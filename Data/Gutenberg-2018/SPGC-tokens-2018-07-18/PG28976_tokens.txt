fought

black
hawk
book
moon
of
ice
the
lodge
of
the
turtle
the
black
bearskin
softened
by
countless
wearings
clasped
gray
arms
and
shoulders
protecting
his
body
from
the
cold
that
cut
like
knives
into
his
cheeks
and
forehead
the
upper
half
of
the
bear
skull
covered
his
head
and
weighed
heavily
on
it
as
heavily
as
the
awful
fear
of
the
vision
quest
weighed
on
his
spirit
his
moccasins
whispered
over
the
fallen
brown
grass
that
covered
the
trail
he
had
walked
a
long
way
and
his
toes
were
numb
in
spite
of
the
leaves
stuffed
into
the
moccasins
abruptly
the
path
stopped
and
he
was
facing
sky
he
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
bluff
looking
eastward
over
the
frozen
great
river
he
gripped
the
deerhorn
handle
of
his
hunting
knife
for
the
feeling
of
strength
it
gave
him
he
slid
the
knife
out
of
the
sheath
of
hardened
leather
tied
to
his
waist
the
steel
blade
glistened
colorless
as
the
sky
above
him
in
the
fading
light
knife
my
father
left
for
he
thought
are
you
tonight
my
father
the
clouds
seemed
close
enough
to
touch
they
rippled
like
snowdrifts
painted
with
light
and
shadow
upriver
the
sky
was
darkened
almost
to
black
and
gray
cloud
smelled
snow
in
the
air
he
saw
the
silhouette
of
a
hawk
feathers
spread
circling
over
the
illinois
country
across
the
river
hunting
in
the
last
moments
before
nightfall
spirit
help
me
to
live
through
this
testing
help
me
to
see
a
great
vision
and
grow
to
be
a
mighty
the
tiny
spot
of
black
dwindled
in
the
sky
till
he
could
no
longer
see
it
it
flies
over
the
winter
silence
of
saukenuk
he
sheathed
the
knife
turning
his
back
on
sky
and
river
he
looked
westward
over
the
way
he
had
come
a
prairie
of
waving
tan
grass
almost
as
high
as
his
head
stretched
as
far
as
he
could
see
killed
by
the
cold
the
grass
yet
stood
held
up
by
the
stiffness
in
its
dead
stalks
like
a
fur
cloak
the
brown
covered
the
hills
that
rolled
away
to
the
west
he
could
not
see
his
people
winter
hunting
camp
from
here
it
nestled
back
among
those
hills
sheltered
in
a
forest
that
grew
along
the
ioway
river
looking
in
its
direction
he
saw
redbird
in
his
mind
her
eyes
black
as
obsidian
arrowheads
shone
at
him
he
felt
a
powerful
yearning
just
to
see
her
to
speak
to
her
and
hear
her
voice
to
touch
her
cheek
with
his
fingertips
the
thought
that
he
might
never
see
her
again
never
go
back
to
his
people
chilled
him
more
than
the
winter
cold
earthmaker
grant
that
i
live
to
return
to
he
knelt
and
peered
over
the
edge
of
the
bluff
the
bearskin
cloak
bunching
around
him
gray
limestone
wrinkled
and
pitted
like
the
face
of
an
old
man
swept
down
to
dark
masses
of
leafless
shrubbery
at
the
river
edge
his
eyes
searched
out
and
then
found
an
especially
black
shadow
in
the
bluff
wall
if
he
had
come
any
later
on
this
day
he
might
not
have
been
able
to
find
the
cave
mouth
in
the
dark
then
he
might
have
had
to
wait
till
morning
or
trying
to
climb
down
to
it
he
might
have
missed
the
way
and
fallen
to
his
death
a
cold
hollow
swelled
in
his
belly
it
would
be
so
easy
to
slip
enough
of
what
might
have
been
it
was
what
would
be
that
frightened
him
now
he
might
die
not
of
falling
but
of
what
he
found
in
the
cave
or
what
found
him
forcing
that
thought
too
out
of
his
mind
he
lowered
his
body
over
the
edge
of
the
bluff
dug
his
toes
into
footholds
and
carefully
climbed
sideways
and
downward
in
places
the
path
along
the
bluff
face
widened
out
and
was
almost
as
easy
to
walk
on
as
a
forest
trail
but
then
the
crumbling
stone
would
slant
steeply
so
that
he
had
to
grip
hard
with
his
feet
feeling
as
if
he
were
clinging
to
nothing
at
all
a
wide
ledge
spread
before
the
entrance
to
the
sacred
cave
he
let
out
a
breath
of
deep
relief
as
his
feet
stepped
firmly
on
the
flat
stone
from
outside
he
could
see
nothing
of
the
cave
but
when
he
entered
he
felt
a
sudden
warmth
as
if
he
were
walking
into
a
lodge
with
a
bright
fire
going
he
could
smell
old
fires
and
something
else
an
animal
smell
that
sent
a
ripple
of
cold
through
his
bones
but
not
a
fresh
smell
he
thanked
earthmaker
for
that
because
he
was
sure
it
was
the
smell
of
bear
but
owl
carver
had
been
using
this
cave
for
his
vision
quests
for
winters
beyond
counting
and
he
had
never
spoken
of
a
bear
gray
cloud
stood
uncertain
in
the
entryway
letting
his
eyes
adjust
to
the
darkness
he
saw
round
gleaming
shapes
clustered
against
the
back
wall
and
a
motionless
figure
about
as
high
as
a
man
waist
with
a
sharply
curved
beak
and
spreading
wings
again
seeing
these
things
he
felt
the
coldness
of
fear
now
he
saw
that
the
round
objects
on
the
floor
were
skulls
and
he
knew
them
for
the
skulls
of
ancestors
great
men
and
women
of
the
tribe
green
and
white
stones
that
had
long
ago
been
necklaces
glittered
around
the
jaws
of
the
great
dead
ones
and
the
winged
figure
standing
over
them
was
the
owl
spirit
who
guided
the
footsteps
of
the
dead
along
the
trail
of
souls
owl
carver
had
earned
his
name
by
carving
this
statue
of
the
spirit
and
setting
it
here
from
a
pouch
tied
to
his
belt
gray
cloud
took
a
handful
of
sacred
tobacco
grains
and
sprinkled
them
on
the
cave
floor
as
an
offering
he
said
give
me
leave
to
enter
your
cave
fathers
and
mothers
you
know
me
i
am
your
child
he
hesitated
only
through
his
mother
sun
woman
was
he
the
child
of
these
ancestors
who
guarded
the
sacred
cave
his
father
was
a
pale
eyes
and
the
pale
eyes
had
no
ancestors
would
the
ancestors
reject
him
there
was
no
sign
or
sound
from
the
skulls
on
the
floor
but
now
he
could
see
farther
into
the
shadows
and
he
saw
that
the
cave
went
on
around
a
bend
and
that
bend
was
guarded
by
another
sacred
figure
he
peered
at
the
shadowy
figure
for
a
moment
and
decided
that
it
was
a
bear
but
a
bear
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
from
head
to
foot
this
bear
was
white
owl
carver
had
said
nothing
about
this
statue
he
sighed
in
his
dread
feeling
a
trembling
in
his
stomach
it
was
good
for
him
to
be
here
he
tried
to
tell
himself
he
had
come
here
to
learn
the
shaman
secrets
this
was
the
moment
he
had
dreamed
of
ever
since
the
first
time
he
had
seen
owl
carver
with
his
long
white
hair
and
his
necklace
of
small
shells
of
the
megis
and
his
cedar
stick
step
into
the
firelight
that
night
owl
carver
had
spoken
not
with
the
voice
of
a
man
but
with
the
voice
of
a
spirit
an
eerily
singsong
that
frightened
and
fascinated
gray
cloud
the
shaman
of
the
tribe
was
greater
than
the
bravest
brave
greater
than
any
chief
he
had
the
power
to
heal
the
sick
and
to
foretell
the
future
gray
cloud
wanted
to
stand
high
among
the
sauk
and
to
go
where
the
shaman
went
into
the
spirit
world
he
wanted
to
penetrate
the
deepest
mysteries
and
know
the
answer
to
every
question
after
he
began
teaching
gray
cloud
owl
carver
had
tried
to
discourage
him
as
a
way
of
testing
him
gray
cloud
was
sure
owl
carver
had
said
times
the
people
do
not
want
to
listen
to
the
shaman
the
truer
his
words
the
less
they
hear
the
warning
had
disturbed
gray
cloud
but
he
never
saw
the
people
refuse
to
listen
to
owl
carver
and
he
did
not
lose
his
determination
to
become
a
shaman
himself
no
one
could
gain
such
a
great
reward
without
risk
a
warrior
must
kill
an
enemy
at
great
peril
to
himself
to
gain
the
right
to
wear
the
eagle
feather
that
marked
him
as
a
brave
a
hunter
had
to
kill
an
animal
that
could
kill
him
before
the
tribe
would
consider
him
a
man
how
then
could
one
speak
to
these
spirits
of
the
tribe
unless
he
too
had
faced
death
but
what
kind
of
a
death
would
he
freeze
and
starve
here
in
this
cave
his
dead
body
remaining
until
owl
carver
came
and
found
it
or
would
an
evil
spirit
come
and
kill
him
whatever
might
come
he
could
only
sit
and
wait
for
it
in
the
way
that
owl
carver
had
taught
him
he
turned
his
back
on
the
unknown
depths
of
the
cave
and
seated
himself
at
its
entrance
pulling
the
bearskin
cloak
around
him
for
warmth
he
dipped
his
fingers
into
a
pouch
at
his
belt
and
took
out
the
bits
of
dried
mushroom
owl
carver
had
given
him
from
a
medicine
bag
decorated
with
a
beadwork
owl
the
sacred
mushrooms
grew
somewhere
far
to
the
south
and
were
traded
up
the
great
river
one
by
one
he
put
them
into
his
mouth
and
slowly
chewed
them
do
not
need
to
owl
carver
had
said
them
in
your
mouth
until
they
slide
down
your
throat
without
your
knowing
how
it
his
mouth
grew
dry
as
the
mushrooms
turned
to
paste
and
it
was
as
owl
carver
had
said
they
were
gone
without
his
knowing
when
they
disappeared
into
his
body
his
stomach
heaved
once
and
he
thought
with
terror
that
he
might
fail
this
first
small
test
but
he
held
his
breath
and
slowly
the
sick
feeling
died
away
the
last
light
faded
from
the
sky
and
the
far
horizon
across
the
river
vanished
blackness
fell
upon
him
like
a
blanket
thick
impenetrable
it
pressed
against
his
face
suffocating
him
the
notches
in
owl
carver
talking
stick
which
the
shaman
had
taught
gray
cloud
to
count
said
that
tonight
the
full
moon
would
rise
it
would
make
no
difference
gray
cloud
would
not
see
the
moon
in
this
sky
filled
with
clouds
a
small
spot
of
cold
struck
his
face
then
another
and
another
his
nose
and
cheeks
felt
wet
snow
the
snow
would
fall
while
he
sat
here
and
he
would
freeze
to
death
he
must
overcome
his
fear
he
must
enter
the
other
world
there
owl
carver
had
promised
him
he
would
be
safe
without
his
spirit
in
his
body
he
could
not
be
hurt
by
the
cold
but
if
fear
kept
him
tied
to
this
world
the
cold
would
kill
him
he
heard
something
a
thumping
and
scraping
behind
him
in
the
cave
something
heavy
shuffling
around
that
bend
he
felt
his
heart
beating
hard
and
fast
in
his
chest
there
something
in
the
cave
he
had
smelled
it
when
he
first
entered
all
the
magic
in
the
world
could
not
save
him
now
he
heard
breath
being
drawn
through
huge
nostrils
long
slow
breaths
of
a
creature
whose
chest
took
a
long
time
to
fill
with
air
he
heard
a
grunting
low
and
determined
the
grunting
changed
to
a
rumbling
growl
that
made
the
floor
of
the
cave
tremble
beneath
him
gray
cloud
breath
came
in
gasps
he
wanted
to
leap
up
and
run
but
owl
carver
had
said
it
was
forbidden
to
move
once
he
seated
himself
in
the
cave
only
his
spirit
was
permitted
to
move
perhaps
if
he
did
everything
exactly
as
owl
carver
had
told
him
he
would
be
safe
but
owl
carver
had
not
told
him
to
expect
such
a
thing
as
this
he
must
not
look
up
the
scratching
of
those
giant
claws
was
right
behind
him
now
he
could
not
breathe
at
all
there
was
a
bright
light
all
around
him
and
yet
he
could
not
see
anything
he
felt
a
heavy
hand
no
weighing
down
on
his
shoulder
and
gripping
it
he
did
not
willingly
turn
his
head
but
his
head
turned
he
did
not
mean
to
lift
his
gaze
but
his
eyes
looked
up
he
saw
something
like
a
vast
white
tree
trunk
beside
his
head
it
was
covered
with
white
fur
claws
gleamed
on
his
shoulder
he
looked
up
and
up
above
him
golden
eyes
blazing
black
jaws
open
and
white
teeth
glistening
like
spearpoints
towered
a
bear
gray
cloud
was
in
the
presence
of
a
spirit
so
mighty
that
his
whole
body
seemed
to
dissolve
in
dread
he
wanted
to
shrink
into
himself
bury
his
face
in
his
arms
but
he
had
no
power
over
his
limbs
the
bear
paw
on
his
shoulder
lifted
him
raising
him
to
his
feet
together
they
walked
out
of
the
cave
what
had
happened
to
the
clouds
and
the
snow
the
sky
was
full
of
stars
that
swept
down
to
form
a
bridge
ending
at
his
feet
the
starlight
cast
a
faint
glow
over
the
ice
on
the
river
and
he
could
see
the
horizon
and
the
opposite
shore
through
the
dusting
of
tiny
sparkling
lights
he
saw
the
ledge
outside
the
mouth
of
the
sacred
cave
two
steps
forward
and
he
would
fall
over
the
edge
and
be
killed
the
white
bear
on
all
fours
beside
him
now
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
him
gray
cloud
knew
somehow
what
was
expected
of
him
he
must
put
his
feet
on
the
bridge
of
stars
and
walk
out
over
empty
air
he
could
not
do
it
terror
clawed
at
his
stomach
as
he
thought
of
standing
high
above
the
river
with
nothing
to
support
him
this
too
was
a
test
the
bridge
would
be
safe
only
if
gray
cloud
trusted
it
from
now
on
everything
that
happened
to
him
would
be
a
test
and
if
he
did
not
master
each
one
in
turn
he
would
never
be
a
shaman
and
what
would
he
be
then
if
he
lived
only
a
boy
the
son
of
a
woman
with
no
husband
the
child
of
a
missing
father
the
boy
they
called
gray
cloud
because
he
was
neither
one
color
nor
the
other
neither
white
nor
red
this
trail
was
the
only
way
for
him
he
must
walk
on
this
bridge
and
if
he
fell
and
died
it
would
not
matter
he
took
the
first
step
for
a
terrifying
moment
his
moccasin
seemed
to
sink
into
the
little
sparks
of
light
rather
than
rest
upon
them
but
it
was
as
if
the
bridge
were
made
of
some
springy
substance
and
the
sole
of
his
foot
did
not
fall
through
it
he
took
another
step
now
he
had
both
feet
on
the
bridge
his
heart
was
thundering
the
blood
roaring
through
his
ears
how
could
a
bridge
be
made
of
nothing
but
light
how
could
a
man
stand
on
it
one
more
step
forward
his
leg
shook
so
hard
he
could
barely
put
his
foot
down
his
knees
quivered
his
body
screamed
at
him
to
go
back
another
step
and
this
would
be
the
hardest
now
he
could
see
the
abyss
below
him
he
was
out
over
it
he
looked
down
his
whole
body
quaking
he
breathed
in
quick
bursts
and
saw
little
clouds
in
front
of
his
face
in
the
starlight
another
step
and
another
for
balance
his
trembling
hands
went
out
from
his
sides
he
looked
down
the
river
was
solid
ice
and
the
stars
reflected
on
its
smooth
black
surface
if
he
fell
he
would
hit
that
ice
so
hard
every
one
of
his
bones
would
break
he
teetered
dizzily
he
looked
to
the
left
and
the
right
and
saw
that
the
edges
of
the
bridge
were
just
on
either
side
of
him
he
could
topple
over
and
nothing
would
stop
him
where
was
the
white
bear
fear
would
make
him
fall
even
if
this
bridge
of
lights
still
held
his
weight
it
was
so
narrow
that
he
must
surely
lose
his
balance
and
die
if
it
holds
me
i
must
be
meant
to
live
and
if
i
am
meant
to
live
i
will
not
be
allowed
to
it
was
only
his
fear
that
was
making
the
bridge
feel
so
precarious
he
knew
that
the
more
he
believed
the
safer
it
would
be
for
him
turn
your
back
on
he
remembered
owl
carver
saying
try
to
drive
it
away
fear
is
your
friend
it
warns
you
of
what
about
when
i
must
face
the
danger
and
not
be
warned
from
it
he
asked
long
as
you
listen
to
its
warning
fear
will
not
stop
you
from
doing
what
you
have
to
do
but
if
you
try
to
pretend
you
do
not
hear
it
fear
will
trip
you
and
bind
you
with
rawhide
gray
cloud
still
afraid
stepped
forward
more
boldly
whatever
spirits
were
making
this
happen
to
him
surely
they
were
not
showing
him
these
wonders
only
then
to
destroy
him
he
was
out
over
the
middle
of
the
river
and
he
heard
a
deep
muttering
behind
him
he
turned
and
it
was
the
white
bear
as
big
as
an
old
bull
buffalo
moving
with
him
on
its
huge
clawed
feet
it
came
up
beside
him
and
he
reached
up
to
touch
its
shoulder
he
knew
now
that
it
was
a
great
spirit
and
that
it
was
his
friend
he
dug
his
fingers
into
the
thick
fur
and
felt
the
warmth
and
the
enormous
powerful
muscle
underneath
joy
flooded
through
him
where
he
had
been
nearly
overcome
with
fear
strength
and
excitement
had
entered
he
ran
up
the
rising
curve
of
the
bridge
he
felt
an
impulse
to
dance
and
he
broke
into
the
half
trot
half
shuffle
of
the
men
when
they
welcomed
the
harvest
of
good
things
to
eat
that
the
women
had
planted
around
saukenuk
village
he
flapped
his
arms
like
the
wild
goose
the
bridge
he
saw
now
did
not
cross
the
river
but
followed
it
he
looked
up
the
trail
of
stars
ended
at
the
one
star
in
the
sky
that
as
owl
carver
had
pointed
out
to
him
remained
fixed
when
all
the
other
stars
danced
around
it
and
therefore
it
was
called
the
council
fire
star
the
little
lights
twinkled
all
around
him
like
flocks
of
bright
birds
and
his
heart
was
full
of
happiness
it
was
all
so
beautiful
he
wanted
to
sing
and
he
did
sing
the
only
song
he
knew
that
seemed
right
for
this
moment
the
song
of
creation
earthmaker
you
fill
the
world
with
life
you
put
life
in
earth
and
sky
and
water
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
earthmaker
but
you
are
in
me
and
everything
that
lives
always
you
have
dwelt
in
life
always
you
will
dwell
so
he
sang
and
danced
and
the
white
bear
rose
up
on
its
hind
legs
and
strode
heavily
along
beside
him
the
light
from
the
council
fire
star
grew
brighter
and
seemed
to
dispel
the
blackness
of
the
sky
around
it
the
star
grew
until
it
was
a
sphere
of
cold
fire
that
filled
the
sky
he
heard
a
roaring
sound
and
saw
that
from
the
bottom
of
the
shining
globe
water
was
pouring
the
water
gave
off
a
light
of
its
own
his
eye
followed
its
plunge
he
was
far
far
above
the
earth
now
the
great
river
was
a
shiny
black
ribbon
barely
visible
winding
over
the
earth
straight
as
a
spear
the
water
from
the
council
fire
star
was
falling
down
to
the
place
where
the
great
river
began
its
winding
course
he
exulted
already
he
had
learned
a
secret
no
other
sauk
knew
unless
it
be
owl
carver
himself
the
true
source
of
the
great
river
he
saw
a
square
dark
opening
in
the
glowing
surface
of
the
star
the
path
led
to
it
still
walking
on
its
hind
legs
the
white
bear
pressed
inexorably
on
toward
that
doorway
and
gray
cloud
walked
beside
it
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
shimmered
in
the
light
from
the
star
and
it
pulsed
faintly
like
a
beating
heart
when
he
thought
of
what
a
mighty
spirit
must
dwell
in
this
magnificent
lodge
perhaps
earthmaker
himself
gray
cloud
heart
was
once
again
full
of
fear
he
trembled
and
his
steps
slowed
he
could
not
come
face
to
face
with
such
a
being
it
would
be
like
staring
into
the
sun
his
eyes
would
be
burned
out
of
his
head
he
felt
himself
weakening
the
surface
under
his
feet
shook
a
little
he
took
a
step
and
it
quivered
under
his
footfall
the
white
bear
was
ahead
of
him
now
leaving
him
out
here
alone
among
the
stars
high
above
the
earth
on
a
bridge
that
was
beginning
to
fall
apart
he
looked
back
over
the
way
he
had
come
there
was
no
bridge
behind
him
nothing
but
a
blackness
he
screamed
waved
his
arms
staggered
he
started
to
run
forward
after
the
bear
his
only
protector
and
his
feet
were
sinking
the
bridge
the
bear
and
the
doorway
and
the
council
fire
star
itself
seemed
farther
and
farther
away
he
fell
to
his
hands
and
knees
afraid
to
stand
any
more
but
what
was
the
fear
trying
to
tell
him
it
was
right
that
gray
cloud
should
be
afraid
meeting
a
spirit
so
much
more
powerful
than
himself
and
now
he
must
trust
that
the
spirit
would
not
hurt
him
with
that
thought
he
felt
the
bridge
growing
more
solid
under
his
hands
he
pushed
himself
back
to
his
feet
he
was
standing
before
the
doorway
all
above
him
and
to
the
sides
stretched
the
curving
shimmering
surface
of
the
council
fire
star
he
did
not
see
the
white
bear
it
must
have
gone
into
the
star
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
taking
his
fear
with
him
he
plunged
through
the
doorway
for
a
moment
light
blinded
him
the
air
was
full
of
a
fluttering
and
a
rustling
his
eyes
grew
used
to
the
light
and
he
saw
that
he
stood
at
the
edge
of
a
pool
full
of
fish
swimming
in
circles
they
were
not
fish
he
knew
but
fish
spirits
the
spirits
of
trout
and
salmon
and
bass
and
walleye
and
sunfish
and
pike
all
the
fish
of
lakes
and
streams
that
fed
his
people
full
of
fear
of
what
else
he
might
see
gray
cloud
raised
his
eyes
he
saw
a
turtle
the
turtle
was
frightfully
big
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
rushing
pool
but
still
he
loomed
over
gray
cloud
his
head
high
in
the
air
his
front
feet
rested
on
a
block
of
ice
behind
him
rose
a
mountain
of
ice
crystals
the
wrinkles
around
his
eyes
and
mouth
told
gray
cloud
he
was
immeasurably
old
gray
cloud
the
turtle
said
you
are
welcome
here
his
voice
was
deep
as
thunder
gray
cloud
fell
again
to
his
hands
and
knees
do
not
be
afraid
gray
cloud
said
the
rumbling
voice
he
looked
up
again
and
saw
kindness
in
the
enormous
yellow
eyes
the
exposed
belly
of
the
turtle
was
the
pale
green
of
spring
leaves
on
his
chest
a
bright
drop
of
water
formed
like
a
dewdrop
or
a
teardrop
but
big
as
a
man
head
after
a
moment
it
fell
and
splashed
into
the
pool
gray
cloud
looked
into
the
bottom
of
the
pool
and
saw
the
blackness
of
a
deep
pit
in
its
center
he
realized
that
it
must
be
from
this
pool
that
the
stream
of
water
poured
down
into
the
great
river
and
the
drops
of
water
falling
from
the
turtle
fed
the
pool
the
true
source
of
the
great
river
was
the
turtle
spirit
heart
owl
carver
had
told
him
of
the
turtle
after
earthmaker
he
was
the
oldest
and
most
powerful
spirit
he
had
helped
to
create
the
world
and
to
keep
it
alive
scarcely
able
to
believe
that
he
was
actually
looking
upon
the
turtle
gray
cloud
lifted
his
gaze
and
saw
that
all
manner
of
beasts
and
birds
occupied
the
ledges
on
the
mountain
all
creation
was
here
trees
maple
ash
elm
oak
hickory
birch
pine
and
spruce
clustered
on
the
mountainside
roots
somehow
drawing
nourishment
from
the
ice
he
said
father
i
thank
you
for
letting
me
come
here
instead
of
answering
him
the
huge
reptilian
head
swung
to
one
side
he
followed
the
gaze
of
the
yellow
eye
a
man
was
standing
near
the
turtle
head
on
one
of
the
ledges
he
was
tall
and
thin
his
eyes
were
round
and
blue
his
face
white
a
pale
eyes
what
would
a
pale
eyes
be
doing
here
in
the
lodge
of
the
turtle
the
man
had
long
black
hair
streaked
with
gray
tied
at
the
back
of
his
head
his
thin
figure
was
dressed
in
a
blue
coat
pinched
at
the
waist
by
a
black
leather
belt
with
a
sword
and
a
pistol
hanging
from
it
his
white
trousers
were
tucked
into
shiny
black
boots
that
came
up
to
his
calves
seeing
the
sword
gray
cloud
thought
this
man
must
be
one
of
the
long
knives
the
dreaded
pale
eyes
warriors
the
man
was
looking
at
gray
cloud
his
face
was
narrow
with
deep
lines
all
the
pale
eyes
gray
cloud
had
seen
had
hairy
faces
thick
mustaches
growing
under
their
noses
and
sometimes
beards
that
spread
out
over
their
chests
but
this
man
face
was
clean
his
nose
was
large
and
hooked
like
a
hawk
beak
gray
cloud
saw
that
the
man
was
weeping
tears
were
running
down
his
creased
cheeks
as
he
stared
at
gray
cloud
the
look
in
those
blue
eyes
gray
cloud
realized
was
not
sadness
but
love
returning
the
man
gaze
gray
cloud
felt
a
warmth
in
his
own
chest
like
the
heat
suddenly
rising
from
a
fire
that
has
taken
hold
i
have
brought
you
to
hear
a
warning
said
the
turtle
his
voice
shaking
gray
cloud
very
bones
you
must
carry
my
words
back
to
my
children
the
sauk
and
fox
as
the
turtle
spoke
another
huge
drop
splashed
into
the
pool
to
add
itself
to
the
great
river
evil
days
are
coming
for
my
children
gray
cloud
quailed
thinking
that
he
did
not
want
to
bring
that
back
to
his
people
but
perhaps
there
was
some
good
word
he
could
tell
them
how
may
we
escape
this
evil
father
turtle
he
asked
this
evil
is
from
the
pale
eyes
at
this
gray
cloud
turned
to
stare
at
the
pale
eyes
man
who
looked
sad
now
even
sombre
who
was
this
man
and
why
was
he
here
the
pale
eyes
and
my
children
can
not
live
on
the
same
land
said
the
turtle
because
they
do
not
live
in
the
same
way
most
pale
eyes
do
not
wish
harm
to
my
children
but
they
do
harm
by
coming
into
the
land
where
my
children
dwell
gray
cloud
at
once
grasped
what
the
turtle
spoke
of
generations
of
sauk
and
their
allies
the
fox
had
lived
in
towns
at
the
joining
of
the
rock
river
and
the
great
river
where
in
summer
they
raised
corn
beans
squash
and
pumpkins
each
fall
they
would
leave
their
towns
and
fields
for
winter
hunting
camps
in
the
west
but
the
pale
eyes
warriors
the
long
knives
had
been
telling
the
sauk
and
fox
that
they
must
give
up
all
their
land
on
the
east
side
of
the
great
river
even
their
principal
town
saukenuk
and
move
forever
west
into
the
ioway
country
and
the
war
chief
black
hawk
had
defied
the
long
knives
leading
his
people
each
spring
back
across
the
river
to
farm
the
land
around
saukenuk
gray
cloud
knew
that
even
the
kindliest
pale
eyes
were
not
to
be
trusted
owl
carver
was
suspicious
of
the
medicine
man
père
isaac
who
talked
about
the
spirit
called
jesus
and
who
spent
many
afternoons
with
gray
cloud
teaching
him
the
words
and
signs
of
the
american
pale
eyes
the
turtle
voice
broke
in
upon
these
memories
tell
my
children
that
a
great
clash
is
to
come
between
them
and
the
long
knives
the
people
will
suffer
and
many
of
them
will
die
gray
cloud
gasped
as
the
horror
of
that
sank
in
he
looked
again
at
the
pale
eyes
and
now
where
there
had
been
love
he
saw
lines
of
sorrow
carved
deep
into
the
thin
face
this
man
then
a
danger
to
me
is
there
no
escape
father
turtle
he
asked
again
the
people
must
walk
their
path
with
courage
said
the
turtle
black
hawk
will
lead
them
and
he
and
his
braves
will
show
the
greatest
courage
such
courage
that
the
name
of
black
hawk
will
never
be
forgotten
in
the
land
where
he
was
born
the
turtle
golden
eye
seemed
to
fix
itself
on
gray
cloud
and
you
will
find
your
own
path
for
some
of
the
people
the
path
you
find
will
be
good
but
many
others
will
journey
in
sorrow
into
the
setting
sun
and
there
they
will
disappear
forever
bewildered
gray
cloud
looked
from
the
turtle
to
the
pale
eyes
near
him
and
back
to
the
turtle
again
these
things
the
turtle
had
said
were
strange
like
the
words
owl
carver
would
chant
before
the
council
fire
must
he
bring
his
people
a
message
of
suffering
and
sorrow
would
they
listen
he
wanted
to
ask
more
questions
but
he
felt
a
gentle
pressure
from
the
great
body
of
the
bear
beside
him
and
he
knew
that
his
visit
to
the
lodge
of
the
turtle
was
ended
the
spirit
bear
redbird
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
hunting
camp
beside
the
grove
of
trees
where
the
band
horses
were
sheltering
from
the
falling
snow
her
tears
mingled
with
the
snowflakes
melting
on
her
face
wherever
she
looked
a
white
curtain
hid
the
land
would
gray
cloud
die
the
thought
made
her
heart
feel
as
if
a
fist
was
squeezing
it
yesterday
at
midday
her
father
had
sent
gray
cloud
on
his
vision
quest
and
in
the
most
dangerous
time
of
the
year
the
moon
of
ice
when
the
spirits
harvested
the
living
leaving
only
the
strongest
to
survive
through
to
the
spring
and
just
as
night
fell
the
snow
had
begun
would
the
spirits
take
gray
cloud
tears
burned
her
eyes
and
she
felt
dizzy
she
had
not
slept
all
last
night
and
she
had
waited
and
watched
through
the
day
as
she
stood
looking
eastward
where
gray
cloud
had
gone
on
his
spirit
journey
it
came
to
her
that
he
might
already
be
dead
the
wind
must
have
been
blowing
snow
into
the
sacred
cave
all
night
and
all
day
gray
cloud
in
a
trance
might
already
have
frozen
to
death
she
might
be
weeping
for
a
dead
man
she
sobbed
aloud
and
put
her
hands
in
squirrelskin
mittens
to
her
face
the
snow
on
the
mittens
felt
barely
colder
than
her
cheeks
a
flash
of
light
brighter
than
the
sun
blinded
her
a
tremendous
roar
of
thunder
almost
knocked
her
to
the
ground
another
bright
flash
made
her
cover
her
eyes
in
dismay
and
in
a
moment
there
was
another
long
rolling
rumble
people
stood
at
the
doorways
of
their
wickiups
murmuring
to
one
another
thunder
with
a
snowstorm
this
was
the
heaviest
snowstorm
of
the
year
so
far
and
a
snowstorm
with
thunder
and
lightning
foretold
some
great
event
much
snow
lay
on
the
rounded
roofs
of
the
wickiups
and
some
women
took
whisks
of
bundled
twigs
to
brush
it
away
so
that
it
would
not
break
down
the
framework
of
poles
or
melt
through
the
roofs
of
elm
bark
and
cattail
mats
and
wet
the
people
inside
and
their
possessions
the
snow
was
dry
and
powdery
because
the
air
was
so
cold
and
it
brushed
away
easily
the
snow
was
already
halfway
up
redbird
laced
deerskin
boots
she
felt
the
bitter
cold
numbing
her
feet
and
legs
what
must
it
be
like
for
gray
cloud
she
saw
him
as
vividly
as
if
he
were
standing
before
her
how
very
tall
he
was
almost
as
tall
as
her
brother
iron
knife
but
gray
frame
was
slender
not
broad
and
powerful
like
iron
knife
she
saw
gray
cloud
tender
mouth
curving
in
a
tentative
smile
his
sharp
nose
giving
strength
to
his
face
his
large
eyes
glowing
his
skin
so
much
lighter
than
any
other
man
in
the
british
band
of
the
sauk
and
fox
and
she
asked
herself
was
it
not
partly
because
of
the
mystery
of
gray
cloud
father
that
she
found
herself
drawn
to
him
pale
eyes
fascinated
her
the
few
she
had
met
jean
de
vilbiss
the
trader
the
medicine
man
called
père
isaac
every
summer
when
père
isaac
visited
saukenuk
village
he
took
gray
cloud
aside
teaching
him
strange
words
showing
him
how
to
understand
the
meaning
of
marks
on
paper
and
how
to
make
such
marks
how
she
envied
gray
cloud
and
wished
that
père
isaac
would
teach
her
those
things
too
redbird
wondered
why
pale
eyes
were
so
different
and
why
they
had
so
much
power
no
sauk
craftsman
could
make
anything
like
the
steel
swords
that
pale
eyes
warriors
carried
whence
they
were
called
long
knives
the
steel
tomahawks
that
the
pale
eyes
traded
for
furs
could
shatter
a
sauk
tomahawk
into
fragments
a
pale
eyes
fire
weapon
of
course
was
something
every
warrior
of
the
sauk
and
fox
tribes
yearned
for
but
what
interested
redbird
most
were
the
steel
sewing
needles
and
iron
cooking
pots
and
calico
dresses
and
wool
blankets
she
wondered
why
earthmaker
had
given
the
knowledge
of
how
to
make
such
things
to
the
pale
eyes
but
not
to
the
sauk
and
fox
her
people
wore
the
skins
of
animals
scraped
and
pushed
and
pulled
and
tanned
with
the
brains
and
women
urine
until
they
were
soft
and
pliant
and
could
be
worn
comfortably
next
to
the
skin
but
the
clothing
of
the
pale
eyes
was
more
comfortable
and
easier
to
keep
clean
and
more
colorful
sauk
and
fox
shirts
and
leggings
and
skirts
unless
painted
or
decorated
with
dyed
quills
were
usually
the
brown
or
tan
of
animal
skins
the
best
deerskin
garments
were
worked
till
they
were
white
the
dresses
and
shawls
and
blankets
the
pale
eyes
traders
offered
were
of
many
colors
blue
and
yellow
red
and
green
with
flowers
and
other
pictures
and
designs
on
them
redbird
often
spent
long
moments
staring
at
the
good
calico
dress
her
father
owl
carver
had
gotten
for
her
from
the
pale
eyes
traders
just
delighting
in
the
tiny
red
roses
printed
on
its
pale
blue
background
for
a
moment
lost
in
thought
about
the
pale
eyes
she
had
forgotten
gray
cloud
danger
and
her
own
pain
now
it
came
back
to
her
like
a
war
club
crushing
her
chest
soon
it
would
be
night
again
gray
cloud
had
been
in
the
cave
a
whole
night
and
a
whole
day
while
the
snow
fell
and
the
snow
was
falling
still
if
someone
did
not
rescue
him
he
would
surely
die
she
would
go
to
her
father
owl
carver
and
demand
that
gray
cloud
be
brought
back
from
the
sacred
cave
she
turned
and
pushed
her
feet
through
the
fresh
snow
hurrying
past
the
wickiups
of
the
british
band
winter
camp
in
ioway
country
a
dog
burst
out
of
wolf
paw
doorway
and
floundered
through
the
snow
its
short
pointed
ears
flattened
barking
at
her
wolf
paw
dogs
were
a
nuisance
barking
and
snapping
at
anyone
who
passed
near
his
dwelling
the
dog
stopped
barking
and
she
heard
footsteps
squeaking
in
the
snow
she
stopped
and
turned
wolf
paw
himself
was
standing
before
his
wickiup
beside
the
tall
pole
from
whose
top
hung
six
sioux
scalps
he
had
taken
last
winter
wolf
paw
glowered
at
her
arms
folded
under
a
bright
red
blanket
three
short
black
stripes
near
one
edge
were
the
pale
eyes
trader
guarantee
that
the
blanket
was
of
highest
quality
despite
the
snow
wolf
head
was
uncovered
all
shaved
except
for
the
crest
of
deer
hair
in
the
middle
three
black
and
white
eagle
feathers
were
tied
into
it
redbird
did
not
like
wolf
paw
he
never
let
people
forget
that
he
was
the
son
of
the
great
war
chief
black
hawk
whose
wickiup
lay
only
a
short
distance
from
his
own
he
never
smiled
and
she
knew
very
well
what
he
was
thinking
when
he
looked
at
her
she
turned
without
a
greeting
and
walked
on
kicking
the
snow
as
she
went
but
the
sight
of
wolf
paw
had
reminded
her
that
though
owl
carver
was
her
father
she
still
had
only
a
woman
influence
the
spirit
journey
of
gray
cloud
was
a
matter
for
men
owl
carver
loved
her
and
was
good
to
her
but
if
she
tried
to
interfere
in
his
holy
calling
he
would
be
furious
he
would
never
agree
to
bring
gray
cloud
down
from
the
cave
before
he
came
down
on
his
own
such
a
thing
was
against
the
way
of
the
shaman
she
was
still
wondering
what
she
dared
say
when
she
came
to
her
wickiup
and
found
owl
carver
standing
beside
it
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
staring
eastward
toward
the
great
river
as
she
shuffled
through
the
snow
toward
him
he
turned
and
held
out
his
hands
when
she
reached
him
he
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
she
peered
into
his
face
hard
to
see
now
that
night
had
fallen
and
tried
to
read
it
owl
carver
face
was
flat
his
long
white
hair
was
bound
at
his
forehead
with
a
beaded
band
and
fell
from
there
to
his
shoulders
spreading
like
a
white
shawl
his
necklace
of
little
round
striped
shells
of
the
water
creatures
called
megis
rattled
in
the
wind
she
trembled
inwardly
in
his
presence
the
shaman
of
the
tribe
could
both
heal
and
kill
how
can
he
live
in
this
blizzard
she
said
almost
weeping
did
you
not
see
the
lightning
my
daughter
and
hear
the
thunder
do
you
think
that
merely
betokens
a
young
man
freezing
to
death
hear
me
once
in
a
thousand
years
a
man
comes
among
us
who
is
capable
of
being
a
great
shaman
of
being
to
other
shamans
like
myself
what
earthmaker
is
to
the
lesser
spirits
of
beasts
and
birds
but
to
be
known
and
to
discover
the
greatness
of
his
powers
such
a
man
must
be
as
greatly
tested
i
saw
in
gray
cloud
a
man
beyond
the
ordinary
owl
carver
willingness
to
talk
made
redbird
feel
bolder
surely
gray
cloud
has
been
in
the
sacred
cave
long
enough
my
father
will
you
not
go
now
and
bring
him
down
he
pushed
her
away
staring
at
her
earthmaker
decides
what
is
enough
a
man
must
to
be
worthy
of
the
power
his
spirit
guide
bestows
on
him
when
i
first
began
to
walk
the
shaman
path
i
wandered
far
away
into
the
great
desert
of
the
west
and
nearly
died
of
hunger
and
thirst
i
did
not
suffer
as
much
as
gray
cloud
is
suffering
but
that
is
because
he
can
be
a
much
greater
shaman
than
i
if
he
lives
if
he
does
not
live
he
is
like
a
foal
born
lame
in
the
springtime
the
wolves
must
get
him
it
is
earthmaker
way
frightened
though
she
was
redbird
forced
herself
to
speak
up
there
is
suffering
that
even
the
strongest
can
not
bear
owl
carver
took
a
step
toward
her
his
eyes
round
with
anger
remember
what
the
law
of
the
sauk
and
fox
decrees
for
anyone
who
disturbs
a
man
on
a
spirit
journey
even
to
help
him
they
take
you
to
the
great
river
in
the
summer
they
would
throw
you
in
with
rocks
tied
to
you
in
this
season
they
chop
a
hole
in
the
ice
and
they
push
you
in
the
current
flows
swiftly
under
the
ice
it
carries
you
away
from
the
opening
and
you
drown
there
in
the
cold
and
dark
redbird
shrank
back
owl
carver
had
felt
her
pain
when
she
first
came
to
him
but
now
he
was
angry
she
sensed
that
behind
that
anger
there
lurked
fear
fear
that
she
might
risk
her
life
for
gray
cloud
your
mother
has
been
calling
for
you
he
said
go
and
help
her
with
her
work
afraid
to
say
any
more
redbird
hurried
past
him
and
lifted
the
heavy
buffalo
skin
that
covered
the
doorway
of
the
family
wickiup
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
once
and
saw
that
her
father
was
once
again
looking
toward
the
river
where
gray
cloud
had
gone
owl
carver
held
his
hands
behind
his
back
knotting
them
together
he
was
afraid
for
gray
cloud
too
as
she
sensed
that
her
heart
sank
further
entering
the
wickiup
she
saw
silhouetted
against
the
light
of
the
low
fire
in
the
center
a
figure
rising
up
big
as
a
buffalo
her
half
brother
iron
knife
redbird
took
his
hands
in
greeting
gray
cloud
will
be
well
iron
knife
said
in
a
low
gruff
voice
iron
knife
was
always
kind
to
her
she
was
grateful
for
his
words
but
she
knew
they
were
no
more
than
a
wish
though
iron
knife
was
the
son
of
owl
carver
by
his
first
wife
he
had
not
a
trace
of
the
shaman
ability
to
foretell
events
iron
knife
could
see
only
with
his
eyes
hear
only
with
his
ears
his
mother
had
died
giving
birth
to
him
and
there
were
those
who
said
the
spirits
had
chosen
to
give
him
no
gifts
because
he
had
killed
his
mother
redbird
had
even
heard
that
while
in
mourning
owl
carver
had
predicted
that
iron
knife
would
one
day
be
killed
by
a
man
whose
mother
had
also
died
giving
birth
to
him
no
one
dared
speak
of
these
things
in
iron
knife
presence
redbird
knew
she
had
more
of
the
shaman
in
her
than
iron
knife
she
knew
as
her
father
did
that
right
now
gray
cloud
was
in
terrible
danger
where
have
you
been
wind
bends
grass
called
out
from
the
shadows
she
and
redbird
sisters
were
already
bedded
down
for
the
night
on
pallets
along
the
wall
of
the
wickiup
wind
bends
grass
and
her
two
little
girls
wild
grape
and
robin
nest
slept
together
for
greater
warmth
i
was
down
in
the
woods
seeing
to
our
horses
redbird
lied
she
had
been
near
the
horses
but
only
to
watch
for
gray
cloud
i
needed
you
here
wind
bends
grass
said
crossly
i
was
stringing
beads
for
a
new
sash
for
your
father
and
your
sisters
are
too
small
to
help
me
my
mother
want
me
to
string
beads
while
gray
cloud
freezes
to
death
the
snow
was
heavy
on
the
horses
backs
redbird
said
they
needed
someone
to
brush
them
off
nonsense
said
wind
bends
grass
sitting
up
you
were
waiting
and
worrying
for
that
pale
eyes
boy
and
meanwhile
wolf
paw
came
again
to
speak
to
your
father
today
how
can
you
refuse
the
son
of
the
mighty
black
hawk
and
think
of
marrying
that
boy
who
has
no
father
his
mother
lay
with
a
pale
eyes
and
got
gray
cloud
the
pale
eyes
lived
with
her
only
five
summers
and
then
ran
away
he
would
have
run
away
sooner
but
our
people
held
him
prisoner
because
of
the
war
redbird
heard
muffled
giggles
from
the
bedding
beside
her
mother
her
little
sisters
thought
the
story
of
gray
cloud
parentage
funny
wind
bends
grass
struck
with
her
hand
at
the
two
shaking
bundles
wolf
paw
already
has
a
wife
redbird
said
he
is
a
said
wind
bends
grass
a
brave
he
can
make
two
wives
three
wives
wives
happy
rage
at
her
mother
for
belittling
gray
cloud
when
he
might
be
dying
boiled
up
inside
her
and
almost
choked
her
she
bit
her
lip
and
held
back
the
angry
words
she
hurt
too
much
to
want
to
quarrel
she
took
off
her
fur
cap
wet
boots
and
mittens
and
laid
them
near
the
fire
keeping
on
her
cloak
her
doeskin
dress
and
leggings
she
lay
down
on
her
own
pallet
padded
with
blankets
and
prairie
grass
curling
up
her
legs
she
wrapped
the
heavy
cloak
around
herself
the
wickiup
was
quiet
except
for
the
popping
of
burning
twigs
redbird
knew
that
her
fear
for
gray
cloud
deepening
as
the
night
deepened
would
keep
her
awake
she
decided
that
when
they
were
all
asleep
she
would
go
back
to
the
wickiup
of
sun
woman
and
watch
with
her
she
lay
staring
at
the
blackened
ceiling
that
arched
over
her
head
partly
obscured
by
drifting
smoke
the
curved
poles
cast
deep
shadows
in
the
flickering
light
iron
knife
had
laid
fresh
branches
on
the
fire
smoke
stung
her
eyes
sometimes
she
thought
she
saw
spirit
messages
above
her
in
the
patterns
of
the
twigs
interwoven
with
the
larger
poles
and
in
the
cracks
in
the
sheets
of
bark
that
lined
the
inside
of
the
wickiup
but
tonight
her
mind
was
too
absorbed
in
gray
cloud
fate
to
try
to
read
the
patterns
over
the
breathing
of
the
others
she
could
hear
the
voice
of
the
wind
humming
across
the
roof
from
time
to
time
it
would
rise
to
a
howl
and
the
framework
of
the
wickiup
would
creak
and
crackle
under
the
strain
even
though
there
was
a
fire
and
the
wickiup
was
tightly
sealed
redbird
felt
the
cold
seeping
up
from
the
earth
its
icy
fingers
touched
her
body
through
the
buffalo
robe
her
dread
for
gray
cloud
turned
to
panic
i
feel
the
cold
here
in
my
warm
wickiup
what
must
it
be
like
for
him
after
the
snow
stopped
falling
the
cold
of
this
night
would
be
the
cold
that
killed
without
mercy
such
a
deepening
cold
often
seemed
to
follow
a
great
snow
after
a
night
like
this
women
would
find
rabbit
and
deer
lying
in
the
drifts
near
the
camp
the
animals
trying
to
get
close
to
warmth
had
overcome
their
fear
of
people
but
the
cold
had
leeched
the
life
from
their
bodies
even
the
strongest
animals
might
die
only
people
to
whom
earthmaker
had
given
the
knowledge
of
how
to
shelter
themselves
and
make
fire
could
withstand
this
cold
her
fists
clenched
on
the
blanket
her
heart
filled
up
with
anger
anger
against
the
cold
against
her
mother
who
despised
gray
cloud
against
owl
carver
who
had
sent
him
to
almost
certain
death
against
the
spirits
who
had
permitted
this
out
of
her
anger
blazed
up
a
fierce
resolve
will
not
let
you
take
him
from
if
everyone
else
accepted
gray
cloud
death
she
did
not
she
would
go
to
him
she
would
go
to
sun
woman
and
gather
what
medicines
she
might
have
anything
that
would
keep
the
cold
from
draining
the
last
bit
of
warmth
and
strength
out
of
gray
cloud
you
not
been
told
what
the
tribe
decrees
for
anyone
who
disturbs
a
man
on
a
spirit
journey
even
to
help
him
her
anger
turned
to
fear
and
she
lay
there
not
wanting
to
move
knowing
that
if
she
threw
off
the
blankets
and
stood
up
she
would
be
taking
the
first
step
on
a
path
that
might
be
her
death
but
then
she
thought
of
that
terrible
wind
sharp
as
a
pale
eyes
steel
knife
shrieking
around
gray
cloud
body
if
she
did
something
now
he
might
live
and
if
she
did
nothing
he
was
sure
to
die
she
had
loved
gray
cloud
for
as
long
as
she
could
remember
to
be
without
him
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
she
had
heard
tales
of
women
who
died
fighting
beside
their
men
yes
better
to
die
with
gray
cloud
to
walk
the
trail
of
souls
into
the
west
with
him
than
live
a
long
life
grieving
for
him
she
listened
to
the
sounds
of
the
sleepers
iron
knife
rumbling
snore
wind
bends
grass
heavy
breathing
that
sounded
like
her
name
the
rustlings
and
murmurings
of
wild
grape
and
robin
nest
owl
carver
still
had
not
come
in
and
he
might
stay
out
there
most
of
the
night
she
dared
not
wait
any
longer
she
would
have
to
face
him
silently
she
pushed
off
her
coverings
and
stood
up
she
quickly
put
back
on
her
fur
cap
boots
and
mittens
the
deepened
cold
bit
into
her
cheeks
like
a
weasel
teeth
while
she
had
lain
in
the
wickiup
the
snow
which
had
been
falling
continually
for
a
night
and
a
day
had
stopped
at
last
the
clouds
overhead
were
breaking
up
and
she
could
see
the
full
moon
round
and
bright
as
a
pale
eyes
silver
coin
the
moon
of
ice
it
seemed
frozen
in
place
in
the
black
sky
stars
glittered
little
chips
of
ice
with
her
first
indrawn
breath
the
insides
of
her
nostrils
seemed
to
freeze
the
air
burned
in
her
nose
and
throat
her
heart
quailed
for
gray
cloud
the
black
figure
of
owl
carver
stood
just
where
she
had
left
him
how
could
he
stand
the
cold
this
long
owl
carver
turned
to
her
where
are
you
going
to
sun
woman
wickiup
to
watch
with
her
she
hated
owl
carver
he
was
the
one
who
had
sent
gray
cloud
on
this
spirit
journey
and
now
would
do
nothing
to
save
him
from
death
as
if
sensing
her
agony
he
said
the
spirits
will
watch
over
gray
cloud
she
wanted
to
believe
him
but
she
could
not
she
had
begged
him
to
help
gray
cloud
and
he
had
commanded
her
to
be
silent
now
she
had
no
more
to
say
to
him
she
turned
from
owl
carver
he
could
have
forbidden
her
to
go
to
sun
woman
but
he
would
not
do
that
there
was
an
understanding
between
redbird
and
her
father
that
she
could
not
put
into
words
she
knew
that
when
he
looked
at
her
he
was
torn
between
pride
that
she
the
oldest
of
his
children
by
wind
bends
grass
possessed
the
same
gifts
he
did
and
sorrow
that
she
was
a
woman
and
could
never
be
a
shaman
and
she
knew
that
of
all
his
children
he
loved
her
best
the
snow
blown
off
the
roofs
of
the
wickiups
piled
up
in
long
drifts
on
their
western
sides
the
east
wind
battered
redbird
as
she
plodded
through
the
winter
camp
toward
one
low
rounded
black
structure
that
rose
out
of
the
snow
a
bit
apart
from
the
others
on
the
north
side
of
the
camp
the
skinned
quarters
of
small
animals
hung
frozen
from
a
rack
outside
sun
woman
doorway
redbird
went
up
to
the
flap
of
buffalo
hide
and
called
it
is
redbird
may
i
come
in
redbird
heard
sun
woman
undoing
the
sinew
laces
that
held
the
flap
down
she
bent
and
entered
in
the
firelight
within
sun
woman
wickiup
redbird
saw
agony
in
the
tightness
of
the
older
woman
wide
mouth
and
the
clenching
of
her
strong
jaw
gray
cloud
mother
was
built
big
with
broad
shoulders
and
hips
and
large
hands
but
there
was
a
helplessness
now
in
the
way
she
stood
staring
into
the
fire
hanging
from
the
curving
bark
wall
behind
her
were
her
craft
objects
a
medicine
bundle
of
deerskin
the
carved
figures
of
a
naked
man
and
a
naked
woman
clamshells
to
mold
maple
sugar
a
horse
tail
dyed
red
a
small
drum
and
a
flute
redbird
spoke
in
a
rush
if
he
dies
i
do
not
want
to
live
she
feared
that
if
she
tried
to
address
sun
woman
properly
her
voice
would
be
choked
by
sobs
before
she
could
say
what
demanded
to
be
said
she
should
not
even
suggest
to
gray
cloud
mother
that
he
might
die
and
she
should
not
even
hint
to
his
mother
of
her
love
for
gray
cloud
when
neither
sun
woman
nor
owl
carver
had
spoken
to
each
other
of
plans
for
their
children
the
band
would
be
appalled
at
such
rudeness
forgive
me
for
speaking
so
to
you
she
said
timidly
sun
woman
smiled
but
redbird
saw
that
there
was
much
sadness
in
the
smile
you
know
you
can
yes
you
are
different
redbird
said
though
the
pale
eyes
killed
your
husband
you
took
a
pale
eyes
into
your
this
had
happened
more
than
fifteen
winters
ago
and
redbird
knew
it
only
as
a
story
that
her
mother
and
other
women
liked
to
repeat
while
they
did
their
work
together
sun
woman
husband
a
brave
named
dark
water
had
been
killed
in
a
quarrel
with
pale
eyes
settlers
in
spite
of
that
when
gray
cloud
pale
eyes
father
came
to
live
with
the
sauk
sun
woman
had
come
to
love
him
i
am
different
too
said
redbird
she
wondered
if
sun
woman
knew
how
different
she
was
most
women
lived
from
season
to
season
while
redbird
sometimes
thought
about
what
the
tribe
might
be
doing
where
they
might
be
ten
summers
from
now
only
two
kinds
of
people
thought
the
kind
of
long
thoughts
that
came
often
to
redbird
chiefs
and
shamans
she
sometimes
imagined
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
a
shaman
to
live
in
accord
with
the
gift
earthmaker
gave
her
she
thought
so
often
about
it
that
it
became
a
longing
within
her
even
though
she
knew
that
such
a
thing
could
not
be
this
redbird
thought
was
the
most
she
could
hope
for
to
become
a
medicine
woman
like
gray
cloud
mother
a
medicine
woman
had
an
important
place
in
the
band
but
she
was
not
listened
to
as
the
shaman
was
sun
woman
reached
out
and
laid
her
bare
hand
on
top
of
redbird
which
was
still
in
a
mitten
that
is
why
i
would
be
pleased
if
you
and
my
son
shared
a
wickiup
redbird
was
startled
and
amidst
her
fear
and
grief
for
gray
cloud
delighted
truly
no
mother
ever
spoke
like
this
before
words
between
parents
had
been
exchanged
and
to
know
that
sun
woman
would
accept
her
as
her
son
wife
wondrous
but
gray
cloud
might
already
be
dead
how
can
we
talk
and
smile
so
she
cried
he
is
up
in
the
sacred
cave
and
the
snow
fell
all
last
night
and
all
day
today
sun
woman
shook
her
head
when
i
gave
the
boy
to
owl
carver
i
gave
up
the
right
to
say
what
was
to
be
done
with
him
like
owl
carver
gray
cloud
belongs
to
the
spirits
now
but
the
spirits
redbird
waved
her
hands
helplessly
they
protect
as
they
like
and
they
let
death
strike
as
they
like
a
shadow
of
pain
crossed
sun
woman
face
do
you
say
such
things
to
hurt
me
redbird
was
shocked
no
do
you
think
i
feel
no
pain
redbird
felt
tears
filling
her
eyes
burning
them
she
wiped
her
face
i
know
you
do
sun
woman
brought
her
face
closer
to
redbird
took
redbird
chin
in
her
hand
and
said
i
do
not
show
pain
because
i
do
not
want
to
make
others
suffer
with
me
but
you
know
what
i
feel
sun
woman
opened
her
arms
and
redbird
pressed
her
body
against
the
bigger
older
woman
she
felt
sun
woman
strength
flow
into
her
and
she
knew
that
she
had
found
more
comfort
here
than
she
ever
would
in
the
arms
of
her
own
mother
in
the
firelit
wickiup
redbird
looked
around
her
thinking
that
this
was
where
gray
cloud
had
been
a
baby
she
looked
at
the
bench
where
she
knew
he
slept
every
night
where
he
must
sleep
again
do
you
have
anything
to
give
a
person
who
has
been
very
cold
for
a
long
time
redbird
asked
urgently
ah
sun
woman
went
to
the
back
of
the
wickiup
and
came
back
with
a
bundle
of
long
dark
red
peppers
these
peppers
are
grown
far
to
the
south
where
the
sacred
mushroom
and
the
bright
blue
stones
come
from
the
longer
you
boil
them
the
hotter
the
water
will
get
he
is
to
drink
the
water
but
not
swallow
the
peppers
if
he
is
very
cold
give
him
one
pepper
to
chew
on
that
would
bring
the
dead
back
to
life
if
you
meet
him
before
i
do
this
is
how
you
can
help
him
thinks
i
mean
to
try
to
meet
him
when
he
comes
i
will
go
to
him
redbird
said
abruptly
sun
woman
stared
at
her
you
must
not
if
you
interrupt
his
spirit
journey
it
might
kill
him
he
has
been
in
a
cave
for
a
night
and
a
day
and
this
is
the
second
night
colder
than
any
night
i
can
remember
my
father
watches
for
him
but
he
does
not
come
he
could
still
be
sitting
in
that
cave
he
has
no
fire
he
has
no
food
or
water
the
wind
blows
in
from
the
river
the
snow
here
at
the
camp
is
so
deep
that
in
some
places
the
drifts
are
over
my
head
the
cave
could
be
full
of
snow
when
he
is
suffering
all
this
how
can
you
say
that
am
a
danger
to
him
sun
woman
sat
on
the
rush
mat
floor
and
stared
down
at
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
after
a
silence
she
looked
up
and
her
grave
dark
eyes
held
redbird
you
are
a
good
young
woman
and
you
love
my
son
but
you
must
understand
that
the
greater
danger
to
gray
cloud
is
not
from
the
cold
if
you
try
to
wake
gray
cloud
body
when
his
soul
is
gone
from
it
his
spirit
will
never
come
back
to
his
empty
body
it
will
set
its
feet
on
the
trail
of
souls
and
walk
west
to
the
land
of
the
dead
sun
woman
eyes
shone
and
the
shadows
and
firelight
gave
her
the
face
of
an
angry
spirit
redbird
drew
back
i
will
not
do
that
she
said
i
promise
you
but
if
she
saw
that
gray
cloud
would
surely
die
anyway
of
freezing
would
it
not
then
be
best
to
take
the
risk
of
waking
him
and
what
if
he
did
wake
on
his
own
but
was
too
frozen
to
climb
out
of
the
cave
and
walk
back
to
the
camp
by
himself
then
he
would
need
her
help
she
decided
that
if
she
got
to
the
cave
and
his
spirit
was
still
out
of
his
body
she
would
do
everything
to
help
him
short
of
waking
him
she
would
build
a
fire
near
him
she
would
cover
him
with
warm
cloaks
try
to
warm
his
body
if
she
could
do
that
without
disturbing
him
she
boiled
the
peppers
in
a
small
tin
pot
set
on
stones
over
sun
low
fire
after
she
had
filled
a
skin
with
the
pepper
water
she
rolled
tinder
and
a
pale
eyes
fire
striker
into
a
blanket
she
put
her
hand
on
sun
woman
snowshoes
leaning
against
a
wall
of
the
little
wickiup
and
sun
woman
nodded
silently
redbird
paddled
over
the
snow
with
her
head
down
watching
the
long
shadow
she
cast
under
the
full
moon
on
the
sparkling
white
surface
ahead
the
leeward
sides
of
the
wickiups
were
rows
of
snowdrifts
all
the
same
size
when
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
their
windward
sides
were
like
black
holes
in
the
snow
she
could
see
her
family
wickiup
but
owl
carver
was
no
longer
standing
outside
watching
she
lifted
her
round
wickerwork
snowshoes
high
with
each
step
even
though
she
could
walk
over
the
snow
she
would
be
exhausted
she
realized
long
before
she
pushed
her
way
to
the
sacred
cave
dogs
barked
fear
made
the
back
of
her
neck
tingle
and
she
stood
motionless
they
might
be
wolf
paw
dogs
but
they
did
not
come
after
her
she
heard
no
sounds
of
voices
or
of
people
moving
she
felt
safe
enough
to
keep
walking
but
a
feeling
grew
on
her
that
someone
was
following
her
she
stopped
again
and
listened
and
looked
around
the
wickiups
were
silent
under
their
glistening
hummocks
being
able
to
sense
when
she
was
being
watched
was
one
of
the
gifts
she
like
her
father
possessed
but
her
eyes
and
ears
did
not
confirm
what
her
inner
sense
told
her
she
decided
fear
was
confusing
her
and
she
walked
on
she
left
the
camp
behind
on
her
right
was
gently
rolling
prairie
on
her
left
were
the
woods
that
grew
along
the
ioway
river
she
saw
the
shadows
of
the
horses
among
the
trees
heard
them
snort
and
stamp
their
feet
beside
the
woods
ran
the
long
trail
leading
to
the
bluff
where
the
sacred
cave
overlooked
the
river
this
close
to
the
trees
she
hoped
the
snow
would
not
be
so
deep
a
shadow
appeared
on
the
snow
beside
her
a
bolt
of
terror
stabbed
her
a
powerful
hand
seized
her
arm
she
felt
paralyzed
like
a
rabbit
about
to
be
torn
apart
by
a
wildcat
she
did
not
try
to
pull
away
she
could
feel
that
the
grip
on
her
arm
was
too
strong
she
turned
slowly
the
moon
was
behind
the
man
who
held
her
shadowing
his
face
but
she
could
make
out
the
glitter
of
piercing
eyes
a
stern
mouth
with
strong
lips
under
his
brown
fur
turban
where
are
you
going
wolf
paw
fingers
hurt
her
arm
no
words
came
to
her
frantically
she
tried
to
think
of
some
excuse
for
walking
out
so
late
on
a
night
like
this
he
could
have
her
killed
she
thought
and
terror
made
her
feel
like
sinking
into
the
snow
but
then
she
remembered
some
of
the
lore
sun
woman
had
taught
her
my
father
sent
me
to
look
for
a
certain
herb
whose
power
is
greatest
when
the
moon
is
full
he
barked
disdainfully
gathering
herbs
when
the
snow
is
up
to
your
knees
it
grows
under
the
snow
he
brought
his
face
so
close
to
hers
that
his
black
eyes
seemed
to
fill
the
world
you
can
not
lie
to
me
redbird
i
see
what
you
are
doing
you
are
going
to
no
no
i
am
looking
for
herbs
what
is
with
his
free
hand
he
tore
away
the
blanket
roll
she
had
tied
to
her
back
and
threw
it
into
the
snow
and
he
jerked
on
the
water
skin
so
hard
that
the
strap
broke
and
he
threw
that
down
too
do
you
need
those
things
to
help
you
find
herbs
he
shouted
trembling
from
head
to
foot
she
felt
herself
starting
to
cry
she
hated
herself
for
showing
such
weakness
in
front
of
wolf
paw
if
she
was
to
die
she
wanted
to
be
strong
to
her
surprise
the
sense
that
she
was
being
watched
from
a
distance
came
back
again
there
was
someone
else
out
here
in
the
frozen
darkness
besides
herself
and
wolf
paw
it
is
death
to
interfere
with
a
spirit
quest
wolf
paw
growled
the
shaman
daughter
of
all
people
should
know
better
than
to
break
a
holy
law
her
fear
made
her
feel
as
cold
as
breathless
as
if
she
were
already
plunged
into
black
freezing
water
swept
along
an
enormous
weight
of
ice
between
her
and
the
air
i
have
done
nothing
you
meant
to
that
is
as
bad
she
saw
the
hunting
knife
at
wolf
paw
belt
she
could
make
a
grab
for
it
try
to
stab
him
no
he
was
one
of
the
tribe
mightiest
braves
he
would
be
too
quick
and
strong
for
her
and
at
least
up
to
now
she
had
done
no
harm
to
anyone
but
herself
to
try
to
murder
the
son
of
the
war
leader
would
be
a
great
crime
his
grip
on
her
arm
still
cruelly
tight
he
gestured
back
behind
him
toward
the
camp
think
of
your
mother
weeping
over
what
i
caught
you
doing
your
father
his
heart
torn
in
his
chest
but
he
the
shaman
would
have
to
say
that
you
must
be
killed
hopelessness
crushed
her
now
she
would
never
be
able
to
help
gray
cloud
he
was
going
to
die
and
she
was
caught
by
wolf
paw
and
would
be
dishonored
before
the
whole
tribe
and
then
killed
she
hung
her
head
but
it
is
true
redbird
you
have
done
nothing
wolf
paw
said
more
softly
i
am
the
only
one
who
knows
that
you
were
about
to
break
the
law
woman
knows
but
wolf
paw
will
never
learn
that
from
i
do
not
want
you
to
die
redbird
said
the
low
voice
from
the
figure
towering
over
her
she
looked
up
at
him
was
he
going
to
be
merciful
he
said
it
makes
me
angry
that
you
throw
your
life
away
for
that
fatherless
pale
eyes
boy
to
wed
the
son
of
black
hawk
would
bring
you
honor
she
understood
now
he
was
going
to
offer
to
spare
her
life
if
she
would
marry
him
and
give
up
gray
cloud
he
did
not
understand
that
she
would
rather
be
dead
twice
over
than
spend
her
life
mourning
gray
cloud
and
married
to
wolf
paw
she
was
about
to
tell
him
so
when
she
heard
a
rumble
almost
like
thunder
from
the
trees
nearer
the
camp
with
much
whinnying
and
cracking
of
shrubbery
all
the
band
horses
burst
out
of
the
woods
and
ran
floundering
and
kicking
up
clouds
of
snow
out
on
the
prairie
be
still
wolf
paw
cautioned
in
a
low
voice
until
we
see
what
frightened
them
he
stood
with
his
head
high
listening
whatever
it
was
she
was
grateful
that
it
had
taken
wolf
paw
mind
off
her
she
heard
a
crashing
in
the
forest
branches
breaking
snow
crunching
something
large
was
coming
toward
them
she
turned
through
the
trees
she
saw
a
bulky
hunched
figure
it
seemed
to
be
a
large
animal
but
it
was
walking
on
its
hind
legs
it
came
forward
slowly
a
step
at
a
time
its
forelimbs
swung
at
its
sides
it
was
a
little
taller
than
a
man
it
looked
very
much
like
a
bear
a
new
fear
greater
than
the
fear
of
what
wolf
paw
might
do
assailed
her
a
bear
in
coldest
winter
when
all
of
that
people
withdrew
to
their
dens
and
slept
once
in
a
while
she
had
heard
a
very
hungry
bear
would
awaken
and
forage
for
food
and
then
go
back
to
sleep
again
such
a
bear
would
kill
anything
it
met
she
tensed
herself
to
run
though
she
knew
she
could
never
outrun
a
hungry
bear
the
shambling
tread
of
the
bear
or
whatever
it
was
had
brought
it
closer
and
she
saw
that
it
was
all
white
glittering
in
the
moonlight
like
a
snowdrift
she
glanced
at
wolf
paw
and
saw
his
eyes
glisten
as
they
widened
the
look
on
his
shadowed
face
was
one
she
never
thought
to
see
on
him
fear
he
sucked
in
a
shuddering
breath
the
hand
that
had
held
her
arm
suddenly
released
her
no
wonder
wolf
paw
was
afraid
this
was
a
white
bear
a
spirit
bear
its
eyes
reflecting
the
moonlight
seemed
to
glow
wolf
paw
uttered
a
terrified
inarticulate
cry
she
turned
to
see
him
racing
over
the
snow
were
she
not
so
frightened
herself
she
might
have
laughed
to
see
how
his
knees
flew
up
first
one
then
the
other
as
white
clouds
sprayed
from
his
snowshoes
strong
as
he
was
he
could
never
outrun
a
bear
especially
not
this
bear
as
for
herself
she
was
surely
doomed
she
thought
this
be
a
better
death
than
drowning
under
the
and
she
turned
to
face
the
spirit
bear
claw
marks
the
white
bear
was
out
of
the
forest
now
redbird
had
seen
bears
run
and
she
knew
it
could
cover
the
distance
that
separated
them
in
a
few
bounds
it
did
not
seem
to
be
looking
at
her
and
she
wondered
if
it
saw
her
it
sparkled
in
the
moonlight
its
breath
came
in
huge
frosty
clouds
obscuring
its
head
did
spirit
bears
breathe
she
looked
around
again
to
see
where
wolf
paw
was
he
had
become
a
small
dark
spot
against
the
white
at
the
edge
of
the
village
his
snowshoes
had
carried
him
far
quickly
she
too
would
have
run
if
she
could
run
like
wolf
paw
she
did
not
think
wolf
paw
a
coward
his
courage
was
well
known
facing
a
being
like
this
the
bravest
man
in
the
world
would
run
does
seem
to
see
me
maybe
it
is
best
to
stand
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
unable
to
decide
what
to
do
she
felt
dizzy
as
if
she
might
collapse
into
the
snow
the
bright
light
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
bear
dazzled
her
but
would
a
spirit
bear
attack
people
in
the
night
and
kill
them
devils
and
cannibal
giants
would
but
she
had
never
heard
of
a
spirit
doing
any
such
thing
she
was
learning
to
be
a
medicine
woman
and
a
medicine
woman
must
deal
unafraid
with
the
beings
of
the
other
world
talk
the
bad
spirits
out
of
a
sick
person
body
and
call
upon
the
good
spirits
to
aid
in
healing
she
took
a
deep
breath
whether
this
be
a
good
spirit
or
a
devil
she
would
stand
here
holding
herself
proudly
wolf
paw
if
he
looked
back
would
see
the
maiden
he
had
threatened
standing
in
the
place
he
had
run
from
the
white
bear
took
a
step
toward
her
in
spite
of
her
fear
she
made
herself
look
at
the
spirit
as
it
came
on
it
walked
so
slowly
perhaps
after
all
she
could
run
away
from
it
under
the
pointed
snout
she
saw
eyes
that
seemed
to
glow
out
of
a
shadowed
face
it
was
a
man
she
was
facing
she
saw
that
its
path
was
taking
it
past
her
it
he
did
not
seem
to
see
her
at
all
but
he
was
close
enough
now
for
her
to
see
the
face
under
the
bear
skull
the
large
round
eyes
the
long
thin
features
ending
in
a
pointed
chin
the
bony
beak
of
a
nose
the
tender
mouth
his
face
was
covered
with
a
mask
of
frost
gray
cloud
how
could
she
have
forgotten
that
when
he
walked
out
of
the
camp
yesterday
he
had
worn
a
black
bear
skin
draped
over
his
arms
and
shoulders
snow
and
frost
had
turned
the
fur
white
the
night
and
her
terror
had
tricked
her
into
thinking
she
saw
a
white
bear
spirit
wolf
paw
the
seasoned
warrior
had
been
tricked
and
terrified
too
gray
cloud
was
alive
a
scream
tried
to
force
its
way
out
of
her
chest
but
her
windpipe
was
so
tight
that
all
she
managed
was
a
gasp
joy
blazed
up
in
her
like
a
summer
campfire
but
no
he
could
not
be
alive
and
look
like
that
what
she
was
seeing
must
be
the
ghost
of
gray
cloud
or
his
dead
body
walking
the
cold
and
snow
had
killed
him
there
in
the
sacred
cave
and
this
shuffling
frozen
husk
was
all
that
was
left
of
him
gray
cloud
she
whispered
unable
to
speak
aloud
talk
to
me
if
he
walked
right
past
her
without
seeing
her
he
must
be
still
on
his
spirit
journey
she
had
always
heard
that
the
bodies
of
men
on
a
spirit
journey
remained
motionless
sitting
or
lying
down
but
she
was
certain
that
gray
cloud
was
not
fully
awake
she
stood
staring
at
him
her
mouth
open
as
he
shambled
on
past
her
she
slowly
turned
to
follow
him
and
now
she
was
facing
into
the
moonlight
and
seeing
the
shadows
of
the
wickiups
he
was
walking
in
that
frighteningly
slow
measured
way
toward
the
village
wolf
paw
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
feeling
came
to
her
again
of
other
eyes
upon
her
besides
wolf
paw
besides
the
strange
creature
gray
cloud
had
become
someone
else
seemed
to
be
out
here
in
the
field
with
her
she
shuddered
she
looked
around
to
see
if
she
could
guess
where
the
secret
watcher
might
be
hiding
someone
might
be
crouching
behind
one
of
the
long
snowdrifts
that
rippled
across
the
prairie
like
waves
on
a
lake
or
in
the
trees
by
the
river
she
must
not
let
herself
be
caught
out
here
she
picked
up
the
blanket
roll
and
water
skin
that
wolf
paw
had
thrown
into
the
snow
and
padded
on
her
snowshoes
after
the
lumbering
white
figure
she
must
hurry
and
try
to
get
to
a
place
where
her
presence
would
be
unnoticed
or
if
noticed
not
questioned
her
legs
ached
she
did
not
have
the
strength
to
run
gray
cloud
had
left
a
trail
of
two
shallow
furrows
in
the
snow
where
he
had
pushed
his
legs
through
and
the
snow
had
fallen
in
behind
him
on
her
snowshoes
she
pressed
on
behind
him
even
though
the
snowshoes
helped
her
her
legs
ached
she
wanted
to
throw
down
her
burdens
of
blanket
roll
and
water
skin
but
they
were
too
valuable
for
her
to
let
them
be
lost
out
here
merciless
pain
shot
up
from
her
shins
through
her
knees
to
her
hips
still
the
miseries
felt
by
her
body
could
not
touch
the
joy
of
her
spirit
gray
cloud
lived
a
wall
of
fur
coated
with
white
snow
loomed
up
before
her
as
gray
cloud
lumbered
along
she
quickly
stepped
to
the
side
and
hurried
around
him
she
turned
for
a
closer
look
at
him
his
steaming
breath
obscured
his
face
he
stopped
he
swayed
and
the
bear
skull
fell
back
from
his
lolling
head
she
screamed
a
sound
that
rang
distantly
in
her
ears
gray
cloud
dropped
to
his
knees
then
fell
forward
on
his
face
sending
up
a
great
puff
of
powdery
snow
that
glittered
in
the
moonlit
air
the
silence
after
his
fall
was
as
stunning
as
thunder
redbird
felt
tears
stream
from
her
eyes
and
freeze
at
once
on
her
cheeks
that
he
should
have
lived
through
two
nights
of
blizzard
and
cold
that
he
should
come
down
alive
from
the
sacred
cave
only
to
die
within
sight
of
the
village
under
her
very
eyes
was
more
than
she
could
stand
oh
no
she
whispered
he
must
not
die
she
fell
to
her
knees
beside
him
he
lay
face
down
half
buried
she
put
her
hands
under
his
shoulder
and
pushed
to
raise
his
head
he
was
heavy
but
her
fear
and
her
love
for
him
made
her
strong
enough
to
move
him
she
lifted
his
upper
body
and
turned
him
on
his
side
and
she
saw
the
beloved
features
hope
made
her
heart
beat
faster
as
little
clouds
of
warm
air
puffed
from
his
nostrils
but
his
breathing
was
ragged
and
shallow
she
had
to
get
him
in
out
of
the
cold
gasping
with
the
effort
she
rolled
him
over
on
his
back
she
would
have
to
try
to
drag
him
to
the
village
sobbing
with
she
sat
by
his
head
shoved
her
hands
under
his
shoulders
and
tried
to
stand
pulling
him
up
with
her
all
at
once
there
was
no
weight
on
her
arms
someone
else
was
there
lifting
gray
cloud
she
looked
up
thankful
yet
afraid
she
might
see
wolf
paw
returned
to
do
them
harm
no
it
was
iron
knife
seeing
the
broad
face
of
her
half
brother
a
cry
of
relief
burst
from
her
throat
oh
iron
knife
it
is
so
good
you
are
here
he
smiled
grimly
grunting
as
he
hauled
gray
cloud
to
his
feet
gray
cloud
eyes
were
shut
his
mouth
hanging
open
lucky
for
wolf
paw
that
gray
cloud
came
when
he
did
iron
knife
said
i
was
getting
an
arrow
ready
for
wolf
paw
he
jerked
his
head
at
the
bow
slung
over
his
shoulder
even
the
son
of
black
hawk
she
vividly
remembered
wolf
paw
threats
but
the
thought
of
iron
knife
murdering
him
horrified
her
do
you
think
i
let
him
drown
my
sister
iron
knife
put
an
arm
around
gray
cloud
shoulders
bent
down
and
picked
him
up
under
the
knees
bearskin
cloak
and
all
blowing
a
cloud
of
steam
out
of
his
mouth
he
straightened
cradling
gray
cloud
in
his
arms
though
gray
cloud
was
nearly
as
tall
as
iron
knife
he
was
much
lighter
it
was
iron
knife
she
realized
whose
eyes
she
had
felt
on
her
after
wolf
paw
ran
away
they
started
off
for
the
camp
she
heard
the
voices
of
men
and
women
raised
calling
to
one
another
wolf
paw
must
have
given
the
alarm
how
did
you
know
i
was
out
here
she
asked
you
were
sleeping
when
i
left
the
wickiup
father
woke
me
iron
knife
said
striding
stolidly
along
his
outer
moccasins
of
buffalo
hide
breaking
through
the
snow
he
knew
what
you
were
going
to
do
he
told
me
to
go
after
you
to
see
you
came
to
no
harm
as
they
plowed
steadily
onward
redbird
saw
figures
moving
about
in
the
village
they
must
be
terribly
sleepy
she
thought
dawn
was
still
a
long
way
off
still
more
and
more
people
were
running
back
and
forth
among
the
wickiups
they
were
crowding
in
this
direction
coming
to
meet
gray
cloud
and
iron
knife
and
redbird
a
mass
of
people
dark
against
the
moonlit
snow
in
the
front
rank
walked
owl
carver
himself
the
sacred
necklace
of
megis
shells
swung
on
his
chest
in
one
hand
he
held
his
medicine
stick
a
cedar
staff
decorated
with
feathers
and
beads
topped
with
the
carved
head
of
an
owl
his
long
white
hair
spread
out
over
his
shoulders
she
could
hear
a
murmuring
of
voices
and
above
them
the
shaman
her
father
singing
let
the
people
welcome
him
he
has
walked
the
spirit
trail
he
comes
back
from
the
sky
from
the
water
from
under
the
earth
he
comes
back
from
the
seven
directions
let
the
people
welcome
him
owl
carver
was
dancing
as
he
approached
them
a
slow
heavy
shuffle
alternating
with
sidesteps
his
upper
body
rising
and
falling
his
hands
one
holding
his
medicine
stick
the
other
a
yellow
and
red
gourd
rattle
were
lifted
high
over
his
head
the
necklace
of
small
black
and
white
shells
bounced
on
his
chest
iron
knife
carrying
gray
cloud
came
to
a
stop
before
owl
carver
redbird
not
wanting
people
to
know
how
she
cared
for
gray
cloud
drew
away
from
iron
knife
and
tried
to
melt
into
the
crowd
taking
a
few
more
steps
owl
carver
placed
himself
facing
east
with
iron
knife
and
gray
cloud
on
his
right
he
danced
in
a
sunwise
circle
around
them
from
east
to
south
to
west
to
north
bobbing
his
head
and
singing
the
great
wise
one
has
sent
him
he
has
walked
the
spirit
trail
he
brings
wisdom
from
the
sky
from
the
water
from
under
the
earth
he
comes
back
from
the
seven
directions
the
great
wise
one
has
sent
him
nine
times
owl
carver
danced
around
gray
cloud
and
iron
knife
in
the
circle
that
represented
the
sun
the
horizon
and
the
cycles
of
life
and
the
seasons
then
in
his
normal
voice
not
breaking
step
he
said
bring
him
to
my
medicine
wickiup
he
turned
abruptly
and
danced
through
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
the
people
parted
to
let
him
through
and
they
stared
at
gray
cloud
body
in
iron
knife
arms
the
people
who
had
followed
owl
carver
had
stamped
down
a
path
through
the
village
no
longer
needing
sun
woman
snowshoes
redbird
bent
and
unstrapped
them
from
her
feet
she
was
suddenly
so
exhausted
by
her
efforts
and
by
the
fear
and
sleeplessness
of
two
days
that
she
could
hardly
stumble
along
behind
iron
knife
she
felt
that
at
any
moment
she
might
faint
the
light
of
the
full
moon
shining
down
from
directly
overhead
and
reflecting
on
the
snow
seemed
to
make
the
whole
village
almost
as
bright
as
day
sighing
redbird
looked
up
and
saw
wolf
paw
staring
at
her
from
beside
the
path
his
black
eyes
pierced
her
like
arrowheads
under
his
sharp
nose
his
mouth
was
tight
she
nodded
her
head
at
him
hoping
he
would
understand
that
she
was
saying
that
they
should
keep
each
other
secrets
redbird
a
hand
seized
her
arm
roughly
and
pain
shot
through
up
to
her
shoulder
her
mother
wind
bends
grass
glared
at
her
furiously
why
did
you
leave
our
wickiup
redbird
felt
that
if
she
stopped
walking
to
talk
she
would
never
be
able
to
move
again
she
pulled
her
arm
free
her
sisters
clinging
to
either
side
of
her
mother
stared
up
at
her
as
if
she
herself
had
returned
from
a
spirit
journey
her
mother
walked
beside
her
scolding
her
in
a
shrill
voice
but
her
words
meant
nothing
to
redbird
she
only
wanted
to
see
gray
cloud
brought
safely
to
the
shaman
wickiup
someone
else
took
her
arm
squeezing
it
gently
and
she
looked
up
into
sun
woman
face
tears
streaked
the
strong
cheekbones
you
saved
his
life
sun
woman
said
so
softly
only
redbird
could
hear
the
words
i
did
nothing
redbird
protested
silently
sun
woman
took
the
snowshoes
the
water
bag
and
the
blanket
roll
from
her
owl
carver
stopped
at
the
doorway
of
the
medicine
wickiup
he
danced
from
one
foot
to
the
other
shaking
his
staff
he
nodded
at
iron
knife
and
motioned
him
to
carry
gray
cloud
into
the
dark
interior
redbird
followed
the
stick
barred
her
way
go
with
your
mother
owl
carver
said
softly
you
have
done
enough
this
night
she
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
praising
or
reproaching
her
he
live
she
wanted
to
ask
but
his
solemn
face
forbade
her
to
speak
she
turned
away
from
his
remoteness
and
faced
her
mother
anger
her
heart
was
still
full
of
terror
for
gray
cloud
but
she
knew
that
the
instant
she
lay
down
she
would
fall
into
an
exhausted
sleep
it
seemed
that
no
time
had
passed
when
wind
bends
grass
shook
her
awake
your
father
calls
the
people
together
she
said
in
a
voice
still
hard
with
anger
redbird
eyelids
felt
as
if
they
were
made
of
stone
she
forced
herself
to
sit
up
and
then
with
immense
effort
got
to
her
feet
she
was
still
fully
dressed
even
in
her
fur
cloak
and
mittens
she
had
collapsed
in
the
wickiup
without
removing
anything
the
wickiup
was
now
empty
her
mother
and
her
sisters
had
gone
ahead
without
her
her
heart
hammered
in
her
chest
owl
carver
might
be
calling
the
people
to
tell
them
that
gray
cloud
was
dead
outside
the
air
was
still
deathly
cold
but
the
sun
was
a
bright
yellow
disk
rising
above
the
distant
gray
line
of
trees
that
marked
the
bluffs
overlooking
the
great
river
the
light
made
her
blink
and
she
turned
away
from
it
she
stumbled
in
the
direction
all
the
other
people
were
going
to
the
medicine
wickiup
in
the
center
of
the
camp
circle
she
found
that
the
open
area
before
the
wickiup
was
crowded
and
she
could
not
get
close
the
spaces
between
nearby
wickiups
were
also
filled
with
people
all
waiting
for
owl
carver
to
speak
she
seated
herself
between
two
women
both
of
whom
had
small
children
on
their
laps
redbird
knew
one
of
the
mothers
water
flows
fast
a
stout
woman
with
a
round
cheerful
face
and
shrewd
eyes
water
flows
fast
said
you
are
the
daughter
of
owl
carver
you
should
go
up
and
sit
close
to
him
redbird
sliced
her
hand
flat
across
her
body
to
say
no
she
knew
water
flows
fast
to
be
a
keen
observer
and
a
gossip
always
looking
for
signs
of
trouble
in
other
people
families
the
less
redbird
said
to
her
the
better
redbird
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
saw
that
now
there
were
many
more
people
packed
in
behind
her
everyone
was
talking
at
once
and
the
hundreds
of
voices
beating
upon
her
ears
made
her
head
hurt
about
five
hundred
people
were
here
everyone
in
this
camp
which
was
one
of
four
that
made
up
the
british
band
of
the
sauk
and
fox
tribes
that
would
come
together
in
saukenuk
after
the
winter
snow
and
ice
melted
the
medicine
wickiup
was
built
on
a
low
hill
in
the
center
of
the
camp
and
when
owl
carver
appeared
everyone
who
was
standing
sat
down
redbird
eyes
devoured
owl
carver
face
trying
to
read
in
it
whether
gray
cloud
was
alive
or
dead
another
man
emerged
from
the
medicine
wickiup
to
stand
beside
owl
carver
his
head
was
bare
even
on
this
terribly
cold
day
and
he
wore
his
hair
in
the
manner
of
a
brave
his
dark
brown
scalp
shaved
except
for
a
long
black
scalplock
that
coiled
down
the
side
of
his
face
his
eyes
were
shadowed
and
and
there
were
heavy
pouches
under
them
his
cheekbones
jutted
out
and
his
mouth
was
wide
curving
down
at
the
corners
where
it
met
deep
furrows
that
ran
from
nose
to
chin
redbird
heart
beat
faster
as
she
saw
that
to
honor
this
moment
he
had
attached
a
string
of
eagle
feathers
to
his
scalplock
and
wore
strings
of
small
white
beads
around
the
rim
of
each
ear
he
stood
with
his
arms
folded
under
a
buffalo
robe
skin
side
out
painted
with
a
red
hand
proclaiming
that
he
had
killed
and
scalped
his
first
enemy
while
still
a
boy
his
sombre
gaze
fell
upon
redbird
like
a
stone
striking
her
from
a
great
height
she
felt
as
if
the
war
chief
of
the
british
band
knew
every
one
of
her
secrets
she
ducked
her
head
and
looked
down
at
her
mittened
hands
in
her
lap
owl
carver
raised
his
arms
and
the
people
fell
silent
i
have
called
on
black
hawk
our
war
chief
to
see
gray
cloud
and
he
has
heard
great
prophecies
from
gray
cloud
lips
the
shaman
cried
in
a
high
chanting
voice
then
gray
cloud
had
lived
through
the
night
owl
carver
blurred
in
redbird
sight
and
if
she
had
not
already
been
seated
she
might
have
collapsed
relief
made
her
heart
swell
up
in
her
chest
feeling
as
if
it
might
burst
the
people
around
her
murmured
in
surprise
pleasure
and
curiosity
the
shaman
stretched
out
his
hand
sun
woman
stand
before
the
people
nothing
happened
for
a
long
moment
then
owl
carver
beckoned
insistently
there
was
another
silence
then
black
hawk
hand
emerged
from
under
his
buffalo
mantle
and
he
crooked
his
finger
a
tall
woman
wrapped
in
a
buffalo
robe
rose
from
among
the
seated
people
people
sighed
happily
and
called
out
a
welcome
to
her
sun
woman
turned
to
face
the
crowd
to
redbird
she
seemed
calm
and
unruffled
even
though
she
had
hesitated
about
standing
up
this
woman
brought
her
son
to
me
and
asked
me
to
train
him
as
a
shaman
owl
carver
declared
i
did
not
want
to
because
he
is
not
a
pure
sauk
she
said
to
me
only
try
him
for
a
little
time
and
see
what
he
can
be
i
tried
him
for
a
little
time
and
i
saw
something
in
him
i
saw
sleeping
powers
the
people
murmured
in
wonder
water
flows
fast
and
the
woman
with
her
whispered
to
each
other
darting
curious
glances
at
redbird
who
carefully
kept
her
face
as
impassive
as
sun
woman
i
tested
him
and
saw
that
his
dreams
could
foretell
the
future
that
he
could
send
his
spirit
walking
while
his
body
lay
still
that
he
could
talk
to
the
spirits
in
trees
and
birds
i
saw
that
he
had
the
power
to
be
a
shaman
and
more
owl
carver
paused
and
stared
at
them
fiercely
and
so
i
sent
him
up
to
the
sacred
cave
knowing
that
he
might
meet
spirits
so
powerful
that
to
encounter
them
destroys
the
souls
of
men
and
gray
cloud
went
into
the
sacred
cave
and
he
met
the
great
spirits
and
he
journeyed
with
them
owl
carver
cried
people
gasped
he
has
met
the
white
bear
he
has
spoken
with
the
turtle
father
of
the
great
river
he
has
brought
back
a
message
for
black
hawk
said
owl
carver
the
turtle
told
gray
cloud
that
black
hawk
might
tell
others
as
he
saw
fit
the
rumble
of
voices
rose
at
this
and
then
quieted
as
owl
carver
raised
his
medicine
stick
after
the
turtle
created
our
mother
the
earth
he
mated
with
her
and
all
tribes
were
born
in
her
womb
owl
carver
said
they
lived
there
in
a
warm
darkness
but
they
had
to
go
forth
and
find
their
way
out
of
our
mother
then
there
came
to
our
ancestors
an
elder
spirit
the
white
bear
who
led
them
out
the
womb
of
our
mother
when
they
were
in
the
light
they
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
ring
of
fiery
mountains
our
people
are
called
osaukawug
or
sauk
the
people
of
the
place
of
fire
because
that
fiery
place
is
where
we
first
walked
in
the
world
there
was
nothing
to
eat
there
was
nothing
around
the
people
but
stones
and
fire
and
they
were
hungry
and
greatly
afraid
and
they
were
angry
at
the
white
bear
for
leading
them
out
of
our
mother
to
this
place
but
the
white
bear
showed
them
a
way
through
the
fiery
mountains
and
over
many
fields
of
snow
and
ice
until
he
brought
our
ancestors
to
this
good
land
where
there
is
fish
and
game
where
the
grasslands
are
green
and
the
woods
are
full
of
berries
and
fruit
and
our
friends
the
fox
the
yellow
earth
people
came
to
be
our
allies
and
to
unite
with
us
and
the
turtle
opened
his
heart
and
the
great
river
flowed
forth
our
ancestors
hunted
and
fished
in
the
land
where
the
rock
river
flows
into
the
great
river
on
the
rock
river
they
built
our
village
of
saukenuk
where
they
would
dwell
in
the
summer
and
their
women
would
grow
the
three
sisters
corn
beans
and
squash
in
the
fields
around
the
village
and
there
at
saukenuk
as
our
ancestors
died
they
were
buried
the
white
bear
told
us
we
should
spend
our
summers
in
that
land
east
of
the
great
river
in
the
winter
it
should
be
our
custom
to
cross
to
the
west
of
the
great
river
and
hunt
here
in
the
ioway
country
and
here
by
the
great
river
we
sauk
the
people
of
the
place
of
fire
have
lived
ever
since
redbird
felt
warmth
on
her
back
through
her
buffalo
robe
the
sun
had
risen
higher
owl
carver
called
out
in
his
high
voice
of
prophecy
the
white
bear
has
come
again
he
has
led
gray
cloud
on
his
spirit
journey
now
gray
cloud
is
a
true
shaman
he
still
must
be
trained
to
use
his
powers
but
his
powers
no
longer
sleep
and
in
sign
that
he
is
a
shaman
with
another
self
he
shall
have
a
new
name
let
him
be
known
to
all
the
people
as
white
bear
redbird
heard
cries
of
assent
from
the
people
around
her
owl
carver
crossed
his
arms
before
his
chest
to
show
that
he
was
finished
speaking
and
turned
to
black
hawk
so
let
it
be
said
black
hawk
in
his
harsh
grating
voice
earthmaker
has
willed
that
the
british
band
shall
be
blessed
with
a
mighty
new
spirit
walker
let
his
name
hereafter
be
white
bear
i
could
make
a
spirit
redbird
thought
too
could
stand
before
the
people
and
advise
she
came
to
a
sudden
resolve
day
i
now
you
shall
see
our
new
shaman
owl
carver
declared
he
stepped
back
and
pulled
aside
the
curtain
that
covered
the
door
of
his
wickiup
a
tall
young
man
came
out
stooping
to
pass
through
the
doorway
and
then
standing
straight
before
the
people
redbird
heart
beat
faster
and
she
half
rose
to
her
feet
his
slender
body
despite
the
cold
was
bare
to
the
waist
redbird
gasped
as
she
saw
what
was
on
his
chest
five
long
deep
scratches
side
by
side
the
blood
had
dried
and
turned
black
five
long
black
marks
down
the
middle
of
his
pale
chest
running
almost
from
the
base
of
his
neck
to
the
bottom
of
his
rib
cage
cries
of
awe
and
wonder
arose
from
the
people
they
had
all
seen
such
marks
sometimes
scratched
in
the
bark
of
trees
sometimes
on
the
bodies
of
animals
found
in
the
forest
in
summer
the
claw
marks
of
a
bear
and
now
his
name
was
white
bear
she
whispered
it
to
herself
her
eyes
saw
nothing
but
the
shining
slender
form
and
her
ears
heard
nothing
but
the
sound
of
his
name
master
of
victoire
raoul
threw
himself
into
the
lake
the
giant
potawatomi
chief
black
salmon
roaring
behind
him
the
water
resisted
his
legs
like
molasses
black
salmon
seized
raoul
neck
cutting
off
his
breath
strangling
he
was
helpless
as
the
potawatomi
dragged
him
back
to
shore
the
huge
indian
whip
tore
into
raoul
back
raoul
felt
the
skin
ripping
and
the
blood
running
he
was
nothing
but
a
helpless
lump
of
bleeding
flesh
paralyzed
with
pain
other
potawatomi
had
torn
helene
clothes
off
the
warriors
danced
around
her
on
the
beach
as
she
cowered
white
skin
shining
blond
hair
trying
to
cover
herself
the
indian
bucks
were
naked
too
and
flaunted
their
erect
purple
cocks
big
as
war
clubs
one
of
them
darted
into
the
circle
and
bit
a
piece
out
of
poor
helene
shoulder
bright
red
blood
flowed
down
her
arm
raoul
ran
to
save
his
sister
he
broke
away
from
black
salmon
and
fought
his
way
through
the
potawatomi
warriors
around
her
she
lay
on
her
back
on
the
sand
twisting
her
body
from
side
to
side
in
pain
hideous
bite
wounds
all
over
her
body
lay
open
like
red
mouths
silently
screaming
one
breast
was
covered
with
blood
the
indians
fell
upon
raoul
they
had
their
scalping
knives
out
and
they
threw
him
down
on
the
ground
beside
helene
black
salmon
caught
up
with
him
and
whipped
him
till
every
inch
of
his
body
was
slashed
the
redskins
tore
away
the
last
few
rags
of
raoul
clothing
a
circle
of
grimacing
dark
faces
painted
with
yellow
and
black
stripes
closed
in
on
him
they
bared
sharp
teeth
like
snarling
dogs
they
were
going
to
eat
him
alive
raoul
father
and
raoul
brother
pierre
faces
marble
and
calm
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
indians
they
looked
down
at
raoul
agony
just
curious
raoul
tried
to
cry
out
papa
pierre
help
us
they
killing
us
no
sound
came
out
of
his
mouth
but
a
useless
little
wheeze
he
had
lost
his
voice
you
should
not
have
angered
them
papa
said
one
of
the
savages
holding
high
a
long
thin
skinning
knife
seized
raoul
balls
he
brought
the
knife
down
slowly
raoul
kept
trying
to
scream
at
his
father
and
brother
again
and
again
he
forced
air
through
his
aching
throat
nothing
came
but
a
silly
squeak
then
a
groan
a
little
louder
pierre
reached
out
a
marble
hand
to
him
thank
god
just
as
their
fingers
touched
pierre
jerked
his
hand
away
and
disappeared
raoul
felt
the
indian
blade
like
cold
fire
slicing
through
the
sac
between
his
legs
at
last
he
let
out
a
scream
raoul
his
body
cold
and
wet
with
sweat
he
sat
up
in
darkness
he
felt
arms
clutching
at
him
and
fought
them
off
raoul
wake
up
panting
he
said
his
name
in
his
mind
am
raoul
françois
philippe
charles
de
he
repeated
it
over
and
over
again
to
himself
he
was
sitting
in
bed
in
the
dark
someone
beside
him
not
an
indian
and
not
his
sister
helene
he
gasped
again
and
again
as
if
he
had
run
a
race
he
tried
to
pull
his
mind
together
his
heart
was
still
pounding
against
the
wall
of
his
chest
his
hands
trembling
his
skin
ice
cold
that
terrible
dream
he
had
had
it
in
a
year
or
more
lordy
what
a
nightmare
you
must
have
had
you
did
a
right
smart
of
hollerin
in
the
dim
light
seeping
in
through
cracks
in
the
shuttered
window
raoul
saw
a
woman
with
long
blond
hair
sitting
up
beside
him
staring
at
him
with
pale
blue
eyes
clarissa
clarissa
greenglove
he
looked
down
at
her
a
warmth
began
to
creep
back
into
his
body
rising
first
in
his
loins
as
he
remembered
what
they
had
done
together
the
night
before
five
times
no
six
never
before
had
he
done
it
that
many
times
in
one
night
he
was
still
panting
in
the
aftermath
of
the
horror
but
the
sight
of
her
naked
body
was
helping
him
get
the
dream
out
of
his
mind
never
done
it
with
such
a
woman
she
looked
down
at
herself
and
drew
up
the
sheet
to
cover
her
breasts
do
do
that
he
said
and
pulled
the
sheet
down
again
none
too
gently
he
began
to
rub
her
breast
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
feeling
the
nipple
get
bigger
and
harder
she
closed
her
eyes
and
gave
a
little
murmur
of
pleasure
how
she
enjoyed
it
last
night
she
sighed
and
groaned
and
whimpered
and
screamed
and
licked
him
and
bit
him
and
twisted
her
body
from
side
to
side
like
a
soul
in
perdition
her
frenzy
had
fired
him
up
like
never
before
no
wonder
he
been
able
to
mount
her
so
many
times
and
somewhere
near
the
end
of
it
all
she
sobbed
into
his
shoulder
for
what
seemed
like
an
hour
he
figured
that
was
a
tribute
to
what
he
had
done
to
her
the
sheets
were
still
damp
with
their
sweat
and
the
air
in
the
little
bedroom
was
thick
with
the
musky
odors
of
their
secret
juices
but
the
redskins
were
still
stalking
in
his
brain
and
he
was
still
a
little
frightened
he
did
want
to
sit
here
in
the
dark
light
a
candle
will
you
he
said
the
striker
on
that
table
she
hesitated
can
i
get
dressed
first
hell
no
he
laughed
what
difference
would
that
make
after
last
night
i
know
you
outside
and
in
clarissa
she
giggled
and
got
out
of
bed
while
he
sat
hugging
his
knees
watching
her
it
cold
out
here
she
whined
well
hurry
and
get
that
candle
lit
and
get
back
in
bed
the
march
air
whistled
in
through
chinks
in
the
log
walls
and
shutters
and
even
though
the
inn
chimney
ran
up
through
this
room
it
did
seem
to
help
he
guessed
that
downstairs
in
the
taproom
someone
had
let
the
fire
die
clarissa
pale
rounded
shape
as
she
moved
through
the
shadows
made
him
feel
stronger
by
the
moment
the
women
he
had
up
to
now
many
of
them
right
here
in
this
bed
had
been
older
and
and
he
enjoyed
the
look
of
their
bodies
that
much
clarissa
was
just
the
right
age
old
enough
to
be
filled
out
young
enough
to
be
slender
and
firm
he
guessed
she
must
be
sixteen
or
seventeen
raoul
had
been
bedding
women
since
he
was
sixteen
for
seven
years
now
and
he
never
had
a
better
night
than
this
last
one
with
clarissa
then
why
after
such
a
shining
night
did
he
have
dream
as
the
cotton
ball
flared
up
and
clarissa
held
a
candlewick
to
the
flame
the
nightmare
came
back
to
him
and
out
of
the
roiling
images
of
red
limbs
and
painted
faces
and
blood
and
torn
white
bodies
he
dragged
the
reason
for
what
he
had
dreamed
when
he
remembered
it
he
slumped
a
little
his
delight
in
waking
up
next
to
a
pretty
young
woman
wiped
away
he
heard
again
the
stunning
infuriating
words
that
had
tumbled
out
of
armand
perrault
bushy
brown
beard
overheard
your
brother
monsieur
pierre
talking
to
your
father
this
morning
he
spoke
of
how
he
has
always
felt
that
he
had
abandoned
his
sauk
indian
wife
and
their
son
when
he
came
back
here
and
married
madame
now
that
he
is
a
widower
he
says
he
wants
to
do
right
by
her
and
the
boy
this
thing
about
having
a
sauk
woman
and
a
son
pierre
had
never
said
anything
about
that
to
call
some
indian
whore
a
brother
the
master
of
victoire
a
father
of
a
mongrel
son
armand
had
remarked
sourly
to
raoul
it
seems
monsieur
pierre
is
a
great
one
for
doing
by
women
raoul
knew
what
he
meant
he
heard
the
rumor
that
after
had
died
pierre
a
little
crazy
in
his
grief
had
taken
armand
wife
to
bed
a
time
or
two
to
comfort
himself
but
that
was
nothing
compared
to
what
pierre
was
threatening
now
living
in
our
home
a
squaw
in
the
bed
where
pierre
slept
with
good
how
could
pierre
do
such
a
thing
after
what
the
indians
had
done
to
helene
after
raoul
had
spent
two
years
beaten
and
enslaved
by
black
salmon
how
could
papa
permit
it
clarissa
turned
holding
out
before
her
a
lighted
white
candle
in
a
little
pewter
dish
she
did
seem
so
shy
now
about
letting
him
see
her
naked
he
let
his
eyes
linger
over
her
breasts
narrow
waist
the
brown
puff
of
hair
where
her
long
legs
joined
her
wide
hips
he
often
felt
a
hankering
for
clarissa
since
he
hired
her
father
eli
greenglove
to
help
him
run
the
trading
post
but
he
thought
it
unwise
to
get
mixed
up
with
her
eli
was
a
dangerous
man
last
night
that
had
seemed
to
matter
after
armand
had
brought
him
the
bad
news
he
turned
to
kentucky
whiskey
old
kaintuck
and
to
clarissa
dancing
with
her
to
registre
bosquet
fiddle
in
the
taproom
to
take
his
mind
off
this
sudden
insult
pierre
had
flung
at
him
late
in
the
evening
he
stumbled
upstairs
behind
clarissa
to
his
bedroom
in
the
inn
his
hands
up
her
skirts
feeling
the
satiny
skin
of
her
legs
and
then
down
on
the
bed
and
whiskey
and
all
six
times
but
this
morning
his
pleasure
in
her
was
spoiled
by
this
treachery
of
pierre
a
squaw
and
a
redskinned
mongrel
raoul
would
want
indians
on
the
estate
even
as
servants
now
pierre
was
talking
about
these
savages
living
in
victoire
as
part
of
the
family
he
felt
a
sudden
stinging
bite
down
near
his
rear
end
under
the
covers
angrily
he
slapped
at
himself
damned
fleas
and
bedbugs
levi
pope
wife
made
a
job
of
laundering
the
bedding
for
the
inn
i
had
a
wife
i
make
sure
she
kept
the
bugs
out
of
my
clarissa
set
the
candle
down
on
the
table
and
climbed
back
into
bed
she
ran
her
hand
over
his
back
she
brought
her
face
close
to
his
and
he
decided
that
though
he
liked
her
arms
and
legs
and
hips
and
breasts
he
did
care
for
her
weak
chin
her
blond
hair
and
light
blue
eyes
and
the
brown
stain
on
one
of
her
front
teeth
she
said
you
got
scars
all
over
your
back
somebody
beat
you
your
paw
my
papa
the
thought
made
him
smile
no
the
old
man
not
that
sort
he
the
kind
of
man
who
might
forget
about
me
for
a
while
who
might
let
me
be
captured
by
indians
in
and
not
manage
to
find
me
and
ransom
me
till
kind
of
man
who
might
actually
let
my
brother
bring
indians
into
our
the
scars
the
scars
reminded
him
every
day
of
fort
dearborn
august
the
memories
left
scars
inside
memories
of
being
ten
years
old
cowering
in
an
indian
encampment
with
the
other
white
captives
from
fort
dearborn
while
the
warriors
with
their
clubs
and
tomahawks
approached
grinning
it
had
happened
the
way
he
dreamed
it
the
potawatomi
had
pulled
a
man
an
army
private
to
his
feet
while
he
begged
for
his
life
and
dragged
him
over
to
the
campfire
in
an
agony
of
terror
raoul
had
pressed
against
helene
seated
beside
him
on
the
ground
she
put
her
arm
around
his
shoulders
and
held
him
tight
his
sister
helene
had
seen
her
husband
throat
cut
and
his
scalp
slashed
away
that
very
morning
when
the
indians
fell
upon
the
retreating
soldiers
of
fort
dearborn
and
the
civilians
fleeing
the
tiny
village
called
checagou
but
somehow
helene
kept
herself
calm
and
strong
after
witnessing
henri
terrible
death
raoul
knew
it
was
for
his
sake
raoul
had
shut
his
eyes
and
heard
the
clubs
thud
into
the
head
and
body
of
the
soldier
at
the
campfire
heard
his
screams
heard
the
silence
of
death
when
the
screams
stopped
a
man
life
had
ended
just
like
that
raoul
trembled
hiding
his
face
in
helene
side
around
him
the
other
prisoners
men
and
women
sobbed
and
prayed
the
indians
took
another
soldier
they
tied
him
to
a
stake
and
cut
away
bits
of
his
flesh
with
the
sharpened
edges
of
clam
shells
they
worked
at
him
for
hours
until
he
bled
to
death
the
warriors
came
back
for
their
next
victim
sauntering
among
the
prisoners
eyes
aglow
painted
faces
like
masks
of
monsters
stinking
of
the
whiskey
they
been
drinking
all
night
this
time
he
was
sure
they
were
coming
for
him
but
they
took
helene
he
had
never
forgotten
her
last
words
to
him
spoken
serenely
as
the
potawatomi
seized
her
arms
i
am
going
to
join
henri
pray
to
the
mother
of
god
for
me
raoul
the
indians
dragged
helene
into
the
woods
they
took
another
woman
as
well
the
potawatomi
squaws
seated
around
a
nearby
campfire
chattered
among
themselves
they
laughed
whenever
one
of
the
women
in
the
woods
screamed
raoul
could
not
believe
that
any
of
those
sounds
were
coming
from
his
sister
throat
the
helpless
white
prisoners
covered
their
faces
and
prayed
and
wept
and
the
men
cursed
he
had
hated
himself
for
not
trying
to
help
helene
but
he
was
too
frightened
to
move
too
frightened
even
to
cry
out
brooding
about
it
now
nearly
thirteen
years
later
he
told
himself
once
again
that
if
he
tried
to
help
helene
the
indians
would
have
clubbed
him
to
death
he
told
himself
that
he
had
been
only
ten
years
old
that
did
not
make
any
difference
to
the
shame
he
felt
when
he
remembered
that
night
he
should
have
gone
to
her
he
should
have
fought
to
the
death
for
her
he
could
never
forgive
himself
did
we
all
fight
and
die
would
it
have
been
better
to
attack
the
indians
barehanded
and
be
killed
than
to
let
that
happen
but
neither
could
he
forgive
papa
and
pierre
his
father
and
brother
had
left
raoul
in
helene
care
at
fort
dearborn
where
her
husband
henri
vaillancourt
ran
the
trading
post
of
papa
illinois
fur
company
when
it
became
apparent
that
a
second
war
between
england
and
the
united
states
was
about
to
break
out
papa
declared
that
land
prices
in
illinois
were
now
as
low
as
they
would
ever
be
and
he
set
off
in
search
of
likely
land
to
buy
for
a
family
seat
pierre
had
gone
to
the
sauk
and
fox
indians
on
the
rock
river
to
talk
about
trade
and
land
purchases
with
them
raoul
had
been
happy
enough
to
be
left
with
helene
who
had
been
a
mother
to
him
as
far
back
as
he
could
remember
his
own
mother
helene
had
gently
explained
to
him
had
gone
to
heaven
when
he
was
born
when
raoul
heard
no
more
screams
from
the
woods
he
knew
helene
had
gone
to
heaven
too
the
next
morning
as
the
indians
began
the
march
back
to
their
village
dragging
their
bound
captives
raoul
had
seen
helene
naked
body
with
stab
wounds
in
a
hundred
places
lying
face
down
half
submerged
in
lake
michigan
surf
he
saw
a
round
red
patch
on
top
of
her
head
later
he
saw
a
brave
who
had
tied
to
his
belt
a
long
hank
of
hair
surely
helene
a
circular
piece
of
skin
dangling
down
the
indians
had
chosen
not
to
kill
raoul
perhaps
because
at
ten
he
was
too
young
to
be
a
satisfying
victim
but
old
enough
to
work
and
so
black
salmon
had
taken
him
for
his
slave
it
made
no
difference
whether
he
worked
well
or
poorly
black
salmon
let
not
a
day
go
by
without
whipping
him
and
fed
him
entrails
and
hominy
grits
only
after
raoul
had
endured
two
years
of
slavery
did
his
father
elysée
find
him
and
ransom
him
from
black
salmon
and
when
raoul
was
older
he
came
to
understand
the
full
horror
of
what
the
indians
had
done
to
helene
they
must
have
raped
her
over
and
over
again
and
he
hated
himself
and
pierre
and
elysée
all
the
more
for
letting
it
happen
but
most
of
all
he
hated
indians
indians
living
at
victoire
he
had
to
kill
that
notion
of
pierre
right
now
he
would
put
on
his
clothes
and
saddle
banner
and
ride
up
to
the
château
and
set
his
father
and
brother
straight
but
would
they
understand
pierre
with
his
conscience
who
had
lived
with
the
damned
sauk
and
fox
for
years
and
slept
with
one
of
their
dirty
squaws
elysée
buried
in
his
books
raoul
remembered
their
marble
faces
as
he
had
seen
them
in
his
dream
they
never
understood
him
where
did
you
get
them
scars
clarissa
asked
interrupting
his
thoughts
as
she
ran
her
fingers
lightly
over
the
hard
ridges
on
his
back
raoul
told
her
about
black
salmon
he
liked
whipping
me
even
better
than
he
liked
whiskey
and
when
he
got
hold
of
whiskey
he
liked
beating
me
even
better
poor
raoul
and
such
a
little
boy
clarissa
face
drew
down
with
sympathy
i
powerful
sorry
for
you
she
pulled
him
to
her
he
lowered
his
head
to
her
breast
and
drew
the
nipple
into
his
mouth
pressing
it
with
his
teeth
they
lay
back
together
and
he
enjoyed
the
feel
of
the
soft
mattress
and
pillows
billowing
up
around
them
by
god
if
he
did
feel
himself
getting
big
and
hard
to
do
it
again
proudly
he
threw
back
the
sheet
and
let
her
see
what
he
had
for
her
she
smiled
up
at
him
welcoming
her
pale
blue
eyes
shining
in
the
candlelight
he
could
use
her
to
help
him
forget
a
little
longer
about
pierre
and
his
redskin
wife
and
son
a
sharp
rapping
at
the
bedroom
door
brought
an
end
to
his
new
surge
of
desire
clarissa
gasped
and
pulled
away
from
raoul
dragging
the
bedclothes
toward
her
raoul
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
and
called
out
who
there
it
eli
said
a
voice
through
the
door
raoul
heart
began
hammering
again
as
hard
as
when
he
woke
from
his
nightmare
oh
lord
my
paw
whispered
clarissa
she
sounded
frightened
but
only
a
frightened
and
raoul
eyed
her
suspiciously
her
eyes
were
wide
like
a
child
trying
to
deny
mischief
after
being
caught
could
eli
and
his
daughter
have
planned
this
did
eli
know
that
clarissa
was
in
here
raoul
had
been
too
drunkenly
careless
to
worry
about
who
was
watching
when
he
took
her
upstairs
last
night
feeling
a
quaking
in
his
stomach
raoul
walked
over
to
the
door
what
eli
he
hoped
his
voice
sounded
strong
he
no
longer
took
pleasure
and
pride
in
his
nakedness
thought
you
should
know
about
something
i
heard
over
to
the
fur
store
raoul
who
minding
the
furs
now
the
place
was
full
of
bundles
of
pelts
beaver
badger
fox
raccoon
skunk
and
valuable
trade
goods
indian
bucks
walking
in
and
out
all
the
time
this
time
of
year
raoul
had
been
happy
to
turn
most
of
the
fur
trade
work
over
to
eli
he
stomach
dealing
with
indians
i
left
otto
wegner
there
raoul
there
injuns
out
digging
in
your
lead
mine
at
once
raoul
forgot
his
fear
of
being
caught
with
clarissa
in
its
place
he
felt
a
rage
so
powerful
his
body
seemed
to
fill
up
with
boiling
oil
indians
more
indians
worming
their
way
into
his
family
and
now
stealing
from
his
mine
came
looking
for
lead
did
they
he
growled
we
give
them
lead
round
me
up
a
couple
of
good
marksmen
and
i
meet
you
down
in
the
taproom
he
heard
no
sound
for
a
moment
and
wondered
what
eli
was
doing
and
thinking
on
the
other
side
of
the
plank
door
then
eli
voice
came
i
be
for
you
raoul
gets
him
away
from
here
for
but
if
eli
and
clarissa
were
planning
to
try
to
push
him
into
a
marriage
he
knew
he
would
get
out
of
this
that
easy
pierre
bringing
an
indian
wife
and
son
home
clarissa
trying
to
trap
him
into
a
marriage
he
began
to
feel
as
if
he
had
walked
into
some
kind
of
an
ambush
and
indians
at
the
mine
he
eyed
clarissa
who
sat
with
a
pillow
between
her
bare
back
and
the
log
wall
sheet
and
blanket
pulled
up
to
her
shoulders
he
walked
over
to
her
to
make
sure
he
could
not
be
heard
from
outside
i
going
to
have
to
ride
out
to
the
mine
and
i
be
taking
your
father
with
me
he
said
keeping
his
voice
soft
wait
till
you
hear
us
ride
away
then
get
out
of
here
and
make
sure
nobody
sees
you
she
was
still
oh
raoul
if
he
was
to
catch
me
with
you
beat
me
that
injun
ever
beat
you
raoul
leaned
forward
and
put
his
hand
gently
but
firmly
on
her
throat
if
he
ever
finds
out
from
you
that
you
and
i
were
together
he
said
softly
i
beat
you
even
worse
than
that
in
the
taproom
on
the
first
floor
of
the
inn
eli
a
short
skinny
man
whose
thinning
blond
hair
was
turning
gray
gave
no
sign
of
knowing
that
clarissa
was
in
the
room
upstairs
where
did
he
think
she
was
raoul
wondered
maybe
he
knew
but
was
biding
his
time
winnebago
with
a
bundle
of
beaver
pelts
come
in
this
morning
eli
said
said
that
for
an
extra
cupful
of
whiskey
he
tell
me
a
thing
i
might
like
to
know
i
obliged
and
he
told
me
riding
over
here
yesterday
he
seen
smoke
rising
from
the
prairie
he
went
for
a
and
it
was
three
sauk
bucks
carrying
galena
out
of
the
mine
and
smelting
it
down
eli
had
rounded
up
three
big
men
to
ride
out
with
raoul
levi
pope
a
tall
sucker
an
illinois
man
carried
a
kentucky
rifle
that
almost
came
up
to
his
shoulder
otto
wegner
a
veteran
of
the
army
of
the
king
of
prussia
was
six
foot
three
with
broad
shoulders
he
wore
his
brown
mustache
thick
and
let
it
grow
back
over
his
cheeks
to
join
his
sideburns
hodge
hode
like
eli
was
a
puke
a
missourian
huge
as
a
grizzly
bear
he
dressed
in
fringed
buckskins
under
his
coonskin
cap
red
hair
wild
and
knotted
hung
down
to
his
shoulders
and
his
red
beard
hid
three
quarters
of
his
face
besides
their
long
rifles
eli
levi
hodge
and
otto
had
pistols
stuck
through
their
belts
powder
horns
slung
over
their
shoulders
hunting
knives
sheathed
in
pockets
in
the
front
of
their
buckskin
shirts
raoul
let
them
each
have
a
glass
of
whiskey
his
good
whiskey
old
kaintuck
from
a
stone
jug
not
the
corn
liquor
he
dispensed
from
the
barrel
in
the
taproom
then
the
five
of
them
went
out
to
mount
their
horses
in
the
courtyard
of
the
trading
post
raoul
rode
his
chestnut
stallion
banner
raoul
thought
proudly
as
he
looked
around
surrounding
the
trading
post
was
a
palisade
twenty
feet
high
made
of
logs
set
vertically
with
a
catwalk
running
all
around
it
and
a
guard
tower
in
each
corner
from
a
pole
atop
the
southwest
tower
flew
the
flag
of
the
united
states
thirteen
stripes
and
stars
and
below
it
the
flag
of
the
de
marions
illinois
fur
company
an
arrow
and
a
musket
crossing
behind
a
beaver
pelt
dominating
the
buildings
inside
the
palisade
was
a
blockhouse
limestone
at
ground
level
with
an
overhanging
second
story
of
logs
and
rifle
slits
all
around
raoul
had
built
it
to
fortify
the
trading
post
against
his
memories
of
checagou
pierre
and
papa
might
have
thought
it
foolish
expense
and
effort
but
where
had
they
been
when
he
needed
them
near
the
east
side
of
the
blockhouse
was
the
inn
they
just
left
a
log
house
food
and
drink
on
the
ground
floor
and
lodgings
above
on
the
west
side
the
fur
store
over
in
the
northwest
corner
was
the
magazine
a
windowless
cube
of
limestone
blocks
surrounded
by
its
own
little
palisade
the
height
of
a
man
here
were
stored
the
bags
and
barrels
of
gunpowder
that
passed
through
the
trading
post
they
rode
out
through
the
gateway
arched
over
by
the
name
de
marion
formed
out
of
small
bits
of
log
by
raoul
frank
hopkins
carpenter
and
printer
raoul
glanced
down
at
the
town
of
victor
built
on
the
steep
slope
below
the
trading
post
from
here
he
could
see
mostly
roofs
and
log
chimneys
following
the
road
that
zigzagged
across
the
face
of
the
bluff
the
houses
all
faced
west
with
their
backs
to
the
limestone
slope
north
and
south
from
the
base
of
the
bluff
stretched
miles
of
bottomland
along
the
mississippi
river
the
spring
floods
that
left
the
bottom
some
of
the
richest
farmland
in
the
world
also
made
it
necessary
to
build
almost
everything
on
the
bluff
above
the
line
raoul
pulled
banner
head
around
and
led
his
little
troop
at
a
trot
along
the
ridge
that
ran
east
now
victoire
came
into
view
the
château
his
father
and
brother
had
built
on
the
edge
of
the
prairie
its
first
floor
like
that
of
the
blockhouse
of
stone
its
upper
two
stories
of
timber
some
day
he
thought
as
he
rode
past
the
hill
crowned
by
the
great
house
he
would
enter
victoire
as
master
they
rode
on
passing
big
log
barns
and
animal
sheds
raoul
had
helped
build
they
followed
a
narrow
trail
through
fields
planted
in
corn
and
wheat
through
orchards
the
trees
as
yet
only
a
little
higher
than
a
man
but
already
yielding
apples
and
peaches
farther
out
still
cattle
and
horses
grazed
on
grassland
that
rolled
eastward
like
the
waves
of
the
ocean
five
miles
from
the
mississippi
they
came
to
the
boundary
stone
with
an
m
carved
on
it
that
marked
victoire
easternmost
extent
from
there
raoul
could
see
a
good
ten
miles
or
more
away
the
sign
of
the
indians
a
long
finger
of
gray
smoke
leaning
northeastward
among
the
fluffy
white
clouds
the
mine
entrance
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
ravine
carved
in
the
prairie
by
the
peach
river
and
the
smoke
doubtless
meant
the
indians
were
smelting
lead
after
a
long
ride
they
reached
the
little
river
the
five
men
reined
up
and
tethered
their
horses
downwind
from
the
smoke
an
indian
it
was
said
had
a
sense
of
smell
as
keen
as
a
dog
raoul
led
his
men
to
the
edge
of
the
ravine
they
walked
quietly
along
the
ravine
until
they
sighted
indians
down
at
the
bottom
sauk
or
fox
raoul
saw
recognizing
their
shaven
heads
with
tufts
of
hair
in
the
center
one
of
the
bucks
was
standing
at
the
mine
entrance
holding
a
skin
sack
that
appeared
to
be
full
of
chunks
of
galena
lead
ore
the
other
two
were
adding
logs
to
the
smelter
fire
their
six
horses
three
for
riding
and
three
for
carrying
lead
were
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
river
about
ten
feet
from
the
smelter
the
indians
smelter
was
simply
a
square
pit
dug
in
the
hillside
lined
with
rocks
at
the
bottom
and
filled
with
logs
and
brushwood
they
were
melting
down
the
galena
letting
it
flow
through
the
rocks
into
a
slanting
trench
that
led
to
a
square
mold
dug
in
the
earth
raoul
counted
five
pigs
of
lead
already
formed
cooled
and
stacked
beside
the
mold
they
probably
been
at
this
ever
since
the
end
of
winter
thinking
the
mine
was
so
far
from
town
that
no
white
man
would
notice
lead
was
selling
at
seventeen
dollars
per
thousand
pounds
at
the
pit
head
up
north
in
galena
the
new
boom
town
named
for
the
ore
and
if
these
indians
had
been
working
since
the
snow
melted
they
might
have
robbed
raoul
of
as
much
as
two
hundred
dollars
raoul
thought
he
recognized
the
two
bucks
at
the
smelter
last
fall
they
had
come
to
him
as
he
was
bossing
the
crew
he
put
to
work
expanding
the
mine
before
he
shut
it
down
for
the
winter
the
indians
had
claimed
it
was
their
mine
he
had
told
them
to
be
off
and
when
they
moved
quickly
enough
he
and
his
men
had
cocked
their
flintlocks
should
have
killed
them
then
raoul
gripped
the
gilded
butt
of
the
pistol
that
hung
at
his
waist
and
slid
it
out
of
its
holster
get
them
he
called
standing
up
suddenly
he
stretched
out
his
arm
sighted
along
the
barrel
of
his
pistol
and
fired
at
the
nearer
indian
standing
by
the
smelter
four
rifles
went
off
at
once
raoul
was
enveloped
in
the
bitter
smell
of
gunpowder
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
the
indian
raoul
had
aimed
at
jerked
fell
to
his
knees
then
collapsed
face
forward
beside
the
smelter
the
other
one
at
the
smelter
ran
for
his
horse
and
leaped
on
its
back
they
must
have
all
aimed
at
the
same
one
raoul
thought
cursing
himself
for
not
thinking
of
pointing
out
targets
for
each
man
the
third
indian
had
disappeared
the
skin
sack
of
galena
lay
beside
the
mine
entrance
dammit
said
raoul
if
that
redskin
on
the
horse
gets
away
be
raiding
parties
coming
here
whoever
digs
here
have
to
have
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head
i
put
an
eye
in
the
back
of
head
said
eli
as
he
poured
powder
from
his
measure
down
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
he
grinned
at
raoul
two
upper
front
teeth
missing
and
one
lower
did
he
know
about
clarissa
raoul
still
could
tell
the
other
men
were
also
reloading
raoul
pushed
powder
and
shot
down
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
then
took
a
percussion
cap
out
of
a
pouch
at
his
belt
and
pressed
it
onto
the
nipple
in
the
breach
by
the
time
he
was
ready
to
fire
the
indian
was
galloping
down
the
riverbed
and
had
disappeared
around
a
bend
hodge
hode
levi
pope
and
otto
wegner
ran
for
their
horses
eli
stayed
where
he
was
smiling
down
at
the
rifle
in
his
hands
as
if
he
were
holding
a
baby
if
we
all
chase
after
the
one
on
horseback
eli
said
the
one
hiding
will
run
off
in
the
other
direction
true
enough
said
raoul
by
this
time
hodge
levi
and
otto
had
ridden
off
another
thing
eli
said
our
boys
is
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
ravine
when
the
injun
comes
out
he
come
out
on
the
south
side
by
the
time
they
ride
down
and
in
and
up
and
out
again
he
be
a
mile
away
so
what
do
we
do
asked
raoul
it
all
flat
land
hereabouts
before
raoul
could
demand
an
explanation
of
that
he
saw
the
fleeing
indian
on
his
mount
scramble
out
of
the
ravine
and
ride
southward
just
as
eli
had
predicted
raoul
glanced
at
his
men
as
they
came
to
a
halt
puzzlement
showing
in
their
gestures
hodge
fired
at
the
indian
who
rode
on
unharmed
though
raoul
would
not
have
known
what
else
to
do
he
despised
his
two
men
for
their
uselessness
soon
the
indian
riding
south
was
a
tiny
dark
silhouette
against
the
yellow
prairie
eli
raised
the
barrel
of
his
kentucky
long
rifle
it
was
an
impossible
shot
raoul
thought
but
he
said
nothing
eli
seemed
to
be
aiming
slightly
high
not
straight
at
the
redskin
raoul
heard
the
puke
suck
in
a
deep
breath
through
his
missing
front
teeth
the
rifle
boomed
the
muzzle
flash
made
raoul
blink
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
drifted
across
the
canyon
a
long
time
seemed
to
pass
with
nothing
happening
but
maybe
it
was
only
a
heartbeat
or
two
then
the
dark
distant
figure
threw
up
his
arms
and
toppled
sideways
from
his
horse
the
horse
kept
running
and
was
gone
over
the
horizon
a
moment
later
right
through
his
noodle
eli
said
i
could
of
made
that
shot
if
he
had
been
riding
due
south
too
hard
to
get
a
lead
on
him
arch
the
bullet
just
right
eli
made
it
seem
just
a
simple
matter
of
skill
but
raoul
felt
as
if
he
had
just
seen
a
miracle
the
faces
of
the
other
men
as
they
climbed
down
from
their
horses
showed
as
much
awe
as
raoul
felt
pretty
good
shooting
for
a
puke
said
levi
pope
any
sucker
could
do
eli
returned
genially
raoul
said
otto
go
get
that
indian
body
and
bring
it
back
here
otto
wegner
turned
at
once
to
remount
his
horse
raoul
liked
the
way
the
prussian
obeyed
every
order
instantly
but
hodge
hode
glowered
at
raoul
waste
of
time
coyotes
and
buzzards
have
a
taste
for
injun
meat
annoyed
at
being
questioned
raoul
said
i
do
want
anybody
to
know
what
happened
to
these
redskins
as
otto
rode
off
eli
pointing
to
the
mine
entrance
said
we
got
one
still
alive
at
least
one
i
take
care
of
him
said
raoul
eli
hodge
and
levi
looked
at
him
surprised
eli
fine
shot
had
not
only
awed
him
he
felt
it
uneasily
as
a
challenge
the
law
was
absent
in
smith
county
which
was
the
way
raoul
liked
it
gave
an
edge
to
a
man
who
could
handle
a
rifle
as
well
as
eli
but
now
to
make
sure
his
own
word
remained
the
closest
thing
to
law
in
these
parts
raoul
felt
he
had
to
equal
eli
accomplishment
he
checked
the
load
in
his
pistol
he
gripped
the
hilt
of
the
knife
at
his
belt
and
loosened
it
in
its
sheath
a
blacksmith
in
louis
had
made
it
for
him
assuring
him
it
was
an
exact
replica
of
the
knife
designed
a
couple
of
years
ago
by
the
famed
arkansas
frontiersman
jim
bowie
raoul
mouth
was
dry
his
heart
was
beating
so
hard
he
thought
his
men
must
be
able
to
see
his
woollen
coat
quivering
his
hands
were
cold
and
sweaty
ai
but
one
way
out
of
that
mine
is
there
said
eli
if
we
go
in
four
abreast
he
ca
get
past
us
and
it
a
hell
of
a
sight
safer
i
take
care
of
him
raoul
repeated
every
word
eli
said
against
his
going
into
the
mine
alone
made
him
even
more
determined
to
do
it
he
needed
to
keep
eli
in
line
especially
if
it
should
turn
out
that
eli
knew
about
him
and
clarissa
he
might
have
a
rifle
said
eli
might
shoot
you
when
you
walk
in
there
if
we
all
go
in
one
of
you
might
get
shot
said
raoul
this
is
my
property
fighting
for
it
will
make
it
more
truly
my
property
than
any
government
grant
but
that
indian
in
there
what
was
he
armed
with
rifle
knife
bow
tomahawk
how
strong
was
he
how
fast
how
skilled
in
fighting
hand
to
hand
a
fool
to
put
myself
through
could
be
one
in
there
said
eli
raoul
felt
the
blood
run
hot
through
his
veins
as
he
thought
of
bastard
son
of
black
salmon
of
the
potawatomi
who
raped
and
murdered
helene
his
men
had
killed
two
indians
today
but
there
was
a
third
waiting
in
that
mine
and
raoul
de
marion
meant
to
be
the
death
of
him
ignoring
eli
warnings
he
moved
toward
the
black
square
of
the
mine
entrance
he
walked
slowly
pistol
at
waist
level
he
needed
his
knife
out
too
he
decided
even
though
he
was
it
would
be
better
to
have
a
second
weapon
ready
than
have
his
left
hand
empty
he
drew
his
knife
taking
heart
from
its
feel
he
stepped
under
the
logs
he
set
last
fall
to
brace
the
entrance
should
he
light
a
candle
no
that
would
make
him
an
even
better
target
he
tried
to
pierce
the
blackness
with
his
eyes
it
was
thick
as
a
wool
curtain
this
was
foolish
he
thought
if
they
all
went
in
together
the
way
eli
said
a
couple
of
men
could
carry
candles
and
they
could
flush
out
the
indian
in
no
time
this
way
he
was
going
to
get
himself
killed
if
the
indian
had
a
rifle
raoul
was
dead
for
sure
he
felt
an
urge
to
back
out
and
call
the
others
to
help
him
he
stood
there
a
moment
legs
trembling
no
he
had
to
kill
his
indian
by
himself
he
had
to
show
eli
and
the
rest
he
forced
his
feet
to
slide
forward
as
silently
as
he
could
manage
his
hesitation
had
given
his
eyes
a
chance
to
get
used
to
the
dark
he
tried
to
remember
the
layout
of
the
mine
in
the
dim
light
from
the
entrance
he
made
out
the
downward
slope
of
the
long
tunnel
about
twenty
feet
in
another
tunnel
branched
off
to
his
left
his
eyes
ached
as
they
tried
to
find
the
enemy
hiding
somewhere
ahead
of
him
he
could
see
nothing
but
black
walls
lined
with
logs
to
brace
the
ceiling
a
floor
littered
with
chunks
of
rock
as
he
moved
forward
the
tunnel
got
narrower
the
ceiling
lower
he
could
almost
feel
the
weight
of
the
rock
and
earth
above
him
these
logs
could
suddenly
give
way
and
the
prairie
come
down
on
him
like
a
boot
on
a
bug
he
began
to
be
more
afraid
of
the
mine
than
he
was
of
the
hidden
indian
he
came
to
the
branch
tunnel
and
peered
into
it
with
a
shriek
the
indian
sprang
at
him
raoul
glimpsed
a
steel
tomahawk
edge
coming
at
his
head
he
jerked
the
pistol
trigger
and
jabbed
with
the
knife
in
his
left
hand
to
parry
the
axe
blade
the
blast
of
the
pistol
deafened
raoul
and
in
the
momentary
blaze
of
light
he
saw
the
face
of
a
young
indian
distorted
with
anger
and
fear
it
was
a
face
he
hated
on
sight
dark
skin
narrow
black
eyes
flat
but
for
a
beak
of
a
nose
shaven
skull
a
face
like
those
in
his
nightmares
it
stayed
vivid
in
his
mind
eye
when
the
flash
of
light
was
gone
the
indian
war
whoop
ended
in
a
cry
of
pain
the
sonofabitch
raoul
exulted
he
been
holding
his
pistol
low
must
have
hit
the
indian
in
the
gut
the
flash
had
temporarily
blinded
him
but
reflexes
honed
in
dozens
of
riverfront
brawls
took
over
he
jammed
his
pistol
into
its
holster
and
switched
the
knife
to
his
right
hand
every
fiber
of
him
hungered
to
kill
he
lunged
forward
knife
straight
out
in
front
of
him
he
could
feel
his
lips
stretching
in
a
grin
the
knife
hit
something
solid
yet
yielding
with
a
yell
of
triumph
he
drove
the
point
in
was
rewarded
with
a
scream
of
agony
he
was
beginning
to
see
again
the
shadow
facing
him
lifted
the
tomahawk
raoul
jerked
the
knife
free
and
swung
it
chunked
into
the
indian
arm
like
a
meat
cleaver
he
heard
the
tomahawk
clang
on
the
rock
floor
raoul
threw
himself
on
the
indian
stabbing
stabbing
his
enemy
body
smaller
and
lighter
than
his
crumpled
under
his
weight
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
dug
into
smooth
skin
and
hard
muscle
he
felt
hands
pushing
against
him
but
their
efforts
were
weak
the
struggles
of
a
dying
creature
the
cries
and
groans
of
pain
made
him
eager
to
hurt
the
indian
more
it
was
too
dark
to
see
where
his
knife
was
going
in
but
he
brought
it
down
again
and
again
his
hands
felt
wet
some
of
his
thrusts
sank
deep
others
were
stopped
by
bone
a
pulse
pounded
in
his
brain
it
did
not
matter
that
he
was
fighting
in
the
dark
fury
blinded
him
anyway
he
forgot
everything
but
the
knife
in
his
hand
and
the
soft
bloody
body
under
him
he
screamed
with
rage
and
triumph
drowning
out
the
agonized
shrieks
of
his
enemy
after
a
while
no
more
cries
the
body
under
him
did
not
move
raoul
lay
on
top
of
the
indian
panting
he
began
to
think
again
carefully
he
slid
his
hand
over
the
chest
the
buckskin
shirt
slippery
with
warm
blood
no
heartbeat
no
lifting
of
lungs
god
i
did
it
i
killed
him
he
felt
as
if
rockets
were
going
off
in
his
head
and
he
laughed
aloud
he
fought
for
his
mine
and
spilled
his
enemy
blood
to
make
it
his
own
goddamned
indian
is
ever
going
to
steal
what
belongs
to
he
climbed
to
his
feet
his
knees
were
shaking
violently
under
him
his
head
ached
so
badly
he
felt
as
if
his
eyes
were
being
pushed
out
of
his
skull
he
realized
that
in
the
fight
he
completely
lost
control
of
himself
he
become
a
wild
thing
a
creature
without
a
mind
it
had
happened
to
him
several
times
before
in
fights
that
had
ended
with
his
killing
a
man
thoughts
of
triumph
that
he
had
killed
his
enemy
of
terror
at
the
realization
that
this
fight
could
have
gone
the
other
way
chased
each
other
around
in
his
brain
but
he
felt
even
more
alive
and
happier
than
he
had
last
night
with
clarissa
sudden
light
dazzled
him
an
arrow
of
fear
shot
through
him
more
indians
raoul
it
was
eli
greenglove
voice
his
eyes
adjusted
and
he
could
see
eli
hodge
hode
and
levi
pope
standing
at
the
entrance
to
the
side
tunnel
they
looked
at
the
body
at
his
feet
and
the
bloody
knife
in
his
hand
and
then
up
at
him
and
their
eyes
were
wide
and
their
lips
parted
looks
are
worth
as
much
to
me
as
this
whole
you
really
chopped
him
into
mincemeat
eli
said
i
have
to
get
me
one
of
them
arkansas
toothpicks
get
the
other
two
bodies
in
here
raoul
said
making
an
effort
to
keep
his
voice
steady
we
find
some
place
to
bury
them
better
search
the
whole
mine
make
sure
there
no
more
redskins
said
eli
raoul
agreed
but
he
felt
certain
this
one
he
killed
was
the
only
one
in
the
mine
he
looked
down
at
the
dead
face
the
indian
was
much
more
than
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
old
good
he
thought
had
had
long
enough
to
do
much
harm
but
why
raoul
wondered
had
this
young
buck
thrown
his
life
away
attacking
him
near
the
entrance
to
the
mine
he
have
had
more
of
a
chance
of
escaping
if
he
hidden
deeper
maybe
he
figured
there
was
at
least
a
little
light
to
see
and
fight
by
near
the
entrance
if
he
gotten
raoul
then
somehow
managed
to
get
away
he
probably
have
claimed
the
right
to
wear
a
brave
feather
the
thought
of
himself
lying
dead
in
the
dark
and
his
scalp
hanging
on
a
pole
in
front
of
a
lodge
down
at
saukenuk
made
raoul
shudder
but
it
was
raoul
who
won
his
feather
no
indian
would
ever
kill
raoul
de
marion
and
any
redskin
sluts
and
any
mongrel
bastards
that
showed
their
face
around
victoire
would
have
to
deal
with
a
man
who
killed
indians
as
easily
as
he
killed
any
other
sort
of
vermin
time
to
have
it
out
with
pierre
pierre
wanted
to
weep
as
he
saw
what
was
about
to
happen
he
rushed
forward
and
thrust
out
his
hand
to
stop
raoul
not
the
vase
he
cried
maman
had
loved
it
so
raoul
was
too
close
to
the
mantel
for
pierre
to
reach
him
in
time
he
got
to
it
in
two
strides
and
just
as
pierre
had
expected
seized
the
vase
that
had
been
in
the
family
for
four
generations
had
stood
on
the
mantel
ever
since
they
built
this
château
raoul
papa
cried
think
what
you
are
doing
raoul
turned
holding
the
vase
high
over
his
head
he
fixed
pierre
with
the
stare
of
a
madman
his
teeth
flashed
under
his
black
mustache
in
a
grimace
of
fury
he
dashed
the
vase
to
the
flagstone
floor
the
white
egg
shape
vanished
with
a
hollow
crack
and
shards
scattered
some
hitting
raoul
boots
others
flying
into
the
huge
stone
hearth
a
sudden
silence
filled
the
great
hall
of
victoire
pierre
felt
as
if
his
heart
had
broken
with
the
vase
killed
he
wanted
to
cry
out
you
would
kill
the
memory
of
but
he
held
his
tongue
and
hated
himself
for
even
thinking
what
he
had
almost
said
what
an
evil
thought
how
could
he
blame
raoul
because
maman
died
giving
birth
to
him
what
you
are
doing
papa
had
cried
that
was
precisely
what
raoul
never
did
thought
was
for
afterward
for
escaping
the
consequences
of
his
actions
now
he
had
worked
himself
into
a
rage
lost
all
governing
of
himself
because
somehow
he
had
heard
about
sun
woman
and
gray
cloud
pierre
had
to
try
to
win
raoul
over
to
find
a
way
to
break
through
the
anger
that
divided
him
from
his
younger
brother
raoul
had
to
be
persuaded
that
it
was
only
right
that
sun
woman
and
the
boy
be
brought
here
to
victoire
if
raoul
did
not
accept
that
his
rage
would
tear
their
family
apart
but
how
in
one
afternoon
batter
down
a
wall
that
had
been
building
over
the
past
dozen
years
pierre
realized
that
he
was
still
standing
with
his
hand
held
out
to
raoul
he
lowered
it
slowly
feeling
his
shoulders
slump
at
the
same
time
he
had
been
reading
with
papa
when
raoul
came
in
now
he
took
off
his
spectacles
put
them
in
the
silver
case
that
hung
from
his
neck
by
a
velvet
cord
and
dropped
the
case
in
his
vest
pocket
elysée
de
marion
clutched
the
arms
of
his
leather
wing
chair
with
clawlike
hands
half
rising
from
it
raoul
stood
staring
at
the
two
of
them
panting
and
trembling
elysée
said
quietly
why
did
you
do
that
raoul
to
make
you
listen
raoul
voice
was
deep
and
strong
and
it
resounded
powerfully
against
the
beamed
ceiling
and
stone
walls
of
the
great
hall
but
in
its
tones
pierre
heard
the
screams
of
that
hysterical
boy
whose
tantrums
and
nightmares
after
they
finally
succeeded
in
ransoming
him
from
the
potawatomi
had
wrenched
the
hearts
of
the
whole
household
and
renewed
their
grief
over
the
loss
of
helene
but
now
that
painfully
thin
frightened
child
was
a
man
over
six
feet
tall
with
a
knife
as
big
as
a
broadsword
and
a
pistol
strapped
to
his
waist
a
very
dangerous
man
a
man
who
they
said
had
killed
half
a
dozen
or
more
opponents
in
fights
up
and
down
the
mississippi
we
have
been
listening
elysée
said
pierre
has
raoul
said
resentfully
tell
him
papa
tell
him
he
better
leave
his
damned
squaw
in
the
woods
where
she
belongs
the
words
pierced
pierre
chest
like
arrows
elysée
sat
back
down
in
his
wing
chair
and
stroked
his
jaw
he
looked
like
an
old
turkey
cock
with
fierce
eyes
a
hooked
nose
and
a
long
wrinkled
neck
the
copy
of
montaigne
essays
that
had
been
lying
in
his
lap
had
slipped
to
the
floor
to
join
newspapers
piled
around
his
feet
like
autumn
leaves
a
mixture
of
local
papers
like
frank
hopkins
and
the
galena
papers
from
the
east
the
york
evening
the
evening
the
from
washington
city
the
even
older
copies
of
de
from
paris
come
here
both
of
you
elysée
sighed
hoping
his
father
could
reconcile
them
where
he
had
failed
so
dismally
pierre
went
to
stand
before
elysée
chair
after
a
moment
hesitation
raoul
approached
too
but
pierre
saw
that
he
was
pointedly
keeping
more
than
an
distance
between
the
two
of
them
elysée
said
that
better
i
ca
see
you
when
you
stand
far
from
me
these
eyes
are
good
for
very
little
but
reading
and
when
i
can
no
longer
read
i
will
shoot
myself
and
if
i
can
not
see
well
enough
to
load
the
pistol
one
of
you
must
do
it
for
me
as
he
often
did
elysée
was
attempting
to
use
humor
to
put
out
the
fire
pierre
glanced
at
raoul
to
see
if
their
father
had
drawn
a
smile
from
him
but
raoul
stood
with
arms
folded
across
his
chest
his
mouth
hidden
under
his
black
mustache
his
eyes
narrowed
except
when
he
smiled
and
today
he
was
far
from
any
smiling
the
mustache
made
him
look
perpetually
angry
raoul
elysée
said
be
assured
that
we
are
listening
to
you
tell
us
what
has
driven
you
to
destroy
one
of
our
family
treasures
just
because
pierre
soiled
himself
with
a
squaw
raoul
demanded
do
we
have
to
live
with
what
came
of
it
pierre
felt
his
face
burn
he
wanted
to
slap
raoul
life
with
sun
woman
was
as
honorable
as
my
life
with
he
forced
himself
to
control
his
temper
if
he
became
as
angry
as
raoul
was
this
day
would
surely
be
the
ruin
of
the
house
of
de
marion
pierre
felt
a
sudden
twinge
of
pain
in
his
belly
he
fought
down
an
urge
to
rub
himself
there
he
wanted
no
one
to
know
about
his
illness
worse
than
the
pain
was
the
fear
it
brought
on
the
chilling
suspicion
that
he
was
a
dying
man
fearfully
he
wondered
what
death
would
be
like
though
père
isaac
said
such
notions
were
foolish
he
could
not
help
seeing
god
the
father
as
an
enormous
judge
seated
among
the
clouds
and
what
would
the
father
sentence
be
if
pierre
de
marion
turned
his
back
on
a
wife
and
a
son
he
wished
he
could
tell
raoul
that
he
thought
he
was
dying
then
perhaps
his
brother
would
understand
why
he
had
to
do
his
duty
to
sun
woman
and
the
boy
but
he
feared
that
if
raoul
was
aware
of
his
weakness
he
would
try
to
take
over
the
whole
estate
at
once
praying
that
his
brother
would
understand
he
said
ever
since
died
i
have
been
thinking
of
sun
woman
after
five
years
of
life
together
i
left
her
and
our
little
son
lately
i
have
been
seeing
her
and
my
son
gray
cloud
in
dreams
i
know
god
wants
me
to
make
amends
to
them
pierre
felt
sweat
break
out
on
his
forehead
and
upper
lip
why
must
raoul
stir
up
such
turmoil
with
his
hatred
could
raoul
understand
that
not
all
red
people
were
like
the
ones
he
had
encountered
pierre
saw
sun
woman
in
his
mind
so
strong
and
wise
holding
the
hand
of
their
grave
boy
how
beautiful
they
were
elysée
said
i
do
not
believe
that
le
bon
dieu
announces
his
intentions
in
dreams
pierre
always
the
cynic
papa
had
read
too
much
voltaire
elysée
turned
to
raoul
but
raoul
it
does
seem
simple
justice
what
pierre
wants
to
do
what
about
justice
for
me
raoul
came
back
is
this
my
home
as
much
as
pierre
stung
by
raoul
bluster
pierre
said
raoul
you
live
more
at
your
trading
post
than
you
do
in
this
home
to
pierre
surprise
raoul
face
reddened
making
pierre
wonder
what
exactly
raoul
was
doing
at
the
trading
post
it
had
seemed
natural
that
he
would
spend
most
of
his
time
there
since
papa
had
given
him
the
illinois
fur
company
when
he
divided
his
property
between
the
two
of
them
but
perhaps
it
was
not
only
work
that
kept
raoul
at
the
trading
post
night
after
night
a
woman
pierre
found
himself
hoping
it
might
be
a
woman
could
be
good
for
raoul
civilize
him
a
bit
he
had
slept
there
last
night
how
then
could
he
have
learned
about
pierre
plans
for
sun
woman
and
gray
cloud
someone
in
our
household
spying
on
me
pierre
turned
to
raoul
how
did
you
learn
about
this
i
was
going
to
tell
you
but
you
found
out
before
i
could
pierre
took
some
small
satisfaction
in
seeing
raoul
cheeks
flush
a
deeper
red
in
seeing
his
hesitation
he
had
come
storming
in
here
unprepared
to
explain
just
how
he
knew
about
pierre
plans
raoul
said
i
overheard
you
and
papa
talking
about
it
absurd
we
did
not
speak
of
this
till
this
morning
you
were
not
here
could
armand
have
heard
and
told
raoul
armand
must
certainly
know
about
marchette
pierre
thought
but
he
knew
armand
would
never
directly
attack
him
armand
ancestors
had
come
to
america
when
this
part
of
the
country
was
still
new
france
and
such
people
retained
a
feudal
outlook
the
poor
fellow
doubtless
considered
him
far
superior
in
birth
and
breeding
but
he
was
capable
of
seeking
some
kind
of
revenge
such
as
turning
raoul
against
him
pierre
opened
his
mouth
to
chide
raoul
for
setting
one
of
the
servants
to
spy
on
him
but
he
closed
it
again
when
he
saw
the
look
of
reproach
in
raoul
face
his
brother
felt
betrayed
too
he
had
never
stopped
feeling
betrayed
since
the
massacre
at
checagou
then
how
could
pierre
expect
him
to
be
reconciled
to
what
must
be
done
now
perhaps
it
would
be
best
to
leave
sun
woman
and
gray
cloud
where
they
were
he
could
just
send
them
gifts
doubtless
they
were
content
his
own
years
with
the
sauk
and
fox
had
shown
him
what
a
good
life
they
had
so
simple
so
closely
attuned
to
nature
so
constantly
aware
of
the
things
of
the
spirit
those
years
had
been
the
happiest
of
his
life
no
sending
gifts
from
afar
would
not
be
enough
it
would
be
as
if
he
was
hiding
his
indian
wife
and
son
away
concealing
his
sin
in
the
wilderness
as
he
had
been
doing
all
these
years
to
his
shame
the
boy
gray
cloud
was
flesh
of
his
flesh
the
only
child
he
had
in
the
world
he
was
a
de
marion
as
much
as
he
was
a
sauk
indian
he
had
a
right
to
come
here
and
to
know
what
his
heritage
was
he
had
a
right
to
know
his
father
in
the
time
his
father
had
left
to
him
can
not
face
god
and
tell
him
i
turned
my
back
on
my
and
that
beautiful
sauk
way
of
life
what
a
fragile
thing
it
was
powers
were
massing
pierre
knew
to
drive
them
from
their
homeland
to
force
them
to
choose
exile
in
the
great
american
desert
or
annihilation
knowledge
might
help
gray
cloud
meet
that
threat
from
the
depths
of
his
chair
elysée
said
pierre
it
is
quite
obvious
what
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
it
is
distasteful
to
speak
of
wills
and
inheritances
but
it
is
best
to
be
candid
raoul
is
afraid
that
you
will
marry
this
indian
woman
and
make
her
son
your
heir
in
place
of
him
can
you
set
his
mind
at
rest
pierre
stared
at
raoul
ten
years
ago
on
the
day
of
pierre
wedding
to
gagner
papa
announced
that
he
was
getting
on
in
years
and
was
transferring
ownership
of
the
de
marion
estate
to
pierre
the
older
of
his
sons
this
january
consumption
had
taken
poor
frail
still
childless
the
place
of
raoul
fourteen
years
younger
than
pierre
in
the
line
of
inheritance
was
now
a
certainty
surely
raoul
could
not
be
afraid
that
pierre
would
take
a
sauk
indian
boy
who
knew
no
other
life
but
woodland
and
make
him
heir
to
the
de
marion
fortune
the
notion
was
so
bizarre
that
it
had
never
even
crossed
pierre
mind
papa
sitting
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
day
after
day
reading
reading
would
sometimes
entertain
the
most
ridiculous
fantasies
pierre
observed
that
raoul
looked
equally
startled
then
pierre
saw
raoul
expression
change
from
surprise
to
dawning
anger
papa
had
inadvertently
given
raoul
a
new
reason
to
be
angry
hoping
to
pluck
out
the
suspicion
before
it
took
root
pierre
quickly
said
my
god
raoul
i
have
no
intention
of
changing
my
will
the
boy
who
is
called
gray
cloud
is
my
natural
son
that
is
all
since
i
have
no
legitimate
children
you
are
my
heir
surely
you
see
that
raoul
black
mustache
drew
back
from
his
teeth
what
i
do
see
brother
of
mine
is
why
in
hell
you
could
get
a
proper
son
in
almost
ten
years
of
marriage
with
that
squaw
use
you
up
again
pierre
felt
like
striking
raoul
his
face
grew
hot
elysée
asked
how
old
would
this
gray
cloud
be
pierre
frowned
subtracting
dates
he
was
born
in
so
he
would
have
just
turned
fifteen
he
turned
again
to
raoul
perhaps
knowing
what
he
really
did
have
in
mind
for
gray
cloud
would
calm
his
brother
somewhat
he
said
père
isaac
the
jesuit
visits
the
british
band
regularly
i
make
offerings
to
the
jesuit
mission
in
kaskaskia
and
i
asked
him
to
teach
the
boy
a
little
english
some
elementary
letters
and
ciphering
now
i
want
to
see
gray
cloud
for
myself
see
what
sort
of
person
he
has
become
and
i
want
him
to
know
me
and
if
i
thought
he
could
benefit
from
it
i
might
help
him
to
be
educated
i
might
send
him
to
that
secondary
school
in
new
york
where
our
cousin
emilie
husband
is
headmaster
educate
him
so
he
can
take
over
here
raoul
demanded
and
heart
sank
perhaps
he
should
not
have
said
anything
about
educating
the
boy
he
had
momentarily
forgotten
what
a
disaster
raoul
year
in
new
york
had
been
what
with
whores
drink
money
thrown
away
at
cards
brawls
with
street
toughs
and
the
police
the
effort
to
educate
raoul
had
ended
when
he
beat
his
latin
teacher
so
badly
the
man
was
in
new
york
hospital
for
a
month
it
had
cost
papa
a
fortune
to
persuade
the
teacher
not
to
press
charges
of
course
raoul
would
be
insulted
at
the
suggestions
that
a
savage
indian
boy
might
succeed
where
he
had
disgraced
himself
no
raoul
pierre
shook
his
head
vigorously
at
the
most
i
might
want
his
mother
and
him
to
have
a
small
bequest
not
even
as
much
as
will
go
to
nicole
so
little
you
would
never
miss
it
surely
you
would
not
let
greed
for
wealth
and
property
come
between
us
i
came
here
today
to
protect
our
family
honor
and
you
call
me
greedy
raoul
broad
chest
heaved
what
i
propose
honorable
how
could
you
consider
it
honorable
to
make
indians
part
of
our
family
after
what
they
did
to
us
it
hurt
pierre
to
call
those
awful
memories
to
mind
yes
perhaps
if
he
had
been
there
and
suffered
as
raoul
had
and
had
seen
helene
raped
and
murdered
he
might
hate
indians
as
his
brother
did
pierre
said
raoul
when
i
was
with
sun
woman
i
knew
nothing
of
what
happened
to
helene
and
you
once
the
war
broke
out
in
i
was
in
effect
a
prisoner
and
had
no
word
from
the
white
world
the
sauk
held
me
for
three
years
from
the
start
of
the
war
and
then
when
i
found
out
why
do
you
think
i
left
sun
woman
and
gray
cloud
and
never
returned
only
sent
messages
through
the
priest
never
tried
to
see
them
it
was
because
after
i
learned
about
helene
about
what
they
did
to
you
i
even
raoul
could
not
be
with
indians
anymore
it
has
taken
all
these
years
before
i
could
face
them
again
elysée
said
with
a
frown
raoul
you
keep
mentioning
that
this
woman
and
her
child
whom
your
brother
wishes
to
help
are
indians
as
if
that
in
itself
made
them
intolerable
now
i
could
quite
agree
if
they
were
englishmen
raoul
spoke
in
a
low
steady
growl
being
indians
does
make
them
intolerable
they
animals
pierre
felt
anger
growing
inside
him
he
was
trying
to
understand
raoul
but
raoul
insults
were
becoming
more
provocation
than
he
could
endure
animals
said
elysée
incredulously
come
now
raoul
surely
you
do
not
believe
that
the
red
people
are
as
human
as
we
are
raoul
laughed
bitterly
sure
you
have
to
say
they
human
otherwise
pierre
mating
with
one
of
them
would
be
like
a
farmer
mounting
one
of
his
sheep
something
exploded
in
pierre
brain
and
he
heard
his
own
cry
of
anguish
as
if
from
a
long
way
off
he
felt
tears
running
from
eyes
blinded
with
fury
and
when
his
eyes
cleared
all
he
could
see
was
raoul
sneer
he
burned
to
smash
his
fist
into
those
teeth
under
that
black
mustache
silence
that
filthy
tongue
he
lunged
forward
fist
drawn
back
raoul
caught
his
arm
in
an
iron
grip
but
the
force
of
pierre
rush
threw
his
brother
back
against
the
great
chimney
pierre
reached
to
grab
raoul
neck
and
slam
his
head
against
the
stone
stop
elysée
cried
the
old
man
stood
up
more
quickly
than
pierre
had
seen
him
do
in
years
and
pushed
himself
between
them
suddenly
afraid
that
his
father
might
be
hurt
pierre
forced
himself
to
let
go
of
raoul
every
muscle
in
his
body
went
rigid
and
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
you
must
control
yourselves
elysée
said
pierre
you
raised
your
hand
against
your
brother
pierre
took
a
step
backward
still
shaking
how
could
this
father
reproach
after
what
raoul
had
just
said
voice
of
pierre
thought
bitterly
does
not
know
there
are
some
feelings
that
can
not
be
reasoned
pierre
realized
that
he
was
still
crying
raoul
having
let
go
of
his
arm
was
looking
at
him
with
disgust
i
loved
sun
woman
pierre
stammered
for
him
to
speak
of
her
so
to
speak
so
of
our
love
surely
elysée
said
raoul
spoke
in
the
heat
of
anger
i
do
take
back
a
word
raoul
said
in
a
hard
flat
voice
but
though
it
was
hard
to
read
the
features
behind
that
fierce
black
mustache
pierre
thought
he
saw
uncertainty
in
raoul
face
as
if
raoul
finally
understood
that
he
had
gone
too
far
drove
me
to
try
to
hit
him
he
never
pushed
me
that
far
perhaps
pierre
thought
raoul
would
now
apologize
appalled
at
his
own
words
he
might
seek
to
be
reconciled
will
make
no
more
overtures
he
meets
every
attempt
with
pierre
waited
he
could
see
raoul
struggling
within
himself
perhaps
papa
suggestion
that
he
might
lose
his
inheritance
had
made
him
realize
what
consequences
a
rift
between
them
could
have
course
i
would
never
disinherit
raoul
there
no
one
else
who
could
manage
the
estate
after
i
die
and
i
may
be
gone
sooner
than
anyone
pierre
saw
raoul
broad
chest
swell
as
he
took
a
deep
breath
now
thought
pierre
surely
raoul
was
going
to
apologize
and
ask
forgiveness
and
they
would
work
out
some
way
that
sun
woman
and
gray
cloud
could
be
brought
here
without
stirring
up
old
hatreds
raoul
said
do
bring
indians
into
this
house
pierre
i
warn
you
if
any
indian
tries
to
claim
he
a
member
of
my
family
i
make
him
wish
he
had
never
been
born
at
all
the
pain
that
might
one
day
kill
him
sank
its
teeth
deep
into
his
guts
raoul
words
seared
him
like
a
branding
iron
he
felt
his
shoulders
sag
raoul
turned
his
back
on
his
brother
and
his
father
and
the
clump
of
his
hard
leather
boot
heels
echoed
through
the
great
hall
raoul
elysée
cried
he
held
his
hand
outstretched
as
pierre
had
when
raoul
was
about
to
smash
the
limoges
vase
looking
down
at
those
glistening
white
shards
scattered
over
the
flagstones
pierre
wondered
what
would
happen
when
raoul
inherited
the
de
marion
fortune
would
he
destroy
it
in
one
of
his
rages
as
he
had
this
beautiful
object
that
had
been
part
of
the
family
treasure
or
would
he
use
its
power
as
he
used
his
fists
and
pistol
and
knife
to
destroy
others
the
de
marion
fortune
once
it
had
been
a
huge
tract
of
land
in
northeastern
france
dominated
by
the
château
of
the
counts
de
marion
held
by
them
so
long
that
no
one
knew
when
or
how
they
first
obtained
it
just
as
the
origin
of
the
de
marions
themselves
was
something
of
a
mystery
converted
into
gold
the
de
marion
fortune
had
sailed
with
elysée
the
last
count
de
marion
his
countess
and
his
children
across
the
atlantic
elysée
in
the
early
had
foreseen
the
bloody
upheaval
that
would
sweep
away
the
king
and
the
nobility
of
france
he
had
made
a
friend
of
the
american
ambassador
to
france
thomas
jefferson
and
had
thought
much
about
jefferson
new
nation
their
revolution
was
over
and
done
with
the
de
marion
fortune
might
thrive
in
those
united
states
and
on
the
american
prairie
the
de
marion
fortune
had
purchased
a
vast
new
estate
and
built
a
new
château
elysée
sighed
and
took
a
step
toward
his
chair
pierre
turned
the
chair
toward
the
fire
so
that
its
wings
would
gather
in
the
warmth
of
the
small
fire
and
hold
it
around
his
father
body
would
you
consider
not
bringing
this
woman
and
this
boy
here
elysée
said
as
he
sat
down
to
keep
the
peace
in
our
family
pierre
hesitated
for
ten
years
sun
woman
and
gray
cloud
had
lived
in
their
world
and
he
in
his
why
provoke
so
much
strife
now
by
trying
to
change
that
but
gray
cloud
was
the
only
son
he
would
ever
have
and
if
he
left
things
as
they
were
he
would
die
without
knowing
him
she
is
my
woman
in
truth
my
wife
and
the
boy
is
my
child
pierre
said
raoul
has
much
they
have
little
raoul
is
wrong
to
cling
to
this
hatred
to
give
in
to
him
would
mean
abandoning
these
two
people
to
whom
i
owe
so
much
as
soon
as
the
weather
is
a
little
warmer
papa
i
mean
to
leave
for
saukenuk
and
i
do
dread
what
may
happen
but
yes
i
still
mean
to
come
back
with
my
wife
and
my
son
star
arrow
bear
my
name
is
white
the
sun
shining
down
through
branches
dotted
with
budding
leaves
warmed
his
back
he
wore
the
knife
his
father
had
left
him
sheathed
at
his
waist
his
eyes
searched
among
the
branches
of
the
trees
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
he
was
looking
for
but
owl
carver
said
that
he
would
know
it
when
he
found
it
he
stopped
at
the
base
of
an
oak
tree
and
looked
up
he
thought
he
heard
something
moving
through
the
bushes
on
the
upriver
side
of
the
island
he
stopped
peering
at
the
branches
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
the
black
trunks
of
the
oaks
and
hickories
rose
above
him
he
felt
as
if
he
were
standing
in
a
circle
of
wise
old
men
who
were
there
to
advise
and
protect
him
ever
since
that
time
of
sitting
in
the
sacred
cave
when
his
soul
had
gone
out
of
his
body
whenever
he
was
by
himself
he
never
felt
alone
he
felt
the
presence
of
spirits
in
all
things
trees
birds
plants
rocks
rivers
after
a
moment
listening
he
heard
nothing
strange
and
went
back
to
his
search
he
had
chosen
this
island
because
he
had
come
here
many
times
at
different
seasons
with
his
mother
gathering
plants
for
medicines
today
he
was
looking
for
one
thing
somewhere
on
this
island
grew
the
branch
from
which
he
would
cut
his
medicine
stick
owl
carver
had
carefully
instructed
him
will
call
to
you
out
of
the
forest
it
may
be
of
oak
or
maple
or
ash
or
cedar
or
even
hickory
you
will
know
it
because
it
will
not
be
like
any
other
branch
you
see
and
your
eye
will
be
drawn
to
a
cloud
drifted
over
the
sun
and
his
arms
and
shoulders
suddenly
felt
cold
the
coldness
felt
strange
and
he
remembered
that
his
spirit
guide
the
white
bear
was
said
to
live
in
a
very
cold
place
he
stood
still
he
felt
he
should
wait
for
something
to
happen
a
shaft
of
sunlight
fell
on
the
black
trunk
of
a
tree
a
short
distance
in
front
of
him
where
the
light
struck
the
tree
a
branch
was
growing
out
pointing
right
at
him
he
might
not
have
noticed
it
if
the
light
had
not
fallen
in
just
that
way
at
the
end
of
the
branch
three
bright
bur
oak
leaves
were
growing
this
was
the
moon
of
buds
and
the
limbs
of
most
trees
bore
only
the
many
round
swellings
that
would
as
the
days
grew
warmer
open
and
spread
into
the
first
leaves
but
the
three
oak
leaves
at
the
end
of
this
branch
were
fully
grown
fat
leaves
with
deep
irregular
lobes
it
was
as
owl
carver
had
said
this
branch
called
out
to
him
from
the
forest
he
went
up
to
the
tree
and
as
owl
carver
had
taught
him
he
said
grandfather
oak
please
let
me
have
your
arm
to
take
with
me
to
make
strong
medicine
for
our
tribe
i
promise
i
will
not
hurt
you
and
i
will
leave
all
your
other
arms
untouched
so
that
you
can
grow
strong
in
this
place
it
was
a
small
new
branch
growing
out
of
the
tree
at
eye
level
when
trimmed
and
stripped
it
would
be
just
the
right
size
for
a
medicine
stick
he
would
dry
the
leaves
and
keep
them
too
he
decided
as
part
of
his
medicine
bundle
with
his
knife
he
reverently
cut
the
branch
away
from
the
tree
trunk
a
voice
behind
him
said
my
son
he
jumped
startled
at
once
he
recognized
sun
woman
voice
as
always
a
warmth
flooded
through
him
at
the
sound
still
he
was
angry
with
himself
how
could
he
let
someone
slip
up
on
him
like
that
he
turned
he
looked
into
his
mother
brown
eyes
level
with
his
not
so
long
ago
he
remembered
he
had
to
look
up
to
see
into
her
eyes
he
saw
pain
tightening
the
muscles
of
her
face
her
lips
trembled
as
they
parted
only
a
few
times
had
he
seen
her
in
such
distress
and
his
heart
beat
harder
what
was
wrong
you
must
come
back
to
saukenuk
my
son
she
said
i
have
found
my
medicine
stick
mother
but
now
i
must
trim
it
here
and
peel
the
bark
in
the
place
where
i
found
it
owl
carver
told
me
how
it
must
be
done
she
swept
a
hand
across
her
body
to
say
no
to
that
it
is
owl
carver
who
says
you
must
come
now
leave
the
stick
here
the
spirits
will
protect
it
and
you
can
come
back
to
it
later
a
man
has
come
to
our
village
you
must
meet
him
tears
on
her
brown
cheeks
reflected
the
bright
sun
what
is
wrong
mother
who
is
this
man
again
the
hand
gesture
rejecting
his
question
it
is
better
you
see
for
yourself
but
you
are
sad
mother
why
she
turned
away
the
fringe
of
her
doeskin
skirt
swirling
about
her
shins
he
laid
the
severed
oak
branch
at
the
base
of
the
tree
he
had
cut
it
from
and
with
thanks
to
grandfather
oak
turned
away
baffled
and
apprehensive
he
followed
sun
woman
through
the
forest
to
the
edge
of
the
island
where
he
saw
her
small
canoe
pulled
up
beside
his
silently
they
paddled
their
canoes
side
by
side
upstream
along
the
narrow
stretch
of
water
that
separated
the
island
from
the
riverbank
the
rock
river
was
in
its
spring
flood
paddling
against
the
powerful
current
strained
white
bear
muscles
he
glanced
over
at
his
mother
and
saw
with
envy
how
easily
she
wielded
her
paddle
she
seemed
to
know
how
to
do
everything
well
but
an
expression
of
sorrow
was
frozen
on
her
face
they
left
the
island
behind
and
soon
white
bear
saw
the
hundred
lodges
of
saukenuk
through
the
weeping
willows
hackberries
maples
and
oaks
that
grew
along
the
riverbank
they
grounded
their
canoes
on
tree
roots
growing
on
the
edge
of
the
river
sun
woman
beckoned
turned
her
back
on
him
abruptly
and
started
walking
through
the
woods
by
the
riverbank
white
bear
followed
they
passed
two
newly
made
graves
in
the
shelter
of
the
trees
mounds
of
earth
each
marked
with
a
willow
wand
with
a
strip
of
deerskin
attached
to
it
coming
out
of
the
woods
they
walked
amidst
the
band
grazing
horses
through
the
meadow
surrounding
the
village
beyond
the
meadows
as
far
up
and
down
the
river
as
white
bear
could
see
stretched
fields
where
the
first
shoots
of
corn
beans
squash
and
sweet
potatoes
dotted
the
freshly
turned
black
earth
like
pale
green
stars
in
a
night
sky
white
bear
followed
sun
woman
into
the
concentric
rings
of
long
lodges
with
peaked
roofs
built
of
wooden
poles
and
walled
with
bark
sheets
laid
out
in
the
sacred
circular
pattern
here
the
sauk
lived
all
summer
three
or
four
families
to
a
lodge
but
today
the
outskirts
of
saukenuk
seemed
empty
white
bear
was
surprised
to
see
no
one
at
the
riverbank
or
about
the
lodges
sun
woman
walked
past
the
lodges
with
back
straight
legs
stiff
her
arms
rigid
at
her
sides
her
head
high
never
once
did
she
look
back
at
him
reaching
the
heart
of
saukenuk
he
saw
that
all
the
people
were
gathered
in
the
central
clearing
around
owl
carver
medicine
lodge
as
sun
woman
approached
the
crowd
a
child
spied
her
and
tugged
its
mother
skirt
the
mother
looked
first
at
sun
woman
then
at
white
bear
then
whispered
to
another
woman
standing
next
to
her
that
woman
turned
and
then
the
whispers
spread
in
every
direction
and
more
and
more
people
looked
the
crowd
parted
making
a
path
through
which
sun
woman
walked
with
her
stiff
stride
white
bear
followed
at
the
end
of
the
pathway
through
the
crowd
sat
owl
carver
and
another
man
side
by
side
at
the
door
of
the
sacred
lodge
owl
carver
long
white
hair
spread
like
a
spruce
tree
his
chest
was
bare
save
for
his
necklace
of
megis
shells
and
was
painted
with
diagonal
stripes
of
blue
and
green
the
colors
of
hope
and
fear
white
bear
slowed
his
steps
studying
the
man
seated
beside
owl
carver
his
heart
thumped
hard
when
he
saw
who
it
was
this
was
the
man
he
had
seen
in
his
vision
with
the
white
bear
and
the
turtle
he
stood
still
his
mouth
open
the
had
black
hair
streaked
with
white
tied
with
a
ribbon
at
the
back
his
face
was
dominated
by
a
powerful
beak
of
a
nose
he
must
have
spent
much
time
in
the
sun
his
skin
was
tan
though
not
as
rich
and
dark
as
the
skins
of
white
bear
people
a
beloved
face
caught
white
bear
eye
redbird
was
standing
among
the
people
looking
not
at
the
stranger
but
at
white
bear
their
eyes
met
and
hers
were
wide
with
worry
he
wanted
to
take
redbird
hand
and
run
with
her
into
the
forest
away
from
all
these
people
and
from
whatever
made
redbird
and
his
mother
look
so
miserable
and
especially
away
from
the
thin
pale
man
who
was
now
staring
at
him
as
intently
as
a
hunter
with
drawn
bow
watches
a
stag
and
yet
the
pale
eyes
stranger
had
been
part
of
the
vision
that
had
given
white
bear
his
new
name
and
put
him
on
the
path
to
becoming
a
shaman
must
be
a
good
man
if
he
appeared
to
me
with
the
white
bear
and
the
turtle
and
he
must
be
important
to
sit
here
white
bear
said
owl
carver
and
white
bear
walked
slowly
toward
him
owl
carver
gestured
that
he
was
to
sit
beside
the
pale
eyes
white
bear
felt
his
heart
fluttering
as
he
sat
down
owl
carver
pointed
to
a
place
beside
himself
for
sun
woman
the
four
formed
a
semicircle
backs
to
the
medicine
lodge
faces
toward
the
crowd
of
curious
people
as
was
the
way
of
the
sauk
the
four
sat
for
a
long
time
with
no
one
speaking
white
bear
body
grew
colder
and
colder
and
he
had
to
fight
to
keep
from
trembling
after
a
time
white
bear
turned
to
the
stranger
and
saw
in
the
gaunt
face
a
mixture
of
pain
and
joy
the
man
pupils
were
a
strange
almost
frightening
color
from
such
eyes
white
bear
knew
the
sauk
took
their
name
for
this
man
people
as
the
man
looked
at
white
bear
and
then
over
at
sun
woman
it
seemed
that
his
heart
was
glowing
with
happiness
but
it
was
a
happiness
tinged
by
regret
the
glow
of
a
setting
sun
white
bear
inner
sense
told
him
that
something
was
hurting
more
than
the
pale
eye
spirit
was
draining
his
life
away
white
bear
wished
at
once
that
he
could
work
a
healing
of
this
good
man
body
but
why
was
sun
woman
so
unhappy
and
why
was
redbird
frightened
owl
carver
whispered
to
a
small
boy
who
stood
beside
him
the
boy
ran
off
now
the
shaman
sat
nodding
his
head
slowly
white
bear
could
see
that
owl
carver
stood
at
the
branching
of
several
paths
and
was
trying
to
decide
which
one
to
take
white
bear
fear
grew
owl
carver
turned
to
white
bear
this
man
is
your
father
taught
by
owl
carver
that
rather
than
puzzle
over
a
vision
it
is
best
to
let
it
reveal
its
meaning
in
its
own
time
white
bear
had
chosen
months
ago
not
to
ponder
who
the
pale
eyes
in
the
turtle
lodge
might
be
owl
carver
must
have
known
when
white
bear
described
the
vision
to
him
but
thought
it
better
not
to
tell
him
white
bear
turned
and
looked
again
at
the
man
seated
beside
him
who
raised
his
arms
tentatively
as
if
he
wanted
to
reach
out
to
him
white
bear
kept
his
hands
in
his
lap
and
the
man
lowered
his
arms
again
white
bear
felt
a
strangeness
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
this
man
looked
at
him
with
love
he
was
certain
now
that
because
this
man
had
come
today
everything
was
going
to
be
changed
your
father
is
called
star
arrow
said
owl
carver
he
turned
to
star
arrow
and
said
your
son
is
called
white
bear
i
greet
you
white
bear
star
arrow
said
white
bear
was
glad
to
hear
this
man
speaking
the
sauk
language
i
greet
you
star
arrow
my
father
white
bear
said
the
word
felt
strange
on
his
tongue
he
liked
that
name
and
wondered
what
it
meant
a
shiver
of
joy
went
through
him
he
spoke
in
the
english
père
isaac
had
taught
him
good
day
to
you
father
my
son
said
star
arrow
in
the
same
tongue
white
bear
saw
now
that
tears
were
running
down
his
father
face
just
as
they
had
in
the
vision
he
heard
a
commotion
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
people
were
stepping
aside
a
thrill
went
through
white
bear
as
he
saw
that
black
hawk
was
coming
toward
them
the
leader
careworn
face
glowed
as
if
he
were
seeing
a
brother
he
shifted
his
war
club
to
his
left
hand
and
raised
his
empty
right
hand
in
greeting
to
star
arrow
white
bear
was
amazed
he
could
not
remember
seeing
black
hawk
smile
so
happily
star
arrow
raised
his
hand
in
reply
white
bear
felt
himself
surrounded
by
giants
black
hawk
star
arrow
owl
carver
he
remembered
the
circle
of
trees
he
had
been
standing
in
when
sun
woman
called
to
him
star
arrow
has
come
back
to
us
black
hawk
declared
it
is
well
wolf
paw
black
hawk
oldest
son
now
strode
down
the
line
of
people
his
presence
as
always
made
white
bear
uneasy
sun
woman
made
room
for
black
hawk
to
sit
beside
owl
carver
the
chief
handed
his
feathered
war
club
to
wolf
paw
who
sat
down
behind
him
and
rested
the
club
across
his
knees
three
more
men
pushed
their
way
through
the
crowd
when
they
came
to
the
front
white
bear
saw
that
they
were
three
chiefs
members
of
the
council
that
ruled
the
affairs
of
the
sauk
and
fox
in
peacetime
one
jumping
fish
was
older
than
black
hawk
another
broth
was
a
man
and
a
orator
the
third
little
stabbing
chief
was
a
prominent
member
of
the
fox
tribe
with
a
courteous
gesture
black
hawk
invited
the
three
chiefs
to
join
the
sitting
circle
the
nine
sat
quietly
for
a
time
before
their
people
while
a
breeze
whistled
over
the
bark
rooftops
of
saukenuk
black
hawk
broke
the
silence
our
fathers
and
our
grandfathers
have
known
many
kinds
of
pale
eyes
the
french
pale
eyes
traded
with
us
the
british
pale
eyes
made
us
their
allies
in
war
but
the
american
pale
eyes
drive
us
from
our
land
and
kill
us
when
we
resist
american
pale
eyes
are
not
our
friends
but
this
man
star
arrow
we
call
friend
we
trust
star
arrow
thirteen
summers
ago
the
british
long
knives
made
war
on
the
american
long
knives
the
great
shawnee
chief
shooting
star
led
braves
and
warriors
of
many
tribes
to
fight
on
the
side
of
the
british
against
the
americans
we
among
the
sauk
and
foxes
who
followed
shooting
star
have
been
known
ever
since
as
the
british
band
this
man
was
living
among
us
then
seeking
to
trade
with
us
and
to
know
us
better
when
the
war
began
there
were
some
who
said
is
an
enemy
kill
him
and
i
might
have
said
so
too
but
i
did
not
because
already
i
knew
that
he
was
a
good
man
we
could
not
send
him
back
to
the
americans
but
we
let
him
live
among
us
we
even
let
him
share
the
bed
of
sun
woman
after
the
war
when
star
arrow
went
back
to
his
own
people
he
left
with
us
this
boy
white
bear
black
hawk
turned
to
white
bear
and
when
their
eyes
met
white
bear
trembled
under
black
hawk
gaze
the
eyes
were
infinitely
black
like
a
night
without
stars
he
left
us
another
gift
black
hawk
said
he
reached
into
a
beaded
bag
hanging
at
his
belt
he
took
out
a
shining
metal
disk
on
a
thin
silvery
chain
and
held
it
up
so
that
the
people
could
see
it
inside
this
disk
of
metal
there
is
an
arrow
that
points
always
to
the
north
even
on
a
day
when
i
can
not
see
the
sun
on
a
night
when
i
can
not
see
the
stars
i
know
where
the
sun
should
be
and
i
know
where
the
council
fire
star
is
the
star
that
does
not
move
all
night
long
he
gave
us
this
magical
gift
and
so
we
give
him
his
name
among
the
sauk
star
arrow
his
heart
is
as
constant
as
the
council
fire
star
and
as
true
as
the
arrow
there
was
a
murmur
of
assent
among
the
people
black
hawk
raised
his
hand
let
star
arrow
now
tell
us
why
he
comes
back
black
hawk
folded
his
arms
white
bear
his
heart
beating
as
hard
as
a
drum
in
a
dance
turned
to
the
pale
eyes
star
arrow
turned
his
own
head
to
look
long
and
gravely
at
sun
woman
then
at
white
bear
star
arrow
said
chief
black
hawk
i
lived
with
sun
woman
as
her
husband
and
then
i
left
her
with
a
son
this
young
man
white
bear
i
wronged
sun
woman
and
white
bear
he
should
have
had
a
father
as
well
as
a
mother
i
went
back
to
my
people
and
married
a
pale
eyes
woman
earthmaker
has
punished
me
by
giving
me
no
children
by
my
second
wife
and
at
last
taking
her
from
me
because
of
this
my
heart
is
like
the
ashes
of
an
old
fire
he
held
out
his
arms
toward
sun
woman
now
i
want
to
make
it
right
owl
carver
leaned
forward
into
the
circle
of
speakers
you
want
to
come
and
live
with
us
again
star
arrow
at
the
thought
of
star
arrow
returning
to
the
band
white
bear
heart
leaped
with
happiness
all
his
life
he
had
been
hoping
to
meet
his
father
waiting
for
his
father
return
but
never
believing
it
possible
so
that
his
father
returning
might
be
pleased
with
him
he
had
even
let
père
isaac
teach
him
things
he
could
never
use
to
have
this
strange
new
man
who
was
so
respected
by
the
sauk
living
with
him
and
sun
woman
this
was
almost
as
thrilling
a
prospect
as
his
dream
of
becoming
a
great
shaman
star
arrow
said
no
i
can
not
stay
among
you
nothing
i
think
would
make
me
happier
but
i
have
many
things
to
do
among
my
own
people
i
own
much
land
owl
carver
said
if
your
land
keeps
you
from
doing
what
you
want
then
it
owns
star
arrow
smiled
ruefully
owl
carver
speaks
truly
but
i
can
not
change
this
i
must
care
for
my
land
myself
because
there
is
no
one
who
can
do
it
for
me
star
arrow
turned
to
look
at
white
bear
who
sensed
a
question
you
be
one
who
helps
me
care
for
my
land
again
white
bear
felt
the
presence
of
a
that
had
its
grip
on
star
arrow
body
he
must
speak
to
owl
carver
perhaps
owl
carver
could
tell
him
how
to
help
his
father
owl
carver
said
we
know
about
your
land
star
arrow
you
traded
honorably
with
us
and
gave
us
many
valuable
goods
so
that
you
and
your
family
could
live
on
that
land
to
the
north
and
farm
it
and
graze
your
animals
on
it
that
is
so
said
chief
jumping
fish
star
arrow
gave
me
a
fine
rifle
and
he
made
our
tribe
rich
with
what
he
paid
us
white
bear
felt
a
chill
of
fear
when
he
heard
that
star
arrow
lived
to
the
north
there
was
danger
it
seemed
in
the
north
three
fox
men
including
sun
fish
a
youth
his
own
age
who
had
been
a
playmate
of
his
had
gone
north
two
moons
ago
to
work
a
lead
mine
and
had
not
been
heard
from
star
arrow
said
i
have
come
to
ask
sun
woman
and
white
bear
to
live
with
me
in
my
home
white
bear
heard
an
amazed
murmur
from
the
crowd
and
he
himself
felt
his
heart
drop
as
if
he
plummeted
unaware
into
a
deep
pit
leave
the
tribe
he
could
not
picture
it
it
made
no
sense
being
without
the
tribe
would
be
like
trying
to
live
without
his
arms
or
legs
white
bear
eyes
met
redbird
her
slanting
eyes
were
big
with
fear
and
he
tried
to
tell
her
with
a
look
that
he
did
not
want
this
now
he
understood
why
she
looked
so
unhappy
she
must
have
guessed
what
star
arrow
would
ask
to
leave
redbird
no
longer
to
learn
from
owl
carver
give
up
hope
of
being
a
shaman
leave
the
forest
leave
saukenuk
he
had
heard
that
no
spirits
lived
among
the
pale
eyes
in
the
land
of
the
pale
eyes
the
tall
prairie
grass
was
burned
away
and
the
trees
were
cut
down
black
hawk
and
owl
carver
looked
at
each
other
in
the
glances
that
passed
between
them
white
bear
saw
surprise
questioning
but
no
disapproval
he
felt
his
hopes
sink
would
he
have
to
fight
this
fight
alone
no
his
mother
would
say
no
to
star
arrow
she
stood
up
to
speak
tall
and
stately
she
turned
to
star
arrow
and
white
bear
saw
love
mingle
with
the
pain
in
her
dark
brown
eyes
i
am
happy
to
call
star
arrow
husband
he
has
not
wronged
me
it
is
right
that
a
man
should
live
among
his
people
white
bear
thought
she
will
say
that
we
must
stay
with
our
people
and
can
not
go
with
i
am
glad
that
star
arrow
remembers
me
and
white
bear
that
he
comes
to
ask
us
to
live
with
him
but
i
can
not
go
i
have
my
work
the
gathering
of
medicines
the
healing
the
teaching
of
what
i
know
she
turned
to
redbird
who
smiled
uncertainly
sun
woman
spoke
on
i
could
not
look
into
pale
eyes
faces
all
day
long
my
heart
would
dry
up
in
the
long
silence
that
followed
white
bear
waited
uneasily
why
had
his
mother
not
spoken
of
him
star
arrow
unfolded
his
long
thin
limbs
went
over
and
stood
before
sun
woman
he
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
a
sudden
breeze
rattled
the
bark
walls
of
saukenuk
i
understand
what
sun
woman
says
sun
woman
and
star
arrow
both
looked
at
white
bear
he
felt
as
if
the
ground
were
trembling
under
him
he
wished
it
would
open
up
and
swallow
him
this
young
man
said
sun
woman
your
son
white
bear
half
of
him
is
you
it
is
right
that
he
should
see
the
pale
eyes
who
are
also
his
people
the
earth
was
tilting
white
bear
was
falling
his
own
mother
betraying
him
sending
him
away
i
have
always
believed
that
earthmaker
meant
some
special
destiny
for
white
bear
sun
woman
said
the
shout
burst
from
white
bear
no
he
did
not
even
remember
getting
to
his
feet
but
he
was
standing
heads
turned
toward
him
eyes
opened
wide
he
saw
black
hawk
lift
a
hand
to
silence
him
then
lower
it
again
the
three
chiefs
stared
angrily
words
tumbled
out
of
him
he
spoke
to
his
mother
who
had
turned
against
him
earthmaker
meant
me
to
be
a
shaman
how
can
i
learn
to
be
a
shaman
if
i
live
among
pale
eyes
if
i
spend
many
summers
and
winters
away
from
the
tribe
i
will
no
longer
be
a
sauk
white
bear
could
see
the
lines
in
sun
woman
face
this
was
hurting
her
he
knew
that
but
his
anger
at
her
burned
in
his
chest
she
was
trading
his
life
for
hers
she
would
stay
here
in
saukenuk
but
she
would
give
star
arrow
part
of
what
he
wanted
his
son
why
should
he
be
sacrificed
to
make
star
arrow
happy
it
was
she
who
had
chosen
to
take
this
pale
eyes
into
her
lodge
sun
woman
turned
to
owl
carver
we
need
to
learn
much
more
about
the
pale
eyes
if
we
are
to
protect
ourselves
from
them
some
of
us
must
live
with
them
and
come
to
understand
them
from
within
their
tribe
such
a
one
must
be
young
enough
to
learn
new
ways
and
he
should
be
specially
gifted
a
favorite
of
the
spirits
then
owl
carver
stood
up
to
speak
facing
white
bear
white
bear
listen
to
the
words
of
your
teacher
there
is
more
than
one
way
to
become
a
shaman
here
in
saukenuk
live
many
people
of
the
fox
and
some
of
the
winnebago
piankeshaw
and
kickapoo
tribes
who
says
their
lives
are
over
because
they
live
among
the
sauk
if
you
live
with
the
tribe
of
pale
eyes
it
will
make
you
a
man
of
greater
knowledge
to
go
among
them
will
take
the
courage
of
a
warrior
and
more
of
knowledge
of
courage
is
a
shaman
made
owl
carver
turned
to
black
hawk
sun
woman
is
right
let
the
boy
go
with
star
arrow
i
know
earthmaker
has
blazed
this
trail
for
white
bear
he
crossed
his
arms
before
his
chest
and
sat
down
again
white
bear
cast
about
desperately
for
words
that
would
answer
owl
carver
he
felt
helpless
to
fight
the
current
that
was
sweeping
him
away
if
earthmaker
wants
this
for
me
how
is
it
that
do
not
know
it
he
cried
he
went
cold
inside
realizing
that
in
his
desperation
he
was
defying
owl
carver
before
all
the
people
he
was
questioning
owl
carver
powers
he
wanted
to
say
that
he
hoped
to
be
the
great
prophet
of
the
sauk
after
owl
carver
had
departed
to
the
land
of
the
spirits
but
he
did
not
dare
say
such
a
thing
earthmaker
himself
might
punish
him
for
such
presumption
did
i
not
come
back
to
you
from
the
sacred
cave
with
the
very
words
of
the
turtle
he
said
holding
his
hands
out
in
appeal
surely
i
will
bring
you
other
great
visions
if
i
stay
with
you
among
the
sauk
i
have
grown
to
manhood
why
does
this
man
come
now
to
tear
me
away
from
the
only
tribe
i
have
known
he
was
surprised
to
see
star
arrow
smile
warmly
at
him
this
man
is
your
father
owl
carver
declared
you
are
a
sauk
a
sauk
never
shirks
the
demands
of
honor
a
sauk
is
loyal
and
respectful
and
obedient
toward
his
father
i
am
proud
of
my
son
said
star
arrow
he
speaks
with
power
before
the
people
at
that
a
hopeless
feeling
swept
over
white
bear
star
arrow
was
not
fighting
him
any
more
than
water
fights
a
drowning
man
star
arrow
was
a
current
dragging
him
away
from
his
people
his
village
and
the
village
was
not
trying
to
hold
him
sun
woman
owl
carver
black
hawk
were
pushing
him
out
as
they
would
a
man
who
was
so
wicked
he
could
not
be
allowed
to
live
with
the
people
he
felt
utterly
alone
what
did
he
know
of
the
pale
eyes
only
the
little
that
père
isaac
had
taught
him
and
that
they
were
great
land
thieves
always
they
were
scheming
to
take
land
away
from
the
people
who
had
held
it
since
the
great
river
first
began
to
flow
from
the
turtle
breast
why
must
he
live
among
his
people
enemies
owl
carver
sprang
from
his
seat
he
leaped
at
white
bear
and
crouched
before
him
his
eyes
opened
wide
as
those
of
his
totem
bird
white
bear
felt
himself
pulled
toward
their
black
centers
as
if
they
were
whirlpools
in
the
great
river
owl
carver
long
white
hair
fanned
out
like
wings
on
either
side
of
his
head
will
listen
owl
carver
said
in
a
soft
voice
of
terrible
intensity
will
hear
silently
white
bear
stood
looking
at
the
shaman
you
are
the
son
of
my
spirit
as
much
as
you
are
the
son
of
star
body
i
tell
you
to
live
with
this
man
as
i
told
you
to
go
to
the
sacred
cave
in
the
moon
of
ice
this
is
a
far
greater
test
for
you
going
to
live
with
the
pale
eyes
will
be
like
journeying
to
another
sacred
cave
and
you
will
bring
back
other
visions
white
bear
saw
in
the
blackness
of
owl
carver
eyes
that
if
he
defied
this
decision
he
would
lose
his
place
in
the
tribe
there
was
no
way
to
break
free
from
the
current
that
was
sweeping
him
away
from
saukenuk
white
bear
felt
as
if
something
in
him
had
broken
he
held
his
face
expressionless
he
did
not
want
to
show
his
hurt
before
the
tribe
but
he
knew
he
would
soon
be
unable
to
stop
himself
from
weeping
among
the
witnessing
people
he
saw
anguish
and
determination
struggling
in
sun
woman
face
others
looked
at
him
only
with
curiosity
not
sympathy
in
all
the
people
around
him
the
only
face
that
shared
his
unrelieved
wretchedness
was
redbird
his
gaze
met
hers
and
the
pain
they
felt
together
deepened
his
despair
black
hawk
spoke
in
a
low
voice
over
his
shoulder
to
wolf
paw
who
stood
up
as
he
left
the
circle
before
owl
carver
medicine
lodge
wolf
paw
glanced
at
white
bear
and
white
bear
saw
the
light
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
black
hawk
held
a
hand
out
to
star
arrow
if
we
let
you
take
white
bear
you
must
one
day
let
him
return
to
us
bringing
his
new
knowledge
to
help
the
sauk
owl
carver
moved
from
his
crouching
position
before
white
bear
and
sat
down
again
facing
star
arrow
this
young
man
is
most
precious
to
us
the
mysteries
have
been
told
to
him
and
he
has
seen
visions
of
the
past
and
future
at
this
white
bear
heart
was
eased
a
bit
the
tribe
did
want
him
to
return
am
both
red
and
and
both
his
tribe
and
the
pale
eyes
wanted
him
go
among
the
pale
eyes
will
make
you
a
man
of
owl
carver
had
said
and
black
hawk
had
agreed
perhaps
he
could
become
a
star
arrow
pointing
the
way
for
his
people
in
the
troubled
days
the
turtle
had
foretold
i
promise
to
keep
him
with
me
only
for
a
time
said
star
arrow
has
not
long
to
live
that
is
why
he
can
and
that
meant
that
white
bear
time
of
exile
from
the
sauk
would
be
short
but
knowing
that
brought
white
bear
no
relief
he
did
not
want
his
father
whom
he
had
just
met
to
die
so
soon
i
ask
one
more
thing
said
star
arrow
it
will
be
harder
for
the
boy
to
learn
the
ways
of
the
pale
eyes
if
he
always
feels
the
pull
of
his
sauk
people
for
the
first
few
summers
and
winters
that
he
is
with
us
i
ask
that
he
not
return
to
you
even
for
a
visit
and
that
you
send
no
messages
to
him
and
he
send
none
to
you
that
is
much
to
ask
said
owl
carver
that
is
hard
the
boy
may
die
of
longing
for
his
people
star
arrow
shook
his
head
i
would
never
let
that
happen
if
i
see
that
it
is
unbearable
for
him
i
will
send
him
back
to
you
but
i
will
do
everything
i
can
to
make
him
happy
and
if
he
does
not
see
the
british
band
or
hear
from
them
the
pain
of
parting
will
go
away
sooner
i
understand
what
star
arrow
says
said
black
hawk
it
is
granted
white
bear
sat
down
slowly
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
mortally
wounded
never
to
have
a
word
from
his
mother
or
from
redbird
how
could
he
bear
it
star
arrow
continued
he
will
go
to
a
fine
school
in
the
east
and
when
he
has
learned
all
he
can
learn
i
will
send
him
back
to
you
let
it
be
done
black
hawk
said
wolf
paw
came
through
the
crowd
holding
up
in
both
hands
a
calumet
a
sacred
pipe
its
hickory
stem
was
as
long
as
a
man
arm
wrapped
in
blue
and
yellow
bands
and
its
high
slender
bowl
was
of
dark
red
pipestone
quarried
in
a
valley
far
to
the
west
black
hawk
took
the
pipe
from
wolf
paw
and
filled
the
bowl
with
tobacco
from
a
beaded
pouch
at
his
waist
owl
carver
went
into
his
lodge
and
brought
back
a
burning
twig
that
black
hawk
used
to
light
the
pipe
black
hawk
said
by
the
smoking
of
the
sacred
tobacco
let
all
these
promises
be
sealed
white
bear
went
cold
as
he
saw
the
light
gray
smoke
curl
up
from
black
hawk
pipe
and
smelled
its
sweet
scent
once
he
put
the
pipe
to
his
lips
and
drew
the
smoke
into
his
mouth
he
would
be
bound
to
go
with
star
arrow
as
firmly
as
he
was
bound
to
the
sauk
tribe
holding
the
pipestem
with
one
hand
in
the
middle
and
the
other
at
the
end
black
hawk
ceremoniously
drew
on
the
pipe
and
let
a
cloud
of
smoke
out
of
his
mouth
he
handed
the
pipe
to
star
arrow
who
fixed
his
gaze
on
white
bear
and
did
the
same
next
the
pipe
went
to
owl
carver
who
took
the
single
puff
that
bound
him
to
the
agreement
owl
carver
took
the
pipe
in
turn
to
jumping
fish
broth
and
little
stabbing
chief
each
puffed
on
it
bearing
witness
then
owl
carver
walked
over
to
white
bear
and
handed
him
the
pipe
trembling
with
fear
that
what
he
was
about
to
do
might
be
the
ruin
of
him
white
bear
took
the
pipe
in
his
hands
his
fingers
felt
the
ridged
wrappings
and
the
smooth
warm
stone
of
the
bowl
he
had
never
smoked
a
sacred
pipe
before
he
could
hand
the
pipe
back
to
owl
carver
and
refuse
but
he
knew
that
this
had
gone
so
far
that
if
he
did
that
not
only
would
he
never
be
accepted
as
a
shaman
he
might
not
even
be
accepted
as
a
sauk
he
wanted
to
look
at
redbird
but
he
dared
not
he
looked
instead
at
sun
woman
and
saw
her
eyes
warm
with
the
wish
that
he
would
smoke
the
pipe
he
put
the
calumet
to
his
lips
and
pulled
the
hot
smoke
into
his
mouth
it
burned
his
tongue
and
the
insides
of
his
cheeks
he
took
the
pipe
away
and
held
the
smoke
for
a
moment
then
puffed
it
out
as
he
did
so
a
sigh
went
up
from
the
watchers
black
hawk
was
standing
before
him
white
bear
handed
the
pipe
up
to
him
may
you
walk
this
path
on
which
we
send
you
with
courage
and
honor
black
hawk
said
he
turned
to
the
people
this
council
is
at
an
end
white
bear
knew
he
could
not
hold
back
his
tears
any
longer
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
blindly
hurled
himself
into
the
crowd
that
was
already
beginning
to
disperse
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
arm
but
he
pulled
away
from
it
he
began
to
run
he
ran
through
saukenuk
through
the
meadow
into
the
trees
by
the
river
edge
he
ran
past
the
graves
he
ran
with
the
hard
steady
stride
of
one
carrying
a
message
but
a
messenger
did
not
run
sobbing
with
tears
streaming
down
his
face
in
the
ancient
grove
redbird
watched
an
aching
empty
place
in
her
chest
as
white
bear
disappeared
into
the
woods
at
the
edge
of
the
rock
river
what
a
fool
water
flows
fast
standing
nearby
had
spoken
the
pale
eyes
have
steel
knives
and
blankets
and
big
sturdy
lodges
that
are
always
warm
and
never
leak
they
always
have
enough
food
i
would
be
happy
to
go
live
with
a
pale
eyes
if
he
asked
me
is
your
prattling
tongue
never
still
woman
said
her
husband
three
horses
it
was
my
prattling
tongue
that
agreed
to
marry
you
redbird
had
no
heart
to
listen
to
them
bicker
let
me
through
she
cried
and
the
crowd
parted
before
her
where
are
you
going
cried
her
mother
it
is
shameful
to
run
after
him
she
grabbed
redbird
sleeve
all
the
people
will
laugh
at
you
let
me
go
as
wind
bends
grass
pulled
at
her
redbird
eyes
met
those
of
wolf
paw
standing
beside
his
father
the
war
chief
he
glared
at
her
she
knew
he
too
wanted
to
tell
her
not
to
run
after
white
bear
but
if
he
showed
that
he
cared
that
much
the
people
would
make
fun
of
she
turned
her
back
on
all
of
them
wind
bends
grass
wolf
paw
black
hawk
owl
carver
and
began
to
run
when
she
reached
the
riverbank
she
saw
no
sign
of
him
for
one
moment
she
thought
he
throw
himself
into
the
river
then
downriver
she
saw
a
canoe
gliding
over
the
glistening
water
he
was
paddling
hard
and
was
almost
out
of
sight
around
a
bend
her
own
small
bark
canoe
on
which
she
had
painted
a
bird
wing
in
red
lay
a
short
distance
down
the
riverbank
she
pushed
it
into
the
water
jumped
into
the
rear
and
seated
herself
in
the
middle
the
bottom
scraped
over
the
riverbank
as
she
pushed
off
with
her
paddle
she
stayed
a
distance
behind
white
bear
just
close
enough
to
keep
him
in
sight
he
might
not
want
her
to
follow
him
she
could
not
guess
what
was
in
his
mind
right
now
what
would
she
do
when
she
caught
up
with
him
she
had
hoped
to
marry
him
if
not
this
summer
then
the
next
ever
since
she
was
a
small
child
she
had
found
him
endlessly
fascinating
more
so
than
ever
since
his
return
from
his
spirit
journey
nothing
she
thought
would
make
her
happier
than
living
with
him
sun
woman
had
told
her
all
about
what
happens
when
a
man
and
a
woman
lie
down
together
knowledge
that
wind
bends
grass
had
insisted
that
she
did
not
yet
need
it
sounded
painful
pleasurable
frightening
and
exciting
she
had
looked
forward
to
lying
down
with
white
bear
but
now
she
was
going
to
lose
him
how
could
sun
woman
send
her
own
son
away
from
the
tribe
send
him
away
from
redbird
felt
more
hurt
than
if
her
own
mother
had
turned
against
her
and
did
white
bear
truly
mean
to
go
with
the
pale
eyes
he
had
smoked
the
calumet
he
must
the
current
carried
her
canoe
through
the
water
brown
with
silt
caught
up
in
spring
flooding
almost
faster
than
she
could
paddle
ahead
the
river
divided
flowing
around
an
island
near
the
right
bank
thick
with
trees
white
bear
turned
into
the
narrow
channel
that
ran
between
island
and
shore
and
she
backpaddled
to
slow
herself
and
watch
his
canoe
rounded
a
huge
fallen
tree
whose
exposed
roots
clutched
at
the
island
shore
like
the
fingers
of
a
drowning
man
and
disappeared
behind
the
trunk
she
let
her
paddle
drag
in
the
water
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
holding
her
canoe
back
until
he
had
time
to
land
then
she
glided
into
the
narrow
channel
and
around
the
dead
tree
he
had
drawn
his
canoe
up
in
a
small
sandy
cove
and
was
gone
she
landed
on
the
patch
of
sand
beside
his
canoe
and
pulled
her
canoe
partway
out
of
the
water
she
listened
and
for
a
moment
heard
nothing
but
the
wind
in
the
trees
a
redbird
her
namesake
trilled
long
and
loud
and
another
answered
from
a
more
distant
tree
then
she
heard
a
human
voice
no
words
just
an
outcry
a
cry
of
pain
she
plunged
into
the
forest
that
covered
the
island
pushing
her
way
through
the
shrubbery
toward
the
sound
of
his
voice
he
was
sobbing
so
loudly
that
she
was
sure
he
could
not
hear
her
coming
she
had
heard
a
man
sob
like
that
once
before
a
dying
hunter
whose
leg
had
been
torn
to
shreds
by
a
bear
she
moved
through
some
trees
and
saw
him
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
against
the
big
black
trunk
of
an
oak
he
was
in
a
grove
of
trees
so
big
and
so
old
that
little
grew
in
their
heavy
shade
and
there
was
an
open
place
to
sit
the
season
was
so
young
that
their
branches
were
still
almost
bare
and
she
could
see
white
bear
clearly
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
he
held
a
severed
tree
branch
in
his
lap
his
eyes
were
squeezed
shut
and
his
lips
were
drawn
back
from
his
teeth
and
his
cries
of
pain
came
one
after
another
she
stepped
out
of
the
bushes
into
the
grove
he
looked
up
and
the
face
he
showed
her
was
so
twisted
that
she
could
not
tell
whether
he
saw
her
he
went
on
sobbing
hoarsely
her
heart
hurt
to
see
him
suffer
so
she
sat
down
beside
him
for
a
long
time
she
listened
to
him
weep
waiting
for
a
chance
to
speak
to
him
she
looked
at
the
branch
he
was
holding
it
was
almost
as
long
as
her
arm
and
surprisingly
it
had
leaves
at
its
tip
even
though
this
was
only
the
moon
of
buds
he
clutched
it
as
a
child
clutches
a
doll
for
comfort
gradually
his
weeping
subsided
she
reached
out
very
carefully
and
patted
his
shoulder
lightly
when
he
did
not
pull
away
she
rested
her
hand
on
him
she
eased
herself
closer
until
they
were
pressed
together
side
by
side
and
she
slid
her
arm
around
his
shoulders
and
held
him
tightly
at
first
she
felt
no
answering
movement
he
seemed
only
half
alive
she
wondered
if
he
knew
she
was
here
then
his
head
dropped
to
her
shoulder
she
felt
the
weight
of
his
body
yielding
to
her
she
put
her
other
arm
around
him
she
held
him
as
if
he
were
her
child
in
spite
of
his
sorrow
and
her
own
it
was
a
great
happiness
to
hold
him
like
this
he
sighed
and
wiped
his
face
with
his
hand
she
stroked
his
cheek
brushing
away
the
tears
she
wanted
to
talk
to
him
but
waited
for
him
to
speak
first
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
he
said
i
must
go
with
star
arrow
my
father
she
studied
his
face
as
he
stared
off
into
the
forest
she
could
see
now
the
features
of
his
father
in
him
there
had
always
been
something
odd
about
his
eyes
but
she
had
never
been
quite
able
to
decide
what
it
was
now
she
saw
that
they
were
rounder
than
most
people
they
were
shaped
like
his
father
his
nose
was
thin
and
bony
with
a
high
arch
and
sharp
at
the
end
like
the
beak
of
a
bird
his
eyebrows
were
thick
black
and
straight
across
his
chin
was
pointed
she
loved
the
strangeness
of
his
face
she
said
when
it
gets
dark
we
could
go
back
to
the
village
and
fill
our
canoes
with
food
and
blankets
and
tools
and
weapons
there
will
be
feasting
tonight
for
star
arrow
everyone
will
sleep
soundly
after
that
we
could
cross
the
great
river
tonight
and
tomorrow
we
could
be
far
away
he
stared
at
her
but
i
do
not
to
leave
my
people
she
had
not
thought
that
far
ahead
about
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
away
from
owl
carver
iron
knife
sun
woman
her
sisters
her
mother
all
the
others
yes
it
would
be
a
great
loss
but
she
could
stand
the
pain
she
thought
if
she
were
beside
white
bear
but
we
would
have
each
other
would
it
not
hurt
you
less
if
you
had
me
with
you
he
did
not
answer
at
once
and
that
made
her
feel
as
if
a
rough
hand
had
squeezed
her
heart
but
then
he
smiled
at
her
and
she
felt
better
yes
if
i
could
share
my
life
with
you
the
pain
of
leaving
saukenuk
would
be
less
then
his
face
darkened
but
we
could
not
live
on
our
own
a
man
or
a
woman
cut
off
from
their
tribe
can
no
more
be
happy
than
a
flower
after
it
is
picked
can
continue
to
grow
and
i
would
have
dishonored
the
promise
i
made
with
the
sacred
tobacco
the
spirits
would
turn
their
backs
on
me
my
mother
and
owl
carver
say
that
if
i
go
with
star
arrow
i
may
learn
things
that
would
help
our
people
she
was
thunderstruck
to
realize
that
he
actually
wanted
to
go
with
star
arrow
then
what
was
all
this
weeping
for
he
did
not
care
for
her
as
much
as
she
did
for
him
that
made
her
angry
she
pushed
herself
a
little
apart
from
him
i
see
that
i
have
been
a
fool
to
chase
after
you
just
as
my
mother
said
it
means
more
to
you
to
go
and
live
with
the
pale
eyes
than
it
does
to
have
redbird
as
your
woman
his
eyes
widened
we
have
never
before
today
spoken
of
this
you
and
i
did
we
have
to
speak
she
felt
herself
getting
angrier
and
angrier
why
do
you
think
i
went
looking
for
you
when
you
went
on
your
vision
quest
why
do
you
think
i
followed
you
from
the
village
today
and
why
did
i
say
i
would
go
with
you
across
the
great
river
yes
i
did
want
to
be
your
woman
but
you
do
not
want
me
you
want
to
go
away
with
this
pale
eyes
father
of
yours
and
maybe
you
want
to
take
a
pale
eyes
woman
for
yourself
his
mouth
as
well
as
his
eyes
opened
up
in
amazement
i
have
never
even
seen
a
pale
eyes
woman
how
could
i
want
one
i
do
want
redbird
to
be
my
woman
and
i
weep
at
leaving
saukenuk
because
i
must
leave
you
again
she
reached
out
to
him
putting
her
hands
on
his
arms
i
would
rather
be
cast
out
of
our
tribe
than
lose
you
he
shook
his
head
we
do
not
have
to
lose
our
people
or
each
other
it
was
part
of
the
promise
sealed
with
sacred
tobacco
that
i
am
to
come
back
if
we
ran
away
now
earthmaker
would
be
angry
with
us
she
moved
closer
to
him
she
had
seen
earthmaker
in
dreams
he
was
taller
than
the
tallest
tree
and
he
carried
a
great
war
club
with
a
rock
at
the
end
of
it
and
looked
much
like
black
hawk
with
a
long
black
lock
of
hair
coiling
down
from
the
top
of
a
shaved
head
i
wish
i
could
meet
and
talk
with
the
spirits
as
you
have
she
said
sometimes
i
think
i
do
meet
them
in
dreams
it
can
be
dangerous
to
meet
with
the
spirits
he
said
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
looking
into
the
distance
he
had
seen
so
many
things
she
had
not
it
was
unfair
she
thought
sadly
she
had
gone
out
to
him
in
the
bitter
cold
when
the
world
was
an
endless
white
waste
she
might
have
frozen
to
death
she
might
have
been
punished
by
drowning
in
the
icy
river
she
had
risked
almost
as
much
as
he
had
i
do
not
say
that
i
am
as
strong
as
white
bear
or
as
worthy
to
speak
with
the
spirits
she
said
i
only
wish
i
had
a
chance
to
he
took
her
hands
in
his
and
looked
deep
into
her
eyes
the
real
danger
of
a
shaman
vision
is
not
to
the
body
what
is
the
real
danger
i
did
not
want
to
come
back
she
felt
a
cold
wind
blowing
across
her
neck
as
if
spirits
had
quietly
entered
this
grove
with
them
and
were
standing
about
them
listening
to
them
judging
them
it
is
so
wondrous
he
said
in
a
voice
so
low
she
had
to
strain
to
hear
it
over
the
wind
whispering
in
the
tree
branches
you
are
there
with
them
the
white
bear
the
turtle
you
see
them
talk
to
them
you
see
the
tree
of
life
the
crystal
lodge
of
the
turtle
and
the
spirits
of
all
living
things
why
would
anyone
want
to
return
redbird
shivered
but
she
still
envied
him
your
hands
are
cold
white
bear
said
and
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
drew
her
close
to
nestle
on
his
chest
she
slid
her
hands
under
the
leather
vest
he
wore
and
felt
the
smooth
warmth
of
his
skin
and
the
firmness
of
his
muscles
how
powerful
his
arms
were
around
her
she
thanked
earthmaker
that
white
bear
had
found
the
inner
strength
to
return
from
that
other
land
a
new
thought
occurred
to
her
what
if
you
find
that
the
land
of
the
pale
eyes
holds
you
fast
then
you
will
never
come
back
to
me
and
to
the
sauk
you
will
be
dead
he
smiled
gently
and
patted
her
shoulder
she
pulled
herself
closer
to
him
can
the
land
of
the
pale
eyes
altogether
without
spirits
hold
me
when
the
spirits
themselves
could
not
i
do
not
think
so
can
the
land
of
the
pale
eyes
hold
me
when
redbird
is
not
in
it
do
not
think
so
her
body
seemed
to
be
melting
she
wanted
to
flow
together
with
white
bear
as
the
rock
river
flowed
into
the
great
river
his
arms
tightened
around
her
then
he
raised
his
hand
to
brush
the
fringe
of
hair
that
fell
over
her
forehead
she
moved
against
him
until
her
cheek
touched
his
slowly
she
slid
one
side
of
her
face
against
his
then
the
other
side
a
hunger
filled
her
it
was
almost
as
if
she
wanted
to
devour
white
bear
but
all
she
could
do
was
touch
his
smooth
cheek
with
her
fingertips
his
nostrils
flared
and
his
lips
parted
and
she
could
hear
his
breathing
his
hands
were
roaming
over
her
body
awakening
powerful
feelings
wherever
he
touched
her
making
her
want
more
how
did
they
come
to
be
lying
down
they
must
have
moved
without
realizing
it
she
could
see
feel
and
think
only
of
white
bear
her
head
was
pillowed
on
his
arm
and
her
face
was
pressed
against
his
with
his
free
hand
he
caressed
her
seeking
her
flesh
under
her
jacket
and
skirt
his
hand
became
bolder
plucking
at
the
laces
that
held
her
clothing
together
baring
places
that
only
a
husband
should
look
at
as
he
was
looking
now
and
touching
those
places
sending
ripples
of
delight
all
through
her
and
she
wanted
him
to
do
that
she
felt
no
shame
or
fear
only
happiness
she
let
him
do
whatever
he
wanted
she
helped
him
she
moved
her
hands
also
to
touch
more
of
him
her
hand
found
the
oak
branch
that
he
had
been
holding
just
before
she
sat
down
with
him
she
put
the
branch
aside
and
let
her
fingers
feel
the
hardness
pushing
against
his
loincloth
he
was
ready
to
come
into
her
in
the
way
that
sun
woman
had
explained
she
could
still
stop
him
if
she
wanted
to
she
knew
him
and
trusted
that
he
would
not
do
anything
she
did
not
want
but
she
wanted
this
she
wanted
his
hand
to
go
on
skillfully
preparing
the
way
for
him
she
wanted
this
golden
glow
inside
her
to
fill
her
more
and
more
this
was
happiness
and
she
was
climbing
toward
a
greater
and
greater
happiness
she
felt
him
move
and
all
at
once
her
hand
was
not
on
his
loincloth
but
on
his
hot
flesh
she
wanted
to
open
herself
up
to
the
part
of
him
she
held
so
tightly
then
he
was
upon
her
and
she
felt
a
sudden
stabbing
pain
she
cried
out
almost
at
once
his
cry
of
pleasure
followed
on
hers
and
his
hips
thrust
forward
violently
and
she
felt
him
filling
her
he
let
out
a
long
sigh
and
relaxed
lying
on
top
of
her
resting
all
of
his
weight
on
her
i
am
like
the
turtle
holding
up
the
earth
she
thought
there
had
been
mounting
pleasure
until
her
moment
of
pain
now
there
was
an
ache
and
a
faint
memory
of
the
good
feelings
she
wanted
more
pleasure
sun
woman
had
told
her
it
would
hurt
only
the
first
time
and
that
from
then
on
it
would
be
better
and
better
slowly
he
withdrew
from
her
and
they
lay
on
their
sides
looking
at
each
other
his
eyes
were
huge
right
before
her
face
for
a
moment
he
said
softly
i
felt
as
i
did
when
i
walked
on
the
bridge
of
stars
she
thought
of
asking
him
whether
it
made
him
so
happy
that
he
would
stay
with
her
now
instead
of
going
to
the
country
of
the
pale
eyes
with
his
father
but
she
knew
what
his
answer
would
be
and
that
his
saying
it
would
only
hurt
him
and
her
she
said
it
was
sun
woman
your
mother
who
told
me
about
this
about
what
men
and
women
do
together
he
laughed
it
was
also
she
who
told
me
his
face
reddened
i
feel
as
if
my
mother
were
here
watching
us
it
was
redbird
turn
to
laugh
what
would
she
see
that
she
did
not
know
about
already
he
shook
his
head
i
would
not
want
anybody
to
see
us
doing
that
the
spirits
watch
us
that
is
not
the
same
they
watch
everything
so
it
is
not
special
to
them
is
it
special
to
you
she
asked
oh
yes
something
has
passed
between
us
i
have
given
a
part
of
myself
to
you
and
i
have
a
part
of
you
too
now
even
if
i
must
leave
you
we
will
still
be
with
each
other
she
did
not
want
to
hear
him
speak
of
leaving
she
wanted
to
stay
here
with
him
in
this
grove
of
ancient
trees
forever
when
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
going
off
and
being
alone
together
this
was
what
she
imagined
it
would
be
like
but
then
a
dark
thought
crossed
her
mind
white
bear
they
might
send
people
looking
for
us
they
might
catch
us
together
like
this
anxiously
she
started
to
pull
her
clothing
together
he
sat
up
beside
her
and
put
his
hand
over
hers
i
do
not
think
anyone
is
coming
he
sounded
so
sure
that
she
thought
he
must
be
speaking
as
a
shaman
they
know
i
will
come
back
to
the
village
he
added
they
saw
me
smoke
the
calumet
and
in
a
few
days
i
will
leave
with
star
arrow
he
said
it
with
such
finality
that
the
sun
seemed
to
go
out
and
so
there
is
time
he
said
if
you
want
and
guided
her
hand
to
touch
him
to
her
joy
she
felt
him
strong
in
his
readiness
to
be
within
her
again
this
time
she
was
sure
it
would
not
hurt
she
would
know
the
full
delight
that
sun
woman
had
told
her
of
the
afternoon
sunlight
slanting
through
the
budding
branches
was
warm
again
bathing
her
and
making
her
feel
joyful
and
free
their
flowing
together
lasted
longer
this
time
and
gave
her
all
the
happiness
she
had
hoped
for
and
it
came
to
her
as
they
lay
peacefully
side
by
side
afterward
that
this
might
have
happened
someday
but
it
would
not
have
happened
today
if
star
arrow
had
not
come
to
claim
his
son
raoul
mark
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
of
their
journey
north
from
saukenuk
along
the
great
river
when
the
sun
was
halfway
up
the
sky
white
bear
and
star
arrow
emerged
from
a
forest
into
a
prairie
to
their
right
were
gentle
hills
covered
with
new
green
buffalo
grass
and
prairie
flowers
of
every
color
to
their
left
the
hills
stood
taller
then
dropped
suddenly
to
the
great
river
white
bear
saw
a
large
boat
with
great
white
wings
above
it
to
carry
it
along
star
arrow
brought
his
tall
black
stallion
to
a
sudden
halt
and
climbed
down
gesturing
to
white
bear
to
dismount
from
his
brown
and
white
pony
look
at
this
stone
star
arrow
said
pointing
to
a
large
gray
rock
that
stood
upright
on
the
edge
of
a
bluff
overlooking
the
river
white
bear
saw
carving
on
the
rock
and
remembering
père
lessons
recognized
it
as
the
pale
eyes
letter
m
for
de
marion
said
star
arrow
we
are
now
on
land
belonging
to
the
de
marion
family
you
see
no
fences
here
because
we
could
not
cut
enough
wood
to
fence
off
all
our
land
there
is
so
much
of
it
he
reached
out
and
rested
his
hand
on
white
bear
shoulder
his
fingers
squeezing
through
the
buckskin
shirt
but
before
we
come
to
the
place
where
i
live
and
where
you
will
live
we
must
speak
of
names
among
the
pale
eyes
i
am
called
pierre
de
marion
my
full
name
is
pierre
louis
auguste
de
marion
he
made
white
bear
say
pierre
de
marion
after
him
according
to
our
custom
you
should
call
me
father
star
arrow
said
saying
the
word
in
english
white
bear
already
knew
it
now
i
will
tell
you
what
your
name
will
be
among
the
pale
eyes
white
bear
pulled
free
of
star
arrow
hand
and
took
a
step
backward
i
already
have
a
name
i
was
born
gray
cloud
because
i
am
neither
white
nor
red
he
could
hear
reproach
in
his
voice
though
he
had
not
meant
to
sound
that
way
but
now
i
am
white
bear
that
is
the
name
given
me
by
the
shaman
owl
carver
after
my
spirit
journey
i
must
keep
that
name
and
you
will
keep
that
name
son
you
will
always
be
white
bear
but
just
as
i
am
happy
to
have
the
british
band
call
me
star
arrow
so
you
can
have
a
pale
eyes
name
one
that
tells
pale
eyes
when
you
go
among
them
who
you
are
that
you
are
a
member
of
the
de
marion
family
that
you
are
my
son
is
proud
that
i
am
his
white
bear
anger
faded
and
he
felt
a
warmth
toward
this
man
who
wanted
to
give
him
a
name
he
decided
that
if
star
arrow
could
have
two
names
so
could
he
what
is
my
pale
eyes
name
to
be
father
star
arrow
put
his
hand
on
white
bear
shoulder
i
wish
you
to
be
called
auguste
de
marion
auguste
is
a
very
old
name
it
means
a
sacred
person
and
that
is
a
good
name
for
one
who
has
seen
a
vision
and
wishes
to
be
a
shaman
say
it
after
me
auguste
as
they
rode
on
through
the
de
marion
lands
people
called
out
from
cabins
mounted
men
who
saluted
pierre
with
a
wave
of
their
hands
rode
among
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
of
horses
auguste
thought
realizing
he
was
seeing
wealth
that
would
amaze
any
man
of
the
british
band
farther
along
they
passed
fields
fenced
off
with
logs
split
in
two
and
piled
one
on
top
of
the
other
sheep
roamed
over
low
hills
and
cropped
the
prairie
grass
to
its
very
roots
inside
a
smaller
plot
huge
gray
and
pink
pigs
rolled
in
mud
beside
a
pond
they
passed
fields
planted
with
crops
the
whole
village
of
saukenuk
with
all
the
farmland
around
it
would
fit
into
one
of
those
fields
he
recognized
one
crop
corn
corn
as
far
as
he
could
see
how
much
corn
could
the
de
marions
eat
they
must
be
a
huge
tribe
as
they
rode
along
pierre
said
one
more
thing
for
you
to
know
auguste
you
will
meet
the
rest
of
your
family
today
your
grandfather
and
your
aunt
my
sister
he
stopped
his
horse
auguste
reined
up
his
pony
and
waited
unhappiness
dragged
down
the
lines
in
pierre
face
i
must
tell
you
that
i
also
have
a
brother
your
uncle
who
he
hesitated
who
may
not
be
friendly
to
you
why
auguste
asked
thirteen
summers
ago
another
sister
of
mine
and
he
were
captured
by
the
potawatomi
during
the
war
between
the
british
and
the
americans
my
sister
was
murdered
by
them
raoul
my
brother
suffered
greatly
until
we
found
him
and
ransomed
him
he
hates
not
just
the
potawatomi
but
all
red
men
he
did
not
wish
me
to
bring
you
back
here
to
our
home
i
do
not
understand
said
auguste
how
could
a
man
hate
all
tribes
because
of
what
the
men
of
one
tribe
had
done
to
him
again
he
realized
what
a
mystery
the
pale
eyes
were
and
he
felt
fear
pierre
said
he
probably
will
not
be
there
when
we
arrive
i
had
to
tell
you
about
raoul
but
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
afraid
of
him
but
he
afraid
he
told
himself
as
they
rode
on
his
belly
felt
hollow
and
his
heart
beat
faster
than
his
pony
trotting
hooves
he
was
afraid
of
the
pale
eyes
and
their
strange
ways
he
felt
more
fear
now
than
he
had
when
he
walked
on
the
bridge
of
stars
with
the
white
bear
there
pierre
suddenly
held
out
his
hand
auguste
eyes
followed
the
gesture
and
his
mouth
dropped
open
what
at
first
he
thought
he
saw
was
a
forest
of
trees
covered
with
snow
in
their
midst
something
rose
like
a
great
gray
hill
snow
in
the
moon
of
buds
perhaps
the
pale
eyes
did
have
a
magic
of
their
own
as
they
rode
closer
the
snow
on
the
trees
turned
into
flowers
he
had
seen
wild
apple
trees
in
bloom
and
knew
that
many
trees
flowered
around
this
time
but
these
trees
were
all
planted
in
straight
rows
and
each
one
was
a
mass
of
white
blossoms
what
he
had
thought
was
a
gray
hill
was
the
biggest
lodge
he
had
ever
seen
he
jerked
the
reins
of
his
horse
to
stop
so
that
he
could
sit
and
wonder
at
what
he
was
seeing
he
felt
pierre
stop
beside
him
the
great
lodge
seemed
to
be
made
of
three
or
four
lodges
all
joined
together
with
one
central
building
higher
than
all
the
rest
its
high
peaked
roof
was
of
logs
split
in
half
with
the
flat
sides
turned
outward
the
lower
part
of
the
lodge
was
made
of
stones
the
upper
part
of
logs
dread
filled
him
seeing
that
these
people
could
do
so
much
they
could
hold
so
much
land
that
a
rider
needed
half
a
day
to
cross
from
edge
to
center
they
could
make
the
land
obey
their
wishes
fence
it
fill
it
with
animals
plant
huge
fields
with
crops
enjoy
a
forest
of
flowering
trees
and
in
the
very
center
of
all
this
they
could
make
a
lodge
gigantic
enough
to
hold
a
hundred
families
the
pale
eyes
could
do
anything
they
were
magicians
so
mighty
as
to
make
a
shaman
like
owl
carver
look
childish
how
could
he
ever
hope
to
know
all
that
they
knew
despair
crushed
him
he
wanted
to
see
no
more
pierre
patted
auguste
pony
on
the
neck
and
the
little
horse
started
forward
again
numbly
auguste
felt
himself
being
led
toward
the
great
lodge
his
pony
hooves
falling
softly
on
white
petals
pierre
pointed
proudly
we
call
our
house
victoire
closer
and
closer
they
came
until
the
house
blocked
out
part
of
the
sky
it
was
gray
the
logs
it
was
built
of
having
weathered
auguste
saw
that
there
were
many
smaller
buildings
scattered
around
the
giant
lodge
smaller
only
compared
to
the
huge
one
in
the
center
some
of
the
smaller
houses
were
connected
to
the
great
one
by
sheltered
walkways
the
smallest
was
much
bigger
than
the
biggest
lodge
in
saukenuk
in
a
moment
they
would
emerge
from
among
the
flowering
trees
auguste
saw
a
log
fence
ahead
the
fence
surrounded
a
low
hill
covered
with
grass
leading
up
to
the
house
one
large
old
maple
tree
shaded
the
south
side
he
checked
his
pony
he
could
go
no
farther
what
is
it
pierre
asked
him
i
can
not
auguste
said
i
can
not
go
there
he
felt
a
quaver
in
his
voice
and
his
lips
trembling
and
he
held
himself
rigid
why
not
auguste
pierre
said
softly
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
here
i
have
never
seen
such
a
place
as
this
i
will
do
foolish
things
all
those
people
will
laugh
at
me
you
will
not
want
me
for
a
son
let
us
wait
said
pierre
get
down
from
your
horse
biting
his
lip
auguste
dismounted
we
shall
sit
here
said
pierre
they
sat
facing
each
other
auguste
saw
people
approaching
through
the
straight
rows
of
trees
pierre
saw
them
too
and
waved
them
away
they
sat
for
a
long
time
in
silence
while
their
horses
grazed
nearby
auguste
held
his
misery
in
until
he
felt
calmer
he
looked
at
pierre
and
nodded
to
say
that
he
was
in
control
of
himself
pierre
nodded
back
auguste
looked
at
the
ground
feeling
crushed
all
this
is
strange
to
you
pierre
said
yes
said
auguste
and
it
is
not
foolish
to
fear
there
are
some
people
here
who
will
hate
you
just
because
you
are
a
red
man
there
are
people
who
will
be
afraid
of
you
but
there
are
dangers
in
the
life
you
come
from
fire
and
flood
sickness
bears
and
wolves
the
sioux
and
osage
enemies
of
your
people
you
fear
those
things
but
you
have
been
taught
how
to
live
with
those
dangers
there
are
other
people
here
people
like
myself
who
will
care
for
you
and
protect
you
and
teach
you
how
to
live
with
the
dangers
of
the
pale
eyes
world
you
must
come
to
know
these
people
who
will
help
you
i
want
you
to
be
glad
you
came
from
saukenuk
to
victoire
auguste
did
not
answer
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
while
then
pierre
spoke
again
the
pale
eyes
are
here
auguste
and
you
must
learn
to
live
with
us
auguste
sighed
and
settled
down
again
he
listened
to
the
buzzing
of
locusts
rise
and
fall
my
vision
of
this
man
meant
something
then
come
to
me
now
white
bear
and
tell
me
what
i
must
he
carried
a
handful
of
bits
of
magic
mushroom
in
a
saddlebag
but
several
times
since
his
spirit
journey
the
white
bear
had
spoken
to
him
without
the
help
of
the
mushroom
and
without
his
mind
leaving
his
body
all
he
needed
to
do
sometimes
was
sit
quietly
and
listen
he
waited
now
sometimes
looking
at
pierre
sometimes
looking
at
the
twigs
and
moss
and
grass
on
the
ground
no
spirit
can
reach
me
here
in
the
land
of
the
pale
he
was
about
to
give
up
and
get
to
his
feet
he
would
beg
pierre
to
let
him
go
back
to
the
sauk
then
a
voice
spoke
deep
and
clear
in
his
mind
and
it
was
not
his
voice
and
meet
your
a
warmth
spread
from
the
center
of
his
body
to
hands
and
feet
that
a
moment
ago
had
been
icy
with
fear
knowing
that
he
had
not
left
his
spirit
helper
behind
when
he
left
saukenuk
gave
him
new
confidence
he
held
out
his
hands
palms
up
let
us
go
to
meet
my
grandfather
the
smile
on
pierre
long
face
mirrored
the
glow
auguste
felt
inside
himself
they
remounted
and
rode
around
to
a
gateway
in
the
west
side
of
the
fence
surrounding
the
house
auguste
with
his
newfound
strength
endured
the
curious
stares
of
the
men
and
women
gathered
at
the
gate
to
greet
pierre
look
your
grandfather
is
waiting
for
you
said
pierre
his
voice
ringing
with
joy
before
a
doorway
sheltered
by
its
own
wooden
roof
an
old
man
a
very
stout
young
woman
and
a
plump
young
man
awaited
them
the
old
man
eyes
were
blue
like
pierre
but
they
seemed
to
glitter
and
to
see
deeply
into
auguste
he
was
tall
and
thin
and
slightly
stooped
with
age
his
clothes
were
simple
a
black
jacket
over
a
white
shirt
and
black
trousers
that
tightened
below
his
knees
and
ended
in
straps
that
ran
under
shiny
black
shoes
he
leaned
on
a
black
stick
with
a
silver
head
his
heart
fluttering
with
excitement
auguste
got
down
from
his
horse
and
took
a
tentative
step
forward
the
old
man
approached
him
his
expression
as
fierce
as
a
hawk
he
looked
hard
into
auguste
face
the
old
man
spoke
to
him
in
a
language
of
the
pale
eyes
so
rapidly
that
auguste
could
not
hope
to
understand
him
pierre
said
your
grandfather
says
he
sees
at
once
that
you
are
a
member
of
our
family
he
sees
it
in
the
shape
of
your
eyes
he
sees
it
in
your
nose
in
your
chin
he
sees
that
like
all
de
marion
men
you
are
very
tall
what
is
my
grandfather
name
auguste
asked
he
is
the
chevalier
elysée
de
marion
auguste
said
and
his
grandfather
clapped
his
hands
and
grinned
but
you
should
call
him
grandpapa
pierre
concluded
grandpapa
that
was
another
word
père
isaac
had
taught
him
grandpapa
gave
a
cackling
old
man
laugh
threw
his
arms
wide
and
hugged
auguste
auguste
hugged
him
back
rather
gingerly
fearing
his
bones
might
crack
a
thought
came
to
auguste
and
he
let
go
of
his
grandfather
he
hurried
back
to
his
horse
and
took
out
of
the
saddlebag
the
tobacco
pouch
he
had
packed
along
with
his
small
medicine
bundle
he
went
back
to
elysée
and
held
the
pouch
out
with
both
hands
in
his
best
english
he
said
please
i
give
grandpapa
tobacco
elysée
took
the
pouch
and
opened
it
sniffed
and
grinned
appreciatively
he
and
pierre
exchanged
words
pierre
said
i
have
told
him
that
among
the
sauk
tobacco
is
offered
to
honored
friends
to
men
of
high
rank
and
to
great
spirits
this
pleases
him
thank
you
auguste
grandpapa
said
i
will
smoke
it
in
my
pipe
after
we
eat
together
this
time
he
spoke
slowly
enough
for
auguste
to
understand
him
grandpapa
now
took
the
stout
woman
by
the
arm
and
pulled
her
forward
this
is
your
aunt
my
sister
nicole
hopkins
said
pierre
never
among
the
sauk
had
he
seen
a
woman
with
such
broad
hips
and
such
a
vast
bosom
she
stepped
forward
and
placed
her
lips
to
surprise
on
his
cheek
making
a
little
smacking
sound
not
sure
what
to
do
auguste
put
his
arms
around
the
woman
as
he
had
around
his
grandfather
she
felt
soft
and
comfortable
and
not
at
all
fragile
and
he
hugged
her
hard
he
felt
powerful
muscles
under
her
ample
flesh
his
aunt
returned
the
embrace
with
strong
arms
she
smelled
of
flowers
all
at
once
auguste
sensed
that
there
was
a
baby
growing
inside
the
woman
holding
him
not
because
she
was
so
big
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
way
she
looked
it
was
a
sensing
and
he
was
pleased
to
know
that
along
with
the
white
bear
he
had
not
left
his
powers
behind
at
saukenuk
pierre
said
now
meet
frank
hopkins
your
uncle
by
marriage
at
pierre
gesture
the
man
approached
auguste
auguste
opened
his
arms
to
hug
him
but
the
man
stuck
his
right
hand
out
the
man
fingers
were
black
that
was
odd
he
had
never
seen
painted
fingers
before
was
this
another
pale
eyes
custom
auguste
decided
he
was
expected
to
hold
out
his
own
right
hand
frank
seized
his
hand
in
a
strong
grip
and
shook
it
up
and
down
frank
makes
the
talking
papers
from
which
people
may
read
and
learn
things
said
pierre
he
also
builds
things
of
wood
he
built
some
of
the
newer
buildings
here
on
our
land
frank
and
nicole
and
their
children
live
over
by
the
river
in
a
town
called
victor
he
built
many
of
the
houses
there
too
the
people
had
been
so
friendly
that
auguste
had
gotten
over
much
of
his
fear
but
when
he
saw
pierre
wave
him
toward
the
door
which
yawned
above
him
like
an
enormous
cave
mouth
he
felt
cold
once
again
but
he
followed
pierre
through
the
door
and
his
breath
left
his
body
in
amazement
it
was
like
being
in
a
forest
clearing
where
the
trees
towered
over
you
and
their
branches
met
high
up
blocking
out
the
sky
in
a
sauk
lodge
he
could
reach
up
and
touch
the
roof
without
straightening
his
arm
here
the
ceiling
was
hidden
in
shadows
and
huge
timbers
crossed
the
open
space
above
his
head
hung
by
ropes
from
those
timbers
were
big
circles
of
wood
that
père
isaac
had
said
were
called
wheels
these
wheels
were
turned
on
their
sides
and
set
on
them
were
dozens
of
the
little
white
sticks
of
wax
that
pale
eyes
used
to
make
light
a
few
of
the
more
prosperous
sauk
families
sometimes
used
such
wax
sticks
to
light
their
lodges
auguste
looked
around
in
wonder
the
huge
room
was
full
of
objects
whose
purpose
he
could
not
guess
doorways
led
to
other
parts
of
this
house
or
to
attached
houses
cooking
smells
of
many
kinds
of
good
food
filled
the
air
pale
eyes
men
and
women
stood
about
in
the
hall
and
watched
auguste
and
his
father
and
grandfather
enter
two
small
boys
and
a
girl
running
through
the
hall
stopped
to
stare
at
him
frank
hopkins
called
to
them
and
they
approached
slowly
these
are
thomas
benjamin
and
abigail
nicole
and
frank
children
said
pierre
other
thought
auguste
wondering
whether
nicole
herself
knew
what
he
knew
about
her
abigail
stood
close
to
her
father
her
mouth
and
eyes
wide
open
thomas
the
biggest
of
the
three
said
gosh
almighty
i
got
a
real
injun
for
a
cousin
benjamin
walked
slowly
over
to
auguste
suddenly
reached
out
and
gripped
the
deerhorn
handle
of
the
knife
at
his
belt
auguste
tensed
but
benjamin
grinned
up
at
auguste
and
let
go
of
the
knife
without
trying
to
pull
it
out
of
its
scabbard
then
he
ran
back
to
his
father
grandpapa
elysée
beckoned
and
as
auguste
walked
toward
him
he
noticed
that
the
soles
of
his
moccasins
were
striking
a
hard
surface
he
looked
down
to
see
that
the
floor
of
the
lodge
was
covered
with
flat
stones
auguste
and
the
others
followed
grandpapa
across
the
length
of
the
floor
to
a
stone
hearth
so
big
a
man
could
stand
inside
it
they
passed
three
long
platforms
raised
as
high
above
the
floor
as
the
sleeping
platforms
in
sauk
and
fox
summer
lodges
those
are
tables
pierre
said
auguste
remembered
the
word
from
a
book
of
words
and
pictures
père
isaac
had
shown
him
on
the
tables
lay
a
confusion
of
shiny
objects
a
man
standing
by
the
hearth
who
appeared
as
old
as
elysée
stepped
forward
and
bowed
he
had
a
round
bright
red
nose
and
white
whiskers
that
stood
out
on
either
side
of
his
face
this
is
guichard
our
majordomo
said
pierre
domo
repeated
auguste
guichard
came
over
from
france
with
us
thirty
years
ago
guichard
said
i
greet
you
auguste
auguste
was
amazed
to
hear
him
speak
in
the
sauk
language
he
spoke
with
a
lisp
though
and
auguste
noticed
when
he
opened
his
mouth
that
he
had
no
front
teeth
pierre
clapped
guichard
on
the
shoulder
i
do
not
know
how
he
does
these
things
but
he
always
surprises
us
with
what
he
has
learned
and
by
his
care
for
us
in
so
many
ways
guichard
stepped
back
with
another
bow
and
pierre
turned
to
a
short
man
and
a
plump
woman
also
standing
before
the
hearth
the
woman
full
lips
curved
in
a
smile
of
greeting
for
pierre
then
she
plucked
at
her
skirts
lifting
them
a
bit
and
bent
her
knees
and
ducked
her
head
this
is
marchette
perrault
pierre
said
and
auguste
noticed
that
his
normally
pale
face
was
flushed
she
reigns
over
our
kitchen
auguste
did
not
need
to
rely
on
his
special
sense
to
see
that
there
was
a
loving
secret
between
marchette
and
his
father
the
man
standing
beside
marchette
short
and
with
a
bristling
brown
beard
was
staring
at
pierre
with
hatred
in
his
face
his
eyes
narrowed
his
mouth
was
invisible
in
his
beard
but
auguste
knew
that
his
lips
were
pressed
together
his
teeth
clenched
he
also
knew
that
this
short
man
was
as
strong
as
a
bull
buffalo
the
look
the
man
gave
pierre
frightened
auguste
and
he
wondered
if
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
see
it
armand
perrault
here
is
the
overseer
of
our
estate
pierre
said
apparently
oblivious
of
the
man
expression
he
makes
the
crops
flourish
the
trees
bear
fruit
and
the
cattle
grow
fat
he
and
marchette
come
from
french
families
who
settled
here
many
generations
ago
armand
bowed
a
quick
jerk
of
his
head
and
shoulders
to
pierre
somewhat
to
auguste
relief
the
angry
man
did
not
even
look
at
him
abruptly
he
turned
his
back
and
strode
across
the
hall
to
a
side
door
pierre
said
most
of
those
who
live
and
work
here
at
victoire
are
illinois
people
of
french
descent
the
town
victor
grew
up
after
we
built
our
home
here
most
of
the
people
there
are
americans
from
missouri
kentucky
or
back
east
everyone
you
meet
in
america
is
from
somewhere
else
my
auguste
thought
marchette
made
another
bow
to
pierre
and
left
too
to
go
into
another
connected
house
in
which
auguste
saw
a
fire
burning
under
a
huge
metal
pot
in
another
hearth
there
was
much
smoke
and
steam
in
that
lodge
and
he
could
not
see
everything
but
the
good
smells
were
coming
from
there
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
today
but
a
little
dried
venison
pierre
took
auguste
by
the
arm
and
led
him
to
a
place
at
the
table
near
grandpapa
guichard
pushed
a
wooden
seat
made
of
sticks
toward
him
a
chair
auguste
remembered
from
père
isaac
picture
book
do
they
sit
up
high
and
raise
their
food
up
so
high
auguste
wondered
perhaps
pale
eyes
did
not
keep
their
floors
clean
enough
to
sit
on
and
eat
from
but
these
appeared
very
clean
this
is
a
special
meal
in
your
honor
said
pierre
most
of
the
people
who
work
on
our
land
will
be
eating
here
with
us
men
and
women
were
seating
themselves
at
the
other
tables
feast
thought
auguste
perhaps
there
would
be
dancing
afterward
how
many
people
live
on
your
land
father
he
asked
in
sauk
about
a
hundred
men
women
and
children
live
and
work
here
pierre
answered
beyond
the
hills
to
the
west
by
the
river
is
the
settlement
called
victor
where
another
hundred
people
live
many
of
them
work
for
us
too
nicole
and
frank
live
in
victor
two
hundred
thought
auguste
that
was
not
so
many
after
all
there
were
nearly
two
thousand
people
in
the
british
band
nicole
sat
beside
him
pierre
across
the
table
from
him
nicole
went
through
the
names
of
the
objects
on
the
table
plate
glass
knife
fork
spoon
guichard
was
going
around
the
table
behind
the
people
sitting
there
filling
each
glass
with
a
red
liquid
from
a
pitcher
auguste
had
seen
beads
and
other
small
objects
made
of
glass
at
saukenuk
but
here
glass
was
everywhere
what
was
glass
and
how
did
the
pale
eyes
make
things
from
it
even
as
he
was
wondering
about
glass
he
saw
his
father
take
out
of
his
coat
pocket
an
oval
silver
case
hanging
from
a
purple
cord
around
his
neck
pierre
opened
the
case
and
took
out
yet
two
more
small
round
pieces
of
glass
in
a
metal
frame
to
auguste
bewilderment
he
put
these
over
his
eyes
like
a
transparent
mask
he
smiled
when
he
saw
auguste
staring
spectacles
i
have
trouble
seeing
things
that
are
near
to
me
and
these
help
i
like
to
see
what
i
eating
last
night
as
auguste
lay
beside
the
sleeping
star
arrow
in
the
tall
prairie
grass
he
had
thought
of
quietly
climbing
on
his
pony
and
fleeing
back
to
saukenuk
in
spite
of
the
promise
now
he
was
glad
he
had
not
run
away
the
people
all
looked
kindly
at
him
except
for
that
man
armand
and
there
were
so
many
wonders
to
see
he
could
feel
his
heart
beating
hard
and
his
hands
trembling
with
excitement
when
guichard
filled
his
glass
with
the
red
liquid
auguste
drank
from
it
the
liquid
was
cool
and
burned
at
the
same
time
it
was
bitter
and
puckered
his
lips
but
was
sweet
in
his
throat
he
was
thirsty
so
he
drank
more
of
it
wine
said
pierre
you
had
it
before
must
be
like
that
burning
water
the
pale
eyes
call
whiskey
that
i
tasted
at
the
council
last
moon
of
falling
leaves
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
the
chiefs
and
braves
and
warriors
had
drunk
much
of
the
burning
water
from
a
barrel
he
remembered
and
they
had
grown
merrier
and
merrier
the
women
and
boys
were
each
allowed
one
small
sip
and
the
young
girls
none
at
all
i
have
tasted
it
he
said
pierre
frowned
and
seemed
about
to
speak
but
he
said
nothing
when
auguste
held
his
empty
glass
out
for
more
wine
to
guichard
who
was
going
around
again
with
the
pitcher
men
and
women
brought
food
to
the
table
on
big
plates
and
in
bowls
there
was
turkey
duck
fresh
venison
flat
bread
and
round
bread
dark
bread
white
bread
and
yellow
corn
bread
cooked
fruit
and
raw
fruit
loaves
of
maple
sugar
fruit
baked
inside
crusts
heaps
of
vegetables
there
were
slices
of
fish
burned
almost
black
and
piles
of
boiled
crawfish
the
food
auguste
saw
was
coming
from
the
connected
lodge
marchette
had
gone
into
where
the
big
pot
was
with
all
the
smoke
and
steam
auguste
watched
the
way
the
people
at
the
table
with
him
were
eating
he
tried
to
use
his
knife
and
fork
as
they
did
and
saw
pierre
smile
approvingly
the
sight
and
smell
of
the
food
made
water
fill
his
mouth
and
his
stomach
growl
but
when
he
put
a
slice
of
meat
in
his
mouth
it
was
unexpectedly
very
hot
to
the
taste
not
just
hot
from
being
cooked
but
hot
because
of
something
cooked
into
it
he
thought
his
mother
kept
some
traded
up
from
the
south
in
her
collection
of
medicine
plants
and
he
had
tasted
their
fire
pierre
himself
auguste
noticed
put
very
small
portions
of
food
on
his
plate
and
ate
little
of
what
was
there
auguste
was
saddened
if
only
there
was
something
he
could
do
for
his
father
he
had
consulted
owl
carver
before
leaving
saukenuk
but
the
old
shaman
had
only
said
gloomily
that
in
his
experience
such
an
evil
spirit
in
the
belly
was
usually
fatal
the
hot
food
made
auguste
thirsty
and
he
drank
more
wine
each
time
he
held
his
glass
out
guichard
smiling
toothlessly
seemed
to
be
there
with
the
pitcher
still
hungry
he
grew
impatient
with
knife
and
fork
and
began
picking
the
food
up
with
his
hands
he
tried
to
take
small
pieces
with
his
fingers
and
eat
quickly
so
that
people
would
not
notice
but
then
he
caught
the
two
boys
and
the
girl
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
watching
him
and
giggling
and
whispering
to
each
other
his
face
went
hot
nicole
sitting
on
his
right
asked
him
short
simple
questions
about
how
the
sauk
and
fox
lived
and
he
answered
with
the
little
english
he
had
she
smiled
and
nodded
at
him
many
times
as
he
told
her
the
sauk
names
for
things
and
she
repeated
them
after
him
she
seemed
to
find
pronouncing
them
easy
the
other
people
mostly
talked
among
themselves
in
their
own
language
the
pale
eyes
never
stopped
talking
it
seemed
would
there
never
be
a
moment
of
thoughtful
silence
the
voices
all
speaking
so
fast
gabbling
like
a
flock
of
turkeys
made
him
dizzy
a
strange
feeling
was
coming
over
him
he
heard
a
buzzing
in
his
ears
like
locusts
on
the
prairie
his
face
felt
numb
he
reached
up
and
touched
his
cheeks
with
his
fingertips
and
it
was
as
if
he
felt
his
face
through
a
thin
invisible
cloth
his
stomach
started
to
churn
he
felt
with
a
sudden
panic
that
he
could
not
hold
all
the
food
he
had
eaten
the
peppers
and
the
wine
were
burning
together
in
his
stomach
he
lurched
to
his
feet
swaying
from
side
to
side
the
vast
room
seemed
to
be
spinning
like
a
canoe
in
a
whirlpool
and
the
voices
around
him
faded
away
he
felt
nicole
quickly
stand
up
with
him
her
hand
firmly
on
his
arm
steadying
him
he
shut
his
eyes
and
held
his
hand
tightly
over
his
mouth
wanting
to
die
of
shame
and
embarrassment
his
belly
bucked
like
a
wild
pony
hot
liquid
spurted
through
his
fingers
here
son
here
a
voice
said
he
opened
his
eyes
to
look
into
the
face
of
his
father
full
of
pain
for
him
pierre
held
a
large
wooden
bucket
under
his
chin
on
the
other
side
of
him
nicole
had
a
strong
grip
on
his
shoulder
auguste
took
his
hand
away
from
his
mouth
and
let
his
belly
give
up
what
it
had
held
stained
red
by
the
wine
the
food
he
had
just
eaten
poured
into
the
bucket
the
smell
of
vomit
filled
his
nostrils
making
him
feel
even
sicker
he
fell
to
his
knees
coughing
choking
tears
streaming
from
his
eyes
pierre
knelt
beside
him
still
holding
the
bucket
for
him
stomach
heaved
again
and
again
forcing
the
remnants
of
his
meal
through
his
throat
and
past
his
slack
lips
as
he
recovered
a
bit
he
heard
someone
laugh
softly
in
a
distant
part
of
the
room
and
someone
else
speak
in
the
pale
eyes
language
the
tone
of
contempt
was
unmistakable
he
was
overwhelmed
with
shame
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
before
his
entire
de
marion
family
and
their
whole
tribe
he
had
disgraced
the
sauk
he
had
embarrassed
his
father
it
was
as
he
had
feared
he
could
not
stay
here
it
was
too
painful
he
promised
himself
holding
his
aching
belly
i
leave
the
land
of
the
pale
eyes
reproaching
himself
pierre
knelt
beside
auguste
trying
through
the
pressure
of
his
hand
on
the
boy
back
to
tell
auguste
that
he
loved
him
said
he
had
tasted
wine
but
i
should
have
known
he
could
not
drink
so
much
the
poor
boy
must
be
dying
of
shame
and
it
is
all
the
fault
of
stupid
auguste
coughed
and
wiped
the
back
of
his
hand
over
his
face
pierre
patted
him
gently
on
the
back
nicole
kneeling
on
auguste
other
side
suddenly
turned
her
head
toward
the
door
and
drew
in
a
frightened
breath
pierre
looked
up
to
see
what
it
was
a
figure
filled
the
doorway
silhouetted
in
the
yellow
rectangle
of
afternoon
sunlight
pierre
at
once
recognized
the
truculent
set
of
raoul
broad
shoulders
the
forward
thrust
of
his
head
under
the
hat
pierre
had
time
for
one
more
anguished
thought
of
as
his
younger
brother
strode
toward
them
this
too
i
should
have
better
prepared
raoul
boots
sounded
on
the
flagstone
floor
pierre
tugged
on
auguste
arm
helping
him
to
his
feet
he
heard
nicole
whisk
away
the
bucket
so
this
is
the
little
mongrel
raoul
deep
voice
boomed
in
the
cavernous
log
hall
raoul
pierre
said
this
is
your
nephew
auguste
pierre
turned
to
auguste
and
in
sauk
said
this
is
your
uncle
raoul
he
lives
here
with
me
and
your
grandfather
he
speaks
with
a
rough
tongue
but
do
not
fear
him
how
could
the
boy
not
fear
a
man
like
raoul
auguste
is
it
a
fine
french
name
for
a
redskin
raoul
set
his
fists
on
his
hips
throwing
back
his
blue
jacket
to
show
his
pistol
and
a
huge
knife
in
its
scabbard
at
the
sight
of
the
weapons
pierre
heart
pounded
raoul
went
up
to
auguste
and
stared
into
his
face
as
pierre
stood
tensely
raoul
said
well
brother
you
actually
did
it
you
made
yourself
a
son
i
glad
you
admit
that
said
pierre
oh
i
admit
that
he
got
de
marion
written
all
over
his
dirty
face
but
do
call
him
my
i
reserve
that
title
for
legitimate
kin
pierre
hoped
auguste
knowledge
of
english
was
not
enough
to
let
him
understand
how
he
was
being
insulted
the
boy
looked
from
pierre
to
raoul
as
they
spoke
his
large
dark
eyes
watchful
his
face
expressionless
raoul
stop
this
it
was
nicole
back
from
getting
rid
of
the
bucket
i
auguste
aunt
and
you
his
uncle
and
you
might
as
well
get
used
to
it
and
you
are
spoiling
our
dinner
raoul
elysée
said
either
sit
and
eat
with
us
like
a
civilized
man
or
leave
us
alone
spoiling
your
dinner
raoul
gave
a
bellow
of
laughter
mean
to
tell
me
it
does
spoil
your
dinner
to
see
that
savage
puking
in
our
great
hall
mean
to
tell
me
civilized
pierre
glanced
across
the
table
at
his
father
and
frank
hopkins
who
had
both
risen
to
their
feet
elysée
eyes
burned
with
anger
frank
held
his
little
girl
hand
and
looked
sombrely
at
raoul
the
two
hopkins
boys
stared
at
their
uncle
pray
god
they
do
admire
him
boys
have
a
way
of
looking
up
to
men
who
behave
like
raoul
turned
to
nicole
his
teeth
flashing
white
under
his
thick
black
mustache
you
really
want
an
indian
nephew
have
you
forgot
what
indians
did
to
your
sister
no
i
never
forget
what
happened
to
helene
nicole
said
none
of
us
will
but
auguste
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
you
did
watch
your
sister
die
raoul
said
so
that
just
the
sight
of
an
indian
makes
you
want
to
kill
pierre
saw
that
raoul
was
working
himself
up
into
a
rage
he
would
talk
and
talk
and
every
word
he
said
would
make
him
angrier
until
at
last
the
explosion
a
spasm
of
pain
shot
across
pierre
stomach
he
prayed
let
the
illness
leave
me
alone
until
i
can
be
alone
with
nicole
cheeks
were
an
even
brighter
red
than
was
usual
for
her
but
she
spoke
gently
raoul
you
do
have
a
living
sister
if
it
had
been
me
at
fort
dearborn
instead
of
helene
if
i
had
been
raped
and
murdered
i
would
be
looking
down
from
heaven
and
i
would
be
hoping
your
wound
would
heal
i
would
pray
that
you
would
welcome
pierre
son
your
nephew
into
your
home
stop
saying
that
this
filthy
savage
is
my
nephew
said
raoul
look
at
him
standing
there
staring
at
me
you
know
what
the
word
mongrel
means
redskin
pierre
felt
a
surge
of
pride
as
he
saw
auguste
standing
straight
and
slender
gazing
levelly
at
raoul
savage
even
though
he
had
been
sick
only
a
moment
ago
auguste
held
himself
as
regally
as
a
young
prince
as
for
you
nicole
raoul
went
on
do
ever
think
you
can
speak
for
helene
she
may
be
in
heaven
now
but
she
got
there
by
way
of
hell
no
decent
woman
could
imagine
what
she
suffered
pierre
almost
screamed
aloud
as
the
pain
in
his
belly
stabbed
him
again
he
clutched
at
his
stomach
just
when
he
needed
all
his
strength
auguste
looked
into
his
eyes
then
down
at
his
hand
you
hurt
father
auguste
said
in
english
must
sit
down
oh
he
already
got
a
few
words
of
english
said
raoul
training
him
to
talk
eh
like
a
parrot
going
to
put
him
in
a
medicine
show
elysée
suddenly
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
my
friends
those
who
were
invited
to
dine
with
us
here
today
will
you
please
excuse
us
and
give
us
privacy
we
have
family
matters
to
discuss
silently
eyes
cast
down
the
thirty
or
so
servants
and
field
workers
who
had
been
invited
to
celebrate
the
coming
of
pierre
son
filed
out
of
the
hall
pierre
thought
so
many
things
i
have
failed
raoul
elysée
said
i
have
not
forgiven
helene
killers
but
i
am
not
stupid
enough
to
hate
all
indians
and
neither
should
you
be
do
you
think
whites
have
never
tortured
and
killed
indian
women
raoul
bared
his
teeth
again
if
you
ca
hate
the
indians
for
what
they
did
to
your
daughter
and
to
me
then
you
never
loved
either
one
of
us
pierre
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
anger
raoul
i
forbid
you
to
speak
that
way
to
our
father
you
are
cruel
and
unjust
you
owe
justice
pierre
you
and
papa
where
was
he
when
you
abandoned
me
to
the
indians
where
were
you
pierre
legs
shook
he
could
feel
the
rage
radiating
from
raoul
it
was
like
standing
too
close
to
a
stove
auguste
said
father
pierre
turned
and
looked
into
the
dark
young
eyes
auguste
spoke
in
sauk
father
i
am
the
cause
of
this
man
anger
there
is
much
to
explain
son
said
pierre
be
patient
and
quiet
and
all
will
be
well
pierre
saw
fear
struggling
with
resolution
in
his
son
face
a
pallor
in
the
fine
olive
skin
showed
that
auguste
had
not
yet
gotten
over
being
sick
auguste
squared
his
shoulders
and
took
a
step
toward
raoul
he
raised
his
right
hand
in
greeting
i
greet
uncle
he
said
solemnly
in
english
keep
this
mongrel
away
from
me
pierre
raoul
said
frank
said
nicole
take
the
children
out
of
here
frank
picked
abigail
up
and
carried
her
with
tom
and
benjamin
trailing
he
walked
off
toward
the
kitchen
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
at
nicole
elysée
said
remember
raoul
this
is
my
grandson
your
grandson
raoul
spat
auguste
held
out
his
right
hand
to
raoul
i
sorry
you
angry
want
be
friend
in
a
moment
pierre
thought
he
would
have
to
get
between
them
but
his
stomach
hurt
so
badly
that
he
could
hardly
move
if
you
want
to
be
my
friend
you
mongrel
bastard
get
as
far
away
from
this
house
and
from
me
as
you
can
raoul
said
auguste
took
another
step
toward
raoul
still
holding
out
his
hand
learned
about
shaking
hands
from
frank
hopkins
just
a
little
while
ago
pierre
remembered
auguste
no
pierre
cried
do
you
try
to
touch
me
redskin
raoul
thrust
out
his
own
hand
and
struck
at
auguste
he
grabbed
auguste
shirt
twisting
the
buckskin
in
his
big
hand
raoul
had
lost
all
control
the
fury
was
upon
him
pierre
forgot
about
his
own
pain
and
tried
to
throw
himself
between
raoul
and
auguste
his
chest
hit
raoul
arm
hard
as
an
iron
bar
let
go
of
him
raoul
pierre
said
raoul
stop
it
elysée
shouted
all
right
raoul
punched
his
fist
into
auguste
chest
and
released
him
sending
the
boy
staggering
backward
to
fall
to
the
floor
rage
blazed
up
inside
pierre
the
sight
of
his
son
knocked
to
the
floor
swept
away
all
constraint
to
the
devil
with
trying
to
reason
with
raoul
he
rushed
at
raoul
and
swung
his
arm
with
all
his
strength
bringing
his
palm
against
raoul
mouth
though
it
was
a
blow
that
would
have
knocked
many
a
man
down
raoul
only
staggered
back
half
a
step
but
a
trickle
of
blood
appeared
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
you
still
fight
like
a
frenchman
pierre
said
raoul
with
a
grin
wiping
his
mouth
slapping
a
man
think
you
still
a
count
or
something
fight
like
an
american
he
lunged
at
pierre
pierre
barely
saw
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
fist
coming
at
him
a
cannon
went
off
at
the
side
of
his
head
he
was
on
the
floor
flat
on
his
back
nicole
screamed
no
no
auguste
pierre
rolled
his
aching
head
to
one
side
to
see
auguste
standing
over
him
his
hand
on
the
deerhorn
hilt
of
the
knife
that
hung
at
his
belt
the
knife
pierre
had
left
for
him
when
he
was
a
baby
nicole
held
his
arm
with
both
hands
want
to
fight
with
knives
raoul
said
he
slid
his
own
huge
hunting
knife
out
and
held
it
upright
the
point
glittering
in
the
candlelight
come
on
redskin
raoul
shouted
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
charged
at
auguste
as
auguste
struggled
to
break
free
from
nicole
raoul
knife
flashed
and
pierre
heard
a
cry
of
pain
and
nicole
was
between
auguste
and
raoul
and
auguste
had
his
hand
to
his
face
and
blood
was
running
through
his
fingers
raoul
stepped
away
from
auguste
and
wiped
his
knife
on
a
white
tablecloth
what
have
you
done
pierre
shouted
i
was
kind
raoul
said
with
a
grin
pierre
rushed
to
auguste
blood
flowed
from
a
long
cut
that
ran
straight
down
auguste
cheek
from
just
below
his
eye
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
the
front
of
auguste
tan
buckskin
shirt
was
stained
red
if
he
pulled
that
knife
i

nicole
took
auguste
from
pierre
arms
she
pressed
a
white
napkin
to
his
bleeding
face
and
took
him
to
a
chair
to
sit
down
as
he
sat
auguste
turned
to
shoot
raoul
a
look
of
pure
hate

makes
it
soon
i
have
this
estate
pierre
felt
raoul
words
as
if
that
blade
had
plunged
into
his
heart
that
his
own
brother
should
wish
him
dead
pierre
went
to
stand
by
auguste
seated
in
a
chair
with
nicole
wiping
his
slashed
face
pierre
said
in
the
will
i
wrote
years
ago
i
named
you
as
my
heir
i
never
thought
to
change
that
will
until
today
raoul
still
wiping
his
knife
snorted
no
court
in
illinois
would
let
a
man
disinherit
a
legitimate
white
brother
in
favor
of
a
bastard
pierre
let
his
hand
rest
on
auguste
shoulder
the
boy
eyes
burned
up
at
him
pierre
looked
down
at
the
napkin
that
nicole
pressed
to
auguste
cheek
auguste
speaking
in
the
sauk
tongue
broke
the
silence
that
had
followed
raoul
words
even
if
he
is
your
brother
and
my
uncle
this
man
is
our
enemy
father
i
will
stand
side
by
side
with
you
against
him
auguste
put
his
hand
over
the
hand
that
lay
on
his
shoulder
raoul
slammed
his
knife
into
its
sheath
you
driven
me
out
of
my
home
pierre
i
not
living
under
the
same
roof
with
an
indian
i
be
back
till
i
can
come
back
as
master
of
this
house
he
strode
to
the
door
and
turned
again
and
then
i
bring
my
own
family
with
me
what
do
you
mean
your
own
family
elysée
called
across
the
long
hall
i
marrying
eli
greenglove
daughter
raoul
said
with
a
grin
and
that
mongrel
had
better
not
try
to
touch
my
children
he
was
gone
leaving
the
door
hanging
open
behind
him
sunlight
pouring
in
pierre
looked
miserably
down
at
auguste
and
thought
hope
your
shaman
skills
make
you
better
at
predicting
the
future
than
i
have
been
my
book
moon
of
ripe
cherries
homecoming
rejoicing
at
the
sight
of
victor
auguste
stepped
up
to
the
gangplank
of
the
paddle
wheeler
and
paused
there
a
moment
to
look
around
he
could
help
himself
he
smiled
broadly
the
settlement
hugging
the
bluff
was
not
home
but
it
was
closer
to
home
than
he
had
been
in
a
long
time
and
this
summer
he
had
decided
he
would
go
back
to
his
true
home
he
would
end
the
sorrow
of
being
cut
off
from
his
people
this
was
the
sixth
spring
since
pierre
de
marion
had
come
and
taken
him
to
victoire
and
as
with
every
spring
before
it
he
missed
saukenuk
terribly
he
longed
for
his
mother
for
the
teachings
of
owl
carver
for
the
arms
of
redbird
whom
he
had
lost
almost
as
soon
as
he
made
her
his
for
six
years
he
had
learned
to
count
years
as
white
people
did
he
had
obeyed
his
father
and
the
promise
made
with
the
calumet
and
had
not
tried
even
to
send
a
message
to
the
british
band
he
even
felt
it
was
a
wise
rule
to
communicate
with
his
loved
ones
would
have
torn
him
in
two
but
more
than
a
month
ago
in
new
york
city
strolling
in
the
warm
evening
air
on
the
busy
cobblestone
streets
past
dooryards
where
lilacs
were
blooming
he
made
up
his
mind
that
when
he
returned
to
illinois
he
would
visit
victoire
only
briefly
and
then
would
go
back
to
saukenuk
he
was
years
old
now
and
among
white
people
that
meant
he
was
master
of
his
own
life
he
gazed
up
at
the
bluff
there
were
more
houses
up
there
than
when
he
had
last
come
out
here
two
years
ago
some
were
built
on
the
bottomland
itself
in
spite
of
the
danger
of
flooding
he
saw
the
palisade
and
flags
and
towers
of
raoul
de
marion
trading
post
at
the
top
of
the
bluff
and
felt
his
joy
fading
he
would
have
to
face
raoul
insults
and
threats
as
he
had
every
other
time
he
came
back
to
victor
his
belly
tightened
as
he
remembered
as
if
it
had
just
happened
that
first
encounter
six
years
ago
the
feel
of
the
knifepoint
slicing
into
his
cheek
his
hand
gripping
his
own
knife
aunt
nicole
and
father
holding
him
back
seemingly
with
a
will
of
its
own
his
hand
went
to
the
scar
and
his
finger
traced
the
ridge
that
ran
from
eye
to
mouth
he
brought
his
gaze
down
from
the
top
of
the
bluff
and
saw
a
more
welcome
sight
grandpapa
aunt
nicole
and
guichard
in
a
black
open
carriage
from
the
estate
waiting
to
take
him
up
to
victoire
he
ran
down
the
gangplank
and
strode
over
to
them
auguste
my
god
you
beautiful
aunt
nicole
exclaimed
and
then
her
face
reddened
and
she
looked
downward
he
felt
that
he
looked
good
though
beautiful
as
he
understood
english
was
not
the
right
word
for
a
woman
to
use
about
a
man
but
he
supposed
she
admired
his
new
clothes
the
cutaway
coat
and
vest
the
ruffled
silk
shirt
the
tight
trousers
he
wished
he
were
not
already
holding
his
tall
beaver
hat
in
his
hand
so
that
he
could
tip
it
to
her
with
the
graceful
motion
he
learned
watching
the
dandies
on
broad
way
grandpapa
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
and
hugged
auguste
his
embrace
felt
strong
and
his
eyes
were
bright
auguste
was
happy
to
see
him
in
good
health
where
is
father
auguste
shook
hands
with
guichard
who
had
climbed
down
stiffly
from
the
driver
seat
your
trunk
monsieur
auguste
auguste
pointed
out
the
big
wooden
chest
with
brass
fittings
that
had
been
unloaded
at
the
victor
pier
along
with
bales
and
barrels
from
the
hold
of
the
guichard
approached
two
men
lounging
by
a
piling
he
pointed
out
the
trunk
as
auguste
had
done
for
said
one
of
the
men
glowering
at
auguste
from
under
his
coonskin
cap
white
men
do
wait
on
goddamn
injuns
he
spat
tobacco
juice
at
guichard
feet
and
turned
away
as
did
the
other
man
auguste
wanted
to
throw
the
man
who
had
spat
at
guichard
into
the
river
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
could
do
it
though
like
most
men
who
lived
in
victor
the
man
was
armed
with
knife
and
pistol
auguste
had
been
taught
to
fight
as
a
sauk
and
he
had
been
a
champion
boxer
wrestler
and
fencer
at
george
school
but
he
was
not
going
to
get
into
a
brawl
in
his
first
minutes
ashore
time
enough
for
that
if
he
met
raoul
come
on
guichard
the
trunk
light
enough
we
do
need
any
help
the
old
servant
taking
one
end
and
auguste
the
other
they
loaded
it
into
the
back
of
the
carriage
good
to
see
you
again
grandpapa
auguste
said
as
he
dropped
into
the
seat
facing
elysée
and
nicole
his
back
to
the
driver
aunt
nicole
it
you
who
are
beautiful
but
where
father
grandpapa
patted
him
on
the
knee
not
feeling
well
i
afraid
he
sends
his
apologies
we
will
go
to
him
now
at
once
grandpapa
was
trying
to
make
his
voice
sound
unconcerned
but
auguste
heard
an
undertone
of
sorrow
the
anguish
of
a
father
who
had
lost
one
of
his
children
years
ago
and
would
soon
lose
another
with
understanding
grief
sank
into
auguste
marrow
father
star
arrow
had
hung
on
these
past
six
years
growing
sicker
and
sicker
the
evil
in
his
belly
swelling
up
like
a
poisonous
toad
now
the
end
was
near
auguste
found
himself
looking
deep
into
aunt
nicole
eyes
full
of
shared
sorrow
guichard
flicked
the
reins
and
the
carriage
started
off
turning
away
from
the
dock
passing
the
warehouses
and
rattling
down
the
long
road
that
led
across
the
bottomland
fields
to
the
bluff
it
must
have
been
a
good
spring
out
here
though
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
july
the
corn
was
already
up
to
a
man
waist
auguste
felt
he
would
look
better
wearing
his
beaver
hat
as
they
rode
along
he
put
it
on
his
head
pulling
the
brim
down
with
both
hands
and
set
it
in
place
with
a
pat
on
the
crown
so
you
are
now
a
finished
graduate
of
george
school
said
elysée
with
a
smile
monsieur
charles
winans
has
sent
long
letters
full
of
good
reports
about
you
aunt
nicole
reached
over
and
squeezed
his
hand
we
proud
of
you
auguste
her
soft
fleshy
hand
was
warm
and
her
eyes
sparkled
at
him
he
sensed
a
feeling
in
her
that
was
more
than
the
affection
of
an
aunt
for
a
nephew
she
now
had
eight
children
he
knew
and
every
time
he
had
seen
her
and
frank
together
they
had
seemed
very
much
in
love
but
aunt
nicole
was
a
big
woman
she
had
room
in
her
big
heart
perhaps
for
more
than
one
love
embarrassed
by
what
he
felt
radiating
from
her
auguste
turned
to
elysée
if
i
learned
anything
at
george
i
owe
it
all
to
the
way
you
prepared
me
grandpapa
anyone
who
could
take
a
boy
who
could
barely
speak
english
and
in
two
years
cram
enough
knowledge
into
his
head
for
him
to
go
to
secondary
school
in
new
york
city
such
a
man
is
no
ordinary
teacher
you
were
no
ordinary
pupil
my
boy
said
elysée
leaning
back
in
the
carriage
his
hands
resting
one
on
top
of
the
other
on
his
cane
and
père
isaac
laid
down
a
solid
foundation
in
that
head
of
yours
those
jesuits
are
good
for
that
at
least
rogues
though
they
may
be
in
most
other
respects
papa
nicole
gave
elysée
a
reproving
frown
elysée
quickly
patted
her
knee
forgive
me
my
child
let
me
not
shake
the
faith
that
sustains
you
it
would
take
more
than
your
wicked
tongue
to
disturb
my
faith
papa
nicole
said
with
a
wry
smile
it
was
amusing
to
hear
grandpapa
and
aunt
nicole
bicker
about
what
the
whites
called
faith
as
the
carriage
rolled
along
auguste
recalled
the
many
lectures
he
had
listened
to
on
jesus
and
the
trinity
at
george
which
was
affiliated
with
the
episcopal
church
but
auguste
had
walked
with
the
white
bear
and
talked
with
the
turtle
he
them
as
he
had
never
known
the
white
people
god
and
what
went
on
in
their
dimly
lit
churches
had
no
attraction
for
him
he
knew
that
christians
for
the
most
part
saw
his
beliefs
about
the
spirit
world
as
rubbish
sprung
out
of
ignorance
or
worse
inspired
by
the
evil
one
père
isaac
efforts
to
persuade
him
to
walk
in
the
way
of
jesus
had
prepared
him
for
that
at
school
he
did
not
speak
of
things
sacred
to
him
so
as
not
to
expose
them
to
white
scorn
when
teachers
and
fellow
students
tried
to
persuade
him
to
take
instruction
in
christianity
he
was
polite
and
evasive
and
when
he
felt
he
was
smothering
in
the
noise
and
crowding
and
dirt
of
the
huge
city
of
new
york
he
would
borrow
a
pony
from
the
lady
he
called
aunt
emilie
his
father
cousin
actually
and
ride
out
of
new
york
along
a
trail
that
led
to
the
north
end
of
the
island
of
manhattan
there
in
a
forest
cave
he
had
found
he
would
chew
a
bit
of
the
sacred
mushroom
owl
carver
had
given
him
and
restore
his
link
with
the
spirit
world
by
journeying
with
the
white
bear
all
through
these
six
years
faith
had
remained
strong
nicole
broke
in
on
his
thoughts
you
still
studying
medicine
just
a
beginning
i
read
some
books
attended
some
lectures
i
assisted
a
surgeon
martin
bernard
at
new
york
hospital
i
bought
myself
a
surgeon
box
of
instruments
got
it
in
the
trunk
there
but
if
anybody
came
down
with
anything
worse
than
an
ingrown
toenail
i
be
scared
to
do
anything
about
it
elysée
said
you
can
pull
teeth
i
hope
like
any
proper
surgeon
auguste
shrugged
i
do
have
a
turnkey
for
that
but
i
never
actually
used
it
the
only
person
in
town
who
knows
anything
about
treating
the
sick
is
gram
medill
the
midwife
nicole
said
tom
slattery
the
blacksmith
pulls
teeth
we
need
a
real
doctor
auguste
felt
a
fluttering
in
his
stomach
as
he
wondered
when
he
should
tell
this
white
family
of
his
that
he
wanted
to
leave
them
nicole
was
thinking
he
realized
that
he
would
stay
here
at
victoire
the
wooden
wheels
of
the
carriage
bumped
mercilessly
over
the
rutted
road
and
auguste
hoped
nicole
was
pregnant
at
the
moment
the
fact
that
his
shaman
sense
did
not
tell
him
reminded
him
that
he
had
been
too
long
away
from
the
sauk
as
they
began
to
climb
the
road
that
ran
up
the
bluff
nicole
pointed
out
to
auguste
that
the
newer
houses
were
made
of
boards
rather
than
logs
because
frank
had
set
up
a
sawmill
and
workshop
on
the
peach
river
frank
was
now
a
master
carpenter
with
four
workers
to
help
him
when
there
was
a
house
to
be
built
but
he
sell
the
mill
in
a
minute
if
printing
alone
would
provide
him
with
a
living
she
said
that
where
his
heart
is
elysée
said
pierre
and
i
offered
frank
a
regular
income
so
that
he
could
give
all
his
time
to
his
newspaper
and
to
printing
but
he
would
hear
of
it
he
got
a
bit
haughty
when
i
pressed
him
and
informed
me
that
the
system
of
feudal
patronage
is
dead
i
assured
him
that
i
was
well
aware
of
that
and
that
is
why
i
am
here
and
not
in
france
frank
is
proud
papa
said
nicole
elysée
nodded
i
fear
he
is
too
often
a
proud
papa
auguste
roared
and
nicole
though
she
blushed
could
not
help
laughing
the
town
grows
bigger
every
year
auguste
said
nicole
nodded
sympathetically
she
seemed
to
have
guessed
what
he
was
thinking
how
numerous
the
whites
were
as
he
had
seen
for
himself
in
the
east
and
how
inexorably
they
were
filling
up
this
part
of
the
country
like
a
river
in
flood
last
year
the
new
york
papers
had
reported
the
results
of
the
census
the
united
states
was
over
twelve
million
auguste
had
read
a
number
he
could
not
even
imagine
and
of
those
were
here
in
the
state
of
illinois
balanced
against
the
six
thousand
sauk
and
fox
black
hawk
people
the
british
band
numbered
only
two
thousand
hopeless
victor
had
a
hundred
or
so
people
the
year
you
came
here
said
elysée
now
there
are
over
four
hundred
as
you
see
the
bluff
is
completely
covered
with
houses
and
we
have
many
new
industries
and
crafts
a
preacher
a
reverend
hale
has
put
up
a
church
on
the
prairie
to
the
east
of
us
i
am
not
sure
whether
his
work
counts
as
an
industry
or
a
craft
there
is
frank
sawmill
as
nicole
said
there
are
also
a
flour
mill
and
a
brewery
and
a
mason
works
at
a
limestone
quarry
nearby
and
your
father
is
planning
to
set
up
a
kiln
on
the
estate
so
we
can
build
a
new
victoire
of
brick
how
sick
is
my
father
auguste
asked
abruptly
dreading
the
answer
he
would
get
ah
nicole
there
are
your
children
waiting
to
greet
us
grandpapa
cried
as
if
he
had
not
heard
auguste
question
where
the
road
made
a
sharp
turn
and
started
upward
on
a
higher
level
stood
a
frame
building
painted
white
a
sign
over
the
door
read
the
victor
visitor
hopkins
pubr
printing
and
engraving
carpentry
auguste
could
hear
the
press
clanking
away
inside
the
house
as
they
approached
the
three
younger
children
john
rachel
and
betsy
were
lined
up
by
the
door
rachel
holding
in
her
arms
a
baby
that
must
be
nicole
and
frank
newest
three
of
the
older
ones
benjamin
abigail
and
martha
leaned
out
a
window
to
wave
to
auguste
from
the
second
story
auguste
felt
proud
of
himself
being
able
to
remember
all
their
names
and
which
was
which
as
guichard
reined
up
the
horse
and
pushed
the
brake
lever
on
the
carriage
the
sound
of
the
press
stopped
and
frank
came
out
through
the
open
door
wiping
his
hands
on
his
leather
apron
his
forehead
was
shiny
with
sweat
the
oldest
son
thomas
followed
him
pushing
his
hands
down
his
own
apron
with
the
same
gesture
auguste
climbed
down
from
the
carriage
and
took
frank
hand
then
shook
with
thomas
and
the
three
little
girls
the
baby
was
patrick
he
learned
he
lightly
rubbed
patrick
fine
hair
no
wonder
the
town
population
grows
so
fast
aunt
nicole
auguste
said
with
a
smile
how
many
more
do
you
think
there
will
be
for
you
and
frank
but
as
he
spoke
his
pleasure
at
his
aunt
handsome
family
was
dimmed
by
the
thought
that
if
all
white
families
were
as
fertile
as
this
there
was
no
hope
at
all
for
the
red
people
none
i
hope
said
frank
firmly
we
got
too
big
a
tribe
as
it
is
aunt
nicole
face
reddened
again
and
auguste
reminded
himself
that
white
women
were
generally
reluctant
to
talk
about
pregnancy
and
childbirth
auguste
recalled
his
mother
sun
woman
speaking
of
a
kind
of
tea
that
would
keep
a
woman
from
getting
pregnant
when
he
went
back
to
saukenuk
he
could
find
out
more
about
it
he
would
surely
come
back
here
to
visit
and
then
he
could
tell
aunt
nicole
about
it
if
white
women
knew
about
that
tea
maybe
there
would
be
fewer
whites
in
years
to
come
and
they
would
not
have
such
a
hunger
for
land
as
they
drove
on
up
the
road
to
the
top
of
the
bluff
auguste
saw
nicole
face
brighten
and
he
turned
to
see
what
she
was
looking
at
a
black
buggy
drawn
by
an
old
gray
horse
was
coming
toward
them
having
just
rounded
the
bend
in
the
road
at
the
trading
post
palisade
auguste
caught
a
glimpse
of
blond
braids
under
a
red
and
white
checkered
bonnet
nicole
said
auguste
here
a
newcomer
to
our
county
i
think
enjoy
meeting
her
ah
yes
said
elysée
reverend
hale
and
his
daughter
mademoiselle
nancy
he
came
here
over
a
year
ago
auguste
declared
the
town
too
corrupt
for
his
church
and
started
holding
services
for
the
farmers
out
on
the
prairie
they
built
him
a
church
about
five
miles
from
town
painted
white
with
a
steeple
one
can
see
for
miles
its
very
simplicity
makes
it
beautiful
nicole
said
as
much
could
be
said
for
nancy
curious
auguste
tried
to
see
the
face
under
the
red
and
white
bonnet
every
day
and
many
times
a
day
he
thought
of
redbird
and
the
joy
they
so
briefly
shared
but
many
of
the
young
white
women
he
had
seen
in
the
past
six
years
had
made
his
heart
beat
faster
just
last
winter
gone
with
a
group
of
his
classmates
to
an
elegant
old
house
on
nassau
street
where
he
discovered
that
the
body
of
a
white
woman
under
her
dress
was
in
all
important
respects
as
interesting
as
the
body
of
a
woman
of
his
own
people
even
though
he
planned
to
leave
victoire
as
soon
as
he
could
he
was
eager
to
meet
the
new
daughter
the
two
carriages
pulled
side
by
side
and
the
drivers
guichard
and
the
reverend
hale
a
man
dressed
in
black
reined
up
for
the
customary
exchange
of
greeting
reverend
hale
miss
hale
elysée
said
may
i
present
my
grandson
auguste
de
marion
the
reverend
stared
at
auguste
for
a
moment
from
under
bushy
brows
before
grunting
an
acknowledgment
auguste
suspected
he
had
heard
about
his
parentage
and
was
looking
for
traces
of
indian
blood
auguste
had
never
heard
that
word
before
he
went
to
live
among
white
people
his
people
were
the
sauk
the
people
of
the
place
of
fire
and
their
allies
were
the
fox
and
besides
these
there
were
winnebago
potawatomi
chippewa
kickapoo
osage
piankeshaw
sioux
shawnee
each
a
separate
people
and
besides
these
hundreds
more
whose
names
he
did
not
even
know
but
the
whites
had
one
name
for
all
these
peoples
indians
and
that
name
grandpapa
had
explained
to
him
with
gentle
irony
was
altogether
a
mistake
the
explorer
columbus
had
thought
he
had
landed
in
india
do
not
even
respect
us
enough
to
call
us
by
an
honest
but
the
sight
of
nancy
hale
drove
the
bitterness
from
his
mind
her
braids
emerging
from
her
red
and
white
bonnet
and
lying
on
either
side
of
her
white
lace
collar
were
yellow
as
ripe
corn
and
her
face
while
too
long
for
ideal
beauty
was
pink
and
clear
her
mouth
was
wide
and
her
teeth
were
white
when
she
smiled
at
nicole
and
elysée
she
looked
straight
at
auguste
for
an
instant
then
she
looked
down
but
in
that
moment
he
saw
eyes
a
vivid
shade
of
blue
like
the
turquoise
stone
from
the
southwest
he
carried
in
his
medicine
bag
visiting
the
members
of
your
flock
are
you
reverend
elysée
asked
auguste
noticed
that
he
put
the
tiniest
humorous
inflection
on
the
word
flock
hale
thick
gray
brows
drew
together
as
he
nodded
sourly
trying
to
bring
the
word
to
that
wilderness
you
call
a
town
here
was
an
unhappy
man
thought
auguste
whose
life
was
dedicated
to
persuading
those
around
him
to
be
equally
unhappy
ah
yes
said
elysée
with
a
broad
smile
quite
a
population
of
sheep
gone
astray
in
victor
in
all
of
smith
county
said
hale
must
scandalize
him
to
think
that
my
mother
is
an
indian
woman
and
that
my
father
by
the
lights
of
this
man
is
even
married
to
auguste
suddenly
wanted
to
defy
the
disapproval
he
felt
from
the
reverend
he
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
and
in
an
instant
was
standing
on
the
road
beside
the
minister
buggy
he
swept
off
his
hat
with
the
flourish
he
seen
in
new
york
and
bowed
deeply
miss
hale
he
said
auguste
de
marion
at
your
service
the
blood
rose
to
nancy
hale
cheeks
my
pleasure
de
marion
she
murmured
her
large
blue
eyes
looked
frightened
and
her
flush
deepened
but
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
away
and
his
gaze
was
locked
to
hers
his
heart
beat
as
hard
as
it
had
the
first
time
he
saw
the
white
bear
the
lord
work
awaits
us
in
victor
said
the
reverend
hale
loudly
you
really
must
excuse
us
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
snapped
the
reins
of
his
buggy
and
the
old
horse
ambled
off
auguste
stood
in
the
road
waiting
to
see
if
nancy
would
glance
back
at
him
she
did
even
at
a
distance
and
through
dust
he
could
see
the
blue
of
her
eyes
elysée
said
well
auguste
close
your
mouth
put
your
hat
back
on
and
get
back
up
here
going
to
meet
her
auguste
thought
he
still
wanted
just
as
much
to
go
back
to
his
people
he
had
not
forgotten
redbird
by
now
though
she
had
probably
forgotten
him
and
so
what
harm
could
there
be
in
getting
to
know
this
white
young
lady
a
little
better
then
their
carriage
was
passing
the
log
wall
around
the
trading
post
a
shadow
fell
over
his
enjoyment
at
meeting
nancy
hale
he
ran
his
finger
down
the
scar
on
his
cheek
is
in
there
he
said
abruptly
to
nicole
her
face
paled
he
down
you
know
about
what
going
on
in
the
rock
river
country
do
you
auguste
stiffened
has
something
happened
to
my
people
he
saw
nicole
close
her
eyes
and
sigh
when
he
said
my
people
there
has
been
trouble
said
elysée
did
no
news
reach
you
in
new
york
earthmaker
let
them
come
to
no
twisting
his
hands
in
his
lap
auguste
said
the
new
york
papers
only
report
what
happens
on
the
eastern
seaboard
he
remembered
now
overhearing
remarks
by
some
of
his
fellow
passengers
on
the
about
injun
trouble
but
he
kept
to
himself
on
the
trip
up
from
louis
steamed
right
past
the
mouth
of
the
rock
river
and
i
never
guessed
elysée
nodded
well
your
father
insisted
that
no
one
write
you
about
it
he
feared
it
would
distract
you
from
your
studies
auguste
felt
a
sudden
flash
of
anger
at
pierre
de
marion
does
want
me
to
forget
that
i
am
a
sauk
not
even
telling
me
when
my
people
are
in
he
gripped
elysée
arm
what
happened
nicole
said
frank
has
a
correspondent
who
writes
him
regularly
from
fort
armstrong
the
american
fort
auguste
remembered
was
at
the
mouth
of
the
rock
river
six
miles
downriver
from
saukenuk
nicole
went
on
black
hawk
band
once
again
crossed
the
mississippi
to
saukenuk
in
the
spring
even
though
the
army
has
told
them
over
and
over
that
the
land
now
belongs
to
the
federal
government
and
they
must
not
return
to
it
this
time
they
found
settlers
actually
living
in
some
of
their
houses
and
farming
their
fields
black
hawk
drove
them
out
black
hawk
warriors
destroyed
settlers
cabins
nearby
shot
their
horses
and
cows
told
them
to
move
away
or
be
killed
now
governor
reynolds
has
called
up
the
militia
to
drive
black
hawk
and
his
people
out
of
illinois
his
proclamation
says
or
alive
auguste
heart
suddenly
felt
as
if
ice
had
formed
around
it
elysée
said
and
raoul
and
most
of
his
cronies
have
gone
to
join
the
militia
auguste
whispered
o
earthmaker
keep
my
people
safe
the
carriage
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
was
passing
the
front
gate
of
the
trading
post
shut
and
locked
with
a
chain
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
redbird
sun
woman
owl
carver
black
hawk
all
the
people
he
had
known
and
loved
all
of
his
life
facing
the
rifles
of
men
like
raoul
i
must
go
there
now
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
ca
nicole
said
quickly
you
ca
get
through
the
militia
lines
you
be
shot
auguste
fists
clenched
in
his
lap
shook
his
head
if
they
are
in
such
danger
how
can
i
stay
away
i
be
with
them
elysée
seized
his
wrist
in
a
grip
so
powerful
it
startled
him
listen
to
me
you
can
not
help
them
you
simply
ca
get
there
before
matters
are
settled
one
way
or
another
and
i
am
sure
that
when
your
chief
black
hawk
sees
the
size
of
the
militia
force
he
will
go
peacefully
back
across
the
mississippi
the
sauk
and
fox
have
many
young
men
you
are
your
father
only
son
needs
you
now
auguste
heart
ached
as
he
saw
the
plea
in
grandpapa
eyes
how
could
he
deny
the
old
man
and
his
father
need
for
the
love
of
his
son
in
his
last
days
but
the
thought
of
thousands
of
armed
and
angry
whites
going
to
drive
his
people
out
of
saukenuk
smote
him
like
a
war
club
grandpapa
know
black
hawk
black
hawk
was
not
likely
to
yield
peaceably
and
whether
or
not
auguste
could
be
any
use
at
saukenuk
he
had
to
be
there
nicole
said
at
least
see
your
father
and
talk
to
him
before
you
decide
what
to
do
auguste
nodded
of
course
he
saw
more
pain
in
her
face
than
he
could
bear
to
look
at
he
turned
to
stare
out
at
the
hills
as
the
carriage
carried
them
to
victoire
now
they
could
see
victoire
the
great
stone
and
log
house
rising
out
of
the
prairie
on
its
low
hill
elysée
and
pierre
liked
to
call
it
a
château
but
auguste
had
learned
that
it
was
nothing
like
the
castles
in
the
land
they
had
come
from
and
much
as
he
had
marveled
at
victoire
when
he
first
saw
it
he
had
seen
still
bigger
and
finer
houses
in
new
york
but
it
was
still
the
grandest
house
north
of
the
rock
mouth
and
auguste
could
help
feeling
proud
when
he
realized
that
the
blood
of
the
men
who
built
it
flowed
in
his
own
veins
their
carriage
rattled
through
the
gateway
in
the
fence
auguste
saw
with
pleasure
that
the
maple
tree
that
shaded
the
south
side
of
the
house
was
bigger
than
ever
most
of
the
servants
and
field
hands
were
gathered
before
the
front
door
to
greet
auguste
he
remembered
how
they
had
assembled
this
way
six
years
ago
when
star
arrow
first
brought
him
here
from
saukenuk
every
time
he
thought
of
saukenuk
of
his
beleaguered
people
surrounded
by
an
enemy
army
his
breathing
grew
fast
and
shallow
but
he
was
frightened
too
by
the
silence
of
the
house
it
whispered
of
his
father
dying
he
must
face
pierre
death
and
suffer
with
him
now
auguste
wanted
to
rush
upstairs
to
pierre
and
hold
him
tight
and
also
he
did
not
want
to
go
into
pierre
room
at
all
auguste
and
elysée
climbed
the
stairway
from
the
great
hall
of
the
château
to
pierre
bedroom
nicole
following
at
the
door
auguste
hesitated
and
elysée
stepped
forward
and
firmly
knocked
a
woman
voice
called
them
in
as
grandpapa
pushed
the
door
open
auguste
closed
his
eyes
he
dreaded
what
he
was
about
to
see
his
heart
fluttered
anxiously
would
there
be
anything
he
wondered
he
could
do
for
his
father
now
the
door
was
fully
open
and
he
saw
the
long
thin
figure
stretched
out
under
a
sheet
on
a
canopied
bed
marchette
was
sitting
with
a
basin
of
water
on
her
knees
she
had
been
wiping
pierre
face
with
a
damp
cloth
a
flash
of
bright
red
caught
auguste
eye
on
the
floor
by
the
bed
was
a
second
basin
partly
covered
by
a
towel
which
auguste
suspected
marchette
must
have
hastily
thrown
over
it
but
part
of
the
towel
had
fallen
into
the
basin
and
blood
was
soaking
into
the
white
linen
a
knot
of
grief
filled
auguste
throat
blocking
it
so
he
could
not
speak
he
rushed
to
the
bed
pierre
lay
on
his
back
his
head
propped
up
by
pillows
his
long
nose
pointing
straight
at
auguste
his
eyes
turned
toward
him
his
bony
hands
looked
very
large
because
his
arms
were
so
thin
pierre
gray
hair
what
was
left
of
it
spread
out
on
the
pillow
pierre
lifted
his
head
a
little
son
oh
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
raised
his
hands
and
auguste
biting
his
lip
leaned
over
the
bed
and
put
his
hands
under
his
father
shoulders
he
held
pierre
close
and
felt
pierre
hands
come
to
rest
on
his
back
light
as
autumn
leaves
they
held
each
other
that
way
for
a
moment
his
father
felt
so
light
as
if
he
was
starving
to
death
auguste
released
him
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
said
the
first
thing
that
came
into
his
mind
did
you
eat
today
father
pierre
voice
was
like
the
wind
in
dead
branches
marchette
keeps
me
alive
with
clear
soups
they
are
all
that
i
can
keep
down
a
bowl
of
broth
auguste
now
saw
stood
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
next
to
the
soup
lay
a
bible
bound
in
black
leather
and
silver
spectacle
case
with
its
velvet
ribbon
what
would
sun
woman
and
owl
carver
do
for
a
man
this
sick
what
would
they
feed
him
maybe
i
can
help
you
father
he
said
i
do
think
anyone
can
help
me
son
pierre
said
it
all
right
just
having
you
here
makes
me
feel
better
auguste
had
learned
enough
about
cancer
to
be
sure
that
condition
was
hopeless
bernard
any
of
the
other
white
physicians
at
new
york
hospital
would
say
that
nothing
more
could
be
done
except
to
make
the
patient
comfortable
give
him
laudanum
perhaps
and
wait
for
the
end
but
that
was
merely
what
white
medicine
had
taught
auguste
white
doctors
had
sharp
lancets
to
draw
blood
scalpels
to
cut
into
sick
people
bodies
saws
to
cut
off
infected
limbs
they
had
huge
thick
books
listing
hundreds
of
diseases
and
prescribing
treatments
for
them
but
after
spending
many
hours
treating
the
sick
in
new
york
auguste
had
seen
that
there
were
many
things
the
white
physicians
did
not
know
how
to
do
had
never
even
thought
of
doing
perhaps
greater
hope
for
pierre
lay
in
the
way
of
the
shaman
at
the
very
least
auguste
as
white
bear
could
speak
to
soul
could
summon
the
aid
of
the
spirits
especially
his
own
spirit
helper
and
that
of
the
sick
man
to
cure
him
if
possible
if
not
then
to
ease
his
suffering
help
him
to
accept
what
was
to
happen
to
him
and
prepare
him
to
walk
in
the
other
world
with
a
jolt
the
thought
hit
him
anew
i
stay
here
with
father
what
of
saukenuk
pierre
said
god
has
kept
me
alive
because
i
must
talk
to
you
about
our
land
auguste
auguste
did
not
like
the
sound
of
that
the
thousands
of
acres
the
de
marions
owned
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
he
wanted
to
keep
it
that
way
marchette
stood
up
pushing
her
chair
back
perhaps
the
rest
of
us
should
leave
you
and
monsieur
auguste
alone
auguste
saw
in
her
face
the
anguish
of
a
woman
who
was
losing
a
man
she
loved
auguste
had
long
suspected
seeing
the
looks
that
passed
between
pierre
and
marchette
and
the
way
her
husband
the
armand
glared
at
both
of
them
that
there
was
or
at
least
had
once
been
something
between
the
master
of
victoire
and
the
cook
pierre
raised
a
tremulous
hand
au
contraire
i
want
the
three
of
you
papa
nicole
marchette
to
hear
what
i
say
besides
you
are
the
three
i
trust
most
i
want
you
to
know
my
wishes
my
true
wishes
because
after
i
am
gone
there
are
those
who
will
lie
about
me
auguste
took
pierre
hand
so
big
and
yet
so
weak
in
his
own
strong
brown
one
father
you
must
believe
that
you
will
live
auguste
heard
the
others
move
closer
to
the
bed
nicole
went
to
stand
at
the
foot
elysée
seated
himself
in
an
old
armchair
brought
over
from
france
his
cane
across
his
knees
pierre
pointed
a
skeletal
finger
above
his
head
to
a
shelf
mounted
on
the
plaster
wall
where
an
indian
pipe
lay
its
bowl
carved
of
red
pipestone
its
stem
polished
hickory
take
down
the
calumet
pierre
said
let
me
hold
it
auguste
took
the
pipe
reverently
with
a
hand
at
each
end
of
its
length
two
black
feathers
with
white
tips
fluttered
from
the
bowl
as
he
put
the
pipe
into
pierre
hands
from
the
moment
he
touched
the
pipe
auguste
hands
were
shaking
as
much
as
pierre
only
he
and
pierre
understood
how
much
power
was
in
this
pipe
power
to
bind
men
for
life
to
whatever
they
promised
when
they
smoked
the
sacred
tobacco
pierre
let
the
pipe
lie
on
his
chest
his
fingers
touching
it
lightly
this
pipe
was
given
me
a
few
years
after
you
were
born
auguste
by
jumping
fish
who
even
then
was
one
of
the
civil
chiefs
of
the
sauk
and
fox
it
is
the
sign
of
an
agreement
between
our
family
and
the
sauk
and
fox
fully
understood
and
freely
entered
into
by
both
sides
auguste
looked
in
wonderment
from
pierre
to
elysée
and
grandpapa
nodded
solemnly
elysée
said
we
had
spent
years
exploring
the
more
unsettled
parts
of
the
illinois
territory
and
we
had
decided
that
here
was
the
land
we
wanted
as
our
family
seat
in
the
new
world
in
we
bought
this
land
for
a
dollar
an
acre
at
the
federal
land
office
in
kaskaskia
thirty
thousand
dollars
the
federal
government
claimed
that
the
sauk
and
fox
had
signed
a
treaty
a
few
years
earlier
with
governor
william
henry
harrison
selling
million
acres
including
all
of
northern
illinois
to
the
united
states
for
a
little
over
two
thousand
dollars
a
shockingly
paltry
sum
pierre
said
but
we
knew
that
the
sauk
and
fox
disputed
that
claim
auguste
said
yes
black
hawk
says
harrison
cheated
the
sauk
and
fox
he
says
the
chiefs
who
signed
the
treaty
were
drunk
and
could
not
speak
english
or
read
or
write
it
and
did
not
know
what
they
were
agreeing
to
when
they
made
their
marks
he
says
that
anyway
those
chiefs
had
no
permission
from
the
tribe
to
sell
any
land
exactly
said
elysée
and
we
wanted
to
live
in
peace
with
the
sauk
and
fox
and
that
was
why
your
father
went
to
saukenuk
we
hoped
to
make
reasonable
payments
for
the
land
we
would
live
on
to
those
from
whom
it
had
been
taken
pierre
said
i
was
still
there
with
your
mother
by
my
own
choice
when
war
broke
out
in
and
then
they
required
me
to
stay
with
them
you
were
already
two
years
old
after
the
war
and
after
i
left
them
i
sent
the
sauk
and
fox
chiefs
what
they
asked
for
thirty
thousand
dollars
partly
in
coin
and
partly
in
trade
goods
knives
steel
axes
tin
pots
and
kettles
blankets
and
bolts
of
cloth
rifles
and
barrels
of
gunpowder
bags
of
bullets
so
we
paid
for
this
land
twice
over
despite
that
i
think
it
is
far
more
valuable
still
than
all
the
money
we
spent
for
it
the
chiefs
recognize
our
right
to
live
on
the
land
and
use
it
and
jumping
fish
gave
me
this
calumet
and
i
gave
him
a
fine
kentucky
long
rifle
with
brass
and
silver
inlay
on
the
barrel
and
stock
auguste
nodded
eagerly
yes
yes
i
seen
it
jumping
fish
uses
it
to
shoot
the
first
buffalo
every
winter
to
start
the
hunt
and
i
gave
black
hawk
the
compass
your
war
chief
still
treasures
from
which
i
received
my
sauk
name
yes
auguste
looked
across
pierre
bed
and
out
the
windows
of
costly
clear
glass
shipped
from
philadelphia
that
gave
a
view
south
across
prairie
once
all
that
prairie
belonged
to
my
people
he
thought
as
if
knowing
his
thoughts
pierre
said
i
did
not
say
the
sauk
and
fox
sold
us
the
land
i
said
they
recognized
our
right
to
use
it
do
you
understand
auguste
nodded
repeating
what
he
had
so
often
heard
black
hawk
say
in
the
tribal
meetings
land
is
not
something
to
be
bought
and
sold
so
we
believe
pierre
closed
his
eyes
wearily
his
fingertips
still
resting
on
the
calumet
that
lay
across
his
chest
auguste
grieved
the
father
who
had
left
him
when
he
was
a
little
boy
and
then
come
back
for
him
was
leaving
him
again
slipping
away
marchette
wiped
pierre
face
with
a
damp
cloth
nicole
lower
lip
trembled
as
she
said
my
big
brother
you
always
been
here
for
me
elysée
face
was
crumpled
by
an
unbearable
sadness
he
wishes
auguste
thought
that
it
was
him
lying
there
dying
instead
of
his
son
pierre
opened
his
eyes
and
lifted
his
head
to
look
at
auguste
auguste
gently
pressed
his
hand
against
his
father
balding
brow
rest
father
rest
not
till
we
are
done
you
know
that
your
grandfather
turned
the
estate
over
to
me
when
i
was
forty
years
of
age
now
i
must
pass
it
on
until
recent
years
i
had
thought
that
the
land
would
go
to
raoul
when
i
died
but
the
enmity
between
me
and
raoul
has
grown
deeper
and
deeper
a
few
times
he
and
i
and
papa
have
met
together
trying
to
come
to
terms
each
time
the
words
that
passed
between
us
were
more
cruel
then
a
year
ago
he
even
boasted
to
me
that
he
killed
three
sauk
indians
who
were
taking
lead
from
that
mine
he
has
been
working
which
they
believe
to
be
theirs
auguste
gasped
fish
and
the
others
that
must
have
been
what
happened
to
pierre
said
what
is
it
i
think
i
know
those
three
one
of
them
was
my
age
and
a
friend
of
mine
his
hatred
for
raoul
burned
fiercer
than
ever
pierre
said
for
a
long
time
now
there
have
been
no
words
at
all
between
raoul
and
me
auguste
said
it
was
my
coming
here
that
turned
you
against
each
other
nicole
spoke
up
not
you
raoul
has
had
a
grudge
against
pierre
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
elysée
said
yes
raoul
has
many
quarrels
with
me
over
land
and
how
it
is
to
be
used
our
paying
the
sauk
and
fox
for
it
the
fort
dearborn
massacre
yes
you
are
part
of
it
auguste
but
there
is
much
more
besides
auguste
shook
his
head
but
before
i
came
father
and
raoul
were
speaking
to
each
other
and
the
question
of
who
would
get
the
estate
was
settled
and
it
still
can
be
father
after
you
are
gone
i
will
go
back
to
my
people
you
can
tell
raoul
that
and
there
will
be
peace
between
you
with
pain
that
tore
all
through
him
like
lightning
burning
through
a
tree
auguste
realized
that
he
had
committed
himself
to
stay
here
as
long
as
his
father
lived
his
sauk
family
and
loved
ones
were
in
terrible
danger
four
days
ride
from
here
and
he
wanted
to
be
with
them
but
he
could
leave
pierre
now
his
fear
for
sun
woman
and
redbird
and
the
others
in
peril
his
shame
at
not
going
to
help
them
would
be
a
terrible
torment
but
he
would
have
to
endure
it
he
could
not
leave
his
father
to
take
his
first
steps
on
the
trail
of
souls
alone
pierre
reached
out
suddenly
and
seized
him
by
the
wrist
you
must
not
leave
even
after
i
am
gone
you
must
stay
here
as
my
heir
auguste
gasped
as
the
enormity
of
what
pierre
was
saying
hit
him
heir
he
tried
to
stand
up
but
pierre
grip
held
him
fast
just
as
this
huge
house
and
all
the
land
around
it
would
hold
him
captive
forever
parted
from
his
people
no
listen
please
auguste
i
can
not
will
the
land
to
raoul
auguste
lifted
his
free
hand
pleadingly
you
ca
will
it
to
i
know
nothing
about
managing
farms
and
raising
livestock
nothing
about
business
raoul
has
been
trained
from
childhood
to
do
all
the
work
of
this
estate
i
ca
do
it
and
i
want
it
he
looked
around
the
room
hoping
the
others
would
help
him
persuade
pierre
that
what
he
wanted
was
impossible
nicole
and
marchette
were
both
and
elysée
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
his
eyes
intent
on
auguste
pierre
said
once
the
land
is
your
responsibility
you
will
do
what
is
right
with
it
i
know
you
will
i
want
to
turn
the
estate
over
to
you
now
as
papa
did
with
me
while
i
am
still
alive
i
would
be
here
to
help
you
for
a
little
while
your
grandfather
will
advise
you
as
he
has
advised
me
all
these
years
there
will
be
others
to
help
you
nicole
her
husband
marchette
guichard
auguste
said
grandpapa
tell
him
i
ca
do
it
elysée
who
had
been
sitting
slumped
and
miserable
in
his
armchair
roused
himself
and
said
i
knew
your
father
was
going
to
propose
this
to
you
today
auguste
this
is
what
he
wants
it
is
no
mere
whim
he
has
been
thinking
about
it
for
a
long
time
and
it
is
not
impossible
you
have
shown
yourself
capable
of
learning
quickly
i
can
only
promise
you
that
if
you
take
up
the
burden
your
father
offers
you
i
will
be
at
your
side
to
help
you
every
way
that
i
can
for
a
moment
elysée
words
made
auguste
resolve
waver
thirty
thousand
acres
he
thought
and
the
united
states
stole
fifty
million
acres
from
my
people
should
not
one
sauk
get
some
of
it
back
but
he
had
some
idea
of
the
crushing
responsibility
a
huge
estate
would
entail
it
was
absurd
to
think
of
himself
occupying
such
a
place
but
raoul
is
also
your
son
grandpapa
he
said
do
you
want
him
to
inherit
your
land
elysée
shook
his
head
raoul
is
a
murderer
many
times
over
who
has
escaped
punishment
only
because
smith
county
is
on
the
frontier
where
there
is
no
law
he
hates
indians
with
a
passion
that
is
close
to
madness
he
is
a
crude
violent
greedy
man
he
shames
our
family
he
is
far
less
worthy
than
you
auguste
felt
anger
boiling
up
under
his
dismay
father
and
sun
woman
and
owl
carver
and
black
hawk
had
promised
him
he
would
live
among
whites
only
for
a
time
and
then
go
back
to
the
sauk
they
had
all
smoked
the
calumet
making
that
agreement
sacred
he
had
lived
for
that
homecoming
through
these
six
years
he
freed
his
wrist
from
pierre
grip
and
held
out
his
hands
pleading
for
understanding
but
i
ca
stay
here
with
white
people
for
the
rest
of
my
life
pierre
said
you
are
not
the
same
person
you
were
when
i
took
you
out
of
the
forest
you
have
been
educated
you
may
yet
become
a
doctor
yes
and
i
want
to
be
a
doctor
for
my
people
you
can
do
more
for
them
if
you
stay
here
my
son
the
sauk
will
need
friends
among
the
whites
who
have
knowledge
and
wealth
and
power
auguste
shook
his
head
violently
as
if
to
drive
out
pierre
words
i
will
never
be
happy
living
as
a
white
man
i
must
go
back
to
my
people
i
beg
you
to
let
me
go
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
realized
with
a
sudden
pang
that
these
loved
ones
pierre
grandpapa
nicole
were
his
people
too
pierre
sunken
eyes
blazed
at
auguste
i
have
already
written
my
new
will
auguste
there
is
one
copy
with
the
town
clerk
burke
russell
and
one
copy
in
your
grandfather
keeping
it
names
you
my
sole
heir
to
all
that
i
possess
the
entire
de
marion
estate
if
you
accept
what
i
am
offering
you
you
will
have
to
fight
raoul
it
will
all
be
upon
your
shoulders
i
can
only
beg
you
with
these
last
breaths
to
take
what
i
would
give
you
you
must
decide
a
voice
inside
auguste
screamed
must
not
do
this
to
me
father
you
will
destroy
he
stood
looking
down
at
his
father
with
his
arms
hanging
at
his
sides
his
shoulders
straight
his
head
bowed
he
could
not
say
no
so
finally
so
bluntly
to
his
dying
father
he
needed
time
to
work
his
way
free
of
this
trap
father
you
know
we
sauk
never
decide
quickly
when
it
is
a
very
important
decision
we
think
we
go
on
with
our
work
we
walk
the
sunwise
circle
we
wait
in
silence
for
the
answer
to
come
you
must
give
me
time
pierre
closed
his
eyes
and
his
head
fell
back
to
the
white
pillows
you
have
as
much
time
as
i
do
he
whispered
but
only
that
much
auguste
turned
away
from
the
bed
his
eyes
met
nicole
he
saw
sympathy
for
him
in
her
face
but
only
another
shaman
could
know
the
pain
he
was
feeling
inside
bequest
white
bear
crouched
over
the
brown
blanket
he
had
brought
down
from
his
room
and
unrolled
it
and
barefoot
in
white
sailcloth
workman
trousers
he
had
bought
in
new
york
he
took
from
the
blanket
roll
his
powerful
necklace
of
megis
shells
and
hung
it
around
his
neck
next
he
opened
his
soft
leather
medicine
bag
propped
up
against
the
big
old
maple
tree
on
the
south
side
of
victoire
pierre
lay
on
his
mattress
with
his
head
and
shoulders
resting
on
pillows
his
cotton
blanket
all
he
needed
on
this
warm
september
day
was
tucked
around
his
chest
leaving
his
arms
free
he
had
begged
to
be
taken
outside
the
weather
was
so
fine
as
soon
as
the
servants
had
carried
him
out
and
left
him
and
white
bear
alone
he
had
fallen
asleep
these
days
pierre
slept
most
of
the
time
as
a
baby
would
but
a
baby
slept
to
build
up
its
strength
pierre
because
he
was
losing
strength
white
bear
he
did
not
think
of
himself
as
auguste
now
laid
out
the
objects
from
his
medicine
bag
on
the
unrolled
blanket
and
contemplated
them
they
represented
the
seven
sacred
directions
first
east
he
picked
up
a
sparkling
white
rock
and
placed
it
on
the
east
side
of
the
tree
the
color
of
east
was
white
and
therefore
was
white
bear
own
color
next
was
south
he
took
up
the
green
stone
on
which
the
mound
builders
had
long
ago
carved
the
figure
of
a
winged
man
this
he
laid
on
the
earth
next
to
the
mattress
on
pierre
left
side
the
ground
under
the
maple
tree
was
bare
and
an
early
morning
rain
had
left
it
damp
and
soft
now
west
the
spirits
of
men
and
women
went
west
when
they
died
and
the
color
of
west
was
red
he
set
the
red
stone
with
dark
honeycomb
markings
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
painted
on
its
highly
polished
surface
on
the
ground
at
pierre
feet
by
the
north
side
of
the
mattress
he
placed
a
black
stone
itself
from
the
north
that
owl
carver
had
engraved
with
an
owl
image
the
fifth
direction
up
was
blue
and
he
put
a
blue
stone
the
color
of
nancy
hale
eyes
on
the
pillow
beside
pierre
head
he
set
a
piece
of
brown
sandstone
for
the
sixth
direction
down
beside
pierre
feet
now
for
the
seventh
sacred
direction
here
he
picked
up
the
last
and
largest
item
from
his
medicine
bag
the
claw
of
a
grizzly
bear
that
had
been
killed
by
black
hawk
himself
many
years
ago
after
white
bear
had
come
back
from
his
first
spirit
quest
with
the
prediction
that
black
hawk
would
do
deeds
of
courage
and
that
his
name
would
never
be
forgotten
the
war
chief
had
made
him
a
gift
of
the
grizzly
claw
white
bear
laid
the
claw
on
pierre
chest
over
his
heart
with
the
brown
tip
toward
the
cancerous
lump
in
pierre
belly
that
was
killing
him
he
went
back
to
his
blanket
and
took
out
a
dried
gourd
painted
black
and
white
slapping
the
gourd
against
the
palm
of
his
hand
to
make
it
rattle
he
danced
in
a
circle
around
pierre
and
the
maple
tree
sunwise
from
east
to
south
to
west
to
north
and
back
to
east
again
keeping
pierre
on
his
right
singing
softly
almost
to
himself
earthmaker
you
made
this
man
now
we
ask
your
help
for
him
he
is
a
chief
whose
people
need
him
he
still
has
far
to
walk
lift
him
up
earthmaker
give
him
back
his
life
when
white
bear
had
danced
the
circle
nine
times
he
put
down
the
gourd
he
had
brought
out
from
the
château
a
kettle
of
freshly
brewed
tea
and
a
porcelain
cup
it
would
ease
the
pain
in
stomach
and
give
him
strength
whenever
pierre
ate
solid
food
blood
would
come
trickling
out
of
every
opening
in
his
body
and
he
would
grow
weaker
and
paler
he
was
slowly
bleeding
and
starving
to
death
smelling
the
tea
as
he
poured
it
into
the
cup
white
bear
remembered
how
he
met
nancy
hale
when
he
was
collecting
the
bark
yesterday
along
the
bank
of
red
creek
she
been
blueberrying
it
was
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
he
encountered
her
over
the
summer
on
the
prairie
near
victoire
the
meetings
were
accidents
not
for
either
of
them
but
he
felt
so
uncertain
about
what
he
would
do
when
pierre
died
that
he
could
only
talk
with
nancy
about
things
of
no
importance
he
looked
up
to
see
his
father
eyes
open
they
had
sunk
so
far
back
in
the
face
that
they
seemed
like
embers
glowing
in
caves
white
bear
blew
on
the
steaming
cup
and
held
it
to
pierre
lips
he
drank
the
tea
down
in
small
sips
pierre
smiled
faintly
as
his
eyes
traveled
over
his
land
the
nearby
ground
covered
with
grass
cropped
short
by
sheep
and
goats
sloped
down
to
the
fence
that
surrounded
the
château
inner
yard
to
the
west
white
bear
could
see
the
two
flags
flying
over
raoul
trading
post
on
the
bluff
overlooking
the
river
and
beyond
that
part
of
the
river
and
the
dark
west
bank
the
ioway
country
in
the
other
directions
were
orchards
farmlands
pastures
and
the
prairie
yellowing
with
fall
rolling
on
to
the
edge
of
the
sky
when
pierre
had
drunk
most
of
the
tea
white
bear
put
down
the
cup
he
gathered
up
his
sacred
stones
and
put
them
back
in
his
medicine
bag
pierre
said
you
did
a
sauk
ritual
for
me
just
now
did
you
not
yes
said
white
bear
it
was
meant
to
heal
you
or
if
not
to
give
you
strength
to
bear
the
pain
i
do
feel
better
today
pierre
said
but
i
must
also
have
a
certain
rite
of
the
church
if
i
am
to
pass
over
into
god
love
i
sent
a
week
ago
to
kaskaskia
for
your
old
teacher
père
isaac
he
should
be
here
any
day
i
have
been
a
great
sinner
white
bear
it
gladdened
white
bear
heart
that
his
father
called
him
by
his
sauk
name
you
are
a
man
my
father
he
said
in
the
sauk
tongue
pierre
raised
his
head
and
white
bear
saw
that
the
effort
pained
him
the
burning
sunken
eyes
turned
on
white
bear
son
i
must
have
my
answer
now
earthmaker
let
me
live
all
summer
that
you
might
have
time
to
decide
now
you
must
tell
me
can
you
not
let
me
go
back
to
my
people
father
why
do
you
ask
me
to
stay
here
and
fight
for
something
i
do
not
want
i
see
what
raoul
has
become
and
i
do
not
want
him
to
be
the
master
here
i
am
proud
of
you
and
ashamed
of
him
i
want
you
to
be
the
future
of
the
de
marions
not
him
and
what
of
this
land
that
we
have
loved
together
the
land
that
sun
woman
people
have
cherished
for
generations
shall
it
fall
to
raoul
white
bear
remembered
what
owl
carver
had
said
to
pierre
at
saukenuk
your
land
keeps
you
from
doing
what
you
want
then
it
you
why
could
you
will
the
estate
to
nicole
she
a
de
marion
nicole
can
not
do
battle
with
raoul
when
she
has
eight
children
to
care
for
her
husband
is
an
excellent
man
but
not
a
fighter
white
bear
you
are
the
only
one
i
still
think
as
a
sauk
father
among
the
sauk
one
man
may
not
own
land
and
to
claim
so
much
would
be
a
great
crime
in
you
the
heritage
of
the
de
marions
and
the
sauk
claim
to
this
land
are
indissolubly
united
you
will
be
doing
this
for
the
sauk
as
well
as
for
me
and
for
yourself
i
believe
that
it
was
god
plan
that
i
father
you
that
you
spend
the
first
fifteen
years
of
your
life
among
the
sauk
and
then
these
past
six
as
a
white
now
you
have
a
chance
to
be
rich
and
to
have
power
you
can
learn
how
to
use
your
wealth
to
protect
your
people
you
can
do
much
for
them
if
you
stay
here
and
fight
for
what
i
give
you
standing
over
his
father
white
bear
lifted
his
head
and
gazed
up
at
the
great
stone
and
log
house
on
the
hilltop
he
wondered
whether
he
was
not
being
foolishly
stubborn
refusing
victoire
and
the
land
the
château
governed
pierre
looked
sad
and
weak
and
very
old
all
summer
long
white
bear
heartbroken
had
watched
him
suffer
and
diminish
he
knew
he
could
do
nothing
to
cure
his
father
and
that
his
refusal
to
give
him
the
answer
he
wanted
to
hear
was
prolonging
his
pain
white
bear
felt
he
would
agree
to
anything
if
only
it
would
give
peace
looking
into
his
father
pleading
face
he
saw
that
pierre
was
using
up
his
last
strength
white
bear
could
not
let
the
final
word
pierre
might
hear
from
him
be
no
white
bear
could
no
longer
separate
his
own
anguish
from
pierre
he
drew
a
deep
breath
in
through
his
nostrils
yes
father
i
agree
i
will
take
what
you
offer
me
the
look
on
pierre
face
was
like
a
sunrise
white
bear
saw
a
warm
pink
color
flowing
back
into
the
pallid
cheeks
pierre
took
white
bear
hand
his
touch
felt
cool
but
his
grip
was
firm
thank
you
my
son
i
will
walk
the
trail
of
souls
with
a
happy
heart
you
will
go
in
peace
but
i
must
stay
to
fight
and
white
bear
thought
but
he
was
glad
that
he
could
make
his
father
happy
he
leaned
back
against
the
tree
and
watched
huge
white
clouds
drift
over
the
distant
river
let
us
make
this
a
sacred
agreement
son
pierre
said
bring
the
calumet
and
let
us
smoke
together
yes
father
white
bear
sighed
and
stood
up
slowly
as
if
he
were
dragging
chains
he
walked
up
the
grassy
slope
to
the
front
door
of
the
house
as
he
passed
through
the
great
hall
he
saw
armand
perrault
seeming
almost
as
broad
as
he
was
tall
staring
at
him
armand
eyes
were
as
small
and
full
of
hatred
as
a
cornered
boar
feeling
a
chill
realizing
this
man
was
one
of
those
he
would
have
to
fight
when
the
time
came
white
bear
nodded
to
him
as
he
went
up
the
stairs
to
room
armand
stood
motionless
a
short
time
later
white
bear
was
back
at
pierre
side
with
the
calumet
and
a
lit
candle
protected
by
a
glass
chimney
from
his
own
room
he
had
brought
down
the
deerskin
pouch
holding
his
small
supply
of
turkish
tobacco
purchased
in
new
york
it
would
serve
all
tobacco
was
a
sacred
gift
of
earthmaker
he
dribbled
the
moist
brown
grains
through
his
fingertips
into
the
pipe
narrow
bowl
and
packed
the
tobacco
down
gently
pierre
faded
blue
eyes
the
whites
a
sickly
yellow
color
watched
him
closely
he
held
the
candle
flame
to
the
tobacco
and
drew
in
a
series
of
rapid
puffs
feeling
the
smoke
burning
his
mouth
when
the
pipe
was
he
turned
it
and
held
the
mouthpiece
to
pierre
lips
pierre
took
a
long
puff
held
it
in
his
mouth
and
let
it
out
white
bear
heart
lurched
with
fear
as
pierre
began
to
cough
holding
his
throat
with
one
hand
pierre
gestured
with
his
other
hand
for
white
bear
to
draw
on
the
pipe
the
sight
of
beads
of
blood
on
his
father
lips
horrified
white
bear
he
took
a
corner
of
pierre
blanket
and
wiped
away
the
bright
red
drops
then
he
took
the
pipe
from
his
father
hands
grieving
for
the
freedom
he
was
giving
up
he
pulled
the
hot
smoke
in
till
it
filled
his
mouth
he
let
its
bitterness
sink
into
his
tongue
as
bitterness
sank
into
his
heart
the
realization
that
this
promise
would
cut
him
off
forever
from
redbird
from
sun
woman
from
owl
carver
from
the
life
he
longed
to
return
to
he
let
the
smoke
out
with
a
long
sigh
and
laid
the
pipe
down
he
felt
as
if
his
life
was
over
but
he
felt
some
relief
too
because
he
was
no
longer
torn
by
indecision
now
pierre
and
he
were
content
to
talk
of
small
things
how
full
the
corn
bins
were
this
year
what
white
bear
had
seen
and
heard
in
new
york
city
whether
it
would
rain
again
tomorrow
pierre
voice
grew
softer
and
softer
and
gradually
he
drifted
off
to
sleep
his
grip
on
white
bear
hand
was
still
strong
white
bear
let
his
head
rest
against
the
tree
trunk
and
returned
to
a
favorite
childhood
pastime
trying
to
see
animal
shapes
in
the
clouds
he
was
not
surprised
when
the
bear
appeared
at
his
side
the
huge
head
covered
with
fur
white
as
the
clouds
pushed
past
him
poking
its
black
nose
into
pierre
shoulder
somehow
white
bear
knew
that
pierre
would
feel
no
fear
when
he
awoke
even
though
he
had
never
seen
the
bear
before
pierre
eyes
opened
and
he
looked
up
at
the
bear
and
as
white
bear
had
expected
only
sighed
and
smiled
eh
bien
je
suis
content
and
pierre
got
to
his
feet
as
easily
as
if
he
had
never
been
sick
pierre
did
not
say
but
white
bear
had
not
expected
him
to
they
had
said
their
already
white
bear
remained
where
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
maple
tree
with
his
left
hand
lifted
to
rest
on
the
high
hump
at
the
shoulder
pierre
walked
down
the
slope
white
bear
saw
rising
from
the
rim
of
the
hill
the
arc
of
a
rainbow
pierre
walked
the
rainbow
path
with
the
long
vigorous
stride
of
a
young
man
the
bear
accompanied
him
with
a
rolling
gait
looking
like
the
biggest
dog
that
ever
lived
walking
beside
a
hunter
white
bear
smiled
to
watch
them
they
climbed
the
archway
of
color
that
leaped
out
over
the
great
river
until
at
last
they
disappeared
in
the
dazzling
disk
of
the
sun
white
bear
head
fell
back
against
the
bark
of
the
tree
and
he
closed
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them
again
his
father
was
lying
beside
him
still
holding
his
hand
but
pierre
grip
was
without
strength
he
lay
with
his
head
sunk
in
the
pillow
his
mouth
fallen
open
the
whites
of
his
eyes
showing
between
lids
he
was
not
breathing
white
bear
tears
came
hot
he
heard
a
voice
his
own
voice
rising
in
his
chest
it
was
the
sound
mourners
made
at
sauk
funerals
he
wrapped
his
arms
around
his
knees
and
rocked
back
and
forth
sobbing
and
keening
in
the
way
of
his
people
soon
he
would
have
to
get
up
and
go
into
the
château
and
tell
people
pierre
de
marion
was
dead
he
must
be
the
first
to
bring
the
news
to
poor
grandpapa
but
for
a
while
he
would
sit
alone
with
his
father
and
wail
for
him
sitting
on
the
ground
under
the
maple
tree
he
looked
down
and
was
not
surprised
to
see
marks
in
the
bare
damp
earth
the
prints
of
wide
pads
twice
the
size
of
a
man
feet
at
the
end
of
each
print
deep
holes
left
by
five
claws
raoul
did
not
think
he
could
put
up
with
much
more
of
this
funeral
he
had
to
wait
till
it
was
all
over
before
he
could
make
himself
master
of
victoire
and
he
wanted
desperately
to
act
now
he
tried
to
calm
himself
by
remembering
the
indians
he
stalked
and
killed
at
saukenuk
last
may
and
june
raoul
and
the
fifty
men
he
recruited
to
represent
smith
county
in
the
state
militia
had
arrived
at
the
rock
river
in
style
carried
up
the
mississippi
from
victor
to
fort
armstrong
at
the
mouth
of
the
rock
river
on
raoul
new
steamer
paid
for
with
the
profits
of
the
lead
mine
the
was
propelled
by
two
side
paddle
wheels
and
it
could
make
the
round
trip
in
exactly
a
week
they
come
to
hunt
indians
and
raoul
had
made
sure
they
did
camping
in
the
woods
on
the
south
side
of
the
rock
river
opposite
the
indian
village
and
shooting
at
redskins
whenever
they
had
a
chance
it
pleased
raoul
to
think
they
gotten
half
a
dozen
maybe
more
finally
fed
up
with
talking
general
gaines
had
ordered
a
general
assault
on
black
hawk
town
at
the
end
of
june
the
militia
were
eager
to
slaughter
every
indian
in
saukenuk
and
they
swept
in
and
the
damned
sneaking
redskins
were
gone
seeing
themselves
outnumbered
they
slipped
out
of
the
village
down
the
rock
river
and
across
the
mississippi
the
night
before
the
smith
county
boys
along
with
the
other
militiamen
were
in
a
fury
of
frustration
they
had
to
be
content
with
the
satisfaction
of
burning
the
indian
town
to
the
ground
to
raoul
great
annoyance
instead
of
pursuing
black
hawk
gaines
sent
a
message
to
the
chief
asking
for
yet
another
parley
black
hawk
and
some
of
his
braves
came
back
across
the
river
to
talk
peace
just
like
he
had
shown
the
whole
world
what
a
coward
he
really
was
the
stubborn
old
indian
had
marched
up
to
gaines
tent
walking
like
a
peacock
with
feathers
in
his
hair
the
redskinned
son
of
a
was
what
raoul
thought
instead
gaines
just
made
him
sign
another
fool
treaty
as
if
the
indians
ever
honored
any
treaties
and
even
promised
to
send
them
corn
because
they
had
had
time
to
plant
any
the
disgusted
militiamen
called
it
the
corn
treaty
old
gaines
must
be
almost
as
big
a
coward
as
black
hawk
raoul
and
the
smith
county
boys
hung
around
the
rock
river
sniping
at
indians
in
canoes
till
their
provisions
ran
out
they
flagged
the
down
on
her
next
northbound
trip
and
rode
her
home
home
where
what
was
going
on
made
raoul
madder
than
ever
pierre
was
dying
and
the
mongrel
from
the
same
tribe
raoul
had
been
fighting
down
on
the
rock
river
was
strutting
around
as
if
he
already
owned
victoire
that
would
end
today
if
raoul
could
pull
it
off
raoul
eyed
nancy
hale
standing
only
a
few
feet
from
him
among
the
two
hundred
or
so
mourners
in
the
great
hall
of
victoire
what
would
she
think
raoul
wondered
when
he
played
his
hand
today
he
pictured
what
the
tall
blond
woman
would
look
like
naked
under
him
in
bed
oh
he
make
her
sweat
and
moan
and
thank
him
for
it
but
first
of
course
he
had
to
succeed
today
he
had
to
drive
the
mongrel
away
before
he
could
court
nancy
whether
her
preacher
father
approved
of
him
or
not
he
could
turn
away
one
of
the
biggest
landowners
in
illinois
and
that
what
he
be
after
today
he
did
see
how
he
could
fail
surely
the
servants
and
the
townspeople
would
take
the
mongrel
part
still
warming
himself
by
staring
at
nancy
hale
straight
back
raoul
thanked
god
he
never
been
quite
able
to
bring
himself
to
marry
clarissa
he
felt
a
twinge
of
unease
as
he
recalled
that
taking
up
with
nancy
would
mean
kicking
clarissa
out
of
his
bed
and
might
mean
trouble
with
eli
to
his
relief
eli
had
accepted
raoul
not
marrying
clarissa
even
after
she
bore
him
two
kids
but
that
was
only
because
eli
figured
it
would
happen
eventually
maybe
after
raoul
got
control
of
the
estate
well
once
he
had
the
estate
he
comforted
himself
he
could
see
that
clarissa
and
their
two
boys
were
well
taken
care
of
it
galled
raoul
to
be
so
dependent
on
a
man
like
eli
to
be
he
hated
to
admit
it
to
himself
afraid
of
him
a
heap
depended
on
eli
playing
his
part
today
in
helping
him
get
control
of
the
estate
today
eli
would
be
leading
the
smith
county
boys
ones
who
been
at
the
rock
river
last
june
having
been
offered
a
good
day
pay
they
would
do
a
little
more
indian
fighting
raoul
felt
as
if
he
were
going
to
burst
he
could
stand
this
waiting
while
the
priest
droned
on
in
singsong
latin
at
the
table
that
had
been
set
up
as
an
altar
before
the
fireplace
let
the
fight
begin
for
god
sake
are
all
cowards
at
heart
when
i
take
over
here
precious
little
red
bastard
will
slink
away
like
black
hawk
did
last
a
chill
spread
across
raoul
back
as
he
asked
himself
what
if
auguste
does
slink
away
he
might
try
to
rally
the
servants
and
some
of
the
townspeople
to
fight
for
him
they
would
fight
for
a
mongrel
bastard
people
hated
indians
look
how
many
men
rushed
down
to
the
rock
river
to
fight
black
hawk
but
many
people
had
loved
pierre
this
hall
was
filled
and
there
were
more
people
outside
who
could
get
in
because
there
was
room
all
of
them
paying
their
last
respects
to
pierre
and
they
knew
that
pierre
wanted
auguste
to
take
his
place
would
any
of
them
fight
to
see
that
pierre
will
was
done
he
felt
colder
still
as
he
considered
the
odds
just
about
every
man
in
smith
county
had
his
own
rifle
or
pistol
and
raoul
and
the
men
recruited
for
today
were
far
outnumbered
he
wished
he
had
hired
more
men
but
too
many
and
the
secret
would
be
out
and
then
auguste
would
be
ready
for
him
raoul
tried
to
calm
himself
everyone
in
smith
county
might
be
armed
he
reasoned
but
not
everyone
wanted
to
use
their
weapons
a
lot
of
men
would
fight
unless
their
backs
were
to
the
wall
it
was
the
ones
who
were
willing
to
fight
who
got
to
give
orders
to
the
rest
the
men
raoul
had
picked
eli
and
hodge
and
the
rest
of
them
were
born
fighters
there
be
those
who
would
condemn
him
he
thought
for
seizing
the
land
the
very
day
of
his
brother
funeral
it
was
indecent
he
admitted
to
himself
but
he
had
no
choice
he
could
allow
auguste
to
get
his
feet
planted
firmly
he
could
allow
pierre
will
to
be
read
aloud
he
felt
even
better
when
he
remembered
that
with
pierre
dead
the
servants
would
be
taking
their
orders
from
armand
he
looked
around
the
hall
for
the
overseer
there
he
was
near
the
door
most
of
his
face
buried
by
his
thick
brown
beard
armand
wife
marchette
was
standing
next
to
him
sporting
a
black
eye
raoul
noticed
with
amusement
armand
perrault
was
one
who
did
love
pierre
that
sanctimonious
hypocrite
pierre
first
the
squaw
the
mother
then
he
marries
and
as
soon
as
she
dies
putting
it
to
the
cook
raoul
took
a
deep
breath
of
relief
when
he
saw
that
père
isaac
had
finally
finished
with
the
funeral
mass
the
old
jesuit
was
again
sprinkling
holy
water
on
the
coffin
heaped
with
wreaths
of
roses
and
chrysanthemums
that
lay
on
trestles
in
the
center
of
the
hall
frank
hopkins
raoul
knew
had
built
that
coffin
of
oak
planks
old
guichard
came
up
to
raoul
your
father
requests
that
you
be
one
of
those
who
carries
your
brother
coffin
to
the
wagon
raoul
felt
a
momentary
jolt
of
fear
help
pick
up
pierre
coffin
and
carry
it
when
he
was
about
to
dispossess
pierre
son
if
he
laid
a
hand
on
pierre
coffin
god
might
strike
him
dead
or
pierre
ghost
would
rise
up
against
him
he
shook
his
head
fool
thinking
i
would
have
it
any
other
way
guichard
he
was
angered
to
see
auguste
standing
opposite
him
when
he
went
to
the
head
of
the
coffin
it
was
infuriating
to
see
pierre
features
in
that
face
the
was
wearing
a
green
clawhammer
jacket
with
a
black
silk
band
around
the
left
arm
his
arms
and
back
strained
as
they
took
the
weight
of
his
corner
of
the
coffin
a
chorus
of
grunts
arose
from
raoul
auguste
armand
frank
hopkins
jacques
manette
and
kobell
as
they
hoisted
the
coffin
to
their
shoulders
they
trudged
out
the
door
with
it
and
slid
it
on
the
bed
of
a
farm
wagon
guichard
helped
elysée
climb
up
on
the
wagon
a
snap
of
the
old
servant
whip
started
the
two
horses
moving
as
black
ribbons
tied
to
their
harnesses
fluttered
raoul
walked
alone
following
the
cart
the
half
mile
south
along
the
bluffs
to
the
burial
ground
some
of
the
hands
had
cut
a
track
through
the
prairie
grass
for
the
funeral
procession
to
follow
the
fiddler
registre
bosquet
marched
right
behind
the
wagon
playing
hymns
and
the
servants
sang
in
french
raoul
cast
his
eye
back
over
the
long
line
of
people
following
the
coffin
his
glance
slid
past
nicole
and
frank
and
their
passel
of
kids
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
he
saw
two
of
his
key
men
walking
near
the
end
of
the
procession
justus
bennett
the
county
land
commissioner
and
burke
russell
the
county
clerk
one
copy
of
pierre
will
was
in
russell
keeping
and
raoul
had
already
told
him
what
to
do
with
that
russell
wife
pamela
was
walking
beside
him
a
handsome
woman
with
chestnut
hair
that
she
did
braid
as
most
women
did
but
allowed
to
fall
in
soft
waves
under
her
hat
strongly
attracted
to
her
himself
raoul
wondered
how
a
bespectacled
weakling
like
burke
russell
had
ever
been
able
to
attract
such
a
woman
and
what
she
do
if
she
had
a
sporting
proposition
from
an
equally
man
they
were
at
the
cemetery
now
raoul
liked
this
hillside
rising
out
of
the
bluffs
where
pierre
wife
lay
overlooking
the
bottomland
and
the
river
the
graves
of
about
a
dozen
others
who
had
worked
and
died
at
victoire
were
surrounded
by
a
low
fence
tall
cedar
trees
shadowed
the
white
gravestones
the
flat
markers
with
their
rounded
tops
names
dates
and
inscriptions
were
chiseled
by
warren
wilgus
the
mason
who
recently
moved
into
the
area
auguste
had
already
made
arrangements
to
have
pierre
headstone
carved
the
sight
of
a
solid
limestone
cube
in
the
center
of
the
cemetery
gave
raoul
a
twinge
of
guilt
as
it
always
did
it
was
the
first
stone
to
have
been
placed
in
the
cemetery
and
was
a
memorial
to
his
mother
estelle
de
marion
who
was
buried
not
here
but
in
kaskaskia
where
she
had
died
in
giving
birth
to
him
was
my
fault
helene
was
also
remembered
though
not
buried
here
the
indians
had
thrown
her
poor
mutilated
body
into
lake
michigan
her
memorial
marker
stood
next
to
maman
stone
a
carved
angel
spread
his
wings
over
helene
name
and
dates
helene
de
marion
vaillancourt
beloved
daughter
and
sister
she
sings
before
the
throne
of
god
below
that
were
inscribed
the
name
and
dates
of
her
husband
henri
vaillancourt
whose
body
also
had
never
been
found
raoul
carried
inside
himself
his
own
inscription
for
helene
by
indians
august
she
will
be
and
one
act
of
vengeance
would
take
place
today
when
the
mongrel
whose
presence
was
an
affront
to
helene
was
thrown
off
this
land
it
gave
raoul
an
uneasy
feeling
to
be
working
with
auguste
lifting
pierre
coffin
off
the
wagon
it
might
be
bad
luck
but
the
time
to
strike
had
not
yet
come
so
he
had
to
walk
beside
auguste
carrying
the
coffin
to
the
newly
dug
grave
there
crouching
in
unison
the
six
pallbearers
laid
the
coffin
on
a
cradle
of
two
ropes
each
end
held
by
two
servants
over
the
oblong
pit
bending
to
let
his
burden
down
hurt
raoul
back
and
he
glanced
over
at
auguste
hoping
to
see
him
having
trouble
but
the
mongrel
dark
face
was
impassive
when
raoul
saw
elysée
shuffling
through
the
gate
leaning
on
his
walking
stick
he
felt
a
new
tingle
of
dread
how
would
his
father
greet
the
move
he
was
going
to
make
except
for
a
few
brief
and
bitter
meetings
at
which
he
and
papa
and
pierre
had
tried
and
failed
to
settle
their
differences
he
had
not
spoken
to
his
father
in
six
years
armand
often
brought
infuriating
news
of
the
old
man
growing
fondness
for
the
mongrel
making
raoul
hate
the
redskinned
bastard
all
the
more
elysée
would
hardly
be
happy
with
what
he
did
today
of
course
but
would
papa
try
to
fight
his
only
surviving
son
if
he
did
raoul
would
have
to
fight
back
and
then
he
might
be
punished
by
god
god
does
side
with
indians
what
i
am
doing
is
right
because
pierre
was
seduced
and
but
it
would
hurt
to
try
to
get
in
good
with
the
old
man
raoul
walked
quickly
over
to
him
take
my
arm
papa
elysée
looked
up
at
him
his
eyes
bloodshot
and
his
face
blank
his
skin
wrinkled
parchment
old
man
had
his
share
of
grief
too
bad
he
could
find
reason
to
be
happy
with
me
but
that
his
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
elysée
said
thank
you
son
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
today
raoul
sensed
an
accusation
why
would
i
come
to
my
own
brother
funeral
because
you
hated
him
elysée
said
softly
at
least
the
old
man
did
seem
to
suspect
that
he
had
another
reason
for
being
here
today
containing
his
anger
raoul
helped
his
father
walk
to
the
grave
there
he
left
elysée
with
guichard
and
went
around
to
stand
facing
north
where
he
could
see
the
château
his
nagging
fear
eased
a
little
so
far
he
had
seen
no
sign
that
he
would
meet
with
any
opposition
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
the
mongrel
and
his
supporters
could
be
planning
anything
in
secret
still
he
knew
his
heart
would
not
slow
down
till
this
was
all
over
père
isaac
stood
at
the
head
of
pierre
grave
next
to
tombstone
a
faint
breeze
from
the
river
did
disturb
his
hair
or
his
beard
but
rustled
the
tassels
of
the
purple
stole
around
his
neck
the
winglike
sleeves
of
his
white
surplice
and
his
black
cassock
trying
to
hold
still
as
his
heart
pounded
and
his
hands
trembled
raoul
watched
père
isaac
shake
holy
water
over
the
coffin
which
now
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
grave
the
priest
gave
his
sprinkler
to
one
of
the
boys
assisting
him
opened
a
prayerbook
bound
in
black
leather
and
began
the
graveside
prayers
this
never
end
raoul
stood
with
his
head
bowed
he
puzzled
over
what
elysée
had
said
about
hating
pierre
always
loved
pierre
more
than
me
thought
i
was
some
kind
of
savage
because
i
do
have
all
those
french
ways
like
him
and
pierre
i
the
most
american
member
of
this
family
and
he
should
be
proud
of
did
hate
pierre
it
was
just
this
damn
business
of
him
caring
more
about
redskins
than
about
his
own
he
was
there
when
i
needed
raoul
found
himself
wishing
he
could
talk
to
pierre
one
last
time
try
to
make
him
understand
why
he
felt
as
he
did
and
had
to
do
the
things
he
did
looking
down
at
the
coffin
in
the
grave
raoul
thought
back
to
the
last
time
he
had
seen
pierre
in
early
spring
after
the
last
of
the
snow
melted
on
the
ground
out
riding
banner
on
the
prairie
alone
he
come
upon
pierre
also
riding
alone
they
had
stared
at
each
other
and
passed
without
a
word
did
know
then
that
was
my
last
chance
to
speak
to
raoul
eyes
traveled
over
the
people
standing
by
the
grave
auguste
stood
between
elysée
and
nicole
looking
down
into
the
pit
it
pleased
raoul
to
see
that
apparently
auguste
had
no
idea
what
was
about
to
happen
to
him
but
how
could
he
be
auguste
was
unprepared
raoul
looked
over
the
heads
of
the
mourners
and
his
heart
beat
faster
with
anticipation
there
across
the
flat
prairie
land
he
saw
tiny
figures
surrounding
the
château
raoul
fingernails
dug
into
his
palms
as
he
clenched
his
fists
to
hold
himself
together
what
if
the
secret
had
gotten
out
if
auguste
knew
what
was
about
to
happen
he
would
surely
have
prepared
some
kind
of
counterattack
indians
were
damned
sly
père
isaac
closed
his
prayerbook
and
put
it
into
his
coat
pocket
this
man
whom
we
consign
to
american
soil
was
like
so
many
of
us
born
on
the
other
side
of
the
ocean
he
said
he
came
of
one
of
the
oldest
and
noblest
families
of
france
fleeing
the
godless
revolution
that
tormented
their
homeland
which
was
also
my
homeland
the
de
marions
gave
themselves
soul
and
body
to
this
new
land
where
they
had
to
make
their
own
way
here
titles
and
ancient
lineage
meant
nothing
on
with
it
dammit
god
saw
fit
to
try
them
sorely
after
they
came
here
to
illinois
the
mother
of
the
family
died
in
childbirth
a
daughter
died
a
horrid
death
at
the
hands
of
indians
and
a
son
he
gestured
at
raoul
who
stared
back
at
him
keeping
his
face
expressionless
held
captive
a
slave
by
indians
for
two
years
it
was
good
that
père
isaac
mentioned
that
it
would
prepare
people
to
accept
what
was
about
to
happen
pierre
de
marion
was
a
good
man
but
he
was
also
a
sinner
like
all
of
us
he
fell
into
the
sin
of
lust
and
that
sin
bore
fruit
but
pierre
did
not
hide
his
sin
as
so
many
men
have
he
reached
out
to
his
son
through
me
and
helped
him
eventually
he
acknowledged
his
son
and
brought
him
out
of
the
wilderness
to
be
educated
for
civilization
raoul
looked
across
the
open
pit
at
auguste
the
face
was
flushed
an
even
darker
color
but
still
he
stared
fixedly
down
into
the
grave
to
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
begin
to
move
first
he
had
to
get
back
to
the
château
ahead
of
the
funeral
procession
and
join
his
men
there
slowly
so
as
not
to
attract
attention
raoul
drew
back
from
the
graveside
auguste
feet
felt
heavy
and
confined
in
his
cowhide
boots
as
they
crunched
over
the
short
stubble
he
walked
alone
on
the
newly
cut
track
back
toward
the
great
stone
and
log
house
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
spades
biting
into
the
mound
of
dirt
beside
pierre
grave
and
clods
of
earth
thudding
onto
his
coffin
auguste
led
the
procession
of
mourners
the
others
let
him
walk
apart
to
be
alone
with
his
grief
behind
auguste
he
was
aware
were
nicole
and
frank
and
nancy
hale
and
père
isaac
and
then
a
long
line
of
servants
and
farm
hands
and
village
people
near
the
end
of
the
procession
registre
bosquet
played
a
sprightly
tune
as
was
the
custom
among
the
illinois
french
a
way
of
saying
that
life
goes
on
in
the
rear
was
the
cart
that
had
carried
pierre
coffin
with
elysée
and
guichard
as
auguste
walked
he
brooded
about
père
isaac
calling
him
the
fruit
of
sin
why
did
the
priest
have
to
dishonor
his
mother
and
father
so
in
the
eyes
of
the
sauk
people
he
was
no
bastard
as
he
knew
some
pale
eyes
called
him
still
he
was
glad
that
the
priest
said
pierre
had
done
the
right
thing
in
bringing
him
here
perhaps
people
would
remember
that
when
raoul
tried
to
take
the
estate
away
from
him
as
he
surely
would
auguste
knew
with
a
sinking
feeling
in
his
stomach
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
raoul
would
strike
at
him
he
felt
himself
wishing
for
black
hawk
and
iron
knife
and
the
other
sauk
warriors
even
wolf
paw
to
be
here
to
stand
by
him
and
owl
carver
and
sun
woman
to
advise
him
now
he
wished
he
had
not
agreed
at
his
father
insistence
to
have
no
contact
with
the
band
while
he
was
being
educated
being
cut
off
from
them
had
helped
him
become
more
quickly
a
part
of
the
white
world
but
now
that
pierre
was
gone
he
felt
so
terribly
alone
a
chill
fell
over
him
like
a
cold
downpour
looking
up
he
saw
men
standing
just
outside
the
fence
that
surrounded
the
château
strung
out
in
a
line
along
the
west
side
where
the
gateway
was
he
had
noticed
them
as
he
was
leaving
the
graveyard
but
had
thought
they
must
be
hands
with
field
work
of
some
sort
important
enough
to
keep
them
from
the
funeral
now
he
was
close
enough
to
see
that
they
were
carrying
rifles
auguste
recognized
raoul
himself
standing
squarely
in
the
gateway
how
had
he
gotten
over
there
auguste
had
thought
he
was
with
the
funeral
procession
a
cold
hollow
opened
in
his
stomach
as
he
grasped
what
was
happening
moment
my
father
is
buried
what
a
fool
i
was
to
think
raoul
would
wait
he
heard
people
murmuring
behind
him
oh
my
god
nicole
said
not
now
auguste
it
was
nancy
voice
shrill
with
fear
he
shook
his
head
trying
to
tell
her
that
he
would
not
turn
back
and
kept
on
walking
in
a
moment
thought
auguste
he
might
be
joining
his
father
on
the
trail
of
souls
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
crunching
on
the
dry
grass
it
was
a
comfort
to
know
that
there
were
others
near
him
although
he
knew
no
one
could
really
help
him
he
had
no
idea
what
he
would
do
he
asked
earthmaker
to
show
him
how
to
walk
this
path
with
courage
and
honor
keeping
his
stride
firm
and
steady
auguste
went
around
the
fence
to
approach
the
gate
glancing
up
at
the
maple
tree
under
which
pierre
had
died
as
auguste
got
closer
raoul
threw
open
his
jacket
showing
his
pistol
holstered
on
one
hip
his
huge
knife
the
one
that
had
scarred
auguste
sheathed
on
the
other
his
eyes
were
shadowed
by
his
black
hat
and
the
black
mustache
hid
his
mouth
his
face
was
a
mask
when
they
were
about
ten
feet
apart
raoul
spoke
now
that
my
brother
is
in
the
ground
i
can
speak
plain
to
you
it
over
for
you
here
you
pierre
natural
son
and
this
is
his
burying
day
so
i
kill
you
unless
you
force
me
to
it
i
want
you
off
de
marion
land
right
now
i
want
you
out
of
smith
county
by
sundown
get
back
to
the
woods
where
you
came
from
can
not
know
how
happy
it
would
make
me
to
do
just
that
auguste
stood
with
his
feet
planted
firmly
on
the
stubble
he
did
not
try
to
think
he
would
rely
on
the
spirits
for
help
he
waited
for
the
knowledge
of
what
to
do
to
come
to
him
he
felt
people
coming
to
stand
beside
him
he
heard
the
creaking
of
wagon
wheels
and
the
soft
of
horses
hooves
as
the
cart
carrying
guichard
and
elysée
rolled
past
the
funeral
procession
and
drew
up
alongside
him
he
glanced
at
the
people
standing
beside
him
to
his
right
frank
and
nicole
their
children
behind
them
to
his
left
nancy
hale
and
père
isaac
auguste
went
colder
still
as
he
saw
eli
greenglove
who
had
been
standing
by
the
gate
in
the
fence
around
the
château
walk
across
the
open
space
the
tail
of
his
coonskin
cap
bobbing
greenglove
carried
a
long
kentucky
rifle
auguste
had
heard
many
a
tale
about
deadly
accuracy
the
missourian
took
a
position
to
one
side
between
raoul
and
auguste
wo
even
need
to
be
a
good
shot
to
kill
me
from
that
words
came
suddenly
to
auguste
mind
he
spoke
loudly
so
everyone
could
hear
and
he
felt
good
that
his
voice
was
strong
he
looked
raoul
in
the
eye
as
he
spoke
i
am
proud
to
be
a
son
of
the
sauk
people
but
my
father
told
me
i
was
his
heir
it
is
in
his
will
he
gave
me
this
house
and
all
this
land
you
have
no
right
to
force
me
to
leave
raoul
laughed
and
slapped
the
pistol
and
the
knife
these
give
me
the
right
he
waved
a
hand
at
the
men
standing
in
a
line
along
the
fence
and
them
frank
hopkins
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
raoul
maybe
there
no
law
around
right
here
and
now
to
make
you
honor
pierre
will
but
there
are
courts
in
illinois
there
a
legislature
there
a
governor
raoul
made
a
sound
halfway
between
a
laugh
and
a
grunt
take
your
friend
to
the
governor
john
reynolds
wants
the
indians
out
of
illinois
as
bad
as
anybody
does
he
was
there
with
the
militia
on
rock
river
last
june
hell
go
to
the
president
i
like
to
see
what
an
old
indian
killer
like
andy
jackson
would
say
to
you
all
too
true
auguste
thought
sadly
he
had
learned
in
new
york
of
jackson
removal
policy
aiming
to
drive
all
the
red
people
to
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
the
work
of
the
white
chiefs
was
to
take
land
from
indians
not
help
them
keep
it
père
isaac
said
to
rob
the
orphan
is
a
sin
that
cries
out
to
heaven
for
vengeance
if
you
came
to
me
in
confession
i
could
not
give
you
absolution
my
conscience
is
clear
raoul
said
victoire
is
my
rightful
heritage
do
you
know
that
this
indian
boy
you
feel
so
sorry
for
is
even
a
christian
i
am
father
a
catholic
a
very
bad
one
said
père
isaac
i
have
known
auguste
since
he
was
a
small
boy
he
behaves
more
like
a
christian
than
you
do
a
woman
voice
nancy
hale
rang
out
over
the
field
raoul
de
marion
if
you
wo
listen
to
your
own
priest
you
still
have
to
face
my
father
when
he
hears
what
you
done
he
preach
against
you
and
he
stir
people
to
make
you
do
the
right
thing
raoul
face
changed
he
looked
pained
now
miss
nancy
it
is
proper
for
a
lady
like
you
to
concern
herself
with
what
happens
to
trash
like
this
you
know
well
and
good
that
your
father
may
have
a
low
opinion
of
me
but
he
has
an
even
lower
opinion
of
indians
he
wo
side
with
this
indian
bastard
suddenly
nicole
rushed
past
auguste
you
the
one
who
trash
raoul
she
cried
and
ran
across
the
intervening
space
and
swung
her
hand
to
slap
her
brother
raoul
grabbed
her
arm
and
pushed
her
away
roughly
frank
rushed
to
her
side
to
hold
her
his
fingers
digging
into
her
sleeves
i
would
want
to
fight
with
you
nicole
said
raoul
with
a
cruel
grin
i
believe
you
got
the
weight
advantage
on
me
you
a
murderer
and
a
thief
raoul
she
shot
back
and
the
day
will
come
when
people
will
have
enough
of
you
and
drive
you
out
of
this
county
waves
of
heat
and
cold
ran
through
auguste
body
and
when
he
clenched
his
fists
he
felt
the
sweat
on
his
palms
he
had
to
speak
out
he
owed
it
to
his
father
to
fight
somehow
for
this
land
but
how
could
he
drive
away
some
twenty
armed
men
a
sudden
thought
came
to
him
raoul
i
challenge
you
to
fight
me
for
the
land
with
pistols
or
knives
or
barehanded
any
way
you
want
it
raoul
grinned
white
teeth
appearing
suddenly
under
the
black
mustache
you
gotten
big
in
the
last
six
years
but
i
a
better
shot
than
you
are
and
i
slice
you
to
bits
with
my
knife
in
a
barehanded
fight
bite
your
ears
off
and
ram
down
your
throat
we
do
need
a
fight
to
prove
what
anybody
can
plainly
see
if
you
wo
fight
me
you
a
coward
as
well
as
a
thief
raoul
eyes
narrowed
and
his
shoulders
hunched
forward
as
if
he
was
about
to
attack
dueling
is
also
a
grave
sin
said
père
isaac
and
it
is
against
the
law
of
this
state
i
forbid
you
to
fight
raoul
laughed
and
lifted
his
empty
hands
too
bad
mongrel
the
father
wo
let
us
fight
auguste
turned
to
père
isaac
how
can
you
take
from
me
the
only
way
i
have
of
fighting
for
this
land
if
god
wants
you
to
have
it
he
will
see
that
you
get
it
without
doing
wrong
said
père
isaac
calmly
the
face
of
black
hawk
appeared
in
auguste
mind
and
suddenly
he
understood
the
wrath
that
had
always
seemed
to
smoulder
just
below
the
war
chief
skin
this
must
be
how
black
hawk
felt
when
the
pale
eyes
told
him
he
could
no
longer
come
to
saukenuk
that
was
why
black
hawk
had
been
leading
his
people
back
to
saukenuk
year
after
year
he
would
not
give
up
and
neither
would
auguste
must
fight
i
promised
my
father
i
would
fight
for
this
land
i
smoked
the
calumet
with
he
remembered
pierre
words
you
have
a
chance
to
own
land
to
be
rich
and
to
have
power
you
can
learn
how
to
use
your
wealth
to
protect
your
and
he
was
losing
that
chance
as
he
saw
these
rich
acres
being
torn
away
from
him
more
and
more
he
felt
himself
wanting
them
but
how
to
fight
for
the
land
to
charge
raoul
pistol
and
the
rifles
of
his
men
would
simply
mean
death
surely
that
was
not
what
pierre
wanted
for
him
an
unfamiliar
voice
said
is
this
really
how
you
settle
land
disputes
in
smith
county
auguste
turned
to
see
david
cooper
a
lean
man
he
had
met
several
weeks
earlier
when
cooper
had
visited
pierre
to
pay
his
respects
raoul
said
do
you
like
the
way
we
do
things
here
cooper
cooper
cold
expression
did
not
change
just
requesting
information
de
marion
that
all
cooper
had
brought
his
family
to
victor
from
some
place
in
indiana
three
years
ago
buying
a
choice
piece
of
bottomland
from
pierre
auguste
had
learned
that
he
was
a
veteran
of
the
war
of
justus
bennett
the
county
land
commissioner
who
auguste
knew
to
be
one
of
raoul
creatures
said
cooper
i
been
reading
law
most
of
my
adult
life
and
i
can
assure
you
raoul
de
marion
has
as
sound
a
case
under
common
law
and
english
precedent
as
i
ever
seen
auguste
doubted
that
anyone
here
knew
what
that
meant
impressive
as
it
might
sound
whites
know
how
to
twist
any
law
to
their
cooper
said
nothing
further
these
people
might
feel
sorry
for
him
auguste
thought
and
resent
what
raoul
was
doing
but
he
get
no
help
from
any
of
the
men
who
were
standing
around
behind
him
raoul
and
his
men
were
armed
and
determined
and
the
rest
of
the
people
here
were
not
ready
to
give
up
their
lives
to
help
a
but
auguste
had
taken
advantage
of
raoul
distraction
with
cooper
and
bennett
to
cut
the
distance
between
himself
and
his
uncle
in
half
if
he
could
get
close
enough
to
raoul
he
might
have
a
chance
to
get
at
him
with
his
knife
he
worn
the
knife
today
only
because
his
father
had
given
it
to
him
as
he
hesitated
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
grass
and
turned
to
see
his
grandfather
walking
toward
raoul
with
slow
but
firm
steps
thumping
his
walking
stick
on
the
ground
no
grandpapa
auguste
called
out
to
him
this
is
my
son
i
very
much
regret
to
say
said
elysée
and
i
must
administer
correction
auguste
started
to
follow
elysée
but
raoul
dropped
his
hand
warningly
to
his
pistol
do
come
any
closer
i
was
with
pierre
when
he
wrote
his
final
will
said
elysée
and
i
have
a
copy
of
it
i
know
his
mind
was
sound
he
gave
the
whole
estate
except
for
the
fur
company
which
we
have
always
agreed
would
be
yours
to
auguste
you
gave
the
fur
company
to
me
when
you
divided
the
estate
between
me
and
pierre
years
ago
raoul
said
so
my
own
good
brother
left
me
nothing
thirty
thousand
acres
of
the
best
land
in
western
illinois
go
to
a
mongrel
indian
and
you
say
his
mind
was
sound
the
more
fool
you
you
are
un
bète
elysée
shouted
you
are
proof
that
there
is
no
just
god
if
there
were
he
would
have
taken
you
and
let
pierre
live
monsieur
de
marion
the
priest
cried
think
what
you
are
saying
on
this
day
of
all
days
raoul
said
i
always
known
that
you
loved
pierre
and
not
me
papa

make
it
impossible
to
love
you
elysée
answered
now

home

place

love

buried
here
i
command

at
once
get
off
this
land
raoul
a
head
taller
than
the
old
man
took
a
step
toward
his
father
if
you
wanted
it
to
be
yours
you
should
have
given
it
to
pierre
you
have
nothing
now
you
old
fool
elysée
swung
the
stick
at
raoul
head
the
thump
resounded
over
the
field
and
raoul
staggered
back
his
hat
falling
to
the
ground
raoul
bared
his
teeth
drew
back
his
fist
and
smashed
it
into
his
father
face
the
blow
knocked
elysée
hard
against
one
of
the
upright
logs
of
the
gateway
he
cried
out
and
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
he
lay
moaning
and
jerking
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
agony
the
priest
rushed
to
him
dropping
to
his
knees
with
a
scream
nicole
threw
herself
down
beside
her
father
a
red
curtain
swept
over
auguste
eyes
blinding
him
momentarily
when
he
could
see
again
he
saw
only
the
face
of
one
man
raoul
looking
down
at
elysée
with
triumph
and
contempt
knife
in
hand
auguste
threw
himself
at
raoul
raoul
pistol
was
out
his
dark
eyes
gleamed
with
triumph
as
he
pointed
the
muzzle
at
auguste
chest
was
hoping
i
would
attack
auguste
realized
knowing
he
would
never
reach
raoul
before
the
pistol
went
off
a
sudden
movement
to
his
side
caught
his
eye
in
a
glance
he
saw
eli
greenglove
swinging
a
rifle
butt
at
his
head
dispossessed
auguste
woke
he
was
in
a
room
he
had
never
seen
before
a
plain
black
cross
hung
high
on
one
white
plaster
wall
he
lay
on
a
bed
with
a
mattress
on
top
of
the
quilt
he
was
wearing
his
coat
or
his
pale
boots
pain
throbbed
in
his
head
and
with
each
pulse
his
vision
momentarily
blurred
he
rolled
his
pounding
head
on
the
pillow
and
saw
nancy
hale
sitting
beside
him
her
long
blond
braids
glistened
in
the
pale
light
that
came
through
the
oiled
paper
window
the
way
she
was
looking
down
at
him
startled
him
the
blue
of
her
eyes
burned
like
the
blue
center
of
a
flame
her
lips
seemed
fuller
and
redder
than
he
ever
seen
them
and
they
were
slightly
parted
this
was
the
way
she
had
been
looking
at
him
while
he
lay
unconscious
he
realized
and
he
had
seen
it
only
because
he
had
awakened
suddenly
and
taken
her
by
surprise
what
happened
he
asked
that
man
of
your
uncle
eli
greenglove
hit
you
with
his
rifle
your
uncle
said
he
kill
you
next
time
he
sees
you
awake
so
we
took
you
out
here
to
my
father
parsonage
how
long
have
i
been
asleep
he
said
a
long
time
hours
i
awfully
glad
to
see
you
wake
up
auguste
i
did
know
if
you
ever
would
greenglove
hit
you
hard
enough
to
kill
you
he
remembered
elysée
lying
on
the
ground
writhing
rage
boiled
up
inside
him
again
as
he
thought
of
raoul
striking
grandpapa
down
how
is
my
grandfather
he
tried
to
sit
up
and
the
room
started
to
rock
and
pitch
the
pain
pounded
on
his
head
like
a
spiked
war
club
nancy
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
he
lay
back
against
the
pillow
he
shut
his
eyes
momentarily
to
get
his
equilibrium
back
we
do
know
he
may
have
broken
his
hip
but
try
not
to
worry
auguste
nicole
and
frank
took
him
back
to
their
house
that
searing
gaze
of
a
moment
ago
was
gone
but
there
was
still
a
warm
light
in
her
eyes
he
heard
a
footstep
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
he
turned
bringing
back
the
ache
in
his
head
full
force
to
see
the
tall
figure
of
reverend
philip
hale
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
small
room
hale
dressed
in
a
black
clawhammer
coat
and
black
trousers
with
a
white
silk
stock
wrapped
around
his
throat
stood
with
his
arms
folded
gazing
at
auguste
with
pursed
lips
and
a
deep
crease
between
his
bushy
eyebrows
you
can
thank
the
lord
mercy
you
not
hurt
worse
young
man
i
suppose
you
want
to
be
on
your
way
soon
father
nancy
exclaimed
he
just
came
awake
he
might
have
a
fractured
skull
i
think
i
all
right
auguste
said
he
tried
to
sit
up
again
he
managed
it
but
he
felt
suddenly
dizzy
and
sick
to
his
stomach
he
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
nancy
picked
up
a
china
chamber
pot
from
the
bedside
and
held
it
for
him
but
after
a
moment
the
spasm
of
nausea
passed
and
gingerly
he
shook
his
head
at
her
his
first
afternoon
at
victoire
when
he
had
thrown
up
his
dinner
before
everyone
in
the
great
hall
flickered
through
his
memory
he
looked
up
and
saw
hale
staring
at
him
with
even
deeper
distaste
clear
enough
that
the
reverend
did
like
to
see
nancy
care
for
him
hurt
and
i
the
only
one
around
here
with
medical
auguste
lifted
his
head
again
determined
to
get
up
in
spite
of
the
pain
i
must
go
to
my
grandfather
he
may
die
if
he
is
cared
for
properly
a
spear
of
horror
shot
through
him
his
medicine
bundle
containing
his
precious
stones
and
the
bear
claw
was
still
at
the
château
all
his
spiritual
power
was
collected
in
that
bag
whatever
the
risk
he
must
go
back
and
get
it
and
he
wanted
the
bag
of
surgical
instruments
brought
back
from
new
york
i
be
out
of
here
as
soon
as
i
can
stand
sir
he
said
i
have
much
to
do
no
nancy
cried
auguste
you
not
well
enough
to
go
anywhere
and
father
i
told
you
what
happened
at
the
funeral
we
got
to
help
auguste
if
you
speak
people
will
listen
i
do
know
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
it
said
hale
looking
irritated
presented
with
a
problem
he
did
not
want
to
try
to
solve
auguste
said
my
father
wanted
me
to
inherit
victoire
there
are
witnesses
there
are
two
copies
of
his
will
if
raoul
has
already
destroyed
them
reverend
hale
glowered
at
auguste
what
if
raoul
de
marion
men
come
looking
for
you
suddenly
as
when
facing
raoul
at
the
gateway
to
victoire
auguste
felt
terribly
alone
nancy
would
do
anything
she
could
for
him
after
seeing
her
loving
look
when
he
awoke
he
was
sure
of
that
but
there
was
little
enough
she
could
do
especially
because
of
the
way
her
father
so
obviously
felt
about
him
i
be
gone
as
quick
as
i
can
reverend
hale
if
they
come
here
while
auguste
is
here
you
have
to
tell
them
not
here
and
refuse
to
let
them
in
said
nancy
firmly
lie
to
them
i
not
a
jesuit
father
would
you
let
auguste
be
killed
the
word
killed
set
a
storm
of
frightful
thoughts
whirling
through
auguste
head
raoul
pistol
had
been
pointed
right
at
his
chest
and
greenglove
had
tried
to
brain
him
they
would
stop
until
they
had
killed
him
only
then
would
raoul
be
secure
in
his
possession
of
victoire
dazed
and
hurting
though
he
was
auguste
had
to
get
out
of
smith
county
if
he
was
to
live
another
day
hale
turned
and
went
back
to
his
own
room
shaking
his
head
your
father
is
no
friend
to
me
said
auguste
nancy
face
was
like
a
lake
whose
surface
was
troubled
by
a
wind
very
strict
he
did
go
to
your
father
funeral
because
it
was
a
catholic
service
but
if
anything
happens
he
do
the
right
thing
you
can
count
on
him
for
that
auguste
said
nothing
but
he
did
share
her
confidence
early
that
evening
auguste
nancy
and
reverend
hale
were
sitting
in
the
front
room
of
the
hales
house
they
had
eaten
a
rabbit
stew
with
potatoes
onions
and
beans
from
the
hales
garden
and
hominy
grits
on
the
side
that
nancy
had
pounded
from
corn
they
washed
it
down
with
apple
cider
i
allow
no
spiritous
liquors
in
my
home
said
reverend
hale
now
that
it
was
dark
auguste
wanted
desperately
to
be
off
to
see
grandpapa
at
nicole
and
frank
house
the
old
man
had
been
badly
hurt
he
might
be
dying
by
candlelight
hale
read
the
bible
aloud
to
nancy
and
auguste
it
was
his
nightly
custom
nancy
explained
auguste
heard
the
soft
of
a
horse
hooves
and
the
creak
of
carriage
wheels
and
raised
a
hand
to
alert
the
others
putting
a
finger
to
her
lips
nancy
went
to
the
door
she
opened
it
a
crack
then
pulled
it
wider
and
went
out
who
is
it
hale
called
anxiously
his
heart
pounding
auguste
was
on
his
feet
looking
for
a
weapon
or
for
a
place
to
hide
no
answer
came
from
nancy
but
a
moment
later
she
came
back
one
arm
around
another
woman
shoulders
supporting
her
a
blue
kerchief
covered
the
woman
head
who
is
this
hale
said
again
bon
soir
reverend
hale
forgive
me
for
disturbing
you
it
was
a
moment
before
auguste
recognized
the
battered
swollen
face
of
marchette
one
of
her
eyes
had
been
blackened
this
morning
but
now
there
were
ugly
bruises
around
both
eyes
her
whole
face
was
swollen
and
her
lips
were
cut
and
puffed
heartbroken
at
the
sight
of
her
auguste
rushed
to
the
cook
and
took
her
hands
in
his
marchette
what
happened
to
you
i
cried
very
much
when
you
and
monsieur
elysée
were
hurt
today
monsieur
auguste
armand
did
not
like
this
and
he
beat
me
it
very
bad
but
he
did
not
beat
me
hard
monsieur
whoever
armand
beats
hard
dies
but
i
resolved
to
do
something
for
you
monsieur
raoul
he
had
barrels
of
kaintuck
whiskey
carted
up
to
the
château
many
guests
and
servants
got
very
drunk
after
a
while
armand
was
lying
on
the
floor
beside
the
table
so
then
i
went
to
fetch
your
things
your
trunk
was
unlocked
and
i
gathered
up
your
clothes
and
books
and
put
them
in
it
and
locked
it
i
had
bernadette
bosquet
the
fiddler
wife
she
is
my
friend
help
carry
your
trunk
down
to
the
carriage
auguste
felt
as
if
a
sudden
bright
light
had
flooded
his
room
his
medicine
bundle
had
been
in
the
trunk
and
his
surgical
instruments
they
were
safe
he
jumped
up
from
the
table
a
throb
of
pain
went
through
his
head
and
he
felt
dizzy
and
had
to
cling
to
the
table
for
support
eyes
widened
in
alarm
and
she
put
her
hands
out
to
him
recovered
after
a
moment
and
feeling
much
better
now
than
he
had
a
few
hours
ago
he
took
marchette
hands
in
his
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
this
means
to
me
marchette
there
were
things
in
my
trunk
sacred
things
very
important
to
me
very
precious
i
thank
you
a
thousand
times
her
swollen
lips
parted
in
a
half
smile
she
reached
into
a
pocket
in
her
apron
and
brought
out
a
large
pocket
watch
gleaming
a
dull
gold
then
she
took
out
a
familiar
oval
silver
case
with
a
velvet
ribbon
these
were
your
father
monsieur
i
believe
he
would
wish
that
you
have
them
auguste
opened
the
case
and
saw
the
round
lenses
for
only
a
moment
as
his
eyes
blurred
he
put
his
hand
over
his
face
and
held
it
there
until
he
no
longer
felt
like
weeping
then
he
looked
at
the
engraving
on
the
watch
pierre
louis
auguste
de
marion
and
his
eyes
filled
up
with
tears
this
he
thought
should
go
into
his
medicine
bundle
with
the
other
sacred
objects
where
were
raoul
and
greenglove
when
you
took
my
trunk
and
things
in
the
carriage
before
armand
got
drunk
monsieur
raoul
made
him
look
through
monsieur
elysée
room
for
the
paper
that
says
you
are
to
inherit
the
estate
armand
found
it
and
gave
it
to
your
uncle
and
he
threw
it
into
the
fire
while
armand
and
eli
greenglove
watched
and
laughed
then
monsieur
raoul
he
got
into
a
most
furious
argument
with
eli
greenglove
about
greenglove
daughter
they
nearly
fight
but
i
think
they
are
afraid
of
each
other
they
are
both
great
killers
so
finally
they
went
down
to
town
monsieur
raoul
agreed
to
bring
his
woman
greenglove
daughter
and
the
two
boys
to
the
château
disgraceful
snorted
reverend
hale
publicly
living
in
sin
i
wonder
why
he
did
bring
them
to
the
funeral
nancy
said
auguste
thought
he
knew
why
clarissa
greenglove
had
been
a
pretty
girl
when
he
first
arrived
at
victoire
but
in
the
years
during
which
she
had
borne
two
boys
to
raoul
she
had
turned
into
a
slattern
years
ago
raoul
had
said
he
was
going
to
marry
clarissa
but
he
never
had
and
auguste
had
seen
raoul
bending
a
hungry
look
on
nancy
throughout
the
funeral
mass
this
morning
the
thought
of
raoul
laying
even
a
hand
on
nancy
angered
him
it
would
anger
eli
greenglove
too
for
a
different
reason
eli
greenglove
it
was
said
could
shoot
the
wings
off
a
fly
one
at
a
time
at
fifty
yards
and
was
wanted
in
missouri
for
over
a
dozen
murders
he
might
take
orders
from
raoul
but
it
would
not
do
for
raoul
to
offend
such
a
man
so
if
eli
persisted
raoul
probably
would
take
clarissa
into
the
château
auguste
felt
a
sinking
in
his
stomach
as
he
touched
his
fingers
lightly
to
his
throbbing
head
he
was
alive
now
only
because
greenglove
had
chosen
to
hit
him
instead
of
shooting
him
down
or
instead
of
letting
raoul
have
that
pleasure
will
you
stay
the
night
marchette
nancy
asked
no
i
must
go
back
to
the
château
before
armand
wakes
up
otherwise
he
will
beat
me
worse
i
going
with
you
said
auguste
no
said
nancy
they
kill
you
auguste
looked
across
the
table
at
nancy
staring
at
him
with
round
blue
eyes
full
of
the
yearning
now
mixed
with
fear
that
he
seen
in
them
earlier
pale
eyes
the
sauk
term
for
her
people
did
no
justice
to
her
eyes
the
color
of
the
turquoise
stone
he
kept
in
his
medicine
bag
her
blond
hair
made
his
blood
race
his
fingertips
tingled
with
the
desire
to
touch
the
white
skin
of
her
cheek
though
nancy
very
differentness
made
him
desire
her
he
knew
that
he
and
she
could
never
belong
to
each
other
as
completely
as
he
and
redbird
did
he
could
have
a
deep
and
lasting
union
with
redbird
a
union
that
would
make
him
feel
whole
but
it
had
been
six
years
since
he
had
seen
redbird
and
no
woman
of
the
sauk
would
go
without
a
man
for
that
long
mother
he
reminded
himself
but
redbird
had
probably
given
in
to
wolf
paw
and
married
him
after
all
she
had
had
a
word
from
white
bear
in
all
that
time
marchette
urgent
tone
refocused
his
thoughts
monsieur
raoul
he
stood
up
on
the
table
and
held
up
a
bag
full
of
spanish
dollars
he
said
there
were
fifty
and
said
he
would
give
it
to
the
man
who
shoots
you
and
there
were
many
men
who
cheered
at
that
and
boasted
they
would
be
the
one
to
win
the
silver
auguste
pictured
men
scattering
out
all
over
smith
county
hunting
for
him
he
could
almost
feel
the
rifle
ball
shattering
his
skull
i
ca
hide
in
your
house
forever
nancy
sooner
or
later
they
come
looking
for
me
and
i
do
want
to
bring
that
down
on
your
heads
reverend
hale
said
nothing
but
auguste
saw
relief
in
his
square
face
and
grudging
respect
but
hale
respect
he
thought
would
do
him
little
good
when
he
lay
dead
on
the
prairie
nancy
full
lips
quivered
as
she
said
you
go
to
the
château
and
let
them
shoot
you
auguste
realized
that
his
hands
were
cold
with
fear
and
he
rubbed
them
together
to
warm
them
hale
house
was
about
ten
miles
across
the
prairie
from
the
mississippi
could
he
cover
all
that
distance
without
being
seen
and
shot
i
not
going
to
the
château
i
just
see
that
marchette
gets
there
safely
traveling
at
night
she
should
have
someone
go
back
with
her
then
i
go
on
to
town
to
nicole
and
frank
house
to
grandpapa
i
must
see
him
he
turned
toward
the
cook
and
felt
a
stabbing
in
his
gut
at
the
sight
of
her
bruised
face
she
suffered
that
out
of
love
for
his
father
he
thought
and
for
his
sake
too
if
you
seen
you
be
shot
said
hale
you
think
i
know
that
he
wanted
to
scream
at
the
minister
what
choice
did
he
have
he
was
like
a
rabbit
surrounded
by
wolves
he
forced
calm
on
himself
and
spoke
with
sarcasm
surely
you
know
reverend
that
indians
are
good
at
getting
about
unnoticed
he
felt
his
fear
turning
to
a
rising
excitement
as
he
recalled
the
lessons
of
stealth
and
cunning
he
learned
as
a
child
of
the
sauk
but
what
will
you
do
then
nancy
asked
how
will
you
get
back
here
auguste
hesitated
remembering
that
he
was
a
sauk
had
moved
his
thoughts
in
a
new
direction
have
been
dispossessed
just
as
my
people
have
been
nancy
was
waiting
for
him
to
speak
raoul
told
me
to
go
back
to
the
woods
with
the
other
indians
even
though
the
advice
came
from
him
i
think
that
is
just
what
i
should
do
nancy
gasped
as
if
he
had
struck
her
there
was
silence
in
the
cottage
for
a
moment
how
will
you
get
back
to
your
people
she
said
how
will
you
find
them
he
smiled
trying
to
get
her
to
smile
back
at
him
i
know
exactly
where
they
are
they
crossed
the
mississippi
to
their
hunting
grounds
in
the
ioway
territory
i
spent
the
first
fifteen
winters
of
my
life
there
with
the
british
band
auguste
remembered
his
dream
of
becoming
a
shaman
it
had
come
back
to
life
a
bit
with
his
effort
to
heal
pierre
among
the
pale
eyes
there
was
no
room
for
magic
but
now
he
felt
he
could
go
back
to
his
own
people
and
find
magic
again
hale
said
an
unwise
decision
it
seems
to
me
you
been
educated
you
had
an
opportunity
to
learn
about
white
christian
civilization
your
uncle
ca
take
that
away
from
you
and
you
should
not
throw
it
away
auguste
said
reverend
you
know
what
i
leaving
behind
but
you
know
what
i
going
back
to
nancy
started
speaking
rapidly
as
if
she
was
trying
to
hold
back
tears
well
what
about
these
things
of
yours
that
marchette
brought
here
there
no
way
you
can
carry
a
trunk
on
foot
even
as
far
as
nicole
and
frank
house
would
you
like
us
to
keep
your
things
here
for
you
perhaps
someday
after
you
settled
with
your
tribe
she
swallowed
hard
you
could
send
for
them
auguste
heard
the
anguish
in
her
voice
but
decided
to
take
her
words
at
only
face
value
yes
i
be
truly
grateful
if
you
keep
them
for
me
the
only
thing
i
want
to
take
now
is
my
medicine
bundle
reverend
hale
pursed
his
lips
and
snorted
but
auguste
ignored
him
auguste
thought
a
moment
and
i
can
use
the
surgical
instruments
and
at
least
one
book
let
it
be
a
bible
said
hale
auguste
made
no
answer
to
that
as
eli
greenglove
struck
him
down
auguste
remembered
he
had
been
charging
at
raoul
with
his
knife
in
his
hand
what
happened
to
my
knife
i
picked
it
up
said
nancy
in
a
clipped
tone
she
stood
up
and
went
over
to
an
elaborately
carved
oak
sideboard
a
handsome
piece
of
furniture
that
seemed
out
of
place
in
this
simple
cabin
and
took
auguste
knife
out
of
a
drawer
she
handed
it
to
him
and
he
slipped
it
into
the
leather
sheath
at
his
belt
thank
you
nancy
my
father
gave
that
to
me
a
long
time
ago
their
eyes
met
and
he
felt
a
warmth
spread
through
him
it
was
going
to
be
hard
to
leave
her
nancy
remained
standing
let
go
out
to
the
wagon
and
see
what
marchette
has
brought
i
can
help
you
carry
your
trunk
in
marchette
and
reverend
hale
both
said
at
the
same
time
i
can
do
that
the
coincidence
made
everyone
laugh
nervously
no
said
nancy
firmly
marchette
you
hurt
and
tired
father
why
do
you
see
what
consolation
you
can
offer
this
poor
mistreated
woman
auguste
trunk
ca
be
that
heavy
come
on
auguste
before
either
hale
or
marchette
could
answer
nancy
had
auguste
out
the
door
he
glanced
back
into
the
room
just
before
the
door
closed
and
saw
hale
fists
clenched
on
either
side
of
his
open
bible
auguste
stood
for
a
moment
letting
his
eyes
adjust
from
the
lamplight
inside
to
the
darkness
out
here
a
fat
moon
hung
overhead
he
judged
it
would
be
full
in
two
nights
with
this
much
light
he
be
in
even
more
danger
tonight
the
steeple
of
reverend
hale
little
church
next
to
the
cottage
where
he
and
nancy
lived
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
beside
him
in
the
dark
nancy
whispered
fiercely
i
do
you
to
go
sadly
he
said
i
know
he
took
her
hand
and
squeezed
it
perhaps
it
was
a
mistake
to
do
that
but
he
could
not
stop
himself
come
away
from
the
house
she
said
now
he
could
see
the
wagon
marchette
had
come
in
the
horse
tied
to
a
fence
post
beside
the
hales
garden
on
the
south
side
of
the
house
the
horse
shifted
from
foot
to
foot
and
burbled
its
breath
out
through
its
lips
holding
tight
to
his
hand
nancy
led
him
around
to
the
rear
of
the
house
beyond
which
rows
of
corn
stood
their
tassels
silvery
in
the
moonlight
you
and
your
father
grow
all
this
corn
auguste
asked
it
our
land
but
a
neighbor
does
the
work
he
sells
it
in
victor
and
we
share
the
proceeds
she
led
him
into
the
corn
brushing
past
the
crackling
leaves
the
concealment
of
the
leaves
and
stalks
made
him
feel
closer
to
her
than
ever
he
wanted
to
reach
out
to
her
but
the
corn
evoked
another
feeling
as
well
ca
know
it
but
this
field
reminds
me
of
the
corn
bottoms
around
saukenuk
it
makes
me
want
to
go
back
all
the
when
there
were
leafy
stalks
all
around
them
hiding
them
from
the
house
she
turned
to
him
again
and
said
please
auguste
i
do
want
you
to
go
away
for
good
her
eyes
were
bright
in
the
moonlight
her
nearness
was
thrilling
he
wanted
to
forget
the
worries
that
made
him
hesitate
and
take
her
in
his
arms
you
do
want
me
to
stay
here
and
risk
getting
killed
he
said
you
could
go
to
vandalia
she
said
tell
governor
reynolds
what
happened
if
he
ca
do
anything
for
you
himself
maybe
he
can
help
you
find
a
lawyer
who
will
fight
raoul
for
you
in
the
courts
how
innocent
she
was
he
thought
bitterly
it
was
governor
reynolds
who
called
out
the
militia
to
drive
my
people
from
saukenuk
it
just
as
raoul
said
he
would
be
the
last
man
to
want
to
help
an
indian
fight
for
land
with
a
white
man
your
father
sent
you
to
school
in
the
east
because
he
wanted
a
different
future
for
you
than
just
spending
your
life
hunting
and
living
in
a
wigwam
you
be
throwing
all
that
away
he
felt
a
flash
of
anger
at
her
she
did
not
understand
the
sauk
way
of
life
at
all
she
was
just
repeating
what
her
father
had
said
he
remembered
the
way
nancy
eyes
had
shone
each
time
they
met
on
the
prairie
last
summer
he
had
known
then
that
if
he
spoke
to
nancy
of
marriage
she
would
want
it
no
matter
how
much
it
enraged
her
father
but
marriage
with
nancy
would
be
a
coming
together
of
two
strangers
of
people
whose
worlds
were
utterly
different
in
the
past
six
years
he
had
learned
much
about
her
world
but
that
did
not
mean
he
belonged
in
it
and
she
knew
next
to
nothing
of
his
it
hurt
to
hold
himself
back
he
felt
powerfully
drawn
to
her
but
what
he
was
feeling
was
impossible
impossible
to
fulfill
i
can
use
my
schooling
to
help
my
people
make
a
better
life
for
themselves
the
gift
my
father
gave
me
is
a
gift
i
will
give
to
the
sauk
and
it
may
be
worth
more
than
the
land
raoul
has
stolen
from
me
i
do
want
to
lose
you
she
sobbed
she
threw
herself
against
him
and
wrapped
her
arms
around
him
her
cheek
pressed
against
his
her
face
was
hot
as
though
she
had
a
fever
she
wanted
him
he
felt
it
now
just
as
he
had
seen
it
hours
ago
in
her
unguarded
eyes
i
never
cared
for
a
man
as
i
care
for
you
auguste
she
said
everything
you
say
may
be
true
but
if
you
go
back
to
your
tribe
never
see
you
again
it
hurt
auguste
to
admit
it
but
it
was
almost
certain
that
they
would
never
meet
again
if
you
want
to
you
could
come
with
me
even
as
he
spoke
he
was
sure
it
would
never
work
did
she
not
dismiss
the
way
of
the
sauk
as
hunting
and
living
in
a
wigwam
and
suppose
redbird
waited
for
him
what
would
he
do
with
nancy
then
no
she
said
if
i
went
with
you
my
father
would
hunt
us
down
and
raoul
would
help
him
and
besides
she
hesitated
what
else
she
shook
her
head
i
too
afraid
indians
frighten
me
not
you
real
indians
indians
anger
pulsed
in
his
head
he
wanted
to
pull
away
from
her
then
but
she
would
let
him
go
her
arms
tightened
around
him
and
her
body
moved
against
him
auguste
do
you
know
where
it
says
in
the
bible
knew
eve
his
wife
i
want
to
know
you
that
way
her
soft
words
thrilled
him
and
he
forgot
his
anger
he
felt
exalted
and
he
held
her
tightly
he
had
wanted
nancy
ever
since
he
met
her
last
june
all
summer
long
desiring
her
he
had
fought
his
desire
he
pressed
his
mouth
on
hers
crushing
her
soft
full
lips
she
was
pulling
at
him
now
pulling
him
down
pulling
him
to
lie
with
her
between
the
rows
of
corn
must
not
do
abruptly
he
steadied
his
feet
and
drew
his
face
away
from
hers
the
vague
shape
of
a
future
different
from
the
one
he
planned
shimmered
in
his
mind
they
could
have
each
other
here
and
now
and
he
could
give
up
his
decision
to
return
to
the
sauk
he
might
flee
temporarily
to
some
nearby
county
find
work
study
until
he
could
begin
practicing
medicine
marry
nancy
perhaps
even
try
to
win
back
the
estate
in
the
pale
eyes
courts
he
would
become
more
or
less
a
pale
eyes
it
would
be
the
end
of
him
as
a
sauk
and
the
white
bear
arose
in
his
mind
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
suddenly
stood
up
here
among
the
corn
stalks
the
white
bear
said
people
need
auguste
please
nancy
whispered
it
is
wrong
right
for
us
there
no
other
man
but
you
who
right
for
me
i
want
to
end
up
a
old
spinster
who
never
knew
the
man
she
truly
loved
she
slid
down
the
length
of
him
falling
to
her
knees
in
the
furrow
she
pressed
her
cheek
against
the
hard
bulge
in
his
trousers
sending
a
thrill
through
his
whole
body
please
he
wanted
to
let
himself
sink
to
the
ground
with
her
he
shut
his
eyes
and
saw
the
white
bear
more
vividly
in
his
mind
it
seemed
to
glow
he
held
himself
rigid
fighting
the
pressure
inside
him
that
made
him
want
to
give
in
to
her
he
told
himself
he
could
give
nancy
this
moment
of
love
she
wanted
and
still
go
back
to
the
sauk
if
he
did
not
take
her
now
as
she
wanted
to
be
taken
he
would
regret
it
bitterly
later
but
if
he
did
this
with
her
it
would
tie
them
in
a
bond
that
would
be
wrong
to
break
if
he
gave
her
what
she
wanted
and
then
left
it
would
hurt
her
might
even
kill
her
he
took
a
step
backward
then
another
his
legs
felt
as
if
they
were
made
of
wood
he
could
barely
move
them
nancy
let
him
go
put
her
hands
to
her
face
and
sobbed
kneeling
between
the
rows
of
corn
he
stood
there
a
moment
feeling
helpless
then
he
went
to
her
took
her
arms
and
helped
her
to
stand
up
i
do
love
you
nancy
he
said
but
if
i
knew
you
as
adam
knew
eve
i
would
still
have
to
leave
you
and
it
would
hurt
both
of
us
much
more
sobs
still
shook
her
body
he
did
not
even
know
if
she
heard
him
but
she
let
him
lead
her
out
of
the
cornfield
around
the
locked
and
silent
church
and
back
to
the
wagon
where
his
trunk
lay
as
they
walked
she
pulled
a
handkerchief
out
of
her
sleeve
wiped
her
face
and
blew
her
nose
his
heart
felt
heavy
as
lead
sure
as
he
was
that
this
was
the
right
thing
to
do
he
was
almost
as
sure
it
was
wrong
when
they
got
to
the
wagon
he
was
still
holding
her
arm
gently
she
pulled
free
of
him
you
a
good
man
auguste
i
afraid
i
always
love
you
whether
you
want
me
to
or
not
are
you
all
right
he
asked
he
wanted
to
make
her
happy
and
he
felt
terribly
helpless
i
will
be
she
said
as
he
rode
in
the
wagon
back
to
the
château
with
marchette
the
back
of
auguste
neck
tingled
he
pictured
silent
hunters
crouched
out
in
the
prairie
their
kentucky
long
rifles
ready
their
thoughts
fixed
on
fifty
pieces
of
silver
his
eyes
moved
restlessly
over
the
low
hills
around
them
the
nearly
full
moon
was
sinking
before
them
in
the
west
a
lantern
at
the
end
of
their
trail
in
some
places
the
prairie
grass
closed
in
around
the
horse
and
wagon
high
as
the
horse
rump
and
the
wagon
wheels
and
it
looked
to
auguste
as
if
they
were
pushing
their
way
through
a
moonlit
lake
the
loudest
sound
he
heard
was
the
steady
singing
of
choruses
of
crickets
more
numerous
than
all
the
tribes
of
man
somehow
it
seemed
they
always
sang
louder
this
time
of
year
as
if
they
knew
that
frost
and
snow
were
coming
soon
to
silence
their
song
the
château
peaked
roof
rose
black
against
the
stars
before
they
reached
the
orchards
auguste
put
his
arm
around
marchette
and
gave
her
a
kiss
on
the
cheek
jumping
down
from
the
wagon
he
tied
to
his
shoulders
with
rawhide
thongs
the
pack
that
held
his
medicine
bundle
his
instruments
and
his
book
and
thank
you
marchette
he
whispered
and
darted
off
into
the
tall
grass
god
keep
his
eye
upon
you
she
called
softly
after
him
watching
for
raoul
lurking
hunters
he
was
soon
past
the
château
and
slipping
along
the
edge
of
the
road
that
led
through
the
hills
to
town
he
froze
he
saw
a
light
ahead
of
him
a
swinging
lantern
moving
away
from
him
loud
voices
carried
to
him
on
the
still
night
air
those
must
be
some
of
raoul
men
he
was
frightened
but
he
needed
to
know
what
raoul
was
doing
staying
well
in
the
shadows
of
the
trees
that
grew
along
the
edge
of
the
road
he
moved
quickly
and
silently
until
he
was
close
enough
to
make
out
words
they
staggered
along
praising
raoul
generosity
with
old
kaintuck
auguste
saw
three
of
them
in
the
lantern
yellow
glow
each
carrying
a
rifle
he
bit
his
lower
lip
and
fear
formed
a
cold
hollow
in
his
chest
if
these
men
saw
him
they
would
shoot
him
on
the
spot
or
try
to
he
doubted
they
could
hit
anything
drunk
as
they
looked
with
that
thought
his
tense
muscles
eased
a
little
the
men
crossed
a
narrow
ridge
that
connected
a
hill
with
the
bluff
on
which
the
trading
post
stood
auguste
flinched
startled
by
a
whoop
and
a
wail
followed
by
the
crash
of
a
body
falling
through
shrubbery
and
a
heavy
clattering
probably
a
rifle
against
rocks
from
the
ridge
came
a
burst
of
drunken
laughter
two
of
the
men
mocked
their
comrade
who
had
rolled
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
they
help
him
climb
back
up
sleep
it
off
down
there
they
told
him
curses
floated
faintly
from
below
then
there
was
silence
what
if
that
indian
is
lurking
around
here
said
the
man
carrying
the
lantern
he
might
come
upon
hodge
in
the
dark
and
scalp
him
or
something
auguste
thought
i
would
love
he
recognized
the
prussian
accent
of
the
man
speaking
it
was
otto
wegner
one
of
the
men
who
worked
at
raoul
trading
post
the
other
man
said
hell

waterloo
hah

hell
of
a
fella
raoul
skin

and
wear
you
for
a
hat
if
he
heard
you
talking
like
that
he
would
not
i
am
his
best
rifleman
after
eli
greenglove
he
knows
my
value
and
my
honor
as
a
soldier
is
worth
more
to
me
than
fifty
pieces
of
eight
crouching
in
the
shrubbery
auguste
shook
his
head
in
wonder
there
was
some
sense
of
right
and
wrong
even
among
raoul
rogues
but
that
had
stopped
wegner
from
being
one
of
the
men
who
backed
raoul
with
his
rifle
this
morning
he
waited
for
the
men
to
cross
the
ridge
he
heard
no
sound
from
the
one
who
had
fallen
he
had
probably
taken
his
comrades
advice
and
gone
to
sleep
when
the
lantern
swung
out
of
sight
around
a
corner
of
the
trading
post
palisade
auguste
darted
forward
keeping
low
he
made
a
wide
circle
through
the
wooded
slope
above
victor
he
scrambled
down
to
the
road
where
the
hopkins
house
stood
a
black
dog
barked
and
ran
at
him
when
he
passed
one
of
the
houses
along
the
road
his
heart
stopped
as
he
waited
for
doors
to
fly
open
and
rifles
to
fire
at
him
but
he
kept
walking
and
the
dog
stopped
barking
when
he
was
beyond
the
house
it
was
guarding
hoping
none
of
the
neighbors
would
hear
him
he
knocked
loudly
at
the
hopkins
door
to
wake
them
up
frank
hopkins
holding
a
candle
in
his
hand
stood
in
the
doorway
in
a
long
nightshirt
what
the
devil
is
it
we
got
a
sick
man
in
here
he
peered
closer
my
god
auguste
get
inside
quick
he
reached
out
dragged
auguste
through
the
door
and
shut
it
quickly
behind
him
i
thought
you
were
out
at
the
hales
they
stood
in
workshop
the
iron
printing
press
towered
shadowy
in
the
candle
glow
i
came
to
see
grandpapa
and
frank
i
going
back
to
my
people
i
need
your
help
come
upstairs
frank
helped
auguste
untie
his
backpack
the
stairs
led
to
a
corridor
and
frank
drew
auguste
into
a
room
where
an
oil
lamp
with
a
tall
glass
chimney
burned
next
to
a
large
bed
nicole
sat
there
the
lamplight
revealed
elysée
sharp
profile
against
the
white
of
the
pillow
nicole
jumped
to
her
feet
oh
auguste
are
you
all
right
i
getting
better
how
is
grandpapa
he
only
been
awake
half
the
time
gram
medill
looked
in
on
him
she
said
he
wrenched
his
hip
when
he
fell
and
had
bad
bruises
but
he
broken
any
bones
i
been
sitting
up
with
him
what
about
you
how
is
your
head
auguste
felt
as
if
chains
had
fallen
away
from
his
chest
at
the
news
that
grandpapa
was
not
dying
then
his
head
started
to
hurt
in
the
excitement
of
slipping
past
his
enemies
auguste
had
forgotten
his
pain
now
he
rubbed
the
spot
above
his
right
ear
where
greenglove
rifle
had
hit
him
he
felt
a
lump
that
was
sore
to
the
touch
but
he
was
able
to
smile
reassuringly
at
nicole
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
so
as
not
to
disturb
elysée
i
wo
be
able
to
put
my
fine
beaver
hat
on
over
this
bump
but
i
wo
be
taking
my
fine
beaver
hat
where
i
going
i
get
some
more
chairs
frank
said
we
can
talk
in
here
the
old
gentleman
is
sound
asleep
now
could
you
use
a
drop
of
brandy
auguste
auguste
nodded
that
might
ease
the
pain
he
thought
not
only
of
the
pain
from
the
rifle
blow
but
of
the
pain
in
his
heart
from
having
lost
victoire
despite
his
promise
to
his
father
and
the
pain
of
tearing
himself
away
from
nancy
he
and
frank
quietly
removed
chairs
from
the
other
upstairs
rooms
where
the
hopkins
children
were
sleeping
frank
went
down
to
the
kitchen
and
came
back
with
a
tray
bearing
three
small
crystal
glasses
and
a
decanter
that
twinkled
in
the
lamplight
handsome
glassware
auguste
said
seating
himself
and
carefully
setting
his
backpack
between
his
feet
from
the
time
of
louis
the
fifteenth
nicole
said
one
of
the
things
papa
brought
over
from
the
old
château
in
france
and
he
gave
it
to
frank
and
me
as
a
wedding
present
at
least
raoul
wo
get
his
hands
on
this
auguste
said
but
raoul
has
everything
else
because
father
left
it
all
to
me
i
told
him
he
should
will
it
to
you
i
should
have
insisted
his
face
burned
with
shame
frank
said
i
doubt
we
have
held
onto
the
estate
any
longer
than
you
did
and
frankly
i
do
want
it
any
more
than
you
do
i
do
know
how
nicole
feels
now
that
the
land
was
irrevocably
lost
to
him
auguste
was
no
longer
so
sure
that
he
did
not
want
it
he
twisted
in
his
chair
angry
at
himself
for
his
uncertainty
nicole
shook
her
head
i
a
wife
and
mother
i
not
prepared
to
be
a
châtelaine
especially
when
i
have
to
fight
that
that
beast
as
frank
poured
an
inch
of
the
warm
amber
liquid
into
each
of
their
glasses
auguste
noticed
that
his
fingers
were
as
always
blackened
he
must
never
get
the
stains
of
his
trade
off
his
hands
frank
said
i
going
to
write
in
the
about
what
happened
today
tell
what
i
saw
so
the
whole
county
will
know
what
happened
auguste
looked
at
nicole
he
saw
fear
in
her
eyes
but
she
said
nothing
why
write
about
it
auguste
said
raoul
would
do
some
harm
to
you
and
it
would
change
nothing
i
wo
even
be
here
to
read
it
the
last
thing
he
wanted
was
these
people
whom
he
cared
about
getting
into
trouble
because
of
him
frank
smiled
faintly
you
know
that
unlike
just
about
every
other
man
in
smith
county
i
do
carry
a
gun
he
pointed
downward
in
the
direction
of
the
press
on
the
floor
below
them
that
my
way
of
fighting
for
a
moment
auguste
felt
ashamed
that
he
was
running
away
from
that
same
fight
because
you
stood
by
me
today
my
heart
will
always
sing
your
praises
do
you
think
my
father
spirit
will
be
sad
if
i
do
not
stay
and
fight
for
the
land
until
i
die
you
almost
did
die
auguste
nicole
said
i
might
yet
before
i
get
away
from
he
sipped
the
brandy
it
burned
his
tongue
and
his
throat
and
lit
a
fire
in
his
belly
it
made
him
feel
stronger
frank
said
nobody
saying
you
should
stay
i
do
want
to
see
you
killed
nicole
said
neither
would
your
father
pierre
wanted
you
to
have
the
estate
but
he
did
want
you
dead
on
account
of
it
amen
to
that
said
frank
auguste
thought
despising
himself
i
think
he
expected
me
to
keep
the
land
for
more
than
a
frank
went
on
but
if
you
go
back
to
your
people
you
got
to
tell
them
they
can
no
more
fight
the
united
states
for
their
land
than
you
could
fight
raoul
a
fierce
heat
rose
in
auguste
as
he
took
another
sip
of
brandy
at
george
school
i
read
that
the
indian
does
not
make
good
use
of
the
land
the
whites
need
the
land
therefore
the
indian
must
yield
he
clenched
his
fist
around
the
glass
in
his
hand
we
were
living
on
this
land
does
that
mean
anything
frank
said
auguste
you
know
better
than
any
of
your
people
how
much
power
the
united
states
have
you
got
to
tell
them
auguste
was
silent
for
a
moment
long
he
thought
that
was
what
his
people
called
the
american
soldiers
but
the
british
band
had
no
idea
how
very
many
long
knives
there
were
he
must
make
black
hawk
understand
he
sipped
a
little
more
of
the
brandy
and
its
fire
flowed
through
his
blood
he
sighed
and
nodded
i
will
tell
them
frank
i
need
a
boat
nicole
said
your
eyelids
are
drooping
auguste
you
tired
and
you
still
hurt
you
ca
go
tonight
true
and
he
wanted
to
stay
long
enough
to
see
grandpapa
when
he
was
awake
auguste
last
memory
that
night
was
of
letting
frank
lead
him
across
the
corridor
into
a
darkened
bedroom
where
he
fell
face
down
on
an
empty
bed
when
he
came
to
himself
again
he
was
lying
on
the
same
bed
still
fully
clothed
except
for
his
boots
the
room
was
not
as
dark
as
he
remembered
it
was
in
a
sort
of
twilight
the
one
window
was
shuttered
a
curtain
covered
the
doorway
he
looked
around
the
room
saw
boys
clothing
hanging
on
pegs
and
piled
on
the
floor
another
bed
covered
with
rumpled
sheets
empty
his
own
boots
and
his
pack
were
set
neatly
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
an
urgent
pressure
inside
told
him
he
had
been
sleeping
a
long
time
he
saw
a
chamber
pot
in
one
corner
smart
of
them
to
leave
the
pot
here
he
thought
as
he
filled
it
he
did
dare
to
go
to
their
outhouse
during
daylight
he
went
to
the
window
and
cautiously
looked
through
the
shutter
the
window
looked
south
and
he
could
not
see
the
sun
only
the
black
shadows
it
painted
in
the
ruts
of
the
road
that
slanted
up
the
hill
past
the
hopkins
house
it
must
be
late
afternoon
he
wondered
were
raoul
and
his
men
out
there
somewhere
looking
for
him
would
he
live
to
see
another
nightfall
his
head
ached
less
than
it
had
last
night
until
he
touched
it
then
the
pain
was
like
someone
pounding
a
nail
into
his
brain
the
bump
felt
as
big
as
a
hen
egg
opening
his
backpack
he
took
out
his
leather
medicine
bag
and
drew
out
the
stones
one
by
one
rubbing
his
fingers
over
each
he
opened
his
shirt
and
touched
the
tip
of
the
bear
claw
to
the
five
scars
on
his
chest
then
on
impulse
he
touched
it
to
the
old
scar
on
his
cheek
a
black
leather
bag
contained
his
surgical
instruments
two
saws
a
big
one
for
legs
and
a
smaller
one
for
arms
four
scalpels
lancets
for
bleeding
a
turnkey
for
pulling
teeth
a
probe
and
tongs
for
removing
bullets
a
small
jar
of
opium
any
of
those
things
might
be
needed
where
he
was
going
last
he
took
out
a
book
chosen
almost
at
random
from
his
small
collection
on
the
spine
of
its
brown
leather
cover
was
stamped
in
gold
milton
reverend
hale
had
recommended
that
he
take
a
bible
this
long
poem
giving
the
christian
account
of
creation
was
the
next
thing
to
a
bible
but
he
had
read
it
at
george
and
enjoyed
it
and
its
title
and
its
story
of
adam
and
eve
being
driven
out
of
the
garden
of
eden
made
him
think
of
how
he
was
dispossessed
perhaps
he
would
find
some
wisdom
or
guidance
in
the
book
today
he
thought
lost
it
may
be
that
i
returning
to
but
then
he
remembered
how
nancy
had
wanted
to
know
him
as
adam
knew
eve
he
leaving
behind
what
might
have
been
a
great
happiness
he
opened
the
book
and
read
the
first
verse
his
eye
fell
upon
high
on
a
throne
of
royal
state
which
far
outshone
the
wealth
of
and
of
or
where
the
gorgeous
east
with
richest
hand
on
her
kings
pearl
and
gold
satan
exalted
sat
sounded
like
raoul
with
his
fifty
spanish
dollars
and
his
steamboat
and
lead
mine
and
trading
post
raoul
was
better
fitted
to
be
satan
than
to
be
the
angel
at
the
gates
of
eden
keeping
sinners
away
he
heard
voices
nearby
one
faint
but
unmistakable
was
grandpapa
his
heart
leaped
he
quickly
repacked
his
treasures
he
pushed
the
curtain
aside
and
hurried
across
the
hall
it
was
a
joy
to
see
elysée
eyes
looking
at
him
open
and
bright
i
do
not
as
a
rule
believe
in
miracles
elysée
said
smiling
at
auguste
but
it
certainly
a
miracle
that
you
could
charge
a
man
pointing
a
pistol
at
your
chest
and
come
out
with
nothing
but
a
bump
on
your
head
it
a
bad
enough
bump
grandpapa
said
auguste
dragging
over
the
chair
he
had
sat
in
last
night
and
pulling
it
close
to
the
side
of
the
bed
i
wish
i
could
stay
and
doctor
you
our
local
midwife
says
i
too
will
heal
said
elysée
i
can
move
all
my
arms
and
legs
without
extreme
pain
i
think
the
worst
injury
was
to
my
hip
he
touched
his
right
side
gently
i
bruised
it
when
i
fell
there
swelling
there
but
i
can
move
my
leg
the
hip
is
not
broken
he
closed
his
eyes
and
auguste
knew
that
the
old
man
was
feeling
a
sharper
pain
in
his
heart
than
in
his
bones
you
must
not
think
of
staying
here
i
am
afraid
raoul
is
perfectly
capable
of
murdering
you
son
dead
the
other
an
enemy
and
now
i
must
leave
him
how
much
more
can
he
stand
nicole
was
sitting
beside
elysée
bed
just
as
she
had
been
last
night
when
auguste
arrived
he
wondered
whether
she
had
slept
nicole
smiled
at
him
i
sent
the
children
down
to
play
by
the
river
having
two
injured
adults
to
care
for
has
been
very
restful
for
me
elysée
sat
up
a
little
straighter
nicole
quickly
plumping
the
pillows
behind
him
and
turned
a
sharp
stare
at
auguste
nicole
and
frank
told
me
about
your
plan
to
go
back
to
the
sauk
i
can
understand
why
you
would
wish
to
do
so
but
that
is
not
the
only
choice
open
to
you
you
might
consider
going
where
people
are
much
more
civilized
than
they
are
around
here
back
east
where
you
were
educated
emilie
and
charles
would
be
happy
i
am
sure
to
take
you
in
again
for
a
time
and
i
could
help
you
i
have
money
banked
with
irving
and
sons
on
wall
street
you
could
continue
your
education
and
follow
the
medical
profession
in
new
york
wishing
he
did
not
have
to
refuse
the
old
man
auguste
said
grandpapa
i
must
go
to
the
only
other
people
i
love
in
the
world
as
much
as
i
love
you
and
aunt
nicole
elysée
uttered
a
little
sigh
i
understand
loyalty
pulls
you
back
to
your
mother
people
it
is
a
family
trait
i
suppose
your
father
must
have
told
you
about
the
mystery
around
the
origin
of
our
family
name
yes
grandpapa
wanting
him
to
know
his
french
forebears
pierre
had
spent
hours
with
auguste
recounting
their
names
and
deeds
and
he
had
told
him
that
strangely
the
de
marion
records
extended
back
only
to
the
late
thirteenth
century
though
the
family
was
wealthy
and
powerful
even
then
according
to
a
murky
legend
one
ancestor
had
committed
treason
against
the
king
and
that
one
son
had
deserted
his
wife
and
children
simply
disappeared
feeling
the
original
name
whatever
it
had
been
irreparably
tarnished
the
first
recorded
count
de
marion
had
destroyed
all
record
of
it
apparently
with
the
approval
and
help
of
the
royal
authorities
and
had
taken
his
mother
family
name
instead
the
story
had
left
auguste
wishing
he
could
use
his
shaman
powers
to
learn
more
but
he
doubted
that
the
sauk
spirits
could
see
clear
across
the
ocean
elysée
said
we
de
marions
sometimes
display
an
overabundance
of
loyalty
as
if
we
were
still
trying
to
expiate
that
ancient
guilt
puzzled
auguste
said
there
nothing
wrong
with
loyalty
is
there
certainly
not
but
remember
this
if
i
had
let
loyalty
keep
me
in
france
we
would
not
be
here
in
this
primeval
paradise
sees
this
land
as
a
paradise
too
but
it
has
not
been
kind
to
looking
back
grandpapa
do
you
think
you
would
have
done
better
to
have
stayed
in
france
elysée
laughed
a
short
humorless
bark
not
at
all
i
would
almost
certainly
have
lost
my
head
to
dr
guillotine
wonderful
invention
our
lands
would
have
been
confiscated
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
family
but
now
with
most
of
the
wealth
in
raoul
hands
elysée
raised
a
hand
and
shook
his
head
this
is
not
the
end
i
do
not
believe
in
divine
intervention
but
i
do
believe
there
is
a
law
of
nature
that
says
a
bad
man
will
do
badly
in
the
end
auguste
was
about
to
reply
when
he
heard
footsteps
coming
down
the
road
toward
the
house
reminding
him
of
how
quiet
it
had
been
ever
since
he
awakened
a
good
part
of
the
town
was
sleeping
off
raoul
old
kaintuck
he
suspected
he
heard
the
door
open
and
close
below
a
moment
later
frank
came
into
the
room
carrying
a
long
rifle
with
an
ammunition
bag
and
a
powder
horn
slung
over
his
shoulder
well
i
bought
you
a
little
bateau
that
will
get
you
across
the
mississippi
he
said
for
five
dollars
from
an
old
trapper
who
does
feel
up
to
going
out
this
winter
and
for
another
twenty
dollars
i
got
him
to
throw
in
his
second
best
rifle
and
a
good
supply
of
ammunition
he
smiled
grimly
at
auguste
i
expect
you
find
this
useful
over
in
ioway
auguste
nodded
i
eat
better
but
dollars
frank
that
too
much
for
you
to
spend
on
me
he
felt
a
warm
gratitude
toward
the
plump
man
who
was
risking
so
much
to
help
him
newspaper
his
printing
business
and
his
carpentry
all
together
could
hardly
bring
in
dollars
in
a
month
little
enough
to
feed
a
family
of
ten
elysée
said
i
told
you
i
had
some
money
salted
away
auguste
let
the
boat
and
the
rifle
be
my
gift
to
you
auguste
reached
out
and
squeezed
his
grandfather
bony
hand
frank
said
i
moved
the
boat
about
half
a
mile
below
town
and
hidden
it
we
should
be
able
to
get
down
there
unseen
after
dark
nicole
said
if
auguste
is
leaving
as
raoul
wants
him
to
why
raoul
just
let
him
go
frank
said
we
ca
take
that
chance
i
believe
raoul
wo
be
content
unless
he
kills
auguste
auguste
shuddered
inwardly
at
the
thought
that
there
was
in
the
world
a
man
who
would
not
be
satisfied
until
he
was
dead
he
could
not
live
with
that
kind
of
fear
he
asked
the
white
bear
his
spirit
guide
to
give
him
courage
he
tried
to
push
the
fear
out
of
his
mind
he
stood
up
to
go
back
to
the
room
where
he
had
slept
he
would
clean
and
repack
the
things
he
was
taking
he
decided
he
would
get
busy
getting
ready
and
not
give
himself
time
to
think
about
being
afraid
but
nightfall
seemed
a
long
way
off
at
nine
in
the
evening
by
the
seth
thomas
clock
in
printing
shop
which
he
reset
every
day
at
sunset
it
was
dark
enough
and
the
town
was
quiet
enough
for
auguste
to
leave
he
held
ample
body
tight
and
kissed
her
shook
hands
with
the
boys
and
kissed
the
girls
his
grandfather
had
drifted
off
to
sleep
again
but
the
old
man
had
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
and
they
had
said
their
in
the
afternoon
the
road
down
the
bluff
from
the
town
to
the
bottomland
was
empty
most
people
in
victor
went
to
bed
soon
after
sunset
and
those
who
would
be
up
in
the
taproom
of
the
trading
post
inn
auguste
did
see
candlelight
flickering
in
a
log
cabin
they
passed
a
silhouette
appeared
in
the
window
just
as
he
looked
in
a
man
reached
out
and
slammed
the
shutters
closed
bad
luck
we
should
pass
that
house
just
as
he
came
to
the
window
frank
said
one
of
raoul
men
but
he
more
than
likely
still
half
drunk
frank
and
auguste
followed
the
road
past
fields
of
corn
ready
for
harvesting
their
way
lighted
by
the
nearly
full
moon
up
ahead
the
wooded
sides
of
the
bluff
came
down
to
the
water
edge
frank
led
auguste
out
on
a
spit
not
until
he
was
nearly
on
top
of
the
bateau
did
auguste
see
it
frank
had
pulled
it
up
out
of
the
water
covered
it
with
branches
and
tied
it
to
the
roots
of
a
tree
that
had
toppled
into
the
water
undercut
by
the
river
with
sinking
heart
auguste
saw
that
though
the
riverboat
was
small
it
would
be
heavier
and
harder
to
row
than
a
canoe
well
frank
had
done
his
best
and
now
he
would
have
to
do
best
his
heart
leaped
with
fear
as
he
heard
hoofbeats
horsemen
coming
down
the
road
from
victor
frank
stopped
working
on
the
boat
and
lifted
his
head
damn
that
skunk
must
have
seen
you
after
all
the
pounding
was
coming
rapidly
closer
auguste
heart
was
beating
as
fast
as
the
oncoming
hooves
he
saw
the
horsemen
by
moonlight
of
them
racing
through
the
high
corn
frank
and
auguste
pushed
the
little
boat
into
the
water
bow
first
pointed
stern
resting
on
the
shore
auguste
put
his
pack
in
the
stern
and
the
rifle
and
ammunition
in
the
bow
where
they
were
more
likely
to
stay
dry
the
current
pulled
the
bow
downstream
the
flat
bottom
grinding
in
the
mud
auguste
saw
a
flash
and
heard
a
loud
boom
something
whistled
through
the
bare
branches
of
a
bush
beside
him
he
leaped
into
the
boat
here
beef
and
biscuit
frank
tossed
a
bag
to
auguste
who
set
it
on
the
seat
beside
him
frank
pushed
the
bateau
stern
free
now
row
for
your
life
pulling
as
hard
and
fast
as
he
could
auguste
steered
diagonally
into
the
mississippi
trying
to
get
beyond
pistol
range
without
spending
all
his
strength
fighting
the
current
hopkins
goddamn
it
i
kill
if
he
gets
away
raoul
voice
auguste
wished
he
had
time
to
load
his
rifle
and
shoot
back
but
if
he
stopped
rowing
they
were
sure
to
get
him
five
bright
red
flashes
and
five
shots
roared
out
one
after
the
other
from
shore
one
of
those
men
is
eli
greenglove
i
dead
for
auguste
heard
a
sharp
rap
on
the
side
of
the
boat
and
splashes
in
the
water
on
his
left
he
felt
naked
sitting
up
in
the
boat
pulling
frantically
on
the
oars
he
could
stop
rowing
and
lie
down
using
the
side
of
the
boat
as
a
shield
but
then
he
would
remain
within
range
drifting
south
along
the
riverbank
and
raoul
and
his
men
could
follow
him
and
shoot
at
him
at
their
leisure
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
kept
rowing
his
shoulder
muscles
feeling
as
if
they
were
about
to
tear
loose
from
his
bones
he
heard
a
ball
whiz
past
his
head
they
must
have
stopped
riding
to
reload
and
take
better
aim
another
ball
smashed
into
the
boat
just
ahead
of
the
wooden
oarlock
his
body
was
coated
with
the
cold
sweat
of
fear
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
sit
here
a
target
in
the
moonlight
and
pull
on
the
oars
with
all
his
strength
if
he
missed
one
stroke
it
might
be
his
death
do
not
let
raoul
take
revenge
on
pistol
balls
splashed
water
into
the
boat
redbird
wickiup
white
bear
rowed
upstream
on
the
ioway
river
past
stands
of
weeping
willow
whose
yellowing
fronds
drooped
into
the
dark
green
water
even
though
the
current
was
at
its
weakest
now
his
arms
and
shoulders
felt
as
if
they
been
beaten
with
clubs
if
only
frank
had
been
able
to
find
a
canoe
for
him
instead
of
this
heavy
bateau
that
he
had
to
push
across
the
great
river
and
now
up
the
ioway
his
heart
fluttered
in
his
chest
like
a
trapped
bird
as
he
sensed
himself
coming
closer
to
the
british
band
winter
hunting
camp
he
had
thought
he
would
be
happy
at
this
homecoming
but
he
was
terrified
how
would
they
receive
him
after
six
years
they
must
think
he
had
forgotten
all
about
them
would
they
despise
him
maybe
they
would
just
make
fun
of
him
and
in
what
state
would
he
find
the
british
band
they
had
to
get
through
the
summer
without
the
crops
they
always
raised
had
any
friends
been
shot
by
white
snipers
during
the
siege
of
saukenuk
how
many
weakened
by
hunger
might
be
ill
or
dead
would
his
mother
be
alive
and
what
of
redbird
he
had
already
met
just
by
chance
one
member
of
the
band
three
horses
who
had
been
fishing
in
the
shallows
on
the
ioway
shore
of
the
great
river
and
three
horses
had
certainly
been
happy
to
see
him
jumped
on
his
pony
and
had
said
he
would
ride
back
to
the
camp
with
the
news
that
white
bear
was
back
he
was
so
excited
that
he
did
not
wait
for
white
bear
to
ask
any
questions
about
how
his
people
had
fared
so
they
would
all
be
waiting
for
him
by
the
time
he
got
there
the
thought
frightened
him
all
the
more
ahead
a
row
of
bark
and
dugout
canoes
lay
bottoms
up
on
a
dirt
embankment
he
saw
a
flash
of
red
in
the
trees
near
the
canoes
for
a
moment
he
thought
with
a
joyous
leap
of
his
heart
that
it
might
be
redbird
then
a
man
wearing
a
deep
red
blanket
stepped
out
of
the
woods
he
stood
over
the
beached
canoes
with
his
arms
folded
wolf
paw
his
eyes
were
like
splinters
of
coal
and
the
black
circles
he
had
painted
around
them
gave
him
a
terrifying
aspect
the
crest
of
deer
hair
that
sprouted
from
his
shaven
skull
seemed
strange
and
savage
to
white
bear
after
six
years
away
from
the
sauk
white
bear
rowed
in
close
to
the
riverbank
uncertain
how
to
greet
wolf
paw
the
brave
said
nothing
did
nothing
a
maple
branch
swayed
in
the
wind
red
leaves
fell
and
sunlight
flashed
from
a
tomahawk
that
wolf
paw
was
holding
white
bear
belly
knotted
he
skidded
the
boat
to
a
halt
on
the
bank
a
short
distance
downriver
from
wolf
paw
he
climbed
out
the
front
end
pulled
the
boat
up
on
the
bank
unloaded
it
and
turned
it
over
wolf
paw
watched
in
silence
as
white
bear
slung
his
pack
and
bags
on
his
back
picked
up
his
rifle
and
rested
it
on
his
shoulder
looking
at
wolf
paw
red
crest
and
blanket
and
buckskin
trousers
white
bear
realized
how
strange
he
himself
must
seem
to
wolf
paw
in
the
green
clawhammer
jacket
he
had
worn
to
his
father
funeral
now
they
were
face
to
face
will
wait
for
him
to
move
if
i
have
to
stand
here
till
sunset
and
all
through
the
night
he
chose
this
strange
way
of
meeting
me
let
him
show
me
what
is
in
his
he
heard
the
boughs
creaking
in
the
wind
around
him
river
water
rippled
over
the
stones
along
the
bank
he
heard
a
redbird
whistling
in
the
distance
wolf
paw
drew
a
deep
breath
opened
his
mouth
and
let
out
a
war
whoop
white
bear
heart
gave
a
great
thump
and
he
fell
back
a
step
he
heard
rage
in
the
whoop
and
the
frustration
wolf
paw
was
angry
at
him
why
maybe
just
for
coming
back
wolf
paw
held
the
tomahawk
high
corded
muscles
and
dark
veins
stood
out
in
his
rigid
arm
two
feathers
dyed
red
danced
just
under
the
steel
head
he
repeated
his
war
whoop
and
then
his
lips
drew
back
from
clenched
white
teeth
he
whirled
and
plunged
into
the
woods
leaving
white
bear
shaken
and
he
stood
still
listening
to
wolf
paw
crashing
through
the
trees
and
shrubs
kicking
piles
of
leaves
until
the
noise
died
away
in
the
distance
no
sauk
ran
noisily
through
the
woods
like
that
unless
driven
by
some
madness
white
bear
sighed
oddly
he
felt
less
frightened
than
he
had
before
he
met
wolf
paw
before
he
had
not
known
what
to
expect
now
he
felt
ready
for
anything
he
strode
into
the
woods
following
three
horses
directions
as
he
walked
he
began
to
hear
the
sounds
of
people
voices
and
dogs
barking
gradually
they
drew
nearer
until
at
last
he
broke
through
the
trees
into
a
clearing
the
sight
made
his
eyes
brim
with
tears
a
hundred
or
more
women
in
brown
fringed
skirts
were
facing
him
and
as
he
came
forward
they
rushed
to
form
a
ring
around
him
his
vision
blurred
as
he
recognized
faces
he
had
not
seen
in
six
years
beyond
the
women
he
could
see
the
camp
of
the
british
band
in
his
joy
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
wickiups
were
bathed
in
a
golden
light
rings
of
gray
domes
began
near
the
trees
where
he
stood
and
spread
into
the
tall
yellow
prairie
grass
before
the
wickiups
he
could
see
what
the
women
had
been
working
at
tasks
abandoned
for
the
moment
clothing
being
mended
skins
stretched
meat
and
fish
cleaned
and
set
on
frames
to
dry
white
bear
is
here
cried
one
woman
and
he
recognized
water
flows
fast
plump
wife
of
three
horses
three
horses
a
short
man
with
broad
shoulders
stood
beside
his
wife
his
nose
was
flat
and
spread
out
white
bear
did
not
remember
it
that
way
something
must
have
happened
to
three
horses
while
he
was
gone
has
happened
to
them
while
i
was
i
told
you
white
bear
had
come
back
three
horses
said
over
and
over
again
white
bear
breathed
in
the
familiar
smells
of
campfire
smoke
and
roasting
meat
of
leather
and
freshly
cut
wood
and
tobacco
smoke
his
delighted
eyes
took
in
quillwork
and
beadwork
and
paint
blankets
and
ribbons
bodies
clad
in
fringed
buckskin
warm
brown
faces
dark
friendly
eyes
murmuring
greetings
he
searched
the
crowd
for
specially
loved
faces
where
is
owl
carver
he
asked
after
such
a
long
time
the
sauk
language
came
awkwardly
to
his
lips
three
horses
said
owl
carver
visits
the
camps
of
the
fox
and
the
kickapoo
to
invite
them
to
black
hawk
council
is
black
hawk
planning
now
white
bear
did
not
like
the
sound
of
the
news
but
there
would
be
time
to
think
about
it
later
where
is
sun
woman
my
mother
water
flows
fast
spoke
up
she
has
gone
to
gather
medicine
plants
she
looked
as
cheerful
as
he
remembered
she
always
had
but
her
eyes
penetrated
him
will
no
one
find
her
and
tell
her
that
i
am
here
water
flows
fast
said
redbird
should
go
and
tell
sun
woman
redbird
lives
with
sun
woman
now
he
felt
almost
dizzy
at
the
sound
of
her
name
a
name
he
had
not
heard
spoken
aloud
in
six
years
as
soon
as
water
flows
fast
spoke
she
started
to
giggle
putting
her
hands
over
her
mouth
many
of
the
other
women
in
the
group
giggled
too
white
bear
wanted
to
hide
his
burning
face
he
had
forgotten
how
painful
it
could
be
to
be
made
fun
of
by
those
who
knew
him
so
well
but
joy
blazed
up
in
his
chest
redbird
living
with
sun
woman
he
wanted
to
whoop
with
happiness
even
as
wolf
paw
had
whooped
with
rage
that
could
only
mean
that
she
had
not
taken
a
husband
then
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
stiffened
his
body
to
hide
his
feelings
he
looked
at
the
laughing
faces
all
around
him
especially
the
bright
curious
eyes
of
water
flows
fast
if
they
saw
how
excited
he
was
they
would
laugh
at
him
all
the
more
trying
to
keep
his
voice
steady
he
asked
where
is
my
wickiup
with
a
knowing
smile
but
what
was
it
that
she
knew
water
flows
fast
beckoned
to
the
wickiup
of
sun
woman
and
redbird
come
i
will
take
you
she
turned
her
fringed
skirt
swinging
the
women
parted
to
make
way
for
her
shouldering
his
rifle
white
bear
followed
three
horses
walked
beside
him
white
bear
heard
the
whisper
of
many
moccasins
and
the
murmur
of
many
voices
behind
him
water
flows
fast
marched
up
to
a
wickiup
near
the
center
of
the
camp
the
dark
rounded
shelter
of
sheets
of
elm
bark
and
tree
limbs
was
small
just
big
enough
for
two
people
three
at
the
most
white
bear
heart
was
beating
like
a
dance
drum
the
flap
was
pulled
down
over
the
door
showing
that
if
anyone
was
within
they
wanted
privacy
the
wickiup
of
sun
woman
said
water
flows
fast
and
of
redbird
she
looked
at
him
expectantly
there
is
no
one
here
said
white
bear
this
brought
shouts
of
laughter
from
the
women
around
him
he
wished
they
would
all
go
away
i
saw
redbird
go
in
there
said
water
flows
fast
and
i
did
not
see
her
come
out
white
bear
discomfort
increased
as
he
watched
her
face
redden
and
her
cheeks
puff
out
it
seemed
that
mirth
would
make
her
burst
every
beat
of
his
heart
seemed
to
shake
his
whole
body
he
looked
around
slowly
trying
to
calm
himself
even
if
redbird
had
waited
for
him
his
sudden
return
must
have
shocked
her
she
needed
time
to
prepare
herself
to
meet
him
and
like
him
she
did
not
want
all
these
women
watching
their
meeting
and
laughing
he
would
simply
have
to
wait
until
redbird
was
ready
to
greet
him
a
rack
of
crisscrossed
wooden
sticks
for
drying
skins
stood
by
the
closed
doorway
slowly
deliberately
he
walked
over
to
the
rack
leaned
his
rifle
against
it
and
laid
down
his
pack
and
bags
then
turning
his
back
on
the
wickiup
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
water
flows
fast
looked
at
him
thank
you
for
showing
me
the
way
he
said
hiding
his
embarrassment
he
made
himself
smile
at
the
hundred
or
more
women
gathered
to
watch
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
water
flows
fast
asked
i
am
going
to
rest
and
thank
earthmaker
for
seeing
me
here
safely
white
bear
is
a
man
of
sense
said
three
horses
smiling
his
approval
is
that
all
water
flows
fast
asked
i
am
going
to
wait
for
sun
woman
my
mother
is
all
that
all
said
white
bear
three
horses
who
was
no
taller
than
his
wife
gripped
her
plump
upper
arm
firmly
let
white
bear
alone
but
water
flows
fast
started
to
protest
and
her
husband
jerked
her
arm
we
will
leave
this
man
in
peace
he
said
her
lower
lip
jutting
out
water
flows
fast
let
three
horses
pull
her
away
through
the
crowd
white
bear
sat
with
his
eyes
downcast
to
discourage
people
from
talking
to
him
gradually
the
rest
of
the
crowd
dispersed
the
back
of
his
neck
bristled
he
knew
redbird
was
in
the
wickiup
behind
him
sooner
or
later
she
must
come
out
to
have
her
so
close
after
all
this
time
to
know
she
was
there
and
to
hear
nothing
but
that
terrible
silence
and
yet
to
sit
with
his
back
to
that
curtain
all
this
was
a
torment
for
him
the
urge
to
jump
up
and
tear
the
curtain
away
pressed
against
his
resolve
to
hold
himself
still
he
thought
he
might
explode
like
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
he
forced
himself
to
breathe
slowly
and
pretend
that
he
was
hidden
in
shrubbery
with
a
bow
and
arrow
watching
for
a
deer
after
a
time
he
could
not
tell
how
much
time
a
face
was
peering
into
his
dark
and
square
the
brown
eyes
brimmed
with
tears
his
eyes
opened
wider
sun
woman
was
kneeling
before
him
my
son
she
reached
out
to
him
and
he
scrambled
to
embrace
her
when
her
strong
arms
held
him
he
felt
like
a
little
boy
again
he
sat
back
to
look
at
her
dear
face
wet
with
tears
resting
beside
her
on
the
ground
was
the
familiar
basket
with
blue
cloth
cover
that
she
used
to
gather
herbs
he
looked
around
for
the
sun
it
was
low
and
red
on
the
western
horizon
it
had
been
high
when
he
sat
down
here
he
must
have
gone
on
a
spirit
walk
i
knew
it
would
be
like
this
sun
woman
said
it
would
come
one
day
when
i
least
expected
it
my
son
would
be
back
again
he
sighed
deeply
to
see
my
mother
makes
my
heart
as
big
as
the
prairie
they
sat
facing
each
other
and
she
gripped
his
shoulders
you
are
a
man
now
a
very
handsome
man
she
ran
her
hand
along
his
cheek
and
his
whole
face
felt
warm
he
kept
his
gaze
fixed
on
her
eyes
she
said
you
have
learned
much
you
have
been
hurt
your
face
is
scarred
she
followed
the
line
of
the
scar
with
her
thumb
leaning
forward
to
peer
still
more
closely
at
him
i
see
sadness
in
you
your
father
is
dead
that
is
why
you
have
come
back
she
sat
back
and
closed
her
eyes
for
a
silent
moment
then
she
began
a
song
for
the
dead
earthmaker
show
him
the
way
lead
him
over
the
bridge
of
stars
and
sunbeams
along
the
westward
trail
of
souls
take
his
soul
into
your
heart
after
she
had
finished
the
song
sun
woman
wiped
the
tears
from
her
face
with
her
blunt
fingers
she
reached
out
and
stroked
his
cheeks
as
well
he
had
not
realized
that
he
was
crying
but
grieving
for
pierre
reminded
him
to
reach
into
his
medicine
bag
i
have
a
gift
for
you
mother
he
took
out
the
flat
silver
case
with
its
velvet
neck
cord
opened
it
and
showed
her
the
pair
of
spectacles
marchette
had
brought
to
him
from
victoire
do
you
know
these
your
father
wore
circles
of
glass
like
these
to
see
the
marks
on
the
talking
paper
yes
these
are
the
same
ones
he
closed
the
case
and
pressed
it
into
her
hand
now
you
have
something
that
was
close
to
star
arrow
she
said
he
was
with
me
for
five
summers
only
but
in
spirit
ever
since
now
i
will
feel
even
closer
to
him
she
slipped
the
ribbon
over
her
head
and
dropped
the
case
down
the
front
of
her
doeskin
dress
he
saw
the
tracks
of
more
tears
on
her
smooth
brown
cheeks
in
the
fading
light
this
time
she
did
not
wipe
them
away
tell
me
all
that
has
happened
to
you
she
said
as
white
bear
talked
he
deliberately
made
his
voice
loud
enough
to
carry
so
that
redbird
in
the
wickiup
might
hear
when
he
was
through
telling
his
story
he
felt
weighed
down
by
guilt
i
fled
mother
even
though
i
promised
my
father
i
would
care
for
the
land
and
smoked
tobacco
with
him
to
seal
the
promise
should
i
have
stayed
she
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
squeezed
you
kept
your
promise
as
far
as
you
were
able
that
is
all
the
calumet
requires
your
father
would
not
want
you
to
die
fighting
for
that
land
it
is
better
that
you
come
back
here
and
be
a
sauk
again
white
bear
looked
down
unable
to
meet
sun
woman
eyes
feeling
an
ache
deep
in
the
center
of
his
body
remembering
the
great
stone
and
log
house
the
blizzard
of
blossoms
in
the
orchards
the
fields
of
green
corn
and
golden
wheat
the
herds
that
darkened
the
hillsides
he
wanted
to
clutch
his
chest
where
it
felt
as
if
it
had
been
torn
open
he
could
not
so
easily
forget
victoire
i
was
at
victoire
i
yearned
to
go
back
to
my
people
now
i
am
with
my
people
and
i
miss
victoire
will
my
heart
never
be
at
peace
nancy
had
wanted
him
so
desperately
before
they
parted
redbird
would
not
even
let
him
see
her
white
bear
saw
that
once
again
women
had
started
to
gather
nearby
among
them
the
water
flows
fast
and
now
white
bear
saw
another
familiar
face
he
had
not
seen
earlier
redbird
mother
wind
bends
grass
she
glowered
at
him
as
she
always
had
her
fists
on
her
broad
hips
earthmaker
why
would
redbird
not
come
out
and
speak
to
him
a
dozen
cawing
crows
flew
over
the
camp
laughing
at
him
he
heard
a
movement
behind
him
a
rustling
of
the
curtain
he
dared
not
look
around
a
voice
at
his
back
said
go
away
white
bear
a
cool
sweet
flow
poured
from
his
heart
like
a
mountain
spring
at
the
sound
of
redbird
voice
he
unfolded
his
legs
stiff
from
hours
of
sitting
and
pushed
himself
to
his
feet
he
turned
weakness
washed
over
him
he
thought
he
might
fall
to
the
ground
redbird
stood
before
him
her
cheeks
flushed
her
slanting
eyes
sparkling
with
anger
her
face
was
thinner
than
he
remembered
her
lips
fuller
she
still
wore
a
fringe
of
her
hair
over
her
forehead
standing
silent
and
he
felt
he
must
look
utterly
foolish
go
away
redbird
said
again
we
do
not
want
you
here
to
see
you
is
a
sunrise
in
my
heart
redbird
to
see
you
is
a
foul
day
in
my
stomach
reeling
back
from
her
anger
white
bear
saw
a
little
boy
standing
in
the
doorway
behind
her
he
was
he
wore
a
loincloth
of
red
flannel
and
fringed
buckskin
leggings
he
was
shifting
uncomfortably
from
one
moccasined
foot
to
the
other
and
clutching
at
himself
under
the
loincloth
now
white
bear
understood
why
redbird
had
finally
come
out
she
and
the
boy
must
have
been
inside
the
wickiup
all
the
time
he
was
sitting
out
here
and
the
boy
was
about
to
burst
it
would
have
been
funny
except
that
a
much
more
important
discovery
struck
white
bear
he
looked
closer
at
the
boy
urgent
eyes
blue
eyes
white
bear
own
eyes
were
brown
but
pierre
were
blue
could
eye
color
be
passed
in
the
blood
from
grandfather
to
grandson
around
his
eyes
in
the
narrow
shape
of
his
head
his
long
chin
coming
to
a
sharp
point
white
bear
could
see
that
this
boy
was
a
de
marion
is
our
son
redbird
and
mine
joy
blazed
up
in
his
body
like
a
fire
that
warms
but
does
not
hurt
he
asked
what
is
his
name
redbird
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
at
the
boy
what
are
you
standing
there
for
you
have
to
go
go
the
boy
ran
off
toward
the
woods
white
bear
watched
him
he
ran
well
even
though
he
was
very
young
and
most
uncomfortable
white
bear
wanted
to
reach
out
and
take
redbird
into
his
arms
she
turned
back
to
him
her
fists
clenched
at
her
sides
her
nostrils
flaring
in
fury
you
want
to
know
what
his
name
is
now
five
winters
after
he
was
born
he
turned
to
sun
woman
does
she
have
a
husband
sun
woman
raised
her
eyebrows
there
were
many
braves
who
wished
to
marry
her
wolf
paw
was
most
insistent
he
offered
owl
carver
ten
horses
little
stabbing
chief
of
the
fox
sought
her
there
were
others
besides
wolf
paw
had
wanted
to
marry
her
that
must
have
been
the
meaning
of
that
strange
encounter
outside
the
camp
wolf
paw
probably
wanted
to
kill
him
please
sun
woman
do
not
talk
to
this
man
about
me
redbird
said
you
are
his
mother
and
a
mother
to
me
but
you
can
not
make
peace
between
us
true
said
sun
woman
picking
up
her
basket
of
herbs
and
bark
only
you
can
do
that
daughter
she
turned
to
white
bear
if
redbird
does
not
welcome
you
into
this
wickiup
i
share
with
her
and
eagle
feather
i
can
not
invite
you
inside
with
that
sun
woman
turned
abruptly
and
trudged
off
toward
the
river
feather
redbird
threw
an
exasperated
look
after
sun
woman
redbird
anger
made
white
bear
feel
as
if
one
of
the
long
cannonballs
had
crushed
his
chest
perhaps
if
he
could
put
his
arms
around
her
she
would
remember
how
she
had
loved
him
he
took
a
step
toward
her
reaching
for
her
she
stepped
back
quickly
bent
down
and
picked
up
a
rock
go
away
now
graceful
all
her
movements
the
rock
was
gray
and
somewhat
larger
than
her
fist
it
had
sharp
irregular
edges
and
looked
as
if
it
had
been
used
to
chip
arrowheads
he
said
you
would
not
be
this
angry
at
me
if
you
did
not
want
me
back
why
did
you
refuse
every
man
who
asked
for
you
her
face
twisted
with
rage
she
threw
the
rock
for
an
instant
he
was
blinded
as
it
hit
his
cheek
stunning
him
and
his
head
snapped
back
he
felt
a
pounding
pain
in
the
back
of
his
skull
as
his
vision
cleared
the
ache
from
being
hit
with
a
rifle
butt
had
come
back
he
heard
gasps
of
dismay
from
some
of
the
watching
women
laughter
from
others
wind
bends
grass
called
out
scornfully
i
am
ashamed
to
call
this
fool
my
daughter
i
cast
her
out
of
my
lodge
because
she
would
accept
no
suitors
at
last
comes
the
one
who
ruined
her
for
all
the
others
and
she
drives
him
away
with
a
rock
i
think
we
should
throw
rocks
at
her
the
crowd
laughter
was
louder
although
white
bear
saw
that
wind
bends
grass
did
not
mean
to
be
funny
his
left
cheekbone
throbbed
the
cheek
raoul
knife
had
scarred
and
he
felt
a
trickle
of
blood
but
he
would
not
let
himself
lift
his
hand
to
wipe
it
away
redbird
hand
went
up
to
her
own
face
as
if
the
rock
had
hit
her
her
slanting
eyes
widened
with
a
look
of
horror
she
whirled
and
ducked
through
her
dark
doorway
go
in
there
after
her
white
bear
one
of
the
women
called
he
would
not
do
that
he
would
not
go
into
her
wickiup
until
she
invited
him
and
in
spite
of
the
heaviness
in
his
heart
in
spite
of
the
ache
in
his
cheekbone
and
the
pounding
in
his
head
he
believed
that
sooner
or
later
invite
him
she
would
he
turned
his
back
on
the
empty
doorway
and
sat
down
again
the
boy
was
standing
before
him
a
golden
glow
filled
white
bear
chest
you
are
hurt
said
the
boy
it
is
nothing
eagle
feather
a
man
must
endure
pain
without
complaint
did
my
mother
do
that
to
you
she
wanted
to
punish
me
for
staying
away
from
you
and
her
for
so
long
my
name
is
white
bear
i
know
what
your
name
is
when
he
heard
that
he
was
sure
that
he
would
win
her
back
the
boy
darted
around
him
resting
his
hands
on
his
knees
white
bear
closed
his
eyes
and
let
his
mind
dwell
on
a
vast
shape
owl
carver
had
said
that
when
a
man
wished
to
send
his
spirit
on
a
journey
in
the
other
world
he
need
only
think
of
his
other
self
he
saw
the
huge
golden
eyes
the
massive
head
the
towering
body
soon
he
and
the
bear
spirit
were
walking
together
toward
the
sun
redbird
did
not
understand
herself
she
hated
white
bear
but
when
she
saw
blood
running
down
his
face
she
had
hated
herself
she
sat
in
darkness
biting
her
lips
to
keep
from
screaming
she
crept
to
the
doorway
and
pushed
the
curtain
open
a
crack
she
could
see
him
sitting
again
with
his
back
to
her
his
shoulders
broad
in
his
green
pale
eyes
coat
she
drew
back
into
the
wickiup
and
saw
the
small
steel
knife
she
used
to
cut
up
food
gleaming
near
the
embers
of
her
fire
she
picked
it
up
and
held
its
edge
against
her
feverish
cheek
the
last
light
of
day
fell
on
her
as
the
doorway
curtain
rose
startled
she
almost
cut
herself
she
whirled
to
see
eagle
feather
staring
at
her
she
threw
the
knife
down
on
the
floor
eagle
feather
gave
her
a
questioning
look
but
said
nothing
she
drew
him
down
beside
her
and
started
telling
him
the
story
of
why
the
leaves
change
colors
and
fall
to
the
ground
in
autumn
it
was
dark
outside
when
sun
woman
came
back
from
the
river
where
she
had
been
washing
the
plants
she
had
gathered
redbird
was
afraid
sun
woman
would
ask
her
to
forgive
white
bear
but
the
older
woman
said
nothing
they
passed
what
seemed
like
an
ordinary
evening
talking
and
telling
stories
and
singing
but
redbird
could
not
forget
that
figure
sitting
like
a
tree
stump
just
beyond
the
curtain
much
later
she
went
out
and
by
the
light
from
tonight
full
moon
of
falling
leaves
looked
into
white
bear
face
it
was
motionless
as
if
carved
from
wood
he
did
not
seem
to
see
her
he
must
be
on
a
spirit
journey
hot
with
rage
she
kicked
at
his
knee
what
right
had
he
to
go
on
a
spirit
journey
leaving
his
body
to
haunt
her
wickiup
the
impact
of
her
moccasined
foot
shook
him
slightly
but
it
was
like
kicking
a
bundle
of
pelts
redbird
breath
came
out
in
a
cloud
lit
by
the
full
moon
she
gathered
up
some
twigs
brought
them
into
the
wickiup
and
added
them
to
the
fire
sun
woman
went
out
carrying
a
blanket
redbird
saw
her
draping
it
over
her
son
shoulders
does
not
need
redbird
thought
remembering
how
white
bear
had
come
back
seemingly
frozen
from
his
vision
quest
in
the
moon
of
ice
tightly
wrapped
in
her
own
blankets
with
eagle
feather
curled
up
in
the
shelter
of
her
body
redbird
lay
awake
thinking
that
she
had
never
in
her
life
slept
with
a
man
that
was
white
bear
fault
and
she
ground
her
teeth
in
the
dark
as
she
thought
of
the
wrongs
he
had
done
her
left
me
in
the
moon
of
first
buds
and
he
returns
in
the
moon
of
falling
leaves
six
summers
one
afternoon
they
had
been
lovers
and
then
he
had
gone
to
live
with
the
pale
eyes
for
nine
moons
she
had
carried
his
son
and
then
given
birth
to
him
he
had
not
been
here
to
give
the
baby
a
birth
name
owl
carver
the
baby
grandfather
had
to
do
that
embarrassed
at
the
necessity
complaining
that
the
people
were
laughing
at
their
family
she
knew
star
arrow
had
required
that
no
messages
pass
between
white
bear
and
the
tribe
but
if
white
bear
really
loved
her
could
he
not
have
broken
that
rule
even
if
he
had
smoked
the
calumet
with
star
arrow
at
least
once
for
six
summers
white
bear
had
been
as
silent
as
absent
as
if
he
were
dead
the
dead
sometimes
send
a
the
next
day
the
sky
was
cloudy
and
the
air
warmer
than
last
night
all
morning
long
women
walked
past
redbird
wickiup
looking
curiously
at
the
man
who
sat
there
motionless
like
redbird
herself
they
had
never
before
seen
a
man
while
his
spirit
had
gone
to
walk
the
bridge
of
stars
when
men
went
on
spirit
journeys
they
always
retired
to
the
forest
or
to
caves
in
the
afternoon
he
who
sits
in
grease
a
fox
brave
came
to
redbird
as
she
and
sun
woman
sat
before
their
doorway
plaiting
baskets
a
short
distance
from
white
bear
the
brave
was
carrying
a
stout
bustard
with
feathers
striped
brown
black
and
white
he
hunkered
down
facing
her
and
laid
the
bird
before
her
his
thick
lips
worked
nervously
this
is
for
white
bear
he
said
when
he
wakes
up
it
is
the
fattest
of
the
three
that
i
killed
this
morning
tell
him
that
he
who
sits
in
grease
gives
him
this
gift
i
want
him
to
ask
earthmaker
to
make
the
animals
come
to
me
more
willingly
when
i
hunt
them
before
redbird
could
protest
the
brave
stood
up
and
backed
away
his
eyes
timidly
averted
from
the
figure
outside
the
doorway
thinks
white
bear
is
holy
the
thought
made
her
more
angry
at
white
bear
than
ever
she
wanted
to
kick
him
again
but
women
were
watching
from
a
distance
and
she
knew
they
would
make
fun
of
her
get
she
said
softly
to
white
bear
go
she
said
grinding
her
teeth
she
wished
owl
carver
would
come
back
from
visiting
the
other
camps
to
put
a
stop
to
white
bear
torturing
her
like
this
he
might
force
me
to
accept
white
bear
as
my
amazingly
she
felt
a
lift
in
her
heart
at
this
thought
she
herself
could
never
forgive
white
bear
but
if
owl
carver
her
father
and
the
shaman
of
the
british
band
ordered
her
to
the
decision
would
be
made
for
her
then
at
least
this
torment
would
end
sun
woman
silently
picked
up
the
bustard
sat
down
and
began
plucking
the
feathers
piling
them
in
a
basket
to
use
for
adornments
and
bedding
to
escape
from
being
rubbed
raw
by
white
bear
presence
redbird
went
out
into
the
woods
along
the
ioway
river
as
sun
woman
had
done
yesterday
to
gather
herbs
the
medicine
plants
were
at
their
most
powerful
now
because
they
had
been
gaining
strength
all
summer
long
late
in
the
day
the
sky
darkened
rapidly
the
clouds
seemed
to
hang
so
low
that
she
could
reach
up
and
touch
them
she
heard
the
first
drops
pattering
on
the
branches
above
her
as
the
rain
started
to
fall
faster
it
drummed
on
her
head
and
shoulders
sighing
at
having
to
give
up
this
comforting
work
she
put
a
lid
on
her
basket
stood
up
and
started
back
for
the
camp
her
doeskin
shirt
and
skirt
kept
the
rain
off
her
body
but
her
hair
was
soaked
and
her
face
was
streaming
by
the
time
she
got
back
to
the
wickiup
she
would
build
up
the
fire
and
dry
herself
off
its
heat
would
feel
so
good
she
hoped
eagle
feather
and
sun
woman
were
already
inside
she
stopped
before
the
silent
sitting
figure
outside
the
wickiup
the
brown
blanket
was
pulled
up
over
his
head
sun
woman
must
have
done
that
the
blanket
was
sodden
with
rain
and
he
looked
like
a
rock
growing
out
of
the
ground
the
beating
of
rain
filled
her
ears
she
squatted
down
and
looked
into
his
face
water
ran
in
rivulets
down
from
the
blanket
into
his
eyes
he
did
not
even
blink
she
shivered
the
cold
rain
was
coming
down
so
hard
she
could
not
see
most
of
the
camp
a
lump
blocked
her
throat
come
inside
she
said
she
had
to
raise
her
voice
to
hear
it
over
the
drumming
of
the
rain
white
bear
neither
spoke
nor
moved
come
in
it
is
raining
it
is
cold
you
will
die
out
here
she
realized
she
was
screaming
at
him
oh
she
cried
helplessly
she
sat
on
the
ground
looking
into
the
face
with
the
strong
nose
and
the
long
jaw
that
she
had
loved
long
ago
the
face
she
had
thought
about
so
many
times
and
had
seen
so
often
in
dreams
a
black
crust
of
blood
had
dried
over
the
place
where
her
rock
had
gashed
his
cheek
on
the
same
cheek
a
raised
white
line
ran
from
just
under
his
eye
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
to
try
to
wake
a
man
on
a
spirit
journey
could
be
dangerous
for
him
but
her
hands
seemed
to
have
a
will
of
their
own
she
had
to
touch
him
she
reached
out
clutching
his
shoulders
through
the
sopping
blanket
heedless
of
the
rain
pouring
down
her
own
face
running
under
the
collar
of
her
doeskin
shirt
down
her
back
and
chest
she
shook
him
get
up
come
in
out
of
the
rain
his
body
felt
lifeless
when
she
shook
him
but
did
she
see
a
flicker
in
his
eyes
please
white
bear
please
he
blinked
she
threw
her
arms
around
him
oh
white
bear
i
do
want
you
back
she
crawled
closer
to
him
pushing
her
body
against
his
rigid
form
she
felt
pressure
against
her
back
pulling
her
closer
to
him
his
hand
then
his
other
hand
she
felt
his
chest
rising
and
falling
against
hers
strong
arms
were
holding
her
she
looked
up
into
his
face
and
color
had
come
into
the
pale
cheeks
the
brown
eyes
were
looking
down
at
her
warm
with
love
she
forgot
the
rain
and
the
cold
and
nestled
in
his
arms
she
saw
tears
spill
out
of
his
eyes
mingling
with
the
rain
on
his
face
she
too
was
crying
she
had
been
crying
ever
since
she
sat
down
with
him
she
held
him
tight
looking
past
him
she
saw
in
the
doorway
of
the
wickiup
the
small
form
of
eagle
feather
staring
at
them
the
war
whoop
owl
carver
held
the
watch
up
by
its
chain
his
smile
of
approval
showed
he
lost
a
tooth
in
front
since
white
bear
left
with
star
arrow
a
handsome
gift
i
thank
you
for
it
but
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
it
tells
us
the
time
do
we
not
the
time
white
bear
scoured
his
brain
for
a
way
to
explain
sitting
close
to
the
old
shaman
white
bear
saw
that
age
had
bent
him
a
bit
more
and
carved
deeper
lines
in
his
brown
face
besides
the
necklace
white
bear
remembered
owl
carver
wore
a
new
necklace
made
of
tiny
beads
forming
a
red
yellow
blue
and
white
floral
design
from
which
hung
a
sunburst
pendant
they
sat
facing
each
other
in
front
of
the
shaman
wickiup
in
the
center
of
the
british
band
winter
camp
in
the
corral
dozens
of
horses
stamped
their
hooves
and
blew
steamy
breath
into
the
gray
sky
the
hunters
had
returned
with
braces
of
pheasant
and
geese
with
deer
slung
from
poles
with
buffalo
and
elk
carcasses
mounted
on
travois
dragging
behind
their
horses
white
bear
felt
his
nostrils
expand
to
take
in
the
smells
of
meats
being
roasted
and
stewed
in
a
few
days
all
the
chiefs
of
the
sauk
and
fox
along
with
representatives
of
the
winnebago
potawatomi
and
kickapoo
would
be
gathering
here
at
black
hawk
invitation
even
sooner
though
a
ceremony
would
take
place
that
meant
much
more
to
white
bear
tomorrow
night
he
and
redbird
would
at
last
be
married
and
he
had
come
to
redbird
father
today
to
give
him
the
only
present
he
had
to
offer
white
bear
pointed
to
the
dial
of
the
watch
father
of
my
bride
if
you
want
to
know
when
the
sun
will
rise
tomorrow
you
look
at
where
these
two
arrows
are
at
sunrise
today
when
they
are
in
the
same
place
again
it
will
be
half
the
time
till
the
next
sunrise
when
they
are
in
the
same
place
after
that
it
will
be
sunrise
the
next
day
he
faltered
to
himself
his
explanation
sounded
at
once
useless
and
ridiculously
complicated
almost
in
truth
the
sun
does
not
rise
at
the
same
time
every
day
he
finished
weakly
owl
carver
stared
at
him
as
if
he
had
uttered
nonsense
the
sun
rises
at
sunrise
he
remembered
how
frank
hopkins
always
reset
his
clock
at
sunset
yes
but
in
summer
the
days
are
long
and
in
winter
the
days
are
short
but
the
arrows
on
this
watch
can
not
keep
pace
with
the
sun
owl
carver
shook
his
head
many
things
the
pale
eyes
make
are
useful
but
i
do
not
understand
the
use
of
this
thing
a
struggle
white
bear
had
a
sudden
inspiration
it
is
true
this
watch
can
not
tell
you
as
much
as
the
sun
does
but
it
can
tell
you
one
thing
what
is
that
owl
carver
frowned
weighing
the
watch
in
his
hand
it
can
tell
you
when
a
pale
eyes
will
do
something
owl
carver
grunted
well
it
is
pretty
to
look
at
and
it
moves
and
makes
sounds
white
bear
snapped
open
the
back
of
the
case
where
the
key
was
kept
and
showed
owl
carver
how
to
wind
the
watch
impressing
on
him
the
need
to
handle
it
very
gently
then
the
shaman
went
into
his
wickiup
to
put
the
watch
in
his
medicine
bundle
white
bear
sighed
he
missed
talking
with
elysée
missed
the
library
at
victoire
from
which
he
managed
to
take
only
one
book
this
world
of
sky
and
trees
and
rivers
and
animals
is
a
library
too
owl
carver
knows
how
to
read
in
it
and
he
has
taught
the
old
shaman
came
out
with
a
pipe
he
filled
and
lit
it
with
a
twig
from
the
fire
in
his
wickiup
and
smoked
thoughtfully
for
a
while
before
speaking
white
bear
sensing
that
owl
carver
had
something
important
to
say
to
him
waited
quietly
we
need
to
know
more
about
the
pale
eyes
than
we
can
learn
from
that
owl
carver
said
we
need
to
know
what
they
will
do
if
we
cross
the
great
river
to
saukenuk
next
spring
white
bear
felt
his
heartbeat
quicken
is
that
what
black
hawk
plans
if
he
can
get
enough
sauk
and
fox
warriors
and
their
families
to
follow
him
at
the
council
all
the
chiefs
will
hear
black
hawk
the
winnebago
prophet
flying
cloud
is
coming
to
the
council
from
his
town
up
the
rock
river
he
will
add
his
voice
to
black
hawk
but
the
chiefs
will
also
hear
the
snake
voice
of
he
who
moves
alertly
he
spat
contemptuously
white
bear
knew
well
why
owl
carver
despised
he
who
moves
alertly
during
what
the
pale
eyes
called
the
war
of
while
black
hawk
and
his
warriors
were
away
fighting
on
the
british
side
the
civil
chiefs
had
appointed
he
who
moves
alertly
a
war
chief
in
case
the
americans
should
attack
the
sauk
towns
on
the
great
river
not
only
had
the
new
war
chief
never
fought
he
spoke
much
of
the
need
to
make
peace
with
the
americans
he
had
about
as
many
followers
among
the
sauk
and
fox
as
black
hawk
did
people
who
believed
that
the
tribes
would
fare
best
if
they
did
whatever
the
pale
eyes
demanded
after
the
war
he
who
moves
alertly
was
quick
to
make
himself
known
to
the
americans
as
a
friend
in
turn
the
long
knives
chiefs
showered
him
with
gifts
and
honors
even
taking
him
and
his
wives
to
washington
city
to
visit
the
great
father
james
monroe
he
had
in
fact
been
in
the
east
when
star
arrow
had
come
to
saukenuk
to
take
white
bear
to
victoire
why
does
he
who
moves
alertly
say
we
should
not
go
back
to
saukenuk
white
bear
asked
cautiously
he
did
not
want
to
anger
owl
carver
by
saying
so
but
he
himself
was
sure
that
crossing
the
great
river
could
only
lead
to
calamity
owl
carver
said
he
who
moves
alertly
has
always
been
a
friend
to
the
long
knives
and
they
treat
him
as
if
he
was
a
great
chief
and
give
presents
to
him
last
summer
when
we
went
to
plant
corn
at
saukenuk
he
went
among
black
hawk
followers
and
persuaded
many
of
them
to
flee
back
across
the
river
the
old
shaman
smiled
at
white
bear
but
now
we
have
you
who
have
also
been
east
and
know
the
ways
of
the
pale
eyes
you
will
be
able
to
answer
him
all
i
can
say
is
that
he
speaks
the
the
words
trembled
on
his
lips
long
knives
are
more
powerful
than
you
can
imagine
we
can
not
stand
against
and
yet
he
did
not
want
to
speak
he
feared
that
owl
carver
would
think
him
a
traitor
as
he
did
he
who
moves
alertly
and
in
a
way
he
felt
as
owl
carver
and
black
hawk
did
he
became
angry
every
time
he
thought
about
how
the
tribe
had
been
driven
from
its
homeland
owl
carver
puffed
on
his
pipe
you
will
answer
he
who
moves
alertly
not
just
as
one
who
has
been
among
the
pale
eyes
the
day
after
tomorrow
you
must
go
to
the
cave
of
the
ancestors
and
seek
another
vision
white
bear
heart
sank
but
i
am
to
marry
redbird
tomorrow
night
would
you
have
me
leave
her
the
next
day
to
seek
a
vision
owl
carver
spread
his
hands
the
council
starts
in
three
days
he
grinned
showing
the
space
where
the
tooth
had
been
and
it
is
not
as
if
you
and
redbird
have
never
known
the
joy
of
the
marriage
bed
white
bear
felt
his
face
grow
hot
and
he
lowered
his
eyes
since
his
return
they
had
tried
to
crowd
into
a
few
nights
all
the
pleasures
they
had
missed
over
the
last
six
years
you
will
not
be
gone
from
her
for
long
owl
carver
said
but
why
do
you
not
prophesy
white
bear
asked
you
have
been
the
shaman
since
long
before
i
was
born
owl
carver
nodded
sadly
i
have
tried
it
seems
the
spirits
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
because
you
do
not
want
to
hear
what
they
as
he
thought
about
seeking
a
vision
white
bear
began
to
feel
more
hopeful
he
might
not
have
to
displease
owl
carver
and
black
hawk
by
speaking
of
the
strength
of
the
long
knives
and
sounding
like
he
who
moves
alertly
instead
the
turtle
in
that
sacred
cave
looking
over
the
river
would
tell
him
what
he
should
say
it
was
sure
to
be
wiser
counsel
than
anything
he
could
think
of
himself
he
remembered
his
boyhood
dream
of
being
a
prophet
for
the
sauk
now
he
would
be
able
to
tell
them
where
their
future
lay
but
then
he
remembered
words
owl
carver
himself
had
once
spoken
to
him
they
had
stayed
in
his
memory
because
they
had
made
him
so
uneasy
times
the
people
do
not
want
to
listen
to
the
shaman
the
truer
his
words
the
less
they
hear
the
next
night
white
bear
and
redbird
sat
facing
each
other
on
opposite
sides
of
the
wedding
fire
before
owl
carver
wickiup
white
fringed
shirt
and
trousers
of
soft
doeskin
worked
until
it
was
nearly
white
were
a
gift
from
a
brave
whose
wife
sun
woman
had
helped
with
a
difficult
childbirth
redbird
dress
was
of
white
doeskin
as
well
around
her
neck
hung
the
necklace
of
the
small
striped
megis
shells
that
had
belonged
to
sun
woman
white
bear
looked
beyond
the
fire
hundreds
of
men
and
women
were
standing
in
the
shadows
watching
the
ceremony
those
of
redbird
eagle
clan
on
her
side
of
the
fire
the
thunder
clan
kin
of
sun
woman
and
himself
on
this
side
the
daughter
of
the
shaman
was
marrying
the
son
of
a
pale
eyes
father
and
a
medicine
woman
and
white
bear
had
returned
from
a
long
journey
among
the
pale
eyes
and
was
a
shaman
himself
it
was
a
wedding
that
people
wanted
to
see
wind
bends
grass
standing
behind
redbird
spoke
of
her
character
even
though
she
had
spent
all
of
her
life
scolding
her
tonight
she
extolled
her
to
the
skies
she
was
beautiful
loving
skilled
obedient
then
wind
bends
grass
instructed
redbird
in
her
wifely
duties
making
one
small
change
from
the
usual
speech
instead
of
telling
her
to
give
white
bear
sons
she
told
her
to
give
white
bear
sons
strangely
at
this
moment
white
bear
found
himself
thinking
of
nancy
hale
was
she
still
longing
for
him
somewhere
across
the
great
river
if
raoul
had
not
driven
him
out
of
victoire
his
promise
to
pierre
might
have
kept
him
there
he
might
never
have
come
back
here
not
found
out
till
much
later
that
he
had
a
son
never
have
been
united
with
redbird
as
he
was
tonight
truly
this
was
coming
home
he
felt
so
at
peace
he
could
almost
be
grateful
to
raoul
white
bear
was
especially
honored
to
have
as
his
wedding
sponsor
the
thunder
clan
most
prominent
member
black
hawk
himself
black
hawk
addressed
redbird
and
her
relatives
in
his
harsh
sombre
voice
i
have
known
this
young
man
since
he
was
born
his
father
star
arrow
was
a
pale
eyes
but
he
was
a
french
pale
eyes
and
the
french
were
always
the
best
friends
of
the
sauk
and
fox
even
better
than
the
british
white
bear
has
been
trained
in
the
way
of
the
shaman
and
he
has
lived
among
the
pale
eyes
and
learned
their
secrets
as
well
have
i
learned
that
my
people
can
really
use
white
bear
wondered
ruefully
i
can
tell
them
is
that
they
can
not
win
a
war
with
the
long
you
must
cherish
redbird
and
protect
her
black
hawk
said
to
white
bear
you
must
give
her
the
benefit
of
your
wisdom
because
you
yourself
are
a
shaman
your
responsibility
to
her
is
all
the
greater
then
owl
carver
stood
before
the
fire
between
the
bride
and
the
groom
and
raised
his
arms
o
earthmaker
bless
this
man
and
this
woman
may
they
walk
with
honor
on
the
path
they
follow
as
one
redbird
sang
a
wedding
song
to
white
bear
her
voice
rose
clear
and
pure
into
the
night
air
and
it
seemed
to
white
bear
that
even
the
crackling
fire
quieted
itself
to
listen
i
will
build
a
lodge
for
you
i
will
grind
the
corn
for
you
i
have
no
home
but
where
you
are
the
trail
you
walk
is
also
mine
then
white
bear
got
up
and
went
around
the
fire
to
redbird
he
handed
redbird
a
bouquet
of
pink
roses
that
sun
woman
had
carefully
collected
dried
and
preserved
the
orange
glow
of
the
fire
danced
in
her
black
eyes
and
white
bear
felt
an
answering
love
blaze
up
within
himself
he
was
so
much
taller
than
redbird
that
he
had
to
bend
his
knees
deeply
so
that
redbird
could
throw
her
braids
over
his
shoulders
and
he
heard
some
chuckles
and
giggles
from
the
watching
people
but
as
her
braids
fell
lightly
on
him
he
thought
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
happier
than
at
this
moment
together
they
walked
sunwise
around
the
marriage
fire
keeping
it
on
their
right
and
on
the
east
south
west
and
north
sides
white
bear
said
loudly
redbird
is
now
my
wife
eyes
gleamed
at
him
out
of
the
darkness
when
he
came
back
to
the
east
side
standing
to
the
side
and
just
a
little
behind
black
hawk
was
wolf
paw
white
bear
could
not
resist
feeling
a
little
thrill
of
triumph
at
the
realization
that
he
had
won
redbird
despite
the
best
efforts
of
this
mighty
warrior
this
chief
son
this
man
who
owned
many
horses
because
i
deserve
he
reminded
himself
because
redbird
would
have
it
now
because
she
would
have
it
so
we
will
be
together
owl
carver
bade
them
depart
with
the
good
wishes
of
the
tribe
and
white
bear
and
redbird
walked
to
the
new
wickiup
they
had
built
on
the
edge
of
the
camp
eagle
feather
would
live
there
with
them
but
tonight
eagle
feather
would
stay
with
his
grandmother
sun
woman
tonight
they
would
have
it
to
themselves
next
day
in
white
bear
stood
again
in
the
center
of
the
camp
wearing
the
same
black
bearskin
he
had
worn
six
years
ago
owl
carver
did
a
shuffling
sunwise
dance
around
him
shaking
a
gourd
rattle
and
chanting
go
forth
and
dance
with
the
spirits
become
a
spirit
yourself
bring
back
a
gift
for
the
people
bring
back
the
words
of
the
spirits
black
hawk
standing
in
the
circle
that
had
gathered
to
watch
stared
at
him
with
an
intensity
that
frightened
him
sun
woman
and
redbird
stood
with
smiles
of
quiet
pride
this
time
redbird
need
not
fear
that
he
would
freeze
to
death
on
his
spirit
journey
it
would
be
painful
to
be
away
from
redbird
he
thought
as
he
looked
into
her
eyes
saying
a
silent
now
after
a
brief
feast
of
love
they
must
go
hungry
again
but
only
for
a
night
or
two
white
bear
turned
his
back
on
the
declining
sun
the
ceremonial
bearskin
swung
heavily
on
his
head
and
shoulders
as
he
trotted
out
of
the
camp
toward
the
trail
that
ran
along
the
river
edge
as
he
entered
the
woods
another
pair
of
eyes
hostile
suspicious
caught
his
wolf
paw
again
standing
with
folded
arms
paw
still
loves
redbird
and
hates
he
felt
much
stronger
than
he
had
when
he
arrived
at
the
camp
alternately
walking
and
running
he
moved
quickly
and
surely
down
the
ioway
river
and
he
remembered
the
way
to
the
bluff
of
the
sacred
cave
several
times
along
the
way
he
met
sauk
and
fox
warriors
they
recognized
the
sacred
bearskin
with
the
bear
skull
covering
his
own
as
a
partial
mask
and
stepped
aside
with
eyes
averted
as
he
passed
them
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
him
by
the
time
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
trail
to
the
top
of
the
bluff
he
stood
there
a
moment
looking
out
across
the
clear
blue
sheet
of
water
that
was
the
great
river
he
stared
at
the
illinois
shore
the
rich
flat
bottomland
at
the
river
edge
the
wooded
bluffs
much
like
the
one
he
was
standing
on
forming
a
wall
beyond
which
rolled
the
endless
prairie
a
beautiful
and
fertile
land
from
which
his
people
and
he
himself
had
been
exiled
would
his
vision
show
them
a
way
back
he
scrambled
down
the
face
of
the
bluff
to
the
cave
and
swung
into
the
entrance
in
the
shadows
he
could
barely
make
out
owl
carver
wooden
owl
standing
over
the
row
of
skulls
with
their
stone
necklaces
or
the
white
bear
statue
guarding
the
unknown
depths
of
the
cave
he
settled
himself
facing
the
entrance
and
chewed
some
scraps
of
sacred
mushroom
owl
carver
had
given
him
nothing
to
do
now
but
sit
and
wait
surely
no
watch
made
by
pale
eyes
could
measure
the
passage
of
this
kind
of
time
he
heard
a
scraping
and
a
grumbling
from
deep
in
the
cave
he
felt
no
fear
now
only
a
warmth
as
at
the
approach
of
an
old
friend
the
white
bear
he
now
understood
was
himself
in
a
spirit
form
the
huge
snuffling
bear
was
at
his
side
and
confidently
he
rose
to
step
out
of
the
cave
the
bear
accompanying
him
with
its
rolling
walk
he
stepped
on
clouds
violet
and
gold
and
white
and
soft
as
snow
under
his
feet
the
pathway
through
the
sky
turned
northward
through
breaks
in
the
clouds
he
looked
down
and
caught
glimpses
of
the
river
a
glistening
blue
snake
ahead
he
could
see
clouds
piling
up
on
clouds
shot
through
with
pale
blended
rainbow
colors
like
the
ornaments
carved
from
shells
gathered
along
the
eastern
sea
then
he
was
inside
the
cloud
tower
peering
beyond
the
tree
of
life
at
the
turtle
on
his
crystal
perch
drop
by
drop
from
the
turtle
heart
flowed
the
waters
of
the
great
river
what
would
you
ask
me
white
bear
said
the
ancient
voice
like
distant
thunder
is
my
father
with
you
your
father
walks
the
trail
of
souls
far
in
the
west
said
the
turtle
he
will
come
back
to
earth
soon
and
he
will
be
a
great
teacher
of
the
people
owl
carver
and
black
hawk
have
sent
me
to
ask
should
the
british
band
go
back
to
saukenuk
the
wrinkled
voice
said
behold
the
clouds
changed
to
the
walls
of
a
room
big
enough
to
hold
a
sauk
camp
where
curtained
windows
alternated
with
mirrors
in
gilded
frames
under
each
mirror
was
a
fireplace
three
glittering
chandeliers
hung
from
the
high
ceiling
in
the
center
of
a
vast
carpet
stood
black
hawk
to
white
bear
astonishment
black
hawk
was
wearing
the
blue
uniform
of
a
long
knife
with
ropes
of
gold
on
his
arms
and
fringes
of
gold
on
his
sleeves
and
shoulders
but
he
carried
no
weapons
his
face
as
usual
was
gloomy
there
were
other
men
in
the
room
but
white
bear
could
only
clearly
see
one
a
pale
eyes
he
was
exceedingly
tall
and
thin
his
hair
was
white
and
his
bright
blue
eyes
stared
piercingly
at
black
hawk
he
wore
a
black
cutaway
jacket
and
tight
black
trousers
with
shiny
black
leather
shoes
and
a
white
stock
a
strip
of
silk
wound
around
his
throat
white
bear
had
seen
this
man
before
and
recognized
him
at
once
he
was
known
to
red
men
as
sharp
knife
andrew
jackson
president
of
the
united
states
the
man
raoul
had
called
a
good
old
indian
killer
black
hawk
was
talking
and
sharp
knife
was
listening
but
white
bear
could
not
hear
what
black
hawk
was
saying
the
room
seemed
to
change
black
hawk
and
sharp
knife
disappeared
and
where
sharp
knife
had
been
standing
there
was
now
another
tall
thin
man
he
also
wore
black
but
he
had
a
black
ribbon
at
his
neck
a
black
beard
covered
his
chin
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
one
of
inconsolable
grief
his
sadness
reminded
white
bear
of
black
hawk
all
at
once
white
bear
was
on
a
broad
field
covered
with
short
grass
divided
by
stone
walls
and
wooden
fences
with
clumps
of
trees
growing
here
and
there
terror
clutched
his
belly
as
he
saw
coming
at
him
thousands
of
long
knives
in
blue
uniforms
with
rifles
and
bayonets
he
looked
about
frantically
for
a
place
to
hide
but
there
was
none
he
was
caught
in
the
open
but
before
the
men
could
reach
him
they
began
to
die
blood
spurted
from
their
blue
tunics
they
stopped
running
staggered
and
fell
to
the
ground
dropping
their
rifles
faces
vanished
in
bursts
of
red
vapor
arms
and
legs
and
heads
flew
through
the
air
flashes
of
flame
and
smoke
and
flying
shards
of
iron
tore
bodies
to
bits
but
no
matter
how
many
of
them
died
more
and
more
of
the
white
men
in
their
blue
jackets
and
trousers
came
marching
over
the
horizon
holding
their
bayonets
before
them
there
was
no
end
to
them
white
bear
felt
as
if
his
heart
might
stop
he
put
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
when
he
looked
again
he
was
back
in
the
cloudy
hall
of
the
turtle
what
have
you
shown
me
he
asked
i
have
shown
you
the
future
of
both
the
red
people
and
the
white
people
on
this
island
between
two
oceans
the
turtle
rumbled
it
is
given
to
you
to
know
two
futures
because
two
streams
of
blood
flow
in
you
you
belong
to
both
and
to
neither
it
was
painful
to
hear
this
the
turtle
was
uttering
thoughts
that
had
occurred
to
white
bear
many
times
he
had
always
tried
to
put
them
out
of
his
mind
could
he
not
forget
his
years
among
the
pale
eyes
and
become
entirely
a
sauk
wisps
of
cloud
drifted
around
the
turtle
scaly
body
white
bear
heard
the
of
water
from
the
turtle
heart
into
the
pool
that
fed
the
great
river
the
sound
was
like
the
ringing
of
a
hammer
on
an
anvil
reverberating
through
the
vast
space
in
which
they
stood
the
turtle
spoke
again
earthmaker
has
willed
that
the
pale
eyes
shall
fill
this
world
of
ours
from
the
eastern
sea
to
the
western
sea
cried
white
bear
in
anguish
earthmaker
bestows
evil
as
well
as
good
on
his
children
sickness
and
hunger
and
death
come
from
earthmaker
just
as
strong
bodies
and
good
things
to
eat
and
love
will
all
earthmaker
red
children
die
great
numbers
will
die
and
those
who
remain
will
be
driven
to
unkind
lands
what
of
the
sauk
white
bear
asked
trembling
the
many
who
follow
black
hawk
across
the
great
river
will
be
few
when
they
cross
back
no
this
was
what
he
had
come
here
to
learn
but
hearing
it
was
like
being
cast
down
from
this
lodge
in
the
clouds
to
crash
to
the
earth
then
the
british
band
should
not
go
back
to
saukenuk
you
can
not
stop
them
for
you
as
for
all
of
my
people
this
is
to
be
a
time
of
testing
and
pain
i
charge
you
to
see
that
those
who
hurt
my
children
do
not
gain
from
it
you
will
be
the
guardian
of
the
land
that
has
been
placed
in
your
keeping
but
i
have
already
lost
that
land
white
bear
cried
as
if
he
had
not
heard
white
bear
the
turtle
said
know
that
long
after
all
who
live
now
have
walked
the
trail
of
souls
my
children
will
be
many
again
and
let
the
knowing
lift
up
your
heart
the
turtle
touched
his
own
claws
to
the
deep
crevice
in
his
from
which
the
water
perpetually
dripped
white
bear
knew
it
was
time
to
go
when
he
awoke
in
his
body
he
would
grieve
he
saw
nothing
but
heavy
unending
sorrow
ahead
for
him
and
for
those
he
loved
black
hawk
slowly
stood
up
a
mantle
of
buffalo
fur
draped
over
his
shoulders
and
a
crown
of
red
and
black
feathers
woven
into
his
scalplock
made
him
look
even
bigger
and
taller
than
he
was
white
bear
sat
close
to
the
fire
for
its
heat
the
day
was
cold
and
overcast
and
the
damp
air
around
him
and
the
chill
ground
under
him
made
him
shiver
in
the
white
doeskin
shirt
he
had
worn
for
his
wedding
because
owl
carver
had
asked
him
on
the
band
behalf
to
seek
a
vision
he
could
now
consider
himself
fully
a
shaman
he
had
costumed
himself
accordingly
three
red
streaks
painted
across
his
forehead
three
more
on
each
cheekbone
silver
disks
hanging
from
his
ears
a
necklace
of
megis
shells
around
his
neck
silver
clasps
on
his
arms
and
silver
bracelets
around
his
wrists
all
these
things
had
been
supplied
by
owl
carver
or
traded
for
by
sun
woman
if
he
had
to
speak
he
might
at
least
hope
his
words
would
be
greeted
with
respect
redbird
pressed
against
him
and
her
nearness
warmed
him
flames
danced
over
the
pile
of
blackened
logs
in
the
center
of
the
british
winter
camp
light
gray
smoke
rose
from
the
fire
the
same
color
as
the
blanket
of
cloud
that
hid
the
afternoon
sun
fear
twisted
its
knife
in
white
bear
stomach
he
did
not
want
to
tell
this
assembly
what
he
knew
most
of
them
would
hate
him
the
chiefs
and
braves
and
warriors
of
the
british
band
black
hawk
and
all
the
rest
would
never
forgive
him
owl
carver
would
feel
betrayed
them
settle
this
without
but
he
knew
it
was
a
forlorn
hope
when
owl
carver
had
asked
him
what
he
learned
in
his
vision
he
had
answered
evasively
and
now
owl
carver
was
counting
on
him
around
the
fire
sat
the
council
of
seven
chiefs
who
governed
the
sauk
and
fox
tribes
including
jumping
fish
broth
and
little
stabbing
chief
beside
them
sat
he
who
moves
alertly
the
friend
of
the
long
knives
the
war
chief
who
had
never
made
war
prominent
braves
like
wolf
paw
sat
with
them
the
older
and
the
younger
shamans
of
the
british
band
sat
there
owl
carver
and
white
bear
and
there
was
another
shaman
at
the
fire
as
well
flying
cloud
better
known
as
the
winnebago
prophet
he
was
a
broad
man
with
a
wolfskin
thrown
over
his
shoulders
unlike
nearly
all
the
men
of
the
tribes
that
lived
along
the
great
river
he
had
a
thick
black
mustache
that
drooped
over
the
corners
of
his
mouth
a
silver
nose
ring
rested
on
the
mustache
he
was
head
man
of
a
winnebago
village
called
prophet
town
a
day
journey
up
the
rock
river
from
saukenuk
in
the
quiet
that
greeted
black
hawk
white
bear
heard
over
the
crackle
of
the
fire
the
rattle
of
the
war
chief
bone
bracelets
as
he
held
out
his
hand
i
only
want
to
go
back
to
the
land
that
belongs
to
me
and
dwell
there
and
raise
corn
there
i
will
not
be
cheated
i
will
not
be
driven
out
black
hawk
did
not
have
a
pleasing
speaking
voice
it
was
hoarse
and
grating
but
the
assembly
listened
intently
because
for
over
twenty
summers
there
had
been
no
greater
warrior
among
the
sauk
and
fox
with
this
hand
i
have
killed
seventy
and
three
of
the
long
knives
every
sauk
and
fox
brave
every
winnebago
and
potawatomi
and
kickapoo
can
do
as
much
yes
we
know
the
long
knives
outnumber
us
but
we
can
show
them
that
if
they
want
to
steal
saukenuk
from
us
they
will
have
to
trade
too
many
of
their
young
men
lives
for
it
last
summer
the
long
knives
surrounded
us
and
drove
us
out
of
saukenuk
but
that
was
because
we
were
not
ready
to
fight
and
some
of
us
were
not
to
fight
black
hawk
looked
pointedly
at
he
who
moves
alertly
who
sat
expressionless
as
if
unaware
of
black
hawk
disapproving
gaze
his
face
was
round
and
ruddy
like
the
full
moon
when
it
first
appears
above
the
horizon
he
wore
his
glossy
black
hair
long
under
an
impressive
buffalo
headdress
with
gleaming
horns
and
had
wrapped
himself
in
a
robe
painted
with
sunbursts
black
hawk
said
next
summer
it
will
be
different
i
have
had
messages
from
the
winnebago
and
the
potawatomi
promising
to
help
us
if
the
long
knives
attack
us
the
chippewa
up
in
the
north
say
they
want
to
help
us
a
burning
log
split
in
two
with
a
noise
like
a
gunshot
and
the
halves
fell
deeper
into
the
fire
with
a
shower
of
sparks
looking
over
the
heads
of
those
seated
near
him
white
bear
saw
columns
of
smoke
from
a
dozen
or
more
other
campfires
rising
into
the
late
afternoon
sky
around
those
campfires
feasting
and
gossiping
sat
most
of
the
people
of
the
british
band
and
their
guests
from
other
sauk
and
fox
bands
as
well
as
some
winnebago
potawatomi
and
kickapoo
braves
what
was
being
decided
here
now
would
mean
life
or
death
to
all
who
chose
to
follow
these
leaders
black
hawk
said
the
pale
eyes
say
we
sold
our
land
i
say
that
land
can
not
be
sold
earthmaker
gives
land
to
those
who
need
it
to
live
on
to
grow
food
on
to
hunt
on
as
he
gives
us
air
and
water
the
land
has
been
good
to
us
it
has
given
us
game
and
fish
fruit
and
berries
it
has
let
us
grow
our
squash
beans
pumpkins
and
corn
on
it
and
bury
our
mothers
and
fathers
in
it
the
pale
eyes
are
destroying
the
land
cutting
down
the
trees
fencing
off
the
prairie
and
plowing
it
up
the
land
is
the
mother
of
us
all
when
a
man
mother
is
dishonored
he
must
fight
earthmaker
will
give
us
this
victory
because
he
is
our
father
and
he
loves
us
with
a
chill
that
did
not
come
from
the
air
white
bear
remembered
the
words
of
the
turtle
bestows
evil
as
well
as
good
on
his
white
bear
prayed
his
own
prayer
to
earthmaker
that
he
not
be
asked
to
speak
to
this
gathering
black
hawk
lifted
his
rasping
voice
in
a
shout
i
black
hawk
raise
the
war
whoop
he
threw
out
his
chest
lifted
his
head
and
let
loose
an
ululating
cry
that
seemed
to
pierce
the
very
clouds
that
hung
over
the
camp
wolf
paw
iron
knife
little
crow
three
horses
and
a
dozen
other
sauk
and
fox
braves
leaped
up
waving
rifles
tomahawks
bows
and
arrows
scalping
knives
screaming
their
battle
cries
owl
carver
beat
furiously
on
a
drum
painted
with
a
picture
of
the
hawk
spirit
the
winnebago
prophet
lunged
to
his
feet
and
joined
the
outcry
his
gestures
so
wild
and
his
shouts
so
loud
that
he
almost
seemed
to
be
competing
with
black
hawk
redbird
spoke
softly
close
by
white
bear
ear
they
are
drunk
on
war
the
outcry
died
down
black
hawk
crossed
his
arms
over
his
chest
to
show
that
he
had
finished
speaking
the
winnebago
prophet
remained
standing
and
raised
his
arms
i
have
come
to
promise
black
hawk
and
his
braves
that
if
he
goes
to
saukenuk
and
the
long
knives
attack
him
the
warriors
of
prophet
town
will
help
them
to
fight
back
the
chiefs
and
braves
seated
around
the
fire
greeted
this
with
much
stamping
and
clapping
white
bear
glanced
at
he
who
moves
alertly
who
sat
a
quarter
of
the
way
around
the
circle
from
him
the
face
under
the
buffalo
headdress
was
as
still
as
if
carved
from
wood
flying
cloud
said
i
have
sent
messages
to
all
the
tribes
that
live
near
the
great
river
winnebago
potawatomi
kickapoo
piankeshaw
chippewa
when
black
hawk
raises
the
tomahawk
they
will
raise
the
tomahawk
too
and
i
have
had
a
message
from
our
allies
of
old
the
british
in
canada
who
say
the
americans
have
done
us
a
great
wrong
and
we
should
not
give
up
any
more
land
to
them
if
american
long
knives
attack
us
the
british
long
knives
will
come
to
our
aid
with
ships
with
big
guns
with
rifles
powder
and
shot
and
food
for
us
with
hundreds
of
soldiers
now
is
the
best
of
times
to
tell
the
long
knives
they
can
not
push
us
any
further
let
all
who
are
truly
men
take
to
the
trail
of
war
with
black
hawk
white
bear
sensed
deadly
falsehood
in
the
words
of
the
winnebago
prophet
when
white
bear
was
in
new
york
city
he
had
heard
many
times
that
the
enmity
between
americans
and
british
was
a
thing
of
the
past
white
bear
did
not
believe
that
the
british
up
there
in
canada
had
any
intention
of
getting
into
a
war
between
whites
and
indians
in
illinois
but
how
could
he
prove
that
what
flying
cloud
said
was
untrue
with
a
cry
of
ei
ei
wolf
paw
shook
his
rifle
over
his
head
he
snapped
it
to
his
shoulder
and
fired
it
with
a
deafening
boom
and
a
red
flash
and
a
big
cloud
of
white
smoke
he
may
wish
he
had
not
wasted
that
as
white
bear
and
redbird
sat
silently
braves
all
around
them
were
up
and
shrieking
waving
rifles
and
tomahawks
thrusting
out
arms
and
legs
in
the
movements
of
a
war
dance
owl
carver
and
some
of
the
chiefs
slapped
the
palms
of
their
hands
against
the
taut
painted
deerskin
of
their
drumheads
a
few
other
men
did
not
join
the
shouts
of
approval
among
them
the
he
who
moves
alertly
white
bear
sat
with
his
fists
clenched
in
his
lap
wondering
whether
anyone
would
notice
that
the
youngest
of
the
three
shamans
among
them
was
not
shouting
for
war
he
felt
redbird
hand
grip
his
arm
tightly
helping
him
to
feel
stronger
only
to
redbird
had
white
bear
told
all
of
his
vision
she
shared
his
fear
that
if
the
british
band
followed
black
hawk
to
war
they
would
be
destroyed
and
she
had
insisted
on
sitting
with
him
at
the
council
fire
white
bear
knew
it
was
not
the
custom
for
a
wife
to
sit
with
her
husband
at
a
council
but
she
had
argued
and
pleaded
until
he
had
given
in
and
brought
her
with
him
her
presence
beside
him
both
comforted
him
and
made
him
uneasy
owl
carver
when
he
came
to
the
fire
had
stared
at
his
daughter
frowned
and
looked
away
wolf
paw
had
eyed
them
and
smiled
scornfully
as
the
tumult
inspired
by
the
winnebago
prophet
quieted
down
he
who
moves
alertly
looked
around
the
circle
of
chiefs
and
braves
his
eyes
pausing
at
anyone
who
had
not
joined
the
outcry
for
war
his
gaze
met
white
bear
for
an
instant
and
he
nodded
almost
imperceptibly
white
bear
had
an
eerie
feeling
that
he
who
moves
alertly
knew
what
was
in
his
mind
the
chief
who
favored
the
long
knives
stood
up
a
sullen
muttering
spread
through
the
men
around
the
council
fire
most
of
those
who
agreed
with
he
who
moves
alertly
had
stayed
away
from
this
council
white
bear
felt
admiration
for
anyone
who
could
look
so
confident
standing
before
a
crowd
in
which
so
many
were
against
him
war
is
loud
and
peace
is
quiet
he
who
moves
alertly
began
but
peace
keeps
us
alive
the
real
way
to
defeat
the
long
knives
is
to
stay
alive
his
voice
was
deep
and
pleasant
and
he
smiled
as
if
every
man
there
were
his
friend
when
is
it
right
for
a
brave
to
go
to
war
when
he
must
avenge
himself
on
those
who
have
done
wrong
to
him
black
hawk
says
we
should
fight
the
pale
eyes
because
they
have
stolen
land
from
us
but
i
have
seen
the
papers
with
the
marks
of
our
chiefs
on
them
seven
different
times
sauk
and
fox
chiefs
have
made
their
marks
on
papers
agreeing
to
give
up
all
claim
to
the
land
east
of
the
great
river
the
long
knives
say
our
chiefs
were
paid
in
gold
for
the
land
as
his
benign
gaze
swept
the
assembly
he
said
it
is
right
for
a
brave
to
go
to
war
when
he
is
strong
enough
to
make
war
he
does
not
go
because
he
wants
to
be
killed
because
he
wants
to
leave
his
women
and
children
unprotected
he
knows
he
may
die
but
he
does
not
look
for
death
he
who
moves
alertly
was
no
longer
smiling
he
touched
his
fingertips
to
his
eyes
then
raised
his
arms
to
the
sky
may
earthmaker
strike
me
blind
if
i
do
not
speak
the
truth
we
are
not
strong
enough
to
make
war
on
the
long
knives
i
have
traveled
in
the
lands
of
the
americans
all
the
way
to
the
eastern
sea
i
have
seen
so
many
long
knives
that
i
could
not
count
them
all
white
bear
felt
more
and
more
uneasy
as
he
listened
black
hawk
and
all
the
other
braves
of
the
british
band
looked
on
he
who
moves
alertly
as
an
enemy
but
white
bear
knew
that
the
chief
in
the
buffalo
headdress
was
speaking
the
truth
perhaps
not
about
the
treaties
but
surely
about
the
vast
numbers
of
long
knives
white
bear
saw
again
the
thousands
of
soldiers
he
had
seen
marching
in
new
york
on
the
fourth
of
july
a
year
ago
and
the
other
thousands
he
had
seen
in
his
vision
fighting
and
dying
but
still
advancing
on
some
strange
battlefield
he
who
moves
alertly
said
owl
carver
and
black
hawk
say
the
potawatomi
and
winnebago
will
aid
the
british
band
and
other
tribes
from
farther
away
i
say
none
of
them
will
help
this
quarrel
over
saukenuk
is
not
their
quarrel
and
they
have
made
their
own
peace
with
the
long
knives
the
winnebago
prophet
says
the
british
will
send
us
guns
and
ammunition
even
men
i
say
this
is
foolish
talk
you
call
yourselves
the
british
band
and
think
the
british
are
your
great
friends
many
summers
ago
yes
the
british
were
at
war
with
the
americans
and
got
sauk
and
fox
and
many
other
tribes
to
help
them
but
when
that
war
was
over
our
people
gained
nothing
and
lost
much
many
tribes
had
to
give
up
land
to
pay
for
fighting
on
the
british
side
now
the
british
do
not
care
about
us
the
british
pale
eyes
and
the
american
pale
eyes
are
at
peace
i
say
to
those
who
will
listen
to
me
come
with
me
i
will
lead
you
deep
into
this
ioway
country
where
there
will
be
no
pale
eyes
farmers
to
bother
us
their
great
father
will
show
his
gratitude
to
those
who
do
not
fight
them
he
will
give
us
money
and
food
and
help
us
find
good
land
we
will
live
for
those
who
follow
black
hawk
i
grieve
they
will
not
live
he
who
moves
alertly
closing
words
rang
he
crossed
his
hands
over
his
chest
and
sat
down
amidst
a
silence
touched
by
the
crackling
of
the
fire
white
bear
heard
in
his
mind
the
rumbling
voice
many
who
follow
black
hawk
across
the
great
river
will
be
few
when
they
cross
he
trembled
inwardly
the
clouds
overhead
had
broken
up
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
about
to
set
fell
upon
many
faces
full
of
anger
and
contempt
but
white
bear
also
saw
lips
pursed
in
thought
eyes
lowered
white
bear
could
find
little
wrong
with
what
he
who
moves
alertly
said
but
he
did
not
like
the
way
it
pointed
to
admit
that
the
long
knives
could
do
whatever
they
wanted
to
the
sauk
to
hope
like
little
children
that
if
they
obeyed
the
great
father
in
washington
city
he
would
be
kind
to
the
sauk
and
give
gifts
of
food
clothing
and
shelter
was
that
not
merely
a
slower
kind
of
death
he
who
moves
alertly
did
not
seem
to
see
that
if
the
sauk
let
the
whites
push
them
westward
there
would
be
no
end
to
it
eventually
the
pale
eyes
would
take
all
the
land
there
was
drive
a
people
from
their
home
is
to
make
them
prey
to
hunger
disease
enemy
tribes
it
is
to
destroy
them
even
if
not
a
single
shot
is
we
must
die
would
it
not
be
better
to
avenge
ourselves
on
the
pale
eyes
for
their
cruelty
to
us
is
it
not
better
to
die
with
pride
than
to
just
give
up
our
good
hunting
and
farming
lands
and
go
meekly
into
the
desert
he
felt
redbird
press
against
him
he
had
a
sudden
strong
feeling
that
they
should
follow
he
who
moves
alertly
farther
into
the
ioway
country
that
way
they
would
surely
live
how
could
he
white
bear
demand
or
permit
that
his
wife
and
son
endure
the
sufferings
and
the
danger
those
who
followed
black
hawk
would
face
but
at
the
thought
of
deserting
the
british
band
he
felt
an
unbearable
anguish
one
winter
long
ago
he
had
found
a
trap
that
had
been
sprung
in
the
trap
was
the
rear
paw
and
part
of
the
leg
of
a
raccoon
ending
in
a
bloody
mass
the
animal
had
chewed
its
own
leg
off
to
escape
he
had
seen
a
trail
of
blood
leading
into
the
woods
the
raccoon
had
limped
off
to
die
but
to
die
free
what
he
who
moves
alertly
offered
was
a
trap
what
black
hawk
offered
was
freedom
but
with
it
the
prospect
of
death
he
and
redbird
could
pack
their
belongings
and
leave
after
this
council
was
over
white
bear
was
sure
other
families
would
be
doing
that
but
could
he
turn
his
back
on
black
hawk
who
had
just
spoken
for
him
at
his
marriage
on
owl
carver
the
father
of
his
wife
on
sun
woman
who
he
was
sure
would
stay
with
the
british
band
on
the
people
who
had
been
part
of
his
life
as
far
back
as
he
could
remember
staying
meant
facing
the
long
knives
guns
it
meant
starvation
it
meant
pain
those
who
whooped
for
black
hawk
tonight
did
not
see
that
or
maybe
they
did
see
it
but
still
embraced
it
to
see
it
clearly
and
accept
it
not
only
for
himself
but
for
redbird
and
eagle
feather
hurt
like
biting
off
one
of
his
own
limbs
but
he
would
not
abandon
his
people
he
had
run
away
from
his
last
fight
over
land
he
would
not
run
away
from
this
one
owl
carver
holding
up
his
medicine
stick
with
its
red
feathers
stood
before
the
council
fire
he
who
moves
alertly
thinks
he
is
the
only
one
who
knows
the
americans
but
one
of
our
own
british
band
has
been
to
the
big
towns
in
the
east
and
he
is
a
shaman
to
whom
the
turtle
has
given
special
visions
i
ask
white
bear
to
tell
us
what
he
has
seen
at
the
sound
of
his
name
white
bear
felt
a
coldness
spread
upward
from
the
base
of
his
spine
he
saw
the
look
of
earnest
invitation
on
owl
carver
face
he
saw
black
hawk
expectancy
he
would
as
soon
spit
at
these
two
men
he
respected
so
much
as
disappoint
them
deeply
but
now
he
must
redbird
fingers
dug
into
his
arm
her
slanting
eyes
were
wide
speak
truly
she
whispered
slowly
he
stood
up
it
hurt
to
pull
his
arm
from
redbird
grip
as
if
he
was
stripping
his
own
skin
from
his
arm
his
eyes
momentarily
met
those
of
he
who
moves
alertly
who
stared
at
him
intently
as
owl
carver
had
he
raised
the
medicine
stick
he
had
cut
for
himself
after
his
first
vision
decorated
with
a
single
string
of
red
and
white
beads
he
held
it
up
uncertainly
he
hoped
his
shaman
adornments
the
paint
the
earrings
necklaces
and
bracelets
would
impress
them
he
was
prepared
in
another
way
as
well
he
had
never
spoken
before
the
leaders
of
his
band
but
at
george
school
each
boy
was
required
to
give
a
short
speech
to
the
members
of
his
class
once
a
week
and
a
longer
one
before
the
whole
school
twice
a
year
those
speeches
had
to
be
written
and
memorized
and
now
white
bear
must
speak
as
the
spirit
moved
him
but
he
knew
how
to
stand
how
to
project
his
voice
how
to
measure
his
words
in
his
heart
he
thanked
winans
for
teaching
him
all
that
the
big
american
towns
in
the
east
are
bigger
than
the
biggest
towns
ever
built
by
any
red
men
he
began
in
those
villages
the
pale
eyes
swarm
like
bees
in
a
honey
tree
every
summer
the
americans
have
a
great
feast
to
celebrate
the
day
they
told
the
great
father
of
the
british
that
they
would
no
longer
be
his
children
one
summer
in
a
big
town
called
new
york
i
saw
long
knives
walk
in
long
lines
to
honor
this
big
day
each
man
had
a
new
rifle
eight
at
a
time
walked
side
by
side
and
it
would
take
half
a
day
to
go
from
one
end
of
their
line
to
the
other
then
came
more
long
knives
on
horseback
as
many
as
a
herd
of
buffalo
and
after
them
horses
pulled
big
thunder
guns
on
wheels
that
shoot
iron
balls
the
size
of
a
head
the
long
knives
were
led
by
their
great
father
sharp
knife
who
was
visiting
new
york
he
is
very
thin
with
a
cruel
face
and
white
hair
he
sits
straight
on
his
horse
and
wears
a
long
knife
at
his
belt
after
all
those
long
knives
had
walked
through
the
town
they
came
to
an
open
field
where
they
fired
off
all
their
thunder
guns
the
noise
made
the
earth
tremble
allowing
his
legs
and
hands
to
shake
also
as
they
demanded
to
do
white
bear
paused
and
let
his
gaze
travel
over
the
faces
in
the
big
circle
around
the
fire
the
red
glow
of
the
setting
sun
fell
on
the
faintly
smiling
he
who
moves
alertly
black
hawk
back
was
to
the
sun
his
face
in
shadow
redbird
looked
up
at
white
bear
eyes
bright
and
full
of
love
others
might
hate
what
he
said
but
he
was
glad
that
redbird
heard
how
well
and
truly
he
spoke
angry
words
hissed
and
sputtered
like
the
burning
logs
white
bear
saw
wolf
paw
poke
little
crow
one
of
the
leading
braves
who
was
seated
beside
him
and
speak
to
him
with
muted
voice
but
urgent
gestures
the
brave
got
up
and
left
the
fire
owl
carver
seated
beside
black
hawk
lifted
his
head
white
bear
saw
bewilderment
on
his
teacher
face
and
shrank
within
himself
at
the
sight
owl
carver
said
white
bear
is
both
pale
eyes
and
sauk
so
far
he
speaks
to
us
only
with
the
pale
eyes
half
of
his
head
let
white
bear
tell
us
what
vision
the
turtle
has
given
him
white
bear
felt
a
small
surge
of
hope
what
he
had
seen
as
a
traveler
among
the
pale
eyes
might
not
discourage
the
british
band
from
making
war
but
his
vision
might
move
them
more
the
turtle
showed
me
black
hawk
talking
to
sharp
knife
he
said
pointing
to
the
war
chief
who
lifted
his
head
at
the
sound
of
his
name
they
were
in
the
house
of
the
great
father
of
the
americans
in
the
village
called
washington
city
he
heard
amazed
murmurings
all
around
him
encouraged
he
went
on
then
i
saw
great
numbers
of
long
knives
running
toward
me
over
a
field
they
were
shooting
and
being
shot
at
i
saw
many
of
them
hit
and
they
fell
and
died
but
they
kept
coming
on
i
saw
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
beard
a
sad
man
whom
i
have
never
seen
before
mourning
over
the
fallen
long
knives
the
sun
had
gone
down
now
he
could
see
the
dark
listening
faces
only
by
the
yellow
glow
of
the
fire
owl
carver
said
white
bear
vision
brings
us
hope
he
sees
our
own
black
hawk
meeting
with
sharp
knife
in
sharp
knife
house
black
hawk
will
go
to
sharp
knife
very
house
to
lay
down
peace
terms
to
the
americans
is
not
what
it
means
white
bear
thought
shocked
owl
carver
went
on
white
bear
saw
long
knives
dying
white
vision
foretells
victory
for
the
british
band
from
all
around
the
campfire
he
heard
grunts
of
approval
at
owl
words
white
bear
heart
felt
lost
and
sinking
like
a
stone
thrown
into
the
great
river
listen
he
cried
owl
carver
is
my
father
in
spirit
but
he
did
not
see
this
vision
or
feel
its
sadness
i
did
i
stood
there
before
the
turtle
and
i
know
that
what
he
showed
me
was
a
warning
if
the
british
band
takes
to
the
path
of
war
black
hawk
will
be
sharp
prisoner
shouts
of
protest
erupted
around
him
he
saw
little
crow
come
back
to
the
fire
with
a
bundle
of
bright
red
and
blue
cloth
in
his
hands
white
bear
spoke
on
over
the
outcry
listen
when
i
saw
the
long
knives
dying
more
and
more
of
them
came
forward
and
their
numbers
were
endless
they
were
not
fighting
our
warriors
they
were
fighting
other
long
knives
the
vision
said
that
there
would
be
many
many
long
knives
in
summers
and
winters
to
come
so
many
that
they
would
fight
each
other
owl
carver
said
in
a
voice
just
loud
enough
for
white
bear
to
hear
say
no
more
you
do
great
harm
i
must
say
more
you
have
asked
me
to
speak
now
i
must
tell
what
i
know
you
must
listen
the
turtle
also
spoke
to
me
he
said
many
who
follow
black
hawk
across
the
great
river
will
be
few
when
they
cross
back
after
a
moment
hesitation
owl
carver
lifted
his
hands
they
will
be
few
because
we
will
win
back
our
land
on
the
other
side
and
stay
there
before
white
bear
could
answer
black
hawk
stood
up
his
face
in
the
firelight
a
mask
of
wrath
white
bear
trembled
black
hawk
will
never
be
sharp
knife
prisoner
the
war
chief
roared
black
hawk
will
die
first
someone
else
was
standing
up
before
the
fire
a
woman
redbird
white
bear
felt
himself
trapped
in
a
nightmare
had
his
wife
gone
mad
she
could
not
speak
to
a
council
of
chiefs
and
braves
his
heart
beating
furiously
he
reached
out
to
silence
her
but
she
was
already
speaking
you
are
fools
if
you
do
not
listen
to
white
bear
she
cried
he
is
gifted
with
the
power
of
prophecy
she
turned
to
owl
carver
my
father
you
know
that
the
whole
tribe
crosses
the
river
from
east
to
west
every
year
for
the
winter
hunt
if
the
turtle
says
few
will
cross
back
over
the
great
river
he
means
the
rest
of
us
will
be
dead
her
words
were
greeted
not
with
anger
but
with
shouts
of
scornful
laughter
white
bear
knew
that
the
chiefs
and
braves
did
not
care
what
she
said
they
were
merely
amused
that
a
woman
dared
try
to
speak
to
them
at
all
he
burned
with
shame
for
himself
and
redbird
beyond
the
circle
of
firelight
he
saw
the
shadows
of
men
and
women
standing
in
the
twilight
word
of
the
dispute
at
the
council
fire
must
be
spreading
through
the
camp
and
drawing
more
people
to
hear
perhaps
to
speak
their
own
minds
as
was
their
right
he
glimpsed
sun
woman
hurrying
toward
him
picking
her
way
through
the
seated
men
wolf
paw
strode
toward
white
bear
holding
in
his
hands
the
bundle
of
red
and
blue
cloth
little
crow
had
brought
him
he
glared
at
redbird
it
is
bad
medicine
for
women
to
speak
to
the
council
redbird
stepped
in
front
of
white
bear
to
face
wolf
paw
a
medicine
woman
tells
you
the
words
of
white
bear
are
medicine
how
can
white
bear
tell
the
british
band
what
to
do
when
he
can
not
make
his
wife
behave
as
a
woman
should
wolf
paw
said
sit
down
redbird
and
he
pushed
her
aside
rage
shot
white
bear
forward
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
arms
outstretched
to
grapple
with
wolf
paw
he
lifted
his
medicine
stick
as
if
to
strike
at
the
brave
hands
gripped
his
arms
he
struggled
blind
with
fury
flailing
his
arms
and
kicking
wolf
paw
his
teeth
bared
wrenched
the
medicine
stick
from
white
bear
hand
do
not
harm
the
medicine
stick
shouted
owl
carver
without
looking
at
the
old
shaman
wolf
paw
handed
him
white
medicine
stick
two
big
warriors
held
white
bear
as
wolf
paw
approached
him
stretching
his
lips
in
a
grin
a
woman
speaks
for
peace
with
the
pale
eyes
wolf
paw
said
because
peace
is
women
way
i
once
saw
redbird
going
to
white
bear
when
he
was
on
his
vision
quest
maybe
he
gets
his
visions
from
her
more
and
more
men
were
on
their
feet
and
they
roared
with
laughter
at
wolf
paw
gibe
sun
woman
had
made
her
way
into
the
inner
ring
around
the
fire
and
now
held
redbird
come
away
daughter
she
said
in
a
strong
but
soothing
voice
this
does
not
help
white
bear
look
shouted
wolf
paw
now
he
has
both
his
wife
and
his
mother
at
the
council
fire
he
shook
out
the
red
and
blue
cloth
it
was
a
woman
dress
he
speaks
like
a
woman
wolf
paw
said
he
says
what
women
tell
him
to
say
women
speak
for
him
let
him
dress
like
a
woman
a
pale
eyes
woman
wolf
paw
flung
the
dress
over
white
bear
head
and
the
two
men
who
held
him
pulled
it
down
around
him
white
bear
felt
wrapped
in
hopelessness
as
the
cloth
covered
his
head
and
he
had
wanted
to
be
a
prophet
for
the
sauk
truer
his
words
the
less
they
hear
he
struggled
halfheartedly
he
no
longer
cared
what
they
did
to
him
his
own
failure
and
the
sure
destruction
of
his
people
chained
him
so
that
he
could
barely
move
the
warriors
pulled
the
dress
straight
down
over
his
arms
pinioning
them
to
his
sides
as
his
head
emerged
through
the
collar
laughter
battered
at
him
teeth
gleamed
in
the
firelight
he
saw
sun
woman
holding
redbird
tears
squeezed
through
his
tightly
shut
eyelids
the
face
of
his
mother
was
heavy
with
woe
too
despairing
to
resist
he
let
wolf
paw
and
his
men
push
and
drag
him
away
from
the
council
fire
and
run
him
through
the
camp
he
was
blind
to
the
laughing
faces
around
him
deaf
to
the
mocking
cries
but
he
saw
one
sight
that
all
but
killed
him
looking
up
at
him
from
somewhere
in
the
crowd
the
hurt
bewildered
eyes
of
his
son
eagle
feather
the
volunteers
nicole
and
frank
had
walked
halfway
across
the
main
room
of
the
trading
post
blockhouse
when
nicole
heard
raoul
voice
thundering
from
the
counting
office
in
the
far
corner
you
and
the
boys
will
stay
at
victoire
nicole
touched
frank
arm
and
they
stopped
and
drew
back
a
little
standing
beside
the
long
black
barrel
of
the
naval
cannon
raoul
had
set
up
in
the
blockhouse
it
would
be
best
not
to
intrude
on
raoul
when
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
quarrel
but
none
of
them
french
people
there
like
me
a
woman
answered
high
nasal
with
a
missouri
twang
it
downright
lonesome
nicole
recognized
clarissa
greenglove
voice
i
going
to
be
gone
and
your
father
coming
with
me
where
the
hell
else
would
you
stay
with
my
aunt
melinda
in
louis
that
be
a
perfect
place
you
could
send
me
down
on
the
of
course
i
could
raoul
voice
was
creamy
with
sarcasm
and
then
do
you
know
what
would
happen
half
those
men
who
are
out
in
the
courtyard
now
volunteering
for
my
militia
company
would
quit
because
if
i
send
you
and
phil
and
andy
away
it
means
families
are
safe
and
so
they
insist
on
staying
home
to
protect
them
his
voice
rose
to
a
shout
do
you
understand
now
goddamn
it
then
get
the
hell
out
of
here
a
moment
later
clarissa
scurried
out
past
the
door
of
raoul
counting
room
the
two
small
boys
she
borne
to
raoul
ran
beside
her
calico
skirt
she
gotten
to
be
nicole
saw
clarissa
nodded
mister
miz
hopkins
morning
clarissa
said
nicole
to
call
her
by
her
first
name
felt
not
quite
respectful
but
to
call
her
miss
greenglove
especially
with
her
two
sons
right
there
with
her
seemed
cruel
clarissa
gave
nicole
a
woebegone
look
that
seemed
to
be
asking
for
something
nicole
was
quite
sure
what
then
she
ducked
her
head
and
her
bonnet
hid
her
eyes
phil
the
looked
up
at
nicole
he
had
very
light
blond
hair
almost
silver
and
large
eyes
that
seemed
set
deep
in
his
pale
thin
face
a
little
ghost
my
dad
gon
na
fight
injuns
that
fine
nicole
did
know
what
else
to
say
clarissa
who
had
taken
a
few
steps
ahead
reached
back
and
jerked
phil
arm
so
hard
that
he
hollered
raoul
when
they
entered
his
office
seemed
unperturbed
by
his
argument
with
clarissa
but
his
eyes
widened
and
flashed
with
momentary
anger
when
he
saw
nicole
then
he
grinned
teeth
white
under
his
black
mustache
well
nicole
and
frank
come
to
lay
your
hatchets
to
rest
now
that
the
indians
are
waving
theirs
around
that
why
we
here
raoul
said
frank
yeah
i
read
your
paragraphs
in
the
said
raoul
one
side
of
his
mouth
twisted
up
in
a
contemptuous
smile
seems
you
just
love
to
give
illinois
back
to
the
indians
nothing
of
the
kind
frank
said
gruffly
how
unfair
nicole
thought
frank
had
written
only
that
if
the
land
agreement
had
been
obtained
through
fraud
it
would
be
better
to
negotiate
a
new
treaty
with
the
sauk
and
fox
rather
than
meet
them
with
armed
force
raoul
tanned
face
reddened
and
his
nostrils
flared
give
back
illinois
he
persisted
just
like
you
wanted
to
give
victoire
to
pierre
mongrel
bastard
nicole
saw
not
a
trace
of
guilt
on
that
broad
hard
face
over
what
he
had
done
to
auguste
she
clenched
her
fists
she
must
try
to
contain
her
anger
frank
spoke
do
bring
up
auguste
now
raoul
he
what
divides
us
and
we
ought
to
be
divided
now
we
want
to
talk
to
you
about
protecting
victor
heat
lightning
flickered
in
raoul
eyes
shifting
quickly
to
a
derisive
gleam
well
that
should
be
easy
frank
with
your
attitude
you
can
make
a
white
flag
out
of
any
bedsheet
nicole
thought
just
using
our
coming
here
as
an
opportunity
to
rub
our
faces
in
the
do
make
this
so
hard
for
us
raoul
she
said
we
need
each
other
really
what
do
i
need
you
for
his
eyes
were
cold
many
answers
crowded
nicole
mind
but
she
thought
for
a
moment
before
speaking
you
need
the
people
of
this
town
to
make
a
success
of
the
estate
now
you
taken
it
over
your
orchards
and
farms
your
shipping
line
your
trading
ventures
most
of
the
people
who
live
in
victor
work
for
you
directly
or
indirectly
and
you
leaving
them
unprotected
before
raoul
could
answer
frank
joined
in
from
what
i
seen
you
plan
to
march
every
man
who
knows
how
to
shoot
a
rifle
away
from
here
to
fight
the
indians
down
by
the
rock
river
if
you
take
all
the
fighting
men
away
who
going
to
defend
victor
and
victoire
raoul
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
with
laughter
god
i
believe
i
hearing
you
right
ever
since
last
fall
you
wished
i
would
disappear
from
the
face
of
the
earth
now
you
come
to
me
begging
for
protection
it
not
for
ourselves
that
we
asking
said
nicole
we
just
want
you
to
leave
enough
men
behind
to
defend
the
women
and
children
and
noncombatants
who
stay
here
raoul
eyes
narrowed
and
fixed
on
frank
noncombatants
like
you
frank
you
wo
pick
up
a
rifle
yourself
but
you
want
some
of
my
men
to
stay
and
guard
you
frank
looked
back
steadily
i
learning
to
shoot
your
father
is
teaching
me
nicole
felt
a
rush
of
love
for
frank
and
pride
in
his
willingness
to
learn
to
do
something
he
hated
because
he
had
to
raoul
spread
his
hands
good
for
you
and
good
for
papa
he
looked
down
and
his
face
reddened
slightly
when
he
looked
up
his
dark
eyes
met
nicole
how
is
papa
nicole
checked
the
urge
to
remind
him
that
he
had
nearly
killed
their
father
and
said
he
tolerably
well
the
little
house
frank
has
been
building
for
him
is
finished
and
he
able
to
walk
guichard
takes
care
of
him
raoul
clapped
his
hands
together
good
good
then
that
two
riflemen
you
got
right
there
and
i
bet
old
guichard
could
even
shoot
if
it
came
to
that
and
you
have
david
cooper
he
a
veteran
of
he
going
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
trading
post
for
me
along
with
burke
russell
i
sure
there
be
a
few
others
as
for
the
rest
of
the
men
if
i
did
lead
them
down
to
the
rock
river
they
go
anyway
raring
to
hunt
redskins
nicole
recalled
the
line
of
men
she
had
seen
just
now
in
the
trading
post
courtyard
signing
up
for
the
smith
county
volunteer
militia
there
must
have
been
over
a
hundred
of
them
some
wearing
coonskin
caps
and
fringed
buckskins
others
with
straw
hats
calico
shirts
and
pantaloons
two
dozen
or
so
sporting
the
head
kerchiefs
favored
by
men
of
french
descent
they
been
in
high
spirits
laughing
and
talking
about
bringing
back
scalps
frank
said
of
course
you
do
to
think
there
be
an
indian
attack
on
victor
while
you
gone
what
you
want
is
to
go
down
to
the
rock
river
country
with
the
militia
and
win
a
great
victory
over
the
indians
or
something
you
can
call
a
great
victory
raoul
held
out
his
hands
frank
you
printed
reynolds
proclamation
in
your
damned
paper
he
pointed
over
his
shoulder
where
a
copy
of
the
illinois
call
to
arms
cut
from
the
for
april
was
nailed
to
the
wall
nicole
eyes
traveled
over
the
opening
lines
fellow
citizens
your
country
requires
your
services
the
indians
have
assumed
a
hostile
attitude
and
have
invaded
the
state
in
violation
of
the
treaty
of
last
summer
the
british
band
of
sauks
and
other
hostile
indians
headed
by
black
hawk
are
in
possession
of
the
rock
river
country
to
the
great
terror
of
the
frontier
inhabitants
i
consider
the
settlers
on
the
frontiers
to
be
in
imminent
danger
raoul
said
he
does
say
stay
home
and
defend
your
town
he
says
rendezvous
at
beardstown
that
is
a
lot
closer
to
black
hawk
than
it
is
to
victor
frank
said
that
proclamation
is
for
towns
that
are
in
safe
territory
we
the
settlers
the
frontier
the
ones
reynolds
says
are
in
danger
i
was
talking
yesterday
to
a
man
from
galena
raoul
up
there
the
volunteers
have
formed
a
militia
company
but
they
going
to
stay
right
where
they
are
in
case
of
indian
attack
we
are
to
supply
troops
to
chase
black
hawk
raoul
shook
his
head
we
got
to
hit
black
hawk
hard
and
fast
with
all
the
men
we
can
muster
once
we
do
there
be
no
danger
to
victor
frank
said
if
something
like
what
happened
at
fort
dearborn
happens
here
at
victor
innocent
people
will
pay
for
your
decision
you
want
that
on
your
conscience
at
the
mention
of
fort
dearborn
raoul
face
had
gone
expressionless
he
sat
there
and
stared
at
frank
for
a
moment
then
stood
up
abruptly
my
conscience
is
clear
he
said
have
no
nicole
thought
she
stared
sadly
into
the
bright
blue
eyes
that
looked
so
blankly
at
her
now
and
wondered
where
her
smiling
little
brother
had
gone
so
many
years
ago
the
smile
still
came
readily
to
his
face
but
now
it
only
mocked
and
taunted
did
those
years
of
captivity
with
the
indians
fully
explain
raoul
or
was
he
a
throwback
to
some
ancestor
whose
only
law
was
the
sword
when
a
man
goes
off
to
war
miss
nancy
it
means
the
world
to
him
to
know
he
has
someone
to
come
home
to
raoul
smiled
down
from
his
chestnut
stallion
banner
at
nancy
hale
in
the
driver
seat
of
her
black
buggy
at
nineteen
she
was
a
woman
in
full
bloom
she
probably
have
married
a
long
time
ago
if
she
stayed
back
east
there
were
a
lot
of
men
out
here
on
the
frontier
but
few
good
enough
to
court
a
woman
like
her
be
a
fool
not
to
take
my
offer
seriously
it
the
best
one
she
ever
nancy
looked
first
at
the
dusty
road
over
the
hills
between
victoire
and
victor
the
morning
sun
beating
down
on
it
then
up
at
him
the
deep
blue
of
her
eyes
was
a
marvel
you
already
have
someone
to
come
home
to
de
marion
and
children
children
yes
but
the
mingling
of
his
de
marion
blood
with
the
nondescript
greenglove
line
could
hardly
produce
the
children
he
wanted
nancy
on
the
other
hand
from
an
old
new
england
family
that
probably
went
back
to
even
better
english
stock
was
just
the
sort
of
woman
he
wanted
to
breed
with
clarissa
and
i
have
never
stood
up
before
a
priest
or
a
minister
miss
hale
i
just
been
passing
my
time
with
her
until
the
right
lady
came
along
her
gaze
was
cool
and
level
as
far
as
i
concerned
you
as
good
as
married
and
you
have
no
right
to
be
talking
to
me
this
way
necessity
makes
your
bedfellows
out
here
on
the
frontier
not
mine
she
shook
her
head
blond
braids
swinging
he
could
picture
all
that
hair
spread
out
on
a
pillow
and
he
felt
a
pulse
beat
in
his
throat
nancy
went
on
you
must
know
how
wrong
it
is
for
you
to
speak
to
me
this
way
otherwise
you
would
have
ambushed
me
out
here
i
waited
days
for
a
chance
to
speak
to
you
in
private
josiah
hode
hodge
hode
boy
had
ridden
fast
to
the
trading
post
this
morning
to
tell
raoul
that
miss
hale
was
driving
her
buggy
into
town
and
was
traveling
for
once
without
her
father
it
was
the
news
raoul
had
been
hoping
for
ever
since
the
governor
proclamation
had
arrived
in
victor
knowing
miss
nancy
was
indignant
over
his
treatment
of
the
mongrel
raoul
had
delayed
approaching
her
now
he
could
delay
no
longer
i
leave
with
the
militia
next
monday
he
said
that
gives
you
three
days
to
think
it
over
i
hope
to
carry
your
favorable
answer
with
me
when
i
ride
off
to
defend
you
from
the
savages
she
smiled
but
the
smile
was
without
humor
or
warmth
carry
this
answer
with
you
if
you
wish
no
she
flicked
the
reins
and
her
dappled
gray
horse
speeded
up
to
a
trot
raoul
spurred
his
own
horse
to
keep
pace
with
her
take
time
to
consider
the
answer
will
always
be
no
anger
exploded
within
him
his
fists
clenched
on
reins
you
end
up
an
old
maid
schoolmarm
he
shouted
you
never
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
man
between
your
legs
her
face
went
white
he
had
hurt
her
and
that
made
him
feel
better
he
kicked
his
heels
hard
into
banner
sides
and
the
stallion
uttered
an
angry
whicker
and
broke
into
a
gallop
leaving
nancy
hale
and
her
buggy
enveloped
in
dust
he
wished
the
country
around
here
were
so
damned
open
if
he
could
have
dragged
her
out
of
that
buggy
and
into
the
woods
given
her
a
taste
of
the
real
thing
she
have
changed
her
mind
about
him
she
still
pining
for
the
mongrel
well
he
thought
as
the
gray
log
walls
of
the
trading
post
came
into
sight
around
a
bend
in
the
ridge
road
he
carry
her
answer
to
the
war
and
the
indians
would
suffer
the
more
for
it
prophet
town
was
deserted
black
hawk
and
his
allies
had
fled
raoul
reined
up
banner
in
the
very
center
of
the
rings
of
dark
silent
indian
houses
armand
perrault
levi
pope
hodge
hode
and
otto
wegner
stopped
beside
him
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
relieved
or
disappointed
his
pistol
drawn
the
hammer
pulled
back
he
drew
angry
breaths
and
glared
about
him
he
felt
exposed
realizing
that
at
any
time
an
arrow
aimed
at
his
heart
could
come
winging
out
of
one
of
those
long
bark
and
frame
winnebago
lodges
because
of
raoul
experience
in
the
skirmishing
around
saukenuk
last
year
general
henry
atkinson
had
commissioned
him
a
colonel
and
put
him
in
command
of
the
advance
guard
known
as
the
spy
battalion
he
enjoyed
the
prestige
of
leading
the
spies
but
he
felt
a
constant
tightness
in
his
belly
he
reached
down
for
the
canteen
in
the
indian
blanketwork
bag
strapped
to
his
saddle
uncorked
it
and
took
a
quick
swallow
of
old
kaintuck
it
went
down
hot
and
spread
warmth
from
his
stomach
through
his
whole
body
he
cooled
his
throat
with
water
from
a
second
canteen
for
three
weeks
now
slowed
by
heavy
spring
rains
that
swelled
creeks
to
nearly
impassable
torrents
the
militia
had
followed
black
hawk
trail
up
the
rock
river
to
the
whites
disappointment
the
indians
had
bypassed
saukenuk
doubtless
aware
that
the
militia
had
come
out
against
them
instead
black
hawk
band
had
trekked
miles
upriver
reportedly
stopping
at
prophet
town
now
they
were
not
here
either
raoul
hated
the
indian
village
on
sight
built
on
land
that
sloped
gently
down
to
the
south
bank
of
the
rock
river
it
surrounded
him
threatened
him
lay
dark
sullen
and
sinister
under
a
gray
sky
heavy
with
rain
it
reminded
him
too
vividly
of
the
redskin
villages
where
he
spent
those
two
worst
years
of
his
life
he
saw
no
cooking
fires
no
drying
meat
or
stacks
of
vegetables
by
the
dark
doorways
no
poles
flaunting
feathers
ribbons
and
enemy
scalps
that
characteristic
odor
of
indian
towns
a
mixture
of
tobacco
smoke
and
cooking
hominy
hung
in
the
air
but
was
very
faint
he
figured
the
indians
had
left
here
days
ago
otto
raoul
said
ride
back
to
general
atkinson
and
report
the
enemy
has
abandoned
prophet
town
wegner
gave
raoul
a
strenuous
prussian
salute
pulled
his
spotted
gray
horse
head
around
and
rode
off
the
two
hundred
men
of
the
spy
battalion
were
trickling
in
behind
raoul
hoofs
pattering
on
the
bare
earth
in
their
coonskin
caps
and
dusty
gray
shirts
and
buckskin
jackets
the
men
did
look
like
soldiers
but
they
had
taken
the
oath
and
were
under
military
discipline
till
their
term
of
enlistment
was
up
at
the
end
of
may
the
men
called
to
one
another
and
laughed
as
they
gazed
around
at
the
empty
lodges
they
were
enjoying
themselves
immensely
raoul
thought
this
time
of
year
most
of
them
would
be
breaking
their
backs
doing
spring
plowing
and
planting
now
they
could
earn
cents
a
day
while
going
on
something
like
an
extended
hunting
trip
men
would
rather
fight
than
work
any
eli
greenglove
on
a
brown
and
white
pony
trotted
up
beside
raoul
his
silver
lace
captain
stripes
glittered
on
the
upper
arms
of
the
blue
tunic
raoul
had
bought
for
him
a
long
cavalry
saber
hung
from
his
white
leather
belt
eli
grinned
and
raoul
had
to
look
away
it
seemed
that
every
other
tooth
in
eli
head
was
missing
and
the
ones
that
were
left
were
stained
brown
from
years
of
chewing
tobacco
and
now
clarissa
had
taken
up
pipe
smoking
making
it
even
harder
for
raoul
to
enjoy
bedding
down
with
her
only
nancy
but
nancy
had
made
it
plain
that
she
despised
him
damn
shame
of
course
old
eli
here
would
slit
his
throat
if
he
had
any
idea
what
raoul
was
thinking
eli
said
you
figger
the
prophet
town
injuns
have
joined
up
with
black
hawk
bunch
of
course
said
raoul
and
that
means
black
hawk
now
has
about
a
thousand
warriors
behind
him
a
movement
on
the
south
edge
of
the
village
in
the
surrounding
woods
caught
raoul
eyes
he
swung
around
in
that
direction
pointing
his
pistol
eli
get
your
rifle
ready
he
said
loaded
primed
said
greenglove
pulling
his
bright
new
cramer
percussion
lock
rifle
another
present
from
raoul
from
its
saddle
sling
controlling
his
pony
easily
with
his
knees
alone
indians
walked
out
of
the
woods
four
men
they
held
their
empty
hands
high
over
their
heads
and
shuffled
forward
slowly
watch
said
eli
they
may
just
be
trying
to
get
close
enough
to
jump
us
raoul
studied
the
four
advancing
men
two
had
their
heads
wrapped
in
turbans
one
red
one
blue
all
four
wore
fringed
buckskin
leggings
and
gray
flannel
shirts
he
saw
no
weapons
then
he
caught
sight
of
more
shadowy
figures
in
the
trees
beyond
the
indians
instantly
he
straighted
his
arm
in
that
direction
and
pulled
the
trigger
his
pistol
went
off
with
a
boom
puffing
out
a
cloud
of
gray
smoke
he
handed
it
to
armand
to
reload
it
while
he
reached
for
his
own
new
rifle
a
hall
the
indian
with
the
red
turban
was
shouting
something
raoul
recognized
the
language
potawatomi
the
sound
of
it
made
the
blood
pound
in
his
temples
those
are
only
squaws
and
papooses
the
indian
called
in
potawatomi
please
do
not
shoot
them
raoul
felt
like
shooting
them
all
just
for
being
potawatomi
but
he
held
the
impulse
in
check
he
had
to
find
out
whatever
they
could
tell
him
he
addressed
the
indians
in
their
language
indelibly
engraved
in
his
mind
by
the
acids
of
fear
and
hatred
tell
them
all
to
come
out
we
will
kill
anyone
who
hides
from
us
the
indian
called
over
his
shoulder
and
slowly
a
group
of
women
and
small
children
came
out
of
the
woods
raoul
took
his
reloaded
pistol
back
from
armand
and
walked
banner
over
to
the
little
group
they
started
to
lower
their
hands
keep
them
up
he
gestured
with
the
pistol
slowly
the
men
straightened
their
raised
arms
again
looking
at
one
another
unhappily
thought
we
welcome
them
with
kind
words
and
the
muscles
in
his
neck
and
shoulders
were
so
rigid
they
ached
and
his
stomach
was
boiling
in
his
mind
he
saw
again
the
scarred
face
of
black
salmon
the
brown
fist
raised
holding
a
horsewhip
to
beat
him
the
sounds
of
potawatomi
speech
brought
it
all
back
he
handed
his
horse
reins
to
armand
who
tied
banner
to
an
upright
post
in
front
of
a
nearby
lodge
who
are
you
raoul
demanded
i
am
little
foot
said
the
indian
wearing
the
red
turban
i
am
head
of
the
deer
clan
we
live
here
in
the
town
of
the
winnebago
prophet
little
foot
skin
was
dark
and
he
had
a
wide
flat
nose
he
wore
no
feathers
on
his
head
probably
not
wanting
to
look
warlike
black
hair
streaked
here
and
there
with
white
hung
down
from
under
his
turban
in
two
braids
to
his
shoulders
raoul
judged
him
to
be
in
his
fifties
could
have
been
at
fort
dearborn
twenty
years
one
thing
was
certain
little
foot
was
potawatomi
raoul
felt
his
fingers
tightening
on
his
pistol
as
he
held
it
at
waist
level
raoul
turned
to
levi
pope
and
some
of
his
other
smith
county
boys
who
were
seated
on
horses
nearby
tie
them
up
levi
who
wore
six
pistols
at
his
belt
all
primed
and
loaded
got
down
from
his
horse
and
unhooked
a
coiled
rope
from
his
saddle
the
squaws
and
little
ones
too
put
their
families
in
one
of
the
lodges
and
keep
a
guard
on
them
another
thought
occurred
to
him
eli
take
some
men
and
search
these
huts
make
sure
there
are
any
more
indians
hiding
out
somewhere
in
this
town
levi
went
to
the
indian
and
pulled
his
arms
down
roughly
to
his
sides
in
a
moment
he
had
little
foot
hands
securely
tied
behind
his
back
while
other
grinning
smith
county
boys
had
done
the
same
to
the
other
three
indian
men
ankles
too
said
raoul
and
levi
and
his
men
cut
lengths
of
rope
and
knelt
to
hobble
the
indians
with
his
free
hand
raoul
took
another
long
drink
from
the
whiskey
canteen
hanging
from
his
saddle
he
walked
close
to
little
foot
and
looked
him
in
the
eye
he
did
not
like
the
way
the
indian
looked
back
at
him
he
saw
no
fear
with
a
sudden
movement
he
hooked
his
boot
behind
the
indian
hobbled
ankles
and
pushed
him
hard
little
foot
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
on
his
back
wincing
with
the
unexpected
pain
as
he
pushed
himself
awkwardly
into
a
sitting
position
there
was
no
mistaking
the
hatred
in
the
way
he
looked
up
at
raoul
why
did
you
stay
here
raoul
asked
we
do
not
think
black
hawk
can
win
we
hope
the
long
knives
will
treat
kindly
those
who
do
not
make
war
on
them
raoul
said
where
has
black
hawk
gone
what
is
he
planning
where
are
the
people
who
were
living
in
this
town
i
promised
the
winnebago
prophet
i
would
say
nothing
about
where
they
went
i
will
be
accursed
if
i
break
my
promise
the
winnebago
prophet
curse
is
nothing
you
should
be
more
afraid
of
me
little
foot
remained
and
silent
what
a
pleasure
to
have
a
bunch
of
potawatomi
right
where
he
could
do
anything
he
wanted
to
them
a
light
rain
started
to
patter
down
on
the
bark
roofs
and
the
earth
while
raoul
had
been
talking
with
the
indians
more
militiamen
had
reached
prophet
town
columns
of
men
on
horseback
four
abreast
came
to
a
halt
in
the
grassland
to
the
south
of
the
village
and
fell
out
at
their
officers
commands
they
climbed
off
their
horses
and
walked
them
otto
wegner
rode
up
and
dismounted
general
atkinson
is
going
to
encamp
the
rest
of
the
army
outside
prophet
town
sir
he
said
giving
raoul
his
usual
vigorous
salute
nearly
dislodging
the
big
hunting
knife
sheathed
in
a
pocket
of
his
leather
shirt
raoul
returned
the
salute
carelessly
went
back
to
banner
and
took
another
swallow
from
the
whiskey
canteen
surprising
that
atkinson
should
decide
to
set
up
camp
here
when
the
day
was
only
half
over
well
henry
atkinson
had
a
reputation
for
going
slowly
raoul
had
heard
from
friends
among
the
regular
officers
that
atkinson
had
already
received
a
sharply
worded
letter
from
the
secretary
of
war
in
washington
city
reprimanding
him
for
not
moving
fast
enough
to
crush
the
indians
i
get
a
chance
to
take
a
crack
at
them
i
sure
as
hell
wo
be
the
early
arrivals
already
had
their
tents
up
officers
tents
were
of
white
canvas
six
feet
from
the
ground
to
their
peaked
tops
enlisted
men
set
up
pup
tents
just
large
enough
to
cover
two
men
lying
down
most
men
did
bother
to
carry
tents
and
slept
out
in
the
open
rolled
up
in
the
coarse
blankets
they
all
carried
men
were
wandering
through
prophet
town
peering
into
the
lodges
they
walked
with
slow
caution
rifles
ready
raoul
watched
justus
bennett
in
civilian
life
smith
county
land
commissioner
ordering
two
privates
in
buckskins
and
coonskin
caps
to
put
up
a
tent
for
him
bennett
was
always
trying
to
make
himself
as
comfortable
as
possible
his
packhorse
carried
his
tenting
a
big
bag
full
of
fancy
clothes
and
a
couple
of
heavy
law
books
why
on
earth
a
man
would
think
he
needed
such
things
in
the
wilderness
raoul
had
no
idea
bennett
raoul
called
take
charge
of
the
guard
on
those
indians
bennett
looked
annoyed
but
gave
some
final
instructions
to
the
men
putting
up
his
tent
and
slouched
over
to
the
four
indians
a
man
of
slight
build
he
looked
decidedly
unmilitary
but
he
explained
to
raoul
that
for
anyone
who
wanted
to
get
ahead
in
politics
a
war
record
would
be
a
godsend
raoul
called
out
levi
you
leave
off
guarding
the
indians
and
get
my
tent
up
a
crowd
of
men
had
gathered
in
a
circle
around
the
indians
maybe
they
wanted
to
give
the
redskins
a
few
licks
of
their
own
afternoon
colonel
raoul
was
used
to
looking
down
at
other
men
but
he
had
to
look
up
a
little
at
the
man
who
addressed
him
his
skinniness
was
like
in
a
way
but
this
man
was
a
heap
uglier
than
raoul
brother
had
been
he
looked
like
a
nag
bet
he
trips
all
over
himself
when
he
walks
and
when
he
rides
he
drags
his
feet
on
the
raoul
gestured
to
the
seated
potawatomi
you
boys
ever
see
indians
up
close
before
the
way
you
got
them
trussed
up
and
guarded
colonel
said
the
tall
man
i
say
they
must
be
pretty
desperate
characters
raoul
heard
the
smile
in
the
drawling
voice
and
felt
heat
rising
up
the
back
of
his
neck
he
took
a
closer
look
at
the
man
he
could
be
much
over
twenty
but
he
looked
a
twenty
a
farmer
face
darkened
by
the
sun
the
gray
eyes
set
in
deep
hollows
under
heavy
black
brows
crinkled
humorously
but
raoul
saw
cold
judgment
deeper
in
those
eyes
like
most
of
the
volunteers
the
tall
man
wore
civilian
clothes
his
were
gray
trousers
tucked
into
farmer
boots
and
a
gray
jacket
over
a
blue
calico
shirt
printed
with
white
flowers
an
officer
saber
hung
from
a
belt
around
his
waist
raoul
said
well
i
reckon
you
signed
up
with
the
militia
to
fight
indians
so
take
a
good
look
at
your
enemy
the
tall
man
walked
around
to
stand
in
front
of
little
foot
hunkered
down
and
said
howdy
little
foot
did
not
look
back
but
gazed
ahead
with
a
blank
face
the
lean
man
straightened
up
a
mighty
mean
customer
sir
some
of
the
other
men
in
the
ring
around
the
indians
chuckled
at
this
even
justus
bennett
snickered
raoul
was
feeling
angrier
and
angrier
he
had
looked
forward
to
questioning
little
foot
and
the
other
potawatomi
looked
forward
to
having
them
resist
and
to
breaking
their
resistance
down
with
fear
and
pain
he
even
hoped
they
might
give
him
reason
to
shoot
them
these
strange
militiamen
were
becoming
a
nuisance
you
seem
to
think
this
is
pretty
funny
who
the
hell
are
you
raoul
put
a
threat
into
his
voice
i
captain
lincoln
of
the
sangamon
county
company
sir
we
with
the
second
battalion
raoul
let
his
gaze
travel
over
the
other
sangamon
county
men
any
of
the
rest
of
you
able
to
talk
one
man
laughed
when
abe
around
we
mostly
let
him
do
the
talking
that
so
if
you
let
somebody
else
do
your
talking
for
you
he
may
talk
you
into
a
spot
you
wo
like
abe
said
oh
i
always
make
sure
i
say
what
the
men
want
said
sir
that
brought
another
laugh
raoul
anger
at
the
potawatomi
found
a
new
target
in
this
bony
volunteer
the
heat
of
the
whiskey
raced
through
his
bloodstream
there
was
one
simple
way
to
show
this
upstart
who
was
master
here
and
at
the
same
time
have
his
way
with
the
redskins
raoul
drew
his
pistol
and
hefted
it
in
his
hand
the
tall
captain
eyed
raoul
warily
and
said
nothing
raoul
said
i
going
to
give
this
potawatomi
one
more
chance
to
tell
me
now
where
black
hawk
went
and
if
he
disobeys
me
again
i
going
to
shoot
him
dead
he
stood
before
little
foot
and
pointed
the
pistol
at
his
head
in
potawatomi
he
said
tell
me
what
black
hawk
plans
to
do
is
he
lying
in
ambush
farther
up
the
trail
does
he
have
a
secret
camp
for
his
squaws
and
papooses
tell
me
or
i
will
shoot
you
swinging
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
to
the
man
in
the
blue
turban
beside
little
foot
he
said
and
then
i
will
ask
this
man
and
if
he
does
not
tell
me
i
will
kill
him
too
the
bony
young
man
said
with
all
due
respect
to
your
rank
and
experience
sir
i
must
say
that
what
you
propose
to
do
is
wrong
raoul
rage
threatened
to
boil
over
tension
jerked
his
right
arm
so
as
not
to
risk
wasting
a
shot
he
took
his
finger
off
the
trigger
in
a
mild
but
somehow
penetrating
voice
the
sangamon
man
said
tell
you
why
this
is
wrong
sir
if
you
allow
me
the
man
politeness
was
infuriating
raoul
turned
to
him
letting
the
pistol
fall
to
his
side
go
on
captain
preach
to
me
if
you
had
a
white
prisoner
at
your
mercy
you
would
not
shoot
him
because
he
refused
to
betray
his
comrades
you
would
think
it
honorable
in
him
to
answer
your
questions
with
silence
but
this
red
man
is
a
human
being
with
the
same
right
to
his
life
that
you
and
i
have
raoul
realized
all
at
once
that
the
lean
captain
backwoods
manner
of
speaking
had
fallen
away
like
an
unneeded
cloak
he
sounded
like
a
lawyer
or
a
minister
i
was
a
prisoner
of
the
potawatomi
for
two
years
i
can
tell
you
from
experience
they
not
human
at
all
how
angry
pierre
had
been
when
raoul
had
said
indians
were
animals
but
it
was
true
they
treated
you
badly
made
a
slave
of
you
damned
right
the
young
captain
looked
calmly
at
raoul
if
to
hold
slaves
and
treat
them
badly
marks
a
man
as
less
than
human
then
you
must
so
brand
every
wealthy
white
man
in
the
southern
states
a
few
of
the
men
standing
around
laughed
that
abe
got
an
answer
for
everything
again
raoul
hand
tightened
convulsively
on
the
pistol
grip
wasted
enough
words
on
this
walking
skeleton
from
sangamon
county
he
was
quivering
with
rage
there
was
one
quick
way
to
put
an
end
to
the
arguing
he
swung
around
and
stepped
close
to
little
foot
holding
his
pistol
less
than
a
foot
from
the
head
with
his
left
hand
he
pulled
the
hammer
back
to
then
full
the
double
click
sounded
loud
in
a
sudden
astonished
silence
and
little
foot
arms
unbound
shot
up
both
his
hands
gripped
the
barrel
of
the
pistol
and
yanked
it
to
one
side
about
to
pull
the
trigger
raoul
froze
his
finger
as
the
muzzle
was
pulled
aside
from
its
target
and
knew
with
a
sudden
sinking
of
his
heart
what
a
deadly
mistake
he
had
made
in
that
instant
the
potawatomi
powerful
grip
tore
the
pistol
from
his
fingers
should
have
fired
now
i
am
a
dead
raoul
saw
a
coil
of
rope
lying
on
the
ground
beside
little
foot
the
indian
must
have
been
working
his
wrists
loose
while
attention
was
on
the
argument
little
foot
had
already
turned
the
loaded
and
cocked
pistol
around
in
his
hands
and
pointed
it
at
raoul
heart
raoul
stared
into
black
eyes
that
had
no
mercy
for
him
a
blurred
figure
seemed
to
fly
across
raoul
vision
the
pistol
went
off
with
a
boom
coughing
blinded
raoul
saw
dimly
through
the
gunsmoke
that
the
skinny
captain
had
thrown
himself
at
little
foot
and
thrust
the
pistol
aside
now
lincoln
and
little
foot
were
wrestling
thrashing
about
like
two
wild
animals
by
the
time
the
smoke
had
cleared
the
lean
man
had
full
control
little
foot
ankles
raoul
saw
were
still
tied
and
lincoln
arms
had
snaked
up
under
the
indian
the
sangamon
county
man
big
hands
were
behind
little
foot
head
pushing
his
chin
down
into
his
chest
his
long
legs
were
wrapped
around
little
foot
middle
holding
him
in
a
crushing
scissors
grip
raoul
stood
shaking
his
eyes
watering
from
the
faceful
of
powder
smoke
he
taken
his
heart
was
pounding
frantically
against
his
breastbone
nicely
done
sir
justus
bennett
said
to
lincoln
what
the
hell
were
you
doing
raoul
thought
furious
at
bennett
with
a
trembling
hand
raoul
seized
bennett
pistol
the
four
guards
had
their
rifles
pointed
at
little
foot
any
one
of
them
could
have
saved
raoul
life
by
shooting
but
none
of
them
had
reacted
quickly
enough
only
lincoln
had
moved
in
time
the
lanky
captain
comrades
were
cheering
him
old
abe
the
best
wrassler
in
this
army
colonel
and
now
you
seen
it
for
yourself
raoul
wiped
his
eyes
and
shouted
stand
aside
lincoln
now
i
going
to
blow
this
redskin
brains
out
the
quaver
he
heard
in
his
own
voice
made
him
even
angrier
from
behind
little
foot
came
a
calm
response
i
going
to
ask
you
not
to
do
that
sir
he
tried
to
kill
me
get
up
and
stand
aside
god
damn
you
no
sir
lincoln
did
unwrap
his
arms
from
little
foot
head
and
shoulders
but
still
held
him
with
his
legs
the
indian
sat
motionless
as
if
his
effort
to
kill
raoul
had
taken
the
last
of
his
strength
he
muttered
under
his
breath
probably
his
death
song
raoul
thought
lincoln
quickly
retied
the
indian
then
stood
up
placing
himself
between
raoul
and
little
foot
he
held
raoul
empty
pistol
out
to
him
butt
first
colonel
i
believe
you
a
fair
man
and
you
agree
that
i
just
saved
your
life
raoul
took
his
pistol
and
handed
it
to
armand
realizing
that
the
tall
man
was
maneuvering
him
into
a
difficult
position
too
many
men
had
seen
what
happened
yes
you
did
save
my
life
the
words
hurt
his
throat
same
as
if
that
pistol
ball
had
hit
him
and
lodged
there
and
i
thank
you
you
have
my
most
profound
gratitude
that
being
so
and
since
i
have
done
you
what
you
might
think
a
favor
will
you
grant
me
a
life
for
a
life
for
a
moment
raoul
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
or
do
all
he
had
to
do
was
shove
this
lincoln
aside
put
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
to
little
foot
head
and
pull
the
trigger
he
realized
too
that
the
longer
he
hesitated
the
more
a
fool
he
looked
what
right
did
the
skinny
captain
have
to
demand
that
he
spare
little
foot
raoul
became
aware
that
the
crowd
around
them
had
grown
to
perhaps
a
couple
of
hundred
men
the
ones
he
could
see
wore
little
half
smiles
whoever
came
out
the
winner
they
were
having
a
fine
old
time
watching
raoul
was
broader
and
maybe
stronger
than
lincoln
but
how
ridiculous
he
would
look
if
he
had
to
fight
the
man
to
get
past
him
to
shoot
little
foot
and
what
if
this
bag
of
bones
beat
him
abe
the
best
wrassler
in
this
army
the
truth
was
bitter
as
vinegar
but
the
only
course
that
would
preserve
his
dignity
would
be
to
let
lincoln
have
his
way
ah
hell
he
said
loudly
and
was
pleased
to
hear
that
while
stood
silently
thinking
his
voice
had
regained
its
strength
sure
i
let
the
indian
live
he
nothing
to
me
he
noticed
that
his
hand
still
shook
a
little
as
he
gave
pistol
back
to
him
he
took
his
own
reloaded
from
armand
and
holstered
it
hoping
no
one
could
see
his
tremor
my
hand
on
it
he
said
holding
out
his
right
hand
willing
it
to
be
steady
the
grip
that
met
his
was
crushing
even
though
he
seen
the
bony
young
man
immobilize
little
foot
raoul
was
surprised
he
felt
the
men
would
expect
him
to
do
more
to
show
his
gratitude
come
and
have
a
drink
with
me
abe
my
pleasure
sir
armand
had
finished
putting
raoul
tent
up
in
the
tent
armand
uncorked
a
jug
and
handed
it
to
raoul
who
offered
it
to
lincoln
the
young
man
hooked
his
finger
in
the
ring
at
the
neck
of
the
jug
and
raised
it
to
his
mouth
raoul
watched
the
prominent
adam
apple
rise
and
fall
as
he
took
a
long
swallow
i
normally
do
touch
whiskey
sir
lincoln
said
handing
the
jug
back
to
raoul
i
seen
it
ruin
too
many
good
men
but
i
do
appreciate
this
it
not
every
day
i
grab
a
pistol
as
it
goes
off
wrestle
an
indian
and
disobey
a
colonel
well
that
the
best
whiskey
there
is
old
kaintuck
three
things
kentucky
makes
better
than
anyplace
else
said
lincoln
quilts
rifles
and
whiskey
i
should
know
that
where
i
hail
from
it
was
because
of
men
like
this
raoul
thought
with
some
disdain
that
illinoisians
got
their
nickname
suckers
the
weak
shoots
of
the
tobacco
plant
that
had
to
be
stripped
off
and
thrown
away
were
called
suckers
and
illinois
was
said
to
be
largely
populated
by
emigrants
from
states
like
kentucky
then
here
to
kentucky
said
raoul
loathing
the
tall
ugly
man
for
spoiling
his
revenge
he
lifted
the
jug
to
his
lips
and
let
the
burning
liquid
roll
over
his
tongue
and
slide
down
his
throat
grateful
to
it
for
the
warmth
that
would
melt
away
the
chill
of
death
he
still
felt
around
his
heart
a
few
more
swigs
and
raoul
found
himself
wanting
to
bring
lincoln
around
to
his
way
of
thinking
the
man
after
all
saved
his
life
you
know
you
went
to
a
whole
lot
of
bother
over
that
indian
now
he
said
it
a
waste
of
time
we
only
going
to
have
to
kill
them
all
later
anyway
lincoln
winced
as
if
raoul
words
had
hurt
him
why
do
you
say
that
sir
i
got
a
big
estate
in
smith
county
beside
the
mississippi
miles
and
miles
of
wonderful
fertile
land
just
begging
for
the
plow
and
too
much
of
it
is
growing
nothing
but
prairie
flowers
because
i
ca
get
enough
people
to
come
and
work
it
for
me
they
afraid
of
indians
treat
the
indians
fairly
and
there
would
be
nothing
to
fear
said
lincoln
treat
them
fairly
and
they
just
continue
to
attack
our
settlements
i
like
to
think
you
wrong
de
marion
why
the
hell
did
you
volunteer
for
the
militia
if
you
do
like
killing
indians
lincoln
smiled
faintly
well
a
war
record
wo
hurt
when
i
make
a
run
for
the
legislature
just
another
slimy
politician
same
as
bennett
a
bluebelly
a
officer
of
the
federal
army
pushed
through
the
tent
flap
he
doffed
his
tall
cylindrical
shako
general
atkinson
compliments
colonel
de
marion
we
breaking
camp
and
moving
on
up
the
rock
river
in
pursuit
of
black
hawk
and
his
band
and
he
asks
you
to
once
again
take
up
the
lead
position
how
does
the
general
know
where
the
sauk
are
he
asked
irritably
a
couple
of
winnebago
known
to
the
general
came
into
camp
and
offered
to
guide
us
sir
they
say
black
hawk
and
the
winnebago
prophet
are
leading
their
people
upriver
to
try
to
persuade
the
potawatomi
to
join
them
black
hawk
whole
band
except
for
the
warriors
are
on
foot
the
general
thinks
that
if
we
ride
hard
we
can
catch
them
lincoln
held
out
his
hand
and
shook
again
with
raoul
thank
you
for
the
whiskey
sir
thank
you
for
turning
that
pistol
aside
lincoln
grinned
colonel
thank
for
sparing
that
red
man
i
be
going
now
or
by
the
time
we
finish
thanking
each
other
black
hawk
will
be
in
checagou
when
raoul
emerged
from
his
tent
he
saw
that
the
potawatomi
prisoners
were
gone
he
felt
a
surge
of
fury
that
someone
had
turned
them
loose
without
his
permission
he
still
longed
to
put
a
ball
into
the
skull
of
that
sneaking
little
foot
next
indian
who
falls
into
my
hands
wo
be
so
by
the
time
the
men
of
his
spy
battalion
had
struck
their
tents
and
mounted
up
he
had
decided
on
half
a
loaf
of
revenge
seated
on
banner
he
held
up
a
burning
stick
all
right
men
the
winnebago
who
lived
here
have
joined
up
with
black
hawk
they
running
ahead
of
us
let
not
leave
them
anything
to
come
back
to
he
drew
his
arm
back
and
snapped
it
forward
the
torch
flew
end
over
end
and
landed
on
the
bark
roof
of
the
nearest
winnebago
lodge
a
circle
of
orange
flame
spread
out
quickly
it
was
still
raining
but
not
enough
to
slow
the
fire
down
much
raoul
men
whooped
eli
and
armand
led
the
way
in
hurling
flaming
sticks
into
the
dark
brown
indian
huts
armand
grinning
handed
raoul
a
long
pole
he
pulled
loose
from
the
wall
of
a
lodge
afire
at
one
end
waving
his
hat
raoul
rode
through
the
town
touching
the
burning
pole
to
the
flimsy
wall
of
each
lodge
he
passed
the
men
of
the
battalion
scattered
setting
fires
everywhere
beyond
the
town
the
remaining
militiamen
stopped
breaking
camp
to
watch
soon
the
roar
of
the
burning
lodges
thundered
in
raoul
ears
like
a
big
waterfall
if
they
could
catch
black
hawk
he
thought
what
glory
that
would
be
no
matter
how
many
fighting
men
black
hawk
had
raoul
felt
sure
his
battalion
could
crush
them
the
burning
lodges
the
whiskey
in
his
blood
the
hatred
in
his
heart
all
ran
together
so
that
raoul
felt
like
a
prairie
fire
racing
after
the
british
band
first
blood
white
bear
tried
to
think
only
about
guiding
his
white
pony
over
the
grasslands
and
watching
his
two
companions
he
tried
to
put
fear
out
of
his
mind
did
not
even
have
a
chance
to
say
to
redbird
was
a
day
ride
up
the
rock
river
from
here
at
the
camp
the
potawatomi
had
allowed
black
hawk
people
to
set
up
white
bear
body
went
cold
with
the
thought
that
he
might
be
killed
today
and
she
be
left
alone
and
pursued
by
enemies
should
have
asked
wolf
paw
to
be
her
protector
if
i
die
he
hates
me
but
he
cares
for
it
was
for
redbird
and
eagle
feather
and
for
the
baby
growing
inside
redbird
that
he
was
risking
his
life
today
his
family
was
going
hungry
it
had
been
over
six
weeks
by
pale
eyes
reckoning
since
black
hawk
had
led
them
across
the
great
river
into
illinois
white
bear
and
redbird
like
other
british
band
families
could
carry
little
food
with
them
and
most
of
that
was
gone
with
the
long
knives
pressing
behind
them
white
bear
had
no
time
to
hunt
or
fish
nor
redbird
to
gather
food
from
the
woodlands
she
must
not
go
without
food
especially
not
while
carrying
their
child
the
children
of
the
british
band
walked
about
the
crying
of
hungry
babies
rose
from
every
part
of
the
camp
old
people
looking
nearly
dead
lay
on
the
ground
trying
to
husband
their
strength
at
a
secret
meeting
last
night
the
potawatomi
chiefs
despite
flying
cloud
prophecy
had
refused
to
join
black
hawk
in
fighting
the
long
knives
or
even
to
give
his
people
supplies
or
let
them
remain
long
in
potawatomi
territory
black
hawk
himself
had
been
forced
to
admit
that
the
only
way
to
spare
the
band
further
hardship
would
be
to
go
quietly
back
across
the
great
river
to
do
that
he
had
to
make
peace
with
the
long
knives
frightened
though
he
was
white
bear
as
the
only
member
of
the
tribe
who
spoke
fluent
english
felt
he
must
go
with
black
hawk
emissaries
white
bear
shoulders
slumped
in
discouragement
as
he
thought
how
black
hawk
and
the
rest
of
the
band
had
been
led
astray
other
tribes
were
willing
to
ally
themselves
with
the
british
band
there
had
been
truth
at
all
to
the
winnebago
prophet
talk
of
aid
from
the
british
in
canada
a
delegation
headed
by
broth
the
tribe
best
speaker
had
gone
to
the
british
fort
at
malden
near
detroit
to
ask
for
help
they
had
been
sent
back
with
the
advice
that
the
sauk
had
better
learn
to
live
in
peace
with
the
americans
the
people
of
prophet
town
had
left
their
homes
with
black
hawk
band
more
out
of
fear
of
the
oncoming
long
knives
than
out
of
a
desire
to
help
black
hawk
fight
for
saukenuk
as
black
hawk
prospects
worsened
most
of
them
drifted
away
even
though
the
prophet
himself
remained
at
black
hawk
side
black
hawk
had
believed
the
prophet
because
his
promises
gave
the
british
band
the
courage
to
defy
the
long
knives
to
white
disgust
even
now
when
it
was
clear
that
flying
cloud
had
simply
made
it
all
up
black
hawk
had
forgiven
the
prophet
white
bear
burned
with
resentment
mocked
me
when
i
told
them
the
truth
that
fat
posturing
toad
lied
to
them
and
they
still
honor
him
surely
a
false
shaman
is
the
worst
kind
of
white
bear
rode
on
little
crow
right
as
the
oldest
of
the
three
men
little
crow
carried
the
white
flag
torn
from
a
sheet
the
braves
had
found
in
a
settler
hastily
abandoned
cabin
the
flag
was
tied
to
a
spear
shaft
from
which
the
head
had
been
removed
on
little
crow
left
rode
three
horses
since
they
were
not
riding
into
battle
they
had
not
taken
any
of
the
saddles
with
stirrups
from
the
band
supply
but
were
mounted
with
only
blankets
between
themselves
and
the
horses
backs
the
three
of
them
had
painted
their
faces
black
because
they
might
be
going
to
their
deaths
but
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
men
might
be
killed
on
this
beautiful
afternoon
in
the
middle
of
the
moon
of
buds
a
warm
breeze
blew
over
white
bear
bare
chest
and
arms
red
blue
and
yellow
prairie
flowers
scattered
over
the
land
as
uncountable
as
the
stars
delighted
his
eye
in
spite
of
his
fear
all
around
him
he
heard
blackbirds
singing
their
spring
challenges
white
bear
had
left
with
owl
carver
everything
he
valued
his
medicine
stick
his
sauk
medicine
bag
and
his
other
bag
of
pale
eyes
medical
instruments
his
necklace
his
brass
and
silver
ornaments
his
the
knife
his
father
had
long
ago
given
him
he
had
nothing
with
him
but
the
clothing
he
wore
fringed
buckskin
leggings
and
a
buckskin
vest
decorated
with
blue
and
green
quillwork
in
diamond
patterns
he
looked
back
and
saw
five
mounted
braves
an
arrow
flight
behind
him
on
the
prairie
even
from
this
distance
he
could
tell
that
the
tall
one
in
the
middle
was
iron
knife
they
would
watch
from
hiding
and
would
report
back
to
black
hawk
how
the
long
knives
treated
his
peace
messengers
black
hawk
himself
with
owl
carver
the
winnebago
prophet
wolf
paw
and
about
forty
braves
waited
a
few
miles
farther
up
the
rock
river
at
the
place
where
he
had
met
with
the
potawatomi
chiefs
white
bear
saw
a
small
stand
of
woods
ahead
scouts
had
reported
that
beyond
those
woods
across
old
man
creek
the
long
knives
had
set
up
camp
glowing
from
behind
young
green
leaves
set
aflutter
by
the
breeze
the
setting
sun
dropped
flecks
of
gold
onto
the
blackened
faces
of
white
bear
two
companions
it
would
be
almost
nightfall
by
the
time
they
encountered
the
long
knives
three
horses
said
a
man
must
be
more
brave
i
think
to
do
this
than
to
ride
up
to
an
enemy
in
battle
and
strike
the
first
blow
at
him
his
nose
curved
inward
where
the
bridge
should
have
been
white
bear
had
learned
that
a
sioux
war
club
had
done
that
to
him
while
auguste
was
studying
latin
and
geometry
at
george
school
i
would
much
rather
be
fighting
the
long
knives
than
trying
to
make
peace
with
them
said
little
crow
i
do
not
trust
them
white
bear
tried
to
reassure
them
and
himself
we
must
do
this
it
is
the
only
way
we
can
get
our
people
safely
back
across
the
great
river
little
crow
said
it
seems
you
were
right
and
we
who
wanted
to
take
up
the
tomahawk
were
wrong
in
spite
of
his
fear
white
bear
felt
a
satisfied
glow
at
little
words
little
crow
had
been
the
one
who
brought
the
woman
dress
that
wolf
paw
had
put
on
him
that
wretched
night
of
the
council
did
not
listen
to
me
that
night
the
turtle
told
me
i
would
not
be
able
to
persuade
the
people
not
to
cross
the
great
river
but
i
tried
my
they
entered
the
wood
by
way
of
a
narrow
trail
riding
single
file
little
crow
lowered
the
white
flag
to
keep
it
from
getting
caught
in
the
branches
as
they
rode
among
the
trees
the
tightness
of
fear
in
white
chest
and
stomach
grew
worse
until
he
had
to
struggle
for
breath
his
palms
sweat
so
much
the
reins
were
slippery
in
his
hands
he
turned
and
waved
farewell
to
iron
knife
and
the
four
other
braves
following
them
who
had
halted
their
ponies
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
dismounted
they
waved
back
a
moment
more
and
white
bear
looked
back
and
could
see
them
no
more
least
if
i
die
today
iron
knife
can
tell
redbird
how
it
came
he
tried
to
guess
how
the
long
knives
would
greet
them
they
might
shoot
them
down
in
spite
of
the
white
flag
he
hoped
they
would
be
glad
to
learn
that
black
hawk
wanted
to
surrender
and
return
in
peace
to
ioway
after
all
that
was
what
they
were
trying
to
force
him
to
do
was
it
not
but
some
of
the
long
knives
undoubtedly
wanted
to
kill
injuns
men
like
raoul
when
they
came
out
of
the
south
edge
of
the
woods
they
found
themselves
on
a
grassy
rise
sloping
down
to
a
winding
stream
called
old
creek
the
sun
was
lower
now
and
directly
in
white
bear
eyes
across
the
creek
was
a
sight
that
made
him
want
to
jerk
his
pony
head
around
and
ride
back
into
the
trees
as
fast
as
he
could
go
on
high
ground
he
saw
the
silhouettes
of
peaked
tents
and
many
men
some
on
horseback
and
some
on
foot
rifles
in
hand
the
smoke
of
campfires
drifted
like
gray
feathers
into
the
pale
blue
sky
he
heard
voices
calling
to
one
another
in
english
one
man
shouted
and
pointed
in
their
direction
white
bear
said
do
wait
here
at
the
edge
of
the
trees
or
they
will
think
we
are
attackers
ride
forward
slowly
waving
the
flag
the
men
across
the
creek
were
yelling
excitedly
now
rifle
fire
crackled
and
smoke
billowed
a
ball
whizzed
past
white
bear
and
cracked
a
tree
limb
behind
him
he
held
himself
rigid
long
knives
rode
toward
them
urging
their
horses
down
the
far
side
of
the
creekbank
white
bear
and
his
companions
rode
into
the
creek
to
meet
them
in
a
moment
bearded
white
faces
angry
eyes
coonskin
caps
and
straw
hats
were
whirling
about
the
three
emissaries
in
the
middle
of
the
creek
rifles
and
pistols
were
pointing
at
them
from
every
side
little
crow
his
face
tight
held
the
white
flag
high
with
both
hands
we
surrender
white
bear
shouted
we
are
not
armed
we
have
come
to
talk
to
general
atkinson
listen
to
that
he
talking
english
a
blond
boy
exclaimed
another
man
yelled
shoot
then
let
surrender
white
bear
knees
trembled
against
his
horse
flanks
these
were
not
regular
government
soldiers
but
the
volunteers
the
armed
settlers
who
had
come
out
in
answer
to
their
governor
call
they
would
not
wait
for
orders
from
their
commanders
they
would
do
whatever
they
felt
like
doing
a
man
stuck
his
face
in
white
bear
get
down
off
that
horse
injun
now
his
shout
blew
a
stink
of
whiskey
into
white
face
others
joined
the
outcry
get
off
them
horses
ought
to
put
a
bullet
in
them
right
here
in
the
creek
look
at
them
black
faces
i
thought
they
was
niggers
at
first
not
even
useful
like
niggers
damn
redskins
the
man
with
the
red
beard
grabbed
white
bear
arm
and
jerked
him
half
out
of
his
saddle
white
bear
slid
down
from
his
horse
he
stood
up
to
his
knees
in
the
cold
rushing
water
of
old
man
creek
we
want
to
surrender
he
said
again
we
want
to
talk
to
your
officers
just
shut
up
the
man
roared
eyes
rolling
drunkenly
white
bear
felt
a
man
grab
him
from
behind
a
rope
scratched
his
wrists
and
tightened
around
them
till
the
bones
were
crushed
together
he
turned
to
see
whether
little
crow
and
three
horses
were
all
right
the
militiamen
had
bound
them
too
both
braves
faces
were
expressionless
but
white
bear
read
fear
in
their
eyes
and
in
the
set
of
their
mouths
the
same
fear
he
felt
and
tried
not
to
show
the
man
leaned
down
from
his
saddle
and
grabbed
a
handful
of
white
bear
long
hair
he
jerked
on
it
dragging
white
bear
toward
the
bank
white
bear
stumbled
on
the
stony
creekbed
bruising
his
feet
through
his
moccasins
you
wan
na
see
our
officers
then
step
along
what
had
happened
to
the
white
flag
without
it
what
did
they
have
to
show
that
they
had
come
in
peace
will
you
bring
our
white
flag
he
called
desperately
to
a
man
wearing
spectacles
who
looked
a
little
calmer
than
the
others
the
man
face
twisted
into
a
snarl
and
white
bear
heart
fell
you
get
your
white
flag
up
your
ass
redskin
you
sound
just
like
a
white
man
said
another
militiaman
you
sure
you
ai
a
white
man
in
paint
listen
to
me
white
bear
said
hopelessly
he
wanted
to
say
we
do
fight
it
will
save
your
lives
as
well
as
but
how
could
he
talk
to
these
men
maddened
by
whiskey
and
war
his
eyes
met
those
of
little
crow
and
three
horses
again
the
man
jerked
his
hair
so
hard
white
bear
thought
he
would
pull
it
out
of
his
scalp
he
had
to
bite
his
lip
to
keep
from
crying
out
worse
than
the
pain
was
the
indignity
horses
splashing
water
mud
and
pebbles
on
them
long
knives
shouting
curses
and
threats
the
three
sauk
stumbled
out
of
the
creek
and
through
prairie
grass
into
the
militia
camp
the
sun
last
rays
fell
on
flushed
sweating
white
faces
on
glistening
rifle
barrels
to
white
bear
most
of
the
men
looked
younger
than
he
somebody
get
the
colonel
said
the
man
with
the
red
beard
tell
him
they
claim
they
want
to
surrender
might
be
we
could
catch
old
black
hawk
himself
the
three
sauks
only
hope
white
bear
thought
was
that
the
commanding
officer
might
be
more
willing
to
listen
to
them
than
his
men
were
the
sauk
and
their
captors
stood
in
a
circle
where
the
grass
had
been
trampled
flat
a
short
distance
away
stood
supply
wagons
and
tents
the
prairie
surrounded
them
some
militiamen
went
to
one
wagon
on
which
five
kegs
with
spouts
stood
filled
tin
cups
from
the
kegs
and
drank
from
them
whiskey
white
bear
thought
seemed
to
be
as
important
to
these
men
as
food
the
sun
was
down
now
and
the
three
stood
in
twilight
in
the
midst
of
the
shouting
mob
look
alive
you
men
it
the
colonel
the
crowd
opened
up
and
two
men
came
through
one
of
them
short
skinny
wearing
a
coonskin
cap
and
a
blue
coat
came
up
to
white
bear
and
peered
at
him
i
know
you
half
his
teeth
were
rotten
and
the
rest
were
missing
white
bear
knew
him
too
eli
greenglove
by
god
raoul
i
be
a
son
of
a
bitch
if
it
ai
that
nephew
of
yours
and
there
stood
raoul
de
marion
gold
epaulets
glittering
on
his
broad
shoulders
at
the
sight
of
that
broad
face
with
the
black
mustache
last
seen
looking
at
him
over
a
pistol
barrel
white
bear
knew
his
life
was
about
to
end
my
luck
be
any
worse
all
hope
vanished
as
light
faded
from
the
sky
raoul
stood
before
white
bear
with
his
thumbs
hooked
into
the
white
leather
belt
that
cinched
his
blue
uniform
coat
his
huge
knife
the
one
that
had
cut
white
bear
face
years
ago
hung
at
his
left
side
a
pistol
at
his
right
he
grinned
at
white
bear
well
i
was
hoping
to
meet
you
i
have
liked
it
better
on
the
field
of
battle
but
here
you
are
in
my
camp
what
were
you
doing
spying
on
us
white
bear
sighed
something
crumbled
inside
him
do
you
know
this
long
knife
little
crow
said
in
sauk
yes
he
is
my
father
brother
a
glimmer
of
hope
appeared
in
little
crow
eyes
but
vanished
when
white
bear
added
and
he
is
my
worst
enemy
talk
english
around
me
raoul
shouted
no
indian
jabber
black
hawk
sent
us
white
bear
said
he
does
want
to
fight
come
to
make
peace
the
hell
with
that
one
of
raoul
men
yelled
we
come
out
to
fight
injuns
well
hold
on
now
cried
another
if
they
come
peaceable
that
means
we
can
all
go
home
and
nobody
hurt
raoul
turned
on
the
man
i
be
the
one
to
decide
why
they
here
white
bear
realized
that
the
men
with
raoul
were
barely
under
his
control
there
was
no
hope
of
talking
to
raoul
but
there
might
be
others
in
this
crowd
like
the
man
who
had
just
spoken
who
would
listen
he
must
keep
trying
raising
his
voice
white
bear
said
chief
black
hawk
knows
you
militiamen
outnumber
his
warriors
he
does
want
to
fight
you
all
he
wants
is
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
down
the
rock
river
and
cross
the
mississippi
he
will
never
come
back
where
that
redskin
learn
to
speak
english
so
good
one
of
the
militiamen
said
he
a
renegade
said
raoul
a
mongrel
he
ought
to
be
hanged
as
a
traitor
do
believe
a
word
he
says
they
did
come
with
a
white
flag
one
of
the
men
said
white
flag
hell
raoul
shouted
they
trying
to
put
us
off
guard
he
swept
a
pointing
finger
across
a
group
of
men
that
included
armand
perrault
among
them
white
bear
recognized
levi
pope
and
otto
wegner
the
prussian
who
worked
at
the
trading
post
he
remembered
wegner
had
not
wanted
to
kill
him
when
raoul
offered
a
reward
for
his
death
and
he
felt
a
little
tremor
of
hope
get
on
your
horses
raoul
told
his
men
go
out
across
the
creek
and
look
if
you
do
find
indians
skulking
about
in
those
woods
i
be
mighty
surprised
as
raoul
men
rode
off
white
bear
was
torn
by
indecision
should
he
tell
raoul
that
other
braves
had
followed
them
here
to
see
how
they
were
treated
or
would
that
just
endanger
the
lives
of
iron
knife
and
the
others
use
everything
i
tell
him
against
raoul
eyes
stared
death
at
white
bear
black
hawk
a
damn
liar
broken
every
treaty
we
ever
made
with
you
people
there
only
one
way
to
deal
with
your
kind
if
you
ca
be
trusted
to
keep
treaties
you
have
to
be
exterminated
he
drew
his
pistol
starting
here
spirit
walk
with
me
on
the
trail
of
little
crow
said
what
do
they
say
white
bear
are
they
going
to
kill
us
it
is
our
fate
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
bad
man
said
white
bear
having
to
tell
them
hurt
him
all
the
more
it
grieved
him
that
these
two
good
men
must
die
along
with
him
their
lives
thrown
away
because
of
a
bit
of
bad
luck
we
were
fools
to
come
here
said
three
horses
not
fools
braves
white
bear
reassured
him
a
man
who
gives
his
life
to
protect
his
people
is
never
a
fool
whether
or
not
he
succeeds
you
a
prophet
white
bear
said
little
crow
raoul
was
staring
at
white
bear
chest
white
bear
wondered
if
his
heart
was
beating
so
hard
that
raoul
could
see
it
hammering
look
at
those
scars
looks
like
a
bear
tried
to
get
you
a
long
time
ago
too
bad
he
did
finish
you
would
have
saved
me
the
trouble
white
bear
would
not
talk
about
anything
sacred
with
raoul
he
looked
back
at
him
silently
guess
you
do
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
your
nephew
eli
greenglove
laughed
do
call
him
my
nephew
raoul
shouted
white
bear
saw
some
of
raoul
men
exchange
befuddled
glances
well
whatever
he
is
i
kind
of
think
we
ought
to
send
him
and
these
others
back
down
the
line
let
them
palaver
with
the
general
it
for
us
to
decide
what
the
hell
do
you
mean
raoul
thundered
the
popping
of
rifle
fire
on
the
other
side
of
old
man
creek
cut
short
the
argument
white
bear
turned
to
look
a
moment
later
perrault
his
horse
legs
dripping
creek
water
came
pounding
up
you
were
right
mon
colonel
he
panted
those
woods
are
full
of
indians
they
were
sneaking
up
on
the
camp
these
three
were
supposed
to
distract
us
with
peace
talk
while
the
others
snuck
up
on
us
raoul
shouted
to
his
men
first
we
shoot
these
indians
then
we
hunt
down
the
rest
of
them
it
was
an
ambush
white
bear
cried
there
were
only
five
of
them
and
they
were
just
there
to
see
what
happened
to
us
well
why
did
you
tell
us
they
were
out
there
raoul
said
smiling
we
have
invited
them
in
for
a
whiskey
the
men
standing
near
him
guffawed
raoul
lips
stretched
in
a
grimace
eli
armand
let
shoot
these
three
redskins
greenglove
said
raoul
colonel
i
still
say
you
ought
to
think
this
over
shut
up
and
do
what
i
say
raoul
growled
i
want
to
get
this
done
and
ride
after
those
other
indians
men
were
running
for
their
horses
and
leaping
into
the
saddle
brandishing
rifles
without
leaders
or
orders
they
rode
off
across
the
creek
with
drunken
whoops
in
the
direction
armand
had
pointed
out
white
bear
felt
sick
as
he
saw
that
many
of
the
men
who
remained
were
grinning
avidly
how
he
wondered
could
their
deaths
give
such
pleasure
to
these
men
desperate
to
find
help
he
searched
the
ring
of
men
surrounding
him
for
a
face
to
appeal
to
it
was
already
too
dark
to
see
expressions
clearly
hopelessness
turned
his
heart
to
lead
as
he
saw
otto
wegner
turn
and
walk
away
from
the
crowd
even
though
wegner
had
always
been
raoul
man
and
never
a
friend
of
his
he
felt
betrayed
all
right
said
raoul
staring
into
white
bear
eyes
i
shoot
the
mongrel
eli
you
shoot
the
short
one
with
the
flat
nose
armand
you
take
the
other
one
plaisir
said
armand
his
teeth
showing
white
in
his
brown
beard
as
he
brought
his
rifle
up
to
his
shoulder
white
bear
felt
the
clench
of
nausea
in
his
middle
only
pride
kept
him
from
doubling
up
and
vomiting
in
his
terror
do
do
this
please
he
cried
we
came
to
you
to
make
peace
they
mean
to
kill
us
said
little
crow
talk
no
more
to
them
white
bear
do
not
plead
it
is
unbecoming
a
sauk
white
bear
felt
a
rush
of
admiration
for
the
strength
and
calm
in
little
crow
voice
here
truly
was
a
brave
little
crow
raised
his
voice
in
song
in
your
brown
blanket
o
earthmaker
wrap
your
son
and
carry
him
away
fold
him
again
in
your
body
let
his
bones
turn
to
rocks
let
his
flesh
turn
to
grass
give
his
eyes
to
the
birds
give
his
ears
to
the
deer
grow
flowers
from
his
heart
white
bear
and
three
horses
joined
in
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
white
bear
wanted
to
die
singing
not
weeping
what
a
miserable
death
this
was
even
so
and
still
he
found
that
the
song
made
his
heart
feel
strong
and
his
terror
give
way
to
a
stern
anger
murdered
because
of
the
simple
stupid
bad
luck
that
raoul
band
of
militiamen
happened
to
be
the
advance
guard
of
the
long
knives
surrounded
by
drunken
savages
yes
they
were
the
savages
not
himself
and
three
horses
and
little
crow
infuriating
to
think
of
the
love
and
education
his
father
had
lavished
on
him
all
wasted
now
all
the
years
of
following
the
shaman
path
ended
by
a
lead
ball
before
he
had
accomplished
anything
and
redbird
and
eagle
feather
and
the
baby
to
come
if
not
for
them
he
might
accept
the
inevitable
step
onto
the
trail
of
souls
with
grace
and
dignity
but
even
more
for
their
sake
than
for
his
own
he
did
not
want
to
die
frantic
with
fear
and
anger
he
looked
for
a
way
of
escape
the
camp
was
in
the
midst
of
prairie
grass
almost
as
high
as
a
man
head
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
twilight
was
deepening
but
raoul
was
walking
toward
him
holding
his
pistol
high
and
beyond
him
between
white
bear
and
the
grass
was
a
ring
of
men
with
rifles
all
that
was
left
for
him
was
to
die
with
honor
he
raised
his
voice
to
sing
louder
must
put
all
my
strength
into
this
it
is
the
last
song
i
will
sing
on
stop
that
goddamned
caterwauling
raoul
shouted
white
bear
watched
numbly
as
armand
perrault
brought
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
stepped
up
to
little
crow
put
the
muzzle
of
the
rifle
to
the
brave
head
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
flint
clicked
down
and
sparked
and
powder
sizzled
in
the
pan
the
rifle
went
off
with
a
roar
enveloping
the
brave
head
in
a
pink
cloud
of
smoke
blood
bits
of
flesh
and
bone
white
bear
staggered
backward
dizzy
with
shock
and
terror
three
horses
shouted
i
will
not
die
so
he
jerked
free
from
the
men
who
were
holding
him
and
plunged
into
the
grass
hands
still
bound
behind
him
he
ran
toward
the
rock
river
rifles
boomed
in
his
panic
white
bear
felt
as
if
all
the
breath
had
been
knocked
out
of
him
three
horses
might
have
a
chance
he
was
a
short
man
and
the
grass
was
tall
and
light
was
fading
moment
by
moment
if
white
bear
stood
where
he
was
an
instant
longer
he
would
be
dead
this
was
his
only
chance
no
one
was
holding
him
no
one
was
even
pointing
a
gun
at
him
all
of
them
even
raoul
were
staring
after
three
horses
many
of
the
men
had
fired
and
would
need
time
to
reload
every
muscle
in
his
body
quivered
he
jerked
his
hands
the
rope
was
still
tight
around
his
wrists
running
would
be
awkward
but
three
horses
had
shown
that
it
could
be
done
white
bear
heard
the
voice
in
his
mind
his
own
voice
or
the
bear
spirit
it
did
not
matter
he
ran
he
threw
all
the
strength
in
his
legs
into
a
sudden
spring
away
from
the
distracted
long
knives
he
dove
into
the
grass
running
away
from
the
river
opposite
the
way
three
horses
had
gone
with
his
arms
behind
him
he
ran
with
his
head
and
shoulders
thrust
forward
the
grasses
and
tall
plants
slapped
his
face
his
feet
pounded
the
earth
his
legs
pumped
furiously
his
breath
roared
in
his
chest
his
heart
thundered
hey
the
other
injun
gettin
away
goddamn
it
him
raoul
voice
shrill
with
wild
rage
white
bear
moccasined
feet
seemed
to
be
flying
over
the
ground
he
felt
the
bear
spirit
giving
him
strength
a
curtain
of
prairie
grass
fell
away
ahead
of
him
and
swished
shut
behind
him
even
the
grass
was
helping
it
was
almost
high
enough
to
hide
him
as
he
ran
in
a
crouch
as
his
bound
wrists
forced
him
to
do
he
was
already
deep
into
the
prairie
when
he
heard
the
calm
voice
of
eli
greenglove
cutting
through
the
cool
clear
air
hold
your
fire
everybody
he
mine
got
a
bead
on
him
a
moment
later
lightning
struck
the
side
of
white
bear
head
sudden
and
stunning
he
heard
the
rifle
roar
just
an
instant
after
the
bullet
hit
him
it
struck
so
hard
it
left
him
no
strength
to
scream
his
right
ear
felt
as
if
it
had
been
torn
away
from
his
skull
a
blaze
of
agony
blinded
him
he
staggered
but
he
was
alive
dead
it
was
the
same
voice
in
his
mind
that
had
told
him
to
run
now
he
was
sure
it
was
the
bear
spirit
he
shut
his
eyes
threw
himself
at
once
to
the
ground
the
earth
came
up
and
hit
him
in
the
face
as
hard
as
a
fist
in
the
jaw
stunned
for
a
moment
he
sucked
air
into
his
chest
and
let
it
out
slowly
he
lay
perfectly
still
his
ear
felt
as
if
someone
had
laid
a
burning
torch
on
it
got
the
sonofabitch
came
eli
greenglove
flat
voice
from
only
a
short
distance
away
but
he
was
still
alive
and
no
one
was
shooting
at
him
his
body
went
limp
with
relief
he
could
not
believe
that
he
was
still
alive
and
conscious
i
am
dead
maybe
my
spirit
will
stand
up
in
a
moment
and
start
walking
greenglove
was
supposed
to
be
the
best
shot
in
smith
county
could
he
really
mistakenly
think
he
hit
white
bear
square
in
the
head
his
eyes
were
better
than
that
white
bear
heard
distant
shots
let
three
horses
live
if
three
horses
had
not
run
when
he
did
white
bear
would
not
be
alive
now
but
white
bear
remembered
with
anguish
that
he
had
seen
little
crow
die
my
brother
even
though
half
dead
with
pain
and
terror
himself
he
mourned
the
brave
who
had
died
before
his
eyes
blood
pounded
in
white
bear
head
night
was
growing
steadily
deeper
by
not
moving
and
by
taking
only
the
tiniest
breaths
he
might
appear
to
be
dead
he
lay
with
his
mutilated
right
ear
uppermost
he
felt
streams
of
blood
running
like
lines
of
ants
over
his
scalp
and
his
cheek
they
tickled
his
neck
to
lie
perfectly
still
was
agony
white
bear
heard
raoul
voice
say
make
sure
of
him
eli
damn
hellfire
nation
eli
came
back
do
i
know
when
i
put
a
man
under
it
dark
and
you
had
a
lot
of
whiskey
make
sure
of
him
pure
waste
of
time
said
greenglove
white
bear
heard
footsteps
rustling
through
the
grass
toward
him
the
effort
of
keeping
himself
from
moving
threatened
to
tear
his
muscles
from
his
bones
his
heart
beat
harder
as
the
steps
came
closer
surely
greenglove
could
hear
its
thudding
but
he
froze
himself
and
held
his
breath
as
the
feet
stopped
beside
him
in
stillness
was
his
only
hope
the
pain
throbbed
in
his
ear
see
that
he
just
hit
my
ear
and
that
will
be
the
should
he
jump
up
and
run
for
it
no
greenglove
would
not
miss
a
second
time
let
the
bear
spirit
dim
greenglove
sharp
eyes
let
him
be
deceived
into
thinking
white
bear
dead
there
was
no
other
way
he
could
escape
he
waited
for
the
shot
that
would
smash
into
his
brain
right
through
the
skull
greenglove
called
out
ai
even
enough
left
to
scalp
him
amazement
flooded
through
white
bear
that
could
be
what
greenglove
saw
unless
he
was
blind
drunk
or
blinded
by
the
bear
he
does
want
to
kill
had
he
tried
to
talk
raoul
out
of
shooting
the
three
of
them
white
bear
remembered
greenglove
swinging
the
rifle
at
him
the
day
of
his
father
funeral
if
greenglove
had
knocked
him
out
raoul
would
have
shot
him
he
was
too
frightened
to
try
to
understand
it
he
was
alive
that
was
all
he
could
be
sure
of
alive
for
a
little
while
longer
he
in
the
happy
hunting
ground
greenglove
voice
faded
a
little
as
he
walked
away
want
us
to
dig
a
hole
for
him
we
do
bury
dead
indians
said
raoul
let
them
rot
let
the
buzzards
get
fat
on
them
he
raised
his
voice
every
man
mount
up
and
chase
the
ones
there
in
the
woods
across
the
creek
this
may
be
our
chance
to
finish
black
hawk
what
happened
to
that
other
injun
that
ran
away
greenglove
asked
we
got
him
a
militiaman
said
he
made
it
almost
to
the
river
but
he
got
enough
lead
in
him
now
to
start
his
own
mine
grief
filled
white
bear
motionless
body
little
crow
and
three
horses
both
killed
three
horses
death
had
given
him
back
his
life
three
horses
the
first
sauk
to
greet
him
on
his
return
to
the
tribe
his
two
comrades
surely
deserved
to
escape
death
as
much
as
he
did
why
had
he
alone
been
spared
he
wanted
to
cry
out
as
sorrow
for
his
fallen
comrades
tore
into
him
but
he
drew
in
his
lower
lip
he
bit
down
on
it
hard
clenching
his
teeth
in
his
flesh
until
he
felt
no
pain
anywhere
else
in
mind
or
body
three
horses
little
crow
i
will
burn
tobacco
to
the
spirits
for
boots
clumped
through
the
prairie
grass
all
around
him
pounded
past
him
he
feared
he
would
be
trampled
and
it
took
effort
to
hold
still
but
the
horses
avoided
his
body
gradually
the
thundering
passage
of
raoul
men
died
away
to
the
north
for
a
long
time
white
bear
heard
nothing
but
the
creek
rippling
over
its
bed
of
stones
the
wind
in
the
trees
crickets
buzzing
on
the
prairie
tiny
creatures
tickled
his
flesh
as
they
hurried
over
his
face
and
body
to
them
he
had
already
become
part
of
the
earth
the
burning
in
his
ear
settled
down
to
a
numb
ache
he
heard
the
crack
of
rifle
shots
a
long
way
off
raoul
men
pursuing
black
hawk
scouts
must
more
of
his
brothers
die
tonight
he
opened
his
eyes
it
was
now
very
dark
full
night
had
fallen
he
was
lying
on
his
left
side
in
tall
grass
he
took
a
chance
and
raised
his
head
a
little
way
raoul
had
said
he
wanted
no
men
to
stay
behind
but
there
might
be
someone
about
he
dropped
his
head
and
tensed
his
hands
and
arms
the
rope
around
his
wrists
had
loosened
he
could
twist
his
wrists
till
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
reached
the
knot
pale
eyes
knew
little
about
tying
secure
knots
after
working
patiently
for
a
long
time
he
freed
his
hands
he
still
felt
sick
with
grief
and
did
not
have
the
strength
to
move
away
from
this
place
where
his
comrades
had
died
why
not
just
lie
here
and
wait
for
the
long
knives
to
come
back
and
kill
him
but
he
thought
of
redbird
and
eagle
feather
and
the
fullness
that
had
appeared
in
redbird
belly
before
they
crossed
the
great
river
from
ioway
to
illinois
using
his
knees
and
elbows
to
push
himself
through
the
grass
he
began
to
crawl
slithering
like
a
snake
his
body
and
limbs
flat
to
the
ground
he
wriggled
along
the
edge
of
the
creek
till
he
felt
sure
any
men
that
might
be
nearby
could
not
see
him
then
he
slid
down
the
embankment
the
side
of
his
head
throbbed
with
every
movement
he
crossed
the
creek
on
all
fours
the
rocks
biting
into
his
palms
and
knees
where
the
swift
cold
water
was
deepest
he
lowered
his
head
into
the
water
to
wash
it
agony
exploded
in
his
brain
and
he
came
close
to
fainting
but
he
forced
the
muscles
of
his
neck
to
raise
his
head
and
his
arms
and
legs
to
push
him
along
out
of
the
creek
soon
he
was
in
the
shelter
of
the
woods
he
stood
up
and
staggered
through
the
shrubbery
now
that
he
was
safer
the
pain
in
his
torn
right
ear
pounded
harder
than
ever
he
remembered
that
raoul
and
his
hundreds
of
mounted
long
knives
had
ridden
toward
the
place
where
black
hawk
with
only
forty
braves
was
waiting
to
learn
how
his
peace
emissaries
fared
he
had
stayed
alive
so
far
by
luck
but
he
had
no
real
hope
of
escaping
to
his
people
probably
some
of
the
long
knives
who
had
ridden
out
with
raoul
would
come
across
him
and
that
would
be
the
end
as
he
neared
the
farther
edge
of
the
woods
a
newly
risen
like
a
white
wickiup
in
a
black
field
shone
at
him
through
the
trees
ahead
he
was
about
to
step
out
on
the
prairie
when
he
heard
the
rumble
of
hooves
coming
toward
him
he
stopped
in
the
shelter
of
the
trees
he
heard
shots
screams
of
pain
and
terror
against
the
lighter
prairie
grass
men
on
horseback
were
dark
shapes
rushing
at
him
from
the
horizon
their
voices
were
fearful
they
were
crying
out
in
english
make
a
stand
in
the
woods
no
there
too
many
of
them
just
keep
follow
the
river
white
bear
looked
about
for
a
hiding
place
the
moon
showed
him
that
he
was
standing
beside
a
big
old
oak
with
branches
low
enough
for
him
to
jump
to
oak
will
you
shelter
me
just
before
he
jumped
for
a
branch
he
noticed
that
a
hollow
had
rotted
out
in
the
base
of
the
tree
it
was
big
enough
for
him
to
hide
in
but
then
he
would
be
on
the
same
level
as
the
militiamen
safer
up
high
he
forced
his
tired
legs
to
spring
managed
to
grip
the
lowest
limb
one
hand
on
each
side
of
it
bark
scratching
his
palms
he
pressed
the
soles
of
his
moccasins
flat
against
the
trunk
and
walked
his
body
up
panting
until
he
was
able
to
pull
himself
up
over
the
limb
and
reach
for
the
next
one
the
branches
were
stout
and
close
together
and
soon
he
was
high
above
the
floor
of
the
wood
made
a
ladder
for
me
thank
you
grandfather
dozens
of
mounted
militiamen
were
streaming
past
his
tree
galloping
right
under
him
the
hoofbeats
of
the
horses
and
the
shouts
of
the
men
to
one
another
pitched
high
with
terror
shattered
the
night
air
he
saw
the
black
shapes
of
more
horses
and
riders
swimming
through
the
prairie
grass
their
elated
cries
were
sauk
war
whoops
the
braves
of
his
tribe
racing
toward
him
as
if
to
rescue
him
a
sun
rose
in
his
breast
rifles
boomed
and
arrows
whistled
through
the
air
after
the
fleeing
militiamen
and
he
was
thankful
that
he
was
up
this
high
he
heard
screams
somewhere
nearby
a
body
crashed
into
shrubbery
some
long
knives
he
saw
were
trying
to
go
around
the
woods
but
the
greater
distance
they
had
to
travel
gave
the
sauk
riders
time
to
catch
up
with
them
rifle
shots
flashed
like
lightning
in
the
darkness
two
shadowy
figures
on
foot
so
close
together
they
seemed
one
stumbled
out
of
the
tall
grass
and
pushed
their
way
into
the
woods
careless
of
the
noise
they
were
making
white
bear
held
his
breath
hoping
they
would
not
discover
him
above
them
a
voice
below
him
said
you
got
to
keep
going
they
catch
you
and
tomahawk
you
sure
now
the
two
men
were
standing
by
the
tree
in
which
he
had
taken
shelter
he
strained
his
ears
to
listen
save
yourself
said
another
voice
rasping
with
pain
i
can
not
run
the
arrow
is
under
my
kneecap
i
will
stay
here
and
try
to
hold
them
off
know
that
voice
that
accent
it
is
the
prussian
otto
white
bear
remembered
how
wegner
had
disappointed
him
back
at
camp
now
his
life
was
in
danger
he
deserved
that
hold
them
off
there
hunnerds
of
them
he
heard
the
other
voice
before
but
he
sounded
like
so
many
long
knives
white
bear
could
not
be
sure
that
he
knew
him
well
maybe
if
i
shoot
a
few
of
them
you
can
get
away
at
that
white
bear
felt
anger
heating
up
in
his
chest
so
wegner
would

last
bullet
on

white
bear
felt
his
cheeks
burn
with
shame
for
himself
the
idea
of
torturing
a
prisoner
was
unthinkable
and
he
did
not
believe
black
hawk
would
allow
it
but
he
could
not
be
sure
many
men
and
women
of
the
british
band
he
supposed
would
enjoy
making
one
of
the
dreaded
long
knives
suffer
white
bear
heard
pope
scurry
off
through
the
brush
while
wegner
gasping
with
pain
settled
himself
in
position
at
the
base
of
the
tree
the
boom
of
wegner
rifle
below
him
so
startled
white
bear
that
he
almost
fell
from
his
perch
he
heard
an
agonized
cry
from
out
on
the
prairie
saw
a
brave
fall
from
a
horse
killed
one
of
my
brothers
i
ca
let
this
he
heard
quick
metallic
sounds
of
clicking
and
scraping
below
him
the
sounds
of
a
man
loading
his
rifle
a
moment
another
sauk
warrior
will
the
racking
grief
white
bear
had
felt
since
the
deaths
of
little
crow
and
three
horses
changed
all
at
once
into
a
whirlwind
of
rage
he
remembered
little
crow
bound
and
helpless
his
head
blown
apart
he
pictured
three
horses
body
torn
by
bullets
in
his
whole
life
up
to
now
he
had
never
killed
a
man
but
surely
now
after
what
he
had
suffered
and
seen
he
had
to
kill
him
how
he
is
armed
and
i
am
but
wegner
was
in
dire
pain
white
bear
could
jump
out
of
the
tree
on
the
prussian
back
and
bring
his
foot
down
hard
on
the
knee
with
the
arrow
in
it
that
should
hurt
wegner
enough
to
loosen
his
grip
on
his
rifle
so
that
white
bear
could
get
it
away
from
him
and
shoot
him
with
it
or
smash
his
skull
more
sauk
braves
were
riding
closer
and
wegner
must
be
taking
aim
in
the
darkness
down
there
white
bear
scrambled
down
the
ladder
of
tree
limbs
he
had
climbed
as
he
reached
the
lowest
limb
moonlight
showed
wegner
rolling
over
his
eyes
gleaming
the
rifle
barrel
swung
toward
him
heard
white
bear
leaped
the
flash
blinded
him
for
an
instant
in
a
suffocating
cloud
of
powder
smoke
he
hit
wegner
chest
with
knees
and
hands
an
impact
that
knocked
the
breath
from
him
wegner
screamed
in
pain
a
high
womanish
sound
that
made
white
bear
ears
ring
more
than
the
shot
had
the
prussian
under
him
battered
him
with
the
rifle
trying
to
turn
it
so
that
he
could
hit
him
with
the
butt
white
bear
had
both
hands
on
the
stock
and
tried
to
kick
wegner
knee
as
their
bodies
bucked
and
thrashed
at
the
base
of
the
oak
white
bear
remembered
that
militiamen
often
carried
hunting
knives
in
shirt
pockets
gripping
wegner
rifle
with
one
hand
he
reached
down
the
front
of
the
prussian
leather
jacket
wegner
eyes
widened
in
fear
and
he
thrust
frantically
with
his
rifle
white
bear
felt
the
handle
of
a
knife
and
pulled
it
free
the
broad
steel
blade
twinkled
reflecting
moon
and
stars
now
one
thrust
into
his
enemy
throat
white
bear
slid
the
point
under
the
bandanna
around
wegner
neck
and
pressed
it
into
the
soft
place
just
above
the
collarbone
the
man
eyes
seemed
about
to
pop
out
of
his
head
his
thick
dark
mustache
was
drawn
back
from
his
clenched
teeth
trying
to
make
himself
kill
the
man
white
bear
felt
as
sick
in
his
stomach
as
he
had
when
he
was
waiting
for
raoul
bullet
and
he
remembered
again
the
night
after
raoul
had
driven
him
out
of
victoire
and
offered
fifty
pieces
of
eight
for
his
death
what
he
had
heard
otto
wegner
say
he
did
not
push
the
knife
any
farther
but
he
realized
that
wegner
would
still
kill
him
given
any
chance
he
held
himself
ready
to
strike
drop
your
rifle
he
whispered
slide
it
away
from
you
make
a
sudden
move
and
i
cut
your
throat
wegner
did
as
white
bear
told
him
he
said
you
are
keeping
me
alive
to
torture
me
if
he
brought
wegner
back
to
the
sauk
white
bear
thought
the
warriors
would
want
to
kill
him
slowly
again
he
felt
that
hot
shame
do
you
know
who
i
am
he
asked
you
are
raoul
de
marion
nephew
auguste
how
can
you
be
still
alive
i
saw
greenglove
shoot
you
white
bear
ignored
the
question
three
of
us
came
to
you
under
a
white
flag
to
talk
peace
and
you
shot
us
it
was
wrong
you
say
that
now
when
i
hold
a
knife
on
you
why
did
you
speak
up
then
colonel
de
marion
is
my
commanding
officer
kill
me
damn
you
is
it
not
your
duty
a
warrior
does
as
he
pleases
with
his
captives
white
bear
heard
all
around
him
on
the
prairie
and
in
the
woods
the
war
cries
and
whistle
signals
of
the
sauk
braves
it
would
not
be
long
before
someone
discovered
white
bear
crouched
on
top
of
this
man
holding
a
knife
point
to
his
throat
wegner
said
if
i
could
i
would
kill
you
yet
if
you
had
caught
me
the
night
my
uncle
offered
fifty
spanish
dollars
for
my
death
you
would
have
let
me
go
how
do
you
know
that
it
amused
him
to
answer
wegner
question
by
saying
i
am
a
shaman
a
medicine
man
we
know
things
dummes
zeug
wegner
muttered
rubbish
he
said
louder
but
his
eyes
wavered
white
bear
said
i
am
a
healer
that
is
my
work
i
will
not
kill
you
unless
i
have
to
give
me
your
word
you
will
not
attack
me
and
i
will
take
the
knife
from
your
throat
wegner
closed
his
eyes
and
sighed
you
are
civilized
maybe
i
can
trust
you
white
bear
could
not
help
laughing
you
saw
today
what
civilized
men
do
to
their
prisoners
you
can
trust
me
because
i
am
a
sauk
and
why
do
you
trust
me
because
i
think
you
are
a
man
of
honor
all
right
you
have
my
word
white
bear
slowly
drew
back
and
stood
over
wegner
the
prussian
sat
up
then
groaned
in
the
moonlight
white
bear
saw
tears
streaming
uncontrollably
from
his
eyes
white
bear
had
him
sit
with
his
back
to
the
hollow
tree
he
brought
his
face
close
to
the
knee
with
his
eyes
adjusted
to
the
darkness
the
rays
were
enough
to
show
him
that
wegner
had
broken
off
the
end
of
the
arrow
and
the
rest
of
it
protruded
from
his
kneecap
the
arrow
had
gone
into
the
joint
it
hurt
white
bear
just
to
look
at
it
i
can
try
to
pull
this
out
white
bear
said
go
ahead
give
me
that
cloth
around
your
neck
with
wegner
bandanna
white
bear
wiped
the
blood
off
the
arrow
to
make
it
less
slippery
it
would
have
been
easier
if
wegner
had
not
broken
the
arrow
the
protruding
end
was
only
long
enough
to
let
white
bear
grip
it
with
one
hand
he
wrapped
his
left
hand
around
his
right
to
give
him
a
tighter
grip
and
pulled
with
all
his
strength
wegner
fell
over
on
his
side
in
a
faint
earthmaker
he
did
the
arrow
had
not
moved
at
all
when
wegner
came
around
white
bear
said
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
you
need
to
get
back
to
your
own
people
wegner
eyes
widened
you
would
let
me
go
i
have
to
or
else
kill
you
if
our
warriors
got
you
i
could
stop
them
from
killing
you
climb
into
this
hollow
in
the
tree
and
stay
there
till
morning
by
then
i
think
our
braves
will
be
far
from
here
he
helped
wegner
to
stand
and
boosted
him
up
into
his
hiding
place
wegner
let
out
a
groan
as
he
drew
his
wounded
leg
inside
the
opening
care
of
this
pale
eyes
grandfather
i
will
never
forget
this
said
wegner
then
remember
my
people
he
took
wegner
knife
and
rifle
he
might
have
left
the
prussian
a
weapon
to
defend
himself
but
he
thought
that
would
be
going
beyond
kindness
into
foolishness
he
heard
sauk
victory
shouts
coming
from
the
other
side
of
old
creek
where
raoul
camp
had
been
little
though
he
wanted
to
go
back
there
it
seemed
the
surest
way
to
safety
carrying
the
rifle
with
one
hand
the
knife
in
his
belt
he
made
his
way
through
the
woods
to
the
creek
soon
he
was
back
in
the
center
of
what
had
been
the
long
knives
camp
at
the
place
where
he
had
nearly
been
killed
a
small
fire
burned
here
near
it
lay
two
bodies
stretched
out
the
head
of
one
was
covered
with
a
cloth
that
white
bear
thought
must
be
little
crow
beside
him
lay
three
horses
a
blanket
draped
over
his
short
body
his
face
with
its
flattened
nose
uncovered
standing
around
the
bodies
were
half
a
dozen
warriors
by
all
rights
he
ought
to
be
lying
there
too
he
put
a
hand
up
to
his
ear
forgotten
in
the
excitement
of
the
encounter
with
otto
wegner
the
pain
had
settled
to
a
dull
pulsing
gingerly
he
felt
the
wound
the
middle
part
of
the
ear
was
gone
the
intact
upper
and
lower
parts
were
covered
with
crusted
blood
he
had
washed
the
wound
once
in
the
creek
he
must
wash
it
again
and
bandage
it
did
that
so
blood
would
flow
and
it
would
seem
to
anyone
who
looked
at
me
in
the
twilight
that
i
been
shot
in
the
head
he
was
trying
to
save
my
life
why
one
day
white
bear
hoped
he
would
meet
greenglove
and
find
out
why
he
had
spared
him
that
other
time
when
he
hit
me
with
his
rifle
just
as
raoul
was
about
to
shoot
me
did
he
do
that
too
to
save
my
life
a
solitary
warrior
sat
before
the
fire
a
long
scalplock
adorned
with
feathers
hanging
down
the
side
of
his
head
the
firelight
gleamed
on
his
shaven
head
and
glittered
on
the
beads
around
the
rims
of
his
ears
the
bowl
of
the
pipe
he
smoked
was
part
of
a
steel
tomahawk
blade
the
stem
of
the
pipe
was
the
tomahawk
handle
he
looked
up
and
his
eyes
widened
when
white
bear
stepped
into
the
firelight
white
bear
came
black
hawk
gravelly
voice
are
you
truly
alive
or
do
you
come
back
from
the
trail
of
souls
white
bear
felt
an
immense
warmth
as
the
firelight
showed
him
black
hawk
teeth
flashing
in
one
of
his
rare
smiles
i
am
alive
said
white
bear
i
am
happy
i
am
surprised
black
hawk
cried
waving
his
pipe
i
thought
all
three
of
you
were
dead
sudden
elation
dizzied
white
bear
and
the
flesh
of
his
back
prickled
as
he
realized
what
it
meant
to
see
black
hawk
sitting
quietly
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
center
of
raoul
camp
victory
the
long
knives
routed
how
had
it
happened
black
hawk
might
have
made
a
terrible
mistake
leading
the
sauk
across
the
great
river
but
at
that
moment
white
bear
loved
him
owl
carver
stepped
out
of
the
shadows
carrying
a
bundle
of
goods
he
had
been
gathering
from
the
tents
of
the
long
knives
he
dropped
his
bundle
to
throw
his
arms
around
white
bear
my
son
is
restored
to
me
white
bear
sat
down
at
the
fire
how
did
you
escape
black
hawk
asked
white
bear
explained
how
he
had
played
dead
when
eli
greenglove
claimed
to
have
hit
him
he
said
nothing
about
meeting
otto
wegner
he
felt
good
about
having
spared
wegner
life
but
he
was
not
sure
black
hawk
would
understand
in
fact
white
bear
was
not
sure
he
himself
understood
owl
carver
made
white
bear
hold
his
head
close
to
the
firelight
while
he
examined
the
wound
muttering
truly
the
things
the
long
knives
do
pass
all
understanding
he
said
it
was
dark
you
were
in
grass
maybe
he
missed
he
missed
on
purpose
he
has
great
fame
as
a
marksman
he
sees
very
well
he
came
and
stood
over
me
and
must
have
known
i
was
alive
owl
carver
searched
through
his
bundle
of
loot
and
found
a
kerchief
and
tied
it
around
white
bear
head
to
protect
the
wounded
ear
chills
of
exultation
rippled
up
white
bear
spine
as
he
looked
around
and
saw
black
hawk
braves
plundering
the
very
camp
where
raoul
men
had
swarmed
and
had
killed
his
two
companions
at
sunset
earthmaker
has
given
us
a
mighty
victory
he
said
we
never
expected
it
said
owl
carver
we
were
camped
on
the
rock
river
north
of
here
when
iron
knife
rode
in
after
sunset
to
say
that
you
three
had
been
killed
and
also
two
of
the
braves
who
had
gone
with
him
he
told
us
that
a
whole
army
of
long
knives
was
riding
toward
us
black
hawk
said
i
was
angry
they
had
killed
my
messengers
of
peace
i
did
not
care
that
there
were
hundreds
of
them
and
only
forty
of
us
i
wanted
vengeance
for
the
blood
they
had
shed
white
bear
laughed
i
heard
them
crying
out
as
they
fled
your
attack
they
thought
there
were
hundreds
of
the
hawk
spirit
flew
with
us
blinding
them
and
striking
fear
into
their
hearts
said
black
hawk
owl
carver
said
and
the
spirits
in
their
whiskey
befuddled
them
too
black
hawk
said
i
was
surprised
to
see
them
turn
tail
and
run
i
thought
americans
were
better
shooters
and
fiercer
fighters
than
that
they
outnumbered
us
many
times
over
but
they
showed
no
fight
at
all
the
winnebago
prophet
lumbered
out
of
the
darkness
and
sat
down
at
the
fireside
opposite
black
hawk
the
silver
lying
against
his
mustache
glittered
red
it
is
well
that
you
are
here
flying
cloud
said
black
hawk
we
must
look
along
the
trails
that
lie
ahead
of
us
white
bear
turned
away
in
disgust
after
the
winnebago
prophet
had
misled
black
hawk
so
badly
how
could
he
still
rely
on
him
a
gruff
voice
said
see
father
i
have
lifted
more
hair
from
our
enemies
white
bear
looked
up
wolf
paw
was
standing
over
them
holding
up
two
hanks
of
hair
each
with
a
bloody
circular
patch
of
flesh
attached
to
it
white
bear
hoped
that
one
of
those
scalps
did
not
belong
to
otto
wegner
black
hawk
stood
up
and
seized
wolf
paw
shoulders
my
heart
is
big
when
i
see
my
son
is
so
mighty
a
warrior
sitting
down
beside
his
father
wolf
paw
stared
at
white
bear
and
white
bear
had
to
explain
all
over
again
how
he
came
to
be
still
alive
after
a
moment
of
silence
black
hawk
spoke
until
tonight
there
was
no
blood
spilled
between
the
long
knives
and
us
but
when
we
tried
to
surrender
they
shot
our
messengers
he
gestured
to
the
bodies
near
the
fire
and
to
white
bear
and
now
we
have
killed
many
of
them
white
bear
felt
himself
trembling
with
rage
he
remembered
raoul
coming
toward
him
grinning
pistol
raised
right
on
this
spot
and
he
prayed
that
now
his
uncle
might
be
lying
dead
somewhere
on
the
prairie
an
arrow
in
his
back
killing
him
as
he
fled
black
hawk
warriors
a
hole
in
his
scalp
and
his
hair
dangling
from
some
brave
belt
bear
spirit
o
turtle
o
earthmaker
let
it
be
so
then
his
fury
faded
away
and
became
fear
as
he
realized
that
he
had
just
done
in
his
mind
a
thing
more
terrible
than
murder
a
man
might
call
on
the
spirits
for
the
strength
and
skill
to
fight
an
enemy
but
to
direct
the
power
of
the
spirits
against
another
man
no
matter
how
wicked
was
forbidden
he
prayed
no
harm
would
come
to
him
because
of
it
black
hawk
said
we
have
no
choice
now
the
long
knives
have
forced
war
upon
me
white
bear
spoke
up
quickly
before
wolf
paw
or
flying
cloud
could
call
for
war
as
they
were
certain
to
do
it
was
my
uncle
the
brother
of
star
arrow
who
ordered
us
three
to
be
killed
he
has
hated
our
people
all
of
his
life
he
especially
hates
me
a
different
war
chief
might
have
opened
his
arms
to
us
now
that
black
hawk
has
shown
the
long
knives
that
they
will
be
hurt
if
they
come
against
us
let
us
offer
peace
again
i
am
ready
to
go
again
with
a
white
flag
to
talk
of
surrender
with
other
war
chiefs
black
hawk
made
a
flat
rejecting
hand
gesture
you
have
seen
what
happened
pale
eyes
warriors
would
not
let
you
get
close
enough
to
talk
to
their
chiefs
a
warrior
came
over
to
the
fire
holding
a
tin
cup
he
offered
it
to
black
hawk
the
long
knives
left
five
barrels
of
whiskey
but
they
are
almost
empty
black
hawk
turned
the
cup
over
letting
the
whiskey
soak
into
the
dirt
pour
that
poison
on
the
ground
he
said
whiskey
made
the
long
knives
so
foolish
that
when
they
looked
at
one
of
our
braves
they
saw
ten
wolf
paw
said
they
abandoned
wagonloads
of
food
and
ammunition
even
some
rifles
we
will
need
them
said
black
hawk
without
more
provisions
we
can
not
go
on
after
the
warrior
went
away
black
hawk
gave
his
pipe
tomahawk
to
wolf
paw
to
smoke
owl
carver
and
the
winnebago
prophet
brought
out
pipes
of
their
own
owl
carver
offered
his
to
white
bear
who
declined
it
given
what
he
had
been
through
this
day
and
troubled
by
the
fear
that
black
hawk
was
determined
to
plunge
his
people
into
worse
calamities
white
bear
felt
his
stomach
could
not
stand
tobacco
smoke
flying
cloud
broke
the
thoughtful
silence
if
forty
sauk
warriors
could
chase
away
two
hundred
long
knives
then
all
the
sauk
warriors
can
chase
away
the
long
knives
whole
army
i
say
call
out
the
six
hundred
warriors
who
wait
at
our
main
camp
we
will
drive
the
long
knives
all
the
way
back
to
the
great
river
white
bear
wanted
to
answer
the
winnebago
prophet
with
angry
words
but
he
felt
and
nauseated
he
decided
to
wait
and
see
what
the
others
would
say
the
prophet
of
the
winnebago
speaks
well
said
wolf
paw
my
blade
is
hungry
for
more
long
knives
scalps
thought
white
bear
owl
carver
said
drily
we
routed
some
drunk
pale
eyes
who
hardly
deserve
to
be
called
long
knives
let
us
not
waste
any
more
of
our
young
men
lives
let
us
follow
the
northward
curve
of
the
rock
river
to
its
very
headwaters
far
beyond
any
pale
eyes
settlements
then
travel
westward
toward
the
great
river
if
we
can
cross
the
great
river
safely
i
do
not
think
the
long
knives
will
chase
us
farther
the
five
men
sat
in
silence
a
sudden
thought
struck
white
bear
was
why
earthmaker
had
ordained
that
he
be
educated
among
the
pale
eyes
so
that
he
could
help
his
band
understand
how
pale
eyes
thought
if
they
kept
going
north
along
the
rock
river
they
would
soon
cross
the
northern
border
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
might
seem
to
them
to
mean
very
little
but
it
could
mean
much
to
their
pursuers
the
country
where
they
were
headed
did
not
belong
to
any
state
it
was
part
of
a
large
land
of
many
waters
that
was
called
the
michigan
territory
eagerly
he
said
we
may
be
able
to
escape
the
long
knives
by
going
north
most
of
the
long
knives
who
are
pursuing
us
were
called
out
by
the
great
father
of
the
illinois
country
once
we
are
out
of
illinois
maybe
they
will
not
follow
wolf
paw
grunted
clearly
insulted
at
the
thought
of
their
not
being
pursued
the
prophet
bestirred
himself
many
of
my
winnebago
brothers
dwell
in
that
country
to
the
north
they
will
join
us
in
fighting
the
long
knives
your
people
from
prophet
town
who
been
deserting
us
white
bear
thought
a
warrior
set
a
long
knives
saddlebag
before
black
hawk
who
opened
it
the
war
chief
pulled
out
an
black
wool
suit
and
some
white
silk
shirts
with
ruffles
finally
he
took
out
two
books
bound
in
red
and
white
leather
white
bear
leaned
over
for
a
closer
look
bundles
of
the
pale
eyes
talking
paper
said
black
hawk
wolf
paw
said
they
are
worthless
father
keep
the
clothing
and
put
the
talking
paper
on
the
fire
but
black
hawk
handed
one
of
the
books
to
white
bear
what
do
the
talking
papers
say
to
you
white
bear
white
bear
picked
up
a
book
and
read
on
the
spine
pleadings
vol
he
opened
and
saw
type
his
eyes
skimming
over
many
legal
terms
in
latin
white
bear
wondered
whether
the
lawyer
who
owned
these
books
was
still
alive
at
the
sight
of
books
his
heart
gave
an
unexpected
lurch
he
felt
a
longing
to
be
not
in
a
plundered
enemy
camp
on
the
prairie
but
in
a
library
with
books
pen
and
paper
the
feeling
took
him
by
surprise
it
had
been
many
months
since
he
had
missed
the
pale
eyes
world
a
few
pages
of
now
and
then
had
satisfied
any
hankering
for
what
they
called
civilization
these
papers
tell
about
the
pale
eyes
laws
he
said
it
is
sometimes
said
that
they
have
no
magic
but
there
is
powerful
magic
in
their
books
and
in
their
laws
it
is
the
magic
that
binds
them
together
the
prophet
said
the
pale
eyes
paper
is
bad
medicine
black
hawk
held
out
his
hand
and
white
bear
gave
him
the
book
it
pained
white
bear
to
think
black
hawk
might
throw
it
into
the
fire
white
bear
had
seen
many
white
leaders
mayors
congressmen
military
officers
once
even
sharp
knife
himself
andrew
jackson
the
president
of
the
united
states
he
had
learned
about
them
in
school
and
read
about
them
in
newspapers
he
felt
black
hawk
was
a
match
for
any
of
them
more
than
a
match
in
some
ways
he
was
stronger
and
healthier
than
any
white
man
his
age
that
white
bear
had
known
what
pale
eyes
of
nearly
seventy
years
could
personally
lead
a
cavalry
charge
against
an
enemy
outnumbering
him
by
ten
to
one
and
rout
them
black
hawk
great
weakness
was
one
that
he
shared
with
most
people
whatever
their
race
or
their
position
in
life
if
he
wanted
a
thing
to
be
true
he
believed
it
that
was
why
last
winter
he
had
listened
to
the
winnebago
prophet
and
not
to
white
bear
now
white
bear
hoped
black
hawk
would
show
his
intelligence
by
respecting
the
value
of
the
book
black
hawk
frowned
at
the
volume
weighing
it
in
his
hand
he
picked
the
other
book
up
with
his
other
hand
they
are
heavy
but
since
there
is
magic
in
them
i
will
keep
these
bundles
by
me
and
i
will
bring
them
with
me
when
i
speak
in
council
white
bear
breathed
a
small
sigh
of
satisfaction
black
hawk
laid
the
books
down
one
on
each
side
of
him
and
put
one
hand
on
each
book
he
sat
like
that
for
a
time
staring
into
the
fire
i
have
done
with
trying
to
surrender
to
the
long
knives
he
said
and
it
seemed
to
white
bear
that
his
face
became
a
fearsome
mask
in
the
firelight
they
have
left
me
no
choice
yes
we
will
retreat
from
them
but
we
will
not
run
like
hunted
deer
we
will
send
out
war
parties
big
and
small
in
every
direction
we
will
lie
in
ambush
on
every
trail
we
will
fall
upon
every
settlement
we
will
attack
every
traveling
party
of
long
knives
no
pale
eyes
north
of
the
rock
river
will
be
safe
from
us
until
we
have
crossed
the
great
river
we
will
give
the
pale
eyes
no
peace
at
black
hawk
words
white
bear
felt
that
an
hand
had
laid
itself
flat
on
his
back
between
his
shoulder
blades
with
those
words
black
hawk
was
condemning
to
cruel
death
hundreds
of
people
pale
eyes
and
his
own
and
one
of
the
largest
settlements
north
of
the
rock
river
was
victor
what
is
the
use
of
more
killing
he
said
it
will
only
madden
the
long
knives
they
will
come
after
us
till
they
have
destroyed
us
i
have
decided
black
hawk
said
we
must
fight
back
we
must
be
avenged
they
stole
our
land
they
burned
saukenuk
they
burned
prophet
town
we
asked
them
for
peace
and
they
killed
us
black
hawk
will
show
them
that
they
can
not
do
this
and
go
unpunished
so
it
shall
be
the
winnebago
prophet
growled
after
that
the
long
knives
in
their
turn
will
have
to
be
hopelessness
lay
like
a
heavy
sodden
blanket
on
white
bear
he
saw
the
old
warrior
determination
and
said
no
more
he
could
only
pray
that
earthmaker
spare
those
he
loved
on
both
sides
black
hawk
stood
up
let
us
go
back
to
our
camp
wolf
paw
said
father
i
want
to
stay
here
till
tomorrow
with
a
party
of
warriors
there
are
dead
long
knives
scattered
all
over
the
prairie
but
we
can
not
find
them
in
the
dark
in
the
morning
we
can
take
their
scalps
and
their
weapons
his
words
stopped
white
bear
as
he
was
about
to
turn
away
from
the
fire
otto
wegner
might
still
be
hiding
in
that
hollow
tree
waiting
for
dawn
hurriedly
white
bear
said
i
too
will
stay
i
will
help
wolf
paw
search
for
the
dead
what
could
he
do
if
wolf
paw
and
his
men
captured
wegner
perhaps
not
save
the
prussian
life
but
at
least
persuade
the
warriors
to
kill
him
cleanly
and
not
torture
him
i
done
enough
for
wegner
i
want
to
go
back
to
but
his
impulses
were
a
shaman
impulses
and
the
harder
to
explain
they
were
the
more
he
trusted
them
it
was
important
for
some
reason
that
he
stay
at
old
man
creek
a
while
longer
owl
carver
looked
surprised
after
all
you
have
suffered
do
you
not
want
to
return
to
your
family
white
bear
thought
quickly
there
is
a
chance
that
murdering
uncle
of
mine
is
one
of
those
lying
on
the
ground
somewhere
around
here
it
would
be
good
to
see
him
dead
owl
carver
grunted
i
will
tell
redbird
that
you
are
safe
fear
and
exertion
had
exhausted
white
bear
beyond
ordinary
fatigue
and
he
had
barely
enough
energy
now
to
roll
himself
in
a
blanket
by
the
small
fire
unconsciousness
hit
him
instantly
in
the
morning
he
watched
sickened
as
wolf
paw
not
only
scalped
a
long
knife
who
lay
dead
in
the
tall
grass
but
slashed
open
the
man
woollen
trousers
and
sliced
off
his
manly
parts
blood
spattered
over
innocent
prairie
flowers
of
violet
and
yellow
and
a
swarm
of
flies
buzzed
around
wolf
paw
waiting
to
settle
on
the
dead
man
when
he
moved
away
why
do
you
do
that
white
bear
demanded
the
sauk
have
never
done
such
things
to
a
dead
enemy
before
the
winnebago
prophet
says
that
the
long
knives
are
planning
to
kill
all
sauk
men
and
then
bring
up
black
men
from
the
country
to
the
south
to
mate
with
our
women
that
way
they
hope
to
breed
a
race
of
slaves
this
is
our
answer
to
that
the
story
sounded
absurd
to
white
bear
the
pale
eyes
in
illinois
even
keep
black
slaves
just
more
of
the
winnebago
prophet
babblings
but
wolf
paw
firmly
believed
it
at
a
sudden
drumming
of
hooves
wolf
paw
and
white
bear
both
looked
south
at
old
man
creek
a
sauk
warrior
splashed
through
waving
his
arm
long
knives
coming
he
shouted
wolf
paw
picked
up
two
rifles
his
own
and
the
dead
man
they
had
found
eleven
bodies
scattered
along
the
edge
of
the
rock
river
none
of
them
raoul
white
bear
was
disappointed
but
not
surprised
that
raoul
had
managed
to
escape
surely
he
deserved
killing
more
than
any
of
his
followers
who
did
die
but
white
bear
had
not
stayed
behind
just
to
see
raoul
dead
in
fact
it
was
a
relief
that
the
spirits
had
not
answered
white
forbidden
prayer
he
kept
looking
for
movement
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
trying
to
see
whether
otto
wegner
was
anywhere
about
but
he
saw
no
sign
of
him
how
many
long
knives
wolf
paw
said
to
the
scout
as
he
rode
up
can
we
fight
them
the
scout
hand
slashed
a
no
too
many
fifty
at
least
all
on
horseback
and
they
have
a
wagon
with
them
coming
to
collect
their
dead
said
wolf
paw
they
will
not
like
what
they
find
he
grinned
down
at
the
corpse
he
had
just
carved
better
mount
up
and
ride
away
from
here
said
the
scout
if
they
see
us
they
will
chase
us
they
will
not
chase
us
said
wolf
paw
they
will
be
afraid
of
an
ambush
his
smile
broadened
maybe
we
will
give
them
one
at
wolf
paw
shouted
command
the
six
warriors
who
had
remained
with
him
moved
into
the
trees
north
of
old
man
creek
the
same
trees
where
white
bear
had
taken
refuge
last
night
white
bear
tried
to
see
the
tree
where
he
had
hidden
wegner
but
the
woods
looked
different
in
daylight
wolf
paw
ordered
his
party
to
mount
their
horses
tied
up
amidst
the
trees
and
ride
north
to
black
hawk
camp
but
though
he
swung
into
the
saddle
he
did
not
ride
off
with
them
he
sat
on
his
gray
pony
facing
the
direction
the
long
knives
would
be
coming
from
a
screen
of
maple
branches
and
wild
grape
vines
concealed
him
white
bear
on
a
brown
mare
captured
in
raoul
camp
last
night
drew
up
beside
him
why
are
you
staying
white
bear
asked
i
counted
only
eleven
dead
long
knives
said
wolf
paw
i
want
to
make
it
twelve
he
put
the
hammer
of
his
flintlock
on
poured
priming
powder
on
the
pan
from
a
small
flask
and
closed
the
fizzen
over
it
white
bear
sensed
that
something
very
important
was
about
to
happen
and
that
he
must
wait
with
wolf
paw
why
do
wait
wolf
paw
demanded
you
have
never
killed
anyone
here
they
come
said
white
bear
choosing
not
to
answer
him
the
two
horses
pulling
the
wagon
a
flatbed
with
railed
sides
halted
at
the
creek
most
of
the
long
knives
dismounted
and
began
to
search
through
the
remains
of
raoul
camp
a
few
others
rode
across
the
creek
wolf
paw
raised
his
rifle
the
long
knives
cried
out
to
one
another
and
cursed
as
they
found
the
mutilated
bodies
of
their
comrades
they
hate
us
the
long
knives
had
blankets
tied
across
their
horses
backs
they
opened
the
blankets
and
used
them
to
pick
up
the
dead
one
pair
of
men
on
foot
was
already
carrying
a
body
across
the
creek
to
the
wagon
one
long
knife
rode
slowly
toward
them
he
was
so
tall
that
his
legs
dangled
down
from
his
horse
almost
to
the
ground
he
came
to
the
body
wolf
paw
had
just
been
stripping
and
climbed
down
he
took
off
his
gray
hat
and
stood
holding
it
in
both
hands
as
he
looked
down
at
the
body
white
bear
heard
the
click
of
a
flintlock
hammer
being
drawn
back
to
wolf
paw
sighted
along
the
barrel
the
militiaman
raised
his
head
and
white
bear
saw
tears
glistening
in
the
morning
sun
as
they
ran
down
his
cheeks
white
bear
knew
this
man
a
gaunt
brown
face
with
strong
bones
gray
eyes
a
young
face
aged
by
grief
in
white
bear
vision
of
last
winter
this
man
had
a
black
beard
now
he
was
but
this
was
the
man
the
turtle
had
shown
him
a
sudden
shout
from
the
woods
made
both
white
bear
and
wolf
paw
jump
with
surprise
help
help
me
please
white
bear
saw
otto
wegner
stagger
from
the
trees
about
a
hundred
feet
to
his
right
he
was
trying
to
run
toward
the
tall
man
he
limped
badly
and
let
out
an
oh
of
pain
with
every
step
the
tall
man
set
his
hat
back
on
his
head
and
ran
toward
the
prussian
who
fell
forward
on
his
face
in
the
grass
a
short
distance
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
wolf
paw
swung
the
rifle
toward
otto
but
before
he
could
fire
otto
fell
and
was
almost
obscured
by
the
tall
grass
the
rifle
barrel
lifted
toward
the
man
going
to
his
aid
white
bear
heard
wolf
paw
draw
a
deep
breath
through
his
nostrils
and
saw
his
finger
tighten
on
the
trigger
even
as
the
hammer
fell
and
the
spark
set
the
powder
sizzling
in
the
pan
white
bear
thrust
his
hand
out
in
the
instant
between
the
pulling
of
the
trigger
and
the
firing
of
the
rifle
white
bear
pushed
the
barrel
off
target
the
rifle
went
off
with
a
boom
and
a
flash
and
a
puff
of
blue
smoke
the
lanky
man
jerked
his
head
around
and
stared
into
the
trees
where
wolf
paw
and
white
bear
sat
hidden
on
their
horses
he
shouted
and
pointed
the
long
knives
spread
out
between
the
creek
and
the
woods
brought
their
rifles
to
their
shoulders
some
of
them
jumped
on
their
horses
did
you
do
that
wolf
paw
shouted
it
no
longer
mattered
that
the
long
knives
could
hear
him
he
raised
his
rifle
as
if
to
hit
white
bear
with
the
butt
end
as
eli
greenglove
had
done
many
moons
ago
come
on
said
white
bear
ignoring
the
threat
and
kicking
his
sides
to
start
him
galloping
through
the
woods
wolf
paw
who
had
no
time
to
reload
thundered
behind
him
uttering
shouts
of
inarticulate
rage
white
bear
was
certain
wolf
paw
would
strike
at
him
with
rifle
butt
or
tomahawk
or
knife
before
they
cleared
the
woods
but
wolf
paw
was
wholly
bent
now
on
escape
i
understand
the
realization
hit
white
bear
so
suddenly
and
surprisingly
that
he
sat
up
in
his
saddle
a
tree
limb
flying
toward
him
nearly
hit
him
in
the
face
he
ducked
under
it
at
the
last
moment
this
was
why
he
had
wanted
to
stay
behind
with
wolf
paw
even
at
the
cost
of
delaying
his
reunion
with
redbird
even
at
the
risk
of
his
life
it
was
not
just
to
protect
otto
wegner
the
turtle
or
perhaps
even
earthmaker
himself
had
ordained
it
if
he
had
not
been
there
wolf
paw
would
have
killed
that
tall
thin
man
who
came
to
bury
his
fallen
comrades
white
bear
remembered
the
rest
of
his
vision
hundreds
of
long
knives
charging
and
dying
would
this
man
send
those
long
knives
or
their
enemy
into
battle
it
was
impossible
to
puzzle
out
he
might
never
know
the
answer
they
rode
over
the
prairie
on
the
other
side
of
the
woods
heading
for
black
hawk
camp
the
long
knives
following
them
had
dropped
away
doubtless
afraid
as
wolf
paw
had
predicted
of
an
ambush
still
expecting
to
feel
a
tomahawk
blade
split
his
spine
white
bear
slowed
down
so
wolf
paw
shouted
you
are
still
a
pale
eyes
no
white
bear
tried
to
explain
it
was
a
vision
i
had
i
had
to
save
that
man
a
vision
wolf
paw
sneered
i
should
kill
you
if
you
were
not
a
shaman
a
warrior
needs
all
his
luck
but
since
your
pale
eyes
people
are
so
precious
to
you
i
will
kill
you
heard
what
my
father
said
i
will
lead
the
war
party
that
goes
to
your
pale
eyes
home
and
this
time
you
will
not
be
along
to
save
anyone
they
spoke
no
more
though
the
morning
sky
was
bright
a
cloud
of
dread
settled
over
white
bear
what
would
become
of
nicole
grandpapa
frank
and
all
the
people
of
victoire
and
victor
who
had
been
his
friends
at
the
prompting
of
some
spirit
he
had
saved
the
tall
thin
man
a
stranger
to
him
and
he
had
saved
otto
wegner
one
of
raoul
hired
men
was
there
he
could
do
for
his
own
loved
ones
the
blockhouse
the
devil
reek
of
gunpowder
seared
nicole
nostrils
arrows
flew
over
the
trading
post
palisade
to
fall
in
the
courtyard
some
quivering
upright
in
the
ground
she
heard
the
piercing
shrieks
of
the
indians
above
the
steady
crackling
of
rifle
fire
she
stood
in
the
open
doorway
of
the
blockhouse
her
body
tense
with
fear
as
she
watched
frank
up
on
the
catwalk
above
the
main
gate
he
crouched
behind
the
pointed
logs
of
the
palisade
frowning
with
concentration
he
was
slowly
reloading
his
rifle
look
at
frank
up
there
nicole
said
to
pamela
russell
who
stood
beside
her
oh
god
i
hate
to
see
him
out
in
the
open
frank
she
said
though
she
knew
he
could
hear
her
get
into
one
of
the
towers
burke
too
pamela
said
why
do
they
do
it
she
pointed
to
the
east
side
of
the
palisade
where
her
husband
a
stocky
man
wearing
spectacles
stood
on
the
catwalk
with
the
indians
attacking
the
front
gate
he
was
left
alone
to
guard
the
east
parapet
the
rest
of
the
men
ten
of
them
were
at
the
front
part
of
the
palisades
banging
away
men
twelve
men
who
know
how
to
use
rifles
that
all
and
four
were
nicole
husband
two
of
her
sons
and
her
father
she
gasped
she
saw
a
loop
of
rope
fly
through
the
air
above
the
eastern
wall
and
catch
on
one
of
the
sharpened
logs
a
moment
later
a
dark
head
crowned
with
feathers
appeared
above
the
palisade
and
burke
russell
was
looking
the
other
way
burke
look
out
pamela
screamed
burke
heard
that
he
swung
around
raising
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
please
god
nicole
cried
the
indian
leaped
over
the
parapet
he
seemed
twice
as
tall
as
burke
with
bulging
muscles
that
gleamed
with
oil
he
wore
only
a
loincloth
and
his
body
was
painted
with
red
yellow
and
black
stripes
his
scalplock
flew
out
behind
him
as
he
rushed
burke
swinging
a
war
club
with
a
glittering
metal
spike
protruding
from
its
thick
end
burke
rifle
went
off
with
an
orange
flash
a
boom
a
cloud
of
smoke
the
indian
was
stopped
the
war
club
came
down
on
burke
head
nicole
heard
the
hollow
thud
and
heard
herself
cry
out
pamela
screamed
oh
no
oh
god
no
burke
burke
burke
glasses
flew
from
his
face
hit
the
catwalk
and
caromed
off
to
the
ground
with
his
free
hand
the
indian
giant
seized
the
rifle
as
burke
crumpled
he
raised
both
arms
over
his
head
rifle
in
one
hand
bloodstained
club
in
the
other
and
shouted
his
triumph
nicole
stomach
heaved
pamela
fell
against
her
fainting
she
threw
an
arm
around
pamela
and
eased
her
to
the
ground
and
she
saw
half
a
dozen
more
indians
waving
rifles
and
tomahawks
leap
over
the
eastern
parapet
and
land
on
the
catwalk
near
burke
russell
body
frank
behind
you
she
screamed
frank
turned
took
aim
and
fired
at
the
indians
he
ran
for
the
nearest
corner
tower
nicole
did
see
whether
he
hit
any
of
the
indians
she
dragged
pamela
out
of
the
doorway
with
the
help
of
ellen
slattery
the
wife
they
got
pamela
sitting
on
a
bench
by
the
wall
her
thick
chestnut
hair
tumbled
forward
as
nicole
pushed
her
head
down
to
revive
her
do
know
why
i
doing
this
it
a
mercy
she
her
heart
in
her
throat
nicole
pushed
herself
to
her
feet
and
ran
back
to
the
door
an
arrow
whizzed
through
the
open
doorway
it
clanged
off
the
iron
muzzle
of
the
cannon
that
stood
in
the
center
of
the
blockhouse
hall
make
a
mighty
big
target
for
those
she
thought
the
wry
little
joke
helping
to
keep
her
from
crying
in
her
terror
she
peered
around
the
edge
of
the
doorway
to
see
a
fury
of
brown
bodies
on
the
southern
catwalk
where
frank
had
been
standing
in
the
center
of
the
catwalk
one
brave
with
a
rooster
comb
of
hair
shouted
and
brandished
a
tomahawk
sending
parties
to
hammer
at
the
doors
of
the
corner
towers
with
clubs
tomahawks
and
rifle
butts
black
rings
painted
around
his
eyes
and
yellow
slashes
on
his
cheekbones
gave
him
a
terrifying
look
even
in
the
midst
of
her
fear
and
hatred
she
could
see
that
his
body
was
magnificent
the
most
beautiful
man
body
she
ever
seen
to
her
relief
nicole
saw
no
dead
white
men
anywhere
except
for
burke
russell
who
lay
still
his
head
a
bright
red
mess
one
arm
hanging
down
over
the
edge
of
the
eastern
catwalk
she
looked
at
him
quickly
and
then
looked
away
feeling
sick
again
what
made
it
even
more
of
a
shame
that
burke
had
died
on
the
palisade
was
that
the
men
never
planned
to
hold
it
they
just
wanted
to
delay
the
indians
a
bit
here
in
the
blockhouse
was
where
they
hoped
to
be
able
to
hold
out
with
god
help
oh
burke
oh
my
burke
pamela
russell
was
awake
and
screaming
ellen
slattery
looked
helplessly
at
nicole
nicole
felt
heartbroken
for
pamela
but
she
had
to
let
her
be
there
was
too
much
to
do
she
ran
through
the
people
crowded
into
the
main
room
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
blockhouse
there
must
be
four
hundred
people
here
mostly
women
and
children
she
thought
raoul
got
over
a
hundred
men
from
victor
with
him
god
knows
here
they
had
more
rifles
than
men
two
dozen
rifles
leaned
against
the
stone
wall
many
families
owned
two
or
three
rifles
and
people
had
grabbed
them
as
they
fled
to
the
trading
post
a
woman
can
ram
a
ball
down
a
muzzle
and
pull
a
trigger
and
miss
she
thought
her
heart
a
ball
of
ice
she
had
seen
one
indian
hit
yet
nicole
spoke
loudly
to
the
women
around
her
the
indians
will
be
shooting
down
from
the
catwalk
at
our
men
when
they
try
to
get
back
here
to
us
she
started
to
load
a
rifle
we
got
to
shoot
at
the
indians
and
drive
them
to
cover
she
had
not
held
a
rifle
in
her
hands
since
marrying
frank
who
would
not
have
a
firearm
in
the
house
but
elysée
de
marion
had
taught
his
daughter
how
to
shoot
and
she
had
not
forgotten
piled
by
the
rifles
were
flannel
bags
powder
horns
and
five
small
barrels
all
full
of
gunpowder
in
that
frantic
dawn
after
fleeing
here
the
men
and
women
had
formed
a
relay
line
to
rush
the
bags
and
barrels
of
gunpowder
from
raoul
stone
magazine
to
the
blockhouse
feeling
a
bit
more
hopeful
nicole
noticed
lead
ingots
lying
beside
the
ammunition
probably
from
the
lead
mine
that
raoul
had
shut
down
just
before
leaving
victor
and
she
saw
bullet
molds
they
had
some
of
the
things
they
needed
if
only
they
knew
how
to
use
these
things
who
knows
how
to
mold
bullets
she
asked
the
group
of
women
who
been
standing
silently
watching
her
i
know
elfrida
wegner
said
of
course
thought
nicole
her
husband
had
been
a
soldier
over
in
europe
take
some
others
and
show
them
how
to
do
it
nicole
said
we
going
to
need
all
the
bullets
we
can
make
elfrida
and
two
other
women
carried
the
lead
bars
and
the
molds
to
the
huge
fireplace
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
from
the
hundred
and
more
women
crowded
into
the
hall
nicole
collected
ten
volunteers
who
knew
something
about
rifles
five
to
shoot
and
five
to
load
she
called
two
of
the
bigger
boys
to
carry
baskets
of
shot
upstairs
but
carrying
powder
that
was
dangerous
she
could
make
herself
ask
anyone
else
to
do
that
she
filled
a
bushel
basket
with
sacks
of
cartridges
added
a
powder
horn
on
top
swung
it
up
to
her
shoulder
and
charged
up
the
stairs
terrified
all
the
way
judas
priest
you
missuz
hopkins
said
one
of
the
boys
carrying
shot
it
gave
her
a
warm
feeling
to
hear
that
she
figured
most
people
thought
of
her
as
just
plain
fat
she
still
could
believe
she
was
going
to
do
this
going
to
try
to
kill
people
she
picked
out
a
slot
in
the
log
wall
and
pushed
her
rifle
barrel
through
it
she
could
see
a
bit
of
the
courtyard
below
white
men
were
falling
back
from
the
towers
indians
were
coming
at
them
all
of
them
were
moving
slowly
white
men
backing
up
a
step
at
a
time
indians
matching
them
step
for
step
a
dance
the
brave
with
the
red
crest
was
still
standing
on
the
catwalk
above
the
front
gate
waving
his
tomahawk
and
shouting
orders
the
caller
nicole
pulled
open
the
drawstring
of
a
bag
of
cartridges
bit
off
the
end
of
a
paper
cartridge
and
poured
the
black
powder
down
the
muzzle
of
her
rifle
she
detached
the
ramrod
from
the
stock
of
the
rifle
and
wrapped
a
bullet
in
greased
cloth
ramming
it
into
place
down
the
tight
rifled
barrel
she
thanked
heaven
she
had
forgotten
how
to
do
this
she
dropped
the
fine
grains
of
priming
powder
from
the
horn
into
the
powder
pan
pointed
her
rifle
at
the
brave
and
sighted
down
the
black
barrel
at
the
center
of
his
chest
her
finger
quivered
on
the
trigger
she
could
kill
a
man
her
eyes
blurred
if
she
did
kill
him
he
might
kill
frank
or
tom
or
ben
or
papa
she
remembered
burke
russell
smashed
bloody
skull
she
had
to
do
it
her
vision
cleared
she
took
deep
breaths
steadying
herself
she
heard
the
click
of
the
hammer
as
she
pulled
back
the
trigger
the
hammer
snapped
forward
the
flint
hit
the
fizzen
the
spark
struck
the
powder
pan
the
rifle
went
off
with
a
thunderclap
that
made
her
ears
ring
and
her
target
was
obscured
by
smoke
in
front
of
the
rifle
port
when
the
smoke
cleared
the
brave
was
still
standing
on
the
catwalk
she
clenched
her
fist
and
whispered
damn
the
indian
glanced
down
to
his
right
as
if
he
had
heard
a
bullet
strike
the
palisade
wall
there
then
looked
straight
at
her
she
knew
he
could
really
see
her
she
was
hidden
behind
a
log
wall
and
a
hundred
feet
or
more
separated
them
even
so
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
malevolent
stare
met
her
eyes
she
handed
her
rifle
back
to
bernadette
bosquet
a
cook
from
the
château
who
gave
her
a
loaded
one
down
in
the
yard
the
indians
were
charging
the
fur
shop
and
the
inn
the
white
men
retreating
were
converging
on
the
front
door
of
the
blockhouse
she
saw
elysée
and
guichard
emerge
from
behind
the
inn
the
two
old
men
moved
slowly
elysée
limping
heavily
both
walking
backward
guichard
fired
a
shot
at
the
six
or
more
crouching
indians
coming
at
them
elysée
his
walking
stick
in
his
left
hand
raised
his
pistol
guichard
worked
quickly
with
powder
horn
and
ramrod
to
load
his
rifle
elysée
fired
bringing
down
one
of
the
indians
both
men
took
a
few
steps
backward
as
powder
smoke
enveloped
their
attackers
the
indians
darted
forward
and
guichard
raised
his
rifle
the
indians
hesitated
elysée
stepped
behind
guichard
and
tucked
his
stick
under
one
arm
to
reload
his
pistol
at
a
word
from
elysée
guichard
fired
and
a
red
man
with
a
rifle
crumpled
guichard
reaching
for
his
powder
horn
stepped
backward
behind
elysée
who
now
kept
the
indians
covered
nicole
felt
her
legs
tremble
and
a
lump
form
in
her
throat
as
she
watched
the
fearless
precision
with
which
her
father
and
his
lifelong
servant
carried
out
their
retreat
those
two
old
men
should
have
to
fight
at
all
but
today
every
man
was
needed
she
saw
frank
and
her
two
oldest
sons
tom
and
ben
running
across
the
yard
to
the
front
door
they
vanished
under
the
overhang
of
the
blockhouse
second
story
made
of
logs
thank
god
they
made
it
to
safety
she
felt
faint
and
took
a
deep
breath
she
handed
her
rifle
to
bernadette
here
you
shoot
i
got
to
see
my
husband
and
sons
merci
madame
i
thought
you
never
give
me
a
turn
by
the
time
nicole
got
downstairs
frank
and
the
other
men
had
crowded
into
the
hall
the
heavy
front
door
of
the
blockhouse
was
shut
and
barred
throwing
the
lower
floor
into
two
men
were
shooting
through
the
rifle
ports
on
either
side
of
the
door
women
were
lighting
oil
lamps
and
candles
and
setting
them
on
shelves
around
the
edges
of
the
room
women
whose
men
were
here
were
holding
them
tight
nicole
threw
her
arms
around
frank
then
opened
them
wider
to
take
in
tom
and
ben
as
they
ran
to
join
their
mother
and
father
she
eyed
the
boys
their
faces
were
rosy
and
their
eyes
bright
with
excitement
they
be
men
in
another
year
or
two
and
after
today
she
thought
frank
would
have
a
hard
time
keeping
them
away
from
rifles
we
live
through
this
as
she
felt
frank
strong
and
alive
against
her
a
sudden
intense
desire
to
make
love
to
him
came
over
her
she
was
shocked
at
herself
but
she
seen
one
man
struck
down
already
and
knew
that
before
sundown
she
or
frank
might
be
dead
the
realization
of
how
precious
frank
was
to
her
had
brought
her
body
to
passionate
life
she
heard
the
shrieks
and
yips
of
the
indians
in
the
yard
of
the
trading
post
david
cooper
said
we
ca
hold
off
just
shooting
from
the
ground
floor
we
need
shooters
at
every
rifle
port
upstairs
he
nodded
approvingly
when
he
saw
elfrida
wegner
and
three
other
women
molding
bullets
by
the
fire
they
had
just
kindled
he
called
all
right
four
men
and
four
of
you
women
take
rifle
ports
down
here
the
rest
of
you
come
up
to
the
second
story
gathering
up
extra
rifles
five
men
and
thirty
or
more
women
followed
cooper
upstairs
where
he
organized
them
to
shoot
each
shooter
to
have
someone
to
reload
and
carry
ammunition
nicole
might
herself
have
volunteered
to
shoot
through
one
of
the
upstairs
rifle
ports
but
she
chose
to
load
for
frank
she
felt
it
might
be
important
to
frank
that
he
be
the
one
to
shoot
and
she
stand
by
helping
him
she
would
rather
be
at
his
side
anyway
than
across
the
room
somewhere
shooting
frank
pushed
his
octagonal
rifle
barrel
out
through
his
port
the
port
was
only
about
six
inches
wide
and
three
inches
high
and
the
log
wall
was
a
foot
thick
or
more
but
nicole
still
trembled
at
the
thought
that
an
indian
might
manage
to
hit
frank
with
an
arrow
or
a
bullet
working
to
load
his
second
rifle
she
tried
not
to
think
about
that
thank
god
they
had
david
cooper
here
someone
who
seemed
to
know
what
to
do
she
remembered
how
cooper
had
spoken
up
the
day
raoul
had
forced
auguste
out
of
the
château
this
how
you
do
things
in
smith
county
it
was
cooper
who
had
thrown
open
the
trading
post
to
the
first
refugees
from
the
indian
raid
people
from
victoire
shortly
after
dawn
he
and
burke
russell
burke
her
heart
sank
nicole
fears
turned
to
victoire
and
to
the
outlying
farms
the
indians
had
attacked
so
suddenly
whooping
on
horseback
across
the
prairie
that
there
was
just
time
for
the
people
in
victor
and
some
from
the
château
to
crowd
into
the
trading
post
many
of
the
children
and
some
of
the
women
gathered
into
the
main
room
were
still
in
their
nightgowns
but
missing
from
the
crowd
downstairs
were
people
nicole
knew
reverend
philip
hale
and
nancy
hale
clarissa
greenglove
and
her
two
sons
by
raoul
marchette
perrault
many
others
fear
twisted
her
belly
as
she
thought
of
what
the
indians
might
have
done
to
them
cooper
had
assigned
himself
to
a
gunport
in
the
east
wall
of
the
blockhouse
nicole
went
to
him
cooper
could
i
have
a
look
out
there
certainly
he
sighed
that
used
to
be
your
home
that
mansion
on
the
hill
did
it
poor
burke
russell
she
saw
was
still
lying
on
the
eastern
catwalk
three
dead
indians
were
sprawled
there
now
to
keep
him
company
though
she
was
a
bit
more
hardened
to
such
sights
than
she
had
been
just
a
short
time
ago
but
what
she
saw
in
the
cheerful
june
sky
beyond
the
palisade
made
her
body
go
with
horror
a
rope
of
thick
black
smoke
coiled
upward
twisting
this
way
and
that
spreading
till
it
seemed
to
stain
the
entire
eastern
quarter
of
the
sky
the
palisade
was
too
high
for
her
to
see
the
fire
itself
though
red
tongues
of
flame
shot
up
now
and
again
in
the
midst
of
the
smoke
but
she
had
no
doubt
at
all
about
where
the
fire
was
they
burning
victoire
she
started
to
cry
she
felt
frank
hand
patting
her
shoulder
and
turned
i
was
hoping
the
people
of
victoire
might
be
able
to
hold
out
she
said
frank
put
his
arm
around
her
nicole
i
sorry
it
pretty
likely
the
only
people
left
alive
from
victoire
are
already
here
lucky
most
of
them
could
outrun
the
indians
and
get
here
but
frank
what
happened
to
the
rest
of
them
marchette
clarissa
are
they
all
dead
frank
did
answer
he
just
stood
there
holding
her
grief
weighed
on
her
like
a
cloak
of
iron
if
she
had
had
frank
to
lean
against
she
would
surely
have
fallen
to
the
floor
she
looked
out
again
and
saw
other
more
distant
columns
of
smoke
the
indians
must
have
come
from
the
east
and
struck
every
farmhouse
they
came
across
they
had
surely
destroyed
philip
hale
church
poor
nancy
david
cooper
said
sometimes
people
manage
to
hide
the
indians
look
everywhere
the
weight
on
her
back
and
shoulders
seemed
to
lighten
with
that
thought
yes
the
lead
mine
for
instance
frank
said
a
perfect
place
oh
they
ca
have
killed
all
those
people
nicole
said
let
marchette
and
clarissa
and
nancy
and
reverend
hale
be
she
desperately
wanted
to
pray
she
wanted
to
believe
that
a
loving
god
was
looking
down
on
victoire
and
victor
protecting
her
friends
and
the
people
she
had
grown
up
with
for
the
next
hour
or
more
nicole
thought
of
nothing
and
did
nothing
but
bite
cartridges
and
dump
powder
ram
home
bullets
put
one
rifle
into
frank
hands
take
the
other
rifle
and
load
it
her
mouth
was
sore
from
biting
the
heavy
paper
her
arms
and
hands
ached
from
making
the
same
movements
over
and
over
the
incessant
shooting
all
around
her
deafened
her
the
stink
and
worse
the
taste
of
gunpowder
turned
her
stomach
and
her
hands
were
blacker
with
the
stuff
than
frank
ever
were
from
his
printing
press
frank
was
firing
less
and
less
often
he
leaned
against
the
log
wall
wiping
his
arm
across
his
forehead
we
kept
pouring
lead
into
the
courtyard
that
driven
them
under
cover
but
they
broke
holes
in
the
corner
tower
walls
and
shooting
back
at
us
from
there
an
indian
yelp
caught
his
attention
and
he
peered
out
again
now
would
you
look
at
that
he
said
nicole
put
her
head
next
to
his
at
the
rifle
port
a
blizzard
in
the
trading
post
courtyard
flecks
of
white
filled
the
air
between
the
inn
and
the
blockhouse
she
saw
brown
arms
shaking
slashed
mattresses
and
pillows
out
the
windows
feathers
floated
up
to
the
gunport
more
feathers
slowly
drifted
down
to
dot
the
fresh
june
grass
with
white
she
heard
yells
and
laughter
from
the
inn
cut
me
open
as
soon
as
they
cut
open
a
pillow
and
think
that
was
just
as
they
getting
drunk
frank
said
on
all
the
liquor
in
tavern
must
be
looting
the
town
too
burn
our
home
everything
will
be
gone
the
beds
and
the
dishes
the
mirrors
the
bureaus
the
spinning
wheel
the
clock
the
plates
and
silverware
our
clothes
our
books
and
old
letters
children
toys
the
spices
the
cradle
i
rocked
all
our
babies
in
the
machines
and
carpentry
tools
and
oh
please
god
not
frank
printing
press
it
nicole
you
blessed
blessed
that
they
attacked
at
dawn
when
all
the
children
were
in
the
house
and
not
scattered
all
over
the
countryside
and
now
they
safely
in
here
blessed
that
your
husband
is
standing
here
beside
you
and
not
dead
on
the
palisade
parapet
like
burke
but
even
as
she
thought
of
things
to
be
thankful
for
she
remembered
what
might
happen
to
them
in
the
next
few
hours
an
indian
charged
out
of
the
front
door
of
the
inn
he
was
waving
a
curving
navy
cutlass
he
ran
at
the
blockhouse
screaming
his
steps
wavered
though
and
nicole
guessed
he
must
be
full
of
whiskey
still
she
was
terrified
what
if
everyone
missed
him
and
he
somehow
got
in
and
others
followed
look
out
frank
said
and
gently
nudged
her
away
from
the
port
he
pushed
his
rifle
out
and
fired
i
hit
him
but
he
is
falling
getting
back
into
the
routine
nicole
took
frank
rifle
and
loaded
it
rifles
were
booming
all
along
the
front
of
the
blockhouse
as
men
tried
to
stop
the
indian
with
the
cutlass
frank
second
rifle
went
off
he
does
want
to
die
said
frank
he
full
of
bullets
she
heard
pain
in
his
voice
and
as
she
handed
him
his
freshly
loaded
rifle
nicole
saw
that
his
upper
lip
was
beaded
with
sweat
she
hurt
for
him
he
hated
killing
and
now
he
was
forced
to
try
again
and
again
to
kill
this
man
frank
aimed
and
fired
again
there
i
got
him
he
down
frank
pulled
his
rifle
in
and
handed
it
to
nicole
as
she
started
to
reload
it
he
leaned
against
the
wall
slowly
his
knees
bent
and
he
slid
down
till
he
was
sitting
on
the
floor
she
put
the
rifle
down
and
crouched
beside
him
stroking
his
arm
her
heart
aching
he
covered
his
mouth
with
his
hand
his
body
jerked
but
he
managed
to
hold
in
the
vomit
after
a
moment
breathing
heavily
he
took
his
hand
away
from
his
mouth
oh
jesus
what
am
i
doing
nicole
put
her
arms
around
him
and
his
head
fell
against
her
breast
excuse
me
miz
hopkins
said
a
voice
above
her
she
let
go
of
frank
as
david
cooper
squatted
down
beside
them
and
laid
his
hand
on
knee
hopkins
you
all
right
i
was
with
harrison
at
tippecanoe
village
and
when
the
indians
came
at
us
out
of
the
woods
i
do
believe
more
than
half
the
men
fired
their
rifles
there
really
few
men
find
it
easy
to
kill
there
times
we
got
to
frank
wiped
his
eyes
and
laid
a
hand
on
top
of
cooper
thanks
cooper
said
if
you
still
feel
bad
just
think
about
what
they
do
to
your
wife
and
kids
if
they
got
in
here
frank
put
a
hand
on
the
floor
and
pushed
himself
to
his
feet
yes
as
long
as
i
think
about
my
family
i
be
able
to
shoot
there
was
a
bitterness
in
his
voice
and
nicole
felt
she
knew
what
he
was
thinking
how
cruel
the
irony
that
love
for
his
family
could
make
him
into
a
killer
here
they
come
again
a
woman
down
the
line
shouted
again
and
again
nicole
heard
the
rapping
of
bullets
into
the
log
wall
near
frank
head
as
he
fired
steadily
at
indians
charging
from
the
trading
post
buildings
they
had
captured
frank
turned
from
the
rifle
port
to
hand
nicole
an
empty
rifle
and
take
a
loaded
one
an
arrow
flashed
through
the
narrow
opening
missing
his
head
by
inches
you
god
the
defenders
kept
up
a
steady
fire
until
the
indians
withdrew
again
into
the
captured
buildings
nicole
and
frank
took
turns
watching
through
the
rifle
port
what
was
happening
to
their
home
at
this
moment
the
lull
stretched
on
nicole
went
downstairs
to
look
for
her
children
began
picking
her
way
through
the
crowd
sitting
on
the
floor
of
the
blockhouse
hall
stretched
out
on
a
bench
was
a
woman
whose
name
she
did
know
a
newcomer
to
the
settlement
the
right
side
of
her
checkered
dress
was
soaked
with
blood
from
shoulder
to
waist
moaning
faintly
the
woman
seemed
half
conscious
arrow
said
ellen
slattery
who
was
pressing
a
folded
cloth
against
the
woman
shoulder
nicole
shuddered
and
patted
ellen
back
and
went
on
she
saw
tom
and
ben
manning
gunports
abigail
martha
and
john
were
playing
around
the
cannon
pretending
to
shoot
it
at
the
indians
the
three
youngest
rachel
betsy
and
patrick
were
with
a
group
gathered
in
the
rear
room
raoul
used
as
his
office
they
were
singing
hymns
pamela
russell
she
saw
was
also
with
the
hymn
singers
tears
running
down
her
face
as
nicole
went
over
to
the
fireplace
to
join
the
women
molding
bullets
she
heard
my
god
how
many
are
my
fears
how
fast
my
foes
increase
their
number
how
it
multiplies
how
fatal
to
my
peace
must
be
the
first
those
have
ever
heard
a
nicole
took
a
turn
at
bullet
making
ladling
the
silvery
molten
lead
from
a
kettle
over
the
fire
into
the
tiny
hole
in
the
mold
opening
the
mold
with
its
scissor
handles
and
dropping
the
ball
into
a
big
basket
another
woman
took
each
ball
and
filed
away
the
bit
of
waste
metal
formed
in
the
hole
through
which
the
lead
was
poured
injuns
a
man
yelled
the
women
and
children
crouched
down
on
the
floor
and
nicole
hurried
upstairs
to
help
frank
after
rifle
fire
from
both
levels
drove
back
the
latest
assault
frank
said
we
get
a
few
each
time
they
attack
but
it
not
enough
i
sure
i
saw
over
a
hundred
of
them
when
i
was
on
the
parapet
we
no
food
and
very
little
water
said
nicole
they
could
just
wait
us
out
and
we
would
last
very
long
the
only
water
they
had
was
in
buckets
the
townspeople
had
brought
into
the
blockhouse
with
them
david
cooper
said
we
got
to
be
ready
for
them
to
make
one
big
rush
for
the
blockhouse
they
try
to
set
the
place
on
fire
so
we
better
save
as
much
water
as
we
can
ration
it
out
nicole
body
broke
out
in
a
cold
sweat
at
the
thought
of
fire
she
remembered
all
the
gunpowder
they
relayed
into
the
blockhouse
to
blow
us
all
and
then
she
remembered
too
what
had
happened
to
helene
twenty
years
ago
at
fort
dearborn
being
blown
to
bits
would
be
a
better
way
to
and
here
just
the
man
to
take
charge
of
rationing
the
water
said
cooper
nicole
turned
to
see
her
father
climbing
up
the
stairs
pulling
himself
along
on
the
banister
and
leaning
on
his
walking
stick
as
he
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
frank
took
his
arm
and
helped
him
over
to
sit
on
a
wooden
box
near
the
rifle
port
elysée
said
one
of
the
women
russell
insisted
on
taking
my
rifle
and
standing
guard
in
my
place
i
will
be
just
as
happy
not
to
have
to
fire
at
any
red
men
for
a
while
i
keep
thinking
i
might
shoot
auguste
nicole
gasped
auguste
papa
he
would
never
be
out
there
perhaps
not
have
you
spoken
to
anyone
who
had
news
of
my
grandchildren
elysée
asked
her
nicole
was
about
to
say
they
all
here
when
she
realized
whom
he
meant
raoul
and
clarissa
children
she
shook
her
head
sadly
no
papa
anyone
from
victoire
who
is
here
we
do
know
what
happened
to
them
elysée
sighed
poor
little
things
in
all
the
years
since
they
were
born
i
got
to
speak
to
them
only
once
or
twice
the
cry
of
here
the
injuns
come
broke
in
on
them
again
david
cooper
gave
elysée
brief
instructions
on
rationing
water
and
the
old
man
limped
downstairs
as
the
firing
began
again
nicole
loading
and
reloading
frank
rifles
with
numb
arms
and
mind
heard
firing
from
all
around
her
the
indians
were
coming
from
every
direction
arrows
and
an
occasional
bullet
whistled
in
through
the
ports
but
no
one
was
hit
smoke
drifted
through
the
second
story
of
the
blockhouse
making
her
eyes
water
the
indians
withdrew
again
as
the
firing
died
down
nicole
was
thankful
to
see
that
the
powder
smoke
that
had
filled
the
second
floor
blew
up
toward
the
roof
and
vanished
looking
up
she
saw
that
there
was
a
space
nearly
a
foot
high
between
the
top
of
the
log
wall
and
the
roof
the
roof
rested
on
big
vertical
timbers
its
overhang
covering
the
opening
men
could
climb
up
there
she
supposed
and
shoot
down
the
attackers
would
have
to
be
standing
directly
below
them
to
shoot
back
there
was
a
heap
she
did
know
about
this
fort
in
the
years
since
raoul
had
built
it
she
hardly
ever
had
reason
to
set
foot
inside
the
last
time
was
when
she
and
frank
had
appealed
to
him
to
leave
men
behind
to
protect
the
town
now
her
life
depended
on
how
well
raoul
had
built
it
and
it
was
bitter
medicine
to
swallow
david
cooper
left
his
rifle
port
to
talk
to
frank
it
only
a
few
hours
till
sunset
cooper
said
in
a
low
voice
and
i
have
a
hunch
they
try
one
big
attack
to
take
this
place
before
dark
if
they
come
all
at
once
we
do
have
enough
rifles
to
stop
them
his
tone
was
but
his
words
struck
terror
into
heart
she
took
frank
hand
and
squeezed
it
it
felt
cold
as
a
dead
man
cooper
went
on
i
keep
thinking
about
that
cannon
downstairs
you
know
whatever
we
might
say
about
raoul
de
marion
he
did
set
this
place
up
to
be
defended
i
figure
that
cannon
must
be
in
working
order
do
you
know
how
to
fire
a
cannon
frank
asked
cooper
shrugged
i
stood
near
the
artillerymen
a
time
or
two
and
watched
them
but
never
thought
to
memorize
what
i
saw
i
could
even
say
how
much
gunpowder
to
use
if
we
put
in
too
little
we
waste
our
chance
if
we
put
in
too
much
we
could
blow
ourselves
all
to
hell
nicole
said
i
rather
that
than
face
whatever
hell
the
indians
have
in
store
for
us
cooper
looked
at
her
with
his
hard
eyes
and
nodded
indians
wo
get
you
miz
hopkins
i
promise
you
that
let
go
take
a
look
at
that
thing
frank
cooper
and
nicole
chilled
but
grimly
reassured
by
remark
cleared
away
the
children
who
were
straddling
the
black
barrel
and
the
women
who
were
sitting
against
its
wooden
carriage
cooper
stood
frowning
at
the
gun
he
sighed
and
it
sounded
to
nicole
like
the
sigh
of
a
man
about
to
step
off
a
high
cliff
well
let
load
up
he
went
over
to
the
side
of
the
room
where
the
flannel
bags
of
gunpowder
were
piled
up
and
he
picked
one
up
holding
it
at
arm
length
as
if
it
were
a
rattlesnake
he
carried
it
back
to
the
cannon
and
slid
it
into
the
muzzle
from
the
carriage
he
unstrapped
the
ramrod
a
pole
with
a
wad
of
cloth
wrapped
around
its
end
and
used
that
to
push
the
gunpowder
down
let
add
another
bag
of
powder
he
said
to
frank
women
and
children
formed
a
circle
to
watch
nicole
pictured
what
the
cannon
would
do
to
all
the
people
in
this
room
if
it
blew
up
and
shut
her
eyes
after
pushing
a
second
bag
of
gunpowder
down
the
muzzle
cooper
said
what
we
need
now
is
canister
shot
that
spread
all
over
the
place
and
puncture
a
lot
of
indians
i
remember
there
was
canister
shot
in
the
powder
magazine
but
it
did
seem
all
that
important
this
morning
and
we
did
have
time
to
move
it
over
here
now
we
have
to
make
do
with
what
we
got
give
me
a
load
of
rifle
bullets
someone
handed
him
a
basket
full
of
lead
balls
and
he
poured
them
into
the
cannon
throat
and
pushed
them
down
with
the
ramrod
i
do
want
to
use
up
all
our
rifle
shot
but
seems
to
me
there
room
inside
this
thing
for
a
lot
more
he
turned
to
the
onlookers
everybody
spread
out
and
bring
me
anything
made
of
metal
that
fit
in
here
into
the
cannon
maw
went
two
chains
a
padlock
a
handful
of
knives
and
forks
and
a
dozen
lead
soldiers
sent
to
war
by
the
small
boys
who
owned
them
here
cooper
use
these
pamela
russell
pushed
her
way
through
the
crowd
holding
out
a
canvas
bag
her
eyes
were
bloodshot
the
lids
swollen
and
red
cooper
frowned
what
that
a
bag
of
pieces
of
eight
from
raoul
de
marion
safe
when
burke
knew
he
was
going
to
be
in
the
fighting
he
gave
me
the
trading
post
keys
to
hold
for
him
she
stopped
and
choking
then
continued
burke
did
know
anything
about
fighting
indians
my
husband
is
dead
because
de
marion
left
us
almost
defenseless
he
does
deserve
to
have
this
silver
feeling
pamela
agony
nicole
went
over
to
her
and
put
an
arm
around
her
back
and
hugged
her
pamela
body
was
stiff
unresponsive
cooper
gaze
traveled
over
the
people
gathered
around
the
cannon
any
of
you
folks
see
anything
wrong
with
us
doing
this
we
always
use
spanish
dollars
out
here
on
the
frontier
said
elysée
with
a
smile
the
government
simply
did
mint
enough
coins
sure
the
indians
will
accept
them
well
that
defense
will
do
for
now
said
cooper
grinning
as
he
slit
the
bag
with
his
hunting
knife
and
poured
the
glittering
silver
disks
into
the
cannon
going
to
make
some
indians
rich
today
he
said
now
we
need
something
to
touch
it
off
with
i
do
see
any
linstock
around
here
a
candle
frank
found
a
long
white
candle
that
would
burn
for
about
an
hour
and
lit
it
from
another
one
mounted
on
a
wall
should
work
said
cooper
keep
a
lighted
candle
by
the
cannon
at
all
times
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
when
they
decide
to
make
their
big
attack
pamela
russell
pulled
free
of
nicole
and
gripped
cooper
arm
let
me
touch
off
the
cannon
she
said
there
was
something
frightening
nicole
thought
in
the
avid
light
in
her
eyes
that
how
i
be
if
frank
were
killed
nicole
wondered
utterly
vengeful
cooper
said
sure
you
can
do
it
pamela
whispered
through
tight
lips
oh
yes
yes
i
am
all
right
said
cooper
you
can
touch
it
off
but
look
out
the
indians
do
shoot
you
when
we
swing
the
door
open
frank
cooper
and
two
more
men
kicked
the
chocks
out
from
under
the
cannon
four
wooden
wheels
the
men
strained
against
the
gun
and
for
a
moment
nicole
was
afraid
they
would
be
able
to
move
it
then
grudgingly
it
rumbled
over
the
puncheon
floor
until
cooper
set
the
four
chocks
back
under
the
wheels
the
cannon
rested
just
a
few
feet
back
from
the
front
door
looking
through
a
port
on
the
west
side
of
the
hall
nicole
saw
the
sun
still
high
in
the
west
this
was
the
month
when
days
were
longest
this
has
been
the
longest
day
of
my
she
thought
as
the
afternoon
passed
with
agonizing
slowness
pamela
russell
had
to
light
yet
a
second
candle
and
then
a
third
she
sat
rigid
in
a
chair
beside
the
cannon
holding
her
candle
upright
saying
nothing
staring
fixedly
at
the
blockhouse
door
nicole
noticed
a
beam
of
sunlight
from
a
rifle
port
lighting
up
the
smoke
and
dust
that
drifted
through
the
main
hall
of
the
blockhouse
the
shaft
of
light
looked
like
a
solid
bar
of
gold
she
looked
through
the
rifle
port
and
was
almost
blinded
by
the
sun
just
above
the
humped
silhouettes
of
hills
across
the
mississippi
she
heard
the
indians
screaming
and
her
stomach
turned
over
fire
arrows
someone
yelled
nicole
heart
stopped
if
the
indians
managed
to
set
fire
to
the
blockhouse
the
hundreds
of
people
who
had
taken
shelter
here
would
be
driven
out
to
be
slaughtered
she
ran
to
the
slot
in
the
stone
wall
where
tom
was
standing
with
his
rifle
ready
looking
past
her
son
head
she
saw
an
arrow
with
a
burning
tip
arc
up
from
the
courtyard
it
disappeared
and
she
thought
it
must
have
hit
the
log
wall
somewhere
above
her
upstairs
cooper
shouted
fill
your
buckets
from
the
water
barrels
and
come
on
his
sweeping
finger
included
a
bunch
of
excited
smaller
boys
who
followed
him
up
the
stairs
nicole
hurried
after
them
cooper
and
the
other
men
boosted
boys
with
buckets
to
the
top
of
the
log
walls
the
boys
pulled
themselves
up
to
the
open
space
nicole
had
noticed
before
under
the
overhang
of
the
roof
leaning
out
sheltered
the
boys
were
able
to
see
where
the
fire
arrows
had
stuck
and
dumped
water
on
them
cooper
grinned
de
marion
built
well
the
ground
floor
stone
and
the
roof
is
covered
with
sheet
lead
injuns
soon
tire
of
this
game
the
fire
arrows
became
fewer
they
stopped
coming
and
there
was
a
breathless
silence
in
which
time
did
not
seem
to
pass
then
cooper
led
the
way
back
down
to
the
ground
floor
indians
whoops
sent
a
new
chill
through
nicole
a
rifle
went
off
tom
at
the
gunport
to
the
left
of
the
front
door
hold
your
fire
boy
cooper
called
watching
from
the
other
side
of
the
doorway
let
them
come
nicole
went
to
stand
beside
her
oldest
son
again
and
look
out
the
front
gate
of
the
palisade
was
open
and
indians
were
streaming
in
brown
bodies
painted
with
yellow
and
red
and
black
slashes
arms
waving
knives
clubs
tomahawks
bows
and
arrows
rifles
more
were
tumbling
out
the
front
door
of
the
inn
a
flicker
of
red
light
caught
her
eye
flames
shot
out
the
open
front
door
of
the
fur
shop
they
were
burning
all
those
valuable
pelts
raoul
would
lose
a
lot
today
and
not
just
money
she
thought
recalling
burning
victoire
money
would
be
the
least
of
raoul
loss
to
her
surprise
she
felt
a
moment
sorrow
for
the
brother
she
had
come
to
despise
twenty
or
more
indians
came
through
the
gate
carrying
a
huge
black
log
its
front
end
afire
the
rest
of
the
indians
gathered
around
them
all
together
they
ran
at
the
blockhouse
door
the
glowing
smoking
tip
of
the
log
in
the
forefront
everybody
get
as
far
away
from
this
damned
cannon
as
you
can
frank
shouted
people
scrambled
away
leaving
an
empty
space
around
the
in
the
center
of
the
floor
some
ran
into
the
strong
room
and
some
scurried
upstairs
only
cooper
frank
and
pamela
russell
stood
by
the
cannon
nicole
stayed
where
she
was
moving
her
body
so
that
she
was
between
tom
and
the
cannon
happens
will
be
what
god
wants
to
open
the
door
cooper
ordered
tom
slattery
the
blacksmith
swung
the
door
open
and
nicole
saw
some
of
the
indians
hesitate
then
rush
forward
she
wondered
if
they
could
see
the
cannon
in
the
shadowy
interior
of
the
blockhouse
shoot
yelled
cooper
carefully
deliberately
pamela
russell
lowered
her
candle
to
the
cannon
touchhole
fire
in
the
hole
cooper
called
out
nicole
heard
the
sizzle
of
gunpowder
from
where
she
stood
the
boom
of
the
cannon
hit
nicole
skull
like
a
mallet
a
huge
white
cloud
belched
out
through
the
open
door
and
the
sharp
reek
of
burnt
powder
filled
the
air
the
gun
jumped
right
over
the
chocks
set
behind
its
wheels
and
flew
back
about
six
feet
in
the
aftermath
of
the
cannon
roar
came
whoops
of
delight
from
nearly
a
hundred
small
boys
in
the
blockhouse
then
nicole
heard
the
indians
screaming
again
but
now
they
were
screams
of
agony
not
war
cries
a
fierce
joy
rose
in
her
as
she
stood
in
the
open
doorway
and
saw
the
yard
of
the
trading
post
transformed
into
a
vision
of
hell
through
the
haze
she
saw
dark
bodies
sprawling
on
the
ground
some
of
the
indians
writhed
in
the
dust
of
the
yard
some
were
motionless
others
were
frantically
pulling
the
fallen
back
dragging
them
by
the
arms
or
legs
the
log
they
were
going
to
use
to
batter
down
the
door
lay
smouldering
abandoned
in
the
yard
of
the
trading
post
as
she
took
in
more
of
the
sight
of
blood
and
torn
bodies
and
severed
limbs
nicole
felt
ashamed
that
she
had
rejoiced
at
first
sickened
she
turned
away
fire
your
rifles
david
cooper
yelled
shoot
shoot
shoot
keep
them
on
the
run
and
shut
that
damned
door
let
me
at
the
port
maw
tom
demanded
the
rifles
banged
away
sounding
puny
in
nicole
ears
after
the
roar
of
the
cannon
finally
cooper
ordered
an
end
to
the
shooting
if
we
let
drag
their
dead
out
of
here
they
may
be
in
a
mood
to
leave
nicole
waited
in
dread
wondering
whether
the
indians
would
come
again
the
sunset
rays
pouring
through
the
ports
on
the
west
side
of
the
blockhouse
slowly
faded
leaving
the
main
room
dark
people
lit
more
candles
david
cooper
directed
the
reloading
of
the
cannon
the
group
in
raoul
office
were
singing
hymns
again
and
many
people
sitting
around
the
hall
joined
them
nicole
sat
beside
pamela
russell
on
a
bench
and
took
her
hand
and
soon
pamela
began
to
talk
quietly
she
told
nicole
things
about
burke
the
books
he
enjoyed
reading
his
favorite
dishes
jokes
he
used
to
tell
her
i
always
envied
you
nicole
with
so
many
children
we
wanted
children
so
much
and
we
never
got
any
and
now
we
never
nicole
tried
to
think
of
something
to
say
but
everything
that
came
to
her
sounded
foolish
to
her
mind
ear
looking
at
frank
standing
by
a
port
she
thought
have
been
blessed
and
pamela
has
been
but
why
that
had
to
mean
something
she
could
think
what
it
helps
me
when
life
is
hard
to
believe
that
god
has
a
plan
she
said
patting
pamela
hand
his
plan
is
like
a
painting
that
so
big
we
can
only
see
dark
spots
or
bright
spots
without
knowing
what
it
all
means
but
i
think
one
day
he
take
us
up
with
him
where
we
can
see
the
whole
picture
and
understand
it
nicole
frank
called
she
gave
pamela
hand
a
squeeze
and
went
to
see
what
frank
was
looking
at
through
the
rifle
port
even
at
this
distance
she
could
hear
the
roaring
of
the
flames
sparks
shot
up
past
the
palisade
and
a
red
glow
filled
the
sky
they
burning
the
town
he
said
our
home
is
gone
our
shop
she
turned
back
to
see
pamela
sitting
on
the
bench
a
lost
look
on
her
pale
face
she
thought
of
the
people
who
had
not
managed
to
reach
the
shelter
of
the
trading
post
she
put
her
arm
around
frank
waist
and
pressed
herself
against
him
you
and
i
are
alive
and
all
of
our
children
are
alive
she
said
god
has
blessed
us
yellow
hair
wolf
paw
has
come
back
white
bear
felt
a
hollow
in
his
stomach
as
the
cry
ran
through
the
camp
wolf
paw
had
vowed
to
bring
death
and
destruction
to
the
pale
eyes
such
as
they
had
never
known
before
before
he
left
wolf
paw
had
held
a
ritual
dog
feast
to
insure
success
he
had
hung
one
of
his
own
dogs
from
a
painted
pole
by
its
hind
legs
and
disemboweled
it
alive
asking
earthmaker
blessing
on
the
war
party
then
his
wives
running
deer
and
burning
pine
had
cooked
the
dog
and
served
bits
of
the
meat
to
the
braves
and
warriors
who
would
follow
wolf
paw
on
this
raid
if
he
would
choose
one
of
his
cherished
dogs
to
be
sacrificed
what
would
he
do
to
the
people
of
victor
for
days
white
bear
had
held
himself
rigid
hardly
able
to
eat
lying
awake
at
night
waiting
for
wolf
paw
war
party
to
come
back
what
horrors
would
he
have
to
face
now
women
and
children
ran
to
surround
the
returning
braves
and
warriors
white
bear
saw
iron
knife
on
horseback
towering
above
the
crowd
his
huge
arms
lifted
triumphantly
from
each
fist
dangled
a
scalp
beside
him
was
wolf
paw
a
blue
cloth
stained
red
with
blood
wrapped
around
his
left
shoulder
wolf
paw
right
hand
was
raised
high
gripping
three
long
hanks
of
hair
with
disks
of
white
flesh
hanging
from
them
more
braves
rode
behind
them
also
holding
up
scalps

white
bear
staggered
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
them
the
hair
was
of
many
different
colors
light
brown
gray
dark
brown
black
some
of
the
locks
were
very
long
and
must
have
been
taken
from
women
heads
could
wolf
paw
be
holding
nicole
hair
or
frank
could
it
be
grandpapa
heart
pounding
white
bear
forced
himself
to
push
through
the
crowd
he
heard
cattle
lowing
and
horses
neighing
in
the
distance
questioning
shouts
and
cries
of
greeting
a
scream
of
agony
froze
him
a
woman
voice
and
then
another
from
another
part
of
the
crowd
piercing
his
eardrums
and
still
more
screams
he
realized
what
was
happening
women
were
learning
that
their
men
had
not
come
back
scalps
and
screams
wolf
paw
gifts
to
the
british
band
white
bear
worked
his
way
past
women
calling
out
anxious
questions
he
suddenly
came
upon
his
mother
leading
a
wailing
pregnant
woman
out
of
the
crowd
she
heard
that
her
husband
was
killed
and
she
has
gone
into
labor
sun
woman
said
her
face
hollow
with
her
own
pain
white
bear
squeezed
her
arm
briefly
as
she
passed
him
when
he
got
close
to
wolf
paw
he
saw
a
bound
woman
body
draped
face
down
across
the
back
of
the
brave
gray
pony
she
wore
a
ragged
blue
dress
her
feet
were
bare
dirty
and
covered
with
scratches
she
did
not
stir
from
this
side
of
the
pony
white
bear
could
not
see
her
face
a
sickening
suspicion
gripped
him
and
he
hesitated
not
wanting
his
fear
confirmed
wolf
paw
frowning
down
at
him
angrily
was
still
wearing
his
yellow
and
red
war
paint
faded
by
the
ride
of
several
days
i
raided
the
town
where
you
lived
white
bear
i
took
forty
head
of
cattle
and
twenty
horses
from
your
pale
eyes
relatives
i
am
glad
to
hear
of
the
cattle
said
white
bear
our
people
are
starving
wanting
and
not
wanting
to
know
who
wolf
paw
captive
was
he
walked
around
the
brave
horse
for
a
better
look
at
the
bound
woman
we
killed
many
pale
eyes
wolf
paw
said
they
will
never
forget
wolf
paw
raid
tonight
we
will
have
a
scalp
dance
for
the
warriors
who
have
become
braves
white
bear
stopped
walking
people
he
knew
and
loved
on
both
sides
had
died
he
had
to
learn
which
ones
after
a
moment
he
collected
himself
and
will
you
dance
for
the
braves
and
warriors
you
did
not
bring
back
it
was
a
cruel
thing
to
say
but
wolf
paw
deserved
it
wolf
paw
did
not
answer
white
bear
had
to
fight
himself
to
keep
from
crying
aloud
in
anguish
he
no
longer
had
any
doubt
who
the
captive
woman
was
who
hung
head
down
over
the
spotted
pony
one
yellow
braid
was
still
tied
with
a
blue
bow
the
other
had
come
undone
and
loose
locks
of
blond
hair
hung
down
almost
brushing
the
ground
he
bent
to
see
nancy
unconscious
face
coming
up
beside
him
redbird
asked
quietly
do
you
know
this
woman
yes
he
said
it
all
came
back
to
him
last
summer
at
victoire
the
meetings
on
the
prairie
that
night
in
the
cornfield
beside
her
house
when
she
had
begged
him
to
know
her
had
he
missed
her
yes
he
had
to
admit
that
did
he
love
her
he
was
not
sure
but
happy
as
he
had
been
with
redbird
he
often
thought
of
nancy
and
wondered
if
she
still
longed
for
him
as
she
had
when
he
left
her
how
without
hurting
redbird
who
stood
next
to
him
watching
as
he
stared
down
at
nancy
could
he
explain
what
this
white
woman
meant
to
him
he
reached
out
to
untie
the
rope
looped
around
nancy
back
that
held
her
to
wolf
paw
horse
do
not
touch
her
wolf
paw
growled
she
is
for
me
and
only
for
me
no
white
bear
thought
he
could
not
let
nancy
be
kidnapped
and
raped
by
this
man
whatever
bloody
things
had
been
done
at
victor
this
he
must
prevent
he
readied
himself
to
fight
wolf
paw
if
he
had
to
and
how
would
he
explain
to
redbird
wolf
paw
slid
down
from
his
horse
and
untied
nancy
fresh
blood
was
soaking
through
the
cloth
around
his
shoulder
a
strip
of
blue
gingham
torn
from
nancy
dress
white
bear
now
saw
weak
from
his
wound
wolf
paw
could
not
lift
nancy
and
carry
her
regardless
of
wolf
paw
warning
white
bear
would
not
let
her
fall
he
took
her
from
wolf
paw
and
eased
her
to
the
ground
her
eyelids
were
fluttering
redbird
bending
awkwardly
with
her
swollen
belly
helped
him
their
eyes
met
and
she
looked
searchingly
into
his
a
woman
voice
cried
the
pale
eyes
squaw
is
for
you
wolf
paw
i
will
not
have
her
in
my
wickiup
running
deer
the
older
of
wolf
paw
two
wives
strode
up
to
wolf
paw
thrusting
her
face
into
his
behind
her
came
burning
pine
the
younger
wife
a
papoose
strapped
to
her
back
looking
equally
determined
my
wives
will
do
as
i
say
wolf
paw
grumbled
but
there
was
no
strength
in
his
voice
burning
pine
said
your
wives
and
children
are
hungry
we
are
eating
roots
and
bark
we
have
no
food
for
any
pale
eyes
for
now
black
hawk
band
was
hidden
away
on
an
island
of
dry
ground
in
the
heart
of
a
great
marsh
north
of
the
headwaters
of
the
rock
river
well
into
the
michigan
territory
but
there
was
scarcely
any
game
or
fish
here
and
they
could
not
stay
in
this
place
much
longer
wolf
paw
said
i
have
brought
cattle
then
the
people
will
eat
well
because
of
my
husband
running
deer
said
but
the
pale
eyes
woman
will
not
need
to
eat
running
deer
turned
to
the
crowd
many
women
lost
their
husbands
in
wolf
paw
raid
it
is
right
that
the
women
avenge
themselves
on
this
pale
eyes
white
bear
back
crawled
with
gooseflesh
running
deer
meant
for
the
women
of
the
band
to
torture
nancy
to
death
for
as
long
as
they
could
make
her
pain
last
it
would
take
their
minds
off
their
hunger
and
sickness
and
sorrow
and
their
own
fear
of
death
it
must
not
happen
but
how
could
he
prevent
it
feeling
like
a
drowning
man
being
swept
away
on
rapids
white
bear
watched
running
deer
and
burning
pine
lift
nancy
from
the
ground
and
carry
her
off
with
her
feet
dragging
wolf
paw
and
most
of
the
braves
who
had
returned
with
him
followed
wolf
paw
wives
pulled
nancy
through
the
band
collection
of
hastily
built
wickiups
and
they
brought
her
to
a
tall
elm
tree
growing
up
in
the
center
of
the
camp
the
tree
was
dying
its
bark
had
been
stripped
to
cover
a
wickiup
by
the
time
white
bear
caught
up
with
the
crowd
around
nancy
her
eyes
were
wide
open
but
unfocused
running
deer
pushed
her
against
the
trunk
of
the
elm
tree
and
drew
a
knife
with
swift
angry
slashes
wolf
senior
wife
stripped
away
nancy
dress
and
the
chemise
under
it
nancy
stood
naked
before
the
tribe
her
eyes
were
still
open
and
unseeing
she
made
no
attempt
to
cover
herself
she
did
not
seem
to
know
what
was
happening
to
her
white
bear
skin
crawled
with
shame
at
the
sight
of
her
degradation
women
laughed
her
skin
is
like
a
frog
belly
men
stared
greedily
running
deer
took
a
coil
of
rawhide
rope
and
lashed
nancy
to
the
tree
and
white
bear
felt
the
muscles
of
his
neck
and
shoulders
knotting
till
they
ached
he
could
scarcely
bear
to
look
at
nancy
who
hung
in
her
bonds
her
eyes
closed
again
he
did
not
care
if
they
killed
him
he
would
not
let
them
do
this
he
would
not
allow
it
to
go
on
a
moment
longer
he
put
his
hand
over
the
five
claw
scars
on
his
chest
and
spoke
to
his
spirit
self
bear
spirit
give
me
the
power
to
move
the
people
to
he
felt
strength
surge
into
his
chest
and
arms
and
raising
his
medicine
stick
he
strode
forward
when
he
was
only
a
foot
away
from
nancy
her
eyes
opened
suddenly
huge
and
turquoise
staring
into
his
auguste
her
voice
and
face
were
full
of
terror
it
came
to
him
with
a
shock
that
he
must
look
frightful
to
her
the
man
she
had
loved
was
transformed
into
a
vision
of
savagery
painted
face
a
mane
of
hair
silver
earrings
shell
necklace
his
scarred
chest
bare
holding
high
a
painted
stick
adorned
with
feathers
and
beads
and
what
would
she
make
of
his
right
ear
torn
in
two
by
eli
greenglove
rifle
ball
after
what
she
had
already
gone
through
the
sight
of
him
must
be
yet
another
impossible
shock
i
going
to
help
you
he
said
in
english
try
not
to
show
that
you
frightened
useless
advice
he
thought
still
it
would
be
better
for
them
both
if
the
people
respected
her
there
was
nothing
a
sauk
despised
more
than
a
show
of
fear
he
pointed
his
medicine
stick
at
running
deer
and
said
sternly
stand
aside
she
glowered
at
him
but
stepped
back
last
winter
wolf
paw
had
snatched
this
stick
from
his
hand
but
that
was
before
white
bear
had
nearly
been
killed
carrying
black
hawk
message
of
peace
to
the
pale
eyes
that
was
before
they
had
begun
to
see
for
themselves
that
white
bear
had
spoken
truly
when
he
warned
that
black
hawk
hope
of
a
great
alliance
to
defeat
the
long
knives
was
an
illusion
and
that
was
before
many
of
the
people
had
felt
his
healing
touch
he
knew
how
to
do
things
because
of
his
training
with
pale
eyes
doctors
that
owl
carver
and
sun
woman
did
not
now
white
bear
medicine
stick
had
much
more
power
than
a
few
moons
ago
even
at
this
moment
when
anxiety
for
nancy
gnawed
at
him
he
felt
pride
in
his
power
he
turned
to
face
the
crowd
standing
protectively
in
front
of
nancy
the
braves
and
warriors
stared
at
him
puzzled
and
angry
is
this
how
you
show
your
strength
and
courage
by
torturing
a
helpless
woman
he
demanded
wolf
paw
said
she
is
a
trophy
honorably
taken
in
battle
white
bear
pointed
to
running
deer
wolf
paw
meant
to
take
the
pale
eyes
woman
into
his
wickiup
for
his
pleasure
but
his
wife
will
not
let
him
so
he
pretends
that
it
is
his
pleasure
to
let
the
women
torture
her
feeling
stronger
than
ever
white
bear
watched
wolf
paw
face
darken
he
might
be
able
to
outfight
any
man
in
the
tribe
barehanded
or
with
weapons
but
not
with
words
this
moment
thought
white
bear
began
to
repay
wolf
paw
for
shaming
him
last
winter
before
the
council
he
will
have
to
let
me
tend
his
wound
that
too
will
repay
wolf
paw
stood
glowering
at
white
bear
his
eyes
glazing
his
breath
coming
in
gasps
he
must
be
on
the
verge
of
fainting
from
the
pain
white
bear
thought
i
captured
the
pale
eyes
woman
wolf
paw
said
i
give
her
to
the
tribe
are
we
fighting
the
pale
eyes
so
we
can
steal
their
women
white
bear
demanded
as
long
as
we
torture
and
kill
their
people
the
long
knives
will
think
of
us
as
wild
animals
that
must
be
destroyed
i
have
lived
among
the
pale
eyes
and
i
tell
you
that
we
must
show
them
that
we
are
worthy
of
their
respect
wolf
paw
grumbled
we
will
win
their
respect
by
killing
them
i
have
killed
many
at
victor
no
white
bear
thought
feeling
as
sick
as
wolf
paw
looked
hating
him
for
his
ignorance
he
addressed
the
whole
gathering
since
wolf
paw
has
given
this
woman
to
the
tribe
let
the
tribe
treat
her
honorably
white
bear
said
the
day
will
come
when
we
will
have
to
sit
down
with
the
long
knives
and
talk
not
if
we
win
cried
wolf
paw
win
white
bear
laughed
scornfully
does
wolf
paw
still
imagine
that
thousands
of
long
knives
are
going
to
surrender
to
our
few
hundred
sauk
and
fox
warriors
we
can
win
only
if
they
decide
to
stop
fighting
us
if
we
make
them
hate
us
they
will
never
stop
fighting
until
all
of
us
are
dead
is
probably
already
too
late
for
talking
with
the
long
knives
but
if
i
hold
out
the
hope
of
peace
it
may
save
nancy
he
let
his
gaze
travel
over
the
people
who
stood
in
a
ring
around
him
the
dark
eyes
looking
at
him
were
mostly
sullen
and
suspicious
because
their
shaman
was
telling
them
what
they
did
not
want
to
hear
no
one
seemed
ready
to
challenge
him
but
he
knew
that
if
three
or
four
braves
were
to
overpower
him
and
kill
nancy
the
crowd
would
let
it
happen
his
belly
muscles
knotted
with
tension
but
as
wolf
paw
had
said
they
needed
all
their
luck
and
it
would
be
best
not
to
tempt
the
wrath
of
the
spirits
by
defying
their
shaman
you
must
not
fail
he
gave
his
wife
a
look
of
appeal
before
he
spoke
further
behind
redbird
iron
knife
stood
like
a
great
oak
tree
at
least
there
was
no
threat
to
him
in
iron
knife
face
white
bear
took
a
deep
breath
and
his
heart
fluttered
his
life
and
nancy
depended
on
what
happened
next
i
take
the
pale
eyes
woman
under
my
protection
he
said
redbird
untie
her
redbird
hesitated
for
just
a
moment
her
eyes
wide
and
white
bear
held
his
breath
if
moved
by
jealousy
she
refused
to
obey
him
and
sided
with
running
deer
there
was
no
hope
for
nancy
at
that
thought
a
resolve
arose
in
him
dark
and
powerful
as
a
storm
on
the
great
river
and
he
filled
his
lungs
and
squared
his
shoulders
they
try
to
kill
her
they
will
have
to
kill
me
first
if
she
is
doomed
so
am
if
he
stood
by
and
let
the
people
torture
nancy
to
death
he
would
hate
himself
forever
redbird
lowered
her
eyes
and
began
to
undo
the
rope
around
nancy
iron
knife
helped
his
sister
relief
brightened
in
white
bear
like
sunlight
on
the
river
after
a
storm
relief
and
a
surge
of
love
for
his
wife
with
iron
knife
siding
with
him
and
wolf
paw
weakened
by
his
wound
no
brave
would
dare
to
challenge
him
eagle
feather
was
standing
in
front
of
the
crowd
and
white
bear
felt
proud
that
his
son
was
seeing
the
people
treat
him
with
respect
that
might
balance
out
the
memory
of
that
shameful
night
of
the
dress
eagle
feather
run
and
get
one
of
our
blankets
nancy
looked
at
white
bear
with
huge
frightened
eyes
saying
nothing
terror
must
have
struck
her
dumb
but
he
was
relieved
to
see
she
was
able
to
stand
on
her
own
redbird
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
to
steady
her
you
going
to
be
all
right
white
bear
said
in
english
we
will
take
you
to
my
wickiup
he
turned
to
wolf
paw
come
with
me
i
will
see
to
your
wound
wolf
paw
brown
skin
looked
clammy
and
bloodless
he
had
ridden
for
four
days
with
a
bullet
in
his
shoulder
it
must
come
out
at
once
or
it
would
kill
him
but
white
bear
took
pleasure
in
giving
orders
to
wolf
paw
eagle
feather
came
with
a
blanket
and
redbird
wrapped
it
around
nancy
most
of
the
people
scattered
many
to
mourn
their
dead
others
to
hear
the
stories
of
the
braves
and
warriors
who
had
come
back
with
the
war
party
still
others
to
see
the
horses
and
to
butcher
some
of
the
cattle
they
had
brought
back
a
small
crowd
followed
white
bear
the
prisoner
and
wolf
paw
as
redbird
and
iron
knife
helped
nancy
now
softly
sobbing
into
the
low
structure
of
branches
and
bark
owl
carver
came
up
to
white
bear
i
was
ready
to
terrify
the
people
if
they
turned
against
you
but
you
did
not
need
my
help
you
spoke
to
them
and
against
their
will
they
heeded
you
owl
carver
praise
delighted
white
bear
but
as
he
saw
once
again
how
the
old
shaman
had
declined
it
took
some
of
the
edge
from
his
pleasure
owl
carver
eyes
were
watery
and
his
cheeks
were
sunken
his
arms
and
legs
were
thin
as
spear
shafts
the
trek
up
the
rock
river
had
not
been
good
for
him
white
bear
and
sun
woman
had
taken
over
most
of
the
work
of
caring
for
the
wounded
and
sick
though
owl
carver
did
as
much
as
he
could
you
are
a
great
shaman
as
i
predicted
you
would
be
owl
carver
said
you
foretold
exactly
what
would
happen
if
black
hawk
led
the
british
band
across
the
great
river
but
i
am
sad
that
your
greatness
must
be
proved
by
the
suffering
of
our
people
white
bear
felt
his
chest
expand
and
a
warmth
spread
through
his
limbs
at
these
words
of
his
teacher
i
may
need
your
help
yet
he
said
the
people
do
not
like
me
protecting
this
pale
eyes
woman
owl
carver
nodded
but
they
respect
you
and
they
will
respect
you
more
when
you
show
them
you
have
magical
powers
i
have
no
magical
powers
you
do
it
was
not
i
who
put
the
mark
of
the
bear
on
your
chest
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
the
white
bear
is
your
spirit
self
and
he
can
act
in
this
world
the
mark
of
his
claws
is
the
mark
of
his
favor
as
white
bear
let
this
sink
in
wolf
paw
approached
with
a
stumbling
walk
running
deer
and
burning
pine
followed
him
out
of
their
wickiup
redbird
brought
a
blanket
white
bear
sauk
medicine
bag
and
his
black
bag
of
surgical
instruments
sit
in
the
wickiup
with
the
pale
eyes
woman
white
bear
told
redbird
she
is
very
frightened
i
am
frightened
too
said
redbird
as
she
left
him
white
bear
bit
his
lip
the
tone
of
her
voice
said
is
this
woman
as
white
bear
set
out
the
markers
for
the
seven
directions
positioning
four
stones
around
wolf
paw
he
said
this
will
hurt
very
much
and
wolf
paw
must
not
move
keeping
in
place
the
two
stones
and
the
bear
claw
white
bear
laid
on
wolf
paw
chest
would
force
the
brave
to
lie
still
you
can
not
hurt
me
said
wolf
paw
just
as
if
he
were
a
captive
and
white
bear
was
about
to
torture
him
white
bear
turned
to
the
people
standing
around
them
all
of
you
join
hands
and
ask
earthmaker
to
heal
wolf
paw
wound
running
deer
face
which
had
been
hard
with
anger
now
melted
into
tears
burning
pine
looked
hopefully
at
white
bear
white
bear
gestured
to
iron
knife
to
lift
wolf
paw
shoulder
slightly
carefully
gently
he
untied
and
unwrapped
the
blue
rag
torn
from
nancy
dress
recent
bleeding
had
softened
the
scab
so
that
the
cloth
came
away
easily
from
the
wound
which
was
between
wolf
left
armpit
and
his
collarbone
its
shape
surprised
white
bear
not
a
round
bullet
hole
but
a
long
narrow
gash
surrounded
by
bruised
and
swollen
flesh
how
did
this
happen
to
you
he
asked
he
was
going
to
have
to
hurt
wolf
paw
all
the
more
because
the
wound
had
gone
untreated
for
four
days
when
the
braves
attacked
the
blockhouse
all
together
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
pale
eyes
opened
the
door
and
fired
a
big
gun
white
bear
desperately
wanted
to
make
wolf
paw
tell
him
everything
that
had
happened
but
there
was
no
time
for
that
now
and
after
he
heard
wolf
paw
tale
he
might
want
to
hurt
him
even
more
than
he
had
to
raoul
kept
a
naval
at
the
trading
post
white
bear
had
heard
about
it
probably
this
was
a
piece
of
what
the
long
knives
called
canister
shot
or
grapeshot
in
wolf
paw
shoulder
but
then
why
not
a
round
hole
white
bear
slid
the
steel
rod
he
would
use
to
explore
wolf
paw
wound
through
a
loop
in
the
end
of
the
tongs
to
see
how
the
brave
was
taking
it
he
looked
up
at
his
face
wolf
paw
stared
back
at
him
with
hard
black
eyes
as
he
pushed
the
probe
into
the
wound
with
one
hand
the
other
holding
the
handles
of
the
tongs
when
the
rounded
tip
of
the
probe
had
gone
in
about
half
a
finger
length
it
touched
something
hard
not
a
bone
white
bear
was
sure
he
moved
the
probe
up
and
down
and
from
side
to
side
the
only
sign
of
pain
wolf
paw
gave
was
deeper
heavier
breathing
how
odd
the
object
was
definitely
flat
and
must
have
hit
wolf
paw
edge
on
it
lay
buried
in
a
muscle
an
inch
higher
and
whatever
it
was
would
have
broken
wolf
paw
shoulder
white
bear
moved
the
tongs
into
position
within
the
torn
flesh
one
end
on
each
side
of
the
flat
object
his
hand
ached
as
he
tightened
his
grip
on
the
tongs
he
had
learned
how
to
get
a
good
grip
on
bullets
but
the
blood
would
make
this
flat
missile
slippery
wolf
paw
was
not
breathing
now
white
bear
did
not
dare
to
look
into
his
face
for
both
of
them
white
bear
understood
this
was
a
moment
of
testing
holding
his
own
breath
praying
to
earthmaker
to
strengthen
his
grip
on
the
tongs
white
bear
began
to
pull
wolf
paw
gave
the
faintest
groan
another
man
would
probably
be
screaming
the
flat
piece
of
metal
came
almost
to
the
surface
of
wolf
blackened
flesh
but
slid
out
of
the
tongs
grip
just
as
white
bear
was
about
to
draw
it
out
he
gritted
his
teeth
in
anger
wolf
paw
sighed
white
bear
looked
at
his
face
and
saw
that
only
the
whites
of
his
eyes
were
showing
under
the
lids
mercifully
for
both
of
them
he
had
fainted
white
bear
looked
again
at
the
object
he
was
trying
to
pull
out
of
wolf
paw
shoulder
he
could
just
see
a
corrugated
edge
covered
with
blood
with
a
bit
of
cloth
he
wiped
the
blood
away
and
saw
a
bright
silver
gleam
he
gave
a
little
gasp
of
amazement
silver
coin
the
last
thing
anyone
would
expect
to
find
loaded
into
a
cannon
or
embedded
in
a
man
body
those
people
at
victor
must
have
been
that
gave
white
bear
an
inspiration
no
one
else
was
close
enough
to
see
what
he
had
seen
in
the
wound
he
remembered
what
owl
carver
had
said
about
showing
the
people
magical
powers
he
waited
until
he
saw
wolf
paw
eyelids
flutter
and
then
said
wolf
paw
because
you
have
allowed
the
pale
eyes
woman
to
live
the
spirits
will
reward
you
wolf
paw
his
lips
compressed
frowned
at
him
the
spirits
will
allow
me
to
change
the
lead
ball
the
pale
eyes
shot
into
you
to
one
of
their
silver
coins
he
spoke
loudly
so
that
the
people
watching
could
all
hear
him
wolf
paw
stared
as
white
bear
passed
his
medicine
stick
three
times
in
a
sunwise
circle
over
the
bleeding
shoulder
once
again
white
bear
pushed
the
tongs
into
the
wound
he
pushed
the
ends
in
past
the
coin
to
get
a
good
purchase
on
it
wolf
paw
groaned
white
bear
pulled
joy
sprang
up
in
him
as
he
felt
the
silver
coin
coming
free
he
had
it
this
time
the
spirits
might
not
have
changed
lead
to
silver
but
they
had
made
him
skillful
the
tongs
came
out
holding
an
silver
piece
dripping
with
blood
white
bear
held
it
up
for
all
to
see
wolf
paw
eyes
grew
round
the
people
cried
out
in
amazement
even
owl
carver
looked
astonished
delighted
with
the
effect
white
bear
wiped
the
blood
from
the
spanish
dollar
carefully
with
the
rag
from
nancy
dress
it
shone
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
the
head
of
the
king
of
spain
on
one
side
along
with
a
latin
inscription
and
the
date
on
the
other
side
a
coat
of
arms
perfect
now
he
thought
with
pleasure
the
braves
and
warriors
and
their
wives
would
be
more
reluctant
than
ever
to
challenge
him
and
that
meant
nancy
would
be
safer
he
held
the
coin
before
wolf
paw
face
the
form
is
the
form
of
a
pale
eyes
coin
but
this
is
a
gift
from
the
spirits
wolf
paw
slowly
sitting
up
took
the
coin
and
said
i
will
wear
it
around
my
neck
maybe
it
will
be
a
charm
against
more
wounds
let
it
remind
you
that
it
is
honorable
to
treat
prisoners
kindly
said
white
bear
he
kept
his
face
grave
but
within
he
was
bubbling
over
with
triumph
after
stuffing
the
wound
with
buzzard
down
and
giving
wolf
paw
herb
tea
to
drink
white
bear
sent
him
on
his
way
the
brave
stumbled
off
leaning
on
running
deer
white
bear
stood
up
stretched
his
tired
arms
and
legs
and
turned
to
the
doorway
of
his
wickiup
a
painful
moment
of
doubt
assailed
him
was
this
what
the
way
of
the
shaman
came
to
then
trickery
perhaps
his
visions
too
were
only
dreams
no
the
white
bear
spirit
was
real
he
had
seen
the
paw
print
beside
his
father
body
he
bore
the
claw
marks
on
his
chest
he
had
to
force
himself
to
stoop
down
to
step
through
the
low
doorway
and
face
nancy
he
felt
tremulous
within
whatever
horrors
nancy
had
seen
and
endured
she
would
surely
blame
them
on
him
in
all
his
paint
and
ornaments
he
was
too
obviously
a
sauk
and
how
would
his
efforts
to
protect
nancy
and
win
her
trust
make
redbird
feel
how
could
he
make
her
truly
understand
what
was
between
him
and
nancy
and
what
was
not
he
was
not
sure
that
he
himself
understood
it
in
the
light
from
the
open
doorway
he
saw
nancy
crouched
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
round
hut
trembling
still
wrapped
in
the
blanket
redbird
had
put
on
her
redbird
and
eagle
feather
were
sitting
silently
against
the
curving
wall
he
sat
down
facing
nancy
and
she
drew
away
shuddering
he
said
do
be
afraid
of
me
nancy
i
know
i
look
strange
to
you
i
the
shaman
the
medicine
man
for
my
people
your
people
she
burst
out
your
people
murdered
my
father
he
had
been
afraid
of
that
he
bowed
his
head
and
closed
his
eyes
oh
nancy
i
sorry
a
ridiculous
futile
thing
to
must
know
what
happened
at
victor
nancy
father
was
killed
who
else
white
bear
said
nancy
i
do
ask
you
to
forgive
me
for
what
my
people
did
to
you
but
i
did
try
to
stop
all
this
from
happening
i
pray
you
let
me
tell
you
how
i
tried
to
make
peace
and
you
are
safe
now
as
long
as
you
stay
with
me
safe
with
you
here
she
shuddered
if
i
mean
anything
at
all
to
you
you
got
to
help
me
to
get
away
his
heart
sank
the
one
thing
he
was
sure
he
could
not
do
was
have
her
set
free
that
will
be
hard
i
heard
you
talking
to
them
you
were
ordering
them
to
leave
me
alone
and
they
did
tell
them
to
let
me
go
auguste
i
go
mad
i
so
frightened
she
clutched
at
his
arm
he
could
feel
her
fear
pouring
into
his
arm
up
to
his
heart
he
put
his
hand
on
top
of
hers
and
held
it
firmly
he
wanted
to
take
her
in
his
arms
to
comfort
her
but
redbird
eyes
were
on
him
and
she
would
not
understand
so
he
just
patted
nancy
hand
and
released
it
he
told
redbird
what
he
had
been
saying
to
nancy
does
she
not
see
that
the
braves
would
kill
you
if
you
tried
to
set
her
free
redbird
asked
she
is
too
frightened
to
see
anything
he
said
and
turned
back
to
nancy
the
only
man
who
can
free
you
is
black
hawk
i
try
to
convince
him
that
he
should
but
he
is
away
with
a
war
party
now
killing
more
innocent
men
and
women
and
children
her
teeth
and
eyes
gleamed
in
the
faint
light
within
the
wickiup
her
words
left
a
hollow
ache
in
his
chest
but
he
went
on
speaking
doggedly
when
he
comes
back
i
go
to
him
meanwhile
ask
your
god
to
help
you
be
brave
she
let
go
of
his
arm
abruptly
what
do
you
know
about
my
god
with
your
paint
and
your
feathers
and
your
magic
wand
her
words
hurt
and
he
was
about
to
answer
angrily
but
he
told
himself
she
was
half
mad
with
terror
and
grief
because
i
have
these
things
i
can
help
you
he
said
gently
but
i
want
so
much
to
know
what
happened
at
victor
can
you
bear
to
tell
me
she
took
his
arm
again
i
just
gotten
dressed
to
go
out
and
feed
the
animals
when
i
saw
the
indians
riding
toward
our
house
so
many
of
them
i
knew
right
away
i
ran
into
the
house
and
woke
father
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
house
he
was
standing
in
the
doorway
he
never
even
got
his
rifle
loaded
auguste
before
he
could
move
there
was
an
arrow
in
his
chest
white
bear
knew
that
reverend
hale
had
never
liked
him
but
he
was
nancy
father
and
to
see
her
father
killed
how
that
must
hurt
her
he
was
a
good
man
he
said
he
never
did
harm
to
our
people
it
is
wrong
that
he
died
nancy
went
on
sobbing
softly
i
must
have
fainted
i
remember
a
ride
i
was
thrown
over
the
back
of
a
horse
then
we
were
at
victoire
auguste
they
they
just
overran
victoire
did
anyone
get
away
i
think
the
people
at
victoire
must
have
seen
our
church
and
the
farms
burning
so
they
had
some
warning
i
could
see
much
i
was
left
tied
on
the
horse
while
they
attacked
i
did
see
them
chase
one
woman
and
run
a
spear
through
her
it
was
over
very
quickly
they
set
fire
to
victoire
white
bear
swallowed
hard
he
saw
the
château
with
its
magnificent
hall
and
its
great
sweeping
roof
there
he
had
lived
and
learned
so
much
from
grandpapa
and
father
their
hopes
their
lives
had
gone
into
that
great
house
and
the
men
and
women
of
victoire
kindly
cheerful
people
marchette
perrault
registre
and
bernadette
bosquet
they
may
not
have
tried
to
stop
raoul
from
seizing
the
estate
but
they
had
most
of
them
loved
elysée
and
pierre
and
auguste
de
marion
the
pain
in
his
chest
spread
till
it
seemed
to
fill
his
whole
world
hammering
at
him
inside
and
out
nancy
said
then
they
rode
on
to
victor
taking
me
with
them
he
choked
as
he
asked
did
they
burn
victor
down
too
yes
as
they
left
a
voice
seemed
to
echo
inside
him
like
a
scream
in
a
huge
empty
hall
frank
grandpapa
can
you
tell
me
my
family
were
any
of
them
hurt
nancy
said
i
think
the
people
at
victor
got
into
the
trading
post
before
the
indians
got
there
there
were
men
on
the
palisade
shooting
at
the
indians
the
leader
the
one
with
the
red
crest
on
his
head
tied
me
to
a
tree
i
had
to
watch
it
all
he
is
called
wolf
paw
he
is
black
hawk
son
i
hope
the
army
gets
him
and
hangs
him
from
the
highest
gallows
in
illinois
he
left
me
tied
to
that
tree
all
day
while
they
tried
to
take
the
trading
post
the
words
tumbled
out
faster
and
faster
when
she
had
first
regained
consciousness
she
could
hardly
speak
at
all
now
her
eyes
glittered
and
she
moved
her
hands
violently
hysteria
had
broken
through
her
former
numbness
i
could
see
them
using
ropes
to
climb
the
palisade
and
charging
in
through
the
front
gate
every
so
often
they
would
pull
out
some
dead
or
wounded
just
before
sunset
the
one
you
call
wolf
paw
made
a
speech
to
them
then
they
set
fire
to
arrows
and
shot
them
at
the
blockhouse
and
they
all
rushed
in
through
the
front
gate
i
thought
that
would
be
the
end
but
then
i
heard
a
tremendous
explosion
i
thought
maybe
somebody
blew
up
the
blockhouse
a
big
puff
of
smoke
rose
up
over
the
palisade
wolf
paw
came
out
wounded
that
very
big
man
helped
him
put
me
on
his
horse
and
tie
me
there
and
then
we
rode
for
four
days
till
we
got
here
auguste
began
to
breathe
easier
he
felt
some
relief
some
hope
despite
his
pain
for
the
loss
of
victoire
and
for
the
people
who
had
died
there
it
sounded
as
if
many
of
the
people
of
victor
perhaps
nicole
and
her
family
perhaps
grandpapa
might
have
come
through
unharmed
but
another
fear
took
a
grip
on
him
on
the
way
here
did
wolf
paw
hurt
you
nancy
no
i
think
he
was
too
tired
and
too
badly
hurt
to
want
to
do
anything
like
that
we
rode
hard
and
he
kept
me
tied
on
his
horse
all
the
time
we
stopped
to
sleep
long
after
dark
and
started
riding
again
before
sunup
there
was
always
at
least
one
man
awake
to
guard
me
all
the
while
she
had
been
talking
nancy
had
kept
a
tight
grasp
on
his
arm
now
he
gently
pulled
away
from
her
and
stood
up
nancy
i
must
leave
you
for
a
while
no
her
voice
was
shrill
with
fear
i
must
there
are
many
wounded
who
need
me
fearful
of
how
she
would
react
to
what
he
was
going
to
say
next
he
hesitated
then
he
spoke
quickly
to
get
it
over
with
as
he
did
when
he
had
to
hurt
a
patient
this
is
my
wife
redbird
she
will
care
for
you
your
wife
even
in
the
semidarkness
of
the
wickiup
white
bear
could
see
pain
in
her
eyes
yes
he
had
no
time
now
to
ease
her
suffering
on
that
score
he
turned
to
redbird
and
said
in
sauk
do
what
you
can
for
her
she
saw
her
father
and
many
others
of
her
people
killed
i
must
know
who
she
is
said
redbird
fixing
him
with
her
slanting
eyes
he
laid
a
reassuring
hand
on
her
shoulder
have
no
fear
i
will
tell
you
everything
tonight
see
that
she
eats
give
her
maple
sugar
help
her
to
rest
white
bear
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
moving
through
the
wickiups
under
the
trees
with
his
sauk
medicine
bag
and
his
bag
of
pale
eyes
surgical
instruments
wolf
paw
had
brought
back
many
wounded
braves
together
with
sun
woman
and
owl
carver
white
bear
treated
those
he
could
and
made
the
dying
more
comfortable
he
went
to
the
families
of
the
braves
and
warriors
who
had
been
killed
and
tried
to
comfort
them
performing
rituals
that
helped
them
let
their
loved
ones
go
to
walk
west
on
the
trail
of
souls
by
late
afternoon
white
bear
was
sick
with
disgust
at
the
suffering
and
death
this
war
had
brought
and
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
go
off
by
himself
and
weep
for
his
people
wolf
paw
raid
had
brought
back
cattle
and
horses
but
nearly
two
dozen
men
had
died
and
an
equal
number
were
badly
hurt
all
for
what
to
make
the
long
knives
hate
us
at
sunset
another
war
party
thundered
in
this
one
led
by
black
hawk
himself
with
the
winnebago
prophet
riding
beside
him
and
more
wounded
men
to
treat
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
a
delicious
scent
crept
into
white
nostrils
one
that
neither
he
nor
any
of
the
british
band
had
smelled
for
far
too
long
roasting
beef
now
that
it
was
dark
and
smoke
from
fires
could
no
longer
be
seen
people
were
roasting
the
cattle
wolf
paw
had
brought
from
victoire
there
were
so
many
empty
bellies
to
feed
they
had
probably
butchered
all
the
steers
rights
those
are
my
white
bear
thought
wryly
stole
them
from
me
and
wolf
paw
stole
them
from
white
bear
saw
many
small
fires
throughout
the
camp
in
time
of
peace
a
feast
like
this
would
call
for
one
big
fire
but
that
would
send
up
a
glow
that
could
be
seen
from
a
distance
he
felt
a
surge
of
resentment
when
he
saw
how
calm
and
contented
black
hawk
looked
sitting
at
a
fire
before
his
wickiup
chewing
on
strips
of
beef
his
wife
had
laid
before
him
on
a
mat
until
today
the
people
had
been
on
the
verge
of
starvation
and
scouts
had
reported
that
an
army
of
over
two
thousand
long
knives
was
working
its
way
up
the
rock
river
toward
them
how
could
black
hawk
bear
the
responsibility
for
bringing
so
much
anguish
down
on
his
people
to
white
bear
disappointment
the
winnebago
prophet
sat
next
to
black
hawk
at
the
sight
of
flying
cloud
with
his
long
greasy
hair
and
the
mustache
that
looked
something
like
raoul
white
bear
shoulders
slumped
he
felt
an
impulse
to
turn
away
and
seek
black
hawk
out
another
time
the
prophet
winnebago
followers
were
long
since
gone
but
the
prophet
himself
was
still
predicting
mighty
victories
over
the
long
knives
white
bear
remembered
a
scripture
reading
he
heard
at
george
that
false
prophets
would
arise
at
the
end
of
the
world
this
might
well
be
the
end
of
the
world
for
the
sauk
they
certainly
had
their
false
prophet
but
a
talk
with
black
hawk
about
nancy
was
too
important
to
put
off
white
bear
sat
down
silently
facing
black
hawk
he
waited
for
the
war
leader
to
speak
to
him
he
felt
ravenously
hungry
watching
the
two
men
chew
their
beef
he
himself
had
not
had
time
to
eat
black
hawk
strong
hand
stroked
the
leather
cover
of
one
of
the
law
books
he
had
captured
at
old
man
creek
you
healed
my
son
and
drew
spirit
silver
from
his
body
black
hawk
said
accept
my
thanks
i
am
happy
to
have
made
black
hawk
happy
black
hawk
gestured
toward
the
beef
share
my
food
white
bear
picked
up
a
strip
of
meat
still
hot
saliva
seemed
to
flood
his
mouth
he
chewed
ferociously
closing
his
eyes
for
an
instant
in
pleasure
black
hawk
smiled
slightly
while
flying
cloud
paying
no
attention
to
white
bear
gnawed
on
a
rib
after
a
time
during
which
white
bear
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
hot
juicy
meat
black
hawk
called
him
back
to
his
reason
for
coming
here
i
am
told
you
have
a
pale
eyes
woman
prisoner
i
came
to
speak
to
you
about
her
white
bear
said
and
silently
asked
his
spirit
self
to
help
him
persuade
black
hawk
to
let
her
go
he
told
black
hawk
how
he
had
convinced
the
people
not
to
kill
her
you
did
well
said
black
hawk
we
must
make
the
long
knives
respect
us
not
just
fear
us
warriors
should
not
torture
and
kill
prisoners
the
great
shooting
star
would
never
let
his
men
torture
prisoners
white
bear
felt
a
glow
of
pleasure
at
black
hawk
approval
he
felt
more
hopeful
that
black
hawk
might
listen
to
him
he
decided
to
plunge
ahead
with
his
request
if
we
give
this
woman
back
to
the
pale
eyes
maybe
they
will
talk
peace
with
us
the
winnebago
prophet
stopped
eating
long
enough
to
say
better
to
keep
her
if
the
long
knives
attack
us
we
can
threaten
to
kill
her
aware
that
flying
cloud
argument
made
a
kind
of
brutal
sense
white
bear
felt
a
sinking
in
his
chest
black
hawk
pursed
his
wide
mouth
thoughtfully
the
prophet
speaks
wisely
it
is
foolish
to
give
the
woman
to
the
long
knives
as
a
gift
we
should
hold
her
until
we
are
ready
to
trade
her
for
something
he
turned
his
sombre
gaze
on
white
bear
you
must
keep
her
you
must
not
let
her
escape
white
bear
now
had
to
go
back
to
tell
nancy
that
the
sauk
would
not
let
her
go
the
thought
of
her
terror
and
misery
made
him
sick
with
sorrow
for
her
and
afraid
for
her
too
every
day
that
the
sauk
suffered
hunger
and
illness
every
time
more
men
were
killed
the
women
would
want
all
the
more
to
hurt
the
one
pale
eyes
who
was
in
their
power
and
the
men
would
hunger
to
take
pleasure
with
her
beauty
he
could
not
guard
her
at
every
moment
how
then
could
he
keep
her
safe
they
sat
in
silence
again
the
winnebago
prophet
looked
pleased
with
himself
black
hawk
was
grim
probably
brooding
over
how
badly
the
war
was
progressing
desperate
to
protect
nancy
white
bear
could
think
of
only
one
way
he
said
i
want
to
make
the
pale
eyes
woman
my
wife
black
hawk
eyebrows
rose
why
should
white
bear
do
that
the
people
will
not
kill
the
wife
of
a
shaman
the
winnebago
prophet
burst
out
this
is
wrong
the
spirits
have
told
me
that
our
people
must
not
mate
with
the
pale
eyes
black
hawk
said
white
bear
father
was
a
pale
eyes
the
offspring
of
an
impure
mating
should
not
be
a
shaman
flying
cloud
grumbled
white
bear
felt
his
cheeks
burn
the
winnebago
prophet
might
as
well
have
slapped
him
he
remembered
so
long
ago
it
now
seemed
though
it
was
really
only
nine
months
when
père
isaac
speaking
at
pierre
funeral
had
called
white
bear
the
fruit
of
sin
he
had
thought
then
that
no
red
man
would
speak
so
demeaningly
of
his
parentage
and
here
now
was
a
shaman
of
the
red
men
who
did
black
hawk
said
white
bear
has
always
been
one
of
us
he
has
seen
visions
he
has
saved
many
lives
the
mark
of
the
bear
one
of
the
most
powerful
spirits
is
on
him
let
him
do
as
he
thinks
best
the
prophet
said
the
spirits
have
told
me
a
man
should
not
have
more
than
one
wife
black
hawk
glared
at
him
that
is
foolish
talk
i
have
been
content
to
have
one
wife
singing
bird
but
my
son
wolf
paw
has
two
wives
and
many
of
our
chiefs
and
braves
have
two
or
three
wives
and
when
many
men
die
in
battle
many
women
need
to
be
cared
for
flying
cloud
grunted
and
fell
silent
white
bear
took
his
leave
of
black
hawk
and
threaded
his
way
among
the
shelters
and
past
the
small
campfires
where
beef
was
still
roasting
on
spits
redbird
must
agree
to
his
plan
before
he
could
tell
it
to
nancy
he
was
afraid
afraid
that
she
would
say
no
and
afraid
that
his
request
would
hurt
her
when
he
reached
his
wickiup
he
called
redbird
out
and
they
walked
through
the
camp
together
sun
woman
is
with
the
woman
in
the
wickiup
redbird
said
sun
woman
speaks
to
her
in
the
pale
eyes
language
that
she
learned
from
your
father
i
think
the
is
not
so
frightened
anymore
that
is
good
said
white
bear
gloomily
because
black
hawk
says
she
must
remain
a
prisoner
redbird
sighed
i
feared
he
would
say
that
they
climbed
a
low
hill
north
of
the
camp
and
sat
on
a
huge
boulder
overlooking
a
small
lake
a
newly
risen
crescent
moon
was
reflected
in
the
still
black
water
white
bear
put
his
hand
on
redbird
belly
and
felt
the
movement
of
the
child
within
her
redbird
said
what
is
this
woman
to
you
white
bear
stiffened
would
she
understand
would
she
believe
him
white
bear
searched
his
mind
for
a
way
to
explain
she
was
a
friend
to
me
when
i
lived
at
victor
was
she
your
woman
redbird
asked
no
she
wanted
to
be
but
i
would
not
let
it
happen
because
i
knew
that
one
day
i
must
leave
her
i
feared
that
if
i
let
myself
love
nancy
i
would
never
return
to
my
people
and
to
you
did
not
even
lie
with
her
no
i
would
be
foolish
to
believe
that
i
would
tell
you
if
i
had
done
that
i
did
want
to
and
she
wanted
to
but
i
would
not
does
it
make
you
hate
her
to
know
she
wanted
that
of
me
redbird
head
was
bowed
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
you
are
a
man
many
women
would
want
i
can
not
hate
them
all
when
i
asked
you
to
untie
nancy
today
and
take
her
to
our
wickiup
you
could
have
refused
me
as
running
deer
did
to
wolf
paw
then
the
women
would
have
cut
her
to
pieces
i
could
not
have
stopped
them
i
thank
you
for
honoring
my
wishes
redbird
said
you
would
have
tried
to
stop
them
and
you
would
have
been
hurt
i
did
not
want
that
to
happen
she
looked
up
at
him
suddenly
smiling
and
i
knew
that
people
would
say
white
wife
does
as
he
asks
but
wolf
paw
wife
makes
him
look
foolish
it
felt
good
to
make
wolf
paw
look
foolish
after
what
he
did
to
us
it
warmed
him
to
hear
her
say
us
now
i
want
to
do
something
more
for
her
he
said
but
i
can
only
do
it
if
you
will
say
yes
to
it
he
held
his
breath
redbird
said
if
you
made
her
your
wife
then
no
one
in
the
band
would
dare
to
hurt
her
white
bear
let
out
a
deep
sigh
he
should
have
known
her
thoughts
would
move
as
swiftly
as
his
own
he
had
wondered
how
to
say
it
to
her
and
she
had
said
it
for
him
only
to
protect
her
not
to
be
truly
my
wife
will
you
consent
she
stroked
the
back
of
his
hand
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
we
keep
her
safe
you
and
i
did
not
want
our
people
to
fight
and
kill
the
pale
eyes
she
pressed
her
warm
hand
against
his
at
least
we
can
keep
them
from
killing
this
one
the
ripples
on
the
lake
reflected
fragments
of
moonlight
white
bear
felt
he
could
see
his
love
for
redbird
and
it
looked
like
what
lay
before
him
a
lake
of
silver
he
leaned
against
her
and
her
back
rested
against
his
arm
i
promise
you
i
will
not
bed
with
her
she
smiled
at
him
again
why
promise
that
the
question
surprised
him
you
are
my
true
wife
and
the
only
wife
i
want
he
recalled
black
hawk
loyalty
to
singing
bird
that
was
the
right
way
to
live
redbird
said
if
you
do
go
to
her
in
the
night
i
will
understand
especially
now
when
i
am
so
big
and
we
can
not
get
together
easily
i
believe
you
when
you
say
you
love
me
more
than
her
but
she
is
tall
and
has
hair
like
gold
and
very
white
skin
and
i
am
small
and
have
brown
skin
perhaps
the
pale
eyes
in
you
would
prefer
her
i
think
the
pale
eyes
in
me
and
the
sauk
in
me
are
one
and
that
one
prefers
you
she
took
his
hand
and
moved
it
down
her
body
till
he
felt
the
warm
soft
place
whence
in
little
more
than
a
moon
their
baby
would
emerge
i
want
to
do
this
with
you
now
she
whispered
i
think
we
can
if
you
go
into
me
only
a
little
way
when
redbird
and
white
bear
returned
to
their
wickiup
the
crescent
moon
had
reached
the
high
point
of
its
trail
across
the
sky
within
the
simple
shelter
he
and
redbird
had
built
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anyone
his
mother
voice
whispered
eagle
feather
and
yellow
hair
are
sleeping
she
is
terribly
frightened
but
she
has
been
through
so
much
she
is
exhausted
i
thank
you
for
helping
her
white
bear
whispered
in
the
morning
i
must
tell
her
that
black
hawk
will
not
let
her
go
that
makes
me
sad
for
her
said
sun
woman
she
is
in
such
misery
i
sense
a
strength
in
her
but
this
is
a
very
bad
time
for
her
you
must
not
stop
being
kind
to
her
not
even
for
a
moment
sun
woman
ducked
out
through
the
doorway
of
the
wickiup
nancy
was
sleeping
in
redbird
bed
redbird
and
white
bear
lay
down
together
on
his
pallet
of
reeds
and
blankets
her
back
against
his
chest
and
slept
when
white
bear
eyes
opened
the
faint
light
filtering
through
the
layer
of
bark
overhead
let
him
see
a
figure
sitting
up
across
from
him
outside
he
heard
the
sounds
of
the
camp
stirring
men
and
women
calling
to
one
another
horses
stamping
he
felt
a
rush
of
pity
as
he
recognized
nancy
what
she
must
be
feeling
at
this
moment
oh
my
god
he
heard
her
say
lord
jesus
help
me
it
must
have
taken
her
a
moment
to
realize
where
she
was
nancy
he
said
trying
to
keep
his
voice
calm
and
pleasant
come
with
me
and
let
us
talk
they
left
the
wickiup
and
she
walked
through
the
camp
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
too
frightened
he
supposed
to
look
about
her
people
stared
but
white
bear
wore
a
forbidding
look
and
they
kept
their
distance
she
had
on
a
doeskin
dress
that
sun
woman
had
given
her
and
she
had
done
up
her
two
blond
braids
the
way
she
always
had
he
felt
a
little
catch
in
his
throat
as
he
looked
at
her
and
remembered
those
meetings
on
the
prairie
near
victoire
every
so
often
as
they
walked
along
she
twisted
her
shoulders
inside
the
soft
leather
and
rubbed
her
arms
uncomfortably
they
passed
a
group
of
warriors
who
had
felled
a
big
oak
tree
and
were
burning
and
scraping
its
inside
to
make
a
dugout
the
men
stopped
work
to
watch
her
go
by
seeing
the
way
they
looked
at
her
white
bear
thought
she
must
marry
he
hoped
he
could
persuade
her
that
it
would
be
the
only
way
for
her
to
be
safe
he
led
her
to
the
western
edge
of
the
high
ground
on
which
the
band
had
made
their
camp
they
stopped
when
the
earth
underfoot
turned
soft
and
wet
before
them
lay
an
expanse
of
reeds
that
vanished
into
morning
mist
did
you
talk
to
black
hawk
she
asked
her
voice
trembling
can
i
get
away
from
here
white
bear
remembered
sun
woman
admonition
to
be
kind
to
nancy
at
every
moment
he
tried
to
think
how
best
to
tell
her
the
bad
news
how
to
add
only
the
smallest
possible
amount
of
fear
to
her
burden
black
hawk
is
pleased
that
i
stopped
the
people
from
hurting
you
yesterday
he
began
tentatively
he
said
the
white
men
despise
indians
when
they
kill
their
prisoners
her
lips
trembled
he
not
going
to
let
me
go
is
he
she
said
and
sobs
began
to
shake
her
body
when
she
was
able
she
turned
pleadingly
toward
him
could
you
do
anything
for
me
white
bear
spread
his
hands
helplessly
i
talked
to
him
as
best
i
could
he
tried
to
tell
her
something
encouraging
he
just
wants
to
keep
you
until
he
can
talk
to
the
soldiers
and
make
some
kind
of
a
truce
she
drew
away
from
him
her
eyes
wide
a
truce
does
black
hawk
really
think
he
can
make
a
truce
do
you
realize
what
your
brave
indians
have
been
doing
all
over
the
frontier
burnings
and
massacres
everywhere
i
told
you
what
they
did
at
victor
do
you
think
the
soldiers
would
ever
be
willing
to
talk
peace
with
black
hawk
now
white
bear
had
listened
to
the
returning
warriors
tales
of
victories
over
the
long
knives
at
kellogg
grove
at
indian
creek
along
the
road
in
despair
he
had
realized
that
what
the
sauk
saw
as
battles
in
a
war
to
defend
their
homeland
were
to
the
white
people
of
illinois
bloody
and
abominable
crimes
who
after
all
had
black
hawk
war
parties
been
killing
some
soldiers
but
mostly
farmers
and
their
wives
and
children
it
tormented
him
now
as
it
did
day
and
night
that
no
one
could
see
the
bloodshed
as
he
did
with
the
eyes
of
both
a
white
man
and
a
sauk
to
him
what
the
sauk
were
doing
was
horrible
but
it
was
done
out
of
a
desperate
need
to
cling
to
the
land
that
meant
life
to
them
and
nancy
capture
showed
him
how
much
his
years
among
the
pale
eyes
had
changed
him
even
if
wolf
paw
had
brought
back
a
captive
woman
who
was
a
stranger
to
him
he
would
have
tried
to
save
her
nor
could
he
feel
that
a
people
willing
to
torture
any
woman
to
death
were
fully
people
nancy
shook
her
head
there
will
be
no
truce
auguste
they
coming
to
destroy
you
we
asked
for
peace
he
began
before
all
this
killing
started
i
went
with
a
white
flag
myself
her
chest
heaved
and
her
face
was
a
mottled
red
and
white
they
do
peace
with
you
your
braves
will
kill
me
when
they
realize
that
or
the
soldiers
will
kill
me
when
they
kill
all
of
your
people
no
he
cried
knowing
the
truth
in
her
words
and
fighting
the
agony
within
let
me
go
she
screamed
she
suddenly
whirled
away
from
him
and
threw
herself
into
the
reeds
she
tried
to
run
and
in
a
moment
was
in
water
up
to
her
hips
frantically
battering
at
the
tall
water
grasses
she
struggled
to
keep
going
the
mist
was
beginning
to
swallow
her
up
too
surprised
to
move
white
bear
stood
watching
her
for
a
moment
she
would
surely
die
out
there
in
the
marsh
and
she
did
realize
it
he
plunged
into
the
marsh
after
her
he
drove
his
legs
through
the
cold
water
the
mud
sucked
at
his
moccasins
by
the
time
he
caught
up
with
her
he
was
barefoot
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
she
thrashed
about
turned
and
struck
at
his
face
with
her
fists
her
eyes
were
wild
like
a
trapped
fox
her
cheeks
bright
red
her
mouth
twisted
and
quivering
i
got
to
get
away
nancy
you
ca
they
were
waist
deep
in
water
and
he
felt
his
feet
sinking
into
the
mud
he
grabbed
her
shoulders
and
shook
her
as
hard
as
he
could
listen
to
me
she
went
limp
in
his
arms
and
he
had
to
hold
her
up
i
ca
stay
here
i
wo
let
them
kill
me
he
pulled
her
toward
dry
ground
the
cold
water
swirling
around
them
slimy
mud
tugging
at
their
feet
when
they
were
out
of
the
water
dripping
he
said
if
there
were
any
way
you
could
escape
from
here
i
help
you
if
you
try
to
get
away
you
die
there
are
miles
of
swamp
in
every
direction
only
black
hawk
and
a
few
braves
know
the
way
out
you
drown
or
be
buried
alive
in
quicksand
or
the
warriors
would
catch
you
and
they
would
kill
you
no
matter
what
i
did
and
they
kill
me
if
i
help
you
try
to
escape
i
die
if
i
stay
here
her
eyes
were
dull
with
hopelessness
no
you
wo
i
take
care
of
you
my
family
will
protect
you
redbird
sun
woman
owl
carver
iron
knife
you
be
safe
with
me
she
leaned
against
him
auguste
i
ca
bear
being
so
frightened
my
heart
is
so
full
of
fear
it
will
burst
the
band
will
not
free
you
but
they
will
not
hurt
you
they
respect
me
i
talk
to
the
spirits
for
them
and
heal
them
she
took
a
long
look
at
him
and
spoke
more
calmly
you
look
so
strange
dressed
like
a
like
a
like
a
real
indian
he
tried
giving
her
a
little
smile
for
an
instant
a
little
life
came
back
into
her
face
can
heal
her
fear
too
if
she
will
let
he
felt
an
inward
glow
as
she
managed
to
return
a
tremulous
smile
she
said
but
you
still
that
fine
young
gentleman
who
charmed
me
so
back
at
victor
are
you
yes
i
that
man
too
he
looked
down
at
her
bare
feet
you
lost
your
moccasins
we
must
get
you
another
pair
and
she
was
lucky
not
to
have
a
leech
or
two
clinging
to
her
feet
so
was
he
his
moccasins
were
lost
too
clothing
would
be
hard
to
come
by
with
the
band
on
the
run
in
strange
country
but
he
need
not
make
her
feel
worse
by
telling
her
that
i
have
to
resign
myself
to
staying
with
your
people
do
i
she
asked
thank
god
you
here
auguste
maybe
it
was
providence
that
your
uncle
stole
your
estate
from
you
earthmaker
way
is
he
thought
one
thing
i
must
ask
of
you
nancy
for
your
protection
you
and
i
must
go
through
a
wedding
ceremony
then
no
one
will
be
allowed
to
bother
you
a
wedding
she
let
go
of
him
and
stepped
away
quickly
his
heartbeat
quickened
with
anxiety
over
her
apparent
shock
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
a
simple
ceremony
he
recalled
his
wedding
to
redbird
last
fall
he
might
be
a
shaman
but
he
not
had
the
slightest
premonition
that
he
would
go
through
the
same
ceremony
with
a
different
woman
less
than
a
year
later
but
you
already
have
a
wife
that
pretty
little
woman
who
is
expecting
she
reddened
you
told
me
she
was
your
wife
soaking
wet
she
turned
forlornly
away
from
him
in
our
tribe
men
may
have
more
than
one
wife
he
expected
to
see
contempt
in
her
eyes
her
pale
eyes
morality
outraged
instead
she
said
sadly
is
she
the
reason
you
would
not
do
what
i
wanted
the
night
you
left
victor
were
you
married
to
her
even
then
he
had
to
force
the
words
out
no
but
i
did
love
her
even
then
and
she
that
boy
you
seen
in
our
wickiup
he
is
our
son
he
was
born
after
my
father
took
me
to
victoire
she
shook
her
head
the
blond
braids
swinging
you
were
honest
with
me
you
did
tell
me
about
redbird
but
you
did
make
a
fool
of
me
as
another
man
might
have
a
man
like
your
uncle
but
how
does
your
wife
feel
about
me
what
did
she
mean
man
like
your
had
raoul
approached
her
he
put
that
question
aside
while
he
framed
an
answer
to
her
question
redbird
agrees
to
this
wedding
she
too
wants
to
help
you
if
you
are
part
of
our
family
you
will
be
protected
she
wants
that
she
stared
at
him
but
i
a
christian
i
ca
go
through
a
pagan
wedding
ceremony
to
be
your
how
could
i
do
that
to
my
father
a
minister
he
tried
to
sound
reassuring
we
will
all
know
you
and
i
and
redbird
that
it
is
not
a
real
marriage
i
no
doubt
your
christian
god
will
see
and
understand
and
your
father
if
he
sees
you
surely
he
wants
you
to
live
philip
hale
as
i
remember
him
might
well
expect
her
to
die
for
her
faith
he
might
well
want
his
daughter
to
join
him
in
the
other
world
but
never
he
went
on
quickly
of
course
you
will
not
have
to
know
me
as
your
bible
says
in
the
sight
of
the
tribe
you
will
be
my
wife
that
is
all
in
our
wickiup
your
virtue
will
be
respected
she
laughed
ruefully
but
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
oh
auguste
remember
how
i
begged
you
to
marry
me
i
even
prayed
for
it
would
you
have
imagined
that
and
now
my
prayer
has
been
answered
only
it
did
turn
out
exactly
the
way
i
hoped
did
it
white
bear
heart
filled
up
with
a
dark
foreboding
nothing
had
turned
out
as
any
of
them
hoped
but
much
had
happened
as
they
feared
uncle
sam
men
tears
filled
raoul
eyes
blurring
the
newspaper
and
the
letter
on
his
candlelit
camp
table
his
hands
were
cold
as
a
corpse
as
he
pressed
them
against
the
sides
of
his
head
god
a
drink
i
need
a
drink
he
reached
for
the
jug
beside
the
letter
a
hand
lifted
the
tent
flap
and
eli
greenglove
slouched
in
the
sight
of
him
frightened
raoul
did
he
know
yet
not
much
chance
there
be
a
letter
for
eli
in
the
sack
of
mail
that
had
just
caught
up
with
raoul
battalion
no
one
in
victor
likely
to
write
to
eli
not
now
eli
mouth
was
drawn
hard
it
was
a
hot
night
and
he
wore
no
jacket
only
a
plain
brown
calico
work
shirt
with
a
pistol
and
a
knife
at
his
wide
brown
belt
levi
pope
got
a
letter
from
his
missuz
there
was
an
injun
raid
on
victor
you
hear
anything
eli
voice
was
as
flat
as
the
prairie
he
sat
on
raoul
camp
trunk
yes
raoul
said
choking
on
the
single
word
a
war
party
attacked
victoire
he
took
a
swallow
from
the
jug
a
cold
aching
space
was
growing
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
the
whiskey
settled
in
the
middle
of
the
ache
like
a
tiny
campfire
in
the
middle
of
a
blizzard
he
handed
the
jug
to
eli
and
eli
sipped
and
put
the
jug
back
on
the
table
goddammit
do
just
sit
there
staring
at
me
eli
displayed
his
ruined
teeth
as
his
lip
curled
back
in
a
snarl
hell
happened
raoul
picked
up
the
letter
in
a
shaking
hand
and
read
aloud
horrible
words
written
in
a
flowing
black
script
is
my
sad
duty
as
your
sister
to
send
you
the
news
that
clarissa
greenglove
and
your
two
sons
have
perished
at
the
hands
of
indians
oh
lord
god
an
savior
eli
groaned
his
head
fell
back
on
his
neck
his
mouth
open
his
adam
apple
stuck
out
that
our
beloved
victoire
has
burned
to
the
ground
raoul
went
on
clarissa
and
andrew
and
philip
along
with
other
people
who
lived
at
victoire
and
in
victor
were
murdered
on
the
morning
of
june
seventeenth
in
your
sorrow
may
it
comfort
you
to
know
that
your
fortified
trading
post
where
we
took
shelter
and
defended
ourselves
saved
the
lives
of
most
of
us
the
cannon
that
you
set
in
the
blockhouse
was
employed
to
good
effect
even
though
we
hesitated
at
first
to
use
it
since
no
one
here
knew
how
to
fire
such
a
weapon
nevertheless
fire
it
we
did
and
broke
the
indians
last
charge
and
drove
them
off
burke
russell
whom
you
placed
in
charge
of
the
trading
post
was
killed
whilst
fighting
on
the
parapet
david
cooper
whom
you
also
appointed
as
caretaker
gave
us
the
leadership
and
strength
we
badly
needed
to
see
us
through
he
was
the
only
experienced
fighting
man
among
us
i
can
not
bear
to
write
more
the
sights
we
saw
when
we
came
out
of
the
blockhouse
will
haunt
my
dreams
forever
though
the
indians
could
not
lay
hands
on
our
bodies
they
destroyed
our
property
our
house
was
burned
down
and
our
printing
press
and
woodworking
machines
ruined
when
it
was
all
over
frank
rode
to
galena
though
i
begged
him
not
to
for
fear
there
were
indians
yet
lurking
about
but
he
must
needs
publish
his
paper
he
arranged
to
have
an
edition
of
the
printed
on
the
press

kids
murdered
by

oh
christ
jesus
eli
said
he
shook
his
head
then
resting
his
elbows
on
his
knees
pressed
his
hands
to
the
top
of
his
head
papa
had
to
raoul
heart
felt
bruised
as
if
beaten
with
a
hammer
do
not
reproach
that
was
reproach
enough
he
had
taken
every
man
who
would
sign
up
for
the
militia
he
had
promised
them
their
wives
and
children
would
be
safe
he
led
them
away
in
pursuit
of
black
hawk
vengeance
and
glory
eli
looked
up
what
does
it
say
in
the
newspaper
raoul
started
to
hand
it
to
him
you
read
it
to
me
raoul
had
forgotten
that
eli
could
read
clarissa
could
either
now
she
never
learn
nor
would
the
boys
he
shook
his
head
and
brushed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
i
read
this
out
loud
greenglove
eyes
were
hard
as
bullets
you
wipe
your
damned
eyes
and
read
that
damned
newspaper
raoul
rubbed
his
eyes
and
took
another
pull
from
the
jug
greenglove
held
out
his
hand
and
raoul
passed
him
the
jug
raoul
picked
up
the
newspaper
hating
the
sight
of
it
and
began
to
read
the
column
headed
with
the
single
word
massacre
frank
story
told
how
the
people
in
the
trading
post
held
the
indians
off
all
day
and
finally
drove
them
away
by
firing
the
cannon
then
came
the
grievous
task
of
finding
and
burying
those
who
had
not
had
time
to
reach
safety
then
for
raoul
the
most
dreadful
lines
of
all
in
the
ashes
of
victoire
it
appeared
from
examination
of
the
charred
remains
that
the
skulls
of
the
men
and
women
had
been
cloven
by
tomahawk
blows
parts
of
the
children
bodies
were
scattered
about
the
ruins
as
if
they
had
been
chopped
to
bits
before
the
indians
set
fire
to
the
great
house
why
had
clarissa
gotten
away
she
taken
to
drinking
heavily
in
the
last
year
so
much
so
that
he
had
to
hit
her
more
than
once
for
letting
the
boys
run
loose
without
keeping
an
eye
on
them
she
had
probably
been
lying
abed
in
a
drunken
stupor
while
everyone
was
fleeing
the
château
the
boys
sleeping
in
the
room
with
her
had
anyone
tried
to
wake
them
those
faithful
french
servants
who
loved
elysée
and
pierre
so
much
they
did
give
a
damn
about
raoul
whore
and
his
bastard
sons
after
all
he
had
thwarted
pierre
dying
wishes
and
he
had
struck
his
aged
father
with
his
fist
in
front
of
all
those
victoire
people
still
they
have
been
human
enough
to
try
to
do
if
had
time
they
holler
and
bang
on
the
door
try
to
wake
them
up
but
there
would
have
been
time
a
hundred
or
more
indians
galloping
down
on
the
château
the
servants
who
saw
them
coming
would
barely
have
time
to
get
away
some
of
them
had
made
it
some
of
them
had
died
with
clarissa
and
the
boys
maybe
the
ones
who
stayed
behind
to
try
to
warn
them
that
was
how
it
must
have
been
frank
article
in
the
said
that
some
of
the
people
in
the
distant
farms
had
saved
themselves
by
hiding
in
root
cellars
or
in
nearby
woods
the
indians
were
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
get
to
victor
to
bother
searching
carefully
one
family
the
flemings
had
ridden
to
the
lead
mine
some
indians
pursued
them
to
the
mine
but
did
follow
them
in
the
flemings
hid
so
deep
in
the
mine
they
had
trouble
finding
their
way
out
again
but
they
did
survive
but
one
person
had
neither
hidden
nor
been
killed
while
the
body
of
the
reverend
philip
hale
was
found
in
the
burnt
wreckage
of
his
house
his
daughter
miss
nancy
hale
has
not
been
found
it
is
feared
miss
hale
may
have
been
kidnapped
by
the
indians
both
the
church
and
the
house
reverend
hale
built
on
the
prairie
were
burned
down
as
raoul
read
aloud
the
list
of
the
dead
he
thought
of
nancy
and
then
of
his
sister
helene
did
they
do
to
nancy
the
red
devils
probably
did
horrible
he
saw
the
naked
slashed
violated
body
lying
on
the
prairie
nancy
hale
body
just
like
helene
but
it
could
be
too
she
was
alive
and
if
he
kept
after
black
hawk
he
might
be
the
one
to
rescue
her
there
was
comfort
in
that
a
little
comfort
and
then
a
black
bile
of
hatred
for
himself
trickled
up
into
his
throat
great
god
in
heaven
this
man
he
was
sitting
with
he
had
this
daughter
in
his
bed
for
six
years
and
now
she
was
murdered
and
already
he
was
figuring
how
to
replace
her
i
am
as
bad
a
man
as
papa
said
i
what
nicole
meant
by
all
happens
as
god
ordains
this
was
to
punish
he
took
a
drink
to
wash
that
thought
away
he
winced
when
he
came
to
the
name
marchette
perrault
on
the
list
of
dead
maybe
she
had
died
trying
to
help
clarissa
did
armand
know
yet
eli
stood
up
well
poor
clarissa
poor
little
boys
it
was
a
black
day
in
our
lives
when
clarissa
and
me
met
up
with
you
raoul
de
marion
the
words
tore
at
a
wound
that
was
fresh
and
bleeding
look
here
now
eli
do
you
know
that
i
feel
as
bad
as
you
do
no
i
do
know
that
clarissa
was
all
i
had
in
the
world
i
kept
hoping
you
find
it
in
your
heart
to
marry
her
but
you
never
treated
her
decent
never
cared
enough
for
them
kids
to
give
them
your
name
your
brother
he
did
more
for
that
son
of
his
than
you
did
for
your
two
that
was
all
white
white
they
were
but
half
raoul
thought
feeling
his
disdain
for
the
man
who
stood
slumped
before
him
puke
a
good
nickname
for
greenglove
breed
missouri
puked
up
the
worst
of
its
people
and
they
landed
in
illinois
clarissa
breasts
flattening
and
sagging
her
shoulders
round
her
teeth
stained
by
pipe
smoke
so
slatternly
she
gotten
to
be
he
hardly
cared
to
take
her
to
bed
and
phil
and
andy
growing
up
with
that
same
greenglove
look
could
i
think
that
way
about
my
own
kids
what
kind
of
a
man
am
i
and
now
they
been
murdered
and
i
still
despising
he
had
to
quit
this
he
was
torturing
himself
was
it
bad
enough
it
was
the
goddamned
indians
he
should
be
hating
we
have
our
revenge
eli
we
kill
a
hundred
indians
for
each
of
ours
who
died
like
you
murdered
them
three
at
old
man
creek
i
warned
you
not
to
do
that
that
was
what
got
clarissa
and
her
kids
killed
i
wo
be
helping
you
get
your
vengeance
colonel
raoul
de
marion
because
if
i
did
stay
around
you
sooner
or
later
i
want
blood
for
blood
of
mine
that
been
spilled
raoul
felt
a
chill
facing
greenglove
implacable
hatred
but
he
was
damned
if
he
back
down
before
this
human
weed
you
leave
this
company
when
your
term
of
enlistment
is
up
and
not
one
damned
day
sooner
you
captain
of
the
smith
county
company
greenglove
mouth
curled
in
a
cold
smile
by
tomorrow
there
wo
be
any
company
the
smith
county
boys
heard
about
what
happened
at
victor
most
of
them
be
quitting
raoul
felt
the
heat
rising
in
his
neck
and
head
the
hell
they
will
my
smith
county
boys
will
want
indian
blood
just
like
i
do
and
just
like
you
would
if
you
had
taken
a
notion
to
blame
clarissa
death
on
me
auguste
the
raoul
felt
his
blood
boiling
as
he
saw
the
face
mingling
pierre
features
with
indian
looks
the
face
he
never
stopped
hating
from
the
moment
he
first
saw
it
auguste
was
dead
eli
here
had
shot
him
his
body
was
rotting
away
somewhere
on
the
prairie
behind
them
but
the
indians
of
the
british
band
were
alive
auguste
people
they
snuck
up
on
victoire
raoul
home
burned
it
to
the
ground
tomahawked
his
woman
chopped
his
children
his
two
boys
andy
and
phil
to
pieces
to
pieces
he
saw
that
for
a
moment
too
vividly
and
almost
screamed
he
grabbed
the
jug
and
burned
the
bloody
picture
out
of
his
mind
with
a
swallow
auguste
band
skulking
around
up
the
river
somewhere
why
auguste
might
have
given
them
the
idea
told
them
all
about
victoire
and
victor
lots
of
helpless
women
and
children
there
a
rich
trading
post
a
big
white
man
house
to
burn
down
uncle
kicked
me
off
the
auguste
might
have
said
me
go
kill
his
woman
and
his
children
and
burn
his
house
down
and
while
you
at
it
kill
every
one
of
those
white
dogs
in
smith
sure
he
probably
put
the
idea
in
those
devils
heads
before
he
got
shot
it
had
been
enough
to
kill
auguste
was
enough
he
had
to
kill
off
every
last
one
of
black
hawk
indians
exterminate
the
whole
band
bucks
squaws
and
papooses
and
he
would
shoot
any
shirker
who
refused
to
go
with
him
greenglove
shrugged
go
chase
injuns
then
if
that
your
desire
then
he
smiled
in
a
knowing
way
raoul
found
strangely
disturbing
but
you
maybe
find
a
surprise
waiting
for
you
up
there
in
michigan
territory
almost
makes
me
want
to
stay
with
you
just
i
could
see
the
look
on
your
face
raoul
felt
a
chill
why
the
hell
was
greenglove
grinning
like
that
damn
you
you
ca
just
walk
off
eli
you
took
an
oath
you
signed
up
for
another
thirty
days
when
your
enlistment
was
up
in
may
i
can
have
you
shot
for
desertion
go
ahead
shoot
me
yourself
eli
slowly
raised
the
tent
flap
and
stood
there
a
moment
turning
to
give
raoul
one
last
strange
unmirthful
smile
raoul
eyed
the
pistol
at
eli
belt
most
likely
all
primed
and
loaded
his
own
pistol
unloaded
was
hanging
from
a
tent
pole
behind
him
i
went
for
my
pistol
that
give
him
an
excuse
to
put
a
ball
in
me
and
he
do
it
before
i
could
even
get
a
damned
cap
in
eli
gave
raoul
one
final
nod
as
if
he
knew
what
raoul
had
been
thinking
and
let
the
tent
flap
fall
behind
him
raoul
reached
for
the
jug
it
felt
light
in
his
hand
and
he
shook
it
empty
everything
empty
empty
empty
he
got
up
weaving
slightly
and
walked
to
the
opening
of
the
tent
armand
he
shouted
my
god
now
i
have
to
give
armand
the
news
about
raoul
awakened
sweating
one
side
of
his
tent
was
glowing
white
the
sun
beating
down
on
it
he
had
been
sleeping
in
an
oven
he
sat
up
and
his
vision
went
black
and
his
head
spun
he
swung
his
feet
still
in
dirty
gray
stockings
over
the
side
of
his
cot
he
nearly
stepped
on
armand
who
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
on
the
floor
his
beard
fluttering
as
he
snored
through
his
open
mouth
standing
raoul
saw
nicole
letter
and
the
lying
on
his
camp
table
beside
a
candle
and
four
empty
jugs
he
remembered
what
had
happened
at
victor
he
fell
back
onto
his
cot
and
pounded
his
fist
on
his
chest
trying
to
numb
the
pain
in
his
heart
damn
the
sauk
damn
them
damn
them
armand
when
he
learned
what
happened
at
victoire
had
not
blamed
raoul
as
eli
had
he
wept
over
marchette
whom
he
beaten
almost
daily
when
she
was
alive
and
had
sworn
vengeance
on
her
murderers
the
british
band
and
he
had
sat
with
raoul
till
both
of
them
were
drunk
enough
to
sleep
raoul
head
and
body
felt
as
if
they
were
on
fire
his
fingers
curled
grasping
at
empty
air
he
buckled
on
his
belt
with
his
pistol
and
his
bowie
knife
stumbled
out
of
his
tent
and
stood
beside
it
pissing
in
the
tall
grass
he
was
facing
the
rock
river
less
than
a
wide
here
a
sheet
of
sparkling
blue
water
bordered
by
forest
lined
up
along
the
bank
before
him
were
a
dozen
big
flatboats
the
tents
of
his
own
militia
battalion
and
of
two
others
were
spread
over
the
grassland
around
him
he
suddenly
sensed
that
something
was
wrong
he
had
heard
the
bugler
blow
the
dozen
notes
signaling
the
start
of
the
day
he
saw
now
that
the
men
were
assembled
but
were
wandering
aimlessly
about
the
camp
what
the
hell
was
it
greenglove
had
said
tomorrow
there
wo
be
any
down
near
the
flatboats
a
big
crowd
was
gathered
one
man
standing
on
a
barrel
was
addressing
them
his
voice
shrill
and
insistent
carried
to
raoul
on
the
warm
june
air
but
he
could
make
out
what
the
man
was
saying
raoul
did
like
this
he
did
like
this
at
all
he
started
walking
toward
the
river
and
found
levi
pope
and
hodge
hode
squatting
in
front
of
a
fire
making
coffee
simply
by
boiling
water
with
coffee
grounds
in
it
sorry
for
your
loss
colonel
said
pope
hearing
pope
speak
of
what
happened
at
victoire
was
like
being
kicked
in
a
spot
that
was
already
bruised
raoul
had
to
pause
a
moment
before
he
could
speak
thank
you
your
family
come
through
all
right
he
dreaded
what
he
might
hear
in
answer
your
sister
wrote
a
letter
for
my
missuz
pope
said
they
came
through
tolerably
thanks
to
the
way
you
fortified
the
trading
post
that
was
mighty
foresighted
colonel
raoul
chest
expanded
and
he
felt
a
little
better
this
was
how
hoped
the
men
would
react
not
blaming
him
for
the
tragedy
as
that
bastard
greenglove
had
levi
letter
told
as
how
my
boy
josiah
made
it
to
the
trading
post
too
hodge
said
cooper
even
let
him
do
some
shootin
at
the
redskins
cooper
since
when
did
david
cooper
get
to
be
so
high
and
mighty
i
need
some
of
that
coffee
raoul
said
hodge
strained
the
grounds
out
of
the
coffee
by
pouring
it
through
a
kerchief
into
a
tin
cup
and
handed
the
cup
to
raoul
the
black
liquid
scalded
raoul
lips
and
tongue
and
did
treat
him
any
better
when
it
bit
into
his
stomach
anything
to
eat
with
a
bitter
grunt
levi
pope
took
a
square
biscuit
out
of
a
paper
wrapper
and
held
it
out
these
worm
cakes
is
pretty
lively
but
dip
in
the
coffee
a
couple
of
times
and
you
boil
the
little
buggers
to
death
raoul
shut
his
eyes
and
waved
the
hardtack
away
what
the
hell
is
that
bunch
doing
down
by
the
river
hodge
hode
grinned
they
call
it
a
meeting
he
drawled
out
the
words
amused
say
they
wo
go
across
the
river
into
michigan
territory
say
they
want
to
go
home
any
of
our
men
talking
that
way
oh

heap
of
them
colonel
said
levi
i
see
about
that
hodge
and
me
ai
quittin
we
wo
go
home
till

killed
us
some
injun
trash
levi
lovingly
stroked
the
handles
of
his
six
holstered
pistols
three
on
each
side
of
his
belt
but
levi
and
hodge
made
no
move
to
get
up
and
join
raoul
they
would
go
with
him
across
the
river
he
saw
but
they
were
not
about
to
help
him
discipline
the
other
men
he
thought
of
ordering
them
to
come
with
him
but
decided
not
to
test
their
loyalty
that
far
eli
had
walked
out
on
him
he
did
know
who
he
could
trust
hell
he
could
do
it
without
these
two
anyway
for
reassurance
raoul
took
a
grip
on
the
handle
of
his
bowie
knife
as
he
approached
the
crowd
could
he
cow
dozens
of
men
if
they
were
determined
not
to
obey
him
might
have
to
carve
a
few
bellies
but
the
rest
will
fall
into
that
was
how
he
ran
smith
county
the
man
standing
on
the
barrel
was
saying
you
know
what
the
injuns
call
that
country
up
there
the
trembling
lands
it
all
swamp
water
and
quicksand
you
take
a
horse
out
on
what
looks
like
solid
ground
before
you
can
blink
he
sinks
belly
deep
that
kind
of
talk
made
raoul
want
to
use
his
knife
but
that
would
probably
only
rile
these
rebellious
bastards
all
the
more
to
put
a
stop
to
this
line
them
all
up
by
the
boats
tell
the
first
man
to
get
in
if
he
wo
shoot
him
then
go
on
to
the
next
that
change
their
minds
in
a
he
told
himself
disgustedly
to
quit
dreaming
not
even
in
smith
county
could
he
get
away
with
shooting
white
men
just
because
they
obey
him
not
in
broad
daylight
anyway
the
man
standing
on
the
barrel
said
if
black
hawk
has
holed
up
in
that
country
that
means
he
finished
hell
his
people
will
starve
to
death
up
there
what
do
we
got
to
follow
him
for
pushing
his
way
through
the
crowd
raoul
heard
a
man
near
him
call
out
volunteers
is
what
we
are
that
means
we
serve
at
our
own
pleasure
well
i
not
volunteering
for
any
more
a
chorus
right
yeah
me
neither
that
telling
rose
all
around
raoul
maddening
him
as
a
swarm
of
biting
flies
would
madden
a
horse
he
saw
a
familiar
back
in
the
crowd
justus
bennett
ever
since
old
man
creek
bennett
had
been
whining
about
the
fine
suit
of
clothes
and
the
two
expensive
law
books
he
lost
demanding
that
the
state
of
illinois
pay
for
them
now
he
was
standing
here
encouraging
deserters
just
by
listening
to
them
raoul
grabbed
his
shoulder
and
pulled
him
around
you
a
lawyer
you
know
damned
well
this
meeting
is
illegal
get
over
there
with
pope
and
hode
or
you
no
more
a
lieutenant
in
my
battalion
bennett
stared
back
at
him
with
beady
eyes
that
immaterial
seeing
as
we
all
going
home
no
one
going
home
said
raoul
loud
enough
to
make
the
men
around
him
turn
to
look
get
the
hell
back
to
your
outfit
he
gave
bennett
a
shove
the
lawyer
glowered
at
him
but
slunk
away
raoul
pushed
his
way
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
the
men
fell
back
making
way
for
his
blue
jacket
with
its
officer
gold
stripes
but
the
sun
beat
down
on
his
head
he
realized
that
he
had
forgotten
to
put
on
his
hat
and
he
was
shaved
and
his
jacket
was
unbuttoned
and
nothing
hell
he
could
handle
men
he
did
have
to
dress
up
for
that
he
drew
his
knife
and
faced
the
man
on
the
barrel
get
down
off
there
now
listen
colonel
this
is
a
public
meeting
raoul
waved
the
knife
you
had
your
say
jump
the
man
stared
defiantly
at
raoul
raoul
thought
he
might
have
to
cut
him
up
a
little
and
wondered
if
he
was
up
to
it
the
man
eyes
wavered
from
raoul
down
to
the
blade
and
he
jumped
but
he
was
quite
done
talking
it
a
free
country
colonel
got
a
right
to
speak
his
mind
raoul
said
tell
that
to
black
hawk
he
was
quite
sure
what
he
meant
by
that
but
he
heard
several
chuckles
and
was
encouraged
he
scrambled
up
on
the
barrel
it
rocked
under
him
and
the
dregs
of
whiskey
sloshing
around
in
his
body
made
him
feel
dizzy
he
decided
after
he
got
his
feet
set
near
the
rim
of
the
barrel
that
he
would
be
safer
if
he
sheathed
his
knife
you
men
term
of
enlistment
is
not
up
any
man
who
wo
cross
that
river
is
a
coward
and
a
deserter
and
i
see
you
dealt
with
go
to
hell
one
man
shouted
you
talk
about
cowards
another
man
called
did
your
whole
battalion
run
all
the
way
from
old
man
creek
to
dixon
ferry
from
forty
injun
bucks
they
do
call
it
old
man
creek
no
more
a
raucous
voice
cried
now
it
de
marion
run
raoul
pulled
his
knife
again
the
man
who
said
that
about
de
marion
run
come
up
here
and
say
it
again
he
shook
the
knife
quit
wavin
that
pig
sticker
around
and
get
down
off
that
barrel
de
marion
we
heard
enough
from
you
raoul
saw
a
rifle
pointed
at
him
the
blood
pumping
through
his
body
suddenly
went
from
hot
to
cold
a
new
voice
broke
in
lower
that
rifle
the
tone
was
deep
easy
and
confident
in
command
it
offered
no
alternative
the
rifle
came
down
as
quickly
as
if
in
response
to
a
drill
sergeant
order
a
short
plump
officer
with
thick
black
eyebrows
came
up
to
stand
beside
raoul
barrel
he
wore
a
stained
wool
hat
and
a
blue
army
jacket
over
fringed
buckskin
trousers
the
gold
stripes
on
his
upper
arm
identified
him
as
a
colonel
the
saber
at
his
side
nearly
dragged
on
the
ground
he
might
have
been
comical
looking
but
somehow
he
was
raoul
had
seen
the
officer
at
command
meetings
and
knew
that
despite
his
mixed
dress
he
was
regular
army
this
morning
though
he
could
remember
his
name
movement
in
the
distance
caught
raoul
eye
a
long
line
of
troops
was
marching
across
the
prairie
about
a
hundred
yards
away
their
shakoes
bobbing
they
came
to
a
halt
turned
and
faced
the
militiamen
they
came
to
parade
rest
each
man
with
a
rifle
at
his
side
the
morning
sun
glittered
on
bayonets
some
militiamen
glanced
over
their
shoulders
at
the
line
of
federal
soldiers
and
a
nervous
muttering
of
bluebellies
spread
through
the
crowd
you
can
get
down
from
there
now
colonel
de
marion
said
the
short
officer
i
appreciate
it
if
you
let
me
handle
this
raoul
hated
to
admit
it
to
himself
but
he
was
relieved
crouching
slowly
and
carefully
so
as
not
to
make
an
ass
of
himself
by
falling
he
climbed
down
from
the
barrel
that
zachary
taylor
raoul
heard
someone
in
the
crowd
say
as
he
moved
now
unnoticed
to
stand
apart
on
the
riverbank
raoul
felt
foolish
that
he
had
forgotten
taylor
name
especially
when
taylor
knew
his
instead
of
standing
on
the
barrel
taylor
hitched
himself
up
and
sat
on
it
gesturing
in
a
friendly
way
to
the
men
to
gather
around
him
he
spoke
with
an
easy
southern
drawl
but
he
made
his
voice
carry
now
men
i
do
set
myself
up
as
your
superior
even
though
i
am
a
federal
officer
we
all
equal
americans
here
he
nodded
as
if
thinking
something
over
in
fact
many
of
you
are
important
men
in
civilian
life
and
i
have
no
doubt
some
of
you
will
hold
public
office
and
be
giving
orders
to
some
day
raoul
eyes
traveled
over
the
crowd
and
he
noticed
one
figure
taller
than
most
eyes
grave
as
he
listened
intently
to
taylor
that
lincoln
fellow
who
had
been
such
a
nuisance
at
prophet
town
raoul
wondered
if
the
young
man
was
for
or
against
crossing
the
rock
river
today
taylor
said
the
best
assurance
you
have
that
i
obey
your
orders
when
it
comes
your
turn
is
that
i
obeying
the
orders
i
got
now
i
will
tell
you
in
a
moment
what
those
orders
are
but
let
me
refresh
your
memory
about
what
black
hawk
and
his
savages
have
done
to
the
people
you
and
i
are
sworn
to
defend
he
pulled
a
folded
paper
from
the
side
pocket
of
his
blue
jacket
and
read
from
it
one
man
killed
at
bureau
creek
one
man
at
buffalo
grove
another
at
the
fox
river
two
on
the
checagou
road
a
woman
and
two
men
killed
on
the
outskirts
of
galena
apple
river
fort
besieged
four
dead
seven
men
massacred
at
kellogg
grove
three
whole
families
fifteen
people
wiped
out
at
indian
creek
victor
besieged
and
seventeen
men
women
and
children
massacred
raoul
saw
the
shamefaced
glances
of
men
who
knew
him
shift
his
way
he
looked
down
at
the
ground
angrily
he
did
want
these
men
pitying
him
but
an
image
of
burned
and
scattered
flesh
and
bones
reared
up
suddenly
in
his
mind
it
struck
at
him
like
a
rattlesnake
he
almost
threw
up
he
clenched
his
fists
and
held
himself
rigid
one
man
called
out
colonel
taylor
that
why
we
do
want
to
cross
the
state
line
the
indians
are
attacking
all
over
the
place
and
we
want
to
be
back
home
to
protect
our
people
taylor
nodded
that
understandable
but
i
been
fighting
indians
for
a
long
time
i
came
up
against
old
black
hawk
nearly
twenty
years
ago
in
the
war
against
the
british
i
got
a
score
to
settle
with
him
because
he
whipped
me
then
and
i
promise
you
he
will
not
whip
this
time
yes
that
wild
country
up
there
no
doubt
about
it
but
have
a
band
of
potawatomi
scouts
led
by
one
of
their
chiefs
billy
caldwell
to
guide
us
and
general
winfield
scott
is
coming
across
the
great
lakes
with
five
hundred
more
federal
troops
with
all
that
help
we
finish
black
hawk
and
we
must
finish
him
the
murders
and
massacres
will
not
stop
as
long
as
black
hawk
and
his
tribe
are
on
the
loose
if
you
go
back
to
your
farms
and
settlements
there
be
a
dozen
of
you
in
one
place
and
twenty
in
another
and
one
morning
or
night
you
find
yourself
facing
a
war
party
of
a
hundred
hundred
fifty
braves
like
the
people
at
apple
river
and
victor
did
our
strength
is
in
our
numbers
and
while
we
are
three
thousand
and
more
together
we
got
to
seek
out
the
british
band
of
the
sauk
and
fox
and
destroy
them
raoul
heard
a
murmur
of
assent
his
heart
lifted
the
little
colonel
was
winning
them
over
and
the
war
would
go
on
in
plain
english
gentlemen
and
fellow
citizens
my
orders
from
washington
city
are
to
pursue
black
hawk
wherever
he
goes
and
to
take
the
illinois
militia
with
me
i
mean
to
do
both
now
there
are
the
flatboats
drawn
up
on
the
shore
he
paused
then
slid
down
from
his
perch
on
the
barrel
and
standing
very
straight
pointed
over
their
heads
and
here
are
uncle
sam
men
drawn
up
behind
you
on
the
prairie
taylor
was
so
short
that
only
the
men
near
him
could
see
where
he
was
pointing
they
turned
first
and
then
in
an
ring
the
men
in
the
farther
reaches
of
the
crowd
turned
to
look
at
the
long
line
stretched
behind
them
like
a
chain
raoul
heard
resignation
in
the
militiamen
voices
boys
i
for
the
flatboats
me
too
i
signed
up
to
fight
injuns
not
americans
a
man
called
out
hell
colonel
we
uncle
sam
men
taylor
smiled
reached
up
to
settle
his
mottled
hat
on
his
head
and
said
then
i
will
be
proud
to
lead
you
he
strode
through
the
assembly
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
he
turned
and
raised
his
voice
officers
assemble
your
men
we
take
the
troops
over
first
then
the
horses
i
want
everyone
on
the
other
side
by
noon
taylor
walked
over
to
raoul
squinted
at
him
and
sniffed
audibly
you
look
like
the
backside
of
hell
sir
you
been
drinking
this
early
in
the
day
i
have
touched
whiskey
this
morning
raoul
said
not
adding
that
it
was
only
because
when
he
woke
up
all
the
jugs
in
his
tent
were
empty
well
then
you
were
drinking
damned
late
last
night
appearing
in
front
of
these
unruly
men
looking
like
a
sot
is
no
way
to
get
them
to
obey
you
raoul
eyed
the
short
colonel
mismatched
uniform
parts
and
wondered
where
he
got
the
gall
to
criticize
but
he
wanted
to
be
on
this
good
side
my
wife
and
two
sons
were
murdered
by
the
redskins
at
victor
been
dead
for
two
weeks
and
i
just
found
out
about
it
last
night
taylor
reached
out
and
gripped
his
arm
damn
i
am
sorry
colonel
de
marion
i
should
have
realized
you
might
have
lost
loved
ones
there
i
see
that
get
leave
to
go
home
back
to
victor
raoul
trembled
at
the
thought
of
having
to
see
the
ruins
of
victoire
and
the
town
the
graves
of
clarissa
and
phil
and
andy
having
to
face
people
who
like
eli
might
believe
that
he
put
them
in
harm
way
besides
he
had
a
mission
to
carry
out
kill
indians
and
there
were
no
indians
to
kill
in
victor
now
no
colonel
no
he
stammered
i
want
to
go
after
black
people
we
ca
let
them
get
away
nor
will
we
general
atkinson
and
i
were
talking
about
that
just
yesterday
and
about
you
as
it
happens
you
own
a
mississippi
steamboat
do
you
puzzled
raoul
answered
yes
the
it
makes
a
regular
run
from
louis
to
galena
we
certain
that
if
we
do
catch
up
with
black
hawk
wherever
hiding
up
in
the
michigan
territory
that
he
try
to
take
his
band
west
to
the
mississippi
if
he
gets
across
it
we
have
a
hell
of
a
time
catching
him
taylor
eyes
glinted
hard
as
glass
marbles
we
are
determined
colonel
not
to
allow
him
to
make
a
successful
retreat
we
have
to
show
all
the
tribes
that
they
ca
murder
white
people
and
then
light
out
for
indian
country
and
get
off
taylor
words
now
that
the
was
over
lifted
raoul
heart
he
had
left
victor
in
april
hoping
for
revenge
for
helene
and
for
his
own
sufferings
of
years
ago
but
now
there
were
more
slaughtered
innocents
to
avenge
and
now
he
had
the
army
of
the
united
states
to
help
him
do
it
i
do
anything
to
get
those
redskins
with
your
ship
patrolling
the
stretch
of
river
where
they
likely
to
cross
we
could
be
sure
that
black
hawk
wo
escape
us
you
want
me
to
go
back
and
get
the
ready
he
felt
himself
trembling
again
for
now
you
go
along
with
us
into
the
michigan
territory
taylor
said
but
if
it
looks
as
if
black
hawk
is
making
a
run
for
the
mississippi
you
see
that
we
cut
them
off
the
eh
aptly
named
raoul
grieving
vengeful
heart
rejoiced
when
the
time
came
he
have
the
cannon
from
the
trading
post
mounted
in
the
bow
of
the
then
let
any
damned
indians
try
to
cross
the
mississippi
he
pay
them
back
for
what
they
did
to
victoire
but
he
remembered
nicole
and
frank
coming
to
him
telling
him
the
militia
was
needed
to
guard
victor
he
laughed
at
their
fears
if
listened
to
them
clarissa
and
andy
and
phil
and
those
other
people
might
still
be
alive
victoire
and
victor
would
still
be
standing
had
he
had
some
hand
in
bringing
death
and
destruction
upon
his
home
no
it
was
all
the
indians
doing
get
you
black
hawk
if
i
have
to
follow
you
all
the
way
to
hudson
bay
there
wo
be
a
one
of
your
damned
british
band
left
alive
when
i
he
would
make
them
suffer
from
this
moment
on
he
had
only
one
thing
to
think
of
and
only
one
thing
to
do
kill
indians
book
moon
of
strawberries
the
trembling
lands
redbird
thought
land
by
the
rock
river
was
so
good
to
us
and
now
see
what
we
have
come
only
starving
people
tried
to
make
food
from
cattail
seeds
and
the
inner
bark
of
slippery
elm
and
willow
trees
with
a
small
steel
knife
redbird
cut
cattails
dropping
them
into
a
basket
she
carried
over
her
arm
it
would
take
thousands
of
the
tiny
seeds
painstakingly
picked
from
the
white
fuzz
and
then
ground
into
meal
to
make
a
little
bread
that
must
be
shared
among
five
people
redbird
moved
slowly
pushing
her
swollen
belly
before
her
as
much
as
her
back
and
her
feet
hurt
she
was
determined
to
spend
every
day
out
foraging
until
the
baby
was
born
for
the
baby
sake
she
had
to
eat
as
much
as
she
could
but
she
did
not
want
to
take
that
extra
portion
from
the
rest
of
her
family
without
contributing
as
much
as
she
could
to
the
common
supply
she
sang
as
she
walked
along
asking
the
trembling
lands
to
yield
fruits
and
berries
she
found
no
fruits
or
berries
but
singing
kept
her
spirits
up
and
she
thought
it
helped
the
others
too
yellow
hair
smiled
and
nodded
to
her
to
show
that
she
liked
the
song
sweat
trickled
down
her
back
and
inside
her
doeskin
dress
gray
clouds
lay
heavily
over
the
trembling
lands
and
the
air
was
warm
and
wet
even
though
the
water
of
the
lake
was
dark
and
muddy
redbird
was
looking
forward
to
bathing
in
it
and
she
was
looking
forward
to
a
private
talk
with
yellow
hair
yellow
hair
had
been
with
them
for
many
days
and
nights
it
was
time
she
went
to
bed
with
white
bear
yellow
hair
walked
beside
her
around
the
edge
of
the
lake
ahead
of
them
ran
eagle
feather
with
a
captive
pale
eyes
boy
named
woodrow
iron
knife
had
brought
woodrow
back
from
a
raid
and
white
bear
had
taken
him
under
his
protection
too
woodrow
a
few
years
older
than
eagle
feather
was
darting
this
way
and
that
uprooting
plants
and
throwing
them
down
tasting
berries
and
spitting
them
out
redbird
watched
him
with
amusement
she
had
already
grown
fond
of
him
woodrow
said
something
to
yellow
hair
who
smiled
and
turned
to
redbird
speaking
the
pale
eyes
tongue
slowly
adding
the
few
sauk
words
she
knew
and
using
gestures
yellow
hair
managed
to
explain
to
redbird
that
woodrow
was
unhappy
because
he
did
not
know
what
to
pick
if
look
good
pick
redbird
said
using
the
little
english
white
bear
had
taught
her
not
eat
if
i
say
good
then
eat
woodrow
grinned
and
nodded
to
redbird
to
show
he
understood
he
ran
off
after
eagle
feather
who
was
looking
for
birds
and
squirrels
to
shoot
with
his
small
bow
and
arrow
woodrow
had
been
a
captive
only
half
as
long
as
yellow
hair
but
unlike
her
he
seemed
happy
with
his
lot
redbird
doubted
that
eagle
feather
and
woodrow
would
find
any
squirrels
or
birds
very
little
that
was
edible
plant
or
animal
lived
in
this
marsh
and
over
a
thousand
people
had
been
foraging
in
the
area
for
more
than
a
moon
the
last
time
the
british
band
had
eaten
well
was
when
wolf
paw
brought
the
cattle
and
among
so
many
people
those
cattle
had
not
lasted
long
many
people
were
digging
in
the
ground
for
worms
and
grubs
roasting
them
and
eating
them
in
handfuls
some
people
were
even
secretly
killing
and
eating
horses
though
black
hawk
had
decreed
death
for
anyone
caught
doing
that
as
for
redbird
herself
she
felt
an
emptiness
in
her
belly
from
the
time
she
woke
till
the
time
she
went
to
sleep
and
she
found
herself
wanting
to
sleep
longer
and
longer
as
her
strength
ebbed
away
she
worried
constantly
that
the
baby
inside
her
was
not
getting
enough
nourishment
and
would
die
or
be
stunted
the
people
around
her
were
starting
to
look
like
walking
skeletons
they
came
to
a
point
of
land
covered
with
pale
green
shrubs
thrusting
out
into
the
lake
redbird
called
eagle
feather
go
for
a
swim
around
the
other
side
of
this
point
and
take
the
pale
eyes
boy
with
you
eagle
feather
blue
eyes
glowed
maybe
i
can
shoot
a
frog
once
the
boys
were
gone
she
said
to
yellow
hair
we
take
bath
yellow
hair
smiled
gratefully
as
they
waded
naked
into
the
greenish
murky
water
redbird
eyed
yellow
hair
body
so
different
from
a
sauk
woman
she
remembered
how
hungrily
the
braves
had
stared
at
yellow
hair
when
wolf
paw
wife
stripped
her
before
the
tribe
yet
it
was
easy
to
imagine
that
such
pale
skin
was
a
sign
of
sickness
yellow
hair
face
and
hands
were
somewhat
tan
but
every
other
part
of
her
was
white
as
milk
her
ribs
were
showing
a
sign
of
the
hunger
they
were
all
suffering
still
her
breasts
were
round
with
pretty
pink
nipples
her
legs
were
long
and
her
buttocks
curved
out
sharply
those
of
sauk
women
were
flatter
even
though
the
hair
under
her
arms
and
between
her
legs
was
light
in
color
she
had
an
abundance
of
it
much
more
than
the
fine
tufts
of
black
hair
redbird
had
in
those
places
she
had
undone
her
braids
and
her
hair
fell
like
a
golden
curtain
down
her
back
halfway
to
her
waist
a
beautiful
creature
she
is
what
an
evil
stupid
thing
it
would
have
been
if
running
deer
and
the
others
had
been
allowed
to
cut
her
to
bits
and
burn
her
a
man
might
find
yellow
hair
differences
from
sauk
women
attractive
a
man
such
as
white
bear
she
felt
no
fear
that
the
pale
eyes
woman
would
take
white
bear
away
from
her
he
showed
many
times
every
day
with
his
looks
with
his
movements
with
his
words
that
redbird
and
not
yellow
hair
was
first
in
his
heart
redbird
waded
into
the
lake
until
the
water
was
up
to
her
breasts
and
her
feet
were
sinking
in
the
ooze
then
she
pushed
herself
forward
and
through
the
reeds
it
was
wonderful
to
let
the
water
take
the
weight
of
her
belly
off
her
hips
and
legs
a
welcome
relief
to
feel
so
cool
in
the
night
in
the
wickiup
she
often
heard
yellow
hair
moving
or
weeping
softly
and
that
meant
that
yellow
hair
must
have
heard
white
bear
and
redbird
loving
each
other
in
bed
this
was
only
to
be
expected
when
families
slept
all
together
in
lodges
and
wickiups
the
children
early
came
to
know
how
their
parents
took
pleasure
together
during
the
night
and
were
unembarrassed
when
they
grew
up
and
their
turn
came
but
how
did
the
sounds
of
white
bear
and
redbird
together
make
yellow
hair
feel
white
bear
had
said
that
yellow
hair
had
wanted
him
when
he
lived
among
the
pale
eyes
and
lately
redbird
and
white
bear
had
been
sleeping
apart
on
their
separate
pallets
more
often
because
redbird
in
the
discomfort
of
the
final
moon
of
carrying
this
baby
rarely
wanted
white
bear
inside
her
and
so
redbird
had
searched
her
heart
and
knew
that
she
was
willing
to
share
her
husband
with
yellow
hair
white
bear
and
yellow
hair
could
go
to
bed
with
each
other
and
should
it
would
be
good
for
yellow
hair
if
her
yearning
for
white
bear
could
be
satisfied
at
least
for
a
time
the
pleasure
of
mating
was
a
healing
thing
it
restored
the
ill
to
health
and
it
made
the
well
strong
and
happy
redbird
could
see
in
yellow
hair
eyes
such
a
bright
blue
how
much
she
longed
for
white
bear
being
close
to
him
redbird
thought
helped
yellow
hair
forget
she
was
a
captive
some
days
ago
not
long
after
white
bear
had
taken
in
woodrow
redbird
had
told
white
bear
she
would
not
mind
if
he
took
yellow
hair
into
his
bed
he
had
laughed
and
patted
her
belly
and
insisted
he
could
wait
until
she
wanted
him
again
why
should
he
to
wait
when
a
woman
who
desired
him
was
right
there
in
his
wickiup
it
was
good
that
she
had
spoken
to
him
even
though
he
claimed
he
did
not
want
yellow
hair
at
least
he
knew
that
if
yellow
hair
did
come
to
him
in
the
night
they
both
had
redbird
blessing
but
she
doubted
that
yellow
hair
would
ever
approach
white
bear
that
way
not
without
encouragement
she
stopped
swimming
and
let
her
feet
down
into
the
mud
so
that
she
stood
beside
yellow
hair
here
the
water
of
the
lake
almost
came
up
to
redbird
shoulders
but
yellow
hair
breasts
were
well
above
it
they
smiled
at
each
other
yellow
hair
crouched
down
in
the
water
till
it
was
up
to
her
neck
she
dipped
her
hair
into
the
water
then
lifted
her
head
and
squeezed
the
water
out
of
her
hair
with
her
hands
the
water
was
good
and
cool
she
said
but
she
wished
she
had
some
soap
white
bear
had
explained
what
soap
was
and
redbird
smiled
and
shook
her
head
if
water
would
not
wash
dirt
away
a
sauk
scrubbed
with
sand
as
for
hair
redbird
left
hers
braided
once
at
the
beginning
of
summer
and
once
at
the
end
she
felt
was
often
enough
to
let
water
touch
her
unbound
hair
now
that
she
had
decided
to
talk
to
yellow
hair
redbird
felt
a
tightness
in
her
throat
what
if
the
idea
of
sharing
white
bear
made
yellow
hair
angry
sharing
a
mate
was
not
redbird
knew
according
to
pale
eyes
custom
there
was
only
one
way
to
begin
in
spite
of
her
fear
she
said
you
know
about
woman
and
man
what
they
do
she
signed
with
her
fingers
to
make
her
meaning
plain
and
saw
that
she
had
succeeded
when
the
pale
eyes
woman
face
turned
a
deep
red
redbird
wished
yellow
hair
were
standing
up
in
the
water
so
she
could
see
whether
the
rest
of
her
body
turned
red
too
yellow
hair
said
she
knew
a
little
about
what
men
and
women
did
but
her
mother
had
died
a
long
time
ago
and
her
father
never
spoke
of
such
things
you
want
me
teach
redbird
asked
yellow
hair
turned
red
again
looked
down
at
the
water
and
nodded
so
as
they
waded
back
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
redbird
tried
with
many
gestures
and
a
few
words
to
teach
yellow
hair
as
sun
woman
many
summers
ago
had
taught
her
when
they
were
out
of
the
water
redbird
picked
up
a
stick
and
drew
a
little
picture
on
the
mudbank
when
she
was
finished
she
giggled
yellow
hair
took
a
good
look
and
turned
red
again
all
the
way
down
to
her
waist
redbird
noticed
she
turned
away
but
redbird
saw
to
her
relief
that
she
was
laughing
redbird
scratched
out
the
picture
they
sat
on
the
bank
where
they
had
left
their
clothing
letting
the
air
dry
their
bodies
from
a
pouch
she
had
brought
with
her
redbird
took
a
gourd
containing
musk
oil
she
and
yellow
hair
rubbed
the
oil
on
their
bodies
to
keep
mosquitoes
off
yellow
hair
wanted
to
know
if
the
first
time
with
a
man
hurt
very
much
some
women
hurt
much
other
women
little
she
patted
yellow
hair
wrist
to
reassure
her
i
think
you
hurt
little
after
that
feel
very
very
good
she
patted
herself
between
her
legs
to
make
plain
what
she
was
talking
about
and
yellow
hair
blushed
again
feeling
redbird
added
smiling
it
was
surprising
redbird
thought
that
yellow
hair
could
become
a
fully
grown
woman
and
yet
still
have
her
first
time
with
a
man
to
look
forward
to
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
time
redbird
afraid
again
because
now
she
had
to
take
the
next
step
but
before
she
could
speak
tears
began
to
trickle
down
yellow
cheeks
she
spoke
brokenly
and
it
was
hard
for
redbird
to
follow
her
she
seemed
to
be
saying
that
she
expected
to
die
before
she
ever
knew
those
good
feelings
redbird
talked
about
with
a
man
she
loved
she
had
already
lived
for
twenty
summers
and
now
it
seemed
she
might
not
live
much
longer
and
never
have
a
man
it
was
true
there
was
big
danger
to
yellow
hair
if
anything
happened
to
white
bear
she
would
have
no
protector
many
sauk
hated
pale
eyes
one
might
get
at
her
or
her
own
people
might
even
kill
her
by
mistake
yellow
hair
had
missed
so
much
so
tall
and
beautiful
but
she
had
nothing
to
show
for
her
life
no
man
no
children
redbird
felt
sorry
for
her
you
love
white
bear
she
asked
hugging
herself
as
she
said
the
word
love
to
show
what
she
meant
now
yellow
hair
turned
pale
even
paler
than
usual
and
drew
away
from
redbird
she
shook
her
head
violently
her
bright
golden
hair
swinging
all
wild
and
loose
and
said
no
no
no
but
she
stared
at
redbird
too
fixedly
and
redbird
could
see
that
she
did
not
mean
what
she
said
white
bear
wanted
yellow
hair
but
said
he
did
not
want
her
yellow
hair
loved
white
bear
but
said
she
did
not
love
him
white
bear
and
yellow
hair
were
both
being
foolish
it
came
of
yellow
hair
being
pale
eyes
and
white
bear
being
part
pale
eyes
and
so
now
redbird
took
a
deep
breath
and
said
when
we
sleep
tonight
you
go
to
bed
of
white
bear
he
make
you
happy
yellow
hair
eyes
grew
huge
and
her
face
glowed
with
a
joyous
wonder
she
stammered
and
gasped
as
she
asked
redbird
if
she
really
meant
it
if
she
would
really
let
such
a
thing
happen
i
happy
when
you
happy
white
bear
happy
redbird
said
redbird
had
come
to
see
yellow
hair
as
a
younger
sister
who
needed
her
help
and
guidance
she
liked
yellow
hair
much
more
in
fact
than
she
liked
either
wild
grape
or
robin
nest
her
sisters
had
always
sneered
at
white
bear
and
yellow
hair
saw
what
a
fine
man
he
was
yellow
hair
suddenly
looked
frightened
she
stood
up
abruptly
picked
up
her
fringed
doeskin
dress
and
struggled
into
it
when
her
head
appeared
through
the
neck
of
the
dress
and
she
shook
her
hair
free
she
was
crying
again
no
she
insisted
she
could
do
that
it
would
be
wrong
redbird
thought
she
understood
this
hungry
dangerous
time
was
a
terrible
time
for
a
woman
to
be
carrying
a
baby
you
not
want
baby
sun
woman
makes
tea
keeps
woman
from
getting
baby
yellow
hair
talked
for
a
long
time
redbird
tried
hard
to
follow
what
she
said
asking
questions
and
making
her
repeat
herself
it
had
to
do
with
jesus
the
pale
eyes
spirit
père
isaac
always
talked
about
jesus
would
not
like
it
if
yellow
hair
went
to
bed
with
white
bear
redbird
remembered
white
bear
telling
her
that
yellow
hair
was
the
daughter
of
a
pale
eyes
shaman
the
jesus
spirit
might
be
a
special
spirit
for
her
then
i
am
also
the
daughter
of
a
shaman
i
can
teach
her
what
we
jesus
not
here
redbird
pointed
out
we
children
of
earthmaker
but
also
yellow
hair
explained
by
pale
eyes
custom
a
woman
who
slept
with
another
woman
husband
was
a
bad
woman
white
bear
your
husband
redbird
said
my
father
shaman
he
marry
you
and
white
bear
surely
that
was
more
important
than
what
a
lot
of
pale
eyes
who
were
not
even
here
to
see
might
think
among
the
sauk
many
would
call
yellow
hair
a
bad
woman
for
sleeping
with
white
bear
we
sauk
people
what
you
do
with
my
sauk
man
is
good
yellow
hair
sighed
and
wiped
her
tears
with
her
fingers
maybe
she
would
go
to
white
bear
in
the
night
and
maybe
not
she
spread
her
hands
helplessly
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
redbird
saw
that
she
could
tell
yellow
hair
no
more
the
pale
eyes
would
have
to
make
up
her
own
mind
yellow
hair
gave
redbird
a
sad
smile
and
thanked
her
for
her
kindness
and
after
redbird
had
put
on
her
dress
and
her
moccasins
yellow
hair
gave
her
a
little
kiss
on
the
cheek
with
a
wooden
comb
redbird
had
given
her
yellow
hair
combed
out
her
long
blond
locks
and
began
to
braid
them
again
they
rejoined
eagle
feather
and
woodrow
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
searching
for
food
returning
to
camp
when
the
clouds
overhead
turned
purple
and
the
sun
made
a
brief
appearance
blazing
like
a
prairie
fire
on
the
flat
horizon
of
the
marshland
redbird
bit
her
lip
anxiously
as
they
walked
back
to
the
camp
if
yellow
hair
decided
not
to
go
to
bed
with
white
bear
she
might
think
according
to
her
pale
eyes
custom
that
redbird
was
a
bad
woman
for
saying
she
should
but
what
if
yellow
hair
went
to
bed
with
white
bear
and
he
came
to
love
yellow
hair
more
than
he
did
redbird
she
had
thought
that
could
not
happen
but
now
that
she
had
spoken
out
she
was
not
so
sure
that
night
redbird
curled
up
on
her
solitary
pallet
of
blankets
laid
over
a
mat
of
reeds
on
one
side
of
the
wickiup
yellow
hair
lay
in
her
sleeping
place
and
the
boys
were
in
the
one
they
shared
white
bear
was
still
visiting
and
treating
ill
people
many
people
especially
the
very
old
and
the
very
young
were
falling
ill
in
the
trembling
lands
there
had
been
many
deaths
since
they
crossed
the
great
river
bit
by
bit
the
band
was
losing
the
wisdom
of
the
old
and
the
promise
of
the
young
white
bear
came
in
long
after
the
two
women
and
the
boys
had
settled
down
for
the
night
he
went
to
his
own
pallet
on
the
east
side
of
the
wickiup
now
that
redbird
was
ready
for
sleep
the
baby
within
her
woke
up
and
its
kicking
along
with
burning
feelings
that
rose
from
her
stomach
to
her
throat
kept
her
awake
the
stillness
was
disturbed
only
by
the
chirping
of
countless
frogs
were
those
frogs
today
when
we
were
looking
for
food
we
must
ask
the
frog
spirit
to
let
us
catch
some
of
then
she
heard
another
movement
someone
was
crawling
across
the
floor
of
the
wickiup
she
caught
her
breath
yellow
sleeping
place
was
on
the
side
opposite
white
bear
and
the
movement
was
unmistakably
from
her
bed
to
his
a
little
later
she
heard
other
sounds
that
were
also
easy
to
recognize
the
crackling
of
a
bed
reed
matting
whispers
little
gasps
and
groans
loud
fast
breathing
yellow
hair
cry
of
pain
sounded
as
if
it
had
come
through
clenched
teeth
she
still
did
not
want
anyone
to
know
redbird
smiled
to
herself
as
she
listened
to
white
bear
heavy
panting
redbird
remembered
the
sharp
pain
inside
her
when
she
first
received
him
on
the
island
near
saukenuk
white
bear
sighed
loudly
and
then
everything
was
still
for
a
time
and
redbird
heard
the
frogs
once
more
they
were
probably
mating
too
how
wise
of
earthmaker
to
make
his
creatures
into
woman
and
man
so
they
could
give
each
other
such
wonderful
pleasure
earthmaker
knew
everything
but
it
was
hard
to
see
how
he
could
have
invented
man
and
woman
without
having
seen
something
that
gave
him
the
idea
him
redbird
had
always
pictured
earthmaker
as
a
man
a
giant
warrior
but
now
she
wondered
whether
the
spirit
that
gave
life
to
the
world
and
all
things
in
it
might
be
a
she
or
better
yet
maybe
there
were
two
earthmakers
a
he
and
a
she
as
she
had
so
many
times
before
she
wished
now
that
the
tribe
custom
would
permit
her
to
become
a
shaman
so
that
she
might
see
into
these
mysteries
with
her
own
eyes
as
white
bear
and
owl
carver
had
the
sounds
started
up
again
from
white
bear
bed
the
movements
the
whisperings
redbird
thought
about
how
good
it
was
to
have
her
man
filling
her
solidly
giving
her
delicious
feelings
as
he
moved
in
and
out
and
she
felt
herself
warm
with
desire
she
smiled
ruefully
in
the
dark
i
want
him
and
i
can
not
have
him
because
i
sent
yellow
hair
to
his
hope
this
baby
will
be
born
soon
so
i
can
lie
with
white
bear
again
of
course
even
then
i
will
still
let
yellow
hair
have
him
when
redbird
awoke
at
sunrise
and
got
up
to
begin
the
day
foraging
yellow
hair
was
back
sleeping
in
her
own
place
in
the
faint
light
that
filtered
through
the
wickiup
skin
her
pink
mouth
looked
soft
and
childlike
white
bear
was
seated
on
his
bed
loading
the
rifle
he
had
brought
with
him
when
he
came
back
to
the
tribe
with
food
so
short
even
the
shaman
had
to
go
out
and
try
to
hunt
to
supply
his
family
the
people
he
treated
had
no
gifts
to
give
him
she
stood
looking
at
him
waiting
for
him
to
speak
to
her
but
he
kept
his
eyes
on
his
rifle
with
foolish
shyness
did
he
think
she
was
angry
at
him
or
that
she
was
going
to
tease
him
the
way
water
flows
fast
might
poor
water
flows
fast
she
made
few
jokes
since
her
husband
three
horses
was
killed
at
old
man
creek
redbird
said
i
know
what
happened
last
night
i
am
glad
that
it
happened
it
was
good
for
her
and
for
you
now
white
bear
dark
eyes
met
hers
troubled
yes
it
is
good
for
me
and
nancy
yellow
hair
but
only
for
now
what
troubles
you
she
asked
him
one
day
when
yellow
hair
must
leave
us
and
go
back
to
her
own
people
i
think
she
will
be
very
sad
that
is
why
i
did
not
lie
with
her
when
she
wanted
me
to
at
victor
i
knew
we
would
have
to
part
now
she
has
what
she
wants
at
least
for
as
long
as
she
stays
with
us
now
she
will
have
something
to
think
about
besides
how
afraid
she
is
he
smiled
at
her
and
you
made
it
happen
i
know
that
you
sent
her
to
me
you
are
a
great
troublemaker
he
stood
up
and
stroked
her
cheek
with
his
fingertips
and
she
felt
a
glow
inside
certain
now
that
speaking
to
yellow
hair
had
been
right
the
afternoon
sun
heated
the
interior
of
the
birthing
wickiup
till
it
felt
like
a
sweat
lodge
redbird
screamed
it
was
not
a
baby
it
was
a
wild
horse
down
there
kicking
its
way
out
she
felt
about
to
faint
the
pain
died
away
groaning
redbird
went
limp
between
wind
bends
grass
and
yellow
hair
who
held
her
arms
sun
woman
crouched
before
redbird
observing
the
progress
of
the
birth
by
the
light
of
a
single
candle
her
skin
slick
with
sweat
redbird
was
squatting
naked
over
a
pile
of
blankets
in
the
center
of
the
wickiup
her
back
and
legs
ached
unbearably
you
do
have
to
scream
so
loud
wind
bends
grass
said
abruptly
it
does
hurt
that
much
redbird
wished
her
mother
could
feel
this
pain
and
know
how
much
it
hurt
she
felt
like
telling
wind
bends
grass
to
leave
the
birthing
wickiup
sun
woman
said
gently
no
one
knows
how
much
another
person
hurts
do
remember
this
much
pain
when
eagle
feather
was
born
maybe
i
am
going
to
sun
woman
stood
up
and
wiped
redbird
forehead
with
a
cool
wet
kerchief
then
cleaned
her
bottom
for
her
where
a
little
blood
was
dripping
i
can
see
the
top
of
the
baby
head
sun
woman
said
it
will
be
a
good
birth
you
are
almost
done
now
redbird
looked
up
at
the
mare
tail
dyed
red
that
hung
over
the
wickiup
doorway
medicine
to
make
the
birth
go
easier
it
be
over
she
prayed
her
pains
had
started
at
dawn
and
now
it
was
past
midday
sun
woman
had
used
up
four
candles
and
in
the
whole
band
there
were
hardly
any
candles
left
it
had
not
taken
this
long
with
eagle
feather
yellow
hair
rubbed
the
arm
she
was
holding
and
redbird
managed
to
look
at
her
and
smile
though
redbird
had
meant
to
honor
yellow
hair
by
asking
her
to
help
here
she
was
not
sure
now
that
she
had
done
the
right
thing
the
pale
eyes
woman
face
was
icy
white
and
she
kept
biting
her
lips
as
if
trying
to
keep
from
being
sick
she
had
probably
never
seen
anything
like
this
before
wind
bends
grass
had
insisted
that
it
was
bad
luck
to
have
yellow
hair
present
but
redbird
had
ignored
her
the
next
pain
came
and
redbird
to
show
her
mother
how
much
it
hurt
screamed
even
louder
and
longer
than
she
had
to
this
time
the
pain
gave
her
hardly
any
rest
before
it
came
again
and
another
came
stepping
on
its
heels
and
another
her
screams
were
continuous
now
and
she
was
hoarse
and
coughing
and
did
not
have
to
pretend
her
eyes
were
blind
with
tears
she
dug
her
nails
into
the
arms
of
wind
bends
grass
and
yellow
hair
and
bent
forward
pushing
as
hard
as
she
could
she
felt
the
enormous
mass
breaking
out
of
her
and
found
her
voice
again
in
a
scream
that
could
split
the
very
sky
open
even
as
the
baby
was
tearing
her
in
two
her
ears
rang
she
felt
broken
and
useless
like
an
empty
eggshell
she
hurt
terribly
but
a
great
weight
was
gone
from
inside
her
wind
bends
grass
said
you
have
done
well
my
daughter
redbird
started
to
cry
from
pain
from
relief
and
because
she
had
finally
pleased
her
mother
from
the
floor
she
heard
a
tiny
cough
and
then
a
wail
she
looked
down
and
saw
the
little
bright
red
figure
in
sun
woman
arms
its
eyes
screwed
shut
its
mouth
wide
open
at
the
joining
of
its
legs
the
crevice
a
glistening
blue
cord
coiling
up
from
the
baby
belly
joined
her
still
to
redbird
body
she
felt
another
pain
now
and
pushed
out
the
afterbirth
with
a
groan
wind
bends
grass
and
yellow
hair
helped
her
to
stumble
to
the
bed
against
the
wall
of
the
wickiup
they
wrapped
her
in
a
light
blanket
while
sun
woman
cut
the
cord
and
set
it
aside
to
be
dried
and
put
in
the
baby
medicine
bag
then
wind
bends
grass
bathed
the
tiny
body
first
with
water
then
with
oil
she
put
her
granddaughter
in
her
arms
what
will
you
call
her
she
asked
redbird
had
thought
of
a
name
in
the
lake
where
she
and
yellow
hair
had
been
bathing
several
days
ago
i
will
call
her
floating
lily
a
good
name
sun
woman
said
floating
lily
voice
was
strong
hungry
already
and
she
had
only
been
in
the
world
a
few
moments
redbird
pressed
the
little
mouth
against
her
breast
she
prayed
that
she
would
have
milk
she
had
eaten
as
much
as
she
could
now
she
must
give
nourishment
she
felt
the
rhythmic
pull
on
her
breast
the
baby
mouth
was
full
of
milk
no
more
crying
a
warm
feeling
spread
through
redbird
body
after
redbird
had
fed
floating
lily
they
both
slept
it
was
near
sundown
when
the
three
women
attending
her
helped
her
limp
with
the
baby
back
to
her
own
wickiup
each
time
she
took
a
step
it
felt
as
if
a
club
hit
her
between
her
legs
but
her
heart
rejoiced
that
the
ordeal
was
over
yellow
hair
said
that
she
would
go
and
look
for
woodrow
and
eagle
feather
she
was
crying
redbird
was
not
sure
why
in
the
wickiup
white
bear
was
waiting
for
her
as
she
lay
on
her
bed
with
floating
lily
his
eyes
lit
up
with
joy
at
the
sight
of
his
daughter
he
picked
the
baby
up
which
made
her
cry
and
he
laughed
and
handed
her
back
to
redbird
i
was
not
with
you
to
see
our
son
born
he
said
i
have
never
been
happier
in
my
life
than
i
am
at
this
moment
the
hide
curtain
over
the
wickiup
doorway
was
pulled
aside
and
owl
carver
entered
holding
his
owl
head
medicine
stick
in
one
hand
and
a
bowl
of
smoking
aromatic
herbs
and
wood
shavings
in
another
his
white
hair
was
getting
thinner
and
thinner
redbird
noticed
and
he
walked
with
a
permanent
stoop
he
blew
the
smoke
over
redbird
and
floating
lily
to
bless
them
may
she
walk
her
path
with
honor
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
floating
lily
head
he
left
the
scented
smoke
lingering
behind
him
when
redbird
bared
her
breast
white
bear
leaned
over
and
kissed
her
nipple
his
lips
catching
a
droplet
of
milk
that
had
formed
there
she
put
floating
lily
to
her
breast
and
lay
in
contented
silence
with
her
husband
sitting
beside
her
he
took
up
his
book
and
read
aloud
whence
hail
to
thee
eve
rightly
called
mother
of
all
mankind
mother
of
all
things
living
since
by
thee
man
is
to
live
and
all
things
live
for
man
what
does
that
mean
she
asked
he
translated
the
words
into
sauk
and
said
it
means
that
all
life
comes
from
woman
iron
knife
head
suddenly
appeared
in
the
doorway
his
eyes
wide
his
mouth
drawn
down
white
bear
long
knives
coming
this
way
thousands
of
them
redbird
body
went
cold
and
she
clutched
the
baby
to
her
how
could
she
keep
this
tender
new
life
safe
in
the
midst
of
flight
and
fighting
maybe
they
will
not
be
able
to
find
us
white
bear
said
no
the
scouts
say
they
have
potawatomi
guides
riding
with
them
who
know
where
to
look
for
us
potawatomi
dogs
to
side
with
the
long
knives
against
us
the
potawatomi
must
have
been
forced
to
help
said
white
bear
quietly
iron
knife
said
black
hawk
says
we
must
break
camp
right
now
we
will
head
west
as
quickly
as
we
can
toward
the
great
river
redbird
tightened
her
arms
around
floating
lily
until
the
baby
cried
out
in
pain
instantly
she
relaxed
her
grip
but
in
her
mind
she
saw
the
long
knives
coming
with
their
cruel
hairy
faces
murdering
them
all
with
their
guns
and
their
swords
she
saw
the
people
she
loved
sprawled
dead
in
the
mud
of
the
trembling
lands
white
bear
had
told
her
that
black
hawk
war
parties
had
killed
many
pale
eyes
even
women
and
children
now
the
long
knives
would
take
terrible
vengeance
even
as
she
stroked
the
baby
and
whispered
to
soothe
her
her
heart
pounded
in
her
chest
there
would
be
hard
traveling
ahead
and
even
less
food
thought
redbird
trying
to
walk
after
just
giving
birth
the
pain
would
kill
her
for
an
instant
she
hated
black
hawk
for
having
led
them
into
this
suffering
if
only
the
british
band
had
listened
last
winter
to
white
bear
and
to
her
then
hatred
gave
way
to
sick
despair
she
would
die
before
they
ever
reached
the
great
river
and
floating
lily
who
had
just
come
into
the
world
would
die
too
iron
knife
left
them
white
bear
turned
to
redbird
and
she
saw
in
his
eyes
the
same
hopelessness
she
felt
but
if
he
gave
up
too
they
were
truly
lost
why
then
go
through
the
agony
of
a
flight
from
the
long
knives
they
might
as
well
stay
here
and
let
the
long
knives
come
and
kill
them
white
bear
said
the
turtle
told
me
many
who
follow
black
hawk
across
the
great
river
will
be
few
when
they
cross
back
a
chill
went
through
her
as
she
saw
how
those
prophetic
words
were
coming
true
the
little
bundle
in
redbird
arms
stirred
anger
rose
in
her
despite
black
hawk
blundering
despite
the
deadly
hatred
of
the
long
knives
she
and
her
husband
and
her
son
and
her
baby
daughter
would
not
let
themselves
be
killed
then
if
we
do
not
cross
the
great
river
we
will
escape
in
some
other
direction
she
said
firmly
go
and
find
eagle
feather
and
woodrow
i
will
start
to
pack
our
belongings
he
smiled
gratefully
at
her
reached
for
her
and
held
her
she
felt
herself
gaining
strength
from
his
strong
arms
around
her
for
a
few
days
i
will
not
be
able
to
walk
or
ride
you
will
have
to
tie
me
to
a
travois
and
pull
me
along
as
we
do
with
old
people
if
i
have
to
carry
you
in
my
arms
said
white
bear
i
will
do
that
now
that
she
was
determined
to
fight
to
stay
alive
she
smiled
up
at
white
bear
and
pressed
herself
against
him
she
love
the
power
of
a
great
spirit
perhaps
that
she
had
once
thought
of
filled
her
the
turtle
she
thought
had
said
that
many
would
die
but
he
had
also
said
that
a
few
would
live
she
and
her
husband
and
her
children
they
would
live
the
band
divided
the
setting
sun
warming
the
flat
land
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
beside
the
great
river
cast
deep
shadows
in
the
hollows
of
redbird
and
faces
how
thin
they
were
getting
to
be
fear
for
them
wriggled
snakelike
through
white
bear
own
empty
stomach
earthmaker
abandoned
his
people
no
worse
this
is
the
fate
he
has
chosen
for
us
he
bestows
evil
as
well
as
good
on
his
redbird
said
wearily
what
did
the
council
decide
she
unfastened
the
sling
in
which
she
carried
floating
lily
on
her
back
and
cradled
the
baby
in
her
arms
frowning
into
the
tiny
brown
face
white
bear
knew
what
she
was
thinking
floating
lily
was
too
quiet
white
bear
said
black
hawk
wants
to
go
north
and
seek
refuge
with
the
chippewa
he
took
the
compass
my
father
gave
him
out
of
his
medicine
bag
and
showed
it
to
the
chiefs
and
braves
he
said
we
must
follow
its
arrow
north
but
iron
knife
disagreed
with
him
redbird
eyes
widened
my
brother
never
disagrees
with
black
hawk
black
hawk
has
lived
three
times
as
long
as
he
has
iron
knife
spoke
for
many
of
the
younger
braves
white
bear
said
they
want
to
cross
the
great
river
here
now
and
bring
the
war
to
an
end
black
hawk
reminded
them
that
we
have
only
three
canoes
each
canoe
can
hold
only
six
people
and
two
of
those
six
must
paddle
back
and
forth
they
would
have
to
ferry
nearly
a
thousand
people
he
said
the
long
knives
would
reach
us
long
before
we
all
got
across
iron
knife
said
they
would
make
rafts
and
more
canoes
in
the
end
the
three
chiefs
and
most
of
the
braves
said
they
would
cross
the
river
only
a
few
have
agreed
to
go
north
with
black
hawk
it
had
taken
a
whole
moon
to
cross
from
east
to
west
from
their
camp
in
the
trembling
lands
to
this
place
where
the
bad
axe
river
emptied
into
the
great
river
the
land
through
which
they
passed
following
an
old
winnebago
trail
was
rolling
prairie
at
first
then
they
plunged
into
country
that
was
ever
wilder
and
more
mountainous
as
they
struggled
westward
at
the
last
they
had
to
cut
their
own
trail
they
marked
their
passage
with
kettles
blankets
tent
poles
and
other
possessions
too
heavy
to
carry
and
their
dying
old
people
who
could
walk
no
more
and
their
dead
children
the
only
good
thing
about
this
rugged
land
was
that
it
slowed
down
the
long
knives
even
more
than
it
did
black
people
who
knew
by
the
time
they
reached
the
great
river
that
their
pursuers
were
two
days
behind
them
white
bear
told
nancy
in
english
what
he
had
just
told
redbird
about
the
council
if
the
band
is
dividing
where
will
go
nancy
asked
i
asked
black
hawk
i
begged
him
to
let
you
and
woodrow
go
anger
crept
into
white
bear
voice
as
he
recalled
black
hawk
stubbornness
he
still
refuses
he
wants
to
take
the
two
of
you
north
with
him
redbird
said
but
pale
eyes
prisoners
are
no
good
to
black
hawk
now
white
bear
was
pleased
to
see
that
she
had
learned
to
get
the
drift
of
english
conversations
between
him
and
nancy
he
did
not
like
to
feel
that
he
was
leaving
redbird
out
of
anything
especially
since
he
nancy
now
true
white
bear
said
to
redbird
in
sauk
and
if
we
meet
up
with
long
knives
again
they
will
shoot
first
and
not
think
to
look
for
pale
eyes
among
us
i
want
to
get
yellow
hair
and
woodrow
away
from
the
tribe
before
there
is
another
battle
there
had
been
one
great
battle
with
the
long
knives
halfway
through
their
trek
on
the
south
shore
of
the
ouisconsin
river
many
had
died
on
both
sides
but
black
hawk
had
managed
to
get
most
of
his
people
away
after
nightfall
right
now
white
bear
could
almost
hear
the
huge
army
of
long
knives
crashing
through
the
forests
behind
them
but
nancy
shook
her
head
violently
i
feel
safer
with
you
her
eyes
glistened
with
tears
ever
since
redbird
had
encouraged
nancy
to
seek
his
bed
white
bear
had
feared
that
when
the
time
came
for
their
parting
it
would
hurt
her
badly
and
him
as
well
in
the
moon
just
past
he
and
nancy
had
joined
bodies
and
hearts
many
times
now
it
seared
his
throat
to
speak
aloud
his
decision
that
nancy
must
leave
the
british
band
he
sat
down
on
a
fallen
tree
trunk
and
reached
out
to
her
nancy
came
over
and
took
his
hands
and
sat
beside
him
with
the
band
going
in
two
different
directions
this
is
your
best
chance
to
get
away
you
and
i
have
loved
each
other
but
you
are
still
a
white
woman
and
my
people
murdered
your
father
why
should
you
share
our
fate
and
what
about
woodrow
if
you
and
he
go
together
you
have
a
better
chance
of
reaching
safety
she
bent
over
her
shoulders
shaking
with
sobs
if
you
going
to
die
i
want
to
die
with
you
a
moon
ago
he
thought
she
had
desperately
wanted
to
escape
from
the
british
band
now
her
own
heart
was
holding
her
captive
eve
words
to
adam
as
they
left
paradise
rose
unbidden
in
his
mind
thee
to
go
is
to
stay
here
without
thee
here
to
stay
is
to
go
hence
but
no
one
wants
to
die
he
said
gently
for
you
to
stay
now
when
you
can
escape
would
be
madness
it
was
a
madness
he
felt
himself
there
was
a
part
of
him
that
wanted
to
keep
her
with
him
to
let
her
stay
however
all
this
might
end
he
had
to
force
himself
to
keep
to
his
plan
to
help
her
get
away
eagle
feather
and
woodrow
came
from
the
woods
along
the
south
bank
of
the
bad
axe
river
arms
loaded
with
boughs
for
the
wickiup
that
now
they
would
not
bother
to
build
white
bear
squatted
down
before
woodrow
and
grasped
his
shoulders
tonight
i
am
going
to
help
you
and
miss
nancy
to
get
away
from
our
band
and
back
to
the
white
people
he
would
be
sorry
to
lose
the
boy
eagle
feather
standing
nearby
said
nothing
but
his
face
full
of
woe
told
white
bear
that
he
understood
i
guess
miss
nancy
and
me
could
find
our
way
to
white
folks
if
we
follow
the
river
woodrow
said
uncertainly
with
the
beaded
headband
iron
knife
had
given
him
wrapped
around
his
high
forehead
and
his
face
browned
by
the
summer
sun
he
looked
like
a
sauk
boy
except
for
his
light
brown
hair
he
seemed
not
much
happier
about
leaving
the
band
than
nancy
i
not
going
to
send
you
to
find
your
way
alone
white
bear
said
i
go
with
you
until
i
see
you
in
safe
hands
prairie
du
chien
and
fort
crawford
are
south
of
here
on
the
river
if
we
go
in
that
direction
we
bound
to
meet
some
of
your
people
i
got
no
people
but
you
said
woodrow
you
treated
me
better
than
my
folks
ever
did
white
bear
felt
a
catch
in
his
throat
he
remembered
how
seven
years
ago
he
had
fought
against
being
sent
from
the
tribe
when
star
arrow
came
looking
for
him
eagle
feather
blue
eyes
rested
gravely
on
white
bear
what
about
mother
and
floating
lily
and
me
are
we
going
to
cross
the
great
river
now
white
bear
remembered
again
what
the
turtle
had
said
in
his
vision
he
looked
out
at
the
river
tinged
with
red
by
the
sunset
and
felt
a
chill
calamity
his
shaman
sense
told
him
awaited
those
who
tried
to
escape
by
crossing
the
river
again
no
white
bear
looked
over
at
redbird
who
held
floating
lily
to
her
breast
day
after
tomorrow
at
the
latest
the
long
knives
will
be
here
i
want
you
to
go
with
black
hawk
though
i
think
black
hawk
has
led
us
unwisely
still
to
go
north
is
safer
three
lodges
about
fifty
people
are
going
with
black
hawk
owl
carver
flying
cloud
wolf
paw
they
will
follow
him
he
shook
his
head
sadly
what
is
it
redbird
asked
even
wolf
paw
disagrees
with
black
hawk
about
going
north
he
himself
will
remain
at
his
father
side
but
he
is
sending
his
two
wives
and
his
children
across
the
river
he
thinks
they
will
be
safer
i
think
he
is
wrong
he
gazed
out
at
the
reddened
river
and
shook
his
head
again
wolf
paw
made
the
right
choice
for
his
family
said
a
deep
voice
behind
him
white
bear
turned
to
see
iron
knife
huge
figure
silhouetted
by
the
setting
sun
behind
him
trudged
a
much
smaller
shadow
whom
white
bear
recognized
at
once
sun
woman
white
bear
hurried
to
his
mother
put
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
and
led
her
to
the
fallen
tree
to
sit
down
he
could
feel
her
bones
under
her
doeskin
dress
how
is
my
mother
she
patted
his
hand
very
tired
but
alive
are
you
hungry
one
good
thing
about
getting
old
is
that
i
do
not
want
as
much
food
white
bear
felt
immediate
relief
that
they
did
not
have
to
share
their
few
boiled
roots
and
their
bits
of
meal
cake
and
then
he
hated
himself
for
begrudging
food
to
his
own
mother
she
had
said
she
was
not
an
old
woman
from
what
she
had
told
him
he
guessed
her
age
was
less
than
fifty
summers
but
the
woman
before
him
was
terribly
gaunt
and
stooped
the
privations
of
the
moons
just
past
had
aged
her
beyond
her
years
he
felt
a
stone
block
his
throat
as
he
realized
that
his
mother
might
not
have
much
longer
to
live
iron
knife
bent
down
and
hugged
redbird
then
patted
woodrow
head
with
a
big
hand
while
the
boy
looked
up
at
him
with
shining
eyes
it
was
iron
knife
leading
the
war
party
that
had
captured
woodrow
who
had
insisted
the
boy
be
allowed
to
live
like
everyone
else
in
the
band
iron
knife
was
mostly
brown
skin
stretched
over
a
skeleton
but
his
was
a
very
big
skeleton
a
head
taller
than
white
bear
studying
iron
knife
white
bear
wondered
whether
he
could
ask
his
help
in
getting
woodrow
and
nancy
safely
away
iron
knife
said
there
is
no
safety
in
following
black
hawk
he
said
the
british
and
the
potawatomi
and
winnebago
would
join
forces
with
us
and
they
did
not
now
he
says
the
chippewa
will
help
us
he
is
sure
to
be
wrong
again
and
before
he
gets
to
the
chippewa
he
must
travel
through
winnebago
country
for
many
days
and
now
most
of
the
winnebago
are
helping
the
long
knives
hunt
us
sun
woman
said
black
hawk
knows
that
if
we
join
the
rest
of
the
tribe
in
ioway
he
will
no
longer
be
leader
no
doubt
those
who
accepted
he
who
moves
alertly
as
their
chief
have
prospered
as
much
as
we
have
suffered
black
hawk
will
have
to
take
second
place
to
he
who
moves
alertly
that
sticks
in
his
throat
like
a
fishbone
he
would
rather
lead
us
on
and
on
until
we
all
die
white
bear
had
to
force
his
voice
from
a
chest
tight
with
urgency
you
will
not
have
time
to
build
enough
canoes
and
rafts
before
the
long
knives
are
upon
you
and
the
heads
of
the
long
knives
would
be
full
of
names
like
grove
old
man
creek
apple
river
fort
indian
creek
and
victor
and
their
hearts
would
be
ravenous
for
revenge
iron
knife
sat
down
on
the
tree
trunk
beside
sun
woman
and
pointed
at
the
river
if
they
attack
us
before
we
can
cross
we
can
defend
ourselves
on
that
island
white
bear
followed
iron
knife
gesture
the
sun
had
just
set
behind
the
western
hills
and
the
great
river
now
reflected
a
pale
blue
back
at
the
sky
a
long
low
island
covered
with
spruce
and
hemlock
trees
bulked
darkly
an
arrow
flight
from
shore
white
bear
shivered
his
senses
told
him
that
this
was
a
place
of
grief
and
horror
an
isle
of
death
he
did
not
like
the
name
of
this
river
at
whose
mouth
they
were
camped
the
bad
axe
trying
to
ignore
the
rapid
thudding
of
his
heart
white
bear
readied
himself
to
talk
to
iron
knife
about
woodrow
and
nancy
he
hated
having
to
reveal
his
plan
if
iron
knife
was
against
letting
the
two
pale
eyes
escape
all
would
be
lost
he
opened
his
mouth
hesitating
but
he
needed
iron
knife
help
getting
horses
and
avoiding
the
warriors
guarding
the
camp
he
reminded
himself
that
redbird
brother
had
always
given
him
help
when
he
needed
it
he
decided
to
go
ahead
and
talk
to
him
he
said
it
would
not
be
good
for
yellow
hair
and
the
boy
to
cross
the
river
or
to
go
with
black
hawk
i
have
taken
them
into
my
care
and
now
i
am
afraid
for
them
if
there
is
a
battle
the
long
knives
may
kill
them
by
mistake
iron
knife
grunted
i
would
be
sorry
to
see
that
happen
white
bear
heartbeat
steadied
he
felt
more
sure
of
himself
now
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
said
i
have
been
thinking
of
helping
them
to
get
away
iron
knife
smiled
at
white
bear
reached
across
sun
woman
and
patted
his
knee
that
is
well
it
honors
you
my
son
said
sun
woman
white
bear
felt
knots
released
in
his
chest
and
shoulders
i
was
hoping
you
would
see
this
as
i
see
it
i
will
offer
to
watch
the
horses
tonight
iron
knife
said
come
when
you
are
ready
and
i
will
have
three
picked
for
you
sun
woman
said
if
the
long
knives
see
you
with
yellow
hair
and
the
boy
they
will
try
to
shoot
you
white
bear
put
an
arm
around
her
bony
shoulders
and
pulled
her
to
him
there
is
danger
all
around
us
mother
i
think
those
who
follow
black
hawk
to
the
north
will
be
safest
redbird
and
the
children
will
go
that
way
i
think
you
should
too
do
not
try
to
cross
the
great
river
i
have
walked
enough
said
sun
woman
my
legs
ache
and
my
feet
are
bruised
if
i
follow
black
hawk
i
will
end
like
the
old
people
who
sit
down
by
the
trail
and
wait
for
death
i
speak
as
a
shaman
white
bear
said
i
have
a
bad
feeling
about
this
river
crossing
sun
woman
stood
up
and
i
speak
as
a
medicine
woman
i
have
seen
many
kinds
of
death
and
i
would
rather
drown
or
be
shot
than
die
little
by
little
of
hunger
and
weariness
white
bear
hugged
his
mother
again
i
know
we
will
meet
again
in
the
west
he
said
that
as
they
both
knew
could
mean
across
the
river
or
at
the
other
end
of
the
trail
of
souls
sun
woman
said
my
son
you
have
made
my
heart
glad
every
day
of
your
life
you
have
walked
your
path
with
courage
and
honor
may
you
walk
the
same
way
always
redbird
held
sun
woman
and
iron
knife
each
in
turn
for
a
long
time
and
after
they
had
gone
white
bear
and
redbird
went
together
into
the
thick
woods
along
the
edge
of
the
great
river
away
from
the
others
white
bear
became
aware
of
the
shrill
chirping
of
choirs
of
crickets
filling
the
night
air
mosquitoes
shrilled
around
his
ears
and
stung
his
hands
and
face
he
and
redbird
had
long
since
used
up
the
oil
that
kept
them
off
but
the
scratches
and
bruises
of
the
trail
of
hardship
they
had
walked
these
past
moons
had
toughened
their
skins
and
their
spirits
so
that
mosquito
stings
meant
little
white
bear
found
a
clear
spot
in
the
midst
of
a
stand
of
young
maples
and
they
lay
down
side
by
side
he
put
his
hand
on
her
breast
fuller
than
he
had
ever
felt
it
swollen
with
milk
for
floating
lily
she
slipped
her
dress
down
off
her
shoulders
and
let
him
touch
her
bare
flesh
very
gently
knowing
it
was
tender
from
nursing
he
caressed
her
nipple
with
his
fingertips
before
i
leave
tonight
i
will
give
you
the
dagger
my
father
gave
me
he
said
softly
i
must
go
unarmed
so
that
the
long
knives
will
not
kill
me
if
they
catch
me
keep
it
for
me
till
i
come
back
i
am
afraid
she
whispered
when
you
and
yellow
hair
and
woodrow
are
gone
black
hawk
will
know
you
helped
them
escape
what
will
he
do
to
you
when
you
come
back
by
the
time
i
return
to
you
he
will
not
be
angry
he
will
realize
he
did
not
really
need
them
and
then
too
white
bear
might
be
captured
or
killed
the
last
time
he
had
gone
to
the
long
knives
they
had
nearly
killed
him
the
sight
of
little
crow
head
bursting
blood
flying
everywhere
as
armand
perrault
bullet
smashed
it
would
never
leave
his
memory
if
that
happened
to
him
black
hawk
anger
would
not
matter
redbird
wriggled
closer
to
him
her
hand
stroking
his
chest
as
his
stroked
hers
i
do
not
think
any
sauk
warrior
would
be
willing
to
steal
prisoners
away
from
his
chief
i
think
you
do
this
because
you
have
lived
so
long
with
pale
eyes
white
bear
felt
desire
for
her
swelling
in
him
they
had
coupled
twice
only
since
floating
lily
was
born
he
pulled
her
skirt
up
so
he
could
stroke
her
belly
and
the
smooth
insides
of
her
thighs
from
what
i
saw
among
the
pale
eyes
he
said
knowing
a
bitterness
even
as
he
sought
the
joy
of
redbird
they
are
more
obedient
to
their
chiefs
than
we
are
and
though
it
makes
our
hearts
weep
if
our
people
are
not
to
disappear
we
must
learn
to
obey
our
leaders
as
the
pale
eyes
do
but
this
night
i
must
disobey
our
war
chief
we
must
change
said
redbird
but
if
we
become
like
the
pale
eyes
it
will
be
the
same
as
disappearing
then
she
whispered
oh
as
his
touch
in
a
warm
moist
place
pleased
her
she
loosened
his
loincloth
and
his
breathing
quickened
as
her
fingertips
played
awhile
with
him
then
she
grasped
his
hard
flesh
firmly
he
sighed
as
he
felt
her
fingers
squeezing
him
he
should
save
his
strength
he
thought
because
he
would
be
awake
and
traveling
all
night
and
probably
all
day
tomorrow
with
nancy
and
woodrow
but
he
and
redbird
might
never
be
together
like
this
again
he
rolled
over
on
top
of
her
and
let
her
small
gentle
hand
guide
him
into
her
as
he
groaned
aloud
with
the
pleasure
of
it
a
tiny
sliver
of
a
new
moon
had
risen
just
above
the
hills
on
this
side
of
the
river
white
bear
nancy
and
woodrow
made
their
way
south
of
the
band
camp
to
a
meadow
in
a
hollow
between
hills
here
the
band
had
turned
out
their
few
remaining
horses
to
graze
and
sleep
from
the
north
end
of
the
camp
beside
the
bad
axe
river
came
the
sound
of
men
voices
and
the
light
of
fires
men
were
stripping
the
bark
from
elm
trees
to
make
simple
canoes
and
tying
driftwood
logs
together
to
make
rafts
white
bear
nancy
and
woodrow
worked
their
way
around
the
edge
of
the
meadow
the
horses
were
dark
shapes
standing
quietly
white
bear
could
hear
nancy
stifle
a
sob
every
now
and
then
she
had
been
crying
all
evening
he
wanted
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
hold
her
close
and
tell
her
she
did
not
have
to
leave
him
he
was
the
cause
of
her
pain
and
could
do
nothing
about
it
he
could
possibly
save
her
life
but
he
could
not
make
her
happy
a
tall
shadow
suddenly
stood
in
his
path
i
have
three
horses
ready
for
you
said
iron
knife
i
even
found
saddles
to
make
it
easier
for
you
to
ride
they
belonged
to
men
who
died
at
the
ouisconsin
river
battle
white
bear
had
been
carrying
the
rifle
and
powder
horn
frank
had
given
him
he
thrust
them
at
iron
knife
i
want
you
to
have
this
rifle
a
pale
eyes
uncle
of
mine
a
good
uncle
gave
it
to
me
if
i
meet
the
long
knives
now
a
rifle
will
not
help
me
iron
knife
took
the
rifle
and
slung
the
horn
over
his
shoulder
may
the
spirit
of
the
great
river
watch
over
you
his
heart
aching
white
bear
opened
his
mouth
wanting
to
tell
iron
knife
again
to
go
with
black
hawk
not
to
stay
here
at
the
mouth
of
the
bad
axe
but
he
knew
iron
knife
mind
was
made
up
redbird
brother
was
strong
not
only
in
body
but
in
doing
what
he
had
decided
instead
of
speaking
white
bear
reached
up
and
grasped
iron
broad
shoulders
and
squeezed
hard
white
bear
nancy
and
woodrow
led
their
horses
quietly
along
the
riverbank
finding
places
where
the
shrubbery
was
thin
enough
to
allow
passage
white
bear
kept
glancing
over
his
shoulder
and
when
he
could
no
longer
see
the
band
fires
to
the
north
he
whispered
to
nancy
and
woodrow
to
mount
he
let
his
horse
find
its
own
path
beside
the
rippling
water
many
times
as
they
rode
southward
he
caught
himself
dozing
off
fatigued
not
only
by
exertion
and
lack
of
sleep
but
by
hunger
he
watched
the
moon
slide
across
the
sky
over
the
river
as
it
sank
in
the
west
he
called
a
halt
and
told
nancy
and
woodrow
they
could
rest
till
sunup
they
tied
their
horses
to
saplings
and
crawled
in
under
the
boughs
of
a
big
spruce
tree
woodrow
fell
asleep
at
once
but
nancy
crept
into
white
bear
arms
by
her
movements
she
told
him
that
she
wanted
him
forgive
me
he
said
i
am
so
tired
she
stroked
his
cheek
reassuringly
but
her
face
against
his
was
she
fell
asleep
with
her
head
on
his
chest
daylight
and
a
loud
chorus
of
birdsong
woke
them
soon
after
they
started
riding
they
passed
through
an
empty
village
of
lodges
winnebago
he
was
sure
beside
the
river
winnebago
friends
of
black
hawk
had
said
that
the
long
knives
had
ordered
all
winnebago
to
camp
within
sight
of
the
forts
to
show
that
they
were
not
helping
black
hawk
a
clear
trail
led
south
from
the
village
along
the
riverbank
and
white
bear
nancy
and
woodrow
rode
along
it
by
the
end
of
the
day
they
should
be
near
the
settlement
of
prairie
du
chien
and
the
long
knives
fort
crawford
when
the
sun
was
high
over
the
river
white
bear
heard
a
sound
that
sent
fear
rustling
down
his
back
the
shouts
of
long
knife
leaders
calling
orders
the
cries
came
from
somewhere
to
the
south
with
horror
he
saw
it
at
once
in
his
mind
one
long
knife
army
coming
from
the
east
now
another
marching
up
from
the
south
both
heading
for
the
mouth
of
the
bad
axe
where
the
people
were
trying
desperately
to
get
across
the
river
a
little
later
he
heard
the
rumble
of
many
hooves
he
wanted
to
turn
and
gallop
back
to
warn
the
band
they
had
no
notion
that
this
second
army
much
closer
to
them
was
coming
nancy
said
you
better
leave
us
here
they
shoot
at
you
fear
for
himself
and
for
his
people
tempted
him
to
agree
but
he
firmly
shook
his
head
i
must
stay
with
you
until
i
sure
you
safe
it
is
a
matter
only
of
minutes
soon
white
bear
glimpsed
the
stars
and
stripes
fluttering
among
distant
trees
and
the
noon
sun
glittering
on
brass
buttons
federal
troops
at
a
clear
spot
on
the
trail
where
nancy
and
woodrow
would
be
visible
from
a
distance
he
called
a
halt
you
two
stay
on
the
trail
nancy
pull
your
braids
around
to
the
front
so
they
can
see
your
blond
hair
woodrow
take
that
headband
off
you
want
to
make
sure
they
see
that
you
white
just
hold
your
horses
still
and
when
you
see
the
first
soldiers
raise
your
hands
above
your
heads
and
call
out
to
them
in
english
earthmaker
keep
them
this
was
the
best
he
could
do
for
them
nancy
kissed
him
hard
on
the
mouth
i
love
you
so
much
she
said
her
voice
breaking
and
i
know
never
see
you
again
go
on
get
away
from
here
white
bear
led
his
horse
back
into
the
woods
between
the
river
and
the
bluffs
he
tied
the
horse
and
then
crept
back
through
the
shrubbery
to
watch
nancy
and
woodrow
terrified
by
the
thought
that
he
might
see
them
shot
down
before
his
eyes
by
careless
soldiers
he
held
his
breath
he
heard
hoofbeats
approaching
at
the
gallop
he
heard
nancy
cry
help
us
please
we
white
people
two
men
wearing
tall
cylindrical
black
shakoes
and
blue
jackets
with
white
crossbelts
rode
up
to
nancy
and
woodrow
who
lowered
their
hands
after
a
brief
conversation
all
four
rode
off
down
the
trail
in
a
burst
of
relief
white
bear
let
his
breath
out
for
a
moment
he
could
not
move
so
limp
had
his
fear
for
nancy
and
woodrow
left
him
he
whispered
a
prayer
of
thanks
to
earthmaker
he
crept
back
to
his
horse
and
walked
it
till
he
found
a
deer
track
the
horse
could
follow
then
mounted
and
trotted
northward
he
was
back
riding
on
the
trail
when
an
arrow
thrumming
buried
its
head
in
the
dirt
just
in
front
of
him
it
startled
him
so
that
he
nearly
fell
out
of
the
saddle
he
reined
in
his
horse
men
on
horseback
emerged
from
the
trees
ahead
of
him
they
rode
toward
him
silently
five
of
them
two
pointed
rifles
at
him
the
other
three
bows
and
arrows
they
were
red
men
but
wore
pale
eyes
shirts
and
trousers
their
hair
was
long
bound
by
brightly
colored
sashcloth
bands
and
they
grew
it
full
not
shaving
part
of
their
heads
as
most
sauk
men
did
he
sighed
and
held
his
hands
out
from
his
sides
to
show
that
they
were
empty
the
winnebago
could
have
shot
him
off
his
horse
without
warning
so
he
supposed
they
meant
to
let
him
live
the
man
on
the
right
side
of
the
trail
who
held
a
bow
with
an
arrow
aimed
at
white
bear
heart
said
in
sauk
i
am
called
wave
we
are
looking
for
black
hawk
where
can
we
find
him
white
bear
decided
to
make
a
joke
of
that
do
you
want
to
help
him
fight
the
long
knives
wave
laughed
and
translated
it
for
his
companions
who
laughed
also
he
wore
a
brave
red
and
white
feathers
dangling
from
earrings
with
two
more
standing
upright
in
his
hair
he
said
the
long
knives
have
offered
horses
and
gold
to
whoever
captures
black
hawk
we
are
not
enemies
of
the
sauk
but
we
want
the
long
knives
friendship
the
man
spoke
sauk
fluently
and
without
an
accent
it
is
a
shame
that
the
winnebago
fight
on
the
side
of
the
long
knives
white
bear
said
one
day
they
will
take
your
land
from
you
as
they
have
taken
ours
from
us
wave
shrugged
look
what
has
happened
to
you
who
fought
against
them
man
betrays
red
man
and
only
the
whites
gain
it
is
as
i
told
redbird
if
we
want
to
live
in
this
land
we
ourselves
must
become
like
the
come
said
wave
we
must
take
you
to
the
long
knives
war
chief
white
bear
slumped
in
despair
realizing
that
he
was
no
longer
a
free
man
he
looked
about
him
the
trees
the
birds
the
great
river
they
were
all
free
but
he
was
in
the
power
of
his
enemies
the
world
was
a
darker
place
black
hawk
war
for
him
was
over
he
wished
he
could
have
warned
his
people
about
the
approaching
army
of
long
knives
and
also
his
heart
ached
for
the
sauk
he
was
unable
to
warn
of
the
second
long
knife
army
a
yearning
for
redbird
and
eagle
feather
and
floating
lily
seemed
almost
to
pull
his
heart
from
his
body
he
prayed
that
they
had
safely
left
the
bad
axe
country
by
now
and
headed
north
with
black
hawk
probably
he
would
never
see
them
again
probably
the
long
knives
would
kill
him
with
a
sigh
he
turned
his
horse
head
in
the
direction
wave
had
pointed
while
his
regiment
rode
by
the
long
knife
war
chief
a
stocky
man
with
a
long
face
thick
eyebrows
and
hard
blue
eyes
stood
by
the
side
of
the
trail
facing
white
bear
he
was
colonel
zachary
taylor
he
had
told
white
bear
a
burly
soldier
with
a
sergeant
three
chevrons
on
his
forearm
stood
beside
taylor
staring
at
white
bear
with
open
hatred
what
are
you
a
renegade
white
man
taylor
demanded
how
come
you
speak
good
english
i
am
sauk
colonel
my
name
is
white
bear
my
father
was
white
and
he
took
me
to
be
educated
among
the
whites
for
several
years
well
white
bear
what
were
you
doing
on
this
trail
chasing
the
white
woman
and
the
boy
we
just
picked
up
it
was
i
who
brought
them
to
you
taylor
snorted
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
miss
hale
will
tell
you
it
is
true
well
we
already
sent
her
and
the
boy
back
to
fort
crawford
with
an
escort
so
that
will
have
to
wait
but
you
do
have
her
name
right
where
are
the
rest
of
the
sauk
trying
to
cross
the
mississippi
i
can
not
help
you
colonel
any
more
than
you
would
give
information
to
the
sauk
if
we
captured
you
taylor
sergeant
said
sir
let
me
and
a
couple
of
my
men
take
this
for
a
stroll
in
the
woods
we
find
out
what
you
want
to
know
no
benson
no
taylor
brushed
the
suggestion
aside
with
an
irritated
wave
of
his
hand
showing
how
they
can
resist
torture
is
a
regular
game
with
indians
he
just
sing
indian
songs
till
he
dies
and
listening
to
that
would
be
worse
agony
for
you
than
anything
you
could
do
to
him
well
then
let
shoot
the
bastard
sir
and
be
done
with
him
the
militia
do
take
no
prisoners
why
should
we
taylor
threw
back
his
head
and
even
though
he
was
shorter
than
the
sergeant
managed
to
look
down
his
nose
at
him
we
professional
soldiers
sergeant
i
trust
we
know
how
to
conduct
ourselves
better
than
the
state
militia
no
we
just
take
him
along
with
us
an
indian
who
speaks
both
sauk
and
english
could
be
of
use
to
us
alive
i
see
you
have
a
full
head
of
hair
and
you
wear
no
feathers
white
bear
that
mean
you
have
killed
anybody
or
just
that
you
do
want
the
fact
known
i
have
killed
anybody
white
bear
thought
of
adding
that
he
had
saved
more
than
one
white
life
but
he
could
expect
them
to
believe
that
he
would
not
expose
himself
to
their
scorn
he
said
i
am
a
medicine
man
a
shaman
taylor
looked
at
him
gravely
educated
as
a
white
man
and
educated
in
the
way
of
the
spirits
too
eh
and
with
all
that
learning
you
warn
black
hawk
away
from
this
disaster
white
bear
shook
his
head
he
listened
to
other
voices
taylor
eyes
narrowed
well
whatever
advice
you
gave
him
it
all
over
for
your
chief
now
god
pity
your
people
white
bear
said
all
they
want
now
is
to
go
back
across
the
mississippi
and
live
in
peace
those
who
are
left
taylor
fixed
him
with
an
angry
stare
it
too
late
for
that
things
have
gone
too
far
you
people
are
going
to
have
to
suffer
for
what
you
done
white
bear
felt
his
limbs
go
cold
as
he
heard
the
steel
in
voice
this
was
not
a
bad
man
white
bear
sensed
not
a
man
like
raoul
but
whatever
mercy
was
in
him
had
no
doubt
long
since
been
washed
away
by
the
blood
shed
by
black
hawk
war
parties
doubt
while
he
talks
about
making
my
people
suffer
he
thinks
of
himself
as
quite
a
civilized
revenge
colonel
white
bear
said
i
thought
you
were
professional
soldiers
the
sergeant
balled
his
fists
please
sir
let
me
teach
him
some
respect
taylor
cocked
his
head
listening
to
a
distant
sound
then
turned
to
look
downriver
he
got
a
much
more
bitter
lesson
to
learn
sergeant
as
do
all
his
people
white
bear
heard
it
too
a
chugging
sound
it
had
been
a
while
since
he
had
heard
a
noise
like
that
he
followed
taylor
gaze
down
the
river
all
he
could
see
was
a
column
of
gray
smoke
in
the
sky
to
the
south
but
he
knew
what
it
was
a
steamship
because
he
could
not
ride
to
warn
his
people
he
wanted
to
cry
out
in
agony
he
saw
what
would
happen
those
few
frail
canoes
the
steamship
bearing
down
on
them
two
long
knife
armies
marching
inexorably
toward
the
mouth
of
the
bad
axe
many
who
follow
black
hawk
across
the
great
river
will
be
few
when
they
cross
river
of
blood
raoul
uncorked
the
jug
standing
on
the
chart
table
and
held
it
out
to
bill
helmer
captain
of
the
steamship
a
portly
man
with
muttonchop
whiskers
his
hands
firmly
gripping
the
polished
oak
steering
wheel
helmer
silently
shook
his
head
raoul
lifted
the
jug
in
a
mock
toast
may
we
have
a
merry
day
of
indian
fighting
he
took
two
long
swallows
and
decided
he
felt
strong
and
happy
helmer
shook
his
head
de
marion
there
nothing
merry
about
fighting
indians
if
that
your
opinion
captain
i
thank
you
to
keep
it
to
yourself
said
raoul
he
wanted
a
little
warmth
right
now
besides
what
he
was
getting
from
the
jug
and
he
despised
this
dour
man
for
not
giving
it
to
him
helmer
shrugged
and
bent
his
gaze
on
the
river
raoul
knotted
his
fingers
behind
his
back
and
found
that
the
effort
relieved
the
tightness
in
his
belly
he
went
to
stand
at
the
pilot
house
window
and
stared
out
at
the
forested
bank
where
the
bad
axe
river
emptied
into
the
mississippi
militiamen
were
wading
across
the
bad
axe
from
south
to
north
holding
their
rifles
bayonets
fixed
over
their
heads
the
bad
axe
was
more
a
creek
than
a
river
shallow
now
in
august
winding
through
a
channel
thick
with
bright
green
reeds
as
the
men
slogged
up
the
north
bank
they
leveled
their
rifles
and
plunged
into
the
trees
a
blue
haze
of
powder
smoke
already
drifted
amidst
the
pine
and
spruce
north
of
the
bad
axe
mouth
the
popping
of
rifles
carried
to
raoul
across
the
water
over
the
wheeze
and
clank
of
the
steam
engine
fueled
with
oak
and
split
pine
raoul
wondered
what
was
happening
in
those
woods
were
the
indians
fighting
back
defending
their
women
and
children
he
hoped
the
militiamen
would
go
on
killing
until
they
exterminated
the
whole
band
after
four
months
of
chasing
the
indians
across
illinois
and
the
michigan
territory
after
all
the
innocents
murdered
surely
the
militiamen
would
not
be
soft
he
felt
tears
starting
up
and
he
quickly
took
another
pull
at
the
jug
he
wished
he
could
be
in
at
the
kill
instead
of
out
here
in
the
river
want
their
blood
on
my
own
lieutenant
kingsbury
in
command
of
the
gunnery
crew
assigned
to
raoul
from
fort
crawford
came
up
the
stairs
from
the
foredeck
to
the
hurricane
deck
and
entered
the
pilot
house
he
mopped
his
brow
as
he
set
his
cylindrical
shako
sporting
its
red
plume
and
gold
artillery
badge
on
the
chart
table
gets
damned
sticky
on
the
river
in
august
raoul
offered
his
jug
help
you
forget
the
heat
kingsbury
grinned
thanked
raoul
and
took
a
big
drink
his
cheeks
reddened
and
he
dabbed
at
his
thick
brown
mustache
with
his
fingertips
i
do
hear
much
shooting
on
shore
he
said
handing
the
jug
back
to
raoul
who
took
a
swallow
before
setting
it
down
just
what
i
was
thinking
said
raoul
where
the
hell
are
all
the
redskins
i
figure
there
about
a
thousand
left
they
ca
all
have
crossed
the
mississippi
before
we
got
here
unless
they
had
a
whole
fleet
of
canoes
the
had
caught
one
canoe
in
midstream
when
she
arrived
on
the
scene
raoul
militia
sharpshooters
had
blanketed
it
with
rifle
fire
killing
all
six
indians
aboard
and
the
overturned
canoe
had
drifted
downstream
out
of
sight
raoul
picked
up
a
brass
telescope
from
the
chart
table
and
studied
the
riverbank
moving
the
circular
field
from
point
to
point
he
saw
plenty
of
militiamen
but
no
sign
of
indians
look
said
kingsbury
militiamen
coming
back
out
of
the
woods
raoul
swept
his
telescope
back
over
the
riverbank
men
in
buckskins
were
dragging
their
rifle
butts
along
the
ground
sitting
down
on
the
edge
and
splashing
water
on
their
faces
shaking
their
heads
angrily
raccoon
tails
on
their
caps
wagging
one
man
did
emerge
from
the
trees
with
a
big
grin
holding
high
three
bloody
scalps
dangling
from
hanks
of
black
hair
another
man
led
two
indian
ponies
so
the
sauk
still
had
a
few
horses
with
them
kingsbury
said
looks
like
they
only
met
a
handful
raoul
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
polished
oak
sill
a
rear
guard
the
rest
could
have
headed
north
but
i
do
think
they
did
they
were
aiming
to
cross
the
mississippi
his
telescope
brought
closer
an
island
north
of
the
bad
axe
mouth
about
fifty
yards
out
from
the
mississippi
east
bank
thickly
covered
with
spruce
and
hemlock
he
saw
two
bark
canoes
with
bottoms
beached
at
the
island
southern
tip
between
the
island
and
the
riverbank
the
water
had
a
pale
green
look
that
said
it
was
shallow
i
got
a
feeling
most
of
the
indians
are
hiding
out
on
that
island
his
pulse
quickened
and
his
breath
came
fast
his
first
thought
was
to
land
on
the
island
with
his
men
and
flush
the
indians
out
but
there
could
still
be
a
couple
of
hundred
warriors
left
to
the
band
no
they
have
to
use
the
first
captain
bill
sail
along
the
west
side
of
that
island
i
want
to
get
a
closer
look
at
it
the
spokes
flew
under
helmer
hands
and
the
side
paddles
churned
up
the
water
raoul
followed
by
kingsbury
hurried
down
the
stairs
to
the
foredeck
where
his
own
dozen
militiamen
all
smith
county
boys
who
had
reenlisted
watched
him
stride
the
planks
to
stand
beside
the
it
had
saved
the
townspeople
at
victor
now
mounted
on
the
foredeck
it
would
finish
the
sauk
the
late
morning
sun
beat
without
mercy
on
the
open
deck
and
sweat
trickled
down
from
raoul
armpits
he
wanted
to
throw
his
jacket
off
and
wear
just
a
shirt
but
the
military
blue
the
gold
braid
and
the
brass
buttons
gave
him
authority
that
he
found
he
needed
not
so
much
in
dealing
with
his
own
men
as
with
other
officers
hodge
hode
said
we
got
treed
now
colonel
but
stay
under
cover
said
raoul
these
raccoons
will
be
shooting
back
his
eyes
tried
to
tear
holes
in
the
thick
greenery
on
the
island
the
smith
county
boys
crouched
down
behind
the
bales
of
hay
lined
along
the
railings
and
cocked
their
flintlocks
raoul
patted
the
gun
black
muzzle
affectionately
and
the
three
artillerists
in
blue
jackets
grinned
and
nodded
at
him
they
had
put
their
shakoes
aside
and
wrapped
rags
around
their
heads
to
keep
the
sweat
out
of
their
eyes
beside
the
cannon
were
stacked
canisters
of
grapeshot
and
flannel
bags
of
powder
in
a
few
minutes
raoul
thought
with
pleasure
that
grape
would
be
sending
a
heap
of
red
devils
to
hell
as
the
steamed
around
the
tip
of
the
island
raoul
searched
the
forest
with
his
telescope
he
guessed
the
island
to
be
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
it
was
deeply
forested
enough
to
conceal
hundreds
of
indians
midway
along
he
saw
a
gleam
of
sun
on
brown
skin
in
the
shrubbery
near
the
river
edge
he
swung
the
telescope
back
to
the
spot
nothing
now
but
the
quarry
was
there
all
right
his
lips
drew
back
from
his
teeth
captain
bill
he
called
to
the
pilot
house
turn
our
bow
toward
the
island
kingsbury
get
ready
to
fire
kingsbury
saluted
and
called
orders
to
the
gun
crew
a
gunner
slid
a
bag
of
powder
into
the
muzzle
and
rammed
it
home
another
pushed
a
canister
of
grapeshot
in
after
it
the
third
held
the
burning
linstock
ready
raoul
called
to
the
bridge
captain
hold
her
position
the
captain
waved
acknowledgment
from
behind
the
glass
and
raoul
heard
him
ring
a
bell
relaying
his
orders
belowdecks
a
moment
later
levers
clanked
and
raoul
felt
the
deck
tremble
as
the
paddle
wheels
on
the
sides
of
the
ship
reversed
themselves
shoot
when
you
ready
lieutenant
raoul
said
how
i
love
this
kingsbury
shouted
fire
the
gun
thundered
deafening
him
and
leaped
back
in
its
cradle
of
tackle
raoul
watched
the
woods
eagerly
as
a
white
smoke
cloud
spread
over
the
water
on
the
island
branches
flew
in
all
directions
a
big
tree
fell
he
heard
a
scream
followed
by
a
series
of
wailing
cries
he
almost
cried
aloud
with
pleasure
an
indian
staggered
out
from
behind
the
trunk
of
a
tall
pine
he
dragged
one
leg
a
useless
mass
of
bloody
meat
and
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
he
held
a
rifle
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
then
aimed
the
rifle
from
his
prone
position
in
sudden
fear
raoul
was
about
to
duck
behind
a
hay
bale
when
a
dozen
shots
cracked
out
from
the
railings
beside
him
bleeding
from
his
chest
and
his
head
the
indian
collapsed
and
rolled
into
the
mississippi
nodding
happily
raoul
watched
the
current
catch
his
body
it
drifted
slowly
downstream
trailing
blood
keep
firing
raoul
roared
a
cannoneer
swabbed
inside
the
gun
barrel
to
cool
it
down
for
more
powder
in
a
moment
the
gun
boomed
out
again
more
trees
splintered
but
no
more
indians
were
flushed
out
raise
elevation
ten
degrees
kingsbury
called
to
the
gunners
probably
lurking
farther
back
in
the
woods
raoul
heard
the
clicks
as
the
gunners
used
hand
spikes
to
raise
the
cannon
in
its
carriage
after
the
cannon
went
off
dirt
and
broken
tree
limbs
sprayed
out
of
the
forest
and
raoul
heard
shrieking
sounds
that
he
hoped
were
the
screams
of
indians
the
cannon
boomed
again
and
again
with
hand
signals
to
captain
bill
in
the
pilot
house
raoul
had
the
bow
swung
to
starboard
and
then
to
port
so
that
the
grapeshot
struck
the
island
in
a
wide
arc
trees
slowly
toppled
over
and
shrieks
of
pain
and
shouts
of
rage
and
defiance
pierced
the
silence
between
the
roars
of
the
cannon
he
pictured
the
lead
balls
tearing
into
howling
indians
ripping
their
flesh
apart
he
remembered
helene
body
in
lake
michigan
he
remembered
black
salmon
lash
on
his
back
he
saw
as
he
had
seen
them
two
weeks
ago
the
heap
of
blackened
split
logs
that
had
been
victoire
his
home
the
place
where
clarissa
phil
and
andy
died
he
saw
the
mound
of
earth
in
the
family
cemetery
where
they
lay
together
what
little
had
been
left
of
them
the
cannon
heat
was
his
rage
the
cannon
boom
was
his
roar
the
grapeshot
was
his
vengeance
he
hurled
his
hatred
over
the
water
and
into
the
trees
blowing
indian
bodies
to
shreds
he
heard
something
hum
past
his
head
and
plunk
into
the
pilot
house
behind
him
he
saw
smoke
puff
from
the
shadowy
base
of
a
clump
of
spruces
another
puff
and
another
the
reports
of
rifles
carried
across
the
water
sir
kingsbury
hand
gripped
his
shoulder
the
fingers
digging
in
raoul
realized
he
had
been
momentarily
out
of
his
mind
with
fury
breathing
heavily
he
got
his
eyes
focused
on
the
lieutenant
get
down
sir
before
you
get
hit
reluctantly
because
he
wanted
to
see
where
the
grapeshot
was
hitting
raoul
crouched
down
behind
a
hay
bale
when
he
first
come
out
on
deck
he
been
afraid
of
being
shot
at
now
he
felt
sure
they
could
hit
him
the
repeatedly
tore
into
the
area
on
shore
where
powder
smoke
had
appeared
raoul
saw
no
sign
of
indian
bodies
but
the
firing
from
the
trees
stopped
gawd
i
hate
to
be
on
the
angry
side
of
this
gun
said
levi
pope
a
dozen
or
more
indians
burst
from
the
trees
and
dove
into
the
water
some
of
them
started
swimming
out
toward
the
others
turned
south
following
the
current
some
just
splashed
helplessly
shoot
raoul
shouted
gleefully
he
ran
into
the
pilot
house
and
grabbed
his
hall
rifle
he
rushed
back
to
stand
by
the
rail
he
took
aim
at
the
nearest
indian
in
the
water
he
heard
his
breath
coming
heavy
as
it
did
when
he
was
in
bed
with
a
woman
only
the
warrior
shaven
head
scalplock
flowing
behind
was
far
enough
out
of
the
water
to
present
a
clear
target
the
indian
seemed
to
be
trying
to
swim
past
the
toward
the
distant
shore
opposite
raoul
took
his
time
aiming
at
the
shiny
brown
dome
and
pulled
the
trigger
he
saw
a
splash
of
red
then
the
indian
arms
and
legs
stopped
moving
and
the
body
drifted
southward
with
the
current
pushing
bullets
down
the
tight
rifled
bores
of
their
with
practiced
speed
raoul
men
could
easily
get
off
three
shots
or
more
in
a
minute
the
sky
blue
of
the
river
soon
turned
red
with
blood
from
bodies
that
floated
swiftly
away

the

not

said
armand
perrault
there
is
no
place
for
them
to
swim
to
it
was
true
the
opposite
shore
of
the
mississippi
was
too
far
away
and
this
shore
was
lined
with
federal
troops
and
state
militia
who
would
shoot
any
swimming
redskin
they
saw
the
indians
must
have
known
they
were
doomed
but
still
they
came
on
little
groups
jumping
into
the
water
each
one
probably
hoping
to
be
lucky
enough
to
escape
alive
most
of
the
heads
raoul
saw
in
the
water
streamed
black
hair
must
be
women
and
children
not
scalplocked
warriors
but
it
did
really
matter
what
they
were
killed
my

and
my
he
saw
a
head
trailing
long
black
hair
and
blood
in
the
water
not
ten
feet
off
the
starboard
bow
close
enough
to
see
it
was
a
boy
he
was
trying
desperately
to
swim
with
one
arm
his
face
distorted
with
agony
raoul
aimed
his
rifle
between
the
wide
terrified
eyes
that
stared
into
his
own
he
pulled
the
trigger
the
brown
face
sank
below
the
water
for
phil
and
groups
of
indians
threw
themselves
into
the
river
from
the
distant
parts
of
the
island
but
the
steamboat
turned
quickly
upstream
and
downstream
back
and
forth
again
and
again
to
pursue
them
raoul
sharpshooters
wiping
out
each
party
of
swimmers
in
turn
captain
bill
might
not
enjoy
this
work
but
he
did
it
well
raoul
heard
himself
laughing
under
his
breath
as
he
thought
of
all
the
indians
who
were
dying
before
his
eyes
because
of
ship
and
cannon
and
riflemen
then
the
resumed
steaming
slowly
along
the
length
of

at
intervals
for

of
grapeshot
blanketed
the
island
from
side
to
side
finally
raoul
decided
that
they
had
done
all
they
could
from
the
ship
all
that
blood
in
the
water
made
a
fine
sight
made
him
yearn
all
the
more
to
wet
his
hands
with
blood
climbing
back
up
to
the
pilot
house
he
said
take
her
to
the
south
end
of
the
island
captain
bill
as
close
as
you
can
we
going
to
land
helmer
stared
at
him
but
said
nothing
he
better
say
nothing
raoul
took
his
pistol
out
of
its
holster
and
checked
to
see
that
it
was
primed
and
loaded
he
unsheathed
his
replica
of
bowie
knife
he
hefted
it
heavy
as
a
meat
cleaver
in
his
hand
and
tested
the
edge
with
his
thumb
it
would
cut
by
god
it
would
cut
he
slid
it
back
into
its
sheath
he
opened
his
mouth
gulping
air
in
his
excitement
his
hands
tingled
and
his
whole
body
felt
as
if
it
were
growing
bigger
he
wanted
to
kill
indians
he
wanted
to
wade
in
their
blood
maybe
find
black
hawk
himself
and
take
his
scalp
with
the
big
bowie
knife
he
hoped
there
would
be
hundreds
of
redskins
still
alive
cowering
on
that
island
he
needed
to
kill
them
by
the
hundreds
the
ship
progress
down
the
length
of
the
island
seemed
to
take
forever
he
tried
to
calm
himself
after
that
bombardment
with
grapeshot
after
so
many
indians
had
been
shot
trying
to
swim
away
there
probably
would
be
many
left
alive
on
the
island
it
would
really
be
a
fight
they
be
close
to
helpless
after
we
ashore
he
said
to
helmer
take
the
ship
over
to
the
troops
on
the
mississippi
bank
and
tell
general
atkinson
we
found
the
main
body
of
the
sauk
tell
him
to
send
as
many
men
as
the
will
carry
the
steamboat
shallow
draft
allowed
her
to
move
in
close
so
raoul
and
his
dozen
smith
county
boys
could
jump
down
into
water
holding
rifles
bayonets
screwed
in
place
and
pistols
and
cases
of
cartridges
and
shot
over
their
heads
the
water
was
cold
and
clammy
through
raoul
flannel
trousers
and
his
feet
squelched
in
his
boots
the
drew
away
with
a
thumping
of
her
engine
and
puffs
of
thick
black
smoke
from
her
two
smokestacks
just
the
sight
of
that
steamship
should
have
been
enough
to
scare
hell
out
of
the
indians
raoul
thought
he
and
his
men
clambered
up
sloping
rocks
to
stand
in
a
clear
area
of
level
ground
just
where
the
woods
started
the
upper
half
of
an
indian
lay
on
his
back
trailing
long
bloody
ribbons
of
gut
the
eyes
were
open
staring
that
what
i
wanted
to
remember
that
we
take
no
prisoners
he
said
hodge
hode
said
well
come
on
let
knock
them
out
of
the
trees
an
arrow
punched
through
hodge
neck
from
front
to
back
raoul
heart
stopped
then
thumped
so
hard
with
fear
that
he
thought
it
might
split
his
chest
open
hodge
dropped
his
rifle
and
fell
to
the
ground
gagging
raoul
went
down
on
his
knees
beside
hodge
seized
the
arrow
just
under
its
flint
head
and
pulled
it
through
as
the
feathered
end
went
through
his
neck
hodge
made
a
retching
sound
his
tongue
stuck
out
of
his
mouth
raoul
cursed
under
his
breath
as
he
bent
over
hodge
this
could
be
happening
more
arrows
were
flying
past
them
raoul
men
fired
a
ragged
volley
into
the
woods
and
the
arrows
stopped
the
arrow
had
cut
through
an
artery
and
pierced
hodge
windpipe
his
breath
whistled
in
and
out
through
the
hole
in
his
throat
his
blood
pumping
out
of
him
and
soaking
into
his
red
beard
he
is
going
said
armand
kneeling
beside
raoul
aw
no
hodge
managed
to
murmur
raoul
felt
sick
as
he
watched
blood
fill
hodge
mouth
and
pour
out
of
it
then
the
big
man
went
limp
and
his
eyes
rolled
up
in
his
head
let
get
the
bastards
raoul
growled
he
was
left
scared
as
hell
by
hodge
death
but
he
was
damned
if
he
show
it
they
climbed
over
big
branches
knocked
down
by
the
cannon
and
ran
in
among
the
trees
raoul
taking
the
lead
spruce
branches
whipped
his
face
must
be
crazy
charging
into
the
woods
like
this
we
could
all
get
what
hodge
war
whoops
shrilled
out
of
the
forest
shadows
ahead
and
more
arrows
whistled
at
them
knowing
it
was
only
luck
that
none
of
them
hit
him
raoul
wanted
desperately
to
fire
his
rifle
into
the
forest
but
he
forced
himself
not
to
shoot
until
he
could
see
a
target
brown
figures
rushed
toward
him
darting
from
tree
to
tree
he
fired
at
a
warrior
leaping
between
the
thick
trunks
of
two
pines
the
indian
disappeared
but
raoul
was
sure
he
missed
he
jerked
the
breech
of
his
rifle
open
and
slapped
in
another
cartridge
with
frantic
speed
the
same
indian
reappeared
from
behind
another
tree
only
six
feet
away
raoul
brought
the
rifle
up
and
fired
the
indian
fell
over
backward
another
brave
leaped
at
him
from
the
side
swinging
a
tomahawk
raoul
shifted
his
rifle
to
his
left
hand
and
pulled
out
his
bowie
knife
the
indian
eyes
were
huge
and
white
and
wild
his
upraised
arms
left
his
chest
wide
open
ribs
showing
so
sharp
you
could
count
them
raoul
lunged
thrusting
the
knife
the
indian
rush
drove
him
onto
the
blade
his
tomahawk
came
down
on
raoul
forearm
it
hurt
but
it
did
even
hit
hard
enough
to
cut
through
raoul
sleeve
raoul
planted
his
foot
in
the
indian
belly
and
jerked
the
knife
out
of
his
body
as
the
warrior
collapsed
raoul
noticed
that
his
face
was
bare
brown
skin
devoid
of
paint
they
even
run
out
of
war
paint
he
thought
in
the
middle
of
this
battle
that
gave
him
a
moment
of
pleasure
rifles
were
going
off
on
both
sides
of
him
levi
pope
fired
into
the
upper
branches
of
an
elm
tree
and
whooped
as
a
warrior
body
came
crashing
down
the
air
was
full
of
blinding
bitter
smoke
then
silence
motionless
indians
lay
on
the
forest
floor
but
so
did
two
more
of
raoul
own
men
one
lay
face
down
perfectly
still
the
other
was
on
his
back
head
propped
against
a
tree
trunk
an
arrow
feathers
black
and
white
stuck
out
of
his
chest
his
eyes
were
open
but
saw
nothing
his
arms
and
empty
hands
jerked
the
movements
less
like
a
human
being
than
like
a
dying
insect
raoul
felt
bile
rising
in
his
throat
and
bit
his
lips
hard
to
stop
himself
from
puking
could
just
as
easily
have
been
another
man
had
an
arrow
in
his
arm
armand
pulled
it
out
of
him
with
a
mighty
jerk
the
man
screamed
and
armand
clapped
a
big
hand
over
his
mouth
raoul
nine
remaining
men
looked
from
the
two
dead
men
the
second
man
arms
had
stopped
jerking
to
raoul
were
they
just
waiting
for
orders
or
were
they
accusing
him
injuns
gettin
ready
for
another
charge
levi
pope
said
i
can
see
them
skulkin
out
there
pull
back
raoul
ordered
pick
up
those
dead
men
rifles
his
voice
rang
out
strangely
in
the
still
forest
reloading
and
walking
backward
rifles
pointed
up
raoul
and
his
men
retreated
to
the
tip
of
the
island
armand
carried
the
extra
rifles
they
piled
up
fallen
trees
to
make
a
hasty
barricade
raoul
lay
behind
tree
trunks
long
enough
for
the
sweat
to
cool
on
his
body
mosquitoes
and
little
black
flies
stung
him
incessantly
he
wondered
if
the
indians
would
ever
attack
he
gotten
himself
into
a
very
bad
spot
rifles
went
off
and
bullets
plunked
into
the
tree
barricade
brown
bodies
came
leaping
out
of
the
forest
raoul
suddenly
remembered
how
the
indians
had
rushed
out
from
behind
the
lake
michigan
dunes
twenty
years
ago
and
for
a
moment
he
was
a
terrified
little
boy
his
hands
shook
so
violently
he
almost
dropped
his
rifle
with
shrill
yips
and
yells
indians
came
at
them
arrows
and
bullets
whizzed
over
the
heads
of
raoul
men
as
they
ducked
down
behind
their
shelter
raoul
forced
himself
to
concentrate
on
shooting
he
poked
his
rifle
through
an
opening
between
broken
tree
limbs
aimed
at
a
running
indian
and
fired
his
two
remaining
close
companions
in
this
war
levi
and
armand
lay
shooting
on
either
side
of
him
hodge
was
dead
his
body
sprawled
a
few
feet
behind
them
and
that
by
itself
brought
raoul
close
to
panic
he
had
always
felt
the
big
redheaded
backwoodsman
could
never
be
hurt
arrows
flew
thick
and
fast
raoul
and
his
men
reloading
from
the
cartridge
and
shot
cases
they
had
carried
ashore
kept
up
a
steady
answering
fire
he
felt
shame
smouldering
in
his
spine
and
along
his
limbs
what
a
damned
fool
he
been
he
had
been
so
sure
that
storm
of
grapeshot
from
the
would
finish
off
the
indians
he
had
expected
this
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
stroll
through
the
forest
counting
the
dead
and
killing
off
the
helpless
remnant
instead
it
seemed
there
were
plenty
of
sauk
warriors
left
very
much
alive
fierce
as
wolverines
and
he
and
his
men
were
trapped
at
the
tip
of
this
damned
island
with
no
place
to
retreat
but
the
river
in
the
river
they
be
helpless
under
enemy
arrows
and
bullets
just
like
the
redskins
who
had
tried
earlier
to
swim
away
the
sauk
war
cries
had
fallen
silent
and
the
shots
and
arrows
had
stopped
raoul
peered
through
a
chink
in
the
tree
trunks
piled
before
him
all
he
could
see
was
dark
green
boughs
with
no
sign
of
movement
what
you
figger
they
doing
now
levi
said
he
had
his
six
pistols
laid
out
on
a
log
in
front
of
him
probably
getting
ready
to
charge
us
said
raoul
how
long
before
the
got
back
from
here
at
the
south
end
of
the
island
he
could
see
the
white
steamship
anchored
off
the
riverbank
her
two
black
stacks
giving
off
little
white
puffs
her
side
paddle
wheels
motionless
she
looked
very
small
and
very
far
away
no
chance
helmer
or
kingsbury
could
see
that
raoul
and
his
men
were
fighting
for
their
lives
here
what
were
the
men
levi
and
armand
and
the
others
thinking
again
and
again
it
seemed
his
decisions
cost
lives
he
remembered
old
creek
de
marion
run
and
he
felt
his
face
get
fiery
hot
at
the
shame
of
it
and
then
there
was
eli
greenglove
bitterness
that
night
they
parted
accusing
him
of
putting
clarissa
and
the
boys
in
harm
way
and
something
about
a
shock
raoul
would
get
what
had
eli
meant
by
that
he
heard
a
splash
and
turned
to
look
behind
him
his
heart
stopped
a
indian
was
rushing
at
him
out
of
the
water
scalping
knife
high
hands
trembling
raoul
had
barely
time
to
roll
over
on
his
back
and
fire
his
rifle
up
at
the
screaming
warrior
sunlight
glinted
off
the
long
steel
blade
there
was
a
moment
of
black
terror
after
the
rifle
went
off
nothing
seemed
to
happen
his
hands
had
been
shaking
too
hard
he
thought
to
aim
well
but
then
the
sauk
dropped
to
his
knees
and
fell
over
on
his
side
the
knife
dropped
from
his
hand
seeing
he
was
safe
for
this
instant
raoul
took
another
cartridge
out
of
his
case
and
shoved
it
into
the
breech
the
indian
rolled
over
and
pushed
himself
up
on
his
hands
and
knees
a
long
string
of
blood
and
spittle
dangling
from
his
mouth
calmer
now
raoul
took
careful
aim
and
put
a
bullet
in
the
shaven
brown
skull
two
more
dripping
indians
were
charging
out
of
the
water
rifles
went
off
beside
raoul
one
sauk
fell
then
the
other
just
as
he
was
swinging
his
tomahawk
at
a
man
on
the
right
end
of
raoul
line
the
militiaman
screamed
the
steel
head
of
the
tomahawk
was
buried
in
his
leg
see
to
him
armand
raoul
said
armand
crouching
ran
over
to
the
wounded
man
but
first
he
attended
to
the
fallen
indian
next
to
him
he
grabbed
the
brave
head
and
twisted
it
around
raoul
heard
the
crack
of
bones
to
make
bien
sure
armand
said
teeth
flashing
in
his
brown
beard
three
men
dead
two
wounded
eight
men
left
maybe
a
hundred
sauk
warriors
out
there
maybe
more
a
stupid
time
to
die
right
when
the
war
almost
raoul
gnawed
on
the
ends
of
his
mustache
and
peered
into
the
impenetrable
forest
he
and
his
men
were
all
going
to
die
he
was
sure
of
it
he
felt
fear
but
more
painful
than
the
fear
was
an
ache
in
his
heart
for
all
that
he
was
going
to
lose
all
that
was
due
him
that
life
had
paid
out
to
him
like
he
deserved
he
wanted
so
much
to
live
a
line
of
indians
came
out
of
the
trees
some
with
rifles
some
with
bows
and
arrows
there
must
be
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
they
whooping
as
they
usually
did
they
were
silent
their
eyes
big
their
mouths
set
in
lipless
lines
they
were
like
walking
dead
men
coming
at
him
that
was
what
they
were
they
knew
they
were
going
to
die
but
they
were
going
to
take
this
little
band
of
white
men
with
them
raoul
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
curling
up
behind
his
tree
barricade
head
in
his
arms
whimpering
with
grief
and
fear
he
made
himself
aim
and
fire
the
indian
he
picked
out
as
a
target
kept
on
coming
done
he
thought
over
and
over
again
done
slowly
he
did
not
seem
able
to
move
quickly
he
inserted
another
cartridge
into
the
breech
of
his
rifle
all
around
him
rifles
were
going
off
with
deafening
booms
and
from
behind
him
there
was
more
booming
he
looked
up
indians
were
falling
one
here
one
there
then
three
then
two
more
their
line
was
breaking
up
the
men
are
shooting
good
he
heard
voices
behind
him
and
looked
around
at
the
same
moment
levi
pope
said
well
here
be
a
sight
to
welcome
ten
feet
or
so
behind
him
a
line
of
men
in
coonskin
caps
and
gray
shirts
were
methodically
firing
over
his
head
he
been
so
lost
in
panic
and
despair
he
had
heard
them
coming
he
looked
back
at
the
indians
brown
bodies
lay
tumbled
on
the
ground
some
only
a
few
feet
from
his
barricade
those
on
their
feet
were
backing
up
they
melted
into
the
tattered
forest
for
a
moment
raoul
could
not
move
he
lay
clutching
his
rifle
with
a
grip
so
hard
it
hurt
his
hands
panting
heavily
it
safe
now
levi
pope
said
quietly
standing
up
raoul
pushed
himself
to
his
feet
his
legs
were
shaking
so
hard
he
could
barely
stand
he
looked
around
and
saw
militiamen
wading
across
to
the
island
from
the
east
bank
of
the
mississippi
the
men
who
had
been
skirmishing
in
the
forest
north
of
the
bad
axe
must
have
seen
the
fighting
on
the
island
too
dazed
even
to
feel
happy
raoul
stood
taking
long
breaths
and
watched
the
militiamen
come
he
had
never
in
his
life
needed
a
drink
more
than
he
did
now
and
he
had
forgotten
to
bring
any
whiskey
with
him
the
southern
tip
of
the
island
was
soon
crowded
with
riflemen
three
dead
were
stretched
out
under
blankets
and
a
burly
horse
doctor
from
the
mining
country
was
bandaging
the
leg
of
the
man
with
the
tomahawk
wound
colonel
henry
dodge
said
a
tall
officer
wearing
a
bicorn
hat
he
shook
hands
with
raoul
we
almost
neighbors
i
from
dodgeville
settlement
just
a
little
ways
north
of
galena
i
damned
glad
you
came
over
colonel
said
raoul
feeling
like
a
fool
to
have
gotten
himself
trapped
the
sauk
still
seem
to
have
a
power
of
fighting
men
left
glad
you
saved
a
few
for
us
there
were
only
about
two
dozen
redskins
on
the
north
side
of
the
bad
axe
they
let
us
see
them
to
draw
us
away
i
guess
from
the
main
body
hiding
out
here
but
the
way
you
were
blasting
this
island
with
grape
i
was
afraid
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
bury
indians
or
pieces
of
them
dodge
ordered
his
men
to
spread
out
in
two
lines
one
behind
the
other
across
the
width
of
the
island
raoul
positioned
his
little
party
in
the
center
of
the
foremost
line
advance
my
brave
suckers
dodge
called
and
the
men
laughed
at
the
nickname
for
illinoisians
holding
up
a
long
cavalry
saber
dodge
led
the
militia
line
bayonets
leveled
into
the
broken
trees
raoul
looked
downriver
for
the
she
had
dropped
a
wooden
ramp
to
the
riverbank
and
regulars
were
boarding
when
they
got
here
there
would
be
enough
soldiers
on
the
island
to
wipe
out
the
indians
ten
times
over
that
would
be
zachary
taylor
outfit
from
fort
crawford
raoul
had
heard
that
the
five
hundred
federal
troops
sent
from
the
east
had
been
decimated
by
cholera
though
their
commander
winfield
scott
was
still
on
the
way
here
raoul
turned
and
pushed
forward
stumbling
over
tree
trunks
shoving
branches
out
of
the
way
with
his
rifle
muscles
rigid
against
the
arrow
he
feared
would
come
whistling
out
of
the
gloomy
shadows
ahead
he
saw
no
living
indians
but
many
mangled
corpses
he
tripped
over
a
bare
brown
severed
leg
a
moccasin
flaps
decorated
with
undulating
red
white
and
black
beadwork
was
still
on
the
foot
three
indians
swinging
tomahawks
and
war
clubs
sprang
out
from
behind
a
pile
of
birch
trees
raoul
and
the
men
flanking
him
started
shooting
the
indians
were
riddled
before
they
got
within
ten
feet
raoul
was
sure
he
killed
one
of
the
warriors
he
went
to
the
body
drew
his
bowie
knife
and
gripped
the
long
black
scalplock
he
carved
a
circle
with
the
sharp
point
in
the
shaved
skin
around
the
scalplock
white
bone
showed
through
when
he
pulled
the
patch
of
skin
loose
the
round
spot
quickly
filling
with
blood
the
scalplock
was
long
enough
to
let
him
tie
it
around
his
belt
the
hair
felt
coarser
than
a
white
man
they
pressed
on
into
the
forest
again
and
again
meeting
desperate
little
bands
of
red
men
who
rushed
them
only
to
be
felled
by
a
hail
of
lead
balls
raoul
heard
the
constant
banging
of
many
rifles
going
off
in
other
parts
of
the
forest
and
sometimes
he
heard
the
high
screams
of
women
and
children
after
the
screams
silence
raoul
smiled
to
himself
this
was
how
he
wanted
it
no
prisoners
killing
no
longer
seemed
dangerous
it
no
longer
felt
like
sport
it
became
simply
work
through
the
day
heat
it
was
tiring
work
but
good
with
some
surprise
raoul
realized
that
the
line
of
troops
had
swept
most
of
the
island
and
were
now
approaching
the
north
end
he
could
see
indians
up
ahead
through
the
trees
this
might
well
be
the
last
of
them
eagerly
rifle
ready
he
rushed
forward
he
burst
into
a
clearing
and
found
himself
facing
a
half
circle
of
nearly
a
dozen
bucks
their
shaved
scalps
and
bare
chests
gleaming
with
sweat
behind
them
cowered
a
pack
of
squaws
and
children
the
warriors
shouted
at
raoul
and
his
men
and
beckoned
to
them
right
in
the
center
was
one
man
much
taller
than
the
rest
with
the
red
and
white
feathers
of
a
brave
tied
into
his
scalplock
whatever
insults
or
challenges
he
was
uttering
he
looked
raoul
right
in
the
eye
and
shouted
directly
at
him
raoul
felt
a
chill
of
fear
the
indian
flesh
was
wasted
but
his
skeleton
was
huge
he
looked
like
he
be
as
hard
to
stop
as
a
tornado
and
he
was
holding
a
rifle
in
arms
and
hands
so
big
that
they
made
it
look
small
the
other
warriors
did
have
rifles
or
even
bows
they
must
have
run
out
of
powder
and
shot
and
arrows
they
held
clubs
and
knives
and
tomahawks
want
us
to
fight
hand
to
hand
that
what
indians
do
to
show
their
hell
with
with
a
movement
that
seemed
almost
contemptuous
the
big
indian
dropped
the
rifle
to
the
ground
he
reached
down
and
picked
up
a
war
club
painted
red
and
black
with
a
huge
spike
at
its
end
let
pay
back
boys
raoul
shouted
for
all
of
our
people
they
killed
oui
for
marchette
said
armand
raising
his
rifle
his
first
shot
caught
a
warrior
in
the
chest
and
knocked
him
down
at
that
the
indians
rushed
raoul
and
his
men
raoul
felt
himself
trembling
uncontrollably
as
the
bony
giant
in
the
center
came
straight
at
him
the
big
indian
held
his
war
club
in
front
of
him
as
if
to
deflect
bullets
forcing
his
arms
to
hold
steady
raoul
aimed
his
rifle
at
the
head
and
fired
and
missed
should
have
aimed
at
his
raoul
cursed
his
shaking
hand
as
he
dropped
his
rifle
and
pulled
his
pistol
the
brown
giant
gave
a
long
war
cry
raoul
pulled
the
trigger
he
saw
a
spark
heard
the
bang
of
the
percussion
cap
but
there
was
nothing
more
he
cried
out
in
a
fury
his
sweat
must
have
dampened
the
powder
the
club
came
down
on
the
pistol
and
raoul
to
his
horror
felt
it
knocked
out
of
his
hand
again
the
big
indian
screamed
out
his
war
whoop
and
raised
the
club
high
raoul
empty
hand
fumbled
for
his
bowie
knife
he
had
it
out
a
death
grip
on
the
hilt
he
lunged
at
his
enemy
a
jolt
ran
through
raoul
arm
to
his
shoulder
as
the
point
of
the
knife
sank
deep
between
two
thick
ribs
the
indian
gave
a
deep
groan
and
staggered
back
he
swung
his
club
but
too
late
raoul
felt
a
numbing
blow
just
where
his
neck
met
his
shoulder
and
fell
to
his
knees
he
was
looking
right
into
the
dark
brown
eyes
of
the
indian
who
had
also
fallen
the
eyes
were
unblinking
dead
the
massive
body
collapsed
against
him
raoul
shouted
a
wordless
cry
of
rage
and
a
red
curtain
swept
over
his
eyes
he
jerked
the
knife
out
releasing
a
cataract
of
blood
with
an
effort
that
wrenched
his
arms
he
hurled
the
brown
giant
away
from
him
taking
a
scalp
was
enough
after
a
fight
like
that
raoul
got
a
firm
grip
on
the
thick
hank
of
black
hair
in
the
center
of
his
enemy
head
and
brought
the
knife
down
on
the
brown
throat
chopping
and
slicing
and
sawing
as
if
butchering
a
steer
raoul
cut
through
the
thick
neck
until
at
last
the
head
came
free
he
lofted
the
head
in
his
left
hand
looking
up
at
the
dead
eyes
there
you
goddamned
redskin
son
of
a
bitch
thought
you
could
kill
me
huh
a
shrill
woman
voice
broke
in
on
his
triumph
he
turned
to
see
a
witchlike
woman
wrapped
in
a
blanket
her
finger
was
pointing
at
him
her
voice
went
on
and
on
screeching
at
him
she
was
tall
but
starvation
had
stripped
the
flesh
from
her
bones
her
sunken
eyes
seemed
to
glow
in
her
face
he
felt
as
if
he
was
facing
some
horrid
spectre
he
threw
the
warrior
head
down
curse
him
would
she
he
snarled
like
an
angry
wolf
as
he
reached
for
the
woman
she
did
even
try
to
get
away
he
seized
the
scrawny
neck
and
pulled
her
to
him
bringing
the
bowie
knife
point
up
against
her
throat
she
started
singing
a
weird
caterwauling
he
heard
something
like
it
before
where
when
he
been
about
to
shoot
auguste
and
those
two
other
indians
at
old
man
creek
they
sung
like
that
right
at
the
end
her
dark
eyes
held
him
they
were
not
clouded
over
with
anger
or
terror
but
clear
with
full
understanding
that
he
was
going
to
kill
her
she
was
not
afraid
he
wished
he
could
frighten
her
force
her
to
grovel
but
someone
might
try
to
stop
him
from
doing
it
her
voice
went
on
and
on
chanting
up
and
down
he
silence
her
now
redskin
bitch
he
drove
the
knife
into
her
throat
and
jerked
it
sideways
her
song
ended
in
a
sickening
rasp
still
the
brown
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
her
blood
spurted
out
of
the
gash
he
had
cut
open
splashed
over
his
knife
blade
poured
hot
on
his
hand
it
spread
down
over
her
dress
and
over
the
gold
lace
on
his
sleeve
he
looked
down
at
his
red
hand
and
felt
some
force
within
him
stretch
his
lips
and
bare
his
teeth
he
thrust
the
woman
away
from
him
her
eyes
were
still
open
but
she
looked
at
no
one
and
nothing
she
fell
to
the
ground
like
a
bundle
of
sticks
she
lay
on
her
back
the
deep
wound
in
her
throat
spread
wide
her
eyes
staring
up
he
stood
over
her
and
saw
that
something
shiny
had
fallen
out
of
the
front
of
her
dress
and
lay
beside
her
head
tied
around
her
neck
with
a
purple
ribbon
was
an
oval
metal
case
splashed
with
blood
he
had
seen
the
case
or
one
like
it
he
reached
down
with
the
knife
and
slashed
the
ribbon
he
wiped
his
knife
on
his
jacket
and
slammed
it
into
its
sheath
then
picked
up
the
slippery
case
and
opened
it
a
pair
of
spectacles
round
gold
frames
thick
glass
lenses
they
looked
exactly
like
pierre
old
spectacles
was
that
possible
how
could
this
indian
woman
have
gotten
them
stolen
from
victoire
when
the
sauk
burned
it
or
had
the
mongrel
somehow
gotten
his
father
spectacles
taken
them
with
him
when
he
fled
from
victor
pierre
watch
had
disappeared
then
raoul
was
sure
auguste
had
stolen
it
and
if
this
woman
had
glasses
now
could
she
be
the
sauk
woman
pierre
had
lived
with
the
mother
of
his
bastard
son
despite
the
august
heat
beating
down
on
the
clearing
the
air
around
raoul
suddenly
felt
winter
cold
all
day
long
while
he
fought
the
indians
he
struggled
with
his
fear
of
being
killed
now
a
worse
fear
had
him
in
its
grip
a
fear
of
something
worse
than
death
of
having
called
down
upon
himself
a
vengeance
that
would
follow
him
beyond
the
grave
god
i
just
killed
pierre
the
spectacles
stared
up
at
him
like
accusing
eyes
the
flesh
of
his
back
prickled
he
shut
the
case
and
dropped
it
into
his
pocket
if
it
was
pierre
he
could
just
throw
it
away
the
few
remaining
indians
a
flock
of
women
and
children
huddled
weeping
with
their
backs
to
a
big
tree
arms
around
one
another
some
were
already
wounded
and
screaming
in
pain
tiredly
raoul
told
himself
he
must
reload
rifle
and
pistol
and
get
on
with
the
killing
but
his
anger
was
spent
he
felt
empty
worn
out
from
somewhere
behind
him
came
a
shout
of
cease
fire
it
was
welcome
he
done
enough
yonder
come
the
bluebellies
said
levi
ah
merde
muttered
armand
standing
with
bayonet
above
a
pile
of
bodies
raoul
looked
around
the
order
to
stop
the
shooting
had
come
from
their
rear
from
a
short
stout
officer
who
as
dodge
had
was
advancing
with
drawn
saber
colonel
zachary
taylor
taylor
looked
around
the
smoking
glade
at
the
dead
big
bodies
and
little
ones
brown
flesh
and
tan
deerskin
splashed
with
bright
red
eyes
staring
limbs
jesus
christ
he
turned
to
raoul
pain
in
his
bright
blue
eyes
raoul
felt
his
face
grow
hot
colonel
he
said
you
understand
why
we
had
to
taylor
expression
changed
from
sadness
to
weariness
i
been
out
on
the
frontier
for
over
twenty
years
i
do
see
anything
here
that
i
have
seen
before
he
turned
away
before
raoul
could
answer
and
called
lieutenant
davis
a
tall
young
officer
with
a
handsome
angular
face
came
up
to
him
and
saluted
taylor
said
jeff
run
ahead
and
make
sure
any
indians
left
on
this
island
get
a
chance
to
surrender
he
turned
to
raoul
again
shaking
his
head
why
let
them
surrender
raoul
said
there
only
a
few
left
alive
said
taylor
and
we
not
going
to
kill
them
and
if
you
need
a
reason
it
because
i
would
feel
right
about
it
and
i
know
a
lot
of
the
men
would
feel
right
about
it
taylor
turned
to
one
of
his
men
a
trooper
with
a
thick
blond
mustache
sergeant
benson
get
me
that
sauk
man
we
captured
we
be
needing
to
talk
to
the
indians
we
want
to
find
out
what
happened
to
black
hawk
raoul
was
painfully
aware
that
taylor
eyes
had
shifted
to
his
right
hand
covered
with
blood
he
wanted
to
hide
it
behind
his
back
he
looked
raoul
up
and
down
good
god
man
do
you
know
you
got
blood
all
over
you
enemy
blood
said
raoul
i
see
you
got
a
scalp
tied
to
your
belt
taylor
said
general
atkinson
issued
an
order
against
mutilating
enemy
dead
raoul
felt
himself
shaking
again
not
with
fear
but
with
anger
i
saw
one
of
my
best
friends
shot
dead
with
an
arrow
through
the
throat
today
and
this
taylor
asked
pointing
to
the
severed
head
of
the
big
brave
lying
a
few
feet
from
raoul
boots
was
this
to
avenge
your
friend
too
you
better
get
back
to
your
steamship
de
marion
i
do
think
we
have
any
more
need
of
your
services
here
it
was
not
so
much
taylor
words
but
the
mingled
contempt
and
pity
in
his
voice
that
enraged
raoul
his
fist
clenched
on
the
handle
of
his
knife
taylor
wore
a
pistol
and
carried
a
saber
but
he
was
a
far
smaller
man
than
raoul
and
his
stout
body
dressed
today
in
a
blue
jacket
and
fringed
buckskin
boots
seemed
to
invite
attack
taylor
calm
blue
eyes
went
to
raoul
hand
then
back
to
his
face
he
stood
motionless
waiting
what
am
i
thinking
the
regulars
would
shoot
me
down
the
minute
i
drew
this
raoul
silently
beckoned
to
his
men
and
started
back
through
the
broken
trees
the
way
they
had
come
after
walking
a
short
distance
raoul
saw
the
sergeant
taylor
had
sent
behind
the
lines
coming
toward
him
with
an
indian
walking
beside
him
raoul
glanced
at
the
indian
and
stopped
dead
he
felt
as
if
the
arrow
he
been
expecting
and
fearing
all
day
had
finally
struck
him
are
no
but
auguste
could
be
alive
he
been
shot
to
death
at
old
creek
was
this
what
killing
pierre
squaw
had
brought
on
him
the
man
before
him
had
gone
hungry
for
a
long
time
his
almost
face
was
a
chilling
reminder
of
the
woman
whose
throat
raoul
had
slashed
but
his
gauntness
also
made
him
look
more
like
pierre
than
ever
before
his
buckskin
leggings
like
those
of
the
indians
raoul
had
just
killed
were
dirty
and
full
of
rips
and
holes
but
the
pale
scar
line
running
down
his
cheek
and
those
five
parallel
scars
on
his
bare
chest
left
raoul
in
no
doubt
who
this
was
auguste
dark
eyes
burned
at
raoul
alight
with
a
fierce
hatred
the
sergeant
pulled
auguste
by
the
arm
as
the
mongrel
turned
raoul
suddenly
saw
that
the
middle
of
his
ear
was
missing
the
empty
space
bordered
by
partly
healed
red
flesh
stunned
speechless
raoul
looked
at
levi
and
armand
who
stared
back
at
him
they
could
speak
either
they
were
just
as
shaken
still
burning
at
taylor
dismissal
of
him
raoul
was
staggered
by
the
shock
of
this
meeting
but
he
saw
one
thing
clear
all
right
auguste
was
still
alive
that
meant
raoul
revenge
on
the
sauk
was
not
complete
auguste
was
a
traitor
auguste
was
a
murderer
and
raoul
was
going
to
work
day
and
night
to
get
him
hanged
the
red
blanket
longing
to
hear
that
white
bear
was
safe
redbird
could
not
stop
thinking
about
him
she
sat
on
the
ground
with
floating
lily
bundled
in
a
blanket
on
her
lap
she
gazed
out
at
the
small
lake
where
black
hawk
and
his
few
remaining
followers
had
set
up
camp
this
was
a
peaceful
place
but
with
white
bear
gone
and
her
dread
of
what
might
have
happened
to
her
loved
ones
at
the
bad
axe
she
could
feel
no
peace
a
lovely
place
this
lake
said
owl
carver
sitting
beside
her
it
is
far
from
white
the
thought
of
white
bear
having
to
make
his
way
through
winnebago
country
haunted
her
she
longed
to
look
into
the
birch
forest
behind
her
and
see
him
walking
toward
her
through
the
white
tree
trunks
she
missed
yellow
hair
and
woodrow
too
they
were
to
her
another
sister
another
son
she
hoped
that
by
now
they
were
out
of
danger
she
had
left
so
many
people
behind
at
the
bad
axe
people
who
had
always
been
part
of
her
life
sun
woman
iron
knife
her
two
sisters
in
the
seven
days
since
black
hawk
had
led
their
little
group
north
on
the
ridge
trail
leading
to
chippewa
country
there
had
been
no
word
from
the
rest
of
the
band
redbird
fear
for
the
people
she
loved
was
like
a
ferret
eating
away
at
her
insides
from
his
medicine
bag
owl
carver
took
the
pale
eyes
time
teller
white
bear
had
given
him
and
opened
its
gold
outer
shell
redbird
saw
black
markings
on
its
inner
surface
and
two
black
arrows
it
tell
me
when
white
bear
will
come
back
the
old
shaman
dangled
the
time
teller
by
its
gold
chain
over
floating
lily
tiny
head
the
gold
disk
gave
off
a
regular
clicking
sound
like
the
beating
of
a
metal
heart
floating
lily
brown
eyes
opened
wide
and
her
lips
curved
in
a
wide
toothless
smile
eagle
feather
sitting
beside
redbird
said
grandfather
is
it
right
to
use
a
sacred
thing
just
to
make
the
baby
smile
owl
carver
smiled
his
face
these
days
seemed
to
have
caved
in
all
of
his
front
teeth
were
gone
and
his
mouth
was
as
sunken
as
floating
lily
while
his
chin
and
his
nose
jutted
out
a
baby
smile
is
also
a
sacred
thing
redbird
said
have
you
asked
the
spirits
what
has
become
of
the
rest
of
our
people
from
a
cord
around
his
waist
owl
carver
untied
a
medicine
bag
decorated
with
a
beadwork
owl
he
opened
it
let
little
gray
scraps
sift
through
his
fingers
and
sighed
last
night
i
chewed
bits
of
sacred
mushroom
owl
carver
said
i
saw
pale
eyes
things
lodges
that
travel
over
the
ground
on
trails
made
of
metal
smoking
boats
with
bonfires
in
their
bellies
villages
as
big
as
prairies
crowds
of
pale
eyes
seemed
to
be
cheering
for
me
it
made
no
sense
it
told
me
nothing
about
what
happened
at
the
bad
axe
maybe
i
took
too
much
redbird
glanced
down
at
eagle
feather
his
mouth
was
a
circle
and
his
blue
eyes
as
he
stared
up
at
owl
carver
were
so
wide
that
she
could
see
the
whites
above
and
below
them
he
strained
toward
owl
carver
his
longing
to
follow
his
father
and
grandfather
in
the
way
of
the
shaman
showing
in
every
line
of
his
body
she
had
always
felt
that
same
longing
let
me
try
your
sacred
mushrooms
said
redbird
sun
woman
says
sometimes
women
can
see
into
places
where
men
can
not
see
owl
carver
set
the
medicine
bag
down
between
himself
and
eagle
feather
he
sliced
his
hand
through
the
air
palm
down
in
refusal
the
magic
might
get
into
your
milk
and
be
bad
for
the
baby
resentment
was
a
bitter
taste
in
redbird
mouth
but
she
had
to
admit
there
was
no
telling
what
the
mushrooms
might
do
to
floating
unformed
spirit
still
she
knew
owl
carver
welcomed
that
excuse
because
he
did
not
want
to
give
the
mushrooms
to
a
woman
eagle
feather
shouted
look
he
pointed
up
at
the
sky
owl
carver
and
redbird
both
looked
up
scanning
the
cloudless
midday
sky
for
a
moment
she
saw
two
tiny
black
shapes
high
up
circling
slowly
eagles
said
the
boy
my
guardian
spirits
redbird
squinted
yes
those
were
the
wings
of
eagles
the
birds
were
searching
for
prey
like
the
long
knives
and
their
winnebago
allies
their
remorseless
circling
frightened
her
those
bright
blue
eyes
of
eagle
feather
saw
farther
than
hers
did
thought
redbird
she
looked
down
at
him
proudly
as
he
wiped
his
hand
across
his
mouth
and
smiled
up
at
her
his
pointed
chin
reminded
her
of
white
bear
if
the
winnebago
find
us
here
will
they
kill
us
she
asked
her
father
owl
carver
waved
his
hands
they
are
not
our
enemies
but
they
will
do
what
the
long
knives
demand
in
a
strange
voice
eagle
feather
said
mother
frightened
by
his
flat
tone
she
reached
for
him
but
with
the
baby
in
her
lap
she
could
not
get
to
him
before
eagle
feather
fell
over
on
his
side
with
his
eyes
shut
she
screamed
she
laid
floating
lily
on
the
ground
and
picked
up
eagle
feather
he
lay
limp
in
her
arms
his
head
lolling
his
mouth
hanging
open
after
all
they
had
been
through
this
was
more
than
she
could
bear
she
burst
into
tears
her
heart
thudding
like
a
deerskin
drum
what
is
it
she
turned
to
owl
carver
help
him
the
shaman
crouched
over
his
grandson
looking
down
into
his
face
bending
low
to
sniff
his
breath
redbird
be
very
quiet
we
must
not
wake
him
what
happened
to
him
she
whispered
trembling
this
he
gestured
to
the
open
medicine
bag
that
lay
where
he
and
eagle
feather
had
been
sitting
he
must
have
taken
some
bits
of
mushroom
while
we
were
looking
up
at
the
eagles
terror
cascaded
over
her
what
will
it
do
to
him
owl
carver
emptied
the
gray
scraps
into
his
hand
and
then
poured
them
back
into
the
bag
what
a
foolish
old
man
i
am
leaving
that
bag
open
right
next
to
him
eagle
feather
had
gone
on
a
spirit
journey
and
her
own
sensitivity
to
the
other
world
told
her
that
he
was
to
she
felt
for
him
the
fear
she
had
felt
for
white
bear
in
that
moon
of
ice
no
said
redbird
sadly
you
were
not
foolish
it
was
way
he
sent
those
eagles
to
take
our
eyes
away
from
the
medicine
bag
with
infinite
care
so
as
not
to
disturb
him
redbird
carried
eagle
feather
into
the
resting
his
head
on
the
blanket
roll
that
held
everything
she
had
been
able
to
carry
i
will
stay
with
you
until
eagle
feather
comes
back
said
owl
carver
redbird
picked
up
floating
lily
and
held
her
tightly
as
the
sun
crossed
above
the
lake
they
sat
watching
the
small
still
body
redbird
could
barely
see
eagle
feather
narrow
chest
rise
and
fall
in
the
shadowy
there
were
moments
when
she
was
sure
he
was
dead
sunset
had
turned
the
small
lake
to
a
sheet
of
beaten
gold
when
eagle
feather
sat
up
suddenly
his
eyes
wide
the
bad
axe
he
shrieked
it
was
the
voice
of
a
child
struggling
with
a
nightmare
eagle
feather
redbird
cried
owl
carver
put
his
hand
on
her
knee
be
quiet
the
bad
axe
eagle
feather
called
out
again
staring
at
something
no
one
else
could
see
the
great
river
runs
red
his
eyes
closed
and
he
fell
back
redbird
felt
as
if
she
were
shivering
in
a
blizzard
eagle
words
seemed
to
open
a
doorway
of
second
sight
in
her
own
mind
disclosing
a
horrifying
vision
of
bodies
drifting
in
water
she
heard
a
sound
behind
her
suddenly
terrified
she
whirled
in
the
birch
forest
she
saw
a
man
riding
toward
them
on
a
gray
pony
the
beat
of
hooves
sounded
hollow
among
the
trees
feeling
on
the
edge
of
madness
she
let
out
a
scream
she
had
wanted
so
much
for
white
bear
to
come
to
her
that
way
that
she
thought
for
a
moment
it
was
he
like
white
bear
his
head
was
unshaved
his
hair
long
but
as
he
came
closer
through
the
white
tree
trunks
a
hand
raised
in
greeting
she
saw
he
was
not
white
bear
his
full
head
of
hair
had
a
brave
feathers
tied
into
it
a
winnebago
she
saw
a
second
rider
behind
him
an
attack
but
they
were
approaching
slowly
their
hands
empty
the
winnebago
dismounted
and
led
his
pony
till
he
was
standing
over
them
he
wore
four
red
and
white
feathers
one
hanging
from
each
silver
earring
two
tied
into
his
hair
a
leader
of
warriors
heart
pounding
she
moved
protectively
closer
to
the
where
eagle
feather
lay
owl
carver
slowly
got
to
his
feet
she
glanced
at
him
and
when
she
saw
how
grim
his
face
was
her
own
terror
increased
another
winnebago
rode
out
of
the
woods
dismounted
and
stood
beside
his
companion
the
first
man
turned
to
take
something
from
his
saddle
scooping
floating
lily
up
in
her
arms
redbird
leaped
up
to
give
the
alarm
the
brave
held
out
a
restraining
hand
wait
we
are
two
only
and
we
come
to
talk
peace
the
man
spoke
sauk
he
faced
her
smiling
tentatively
and
held
up
a
beautiful
calumet
its
red
pipestone
bowl
gleaming
in
the
sunset
its
polished
hickory
stem
as
long
as
a
man
arm
owl
carver
drew
himself
up
in
all
his
shaman
majesty
who
are
you
i
am
called
wave
said
the
man
holding
the
calumet
this
is
he
who
lights
the
water
he
does
not
speak
sauk
redbird
glanced
down
into
the
to
make
sure
eagle
feather
was
all
right
who
is
in
the
wave
asked
a
little
suspiciously
as
he
who
lights
the
water
stepped
forward
to
look
in
my
grandson
said
owl
carver
he
is
sick
many
of
you
must
be
sick
and
hungry
said
wave
time
your
leaders
took
pity
on
the
women
and
children
and
ended
this
war
more
sauk
men
and
women
were
coming
over
now
to
see
the
newcomers
the
two
winnebago
were
men
of
courage
redbird
thought
coming
alone
as
they
had
into
a
camp
of
fifty
or
more
desperate
people
redbird
mother
came
to
stand
beside
owl
carver
she
asked
what
was
wrong
with
eagle
feather
and
owl
carver
explained
in
a
whisper
children
will
eat
anything
they
can
get
their
hands
on
wind
bends
grass
scolded
now
he
will
probably
grow
up
to
be
a
madman
redbird
held
back
a
shriek
of
rage
black
hawk
and
the
winnebago
prophet
strode
through
the
gathering
crowd
to
face
the
newcomers
black
hawk
carried
under
one
arm
one
of
those
heavy
paper
bundles
captured
at
old
man
creek
he
glanced
at
redbird
and
she
thought
she
saw
reproach
in
his
eyes
even
though
he
had
said
he
forgave
her
for
her
part
in
yellow
hair
and
woodrow
escape
flying
cloud
addressed
wave
in
a
strange
tongue
this
winnebago
brave
is
the
son
of
my
sister
said
the
prophet
pompously
in
sauk
he
think
that
means
we
are
saved
redbird
wondered
sick
of
the
winnebago
prophet
forever
claiming
that
victory
awaited
just
a
little
farther
along
the
trail
when
it
was
so
clear
that
the
trail
led
only
to
death
wave
said
in
sauk
my
father
is
a
sauk
who
married
into
the
winnebago
so
i
come
to
you
as
one
joined
with
you
by
blood
we
were
sent
by
the
chief
of
our
band
falcon
how
did
you
find
us
black
hawk
asked
one
of
our
hunters
was
passing
this
way
and
saw
your
camp
he
was
afraid
to
come
near
you
but
he
told
me
i
have
been
looking
for
you
for
many
days
wolf
paw
his
face
so
deeply
lined
that
he
looked
as
old
as
his
father
came
to
stand
beside
black
hawk
do
you
have
news
of
our
people
who
were
trying
to
cross
the
great
river
he
asked
he
touched
the
silver
coin
that
hung
around
his
neck
as
if
for
luck
dread
flowed
cold
through
redbird
arms
and
legs
we
will
wave
and
he
who
lights
the
water
looked
at
each
other
for
a
long
silent
moment
what
has
happened
black
hawk
pressed
them
the
long
knives
caught
up
with
them
said
wave
most
of
the
people
were
hiding
on
an
island
in
the
great
river
the
long
knives
had
a
smoke
boat
that
fired
a
thunder
gun
at
the
island
and
killed
many
people
then
the
long
knives
landed
on
the
island
and
killed
nearly
all
that
were
left
redbird
reeled
stunned
woman
my
second
mother
iron
knife
oh
no
o
earthmaker
let
it
not
be
cold
crept
over
her
as
she
remembered
eagle
feather
cry
bad
axe
the
great
river
runs
red
black
hawk
gave
a
cry
of
anguish
his
paper
bundle
dropped
to
the
ground
with
a
thud
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
picked
up
a
handful
of
ashes
from
redbird
campfire
and
threw
them
on
his
head
the
people
around
him
screamed
and
wept
and
held
one
another
in
their
grief
wind
bends
grass
fell
against
owl
carver
and
both
of
them
sank
to
the
ground
weeping
redbird
saw
wolf
paw
standing
slumped
and
motionless
his
arms
hanging
helpless
at
his
sides
his
face
gray
he
had
insisted
that
both
his
wives
and
his
four
children
try
to
cross
the
great
river
at
the
bad
axe
thinking
they
would
be
safer
sobbing
and
clutching
her
baby
redbird
watched
the
orange
sun
disappear
behind
the
pointed
treetops
on
the
western
shore
of
the
little
lake
she
thought
iron
knife
so
strong
and
always
there
when
she
needed
him
must
be
gone
her
two
sisters
and
their
new
husbands
probably
dead
the
people
mourned
some
sitting
on
the
ground
some
walking
about
distractedly
some
standing
holding
each
other
and
now
eagle
feather
was
stricken
she
could
not
get
the
chill
out
of
her
body
when
it
was
dark
she
relit
her
fire
floating
lily
woke
and
cried
and
redbird
held
her
to
her
breast
then
she
crawled
under
her
to
look
at
eagle
feather
his
eyes
were
still
shut
he
had
not
moved
since
his
outcry
and
his
breathing
was
shallow
can
not
bear
this
eagle
feather
lying
as
if
dead
white
bear
vanished
most
of
my
people
have
i
been
spared
to
suffer
so
black
hawk
began
to
mourn
aloud
for
his
lost
people
the
rest
of
the
people
joined
in
the
wailing
redbird
noticed
that
wave
and
he
who
lights
the
water
cried
out
too
and
tears
ran
from
their
eyes
she
liked
them
for
joining
the
mourning
owl
carver
was
sitting
beside
her
holding
the
hands
of
weeping
wind
bends
grass
his
own
features
as
much
of
them
as
she
could
see
in
the
twilight
were
still
and
drawn
shrunken
by
sorrow
redbird
thought
the
sauk
were
known
far
and
wide
as
a
people
who
never
shirked
the
demands
of
honor
if
even
one
man
of
black
hawk
party
smoked
the
calumet
with
wave
that
would
oblige
black
hawk
and
his
remaining
braves
to
surrender
to
the
winnebago
and
make
peace
redbird
said
now
with
so
many
dead
can
we
have
peace
will
you
smoke
the
pipe
with
these
two
men
owl
carver
said
if
i
were
alone
i
would
smoke
the
pipe
with
them
but
i
will
not
go
against
black
hawk
we
are
all
that
is
left
of
the
band
she
said
someone
must
take
the
calumet
and
smoke
it
and
by
that
odious
sauk
custom
she
thought
clenching
her
jaw
it
would
have
to
be
a
man
as
darkness
deepened
the
wailing
died
down
wave
and
he
who
lights
the
water
made
a
little
fire
at
the
edge
of
the
lake
near
redbird
one
by
one
the
last
people
of
black
hawk
band
drifted
close
to
fire
the
winnebago
brave
stood
before
the
fire
holding
the
peace
pipe
twilight
lingered
in
the
sky
behind
him
while
the
firelight
before
him
illuminated
his
heavy
features
sitting
near
eagle
feather
redbird
looked
around
and
saw
silent
figures
standing
in
the
shadows
as
the
people
waited
to
hear
what
wave
had
to
say
gravely
he
took
tobacco
out
of
a
pouch
at
his
waist
and
filled
the
bowl
of
the
calumet
then
he
touched
a
dry
stick
to
his
fire
and
carried
the
flame
to
the
pipe
it
flared
up
bright
yellow
over
the
pipe
bowl
as
he
puffed
on
it
wave
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
in
a
strong
voice
earthmaker
gave
us
the
sacred
tobacco
as
a
means
of
making
peace
among
us
no
one
may
break
a
promise
sealed
with
tobacco
our
chief
falcon
asks
me
to
say
this
to
you
black
hawk
you
have
frightened
the
long
knives
greatly
brought
them
much
sorrow
and
forced
them
to
pursue
you
over
rivers
and
swamps
and
mountains
black
hawk
your
honor
has
been
satisfied
falcon
offers
this
tobacco
to
you
and
asks
that
you
end
this
war
for
the
sake
of
your
women
who
are
hungry
and
sick
and
your
children
who
are
without
fathers
let
it
be
done
let
this
war
be
over
before
all
of
us
are
redbird
heart
leaped
with
hope
as
she
saw
black
hawk
reach
toward
the
pipe
that
wave
held
out
to
him
he
was
about
to
take
it
and
smoke
it
but
his
hand
instead
of
grasping
only
pointed
at
the
pipe
i
will
not
smoke
this
pipe
i
believe
the
sauk
should
fight
on
until
they
can
not
fight
anymore
earthmaker
let
at
least
one
man
be
moved
to
stand
for
wave
added
more
tobacco
to
the
pipe
and
puffed
on
it
again
he
stood
before
the
winnebago
prophet
show
your
wisdom
uncle
smoke
the
sacred
tobacco
flying
cloud
took
a
step
backward
and
raised
both
arms
it
is
wrong
for
the
winnebago
to
turn
against
us
in
our
time
of
need
go
back
and
tell
your
chief
falcon
that
if
he
does
not
join
us
in
making
war
on
the
long
knives
they
will
take
his
land
from
him
as
they
have
taken
ours
from
us
he
crossed
his
arms
before
his
chest
despairing
redbird
realized
that
the
winnebago
prophet
could
not
smoke
the
pipe
because
that
would
be
admitting
that
all
his
advice
up
to
now
had
been
wrong
what
will
you
do
sauk
shaman
wave
said
to
owl
carver
do
not
the
spirits
tell
you
to
smoke
the
calumet
please
do
it
father
redbird
whispered
she
wanted
to
shout
it
aloud
but
she
held
her
tongue
she
remembered
with
pain
the
derision
of
wolf
paw
and
the
others
when
she
spoke
out
at
the
war
council
she
bit
her
lip
maybe
by
speaking
out
that
time
she
had
turned
people
away
from
the
path
she
wanted
them
to
take
she
would
not
make
that
mistake
again
owl
carver
said
black
hawk
has
always
been
my
chief
i
follow
where
he
leads
redbird
groaned
now
she
wished
she
had
spoken
out
eagle
feather
stirred
beside
her
heart
frozen
she
looked
down
at
him
but
he
was
motionless
again
wave
turned
next
to
wolf
paw
who
closed
his
eyes
bowed
his
head
and
made
no
move
to
accept
the
pipe
redbird
saw
that
the
red
crest
on
his
head
was
faded
and
limp
she
could
only
watch
as
the
two
winnebago
went
from
man
to
man
in
the
circle
of
firelight
holding
out
the
pipe
each
man
refusing
please
wave
pleaded
is
there
not
a
man
here
wise
and
strong
enough
to
smoke
the
calumet
and
save
the
lives
of
his
people
please
more
pain
and
death
is
needless
in
a
day
or
two
a
war
band
of
winnebago
would
come
after
black
party
they
would
greatly
outnumber
these
fifty
people
they
would
have
rifles
with
plenty
of
powder
and
shot
given
to
them
by
the
long
knives
they
would
slaughter
the
men
and
take
the
women
and
children
into
captivity
i
beg
you
do
not
let
your
children
she
heard
a
rustling
beside
her
she
gasped
in
fright
and
her
hands
went
cold
eagle
feather
was
up
on
his
hands
and
knees
the
boy
crawled
out
from
under
the
climbed
to
his
feet
and
stood
straight
a
hung
over
the
little
lake
and
she
could
see
eagle
set
face
one
side
red
with
firelight
and
the
other
pale
white
in
moonlight
his
bright
blue
eyes
fixed
on
wave
he
strode
forward
a
small
determined
figure
astonished
redbird
could
only
stand
and
watch
how
could
this
be
happening
he
stood
before
wave
and
held
up
his
hands
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
in
the
camp
disturbed
only
by
the
crackling
of
the
fire
and
the
rustling
of
the
birch
leaves
around
them
no
black
hawk
cried
his
rasping
voice
full
of
anguish
do
not
do
it
stop
the
winnebago
prophet
reached
for
eagle
feather
owl
carver
quickly
blocked
his
way
you
must
not
touch
him
he
returns
from
a
spirit
walk
solemnly
wave
handed
the
pipe
down
to
eagle
feather
others
took
up
the
cry
no
no
but
no
one
laid
a
hand
on
eagle
feather
and
many
were
silent
and
redbird
knew
that
she
was
not
the
only
one
in
the
camp
who
wanted
eagle
feather
to
smoke
the
pipe
awed
redbird
realized
that
the
spirits
hovered
over
eagle
feather
guiding
him
her
son
had
been
chosen
to
save
the
remnant
of
the
band
though
only
six
summers
had
passed
since
his
birth
she
felt
her
mouth
trembling
eagle
feather
put
the
mouthpiece
of
the
pipe
to
his
lips
and
drew
in
a
deep
puff
though
he
was
but
six
years
old
and
had
never
smoked
before
he
showed
no
pain
as
the
hot
smoke
filled
his
tender
mouth
nor
did
he
cough
redbird
heart
swelled
with
pride
eagle
feather
blew
the
smoke
out
again
a
single
puff
according
to
custom
wave
thick
features
were
breaking
in
tearful
relief
eagle
feather
had
known
just
what
to
do
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
in
anyone
mind
that
he
meant
to
do
what
he
had
done
he
held
the
pipe
up
to
wave
a
new
cry
of
pain
rose
from
black
hawk
and
the
winnebago
prophet
joined
him
as
loudly
but
redbird
heart
was
happy
she
hugged
floating
lily
their
long
agony
was
over
at
last
eagle
feather
turned
and
walked
back
to
her
straight
and
steady
as
if
he
had
not
been
lying
all
day
long
unconscious
she
quickly
handed
floating
lily
to
wind
bends
grass
knelt
down
and
held
her
arms
out
to
her
son
he
ran
into
them
and
they
held
each
other
tightly
it
was
good
that
you
smoked
the
pipe
very
good
eagle
feather
said
when
the
eagles
came
over
the
lake
my
spirit
self
whispered
to
me
to
eat
from
grandfather
medicine
bag
then
i
went
to
many
strange
places
and
saw
many
very
bad
things
the
long
knives
killed
many
people
at
the
end
of
it
all
i
lay
in
the
and
i
heard
a
voice
say
that
if
someone
would
smoke
the
calumet
there
would
be
peace
and
my
father
spirit
self
the
white
bear
came
to
me
and
told
me
to
smoke
white
bear
had
been
here
he
would
have
smoked
the
calumet
i
know
he
owl
carver
put
his
hand
on
eagle
feather
shoulder
the
boy
is
the
grandson
of
owl
carver
and
of
sun
woman
he
is
the
son
of
white
bear
he
has
had
his
first
vision
it
is
foreordained
that
he
should
be
a
great
shaman
redbird
felt
flames
burning
under
the
skin
of
her
face
he
is
the
son
of
redbird
as
well
she
said
her
voice
shaking
owl
carver
put
his
other
hand
on
redbird
shoulder
yes
he
is
your
son
suddenly
his
old
face
crumbled
and
all
my
other
children
are
gone
he
wept
redbird
you
are
the
only
one
left
redbird
trembled
as
she
saw
fort
crawford
a
great
square
formed
by
long
stone
lodges
connected
by
log
palisade
walls
long
knives
in
blue
jackets
surrounded
the
sauk
pointing
rifles
at
them
redbird
drew
the
sling
in
which
she
carried
floating
lily
around
from
her
back
to
hold
her
tight
with
one
hand
she
pulled
eagle
feather
who
stumbled
under
a
heavy
blanket
roll
close
to
her
you
will
all
camp
in
the
field
beside
the
fort
said
wave
if
anyone
tries
to
escape
those
left
behind
will
be
punished
redbird
heard
a
wordless
cry
from
behind
her
she
turned
and
was
astonished
to
see
a
group
of
gray
shadows
standing
in
a
meadow
outside
the
fort
she
saw
they
were
sauk
women
some
holding
babies
some
with
small
children
standing
beside
them
redbird
swung
floating
lily
around
to
her
back
and
rushed
to
the
silent
women
praying
that
among
them
she
would
see
sun
woman
or
her
sisters
she
moved
more
slowly
as
she
realized
that
the
eyes
of
each
silent
face
she
peered
into
were
lifeless
and
the
mouths
slack
these
few
she
grasped
with
horror
were
all
that
was
left
of
the
people
who
had
tried
to
cross
the
great
river
at
the
bad
axe
just
as
white
bear
had
predicted
she
came
to
water
flows
fast
barely
able
to
recognize
her
she
had
changed
terribly
a
change
that
had
begun
when
the
long
knives
killed
her
husband
three
horses
at
old
man
creek
the
older
woman
face
had
lost
its
roundness
her
cheeks
sagged
and
her
head
shook
with
a
constant
tremor
is
it
really
you
redbird
in
the
flesh
i
am
not
on
the
trail
of
souls
redbird
drew
water
flows
fast
to
her
redbird
they
killed
everybody
they
kept
killing
and
killing
they
would
not
stop
even
babies
i
do
know
why
i
still
alive
my
children
are
dead
they
tried
to
swim
away
and
the
long
knives
shot
them
in
the
water
wild
grape
redbird
younger
sister
rushed
up
to
her
they
fell
into
each
other
arms
weeping
redbird
had
never
loved
her
sister
as
much
as
she
did
at
this
moment
wild
grape
said
i
saw
robin
nest
die
she
stood
before
a
long
knife
she
was
holding
her
baby
son
she
begged
for
her
life
he
just
smiled
and
shot
her
she
dropped
the
baby
and
the
long
knife
shot
him
on
the
ground
they
would
have
killed
me
but
a
long
knife
chief
came
along
and
stopped
it
and
iron
knife
redbird
asked
what
about
iron
knife
wild
grape
drew
back
and
looked
at
redbird
with
huge
eyes
redbird
one
of
them
cut
off
iron
knife
head
redbird
screamed
as
wild
grape
babbled
on
yes
with
a
knife
this
big
she
held
her
hands
wide
apart
and
sun
woman
called
down
the
wrath
of
earthmaker
upon
him
and
with
the
same
knife
he
cut
her
throat
redbird
fell
to
her
knees
sobbing
oh
no
more
no
more
water
flows
fast
and
wild
grape
knelt
with
her
and
held
her
and
they
wept
together
redbird
cried
until
floating
lily
began
to
wail
redbird
gave
her
daughter
the
breast
and
a
warmth
spread
from
her
baby
sucking
lips
blunting
the
edge
of
grief
and
calming
her
a
little
wild
grape
said
i
have
seen
white
bear
redbird
body
went
rigid
floating
lily
pulled
her
mouth
away
from
redbird
breast
and
started
to
cry
again
white
bear
alive
wild
grape
nodded
when
the
long
knives
were
killing
us
at
the
bad
axe
he
came
he
was
the
long
knife
war
chief
prisoner
he
spoke
for
the
long
knife
chief
told
us
not
to
be
afraid
but
then
he
saw
sun
woman
lying
on
the
ground
with
her
throat
cut
he
fell
down
beside
her
and
screamed
and
tore
at
his
face
the
long
knives
had
to
hold
him
i
thought
they
might
kill
him
or
he
might
kill
himself
they
dragged
him
away
i
think
he
is
a
prisoner
right
there
in
that
fort
perhaps
he
is
redbird
thought
bitterly
everyone
in
miserable
silence
she
made
a
little
tent
out
of
her
blanket
in
the
field
by
the
fort
using
sticks
eagle
feather
found
for
her
she
and
her
children
huddled
under
the
blanket
the
sorrow
in
her
belly
like
a
wolf
inside
her
trying
to
gnaw
and
claw
its
way
out
the
thought
that
white
bear
might
be
on
the
other
side
of
those
walls
of
limestone
was
more
than
she
could
stand
she
could
not
move
or
speak
long
knives
stood
around
the
edges
of
the
field
watching
the
remnant
of
the
british
band
with
their
cold
pale
eyes
redbird
almost
wished
one
of
them
would
shoot
her
and
end
her
pain
but
then
what
would
her
children
do
she
did
not
want
eagle
feather
and
floating
lily
to
die
later
that
day
owl
carver
hobbled
over
to
her
followed
by
a
long
knife
with
a
rifle
my
daughter
he
looked
very
old
and
tired
it
was
a
miracle
that
he
had
lived
through
this
war
she
noticed
that
he
held
in
his
hand
the
medicine
bag
where
are
you
going
father
the
winnebago
prophet
black
hawk
and
i
must
go
into
the
fort
to
meet
the
pale
eyes
war
chiefs
i
guess
they
will
shoot
us
or
hang
us
i
can
not
see
the
future
anymore
wave
tells
me
that
the
rest
of
you
are
to
walk
south
to
the
rock
river
the
long
knives
will
keep
you
at
their
fort
there
till
next
spring
then
they
will
let
you
cross
the
river
to
join
he
who
moves
alertly
in
ioway
country
take
care
of
your
mother
and
your
sister
you
are
the
strongest
and
wisest
of
my
children
he
thrust
his
medicine
bag
at
her
if
i
bring
this
into
the
fort
it
may
be
lost
to
our
people
forever
you
are
my
child
you
must
be
the
spirit
walker
for
the
british
band
a
golden
glow
spread
through
her
body
she
took
the
bag
from
him
it
was
very
light
in
her
hands
and
held
it
against
her
chest
she
tried
to
speak
but
her
throat
closed
up
on
her
owl
carver
said
remember
always
all
people
even
the
pale
eyes
are
children
of
earthmaker
whatever
power
earthmaker
gives
you
never
use
it
against
another
person
if
the
long
knives
hurt
you
you
can
ask
for
strength
to
fight
them
yourself
but
never
call
on
the
spirits
to
attack
them
yes
father
if
they
have
killed
white
bear
i
will
not
use
the
power
of
the
spirits
against
farewell
my
child
redbird
took
owl
carver
hand
if
you
meet
white
bear
there
in
the
fort
tell
him
i
am
alive
and
eagle
feather
and
floating
lily
are
alive
and
one
day
we
will
all
be
together
wolf
paw
stood
beside
her
watching
black
hawk
the
winnebago
prophet
and
owl
carver
walk
into
the
square
of
buildings
they
were
followed
by
six
long
knives
pointing
rifles
at
them
and
by
a
delegation
of
winnebago
chiefs
and
braves
she
clutched
the
medicine
bag
tightly
her
eyes
clouded
over
she
saw
a
crowd
of
pale
eyes
with
distorted
mouths
shouting
terror
seized
her
and
she
tried
to
cry
aloud
but
she
could
not
the
white
faces
dissolved
and
she
saw
a
mound
of
earth
in
a
forest
atop
it
was
a
willow
wand
with
a
small
strip
of
red
blanket
tied
to
it
darkness
closed
in
around
her
she
felt
strong
hands
gripping
her
arms
her
sight
cleared
and
she
realized
that
wolf
paw
was
holding
her
you
were
falling
he
said
i
am
afraid
she
said
i
have
seen
death
on
the
trail
before
us
wolf
paw
looked
down
at
her
with
earnest
eyes
he
had
aged
so
much
he
had
untied
the
red
horsehair
crest
from
his
head
a
wise
thing
to
do
because
there
were
pale
eyes
who
might
recognize
him
as
a
leading
sauk
brave
and
want
revenge
he
now
had
only
a
short
irregular
growth
of
black
hair
on
the
middle
of
his
scalp
and
stubble
growing
around
it
but
he
still
wore
the
silver
coin
around
his
neck
he
said
whatever
we
must
face
you
have
more
courage
than
any
of
us
i
have
not
forgotten
many
winters
ago
when
the
spirit
bear
came
to
our
camp
i
turned
and
ran
while
you
stood
fast
she
waved
a
hand
it
was
only
white
bear
we
did
not
know
that
then
from
that
day
when
i
ran
and
you
stood
i
have
always
wished
that
a
child
of
mine
might
possess
your
courage
and
wisdom
she
remembered
how
he
had
pushed
her
aside
the
night
she
stood
beside
white
bear
and
warned
the
tribe
against
going
to
war
she
remembered
the
woman
dress
he
had
forced
on
white
bear
but
the
man
she
saw
before
her
was
lost
and
grieving
he
had
lost
his
war
he
had
let
his
wives
and
children
be
killed
he
had
failed
himself
he
had
nothing
left
to
believe
in
so
she
only
said
be
as
a
father
to
the
children
i
do
have
help
me
protect
them
the
sun
beat
down
on
her
bare
head
and
the
dust
of
the
trail
choked
her
this
was
the
moon
of
dry
rivers
the
hottest
time
of
summer
every
step
hurt
her
heart
because
every
step
took
her
farther
away
from
that
fort
where
the
long
knives
might
be
holding
white
bear
might
be
she
had
never
been
able
to
find
out
by
the
third
day
of
their
trek
southward
along
the
great
river
the
soles
of
redbird
moccasins
had
worn
through
she
stumbled
over
ruts
dug
in
the
wide
trail
by
pale
eyes
wagon
wheels
the
sun
had
baked
the
packed
dirt
of
the
trail
till
it
was
hard
as
stone
when
the
long
knives
let
them
stop
to
rest
at
midday
she
took
from
her
blanket
roll
white
bear
knife
with
the
knife
she
cut
strips
away
from
her
doeskin
dress
and
bound
them
around
her
feet
she
cut
up
eagle
feather
shirt
and
wrapped
his
moccasins
so
they
would
last
longer
a
long
knife
with
a
thick
blond
mustache
was
standing
over
her
with
his
hand
out
give
me
that
no
knives
he
spoke
the
pale
eyes
tongue
but
she
knew
enough
of
it
to
understand
but
she
could
give
up
the
knife
it
was
all
she
had
left
of
white
bear
her
grip
tightened
on
the
deerhorn
handle
and
she
thought
she
would
stab
the
long
knife
or
herself
before
she
would
let
go
of
it
she
tried
to
tell
him
that
this
was
precious
that
it
belonged
to
her
husband
who
was
a
shaman
but
she
did
not
have
the
american
words
to
say
that
he
just
kept
saying
no
knives
and
his
face
turned
a
deep
red
his
hand
rested
on
the
butt
of
his
pistol
wolf
paw
came
over
he
took
her
wrist
in
a
strong
grip
and
took
the
knife
from
her
hand
and
held
it
out
handle
first
to
the
she
understood
why
wolf
paw
had
forced
her
to
give
up
the
knife
but
she
was
angry
with
him
that
was
white
bear
knife
from
his
father
she
said
the
long
knife
would
have
killed
you
wolf
paw
said
we
can
not
fight
them
she
saw
the
hopelessness
in
his
eyes
and
she
put
her
hand
reassuringly
on
his
arm
when
the
long
knives
ordered
them
to
get
up
and
start
walking
he
walked
beside
her
she
was
hungry
all
day
long
a
food
wagon
followed
the
party
three
times
a
day
the
soldiers
got
meat
and
bread
from
it
but
the
sauk
got
only
corn
mash
on
tin
plates
which
they
washed
out
in
the
river
and
returned
to
the
food
wagon
several
times
a
day
they
were
allowed
to
stop
and
drink
from
the
river
redbird
prayed
that
her
milk
would
hold
out
for
floating
lily
she
sang
a
walking
song
to
try
to
forget
her
pain
and
to
help
her
put
one
aching
foot
in
front
of
the
other
we
walk
this
trail
following
the
deer
sing
as
you
walk
oh
braves
and
squaws
last
night
i
dreamed
my
moccasins
struck
fire
as
they
touched
the
ground
when
she
raised
her
voice
others
joined
in
after
a
while
even
wolf
paw
began
to
sing
in
a
deep
voice
five
long
knives
rode
before
the
sauk
and
another
five
behind
them
redbird
looked
around
at
her
people
a
hundred
or
so
mostly
women
and
children
the
men
numbered
about
twenty
tired
hungry
sick
broken
in
spirit
all
of
them
on
foot
now
the
last
of
their
horses
having
been
taken
away
at
fort
crawford
she
remembered
owl
carver
parting
words
to
her
must
be
the
spirit
walker
for
the
british
and
wolf
paw
had
said
that
she
had
the
courage
and
wisdom
to
face
death
on
the
trail
whatever
this
remnant
of
her
people
might
have
to
meet
now
she
promised
herself
that
she
would
use
all
her
strength
to
help
them
through
it
they
came
to
a
smaller
river
the
fever
that
flowed
into
the
great
river
a
flatboat
to
take
travelers
across
was
drawn
up
on
shore
the
long
knives
had
angry
words
with
the
men
who
would
pole
the
flatboat
redbird
understood
that
the
boatmen
would
not
carry
her
people
let
them
swim
their
gestures
said
but
the
river
was
too
deep
and
its
current
too
swift
for
these
exhausted
people
while
the
long
knives
argued
with
the
boatmen
more
pale
eyes
came
to
watch
they
must
have
a
town
nearby
redbird
felt
a
chill
of
fear
at
the
hatred
she
saw
in
their
faces
how
frightened
of
the
british
band
they
must
have
been
only
a
moon
or
two
ago
now
they
had
what
was
left
of
the
british
band
at
their
mercy
the
long
knife
leader
shouted
and
drew
his
pistol
and
waved
it
shaking
his
head
the
chief
of
the
boatmen
made
an
angry
gesture
toward
the
flatboat
the
long
knife
took
coins
from
his
saddlebag
and
handed
them
down
to
the
boatman
the
long
knives
began
to
herd
redbird
people
on
board
it
took
three
trips
to
carry
all
of
the
sauk
across
the
fever
river
by
this
time
hundreds
of
pale
eyes
men
women
and
children
had
gathered
at
the
riverbank
redbird
and
her
children
were
in
the
last
group
to
cross
she
heard
angry
cries
the
pale
eyes
were
throwing
rotten
vegetables
clumps
of
dirt
and
small
rocks
she
pulled
floating
lily
around
from
her
back
to
hold
her
in
her
arms
a
soft
tomato
hit
redbird
in
the
ear
she
heard
laughter
she
wanted
to
keep
both
hands
on
the
baby
so
she
did
not
wipe
away
the
pulp
and
seeds
that
dripped
down
her
neck
she
ran
on
board
the
boat
when
she
stumbled
off
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
she
was
panting
breathless
with
relief
she
felt
a
hand
wiping
the
tomato
pulp
from
her
neck
wolf
paw
it
was
good
to
know
he
was
nearby
the
next
morning
when
they
set
out
wolf
paw
picked
up
eagle
feather
whose
ragged
moccasins
had
fallen
from
his
feet
he
lifted
him
over
his
head
and
set
him
on
his
shoulders
redbird
smiled
her
thanks
and
wolf
paw
returned
a
sad
look
then
sighed
and
lowered
his
gaze
to
the
ground
all
that
day
he
trudged
beside
her
with
eagle
feather
on
his
back
that
night
he
slept
near
redbird
and
her
children
the
following
day
the
trail
led
past
flat
fields
mostly
planted
with
corn
stretching
to
the
edge
of
the
great
river
for
a
moment
reminded
of
the
cornfields
around
saukenuk
redbird
heart
lifted
then
she
recalled
that
from
now
on
only
pale
eyes
would
plant
corn
in
this
country
on
her
left
bluffs
rose
up
overlooking
the
river
like
the
statues
of
spirits
ahead
she
could
see
many
pale
eyes
lodges
built
on
the
side
of
a
hill
at
the
top
of
the
hill
was
a
fort
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
upright
logs
she
saw
a
dark
mass
of
people
spread
across
the
trail
ahead
they
were
not
standing
to
one
side
as
those
at
the
last
town
had
they
were
blocking
the
way
she
felt
that
she
knew
this
place
though
she
had
never
been
here
before
after
a
moment
she
understood
why
white
bear
and
yellow
hair
had
both
talked
to
her
many
times
about
the
village
where
white
bear
had
lived
with
his
father
star
arrow
the
great
lodge
they
lived
in
must
be
somewhere
beyond
that
hill
and
the
walled
building
at
the
top
of
the
hill
would
be
the
trading
post
of
white
bear
uncle
the
one
who
had
driven
him
away
from
here
and
who
had
tried
to
kill
him
at
old
creek
as
she
got
closer
she
heard
angry
voices
again
she
took
her
baby
in
her
arms
she
looked
around
for
wolf
paw
and
was
grateful
to
see
him
at
her
side
he
set
eagle
feather
down
and
the
boy
seized
her
skirt
but
if
this
was
the
town
where
white
bear
had
lived
this
was
where
wolf
paw
war
party
had
killed
many
men
women
and
children
this
was
where
the
big
gun
had
fired
into
wolf
paw
body
the
silver
coin
that
still
hung
around
his
neck
what
if
these
people
recognized
him
she
was
glad
again
that
he
had
taken
off
his
red
crest
the
coin
she
noticed
had
disappeared
too
inside
his
buckskin
shirt
but
whether
they
recognized
wolf
paw
or
not
these
people
would
hate
her
people
terror
seized
her
as
she
remembered
her
vision
at
fort
crawford
death
on
the
trail
she
tried
to
stop
walking
but
the
people
behind
her
pushed
her
on
the
mounted
long
knives
behind
them
were
driving
everyone
forward
closer
to
the
pale
eyes
standing
in
the
trail
she
saw
that
most
of
those
in
front
were
men
and
they
were
holding
clubs
and
rocks
her
legs
turned
to
water
and
she
felt
that
she
might
fall
down
she
did
not
have
the
strength
to
go
on
to
walk
toward
the
death
she
had
foreseen
days
ago
her
own
people
jostled
her
the
long
knives
were
calling
orders
trying
to
make
the
sauk
move
ahead
but
nobody
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
come
near
that
angry
crowd
the
long
knife
with
the
yellow
mustache
rode
ahead
and
spoke
to
the
crowd
waving
his
hand
at
them
to
clear
the
way
they
shouted
back
at
him
the
crowd
surged
forward
and
the
rode
into
the
fields
on
either
side
of
the
trail
she
could
not
see
the
villagers
because
wolf
paw
had
stepped
in
front
of
her
eagle
feather
frantic
grip
was
hurting
her
leg
she
hugged
floating
lily
tightly
in
her
arms
hoping
that
if
she
were
felled
by
a
stone
her
body
would
protect
her
baby
are
going
to
kill
all
of
the
shouts
of
the
pale
eyes
battered
at
her
ears
rocks
many
bigger
than
a
man
fist
hurtled
through
the
air
redbird
saw
women
and
children
falling
around
her
she
heard
a
thud
that
made
her
ears
ring
and
suddenly
wolf
paw
was
slumping
to
the
rutted
trail
in
front
of
her
men
charged
at
the
fallen
wolf
paw
with
rocks
and
clubs
raised
eagle
feather
suddenly
let
go
of
redbird
and
plunged
into
the
crowd
of
sauk
behind
her
she
watched
him
disappear
as
he
burrowed
in
among
the
legs
of
the
women
and
men
redbird
squeezing
floating
lily
against
her
chest
redbird
looked
around
frantically
at
the
sound
of
her
name
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
she
saw
yellow
braids
and
blue
eyes
and
arms
waving
yellow
hair
her
face
twisted
with
anguish
was
trying
to
force
her
way
through
to
her
there
were
other
people
with
yellow
hair
a
very
stout
woman
was
pushing
and
pulling
at
the
angry
men
and
women
around
her
shouting
at
them
to
stop
what
they
were
doing
and
a
man
with
sandy
hair
was
also
fighting
the
other
villagers
bear
had
an
aunt
and
uncle
in
this
but
the
crowd
pushed
forward
and
she
could
no
longer
see
those
few
who
were
trying
to
help
her
people
the
men
were
beating
wolf
paw
one
man
with
broad
shoulders
and
chest
and
a
thick
brown
beard
lifted
a
club
to
bring
it
down
on
wolf
paw
head
in
the
pale
eyes
tongue
redbird
cried
out
no
please
the
man
turned
and
stared
at
her
madness
in
his
eyes
you
kill
my
wife
he
roared
his
spittle
wet
her
face
he
reached
for
her
she
screamed
and
screamed
his
hand
grabbed
at
floating
lily
tiny
body
and
the
baby
shrieked
with
pain
and
terror
redbird
tried
to
bite
and
kick
him
to
squirm
away
he
swung
his
club
at
her
and
hit
the
side
of
her
head
the
blow
stunned
her
weakening
her
grip
on
her
baby
the
man
wrenched
floating
lily
from
her
arms
her
screams
tore
her
throat
the
man
whirled
away
from
her
lifted
floating
lily
high
over
his
head
the
crowd
enveloped
him
and
the
baby
disappeared
in
their
midst
screaming
punching
and
kicking
she
fought
to
get
at
floating
lily
but
people
pushed
her
back
and
threw
her
to
the
ground
her
voice
was
gone
she
crawled
through
the
stones
and
the
dirt
she
saw
the
legs
of
pale
eyes
men
and
the
skirts
of
pale
eyes
women
and
in
their
midst
a
small
unmoving
body
wrapped
in
a
blanket
soaked
with
blood
the
people
rushed
off
in
a
different
direction
and
she
crawled
along
the
trail
until
she
could
reach
out
and
take
her
daughter
in
her
arms
she
pulled
herself
into
a
sitting
position
holding
the
bundle
in
her
lap
her
hands
were
wet
with
blood
she
looked
down
at
the
tiny
crumpled
face
blood
running
out
of
the
baby
mouth
no
movement
arms
and
legs
limp
no
sound
no
breath
her
mind
went
blank
a
mantle
of
blackness
covered
her
eyes
when
she
came
awake
yellow
hair
was
sitting
beside
her
holding
her
in
her
arms
and
sobbing
the
fat
pale
eyes
woman
was
standing
over
both
of
them
tears
streaking
her
face
she
was
holding
a
red
blanket
in
her
hands
offering
it
to
redbird
at
the
sight
of
the
strange
white
face
redbird
screamed
and
shrank
away
pressing
the
baby
in
her
arms
to
her
breast
she
pulled
away
from
yellow
hair
who
sat
on
the
ground
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
the
fat
woman
put
the
blanket
on
the
ground
and
stumbled
away
from
redbird
she
got
a
short
distance
and
began
to
throw
up
coughing
and
sobbing
the
man
went
to
her
and
held
her
redbird
watched
the
anguish
of
yellow
hair
and
the
fat
woman
numbly
she
hurt
too
much
to
have
any
feeling
for
anyone
else
she
understood
that
the
woman
had
given
her
the
blanket
to
wrap
floating
lily
she
hitched
herself
over
to
the
blanket
and
picked
it
up
and
wrapped
it
around
the
bloody
bundle
without
looking
at
it
the
bright
red
of
the
blanket
she
thought
would
keep
floating
lily
warm
from
some
distance
away
the
anguished
cries
of
other
people
reached
redbird
ears
others
must
have
been
hurt
by
the
pale
eyes
villagers
yellow
hair
still
crying
so
hard
she
was
unable
to
speak
moved
beside
redbird
and
put
her
hand
on
the
blanket
the
crowd
that
had
attacked
the
sauk
were
gathered
in
a
field
beside
the
trail
the
ten
long
knives
on
horseback
had
formed
a
line
and
had
pushed
them
back
too
late
the
fat
woman
seemed
to
have
forgotten
redbird
she
staggered
away
from
the
sauk
screaming
at
the
people
in
the
field
it
was
impossible
for
redbird
to
understand
her
words
but
her
voice
was
full
of
rage
some
of
the
people
answered
back
but
in
sullen
voices
redbird
could
hardly
hear
redbird
could
not
stand
up
she
felt
no
strength
at
all
in
her
trembling
legs
eagle
feather
she
cried
she
called
her
son
again
and
again
he
came
and
stood
before
her
is
floating
lily
dead
did
they
kill
her
yes
said
redbird
eagle
feather
began
to
cry
why
did
they
kill
my
little
sister
redbird
felt
a
touch
on
her
shoulder
wolf
paw
hand
his
forehead
was
gashed
and
blood
was
running
down
into
one
eye
that
was
swollen
and
shut
i
thought
they
killed
you
she
said
it
would
have
been
good
if
they
had
no
she
said
do
not
wish
that
redbird
sensed
a
silence
and
realized
that
yellow
hair
was
no
longer
crying
she
and
wolf
paw
were
staring
at
each
other
now
thought
redbird
yellow
hair
could
have
her
revenge
for
her
father
death
for
her
own
suffering
all
she
had
to
do
was
tell
the
villagers
who
wolf
paw
was
the
leader
of
the
war
band
that
had
attacked
victor
the
brave
who
had
kidnapped
her
the
long
knives
could
not
would
not
stop
the
people
from
killing
him
on
the
spot
yellow
hair
sighed
and
put
her
arm
around
redbird
shoulders
perhaps
she
did
want
revenge
redbird
was
too
sick
with
grief
to
wonder
much
about
it
wolf
paw
said
four
others
are
dead
and
many
more
are
hurt
we
will
carry
our
dead
away
from
this
place
i
think
the
long
knives
will
let
us
bury
them
farther
along
this
trail
holding
floating
lily
body
tightly
redbird
let
wolf
paw
take
her
by
the
elbows
and
lift
her
to
her
feet
she
felt
yellow
hair
arm
still
around
her
shoulders
she
began
to
cry
quietly
wolf
paw
said
even
though
you
grieve
for
your
baby
the
people
who
are
wounded
need
your
help
sun
woman
taught
you
and
you
were
white
wife
and
owl
carver
daughter
you
are
the
only
one
who
knows
what
to
do
i
have
hardly
any
medicines
left
she
said
you
can
pray
for
those
who
are
hurt
wolf
paw
said
and
when
we
bury
the
dead
you
can
speak
to
their
spirits
for
us
must
be
the
spirit
walker
for
the
british
a
long
knife
rode
over
and
spoke
to
yellow
hair
redbird
understood
that
he
was
telling
her
that
she
could
not
stay
with
the
sauk
prisoners
in
the
way
they
had
learned
to
talk
to
each
other
yellow
hair
told
redbird
that
she
would
have
gladly
died
to
save
floating
lily
she
promised
to
do
what
she
could
for
the
remaining
people
you
me
sisters
redbird
said
yellow
hair
put
her
arms
around
redbird
pressing
floating
lily
between
them
she
bent
and
kissed
redbird
on
the
cheek
her
tears
wetting
redbird
face
redbird
glanced
up
at
the
long
knife
who
had
spoken
to
yellow
hair
his
mouth
under
his
yellow
mustache
twisted
in
scorn
yellow
hair
began
to
sob
again
and
her
arms
tightened
around
redbird
redbird
felt
white
bear
aunt
and
uncle
gently
trying
to
pull
yellow
hair
away
from
her
the
mounted
long
knife
shouted
angrily
would
they
shoot
yellow
hair
if
she
did
leave
frightened
for
yellow
hair
redbird
twisted
her
arms
and
shoulders
and
broke
free
from
her
the
fat
woman
and
the
man
drew
yellow
hair
away
but
her
sobs
became
louder
turned
to
screams
my
baby
redbird
knew
those
pale
eyes
words
and
it
was
true
she
thought
had
not
yellow
hair
been
in
the
birthing
wickiup
with
redbird
had
she
not
been
present
for
every
instant
of
floating
lily
early
life
was
she
not
also
white
bear
wife
feels
the
same
pain
i
yellow
hair
screams
died
away
as
white
bear
aunt
and
uncle
half
carried
her
away
from
the
trail
her
cries
were
drowned
out
by
the
shouts
of
the
long
knives
ordering
the
sauk
to
get
to
their
feet
and
start
walking
again
as
redbird
holding
floating
lily
stumbled
down
the
trail
she
looked
at
the
crowd
in
the
field
they
were
not
shouting
or
throwing
rocks
now
they
just
stared
perhaps
they
were
satisfied
her
eyes
met
those
of
the
man
who
had
torn
floating
lily
from
her
arms
he
saw
her
holding
her
dead
daughter
and
his
face
was
still
red
and
rigid
with
hatred
she
had
understood
enough
of
his
tongue
to
understand
what
he
had
shouted
at
her
kill
my
at
the
sight
of
him
she
felt
heavy
as
a
stone
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
that
would
bring
floating
lily
back
her
baby
little
feet
were
on
the
trail
of
souls
only
death
would
free
redbird
from
pain
wolf
paw
once
again
carrying
eagle
feather
walked
beside
her
she
sensed
someone
walking
on
her
other
side
and
turned
to
look
she
saw
a
shrunken
wizened
woman
with
a
sad
face
it
took
her
a
moment
to
realize
that
it
was
her
mother
wind
bends
grass
many
footsteps
later
when
their
trail
passed
through
woods
the
long
knives
let
them
stop
they
unstrapped
small
shovels
from
their
saddles
and
gave
them
to
some
of
the
men
the
sauk
men
dug
five
deep
graves
and
placed
the
bodies
three
women
one
man
and
a
baby
sitting
upright
in
them
wolf
paw
dug
floating
lily
grave
letting
eagle
feather
do
part
of
the
work
before
covering
floating
lily
with
earth
redbird
tore
a
small
strip
from
the
red
blanket
the
fat
woman
had
given
her
and
set
it
beside
the
grave
when
the
five
were
buried
redbird
saw
the
eyes
of
all
the
people
turned
toward
her
and
she
knew
they
expected
her
in
spite
of
the
grief
that
was
killing
her
to
complete
the
rite
first
she
sang
in
your
brown
blanket
o
earthmaker
wrap
your
children
and
carry
them
away
fold
them
again
in
your
body
when
she
had
finished
the
song
she
spoke
to
the
dead
you
are
innocent
of
wrongdoing
she
said
you
have
no
debt
to
pay
no
promise
to
keep
you
have
kept
faith
and
walked
with
honor
the
path
that
led
to
these
graves
do
not
linger
here
in
hope
of
avenging
yourselves
on
those
who
killed
you
great
happiness
awaits
you
in
the
west
the
owl
spirit
will
show
you
how
to
set
your
feet
on
the
trail
of
souls
go
now
begin
your
journey
after
she
had
spoken
the
people
broke
willow
wands
from
trees
growing
by
the
water
and
set
them
upright
on
the
mounds
of
earth
redbird
took
the
piece
of
red
blanket
and
tied
it
to
the
end
of
the
wand
over
floating
lily
grave
path
on
this
earth
was
a
short
one
my
daughter
but
the
earth
is
not
a
good
place
for
our
people
just
now
and
many
many
of
your
sauk
brothers
and
sisters
will
journey
with
you
on
the
trail
of
souls
go
now
into
the
west
and
your
father
and
brother
and
i
will
one
day
follow
after
and
we
will
all
be
together
as
she
stepped
back
from
the
grave
she
remembered
how
two
days
ago
far
to
the
north
she
had
seen
this
grave
in
her
mind
and
had
fainted
with
a
sinking
heart
she
understood
how
terrible
were
the
shaman
gifts
she
had
longed
for
all
her
life
the
long
knives
had
sat
silently
beside
the
trail
letting
their
horses
graze
while
the
people
buried
their
dead
they
did
not
seem
worried
that
anyone
might
try
to
escape
after
all
where
could
a
sauk
go
in
this
country
once
they
might
have
walked
freely
anywhere
this
side
of
the
great
river
now
all
who
lived
in
this
land
hated
them
redbird
could
not
tell
whether
the
long
knives
were
ashamed
that
they
let
these
people
in
their
care
be
killed
maybe
they
were
pleased
maybe
it
did
not
matter
to
them
when
the
people
came
out
of
the
woods
the
long
knives
stood
up
silent
and
expressionless
and
mounted
their
horses
again
for
the
journey
south
wolf
paw
walked
beside
redbird
and
eagle
feather
redbird
missed
the
familiar
weight
of
the
baby
on
her
back
and
started
to
weep
again
her
breasts
filling
with
milk
that
would
not
be
sucked
began
to
ache
after
they
had
walked
a
long
time
in
silence
wolf
paw
said
i
failed
you
redbird
you
asked
me
to
protect
your
children
i
sent
my
own
wives
and
my
children
to
their
deaths
and
now
i
did
not
save
your
daughter
i
am
not
a
man
the
pale
eyes
had
not
killed
wolf
paw
redbird
thought
but
they
had
killed
his
spirit
she
would
try
to
heal
him
nothing
would
bring
back
floating
lily
but
perhaps
she
could
give
new
life
to
this
man
when
they
stopped
to
sleep
that
night
she
lay
on
her
back
on
the
ground
staring
up
at
the
sky
eagle
feather
snuggled
close
to
her
wolf
paw
and
wind
bends
grass
nearby
a
bird
appeared
on
a
tree
limb
overhead
even
though
it
was
night
she
could
somehow
see
that
the
bird
plumage
was
a
red
as
bright
as
the
strip
of
blanket
she
had
left
on
floating
lily
grave
around
his
eyes
was
a
black
mask
and
on
his
head
a
crest
of
red
feathers
the
bird
flew
to
a
more
distant
tree
limb
and
she
felt
that
he
called
her
to
follow
him
she
stood
up
and
none
of
the
sleeping
people
noticed
her
she
walked
past
a
long
knife
on
guard
with
a
rifle
and
he
looked
right
through
her
the
bright
bird
darted
into
a
black
opening
in
the
hillside
above
the
river
and
redbird
followed
in
the
cave
all
she
could
see
was
the
glow
of
red
wings
far
ahead
of
her
there
were
many
twists
and
turns
and
she
went
down
very
far
she
began
to
see
light
ahead
it
appeared
so
gradually
that
her
eyes
adjusted
to
it
easily
and
when
she
came
to
a
chamber
that
was
brightly
lit
she
was
neither
dazzled
nor
blinded
the
walls
of
the
chamber
rose
high
above
her
hard
and
smooth
and
clear
as
ice
and
they
glistened
with
a
light
that
seemed
to
be
everywhere
behind
them
she
heard
a
murmuring
and
a
rustling
and
saw
in
niches
cut
into
the
wall
many
kinds
of
creatures
plants
and
animals
and
birds
she
looked
down
at
fish
swimming
restlessly
in
the
dark
pool
that
formed
most
of
the
floor
in
the
center
of
the
pool
was
an
island
and
on
the
island
a
huge
ancient
turtle
squatted
on
four
wrinkled
legs
said
the
turtle
renegade
raoul
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
in
fort
crawford
assembly
room
waiting
for
the
guards
to
bring
in
auguste
in
a
row
beside
him
sat
seven
other
militia
officers
all
of
whom
had
been
witnesses
against
the
indian
leaders
raoul
discovered
all
at
once
that
he
was
trembling
with
anticipation
today
be
the
it
was
almost
a
prayer
but
he
did
not
know
who
would
hear
such
a
prayer
them
string
him
up
me
see
that
damned
mongrel
today
the
commanders
of
the
army
that
had
defeated
black
hawk
would
tell
the
sauk
and
fox
leaders
their
fate
the
less
important
indians
were
to
be
dealt
with
first
so
auguste
would
be
coming
in
now
raoul
watched
avidly
as
auguste
walked
in
between
two
privates
his
wrists
handcuffed
carrying
an
iron
ball
at
the
end
of
a
chain
attached
to
his
ankles
the
sight
of
the
mongrel
in
chains
was
more
satisfying
than
a
good
swig
of
old
kaintuck
raoul
had
not
seen
auguste
since
the
day
they
had
faced
each
other
too
briefly
on
that
bloody
island
off
the
mouth
of
the
bad
axe
again
raoul
saw
that
auguste
right
ear
partly
covered
by
his
long
black
locks
was
split
into
upper
and
lower
halves
with
a
red
partly
healed
gap
between
them
bullet
must
have
gone
through
his
ear
instead
of
his
head
and
knowing
eli
that
was
no
accident
that
was
why
he
said
i
find
a
surprise
up
in
michigan
raoul
fingers
worked
in
his
lap
that
old
bastard
had
deliberately
lied
to
him
about
killing
auguste
why
what
could
he
gain
by
keeping
auguste
alive
auguste
dark
eyes
widened
as
they
met
raoul
and
from
across
the
room
his
hatred
struck
raoul
like
a
blow
raoul
remembered
the
woman
whose
throat
he
had
cut
mother
but
killing
her
was
still
not
enough
to
pay
me
back
for
clarissa
and
phil
and
andy
for
the
burning
of
auguste
turned
his
back
to
raoul
and
faced
the
three
commanders
who
sat
at
a
long
table
behind
which
a
big
american
flag
was
nailed
to
the
plaster
wall
in
the
center
was
major
general
winfield
scott
finally
arrived
from
the
east
to
take
charge
of
what
was
left
of
the
war
raoul
hoped
scott
had
come
out
here
with
president
jackson
orders
to
send
this
pack
of
savages
to
the
gallows
the
general
had
listened
intently
to
everything
raoul
had
to
say
against
the
mongrel
raoul
distrusted
scott
fancy
uniform
his
heavy
epaulets
and
the
white
plume
on
the
cocked
hat
that
lay
beside
him
but
scott
features
were
severe
his
brows
straight
and
black
his
nose
sharp
and
his
mouth
tight
raoul
saw
no
pity
in
the
look
he
bent
on
auguste
flanking
scott
were
colonel
zachary
taylor
and
brigadier
general
henry
atkinson
who
had
commanded
the
militia
and
troops
right
up
to
the
battle
at
the
bad
axe
winfield
scott
glanced
at
a
paper
before
him
and
said
auguste
de
marion
by
some
also
called
white
bear
you
are
named
in
colonel
taylor
report
as
one
of
the
ringleaders
of
black
hawk
uprising
we
have
heard
testimony
that
you
are
a
renegade
and
murderer
auguste
glanced
at
raoul
and
then
said
have
i
the
right
to
hear
what
has
been
said
against
me
scott
shook
his
head
this
is
only
a
hearing
not
a
what
do
you
have
to
say
for
yourself
i
advised
my
people
to
keep
the
peace
auguste
said
and
the
british
band
did
not
take
my
advice
so
i
am
not
much
of
a
ringleader
and
i
never
killed
anyone
so
i
am
no
murderer
as
for
being
a
renegade
i
was
born
a
sauk
i
no
more
a
renegade
than
any
other
member
of
my
tribe
who
followed
black
hawk
auguste
voice
rang
loud
and
clear
raoul
noticed
that
his
speech
seemed
more
accented
than
he
remembered
it
probably
from
living
with
indians
and
talking
only
their
talk
for
nearly
a
year
it
only
a
year
since
i
drove
him
from
victoire
seems
a
whole
lifetime
scott
cast
sideways
glances
at
taylor
and
atkinson
we
are
told
you
are
an
american
citizen
said
zachary
taylor
auguste
said
sir
my
father
was
pierre
de
marion
an
american
citizen
and
because
it
was
his
wish
i
lived
as
a
white
man
for
six
years
but
my
mother
was
sun
woman
of
the
sauk
tribe
and
i
remained
a
sauk
in
my
heart
scott
said
your
heart
does
matter
to
the
law
what
was
your
conduct
during
the
war
raoul
listened
blood
hammering
in
his
skull
to
auguste
account
of
old
man
creek
auguste
named
him
turned
and
pointed
to
him
then
he
came
toward
me
to
shoot
me
i
ran
into
the
tall
grass
eli
greenglove
one
of
his
men
shot
me
he
touched
his
mangled
ear
it
was
dark
and
the
men
were
drunk
and
i
was
able
to
stay
alive
by
pretending
to
be
dead
when
black
hawk
found
out
that
his
emissaries
had
been
shot
he
believed
he
had
no
choice
but
to
go
on
fighting
it
was
only
then
that
the
british
band
began
to
attack
whites
anger
drove
raoul
to
his
feet
sir
i
must
answer
that
scott
turned
hard
blue
eyes
on
raoul
that
wo
be
necessary
colonel
i
already
had
a
complete
report
of
what
happened
at
old
man
creek
raoul
heard
a
faint
disdain
in
scott
elegant
virginia
drawl
and
felt
his
face
turn
hot
scott
consulted
in
a
murmur
with
taylor
and
atkinson
raoul
sat
down
slowly
and
drummed
his
fingers
on
his
knee
he
looked
up
to
see
auguste
staring
stonily
at
him
his
manacled
hands
clenched
into
fists
raoul
made
himself
hold
auguste
gaze
i
wonder
if
he
does
have
any
power
to
hurt
what
is
he
thinking
what
is
he
planning
scott
said
we
read
depositions
from
miss
hale
and
the
boy
woodrow
prewitt
stating
that
auguste
and
his
squaw
protected
them
and
cared
for
them
while
they
were
captives
of
the
sauk
and
that
auguste
eventually
led
them
to
safety
raoul
clenched
his
jaw
and
his
breath
steamed
out
of
his
nostrils
he
wished
he
could
give
nancy
hale
the
back
of
his
hand
across
her
face
the
redskins
had
murdered
her
father
they
kidnapped
her
probably
they
raped
her
though
she
never
admit
it
how
in
hell
could
she
defend
this
mongrel
scott
said
it
seems
to
me
we
have
no
evidence
that
this
man
did
any
harm
to
the
united
states
or
to
any
of
our
citizens
however
there
are
serious
accusations
against
him
such
as
the
charge
that
he
instigated
the
sauk
raid
on
victor
if
he
is
not
legally
an
indian
which
this
board
of
inquiry
is
not
competent
to
determine
then
any
acts
of
war
he
participated
in
were
crimes
against
the
people
of
illinois
his
guilt
or
innocence
must
then
be
a
matter
for
a
civilian
court
to
decide
and
the
appropriate
place
would
be
the
county
where
he
lived
with
his
father
where
there
would
be
records
and
witnesses
raoul
could
hardly
hold
himself
back
from
jumping
up
and
shouting
in
triumph
he
forced
himself
to
look
anywhere
but
at
auguste
knowing
that
what
he
felt
would
be
all
too
easy
for
the
others
to
read
you
may
as
well
hang
me
yourself
general
auguste
said
quietly
pointing
at
raoul
runs
that
whole
county
no
witnesses
will
dare
to
come
forward
for
me
and
he
had
all
my
records
destroyed
without
records
nothing
can
be
proved
you
said
scott
raoul
felt
a
hollow
open
in
his
stomach
what
the
hell
had
burke
russell
done
with
auguste
adoption
records
and
pierre
will
the
damned
indians
had
killed
russell
and
that
pretty
wife
of
his
just
refused
to
speak
to
raoul
auguste
said
but
sir
i
do
believe
there
even
a
court
in
smith
county
to
try
me
zachary
taylor
shuffled
some
papers
yes
there
is
smith
county
had
a
special
election
a
month
after
that
bad
indian
raid
elected
county
commissioners
and
a
man
named
cooper
is
judge
of
the
circuit
court
i
think
we
can
guarantee
white
bear
or
auguste
de
marion
a
proper
trial
raoul
clenched
his
fists
things
had
gone
sour
in
smith
county
while
he
was
off
fighting
the
sauk
general
atkinson
said
i
do
know
about
that
seventeen
men
women
and
children
were
killed
in
that
raid
sending
this
man
to
stand
trial
there
could
be
simply
condemning
him
to
death
by
lynch
law
wish
it
could
be
that
remembering
the
cool
reception
gotten
in
victor
when
he
went
there
to
outfit
the
for
the
war
raoul
began
to
have
second
thoughts
about
whether
things
would
go
his
way
have
to
get
my
smith
county
boys
together
and
make
sure
cooper
runs
that
trial
raoul
stole
a
glance
at
auguste
and
saw
that
his
face
was
set
in
that
hard
expressionless
mold
indians
took
on
when
they
did
want
to
show
what
they
were
feeling
scott
said
send
a
good
officer
and
a
couple
of
men
to
victor
to
escort
this
man
and
insure
a
fair
trial
right
sir
said
zachary
taylor
making
a
note
lieutenant
jefferson
davis
and
two
enlisted
men
will
go
along
with
him
taylor
had
jumped
at
the
chance
to
send
lieutenant
davis
away
from
the
fort
raoul
thought
with
annoyance
the
gossip
around
fort
crawford
was
that
davis
was
courting
taylor
pretty
daughter
and
taylor
did
approve
scott
turned
his
gaze
on
raoul
and
you
colonel
de
marion
by
all
accounts
you
a
very
prominent
citizen
in
that
community
it
obvious
there
bad
blood
between
you
and
your
nephew
i
hold
you
responsible
if
there
any
violence
against
him
understood
sir
said
raoul
calmly
enough
but
hating
to
hear
the
mongrel
called
his
nephew
scott
threat
was
empty
once
the
general
was
back
east
he
would
care
about
the
fate
of
one
out
on
the
frontier
scott
turned
to
auguste
with
a
small
smile
while
you
are
on
trial
i
be
negotiating
a
treaty
with
the
sauk
and
after
that
if
they
do
hang
you
i
think
president
jackson
would
be
most
interested
in
meeting
you
a
treaty
a
meeting
with
jackson
raoul
quivered
with
anger
and
could
barely
keep
himself
from
letting
out
a
shout
did
that
mean
scott
going
to
hang
black
hawk
and
the
rest
of
them
was
he
taking
the
sauk
leaders
to
meet
the
president
if
he
does
the
mongrel
wo
be
with
raoul
thought
comforting
himself
with
the
picture
of
a
hempen
rope
around
neck
baby
auguste
felt
as
heavy
as
if
he
had
turned
to
stone
he
sat
hunched
over
on
the
plank
bed
covered
with
a
mattress
in
his
cell
in
victor
village
hall
clutching
his
stomach
as
tears
ran
from
his
eyes
after
what
frank
hopkins
had
just
told
him
he
no
longer
cared
what
happened
to
him
here
in
victor
these
people
had
killed
floating
lily
let
them
kill
him
too
he
did
not
want
to
live
in
a
world
that
had
killed
his
baby
daughter
he
felt
a
comforting
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
glanced
at
it
and
saw
frank
fingers
pressing
into
the
blue
calico
shirt
his
captors
at
fort
crawford
had
given
him
he
looked
up
to
see
lawyer
thomas
ford
sad
eyes
on
him
but
kindly
gestures
and
looks
meant
nothing
to
him
now
how
could
people
tear
a
baby
girl
from
her
mother
arms
and
beat
her
to
death
the
sauk
war
parties
killed
children
too
all
people
are
cruel
white
and
i
would
be
better
off
on
the
trail
of
souls
he
said
in
a
low
voice
mother
and
my
daughter
sun
woman
and
floating
lily
both
nancy
and
nicole
and
i
tried
to
stop
them
frank
said
his
eyes
moist
but
the
crowd
was
too
big
we
could
get
through
until
it
was
too
late
nancy
told
us
the
baby
was
your
daughter
nicole
and
nancy
tried
as
best
they
could
to
comfort
your
wife
for
all
he
knew
redbird
might
think
him
dead
he
had
asked
his
guards
at
fort
crawford
to
pass
word
to
her
that
he
was
alive
but
he
had
no
idea
whether
any
of
his
messages
had
reached
her
ford
the
lawyer
from
vandalia
frank
had
hired
to
defend
auguste
said
what
happened
shows
how
angry
the
people
of
victor
still
are
against
the
sauk
i
still
think
we
have
to
ask
for
a
change
of
venue
ford
was
a
short
slender
man
with
a
round
face
and
bright
intelligent
eyes
leaning
against
the
log
wall
of
auguste
cell
he
wore
a
dark
brown
frock
coat
with
a
high
collar
that
came
up
to
his
ears
frank
said
many
people
here
feel
terribly
sorry
for
auguste
and
a
lot
of
us
decided
after
we
survived
the
siege
that
we
would
put
up
anymore
with
the
lawlessness
that
raoul
and
his
crew
represent
raoul
is
back
auguste
thought
start
to
take
control
ford
said
well
auguste
ought
to
tell
us
what
he
thinks
it
his
neck
auguste
took
a
deep
breath
the
clean
smell
of
wood
filled
his
nostrils
a
good
smell
but
it
reminded
him
that
this
village
hall
was
only
recently
rebuilt
that
last
june
wolf
paw
raiding
party
had
burned
down
everything
in
victor
except
raoul
trading
post
how
could
he
possibly
get
a
fair
trial
here
auguste
said
at
least
here
i
have
some
people
who
know
me
and
care
about
me
ford
sighed
so
be
it
frank
i
want
a
list
of
every
man
who
was
in
the
mob
that
attacked
the
sauk
prisoners
we
do
want
any
of
them
sitting
on
the
jury
as
frank
and
ford
discussed
trial
tactics
auguste
gazed
around
at
this
dark
little
chamber
on
the
second
floor
of
the
village
hall
it
might
be
his
last
home
on
earth
the
only
window
was
a
square
barred
hole
high
up
on
the
south
wall
too
small
to
let
much
light
in
or
for
a
man
to
climb
out
through
this
morning
a
light
rain
falling
outside
spattered
through
the
window
and
the
cell
felt
damp
and
cool
frank
built
this
cell
he
could
never
have
thought
his
own
nephew
would
be
a
prisoner
in
we
have
a
power
of
work
to
do
auguste
ford
interrupted
his
thoughts
so
far
i
ca
find
anyone
who
confirms
your
story
of
what
happened
at
old
man
creek
this
otto
wegner
fellow
whose
life
you
saved
he
and
his
family
have
moved
down
to
the
texas
country
in
mexico
frank
said
we
do
have
two
people
who
testify
that
you
protected
them
and
never
went
on
any
war
parties
while
they
were
prisoners
of
the
british
band
miss
hale
and
the
boy
woodrow
at
the
mention
of
nancy
name
auguste
felt
a
wrench
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
she
had
stayed
in
victor
teaching
in
a
new
schoolhouse
frank
had
built
for
her
on
the
site
of
her
father
church
her
absence
in
the
week
he
had
been
here
had
hurt
him
deeply
frank
he
said
why
has
nancy
come
to
see
me
thomas
ford
said
miss
hale
is
a
very
bright
young
lady
and
instead
of
rushing
down
here
to
visit
you
when
you
arrived
she
waited
till
i
got
here
and
then
she
asked
me
what
she
should
do
i
told
her
that
there
must
not
be
even
a
breath
of
a
suggestion
that
there
was
anything
between
you
two
if
people
believed
she
had
ah
been
intimate
with
you
they
consider
her
a
loose
woman
doubly
so
because
you
an
indian
and
they
would
listen
to
a
word
she
said
i
understand
auguste
said
feeling
bitter
but
also
feeling
that
the
load
of
grief
he
borne
since
arriving
at
victor
had
lightened
a
little
nancy
had
not
forgotten
him
as
he
feared
she
might
after
she
got
back
among
whites
he
felt
shame
that
he
had
even
imagined
she
might
turn
against
him
and
when
the
trial
started
at
least
he
would
see
her
again
the
smell
of
wood
pervaded
the
courtroom
on
the
first
floor
of
the
village
hall
as
it
did
auguste
cell
frank
must
have
worked
seven
days
a
week
since
last
june
auguste
thought
even
though
he
hired
half
a
dozen
assistants
it
was
a
wonder
he
found
time
to
write
and
publish
his
newspaper
judge
david
cooper
a
man
with
a
square
muscular
face
and
piercing
blue
eyes
sat
at
a
long
table
with
the
flags
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
illinois
on
stands
behind
him
a
carpenter
mallet
lay
on
the
table
probably
borrowed
from
frank
auguste
thought
he
had
a
vague
memory
of
cooper
being
present
and
saying
something
to
raoul
the
day
he
been
driven
from
victoire
auguste
stood
as
cooper
read
out
the
charge
of
complicity
in
the
murder
of
citizens
of
the
state
of
illinois
by
the
british
band
of
the
sauk
and
fox
indian
tribes
behind
auguste
sat
three
lieutenant
jefferson
davis
and
his
two
corporals
the
prosecutor
justus
bennett
and
his
assistant
occupied
a
third
table
the
courtroom
being
not
quite
finished
the
twelve
jurymen
sat
on
one
side
of
the
room
in
two
pews
carried
over
from
the
presbyterian
church
auguste
knew
only
three
of
the
jurors
robert
mcallister
a
farmer
whose
family
had
survived
wolf
paw
raid
by
hiding
in
their
root
cellar
tom
slattery
the
blacksmith
and
kobell
a
stableman
from
victoire
he
had
no
reason
to
think
any
of
those
three
bore
him
any
special
ill
will
though
they
might
have
good
reason
to
hate
any
sauk
the
others
he
knew
not
at
all
which
meant
they
must
have
moved
to
victor
since
he
left
behind
the
trial
participants
about
fifty
citizens
of
smith
county
were
crowded
into
the
courtroom
sitting
in
chairs
or
on
benches
they
had
carried
into
the
village
hall
themselves
more
stood
along
the
walls
during
the
first
hour
of
the
trial
raoul
de
marion
the
first
witness
for
the
prosecution
testified
he
lounged
in
a
chair
beside
the
table
auguste
sat
in
a
cold
fury
as
he
heard
for
the
first
time
an
account
of
the
war
between
the
british
band
and
the
people
of
illinois
as
many
pale
eyes
must
have
seen
it
a
murdering
band
of
savages
had
invaded
the
state
the
brave
volunteers
had
pursued
them
endured
the
loss
of
comrades
but
eventually
had
triumphed
administering
a
righteous
retaliation
by
exterminating
most
of
the
invaders
bennett
a
lean
man
whose
rounded
shoulders
gave
him
a
serpentine
look
turned
to
thomas
ford
your
witness
sir
ford
very
erect
in
contrast
to
bennett
stood
up
and
walked
toward
raoul
de
marion
why
on
the
night
of
september
fifteenth
did
you
offer
a
reward
of
fifty
pieces
of
eight
to
anyone
who
would
kill
your
nephew
auguste
de
marion
objection
bennett
called
from
his
seat
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
defendant
conduct
in
the
black
hawk
war
on
the
contrary
your
honor
said
ford
it
explains
how
my
client
got
involved
in
the
war
i
allow
it
said
david
cooper
after
ford
repeated
his
question
raoul
said
i
do
remember
offering
any
reward
i
can
produce
at
least
ten
witnesses
who
heard
you
and
saw
you
hold
up
a
money
bag
well
he
provoked
me
he
tried
to
cheat
me
out
of
my
inheritance
apparently
you
already
got
control
of
the
estate
by
force
of
arms
was
it
necessary
to
go
on
and
incite
men
to
kill
him
i
figured
he
might
do
just
what
he
did
stir
up
the
sauk
against
us
and
try
to
use
them
to
take
the
land
away
from
me
ford
turned
to
the
jury
and
the
spectators
could
see
the
incredulous
look
on
his
face
auguste
felt
a
warmth
for
ford
he
seemed
to
know
what
he
was
doing
but
it
still
made
him
uneasy
to
know
that
his
life
was
in
the
hands
of
another
man
no
matter
how
competent
and
why
were
you
going
to
shoot
auguste
when
he
came
to
you
with
a
white
flag
at
old
man
creek
he
was
trying
to
lead
us
into
an
ambush
ford
sighed
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
took
a
few
paces
away
from
raoul
he
threw
an
exasperated
look
at
the
jury
as
if
to
say
can
i
do
with
this
man
then
he
turned
suddenly
and
said
de
marion
in
when
you
were
just
a
boy
were
you
not
present
at
the
incident
known
as
the
fort
dearborn
massacre
objection
said
bennett
this
certainly
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
man
who
on
trial
goes
to
the
character
of
the
witness
your
honor
said
ford
i
let
you
ask
the
question
said
cooper
please
answer
de
marion
raoul
hunched
over
and
his
face
grew
darker
god
knows
i
was
at
fort
dearborn
and
did
you
not
see
your
sister
horribly
murdered
by
indians
were
you
not
subjected
to
two
years
of
captivity
and
slavery
i
did
i
was
the
words
came
out
in
a
hoarse
whisper
ford
said
de
marion
after
those
terrible
boyhood
experiences
to
have
your
brother
attempt
to
bring
an
indian
into
the
family
must
have
seemed
the
crowning
insult
i
put
it
to
you
that
your
accusations
against
auguste
stem
not
from
any
misdeeds
of
his
but
from
your
hatred
for
him
because
he
is
an
indian
justus
bennett
was
on
his
feet
objection
the
honorable
defense
attorney
is
asking
questions
he
making
a
speech
defaming
the
witness
cooper
nodded
sustained
he
turned
to
the
jury
and
said
the
jury
will
forget
about
everything
they
just
heard
the
defense
attorney
say
auguste
shook
his
head
how
could
any
man
forget
something
he
had
just
so
clearly
heard
in
all
his
years
of
living
among
the
pale
eyes
he
had
never
attended
a
trial
now
on
trial
for
his
own
life
he
saw
that
the
ways
of
the
pale
eyes
were
even
stranger
than
he
had
ever
realized
the
next
prosecution
witness
was
armand
perrault
at
the
sight
of
armand
auguste
broke
out
in
a
cold
sweat
of
fury
this
man
frank
had
said
was
the
one
who
snatched
floating
lily
from
redbird
arms
walking
up
to
the
witness
chair
armand
avoided
auguste
eyes
always
before
he
had
shot
auguste
looks
of
hatred
today
he
was
showing
his
guilt
aching
knots
spread
through
all
auguste
muscles
were
he
alone
with
armand
he
would
hurl
himself
at
him
and
try
to
kill
him
barehanded
but
in
this
crowded
courtroom
he
was
helpless
his
hands
tightened
on
the
links
of
his
chain
till
they
hurt
he
felt
a
firm
grip
on
his
forearm
ford
sitting
beside
him
letting
him
know
that
he
sensed
his
pain
led
by
bennett
questions
armand
repeated
raoul
claim
that
the
three
peace
messengers
were
actually
the
vanguard
of
a
sauk
attack
why
do
they
keep
harping
on
this
auguste
asked
ford
in
a
whisper
makes
you
out
a
murderer
ford
said
out
of
the
side
of
his
mouth
if
you
tried
to
lead
the
white
militiamen
into
a
trap
at
old
man
creek
when
it
was
ford
turn
to
question
armand
he
said
you
pulled
the
trigger
on
one
of
black
hawk
peace
messengers
did
you
yes
said
armand
his
teeth
gleaming
in
his
brown
beard
and
i
did
not
miss
and
you
killed
an
indian
baby
on
the
road
going
through
town
about
three
weeks
ago
did
you
i
do
remember
ford
raised
his
hands
toward
the
beamed
ceiling
come
now
perrault
a
hundred
or
more
people
saw
you
drag
that
child
from
its
mother
arms
these
were
the
same
indians
who
came
here
and
murdered
my
wife
monsieur
légiste
that
baby
probably
was
even
born
when
your
wife
was
murdered
mr
perrault
i
ever
get
free
i
kill
you
perrault
by
the
white
bear
spirit
i
swear
a
chill
came
over
auguste
at
his
own
thought
he
recalled
owl
warning
against
trying
to
turn
the
power
of
the
spirits
against
any
other
human
being
terrible
consequences
lay
in
store
for
the
shaman
who
did
so
probably
going
to
be
hanged
as
it
is
what
else
can
happen
to
me
auguste
heard
raoul
voice
from
somewhere
behind
him
among
the
spectators
hey
bennett
are
you
going
to
say
anything
what
this
got
to
do
with
the
mongrel
order
cooper
rapped
on
his
table
with
a
carpenter
mallet
bennett
stood
up
a
little
uncertainly
if
it
please
your
honor
i
called
perrault
to
testify
about
what
happened
at
old
man
creek
i
do
see
why
counsel
for
the
defense
is
bringing
up
this
other
incident
all
right
your
honor
said
ford
i
have
no
more
questions
for
this
baby
killer
auguste
saw
sudden
pallor
in
the
part
of
armand
face
not
covered
by
his
beard
objection
shouted
bennett
ford
looked
pained
what
in
heaven
name
is
wrong
with
calling
a
spade
a
spade
cooper
said
well
try
to
keep
your
language
a
little
more
elevated
mr
ford
certainly
your
honor
i
have
no
more
questions
for
this
infanticide
as
ford
turned
away
to
sit
down
auguste
saw
a
quick
little
smile
crease
judge
cooper
face
then
disappear
he
began
to
feel
hope
stirring
in
a
heart
that
had
been
heavy
ever
since
he
came
to
victor
this
trial
would
not
be
conducted
according
to
lynch
law
but
he
still
burned
with
hatred
for
armand
perrault
he
turned
to
watch
perrault
go
back
to
his
seat
and
his
skin
tingled
just
past
the
lieutenant
davis
nancy
was
sitting
only
two
rows
of
chairs
away
her
deep
blue
eyes
widened
as
she
looked
at
him
her
smile
was
as
cooper
had
been
just
a
brief
shadow
but
her
face
flushed
and
she
shook
her
head
almost
imperceptibly
auguste
understood
as
ford
had
said
if
nancy
were
to
testify
in
his
behalf
people
must
never
know
what
they
had
been
to
each
other
all
their
hatred
for
red
men
would
come
boiling
up
and
they
would
hang
him
for
having
intercourse
with
a
white
woman
if
for
nothing
else
he
nodded
ever
so
slightly
tore
his
eyes
away
from
hers
woodrow
was
sitting
beside
nancy
holding
her
hand
he
had
no
need
to
hide
his
feelings
and
gave
auguste
a
big
grin
auguste
smiled
back
at
him
but
at
the
sight
of
woodrow
longing
for
eagle
feather
was
a
knife
in
his
heart
do
even
know
whether
eagle
feather
is
and
grief
for
poor
little
floating
lily
crushed
him
there
were
frank
and
nicole
sitting
together
with
one
of
their
smaller
children
patrick
auguste
thought
squirming
on
nicole
lap
the
sight
of
the
baby
made
him
want
to
weep
there
were
elysée
and
guichard
two
old
men
sitting
side
by
side
grandpapa
had
a
home
of
his
own
now
he
told
auguste
while
visiting
him
a
small
frame
house
on
a
hillside
north
of
town
also
built
by
frank
and
a
young
doctor
named
surrey
who
had
just
moved
into
the
county
looked
in
on
elysée
regularly
that
they
have
a
new
doctor
too
bad
though
gram
medill
had
died
of
an
infection
auguste
had
heard
that
she
refused
to
let
surrey
treat
auguste
saw
many
more
spectators
whom
he
did
not
recognize
people
who
stared
back
at
him
with
hostility
or
at
best
curiosity
a
handsome
young
woman
wearing
a
black
bonnet
and
a
black
dress
caught
his
eye
there
was
a
strange
intensity
in
her
look
but
her
mouth
was
drawn
tight
and
he
could
not
tell
whether
she
felt
hatred
or
sympathy
for
him
then
he
remembered
who
she
was
pamela
russell
widow
of
the
town
clerk
whose
brains
had
been
dashed
out
by
a
sauk
war
club
during
the
attack
on
victor
nicole
on
one
of
her
visits
to
the
village
hall
had
described
russell
death
to
him
and
told
him
how
pamela
had
insisted
on
touching
off
the
cannon
that
broke
the
war
party
attack
will
probably
want
to
be
the
one
to
put
the
rope
around
my
the
prosecutor
called
levi
pope
to
the
stand
the
shambling
backwoodsman
held
his
coonskin
cap
in
his
hand
as
he
approached
the
witness
chair
this
was
the
first
time
auguste
could
remember
seeing
him
without
a
rifle
its
absence
made
him
look
strange
bennett
led
levi
pope
through
an
account
of
old
man
creek
then
thomas
ford
rose
to
question
him
all
right
levi
when
the
three
indians
including
auguste
came
into
your
camp
with
the
peace
flag
how
you
know
it
was
treachery
levi
frowned
and
shook
his
head
well
when
we
seen
that
the
woods
was
full
of
injuns
now
we
heard
many
times
during
this
trial
that
woods
was
full
of
injuns
how
many
indians
did
you
see
was
me
that
saw
them
it
was
the
scouts
colonel
raoul
sent
out
so
you
did
see
any
sign
yourself
that
the
indians
were
trying
to
lead
you
into
some
kind
of
trap
well
no
sir
and
when
you
rode
into
the
forest
on
the
north
side
of
old
man
creek
did
you
see
any
indians
no
sir
they
must
of
all
run
off
by
that
time
when
did
you
first
meet
up
with
indians
oh
we
rode
maybe
an
hour
up
along
the
river
it
was
full
dark
then
and
they
come
down
off
a
hill
in
front
of
us
and
screaming
a
frontal
attack
then
if
the
indians
were
planning
to
ambush
you
what
did
they
gain
by
sending
three
men
into
your
camp
claiming
they
wanted
to
talk
surrender
levi
pope
face
seemed
to
elongate
as
he
contemplated
ford
question
i
do
rightly
know
do
you
think
the
indians
are
stupid
mr
pope
well
they
was
stupid
to
start
this
war
levi
grinned
at
ford
looking
pleased
with
himself
auguste
heard
some
appreciative
chuckles
from
the
spectators
he
turned
and
saw
levi
pope
wife
a
skinny
pale
woman
frowning
at
her
husband
as
if
his
testimony
made
her
angry
ford
nodded
and
held
off
on
making
his
reply
while
he
paced
the
open
space
before
the
judge
table
and
let
his
calm
gaze
travel
over
all
the
spectators
and
jurymen
he
waited
until
the
hall
was
quiet
maybe
the
indians
thought
it
was
a
stupid
war
too
pope
maybe
that
is
the
real
reason
black
hawk
sent
those
three
braves
to
your
camp
objection
called
bennett
ford
is
just
speculating
ford
said
your
honor
the
claim
by
colonel
de
marion
and
others
that
the
indian
attempt
to
make
peace
in
which
auguste
de
marion
participated
was
some
kind
of
dastardly
trick
is
itself
merely
speculation
judge
cooper
grunted
well
let
stick
to
what
people
know
not
what
they
think
they
know
fine
with
me
your
honor
said
ford
as
long
as
the
prosecution
is
held
to
the
same
standard
auguste
belly
tightened
as
he
heard
ford
speak
sharply
to
the
judge
he
seen
some
hope
in
cooper
he
did
want
him
antagonized
then
he
slumped
letting
his
manacled
hands
dangle
what
difference
he
have
a
chance
anyway
ford
went
back
to
his
seat
smiling
grimly
at
auguste
and
levi
pope
looking
somewhat
puzzled
slouched
back
to
his
place
among
the
spectators
judge
cooper
declared
that
proceedings
were
over
for
the
day
and
that
the
defense
would
call
its
witnesses
tomorrow
hopelessly
auguste
stood
up
and
bent
over
to
pick
up
the
iron
ball
chained
to
his
leg
perhaps
he
thought
lynch
law
would
be
better
at
least
it
would
not
prolong
his
suffering
make
him
relive
moment
by
moment
everything
he
and
those
he
loved
had
suffered
over
the
past
year
and
sooner
or
later
he
was
bound
to
end
up
in
the
same
place
a
grave
the
following
day
nicole
was
sitting
in
the
witness
chair
answering
ford
questions
in
a
soft
melodious
voice
ford
asked
do
you
agree
hopkins
with
your
brother
charge
that
auguste
is
a
renegade
and
murderer
nicole
full
face
reddened
with
anger
my
god
no
auguste
never
turned
against
us
he
left
smith
county
because
raoul
would
have
had
him
murdered
if
he
stayed
auguste
has
never
harmed
anyone
ford
next
witness
was
pamela
russell
hearing
the
spectators
murmuring
questions
to
one
another
after
ford
called
her
name
auguste
wondered
anxiously
what
a
woman
whose
husband
had
been
killed
by
wolf
paw
raid
on
victor
could
possibly
say
that
would
help
him
her
black
dress
and
bonnet
made
her
face
look
even
paler
she
clutched
a
black
leather
bag
in
her
lap
ford
said
russell
did
your
late
husband
entrust
any
papers
to
you
concerning
auguste
de
marion
not
exactly
but
he
kept
such
papers
in
our
house
and
told
me
about
them
i
kept
them
safe
after
he
died
what
were
they
a
certificate
of
adoption
and
a
will
why
did
he
keep
them
in
your
home
instead
of
in
the
village
hall
pamela
russell
dark
eyes
flashed
as
she
searched
the
courtroom
looking
auguste
suspected
for
raoul
raoul
de
marion
who
never
let
my
husband
forget
that
he
owed
his
job
to
him
ordered
burke
to
destroy
both
papers
that
a
lie
came
raoul
shout
from
the
back
of
the
hall
justus
bennett
looked
toward
raoul
and
said
colonel
de
marion
please
what
this
woman
is
saying
might
even
help
our
case
all
right
raoul
called
but
you
watch
what
you
doing
now
russell
ford
began
again
burke
knew
that
what
he
told
him
to
do
was
wrong
so
instead
of
destroying
the
adoption
certificate
and
the
will
he
brought
them
home
and
kept
them
in
his
strongbox
in
our
cellar
when
the
indians
burned
our
house
the
papers
survived
she
paused
gazing
over
ford
head
the
papers
survived
do
you
have
them
now
mrs
russell
she
unbuckled
the
strap
that
closed
the
leather
bag
in
her
lap
and
drew
out
two
folded
pieces
of
paper
she
handed
them
to
ford
who
unfolded
them
with
a
flourish
and
turned
to
the
judge
ford
asked
your
honor
may
i
read
these
documents
to
the
court
go
right
ahead
said
judge
cooper
first
the
certificate
of
adoption
said
ford
auguste
felt
a
hard
lump
rise
to
block
his
throat
as
ford
read
the
statement
that
pierre
de
marion
on
the
sixteenth
day
of
august
did
declare
his
natural
son
hereafter
to
be
known
as
auguste
de
marion
to
be
his
lawful
son
granting
him
all
rights
and
privileges
to
which
that
status
might
entitle
him
auguste
covered
his
burning
eyes
with
his
hand
meant
so
much
to
now
said
ford
the
will
pierre
de
marion
residing
on
the
estate
called
victoire
in
the
county
of
smith
and
state
of
illinois
make
this
my
will
and
revoke
all
prior
wills
and
codicils
it
was
the
will
auguste
had
fought
against
until
pierre
had
finally
persuaded
him
to
smoke
the
calumet
the
will
giving
the
château
and
the
land
to
auguste
there
were
also
monetary
gifts
to
a
number
of
servants
including
one
of
two
hundred
dollars
to
armand
and
marchette
perrault
auguste
heard
an
buzzing
among
the
spectators
by
seizing
the
estate
and
concealing
the
will
raoul
had
wiped
out
these
gifts
have
to
face
some
angry
servants
today
auguste
thought
with
satisfaction
including
that
swine
perrault
the
prosecution
will
want
to
see
those
papers
said
bennett
when
ford
had
finished
reading
of
course
said
cooper
you
may
have
a
look
any
time
in
my
presence
after
ford
had
given
the
jurors
the
two
papers
to
look
at
and
had
returned
them
to
cooper
table
he
turned
to
bennett
your
witness
bennett
slouched
into
the
open
area
before
the
judge
table
no
questions
russell
widowed
by
those
savages
has
surely
suffered
enough
pamela
russell
stayed
sitting
in
the
chair
beside
the
judge
table
clutching
her
leather
bag
her
bosom
auguste
saw
was
rising
and
falling
with
some
powerful
emotion
that
all
pamela
david
cooper
said
softly
you
can
go
now
she
stood
up
looking
like
a
woman
in
a
trance
and
moved
slowly
toward
the
door
in
the
rear
of
the
courtroom
auguste
turned
in
his
seat
to
watch
her
she
stopped
before
raoul
who
was
sitting
near
the
back
he
stared
up
at
her
as
she
pointed
at
him
how
dare
you
call
me
a
liar
raoul
de
marion
when
it
you
that
lied
about
what
you
told
my
husband
my
husband
never
fired
a
gun
before
in
his
life
and
he
had
to
stand
up
and
be
killed
because
you
took
all
the
men
who
could
shoot
away
with
you
i
hope
those
papers
ruin
you
spots
of
red
stood
out
on
her
cheeks
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hand
and
rushed
out
of
the
courtroom
how
come
you
did
shut
her
up
judge
raoul
shouted
after
she
was
gone
i
figured
she
deserved
to
have
her
say
said
cooper
calmly
ford
said
the
defense
calls
miss
nancy
hale
auguste
heart
started
to
beat
harder
as
he
watched
nancy
tall
and
straight
in
a
pale
violet
dress
walk
to
the
witness
chair
just
what
he
had
feared
a
year
ago
when
nancy
first
asked
him
to
make
love
to
her
had
happened
he
felt
a
love
for
her
an
impossible
love
now
that
was
as
strong
in
its
way
as
the
love
he
felt
for
redbird
in
answer
to
ford
questions
nancy
told
how
she
had
been
captured
and
how
auguste
had
intervened
to
protect
her
and
later
to
protect
woodrow
she
told
how
he
had
risked
his
life
to
escort
her
and
woodrow
to
safety
and
had
ended
up
being
captured
bennett
got
up
to
miss
hale
this
may
be
a
hard
question
for
you
to
answer
in
open
court
but
it
is
important
to
this
trial
it
that
indians
are
no
respecters
of
the
virtue
of
white
women
so
what
i
asking
you
is
he
paused
and
leaned
over
her
were
you
subjected
to
anything
of
a
shameful
nature
while
you
were
a
prisoner
of
the
sauk
objection
called
ford
the
question
itself
is
shameful
it
has
no
possible
bearing
on
this
case
judge
cooper
glared
at
bennett
what
call
do
you
have
to
ask
her
that
defense
counsel
has
taken
us
down
a
lot
of
winding
roads
your
honor
i
attempting
to
determine
facts
about
the
defendant
character
i
allow
it
said
cooper
his
voice
low
and
reluctant
and
bennett
turned
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
to
nancy
and
repeated
his
question
nancy
looked
him
coldly
in
the
eye
i
already
said
auguste
de
marion
protected
me
i
was
never
harmed
bennett
narrowed
his
eyes
raoul
had
chosen
the
man
well
for
his
purposes
auguste
thought
hating
bennett
for
tormenting
nancy
well
but
what
about
auguste
de
marion
himself
did
you
live
in
one
of
their
huts
with
him
did
he
ever
approach
you
with
lewd
intent
certainly
not
said
nancy
yes
i
did
live
in
his
the
word
is
wickiup
bennett
but
the
situation
was
perfectly
proper
his
wife
and
child
were
with
us
all
the
time
from
the
back
of
the
hall
raoul
brayed
she
probably
enjoyed
it
she
always
had
an
eye
for
the
mongrel
auguste
felt
his
neck
grow
hot
he
wanted
to
kill
but
someone
would
stop
him
before
he
reached
raoul
and
even
to
try
to
attack
him
would
only
confirm
the
picture
bennett
was
trying
to
paint
of
a
murderous
savage
he
forced
himself
to
sit
still
and
yet
he
thought
as
he
breathed
deeply
to
calm
himself
it
was
nancy
who
was
concealing
the
truth
and
bennett
and
raoul
who
sensed
what
had
really
happened
but
their
very
words
for
it
shameful
lewd
intent
turned
the
truth
into
a
lie
he
and
nancy
had
proclaimed
their
love
in
honor
before
the
british
band
now
he
felt
as
if
he
were
tied
down
on
a
forest
floor
and
weasels
and
crows
were
biting
and
pecking
at
him
why
must
he
and
nancy
hide
their
love
from
these
people
he
heard
indignant
murmurs
provoked
by
raoul
outburst
shocking
someone
said
no
gentleman
would
talk
that
way
auguste
heard
lieutenant
davis
sitting
behind
him
say
to
one
of
his
men
if
i
were
on
duty
i
teach
that
scoundrel
a
lesson
someone
with
the
accent
of
victoire
called
out
raoul
your
father
is
right
tu
es
un
sauvage
cooper
pounded
on
his
table
with
his
wooden
mallet
until
there
was
silence
thomas
ford
called
master
woodrow
prewitt
will
you
take
the
stand
please
woodrow
walked
past
auguste
who
felt
a
warmth
for
him
and
again
a
pang
of
longing
for
eagle
feather
under
ford
questions
woodrow
told
how
white
bear
and
redbird
had
treated
him
like
a
foster
son
and
how
white
bear
had
helped
them
escape
when
it
was
bennett
turn
he
stood
threateningly
over
woodrow
have
you
forgotten
young
man
that
you
had
a
real
white
christian
father
and
mother
have
you
forgotten
what
the
indians
did
to
them
no
sir
said
woodrow
in
a
small
voice
well
then
how
can
you
make
it
out
that
this
and
his
squaw
were
such
fine
people
they
held
you
prisoner
sir
my
pa
used
to
whip
me
before
breakfast
and
after
supper
my
ma
laid
in
bed
most
days
drunk
white
bear
auguste
he
was
kind
to
me
so
was
his
missus
living
with
them
was
shinin
shining
bennett
looked
disgusted
woodrow
shrugged
well
been
if
the
soldiers
had
always
been
chasing
us
auguste
heard
the
thump
of
boots
he
turned
to
see
raoul
storming
up
from
the
back
of
the
room
that
boy
lying
raoul
roared
indians
took
me
prisoner
when
i
was
his
age
i
know
firsthand
how
kind
they
are
i
got
the
scars
to
prove
it
the
white
squaw
has
made
it
worthwhile
for
the
kid
to
lie
if
i
get
my
hands
on
him
i
beat
the
truth
out
of
him
sit
down
sir
lieutenant
davis
jumped
up
from
his
seat
behind
auguste
and
blocked
raoul
way
auguste
turned
to
see
raoul
big
frame
just
a
few
feet
from
him
close
enough
for
him
to
smell
whiskey
fumes
this
is
none
of
your
business
davis
raoul
growled
general
winfield
scott
and
colonel
zachary
taylor
commanded
me
to
see
that
this
man
receives
a
proper
trial
said
davis
in
a
calm
steady
voice
judge
cooper
rapped
his
mallet
de
marion
i
wo
allow
you
to
disrupt
this
court
raoul
shouted
at
cooper
over
davis
shoulder
do
you
forget
cooper
that
when
you
not
wearing
that
black
robe
you
just
a
small
farmer
who
bought
his
land
from
me
and
sells
his
crop
to
me
cooper
was
standing
now
his
jaw
clenched
that
enough
de
marion
sit
down
raoul
head
turned
slowly
from
side
to
side
for
a
moment
he
stared
at
auguste
his
eyes
full
of
hate
auguste
felt
an
answering
hatred
boiling
up
in
his
chest
raoul
and
the
lieutenant
stood
facing
each
other
for
a
long
silent
moment
then
raoul
turned
abruptly
and
strode
back
to
his
seat
auguste
whose
attention
had
been
fixed
on
raoul
and
davis
became
aware
of
men
sitting
down
all
over
the
courtroom
he
wondered
whether
they
were
raoul
men
auguste
felt
his
guts
squirm
as
he
realized
what
a
thin
barrier
protected
this
trial
from
being
abruptly
ended
raoul
could
call
on
his
crew
of
rogues
to
drag
him
out
and
hang
him
at
once
the
judge
and
the
three
federal
soldiers
might
not
be
able
to
stop
him
ford
called
auguste
to
the
witness
chair
auguste
had
sat
rigid
for
so
long
that
standing
up
made
him
stumble
and
ford
put
a
steadying
hand
on
his
arm
as
he
sat
down
he
felt
himself
trembling
at
the
sight
of
dozens
of
pale
eyes
faces
hard
solemn
and
expressionless
looking
at
him
bearded
men
squirting
tobacco
juice
into
brass
spittoons
women
eyeing
him
from
under
bonnets
he
looked
for
the
friendly
faces
in
the
room
nancy
woodrow
elysée
guichard
nicole
frank
ford
said
we
heard
bits
and
pieces
of
your
story
from
many
different
people
auguste
if
you
were
just
another
sauk
indian
you
would
be
on
trial
here
today
you
be
with
your
people
what
left
of
them
but
because
you
lived
with
whites
and
your
father
was
white
and
you
have
a
claim
to
a
white
man
property
you
accused
of
being
a
traitor
and
a
murderer
i
want
you
to
tell
us
about
your
life
how
come
you
both
indian
and
white
man
as
auguste
talked
he
forgot
the
watching
faces
and
saw
again
sun
woman
and
star
arrow
black
hawk
and
owl
carver
redbird
and
nancy
saukenuk
and
victoire
old
man
creek
and
the
bad
axe
when
he
was
done
ford
thanked
him
quietly
and
sat
down
it
was
bennett
turn
he
shuffled
toward
auguste
fixing
him
with
small
eyes
that
glinted
with
malice
we
have
to
take
your
word
for
it
that
you
spoke
for
peace
in
the
councils
of
the
sauk
and
fox
indians
do
we
and
we
have
to
take
your
word
that
you
went
to
the
camp
of
colonel
de
marion
spy
battalion
on
an
errand
of
peace
do
we
that
right
auguste
said
bitterly
because
all
my
witnesses
are
dead
do
try
to
get
us
to
feel
sorry
for
you
bennett
rasped
this
courtroom
is
full
of
people
who
seen
loved
ones
stabbed
shot
scalped
cut
to
pieces
burnt
to
ashes
at
the
hands
of
your
indians
he
raised
his
voice
to
a
shout
and
while
that
was
happening
you
were
behind
the
red
fiends
urging
them
on
to
kill
and
kill
some
more
he
turned
away
face
twisted
in
disgust
i
have
no
more
questions
for
you
cooper
said
does
the
defense
have
any
more
witnesses
no
your
honor
said
ford
and
auguste
heart
sank
as
he
walked
back
to
his
seat
bennett
he
felt
had
finished
him
with
those
few
sentences
reminding
people
what
the
sauk
had
done
to
them
auguste
turned
to
ford
whose
round
face
was
blank
unreadable
no
hope
there
ford
had
done
his
best
auguste
was
sure
but
he
had
no
more
chance
against
the
hatred
here
in
victor
than
black
hawk
band
had
against
the
armies
of
the
united
states
am
going
to
be
hold
it
there
called
a
voice
from
the
doorway
of
the
courtroom
he
got
two
more
witnesses
auguste
saw
a
tall
mustached
man
thumping
up
from
the
back
of
the
court
with
the
aid
of
a
crutch
and
a
peg
leg
beside
him
a
skinny
man
with
a
small
head
and
a
grin
shuffled
over
the
plank
floor
a
rifle
hung
from
one
long
arm
it
took
him
a
moment
to
recognize
otto
wegner
and
eli
greenglove
alert
wary
he
watched
them
come
up
the
aisle
between
the
chairs
cooper
raised
a
hand
in
warning
said
greenglove
you
have
to
put
that
rifle
down
before
you
come
any
farther
so
be
it
said
greenglove
handing
the
rifle
to
one
of
jefferson
davis
corporals
who
had
risen
to
bar
his
way
i
just
needed
it
to
make
sure
i
got
this
far
alive
ford
came
over
to
auguste
and
said
in
a
low
voice
i
take
it
these
men
are
offering
to
testify
in
your
defense
do
you
want
them
i
think
wegner
must
be
here
to
help
me
said
auguste
but
i
know
why
greenglove
is
here
he
remembered
his
conviction
that
greenglove
had
missed
him
on
purpose
and
shrugged
i
have
got
much
to
lose
ford
began
with
wegner
asking
him
how
he
came
to
be
in
victor
when
word
was
he
had
emigrated
to
texas
my
family
and
i
only
got
as
far
as
new
orleans
where
we
are
buying
provisions
to
join
the
colony
at
san
felipe
de
austin
then
this
gentleman
comes
to
me
wegner
pointed
to
greenglove
now
sitting
in
the
front
row
of
spectators
he
tells
me
herr
auguste
is
to
be
tried
at
victor
at
once
we
take
the
steamboat
i
pay
for
both
his
passage
and
mine
using
money
my
family
needs
i
tell
you
this
not
to
praise
myself
but
to
show
how
much
that
man
means
to
me
now
wegner
pointed
to
auguste
who
looked
down
at
the
floor
his
face
hot
and
his
throat
choked
ford
nodded
gravely
i
understand
you
were
at
old
man
creek
wegner
what
happened
to
you
wegner
told
the
story
just
as
auguste
remembered
it
ending
i
lost
my
leg
but
i
still
have
my
life
thanks
to
auguste
de
marion
for
whom
i
never
did
a
single
thing
good
i
could
have
taken
him
back
to
the
sauk
camp
i
might
even
have
saved
his
ford
said
wegner
we
heard
that
auguste
de
marion
is
a
murderer
and
a
traitor
to
his
country
lies
said
otto
wegner
firmly
by
the
rules
of
war
he
had
every
right
to
kill
me
and
he
did
not
he
is
the
most
christian
man
i
have
ever
known
wonder
if
wegner
knows
i
have
never
believed
in
any
spirits
but
earthmaker
and
the
turtle
and
the
returning
from
the
witness
chair
wegner
stopped
to
take
auguste
hand
in
both
of
his
i
am
so
glad
i
could
come
and
speak
for
you
you
are
a
man
herr
auguste
auguste
struggling
to
hold
back
tears
murmured
his
thanks
perhaps
elysée
could
replace
the
money
wegner
had
spent
getting
here
if
the
prussian
was
not
too
proud
to
take
it
ford
began
questioning
eli
greenglove
about
old
man
creek
hell
there
were
no
injuns
in
ambush
in
the
woods
greenglove
drawled
was
plain
as
day
what
was
going
on
they
was
a
few
scouts
that
come
to
watch
what
happened
to
the
peace
party
most
of
our
men
were
carrying
a
right
powerful
load
of
whiskey
some
of
the
men
saw
the
scouts
hiding
in
the
woods
and
got
excited
colonel
raoul
he
used
that
as
an
excuse
to
order
us
to
finish
off
the
injuns
with
the
white
flag
and
you
shot
auguste
ford
asked
i
give
him
that
ear
greenglove
pointed
in
the
general
direction
of
auguste
right
ear
hoped
he
be
smart
enough
to
play
possum
after
he
was
hit
why
did
you
choose
not
to
kill
auguste
did
you
think
it
would
be
murder
greenglove
cackled
scornfully
hell
that
never
stopped
me
before
no
it
was
real
simple
he
paused
and
the
courtroom
was
still
i
saved
that
boy
life
because
i
wanted
colonel
raoul
to
marry
my
daughter
clarissa
and
suddenly
eli
greenglove
started
to
cry
tears
ran
down
his
bony
cheeks
and
sobs
shook
his
lean
frame
ford
stood
looking
turned
to
stare
at
auguste
who
himself
was
dumbfounded
having
never
seen
a
man
like
eli
greenglove
cry
bennett
broke
the
embarrassed
silence
your
honor
i
do
see
what
this
man
daughter
has
to
do
with
the
case
greenglove
moist
eyes
narrowed
to
angry
slits
just
shut
up
a
minute
lawyer
and
i
tell
you
my
daughter
lived
with
raoul
de
marion
for
seven
years
and
bore
him
two
kids
but
he
would
marry
her
because
she
were
good
enough
for
him
no
he
had
to
have
the
preacher
daughter
that
lady
miss
hale
he
pointed
toward
the
spectators
but
she
was
sweet
on
pierre
boy
auguste
and
i
could
see
he
had
an
eye
for
her
too
as
long
as
auguste
was
alive
i
figured
there
be
a
chance
that
miss
hale
would
run
off
with
him
so
i
made
sure
to
keep
him
alive
auguste
heart
sank
if
the
jury
believed
what
greenglove
was
saying
now
would
that
make
them
think
that
there
must
have
been
something
between
him
and
nancy
when
she
was
kidnapped
by
the
sauk
greenglove
lips
drew
back
from
his
stained
teeth
but
then
that
sonofabitch
raoul
had
to
go
and
kill
black
hawk
men
that
brought
the
white
flag
there
were
no
real
war
before
that
happened
if
he
sent
them
messengers
on
to
general
atkinson
the
whole
thing
would
been
over
in
may
every
one
of
them
white
people
soldiers
and
farmers
men
women
and
children
was
killed
by
that
man
there
he
pointed
a
skinny
finger
in
raoul
direction
meanin
my
daughter
clarissa
and
my
two
grandkids
your
daughter
was
a
slut
greenglove
raoul
shouted
never
married
her
if
she
lived
to
be
a
hundred
auguste
turned
and
saw
him
standing
in
the
back
of
the
courtroom
perrault
and
a
few
more
of
his
bully
boys
flanking
him
oh
said
greenglove
in
a
whisper
that
somehow
was
loud
enough
for
the
whole
court
to
hear
you
are
very
lucky
they
took
my
rifle
away
from
me
colonel
raoul
ford
said
i
think
that
all
bennett
do
you
wish
to
raoul
from
the
back
cut
in
judge
this
man
is
a
deserter
from
my
militia
battalion
he
been
on
the
run
for
the
past
three
months
what
he
said
here
is
worth
nothing
cooper
frowned
at
greenglove
then
at
raoul
i
do
see
what
difference
that
makes
they
bring
convicted
criminals
out
of
prison
cells
to
testify
ford
said
in
fact
if
this
man
risked
arrest
to
come
here
that
makes
his
testimony
all
the
more
believable
to
say
nothing
of
going
all
the
way
to
new
orleans
to
bring
wegner
back
no
it
does
show
him
any
more
honest
bennett
spoke
up
it
just
means
he
wants
revenge
against
raoul
de
marion
cooper
rapped
with
his
mallet
the
testimony
can
stand
the
decide
what
it
worth
lieutenant
davis
have
your
corporals
see
that
wegner
and
greenglove
reach
the
town
limits
safely
and
then
lieutenant
i
like
a
word
with
you
meanwhile
the
lawyers
for
each
side
can
sum
up
flanked
by
the
two
corporals
greenglove
and
otto
wegner
started
side
by
side
toward
the
courtroom
door
wegner
peg
leg
thumping
on
the
plank
floor
you
go
to
hell
eli
raoul
snarled
as
greenglove
passed
him
greenglove
laughed
i
got
a
better
idea
from
ol
otto
here
i
to
texas
the
two
men
walked
out
the
door
as
a
silence
fell
over
the
courtroom
auguste
wondered
had
their
testimony
saved
him
they
had
told
the
truth
about
what
happened
at
old
man
creek
but
since
when
had
truth
meant
anything
to
the
pale
eyes
if
those
twelve
men
sitting
in
church
pews
on
the
right
side
of
the
courtroom
decided
they
wanted
to
hang
him
they
would
hang
him
even
if
their
jesus
spirit
himself
came
into
the
courtroom
and
told
the
truth
about
him
and
after
seeing
the
slaughter
at
the
bad
axe
could
auguste
doubt
that
killing
all
red
people
was
what
all
pale
eyes
most
wanted
to
do
cooper
and
the
lieutenant
talked
quietly
at
the
judge
table
when
cooper
called
on
bennett
to
sum
up
the
prosecutor
rose
and
sidled
over
to
the
jury
about
the
supposed
adoption
papers
and
pierre
de
marion
alleged
will
russell
claim
that
raoul
de
marion
ordered
these
papers
destroyed
is
hearsay
she
has
no
direct
knowledge
that
de
marion
gave
any
such
instructions
to
her
husband
more
important
if
pierre
de
marion
adopted
auguste
that
makes
auguste
a
citizen
and
his
participating
in
acts
of
war
by
the
sauk
nation
against
the
united
states
is
treason
auguste
made
war
on
his
own
flag
whether
raoul
de
marion
did
right
or
wrong
in
running
his
nephew
off
victoire
gentlemen
one
thing
is
sure
auguste
went
back
to
the
british
band
carrying
a
powerful
grudge
against
this
place
and
these
people
so
i
put
it
to
you
he
decided
that
if
he
could
not
be
a
white
landowner
he
would
destroy
the
white
landowners
and
he
had
the
power
to
do
it
because
the
indians
would
listen
to
him
they
knew
him
as
a
witch
doctor
and
they
also
knew
that
he
had
been
educated
among
whites
and
so
he
used
his
power
to
push
black
hawk
toward
war
he
is
an
accomplice
to
the
murder
of
every
white
man
woman
and
child
killed
by
his
fellow
tribesmen
auguste
de
marion
or
white
bear
or
whatever
he
chooses
to
call
himself
bennett
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
auguste
should
be
hanged
as
a
traitor
and
a
butcher
of
his
own
people
auguste
heard
mutterings
of
approval
from
around
the
courtroom
and
a
loud
damned
right
from
raoul
his
feeling
that
this
trial
was
hopeless
grew
deeper
bennett
had
told
the
jury
what
they
wanted
to
hear
the
version
of
the
truth
that
would
let
them
do
what
they
wanted
to
him
ford
stood
up
wiping
his
brow
the
room
was
hot
for
late
september
he
crossed
the
front
of
the
courtroom
to
stand
before
the
two
rows
of
jurymen
in
their
borrowed
church
pews
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
took
up
arms
against
the
sauk
and
fox
indians
under
general
edmund
gaines
in
i
am
not
prejudiced
in
favor
of
indians
i
only
ask
that
you
try
to
understand
man
whose
life
is
in
your
hands
you
have
to
decide
two
questions
one
by
traveling
and
living
with
the
british
band
of
the
sauk
and
fox
from
september
to
august
did
auguste
de
marion
commit
treason
against
the
united
states
two
is
auguste
de
marion
guilty
of
the
murder
of
any
citizens
of
the
united
states
or
the
state
of
illinois
is
auguste
a
traitor
to
his
country
well
it
seems
to
me
that
if
anything
auguste
holds
dual
citizenship
in
the
united
states
and
in
the
sauk
and
fox
nation
and
far
from
being
a
traitor
to
either
he
tried
to
make
peace
between
them
the
only
thing
he
ever
carried
against
the
united
states
was
a
white
flag
has
auguste
committed
murder
all
we
know
for
a
fact
is
that
no
one
has
seen
him
raise
a
violent
hand
against
another
human
being
otto
wegner
told
you
how
auguste
had
a
chance
to
kill
him
and
instead
helped
him
escape
at
great
peril
to
himself
you
heard
pierre
de
marion
will
which
explains
why
raoul
de
marion
who
illegally
seized
the
great
house
known
as
victoire
has
been
so
eager
to
hound
this
young
man
to
his
death
this
man
has
lost
everything
a
man
holds
dear
his
father
and
mother
his
home
here
in
victor
his
home
among
the
sauk
almost
all
of
his
people
his
loved
ones
and
the
friends
of
his
youth
have
been
killed
everyone
who
lives
in
victor
knows
to
their
sorrow
what
happened
to
his
infant
daughter
his
wife
and
son
are
captives
too
and
he
can
not
be
with
them
or
provide
for
them
which
of
you
having
had
so
much
taken
from
him
so
cruelly
would
not
go
mad
with
grief
he
has
lost
so
much
all
he
has
left
is
his
life
let
us
not
i
beg
of
you
take
that
from
him
as
well
ford
sat
down
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
silence
auguste
tried
to
send
his
shaman
sense
forward
into
the
future
to
tell
him
how
the
jury
would
decide
but
his
spirit
met
a
blank
wall
he
glanced
out
a
nearby
unshuttered
window
and
saw
a
blue
afternoon
sky
with
a
few
white
clouds
within
the
wooden
walls
of
this
courtroom
sky
and
sun
prairie
and
river
seemed
very
far
away
judge
cooper
said
gentlemen
of
the
jury
we
have
prepared
a
room
upstairs
for
you
we
send
food
and
drink
to
you
as
you
require
there
are
cots
in
case
you
ca
make
up
your
minds
today
as
he
watched
the
twelve
men
file
up
the
stairs
behind
the
table
auguste
could
not
stop
his
mind
from
wandering
to
the
worst
he
thought
about
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
hanged
the
rough
grip
of
the
rope
on
his
neck
the
blood
bursting
in
his
head
the
world
going
black
his
body
jerking
in
hopeless
struggle
breath
cut
off
lungs
aching
the
final
silencing
of
his
heart
he
heard
a
harsh
laugh
in
the
back
of
the
room
he
turned
and
saw
raoul
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
men
standing
near
the
doorway
of
the
courtroom
beside
raoul
was
armand
perrault
raoul
looked
at
auguste
and
smiled
auguste
knew
what
that
smile
meant
whatever
the
jury
decided
for
him
there
would
be
no
escape
from
death
sharp
knife
late
that
afternoon
lieutenant
davis
called
auguste
from
his
cell
and
took
him
down
to
the
courtroom
judge
said
send
for
you
i
think
maybe
the
jury
reached
a
verdict
entering
through
the
rear
door
of
the
courtroom
auguste
met
eyes
and
his
longing
for
vengeance
made
his
blood
feel
like
molten
metal
in
his
veins
the
jurymen
came
in
through
a
side
door
robert
mcallister
foreman
of
the
jury
glanced
at
auguste
then
handed
david
cooper
a
folded
piece
of
paper
he
looked
at
you
ford
whispered
it
an
old
tale
among
lawyers
that
if
members
of
the
jury
have
found
the
defendant
guilty
they
do
look
at
him
cooper
read
the
note
and
sighed
loudly
as
if
he
found
the
message
burdensome
then
he
took
goose
quill
and
ink
and
wrote
a
note
of
his
own
mcallister
watched
him
write
looking
over
his
shoulder
sighed
as
heavily
as
cooper
had
looked
at
auguste
again
after
a
moment
he
nodded
and
took
the
judge
note
back
upstairs
well
said
judge
cooper
to
the
courtroom
at
large
it
seems
the
jury
a
pretty
fair
distance
from
a
verdict
they
ca
agree
on
a
lot
of
things
so
i
given
orders
that
they
stay
upstairs
and
keep
at
it
it
looks
like
we
wo
have
a
guilty
or
not
guilty
until
tomorrow
the
prisoner
will
go
back
upstairs
to
his
cell
court
will
open
at
nine
in
the
morning
auguste
heard
the
rear
door
of
the
courtroom
slam
and
knew
without
looking
around
that
raoul
had
left
that
night
auguste
lay
on
his
mattress
wondering
whether
he
should
try
to
run
away
when
they
took
him
out
to
be
shot
while
trying
to
escape
might
be
more
honorable
than
hanging
he
wished
he
could
see
redbird
and
eagle
feather
one
last
time
he
wished
nancy
would
come
to
visit
him
or
at
least
nicole
grandpapa
or
frank
but
lieutenant
davis
said
that
for
the
prisoner
safety
no
one
would
be
allowed
into
the
village
hall
tonight
he
heard
a
key
turning
in
his
door
lock
he
climbed
to
his
feet
come
on
said
davis
quickly
we
taking
you
out
of
here
come
to
kill
auguste
thought
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
an
inconvenient
indian
was
shot
while
trying
to
escape
but
his
shaman
insight
told
him
davis
was
as
trustworthy
as
any
sauk
why
before
the
verdict
they
did
reach
a
verdict
today
you
are
found
not
guilty
not
guilty
joy
flooded
through
him
as
he
stood
so
amazed
that
he
could
not
move
staring
at
the
open
cell
door
when
he
had
recovered
enough
to
move
auguste
followed
davis
out
of
the
village
hall
to
where
the
two
corporals
waited
with
horses
in
the
silent
street
the
river
rippled
black
and
silver
in
the
light
of
a
moon
the
ioway
bluffs
opposite
were
black
bison
shapes
under
a
sky
spangled
with
stars
the
moonlight
helped
auguste
guide
his
horse
up
the
steep
road
out
of
the
village
davis
led
followed
by
auguste
the
two
corporals
bringing
up
the
rear
after
weeks
of
imprisonment
auguste
reveled
in
the
cool
night
air
blowing
in
his
face
they
passed
the
trading
post
the
road
was
wider
here
and
the
three
soldiers
bunched
around
him
raoul
was
surely
in
there
getting
drunk
laughing
as
he
looked
forward
to
seeing
auguste
swinging
at
a
end
they
trotted
along
the
ridge
leading
to
victoire
auguste
heart
started
to
beat
harder
as
he
approached
the
place
that
had
been
his
home
the
remains
of
the
mansion
sprawled
on
its
hilltop
like
the
skeleton
of
some
huge
animal
blackened
timbers
rearing
up
in
the
moonlight
people
had
died
bloody
horrible
deaths
there
was
the
place
haunted
now
accursed
a
longing
came
over
him
to
climb
that
hill
again
to
sweep
away
that
ruin
and
rebuild
put
up
a
fine
new
house
like
the
ones
he
seen
in
the
east
could
do
so
much
with
this
land
but
i
running
away
from
it
again
leaving
it
to
raoul
then
they
were
past
victoire
but
the
yearning
for
it
clung
to
him
like
a
lover
scent
by
morning
you
be
far
out
of
your
uncle
reach
said
davis
riding
beside
him
auguste
heart
swelled
in
his
chest
with
the
thought
that
he
was
more
nearly
a
free
man
than
he
had
been
in
weeks
if
i
not
guilty
why
must
i
run
away
surely
you
realize
that
your
uncle
and
his
cronies
were
planning
to
take
you
straight
from
the
courtroom
to
the
nearest
tall
tree
if
the
court
did
sentence
you
to
death
the
foreman
brought
judge
cooper
a
note
stating
their
verdict
the
judge
wrote
back
telling
them
he
would
say
they
had
reached
a
verdict
and
he
wanted
them
to
remain
in
seclusion
overnight
while
we
spirited
you
out
of
town
they
were
willing
to
put
up
with
the
inconvenience
after
all
who
want
to
find
a
man
not
guilty
and
then
see
him
taken
out
and
hanged
auguste
heart
felt
like
a
cup
that
was
overflowing
the
jury
had
understood
him
they
had
believed
him
i
never
even
got
a
chance
to
thank
mr
ford
main
thanks
he
want
is
knowing
that
you
got
away
safely
as
they
rode
on
auguste
happiness
faded
the
town
that
had
been
his
home
for
six
years
had
exonerated
him
but
he
still
had
to
run
away
from
it
at
night
for
the
second
time
in
his
life
he
hated
to
do
this
this
was
something
else
raoul
had
taken
from
him
his
moment
of
vindication
pain
throbbed
in
auguste
chest
with
the
jouncing
of
the
horse
under
him
he
remembered
his
mother
body
like
a
castaway
doll
her
eyes
pathetically
wide
the
gash
in
her
throat
the
splash
of
blood
on
her
doeskin
dress
she
must
be
avenged
how
could
he
let
the
man
who
murdered
her
walk
free
silently
he
called
on
the
bear
spirit
to
avenge
sun
woman
again
he
remembered
it
was
wrong
to
ask
a
spirit
to
harm
any
person
even
so
if
he
could
not
hurt
raoul
himself
he
wanted
him
hurt
whatever
price
he
himself
might
pay
and
once
again
he
was
fleeing
from
people
he
loved
elysée
nicole
and
frank
nancy
soon
i
must
go
back
he
said
davis
turned
his
head
to
stare
at
him
go
back
in
the
name
of
the
great
jehovah
what
for
it
was
auguste
turn
to
be
surprised
it
seemed
so
obvious
that
he
had
to
return
to
victor
and
face
raoul
i
belong
in
victor
as
much
as
i
belong
with
the
sauk
he
could
not
he
decided
turn
his
back
on
victor
a
second
time
why
are
we
going
east
he
asked
you
have
been
found
not
guilty
in
victor
but
you
still
a
prisoner
of
war
auguste
your
future
is
in
the
hands
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
auguste
remembered
now
general
winfield
scott
at
the
hearing
at
fort
crawford
had
said
the
people
of
smith
county
do
hang
you
i
think
president
jackson
would
find
a
meeting
with
you
most
a
chill
spread
across
his
back
at
the
thought
of
meeting
andrew
jackson
himself
what
would
he
and
sharp
knife
have
to
say
to
each
other
auguste
leaned
into
a
small
window
cut
in
the
thick
stone
wall
of
fort
monroe
he
stared
through
iron
grillwork
at
a
expanse
of
rippling
water
eastward
on
the
horizon
lay
low
land
the
other
side
of
chesapeake
bay
pressing
his
forehead
against
the
bars
he
could
see
the
bay
opening
to
the
south
into
that
vast
open
ocean
the
pale
eyes
had
crossed
in
their
relentless
search
for
new
land
a
faint
breeze
cooled
auguste
brow
this
was
the
moon
of
falling
leaves
but
it
was
still
hot
as
summer
black
hawk
had
said
little
since
their
arrival
no
doubt
auguste
thought
the
old
war
leader
was
comparing
this
huge
stone
fortress
with
the
log
forts
of
the
long
knives
he
had
besieged
in
his
own
country
he
must
be
absorbing
the
lesson
it
taught
of
the
true
magnitude
of
the
long
knives
power
but
when
he
did
speak
he
sounded
as
defiant
as
ever
why
must
i
wear
the
clothing
of
my
enemies
black
hawk
stood
in
his
loincloth
staring
at
the
uniform
that
a
soldier
had
laid
out
on
his
bed
auguste
admired
black
hawk
lean
muscular
body
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
he
had
seen
summers
and
winters
his
wide
mouth
was
drawn
down
with
distaste
as
he
eyed
the
tall
shako
the
dark
blue
jacket
with
its
collar
gold
lace
chevrons
on
the
upper
arms
and
brass
buttons
the
lighter
blue
trousers
the
white
leather
belt
sharp
knife
wishes
to
show
his
respect
for
you
by
giving
you
the
dress
of
one
of
his
war
chiefs
said
auguste
is
also
his
way
of
reminding
you
that
you
are
subject
to
owl
carver
said
it
is
a
mark
of
hospitality
just
as
chief
falcon
gave
us
new
doeskin
garments
when
we
surrendered
to
the
winnebago
auguste
felt
a
thrill
of
pride
as
he
recalled
the
amazing
tale
owl
carver
had
told
him
about
eagle
feather
part
in
that
surrender
a
boy
not
yet
seven
summers
old
whose
vision
moved
him
and
showed
him
how
to
bring
a
war
to
an
end
was
surely
destined
for
great
things
owl
carver
looked
strange
with
his
long
white
hair
and
necklace
in
a
cutaway
coat
and
tight
gray
trousers
auguste
was
also
wearing
a
pale
eyes
suit
with
a
dark
brown
jacket
the
winnebago
prophet
was
dressed
similarly
in
shades
of
green
and
gray
auguste
had
shown
owl
carver
and
flying
cloud
how
to
don
the
pale
clothing
and
now
they
stood
stiff
and
uncomfortable
in
the
room
they
shared
waiting
for
black
hawk
to
put
on
his
military
garb
owl
carver
said
and
the
american
pale
eyes
are
not
your
enemies
any
more
you
have
made
your
mark
on
the
treaty
paper
this
time
for
all
time
said
auguste
putting
his
heart
into
his
voice
remembering
that
black
hawk
had
signed
and
broken
treaties
before
black
hawk
sighed
the
spirits
of
hundreds
dead
at
the
bad
axe
cry
out
to
me
that
the
americans
are
still
our
enemies
that
was
ever
black
hawk
way
auguste
thought
brooding
on
old
wrongs
regretting
agreements
made
with
the
pale
eyes
irreconcilable
will
never
change
but
we
must
one
hope
had
preoccupied
auguste
throughout
the
journey
east
by
steamboat
to
cincinnati
where
he
caught
up
with
black
hawk
party
by
coach
and
finally
by
that
astonishing
new
pale
invention
the
railroad
auguste
must
find
a
way
for
the
sauk
to
live
in
a
world
where
the
pale
eyes
ruled
absolutely
he
was
the
only
one
who
understood
both
sauk
and
pale
eyes
it
was
up
to
him
do
you
want
to
say
again
the
words
you
will
speak
to
sharp
knife
auguste
asked
yes
said
black
hawk
will
he
be
surprised
to
hear
me
speak
to
him
in
his
own
language
very
surprised
he
will
know
you
are
a
very
smart
man
haltingly
black
hawk
repeated
his
speech
in
english
which
auguste
had
at
the
chief
request
been
teaching
him
black
hawk
had
told
auguste
what
he
wanted
to
say
auguste
had
translated
it
and
the
old
leader
had
learned
it
word
by
word
smiling
owl
carver
said
this
is
just
what
your
vision
foretold
white
bear
that
black
hawk
would
speak
to
sharp
knife
in
sharp
knife
own
lodge
and
i
told
you
then
that
it
did
not
mean
black
hawk
would
conquer
sharp
but
auguste
did
not
have
the
heart
to
remind
owl
carver
of
the
unhappy
reality
silently
he
helped
the
reluctant
black
hawk
dress
he
wished
now
that
he
might
have
another
vision
of
the
future
beyond
this
moment
it
took
black
hawk
and
his
companions
two
days
to
travel
by
steamboat
from
fort
monroe
to
washington
city
as
the
meeting
with
sharp
knife
drew
closer
auguste
grew
more
and
more
fearful
if
jackson
and
black
hawk
quarreled
the
president
might
decide
to
throw
all
of
them
into
prison
for
life
he
might
even
have
them
quietly
killed
he
was
the
most
powerful
man
between
the
two
oceans
they
slept
overnight
in
the
ship
cabin
auguste
dreamed
that
he
stood
and
helpless
while
raoul
came
at
him
with
a
huge
dagger
the
next
day
at
about
nine
in
the
morning
black
hawk
and
his
three
advisors
were
riding
in
an
open
carriage
down
pennsylvania
avenue
with
columns
of
long
knives
four
abreast
on
horseback
before
and
behind
auguste
felt
bewildered
listening
to
the
rattle
of
hooves
only
a
few
moons
ago
the
long
knives
were
hunting
black
hawk
and
his
band
now
they
escorted
black
hawk
with
honor
the
change
was
dizzying
auguste
looked
about
him
curiously
at
the
capital
of
the
united
states
it
was
a
sprawl
of
large
brick
and
frame
houses
and
pennsylvania
avenue
was
a
muddy
deeply
rutted
thoroughfare
as
wide
as
a
cornfield
behind
them
on
its
hill
was
the
capitol
building
an
immense
square
stone
structure
topped
by
three
low
domes
the
air
was
thick
and
damp
and
hot
and
gray
clouds
lay
overhead
auguste
longed
for
the
drier
climate
of
illinois
pale
eyes
and
many
of
their
slaves
stood
under
the
poplar
trees
lining
the
sides
of
the
avenue
they
waved
cheerfully
to
black
hawk
and
clapped
their
hands
from
time
to
time
black
hawk
raised
a
hand
in
solemn
greeting
auguste
had
expected
that
they
would
have
to
endure
jeers
and
cries
of
hatred
when
they
were
paraded
through
washington
city
but
surprisingly
people
were
welcoming
them
as
if
they
were
heroes
it
gave
him
a
feeling
of
hope
his
people
might
learn
to
live
with
these
people
auguste
was
awed
by
the
size
of
the
president
house
three
or
four
times
bigger
than
victoire
it
stood
behind
an
iron
fence
at
the
western
end
of
pennsylvania
avenue
all
this
for
the
great
father
thought
auguste
it
seemed
all
the
more
impressive
because
the
entire
building
was
painted
white
among
the
sauk
colors
always
meant
something
auguste
asked
jefferson
davis
who
had
ridden
with
their
mounted
escort
what
the
white
of
the
president
house
meant
davis
smiled
wryly
why
that
to
hide
the
scorch
marks
from
where
the
redcoats
burned
it
in
but
how
fitting
it
seemed
that
the
great
father
of
the
white
people
should
live
in
a
white
palace
auguste
felt
a
tingle
of
excitement
as
the
officers
ushered
his
party
up
the
front
steps
owl
carver
stuck
his
hand
into
a
pocket
of
his
jacket
and
pulled
out
the
gold
watch
that
had
once
been
pierre
de
marion
he
smiled
toothless
at
auguste
you
told
me
i
could
use
this
to
tell
when
the
pale
eyes
will
do
things
see
now
one
of
the
long
knife
chiefs
told
me
this
he
pointed
to
the
face
of
the
watch
when
the
long
arrow
is
here
and
the
short
arrow
is
here
we
will
meet
with
sharp
knife
he
had
pointed
to
the
numerals
xii
and
xi
eleven
in
the
morning
they
awaited
sharp
knife
in
the
east
room
of
the
president
house
an
officer
told
the
four
sauk
to
stand
abreast
with
black
hawk
at
the
right
end
of
their
line
and
auguste
on
the
left
the
arrangement
told
auguste
that
the
long
knives
considered
him
the
least
important
member
of
the
sauk
delegation
an
estimate
with
which
he
agreed
a
dozen
long
knife
colonels
majors
captains
lieutenants
all
in
blue
jackets
and
gold
braid
stood
in
two
groups
flanking
the
sauk
even
though
he
had
never
had
any
reason
to
doubt
his
shaman
vision
auguste
was
surprised
at
how
exactly
he
had
seen
the
room
they
were
standing
in
its
rows
of
windows
with
blue
and
yellow
drapes
its
three
glittering
chandeliers
and
the
four
huge
mirrors
in
gilded
frames
facing
each
other
across
an
immense
blue
and
yellow
carpet
with
a
red
border
under
each
mirror
was
a
fireplace
four
fireplaces
to
keep
one
room
warm
in
winter
the
long
arrow
on
owl
carver
watch
had
moved
from
xii
to
vi
and
the
old
man
was
uttering
doubts
of
its
power
to
tell
him
anything
when
a
black
servant
opened
a
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
all
the
long
knives
in
the
room
drew
themselves
up
stiffly
clicking
their
heels
together
sharp
knife
came
slowly
into
the
room
andrew
jackson
in
person
looked
just
as
he
had
in
auguste
vision
only
more
terrifying
whatever
unknown
red
man
had
first
called
him
sharp
knife
had
chosen
aptly
with
his
long
narrow
face
and
his
extraordinarily
tall
thin
body
he
looked
like
a
blade
come
to
life
a
shock
of
white
hair
stood
up
as
stiff
as
wolf
paw
crest
on
top
of
his
head
and
thick
white
eyebrows
shadowed
eyes
as
bright
as
splinters
of
steel
raoul
words
of
over
a
year
ago
came
back
to
auguste
like
to
see
what
an
old
indian
killer
like
andy
jackson
would
say
to
auguste
felt
he
was
face
to
face
with
the
power
that
had
destroyed
the
sauk
this
man
with
his
own
hand
had
slain
indians
by
the
hundreds
had
uprooted
whole
nations
and
driven
them
westward
this
was
the
leader
of
those
endless
swarms
of
murderous
grasping
pale
eyes
who
territory
by
territory
were
driving
the
red
people
from
their
homes
this
was
the
man
who
willed
that
white
people
should
fill
all
the
land
from
ocean
to
ocean
but
sharp
knife
was
also
frail
as
an
icicle
he
moved
one
step
at
a
time
as
if
in
great
pain
and
auguste
sensed
that
he
was
afflicted
with
many
ailments
and
troubled
by
many
old
wounds
auguste
saw
in
him
an
immeasurably
powerful
spirit
that
kept
him
going
in
spite
of
so
much
sickness
and
pain
which
of
you
is
the
one
that
can
speak
english
jackson
asked
auguste
had
expected
his
voice
to
be
like
thunder
but
it
shrilled
like
a
knife
on
a
grindstone
feeling
a
painful
hollow
in
his
belly
auguste
said
i
am
mr
president
only
this
morning
davis
had
told
him
that
was
the
way
jackson
was
to
be
addressed
i
am
white
bear
also
called
auguste
de
marion
when
jackson
turned
his
gaze
on
him
auguste
felt
it
with
the
force
of
an
icy
gale
colonel
taylor
wrote
me
a
long
letter
about
you
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
later
now
tell
the
chief
i
am
happy
to
greet
him
as
a
friend
tell
him
there
will
be
peace
between
me
and
my
red
children
as
long
as
the
grass
shall
grow
and
the
rivers
shall
run
a
talk
later
what
did
jackson
have
in
mind
for
him
auguste
wondered
as
he
translated
for
black
hawk
now
shall
i
speak
to
him
in
his
tongue
black
hawk
asked
this
would
be
a
good
time
said
auguste
black
hawk
took
a
step
forward
leaving
owl
carver
flying
cloud
and
auguste
standing
behind
him
auguste
saw
that
black
hawk
was
shorter
than
jackson
but
broader
in
chest
and
shoulders
and
auguste
believed
stronger
and
healthier
though
they
were
about
the
same
age
black
hawk
raised
his
right
hand
in
greeting
and
said
in
english
i
am
a
man
and
you
are
a
man
like
me
jackson
looked
startled
then
stood
very
straight
and
stared
intently
at
black
hawk
bronze
face
as
the
war
leader
spoke
the
memorized
words
slowly
one
at
a
time
we
did
not
expect
to
conquer
your
people
i
took
up
the
tomahawk
to
avenge
great
wrongs
that
we
could
no
longer
bear
if
i
had
not
been
willing
to
fight
the
young
men
would
have
said
black
hawk
is
too
old
to
be
chief
they
would
have
said
black
hawk
is
a
woman
they
would
have
said
he
is
no
sauk
so
i
raised
the
war
whoop
you
are
a
war
leader
and
you
understand
me
i
need
say
no
more
i
ask
you
to
give
me
your
hand
in
friendship
and
to
let
us
return
to
our
people
a
very
fine
speech
said
jackson
i
was
not
told
that
you
spoke
english
chief
auguste
repeated
the
president
comment
in
sauk
black
hawk
said
tell
him
that
you
taught
me
how
to
say
what
i
wanted
to
say
in
the
pale
eyes
tongue
jackson
grunted
i
see
yes
white
bear
you
and
i
will
have
to
talk
well
tell
him
that
we
will
send
him
back
to
his
people
when
we
are
certain
we
have
no
more
trouble
from
them
auguste
wanted
to
say
all
the
people
who
caused
you
trouble
are
but
he
merely
translated
jackson
words
for
black
hawk
does
jackson
want
to
talk
to
me
auguste
did
not
like
the
sound
of
it
did
sharp
knife
have
in
mind
some
treachery
against
black
hawk
black
hawk
said
tell
the
great
father
that
the
sauk
will
be
quiet
as
long
as
the
pale
eyes
do
no
more
harm
to
them
auguste
had
a
sinking
feeling
as
he
translated
this
that
he
might
well
be
reopening
hostilities
right
here
in
the
president
house
jackson
answered
we
never
have
done
any
wrong
to
your
tribe
when
we
buy
land
from
people
we
expect
them
to
honor
their
agreements
stubborn
thought
auguste
black
hawk
was
right
in
saying
that
they
were
alike
when
he
told
black
hawk
what
jackson
had
said
the
chief
answered
say
to
him
that
i
have
thought
much
about
this
i
do
not
think
land
can
be
bought
and
sold
earthmaker
put
it
there
for
our
use
if
people
leave
their
land
then
someone
else
can
take
it
and
use
it
but
it
is
not
something
like
a
blanket
or
a
pot
that
can
be
carried
away
by
its
owner
it
belongs
to
all
earthmaker
children
black
hawk
words
worried
auguste
giving
him
the
feeling
that
a
storm
was
about
to
break
jackson
he
knew
was
a
man
a
man
who
had
killed
others
in
duels
black
hawk
might
be
bringing
further
trouble
on
himself
on
all
of
them
by
speaking
so
candidly
to
sharp
knife
he
considered
changing
black
hawk
words
to
a
speech
more
but
that
would
be
a
kind
of
treachery
he
decided
out
of
loyalty
to
black
hawk
he
must
convey
his
meaning
exactly
to
sharp
knife
so
watching
with
inner
trembling
as
jackson
frowned
and
shook
his
head
he
faithfully
translated
jackson
looked
directly
at
auguste
not
at
black
hawk
as
he
answered
you
indians
just
do
not
understand
that
land
is
the
source
of
all
the
goods
of
civilization
that
why
the
white
man
is
so
much
richer
and
more
powerful
than
the
red
man
among
us
every
piece
of
land
is
owned
by
a
particular
man
and
that
man
makes
good
use
of
his
land
to
produce
wealth
never
mind
do
translate
that
he
ordered
it
just
as
well
the
chief
and
i
have
no
more
words
on
this
point
right
now
auguste
felt
deep
relief
that
black
hawk
words
had
not
angered
jackson
unsmiling
the
president
took
a
stiff
step
toward
black
hawk
and
thrust
out
his
hand
black
hawk
reached
out
to
him
and
they
clasped
hands
solemnly
staring
into
each
other
eyes
auguste
felt
a
shiver
run
through
him
at
the
sight
of
that
handclasp
now
black
hawk
war
with
the
pale
eyes
was
truly
at
an
end
the
white
officers
standing
on
either
side
of
jackson
and
black
hawk
clapped
their
hands
and
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
auguste
owl
carver
and
the
winnebago
prophet
applauded
too
jackson
said
lieutenant
davis
take
the
chief
and
these
two
older
medicine
men
on
a
tour
of
the
president
house
and
the
gardens
he
turned
his
blue
eyes
on
auguste
white
bear
de
marion
i
like
you
to
accompany
me
to
my
office
for
a
private
word
now
auguste
heart
pounded
as
he
followed
jackson
accompanied
by
two
soldiers
up
a
flight
of
stairs
he
sensed
that
jackson
must
have
demands
in
mind
and
knew
that
because
of
what
he
had
been
indian
the
sauk
would
not
be
helped
by
his
yielding
to
those
demands
but
what
might
refusal
mean
imprisonment
death
jackson
office
was
a
large
room
well
lit
by
big
glass
windows
where
the
president
polished
oak
desk
was
piled
high
with
papers
the
two
soldiers
stationed
themselves
on
either
side
of
the
door
and
as
auguste
entered
behind
jackson
he
saw
a
guard
with
a
rifle
standing
like
a
wooden
statue
in
one
corner
of
the
room
auguste
wondered
whether
there
was
always
a
guard
there
or
only
when
jackson
had
an
indian
visitor
jackson
folded
his
tall
body
inch
by
painful
inch
into
a
large
mahogany
chair
with
a
gesture
he
invited
auguste
to
sit
opposite
him
in
a
comfortable
chair
with
curving
wooden
arms
and
legs
i
want
you
to
consider
staying
here
in
washington
city
de
marion
jackson
said
abruptly
i
think
you
can
be
of
great
service
to
your
indian
people
and
to
the
united
states
i
impressed
by
the
way
you
prepared
that
speech
for
black
hawk
zack
taylor
has
written
me
that
you
a
remarkably
learned
fellow
there
are
plenty
of
men
and
women
who
straddle
the
border
between
the
white
and
the
red
races
but
most
of
them
are
trash
illiterates
and
drunks
who
hang
around
army
posts
you
seem
to
be
an
important
man
both
in
the
white
world
and
among
your
fellow
tribesmen
auguste
body
went
cold
jackson
did
want
him
to
work
for
him
he
found
himself
resenting
the
president
apparent
expectation
that
he
could
easily
be
won
over
but
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
refused
outright
jackson
might
take
it
out
on
the
sauk
he
shook
his
head
you
overestimate
me
president
i
have
no
importance
in
the
white
world
i
had
a
place
but
it
was
taken
from
me
among
the
sauk
yes
i
am
what
you
would
call
a
medicine
man
but
i
begged
them
not
to
go
to
war
against
the
whites
and
they
did
not
listen
to
me
jackson
waved
that
away
with
a
long
bony
hand
i
can
see
that
you
are
capable
of
accomplishing
much
i
have
a
situation
for
you
in
my
bureau
of
indian
affairs
if
you
do
well
in
that
post
you
might
one
day
head
the
bureau
as
commissioner
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
all
the
indian
tribes
under
the
protection
of
the
united
states
auguste
felt
overwhelmed
jackson
proposal
went
far
beyond
anything
he
had
imagined
was
he
wrong
in
thinking
that
he
must
refuse
no
he
must
reject
jackson
offer
the
president
meant
to
use
him
against
his
own
people
auguste
looked
straight
into
jackson
eyes
you
expect
more
trouble
with
the
indians
do
you
mr
president
jackson
frowned
why
do
you
say
that
up
to
now
you
been
assuring
the
red
men
that
they
could
live
in
peace
on
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
but
now
you
ca
promise
them
that
anymore
you
a
medicine
man
de
marion
how
have
you
divined
that
auguste
felt
as
if
he
were
walking
on
bad
ice
and
might
at
any
moment
break
through
and
drown
he
should
not
be
so
bold
with
this
man
i
know
that
general
scott
has
signed
a
treaty
with
he
who
moves
alertly
whereby
the
sauk
give
up
a
strip
of
land
fifty
miles
wide
running
down
the
side
of
the
mississippi
jackson
clenched
his
fist
until
the
knuckles
showed
white
you
were
not
supposed
to
learn
about
that
treaty
till
you
returned
to
sauk
country
we
traveled
over
a
thousand
miles
president
we
talked
to
many
people
and
they
talked
to
us
and
with
someone
who
speaks
english
as
well
as
you
do
in
the
party
you
were
bound
to
learn
does
black
hawk
know
about
this
no
sir
jackson
smile
was
knowing
thinks
i
willing
to
betray
black
before
jackson
could
speak
auguste
said
he
would
be
angry
if
he
knew
he
would
protest
to
you
and
it
would
do
no
good
it
would
only
mar
the
meeting
between
you
and
him
sharp
knife
smile
broadened
exactly
the
sort
of
tactful
decision
expect
of
you
just
why
i
want
you
to
help
me
auguste
was
frightened
but
felt
he
must
make
it
clear
to
jackson
where
he
stood
president
when
you
force
the
red
people
to
give
up
land
west
of
the
great
river
how
will
they
live
soon
there
wo
be
enough
land
for
them
to
hunt
on
jackson
spread
his
hands
if
their
food
supply
runs
short
our
indian
agents
can
supply
them
until
they
find
other
means
of
livelihood
to
depend
on
government
agents
for
the
very
food
they
put
into
their
mouths
that
would
be
a
kind
of
prison
his
heart
galloping
auguste
decided
to
speak
even
more
boldly
you
are
looking
for
someone
to
reconcile
the
red
man
to
having
his
land
stolen
from
him
mr
president
de
marion
the
united
states
is
not
a
thief
a
fierce
glare
lit
jackson
eyes
must
try
to
be
bold
without
being
i
meant
no
insult
president
the
red
man
his
land
is
being
stolen
from
him
jackson
frowned
at
auguste
as
if
he
was
not
sure
whether
he
was
being
sarcastic
and
indeed
hearing
his
own
words
auguste
was
not
quite
sure
how
he
meant
them
exactly
jackson
said
the
red
man
does
understand
what
is
happening
you
can
help
to
see
that
this
be
auguste
hesitated
he
had
not
had
time
to
think
he
was
not
ready
to
decide
his
whole
future
and
perhaps
bargain
away
the
future
of
his
people
in
a
moment
staying
here
in
washington
city
just
might
be
the
best
thing
he
could
do
for
the
sauk
working
for
and
with
jackson
he
could
protect
his
people
warn
them
of
danger
avert
attacks
on
them
but
his
choosing
to
refuse
jackson
was
not
the
outcome
of
a
momentary
impulse
his
whole
life
had
taken
him
to
this
place
on
his
path
the
path
might
wind
its
direction
might
sometimes
be
lost
in
shadows
but
it
did
not
lead
to
sharp
knife
jackson
was
a
far
better
man
than
raoul
but
they
were
both
on
the
same
side
the
side
of
the
dispossessors
what
the
red
men
do
understand
president
is
how
much
they
are
giving
up
black
hawk
said
land
ca
be
bought
and
sold
jackson
said
then
it
belongs
to
whoever
can
make
the
best
use
of
it
each
man
owning
his
own
land
and
defending
it
against
all
comers
thought
auguste
that
was
the
centerpost
of
the
white
way
of
life
i
understand
that
you
feel
a
responsibility
to
your
people
to
provide
them
with
land
auguste
said
but
whether
it
is
legal
or
illegal
just
or
unjust
i
ca
help
you
to
move
my
people
or
any
other
red
people
off
the
land
they
are
living
on
jackson
face
seemed
to
sharpen
you
could
have
done
much
for
indians
by
working
for
me
i
surprised
that
a
man
of
your
intelligence
and
education
would
prefer
running
around
in
the
woods
wearing
a
loincloth
auguste
was
reminded
of
nancy
words
and
living
in
jackson
reached
into
an
inner
pocket
of
his
black
jacket
and
took
out
a
pair
of
spectacles
to
auguste
they
looked
somewhat
like
pierre
auguste
thought
with
sorrow
of
sun
woman
and
wondered
what
had
happened
to
the
spectacles
he
had
given
her
jackson
bent
forward
and
picked
up
a
sheet
of
paper
from
one
of
the
piles
on
his
desk
ask
one
of
the
soldiers
in
the
next
room
to
help
you
find
the
rest
of
your
party
a
few
days
later
jefferson
davis
came
to
see
auguste
in
his
new
room
a
small
chamber
in
one
of
the
towers
of
fort
monroe
i
see
they
moved
you
said
davis
with
a
smile
auguste
nodded
i
believe
president
jackson
prefers
that
i
no
longer
associate
with
black
hawk
and
his
party
seems
so
davis
said
president
jackson
plans
to
send
chief
black
hawk
and
owl
carver
and
the
prophet
on
a
tour
of
our
big
cities
jackson
up
for
reelection
next
month
and
of
course
he
wants
black
hawk
to
see
at
first
hand
what
he
up
against
the
president
has
made
it
clear
that
you
are
not
to
go
along
auguste
shrugged
he
offered
me
a
position
i
refused
a
smile
warmed
davis
pale
gaunt
face
people
do
ordinarily
say
no
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
well
you
go
home
all
the
sooner
black
hawk
and
the
others
wo
get
back
to
the
sauk
reservation
in
ioway
till
sometime
next
year
but
i
leaving
tomorrow
to
rejoin
zachary
taylor
command
at
fort
crawford
and
i
to
take
you
with
me
to
return
you
to
your
people
auguste
did
not
answer
he
sat
down
heavily
on
his
bed
which
he
had
pulled
next
to
the
one
small
window
in
his
room
overlooking
the
strait
called
hampton
roads
did
he
want
to
go
back
to
his
people
he
remembered
a
thought
that
had
come
to
him
while
talking
with
andrew
jackson
each
man
owning
his
own
land
that
was
the
key
to
the
white
way
of
life
but
he
longed
to
see
redbird
and
eagle
feather
again
were
they
well
or
sick
he
wanted
to
hold
redbird
in
his
arms
mourn
floating
lily
with
her
that
wonderful
story
he
had
heard
from
owl
carver
about
eagle
feather
and
the
calumet
he
wanted
to
tell
eagle
feather
he
had
done
well
but
go
back
to
the
sauk
he
knew
now
especially
after
talking
to
jackson
what
the
future
of
the
sauk
would
be
never
to
see
the
great
river
again
to
lose
their
land
bit
by
bit
to
be
confined
to
a
tract
of
land
in
ioway
far
smaller
than
the
territory
they
formerly
ranged
over
not
permitted
to
hunt
where
they
wished
might
have
to
beg
food
from
an
indian
agent
as
jackson
had
said
they
would
not
choose
their
own
chiefs
as
they
always
had
but
would
have
chiefs
picked
for
them
by
the
whites
men
like
he
who
moves
alertly
who
knew
how
to
use
both
the
pale
eyes
and
their
own
people
to
advance
themselves
a
miserable
life
a
prison
life
a
slave
life
memories
crowded
his
mind
the
words
of
the
turtle
will
be
guardian
of
that
land
that
has
been
placed
in
your
sun
lifeless
brown
eyes
staring
up
at
him
at
the
bad
axe
the
charred
ribs
of
victoire
under
a
moon
he
thought
of
the
endless
acres
of
farm
and
grazing
land
stretching
around
victoire
he
remembered
the
verdict
not
guilty
the
eyes
of
david
cooper
hard
but
honest
if
he
could
take
victoire
away
from
raoul
then
he
would
have
something
to
offer
redbird
and
eagle
feather
if
he
won
his
rightful
place
in
the
world
the
whites
were
building
he
could
bring
his
wife
and
son
to
share
it
with
him
what
the
matter
said
davis
breaking
in
on
his
thoughts
the
idea
of
going
back
to
your
people
make
you
happy
auguste
shook
his
head
no
what
other
choice
do
you
have
i
could
do
more
for
my
people
by
staying
in
the
white
world
not
as
jackson
judas
goat
but
as
master
of
victoire
davis
took
a
step
backward
astonished
master
of
victoire
have
you
lost
your
senses
man
we
barely
got
you
out
of
smith
county
alive
will
you
take
me
back
there
instead
of
to
the
sauk
in
ioway
davis
shook
his
head
i
not
authorized
to
do
that
am
i
still
a
prisoner
you
a
guest
of
uncle
sam
but
that
does
mean
i
can
spend
uncle
sam
money
taking
you
anywhere
you
want
to
go
davis
frowned
in
thought
but
i
could
turn
you
loose
in
galena
instead
of
taking
you
all
the
way
over
to
ioway
that
would
make
any
difference
monetarily
not
that
i
ready
to
go
along
with
this
but
could
you
manage
to
make
it
to
victor
from
there
i
write
to
my
grandfather
and
ask
him
to
send
a
horse
to
galena
for
me
if
your
grandfather
has
any
sense
he
tell
you
to
get
the
hell
across
the
mississippi
to
the
sauk
reservation
my
grandfather
has
a
power
of
sense
but
he
also
loves
me
and
will
want
to
see
me
again
if
you
show
your
face
in
victor
you
be
swinging
from
a
tree
limb
before
the
sun
sets
not
if
i
can
take
raoul
by
surprise
davis
shook
his
head
this
is
wrong
i
letting
you
go
to
your
death
frightened
seeing
his
plan
through
davis
eyes
auguste
was
tempted
to
change
his
mind
yes
go
back
to
ioway
live
safely
in
the
warm
heart
of
the
tribe
why
face
a
mob
of
bullies
led
by
raoul
it
was
hopeless
he
would
surely
die
but
he
saw
again
those
rolling
acres
the
great
house
rebuilt
the
wealth
and
what
he
could
do
with
it
if
he
turned
his
back
on
that
he
would
stunt
the
rest
of
his
life
with
regret
and
longing
he
said
it
not
suicide
i
risking
my
life
yes
but
if
i
do
try
to
right
the
wrong
that
has
been
done
to
me
life
will
not
be
worth
living
davis
sighed
a
man
has
to
stand
up
for
what
he
believes
in
even
if
it
looks
like
a
lost
cause
i
guess
that
what
you
and
black
hawk
and
all
your
people
have
been
doing
all
along
now
that
auguste
was
committed
fear
came
back
he
have
to
face
raoul
men
dozens
of
them
alone
even
the
bear
spirit
could
not
give
him
the
strength
and
skill
to
do
that
there
must
be
a
way
to
meet
raoul
alone
ambush
him
but
that
way
even
if
he
succeeded
in
killing
raoul
the
town
and
raoul
friends
would
never
accept
him
as
master
of
victoire
the
man
he
just
met
andrew
jackson
was
well
known
as
a
duelist
in
his
years
at
victoire
auguste
had
heard
more
than
once
of
raoul
meeting
men
in
single
combat
pierre
and
elysée
had
spoken
with
disgust
of
raoul
dozen
or
more
killings
a
duel
that
would
be
the
way
to
do
it
if
he
succeeded
in
killing
raoul
in
a
duel
no
one
would
try
to
stop
him
from
retaking
victoire
with
raoul
gone
his
men
would
be
leaderless
of
course
raoul
had
killed
many
men
and
auguste
had
killed
none
but
the
bear
spirit
would
fight
on
auguste
side
and
if
he
failed
he
would
rather
die
fighting
for
what
was
rightfully
his
than
spend
his
life
drinking
the
bitter
water
of
defeat
a
few
days
before
he
left
fort
monroe
auguste
persuaded
davis
to
let
him
be
allowed
to
walk
on
the
parade
ground
at
the
same
time
as
owl
carver
a
sadness
came
over
him
at
the
sight
of
the
old
shaman
a
gray
army
blanket
thrown
over
his
shoulders
despite
the
warmth
of
the
day
walking
with
stiff
steps
across
the
grass
the
eyes
did
not
light
up
with
recognition
until
auguste
came
close
to
him
then
owl
carver
took
both
auguste
hands
in
his
and
auguste
noticed
something
he
had
never
seen
before
the
sudden
realization
awed
him
eyes
look
so
much
like
those
of
the
turtle
wondering
how
owl
carver
would
think
of
what
he
was
doing
he
told
him
i
am
going
back
to
the
pale
eyes
town
back
to
star
arrow
home
i
mean
to
try
to
take
back
the
land
from
my
uncle
owl
carver
closed
those
ancient
eyes
he
spoke
after
a
hesitation
and
when
he
did
his
voice
frightened
auguste
it
was
the
eerie
singsong
voice
he
used
when
he
was
prophesying
for
the
tribe
when
a
man
or
woman
suffers
an
injury
too
great
for
them
to
bear
an
evil
spirit
is
born
in
them
a
spirit
of
hate
the
evil
spirit
ruins
whoever
harbors
it
the
evil
spirit
occupies
a
man
and
drives
him
onward
until
he
does
things
to
others
that
make
them
hate
in
their
turn
and
thus
the
spirit
continues
i
think
your
uncle
has
been
carrying
such
an
evil
spirit
auguste
broke
out
in
a
cold
sweat
hearing
the
warning
in
owl
words
he
remembered
the
hatred
that
rose
in
him
whenever
he
thought
of
raoul
was
the
spirit
of
hatred
kindled
in
raoul
at
fort
dearborn
now
passing
to
him
i
pledged
to
my
father
smoking
the
sacred
tobacco
that
i
would
hold
the
land
he
gave
me
auguste
said
as
much
to
hearten
himself
as
to
persuade
owl
carver
tobacco
bound
you
and
black
hawk
in
honor
to
surrender
when
eagle
feather
smoked
it
i
must
honor
my
promise
but
he
still
felt
cold
within
as
owl
carver
his
eyes
now
and
grave
gripped
his
wrist
tightly
do
not
let
your
uncle
evil
spirit
cross
over
to
you
see
that
it
be
your
promise
and
not
greed
like
the
greed
of
the
pale
eyes
that
takes
you
back
to
that
land
and
above
all
do
not
use
your
shaman
power
to
harm
your
enemy
or
you
will
suffer
for
it
i
will
not
said
auguste
but
he
felt
unsure
of
himself
after
all
the
evil
he
had
endured
how
could
he
that
he
would
not
unleash
his
greatest
powers
if
that
were
the
only
way
he
could
destroy
raoul
the
grip
of
the
bony
fingers
on
his
wrist
tightened
set
your
heart
white
bear
not
upon
getting
back
this
land
but
just
upon
walking
your
path
the
deep
lines
in
owl
carver
face
were
drawn
downward
with
pain
and
auguste
felt
the
crushing
weight
of
grief
as
he
realized
they
were
both
thinking
the
same
thought
that
they
would
never
see
each
other
again
challenge
following
the
dimly
seen
figures
of
guichard
and
his
horse
auguste
breathlessly
climbed
a
narrow
steep
pathway
that
switched
back
and
forth
up
the
steep
wooded
hillside
he
led
his
horse
by
the
reins
halfway
up
the
hill
they
came
to
a
flat
place
an
open
clearing
auguste
smelled
wood
smoke
the
windows
of
a
cottage
glowed
yellow
promising
safety
while
auguste
waited
in
the
dark
guichard
stabled
the
horses
then
knocked
on
the
cottage
door
we
have
arrived
monsieur
he
called
and
pushed
the
door
inward
auguste
blinked
in
the
light
of
a
dozen
candles
set
on
a
circular
chandelier
across
the
room
by
the
fireplace
a
book
fell
to
the
rug
a
kentucky
quilt
was
swept
back
and
a
pair
of
long
skinny
legs
draped
in
a
nightshirt
swung
over
the
side
of
a
chaise
longue
grandpapa
do
get
up
but
elysée
was
already
hobbling
across
the
room
to
auguste
outstretched
arms
elysée
buried
his
white
head
in
his
grandson
chest
auguste
held
his
grandfather
tightly
the
answering
embrace
was
not
as
strong
as
it
had
been
even
a
few
months
ago
when
the
old
man
had
visited
him
in
his
cell
the
fragility
and
weakness
saddened
auguste
bare
feet
peeping
from
under
another
nightshirt
pattered
down
a
ladder
from
the
loft
before
he
reached
the
bottom
woodrow
jumped
and
rushed
to
hug
auguste
i
been
staying
here
ever
since
we
found
out
you
were
coming
so
i
could
tell
miss
nancy
right
away
when
you
got
here
nancy
his
heart
raced
as
he
remembered
her
in
the
witness
chair
defending
him
and
standing
up
to
raoul
abuse
he
badly
wanted
to
see
her
to
hold
her
in
his
arms
but
could
he
allow
himself
to
feel
so
much
for
nancy
when
he
hoped
to
bring
redbird
here
is
looking
too
far
down
the
trail
i
may
not
live
to
see
redbird
out
there
in
the
dark
the
enemy
might
be
gathering
even
now
you
still
live
with
miss
nancy
woodrow
she
adopted
me
the
boy
stared
down
at
elysée
small
chinese
rug
i
guess
that
makes
me
your
son
too
auguste
understood
what
woodrow
meant
auguste
had
taken
nancy
as
his
wife
according
to
sauk
custom
and
woodrow
knew
it
he
saw
puzzled
look
and
knew
that
he
might
have
difficulty
explaining
later
but
he
must
not
hesitate
now
he
squeezed
woodrow
bony
shoulder
i
proud
i
proud
of
you
white
bear
i
glad
you
came
back
i
off
to
miss
nancy
soon
as
i
get
my
britches
on
the
boy
scampered
back
up
the
ladder
guichard
go
get
nicole
and
frank
said
elysée
as
he
drew
auguste
across
the
room
and
gently
pushed
him
into
a
chair
they
be
sleeping
grandpapa
auguste
protested
they
would
be
furious
if
we
did
not
wake
them
said
elysée
his
falcon
face
severe
and
it
is
safest
that
we
meet
late
at
night
auguste
wondered
was
any
time
safe
did
not
the
enemy
have
eyes
and
ears
for
the
night
auguste
threw
off
the
riding
coat
guichard
had
given
him
in
galena
and
sat
down
in
a
straight
wooden
chair
by
the
chaise
longue
close
to
the
welcome
warmth
of
the
fire
he
noticed
a
pistol
and
a
rifle
mounted
on
brackets
over
the
mantel
with
two
powder
horns
hanging
beside
them
guichard
filled
three
small
glasses
with
an
inch
of
brandy
apiece
drained
one
quickly
and
left
the
other
two
and
the
decanter
on
a
small
table
within
easy
reach
i
felt
ten
years
younger
when
i
saw
raoul
face
turn
purple
when
he
came
into
court
with
his
rogues
and
heard
that
you
had
been
spirited
away
elysée
wiped
his
wet
cheeks
with
a
blue
kerchief
i
cry
so
easily
i
getting
old
i
am
crying
too
grandpapa
elysée
turned
a
stern
but
still
moist
eye
on
him
enough
crying
then
tell
me
everything
you
have
seen
and
done
since
the
trial
auguste
described
his
journey
to
washington
city
and
the
meeting
with
andrew
jackson
woodrow
dressed
now
for
riding
lingered
to
listen
as
auguste
repeated
black
hawk
speech
to
jackson
then
he
solemnly
shook
hands
with
auguste
and
left
be
careful
out
there
auguste
called
after
him
elysée
said
president
jackson
what
sort
of
man
is
he
his
nickname
old
hickory
is
apt
he
hard
very
hard
auguste
told
about
his
refusal
of
jackson
offer
of
a
post
and
being
cut
out
of
black
hawk
touring
party
elysée
shook
his
head
doubtfully
to
take
a
position
in
the
government
might
have
opened
up
an
excellent
career
for
you
auguste
shook
his
head
i
knew
what
jackson
wanted
to
use
me
for
the
bear
spirit
would
tear
my
heart
out
if
i
ever
consented
elysée
raised
an
eyebrow
you
still
believe
in
such
things
bear
spirits
and
all
that
auguste
thought
of
his
resolve
to
succeed
as
a
white
man
even
so
the
bear
spirit
was
as
real
as
his
grandfather
i
do
just
believe
grandpapa
i
know
elysée
reply
was
cut
off
when
a
weeping
nicole
pushed
the
door
open
followed
by
frank
and
guichard
auguste
held
his
aunt
in
his
arms
rejoicing
in
the
strength
he
felt
in
her
ample
body
guichard
brought
more
chairs
from
a
rear
room
and
set
them
close
to
the
fire
they
sat
in
a
circle
their
backs
to
the
dark
outside
all
this
going
from
house
to
house
is
safe
said
nicole
raoul
is
probably
having
all
of
us
watched
he
wo
feel
he
really
owns
victoire
as
long
as
auguste
is
alive
frank
said
he
might
know
that
president
jackson
sent
you
back
from
washington
city
we
been
getting
regular
reports
from
back
east
about
chief
black
hawk
tour
and
your
name
was
mentioned
do
you
have
any
news
about
the
rest
of
my
people
auguste
asked
nicole
said
the
sauk
prisoners
who
walked
through
here
are
being
held
at
rock
island
auguste
said
i
must
go
there
and
find
redbird
and
eagle
feather
hearing
that
she
was
still
in
illinois
he
wanted
more
than
ever
to
rescue
her
from
hunger
and
fear
and
captivity
to
bring
her
and
eagle
feather
here
to
victoire
i
live
to
do
will
you
join
the
other
sauk
in
ioway
after
you
find
your
family
frank
asked
auguste
shook
his
head
no
i
must
take
my
rightful
place
here
i
can
no
longer
live
as
a
sauk
if
we
are
to
live
and
prosper
we
must
live
as
the
whites
do
each
man
holding
and
tending
his
own
land
i
want
to
show
my
people
how
it
can
be
done
i
want
to
take
victoire
back
a
silence
filled
the
room
a
log
on
the
fire
broke
in
two
with
a
loud
crack
spattering
sparks
on
the
screen
auguste
looked
at
each
of
them
in
turn
there
was
worry
in
eyes
nicole
full
face
was
pale
with
fear
and
frank
looked
bewildered
guichard
standing
against
the
wall
sipped
brandy
frank
said
but
raoul
he
try
to
kill
you
i
mean
to
let
him
try
i
mean
to
challenge
him
you
ca
nicole
voice
was
shrill
he
got
dozens
of
men
behind
him
he
will
have
to
fight
me
man
to
man
raoul
can
hold
his
place
only
as
long
as
his
followers
think
he
is
the
strongest
and
bravest
they
respect
him
the
way
they
used
to
he
made
too
many
mistakes
and
some
of
those
mistakes
have
cost
lives
among
his
own
men
if
he
tries
to
kill
me
without
fighting
me
he
slip
further
in
their
eyes
if
he
loses
the
respect
of
his
men
he
loses
everything
nicole
said
but
you
going
up
against
someone
who
has
killed
many
times
and
he
killed
iron
knife
the
biggest
and
strongest
brave
in
the
british
i
must
do
this
said
auguste
i
have
never
killed
but
i
know
how
to
use
weapons
i
must
do
it
for
my
mother
for
all
the
sauk
that
he
has
killed
and
so
that
my
father
will
may
be
done
i
believe
the
bear
spirit
will
help
me
he
hoped
he
sounded
more
confident
than
he
felt
if
he
let
these
people
persuade
him
he
might
give
up
and
run
away
elysée
groaned
the
bear
spirit
again
auguste
think
how
many
men
have
gone
into
battle
believing
god
and
the
saints
and
the
angels
would
help
them
and
have
died
auguste
wished
he
could
explain
maybe
for
white
men
the
spirits
did
not
exist
but
he
knew
that
his
visions
were
real
the
bear
spirit
was
not
just
another
part
of
his
mind
it
had
a
life
of
its
own
it
had
left
the
marks
of
its
claws
on
his
body
it
had
left
its
paw
print
in
the
earth
beside
pierre
body
when
it
took
his
spirit
away
if
it
was
wrong
for
me
to
try
to
fight
raoul
grandpapa
i
would
receive
a
warning
elysée
shook
his
head
sadly
disbelieving
auguste
was
sad
too
thinking
how
much
more
there
was
to
the
world
than
grandpapa
would
ever
let
himself
know
the
seth
thomas
clock
on
the
mantel
over
the
fireplace
chimed
once
making
them
all
jump
one
in
the
morning
auguste
at
the
end
of
a
journey
by
railroad
steamboat
coach
and
horseback
that
had
taken
weeks
felt
a
ache
of
exhaustion
but
it
was
only
bodily
fatigue
now
that
he
was
in
victor
he
was
excited
and
his
mind
was
wide
awake
frank
put
an
hand
on
auguste
shoulder
listen
auguste
even
if
you
were
to
succeed
in
killing
raoul
you
would
get
victoire
back
why
not
things
have
changed
around
here
people
do
hold
with
the
idea
that
every
man
should
carry
a
gun
and
be
a
law
unto
himself
they
seen
that
only
leads
to
a
gang
like
raoul
and
his
rogues
running
things
they
decided
they
wanted
the
county
run
by
those
they
picked
and
men
like
david
cooper
and
tom
slattery
came
forward
slattery
is
our
new
sheriff
elysée
said
the
has
had
much
to
do
with
this
change
frank
shrugged
modestly
and
went
on
right
after
your
trial
a
group
of
men
in
victor
and
on
the
farms
hereabouts
mostly
newcomers
formed
an
organization
called
the
regulators
they
said
it
was
a
disgrace
that
the
army
had
to
guard
you
during
your
trial
and
that
you
had
to
flee
from
the
town
when
it
was
over
they
determined
to
keep
order
in
smith
county
and
slattery
has
sworn
them
all
in
as
deputies
to
make
what
they
do
legal
things
are
tense
now
between
the
regulators
and
raoul
men
but
the
regulators
have
more
numbers
and
more
spirit
well
then
said
auguste
exasperated
why
would
these
regulators
support
me
if
i
kill
raoul
because
dueling
is
against
the
law
you
stand
trial
again
for
murder
and
by
god
much
as
it
might
pain
him
cooper
will
hang
you
and
if
you
do
kill
raoul
said
nicole
you
die
and
he
will
still
have
victoire
auguste
felt
as
if
he
were
struggling
in
a
net
of
heavy
ropes
his
hands
and
heart
ached
for
revenge
on
raoul
even
if
he
did
not
get
victoire
back
but
that
was
madness
to
kill
raoul
and
be
hanged
for
it
what
can
i
do
then
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
nicole
said
david
cooper
still
has
the
papers
that
prove
pierre
adopted
you
and
left
victoire
to
you
for
just
a
moment
auguste
felt
his
burden
of
fear
grow
lighter
he
would
fight
raoul
in
a
courtroom
no
one
need
die
but
no
he
waved
the
idea
away
they
acquitted
me
of
murder
but
a
jury
of
new
settlers
in
illinois
is
not
likely
to
make
an
indian
the
biggest
landholder
in
the
county
nicole
said
they
would
because
they
would
know
that
if
they
found
for
you
and
against
raoul
they
would
be
finding
for
the
whole
family
not
just
you
auguste
said
even
if
i
could
get
a
fair
trial
i
would
live
to
hear
the
verdict
yes
you
would
said
frank
fear
of
the
regulators
would
stop
raoul
from
murdering
you
auguste
felt
the
ropy
net
tightening
three
moons
ago
his
life
had
been
in
the
hands
of
twelve
white
men
now
frank
was
asking
him
to
trust
unknown
white
men
again
and
again
it
seemed
he
had
no
choice
is
there
nothing
else
i
can
do
the
words
came
out
as
a
cry
of
pain
you
said
you
want
to
live
as
whites
do
said
frank
then
you
have
to
start
to
think
and
act
like
a
civilized
white
man
seek
your
remedy
in
the
law
more
than
once
auguste
thought
he
seen
that
civilized
white
men
were
as
quick
to
flout
the
law
as
to
seek
a
remedy
in
it
but
resigned
he
slumped
in
his
chair
his
hands
hanging
down
between
his
knees
i
will
follow
your
advice
nicole
came
over
to
him
and
stroked
his
hair
we
be
beside
you
every
moment
auguste
the
menace
of
rope
or
bullet
or
knife
seemed
driven
off
a
bit
as
guichard
put
another
log
on
the
fire
and
they
began
to
talk
about
going
to
vandalia
finding
a
lawyer
perhaps
thomas
ford
again
and
filing
suit
against
raoul
there
was
still
the
possibility
the
likelihood
of
failure
but
at
least
he
might
come
through
alive
the
clock
struck
two
a
sharp
banging
on
the
door
startled
auguste
everyone
fell
silent
dreading
what
might
be
out
there
guichard
went
to
the
door
opened
it
a
crack
then
pulled
it
wide
auguste
saw
a
flash
of
blond
hair
under
a
bonnet
and
eyes
of
deepest
blue
the
sudden
leap
of
his
heart
lifted
him
out
of
his
chair
he
barely
heard
the
little
serving
table
beside
him
topple
over
spilling
his
brandy
he
ran
to
nancy
holding
out
his
arms
the
lenses
on
the
desk
stared
accusingly
up
at
raoul
do
i
keep
taking
them
out
and
looking
at
them
it
was
like
picking
at
a
scab
making
it
bleed
over
and
over
again
so
that
the
wound
never
healed
with
a
gentle
hand
he
closed
the
silver
case
he
had
long
since
cleaned
and
polished
it
but
he
still
remembered
it
as
he
had
first
seen
it
streaked
with
the
blood
of
the
indian
woman
he
had
just
killed
he
put
the
case
in
his
desk
drawer
armand
perrault
sitting
across
the
desk
from
raoul
grunted
with
disgust
ignoring
him
raoul
picked
up
his
whiskey
glass
and
sipped
from
it
running
the
tip
of
his
tongue
over
the
ends
of
his
mustache
why
do
you
get
rid
of
those
damned
spectacles
armand
said
as
he
refilled
his
glass
from
raoul
jug
when
armand
picked
up
his
glass
it
left
a
wet
ring
that
would
stain
the
polished
maple
surface
there
were
already
many
rings
on
the
desk
even
though
it
had
been
shipped
out
from
philadelphia
only
two
months
ago
they
looked
like
owl
eyes
staring
as
the
spectacles
stared
but
raoul
could
bring
himself
to
care
about
how
his
desk
looked
just
as
he
could
care
enough
to
get
started
on
rebuilding
victoire
he
preferred
to
live
at
the
trading
post
he
had
felt
like
doing
anything
ever
since
auguste
second
escape
from
victor
next
spring
he
told
himself
he
get
the
work
going
and
so
he
sat
up
late
every
night
in
his
counting
room
with
armand
and
they
drank
and
told
each
other
the
same
stories
about
the
war
with
black
hawk
band
there
were
men
to
drink
with
in
the
trading
post
taproom
but
he
did
care
for
most
of
them
armand
had
been
with
him
longer
than
anybody
raoul
might
not
like
him
much
but
he
was
used
to
him
armand
had
grudgingly
accepted
raoul
explanation
that
he
had
read
his
copy
of
the
will
carefully
before
sticking
it
in
the
fire
he
thanked
raoul
for
the
belated
two
hundred
dollars
and
dismissed
generosity
as
an
attempted
bribe
from
beyond
the
grave
raoul
stared
at
his
stained
desk
the
drawer
was
still
open
the
silver
case
still
visible
they
were
my
brother
spectacles
i
know
that
why
do
you
keep
them
you
hated
your
brother
raoul
brought
the
flat
of
his
hand
heavily
down
on
the
desk
shut
up
you
know
nothing
about
it
do
i
feel
about
pierre
do
i
still
love
him
in
a
way
is
that
why
i
keep
his
spectacles
unwilling
suddenly
to
consign
the
silver
case
to
his
desk
he
dropped
it
into
his
jacket
pocket
armand
probably
wanted
him
to
throw
it
away
so
he
could
retrieve
the
case
and
sell
it
for
the
silver
armand
said
your
brother
put
the
horns
on
me
and
his
injun
friends
killed
my
wife
mon
dieu
how
i
wanted
to
see
that
bastard
son
of
his
hang
for
that
raoul
was
tired
of
hearing
armand
go
on
about
dead
marchette
to
whom
he
given
nothing
but
blows
and
contempt
when
she
was
alive
going
to
bed
with
pierre
was
the
only
good
thing
that
ever
happened
to
that
poor
woman
but
he
said
nothing
after
all
he
himself
had
cared
little
enough
for
clarissa
when
she
was
alive
you
get
a
chance
to
kill
him
yet
said
raoul
he
be
back
this
way
it
was
now
nearly
a
week
since
the
sergeant
at
fort
crawford
in
pay
passed
the
word
that
andrew
jackson
had
sent
the
mongrel
back
west
to
think
that
vermin
meeting
the
president
if
auguste
traveled
as
fast
as
the
news
he
must
be
nearly
here
informant
said
that
auguste
was
supposed
to
be
sent
with
a
military
escort
to
the
new
sauk
reservation
in
ioway
raoul
was
sure
auguste
would
come
to
victor
instead
when
auguste
came
back
to
victor
he
would
go
at
once
to
nancy
cabin
or
send
for
her
surely
she
had
lied
in
court
about
what
she
and
auguste
were
to
each
other
the
boys
raoul
had
sent
to
watch
her
cabin
would
let
him
know
of
auguste
arrival
armand
nodded
vigorously
may
le
bon
dieu
grant
me
the
chance
to
kill
him
but
what
makes
you
so
sure
he
will
come
here
because
he
knows
that
he
can
prove
pierre
left
victoire
to
him
cooper
has
those
papers
and
cooper
helped
him
escape
so
he
has
cooper
on
his
side
armand
said
two
pieces
of
paper
easy
enough
to
make
them
disappear
how
in
hell
am
i
going
to
get
them
away
from
cooper
him
and
his
regulators
glowering
at
raoul
armand
leaned
back
in
his
chair
making
it
creak
he
folded
his
hands
across
the
big
belly
that
stretched
his
homespun
shirt
kill
cooper
and
there
will
be
no
more
regulators
i
wish
i
pouring
himself
another
drink
raoul
said
armand
you
damn
near
as
stupid
as
an
indian
armand
eyes
narrowed
and
for
a
moment
raoul
saw
a
flash
of
hatred
that
reminded
him
of
the
way
the
overseer
used
to
look
at
pierre
have
a
care
how
you
talk
to
me
mon
colonel
armand
said
in
a
voice
that
sounded
like
millstones
grinding
together
i
am
your
one
friend
otto
wegner
and
eli
greenglove
turned
on
you
hodge
hode
is
dead
levi
pope
has
joined
the
regulators
true
i
have
no
other
friends
but
armand
i
have
no
family
happened
to
me
damn
it
it
plain
stupid
to
talk
about
fighting
the
regulators
armand
kill
cooper
and
we
have
a
countywide
war
on
our
hands
i
believe
we
could
frighten
the
regulators
into
backing
down
mon
colonel
if
showed
some
courage
a
jab
at
whiskey
and
anger
almost
made
raoul
lash
out
again
at
armand
but
he
felt
a
sudden
fear
that
armand
would
turn
on
him
and
he
would
be
all
alone
raoul
brooded
for
a
time
then
finally
spoke
wait
till
i
get
the
lead
mine
opened
up
next
spring
we
go
up
to
galena
you
and
i
and
we
recruit
the
roughest
meanest
miners
we
can
find
and
we
make
it
plain
to
them
that
they
have
two
jobs
to
dig
for
lead
and
to
fight
regulators
when
we
got
enough
of
them
down
here
we
take
on
cooper
and
his
crowd
in
the
next
election
spread
whiskey
and
money
around
and
our
boys
will
beat
up
anybody
who
says
he
wo
vote
our
way
smith
county
will
belong
to
us
again
armand
he
heard
hurried
footsteps
echoing
on
the
floor
of
the
main
room
someone
rapped
on
his
office
door
like
a
swimmer
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
a
lake
after
a
dive
raoul
rose
up
out
of
his
comfortable
whiskey
haze
who
there
he
growled
josiah
hode
a
skinny
youth
in
dark
calico
shirt
and
workman
trousers
a
big
hunting
knife
at
his
waist
pushed
the
door
open
hodge
orphaned
son
is
what
my
andy
and
phil
would
have
grown
to
look
the
thought
hurt
raoul
because
andy
and
phil
were
dead
and
because
he
had
never
really
loved
them
what
is
it
josiah
someone
rode
up
to
miz
hale
door
and
banged
on
it
i
snuck
right
up
to
the
fence
when
they
came
out
i
saw
it
was
that
woodrow
kid
that
lives
with
her
and
she
got
out
her
own
horse
and
rode
toward
town
with
him
did
you
follow
them
long
enough
to
see
that
they
went
up
to
old
de
marion
place
there
raoul
said
he
felt
as
if
he
were
out
hunting
on
a
frosty
morning
and
had
just
sighted
a
buck
with
spreading
antlers
he
clenched
his
fist
and
brought
it
down
on
his
desk
hard
he
opened
the
drawer
again
took
out
a
small
bag
of
coins
and
slammed
the
drawer
shut
he
counted
out
nine
spanish
dollars
josiah
you
divide
these
between
the
three
of
you
for
keeping
good
watch
he
dropped
a
tenth
piece
of
eight
into
the
boy
cupped
hands
that
for
you
for
bringing
me
the
good
news
josiah
grinned

twenty
men

round
them
up
have
them
meet
me
at
the
trading
post
gate
très
bon
mon
colonel
raoul
thought
a
moment
he
had
planned
to
hang
auguste
but
they
could
leave
a
body
around
for
the
regulators
to
find
we
take
him
out
to
the
lead
mine
and
finish
him
there
i
know
parts
of
that
mine
where
nobody
ever
find
anything
can
i
come
de
marion
josiah
asked
the
glow
of
admiration
in
his
eyes
warmed
raoul
raoul
gave
the
boy
a
grin
sure
josiah
bring
your
dad
rifle
show
you
how
smith
county
takes
care
of
its
indian
problem
do
nicole
and
grandpapa
know
about
us
auguste
asked
nancy
as
they
sat
side
by
side
on
the
fence
guichard
had
built
around
garden
i
told
nicole
she
said
i
was
afraid
she
condemn
me
but
i
had
to
confide
in
someone
she
was
very
sweet
to
me
about
it
not
a
hint
of
reproach
nicole
understands
his
voice
sounded
choked
he
did
know
how
he
knew
nicole
that
well
from
glances
from
hints
in
her
voice
perhaps
but
he
was
sure
that
her
own
desires
were
as
large
as
she
was
and
her
generosity
larger
still
she
would
feel
nothing
but
goodwill
toward
another
woman
longing
for
a
man
nancy
put
her
hand
on
auguste
and
his
breath
quickened
her
face
seemed
to
pull
his
eyes
and
he
saw
in
the
light
of
the
waxing
moon
that
she
was
more
beautiful
tonight
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
her
cheeks
were
rounder
now
he
had
fully
realized
how
haggard
she
had
been
as
a
captive
of
the
sauk
all
looked
like
buzzards
meals
but
even
then
i
loved
to
look
at
right
now
he
felt
the
blood
throbbing
in
his
body
he
wanted
to
pick
her
up
and
carry
her
into
the
woods
beyond
the
house
and
be
upon
her
as
any
healthy
sauk
husband
and
wife
would
greet
each
other
after
a
long
time
apart
he
was
so
aware
of
his
hunger
for
nancy
and
hers
for
him
that
he
could
hardly
think
of
anything
else
their
need
lit
up
the
little
garden
with
a
glow
brighter
than
the
moon
but
what
of
redbird
even
though
she
accepted
nancy
as
truly
his
wife
as
much
as
herself
somehow
it
did
not
seem
right
for
him
to
love
nancy
now
it
had
been
right
when
they
were
living
with
the
british
band
here
in
victor
it
was
not
right
i
knew
you
would
come
back
nancy
said
sensing
his
desire
but
not
his
hesitancy
bringing
her
lips
so
close
to
his
he
could
almost
taste
them
he
inched
away
from
her
so
as
not
to
be
utterly
overcome
by
her
nearness
he
decided
to
talk
of
other
things
he
told
her
of
the
plan
he
had
come
here
with
to
challenge
raoul
he
told
her
how
frank
had
persuaded
him
to
try
to
retake
victoire
with
the
law
help
the
turtle
has
said
that
i
must
be
guardian
of
the
land
and
see
to
it
that
no
pale
eyes
prospers
by
stealing
from
the
sauk
he
said
if
i
can
take
victoire
back
from
raoul
my
people
will
have
a
place
to
come
to
in
the
land
that
was
once
theirs
you
mean
for
the
tribe
to
come
back
and
live
on
the
estate
no
they
could
never
come
back
to
illinois
as
a
tribe
but
families
could
come
and
live
here
for
a
while
they
could
send
their
children
here
they
could
learn
our
ways
and
the
wealth
of
the
estate
could
help
them
wherever
they
might
be
will
you
bring
redbird
and
eagle
feather
here
she
asked
squeezing
his
hand
she
want
me
to
say
i
wo
no
she
cares
for
them
too
we
were
a
he
said
yes
if
i
can
get
victoire
away
from
raoul
i
will
bring
them
here
he
saw
her
eyes
close
and
knew
that
he
was
hurting
her
and
that
deepened
his
own
pain
still
more
she
let
go
his
hand
and
twisted
her
fingers
together
in
her
lap
of
course
redbird
is
first
in
your
heart
but
how
can
she
live
here
with
you
where
her
baby
was
torn
out
of
her
arms
and
killed
by
a
mob
of
white
people
i
asked
myself
that
many
times
i
will
have
to
hear
what
redbird
says
he
remembered
what
sun
woman
had
said
when
pierre
asked
her
to
come
with
him
to
victoire
could
not
look
into
pale
eyes
faces
all
day
long
my
heart
would
dry
and
surely
redbird
had
more
reason
to
hate
the
sight
of
white
faces
than
sun
woman
had
seven
years
ago
could
he
himself
live
here
he
talked
about
retaking
victoire
about
living
as
a
white
man
but
he
recalled
the
heaps
of
dead
he
had
seen
on
that
island
off
the
bad
axe
river
could
he
live
among
the
people
who
had
done
that
nancy
said
would
you
still
want
to
live
at
victoire
if
redbird
said
she
would
not
come
with
you
he
saw
redbird
small
face
her
slanting
eyes
the
fringe
of
black
hair
that
fell
over
her
forehead
he
felt
her
slender
arms
around
him
as
they
had
held
him
so
many
nights
in
their
wickiup
he
saw
the
love
and
fear
in
eagle
feather
eyes
when
they
parted
so
that
he
could
take
nancy
and
woodrow
to
safety
the
pain
of
being
away
from
them
almost
made
him
want
to
weep
i
do
know
the
answer
to
that
the
trail
i
follow
is
dark
i
must
go
one
step
at
a
time
the
chill
night
air
carried
a
sound
to
his
ears
off
in
the
distance
on
the
bluff
south
of
this
hill
a
man
low
voice
spoke
a
few
words
then
another
voice
answered
he
heard
a
boot
crunch
on
gravel
a
door
slam
the
hair
on
the
back
of
his
neck
lifted
he
raised
his
head
and
his
ears
felt
as
if
they
were
opening
wider
to
take
in
everything
that
came
to
him
the
noises
were
all
faint
no
pale
eyes
would
even
have
noticed
them
what
is
it
said
nancy
the
sounds
seemed
to
come
from
the
town
who
would
be
up
so
long
after
midnight
some
men
talking
a
long
way
off
he
listened
for
the
space
of
a
few
breaths
i
do
hear
anything
now
victor
he
decided
was
making
him
overly
fearful
nancy
said
if
redbird
does
come
to
live
with
you
what
will
become
of
you
and
me
she
took
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
stroking
his
fingers
i
love
you
auguste
now
more
than
ever
before
my
life
depended
on
you
now
i
know
that
i
love
you
of
my
own
free
will
and
i
love
you
nancy
but
you
love
redbird
too
more
than
me
not
more
than
you
in
another
way
sometimes
i
seem
to
be
two
people
among
the
sauk
you
could
have
both
me
and
redbird
as
wives
and
when
i
was
a
captive
and
i
thought
i
might
die
at
any
time
without
ever
having
loved
you
then
i
accepted
your
way
but
if
redbird
lived
here
you
and
i
would
have
to
be
together
in
secret
and
i
could
live
my
whole
life
that
way
he
had
known
it
would
hurt
like
this
this
was
the
very
reason
he
had
tried
again
and
again
to
renounce
nancy
love
i
understand
he
said
and
the
words
seared
his
throat
now
i
would
never
give
up
a
moment
i
spent
with
her
even
to
escape
this
he
ached
to
put
his
arms
around
nancy
and
to
feel
her
holding
him
but
he
made
himself
sit
rigid
fingers
digging
into
his
thighs
nancy
spoke
and
he
could
hear
the
iron
of
grief
in
her
voice
if
redbird
comes
here
as
your
wife
i
leave
here
maybe
we
go
back
east
woodrow
and
i
she
stopped
abruptly
too
choked
by
tears
to
speak
the
fence
rail
they
were
sitting
on
shook
with
her
sobs
something
broke
inside
auguste
and
he
felt
his
eyes
burn
as
the
wetness
trickled
down
his
cheeks
he
slid
from
the
fence
and
held
out
his
arms
to
her
to
see
you
again
and
hear
you
say
you
leave
me
forever
he
said
it
hurts
too
much
she
came
into
his
arms
pressing
her
wet
face
against
his
her
lips
twisted
against
his
burning
devouring
her
arms
slid
around
him
her
hands
stroking
his
neck
he
could
feel
her
pulling
at
him
as
he
held
her
and
her
legs
gave
way
he
knew
they
were
going
to
have
each
other
and
could
not
help
themselves
he
pressed
his
hand
on
her
breast
loving
its
softness
feeling
her
risen
nipple
push
against
his
palm
through
silk
and
calico
footsteps
crackled
in
the
shrubbery
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
froze
all
his
senses
straining
the
hot
blood
in
his
veins
turned
in
an
instant
to
icy
water
auguste
for
god
sake
she
whispered
someone
coming
he
said
he
felt
her
shiver
against
him
he
heard
many
men
they
were
trying
to
move
quietly
filtering
up
the
hill
through
the
woods
but
few
pale
eyes
could
walk
unheard
among
shrubs
and
trees
and
piles
of
fallen
leaves
especially
at
night
along
with
fear
he
felt
a
sudden
anger
at
himself
that
made
him
want
to
pound
his
fist
on
his
head
he
heard
the
voices
before
farther
off
in
the
village
he
should
have
listened
he
have
known
who
and
what
they
were
his
ears
told
him
the
approaching
men
had
formed
a
semicircle
slowly
closing
as
they
climbed
toward
elysée
cottage
his
heart
fluttered
in
his
rib
cage
skipping
beats
then
pounding
hard
nancy
seized
his
hand
god
protect
us
auguste
she
whispered
i
hear
them
too
your
uncle
must
have
found
out
that
you
here
you
got
to
get
away
into
the
house
hurry
in
the
front
room
of
elysée
cottage
frank
and
nicole
were
sitting
by
the
embers
of
the
fire
the
others
had
gone
to
sleep
nancy
flew
into
nicole
arms
we
got
to
get
word
to
the
regulators
said
frank
when
auguste
told
him
about
the
men
coming
up
the
hill
he
shook
woodrow
who
had
been
napping
on
the
chaise
longue
go
by
way
of
the
ravine
on
the
other
side
of
this
hill
frank
told
the
boy
tell
judge
cooper
raoul
and
his
men
are
coming
to
kill
auguste
he
turned
worried
eyes
on
auguste
perhaps
you

his
heart
pounded
so
hard
that
his
voice
shook

at

woodrow

out

carefully
woodrow
nancy
called
after
him

frank
he
went
to
the
mantel
and
reached
for
elysée
pistol
frank
you
ca
nicole
cried
what
choice
do
we
have
he
said
he
took
one
of
the
powder
horns
down
and
sat
to
load
and
prime
the
pistol
auguste
said
frank
there
are
too
many
of
them
if
you
try
to
fight
them
you
only
fire
that
pistol
once
and
then
you
be
dead
frank
said
in
a
few
minutes
cooper
and
the
regulators
will
be
here
all
we
have
to
do
is
hold
raoul
and
his
men
off
a
bit
please
auguste
said
let
me
go
out
and
meet
raoul
alone
elysée
said
absolutely
not
he
stood
in
his
long
nightshirt
in
the
doorway
of
his
bedroom
he
gestured
to
guichard
who
had
followed
him
out
load
my
rifle
guichard
grandpapa
no
auguste
cried
he
wanted
to
throw
his
arms
around
the
old
man
and
protect
him
elysée
shrugged
perhaps
as
frank
says
we
can
face
them
down
without
shooting
you
stay
out
of
sight
auguste
they
can
not
know
for
certain
that
you
are
here
i
will
not
let
this
happen
auguste
said
i
leave
now
i
follow
woodrow
he
strode
to
the
door
could
be
out
they
are
then
i
can
face
raoul
as
i
first
he
yanked
the
door
open
and
saw
raoul
grinning
at
him
his
face
yellow
in
the
candlelight
from
the
cottage
and
beyond
raoul
filling
the
clearing
a
crowd
of
men
with
rifles
raoul
could
see
the
mongrel
face
the
light
spilling
out
of
elysée
house
left
auguste
in
shadow
but
he
did
see
the
split
right
ear
partly
hidden
by
auguste
long
black
hair
he
hefted
the
pistol
held
loosely
in
his
right
hand
this
time
there
would
be
no
missing
point
the
pistol
and
pull
the
trigger
he
is
even
but
behind
auguste
raoul
saw
frank
hopkins
with
a
pistol
and
papa
with
a
rifle
if
he
shot
auguste
he
have
no
time
to
reload
they
have
the
drop
on
him
and
even
if
they
did
shoot
back
they
be
witnesses
against
him
looking
past
frank
he
saw
nicole
and
nancy
hale
glaring
at
him
at
the
sight
of
nancy
his
jaw
muscles
clenched
and
his
hand
tightened
on
the
pistol
grip
could
she
turn
away
from
me
and
take
up
again
with
that
redskin
bastard
come
on
out
mongrel
he
said
to
auguste
maybe
a
jury
found
you
not
guilty
but
we
know
you
guilty
as
hell
you
sent
that
sauk
war
party
here
he
raised
his
voice
and
you
papa
frank
you
fools
to
defend
him
his
indians
were
trying
to
kill
you
too
auguste
said
raoul
you
were
the
cause
of
the
sauk
coming
to
victor
you
are
a
liar
and
a
fool
and
a
coward
and
a
thief
and
a
murderer
auguste
stepped
forward
and
slapped
raoul
face
the
blow
came
too
suddenly
for
raoul
to
react
it
was
even
hard
enough
to
hurt
much
it
was
purely
a
gesture
of
contempt
then
raoul
rage
came
it
flared
up
like
a
forest
fire
he
brought
up
the
pistol
auguste
unprotected
chest
was
less
than
a
foot
away
but
auguste
spoke
again
before
raoul
could
fire
will
you
shoot
an
unarmed
man
now
raoul
go
ahead
prove
yourself
a
coward
when
you
took
victoire
away
from
me
you
would
fight
me
at
old
man
creek
de
marion
run
i
stood
before
you
with
my
hands
empty
and
then
you
tried
to
shoot
me
you
do
have
the
sand
in
you
to
face
me
fairly
raoul
sensed
that
auguste
words
were
aimed
not
at
him
but
at
the
men
behind
him
he
felt
angry
trapped
dammit
shut
him
it
too
late
all
these
men
heard
what
he
you
afraid
to
fight
me
man
to
man
i
challenged
you
the
day
you
drove
me
away
from
victoire
and
you
backed
down
i
challenge
you
again
raoul
an
answer
sprang
into
raoul
mind
i
accept
let
the
weapons
be
your
neck
and
a
rope
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
had
a
sinking
uneasy
feeling
he
did
not
hear
any
of
his
men
laughing
armand
said
what
the
hell
raoul
you
killed
hundreds
of
indians
some
of
them
a
lot
bigger
than
this
one
give
him
his
duel
for
a
moment
raoul
felt
like
turning
his
pistol
on
armand
the
overseer
was
paying
him
back
he
realized
for
the
contempt
he
endured
i
ready
to
meet
you
now
or
any
time
mongrel
let
it
be
tonight
but
where
there
will
be
no
witnesses
to
charge
the
winner
with
murder
auguste
said
i
would
be
a
fool
to
trust
you
and
your
men
you
have
to
said
raoul
i
not
giving
you
any
choice
the
men
will
see
to
it
that
it
a
fair
fight
that
what
they
want
he
keep
the
bitterness
out
of
his
voice
come
with
us
or
i
shoot
you
down
on
this
doorstep
frank
hopkins
pistol
pointing
at
raoul
crowded
into
the
doorway
beside
auguste
the
black
o
of
the
muzzle
pointed
at
him
chilled
raoul
he
heard
that
frank
had
fired
on
the
indians
attacking
the
trading
post
seemed
that
day
had
changed
him
now
he
was
a
man
like
any
other
taking
up
the
gun
like
any
other
frank
said
auguste
is
not
going
with
you
there
will
be
no
duel
get
away
from
this
house
now
seeing
frank
foolish
defiance
in
the
face
of
over
twenty
armed
men
raoul
almost
laughed
but
that
pistol
in
frank
hand
could
end
his
life
he
could
shoot
auguste
while
frank
held
it
on
him
raoul
swung
the
barrel
of
his
own
pistol
to
cover
frank
chest
get
back
inside
frank
he
said
putting
a
steel
edge
into
it
instead
with
a
sudden
movement
that
almost
made
raoul
squeeze
the
trigger
frank
came
forward
stepping
in
front
of
auguste
raoul
saw
another
movement
in
the
doorway
and
then
he
was
staring
into
his
father
glittering
eyes
elysée
rifle
long
barrel
trembling
only
slightly
was
leveled
at
him
raoul
decided
the
best
attack
was
to
laugh
at
them
look
at
the
mongrel
protectors
a
weakling
who
would
never
carry
a
pistol
and
a
lame
old
man
in
his
nightshirt
he
heard
a
few
snickers
among
the
men
behind
him
and
felt
encouraged
but
he
thought
with
fury
he
was
still
trapped
his
pistol
was
aimed
at
frank
but
frank
pistol
and
his
father
rifle
were
both
pointed
at
him
if
he
shot
frank
would
elysée
shoot
him
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
pushed
back
the
hammer
of
his
pistol
the
muzzle
still
aimed
square
at
frank
chest
papa
frank
both
of
you
get
out
of
the
way
or
frank
is
a
dead
man
but
raoul
felt
as
if
the
bottom
was
dropping
out
of
his
stomach
as
he
looked
at
the
two
men
neither
elysée
nor
frank
replied
raoul
saw
resolution
in
frank
light
blue
eyes
the
man
who
had
never
wanted
to
kill
was
prepared
to
die
have
to
shoot
he
heard
nicole
scream
as
his
finger
tightened
on
the
trigger
frank
and
elysée
were
pushed
apart
raoul
was
looking
into
eyes
blazing
with
a
dark
fire
the
mongrel
now
and
you
done
with
him
he
squeezed
the
trigger
hard
the
hammer
fell
and
the
pistol
boomed
and
blossomed
red
fire
and
white
smoke
the
pistol
and
the
rifle
pointed
at
raoul
both
went
off
hurling
a
blinding
bitter
cloud
back
into
his
face
he
stood
unhurt
elysée
and
frank
had
fired
but
by
pushing
unexpectedly
between
them
auguste
had
spoiled
their
aim
the
smoke
cleared
raoul
saw
a
black
spot
on
the
left
side
of
white
shirt
in
an
instant
it
was
a
spreading
scarlet
stain
auguste
eyes
were
shut
he
fell
back
against
nicole
his
knees
buckled
and
he
sagged
to
the
ground
nicole
her
skirts
billowing
threw
her
arms
around
auguste
and
eased
him
down
raoul
felt
a
surge
of
triumph
last
i
killed
the
sonofabitch
but
below
the
triumph
like
chill
black
water
under
thin
ice
lay
fear
of
what
might
happen
now
his
knees
trembled
raoul
saw
nancy
hale
staring
at
him
her
eyes
full
of
hate
if
i
could
have
you
he
wo
it
was
you
led
me
to
him
nancy
he
said
grinning
as
he
saw
her
mouth
twist
in
anguish
when
you
came
here
we
knew
he
was
here
i
pray
that
you
burn
in
hell
for
all
eternity
raoul
de
marion
pretty
talk
for
a
minister
daughter
he
laughed
mon
colonel
armand
called
we
hear
men
running
this
way
must
be
regulators
let
us
ambush
them
we
have
time
to
find
hiding
places
no
said
raoul
we
have
to
silence
this
bunch
he
gestured
at
frank
elysée
guichard
and
nicole
who
were
lifting
auguste
body
into
the
house
i
truly
have
to
stand
trial
for
murder
me
i
never
have
he
stared
into
the
empty
doorway
had
he
really
finished
auguste
better
go
in
there
and
see
but
there
were
three
armed
men
in
there
and
if
he
had
killed
auguste
nothing
could
stop
them
from
trying
to
kill
him
in
fact
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
get
away
from
here
with
his
family
all
fired
up
and
the
regulators
on
the
way
a
very
good
idea
he
heard
nancy
scream
again
and
again
nicole
suddenly
appeared
in
the
doorway
you
are
not
my
brother
anymore
raoul
i
bear
witness
against
you
and
so
will
papa
and
frank
she
broke
down
and
sobbed
then
caught
herself
you
hang
for
this
murder
and
then
just
like
nancy
says
you
burn
in
hell
says
it
is
murder
then
the
mongrel
must
be
dead
for
raoul
felt
a
vast
relief
at
last
he
had
lifted
from
his
shoulders
the
burden
that
had
crushed
them
ever
since
pierre
brought
the
savage
boy
out
of
the
forest
but
the
relief
lasted
only
for
a
moment
the
fear
came
back
his
legs
were
still
shaking
he
wanted
to
run
for
it
at
once
to
get
a
horse
and
ride
out
of
smith
county
and
keep
going
it
was
just
that
he
had
killed
a
man
this
killing
was
not
like
other
killings
this
was
not
some
nameless
indian
or
some
river
rat
knifed
in
a
taproom
brawl
this
was
his
brother
son
the
people
in
this
house
had
loved
auguste
he
remembered
and
it
was
like
something
breathing
cold
on
his
neck
the
fear
he
felt
looking
into
auguste
eyes
at
fort
crawford
medicine
man
was
there
some
way
auguste
could
hurt
him
could
auguste
even
in
death
get
at
him
raoul
shook
himself
shook
off
the
haunting
frightening
thoughts
like
a
dog
shaking
off
water
he
had
never
meant
to
shoot
auguste
in
front
of
witnesses
now
the
regulators
were
coming
and
they
find
the
body
in
the
house
and
him
with
the
smoke
practically
still
twisting
up
from
his
pistol
barrel
and
he
was
ready
to
fight
them
the
trial
would
last
even
as
long
as
auguste
had
he
had
to
go
to
ground
somewhere
until
he
could
collect
more
men
lead
even
if
they
came
there
looking
for
him
he
knew
the
mine
so
much
better
than
anyone
in
smith
county
that
they
never
find
him
only
two
or
three
men
who
had
worked
the
mine
before
the
indian
war
still
lived
in
victor
and
they
would
not
help
the
regulators
in
fact
he
was
sure
he
was
the
only
one
who
knew
about
some
parts
of
the
mine
speak
to
us
mon
colonel
armand
demanded
do
we
fight
no
said
raoul
they
outnumber
us
he
pulled
armand
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
around
elysée
little
house
i
going
to
make
a
run
i
can
be
out
of
the
county
by
daybreak
come
back
in
a
couple
of
weeks
maybe
a
month
by
that
time
things
will
quiet
down
and
i
bring
with
me
the
men
we
need
to
run
these
regulators
out
let
them
think
he
was
going
to
ride
straight
out
of
the
county
let
the
regulators
chase
him
along
the
checagou
road
and
the
galena
road
and
the
fort
armstrong
road
meanwhile
he
hide
out
in
the
mine
till
they
quit
looking
for
him
then
he
leave
the
county
but
it
would
be
best
if
no
one
at
all
knew
exactly
what
he
had
planned
what
will
do
mon
colonel
there
was
accusation
in
armand
eyes
he
probably
felt
raoul
was
deserting
them
what
the
hell
did
armand
expect
him
to
do
he
was
doing
the
best
he
could
for
them
if
he
led
them
into
a
fight
he
only
get
them
killed
like
he
gotten
men
killed
at
de
marion
run
and
at
the
bad
axe
for
now
scatter
deny
you
had
any
part
in
this
wait
for
me
to
come
back
it
will
not
go
easy
for
us
mon
colonel
armand
growled
i
be
back
raoul
said
and
when
i
am
it
will
be
just
like
old
times
in
victor
he
plunged
into
the
trees
behind
elysée
house
while
the
regulators
charged
up
the
hill
he
have
no
trouble
finding
his
way
back
to
the
trading
post
by
moonlight
alone
moving
quickly
through
woods
he
known
since
boyhood
he
felt
suddenly
lighthearted
he
might
be
on
the
run
but
he
done
the
most
important
thing
he
killed
auguste
he
had
a
winter
to
get
through
maybe
a
hard
winter
but
by
next
spring
things
would
be
back
the
way
they
were
in
the
days
when
he
been
happiest
before
he
ever
heard
that
pierre
had
a
son
when
he
ruled
like
a
king
in
smith
county
the
other
world
to
nancy
young
surrey
looked
like
a
brainless
clothier
mannequin
in
his
black
frock
coat
and
ruffled
white
shirt
though
woodrow
had
routed
him
out
of
bed
at
nearly
three
in
the
morning
and
he
had
spent
over
an
hour
working
on
auguste
he
did
seem
tired
if
he
tired
what
in
god
name
had
he
been
doing
now
he
was
leaving
and
auguste
was
still
unconscious
a
helplessness
in
surrey
face
round
and
blank
as
an
unbaked
pie
crust
turned
nancy
grief
and
fear
into
fury
she
wanted
to
grab
his
shoulders
and
shake
him
until
he
promised
that
he
could
and
would
save
auguste
the
bullet
pierced
his
left
lung
surrey
said
but
it
was
a
luckily
so
i
did
have
to
dig
in
there
and
pull
it
out
many
a
doctor
has
killed
a
man
that
way
nancy
took
a
step
toward
the
doctor
he
was
her
only
hope
and
she
would
not
let
him
escape
aside
from
not
killing
him
doctor
what
have
you
done
for
him
i
packed
the
wound
with
cotton
front
and
back
to
stop
the
bleeding
i
put
dressings
on
i
told
hopkins
how
to
change
the
cotton
and
dressings
and
now
he
is
in
the
hands
of
the
almighty
auguste
would
i
hope
the
almighty
guided
hand
doctor
knowing
your
father
was
a
man
of
the
lord
i
sure
your
prayers
for
auguste
will
be
heard
he
got
to
stay
where
he
is
in
his
grandfather
bed
and
fight
for
his
life
i
expect
he
take
a
fever
maybe
pneumonia
the
punctured
lung
is
of
no
use
to
him
he
draw
breath
with
the
other
one
he
be
delirious
and
you
got
to
get
some
food
into
him
soup
the
best
because
he
probably
be
able
to
swallow
that
his
body
will
fight
while
his
mind
sleeps
i
be
back
to
see
him
every
day
through
tight
lips
she
said
tell
me
the
truth
doctor
do
you
think
he
get
better
one
man
in
four
survives
such
a
wound
miss
hale
nancy
shoulders
slumped
this
man
could
do
nothing
more
good
night
then
dr
surrey
back
in
the
bedroom
nancy
could
hear
the
crackling
that
was
breathing
as
blood
bubbled
in
his
pierced
lung
his
face
in
the
candlelight
he
lay
under
the
canopy
of
elysée
covered
to
his
chest
by
a
quilt
his
arms
lay
stretched
out
on
either
side
his
fingers
slightly
curled
breathing
is
so
noisy
at
least
we
know
when
he
nancy
felt
as
if
she
herself
were
being
swept
away
on
a
black
tide
of
sorrow
elysée
sitting
by
the
bed
staring
into
his
grandson
face
looked
almost
as
near
death
as
auguste
guichard
stood
behind
him
a
clawlike
hand
perched
on
his
master
shoulder
nicole
her
eyes
round
and
dark
with
suffering
asked
what
can
we
do
for
him
nancy
said
the
doctor
says
it
up
to
auguste
and
god
elysée
grunted
where
was
god
when
this
happened
if
auguste
were
conscious
nancy
thought
he
would
be
asking
earthmaker
for
help
in
the
camps
of
the
british
band
nancy
had
never
seen
auguste
give
up
on
a
sick
or
wounded
person
he
had
applied
his
remedies
gone
into
his
trance
danced
and
chanted
to
summon
the
aid
of
his
spirit
helpers
wrestled
with
the
hurt
till
either
the
man
soul
left
his
body
or
the
healing
was
well
begun
at
first
his
practices
had
seemed
foolish
and
savage
to
her
but
auguste
had
done
his
work
with
such
devotion
that
she
came
watching
him
to
love
him
all
the
more
and
out
of
love
to
respect
what
he
did
he
not
the
only
one
who
practices
that
maybe
that
was
what
he
needed
now
one
of
his
own
people
to
call
on
the
spirits
for
him
if
only
auguste
were
awake
he
could
tell
her
what
to
do
redbird
had
helped
auguste
with
his
work
she
remembered
the
last
time
she
had
seen
redbird
small
emaciated
holding
the
broken
body
of
floating
lily
in
her
arms
redbird
was
probably
more
in
need
of
help
than
able
to
give
it
and
yet
nancy
had
seen
that
she
had
a
marvelous
knowledge
of
healing
besides
she
had
told
nancy
that
she
wanted
to
be
a
shaman
herself
like
white
bear
and
owl
carver
it
would
be
better
to
go
to
redbird
than
sit
here
and
watch
auguste
die
i
going
to
his
people
nancy
said
to
find
someone
i
think
can
help
him
no
sauk
will
be
willing
to
come
here
said
frank
not
after
what
these
people
did
to
them
this
one
will
said
nancy
a
heavy
cold
rain
drummed
on
the
leather
top
of
nancy
buggy
driven
by
a
sergeant
the
little
carriage
splashed
into
the
sauk
camp
that
huddled
beside
the
wooden
walls
of
fort
armstrong
a
dozen
peaked
army
tents
their
canvas
sagging
under
the
rain
in
a
muddy
field
were
all
nancy
could
see
there
were
no
people
in
sight
i
know
how
you
going
to
find
anybody
here
said
the
sergeant
nancy
judged
him
to
be
a
few
years
older
than
she
was
his
name
was
benson
he
had
cheeks
and
a
blond
mustache
so
thick
that
it
completely
hid
his
mouth
dark
faces
started
to
appear
at
the
tent
flaps
she
wanted
to
weep
as
she
saw
the
misery
of
the
women
and
children
who
slowly
came
out
some
of
them
holding
blankets
over
their
heads
to
stand
in
the
mud
and
stare
at
her
i
be
glad
to
see
the
sauk
brought
so
low
did
she
owe
it
to
her
father
nancy
asked
herself
to
rejoice
in
the
fate
of
the
people
who
had
murdered
him
and
what
about
the
horrid
things
they
done
to
her
so
proud
they
been
the
faces
the
feathers
in
their
hair
the
day
wolf
paw
led
them
to
burn
and
kill
at
victor
now
they
huddled
what
was
left
of
them
in
the
rain
in
a
muddy
field
in
tattered
army
tents
but
she
felt
no
pleasure
seeing
the
sauk
in
final
defeat
through
auguste
they
had
become
her
people
she
felt
suddenly
uncomfortable
sitting
in
the
shelter
of
the
top
staring
down
at
the
sodden
figures
in
the
rain
if
they
could
stand
in
the
rain
she
decided
she
could
too
she
jumped
down
the
sergeant
called
sounding
alarmed
but
he
made
no
move
to
follow
in
an
instant
her
bonnet
her
shawl
her
dress
were
all
sopping
but
she
did
care
because
the
people
she
was
looking
at
were
soaked
too
she
looked
for
familiar
faces
the
people
standing
before
her
seemed
made
of
mud
from
head
to
foot
they
were
a
dull
brown
color
it
is
yellow
hair
she
understood
the
sauk
words
and
looked
around
to
see
who
had
spoken
but
all
she
saw
were
black
eyes
wide
with
sudden
fear
of
course
they
all
remembered
her
as
the
pale
eyes
woman
who
had
been
kidnapped
and
nearly
killed
and
who
had
escaped
they
must
think
she
had
come
to
accuse
and
punish
yes
now
that
they
knew
her
they
were
backing
away
ducking
into
their
tents
no
wait
nancy
cried
she
wanted
to
tell
them
not
to
be
afraid
but
did
know
how
redbird
was
the
only
one
she
could
talk
to
and
was
not
a
word
redbird
had
taught
her
a
man
was
standing
in
front
of
her
his
eyes
were
empty
his
face
thin
and
dirty
he
seemed
familiar
he
held
out
his
hands
he
seemed
to
be
saying
here
i
am
take
me
all
at
once
nancy
recognized
wolf
paw
his
hair
had
grown
out
hanging
down
in
short
black
strands
all
around
his
head
but
at
last
she
recognized
that
noble
face
that
much
though
she
hated
him
at
first
had
always
reminded
her
of
the
engravings
she
seen
of
roman
statues
she
understood
what
he
was
trying
to
tell
her
if
she
come
to
find
the
murderer
of
her
father
the
man
who
had
kidnapped
her
here
he
was
he
was
at
her
mercy
he
seemed
to
have
lost
everything
else
she
thought
but
not
his
courage
is
that
injun
threatening
you
called
the
sergeant
from
the
shelter
of
the
buggy
not
at
all
she
said
and
smiled
at
wolf
paw
she
felt
heartsick
to
see
how
the
splendid
warrior
had
declined
into
a
shabby
spectre
she
tried
to
tell
wolf
paw
in
the
mixture
of
sauk
english
and
gesture
that
she
had
used
with
redbird
that
she
had
not
come
here
to
avenge
herself
on
him
that
all
she
wanted
was
to
find
redbird
but
then
redbird
was
standing
before
her
like
wolf
paw
she
had
changed
so
much
that
for
a
moment
nancy
sure
this
redbird
she
was
as
thin
as
a
fence
rail
and
those
colorful
things
nancy
remembered
her
wearing
the
feathers
and
beads
the
dyed
quills
the
painted
figures
on
her
dress
all
were
gone
she
clutched
a
coarse
brown
blanket
around
her
shoulders
her
head
was
bare
water
dripped
from
the
fringe
of
hair
across
her
forehead
and
poured
from
her
braids
she
wore
not
the
doeskin
clothing
nancy
remembered
but
a
torn
gray
cotton
dress
that
was
too
big
for
her
and
dirty
around
the
bottom
edge
looking
down
nancy
saw
that
redbird
feet
were
bare
her
toes
sinking
into
the
mud
nancy
felt
warm
tears
mingling
with
the
cold
rain
on
her
face
as
she
saw
redbird
smiling
at
her
redbird
i
am
glad
to
see
my
sister
nancy
said
in
their
special
language
where
is
your
wickiup
redbird
spoke
to
wolf
paw
in
sauk
words
too
low
and
rapid
for
nancy
to
follow
he
grunted
assent
and
trudged
through
the
mud
toward
a
distant
tent
watching
him
nancy
felt
pity
at
his
rounded
shoulders
and
old
man
shuffle
redbird
beckoned
nancy
to
follow
her
to
the
tent
she
come
from
where
you
going
the
sergeant
called
i
be
all
right
nancy
called
over
her
shoulder
raising
her
voice
over
the
drumming
of
the
rain
this
is
the
woman
i
came
to
find
she
could
see
the
young
soldier
shaking
his
head
why
would
a
young
white
woman
go
into
the
filthy
tents
of
these
indians
the
lord
open
his
eyes
and
at
first
the
inside
of
the
tent
seemed
black
as
a
moonless
night
to
nancy
and
the
smell
of
damp
unwashed
bodies
made
her
stomach
churn
she
took
redbird
hand
and
held
it
for
reassurance
not
too
tightly
the
bones
felt
delicate
redbird
explained
that
they
had
no
dry
wood
for
a
fire
the
long
knives
had
promised
to
bring
them
some
but
they
had
yet
the
air
was
as
chill
in
the
tent
as
it
was
outside
and
nancy
heard
women
and
children
coughing
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
time
sauk
fashion
nancy
eyes
adjusted
to
the
dim
light
filtering
through
the
canvas
till
she
could
see
face
she
saw
eagle
feather
looking
at
her
out
of
the
shadows
with
huge
blue
eyes
a
little
skeleton
whose
covering
of
skin
looked
like
stretched
brown
leather
hurting
inside
she
greeted
him
with
a
pat
on
the
arm
if
only
she
could
do
for
him
what
she
had
done
for
woodrow
now
she
could
see
four
other
women
and
two
little
girls
huddled
together
near
the
rear
nancy
broke
the
silence
redbird
white
bear
needs
you
wincing
in
pain
redbird
narrowed
her
slanting
eyes
she
asked
what
had
happened
to
white
bear
redbird
nancy
learned
had
heard
no
news
of
auguste
since
the
day
he
left
black
hawk
camp
to
take
woodrow
and
nancy
back
to
the
whites
auguste
had
told
nancy
that
he
had
tried
to
get
word
to
redbird
now
she
silently
damned
the
soldiers
for
not
bothering
to
pass
the
messages
on
no
doubt
they
thought
it
not
worth
the
trouble
when
nancy
told
redbird
that
she
had
left
white
bear
four
days
ago
unconscious
with
a
bullet
wound
in
his
chest
she
saw
the
gleam
of
tears
on
redbird
cheeks
the
pale
eyes
doctor
says
he
can
do
no
more
nancy
finished
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
help
him
now
you
know
the
sauk
way
of
healing
you
told
me
you
wanted
to
be
a
shaman
no
redbird
said
quietly
she
a
shaman
the
declaration
startled
nancy
you
told
me
the
men
would
let
you
be
one
in
their
private
language
redbird
said
that
for
a
long
time
she
had
not
understood
what
it
meant
to
be
a
shaman
she
had
thought
that
a
shaman
must
be
made
by
another
shaman
but
now
she
knew
that
if
people
came
to
a
person
for
help
that
person
was
a
shaman
and
people
were
coming
to
her
i
have
come
to
you
nancy
said
you
can
help
white
bear
redbird
gave
a
helpless
grunt
that
said
she
could
not
the
soldiers
would
not
let
her
leave
nancy
reached
into
her
handbag
and
drew
out
a
folded
paper
i
have
spoken
with
general
winfield
scott
this
says
that
you
may
come
with
me
redbird
sat
in
the
damp
straw
looking
down
at
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
nancy
waited
anxiously
for
her
to
speak
after
a
moment
her
voice
full
of
pain
and
uncertainty
redbird
asked
did
white
bear
to
see
her
the
question
shocked
nancy
it
had
not
occurred
to
nancy
that
redbird
might
ever
doubt
auguste
love
for
her
recovering
from
her
surprise
nancy
said
before
his
uncle
shot
him
white
bear
told
me
he
was
going
to
come
here
to
find
you
and
eagle
feather
you
are
first
in
his
heart
redbird
my
god
how
i
wish
it
could
be
me
redbird
looked
sadly
at
nancy
she
was
not
first
in
white
bear
heart
she
said
that
land
that
had
been
stolen
from
him
was
shocked
nancy
started
to
blurt
out
a
denial
but
she
realized
she
could
not
auguste
had
gone
to
victor
before
he
went
anywhere
else
he
is
dying
do
you
want
to
save
his
life
nancy
asked
oh
yes
redbird
did
if
earthmaker
would
help
her
in
the
shadows
of
the
tent
nancy
could
see
the
glint
of
tears
on
redbird
cheek
then
you
will
come
with
me
redbird
lowered
her
face
must
she
go
back
to
the
place
where
they
killed
her
baby
at
the
memory
nancy
broke
into
sobs
and
threw
her
arms
around
redbird
as
she
had
done
that
terrible
day
i
will
always
remember
floating
lily
nancy
said
i
fought
to
save
her
i
thought
she
was
my
baby
too
they
held
each
other
in
silence
for
a
while
and
then
the
thought
came
to
nancy
that
even
a
small
delay
might
make
the
difference
between
auguste
living
and
dying
nancy
felt
a
chill
that
ran
deeper
than
the
cold
damp
air
in
the
tent
redbird
he
will
die
if
you
do
not
come
you
have
to
come
redbird
sighed
it
was
true
she
would
go
with
yellow
hair
nancy
heavy
heart
felt
a
little
lighter
if
there
was
any
hope
at
all
for
auguste
it
lay
with
redbird
one
thing
they
must
take
with
them
redbird
told
her
when
they
were
marching
to
this
place
a
soldier
had
taken
white
knife
from
redbird
it
was
the
same
soldier
who
had
come
with
yellow
hair
today
the
one
with
the
red
face
and
the
yellow
mustache
it
would
be
well
if
yellow
hair
could
get
it
from
him
so
they
could
bring
it
back
to
white
bear
it
would
give
him
strength
i
brought
money
with
me
nancy
said
i
will
buy
it
back
from
him
if
i
have
to
get
it
back
from
him
if
i
have
to
kill
redbird
eyes
blurred
as
she
stared
at
white
bear
face
as
pale
as
the
moon
she
wanted
to
scream
to
throw
herself
weeping
on
his
form
her
longing
to
see
him
open
his
eyes
to
hear
his
voice
was
so
strong
it
hurt
her
she
remembered
the
night
of
his
vision
quest
when
she
was
sure
he
would
freeze
to
death
she
thought
of
the
summers
they
had
been
apart
the
nights
they
had
lain
together
she
thought
of
poor
dead
floating
lily
and
of
eagle
feather
left
in
wolf
keeping
come
back
to
me
white
bear
she
had
never
tried
to
heal
anyone
this
close
to
death
when
she
and
yellow
hair
arrived
the
grandfather
said
that
white
bear
had
sometimes
opened
his
eyes
and
spoken
but
each
day
he
had
been
awake
a
shorter
time
redbird
saw
that
white
bear
was
already
wandering
in
the
other
world
a
thread
no
stronger
than
a
strand
of
spider
silk
linked
his
spirit
with
his
body
she
let
the
love
she
felt
for
white
bear
flow
through
her
giving
her
strength
she
felt
the
eyes
of
yellow
hair
the
grandfather
and
the
old
servant
upon
her
but
she
ignored
them
she
squatted
down
on
the
floor
beside
white
bear
bed
and
unrolled
the
blanket
in
which
she
carried
her
medicines
and
supplies
and
the
possessions
white
bear
had
left
with
her
at
the
bad
axe
her
eye
fell
on
the
bundle
of
talking
papers
white
bear
had
cherished
so
that
he
said
was
called
something
like
the
lost
land
of
happiness
there
was
power
in
that
bundle
of
words
gently
she
laid
it
on
his
left
side
near
the
wound
on
his
right
she
placed
the
knife
that
yellow
hair
had
been
able
to
retrieve
for
her
arranging
the
three
medicine
bags
on
the
floor
she
took
pieces
of
elm
bark
from
the
largest
one
and
gave
them
to
yellow
hair
make
a
tea
for
him
from
this
it
will
give
him
strength
when
he
awakens
she
forced
herself
to
turn
her
back
on
white
bear
and
go
out
of
the
house
with
her
she
carried
the
blanket
and
the
medicine
bag
adorned
with
the
beadwork
owl
she
crossed
the
little
clearing
around
the
house
and
entered
the
woods
here
where
no
one
could
see
her
she
opened
the
medicine
bag
and
took
out
five
tiny
gray
scraps
of
the
magic
mushroom
she
put
them
into
her
mouth
and
chewed
and
swallowed
slowly
then
she
got
down
on
her
hands
and
knees
and
spread
her
blanket
oak
maple
and
elm
leaves
brown
red
and
yellow
lay
thick
on
the
ground
she
scooped
leaves
into
the
blanket
when
she
had
gathered
a
big
pile
she
bundled
them
up
and
went
back
into
the
house
carefully
she
spread
the
leaves
on
the
bed
over
white
bear
body
she
heard
the
grandfather
say
something
to
yellow
hair
yellow
hair
spoke
quietly
to
her
saying
that
the
grandfather
feared
that
the
leaves
were
not
clean
and
would
make
white
bear
sicker
how
could
the
leaves
not
be
clean
redbird
wondered
when
they
came
from
the
woods
outside
any
dwelling
but
she
answered
must
do
what
i
know
if
seem
wrong
to
him
must
do
anyway
or
can
do
nothing
she
heard
yellow
hair
talking
quietly
to
the
grandfather
while
she
settled
herself
on
the
floor
beside
the
east
side
of
the
bed
she
could
not
understand
the
words
but
she
heard
acceptance
in
the
old
sigh
grief
and
fear
that
white
bear
would
die
trembled
inside
her
breathing
deeply
she
let
the
strength
of
those
feelings
enter
into
her
spirit
urging
her
on
to
begin
the
journey
she
must
make
she
must
go
into
the
other
world
and
find
her
guide
she
began
the
medicine
woman
chant
sun
woman
had
taught
her
let
me
walk
through
the
dark
place
to
the
light
of
the
other
world
oh
my
red
spirit
bird
fly
to
me
sing
to
me
from
the
other
world
let
me
walk
the
sunwise
circle
into
the
night
that
hides
this
man
oh
my
red
spirit
bird
sing
to
me
and
fly
with
me
to
the
other
world
sing
and
fly
sing
and
fly
in
the
sunwise
circle
to
the
other
world
into
the
night
she
allowed
the
chant
to
settle
into
a
simple
repetitious
humming
that
slowly
with
the
help
of
the
magic
mushroom
drew
her
soul
out
of
her
body
she
stood
up
the
three
people
gathered
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
did
not
see
her
standing
they
were
looking
at
her
seated
body
she
looked
down
at
white
bear
she
saw
through
the
leaves
she
had
spread
over
him
and
right
through
his
skin
five
glowing
streaks
ran
from
his
collarbone
to
his
belly
the
claw
marks
of
his
guardian
she
saw
the
hole
in
his
chest
how
it
ran
between
his
ribs
in
the
eight
days
he
had
been
lying
here
the
wound
had
closed
up
if
he
lived
long
enough
it
would
heal
slowly
but
there
was
water
pooling
in
his
chest
and
the
longer
he
lay
there
unconscious
the
more
the
water
would
fill
up
his
chest
until
he
drowned
his
spirit
must
be
coaxed
back
from
the
other
world
she
began
to
walk
the
sunwise
circle
around
white
bear
bed
from
the
east
to
the
south
white
bear
on
her
right
she
passed
yellow
hair
white
bear
grandfather
and
the
old
servant
they
stood
like
carved
statues
unseeing
she
walked
around
the
west
side
of
the
bed
the
head
of
the
bed
was
against
the
north
wall
of
the
room
but
she
simply
walked
through
the
wall
on
one
side
of
the
bed
took
a
few
steps
along
the
north
side
of
the
cottage
then
entered
the
wall
again
and
continued
her
circle
when
she
had
completed
her
ninth
circuit
of
the
bed
she
saw
a
cave
mouth
in
the
eastern
wall
of
the
bedroom
unhesitatingly
she
walked
into
the
black
circular
opening
she
could
not
see
where
the
light
in
the
cave
was
coming
from
but
its
curving
walls
were
clearly
visible
to
her
here
and
there
she
passed
paintings
she
had
seen
them
when
she
made
her
first
journey
to
the
other
world
after
she
buried
floating
lily
she
saw
the
wolf
the
coyote
the
elk
and
the
buffalo
near
the
floor
of
the
cave
she
passed
paintings
of
the
trout
the
pike
the
salmon
and
other
fish
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
owl
her
father
guardian
spirit
the
passage
slanted
downward
and
grew
narrower
until
her
head
brushed
the
cave
roof
and
her
shoulders
touched
the
walls
then
she
rounded
a
bend
and
bright
blue
light
greeted
her
the
cave
opened
out
high
on
a
hillside
she
was
looking
down
at
tall
yellow
grass
rolling
in
waves
to
distant
hills
a
black
cloud
of
crows
flapped
up
out
of
the
grass
and
flew
over
her
head
laughing
raucously
then
she
heard
a
marvelous
singing
she
recognized
it
at
once
the
song
of
her
guardian
spirit
the
redbird
she
saw
a
flash
and
then
the
bird
perched
on
a
branch
of
blue
spruce
on
the
hillside
he
had
one
bright
eye
cocked
at
her
ringed
in
black
his
red
crest
stood
up
on
his
head
as
wolf
paw
had
in
better
days
white
bear
is
out
there
on
the
prairie
the
redbird
spirit
sang
he
is
hunting
his
uncle
can
i
heal
him
redbird
asked
the
dazzling
bird
chirped
a
yes
he
is
lost
he
is
wandering
with
his
other
self
the
bear
spirit
he
will
not
leave
the
spirit
world
until
the
bear
finds
his
uncle
redbird
shivered
what
will
white
bear
guardian
do
to
his
uncle
she
remembered
both
owl
carver
and
sun
woman
saying
that
a
shaman
power
must
never
be
used
to
harm
any
person
what
must
happen
must
happen
the
bird
sang
if
white
bear
is
to
be
free
to
go
back
to
his
body
redbird
still
felt
uneasy
a
shadow
like
a
sudden
prairie
storm
seemed
to
fall
upon
the
landscape
the
streak
of
scarlet
sailed
out
over
the
endless
grass
and
redbird
ran
down
the
hill
until
the
tassels
were
waving
high
over
her
head
she
could
see
nothing
on
all
sides
of
her
but
yellow
spears
of
straw
overhead
was
a
patch
of
bright
blue
framed
by
tassels
in
the
center
of
the
blue
the
bird
spirit
hovered
wings
a
blur
of
red
she
pushed
her
way
through
the
stalks
as
the
bird
led
her
on
and
on
flew
her
spirit
guide
redbird
did
not
tire
either
as
she
would
have
in
the
ordinary
world
trudging
through
the
grass
she
could
not
see
the
sun
but
the
light
seemed
never
to
change
and
no
matter
how
long
she
walked
the
same
bit
of
cloudless
sky
remained
overhead
then
white
bear
stood
before
her
he
was
wearing
only
a
deerskin
loincloth
and
moccasins
his
long
hair
was
bound
with
a
beaded
band
the
scar
on
his
cheek
stood
out
white
against
his
tan
skin
she
looked
at
his
naked
chest
and
saw
the
five
shining
claw
marks
and
the
small
opening
of
the
bullet
wound
she
looked
deep
into
his
dark
eyes
his
love
flowed
out
to
her
and
she
bathed
in
it
as
in
a
warm
river
she
knew
his
thoughts
how
happy
and
surprised
he
was
to
see
her
was
lost
out
here
you
have
come
for
he
held
out
his
arms
and
she
rushed
into
them
she
felt
his
arms
around
her
even
though
he
was
a
spirit
and
she
was
a
spirit
she
laid
her
head
against
his
scarred
chest
and
listened
to
his
beating
heart
would
she
ever
again
back
in
the
world
of
flesh
hold
him
like
this
a
huge
head
crashed
through
the
wall
of
grass
around
them
and
enormous
golden
eyes
looked
at
her
white
bear
had
described
his
guardian
spirit
to
her
but
she
had
never
realized
the
bear
was
so
big
she
looked
at
black
lips
that
bared
yellow
teeth
longer
than
her
fingers
she
stared
down
at
claws
that
crushed
the
grass
and
sank
into
the
prairie
sod
she
shivered
at
the
thought
of
what
might
happen
to
white
bear
uncle
if
this
spirit
found
him
perched
on
the
head
of
the
bear
was
the
tiny
red
spirit
bird
are
looking
for
my
father
came
white
bear
thought
killed
my
mother
and
many
brothers
and
sisters
of
yours
and
mine
he
shot
the
bird
sang
to
redbird
i
know
where
the
uncle
is
but
i
can
only
lead
the
bear
to
him
if
you
say
i
must
do
it
i
say
you
must
then
she
said
just
above
a
whisper
whatever
was
needed
to
save
white
bear
life
she
had
to
do
it
whatever
she
must
give
up
in
return
the
bird
leaped
into
the
air
his
crest
a
bloody
spearpoint
the
bear
lifted
a
black
nose
the
size
of
redbird
fist
and
the
white
body
turned
to
follow
passing
before
her
like
a
mountain
of
snow
hand
in
hand
white
bear
and
redbird
followed
the
bird
flew
far
ahead
and
they
could
not
see
him
but
the
bear
trampled
down
the
grass
and
left
a
path
that
was
easy
to
follow
loving
thoughts
passed
between
white
bear
and
redbird
if
they
always
met
like
this
redbird
thought
they
could
know
what
was
in
each
heart
and
their
love
would
be
deeper
then
she
remembered
wolf
paw
and
the
new
life
that
she
alone
knew
was
growing
in
her
belly
the
life
that
fulfilled
wolf
paw
wish
to
have
a
child
with
her
she
felt
like
a
statue
carved
in
ice
and
at
that
very
moment
white
bear
let
go
of
her
hand
somehow
she
knew
that
he
was
withdrawing
from
her
not
because
he
had
sensed
her
thought
about
wolf
paw
but
because
he
was
troubled
by
some
thought
of
his
own
but
instantly
there
was
a
space
between
them
and
she
no
longer
knew
his
mind
he
was
still
walking
beside
her
he
walked
straight
ahead
not
looking
at
her
she
turned
her
head
to
the
front
and
did
the
same
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
pushed
away
hard
and
it
hurt
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
walked
for
days
through
the
unchanging
grass
but
the
sun
remained
fixed
somewhere
beyond
the
tasseled
curtain
yellow
and
blue
yellow
and
blue
the
whole
world
had
been
reduced
to
those
colors
and
to
one
sound
whispering
grass
the
bear
stopped
walking
redbird
and
white
bear
went
around
the
huge
animal
redbird
to
the
right
and
white
bear
to
the
left
she
found
herself
on
the
edge
of
a
great
crack
in
the
ground
so
deep
that
its
bottom
lay
in
shadow
it
zigzagged
from
somewhere
appearing
out
of
grass
and
continued
toward
somewhere
vanishing
back
into
the
prairie
a
stream
of
bright
blue
water
wound
through
the
dark
bottom
of
the
ravine
water
had
cut
this
wound
in
the
prairie
the
bird
spirit
swooped
and
darted
in
the
crack
like
a
living
fire
arrow
white
bear
uncle
hides
there
the
bird
trilled
she
heard
a
growl
beside
her
deep
as
distant
thunder
and
the
ground
seemed
to
tremble
the
bird
flew
up
swooped
to
hover
over
the
bear
head
then
dove
down
into
the
canyon
down
to
an
entrance
into
the
earth
framed
by
two
upright
wooden
posts
and
a
beam
laid
across
them
beside
the
square
of
darkness
were
abandoned
wooden
carts
and
a
hill
of
gray
gravel
that
partly
blocked
the
stream
this
was
a
mine
redbird
understood
where
the
pale
eyes
dug
metal
out
of
the
ground
the
bear
spirit
put
one
paw
in
front
of
the
other
and
with
grace
and
balance
astonishing
in
a
creature
so
huge
walked
down
a
narrow
path
redbird
had
not
noticed
before
to
the
shadowy
bottom
of
the
ravine
then
it
lumbered
up
to
the
mine
mouth
she
opened
her
mouth
to
cry
out
in
fear
but
the
bear
was
gone
is
a
man
in
and
her
spirit
helper
the
redbird
had
led
that
giant
bear
to
him
she
had
commanded
it
she
had
not
wanted
to
use
her
shaman
powers
to
hurt
anyone
not
even
one
she
hated
as
much
as
this
uncle
of
white
bear
white
bear
had
saved
many
lives
and
never
killed
anyone
even
though
she
was
a
spirit
and
this
great
grassland
was
sunny
she
felt
cold
and
her
stomach
knotted
will
lose
something
because
i
did
this
i
only
did
it
to
bring
white
bear
back
to
his
body
but
i
will
suffer
for
it
even
so
will
white
let
white
bear
she
prayed
to
the
powers
that
brought
life
into
the
world
white
bear
turned
to
her
is
said
his
spirit
voice
other
self
has
found
raoul
de
you
can
come
with
she
answered
him
to
your
to
my
came
his
whisper
and
she
shuddered
even
as
she
turned
following
the
bird
spirit
as
he
fluttered
over
her
head
when
he
thought
of
his
home
he
meant
the
great
lodge
the
pale
eyes
called
victoire
redbird
opened
her
eyes
in
the
room
where
white
bear
lay
to
find
herself
once
again
sitting
on
the
floor
beside
the
bed
the
three
people
were
looking
at
her
yellow
hair
with
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
the
grandfather
withered
face
paler
than
the
fur
of
white
bear
guardian
spirit
the
old
servant
bloodshot
eyes
wide
she
remembered
that
the
sun
had
been
low
in
the
west
when
she
came
to
this
house
sunlight
still
slanted
through
the
west
window
and
fell
on
the
layer
of
leaves
that
covered
white
bear
bed
but
when
she
tried
to
move
pain
struck
her
like
knives
driven
into
her
knees
and
elbows
as
if
she
had
been
sitting
in
the
same
position
for
days
his
eyes
yellow
hair
cried
pointing
at
white
bear
from
the
floor
redbird
could
not
see
what
yellow
hair
was
seeing
she
forced
her
aching
legs
to
lift
her
white
bear
looked
at
redbird
then
at
yellow
hair
he
smiled
faintly
she
had
done
it
he
was
back
in
his
body
a
spring
of
pure
sweet
joy
burst
up
inside
her
a
sob
welled
from
her
lips
she
stumbled
toward
yellow
hair
and
felt
that
she
was
going
to
fall
yellow
hair
arms
held
her
up
she
saw
his
mouth
open
heard
him
whisper
to
her
you
brought
me
back
i
will
always
love
you
and
i
will
always
love
you
redbird
said
her
voice
was
a
croak
as
if
she
had
not
spoken
in
days
she
turned
to
yellow
hair
now
he
will
live
laughing
and
crying
at
once
yellow
hair
thanked
redbird
again
and
again
in
their
common
language
calling
on
her
god
to
bless
redbird
me
but
what
of
that
man
in
the
mine
give
white
bear
the
tea
of
elm
bark
now
later
little
food
only
little
redbird
said
food
hominy
good
later
soup
with
meat
yellow
hair
eagerly
agreed
must
sleep
said
redbird
she
slurred
her
words
too
worn
out
to
speak
clearly
she
could
lie
down
in
another
room
yellow
hair
said
leading
her
away
from
the
canopied
bed
where
the
weeping
grandfather
bent
over
white
bear
holding
him
by
his
shoulders
i
gone
many
days
redbird
asked
yellow
hair
deep
blue
eyes
widened
she
shook
her
head
at
the
word
days
she
assured
redbird
that
she
had
been
silent
only
for
an
instant
she
had
been
singing
then
she
closed
her
eyes
and
a
moment
later
when
she
opened
them
again
white
bear
had
opened
his
yellow
hair
hugged
her
so
hard
it
hurt
her
an
instant
every
time
redbird
went
on
a
shaman
journey
she
learned
something
new
yellow
hair
her
arm
around
redbird
shoulders
led
her
to
a
bed
in
another
room
redbird
had
never
lain
on
a
pale
eyes
bed
but
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
and
fell
back
if
she
was
not
so
tired
she
would
not
have
been
able
to
sleep
in
this
bed
it
was
too
soft
yellow
hair
lifted
her
legs
onto
the
bed
for
her
that
was
the
last
thing
redbird
remembered
after
a
day
and
a
night
of
sleep
redbird
woke
refreshed
and
hungry
a
cure
for
that
was
quickly
produced
for
her
and
now
she
was
sitting
on
a
pale
eyes
chair
at
a
pale
eyes
table
devouring
slices
of
fried
pig
meat
and
fluffy
cakes
brought
to
her
by
the
old
servant
seated
across
from
her
was
a
fat
smiling
woman
she
had
met
once
before
this
woman
had
tried
to
comfort
her
the
day
floating
lily
was
killed
this
she
knew
was
white
bear
aunt
yellow
hair
tears
streaming
from
her
turquoise
eyes
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
room
where
white
bear
lay
white
bear
she
said
wanted
redbird
to
come
to
him
redbird
hunger
vanished
she
went
rigid
hair
weeps
now
but
i
will
weep
forever
she
heard
the
suffering
in
yellow
hair
voice
and
knew
that
her
heart
was
hurting
because
she
believed
redbird
was
going
to
take
white
bear
away
from
her
redbird
knew
better
she
had
defiled
her
powers
by
using
them
to
destroy
white
bear
uncle
and
now
she
must
pay
for
it
the
lance
twisted
in
her
heart
as
she
stood
up
at
the
table
the
fat
woman
stood
up
when
redbird
did
came
around
the
table
and
hugged
her
she
smelled
of
bread
redbird
walked
past
yellow
hair
to
enter
the
bedroom
white
bear
was
reclining
with
pillows
behind
his
head
in
the
bed
where
he
had
lain
for
so
many
days
his
chest
was
bare
except
for
the
white
bindings
that
protected
his
wound
the
wrappings
made
his
olive
skin
look
darker
and
above
the
cloth
redbird
could
see
the
start
of
the
five
shining
scars
that
ran
down
his
chest
the
leaves
had
been
cleared
away
from
the
quilt
that
covered
him
his
bundle
of
talking
papers
telling
the
story
of
the
first
man
and
woman
and
how
they
lost
their
land
of
happiness
was
on
the
table
beside
his
bed
next
to
it
lay
the
knife
star
arrow
had
given
him
when
he
was
a
small
boy
when
he
saw
her
his
face
glowed
and
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
she
rushed
to
him
and
heard
a
cry
of
pain
behind
her
the
door
of
the
bedroom
shut
softly
she
threw
herself
across
the
bed
longing
to
hold
white
bear
his
arms
around
her
were
not
as
strong
as
she
remembered
them
but
his
embrace
was
firm
you
came
to
me
while
my
spirit
wandered
on
the
prairie
he
said
the
redbird
guided
me
to
you
before
you
came
i
saw
many
things
what
things
he
said
the
pale
eyes
will
spread
across
the
great
river
and
even
into
the
great
desert
there
will
be
no
place
left
for
our
people
if
we
go
far
enough
west
she
began
no
he
said
they
will
go
as
far
as
the
western
ocean
the
turtle
warned
me
about
this
he
stroked
her
hair
lightly
and
she
rested
her
head
on
his
shoulder
she
had
a
feeling
that
she
would
never
lie
like
this
with
him
again
you
are
so
much
better
today
she
said
you
too
know
the
way
of
the
shaman
now
you
healed
me
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
into
his
eyes
this
was
the
moment
when
they
must
decide
i
am
the
only
shaman
our
people
have
now
she
forced
herself
to
say
the
few
who
are
left
need
me
i
must
go
back
to
them
his
eyes
shut
tight
suddenly
as
if
his
wound
was
paining
him
stay
here
with
me
he
said
his
words
struck
her
and
tore
through
her
as
his
uncle
bullet
had
torn
through
him
i
could
never
stay
here
when
you
are
well
enough
will
you
not
come
back
to
your
people
he
shook
his
head
we
can
not
fight
the
pale
eyes
and
we
can
not
run
from
them
they
will
destroy
us
unless
we
learn
to
live
as
the
pale
eyes
do
that
destroys
us
too
that
saves
us
his
nostrils
flared
and
his
dark
eyes
glowed
i
can
use
the
power
this
wealth
and
this
land
gives
me
to
fight
for
our
people
and
you
can
do
it
with
me
and
eagle
feather
i
will
show
the
people
how
to
make
use
of
pale
eyes
ways
i
will
share
my
land
with
them
her
heart
felt
as
if
it
were
being
ground
between
stones
this
she
understood
was
what
she
must
suffer
because
she
had
used
her
powers
to
hurt
another
she
was
going
to
lose
white
bear
she
had
saved
him
from
death
he
was
going
to
live
but
not
with
her
the
claws
of
that
giant
bear
that
was
his
other
self
seemed
to
stab
into
her
chest
and
tear
her
in
two
she
could
not
live
with
this
pain
she
must
surrender
to
white
bear
i
must
stay
with
him
i
can
not
leave
him
eagle
feather
needs
him
we
will
be
safe
here
and
comfortable
and
at
she
would
send
for
eagle
feather
the
fat
aunt
and
the
grandfather
would
love
them
and
care
for
them
she
tried
to
see
herself
living
here
with
white
bear
for
a
moment
the
picture
was
clear
in
her
mind
then
it
dissolved
in
blackness
as
she
realized
that
taking
herself
out
of
the
sauk
tribe
would
be
like
pulling
a
medicine
plant
up
by
its
roots
without
its
consent
she
would
die
it
would
be
a
slow
death
that
would
be
worse
than
the
pain
she
was
suffering
now
and
then
another
thought
struck
her
her
heart
felt
heavy
as
a
mountain
she
remembered
how
owl
carver
had
said
after
eagle
feather
smoked
the
peace
pipe
with
the
winnebago
that
he
could
be
a
greater
shaman
than
any
of
them
but
that
would
happen
only
if
he
was
raised
as
a
sauk
floating
lily
was
dead
redbird
could
not
live
with
the
people
who
had
murdered
her
and
she
touched
her
belly
this
was
not
white
bear
child
she
began
to
cry
aloud
she
sobbed
till
she
thought
her
ribs
would
crack
her
throat
burned
her
voice
rasped
she
pressed
her
forehead
against
his
chest
she
heard
him
groan
in
pain
but
he
was
hurting
her
more
than
she
could
ever
hurt
him
how
can
you
ask
me
to
stay
where
they
killed
floating
lily
how
can
stay
here
what
would
you
have
me
do
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
her
the
pale
eyes
give
gold
for
land
take
pale
eyes
gold
for
this
land
and
you
can
take
the
gold
with
you
to
the
ioway
country
and
share
it
with
our
people
no
redbird
he
said
sadly
what
could
we
do
with
gold
out
there
in
ioway
sometimes
the
long
knives
have
given
our
chiefs
gold
in
return
for
land
yes
in
no
time
the
gold
melted
away
gold
by
itself
is
like
seed
corn
without
the
right
ground
to
plant
it
in
it
is
soon
used
up
and
gone
the
only
way
i
can
use
the
wealth
my
father
star
arrow
left
to
me
is
to
stay
here
and
work
with
it
she
had
stopped
crying
this
hurt
too
much
for
tears
only
when
floating
lily
was
killed
had
she
felt
more
pain
than
this
for
a
moment
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
the
words
she
had
to
say
from
somewhere
she
summoned
the
strength
to
speak
then
i
must
leave
you
each
word
she
felt
was
an
arrow
fired
into
him
his
arms
tightened
around
her
i
beg
you
to
stay
of
the
redbird
help
me
to
do
what
i
it
would
hurt
less
if
she
acted
at
once
she
pushed
herself
away
from
him
she
stood
up
and
crossed
the
room
to
the
closed
door
may
you
walk
always
in
honor
white
bear
no
redbird
no
was
crying
bitterly
now
and
he
rolled
over
and
buried
his
head
in
his
pillows
beating
the
bed
with
his
clenched
fists
she
could
not
bear
to
leave
him
weeping
like
this
like
a
child
she
was
abandoning
she
would
rather
see
him
angry
then
the
spirit
bird
whom
she
had
called
on
for
help
sent
her
a
message
she
saw
wolf
paw
as
he
had
looked
when
he
was
proud
and
undefeated
with
the
red
crest
on
his
head
a
red
blanket
wrapped
around
him
and
black
paint
around
his
eyes
did
i
never
see
it
before
wolf
paw
wore
the
markings
of
the
bird
she
was
named
after
the
bird
that
was
her
spirit
guide
neither
she
nor
he
had
been
aware
of
it
but
it
must
mean
that
they
were
destined
for
each
other
and
that
what
had
already
happened
between
herself
and
wolf
paw
to
happen
to
live
out
her
life
with
wolf
paw
and
never
to
see
white
bear
again
was
like
being
told
she
would
never
again
see
a
day
with
sunlight
but
it
was
as
the
spirit
bird
had
sung
to
her
must
happen
must
she
breathed
deeply
she
hated
having
to
tell
white
bear
about
wolf
paw
if
he
had
been
willing
to
come
with
her
she
would
not
have
had
to
say
anything
wolf
paw
would
not
have
tried
to
hold
her
and
if
she
gave
birth
a
moon
or
two
too
soon
white
bear
would
have
forgiven
her
but
now
she
had
to
use
wolf
paw
to
hurt
white
bear
to
hurt
him
so
as
to
heal
him
when
i
am
gone
from
here
who
will
heal
me
must
the
shaman
suffer
wounds
that
can
never
be
healed
if
she
has
dealt
such
you
would
not
want
me
anymore
white
bear
she
said
these
past
moons
since
you
left
us
i
have
been
wolf
paw
woman
he
raised
his
face
from
the
pillow
and
stared
at
her
what
are
you
saying
wolf
paw
lost
his
wives
and
his
children
at
the
bad
axe
he
was
like
a
dead
man
i
wanted
to
heal
him
and
i
will
heal
him
by
living
with
him
his
eyes
widened
she
could
see
anger
darkening
his
cheeks
he
said
after
my
father
took
me
to
live
here
you
waited
six
summers
for
me
while
wolf
paw
courted
you
could
you
not
keep
him
off
for
a
few
moons
she
held
out
her
hands
imploringly
before
when
he
was
an
honored
warrior
and
had
his
family
he
had
no
need
of
me
he
wanted
me
as
he
wanted
another
feather
to
hang
in
his
hair
but
now
he
needs
me
without
me
he
would
be
as
good
as
dead
and
he
is
the
last
brave
in
our
band
i
need
you
she
put
her
hands
over
her
belly
it
was
still
flat
but
she
knew
what
was
there
i
am
carrying
wolf
paw
child
he
pushed
against
the
bed
till
he
was
sitting
bolt
upright
and
he
pounded
his
fist
on
his
knee
he
was
still
badly
wounded
he
could
hurt
himself
what
if
he
tried
to
get
out
of
bed
and
tore
the
wound
open
but
when
he
looked
up
at
her
his
eyes
were
large
and
dark
with
sadness
i
still
love
you
whatever
you
did
with
wolf
paw
and
i
will
love
baby
you
bear
she
felt
his
hands
seize
her
heart
tearing
it
out
of
her
chest
crushing
it
she
cried
out
with
the
pain
and
staggered
backward
she
cried
you
offer
me
everything
but
the
one
thing
i
want
for
you
to
come
back
to
our
people
what
i
do
i
do
for
our
people
his
voice
was
so
low
that
she
could
barely
hear
him
one
sauk
at
least
will
take
back
land
the
pale
eyes
stole
from
us
the
world
grew
darker
and
darker
for
her
with
every
word
he
spoke
she
was
losing
him
a
little
more
she
made
the
no
gesture
the
pale
eyes
here
in
this
land
are
too
strong
for
the
red
people
and
in
you
there
is
both
pale
eyes
and
red
man
and
the
pale
eyes
is
stronger
than
the
red
his
shoulders
slumped
she
saw
a
dullness
in
his
eyes
that
made
her
think
of
wolf
paw
as
he
had
looked
after
the
people
of
victor
had
killed
floating
lily
i
hurt
white
bear
so
badly
that
he
will
get
sick
again
sudden
fear
rippled
through
her
but
then
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
her
and
there
was
strength
in
his
gaunt
face
i
will
always
love
you
and
as
long
as
this
place
is
mine
there
will
be
a
home
here
for
you
for
eagle
feather
for
any
child
of
yours
for
any
sauk
when
you
go
back
tell
them
that
grief
crushed
her
as
she
gazed
at
the
man
she
loved
knowing
that
they
were
parting
forever
he
reached
out
to
her
and
she
went
back
to
lie
beside
him
on
the
bed
it
felt
so
good
to
be
held
by
him
and
it
hurt
so
much
to
know
that
this
was
the
last
time
they
would
ever
lie
heart
against
heart
she
thought
she
would
scream
at
the
agony
of
it
floating
lily
my
daughter
i
may
never
be
able
to
come
back
here
again
i
hope
you
have
begun
your
journey
west
but
if
your
spirit
lingers
here
know
that
your
father
is
close
redbird
stood
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
mound
of
earth
now
covered
with
leaves
the
strip
of
red
blanket
tied
to
the
willow
wand
now
faded
she
rocked
back
and
forth
in
the
pale
eyes
shoes
made
of
heavy
leather
that
yellow
hair
had
given
her
she
wailed
softly
in
her
sorrow
for
floating
lily
then
she
turned
to
yellow
hair
who
stood
under
a
nearby
maple
you
take
white
bear
here
and
show
him
yellow
hair
nodded
they
went
back
to
yellow
hair
carriage
the
buggy
was
laden
with
food
and
blankets
and
redbird
carried
with
her
a
heavy
bag
of
gold
coins
given
her
by
white
bear
grandfather
used
wisely
the
gold
would
buy
blankets
and
food
rifles
and
ammunition
from
the
traders
to
help
the
sauk
get
through
the
winter
now
they
would
not
have
to
winter
over
at
fort
armstrong
but
could
cross
over
at
once
to
join
the
rest
of
the
tribe
in
ioway
the
wound
in
redbird
heart
ached
constantly
and
she
sat
bent
forward
on
the
buggy
seat
her
hands
gripping
her
knees
as
they
rattled
down
the
road
to
fort
armstrong
she
felt
some
small
relief
at
leaving
the
place
where
she
had
lost
so
much
she
tried
to
tell
herself
that
she
was
on
the
way
to
a
new
life
yellow
hair
said
she
did
understand
why
white
bear
was
not
with
them
she
wanted
to
know
if
he
would
follow
redbird
when
he
got
better
understands
but
she
does
not
dare
believe
he
is
going
to
stay
with
her
she
thinks
it
is
too
much
to
hope
redbird
said
he
still
your
husband
yellow
hair
you
want
him
yellow
hair
lips
quivered
as
she
asked
would
redbird
not
come
back
to
be
with
white
bear
redbird
gritted
her
teeth
it
hurt
to
have
to
explain
to
yellow
hair
redbird
made
the
motion
he
not
follow
me
i
never
come
back
here
now
yellow
hair
eyes
were
glowing
like
turquoise
set
in
silver
but
she
put
a
comforting
hand
on
redbird
arm
she
wanted
to
know
why
how
could
redbird
part
from
white
bear
and
he
from
her
did
it
not
hurt
too
much
yes
hurt
much
said
redbird
softly
watching
the
rutted
dirt
road
pass
under
the
wheels
of
the
buggy
but
yellow
hair
pressed
her
how
could
white
bear
tear
himself
away
from
the
sauk
pale
eyes
family
now
his
people
but
his
son
how
could
he
give
up
his
son
redbird
struggled
to
find
words
and
gestures
to
explain
this
maybe
some
day
white
bear
come
for
eagle
feather
like
star
arrow
once
come
for
white
bear
she
remembered
how
white
bear
had
wept
when
sun
woman
told
him
he
must
go
to
live
with
the
pale
eyes
that
day
i
not
say
eagle
feather
must
go
or
must
not
go
eagle
feather
do
what
he
want
yellow
hair
shook
her
head
her
braids
lashing
she
repeated
over
and
over
again
an
english
word
redbird
understood
but
it
asked
a
question
she
could
never
answer
again
redbird
wrestled
with
the
english
words
land
of
his
father
and
grandfather
holds
him
he
not
want
to
leave
but
what
about
the
uncle
who
nearly
killed
him
that
uncle
no
more
trouble
said
redbird
because
of
that
i
must
lose
then
when
would
redbird
see
white
bear
again
yellow
hair
question
buried
itself
in
redbird
heart
like
a
steel
arrowhead
never
she
screamed
yellow
hair
shrank
back
her
eyes
wide
with
shock
redbird
sighed
and
let
her
body
droop
they
drove
on
in
silence
redbird
heard
small
sounds
beside
her
that
told
her
yellow
hair
was
weeping
redbird
reached
over
and
took
yellow
hair
hand
make
him
happy
yellow
hair
uttered
a
sob
and
turned
her
head
away
but
redbird
was
no
longer
crying
she
stared
ahead
at
the
road
south
her
sorrow
was
too
deep
for
tears
blood
on
the
land
raoul
françois
philippe
charles
de
marion
woke
trembling
in
damp
blackness
wondering
whether
it
was
day
or
night
outside
his
heart
was
beating
so
hard
that
it
ached
for
a
moment
he
could
think
what
had
scared
him
so
badly
then
he
remembered
the
dream
he
struggled
out
of
the
old
blanket
he
wrapped
around
himself
and
sat
up
panting
a
white
bear
coming
at
him
down
here
in
the
mine
why
in
hell
would
he
dream
about
a
creature
like
that
there
were
white
bears
up
in
canada
he
heard
but
he
never
even
seen
one
white
bear
that
was
auguste
indian
name
was
he
dreaming
about
auguste
coming
after
him
auguste
is
rotting
in
the
ground
now
i
killed
he
still
hated
auguste
even
after
his
death
because
of
auguste
he
had
to
stay
holed
up
here
blackness
pressing
on
his
eyeballs
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
he
stared
till
they
hurt
but
he
could
see
nothing
nothing
at
all
it
was
like
being
blind
he
wished
he
had
told
just
one
of
his
men
where
to
find
him
he
badly
wanted
news
of
what
was
going
on
back
at
victor
but
if
he
told
anyone
it
would
have
been
armand
and
he
could
trust
the
bastard
armand
might
stupidly
let
himself
be
followed
here
or
give
way
to
threats
or
even
sell
him
out
if
papa
offered
a
big
enough
reward
would
sure
he
would
i
could
see
in
his
eyes
how
he
resented
me
he
hated
pierre
and
he
hated
me
raoul
only
had
two
candles
left
should
he
light
one
now
he
could
spare
it
because
he
was
going
to
get
out
of
this
mine
today
or
tonight
waited
long
enough
he
was
sure
anymore
how
long
he
been
hiding
down
here
in
the
dark
when
he
slept
he
had
no
idea
how
long
he
slept
a
watch
was
one
of
the
many
things
he
had
forgotten
to
bring
with
him
leaving
in
such
a
hurry
and
yet
he
stupidly
brought
the
silver
case
with
pierre
spectacles
in
it
stuck
it
in
his
pocket
when
he
left
the
trading
post
to
get
the
mongrel
he
felt
it
now
a
hard
oval
in
his
coat
pocket
how
long
the
men
pursuing
him
had
searched
the
mine
as
he
figured
they
would
days
had
passed
he
was
sure
since
he
heard
their
voices
in
the
mine
footsteps
echoing
he
was
certain
he
was
the
only
man
in
victor
who
knew
about
the
tunnel
he
was
hiding
in
its
entrance
just
big
enough
to
crawl
through
covered
by
a
pile
of
gravel
that
appeared
to
have
nothing
but
wall
behind
it
he
tried
to
disturb
the
gravel
as
little
as
possible
while
crawling
in
and
had
carefully
replaced
what
he
pushed
aside
but
he
might
have
left
some
trace
on
the
other
side
he
sat
in
the
blackness
waiting
to
hear
the
sounds
of
digging
his
back
pressed
against
the
damp
rock
wall
knees
drawn
up
to
his
chin
his
hands
cold
as
if
they
been
plunged
into
a
snowdrift
had
rested
on
his
loaded
rifle
and
his
pistol
and
he
drawn
his
bowie
knife
and
laid
it
beside
him
they
pay
dearly
to
take
him
if
there
were
no
more
than
four
or
five
of
them
he
might
manage
to
kill
them
all
and
get
away
but
the
sounds
of
the
search
party
had
faded
away
he
welcomed
the
black
cotton
silence
that
had
followed
he
would
stay
down
here
as
long
as
he
could
he
found
a
place
in
his
tunnel
where
underground
water
had
seeped
in
and
was
able
to
keep
refilling
his
canteen
from
that
he
found
another
small
branch
tunnel
some
distance
from
where
he
slept
where
he
could
piss
and
shit
but
he
come
into
the
mine
with
only
six
candles
and
he
was
afraid
to
use
them
up
so
he
spent
most
of
the
time
sitting
in
the
dark
feeling
as
if
he
was
going
mad
with
alternating
worry
and
boredom
he
had
brought
his
canteen
of
whiskey
down
here
with
him
and
it
had
made
time
pass
easier
for
a
while
but
now
it
was
all
gone
seemed
like
a
hell
of
a
long
time
since
he
had
a
drink
he
made
a
flame
with
flint
steel
and
cotton
wool
lit
his
next
to
last
candle
and
set
it
in
a
pool
of
its
own
wax
the
light
hurt
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
the
sight
of
his
own
shadow
moving
on
the
dark
gray
rock
walls
frightened
him
his
hollow
belly
kept
squealing
and
grumbling
and
visions
of
beef
and
turkey
and
duck
and
pork
tormented
him
out
of
one
of
his
saddlebags
he
took
the
bundle
of
corn
biscuits
and
dried
beef
he
thrown
together
at
the
trading
post
in
his
flight
he
bit
into
a
biscuit
as
hard
and
dry
as
a
lump
of
wood
and
rolled
it
around
in
his
mouth
until
his
saliva
softened
it
enough
to
chew
and
swallow
now
he
go
up
to
the
mine
entrance
and
if
it
was
nighttime
he
leave
the
flemings
had
their
cabin
about
a
mile
from
here
their
men
had
joined
the
regulators
so
they
deserved
to
have
him
take
a
horse
from
them
then
he
ride
north
to
galena
he
hefted
the
other
saddlebag
loaded
with
gold
and
silver
coins
and
bank
of
illinois
paper
he
had
to
leave
a
lot
behind
in
his
office
safe
and
they
probably
steal
it
from
him
but
he
get
it
all
back
because
this
was
enough
to
buy
him
an
army
galena
would
be
crowded
with
the
roughest
men
in
the
northwest
territory
right
now
surely
more
men
than
could
make
a
living
in
the
mines
around
there
boom
or
no
boom
rough
and
hungry
just
what
he
needed
yet
see
that
cooper
swinging
from
a
tree
and
piss
on
auguste
he
bit
into
a
slice
of
dried
beef
it
was
tough
as
rawhide
but
he
forced
it
down
i
running
things
in
smith
county
again
nicole
and
frank
and
that
pack
of
squalling
brats
are
leaving
i
put
up
with
frank
and
his
damned
newspaper
long
enough
just
because
he
married
to
my
if
frank
gave
any
trouble
his
new
press
the
one
papa
helped
him
buy
would
end
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
mississippi
or
maybe
he
even
be
cooper
dancing
partner
on
that
tree
knocked
my
father
down
i
killed
my
brother
squaw
and
his
mongrel
bastard
son
why
put
up
with
my
sister
and
her
husband
what
have
they
ever
done
except
hate
me
and
the
old
man
would
have
to
go
too
if
he
was
still
alive
and
that
bag
of
bones
guichard
time
to
be
rid
of
them
all
de
marion
would
still
be
the
foremost
name
in
smith
county
but
it
would
be
a
new
de
marion
family
not
this
old
bunch
that
understood
nothing
nancy
what
about
her
the
teacher
needed
to
be
taught
a
lesson
or
two
if
she
had
let
auguste
service
her
when
she
was
captured
by
the
injuns
then
probably
never
had
a
man
cock
up
inside
her
once
she
found
out
what
pleasure
he
could
give
her
she
forget
about
auguste
she
was
still
young
enough
for
children
children
and
smart
that
brat
woodrow
that
she
had
living
with
her
imagine
him
saying
in
court
that
the
redskins
treated
him
better
than
his
parents
did
send
him
packing
just
like
the
hopkinses
with
smith
county
and
with
nancy
all
his
it
would
be
time
to
rebuild
victoire
he
put
that
off
because
he
wanted
to
do
it
right
and
he
left
the
ruin
till
now
to
remind
himself
and
everyone
in
victor
why
the
sauk
had
to
be
driven
out
of
illinois
no
that
was
a
damned
lie
alone
here
in
the
dark
he
could
not
keep
the
truth
from
pecking
at
his
brain
like
a
buzzard
beak
every
time
he
went
near
the
ruin
of
the
château
he
thought
of
clarissa
and
the
boys
and
guilt
stabbed
him
without
mercy
he
looked
down
on
clarissa
and
he
had
not
felt
for
the
boys
as
a
father
should
he
left
them
unprotected
let
them
die
horribly
just
as
helene
had
died
did
to
andy
and
phil
just
what
papa
and
pierre
did
to
me
when
my
boys
needed
me
most
i
was
the
sauk
never
would
have
attacked
victor
if
i
had
shot
auguste
and
the
other
two
redskins
at
old
man
he
forced
himself
to
stop
thinking
about
the
family
he
made
without
wanting
to
and
then
had
lost
their
blood
was
spilled
and
nothing
would
bring
them
back
he
shed
plenty
of
indian
blood
to
avenge
them
he
remembered
the
indian
witch
woman
auguste
mother
the
bowie
knife
slicing
open
her
throat
her
blood
warm
on
his
hand
what
curse
had
she
laid
on
him
before
he
killed
her
he
put
her
out
of
his
mind
and
thought
of
victoire
when
he
rebuilt
victoire
it
would
not
be
just
another
blockhouse
but
a
stone
mansion
that
could
be
seen
from
the
river
it
would
be
the
center
of
raoul
de
marion
new
empire
steamships
railroads
cattle
farmlands
mines
now
that
the
indians
were
gone
for
good
now
that
pierre
bastard
was
dead
there
was
no
limit
to
what
raoul
could
make
of
the
wealth
the
dreams
heartened
him
time
to
move
he
stuffed
the
little
bundle
of
beef
and
biscuit
into
one
saddlebag
he
slung
the
saddlebags
over
his
shoulder
the
light
one
with
food
hanging
down
his
front
the
heavy
one
with
the
money
in
it
on
his
back
he
loosened
the
bowie
knife
in
its
sheath
on
his
left
hip
he
checked
the
loads
in
his
pistol
and
his
rifle
again
as
he
pushed
back
his
coat
to
holster
his
pistol
he
felt
spectacle
case
in
his
pocket
the
hell
am
i
carrying
that
around
for
at
times
he
suspected
that
he
kept
pierre
spectacles
because
he
really
did
love
his
older
brother
in
spite
of
everything
pierre
had
done
to
him
the
silver
case
he
told
himself
was
valuable
but
the
spectacles
were
worthless
the
eyes
that
had
needed
them
had
stopped
seeing
a
year
ago
they
he
opened
the
case
the
lenses
glinted
in
the
candlelight
as
if
there
were
eyes
behind
them
goddamn
it
he
shouted
and
turned
the
case
over
dropping
the
spectacles
to
the
stone
floor
they
shattered
with
a
crack
that
sounded
loud
as
a
pistol
shot
he
stamped
on
them
for
good
measure
crushing
the
glass
to
glittering
splinters
and
twisting
the
frames
out
of
shape
under
the
sole
of
his
boot
he
threw
the
case
into
a
pile
of
rock
shards
valuable
or
not
he
want
the
damned
thing
anymore
i
hope
you
in
hell
pierre
he
did
love
pierre
he
hated
him
he
never
loved
him
he
always
hated
him
ever
since
fort
dearborn
holding
the
bit
of
candle
high
in
his
left
hand
his
rifle
in
his
right
he
started
up
the
sloping
tunnel
it
was
a
long
climb
the
sacks
of
coins
in
the
saddlebag
on
his
back
weighed
him
down
he
stopped
at
the
gravel
pile
that
blocked
entry
to
this
tunnel
he
listened
and
heard
nothing
but
his
blood
hissing
in
his
ears
he
scraped
chunks
of
stone
away
from
the
pile
until
he
could
crawl
through
after
more
walking
and
climbing
through
tunnels
and
shafts
he
no
longer
had
any
notion
how
long
it
had
been
since
he
left
his
hideout
he
saw
ahead
a
little
square
of
gray
in
the
center
of
the
black
all
around
him
and
then
he
could
make
out
the
walls
and
floor
of
the
tunnel
moonlight
or
starlight
must
be
illuminating
the
mine
entrance
night
then
good
he
could
leave
at
once
about
twenty
feet
from
the
entrance
he
saw
up
ahead
an
opening
where
another
tunnel
branched
off
from
this
one
he
remembered
it
this
was
the
side
tunnel
where
the
indian
he
killed
seven
years
ago
had
hidden
as
he
came
close
to
that
opening
he
heard
a
rumbling
sound
the
growl
of
an
animal
he
felt
as
if
he
been
doused
with
water
he
took
a
few
steps
back
from
the
branch
tunnel
opening
curled
his
finger
around
the
trigger
of
his
rifle
and
raised
it
he
did
want
to
let
go
of
the
candle
it
had
just
been
a
dream
there
something
in
this
mine
maybe
a
wolf
or
a
bear
would
like
a
deserted
mine
like
this
for
a
den
he
heard
snuffling
grunting
noises
then
a
growl
so
deep
it
seemed
to
shake
the
stone
under
his
feet
he
felt
his
stomach
clench
and
he
nearly
lost
his
grip
on
his
bowels
claws
scraped
on
rock
with
trembling
fingers
he
set
the
candle
in
one
of
the
wall
niches
the
miners
had
carved
for
their
lanterns
and
raised
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
the
bear
came
out
of
the
branch
tunnel
he
saw
the
huge
pointed
white
head
from
the
side
at
first
with
a
golden
eye
that
glared
at
him
a
perfectly
white
bear
like
his
dream
the
head
swung
toward
him
a
gaping
mouth
lined
with
teeth
like
ivory
daggers
the
whole
white
body
emerged
bigger
than
a
bull
bison
it
roared
deafening
as
a
cannon
blast
it
reared
up
on
its
hind
legs
filling
the
tunnel
like
a
white
avalanche
after
the
roar
it
rumbled
steadily
deep
in
its
chest
though
it
was
more
than
ten
feet
away
he
could
smell
its
breath
he
squeezed
the
trigger
his
rifle
thundered
echoes
slamming
the
sides
of
his
head
smoke
obscured
the
vast
white
body
his
ears
jangled
he
felt
a
sudden
terror
that
the
shot
might
start
a
but
it
did
it
did
stop
the
bear
either
it
came
on
padded
feet
scraping
on
the
tunnel
floor
swinging
claws
like
rows
of
sickles
could
have
missed
oh
jesus
oh
god
i
could
he
threw
the
rifle
down
snatched
his
pistol
out
of
his
holster
and
fired
again
blinding
flash
deafening
blast
stinking
smoke
and
the
bear
kept
coming
it
was
so
close
the
lead
balls
have
gone
into
it
it
must
be
just
so
damned
big
it
would
take
more
than
two
shots
to
kill
it
but
there
was
no
time
to
reload
the
bear
towered
over
him
white
body
filling
the
whole
world
eyes
claws
teeth
all
shining
in
the
glow
of
that
pitiful
little
candle
that
somehow
had
stayed
lit
he
screamed
and
sobbed
like
a
little
boy
in
his
terror
but
he
managed
to
get
his
bowie
knife
out
he
killed
a
big
indian
with
this
knife
a
paw
the
size
of
his
head
knocked
the
knife
from
his
hand
oh
please
do
kill
me
he
wept
for
the
love
of
jesus
the
other
paw
hit
his
chest
like
a
sledgehammer
he
felt
his
ribs
cave
in
he
felt
the
claws
stab
into
his
lungs
his
breath
flew
from
his
body
his
strength
drained
away
he
scream
anymore
he
could
beg
for
his
life
his
voice
was
gone
only
blood
came
out
of
his
throat
the
last
thing
he
saw
was
an
enormous
mouth
gaping
full
of
pointed
teeth
coming
at
him
he
felt
claws
rip
again
through
his
chest
and
belly
and
knew
that
he
was
going
the
pale
eyes
smoke
boat
was
a
frightening
thing
shooting
black
clouds
and
sparks
from
two
iron
tubes
that
rose
up
from
a
big
lodge
in
its
middle
on
each
side
of
the
boat
was
a
wheel
with
wooden
boards
attached
and
the
wheels
and
boards
pushed
the
boat
through
the
water
standing
on
the
floor
of
wood
planks
at
the
front
end
of
the
boat
redbird
tried
to
understand
how
fire
in
the
boat
belly
could
make
wheels
turn
she
felt
the
monstrous
thing
tremble
under
her
as
it
swam
across
the
river
about
a
hundred
women
and
children
with
a
few
men
were
crowded
at
the
front
of
the
boat
watching
the
ioway
shore
of
the
great
river
come
closer
by
unspoken
agreement
they
kept
their
backs
turned
to
the
land
that
had
once
been
so
good
to
them
the
land
they
had
forever
lost
happy
land
that
was
redbird
thought
at
the
memory
of
white
bear
grief
stabbed
her
and
she
had
to
rest
against
the
railing
of
the
boat
she
felt
an
aching
hollow
as
if
she
had
been
gutted
like
a
butchered
deer
in
their
midst
rose
a
little
mountain
of
boxes
barrels
sacks
and
bales
the
supplies
they
had
bought
with
white
bear
gold
but
they
had
no
horses
and
when
they
got
to
the
ioway
shore
they
would
have
to
carry
these
goods
on
their
backs
a
journey
of
probably
four
days
across
the
strip
of
land
by
the
river
that
he
who
moves
alertly
had
surrendered
to
the
long
knives
somewhere
beyond
that
land
they
would
find
the
sauk
and
fox
who
had
been
wise
enough
not
to
follow
black
hawk
she
hoped
it
would
not
start
to
snow
before
they
reached
the
camps
of
their
people
wolf
paw
said
i
have
heard
that
this
is
the
very
boat
that
killed
so
many
of
our
people
at
the
bad
axe
this
boat
had
killed
his
wives
and
his
children
then
thought
redbird
she
rested
her
hand
on
his
arm
see
there
he
said
pointing
to
holes
and
black
marks
on
the
wood
at
the
very
front
end
a
thunder
gun
was
set
there
it
fired
at
our
people
and
tore
them
to
pieces
like
the
one
that
killed
so
many
of
our
warriors
at
the
pale
eyes
town
through
his
worn
buckskin
shirt
he
touched
the
silver
coin
that
still
hung
around
his
neck
on
a
leather
thong
redbird
remembered
the
day
white
bear
had
dug
the
coin
out
of
wolf
paw
body
claiming
he
had
changed
a
lead
ball
into
a
coin
she
put
her
hand
on
her
aching
heart
would
things
ever
stop
reminding
her
of
white
bear
she
stared
down
at
the
water
rushing
by
the
side
of
the
boat
and
it
made
her
dizzy
a
canoe
could
never
travel
this
fast
even
a
big
one
paddled
by
many
men
and
a
canoe
could
never
go
straight
across
the
river
without
being
pushed
downstream
by
the
current
as
this
boat
was
doing
had
she
been
wrong
not
to
stay
with
white
bear
as
he
had
begged
her
to
she
missed
him
so
much
tears
came
to
her
eyes
she
hoped
wolf
paw
and
eagle
feather
would
not
see
her
crying
and
she
wiped
her
eyes
quickly
she
felt
like
jumping
from
this
boat
and
swimming
back
to
shore
if
she
drowned
in
the
great
river
even
that
would
be
better
than
being
carried
away
from
white
bear
she
told
herself
she
had
made
up
her
mind
she
was
determined
to
be
a
sauk
for
the
rest
of
her
days
and
eagle
feather
would
be
a
sauk
bear
is
wrong
to
stay
behind
even
for
all
that
eagle
feather
gripped
her
arm
do
not
be
afraid
mother
the
pale
eyes
will
not
hurt
us
today
his
blue
eyes
were
sad
he
must
have
noticed
her
misery
wolf
paw
smiled
faintly
no
today
they
only
want
to
be
rid
of
us
eagle
feather
said
one
day
earthmaker
will
give
us
a
medicine
so
strong
that
the
long
knives
guns
will
not
hurt
us
redbird
smiled
at
her
son
may
it
be
you
who
finds
that
medicine
can
hope
for
that
now
that
we
have
lost
so
much
the
spirits
might
grant
us
new
powers
that
will
help
us
to
resist
the
pale
of
one
thing
she
was
sure
white
bear
way
was
not
a
trail
that
the
people
should
travel
for
a
sauk
to
become
a
pale
eyes
was
a
kind
of
death
are
sauk
or
we
are
nothing
white
bear
is
no
longer
a
sauk
my
husband
is
she
turned
back
to
wolf
paw
and
eagle
feather
she
did
not
like
to
see
wolf
paw
hair
hanging
loose
around
his
head
his
slumped
shoulders
he
had
always
stood
so
straight
before
the
people
at
victor
killed
floating
lily
she
put
her
hand
on
his
back
and
stroked
it
with
a
circular
motion
and
he
straightened
his
shoulders
as
he
looked
at
her
a
light
dawned
in
his
eyes
she
must
get
him
to
shave
his
head
again
to
put
the
red
crest
back
in
place
the
people
needed
a
new
leader
a
true
leader
black
hawk
had
been
wrong
too
many
times
and
he
who
moves
alertly
would
do
whatever
the
pale
eyes
told
him
to
do
wolf
paw
would
help
her
heal
the
people
i
hated
him
the
night
he
mocked
white
bear
putting
a
woman
dress
on
him
but
he
has
suffered
much
since
then
and
he
is
a
wiser
man
eagle
feather
was
standing
at
the
rail
looking
across
the
purple
river
at
the
hills
on
the
ioway
shore
redbird
moved
to
stand
behind
him
and
put
her
hands
on
his
small
square
shoulders
he
held
himself
very
straight
eagle
feather
said
suddenly
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
my
father
one
last
time
she
could
barely
hear
him
above
the
noise
of
the
smoke
boat
and
the
rushing
water
she
closed
her
eyes
against
the
pain
of
that
and
bit
her
lower
lip
to
keep
it
from
trembling
when
she
was
able
to
speak
she
said
i
think
that
one
day
you
will
see
him
again
but
for
now
eagle
feather
and
white
bear
must
be
parted
because
eagle
feather
must
grow
up
as
a
sauk
the
people
would
need
him
too
in
summers
and
winters
to
come
but
until
eagle
feather
was
grown
the
people
would
turn
to
her
the
men
like
wolf
paw
had
lost
heart
she
would
give
them
heart
again
in
spite
of
the
pale
eyes
the
sauk
would
find
a
good
trail
the
walk
from
grandpapa
house
to
the
ruins
of
victoire
seemed
to
auguste
to
take
all
morning
by
the
time
he
stood
facing
the
blackened
chimney
that
towered
over
him
like
some
ancient
idol
his
legs
hurt
he
was
panting
but
the
crisp
winter
air
infused
vigor
into
his
nostrils
and
lungs
he
sat
down
to
rest
on
a
broken
beam
that
had
once
held
up
the
ceiling
of
the
great
hall
he
was
still
weak
from
having
been
so
badly
wounded
and
from
lying
in
bed
recovering
and
even
now
his
left
lung
was
still
not
able
to
fill
itself
full
with
air
and
probably
never
would
be
this
was
the
farthest
he
had
ever
walked
too
far
really
but
the
bright
december
day
invited
him
out
of
doors
and
he
wanted
to
see
his
land
it
was
his
now
without
question
now
that
raoul
body
had
been
found
he
was
glad
there
had
been
no
marks
on
the
body
glad
that
the
fleming
children
who
had
found
it
day
before
yesterday
while
playing
down
in
the
gorge
had
had
to
see
a
human
body
torn
to
pieces
as
he
feared
raoul
might
be
found
ginnie
the
middle
fleming
girl
had
followed
a
cardinal
into
the
mine
entrance
once
the
child
had
seen
the
body
the
little
redbird
had
flown
out
again
and
disappeared
raoul
rifle
and
his
pistol
both
of
which
he
apparently
had
fired
just
before
he
died
lay
beside
him
his
bowie
knife
had
fallen
a
short
distance
away
as
if
he
had
thrown
it
when
auguste
and
grandpapa
had
gone
to
see
the
body
laid
out
in
surrey
examining
room
auguste
had
been
shocked
to
see
the
grimace
of
terror
frozen
on
raoul
face
jaws
wide
apart
lips
drawn
back
from
his
teeth
eyes
bulging
a
good
thing
the
light
in
the
mine
had
been
dim
and
the
fleming
girl
had
gotten
a
good
look
at
that
face
auguste
and
surrey
had
both
carefully
examined
the
body
and
could
find
no
cause
of
death
surrey
opined
that
raoul
had
gone
mad
hiding
in
the
mine
and
had
been
frightened
to
death
by
his
own
hallucinations
auguste
knew
what
had
killed
raoul
he
vividly
remembered
his
wanderings
in
the
other
world
in
that
endless
prairie
with
redbird
auguste
could
only
imagine
what
the
encounter
between
raoul
and
the
white
bear
had
been
like
it
had
taken
place
in
the
other
world
the
white
bear
spirit
must
have
attacked
and
destroyed
raoul
soul
if
a
soul
could
be
destroyed
like
the
men
on
spirit
journeys
who
died
because
their
souls
never
returned
to
their
bodies
raoul
body
had
been
deprived
of
life
the
white
bear
could
leave
its
mark
in
this
world
when
it
chose
but
usually
it
left
tangible
signs
as
a
mark
of
favor
this
time
the
only
mark
it
had
left
was
that
look
of
terror
on
dead
face
and
auguste
had
paid
the
price
for
having
sent
the
white
bear
against
raoul
he
had
lost
redbird
the
rest
of
my
life
i
will
never
see
a
cardinal
without
my
heart
breaking
all
over
they
would
bury
raoul
with
a
mass
in
the
little
cemetery
overlooking
the
river
just
like
any
other
member
of
the
de
marion
family
there
would
be
no
revenge
after
death
père
isaac
was
coming
up
from
kaskaskia
to
officiate
i
afraid
it
will
not
be
long
before
grandpapa
lies
down
to
rest
not
far
from
even
as
auguste
had
begun
to
get
out
of
bed
and
walk
about
elysée
seemed
to
be
spending
more
and
more
time
sleeping
one
day
auguste
expected
he
would
simply
not
wake
up
at
all
though
he
mourned
in
expectation
of
the
old
man
passing
it
was
with
a
warm
feeling
that
elysée
had
done
much
had
walked
a
long
trail
with
honor
it
was
now
right
that
his
spirit
move
on
and
his
body
return
to
the
earth
am
thinking
like
a
and
then
it
all
swept
over
him
in
a
wave
of
anguish
he
saw
the
happiness
he
had
lost
he
saw
the
gardens
and
long
houses
of
saukenuk
cool
and
pleasant
in
the
summer
the
warm
winter
wickiups
in
ioway
the
hunting
and
fishing
the
feasts
the
dances
the
beloved
faces
drew
close
before
his
eyes
sun
woman
floating
lily
eagle
feather
owl
carver
black
hawk
redbird
he
gave
an
agonized
shout
that
reverberated
in
the
stone
chimney
that
towered
over
him
he
beat
his
chest
with
his
fist
again
and
again
until
a
bolt
of
pain
shot
through
him
where
raoul
bullet
had
pierced
him
he
did
not
want
to
stop
hurting
himself
but
he
could
not
hit
his
chest
anymore
his
head
hung
down
and
he
sobbed
brokenly
he
had
sacrificed
too
much
he
had
given
up
everything
he
really
loved
to
become
a
prisoner
of
this
place
he
was
trapped
on
this
land
the
ancient
wealth
of
the
de
marions
held
him
in
golden
chains
could
ride
away
from
all
this
even
now
i
could
take
a
horse
and
swim
it
across
the
mississippi
the
great
river
and
i
could
find
the
sauk
and
live
with
them
again
i
could
be
redbird
had
said
she
had
become
wolf
paw
woman
anger
boiled
him
at
the
thought
of
that
but
he
knew
it
was
the
healer
in
her
who
had
chosen
that
path
as
she
had
said
wolf
paw
was
one
of
the
last
braves
of
the
british
band
and
by
healing
him
she
healed
the
people
and
was
he
not
lying
to
himself
to
think
he
could
do
anything
for
the
sauk
here
how
could
he
resist
the
immense
power
of
men
like
sharp
knife
who
he
was
sure
were
bent
on
exterminating
the
sauk
on
exterminating
all
the
red
people
on
this
continent
to
make
the
de
marion
estate
prosper
he
would
have
to
learn
to
perform
a
thousand
tasks
about
which
he
knew
almost
nothing
he
must
give
all
his
heart
and
mind
and
strength
to
this
domain
if
it
was
to
flourish
that
was
the
burden
star
arrow
pierre
de
marion
had
laid
on
him
in
taking
up
that
burden
might
he
not
forget
his
other
tie
to
the
sauk
so
far
away
but
it
was
his
being
a
sauk
that
chained
him
so
irrevocably
to
victoire
the
afternoon
he
smoked
the
calumet
with
star
arrow
the
turtle
calling
on
him
to
be
guardian
of
this
land
somehow
he
must
try
both
to
be
master
of
victoire
and
to
fulfill
his
destiny
as
a
sauk
land
right
here
once
belonged
to
my
people
if
i
leave
it
it
will
never
belong
to
them
will
dedicate
my
possessions
to
them
i
will
send
them
what
they
need
i
will
use
the
influence
my
wealth
gives
me
with
the
lawyers
and
politicians
to
protect
them
so
they
will
never
be
driven
from
their
land
again
never
be
massacred
he
stood
up
and
walked
away
from
the
charred
wreckage
of
victoire
into
the
fields
that
surrounded
it
the
farmhands
had
planted
corn
last
spring
but
the
sauk
raiders
had
burned
it
and
some
prairie
grass
had
come
back
it
had
only
had
time
to
grow
chest
high
before
the
frost
killed
it
and
as
he
pushed
his
way
through
it
he
could
see
fields
beyond
where
the
yellow
horizon
met
the
sky
nancy
would
share
this
land
with
him
she
would
love
him
and
they
would
raise
woodrow
together
and
have
children
of
their
own
he
loved
nancy
though
there
were
places
in
him
that
only
redbird
could
touch
those
places
would
be
sealed
off
now
hand
in
hand
nancy
and
he
would
walk
their
path
together
the
world
was
all
before
them
where
to
choose
their
place
of
rest
and
providence
their
guide
they
hand
in
hand
with
steps
and
slow
through
eden
took
their
solitary
way
but
he
would
never
stop
missing
redbird
and
eagle
feather
and
he
would
never
stop
wishing
he
could
live
out
his
life
as
a
sauk
inwardly
he
would
always
be
a
sauk
the
bear
spirit
would
always
be
with
him
to
guide
him
failed
the
sauk
when
they
needed
me
i
warned
them
not
to
go
to
war
but
i
could
not
make
them
listen
they
need
a
shaman
who
will
make
them
he
thought
of
the
many
more
than
a
thousand
who
had
died
following
black
hawk
and
a
sudden
crushing
grief
struck
him
to
his
knees
he
wailed
stretching
his
arms
wide
and
lifting
his
face
up
to
look
at
long
faint
streaks
of
cloud
that
stretched
across
the
sky
he
tore
open
his
coat
and
his
shirt
kneeling
he
could
see
only
a
patch
of
blue
directly
overhead
framed
by
the
tassels
of
the
prairie
grass
that
rose
up
all
around
him
staring
up
into
the
blue
he
wailed
for
the
dead
for
a
long
time
he
felt
something
wet
running
down
his
chest
he
felt
the
cold
grip
of
fear
on
his
heart
when
he
had
struck
his
breast
before
had
he
reopened
the
hole
raoul
bullet
made
he
looked
down
beads
of
dark
red
were
pushing
their
way
through
the
five
claw
scars
further
down
his
chest
they
ran
together
as
rivulets
five
streams
of
blood
trickled
down
his
stomach
the
sight
of
flowing
blood
lifted
his
heart
it
was
a
sign
that
the
bear
spirit
was
still
with
him
he
bent
forward
and
put
out
his
hands
to
grip
the
land
at
the
roots
of
the
prairie
grass
his
fingers
dug
into
the
ashes
of
corn
stalks
and
the
roots
of
grass
a
bright
red
spot
appeared
on
the
ground
between
his
hands
and
knees
and
then
another
blood
drips
into
the
soil
i
give
myself
to
this
i
hold
this
land
for
the
sauk
nation
he

sheath
at
his
waist
the

left
him
long
ago
standing
he
could
see
over
the
waving
grass
he
flourished
the
knife
blade
at
the
vast
dome
of
sky
covering
the
prairie
he
faced
toward
the
east
whence
came
those
waves
of
pale
eyes
that
had
driven
his
people
from
their
homes
whence

long
as

lived
he
would
give
his
blood
to
this
earth
afterword
the
reader
may
suspect
the
author
of
a
bit
of
exaggeration
with
one
president
and
three
future
presidents
two
of
the
united
states
and
one
of
the
confederacy
playing
parts
in
this

it
a
historic
fact
that
colonel
zachary
taylor
and
lieutenant
jefferson
davis
were
among
the
regular
army
officers
who
pursued
black

not
to

few
months
after

of
major
eastern
cities
including
baltimore
philadelphia
and

the
crowds
that
came
to
see
black

greeted
him
as
if
he
was
a
conquering
hero
somewhat
to
jackson
chagrin
but

his
political
opponents

one
of

other
than

the
most
historically
prominent
sauk
in
these
pages
is
he
who
moves
alertly
for
the
sake
of
consistency
translated
all
the
native
american
names
in
the

otherwise
you
have
met

he
better
known
by
keokuk
and
i
would
have
referred
to
shooting
star
the
shawnee

chief
mentioned
in
chapters
five
and
sixteen
as
tecumseh
but
then
i
have
had
to
call

by
his
sauk
name
makataimeshekiakiak
no
wonder
emerson
called

a
hobgoblin
also
an
unfamiliar
name
today
is
michigan
territory
as
a
term
for
the
land
north
of
illinois
through
which
black
hawk
and
his
people
made
their
final
trek
from
the
trembling
lands
to
the
mouth
of
the
bad
axe
that
land
would
soon
become
the
state
of
wisconsin
after
achieving
statehood
in
wisconsin
promptly
laid
claim
to
the
prosperous
northern
portion
of
illinois
including
chicago
but
illinois
politicians
knew
all
about
clout
even
then
and
beat
the
badgers
back
large
parts
of
illinois
and
wisconsin
were
lands
previously
occupied
by
the
sauk
and
fox
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
sauk
migrated
from
canada
driven
by
wars
with
the
iroquois
down
into
what
is
today
eastern
wisconsin
during
the
eighteenth
century
they
formed
a
confederacy
with
the
fox
and
moved
into
the
southwestern
part
of
wisconsin
and
northern
illinois
in
black
hawk
time
there
were
about
four
thousand
sauk
and
sixteen
hundred
fox
living
in
villages
along
the
wisconsin
earlier
spelled
ouisconsin
and
mississippi
rivers
and
at
the
mouth
of
the
rock
river
with
the
louisiana
purchase
of
the
took
charge
of
the
sauk
and
fox
homeland
in
white
settlers
attacked
a
party
of
sauk
men
women
and
children
and
three
whites
were
killed
as
territorial
governor
william
henry
harrison
demanded
a
delegation
of
five
sauk
and
fox
chiefs
brought
one
of
the
accused
killers
to
louis
harrison
used
the
occasion
to
negotiate
a
treaty
in
which
the
sauk
and
fox
ceded
to
the
all
their
land
east
of
the
mississippi
including
what
is
today
northwestern
illinois
and
southwestern
wisconsin
as
well
as
a
portion
of
missouri
all
together
the
sauk
gave
up
million
acres
for
this
they
got
and
an
annual
payment
of
worth
of
goods
later
one
of
the
chiefs
who
had
signed
the
treaty
said
that
the
delegation
had
been
drunk
most
of
the
time
they
were
in
louis
the
prisoner
the
chiefs
had
delivered
to
harrison
was
killed
while
trying
to
escape
black
hawk
never
recognized
this
treaty
or
later
confirmations
of
it
in
defiance
he
led
his
people
back
to
saukenuk
every
spring
there
is
a
gaudy
rural
playground
area
in
wisconsin
known
as
the
wisconsin
dells
where
local
folks
will
show
tourists
a
cave
in
which
they
swear
black
hawk
was
hiding
when
captured
by
two
winnebago
warriors
named
chaetar
and
one
eye
decorah
but
nancy
lurie
of
the
milwaukee
public
museum
has
unearthed
a
different
account
of
black
hawk
surrender
written
by
john
blackhawk
grandson
of
a
winnebago
chief
and
no
relation
to
the
sauk
leader
i
find
the
john
blackhawk
version
much
more
probable
than
the
wisconsin
dells
story
and
it
the
one
i
followed
adding
inevitably
my
own
fictional
elaborations
be
it
noted
that
the
incident
of
the
small
boy
who
commits
black
party
to
surrendering
by
smoking
wave
peace
pipe
is
not
my
invention
but
is
reported
in
the
john
blackhawk
manuscript
tobacco
was
that
sacred
to
the
native
americans
of
those
times
another
matter
on
which
historians
disagree
is
the
origin
of
the
expression
which
made
its
appearance
in
the
american
language
in
the
here
i
propose
an
explanation
see
page
that
i
seen
anywhere
else
but
that
like
john
blackhawk
story
makes
sense
to
me
people
at
that
time
attached
the
adjective
old
to
anyone
or
anything
they
felt
affectionate
about
old
glory
old
ironsides
old
hickory
by
the
time
he
got
around
to
running
for
president
zachary
taylor
was
old
rough
and
ready
the
most
popular
alcoholic
beverage
in
early
america
was
whiskey
and
the
best
whiskey
was
distilled
in
kentucky
and
widely
known
as
old
kaintuck
it
was
a
jug
of
old
kaintuck
that
raoul
grudgingly
shared
with
abe
lincoln
it
seems
likely
enough
that
the
nickname
old
kaintuck
would
in
time
be
shortened
to
easier
to
say
