prefatory
note
being
invited
to
lecture
at
the
imperial
university
of
japan
in
tokyo
during
february
and
march
of
the
present
year
i
attempted
an
interpretation
of
the
reconstruction
of
ideas
and
ways
of
thought
now
going
on
in
philosophy
while
the
lectures
can
not
avoid
revealing
the
marks
of
the
particular
standpoint
of
their
author
the
aim
is
to
exhibit
the
general
contrasts
between
older
and
newer
types
of
philosophic
problems
rather
than
to
make
a
partisan
plea
in
behalf
of
any
one
specific
solution
of
these
problems
i
have
tried
for
the
most
part
to
set
forth
the
forces
which
make
intellectual
reconstruction
inevitable
and
to
prefigure
some
of
the
lines
upon
which
it
must
proceed
any
one
who
has
enjoyed
the
unique
hospitality
of
japan
will
be
overwhelmed
with
confusion
if
he
endeavors
to
make
an
acknowledgment
in
any
way
commensurate
to
the
kindnesses
he
received
yet
i
must
set
down
in
the
barest
of
black
and
white
my
grateful
appreciation
of
them
and
in
particular
record
my
ineffaceable
impressions
of
the
courtesy
and
help
of
the
members
of
the
department
of

of
tokyo

some
historical
factors
in
philosophical
reconstruction
francis
bacon
exemplifies
the
newer
spirit
he
conceived
knowledge
as
power
as
dependent
upon
organized
cooperative
research
as
tested
by
promotion
of
social
progress
the
new
thought
reflected
actual
social
changes
industrial
political
religious
the
new
idealism
iii
the
scientific
factor
in
reconstruction
of
philosophy
science
has
revolutionized
our
conception
of
nature
philosophy
has
to
be
transformed
because
no
longer
depending
upon
a
science
which
accepts
a
closed
finite
world
or
fixed
species
or
superiority
or
rest
to
change

motion

of
feudal

i
changing
conceptions
of
philosophy
man
differs
from
the
lower
animals
because
he
preserves
his
past
experiences
what
happened
in
the
past
is
lived
again
in
memory
about
what
goes
on
today
hangs
a
cloud
of
thoughts
concerning
similar
things
undergone
in
bygone
days
with
the
animals
an
experience
perishes
as
it
happens
and
each
new
doing
or
suffering
stands
alone
but
man
lives
in
a
world
where
each
occurrence
is
charged
with
echoes
and
reminiscences
of
what
has
gone
before
where
each
event
is
a
reminder
of
other
things
hence
he
lives
not
like
the
beasts
of
the
field
in
a
world
of
merely
physical
things
but
in
a
world
of
signs
and
symbols
a
stone
is
not
merely
hard
a
thing
into
which
one
bumps
but
it
is
a
monument
of
a
deceased
ancestor
a
flame
is
not
merely
something
which
warms
or
burns
but
is
a
symbol
of
the
enduring
life
of
the
household
of
the
abiding
source
of
cheer
nourishment
and
shelter
to
which
man
returns
from
his
casual
wanderings
instead
of
being
a
quick
fork
of
fire
which
may
sting
and
hurt
it
is
the
hearth
at
which
one
worships
and
for
which
one
fights
and
all
this
which
marks
the
difference
between
bestiality
and
humanity
between
culture
and
merely
physical
nature
is
because
man
remembers
preserving
and
recording
his
experiences
the
revivals
of
memory
are
however
rarely
literal
we
naturally
remember
what
interests
us
and
because
it
interests
us
the
past
is
recalled
not
because
of
itself
but
because
of
what
it
adds
to
the
present
thus
the
primary
life
of
memory
is
emotional
rather
than
intellectual
and
practical
savage
man
recalled
yesterday
struggle
with
an
animal
not
in
order
to
study
in
a
scientific
way
the
qualities
of
the
animal
or
for
the
sake
of
calculating
how
better
to
fight
tomorrow
but
to
escape
from
the
tedium
of
today
by
regaining
the
thrill
of
yesterday
the
memory
has
all
the
excitement
of
the
combat
without
its
danger
and
anxiety
to
revive
it
and
revel
in
it
is
to
enhance
the
present
moment
with
a
new
meaning
a
meaning
different
from
that
which
actually
belongs
either
to
it
or
to
the
past
memory
is
vicarious
experience
in
which
there
is
all
the
emotional
values
of
actual
experience
without
its
strains
vicissitudes
and
troubles
the
triumph
of
battle
is
even
more
poignant
in
the
memorial
war
dance
than
at
the
moment
of
victory
the
conscious
and
truly
human
experience
of
the
chase
comes
when
it
is
talked
over
and
by
the
camp
fire
at
the
time
attention
is
taken
up
with
practical
details
and
with
the
strain
of
uncertainty
only
later
do
the
details
compose
into
a
story
and
fuse
into
a
whole
of
meaning
at
the
time
of
practical
experience
man
exists
from
moment
to
moment
preoccupied
with
the
task
of
the
moment
as
he
all
the
moments
in
thought
a
drama
emerges
with
a
beginning
a
middle
and
a
movement
toward
the
climax
of
achievement
or
defeat
since
man
revives
his
past
experience
because
of
the
interest
added
to
what
would
otherwise
be
the
emptiness
of
present
leisure
the
primitive
life
of
memory
is
one
of
fancy
and
imagination
rather
than
of
accurate
recollection
after
all
it
is
the
story
the
drama
which
counts
only
those
incidents
are
selected
which
have
a
present
emotional
value
to
intensify
the
present
tale
as
it
is
rehearsed
in
imagination
or
told
to
an
admiring
listener
what
does
not
add
to
the
thrill
of
combat
or
contribute
to
the
goal
of
success
or
failure
is
dropped
incidents
are
rearranged
till
they
fit
into
the
temper
of
the
tale
thus
early
man
when
left
to
himself
when
not
actually
engaged
in
the
struggle
for
existence
lived
in
a
world
of
memories
which
was
a
world
of
suggestions
a
suggestion
differs
from
a
recollection
in
that
no
attempt
is
made
to
test
its
correctness
its
correctness
is
a
matter
of
relative
indifference
the
cloud
suggests
a
camel
or
a
man
face
it
could
not
suggest
these
things
unless
some
time
there
had
been
an
actual
literal
experience
of
camel
and
face
but
the
real
likeness
is
of
no
account
the
main
thing
is
the
emotional
interest
in
tracing
the
camel
or
following
the
fortunes
of
the
face
as
it
forms
and
dissolves
students
of
the
primitive
history
of
mankind
tell
of
the
enormous
part
played
by
animal
tales
myths
and
cults
sometimes
a
mystery
is
made
out
of
this
historical
fact
as
if
it
indicated
that
primitive
man
was
moved
by
a
different
psychology
from
that
which
now
animates
humanity
but
the
explanation
is
i
think
simple
until
agriculture
and
the
higher
industrial
arts
were
developed
long
periods
of
empty
leisure
alternated
with
comparatively
short
periods
of
energy
put
forth
to
secure
food
or
safety
from
attack
because
of
our
own
habits
we
tend
to
think
of
people
as
busy
or
occupied
if
not
with
doing
at
least
with
thinking
and
planning
but
then
men
were
busy
only
when
engaged
in
the
hunt
or
fishing
or
fighting
expedition
yet
the
mind
when
awake
must
have
some
filling
it
can
not
remain
literally
vacant
because
the
body
is
idle
and
what
thoughts
should
crowd
into
the
human
mind
except
experiences
with
animals
experiences
transformed
under
the
influence
of
dramatic
interest
to
make
more
vivid
and
coherent
the
events
typical
of
the
chase
as
men
in
fancy
dramatically
the
interesting
parts
of
their
actual
lives
animals
inevitably
became
themselves
dramatized
they
were
true
and
as
such
assumed
the
traits
of
persons
they
too
had
desires
hopes
and
fears
a
life
of
affections
loves
and
hates
triumphs
and
defeats
moreover
since
they
were
essential
to
the
support
of
the
community
their
activities
and
sufferings
made
them
in
the
imagination
which
dramatically
revived
the
past
true
sharers
in
the
life
of
the
community
although
they
were
hunted
yet
they
permitted
themselves
after
all
to
be
caught
and
hence
they
were
friends
and
allies
they
devoted
themselves
quite
literally
to
the
sustenance
and
of
the
community
group
to
which
they
belonged
thus
were
produced
not
merely
the
multitude
of
tales
and
legends
dwelling
affectionately
upon
the
activities
and
features
of
animals
but
also
those
elaborate
rites
and
cults
which
made
animals
ancestors
heroes
tribal
and
divinities
i
hope
that
i
do
not
seem
to
you
to
have
gone
too
far
afield
from
my
topic
the
origin
of
philosophies
for
it
seems
to
me
that
the
historic
source
of
philosophies
can
not
be
understood
except
as
we
dwell
at
even
greater
length
and
in
more
detail
upon
such
considerations
as
these
we
need
to
recognize
that
the
ordinary
consciousness
of
the
ordinary
man
left
to
himself
is
a
creature
of
desires
rather
than
of
intellectual
study
inquiry
or
speculation
man
ceases
to
be
primarily
actuated
by
hopes
and
fears
loves
and
hates
only
when
he
is
subjected
to
a
discipline
which
is
foreign
to
human
nature
which
is
from
the
standpoint
of
natural
man
artificial
naturally
our
books
our
scientific
and
philosophical
books
are
written
by
men
who
have
subjected
themselves
in
a
superior
degree
to
intellectual
discipline
and
culture
their
thoughts
are
habitually
reasonable
they
have
learned
to
check
their
fancies
by
facts
and
to
organize
their
ideas
logically
rather
than
emotionally
and
dramatically
when
they
do
indulge
in
reverie
and
which
is
probably
more
of
the
time
than
is
conventionally
acknowledged
they
are
aware
of
what
they
are
doing
they
label
these
excursions
and
do
not
confuse
their
results
with
objective
experiences
we
tend
to
judge
others
by
ourselves
and
because
scientific
and
philosophic
books
are
composed
by
men
in
whom
the
reasonable
logical
and
objective
habit
of
mind
predominates
a
similar
rationality
has
been
attributed
by
them
to
the
average
and
ordinary
man
it
is
then
overlooked
that
both
rationality
and
irrationality
are
largely
irrelevant
and
episodical
in
undisciplined
human
nature
that
men
are
governed
by
memory
rather
than
by
thought
and
that
memory
is
not
a
remembering
of
actual
facts
but
is
association
suggestion
dramatic
fancy
the
standard
used
to
measure
the
value
of
the
suggestions
that
spring
up
in
the
mind
is
not
congruity
with
fact
but
emotional
congeniality
do
they
stimulate
and
reinforce
feeling
and
fit
into
the
dramatic
tale
are
they
consonant
with
the
prevailing
mood
and
can
they
be
rendered
into
the
traditional
hopes
and
fears
of
the
community
if
we
are
willing
to
take
the
word
dreams
with
a
certain
liberality
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
man
save
in
his
occasional
times
of
actual
work
and
struggle
lives
in
a
world
of
dreams
rather
than
of
facts
and
a
world
of
dreams
that
is
organized
about
desires
whose
success
and
frustration
form
its
stuff
to
treat
the
early
beliefs
and
traditions
of
mankind
as
if
they
were
attempts
at
scientific
explanation
of
the
world
only
erroneous
and
absurd
attempts
is
thus
to
be
guilty
of
a
great
mistake
the
material
out
of
which
philosophy
finally
emerges
is
irrelevant
to
science
and
to
explanation
it
is
figurative
symbolic
of
fears
and
hopes
made
of
imaginations
and
suggestions
not
significant
of
a
world
of
objective
fact
intellectually
confronted
it
is
poetry
and
drama
rather
than
science
and
is
apart
from
scientific
truth
and
falsity
rationality
or
absurdity
of
fact
in
the
same
way
in
which
poetry
is
independent
of
these
things
this
original
material
has
however
to
pass
through
at
least
two
stages
before
it
becomes
philosophy
proper
one
is
the
stage
in
which
stories
and
legends
and
their
accompanying
dramatizations
are
consolidated
at
first
the
emotionalized
records
of
experiences
are
largely
casual
and
transitory
events
that
excite
the
emotions
of
an
individual
are
seized
upon
and
lived
over
in
tale
and
pantomime
but
some
experiences
are
so
frequent
and
recurrent
that
they
concern
the
group
as
a
whole
they
are
socially
generalized
the
piecemeal
adventure
of
the
single
individual
is
built
out
till
it
becomes
representative
and
typical
of
the
emotional
life
of
the
tribe
certain
incidents
affect
the
weal
and
woe
of
the
group
in
its
entirety
and
thereby
get
an
exceptional
emphasis
and
elevation
a
certain
texture
of
tradition
is
built
up
the
story
becomes
a
social
heritage
and
possession
the
pantomime
develops
into
the
stated
rite
tradition
thus
formed
becomes
a
kind
of
norm
to
which
individual
fancy
and
suggestion
conform
an
abiding
framework
of
imagination
is
constructed
a
communal
way
of
conceiving
life
grows
up
into
which
individuals
are
inducted
by
education
both
unconsciously
and
by
definite
social
requirement
individual
memories
are
assimilated
to
group
memory
or
tradition
and
individual
fancies
are
accommodated
to
the
body
of
beliefs
characteristic
of
a
community
poetry
becomes
fixated
and
systematized
the
story
becomes
a
social
norm
the
original
drama
which
an
emotionally
important
experience
is
institutionalized
into
a
cult
suggestions
previously
free
are
hardened
into
doctrines
the
systematic
and
obligatory
nature
of
such
doctrines
is
hastened
and
confirmed
through
conquests
and
political
consolidation
as
the
area
of
a
government
is
extended
there
is
a
definite
motive
for
systematizing
and
unifying
beliefs
once
free
and
floating
aside
from
natural
accommodation
and
assimilation
springing
from
the
fact
of
intercourse
and
the
needs
of
common
understanding
there
is
often
political
necessity
which
leads
the
ruler
to
centralize
traditions
and
beliefs
in
order
to
extend
and
strengthen
his
prestige
and
authority

i
presume
all
other
countries
having
a
long
history
present
records
of
a
continual
working
over
of
earlier
local
rites
and
doctrines
in
the
interests
of
a
wider
social
unity
and
a
more
extensive
political
power
i
shall
ask
you
to
assume
with
me
that
in
this
way
the
larger
cosmogonies
and
cosmologies
of
the
race
as
well
as
the
larger
ethical
traditions
have
arisen
whether
this
is
literally
so
or
not
it
is
not
necessary
to
inquire
much
less
to
demonstrate
it
is
enough
for
our
purposes
that
under
social
influences
there
took
place
a
fixing
and
organizing
of
doctrines
and
cults
which
gave
general
traits
to
the
imagination
and
general
rules
to
conduct
and
that
such
a
consolidation
was
a
necessary
antecedent
to
the
formation
of
any
philosophy
as
we
understand
that
term
although
a
necessary
antecedent
this
organization
and
generalization
of
ideas
and
principles
of
belief
is
not
the
sole
and
sufficient
generator
of
philosophy
there
is
still
lacking
the
motive
for
logical
system
and
intellectual
proof
this
we
may
suppose
to
be
furnished
by
the
need
of
reconciling
the
moral
rules
and
ideals
embodied
in
the
traditional
code
with
the
matter
of
fact
positivistic
knowledge
which
gradually
grows
up
for
man
can
never
be
wholly
the
creature
of
suggestion
and
fancy
the
requirements
of
continued
existence
make
indispensable
some
attention
to
the
actual
facts
of
the
world
although
it
is
surprising
how
little
check
the
environment
actually
puts
upon
the
formation
of
ideas
since
no
notions
are
too
absurd
not
to
have
been
accepted
by
some
people
yet
the
environment
does
enforce
a
certain
minimum
of
correctness
under
penalty
of
extinction
that
certain
things
are
foods
that
they
are
to
be
found
in
certain
places
that
water
drowns
fire
burns
that
sharp
points
penetrate
and
cut
that
heavy
things
fall
unless
supported
that
there
is
a
certain
regularity
in
the
changes
of
day
and
night
and
the
alternation
of
hot
and
cold
wet
and
dry
such
prosaic
facts
force
themselves
upon
even
primitive
attention
some
of
them
are
so
obvious
and
so
important
that
they
have
next
to
no
fanciful
context
auguste
comte
says
somewhere
that
he
knows
of
no
savage
people
who
had
a
god
of
weight
although
every
other
natural
quality
or
force
may
have
been
deified
gradually
there
grows
up
a
body
of
homely
generalizations
preserving
and
transmitting
the
wisdom
of
the
race
about
the
observed
facts
and
sequences
of
nature
this
knowledge
is
especially
connected
with
industries
arts
and
crafts
where
observation
of
materials
and
processes
is
required
for
successful
action
and
where
action
is
so
continuous
and
regular
that
spasmodic
magic
will
not
suffice
extravagantly
fantastic
notions
are
eliminated
because
they
are
brought
into
juxtaposition
with
what
actually
happens
the
sailor
is
more
likely
to
be
given
to
what
we
now
term
superstitions
than
say
the
weaver
because
his
activity
is
more
at
the
mercy
of
sudden
change
and
unforeseen
occurrence
but
even
the
sailor
while
he
may
regard
the
wind
as
the
uncontrollable
expression
of
the
caprice
of
a
great
spirit
will
still
have
to
become
acquainted
with
some
purely
mechanical
principles
of
adjustment
of
boat
sails
and
oar
to
the
wind
fire
may
be
conceived
as
a
supernatural
dragon
because
some
time
or
other
a
swift
bright
and
devouring
flame
called
before
the
mind
eye
the
and
dangerous
serpent
but
the
housewife
who
tends
the
fire
and
the
pots
wherein
food
cooks
will
still
be
compelled
to
observe
certain
mechanical
facts
of
draft
and
replenishment
and
passage
from
wood
to
ash
still
more
will
the
worker
in
metals
accumulate
verifiable
details
about
the
conditions
and
consequences
of
the
operation
of
heat
he
may
retain
for
special
and
ceremonial
occasions
traditional
beliefs
but
everyday
familiar
use
will
expel
these
conceptions
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
when
fire
will
be
to
him
of
uniform
and
prosaic
behavior
controllable
by
practical
relations
of
cause
and
effect
as
the
arts
and
crafts
develop
and
become
more
elaborate
the
body
of
positive
and
tested
knowledge
enlarges
and
the
sequences
observed
become
more
complex
and
of
greater
scope
technologies
of
this
kind
give
that
knowledge
of
nature
out
of
which
science
takes
its
origin
they
provide
not
merely
a
collection
of
positive
facts
but
they
give
expertness
in
dealing
with
materials
and
tools
and
promote
the
development
of
the
experimental
habit
of
mind
as
soon
as
an
art
can
be
taken
away
from
the
rule
of
sheer
custom
for
a
long
time
the
imaginative
body
of
beliefs
closely
connected
with
the
moral
habits
of
a
community
group
and
with
its
emotional
indulgences
and
consolations
persists
side
by
side
with
the
growing
body
of
matter
of
fact
knowledge
wherever
possible
they
are
interlaced
at
other
points
their
inconsistencies
forbid
their
interweaving
but
the
two
things
are
kept
apart
as
if
in
different
compartments
since
one
is
merely
upon
the
other
their
incompatibility
is
not
felt
and
there
is
no
need
of
reconciliation
in
most
cases
the
two
kinds
of
mental
products
are
kept
apart
because
they
become
the
possession
of
separate
social
classes
the
religious
and
poetic
beliefs
having
acquired
a
definite
social
and
political
value
and
function
are
in
the
keeping
of
a
higher
class
directly
associated
with
the
ruling
elements
in
the
society
the
workers
and
craftsmen
who
possess
the
prosaic
matter
of
fact
knowledge
are
likely
to
occupy
a
low
social
status
and
their
kind
of
knowledge
is
affected
by
the
social
disesteem
entertained
for
the
manual
worker
who
engages
in
activities
useful
to
the
body
it
doubtless
was
this
fact
in
greece
which
in
spite
of
the
keenness
of
observation
the
extraordinary
power
of
logical
reasoning
and
the
great
freedom
of
speculation
attained
by
the
athenian
postponed
the
general
and
systematic
employment
of
the
experimental
method
since
the
industrial
craftsman
was
only
just
above
the
slave
in
social
rank
his
type
of
knowledge
and
the
method
upon
which
it
depended
lacked
prestige
and
authority
nevertheless
the
time
came
when
matter
of
fact
knowledge
increased
to
such
bulk
and
scope
that
it
came
into
conflict
with
not
merely
the
detail
but
with
the
spirit
and
temper
of
traditional
and
imaginative
beliefs
without
going
into
the
vexed
question
of
how
and
why
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
just
what
happened
in
what
we
term
the
sophistic
movement
in
greece
within
which
originated
philosophy
proper
in
the
sense
in
which
the
western
world
understands
that
term
the
fact
that
the
sophists
had
a
bad
name
given
them
by
plato
and
aristotle
a
name
they
have
never
been
able
to
shake
off
is
evidence
that
with
the
sophists
the
strife
between
the
two
types
of
belief
was
the
emphatic
thing
and
that
the
conflict
had
a
disconcerting
effect
upon
the
traditional
system
of
religious
beliefs
and
the
moral
code
of
conduct
bound
up
with
it
although
socrates
was
doubtless
sincerely
interested
in
the
reconciliation
of
the
two
sides
yet
the
fact
that
he
approached
the
matter
from
the
side
of
matter
of
fact
method
giving
its
canons
and
criteria
primacy
was
enough
to
bring
him
to
the
condemnation
of
death
as
a
contemner
of
the
gods
and
a
corrupter
of
youth
the
fate
of
socrates
and
the
of
the
sophists
may
be
used
to
suggest
some
of
the
striking
contrasts
between
traditional
emotionalized
belief
on
one
hand
and
prosaic
matter
of
fact
knowledge
on
the
other
the
purpose
of
the
comparison
being
to
bring
out
the
point
that
while
all
the
advantages
of
what
we
call
science
were
on
the
side
of
the
latter
the
advantages
of
social
esteem
and
authority
and
of
intimate
contact
with
what
gives
life
its
deeper
lying
values
were
on
the
side
of
traditional
belief
to
all
appearances
the
specific
and
verified
knowledge
of
the
environment
had
only
a
limited
and
technical
scope
it
had
to
do
with
the
arts
and
the
purpose
and
good
of
the
artisan
after
all
did
not
extend
very
far
they
were
subordinate
and
almost
servile
who
would
put
the
art
of
the
shoemaker
on
the
same
plane
as
the
art
of
ruling
the
state
who
would
put
even
the
higher
art
of
the
physician
in
healing
the
body
upon
the
level
of
the
art
of
the
priest
in
healing
the
soul
thus
plato
constantly
draws
the
contrast
in
his
dialogues
the
shoemaker
is
a
judge
of
a
good
pair
of
shoes
but
he
is
no
judge
at
all
of
the
more
important
question
whether
and
when
it
is
good
to
wear
shoes
the
physician
is
a
good
judge
of
health
but
whether
it
is
a
good
thing
or
not
to
be
well
or
better
to
die
he
knows
not
while
the
artisan
is
expert
as
long
as
purely
limited
technical
questions
arise
he
is
helpless
when
it
comes
to
the
only
really
important
questions
the
moral
questions
as
to
values
consequently
his
type
of
knowledge
is
inherently
inferior
and
needs
to
be
controlled
by
a
higher
kind
of
knowledge
which
will
reveal
ultimate
ends
and
purposes
and
thus
put
and
keep
technical
and
mechanical
knowledge
in
its
proper
place
moreover
in
plato
pages
we
find
because
of
plato
adequate
dramatic
sense
a
lively
depicting
of
the
impact
in
particular
men
of
the
conflict
between
tradition
and
the
new
claims
of
purely
intellectual
knowledge
the
conservative
is
shocked
beyond
measure
at
the
idea
of
teaching
the
military
art
by
abstract
rules
by
science
one
does
not
just
fight
one
fights
for
one
country
abstract
science
can
not
convey
love
and
loyalty
nor
can
it
be
a
substitute
even
upon
the
more
technical
side
for
those
ways
and
means
of
fighting
in
which
devotion
to
the
country
has
been
traditionally
embodied
the
way
to
learn
the
fighting
art
is
through
association
with
those
who
have
themselves
learned
to
defend
the
country
by
becoming
saturated
with
its
ideals
and
customs
by
becoming
in
short
a
practical
adept
in
the
greek
tradition
as
to
fighting
to
attempt
to
derive
abstract
rules
from
a
comparison
of
native
ways
of
fighting
with
the
enemies
ways
is
to
begin
to
go
over
to
the
enemies
traditions
and
gods
it
is
to
begin
to
be
false
to
one
own
country
such
a
point
of
view
vividly
realized
enables
us
to
appreciate
the
antagonism
aroused
by
the
positivistic
point
of
view
when
it
came
into
conflict
with
the
traditional
the
latter
was
deeply
rooted
in
social
habits
and
loyalties
it
was
surcharged
with
the
moral
aims
for
which
men
lived
and
the
moral
rules
by
which
they
lived
hence
it
was
as
basic
and
as
comprehensive
as
life
itself
and
palpitated
with
the
warm
glowing
colors
of
the
community
life
in
which
men
realized
their
own
being
in
contrast
the
positivistic
knowledge
was
concerned
with
merely
physical
utilities
and
lacked
the
ardent
associations
of
belief
hallowed
by
sacrifices
of
ancestors
and
worship
of
contemporaries
because
of
its
limited
and
concrete
character
it
was
dry
hard
cold
yet
the
more
acute
and
active
minds
like
that
of
plato
himself
could
no
longer
be
content
to
accept
along
with
the
conservative
citizen
of
the
time
the
old
beliefs
in
the
old
way
the
growth
of
positive
knowledge
and
of
the
critical
inquiring
spirit
undermined
these
in
their
old
form
the
advantages
in
definiteness
in
accuracy
in
verifiability
were
all
on
the
side
of
the
new
knowledge
tradition
was
noble
in
aim
and
scope
but
uncertain
in
foundation
the
unquestioned
life
said
socrates
was
not
one
fit
to
be
lived
by
man
who
is
a
questioning
being
because
he
is
a
rational
being
hence
he
must
search
out
the
reason
of
things
and
not
accept
them
from
custom
and
political
authority
what
was
to
be
done
develop
a
method
of
rational
investigation
and
proof
which
should
place
the
essential
elements
of
traditional
belief
upon
an
unshakable
basis
develop
a
method
of
thought
and
knowledge
which
while
purifying
tradition
should
preserve
its
moral
and
social
values
unimpaired
nay
by
purifying
them
add
to
their
power
and
authority
to
put
it
in
a
word
that
which
had
rested
upon
custom
was
to
be
restored
resting
no
longer
upon
the
habits
of
the
past
but
upon
the
very
metaphysics
of
being
and
the
universe
metaphysics
is
a
substitute
for
custom
as
the
source
and
guarantor
of
higher
moral
and
social
values
that
is
the
leading
theme
of
the
classic
philosophy
of
europe
as
evolved
by
plato
and
aristotle
a
philosophy
let
us
always
recall
renewed
and
restated
by
the
christian
philosophy
of
medieval
europe
out
of
this
situation
emerged
if
i
mistake
not
the
entire
tradition
regarding
the
function
and
office
of
philosophy
which
till
very
recently
has
controlled
the
systematic
and
constructive
philosophies
of
the
western
world
if
i
am
right
in
my
main
thesis
that
the
origin
of
philosophy
lay
in
an
attempt
to
reconcile
the
two
different
types
of
mental
product
then
the
key
is
in
our
hands
as
to
the
main
traits
of
subsequent
philosophy
so
far
as
that
was
not
of
a
negative
and
heterodox
kind
in
the
first
place
philosophy
did
not
develop
in
an
unbiased
way
from
an
open
and
unprejudiced
origin
it
had
its
task
cut
out
for
it
from
the
start
it
had
a
mission
to
perform
and
it
was
sworn
in
advance
to
that
mission
it
had
to
extract
the
essential
moral
kernel
out
of
the
threatened
traditional
beliefs
of
the
past
so
far
so
good
the
work
was
critical
and
in
the
interests
of
the
only
true
conservatism
that
which
will
conserve
and
not
waste
the
values
wrought
out
by
humanity
but
it
was
also
precommitted
to
extracting
this
moral
essence
in
a
spirit
congenial
to
the
spirit
of
past
beliefs
the
association
with
imagination
and
with
social
authority
was
too
intimate
to
be
deeply
disturbed
it
was
not
possible
to
conceive
of
the
content
of
social
institutions
in
any
form
radically
different
from
that
in
which
they
had
existed
in
the
past
it
became
the
work
of
philosophy
to
justify
on
rational
grounds
the
spirit
though
not
the
form
of
accepted
beliefs
and
traditional
customs
the
resulting
philosophy
seemed
radical
enough
and
even
dangerous
to
the
average
athenian
because
of
the
difference
of
form
and
method
in
the
sense
of
pruning
away
excrescences
and
eliminating
factors
which
to
the
average
citizen
were
all
one
with
the
basic
beliefs
it
was
radical
but
looked
at
in
the
perspective
of
history
and
in
contrast
with
different
types
of
thought
which
developed
later
in
different
social
environments
it
is
now
easy
to
see
how
profoundly
after
all
plato
and
aristotle
reflected
the
meaning
of
greek
tradition
and
habit
so
that
their
writings
remain
with
the
writings
of
the
great
dramatists
the
best
introduction
of
a
student
into
the
innermost
ideals
and
aspirations
of
distinctively
greek
life
without
greek
religion
greek
art
greek
civic
life
their
philosophy
would
have
been
impossible
while
the
effect
of
that
science
upon
which
the
philosophers
most
prided
themselves
turns
out
to
have
been
superficial
and
negligible
this
apologetic
spirit
of
philosophy
is
even
more
apparent
when
medieval
christianity
about
the
twelfth
century
sought
for
a
systematic
rational
presentation
of
itself
and
made
use
of
classic
philosophy
especially
that
of
aristotle
to
justify
itself
to
reason
a
not
unsimilar
occurrence
characterizes
the
chief
philosophic
systems
of
germany
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
when
hegel
assumed
the
task
of
justifying
in
the
name
of
rational
idealism
the
doctrines
and
institutions
which
were
menaced
by
the
new
spirit
of
science
and
popular
government
the
result
has
been
that
the
great
systems
have
not
been
free
from
party
spirit
exercised
in
behalf
of
preconceived
beliefs
since
they
have
at
the
same
time
professed
complete
intellectual
independence
and
rationality
the
result
has
been
too
often
to
impart
to
philosophy
an
element
of
insincerity
all
the
more
insidious
because
wholly
unconscious
on
the
part
of
those
who
sustained
philosophy
and
this
brings
us
to
a
second
trait
of
philosophy
springing
from
its
origin
since
it
aimed
at
a
rational
justification
of
things
that
had
been
previously
accepted
because
of
their
emotional
congeniality
and
social
prestige
it
had
to
make
much
of
the
apparatus
of
reason
and
proof
because
of
the
lack
of
intrinsic
rationality
in
the
matters
with
which
it
dealt
it
leaned
over
backward
so
to
speak
in
parade
of
logical
form
in
dealing
with
matters
of
fact
simpler
and
rougher
ways
of
demonstration
may
be
resorted
to
it
is
enough
so
to
say
to
produce
the
fact
in
question
and
point
to
it
the
fundamental
form
of
all
demonstration
but
when
it
comes
to
convincing
men
of
the
truth
of
doctrines
which
are
no
longer
to
be
accepted
upon
the
of
custom
and
social
authority
but
which
also
are
not
capable
of
empirical
verification
there
is
no
recourse
save
to
magnify
the
signs
of
rigorous
thought
and
rigid
demonstration
thus
arises
that
appearance
of
abstract
definition
and
argumentation
which
repels
so
many
from
philosophy
but
which
has
been
one
of
its
chief
attractions
to
its
devotees
at
the
worst
this
has
reduced
philosophy
to
a
show
of
elaborate
terminology
a
logic
and
a
fictitious
devotion
to
the
mere
external
forms
of
comprehensive
and
minute
demonstration
even
at
the
best
it
has
tended
to
produce
an
overdeveloped
attachment
to
system
for
its
own
sake
and
an
claim
to
certainty
bishop
butler
declared
that
probability
is
the
guide
of
life
but
few
philosophers
have
been
courageous
enough
to
avow
that
philosophy
can
be
satisfied
with
anything
that
is
merely
probable
the
customs
dictated
by
tradition
and
desire
had
claimed
finality
and
immutability
they
had
claimed
to
give
certain
and
unvarying
laws
of
conduct
very
early
in
its
history
philosophy
made
pretension
to
a
similar
conclusiveness
and
something
of
this
temper
has
clung
to
classic
philosophies
ever
since
they
have
insisted
that
they
were
more
scientific
than
the
sciences
that
indeed
philosophy
was
necessary
because
after
all
the
special
sciences
fail
in
attaining
final
and
complete
truth
there
have
been
a
few
dissenters
who
have
ventured
to
assert
as
did
william
james
that
philosophy
is
vision
and
that
its
chief
function
is
to
free
minds
from
bias
and
prejudice
and
to
enlarge
their
perceptions
of
the
world
about
them
but
in
the
main
philosophy
has
set
up
much
more
ambitious
pretensions
to
say
frankly
that
philosophy
can
proffer
nothing
but
hypotheses
and
that
these
hypotheses
are
of
value
only
as
they
render
men
minds
more
sensitive
to
life
about
them
would
seem
like
a
negation
of
philosophy
itself
in
the
third
place
the
body
of
beliefs
dictated
by
desire
and
imagination
and
developed
under
the
influence
of
communal
authority
into
an
authoritative
tradition
was
pervasive
and
comprehensive
it
was
so
to
speak
omnipresent
in
all
the
details
of
the
group
life
its
pressure
was
unremitting
and
its
influence
universal
it
was
then
probably
inevitable
that
the
rival
principle
reflective
thought
should
aim
at
a
similar
universality
and
comprehensiveness
it
would
be
as
inclusive
and
metaphysically
as
tradition
had
been
socially
now
there
was
just
one
way
in
which
this
pretension
could
be
accomplished
in
conjunction
with
a
claim
of
complete
logical
system
and
certainty
all
philosophies
of
the
classic
type
have
made
a
fixed
and
fundamental
distinction
between
two
realms
of
existence
one
of
these
corresponds
to
the
religious
and
supernatural
world
of
popular
tradition
which
in
its
metaphysical
rendering
became
the
world
of
highest
and
ultimate
reality
since
the
final
source
and
sanction
of
all
important
truths
and
rules
of
conduct
in
community
life
had
been
found
in
superior
and
unquestioned
religious
beliefs
so
the
absolute
and
supreme
reality
of
philosophy
afforded
the
only
sure
guaranty
of
truth
about
empirical
matters
and
the
sole
rational
guide
to
proper
social
institutions
and
individual
behavior
over
against
this
absolute
and
noumenal
reality
which
could
be
apprehended
only
by
the
systematic
discipline
of
philosophy
itself
stood
the
ordinary
empirical
relatively
real
phenomenal
world
of
everyday
experience
it
was
with
this
world
that
the
practical
affairs
and
utilities
of
men
were
connected
it
was
to
this
imperfect
and
perishing
world
that
matter
of
fact
positivistic
science
referred
this
is
the
trait
which
in
my
opinion
has
affected
most
deeply
the
classic
notion
about
the
nature
of
philosophy
philosophy
has
arrogated
to
itself
the
office
of
demonstrating
the
existence
of
a
transcendent
absolute
or
inner
reality
and
of
revealing
to
man
the
nature
and
features
of
this
ultimate
and
higher
reality
it
has
therefore
claimed
that
it
was
in
possession
of
a
higher
organ
of
knowledge
than
is
employed
by
positive
science
and
ordinary
practical
experience
and
that
it
is
marked
by
a
superior
dignity
and
importance
a
claim
which
is
undeniable
philosophy
leads
man
to
proof
and
intuition
of
a
reality
beyond
that
open
to
life
and
the
special
sciences
this
claim
has
of
course
been
denied
by
various
philosophers
from
time
to
time
but
for
the
most
part
these
denials
have
been
agnostic
and
sceptical
they
have
contented
themselves
with
asserting
that
absolute
and
ultimate
reality
is
beyond
human
ken
but
they
have
not
ventured
to
deny
that
such
reality
would
be
the
appropriate
sphere
for
the
exercise
of
philosophic
knowledge
provided
only
it
were
within
the
reach
of
human
intelligence
only
comparatively
recently
has
another
conception
of
the
proper
office
of
philosophy
arisen
this
course
of
lectures
will
be
devoted
to
setting
forth
this
different
conception
of
philosophy
in
some
of
its
main
contrasts
to
what
this
lecture
has
termed
the
classic
conception
at
this
point
it
can
be
referred
to
only
by
anticipation
and
in
cursory
fashion
it
is
implied
in
the
account
which
has
been
given
of
the
origin
of
philosophy
out
of
the
background
of
an
authoritative
tradition
a
tradition
originally
dictated
by
imagination
working
under
the
influence
of
love
and
hate
and
in
the
interest
of
emotional
excitement
and
satisfaction
common
frankness
requires
that
it
be
stated
that
this
account
of
the
origin
of
philosophies
claiming
to
deal
with
absolute
being
in
a
systematic
way
has
been
given
with
malice
prepense
it
seems
to
me
that
this
genetic
method
of
approach
is
a
more
effective
way
of
undermining
this
type
of
philosophic
theorizing
than
any
attempt
at
logical
refutation
could
be
if
this
lecture
succeeds
in
leaving
in
your
minds
as
a
reasonable
hypothesis
the
idea
that
philosophy
originated
not
out
of
intellectual
material
but
out
of
social
and
emotional
material
it
will
also
succeed
in
leaving
with
you
a
changed
attitude
toward
traditional
philosophies
they
will
be
viewed
from
a
new
angle
and
placed
in
a
new
light
new
questions
about
them
will
be
aroused
and
new
standards
for
judging
them
will
be
suggested
if
any
one
will
commence
without
mental
reservations
to
study
the
history
of
philosophy
not
as
an
isolated
thing
but
as
a
chapter
in
the
development
of
civilization
and
culture
if
one
will
connect
the
story
of
philosophy
with
a
study
of
anthropology
primitive
life
the
history
of
religion
literature
and
social
institutions
it
is
confidently
asserted
that
he
will
reach
his
own
independent
judgment
as
to
the
worth
of
the
account
which
has
been
presented
today
considered
in
this
way
the
history
of
philosophy
will
take
on
a
new
significance
what
is
lost
from
the
standpoint
of
science
is
regained
from
the
standpoint
of
humanity
instead
of
the
disputes
of
rivals
about
the
nature
of
reality
we
have
the
scene
of
human
clash
of
social
purpose
and
aspirations
instead
of
impossible
attempts
to
transcend
experience
we
have
the
significant
record
of
the
efforts
of
men
to
formulate
the
things
of
experience
to
which
they
are
most
deeply
and
passionately
attached
instead
of
impersonal
and
purely
speculative
endeavors
to
contemplate
as
remote
beholders
the
nature
of
absolute
we
have
a
living
picture
of
the
choice
of
thoughtful
men
about
what
they
would
have
life
to
be
and
to
what
ends
they
would
have
men
shape
their
intelligent
activities
any
one
of
you
who
arrives
at
such
a
view
of
past
philosophy
will
of
necessity
be
led
to
entertain
a
quite
definite
conception
of
the
scope
and
aim
of
future
philosophizing
he
will
inevitably
be
committed
to
the
notion
that
what
philosophy
has
been
unconsciously
without
knowing
or
intending
it
and
so
to
speak
under
cover
it
must
henceforth
be
openly
and
deliberately
when
it
is
acknowledged
that
under
disguise
of
dealing
with
ultimate
reality
philosophy
has
been
occupied
with
the
precious
values
embedded
in
social
traditions
that
it
has
sprung
from
a
clash
of
social
ends
and
from
a
conflict
of
inherited
institutions
with
incompatible
contemporary
tendencies
it
will
be
seen
that
the
task
of
future
philosophy
is
to
clarify
men
ideas
as
to
the
social
and
moral
strifes
of
their
own
day
its
aim
is
to
become
so
far
as
is
humanly
possible
an
organ
for
dealing
with
these
conflicts
that
which
may
be
pretentiously
unreal
when
it
is
formulated
in
metaphysical
distinctions
becomes
intensely
significant
when
connected
with
the
drama
of
the
struggle
of
social
beliefs
and
ideals
philosophy
which
surrenders
its
somewhat
barren
monopoly
of
dealings
with
ultimate
and
absolute
reality
will
find
a
compensation
in
enlightening
the
moral
forces
which
move
mankind
and
in
contributing
to
the
aspirations
of
men
to
attain
to
a
more
ordered
and
intelligent
happiness
chapter
ii
some
historical
factors
in
philosophical
reconstruction
francis
bacon
of
the
elizabethan
age
is
the
great
forerunner
of
the
spirit
of
modern
life
though
slight
in
accomplishment
as
a
prophet
of
new
tendencies
he
is
an
outstanding
figure
of
the
world
intellectual
life
like
many
another
prophet
he
suffers
from
confused
intermingling
of
old
and
new
what
is
most
significant
in
him
has
been
rendered
more
or
less
familiar
by
the
later
course
of
events
but
page
after
page
is
filled
with
matter
which
belongs
to
the
past
from
which
bacon
thought
he
had
escaped
caught
between
these
two
sources
of
easy
disparagement
bacon
hardly
receives
his
due
as
the
real
founder
of
modern
thought
while
he
is
praised
for
merits
which
scarcely
belong
to
him
such
as
an
alleged
authorship
of
the
specific
methods
of
induction
pursued
by
science
what
makes
bacon
memorable
is
that
breezes
blowing
from
a
new
world
caught
and
filled
his
sails
and
stirred
him
to
adventure
in
new
seas
he
never
himself
discovered
the
land
of
promise
but
he
proclaimed
the
new
goal
and
by
faith
he
descried
its
features
from
afar
the
main
traits
of
his
thought
put
before
our
mind
the
larger
features
of
a
new
spirit
which
was
at
work
in
causing
intellectual
reconstruction
they
may
suggest
the
social
and
historical
forces
out
of
which
the
new
spirit
was
born
the
best
known
aphorism
of
bacon
is
that
knowledge
is
power
judged
by
this
pragmatic
criterion
he
condemned
the
great
body
of
learning
then
extant
as
as
and
for
it
did
not
give
power
it
was
otiose
not
operative
in
his
most
extensive
discussion
he
classified
the
learning
of
his
day
under
three
heads
delicate
fantastic
and
contentious
under
delicate
learning
he
included
the
literary
learning
which
through
the
influence
of
the
revival
of
ancient
languages
and
literatures
occupied
so
important
a
place
in
the
intellectual
life
of
the
renaissance
bacon
condemnation
is
the
more
effective
because
he
himself
was
a
master
of
the
classics
and
of
all
the
graces
and
refinements
which
this
literary
study
was
intended
to
convey
in
substance
he
anticipated
most
of
the
attacks
which
educational
reformers
since
his
time
have
made
upon
literary
culture
it
contributed
not
to
power
but
to
ornament
and
decoration
it
was
ostentatious
and
luxurious
by
fantastic
learning
he
meant
the
science
that
was
so
rife
all
over
europe
in
the
sixteenth
century
wild
developments
of
alchemy
astrology
etc
upon
this
he
poured
his
greatest
vials
of
wrath
because
the
corruption
of
the
good
is
the
worst
of
evils
delicate
learning
was
idle
and
vain
but
fantastic
learning
aped
the
form
of
true
knowledge
it
laid
hold
of
the
true
principle
and
aim
of
knowledge
control
of
natural
forces
but
it
neglected
the
conditions
and
methods
by
which
alone
such
knowledge
could
be
obtained
and
thus
deliberately
led
men
astray
for
our
purposes
however
what
he
says
about
contentious
learning
is
the
most
important
for
by
this
he
means
the
traditional
science
which
had
come
down
in
scanty
and
distorted
measure
to
be
sure
from
antiquity
through
scholasticism
it
is
called
contentious
both
because
of
the
logical
method
used
and
the
end
to
which
it
was
put
in
a
certain
sense
it
aimed
at
power
but
power
over
other
men
in
the
interest
of
some
class
or
sect
or
person
not
power
over
natural
forces
in
the
common
interest
of
all
bacon
conviction
of
the
quarrelsome
character
of
the
scholarship
which
had
come
down
from
antiquity
was
of
course
not
so
much
due
to
greek
science
itself
as
to
the
degenerate
heritage
of
scholasticism
in
the
fourteenth
century
when
philosophy
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
disputatious
theologians
full
of
argumentativeness
and
quirks
and
tricks
by
which
to
win
victory
over
somebody
else
but
bacon
also
brought
his
charge
against
the
aristotelian
method
itself
in
its
rigorous
forms
it
aimed
at
demonstration
and
in
its
milder
forms
at
persuasion
but
both
demonstration
and
persuasion
aim
at
conquest
of
mind
rather
than
of
nature
moreover
they
both
assume
that
some
one
is
already
in
possession
of
a
truth
or
a
belief
and
that
the
only
problem
is
to
convince
some
one
else
or
to
teach
in
contrast
his
new
method
had
an
exceedingly
slight
opinion
of
the
amount
of
truth
already
existent
and
a
lively
sense
of
the
extent
and
importance
of
truths
still
to
be
attained
it
would
be
a
logic
of
discovery
not
a
logic
of
argumentation
proof
and
persuasion
to
bacon
the
old
logic
even
at
its
best
was
a
logic
for
teaching
the
already
known
and
teaching
meant
indoctrination
discipling
it
was
an
axiom
of
aristotle
that
only
that
which
was
already
known
could
be
learned
that
growth
in
knowledge
consisted
simply
in
bringing
together
a
universal
truth
of
reason
and
a
particular
truth
of
sense
which
had
previously
been
noted
separately
in
any
case
learning
meant
of
knowledge
and
growth
belongs
in
the
region
of
becoming
change
and
hence
is
inferior
to
of
knowledge
in
the
syllogistic
manipulation
of
what
was
already
known
demonstration
in
contrast
with
this
point
of
view
bacon
eloquently
proclaimed
the
superiority
of
discovery
of
new
facts
and
truths
to
demonstration
of
the
old
now
there
is
only
one
road
to
discovery
and
that
is
penetrating
inquiry
into
the
secrets
of
nature
scientific
principles
and
laws
do
not
lie
on
the
surface
of
nature
they
are
hidden
and
must
be
wrested
from
nature
by
an
active
and
elaborate
technique
of
inquiry
neither
logical
reasoning
nor
the
passive
accumulation
of
any
number
of
observations
which
the
ancients
called
experience
suffices
to
lay
hold
of
them
active
experimentation
must
force
the
apparent
facts
of
nature
into
forms
different
to
those
in
which
they
familiarly
present
themselves
and
thus
make
them
tell
the
truth
about
themselves
as
torture
may
compel
an
unwilling
witness
to
reveal
what
he
has
been
concealing
pure
reasoning
as
a
means
of
arriving
at
truth
is
like
the
spider
who
spins
a
web
out
of
himself
the
web
is
orderly
and
elaborate
but
it
is
only
a
trap
the
passive
accumulation
of
experiences
the
traditional
empirical
method
is
like
the
ant
who
busily
runs
about
and
collects
and
piles
up
heaps
of
raw
materials
true
method
that
which
bacon
would
usher
in
is
comparable
to
the
operations
of
the
bee
who
like
the
ant
collects
material
from
the
external
world
but
unlike
that
industrious
creature
attacks
and
modifies
the
collected
stuff
in
order
to
make
it
yield
its
hidden
treasure
along
with
this
contrast
between
subjugation
of
nature
and
subjection
of
other
minds
and
the
elevation
of
a
method
of
discovery
above
a
method
of
demonstration
went
bacon
sense
of
progress
as
the
aim
and
test
of
genuine
knowledge
according
to
his
criticisms
the
classic
logic
even
in
its
aristotelian
form
inevitably
played
into
the
hands
of
inert
conservatism
for
in
accustoming
the
mind
to
think
of
truth
as
already
known
it
habituated
men
to
fall
back
on
the
intellectual
attainments
of
the
past
and
to
accept
them
without
critical
scrutiny
not
merely
the
medieval
but
the
renaissance

tended
to
look
back
to
antiquity
as
a
golden
age
of
knowledge
the
former
relying
upon
sacred
scriptures
the
latter
upon
secular
literatures
and
while
this
attitude
could
not
fairly
be
charged
up
against
the
classic
logic
yet
bacon
felt
and
with
justice
that
any
logic
which
identified
the
technique
of
knowing
with
demonstration
of
truths
already
possessed
by
the
mind
blunts
the
spirit
of
investigation
and
confines
the
mind
within
the
circle
of
traditional
learning
such
a
logic
could
not
avoid
having
for
its
salient
features
definition
of
what
is
already
known
or
thought
to
be
known
and
its
systematization
according
to
recognized
canons
of
orthodoxy
a
logic
of
discovery
on
the
other
hand
looks
to
the
future
received
truth
it
regards
critically
as
something
to
be
tested
by
new
experiences
rather
than
as
something
to
be
dogmatically
taught
and
obediently
received
its
chief
interest
in
even
the
most
carefully
tested
knowledge
is
the
use
which
may
be
made
of
it
in
further
inquiries
and
discoveries
old
truth
has
its
chief
value
in
assisting
the
detection
of
new
truth
bacon
own
appreciation
of
the
nature
of
induction
was
highly
defective
but
his
acute
sense
that
science
means
invasion
of
the
unknown
rather
than
repetition
in
logical
form
of
the
already
known
makes
him
nevertheless
the
father
of
induction
endless
and
persistent
uncovering
of
facts
and
principles
not
known
such
is
the
true
spirit
of
induction
continued
progress
in
knowledge
is
the
only
sure
way
of
protecting
old
knowledge
from
degeneration
into
dogmatic
doctrines
received
on
authority
or
from
imperceptible
decay
into
superstition
and
old
wives
tales
progress
is
to
bacon
the
test
as
well
as
the
aim
of
genuine
logic
where
bacon
constantly
demands
where
are
the
works
the
fruits
of
the
older
logic
what
has
it
done
to
ameliorate
the
evils
of
life
to
rectify
defects
to
improve
conditions
where
are
the
inventions
that
justify
its
claim
to
be
in
possession
of
truth
beyond
the
victory
of
man
over
man
in
law
courts
diplomacy
and
political
administration
they
are
nil
one
had
to
turn
from
admired
sciences
to
despised
arts
to
find
works
fruits
consequences
of
value
to
human
kind
through
power
over
natural
forces
and
progress
in
the
arts
was
as
yet
intermittent
fitful
accidental
a
true
logic
or
technique
of
inquiry
would
make
advance
in
the
industrial
agricultural
and
medical
arts
continuous
cumulative
and
deliberately
systematic
if
we
take
into
account
the
supposed
body
of
knowledge
upon
which
learned
men
rested
in
supine
acquiescence
and
which
they
recited
in
chorus
we
find
it
consists
of
two
parts
one
of
these
parts
is
made
up
of
the
errors
of
our
ancestors
musty
with
antiquity
and
organized
into
through
the
use
of
the
classic
logic
such
truths
are
in
fact
only
the
systematized
mistakes
and
prejudices
of
our
ancestors
many
of
them
originated
in
accident
many
in
class
interest
and
bias
perpetuated
by
authority
for
this
very
reason
a
consideration
which
later
actuated
locke
attack
upon
the
doctrine
of
innate
ideas
the
other
portion
of
accepted
beliefs
comes
from
instinctive
tendencies
of
the
human
mind
that
give
it
a
dangerous
bias
until
counteracted
by
a
conscious
and
critical
logic
the
mind
of
man
spontaneously
assumes
greater
simplicity
uniformity
and
unity
among
phenomena
than
actually
exists
it
follows
superficial
analogies
and
jumps
to
conclusions
it
overlooks
the
variety
of
details
and
the
existence
of
exceptions
thus
it
weaves
a
web
of
purely
internal
origin
which
it
imposes
upon
nature
what
had
been
termed
science
in
the
past
consisted
of
this
humanly
constructed
and
imposed
web
men
looked
at
the
work
of
their
own
minds
and
thought
they
were
seeing
realities
in
nature
they
were
worshipping
under
the
name
of
science
the
idols
of
their
own
making
science
and
philosophy
consisted
of
these
anticipations
of
nature
and
the
worst
thing
that
could
be
said
about
traditional
logic
was
that
instead
of
saving
man
from
this
natural
source
of
error
it
had
though
attributing
to
nature
a
false
rationality
of
unity
simplicity
and
generality
sanctioned
these
sources
of
delusion
the
office
of
the
new
logic
would
be
to
protect
the
mind
against
itself
to
teach
it
to
undergo
a
patient
and
prolonged
apprenticeship
to
fact
in
its
infinite
variety
and
particularity
to
obey
nature
intellectually
in
order
to
command
it
practically
such
was
the
significance
of
the
new
logic
the
new
tool
or
organon
of
learning
so
named
in
express
opposition
to
the
organon
of
aristotle
certain
other
important
oppositions
are
implied
aristotle
thought
of
reason
as
capable
of
solitary
communion
with
rational
truth
the
counterpart
of
his
celebrated
saying
that
man
is
a
political
animal
is
that
intelligence
is
neither
animal
human
nor
political
it
is
divinely
unique
and
to
bacon
error
had
been
produced
and
perpetuated
by
social
influences
and
truth
must
be
discovered
by
social
agencies
organized
for
that
purpose
left
to
himself
the
individual
can
do
little
or
nothing
he
is
likely
to
become
involved
in
his
own
web
of
misconceptions
the
great
need
is
the
organization
of
research
whereby
men
attack
nature
collectively
and
the
work
of
inquiry
is
carried
on
continuously
from
generation
to
generation
bacon
even
aspired
to
the
rather
absurd
notion
of
a
method
so
perfected
that
differences
in
natural
human
ability
might
be
discounted
and
all
be
put
on
the
same
level
in
production
of
new
facts
and
new
truths
yet
this
absurdity
was
only
the
negative
side
of
his
great
positive
prophecy
of
a
combined
and
pursuit
of
science
such
as
characterizes
our
own
day
in
view
of
the
picture
he
draws
in
his
new
atlantis
of
a
state
organized
for
collective
inquiry
we
readily
forgive
him
his
exaggerations
power
over
nature
was
not
to
be
individual
but
collective
the
empire
as
he
says
of
man
over
nature
substituted
for
the
empire
of
man
over
man
let
us
employ
bacon
own
words
with
their
variety
of
picturesque
metaphor
men
have
entered
into
the
desire
of
learning
and
knowledge
seldom
sincerely
to
give
a
true
account
of
their
gift
of
reason
to
the
benefit
and
use
of
men
but
as
if
they
sought
in
knowledge
a
couch
whereon
to
rest
a
searching
and
wandering
spirit
or
a
terrace
for
a
wandering
and
variable
mind
to
walk
up
and
down
with
a
fair
prospect
or
a
tower
for
a
proud
mind
to
raise
itself
upon
or
a
fort
or
commanding
ground
for
strife
and
contention
or
a
shop
for
profit
and
sale
and
not
a
rich
storehouse
for
the
glory
of
the
creator
and
the
relief
of
man
estate
when
william
james
called
pragmatism
a
new
name
for
an
old
way
of
thinking
i
do
not
know
that
he
was
thinking
expressly
of
francis
bacon
but
so
far
as
concerns
the
spirit
and
atmosphere
of
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
bacon
may
be
taken
as
the
prophet
of
a
pragmatic
conception
of
knowledge
many
misconceptions
of
its
spirit
would
be
avoided
if
his
emphasis
upon
the
social
factor
in
both
the
pursuit
and
the
end
of
knowledge
were
carefully
observed
this
somewhat
résumé
of
bacon
ideas
has
not
been
gone
into
as
a
matter
of
historic
retrospect
the
summary
is
rather
meant
to
put
before
our
minds
an
authentic
document
of
the
new
philosophy
which
may
bring
into
relief
the
social
causes
of
intellectual
revolution
only
a
sketchy
account
can
be
here
attempted
but
it
may
be
of
some
assistance
even
barely
to
remind
you
of
the
direction
of
that
industrial
political
and
religious
change
upon
which
europe
was
entering
upon
the
industrial
side
it
is
impossible
i
think
to
exaggerate
the
influence
of
travel
exploration
and
new
commerce
which
fostered
a
romantic
sense
of
adventure
into
novelty
loosened
the
hold
of
traditional
beliefs
created
a
lively
sense
of
new
worlds
to
be
investigated
and
subdued
produced
new
methods
of
manufacture
commerce
banking
and
finance
and
then
reacted
everywhere
to
stimulate
invention
and
to
introduce
positive
observation
and
active
experimentation
into
science
the
crusades
the
revival
of
the
profane
learning
of
antiquity
and
even
more
perhaps
the
contact
with
the
advanced
learning
of
the
mohammedans
the
increase
of
commerce
with
asia
and
africa
the
introduction
of
the
lens
compass
and
gunpowder
the
finding
and
opening
up
of
north
and
south
america
most
significantly
called
the
new
world
these
are
some
of
the
obvious
external
facts
contrast
between
peoples
and
races
previously
isolated
is
always
i
think
most
fruitful
and
influential
for
change
when
psychological
and
industrial
changes
coincide
with
and
reinforce
each
other
sometimes
people
undergo
emotional
change
what
might
almost
be
called
a
metaphysical
change
through
intercourse
the
inner
set
of
the
mind
especially
in
religious
matters
is
altered
at
other
times
there
is
a
lively
exchange
of
goods
an
adoption
of
foreign
tools
and
devices
an
imitation
of
alien
habits
of
clothing
habitation
and
production
of
commodities
one
of
these
changes
is
so
to
speak
too
internal
and
the
other
too
external
to
bring
about
a
profound
intellectual
development
but
when
the
creation
of
a
new
mental
attitude
falls
together
with
extensive
material
and
economic
changes
something
significant
happens
this
coincidence
of
two
kinds
of
change
was
i
take
it
characteristic
of
the
new
contacts
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
clash
of
customs
and
traditional
beliefs
dispelled
mental
inertia
and
sluggishness
it
aroused
a
lively
curiosity
as
to
different
and
new
ideas
the
actual
adventure
of
travel
and
exploration
purged
the
mind
of
fear
of
the
strange
and
unknown
as
new
territories
geographically
and
commercially
speaking
were
opened
up
the
mind
was
opened
up
new
contacts
promoted
the
desire
for
still
more
contacts
the
appetite
for
novelty
and
discovery
grew
by
what
it
fed
upon
conservative
adherence
to
old
beliefs
and
methods
underwent
a
steady
attrition
with
every
new
voyage
into
new
parts
and
every
new
report
of
foreign
ways
the
mind
became
used
to
exploration
and
discovery
it
found
a
delight
and
interest
in
the
revelations
of
the
novel
and
the
unusual
which
it
no
longer
took
in
what
was
old
and
customary
moreover
the
very
act
of
exploration
of
expedition
the
process
of
enterprising
adventure
into
the
remote
yielded
a
peculiar
joy
and
thrill
this
psychological
change
was
essential
to
the
birth
of
the
new
point
of
view
in
science
and
philosophy
yet
alone
it
could
hardly
have
produced
the
new
method
of
knowing
but
positive
changes
in
the
habits
and
purposes
of
life
gave
objective
conformation
and
support
to
the
mental
change
they
also
determined
the
channels
in
which
the
new
spirit
found
exercise
newfound
wealth
the
gold
from
the
americas
and
new
articles
of
consumption
and
enjoyment
tended
to
wean
men
from
preoccupation
with
the
metaphysical
and
theological
and
to
turn
their
minds
with
newly
awakened
interest
to
the
joys
of
nature
and
this
life
new
material
resources
and
new
markets
in
america
and
india
undermined
the
old
dependence
upon
household
and
manual
production
for
a
local
and
limited
market
and
generated
quantitative
large
scale
production
by
means
of
steam
for
foreign
and
expanding
markets
capitalism
rapid
transit
and
production
for
exchange
against
money
and
for
profit
instead
of
against
goods
and
for
consumption
followed
this
cursory
and
superficial
reminder
of
vast
and
complicated
events
may
suggest
the
mutual
interdependence
of
the
scientific
revolution
and
the
industrial
revolution
upon
the
one
hand
modern
industry
is
so
much
applied
science
no
amount
of
desire
to
make
money
or
to
enjoy
new
commodities
no
amount
of
mere
practical
energy
and
enterprise
would
have
effected
the
economic
transformation
of
the
last
few
centuries
and
generations
improvements
in
mathematical
physical
chemical
and
biological
science
were
prerequisites
business
men
through
engineers
of
different
sorts
have
laid
hold
of
the
new
insights
gained
by
scientific
men
into
the
hidden
energies
of
nature
and
have
turned
them
to
account
the
modern
mine
factory
railway
steamship
telegraph
all
of
the
appliances
and
equipment
of
production
and
transportation
express
scientific
knowledge
they
would
continue
unimpaired
even
if
the
ordinary
pecuniary
accompaniments
of
economic
activity
were
radically
altered
in
short
through
the
intermediary
of
invention
watchword
that
knowledge
is
power
and
his
dream
of
continuous
empire
over
natural
forces
by
means
of
natural
science
have
been
actualized
the
industrial
revolution
by
steam
and
electricity
is
the
reply
to
bacon
prophecy
on
the
other
hand
it
is
equally
true
that
the
needs
of
modern
industry
have
been
tremendous
stimuli
to
scientific
investigation
the
demands
of
progressive
production
and
transportation
have
set
new
problems
to
inquiry
the
processes
used
in
industry
have
suggested
new
experimental
appliances
and
operations
in
science
the
wealth
rolled
up
in
business
has
to
some
extent
been
diverted
to
endowment
of
research
the
uninterrupted
and
pervasive
interaction
of
scientific
discovery
and
industrial
application
has
fructified
both
science
and
industry
and
has
brought
home
to
the
contemporary
mind
the
fact
that
the
gist
of
scientific
knowledge
is
control
of
natural
energies
these
four
facts
natural
science
experimentation
control
and
progress
have
been
inextricably
bound
up
together
that
up
to
the
present
the
application
of
the
newer
methods
and
results
has
influenced
the
means
of
life
rather
than
its
ends
or
better
put
that
human
aims
have
so
far
been
affected
in
an
accidental
rather
than
in
an
intelligently
directed
way
signifies
that
so
far
the
change
has
been
technical
rather
than
human
and
moral
that
it
has
been
economic
rather
than
adequately
social
put
in
the
language
of
bacon
this
means
that
while
we
have
been
reasonably
successful
in
obtaining
command
of
nature
by
means
of
science
our
science
is
not
yet
such
that
this
command
is
systematically
and
applied
to
the
relief
of
human
estate
such
applications
occur
and
in
great
numbers
but
they
are
incidental
sporadic
and
external
and
this
limitation
defines
the
specific
problem
of
philosophical
reconstruction
at
the
present
time
for
it
emphasizes
the
larger
social
deficiencies
that
require
intelligent
diagnosis
and
projection
of
aims
and
methods
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
remind
you
however
that
marked
political
changes
have
already
followed
upon
the
new
science
and
its
industrial
applications
and
that
in
so
far
some
directions
of
social
development
have
at
least
been
marked
out
the
growth
of
the
new
technique
of
industry
has
everywhere
been
followed
by
the
fall
of
feudal
institutions
in
which
the
social
pattern
was
formed
in
agricultural
occupations
and
military
pursuits
wherever
business
in
the
modern
sense
has
gone
the
tendency
has
been
to
transfer
power
from
land
to
financial
capital
from
the
country
to
the
city
from
the
farm
to
factory
from
social
titles
based
on
personal
allegiance
service
and
protection
to
those
based
on
control
of
labor
and
exchange
of
goods
the
change
in
the
political
centre
of
gravity
has
resulted
in
emancipating
the
individual
from
bonds
of
class
and
custom
and
in
producing
a
political
organization
which
depends
less
upon
superior
authority
and
more
upon
voluntary
choice
modern
states
in
other
words
are
regarded
less
as
divine
and
more
as
human
works
than
they
used
to
be
less
as
necessary
manifestations
of
some
supreme
and
principles
and
more
as
contrivances
of
men
and
women
to
realize
their
own
desires
the
contract
theory
of
the
origin
of
the
state
is
a
theory
whose
falsity
may
easily
be
demonstrated
both
philosophically
and
historically
nevertheless
this
theory
has
had
great
currency
and
influence
in
form
it
stated
that
some
time
in
the
past
men
voluntarily
got
together
and
made
a
compact
with
one
another
to
observe
certain
laws
and
to
submit
to
certain
authority
and
in
that
way
brought
the
state
and
the
relation
of
ruler
and
subject
into
existence
like
many
things
in
philosophy
the
theory
though
worthless
as
a
record
of
fact
is
of
great
worth
as
a
symptom
of
the
direction
of
human
desire
it
testified
to
a
growing
belief
that
the
state
existed
to
satisfy
human
needs
and
could
be
shaped
by
human
intention
and
volition
aristotle
theory
that
the
state
exists
by
nature
failed
to
satisfy
the
thought
of
the
seventeenth
century
because
it
seemed
by
making
the
state
a
product
of
nature
to
remove
its
constitution
beyond
human
choice
equally
significant
was
the
assumption
of
the
contract
theory
that
individuals
by
their
personal
decisions
expressing
their
personal
wishes
bring
the
state
into
existence
the
rapidity
with
which
the
theory
gained
a
hold
all
over
western
europe
showed
the
extent
to
which
the
bonds
of
customary
institutions
had
relaxed
their
grip
it
proved
that
men
had
been
so
liberated
from
absorption
in
larger
groups
that
they
were
conscious
of
themselves
as
individuals
having
rights
and
claims
on
their
own
account
not
simply
as
members
of
a
class
guild
or
social
grade
side
by
side
with
this
political
individualism
went
a
religious
and
moral
individualism
the
metaphysical
doctrine
of
the
superiority
of
the
species
to
the
individual
of
the
permanent
universal
to
the
changing
particular
was
the
philosophic
support
of
political
and
ecclesiastical
institutionalism
the
universal
church
was
the
ground
end
and
limit
of
the
individual
beliefs
and
acts
in
spiritual
matters
just
as
the
feudal
hierarchical
organization
was
the
basis
law
and
fixed
limit
of
his
behavior
in
secular
affairs
the
northern
barbarians
had
never
completely
come
under
the
sway
of
classic
ideas
and
customs
that
which
was
indigenous
where
life
was
primarily
derived
from
latin
sources
was
borrowed
and
more
or
less
externally
imposed
in
germanic
europe
protestantism
marked
the
formal
breaking
away
from
the
domination
of
roman
ideas
it
effected
liberation
of
individual
conscience
and
worship
from
control
by
an
organized
institution
claiming
to
be
permanent
and
universal
it
can
not
truly
be
said
that
at
the
outset
the
new
religious
movement
went
far
in
promoting
freedom
of
thought
and
criticism
or
in
denying
the
notion
of
some
supreme
authority
to
which
individual
intelligence
was
absolutely
in
bonds
nor
at
first
did
it
go
far
in
furthering
tolerance
or
respect
for
divergency
of
moral
and
religious
convictions
but
practically
it
did
tend
to
disintegration
of
established
institutions
by
multiplying
sects
and
churches
it
encouraged
at
least
a
negative
toleration
of
the
right
of
individuals
to
judge
ultimate
matters
for
themselves
in
time
there
developed
a
formulated
belief
in
the
sacredness
of
individual
conscience
and
in
the
right
to
freedom
of
opinion
belief
and
worship
it
is
unnecessary
to
point
out
how
the
spread
of
this
conviction
increased
political
individualism
or
how
it
accelerated
the
willingness
of
men
to
question
received
ideas
in
science
and
philosophy
to
think
and
observe
and
experiment
for
themselves
religious
individualism
served
to
supply
a
much
needed
sanction
to
initiative
and
independence
of
thought
in
all
spheres
even
when
religious
movements
officially
were
opposed
to
such
freedom
when
carried
beyond
a
limited
point
the
greatest
influence
of
protestantism
was
however
in
developing
the
idea
of
the
personality
of
every
human
being
as
an
end
in
himself
when
human
beings
were
regarded
as
capable
of
direct
relationship
with
god
without
the
intermediary
of
any
organization
like
the
church
and
the
drama
of
sin
redemption
and
salvation
was
something
enacted
within
the
innermost
soul
of
individuals
rather
than
in
the
species
of
which
the
individual
was
a
subordinate
part
a
fatal
blow
was
struck
at
all
doctrines
which
taught
the
subordination
of
personality
a
blow
which
had
many
political
reverberations
in
promoting
democracy
for
when
in
religion
the
idea
of
the
intrinsic
worth
of
every
soul
as
such
was
proclaimed
it
was
difficult
to
keep
the
idea
from
spilling
over
so
to
say
into
secular
relationships
the
absurdity
is
obvious
of
trying
in
a
few
paragraphs
to
summarize
movements
in
industry
politics
and
religion
whose
influence
is
still
far
from
exhausted
and
about
which
hundreds
and
thousands
of
volumes
have
been
written
but
i
shall
count
upon
your
forbearance
to
recall
that
these
matters
are
alluded
to
only
in
order
to
suggest
some
of
the
forces
that
operated
to
mark
out
the
channels
in
which
new
ideas
ran
first
there
is
the
transfer
of
interest
from
the
eternal
and
universal
to
what
is
changing
and
specific
concrete
a
movement
that
showed
itself
practically
in
carrying
over
of
attention
and
thought
from
another
world
to
this
from
the
supernaturalism
characteristic
of
the
middle
ages
to
delight
in
natural
science
natural
activity
and
natural
intercourse
secondly
there
is
the
gradual
decay
of
the
authority
of
fixed
institutions
and
class
distinctions
and
relations
and
a
growing
belief
in
the
power
of
individual
minds
guided
by
methods
of
observation
experiment
and
reflection
to
attain
the
truths
needed
for
the
guidance
of
life
the
operations
and
results
of
natural
inquiry
gained
in
prestige
and
power
at
the
expense
of
principles
dictated
from
high
authority
consequently
principles
and
alleged
truths
are
judged
more
and
more
by
criteria
of
their
origin
in
experience
and
their
consequences
of
weal
and
woe
in
experience
and
less
by
criteria
of
sublime
origin
from
beyond
everyday
experience
and
independent
of
fruits
in
experience
it
is
no
longer
enough
for
a
principle
to
be
elevated
noble
universal
and
hallowed
by
time
it
must
present
its
birth
certificate
it
must
show
under
just
what
conditions
of
human
experience
it
was
generated
and
it
must
justify
itself
by
its
works
present
and
potential
such
is
the
inner
meaning
of
the
modern
appeal
to
experience
as
an
ultimate
criterion
of
value
and
validity
in
the
third
place
great
store
is
set
upon
the
idea
of
progress
the
future
rather
than
the
past
dominates
the
imagination
the
golden
age
lies
ahead
of
us
not
behind
us
everywhere
new
possibilities
beckon
and
arouse
courage
and
effort
the
great
french
thinkers
of
the
later
eighteenth
century
borrowed
this
idea
from
bacon
and
developed
it
into
the
doctrine
of
the
indefinite
perfectibility
of
mankind
on
earth
man
is
capable
if
he
will
but
exercise
the
required
courage
intelligence
and
effort
of
shaping
his
own
fate
physical
conditions
offer
no
insurmountable
barriers
in
the
fourth
place
the
patient
and
experimental
study
of
nature
bearing
fruit
in
inventions
which
control
nature
and
subdue
her
forces
to
social
uses
is
the
method
by
which
progress
is
made
knowledge
is
power
and
knowledge
is
achieved
by
sending
the
mind
to
school
to
nature
to
learn
her
processes
of
change
in
this
lecture
as
in
the
previous
one
i
can
hardly
close
better
than
by
reference
to
the
new
responsibilities
imposed
upon
philosophy
and
the
new
opportunities
opened
to
it
upon
the
whole
the
greatest
effect
of
these
changes
up
to
date
has
been
to
substitute
an
idealism
based
on
epistemology
or
the
theory
of
knowledge
for
the
idealism
based
on
the
metaphysics
of
classic
antiquity
earlier
modern
philosophy
even
though
unconsciously
to
itself
had
the
problem
of
reconciling
the
traditional
theory
of
the
rational
and
ideal
basis
stuff
and
end
of
the
universe
with
the
new
interest
in
individual
mind
and
the
new
confidence
in
its
capacities
it
was
in
a
dilemma
on
the
one
hand
it
had
no
intention
of
losing
itself
in
a
materialism
which
subordinated
man
to
physical
existence
and
mind
to
matter
especially
just
at
the
moment
when
in
actual
affairs
man
and
mind
were
beginning
to
achieve
genuine
rule
over
nature
on
the
other
hand
the
conception
that
the
world
as
it
stood
was
an
embodiment
of
a
fixed
and
comprehensive
mind
or
reason
was
uncongenial
to
those
whose
main
concern
was
with
the
deficiencies
of
the
world
and
with
an
attempt
to
remedy
them
the
effect
of
the
objective
theological
idealism
that
had
developed
out
of
classic
metaphysical
idealism
was
to
make
the
mind
submissive
and
acquiescent
the
new
individualism
chafed
under
the
restrictions
imposed
upon
it
by
the
notion
of
a
universal
reason
which
had
once
and
for
all
shaped
nature
and
destiny
in
breaking
away
from
antique
and
medieval
thought
accordingly
early
modern
thought
continued
the
older
tradition
of
a
reason
that
creates
and
constitutes
the
world
but
combined
it
with
the
notion
that
this
reason
operates
through
the
human
mind
individual
or
collective
this
is
the
common
note
of
idealism
sounded
by
all
the
philosophies
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
whether
belonging
to
the
british
school
of
locke
berkeley
and
hume
or
the
continental
school
of
descartes
in
kant
as
everybody
knows
the
two
strains
came
together
and
the
theme
of
the
formation
of
the
knowable
world
by
means
of
a
thought
that
operated
exclusively
through
the
human
knower
became
explicit
idealism
ceased
to
be
metaphysical
and
cosmic
in
order
to
become
epistemological
and
personal
it
is
evident
that
this
development
represents
merely
a
transitional
stage
it
tried
after
all
to
put
the
new
wine
in
the
old
bottles
it
did
not
achieve
a
free
and
unbiased
formulation
of
the
meaning
of
the
power
to
direct
nature
forces
through
knowledge
that
is
purposeful
experimental
action
acting
to
reshape
beliefs
and
institutions
the
ancient
tradition
was
still
strong
enough
to
project
itself
unconsciously
into
men
ways
of
thinking
and
to
hamper
and
compromise
the
expression
of
the
really
modern
forces
and
aims
essential
philosophic
reconstruction
represents
an
attempt
to
state
these
causes
and
results
in
a
way
freed
from
incompatible
inherited
factors
it
will
regard
intelligence
not
as
the
original
shaper
and
final
cause
of
things
but
as
the
purposeful
energetic
of
those
phases
of
nature
and
life
that
obstruct
social
it
esteems
the
individual
not
as
an
exaggeratedly
ego
which
by
some
magic
creates
the
world
but
as
the
agent
who
is
responsible
through
initiative
inventiveness
and
intelligently
directed
labor
for
the
world
transforming
it
into
an
instrument
and
possession
of
intelligence
the
train
of
ideas
represented
by
the
baconian
knowledge
is
power
thus
failed
in
getting
an
emancipated
and
independent
expression
these
become
hopelessly
entangled
in
standpoints
and
prepossessions
that
embodied
a
social
political
and
scientific
tradition
with
which
they
were
completely
incompatible
the
obscurity
the
confusion
of
modern
philosophy
is
the
product
of
this
attempt
to
combine
two
things
which
can
not
possibly
be
combined
either
logically
or
morally
philosophic
reconstruction
for
the
present
is
thus
the
endeavor
to
undo
the
entanglement
and
to
permit
the
baconian
aspirations
to
come
to
a
free
and
unhindered
expression
in
succeeding
lectures
we
shall
consider
the
needed
reconstruction
as
it
affects
certain
classic
philosophic
antitheses
like
those
of
experience
and
reason
the
real
and
the
ideal
but
first
we
shall
have
to
consider
the
modifying
effect
exercised
upon
philosophy
by
that
changed
conception
of
nature
animate
and
inanimate
which
we
owe
to
the
progress
of
science
chapter
iii
the
scientific
factor
in
reconstruction
of
philosophy
philosophy
starts
from
some
deep
and
wide
way
of
responding
to
the
difficulties
life
presents
but
it
grows
only
when
material
is
at
hand
for
making
this
practical
response
conscious
articulate
and
communicable
accompanying
the
economic
political
and
ecclesiastical
changes
which
were
alluded
to
in
an
earlier
lecture
was
a
scientific
revolution
enormous
in
scope
and
leaving
unchanged
almost
no
detail
of
belief
about
nature
physical
and
human
in
part
this
scientific
transformation
was
produced
by
just
the
change
in
practical
attitude
and
temper
but
as
it
progressed
it
furnished
that
change
an
appropriate
vocabulary
congenial
to
its
needs
and
made
it
articulate
the
advance
of
science
in
its
larger
generalizations
and
in
its
specific
detail
of
fact
supplied
precisely
that
intellectual
equipment
of
ideas
and
concrete
fact
that
was
needed
in
order
to
formulate
precipitate
communicate
and
propagate
the
new
disposition
today
accordingly
we
shall
deal
with
those
contrasting
conceptions
of
the
structure
and
constitution
of
nature
which
when
they
are
accepted
on
the
authority
of
science
alleged
or
real
form
the
intellectual
framework
of
philosophy
conceptions
of
ancient
and
modern
science
have
been
selected
for
i
see
no
way
in
which
the
truly
philosophic
import
of
the
picture
of
the
world
painted
by
modern
science
can
be
appreciated
except
to
exhibit
it
in
contrast
with
that
earlier
picture
which
gave
classic
metaphysics
its
intellectual
foundation
and
confirmation
the
world
in
which
philosophers
once
put
their
trust
was
a
closed
world
a
world
consisting
internally
of
a
limited
number
of
fixed
forms
and
having
definite
boundaries
externally
the
world
of
modern
science
is
an
open
world
a
world
varying
indefinitely
without
the
possibility
of
assignable
limit
in
its
internal
a
world
stretching
beyond
any
assignable
bounds
externally
again
the
world
in
which
even
the
most
intelligent
men
of
olden
times
thought
they
lived
was
a
fixed
world
a
realm
where
changes
went
on
only
within
immutable
limits
of
rest
and
permanence
and
a
world
where
the
fixed
and
unmoving
was
as
we
have
already
noted
higher
in
quality
and
authority
than
the
moving
and
altering
and
in
the
third
place
the
world
which
men
once
saw
with
their
eyes
portrayed
in
their
imaginations
and
repeated
in
their
plans
of
conduct
was
a
world
of
a
limited
number
of
classes
kinds
forms
distinct
in
quality
as
kinds
and
species
must
be
distinct
and
arranged
in
a
graded
order
of
superiority
and
inferiority
it
is
not
easy
to
recall
the
image
of
the
universe
which
was
taken
for
granted
in
the
world
tradition
in
spite
of
its
dramatic
rendering
as
in
dante
of
the
dialectical
elaborations
of
aristotle
and
thomas
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
held
men
minds
captive
until
the
last
three
hundred
years
and
that
its
overthrow
involved
a
religious
upheaval
it
is
already
dim
faded
and
remote
even
as
a
separate
and
abstract
thing
of
theory
it
is
not
easy
to
recover
as
something
pervasive
interwoven
with
all
the
details
of
reflection
and
observation
with
the
plans
and
rules
of
behavior
it
is
impossible
to
call
it
back
again
yet
as
best
we
can
we
need
to
put
before
our
minds
a
definitely
enclosed
universe
something
which
can
be
called
a
universe
in
a
literal
and
visible
sense
having
the
earth
at
its
fixed
and
unchanging
centre
and
at
a
fixed
circumference
the
heavenly
arch
of
fixed
stars
moving
in
an
eternal
round
of
divine
ether
hemming
in
all
things
and
keeping
them
forever
at
one
and
in
order
the
earth
though
at
the
centre
is
the
coarsest
grossest
most
material
least
significant
and
good
or
perfect
of
the
parts
of
this
closed
world
it
is
the
scene
of
maximum
fluctuation
and
vicissitude
it
is
the
least
rational
and
therefore
the
least
notable
or
knowable
it
offers
the
least
to
reward
contemplation
provoke
admiration
and
govern
conduct
between
this
grossly
material
centre
and
the
immaterial
spiritual
and
eternal
heavens
lie
a
definite
series
of
regions
of
moon
planets
sun
each
of
which
gains
in
rank
value
rationality
and
true
being
as
it
is
farther
from
earth
and
nearer
the
heavens
each
of
these
regions
is
composed
of
its
own
appropriate
stuff
of
earth
water
air
fire
in
its
own
dominant
degree
until
we
reach
the
heavenly
firmament
which
transcends
all
these
principles
being
constituted
as
was
just
said
of
that
immaterial
inalterable
energy
called
ether
within
this
tight
and
pent
in
universe
changes
take
place
of
course
but
they
are
only
of
a
small
number
of
fixed
kinds
and
they
operate
only
within
fixed
limits
each
kind
of
stuff
has
its
own
appropriate
motion
it
is
the
nature
of
earthly
things
to
be
heavy
since
they
are
gross
and
hence
to
move
downward
fire
and
superior
things
are
light
and
hence
move
upward
to
their
proper
place
air
rises
only
to
the
plane
of
the
planets
where
it
then
takes
its
back
and
forth
motion
which
naturally
belongs
to
it
as
is
evident
in
the
winds
and
in
respiration
ether
being
the
highest
of
all
physical
things
has
a
purely
circular
movement
the
daily
return
of
the
fixed
stars
is
the
closest
possible
approximation
to
eternity
and
to
the
revolution
of
mind
upon
its
own
ideal
axis
of
reason
upon
the
earth
in
virtue
of
its
earthly
nature
or
rather
its
lack
of
virtue
is
a
scene
of
mere
change
mere
flux
aimless
and
meaningless
starts
at
no
definite
point
and
arrives
at
nothing
amounts
to
nothing
mere
changes
of
quantity
all
purely
mechanical
changes
are
of
this
kind
they
are
like
the
shiftings
of
the
sands
by
the
sea
they
may
be
sensed
but
they
can
not
be
noted
or
understood
they
lack
fixed
limits
which
govern
them
they
are
contemptible
they
are
casual
the
sport
of
accident
only
changes
which
lead
to
some
defined
or
fixed
outcome
of
form
are
of
any
account
and
can
have
any
account
any
or
reason
made
of
them
the
growth
of
plants
and
animals
illustrates
the
highest
kind
of
change
which
is
possible
in
the
sublunary
or
mundane
sphere
they
go
from
one
definite
fixed

only

the
material
factor
of

enters
in
but
enters
in
as
accident
to
prevent
the
full
consummation
of

and
to
bring
about
the
meaningless
variations
which
diversify

or

from

in

cases
to
produce
freaks
sports

or
men
aside
from
accidental
and
undesirable
variations
each
individual
has
a
fixed
career
to
pursue
a
fixed
path
in
which
to
travel
terms
which
sound
modern
words
like
potentiality
and
development
abound
in
aristotelian
thought
and
have
misled
some
into
reading
into
his
thought
modern
meanings
but
the
significance
of
these
words
in
classic
and
medieval
thought
is
rigidly
determined
by
their
context
development
holds
merely
of
the
course
of
changes
which
takes
place
within
a
particular
member
of
the
species
it
is
only
a
name
for
the
predetermined
movement
from
the
acorn
to
the
oak
tree
it
takes
place
not
in
things
generally
but
only
in
some
one
of
the
numerically
insignificant
members
of
the
oak
species
development
evolution
never
means
as
in
modern
science
origin
of
new
forms
a
mutation
from
an
old
species
but
only
the
monotonous
traversing
of
a
previously
plotted
cycle
of
change
so
potentiality
never
means
as
in
modern
life
the
possibility
of
novelty
of
invention
of
radical
deviation
but
only
that
principle
in
virtue
of
which
the
acorn
becomes
the
oak
technically
it
is
the
capacity
for
movement
between
opposites
only
the
cold
can
become
hot
only
the
dry
can
become
wet
only
the
babe
can
become
a
man
the
seed
the
wheat
and
so
on
potentiality
instead
of
implying
the
emergence
of
anything
novel
means
merely
the
facility
with
which
a
particular
thing
repeats
the
recurrent
processes
of
its
kind
and
thus
becomes
a
specific
case
of
the
eternal
forms
in
and
through
which
all
things
are
constituted
in
spite
of
the
almost
infinite
numerical
diversity
of
individuals
there
are
only
a
limited
number
of
species
kinds
or
sorts
and
the
world
is
essentially
a
world
which
falls
into
sorts
it
is
into
distinct
classes
moreover
just
as
we
naturally
arrange
plants
and
animals
into
series
ranks
and
grades
from
the
lower
to
the
highest
so
with
all
things
in
the
universe
the
distinct
classes
to
which
things
belong
by
their
very
nature
form
a
hierarchical
order
there
are
castes
in
nature
the
universe
is
constituted
on
an
aristocratic
one
can
truly
say
a
feudal
plan
species
classes
do
not
mix
or
overlap
except
in
cases
of
accident
and
to
the
result
of
chaos
otherwise
everything
belongs
in
advance
to
a
certain
class
and
the
class
has
its
own
fixed
place
in
the
hierarchy
of
being
the
universe
is
indeed
a
tidy
spot
whose
purity
is
interfered
with
only
by
those
irregular
changes
in
individuals
which
are
due
to
the
presence
of
an
obdurate
matter
that
refuses
to
yield
itself
wholly
to
rule
and
form
otherwise
it
is
a
universe
with
a
fixed
place
for
everything
and
where
everything
knows
its
place
its
station
and
class
and
keeps
it
hence
what
are
known
technically
as
final
and
formal
causes
are
supreme
and
efficient
causes
are
relegated
to
an
inferior
place
the
final
cause
is
just
a
name
for
the
fact
that
there
is
some
fixed
form
characteristic
of
a
class
or
sort
of
things
which
governs
the
changes
going
on
so
that
they
tend
toward
it
as
their
end
and
goal
the
fulfilment
of
their
true
nature
the
supralunar
region
is
the
end
or
final
cause
of
the
proper
movements
of
air
and
fire
the
earth
of
the
motions
of
crass
heavy
things
the
oak
of
the
acorn
the
mature
form
in
general
of
the
germinal
the
efficient
cause
that
which
produces
and
instigates
a
movement
is
only
some
external
change
as
it
accidentally
gives
a
kind
of
push
to
an
immature
imperfect
being
and
starts
it
moving
toward
its
perfected
or
fulfilled
form
the
final
cause
is
the
perfected
form
regarded
as
the
or
of
prior
changes
when
it
is
not
taken
in
reference
to
the
changes
completed
and
brought
to
rest
in
it
but
in
itself
it
is
the
formal
cause
the
inherent
or
character
which
makes
or
constitutes
a
thing
it
so
far
as
it
truly
namely
what
it
is
so
far
as
it
does
not
change
logically
and
practically
all
of
the
traits
which
have
been
enumerated
cohere
attack
one
and
you
attack
all
when
any
one
is
undermined
all
go
this
is
the
reason
why
the
intellectual
modification
of
the
last
few
centuries
may
truly
be
called
a
revolution
it
has
substituted
a
conception
of
the
world
differing
at
every
point
it
makes
little
matter
at
what
point
you
commence
to
trace
the
difference
you
find
yourself
carried
into
all
other
points
instead
of
a
closed
universe
science
now
presents
us
with
one
infinite
in
space
and
time
having
no
limits
here
or
there
at
this
end
so
to
speak
or
at
that
and
as
infinitely
complex
in
internal
structure
as
it
is
infinite
in
extent
hence
it
is
also
an
open
world
an
infinitely
variegated
one
a
world
which
in
the
old
sense
can
hardly
be
called
a
universe
at
all
so
multiplex
and
that
it
can
not
be
summed
up
and
grasped
in
any
one
formula
and
change
rather
than
fixity
is
now
a
measure
of
reality
or
energy
of
being
change
is
omnipresent
the
laws
in
which
the
modern
man
of
science
is
interested
are
laws
of
motion
of
generation
and
consequence
he
speaks
of
law
where
the
ancients
spoke
of
kind
and
essence
because
what
he
wants
is
a
correlation
of
changes
an
ability
to
detect
one
change
occurring
in
correspondence
with
another
he
does
not
try
to
define
and
delimit
something
remaining
constant
change
he
tries
to
describe
a
constant
order
change
and
while
the
word
constant
appears
in
both
statements
the
meaning
of
the
word
is
not
the
same
in
one
case
we
are
dealing
with
something
constant
in
physical
or
metaphysical
in
the
other
case
with
something
constant
in
and
operation
one
is
a
form
of
independent
being
the
other
is
a
formula
of
description
and
calculation
of
interdependent
changes
in
short
classic
thought
accepted
a
feudally
arranged
order
of
classes
or
kinds
each
holding
from
a
superior
and
in
turn
giving
the
rule
of
conduct
and
service
to
an
inferior
this
trait
reflects
and
parallels
most
closely
the
social
situation
we
were
considering
at
the
last
hour
we
have
a
fairly
definite
notion
of
society
as
organized
upon
the
feudal
basis
the
family
principle
the
principle
of
kinship
is
strong
and
especially
is
this
true
as
we
ascend
in
the
social
scale
at
the
lower
end
individuals
may
be
lost
more
or
less
in
the
mass
since
all
are
parts
of
the
common
herd
there
is
nothing
especial
to
distinguish
their
birth
but
among
the
privileged
and
ruling
class
the
case
is
quite
different
the
tie
of
kinship
at
once
marks
a
group
off
externally
and
gives
it
distinction
and
internally
holds
all
its
members
together
kinship
kind
class
genus
are
synonymous
terms
starting
from
social
and
concrete
facts
and
going
to
the
technical
and
abstract
for
kinship
is
a
sign
of
a
common
nature
of
something
universal
and
permanent
running
through
all
particular
individuals
and
giving
them
a
real
and
objective
unity
because
such
and
such
persons
are
kin
they
are
and
not
merely
conventionally
marked
off
into
a
class
having
something
unique
about
it
all
contemporary
members
are
bound
into
an
objective
unity
which
includes
ancestors
and
descendants
and
excludes
all
who
belong
to
another
kin
or
kind
assuredly
this
parcelling
out
of
the
world
into
separate
kinds
each
having
its
qualitatively
distinct
nature
in
contrast
with
other
species
binding
numerically
distinct
individuals
together
and
preventing
their
diversities
from
exceeding
fixed
bounds
may
without
exaggeration
be
called
a
projection
of
the
family
principle
into
the
world
at
large
in
a
feudally
organized
society
moreover
each
kinship
group
or
species
occupies
a
definite
place
it
is
marked
by
the
possession
of
a
specific
higher
or
lower
with
respect
to
other
grades
this
position
confers
upon
it
certain
privileges
enabling
it
to
enforce
certain
claims
upon
those
lower
in
the
scale
and
entailing
upon
it
certain
services
and
homage
to
be
rendered
to
superiors
the
relationship
of
causation
so
to
speak
is
up
and
down
influence
power
proceeds
from
above
to
below
the
activities
of
the
inferior
are
performed
with
respect
quite
literally
to
what
is
above
action
and
reaction
are
far
from
being
equal
and
in
opposite
directions
all
action
is
of
one
sort
of
the
nature
of
lordship
and
proceeds
from
the
higher
to
the
lower
reaction
is
of
the
nature
of
subjection
and
deference
and
proceeds
from
lower
to
higher
the
classic
theory
of
the
constitution
of
the
world
corresponds
point
by
point
to
this
ordering
of
classes
in
a
scale
of
dignity
and
power
a
third
trait
assigned
by
historians
to
feudalism
is
that
the
ordering
of
ranks
centres
about
armed
service
and
the
relationship
of
armed
defense
and
protection
i
am
afraid
that
what
has
already
been
said
about
the
parallelism
of
ancient
cosmology
with
social
organization
may
seem
a
fanciful
analogy
and
if
a
comparison
is
also
drawn
in
this
last
regard
there
will
be
no
doubt
in
your
minds
that
a
metaphor
is
being
forced
such
is
truly
the
case
if
we
take
the
comparison
too
literally
but
not
so
if
we
confine
our
attention
to
the
notion
of
rule
and
command
implied
in
both
attention
has
already
been
called
to
the
meaning
that
is
now
given
the
term
law
a
constant
relationship
among
changes
nevertheless
we
often
hear
about
laws
which
govern
events
and
it
often
seems
to
be
thought
that
phenomena
would
be
utterly
disorderly
were
there
not
laws
to
keep
them
in
order
this
way
of
thinking
is
a
survival
of
reading
social
relationships
into
nature
not
necessarily
a
feudal
relationship
but
the
relation
of
ruler
and
ruled
sovereign
and
subject
law
is
assimilated
to
a
command
or
order
if
the
factor
of
personal
will
is
eliminated
as
it
was
in
the
best
greek
thought
still
the
idea
of
law
or
universal
is
impregnated
with
the
sense
of
a
guiding
and
ruling
influence
exerted
from
above
on
what
is
naturally
inferior
to
it
the
universal
governs
as
the
end
and
model
which
the
artisan
has
in
mind
governs
his
movements
the
middle
ages
added
to
this
greek
idea
of
control
the
idea
of
a
command
proceeding
from
a
superior
will
and
hence
thought
of
the
operations
of
nature
as
if
they
were
a
fulfilment
of
a
task
set
by
one
who
had
authority
to
direct
action
the
traits
of
the
picture
of
nature
drawn
by
modern
science
fairly
spring
by
contrast
into
high
relief
modern
science
took
its
first
step
when
daring
astronomers
abolished
the
distinction
of
high
sublime
and
ideal
forces
operating
in
the
heavens
from
lower
and
material
forces
actuating
terrestrial
events
the
supposed
heterogeneity
of
substances
and
forces
between
heaven
and
earth
was
denied
it
was
asserted
that
the
same
laws
hold
everywhere
that
there
is
homogeneity
of
material
and
process
everywhere
throughout
nature
the
remote
and
esthetically
sublime
is
to
be
scientifically
described
and
explained
in
terms
of
homely
familiar
events
and
forces
the
material
of
direct
handling
and
observation
is
that
of
which
we
are
surest
it
is
the
better
known
until
we
can
convert
the
grosser
and
more
superficial
observations
of
things
in
the
heavens
into
elements
identical
with
those
of
things
directly
at
hand
they
remain
blind
and
not
understood
instead
of
presenting
superior
worth
they
present
only
problems
they
are
not
means
of
enlightenment
but
challenges
the
earth
is
not
superior
in
rank
to
sun
moon
and
stars
but
it
is
equal
in
dignity
and
its
occurrences
give
the
key
to
the
understanding
of
celestial
existences
being
hand
they
are
also
capable
of
being
brought
our
hand
they
can
be
manipulated
broken
up
resolved
into
elements
which
can
be
managed
combined
at
will
in
old
and
new
forms
the
net
result
may
be
termed
i
think
without
any
great
forcing
the
substitution
of
a
democracy
of
individual
facts
equal
in
rank
for
the
feudal
system
of
an
ordered
gradation
of
general
classes
of
unequal
rank
one
important
incident
of
the
new
science
was
the
destruction
of
the
idea
that
the
earth
is
the
centre
of
the
universe
when
the
idea
of
a
fixed
centre
went
there
went
with
it
the
idea
of
a
closed
universe
and
a
circumscribing
heavenly
boundary
to
the
greek
sense
just
because
its
theory
of
knowing
was
dominated
by
esthetic
considerations
the
finite
was
the
perfect
literally
the
finite
was
the
finished
the
ended
the
completed
that
with
no
ragged
edges
and
unaccountable
operations
the
infinite
or
limitless
was
lacking
in
character
just
because
it
was
being
everything
it
was
nothing
it
was
unformed
and
chaotic
uncontrolled
and
unruly
the
source
of
incalculable
deviations
and
accidents
our
present
feeling
that
associates
infinity
with
boundless
power
with
capacity
for
expansion
that
knows
no
end
with
the
delight
in
a
progress
that
has
no
external
limit
would
be
incomprehensible
were
it
not
that
interest
has
shifted
from
the
esthetic
to
the
practical
from
interest
in
beholding
a
harmonious
and
complete
scene
to
interest
in
transforming
an
inharmonious
one
one
has
only
to
read
the
authors
of
the
transition
period
say
giordano
bruno
to
realize
what
a
suffocating
sensation
they
associated
with
a
closed
finite
world
and
what
a
feeling
of
exhilaration
expansion
and
boundless
possibility
was
aroused
in
them
by
the
thought
of
a
world
infinite
in
stretch
of
space
and
time
and
composed
internally
of
infinitesimal
infinitely
numerous
elements
that
which
the
greeks
withdrew
from
with
repulsion
they
welcomed
with
an
intoxicated
sense
of
adventure
the
infinite
meant
it
was
true
something
forever
untraversed
even
by
thought
and
hence
something
forever
unknown
no
matter
how
great
attainment
in
learning
but
this
forever
unknown
instead
of
being
chilling
and
repelling
was
now
an
inspiring
challenge
to
inquiry
and
an
assurance
of
inexhaustible
possibilities
of
progress
the
student
of
history
knows
well
that
the
greeks
made
great
progress
in
the
science
of
mechanics
as
well
as
of
geometry
at
first
sight
it
appears
strange
that
with
this
advance
in
mechanics
so
little
advance
was
made
in
the
direction
of
modern
science
the
seeming
paradox
impels
us
to
ask
why
it
was
that
mechanics
remained
a
separate
science
why
it
was
not
used
in
description
and
explanation
of
natural
phenomena
after
the
manner
of
galileo
and
newton
the
answer
is
found
in
the
social
parallelism
already
mentioned
socially
speaking
machines
tools
were
devices
employed
by
artisans
the
science
of
mechanics
had
to
do
with
the
kind
of
things
employed
by
human
mechanics
and
mechanics
were
base
fellows
they
were
at
the
lower
end
of
the
social
scale
and
how
could
light
on
the
heavens
the
highest
be
derived
from
them
the
application
of
considerations
of
mechanics
to
natural
phenomena
would
moreover
have
implied
an
interest
in
the
practical
control
and
utilization
of
phenomena
which
was
totally
incompatible
with
the
importance
attached
to
final
causes
as
fixed
determiners
of
nature
all
the
scientific
reformers
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
strikingly
agree
in
regarding
the
doctrine
of
final
causes
as
cause
of
the
failure
of
science
why
because
this
doctrine
taught
that
the
processes
of
nature
are
held
in
bondage
to
certain
fixed
ends
which
they
must
tend
to
realize
nature
was
kept
in
leading
strings
it
was
cramped
down
to
production
of
a
limited
number
of
stereotyped
results
only
a
comparatively
small
number
of
things
could
be
brought
into
being
and
these
few
must
be
similar
to
the
ends
which
similar
cycles
of
change
had
effected
in
the
past
the
scope
of
inquiry
and
understanding
was
limited
to
the
narrow
round
of
processes
eventuating
in
the
fixed
ends
which
the
observed
world
offered
to
view
at
best
invention
and
production
of
new
results
by
use
of
machines
and
tools
must
be
restricted
to
articles
of
transient
dignity
and
bodily
not
intellectual
use
when
the
rigid
clamp
of
fixed
ends
was
taken
off
from
nature
observation
and
imagination
were
emancipated
and
experimental
control
for
scientific
and
practical
purposes
enormously
stimulated
because
natural
processes
were
no
longer
restricted
to
a
fixed
number
of
immovable
ends
or
results
anything
might
conceivably
happen
it
was
only
a
question
of
what
elements
could
be
brought
into
juxtaposition
so
that
they
would
work
upon
one
another
immediately
mechanics
ceased
to
be
a
separate
science
and
became
an
organ
for
attacking
nature
the
mechanics
of
the
lever
wheel
pulley
and
inclined
plane
told
accurately
what
happens
when
things
in
space
are
used
to
move
one
another
during
definite
periods
of
time
the
whole
of
nature
became
a
scene
of
pushes
and
pulls
of
cogs
and
levers
of
motions
of
parts
or
elements
to
which
the
formulae
of
movements
produced
by
machines
were
directly
applicable
the
banishing
of
ends
and
forms
from
the
universe
has
seemed
to
many
an
ideal
and
spiritual
impoverishment
when
nature
was
regarded
as
a
set
of
mechanical
interactions
it
apparently
lost
all
meaning
and
purpose
its
glory
departed
elimination
of
differences
of
quality
deprived
it
of
beauty
denial
to
nature
of
all
inherent
longings
and
aspiring
tendencies
toward
ideal
ends
removed
nature
and
natural
science
from
contact
with
poetry
religion
and
divine
things
there
seemed
to
be
left
only
a
harsh
brutal
despiritualized
exhibition
of
mechanical
forces
as
a
consequence
it
has
seemed
to
many
philosophers
that
one
of
their
chief
problems
was
to
reconcile
the
existence
of
this
purely
mechanical
world
with
belief
in
objective
rationality
and
purpose
to
save
life
from
a
degrading
materialism
hence
many
sought
to
by
way
of
an
analysis
of
the
process
of
knowing
or
epistemology
that
belief
in
the
superiority
of
ideal
being
which
had
anciently
been
maintained
on
the
basis
of
cosmology
but
when
it
is
recognized
that
the
mechanical
view
is
determined
by
the
requirements
of
an
experimental
control
of
natural
energies
this
problem
of
reconciliation
no
longer
vexes
us
fixed
forms
and
ends
let
us
recall
mark
fixed
limits
to
change
hence
they
make
futile
all
human
efforts
to
produce
and
regulate
change
except
within
narrow
and
unimportant
limits
they
paralyze
constructive
human
inventions
by
a
theory
which
condemns
them
in
advance
to
failure
human
activity
can
conform
only
to
ends
already
set
by
nature
it
was
not
till
ends
were
banished
from
nature
that
purposes
became
important
as
factors
in
human
minds
capable
of
reshaping
existence
a
natural
world
that
does
not
subsist
for
the
sake
of
realizing
a
fixed
set
of
ends
is
relatively
malleable
and
plastic
it
may
be
used
for
this
end
that
that
nature
can
be
known
through
the
application
of
mechanical
formulae
is
the
prime
condition
of
turning
it
to
human
account
tools
machines
are
means
to
be
utilized
only
when
nature
is
regarded
as
mechanical
is
systematic
invention
and
construction
of
machines
relevant
to
activities
nature
is
subdued
to
human
purpose
because
it
is
no
longer
the
slave
of
metaphysical
and
theological
purpose
bergson
has
pointed
out
that
man
might
well
be
called
he
is
distinguished
as
the
animal
this
has
held
good
since
man
was
man
but
till
nature
was
construed
in
mechanical
terms
the
making
of
tools
with
which
to
attack
and
transform
nature
was
sporadic
and
accidental
under
such
circumstances
it
would
not
have
occurred
even
to
a
bergson
that
man
capacity
was
so
important
and
fundamental
that
it
could
be
used
to
define
him
the
very
things
that
make
the
nature
of
the
scientist
esthetically
blank
and
dull
are
the
things
which
render
nature
amenable
to
human
control
when
qualities
were
subordinated
to
quantitative
and
mathematical
relationships
color
music
and
form
disappeared
from
the
object
of
the
scientist
inquiry
as
such
but
the
remaining
properties
of
weight
extension
numerable
velocity
of
movement
and
so
on
were
just
the
qualities
which
lent
themselves
to
the
substitution
of
one
thing
for
another
to
the
conversion
of
one
form
of
energy
into
another
to
the
effecting
of
transformations
when
chemical
fertilizers
can
be
used
in
place
of
animal
manures
when
improved
grain
and
cattle
can
be
purposefully
bred
from
inferior
animals
and
grasses
when
mechanical
energy
can
be
converted
into
heat
and
electricity
into
mechanical
energy
man
gains
power
to
manipulate
nature
most
of
all
he
gains
power
to
frame
ends
and
aims
and
to
proceed
in
regular
system
to
their
actualization
only
indefinite
substitution
and
convertibility
regardless
of
quality
render
nature
manageable
the
mechanization
of
nature
is
the
condition
of
a
practical
and
progressive
idealism
in
action
it
thus
turns
out
that
the
old
old
dread
and
dislike
of
matter
as
something
opposed
to
mind
and
threatening
it
to
be
kept
within
the
narrowest
bounds
of
recognition
something
to
be
denied
so
far
as
possible
lest
it
encroach
upon
ideal
purposes
and
finally
exclude
them
from
the
real
world
is
as
absurd
practically
as
it
was
impotent
intellectually
judged
from
the
only
scientific
standpoint
what
it
does
and
how
it
functions
matter
means
conditions
to
respect
matter
means
to
respect
the
conditions
of
achievement
conditions
which
hinder
and
obstruct
and
which
have
to
be
changed
conditions
which
help
and
further
and
which
can
be
used
to
modify
obstructions
and
attain
ends
only
as
men
have
learned
to
pay
sincere
and
persistent
regard
to
matter
to
the
conditions
upon
which
depends
negatively
and
positively
the
success
of
all
endeavor
have
they
shown
sincere
and
fruitful
respect
for
ends
and
purposes
to
profess
to
have
an
aim
and
then
neglect
the
means
of
its
execution
is
of
the
most
dangerous
sort
education
and
morals
will
begin
to
find
themselves
on
the
same
road
of
advance
that
say
chemical
industry
and
medicine
have
found
for
themselves
when
they
too
learn
fully
the
lesson
of
wholehearted
and
unremitting
attention
to
means
and
conditions
that
is
to
what
mankind
so
long
despised
as
material
and
mechanical
when
we
take
means
for
ends
we
indeed
fall
into
moral
materialism
but
when
we
take
ends
without
regard
to
means
we
degenerate
into
sentimentalism
in
the
name
of
the
ideal
we
fall
back
upon
mere
luck
and
chance
and
magic
or
exhortation
and
preaching
or
else
upon
a
fanaticism
that
will
force
the
realization
of
preconceived
ends
at
any
cost
i
have
touched
in
this
lecture
upon
many
things
in
a
cursory
way
yet
there
has
been
but
one
point
in
mind
the
revolution
in
our
conceptions
of
nature
and
in
our
methods
of
knowing
it
has
bred
a
new
temper
of
imagination
and
aspiration
it
has
confirmed
the
new
attitude
generated
by
economic
and
political
changes
it
has
supplied
this
attitude
with
definite
intellectual
material
with
which
to
formulate
and
justify
itself
in
the
first
lecture
it
was
noted
that
in
greek
life
prosaic
matter
of
fact
or
empirical
knowledge
was
at
a
great
disadvantage
as
compared
with
the
imaginative
beliefs
that
were
bound
up
with
special
institutions
and
moral
habitudes
now
this
empirical
knowledge
has
grown
till
it
has
broken
its
low
and
limited
sphere
of
application
and
esteem
it
has
itself
become
an
organ
of
inspiring
imagination
through
introducing
ideas
of
boundless
possibility
indefinite
progress
free
movement
equal
opportunity
irrespective
of
fixed
limits
it
has
reshaped
social
institutions
and
in
so
far
developed
a
new
morale
it
has
achieved
ideal
values
it
is
convertible
into
creative
and
constructive
philosophy
convertible
however
rather
than
already
converted
when
we
consider
how
deeply
embedded
in
customs
of
thought
and
action
the
classic
philosophy
came
to
be
and
how
congenial
it
is
to
man
more
spontaneous
beliefs
the
throes
that
attended
its
birth
are
not
to
be
wondered
at
we
should
rather
wonder
that
a
view
so
upsetting
so
undermining
made
its
way
without
more
persecutions
martyrdoms
and
disturbances
it
certainly
is
not
surprising
that
its
complete
and
consistent
formulation
in
philosophy
has
been
long
delayed
the
main
efforts
of
thinkers
were
inevitably
directed
to
minimizing
the
shock
of
change
easing
the
strains
of
transition
mediating
and
reconciling
when
we
look
back
upon
almost
all
of
the
thinkers
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
upon
all
excepting
those
who
were
avowedly
sceptical
and
revolutionary
what
strikes
us
is
the
amount
of
traditional
and
method
that
is
to
be
found
even
among
those
who
were
regarded
as
most
advanced
men
can
not
easily
throw
off
their
old
habits
of
thinking
and
never
can
throw
off
all
of
them
at
once
in
developing
teaching
and
receiving
new
ideas
we
are
compelled
to
use
some
of
the
old
ones
as
tools
of
understanding
and
communication
only
piecemeal
could
the
full
import
of
the
new
science
be
grasped
roughly
speaking
the
seventeenth
century
witnessed
its
application
in
astronomy
and
general
cosmology
the
eighteenth
century
in
physics
and
chemistry
the
nineteenth
century
undertook
an
application
in
geology
and
the
biological
sciences
it
was
said
that
it
has
now
become
extremely
difficult
to
recover
the
view
of
the
world
which
universally
obtained
in
europe
till
the
seventeenth
century
yet
after
all
we
need
only
recur
to
the
science
of
plants
and
animals
as
it
was
before
darwin
and
to
the
ideas
which
even
now
are
dominant
in
moral
and
political
matters
to
find
the
older
order
of
conceptions
in
full
possession
of
the
popular
mind
until
the
dogma
of
fixed
unchangeable
types
and
species
of
arrangement
in
classes
of
higher
and
lower
of
subordination
of
the
transitory
individual
to
the
universal
or
kind
had
been
shaken
in
its
hold
upon
the
science
of
life
it
was
impossible
that
the
new
ideas
and
method
should
be
made
at
home
in
social
and
moral
life
does
it
not
seem
to
be
the
intellectual
task
of
the
twentieth
century
to
take
this
last
step
when
this
step
is
taken
the
circle
of
scientific
development
will
be
rounded
out
and
the
reconstruction
of
philosophy
be
made
an
accomplished
fact
chapter
iv
changed
conceptions
of
experience
and
reason
what
is
experience
and
what
is
reason
mind
what
is
the
scope
of
experience
and
what
are
its
limits
how
far
is
it
a
sure
ground
of
belief
and
a
safe
guide
of
conduct
can
we
trust
it
in
science
and
in
behavior
or
is
it
a
quagmire
as
soon
as
we
pass
beyond
a
few
low
material
interests
is
it
so
shaky
shifting
and
shallow
that
instead
of
affording
sure
footing
safe
paths
to
fertile
fields
it
misleads
betrays
and
engulfs
is
a
reason
outside
experience
and
above
it
needed
to
supply
assured
principles
to
science
and
conduct
in
one
sense
these
questions
suggest
technical
problems
of
abstruse
philosophy
in
another
sense
they
contain
the
deepest
possible
questionings
regarding
the
career
of
man
they
concern
the
criteria
he
is
to
employ
in
forming
his
beliefs
the
principles
which
he
is
to
direct
his
life
and
the
ends
which
he
is
to
direct
it
must
man
transcend
experience
by
some
organ
of
unique
character
that
carries
him
into
the
failing
this
must
he
wander
sceptical
and
disillusioned
or
is
human
experience
itself
worth
while
in
its
purposes
and
its
methods
of
guidance
can
it
organize
itself
into
stable
courses
or
must
it
be
sustained
from
without
we
know
the
answers
of
traditional
philosophy
they
do
not
thoroughly
agree
among
themselves
but
they
agree
that
experience
never
rises
above
the
level
of
the
particular
the
contingent
and
the
probable
only
a
power
transcending
in
origin
and
content
any
and
all
conceivable
experience
can
attain
to
universal
necessary
and
certain
authority
and
direction
the
empiricists
themselves
admitted
the
correctness
of
these
assertions
they
only
said
that
since
there
is
no
faculty
of
pure
reason
in
the
possession
of
mankind
we
must
put
up
with
what
we
have
experience
and
make
the
most
possible
out
of
it
they
contented
themselves
with
sceptical
attacks
upon
the
transcendentalist
with
indications
of
the
ways
in
which
we
might
best
seize
the
meaning
and
good
of
the
passing
moment
or
like
locke
asserted
that
in
spite
of
the
limitation
of
experience
it
affords
the
light
needed
to
guide
footsteps
modestly
in
conduct
they
affirmed
that
the
alleged
authoritative
guidance
by
a
higher
faculty
had
practically
hampered
men
it
is
the
function
of
this
lecture
to
show
how
and
why
it
is
now
possible
to
make
claims
for
experience
as
a
guide
in
science
and
moral
life
which
the
older
empiricists
did
not
and
could
not
make
for
it
curiously
enough
the
key
to
the
matter
may
be
found
in
the
fact
that
the
old
notion
of
experience
was
itself
a
product
of
experience
the
only
kind
of
experience
which
was
then
open
to
men
if
another
conception
of
experience
is
now
possible
it
is
precisely
because
the
quality
of
experience
as
it
may
now
be
lived
has
undergone
a
profound
social
and
intellectual
change
from
that
of
earlier
times
the
account
of
experience
which
we
find
in
plato
and
aristotle
is
an
account
of
what
greek
experience
actually
was
it
agrees
very
closely
with
what
the
modern
psychologist
knows
as
the
method
of
learning
by
trial
and
error
as
distinct
from
the
method
of
learning
by
ideas
men
tried
certain
acts
they
underwent
certain
sufferings
and
affections
each
of
these
in
the
time
of
its
occurrence
is
isolated
particular
its
counterpart
is
transient
appetite
and
transient
sensation
but
memory
preserves
and
accumulates
these
separate
incidents
as
they
pile
up
irregular
variations
get
cancelled
common
features
are
selected
reinforced
and
combined
gradually
a
habit
of
action
is
built
up
and
corresponding
to
this
habit
there
forms
a
certain
generalized
picture
of
an
object
or
situation
we
come
to
know
or
note
not
merely
this
particular
which
as
a
particular
can
not
strictly
be
known
at
all
for
not
being
classed
it
can
not
be
characterized
and
identified
but
to
recognize
it
as
man
tree
stone
leather
an
individual
of
a
certain
kind
marked
by
a
certain
universal
form
characteristic
of
a
whole
species
of
thing
along
with
the
development
of
this
knowledge
there
grows
up
a
certain
regularity
of
conduct
the
particular
incidents
fuse
and
a
of
acting
which
is
general
as
far
as
it
goes
builds
up
the
skill
develops
which
is
shown
by
the
artisan
the
shoemaker
the
carpenter
the
gymnast
the
physician
who
have
regular
ways
of
handling
cases
this
regularity
signifies
of
course
that
the
particular
case
is
not
treated
as
an
isolated
particular
but
as
one
of
a
kind
which
therefore
demands
a
of
action
from
the
multitude
of
particular
illnesses
encountered
the
physician
in
learning
to
class
some
of
them
as
indigestion
learns
also
to
treat
the
cases
of
the
class
in
a
common
or
general
way
he
forms
the
rule
of
recommending
a
certain
diet
and
prescribing
a
certain
remedy
all
this
forms
what
we
call
experience
it
results
as
the
illustration
shows
in
a
certain
general
insight
and
a
certain
organized
ability
in
action
but
needless
to
insist
the
generality
and
the
organization
are
restricted
and
fallible
they
hold
as
aristotle
was
fond
of
pointing
out
usually
in
most
cases
as
a
rule
but
not
universally
of
necessity
or
as
a
principle
the
physician
is
bound
to
make
mistakes
because
individual
cases
are
bound
to
vary
unaccountably
such
is
their
very
nature
the
difficulty
does
not
arise
in
defective
experience
which
is
capable
of
remedy
in
some
better
experience
experience
itself
as
such
is
defective
and
hence
default
is
inevitable
and
irremediable
the
only
universality
and
certainty
is
in
a
region
above
experience
that
of
the
rational
and
conceptual
as
the
particular
was
a
to
image
and
habit
so
the
latter
may
become
a
to
conceptions
and
principles
but
the
latter
leave
experience
behind
untouched
they
do
not
react
to
rectify
it
such
is
the
notion
which
still
lingers
in
the
contrast
of
empirical
and
rational
as
when
we
say
that
a
certain
architect
or
physician
is
empirical
not
scientific
in
his
procedures
but
the
difference
between
the
classic
and
the
modern
notion
of
experience
is
revealed
in
the
fact
that
such
a
statement
is
now
a
charge
a
disparaging
accusation
brought
against
particular
architect
or
physician
with
plato
aristotle
and
the
scholastic
it
was
a
charge
against
the
callings
since
they
were
modes
of
experience
it
was
an
indictment
of
all
practical
action
in
contrast
with
conceptual
contemplation
the
modern
philosopher
who
has
professed
himself
an
empiricist
has
usually
had
a
critical
purpose
in
mind
like
bacon
locke
condillac
and
helvetius
he
stood
face
to
face
with
a
body
of
beliefs
and
a
set
of
institutions
in
which
he
profoundly
disbelieved
his
problem
was
the
problem
of
attack
upon
so
much
dead
weight
carried
uselessly
by
humanity
crushing
and
distorting
it
his
readiest
way
of
undermining
and
disintegrating
was
by
appealing
to
experience
as
a
final
test
and
criterion
in
every
case
active
reformers
were
empiricists
in
the
philosophical
sense
they
made
it
their
business
to
show
that
some
current
belief
or
institution
that
claimed
the
sanction
of
innate
ideas
or
necessary
conceptions
or
an
origin
in
an
authoritative
revelation
of
reason
had
in
fact
proceeded
from
a
lowly
origin
in
experience
and
had
been
confirmed
by
accident
by
class
interest
or
by
biased
authority
the
philosophic
empiricism
initiated
by
locke
was
thus
disintegrative
in
intent
it
optimistically
took
it
for
granted
that
when
the
burden
of
blind
custom
imposed
authority
and
accidental
associations
was
removed
progress
in
science
and
social
organization
would
spontaneously
take
place
its
part
was
to
help
in
removing
the
burden
the
best
way
to
liberate
men
from
the
burden
was
through
a
natural
history
of
the
origin
and
growth
in
the
mind
of
the
ideas
connected
with
objectionable
beliefs
and
customs
santayana
justly
calls
the
psychology
of
this
school
a
malicious
psychology
it
tended
to
identify
the
history
of
the
formation
of
certain
ideas
with
an
account
of
the
things
to
which
the
ideas
refer
an
identification
which
naturally
had
an
unfavorable
effect
on
the
things
but
santayana
neglects
to
notice
the
social
zeal
and
aim
latent
in
the
malice
he
fails
to
point
out
that
this
malice
was
aimed
at
institutions
and
traditions
which
had
lost
their
usefulness
he
fails
to
point
out
that
to
a
large
extent
it
was
true
of
them
that
an
account
of
their
psychological
origin
was
equivalent
to
a
destructive
account
of
the
things
themselves
but
after
hume
with
debonair
clarity
pointed
out
that
the
analysis
of
beliefs
into
sensations
and
associations
left
natural
ideas
and
institutions
in
the
same
position
in
which
the
reformers
had
placed
artificial
ones
the
situation
changed
the
rationalists
employed
the
logic
of
to
show
that
experience
giving
only
a
heap
of
chaotic
and
isolated
particulars
is
as
fatal
to
science
and
to
moral
laws
and
obligations
as
to
obnoxious
institutions
and
concluded
that
reason
must
be
resorted
to
if
experience
was
to
be
furnished
with
any
binding
and
connecting
principles
the
new
rationalistic
idealism
of
kant
and
his
successors
seemed
to
be
necessitated
by
the
totally
destructive
results
of
the
new
empirical
philosophy
two
things
have
rendered
possible
a
new
conception
of
experience
and
a
new
conception
of
the
relation
of
reason
to
experience
or
more
accurately
of
the
place
of
reason
experience
the
primary
factor
is
the
change
that
has
taken
place
in
the
actual
nature
of
experience
its
contents
and
methods
as
it
is
actually
lived
the
other
is
the
development
of
a
psychology
based
upon
biology
which
makes
possible
a
new
scientific
formulation
of
the
nature
of
experience
let
us
begin
with
the
technical
side
the
change
in
psychology
we
are
only
just
now
commencing
to
appreciate
how
completely
exploded
is
the
psychology
that
dominated
philosophy
throughout
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
according
to
this
theory
mental
life
originated
in
sensations
which
are
separately
and
passively
received
and
which
are
formed
through
laws
of
retention
and
association
into
a
mosaic
of
images
perceptions
and
conceptions
the
senses
were
regarded
as
gateways
or
avenues
of
knowledge
except
in
combining
atomic
sensations
the
mind
was
wholly
passive
and
acquiescent
in
knowing
volition
action
emotion
and
desire
follow
in
the
wake
of
sensations
and
images
the
intellectual
or
cognitive
factor
comes
first
and
emotional
and
volitional
life
is
only
a
consequent
conjunction
of
ideas
with
sensations
of
pleasure
and
pain
the
effect
of
the
development
of
biology
has
been
to
reverse
the
picture
wherever
there
is
life
there
is
behavior
activity
in
order
that
life
may
persist
this
activity
has
to
be
both
continuous
and
adapted
to
the
environment
this
adaptive
adjustment
moreover
is
not
wholly
passive
is
not
a
mere
matter
of
the
moulding
of
the
organism
by
the
environment
even
a
clam
acts
upon
the
environment
and
modifies
it
to
some
extent
it
selects
materials
for
food
and
for
the
shell
that
protects
it
it
does
something
to
the
environment
as
well
as
has
something
done
to
itself
there
is
no
such
thing
in
a
living
creature
as
mere
conformity
to
conditions
though
parasitic
forms
may
approach
this
limit
in
the
interests
of
the
maintenance
of
life
there
is
transformation
of
some
elements
in
the
surrounding
medium
the
higher
the
form
of
life
the
more
important
is
the
active
reconstruction
of
the
medium
this
increased
control
may
be
illustrated
by
the
contrast
of
savage
with
civilized
man
suppose
the
two
are
living
in
a
wilderness
with
the
savage
there
is
the
maximum
of
accommodation
to
given
conditions
the
minimum
of
what
we
may
call
hitting
back
the
savage
takes
things
as
they
are
and
by
using
caves
and
roots
and
occasional
pools
leads
a
meagre
and
precarious
existence
the
civilized
man
goes
to
distant
mountains
and
dams
streams
he
builds
reservoirs
digs
channels
and
conducts
the
waters
to
what
had
been
a
desert
he
searches
the
world
to
find
plants
and
animals
that
will
thrive
he
takes
native
plants
and
by
selection
and
improves
them
he
introduces
machinery
to
till
the
soil
and
care
for
the
harvest
by
such
means
he
may
succeed
in
making
the
wilderness
blossom
like
the
rose
such
transformation
scenes
are
so
familiar
that
we
overlook
their
meaning
we
forget
that
the
inherent
power
of
life
is
illustrated
in
them
note
what
a
change
this
point
of
view
entails
in
the
traditional
notions
of
experience
experience
becomes
an
affair
primarily
of
doing
the
organism
does
not
stand
about
waiting
for
something
to
turn
up
it
does
not
wait
passive
and
inert
for
something
to
impress
itself
upon
it
from
without
the
organism
acts
in
accordance
with
its
own
structure
simple
or
complex
upon
its
surroundings
as
a
consequence
the
changes
produced
in
the
environment
react
upon
the
organism
and
its
activities
the
living
creature
undergoes
suffers
the
consequences
of
its
own
behavior
this
close
connection
between
doing
and
suffering
or
undergoing
forms
what
we
call
experience
disconnected
doing
and
disconnected
suffering
are
neither
of
them
experiences
suppose
fire
encroaches
upon
a
man
when
he
is
asleep
part
of
his
body
is
burned
away
the
burn
does
not
perceptibly
result
from
what
he
has
done
there
is
nothing
which
in
any
instructive
way
can
be
named
experience
or
again
there
is
a
series
of
mere
activities
like
twitchings
of
muscles
in
a
spasm
the
movements
amount
to
nothing
they
have
no
consequences
for
life
or
if
they
have
these
consequences
are
not
connected
with
prior
doing
there
is
no
experience
no
learning
no
cumulative
process
but
suppose
a
busy
infant
puts
his
finger
in
the
fire
the
doing
is
random
aimless
without
intention
or
reflection
but
something
happens
in
consequence
the
child
undergoes
heat
he
suffers
pain
the
doing
and
undergoing
the
reaching
and
the
burn
are
connected
one
comes
to
suggest
and
mean
the
other
then
there
is
experience
in
a
vital
and
significant
sense
certain
important
implications
for
philosophy
follow
in
the
first
place
the
interaction
of
organism
and
environment
resulting
in
some
adaptation
which
secures
utilization
of
the
latter
is
the
primary
fact
the
basic
category
knowledge
is
relegated
to
a
derived
position
secondary
in
origin
even
if
its
importance
when
once
it
is
established
is
overshadowing
knowledge
is
not
something
separate
and
but
is
involved
in
the
process
by
which
life
is
sustained
and
evolved
the
senses
lose
their
place
as
gateways
of
knowing
to
take
their
rightful
place
as
stimuli
to
action
to
an
animal
an
affection
of
the
eye
or
ear
is
not
an
idle
piece
of
information
about
something
indifferently
going
on
in
the
world
it
is
an
invitation
and
inducement
to
act
in
a
needed
way
it
is
a
clue
in
behavior
a
directive
factor
in
adaptation
of
life
in
its
surroundings
it
is
urgent
not
cognitive
in
quality
the
whole
controversy
between
empiricism
and
rationalism
as
to
the
intellectual
worth
of
sensations
is
rendered
strangely
obsolete
the
discussion
of
sensations
belongs
under
the
head
of
immediate
stimulus
and
response
not
under
the
head
of
knowledge
as
a
element
a
sensation
marks
an
interruption
in
a
course
of
action
previously
entered
upon
many
psychologists
since
the
time
of
hobbes
have
dwelt
upon
what
they
call
the
relativity
of
sensations
we
or
sense
cold
in
transition
from
warmth
rather
than
absolutely
hardness
is
sensed
upon
a
background
of
less
resistance
a
color
in
contrast
with
pure
light
or
pure
dark
or
in
contrast
with
some
other
hue
a
continuously
unchanged
tone
or
color
can
not
be
attended
to
or
sensed
what
we
take
to
be
such
monotonously
prolonged
sensations
are
in
truth
constantly
interrupted
by
incursions
of
other
elements
and
represent
a
series
of
excursions
back
and
forth
this
fact
was
however
misconstrued
into
a
doctrine
about
the
nature
of
knowledge
rationalists
used
it
to
discredit
sense
as
a
valid
or
high
mode
of
knowing
things
since
according
to
it
we
never
get
hold
of
anything
or
intrinsically
sensationalists
used
it
to
disparage
all
pretence
at
absolute
knowledge
properly
speaking
however
this
fact
of
the
relativity
of
sensation
does
not
in
the
least
belong
in
the
sphere
of
knowing
sensations
of
this
sort
are
emotional
and
practical
rather
than
cognitive
and
intellectual
they
are
shocks
of
change
due
to
interruption
of
a
prior
adjustment
they
are
signals
to
redirections
of
action
let
me
take
a
trivial
illustration
the
person
who
is
taking
notes
has
no
sensation
of
the
pressure
of
his
pencil
on
the
paper
or
on
his
hand
as
long
as
it
functions
properly
it
operates
merely
as
stimulus
to
ready
and
effective
adjustment
the
sensory
activity
incites
automatically
and
unconsciously
its
proper
motor
response
there
is
a
preformed
physiological
connection
acquired
from
habit
but
ultimately
going
back
to
an
original
connection
in
the
nervous
system
if
the
gets
broken
or
too
blunt
and
the
habit
of
writing
does
not
operate
smoothly
there
is
a
conscious
shock
the
feeling
of
something
the
matter
something
gone
wrong
this
emotional
change
operates
as
a
stimulus
to
a
needed
change
in
operation
one
looks
at
his
pencil
sharpens
it
or
takes
another
pencil
from
one
pocket
the
sensation
operates
as
a
pivot
of
readjusting
behavior
it
marks
a
break
in
the
prior
routine
of
writing
and
the
beginning
of
some
other
mode
of
action
sensations
are
relative
in
the
sense
of
marking
transitions
in
habits
of
behavior
from
one
course
to
another
way
of
behaving
the
rationalist
was
thus
right
in
denying
that
sensations
as
such
are
true
elements
of
knowledge
but
the
reasons
he
gave
for
this
conclusion
and
the
consequences
he
drew
from
it
were
all
wrong
sensations
are
not
parts
of
knowledge
good
or
bad
superior
or
inferior
imperfect
or
complete
they
are
rather
provocations
incitements
challenges
to
an
act
of
inquiry
which
is
to
in
knowledge
they
are
not
ways
of
knowing
things
inferior
in
value
to
reflective
ways
to
the
ways
that
require
thought
and
inference
because
they
are
not
ways
of
knowing
at
all
they
are
stimuli
to
reflection
and
inference
as
interruptions
they
raise
the
questions
what
does
this
shock
mean
what
is
happening
what
is
the
matter
how
is
my
relation
to
the
environment
disturbed
what
should
be
done
about
it
how
shall
i
alter
my
course
of
action
to
meet
the
change
that
has
taken
place
in
the
surroundings
how
shall
i
readjust
my
behavior
in
response
sensation
is
thus
as
the
sensationalist
claimed
the
beginning
of
knowledge
but
only
in
the
sense
that
the
experienced
shock
of
change
is
the
necessary
stimulus
to
the
investigating
and
comparing
which
eventually
produce
knowledge
when
experience
is
aligned
with
the
and
sensations
are
seen
to
be
points
of
readjustment
the
alleged
atomism
of
sensations
totally
disappears
with
this
disappearance
is
abolished
the
need
for
a
synthetic
faculty
of
reason
to
connect
them
philosophy
is
not
any
longer
confronted
with
the
hopeless
problem
of
finding
a
way
in
which
separate
grains
of
sand
may
be
woven
into
a
strong
and
coherent
rope
or
into
the
illusion
and
pretence
of
one
when
the
isolated
and
simple
existences
of
locke
and
hume
are
seen
not
to
be
truly
empirical
at
all
but
to
answer
to
certain
demands
of
their
theory
of
mind
the
necessity
ceases
for
the
elaborate
kantian
and
machinery
of
concepts
and
categories
to
synthesize
the
alleged
stuff
of
experience
the
true
stuff
of
experience
is
recognized
to
be
adaptive
courses
of
action
habits
active
functions
connections
of
doing
and
undergoing
experience
carries
principles
of
connection
and
organization
within
itself
these
principles
are
none
the
worse
because
they
are
vital
and
practical
rather
than
epistemological
some
degree
of
organization
is
indispensable
to
even
the
lowest
grade
of
life
even
an
amoeba
must
have
some
continuity
in
time
in
its
activity
and
some
adaptation
to
its
environment
in
space
its
life
and
experience
can
not
possibly
consist
in
momentary
atomic
and
sensations
its
activity
has
reference
to
its
surroundings
and
to
what
goes
before
and
what
comes
after
this
organization
intrinsic
to
life
renders
unnecessary
a
and
synthesis
it
affords
the
basis
and
material
for
a
positive
evolution
of
intelligence
as
an
organizing
factor
within
experience
nor
is
it
entirely
aside
from
the
subject
to
point
out
the
extent
in
which
social
as
well
as
biological
organization
enters
into
the
formation
of
human
experience
probably
one
thing
that
strengthened
the
idea
that
the
mind
is
passive
and
receptive
in
knowing
was
the
observation
of
the
helplessness
of
the
human
infant
but
the
observation
points
in
quite
another
direction
because
of
his
physical
dependence
and
impotency
the
contacts
of
the
little
child
with
nature
are
mediated
by
other
persons
mother
and
nurse
father
and
older
children
determine
what
experiences
the
child
shall
have
they
constantly
instruct
him
as
to
the
meaning
of
what
he
does
and
undergoes
the
conceptions
that
are
socially
current
and
important
become
the
child
principles
of
interpretation
and
estimation
long
before
he
attains
to
personal
and
deliberate
control
of
conduct
things
come
to
him
clothed
in
language
not
in
physical
nakedness
and
this
garb
of
communication
makes
him
a
sharer
in
the
beliefs
of
those
about
him
these
beliefs
coming
to
him
as
so
many
facts
form
his
mind
they
furnish
the
centres
about
which
his
own
personal
expeditions
and
perceptions
are
ordered
here
we
have
categories
of
connection
and
unification
as
important
as
those
of
kant
but
empirical
not
mythological
from
these
elementary
if
somewhat
technical
considerations
we
turn
to
the
change
which
experience
itself
has
undergone
in
the
passage
from
ancient
and
medieval
to
modern
life
to
plato
experience
meant
enslavement
to
the
past
to
custom
experience
was
almost
equivalent
to
established
customs
formed
not
by
reason
or
under
intelligent
control
but
by
repetition
and
blind
rule
of
thumb
only
reason
can
lift
us
above
subjection
to
the
accidents
of
the
past
when
we
come
to
bacon
and
his
successors
we
discover
a
curious
reversal
reason
and
its
bodyguard
of
general
notions
is
now
the
conservative
factor
experience
is
the
liberating
power
experience
means
the
new
that
which
calls
us
away
from
adherence
to
the
past
that
which
reveals
novel
facts
and
truths
faith
in
experience
produces
not
devotion
to
custom
but
endeavor
for
progress
this
difference
in
temper
is
the
more
significant
because
it
was
so
unconsciously
taken
for
granted
some
concrete
and
vital
change
must
have
occurred
in
actual
experience
as
that
is
lived
for
after
all
the
thought
of
experience
follows
after
and
is
modelled
upon
the
experience
actually
undergone
when
mathematics
and
other
rational
sciences
developed
among
the
greeks
scientific
truths
did
not
react
back
into
daily
experience
they
remained
isolated
apart
and
medicine
was
the
art
in
which
perhaps
the
greatest
amount
of
positive
knowledge
was
obtained
but
it
did
not
reach
the
dignity
of
science
it
remained
an
art
in
practical
arts
moreover
there
was
no
conscious
invention
or
purposeful
improvement
workers
followed
patterns
that
were
handed
down
to
them
while
departure
from
established
standards
and
models
usually
resulted
in
degenerate
productions
improvements
came
either
from
a
slow
gradual
and
unacknowledged
accumulation
of
changes
or
else
from
some
sudden
inspiration
which
at
once
set
a
new
standard
being
the
result
of
no
conscious
method
it
was
fittingly
attributed
to
the
gods
in
the
social
arts
such
a
radical
reformer
as
plato
felt
that
existing
evils
were
due
to
the
absence
of
such
fixed
patterns
as
controlled
the
productions
of
artisans
the
ethical
purport
of
philosophy
was
to
furnish
them
and
when
once
they
were
instituted
they
were
to
be
consecrated
by
religion
adorned
by
art
inculcated
by
education
and
enforced
by
magistrates
so
that
alteration
of
them
would
be
impossible
it
is
unnecessary
to
repeat
what
has
been
so
often
dwelt
upon
as
to
the
effect
of
experimental
science
in
enabling
man
to
effect
a
deliberate
control
of
his
environment
but
since
the
impact
of
this
control
upon
the
traditional
notion
of
experience
is
often
overlooked
we
must
point
out
that
when
experience
ceased
to
be
empirical
and
became
experimental
something
of
radical
importance
occurred
aforetime
man
employed
the
results
of
his
prior
experience
only
to
form
customs
that
henceforth
had
to
be
blindly
followed
or
blindly
broken
now
old
experience
is
used
to
suggest
aims
and
methods
for
developing
a
new
and
improved
experience
consequently
experience
becomes
in
so
far
constructively
what
shakespeare
so
pregnantly
said
of
nature
it
is
made
better
by
no
mean
but
nature
makes
that
mean
becomes
true
of
experience
we
do
not
merely
have
to
repeat
the
past
or
wait
for
accidents
to
force
change
upon
us
we
our
past
experiences
to
construct
new
and
better
ones
in
the
future
the
very
fact
of
experience
thus
includes
the
process
by
which
it
directs
itself
in
its
own
betterment
science
reason
is
not
therefore
something
laid
from
above
upon
experience
suggested
and
tested
in
experience
it
is
also
employed
through
inventions
in
a
thousand
ways
to
expand
and
enrich
experience
although
as
has
been
so
often
repeated
this
and
of
experience
is
still
largely
technological
rather
than
truly
artistic
or
human
yet
what
has
been
achieved
contains
the
guaranty
of
the
possibility
of
an
intelligent
administering
of
experience
the
limits
are
moral
and
intellectual
due
to
defects
in
our
good
will
and
knowledge
they
are
not
inherent
metaphysically
in
the
very
nature
of
experience
reason
as
a
faculty
separate
from
experience
introducing
us
to
a
superior
region
of
universal
truths
begins
now
to
strike
us
as
remote
uninteresting
and
unimportant
reason
as
a
kantian
faculty
that
introduces
generality
and
regularity
into
experience
strikes
us
more
and
more
as
superfluous
the
unnecessary
creation
of
men
addicted
to
traditional
formalism
and
to
elaborate
terminology
concrete
suggestions
arising
from
past
experiences
developed
and
matured
in
the
light
of
the
needs
and
deficiencies
of
the
present
employed
as
aims
and
methods
of
specific
reconstruction
and
tested
by
success
or
failure
in
accomplishing
this
task
of
readjustment
suffice
to
such
empirical
suggestions
used
in
constructive
fashion
for
new
ends
the
name
intelligence
is
given
this
recognition
of
the
place
of
active
and
planning
thought
within
the
very
processes
of
experience
radically
alters
the
traditional
status
of
the
technical
problems
of
particular
and
universal
sense
and
reason
perceptual
and
conceptual
but
the
alteration
is
of
much
more
than
technical
significance
for
reason
is
experimental
intelligence
conceived
after
the
pattern
of
science
and
used
in
the
creation
of
social
arts
it
has
something
to
do
it
liberates
man
from
the
bondage
of
the
past
due
to
ignorance
and
accident
hardened
into
custom
it
projects
a
better
future
and
assists
man
in
its
realization
and
its
operation
is
always
subject
to
test
in
experience
the
plans
which
are
formed
the
principles
which
man
projects
as
guides
of
reconstructive
action
are
not
dogmas
they
are
hypotheses
to
be
worked
out
in
practice
and
to
be
rejected
corrected
and
expanded
as
they
fail
or
succeed
in
giving
our
present
experience
the
guidance
it
requires
we
may
call
them
programmes
of
action
but
since
they
are
to
be
used
in
making
our
future
acts
less
blind
more
directed
they
are
flexible
intelligence
is
not
something
possessed
once
for
all
it
is
in
constant
process
of
forming
and
its
retention
requires
constant
alertness
in
observing
consequences
an
will
to
learn
and
courage
in
in
contrast
with
this
experimental
and
intelligence
it
must
be
said
that
reason
as
employed
by
historic
rationalism
has
tended
to
carelessness
conceit
irresponsibility
and
rigidity
in
short
absolutism
a
certain
school
of
contemporary
psychology
uses
the
term
rationalization
to
denote
those
mental
mechanisms
by
which
we
unconsciously
put
a
better
face
on
our
conduct
or
experience
than
facts
justify
we
excuse
ourselves
to
ourselves
by
introducing
a
purpose
and
order
into
that
of
which
we
are
secretly
ashamed
in
like
fashion
historic
rationalism
has
often
tended
to
use
reason
as
an
agency
of
justification
and
apologetics
it
has
taught
that
the
defects
and
evils
of
actual
experience
disappear
in
the
rational
whole
of
things
that
things
evil
merely
because
of
the
partial
incomplete
nature
of
experience
or
as
was
noted
by
bacon
reason
assumes
a
false
simplicity
uniformity
and
universality
and
opens
for
science
a
path
of
fictitious
ease
this
course
results
in
intellectual
irresponsibility
and
neglect
irresponsibility
because
rationalism
assumes
that
the
concepts
of
reason
are
so
and
so
far
above
experience
that
they
need
and
can
secure
no
confirmation
in
experience
neglect
because
this
same
assumption
makes
men
careless
about
concrete
observations
and
experiments
contempt
for
experience
has
had
a
tragic
revenge
experience
it
has
cultivated
disregard
for
fact
and
this
disregard
has
been
paid
for
in
failure
sorrow
and
war
the
dogmatic
rigidity
of
rationalism
is
best
seen
in
the
consequences
of
kant
attempt
to
buttress
an
otherwise
chaotic
experience
with
pure
concepts
he
set
out
with
a
laudable
attempt
at
restricting
the
extravagant
pretensions
of
reason
apart
from
experience
he
called
his
philosophy
critical
but
because
he
taught
that
the
understanding
employs
fixed
concepts
in
order
to
introduce
connection
into
experience
and
thereby
make
known
possible
stable
regular
relationships
of
qualities
he
developed
in
german
thought
a
curious
contempt
for
the
living
variety
of
experience
and
a
curious
overestimate
of
the
value
of
system
order
regularity
for
their
own
sakes
more
practical
causes
were
at
work
in
producing
the
peculiarly
german
regard
for
drill
discipline
order
and
docility
but
kant
philosophy
served
to
provide
an
intellectual
justification
or
rationalization
of
subordination
of
individuals
to
fixed
and
universal
principles
laws
reason
and
law
were
held
to
be
synonyms
and
as
reason
came
into
experience
from
without
and
above
so
law
had
to
come
into
life
from
some
external
and
superior
authority
the
practical
correlate
to
absolutism
is
rigidity
stiffness
inflexibility
of
disposition
when
kant
taught
that
some
conceptions
and
these
the
important
ones
are
that
they
do
not
arise
in
experience
and
can
not
be
verified
or
tested
in
experience
that
without
such
injections
into
experience
the
latter
is
anarchic
and
chaotic
he
fostered
the
spirit
of
absolutism
even
though
technically
he
denied
the
possibility
of
absolutes
his
successors
were
true
to
his
spirit
rather
than
his
letter
and
so
they
taught
absolutism
systematically
that
the
germans
with
all
their
scientific
competency
and
technological
proficiency
should
have
fallen
into
their
tragically
rigid
and
superior
style
of
thought
and
action
tragic
because
involving
them
in
inability
to
understand
the
world
in
which
they
lived
is
a
sufficient
lesson
of
what
may
be
involved
in
a
systematical
denial
of
the
experimental
character
of
intelligence
and
its
conceptions
by
common
consent
the
effect
of
english
empiricism
was
sceptical
where
that
of
german
rationalism
was
apologetic
it
undermined
where
the
latter
justified
it
detected
accidental
associations
formed
into
customs
under
the
influence
of
or
where
german
discovered
profound
meanings
due
to
the
necessary
evolution
of
absolute
reason
the
modern
world
has
suffered
because
in
so
many
matters
philosophy
has
offered
it
only
an
arbitrary
choice
between
hard
and
fast
opposities
disintegrating
analysis
rigid
synthesis
complete
radicalism
neglecting
and
attacking
the
historic
past
as
trivial
and
harmful
complete
conservatism
idealizing
institutions
as
embodiments
of
eternal
reason
a
resolution
of
experience
into
atomic
elements
that
afford
no
support
to
stable
organization
a
clamping
down
of
all
experience
by
fixed
categories
and
necessary
concepts
these
are
the
alternatives
that
conflicting
schools
have
presented
they
are
the
logical
consequences
of
the
traditional
opposition
of
sense
and
thought
experience
and
reason
common
sense
has
refused
to
follow
both
theories
to
their
ultimate
logic
and
has
fallen
back
on
faith
intuition
or
the
exigencies
of
practical
compromise
but
common
sense
too
often
has
been
confused
and
hampered
instead
of
enlightened
and
directed
by
the
philosophies
proffered
it
by
professional
intellectuals
men
who
are
thrown
back
upon
common
sense
when
they
appeal
to
philosophy
for
some
general
guidance
are
likely
to
fall
back
on
routine
the
force
of
some
personality
strong
leadership
or
on
the
pressure
of
momentary
circumstances
it
would
be
difficult
to
estimate
the
harm
that
has
resulted
because
the
liberal
and
progressive
movement
of
the
eighteenth
and
earlier
nineteenth
centuries
had
no
method
of
intellectual
articulation
commensurate
with
its
practical
aspirations
its
heart
was
in
the
right
place
it
was
humane
and
social
in
intention
but
it
had
no
theoretical
instrumentalities
of
constructive
power
its
head
was
sadly
deficient
too
often
the
logical
import
of
its
professed
doctrines
was
almost
in
their
atomistic
individualism
in
devotion
to
brute
sensation
this
deficiency
played
into
the
hands
of
the
reactionary
and
obscurantist
the
strong
point
of
the
appeal
to
fixed
principles
transcending
experience
to
dogmas
incapable
of
experimental
verification
the
strong
point
of
reliance
upon
canons
of
truth
and
standards
of
morals
in
opposition
to
dependence
upon
fruits
and
consequences
in
experience
has
been
the
unimaginative
conception
of
experience
which
professed
philosophic
empiricists
have
entertained
and
taught
a
philosophic
reconstruction
which
should
relieve
men
of
having
to
choose
between
an
impoverished
and
truncated
experience
on
one
hand
and
an
artificial
and
impotent
reason
on
the
other
would
relieve
human
effort
from
the
heaviest
intellectual
burden
it
has
to
carry
it
would
destroy
the
division
of
men
of
good
will
into
two
hostile
camps
it
would
permit
the
of
those
who
respect
the
past
and
the
institutionally
established
with
those
who
are
interested
in
establishing
a
freer
and
happier
future
for
it
would
determine
the
conditions
under
which
the
funded
experience
of
the
past
and
the
contriving
intelligence
which
looks
to
the
future
can
effectually
interact
with
each
other
it
would
enable
men
to
glorify
the
claims
of
reason
without
at
the
same
time
falling
into
a
paralyzing
worship
of
authority
or
into
an
offensive
rationalization
of
things
as
they
are
chapter
v
changed
conceptions
of
the
ideal
and
the
real
it
has
been
noted
that
human
experience
is
made
human
through
the
existence
of
associations
and
recollections
which
are
strained
through
the
mesh
of
imagination
so
as
to
suit
the
demands
of
the
emotions
a
life
that
is
humanly
interesting
is
short
of
the
results
of
discipline
a
life
in
which
the
tedium
of
vacant
leisure
is
filled
with
images
that
excite
and
satisfy
it
is
in
this
sense
that
poetry
preceded
prose
in
human
experience
religion
antedated
science
and
ornamental
and
decorative
art
while
it
could
not
take
the
place
of
utility
early
reached
a
development
out
of
proportion
to
the
practical
arts
in
order
to
give
contentment
and
delight
in
order
to
feed
present
emotion
and
give
the
stream
of
conscious
life
intensity
and
color
the
suggestions
which
spring
from
past
experiences
are
worked
over
so
as
to
smooth
out
their
unpleasantnesses
and
enhance
their
enjoyableness
some
psychologists
claim
that
there
is
what
they
call
a
natural
tendency
to
obliviscence
of
the
disagreeable
that
men
turn
from
the
unpleasant
in
thought
and
recollection
as
they
do
from
the
obnoxious
in
action
every
person
knows
that
a
large
part
of
the
effort
required
in
moral
discipline
consists
in
the
courage
needed
to
acknowledge
the
unpleasant
consequences
of
one
past
and
present
acts
we
squirm
dodge
evade
disguise
cover
up
find
excuses
and
palliations
anything
to
render
the
mental
scene
less
uncongenial
in
short
the
tendency
of
spontaneous
suggestion
is
to
idealize
experience
to
give
it
in
consciousness
qualities
which
it
does
not
have
in
actuality
time
and
memory
are
true
artists
they
remould
reality
nearer
to
the
desire
as
imagination
becomes
freer
and
less
controlled
by
concrete
actualities
the
idealizing
tendency
takes
further
flights
unrestrained
by
the
rein
of
the
prosaic
world
the
things
most
emphasized
in
imagination
as
it
reshapes
experience
are
things
which
are
absent
in
reality
in
the
degree
in
which
life
is
placid
and
easy
imagination
is
sluggish
and
bovine
in
the
degree
in
which
life
is
uneasy
and
troubled
fancy
is
stirred
to
frame
pictures
of
a
contrary
state
of
things
by
reading
the
characteristic
features
of
any
man
castles
in
the
air
you
can
make
a
shrewd
guess
as
to
his
underlying
desires
which
are
frustrated
what
is
difficulty
and
disappointment
in
real
life
becomes
conspicuous
achievement
and
triumph
in
revery
what
is
negative
in
fact
will
be
positive
in
the
image
drawn
by
fancy
what
is
vexation
in
conduct
will
be
compensated
for
in
high
relief
in
idealizing
imagination
these
considerations
apply
beyond
mere
personal
psychology
they
are
decisive
for
one
of
the
most
marked
traits
of
classic
philosophy
its
conception
of
an
ultimate
supreme
reality
which
is
essentially
ideal
in
nature
historians
have
more
than
once
drawn
an
instructive
parallel
between
the
developed
olympian
pantheon
of
greek
religion
and
the
ideal
realm
of
platonic
philosophy
the
gods
whatever
their
origin
and
original
traits
became
idealized
projections
of
the
selected
and
matured
achievements
which
the
greeks
admired
among
their
mortal
selves
the
gods
were
like
mortals
but
mortals
living
only
the
lives
which
men
would
wish
to
live
with
power
intensified
beauty
perfected
and
wisdom
ripened
when
aristotle
criticized
the
theory
of
ideas
of
his
master
plato
by
saying
that
the
ideas
were
after
all
only
things
of
sense
eternalized
he
pointed
out
in
effect
the
parallelism
of
philosophy
with
religion
and
art
to
which
allusion
has
just
been
made
and
save
for
matters
of
merely
technical
import
is
it
not
possible
to
say
of
aristotle
forms
just
what
he
said
of
plato
ideas
what
are
they
these
forms
and
essences
which
so
profoundly
influenced
for
centuries
the
course
of
science
and
theology
save
the
objects
of
ordinary
experience
with
their
blemishes
removed
their
imperfections
eliminated
their
lacks
rounded
out
their
suggestions
and
hints
fulfilled
what
are
they
in
short
but
the
objects
of
familiar
life
divinized
because
reshaped
by
the
idealizing
imagination
to
meet
the
demands
of
desire
in
just
those
respects
in
which
actual
experience
is
disappointing
that
plato
and
aristotle
in
somewhat
different
fashion
and
plotinus
and
marcus
aurelius
and
saint
thomas
aquinas
and
spinoza
and
hegel
all
taught
that
ultimate
reality
is
either
perfectly
ideal
and
rational
in
nature
or
else
has
absolute
ideality
and
rationality
as
its
necessary
attribute
are
facts
well
known
to
the
student
of
philosophy
they
need
no
exposition
here
but
it
is
worth
pointing
out
that
these
great
systematic
philosophies
defined
perfect
ideality
in
conceptions
that
express
the
opposite
of
those
things
which
make
life
unsatisfactory
and
troublesome
what
is
the
chief
source
of
the
complaint
of
poet
and
moralist
with
the
goods
the
values
and
satisfactions
of
experience
rarely
is
the
complaint
that
such
things
do
not
exist
it
is
that
although
existing
they
are
momentary
transient
fleeting
they
do
not
stay
at
worst
they
come
only
to
annoy
and
tease
with
their
hurried
and
disappearing
taste
of
what
might
be
at
best
they
come
only
to
inspire
and
instruct
with
a
passing
hint
of
truer
reality
this
commonplace
of
the
poet
and
moralist
as
to
the
impermanence
not
only
of
sensuous
enjoyment
but
of
fame
and
civic
achievements
was
profoundly
reflected
upon
by
philosophers
especially
by
plato
and
aristotle
the
results
of
their
thinking
have
been
wrought
into
the
very
fabric
of
western
ideas
time
change
movement
are
signs
that
what
the
greeks
called
somehow
infect
true
being
the
phraseology
is
now
strange
but
many
a
modern
who
ridicules
the
conception
of
repeats
the
same
thought
under
the
name
of
the
finite
or
imperfect
wherever
there
is
change
there
is
instability
and
instability
is
proof
of
something
the
matter
of
absence
deficiency
incompleteness
these
are
the
ideas
common
to
the
connection
between
change
becoming
and
perishing
and
finitude
and
imperfection
hence
complete
and
true
reality
must
be
changeless
unalterable
so
full
of
being
that
it
always
and
forever
maintains
itself
in
fixed
rest
and
repose
as
bradley
the
most
dialectially
ingenious
absolutist
of
our
own
day
expresses
the
doctrine
nothing
that
is
perfectly
real
moves
and
while
plato
took
comparatively
speaking
a
pessimistic
view
of
change
as
mere
lapse
and
aristotle
a
complacent
view
of
it
as
tendency
to
realization
yet
aristotle
doubted
no
more
than
plato
that
the
fully
realized
reality
the
divine
and
ultimate
is
changeless
though
it
is
called
activity
or
energy
the
activity
knew
no
change
the
energy
did
nothing
it
was
the
activity
of
an
army
forever
marking
time
and
never
going
anywhere
from
this
contrast
of
the
permanent
with
the
transient
arise
other
features
which
mark
off
the
ultimate
reality
from
the
imperfect
realities
of
practical
life
where
there
is
change
there
is
of
necessity
numerical
plurality
multiplicity
and
from
variety
comes
opposition
strife
change
is
alteration
or
othering
and
this
means
diversity
diversity
means
division
and
division
means
two
sides
and
their
conflict
the
world
which
is
transient
be
a
world
of
discord
for
in
lacking
stability
it
lacks
the
government
of
unity
did
unity
completely
rule
these
would
remain
an
unchanging
totality
what
alters
has
parts
and
partialities
which
not
recognizing
the
rule
of
unity
assert
themselves
independently
and
make
life
a
scene
of
contention
and
discord
ultimate
and
true
being
on
the
other
hand
since
it
is
changeless
is
total
and
one
since
it
is
one
it
knows
only
harmony
and
therefore
enjoys
complete
and
eternal
good
it
perfection
degrees
of
knowledge
and
truth
correspond
with
degrees
of
reality
point
by
point
the
higher
and
more
complete
the
reality
the
truer
and
more
important
the
knowledge
that
refers
to
it
since
the
world
of
becoming
of
origins
and
perishings
is
deficient
in
true
being
it
can
not
be
known
in
the
best
sense
to
know
it
means
to
neglect
its
flux
and
alteration
and
discover
some
permanent
form
which
limits
the
processes
that
alter
in
time
the
acorn
undergoes
a
series
of
changes
these
are
knowable
only
in
reference
to
the
fixed
form
of
the
oak
which
is
the
same
in
the
entire
oak
species
in
spite
of
the
numerical
diversity
of
trees
moreover
this
form
limits
the
flux
of
growth
at
both
ends
the
acorn
coming
from
the
oak
as
well
as
passing
into
it
where
such
unifying
and
limiting
eternal
forms
can
not
be
detected
there
is
mere
aimless
variation
and
fluctuation
and
knowledge
is
out
of
the
question
on
the
other
hand
as
objects
are
approached
in
which
there
is
no
movement
at
all
knowledge
becomes
really
demonstrative
certain
perfect
truth
pure
and
unalloyed
the
heavens
can
be
more
truly
known
than
the
earth
god
the
unmoved
mover
than
the
heavens
from
this
fact
follows
the
superiority
of
contemplative
to
practical
knowledge
of
pure
theoretical
speculation
to
experimentation
and
to
any
kind
of
knowing
that
depends
upon
changes
in
things
or
that
induces
change
in
them
pure
knowing
is
pure
beholding
viewing
noting
it
is
complete
in
itself
it
looks
for
nothing
beyond
itself
it
lacks
nothing
and
hence
has
no
aim
or
purpose
it
is
most
emphatically
its
own
excuse
for
being
indeed
pure
contemplative
knowing
is
so
much
the
most
truly
and
thing
in
the
universe
that
it
is
the
highest
and
indeed
the
only
attribute
that
can
be
ascribed
to
god
the
highest
being
in
the
scale
of
being
man
himself
is
divine
in
the
rare
moments
when
he
attains
to
purely
theoretical
insight
in
contrast
with
such
knowing
the
knowing
of
the
artisan
is
base
he
has
to
bring
about
changes
in
things
in
wood
and
stone
and
this
fact
is
of
itself
evidence
that
his
material
is
deficient
in
being
what
condemns
his
knowledge
even
more
is
the
fact
that
it
is
not
disinterestedly
for
its
own
sake
it
has
reference
to
results
to
be
attained
food
clothing
shelter
etc
it
is
concerned
with
things
that
perish
the
body
and
its
needs
it
thus
has
an
ulterior
aim
and
one
which
itself
testifies
to
imperfection
for
want
desire
affection
of
every
sort
indicate
lack
where
there
is
need
and
desire
as
in
the
case
of
all
practical
knowledge
and
activity
there
is
incompleteness
and
insufficiency
while
civic
or
political
and
moral
knowledge
rank
higher
than
do
the
conceptions
of
the
artisan
yet
intrinsically
considered
they
are
a
low
and
untrue
type
moral
and
political
action
is
practical
that
is
it
implies
needs
and
effort
to
satisfy
them
it
has
an
end
beyond
itself
moreover
the
very
fact
of
association
shows
lack
of
it
shows
dependence
upon
others
pure
knowing
is
alone
solitary
and
capable
of
being
carried
on
in
complete
independence
in
short
the
measure
of
the
worth
of
knowledge
according
to
aristotle
whose
views
are
here
summarized
is
the
degree
in
which
it
is
purely
contemplative
the
highest
degree
is
attained
in
knowing
ultimate
ideal
being
pure
mind
this
is
ideal
the
form
of
forms
because
it
has
no
lacks
no
needs
and
experiences
no
change
or
variety
it
has
no
desires
because
in
it
all
desires
are
consummated
since
it
is
perfect
being
it
is
perfect
mind
and
perfect
bliss
the
acme
of
rationality
and
ideality
one
point
more
and
the
argument
is
completed
the
kind
of
knowing
that
concerns
itself
with
this
ultimate
reality
which
is
also
ultimate
ideality
is
philosophy
philosophy
is
therefore
the
last
and
highest
term
in
pure
contemplation
whatever
may
be
said
for
any
other
kind
of
knowledge
philosophy
is
it
has
nothing
to
do
beyond
itself
it
has
no
aim
or
purpose
or
function
except
to
be
philosophy
that
is
pure
beholding
of
ultimate
reality
there
is
of
course
such
a
thing
as
philosophic
which
falls
short
of
this
perfection
where
there
is
learning
there
is
change
and
becoming
but
the
function
of
study
and
learning
of
philosophy
is
as
plato
put
it
to
convert
the
eye
of
the
soul
from
dwelling
contentedly
upon
the
images
of
things
upon
the
inferior
realities
that
are
born
and
that
decay
and
to
lead
it
to
the
intuition
of
supernal
and
eternal
being
thus
the
mind
of
the
knower
is
transformed
it
becomes
assimilated
to
what
it
knows
through
a
variety
of
channels
especially
and
augustine
these
ideas
found
their
way
into
christian
theology
and
great
scholastic
thinkers
taught
that
the
end
of
man
is
to
know
true
being
that
knowledge
is
contemplative
that
true
being
is
pure
immaterial
mind
and
to
know
it
is
bliss
and
salvation
while
this
knowledge
can
not
be
achieved
in
this
stage
of
life
nor
without
supernatural
aid
yet
so
far
as
it
is
accomplished
it
assimilates
the
human
mind
to
the
divine
essence
and
so
constitutes
salvation
through
this
taking
over
of
the
conception
of
knowledge
as
contemplative
into
the
dominant
religion
of
europe
multitudes
were
affected
who
were
totally
innocent
of
theoretical
philosophy
there
was
bequeathed
to
generations
of
thinkers
as
an
unquestioned
axiom
the
idea
that
knowledge
is
intrinsically
a
mere
beholding
or
viewing
of
reality
the
spectator
conception
of
knowledge
so
deeply
engrained
was
this
idea
that
it
prevailed
for
centuries
after
the
actual
progress
of
science
had
demonstrated
that
knowledge
is
power
to
transform
the
world
and
centuries
after
the
practice
of
effective
knowledge
had
adopted
the
method
of
experimentation
let
us
turn
abruptly
from
this
conception
of
the
measure
of
true
knowledge
and
the
nature
of
true
philosophy
to
the
existing
practice
of
knowledge
nowadays
if
a
man
say
a
physicist
or
chemist
wants
to
know
something
the
last
thing
he
does
is
merely
to
contemplate
he
does
not
look
in
however
earnest
and
prolonged
way
upon
the
object
expecting
that
thereby
he
will
detect
its
fixed
and
characteristic
form
he
does
not
expect
any
amount
of
such
aloof
scrutiny
to
reveal
to
him
any
secrets
he
proceeds
to
something
to
bring
some
energy
to
bear
upon
the
substance
to
see
how
it
reacts
he
places
it
under
unusual
conditions
in
order
to
induce
some
change
while
the
astronomer
can
not
change
the
remote
stars
even
he
no
longer
merely
gazes
if
he
can
not
change
the
stars
themselves
he
can
at
least
by
lens
and
prism
change
their
light
as
it
reaches
the
earth
he
can
lay
traps
for
discovering
changes
which
would
otherwise
escape
notice
instead
of
taking
an
antagonistic
attitude
toward
change
and
denying
it
to
the
stars
because
of
their
divinity
and
perfection
he
is
on
constant
and
alert
watch
to
find
some
change
through
which
he
can
form
an
inference
as
to
the
formation
of
stars
and
systems
of
stars
change
in
short
is
no
longer
looked
upon
as
a
fall
from
grace
as
a
lapse
from
reality
or
a
sign
of
imperfection
of
being
modern
science
no
longer
tries
to
find
some
fixed
form
or
essence
behind
each
process
of
change
rather
the
experimental
method
tries
to
break
down
apparent
fixities
and
to
induce
changes
the
form
that
remains
unchanged
to
sense
the
form
of
seed
or
tree
is
regarded
not
as
the
key
to
knowledge
of
the
thing
but
as
a
wall
an
obstruction
to
be
broken
down
consequently
the
scientific
man
experiments
with
this
and
that
agency
applied
to
this
and
that
condition
until
something
begins
to
happen
until
there
is
as
we
say
something
doing
he
assumes
that
there
is
change
going
on
all
the
time
that
there
is
movement
within
each
thing
in
seeming
repose
and
that
since
the
process
is
veiled
from
perception
the
way
to
know
it
is
to
bring
the
thing
into
novel
circumstances
until
change
becomes
evident
in
short
the
thing
which
is
to
be
accepted
and
paid
heed
to
is
not
what
is
originally
given
but
that
which
emerges
after
the
thing
has
been
set
under
a
great
variety
of
circumstances
in
order
to
see
how
it
behaves
now
this
marks
a
much
more
general
change
in
the
human
attitude
than
perhaps
appears
at
first
sight
it
signifies
nothing
less
than
that
the
world
or
any
part
of
it
as
it
presents
itself
at
a
given
time
is
accepted
or
acquiesced
in
only
as
for
change
it
is
accepted
precisely
as
the
carpenter
say
accepts
things
as
he
finds
them
if
he
took
them
as
things
to
be
observed
and
noted
for
their
own
sake
he
never
would
be
a
carpenter
he
would
observe
describe
record
the
structures
forms
and
changes
which
things
exhibit
to
him
and
leave
the
matter
there
if
perchance
some
of
the
changes
going
on
should
present
him
with
a
shelter
so
much
the
better
but
what
makes
the
carpenter
a
is
the
fact
that
he
notes
things
not
just
as
objects
in
themselves
but
with
reference
to
what
he
wants
to
do
to
them
and
with
them
to
the
end
he
has
in
mind
fitness
to
effect
certain
special
changes
that
he
wishes
to
see
accomplished
is
what
concerns
him
in
the
wood
and
stones
and
iron
which
he
observes
his
attention
is
directed
to
the
changes
they
undergo
and
the
changes
they
make
other
things
undergo
so
that
he
may
select
that
combination
of
changes
which
will
yield
him
his
desired
result
it
is
only
by
these
processes
of
active
manipulation
of
things
in
order
to
realize
his
purpose
that
he
discovers
what
the
properties
of
things
are
if
he
foregoes
his
own
purpose
and
in
the
name
of
a
meek
and
humble
subscription
to
things
as
they
really
are
refuses
to
bend
things
as
they
are
to
his
own
purpose
he
not
only
never
achieves
his
purpose
but
he
never
learns
what
the
things
themselves
are
they
what
they
can
do
and
what
can
be
done
with
them
things
that
can
be
found
by
deliberate
trying
the
outcome
of
this
idea
of
the
right
way
to
know
is
a
profound
modification
in
man
attitude
toward
the
natural
world
under
differing
social
conditions
the
older
or
classic
conception
sometimes
bred
resignation
and
submission
sometimes
contempt
and
desire
to
escape
sometimes
notably
in
the
case
of
the
greeks
a
keen
esthetic
curiosity
which
showed
itself
in
acute
noting
of
all
the
traits
of
given
objects
in
fact
the
whole
conception
of
knowledge
as
beholding
and
noting
is
fundamentally
an
idea
connected
with
esthetic
enjoyment
and
appreciation
where
the
environment
is
beautiful
and
life
is
serene
and
with
esthetic
repulsion
and
depreciation
where
life
is
troubled
nature
morose
and
hard
but
in
the
degree
in
which
the
active
conception
of
knowledge
prevails
and
the
environment
is
regarded
as
something
that
has
to
be
changed
in
order
to
be
truly
known
men
are
imbued
with
courage
with
what
may
almost
be
termed
an
aggressive
attitude
toward
nature
the
latter
becomes
plastic
something
to
be
subjected
to
human
uses
the
moral
disposition
toward
change
is
deeply
modified
this
loses
its
pathos
it
ceases
to
be
haunted
with
melancholy
through
suggesting
only
decay
and
loss
change
becomes
significant
of
new
possibilities
and
ends
to
be
attained
it
becomes
prophetic
of
a
better
future
change
is
associated
with
progress
rather
than
with
lapse
and
fall
since
changes
are
going
on
anyway
the
great
thing
is
to
learn
enough
about
them
so
that
we
be
able
to
lay
hold
of
them
and
turn
them
in
the
direction
of
our
desires
conditions
and
events
are
neither
to
be
fled
from
nor
passively
acquiesced
in
they
are
to
be
utilized
and
directed
they
are
either
obstacles
to
our
ends
or
else
means
for
their
accomplishment
in
a
profound
sense
knowing
ceases
to
be
contemplative
and
becomes
practical
unfortunately
men
educated
men
cultivated
men
in
particular
are
still
so
dominated
by
the
older
conception
of
an
aloof
and
reason
and
knowledge
that
they
refuse
to
perceive
the
import
of
this
doctrine
they
think
they
are
sustaining
the
cause
of
impartial
and
disinterested
reflection
when
they
maintain
the
traditional
philosophy
of
intellectualism
that
is
of
knowing
as
something
and
but
in
truth
historic
intellectualism
the
spectator
view
of
knowledge
is
a
purely
compensatory
doctrine
which
men
of
an
intellectual
turn
have
built
up
to
console
themselves
for
the
actual
and
social
impotency
of
the
calling
of
thought
to
which
they
are
devoted
forbidden
by
conditions
and
held
back
by
lack
of
courage
from
making
their
knowledge
a
factor
in
the
determination
of
the
course
of
events
they
have
sought
a
refuge
of
complacency
in
the
notion
that
knowing
is
something
too
sublime
to
be
contaminated
by
contact
with
things
of
change
and
practice
they
have
transformed
knowing
into
a
morally
irresponsible
estheticism
the
true
import
of
the
doctrine
of
the
operative
or
practical
character
of
knowing
of
intelligence
is
objective
it
means
that
the
structures
and
objects
which
science
and
philosophy
set
up
in
contrast
to
the
things
and
events
of
concrete
daily
experience
do
not
constitute
a
realm
apart
in
which
rational
contemplation
may
rest
satisfied
it
means
that
they
represent
the
selected
obstacles
material
means
and
ideal
methods
of
giving
direction
to
that
change
which
is
bound
to
occur
anyway
this
change
of
human
disposition
toward
the
world
does
not
mean
that
man
ceases
to
have
ideals
or
ceases
to
be
primarily
a
creature
of
the
imagination
but
it
does
signify
a
radical
change
in
the
character
and
function
of
the
ideal
realm
which
man
shapes
for
himself
in
the
classic
philosophy
the
ideal
world
is
essentially
a
haven
in
which
man
finds
rest
from
the
storms
of
life
it
is
an
asylum
in
which
he
takes
refuge
from
the
troubles
of
existence
with
the
calm
assurance
that
it
alone
is
supremely
real
when
the
belief
that
knowledge
is
active
and
operative
takes
hold
of
men
the
ideal
realm
is
no
longer
something
aloof
and
separate
it
is
rather
that
collection
of
imagined
possibilities
that
stimulates
men
to
new
efforts
and
realizations
it
still
remains
true
that
the
troubles
which
men
undergo
are
the
forces
that
lead
them
to
project
pictures
of
a
better
state
of
things
but
the
picture
of
the
better
is
shaped
so
that
it
may
become
an
instrumentality
of
action
while
in
the
classic
view
the
idea
belongs
in
a
noumenal
world
hence
it
is
only
an
object
of
personal
aspiration
or
consolation
while
to
the
modern
an
idea
is
a
suggestion
of
something
to
be
done
or
of
a
way
of
doing
an
illustration
will
perhaps
make
the
difference
clear
distance
is
an
obstacle
a
source
of
trouble
it
separates
friends
and
prevents
intercourse
it
isolates
and
makes
contact
and
mutual
understanding
difficult
this
state
of
affairs
provokes
discontent
and
restlessness
it
excites
the
imagination
to
construct
pictures
of
a
state
of
things
where
human
intercourse
is
not
injuriously
affected
by
space
now
there
are
two
ways
out
one
way
is
to
pass
from
a
mere
dream
of
some
heavenly
realm
in
which
distance
is
abolished
and
by
some
magic
all
friends
are
in
perpetual
transparent
communication
to
pass
i
say
from
some
idle
to
philosophic
reflection
space
distance
it
will
then
be
argued
is
merely
phenomenal
or
in
a
more
modern
version
subjective
it
is
not
metaphysically
speaking
real
hence
the
obstruction
and
trouble
it
gives
is
not
after
all
real
in
the
metaphysical
sense
of
reality
pure
minds
pure
spirits
do
not
live
in
a
space
world
for
them
distance
is
not
their
relationships
in
the
true
world
are
not
in
any
way
affected
by
special
considerations
their
intercommunication
is
direct
fluent
unobstructed
does
the
illustration
involve
a
caricature
of
ways
of
philosophizing
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
but
if
it
is
not
an
absurd
caricature
does
it
not
suggest
that
much
of
what
philosophies
have
taught
about
the
ideal
and
noumenal
or
superiorly
real
world
is
after
all
only
casting
a
dream
into
an
elaborate
dialectic
form
through
the
use
of
a
speciously
scientific
terminology
practically
the
difficulty
the
trouble
remains
practically
however
it
may
be
metaphysically
space
is
still
real
it
acts
in
a
definite
objectionable
way
again
man
dreams
of
some
better
state
of
things
from
troublesome
fact
he
takes
refuge
in
fantasy
but
this
time
the
refuge
does
not
remain
a
permanent
and
remote
asylum
the
idea
becomes
a
standpoint
from
which
to
examine
existing
occurrences
and
to
see
if
there
is
not
among
them
something
which
gives
a
hint
of
how
communication
at
a
distance
can
be
effected
something
to
be
utilized
as
a
medium
of
speech
at
long
range
the
suggestion
or
fancy
though
still
ideal
is
treated
as
a
possibility
capable
of
realization
the
concrete
natural
world
not
as
a
superior
reality
apart
from
that
world
as
such
it
becomes
a
platform
from
which
to
scrutinize
natural
events
observed
from
the
point
of
view
of
this
possibility
things
disclose
properties
hitherto
undetected
in
the
light
of
these
ascertainments
the
idea
of
some
agency
for
speech
at
a
distance
becomes
less
vague
and
floating
it
takes
on
positive
form
this
action
and
reaction
goes
on
the
possibility
or
idea
is
employed
as
a
method
for
observing
actual
existence
and
in
the
light
of
what
is
discovered
the
possibility
takes
on
concrete
existence
it
becomes
less
of
a
mere
idea
a
fancy
a
possibility
and
more
of
an
actual
fact
invention
proceeds
and
at
last
we
have
the
telegraph
the
telephone
first
through
wires
and
then
with
no
artificial
medium
the
concrete
environment
is
transformed
in
the
desired
direction
it
is
idealized
in
fact
and
not
merely
in
fancy
the
ideal
is
realized
through
its
own
use
as
a
tool
or
method
of
inspection
experimentation
selection
and
combination
of
concrete
natural
operations
let
us
pause
to
take
stock
of
results
the
division
of
the
world
into
two
kinds
of
being
one
superior
accessible
only
to
reason
and
ideal
in
nature
the
other
inferior
material
changeable
empirical
accessible
to
turns
inevitably
into
the
idea
that
knowledge
is
contemplative
in
nature
it
assumes
a
contrast
between
theory
and
practice
which
was
all
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
latter
but
in
the
actual
course
of
the
development
of
science
a
tremendous
change
has
come
about
when
the
practice
of
knowledge
ceased
to
be
dialectical
and
became
experimental
knowing
became
preoccupied
with
changes
and
the
test
of
knowledge
became
the
ability
to
bring
about
certain
changes
knowing
for
the
experimental
sciences
means
a
certain
kind
of
intelligently
conducted
doing
it
ceases
to
be
contemplative
and
becomes
in
a
true
sense
practical
now
this
implies
that
philosophy
unless
it
is
to
undergo
a
complete
break
with
the
authorized
spirit
of
science
must
also
alter
its
nature
it
must
assume
a
practical
nature
it
must
become
operative
and
experimental
and
we
have
pointed
out
what
an
enormous
change
this
transformation
of
philosophy
entails
in
the
two
conceptions
which
have
played
the
greatest
rôle
in
historic
philosophizing
the
conceptions
of
the
real
and
ideal
respectively
the
former
ceases
to
be
something
and
final
it
becomes
that
which
has
to
be
accepted
as
the
material
of
change
as
the
obstructions
and
the
means
of
certain
specific
desired
changes
the
ideal
and
rational
also
ceased
to
be
a
separate
world
incapable
of
being
used
as
a
lever
to
transform
the
actual
empirical
world
a
mere
asylum
from
empirical
deficiencies
they
represent
intelligently
possibilities
the
existent
world
which
may
be
used
as
methods
for
making
over
and
improving
it
philosophically
speaking
this
is
the
great
difference
involved
in
the
change
from
knowledge
and
philosophy
as
contemplative
to
operative
the
change
does
not
mean
the
lowering
in
dignity
of
philosophy
from
a
lofty
plane
to
one
of
gross
utilitarianism
it
signifies
that
the
prime
function
of
philosophy
is
that
of
rationalizing
the
of
experience
especially
collective
human
experience
the
scope
of
this
change
may
be
realized
by
considering
how
far
we
are
from
accomplishing
it
in
spite
of
inventions
which
enable
men
to
use
the
energies
of
nature
for
their
purposes
we
are
still
far
from
habitually
treating
knowledge
as
the
method
of
active
control
of
nature
and
of
experience
we
tend
to
think
of
it
after
the
model
of
a
spectator
viewing
a
finished
picture
rather
than
after
that
of
the
artist
producing
the
painting
thus
there
arise
all
the
questions
of
epistemology
with
which
the
technical
student
of
philosophy
is
so
familiar
and
which
have
made
modern
philosophy
in
especial
so
remote
from
the
understanding
of
the
everyday
person
and
from
the
results
and
processes
of
science
for
these
questions
all
spring
from
the
assumption
of
a
merely
beholding
mind
on
one
side
and
a
foreign
and
remote
object
to
be
viewed
and
noted
on
the
other
they
ask
how
a
mind
and
world
subject
and
object
so
separate
and
independent
can
by
any
possibility
come
into
such
relationship
to
each
other
as
to
make
true
knowledge
possible
if
knowing
were
habitually
conceived
of
as
active
and
operative
after
the
analogy
of
experiment
guided
by
hypothesis
or
of
invention
guided
by
the
imagination
of
some
possibility
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
first
effect
would
be
to
emancipate
philosophy
from
all
the
epistemological
puzzles
which
now
perplex
it
for
these
all
arise
from
a
conception
of
the
relation
of
mind
and
world
subject
and
object
in
knowing
which
assumes
that
to
know
is
to
seize
upon
what
is
already
in
existence
modern
philosophic
thought
has
been
so
preoccupied
with
these
puzzles
of
epistemology
and
the
disputes
between
realist
and
idealist
between
phenomenalist
and
absolutist
that
many
students
are
at
a
loss
to
know
what
would
be
left
for
philosophy
if
there
were
removed
both
the
metaphysical
task
of
distinguishing
between
the
noumenal
and
phenomenal
worlds
and
the
epistemological
task
of
telling
how
a
separate
subject
can
know
an
independent
object
but
would
not
the
elimination
of
these
traditional
problems
permit
philosophy
to
devote
itself
to
a
more
fruitful
and
more
needed
task
would
it
not
encourage
philosophy
to
face
the
great
social
and
moral
defects
and
troubles
from
which
humanity
suffers
to
concentrate
its
attention
upon
clearing
up
the
causes
and
exact
nature
of
these
evils
and
upon
developing
a
clear
idea
of
better
social
possibilities
in
short
upon
projecting
an
idea
or
ideal
which
instead
of
expressing
the
notion
of
another
world
or
some
unrealizable
goal
would
be
used
as
a
method
of
understanding
and
rectifying
specific
social
ills
this
is
a
vague
statement
but
note
in
the
first
place
that
such
a
conception
of
the
proper
province
of
philosophy
where
it
is
released
from
vain
metaphysics
and
idle
epistemology
is
in
line
with
the
origin
of
philosophy
sketched
in
the
first
hour
and
in
the
second
place
note
how
contemporary
society
the
world
over
is
in
need
of
more
general
and
fundamental
enlightenment
and
guidance
than
it
now
possesses
i
have
tried
to
show
that
a
radical
change
of
the
conception
of
knowledge
from
contemplative
to
active
is
the
inevitable
result
of
the
way
in
which
inquiry
and
invention
are
now
conducted
but
in
claiming
this
it
must
also
be
conceded
or
rather
asserted
that
so
far
the
change
has
influenced
for
the
most
part
only
the
more
technical
side
of
human
life
the
sciences
have
created
new
industrial
arts
man
physical
command
of
natural
energies
has
been
indefinitely
multiplied
there
is
control
of
the
sources
of
material
wealth
and
prosperity
what
would
once
have
been
miracles
are
now
daily
performed
with
steam
and
coal
and
electricity
and
air
and
with
the
human
body
but
there
are
few
persons
optimistic
enough
to
declare
that
any
similar
command
of
the
forces
which
control
man
social
and
moral
welfare
has
been
achieved
where
is
the
moral
progress
that
corresponds
to
our
economic
accomplishments
the
latter
is
the
direct
fruit
of
the
revolution
that
has
been
wrought
in
physical
science
but
where
is
there
a
corresponding
human
science
and
art
not
only
has
the
improvement
in
the
method
of
knowing
remained
so
far
mainly
limited
to
technical
and
economic
matters
but
this
progress
has
brought
with
it
serious
new
moral
disturbances
i
need
only
cite
the
late
war
the
problem
of
capital
and
labor
the
relation
of
economic
classes
the
fact
that
while
the
new
science
has
achieved
wonders
in
medicine
and
surgery
it
has
also
produced
and
spread
occasions
for
diseases
and
weaknesses
these
considerations
indicate
to
us
how
undeveloped
are
our
politics
how
crude
and
primitive
our
education
how
passive
and
inert
our
morals
the
causes
remain
which
brought
philosophy
into
existence
as
an
attempt
to
find
an
intelligent
substitute
for
blind
custom
and
blind
impulse
as
guides
to
life
and
conduct
the
attempt
has
not
been
successfully
accomplished
is
there
not
reason
for
believing
that
the
release
of
philosophy
from
its
burden
of
sterile
metaphysics
and
sterile
epistemology
instead
of
depriving
philosophy
of
problems
and
would
open
a
way
to
questions
of
the
most
perplexing
and
the
most
significant
sort
let
me
specify
one
problem
quite
directly
suggested
by
certain
points
in
this
lecture
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
really
fruitful
application
of
the
contemplative
idea
was
not
in
science
but
in
the
esthetic
field
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
any
high
development
of
the
fine
arts
except
where
there
is
curious
and
loving
interest
in
forms
and
motions
of
the
world
quite
irrespective
of
any
use
to
which
they
may
be
put
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
every
people
that
has
attained
a
high
esthetic
development
has
been
a
people
in
which
the
contemplative
attitude
has
flourished
as
the
greek
the
hindoo
the
medieval
christian
on
the
other
hand
the
scientific
attitude
that
has
actually
proved
itself
in
scientific
progress
is
as
has
been
pointed
out
a
practical
attitude
it
takes
forms
as
disguises
for
hidden
processes
its
interest
in
change
is
in
what
it
leads
to
what
can
be
done
with
it
to
what
use
it
can
be
put
while
it
has
brought
nature
under
control
there
is
something
hard
and
aggressive
in
its
attitude
toward
nature
unfavorable
to
the
esthetic
enjoyment
of
the
world
surely
there
is
no
more
significant
question
before
the
world
than
this
question
of
the
possibility
and
method
of
reconciliation
of
the
attitudes
of
practical
science
and
contemplative
esthetic
appreciation
without
the
former
man
will
be
the
sport
and
victim
of
natural
forces
which
he
can
not
use
or
control
without
the
latter
mankind
might
become
a
race
of
economic
monsters
restlessly
driving
hard
bargains
with
nature
and
with
one
another
bored
with
leisure
or
capable
of
putting
it
to
use
only
in
ostentatious
display
and
extravagant
dissipation
like
other
moral
questions
this
matter
is
social
and
even
political
the
western
peoples
advanced
earlier
on
the
path
of
experimental
science
and
its
applications
in
control
of
nature
than
the
oriental
it
is
not
i
suppose
wholly
fanciful
to
believe
that
the
latter
have
embodied
in
their
habits
of
life
more
of
the
contemplative
esthetic
and
speculatively
religious
temper
and
the
former
more
of
the
scientific
industrial
and
practical
this
difference
and
others
which
have
grown
up
around
it
is
one
barrier
to
easy
mutual
understanding
and
one
source
of
misunderstanding
the
philosophy
which
then
makes
a
serious
effort
to
comprehend
these
respective
attitudes
in
their
relation
and
due
balance
could
hardly
fail
to
promote
the
capacity
of
peoples
to
profit
by
one
another
experience
and
to
more
effectually
with
one
another
in
the
tasks
of
fruitful
culture
indeed
it
is
incredible
that
the
question
of
the
relation
of
the
real
and
the
ideal
should
ever
have
been
thought
to
be
a
problem
belonging
distinctively
to
philosophy
the
very
fact
that
this
most
serious
of
all
human
issues
has
been
taken
possession
of
by
philosophy
is
only
another
proof
of
the
disasters
that
follow
in
the
wake
of
regarding
knowledge
and
intellect
as
something
never
have
the
real
and
the
ideal
been
so
clamorous
so
as
at
the
present
time
and
never
in
the
history
of
the
world
have
they
been
so
far
apart
the
world
war
was
carried
on
for
purely
ideal
ends
for
humanity
justice
and
equal
liberty
for
strong
and
weak
alike
and
it
was
carried
on
by
realistic
means
of
applied
science
by
high
explosives
and
bombing
airplanes
and
blockading
marvels
of
mechanism
that
reduced
the
world
well
nigh
to
ruin
so
that
the
are
concerned
for
the
perpetuity
of
those
choice
values
we
call
civilization
the
peace
settlement
is
loudly
proclaimed
in
the
name
of
the
ideals
that
stir
man
deepest
emotions
but
with
the
most
realistic
attention
to
details
of
economic
advantage
distributed
in
proportion
to
physical
power
to
create
future
disturbances
it
is
not
surprising
that
some
men
are
brought
to
regard
all
idealism
as
a
mere
behind
which
the
search
for
material
profit
may
be
more
effectually
carried
on
and
are
converted
to
the
materialistic
interpretation
of
history
reality
is
then
conceived
as
physical
force
and
as
sensations
of
power
profit
and
enjoyment
any
politics
that
takes
account
of
other
factors
save
as
elements
of
clever
propaganda
and
for
control
of
those
human
beings
who
have
not
become
realistically
enlightened
is
based
on
illusions
but
others
are
equally
sure
that
the
real
lesson
of
the
war
is
that
humanity
took
its
first
great
wrong
step
when
it
entered
upon
a
cultivation
of
physical
science
and
an
application
of
the
fruits
of
science
to
the
improvement
of
the
instruments
of
life
industry
and
commerce
they
will
sigh
for
the
return
of
the
day
when
while
the
great
mass
died
as
they
were
born
in
animal
fashion
the
few
elect
devoted
themselves
not
to
science
and
the
material
decencies
and
comforts
of
existence
but
to
ideal
things
the
things
of
the
spirit
yet
the
most
obvious
conclusion
would
seem
to
be
the
impotency
and
the
harmfulness
of
any
and
every
ideal
that
is
proclaimed
wholesale
and
in
the
abstract
that
is
as
something
in
itself
apart
from
the
detailed
concrete
existences
whose
moving
possibilities
it
embodies
the
true
moral
would
seem
to
lie
in
enforcing
the
tragedy
of
that
idealism
which
believes
in
a
spiritual
world
which
exists
in
and
by
itself
and
the
tragic
need
for
the
most
realistic
study
of
forces
and
consequences
a
study
conducted
in
a
more
scientifically
accurate
and
complete
manner
than
that
of
the
professed
for
it
is
not
truly
realistic
or
scientific
to
take
short
views
to
sacrifice
the
future
to
immediate
pressure
to
ignore
facts
and
forces
that
are
disagreeable
and
to
magnify
the
enduring
quality
of
whatever
falls
in
with
immediate
desire
it
is
false
that
the
evils
of
the
situation
arise
from
absence
of
ideals
they
spring
from
wrong
ideals
and
these
wrong
ideals
have
in
turn
their
foundation
in
the
absence
in
social
matters
of
that
methodic
systematic
impartial
critical
searching
inquiry
into
real
and
operative
conditions
which
we
call
science
and
which
has
brought
man
in
the
technical
realm
to
the
command
of
physical
energies
philosophy
let
it
be
repeated
can
not
solve
the
problem
of
the
relation
of
the
ideal
and
the
real
that
is
the
standing
problem
of
life
but
it
can
at
least
lighten
the
burden
of
humanity
in
dealing
with
the
problem
by
emancipating
mankind
from
the
errors
which
philosophy
has
itself
fostered
the
existence
of
conditions
which
are
real
apart
from
their
movement
into
something
new
and
different
and
the
existence
of
ideals
spirit
and
reason
independent
of
the
possibilities
of
the
material
and
physical
for
as
long
as
humanity
is
committed
to
this
radically
false
bias
it
will
walk
forward
with
blinded
eyes
and
bound
limbs
and
philosophy
can
effect
if
it
will
something
more
than
this
negative
task
it
can
make
it
easier
for
mankind
to
take
the
right
steps
in
action
by
making
it
clear
that
a
sympathetic
and
integral
intelligence
brought
to
bear
upon
the
observation
and
understanding
of
concrete
social
events
and
forces
can
form
ideals
that
is
aims
which
shall
not
be
either
illusions
or
mere
emotional
compensations
chapter
vi
the
significance
of
logical
reconstruction
logic
like
philosophy
itself
suffers
from
a
curious
oscillation
it
is
elevated
into
the
supreme
and
legislative
science
only
to
fall
into
the
trivial
estate
of
keeper
of
such
statements
as
a
is
a
and
the
scholastic
verses
for
the
syllogistic
rules
it
claims
power
to
state
the
laws
of
the
ultimate
structure
of
the
universe
on
the
ground
that
it
deals
with
the
laws
of
thought
which
are
the
laws
according
to
which
reason
has
formed
the
world
then
it
limits
its
pretensions
to
laws
of
correct
reasoning
which
is
correct
even
though
it
leads
to
no
matter
of
fact
or
even
to
material
falsity
it
is
regarded
by
the
modern
objective
idealist
as
the
adequate
substitute
for
ancient
ontological
metaphysics
but
others
treat
it
as
that
branch
of
rhetoric
which
teaches
proficiency
in
argumentation
for
a
time
a
superficial
compromise
equilibrium
was
maintained
wherein
the
logic
of
formal
demonstration
which
the
middle
ages
extracted
from
aristotle
was
supplemented
by
an
inductive
logic
of
discovery
of
truth
that
mill
extracted
from
the
practice
of
scientific
men
but
students
of
german
philosophy
of
mathematics
and
of
psychology
no
matter
how
much
they
attacked
one
another
have
made
common
cause
in
attack
upon
the
orthodox
logics
both
of
deductive
proof
and
inductive
discovery
logical
theory
presents
a
scene
of
chaos
there
is
little
agreement
as
to
its
scope
or
purpose
this
disagreement
is
not
formal
or
nominal
but
affects
the
treatment
of
every
topic
take
such
a
rudimentary
matter
as
the
nature
of
judgment
reputable
authority
can
be
quoted
in
behalf
of
every
possible
permutation
of
doctrine
judgment
is
the
central
thing
in
logic
and
judgment
is
not
logical
at
all
but
personal
and
psychological
if
logical
it
is
the
primary
function
to
which
both
conception
and
inference
are
subordinate
and
it
is
an
from
them
the
distinction
of
subject
and
predicate
is
necessary
and
it
is
totally
irrelevant
or
again
though
it
is
found
in
some
cases
it
is
not
of
great
importance
among
those
who
hold
that
the
relationship
is
essential
some
hold
that
judgment
is
an
analysis
of
something
prior
into
them
and
others
assert
that
it
is
a
synthesis
of
them
into
something
else
some
hold
that
reality
is
always
the
subject
of
judgment
and
others
that
reality
is
logically
irrelevant
among
those
who
deny
that
judgment
is
the
attribution
of
predicate
to
subject
who
regard
it
as
a
relation
of
elements
some
hold
that
the
relation
is
internal
some
that
it
is
external
and
others
that
it
is
sometimes
one
and
sometimes
the
other
unless
logic
is
a
matter
of
some
practical
account
these
contrarieties
are
so
numerous
so
extensive
and
so
irreconcilable
that
they
are
ludicrous
if
logic
is
an
affair
of
practical
moment
then
these
inconsistencies
are
serious
they
testify
to
some
cause
of
intellectual
disagreement
and
incoherency
in
fact
contemporary
logical
theory
is
the
ground
upon
which
all
philosophical
differences
and
disputes
are
gathered
together
and
focussed
how
does
the
modification
in
the
traditional
conception
of
the
relation
of
experience
and
reason
the
real
and
ideal
affect
logic
it
affects
in
the
first
place
the
nature
of
logic
itself
if
thought
or
intelligence
is
the
means
of
intentional
reconstruction
of
experience
then
logic
as
an
account
of
the
procedure
of
thought
is
not
purely
formal
it
is
not
confined
to
laws
of
formally
correct
reasoning
apart
from
truth
of
neither
on
the
contrary
is
it
concerned
with
the
inherent
thought
structures
of
the
universe
as
hegel
logic
would
have
it
nor
with
the
successive
approaches
of
human
thought
to
this
objective
thought
structure
as
the
logic
of
lotze
bosanquet
and
other
epistemological
logicians
would
have
it
if
thinking
is
the
way
in
which
deliberate
reorganization
of
experience
is
secured
then
logic
is
such
a
clarified
and
systematized
formulation
of
the
procedures
of
thinking
as
will
enable
the
desired
reconstruction
to
go
on
more
economically
and
efficiently
in
language
familiar
to
students
logic
is
both
a
science
and
an
art
a
science
so
far
as
it
gives
an
organized
and
tested
descriptive
account
of
the
way
in
which
thought
actually
goes
on
an
art
so
far
as
on
the
basis
of
this
description
it
projects
methods
by
which
future
thinking
shall
take
advantage
of
the
operations
that
lead
to
success
and
avoid
those
which
result
in
failure
thus
is
answered
the
dispute
whether
logic
is
empirical
or
normative
psychological
or
regulative
it
is
both
logic
is
based
on
a
definite
and
executive
supply
of
empirical
material
men
have
been
thinking
for
ages
they
have
observed
inferred
and
reasoned
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
to
all
kinds
of
results
anthropology
the
study
of
the
origin
of
myth
legend
and
cult
linguistics
and
grammar
rhetoric
and
former
logical
compositions
all
tell
us
how
men
have
thought
and
what
have
been
the
purposes
and
consequences
of
different
kinds
of
thinking
psychology
experimental
and
pathological
makes
important
contributions
to
our
knowledge
of
how
thinking
goes
on
and
to
what
effect
especially
does
the
record
of
the
growth
of
the
various
sciences
afford
instruction
in
those
concrete
ways
of
inquiry
and
testing
which
have
led
men
astray
and
which
have
proved
efficacious
each
science
from
mathematics
to
history
exhibits
typical
fallacious
methods
and
typical
efficacious
methods
in
special
logical
theory
has
thus
a
large
almost
inexhaustible
field
of
empirical
study
the
conventional
statement
that
experience
only
tells
us
how
men
have
thought
or
think
while
logic
is
concerned
with
norms
with
how
men
think
is
ludicrously
inept
some
sorts
of
thinking
are
shown
experience
to
have
got
nowhere
or
worse
than
nowhere
into
systematized
delusion
and
mistake
others
have
proved
in
manifest
experience
that
they
lead
to
fruitful
and
enduring
discoveries
it
is
precisely
in
experience
that
the
different
consequences
of
different
methods
of
investigation
and
ratiocination
are
convincingly
shown
the
repetition
of
the
distinction
between
an
empirical
description
of
what
is
and
a
normative
account
of
what
should
be
merely
neglects
the
most
striking
fact
about
thinking
as
it
empirically
is
namely
its
flagrant
exhibition
of
cases
of
failure
and
success
that
is
of
good
thinking
and
bad
thinking
any
one
who
considers
this
empirical
manifestation
will
not
complain
of
lack
of
material
from
which
to
construct
a
art
the
more
study
that
is
given
to
empirical
records
of
actual
thought
the
more
apparent
becomes
the
connection
between
the
specific
features
of
thinking
which
have
produced
failure
and
success
out
of
this
relationship
of
cause
and
effect
as
it
is
empirically
ascertained
grow
the
norms
and
regulations
of
an
art
of
thinking
mathematics
is
often
cited
as
an
example
of
purely
normative
thinking
dependent
upon
canons
and
material
but
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
student
who
approaches
the
matter
historically
can
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
status
of
mathematics
is
as
empirical
as
that
of
metallurgy
men
began
with
counting
and
measuring
things
just
as
they
began
with
pounding
and
burning
them
one
thing
as
common
speech
profoundly
has
it
led
to
another
certain
ways
were
successful
not
merely
in
the
immediately
practical
sense
but
in
the
sense
of
being
interesting
of
arousing
attention
of
exciting
attempts
at
improvement
the
mathematical
logician
may
present
the
structure
of
mathematics
as
if
it
had
sprung
all
at
once
from
the
brain
of
a
zeus
whose
anatomy
is
that
of
pure
logic
but
nevertheless
this
very
structure
is
a
product
of
long
historic
growth
in
which
all
kinds
of
experiments
have
been
tried
in
which
some
men
have
struck
out
in
this
direction
and
some
in
that
and
in
which
some
exercises
and
operations
have
resulted
in
confusion
and
others
in
triumphant
clarifications
and
fruitful
growths
a
history
in
which
matter
and
methods
have
been
constantly
selected
and
worked
over
on
the
basis
of
empirical
success
and
failure
the
structure
of
alleged
normative
mathematics
is
in
truth
the
crowned
result
of
ages
of
toilsome
experience
the
metallurgist
who
should
write
on
the
most
highly
developed
method
of
dealing
with
ores
would
not
in
truth
proceed
any
differently
he
too
selects
refines
and
organizes
the
methods
which
in
the
past
have
been
found
to
yield
the
maximum
of
achievement
logic
is
a
matter
of
profound
human
importance
precisely
because
it
is
empirically
founded
and
experimentally
applied
so
considered
the
problem
of
logical
theory
is
none
other
than
the
problem
of
the
possibility
of
the
development
and
employment
of
intelligent
method
in
inquiries
concerned
with
deliberate
reconstruction
of
experience
and
it
is
only
saying
again
in
more
specific
form
what
has
been
said
in
general
form
to
add
that
while
such
a
logic
has
been
developed
in
respect
to
mathematics
and
physical
science
intelligent
method
logic
is
still
far
to
seek
in
moral
and
political
affairs
assuming
accordingly
this
idea
of
logic
without
argument
let
us
proceed
to
discuss
some
of
its
chief
features
first
light
is
thrown
by
the
of
thinking
upon
a
logic
which
shall
be
a
method
of
intelligent
guidance
of
experience
in
line
with
what
has
already
been
said
about
experience
being
a
matter
primarily
of
behavior
a
matter
is
the
fact
that
thinking
takes
its
departure
from
specific
conflicts
in
experience
that
occasion
perplexity
and
trouble
men
do
not
in
their
natural
estate
think
when
they
have
no
troubles
to
cope
with
no
difficulties
to
overcome
a
life
of
ease
of
success
without
effort
would
be
a
thoughtless
life
and
so
also
would
a
life
of
ready
omnipotence
beings
who
think
are
beings
whose
life
is
so
hemmed
in
and
constricted
that
they
can
not
directly
carry
through
a
course
of
action
to
victorious
consummation
men
also
do
not
tend
to
think
when
their
action
when
they
are
amid
difficulties
is
dictated
to
them
by
authority
soldiers
have
difficulties
and
restrictions
in
plenty
but
as
aristotle
would
say
they
are
not
notorious
for
being
thinkers
thinking
is
done
for
them
higher
up
the
same
is
too
true
of
most
workingmen
under
present
economic
conditions
difficulties
occasion
thinking
only
when
thinking
is
the
imperative
or
urgent
way
out
only
when
it
is
the
indicated
road
to
a
solution
wherever
external
authority
reigns
thinking
is
suspected
and
obnoxious
thinking
however
is
not
the
only
way
in
which
a
personal
solution
of
difficulties
is
sought
as
we
have
seen
dreams
reveries
emotional
idealizations
are
roads
which
are
taken
to
escape
the
strain
of
perplexity
and
conflict
according
to
modern
psychology
many
systematized
delusions
and
mental
disorders
probably
hysteria
itself
originate
as
devices
for
getting
freedom
from
troublesome
conflicting
factors
such
considerations
throw
into
relief
some
of
the
traits
essential
to
thinking
as
a
way
of
responding
to
difficulty
the
solutions
alluded
to
do
not
get
rid
of
the
conflict
and
problems
they
only
get
rid
of
the
feeling
of
it
they
cover
up
consciousness
of
it
because
the
conflict
remains
in
fact
and
is
evaded
in
thought
disorders
arise
the
first
distinguishing
characteristic
of
thinking
then
is
facing
the
facts
inquiry
minute
and
extensive
scrutinizing
observation
nothing
has
done
greater
harm
to
the
successful
conduct
of
the
enterprise
of
thinking
and
to
the
logics
which
reflect
and
formulate
the
undertaking
than
the
habit
of
treating
observation
as
something
outside
of
and
prior
to
thinking
and
thinking
as
something
which
can
go
on
in
the
head
without
observation
of
new
facts
as
part
of
itself
every
approximation
to
such
thinking
is
really
an
approach
to
the
method
of
escape
and
just
referred
to
it
substitutes
an
emotionally
agreeable
and
rationally
train
of
meanings
for
inquiry
into
the
features
of
the
situation
which
cause
the
trouble
it
leads
to
that
type
of
idealism
which
has
well
been
termed
intellectual
somnambulism
it
creates
a
class
of
thinkers
who
are
remote
from
practice
and
hence
from
testing
their
thought
by
application
a
socially
superior
and
irresponsible
class
this
is
the
condition
causing
the
tragic
division
of
theory
and
practice
and
leading
to
an
unreasonable
exaltation
of
theory
on
one
side
and
an
unreasonable
contempt
for
it
on
the
other
it
confirms
current
practice
in
its
hard
brutalities
and
dead
routines
just
because
it
has
transferred
thinking
and
theory
to
a
separate
and
nobler
region
thus
has
the
idealist
conspired
with
the
materialist
to
keep
actual
life
impoverished
and
inequitable
the
isolation
of
thinking
from
confrontation
with
facts
encourages
that
kind
of
observation
which
merely
accumulates
brute
facts
which
occupies
itself
laboriously
with
mere
details
but
never
inquires
into
their
meaning
and
consequences
a
safe
occupation
for
it
never
contemplates
any
use
to
be
made
of
the
observed
facts
in
determining
a
plan
for
changing
the
situation
thinking
which
is
a
method
of
reconstructing
experience
treats
observation
of
facts
on
the
other
hand
as
the
indispensable
step
of
defining
the
problem
of
locating
the
trouble
of
forcing
home
a
definite
instead
of
a
merely
vague
emotional
sense
of
what
the
difficulty
is
and
where
it
lies
it
is
not
aimless
random
miscellaneous
but
purposeful
specific
and
limited
by
the
character
of
the
trouble
undergone
the
purpose
is
so
to
clarify
the
disturbed
and
confused
situation
that
reasonable
ways
of
dealing
with
it
may
be
suggested
when
the
scientific
man
appears
to
observe
aimlessly
it
is
merely
that
he
is
so
in
love
with
problems
as
sources
and
guides
of
inquiry
that
he
is
striving
to
turn
up
a
problem
where
none
appears
on
the
surface
he
is
as
we
say
hunting
for
trouble
because
of
the
satisfaction
to
be
had
in
coping
with
it
specific
and
wide
observation
of
concrete
fact
always
then
corresponds
not
only
with
a
sense
of
a
problem
or
difficulty
but
with
some
vague
sense
of
the
of
the
difficulty
that
is
of
what
it
imports
or
signifies
in
subsequent
experience
it
is
a
kind
of
anticipation
or
prediction
of
what
is
coming
we
speak
very
truly
of
trouble
and
in
observing
the
signs
of
what
the
trouble
is
we
are
at
the
same
time
expecting
forecasting
in
short
framing
an
becoming
aware
of
meaning
when
the
trouble
is
not
only
impending
but
completely
actual
and
present
we
are
overwhelmed
we
do
not
think
but
give
way
to
depression
the
kind
of
trouble
that
occasions
thinking
is
that
which
is
incomplete
and
developing
and
where
what
is
found
already
in
existence
can
be
employed
as
a
sign
from
which
to
infer
what
is
likely
to
come
when
we
intelligently
observe
we
are
as
we
say
apprehensive
as
well
as
apprehending
we
are
on
the
alert
for
something
still
to
come
curiosity
inquiry
investigation
are
directed
quite
as
truly
into
what
is
going
to
happen
next
as
into
what
has
happened
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
latter
is
an
interest
in
getting
evidence
indications
symptoms
for
inferring
the
former
observation
is
diagnosis
and
diagnosis
implies
an
interest
in
anticipation
and
preparation
it
makes
ready
in
advance
an
attitude
of
response
so
that
we
shall
not
be
caught
unawares
that
which
is
not
already
in
existence
that
which
is
only
anticipated
and
inferred
can
not
be
observed
it
does
not
have
the
status
of
fact
of
something
given
a
datum
but
of
a
meaning
an
idea
so
far
as
ideas
are
not
fancies
framed
by
emotionalized
memory
for
escape
and
refuge
they
are
precisely
anticipations
of
something
still
to
come
aroused
by
looking
into
the
facts
of
a
developing
situation
the
blacksmith
watches
his
iron
its
color
and
texture
to
get
evidence
of
what
it
is
getting
ready
to
pass
into
the
physician
observes
his
patient
to
detect
symptoms
of
change
in
some
definite
direction
the
scientific
man
keeps
his
attention
upon
his
laboratory
material
to
get
a
clue
as
to
what
happen
under
certain
conditions
the
very
fact
that
observation
is
not
an
end
in
itself
but
a
search
for
evidence
and
signs
shows
that
along
with
observation
goes
inference
anticipatory
forecast
in
short
an
idea
thought
or
conception
in
a
more
technical
context
it
would
be
worth
while
to
see
what
light
this
logical
correspondence
of
observed
fact
and
projected
idea
or
meaning
throws
upon
certain
traditional
philosophical
problems
and
puzzles
including
that
of
subject
and
predicate
in
judgment
object
and
subject
in
knowledge
real
and
ideal
generally
but
at
this
time
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
pointing
out
that
this
view
of
the
correlative
origin
and
function
of
observed
fact
and
projected
idea
in
experience
commits
us
to
some
very
important
consequences
concerning
the
nature
of
ideas
meanings
conceptions
or
whatever
word
may
be
employed
to
denote
the
specifically
function
because
they
are
suggestions
of
something
that
may
happen
or
eventuate
they
are
as
we
saw
in
the
case
of
ideals
generally
platforms
of
response
to
what
is
going
on
the
man
who
detects
that
the
cause
of
his
difficulty
is
an
automobile
bearing
down
upon
him
is
not
guaranteed
safety
he
may
have
made
his
too
late
but
if
his
comes
in
season
he
has
the
basis
for
doing
something
which
will
avert
threatening
disaster
because
he
foresees
an
impending
result
he
may
do
something
that
will
lead
to
the
situation
eventuating
in
some
other
way
all
intelligent
thinking
means
an
increment
of
freedom
in
action
an
emancipation
from
chance
and
fatality
thought
represents
the
suggestion
of
a
way
of
response
that
is
different
from
that
which
would
have
been
followed
if
intelligent
observation
had
not
effected
an
inference
as
to
the
future
now
a
method
of
action
a
mode
of
response
intended
to
produce
a
certain
result
that
is
to
enable
the
blacksmith
to
give
a
certain
form
to
his
hot
iron
the
physician
to
treat
the
patient
so
as
to
facilitate
recovery
the
scientific
experimenter
to
draw
a
conclusion
which
will
apply
to
other
cases
is
by
the
nature
of
the
case
tentative
uncertain
till
tested
by
its
results
the
significance
of
this
fact
for
the
theory
of
truth
will
be
discussed
below
here
it
is
enough
to
note
that
notions
theories
systems
no
matter
how
elaborate
and
they
are
must
be
regarded
as
hypotheses
they
are
to
be
accepted
as
bases
of
actions
which
test
them
not
as
finalities
to
perceive
this
fact
is
to
abolish
rigid
dogmas
from
the
world
it
is
to
recognize
that
conceptions
theories
and
systems
of
thought
are
always
open
to
development
through
use
it
is
to
enforce
the
lesson
that
we
must
be
on
the
lookout
quite
as
much
for
indications
to
alter
them
as
for
opportunities
to
assert
them
they
are
tools
as
in
the
case
of
all
tools
their
value
resides
not
in
themselves
but
in
their
capacity
to
work
shown
in
the
consequences
of
their
use
nevertheless
inquiry
is
free
only
when
the
interest
in
knowing
is
so
developed
that
thinking
carries
with
it
something
worth
while
for
itself
something
having
its
own
esthetic
and
moral
interest
just
because
knowing
is
not
and
final
but
is
instrumental
to
reconstruction
of
situations
there
is
always
danger
that
it
will
be
subordinated
to
maintaining
some
preconceived
purpose
or
prejudice
then
reflection
ceases
to
be
complete
it
falls
short
being
precommitted
to
arriving
at
some
special
result
it
is
not
sincere
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
all
knowing
has
an
end
beyond
itself
and
another
thing
a
thing
of
a
contrary
kind
to
say
that
an
act
of
knowing
has
a
particular
end
which
it
is
bound
in
advance
to
reach
much
less
is
it
true
that
the
instrumental
nature
of
thinking
means
that
it
exists
for
the
sake
of
attaining
some
private
advantage
upon
which
one
has
set
heart
any
limitation
whatever
of
the
end
means
limitation
in
the
thinking
process
itself
it
signifies
that
it
does
not
attain
its
full
growth
and
movement
but
is
cramped
impeded
interfered
with
the
only
situation
in
which
knowing
is
fully
stimulated
is
one
in
which
the
end
is
developed
in
the
process
of
inquiry
and
testing
disinterested
and
impartial
inquiry
is
then
far
from
meaning
that
knowing
is
and
irresponsible
it
means
that
there
is
no
particular
end
set
up
in
advance
so
as
to
shut
in
the
activities
of
observation
forming
of
ideas
and
application
inquiry
is
emancipated
it
is
encouraged
to
attend
to
every
fact
that
is
relevant
to
defining
the
problem
or
need
and
to
follow
up
every
suggestion
that
promises
a
clue
the
barriers
to
free
inquiry
are
so
many
and
so
solid
that
mankind
is
to
be
congratulated
that
the
very
act
of
investigation
is
capable
of
itself
becoming
a
delightful
and
absorbing
pursuit
capable
of
enlisting
on
its
side
man
sporting
instincts
just
in
the
degree
in
which
thought
ceases
to
be
held
down
to
ends
fixed
by
social
custom
a
social
division
of
labor
grows
up
investigation
has
become
a
dominant
life
occupation
for
some
persons
only
superficially
however
does
this
confirm
the
idea
that
theory
and
knowledge
are
ends
in
themselves
they
are
relatively
speaking
ends
in
themselves
for
some
persons
but
these
persons
represent
a
social
division
of
labor
and
their
specialization
can
be
trusted
only
when
such
persons
are
in
unobstructed
with
other
social
occupations
sensitive
to
others
problems
and
transmitting
results
to
them
for
wider
application
in
action
when
this
social
relationship
of
persons
particularly
engaged
in
carrying
on
the
enterprise
of
knowing
is
forgotten
and
the
class
becomes
isolated
inquiry
loses
stimulus
and
purpose
it
degenerates
into
sterile
specialization
a
kind
of
intellectual
busy
work
carried
on
by
socially
men
details
are
heaped
up
in
the
name
of
science
and
abstruse
dialectical
developments
of
systems
occur
then
the
occupation
is
rationalized
under
the
lofty
name
of
devotion
to
truth
for
its
own
sake
but
when
the
path
of
true
science
is
retaken
these
things
are
brushed
aside
and
forgotten
they
turn
out
to
have
been
the
toyings
of
vain
and
irresponsible
men
the
only
guarantee
of
impartial
disinterested
inquiry
is
the
social
sensitiveness
of
the
inquirer
to
the
needs
and
problems
of
those
with
whom
he
is
associated
as
the
instrumental
theory
is
favorable
to
high
esteem
for
impartial
and
disinterested
inquiry
so
contrary
to
the
impressions
of
some
critics
it
sets
much
store
upon
the
apparatus
of
deduction
it
is
a
strange
notion
that
because
one
says
that
the
cognitive
value
of
conceptions
definitions
generalizations
classifications
and
the
development
of
consecutive
implications
is
not
that
therefore
one
makes
light
of
the
deductive
function
or
denies
its
fruitfulness
and
necessity
the
instrumental
theory
only
attempts
to
state
with
some
scrupulousness
the
value
is
found
and
to
prevent
its
being
sought
in
the
wrong
place
it
says
that
knowing
begins
with
specific
observations
that
define
the
problem
and
ends
with
specific
observations
that
test
a
hypothesis
for
its
solution
but
that
the
idea
the
meaning
which
the
original
observations
suggest
and
the
final
ones
test
itself
requires
careful
scrutiny
and
prolonged
development
the
theory
would
be
the
last
to
deny
to
say
that
a
locomotive
is
an
agency
that
it
is
intermediate
between
a
need
in
experience
and
its
satisfaction
is
not
to
depreciate
the
worth
of
careful
and
elaborate
construction
of
the
locomotive
or
the
need
of
subsidiary
tools
and
processes
that
are
devoted
to
introducing
improvements
into
its
structure
one
would
rather
say
that
the
locomotive
is
intermediary
in
experience
not
primary
and
not
final
it
is
impossible
to
devote
too
much
care
to
its
constructive
development
such
a
deductive
science
as
mathematics
represents
the
perfecting
of
method
that
a
method
to
those
concerned
with
it
should
present
itself
as
an
end
on
its
own
account
is
no
more
surprising
than
that
there
should
be
a
distinct
business
for
making
any
tool
rarely
are
those
who
invent
and
perfect
a
tool
those
who
employ
it
there
is
indeed
one
marked
difference
between
the
physical
and
the
intellectual
instrumentality
the
development
of
the
latter
runs
far
beyond
any
immediately
visible
use
the
artistic
interest
in
perfecting
the
method
by
itself
is
strong
as
the
utensils
of
civilization
may
themselves
become
works
of
finest
art
but
from
the
practical
standpoint
this
difference
shows
that
the
advantage
as
an
instrumentality
is
on
the
side
of
the
intellectual
tool
just
because
it
is
not
formed
with
a
special
application
in
mind
because
it
is
a
highly
generalized
tool
it
is
the
more
flexible
in
adaptation
to
unforeseen
uses
it
can
be
employed
in
dealing
with
problems
that
were
not
anticipated
the
mind
is
prepared
in
advance
for
all
sorts
of
intellectual
emergencies
and
when
the
new
problem
occurs
it
does
not
have
to
wait
till
it
can
get
a
special
instrument
ready
more
definitely
abstraction
is
indispensable
if
one
experience
is
to
be
applicable
in
other
experiences
every
concrete
experience
in
its
totality
is
unique
it
is
itself
taken
in
its
full
concreteness
it
yields
no
instruction
it
throws
no
light
what
is
called
abstraction
means
that
some
phase
of
it
is
selected
for
the
sake
of
the
aid
it
gives
in
grasping
something
else
taken
by
itself
it
is
a
mangled
fragment
a
poor
substitute
for
the
living
whole
from
which
it
is
extracted
but
viewed
teleologically
or
practically
it
represents
the
only
way
in
which
one
experience
can
be
made
of
any
value
for
another
the
only
way
in
which
something
enlightening
can
be
secured
what
is
called
false
or
vicious
abstractionism
signifies
that
the
of
the
detached
fragment
is
forgotten
and
neglected
so
that
it
is
esteemed
barely
in
itself
as
something
of
a
higher
order
than
the
muddy
and
irregular
concrete
from
which
it
was
wrenched
looked
at
functionally
not
structurally
and
statically
abstraction
means
that
something
has
been
released
from
one
experience
for
transfer
to
another
abstraction
is
liberation
the
more
theoretical
the
more
abstract
an
abstraction
or
the
farther
away
it
is
from
anything
experienced
in
its
concreteness
the
better
fitted
it
is
to
deal
with
any
one
of
the
indefinite
variety
of
things
that
may
later
present
themselves
ancient
mathematics
and
physics
were
much
nearer
the
gross
concrete
experience
than
are
modern
for
that
very
reason
they
were
more
impotent
in
affording
any
insight
into
and
control
over
such
concretes
as
present
themselves
in
new
and
unexpected
forms
abstraction
and
generalization
have
always
been
recognized
as
close
kin
it
may
be
said
that
they
are
the
negative
and
positive
sides
of
the
same
function
abstraction
sets
free
some
factor
so
that
it
may
be
used
generalization
is
the
use
it
carries
over
and
extends
it
is
always
in
some
sense
a
leap
in
the
dark
it
is
an
adventure
there
can
be
no
assurance
in
advance
that
what
is
extracted
from
one
concrete
can
be
fruitfully
extended
to
another
individual
case
since
these
other
cases
are
individual
and
concrete
they
be
dissimilar
the
trait
of
flying
is
detached
from
the
concrete
bird
this
abstraction
is
then
carried
over
to
the
bat
and
it
is
expected
in
view
of
the
application
of
the
quality
to
have
some
of
the
other
traits
of
the
bird
this
trivial
instance
indicates
the
essence
of
generalization
and
also
illustrates
the
riskiness
of
the
proceeding
it
transfers
extends
applies
a
result
of
some
former
experience
to
the
reception
and
interpretation
of
a
new
one
deductive
processes
define
delimit
purify
and
set
in
order
the
conceptions
through
which
this
enriching
and
directive
operation
is
carried
on
but
they
can
not
however
perfect
guarantee
the
outcome
the
pragmatic
value
of
organization
is
so
conspicuously
enforced
in
contemporary
life
that
it
hardly
seems
necessary
to
dwell
upon
the
instrumental
significance
of
classification
and
systematization
when
the
existence
of
qualitative
and
fixed
species
was
denied
to
be
the
supreme
object
of
knowledge
classification
was
often
regarded
especially
by
the
empirical
school
as
merely
a
linguistic
device
it
was
convenient
for
memory
and
communication
to
have
words
that
sum
up
a
number
of
particulars
classes
were
supposed
to
exist
only
in
speech
later
ideas
were
recognized
as
a
kind
of
between
things
and
words
classes
were
allowed
to
exist
in
the
mind
as
purely
mental
things
the
critical
disposition
of
empiricism
is
well
exemplified
here
to
assign
any
objectivity
to
classes
was
to
encourage
a
belief
in
eternal
species
and
occult
essences
and
to
strengthen
the
arms
of
a
decadent
and
obnoxious
science
a
point
of
view
well
illustrated
in
locke
general
are
useful
in
economizing
effort
enabling
us
to
condense
particular
experiences
into
simpler
and
more
easily
carried
bunches
and
making
it
easier
to
identify
new
observations
so
far
nominalism
and
conceptualism
the
theory
that
kinds
exist
only
in
words
or
in
ideas
was
on
the
right
track
it
emphasized
the
teleological
character
of
systems
and
classifications
that
they
exist
for
the
sake
of
economy
and
efficiency
in
reaching
ends
but
this
truth
was
perverted
into
a
false
notion
because
the
active
and
doing
side
of
experience
was
denied
or
ignored
concrete
things
have
of
acting
as
many
ways
of
acting
as
they
have
points
of
interaction
with
other
things
one
thing
is
callous
unresponsive
inert
in
the
presence
of
some
other
things
it
is
alert
eager
and
on
the
aggressive
with
respect
to
other
things
in
a
third
case
it
is
receptive
docile
now
different
ways
of
behaving
in
spite
of
their
endless
diversity
may
be
classed
together
in
view
of
common
relationship
to
an
end
no
sensible
person
tries
to
do
everything
he
has
certain
main
interests
and
leading
aims
by
which
he
makes
his
behavior
coherent
and
effective
to
have
an
aim
is
to
limit
select
concentrate
group
thus
a
basis
is
furnished
for
selecting
and
organizing
things
according
as
their
ways
of
acting
are
related
to
carrying
forward
pursuit
cherry
trees
will
be
differently
grouped
by
woodworkers
orchardists
artists
scientists
and
to
the
execution
of
different
purposes
different
ways
of
acting
and
reacting
on
the
part
of
trees
are
important
each
classification
may
be
equally
sound
when
the
difference
of
ends
is
borne
in
mind
nevertheless
there
is
a
genuine
objective
standard
for
the
goodness
of
special
classifications
one
will
further
the
cabinetmaker
in
reaching
his
end
while
another
will
hamper
him
one
classification
will
assist
the
botanist
in
carrying
on
fruitfully
his
work
of
inquiry
and
another
will
retard
and
confuse
him
the
teleological
theory
of
classification
does
not
therefore
commit
us
to
the
notion
that
classes
are
purely
verbal
or
purely
mental
organization
is
no
more
merely
nominal
or
mental
in
any
art
including
the
art
of
inquiry
than
it
is
in
a
department
store
or
railway
system
the
necessity
of
execution
supplies
objective
criteria
things
have
to
be
sorted
out
and
arranged
so
that
their
grouping
will
promote
successful
action
for
ends
convenience
economy
and
efficiency
are
the
bases
of
classification
but
these
things
are
not
restricted
to
verbal
communication
with
others
nor
to
inner
consciousness
they
concern
objective
action
they
must
take
effect
in
the
world
at
the
same
time
a
classification
is
not
a
bare
transcript
or
duplicate
of
some
finished
and
arrangement
in
nature
it
is
rather
a
repertory
of
weapons
for
attack
upon
the
future
and
the
unknown
for
success
the
details
of
past
knowledge
must
be
reduced
from
bare
facts
to
meanings
the
fewer
simpler
and
more
extensive
the
better
they
must
be
broad
enough
in
scope
to
prepare
inquiry
to
cope
with
any
phenomenon
however
unexpected
they
must
be
arranged
so
as
not
to
overlap
for
otherwise
when
they
are
applied
to
new
events
they
interfere
and
produce
confusion
in
order
that
there
may
be
ease
and
economy
of
movement
in
dealing
with
the
enormous
diversity
of
occurrences
that
present
themselves
we
must
be
able
to
move
promptly
and
definitely
from
one
tool
of
attack
to
another
in
other
words
our
various
classes
and
kinds
must
be
themselves
classified
in
graded
series
from
the
larger
to
the
more
specific
there
must
not
only
be
streets
but
the
streets
must
be
laid
out
with
reference
to
facilitating
passage
from
any
one
to
any
other
classification
transforms
a
wilderness
of
in
experience
into
a
system
of
roads
promoting
transportation
and
communication
in
inquiry
as
soon
as
men
begin
to
take
foresight
for
the
future
and
to
prepare
themselves
in
advance
to
meet
it
effectively
and
prosperously
the
deductive
operations
and
their
results
gain
in
importance
in
every
practical
enterprise
there
are
goods
to
be
produced
and
whatever
eliminates
wasted
material
and
promotes
economy
and
efficiency
of
production
is
precious
little
time
is
left
to
speak
of
the
account
of
the
nature
of
truth
given
by
the
experimental
and
functional
type
of
logic
this
is
less
to
be
regretted
because
this
account
is
completely
a
corollary
from
the
nature
of
thinking
and
ideas
if
the
view
held
as
to
the
latter
is
understood
the
conception
of
truth
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
if
it
be
not
understood
any
attempt
to
present
the
theory
of
truth
is
bound
to
be
confusing
and
the
theory
itself
to
seem
arbitrary
and
absurd
ideas
meanings
conceptions
notions
theories
systems
are
instrumental
to
an
active
reorganization
of
the
given
environment
to
a
removal
of
some
specific
trouble
and
perplexity
then
the
test
of
their
validity
and
value
lies
in
accomplishing
this
work
if
they
succeed
in
their
office
they
are
reliable
sound
valid
good
true
if
they
fail
to
clear
up
confusion
to
eliminate
defects
if
they
increase
confusion
uncertainty
and
evil
when
they
are
acted
upon
then
are
they
false
confirmation
corroboration
verification
lie
in
works
consequences
handsome
is
that
handsome
does
by
their
fruits
shall
ye
them
that
which
guides
us
truly
is
true
demonstrated
capacity
for
such
guidance
is
precisely
what
is
meant
by
truth
the
adverb
truly
is
more
fundamental
than
either
the
adjective
true
or
the
noun
truth
an
adverb
expresses
a
way
a
mode
of
acting
now
an
idea
or
conception
is
a
claim
or
injunction
or
plan
to
in
a
certain
way
as
the
way
to
arrive
at
the
clearing
up
of
a
specific
situation
when
the
claim
or
pretension
or
plan
is
acted
upon
guides
us
truly
or
it
leads
us
to
our
end
or
away
from
it
its
active
dynamic
function
is
the
thing
about
it
and
in
the
quality
of
activity
induced
by
it
lies
all
its
truth
and
falsity
the
hypothesis
that
works
is
the
one
and
is
an
abstract
noun
applied
to
the
collection
of
cases
actual
foreseen
and
desired
that
receive
confirmation
in
their
works
and
consequences
so
wholly
does
the
worth
of
this
conception
of
truth
depend
upon
the
correctness
of
the
prior
account
of
thinking
that
it
is
more
profitable
to
consider
why
the
conception
gives
offence
than
to
expound
it
on
its
own
account
part
of
the
reason
why
it
has
been
found
so
obnoxious
is
doubtless
its
novelty
and
defects
in
its
statement
too
often
for
example
when
truth
has
been
thought
of
as
satisfaction
it
has
been
thought
of
as
merely
emotional
satisfaction
a
private
comfort
a
meeting
of
purely
personal
need
but
the
satisfaction
in
question
means
a
satisfaction
of
the
needs
and
conditions
of
the
problem
out
of
which
the
idea
the
purpose
and
method
of
action
arises
it
includes
public
and
objective
conditions
it
is
not
to
be
manipulated
by
whim
or
personal
idiosyncrasy
again
when
truth
is
defined
as
utility
it
is
often
thought
to
mean
utility
for
some
purely
personal
end
some
profit
upon
which
a
particular
individual
has
set
his
heart
so
repulsive
is
a
conception
of
truth
which
makes
it
a
mere
tool
of
private
ambition
and
aggrandizement
that
the
wonder
is
that
critics
have
attributed
such
a
notion
to
sane
men
as
matter
of
fact
truth
as
utility
means
service
in
making
just
that
contribution
to
reorganization
in
experience
that
the
idea
or
theory
claims
to
be
able
to
make
the
usefulness
of
a
road
is
not
measured
by
the
degree
in
which
it
lends
itself
to
the
purposes
of
a
highwayman
it
is
measured
by
whether
it
actually
functions
a
road
as
a
means
of
easy
and
effective
public
transportation
and
communication
and
so
with
the
serviceableness
of
an
idea
or
hypothesis
as
a
measure
of
its
truth
turning
from
such
rather
superficial
misunderstandings
we
find
i
think
the
chief
obstacle
to
the
reception
of
this
notion
of
truth
in
an
inheritance
from
the
classic
tradition
that
has
become
so
deeply
engrained
in
men
minds
in
just
the
degree
in
which
existence
is
divided
into
two
realms
a
higher
one
of
perfect
being
and
a
lower
one
of
seeming
phenomenal
deficient
reality
truth
and
falsity
are
thought
of
as
fixed
static
properties
of
things
themselves
supreme
reality
is
true
being
inferior
and
imperfect
reality
is
false
being
it
makes
claims
to
reality
which
it
can
not
substantiate
it
is
deceitful
fraudulent
inherently
unworthy
of
trust
and
belief
beliefs
are
false
not
because
they
mislead
us
they
are
not
mistaken
ways
of
thinking
they
are
false
because
they
admit
and
adhere
to
false
existences
or
subsistences
other
notions
are
true
because
they
do
have
to
do
with
true
being
with
full
and
ultimate
reality
such
a
notion
lies
at
the
back
of
the
head
of
every
one
who
has
in
however
an
indirect
way
been
a
recipient
of
the
ancient
and
medieval
tradition
this
view
is
radically
challenged
by
the
pragmatic
conception
of
truth
and
the
impossibility
of
reconciliation
or
compromise
is
i
think
the
cause
of
the
shock
occasioned
by
the
newer
theory
this
contrast
however
constitutes
the
importance
of
the
new
theory
as
well
as
the
unconscious
obstruction
to
its
acceptance
the
older
conception
worked
out
practically
to
identify
truth
with
authoritative
dogma
a
society
that
chiefly
esteems
order
that
finds
growth
painful
and
change
disturbing
inevitably
seeks
for
a
fixed
body
of
superior
truths
upon
which
it
may
depend
it
looks
backward
to
something
already
in
existence
for
the
source
and
sanction
of
truth
it
falls
back
upon
what
is
antecedent
prior
original
for
assurance
the
thought
of
looking
ahead
toward
the
eventual
toward
consequences
creates
uneasiness
and
fear
it
disturbs
the
sense
of
rest
that
is
attached
to
the
ideas
of
fixed
truth
already
in
existence
it
puts
a
heavy
burden
of
responsibility
upon
us
for
search
unremitting
observation
scrupulous
development
of
hypotheses
and
thoroughgoing
testing
in
physical
matters
men
have
slowly
grown
accustomed
in
all
specific
beliefs
to
identifying
the
true
with
the
verified
but
they
still
hesitate
to
recognize
the
implication
of
this
identification
and
to
derive
the
definition
of
truth
from
it
for
while
it
is
nominally
agreed
upon
as
a
commonplace
that
definitions
ought
to
spring
from
concrete
and
specific
cases
rather
than
be
invented
in
the
empty
air
and
imposed
upon
particulars
there
is
a
strange
unwillingness
to
act
upon
the
maxim
in
defining
truth
to
generalize
the
recognition
that
the
true
means
the
verified
and
means
nothing
else
places
upon
men
the
responsibility
for
surrendering
political
and
moral
dogmas
and
subjecting
to
the
test
of
consequences
their
most
cherished
prejudices
such
a
change
involves
a
great
change
in
the
seat
of
authority
and
the
methods
of
decision
in
society
some
of
them
as
first
fruits
of
the
newer
logic
will
be
considered
in
the
following
lectures
chapter
vii
reconstruction
in
moral
conceptions
the
impact
of
the
alteration
in
methods
of
scientific
thinking
upon
moral
ideas
is
in
general
obvious
goods
ends
are
multiplied
rules
are
softened
into
principles
and
principles
are
modified
into
methods
of
understanding
ethical
theory
began
among
the
greeks
as
an
attempt
to
find
a
regulation
for
the
conduct
of
life
which
should
have
a
rational
basis
and
purpose
instead
of
being
derived
from
custom
but
reason
as
a
substitute
for
custom
was
under
the
obligation
of
supplying
objects
and
laws
as
fixed
as
those
of
custom
had
been
ethical
theory
ever
since
has
been
singularly
hypnotized
by
the
notion
that
its
business
is
to
discover
some
final
end
or
good
or
some
ultimate
and
supreme
law
this
is
the
common
element
among
the
diversity
of
theories
some
have
held
that
the
end
is
loyalty
or
obedience
to
a
higher
power
or
authority
and
they
have
variously
found
this
higher
principle
in
divine
will
the
will
of
the
secular
ruler
the
maintenance
of
institutions
in
which
the
purpose
of
superiors
is
embodied
and
the
rational
consciousness
of
duty
but
they
have
differed
from
one
another
because
there
was
one
point
in
which
they
were
agreed
a
single
and
final
source
of
law
others
have
asserted
that
it
is
impossible
to
locate
morality
in
conformity
to
power
and
that
it
must
be
sought
in
ends
that
are
goods
and
some
have
sought
the
good
in
some
in
holiness
some
in
happiness
some
in
the
greatest
possible
aggregate
of
pleasures
and
yet
these
schools
have
agreed
in
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
single
fixed
and
final
good
they
have
been
able
to
dispute
with
one
another
only
because
of
their
common
premise
the
question
arises
whether
the
way
out
of
the
confusion
and
conflict
is
not
to
go
to
the
root
of
the
matter
by
questioning
this
common
element
is
not
the
belief
in
the
single
final
and
ultimate
whether
conceived
as
good
or
as
authoritative
law
an
intellectual
product
of
that
feudal
organization
which
is
disappearing
historically
and
of
that
belief
in
a
bounded
ordered
cosmos
wherein
rest
is
higher
than
motion
which
has
disappeared
from
natural
science
it
has
been
repeatedly
suggested
that
the
present
limit
of
intellectual
reconstruction
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
has
not
as
yet
been
seriously
applied
in
the
moral
and
social
disciplines
would
not
this
further
application
demand
precisely
that
we
advance
to
a
belief
in
a
plurality
of
changing
moving
individualized
goods
and
ends
and
to
a
belief
that
principles
criteria
laws
are
intellectual
instruments
for
analyzing
individual
or
unique
situations
the
blunt
assertion
that
every
moral
situation
is
a
unique
situation
having
its
own
irreplaceable
good
may
seem
not
merely
blunt
but
preposterous
for
the
established
tradition
teaches
that
it
is
precisely
the
irregularity
of
special
cases
which
makes
necessary
the
guidance
of
conduct
by
universals
and
that
the
essence
of
the
virtuous
disposition
is
willingness
to
subordinate
every
particular
case
to
adjudication
by
a
fixed
principle
it
would
then
follow
that
submission
of
a
generic
end
and
law
to
determination
by
the
concrete
situation
entails
complete
confusion
and
unrestrained
licentiousness
let
us
however
follow
the
pragmatic
rule
and
in
order
to
discover
the
meaning
of
the
idea
ask
for
its
consequences
then
it
surprisingly
turns
out
that
the
primary
significance
of
the
unique
and
morally
ultimate
character
of
the
concrete
situation
is
to
transfer
the
weight
and
burden
of
morality
to
intelligence
it
does
not
destroy
responsibility
it
only
locates
it
a
moral
situation
is
one
in
which
judgment
and
choice
are
required
antecedently
to
overt
action
the
practical
meaning
of
the
situation
that
is
to
say
the
action
needed
to
satisfy
it
is
not
it
has
to
be
searched
for
there
are
conflicting
desires
and
alternative
apparent
goods
what
is
needed
is
to
find
the
right
course
of
action
the
right
good
hence
inquiry
is
exacted
observation
of
the
detailed
makeup
of
the
situation
analysis
into
its
diverse
factors
clarification
of
what
is
obscure
discounting
of
the
more
insistent
and
vivid
traits
tracing
the
consequences
of
the
various
modes
of
action
that
suggest
themselves
regarding
the
decision
reached
as
hypothetical
and
tentative
until
the
anticipated
or
supposed
consequences
which
led
to
its
adoption
have
been
squared
with
actual
consequences
this
inquiry
is
intelligence
our
moral
failures
go
back
to
some
weakness
of
disposition
some
absence
of
sympathy
some
bias
that
makes
us
perform
the
judgment
of
the
concrete
case
carelessly
or
perversely
wide
sympathy
keen
sensitiveness
persistence
in
the
face
of
the
disagreeable
balance
of
interests
enabling
us
to
undertake
the
work
of
analysis
and
decision
intelligently
are
the
distinctively
moral
traits
the
virtues
or
moral
excellencies
it
is
worth
noting
once
more
that
the
underlying
issue
is
after
all
only
the
same
as
that
which
has
been
already
threshed
out
in
physical
inquiry
there
too
it
long
seemed
as
if
rational
assurance
and
demonstration
could
be
attained
only
if
we
began
with
universal
conceptions
and
subsumed
particular
cases
under
them
the
men
who
initiated
the
methods
of
inquiry
that
are
now
everywhere
adopted
were
denounced
in
their
day
and
sincerely
as
subverters
of
truth
and
foes
of
science
if
they
have
won
in
the
end
it
is
because
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
the
method
of
universals
confirmed
prejudices
and
sanctioned
ideas
that
had
gained
currency
irrespective
of
evidence
for
them
while
placing
the
initial
and
final
weight
upon
the
individual
case
stimulated
painstaking
inquiry
into
facts
and
examination
of
principles
in
the
end
loss
of
eternal
truths
was
more
than
compensated
for
in
the
accession
of
quotidian
facts
the
loss
of
the
system
of
superior
and
fixed
definitions
and
kinds
was
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
growing
system
of
hypotheses
and
laws
used
in
classifying
facts
after
all
then
we
are
only
pleading
for
the
adoption
in
moral
reflection
of
the
logic
that
has
been
proved
to
make
for
security
stringency
and
fertility
in
passing
judgments
upon
physical
phenomena
and
the
reason
is
the
same
the
old
method
in
spite
of
its
nominal
and
esthetic
worship
of
reason
discouraged
reason
because
it
hindered
the
operation
of
scrupulous
and
unremitting
inquiry
more
definitely
the
transfer
of
the
burden
of
the
moral
life
from
following
rules
or
pursuing
fixed
ends
over
to
the
detection
of
the
ills
that
need
remedy
in
a
special
case
and
the
formation
of
plans
and
methods
for
dealing
with
them
eliminates
the
causes
which
have
kept
moral
theory
controversial
and
which
have
also
kept
it
remote
from
helpful
contact
with
the
exigencies
of
practice
the
theory
of
fixed
ends
inevitably
leads
thought
into
the
bog
of
disputes
that
can
not
be
settled
if
there
is
one
one
supreme
end
what
is
it
to
consider
this
problem
is
to
place
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
controversies
that
are
as
acute
now
as
they
were
two
thousand
years
ago
suppose
we
take
a
seemingly
more
empirical
view
and
say
that
while
there
is
not
a
single
end
there
also
are
not
as
many
as
there
are
specific
situations
that
require
amelioration
but
there
are
a
number
of
such
natural
goods
as
health
wealth
honor
or
good
name
friendship
esthetic
appreciation
learning
and
such
moral
goods
as
justice
temperance
benevolence
etc
what
or
who
is
to
decide
the
right
of
way
when
these
ends
conflict
with
one
another
as
they
are
sure
to
do
shall
we
resort
to
the
method
that
once
brought
such
disrepute
upon
the
whole
business
of
ethics
casuistry
or
shall
we
have
recourse
to
what
bentham
well
called
the
method
the
arbitrary
preference
of
this
or
that
person
for
this
or
that
end
or
shall
we
be
forced
to
arrange
them
all
in
an
order
of
degrees
from
the
highest
good
down
to
the
least
precious
again
we
find
ourselves
in
the
middle
of
unreconciled
disputes
with
no
indication
of
the
way
out
meantime
the
special
moral
perplexities
where
the
aid
of
intelligence
is
required
go
unenlightened
we
can
not
seek
or
attain
health
wealth
learning
justice
or
kindness
in
general
action
is
always
specific
concrete
individualized
unique
and
consequently
judgments
as
to
acts
to
be
performed
must
be
similarly
specific
to
say
that
a
man
seeks
health
or
justice
is
only
to
say
that
he
seeks
to
live
healthily
or
justly
these
things
like
truth
are
adverbial
they
are
modifiers
of
action
in
special
cases
how
to
live
healthily
or
justly
is
a
matter
which
differs
with
every
person
it
varies
with
his
past
experience
his
opportunities
his
temperamental
and
acquired
weaknesses
and
abilities
not
man
in
general
but
a
particular
man
suffering
from
some
particular
disability
aims
to
live
healthily
and
consequently
health
can
not
mean
for
him
exactly
what
it
means
for
any
other
mortal
healthy
living
is
not
something
to
be
attained
by
itself
apart
from
other
ways
of
living
a
man
needs
to
be
healthy
his
life
not
apart
from
it
and
what
does
life
mean
except
the
aggregate
of
his
pursuits
and
activities
a
man
who
aims
at
health
as
a
distinct
end
becomes
a
valetudinarian
or
a
fanatic
or
a
mechanical
performer
of
exercises
or
an
athlete
so
that
his
pursuit
of
bodily
development
injures
his
heart
when
the
endeavor
to
realize
a
end
does
not
temper
and
color
all
other
activities
life
is
portioned
out
into
strips
and
fractions
certain
acts
and
times
are
devoted
to
getting
health
others
to
cultivating
religion
others
to
seeking
learning
to
being
a
good
citizen
a
devotee
of
fine
art
and
so
on
this
is
the
only
logical
alternative
to
subordinating
all
aims
to
the
accomplishment
of
one
alone
fanaticism
this
is
out
of
fashion
at
present
but
who
can
say
how
much
of
distraction
and
dissipation
in
life
and
how
much
of
its
hard
and
narrow
rigidity
is
the
outcome
of
men
failure
to
realize
that
each
situation
has
its
own
unique
end
and
that
the
whole
personality
should
be
concerned
with
it
surely
once
more
what
a
man
needs
is
to
live
healthily
and
this
result
so
affects
all
the
activities
of
his
life
that
it
can
not
be
set
up
as
a
separate
and
independent
good
nevertheless
the
general
notions
of
health
disease
justice
artistic
culture
are
of
great
importance
not
however
because
this
or
that
case
may
be
brought
exhaustively
under
a
single
head
and
its
specific
traits
shut
out
but
because
generalized
science
provides
a
man
as
physician
and
artist
and
citizen
with
questions
to
ask
investigations
to
make
and
enables
him
to
understand
the
meaning
of
what
he
sees
just
in
the
degree
in
which
a
physician
is
an
artist
in
his
work
he
uses
his
science
no
matter
how
extensive
and
accurate
to
furnish
him
with
tools
of
inquiry
into
the
individual
case
and
with
methods
of
forecasting
a
method
of
dealing
with
it
just
in
the
degree
in
which
no
matter
how
great
his
learning
he
subordinates
the
individual
case
to
some
classification
of
diseases
and
some
generic
rule
of
treatment
he
sinks
to
the
level
of
the
routine
mechanic
his
intelligence
and
his
action
become
rigid
dogmatic
instead
of
free
and
flexible
goods
and
ends
exist
only
when
something
has
to
be
done
the
fact
that
something
has
to
be
done
proves
that
there
are
deficiencies
evils
in
the
existent
situation
this
ill
is
just
the
specific
ill
that
it
is
it
never
is
an
exact
duplicate
of
anything
else
consequently
the
good
of
the
situation
has
to
be
discovered
projected
and
attained
on
the
basis
of
the
exact
defect
and
trouble
to
be
rectified
it
can
not
intelligently
be
injected
into
the
situation
from
without
yet
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
to
compare
different
cases
to
gather
together
the
ills
from
which
humanity
suffers
and
to
generalize
the
corresponding
goods
into
classes
health
wealth
industry
temperance
amiability
courtesy
learning
esthetic
capacity
initiative
courage
patience
enterprise
thoroughness
and
a
multitude
of
other
generalized
ends
are
acknowledged
as
goods
but
the
of
this
systematization
is
intellectual
or
analytic
classifications
possible
traits
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
in
studying
a
particular
case
they
suggest
methods
of
action
to
be
tried
in
removing
the
inferred
causes
of
ill
they
are
tools
of
insight
their
value
is
in
promoting
an
individualized
response
in
the
individual
situation
morals
is
not
a
catalogue
of
acts
nor
a
set
of
rules
to
be
applied
like
drugstore
prescriptions
or
recipes
the
need
in
morals
is
for
specific
methods
of
inquiry
and
of
contrivance
methods
of
inquiry
to
locate
difficulties
and
evils
methods
of
contrivance
to
form
plans
to
be
used
as
working
hypotheses
in
dealing
with
them
and
the
pragmatic
import
of
the
logic
of
individualized
situations
each
having
its
own
irreplaceable
good
and
principle
is
to
transfer
the
attention
of
theory
from
preoccupation
with
general
conceptions
to
the
problem
of
developing
effective
methods
of
inquiry
two
ethical
consequences
of
great
moment
should
be
remarked
the
belief
in
fixed
values
has
bred
a
division
of
ends
into
intrinsic
and
instrumental
of
those
that
are
really
worth
while
in
themselves
and
those
that
are
of
importance
only
as
means
to
intrinsic
goods
indeed
it
is
often
thought
to
be
the
very
beginning
of
wisdom
of
moral
discrimination
to
make
this
distinction
dialectically
the
distinction
is
interesting
and
seems
harmless
but
carried
into
practice
it
has
an
import
that
is
tragic
historically
it
has
been
the
source
and
justification
of
a
hard
and
fast
difference
between
ideal
goods
on
one
side
and
material
goods
on
the
other
at
present
those
who
would
be
liberal
conceive
intrinsic
goods
as
esthetic
in
nature
rather
than
as
exclusively
religious
or
as
intellectually
contemplative
but
the
effect
is
the
same
intrinsic
goods
whether
religious
or
esthetic
are
divorced
from
those
interests
of
daily
life
which
because
of
their
constancy
and
urgency
form
the
preoccupation
of
the
great
mass
aristotle
used
this
distinction
to
declare
that
slaves
and
the
working
class
though
they
are
necessary
the
state
the
commonweal
are
not
constituents
it
that
which
is
regarded
as
instrumental
must
approach
drudgery
it
can
not
command
either
intellectual
artistic
or
moral
attention
and
respect
anything
becomes
whenever
it
is
thought
of
as
intrinsically
lacking
worth
so
men
of
ideal
interests
have
chosen
for
the
most
part
the
way
of
neglect
and
escape
the
urgency
and
pressure
of
lower
ends
have
been
covered
up
by
polite
conventions
or
they
have
been
relegated
to
a
baser
class
of
mortals
in
order
that
the
few
might
be
free
to
attend
to
the
goods
that
are
really
or
intrinsically
worth
while
this
withdrawal
in
the
name
of
higher
ends
has
left
for
mankind
at
large
and
especially
for
energetic
practical
people
the
lower
activities
in
complete
command
no
one
can
possibly
estimate
how
much
of
the
obnoxious
materialism
and
brutality
of
our
economic
life
is
due
to
the
fact
that
economic
ends
have
been
regarded
as
instrumental
when
they
are
recognized
to
be
as
intrinsic
and
final
in
their
place
as
any
others
then
it
will
be
seen
that
they
are
capable
of
idealization
and
that
if
life
is
to
be
worth
while
they
must
acquire
ideal
and
intrinsic
value
esthetic
religious
and
other
ideal
ends
are
now
thin
and
meagre
or
else
idle
and
luxurious
because
of
the
separation
from
instrumental
or
economic
ends
only
in
connection
with
the
latter
can
they
be
woven
into
the
texture
of
daily
life
and
made
substantial
and
pervasive
the
vanity
and
irresponsibility
of
values
that
are
merely
final
and
not
also
in
turn
means
to
the
enrichment
of
other
occupations
of
life
ought
to
be
obvious
but
now
the
doctrine
of
higher
ends
gives
aid
comfort
and
support
to
every
socially
isolated
and
socially
irresponsible
scholar
specialist
esthete
and
religionist
it
protects
the
vanity
and
irresponsibility
of
his
calling
from
observation
by
others
and
by
himself
the
moral
deficiency
of
the
calling
is
transformed
into
a
cause
of
admiration
and
gratulation
the
other
generic
change
lies
in
doing
away
once
for
all
with
the
traditional
distinction
between
moral
goods
like
the
virtues
and
natural
goods
like
health
economic
security
art
science
and
the
like
the
point
of
view
under
discussion
is
not
the
only
one
which
has
deplored
this
rigid
distinction
and
endeavored
to
abolish
it
some
schools
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
regard
moral
excellencies
qualities
of
character
as
of
value
only
because
they
promote
natural
goods
but
the
experimental
logic
when
carried
into
morals
makes
every
quality
that
is
judged
to
be
good
according
as
it
contributes
to
amelioration
of
existing
ills
and
in
so
doing
it
enforces
the
moral
meaning
of
natural
science
when
all
is
said
and
done
in
criticism
of
present
social
deficiencies
one
may
well
wonder
whether
the
root
difficulty
does
not
lie
in
the
separation
of
natural
and
moral
science
when
physics
chemistry
biology
medicine
contribute
to
the
detection
of
concrete
human
woes
and
to
the
development
of
plans
for
remedying
them
and
relieving
the
human
estate
they
become
moral
they
become
part
of
the
apparatus
of
moral
inquiry
or
science
the
latter
then
loses
its
peculiar
flavor
of
the
didactic
and
pedantic
its
and
hortatory
tone
it
loses
its
thinness
and
shrillness
as
well
as
its
vagueness
it
gains
agencies
that
are
efficacious
but
the
gain
is
not
confined
to
the
side
of
moral
science
natural
science
loses
its
divorce
from
humanity
it
becomes
itself
humanistic
in
quality
it
is
something
to
be
pursued
not
in
a
technical
and
specialized
way
for
what
is
called
truth
for
its
own
sake
but
with
the
sense
of
its
social
bearing
its
intellectual
indispensableness
it
is
technical
only
in
the
sense
that
it
provides
the
technique
of
social
and
moral
engineering
when
the
consciousness
of
science
is
fully
impregnated
with
the
consciousness
of
human
value
the
greatest
dualism
which
now
weighs
humanity
down
the
split
between
the
material
the
mechanical
the
scientific
and
the
moral
and
ideal
will
be
destroyed
human
forces
that
now
waver
because
of
this
division
will
be
unified
and
reinforced
as
long
as
ends
are
not
thought
of
as
individualized
according
to
specific
needs
and
opportunities
the
mind
will
be
content
with
abstractions
and
the
adequate
stimulus
to
the
moral
or
social
use
of
natural
science
and
historical
data
will
be
lacking
but
when
attention
is
concentrated
upon
the
diversified
concretes
recourse
to
all
intellectual
materials
needed
to
clear
up
the
special
cases
will
be
imperative
at
the
same
time
that
morals
are
made
to
focus
in
intelligence
things
intellectual
are
moralized
the
vexatious
and
wasteful
conflict
between
naturalism
and
humanism
is
terminated
these
general
considerations
may
be
amplified
first
inquiry
discovery
take
the
same
place
in
morals
that
they
have
come
to
occupy
in
sciences
of
nature
validation
demonstration
become
experimental
a
matter
of
consequences
reason
always
an
honorific
term
in
ethics
becomes
actualized
in
the
methods
by
which
the
needs
and
conditions
the
obstacles
and
resources
of
situations
are
scrutinized
in
detail
and
intelligent
plans
of
improvement
are
worked
out
remote
and
abstract
generalities
promote
jumping
at
conclusions
anticipations
of
nature
bad
consequences
are
then
deplored
as
due
to
natural
perversity
and
untoward
fate
but
shifting
the
issue
to
analysis
of
a
specific
situation
makes
inquiry
obligatory
and
alert
observation
of
consequences
imperative
no
past
decision
nor
old
principle
can
ever
be
wholly
relied
upon
to
justify
a
course
of
action
no
amount
of
pains
taken
in
forming
a
purpose
in
a
definite
case
is
final
the
consequences
of
its
adoption
must
be
carefully
noted
and
a
purpose
held
only
as
a
working
hypothesis
until
results
confirm
its
rightness
mistakes
are
no
longer
either
mere
unavoidable
accidents
to
be
mourned
or
moral
sins
to
be
expiated
and
forgiven
they
are
lessons
in
wrong
methods
of
using
intelligence
and
instructions
as
to
a
better
course
in
the
future
they
are
indications
of
the
need
of
revision
development
readjustment
ends
grow
standards
of
judgment
are
improved
man
is
under
just
as
much
obligation
to
develop
his
most
advanced
standards
and
ideals
as
to
use
conscientiously
those
which
he
already
possesses
moral
life
is
protected
from
falling
into
formalism
and
rigid
repetition
it
is
rendered
flexible
vital
growing
in
the
second
place
every
case
where
moral
action
is
required
becomes
of
equal
moral
importance
and
urgency
with
every
other
if
the
need
and
deficiencies
of
a
specific
situation
indicate
improvement
of
health
as
the
end
and
good
then
for
that
situation
health
is
the
ultimate
and
supreme
good
it
is
no
means
to
something
else
it
is
a
final
and
intrinsic
value
the
same
thing
is
true
of
improvement
of
economic
status
of
making
a
living
of
attending
to
business
and
family
demands
all
of
the
things
which
under
the
sanction
of
fixed
ends
have
been
rendered
of
secondary
and
merely
instrumental
value
and
so
relatively
base
and
unimportant
anything
that
in
a
given
situation
is
an
end
and
good
at
all
is
of
equal
worth
rank
and
dignity
with
every
other
good
of
any
other
situation
and
deserves
the
same
intelligent
attention
we
note
thirdly
the
effect
in
destroying
the
roots
of
phariseeism
we
are
so
accustomed
to
thinking
of
this
as
deliberate
hypocrisy
that
we
overlook
its
intellectual
premises
the
conception
which
looks
for
the
end
of
action
within
the
circumstances
of
the
actual
situation
will
not
have
the
same
measure
of
judgment
for
all
cases
when
one
factor
of
the
situation
is
a
person
of
trained
mind
and
large
resources
more
will
be
expected
than
with
a
person
of
backward
mind
and
uncultured
experience
the
absurdity
of
applying
the
same
standard
of
moral
judgment
to
savage
peoples
that
is
used
with
civilized
will
be
apparent
no
individual
or
group
will
be
judged
by
whether
they
come
up
to
or
fall
short
of
some
fixed
result
but
by
the
direction
in
which
they
are
moving
the
bad
man
is
the
man
who
no
matter
how
good
he
been
is
beginning
to
deteriorate
to
grow
less
good
the
good
man
is
the
man
who
no
matter
how
morally
unworthy
he
been
is
moving
to
become
better
such
a
conception
makes
one
severe
in
judging
himself
and
humane
in
judging
others
it
excludes
that
arrogance
which
always
accompanies
judgment
based
on
degree
of
approximation
to
fixed
ends
in
the
fourth
place
the
process
of
growth
of
improvement
and
progress
rather
than
the
static
outcome
and
result
becomes
the
significant
thing
not
health
as
an
end
fixed
once
and
for
all
but
the
needed
improvement
in
health
a
continual
process
is
the
end
and
good
the
end
is
no
longer
a
terminus
or
limit
to
be
reached
it
is
the
active
process
of
transforming
the
existent
situation
not
perfection
as
a
final
goal
but
the
process
of
perfecting
maturing
refining
is
the
aim
in
living
honesty
industry
temperance
justice
like
health
wealth
and
learning
are
not
goods
to
be
possessed
as
they
would
be
if
they
expressed
fixed
ends
to
be
attained
they
are
directions
of
change
in
the
quality
of
experience
growth
itself
is
the
only
moral
end
although
the
bearing
of
this
idea
upon
the
problem
of
evil
and
the
controversy
between
optimism
and
pessimism
is
too
vast
to
be
here
discussed
it
may
be
worth
while
to
touch
upon
it
superficially
the
problem
of
evil
ceases
to
be
a
theological
and
metaphysical
one
and
is
perceived
to
be
the
practical
problem
of
reducing
alleviating
as
far
as
may
be
removing
the
evils
of
life
philosophy
is
no
longer
under
obligation
to
find
ingenious
methods
for
proving
that
evils
are
only
apparent
not
real
or
to
elaborate
schemes
for
explaining
them
away
or
worse
yet
for
justifying
them
it
assumes
another
obligation
that
of
contributing
in
however
humble
a
way
to
methods
that
will
assist
us
in
discovering
the

pessimism
is
a
paralyzing
doctrine
in
declaring
that
the
world
is
evil
wholesale
it
makes
futile
all
efforts
to
discover
the
remediable
causes
of
specific
evils
and
thereby
destroys
at
the
root
every
attempt
to
make
the
world
better
and
happier
wholesale
optimism
which
has
been
the
consequence
of
the
attempt
to
explain
evil
away
is
however
equally
an
incubus
after
all
the
optimism
that
says
that
the
world
is
already
the
best
possible
of
all
worlds
might
be
regarded
as
the
most
cynical
of
pessimisms
if
this
is
the
best
possible
what
would
a
world
which
was
fundamentally
bad
be
like
meliorism
is
the
belief
that
the
specific
conditions
which
exist
at
one
moment
be
they
comparatively
bad
or
comparatively
good
in
any
event
may
be
bettered
it
encourages
intelligence
to
study
the
positive
means
of
good
and
the
obstructions
to
their
realization
and
to
put
forth
endeavor
for
the
improvement
of
conditions
it
arouses
confidence
and
a
reasonable
hopefulness
as
optimism
does
not
for
the
latter
in
declaring
that
good
is
already
realized
in
ultimate
reality
tends
to
make
us
gloss
over
the
evils
that
concretely
exist
it
becomes
too
readily
the
creed
of
those
who
live
at
ease
in
comfort
of
those
who
have
been
successful
in
obtaining
this
world
rewards
too
readily
optimism
makes
the
men
who
hold
it
callous
and
blind
to
the
sufferings
of
the
less
fortunate
or
ready
to
find
the
cause
of
troubles
of
others
in
their
personal
viciousness
it
thus
with
pessimism
in
spite
of
the
extreme
nominal
differences
between
the
two
in
benumbing
sympathetic
insight
and
intelligent
effort
in
reform
it
beckons
men
away
from
the
world
of
relativity
and
change
into
the
calm
of
the
absolute
and
eternal
the
import
of
many
of
these
changes
in
moral
attitude
focusses
in
the
idea
of
happiness
happiness
has
often
been
made
the
object
of
the
moralists
contempt
yet
the
most
ascetic
moralist
has
usually
restored
the
idea
of
happiness
under
some
other
name
such
as
bliss
goodness
without
happiness
valor
and
virtue
without
satisfaction
ends
without
conscious
enjoyment
these
things
are
as
intolerable
practically
as
they
are
in
conception
happiness
is
not
however
a
bare
possession
it
is
not
a
fixed
attainment
such
a
happiness
is
either
the
unworthy
selfishness
which
moralists
have
so
bitterly
condemned
or
it
is
even
if
labelled
bliss
an
insipid
tedium
a
millennium
of
ease
in
relief
from
all
struggle
and
labor
it
could
satisfy
only
the
most
delicate
of
happiness
is
found
only
in
success
but
success
means
succeeding
getting
forward
moving
in
advance
it
is
an
active
process
not
a
passive
outcome
accordingly
it
includes
the
overcoming
of
obstacles
the
elimination
of
sources
of
defect
and
esthetic
sensitiveness
and
enjoyment
are
a
large
constituent
in
any
worthy
happiness
but
the
esthetic
appreciation
which
is
totally
separated
from
renewal
of
spirit
from
of
mind
and
purification
of
emotion
is
a
weak
and
sickly
thing
destined
to
speedy
death
from
starvation
that
the
renewal
and
come
unconsciously
not
by
set
intention
but
makes
them
the
more
genuine
upon
the
whole
utilitarianism
has
marked
the
best
in
the
transition
from
the
classic
theory
of
ends
and
goods
to
that
which
is
now
possible
it
had
definite
merits
it
insisted
upon
getting
away
from
vague
generalities
and
down
to
the
specific
and
concrete
it
subordinated
law
to
human
achievement
instead
of
subordinating
humanity
to
external
law
it
taught
that
institutions
are
made
for
man
and
not
man
for
institutions
it
actively
promoted
all
issues
of
reform
it
made
moral
good
natural
humane
in
touch
with
the
natural
goods
of
life
it
opposed
unearthly
and
other
worldly
morality
above
all
it
acclimatized
in
human
imagination
the
idea
of
social
welfare
as
a
supreme
test
but
it
was
still
profoundly
affected
in
fundamental
points
by
old
ways
of
thinking
it
never
questioned
the
idea
of
a
fixed
final
and
supreme
end
it
only
questioned
the
current
notions
as
to
the
nature
of
this
end
and
then
inserted
pleasure
and
the
greatest
possible
aggregate
of
pleasures
in
the
position
of
the
fixed
end
such
a
point
of
view
treats
concrete
activities
and
specific
interests
not
as
worth
while
in
themselves
or
as
constituents
of
happiness
but
as
mere
external
means
to
getting
pleasures
the
upholders
of
the
old
tradition
could
therefore
easily
accuse
utilitarianism
of
making
not
only
virtue
but
art
poetry
religion
and
the
state
into
mere
servile
means
of
attaining
sensuous
enjoyments
since
pleasure
was
an
outcome
a
result
valuable
on
its
own
account
independently
of
the
active
processes
that
achieve
it
happiness
was
a
thing
to
be
possessed
and
held
onto
the
acquisitive
instincts
of
man
were
exaggerated
at
the
expense
of
the
creative
production
was
of
importance
not
because
of
the
intrinsic
worth
of
invention
and
reshaping
the
world
but
because
its
external
results
feed
pleasure
like
every
theory
that
sets
up
fixed
and
final
aims
in
making
the
end
passive
and
possessive
it
made
all
active
operations
tools
labor
was
an
unavoidable
evil
to
be
minimized
security
in
possession
was
the
chief
thing
practically
material
comfort
and
ease
were
magnified
in
contrast
with
the
pains
and
risk
of
experimental
creation
these
deficiencies
under
certain
conceivable
conditions
might
have
remained
merely
theoretical
but
the
disposition
of
the
times
and
the
interests
of
those
who
propagated
the
utilitarian
ideas
endowed
them
with
power
for
social
harm
in
spite
of
the
power
of
the
new
ideas
in
attacking
old
social
abuses
there
were
elements
in
the
teaching
which
operated
or
protected
to
sanction
new
social
abuses
the
reforming
zeal
was
shown
in
criticism
of
the
evils
inherited
from
the
class
system
of
feudalism
evils
economic
legal
and
political
but
the
new
economic
order
of
capitalism
that
was
superseding
feudalism
brought
its
own
social
evils
with
it
and
some
of
these
ills
utilitarianism
tended
to
cover
up
or
defend
the
emphasis
upon
acquisition
and
possession
of
enjoyments
took
on
an
untoward
color
in
connection
with
the
contemporary
enormous
desire
for
wealth
and
the
enjoyments
it
makes
possible
if
utilitarianism
did
not
actively
promote
the
new
economic
materialism
it
had
no
means
of
combating
it
its
general
spirit
of
subordinating
productive
activity
to
the
bare
product
was
indirectly
favorable
to
the
cause
of
an
unadorned
commercialism
in
spite
of
its
interest
in
a
thoroughly
social
aim
utilitarianism
fostered
a
new
class
interest
that
of
the
capitalistic
interests
provided
only
property
was
obtained
through
free
competition
and
not
by
governmental
favor
the
stress
that
bentham
put
on
security
tended
to
consecrate
the
legal
institution
of
private
property
provided
only
certain
legal
abuses
in
connection
with
its
acquisition
and
transfer
were
abolished
provided
possessions
had
been
obtained
in
accord
with
the
rules
of
the
competitive
game
without
that
is
extraneous
favors
from
government
thus
utilitarianism
gave
intellectual
confirmation
to
all
those
tendencies
which
make
business
not
a
means
of
social
service
and
an
opportunity
for
personal
growth
in
creative
power
but
a
way
of
accumulating
the
means
of
private
enjoyments
utilitarian
ethics
thus
afford
a
remarkable
example
of
the
need
of
philosophic
reconstruction
which
these
lectures
have
been
presenting
up
to
a
certain
point
it
reflected
the
meaning
of
modern
thought
and
aspirations
but
it
was
still
tied
down
by
fundamental
ideas
of
that
very
order
which
it
thought
it
had
completely
left
behind
the
idea
of
a
fixed
and
single
end
lying
beyond
the
diversity
of
human
needs
and
acts
rendered
utilitarianism
incapable
of
being
an
adequate
representative
of
the
modern
spirit
it
has
to
be
reconstructed
through
emancipation
from
its
inherited
elements
if
a
few
words
are
added
upon
the
topic
of
education
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
suggesting
that
the
educative
process
is
all
one
with
the
moral
process
since
the
latter
is
a
continuous
passage
of
experience
from
worse
to
better
education
has
been
traditionally
thought
of
as
preparation
as
learning
acquiring
certain
things
because
they
will
later
be
useful
the
end
is
remote
and
education
is
getting
ready
is
a
preliminary
to
something
more
important
to
happen
later
on
childhood
is
only
a
preparation
for
adult
life
and
adult
life
for
another
life
always
the
future
not
the
present
has
been
the
significant
thing
in
education
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
skill
for
future
use
and
enjoyment
formation
of
habits
required
later
in
life
in
business
good
citizenship
and
pursuit
of
science
education
is
thought
of
also
as
something
needed
by
some
human
beings
merely
because
of
their
dependence
upon
others
we
are
born
ignorant
unversed
unskilled
immature
and
consequently
in
a
state
of
social
dependence
instruction
training
moral
discipline
are
processes
by
which
the
mature
the
adult
gradually
raise
the
helpless
to
the
point
where
they
can
look
out
for
themselves
the
business
of
childhood
is
to
grow
into
the
independence
of
adulthood
by
means
of
the
guidance
of
those
who
have
already
attained
it
thus
the
process
of
education
as
the
main
business
of
life
ends
when
the
young
have
arrived
at
emancipation
from
social
dependence
these
two
ideas
generally
assumed
but
rarely
explicitly
reasoned
out
contravene
the
conception
that
growing
or
the
continuous
reconstruction
of
experience
is
the
only
end
if
at
whatever
period
we
choose
to
take
a
person
he
is
still
in
process
of
growth
then
education
is
not
save
as
a
a
preparation
for
something
coming
later
getting
from
the
present
the
degree
and
kind
of
growth
there
is
in
it
is
education
this
is
a
constant
function
independent
of
age
the
best
thing
that
can
be
said
about
any
special
process
of
education
like
that
of
the
formal
school
period
is
that
it
renders
its
subject
capable
of
further
education
more
sensitive
to
conditions
of
growth
and
more
able
to
take
advantage
of
them
acquisition
of
skill
possession
of
knowledge
attainment
of
culture
are
not
ends
they
are
marks
of
growth
and
means
to
its
continuing
the
contrast
usually
assumed
between
the
period
of
education
as
one
of
social
dependence
and
of
maturity
as
one
of
social
independence
does
harm
we
repeat
over
and
over
that
man
is
a
social
animal
and
then
confine
the
significance
of
this
statement
to
the
sphere
in
which
sociality
usually
seems
least
evident
politics
the
heart
of
the
sociality
of
man
is
in
education
the
idea
of
education
as
preparation
and
of
adulthood
as
a
fixed
limit
of
growth
are
two
sides
of
the
same
obnoxious
untruth
if
the
moral
business
of
the
adult
as
well
as
the
young
is
a
growing
and
developing
experience
then
the
instruction
that
comes
from
social
dependencies
and
interdependencies
are
as
important
for
the
adult
as
for
the
child
moral
independence
for
the
adult
means
arrest
of
growth
isolation
means
induration
we
exaggerate
the
intellectual
dependence
of
childhood
so
that
children
are
too
much
kept
in
leading
strings
and
then
we
exaggerate
the
independence
of
adult
life
from
intimacy
of
contacts
and
communication
with
others
when
the
identity
of
the
moral
process
with
the
processes
of
specific
growth
is
realized
the
more
conscious
and
formal
education
of
childhood
will
be
seen
to
be
the
most
economical
and
efficient
means
of
social
advance
and
reorganization
and
it
will
also
be
evident
that
the
test
of
all
the
institutions
of
adult
life
is
their
effect
in
furthering
continued
education
government
business
art
religion
all
social
institutions
have
a
meaning
a
purpose
that
purpose
is
to
set
free
and
to
develop
the
capacities
of
human
individuals
without
respect
to
race
sex
class
or
economic
status
and
this
is
all
one
with
saying
that
the
test
of
their
value
is
the
extent
to
which
they
educate
every
individual
into
the
full
stature
of
his
possibility
democracy
has
many
meanings
but
if
it
has
a
moral
meaning
it
is
found
in
resolving
that
the
supreme
test
of
all
political
institutions
and
industrial
arrangements
shall
be
the
contribution
they
make
to
the
growth
of
every
member
of
society
chapter
viii
reconstruction
as
affecting
social
philosophy
how
can
philosophic
change
seriously
affect
social
philosophy
as
far
as
fundamentals
are
concerned
every
view
and
combination
appears
to
have
been
formulated
already
society
is
composed
of
individuals
this
obvious
and
basic
fact
no
philosophy
whatever
its
pretensions
to
novelty
can
question
or
alter
hence
these
three
alternatives
society
must
exist
for
the
sake
of
individuals
or
individuals
must
have
their
ends
and
ways
of
living
set
for
them
by
society
or
else
society
and
individuals
are
correlative
organic
to
one
another
society
requiring
the
service
and
subordination
of
individuals
and
at
the
same
time
existing
to
serve
them
beyond
these
three
views
none
seems
to
be
logically
conceivable
moreover
while
each
of
the
three
types
includes
many
subspecies
and
variations
within
itself
yet
the
changes
seem
to
have
been
so
thoroughly
rung
that
at
most
only
minor
variations
are
now
possible
especially
would
it
seem
true
that
the
organic
conception
meets
all
the
objections
to
the
extreme
individualistic
and
extreme
socialistic
theories
avoiding
the
errors
alike
of
plato
and
bentham
just
because
society
is
composed
of
individuals
it
would
seem
that
individuals
and
the
associative
relations
that
hold
them
together
must
be
of
coequal
importance
without
strong
and
competent
individuals
the
bonds
and
ties
that
form
society
have
nothing
to
lay
hold
on
apart
from
associations
with
one
another
individuals
are
isolated
from
one
another
and
fade
and
wither
or
are
opposed
to
one
another
and
their
conflicts
injure
individual
development
law
state
church
family
friendship
industrial
association
these
and
other
institutions
and
arrangements
are
necessary
in
order
that
individuals
may
grow
and
find
their
specific
capacities
and
functions
without
their
aid
and
support
human
life
is
as
hobbes
said
brutish
solitary
nasty
we
plunge
into
the
heart
of
the
matter
by
asserting
that
these
various
theories
suffer
from
a
common
defect
they
are
all
committed
to
the
logic
of
general
notions
under
which
specific
situations
are
to
be
brought
what
we
want
light
upon
is
this
or
that
group
of
individuals
this
or
that
concrete
human
being
this
or
that
special
institution
or
social
arrangement
for
such
a
logic
of
inquiry
the
traditionally
accepted
logic
substitutes
discussion
of
the
meaning
of
concepts
and
their
dialectical
relationship
to
one
another
the
discussion
goes
on
in
terms
of
state
individual
the
nature
of
institutions
as
such
society
in
general
we
need
guidance
in
dealing
with
particular
perplexities
in
domestic
life
and
are
met
by
dissertations
on
the
family
or
by
assertions
of
the
sacredness
of
individual
personality
we
want
to
know
about
the
worth
of
the
institution
of
private
property
as
it
operates
under
given
conditions
of
definite
time
and
place
we
meet
with
the
reply
of
proudhon
that
property
generally
is
theft
or
with
that
of
hegel
that
the
realization
of
will
is
the
end
of
all
institutions
and
that
private
ownership
as
the
expression
of
mastery
of
personality
over
physical
nature
is
a
necessary
element
in
such
realization
both
answers
may
have
a
certain
suggestiveness
in
connection
with
specific
situations
but
the
conceptions
are
not
proffered
for
what
they
may
be
worth
in
connection
with
special
historic
phenomena
they
are
general
answers
supposed
to
have
a
universal
meaning
that
covers
and
dominates
all
particulars
hence
they
do
not
assist
inquiry
they
close
it
they
are
not
instrumentalities
to
be
employed
and
tested
in
clarifying
concrete
social
difficulties
they
are
principles
to
be
imposed
upon
particulars
in
order
to
determine
their
nature
they
tell
us
about
state
when
we
want
to
know
about
state
but
the
implication
is
that
what
is
said
about
state
applies
to
any
state
that
we
happen
to
wish
to
know
about
in
transferring
the
issue
from
concrete
situations
to
definitions
and
conceptual
deductions
the
effect
especially
of
the
organic
theory
is
to
supply
the
apparatus
for
intellectual
justification
of
the
established
order
those
most
interested
in
practical
social
progress
and
the
emancipation
of
groups
from
oppression
have
turned
a
cold
shoulder
to
the
organic
theory
the
effect
if
not
the
intention
of
german
idealism
as
applied
in
social
philosophy
was
to
provide
a
bulwark
for
the
maintenance
of
the
political
against
the
tide
of
radical
ideas
coming
from
revolutionary
france
although
hegel
asserted
in
explicit
form
that
the
end
of
states
and
institutions
is
to
further
the
realization
of
the
freedom
of
all
his
effect
was
to
consecrate
the
prussian
state
and
to
enshrine
bureaucratic
absolutism
was
this
apologetic
tendency
accidental
or
did
it
spring
from
something
in
the
logic
of
the
notions
that
were
employed
surely
the
latter
if
we
talk
about
state
and
individual
rather
than
about
this
or
that
political
organization
and
this
or
that
group
of
needy
and
suffering
human
beings
the
tendency
is
to
throw
the
glamor
and
prestige
the
meaning
and
value
attached
to
the
general
notion
over
the
concrete
situation
and
thereby
to
cover
up
the
defects
of
the
latter
and
disguise
the
need
of
serious
reforms
the
meanings
which
are
found
in
the
general
notions
are
injected
into
the
particulars
that
come
under
them
quite
properly
so
if
we
once
grant
the
logic
of
rigid
universals
under
which
the
concrete
cases
have
to
be
subsumed
in
order
to
be
understood
and
explained
again
the
tendency
of
the
organic
point
of
view
is
to
minimize
the
significance
of
specific
conflicts
since
the
individual
and
the
state
or
social
institution
are
but
two
sides
of
the
same
reality
since
they
are
already
reconciled
in
principle
and
conception
the
conflict
in
any
particular
case
can
be
but
apparent
since
in
theory
the
individual
and
the
state
are
reciprocally
necessary
and
helpful
to
one
another
why
pay
much
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
state
a
whole
group
of
individuals
are
suffering
from
oppressive
conditions
in
reality
their
interests
can
not
be
in
conflict
with
those
of
the
state
to
which
they
belong
the
opposition
is
only
superficial
and
casual
capital
and
labor
can
not
really
conflict
because
each
is
an
organic
necessity
to
the
other
and
both
to
the
organized
community
as
a
whole
there
can
not
really
be
any
because
men
and
women
are
indispensable
both
to
one
another
and
to
the
state
in
his
day
aristotle
could
easily
employ
the
logic
of
general
concepts
superior
to
individuals
to
show
that
the
institution
of
slavery
was
in
the
interests
both
of
the
state
and
of
the
slave
class
even
if
the
intention
is
not
to
justify
the
existing
order
the
effect
is
to
divert
attention
from
special
situations
rationalistic
logic
formerly
made
men
careless
in
observation
of
the
concrete
in
physical
philosophy
it
now
operates
to
depress
and
retard
observation
in
specific
social
phenomena
the
social
philosopher
dwelling
in
the
region
of
his
concepts
solves
problems
by
showing
the
relationship
of
ideas
instead
of
helping
men
solve
problems
in
the
concrete
by
supplying
them
hypotheses
to
be
used
and
tested
in
projects
of
reform
meanwhile
of
course
the
concrete
troubles
and
evils
remain
they
are
not
magically
waived
out
of
existence
because
in
theory
society
is
organic
the
region
of
concrete
difficulties
where
the
assistance
of
intelligent
method
for
tentative
plans
for
experimentation
is
urgently
needed
is
precisely
where
intelligence
fails
to
operate
in
this
region
of
the
specific
and
concrete
men
are
thrown
back
upon
the
crudest
empiricism
upon
opportunism
and
the
matching
of
brute
forces
in
theory
the
particulars
are
all
neatly
disposed
of
they
come
under
their
appropriate
heading
and
category
they
are
labelled
and
go
into
an
orderly
in
a
systematic
filing
cabinet
labelled
political
science
or
sociology
but
in
empirical
fact
they
remain
as
perplexing
confused
and
unorganized
as
they
were
before
so
they
are
dealt
with
not
by
even
an
endeavor
at
scientific
method
but
by
blind
rule
of
thumb
citation
of
precedents
considerations
of
immediate
advantage
smoothing
things
over
use
of
coercive
force
and
the
clash
of
personal
ambitions
the
world
still
survives
it
has
therefore
got
on
somehow
so
much
can
not
be
denied
the
method
of
trial
and
error
and
competition
of
selfishnesses
has
somehow
wrought
out
many
improvements
but
social
theory
nevertheless
exists
as
an
idle
luxury
rather
than
as
a
guiding
method
of
inquiry
and
planning
in
the
question
of
methods
concerned
with
reconstruction
of
special
situations
rather
than
in
any
refinements
in
the
general
concepts
of
institution
individuality
state
freedom
law
order
progress
lies
the
true
impact
of
philosophical
reconstruction
consider
the
conception
of
the
individual
self
the
individualistic
school
of
england
and
france
in
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
was
empirical
in
intent
it
based
its
individualism
philosophically
speaking
upon
the
belief
that
individuals
are
alone
real
that
classes
and
organizations
are
secondary
and
derived
they
are
artificial
while
individuals
are
natural
in
what
way
then
can
individualism
be
said
to
come
under
the
animadversions
that
have
been
passed
to
say
the
defect
was
that
this
school
overlooked
those
connections
with
other
persons
which
are
a
part
of
the
constitution
of
every
individual
is
true
as
far
as
it
goes
but
unfortunately
it
rarely
goes
beyond
the
point
of
just
that
wholesale
justification
of
institutions
which
has
been
criticized
the
real
difficulty
is
that
the
individual
is
regarded
as
something
something
already
there
consequently
he
can
only
be
something
to
be
catered
to
something
whose
pleasures
are
to
be
magnified
and
possessions
multiplied
when
the
individual
is
taken
as
something
given
already
anything
that
can
be
done
to
him
or
for
him
it
can
only
be
by
way
of
external
impressions
and
belongings
sensations
of
pleasure
and
pain
comforts
securities
now
it
is
true
that
social
arrangements
laws
institutions
are
made
for
man
rather
than
that
man
is
made
for
them
that
they
are
means
and
agencies
of
human
welfare
and
progress
but
they
are
not
means
for
obtaining
something
for
individuals
not
even
happiness
they
are
means
of
individuals
only
in
the
physical
sense
of
physical
bodies
that
to
the
senses
are
separate
is
individuality
an
original
datum
individuality
in
a
social
and
moral
sense
is
something
to
be
wrought
out
it
means
initiative
inventiveness
varied
resourcefulness
assumption
of
responsibility
in
choice
of
belief
and
conduct
these
are
not
gifts
but
achievements
as
achievements
they
are
not
absolute
but
relative
to
the
use
that
is
to
be
made
of
them
and
this
use
varies
with
the
environment
the
import
of
this
conception
comes
out
in
considering
the
fortunes
of
the
idea
of
all
members
of
the
empirical
school
emphasized
this
idea
it
was
the
sole
motive
of
mankind
virtue
was
to
be
attained
by
making
benevolent
action
profitable
to
the
individual
social
arrangements
were
to
be
reformed
so
that
egoism
and
altruistic
consideration
of
others
would
be
identified
moralists
of
the
opposite
school
were
not
backward
in
pointing
out
the
evils
of
any
theory
that
reduced
both
morals
and
political
science
to
means
of
calculating
consequently
they
threw
the
whole
idea
of
interest
overboard
as
obnoxious
to
morals
the
effect
of
this
reaction
was
to
strengthen
the
cause
of
authority
and
political
obscurantism
when
the
play
of
interest
is
eliminated
what
remains
what
concrete
moving
forces
can
be
found
those
who
identified
the
self
with
something
and
its
interest
with
acquisition
of
pleasure
and
profit
took
the
most
effective
means
possible
to
reinstate
the
logic
of
abstract
conceptions
of
law
justice
sovereignty
freedom
all
of
those
vague
general
ideas
that
for
all
their
seeming
rigidity
can
be
manipulated
by
any
clever
politician
to
cover
up
his
designs
and
to
make
the
worse
seem
the
better
cause
interests
are
specific
and
dynamic
they
are
the
natural
terms
of
any
concrete
social
thinking
but
they
are
damned
beyond
recovery
when
they
are
identified
with
the
things
of
a
petty
selfishness
they
can
be
employed
as
vital
terms
only
when
the
self
is
seen
to
be
in
process
and
interest
to
be
a
name
for
whatever
is
concerned
in
furthering
its
movement
the
same
logic
applies
to
the
old
dispute
of
whether
reform
should
start
with
the
individual
or
with
institutions
when
the
self
is
regarded
as
something
complete
within
itself
then
it
is
readily
argued
that
only
internal
moralistic
changes
are
of
importance
in
general
reform
institutional
changes
are
said
to
be
merely
external
they
may
add
conveniences
and
comforts
to
life
but
they
can
not
effect
moral
improvements
the
result
is
to
throw
the
burden
for
social
improvement
upon
in
its
most
impossible
form
moreover
social
and
economic
passivity
are
encouraged
individuals
are
led
to
concentrate
in
moral
introspection
upon
their
own
vices
and
virtues
and
to
neglect
the
character
of
the
environment
morals
withdraw
from
active
concern
with
detailed
economic
and
political
conditions
let
us
perfect
ourselves
within
and
in
due
season
changes
in
society
will
come
of
themselves
is
the
teaching
and
while
saints
are
engaged
in
introspection
burly
sinners
run
the
world
but
when
is
perceived
to
be
an
active
process
it
is
also
seen
that
social
modifications
are
the
only
means
of
the
creation
of
changed
personalities
institutions
are
viewed
in
their
educative
effect
with
reference
to
the
types
of
individuals
they
foster
the
interest
in
individual
moral
improvement
and
the
social
interest
in
objective
reform
of
economic
and
political
conditions
are
identified
and
inquiry
into
the
meaning
of
social
arrangements
gets
definite
point
and
direction
we
are
led
to
ask
what
the
specific
stimulating
fostering
and
nurturing
power
of
each
specific
social
arrangement
may
be
the
separation
between
politics
and
morals
is
abolished
at
its
root
consequently
we
can
not
be
satisfied
with
the
general
statement
that
society
and
the
state
is
organic
to
the
individual
the
question
is
one
of
specific
causations
just
what
response
does
social
arrangement
political
or
economic
evoke
and
what
effect
does
it
have
upon
the
disposition
of
those
who
engage
in
it
does
it
release
capacity
if
so
how
widely
among
a
few
with
a
corresponding
depression
in
others
or
in
an
extensive
and
equitable
way
is
the
capacity
which
is
set
free
also
directed
in
some
coherent
way
so
that
it
becomes
a
power
or
its
manifestation
spasmodic
and
capricious
since
responses
are
of
an
indefinite
diversity
of
kind
these
inquiries
have
to
be
detailed
and
specific
are
men
senses
rendered
more
delicately
sensitive
and
appreciative
or
are
they
blunted
and
dulled
by
this
and
that
form
of
social
organization
are
their
minds
trained
so
that
the
hands
are
more
deft
and
cunning
is
curiosity
awakened
or
blunted
what
is
its
quality
is
it
merely
esthetic
dwelling
on
the
forms
and
surfaces
of
things
or
is
it
also
an
intellectual
searching
into
their
meaning
such
questions
as
these
as
well
as
the
more
obvious
ones
about
the
qualities
conventionally
labelled
moral
become
the
of
inquiries
about
every
institution
of
the
community
when
it
is
recognized
that
individuality
is
not
originally
given
but
is
created
under
the
influences
of
associated
life
like
utilitarianism
the
theory
subjects
every
form
of
organization
to
continual
scrutiny
and
criticism
but
instead
of
leading
us
to
ask
what
it
does
in
the
way
of
causing
pains
and
pleasures
to
individuals
already
in
existence
it
inquires
what
is
done
to
release
specific
capacities
and
them
into
working
powers
what
sort
of
individuals
are
created
the
waste
of
mental
energy
due
to
conducting
discussion
of
social
affairs
in
terms
of
conceptual
generalities
is
astonishing
how
far
would
the
biologist
and
the
physician
progress
if
when
the
subject
of
respiration
is
under
consideration
discussion
confined
itself
to
bandying
back
and
forth
the
concepts
of
organ
and
organism
if
for
example
one
school
thought
respiration
could
be
known
and
understood
by
insisting
upon
the
fact
that
it
occurs
in
an
individual
body
and
therefore
is
an
individual
phenomenon
while
an
opposite
school
insisted
that
it
is
simply
one
function
in
organic
interaction
with
others
and
can
be
known
or
understood
therefore
only
by
reference
to
other
functions
taken
in
an
equally
general
or
wholesale
way
each
proposition
is
equally
true
and
equally
futile
what
is
needed
is
specific
inquiries
into
a
multitude
of
specific
structures
and
interactions
not
only
does
the
solemn
reiteration
of
categories
of
individual
and
organic
or
social
whole
not
further
these
definite
and
detailed
inquiries
but
it
checks
them
it
detains
thought
within
pompous
and
sonorous
generalities
wherein
controversy
is
as
inevitable
as
it
is
incapable
of
solution
it
is
true
enough
that
if
cells
were
not
in
vital
interaction
with
one
another
they
could
neither
conflict
nor
but
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
an
organic
social
group
instead
of
answering
any
questions
merely
marks
the
fact
that
questions
exist
just
what
conflicts
and
what
occur
and
what
are
their
specific
causes
and
consequences
but
because
of
the
persistence
within
social
philosophy
of
the
order
of
ideas
that
has
been
expelled
from
natural
philosophy
even
sociologists
take
conflict
or
as
general
categories
upon
which
to
base
their
science
and
condescend
to
empirical
facts
only
for
illustrations
as
a
rule
their
chief
problem
is
a
purely
dialectical
one
covered
up
by
a
thick
quilt
of
empirical
anthropological
and
historical
citations
how
do
individuals
unite
to
form
society
how
are
individuals
socially
controlled
and
the
problem
is
justly
called
dialectical
because
it
springs
from
antecedent
conceptions
of
individual
and
social
just
as
individual
is
not
one
thing
but
is
a
blanket
term
for
the
immense
variety
of
specific
reactions
habits
dispositions
and
powers
of
human
nature
that
are
evoked
and
confirmed
under
the
influences
of
associated
life
so
with
the
term
social
society
is
one
word
but
infinitely
many
things
it
covers
all
the
ways
in
which
by
associating
together
men
share
their
experiences
and
build
up
common
interests
and
aims
street
gangs
schools
for
burglary
clans
social
cliques
trades
unions
joint
stock
corporations
villages
and
international
alliances
the
new
method
takes
effect
in
substituting
inquiry
into
these
specific
changing
and
relative
facts
relative
to
problems
and
purposes
not
metaphysically
relative
for
solemn
manipulation
of
general
notions
strangely
enough
the
current
conception
of
the
state
is
a
case
in
point
for
one
direct
influence
of
the
classic
order
of
fixed
species
arranged
in
hierarchical
order
is
the
attempt
of
german
political
philosophy
in
the
nineteenth
century
to
enumerate
a
definite
number
of
institutions
each
having
its
own
essential
and
immutable
meaning
to
arrange
them
in
an
order
of
evolution
which
corresponds
with
the
dignity
and
rank
of
the
respective
meanings
the
national
state
was
placed
at
the
top
as
the
consummation
and
culmination
and
also
the
basis
of
all
other
institutions
hegel
is
a
striking
example
of
this
industry
but
he
is
far
from
the
only
one
many
who
have
bitterly
quarrelled
with
him
have
only
differed
as
to
the
details
of
the
evolution
or
as
to
the
particular
meaning
to
be
attributed
as
essential
to
some
one
of
the
enumerated
institutions
the
quarrel
has
been
bitter
only
because
the
underlying
premises
were
the
same
particularly
have
many
schools
of
thought
varying
even
more
widely
in
respect
to
method
and
conclusion
agreed
upon
the
final
consummating
position
of
the
state
they
may
not
go
as
far
as
hegel
in
making
the
sole
meaning
of
history
to
be
the
evolution
of
national
territorial
states
each
of
which
embodies
more
than
the
prior
form
of
the
essential
meaning
or
conception
of
state
and
consequently
displaces
it
until
we
arrive
at
that
triumph
of
historical
evolution
the
prussian
state
but
they
do
not
question
the
unique
and
supreme
position
of
the
state
in
the
social
hierarchy
indeed
that
conception
has
hardened
into
unquestionable
dogma
under
the
title
of
sovereignty
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
tremendously
important
rôle
played
by
the
modern
territorial
national
state
the
formation
of
these
states
has
been
the
centre
of
modern
political
history
france
great
britain
spain
were
the
first
peoples
to
attain
nationalistic
organization
but
in
the
nineteenth
century
their
example
was
followed
by
japan
germany
and
italy
to
say
nothing
of
a
large
number
of
smaller
states
greece
servia
bulgaria
etc
as
everybody
knows
one
of
the
most
important
phases
of
the
recent
world
war
was
the
struggle
to
complete
the
nationalistic
movement
resulting
in
the
erection
of
bohemia
poland
into
independent
states
and
the
accession
of
armenia
palestine
to
the
rank
of
candidates
the
struggle
for
the
supremacy
of
the
state
over
other
forms
of
organization
was
directed
against
the
power
of
minor
districts
provinces
principalities
against
the
dispersion
of
power
among
feudal
lords
as
well
as
in
some
countries
against
the
pretensions
of
an
ecclesiastic
potentate
the
state
represents
the
conspicuous
culmination
of
the
great
movement
of
social
integration
and
consolidation
taking
place
in
the
last
few
centuries
tremendously
accelerated
by
the
concentrating
and
combining
forces
of
steam
and
electricity
naturally
inevitably
the
students
of
political
science
have
been
preoccupied
with
this
great
historic
phenomenon
and
their
intellectual
activities
have
been
directed
to
its
systematic
formulation
because
the
contemporary
progressive
movement
was
to
establish
the
unified
state
against
the
inertia
of
minor
social
units
and
against
the
ambitions
of
rivals
for
power
political
theory
developed
the
dogma
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
national
state
internally
and
externally
as
the
work
of
integration
and
consolidation
reaches
its
climax
the
question
arises
however
whether
the
national
state
once
it
is
firmly
established
and
no
longer
struggling
against
strong
foes
is
not
just
an
instrumentality
for
promoting
and
protecting
other
and
more
voluntary
forms
of
association
rather
than
a
supreme
end
in
itself
two
actual
phenomena
may
be
pointed
to
in
support
of
an
affirmative
answer
along
with
the
development
of
the
larger
more
inclusive
and
more
unified
organization
of
the
state
has
gone
the
emancipation
of
individuals
from
restrictions
and
servitudes
previously
imposed
by
custom
and
class
status
but
the
individuals
freed
from
external
and
coercive
bonds
have
not
remained
isolated
social
molecules
have
at
once
recombined
in
new
associations
and
organizations
compulsory
associations
have
been
replaced
by
voluntary
ones
rigid
organizations
by
those
more
amenable
to
human
choice
and
purposes
more
directly
changeable
at
will
what
upon
one
side
looks
like
a
movement
toward
individualism
turns
out
to
be
really
a
movement
toward
multiplying
all
kinds
and
varieties
of
associations
political
parties
industrial
corporations
scientific
and
artistic
organizations
trade
unions
churches
schools
clubs
and
societies
without
number
for
the
cultivation
of
every
conceivable
interest
that
men
have
in
common
as
they
develop
in
number
and
importance
the
state
tends
to
become
more
and
more
a
regulator
and
adjuster
among
them
defining
the
limits
of
their
actions
preventing
and
settling
conflicts
its
supremacy
approximates
that
of
the
conductor
of
an
orchestra
who
makes
no
music
himself
but
who
harmonizes
the
activities
of
those
who
in
producing
it
are
doing
the
thing
intrinsically
worth
while
the
state
remains
highly
important
but
its
importance
consists
more
and
more
in
its
power
to
foster
and
the
activities
of
voluntary
groupings
only
nominally
is
it
in
any
modern
community
the
end
for
the
sake
of
which
all
the
other
societies
and
organizations
exist
groupings
for
promoting
the
diversity
of
goods
that
men
share
have
become
the
real
social
units
they
occupy
the
place
which
traditional
theory
has
claimed
either
for
mere
isolated
individuals
or
for
the
supreme
and
single
political
organization
pluralism
is
well
ordained
in
present
political
practice
and
demands
a
modification
of
hierarchical
and
monistic
theory
every
combination
of
human
forces
that
adds
its
own
contribution
of
value
to
life
has
for
that
reason
its
own
unique
and
ultimate
worth
it
can
not
be
degraded
into
a
means
to
glorify
the
state
one
reason
for
the
increased
demoralization
of
war
is
that
it
forces
the
state
into
an
abnormally
supreme
position
the
other
concrete
fact
is
the
opposition
between
the
claim
of
independent
sovereignty
in
behalf
of
the
territorial
national
state
and
the
growth
of
international
and
what
have
well
been
called
interests
the
weal
and
woe
of
any
modern
state
is
bound
up
with
that
of
others
weakness
disorder
false
principles
on
the
part
of
any
state
are
not
confined
within
its
boundaries
they
spread
and
infect
other
states
the
same
is
true
of
economic
artistic
and
scientific
advances
moreover
the
voluntary
associations
just
spoken
of
do
not
coincide
with
political
boundaries
associations
of
mathematicians
chemists
astronomers
business
corporations
labor
organizations
churches
are
because
the
interests
they
represent
are
worldwide
in
such
ways
as
these
internationalism
is
not
an
aspiration
but
a
fact
not
a
sentimental
ideal
but
a
force
yet
these
interests
are
cut
across
and
thrown
out
of
gear
by
the
traditional
doctrine
of
exclusive
national
sovereignty
it
is
the
vogue
of
this
doctrine
or
dogma
that
presents
the
strongest
barrier
to
the
effective
formation
of
an
international
mind
which
alone
agrees
with
the
moving
forces
of
labor
commerce
science
art
and
religion
society
as
was
said
is
many
associations
not
a
single
organization
society
means
association
coming
together
in
joint
intercourse
and
action
for
the
better
realization
of
any
form
of
experience
which
is
augmented
and
confirmed
by
being
shared
hence
there
are
as
many
associations
as
there
are
goods
which
are
enhanced
by
being
mutually
communicated
and
participated
in
and
these
are
literally
indefinite
in
number
indeed
capacity
to
endure
publicity
and
communication
is
the
test
by
which
it
is
decided
whether
a
pretended
good
is
genuine
or
spurious
moralists
have
always
insisted
upon
the
fact
that
good
is
universal
objective
not
just
private
particular
but
too
often
like
plato
they
have
been
content
with
a
metaphysical
universality
or
like
kant
with
a
logical
universality
communication
sharing
joint
participation
are
the
only
actual
ways
of
universalizing
the
moral
law
and
end
we
insisted
at
the
last
hour
upon
the
unique
character
of
every
intrinsic
good
but
the
counterpart
of
this
proposition
is
that
the
situation
in
which
a
good
is
consciously
realized
is
not
one
of
transient
sensations
or
private
appetites
but
one
of
sharing
and
communication
public
social
even
the
hermit
communes
with
gods
or
spirits
even
misery
loves
company
and
the
most
extreme
selfishness
includes
a
band
of
followers
or
some
partner
to
share
in
the
attained
good
universalization
means
socialization
the
extension
of
the
area
and
range
of
those
who
share
in
a
good
the
increasing
acknowledgment
that
goods
exist
and
endure
only
through
being
communicated
and
that
association
is
the
means
of
conjoint
sharing
lies
back
of
the
modern
sense
of
humanity
and
democracy
it
is
the
saving
salt
in
altruism
and
philanthropy
which
without
this
factor
degenerate
into
moral
condescension
and
moral
interference
taking
the
form
of
trying
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
others
under
the
guise
of
doing
them
good
or
of
conferring
upon
them
some
right
as
if
it
were
a
gift
of
charity
it
follows
that
organization
is
never
an
end
in
itself
it
is
a
means
of
promoting
of
multiplying
effective
points
of
contact
between
persons
directing
their
intercourse
into
the
modes
of
greatest
fruitfulness
the
tendency
to
treat
organization
as
an
end
in
itself
is
responsible
for
all
the
exaggerated
theories
in
which
individuals
are
subordinated
to
some
institution
to
which
is
given
the
noble
name
of
society
society
is
the
of
associating
in
such
ways
that
experiences
ideas
emotions
values
are
transmitted
and
made
common
to
this
active
process
both
the
individual
and
the
institutionally
organized
may
truly
be
said
to
be
subordinate
the
individual
is
subordinate
because
except
in
and
through
communication
of
experience
from
and
to
others
he
remains
dumb
merely
sentient
a
brute
animal
only
in
association
with
fellows
does
he
become
a
conscious
centre
of
experience
organization
which
is
what
traditional
theory
has
generally
meant
by
the
term
society
or
state
is
also
subordinate
because
it
becomes
static
rigid
institutionalized
whenever
it
is
not
employed
to
facilitate
and
enrich
the
contacts
of
human
beings
with
one
another
the
controversy
between
rights
and
duties
law
and
freedom
is
another
version
of
the
strife
between
the
individual
and
society
as
fixed
concepts
freedom
for
an
individual
means
growth
ready
change
when
modification
is
required
it
signifies
an
active
process
that
of
release
of
capacity
from
whatever
hems
it
in
but
since
society
can
develop
only
as
new
resources
are
put
at
its
disposal
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
freedom
has
positive
significance
for
individuality
but
negative
meaning
for
social
interests
society
is
strong
forceful
stable
against
accident
only
when
all
its
members
can
function
to
the
limit
of
their
capacity
such
functioning
can
not
be
achieved
without
allowing
a
leeway
of
experimentation
beyond
the
limits
of
established
and
sanctioned
custom
a
certain
amount
of
overt
confusion
and
irregularity
is
likely
to
accompany
the
granting
of
the
margin
of
liberty
without
which
capacity
can
not
find
itself
but
socially
as
well
as
scientifically
the
great
thing
is
not
to
avoid
mistakes
but
to
have
them
take
place
under
conditions
such
that
they
can
be
utilized
to
increase
intelligence
in
the
future
if
british
liberal
social
philosophy
tended
true
to
the
spirit
of
its
atomistic
empiricism
to
make
freedom
and
the
exercise
of
rights
ends
in
themselves
the
remedy
is
not
to
be
found
in
recourse
to
a
philosophy
of
fixed
obligations
and
authoritative
law
such
as
characterized
german
political
thinking
the
latter
as
events
have
demonstrated
is
dangerous
because
of
its
implicit
menace
to
the
free
of
other
social
groups
but
it
is
also
weak
internally
when
put
to
the
final
test
in
its
hostility
to
the
free
experimentation
and
power
of
choice
of
the
individual
in
determining
social
affairs
it
limits
the
capacity
of
many
or
most
individuals
to
share
effectively
in
social
operations
and
thereby
deprives
society
of
the
full
contribution
of
all
its
members
the
best
guarantee
of
collective
efficiency
and
power
is
liberation
and
use
of
the
diversity
of
individual
capacities
in
initiative
planning
foresight
vigor
and
endurance
personality
must
be
educated
and
personality
can
not
be
educated
by
confining
its
operations
to
technical
and
specialized
things
or
to
the
less
important
relationships
of
life
full
education
comes
only
when
there
is
a
responsible
share
on
the
part
of
each
person
in
proportion
to
capacity
in
shaping
the
aims
and
policies
of
the
social
groups
to
which
he
belongs
this
fact
fixes
the
significance
of
democracy
it
can
not
be
conceived
as
a
sectarian
or
racial
thing
nor
as
a
consecration
of
some
form
of
government
which
has
already
attained
constitutional
sanction
it
is
but
a
name
for
the
fact
that
human
nature
is
developed
only
when
its
elements
take
part
in
directing
things
which
are
common
things
for
the
sake
of
which
men
and
women
form
groups
families
industrial
companies
governments
churches
scientific
associations
and
so
on
the
principle
holds
as
much
of
one
form
of
association
say
in
industry
and
commerce
as
it
does
in
government
the
identification
of
democracy
with
political
democracy
which
is
responsible
for
most
of
its
failures
is
however
based
upon
the
traditional
ideas
which
make
the
individual
and
the
state
entities
in
themselves
as
the
new
ideas
find
adequate
expression
in
social
life
they
will
be
absorbed
into
a
moral
background
and
will
the
ideas
and
beliefs
themselves
be
deepened
and
be
unconsciously
transmitted
and
sustained
they
will
color
the
imagination
and
temper
the
desires
and
affections
they
will
not
form
a
set
of
ideas
to
be
expounded
reasoned
out
and
argumentatively
supported
but
will
be
a
spontaneous
way
of
envisaging
life
then
they
will
take
on
religious
value
the
religious
spirit
will
be
revivified
because
it
will
be
in
harmony
with
men
unquestioned
scientific
beliefs
and
their
ordinary
social
activities
it
will
not
be
obliged
to
lead
a
timid
and
life
because
tied
to
scientific
ideas
and
social
creeds
that
are
continuously
eaten
into
and
broken
down
but
especially
will
the
ideas
and
beliefs
themselves
be
deepened
and
intensified
because
spontaneously
fed
by
emotion
and
translated
into
imaginative
vision
and
fine
art
while
they
are
now
maintained
by
more
or
less
conscious
effort
by
deliberate
reflection
by
taking
thought
they
are
technical
and
abstract
just
because
they
are
not
as
yet
carried
as
matter
of
course
by
imagination
and
feelings
we
began
by
pointing
out
that
european
philosophy
arose
when
intellectual
methods
and
scientific
results
moved
away
from
social
traditions
which
had
consolidated
and
embodied
the
fruits
of
spontaneous
desire
and
fancy
it
was
pointed
out
that
philosophy
had
ever
since
had
the
problem
of
adjusting
the
dry
thin
and
meagre
scientific
standpoint
with
the
obstinately
persisting
body
of
warm
and
abounding
imaginative
beliefs
conceptions
of
possibility
progress
free
movement
and
infinitely
diversified
opportunity
have
been
suggested
by
modern
science
but
until
they
have
displaced
from
the
heritage
of
the
immutable
and
the
ordered
and
systematized
the
ideas
of
mechanism
and
matter
will
lie
like
a
dead
weight
upon
the
emotions
paralyzing
religion
and
distorting
art
when
the
liberation
of
capacity
no
longer
seems
a
menace
to
organization
and
established
institutions
something
that
can
not
be
avoided
practically
and
yet
something
that
is
a
threat
to
conservation
of
the
most
precious
values
of
the
past
when
the
liberating
of
human
capacity
operates
as
a
socially
creative
force
art
will
not
be
a
luxury
a
stranger
to
the
daily
occupations
of
making
a
living
making
a
living
economically
speaking
will
be
at
one
with
making
a
life
that
is
worth
living
and
when
the
emotional
force
the
mystic
force
one
might
say
of
communication
of
the
miracle
of
shared
life
and
shared
experience
is
spontaneously
felt
the
hardness
and
crudeness
of
contemporary
life
will
be
bathed
in
the
light
that
never
was
on
land
or
sea
poetry
art
religion
are
precious
things
they
can
not
be
maintained
by
lingering
in
the
past
and
futilely
wishing
to
restore
what
the
movement
of
events
in
science
industry
and
politics
has
destroyed
they
are
an
of
thought
and
desires
that
unconsciously
converge
into
a
disposition
of
imagination
as
a
result
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
daily
episodes
and
contact
they
can
not
be
willed
into
existence
or
coerced
into
being
the
wind
of
the
spirit
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
the
kingdom
of
god
in
such
things
does
not
come
with
observation
but
while
it
is
impossible
to
retain
and
recover
by
deliberate
volition
old
sources
of
religion
and
art
that
have
been
discredited
it
is
possible
to
expedite
the
development
of
the
vital
sources
of
a
religion
and
art
that
are
yet
to
be
not
indeed
by
action
directly
aimed
at
their
production
but
by
substituting
faith
in
the
active
tendencies
of
the
day
for
dread
and
dislike
of
them
and
by
the
courage
of
intelligence
to
follow
whither
social
and
scientific
changes
direct
us
we
are
weak
today
in
ideal
matters
because
intelligence
is
divorced
from
aspiration
the
bare
force
of
circumstance
compels
us
onwards
in
the
daily
detail
of
our
beliefs
and
acts
but
our
deeper
thoughts
and
desires
turn
backwards
when
philosophy
shall
have
with
the
course
of
events
and
made
clear
and
coherent
the
meaning
of
the
daily
detail
science
and
emotion
will
interpenetrate
practice
and
imagination
will
embrace
poetry
and
religious
feeling
will
be
the
unforced
flowers
of
life
to
further
this
articulation
and
revelation
of
the
meanings
of
the
current
course
