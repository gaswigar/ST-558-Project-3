louis
lambert
louis
lambert
was
born
at
montoire
a
little
town
in
the
vendomois
where
his
father
owned
a
tannery
of
no
great
magnitude
and
intended
that
his
son
should
succeed
him
but
his
precocious
bent
for
study
modified
the
paternal
decision
for
indeed
the
tanner
and
his
wife
adored
louis
their
only
child
and
never
contradicted
him
in
anything
at
the
age
of
five
louis
had
begun
by
reading
the
old
and
new
testaments
and
these
two
books
including
so
many
books
had
sealed
his
fate
could
that
childish
imagination
understand
the
mystical
depths
of
the
scriptures
could
it
so
early
follow
the
flight
of
the
holy
spirit
across
the
worlds
or
was
it
merely
attracted
by
the
romantic
touches
which
abound
in
those
oriental
poems
our
narrative
will
answer
these
questions
to
some
readers
one
thing
resulted
from
this
first
reading
of
the
bible
louis
went
all
over
montoire
begging
for
books
and
he
obtained
them
by
those
winning
ways
peculiar
to
children
which
no
one
can
resist
while
devoting
himself
to
these
studies
under
no
sort
of
guidance
he
reached
the
age
of
ten
at
that
period
substitutes
for
the
army
were
scarce
rich
families
secured
them
long
beforehand
to
have
them
ready
when
the
lots
were
drawn
the
poor
tanner
modest
fortune
did
not
allow
of
their
purchasing
a
substitute
for
their
son
and
they
saw
no
means
allowed
by
law
for
evading
the
conscription
but
that
of
making
him
a
priest
so
in
they
sent
him
to
his
maternal
uncle
the
parish
priest
of
mer
another
small
town
on
the
loire
not
far
from
blois
this
arrangement
at
once
satisfied
louis
passion
for
knowledge
and
his
parents
wish
not
to
expose
him
to
the
dreadful
chances
of
war
and
indeed
his
taste
for
study
and
precocious
intelligence
gave
grounds
for
hoping
that
he
might
rise
to
high
fortunes
in
the
church
after
remaining
for
about
three
years
with
his
uncle
an
old
and
not
uncultured
oratorian
louis
left
him
early
in
to
enter
the
college
at
vendome
where
he
was
maintained
at
the
cost
of
madame
de
stael
lambert
owed
the
favor
and
patronage
of
this
celebrated
lady
to
chance
or
shall
we
not
say
to
providence
who
can
smooth
the
path
of
forlorn
genius
to
us
indeed
who
do
not
see
below
the
surface
of
human
things
such
vicissitudes
of
which
we
find
many
examples
in
the
lives
of
great
men
appear
to
be
merely
the
result
of
physical
phenomena
to
most
biographers
the
head
of
a
man
of
genius
rises
above
the
herd
as
some
noble
plant
in
the
fields
attracts
the
eye
of
a
botanist
in
its
splendor
this
comparison
may
well
be
applied
to
louis
adventure
he
was
accustomed
to
spend
the
time
allowed
him
by
his
uncle
for
holidays
at
his
father
house
but
instead
of
indulging
after
the
manner
of
schoolboys
in
the
sweets
of
the
delightful
that
tempts
us
at
every
age
he
set
out
every
morning
with
part
of
a
loaf
and
his
books
and
went
to
read
and
meditate
in
the
woods
to
escape
his
mother
remonstrances
for
she
believed
such
persistent
study
to
be
injurious
how
admirable
is
a
mother
instinct
from
that
time
reading
was
in
louis
a
sort
of
appetite
which
nothing
could
satisfy
he
devoured
books
of
every
kind
feeding
indiscriminately
on
religious
works
history
philosophy
and
physics
he
has
told
me
that
he
found
indescribable
delight
in
reading
dictionaries
for
lack
of
other
books
and
i
readily
believed
him
what
scholar
has
not
many
a
time
found
pleasure
in
seeking
the
probable
meaning
of
some
unknown
word
the
analysis
of
a
word
its
physiognomy
and
history
would
be
to
lambert
matter
for
long
dreaming
but
these
were
not
the
instinctive
dreams
by
which
a
boy
accustoms
himself
to
the
phenomena
of
life
steels
himself
to
every
moral
or
physical
perception
an
involuntary
education
which
subsequently
brings
forth
fruit
both
in
the
understanding
and
character
of
a
man
no
louis
mastered
the
facts
and
he
accounted
for
them
after
seeking
out
both
the
principle
and
the
end
with
the
mother
wit
of
a
savage
indeed
from
the
age
of
fourteen
by
one
of
those
startling
freaks
in
which
nature
sometimes
indulges
and
which
proved
how
anomalous
was
his
temperament
he
would
utter
quite
simply
ideas
of
which
the
depth
was
not
revealed
to
me
till
a
long
time
after
often
he
has
said
to
me
when
speaking
of
his
studies
often
have
i
made
the
most
delightful
voyage
floating
on
a
word
down
the
abyss
of
the
past
like
an
insect
embarked
on
a
blade
of
grass
tossing
on
the
ripples
of
a
stream
starting
from
greece
i
would
get
to
rome
and
traverse
the
whole
extent
of
modern
ages
what
a
fine
book
might
be
written
of
the
life
and
adventures
of
a
word
it
has
of
course
received
various
stamps
from
the
occasions
on
which
it
has
served
its
purpose
it
has
conveyed
different
ideas
in
different
places
but
is
it
not
still
grander
to
think
of
it
under
the
three
aspects
of
soul
body
and
motion
merely
to
regard
it
in
the
abstract
apart
from
its
functions
its
effects
and
its
influence
is
enough
to
cast
one
into
an
ocean
of
meditations
are
not
most
words
colored
by
the
idea
they
represent
then
to
whose
genius
are
they
due
if
it
takes
great
intelligence
to
create
a
word
how
old
may
human
speech
be
the
combination
of
letters
their
shapes
and
the
look
they
give
to
the
word
are
the
exact
reflection
in
accordance
with
the
character
of
each
nation
of
the
unknown
beings
whose
traces
survive
in
us
who
can
philosophically
explain
the
transition
from
sensation
to
thought
from
thought
to
word
from
the
word
to
its
hieroglyphic
presentment
from
hieroglyphics
to
the
alphabet
from
the
alphabet
to
written
language
of
which
the
eloquent
beauty
resides
in
a
series
of
images
classified
by
rhetoric
and
forming
in
a
sense
the
hieroglyphics
of
thought
was
it
not
the
ancient
mode
of
representing
human
ideas
as
embodied
in
the
forms
of
animals
that
gave
rise
to
the
shapes
of
the
first
signs
used
in
the
east
for
writing
down
language
then
has
it
not
left
its
traces
by
tradition
on
our
modern
languages
which
have
all
seized
some
remnant
of
the
primitive
speech
of
nations
a
majestic
and
solemn
tongue
whose
grandeur
and
solemnity
decrease
as
communities
grow
old
whose
sonorous
tones
ring
in
the
hebrew
bible
and
still
are
noble
in
greece
but
grow
weaker
under
the
progress
of
successive
phases
of
civilization
is
it
to
this
spirit
that
we
owe
the
mysteries
lying
buried
in
every
human
word
in
the
word
do
we
not
discern
a
certain
imaginary
rectitude
does
not
the
compact
brevity
of
its
sound
suggest
a
vague
image
of
chaste
nudity
and
the
simplicity
of
truth
in
all
things
the
syllable
seems
to
me
singularly
crisp
and
fresh
i
chose
the
formula
of
an
abstract
idea
on
purpose
not
wishing
to
illustrate
the
case
by
a
word
which
should
make
it
too
obvious
to
the
apprehension
as
the
word
for
instance
which
is
a
direct
appeal
to
the
senses
but
is
it
not
so
with
every
root
word
they
are
all
stamped
with
a
living
power
that
comes
from
the
soul
and
which
they
restore
to
the
soul
through
the
mysterious
and
wonderful
action
and
reaction
between
thought
and
speech
might
we
not
speak
of
it
as
a
lover
who
finds
on
his
mistress
lips
as
much
love
as
he
gives
thus
by
their
mere
physiognomy
words
call
to
life
in
our
brain
the
beings
which
they
serve
to
clothe
like
all
beings
there
is
but
one
place
where
their
properties
are
at
full
liberty
to
act
and
develop
but
the
subject
demands
a
science
to
itself
perhaps
and
he
would
shrug
his
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
but
we
are
too
high
and
too
low
louis
passion
for
reading
had
on
the
whole
been
very
well
satisfied
the
cure
of
mer
had
two
or
three
thousand
volumes
this
treasure
had
been
derived
from
the
plunder
committed
during
the
revolution
in
the
neighboring
chateaux
and
abbeys
as
a
priest
who
had
taken
the
oath
the
worthy
man
had
been
able
to
choose
the
best
books
from
among
these
precious
libraries
which
were
sold
by
the
pound
in
three
years
louis
lambert
had
assimilated
the
contents
of
all
the
books
in
his
library
that
were
worth
reading
the
process
of
absorbing
ideas
by
means
of
reading
had
become
in
him
a
very
strange
phenomenon
his
eye
took
in
six
or
seven
lines
at
once
and
his
mind
grasped
the
sense
with
a
swiftness
as
remarkable
as
that
of
his
eye
sometimes
even
one
word
in
a
sentence
was
enough
to
enable
him
to
seize
the
gist
of
the
matter
his
memory
was
prodigious
he
remembered
with
equal
exactitude
the
ideas
he
had
derived
from
reading
and
those
which
had
occurred
to
him
in
the
course
of
meditation
or
conversation
indeed
he
had
every
form
of
memory
for
places
for
names
for
words
things
and
faces
he
not
only
recalled
any
object
at
will
but
he
saw
them
in
his
mind
situated
lighted
and
colored
as
he
had
originally
seen
them
and
this
power
he
could
exert
with
equal
effect
with
regard
to
the
most
abstract
efforts
of
the
intellect
he
could
remember
as
he
said
not
merely
the
position
of
a
sentence
in
the
book
where
he
had
met
with
it
but
the
frame
of
mind
he
had
been
in
at
remote
dates
thus
his
was
the
singular
privilege
of
being
able
to
retrace
in
memory
the
whole
life
and
progress
of
his
mind
from
the
ideas
he
had
first
acquired
to
the
last
thought
evolved
in
it
from
the
most
obscure
to
the
clearest
his
brain
accustomed
in
early
youth
to
the
mysterious
mechanism
by
which
human
faculties
are
concentrated
drew
from
this
rich
treasury
endless
images
full
of
life
and
freshness
on
which
he
fed
his
spirit
during
those
lucid
spells
of
contemplation
whenever
i
wish
it
said
he
to
me
in
his
own
language
to
which
a
fund
of
remembrance
gave
precocious
originality
i
can
draw
a
veil
over
my
eyes
then
i
suddenly
see
within
me
a
camera
obscura
where
natural
objects
are
reproduced
in
purer
forms
than
those
under
which
they
first
appeared
to
my
external
sense
at
the
age
of
twelve
his
imagination
stimulated
by
the
perpetual
exercise
of
his
faculties
had
developed
to
a
point
which
permitted
him
to
have
such
precise
concepts
of
things
which
he
knew
only
from
reading
about
them
that
the
image
stamped
on
his
mind
could
not
have
been
clearer
if
he
had
actually
seen
them
whether
this
was
by
a
process
of
analogy
or
that
he
was
gifted
with
a
sort
of
second
sight
by
which
he
could
command
all
nature
when
i
read
the
story
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
said
he
to
me
one
day
i
saw
every
incident
the
roar
of
the
cannon
the
cries
of
the
fighting
men
rang
in
my
ears
and
made
my
inmost
self
quiver
i
could
smell
the
powder
i
heard
the
clatter
of
horses
and
the
voices
of
men
i
looked
down
on
the
plain
where
armed
nations
were
in
collision
just
as
if
i
had
been
on
the
heights
of
santon
the
scene
was
as
terrifying
as
a
passage
from
the
apocalypse
on
the
occasions
when
he
brought
all
his
powers
into
play
and
in
some
degree
lost
consciousness
of
his
physical
existence
and
lived
on
only
by
the
remarkable
energy
of
his
mental
powers
whose
sphere
was
enormously
expanded
he
left
space
behind
him
to
use
his
own
words
but
i
will
not
here
anticipate
the
intellectual
phases
of
his
life
already
in
spite
of
myself
i
have
reversed
the
order
in
which
i
ought
to
tell
the
history
of
this
man
who
transferred
all
his
activities
to
thinking
as
others
throw
all
their
life
into
action
a
strong
bias
drew
his
mind
into
mystical
studies
he
would
say
our
spirit
is
abysmal
and
loves
the
abyss
in
childhood
manhood
and
old
age
we
are
always
eager
for
mysteries
in
whatever
form
they
present
themselves
this
predilection
was
disastrous
if
indeed
his
life
can
be
measured
by
ordinary
standards
or
if
we
may
gauge
another
happiness
by
our
own
or
by
social
notions
this
taste
for
the
things
of
heaven
another
phrase
he
was
fond
of
using
this
was
due
perhaps
to
the
influence
produced
on
his
mind
by
the
first
books
he
read
at
his
uncle
saint
theresa
and
madame
guyon
were
a
sequel
to
the
bible
they
had
the
of
his
manly
intelligence
and
accustomed
him
to
those
swift
reactions
of
the
soul
of
which
ecstasy
is
at
once
the
result
and
the
means
this
line
of
study
this
peculiar
taste
elevated
his
heart
purified
ennobled
it
gave
him
an
appetite
for
the
divine
nature
and
suggested
to
him
the
almost
womanly
refinement
of
feeling
which
is
instinctive
in
great
men
perhaps
their
sublime
superiority
is
no
more
than
the
desire
to
devote
themselves
which
characterizes
woman
only
transferred
to
the
greatest
things
as
a
result
of
these
early
impressions
louis
passed
immaculate
through
his
school
life
this
beautiful
virginity
of
the
senses
naturally
resulted
in
the
richer
fervor
of
his
blood
and
in
increased
faculties
of
mind
the
baroness
de
stael
forbidden
to
come
within
forty
leagues
of
paris
spent
several
months
of
her
banishment
on
an
estate
near
vendome
one
day
when
out
walking
she
met
on
the
skirts
of
the
park
the
son
almost
in
rags
and
absorbed
in
reading
the
book
was
a
translation
of
and
at
that
time
monsieur
monsieur
de
gence
and
a
few
other
french
or
half
german
writers
were
almost
the
only
persons
in
the
french
empire
to
whom
the
name
of
swedenborg
was
known
madame
de
stael
greatly
surprised
took
the
book
from
him
with
the
roughness
she
affected
in
her
questions
looks
and
manners
and
with
a
keen
glance
at
lambert
do
you
understand
all
this
she
asked
do
you
pray
to
god
said
the
child
why
yes
and
do
you
understand
him
the
baroness
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
sat
down
by
lambert
and
began
to
talk
to
him
unfortunately
my
memory
though
retentive
is
far
from
being
so
trustworthy
as
my
friend
and
i
have
forgotten
the
whole
of
the
dialogue
excepting
those
first
words
such
a
meeting
was
of
a
kind
to
strike
madame
de
stael
very
greatly
on
her
return
home
she
said
but
little
about
it
notwithstanding
an
effusiveness
which
in
her
became
mere
loquacity
but
it
evidently
occupied
her
thoughts
the
only
person
now
living
who
preserves
any
recollection
of
the
incident
and
whom
i
catechised
to
be
informed
of
what
few
words
madame
de
stael
had
let
drop
could
with
difficulty
recall
these
words
spoken
by
the
baroness
as
describing
lambert
he
is
a
real
seer
louis
failed
to
justify
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
high
hopes
he
had
inspired
in
his
protectress
the
transient
favor
she
showed
him
was
regarded
as
a
feminine
caprice
one
of
the
fancies
characteristic
of
artist
souls
madame
de
stael
determined
to
save
louis
lambert
alike
from
serving
the
emperor
or
the
church
and
to
preserve
him
for
the
glorious
destiny
which
she
thought
awaited
him
for
she
made
him
out
to
be
a
second
moses
snatched
from
the
waters
before
her
departure
she
instructed
a
friend
of
hers
monsieur
de
corbigny
to
send
her
moses
in
due
course
to
the
high
school
at
vendome
then
she
probably
forgot
him
having
entered
this
college
at
the
age
of
fourteen
early
in
lambert
would
leave
it
at
the
end
of
when
he
had
finished
the
course
of
philosophy
i
doubt
whether
during
the
whole
time
he
ever
heard
a
word
of
his
benefactress
if
indeed
it
was
the
act
of
a
benefactress
to
pay
for
a
lad
schooling
for
three
years
without
a
thought
of
his
future
prospects
after
diverting
him
from
a
career
in
which
he
might
have
found
happiness
the
circumstances
of
the
time
and
louis
lambert
character
may
to
a
great
extent
absolve
madame
de
stael
for
her
thoughtlessness
and
her
generosity
the
gentleman
who
was
to
have
kept
up
communications
between
her
and
the
boy
left
blois
just
at
the
time
when
louis
passed
out
of
the
college
the
political
events
that
ensued
were
then
a
sufficient
excuse
for
this
gentleman
neglect
of
the
baroness
protege
the
authoress
of
heard
no
more
of
her
little
moses
a
hundred
louis
which
she
placed
in
the
hands
of
monsieur
de
corbigny
who
died
i
believe
in
was
not
a
sufficiently
large
sum
to
leave
lasting
memories
in
madame
de
stael
whose
excitable
nature
found
ample
pasture
during
the
vicissitudes
of
and
which
absorbed
all
her
interest
at
this
time
louis
lambert
was
at
once
too
proud
and
too
poor
to
go
in
search
of
a
patroness
who
was
traveling
all
over
europe
however
he
went
on
foot
from
blois
to
paris
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
and
arrived
unluckily
on
the
very
day
of
her
death
two
letters
from
lambert
to
the
baroness
remained
unanswered
the
memory
of
madame
de
stael
good
intentions
with
regard
to
louis
remains
therefore
only
in
some
few
young
minds
struck
as
mine
was
by
the
strangeness
of
the
story
no
one
who
had
not
gone
through
the
training
at
our
college
could
understand
the
effect
usually
made
on
our
minds
by
the
announcement
that
a
new
boy
had
arrived
or
the
impression
that
such
an
adventure
as
louis
lambert
was
calculated
to
produce
and
here
a
little
information
must
be
given
as
to
the
primitive
administration
of
this
institution
originally
and
to
explain
the
new
life
which
there
awaited
lambert
before
the
revolution
the
oratorians
devoted
like
the
society
of
jesus
to
the
education
of
youth
succeeding
the
jesuits
in
fact
in
certain
of
their
establishments
the
colleges
of
vendome
of
tournon
of
la
fleche
sorreze
and
juilly
that
at
vendome
like
the
others
i
believe
turned
out
a
certain
number
of
cadets
for
the
army
the
abolition
of
educational
bodies
decreed
by
the
convention
had
but
little
effect
on
the
college
at
vendome
when
the
first
crisis
had
blown
over
the
authorities
recovered
possession
of
their
buildings
certain
oratorians
scattered
about
the
country
came
back
to
the
college
and
it
under
the
old
rules
with
the
habits
practices
and
customs
which
gave
this
school
a
character
with
which
i
have
seen
nothing
at
all
comparable
in
any
that
i
have
visited
since
i
left
that
establishment
standing
in
the
heart
of
the
town
on
the
little
river
loire
which
flows
under
its
walls
the
college
possesses
extensive
precincts
carefully
enclosed
by
walls
and
including
all
the
buildings
necessary
for
an
institution
on
that
scale
a
chapel
a
theatre
an
infirmary
a
bakehouse
gardens
and
water
supply
this
college
is
the
most
celebrated
home
of
learning
in
all
the
central
provinces
and
receives
pupils
from
them
and
from
the
colonies
distance
prohibits
any
frequent
visits
from
parents
to
their
children
the
rule
of
the
house
forbids
holidays
away
from
it
once
entered
there
a
pupil
never
leaves
till
his
studies
are
finished
with
the
exception
of
walks
taken
under
the
guidance
of
the
fathers
everything
is
calculated
to
give
the
school
the
benefit
of
conventual
discipline
in
my
day
the
tawse
was
still
a
living
memory
and
the
classical
leather
strap
played
its
terrible
part
with
all
the
honors
the
punishment
originally
invented
by
the
society
of
jesus
as
alarming
to
the
moral
as
to
the
physical
man
was
still
in
force
in
all
the
integrity
of
the
original
code
letters
to
parents
were
obligatory
on
certain
days
so
was
confession
thus
our
sins
and
our
sentiments
were
all
according
to
pattern
everything
bore
the
stamp
of
monastic
rule
i
well
remember
among
other
relics
of
the
ancient
order
the
inspection
we
went
through
every
sunday
we
were
all
in
our
best
placed
in
file
like
soldiers
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
two
inspectors
who
attended
by
the
tutors
and
the
tradesmen
examined
us
from
the
three
points
of
view
of
dress
health
and
morals
the
two
or
three
hundred
pupils
lodged
in
the
establishment
were
divided
according
to
ancient
custom
into
the
the
smallest
the
little
boys
the
middle
boys
and
the
big
boys
the
division
of
the
included
the
eighth
and
seventh
classes
the
little
boys
formed
the
sixth
fifth
and
fourth
the
middle
boys
were
classed
as
third
and
second
and
the
first
class
comprised
the
senior
students
of
philosophy
rhetoric
the
higher
mathematics
and
chemistry
each
of
these
divisions
had
its
own
building
classrooms
and
in
the
large
common
precincts
on
to
which
the
classrooms
opened
and
beyond
which
was
the
refectory
this
worthy
of
an
ancient
religious
order
accommodated
all
the
school
contrary
to
the
usual
practice
in
educational
institutions
we
were
allowed
to
talk
at
our
meals
a
tolerant
oratorian
rule
which
enabled
us
to
exchange
plates
according
to
our
taste
this
gastronomical
barter
was
always
one
of
the
chief
pleasures
of
our
college
life
if
one
of
the
middle
boys
at
the
head
of
his
table
wished
for
a
helping
of
lentils
instead
of
dessert
for
we
had
dessert
the
offer
was
passed
down
from
one
to
another
dessert
for
lentils
till
some
other
epicure
had
accepted
then
the
plate
of
lentils
was
passed
up
to
the
bidder
from
hand
to
hand
and
the
plate
of
dessert
returned
by
the
same
road
mistakes
were
never
made
if
several
identical
offers
were
made
they
were
taken
in
order
and
the
formula
would
be
lentils
number
one
for
dessert
number
one
the
tables
were
very
long
our
incessant
barter
kept
everything
moving
we
transacted
it
with
amazing
eagerness
and
the
chatter
of
three
hundred
lads
the
bustling
to
and
fro
of
the
servants
employed
in
changing
the
plates
setting
down
the
dishes
handing
the
bread
with
the
tours
of
inspection
of
the
masters
made
this
refectory
at
vendome
a
scene
unique
in
its
way
and
the
amazement
of
visitors
to
make
our
life
more
tolerable
deprived
as
we
were
of
all
communication
with
the
outer
world
and
of
family
affection
we
were
allowed
to
keep
pigeons
and
to
have
gardens
our
two
or
three
hundred
with
a
thousand
birds
nesting
all
round
the
outer
wall
and
above
thirty
garden
plots
were
a
sight
even
stranger
than
our
meals
but
a
full
account
of
the
peculiarities
which
made
the
college
at
vendome
a
place
unique
in
itself
and
fertile
in
reminiscences
to
those
who
spent
their
boyhood
there
would
be
weariness
to
the
reader
which
of
us
all
but
remembers
with
delight
notwithstanding
the
bitterness
of
learning
the
eccentric
pleasures
of
that
cloistered
life
the
sweetmeats
purchased
by
stealth
in
the
course
of
our
walks
permission
obtained
to
play
cards
and
devise
theatrical
performances
during
the
holidays
such
tricks
and
freedom
as
were
necessitated
by
our
seclusion
then
again
our
military
band
a
relic
of
the
cadets
our
academy
our
chaplain
our
father
professors
and
all
our
games
permitted
or
prohibited
as
the
case
might
be
the
cavalry
charges
on
stilts
the
long
slides
made
in
winter
the
clatter
of
our
clogs
and
above
all
the
trading
transactions
with
the
shop
set
up
in
the
courtyard
itself
this
shop
was
kept
by
a
sort
of
of
whom
big
and
little
boys
could
procure
according
to
his
prospectus
boxes
stilts
tools
jacobin
pigeons
and
nuns
an
article
in
small
demand
penknives
paper
pens
pencils
ink
of
all
colors
balls
and
marbles
in
short
the
whole
catalogue
of
the
most
treasured
possessions
of
boys
including
everything
from
sauce
for
the
pigeons
we
were
obliged
to
kill
off
to
the
earthenware
pots
in
which
we
set
aside
the
rice
from
supper
to
be
eaten
at
next
morning
breakfast
which
of
us
was
so
unhappy
as
to
have
forgotten
how
his
heart
beat
at
the
sight
of
this
booth
open
periodically
during
on
sundays
to
which
we
went
each
in
his
turn
to
spend
his
little
while
the
smallness
of
the
sum
allowed
by
our
parents
for
these
minor
pleasures
required
us
to
make
a
choice
among
all
the
objects
that
appealed
so
strongly
to
our
desires
did
ever
a
young
wife
to
whom
her
husband
during
the
first
days
of
happiness
hands
twelve
times
a
year
a
purse
of
gold
the
budget
of
her
personal
fancies
dream
of
so
many
different
purchases
each
of
which
would
absorb
the
whole
sum
as
we
imagined
possible
on
the
eve
of
the
first
sunday
in
each
month
for
six
francs
during
one
night
we
owned
every
delight
of
that
inexhaustible
shop
and
during
mass
every
response
we
chanted
was
mixed
up
in
our
minds
with
our
secret
calculations
which
of
us
all
can
recollect
ever
having
had
a
sou
left
to
spend
on
the
sunday
following
and
which
of
us
but
obeyed
the
instinctive
law
of
social
existence
by
pitying
helping
and
despising
those
pariahs
who
by
the
avarice
or
poverty
of
their
parents
found
themselves
penniless
any
one
who
forms
a
clear
idea
of
this
huge
college
with
its
monastic
buildings
in
the
heart
of
a
little
town
and
the
four
plots
in
which
we
were
distributed
as
by
a
monastic
rule
will
easily
conceive
of
the
excitement
that
we
felt
at
the
arrival
of
a
new
boy
a
passenger
suddenly
embarked
on
the
ship
no
young
duchess
on
her
first
appearance
at
court
was
ever
more
spitefully
criticised
than
the
new
boy
by
the
youths
in
his
division
usually
during
the
evening
before
prayers
those
sycophants
who
were
accustomed
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
the
fathers
who
took
it
in
turns
two
and
two
for
a
week
to
keep
an
eye
on
us
would
be
the
first
to
hear
on
trustworthy
authority
there
will
be
a
new
boy
and
then
suddenly
the
shout
a
new
boy
a
new
boy
rang
through
the
courts
we
hurried
up
to
crowd
round
the
superintendent
and
pester
him
with
questions
where
was
he
coming
from
what
was
his
name
which
class
would
he
be
in
and
so
forth
louis
lambert
advent
was
the
subject
of
a
romance
worthy
of
the
i
was
in
the
fourth
class
at
the
time
among
the
little
boys
our
housemasters
were
two
men
whom
we
called
fathers
from
habit
and
tradition
though
they
were
not
priests
in
my
time
there
were
indeed
but
three
genuine
oratorians
to
whom
this
title
legitimately
belonged
in
they
all
left
the
college
which
had
gradually
become
secularized
to
find
occupation
about
the
altar
in
various
country
parishes
like
the
cure
of
mer
father
haugoult
the
master
for
the
week
was
not
a
bad
man
but
of
very
moderate
attainments
and
he
lacked
the
tact
which
is
indispensable
for
discerning
the
different
characters
of
children
and
graduating
their
punishment
to
their
powers
of
resistance
father
haugoult
then
began
very
obligingly
to
communicate
to
his
pupils
the
wonderful
events
which
were
to
end
on
the
morrow
in
the
advent
of
the
most
singular
of
new
boys
games
were
at
an
end
all
the
children
came
round
in
silence
to
hear
the
story
of
louis
lambert
discovered
like
an
aerolite
by
madame
de
stael
in
a
corner
of
the
wood
monsieur
haugoult
had
to
tell
us
all
about
madame
de
stael
that
evening
she
seemed
to
me
ten
feet
high
i
saw
at
a
later
time
the
picture
of
corinne
in
which
gerard
represents
her
as
so
tall
and
handsome
and
alas
the
woman
painted
by
my
imagination
so
far
transcended
this
that
the
real
madame
de
stael
fell
at
once
in
my
estimation
even
after
i
read
her
book
of
really
masculine
power
but
lambert
at
that
time
was
an
even
greater
wonder
monsieur
mareschal
the
headmaster
after
examining
him
had
thought
of
placing
him
among
the
senior
boys
it
was
louis
ignorance
of
latin
that
placed
him
so
low
as
the
fourth
class
but
he
would
certainly
leap
up
a
class
every
year
and
as
a
remarkable
exception
he
was
to
be
one
of
the
academy
we
were
to
have
the
honor
of
counting
among
the
little
boys
one
whose
coat
was
adorned
with
the
red
ribbon
displayed
by
the
academicians
of
vendome
these
academicians
enjoyed
distinguished
privileges
they
often
dined
at
the
director
table
and
held
two
literary
meetings
annually
at
which
we
were
all
present
to
hear
their
elucubrations
an
academician
was
a
great
man
in
embryo
and
if
every
vendome
scholar
would
speak
the
truth
he
would
confess
that
in
later
life
an
academician
of
the
great
french
academy
seemed
to
him
far
less
remarkable
than
the
stupendous
boy
who
wore
the
cross
and
the
imposing
red
ribbon
which
were
the
insignia
of
our
academy
it
was
very
unusual
to
be
one
of
that
illustrious
body
before
attaining
to
the
second
class
for
the
academicians
were
expected
to
hold
public
meetings
every
thursday
during
the
holidays
and
to
read
tales
in
verse
or
prose
epistles
essays
tragedies
dramas
compositions
far
above
the
intelligence
of
the
lower
classes
i
long
treasured
the
memory
of
a
story
called
the
green
ass
which
was
i
think
the
masterpiece
of
this
unknown
society
in
the
fourth
and
an
academician
this
boy
of
fourteen
a
poet
already
the
protege
of
madame
de
stael
a
coming
genius
said
father
haugoult
was
to
be
one
of
us
a
wizard
a
youth
capable
of
writing
a
composition
or
a
translation
while
we
were
being
called
into
lessons
and
of
learning
his
lessons
by
reading
them
through
but
once
louis
lambert
bewildered
all
our
ideas
and
father
curiosity
and
impatience
to
see
this
new
boy
added
fuel
to
our
excited
fancy
if
he
has
pigeons
he
can
have
no
there
is
not
room
for
another
well
it
can
not
be
helped
said
one
boy
since
famous
as
an
agriculturist
who
will
sit
next
to
him
said
another
oh
i
wish
i
might
be
his
chum
cried
an
enthusiast
in
school
language
the
word
here
rendered
chum
or
in
some
schools
expressed
a
fraternal
sharing
of
the
joys
and
evils
of
your
childish
existence
a
community
of
interests
that
was
fruitful
of
squabbling
and
making
friends
again
a
treaty
of
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
it
is
strange
but
never
in
my
time
did
i
know
brothers
who
were
chums
if
man
lives
by
his
feelings
he
thinks
perhaps
that
he
will
make
his
life
the
poorer
if
he
merges
an
affection
of
his
own
choosing
in
a
natural
tie
the
impression
made
upon
me
by
father
haugoult
harangue
that
evening
is
one
of
the
most
vivid
reminiscences
of
my
childhood
i
can
compare
it
with
nothing
but
my
first
reading
of
indeed
i
owe
to
my
recollection
of
these
prodigious
impressions
an
observation
that
may
perhaps
be
new
as
to
the
different
sense
attached
to
words
by
each
hearer
the
word
in
itself
has
no
final
meaning
we
affect
a
word
more
than
it
affects
us
its
value
is
in
relation
to
the
images
we
have
assimilated
and
grouped
round
it
but
a
study
of
this
fact
would
require
considerable
elaboration
and
lead
us
too
far
from
our
immediate
subject
not
being
able
to
sleep
i
had
a
long
discussion
with
my
next
neighbor
in
the
dormitory
as
to
the
remarkable
being
who
on
the
morrow
was
to
be
one
of
us
this
neighbor
who
became
an
officer
and
is
now
a
writer
with
lofty
philosophical
views
barchou
de
penhoen
has
not
been
false
to
his
nor
to
the
hazard
of
fortune
by
which
the
only
two
scholars
of
vendome
of
whose
fame
vendome
ever
hears
were
brought
together
in
the
same
classroom
on
the
same
form
and
under
the
same
roof
our
comrade
dufaure
had
not
when
this
book
was
published
made
his
appearance
in
public
life
as
a
lawyer
the
translator
of
fichte
the
expositor
and
friend
of
ballanche
was
already
interested
as
i
myself
was
in
metaphysical
questions
we
often
talked
nonsense
together
about
god
ourselves
and
nature
he
at
that
time
affected
pyrrhonism
jealous
of
his
place
as
leader
he
doubted
lambert
precocious
gifts
while
i
having
lately
read
enfants
overwhelmed
him
with
evidence
quoting
young
montcalm
pico
della
mirandola
pascal
in
short
a
score
of
early
developed
brains
anomalies
that
are
famous
in
the
history
of
the
human
mind
and
lambert
predecessors
i
was
at
the
time
passionately
addicted
to
reading
my
father
who
was
ambitious
to
see
me
in
the
ecole
polytechnique
paid
for
me
to
have
a
special
course
of
private
lessons
in
mathematics
my
mathematical
master
was
the
librarian
of
the
college
and
allowed
me
to
help
myself
to
books
without
much
caring
what
i
chose
to
take
from
the
library
a
quiet
spot
where
i
went
to
him
during
to
have
my
lesson
either
he
was
no
great
mathematician
or
he
was
absorbed
in
some
grand
scheme
for
he
very
willingly
left
me
to
read
when
i
ought
to
have
been
learning
while
he
worked
at
i
knew
not
what
so
by
a
tacit
understanding
between
us
i
made
no
complaints
of
being
taught
nothing
and
he
said
nothing
of
the
books
i
borrowed
carried
away
by
this
mania
i
neglected
my
studies
to
compose
poems
which
certainly
can
have
shown
no
great
promise
to
judge
by
a
line
of
too
many
feet
which
became
famous
among
my
companions
the
beginning
of
an
epic
on
the
incas
o
inca
o
roi
infortune
et
malheureux
in
derision
of
such
attempts
i
was
nicknamed
the
poet
but
mockery
did
not
cure
me
i
was
always
rhyming
in
spite
of
good
advice
from
monsieur
mareschal
the
headmaster
who
tried
to
cure
me
of
an
unfortunately
inveterate
passion
by
telling
me
the
fable
of
a
linnet
that
fell
out
of
the
nest
because
it
tried
to
fly
before
its
wings
were
grown
i
persisted
in
my
reading
i
became
the
least
emulous
the
idlest
the
most
dreamy
of
all
the
division
of
little
boys
and
consequently
the
most
frequently
punished
this
autobiographical
digression
may
give
some
idea
of
the
reflections
i
was
led
to
make
in
anticipation
of
lambert
arrival
i
was
then
twelve
years
old
i
felt
sympathy
from
the
first
for
the
boy
whose
temperament
had
some
points
of
likeness
to
my
own
i
was
at
last
to
have
a
companion
in
daydreams
and
meditations
though
i
knew
not
yet
what
glory
meant
i
thought
it
glory
to
be
the
familiar
friend
of
a
child
whose
immortality
was
foreseen
by
madame
de
stael
to
me
louis
lambert
was
as
a
giant
the
morrow
came
at
last
a
minute
before
breakfast
we
heard
the
steps
of
monsieur
mareschal
and
of
the
new
boy
in
the
quiet
courtyard
every
head
was
turned
at
once
to
the
door
of
the
classroom
father
haugoult
who
participated
in
our
torments
of
curiosity
did
not
sound
the
whistle
he
used
to
reduce
our
mutterings
to
silence
and
bring
us
back
to
our
tasks
we
then
saw
this
famous
new
boy
whom
monsieur
mareschal
was
leading
by
the
hand
the
superintendent
descended
from
his
desk
and
the
headmaster
said
to
him
solemnly
according
to
etiquette
monsieur
i
have
brought
you
monsieur
louis
lambert
will
you
place
him
in
the
fourth
class
he
will
begin
work
then
after
speaking
a
few
words
in
an
undertone
to
the
he
said
where
can
he
sit
it
would
have
been
unfair
to
displace
one
of
us
for
a
newcomer
so
as
there
was
but
one
desk
vacant
louis
lambert
came
to
fill
it
next
to
me
for
i
had
last
joined
the
class
though
we
still
had
some
time
to
wait
before
lessons
were
over
we
all
stood
up
to
look
at
louis
lambert
monsieur
mareschal
heard
our
mutterings
saw
how
eager
we
were
and
said
with
the
kindness
that
endeared
him
to
us
all
well
well
but
make
no
noise
do
not
disturb
the
other
classes
these
words
set
us
free
to
play
some
little
time
before
breakfast
and
we
all
gathered
round
lambert
while
monsieur
mareschal
walked
up
and
down
the
courtyard
with
father
haugoult
there
were
about
eighty
of
us
little
demons
as
bold
as
birds
of
prey
though
we
ourselves
had
all
gone
through
this
cruel
novitiate
we
showed
no
mercy
on
a
newcomer
never
sparing
him
the
mockery
the
catechism
the
impertinence
which
were
inexhaustible
on
such
occasions
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
neophyte
whose
manners
strength
and
temper
were
thus
tested
lambert
whether
he
was
stoical
or
dumfounded
made
no
reply
to
any
questions
one
of
us
thereupon
remarked
that
he
was
no
doubt
of
the
school
of
pythagoras
and
there
was
a
shout
of
laughter
the
new
boy
was
thenceforth
pythagoras
through
all
his
life
at
the
college
at
the
same
time
lambert
piercing
eye
the
scorn
expressed
in
his
face
for
our
childishness
so
far
removed
from
the
stamp
of
his
own
nature
the
easy
attitude
he
assumed
and
his
evident
strength
in
proportion
to
his
years
infused
a
certain
respect
into
the
veriest
scamps
among
us
for
my
part
i
kept
near
him
absorbed
in
studying
him
in
silence
louis
lambert
was
slightly
built
nearly
five
feet
in
height
his
face
was
tanned
and
his
hands
were
burnt
brown
by
the
sun
giving
him
an
appearance
of
manly
vigor
which
in
fact
he
did
not
possess
indeed
two
months
after
he
came
to
the
college
when
studying
in
the
classroom
had
faded
his
vivid
so
to
speak
vegetable
coloring
he
became
as
pale
and
white
as
a
woman
his
head
was
unusually
large
his
hair
of
a
fine
bright
black
in
masses
of
curls
gave
wonderful
beauty
to
his
brow
of
which
the
proportions
were
extraordinary
even
to
us
heedless
boys
knowing
nothing
as
may
be
supposed
of
the
auguries
of
phrenology
a
science
still
in
its
cradle
the
distinction
of
this
prophetic
brow
lay
principally
in
the
exquisitely
chiseled
shape
of
the
arches
under
which
his
black
eyes
sparkled
and
which
had
the
transparency
of
alabaster
the
line
having
the
unusual
beauty
of
being
perfectly
level
to
where
it
met
the
top
of
the
nose
but
when
you
saw
his
eyes
it
was
difficult
to
think
of
the
rest
of
his
face
which
was
indeed
plain
enough
for
their
look
was
full
of
a
wonderful
variety
of
expression
they
seemed
to
have
a
soul
in
their
depths
at
one
moment
astonishingly
clear
and
piercing
at
another
full
of
heavenly
sweetness
those
eyes
became
dull
almost
colorless
as
it
seemed
when
he
was
lost
in
meditation
they
then
looked
like
a
window
from
which
the
sun
had
suddenly
vanished
after
lighting
it
up
his
strength
and
his
voice
were
no
less
variable
equally
rigid
equally
unexpected
his
tone
could
be
as
sweet
as
that
of
a
woman
compelled
to
own
her
love
at
other
times
it
was
labored
rough
rugged
if
i
may
use
such
words
in
a
new
sense
as
to
his
strength
he
was
habitually
incapable
of
enduring
the
fatigue
of
any
game
and
seemed
weakly
almost
infirm
but
during
the
early
days
of
his
one
of
our
little
bullies
having
made
game
of
this
sickliness
which
rendered
him
unfit
for
the
violent
exercise
in
vogue
among
his
fellows
lambert
took
hold
with
both
hands
of
one
of
the
consisting
of
twelve
large
desks
face
to
face
and
sloping
from
the
middle
he
leaned
back
against
the
desk
steadying
the
table
with
his
feet
on
the
below
and
said
now
ten
of
you
try
to
move
it
i
was
present
and
can
vouch
for
this
strange
display
of
strength
it
was
impossible
to
move
the
table
lambert
had
the
gift
of
summoning
to
his
aid
at
certain
times
the
most
extraordinary
powers
and
of
concentrating
all
his
forces
on
a
given
point
but
children
like
men
are
wont
to
judge
of
everything
by
first
impressions
and
after
the
first
few
days
we
ceased
to
study
louis
he
entirely
belied
madame
de
stael
prognostications
and
displayed
none
of
the
prodigies
we
looked
for
in
him
after
three
months
at
school
louis
was
looked
upon
as
a
quite
ordinary
scholar
i
alone
was
allowed
really
to
know
that
sublime
why
should
i
not
say
divine
soul
for
what
is
nearer
to
god
than
genius
in
the
heart
of
a
child
the
similarity
of
our
tastes
and
ideas
made
us
friends
and
chums
our
intimacy
was
so
brotherly
that
our
joined
our
two
names
one
was
never
spoken
without
the
other
and
to
call
either
they
always
shouted
some
other
names
had
been
known
coupled
in
a
like
manner
thus
for
two
years
i
was
the
school
friend
of
poor
louis
lambert
and
during
that
time
my
life
was
so
identified
with
his
that
i
am
enabled
now
to
write
his
intellectual
biography
it
was
long
before
i
fully
knew
the
poetry
and
the
wealth
of
ideas
that
lay
hidden
in
my
companion
heart
and
brain
it
was
not
till
i
was
thirty
years
of
age
till
my
experience
was
matured
and
condensed
till
the
flash
of
an
intense
illumination
had
thrown
a
fresh
light
upon
it
that
i
was
capable
of
understanding
all
the
bearings
of
the
phenomena
which
i
witnessed
at
that
early
time
i
benefited
by
them
without
understanding
their
greatness
or
their
processes
indeed
i
have
forgotten
some
or
remember
only
the
most
conspicuous
facts
still
my
memory
is
now
able
to
them
and
i
have
mastered
the
secrets
of
that
fertile
brain
by
looking
back
to
the
delightful
days
of
our
boyish
affection
so
it
was
time
alone
that
initiated
me
into
the
meaning
of
the
events
and
facts
that
were
crowded
into
that
obscure
life
as
into
that
of
many
another
man
who
is
lost
to
science
indeed
this
narrative
so
far
as
the
expression
and
appreciation
of
many
things
is
concerned
will
be
found
full
of
what
may
be
termed
moral
anachronisms
which
perhaps
will
not
detract
from
its
peculiar
interest
in
the
course
of
the
first
few
months
after
coming
to
vendome
louis
became
the
victim
of
a
malady
which
though
the
symptoms
were
invisible
to
the
eye
of
our
superiors
considerably
interfered
with
the
exercise
of
his
remarkable
gifts
accustomed
to
live
in
the
open
air
and
to
the
freedom
of
a
purely
haphazard
education
happy
in
the
tender
care
of
an
old
man
who
was
devoted
to
him
used
to
meditating
in
the
sunshine
he
found
it
very
hard
to
submit
to
college
rules
to
walk
in
the
ranks
to
live
within
the
four
walls
of
a
room
where
eighty
boys
were
sitting
in
silence
on
wooden
forms
each
in
front
of
his
desk
his
senses
were
developed
to
such
perfection
as
gave
them
the
most
sensitive
keenness
and
every
part
of
him
suffered
from
this
life
in
common
the
effluvia
that
vitiated
the
air
mingled
with
the
odors
of
a
classroom
that
was
never
clean
nor
free
from
the
fragments
of
our
breakfasts
or
snacks
affected
his
sense
of
smell
the
sense
which
being
more
immediately
connected
than
the
others
with
the
of
the
brain
must
when
shocked
cause
invisible
disturbance
to
the
organs
of
thought
besides
these
elements
of
impurity
in
the
atmosphere
there
were
lockers
in
the
classrooms
in
which
the
boys
kept
their
miscellaneous
plunder
pigeons
killed
for
fete
days
or
tidbits
filched
from
the
in
each
classroom
too
there
was
a
large
stone
slab
on
which
two
pails
full
of
water
were
kept
standing
a
sort
of
sink
where
we
every
morning
washed
our
faces
and
hands
one
after
another
in
the
master
presence
we
then
passed
on
to
a
table
where
women
combed
and
powdered
our
hair
thus
the
place
being
cleaned
but
once
a
day
before
we
were
up
was
always
more
or
less
dirty
in
spite
of
numerous
windows
and
lofty
doors
the
air
was
constantly
fouled
by
the
smells
from
the
the
hairdressing
the
lockers
and
the
thousand
messes
made
by
the
boys
to
say
nothing
of
their
eighty
closely
packed
bodies
and
this
sort
of
mingling
with
the
mud
we
brought
in
from
the
produced
a
suffocatingly
pestilent
the
loss
of
the
fresh
and
fragrant
country
air
in
which
he
had
hitherto
lived
the
change
of
habits
and
strict
discipline
combined
to
depress
lambert
with
his
elbow
on
his
desk
and
his
head
supported
on
his
left
hand
he
spent
the
hours
of
study
gazing
at
the
trees
in
the
court
or
the
clouds
in
the
sky
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
his
lessons
but
the
master
seeing
his
pen
motionless
or
the
sheet
before
him
still
a
blank
would
call
out
lambert
you
are
doing
nothing
this
are
doing
was
a
that
wounded
louis
to
the
quick
and
then
he
never
earned
the
rest
of
the
he
always
had
impositions
to
write
the
imposition
a
punishment
which
varies
according
to
the
practice
of
different
schools
consisted
at
vendome
of
a
certain
number
of
lines
to
be
written
out
in
play
hours
lambert
and
i
were
so
overpowered
with
impositions
that
we
had
not
six
free
days
during
the
two
years
of
our
school
friendship
but
for
the
books
we
took
out
of
the
library
which
maintained
some
vitality
in
our
brains
this
system
of
discipline
would
have
reduced
us
to
idiotcy
want
of
exercise
is
fatal
to
children
the
habit
of
preserving
a
dignified
appearance
begun
in
tender
infancy
has
it
is
said
a
visible
effect
on
the
constitution
of
royal
personages
when
the
faults
of
such
an
education
are
not
counteracted
by
the
life
of
the
or
the
laborious
sport
of
hunting
and
if
the
laws
of
etiquette
and
court
manners
can
act
on
the
spinal
marrow
to
such
an
extent
as
to
affect
the
pelvis
of
kings
to
soften
their
cerebral
tissue
and
so
degenerate
the
race
what
mischief
physical
and
moral
must
result
in
schoolboys
from
the
constant
lack
of
air
exercise
and
cheerfulness
indeed
the
rules
of
punishment
carried
out
in
schools
deserve
the
attention
of
the
office
of
public
instruction
when
any
thinkers
are
to
be
found
there
who
do
not
think
exclusively
of
themselves
we
incurred
the
infliction
of
an
imposition
in
a
thousand
ways
our
memory
was
so
good
that
we
never
learned
a
lesson
it
was
enough
for
either
of
us
to
hear
our
repeat
the
task
in
french
latin
or
grammar
and
we
could
say
it
when
our
turn
came
but
if
the
master
unfortunately
took
it
into
his
head
to
reverse
the
usual
order
and
call
upon
us
first
we
very
often
did
not
even
know
what
the
lesson
was
then
the
imposition
fell
in
spite
of
our
most
ingenious
excuses
then
we
always
put
off
writing
our
exercises
till
the
last
moment
if
there
were
a
book
to
be
finished
or
if
we
were
lost
in
thought
the
task
was
forgotten
again
an
imposition
how
often
have
we
scribbled
an
exercise
during
the
time
when
the
whose
business
it
was
to
collect
them
when
we
came
into
school
was
gathering
them
from
the
others
in
addition
to
the
moral
misery
which
lambert
went
through
in
trying
to
acclimatize
himself
to
college
life
there
was
a
scarcely
less
cruel
apprenticeship
through
which
every
boy
had
to
pass
to
those
bodily
sufferings
which
seemed
infinitely
varied
the
tenderness
of
a
skin
needs
extreme
care
especially
in
winter
when
a
is
constantly
exchanging
the
frozen
air
of
the
muddy
for
the
stuffy
atmosphere
of
the
classroom
the
little
boys
and
the
smallest
of
all
for
lack
of
a
mother
care
were
martyrs
to
chilblains
and
chaps
so
severe
that
they
had
to
be
regularly
dressed
during
the
breakfast
hour
but
this
could
only
be
very
indifferently
done
to
so
many
damaged
hands
toes
and
heels
a
good
many
of
the
boys
indeed
were
obliged
to
prefer
the
evil
to
the
remedy
the
choice
constantly
lay
between
their
lessons
waiting
to
be
finished
or
the
joys
of
a
slide
and
waiting
for
a
bandage
carelessly
put
on
and
still
more
carelessly
cast
off
again
also
it
was
the
fashion
in
the
school
to
gibe
at
the
poor
feeble
creatures
who
went
to
be
doctored
the
bullies
vied
with
each
other
in
snatching
off
the
rags
which
the
infirmary
nurse
had
tied
on
hence
in
winter
many
of
us
with
feet
and
fingers
sick
with
pain
were
incapable
of
work
and
punished
for
not
working
the
fathers
too
often
deluded
by
shammed
ailments
would
not
believe
in
real
suffering
the
price
paid
for
our
schooling
and
board
also
covered
the
cost
of
clothing
the
committee
contracted
for
the
shoes
and
clothes
supplied
to
the
boys
hence
the
weekly
inspection
of
which
i
have
spoken
this
plan
though
admirable
for
the
manager
is
always
disastrous
to
the
managed
woe
to
the
boy
who
indulged
in
the
bad
habit
of
treading
his
shoes
down
at
heel
of
cracking
the
or
wearing
out
the
soles
too
fast
whether
from
a
defect
in
his
gait
or
by
fidgeting
during
lessons
in
obedience
to
the
instinctive
need
of
movement
common
to
all
children
that
boy
did
not
get
through
the
winter
without
great
suffering
in
the
first
place
his
chilblains
would
ache
and
shot
as
badly
as
a
fit
of
the
gout
then
the
rivets
and
intended
to
repair
the
shoes
would
give
way
or
the
broken
heels
would
prevent
the
wretched
shoes
from
keeping
on
his
feet
he
was
obliged
to
drag
them
wearily
along
the
frozen
roads
or
sometimes
to
dispute
their
possession
with
the
clay
soil
of
the
district
the
water
and
snow
got
in
through
some
unnoticed
crack
or
patch
and
the
foot
would
swell
out
of
sixty
boys
not
ten
perhaps
could
walk
without
some
special
form
of
torture
and
yet
they
all
kept
up
with
the
body
of
the
troop
dragged
on
by
the
general
movement
as
men
are
driven
through
life
by
life
itself
many
a
time
some
boy
would
shed
tears
of
rage
while
summoning
his
remaining
energy
to
run
ahead
and
get
home
again
in
spite
of
pain
so
sensitively
afraid
of
laughter
or
of
pity
two
forms
of
scorn
is
the
still
tender
soul
at
that
age
at
school
as
in
social
life
the
strong
despise
the
feeble
without
knowing
in
what
true
strength
consists
nor
was
this
all
no
gloves
if
by
good
hap
a
boy
parents
the
infirmary
nurse
or
the
headmaster
gave
gloves
to
a
particularly
delicate
lad
the
wags
or
the
big
boys
of
the
class
would
put
them
on
the
stove
amused
to
see
them
dry
and
shrivel
or
if
the
gloves
escaped
the
marauders
after
getting
wet
they
shrunk
as
they
dried
for
want
of
care
no
gloves
were
impossible
gloves
were
a
privilege
and
boys
insist
on
equality
louis
lambert
fell
a
victim
to
all
these
varieties
of
torment
like
many
contemplative
men
who
when
lost
in
thought
acquire
a
habit
of
mechanical
motion
he
had
a
mania
for
fidgeting
with
his
shoes
and
destroyed
them
very
quickly
his
girlish
complexion
the
skin
of
his
ears
and
lips
cracked
with
the
least
cold
his
soft
white
hands
grew
red
and
swollen
he
had
perpetual
colds
thus
he
was
a
constant
sufferer
till
he
became
inured
to
taught
at
last
by
cruel
experience
he
was
obliged
to
look
after
his
things
to
use
the
school
phrase
he
was
forced
to
take
care
of
his
locker
his
desk
his
clothes
his
shoes
to
protect
his
ink
his
books
his
and
his
pens
from
pilferers
in
short
to
give
his
mind
to
the
thousand
details
of
our
trivial
life
to
which
more
selfish
and
commonplace
minds
devoted
such
strict
attention
thus
infallibly
securing
prizes
for
proficiency
and
good
conduct
while
they
were
overlooked
by
a
boy
of
the
highest
promise
who
under
the
hand
of
an
almost
divine
imagination
gave
himself
up
with
rapture
to
the
flow
of
his
ideas
this
was
not
all
there
is
a
perpetual
struggle
going
on
between
the
masters
and
the
boys
a
struggle
without
truce
to
be
compared
with
nothing
else
in
the
social
world
unless
it
be
the
resistance
of
the
opposition
to
the
ministry
in
a
representative
government
but
journalists
and
opposition
speakers
are
probably
less
prompt
to
take
advantage
of
a
weak
point
less
extreme
in
resenting
an
injury
and
less
merciless
in
their
mockery
than
boys
are
in
regard
to
those
who
rule
over
them
it
is
a
task
to
put
angels
out
of
patience
an
unhappy
must
then
not
be
too
severely
blamed
as
he
is
and
consequently
not
too
competent
if
he
is
occasionally
unjust
or
out
of
temper
perpetually
watched
by
a
hundred
mocking
eyes
and
surrounded
with
snares
he
sometimes
revenges
himself
for
his
own
blunders
on
the
boys
who
are
only
too
ready
to
detect
them
unless
for
serious
misdemeanors
for
which
there
were
other
forms
of
punishment
the
strap
was
regarded
at
vendome
as
the
ratio
exercises
forgotten
lessons
ill
learned
common
ill
behavior
were
sufficiently
punished
by
an
imposition
but
offended
dignity
spoke
in
the
master
through
the
strap
of
all
the
physical
torments
to
which
we
were
exposed
certainly
the
most
acute
was
that
inflicted
by
this
leathern
instrument
about
two
fingers
wide
applied
to
our
poor
little
hands
with
all
the
strength
and
all
the
fury
of
the
administrator
to
endure
this
classical
form
of
correction
the
victim
knelt
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
had
to
leave
his
form
and
go
to
kneel
down
near
the
master
desk
under
the
curious
and
generally
merciless
eyes
of
his
fellows
to
sensitive
natures
these
preliminaries
were
an
introductory
torture
like
the
journey
from
the
palais
de
justice
to
the
place
de
greve
which
the
condemned
used
to
make
to
the
scaffold
some
boys
cried
out
and
shed
bitter
tears
before
or
after
the
application
of
the
strap
others
accepted
the
infliction
with
stoic
calm
it
was
a
question
of
nature
but
few
could
control
an
expression
of
anguish
in
anticipation
louis
lambert
was
constantly
enduring
the
strap
and
owed
it
to
a
peculiarity
of
his
physiognomy
of
which
he
was
for
a
long
time
quite
unconscious
whenever
he
was
suddenly
roused
from
a
fit
of
abstraction
by
the
master
cry
you
are
doing
nothing
it
often
happened
that
without
knowing
it
he
flashed
at
his
teacher
a
look
full
of
fierce
contempt
and
charged
with
thought
as
a
leyden
jar
is
charged
with
electricity
this
look
no
doubt
discomfited
the
master
who
indignant
at
this
unspoken
retort
wished
to
cure
his
scholar
of
that
thunderous
flash
the
first
time
the
father
took
offence
at
this
ray
of
scorn
which
struck
him
like
a
he
made
this
speech
as
i
well
remember
if
you
look
at
me
again
in
that
way
lambert
you
will
get
the
strap
at
these
words
every
nose
was
in
the
air
every
eye
looked
alternately
at
the
master
and
at
louis
the
observation
was
so
utterly
foolish
that
the
boy
again
looked
at
the
father
overwhelming
him
with
another
flash
from
this
arose
a
standing
feud
between
lambert
and
his
master
resulting
in
a
certain
amount
of
strap
thus
did
he
first
discover
the
power
of
his
eye
the
hapless
poet
so
full
of
nerves
as
sensitive
as
a
woman
under
the
sway
of
chronic
melancholy
and
as
sick
with
genius
as
a
girl
with
love
that
she
pines
for
knowing
nothing
of
it
this
boy
at
once
so
powerful
and
so
weak
transplanted
by
corinne
from
the
country
he
loved
to
be
squeezed
in
the
mould
of
a
collegiate
routine
to
which
every
spirit
and
every
body
must
yield
whatever
their
range
or
temperament
accepting
its
rule
and
its
uniform
as
gold
is
crushed
into
round
coin
under
the
press
louis
lambert
suffered
in
every
spot
where
pain
can
touch
the
soul
or
the
flesh
stuck
on
a
form
restricted
to
the
acreage
of
his
desk
a
victim
of
the
strap
and
to
a
sickly
frame
tortured
in
every
sense
environed
by
distress
everything
compelled
him
to
give
his
body
up
to
the
myriad
tyrannies
of
school
life
and
like
the
martyrs
who
smiled
in
the
midst
of
suffering
he
took
refuge
in
heaven
which
lay
open
to
his
mind
perhaps
this
life
of
purely
inward
emotions
helped
him
to
see
something
of
the
mysteries
he
so
entirely
believed
in
our
independence
our
illicit
amusements
our
apparent
waste
of
time
our
persistent
indifference
our
frequent
punishments
and
aversion
for
our
exercises
and
impositions
earned
us
a
reputation
which
no
one
cared
to
controvert
for
being
an
idle
and
incorrigible
pair
our
masters
treated
us
with
contempt
and
we
fell
into
utter
disgrace
with
our
companions
from
whom
we
concealed
our
secret
studies
for
fear
of
being
laughed
at
this
hard
judgment
which
was
injustice
in
the
masters
was
but
natural
in
our
schoolfellows
we
could
neither
play
ball
nor
run
races
nor
walk
on
stilts
on
exceptional
holidays
when
amnesty
was
proclaimed
and
we
got
a
few
hours
of
freedom
we
shared
in
none
of
the
popular
diversions
of
the
school
aliens
from
the
pleasures
enjoyed
by
the
others
we
were
outcasts
sitting
forlorn
under
a
tree
in
the
the
formed
an
exception
and
led
a
life
apart
from
the
life
of
the
rest
the
penetrating
instinct
and
unerring
conceit
of
schoolboys
made
them
feel
that
we
were
of
a
nature
either
far
above
or
far
beneath
their
own
hence
some
simply
hated
our
aristocratic
reserve
others
merely
scorned
our
ineptitude
these
feelings
were
equally
shared
by
us
without
our
knowing
it
perhaps
i
have
but
now
divined
them
we
lived
exactly
like
two
rats
huddled
into
the
corner
of
the
room
where
our
desks
were
sitting
there
alike
during
lesson
time
and
play
hours
this
strange
state
of
affairs
inevitably
and
in
fact
placed
us
on
a
footing
of
war
with
all
the
other
boys
in
our
division
forgotten
for
the
most
part
we
sat
there
very
contentedly
half
happy
like
two
plants
two
images
who
would
have
been
missed
from
the
furniture
of
the
room
but
the
most
aggressive
of
our
schoolfellows
would
sometimes
torment
us
just
to
show
their
malignant
power
and
we
responded
with
stolid
contempt
which
brought
many
a
thrashing
down
on
the
lambert
lasted
for
many
months
i
know
no
words
to
describe
the
dejection
to
which
he
was
a
prey
louis
has
taken
the
glory
off
many
a
masterpiece
for
me
we
had
both
played
the
part
of
the
leper
of
aosta
and
had
both
experienced
the
feelings
described
in
monsieur
de
maistre
story
before
we
read
them
as
expressed
by
his
eloquent
pen
a
book
may
indeed
revive
the
memories
of
our
childhood
but
it
can
never
compete
with
them
successfully
lambert
woes
had
taught
me
many
a
chant
of
sorrow
far
more
appealing
than
the
finest
passages
in
werther
and
indeed
there
is
no
possible
comparison
between
the
pangs
of
a
passion
condemned
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
by
every
law
and
the
grief
of
a
poor
child
pining
for
the
glorious
sunshine
the
dews
of
the
valley
and
liberty
werther
is
the
slave
of
desire
louis
lambert
was
an
enslaved
soul
given
equal
talent
the
more
pathetic
sorrow
founded
on
desires
which
being
purer
are
the
more
genuine
must
transcend
the
wail
even
of
genius
after
sitting
for
a
long
time
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
in
the
playground
louis
would
say
just
a
word
but
that
word
would
reveal
an
infinite
speculation
happily
for
me
he
exclaimed
one
day
there
are
hours
of
comfort
when
i
feel
as
though
the
walls
of
the
room
had
fallen
and
i
were
away
away
in
the
fields
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
let
oneself
go
on
the
stream
of
one
thoughts
as
a
bird
is
borne
up
on
its
wings
why
is
green
a
color
so
largely
diffused
throughout
creation
he
would
ask
me
why
are
there
so
few
straight
lines
in
nature
why
is
it
that
man
in
his
structures
rarely
introduces
curves
why
is
it
that
he
alone
of
all
creatures
has
a
sense
of
straightness
these
queries
revealed
long
excursions
in
space
he
had
i
am
sure
seen
vast
landscapes
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
woods
he
was
always
silent
and
resigned
a
living
elegy
always
suffering
but
unable
to
complain
of
suffering
an
eagle
that
needed
the
world
to
feed
him
shut
in
between
four
narrow
dirty
walls
and
thus
this
life
became
an
ideal
life
in
the
strictest
meaning
of
the
words
filled
as
he
was
with
contempt
of
the
almost
useless
studies
to
which
we
were
harnessed
louis
went
on
his
skyward
way
absolutely
unconscious
of
the
things
about
us
i
obeying
the
imitative
instinct
that
is
so
strong
in
childhood
tired
to
regulate
my
life
in
conformity
with
his
and
louis
the
more
easily
infected
me
with
the
sort
of
torpor
in
which
deep
contemplation
leaves
the
body
because
i
was
younger
and
more
impressionable
than
he
like
two
lovers
we
got
into
the
habit
of
thinking
together
in
a
common
reverie
his
intuitions
had
already
acquired
that
acuteness
which
must
surely
characterize
the
intellectual
perceptiveness
of
great
poets
and
often
bring
them
to
the
verge
of
madness
do
you
ever
feel
said
he
to
me
one
day
as
though
imagined
suffering
affected
you
in
spite
of
yourself
if
for
instance
i
think
with
concentration
of
the
effect
that
the
blade
of
my
penknife
would
have
in
piercing
my
flesh
i
feel
an
acute
pain
as
if
i
had
really
cut
myself
only
the
blood
is
wanting
but
the
pain
comes
suddenly
and
startles
me
like
a
sharp
noise
breaking
profound
silence
can
an
idea
cause
physical
pain
what
do
you
say
to
that
eh
when
he
gave
utterance
to
such
subtle
reflections
we
both
fell
into
artless
meditation
we
set
to
work
to
detect
in
ourselves
the
inscrutable
phenomena
of
the
origin
of
thoughts
which
lambert
hoped
to
discover
in
their
earliest
germ
so
as
to
describe
some
day
the
unknown
process
then
after
much
discussion
often
mixed
up
with
childish
notions
a
look
would
flash
from
lambert
eager
eyes
he
would
grasp
my
hand
and
a
word
from
the
depths
of
his
soul
would
show
the
current
of
his
mind
thinking
is
seeing
said
he
one
day
carried
away
by
some
objection
raised
as
to
the
first
principles
of
our
organization
every
human
science
is
based
on
deduction
which
is
a
slow
process
of
seeing
by
which
we
work
up
from
the
effect
to
the
cause
or
in
a
wider
sense
all
poetry
like
every
work
of
art
proceeds
from
a
swift
vision
of
things
he
was
a
spiritualist
as
opposed
to
materialism
but
i
would
venture
to
contradict
him
using
his
own
arguments
to
consider
the
intellect
as
a
purely
physical
phenomenon
we
both
were
right
perhaps
the
words
materialism
and
spiritualism
express
the
two
faces
of
the
same
fact
his
considerations
on
the
substance
of
the
mind
led
to
his
accepting
with
a
certain
pride
the
life
of
privation
to
which
we
were
condemned
in
consequence
of
our
idleness
and
our
indifference
to
learning
he
had
a
certain
consciousness
of
his
own
powers
which
bore
him
up
through
his
spiritual
cogitations
how
delightful
it
was
to
me
to
feel
his
soul
acting
on
my
own
many
a
time
have
we
remained
sitting
on
our
form
both
buried
in
one
book
having
quite
forgotten
each
other
existence
and
yet
not
apart
each
conscious
of
the
other
presence
and
bathing
in
an
ocean
of
thought
like
two
fish
swimming
in
the
same
waters
our
life
apparently
was
merely
vegetating
but
we
lived
through
our
heart
and
brain
lambert
influence
over
my
imagination
left
traces
that
still
abide
i
used
to
listen
hungrily
to
his
tales
full
of
the
marvels
which
make
men
as
well
as
children
rapturously
devour
stories
in
which
truth
assumes
the
most
grotesque
forms
his
passion
for
mystery
and
the
credulity
natural
to
the
young
often
led
us
to
discuss
heaven
and
hell

expounding
swedenborg
would
try
to
make
me
share
in
his
beliefs
concerning
angels
in
his
least
logical
arguments
there
were
still
amazing
observations
as
to
the
powers
of
man
which
gave
his
words
that
color
of
truth
without
which
nothing
can
be
done
in
any
art
the
romantic
end
he
foresaw
as
the
destiny
of
man
was
calculated
to
flatter
the
yearning
which
tempts
blameless
imaginations
to
give
themselves
up
to
beliefs
is
it
not
during
the
youth
of
a
nation
that
its
dogmas
and
idols
are
conceived
and
are
not
the
supernatural
beings
before
whom
the
people
tremble
the
personification
of
their
feelings
and
their
magnified
desires
all
that
i
can
now
remember
of
the
poetical
conversations
we
held
together
concerning
the
swedish
prophet
whose
works
i
have
since
had
the
curiosity
to
read
may
be
told
in
a
few
paragraphs
in
each
of
us
there
are
two
distinct
beings
according
to
swedenborg
the
angel
is
an
individual
in
whom
the
inner
being
conquers
the
external
being
if
a
man
desires
to
earn
his
call
to
be
an
angel
as
soon
as
his
mind
reveals
to
him
his
twofold
existence
he
must
strive
to
foster
the
delicate
angelic
essence
that
exists
within
him
if
for
lack
of
a
lucid
appreciation
of
his
destiny
he
allows
bodily
action
to
predominate
instead
of
confirming
his
intellectual
being
all
his
powers
will
be
absorbed
in
the
use
of
his
external
senses
and
the
angel
will
slowly
perish
by
the
materialization
of
both
natures
in
the
contrary
case
if
he
nourishes
his
inner
being
with
the
aliment
needful
to
it
the
soul
triumphs
over
matter
and
strives
to
get
free
when
they
separate
by
the
act
of
what
we
call
death
the
angel
strong
enough
then
to
cast
off
its
wrappings
survives
and
begins
its
real
life
the
infinite
variety
which
differentiates
individual
men
can
only
be
explained
by
this
twofold
existence
which
again
is
proved
and
made
intelligible
by
that
variety
in
point
of
fact
the
wide
distance
between
a
man
whose
torpid
intelligence
condemns
him
to
evident
stupidity
and
one
who
by
the
exercise
of
his
inner
life
has
acquired
the
gift
of
some
power
allows
us
to
suppose
that
there
is
as
great
a
difference
between
men
of
genius
and
other
beings
as
there
is
between
the
blind
and
those
who
see
this
hypothesis
since
it
extends
creation
beyond
all
limits
gives
us
as
it
were
the
clue
to
heaven
the
beings
who
here
on
earth
are
apparently
mingled
without
distinction
are
there
distributed
according
to
their
inner
perfection
in
distinct
spheres
whose
speech
and
manners
have
nothing
in
common
in
the
invisible
world
as
in
the
real
world
if
some
native
of
the
lower
spheres
comes
all
unworthy
into
a
higher
sphere
not
only
can
he
never
understand
the
customs
and
language
there
but
his
mere
presence
paralyzes
the
voice
and
hearts
of
those
who
dwell
therein
dante
in
his
had
perhaps
some
slight
intuition
of
those
spheres
which
begin
in
the
world
of
torment
and
rise
circle
on
circle
to
the
highest
heaven
thus
swedenborg
doctrine
is
the
product
of
a
lucid
spirit
noting
down
the
innumerable
signs
by
which
the
angels
manifest
their
presence
among
men
this
doctrine
which
i
have
endeavored
to
sum
up
in
a
more
or
less
consistent
form
was
set
before
me
by
lambert
with
all
the
fascination
of
mysticism
swathed
in
the
wrappings
of
the
phraseology
affected
by
mystical
writers
an
obscure
language
full
of
abstractions
and
taking
such
effect
on
the
brain
that
there
are
books
by
jacob
boehm
swedenborg
and
madame
guyon
so
strangely
powerful
that
they
give
rise
to
phantasies
as
various
as
the
dreams
of
the
lambert
told
me
of
mystical
facts
so
extraordinary
he
so
acted
on
my
imagination
that
he
made
my
brain
reel
still
i
loved
to
plunge
into
that
realm
of
mystery
invisible
to
the
senses
in
which
every
one
likes
to
dwell
whether
he
pictures
it
to
himself
under
the
indefinite
ideal
of
the
future
or
clothes
it
in
the
more
solid
guise
of
romance
these
violent
revulsions
of
the
mind
on
itself
gave
me
without
my
knowing
it
a
comprehension
of
its
power
and
accustomed
me
to
the
workings
of
the
mind
lambert
himself
explained
everything
by
his
theory
of
the
angels
to
him
pure
love
love
as
we
dream
of
it
in
youth
was
the
coalescence
of
two
angelic
natures
nothing
could
exceed
the
fervency
with
which
he
longed
to
meet
a
woman
angel
and
who
better
than
he
could
inspire
or
feel
love
if
anything
could
give
an
impression
of
an
exquisite
nature
was
it
not
the
amiability
and
kindliness
that
marked
his
feelings
his
words
his
actions
his
slightest
gestures
the
conjugal
regard
that
united
us
as
boys
and
that
we
expressed
when
we
called
ourselves
there
was
no
distinction
for
us
between
my
ideas
and
his
we
imitated
each
other
handwriting
so
that
one
might
write
the
tasks
of
both
thus
if
one
of
us
had
a
book
to
finish
and
to
return
to
the
mathematical
master
he
could
read
on
without
interruption
while
the
other
scribbled
off
his
exercise
and
imposition
we
did
our
tasks
as
though
paying
a
task
on
our
peace
of
mind
if
my
memory
does
not
play
me
false
they
were
sometimes
of
remarkable
merit
when
lambert
did
them
but
on
the
foregone
conclusion
that
we
were
both
of
us
idiots
the
master
always
went
through
them
under
a
rooted
prejudice
and
even
kept
them
to
read
to
be
laughed
at
by
our
schoolfellows
i
remember
one
afternoon
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
which
lasted
from
two
till
four
the
master
took
possession
of
a
page
of
translation
by
lambert
the
passage
began
with
gracchus
vir
lambert
had
construed
this
by
caius
gracchus
had
a
noble
heart
where
do
you
find
in
said
the
father
sharply
and
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
while
lambert
looked
at
the
master
in
some
bewilderment
what
would
madame
la
baronne
de
stael
say
if
she
could
know
that
you
make
such
nonsense
of
a
word
that
means
noble
family
of
patrician
rank
she
would
say
that
you
were
an
ass
said
i
in
a
muttered
tone
master
poet
you
will
stay
in
for
a
week
replied
the
master
who
unfortunately
overheard
me
lambert
simply
repeated
looking
at
me
with
inexpressible
affection
madame
de
stael
was
in
fact
partly
the
cause
of
lambert
troubles
on
every
pretext
masters
and
pupils
threw
the
name
in
his
teeth
either
in
irony
or
in
reproof
louis
lost
no
time
in
getting
himself
kept
in
to
share
my
imprisonment
freer
thus
than
in
any
other
circumstances
we
could
talk
the
whole
day
long
in
the
silence
of
the
dormitories
where
each
boy
had
a
cubicle
six
feet
square
the
partitions
consisting
at
the
top
of
open
bars
the
doors
fitted
with
gratings
were
locked
at
night
and
opened
in
the
morning
under
the
eye
of
the
father
whose
duty
it
was
to
superintend
our
rising
and
going
to
bed
the
creak
of
these
gates
which
the
college
servants
unlocked
with
remarkable
expedition
was
a
sound
peculiar
to
that
college
these
little
cells
were
our
prison
and
boys
were
sometimes
shut
up
there
for
a
month
at
a
time
the
boys
in
these
coops
were
under
the
stern
eye
of
the
prefect
a
sort
of
censor
who
stole
up
at
certain
hours
or
at
unexpected
moments
with
a
silent
step
to
hear
if
we
were
talking
instead
of
writing
our
impositions
but
a
few
walnut
shells
dropped
on
the
stairs
or
the
sharpness
of
our
hearing
almost
always
enabled
us
to
beware
of
his
coming
so
we
could
give
ourselves
up
without
anxiety
to
our
favorite
studies
however
as
books
were
prohibited
our
prison
hours
were
chiefly
filled
up
with
metaphysical
discussions
or
with
relating
singular
facts
connected
with
the
phenomena
of
mind
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
of
these
incidents
beyond
question
is
this
which
i
will
here
record
not
only
because
it
concerns
lambert
but
because
it
perhaps
was
the
of
his
scientific
career
by
the
law
of
custom
in
all
schools
thursday
and
sunday
were
holidays
but
the
services
which
we
were
made
to
attend
very
regularly
so
completely
filled
up
sunday
that
we
considered
thursday
our
only
real
day
of
freedom
after
once
attending
mass
we
had
a
long
day
before
us
to
spend
in
walks
in
the
country
round
the
town
of
vendome
the
manor
of
rochambeau
was
the
most
interesting
object
of
our
excursions
perhaps
by
reason
of
its
distance
the
smaller
boys
were
very
seldom
taken
on
so
fatiguing
an
expedition
however
once
or
twice
a
year
the
would
hold
out
rochambeau
as
a
reward
for
diligence
in
towards
the
end
of
the
spring
we
were
to
go
there
for
the
first
time
our
anxiety
to
see
this
famous
chateau
of
rochambeau
where
the
owner
sometimes
treated
the
boys
to
milk
made
us
all
very
good
and
nothing
hindered
the
outing
neither
lambert
nor
i
had
ever
seen
the
pretty
valley
of
the
loire
where
the
house
stood
so
his
imagination
and
mine
were
much
excited
by
the
prospect
of
this
excursion
which
filled
the
school
with
traditional
glee
we
talked
of
it
all
the
evening
planning
to
spend
in
fruit
or
milk
such
money
as
we
had
saved
against
all
the
habits
of
after
dinner
next
day
we
set
out
at
twelve
each
provided
with
a
square
hunch
of
bread
given
to
us
for
our
afternoon
snack
and
off
we
went
as
gay
as
swallows
marching
in
a
body
on
the
famous
chateau
with
an
eagerness
which
would
at
first
allow
of
no
fatigue
when
we
reached
the
hill
whence
we
looked
down
on
the
house
standing
down
the
slope
on
the
devious
valley
through
which
the
river
winds
and
sparkles
between
meadows
in
graceful
curves
a
beautiful
landscape
one
of
those
scenes
to
which
the
keen
emotions
of
early
youth
or
of
love
lend
such
a
charm
that
it
is
wise
never
to
see
them
again
in
later
years
louis
lambert
said
to
me
why
i
saw
this
last
night
in
a
dream
he
recognized
the
clump
of
trees
under
which
we
were
standing
the
grouping
of
the
woods
the
color
of
the
water
the
turrets
of
the
chateau
the
details
the
distance
in
fact
every
part
of
the
prospect
which
we
looked
on
for
the
first
time
we
were
mere
children
i
at
any
rate
who
was
but
thirteen
louis
at
fifteen
might
have
the
precocity
of
genius
but
at
that
time
we
were
incapable
of
falsehood
in
the
most
trivial
matters
of
our
life
as
friends
indeed
if
lambert
powerful
mind
had
any
presentiment
of
the
importance
of
such
facts
he
was
far
from
appreciating
their
whole
bearing
and
he
was
quite
astonished
by
this
incident
i
asked
him
if
he
had
not
perhaps
been
brought
to
rochambeau
in
his
infancy
and
my
question
struck
him
but
after
thinking
it
over
he
answered
in
the
negative
this
incident
analogous
to
what
may
be
known
of
the
phenomena
of
sleep
in
several
persons
will
illustrate
the
beginnings
of
lambert
line
of
talent
he
took
it
in
fact
as
the
basis
of
a
whole
system
using
a
fragment
as
cuvier
did
in
another
branch
of
inquiry
as
a
clue
to
the
reconstruction
of
a
complete
system
at
this
moment
we
were
sitting
together
on
an
old
and
after
a
few
minutes
reflection
louis
said
to
me
if
the
landscape
did
not
come
to
me
which
it
is
absurd
to
imagine
i
must
have
come
here
if
i
was
here
while
i
was
asleep
in
my
cubicle
does
not
that
constitute
a
complete
severance
of
my
body
and
my
inner
being
does
it
not
prove
some
inscrutable
locomotive
faculty
in
the
spirit
with
effects
resembling
those
of
locomotion
in
the
body
well
then
if
my
spirit
and
my
body
can
be
severed
during
sleep
why
should
i
not
insist
on
their
separating
in
the
same
way
while
i
am
awake
i
see
no
mean
between
the
two
propositions
but
if
we
go
further
into
details
either
the
facts
are
due
to
the
action
of
a
faculty
which
brings
out
a
second
being
to
whom
my
body
is
merely
a
husk
since
i
was
in
my
cell
and
yet
i
saw
the
landscape
and
this
upsets
many
systems
or
the
facts
took
place
either
in
some
nerve
centre
of
which
the
name
is
yet
to
be
discovered
where
our
feelings
dwell
and
move
or
else
in
the
cerebral
centre
where
ideas
are
formed
this
last
hypothesis
gives
rise
to
some
strange
questions
i
walked
i
saw
i
heard
motion
is
inconceivable
but
in
space
sound
acts
only
at
certain
angles
or
on
surfaces
color
is
caused
only
by
light
if
in
the
dark
with
my
eyes
shut
i
saw
in
myself
colored
objects
if
i
heard
sounds
in
the
most
perfect
silence
and
without
the
conditions
requisite
for
the
production
of
sound
if
without
stirring
i
traversed
wide
tracts
of
space
there
must
be
inner
faculties
independent
of
the
external
laws
of
physics
material
nature
must
be
penetrable
by
the
spirit
how
is
it
that
men
have
hitherto
given
so
little
thought
to
the
phenomena
of
sleep
which
seem
to
prove
that
man
has
a
double
life
may
there
not
be
a
new
science
lying
beneath
them
he
added
striking
his
brow
with
his
hand
if
not
the
elements
of
a
science
at
any
rate
the
revelation
of
stupendous
powers
in
man
at
least
they
prove
a
frequent
severance
of
our
two
natures
the
fact
i
have
been
thinking
out
for
a
very
long
time
at
last
then
i
have
hit
on
evidence
to
show
the
superiority
that
distinguishes
our
latent
senses
from
our
corporeal
senses
and
yet
he
went
on
after
a
pause
with
a
doubtful
shrug
perhaps
we
have
not
two
natures
perhaps
we
are
merely
gifted
with
personal
and
perfectible
qualities
of
which
the
development
within
us
produces
certain
unobserved
phenomena
of
activity
penetration
and
vision
in
our
love
of
the
marvelous
a
passion
begotten
of
our
pride
we
have
translated
these
effects
into
poetical
inventions
because
we
did
not
understand
them
it
is
so
convenient
to
deify
the
incomprehensible
i
should
i
own
lament
over
the
loss
of
my
illusions
i
so
much
wished
to
believe
in
our
twofold
nature
and
in
swedenborg
angels
must
this
new
science
destroy
them
yes
for
the
study
of
our
unknown
properties
involves
us
in
a
science
that
appears
to
be
materialistic
for
the
spirit
uses
divides
and
animates
the
substance
but
it
does
not
destroy
it
he
remained
pensive
almost
sad
perhaps
he
saw
the
dreams
of
his
youth
as
swaddling
clothes
that
he
must
soon
shake
off
sight
and
hearing
are
no
doubt
the
sheaths
for
a
very
marvelous
instrument
said
he
laughing
at
his
own
figure
of
speech
always
when
he
was
talking
to
me
of
heaven
and
hell
he
was
wont
to
treat
of
nature
as
being
master
but
now
as
he
pronounced
these
last
words
big
with
prescience
he
seemed
to
soar
more
boldly
than
ever
above
the
landscape
and
his
forehead
seemed
ready
to
burst
with
the
afflatus
of
genius
his
powers
mental
powers
we
must
call
them
till
some
new
term
is
found
seemed
to
flash
from
the
organs
intended
to
express
them
his
eyes
shot
out
thoughts
his
uplifted
hand
his
silent
but
tremulous
lips
were
eloquent
his
burning
glance
was
radiant
at
last
his
head
as
though
too
heavy
or
exhausted
by
too
eager
a
flight
fell
on
his
breast
this
boy
this
giant
bent
his
head
took
my
hand
and
clasped
it
in
his
own
which
was
damp
so
fevered
was
he
for
the
search
for
truth
then
after
a
pause
he
said
i
shall
be
famous
and
you
too
he
added
after
a
pause
we
will
both
study
the
chemistry
of
the
will
noble
soul
i
recognized
his
superiority
though
he
took
great
care
never
to
make
me
feel
it
he
shared
with
me
all
the
treasures
of
his
mind
and
regarded
me
as
instrumental
in
his
discoveries
leaving
me
the
credit
of
my
insignificant
contributions
he
was
always
as
gracious
as
a
woman
in
love
he
had
all
the
bashful
feeling
the
delicacy
of
soul
which
make
life
happy
and
pleasant
to
endure
on
the
following
day
he
began
writing
what
he
called
a
on
the
his
subsequent
reflections
led
to
many
changes
in
its
plan
and
method
but
the
incident
of
that
day
was
certainly
the
germ
of
the
work
just
as
the
electric
shock
always
felt
by
mesmer
at
the
approach
of
a
particular
manservant
was
the
of
his
discoveries
in
magnetism
a
science
till
then
interred
under
the
mysteries
of
isis
of
delphi
of
the
cave
of
trophonius
and
rediscovered
by
that
prodigious
genius
close
on
lavater
and
the
precursor
of
gall
lambert
ideas
suddenly
illuminated
by
this
flash
of
light
assumed
vaster
proportions
he
disentangled
certain
truths
from
his
many
acquisitions
and
brought
them
into
order
then
like
a
founder
he
cast
the
model
of
his
work
at
the
end
of
six
months
indefatigable
labor
lambert
writings
excited
the
curiosity
of
our
companions
and
became
the
object
of
cruel
practical
jokes
which
led
to
a
fatal
issue
one
day
one
of
the
masters
who
was
bent
on
seeing
the
manuscripts
enlisted
the
aid
of
our
tyrants
and
came
to
seize
by
force
a
box
that
contained
the
precious
papers
lambert
and
i
defended
it
with
incredible
courage
the
trunk
was
locked
our
aggressors
could
not
open
it
but
they
tried
to
smash
it
in
the
struggle
a
stroke
of
malignity
at
which
we
shrieked
with
rage
some
of
the
boys
with
a
sense
of
justice
or
struck
perhaps
by
our
heroic
defence
advised
the
attacking
party
to
leave
us
in
peace
crushing
us
with
insulting
contempt
but
suddenly
brought
to
the
spot
by
the
noise
of
a
battle
father
haugoult
roughly
intervened
inquiring
as
to
the
cause
of
the
fight
our
enemies
had
interrupted
us
in
writing
our
impositions
and
the
came
to
protect
his
slaves
the
foe
in
betrayed
the
existence
of
the
manuscript
the
dreadful
haugoult
insisted
on
our
giving
up
the
box
if
we
should
resist
he
would
have
it
broken
open
lambert
gave
him
the
key
the
master
took
out
the
papers
glanced
through
them
and
said
as
he
confiscated
them
and
it
is
for
such
rubbish
as
this
that
you
neglect
your
lessons
large
tears
fell
from
lambert
eyes
wrung
from
him
as
much
by
a
sense
of
his
offended
moral
superiority
as
by
the
gratuitous
insult
and
betrayal
that
he
had
suffered
we
gave
the
accusers
a
glance
of
stern
reproach
had
they
not
delivered
us
over
to
the
common
enemy
if
the
common
law
of
school
entitled
them
to
thrash
us
did
it
not
require
them
to
keep
silence
as
to
our
misdeeds
in
a
moment
they
were
no
doubt
ashamed
of
their
baseness
father
haugoult
probably
sold
the
on
the
to
a
local
grocer
unconscious
of
the
scientific
treasure
of
which
the
germs
thus
fell
into
unworthy
hands
six
months
later
i
left
the
school
and
i
do
not
know
whether
lambert
ever
recommenced
his
labors
our
parting
threw
him
into
a
mood
of
the
darkest
melancholy
it
was
in
memory
of
the
disaster
that
befell
louis
book
that
in
the
tale
which
comes
first
in
these
i
adopted
the
title
invented
by
lambert
for
a
work
of
fiction
and
gave
the
name
of
a
woman
who
was
dear
to
him
to
a
girl
characterized
by
her
but
this
is
not
all
i
have
borrowed
from
him
his
character
and
occupations
were
of
great
value
to
me
in
writing
that
book
and
the
subject
arose
from
some
reminiscences
of
our
youthful
meditations
this
present
volume
is
intended
as
a
modest
monument
a
broken
column
to
commemorate
the
life
of
the
man
who
bequeathed
to
me
all
he
had
to
leave
his
thoughts
in
that
boyish
effort
lambert
had
enshrined
the
ideas
of
a
man
ten
years
later
when
i
met
some
learned
men
who
were
devoting
serious
attention
to
the
phenomena
that
had
struck
us
and
that
lambert
had
so
marvelously
analyzed
i
understood
the
value
of
his
work
then
already
forgotten
as
childish
i
at
once
spent
several
months
in
recalling
the
principal
theories
discovered
by
my
poor
schoolmate
having
collected
my
reminiscences
i
can
boldly
state
that
by
he
had
proved
divined
and
set
forth
in
his
treatise
several
important
facts
of
which
as
he
had
declared
evidence
was
certain
to
come
sooner
or
later
his
philosophical
speculations
ought
undoubtedly
to
gain
him
recognition
as
one
of
the
great
thinkers
who
have
appeared
at
wide
intervals
among
men
to
reveal
to
them
the
bare
skeleton
of
some
science
to
come
of
which
the
roots
spread
slowly
but
which
in
due
time
bring
forth
fair
fruit
in
the
intellectual
sphere
thus
a
humble
artisan
bernard
palissy
searching
the
soil
to
find
minerals
for
glazing
pottery
proclaimed
in
the
sixteenth
century
with
the
infallible
intuition
of
genius
geological
facts
which
it
is
now
the
glory
of
cuvier
and
buffon
to
have
demonstrated
i
can
i
believe
give
some
idea
of
lambert
treatise
by
stating
the
chief
propositions
on
which
it
was
based
but
in
spite
of
myself
i
shall
strip
them
of
the
ideas
in
which
they
were
clothed
and
which
were
indeed
their
indispensable
accompaniment
i
started
on
a
different
path
and
only
made
use
of
those
of
his
researches
which
answered
the
purpose
of
my
scheme
i
know
not
therefore
whether
as
his
disciple
i
can
faithfully
expound
his
views
having
assimilated
them
in
the
first
instance
so
as
to
color
them
with
my
own
new
ideas
require
new
words
or
a
new
and
expanded
use
of
old
words
extended
and
defined
in
their
meaning
thus
lambert
to
set
forth
the
basis
of
his
system
had
adopted
certain
common
words
that
answered
to
his
notions
the
word
will
he
used
to
connote
the
medium
in
which
the
mind
moves
or
to
use
a
less
abstract
expression
the
mass
of
power
by
which
man
can
reproduce
outside
himself
the
actions
constituting
his
external
life
volition
a
word
due
to
locke
expressed
the
act
by
which
a
man
exerts
his
will
the
word
mind
or
thought
which
he
regarded
as
the
quintessential
product
of
the
will
also
represented
the
medium
in
which
the
ideas
originate
to
which
thought
gives
substance
the
idea
a
name
common
to
every
creation
of
the
brain
constituted
the
act
by
which
man
uses
his
mind
thus
the
will
and
the
mind
were
the
two
generating
forces
the
volition
and
the
idea
were
the
two
products
volition
he
thought
was
the
idea
evolved
from
the
abstract
state
to
a
concrete
state
from
its
generative
fluid
to
a
solid
expression
so
to
speak
if
such
words
may
be
taken
to
formulate
notions
so
difficult
of
definition
according
to
him
the
mind
and
ideas
are
the
motion
and
the
outcome
of
our
inner
organization
just
as
the
will
and
volition
are
of
our
external
activity
he
gave
the
will
precedence
over
the
mind
you
must
will
before
you
can
think
he
said
many
beings
live
in
a
condition
of
willing
without
ever
attaining
to
the
condition
of
thinking
in
the
north
life
is
long
in
the
south
it
is
shorter
but
in
the
north
we
see
torpor
in
the
south
a
constant
excitability
of
the
will
up
to
the
point
where
from
an
excess
of
cold
or
of
heat
the
organs
are
almost
nullified
the
use
of
the
word
medium
was
suggested
to
him
by
an
observation
he
had
made
in
his
childhood
though
to
be
sure
he
had
no
suspicion
then
of
its
importance
but
its
singularity
naturally
struck
his
delicately
alert
imagination
his
mother
a
fragile
nervous
woman
all
sensitiveness
and
affection
was
one
of
those
beings
created
to
represent
womanhood
in
all
the
perfection
of
her
attributes
but
relegated
by
a
mistaken
fate
to
too
low
a
place
in
the
social
scale
wholly
loving
and
consequently
wholly
suffering
she
died
young
having
thrown
all
her
energies
into
her
motherly
love
lambert
a
child
of
six
lying
but
not
always
sleeping
in
a
cot
by
his
mother
bed
saw
the
electric
sparks
from
her
hair
when
she
combed
it
the
man
of
fifteen
made
scientific
application
of
this
fact
which
had
amused
the
child
a
fact
beyond
dispute
of
which
there
is
ample
evidence
in
many
instances
especially
of
women
who
by
a
sad
fatality
are
doomed
to
let
unappreciated
feelings
evaporate
in
the
air
or
some
superabundant
power
run
to
waste
in
support
of
his
definitions
lambert
propounded
a
variety
of
problems
to
be
solved
challenges
flung
out
to
science
though
he
proposed
to
seek
the
solution
for
himself
he
inquired
for
instance
whether
the
element
that
constitutes
electricity
does
not
enter
as
a
base
into
the
specific
fluid
whence
our
ideas
and
volitions
proceed
whether
the
hair
which
loses
its
color
turns
white
falls
out
or
disappears
in
proportion
to
the
decay
or
crystallization
of
our
thoughts
may
not
be
in
fact
a
capillary
system
either
absorbent
or
diffusive
and
wholly
electrical
whether
the
fluid
phenomena
of
the
will
a
matter
generated
within
us
and
spontaneously
reacting
under
the
impress
of
conditions
as
yet
unobserved
were
at
all
more
extraordinary
than
those
of
the
invisible
and
intangible
fluid
produced
by
a
voltaic
pile
and
applied
to
the
nervous
system
of
a
dead
man
whether
the
formation
of
ideas
and
their
constant
diffusion
was
less
incomprehensible
than
evaporation
of
the
atoms
imperceptible
indeed
but
so
violent
in
their
effects
that
are
given
off
from
a
grain
of
musk
without
any
loss
of
weight
whether
granting
that
the
function
of
the
skin
is
purely
protective
absorbent
excretive
and
tactile
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
all
its
mechanism
would
not
correspond
with
the
transsubstantiation
of
our
will
as
the
circulation
of
the
nerve
fluid
corresponds
to
that
of
the
mind
finally
whether
the
more
or
less
rapid
affluence
of
these
two
real
substances
may
not
be
the
result
of
a
certain
perfection
or
imperfection
of
organs
whose
conditions
require
investigation
in
every
manifestation
having
set
forth
these
principles
he
proposed
to
class
the
phenomena
of
human
life
in
two
series
of
distinct
results
demanding
with
the
ardent
insistency
of
conviction
a
special
analysis
for
each
in
fact
having
observed
in
almost
every
type
of
created
thing
two
separate
motions
he
assumed
nay
he
asserted
their
existence
in
our
human
nature
and
designated
this
vital
antithesis
action
and
reaction
a
desire
he
said
is
a
fact
completely
accomplished
in
our
will
before
it
is
accomplished
externally
hence
the
of
our
volitions
and
our
ideas
constitutes
action
and
the
of
our
external
acts
he
called
reaction
when
i
subsequently
read
the
observations
made
by
bichat
on
the
duality
of
our
external
senses
i
was
really
bewildered
by
my
recollections
recognizing
the
startling
coincidences
between
the
views
of
that
celebrated
physiologist
and
those
of
louis
lambert
they
both
died
young
and
they
had
with
equal
steps
arrived
at
the
same
strange
truths
nature
has
in
every
case
been
pleased
to
give
a
twofold
purpose
to
the
various
apparatus
that
constitute
her
creatures
and
the
twofold
action
of
the
human
organism
which
is
now
ascertained
beyond
dispute
proves
by
a
mass
of
evidence
in
daily
life
how
true
were
lambert
deductions
as
to
action
and
reaction
the
inner
being
the
being
of
action
the
word
he
used
to
designate
an
unknown
specialization
the
mysterious
nexus
of
fibrils
to
which
we
owe
the
inadequately
investigated
powers
of
thought
and
will
in
short
the
nameless
entity
which
sees
acts
foresees
the
end
and
accomplishes
everything
before
expressing
itself
in
any
physical
phenomenon
must
in
conformity
with
its
nature
be
free
from
the
physical
conditions
by
which
the
external
being
of
reaction
the
visible
man
is
fettered
in
its
manifestation
from
this
followed
a
multitude
of
logical
explanation
as
to
those
results
of
our
twofold
nature
which
appear
the
strangest
and
a
rectification
of
various
systems
in
which
truth
and
falsehood
are
mingled
certain
men
having
had
a
glimpse
of
some
phenomena
of
the
natural
working
of
the
being
of
action
were
like
swedenborg
carried
away
above
this
world
by
their
ardent
soul
thirsting
for
poetry
and
filled
with
the
divine
spirit
thus
in
their
ignorance
of
the
causes
and
their
admiration
of
the
facts
they
pleased
their
fancy
by
regarding
that
inner
man
as
divine
and
constructing
a
mystical
universe
hence
we
have
angels
a
lovely
illusion
which
lambert
would
never
abandon
cherishing
it
even
when
the
sword
of
his
logic
was
cutting
off
their
dazzling
wings
heaven
he
would
say
must
after
all
be
the
survival
of
our
perfected
faculties
and
hell
the
void
into
which
our
unperfected
faculties
are
cast
away
but
how
then
in
the
ages
when
the
understanding
had
preserved
the
religious
and
spiritualist
impressions
which
prevailed
from
the
time
of
christ
till
that
of
descartes
between
faith
and
doubt
how
could
men
help
accounting
for
the
mysteries
of
our
nature
otherwise
than
by
divine
interposition
of
whom
but
of
god
himself
could
sages
demand
an
account
of
an
invisible
creature
so
actively
and
so
reactively
sensitive
gifted
with
faculties
so
extensive
so
improvable
by
use
and
so
powerful
under
certain
occult
influences
that
they
could
sometimes
see
it
annihilate
by
some
phenomenon
of
sight
or
movement
space
in
its
two
manifestations
time
and
distance
of
which
the
former
is
the
space
of
the
intellect
the
latter
is
physical
space
sometimes
they
found
it
reconstructing
the
past
either
by
the
power
of
retrospective
vision
or
by
the
mystery
of
a
palingenesis
not
unlike
the
power
a
man
might
have
of
detecting
in
the
form
integument
and
embryo
in
a
seed
the
flowers
of
the
past
and
the
numberless
variations
of
their
color
scent
and
shape
and
sometimes
again
it
could
be
seen
vaguely
foreseeing
the
future
either
by
its
apprehension
of
final
causes
or
by
some
phenomenon
of
physical
presentiment
other
men
less
poetically
religious
cold
and
argumentative
quacks
perhaps
but
enthusiasts
in
brain
at
least
if
not
in
heart
recognizing
some
isolated
examples
of
such
phenomena
admitted
their
truth
while
refusing
to
consider
them
as
radiating
from
a
common
centre
each
of
these
was
then
bent
on
constructing
a
science
out
of
a
simple
fact
hence
arose
demonology
judicial
astrology
the
black
arts
in
short
every
form
of
divination
founded
on
circumstances
that
were
essentially
transient
because
they
varied
according
to
temperament
and
to
conditions
that
are
still
completely
unknown
but
from
these
errors
of
the
learned
and
from
the
ecclesiastical
trials
under
which
fell
so
many
martyrs
to
their
own
powers
startling
evidence
was
derived
of
the
prodigious
faculties
at
the
command
of
the
being
of
action
which
according
to
lambert
can
abstract
itself
completely
from
the
being
of
reaction
bursting
its
envelope
and
piercing
walls
by
its
potent
vision
a
phenomenon
known
to
the
hindoos
as
missionaries
tell
us
by
the
name
of
or
again
by
another
faculty
can
grasp
in
the
brain
in
spite
of
its
closest
convolutions
the
ideas
which
are
formed
or
forming
there
and
the
whole
of
past
consciousness
if
apparitions
are
not
impossible
said
lambert
they
must
be
due
to
a
faculty
of
discerning
the
ideas
which
represent
man
in
his
purest
essence
whose
life
imperishable
perhaps
escapes
our
grosser
senses
though
they
may
become
perceptible
to
the
inner
being
when
it
has
reached
a
high
degree
of
ecstasy
or
a
great
perfection
of
vision
i
know
though
my
remembrance
is
now
vague
that
lambert
by
following
the
results
of
mind
and
will
step
by
step
after
he
had
established
their
laws
accounted
for
a
multitude
of
phenomena
which
till
then
had
been
regarded
with
reason
as
incomprehensible
thus
wizards
men
possessed
with
second
sight
and
demoniacs
of
every
degree
the
victims
of
the
middle
ages
became
the
subject
of
explanations
so
natural
that
their
very
simplicity
often
seemed
to
me
the
seal
of
their
truth
the
marvelous
gifts
which
the
church
of
rome
jealous
of
all
mysteries
punished
with
the
stake
were
in
louis
opinion
the
result
of
certain
affinities
between
the
constituent
elements
of
matter
and
those
of
mind
which
proceed
from
the
same
source
the
man
holding
a
hazel
rod
when
he
found
a
spring
of
water
was
guided
by
some
antipathy
or
sympathy
of
which
he
was
unconscious
nothing
but
the
eccentricity
of
these
phenomena
could
have
availed
to
give
some
of
them
historic
certainty
sympathies
have
rarely
been
proved
they
afford
a
kind
of
pleasure
which
those
who
are
so
happy
as
to
possess
them
rarely
speak
of
unless
they
are
abnormally
singular
and
even
then
only
in
the
privacy
of
intimate
intercourse
where
everything
is
buried
but
the
antipathies
that
arise
from
the
inversion
of
affinities
have
very
happily
been
recorded
when
developed
by
famous
men
thus
bayle
had
hysterics
when
he
heard
water
splashing
scaliger
turned
pale
at
the
sight
of
erasmus
was
thrown
into
a
fever
by
the
smell
of
fish
these
three
antipathies
were
connected
with
water
the
duc
fainted
at
the
sight
of
a
hare
at
that
of
a
fox
henri
iii
at
the
presence
of
a
cat
the
marechal
at
the
sight
of
a
wild
hog
these
antipathies
were
produced
by
animal
emanations
and
often
took
effect
at
a
great
distance
the
chevalier
de
guise
marie
de
medici
and
many
other
persons
have
felt
faint
at
seeing
a
rose
even
in
a
painting
lord
bacon
whether
he
were
forewarned
or
no
of
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
always
fell
into
a
syncope
while
it
lasted
and
his
vitality
suspended
while
the
phenomenon
lasted
was
restored
as
soon
as
it
was
over
without
his
feeling
any
further
inconvenience
these
effects
of
antipathy
all
well
authenticated
and
chosen
from
among
many
which
history
has
happened
to
preserve
are
enough
to
give
a
clue
to
the
sympathies
which
remain
unknown
this
fragment
of
lambert
investigations
which
i
remember
from
among
his
essays
will
throw
a
light
on
the
method
on
which
he
worked
i
need
not
emphasize
the
obvious
connection
between
this
theory
and
the
collateral
sciences
projected
by
gall
and
lavater
they
were
its
natural
corollary
and
every
more
or
less
scientific
brain
will
discern
the
ramifications
by
which
it
is
inevitably
connected
with
the
phrenological
observations
of
one
and
the
speculations
on
physiognomy
of
the
other
mesmer
discovery
so
important
though
as
yet
so
little
appreciated
was
also
embodied
in
a
single
section
of
this
treatise
though
louis
did
not
know
the
swiss
doctor
writings
which
are
few
and
brief
a
simple
and
logical
inference
from
these
principles
led
him
to
perceive
that
the
will
might
be
accumulated
by
a
contractile
effort
of
the
inner
man
and
then
by
another
effort
projected
or
even
imparted
to
material
objects
thus
the
whole
force
of
a
man
must
have
the
property
of
reacting
on
other
men
and
of
infusing
into
them
an
essence
foreign
to
their
own
if
they
could
not
protect
themselves
against
such
an
aggression
the
evidence
of
this
theorem
of
the
science
of
humanity
is
of
course
very
multifarious
but
there
is
nothing
to
establish
it
beyond
question
we
have
only
the
notorious
disaster
of
marius
and
his
harangue
to
the
cimbrian
commanded
to
kill
him
or
the
august
injunction
of
a
mother
to
the
lion
of
florence
in
historic
proof
of
instances
of
such
lightning
flashes
of
mind
to
lambert
then
will
and
thought
were
and
he
spoke
of
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
impress
his
belief
on
the
hearer
to
him
these
two
forces
were
in
a
way
visible
tangible
thought
was
slow
or
alert
heavy
or
nimble
light
or
dark
he
ascribed
to
it
all
the
attributes
of
an
active
agent
and
thought
of
it
as
rising
resting
waking
expanding
growing
old
shrinking
becoming
atrophied
or
resuscitating
he
described
its
life
and
specified
all
its
actions
by
the
strangest
words
in
our
language
speaking
of
its
spontaneity
its
strength
and
all
its
qualities
with
a
kind
of
intuition
which
enabled
him
to
recognize
all
the
manifestations
of
its
substantial
existence
often
said
he
in
the
midst
of
quiet
and
silence
when
our
inner
faculties
are
dormant
when
a
sort
of
darkness
reigns
within
us
and
we
are
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
things
outside
us
an
idea
suddenly
flies
forth
and
rushes
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
across
the
infinite
space
which
our
inner
vision
allows
us
to
perceive
this
radiant
idea
springing
into
existence
like
a
dies
out
never
to
return
an
ephemeral
life
like
that
of
babes
who
give
their
parents
such
infinite
joy
and
sorrow
a
sort
of
blossom
in
the
fields
of
the
mind
sometimes
an
idea
instead
of
springing
forcibly
into
life
and
dying
unembodied
dawns
gradually
hovers
in
the
unknown
limbo
of
the
organs
where
it
has
its
birth
exhausts
us
by
long
gestation
develops
is
itself
fruitful
grows
outwardly
in
all
the
grace
of
youth
and
the
promising
attributes
of
a
long
life
it
can
endure
the
closest
inspection
invites
it
and
never
tires
the
sight
the
investigation
it
undergoes
commands
the
admiration
we
give
to
works
slowly
elaborated
sometimes
ideas
are
evolved
in
a
swarm
one
brings
another
they
come
linked
together
they
vie
with
each
other
they
fly
in
clouds
wild
and
headlong
again
they
rise
up
pallid
and
misty
and
perish
for
want
of
strength
or
of
nutrition
the
vital
force
is
lacking
or
again
on
certain
days
they
rush
down
into
the
depths
to
light
up
that
immense
obscurity
they
terrify
us
and
leave
the
soul
dejected
ideas
are
a
complete
system
within
us
resembling
a
natural
kingdom
a
sort
of
flora
of
which
the
iconography
will
one
day
be
outlined
by
some
man
who
will
perhaps
be
accounted
a
madman
yes
within
us
and
without
everything
testifies
to
the
livingness
of
those
exquisite
creations
which
i
compare
with
flowers
in
obedience
to
some
unutterable
revelation
of
their
true
nature
their
being
produced
as
the
final
cause
of
man
is
after
all
not
more
amazing
than
the
production
of
perfume
and
color
in
a
plant
perfumes
ideas
perhaps
when
we
consider
the
line
where
flesh
ends
and
the
nail
begins
contains
the
invisible
and
inexplicable
mystery
of
the
constant
transformation
of
a
fluid
into
horn
we
must
confess
that
nothing
is
impossible
in
the
marvelous
modifications
of
human
tissue
and
are
there
not
in
our
inner
nature
phenomena
of
weight
and
motion
comparable
to
those
of
physical
nature
suspense
to
choose
an
example
vividly
familiar
to
everybody
is
painful
only
as
a
result
of
the
law
in
virtue
of
which
the
weight
of
a
body
is
multiplied
by
its
velocity
the
weight
of
the
feeling
produced
by
suspense
increases
by
the
constant
addition
of
past
pain
to
the
pain
of
the
moment
and
then
to
what
unless
it
be
to
the
electric
fluid
are
we
to
attribute
the
magic
by
which
the
will
enthrones
itself
so
imperiously
in
the
eye
to
demolish
obstacles
at
the
behest
of
genius
thunders
in
the
voice
or
filters
in
spite
of
dissimulation
through
the
human
frame
the
current
of
that
sovereign
fluid
which
in
obedience
to
the
high
pressure
of
thought
or
of
feeling
flows
in
a
torrent
or
is
reduced
to
a
mere
thread
and
collects
to
flash
in
lightnings

the
occult
agent
to
which
are
due
the
evil

efforts

harsh

our
will
the
marvels

the
touch
the
instrument
of
the
mental
transfusions
of
a
myriad
artists
whose
creative
fingers
are
able
after
passionate
study
to
reproduce
the

of

again
the
infinite
gradations
of
the

dull
inertia

the
most
terrifying
gleams

this
system
god
is
bereft
of
none
of
his
rights
mind
as
a
form
of
matter
has
brought
me
a
new
conviction
of
his
greatness
after
hearing
him
discourse
thus
after
receiving
into
my
soul
his
look
like
a
ray
of
light
it
was
difficult
not
to
be
dazzled
by
his
conviction
and
carried
away
by
his
arguments
the
mind
appeared
to
me
as
a
purely
physical
power
surrounded
by
its
innumerable
progeny
it
was
a
new
conception
of
humanity
under
a
new
form
this
brief
sketch
of
the
laws
which
as
lambert
maintained
constitute
the
formula
of
our
intellect
must
suffice
to
give
a
notion
of
the
prodigious
activity
of
his
spirit
feeding
on
itself
louis
had
sought
for
proofs
of
his
theories
in
the
history
of
great
men
whose
lives
as
set
forth
by
their
biographers
supply
very
curious
particulars
as
to
the
operation
of
their
understanding
his
memory
allowed
him
to
recall
such
facts
as
might
serve
to
support
his
statements
he
had
appended
them
to
each
chapter
in
the
form
of
demonstrations
so
as
to
give
to
many
of
his
theories
an
almost
mathematical
certainty
the
works
of
cardan
a
man
gifted
with
singular
powers
of
insight
supplied
him
with
valuable
materials
he
had
not
forgotten
that
apollonius
of
tyana
had
in
asia
announced
the
death
of
a
tyrant
with
every
detail
of
his
execution
at
the
very
hour
when
it
was
taking
place
in
rome
nor
that
plotinus
when
far
away
from
porphyrius
was
aware
of
his
intention
to
kill
himself
and
flew
to
dissuade
him
nor
the
incident
in
the
last
century
proved
in
the
face
of
the
most
incredulous
mockery
ever
known
an
incident
most
surprising
to
men
who
were
accustomed
to
regard
doubt
as
a
weapon
against
the
fact
alone
but
simple
enough
to
believers
the
fact
that
di
liguori
bishop
of
administered
consolations
to
pope
ganganelli
who
saw
him
heard
him
and
answered
him
while
the
bishop
himself
at
a
great
distance
from
rome
was
in
a
trance
at
home
in
the
chair
where
he
commonly
sat
on
his
return
from
mass
on
recovering
consciousness
he
saw
all
his
attendants
kneeling
beside
him
believing
him
to
be
dead
my
friends
said
he
the
holy
father
is
just
dead
two
days
later
a
letter
confirmed
the
news
the
hour
of
the
pope
death
coincided
with
that
when
the
bishop
had
been
restored
to
his
natural
state
nor
had
lambert
omitted
the
yet
more
recent
adventure
of
an
english
girl
who
was
passionately
attached
to
a
sailor
and
set
out
from
london
to
seek
him
she
found
him
without
a
guide
making
her
way
alone
in
the
north
american
wilderness
reaching
him
just
in
time
to
save
his
life
louis
had
found
confirmatory
evidence
in
the
mysteries
of
the
ancients
in
the
acts
of
the
martyrs
in
which
glorious
instances
may
be
found
of
the
triumph
of
human
will
in
the
demonology
of
the
middle
ages
in
criminal
trials
and
medical
researches
always
selecting
the
real
fact
the
probable
phenomenon
with
admirable
sagacity
all
this
rich
collection
of
scientific
anecdotes
culled
from
so
many
books
most
of
them
worthy
of
credit
served
no
doubt
to
wrap
parcels
in
and
this
work
which
was
curious
to
say
the
least
of
it
as
the
outcome
of
a
most
extraordinary
memory
was
doomed
to
destruction
among
the
various
cases
which
added
to
the
value
of
lambert
was
an
incident
that
had
taken
place
in
his
own
family
of
which
he
had
told
me
before
he
wrote
his
essay
this
fact
bearing
on
the
of
the
inner
man
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
coin
a
new
word
for
a
phenomenon
hitherto
nameless
struck
me
so
forcibly
that
i
have
never
forgotten
it
his
father
and
mother
were
being
forced
into
a
lawsuit
of
which
the
loss
would
leave
them
with
a
stain
on
their
good
name
the
only
thing
they
had
in
the
world
hence
their
anxiety
was
very
great
when
the
question
first
arose
as
to
whether
they
should
yield
to
the
plaintiff
unjust
demands
or
should
defend
themselves
against
him
the
matter
came
under
discussion
one
autumn
evening
before
a
turf
fire
in
the
room
used
by
the
tanner
and
his
wife
two
or
three
relations
were
invited
to
this
family
council
and
among
others
louis
maternal
an
old
laborer
much
bent
but
with
a
venerable
and
dignified
countenance
bright
eyes
and
a
bald
yellow
head
on
which
grew
a
few
locks
of
thin
white
hair
like
the
obi
of
the
negroes
or
the
sagamore
of
the
indian
savages
he
was
a
sort
of
oracle
consulted
on
important
occasions
his
land
was
tilled
by
his
grandchildren
who
fed
and
served
him
he
predicted
rain
and
fine
weather
and
told
them
when
to
mow
the
hay
and
gather
the
crops
the
barometric
exactitude
of
his
forecasts
was
quite
famous
and
added
to
the
confidence
and
respect
he
inspired
for
whole
days
he
would
sit
immovable
in
his
armchair
this
state
of
rapt
meditation
often
came
upon
him
since
his
wife
death
he
had
been
attached
to
her
in
the
truest
and
most
faithful
affection
this
discussion
was
held
in
his
presence
but
he
did
not
seem
to
give
much
heed
to
it
my
children
said
he
when
he
was
asked
for
his
opinion
this
is
too
serious
a
matter
for
me
to
decide
on
alone
i
must
go
and
consult
my
wife
the
old
man
rose
took
his
stick
and
went
out
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
others
who
thought
him
daft
he
presently
came
back
and
said
i
did
not
have
to
go
so
far
as
the
graveyard
your
mother
came
to
meet
me
i
found
her
by
the
brook
she
tells
me
that
you
will
find
some
receipts
in
the
hands
of
a
notary
at
blois
which
will
enable
you
to
gain
your
suit
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
firm
tone
the
old
man
demeanor
and
countenance
showed
that
such
an
apparition
was
habitual
with
him
in
fact
the
disputed
receipts
were
found
and
the
lawsuit
was
not
attempted
this
event
under
his
father
roof
and
to
his
own
knowledge
when
louis
was
nine
years
old
contributed
largely
to
his
belief
in
miraculous
visions
for
in
the
course
of
that
philosopher
life
he
repeatedly
gave
proof
of
the
power
of
sight
developed
in
his
inner
being
as
he
grew
older
and
as
his
intelligence
was
developed
lambert
was
naturally
led
to
seek
in
the
laws
of
nature
for
the
causes
of
the
miracle
which
in
his
childhood
had
captivated
his
attention
what
name
can
be
given
to
the
chance
which
brought
within
his
ken
so
many
facts
and
books
bearing
on
such
phenomena
and
made
him
the
principal
subject
and
actor
in
such
marvelous
manifestations
of
mind
if
lambert
had
no
other
title
to
fame
than
the
fact
of
his
having
formulated
in
his
sixteenth
year
such
a
psychological
dictum
as
this
the
events
which
bear
witness
to
the
action
of
the
human
race
and
are
the
outcome
of
its
intellect
have
causes
by
which
they
are
preconceived
as
our
actions
are
accomplished
in
our
minds
before
they
are
reproduced
by
the
outer
man
presentiments
or
predictions
are
the
perception
of
these
causes
i
think
we
may
deplore
in
him
a
genius
equal
to
pascal
lavoisier
or
laplace
his
chimerical
notions
about
angels
perhaps
overruled
his
work
too
long
but
was
it
not
in
trying
to
make
gold
that
the
alchemists
unconsciously
created
chemistry
at
the
same
time
lambert
at
a
later
period
studied
comparative
anatomy
physics
geometry
and
other
sciences
bearing
on
his
discoveries
and
this
was
undoubtedly
with
the
purpose
of
collecting
facts
and
submitting
them
to
analysis
the
only
torch
that
can
guide
us
through
the
dark
places
of
the
most
inscrutable
work
of
nature
he
had
too
much
good
sense
to
dwell
among
the
clouds
of
theories
which
can
all
be
expressed
in
a
few
words
in
our
day
is
not
the
simplest
demonstration
based
on
facts
more
highly
esteemed
than
the
most
specious
system
though
defended
by
more
or
less
ingenious
inductions
but
as
i
did
not
know
him
at
the
period
of
his
life
when
his
cogitations
were
no
doubt
the
most
productive
of
results
i
can
only
conjecture
that
the
bent
of
his
work
must
have
been
from
that
of
his
first
efforts
of
thought
it
is
easy
to
see
where
his
on
the
was
faulty
though
gifted
already
with
the
powers
which
characterize
superior
men
he
was
but
a
boy
his
brain
though
endowed
with
a
great
faculty
for
abstractions
was
still
full
of
the
delightful
beliefs
that
hover
around
youth
thus
his
conception
while
at
some
points
it
touched
the
ripest
fruits
of
his
genius
still
by
many
more
clung
to
the
smaller
elements
of
its
germs
to
certain
readers
lovers
of
poetry
what
he
chiefly
lacked
must
have
been
a
certain
vein
of
interest
but
his
work
bore
the
stamp
of
the
struggle
that
was
going
on
in
that
noble
spirit
between
the
two
great
principles
of
spiritualism
and
materialism
round
which
so
many
a
fine
genius
has
beaten
its
way
without
ever
daring
to
amalgamate
them
louis
at
first
purely
spiritualist
had
been
irresistibly
led
to
recognize
the
material
conditions
of
mind
confounded
by
the
facts
of
analysis
at
the
moment
when
his
heart
still
gazed
with
yearning
at
the
clouds
which
floated
in
swedenborg
heaven
he
had
not
yet
acquired
the
necessary
powers
to
produce
a
coherent
system
compactly
cast
in
a
piece
as
it
were
hence
certain
inconsistencies
that
have
left
their
stamp
even
on
the
sketch
here
given
of
his
first
attempts
still
incomplete
as
his
work
may
have
been
was
it
not
the
rough
copy
of
a
science
of
which
he
would
have
investigated
the
secrets
at
a
later
time
have
secured
the
foundations
have
examined
deduced
and
connected
the
logical
sequence
six
months
after
the
confiscation
of
the
on
the
i
left
school
our
parting
was
unexpected
my
mother
alarmed
by
a
feverish
attack
which
for
some
months
i
had
been
unable
to
shake
off
while
my
inactive
life
induced
symptoms
of
carried
me
off
at
four
or
five
hours
notice
the
announcement
of
my
departure
reduced
lambert
to
dreadful
dejection
shall
i
ever
seen
you
again
said
he
in
his
gentle
voice
as
he
clasped
me
in
his
arms
you
will
live
he
went
on
but
i
shall
die
if
i
can
i
will
come
back
to
you
only
the
young
can
utter
such
words
with
the
accent
of
conviction
that
gives
them
the
impressiveness
of
prophecy
of
a
pledge
leaving
a
terror
of
its
fulfilment
for
a
long
time
indeed
i
vaguely
looked
for
the
promised
apparition
even
now
there
are
days
of
depression
of
doubt
alarm
and
loneliness
when
i
am
forced
to
repel
the
intrusion
of
that
sad
parting
though
it
was
not
fated
to
be
the
last
when
i
crossed
the
yard
by
which
we
left
lambert
was
at
one
of
the
refectory
windows
to
see
me
pass
by
my
request
my
mother
obtained
leave
for
him
to
dine
with
us
at
the
inn
and
in
the
evening
i
escorted
him
back
to
the
fatal
gate
of
the
college
no
lover
and
his
mistress
ever
shed
more
tears
at
parting
well
i
shall
be
left
alone
in
this
desert
said
he
pointing
to
the
playground
where
two
hundred
boys
were
disporting
themselves
and
shouting
when
i
come
back
half
dead
with
fatigue
from
my
long
excursions
through
the
fields
of
thought
on
whose
heart
can
i
rest
i
could
tell
you
everything
in
a
look
who
will
understand
me
now
i
could
wish
i
had
never
met
you
i
should
not
know
all
i
am
losing
and
what
is
to
become
of
me
said
i
is
not
my
position
a
dreadful
one
have
nothing
here
to
uphold
me
and
i
slapped
my
forehead
he
shook
his
head
with
a
gentle
gesture
gracious
and
sad
and
we
parted
at
that
time
louis
lambert
was
about
five
feet
five
inches
in
height
he
grew
no
more
his
countenance
which
was
full
of
expression
revealed
his
sweet
nature
divine
patience
developed
by
harsh
usage
and
the
constant
concentration
needed
for
his
meditative
life
had
bereft
his
eyes
of
the
audacious
pride
which
is
so
attractive
in
some
faces
and
which
had
so
shocked
our
masters
peaceful
mildness
gave
charm
to
his
face
an
exquisite
serenity
that
was
never
marred
by
a
tinge
of
irony
or
satire
for
his
natural
kindliness
tempered
his
conscious
strength
and
superiority
he
had
pretty
hands
very
slender
and
almost
always
moist
his
frame
was
a
marvel
a
model
for
a
sculptor
but
our
uniform
with
gilt
buttons
and
gave
us
such
an
ungainly
appearance
that
lambert
fine
proportions
and
firm
muscles
could
only
be
appreciated
in
the
bath
when
we
swam
in
our
pool
in
the
loire
louis
was
conspicuous
by
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
which
was
unlike
the
different
shades
of
our
schoolfellows
bodies
mottled
by
the
cold
or
blue
from
the
water
gracefully
formed
elegant
in
his
attitudes
delicate
in
hue
never
shivering
after
his
bath
perhaps
because
he
avoided
the
shade
and
always
ran
into
the
sunshine
louis
was
like
one
of
those
cautious
blossoms
that
close
their
petals
to
the
blast
and
refuse
to
open
unless
to
a
clear
sky
he
ate
little
and
drank
water
only
either
by
instinct
or
by
choice
he
was
averse
to
any
exertion
that
made
a
demand
on
his
strength
his
movements
were
few
and
simple
like
those
of
orientals
or
of
savages
with
whom
gravity
seems
a
condition
of
nature
as
a
rule
he
disliked
everything
that
resembled
any
special
care
for
his
person
he
commonly
sat
with
his
head
a
little
inclined
to
the
left
and
so
constantly
rested
his
elbows
on
the
table
that
the
sleeves
of
his
coats
were
soon
in
holes
to
this
slight
picture
of
the
outer
man
i
must
add
a
sketch
of
his
moral
qualities
for
i
believe
i
can
now
judge
him
impartially
though
naturally
religious
louis
did
not
accept
the
minute
practices
of
the
roman
ritual
his
ideas
were
more
intimately
in
sympathy
with
saint
theresa
and
fenelon
and
several
fathers
and
certain
saints
who
in
our
day
would
be
regarded
as
heresiarchs
or
atheists
he
was
rigidly
calm
during
the
services
his
own
prayers
went
up
in
gusts
in
aspirations
without
any
regular
formality
in
all
things
he
gave
himself
up
to
nature
and
would
not
pray
any
more
than
he
would
think
at
any
fixed
hour
in
chapel
he
was
equally
apt
to
think
of
god
or
to
meditate
on
some
problem
of
philosophy
to
him
jesus
christ
was
the
most
perfect
type
of
his
system
verbum
caro
factum
seemed
a
sublime
statement
intended
to
express
the
traditional
formula
of
the
will
the
word
and
the
act
made
visible
christ
unconsciousness
of
his
death
having
so
perfected
his
inner
being
by
divine
works
that
one
day
the
invisible
form
of
it
appeared
to
his
disciples
and
the
other
mysteries
of
the
gospels
the
magnetic
cures
wrought
by
christ
and
the
gift
of
tongues
all
to
him
confirmed
his
doctrine
i
remember
once
hearing
him
say
on
this
subject
that
the
greatest
work
that
could
be
written
nowadays
was
a
history
of
the
primitive
church
and
he
never
rose
to
such
poetic
heights
as
when
in
the
evening
as
we
conversed
he
would
enter
on
an
inquiry
into
miracles
worked
by
the
power
of
will
during
that
great
age
of
faith
he
discerned
the
strongest
evidence
of
his
theory
in
most
of
the
martyrdoms
endured
during
the
first
century
of
our
era
which
he
spoke
of
as
great
era
of
the
do
not
the
phenomena
observed
in
almost
every
instance
of
the
torments
so
heroically
endured
by
the
early
christians
for
the
establishment
of
the
faith
amply
prove
that
material
force
will
never
prevail
against
the
force
of
ideas
or
the
will
of
man
he
would
say
from
this
effect
produced
by
the
will
of
all
each
man
may
draw
conclusions
in
favor
of
his
own
i
need
say
nothing
of
his
views
on
poetry
or
history
nor
of
his
judgment
on
the
masterpieces
of
our
language
there
would
be
little
interest
in
the
record
of
opinions
now
almost
universally
held
though
at
that
time
from
the
lips
of
a
boy
they
might
seem
remarkable
louis
was
capable
of
the
highest
flights
to
give
a
notion
of
his
talents
in
a
few
words
he
could
have
written
as
wittily
as
voltaire
he
could
have
thought
out
the
dialogue
between
sylla
and
eucrates
as
powerfully
as
montesquieu
his
rectitude
of
character
made
him
desire
above
all
else
in
a
work
that
it
should
bear
the
stamp
of
utility
at
the
same
time
his
refined
taste
demanded
novelty
of
thought
as
well
as
of
form
one
of
his
most
remarkable
literary
observations
which
will
serve
as
a
clue
to
all
the
others
and
show
the
lucidity
of
his
judgment
is
this
which
has
ever
dwelt
in
my
memory
the
apocalypse
is
written
ecstasy
he
regarded
the
bible
as
a
part
of
the
traditional
history
of
the
antediluvian
nations
which
had
taken
for
its
share
the
new
humanity
he
thought
that
the
mythology
of
the
greeks
was
borrowed
both
from
the
hebrew
scriptures
and
from
the
sacred
books
of
india
adapted
after
their
own
fashion
by
the
hellenes
it
is
impossible
said
he
to
doubt
the
priority
of
the
asiatic
scriptures
they
are
earlier
than
our
sacred
books
the
man
who
is
candid
enough
to
admit
this
historical
fact
sees
the
whole
world
expand
before
him
was
it
not
on
the
asiatic
highland
that
the
few
men
took
refuge
who
were
able
to
escape
the
catastrophe
that
ruined
our
globe
if
indeed
men
had
existed
before
that
cataclysm
or
shock
a
serious
query
the
answer
to
which
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
anthropogony
of
the
bible
is
merely
a
genealogy
of
a
swarm
escaping
from
the
human
hive
which
settled
on
the
mountainous
slopes
of
thibet
between
the
summits
of
the
himalaya
and
the
caucasus
the
character
of
the
primitive
ideas
of
that
horde
called
by
its
lawgiver
the
people
of
god
no
doubt
to
secure
its
unity
and
perhaps
also
to
induce
it
to
maintain
his
laws
and
his
system
of
government
for
the
books
of
moses
are
a
religious
political
and
civil
code
that
character
bears
the
authority
of
terror
convulsions
of
nature
are
interpreted
with
stupendous
power
as
a
vengeance
from
on
high
in
fact
since
this
wandering
tribe
knew
none
of
the
ease
enjoyed
by
a
community
settled
in
a
patriarchal
home
their
sorrows
as
pilgrims
inspired
them
with
none
but
gloomy
poems
majestic
but
in
the
hindoos
on
the
contrary
the
spectacle
of
the
rapid
recoveries
of
the
natural
world
and
the
prodigious
effects
of
sunshine
which
they
were
the
first
to
recognize
gave
rise
to
happy
images
of
blissful
love
to
the
worship
of
fire
and
of
the
endless
personifications
of
reproductive
force
these
fine
fancies
are
lacking
in
the
book
of
the
hebrews
a
constant
need
of
amid
all
the
dangers
and
the
lands
they
traversed
to
reach
the
promised
land
engendered
their
exclusive
and
their
hatred
of
all
other
nations
these
three
scriptures
are
the
archives
of
an
engulfed
world
therein
lies
the
secret
of
the
extraordinary
splendor
of
those
languages
and
their
myths
a
grand
human
history
lies
beneath
those
names
of
men
and
places
and
those
fables
which
charm
us
so
irresistibly
we
know
not
why
perhaps
it
is
because
we
find
in
them
the
native
air
of
renewed
humanity
thus
to
him
this
threefold
literature
included
all
the
thoughts
of
man
not
a
book
could
be
written
in
his
opinion
of
which
the
subject
might
not
there
be
discerned
in
its
germ
this
view
shows
how
learnedly
he
had
pursued
his
early
studies
of
the
bible
and
how
far
they
had
led
him
hovering
as
it
were
over
the
heads
of
society
and
knowing
it
solely
from
books
he
could
judge
it
coldly
the
law
said
he
never
puts
a
check
on
the
enterprises
of
the
rich
and
great
but
crushes
the
poor
who
on
the
contrary
need
protection
his
kind
heart
did
not
therefore
allow
him
to
sympathize
in
political
ideas
his
system
led
rather
to
the
passive
obedience
of
which
jesus
set
the
example
during
the
last
hours
of
my
life
at
vendome
louis
had
ceased
to
feel
the
spur
to
glory
he
had
in
a
way
had
an
abstract
enjoyment
of
fame
and
having
opened
it
as
the
ancient
priests
of
sacrifice
sought
to
read
the
future
in
the
hearts
of
men
he
had
found
nothing
in
the
entrails
of
his
chimera
scorning
a
sentiment
so
wholly
personal
glory
said
he
is
but
beatified
egoism
here
perhaps
before
taking
leave
of
this
exceptional
boyhood
i
may
pronounce
judgment
on
it
by
a
rapid
glance
a
short
time
before
our
separation
lambert
said
to
me
apart
from
the
general
laws
which
i
have
formulated
and
this
perhaps
will
be
my
glory
laws
which
must
be
those
of
the
human
organism
the
life
of
man
is
movement
determined
in
each
individual
by
the
pressure
of
some
inscrutable
influence
by
the
brain
the
heart
or
the
sinews
all
the
innumerable
modes
of
human
existence
result
from
the
proportions
in
which
these
three
generating
forces
are
more
or
less
intimately
combined
with
the
substances
they
assimilate
in
the
environment
they
live
in
he
stopped
short
struck
his
forehead
and
exclaimed
how
strange
in
every
great
man
whose
portrait
i
have
remarked
the
neck
is
short
perhaps
nature
requires
that
in
them
the
heart
should
be
nearer
to
the
brain
then
he
went
on
from
that
a
of
action
takes
its
rise
which
constitutes
social
life
the
man
of
sinew
contributes
action
or
strength
the
man
of
brain
genius
the
man
of
heart
faith
but
he
added
sadly
faith
sees
only
the
clouds
of
the
sanctuary
the
angel
alone
has
light
so
according
to
his
own
definitions
lambert
was
all
brain
and
all
heart
it
seems
to
me
that
his
intellectual
life
was
divided
into
three
marked
phases
under
the
impulsion
from
his
earliest
years
of
a
precocious
activity
due
no
doubt
to
some
malady
or
to
some
special
perfection
of
organism
his
powers
were
concentrated
on
the
functions
of
the
inner
senses
and
a
superabundant
flow
of
as
a
man
of
ideas
he
craved
to
satisfy
the
thirst
of
his
brain
to
assimilate
every
idea
hence
his
reading
and
from
his
reading
the
reflections
that
gave
him
the
power
of
reducing
things
to
their
simplest
expression
and
of
absorbing
them
to
study
them
in
their
essence
thus
the
advantages
of
this
splendid
stage
acquired
by
other
men
only
after
long
study
were
achieved
by
lambert
during
his
bodily
childhood
a
happy
childhood
colored
by
the
studious
joys
of
a
born
poet
the
point
which
most
thinkers
reach
at
last
was
to
him
the
whence
his
brain
was
to
set
out
one
day
in
search
of
new
worlds
of
knowledge
though
as
yet
he
knew
it
not
he
had
made
for
himself
the
most
exacting
life
possible
and
the
most
insatiably
greedy
merely
to
live
was
he
not
compelled
to
be
perpetually
casting
nutriment
into
the
gulf
he
had
opened
in
himself
like
some
beings
who
dwell
in
the
grosser
world
might
not
he
die
of
inanition
for
want
of
feeding
abnormal
and
disappointed
cravings
was
not
this
a
sort
of
debauchery
of
the
intellect
which
might
lead
to
spontaneous
combustion
like
that
of
bodies
saturated
with
alcohol
i
had
seen
nothing
of
this
first
phase
of
his
it
is
only
now
at
a
later
day
that
i
can
thus
give
an
account
of
its
prodigious
fruit
and
results
lambert
was
now
thirteen
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
witness
the
first
stage
of
the
second
period
lambert
was
cast
into
all
the
miseries
of
and
that
perhaps
was
his
salvation
it
absorbed
the
superabundance
of
his
thoughts
after
passing
from
concrete
ideas
to
their
purest
expression
from
words
to
their
ideal
import
and
from
that
import
to
principles
after
reducing
everything
to
the
abstract
to
enable
him
to
live
he
yearned
for
yet
other
intellectual
creations
quelled
by
the
woes
of
school
and
the
critical
development
of
his
physical
constitution
he
became
thoughtful
dreamed
of
feeling
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
new
sciences
positively
masses
of
ideas
checked
in
his
career
and
not
yet
strong
enough
to
contemplate
the
higher
spheres
he
contemplated
his
inmost
self
i
then
perceived
in
him
the
struggle
of
the
mind
reacting
on
itself
and
trying
to
detect
the
secrets
of
its
own
nature
like
a
physician
who
watches
the
course
of
his
own
disease
at
this
stage
of
weakness
and
strength
of
childish
grace
and
superhuman
powers
louis
lambert
is
the
creature
who
more
than
any
other
gave
me
a
poetical
and
truthful
image
of
the
being
we
call
an
angel
always
excepting
one
woman
whose
name
whose
features
whose
identity
and
whose
life
i
would
fain
hide
from
all
the
world
so
as
to
be
sole
master
of
the
secret
of
her
existence
and
to
bury
it
in
the
depths
of
my
heart
the
third
phase
i
was
not
destined
to
see
it
began
when
lambert
and
i
were
parted
for
he
did
not
leave
college
till
he
was
eighteen
in
the
summer
of
he
had
at
that
time
lost
his
father
and
mother
about
six
months
before
finding
no
member
of
his
family
with
whom
his
soul
could
sympathize
expansive
still
but
since
our
parting
thrown
back
on
himself
he
made
his
home
with
his
uncle
who
was
also
his
guardian
and
who
having
been
turned
out
of
his
benefice
as
a
priest
who
had
taken
the
oaths
had
come
to
settle
at
blois
there
louis
lived
for
some
time
but
consumed
ere
long
by
the
desire
to
finish
his
incomplete
studies
he
came
to
paris
to
see
madame
de
stael
and
to
drink
of
science
at
its
highest
fount
the
old
priest
being
very
fond
of
his
nephew
left
louis
free
to
spend
his
whole
little
inheritance
in
his
three
years
stay
in
paris
though
he
lived
very
poorly
this
fortune
consisted
of
but
a
few
thousand
francs
lambert
returned
to
blois
at
the
beginning
of
driven
from
paris
by
the
sufferings
to
which
the
impecunious
are
exposed
there
he
must
often
have
been
a
victim
to
the
secret
storms
the
terrible
rage
of
mind
by
which
artists
are
tossed
to
judge
from
the
only
fact
his
uncle
recollected
and
the
only
letter
he
preserved
of
all
those
which
louis
lambert
wrote
to
him
at
that
time
perhaps
because
it
was
the
last
and
the
longest
to
begin
with
the
story
louis
one
evening
was
at
the
seated
on
a
bench
in
the
upper
gallery
near
to
one
of
the
pillars
which
in
those
days
divided
off
the
third
row
of
boxes
on
rising
between
the
acts
he
saw
a
young
woman
who
had
just
come
into
the
box
next
him
the
sight
of
this
lady
who
was
young
pretty
well
dressed
in
a
low
bodice
no
doubt
and
escorted
by
a
man
for
whom
her
face
beamed
with
all
the
charms
of
love
produced
such
a
terrible
effect
on
lambert
soul
and
senses
that
he
was
obliged
to
leave
the
theatre
if
he
had
not
been
controlled
by
some
remaining
glimmer
of
reason
which
was
not
wholly
extinguished
by
this
first
fever
of
burning
passion
he
might
perhaps
have
yielded
to
the
most
irresistible
desire
that
came
over
him
to
kill
the
young
man
on
whom
the
lady
looks
beamed
was
not
this
a
reversion
in
the
heart
of
the
paris
world
to
the
savage
passion
that
regards
women
as
its
prey
an
effect
of
animal
instinct
combining
with
the
almost
luminous
flashes
of
a
soul
crushed
under
the
weight
of
thought
in
short
was
it
not
the
prick
of
the
penknife
so
vividly
imagined
by
the
boy
felt
by
the
man
as
the
thunderbolt
of
his
most
vital
craving
for
love
and
now
here
is
the
letter
that
depicts
the
state
of
his
mind
as
it
was
struck
by
the
spectacle
of
parisian
civilization
his
feelings
perpetually
wounded
no
doubt
in
that
whirlpool
of
must
always
have
suffered
there
he
probably
had
no
friend
to
comfort
him
no
enemy
to
give
tone
to
this
life
compelled
to
live
in
himself
alone
having
no
one
to
share
his
subtle
raptures
he
may
have
hoped
to
solve
the
problem
of
his
destiny
by
a
life
of
ecstasy
adopting
an
almost
vegetative
attitude
like
an
anchorite
of
the
early
church
and
abdicating
the
empire
of
the
intellectual
world
this
letter
seems
to
hint
at
such
a
scheme
which
is
a
temptation
to
all
lofty
souls
at
periods
of
social
reform
but
is
not
this
purpose
in
some
cases
the
result
of
a
vocation
do
not
some
of
them
endeavor
to
concentrate
their
powers
by
long
silence
so
as
to
emerge
fully
capable
of
governing
the
world
by
word
or
by
deed
louis
must
assuredly
have
found
much
bitterness
in
his
intercourse
with
men
or
have
striven
hard
with
society
in
terrible
irony
without
extracting
anything
from
it
before
uttering
so
strident
a
cry
and
expressing
poor
fellow
the
desire
which
satiety
of
power
and
of
all
earthly
things
has
led
even
monarchs
to
indulge
and
perhaps
too
he
went
back
to
solitude
to
carry
out
some
great
work
that
was
floating
inchoate
in
his
brain
we
would
gladly
believe
it
as
we
read
this
fragment
of
his
thoughts
betraying
the
struggle
of
his
soul
at
the
time
when
youth
was
ending
and
the
terrible
power
of
production
was
coming
into
being
to
which
we
might
have
owed
the
works
of
the
man
this
letter
connects
itself
with
the
adventure
at
the
theatre
the
incident
and
the
letter
throw
light
on
each
other
body
and
soul
were
tuned
to
the
same
pitch
this
tempest
of
doubts
and
asseverations
of
clouds
and
of
lightnings
that
flash
before
the
thunder
ending
by
a
starved
yearning
for
heavenly
illumination
throws
such
a
light
on
the
third
phase
of
his
education
as
enables
us
to
understand
it
perfectly
as
we
read
these
lines
written
at
chance
moments
taken
up
when
the
vicissitudes
of
life
in
paris
allowed
may
we
not
fancy
that
we
see
an
oak
at
that
stage
of
its
growth
when
its
inner
expansion
bursts
the
tender
green
bark
covering
it
with
wrinkles
and
cracks
when
its
majestic
stature
is
in
preparation
if
indeed
the
lightnings
of
heaven
and
the
axe
of
man
shall
spare
it
this
letter
then
will
close
alike
for
the
poet
and
the
philosopher
this
portentous
childhood
and
unappreciated
youth
it
finishes
off
the
outline
of
this
nature
in
its
germ
philosophers
will
regret
the
foliage
in
the
bud
but
they
will
perhaps
find
the
flowers
expanding
in
regions
far
above
the
highest
places
of
the
earth
paris
dear
uncle
i
shall
soon
be
leaving
this
part
of
the
world
where
i
could
never
bear
to
live
i
find
no
one
here
who
likes
what
i
like
who
works
at
my
work
or
is
amazed
at
what
amazes
me
thrown
back
on
myself
i
eat
my
heart
out
in
misery
my
long
and
patient
study
of
society
here
has
brought
me
to
melancholy
conclusions
in
which
doubt
predominates
here
money
is
the
mainspring
of
everything
money
is
indispensable
even
for
going
without
money
but
though
that
dross
is
necessary
to
any
one
who
wishes
to
think
in
peace
i
have
not
courage
enough
to
make
it
the
sole
motive
power
of
my
thoughts
to
make
a
fortune
i
must
take
up
a
profession
in
two
words
i
must
by
acquiring
some
privilege
of
position
or
of
either
legal
or
ingeniously
contrived
purchase
the
right
of
taking
day
by
day
out
of
somebody
else
purse
a
certain
sum
which
by
the
end
of
the
year
would
amount
to
a
small
capital
and
this
in
twenty
years
would
hardly
secure
an
income
of
four
or
five
thousand
francs
to
a
man
who
deals
honestly
an
advocate
a
notary
a
merchant
any
recognized
professional
has
earned
a
living
for
his
later
days
in
the
course
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
after
ending
his
apprenticeship
but
i
have
never
felt
fit
for
work
of
this
kind
i
prefer
thought
to
action
an
idea
to
a
transaction
contemplation
to
activity
i
am
absolutely
devoid
of
the
constant
attention
indispensable
to
the
making
of
a
fortune
any
mercantile
venture
any
need
for
using
other
people
money
would
bring
me
to
grief
and
i
should
be
ruined
though
i
have
nothing
at
least
at
the
moment
i
owe
nothing
the
man
who
gives
his
life
to
the
achievement
of
great
things
in
the
sphere
of
intellect
needs
very
little
still
though
twenty
sous
a
day
would
be
enough
i
do
not
possess
that
small
income
for
my
laborious
idleness
when
i
wish
to
cogitate
want
drives
me
out
of
the
sanctuary
where
my
mind
has
its
being
what
is
to
become
of
me
i
am
not
frightened
at
poverty
if
it
were
not
that
beggars
are
imprisoned
branded
scorned
i
would
beg
to
enable
me
to
solve
at
my
leisure
the
problems
that
haunt
me
still
this
sublime
resignation
by
which
i
might
emancipate
my
mind
through
abstracting
it
from
the
body
would
not
serve
my
end
i
should
still
need
money
to
devote
myself
to
certain
experiments
but
for
that
i
would
accept
the
outward
indigence
of
a
sage
possessed
of
both
heaven
and
heart
a
man
need
only
never
stoop
to
remain
lofty
in
poverty
he
who
struggles
and
endures
while
marching
on
to
a
glorious
end
presents
a
noble
spectacle
but
who
can
have
the
strength
to
fight
here
we
can
climb
cliffs
but
it
is
unendurable
to
remain
for
ever
tramping
the
mud
everything
here
checks
the
flight
of
the
spirit
that
strives
towards
the
future
i
should
not
be
afraid
of
myself
in
a
desert
cave
i
am
afraid
of
myself
here
in
the
desert
i
should
be
alone
with
myself
undisturbed
here
man
has
a
thousand
wants
which
drag
him
down
you
go
out
walking
absorbed
in
dreams
the
voice
of
the
beggar
asking
an
alms
brings
you
back
to
this
world
of
hunger
and
thirst
you
need
money
only
to
take
a
walk
your
organs
of
sense
perpetually
wearied
by
trifles
never
get
any
rest
the
sensitive
nerves
are
perpetually
shocked
and
what
ought
to
be
his
glory
becomes
his
torment
his
imagination
is
his
cruelest
enemy
the
injured
workman
the
poor
mother
in
childbed
the
prostitute
who
has
fallen
ill
the
foundling
the
infirm
and
aged
even
vice
and
crime
here
find
a
refuge
and
charity
but
the
world
is
merciless
to
the
inventor
to
the
man
who
thinks
here
everything
must
show
an
immediate
and
practical
result
fruitless
attempts
are
mocked
at
though
they
may
lead
to
the
greatest
discoveries
the
deep
and
untiring
study
that
demands
long
concentrations
of
every
faculty
is
not
valued
here
the
state
might
pay
talent
as
it
pays
the
bayonet
but
it
is
afraid
of
being
taken
in
by
mere
cleverness
as
if
genius
could
be
counterfeited
for
any
length
of
time
ah
my
dear
uncle
when
monastic
solitude
was
destroyed
uprooted
from
its
home
at
the
foot
of
mountains
under
green
and
silent
shade
asylums
ought
to
have
been
provided
for
those
suffering
souls
who
by
an
idea
promote
the
progress
of
nations
or
prepare
some
new
and
fruitful
development
of
science
september
the
love
of
study
brought
me
hither
as
you
know
i
have
met
really
learned
men
amazing
for
the
most
part
but
the
lack
of
unity
in
scientific
work
almost
nullifies
their
efforts
there
is
no
head
of
instruction
or
of
scientific
research
at
the
museum
a
professor
argues
to
prove
that
another
in
the
rue
talks
nonsense
the
lecturer
at
the
college
of
medicine
abuses
him
of
the
college
de
france
when
i
first
arrived
i
went
to
hear
an
old
academician
who
taught
five
hundred
youths
that
corneille
was
a
haughty
and
powerful
genius
racine
elegiac
and
graceful
moliere
inimitable
voltaire
supremely
witty
bossuet
and
pascal
incomparable
in
argument
a
professor
of
philosophy
may
make
a
name
by
explaining
how
plato
is
platonic
another
discourses
on
the
history
of
words
without
troubling
himself
about
ideas
one
explains
aeschylus
another
tells
you
that
communes
were
communes
and
neither
more
nor
less
these
original
and
brilliant
discoveries
diluted
to
last
several
hours
constitute
the
higher
education
which
is
to
lead
to
giant
strides
in
human
knowledge
if
the
government
could
have
an
idea
i
should
suspect
it
of
being
afraid
of
any
real
superiority
which
once
roused
might
bring
society
under
the
yoke
of
an
intelligent
rule
then
nations
would
go
too
far
and
too
fast
so
professors
are
appointed
to
produce
simpletons
how
else
can
we
account
for
a
scheme
devoid
of
method
or
any
notion
of
the
future
the
might
be
the
central
government
of
the
moral
and
intellectual
world
but
it
has
been
ruined
lately
by
its
subdivision
into
separate
academies
so
human
science
marches
on
without
a
guide
without
a
system
and
floats
haphazard
with
no
road
traced
out
this
vagueness
and
uncertainty
prevails
in
politics
as
well
as
in
science
in
the
order
of
nature
means
are
simple
the
end
is
grand
and
marvelous
here
in
science
as
in
government
the
means
are
stupendous
the
end
is
mean
the
force
which
in
nature
proceeds
at
an
equal
pace
and
of
which
the
sum
is
constantly
being
added
to
itself
the
a
a
from
which
everything
is
produced
is
destructive
in
society
politics
at
the
present
time
place
human
forces
in
antagonism
to
neutralize
each
other
instead
of
combining
them
to
promote
their
action
to
some
definite
end

applied

everything

again
as
it
has
been
at
every
period
when
man
has
turned
to
cry
out
am
in
torment
the
code
which
is
considered
napoleon
greatest
achievement
is
the
most
draconian
work
i
know
of
territorial
subdivision
carried
out
to
the
uttermost
and
its
principle
confirmed
by
the
equal
division
of
property
generally
must
result
in
the
degeneracy
of
the
nation
and
the
death
of
the
arts
and
sciences
the
land
too
much
broken
up
is
cultivated
only
with
cereals
and
small
crops
the
forests
and
consequently
the
rivers
are
disappearing
oxen
and
horses
are
no
longer
bred
means
are
lacking
both
for
attack
and
for
resistance
if
we
should
be
invaded
the
people
must
be
crushed
it
has
lost
its
mainspring
its
leaders
this
is
the
history
of
deserts
thus
the
science
of
politics
has
no
definite
principles
and
it
can
have
no
fixity
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
hour
the
perpetual
application
of
strength
proportioned
to
the
necessities
of
the
moment
the
man
who
should
foresee
two
centuries
ahead
would
die
on
the
place
of
execution
loaded
with
the
imprecations
of
the
mob
or
else
which
seems
worse
would
be
lashed
with
the
myriad
whips
of
ridicule
nations
are
but
individuals
neither
wiser
nor
stronger
than
man
and
their
destinies
are
identical
if
we
reflect
on
man
is
not
that
to
consider
mankind
by
studying
the
spectacle
of
society
perpetually
in
its
foundations
as
well
as
in
its
results
in
its
causes
as
well
as
in
its
actions
while
philanthropy
is
but
a
splendid
mistake
and
progress
is
vanity
i
have
been
confirmed
in
this
truth
life
is
within
and
not
without
us
to
rise
above
men
to
govern
them
is
only
the
part
of
an
aggrandized
and
those
men
who
are
capable
of
rising
to
the
level
whence
they
can
enjoy
a
view
of
the
world
should
not
look
at
their
own
feet
november
i
am
no
doubt
occupied
with
weighty
thoughts
i
am
on
the
way
to
certain
discoveries
an
invincible
power
bears
me
toward
a
luminary
which
shone
at
an
early
age
on
the
darkness
of
my
moral
life
but
what
name
can
i
give
to
the
power
that
ties
my
hands
and
shuts
my
mouth
and
drags
me
in
a
direction
opposite
to
my
vocation
i
must
leave
paris
bid
farewell
to
the
books
in
the
libraries
those
noble
centres
of
illumination
those
kindly
and
always
accessible
sages
and
the
younger
geniuses
with
whom
i
sympathize
who
is
it
that
drives
me
away
chance
or
providence
the
two
ideas
represented
by
those
words
are
irreconcilable
if
chance
does
not
exist
we
must
admit
fatalism
that
is
to
say
the
compulsory
of
things
under
the
rule
of
a
general
plan
why
then
do
we
rebel
if
man
is
not
free
what
becomes
of
the
scaffolding
of
his
moral
sense
or
if
he
can
control
his
destiny
if
by
his
own
freewill
he
can
interfere
with
the
execution
of
the
general
plan
what
becomes
of
god
why
did
i
come
here
if
i
examine
myself
i
find
the
answer
i
find
in
myself
axioms
that
need
developing
but
why
then
have
i
such
vast
faculties
without
being
suffered
to
use
them
if
my
suffering
could
serve
as
an
example
i
could
understand
it
but
no
i
suffer
unknown
this
is
perhaps
as
much
the
act
of
providence
as
the
fate
of
the
flower
that
dies
unseen
in
the
heart
of
the
virgin
forest
where
no
one
can
enjoy
its
perfume
or
admire
its
splendor
just
as
that
blossom
vainly
sheds
its
fragrance
to
the
solitude
so
do
i
here
in
the
garret
give
birth
to
ideas
that
no
one
can
grasp
yesterday
evening
i
sat
eating
bread
and
grapes
in
front
of
my
window
with
a
young
doctor
named
meyraux
we
talked
as
men
do
whom
misfortune
has
joined
in
brotherhood
and
i
said
to
him
am
going
away
you
are
staying
take
up
my
ideas
and
develop
them
can
not
said
he
with
bitter
regret
feeble
health
can
not
stand
so
much
work
and
i
shall
die
young
of
my
struggle
with
penury
we
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
grasped
hands
we
first
met
at
the
comparative
anatomy
course
and
in
the
galleries
of
the
museum
attracted
thither
by
the
same
study
the
unity
of
geological
structure
in
him
this
was
the
presentiment
of
genius
sent
to
open
a
new
path
in
the
fallows
of
intellect
in
me
it
was
a
deduction
from
a
general
system
my
point
is
to
ascertain
the
real
relation
that
may
exist
between
god
and
man
is
not
this
a
need
of
the
age
without
the
highest
assurance
it
is
impossible
to
put
bit
and
bridle
on
the
social
factions
that
have
been
let
loose
by
the
spirit
of
scepticism
and
discussion
and
which
are
now
crying
aloud
us
a
way
in
which
we
may
walk
and
find
no
pitfalls
in
our
way
you
will
wonder
what
comparative
anatomy
has
to
do
with
a
question
of
such
importance
to
the
future
of
society
must
we
not
attain
to
the
conviction
that
man
is
the
end
of
all
earthly
means
before
we
ask
whether
he
too
is
not
the
means
to
some
end
if
man
is
bound
up
with
everything
is
there
not
something
above
him
with
which
he
again
is
bound
up
if
he
is
the
of
the
explained
transmutations
that
lead
up
to
him
must
he
not
be
also
the
link
between
the
visible
and
invisible
creations
the
activity
of
the
universe
is
not
absurd
it
must
tend
to
an
end
and
that
end
is
surely
not
a
social
body
constituted
as
ours
is
there
is
a
fearful
gulf
between
us
and
heaven
in
our
present
existence
we
can
neither
be
always
happy
nor
always
in
torment
must
there
not
be
some
tremendous
change
to
bring
about
paradise
and
hell
two
images
without
which
god
can
not
exist
to
the
mind
of
the
vulgar
i
know
that
a
compromise
was
made
by
the
invention
of
the
soul
but
it
is
repugnant
to
me
to
make
god
answerable
for
human
baseness
for
our
disenchantments
our
aversions
our
degeneracy
again
how
can
we
recognize
as
divine
the
principle
within
us
which
can
be
overthrown
by
a
few
glasses
of
rum
how
conceive
of
immaterial
faculties
which
matter
can
conquer
and
whose
exercise
is
suspended
by
a
grain
of
opium
how
imagine
that
we
shall
be
able
to
feel
when
we
are
bereft
of
the
vehicles
of
sensation
why
must
god
perish
if
matter
can
be
proved
to
think
is
the
vitality
of
matter
in
its
innumerable
manifestations
the
effect
of
its
instincts
at
all
more
explicable
than
the
effects
of
the
mind
is
not
the
motion
given
to
the
worlds
enough
to
prove
existence
without
our
plunging
into
absurd
speculations
suggested
by
pride
and
if
we
pass
after
our
trials
from
a
perishable
state
of
being
to
a
higher
existence
is
not
that
enough
for
a
creature
that
is
distinguished
from
other
creatures
only
by
more
perfect
instincts
if
in
moral
philosophy
there
is
not
a
single
principle
which
does
not
lead
to
the
absurd
or
can
not
be
disproved
by
evidence
is
it
not
high
time
that
we
should
set
to
work
to
seek
such
dogmas
as
are
written
in
the
innermost
nature
of
things
must
we
not
reverse
philosophical
science
we
trouble
ourselves
very
little
about
the
supposed
void
that
must
have
for
us
and
we
try
to
fathom
the
supposed
void
that
lies
before
us
we
make
god
responsible
for
the
future
but
we
do
not
expect
him
to
account
for
the
past
and
yet
it
is
quite
as
desirable
to
know
whether
we
have
any
roots
in
the
past
as
to
discover
whether
we
are
inseparable
from
the
future
we
have
been
deists
or
atheists
in
one
direction
only
is
the
world
eternal
was
the
world
created
we
can
conceive
of
no
middle
term
between
these
two
propositions
one
then
is
true
and
the
other
false
take
your
choice
whichever
it
may
be
god
as
our
reason
depicts
him
must
be
deposed
and
that
amounts
to
denial
the
world
is
eternal
then
beyond
question
god
has
had
it
forced
upon
him
the
world
was
created
then
god
is
an
impossibility
how
could
he
have
subsisted
through
an
eternity
not
knowing
that
he
would
presently
want
to
create
the
world
how
could
he
have
failed
to
foresee
all
the
results
whence
did
he
derive
the
essence
of
creation
evidently
from
himself
if
then
the
world
proceeds
from
god
how
can
you
account
for
evil
that
evil
should
proceed
from
good
is
absurd
if
evil
does
not
exist
what
do
you
make
of
social
life
and
its
laws
on
all
hands
we
find
a
precipice
on
every
side
a
gulf
in
which
reason
is
lost
then
social
science
must
be
altogether
reconstructed
listen
to
me
uncle
until
some
splendid
genius
shall
have
taken
account
of
the
obvious
inequality
of
intellects
and
the
general
sense
of
humanity
the
word
god
will
be
constantly
arraigned
and
society
will
rest
on
shifting
sands
the
secret
of
the
various
moral
zones
through
which
man
passes
will
be
discovered
by
the
analysis
of
the
animal
type
as
a
whole
that
animal
type
has
hitherto
been
studied
with
reference
only
to
its
differences
not
to
its
similitudes
in
its
organic
manifestations
not
in
its
faculties
animal
faculties
are
perfected
in
direct
transmission
in
obedience
to
laws
which
remain
to
be
discovered
these
faculties
correspond
to
the
forces
which
express
them
and
those
forces
are
essentially
material
and
divisible
material
faculties
reflect
on
this
juxtaposition
of
words
is
not
this
a
problem
as
insoluble
as
that
of
the
first
communication
of
motion
to
matter
an
unsounded
gulf
of
which
the
difficulties
were
transposed
rather
than
removed
by
newton
system
again
the
universal
assimilation
of
light
by
everything
that
exists
on
earth
demands
a
new
study
of
our
globe
the
same
animal
differs
in
the
tropics
of
india
and
in
the
north
under
the
angular
or
the
vertical
incidence
of
the
sun
rays
nature
is
developed
the
same
but
not
the
same
identical
in
its
principles
but
totally
dissimilar
in
its
outcome
the
phenomenon
that
amazes
our
eyes
in
the
zoological
world
when
we
compare
the
butterflies
of
brazil
with
those
of
europe
is
even
more
startling
in
the
world
of
mind
a
particular
facial
angle
a
certain
amount
of
brain
convolutions
are
indispensable
to
produce
columbus
raphael
napoleon
laplace
or
beethoven
the
sunless
valley
produces
the
cretin
draw
your
own
conclusions
why
such
differences
due
to
the
more
or
less
ample
diffusion
of
light
to
men
the
masses
of
suffering
humanity
more
or
less
active
fed
and
enlightened
are
a
difficulty
to
be
accounted
for
crying
out
against
god
why
in
great
joy
do
we
always
want
to
quit
the
earth
whence
comes
the
longing
to
rise
which
every
creature
has
known
or
will
know
motion
is
a
great
soul
and
its
alliance
with
matter
is
just
as
difficult
to
account
for
as
the
origin
of
thought
in
man
in
these
days
science
is
one
it
is
impossible
to
touch
politics
independent
of
moral
questions
and
these
are
bound
up
with
scientific
questions
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
on
the
eve
of
a
great
human
struggle
the
forces
are
there
only
i
do
not
see
the
general
november
believe
me
dear
uncle
it
is
hard
to
give
up
the
life
that
is
in
us
without
a
pang
i
am
returning
to
blois
with
a
heavy
grip
at
my
heart
i
shall
die
then
taking
with
me
some
useful
truths
no
personal
interest
debases
my
regrets
is
earthly
fame
a
guerdon
to
those
who
believe
that
they
will
mount
to
a
higher
sphere
i
am
by
no
means
in
love
with
the
two
syllables
and
whether
spoken
with
respect
or
with
contempt
over
my
grave
they
can
make
no
change
in
my
ultimate
destiny
i
feel
myself
strong
and
energetic
i
might
become
a
power
i
feel
in
myself
a
life
so
luminous
that
it
might
enlighten
a
world
and
yet
i
am
shut
up
in
a
sort
of
mineral
as
perhaps
indeed
are
the
colors
you
admire
on
the
neck
of
an
indian
bird
i
should
need
to
embrace
the
whole
world
to
clasp
and
it
but
those
who
have
done
this
who
have
thus
embraced
and
remoulded
it
began
did
they
not
by
being
a
wheel
in
the
machine
i
can
only
be
crushed
mahomet
had
the
sword
jesus
had
the
cross
i
shall
die
unknown
i
shall
be
at
blois
for
a
day
and
then
in
my
coffin
do
you
know
why
i
have
come
back
to
swedenborg
after
vast
studies
of
all
religions
and
after
proving
to
myself
by
reading
all
the
works
published
within
the
last
sixty
years
by
the
patient
english
by
germany
and
by
france
how
deeply
true
were
my
youthful
views
about
the
bible
swedenborg
undoubtedly
epitomizes
all
the
religions
or
rather
the
one
religion
of
humanity
though
forms
of
worship
are
infinitely
various
neither
their
true
meaning
nor
their
metaphysical
interpretation
has
ever
varied
in
short
man
has
and
has
had
but
one
religion
sivaism
vishnuism
and
brahmanism
the
three
primitive
creeds
originating
as
they
did
in
thibet
in
the
valley
of
the
indus
and
on
the
vast
plains
of
the
ganges
ended
their
warfare
some
thousand
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
by
adopting
the
hindoo
trimourti
the
trimourti
is
our
trinity
from
this
dogma
magianism
arose
in
persia
in
egypt
the
african
beliefs
and
the
mosaic
law
the
worship
of
the
cabiri
and
the
polytheism
of
greece
and
rome
while
by
this
ramification
of
the
trimourti
the
asiatic
myths
became
adapted
to
the
imaginations
of
various
races
in
the
lands
they
reached
by
the
agency
of
certain
sages
whom
men
elevated
to
be
mithra
bacchus
hermes
hercules
and
the
rest
buddha
the
great
reformer
of
the
three
primeval
religions
lived
in
india
and
founded
his
church
there
a
sect
which
still
numbers
two
hundred
millions
more
believers
than
christianity
can
show
while
it
certainly
influenced
the
powerful
will
both
of
jesus
and
of
confucius
then
christianity
raised
her
standard
subsequently
mahomet
fused
judaism
and
christianity
the
bible
and
the
gospel
in
one
book
the
koran
adapting
them
to
the
apprehension
of
the
arab
race
finally
swedenborg
borrowed
from
magianism
brahmanism
buddhism
and
christian
mysticism
all
the
truth
and
divine
beauty
that
those
four
great
religious
books
hold
in
common
and
added
to
them
a
doctrine
a
basis
of
reasoning
that
may
be
termed
mathematical
any
man
who
plunges
into
these
religious
waters
of
which
the
sources
are
not
all
known
will
find
proofs
that
zoroaster
moses
buddha
confucius
jesus
christ
and
swedenborg
had
identical
principles
and
aimed
at
identical
ends
the
last
of
them
all
swedenborg
will
perhaps
be
the
buddha
of
the
north
obscure
and
diffuse
as
his
writings
are
we
find
in
them
the
elements
of
a
magnificent
conception
of
society
his
theocracy
is
sublime
and
his
creed
is
the
only
acceptable
one
to
superior
souls
he
alone
brings
man
into
immediate
communion
with
god
he
gives
a
thirst
for
god
he
has
freed
the
majesty
of
god
from
the
trappings
in
which
other
human
dogmas
have
disguised
him
he
left
him
where
he
is
making
his
myriad
creations
and
creatures
gravitate
towards
him
through
successive
transformations
which
promise
a
more
immediate
and
more
natural
future
than
the
catholic
idea
of
eternity
swedenborg
has
absolved
god
from
the
reproach
attaching
to
him
in
the
estimation
of
tender
souls
for
the
perpetuity
of
revenge
to
punish
the
sin
of
a
moment
a
system
of
injustice
and
cruelty
each
man
may
know
for
himself
what
hope
he
has
of
life
eternal
and
whether
this
world
has
any
rational
sense
i
mean
to
make
the
attempt
and
this
attempt
may
save
the
world
just
as
much
as
the
cross
at
jerusalem
or
the
sword
at
mecca
these
were
both
the
offspring
of
the
desert
of
the
years
of
life
we
only
know
the
history
of
nine
his
life
of
seclusion
prepared
him
for
his
life
of
glory
and
i
too
crave
for
the
desert
notwithstanding
the
difficulties
of
the
task
i
have
felt
it
my
duty
to
depict
lambert
boyhood
the
unknown
life
to
which
i
owe
the
only
happy
hours
the
only
pleasant
memories
of
my
early
days
excepting
during
those
two
years
i
had
nothing
but
annoyances
and
weariness
though
some
happiness
was
mine
at
a
later
time
it
was
always
incomplete
i
have
been
diffuse
i
know
but
in
default
of
entering
into
the
whole
wide
heart
and
brain
of
louis
lambert
two
words
which
inadequately
express
the
infinite
aspects
of
his
inner
life
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
make
the
second
part
of
his
intellectual
history
intelligible
a
phase
that
was
unknown
to
the
world
and
to
me
but
of
which
the
mystical
outcome
was
made
evident
to
my
eyes
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
those
who
have
not
already
dropped
this
volume
will
i
hope
understand
the
events
i
still
have
to
tell
forming
as
they
do
a
sort
of
second
existence
lived
by
this
creature
may
i
not
say
this
creation
in
whom
everything
was
to
be
so
extraordinary
even
his
end
when
louis
returned
to
blois
his
uncle
was
eager
to
procure
him
some
amusement
but
the
poor
priest
was
regarded
as
a
perfect
leper
in
that
town
no
one
would
have
anything
to
say
to
a
revolutionary
who
had
taken
the
oaths
his
society
therefore
consisted
of
a
few
individuals
of
what
were
then
called
liberal
or
patriotic
or
constitutional
opinions
on
whom
he
would
call
for
a
rubber
of
whist
or
of
boston
at
the
first
house
where
he
was
introduced
by
his
uncle
louis
met
a
young
lady
whose
circumstances
obliged
her
to
remain
in
this
circle
so
contemned
by
those
of
the
fashionable
world
though
her
fortune
was
such
as
to
make
it
probable
that
she
might
by
and
by
marry
into
the
highest
aristocracy
of
the
province
mademoiselle
pauline
de
villenoix
was
sole
heiress
to
the
wealth
amassed
by
her
grandfather
a
jew
named
salomon
who
contrary
to
the
customs
of
his
nation
had
in
his
old
age
married
a
christian
and
a
catholic
he
had
only
one
son
who
was
brought
up
in
his
mother
faith
at
his
father
death
young
salomon
purchased
what
was
known
at
that
time
as
a
a
literally
cake
of
soap
for
a
a
small
estate
called
villenoix
which
he
contrived
to
get
registered
with
a
baronial
title
and
took
its
name
he
died
unmarried
but
he
left
a
natural
daughter
to
whom
he
bequeathed
the
greater
part
of
his
fortune
including
the
lands
of
villenoix
he
appointed
one
of
his
uncles
monsieur
joseph
salomon
to
be
the
guardian
the
old
jew
was
so
devoted
to
his
ward
that
he
seemed
willing
to
make
great
sacrifices
for
the
sake
of
marrying
her
well
but
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
birth
and
the
cherished
prejudice
against
jews
that
prevails
in
the
provinces
would
not
allow
of
her
being
received
in
the
very
exclusive
circle
which
rightly
or
wrongly
considers
itself
noble
notwithstanding
her
own
large
fortune
and
her
guardian
monsieur
joseph
salomon
was
resolved
that
if
she
could
not
secure
a
country
squire
his
niece
should
go
to
paris
and
make
choice
of
a
husband
among
the
peers
of
france
liberal
or
monarchical
as
to
happiness
that
he
believed
he
could
secure
her
by
the
terms
of
the
marriage
contract
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
was
now
twenty
her
remarkable
beauty
and
gifts
of
mind
were
surer
guarantees
of
happiness
than
those
offered
by
money
her
features
were
of
the
purest
type
of
jewish
beauty
the
oval
lines
so
noble
and
maidenly
have
an
indescribable
stamp
of
the
ideal
and
seem
to
speak
of
the
joys
of
the
east
its
unchangeably
blue
sky
the
glories
of
its
lands
and
the
fabulous
riches
of
life
there
she
had
fine
eyes
shaded
by
deep
eyelids
fringed
with
thick
curled
lashes
biblical
innocence
sat
on
her
brow
her
complexion
was
of
the
pure
whiteness
of
the
levite
robe
she
was
habitually
silent
and
thoughtful
but
her
movements
and
gestures
betrayed
a
quiet
grace
as
her
speech
bore
witness
to
a
woman
sweet
and
loving
nature
she
had
not
indeed
the
rosy
freshness
the
bloom
which
blush
on
a
girl
cheek
during
her
careless
years
darker
shadows
with
here
and
there
a
redder
vein
took
the
place
of
color
symptomatic
of
an
energetic
temper
and
nervous
irritability
such
as
many
men
do
not
like
to
meet
with
in
a
wife
while
to
others
they
are
an
indication
of
the
most
sensitive
chastity
and
passion
mingled
with
pride
as
soon
as
louis
saw
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
he
discerned
the
angel
within
the
richest
powers
of
his
soul
and
his
tendency
to
ecstatic
reverie
every
faculty
within
him
was
at
once
concentrated
in
boundless
love
the
first
love
of
a
young
man
a
passion
which
is
strong
indeed
in
all
but
which
in
him
was
raised
to
incalculable
power
by
the
perennial
ardor
of
his
senses
the
character
of
his
ideas
and
the
manner
in
which
he
lived
this
passion
became
a
gulf
into
which
the
hapless
fellow
threw
everything
a
gulf
whither
the
mind
dare
not
venture
since
his
flexible
and
firm
as
it
was
was
lost
there
there
all
was
mysterious
for
everything
went
on
in
that
moral
world
closed
to
most
men
whose
laws
were
revealed
to
him
perhaps
to
his
sorrow
when
an
accident
threw
me
in
the
way
of
his
uncle
the
good
man
showed
me
into
the
room
which
lambert
had
at
that
time
lived
in
i
wanted
to
find
some
vestiges
of
his
writings
if
he
should
have
left
any
there
among
his
papers
untouched
by
the
old
man
from
that
fine
instinct
of
grief
that
characterized
the
aged
i
found
a
number
of
letters
too
illegible
ever
to
have
been
sent
to
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
my
familiarity
with
lambert
writing
enabled
me
in
time
to
decipher
the
hieroglyphics
of
this
shorthand
the
result
of
impatience
and
a
frenzy
of
passion
carried
away
by
his
feelings
he
had
written
without
being
conscious
of
the
irregularity
of
words
too
slow
to
express
his
thoughts
he
must
have
been
compelled
to
copy
these
chaotic
attempts
for
the
lines
often
ran
into
each
other
but
he
was
also
afraid
perhaps
of
not
having
sufficiently
disguised
his
feelings
and
at
first
at
any
rate
he
had
probably
written
his
twice
over
it
required
all
the
fervency
of
my
devotion
to
his
memory
and
the
sort
of
fanaticism
which
comes
of
such
a
task
to
enable
me
to
divine
and
restore
the
meaning
of
the
five
letters
that
here
follow
these
documents
preserved
by
me
with
pious
care
are
the
only
material
evidence
of
his
overmastering
passion
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
had
no
doubt
destroyed
the
real
letters
that
she
received
eloquent
witnesses
to
the
delirium
she
inspired
the
first
of
these
papers
evidently
a
rough
sketch
betrays
by
its
style
and
by
its
length
the
many
emendations
the
heartfelt
alarms
the
innumerable
terrors
caused
by
a
desire
to
please
the
changes
of
expression
and
the
hesitation
between
the
whirl
of
ideas
that
beset
a
man
as
he
indites
his
first
a
letter
he
never
will
forget
each
line
the
result
of
a
reverie
each
word
the
subject
of
long
cogitation
while
the
most
unbridled
passion
known
to
man
feels
the
necessity
of
the
most
reserved
utterance
and
like
a
giant
stooping
to
enter
a
hovel
speaks
humbly
and
low
so
as
not
to
alarm
a
girl
soul
no
antiquary
ever
handled
his
palimpsests
with
greater
respect
than
i
showed
in
reconstructing
these
mutilated
documents
of
such
joy
and
suffering
as
must
always
be
sacred
to
those
who
have
known
similar
joy
and
grief
i
mademoiselle
when
you
have
read
this
letter
if
you
ever
should
read
it
my
life
will
be
in
your
hands
for
i
love
you
and
to
me
the
hope
of
being
loved
is
life
others
perhaps
ere
now
have
in
speaking
of
themselves
misused
the
words
i
must
employ
to
depict
the
state
of
my
soul
yet
i
beseech
you
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
my
expressions
though
weak
they
are
sincere
perhaps
i
ought
not
thus
to
proclaim
my
love
indeed
my
heart
counseled
me
to
wait
in
silence
till
my
passion
should
touch
you
that
i
might
the
better
conceal
it
if
its
silent
demonstrations
should
displease
you
or
till
i
could
express
it
even
more
delicately
than
in
words
if
i
found
favor
in
your
eyes
however
after
having
listened
for
long
to
the
coy
fears
that
fill
a
youthful
heart
with
alarms
i
write
in
obedience
to
the
instinct
which
drags
useless
lamentations
from
the
dying
it
has
needed
all
my
courage
to
silence
the
pride
of
poverty
and
to
overleap
the
barriers
which
prejudice
erects
between
you
and
me
i
have
had
to
smother
many
reflections
to
love
you
in
spite
of
your
wealth
and
as
i
write
to
you
am
i
not
in
danger
of
the
scorn
which
women
often
reserve
for
profession
of
love
which
they
accept
only
as
one
more
tribute
of
flattery
but
we
can
not
help
rushing
with
all
our
might
towards
happiness
or
being
attracted
to
the
life
of
love
as
a
plant
is
to
the
light
we
must
have
been
very
unhappy
before
we
can
conquer
the
torment
the
anguish
of
those
secret
deliberations
when
reason
proves
to
us
by
a
thousand
arguments
how
barren
our
yearning
must
be
if
it
remains
buried
in
our
hearts
and
when
hopes
bid
us
dare
everything
i
was
happy
when
i
admired
you
in
silence
i
was
so
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
your
beautiful
soul
that
only
to
see
you
left
me
hardly
anything
further
to
imagine
and
i
should
not
now
have
dared
to
address
you
if
i
had
not
heard
that
you
were
leaving
what
misery
has
that
one
word
brought
upon
me
indeed
it
is
my
despair
that
has
shown
me
the
extent
of
my
attachment
it
is
unbounded
mademoiselle
you
will
never
know
at
least
i
hope
you
may
never
know
the
anguish
of
dreading
lest
you
should
lose
the
only
happiness
that
has
dawned
on
you
on
earth
the
only
thing
that
has
thrown
a
gleam
of
light
in
the
darkness
of
misery
i
understood
yesterday
that
my
life
was
no
more
in
myself
but
in
you
there
is
but
one
woman
in
the
world
for
me
as
there
is
but
one
thought
in
my
soul
i
dare
not
tell
you
to
what
a
state
i
am
reduced
by
my
love
for
you
i
would
have
you
only
as
a
gift
from
yourself
i
must
therefore
avoid
showing
myself
to
you
in
all
the
attractiveness
of
dejection
for
is
it
not
often
more
impressive
to
a
noble
soul
than
that
of
good
fortune
there
are
many
things
i
may
not
tell
you
indeed
i
have
too
lofty
a
notion
of
love
to
taint
it
with
ideas
that
are
alien
to
its
nature
if
my
soul
is
worthy
of
yours
and
my
life
pure
your
heart
will
have
a
sympathetic
insight
and
you
will
understand
me
it
is
the
fate
of
man
to
offer
himself
to
the
woman
who
can
make
him
believe
in
happiness
but
it
is
your
prerogative
to
reject
the
truest
passion
if
it
is
not
in
harmony
with
the
vague
voices
in
your
heart
that
i
know
if
my
lot
as
decided
by
you
must
be
adverse
to
my
hopes
mademoiselle
let
me
appeal
to
the
delicacy
of
your
maiden
soul
and
the
ingenuous
compassion
of
a
woman
to
burn
my
letter
on
my
knees
i
beseech
you
to
forget
all
do
not
mock
at
a
feeling
that
is
wholly
respectful
and
that
is
too
deeply
graven
on
my
heart
ever
to
be
effaced
break
my
heart
but
do
not
rend
it
let
the
expression
of
my
first
love
a
pure
and
youthful
love
be
lost
in
your
pure
and
youthful
heart
let
it
die
there
as
a
prayer
rises
up
to
die
in
the
bosom
of
god
i
owe
you
much
gratitude
i
have
spent
delicious
hours
occupied
in
watching
you
and
giving
myself
up
to
the
faint
dreams
of
my
life
do
not
crush
these
long
but
transient
joys
by
some
girlish
irony
be
satisfied
not
to
answer
me
i
shall
know
how
to
interpret
your
silence
you
will
see
me
no
more
if
i
must
be
condemned
to
know
for
ever
what
happiness
means
and
to
be
for
ever
bereft
of
it
if
like
a
banished
angel
i
am
to
cherish
the
sense
of
celestial
joys
while
bound
for
ever
to
a
world
of
sorrow
well
i
can
keep
the
secret
of
my
love
as
well
as
that
of
my
and
farewell
yes
i
resign
you
to
god
to
whom
i
will
pray
for
you
beseeching
him
to
grant
you
a
happy
life
for
even
if
i
am
driven
from
your
heart
into
which
i
have
crept
by
stealth
still
i
shall
ever
be
near
you
otherwise
of
what
value
would
the
sacred
words
be
of
this
letter
my
first
and
perhaps
my
last
entreaty
if
i
should
ever
cease
to
think
of
you
to
love
you
whether
in
happiness
or
in
woe
should
i
not
deserve
my
punishment
ii
you
are
not
going
away
and
i
am
loved
i
a
poor
insignificant
creature
my
beloved
pauline
you
do
not
yourself
know
the
power
of
the
look
i
believe
in
the
look
you
gave
me
to
tell
me
that
you
had
chosen
me
you
so
young
and
lovely
with
the
world
at
your
feet
to
enable
you
to
understand
my
happiness
i
should
have
to
give
you
a
history
of
my
life
if
you
had
rejected
me
all
was
over
for
me
i
have
suffered
too
much
yes
my
love
for
you
my
comforting
and
stupendous
love
was
a
last
effort
of
yearning
for
the
happiness
my
soul
strove
to
reach
a
soul
crushed
by
fruitless
labor
consumed
by
fears
that
make
me
doubt
myself
eaten
into
by
despair
which
has
often
urged
me
to
die
no
one
in
the
world
can
conceive
of
the
terrors
my
fateful
imagination
inflicts
on
me
it
often
bears
me
up
to
the
sky
and
suddenly
flings
me
to
earth
again
from
prodigious
heights
rushes
of
power
or
some
rare
and
subtle
instance
of
peculiar
lucidity
assure
me
now
and
then
that
i
am
capable
of
great
things
then
i
embrace
the
universe
in
my
mind
i
knead
shape
it
inform
it
i
comprehend
it
or
fancy
that
i
do
then
suddenly
i
awake
alone
sunk
in
blackest
night
helpless
and
weak
i
forget
the
light
i
saw
but
now
i
find
no
succor
above
all
there
is
no
heart
where
i
may
take
refuge
this
distress
of
my
inner
life
affects
my
physical
existence
the
nature
of
my
character
gives
me
over
to
the
raptures
of
happiness
as
defenceless
as
when
the
fearful
light
of
reflection
comes
to
analyze
and
demolish
them
gifted
as
i
am
with
the
melancholy
faculty
of
seeing
obstacles
and
success
with
equal
clearness
according
to
the
mood
of
the
moment
i
am
happy
or
miserable
by
turns
thus
when
i
first
met
you
i
felt
the
presence
of
an
angelic
nature
i
breathed
an
air
that
was
sweet
to
my
burning
breast
i
heard
in
my
soul
the
voice
that
never
can
be
false
telling
me
that
here
was
happiness
but
perceiving
all
the
barriers
that
divided
us
i
understood
the
vastness
of
their
pettiness
and
these
difficulties
terrified
me
more
than
the
prospect
of
happiness
could
delight
me
at
once
i
felt
the
awful
reaction
which
casts
my
expansive
soul
back
on
itself
the
smile
you
had
brought
to
my
lips
suddenly
turned
to
a
bitter
grimace
and
i
could
only
strive
to
keep
calm
while
my
soul
was
boiling
with
the
turmoil
of
contradictory
emotions
in
short
i
experienced
that
gnawing
pang
to
which
years
of
suppressed
sighs
and
betrayed
affections
have
not
inured
me
well
pauline
the
look
by
which
you
promised
that
i
should
be
happy
suddenly
warmed
my
vitality
and
turned
all
my
sorrows
into
joy
now
i
could
wish
that
i
had
suffered
more
my
love
is
suddenly
my
soul
was
a
wide
territory
that
lacked
the
blessing
of
sunshine
and
your
eyes
have
shed
light
on
it
beloved
providence
you
will
be
all
in
all
to
me
orphan
as
i
am
without
a
relation
but
my
uncle
you
will
be
my
whole
family
as
you
are
my
whole
wealth
nay
the
whole
world
to
me
have
you
not
bestowed
on
me
every
gladness
man
can
desire
in
that
chaste
lavish
timid
glance
you
have
given
me
incredible
and
audacity
i
can
dare
all
things
now
i
came
back
to
blois
in
deep
dejection
five
years
of
study
in
the
heart
of
paris
had
made
me
look
on
the
world
as
a
prison
i
had
conceived
of
vast
schemes
and
dared
not
speak
of
them
fame
seemed
to
me
a
prize
for
charlatans
to
which
a
really
noble
spirit
should
not
stoop
thus
my
ideas
could
only
make
their
way
by
the
assistance
of
a
man
bold
enough
to
mount
the
platform
of
the
press
and
to
harangue
loudly
the
simpletons
he
scorns
this
kind
of
courage
i
have
not
i
ploughed
my
way
on
crushed
by
the
verdict
of
the
crowd
in
despair
at
never
making
it
hear
me
i
was
at
once
too
humble
and
too
lofty
i
swallowed
my
thoughts
as
other
men
swallow
humiliations
i
had
even
come
to
despise
knowledge
blaming
it
for
yielding
no
real
happiness
but
since
yesterday
i
am
wholly
changed
for
your
sake
i
now
covet
every
palm
of
glory
every
triumph
of
success
when
i
lay
my
head
on
your
knees
i
could
wish
to
attract
to
you
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
just
as
i
long
to
concentrate
in
my
love
every
idea
every
power
that
is
in
me
the
most
splendid
celebrity
is
a
possession
that
genius
alone
can
create
well
i
can
at
my
will
make
for
you
a
bed
of
laurels
and
if
the
silent
ovation
paid
to
science
is
not
all
you
desire
i
have
within
me
the
sword
of
the
word
i
could
run
in
the
path
of
honor
and
ambition
where
others
only
crawl
command
me
pauline
i
will
be
whatever
you
will
my
iron
will
can
do
anything
i
am
loved
armed
with
that
thought
ought
not
a
man
to
sweep
everything
before
him
the
man
who
wants
all
can
do
all
if
you
are
the
prize
of
success
i
enter
the
lists
to
win
such
a
look
as
that
you
bestowed
on
me
i
would
leap
the
deepest
abyss
through
you
i
understand
the
fabulous
achievements
of
chivalry
and
the
most
fantastic
tales
of
the
i
can
believe
now
in
the
most
fantastic
excesses
of
love
and
in
the
success
of
a
prisoner
wildest
attempt
to
recover
his
liberty
you
have
aroused
the
thousand
virtues
that
lay
dormant
within
me
patience
resignation
all
the
powers
of
my
heart
all
the
strength
of
my
soul
i
live
by
you
and
heavenly
thought
for
you
everything
now
has
a
meaning
for
me
in
life
i
understand
everything
even
the
vanities
of
wealth
i
find
myself
shedding
all
the
pearls
of
the
indies
at
your
feet
i
fancy
you
reclining
either
on
the
rarest
flowers
or
on
the
softest
tissues
and
all
the
splendor
of
the
world
seems
hardly
worthy
of
you
for
whom
i
would
i
could
command
the
harmony
and
the
light
that
are
given
out
by
the
harps
of
seraphs
and
the
stars
of
heaven
alas
a
poor
studious
poet
i
offer
you
in
words
treasures
i
can
not
bestow
i
can
only
give
you
my
heart
in
which
you
reign
for
ever
i
have
nothing
else
but
are
there
no
treasures
in
eternal
gratitude
in
a
smile
whose
expressions
will
perpetually
vary
with
perennial
happiness
under
the
constant
eagerness
of
my
devotion
to
guess
the
wishes
of
your
loving
soul
has
not
one
celestial
glance
given
us
assurance
of
always
understanding
each
other
i
have
a
prayer
now
to
be
said
to
god
every
night
a
prayer
full
of
you
my
pauline
be
happy
and
will
you
fill
all
my
days
as
you
now
fill
my
heart
farewell
i
can
but
trust
you
to
god
alone
iii
pauline
tell
me
if
i
can
in
any
way
have
displeased
you
yesterday
throw
off
the
pride
of
heart
which
inflicts
on
me
the
secret
tortures
that
can
be
caused
by
one
we
love
scold
me
if
you
will
since
yesterday
a
vague
unutterable
dread
of
having
offended
you
pours
grief
on
the
life
of
feeling
which
you
had
made
so
sweet
and
so
rich
the
lightest
veil
that
comes
between
two
souls
sometimes
grows
to
be
a
brazen
wall
there
are
no
venial
crimes
in
love
if
you
have
the
very
spirit
of
that
noble
sentiment
you
must
feel
all
its
pangs
and
we
must
be
unceasingly
careful
not
to
fret
each
other
by
some
heedless
word
no
doubt
my
beloved
treasure
if
there
is
any
fault
it
is
in
me
i
can
not
pride
myself
in
the
belief
that
i
understand
a
woman
heart
in
all
the
expansion
of
its
tenderness
all
the
grace
of
its
devotedness
but
i
will
always
endeavor
to
appreciate
the
value
of
what
you
vouchsafe
to
show
me
of
the
secrets
of
yours
speak
to
me
answer
me
soon
the
melancholy
into
which
we
are
thrown
by
the
idea
of
a
wrong
done
is
frightful
it
casts
a
shroud
over
life
and
doubts
on
everything
i
spent
this
morning
sitting
on
the
bank
by
the
sunken
road
gazing
at
the
turrets
of
villenoix
not
daring
to
go
to
our
hedge
if
you
could
imagine
all
i
saw
in
my
soul
what
gloomy
visions
passed
before
me
under
the
gray
sky
whose
cold
sheen
added
to
my
dreary
mood
i
had
dark
presentiments
i
was
terrified
lest
i
should
fail
to
make
you
happy
i
must
tell
you
everything
my
dear
pauline
there
are
moments
when
the
spirit
of
vitality
seems
to
abandon
me
i
feel
bereft
of
all
strength
everything
is
a
burden
to
me
every
fibre
of
my
body
is
inert
every
sense
is
flaccid
my
sight
grows
dim
my
tongue
is
paralyzed
my
imagination
is
extinct
desire
is
dead
nothing
survives
but
my
mere
human
vitality
at
such
times
though
you
were
in
all
the
splendor
of
your
beauty
though
you
should
lavish
on
me
your
subtlest
smiles
and
tenderest
words
an
evil
influence
would
blind
me
and
distort
the
most
ravishing
melody
into
discordant
sounds
at
those
times
as
i
believe
some
argumentative
demon
stands
before
me
showing
me
the
void
beneath
the
most
real
possessions
this
pitiless
demon
mows
down
every
flower
and
mocks
at
the
sweetest
feelings
saying
and
then
he
mars
the
fairest
work
by
showing
me
its
skeleton
and
reveals
the
mechanism
of
things
while
hiding
the
beautiful
results
at
those
terrible
moments
when
the
evil
spirit
takes
possession
of
me
when
the
divine
light
is
darkened
in
my
soul
without
my
knowing
the
cause
i
sit
in
grief
and
anguish
i
wish
myself
deaf
and
dumb
i
long
for
death
to
give
me
rest
these
hours
of
doubt
and
uneasiness
are
perhaps
inevitable
at
any
rate
they
teach
me
not
to
be
proud
after
the
flights
which
have
borne
me
to
the
skies
where
i
have
gathered
a
full
harvest
of
thoughts
for
it
is
always
after
some
long
excursion
in
the
vast
fields
of
the
intellect
and
after
the
most
luminous
speculations
that
i
tumble
broken
and
weary
into
this
limbo
at
such
a
moment
my
angel
a
wife
would
double
my
love
for
her
at
any
rate
she
might
if
she
were
capricious
ailing
or
depressed
she
would
need
the
comforting
overflow
of
ingenious
affection
and
i
should
not
have
a
glance
to
bestow
on
her
it
is
my
shame
pauline
to
have
to
tell
you
that
at
times
i
could
weep
with
you
but
that
nothing
could
make
me
smile
a
woman
can
always
conceal
her
troubles
for
her
child
or
for
the
man
she
loves
she
can
laugh
in
the
midst
of
suffering
and
could
not
i
for
you
pauline
imitate
the
exquisite
reserve
of
a
woman
since
yesterday
i
have
doubted
my
own
power
if
i
could
displease
you
once
if
i
failed
once
to
understand
you
i
dread
lest
i
should
often
be
carried
out
of
our
happy
circle
by
my
evil
demon
supposing
i
were
to
have
many
of
those
dreadful
moods
or
that
my
unbounded
love
could
not
make
up
for
the
dark
hours
of
my
life
that
i
were
doomed
to
remain
such
as
i
am
fatal
doubts
power
is
indeed
a
fatal
possession
if
what
i
feel
within
me
is
power
pauline
go
leave
me
desert
me
sooner
would
i
endure
every
ill
in
life
than
endure
the
misery
of
knowing
that
you
were
unhappy
through
me
but
perhaps
the
demon
has
had
such
empire
over
me
only
because
i
have
had
no
gentle
white
hands
about
me
to
drive
him
off
no
woman
has
ever
shed
on
me
the
balm
of
her
affection
and
i
know
not
whether
if
love
should
wave
his
pinions
over
my
head
in
these
moments
of
exhaustion
new
strength
might
not
be
given
to
my
spirit
this
terrible
melancholy
is
perhaps
a
result
of
my
isolation
one
of
the
torments
of
a
lonely
soul
which
pays
for
its
hidden
treasures
with
groans
and
unknown
suffering
those
who
enjoy
little
shall
suffer
little
immense
happiness
entails
unutterable
anguish
how
terrible
a
doom
if
it
be
so
must
we
not
shudder
for
ourselves
we
who
are
superhumanly
happy
if
nature
sells
us
everything
at
its
true
value
into
what
pit
are
we
not
fated
to
fall
ah
the
most
fortunate
lovers
are
those
who
die
together
in
the
midst
of
their
youth
and
love
how
sad
it
all
is
does
my
soul
foresee
evil
in
the
future
i
examine
myself
wondering
whether
there
is
anything
in
me
that
can
cause
you
a
moment
anxiety
i
love
you
too
selfishly
perhaps
i
shall
be
laying
on
your
beloved
head
a
burden
heavy
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
joy
my
love
can
bring
to
your
heart
if
there
dwells
in
me
some
inexorable
power
which
i
must
obey
if
i
am
compelled
to
curse
when
you
pray
if
some
dark
thought
coerces
me
when
i
would
fain
kneel
at
your
feet
and
play
as
a
child
will
you
not
be
jealous
of
that
wayward
and
tricky
spirit
you
understand
dearest
heart
that
what
i
dread
is
not
being
wholly
yours
that
i
would
gladly
forego
all
the
sceptres
and
the
palms
of
the
world
to
enshrine
you
in
one
eternal
thought
to
see
a
perfect
life
and
an
exquisite
poem
in
our
rapturous
love
to
throw
my
soul
into
it
drown
my
powers
and
wring
from
each
hour
the
joys
it
has
to
give
ah
my
memories
of
love
are
crowding
back
upon
me
the
clouds
of
despair
will
lift
farewell
i
leave
you
now
to
be
more
entirely
yours
my
beloved
soul
i
look
for
a
line
a
word
that
may
restore
my
peace
of
mind
let
me
know
whether
i
really
grieved
my
pauline
or
whether
some
uncertain
expression
of
her
countenance
misled
me
i
could
not
bear
to
have
to
reproach
myself
after
a
whole
life
of
happiness
for
ever
having
met
you
without
a
smile
of
love
a
honeyed
word
to
grieve
the
woman
i
love
pauline
i
should
count
it
a
crime
tell
me
the
truth
do
not
put
me
off
with
some
magnanimous
subterfuge
but
forgive
me
without
cruelty
fragment
is
so
perfect
an
attachment
happiness
yes
for
years
of
suffering
would
not
pay
for
an
hour
of
love
yesterday
your
sadness
as
i
suppose
passed
into
my
soul
as
swiftly
as
a
shadow
falls
were
you
sad
or
suffering
i
was
wretched
whence
came
my
distress
write
to
me
at
once
why
did
i
not
know
it
we
are
not
yet
completely
one
in
mind
at
two
leagues
distance
or
at
a
thousand
i
ought
to
feel
your
pain
and
sorrows
i
shall
not
believe
that
i
love
you
till
my
life
is
so
bound
up
with
yours
that
our
life
is
one
till
our
hearts
our
thoughts
are
one
i
must
be
where
you
are
see
what
you
feel
feel
what
you
feel
be
with
you
in
thought
did
not
i
know
at
once
that
your
carriage
had
been
overthrown
and
you
were
bruised
but
on
that
day
i
had
been
with
you
i
had
never
left
you
i
could
see
you
when
my
uncle
asked
me
what
made
me
turn
so
pale
i
answered
at
once
de
villenoix
had
has
a
fall
why
then
yesterday
did
i
fail
to
read
your
soul
did
you
wish
to
hide
the
cause
of
your
grief
however
i
fancied
i
could
feel
that
you
were
arguing
in
my
favor
though
in
vain
with
that
dreadful
salomon
who
freezes
my
blood
that
man
is
not
of
our
heaven
why
do
you
insist
that
our
happiness
which
has
no
resemblance
to
that
of
other
people
should
conform
to
the
laws
of
the
world
and
yet
i
delight
too
much
in
your
bashfulness
your
religion
your
superstitions
not
to
obey
your
lightest
whim
what
you
do
must
be
right
nothing
can
be
purer
than
your
mind
as
nothing
is
lovelier
than
your
face
which
reflects
your
divine
soul
i
shall
wait
for
a
letter
before
going
along
the
lanes
to
meet
the
sweet
hour
you
grant
me
oh
if
you
could
know
how
the
sight
of
those
turrets
makes
my
heart
throb
when
i
see
them
edged
with
light
by
the
moon
our
only
confidante
iv
farewell
to
glory
farewell
to
the
future
to
the
life
i
had
dreamed
of
now
my
my
glory
is
that
i
am
yours
and
worthy
of
you
my
future
lies
entirely
in
the
hope
of
seeing
you
and
is
not
my
life
summed
up
in
sitting
at
your
feet
in
lying
under
your
eyes
in
drawing
deep
breaths
in
the
heaven
you
have
created
for
me
all
my
powers
all
my
thoughts
must
be
yours
since
you
could
speak
those
thrilling
words
sufferings
must
be
mine
should
i
not
be
stealing
some
joys
from
love
some
moments
from
happiness
some
experiences
from
your
divine
spirit
if
i
gave
my
hours
to
study
ideas
to
the
world
and
poems
to
the
poets
nay
nay
my
very
life
i
will
treasure
everything
for
you
i
will
bring
to
you
every
flower
of
my
soul
is
there
anything
fine
enough
splendid
enough
in
all
the
resources
of
the
world
or
of
intellect
to
do
honor
to
a
heart
so
rich
so
pure
as
yours
the
heart
to
which
i
dare
now
and
again
to
unite
my
own
yes
now
and
again
i
dare
believe
that
i
can
love
as
much
as
you
do
and
yet
no
you
are
the
there
will
always
be
a
greater
charm
in
the
expression
of
your
feelings
more
harmony
in
your
voice
more
grace
in
your
smile
more
purity
in
your
looks
than
in
mine
let
me
feel
that
you
are
the
creature
of
a
higher
sphere
than
that
i
live
in
it
will
be
your
pride
to
have
descended
from
it
mine
that
i
should
have
deserved
you
and
you
will
not
perhaps
have
fallen
too
far
by
coming
down
to
me
in
my
poverty
and
misery
nay
if
a
woman
most
glorious
refuge
is
in
a
heart
that
is
wholly
her
own
you
will
always
reign
supreme
in
mine
not
a
thought
not
a
deed
shall
ever
pollute
this
heart
this
glorious
sanctuary
so
long
as
you
vouchsafe
to
dwell
in
it
and
will
you
not
dwell
in
it
for
ever
did
you
not
enchant
me
by
the
words
and
for
ever
et
and
i
have
written
these
words
of
our
ritual
below
your
portrait
words
worthy
of
you
as
they
are
of
god
he
is
et
as
my
love
is
never
no
never
can
i
exhaust
that
which
is
immense
infinite
unbounded
and
such
is
the
feeling
i
have
for
you
i
have
imagined
its
immeasurable
extent
as
we
measure
space
by
the
dimensions
of
one
of
its
parts
i
have
had
ineffable
joys
whole
hours
filled
with
delicious
meditation
as
i
have
recalled
a
single
gesture
or
the
tone
of
a
word
of
yours
thus
there
will
be
memories
of
which
the
magnitude
will
overpower
me
if
the
reminiscence
of
a
sweet
and
friendly
interview
is
enough
to
make
me
shed
tears
of
joy
to
move
and
thrill
my
soul
and
to
be
an
inexhaustible
wellspring
of
gladness
love
is
the
life
of
angels
i
can
never
i
believe
exhaust
my
joy
in
seeing
you
this
rapture
the
least
fervid
of
any
though
it
never
can
last
long
enough
has
made
me
apprehend
the
eternal
contemplation
in
which
seraphs
and
spirits
abide
in
the
presence
of
god
nothing
can
be
more
natural
if
from
his
essence
there
emanates
a
light
as
fruitful
of
new
emotions
as
that
of
your
eyes
is
of
your
imposing
brow
and
your
beautiful
countenance
the
image
of
your
soul
then
the
soul
our
second
self
whose
pure
form
can
never
perish
makes
our
love
immortal
i
would
there
were
some
other
language
than
that
i
use
to
express
to
you
the
ecstasy
of
my
love
but
since
there
is
one
of
our
own
creating
since
our
looks
are
living
speech
must
we
not
meet
face
to
face
to
read
in
each
other
eyes
those
questions
and
answers
from
the
heart
that
are
so
living
so
penetrating
that
one
evening
you
could
say
to
me
silent
when
i
was
not
speaking
do
you
remember
it
dear
life
when
i
am
away
from
you
in
the
darkness
of
absence
am
i
not
reduced
to
use
human
words
too
feeble
to
express
heavenly
feelings
but
words
at
any
rate
represent
the
marks
these
feelings
leave
in
my
soul
just
as
the
word
imperfectly
sums
up
the
notions
we
form
of
that
mysterious
first
cause
but
in
spite
of
the
subtleties
and
infinite
variety
of
language
i
have
no
words
that
can
express
to
you
the
exquisite
union
by
which
my
life
is
merged
into
yours
whenever
i
think
of
you
and
with
what
word
can
i
conclude
when
i
cease
writing
to
you
and
yet
do
not
part
from
you
what
can
mean
unless
in
death
but
is
death
a
farewell
would
not
my
spirit
be
then
more
closely
one
with
yours
ah
my
first
and
last
thought
formerly
i
offered
you
my
heart
and
life
on
my
knees
now
what
fresh
blossoms
of
feelings
can
i
discover
in
my
soul
that
i
have
not
already
given
you
it
would
be
a
gift
of
a
part
of
what
is
wholly
yours
are
you
my
future
how
deeply
i
regret
the
past
i
would
i
could
have
back
all
the
years
that
are
ours
no
more
and
give
them
to
you
to
reign
over
as
you
do
over
my
present
life
what
indeed
was
that
time
when
i
knew
you
not
it
would
be
a
void
but
that
i
was
so
wretched
fragment
beloved
angel
how
delightful
last
evening
was
how
full
of
riches
your
dear
heart
is
and
is
your
love
endless
like
mine
each
word
brought
me
fresh
joy
and
each
look
made
it
deeper
the
placid
expression
of
your
countenance
gave
our
thoughts
a
limitless
horizon
it
was
all
as
infinite
as
the
sky
and
as
bland
as
its
blue
the
refinement
of
your
adored
features
repeated
itself
by
some
inexplicable
magic
in
your
pretty
movements
and
your
least
gestures
i
knew
that
you
were
all
graciousness
all
love
but
i
did
not
know
how
variously
graceful
you
could
be
everything
combined
to
urge
me
to
tender
solicitation
to
make
me
ask
the
first
kiss
that
a
woman
always
refuses
no
doubt
that
it
may
be
snatched
from
her
you
dear
soul
of
my
life
will
never
guess
beforehand
what
you
may
grant
to
my
love
and
will
yield
perhaps
without
knowing
it
you
are
utterly
true
and
obey
your
heart
alone
the
sweet
tones
of
your
voice
blended
with
the
tender
harmonies
that
filled
the
quiet
air
the
cloudless
sky
not
a
bird
piped
not
a
breeze
whispered
solitude
you
and
i
the
motionless
leaves
did
not
quiver
in
the
beautiful
sunset
hues
which
are
both
light
and
shadow
you
felt
that
heavenly
poetry
you
who
experienced
so
many
various
emotions
and
who
so
often
raised
your
eyes
to
heaven
to
avoid
answering
me
you
who
are
proud
and
saucy
humble
and
masterful
who
give
yourself
to
me
so
completely
in
spirit
and
in
thought
and
evade
the
most
bashful
caress
dear
witcheries
of
the
heart
they
ring
in
my
ears
they
sound
and
play
there
still
sweet
words
but
half
spoken
like
a
child
speech
neither
promise
nor
confession
but
allowing
love
to
cherish
its
fairest
hopes
without
fear
or
torment
how
pure
a
memory
for
life
what
a
free
blossoming
of
all
the
flowers
that
spring
from
the
soul
which
a
mere
trifle
can
blight
but
which
at
that
moment
everything
warmed
and
expanded
and
it
will
always
be
so
will
it
not
my
beloved
as
i
recall
this
morning
the
fresh
and
living
delights
revealed
to
me
in
that
hour
i
am
conscious
of
a
joy
which
makes
me
conceive
of
true
love
as
an
ocean
of
everlasting
and
experiences
into
which
we
may
plunge
with
increasing
delight
every
day
every
word
every
kiss
every
glance
must
increase
it
by
its
tribute
of
past
happiness
hearts
that
are
large
enough
never
to
forget
must
live
every
moment
in
their
past
joys
as
much
as
in
those
promised
by
the
future
this
was
my
dream
of
old
and
now
it
is
no
longer
a
dream
have
i
not
met
on
this
earth
with
an
angel
who
had
made
me
know
all
its
happiness
as
a
reward
perhaps
for
having
endured
all
its
torments
angel
of
heaven
i
salute
thee
with
a
kiss
i
shall
send
you
this
hymn
of
thanksgiving
from
my
heart
i
owe
it
to
you
but
it
can
hardly
express
my
gratitude
or
the
morning
worship
my
heart
offers
up
day
by
day
to
her
who
epitomized
the
whole
gospel
of
the
heart
in
this
divine
word
v
what
no
further
difficulties
dearest
heart
we
shall
be
free
to
belong
to
each
other
every
day
every
hour
every
minute
and
for
ever
we
may
be
as
happy
for
all
the
days
of
our
life
as
we
now
are
by
stealth
at
rare
intervals
our
pure
deep
feelings
will
assume
the
expression
of
the
thousand
fond
acts
i
have
dreamed
of
for
me
your
little
foot
will
be
bared
you
will
be
wholly
mine
such
happiness
kills
me
it
is
too
much
for
me
my
head
is
too
weak
it
will
burst
with
the
vehemence
of
my
ideas
i
cry
and
i
laugh
i
am
possessed
every
joy
is
an
arrow
of
flame
it
pierces
and
burns
me
in
fancy
you
rise
before
my
eyes
ravished
and
dazzled
by
numberless
and
capricious
images
of
delight
in
short
our
whole
future
life
is
before
me
its
torrents
its
still
places
its
joys
it
seethes
it
flows
on
it
lies
sleeping
then
again
it
awakes
fresh
and
young
i
see
myself
and
you
side
by
side
walking
with
equal
pace
living
in
the
same
thought
each
dwelling
in
each
other
heart
understanding
each
other
responding
to
each
other
as
an
echo
catches
and
repeats
a
sound
across
wide
distances
can
life
be
long
when
it
is
thus
consumed
hour
by
hour
shall
we
not
die
in
a
first
embrace
what
if
our
souls
have
already
met
in
that
sweet
evening
kiss
which
almost
overpowered
us
a
feeling
kiss
but
the
crown
of
my
hopes
the
ineffectual
expression
of
all
the
prayers
i
breathe
while
we
are
apart
hidden
in
my
soul
like
remorse
i
who
would
creep
back
and
hide
in
the
hedge
only
to
hear
your
footsteps
as
you
went
homewards
i
may
henceforth
admire
you
at
my
leisure
see
you
busy
moving
smiling
prattling
an
endless
joy
you
can
not
imagine
all
the
gladness
it
is
to
me
to
see
you
going
and
coming
only
a
man
can
know
that
deep
delight
your
least
movement
gives
me
greater
pleasure
than
a
mother
even
can
feel
as
she
sees
her
child
asleep
or
at
play
i
love
you
with
every
kind
of
love
in
one
the
grace
of
your
least
gesture
is
always
new
to
me
i
fancy
i
could
spend
whole
nights
breathing
your
breath
i
would
i
could
steal
into
every
detail
of
your
life
be
the
very
substance
of
your
thoughts
be
your
very
self
well
we
shall
at
any
rate
never
part
again
no
human
alloy
shall
ever
disturb
our
love
infinite
in
its
phases
and
as
pure
as
all
things
are
which
are
one
our
love
vast
as
the
sea
vast
as
the
sky
you
are
mine
all
mine
i
may
look
into
the
depths
of
your
eyes
to
read
the
sweet
soul
that
alternately
hides
and
shines
there
to
anticipate
your
wishes
my
listen
to
some
things
i
have
never
yet
dared
to
tell
you
but
which
i
may
confess
to
you
now
i
felt
a
certain
bashfulness
of
soul
which
hindered
the
full
expression
of
my
feelings
so
i
strove
to
shroud
them
under
the
garbs
of
thoughts
but
now
i
long
to
lay
my
heart
bare
before
you
to
tell
you
of
the
ardor
of
my
dreams
to
reveal
the
boiling
demands
of
my
senses
excited
no
doubt
by
the
solitude
in
which
i
have
lived
perpetually
fired
by
conceptions
of
happiness
and
aroused
by
you
so
fair
in
form
so
attractive
in
manner
how
can
i
express
to
you
my
thirst
for
the
unknown
rapture
of
possessing
an
adored
wife
a
rapture
to
which
the
union
of
two
souls
by
love
must
give
frenzied
intensity
yes
my
pauline
i
have
sat
for
hours
in
a
sort
of
stupor
caused
by
the
violence
of
my
passionate
yearning
lost
in
the
dream
of
a
caress
as
though
in
a
bottomless
abyss
at
such
moments
my
whole
vitality
my
thoughts
and
powers
are
merged
and
united
in
what
i
must
call
desire
for
lack
of
a
word
to
express
that
nameless
delirium
and
i
may
confess
to
you
now
that
one
day
when
i
would
not
take
your
hand
when
you
offered
it
so
sweetly
an
act
of
melancholy
prudence
that
made
you
doubt
my
love
i
was
in
one
of
those
fits
of
madness
when
a
man
could
commit
a
murder
to
possess
a
woman
yes
if
i
had
felt
the
exquisite
pressure
you
offered
me
as
vividly
as
i
heard
your
voice
in
my
heart
i
know
not
to
what
lengths
my
passion
might
not
have
carried
me
but
i
can
be
silent
and
suffer
a
great
deal
why
speak
of
this
anguish
when
my
visions
are
to
become
realities
it
will
be
in
my
power
now
to
make
life
one
long
dearest
love
there
is
a
certain
effect
of
light
on
your
black
hair
which
could
rivet
me
for
hours
my
eyes
full
of
tears
as
i
gazed
at
your
sweet
person
were
it
not
that
you
turn
away
and
say
shame
you
make
me
quite
shy
then
our
love
is
to
be
made
known
oh
pauline
the
eyes
of
others
the
curiosity
of
strangers
weigh
on
my
soul
let
us
go
to
villenoix
and
stay
there
far
from
every
one
i
should
like
no
creature
in
human
form
to
intrude
into
the
sanctuary
where
you
are
to
be
mine
i
could
even
wish
that
when
we
are
dead
it
should
cease
to
exist
should
be
destroyed
yes
i
would
fain
hide
from
all
nature
a
happiness
which
we
alone
can
understand
alone
can
feel
which
is
so
stupendous
that
i
throw
myself
into
it
only
to
die
it
is
a
gulf
do
not
be
alarmed
by
the
tears
that
have
wetted
this
page
they
are
tears
of
joy
my
only
blessing
we
need
never
part
again
in
i
traveled
from
paris
to
touraine
by
at
mer
we
took
up
a
passenger
for
blois
as
the
guard
put
him
into
that
part
of
the
coach
where
i
had
my
seat
he
said
jestingly
you
will
not
be
crowded
monsieur
lefebvre
i
was
in
fact
alone
on
hearing
this
name
and
seeing
a
old
man
who
looked
eighty
at
least
i
naturally
thought
of
lambert
uncle
after
a
few
ingenious
questions
i
discovered
that
i
was
not
mistaken
the
good
man
had
been
looking
after
his
vintage
at
mer
and
was
returning
to
blois
i
then
asked
for
some
news
of
my
old
chum
at
the
first
word
the
old
priest
face
as
grave
and
stern
already
as
that
of
a
soldier
who
has
gone
through
many
hardships
became
more
sad
and
dark
the
lines
on
his
forehead
were
slightly
knit
he
set
his
lips
and
said
with
a
suspicious
glance
then
you
have
never
seen
him
since
you
left
the
college
indeed
i
have
not
said
i
but
we
are
equally
to
blame
for
our
forgetfulness
young
men
as
you
know
lead
such
an
adventurous
and
life
when
they
leave
their
that
it
is
only
by
meeting
that
they
can
be
sure
of
an
enduring
affection
however
a
reminiscence
of
youth
sometimes
comes
as
a
reminder
and
it
is
impossible
to
forget
entirely
especially
when
two
lads
have
been
such
friends
as
we
were
we
went
by
the
name
of
the
i
told
him
my
name
when
he
heard
it
the
worthy
man
grew
gloomier
than
ever
then
you
have
not
heard
his
story
said
he
my
poor
nephew
was
to
be
married
to
the
richest
heiress
in
blois
but
the
day
before
his
wedding
he
went
mad
lambert
mad
cried
i
in
dismay
but
from
what
cause
he
had
the
finest
memory
the
most
brain
the
soundest
judgment
i
ever
met
with
really
a
great
genius
with
too
great
a
passion
for
mysticism
perhaps
but
the
kindest
heart
in
the
world
something
most
extraordinary
must
have
happened
i
see
you
knew
him
well
said
the
priest
from
mer
till
we
reached
blois
we
talked
only
of
my
poor
friend
with
long
digressions
by
which
i
learned
the
facts
i
have
already
related
in
the
order
of
their
interest
i
confessed
to
his
uncle
the
character
of
our
studies
and
of
his
nephew
predominant
ideas
then
the
old
man
told
me
of
the
events
that
had
come
into
lambert
life
since
our
parting
from
monsieur
lefebvre
account
lambert
had
betrayed
some
symptoms
of
madness
before
his
marriage
but
they
were
such
as
are
common
to
men
who
love
passionately
and
seemed
to
me
less
startling
when
i
knew
how
vehement
his
love
had
been
and
when
i
saw
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
in
the
country
where
ideas
are
scarce
a
man
overflowing
with
original
thought
and
devoted
to
a
system
as
louis
was
might
well
be
regarded
as
eccentric
to
say
the
least
his
language
would
no
doubt
seem
the
stranger
because
he
so
rarely
spoke
he
would
say
that
man
does
not
dwell
in
heaven
where
any
one
else
would
have
said
we
are
not
made
on
the
same
pattern
every
clever
man
has
his
own
quirks
of
speech
the
broader
his
genius
the
more
conspicuous
are
the
singularities
which
constitute
the
various
degrees
of
eccentricity
in
the
country
an
eccentric
man
is
at
once
set
down
as
half
mad
hence
monsieur
lefebvre
first
sentences
left
me
doubtful
of
my
schoolmate
insanity
i
listened
to
the
old
man
but
i
criticised
his
statements
the
most
serious
symptom
had
supervened
a
day
or
two
before
the
marriage
louis
had
had
some
attacks
of
catalepsy
he
had
once
remained
motionless
for
hours
his
eyes
staring
neither
speaking
nor
eating
a
purely
nervous
affection
to
which
persons
under
the
influence
of
violent
passion
are
liable
a
rare
malady
but
perfectly
well
known
to
the
medical
faculty
what
was
really
extraordinary
was
that
louis
should
not
have
had
several
previous
attacks
since
his
habits
of
rapt
thought
and
the
character
of
his
mind
would
predispose
him
to
them
but
his
temperament
physical
and
mental
was
so
admirably
balanced
that
it
had
no
doubt
been
able
to
resist
the
demands
on
his
strength
the
excitement
to
which
he
had
been
wound
up
by
the
anticipation
of
acute
physical
enjoyment
enhanced
by
a
chaste
life
and
a
soul
had
no
doubt
led
to
these
attacks
of
which
the
results
are
as
little
known
as
the
cause
the
letters
that
have
by
chance
escaped
destruction
show
very
plainly
a
transition
from
pure
idealism
to
the
most
intense
sensualism
time
was
when
lambert
and
i
had
admired
this
phenomenon
of
the
human
mind
in
which
he
saw
the
fortuitous
separation
of
our
two
natures
and
the
signs
of
a
total
removal
of
the
inner
man
using
its
unknown
faculties
under
the
operation
of
an
unknown
cause
this
disorder
a
mystery
as
deep
as
that
of
sleep
was
connected
with
the
scheme
of
evidence
which
lambert
had
set
forth
in
his
on
the
and
when
monsieur
lefebvre
spoke
to
me
of
louis
first
attack
i
suddenly
remembered
a
conversation
we
had
had
on
the
subject
after
reading
a
medical
book
deep
meditation
and
rapt
ecstasy
are
perhaps
the
undeveloped
germs
of
catalepsy
he
said
in
conclusion
on
the
occasion
when
he
so
concisely
formulated
this
idea
he
had
been
trying
to
link
mental
phenomena
together
by
a
series
of
results
following
the
processes
of
the
intellect
step
by
step
from
their
beginnings
as
those
simple
purely
animal
impulses
of
instinct
which
are
to
many
human
beings
particularly
to
those
men
whose
energies
are
wholly
spent
in
mere
mechanical
labor
then
going
on
to
the
aggregation
of
ideas
and
rising
to
comparison
reflection
meditation
and
finally
ecstasy
and
catalepsy
lambert
of
course
in
the
artlessness
of
youth
imagined
that
he
had
laid
down
the
lines
of
a
great
work
when
he
thus
built
up
a
scale
of
the
various
degrees
of
mental
powers
i
remember
that
by
one
of
those
chances
which
seems
like
predestination
we
got
hold
of
a
great
martyrology
in
which
the
most
curious
narratives
are
given
of
the
total
abeyance
of
physical
life
which
a
man
can
attain
to
under
the
paroxysms
of
the
inner
life
by
reflecting
on
the
effects
of
fanaticism
lambert
was
led
to
believe
that
the
collected
ideas
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
feelings
may
very
possibly
be
the
material
outcome
of
some
fluid
which
is
generated
in
all
men
more
or
less
abundantly
according
to
the
way
in
which
their
organs
absorb
from
the
medium
in
which
they
live
the
elementary
atoms
that
produce
it
we
went
crazy
over
catalepsy
and
with
the
eagerness
that
boys
throw
into
every
pursuit
we
endeavored
to
endure
pain
by
thinking
of
something
else
we
exhausted
ourselves
by
making
experiments
not
unlike
those
of
the
epileptic
fanatics
of
the
last
century
a
religious
mania
which
will
some
day
be
of
service
to
the
science
of
humanity
i
would
stand
on
lambert
chest
remaining
there
for
several
minutes
without
giving
him
the
slightest
pain
but
notwithstanding
these
crazy
attempts
we
did
not
achieve
an
attack
of
catalepsy
this
digression
seemed
necessary
to
account
for
my
first
doubts
which
were
however
completely
dispelled
by
monsieur
lefebvre
when
this
attack
had
passed
off
said
he
my
nephew
sank
into
a
state
of
extreme
terror
a
dejection
that
nothing
could
overcome
he
thought
himself
unfit
for
marriage
i
watched
him
with
the
care
of
a
mother
for
her
child
and
found
him
preparing
to
perform
on
himself
the
operation
to
which
origen
believed
he
owed
his
talents
i
at
once
carried
him
off
to
paris
and
placed
him
under
the
care
of
monsieur
esquirol
all
through
our
journey
louis
sat
sunk
in
almost
unbroken
torpor
and
did
not
recognize
me
the
paris
physicians
pronounced
him
incurable
and
unanimously
advised
his
being
left
in
perfect
solitude
with
nothing
to
break
the
silence
that
was
needful
for
his
very
improbable
recovery
and
that
he
should
live
always
in
a
cool
room
with
a
subdued
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
whom
i
had
been
careful
not
to
apprise
of
louis
state
he
went
on
blinking
his
eyes
but
who
was
supposed
to
have
broken
off
the
match
went
to
paris
and
heard
what
the
doctors
had
pronounced
she
immediately
begged
to
see
my
nephew
who
hardly
recognized
her
then
like
the
noble
soul
she
is
she
insisted
on
devoting
herself
to
giving
him
such
care
as
might
tend
to
his
recovery
she
would
have
been
obliged
to
do
so
if
he
had
been
her
husband
she
said
and
could
she
do
less
for
him
as
her
lover
she
removed
louis
to
villenoix
where
they
have
been
living
for
two
years
so
instead
of
continuing
my
journey
i
stopped
at
blois
to
go
to
see
louis
good
monsieur
lefebvre
would
not
hear
of
my
lodging
anywhere
but
at
his
house
where
he
showed
me
his
nephew
room
with
the
books
and
all
else
that
had
belonged
to
him
at
every
turn
the
old
man
could
not
suppress
some
mournful
exclamation
showing
what
hopes
louis
precocious
genius
had
raised
and
the
terrible
grief
into
which
this
irreparable
ruin
had
plunged
him
that
young
fellow
knew
everything
my
dear
sir
said
he
laying
on
the
table
a
volume
containing
spinoza
works
how
could
so
well
organized
a
brain
go
astray
indeed
monsieur
said
i
was
it
not
perhaps
the
result
of
its
being
so
highly
organized
if
he
really
is
a
victim
to
the
malady
as
yet
unstudied
in
all
its
aspects
which
is
known
simply
as
madness
i
am
inclined
to
attribute
it
to
his
passion
his
studies
and
his
mode
of
life
had
strung
his
powers
and
faculties
to
a
degree
of
energy
beyond
which
the
least
further
strain
was
too
much
for
nature
love
was
enough
to
crack
them
or
to
raise
them
to
a
new
form
of
expression
which
we
are
maligning
perhaps
by
ticketing
it
without
due
knowledge
in
fact
he
may
perhaps
have
regarded
the
joys
of
marriage
as
an
obstacle
to
the
perfection
of
his
inner
man
and
his
flight
towards
spiritual
spheres
my
dear
sir
said
the
old
man
after
listening
to
me
with
attention
your
reasoning
is
no
doubt
very
sound
but
even
if
i
could
follow
it
would
this
melancholy
logic
comfort
me
for
the
loss
of
my
nephew
lambert
uncle
was
one
of
those
men
who
live
only
by
their
affections
i
went
to
villenoix
on
the
following
day
the
kind
old
man
accompanied
me
to
the
gates
of
blois
when
we
were
out
on
the
road
to
villenoix
he
stopped
me
and
said
as
you
may
suppose
i
do
not
go
there
but
do
not
forget
what
i
have
said
and
in
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
presence
affect
not
to
perceive
that
louis
is
mad
he
remained
standing
on
the
spot
where
i
left
him
watching
me
till
i
was
out
of
sight
i
made
my
way
to
the
chateau
of
villenoix
not
without
deep
agitation
my
thoughts
were
many
at
each
step
on
this
road
which
louis
had
so
often
trodden
with
a
heart
full
of
hopes
a
soul
spurred
on
by
the
myriad
darts
of
love
the
shrubs
the
trees
the
turns
of
the
winding
road
where
little
gullies
broke
the
banks
on
each
side
were
to
me
full
of
strange
interest
i
tried
to
enter
into
the
impressions
and
thoughts
of
my
unhappy
friend
those
evening
meetings
on
the
edge
of
the
coombe
where
his
had
been
wont
to
find
him
had
no
doubt
initiated
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
into
the
secrets
of
that
vast
and
lofty
spirit
as
i
had
learned
them
all
some
years
before
but
the
thing
that
most
occupied
my
mind
and
gave
to
my
pilgrimage
the
interest
of
intense
curiosity
in
addition
to
the
almost
pious
feelings
that
led
me
onwards
was
that
glorious
faith
of
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
which
the
good
priest
had
told
me
of
had
she
in
the
course
of
time
been
infected
with
her
lover
madness
or
had
she
so
completely
entered
into
his
soul
that
she
could
understand
all
its
thoughts
even
the
most
perplexed
i
lost
myself
in
the
wonderful
problem
of
feeling
passing
the
highest
inspirations
of
passion
and
the
most
beautiful
instances
of
that
one
should
die
for
the
other
is
an
almost
vulgar
form
of
devotion
to
live
faithful
to
one
love
is
a
form
of
heroism
that
immortalized
mademoiselle
dupuis
when
the
great
napoleon
and
lord
byron
could
find
successors
in
the
hearts
of
women
they
had
loved
we
may
well
admire
bolingbroke
widow
but
mademoiselle
dupuis
could
feed
on
the
memories
of
many
years
of
happiness
whereas
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
having
known
nothing
of
love
but
its
first
excitement
seemed
to
me
to
typify
love
in
its
highest
expression
if
she
were
herself
almost
crazy
it
was
splendid
but
if
she
had
understood
and
entered
into
his
madness
she
combined
with
the
beauty
of
a
noble
heart
a
crowning
effort
of
passion
worthy
to
be
studied
and
honored
when
i
saw
the
tall
turrets
of
the
chateau
remembering
how
often
poor
lambert
must
have
thrilled
at
the
sight
of
them
my
heart
beat
anxiously
as
i
recalled
the
events
of
our
boyhood
i
was
almost
a
sharer
in
his
present
life
and
situation
at
last
i
reached
a
wide
deserted
courtyard
and
i
went
into
the
hall
of
the
house
without
meeting
a
soul
there
the
sound
of
my
steps
brought
out
an
old
woman
to
whom
i
gave
a
letter
written
to
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
by
monsieur
lefebvre
in
a
few
minutes
this
woman
returned
to
bid
me
enter
and
led
me
to
a
low
room
floored
with
marble
the
venetian
shutters
were
closed
and
at
the
end
of
the
room
i
dimly
saw
louis
lambert
be
seated
monsieur
said
a
gentle
voice
that
went
to
my
heart
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
was
at
my
side
before
i
was
aware
of
her
presence
and
noiselessly
brought
me
a
chair
which
at
first
i
would
not
accept
it
was
so
dark
that
at
first
i
saw
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
and
lambert
only
as
two
black
masses
perceived
against
the
gloomy
background
i
presently
sat
down
under
the
influence
of
the
feeling
that
comes
over
us
almost
in
spite
of
ourselves
under
the
obscure
vault
of
a
church
my
eyes
full
of
the
bright
sunshine
accustomed
themselves
gradually
to
this
artificial
night
monsieur
is
your
old
she
said
to
louis
he
made
no
reply
at
last
i
could
see
him
and
it
was
one
of
those
spectacles
that
are
stamped
on
the
memory
for
ever
he
was
standing
his
elbows
resting
on
the
cornice
of
the
low
wainscot
which
threw
his
body
forward
so
that
it
seemed
bowed
under
the
weight
of
his
bent
head
his
hair
was
as
long
as
a
woman
falling
over
his
shoulders
and
hanging
about
his
face
giving
him
a
resemblance
to
the
busts
of
the
great
men
of
the
time
of
louis
xiv
his
face
was
perfectly
white
he
constantly
rubbed
one
leg
against
the
other
with
a
mechanical
action
that
nothing
could
have
checked
and
the
incessant
friction
of
the
bones
made
a
doleful
sound
near
him
was
a
bed
of
moss
on
boards
he
very
rarely
lies
down
said
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
but
whenever
he
does
he
sleeps
for
several
days
louis
stood
as
i
beheld
him
day
and
night
with
a
fixed
gaze
never
winking
his
eyelids
as
we
do
having
asked
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
whether
a
little
more
light
would
hurt
our
friend
on
her
reply
i
opened
the
shutters
a
little
way
and
could
see
the
expression
of
countenance
alas
he
was
wrinkled
his
eyes
dull
and
lifeless
as
those
of
the
blind
his
features
seemed
all
drawn
upwards
to
the
top
of
his
head
i
made
several
attempts
to
talk
to
him
but
he
did
not
hear
me
he
was
a
wreck
snatched
from
the
grave
a
conquest
of
life
from
death
or
of
death
from
life
i
stayed
for
about
an
hour
sunk
in
unaccountable
dreams
and
lost
in
painful
thought
i
listened
to
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
who
told
me
every
detail
of
this
life
that
of
a
child
in
arms
suddenly
louis
ceased
rubbing
his
legs
together
and
said
slowly
the
angels
are
white
i
can
not
express
the
effect
produced
upon
me
by
this
utterance
by
the
sound
of
the
voice
i
had
loved
whose
accents
so
painfully
expected
had
seemed
to
be
lost
for
ever
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
in
spite
of
every
effort
an
involuntary
instinct
warned
me
making
me
doubt
whether
louis
had
really
lost
his
reason
i
was
indeed
well
assured
that
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
me
but
the
sweetness
of
his
tone
which
seemed
to
reveal
heavenly
happiness
gave
his
speech
an
amazing
effect
these
words
the
incomplete
revelation
of
an
unknown
world
rang
in
our
souls
like
some
glorious
distant
bells
in
the
depth
of
a
dark
night
i
was
no
longer
surprised
that
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
considered
lambert
to
be
perfectly
sane
the
life
of
the
soul
had
perhaps
subdued
that
of
the
body
his
faithful
companion
had
no
doubt
as
i
had
at
that
moment
intuitions
of
that
melodious
and
beautiful
existence
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
heaven
in
its
highest
meaning
this
woman
this
angel
always
was
with
him
seated
at
her
embroidery
frame
and
each
time
she
drew
the
needle
out
she
gazed
at
lambert
with
sad
and
tender
feeling
unable
to
endure
this
terrible
sight
for
i
could
not
like
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
read
all
his
secrets
i
went
out
and
she
came
with
me
to
walk
for
a
few
minutes
and
talk
of
herself
and
of
lambert
louis
must
no
doubt
appear
to
be
mad
said
she
but
he
is
not
if
the
term
mad
ought
only
to
be
used
in
speaking
of
those
whose
brain
is
for
some
unknown
cause
diseased
and
who
can
show
no
reason
in
their
actions
everything
in
my
husband
is
perfectly
balanced
though
he
did
not
actively
recognize
you
it
is
not
that
he
did
not
see
you
he
has
succeeded
in
detaching
himself
from
his
body
and
discerns
us
under
some
other
aspect
what
that
is
i
know
not
when
he
speaks
he
utters
wondrous
things
only
it
often
happens
that
he
concludes
in
speech
an
idea
that
had
its
beginning
in
his
mind
or
he
may
begin
a
sentence
and
finish
it
in
thought
to
other
men
he
seems
insane
to
me
living
as
i
do
in
his
mind
his
ideas
are
quite
lucid
i
follow
the
road
his
spirit
travels
and
though
i
do
not
know
every
turning
i
can
reach
the
goal
with
him
which
of
us
has
not
often
known
what
it
is
to
think
of
some
futile
thing
and
be
led
on
to
some
serious
reflection
through
the
ideas
or
memories
it
brings
in
its
train
not
unfrequently
after
speaking
about
some
trifle
the
simple
of
a
rapid
train
of
reflections
a
thinker
may
forget
or
be
silent
as
to
the
abstract
connection
of
ideas
leading
to
his
conclusion
and
speak
again
only
to
utter
the
last
link
in
the
chain
of
his
meditations
inferior
minds
to
whom
this
swift
mental
vision
is
a
thing
unknown
who
are
ignorant
of
the
spirit
inner
workings
laugh
at
the
dreamer
and
if
he
is
subject
to
this
kind
of
obliviousness
regard
him
as
a
madman
louis
is
always
in
this
state
he
soars
perpetually
through
the
spaces
of
thought
traversing
them
with
the
swiftness
of
a
swallow
i
can
follow
him
in
his
flight
this
is
the
whole
history
of
his
madness
some
day
perhaps
louis
will
come
back
to
the
life
in
which
we
vegetate
but
if
he
breathes
the
air
of
heaven
before
the
time
when
we
may
be
permitted
to
do
so
why
should
we
desire
to
have
him
down
among
us
i
am
content
to
hear
his
heart
beat
and
all
my
happiness
is
to
be
with
him
is
he
not
wholly
mine
in
three
years
twice
at
intervals
he
was
himself
for
a
few
days
once
in
switzerland
where
we
went
and
once
in
an
island
off
the
wilds
of
brittany
where
we
took
some
i
have
twice
been
very
happy
i
can
live
on
memory
but
do
you
write
down
the
things
he
says
i
asked
why
should
i
said
she
i
was
silent
human
knowledge
was
indeed
as
nothing
in
this
eyes
at
those
times
when
he
talked
a
little
she
added
i
think
i
have
recorded
some
of
his
phrases
but
i
left
it
off
i
did
not
understand
him
then
i
asked
her
for
them
by
a
look
she
understood
me
this
is
what
i
have
been
able
to
preserve
from
oblivion
i
everything
here
on
earth
is
produced
by
an
ethereal
substance
which
is
the
common
element
of
various
phenomena
known
inaccurately
as
electricity
heat
light
the
galvanic
fluid
the
magnetic
fluid
and
so
forth
the
universal
distribution
of
this
substance
under
various
forms
constitutes
what
is
commonly
known
as
matter
ii
the
brain
is
the
alembic
to
which
the
animal
conveys
what
each
of
its
organizations
in
proportion
to
the
strength
of
that
vessel
can
absorb
of
that
substance
which
returns
it
transformed
into
will
the
will
is
a
fluid
inherent
in
every
creature
endowed
with
motion
hence
the
innumerable
forms
assumed
by
the
animal
the
results
of
its
combinations
with
that
substance
the
instincts
are
the
product
of
the
coercion
of
the
environment
in
which
it
develops
hence
its
variety
iii
in
man
the
will
becomes
a
power
peculiar
to
him
and
exceeding
in
intensity
that
of
any
other
species
iv
by
constant
assimilation
the
will
depends
on
the
substance
it
meets
with
again
and
again
in
all
its
transmutations
pervading
them
by
thought
which
is
a
product
peculiar
to
the
human
will
in
combination
with
the
modifications
of
that
substance
v
the
innumerable
forms
assumed
by
thought
are
the
result
of
the
greater
or
less
perfection
of
the
human
mechanism
vi
the
will
acts
through
organs
commonly
called
the
five
senses
which
in
fact
are
but
one
the
faculty
of
sight
feeling
and
tasting
hearing
and
smelling
are
sight
modified
to
the
transformations
of
the
substance
which
man
can
absorb
in
two
conditions
untransformed
and
transformed
vii
everything
of
which
the
form
comes
within
the
cognizance
of
the
one
sense
of
sight
may
be
reduced
to
certain
simple
bodies
of
which
the
elements
exist
in
the
air
the
light
or
in
the
elements
of
air
and
light
sound
is
a
condition
of
the
air
colors
are
all
conditions
of
light
every
smell
is
a
combination
of
air
and
light
hence
the
four
aspects
of
matter
with
regard
to
man
sound
color
smell
and
shape
have
the
same
origin
for
the
day
is
not
far
off
when
the
relationship
of
the
phenomena
of
air
and
light
will
be
made
clear
thought
which
is
allied
to
light
is
expressed
in
words
which
depend
on
sound
to
man
then
everything
is
derived
from
the
substance
whose
transformations
vary
only
through
number
a
certain
quantitative
dissimilarity
the
proportions
resulting
in
the
individuals
or
objects
of
what
are
classed
as
kingdoms
viii
when
the
substance
is
absorbed
in
sufficient
number
or
quantity
it
makes
of
man
an
immensely
powerful
mechanism
in
direct
communication
with
the
very
element
of
the
substance
and
acting
on
organic
nature
in
the
same
way
as
a
large
stream
when
it
absorbs
the
smaller
brooks
volition
sets
this
force
in
motion
independently
of
the
mind
by
its
concentration
it
acquires
some
of
the
qualities
of
the
substance
such
as
the
swiftness
of
light
the
penetrating
power
of
electricity
and
the
faculty
of
saturating
a
body
to
which
must
be
added
that
it
apprehends
what
it
can
do
still
there
is
in
man
a
primordial
and
overruling
phenomenon
which
defies
analysis
man
may
be
dissected
completely
the
elements
of
will
and
mind
may
perhaps
be
found
but
there
still
will
remain
beyond
apprehension
the
against
which
i
once
used
to
struggle
that
is
the
word
the
logos
whose
communication
burns
and
consumes
those
who
are
not
prepared
to
receive
it
the
word
is
for
ever
generating
the
substance
ix
rage
like
all
our
vehement
demonstrations
is
a
current
of
the
human
force
that
acts
electrically
its
turmoil
when
liberated
acts
on
persons
who
are
present
even
though
they
be
neither
its
cause
nor
its
object
are
there
not
certain
men
who
by
a
discharge
of
volition
can
sublimate
the
essence
of
the
feelings
of
the
masses
x
fanaticism
and
all
emotions
are
living
forces
these
forces
in
some
beings
become
rivers
that
gather
in
and
sweep
away
everything
xi
though
space
certain
faculties
have
the
power
of
traversing
it
with
such
rapidity
that
it
is
as
though
it
existed
not
from
your
own
bed
to
the
frontiers
of
the
universe
there
are
but
two
steps
will
and
faith
xii
facts
are
nothing
they
do
not
subsist
all
that
lives
of
us
is
the
idea
xiii
the
realm
of
ideas
is
divided
into
three
spheres
that
of
instinct
that
of
abstractions
that
of
specialism
xiv
the
greater
part
the
weaker
part
of
visible
humanity
dwells
in
the
sphere
of
instinct
the
are
born
labor
and
die
without
rising
to
the
second
degree
of
human
intelligence
namely
abstraction
xv
society
begins
in
the
sphere
of
abstraction
if
abstraction
as
compared
with
instinct
is
an
almost
divine
power
it
is
nevertheless
incredibly
weak
as
compared
with
the
gift
of
specialism
which
is
the
formula
of
god
abstraction
comprises
all
nature
in
a
germ
more
virtually
than
a
seed
contains
the
whole
system
of
a
plant
and
its
fruits
from
abstraction
are
derived
laws
arts
social
ideas
and
interests
it
is
the
glory
and
the
scourge
of
the
earth
its
glory
because
it
has
created
social
life
its
scourge
because
it
allows
man
to
evade
entering
into
specialism
which
is
one
of
the
paths
to
the
infinite
man
measures
everything
by
abstractions
good
and
evil
virtue
and
crime
its
formula
of
equity
is
a
pair
of
scales
its
justice
is
blind
god
justice
sees
there
is
all
the
difference
there
must
be
intermediate
beings
then
dividing
the
sphere
of
instinct
from
the
sphere
of
abstractions
in
whom
the
two
elements
mingle
in
an
infinite
variety
of
proportions
some
have
more
of
one
some
more
of
the
other
and
there
are
also
some
in
which
the
two
powers
neutralize
each
other
by
equality
of
effect
xvi
specialism
consists
in
seeing
the
things
of
the
material
universe
and
the
things
of
the
spiritual
universe
in
all
their
ramifications
original
and
causative
the
greatest
human
geniuses
are
those
who
started
from
the
darkness
of
abstraction
to
attain
to
the
light
of
specialism
specialism
sight
speculation
or
seeing
everything
and
all
at
once
a
mirror
or
means
of
apprehending
a
thing
by
seeing
the
whole
of
it
jesus
had
the
gift
of
specialism
he
saw
each
fact
in
its
root
and
in
its
results
in
the
past
where
it
had
its
rise
and
in
the
future
where
it
would
grow
and
spread
his
sight
pierced
into
the
understanding
of
others
the
perfection
of
the
inner
eye
gives
rise
to
the
gift
of
specialism
specialism
brings
with
it
intuition
intuition
is
one
of
the
faculties
of
the
inner
man
of
which
specialism
is
an
attribute
intuition
acts
by
an
imperceptible
sensation
of
which
he
who
obeys
it
is
not
conscious
for
instance
napoleon
instinctively
moving
from
a
spot
struck
immediately
afterwards
by
a
cannon
ball
xvii
between
the
sphere
of
abstraction
and
that
of
specialism
as
between
those
of
abstraction
and
instinct
there
are
beings
in
whom
the
attributes
of
both
combine
and
produce
a
mixture
these
are
men
of
genius
xviii
specialism
is
necessarily
the
most
perfect
expression
of
man
and
he
is
the
link
binding
the
visible
world
to
the
higher
worlds
he
acts
sees
and
feels
by
his
inner
powers
the
man
of
abstraction
thinks
the
man
of
instinct
acts
xix
hence
man
has
three
degrees
that
of
instinct
below
the
average
that
of
abstraction
the
general
average
that
of
specialism
above
the
average
specialism
opens
to
man
his
true
career
the
infinite
dawns
on
him
he
sees
what
his
destiny
must
be
xx
there
are
three
worlds
the
natural
the
spiritual
and
the
divine
humanity
passes
through
the
natural
world
which
is
not
fixed
either
in
its
essence
and
unfixed
in
its
faculties
the
spiritual
world
is
fixed
in
its
essence
and
unfixed
in
its
faculties
the
divine
world
is
necessarily
a
material
worship
a
spiritual
worship
and
a
divine
worship
three
forms
expressed
in
action
speech
and
prayer
or
in
other
words
in
deed
apprehension
and
love
instinct
demands
deed
abstraction
is
concerned
with
ideas
specialism
sees
the
end
it
aspires
to
god
with
presentiment
or
contemplation
xxi
hence
perhaps
some
day
the
converse
of
verbum
caro
factum
will
become
the
epitome
of
a
new
gospel
which
will
proclaim
that
the
flesh
shall
be
made
the
word
and
become
the
utterance
of
god
xxii
the
resurrection
is
the
work
of
the
wind
of
heaven
sweeping
over
the
worlds
the
angel
borne
on
the
wind
does
not
say
arise
ye
dead
he
says
arise
ye
who
live
such
are
the
meditations
which
i
have
with
great
difficulty
cast
in
a
form
adapted
to
our
understanding
there
are
some
others
which
pauline
remembered
more
exactly
wherefore
i
know
not
and
which
i
wrote
from
her
dictation
but
they
drive
the
mind
to
despair
when
knowing
in
what
an
intellect
they
originated
we
strive
to
understand
them
i
will
quote
a
few
of
them
to
complete
my
study
of
this
figure
partly
too
perhaps
because
in
these
last
aphorisms
lambert
formulas
seem
to
include
a
larger
universe
than
the
former
set
which
would
apply
only
to
zoological
evolution
still
there
is
a
relation
between
the
two
fragments
evident
to
those
persons
though
they
be
but
few
who
love
to
dive
into
such
intellectual
deeps
i
everything
on
earth
exists
solely
by
motion
and
number
ii
motion
is
so
to
speak
number
in
action
iii
motion
is
the
product
of
a
force
generated
by
the
word
and
by
resistance
which
is
matter
but
for
resistance
motion
would
have
had
no
results
its
action
would
have
been
infinite
gravitation
is
not
a
law
but
an
effect
of
the
general
law
of
universal
motion
iv
motion
acting
in
proportion
to
resistance
produces
a
result
which
is
life
as
soon
as
one
or
the
other
is
the
stronger
life
ceases
v
no
portion
of
motion
is
wasted
it
always
produces
number
still
it
can
be
neutralized
by
disproportionate
resistance
as
in
minerals
vi
number
which
produces
variety
of
all
kinds
also
gives
rise
to
harmony
which
in
the
highest
meaning
of
the
word
is
the
relation
of
parts
to
the
whole
vii
but
for
motion
everything
would
be
one
and
the
same
its
products
identical
in
their
essence
differ
only
by
number
which
gives
rise
to
faculties
viii
man
looks
to
faculties
angels
look
to
the
essence
ix
by
giving
his
body
up
to
elemental
action
man
can
achieve
an
inner
union
with
the
light
x
number
is
intellectual
evidence
belonging
to
man
alone
by
it
he
acquires
knowledge
of
the
word
xi
there
is
a
number
beyond
which
the
impure
can
not
pass
the
number
which
is
the
limit
of
creation
xii
the
unit
was
the
of
every
product
compounds
are
derived
from
it
but
the
end
must
be
identical
with
the
beginning
hence
this
spiritual
formula
the
compound
unit
the
variable
unit
the
fixed
unit
xiii
the
universe
is
the
unit
in
variety
motion
is
the
means
number
is
the
result
the
end
is
the
return
of
all
things
to
the
unit
which
is
god
xiv
three
and
seven
are
the
two
chief
spiritual
numbers
xv
three
is
the
formula
of
created
worlds
it
is
the
spiritual
sign
of
the
creation
as
it
is
the
material
sign
of
dimension
in
fact
god
has
worked
by
curved
lines
only
the
straight
line
is
an
attribute
of
the
infinite
and
man
who
has
the
presentiment
of
the
infinite
reproduces
it
in
his
works
two
is
the
number
of
generation
three
is
the
number
of
life
which
includes
generation
and
offspring
add
the
sum
of
four
and
you
have
seven
the
formula
of
heaven
above
all
is
god
he
is
the
unit
after
going
in
to
see
louis
once
more
i
took
leave
of
his
wife
and
went
home
lost
in
ideas
so
adverse
to
social
life
that
in
spite
of
a
promise
to
return
to
villenoix
i
did
not
go
the
sight
of
louis
had
had
some
mysteriously
sinister
influence
over
me
i
was
afraid
to
place
myself
again
in
that
heavy
atmosphere
where
ecstasy
was
contagious
any
man
would
have
felt
as
i
did
a
longing
to
throw
himself
into
the
infinite
just
as
one
soldier
after
another
killed
himself
in
a
certain
sentry
box
where
one
had
committed
suicide
in
the
camp
at
boulogne
it
is
a
known
fact
that
napoleon
was
obliged
to
have
the
hut
burned
which
had
harbored
an
idea
that
had
become
a
mortal
infection
louis
room
had
perhaps
the
same
fatal
effect
as
that
sentry
box
these
two
facts
would
then
be
additional
evidence
in
favor
of
his
theory
of
the
transfusion
of
will
i
was
conscious
of
strange
disturbances
transcending
the
most
fantastic
results
of
taking
tea
coffee
or
opium
of
dreams
or
of
fever
mysterious
agents
whose
terrible
action
often
sets
our
brains
on
fire
i
ought
perhaps
to
have
made
a
separate
book
of
these
fragments
of
thought
intelligible
only
to
certain
spirits
who
have
been
accustomed
to
lean
over
the
edge
of
abysses
in
the
hope
of
seeing
to
the
bottom
the
life
of
that
mighty
brain
which
split
up
on
every
side
perhaps
like
a
too
vast
empire
would
have
been
set
forth
in
the
narrative
of
this
man
visions
a
being
incomplete
for
lack
of
force
or
of
weakness
but
i
preferred
to
give
an
account
of
my
own
impressions
rather
than
to
compose
a
more
or
less
poetical
romance

was

all
unknown

that
he

haughtily
into

mademoiselle

however
have

quite
justified

has
been

constant
