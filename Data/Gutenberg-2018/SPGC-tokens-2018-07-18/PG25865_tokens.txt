chapter
i
a
gay
household
is
phelps
too
perfectly
sweet
that
is
the
loveliest
fan
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
and
to
think
it
mine
and
you
look
at
this
a
silver
oh
nan
may
i
make
it
work
sometimes
indeed
you
may
and
oh
see
this
a
piece
of
antique
japanese
bronze
is
it
i
do
like
it
as
well
as
the
sparkling
shiny
things
this
silver
tray
beats
it
all
hollow
did
you
ever
see
such
a
brightness
in
your
life
patty
you
hopelessly
philistine
but
that
tray
is
lovely
and
of
an
exquisite
design
patty
and
nan
were
unpacking
wedding
presents
and
the
room
was
strewn
with
boxes
tissue
paper
cotton
wool
and
packing
only
three
days
more
and
then
nan
allen
was
to
marry
fairfield
patty
father
patty
was
spending
the
whole
week
at
the
allen
home
in
philadelphia
and
was
almost
as
much
interested
in
the
wedding
preparations
as
nan
herself
i
do
think
there
anything
so
much
fun
as
a
house
with
a
wedding
fuss
in
it
said
patty
to
allen
as
nan
mother
came
into
the
room
where
the
girls
were
just
wait
till
you
come
to
your
own
wedding
fuss
and
then
see
if
you
think
it
so
much
fun
said
nan
who
was
rapidly
scribbling
names
of
friends
to
whom
she
must
write
notes
of
acknowledgment
for
their
gifts
that
too
far
in
the
future
even
to
think
of
said
patty
and
besides
i
must
get
my
father
married
and
settled
before
i
can
think
of
myself
she
wagged
her
head
at
nan
with
a
comical
look
and
they
all
laughed
it
was
a
great
joke
that
patty
father
should
be
about
to
marry
her
dear
girl
friend
but
patty
was
mightily
pleased
at
the
prospect
and
looked
forward
with
happiness
to
the
enlarged
home
circle
the
trouble
is
said
patty
i
do
know
what
to
call
this
august
personage
who
insists
on
becoming
my
father
wife
i
shall
rule
you
with
a
rod
of
iron
said
nan
and
you
stand
so
in
awe
of
me
that
you
wo
dare
to
call
me
anything
you
think
so
do
you
said
patty
saucily
well
just
let
me
inform
you
fairfield
that
is
to
be
that
i
intend
to
lead
you
a
dance
you
be
responsible
for
my
manners
and
behaviour
and
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
undertaking
i
think
i
shall
call
you
do
said
nan
placidly
and
i
call
you
stepdaughter
patricia
joking
aside
said
patty
honestly
nan
i
am
perfectly
delighted
that
the
time
is
coming
so
soon
to
have
you
with
us
ever
since
last
fall
i
have
waited
patiently
and
it
seemed
as
if
easter
would
never
come
we
have
good
times
though
after
you
get
back
from
your
trip
and
we
get
settled
in
that
lovely
house
in
new
york
if
only
i
did
have
to
go
to
school
and
study
like
fury
out
of
school
too
we
could
have
heaps
of
fun
i
afraid
you
studying
too
hard
patty
said
allen
looking
at
her
young
guest
she
is
mother
said
nan
and
i
wish
she
would
why
do
you
do
it
patty
well
you
see
it
this
way
i
found
out
the
first
of
the
year
that
i
was
ahead
of
my
class
in
some
studies
and
that
if
i
worked
extra
hard
i
could
get
ahead
on
the
other
studies
and
well
i
ca
exactly
explain
it
but
it
like
putting
two
years
work
into
one
and
then
i
could
graduate
from
the
oliphant
school
this
june
instead
of
going
there
another
year
as
i
had
expected
then
if
i
do
that
papa
says
i
may
stay
home
next
year
and
just
have
masters
in
music
and
french
and
whatever
branches
i
want
to
keep
up
so
i
trying
but
i
hardly
think
i
can
pass
the
examinations
after
all
well
you
not
going
to
study
while
you
here
said
allen
and
after
we
get
nan
packed
off
on
thursday
you
and
i
are
going
to
have
lovely
times
you
must
stay
with
me
as
long
as
you
can
for
i
shall
be
dreadfully
lonesome
without
my
own
girl
thank
you
dear
allen
i
am
very
happy
here
and
i
love
to
stay
with
you
but
of
course
i
can
stay
only
as
long
as
our
easter
vacation
lasts
i
must
go
back
to
new
york
the
early
part
of
next
week
well
we
cram
all
the
fun
possible
into
the
few
days
you
are
here
then
and
patty
gay
little
hostess
bustled
away
to
look
after
her
household
appointments
allen
was
of
a
social
nature
indeed
it
was
often
said
that
she
cared
more
for
parties
and
festive
gatherings
than
did
her
daughter
nan
nobody
was
surprised
to
learn
that
nan
allen
was
to
marry
a
man
many
years
older
than
herself
the
surprise
came
when
they
met
fairfield
and
discovered
that
that
gentleman
appeared
to
be
much
younger
than
he
undoubtedly
was
for
patty
father
though
nearly
forty
years
old
had
a
frank
ingenuous
manner
and
a
smile
that
was
almost
boyish
in
its
gaiety
allen
was
in
her
element
superintending
her
daughter
wedding
and
the
whole
affair
was
to
be
on
a
most
elaborate
scale
far
more
so
than
nan
herself
wished
for
her
tastes
were
simple
and
she
would
have
preferred
a
quieter
celebration
of
the
occasion
but
as
allen
said
it
was
her
last
opportunity
to
provide
an
entertainment
for
her
daughter
and
she
would
not
allow
her
plans
to
be
thwarted
so
preparations
for
the
great
event
went
busily
on
carpenters
came
and
enclosed
the
wide
verandas
and
decorators
came
and
hung
the
newly
made
walls
with
white
cheese
cloth
and
trimmed
them
with
garlands
of
green
the
house
was
invaded
with
decorators
caterers
and
helpers
of
all
sorts
while
neighbours
and
friends
of
allen
and
of
nan
flew
in
and
out
at
all
hours
the
was
continually
thronged
by
admiring
friends
who
never
tired
of
looking
at
the
beautiful
gifts
already
upon
the
tables
or
watching
the
opening
of
new
ones
there
the
thirteenth
said
nan
as
she
tore
the
tissue
paper
wrapping
from
an
exquisite
piece
of
sparkling
glass
i
should
think
it
an
unlucky
number
if
i
did
feel
sure
that
one
or
two
more
would
come
yet
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
all
nan
asked
one
of
her
girl
friends
shall
you
exchange
any
of
your
duplicate
gifts
no
indeed
said
nan
i
too
conservative
and
to
exchange
my
wedding
gifts
i
shall
keep
the
whole
thirteen
and
then
when
one
gets
broken
i
can
replace
it
with
another
accidents
will
happen
you
know
but
not
thirteen
times
and
all
said
patty
laughing
have
to
use
them
as
individuals
nan
when
you
give
a
dinner
party
of
twelve
each
guest
can
have
a
separate
which
will
be
very
convenient
i
do
care
said
nan
taking
the
jest
i
shall
keep
them
all
no
matter
how
many
i
get
and
i
always
did
like
anyway
another
great
excitement
was
when
nan
gowns
were
sent
home
from
the
dressmaker
patty
was
frankly
fond
of
pretty
clothes
and
she
fairly
revelled
in
nan
beautiful
to
please
patty
the
tried
them
all
on
one
after
another
and
each
seemed
more
beautiful
than
the
one
before
when
at
last
nan
stood
arrayed
in
her
bridal
gown
with
veil
and
orange
blossoms
complete
patty
ecstacy
knew
no
bounds
you
are
a
picture
nan
she
cried
a
perfect
dream
i
never
saw
such
a
beautiful
bride
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
coming
to
live
with
us
and
then
i
can
try
on
that
white
satin
confection
and
prance
around
in
it
myself
they
all
laughed
at
this
and
nan
exclaimed
in
mock
reproach
i
like
to
see
you
do
it
miss
prance
around
in
my
wedding
gown
indeed
have
you
no
more
respect
for
your
elderly
and
antiquated
stepmamma
than
that
patty
giggled
at
nan
pretended
severity
and
danced
round
her
patting
a
fold
here
and
picking
out
a
bow
there
and
having
a
good
time
generally
the
next
day
there
was
a
luncheon
to
which
allen
had
invited
a
number
of
nan
dearest
girl
friends
patty
enjoyed
this
especially
for
not
only
did
she
dearly
love
a
pretty
affair
of
this
sort
but
allen
had
let
her
help
with
the
preparations
and
patty
had
even
suggested
some
original
ideas
which
found
favour
in
allen
eyes
over
the
table
was
suspended
a
floral
wedding
bell
which
was
supplied
with
not
only
one
clapper
but
a
dozen
these
clappers
were
ingenious
little
contrivances
and
from
each
hung
a
long
and
narrow
white
ribbon
after
the
luncheon
each
ribbon
was
apportioned
to
a
guest
and
at
a
given
signal
the
ribbons
were
pulled
whereupon
each
clapper
sprang
open
and
a
tiny
white
paper
fluttered
down
to
the
table
illustration
patty
fairly
reveled
in
nan
beautiful
trousseau
these
papers
each
bore
the
name
of
one
of
the
guests
and
when
opened
were
found
to
contain
a
rhymed
jingle
foretelling
in
a
humorous
way
the
fate
of
each
girl
patty
had
written
the
merry
little
verses
and
they
were
read
aloud
amid
much
laughter
and
fun
as
patty
did
not
know
these
philadelphia
girls
very
well
many
of
her
verses
which
foretold
their
fates
were
necessarily
merely
graceful
little
jingles
without
any
attempt
at
special
appropriateness
one
which
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
dainty
little
girl
ran
thus
your
cheeks
are
red
your
eyes
are
blue
your
hair
is
gold
your
heart
is
too
another
which
was
applied
to
a
specially
maiden
read
thus
the
longer
you
live
the
sweeter
you
grow
your
fair
cup
of
joy
shall
have
no
trace
of
woe
but
some
of
the
girls
had
special
hopes
or
interests
and
these
patty
touched
upon
an
aspiring
music
lover
was
thus
warned
if
you
would
really
learn
to
play
pray
practice
seven
hours
a
day
and
then
perhaps
at
last
you
may
and
an
earnest
art
student
received
this
somewhat
doubtful
encouragement
you
try
to
paint
in
oil
and
your
persistent
toil
will
many
a
canvas
spoil
patty
own
verse
was
a
little
hit
at
her
dislike
for
study
and
her
taste
in
another
direction
little
you
care
to
read
a
book
but
goodness
me
how
you
can
cook
nan
came
last
of
all
and
she
read
it
aloud
amid
the
gay
laughter
of
the
girls
ere
many
days
shall
pass
your
fair
head
your
fate
is
pretty
lady
to
be
wed
yet
scarcely
can
you
be
a
happy
wife
for
patty
will
lead
you
such
a
life
the
girls
thought
these
merry
little
jingles
great
fun
and
each
carefully
preserved
her
fortune
to
take
home
as
a
souvenir
of
the
occasion
bumble
barlow
was
at
this
luncheon
for
the
barlows
were
friends
and
near
neighbours
of
the
allens
readers
who
knew
patty
in
her
earlier
years
will
remember
bumble
as
the
cousin
who
lived
at
the
down
on
long
island
although
bumble
was
a
little
older
and
insisted
on
being
called
by
her
real
name
of
helen
she
was
the
same
old
mischievous
as
ever
she
was
delighted
to
see
patty
again
and
coaxed
her
to
come
and
stay
with
them
instead
of
with
the
allens
but
allen
would
not
hear
of
such
an
arrangement
and
could
only
be
induced
to
give
her
consent
that
patty
should
spend
one
day
with
the
barlows
during
her
visit
in
philadelphia
the
short
time
that
was
left
before
the
wedding
day
flew
by
as
if
on
wings
so
much
was
going
on
both
in
the
line
of
gaiety
and
entertainment
and
also
by
way
of
preparation
for
the
great
event
that
patty
began
to
wonder
whether
social
life
was
not
after
all
as
wearing
as
the
more
prosaic
school
work
but
allen
said
when
this
question
was
referred
to
her
not
a
bit
of
it
all
this
gaiety
does
you
good
patty
you
need
recreation
from
that
everlasting
grind
of
school
work
and
you
go
back
to
it
next
week
refreshed
and
ready
to
do
better
work
than
ever
i
sure
of
it
said
patty
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
fun
having
this
week
it
just
like
a
bit
of
fairyland
i
never
had
such
an
experience
before
patty
life
had
been
one
of
simple
pleasures
and
duties
she
had
a
great
capacity
for
enjoyment
but
heretofore
had
only
known
fun
and
frolic
of
a
more
childish
nature
this
glimpse
into
what
seemed
to
be
really
truly
society
was
bewildering
and
very
enjoyable
and
patty
found
it
quite
easy
to
adapt
herself
to
its
requirements
chapter
ii
wedding
bells
at
last
the
wedding
day
arrived
and
a
brighter
or
more
sunshiny
day
could
not
have
been
asked
for
by
the
most
exacting
of
brides
it
was
to
be
an
evening
wedding
but
from
early
in
the
morning
there
was
a
constant
succession
of
exciting
events
the
last
touches
were
being
put
to
the
decorations
belated
presents
were
coming
in
house
guests
were
arriving
messengers
coming
and
going
and
through
it
all
allen
bustled
about
supremely
happy
in
watching
the
culminating
success
of
her
elaborate
plans
patty
looked
at
her
with
a
wondering
admiration
for
she
always
admired
capability
and
allen
was
exhibiting
what
might
almost
be
called
generalship
in
her
house
that
day
of
course
patty
had
no
care
or
responsibility
and
nothing
to
do
but
enjoy
herself
so
she
did
this
thoroughly
in
the
morning
marian
and
frank
elliott
came
they
were
staying
at
the
barlows
and
fairfield
was
staying
there
too
it
sometimes
seemed
to
patty
that
her
father
ought
to
have
played
a
more
prominent
part
in
all
the
preliminary
festivities
but
allen
calmly
told
her
in
fairfield
presence
that
a
bridegroom
had
no
part
in
wedding
affairs
until
the
time
of
the
ceremony
itself
fairfield
laughed
and
replied
that
he
was
quite
satisfied
to
be
left
out
of
the
mad
rush
until
the
real
occasion
came
like
nan
fairfield
would
have
preferred
a
quiet
wedding
but
allen
utterly
refused
to
hear
of
such
a
thing
nan
was
her
only
daughter
and
this
her
only
chance
to
arrange
an
entertainment
such
as
her
soul
delighted
in
allen
was
willing
to
indulge
his
wife
in
her
wishes
and
was
exceedingly
hospitable
by
nature
moreover
he
took
great
pride
in
his
charming
daughter
and
wanted
everything
done
that
could
in
any
way
contribute
to
the
success
or
add
to
the
beauty
of
her
wedding
celebration
patty
fluttered
around
the
house
in
a
sort
of
inconsequent
delight
now
in
the
looking
over
the
beautiful
collection
now
chatting
with
her
cousins
or
other
friends
now
strolling
through
the
great
parlours
with
their
wonderful
decorations
of
banked
roses
and
ceilings
dinner
was
early
that
night
as
the
ceremony
was
to
be
performed
at
eight
and
after
dinner
patty
flew
to
her
room
to
don
her
own
beautiful
new
gown
this
dress
delighted
patty
heart
it
was
a
white
tulle
sprinkled
with
silver
and
its
soft
dainty
glitter
seemed
to
patty
like
moonlight
on
the
snow
her
hair
was
done
low
on
her
neck
in
a
most
becoming
fashion
and
her
only
ornament
was
a
necklace
of
pearls
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
and
which
her
father
had
given
her
that
very
day
the
first
fairfield
had
died
when
patty
was
a
mere
baby
so
of
course
she
had
no
recollection
of
her
but
she
had
always
idealised
the
personality
of
her
mother
and
she
took
the
beautiful
pearls
from
her
father
with
almost
a
feeling
of
reverence
as
she
touched
them
i
so
glad
it
nan
you
going
to
marry
papa
she
said
i
like
it
as
well
if
it
were
somebody
who
would
really
try
to
be
a
stepmother
to
me
but
dear
old
nan
is
more
like
a
sister
and
i
so
glad
she
ours
i
glad
you
pleased
patty
dear
and
i
only
hope
nan
will
never
regret
marrying
a
man
so
much
older
than
herself
you
not
old
papa
fairfield
cried
patty
indignantly
i
wo
have
you
say
such
a
thing
why
you
not
forty
yet
and
nan
is
why
that
hardly
any
difference
at
all
so
nan
says
said
fairfield
smiling
so
i
dare
say
my
arithmetic
at
fault
of
course
it
is
said
patty
and
you
do
look
a
bit
old
either
why
you
look
as
young
as
hepworth
and
he
looks
nearly
as
young
as
kenneth
and
kenneth
only
two
years
older
than
i
am
that
sounds
a
little
complicated
patty
but
i
sure
you
mean
it
as
a
compliment
so
i
take
it
as
such
a
little
before
eight
patty
in
her
shimmering
gown
went
dancing
downstairs
the
rooms
were
already
crowded
with
guests
and
the
first
familiar
face
patty
saw
was
that
of
hepworth
who
came
toward
her
with
a
glad
smile
of
greeting
how
we
are
looking
he
said
i
shall
have
to
paint
your
portrait
all
over
again
and
you
must
wear
that
gown
and
we
will
call
it
moonlight
sonata
and
send
it
to
the
exhibition
that
will
be
lovely
exclaimed
patty
but
can
you
paint
silver
well
i
could
try
to
get
a
silvery
effect
at
least
that
would
do
it
must
be
the
real
thing
i
think
you
could
only
get
it
right
by
using
aluminum
paint
like
they
paint
the
with
yes
said
hepworth
that
would
be
realistic
at
least
but
i
see
a
crowd
of
your
young
friends
coming
this
way
and
i
feel
quite
sure
they
mean
to
carry
you
off
so
wo
you
promise
me
a
dance
or
two
when
the
time
comes
for
that
part
of
the
programme
yes
indeed
said
patty
and
there
is
going
to
be
dancing
after
the
supper
hepworth
looked
after
patty
as
all
unconscious
of
his
gaze
she
went
on
through
the
rooms
with
the
young
friends
who
had
claimed
her
gilbert
hepworth
had
long
realised
his
growing
interest
in
patty
and
acknowledged
to
himself
that
he
loved
the
girl
devotedly
but
he
had
never
by
word
or
look
intimated
this
and
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
until
she
should
be
some
years
older
he
himself
was
and
he
knew
that
must
seem
old
indeed
to
a
girl
of
seventeen
so
he
really
had
little
hope
that
he
ever
could
win
her
for
his
own
but
he
allowed
himself
the
pleasure
of
her
society
whenever
opportunity
offered
and
it
pleased
him
to
do
for
her
such
acts
of
courtesy
and
kindness
as
could
not
be
construed
into
special
attentions
or
indication
of
an
unwelcome
devotion
among
the
group
that
surrounded
patty
was
kenneth
harper
a
college
boy
who
was
a
good
chum
of
patty
and
a
favourite
with
fairfield
marian
and
frank
were
with
them
also
bob
and
bumble
the
barlow
twins
and
a
number
of
the
philadelphia
young
people
this
group
laughed
and
chatted
merrily
until
the
orchestra
struck
up
the
wedding
march
and
an
expectant
hush
fell
upon
the
assembly
at
nan
special
request
there
were
no
bridesmaids
and
when
the
bride
entered
with
her
father
she
was
as
patty
had
prophesied
a
perfect
picture
in
her
beautiful
wedding
gown
fairfield
seemed
to
think
so
too
and
his
happy
smile
as
he
came
to
meet
her
gave
patty
a
thrill
of
gladness
to
think
that
this
happiness
had
come
to
her
father
his
life
had
been
lonely
and
she
was
glad
that
it
was
to
be
shared
by
such
a
truly
sweet
and
lovely
woman
as
nan
patty
was
the
first
to
congratulate
the
wedded
pair
and
hepworth
who
was
an
usher
escorted
her
up
to
them
that
she
might
do
so
patty
kissed
both
the
bride
and
the
bridegroom
with
affection
and
after
a
few
merry
words
turned
away
to
give
place
to
others
come
on
patty
said
kenneth
a
whole
crowd
of
us
are
going
to
camp
out
in
one
of
those
jolly
cozy
corners
on
the
verandah
and
have
our
supper
there
so
patty
went
with
the
merry
crowd
and
found
that
kenneth
had
selected
a
conveniently
located
spot
near
one
of
the
windows
i
so
glad
it
supper
time
she
said
as
they
settled
themselves
comfortably
in
their
chosen
retreat
i
been
so
busy
and
excited
that
i
hardly
eaten
a
thing
and
i
starving
with
hunger
and
now
that
i
got
my
father
safely
married
and
off
my
hands
i
feel
relieved
of
a
great
responsibility
and
can
eat
my
supper
with
a
mind
at
rest
when
i
married
said
helen
barlow
i
mean
to
have
a
wedding
exactly
like
this
one
i
think
it
the
loveliest
one
i
ever
saw
you
wo
though
bumble
said
patty
laughing
in
the
first
place
you
forget
to
order
your
wedding
gown
until
a
day
or
two
before
the
occasion
and
of
course
it
wo
be
done
and
then
you
forget
to
send
out
the
invitations
so
of
course
you
have
no
guests
and
i
sure
you
forget
to
invite
the
minister
so
there
be
no
ceremony
anyway
bumble
laughed
at
this
for
the
ways
of
the
barlow
family
were
well
known
to
everybody
it
would
be
that
way
she
said
if
i
looked
after
things
myself
but
i
shall
expect
you
patty
to
take
entire
charge
of
the
occasion
and
then
everything
will
go
along
like
clockwork
are
you
staying
long
in
philadelphia
miss
fairfield
asked
ethel
banks
a
philadelphia
girl
who
lived
not
far
from
the
allens
a
few
days
longer
said
patty
i
have
to
go
back
to
new
york
next
tuesday
and
then
no
more
gaiety
for
me
i
do
know
how
i
shall
survive
such
a
sudden
change
but
after
this
mad
whirl
of
parties
and
things
i
have
to
come
down
to
plain
everyday
studying
of
lessons
but
we
talk
about
that
now
it
a
painful
subject
to
me
at
any
time
but
especially
when
i
at
a
party
me
too
said
kenneth
if
ever
i
get
through
college
i
do
think
i
want
to
see
a
book
for
the
next
twenty
years
i
did
know
you
hated
your
lessons
so
kenneth
said
marian
i
thought
patty
was
the
only
one
of
my
friends
who
was
willing
to
avow
that
she
was
like
that
little
paul
who
did
like
study
at
all
yes
i
a
paul
too
said
kenneth
and
i
may
as
well
own
up
to
it
but
you
do
let
it
interfere
with
your
work
said
patty
you
dig
just
as
hard
as
if
you
really
enjoyed
it
so
do
you
said
kenneth
but
some
day
after
we
have
both
been
graduated
i
suppose
we
be
glad
that
we
did
our
digging
after
all
a
little
later
and
fairfield
went
away
amid
showers
of
and
after
that
there
was
an
hour
of
informal
dancing
patty
was
besieged
with
partners
asking
for
a
dance
and
as
there
was
no
programme
she
would
make
no
promises
but
accepted
whoever
might
ask
her
first
at
the
beginning
of
each
dance
she
liked
to
dance
with
kenneth
for
his
step
suited
hers
perfectly
and
her
cousin
bob
was
also
an
exceptionally
good
dancer
but
patty
showed
no
partiality
and
enjoyed
all
the
dances
with
her
usual
enthusiasm
suddenly
she
remembered
that
she
had
promised
hepworth
a
dance
but
he
had
not
come
to
claim
it
wondering
she
looked
around
to
see
where
he
might
be
and
discovered
him
watching
her
from
across
the
room
there
was
an
amused
smile
on
his
face
and
patty
went
to
him
and
asked
him
in
her
direct
way
why
he
did
claim
his
dance
you
are
so
surrounded
he
said
by
other
and
more
attractive
partners
that
i
hated
to
disturb
you
nonsense
said
patty
without
a
trace
of
or
embarrassment
i
like
you
better
than
lots
of
these
philadelphia
boys
come
on
thank
you
for
the
compliment
said
hepworth
as
they
began
to
dance
but
you
seemed
to
be
finding
these
philadelphia
boys
very
agreeable
they
nice
enough
said
patty
carelessly
and
some
of
them
are
good
dancers
but
not
as
good
as
you
are
hepworth
do
you
know
you
dance
like
a
like
a
i
never
met
a
but
i
sure
they
must
be
delightful
people
to
judge
from
the
enthusiastic
tone
in
which
you
mention
them
do
you
never
get
tired
of
parties
and
dancing
patty
oh
no
indeed
i
love
it
all
but
you
see
i
have
had
very
much
never
been
to
but
two
or
three
real
in
my
life
why
only
just
outgrown
children
parties
i
may
get
tired
of
it
all
after
two
or
three
seasons
but
as
yet
it
such
a
novelty
to
me
that
i
enjoy
every
speck
of
it
hepworth
suddenly
realised
how
many
social
seasons
he
had
been
through
and
how
far
removed
he
was
from
this
young
débutante
in
his
views
on
such
matters
he
assured
himself
that
he
need
never
hope
she
would
take
any
special
interest
in
him
and
he
vowed
she
should
never
know
of
his
feelings
toward
her
so
he
adapted
his
mood
to
hers
and
chatted
gaily
of
the
events
of
the
evening
patty
told
him
of
the
many
pleasures
that
had
been
planned
for
her
during
the
rest
of
her
visit
at
allen
and
he
was
truly
glad
that
the
girl
was
to
have
a
taste
of
the
social
gaiety
that
so
strongly
appealed
to
her
miss
fairfield
said
ethel
banks
coming
up
to
patty
as
the
music
stopped
i
been
talking
with
my
father
and
he
says
if
you
and
and
allen
will
go
he
take
us
all
in
the
automobile
down
to
atlantic
city
for
the
how
perfectly
gorgeous
cried
patty
her
eyes
dancing
with
delight
i
love
to
go
i
never
been
in
an
automobile
but
a
few
times
in
my
life
and
never
for
such
a
long
trip
as
that
let
go
and
ask
allen
at
once
without
further
thought
of
hepworth
save
to
give
him
a
smiling
nod
as
she
turned
away
patty
went
with
ethel
to
ask
allen
about
the
projected
trip
allen
was
delighted
to
go
and
said
she
would
also
answer
for
her
husband
so
it
was
arranged
and
the
girls
went
dancing
back
to
banks
to
tell
him
so
ethel
father
was
a
hospitable
man
whose
principal
thought
was
to
give
pleasure
to
his
only
child
ethel
had
no
mother
and
allen
had
often
before
chaperoned
the
girl
on
similar
excursions
to
the
one
now
in
prospect
as
banks
was
an
enthusiastic
motorist
and
drove
his
own
car
there
was
ample
room
for
and
allen
and
patty
soon
the
wedding
guests
departed
and
patty
was
glad
to
take
off
her
pretty
gown
and
tumble
into
bed
she
slept
late
the
next
morning
and
awoke
to
find
allen
sitting
on
the
bed
beside
her
caressing
her
curly
hair
i
hate
to
waken
you
said
that
lady
but
it
after
ten
and
you
know
you
are
to
go
to
your
cousin
helen
to
spend
the
day
i
want
you
to
come
home
early
this
evening
as
i
have
a
little
party
planned
for
you
and
so
it
only
right
that
you
should
start
as
soon
as
possible
this
morning
here
is
a
nice
cup
of
cocoa
and
a
bit
of
toast
let
me
slip
a
kimono
around
you
while
you
breakfast
in
her
usual
busy
way
allen
fluttered
about
while
she
talked
and
after
putting
a
kimono
round
her
visitor
she
drew
up
beside
her
a
small
table
containing
a
dainty
breakfast
tray
it
just
as
well
you
going
away
allen
chattered
on
because
the
house
is
a
perfect
sight
not
one
thing
is
in
its
place
and
about
a
dozen
men
have
already
arrived
to
try
to
straighten
out
the
chaos
so
as
you
may
judge
my
dear
since
i
have
to
superintend
all
these
things
i
really
get
along
better
without
you
now
you
get
dressed
and
run
right
along
to
the
barlows
james
will
take
you
over
in
the
pony
cart
and
he
come
for
you
again
at
eight
this
evening
mind
now
you
not
to
stay
a
minute
after
eight
for
i
have
invited
some
young
people
here
to
see
you
i
send
the
carriage
and
then
you
can
bring
your
barlow
cousins
back
with
you
as
allen
rattled
on
she
had
been
fussing
around
the
room
getting
out
patty
clothes
to
wear
that
day
and
acting
in
such
a
generally
motherly
manner
that
patty
felt
sure
she
must
be
missing
nan
and
she
could
help
feeling
very
sorry
for
her
and
told
her
so
yes
said
allen
it
awful
i
only
just
begun
to
realise
that
i
lost
my
girl
still
it
had
to
come
i
suppose
sooner
or
later
and
i
would
put
a
straw
in
the
way
of
nan
happiness
well
i
shall
get
used
to
it
in
time
i
suppose
and
then
sometimes
i
shall
expect
nan
to
come
and
visit
me
chapter
iii
atlantic
city
patty
day
at
the
barlows
was
a
decided
contrast
to
her
visit
at
allen
in
the
allen
home
every
detail
of
housekeeping
was
complete
and
very
carefully
looked
after
while
at
the
barlows
everything
went
along
in
a
slipshod
fashion
patty
well
remembered
her
visit
at
their
summer
home
which
they
called
the
and
she
could
not
see
that
their
city
residence
was
any
less
deserving
of
the
name
her
aunt
grace
and
uncle
ted
were
jolly
people
who
cared
little
about
system
or
method
in
their
home
the
result
was
that
things
often
went
wrong
but
nobody
cared
especially
if
they
did
i
meant
to
have
a
nicer
luncheon
for
you
patty
said
her
aunt
as
they
sat
down
at
the
table
but
the
cook
forgot
to
order
lobsters
and
when
i
telephoned
for
fresh
peas
the
grocer
said
i
was
too
late
for
they
were
all
sold
i
so
sorry
for
i
do
love
hothouse
peas
do
you
i
do
care
what
i
have
to
eat
aunt
grace
i
just
came
to
visit
you
people
you
know
and
the
luncheon
does
matter
a
bit
that
nice
of
you
to
say
so
child
i
remember
what
an
adaptable
little
thing
you
were
when
you
were
with
us
down
in
the
country
and
really
you
did
us
quite
a
lot
of
good
that
summer
you
taught
bumble
how
to
keep
her
bureau
drawers
in
order
she
forgotten
it
now
but
it
was
nice
while
it
lasted
mother
i
do
wish
you
would
call
me
helen
bumble
is
such
a
silly
name
i
know
it
my
dear
said
barlow
placidly
and
i
do
mean
to
but
you
see
i
forget
i
forget
it
too
said
patty
but
i
try
to
call
you
helen
if
you
want
me
to
what
time
does
uncle
ted
come
home
aunt
grace
oh
about
five
or
perhaps
six
and
sometimes
he
gets
here
at
four
i
never
know
what
time
he
coming
home
it
is
only
that
said
bob
in
fact
father
usually
comes
home
about
the
same
time
but
our
clocks
are
all
so
different
that
it
depends
on
which
room
mother
is
in
as
to
what
time
she
thinks
it
is
that
so
said
helen
we
have
eleven
clocks
in
this
house
patty
and
every
one
of
them
is
always
wrong
still
it
convenient
in
a
way
if
you
want
to
go
anywhere
at
a
certain
time
no
matter
what
time
you
start
you
can
always
find
at
least
one
clock
that
about
where
you
want
it
to
be
i
sure
i
do
see
why
the
clocks
do
keep
the
right
time
said
barlow
a
man
comes
every
saturday
on
purpose
to
wind
and
set
them
all
we
fool
with
them
confessed
bob
you
see
patty
we
all
like
to
get
up
late
and
we
set
our
clocks
back
every
night
so
that
we
can
do
it
with
a
good
grace
yes
said
helen
and
then
if
we
want
each
other
to
go
anywhere
through
the
day
on
time
you
know
we
go
around
the
house
and
set
all
the
clocks
forward
that
the
only
possible
way
to
make
anybody
hurry
up
patty
laughed
the
whole
conversation
was
so
characteristic
of
the
barlows
as
she
remembered
them
and
she
wondered
how
they
could
enjoy
living
in
such
a
careless
way
but
they
were
an
especially
happy
family
and
most
hospitable
and
entertaining
patty
thoroughly
enjoyed
her
afternoon
although
they
did
nothing
in
particular
for
her
entertainment
but
aunt
grace
was
very
fond
of
her
motherless
niece
and
the
twins
just
adored
patty
at
five
tea
was
served
and
though
the
appointments
were
not
at
all
like
allen
carefully
equipped
service
yet
it
was
an
hour
of
comfortable
enjoyment
uncle
ted
came
home
and
he
was
so
merry
and
full
of
jokes
that
he
made
them
all
laugh
two
or
three
casual
callers
dropped
in
and
patty
thought
again
as
she
sometimes
did
that
perhaps
she
liked
her
barlow
cousins
best
of
all
dinner
not
entirely
to
patty
surprise
showed
some
of
the
same
characteristics
as
luncheon
had
done
the
salad
course
was
lacking
because
the
mayonnaise
dressing
had
been
upset
in
the
refrigerator
the
ice
cream
was
spoiled
because
by
mistake
the
freezer
had
been
set
in
the
sun
until
the
ice
melted
and
the
pretty
pink
pyramid
was
in
a
state
of
soft
collapse
but
as
aunt
grace
cheerfully
remarked
if
it
had
been
that
it
would
have
been
something
else
and
it
did
matter
much
anyway
it
was
this
happy
philosophy
of
the
barlow
family
that
charmed
patty
so
and
it
left
no
room
for
embarrassment
at
these
minor
accidents
either
on
the
part
of
the
family
or
their
guest
now
said
patty
after
dinner
if
necessary
i
going
to
set
all
the
clocks
forward
for
helen
i
do
want
you
to
be
ready
when
allen
sends
for
us
she
does
like
to
be
kept
waiting
one
bit
never
mind
the
clocks
patty
said
helen
i
be
ready
she
scampered
off
to
dress
and
sure
enough
was
entirely
ready
before
the
carriage
came
you
see
patty
she
said
we
do
things
on
time
only
fallen
into
the
habit
of
not
doing
so
unless
there
somebody
like
you
here
to
spur
us
up
patty
admitted
this
but
told
bumble
that
she
was
sorry
her
influence
was
not
more
lasting
on
saturday
they
started
with
the
banks
on
the
automobile
trip
allen
provided
patty
with
a
long
coat
for
the
journey
and
a
veil
to
tie
over
her
hat
not
being
accustomed
to
motoring
patty
did
not
have
appropriate
garments
and
allen
took
delight
in
fitting
her
out
with
some
of
nan
banks
was
of
the
largest
and
finest
type
it
was
what
is
called
a
palace
touring
car
and
represented
the
highest
degree
of
comfort
and
luxury
patty
had
never
been
in
such
a
beautiful
machine
and
when
she
was
snugly
tucked
in
the
tonneau
between
allen
and
ethel
banks
and
allen
climbed
into
the
front
seat
and
they
started
off
the
ride
to
atlantic
city
was
most
exhilarating
and
patty
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
there
was
a
top
to
the
machine
for
which
reason
the
force
of
the
wind
was
not
so
uncomfortable
and
the
tourists
were
able
to
converse
with
each
other
i
thought
said
patty
that
when
people
went
in
these
big
cars
at
this
fearful
rate
of
speed
you
could
hardly
hear
yourself
think
much
less
talk
to
each
other
what
the
name
of
your
car
mr
banks
the
flying
dutchman
was
the
reply
it
a
flyer
all
right
said
patty
but
i
do
see
anything
dutch
about
it
that
in
honour
of
one
of
my
ancestors
who
they
tell
me
came
over
from
holland
some
hundreds
of
years
ago
then
it
a
most
appropriate
name
said
patty
and
it
the
most
beautiful
and
comfortable
car
i
ever
saw
they
went
spinning
on
mile
after
mile
at
what
patty
thought
was
terrific
speed
but
which
banks
seemed
to
consider
merely
moderate
after
a
while
seeing
how
interested
patty
was
in
the
mechanism
of
the
car
allen
offered
to
change
seats
with
her
and
let
her
sit
with
banks
while
that
gentleman
explained
to
her
the
working
of
it
patty
gladly
made
the
change
and
eagerly
listened
while
banks
explained
the
steering
gear
and
as
much
of
the
motor
apparatus
as
he
could
make
clear
to
her
patty
liked
banks
he
was
a
kind
and
courteous
gentleman
and
treated
her
with
a
deference
that
gave
patty
a
sudden
sense
of
importance
it
seemed
strange
to
think
that
she
little
patty
fairfield
was
the
honoured
guest
of
the
banks
of
philadelphia
she
did
her
best
to
be
polite
and
entertaining
in
return
and
the
result
was
very
pleasant
and
also
very
instructive
in
the
art
of
motoring
they
reached
atlantic
city
late
in
the
afternoon
and
went
at
once
to
a
large
hotel
where
banks
had
telegraphed
ahead
for
rooms
patty
and
ethel
had
adjoining
rooms
and
the
allens
and
banks
had
rooms
across
the
hall
from
them
patty
had
begun
to
like
ethel
before
this
trip
had
been
planned
and
as
she
knew
her
better
she
liked
her
more
ethel
banks
though
the
only
daughter
of
a
millionaire
was
not
in
the
least
proud
or
ostentatious
she
was
a
sweet
girl
with
friendly
ways
and
a
good
comradeship
soon
developed
between
her
and
patty
she
was
a
little
older
than
patty
and
had
just
come
out
in
society
during
the
past
winter
as
patty
was
still
a
schoolgirl
she
could
not
be
considered
as
out
but
of
course
on
occasions
like
the
present
such
formalities
made
little
or
no
difference
now
my
dear
said
banks
to
ethel
if
you
and
miss
fairfield
will
hasten
your
toilettes
a
little
we
will
have
time
for
a
ride
on
the
board
walk
before
dinner
this
pleased
the
girls
and
in
a
short
time
they
had
changed
their
travelling
clothes
for
pretty
frocks
and
went
downstairs
to
find
banks
waiting
for
them
on
the
verandah
he
explained
that
the
allens
would
not
go
with
them
on
this
expedition
so
the
three
started
off
as
their
hotel
faced
the
ocean
it
was
just
a
step
to
the
wide
and
beautiful
board
walk
that
runs
for
miles
along
the
beach
at
atlantic
city
in
all
her
life
patty
had
never
seen
such
a
sight
as
this
before
and
the
beauty
and
wonder
of
it
all
nearly
took
her
breath
away
the
board
walk
was
forty
feet
wide
and
was
like
a
moving
picture
of
and
people
although
early
in
april
it
seemed
like
summer
time
so
balmy
was
the
air
so
bright
the
sunshine
patty
gazed
with
delight
at
the
blue
ocean
dotted
with
whitecaps
and
then
back
to
the
wonderful
panorama
of
the
gay
crowd
the
music
of
the
bands
and
the
laughter
of
the
children
the
best
way
to
get
an
idea
of
the
extent
of
this
thing
said
banks
is
to
take
a
ride
in
the
wheeled
chairs
you
two
girls
hop
into
that
double
one
and
i
will
take
this
single
one
and
we
go
along
the
walk
for
a
mile
or
so
the
chairs
were
propelled
by
strong
young
coloured
men
who
were
affable
and
polite
and
who
explained
the
sights
as
they
passed
them
and
pointed
out
places
of
interest
patty
said
to
ethel
that
she
felt
as
if
she
were
in
a
perambulator
except
that
she
was
strapped
in
but
she
soon
became
accustomed
to
the
slow
gentle
motion
of
the
chairs
and
declared
that
it
was
indeed
an
ideal
way
to
see
the
beautiful
place
on
one
side
was
an
endless
row
of
small
shops
or
bazaars
where
wares
of
all
sorts
were
offered
for
sale
at
one
of
these
a
booth
of
oriental
trinkets
banks
stopped
and
bought
each
of
the
girls
a
necklace
of
beads
they
were
not
valuable
ornaments
but
had
a
quaint
foreign
air
and
were
very
pretty
in
their
own
way
patty
was
greatly
pleased
and
when
they
passed
another
booth
which
contained
exquisite
armenian
embroideries
she
begged
ethel
to
accept
the
little
gift
from
her
and
picking
out
some
filmy
handkerchiefs
she
gave
them
to
her
friend
on
they
went
past
the
several
long
piers
until
banks
said
it
was
time
to
turn
around
if
they
would
reach
the
hotel
in
time
for
dinner
so
back
they
went
to
the
hotel
and
after
finding
the
allens
they
all
went
to
the
privately
patty
wondered
how
these
people
could
spend
so
much
time
eating
dinner
when
they
might
be
out
on
the
beach
at
last
to
her
great
satisfaction
dinner
was
over
and
allen
proposed
that
they
all
go
out
for
a
short
stroll
on
the
board
walk
although
it
had
been
a
gay
scene
in
the
afternoon
that
was
as
nothing
to
the
evening
effect
thousands
millions
it
seemed
to
patty
of
electric
lights
in
various
wonderful
devices
and
in
every
possible
colour
made
the
place
as
light
as
day
and
the
varied
gorgeousness
of
the
whole
scene
made
it
seem
as
patty
said
like
a
big
kaleidoscope
they
walked
gaily
along
mingling
with
the
crowd
noticing
various
sights
or
incidents
here
and
there
until
they
reached
the
great
steel
pier
where
allen
invited
them
to
go
with
him
to
the
concert
so
in
they
went
to
listen
to
a
band
concert
this
pleased
patty
for
she
was
especially
fond
of
a
brass
band
but
allen
said
it
was
nothing
short
of
pandemonium
your
tastes
are
barbaric
patty
she
said
laughing
you
love
light
and
colour
and
noise
and
i
do
believe
you
could
have
too
much
of
any
of
the
three
i
do
believe
i
could
said
patty
laughing
herself
as
the
music
banged
and
crashed
and
that
gewgaw
you
got
hanging
around
your
neck
went
on
allen
your
fancy
for
that
proves
you
a
true
barbarian
i
think
it
lovely
said
patty
looking
at
her
beads
i
do
care
if
i
do
like
crazy
things
ethel
likes
these
beads
too
that
all
right
said
allen
of
course
you
like
them
chickadees
and
they
look
very
pretty
with
your
light
frocks
it
no
crime
patty
to
be
barbaric
it
only
means
you
have
youth
and
enthusiasm
and
a
capacity
for
enjoyment
indeed
i
have
said
patty
i
enjoying
all
this
so
much
that
i
feel
as
if
i
should
just
burst
or
fly
away
or
something
do
fly
away
yet
said
ethel
we
ca
spare
you
there
are
lots
more
things
to
see
and
so
there
were
after
the
concert
they
walked
on
and
on
continually
seeing
new
and
interesting
scenes
of
one
sort
or
another
indeed
they
walked
so
far
that
allen
said
they
must
take
chairs
back
so
again
they
got
into
the
rolling
chairs
and
rolled
slowly
back
to
the
hotel
patty
was
thoroughly
tired
out
but
very
happy
and
went
to
sleep
with
the
music
of
the
dashing
surf
sounding
in
her
ears
chapter
iv
lessons
again
but
all
this
fun
and
frolic
soon
came
to
an
end
and
patty
returned
to
new
york
to
take
up
her
studies
again
grandma
elliott
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
pretty
apartment
home
and
welcomed
her
warmly
elliott
and
patty
were
to
stay
at
the
wilberforce
only
about
a
fortnight
longer
then
and
fairfield
were
to
return
and
take
patty
away
with
them
to
the
new
home
on
street
then
the
apartment
in
the
wilberforce
was
to
be
given
up
and
grandma
elliott
would
return
to
vernondale
where
her
son
family
eagerly
awaited
her
i
had
a
perfectly
beautiful
time
grandma
said
patty
as
she
took
off
her
wraps
but
i
have
time
to
tell
you
about
it
now
just
think
school
begins
again
and
i
have
even
looked
at
my
lessons
i
thought
i
would
study
some
in
philadelphia
but
goodness
me
there
a
minute
time
to
do
anything
but
frivol
the
wedding
was
just
gorgeous
nan
was
a
dream
and
papa
looked
like
an
adonis
i
tell
you
more
at
dinner
time
but
now
i
really
must
get
to
work
it
was
already
late
in
the
afternoon
but
patty
brought
out
her
books
and
studied
away
zealously
until
dinner
time
then
making
a
hasty
toilette
she
went
down
to
the
with
grandma
and
during
dinner
gave
the
old
lady
a
more
detailed
account
of
her
visit
after
dinner
lorraine
hamilton
and
the
hart
girls
joined
them
in
the
parlour
but
after
chatting
for
a
few
moments
with
them
patty
declared
she
must
go
back
to
her
studies
it
awfully
hard
she
said
to
lorraine
as
they
walked
to
school
next
morning
to
settle
down
to
work
after
having
such
a
gay
vacation
i
do
believe
lorraine
that
i
never
was
intended
for
a
student
you
doing
too
much
said
lorraine
it
perfectly
silly
of
you
patty
to
try
to
cram
two
years
work
into
one
the
way
you
doing
no
it
is
said
patty
because
then
i
wo
have
to
go
to
school
next
year
and
that
will
be
worth
all
this
hard
work
now
i
awfully
sorry
you
going
away
from
the
wilberforce
said
lorraine
i
shall
miss
you
terribly
i
know
it
and
i
miss
you
too
but
street
is
very
far
away
and
you
must
come
to
see
me
often
the
schoolgirls
all
welcomed
patty
back
for
she
was
a
general
favourite
and
foremost
in
all
the
recreations
and
pleasures
as
well
as
the
classes
of
the
oliphant
school
oh
patty
cried
elise
farrington
as
she
met
her
in
the
cloakroom
what
do
you
think
we
going
to
get
up
a
play
for
commencement
an
original
play
and
act
it
ourselves
and
we
want
you
to
write
it
and
act
in
it
and
it
and
all
will
you
patty
of
course
i
will
said
patty
that
is
i
help
i
wo
write
it
all
alone
nor
act
it
all
by
myself
either
i
do
suppose
it
to
be
a
monologue
is
it
no
said
elise
laughing
we
all
to
be
in
it
and
of
course
all
help
write
it
but
you
must
be
at
the
head
of
it
and
see
that
it
all
goes
on
properly
all
right
said
patty
i
do
all
i
can
but
you
know
i
pretty
busy
this
year
elise
i
know
it
patty
and
you
need
do
much
on
this
thing
just
superintend
and
help
us
out
here
and
there
then
the
girls
went
into
the
class
room
and
the
day
work
began
patty
had
grown
very
fond
of
elise
and
though
some
of
the
other
girls
looked
upon
her
as
rather
haughty
and
what
they
called
patty
failed
to
discern
any
such
traits
in
her
friend
and
though
elise
was
a
daughter
of
a
millionaire
and
lived
a
petted
and
luxurious
life
yet
to
patty
way
of
thinking
she
was
more
sincere
and
simple
in
her
friendship
than
many
of
the
other
girls
after
school
that
day
elise
begged
patty
to
go
home
with
her
and
begin
the
play
ca
do
it
said
patty
i
must
go
home
and
study
oh
just
come
for
a
little
while
the
other
girls
are
coming
and
if
you
help
us
get
the
thing
started
we
can
work
at
it
ourselves
you
know
well
i
go
said
patty
but
i
can
only
stay
a
few
minutes
so
they
all
went
home
with
elise
and
settled
themselves
in
her
attractive
casino
to
compose
their
great
work
but
as
might
be
expected
from
a
group
of
chattering
schoolgirls
they
did
not
progress
very
rapidly
tell
us
all
about
your
fun
in
philadelphia
patty
said
adelaide
hart
and
as
patty
enthusiastically
recounted
the
gaieties
of
her
visit
the
time
slipped
away
until
it
was
five
and
not
a
word
had
been
written
girls
i
must
go
cried
patty
looking
at
her
watch
i
have
an
awful
lot
of
studying
to
do
and
i
really
ought
to
have
come
here
at
all
oh
wait
a
little
longer
pleaded
elise
we
must
get
the
outline
of
this
thing
no
i
ca
said
patty
i
really
ca
but
i
come
saturday
morning
and
will
work
on
it
then
if
you
like
patty
hurried
away
and
when
she
reached
home
she
found
kenneth
harper
waiting
for
her
i
thought
you
never
come
he
said
as
she
arrived
your
school
keeps
very
late
does
it
oh
i
been
visiting
since
school
said
patty
i
ought
to
have
gone
but
i
have
seen
the
girls
for
so
long
and
they
had
a
plan
on
hand
that
they
wanted
to
discuss
with
me
i
have
a
plan
on
hand
too
said
kenneth
i
been
talking
it
over
with
elliott
and
she
has
been
kind
enough
to
agree
to
it
a
crowd
of
us
are
going
to
the
matinée
on
saturday
and
we
want
you
to
go
morse

kindly
consented
to
act
as
chaperon
and
there

about
twelve
in
the
party

cried
patty
indeed
i
will
ken
nothing

keep
me
at
home
wo
it
be
lots
of
fun
yes
it
will
said
kenneth
and
i
so
glad
you
will
go
i
was
afraid
you
say
those
old
lessons
of
yours
were
in
the
way
patty
face
fell
i
ought
to
go
she
said
for
i
promised
the
girls
to
spend
saturday
morning
with
them
and
now
this
plan
of
yours
means
that
i
shall
lose
the
whole
day
and
i
have
so
much
to
do
on
saturday
an
extra
theme
to
write
and
a
lot
of
back
work
to
make
up
oh
ken
i
ought
to
go
oh
come
ahead
you
can
do
those
things
saturday
evening
patty
sighed
she
knew
she
would
feel
much
like
work
saturday
evening
but
she
could
resist
the
temptation
of
the
gay
party
saturday
afternoon
so
she
agreed
to
go
and
kenneth
went
away
much
pleased
what
do
you
think
grandma
said
she
do
you
think
i
ought
to
have
given
up
the
matinée
and
stayed
at
home
to
study
no
indeed
said
grandma
elliott
who
was
an
old
lady
you
enjoy
the
afternoon
with
your
young
friends
and
as
kenneth
says
you
can
study
in
the
evening
so
when
saturday
came
patty
spent
the
morning
with
elise
the
other
girls
were
there
and
they
really
got
to
work
on
their
play
and
planned
the
scenes
and
the
characters
it
will
be
perfectly
lovely
exclaimed
adelaide
hart
i
so
glad
for
our
class
to
do
something
worth
while
it
will
be
a
great
deal
nicer
than
the
tableaux
of
last
year
but
it
will
be
an
awful
lot
of
work
said
hilda
henderson
all
those
costumes
though
they
seem
so
simple
will
be
quite
troublesome
to
get
up
and
the
scenery
will
be
no
joke
perhaps
hepworth
will
help
us
with
the
scenery
said
patty
he
did
once
when
we
had
a
kind
of
a
little
play
in
vernondale
where
i
used
to
live
he
an
artist
you
know
and
he
can
sketch
in
scenes
in
a
minute
and
make
them
look
as
if
they
had
taken
days
to
do
he
awfully
clever
at
it
and
so
kind
that
i
think
he
consent
to
do
it
that
will
be
regularly
splendid
said
elise
and
you
better
ask
him
at
once
patty
so
as
to
give
him
as
much
time
as
possible
no
i
wo
ask
him
quite
yet
said
patty
laughing
i
think
i
wait
until
the
play
is
written
first
i
do
believe
it
customary
to
engage
a
scene
painter
before
a
play
is
scarcely
begun
well
then
let
get
at
it
said
hilda
who
was
practical
so
to
work
they
went
and
really
wrote
the
actual
lines
of
a
good
part
of
the
first
act
now
that
something
like
said
patty
as
when
the
clock
struck
noon
she
looked
with
satisfaction
on
a
dozen
or
more
pages
neatly
written
in
hilda
pretty
penmanship
if
we
keep
on
like
that
we
can
get
this
thing
done
in
five
or
six
saturday
mornings
and
then
i
ask
hepworth
about
the
scenery
then
we
can
begin
to
rehearse
and
we
just
about
be
ready
for
commencement
day
while
patty
was
with
the
girls
her
interest
and
enthusiasm
were
so
great
that
the
play
seemed
the
only
thing
to
be
thought
of
but
when
she
reached
home
and
saw
the
pile
of
untouched
schoolbooks
and
remembered
that
she
would
be
away
all
the
afternoon
she
felt
many
misgivings
however
she
had
promised
to
go
so
off
she
went
to
the
matinée
and
had
a
thoroughly
pleasant
and
enjoyable
time
morse
invited
her
to
go
home
to
dinner
with
clementine
saying
that
she
would
send
her
home
safely
afterward
clementine
added
her
plea
that
this
invitation
might
be
accepted
but
patty
said
no
although
she
wanted
very
much
to
go
with
the
morses
yet
she
knew
that
duty
called
her
home
so
she
regretfully
declined
giving
her
reason
and
went
home
determined
to
work
hard
at
her
themes
and
her
lessons
but
after
her
merry
day
with
her
young
friends
she
was
not
only
tired
physically
but
found
great
difficulty
in
concentrating
her
thoughts
on
more
prosaic
subjects
but
patty
had
pretty
strong
and
she
forced
herself
to
go
at
her
work
in
earnest
grandma
elliott
watched
her
as
she
pored
over
one
book
after
another
or
hastily
scribbled
her
themes
a
little
pucker
formed
itself
between
her
brows
and
a
crimson
flush
appeared
on
her
cheeks
at
ten
elliott
asserted
her
authority
patty
she
said
you
must
go
to
bed
you
make
yourself
ill
if
you
work
so
hard
patty
pushed
back
her
books
i
believe
i
have
to
grandma
she
said
my
head
all
in
a
whirl
and
the
letters
are
dancing
jigs
before
my
eyes
exhausted
patty
crept
into
bed
and
though
she
slept
late
next
morning
grandma
elliott
imagined
that
her
face
still
bore
traces
of
worry
and
hard
work
nonsense
grandma
said
patty
laughing
i
guess
my
robust
constitution
can
stand
a
little
extra
exertion
once
in
a
while
i
try
to
take
it
easier
this
week
and
i
believe
i
give
up
my
gymnasium
work
that
will
give
me
more
time
and
wo
interfere
with
getting
my
diploma
but
though
patty
gained
a
few
extra
half
hours
by
omitting
the
gymnasium
class
she
missed
the
daily
exercise
more
than
she
would
admit
even
to
herself
you
getting
patty
said
lorraine
one
day
and
i
believe
it
because
you
work
so
hard
over
those
old
lessons
it
is
the
work
lorraine
said
patty
laughing
it
the
play
i
had
to
rewrite
the
whole
of
that
garden
scene
last
night
after
i
finished
my
lessons
why
what
was
the
matter
with
it
it
was
all
wrong
we
did
think
of
it
at
the
time
but
in
one
place
elise
has
to
go
off
at
one
side
of
the
stage
and
immediately
after
come
on
at
the
other
side
in
different
dress
now
of
course
that
do
it
has
to
be
arranged
so
that
she
will
have
time
to
change
her
costume
so
i
had
to
write
in
some
lines
for
the
others
and
there
were
several
little
things
like
that
to
be
looked
after
so
i
had
to
do
over
pretty
nearly
the
whole
scene
it
a
shame
patty
we
make
you
do
all
the
hardest
of
the
work
not
a
bit
of
it
i
love
to
do
it
and
when
we
all
work
together
and
chatter
so
of
course
we
do
think
it
out
carefully
enough
and
so
these
mistakes
creep
in
do
say
anything
about
it
lorraine
the
girls
will
never
notice
my
little
changes
and
corrections
and
i
do
want
to
pose
as
a
poor
pale
martyr
growing
in
her
efforts
to
help
her
you
a
brick
patty
but
i
will
tell
them
all
the
same
if
we
all
going
to
write
this
play
together
we
going
to
do
it
all
and
not
have
you
doing
our
work
for
us
lorraine
loyalty
to
patty
was
unbounded
and
as
she
had
moreover
a
trace
of
stubbornness
in
her
character
patty
knew
that
no
amount
of
argument
would
move
her
from
her
determination
to
straighten
matters
out
so
she
gave
up
the
discussion
only
saying
you
wo
do
a
bit
of
good
lorraine
and
anyway
somebody
ought
to
revise
the
thing
and
if
i
do
it
who
will
patty
said
this
without
a
trace
of
egotism
for
she
and
lorraine
both
knew
that
none
of
the
other
girls
had
enough
constructive
talent
or
dramatic
capability
to
put
the
finishing
touches
on
the
lines
of
the
play
that
was
patty
special
forte
just
as
clementine
morse
was
the
one
best
fitted
to
plan
the
scenic
effects
and
elise
farrington
to
design
the
costumes
that
so
said
lorraine
with
a
little
sigh
and
i
suppose
patty
you
just
go
on
in
your
mad
career
and
do
exactly
as
you
please
i
suppose
i
shall
said
patty
laughing
at
lorraine
hopeless
expression
but
i
do
want
this
play
to
be
a
success
and
i
mean
to
help
all
i
can
in
any
way
i
can
it
bound
to
be
a
success
said
lorraine
with
enthusiasm
because
the
girls
are
all
so
interested
and
i
think
we
all
working
hard
in
our
different
ways
of
course
i
do
have
anything
to
do
except
to
look
after
the
incidental
music
but
i
do
hope
that
will
turn
out
all
right
of
course
it
will
lorraine
said
patty
your
selections
are
perfect
so
far
and
you
do
look
after
more
than
that
those
two
little
songs
you
wrote
are
gems
and
they
fit
into
the
second
act
just
exactly
right
i
think
you
a
real
poet
lorraine
and
after
the
play
is
over
i
wish
you
get
those
little
songs
published
i
sure
they
worth
it
i
wish
i
could
said
lorraine
and
i
do
mean
to
try
chapter
v
a
new
home
great
was
the
rejoicing
and
celebration
when
and
fairfield
returned
from
their
wedding
trip
they
came
to
the
apartment
to
remain
there
for
a
few
days
before
moving
to
the
new
house
patty
welcomed
nan
with
open
arms
and
it
was
harder
than
ever
for
her
to
attend
to
her
studies
when
there
was
so
much
going
on
in
the
family
the
furnishing
of
the
new
house
was
almost
completed
but
there
remained
several
finishing
touches
to
be
attended
to
as
patty
time
was
so
much
occupied
she
was
not
allowed
to
have
any
hand
in
this
work
allen
had
come
on
from
philadelphia
to
help
her
daughter
and
grandma
elliott
assisted
in
dismantling
the
apartment
preparatory
to
giving
it
up
so
when
patty
started
to
school
one
friday
morning
and
was
told
that
when
the
session
was
over
she
was
to
go
to
her
new
home
to
stay
she
felt
as
if
she
were
going
to
an
unexplored
country
it
was
with
joyful
anticipations
that
she
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
after
school
and
started
home
her
father
had
given
her
a
and
as
she
stepped
in
at
the
front
door
nan
in
a
pretty
house
dress
stood
ready
to
welcome
her
my
dear
child
she
said
welcome
home
how
do
you
like
the
prospect
it
lovely
said
patty
gazing
around
at
as
much
as
she
could
see
of
the
beautiful
house
and
its
rooms
what
a
lot
of
new
things
there
are
and
i
recognise
a
good
many
of
the
old
ones
too
oh
nan
wo
we
be
happy
all
here
together
indeed
we
will
said
nan
i
think
it
the
loveliest
house
in
the
world
and
mother
and
fred
have
fixed
it
up
so
prettily
come
up
and
see
your
room
patty
a
large
pleasant
front
room
on
the
third
floor
had
been
assigned
to
patty
use
and
all
her
own
special
and
favourite
belongings
had
been
placed
there
how
dear
of
you
nan
to
arrange
this
all
for
me
and
put
it
all
to
rights
i
really
could
have
taken
the
time
to
do
it
myself
but
just
the
way
i
want
it
and
this
said
nan
opening
a
door
into
a
small
room
adjoining
is
your
own
little
study
where
you
can
be
quiet
and
undisturbed
while
you
studying
those
terrific
lessons
of
yours
patty
gave
a
little
squeal
of
delight
at
the
dainty
library
furnished
in
green
and
with
her
own
desk
and
bookcases
already
in
place
but
do
think
nan
went
on
that
we
shall
let
you
stay
here
and
grub
away
at
those
books
much
of
the
time
an
hour
a
day
is
all
we
intend
to
allow
you
to
be
absent
from
our
family
circle
while
you
in
the
house
an
hour
a
day
to
study
exclaimed
patty
it
more
likely
that
an
hour
a
day
is
all
i
can
give
you
of
my
valuable
society
we
see
about
that
said
nan
wagging
her
head
wisely
you
see
i
have
some
authority
now
and
i
intend
to
exercise
it
ha
said
patty
dramatically
i
see
it
will
be
war
to
the
knife
to
the
knife
declared
nan
as
she
ran
away
laughing
patty
looked
about
her
two
lovely
rooms
with
genuine
pleasure
she
was
like
a
cat
in
her
love
of
comfortable
chairs
and
luxurious
cushions
and
she
fully
appreciated
the
special
and
individual
care
with
which
nan
and
her
father
had
considered
her
tastes
had
she
not
been
so
busy
she
would
have
preferred
to
have
a
hand
in
the
arranging
of
her
rooms
herself
but
as
it
was
she
was
thankful
that
someone
else
had
done
it
for
her
hastily
throwing
off
her
hat
and
coat
she
flung
herself
into
a
comfortable
easy
chair
by
her
library
table
and
was
soon
deep
in
her
french
lesson
a
couple
of
hours
later
nan
came
up
and
found
her
there
patty
fairfield
she
exclaimed
you
are
the
worst
i
ever
saw
get
right
up
and
dress
for
dinner
your
father
will
be
home
in
a
few
minutes
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
receive
properly
the
master
of
the
house
patty
rubbed
her
eyes
and
blinked
as
nan
pulled
the
book
away
from
her
and
said
why
what
time
is
it
time
for
you
to
stop
studying
and
come
out
of
your
shell
and
mingle
with
the
world
wake
up
and
nan
gave
patty
a
little
shake
patty
came
to
herself
and
jumped
up
saying
indeed
i
glad
enough
to
leave
my
horrid
books
and
i
hungry
enough
to
eat
any
dinner
you
may
set
before
me
what
shall
i
wear
nan
put
on
that
pretty
light
blue
thing
of
yours
with
the
lace
yoke
this
is
rather
a
festival
night
and
we
going
to
celebrate
the
first
dinner
in
our
new
home
so
patty
brushed
her
curly
hair
and
tied
on
a
white
ribbon
bow
of
such
exceeding
size
and
freshness
that
she
looked
almost
as
if
wings
were
sprouting
from
her
shoulders
then
she
donned
her
light
blue
frock
and
went
dancing
downstairs
to
find
that
her
father
had
already
arrived
well
pattikins
he
said
can
you
feel
at
home
in
this
big
house
after
living
so
long
in
our
apartment
yes
indeed
said
patty
any
place
is
home
where
you
and
nan
are
the
dinner
passed
off
gaily
enough
only
the
three
were
present
as
nan
did
not
want
any
guests
the
first
night
although
the
appointments
were
those
that
had
furnished
the
home
yet
they
were
so
augmented
by
numerous
wedding
gifts
of
nan
that
patty
felt
as
if
she
were
at
a
dinner
party
of
unusual
splendour
it
lovely
to
live
in
a
house
with
a
bride
she
said
because
there
are
such
beautiful
silver
and
glass
things
on
the
table
and
on
the
sideboard
yes
said
nan
glancing
around
her
with
satisfaction
i
intend
to
use
all
my
things
i
think
it
perfectly
silly
to
pack
them
away
in
a
safe
and
never
have
any
good
of
them
but
suppose
burglars
break
in
and
steal
them
said
patty
well
even
so
said
nan
placidly
they
would
be
gone
but
it
be
much
different
from
having
them
stored
away
in
a
safe
deposit
company
nan
principle
is
right
said
fairfield
now
here
the
way
i
look
at
it
what
you
ca
afford
to
lose
you
ca
afford
to
buy
remember
that
patty
and
if
ever
you
are
tempted
to
invest
a
large
sum
of
money
in
a
diamond
or
silver
or
any
portable
property
look
upon
that
money
as
gone
forever
true
you
might
realise
on
your
possession
in
case
of
need
but
more
likely
you
could
not
and
too
there
is
always
the
chance
of
losing
it
by
carelessness
or
theft
so
remember
that
you
afford
to
buy
what
you
ca
afford
to
lose
that
a
new
idea
to
me
papa
said
patty
but
i
see
what
you
mean
and
i
know
you
are
right
however
there
little
chance
of
my
investing
in
silver
at
present
for
i
can
just
as
well
use
nan
of
course
you
can
said
nan
heartily
and
whenever
you
want
to
have
company
or
a
party
of
any
kind
you
only
to
mention
it
and
not
only
my
silver
but
my
servants
and
my
own
best
efforts
are
at
your
disposal
that
lovely
said
patty
and
i
would
love
to
have
parties
and
invite
the
schoolgirls
and
some
of
the
boys
but
i
ca
take
the
time
now
why
i
could
spare
an
evening
from
my
studies
to
entertain
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
nonsense
said
fairfield
you
must
work
so
hard
puss
and
anyway
you
have
to
spare
this
evening
for
i
asked
hepworth
to
drop
in
and
i
think
two
or
three
others
may
come
and
we
have
a
little
informal
housewarming
yes
said
patty
dubiously
and
kenneth
said
he
would
call
this
evening
and
elise
and
roger
may
come
in
so
as
it
friday
evening
i
see
them
of
course
but
after
this
i
must
study
every
evening
except
fridays
a
little
later
on
when
a
number
of
guests
had
assembled
in
the
fairfields
patty
looked
like
anything
but
a
bookworm
or
a
student
her
eyes
danced
and
the
colour
glowed
in
her
pretty
face
for
she
was
very
fond
of
merry
society
and
always
looked
her
prettiest
when
thus
animated
she
and
elise
entertained
the
others
by
quoting
some
bits
from
the
school
play
nan
sang
for
them
and
kenneth
gave
some
of
his
clever
and
funny
impersonations
hepworth
declared
that
he
had
no
parlour
tricks
but
patty
asserted
that
he
had
and
she
ran
laughing
from
the
room
to
return
with
several
large
sheets
of
paper
and
a
stick
of
drawing
charcoal
then
she
decreed
that
hepworth
should
draw
caricature
portraits
of
all
those
present
after
a
little
demurring
the
artist
consented
and
shrieks
of
laughter
arose
as
his
clever
pencil
swiftly
sketched
a
humorous
portrait
of
each
one
it
right
down
jolly
said
kenneth
to
patty
your
having
a
big
house
of
your
own
like
this
may
i
come
often
to
see
you
nan
is
so
kind
she
always
has
a
welcome
for
me
you
may
come
and
accept
her
welcome
whenever
you
like
said
patty
but
i
ca
promise
to
see
you
ken
except
friday
evenings
honestly
i
do
have
one
minute
to
myself
you
see
we
rehearse
the
play
afternoons
and
evenings
i
have
to
study
and
saturday
is
crammed
jam
full
but
she
will
see
you
kenneth
said
nan
who
had
heard
these
remarks
we
not
going
to
let
her
retire
from
the
world
in
any
such
fashion
as
she
proposes
so
you
come
to
see
us
whenever
you
like
and
my
word
for
it
patty
will
be
at
home
to
you
nan
passed
on
laughing
and
patty
turned
to
kenneth
with
an
appealing
glance
you
know
how
it
is
do
you
ken
i
just
have
to
stick
to
my
work
like
everything
or
i
wo
pass
those
fearful
examinations
and
now
that
made
up
my
mind
to
try
for
them
i
want
to
succeed
yes
i
know
patty
and
i
fully
sympathise
with
your
ambitions
stick
to
it
and
you
come
out
all
right
yet
and
if
i
should
call
sometimes
when
you
studying
just
say
you
too
busy
to
see
me
and
it
will
be
all
right
what
an
old
trump
you
are
ken
you
always
seem
to
understand
but
as
the
days
passed
on
patty
found
that
other
people
did
not
understand
her
study
hours
were
continually
interrupted
there
were
occasional
callers
in
the
afternoon
and
when
nan
presented
herself
at
the
study
door
and
begged
so
prettily
that
patty
would
come
down
just
this
once
the
girl
had
the
heart
to
refuse
then
there
was
often
company
in
the
evenings
and
again
patty
would
be
forced
to
break
through
her
rules
or
there
were
temptations
which
she
really
resist
such
as
when
her
father
came
home
to
dinner
bringing
tickets
for
the
opera
or
for
some
especially
fine
play
then
nan
had
a
day
each
week
on
which
she
received
her
friends
and
on
these
thursdays
patty
was
supposed
also
to
act
as
hostess
of
course
this
pleasant
duty
was
imperative
and
patty
always
enjoyed
the
little
receptions
though
she
felt
guilty
at
losing
her
thursday
afternoons
almost
invariably
too
some
of
the
guests
accepted
nan
invitation
to
remain
to
dinner
and
that
counted
out
thursday
evening
as
well
altogether
poor
patty
was
at
her
wits
end
to
find
any
time
to
herself
she
tried
rising
very
early
in
the
morning
and
studying
before
breakfast
but
she
found
it
difficult
to
awaken
early
and
neither
nan
nor
her
father
would
allow
her
to
be
called
so
she
was
forced
to
resort
to
sitting
up
late
and
studying
after
the
rest
of
the
household
had
retired
as
her
room
was
on
the
third
floor
she
had
no
difficulty
in
pursuing
this
plan
without
anyone
being
aware
of
it
but
burning
the
midnight
oil
soon
began
to
tell
on
her
appearance
one
morning
at
breakfast
her
father
said
patty
child
what
is
the
matter
with
you
your
eyes
look
like
two
holes
burnt
in
a
blanket
you
were
up
late
last
night
not
very
said
patty
dropping
her
eyes
before
her
father
searching
gaze
nothing
more
was
said
on
the
subject
but
though
patty
hated
to
do
anything
secretly
yet
she
felt
she
must
continue
her
night
work
as
it
was
really
her
only
chance
so
that
night
as
she
sat
studying
until
nearly
midnight
her
door
slowly
opened
and
nan
peeped
in
she
wore
a
kimono
and
her
hair
was
in
a
long
braid
down
her
back
patty
fairfield
she
said
go
to
bed
at
once
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
to
sit
up
so
late
when
you
know
your
father
does
want
you
to
now
look
here
nan
said
patty
talking
very
seriously
i
to
sit
up
late
like
this
because
i
ca
get
a
minute
time
through
the
day
you
know
how
it
is
there
always
company
or
something
going
on
and
i
ca
wake
up
early
in
the
morning
and
i
have
to
sit
up
late
at
night
even
if
it
does
make
me
tired
and
sleepy
and
good
for
nothing
the
next
day
oh
nan
instead
of
hindering
and
making
fun
of
me
and
bothering
me
all
you
can
i
think
you
might
try
to
help
me
patty
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
burying
her
face
in
nan
lap
burst
into
a
convulsive
flood
of
tears
nan
was
thoroughly
frightened
she
had
never
before
seen
patty
cry
and
this
was
more
than
crying
it
was
almost
hysterical
then
like
a
flash
nan
saw
it
all
overwork
and
worry
had
so
wrought
on
patty
nerves
that
the
girl
was
half
sick
and
wholly
irresponsible
for
her
actions
with
a
ready
tact
nan
patted
the
golden
head
and
gently
soothed
the
excited
child
never
mind
patty
darling
she
said
and
try
to
forgive
me
you
i
fear
i
have
been
rather
blind
to
the
true
state
of
the
case
but
i
see
more
plainly
now
and
i
will
help
you
indeed
i
will
i
will
see
to
it
that
you
shall
have
your
hours
for
study
just
as
you
want
them
and
you
shall
not
be
interrupted
dear
little
girl
you
all
tired
out
and
your
nerves
are
all
on
edge
and
no
wonder
now
hop
along
to
bed
and
you
see
that
things
will
go
better
after
this
as
she
talked
nan
had
gently
soothed
the
excited
girl
and
in
a
quiet
way
she
helped
her
prepare
for
bed
and
finally
tucked
her
up
snugly
under
her
down
coverlet
dearie
she
said
go
to
sleep
without
a
bother
on
your
mind
and
remember
that
after
this
nan
will
see
to
it
that
you
shall
have
other
times
to
study
than
the
middle
of
the
night
said
patty
and
i
sorry
i
made
such
a
baby
of
myself
but
truly
nan
i
bothered
to
death
with
those
old
lessons
and
the
play
and
everything
that
all
right
just
go
to
sleep
and
dream
of
commencement
day
when
all
the
bothers
will
be
over
and
you
get
your
diploma
and
your
medal
and
a
few
dozen
bouquets
besides
and
with
a
final
kiss
nan
left
the
girl
and
returned
thoughtfully
to
her
own
room
chapter
vi
busy
days
nan
was
as
good
as
her
word
instead
of
trying
to
persuade
patty
not
to
study
so
hard
she
did
all
she
could
to
keep
the
study
hours
free
from
interruption
many
a
time
when
nan
wanted
patty
company
or
assistance
she
refrained
from
telling
her
so
and
unselfishly
left
the
girl
to
herself
as
much
as
possible
the
result
of
this
was
that
patty
gave
herself
up
to
her
books
and
her
school
work
to
such
an
extent
that
she
allowed
herself
almost
no
social
recreation
and
took
little
or
no
exercise
beyond
her
walks
to
and
from
school
this
went
on
for
a
time
but
patty
was
after
all
of
a
sensitive
and
observing
nature
and
she
soon
discovered
by
a
certain
wistful
expression
on
nan
face
or
a
tone
of
regret
in
her
voice
that
she
was
often
sacrificing
her
own
convenience
to
patty
patty
sense
of
proportion
rebelled
at
this
and
she
felt
that
she
must
be
more
obliging
to
nan
who
was
so
truly
kind
to
her
and
so
she
endeavoured
to
cram
more
duties
into
her
already
full
days
and
often
after
a
hard
day
work
in
school
when
she
would
have
been
glad
to
throw
on
a
comfortable
house
gown
and
rest
in
her
own
room
she
dressed
herself
prettily
and
went
out
calling
with
her
stepmother
or
assisted
her
to
receive
her
own
guests
nan
was
not
acutely
observant
and
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
all
this
meant
any
on
patty
part
she
accepted
with
pleasure
each
occasion
when
patty
plans
fell
in
with
her
own
and
the
more
this
was
the
case
the
more
she
expected
it
so
that
poor
patty
again
found
herself
bewildered
by
her
multitude
of
conflicting
duties
i
have
heard
she
thought
to
herself
one
day
that
duties
never
clash
but
it
seems
to
me
they
never
do
anything
else
now
this
afternoon
sure
it
my
duty
to
write
my
theme
and
yet
i
promised
the
girls
i
be
at
rehearsal
and
then
nan
is
so
anxious
for
me
to
go
shopping
with
her
that
i
honestly
do
know
which
i
ought
to
do
but
i
believe
i
write
my
theme
because
that
does
seem
the
most
important
patty
called
nan
voice
from
the
hall
you
go
with
me
this
afternoon
wo
you
i
have
to
decide
between
those
two
hats
you
know
and
truly
i
ca
take
the
responsibility
alone
oh
nan
said
patty
it
really
does
matter
which
hat
you
get
they
both
so
lovely
i
seen
them
you
know
and
truly
i
think
one
is
just
as
becoming
as
the
other
and
honest
i
fearfully
busy
oh
pshaw
patty
i
let
you
alone
afternoons
for
almost
a
week
now
or
at
least
for
two
or
three
days
anyhow
i
think
you
might
go
with
me
patty
always
found
it
hard
to
resist
coaxing
so
with
a
little
sigh
she
consented
and
gave
up
her
whole
afternoon
to
nan
that
meant
sitting
up
late
at
night
to
study
but
this
was
now
getting
to
be
the
rule
with
patty
and
not
the
exception
so
the
weeks
flew
by
and
as
commencement
day
drew
nearer
patty
worked
harder
and
her
nerves
grew
more
strained
and
tense
until
a
breakdown
of
some
sort
seemed
imminent
fairfield
at
last
awoke
to
the
situation
and
told
patty
that
she
was
growing
thin
and
pale
and
never
mind
said
patty
looking
at
her
father
with
an
abstracted
air
i
have
time
now
papa
even
to
discuss
the
subject
commencement
day
is
next
week
my
examinations
begin
and
i
have
full
charge
of
the
costumes
for
the
play
and
they
not
nearly
ready
yet
you
must
work
so
hard
patty
said
nan
in
her
futile
way
nan
if
you
say
that
to
me
again
i
throw
something
at
you
i
give
you
fair
warning
people
that
i
so
bothered
and
worried
that
my
nerves
are
all
on
edge
and
my
temper
is
pretty
much
the
same
way
now
until
after
commencement
i
got
to
work
hard
but
if
i
just
live
through
that
i
be
sweet
and
amiable
again
and
will
do
anything
you
want
me
to
patty
was
half
laughing
but
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
she
was
very
much
in
earnest
commencement
was
to
occur
the
first
week
in
june
and
the
examinations
which
took
place
the
week
before
were
like
a
nightmare
to
poor
patty
had
she
been
free
to
give
her
undivided
attention
she
might
have
taken
them
more
calmly
but
her
mind
was
so
full
of
the
troubles
and
responsibilities
consequent
on
the
play
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
concentrate
her
thoughts
on
the
examination
work
and
yet
the
examinations
were
of
far
more
importance
than
the
play
for
patty
was
most
anxious
to
graduate
with
honours
and
she
felt
sure
that
she
knew
thoroughly
the
ground
she
had
been
over
in
her
studies
at
last
examinations
were
finished
and
though
not
yet
informed
of
her
markings
patty
felt
that
on
the
whole
she
had
been
fairly
successful
and
friday
night
she
went
home
from
school
with
a
heart
lighter
than
it
had
been
for
many
weeks
thank
goodness
it
over
she
cried
as
she
entered
the
house
and
clasping
nan
around
the
waist
she
waltzed
her
down
the
hall
in
a
mad
joy
of
celebration
well
i
am
glad
said
nan
after
she
had
recovered
her
breath
now
you
can
rest
and
get
back
your
rosy
cheeks
once
more
not
yet
said
patty
gaily
there
is
commencement
day
and
the
play
yet
they
fun
compared
to
examinations
but
still
they
mean
a
tremendous
lot
of
work
will
be
my
busiest
day
yet
and
i
bought
me
an
alarm
clock
because
i
have
to
get
up
at
five
in
order
to
get
through
the
day
at
all
what
nonsense
said
nan
but
patty
only
laughed
and
scurried
away
to
dress
for
dinner
when
the
new
alarm
clock
went
off
at
five
the
next
morning
patty
awoke
with
a
start
wondering
what
in
the
world
had
happened
then
as
she
slowly
came
to
her
senses
she
rubbed
her
sleepy
eyes
jumped
up
quickly
and
began
to
dress
by
breakfast
time
she
had
accomplished
wonders
i
rewritten
two
songs
she
announced
at
the
breakfast
table
and
sewed
for
an
hour
on
hilda
fairy
costume
and
cut
out
a
thousand
gilt
stars
for
the
scenery
and
made
two
hundred
paper
violets
besides
you
are
a
wonder
patty
said
nan
but
fairfield
looked
at
his
daughter
anxiously
her
eyes
were
shining
with
excitement
and
there
was
a
little
red
spot
on
either
cheek
be
careful
dear
he
said
it
would
be
pretty
bad
if
after
getting
through
your
examinations
you
should
break
down
because
of
this
foolish
play
it
is
a
foolish
play
papa
said
patty
gaily
it
most
wise
and
sensible
i
ought
to
know
for
i
wrote
most
of
it
myself
and
planned
all
the
costumes
and
helped
to
make
many
of
them
one
or
two
though
we
have
to
get
from
a
regular
costumer
and
i
have
to
go
and
see
about
them
want
to
go
with
me
nan
i
love
to
go
said
nan
but
i
have
a
minute
to
spare
all
day
long
i
going
to
the
photographer
and
then
to
luncheon
and
after
that
to
a
musicale
never

said
patty
it
wo
be
much
fun
i
just
have
to
pick
out
the
costumes
for
joan
of
arc
and
queen
elizabeth
your
play
seems
to
include
a
variety
of
characters
said
fairfield
yes
it
does
said
patty
and
most
of
the
dresses
we
contrived
ourselves
but
these
two
are
beyond
us
so
we
going
to
hire
them
now
people
i
must
fly
over
to
see
elise
before
i
go
down
town
who
going
with
you
patty
to
the
costumer
asked
her
father
miss
sinclair
papa
one
of
the
teachers
in
our
school
i
am
to
meet
her
at
the
school
at
eleven
we
are
going
to
the
costume
place
and
then
to
the
shops
to
buy
a
few
things
for
the
play
i
be
home
to
luncheon
nan
at
one
patty
flew
away
on
her
numerous
errands
going
first
to
elise
farrington
to
consult
on
some
important
matters
hilda
and
clementine
were
there
and
there
was
so
much
to
be
decided
that
the
time
passed
by
unnoticed
until
patty
exclaimed
why
girls
it
eleven
now
and
i
was
to
meet
miss
sinclair
at
eleven
oh
i
so
sorry
i
make
it
a
point
never
to
keep
anybody
waiting
i
do
know
when
i
ever
missed
an
engagement
before
now
you
must
finish
up
about
the
programmes
and
things
and
i
scurry
right
along
she
must
be
there
waiting
for
me
the
school
was
only
two
blocks
away
and
patty
covered
the
ground
as
rapidly
as
possible
but
when
she
reached
there
miss
sinclair
had
gone
another
teacher
who
was
there
told
patty
that
miss
sinclair
had
waited
until
twenty
minutes
after
eleven
and
then
she
had
concluded
that
she
must
have
mistaken
the
appointment
and
that
probably
patty
had
meant
she
would
meet
her
at
the
costumer
so
she
had
gone
on
leaving
word
for
patty
to
follow
her
there
if
by
any
chance
she
should
come
to
the
school
looking
for
her
patty
did
know
what
to
do
the
costumer
shop
was
a
considerable
distance
away
and
patty
was
not
in
the
habit
of
going
around
the
city
alone
but
this
seemed
to
her
a
special
occasion
and
too
there
was
no
time
to
hesitate
she
thought
of
telephoning
to
nan
but
of
course
she
had
already
gone
out
she
could
call
her
father
up
from
down
town
and
it
would
help
matters
any
to
ask
elise
or
any
of
the
other
girls
to
go
with
her
so
having
to
make
a
hasty
decision
patty
determined
to
go
alone
she
knew
the
address
and
though
she
did
know
exactly
how
to
reach
it
she
felt
sure
she
could
learn
by
a
few
enquiries
but
after
leaving
the
broadway
car
she
discovered
that
she
had
to
travel
quite
a
distance
east
and
there
was
no
line
in
that
locality
regretting
the
necessity
of
keeping
miss
sinclair
waiting
patty
hurried
on
and
after
some
difficulty
reached
the
place
only
to
find
that
the
costumer
had
recently
moved
and
that
his
new
address
was
some
distance
farther
up
town
patty
did
not
at
all
like
the
situation
she
was
unfamiliar
with
this
part
of
the
town
she
felt
awkward
and
embarrassed
at
being
there
alone
and
she
was
extremely
sorry
not
to
have
kept
her
engagement
with
miss
sinclair
all
of
this
added
to
the
fact
that
she
was
nervous
and
overwrought
as
well
as
physically
tired
out
rendered
her
unable
to
use
her
really
good
judgment
and
common
sense
she
stood
on
a
street
corner
uncertain
what
to
do
next
and
her
uncertainty
was
distinctly
manifest
on
her
countenance
the
driver
of
a
passing
hansom
called
out
cab
miss
and
this
seemed
to
patty
a
providential
solution
of
her
difficulty
recklessly
unheeding
the
fact
that
she
had
never
before
been
in
a
public
cab
alone
she
jumped
in
after
giving
the
costumer
number
to
the
driver
as
she
rode
up
town
she
thought
it
over
and
concluded
that
after
all
she
had
acted
wisely
and
that
she
could
explain
to
her
father
how
the
emergency
had
really
necessitated
this
unusual
proceeding
it
was
a
long
ride
and
when
patty
jumped
out
of
the
cab
and
asked
the
driver
his
price
she
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
large
sum
he
mentioned
however
she
thought
it
was
wiser
to
pay
it
without
protest
than
to
make
herself
further
conspicuous
by
discussing
the
matter
she
opened
the
little
which
she
carried
only
to
make
the
startling
discovery
that
her
purse
was
missing
even
as
she
realised
this
there
flashed
across
her
memory
the
fact
that
her
father
had
often
told
her
that
it
was
a
careless
way
to
carry
money
and
that
she
would
sooner
or
later
be
relieved
of
her
purse
by
some
clever
pickpocket
patty
could
not
be
sure
whether
this
was
what
had
happened
in
the
present
instance
or
whether
she
had
left
her
purse
at
home
as
she
had
carried
change
for
carfare
in
her
coat
pocket
she
had
not
expected
to
need
a
large
sum
of
money
and
her
confused
brain
refused
to
remember
whether
she
had
put
her
purse
in
her
bag
or
not
she
found
herself
staring
at
the
cabman
who
was
looking
distrustfully
at
her
i
think
i
have
had
my
pocket
picked
she
said
slowly
or
else
i
left
my
purse
at
home
i
do
know
which
no
no
miss
that
wo
go
down
said
the
cabman
not
rudely
but
with
an
uncomfortable
effect
of
being
determined
to
have
his
fare
pay
up
now
pay
up
he
went
on
and
you
save
yourself
trouble
in
the
end
but
i
ca
pay
you
said
patty
i
have
any
money
then
you
did
ought
to
ride
it
ai
the
first
time
i
knowed
a
swell
young
lady
to
try
to
beat
her
way
come
miss
if
you
do
pay
me
i
have
to
drive
you
to
the
station
house
what
cried
patty
her
face
turning
white
with
anger
and
mortification
yes
miss
that
the
way
we
do
i
you
know
you
stole
a
ride
oh
wait
a
minute
said
patty
let
me
think
think
away
miss
perhaps
you
can
remember
where
you
hid
your
money
but
i
tell
you
i
have
any
said
patty
her
indignation
rising
above
her
fear
now
look
here
i
have
a
friend
right
in
here
at
this
address
let
me
speak
to
her
and
she
come
out
and
pay
you
no
no
miss
you
ca
ketch
me
that
way
i
heard
of
them
friends
before
but
i
tell
you
what
he
added
as
patty
stood
looking
at
him
blankly
i
go
in
there
with
you
and
if
so
be
your
friend
there
and
pays
up
the
cash
i
nothing
more
to
say
the
climbed
down
from
his
seat
and
went
with
patty
into
the
costumer
shop
a
woman
of
italian
type
met
them
and
enquired
what
was
wanted
is
miss
sinclair
here
asked
patty
eagerly
no
miss
there
nobody
here
by
way
of
a
customer
but
has
a
lady
been
here
in
the
last
hour
to
look
at
costumes
for
a
play
no
miss
nobody
been
here
this
whole
morning
you
see
you
ca
work
that
game
said
the
cabman
i
sorry
miss
but
i
guess
you
have
to
come
along
with
me
chapter
vii
a
rescue
perhaps
it
was
partly
owing
to
patty
natural
sense
of
humour
or
perhaps
her
overwrought
nerves
made
her
feel
a
little
hysterically
inclined
but
somehow
the
situation
suddenly
struck
her
as
being
very
funny
to
think
that
she
patty
fairfield
was
about
to
be
arrested
because
she
could
pay
her
cab
fare
truly
seemed
like
a
joke
but
though
it
seemed
like
a
joke
it
was
one
as
patty
hesitated
the
cabman
grew
more
impatient
and
less
respectful
patty
feeling
of
amusement
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
and
she
realised
that
she
must
do
something
at
once
nan
was
not
at
home
her
father
was
too
far
away
and
curiously
the
next
person
she
thought
of
as
one
who
could
help
her
in
her
trouble
was
hepworth
this
thought
seemed
like
an
inspiration
instantly
assuming
an
air
of
authority
and
dignity
she
turned
to
the
angry
cabman
and
said
you
will
be
the
one
to
be
arrested
unless
you
behave
yourself
more
properly
come
with
me
to
the
nearest
public
telephone
station
i
have
sufficient
money
with
me
to
pay
for
a
telephone
message
and
i
will
then
prove
to
your
satisfaction
that
your
fare
will
be
immediately
paid
patty
afterward
wondered
how
she
had
the
courage
to
make
this
speech
but
the
fear
of
what
might
happen
had
been
such
a
shock
to
her
that
it
had
reacted
upon
her
timidity
and
with
good
results
for
the
cabman
at
once
became
meek
and
even
cringing
there
a
telephone
across
the
street
miss
he
said
very
well
said
patty
come
with
me
there
a
telephone
here
miss
said
the
italian
woman
if
you
would
like
to
use
it
that
better
yet
said
patty
where
the
book
taking
the
telephone
book
patty
quickly
turned
the
leaves
until
she
found
hepworth
studio
number
she
had
an
aversion
to
speaking
her
own
name
before
her
present
hearers
so
when
hepworth
responded
she
merely
said
do
you
know
who
i
am
of
course
the
others
listening
could
not
hear
when
hepworth
responded
that
he
did
know
her
voice
and
then
called
her
by
name
very
well
said
patty
still
speaking
with
dignity
i
have
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
my
purse
and
i
am
unable
to
pay
my
cab
fare
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
answer
the
cabman
over
this
telephone
right
now
and
inform
him
that
it
will
be
paid
if
he
will
drive
me
to
your
address
which
you
will
give
him
certainly
replied
hepworth
politely
though
he
was
really
very
much
amazed
at
this
message
patty
turned
to
the
cabman
and
said
somewhat
sternly
take
this
receiver
and
speak
to
the
gentleman
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
sheepishly
the
man
took
the
receiver
and
timidly
remarked
hello
what
is
your
number
asked
hepworth
and
the
cabman
told
him
where
are
you
was
the
next
question
and
the
cabman
gave
the
address
of
the
costumer
which
patty
had
not
remembered
to
do
hepworth
studio
was
not
very
many
blocks
away
and
he
gave
the
cabman
his
name
and
address
saying
bring
the
young
lady
around
here
at
once
as
quickly
as
you
can
i
will
settle
with
you
on
your
arrival
hepworth
hung
up
his
own
receiver
much
puzzled
his
first
impulse
was
to
go
to
the
address
where
patty
was
but
as
it
would
take
some
time
for
him
to
get
around
there
by
any
means
he
deemed
it
better
that
she
should
come
to
him
as
patty
felt
safe
now
that
she
was
so
soon
to
meet
hepworth
she
gave
her
remaining
change
to
the
italian
woman
who
had
been
kind
though
stolidly
disinterested
during
the
whole
interview
the
cabman
having
given
his
number
to
hepworth
felt
a
responsibility
for
the
safety
of
his
passenger
and
assisted
her
into
the
cab
with
humble
politeness
a
few
moments
ride
brought
them
to
the
large
building
in
which
was
hepworth
studio
and
that
gentleman
himself
hatted
and
gloved
stood
on
the
curb
awaiting
them
what
it
all
about
he
asked
patty
making
no
motion
however
to
assist
her
from
the
cab
but
the
reaction
after
her
fright
and
embarrassment
had
made
patty
so
weak
and
nervous
that
she
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
i
did
have
any
money
she
said
i
do
know
whether
i
lost
it
or
not
and
if
you
please
pay
him
papa
will
pay
you
afterward
of
course
child
that
all
right
said
hepworth
do
get
out
he
added
as
patty
started
to
do
so
stay
right
where
you
are
and
take
you
home
he
gave
patty
address
to
the
driver
swung
himself
into
the
cab
beside
patty
and
off
they
started
i
was
frightened
said
patty
though
her
quivering
lip
and
trembling
hands
belied
her
words
but
when
he
said
he
arrest
me
i
i
know
what
to
do
and
so
i
telephoned
to
you
quite
right
said
hepworth
in
a
casual
tone
which
gave
no
hint
of
the
joy
he
felt
in
being
patty
protector
in
such
an
emergency
but
i
say
child
you
look
regularly
done
up
what
have
you
been
doing
have
you
had
your
luncheon
no
said
patty
faintly
and
it
after
two
said
hepworth
sympathetically
you
poor
infant
i
like
to
take
you
somewhere
for
a
bite
but
i
suppose
that
would
do
well
here
the
only
thing
we
can
do
and
it
will
at
least
keep
you
from
fainting
away
he
signalled
the
cabman
to
stop
at
a
drug
shop
where
there
was
a
large
soda
fountain
here
he
ordered
for
patty
a
cup
of
hot
bouillon
he
made
her
drink
it
slowly
and
was
rejoiced
to
see
that
it
did
her
good
she
felt
better
at
once
and
when
they
returned
to
the
cab
she
begged
hepworth
to
let
her
go
on
home
alone
and
not
take
any
more
of
his
valuable
time
no
indeed
said
that
gentleman
it
may
not
be
according
to
the
strictest
rules
of
etiquette
for
me
to
be
going
around
with
you
in
a
hansom
cab
but
it
infinitely
better
than
for
you
to
be
going
around
alone
so
i
just
take
charge
of
you
until
i
can
put
you
safely
inside
your
father
house
and
the
girls
are
coming
at
two
for
a
rehearsal
said
patty
oh
i
shall
be
late
the
girls
will
wait
said
hepworth
easily
and
then
during
the
rest
of
the
ride
he
entertained
patty
with
light
merry
conversation
he
watched
her
closely
however
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
girl
was
very
nervous
and
excitable
to
a
degree
that
made
him
fear
she
was
on
the
verge
of
a
mental
illness
when
is
this
play
of
yours
to
come
off
he
enquired
next
thursday
night
said
patty
if
we
can
get
ready
for
it
and
we
must
but
oh
there
is
so
much
to
do
and
now
i
wasted
this
whole
morning
and
have
accomplished
a
thing
and
i
do
know
where
miss
sinclair
is
and
i
did
see
about
the
costumes
after
all
and
now
be
late
for
rehearsal
oh
what
shall
i
do
hepworth
had
sufficient
intuition
to
know
that
if
he
sympathised
with
patty
in
her
troubles
she
was
ready
to
break
down
in
a
fit
of
nervous
crying
so
he
said
as
if
the
matter
were
of
no
moment
oh
pshaw
those
costumes
will
get
themselves
attended
to
some
way
or
another
why
go
down
there
this
afternoon
and
hunt
them
up
if
you
like
just
tell
me
what
ones
you
want
this
was
help
indeed
patty
well
knew
that
hepworth
artistic
taste
could
select
the
costumes
even
better
than
her
own
and
she
eagerly
told
him
the
necessary
details
hepworth
also
promised
to
look
after
some
other
errands
that
were
troubling
patty
mind
so
that
when
she
finally
reached
home
she
was
calm
and
once
more
hepworth
quickly
settled
matters
with
the
cabman
and
then
escorted
patty
up
the
steps
to
her
own
front
door
where
with
a
bow
and
a
few
last
kindly
words
he
left
her
and
walked
rapidly
away
the
girls
who
had
gathered
for
rehearsal
greeted
her
with
a
chorus
of
reproaches
for
being
so
late
but
when
patty
began
to
tell
her
exciting
experiences
the
rehearsal
was
forgotten
in
listening
to
the
thrilling
tale
come
on
now
said
patty
a
little
later
we
must
get
to
work
get
your
places
and
begin
your
lines
while
i
finish
these
patty
had
refused
to
go
to
luncheon
and
the
maid
had
brought
a
tray
into
the
library
for
her
so
with
a
sandwich
in
one
hand
and
a
glass
of
milk
in
the
other
she
directed
the
rehearsal
taking
her
own
part
therein
when
the
time
came
so
the
days
went
on
each
one
becoming
more
and
more
busy
as
the
fateful
time
drew
near
also
patty
became
more
and
more
nervous
she
had
far
more
to
do
than
any
of
the
other
girls
for
they
depended
on
her
in
every
emergency
referred
every
decision
to
her
and
seemed
to
expect
her
to
do
all
the
hardest
of
the
work
moreover
the
long
strain
of
overstudy
she
had
been
through
had
left
its
effects
on
her
system
and
patty
though
she
would
not
admit
it
and
no
one
else
realised
it
was
in
imminent
danger
of
an
attack
of
nervous
prostration
the
last
few
days
nan
had
begun
to
suspect
this
but
as
nothing
could
be
done
to
check
patty
mad
career
or
even
to
assist
her
in
the
many
things
she
had
to
do
nan
devoted
her
efforts
to
keeping
patty
strengthened
and
stimulated
and
was
constantly
appearing
to
her
with
a
cup
of
hot
beef
tea
or
of
strong
coffee
or
a
dose
of
some
highly
recommended
nerve
tonic
although
these
produced
good
temporary
effects
the
continued
use
of
these
remedies
really
aggravated
patty
condition
and
when
thursday
came
she
was
almost
a
wreck
both
physically
and
mentally
and
nan
was
at
her
wits
end
to
know
how
to
get
the
girl
through
the
day
at
the
summons
of
her
alarm
clock
patty
rose
early
in
the
morning
for
there
was
much
to
do
by
way
of
final
preparation
before
breakfast
she
had
attended
to
many
odds
and
ends
and
when
she
appeared
at
the
table
she
said
only
an
and
then
knit
her
brows
as
if
in
deep
and
anxious
thought
and
fairfield
looked
at
each
other
they
knew
that
to
say
a
word
to
patty
by
way
of
warning
would
be
likely
to
precipitate
the
breakdown
that
they
feared
so
they
were
careful
to
speak
very
casually
and
gently
anything
i
can
do
for
you
puss
said
her
father
kindly
no
said
patty
still
frowning
but
i
wish
the
flowers
would
come
i
have
to
make
garlands
before
i
go
over
to
the
schoolroom
and
i
must
be
there
by
ten
to
look
after
the
building
of
the
platform
ca
i
make
the
garlands
for
you
asked
nan
no
said
patty
they
have
to
be
made
a
special
way
and
you
only
spoil
them
but
if
you
showed
me
urged
nan
patiently
if
you
did
two
or
three
perhaps
i
could
copy
them
exactly
at
any
rate
let
me
try
very
well
said
patty
dully
i
wish
you
could
do
them
i
sure
the
flowers
were
delayed
as
is
not
unusual
in
such
cases
and
it
was
nearly
ten
when
they
arrived
patty
was
almost
frantic
by
that
time
and
nan
as
she
afterward
told
her
husband
had
to
handle
her
with
gloves
on
but
by
dint
of
tact
and
patience
nan
succeeded
in
persuading
patty
after
making
two
or
three
garlands
to
leave
the
rest
for
her
to
do
although
they
were
of
complicated
design
nan
was
clever
at
such
things
and
could
easily
copy
patty
work
and
had
she
been
herself
patty
would
have
known
this
but
so
upset
was
she
that
even
her
common
sense
seemed
warped
when
she
reached
the
schoolroom
there
were
a
thousand
and
one
things
to
see
to
and
nearly
all
of
them
were
going
wrong
patty
flew
from
one
thing
to
another
straightening
them
out
and
bringing
order
from
confusion
and
though
she
held
herself
well
in
hand
the
tension
was
growing
tighter
and
there
was
danger
of
her
losing
control
of
herself
at
any
minute
hilda
henderson
was
the
only
one
who
realised
this
and
taking
patty
aside
she
said
to
her
quietly
look
here
girl
i
attend
to
everything
else
there
not
much
left
that
needs
special
attention
and
i
want
you
to
go
right
straight
home
take
a
hot
bath
and
then
lie
down
and
rest
until
time
to
dress
for
the
afternoon
programme
will
you
patty
looked
at
hilda
with
a
queer
uncomprehending
gaze
she
seemed
scarcely
to
understand
what
was
being
said
to
her
yes
she
said
but
as
she
turned
she
half
stumbled
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
floor
if
hilda
had
not
caught
her
strongly
by
the
arm
brace
up
she
said
and
her
voice
was
stern
because
she
was
thoroughly
frightened
patty
fairfield
do
you
dare
to
collapse
now
if
you
do
i
i
do
know
i
do
to
you
come
on
now
i
go
home
with
you
hilda
was
really
afraid
to
let
patty
go
alone
so
hastily
donning
her
hat
and
coat
she
went
with
her
to
her
very
door
take
this
girl
she
said
to
nan
and
put
her
to
bed
and
do
let
her
see
anybody
or
say
anything
until
the
programme
begins
this
afternoon
i
look
after
everything
that
is
finished
if
you
just
keep
her
quiet
nan
was
thoroughly
alarmed
but
she
only
said
all
right
hilda
take
care
of
her
and
thank
you
very
much
for
bringing
her
home
patty
sank
down
on
a
couch
in
a
limp
heap
but
her
eyes
were
big
and
bright
as
she
looked
at
hilda
saying
see
that
the
stars
are
put
on
the
gilt
wands
and
the
green
bay
leaves
on
the
white
ones
spangled
skirt
is
in
miss
oliphant
room
and
please
be
sure
patty
did
finish
this
sentence
but
lay
back
among
the
cushions
exhausted
run
along
hilda
said
nan
do
the
best
you
can
with
the
stars
and
things
and
i
see
to
it
that
patty
all
right
by
afternoon
chapter
viii
commencement
day
nan
was
a
born
nurse
and
moreover
she
had
sufficient
common
sense
and
tact
to
know
how
to
deal
with
nervous
exhaustion
instead
of
discussing
the
situation
she
said
cheerily
now
everything
will
be
all
right
hilda
will
look
after
the
stars
and
wands
and
you
can
have
quite
a
little
time
to
rest
before
you
go
back
to
the
schoolroom
do
try
to
go
up
to
your
room
now
just
stay
right
where
you
are
and
i
bring
you
a
cup
of
hot
milk
which
is
just
what
you
need
patty
nestled
among
the
cushions
which
nan
patted
and
tucked
around
her
and
after
taking
the
hot
milk
felt
much
better
i
must
get
up
now
nan
she
pleaded
from
the
couch
where
she
lay
i
have
so
many
things
to
attend
to
patty
said
nan
looking
at
her
steadily
do
you
want
to
go
through
with
the
commencement
exercises
this
afternoon
and
the
play
successfully
or
do
you
want
to
collapse
on
the
stage
and
faint
right
before
all
the
audience
i
wo
do
any
such
foolish
thing
said
patty
indignantly
you
will
said
nan
unless
you
obey
me
implicitly
and
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
nan
manner
more
than
her
words
compelled
patty
obedience
and
with
a
sigh
the
tired
girl
closed
her
eyes
saying
all
right
nan
have
your
own
way
i
be
good
that
a
good
child
said
nan
soothingly
and
now
first
we
go
right
up
to
your
own
room
then
nan
helped
patty
into
a
soft
dressing
gown
made
her
lie
down
upon
her
bed
and
threw
a
light
afghan
over
her
then
sitting
beside
her
nan
talked
a
little
on
unimportant
matters
and
then
began
to
sing
softly
in
less
than
half
an
hour
patty
was
sound
asleep
and
nan
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
at
finding
her
efforts
had
been
successful
but
there
was
not
much
time
to
spare
for
the
commencement
exercises
began
at
three
so
at
two
patty
found
herself
gently
awakened
to
see
nan
at
her
bedside
arranging
a
dainty
tray
of
luncheon
which
a
maid
had
brought
in
here
you
are
girlie
said
the
cheery
voice
sit
up
now
and
see
what
we
have
for
you
here
patty
awoke
a
little
bewildered
but
soon
gathered
her
scattered
senses
and
viewed
with
pleasure
the
broiled
chicken
and
crisp
salad
before
her
exhaustion
had
made
her
hungry
and
while
she
ate
nan
busied
herself
in
getting
out
the
pretty
costume
that
patty
was
to
wear
at
commencement
but
the
sight
of
the
white
organdie
frock
with
its
fluffy
ruffles
and
soft
laces
brought
back
patty
apprehensions
oh
nan
she
cried
in
dismay
i
not
nearly
ready
for
commencement
i
have
copied
my
poem
yet
and
i
have
had
a
minute
to
practice
reading
it
for
the
last
two
weeks
what
shall
i
do
that
all
attended
to
said
nan
the
copying
i
mean
you
been
so
busy
doing
other
people
work
that
of
course
you
have
had
time
to
attend
to
your
own
so
i
gave
your
poem
to
your
father
and
he
had
it
typewritten
for
you
and
here
it
is
all
ready
now
while
you
dress
read
it
to
you
and
that
will
bring
it
back
to
your
memory
nan
you
are
a
dear
cried
patty
jumping
up
and
flying
across
the
room
to
give
her
stepmother
a
hearty
caress
whatever
would
i
do
without
you
i
all
right
now
and
if
you
just
elocute
that
thing
while
i
array
myself
in
purple
and
fine
linen
i
sure
it
will
all
come
back
to
me
so
nan
read
patty
jolly
little
class
poem
line
by
line
and
patty
repeated
it
after
her
as
she
proceeded
with
her
toilette
she
was
ready
before
the
appointed
time
and
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
but
nan
would
not
let
her
go
no
my
lady
she
said
you
do
stir
out
of
this
house
until
the
very
last
minute
if
you
get
over
there
ahead
of
time
you
begin
to
make
somebody
a
new
costume
or
build
a
throne
for
the
fairy
queen
or
some
foolish
trick
like
that
now
you
sit
right
straight
down
in
that
chair
and
read
your
poem
over
slowly
while
i
whip
into
my
own
clothes
and
then
we
go
along
together
fred
ca
come
until
a
little
later
anyway
sit
still
now
and
do
wriggle
around
and
spoil
that
pretty
frock
patty
obeyed
like
a
docile
child
and
nan
flew
away
to
don
her
own
pretty
gown
for
the
occasion
when
she
returned
in
a
soft
grey
crêpe
de
chine
with
a
big
grey
hat
and
feathers
she
was
such
a
pretty
picture
that
patty
involuntarily
exclaimed
in
admiration
i
glad
you
like
it
said
nan
i
want
to
look
my
best
so
as
to
do
you
credit
and
in
return
i
want
you
to
do
your
best
so
as
to
do
me
credit
i
will
said
patty
earnestly
i
truly
will
you
been
awfully
good
to
me
nan
and
but
for
you
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
away
they
went
and
when
they
reached
the
schoolroom
and
patty
went
to
join
her
classmates
while
nan
took
her
place
in
the
audience
she
said
as
a
parting
injunction
now
mind
patty
this
afternoon
you
to
attend
strictly
to
your
own
part
in
the
programme
do
go
around
helping
other
people
with
their
parts
because
this
is
the
time
for
that
you
have
all
you
can
do
to
manage
patty
fairfield
patty
laughed
and
promised
and
ran
away
to
the
schoolroom
the
moment
she
entered
half
a
dozen
girls
ran
to
her
with
questions
about
various
details
and
nan
warning
was
entirely
forgotten
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
hilda
intervention
patty
would
have
gone
to
work
at
a
piece
of
unfinished
scenery
drop
that
hammer
cried
hilda
as
patty
was
about
to
nail
some
branches
of
paper
roses
on
to
a
wobbly
green
arbour
patty
fairfield
are
you
crazy
the
idea
of
attempting
carpenter
work
with
that
delicate
frock
on
do
for
pity
sake
keep
yourself
decent
until
after
you
read
your
poem
at
least
patty
looked
at
hilda
with
that
same
peculiar
vacantness
in
her
glance
which
she
had
shown
in
the
morning
and
though
hilda
said
nothing
she
was
exceedingly
anxious
and
kept
a
sharp
watch
on
patty
movements
but
it
was
then
time
for
the
girls
to
march
onto
the
platform
and
as
patty
seemed
almost
like
herself
though
unusually
quiet
hilda
hoped
it
was
all
right
the
exercises
were
such
as
are
found
on
most
commencement
programmes
and
included
class
history
class
prophecy
class
song
and
all
of
the
usual
contributions
to
a
commencement
programme
patty
class
poem
was
near
the
end
of
the
list
and
nan
was
glad
for
she
felt
it
would
give
the
girl
more
time
to
regain
her
poise
fairfield
had
arrived
and
both
he
and
nan
waited
anxiously
for
turn
to
come
when
it
did
come
patty
proved
herself
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
her
poem
was
merry
and
clever
and
she
read
it
with
an
entire
absence
of
and
an
apparent
enjoyment
of
its
fun
she
looked
very
sweet
and
pretty
in
her
dainty
white
dress
and
she
stood
so
gracefully
and
seemed
so
calm
and
composed
that
only
those
who
knew
her
best
noticed
the
feverish
brightness
of
her
eyes
and
a
certain
tenseness
of
the
muscles
of
her
hands
but
this
was
not
unobserved
by
one
in
the
audience
hepworth
though
seated
far
back
noted
every
symptom
of
patty
nervousness
however
little
it
might
be
apparent
to
others
although
she
went
through
her
ordeal
successfully
he
knew
how
much
greater
would
be
the
excitement
and
responsibility
of
the
performance
and
he
wished
he
could
help
her
in
some
way
but
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
he
could
do
and
though
he
had
sent
her
a
beautiful
basket
of
roses
it
was
but
one
floral
gift
among
so
many
that
he
doubted
whether
patty
even
knew
that
he
sent
it
and
he
also
doubted
if
she
would
have
cared
especially
if
she
had
known
it
like
most
of
the
graduates
patty
received
quantities
of
floral
tributes
as
the
ushers
came
again
and
again
with
clusters
or
baskets
of
flowers
the
audience
heartily
applauded
and
patty
though
embarrassed
a
little
preserved
a
pretty
dignity
and
showed
a
happy
enjoyment
of
it
all
as
soon
as
the
diplomas
were
awarded
and
patty
had
her
cherished
roll
tied
with
its
blue
ribbon
nan
told
fairfield
that
it
was
imperative
that
patty
should
be
made
to
go
straight
home
if
she
stays
there
said
nan
she
get
excited
and
exhausted
and
be
good
for
nothing
i
gave
her
some
stimulants
this
noon
although
she
did
know
it
but
the
effects
are
wearing
off
and
a
reaction
will
soon
set
in
she
must
come
home
with
us
at
once
you
are
right
fairfield
said
hepworth
who
had
crossed
the
room
and
joined
them
just
in
time
to
hear
nan
last
words
patty
is
holding
herself
together
by
sheer
nervous
force
and
she
needs
care
if
she
is
to
keep
up
through
the
evening
that
is
certainly
true
said
nan
kenneth
she
added
turning
to
young
harper
who
stood
near
by
you
have
a
good
deal
of
influence
with
patty
go
and
get
her
wo
you
make
her
come
at
once
all
right
said
kenneth
and
he
was
off
in
a
moment
while
hepworth
looked
after
him
secretly
wishing
that
the
errand
might
have
been
entrusted
to
him
but
kenneth
found
his
task
no
easy
one
although
patty
willingly
consented
to
his
request
and
even
started
toward
the
to
get
her
wraps
she
paused
so
many
times
to
speak
to
different
ones
or
her
progress
was
stopped
by
girls
who
wanted
her
help
or
advice
that
kenneth
almost
despaired
of
getting
her
away
ca
you
make
her
come
hilda
he
said
i
try
said
hilda
but
when
she
tried
patty
only
said
yes
hilda
in
just
a
minute
i
want
to
coach
mary
a
little
in
her
part
and
i
want
to
show
hester
where
to
stand
in
the
third
act
never
mind
said
hilda
impatiently
let
her
stand
on
the
roof
if
she
wants
to
but
for
goodness
sake
go
on
home
your
people
are
waiting
for
you
again
patty
looked
at
her
with
that
queer
vacant
gaze
and
then
lorraine
hart
stepped
forward
and
took
matters
in
her
own
hands
march
she
said
as
she
grasped
patty
arm
and
steered
her
toward
the
halt
she
said
after
they
reached
it
and
then
while
patty
stood
still
seemingly
dazed
lorraine
put
her
cloak
about
her
threw
her
scarf
over
her
head
wheeled
her
about
and
marched
her
back
to
where
kenneth
stood
waiting
take
her
quick
she
said
take
her
right
to
the
carriage
do
let
her
stop
to
speak
to
anybody
so
kenneth
grasped
patty
arm
firmly
and
led
her
through
the
crowd
of
girls
out
of
the
door
and
down
the
walk
to
the
carriage
ordinarily
patty
would
have
resented
this
summary
treatment
but
still
in
a
way
she
meekly
went
where
she
was
led
once
in
the
carriage
nan
sat
beside
her
and
fairfield
opposite
and
they
started
for
home
no
reference
was
made
to
patty
herself
but
the
others
talked
lightly
and
pleasantly
of
the
afternoon
performance
on
reaching
home
nan
put
patty
to
bed
at
once
and
telephoned
for
the
doctor
but
when
martin
came
nan
met
him
downstairs
and
told
him
all
about
the
case
they
then
decided
that
the
doctor
should
not
see
patty
as
to
realise
the
fact
that
she
was
in
need
of
medical
attendance
might
prove
a
serious
shock
and
really
doctor
said
nan
if
the
girl
should
be
allowed
at
least
to
try
to
go
through
with
the
play
this
evening
i
would
like
to
answer
for
the
consequences
i
understand
said
martin
and
though
i
think
that
with
the
aid
of
certain
prescriptions
i
shall
give
you
she
can
probably
get
through
the
evening
it
would
be
far
better
if
she
did
not
attempt
it
i
know
it
doctor
said
nan
and
with
some
girls
it
might
be
possible
to
persuade
them
to
give
it
up
but
i
ca
help
feeling
that
if
we
even
advised
patty
not
to
go
she
would
fly
into
violent
hysterics
very
likely
said
martin
and
i
think
fairfield
you
are
right
in
your
diagnosis
if
you
will
give
her
these
drops
exactly
as
i
have
directed
i
think
she
will
brace
up
sufficiently
to
go
through
her
part
all
right
nan
thanked
the
doctor
and
hurried
back
to
patty
room
to
look
after
her
charge
she
found
patty
lying
quietly
but
in
a
state
of
mental
excitement
when
nan
came
in
she
began
to
talk
rapidly
it
all
right
nan
dear
she
said
i
not
ill
a
bit
please
let
me
get
up
now
and
dress
so
i
can
go
around
to
the
schoolroom
a
little
bit
early
there
are
two
or
three
things
i
must
look
after
and
then
the
play
will
go
off
all
right
very
well
said
nan
humouring
her
if
you
will
just
take
this
medicine
it
will
brace
you
up
for
the
evening
and
you
can
go
through
with
the
play
as
successfully
as
you
did
your
part
this
afternoon
patty
agreed
and
took
the
drops
the
doctor
had
left
without
a
murmur
soon
their
soothing
effect
became
apparent
and
patty
nervous
enthusiasm
quieted
down
to
such
an
extent
that
she
seemed
in
no
haste
to
go
she
ate
her
dinner
slowly
and
dawdled
over
her
dressing
until
nan
again
became
alarmed
lest
the
medicine
had
been
too
powerful
poor
nan
really
had
a
hard
time
of
it
patty
was
not
a
tractable
patient
and
nan
was
frequently
at
her
wits
end
to
know
just
how
to
manage
her
but
at
last
she
was
ready
and
they
all
started
for
the
school
again
although
patty
own
people
and
a
few
of
her
intimate
girl
friends
knew
of
her
overwrought
state
most
of
the
class
and
even
the
teachers
had
no
idea
how
near
to
a
nervous
breakdown
she
was
for
her
demeanour
was
much
as
usual
and
though
she
would
have
moments
of
dazed
bewilderment
much
of
the
time
she
was
unusually
alert
and
she
flew
about
attending
to
certain
last
details
in
an
efficient
and
manner
chapter
ix
the
play
the
play
went
through
beautifully
every
girl
did
her
part
wonderfully
well
but
patty
surpassed
them
all
buoyed
up
by
excitement
she
played
her
part
with
a
dash
and
sprightliness
that
surprised
even
the
girls
who
had
seen
her
at
rehearsal
she
was
roguish
merry
and
tragic
by
turns
and
she
sang
her
solos
with
a
dramatic
effect
that
brought
down
the
house
she
looked
unusually
pretty
which
was
partly
the
effect
of
her
intense
excitement
and
though
nan
and
fairfield
could
not
help
admiring
and
applauding
with
the
rest
they
were
very
anxious
and
really
alarmed
lest
she
might
not
be
able
to
keep
up
to
these
emotional
heights
until
the
end
of
the
play
without
speaking
his
thoughts
to
anyone
else
hepworth
too
was
very
much
concerned
for
patty
welfare
he
realised
the
danger
she
was
in
and
noted
every
evidence
of
her
artificial
strength
and
merriment
seeing
martin
in
a
seat
near
the
back
of
the
room
he
quietly
rose
and
went
and
sat
beside
the
old
gentleman
doctor
he
said
i
ca
help
fearing
that
a
collapse
of
some
sort
will
follow
miss
fairfield
performance
i
am
sure
of
it
said
the
doctor
looking
gravely
at
hepworth
then
do
you
think
perhaps
it
would
be
wise
for
you
to
go
around
behind
the
scenes
presently
and
be
there
in
case
of
emergency
i
will
gladly
do
so
said
martin
if
and
fairfield
authorise
it
hepworth
looked
at
his
programme
and
then
he
looked
at
patty
he
knew
the
play
pretty
thoroughly
and
he
knew
that
she
was
making
one
of
the
final
speeches
he
saw
too
that
she
had
nearly
reached
the
limit
of
her
endurance
and
he
said
martin
i
wish
you
would
go
on
my
authority
the
fairfields
are
sitting
in
the
front
part
of
the
house
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
speak
to
them
about
it
without
creating
a
commotion
and
besides
i
think
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
this
is
almost
the
end
of
the
play
and
in
my
judgment
miss
fairfield
is
pretty
nearly
at
the
end
of
her
martin
gave
the
younger
man
a
searching
glance
and
then
said
you
are
right
hepworth
it
may
be
advisable
that
i
should
be
there
when
miss
fairfield
comes
off
the
stage
i
will
go
at
once
will
you
come
with
me
yes
said
hepworth
and
the
two
men
quietly
left
the
room
and
hastened
around
the
building
to
the
side
entrance
as
hepworth
had
assisted
with
the
scenery
for
the
play
and
had
been
present
at
one
or
two
rehearsals
he
knew
his
way
about
and
guided
martin
through
the
corridors
to
the
room
where
the
girls
were
gathered
waiting
their
cue
to
go
on
the
stage
for
the
final
tableau
and
chorus
lorraine
and
hilda
looked
at
each
other
comprehendingly
as
the
two
men
appeared
but
the
other
girls
wondered
at
this
apparent
intrusion
then
as
the
time
came
they
all
went
on
the
stage
and
martin
and
hepworth
watching
from
the
side
saw
them
form
the
pretty
final
tableau
patty
in
a
spangled
dress
and
tinsel
crown
waving
a
gilt
wand
stood
on
a
high
pedestal
around
her
on
lower
pedestals
and
on
the
floor
were
the
rest
of
the
fairy
maidens
in
their
glittering
costumes
the
last
notes
of
the
chorus
rang
out
and
amidst
a
burst
of
applause
the
curtain
fell
the
applause
continued
so
strongly
that
the
curtain
was
immediately
raised
again
and
the
delighted
audience
viewed
once
more
the
pretty
scene
hepworth
was
nearer
the
stage
than
martin
in
fact
in
his
anxiety
he
was
almost
edging
on
to
it
and
while
the
curtain
was
up
and
the
audience
was
applauding
and
the
orchestra
was
playing
and
the
calcium
lights
were
flashing
their
rays
his
intense
watchfulness
noticed
a
slight
shudder
pass
over
patty
form
then
she
swayed
slightly
and
her
eyes
closed
in
a
flash
hepworth
had
himself
rung
the
bell
that
meant
the
drop
of
the
curtain
and
as
the
curtain
came
down
he
sprang
forward
among
the
bewildered
girls
and
reached
the
tall
pedestal
just
in
time
to
catch
patty
as
she
tottered
and
fell
she
has
only
fainted
he
said
as
he
carried
her
off
the
stage
please
do
crowd
around
she
will
be
all
right
in
a
moment
he
carried
her
to
the
and
gently
laid
her
on
a
couch
martin
followed
closely
and
hepworth
left
patty
in
his
charge
you
miss
hamilton
go
in
there
he
said
to
lorraine
at
the
door
and
see
if
you
can
help
martin
i
will
speak
to
the
fairfields
and
see
that
the
carriage
is
ready
i
do
think
the
audience
knows
anything
about
it
and
there
need
be
no
fuss
or
commotion
hilda
grasped
the
situation
and
kept
the
crowd
of
anxious
girls
out
of
the
while
martin
administered
restoratives
to
patty
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
overcome
the
faintness
that
had
seized
upon
her
when
at
last
she
did
open
her
eyes
it
was
only
to
close
them
again
in
another
period
of
exhaustion
however
this
seemed
to
encourage
martin
it
better
than
i
feared
he
said
she
is
delirious
there
is
no
threat
of
brain
fever
she
will
soon
revive
now
and
we
can
safely
take
her
home
and
so
when
the
doctor
declared
that
she
might
now
be
moved
fairfield
supported
her
on
one
side
and
kenneth
on
the
other
as
they
took
her
to
the
carriage
get
in
fairfield
said
kenneth
after
patty
was
safely
seated
by
her
father
and
you
too
martin
i
jump
up
on
the
box
with
the
driver
perhaps
i
can
help
you
at
the
house
so
away
they
went
without
a
word
or
a
thought
for
poor
hepworth
to
whose
watchfulness
was
really
due
the
fact
of
martin
opportune
assistance
and
too
if
hepworth
had
not
seen
the
first
signs
of
patty
loss
of
consciousness
her
fall
from
the
high
pedestal
might
have
proved
a
serious
accident
although
martin
told
the
family
afterward
of
hepworth
kind
thoughtfulness
it
went
unnoted
at
the
time
but
of
this
hepworth
himself
was
rather
glad
than
otherwise
his
affection
for
patty
was
such
that
he
did
not
wish
the
girl
to
feel
that
she
owed
him
gratitude
and
he
preferred
to
have
no
claim
of
the
sort
upon
her
when
the
party
reached
the
fairfield
house
patty
had
revived
enough
to
talk
rationally
but
she
was
very
weak
and
seemed
to
have
lost
all
enthusiasm
and
even
interest
in
the
occasion
it
all
over
is
it
she
asked
of
her
father
in
a
helpless
pathetic
little
voice
yes
puss
said
fairfield
cheerily
it
all
over
and
it
was
a
perfect
success
now
do
bother
your
head
about
it
any
more
but
just
get
rested
and
get
a
good
sleep
and
then
we
talk
it
over
patty
was
quite
willing
not
to
discuss
the
subject
and
with
assistance
she
was
soon
in
bed
and
sound
asleep
martin
stood
watching
her
i
do
know
he
said
to
nan
whether
this
sleep
will
last
or
not
if
it
does
all
will
be
well
but
she
may
wake
up
soon
and
become
nervous
and
hysterical
in
that
case
give
her
these
drops
which
will
have
a
speedy
effect
i
will
be
around
again
early
morning
but
the
doctor
fears
were
not
realised
patty
slept
deeply
all
through
the
night
and
had
not
waked
when
the
doctor
came
in
the
morning
do
waken
her
he
said
as
he
looked
at
the
sleeping
girl
she
all
right
there
no
fear
of
nervous
prostration
now
the
stress
is
over
and
her
good
constitution
and
healthy
nature
are
reasserting
themselves
and
will
conquer
she
is
of
a
nervous
temperament
and
she
is
simply
exhausted
from
overwork
do
waken
her
let
her
sleep
it
out
and
so
patty
slept
until
afternoon
and
then
awoke
feeling
more
like
her
old
self
than
she
had
for
many
days
nan
she
called
and
nan
came
flying
in
from
the
next
room
i
awful
hungry
said
patty
and
i
am
pretty
tired
but
the
play
is
over
is
it
nan
i
ca
seem
to
remember
about
last
night
yes
it
over
patsy
and
everything
is
all
right
and
you
have
a
thing
to
do
but
get
rested
will
you
have
your
breakfast
now
or
your
luncheon
because
you
really
skipped
both
then
i
have
them
both
said
patty
with
decision
i
hungry
enough
to
eat
a
house
later
patty
insisted
on
dressing
and
going
downstairs
for
dinner
declaring
she
felt
perfectly
well
but
the
exertion
tired
her
more
than
she
cared
to
admit
and
when
martin
came
in
the
evening
she
questioned
him
directly
i
not
really
ill
am
i
martin
i
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
wo
i
it
so
silly
to
get
tired
just
walking
downstairs
do
be
alarmed
said
the
old
doctor
you
will
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
by
day
after
you
can
walk
downstairs
or
run
down
if
you
like
without
feeling
tired
at
all
then
that
all
right
said
patty
i
suppose
i
did
do
too
much
with
my
school
work
and
the
play
and
everything
but
i
could
seem
to
help
it
and
if
i
get
over
it
in
a
week
i
be
satisfied
in
fact
i
mind
a
bit
lounging
around
and
resting
for
a
few
days
that
just
the
thing
for
you
to
do
agreed
martin
and
i
give
you
another
prescription
after
a
week
or
two
of
rest
you
need
recreation
you
must
get
out
of
the
city
and
go
somewhere
in
the
country
not
seashore
or
the
mountains
just
yet
but
away
into
the
country
where
you
have
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
nothing
to
do
you
must
look
at
a
book
of
any
sort
or
description
for
a
month
or
two
at
least
will
you
promise
me
that
with
great
pleasure
said
patty
gaily
i
do
think
i
shall
care
to
see
a
book
all
summer
long
not
a
schoolbook
anyway
i
suppose
i
may
read
storybooks
not
at
present
said
the
doctor
let
alone
books
of
all
sorts
for
a
couple
of
months
and
after
that
i
see
about
it
what
you
want
is
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
outdoor
exercise
then
you
get
back
the
roses
in
your
cheeks
and
add
a
few
pounds
of
flesh
to
your
attenuated
frame
your
prescription
sounds
attractive
said
patty
but
where
shall
i
go
we
arrange
all
that
said
fairfield
i
think
myself
that
all
you
need
is
recreation
and
rest
with
a
fair
proportion
of
each
so
do
i
said
patty
i
do
want
to
go
to
an
old
farmhouse
where
there
is
a
thing
to
do
but
walk
in
the
orchard
i
want
to
go
where
i
have
some
fun
go
ahead
said
the
doctor
fun
wo
hurt
you
any
as
long
as
outdoor
sports
or
merry
society
but
do
get
up
any
plays
or
any
such
foolishness
where
fun
is
only
a
mistaken
name
for
hard
work
patty
promised
this
and
martin
went
away
without
any
doubts
as
to
the
speedy
and
entire
recovery
of
his
patient
fairfield
and
nan
quite
agreed
with
the
doctor
opinion
that
patty
ought
to
go
away
for
a
rest
and
a
pleasant
vacation
the
next
thing
was
to
decide
where
she
should
go
it
was
out
of
the
question
of
course
to
consider
any
strange
place
for
her
to
go
alone
and
as
fairfield
could
not
begin
his
vacation
until
july
and
nan
was
not
willing
to
leave
him
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
to
accompany
patty
the
only
places
therefore
that
fairfield
could
think
of
were
for
her
to
go
to
vernondale
and
visit
the
elliotts
or
down
to
the
where
the
barlows
had
already
gone
for
their
summer
season
but
neither
of
these
plans
suited
patty
at
all
for
she
said
that
vernondale
would
be
no
rest
and
not
much
fun
she
was
fond
of
her
elliott
cousins
but
she
felt
sure
that
they
would
treat
her
as
a
and
coddle
her
until
she
went
frantic
the
she
said
would
be
just
the
opposite
they
would
have
no
consideration
down
there
for
the
fact
that
she
wanted
a
rest
but
would
make
her
jog
about
hither
and
thither
taking
long
tramps
and
going
on
tiresome
picnics
whether
she
wanted
to
or
not
so
neither
of
these
plans
seemed
just
the
thing
and
nan
proposal
that
patty
go
to
philadelphia
and
spend
june
with
allen
was
quite
what
patty
wanted
indeed
patty
did
not
know
herself
exactly
what
she
wanted
which
was
pretty
good
proof
that
she
was
not
so
far
from
the
borders
of
nervous
land
as
they
had
believed
and
so
when
elise
came
over
one
afternoon
and
brought
with
her
an
invitation
for
patty
that
young
woman
showed
no
hesitation
in
announcing
at
once
that
it
was
exactly
what
she
wanted
the
invitation
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
to
go
on
a
long
trip
with
the
farringtons
it
will
be
perfectly
splendid
said
elise
if
you
only
go
patty
go
said
patty
i
should
think
i
would
go
it
perfectly
splendid
of
you
to
invite
me
who
are
going
just
father
and
mother
and
roger
and
myself
said
elise
and
you
will
make
five
roger
can
run
the
car
or
father
can
either
for
that
matter
so
we
wo
take
a
man
and
father
has
had
a
new
top
put
on
his
big
and
we
can
pile
any
amount
of
luggage
up
on
it
so
you
can
take
all
the
frocks
you
want
to
we
stop
at
places
here
and
there
you
know
to
visit
and
of
course
we
always
stop
for
meals
and
to
stay
over
night
but
perhaps
they
would
want
me
said
patty
where
you
go
to
visit
nonsense
of
course
they
will
why
i
wrote
to
bertha
warner
that
i
wanted
to
bring
you
and
she
said
she
love
to
have
you
come
how
could
she
say
so
she
does
know
me
well
i
told
her
all
about
you
and
she
fully
prepared
to
love
you
as
i
do
oh
do
you
suppose
your
people
will
let
you
go
of
course
they
will
they
be
perfectly
delighted
to
have
me
go
patty
was
right
when
she
told
her
father
and
nan
about
the
delightful
invitation
they
were
almost
as
pleased
as
she
was
herself
and
fairfield
gave
ready
permission
the
projected
trip
entirely
fulfilled
martin
requisites
of
fresh
air
exercise
and
a
good
time
and
when
he
was
told
of
the
plan
he
also
expressed
his
entire
approval
chapter
x
a
motor
trip
preparations
began
at
once
it
was
now
the
first
of
june
and
they
were
to
start
on
the
sixth
there
were
delightful
shopping
excursions
for
the
replenishing
of
wardrobe
and
nan
gladly
assisted
patty
to
get
everything
in
order
for
her
trip
at
last
the
day
of
starting
came
and
a
more
beautiful
day
could
not
be
imagined
it
was
typical
june
weather
and
the
sun
shone
pleasantly
but
not
too
warmly
from
a
clear
blue
sky
patty
only
experience
in
motoring
had
been
her
trip
to
atlantic
city
but
that
was
only
a
short
ride
compared
to
the
contemplated
tour
of
the
farringtons
farrington
huge
car
seemed
to
be
furnished
with
everything
necessary
for
a
long
journey
although
they
would
usually
take
their
meals
at
hotels
in
the
towns
through
which
they
passed
farrington
explained
they
might
occasionally
wish
to
have
tea
or
even
luncheon
on
the
road
so
the
car
was
provided
with
both
and
the
novelty
of
this
paraphernalia
was
fascinating
to
patty
and
she
peeped
into
the
baskets
with
chuckles
of
delight
at
the
anticipated
pleasure
of
making
use
of
them
patty
trunk
was
put
up
on
top
among
the
others
her
was
stowed
away
in
its
place
and
with
affectionate
to
nan
and
her
father
she
took
her
seat
in
the
tonneau
between
farrington
and
elise
and
away
they
started
farrington
and
roger
who
sat
in
front
were
in
the
gayest
of
spirits
and
everything
was
promising
for
a
happy
journey
as
they
threaded
their
way
through
the
crowded
city
streets
patty
rejoiced
to
think
that
they
would
soon
be
out
in
the
open
country
where
they
would
have
wide
roads
with
comparatively
few
travellers
what
is
the
name
of
your
machine
mr
farrington
she
asked
as
they
whizzed
along
i
may
as
well
own
up
that
gentleman
answered
laughing
i
have
named
it
fact
fact
repeated
patty
what
a
funny
name
why
do
you
call
it
that
you
must
have
some
reason
i
have
said
farrington
in
a
tone
of
mock
despair
i
call
it
the
fact
because
it
is
a
stubborn
thing
patty
laughed
merrily
at
this
i
afraid
it
a
libel
she
said
sure
i
do
see
anything
stubborn
about
the
way
it
acts
it
going
beautifully
yes
it
is
said
farrington
and
i
hope
it
will
continue
to
do
so
but
i
may
as
well
warn
you
that
it
has
a
most
reprehensible
habit
of
stopping
now
and
then
and
utterly
refusing
to
proceed
and
this
without
any
apparent
reason
except
sheer
stubbornness
how
do
you
finally
induce
it
to
move
asked
patty
interested
by
this
trait
we
do
induce
it
said
elise
we
just
sit
and
wait
and
when
the
old
thing
gets
ready
to
move
it
just
draws
a
long
breath
and
humps
itself
up
and
down
a
few
times
and
turns
a
couple
of
somersaults
and
moves
on
what
an
exciting
experience
said
patty
when
do
you
think
it
will
begin
any
such
performance
as
that
you
ca
tell
said
farrington
it
as
uncertain
as
the
weather
more
so
said
roger
the
weather
sometimes
gives
you
warning
of
its
intentions
but
the
fact
just
selects
a
moment
when
you
the
farthest
possible
distance
from
civilisation
or
help
of
any
kind
and
then
it
just
sits
down
and
refuses
to
get
up
well
we
wo
cross
that
bridge
until
we
come
to
it
said
farrington
sometimes
we
run
a
week
without
any
such
mishap
and
truly
there
seemed
no
danger
at
present
for
the
big
car
drove
ahead
as
smoothly
and
easily
as
a
railroad
train
and
patty
lay
back
in
the
luxurious
tonneau
feeling
that
at
last
she
could
get
rested
and
have
a
good
time
both
at
once
the
wonderful
exhilaration
of
the
swift
motion
through
the
soft
june
air
the
delightful
sensation
of
the
breeze
which
was
caused
by
the
motion
of
the
car
and
the
natural
panorama
on
either
side
of
her
gave
patty
the
sensation
of
having
suddenly
been
transported
to
some
other
country
than
that
in
which
she
had
been
living
the
past
few
weeks
and
so
pleasantly
friendly
were
her
relations
with
farrington
and
elise
that
it
did
not
seem
necessary
to
make
remarks
for
the
sake
of
keeping
up
the
conversation
there
was
much
pleasant
chat
and
discussion
as
they
passed
points
of
interest
or
diverting
scenes
but
then
again
there
were
occasional
pauses
when
they
all
gave
themselves
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
delightful
motion
of
the
car
patty
began
to
realise
what
was
meant
by
the
phrase
automobile
elation
she
seemed
to
feel
an
uplifting
of
her
spirit
and
a
strange
thrill
of
exquisite
happiness
while
all
trace
of
nervousness
or
petty
worry
was
brushed
away
like
a
cobweb
her
lungs
seemed
filled
with
pure
air
and
further
she
had
a
whimsical
sense
that
she
was
breathing
the
very
blue
of
the
sky
she
said
this
to
farrington
and
that
lady
smiled
as
she
answered
that
right
patty
if
you
feel
that
way
you
are
a
true
motorist
not
everyone
does
there
are
some
who
only
look
upon
a
as
a
machine
to
transport
them
from
one
place
to
another
but
to
me
it
is
the
very
fairyland
of
motion
patty
eyes
shone
in
sympathy
with
this
idea
but
roger
turned
around
laughingly
and
said
you
better
be
careful
how
you
breathe
the
blue
sky
patty
for
there
a
little
cloud
over
there
that
may
stick
in
your
throat
patty
looked
at
the
tiny
white
cloud
and
responded
if
you
go
much
faster
roger
i
afraid
we
fly
right
up
there
and
run
over
that
poor
little
cloud
let
do
it
said
roger
there
no
fine
for
running
over
a
cloud
is
there
dad
as
he
spoke
roger
put
on
a
higher
speed
and
then
they
flew
so
fast
that
patty
began
to
be
almost
frightened
but
her
fear
did
not
last
long
for
in
a
moment
the
great
car
gave
a
kind
of
a
groan
and
then
a
snort
and
then
a
wheeze
and
stopped
not
suddenly
but
with
a
provokingly
determined
slowness
that
seemed
to
imply
no
intention
of
moving
on
again
after
a
moment
the
great
wheels
ceased
to
revolve
and
the
car
stood
stubbornly
still
while
farrington
and
roger
looked
at
each
other
with
faces
of
comical
dismay
we
in
for
it
said
farrington
in
a
resigned
tone
then
we
must
get
out
for
it
said
roger
as
he
jumped
down
from
his
seat
and
opened
the
farrington
groaned
now
you
see
patty
she
said
how
the
car
lives
up
to
its
name
i
hoped
this
would
happen
so
soon
what
is
the
matter
asked
patty
why
does
it
go
patty
said
elise
looking
at
her
solemnly
i
see
you
have
yet
to
learn
the
first
lesson
of
automobile
etiquette
never
my
child
whatever
happens
inquire
why
a
car
does
go
that
is
something
that
nobody
ever
knows
and
they
would
tell
if
they
did
know
and
besides
if
they
did
know
they
know
wrong
farrington
laughed
at
elise
coherent
explanation
but
she
admitted
that
it
was
pretty
nearly
right
after
all
meanwhile
farrington
and
roger
with
various
tools
were
tinkering
at
the
car
here
and
there
and
though
they
did
not
seem
to
be
doing
any
good
yet
they
were
evidently
not
discouraged
for
they
were
whistling
gaily
and
now
and
then
made
jesting
remarks
about
the
hopelessness
of
ever
moving
on
again
i
think
there
water
in
the
tubes
said
roger
but
dad
thinks
it
a
choked
carburetter
so
we
going
to
doctor
for
both
very
well
said
farrington
calmly
as
there
no
special
scenery
to
look
at
about
here
i
think
i
shall
take
a
little
nap
you
girls
can
get
out
and
stroll
around
if
you
like
farrington
settled
herself
comfortably
in
her
corner
and
closed
her
eyes
elise
and
patty
did
get
out
and
walked
up
and
down
the
road
a
little
and
then
sat
down
on
the
bank
by
the
roadside
to
chat
for
the
twentieth
time
or
more
they
talked
over
all
the
details
of
commencement
day
and
congratulated
themselves
anew
on
the
success
of
their
entertainment
at
last
after
they
had
waited
nearly
two
hours
roger
declared
that
there
was
no
earthly
reason
why
they
should
start
if
they
cared
to
it
was
part
of
roger
fun
always
to
pretend
that
he
could
go
on
at
any
moment
if
he
desired
to
and
when
kept
waiting
by
the
misconduct
of
the
car
he
always
made
believe
that
he
delayed
the
trip
solely
for
his
own
pleasure
likewise
if
under
such
trying
circumstances
as
they
had
just
passed
through
he
heard
other
automobiles
or
wagons
coming
he
would
drop
his
tools
lean
idly
against
the
car
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
whistling
and
apparently
waiting
there
at
his
own
pleasure
all
this
amused
patty
very
much
and
she
began
as
elise
said
to
learn
the
rules
of
automobile
etiquette
it
was
not
difficult
with
the
farringtons
for
they
all
had
a
good
sense
of
humour
and
were
always
more
inclined
to
laugh
than
cry
over
spilled
milk
when
roger
made
this
announcement
elise
jumped
up
and
crying
come
on
patty
ran
back
to
the
car
and
jumped
in
purposely
waking
her
mother
as
she
did
so
farrington
placidly
took
in
the
situation
and
remarked
that
she
was
in
no
hurry
but
if
they
cared
to
go
on
she
was
quite
ready
and
so
with
laughter
and
gay
chatter
they
started
on
again
and
the
car
ran
as
smoothly
as
it
had
before
the
halt
but
it
was
nearly
sundown
and
there
were
many
miles
yet
to
travel
before
they
reached
the
hotel
where
they
had
expected
to
dine
and
stay
over
night
shall
we
go
on
mother
said
farrington
can
you
wait
until
nine
or
thereabouts
for
your
dinner
or
shall
we
stop
at
some
farmhouse
and
so
keep
ourselves
from
starvation
i
would
rather
go
on
said
farrington
if
the
girls
do
mind
the
girls
did
mind
and
so
they
plunged
ahead
while
the
sun
set
and
the
darkness
fell
there
was
no
moon
and
a
slight
cloudiness
hid
the
stars
roger
lighted
the
lamps
but
they
cast
such
weird
shadows
that
they
seemed
to
make
the
darkness
blacker
than
ever
patty
was
not
exactly
afraid
but
the
experience
was
so
new
to
her
that
she
felt
she
would
be
glad
when
they
reached
the
hotel
perhaps
farrington
discerned
this
for
he
took
especial
pains
to
entertain
his
young
guest
and
divert
her
mind
from
thoughts
of
possible
danger
so
he
beguiled
the
way
with
jokes
and
funny
stories
until
patty
forgot
her
anxiety
and
the
first
thing
she
knew
they
were
rolling
up
the
driveway
to
the
hotel
floods
of
light
streamed
from
the
windows
and
the
great
doors
and
strains
of
music
could
be
heard
from
within
thank
goodness
we
here
said
farrington
jump
out
girlies
and
let
us
seek
shelter
at
once
roger
remained
in
the
car
to
take
it
away
to
the
garage
and
farrington
accompanied
the
ladies
into
the
hotel
much
as
she
had
enjoyed
the
ride
patty
felt
glad
to
get
into
the
warm
lighted
house
and
very
soon
the
party
were
shown
to
their
rooms
patty
and
elise
shared
a
large
room
whose
twin
beds
were
covered
with
spreads
of
chintz
curtains
of
the
same
material
hung
at
the
windows
and
draped
the
what
a
pleasant
homelike
room
said
patty
as
she
looked
about
yes
said
elise
this
is
a
nice
old
country
hotel
we
been
here
before
hurry
patty
let
dress
for
dinner
quickly
but
patty
was
surveying
herself
in
the
long
pierglass
that
hung
between
two
windows
nan
had
selected
her
motoring
outfit
and
she
had
donned
it
that
morning
so
hastily
that
she
had
really
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
herself
but
now
as
she
looked
at
the
rather
shapeless
figure
in
the
long
pongee
coat
and
the
queer
shirred
hood
of
the
same
material
and
as
she
noted
the
voluminous
chiffon
veil
with
its
funny
little
front
window
of
mica
she
concluded
that
she
looked
more
like
a
goblin
in
a
fairy
play
than
a
human
being
do
stop
admiring
your
new
clothes
patty
and
get
dressed
said
elise
who
was
on
her
knees
before
an
open
suitcase
shaking
out
patty
skirt
and
bodice
get
off
those
togs
and
get
ready
to
put
these
on
this
is
a
sweet
little
dresden
silk
i
did
know
you
had
it
is
it
new
yes
said
patty
nan
bought
it
for
me
she
said
it
would
take
much
room
in
the
suitcase
and
would
be
useful
for
a
dinner
dress
it
lovely
said
elise
now
get
into
it
and
i
hook
you
up
so
patty
got
out
of
what
she
called
her
goblin
clothes
but
was
still
giggling
at
them
as
she
hung
them
away
in
the
wardrobe
less
than
half
an
hour
later
the
two
girls
spick
and
span
in
their
dainty
dresses
and
with
fresh
white
bows
on
their
hair
went
together
down
the
staircase
they
found
and
farrington
awaiting
them
and
soon
roger
appeared
and
they
went
to
the
for
a
late
dinner
then
patty
discovered
what
automobile
hunger
was
i
simply
ravenous
she
declared
but
i
did
know
it
until
this
minute
that
part
of
the
experience
said
farrington
the
appetite
caused
by
motoring
is
the
largest
known
variety
and
that
why
i
wanted
to
push
on
here
where
we
could
get
a
good
dinner
instead
of
taking
our
chances
at
some
farmhouse
they
were
the
only
guests
in
the
at
that
late
hour
and
so
they
made
a
merry
meal
of
it
and
after
dinner
went
back
to
the
large
parlours
to
sit
for
a
while
listening
to
the
music
but
they
did
not
tarry
long
for
as
patty
discovered
another
consequence
of
a
motor
ride
was
a
strong
inclination
to
go
to
bed
early
chapter
xi
dick
phelps
the
travellers
did
not
rise
early
the
next
morning
and
ten
found
them
still
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
i
do
hate
to
hurry
said
farrington
comfortably
sipping
her
coffee
so
many
people
think
that
an
automobile
tour
means
getting
up
early
and
hustling
off
at
daybreak
i
glad
those
are
your
sentiments
said
patty
for
i
quite
agree
with
you
i
done
enough
hustling
the
last
month
or
two
and
i
delighted
to
take
things
more
slowly
for
a
change
i
think
said
farrington
that
as
it
is
such
a
pleasant
day
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
take
some
luncheon
with
us
and
picnic
by
the
roadside
we
could
then
get
to
the
time
for
dinner
though
perhaps
a
little
late
lovely
cried
elise
i
perfectly
crazy
to
use
that
new
it
great
patty
it
has
the
cunningest
alcohol
stove
and
every
little
contraption
you
could
possibly
think
of
i
know
it
said
patty
i
peeped
inside
yesterday
and
the
array
of
forks
and
spoons
and
plates
and
bottles
was
perfectly
fascinating
very
well
said
farrington
to
her
husband
ask
them
to
fill
the
kit
properly
and
i
think
myself
we
will
enjoy
a
little
picnic
so
farrington
went
to
see
about
the
provisions
and
roger
to
get
the
car
ready
while
the
ladies
sauntered
about
the
piazza
the
route
of
their
journey
lay
along
the
shore
of
long
island
sound
and
the
hotel
where
they
had
stayed
over
night
was
not
far
from
new
haven
and
quite
near
the
water
edge
patty
was
very
fond
of
the
water
and
gazed
with
delight
at
the
sparkling
sound
dotted
with
white
steamers
and
various
sorts
of
for
her
part
she
would
have
been
glad
to
stay
longer
at
this
hotel
but
the
warners
whom
they
were
going
to
visit
were
expecting
them
to
dinner
that
evening
these
people
patty
knew
lived
in
a
beautiful
country
place
called
pine
branches
which
was
near
springfield
in
massachusetts
patty
did
not
know
the
warners
but
elise
had
assured
her
that
they
were
delightful
people
and
were
prepared
to
give
her
a
warm
welcome
when
the
car
came
to
the
door
the
ladies
were
all
ready
to
continue
the
journey
they
had
again
donned
their
and
though
patty
was
beginning
to
get
used
to
their
appearance
they
still
seemed
to
her
like
a
trio
of
brownies
or
other
queer
beings
as
they
took
their
seats
in
the
car
roger
climbed
to
his
place
touched
a
lever
by
his
side
and
swung
the
car
down
the
drive
with
an
air
of
what
seemed
to
patty
justifiable
pride
the
freshly
cleaned
car
was
so
daintily
spick
and
span
the
day
was
so
perfect
and
the
passengers
in
such
a
gay
and
festive
mood
that
there
was
indeed
reason
for
a
feeling
of
general
satisfaction
away
they
went
at
a
rapid
speed
which
patty
thought
must
be
beyond
the
allowed
limit
but
roger
assured
her
to
the
contrary
for
many
miles
their
course
lay
along
a
fine
road
which
followed
the
shore
of
the
sound
this
delighted
patty
as
she
was
still
able
to
gaze
out
over
the
blue
water
and
at
the
same
time
enjoy
the
wonderful
motion
of
the
car
but
soon
their
course
changed
and
they
turned
inland
on
the
road
to
hartford
patty
was
surprised
at
roger
knowledge
of
the
way
but
the
young
man
was
well
provided
with
road
maps
and
guidebooks
of
which
he
had
made
careful
study
how
beautifully
the
car
goes
said
patty
it
does
make
the
least
fuss
even
on
the
upgrades
you
must
learn
the
vocabulary
patty
said
roger
when
a
machine
goes
smoothly
as
the
fact
is
doing
now
the
proper
expression
is
that
it
runs
sweetly
sweetly
exclaimed
patty
how
silly
it
sounds
like
a
gushing
girl
that
does
matter
said
roger
serenely
if
you
go
on
motor
trips
you
must
learn
to
talk
all
right
said
patty
i
willing
to
learn
and
i
do
think
the
way
this
car
goes
it
is
just
too
sweet
for
anything
they
all
laughed
at
this
but
their
gaiety
was
for
just
then
there
was
a
peculiar
crunching
sound
that
seemed
to
mean
disaster
judging
from
the
expressions
of
dismay
on
the
faces
of
the
farrington
family
what
is
it
asked
patty
forgetting
that
she
had
been
told
never
to
ask
questions
on
such
occasions
patty
said
roger
making
a
comical
face
at
her
my
countenance
now
presents
an
expression
typical
of
disgust
irritation
and
impatience
i
now
wave
my
right
hand
thus
which
is
a
delsarte
gesture
expressing
exasperation
with
a
trace
of
anger
i
next
give
voice
to
my
sentiments
merely
to
remark
in
my
usual
calm
and
disinterested
way
that
a
belt
has
broken
and
the
mending
thereof
will
consume
a
portion
of
time
the
length
of
which
may
be
estimated
only
after
it
has
elapsed
patty
laughed
heartily
at
this
harangue
but
gathered
from
nonsense
the
interesting
fact
that
an
accident
had
occurred
and
that
a
delay
was
inevitable
nobody
seemed
especially
surprised
indeed
they
took
it
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
and
farrington
opened
a
new
magazine
which
she
had
brought
with
her
and
calmly
settled
herself
to
read
but
elise
said
well
i
already
starving
with
hunger
and
i
think
we
may
as
well
open
that
kit
of
provisions
and
have
our
picnic
right
here
while
roger
is
mending
the
belt
elise
said
her
father
jestingly
you
sometimes
show
signs
of
almost
human
intelligence
your
plan
is
a
positive
inspiration
for
i
confess
that
i
myself
feel
the
gnawings
of
hunger
let
us
eat
the
eggs
and
ham
sandwiches
that
we
have
with
us
and
then
if
we
like
we
can
stop
at
hartford
this
afternoon
for
a
more
satisfying
lunch
as
i
begin
to
think
we
will
not
reach
pine
branches
until
sometime
later
than
their
usual
dinner
hour
they
all
agreed
to
this
plan
and
roger
with
his
peculiar
sensitiveness
toward
being
discovered
with
his
car
at
a
disadvantage
said
seriously
i
see
a
racing
machine
coming
and
when
it
passes
us
i
hope
you
people
will
act
as
if
we
had
stopped
here
only
to
lunch
and
not
because
this
ridiculous
belt
chose
to
break
itself
just
now
this
trait
of
roger
amused
patty
very
much
but
she
was
quite
ready
to
humour
her
friend
and
agreed
to
do
her
part
she
looked
where
roger
had
indicated
and
though
she
could
see
what
looked
like
a
black
speck
on
a
distant
road
she
wondered
how
roger
could
know
it
was
a
racing
machine
that
was
approaching
however
she
realised
that
there
were
many
details
of
motoring
of
which
she
had
as
yet
no
idea
and
she
turned
her
attention
to
helping
the
others
spread
out
the
luncheon
the
beautifully
furnished
basket
was
a
delight
to
patty
she
was
amazed
to
see
how
cleverly
a
large
amount
of
paraphernalia
could
be
stowed
in
a
small
amount
of
space
the
kit
was
arranged
for
six
persons
and
contained
of
knives
forks
spoons
and
even
also
plates
cups
napkins
and
everything
with
which
to
serve
a
comfortable
meal
there
were
tea
and
coffee
cans
salt
pepper
and
all
necessary
condiments
then
there
was
the
alcohol
stove
with
its
and
chafing
dish
at
the
sight
of
all
these
things
which
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
kit
as
out
of
a
magician
hat
patty
eyes
danced
let
me
cook
she
begged
and
farrington
and
elise
were
only
too
glad
to
be
relieved
of
this
duty
there
was
much
cooking
to
do
as
sandwiches
cold
meats
salad
and
sweets
were
lavishly
provided
but
patty
made
tea
and
then
boiled
a
few
eggs
just
for
the
fun
of
doing
it
preparations
for
the
picnic
were
scarcely
under
way
when
the
that
roger
had
seen
in
the
distance
came
near
them
there
was
a
whirring
sound
as
it
approached
and
patty
glanced
up
from
her
alcohol
stove
to
see
that
it
was
occupied
by
only
one
man
he
was
slowing
speed
and
evidently
intended
to
stop
long
before
he
had
reached
them
roger
had
hidden
his
tools
and
though
his
work
on
the
broken
belt
was
not
completed
he
busied
himself
with
the
luncheon
preparations
as
if
that
was
his
sole
thought
the
stopped
and
the
man
who
was
driving
it
got
out
at
sight
of
him
patty
with
difficulty
restrained
her
laughter
for
though
their
own
garb
was
queer
it
was
rational
compared
to
the
appearance
of
this
newcomer
a
racing
suit
is
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
a
diver
costume
the
most
dress
a
man
can
get
into
the
stranger
suit
was
of
black
rubber
tightly
strapped
at
the
wrists
and
ankles
but
it
was
his
which
gave
the
man
his
weird
and
uncanny
effect
it
was
a
combination
of
mask
goggles
hood
earflaps
and
neckshield
which
was
so
arranged
with
hinges
that
the
noseguard
and
mouthpiece
worked
independently
of
each
other
at
any
rate
it
seemed
to
patty
the
funniest
show
she
had
ever
seen
and
she
could
help
laughing
the
man
did
seem
to
mind
however
and
after
he
had
bowed
silently
for
a
moment
or
two
with
great
enjoyment
of
their
mystification
he
pulled
off
his
astonishing
and
disclosed
his
features
dick
phelps
exclaimed
farrington
why
how
are
you
old
man
right
down
glad
to
see
you
phelps
was
a
friend
of
the
farrington
family
and
quite
naturally
they
invited
him
to
lunch
with
them
indeed
i
will
said
the
visitor
for
i
started
at
daybreak
and
had
nothing
to
eat
since
i
ca
tarry
long
though
as
i
must
make
new
york
city
phelps
was
a
young
man
of
about
thirty
years
and
so
pleased
was
he
with
patty
efforts
in
the
cooking
line
that
he
ate
all
the
eggs
she
had
boiled
and
drank
nearly
all
the
tea
besides
making
serious
inroads
on
the
viands
they
had
brought
with
them
it
does
matter
if
i
do
eat
up
all
your
food
said
the
young
man
pleasantly
for
you
can
stop
anywhere
and
get
more
but
i
must
stop
again
until
i
reach
the
city
and
i
probably
wo
have
a
chance
to
eat
then
as
i
must
push
on
to
long
island
the
farringtons
were
quite
willing
to
refresh
the
stranger
within
their
gates
and
they
all
enjoyed
the
merry
little
picnic
where
are
you
bound
asked
phelps
as
he
prepared
to
continue
his
way
to
pine
branches
first
said
farrington
the
country
house
of
a
friend
it
near
springfield
and
from
there
we
shall
make
short
trips
and
later
on
continue
our
way
in
some
other
direction
which
way
we
have
yet
decided
good
enough
said
phelps
then
i
probably
see
you
again
i
am
often
a
guest
at
pine
branches
myself
and
shall
hope
to
run
across
you
as
every
motorist
is
necessarily
interested
in
his
friend
car
phelps
naturally
turned
to
inspect
the
farrington
machine
before
getting
into
his
own
and
so
to
roger
chagrin
he
was
obliged
to
admit
that
he
was
even
then
under
the
necessity
of
mending
a
broken
belt
but
to
roger
relief
phelps
took
almost
no
notice
of
it
merely
saying
that
a
detail
defect
was
liable
to
happen
to
anybody
he
looked
over
the
vital
parts
of
the
motor
and
complimented
roger
on
its
fine
condition
this
pleased
the
boy
greatly
and
resuming
his
work
after
phelps
departure
he
patched
up
the
belt
while
the
others
repacked
the
kit
and
soon
they
started
off
again
swiftly
and
smoothly
they
ran
along
over
the
beautiful
roads
occasionally
meeting
other
apparently
as
happy
as
they
were
themselves
sometimes
they
exchanged
merry
greetings
as
they
passed
for
all
motorists
belong
to
one
great
though
unorganised
fraternity
i
already
discovered
that
trifling
accidents
are
a
part
of
the
performance
and
i
also
discovered
that
they
easily
remedied
and
soon
over
and
that
when
they
are
over
they
are
quickly
forgotten
and
it
seems
impossible
that
they
should
ever
occur
again
you
sized
it
up
pretty
fairly
patty
said
roger
and
though
i
never
before
thought
it
out
for
myself
i
agree
with
you
that
that
is
the
true
way
to
look
at
it
on
they
went
leaving
the
miles
behind
them
and
as
roger
was
anxious
to
make
up
for
lost
time
he
went
at
a
slightly
higher
speed
than
he
would
have
otherwise
done
he
slowed
down
however
when
they
passed
horses
or
when
they
went
through
towns
or
villages
patty
was
greatly
interested
in
the
many
small
villages
through
which
they
rode
as
nearly
every
one
showed
quaint
or
humorous
scenes
dogs
would
come
out
and
bark
at
them
children
would
scream
after
them
and
even
the
citizens
of
the
hamlets
would
stare
at
them
as
if
they
had
never
seen
a
before
though
patty
reasoned
that
surely
many
of
them
must
have
travelled
that
same
road
when
you
meet
another
village
roger
she
said
do
go
through
it
more
slowly
for
i
like
to
see
the
funny
people
very
well
said
roger
you
may
stop
and
get
a
drink
at
the
town
pump
if
you
like
no
thank
you
said
patty
i
do
want
to
get
out
but
i
would
like
to
stop
a
minute
or
two
in
one
of
them
roger
would
willingly
have
granted
patty
wish
but
he
was
deprived
of
this
privilege
by
the
car
itself
just
as
they
neared
a
small
settlement
known
as
huntley
corners
another
ominous
sound
from
the
machine
gave
warning
that
belt
again
exclaimed
roger
patty
the
probabilities
are
that
you
have
all
the
time
you
want
to
study
up
this
village
and
even
learn
the
life
history
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
what
an
annoying
belt
it
is
said
farrington
in
her
pleasant
way
do
you
think
roger
dear
that
you
had
better
get
a
new
belt
and
be
done
with
it
that
just
what
i
do
think
mother
but
somehow
i
ca
persuade
myself
that
they
keep
them
for
sale
at
this
corner
grocery
the
car
had
reached
the
only
store
in
the
settlement
and
stopped
almost
in
front
of
it
patty
was
beginning
to
learn
the
different
kinds
of
stops
that
a
can
make
and
she
felt
pretty
sure
that
this
was
not
a
momentary
pause
but
a
stop
that
threatened
a
considerable
delay
she
said
as
much
to
roger
and
he
replied
patty
you
an
apt
pupil
the
fact
has
paused
here
not
for
a
day
but
for
all
time
unless
something
pretty
marvellous
can
be
done
in
the
way
of
belt
mending
patty
began
to
think
that
accidents
were
of
somewhat
frequent
occurrence
but
elise
said
cheerfully
this
seems
to
be
an
off
day
why
sometimes
we
run
sweetly
for
a
week
without
a
word
from
the
belt
do
we
roger
yes
indeed
said
roger
but
patty
may
as
well
get
used
to
the
seamy
side
of
motoring
and
learn
to
like
it
i
do
like
it
declared
patty
and
if
we
are
going
to
take
up
our
abode
here
for
the
present
i
going
out
to
explore
the
town
she
jumped
lightly
from
the
car
and
accompanied
by
elise
strolled
down
the
main
and
indeed
the
only
street
of
the
village
chapter
xii
old
china
a
few
doors
away
from
the
country
store
in
front
of
which
the
automobile
stood
the
girls
saw
a
quaint
old
house
with
a
few
toys
and
candies
displayed
for
sale
in
a
front
window
is
it
funny
said
elise
looking
in
at
the
unattractive
collection
see
that
doll
and
just
look
at
that
funny
yes
said
patty
whose
quick
eye
had
caught
sight
of
something
more
interesting
but
just
look
at
that
plate
of
peppermint
candies
the
plate
i
mean
why
elise
it
a
millennium
plate
what
that
said
elise
looking
blank
a
millennium
plate
why
elise
it
about
the
most
valuable
bit
of
old
china
there
is
in
this
country
why
nan
would
go
raving
crazy
over
that
i
rather
take
it
home
to
her
than
any
present
i
could
buy
in
the
city
shop
elise
do
you
suppose
whoever
keeps
this
little
store
would
sell
that
plate
no
harm
in
trying
said
elise
there
plenty
of
time
for
it
will
take
roger
half
an
hour
to
fix
that
belt
let
go
in
and
ask
her
no
no
said
patty
that
is
the
way
wait
a
minute
i
been
china
hunting
before
with
nan
and
with
other
people
and
you
must
go
about
it
like
that
we
must
go
in
as
if
we
were
going
to
buy
some
of
her
other
goods
and
then
we
work
around
to
the
plate
by
degrees
you
buy
something
else
elise
and
leave
the
plate
part
to
me
very
well
i
think
i
buy
that
rag
doll
though
i
sure
i
do
know
what
i
ever
do
with
it
no
child
would
accept
it
as
a
gift
well
buy
something
said
patty
as
they
went
in
the
opening
of
the
door
caused
a
big
bell
to
jingle
and
this
apparently
called
an
old
woman
in
from
the
back
room
she
was
not
very
tidy
but
she
was
a
body
and
smiled
pleasantly
at
the
two
girls
what
is
it
young
ladies
she
asked
can
i
sell
you
anything
yes
said
elise
gravely
i
was
passing
your
window
and
i
noticed
a
doll
there
that
one
with
the
blue
gingham
dress
how
much
is
it
please
that
one
said
the
old
lady
is
fifty
cents
seems
sorter
high
i
know
but
that
doll
was
made
by
a
blind
girl
that
lives
a
piece
up
the
road
and
though
the
sewin
ai
very
good
it
a
wonder
that
she
can
do
it
at
all
and
them
dolls
is
her
only
support
and
land
knows
she
do
sell
hardly
any
i
give
you
a
dollar
for
it
said
elise
impulsively
for
her
generous
heart
was
touched
have
you
any
more
of
them
no
said
the
woman
in
some
amazement
malviny
she
do
make
many
they
do
sell
very
rapid
but
be
you
goin
her
way
she
might
have
one
to
home
purty
nigh
finished
i
do
know
said
elise
where
does
she
live
straight
along
on
the
main
road
you
ca
miss
it
an
old
yaller
house
with
the
back
burnt
off
it
was
patty
turn
now
and
she
said
she
would
buy
the
peppermint
candies
that
were
in
the
window
all
of
asked
the
storekeeper
in
surprise
yes
said
patty
all
of
them
and
as
the
old
woman
lifted
the
plate
in
from
the
window
patty
added
and
if
you
care
to
part
with
it
buy
the
plate
too
land
miss
that
old
plate
ai
no
good
it
got
a
crack
in
it
but
if
so
be
you
admire
that
pattern
i
got
another
in
the
that
just
like
it
only
cracked
even
chipped
would
you
care
to
part
with
them
both
asked
patty
remembering
that
this
phrase
was
the
preferred
formula
of
all
china
hunters
laws
yes
miss
if
you
care
to
pay
for
of
course
i
ca
sell
for
nothin
for
there
sometimes
ladies
as
comes
here
as
has
a
fancy
to
them
old
things
but
these
two
plates
is
so
humbly
that
i
did
have
the
face
to
show
to
anybody
as
was
lookin
for
anteeks
patty
sense
of
honesty
would
not
allow
her
to
ignore
the
old
mistake
they
may
seem
homely
to
you
she
said
but
i
think
it
only
right
to
tell
you
that
these
plates
are
probably
the
most
valuable
of
any
you
have
ever
owned
well
for
the
land
o
goodness
ef
you
ai
honest
many
as
would
speak
up
like
that
jest
come
in
the
back
room
and
look
at
the
other
plate
the
girls
followed
the
old
woman
as
she
raised
a
calico
curtain
of
a
flowered
pattern
and
let
them
through
into
the
there
she
said
with
some
pride
as
she
took
down
a
plate
from
the
high
mantel
there
you
can
see
for
yourself
there
ai
no
chip
or
crack
into
it
sure
enough
patty
held
in
her
hand
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
millennium
plate
so
highly
prized
by
collectors
and
there
was
also
the
one
she
had
seen
in
the
window
which
though
slightly
cracked
was
still
in
fair
condition
how
much
do
you
want
for
them
asked
patty
the
old
woman
hesitated
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
although
she
wanted
to
get
as
high
a
price
as
possible
for
her
plates
yet
she
did
not
want
to
ask
so
much
that
patty
would
refuse
to
take
them
you
tell
me
she
said
insinuatingly
what
you
think
them
plates
is
worth
no
said
patty
firmly
i
never
buy
things
that
way
you
tell
me
your
price
and
then
i
will
buy
them
or
not
as
i
choose
well
said
the
old
woman
slowly
the
last
lady
that
i
sold
plates
to
she
give
me
fifty
cents
apiece
for
three
of
and
though
i
think
they
was
purtier
than
these
here
yet
you
tell
me
these
is
more
vallyble
and
so
here
the
old
woman
made
a
great
show
of
firmness
and
so
my
price
for
these
plates
is
a
dollar
apiece
as
soon
as
she
had
said
it
she
looked
at
patty
in
alarm
greatly
fearing
that
she
would
not
pay
so
much
but
patty
replied
i
will
give
you
five
dollars
for
the
two
because
i
know
that
is
nearer
their
value
than
the
price
you
set
bless
your
good
heart
and
your
purty
face
miss
said
the
old
woman
as
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
i
that
obliged
to
you
i
send
the
money
straight
to
my
son
john
he
in
the
hospital
poor
chap
and
he
needs
it
sore
elise
had
rarely
been
brought
in
contact
with
poverty
and
want
and
her
generous
heart
was
touched
at
once
she
emptied
her
little
purse
out
upon
the
table
and
was
rejoiced
to
discover
that
it
contained
something
over
ten
dollars
please
accept
that
she
cried
to
buy
things
for
your
son
or
for
yourself
as
you
choose
illustration
you
can
see
for
yourself
there
ai
no
chip
or
crack
into
it
the
old
woman
was
quite
overcome
at
this
kindness
and
was
endeavouring
brokenly
to
express
her
thanks
when
the
bell
on
the
shop
door
jangled
loudly
patty
being
nearest
to
the
calico
curtain
drew
it
aside
to
find
roger
in
the
little
shop
looking
very
breathless
and
worried
well
of
all
things
he
exclaimed
you
girls
have
given
us
a
scare
we
hunted
high
and
low
through
the
whole
of
this
metropolis
and
if
it
had
been
that
a
little
girl
said
she
saw
you
come
in
here
i
suppose
we
now
be
dragging
the
brook
come
along
quick
we
all
ready
to
start
how
could
you
get
that
belt
mended
so
quickly
asked
elise
never
mind
that
said
roger
just
come
along
wait
a
minute
said
patty
hastily
gathering
up
her
precious
plates
while
the
old
woman
provided
some
newspaper
wrapping
roger
hurried
the
two
girls
back
to
the
saying
as
they
went
we
not
in
any
hurry
to
start
but
mother
thinks
you
drowned
and
i
want
to
prove
to
her
that
she
is
mistaken
the
sight
of
the
car
caused
patty
to
go
off
into
peals
of
laughter
in
front
of
the
beautiful
machine
was
an
old
farm
wagon
and
in
front
of
that
were
four
horses
on
the
seat
of
the
wagon
sat
a
farmer
who
seemed
to
take
little
interest
in
the
proceedings
i
would
ask
what
the
matter
for
anything
said
patty
looking
at
roger
demurely
but
i
suppose
i
am
safe
in
assuming
that
you
have
those
horses
there
merely
because
you
think
they
look
well
that
it
said
roger
nothing
adds
to
the
good
effect
of
a
like
having
a
few
fine
horses
attached
to
it
jump
in
girls
the
girls
jumped
in
and
the
caravan
started
it
was
at
a
decidedly
different
rate
of
speed
from
the
way
they
had
travelled
before
but
patty
soon
learned
that
roger
had
found
it
impossible
to
fix
the
belt
without
going
to
a
repair
shop
and
there
was
none
nearer
than
hartford
with
some
difficulty
and
at
considerable
expense
he
had
persuaded
the
gruff
old
farmer
to
tow
them
over
the
intervening
ten
miles
patty
would
have
supposed
that
this
would
greatly
humiliate
the
proud
and
sensitive
boy
but
to
her
surprise
roger
treated
the
affair
as
a
good
joke
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
apparently
pleased
with
his
enforced
idleness
and
chatted
merrily
as
they
slowly
crawled
along
occasionally
he
would
plead
with
the
old
farmer
to
urge
his
horses
a
trifle
faster
and
even
hint
at
certain
rewards
if
they
should
reach
hartford
in
a
given
time
but
the
grumpy
old
man
was
proof
against
coaxing
or
even
bribing
and
they
jogged
along
almost
at
a
snail
pace
perceiving
that
there
was
no
way
of
improving
the
situation
roger
gave
up
trying
and
turning
partly
around
in
his
seat
proceeded
to
entertain
the
girls
to
the
best
of
his
ability
patty
had
known
before
what
a
jolly
boy
elise
brother
was
and
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
a
good
sense
of
proportion
to
be
able
to
take
things
so
easily
and
to
keep
his
temper
under
such
trying
circumstances
only
once
did
the
surly
old
farmer
address
himself
to
his
employers
turning
around
to
face
the
occupants
of
the
he
bawled
out
whar
do
ye
wanter
go
in
hartford
to
the
largest
repair
shop
for
automobiles
answered
roger
thought
ye
wanted
ter
go
ter
the
state
insane
asylum
was
the
response
to
this
and
a
suppressed
chuckle
could
be
heard
as
the
old
man
again
turned
his
attention
to
his
not
steeds
though
not
a
very
subtle
jest
this
greatly
amused
the
motor
party
and
soon
they
entered
the
outskirts
of
the
beautiful
city
of
hartford
farrington
looked
at
his
watch
i
suppose
he
said
it
will
take
the
best
part
of
an
hour
to
have
the
machine
attended
to
for
there
are
two
or
three
little
matters
which
i
want
to
have
put
in
order
besides
the
belt
i
will
stay
and
look
after
it
and
the
rest
of
you
can
take
your
choice
of
two
proceedings
one
is
to
go
to
a
hotel
rest
and
freshen
yourselves
up
a
bit
and
have
some
luncheon
the
other
is
to
take
a
carriage
and
drive
around
the
city
hartford
is
a
beautiful
place
and
if
patty
has
never
seen
it
i
am
sure
she
will
enjoy
it
it
does
matter
to
me
said
farrington
which
we
do
but
quite
sure
i
do
care
to
eat
anything
more
just
at
present
we
had
our
picnic
not
so
very
long
ago
you
know
i
know
said
farrington
but
consider
this
when
we
start
from
here
with
the
car
in
good
order
i
hope
to
run
straight
through
to
warner
but
at
best
we
can
not
reach
there
before
ten
so
it
really
advisable
that
you
should
fortify
yourselves
against
the
long
ride
for
i
should
hate
to
delay
matters
further
by
stopping
again
for
dinner
ten
exclaimed
farrington
why
they
expect
us
by
seven
at
latest
it
is
too
bad
to
keep
them
waiting
like
that
ca
we
telephone
to
them
yes
said
farrington
and
i
will
attend
to
that
while
i
am
waiting
for
the
car
to
be
fixed
now
what
would
you
people
rather
do
both
the
girls
declared
they
could
not
eat
another
luncheon
at
present
and
they
thought
it
would
be
delightful
to
drive
around
and
see
the
town
so
farrington
settled
the
matter
by
deciding
to
take
the
drive
and
then
she
said
we
can
leave
the
at
some
hotel
to
be
filled
then
we
can
pick
it
up
again
and
take
it
along
with
us
and
when
we
get
hungry
we
can
eat
a
light
supper
in
the
car
great
head
mother
cried
roger
you
are
truly
a
genius
an
open
landau
was
engaged
and
roger
and
the
three
ladies
started
for
the
drive
they
spent
a
delightful
hour
viewing
the
points
of
interest
in
the
city
which
the
obliging
driver
pointed
out
to
them
they
smiled
when
they
came
to
the
insane
asylum
and
though
the
grounds
looked
attractive
they
concluded
not
to
go
there
to
stay
even
though
their
old
farmer
friend
had
seemed
to
think
it
an
appropriate
place
for
them
it
a
strange
thing
said
roger
that
people
who
do
not
ride
in
automobiles
always
think
that
people
who
do
are
crazy
i
sure
i
know
why
i
would
blame
anybody
for
thinking
phelps
crazy
if
they
had
seen
him
this
morning
said
patty
that
only
because
you
not
accustomed
to
seeing
men
in
racing
costume
said
roger
after
you
seen
a
few
more
rigs
like
that
you
wo
think
anything
of
them
that
so
said
patty
thoughtfully
and
if
i
had
never
before
seen
a
farmer
in
the
queer
overalls
and
big
straw
hat
that
our
old
country
gentleman
wore
i
daresay
i
should
have
thought
his
appearance
quite
as
crazy
as
that
of
mr
phelps
you
have
a
logical
mind
patty
said
farrington
and
on
the
whole
i
think
you
are
right
chapter
xiii
a
stormy
ride
the
time
passed
quickly
and
soon
the
drive
was
over
and
after
calling
for
their
the
quartet
returned
to
the
repair
shop
to
find
farrington
all
ready
to
start
so
into
the
car
they
all
bundled
and
patty
learned
that
each
fresh
start
during
a
motor
journey
revives
the
same
feeling
of
delight
that
is
felt
at
the
beginning
of
the
trip
she
settled
herself
in
her
place
with
a
little
sigh
of
contentment
and
remarked
that
she
had
already
begun
to
feel
at
home
in
the
fact
and
she
only
wished
it
was
early
morning
and
they
were
starting
for
the
day
instead
of
but
for
a
few
hours
do
you
worry
my
lady
said
roger
as
he
laid
his
hands
lightly
on
the
you
a
good
many
solid
hours
of
travel
ahead
of
you
right
now
it
four
and
if
we
reach
pine
branches
by
ten
i
will
pat
this
old
car
fondly
on
the
head
before
i
put
her
to
bed
the
next
few
hours
were
perhaps
the
pleasantest
they
had
yet
spent
in
june
from
four
to
seven
is
a
delightful
time
and
as
the
roads
were
perfect
and
the
car
went
along
without
the
slightest
jar
or
jolt
and
without
even
a
hint
of
an
accident
of
any
sort
there
was
really
not
a
flaw
to
mar
their
pleasure
as
the
sun
set
and
the
twilight
began
to
close
around
them
patty
thought
she
had
never
seen
anything
more
beautiful
than
the
landscape
spread
out
before
them
a
broad
white
road
stretched
ahead
like
a
ribbon
on
either
side
were
sometimes
green
fields
darkening
in
the
fading
light
and
sometimes
small
groves
of
trees
which
stood
black
against
the
sky
then
the
sunset
colours
faded
the
trees
grew
blacker
and
denser
and
their
shadows
ceased
to
fall
across
the
darkening
road
roger
lighted
the
lamps
and
drew
out
extra
fur
robes
for
the
evening
air
was
growing
chill
is
it
wonderful
said
patty
almost
in
a
whisper
motoring
by
daylight
is
gay
and
festive
but
now
to
glide
along
so
swiftly
and
silently
through
the
darkness
is
so
strange
that
it
almost
solemn
as
it
grows
darker
and
blacker
it
seems
as
if
we
were
gliding
away
away
into
eternity
for
gracious
sake
child
said
farrington
do
talk
like
that
you
give
me
the
shivers
say
something
more
lively
quick
patty
laughed
merrily
that
was
only
a
passing
mood
she
said
really
i
think
it
awfully
jolly
for
us
to
be
scooting
along
like
this
with
our
lamps
shining
we
just
like
a
great
big
or
a
dancing
you
have
a
imagination
patty
said
farrington
laughing
at
the
girl
quick
change
from
grave
to
gay
you
can
make
it
obey
your
will
ca
you
yes
said
patty
demurely
what
the
use
of
having
an
imagination
if
you
ca
make
it
work
for
you
the
car
was
comfortably
lighted
inside
as
well
as
out
with
electric
lamps
and
the
occupants
were
as
farrington
said
as
cozy
and
homelike
as
if
they
were
in
a
gipsy
waggon
patty
laughed
at
the
comparison
and
said
she
thought
that
very
few
gipsy
waggons
had
the
luxuries
and
modern
appliances
of
the
fact
that
may
be
said
farrington
but
you
must
admit
the
gipsy
waggon
is
the
more
picturesque
vehicle
the
way
they
shirr
that
calico
arrangement
around
their
back
door
has
long
been
my
admiration
it
is
beautiful
said
patty
and
the
way
the
comes
out
of
the
roof
and
the
children
heads
out
anywhere
added
elise
yes
certainly
picturesque
speaking
of
gipsy
waggons
makes
me
hungry
said
farrington
what
time
is
it
and
how
soon
shall
we
reach
the
warners
it
after
eight
my
dear
said
her
husband
and
i
sure
we
ca
get
there
before
ten
and
then
of
course
we
wo
have
dinner
at
once
so
do
let
us
partake
of
a
little
light
refreshment
seems
to
me
we
are
always
eating
said
patty
but
i
free
to
confess
that
i
about
as
hungry
as
a
full
grown
anaconda
without
reducing
their
speed
and
they
were
going
fairly
fast
the
tourists
indulged
in
a
picnic
luncheon
there
was
no
tea
making
but
sandwiches
and
little
cakes
and
glasses
of
milk
were
gratefully
accepted
this
is
all
very
well
said
farrington
after
supper
was
over
and
i
would
for
a
moment
have
you
think
that
i
tired
or
frightened
or
the
least
mite
timid
but
if
i
may
have
my
way
hereafter
we
make
no
definite
promises
to
be
at
any
particular
place
at
any
particular
time
i
wish
when
you
had
telephoned
john
you
had
told
the
warners
that
we
would
arrive
until
then
we
could
have
stopped
somewhere
and
spent
the
night
like
civilised
beings
instead
of
doing
this
gipsy
act
it
would
have
been
a
good
idea
said
farrington
thoughtfully
but
it
a
bit
too
late
now
so
there
no
use
worrying
about
it
but
cheer
up
my
friend
i
think
we
arrive
shortly
i
think
we
wo
said
roger
i
do
want
to
be
discouraging
but
we
have
passed
the
old
stone
quarry
yet
and
that
a
mighty
long
way
this
side
of
pine
branches
you
sure
you
know
the
way
are
you
roger
asked
his
mother
her
tone
betraying
the
first
trace
of
anxiety
she
had
yet
shown
oh
yes
said
roger
and
patty
was
sure
whether
she
imagined
it
or
whether
the
boy
answer
was
not
quite
as
positive
as
it
was
meant
to
sound
well
i
glad
you
do
said
farrington
for
i
confess
i
do
we
doubtless
on
the
right
road
but
i
have
as
yet
seen
any
familiar
landmarks
we
on
the
right
road
all
right
said
roger
you
know
there
a
long
stretch
this
side
of
pine
branches
without
any
villages
at
all
i
know
it
said
farrington
but
it
is
dotted
with
large
country
places
and
farms
are
you
passing
those
roger
i
ca
seem
to
see
any
i
have
noticed
very
many
mother
but
i
think
we
have
come
to
them
yet
chirk
up
it
quite
some
distance
yet
but
we
keep
going
till
we
get
there
oh
said
farrington
what
if
the
belt
should
break
or
something
give
way
do
think
of
such
things
mother
nothing
is
going
to
give
way
but
if
it
should
why
we
just
sit
here
till
morning
and
then
we
can
see
to
fix
it
farrington
could
help
laughing
at
roger
good
nature
but
she
said
of
course
i
know
everything
all
right
and
truly
i
not
a
bit
frightened
but
somehow
john
i
feel
more
comfortable
if
you
come
back
here
with
me
and
let
one
of
the
girls
sit
in
front
in
your
place
certainly
said
her
husband
hop
over
here
elise
let
me
go
cried
patty
who
somehow
felt
intuitively
that
elise
would
prefer
to
stay
behind
with
her
parents
as
for
patty
herself
she
had
no
fear
and
really
wanted
the
exciting
experience
of
sitting
up
in
front
during
this
wild
night
ride
roger
stopped
the
car
and
the
change
was
soon
effected
as
patty
insisted
upon
it
she
was
allowed
to
go
instead
of
elise
and
in
a
moment
they
were
off
again
do
you
know
said
patty
to
roger
after
they
had
started
when
i
got
out
then
i
felt
two
or
three
drops
of
rain
i
do
know
it
said
roger
in
a
low
tone
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
patty
that
there
going
to
be
a
hard
storm
before
long
certainly
before
we
reach
pine
branches
how
dreadful
said
patty
who
was
awed
more
by
the
anxious
note
in
roger
voice
than
by
the
thought
of
the
rain
storm
do
you
think
it
would
be
better
she
went
on
hoping
to
make
a
helpful
suggestion
if
we
should
put
in
to
some
house
until
the
storm
is
over
surely
anybody
would
give
us
shelter
i
do
see
any
houses
said
roger
and
patty
i
may
as
well
own
up
we
off
the
road
somehow
i
think
i
must
have
taken
the
wrong
turning
at
that
fork
a
few
miles
back
and
though
i
not
quite
sure
yet
i
feel
a
growing
conviction
that
we
lost
although
the
situation
was
appalling
for
some
unexplainable
reason
patty
could
help
giggling
lost
she
exclaimed
in
a
tragic
whisper
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
a
desolate
country
region
and
a
storm
coming
on
patty
dramatic
summary
of
the
situation
made
roger
laugh
too
and
their
peals
of
gaiety
reassured
the
three
who
sat
behind
what
are
you
laughing
at
said
elise
i
wish
you
tell
me
for
scared
to
death
and
roger
it
beginning
to
rain
you
do
say
so
said
roger
in
a
tone
of
polite
surprise
why
then
we
must
put
on
the
curtains
he
stopped
the
car
and
jumping
down
from
his
place
began
to
arrange
the
curtains
which
were
always
carried
in
case
of
rain
farrington
helped
him
and
as
he
did
so
remarked
looks
like
something
of
a
storm
my
boy
father
said
roger
in
a
low
voice
it
going
to
rain
cats
and
dogs
and
there
may
be
a
few
thunders
and
lightnings
i
hope
mother
wo
have
hysterics
and
i
do
believe
she
will
if
you
sit
by
her
and
hold
her
hand
i
do
think
we
better
stop
i
think
we
better
drive
straight
ahead
but
dad
i
believe
we
on
the
wrong
road
we
not
lost
i
know
the
way
all
right
but
to
go
around
the
way
we
are
going
is
about
forty
miles
farther
than
the
way
i
meant
to
go
and
yet
i
do
dare
turn
back
and
try
to
get
on
the
other
road
again
for
fear
i
really
get
lost
roger
said
farrington
you
a
chauffeur
and
give
you
a
reference
whenever
you
want
one
but
i
must
admit
that
you
have
succeeded
in
getting
us
into
a
pretty
mess
roger
was
grateful
enough
for
the
light
way
in
which
his
father
treated
the
rather
serious
situation
but
the
boy
keenly
felt
his
responsibility
good
old
dad
he
said
you
a
brick
get
in
back
now
and
look
after
mother
and
elise
do
let
them
shoot
me
or
anything
when
i
not
looking
patty
is
a
little
trump
she
is
plucky
clear
through
and
i
am
glad
to
have
her
up
in
front
with
me
now
i
do
the
best
i
can
and
drive
straight
through
the
storm
if
i
see
any
sort
of
a
place
where
we
can
turn
in
for
shelter
i
think
we
better
do
it
do
you
i
do
indeed
said
his
father
meantime
my
boy
go
ahead
i
trust
the
whole
matter
to
you
for
you
a
more
expert
driver
than
i
am
it
was
already
raining
fast
as
the
two
men
again
climbed
into
the
car
but
the
curtains
all
around
kept
the
travellers
dry
and
with
its
cheery
lights
the
interior
of
the
car
was
cozy
and
pleasant
in
front
was
a
curtain
with
a
large
window
of
mica
which
gave
ample
view
of
the
road
ahead
with
his
strong
and
lights
roger
had
no
fear
of
collision
and
as
they
were
well
protected
from
the
rain
his
chief
worriment
was
because
they
were
on
the
wrong
road
it
miles
and
miles
longer
to
go
around
this
way
he
confided
to
patty
i
do
know
what
time
we
ever
get
there
never
mind
said
patty
who
wanted
to
cheer
him
up
i
think
this
is
a
great
experience
i
suppose
there
danger
but
somehow
i
ca
help
enjoying
the
wild
excitement
of
it
i
glad
you
like
it
said
roger
a
little
grimly
i
always
pleased
to
entertain
my
guests
the
storm
was
increasing
and
now
amounted
to
a
gale
the
rain
dashed
against
the
curtains
in
great
wet
sheets
and
finally
forced
its
way
in
at
a
few
of
the
crevices
farrington
sitting
between
her
husband
and
daughter
was
thoroughly
frightened
and
extremely
uncomfortable
but
she
pluckily
refrained
from
giving
way
to
her
nervousness
and
succeeded
in
behaving
herself
with
real
bravery
and
courage
still
the
tempest
grew
so
wildly
did
it
dash
against
the
front
curtain
that
patty
and
roger
could
see
scarcely
a
foot
before
the
machine
there
one
comfort
said
roger
through
his
clenched
teeth
we
not
in
danger
of
running
into
anything
for
no
other
fools
would
be
abroad
such
a
night
as
this
patty
i
going
to
speed
her
i
going
to
race
the
storm
do
said
patty
who
was
wrought
up
to
a
tense
pitch
of
excitement
by
the
war
of
the
elements
without
and
the
novelty
of
the
situation
within
roger
increased
the
speed
and
they
flew
through
the
black
night
and
dashed
into
the
pouring
rain
while
patty
held
her
breath
and
wondered
what
would
happen
next
on
they
went
and
on
patty
imagination
kept
pace
with
her
experiences
and
through
her
mind
flitted
visions
of
tam
ride
john
gilpin
ride
and
the
ride
of
collins
graves
but
all
of
these
seemed
tame
affairs
beside
their
own
speed
through
the
wild
night
roger
said
his
mother
roger
wo
you
please
ask
her
not
to
speak
to
me
just
now
patty
please
said
the
boy
in
such
a
tense
strained
voice
that
patty
was
frightened
at
last
but
she
knew
that
if
roger
were
frightened
that
was
a
special
reason
for
her
own
calmness
and
bravery
turning
slightly
she
said
please
do
speak
to
him
just
now
farrington
he
wants
to
put
all
his
attention
on
his
steering
very
well
said
farrington
who
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
there
was
any
cause
for
alarm
aside
from
the
discomfort
of
the
storm
i
only
wanted
to
tell
him
to
watch
out
for
railroad
trains
and
then
patty
realised
that
that
was
just
what
roger
was
looking
out
for
she
could
not
see
ahead
into
the
blinding
rain
but
she
knew
they
were
going
down
hill
she
heard
what
seemed
like
the
distant
whistle
of
a
locomotive
and
suddenly
realising
that
roger
could
not
stop
the
car
and
must
cross
the
track
before
the
train
came
she
thought
at
the
same
moment
that
if
farrington
should
impulsively
reach
over
and
grasp
the
boy
arm
or
anything
like
that
it
might
mean
terrible
disaster
acting
upon
a
quick
impulse
to
prevent
this
she
turned
round
herself
and
with
a
voice
whose
calmness
surprised
her
she
said
please
farrington
could
you
get
me
a
sandwich
out
of
the
basket
bless
you
no
child
said
that
lady
her
attention
instantly
diverted
by
patty
ruse
that
is
i
do
believe
i
can
but
i
try
patty
was
far
from
wanting
a
sandwich
but
she
felt
that
she
had
at
least
averted
the
possible
danger
of
farrington
suddenly
clutching
roger
and
as
she
turned
back
to
face
the
front
the
great
car
whizzed
across
the
slippery
railroad
track
just
as
patty
saw
the
headlight
of
a
locomotive
not
two
hundred
feet
away
from
them
oh
roger
she
breathed
clasping
her
hands
tightly
lest
she
herself
should
touch
the
boy
and
so
interfere
with
his
steering
it
all
right
patty
said
roger
in
a
breathless
voice
and
as
she
looked
at
his
white
face
she
realised
the
danger
they
had
so
narrowly
escaped
those
in
the
back
seat
could
not
see
the
train
and
the
roar
of
the
storm
drowned
its
noise
patty
said
roger
very
softly
you
saved
us
i
understood
just
what
you
did
i
felt
mother
was
going
to
grab
at
me
when
she
heard
that
whistle
it
a
way
she
has
when
she
nervous
or
frightened
and
i
ca
seem
to
make
her
stop
it
but
you
saved
the
day
with
your
sandwich
trick
and
if
ever
we
get
in
out
of
the
rain
i
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
chapter
xiv
pine
branches
there
were
still
many
miles
to
cover
before
they
reached
their
destination
but
there
were
no
more
railroad
tracks
to
cross
and
as
there
was
little
danger
of
meeting
anyone
roger
let
the
car
fly
along
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
the
storm
continued
and
though
the
party
endeavoured
to
keep
cheerful
yet
the
situation
was
depressing
and
each
found
it
difficult
not
to
show
it
roger
of
course
devoted
his
exclusive
attention
to
driving
the
car
and
patty
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
lest
she
should
disturb
him
in
some
way
the
three
on
the
back
seat
became
rather
silent
also
and
at
last
everybody
was
rejoiced
when
roger
said
those
lights
ahead
are
at
the
entrance
gate
of
pine
branches
then
the
whole
party
waxed
cheerful
again
farrington
looked
at
his
watch
it
quarter
of
two
he
said
do
you
suppose
we
can
get
in
at
this
hour
indeed
we
will
get
in
declared
roger
if
i
have
to
drive
this
car
smash
through
the
gates
and
in
at
the
front
door
the
strain
was
beginning
to
tell
on
the
boy
who
had
really
had
a
fearful
night
of
it
and
he
went
dashing
up
to
the
large
gates
with
a
feeling
of
great
relief
that
the
end
of
the
journey
was
at
hand
when
they
reached
the
entrance
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
torrents
great
lanterns
hung
either
side
of
the
portal
and
disclosed
the
fact
that
the
gates
were
shut
and
locked
roger
had
expected
this
for
he
felt
sure
the
warners
had
long
ago
given
up
all
thought
of
seeing
their
guests
that
night
repeated
soundings
of
the
horn
failed
to
bring
any
response
from
the
and
roger
was
just
about
to
get
out
of
the
car
and
ring
the
bell
at
the
large
door
when
patty
quick
eye
discerned
a
faint
light
at
one
of
the
windows
sure
enough
said
roger
as
she
called
his
attention
to
this
and
after
a
few
moments
the
large
door
was
opened
and
the
porter
gazed
out
into
the
storm
all
right
sir
all
right
he
called
seeing
the
car
and
donning
a
great
raincoat
he
came
out
to
open
the
gates
well
well
sir
he
said
as
farrington
leaned
out
to
speak
with
him
this
is
a
night
sure
enough
warner
sir
he
gave
up
looking
for
you
at
midnight
i
do
wonder
said
farrington
and
now
my
man
can
you
ring
your
people
up
and
is
there
anybody
to
take
care
of
the
car
yes
sir
yes
sir
said
the
porter
just
you
drive
on
up
to
the
house
and
i
go
back
to
the
lodge
and
ring
up
the
chauffeur
and
as
soon
as
he
can
get
around
he
take
care
of
your
car
i
ring
up
the
housekeeper
too
but
she
a
slow
old
body
and
you
best
sound
your
horn
all
the
way
up
the
drive
roger
acted
on
this
advice
and
the
fact
went
tooting
up
the
driveway
and
finally
came
to
a
standstill
at
the
front
entrance
of
pine
branches
they
were
under
a
and
as
soon
as
they
stopped
elise
jumped
out
and
began
a
vigorous
onslaught
on
the
doorbell
roger
kept
the
horn
sounding
and
after
a
few
moments
the
door
was
opened
by
a
somewhat
butler
as
they
entered
warner
whose
appearance
gave
evidence
of
a
hasty
toilet
came
flying
down
the
staircase
three
steps
at
a
time
well
well
my
friends
he
exclaimed
i
glad
to
see
you
i
am
overjoyed
to
see

were
expecting
you
just
at
this
particular
minute
and
i
am
so
glad
that
you
arrived
on
time
how

it
how
do

patty
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
roger
my
boy
you
look
exhausted
has
your
car
been
cutting
up
jinks
as
warner
talked
he
bustled
around
shaking
hands
with
his
guests
assisting
them
out
of
their
wraps
and
disposing
of
them
in
comfortable
chairs
meantime
the
rest
of
the
family
appeared
bertha
warner
a
girl
of
about
patty
age
came
flying
downstairs
pinning
her
collar
as
she
ran
how
jolly
of
you
she
cried
to
come
in
the
middle
of
the
night
such
fun
i
so
glad
to
see
you
elise
and
this
is
patty
fairfield
patty
i
think
you
lovely
the
impulsive
bertha
kissed
patty
on
both
cheeks
and
then
turned
to
make
way
for
her
mother
warner
was
as
merry
and
as
hearty
in
her
welcome
as
the
others
she
acted
as
if
it
were
an
ordinary
occurrence
to
be
wakened
from
sleep
at
two
in
the
morning
to
greet
newly
arrived
guests
and
she
greeted
patty
quite
as
warmly
as
the
others
suddenly
a
wild
whoop
was
heard
and
winthrop
warner
the
son
of
the
house
came
running
downstairs
jolly
old
crowd
he
cried
you
would
let
a
little
thing
like
a
tornado
stop
your
progress
would
you
i
glad
you
persevered
and
reached
here
even
though
a
trifle
late
winthrop
was
a
athletic
young
man
of
perhaps
and
though
he
chaffed
roger
merrily
he
greeted
the
ladies
with
hospitable
courtesy
and
looked
about
to
see
what
he
could
do
for
their
further
comfort
they
were
still
in
the
great
square
entrance
hall
which
was
one
of
the
most
attractive
rooms
at
pine
branches
a
huge
corner
fireplace
showed
the
charred
logs
of
a
fire
which
had
only
recently
gone
out
and
winthrop
rapidly
twisted
up
some
paper
which
he
lighted
and
procuring
a
few
small
sticks
soon
had
a
crackling
blaze
you
must
be
damp
and
chilly
he
said
and
a
little
fire
will
thaw
you
out
mother
will
you
get
something
ready
for
a
feast
we
should
have
waited
dinner
began
warner
and
we
did
wait
until
after
ten
and
then
we
gave
you
up
it
nearer
time
for
breakfast
than
for
dinner
said
elise
i
do
want
breakfast
declared
roger
i
do
like
that
meal
anyway
no
shredded
whisk
brooms
for
me
we
have
a
nondescript
meal
said
warner
gaily
and
each
one
may
call
it
by
whatever
name
he
chooses
in
a
short
time
they
were
all
invited
to
the
and
found
the
table
filled
with
a
variety
of
delicious
viands
such
a
merry
tableful
of
people
as
partook
of
the
feast
the
warners
seemed
to
enjoy
the
fact
that
their
guests
arrived
at
such
an
unconventional
hour
and
the
farrington
party
were
so
glad
to
have
reached
their
destination
safely
that
they
were
in
the
highest
of
spirits
of
course
the
details
of
the
trip
had
to
be
explained
and
roger
was
unmercifully
chaffed
by
winthrop
and
his
father
for
having
taken
the
wrong
road
but
so
did
the
boy
take
the
teasing
and
so
successfully
did
he
pretend
that
he
came
around
that
way
merely
for
the
purpose
of
extending
a
pleasant
tour
that
he
got
the
best
of
them
after
all
at
last
warner
declared
that
people
who
had
been
through
such
thrilling
experiences
must
be
in
immediate
need
of
rest
and
she
gave
orders
that
they
must
all
start
for
bed
forthwith
it
is
needless
to
say
that
breakfast
was
not
early
next
morning
nor
did
it
consist
as
roger
had
intimated
of
shredded
whisk
brooms
but
was
a
delightful
meal
at
which
patty
became
better
acquainted
with
the
warner
family
and
confirmed
the
pleasant
impressions
she
had
received
the
night
before
after
breakfast
warner
announced
that
everybody
was
to
do
exactly
as
he
or
she
pleased
until
the
luncheon
hour
but
she
had
plans
herself
for
their
entertainment
in
the
afternoon
so
winthrop
and
roger
went
off
on
some
affairs
of
their
own
and
bertha
devoted
herself
to
the
amusement
of
the
two
girls
first
she
suggested
they
should
all
walk
around
the
place
and
this
proved
a
delightful
occupation
pine
branches
was
an
immense
estate
covering
hundreds
of
acres
and
there
was
a
brook
a
grove
golf
grounds
tennis
court
and
everything
that
could
by
any
possibility
add
to
the
interest
or
pleasure
of
its
occupants
but
my
chief
and
dearest
possession
said
bertha
smiling
is
abiram
a
dog
asked
patty
no
said
bertha
but
come
and
i
will
show
him
to
you
he
lives
down
here
in
this
little
house
the
little
house
was
very
like
a
but
when
they
reached
it
its
occupant
proved
to
be
a
woolly
black
bear
cub
he
a
perfect
dear
abiram
is
said
bertha
as
she
opened
the
door
and
the
fat
little
bear
came
waddling
out
he
was
fastened
to
a
long
chain
and
his
antics
were
funny
beyond
description
he
a
real
said
bertha
see
his
poses
are
just
like
those
of
the
bears
in
the
funny
papers
and
so
they
were
patty
and
elise
laughed
heartily
to
see
abiram
sit
up
and
cross
his
paws
over
his
fat
little
body
how
old
is
he
asked
patty
oh
very
young
he
just
a
cub
and
of
course
we
ca
keep
him
long
nobody
wants
a
big
bear
around
at
the
end
of
the
summer
papa
says
he
have
to
be
sent
to
the
zoo
but
we
have
lots
of
fun
looking
at
him
now
and
i
take
pictures
of
him
with
my
camera
he
a
dear
old
thing
bertha
was
sitting
down
by
the
bear
playing
with
him
as
with
a
puppy
and
indeed
the
soft
little
creature
showed
no
trace
of
wild
animal
habits
or
even
of
mischievous
intent
he
just
like
a
big
baby
said
patty
would
it
be
fun
to
dress
him
up
as
one
let
do
it
cried
bertha
gleefully
come
on
girls
let
fly
up
to
the
house
and
get
the
things
leaving
abiram
sitting
in
the
sun
the
three
girls
scampered
back
to
the
house
bertha
procured
two
large
white
aprons
and
declared
they
would
make
a
lovely
baby
dress
and
so
they
did
by
sewing
the
sides
together
nearly
to
the
top
and
tying
the
strings
in
great
bows
to
answer
as
shoulder
straps
the
dress
was
declared
perfect
a
dainty
sunbonnet
with
a
wide
fluffy
ruffle
which
was
a
part
of
bertha
own
wardrobe
was
taken
also
and
with
a
string
of
large
blue
beads
and
an
enormous
baby
rattle
which
bertha
unearthed
from
her
the
costume
was
complete
bertha
got
her
camera
and
giving
elise
a
small
light
chair
to
carry
they
all
ran
back
to
abiram
kennel
they
found
the
little
bear
peacefully
sleeping
in
the
sun
and
when
bertha
shook
him
awake
he
showed
no
resentment
and
graciously
allowed
himself
to
be
put
into
the
clothes
they
had
brought
his
forepaws
were
thrust
through
the
openings
left
for
the
purpose
and
the
stiff
white
bows
sticking
up
from
his
black
shoulders
made
the
girls
scream
with
laughter
the
ruffled
sunbonnet
was
put
on
his
head
and
coquettishly
tied
on
one
side
and
the
string
of
blue
beads
was
clasped
around
his
fat
neck
although
abiram
seemed
willing
to
submit
to
the
greatness
that
was
being
thrust
upon
him
he
experienced
some
difficulty
in
sitting
up
in
the
chair
in
the
position
which
bertha
insisted
upon
however
by
dint
of
patty
holding
his
head
up
from
behind
she
herself
being
screened
from
view
by
a
tree
trunk
they
induced
abiram
to
hold
the
rattle
long
enough
for
bertha
to
get
a
picture
illustration
although
a
successful
snapshot
was
only
achieved
after
many
attempts
although
a
successful
snapshot
was
only
achieved
after
many
attempts
yet
the
girls
had
great
fun
and
so
silly
and
ridiculous
did
the
little
bear
behave
that
patty
afterward
declared
she
had
never
laughed
so
much
in
all
her
life
after
luncheon
warner
took
her
guests
for
a
drive
declaring
that
after
their
automobile
tour
she
felt
sure
that
a
carriage
drive
would
be
a
pleasant
change
after
the
drive
there
was
afternoon
tea
in
the
library
when
the
men
appeared
and
everybody
chatted
gaily
over
the
events
of
the
day
then
they
all
dispersed
to
dress
for
dinner
and
patty
suddenly
realised
that
she
was
living
in
a
very
atmosphere
greatly
in
contrast
to
her
schoolgirl
life
bertha
was
a
year
or
two
older
than
patty
and
though
as
merry
and
full
of
fun
as
a
child
she
seemed
to
have
the
ways
and
effects
of
a
young
lady
elise
also
had
lived
a
life
which
had
accustomed
her
to
formality
and
ceremony
and
though
only
a
year
older
than
patty
in
reality
she
was
far
more
advanced
in
worldly
wisdom
and
ceremonious
observances
but
patty
was
adaptable
by
nature
and
when
in
rome
she
was
quite
ready
to
do
as
the
romans
did
so
she
put
on
one
of
her
prettiest
frocks
for
dinner
and
allowed
bertha
to
do
her
hair
in
a
new
way
which
seemed
to
add
a
year
or
so
to
her
appearance
there
were
a
few
other
guests
at
dinner
and
as
patty
always
enjoyed
meeting
strangers
she
took
great
interest
in
all
the
details
of
entertainment
at
pine
branches
at
the
table
she
found
herself
seated
between
bertha
and
winthrop
this
pleased
her
for
she
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
get
better
acquainted
with
the
young
man
of
whom
she
had
seen
little
during
the
day
although
frank
and
boyish
in
some
ways
winthrop
warner
gave
her
the
impression
of
being
very
wise
and
scholarly
she
said
as
much
to
him
whereupon
he
explained
that
he
was
a
student
and
was
making
a
specialty
of
certain
branches
of
scientific
lore
these
included
ethnology
and
anthropology
which
names
caused
patty
to
feel
a
sudden
awe
of
the
young
man
beside
her
but
winthrop
only
laughed
and
said
do
let
those
long
words
frighten
you
i
assure
you
that
they
stand
for
most
interesting
subjects
and
some
day
if
you
will
come
to
my
study
i
will
promise
to
prove
that
to
you
meantime
we
will
ignore
my
scientific
side
and
just
consider
that
we
are
two
gay
young
people
enjoying
a
summer
holiday
the
young
man
affable
manner
and
kind
smile
put
patty
quite
at
her
ease
and
she
chatted
so
merrily
that
when
the
dinner
hour
was
over
she
and
winthrop
had
become
good
friends
and
comrades
chapter
xv
miss
aurora
bender
after
a
visit
of
a
few
days
it
was
decided
that
and
farrington
and
roger
should
continue
the
on
to
boston
and
to
certain
places
along
the
new
england
coast
while
patty
and
elise
should
stay
at
pine
branches
for
a
longer
visit
the
girls
had
expected
to
continue
the
trip
with
the
others
but
bertha
had
coaxed
them
to
stay
longer
with
her
and
had
held
out
such
attractive
inducements
that
they
decided
to
remain
patty
herself
was
pleased
with
the
plan
because
she
still
felt
the
effects
of
her
recent
mental
strain
and
realised
that
the
luxurious
ease
of
pine
branches
would
be
far
more
of
a
rest
than
the
more
exciting
experiences
of
a
motor
trip
so
the
girls
were
installed
for
a
fortnight
or
more
in
the
beautiful
home
of
the
warners
and
with
so
many
means
of
pleasure
at
her
disposal
patty
looked
forward
to
a
delightful
period
of
both
rest
and
recreation
one
morning
bertha
declared
her
intention
of
taking
the
girls
to
call
on
miss
aurora
bender
who
is
she
inquired
patty
as
the
three
started
off
in
she
a
character
said
bertha
but
i
wo
tell
you
anything
about
her
you
can
see
her
and
judge
for
yourself
a
drive
of
several
miles
brought
them
to
a
quaint
farmhouse
the
house
which
had
the
appearance
of
being
very
old
was
built
of
stone
and
painted
a
light
yellow
with
white
trimmings
everything
about
the
place
was
in
perfect
repair
and
exquisite
order
and
as
they
drove
in
around
the
gravel
circle
that
surrounded
a
carefully
kept
bit
of
green
lawn
bertha
stopped
the
cart
at
an
and
the
girls
got
out
running
up
the
steps
bertha
clanged
the
old
brass
knocker
at
what
seemed
to
patty
to
be
the
kitchen
door
it
was
opened
by
a
tall
gaunt
woman
with
sharp
features
and
angular
figure
well
i
declare
to
goodness
bertha
warner
if
you
are
here
again
who
that
you
got
with
you
this
time
city
folks
i
well
come
in
all
of
you
but
wipe
your
feet
first
as
you
been
riding
i
they
ai
muddy
much
but
it
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
so
wipe
good
and
then
troop
in
miss
aurora
bender
had
pushed
her
heavy
glasses
up
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
her
smile
of
welcome
belied
the
gruffness
of
her
tone
and
the
seeming
inhospitality
of
her
words
the
girls
took
pains
to
wipe
their
dainty
boots
on
the
braided
rug
which
lay
just
outside
the
door
then
they
entered
a
spacious
room
which
seemed
to
partake
of
the
qualities
of
both
kitchen
and
at
one
end
was
an
immense
fireplace
with
an
swinging
crane
from
which
depended
many
skillets
and
kettles
of
highly
polished
brass
or
copper
on
either
side
of
the
room
was
a
large
dresser
with
glass
doors
through
which
showed
quantities
of
rare
old
china
that
made
patty
eyes
shine
with
delight
a
quaint
old
settle
and
various
old
chairs
of
windsor
pattern
stood
round
the
walls
the
floor
was
painted
yellow
and
here
and
there
were
braided
mats
of
various
designs
sit
down
girls
sit
down
said
miss
bender
cordially
and
now
bertha
tell
me
these
young
ladies
names
unless
that
is
to
say
rather
sit
in
the
parlour
we
would
rather
sit
in
the
parlour
miss
bender
said
bertha
quickly
and
as
if
fearing
her
hostess
might
not
follow
up
her
suggestion
bertha
opened
a
door
leading
to
the
front
hall
and
started
toward
the
parlour
herself
well
said
miss
bender
with
a
note
of
regret
in
her
voice
i
if
you
must
you
must
though
for
my
part
i
free
to
confess
that
this
room
a
heap
more
cozy
and
livable
that
may
be
said
bertha
who
had
beckoned
to
the
girls
to
follow
quickly
but
my
friends
are
from
the
city
as
you
suspected
and
they
do
often
have
a
chance
in
new
york
to
see
a
parlour
like
yours
miss
bender
as
bertha
had
intended
this
bit
of
flattery
mollified
the
old
lady
and
she
followed
her
guests
along
the
dark
hall
well
if
you
bound
to
have
it
so
she
said
do
wait
a
minute
and
let
me
get
in
there
and
pull
up
the
blinds
it
darker
than
coat
pocket
i
have
had
this
room
opened
since
mis
perkins
across
the
road
had
her
last
tea
fight
and
i
only
did
it
then
i
wanted
to
set
some
vases
of
my
early
primroses
in
the
windows
so
the
guests
might
see
as
they
came
by
seems
to
me
it
a
little
musty
in
here
but
land
a
room
will
get
musty
if
it
shut
up
and
what
earthly
good
is
a
parlour
except
to
keep
shut
up
as
miss
bender
talked
she
had
bustled
about
and
thrown
open
the
six
windows
of
the
large
room
into
which
bertha
had
taken
the
girls
the
sunlight
streamed
in
and
disclosed
a
scene
which
seemed
to
patty
like
a
wonderful
vision
of
a
century
ago
and
indeed
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
the
furniture
of
the
great
parlour
had
stood
precisely
as
they
now
saw
it
the
furniture
was
entirely
of
antique
mahogany
and
included
sofas
and
chairs
various
kinds
of
tables
bookcases
a
highboy
a
lowboy
and
other
pieces
of
furniture
of
which
patty
knew
neither
the
name
nor
the
use
the
pictures
on
the
wall
the
ornaments
the
books
and
the
brass
candlesticks
were
all
of
the
same
ancient
period
and
patty
felt
as
if
she
had
been
transported
back
into
the
life
of
her
as
she
had
herself
a
pretty
good
knowledge
of
the
styles
and
varieties
of
antique
furniture
she
won
miss
bender
heart
at
once
by
her
appreciation
of
her
heppelwhite
chairs
and
her
chippendale
you
do
say
said
miss
bender
looking
at
patty
in
admiration
that
you
really
know
one
style
from
another
lots
of
people
pretend
they
do
but
they
soon
get
confused
when
i
try
to
pin
down
patty
smiled
as
she
disclaimed
any
great
knowledge
of
the
subject
but
she
soon
found
that
she
knew
enough
to
satisfy
her
hostess
who
after
all
enjoyed
describing
her
treasures
even
more
than
listening
to
their
praises
miss
aurora
bender
was
a
lady
of
sudden
and
rapid
physical
motion
while
the
girls
were
examining
the
wonderful
old
relics
she
darted
from
the
room
and
returned
in
a
moment
carrying
two
large
baskets
they
were
of
the
type
of
reed
with
a
handle
over
the
top
and
a
cover
to
lift
up
on
either
side
miss
bender
plumped
herself
down
in
the
middle
of
a
long
sofa
and
began
rapidly
to
extract
the
contents
of
the
baskets
which
proved
to
be
numerous
fat
rolls
of
cotton
material
it
patchwork
she
announced
and
i
make
it
my
habit
to
get
all
the
help
i
can
i
piecing
a
quilt
pattern
and
while
i
know
as
it
the
prettiest
there
is
yet
i
do
know
as
is
if
you
girls
expect
to
sit
the
morning
and
i
must
say
you
look
like
it
you
might
lend
a
helping
hand
i
made
the
geese
i
otherwise
would
i
had
so
many
little
pieces
left
from
my
quilt
looks
just
as
well
of
course
but
takes
a
powerful
sight
of
time
to
sew
and
i
must
say
i
sorter
particular
about
sewing
however
i
do
you
young
things
of
this
day
and
generation
know
much
about
sewing
but
if
you
go
slow
you
ca
help
doing
it
pretty
well
as
she
talked
miss
bender
had
hastily
presented
each
of
the
girls
with
a
basted
block
of
patchwork
and
had
passed
around
a
and
a
small
box
containing
a
number
of
silver
thimbles
lucky
i
had
a
big
family
she
commented
else
i
do
know
what
done
for
thimbles
to
go
around
i
ca
abide
brass
things
that
make
your
finger
look
like
it
had
been
dipped
in
ink
but
thanks
to
my
seven
sisters
who
are
all
restin
comfortably
in
their
graves
i
have
enough
thimbles
to
provide
quite
a
parcel
of
company
here
your
thread
now
sew
away
while
we
talk
and
we
have
a
real
nice
little
bee
although
not
especially
fond
of
sewing
the
girls
looked
upon
this
episode
as
a
good
joke
and
fell
to
work
at
their
bits
of
cloth
elise
was
a
dainty
little
needlewoman
and
overhanded
rapidly
and
neatly
patty
did
fairly
well
though
her
stitches
were
not
quite
even
but
poor
bertha
found
her
work
a
difficult
task
she
never
did
fancywork
and
knew
nothing
of
sewing
so
her
thread
knotted
and
broke
and
her
patch
presented
a
sorry
sight
land
o
goshen
exclaimed
miss
aurora
is
that
the
best
you
can
do
bertha
warner
the
town
ought
to
take
up
a
subscription
to
put
you
in
a
sewin
school
here
child
let
me
show
you
miss
bender
took
bertha
block
and
tried
to
straighten
it
out
while
bertha
herself
made
funny
faces
at
the
other
girls
over
miss
shoulder
i
can
see
you
said
that
lady
calmly
i
guess
you
forget
that
big
mirror
opposite
but
them
faces
you
makin
ai
half
so
bad
as
this
sewin
of
yours
the
girls
all
laughed
outright
at
miss
bender
calm
acceptance
of
bertha
sauciness
and
bertha
herself
was
in
nowise
embarrassed
by
the
implied
rebuke
there
child
said
miss
aurora
smoothing
out
the
seams
with
her
thumb
nail
now
try
again
and
see
if
you
ca
do
it
some
better
is
your
quilt
nearly
done
miss
bender
asked
patty
yes
it
is
i
got
three
hundred
and
geese
finished
and
four
hundred
enough
i
work
on
it
myself
quite
a
spell
every
day

i
think

two
or
three
days

it
all
pieced
oh

bender
cried
bertha
then

aurora

bertha
looking
at
elise

block
and
patty

pretty
well
and
as
i
would
spoil
your
quilt
if
i
touched
it
miss
aurora

promise
to

alone
but
i
can

other
things

the
party

you
why
i
do
know
but
i
will
i
kinder
calculated
to
have
it
soon
anyhow
and
if
so
be
you
young
people
would
like
to
come
to
it
i
see
anything
to
hinder
we
say
a
week
from
the
date
was
decided
on
and
the
girls
went
home
in
high
glee
over
the
quilting
party
for
bertha
told
them
it
would
be
great
fun
of
a
sort
they
had
probably
never
seen
before
the
days
flew
by
rapidly
at
pine
branches
patty
rapidly
recovered
her
usual
perfect
health
and
rosy
cheeks
she
played
golf
and
tennis
she
went
for
long
rides
in
the
warners
or
carriages
and
also
on
horseback
there
were
many
guests
at
the
house
coming
and
going
and
among
these
one
day
came
phelps
whom
they
had
met
on
their
journey
out
from
new
york
this
gentleman
proved
to
be
of
a
merry
disposition
and
added
greatly
to
the
gaiety
of
the
party
while
he
was
there
roger
also
came
back
for
a
few
days
having
left
and
farrington
for
a
short
stay
at
nantucket
one
morning
as
patty
and
roger
stood
in
the
hall
waiting
for
the
other
young
people
to
join
them
they
were
startled
to
hear
angry
voices
in
the
this
room
was
separated
from
them
by
the
length
of
the
library
and
though
not
quite
distinct
the
voices
were
unmistakably
those
of
bertha
and
winthrop
you
did
said
winthrop
voice
do
deny
it
you
a
horrid
hateful
old
thing
i
did
any
such
thing
replied
bertha
voice
which
sounded
on
the
verge
of
tears
you
did
and
if
you
do
give
it
back
to
me
i
tell
mother
mother
said
if
she
caught
you
at
such
a
thing
again
she
punish
you
as
you
deserved
and
i
going
to
tell
her
patty
felt
most
uncomfortable
at
overhearing
this
quarrel
she
had
never
before
heard
a
word
of
disagreement
between
bertha
and
her
brother
and
she
was
surprised
as
well
as
sorry
to
hear
this
exhibition
of
temper
roger
looked
horrified
and
glanced
at
patty
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
do
the
voices
waxed
more
angry
and
they
heard
bertha
declare
you
a
horrid
old
telltale
go
on
and
tell
if
you
want
to
and
i
tell
what
you
stole
out
of
father
desk
last
week
how
did
you
know
that
and
winthrop
voice
rang
out
in
rage
oh
i
know
all
about
it
you
think
nobody
knows
anything
but
yourself
just
wait
till
i
tell
father
and
see
what
he
do
to
you
you
wo
tell
him
promise
me
you
wo
or
i
i
hit
you
there
take
that
that
seemed
to
be
a
resounding
blow
and
immediately
bertha
cries
broke
forth
in
angry
profusion
stop
crying
yelled
her
brother
and
stop
punching
me
stop
it
i
say
at
this
point
the
conversation
broke
off
suddenly
and
patty
and
roger
stared
in
stupefied
amazement
as
they
saw
bertha
and
winthrop
walk
in
smiling
and
hand
in
hand
from
exactly
the
opposite
direction
from
which
their
quarrelsome
voices
had
sounded
what
the
matter
said
bertha
why
do
you
look
so
shocked
and
scared
to
death
stammered
patty
while
roger
blurted
out
we
thought
we
heard
you
talking
over
that
way
and
then
you
came
in
from
this
way
who
could
it
have
been
the
voices
were
just
like
yours
bertha
and
winthrop
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
it
the
phonograph
said
bertha
winthrop
and
i
fixed
up
that
quarrel
record
just
for
fun
is
it
a
good
one
roger
understood
at
once
and
went
off
into
peals
of
laughter
but
patty
had
to
have
it
explained
to
her
you
see
said
winthrop
we
have
a
big
phonograph
and
we
make
records
for
it
ourselves
bertha
and
i
fixed
up
that
one
just
for
fun
and
elise
is
in
there
now
looking
after
it
come
on
in
and
see
it
they
all
went
into
the
and
winthrop
entertained
them
by
putting
in
various
cylinders
which
they
had
made
themselves
almost
as
funny
as
the
quarrel
was
bertha
account
of
the
occasion
when
she
fell
into
the
creek
and
many
funny
recitations
by
warner
also
made
amusing
records
patty
could
hardly
believe
that
she
had
not
heard
her
friends
voices
really
raised
in
anger
until
winthrop
put
the
same
record
in
and
let
her
hear
it
again
he
also
promised
her
that
some
day
she
should
make
a
record
for
herself
and
leave
it
at
pine
branches
as
a
memento
of
her
visit
chapter
xvi
a
quilting
party
miss
aurora
bender
quilting
party
was
to
begin
at
three
in
the
afternoon
and
the
girls
started
early
in
order
to
see
all
the
fun
they
were
to
stay
to
supper
and
the
young
men
were
to
come
over
and
escort
them
home
in
the
evening
when
they
reached
miss
bender
they
found
that
many
and
wonderful
preparations
had
been
made
miss
aurora
had
two
house
servants
emmeline
and
nancy
but
on
this
occasion
she
had
called
in
two
more
to
help
and
indeed
there
was
plenty
to
be
done
for
a
quilting
bee
was
to
miss
bender
mind
a
function
of
great
importance
the
last
of
a
large
family
miss
bender
was
a
woman
of
great
wealth
but
of
plain
and
tastes
though
amply
able
to
gratify
any
extravagant
wish
she
preferred
to
live
as
her
parents
had
lived
before
her
and
she
had
in
no
sense
kept
pace
with
the
progress
of
the
age
when
the
three
girls
reached
the
old
country
house
they
were
met
at
the
front
door
by
the
elderly
nancy
she
courtesied
with
grace
and
invited
them
to
step
into
the
bedroom
and
lay
off
their
things
this
bedroom
which
was
on
the
ground
floor
was
a
large
apartment
containing
a
marvellously
carved
bedstead
hung
with
chintz
curtains
and
draperies
the
room
also
contained
two
massive
bureaus
a
and
various
chairs
of
carved
mahogany
and
in
the
open
fireplace
was
an
enormous
bunch
of
feathery
asparagus
flecked
with
red
berries
oh
cried
patty
in
delight
if
nan
could
see
this
room
she
go
perfectly
crazy
is
this
house
great
why
it
quite
as
full
of
beautiful
old
things
as
washington
house
at
mt
vernon
i
have
seen
that
said
bertha
but
it
does
seem
as
if
anything
could
be
more
complete
or
perfect
in
its
way
than
this
house
is
come
on
girls
are
you
ready
the
girls
went
to
the
parlour
and
there
found
the
quilt
all
prepared
for
working
on
patty
had
never
before
seen
a
quilt
stretched
on
a
and
was
extremely
interested
it
was
a
very
large
quilt
and
its
innumerable
small
triangles
which
made
up
the
pattern
were
found
to
present
a
methodical
harmony
of
colouring
which
had
not
been
observable
before
the
strips
were
put
together
the
large
pieced
portion
was
uppermost
and
beneath
it
was
the
lining
with
layers
of
cotton
in
between
each
edge
was
pinned
at
intervals
to
a
long
strip
of
material
which
was
wound
round
and
round
the
frame
the
four
corners
of
the
frame
were
held
up
by
being
tied
to
the
backs
of
four
chairs
and
on
each
of
the
four
sides
of
the
quilt
were
three
more
chairs
for
the
expected
guests
to
occupy
almost
on
the
stroke
of
three
the
visitors
arrived
and
though
some
of
them
were
of
a
more
modern
type
than
miss
bender
yet
three
or
four
were
quite
as
and
as
their
hostess
they
are
native
up
here
bertha
explained
to
patty
there
are
only
a
few
of
the
old
new
england
settlers
left
most
of
the
population
here
is
composed
of
city
people
who
have
large
country
places
you
wo
often
get
an
opportunity
to
see
a
gathering
like
this
patty
realised
the
truth
of
this
and
was
both
surprised
and
pleased
to
find
that
these
country
ladies
showed
no
trace
of
embarrassment
or
before
the
city
girls
it
seemed
not
to
occur
to
them
that
there
was
any
difference
in
their
effects
and
indeed
patty
was
greatly
amused
because
one
of
the
old
ladies
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
patty
was
a
country
girl
and
brought
up
according
to
customs
this
old
lady
whose
name
was
quimby
sat
next
to
patty
at
the
quilt
and
after
she
had
peered
through
her
glasses
at
the
somewhat
uneven
stitches
which
poor
patty
was
trying
her
best
to
do
as
well
as
possible
she
remarked
you
ai
got
much
knack
have
you
you
have
to
practise
quite
a
spell
longer
before
you
can
quilt
your
own
house
goods
how
old
be
you
seventeen
said
patty
feeling
that
her
work
did
not
look
very
well
considering
her
age
seventeen
exclaimed
quimby
laws
sake
i
was
married
when
i
was
sixteen
and
i
quilted
as
good
then
as
i
do
now
i
over
eighty
now
and
i
ruther
quilt
than
do
anything
you
do
look
to
be
seventeen
and
you
do
look
to
be
eighty
either
said
patty
smiling
glad
to
be
able
to
turn
the
subject
by
complimenting
the
old
lady
the
quilting
lasted
all
the
afternoon
patty
grew
very
tired
of
the
unaccustomed
work
and
was
glad
when
miss
bender
noticed
it
and
told
her
to
run
out
into
the
garden
with
bertha
bertha
was
not
allowed
to
touch
the
quilt
with
her
incompetent
fingers
but
elise
sewed
away
thoroughly
enjoying
it
all
and
with
no
desire
to
avail
herself
of
miss
permission
to
stop
and
rest
patty
and
bertha
wandered
through
the
garden
in
great
delight
the
paths
were
bordered
with
tiny
box
hedges
which
though
many
years
old
were
kept
clean
and
free
from
deadwood
or
blemish
of
any
sort
and
were
perfectly
trimmed
in
shape
the
garden
included
quaint
old
flowers
such
as
marigolds
sweet
williams
bleeding
hearts
bachelors
buttons
jacob
ladder
and
many
others
of
which
patty
did
not
even
know
the
names
tall
hollyhocks
both
single
and
double
grew
against
the
wall
and
a
hop
vine
hung
in
green
profusion
every
flower
bed
was
of
exact
shape
and
looked
as
if
not
a
leaf
or
a
stem
would
dare
to
grow
otherwise
than
straight
and
true
what
a
lovely
old
garden
said
patty
sniffing
at
a
sprig
of
lemon
verbena
which
she
had
picked
yes
it
wonderful
said
bertha
i
mean
to
ask
miss
bender

i
may
bring
my
camera
over
and

a
picture
of
it
and
if

patty
and

pictures

the
house

show
them
to
nan

me
about
nan
said
bertha
she
your
stepmother
is
she
yes
said
patty
but
she
only
six
years
older
than
i
am
so
that
the
stepmother
part
of
it
seems
ridiculous
we
more
like
sisters
and
she
perfectly
crazy
over
old
china
and
old
furniture
she
love
miss
bender
things
perhaps
she
come
up
while
you
here
said
bertha
i
ask
mother
to
write
for
her
thank
you
said
patty
but
i
afraid
she
wo
my
father
ca
leave
for
his
vacation
until
july
and
then
we
all
going
away
together
but
i
do
know
where
just
then
elise
came
flying
out
to
them
with
the
announcement
that
supper
was
ready
and
they
were
to
come
right
in
quick
the
table
was
spread
in
the
large
room
which
patty
had
thought
was
the
kitchen
it
probably
had
been
built
for
that
purpose
but
other
kitchens
had
been
added
beyond
it
and
for
the
last
half
century
it
had
been
used
as
a
the
table
was
drawn
out
to
its
full
length
which
made
it
very
long
indeed
and
it
was
filled
with
what
seemed
to
patty
viands
enough
to
feed
an
army
at
one
end
was
a
young
pig
roasted
whole
with
a
lemon
in
his
mouth
and
a
design
in
cloves
stuck
into
his
fat
little
side
at
the
other
end
was
a
baked
ham
whose
crisp
crust
could
only
be
attained
by
the
old
cook
who
had
been
in
the
bender
family
for
many
years
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
table
on
either
side
was
a
succession
of
various
cold
meats
alternating
with
pickles
jellies
and
savories
of
various
sorts
after
the
guests
were
seated
nancy
brought
in
platters
of
biscuits
from
the
kitchen
and
miss
aurora
herself
made
the
tea
the
furnishings
of
the
table
were
of
old
blue
and
white
china
of
great
age
and
priceless
value
the
old
family
silver
too
was
a
marvel
in
itself
and
the
tea
service
which
miss
bender
manipulated
with
some
pride
was
over
a
hundred
years
old
patty
was
greatly
impressed
at
this
unusual
scene
but
when
the
plates
were
removed
after
the
first
course
and
the
busy
prepared
to
serve
the
dessert
she
was
highly
entertained
for
the
next
course
though
consisting
only
of
preserves
and
cake
was
served
in
an
unusual
manner
the
preserves
included
every
variety
known
to
housewives
and
a
few
more
in
addition
to
this
miss
aurora
announced
in
a
voice
which
was
calm
with
repressed
satisfaction
that
she
had
fourteen
kinds
of
cake
to
put
at
the
disposal
of
her
guests
none
of
these
sorts
could
be
mixed
with
any
other
sort
and
the
result
was
fourteen
separate
baskets
and
platters
of
cake
the
table
became
crowded
before
they
had
all
been
brought
in
from
the
kitchen
and
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
the
serving
maids
placed
the
later
supplies
on
chairs
which
they
stood
behind
the
guests
and
the
ladies
amiably
turned
round
in
their
seats
inspected
the
cake
partook
of
it
if
they
desired
and
gracefully
pushed
the
chair
along
to
the
next
neighbour
this
seemed
to
the
city
girls
a
most
amusing
performance
but
patty
immediately
adapted
herself
to
what
was
apparently
the
custom
of
the
house
and
gravely
looked
at
the
cake
each
time
selected
such
as
pleased
her
fancy
and
pushed
the
chair
along
noticing
patty
gravity
as
she
accomplished
this
performance
elise
very
nearly
lost
her
own
but
patty
nudged
her
under
the
table
and
she
managed
to
behave
with
propriety
the
conversation
at
the
table
was
without
a
trace
of
hilarity
and
included
only
the
most
dignified
subjects
the
ladies
ate
mincingly
with
their
little
fingers
sticking
out
straight
or
curved
in
what
they
considered
a
most
elegant
fashion
miss
aurora
was
in
her
element
she
was
truly
proud
of
her
home
and
its
appointments
and
she
dearly
loved
to
entertain
company
at
tea
to
her
mind
and
indeed
to
the
minds
of
most
of
those
present
the
success
of
a
tea
depended
entirely
upon
the
number
of
kinds
of
cake
that
were
served
and
miss
bender
felt
that
with
fourteen
she
had
broken
any
hitherto
known
record
it
was
an
unwritten
law
that
each
kind
of
cake
must
be
really
a
separate
recipe
to
take
a
portion
of
ordinary
batter
and
stir
in
some
chopped
nuts
and
another
portion
and
mix
in
some
raisins
by
no
means
met
the
requirements
of
the
case
this
patty
learned
from
remarks
made
by
the
visitors
and
also
from
miss
aurora
own
delicately
veiled
intimations
that
each
of
her
fourteen
kinds
was
a
totally
different
and
distinct
recipe
patty
could
help
wondering
what
would
become
of
all
this
cake
for
after
all
the
guests
could
eat
but
a
small
portion
of
it
and
it
occurred
to
her
also
that
the
ways
of
the
people
in
previous
generations
as
exemplified
in
miss
bender
customs
seemed
to
show
quite
as
great
a
lack
of
a
sense
of
proportion
as
many
of
our
modern
absurdities
after
supper
the
guests
immediately
departed
for
their
homes
carriages
arrived
for
the
different
ones
and
they
went
away
after
volubly
expressing
to
their
hostess
their
thanks
for
her
delightful
entertainment
the
girls
expected
winthrop
and
roger
to
come
for
them
in
the
but
they
had
not
told
them
to
come
quite
so
early
as
now
seemed
necessary
in
some
embarrassment
they
told
miss
bender
that
they
would
have
to
trespass
on
her
hospitality
for
perhaps
an
hour
longer
my
land
o
goodness
she
exclaimed
looking
at
them
in
dismay
why
i
got
to
set
this
house
to
rights
and
i
ca
wait
an
hour
to
begin
do
mind
us
miss
bender
said
bertha
just
shut
us
up
in
some
room
by
ourselves
and
we
stay
there
and
not
bother
you
a
bit
unless
perhaps
we
can
help
you
help
me
no
indeed
there
ca
anybody
help
me
when
i
clearin
up
after
a
quiltin
unless
it
somebody
that
knows
my
ways
but
i
like
to
amuse
you
children
somehow
i
tell
you
what
you
can
go
up
in
the
front
bedroom
if
you
like
and
there
a
chest
of
clothes
there
ca
you
play
at
dressin
up
yes
indeed
cried
bertha
just
the
thing
give
us
some
candles
provided
with
two
candles
apiece
the
girls
followed
miss
aurora
to
a
large
bedroom
on
the
second
floor
which
also
boasted
its
carved
and
chintz
draperies
there
said
miss
aurora
throwing
open
a
great
chest
you
ought
to
get
some
fun
out
of
trying
on
those
and
peacocking
around
but
do
come
downstairs
to
show
off
to
me
for
you
only
bother
me
out
of
my
wits
i
let
you
know
when
your
folks
come
for
you
miss
bender
trotted
away
and
the
girls
quite
ready
for
a
lark
tossed
over
the
quaint
old
gowns
beautiful
costumes
were
there
of
the
period
of
about
a
hundred
years
ago
lustrous
silks
and
dainty
dimities
embroidered
muslins
and
heavy
velvets
patty
had
never
seen
such
a
sight
after
looking
them
over
the
girls
picked
out
the
ones
they
preferred
and
taking
off
their
own
frocks
proceeded
to
try
them
on
bertha
had
chosen
a
blue
and
white
silk
of
a
bayadere
stripe
with
lace
ruffles
at
the
neck
and
wrists
and
a
skirt
of
voluminous
fulness
elise
wore
a
white
empire
gown
that
made
her
look
exactly
like
the
empress
josephine
while
patty
arrayed
herself
in
a
flowered
silk
of
dresden
effect
with
a
pointed
bodice
square
neck
and
elbow
sleeves
with
lace
frills
in
great
glee
the
girls
pranced
around
regretting
there
was
no
one
to
whom
they
might
exhibit
their
masquerade
costumes
but
miss
bender
had
been
so
positive
in
her
orders
that
they
dared
not
go
downstairs
suddenly
they
heard
the
toot
of
an
automobile
illustration
patty
arrayed
herself
in
a
flowered
silk
of
dresden
effect
that
our
car
cried
bertha
i
know
the
horn
let
go
down
just
as
we
are
for
the
benefit
of
winthrop
and
roger
in
answer
to
miss
bender
call
from
below
the
girls
trooped
downstairs
and
merrily
presented
themselves
for
inspection
phelps
had
come
with
the
others
and
if
the
young
men
were
pleased
at
the
picture
the
three
girls
presented
miss
aurora
herself
was
no
less
so
my
she
said
you
do
look
fine
i
declare
now
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
make
each
of
you
young
ladies
a
present
of
the
gown
you
have
on
if
you
care
to
keep
it
i
never
miss
them
for
i
have
trunks
and
chests
full
besides
those
you
saw
and
i
right
down
glad
to
give
them
to
you
you
can
wear
them
sometimes
at
your
fancy
dress
parties
the
girls
were
overjoyed
at
miss
bender
gift
and
bertha
declared
they
would
wear
them
home
and
she
would
send
over
for
their
other
dresses
the
next
day
so
donning
their
wraps
the
merry
modern
maids
in
their
antique
garb
made
their
adieus
to
miss
aurora
and
were
soon
in
the
big
speeding
for
home
chapter
xvii
a
summer
christmas
although
they
had
intended
to
stay
but
a
fortnight
patty
and
elise
remained
with
the
warners
all
through
the
month
of
june
and
even
then
bertha
begged
them
to
stay
longer
but
the
day
for
their
departure
was
set
in
the
first
week
of
july
and
bertha
declared
that
they
must
have
a
big
party
of
some
kind
as
their
last
entertainment
for
the
girls
so
warner
invited
a
number
of
young
people
for
a
house
party
during
the
last
few
days
of
patty
stay
i
wish
said
bertha
a
few
days
before
the
fourth
that
we
could
have
some
kind
of
a
party
on
the
fourth
of
july
that
would
be
different
from
just
an
ordinary
party
have
an
automobile
party
suggested
roger
who
was
present
i
do
mean
that
kind
said
bertha
i
mean
a
party
in
the
house
but
something
that
would
be
fun
there
is
anything
to
do
on
fourth
of
july
except
have
fireworks
and
that
is
much
fun
i
tell
you
what
said
phelps
who
was
at
pine
branches
on
one
of
his
flying
visits
have
a
christmas
party
a
christmas
party
on
fourth
of
july
exclaimed
bertha
that
just
the
thing
phelps
you
a
real
genius
that
just
what
we
do
and
we
have
a
christmas
tree
and
give
each
other
gifts
and
everything
great
said
roger
and
we
have
a
yule
log
blazing
and
we
all
wear
our
fur
coats
no
not
that
said
bertha
laughing
we
melt
but
we
have
all
the
christmas
effects
that
we
can
think
of
and
each
one
must
help
the
crowd
of
merry
young
people
who
were
gathered
at
pine
branches
eagerly
fell
in
with
bertha
plan
and
each
began
to
make
preparations
for
the
festival
the
girls
made
gifts
which
they
carefully
kept
secret
from
the
ones
for
whom
they
were
intended
and
many
trips
were
made
to
the
village
for
materials
the
boys
also
had
many
mysterious
errands
and
and
warner
who
entered
heartily
into
the
spirit
of
the
fun
were
frequently
consulted
under
strict
bonds
of
confidence
fourth
of
july
came
and
proved
to
be
a
warm
though
not
a
sultry
summer
day
invitations
had
been
sent
out
and
a
large
party
of
young
people
were
expected
in
the
evening
and
during
the
day
those
who
were
staying
at
pine
branches
found
plenty
to
do
by
way
of
preparation
a
large
christmas
tree
had
been
cut
down
and
was
brought
into
the
library
as
soon
as
it
was
set
up
the
work
of
decoration
began
and
it
was
hung
with
strings
of
popcorn
and
tinsel
filigree
which
warner
had
saved
from
previous
christmas
trees
dozens
of
candles
too
were
put
on
the
branches
to
be
lighted
at
night
the
boys
brought
in
great
boughs
of
evergreen
and
cut
them
up
while
the
girls
made
ropes
and
wreaths
and
stars
with
which
to
adorn
the
room
phelps
had
sent
to
new
york
for
a
large
boxful
of
artificial
holly
and
this
added
greatly
to
the
christmas
effect
patty
was
in
her
element
helping
with
these
arrangements
for
she
dearly
loved
to
make
believe
and
the
idea
of
a
christmas
party
in
midsummer
appealed
very
strongly
to
her
sense
of
humour
her
energy
and
enthusiasm
were
untiring
and
her
original
ideas
called
forth
the
hearty
applause
of
the
others
she
was
consulted
about
everything
and
her
decisions
were
always
accepted
phelps
too
proved
a
clever
and
willing
worker
he
was
an
athletic
young
man
and
he
seemed
to
be
capable
of
doing
half
a
dozen
different
things
at
once
he
cut
greens
and
hung
wreaths
and
ran
up
and
down
stepladders
and
even
managed
to
fasten
a
large
gilt
star
to
the
very
top
branch
of
the
christmas
tree
after
the
decorations
were
all
completed
everybody
brought
their
gifts
neatly
tied
up
and
labelled
and
either
hung
them
on
the
tree
or
piled
them
up
around
the
platform
on
which
it
stood
well
you
children
have
done
wonders
said
warner
looking
in
at
the
library
door
you
have
transformed
this
room
until
i
hardly
can
recognise
it
and
it
looks
for
all
the
world
exactly
like
christmas
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
it
is
really
fourth
of
july
it
seems
too
bad
not
to
have
any
of
the
fourth
of
july
spirit
mixed
in
with
it
said
winthrop
but
i
suppose
it
would
spoil
the
harmony
but
we
really
ought
to
use
a
little
gunpowder
in
honour
of
the
day
come
on
patty
your
work
is
about
finished
let
go
out
and
put
off
a
few
firecrackers
all
right
said
patty
just
wait
till
i
tack
up
this
motto
and
i
be
ready
i
do
that
said
roger
you
infants
run
along
and
show
off
your
patriotism
and
i
join
you
in
a
few
minutes
you
must
be
tired
said
winthrop
to
patty
as
they
sauntered
out
on
the
lawn
you
worked
awfully
hard
with
those
evergreen
things
let
go
out
on
the
lake
and
take
our
firecrackers
with
us
that
will
rest
you
and
it
will
be
fun
besides
the
lake
so
called
by
courtesy
was
really
an
artificial
pond
and
though
not
large
it
provided
a
great
deal
of
amusement
there
were
several
boats
and
selecting
a
small
cedar
one
winthrop
assisted
patty
in
sprang
in
himself
and
pushed
off
if
it
christmas
we
ought
to
be
going
skating
on
the
lake
instead
of
rowing
said
patty
it
is
christmas
now
said
winthrop
you
get
your
holidays
mixed
up
we
come
out
here
to
celebrate
independence
day
see
what
brought
from
his
pockets
the
young
man
produced
several
packs
of
firecrackers
what
fun
cried
patty
i
feel
as
if
i
were
a
child
again
let
me
set
some
off
have
you
any
punk
yes
said
winthrop
gravely
producing
some
short
sticks
of
punk
from
another
pocket
and
lighting
one
he
gave
it
to
patty
but
how
can
i
set
them
off
said
patty
i
afraid
to
have
them
in
the
boat
and
we
ca
throw
them
out
on
the
water
we
manage
this
way
said
winthrop
and
drawing
one
of
the
oars
into
the
boat
he
laid
a
lighted
firecracker
on
the
blade
and
pushed
it
out
again
the
firecracker
went
off
with
a
bang
and
in
great
glee
patty
pulled
in
the
other
oar
and
tried
the
same
plan
then
they
set
off
a
whole
pack
at
once
and
as
the
length
of
the
oar
was
not
quite
sufficient
for
safety
winthrop
let
it
slip
from
the
and
float
away
on
the
water
as
he
had
previously
tied
a
string
to
the
handle
so
that
he
could
pull
the
oar
back
at
will
this
was
a
great
game
and
the
floating
oar
with
its
freight
of
snapping
firecrackers
provided
much
amusement
the
noise
of
the
explosions
brought
the
others
running
to
the
scene
and
three
or
four
more
boats
were
soon
out
on
the
lake
firecrackers
went
snapping
in
every
direction
and
torpedoes
were
thrown
from
one
boat
to
another
until
the
ammunition
was
exhausted
then
the
merry
crowd
trooped
back
to
the
house
for
luncheon
i
never
had
such
a
lovely
fourth
of
july
said
patty
to
her
kind
hostess
everything
is
different
from
anything
i
ever
did
before
this
house
is
just
like
fairyland
you
never
know
what
is
going
to
happen
next
after
luncheon
the
party
broke
up
in
various
small
groups
some
of
the
more
energetic
ones
played
golf
or
tennis
but
patty
declared
it
was
too
warm
for
any
unnecessary
exertion
come
for
a
little
walk
with
me
said
roger
we
walk
down
in
the
grove
it
cool
and
shady
there
and
we
can
play
if
you
like
i
go
to
the
grove
said
patty
but
i
do
want
to
play
anything
this
is
a
day
just
to
be
idle
and
enjoy
living
without
doing
anything
else
they
strolled
down
toward
the
grove
and
were
joined
on
the
way
by
bertha
and
phelps
who
were
just
returning
from
a
call
on
abiram
i
think
abiram
ought
to
come
to
the
christmas
party
said
bertha
i
know
he
enjoy
seeing
the
tree
lighted
up
he
shall
come
said
dick
phelps
i
bring
him
myself
do
said
patty
and
we
tie
a
red
ribbon
round
his
neck
with
a
sprig
of
holly
and
i
see
to
it
that
there
a
present
on
the
tree
for
him
the
quartet
walked
on
to
the
grove
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
under
the
pine
trees
i
feel
very
patriotic
said
patty
who
was
decorated
with
several
small
flags
which
she
had
stuck
in
her
hair
and
in
her
belt
and
i
think
we
ought
to
sing
some
national
anthems
so
they
sang
the
banner
and
other
patriotic
airs
until
they
were
interrupted
by
winthrop
and
elise
who
came
toward
them
singing
a
christmas
carol
i
asked
you
to
come
here
said
roger
aside
to
patty
because
i
wanted
to
see
you
alone
for
a
minute
and
now
all
these
other
people
have
come
and
spoiled
my
plan
come
on
over
to
the
orchard
will
you
of
course
i
will
said
patty
jumping
up
what
is
the
secret
you
have
to
tell
me
some
plan
for
no
said
roger
hesitating
a
little
that
is
yes
not
exactly
they
had
walked
away
from
the
others
and
roger
took
from
his
pocket
a
tiny
box
which
he
offered
to
patty
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
little
christmas
present
he
said
as
a
sort
of
memento
of
this
jolly
day
and
i
thought
maybe
you
wear
it
how
lovely
cried
patty
as
she
opened
the
box
and
saw
a
little
pin
shaped
like
a
spray
of
holly
it
perfectly
sweet
thank
you
ever
so
much
roger
but
why
did
you
put
it
on
the
tree
for
me
oh
they
are
only
having
foolish
presents
on
the
tree
jokes
you
know
and
all
that
oh
is
this
a
real
present
then
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
accept
it
i
never
had
a
present
from
a
young
man
before
roger
looked
a
little
embarrassed
but
patty
gay
delight
was
entirely
free
from
any
trace
of
anyway
i
am
going
to
keep
it
she
said
because
it
so
pretty
and
i
like
to
think
that
you
gave
it
to
me
roger
looked
greatly
gratified
and
seemed
to
take
the
matter
with
more
seriousness
than
patty
did
she
pinned
the
pretty
little
trinket
on
her
collar
and
thought
no
more
about
it
dinner
was
early
that
night
for
there
was
much
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
final
preparations
before
the
guests
came
to
the
christmas
party
the
christmas
pretence
was
intended
as
a
surprise
to
those
not
staying
in
the
house
and
after
all
had
arrived
the
doors
of
the
library
were
thrown
open
with
shouts
of
merry
christmas
and
indeed
it
did
seem
like
a
sudden
transition
back
into
the
winter
the
christmas
tree
with
its
gay
decorations
and
lighted
candles
was
a
beautiful
sight
and
the
room
with
its
spicy
odours
of
spruce
and
pine
intensified
the
illusion
shouts
of
delight
went
up
on
all
sides
and
falling
quickly
into
the
spirit
of
it
all
the
guests
at
once
began
to
pretend
it
was
really
christmas
and
greeted
each
other
with
appropriate
good
wishes
mischievous
patty
had
slyly
tied
a
sprig
of
mistletoe
to
the
chandelier
and
dick
phelps
by
a
clever
manoeuvre
had
succeeded
in
getting
warner
to
stand
under
it
the
good
lady
was
quite
unaware
of
their
plans
and
when
phelps
kissed
her
soundly
on
her
plump
cheek
she
was
decidedly
surprised
but
the
explanation
amply
justified
his
audacity
and
warner
laughingly
declared
that
she
would
resign
her
place
to
some
of
the
younger
ladies
the
greatest
fun
came
when
winthrop
distributed
the
presents
from
the
tree
none
of
them
was
expensive
or
valuable
but
most
of
them
were
clever
merry
little
jokes
which
teased
the
recipients
true
to
his
word
phelps
brought
abiram
in
leading
him
by
his
long
chain
patty
had
tied
a
red
ribbon
round
his
neck
with
a
huge
bow
and
had
further
dressed
him
up
in
a
paper
cap
which
she
had
taken
from
a
german
cracker
motto
abiram
received
a
stick
of
candy
as
his
gift
and
was
as
much
pleased
apparently
as
the
rest
of
the
party
many
of
the
presents
were
accompanied
by
little
verses
or
lines
of
doggerel
and
the
reading
of
these
caused
much
merriment
and
laughter
after
the
presentations
supper
was
served
and
here
warner
had
provided
her
part
of
the
surprise
not
even
those
staying
in
the
house
knew
of
their
hostess
plans
and
when
they
all
trooped
out
to
the
a
real
christmas
feast
awaited
them
the
long
table
was
decorated
with
red
ribbons
and
holly
and
red
candles
with
red
paper
shades
christmas
bells
hung
above
the
table
and
at
each
plate
were
appropriate
souvenirs
in
the
centre
of
the
table
was
a
tiny
christmas
tree
with
lighted
candles
a
miniature
copy
of
the
one
they
had
just
left
even
the
viands
partook
of
the
christmas
character
and
from
roast
turkey
to
plum
pudding
no
detail
was
spared
to
make
it
a
true
christmas
feast
the
young
people
did
full
justice
to
warner
hospitality
and
warmly
appreciated
the
kind
thoughtfulness
which
had
made
the
supper
so
attractive
in
every
way
then
they
adjourned
to
the
parlour
for
informal
dancing
and
wound
up
the
party
with
an
virginia
reel
which
was
led
by
and
warner
warner
was
a
most
genial
host
and
his
merry
quips
and
repartee
kept
the
young
people
laughing
gaily
when
at
last
the
guests
departed
it
was
with
assurances
that
they
had
never
had
such
a
delightful
christmas
party
even
in
midwinter
and
had
never
had
such
a
delightful
fourth
of
july
party
even
in
midsummer
chapter
xviii
at
sandy
cove
when
the
day
came
for
patty
and
elise
to
leave
pine
branches
everyone
concerned
was
truly
sorry
elise
had
long
been
a
favourite
with
the
warners
and
they
had
grown
to
love
patty
quite
as
well
roger
was
still
there
and
and
farrington
came
for
the
young
people
in
their
they
were
returning
from
a
most
interesting
trip
which
had
extended
as
far
as
portland
after
hearing
some
accounts
of
it
patty
felt
sure
that
she
would
have
enjoyed
it
but
then
she
had
also
greatly
enjoyed
her
visit
at
pine
branches
and
she
felt
sure
that
it
had
been
better
for
her
physically
than
the
exertion
and
excitement
of
the
besides
this
the
farringtons
assured
her
that
there
would
be
many
other
opportunities
for
her
to
go
touring
with
them
and
they
would
always
be
glad
to
have
her
so
one
bright
morning
soon
after
the
fourth
of
july
the
fact
started
off
again
with
its
original
party
they
made
the
trip
to
new
york
entirely
without
accident
or
mishap
of
any
kind
which
greatly
pleased
roger
as
it
demonstrated
that
the
fact
was
not
always
a
stubborn
thing
patty
was
to
spend
the
months
of
july
and
august
with
her
father
and
nan
who
had
rented
a
house
on
long
island
the
house
was
near
the
summer
home
at
sandy
cove
for
nan
had
thought
it
would
be
pleasant
to
be
near
her
friends
who
were
also
patty
relatives
and
fairfield
had
already
gone
to
long
island
and
the
farringtons
were
to
take
patty
over
there
in
the
so
after
staying
a
day
or
two
with
elise
in
new
york
patty
again
took
her
place
in
the
car
for
the
journey
to
her
new
home
farrington
and
elise
went
with
her
and
after
seeing
her
safely
in
her
father
care
returned
to
the
city
that
same
day
patty
was
glad
to
see
her
father
and
nan
again
and
was
delighted
with
the
beautiful
house
which
they
had
taken
for
the
summer
how
large
it
is
she
exclaimed
as
she
looked
about
her
we
three
people
will
be
lost
in
it
we
going
to
have
a
lot
of
company
said
nan
i
invited
nearly
everyone
i
know
and
i
shall
expect
you
to
help
me
entertain
them
gladly
said
patty
there
are
no
horrid
lessons
in
the
way
now
and
you
may
command
my
full
time
and
attention
the
day
after
patty
return
to
her
family
she
proposed
that
they
go
over
to
see
the
barlows
it
an
awful
hot
afternoon
said
nan
but
i
suppose
we
ca
be
any
warmer
there
than
here
so
arraying
themselves
in
fresh
cool
white
dresses
nan
and
patty
started
to
make
their
call
the
barlows
summer
place
was
called
the
and
as
nan
and
patty
both
knew
the
name
described
the
house
extremely
well
as
bob
barlow
sometimes
said
the
motto
of
their
home
seemed
to
be
no
place
for
nothin
and
nothin
in
its
place
but
as
the
family
had
lived
up
to
this
principle
for
many
years
it
was
not
probable
things
would
ever
be
any
different
with
them
and
it
did
not
prevent
their
being
a
delightful
family
while
their
vagaries
often
proved
extremely
entertaining
but
when
nan
and
patty
neared
the
house
they
saw
no
sign
of
anybody
about
the
doors
and
windows
were
all
open
and
the
visitors
walked
in
looked
in
the
various
rooms
and
even
went
upstairs
but
found
nobody
anywhere
i
look
in
the
kitchen
said
patty
surely
old
hopalong
the
cook
will
be
there
they
ca
all
be
away
and
the
house
all
open
like
this
but
the
kitchen
too
was
deserted
and
nan
said
well
let
us
sit
on
the
front
verandah
a
while
it
must
be
that
somebody
will
come
home
soon
and
anyway
i
too
warm
and
tired
to
walk
right
back
in
the
broiling
sun
so
they
sat
on
the
verandah
for
half
an
hour
and
then
patty
said
give
one
more
look
inside
the
house
and
if
we
ca
find
anybody
go
home
all
right
said
nan
and
in
they
went
through
the
vacant
rooms
and
again
to
the
kitchen
why
there
hopalong
said
patty
as
she
saw
the
old
coloured
woman
busy
about
her
work
though
indeed
hopalong
slow
movements
could
not
be
accurately
described
by
the
word
busy
hello

patty

and

for

hopalong
threw
open
the
door
that
led
from
the
kitchen
to
the
cellar
stairs
and
holding
up
their
dainty
white
skirts
patty
and
nan
started
down
the
rather
dark
staircase
look
at
those
white
shoes
coming
downstairs
they
heard
bumble
voice
cry
i
do
believe
it
nan
and
patty
it
certainly
is
said
patty
and
as
she
reached
the
last
step
she
looked
around
in
astonishment
and
then
burst
into
laughter
well
you
do
beat
all
she
said
we
been
sitting
on
the
front
verandah
half
an
hour
wondering
where
you
could
be
is
it
nice
said
barlow
after
she
had
greeted
her
guests
it
is
indeed
said
patty
it
the
greatest
scheme
i
ever
heard
of
the
cellar
which
had
been
recently
had
been
converted
into
a
funny
sort
of
a
on
the
floor
was
spread
a
large
white
whose
original
use
had
been
for
a
dancing
crash
the
chairs
and
sofas
were
all
of
wicker
and
though
in
various
stages
of
dilapidation
were
cool
and
comfortable
a
table
in
the
center
was
covered
with
a
white
cloth
and
the
sofa
pillows
were
in
white
ruffled
cases
bumble
explained
that
the
intent
was
to
have
everything
white
but
they
had
been
able
to
carry
out
that
idea
fully
as
they
had
so
few
white
things
the
cat
is
all
right
said
patty
looking
at
a
large
white
cat
that
lay
curled
up
on
a
white
fur
rug
yes
is
she
a
beautiful
cat
her
name
is
the
countess
and
when
awake
she
exceedingly
aristocratic
and
dignified
looking
but
almost
never
awake
oh
here
comes
hopalong
with
our
lemonade
the
old
negro
lumbered
down
the
steps
and
bumble
took
the
tray
from
her
and
setting
it
on
the
table
served
the
guests
to
iced
lemonade
and
tiny
thin
cakes
of
hopalong
concoction
now
is
this
nice
said
barlow
as
they
sat
chatting
and
feasting
you
see
how
cool
and
comfortable
it
is
although
it
so
warm
out
of
doors
i
dare
say
i
shall
get
rheumatism
as
it
seems
a
little
damp
here
but
when
i
feel
it
coming
on
i
going
to
move
my
chair
over
onto
that
fur
rug
and
then
i
think
there
will
be
no
danger
it
is
delightfully
cool
said
patty
and
i
think
it
a
most
ingenious
idea
if
we
had
only
known
sooner
that
you
were
here
though
we
could
have
had
a
much
longer
visit
it
so
fortunate
said
bumble
whom
patty
could
remember
to
call
helen
that
you
chanced
to
be
dressed
in
white
you
fit
right
in
to
the
colour
scheme
mother
and
i
meant
to
wear
white
down
here
but
all
our
white
frocks
have
gone
to
the
laundry
but
if
you
come
over
again
after
a
day
or
two
we
have
this
place
all
fixed
up
fine
you
see
we
only
thought
of
it
this
morning
it
was
so
unbearably
hot
we
really
had
to
do
something
soon
uncle
ted
and
bob
came
in
and
after
a
while
fairfield
arrived
the
merry
party
still
stayed
in
the
cellar
room
and
one
and
all
pronounced
it
a
most
clever
idea
for
a
hot
day
the
barlows
were
delighted
that
the
fairfields
were
to
be
near
them
for
the
summer
and
many
good
times
were
planned
for
patty
was
very
fond
of
her
barlow
cousins
but
after
returning
to
her
own
home
which
nan
with
the
special
pride
of
a
young
housekeeper
kept
in
the
daintiest
possible
order
patty
declared
that
she
was
glad
her
father
had
chosen
a
wife
who
had
the
proper
ideas
of
managing
a
house
nan
and
patty
were
congenial
in
their
tastes
and
though
patty
had
had
some
experience
in
housekeeping
she
was
quite
willing
to
accept
any
innovations
that
nan
might
suggest
indeed
she
said
i
am
only
too
glad
not
to
have
any
of
the
care
and
responsibility
of
keeping
house
and
i
propose
to
enjoy
an
idle
summer
after
my
hard
year
in
school
so
the
days
passed
rapidly
and
happily
there
were
many
guests
at
the
house
and
as
the
fairfields
were
rather
well
acquainted
with
the
summer
people
at
sandy
cove
they
received
many
invitations
to
entertainments
of
various
kinds
the
farringtons
often
came
down
in
their
and
made
a
flying
visit
or
took
the
fairfields
for
a
ride
and
patty
hoped
that
the
warners
would
visit
them
before
the
summer
was
over
one
day
phelps
appeared
unexpectedly
and
from
nowhere
in
particular
he
came
in
his
big
and
that
day
patty
chanced
to
be
the
only
one
of
the
family
at
home
he
invited
her
to
go
for
a
short
ride
with
him
saying
they
could
easily
be
back
by
dinner
time
when
the
others
were
expected
home
glad
of
the
opportunity
patty
ran
for
her
automobile
coat
and
hood
and
soon
they
were
flying
along
the
country
roads
part
of
the
time
they
went
at
a
mad
rate
of
speed
and
part
of
the
time
they
went
slower
that
they
might
converse
more
easily
as
they
went
somewhat
slowly
past
a
piece
of
woods
patty
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
and
declared
that
she
saw
what
looked
like
a
baby
or
a
young
child
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
lying
on
the
ground
her
face
expressed
such
anxiety
as
she
thought
that
possibly
the
child
had
been
abandoned
and
left
there
purposely
that
phelps
consented
to
go
back
and
investigate
the
matter
although
he
really
thought
she
was
mistaken
in
thinking
it
was
a
child
at
all
he
turned
his
machine
and
in
a
moment
they
were
back
at
the
place
phelps
jumped
from
the
car
and
ran
into
the
wood
where
patty
pointed
sure
enough
under
a
tree
lay
a
baby
perhaps
a
year
old
fairly
well
dressed
and
with
a
pretty
smiling
face
he
called
to
patty
and
she
joined
him
where
he
stood
looking
at
the
child
why
bless
your
heart
cried
patty
picking
the
little
one
up
what
are
you
doing
here
all
alone
the
baby
cooed
and
smiled
dimpling
its
little
face
and
caressing
cheeks
with
its
fat
little
hands
a
heavy
blanket
had
been
spread
on
the
ground
for
the
child
to
lie
on
and
around
its
little
form
was
pinned
a
lighter
blanket
with
the
name
rosabel
embroidered
on
one
corner
so
that
your
name
is
it
said
patty
well
rosabel
i
like
to
know
where
you
belong
and
what
you
doing
here
do
you
suppose
she
said
turning
an
indignant
face
to
phelps
that
anybody
deliberately
put
this
child
here
and
deserted
it
i
afraid
that
what
has
happened
said
phelps
who
really
could
think
of
any
other
explanation
they
looked
all
around
but
nobody
was
in
sight
to
whom
the
child
might
possibly
belong
i
ca
go
away
and
leave
her
here
said
patty
the
dear
little
thing
what
shall
we
do
with
her
it
is
a
mighty
hard
case
said
phelps
who
was
nonplussed
himself
he
was
a
most
man
and
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
leaving
the
child
there
alone
in
the
woods
and
it
was
already
nearing
sundown
we
might
take
it
along
with
us
he
said
and
enquire
at
the
nearest
house
there
no
house
in
sight
said
patty
looking
about
well
there
are
only
two
things
to
choose
from
to
stay
here
in
hope
that
somebody
will
come
along
who
knows
something
about
this
baby
or
else
assume
that
she
really
has
been
deserted
and
take
her
home
with
us
for
the
night
at
least
i
simply
wo
go
off
and
leave
her
here
and
if
there
was
anybody
here
in
charge
of
her
they
must
have
shown
up
by
this
time
phelps
could
see
no
use
in
waiting
there
any
longer
and
though
it
seemed
absurd
to
carry
the
child
off
with
them
there
really
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
so
with
a
last
look
around
hoping
to
see
somebody
but
seeing
no
one
patty
climbed
into
the
car
and
sitting
in
the
front
seat
beside
phelps
held
the
baby
in
her
lap
she
awfully
cunning
she
declared
and
such
a
pretty
baby
whoever
abandoned
this
child
ought
to
be
fearfully
punished
in
some
way
i
ca
think
she
was
abandoned
said
phelps
but
as
he
think
of
any
other
reason
for
the
baby
being
there
alone
he
was
forced
to
accept
the
desertion
theory
having
decided
to
take
the
baby
with
them
they
sped
along
home
and
drew
up
in
front
of
the
house
to
find
nan
and
fairfield
on
the
verandah
why
how
do
you
do
mr
phelps
cried
nan
we
very
glad
to
see
you
come
in
for
gracious
goodness
sake
patty
what
have
you
got
there
this
is
rosabel
said
patty
gravely
as
she
held
the
baby
up
to
view
chapter
xix
rosabel
rosabel
who
exclaimed
nan
as
patty
came
up
on
the
verandah
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
i
do
know
i
sure
you
may
call
her
rosabel
anything
you
like
we
picked
her
up
by
the
wayside
yes
said
dick
phelps
who
had
followed
patty
up
the
steps
miss
rosabel
seemed
lonely
without
anyone
to
talk
to
so
we
brought
her
back
here
to
visit
you
you
must
be
crazy
cried
nan
but
what
a
cunning
baby
it
is
let
me
take
her
nan
took
the
little
midget
and
sat
down
in
a
verandah
rocker
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
tell
a
straight
story
patty
said
her
father
is
it
one
of
the
neighbour
children
or
did
you
kidnap
it
neither
said
patty
turning
to
her
father
we
found
the
baby
lying
right
near
the
edge
of
a
wood
in
plain
sight
from
the
road
and
there
was
nobody
around
and
papa
i
just
know
that
the
child
wretch
of
a
mother
deserted
it
and
left
it
there
to
die
nonsense
said
her
father
mothers
do
leave
their
little
ones
around
as
carelessly
as
that
well
what
else
could
it
be
said
patty
there
was
the
baby
all
alone
smiling
and
talking
to
herself
and
no
one
anywhere
near
although
we
waited
for
some
time
it
does
seem
strange
said
fairfield
perhaps
the
mother
did
mean
to
desert
the
child
but
if
so
she
was
probably
peeping
from
some
to
make
sure
that
she
approved
of
the
people
who
took
it
well
said
phelps
she
evidently
thought
we
were
all
right
at
any
rate
she
made
no
objection
but
is
it
awful
said
nan
to
think
of
anybody
deserting
a
dear
little
thing
like
this
why
the
wild
animals
might
have
eaten
her
up
of
course
they
might
said
phelps
gravely
the
tigers
and
wolves
that
abound
on
long
island
are
of
the
most
ferocious
type
well
anyway
said
patty
something
dreadful
might
have
happened
to
her
it
may
yet
said
phelps
cheerfully
when
we
take
her
back
and
put
her
in
the
place
we
found
her
for
i
do
suppose
you
intend
to
keep
miss
rosabel
do
you
i
do
know
said
patty
but
i
know
one
thing
we
certainly
wo
put
her
back
where
we
found
her
what
shall
we
do
with
her
papa
i
do
know
my
child
she
your
find
and
i
suppose
it
a
case
of
is
keepings
of
course
we
ca
keep
her
said
patty
how
ridiculous
we
have
to
put
her
in
an
orphan
asylum
or
something
like
that
it
a
shame
said
nan
to
put
this
dear
little
mite
in
a
horrid
old
asylum
i
think
i
shall
adopt
her
myself
little
rosabel
had
begun
to
grow
restless
and
suddenly
without
a
word
of
warning
she
began
to
cry
lustily
and
not
a
quiet
cry
either
but
with
shrieks
and
yells
indicative
of
great
discomfort
of
some
sort
i
changed
my
mind
said
nan
abruptly
i
do
want
to
adopt
any
such
noisy
young
person
as
that
here
take
her
patty
she
your
property
patty
took
the
baby
and
carried
her
into
the
house
fearing
that
would
think
they
must
be
torturing
the
child
to
make
her
scream
like
that
into
the
went
patty
and
on
to
the
kitchen
where
she
announced
to
the
astonished
cook
that
she
wanted
some
milk
for
the
baby
and
she
wanted
it
quick
is
there
company
for
dinner
miss
patty
asked
the
cook
not
understanding
how
a
baby
could
have
arrived
as
an
only
guest
only
this
one
said
patty
laughing
what
do
you
think
she
ought
to
eat
bread
and
milk
said
the
cook
looking
at
the
child
with
a
judicial
air
all
right
kate
fix
her
some
wo
you
in
a
few
moments
patty
was
feeding
rosabel
bread
and
milk
which
the
child
ate
eagerly
impelled
by
curiosity
nan
came
to
the
kitchen
followed
by
the
two
men
i
thought
she
must
be
asleep
said
nan
as
the
concert
seems
to
have
stopped
not
at
all
said
patty
calmly
she
was
only
hungry
and
the
fact
seemed
to
occur
to
her
somewhat
suddenly
little
rosabel
all
smiles
again
looked
up
from
her
supper
with
such
bewitching
glances
that
nan
cried
out
oh
she
is
a
darling
let
me
help
you
feed
her
patty
in
fact
they
all
succumbed
to
the
charm
of
their
uninvited
guest
during
dinner
rosabel
sat
at
the
table
in
a
chair
filled
with
pillows
and
was
made
happy
by
being
given
many
dainty
bits
of
various
delicacies
until
nan
declared
the
child
would
certainly
be
i
do
believe
she
is
more
than
a
year
old
said
nan
and
probably
unaccustomed
to
those
rich
cakes
and
bonbons
i
think
she
more
than
a
year
said
patty
sagely
and
anyway
i
want
her
to
have
a
good
time
for
once
she
seems
to
be
having
the
time
of
her
life
said
dick
phelps
as
he
watched
the
baby
who
with
a
macaroon
in
one
hand
and
some
candied
cherries
in
the
other
was
smiling
impartially
on
them
all
she
not
much
of
a
conversationalist
remarked
fairfield
give
her
time
said
patty
she
feels
a
little
strange
at
first
yes
said
phelps
i
think
after
two
or
three
years
she
be
much
more
talkative
well
there
one
thing
certain
said
patty
she
have
to
stay
here
whatever
we
do
with
her
illustration
in
a
few
minutes
patty
was
feeding
rosabel
bread
and
milk
after
dinner
they
took
their
new
toy
with
them
to
the
parlour
and
miss
rosabel
treated
them
all
to
a
few
more
winning
smiles
and
then
quietly
but
very
decidedly
fell
asleep
in
patty
arms
i
ca
help
admiring
her
decision
of
character
said
patty
as
she
shook
the
baby
to
make
her
awaken
but
without
success
do
wake
her
up
said
nan
come
patty
we
take
her
upstairs
and
put
her
to
bed
somewhere
this
feat
being
accomplished
nan
and
patty
rejoined
the
men
who
sat
smoking
on
the
front
verandah
now
said
patty
we
really
must
decide
what
we
going
to
do
with
that
infant
for
i
warn
you
papa
fairfield
that
if
we
keep
that
dear
baby
around
much
longer
i
shall
become
so
attached
to
her
that
i
give
her
up
of
course
said
fairfield
she
must
be
turned
over
to
the
authorities
i
attend
to
it
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
a
little
later
fairfield
and
nan
strolled
down
the
road
to
make
a
call
on
a
neighbour
and
patty
and
dick
phelps
remained
at
home
patty
had
declared
she
would
leave
the
house
lest
rosabel
should
waken
and
cry
out
so
promising
to
make
but
a
short
call
fairfield
and
nan
went
away
soon
after
they
had
gone
a
strange
young
man
came
walking
toward
the
house
he
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
approached
the
front
steps
is
this
richard
phelps
he
asked
addressing
himself
to
dick
it
is
what
can
i
do
for
you
do
you
own
a
large
black
racing
automobile
yes
replied
phelps
and
were
you
out
in
it
this
afternoon
continued
the
stranger
driving
rapidly
between
here
and
north
point
yes
said
phelps
again
wondering
what
was
the
intent
of
this
peculiar
interview
then
you
the
man
i
after
declared
the
stranger
and
i
obliged
to
tell
you
sir
that
you
are
under
arrest
for
what
offence
enquired
phelps
rather
amused
at
what
he
considered
a
good
joke
and
thinking
that
it
must
be
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
somehow
for
kidnapping
little
mary
brown
was
the
astonishing
reply
why
we
did
kidnap
her
at
all
exclaimed
patty
breaking
into
the
conversation
the
idea
to
think
we
would
kidnap
a
baby
and
anyway
her
name
is
mary
it
rosabel
then
you
know
where
the
child
is
miss
said
the
man
turning
to
patty
of
course
i
do
said
patty
she
upstairs
asleep
but
it
is
mary
brown
at
all
it
rosabel
i
do
know
what
her
last
name
is
phelps
began
to
be
interested
what
makes
you
think
we
kidnapped
a
baby
my
friend
he
said
to
their
visitor
the
man
looked
as
if
he
had
begun
to
think
there
must
be
a
mistake
somewhere
why
you
see
sir
he
said
brown
she
just
about
crazy
her
little
girl
sarah
went
out
into
the
woods
this
afternoon
and
took
the
baby
mary
with
her
the
baby
went
to
sleep
and
sarah
left
it
lying
on
a
blanket
under
a
tree
while
she
roamed
around
the
wood
picking
blueberries
somehow
she
strayed
away
farther
than
she
intended
and
lost
her
way
when
she
finally
managed
to
get
back
to
the
place
where
she
left
the
baby
the
child
was
gone
and
she
says
she
could
see
a
large
automobile
going
swiftly
away
and
the
lady
who
sat
in
the
front
seat
was
holding
little
mary
sarah
screamed
and
called
after
you
but
the
car
only
went
on
more
and
more
rapidly
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
i
a
detective
sir
and
i
looked
carefully
at
the
wheel
tracks
in
the
dust
and
i
asked
a
few
questions
here
and
there
and
i
hit
upon
some
several
clues
and
here
i
am
now
i
like
you
to
explain
sir
if
you
kidnap
that
child
what
you
do
call
it
why
it
was
a
rescue
cried
patty
indignantly
without
giving
phelps
time
to
reply
the
dear
little
baby
was
all
alone
in
the
wood
and
anything
might
have
happened
to
her
her
mother
had
no
business
to
let
her
be
taken
care
of
by
a
sister
that
could
take
care
of
her
any
better
than
that
we
waited
for
some
time
and
nobody
appeared
so
we
picked
up
the
child
and
brought
her
home
rather
than
leave
her
there
alone
but
i
do
believe
it
the
child
you
after
anyway
for
the
name
rosabel
is
embroidered
on
the
blanket
it
is
the
same
child
miss
said
the
man
who
somehow
seemed
a
little
crestfallen
because
his
kidnapping
case
proved
to
be
only
in
his
own
imagination
brown
described
to
me
the
clothes
the
baby
wore
and
she
said
that
blanket
was
given
to
her
by
a
rich
lady
who
had
a
little
girl
named
rosabel
the
browns
are
poor
people
and
the
mother
is
a
woman
and
she
nearly
crazed
with
grief
about
the
baby
i
should
think
she
would
be
said
patty
whose
quick
sympathies
had
already
flown
to
the
sorrowing
mother
she
ought
to
have
left
an
irresponsible
child
in
charge
of
the
little
thing
but
it
dreadful
to
think
how
anxious
she
must
be
now
i
tell
you
what
we
do
phelps
if
you
get
out
your
car
i
just
bundle
that
child
up
and
we
take
her
right
straight
back
home
to
her
mother
we
stop
at
the
ripleys
for
papa
and
nan
and
we
all
go
over
together
it
a
lovely
moonlight
night
for
a
drive
anyway
and
even
if
it
were
pitch
dark
or
pouring
in
torrents
i
should
want
to
get
that
baby
back
to
her
mother
just
as
quickly
as
possible
i
do
wonder
the
poor
woman
is
distracted
very
well
said
phelps
who
would
have
driven
his
car
to
kamschatka
if
patty
had
asked
him
to
and
we
take
this
gentleman
along
with
us
to
direct
us
to
mrs
brown
phelps
went
for
his
car
and
patty
flew
to
bundle
up
the
baby
she
did
not
dress
the
child
but
wrapped
her
in
a
warm
blanket
and
then
in
a
cape
of
her
own
then
making
a
bundle
of
the
baby
clothes
she
presented
herself
at
the
door
just
as
phelps
drove
up
with
his
splendid
great
car
shining
in
the
moonlight
a
few
moments
pause
was
sufficient
to
gather
in
and
fairfield
and
away
they
all
flew
through
the
night
to
brown
humble
cottage
they
found
the
poor
woman
not
only
grieving
about
the
loss
of
her
child
but
angry
and
revengeful
against
the
lady
and
gentleman
in
the
who
she
thought
had
stolen
it
and
so
when
the
car
stopped
in
front
of
her
door
she
came
running
out
followed
by
her
husband
and
several
children
little
sarah
recognised
the
car
which
was
unusual
in
size
and
shape
and
cried
out
that
the
one
that
the
one
mother
and
those
are
the
people
who
stole
mary
but
the
young
detective
whose
name
was
faulks
sprang
out
of
the
car
and
began
to
explain
matters
to
the
astonished
family
then
patty
handed
out
the
baby
and
the
grief
of
the
browns
was
quickly
turned
to
rejoicing
mingled
with
apologies
fairfield
explained
further
to
the
somewhat
bewildered
mother
and
leaving
with
her
a
substantial
present
of
money
as
an
evidence
of
good
faith
in
the
matter
he
returned
to
his
place
in
the
car
and
in
a
moment
they
were
whizzing
back
toward
home
i
glad
it
all
turned
out
right
said
patty
with
a
sigh
but
i
do
wish
that
pretty
baby
had
been
named
rosabel
instead
of
mary
it
really
would
have
suited
her
a
great
deal
better
chapter
xx
the
rolands
there
a
new
family
in
that
house
across
the
road
said
fairfield
one
evening
at
dinner
the
fenwick
house
asked
nan
yes
a
man
named
roland
has
taken
it
for
august
i
know
a
man
who
knows
them
and
he
says
they
charming
people
so
if
you
ladies
want
to
be
neighbourly
you
might
call
on
them
nan
and
patty
went
to
call
and
found
the
roland
family
very
pleasant
people
indeed
roland
seemed
to
be
an
sort
of
lady
who
never
took
any
trouble
herself
and
never
expected
anyone
else
to
do
so
miss
roland
patty
decided
was
a
rather
inanimate
young
person
and
showed
a
lack
of
energy
so
at
variance
with
patty
tastes
that
she
confided
to
nan
on
the
way
home
she
certainly
did
not
expect
to
cultivate
any
such
lackadaisical
girl
as
that
as
for
young
roland
the
son
of
the
house
patty
had
great
ado
to
keep
from
laughing
outright
at
him
he
was
of
the
foppish
sort
and
though
young
and
rather
callow
he
assumed
airs
of
great
importance
and
addressed
patty
with
a
formal
deference
as
if
she
were
a
young
lady
in
society
instead
of
a
schoolgirl
patty
was
accustomed
to
frank
pleasant
comradeship
with
the
boys
of
her
acquaintance
and
the
young
men
such
as
hepworth
and
phelps
treated
patty
as
a
little
girl
and
never
seemed
to
imply
anything
like
attentions
but
young
roland
with
an
affected
drawl
and
what
were
meant
to
be
killing
glances
of
admiration
so
conducted
himself
that
patty
sense
of
humour
was
stirred
and
she
mischievously
led
him
on
for
the
fun
of
seeing
what
he
would
do
next
the
result
was
that
young
roland
was
much
pleased
with
pretty
patty
and
fully
believed
that
his
own
charms
had
made
a
decided
impression
on
her
he
asked
permission
to
call
whereupon
patty
told
him
that
she
was
only
a
schoolgirl
and
did
not
receive
calls
from
young
men
but
referred
him
to
fairfield
and
nan
being
in
an
amiable
mood
kindly
gave
him
the
desired
permission
well
said
patty
as
they
discussed
the
matter
afterward
if
that
young
rolls
himself
over
here
you
can
have
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
him
i
quite
ready
to
admit
that
another
season
of
his
conversation
would
affect
my
mind
nonsense
said
nan
carelessly
you
ca
expect
every
young
man
to
be
as
interesting
as
hepworth
or
as
companionable
as
kenneth
harper
i
do
said
patty
but
i
do
have
to
bore
myself
to
death
talking
to
them
if
i
do
like
them
no
said
nan
but
you
must
be
polite
and
amiable
to
everybody
part
of
the
penalty
of
being
an
attractive
young
woman
all
right
said
patty
since
that
the
way
you
look
at
it
you
surely
ca
have
any
objection
to
receiving
roland
if
he
calls
for
i
warn
you
that
i
sha
appear
but
it
so
happened
that
when
a
caller
came
one
afternoon
nan
was
not
at
home
and
patty
was
the
maid
brought
the
card
to
patty
who
was
reading
in
her
own
room
and
when
she
looked
at
it
and
saw
the
name
of
charles
roland
upon
it
she
exclaimed
in
dismay
i
do
want
to
go
down
she
said
i
wish
he
had
come
it
a
lady
miss
patty
said
the
girl
a
lady
said
patty
wonderingly
why
this
is
a
gentleman
card
yes
i
know
it
but
it
a
lady
that
called
she
down
in
the
parlour
waiting
and
that
the
card
she
gave
me
she
a
large
lady
miss
patty
with
greyish
hair
and
she
seems
in
a
terrible
fluster
very
mysterious
said
patty
but
i
go
down
and
see
what
it
all
about
patty
went
down
to
the
parlour
and
found
roland
there
she
did
indeed
look
bewildered
and
as
soon
as
patty
entered
the
room
she
began
to
talk
volubly
excuse
my
rushing
over
like
this
my
dear
she
said
but
i
am
in
such
trouble
and
i
wonder
if
you
wo
help
me
out
we
neighbours
you
know
and
i
sure
i
do
as
much
for
you
i
asked
for
fairfield
but
she
is
at
home
so
i
asked
for
you
but
the
card
you
sent
up
had
charles
roland
name
on
it
said
patty
smiling
oh
my
dear
is
that
so
what
a
mistake
to
make
you
see
i
carry
charlie
cards
around
with
my
own
and
i
must
have
sent
the
wrong
one
i
so
nearsighted
i
ca
see
anything
without
my
glasses
anyway
and
my
glasses
are
always
lost
patty
felt
sorry
for
the
old
lady
who
seemed
in
such
a
bewildered
state
and
she
said
no
matter
about
the
card
roland
what
can
i
do
for
you
why
it
just
this
said
her
visitor
i
want
to
borrow
your
house
just
for
the
night
i
return
it
in
perfect
order
borrow
this
house
repeated
patty
wondering
if
her
guest
were
really
sane
yes
said
roland
now
wait
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
expecting
some
friends
to
dinner
and
to
stay
over
night
and
would
you
believe
it
just
now
of
all
days
in
the
year
the
tank
has
burst
and
the
water
is
dripping
down
all
through
the
house
we
ca
seem
to
do
anything
to
stop
it
the
ceilings
had
fallen
in
three
rooms
when
i
came
away
and
i
dare
say
the
rest
of
them
are
down
by
this
time
and
my
friends
are
very
particular
people
and
awfully
exclusive
i
like
to
take
them
to
the
hotel
and
i
do
think
it
a
very
nice
hotel
anyway
and
so
i
thought
if
you
just
lend
me
this
house
over
night
i
could
bring
my
friends
right
here
and
as
they
leave
morning
it
would
be
long
you
know
and
truly
i
do
see
what
else
i
can
do
but
what
would
become
of
our
family
said
patty
who
was
greatly
amused
at
the
unconventional
request
why
you
could
go
to
our
house
said
roland
dubiously
that
is
if
any
of
the
ceilings
will
stay
up
over
night
or
she
added
her
face
brightening
could
you
go
to
the
hotel
yourselves
of
course
it
is
a
nice
place
to
entertain
guests
but
it
does
very
well
for
own
family
oh
miss
fairfield
please
help
me
out
truly
i
do
as
much
for
you
if
the
case
were
reversed
although
the
request
was
unusual
roland
did
not
seem
to
think
so
and
the
poor
lady
seemed
to
be
in
such
distress
that
patty
sympathies
were
aroused
and
after
all
it
was
a
mere
neighbourly
act
of
kindness
to
borrow
and
lend
even
though
the
article
in
question
was
somewhat
larger
than
the
lemon
or
the
egg
usually
borrowed
by
neighbourly
housekeepers
so
patty
said
what
about
the
servants
roland
do
you
want
to
borrow
them
too
i
do
care
was
the
reply
just
as
it
suits
you
best
you
may
leave
them
here
or
take
them
with
you
and
i
bring
my
own
oh
please
miss
fairfield
do
help
me
somehow
patty
thought
a
minute
it
was
a
responsibility
to
decide
the
question
herself
but
if
she
waited
until
nan
or
her
father
came
home
it
would
be
too
late
for
roland
purpose
then
she
said
i
do
it
roland
you
shall
have
the
house
and
servants
at
your
disposal
until
noon
you
may
bring
your
own
servants
also
or
not
just
as
you
choose
we
wo
go
to
your
house
thank
you
nor
to
the
hotel
but
and
fairfield
and
myself
will
go
over
to
my
aunt
barlow
to
dine
and
spend
the
night
they
can
put
us
up
and
they
wo
mind
a
bit
our
coming
so
unexpectedly
oh
my
dear
how
good
you
are
said
roland
in
a
burst
of
gratitude
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
appreciate
your
kindness
are
you
sure
your
parents
wo
mind
i
not
at
all
sure
of
that
said
patty
smiling
but
i
do
see
as
they
can
help
themselves
when
they
come
home
you
will
probably
be
in
possession
and
your
guests
will
be
here
so
there
be
nothing
for
my
people
to
do
but
to
fall
in
with
my
plans
oh
how
good
you
are
said
roland
i
will
surely
make
this
up
to
you
in
some
way
and
now
will
you
just
show
me
about
the
house
a
bit
as
i
never
been
here
before
so
patty
piloted
roland
about
the
house
showed
her
the
various
rooms
and
told
the
servants
that
they
were
at
roland
orders
for
that
night
and
the
next
morning
after
roland
had
gone
back
home
made
happy
by
patty
kindness
patty
began
to
think
that
she
had
done
a
very
extraordinary
thing
and
wondered
what
her
father
and
nan
would
say
but
she
thought
to
herself
i
in
for
it
now
and
they
have
to
abide
by
my
decision
whatever
they
think
now
i
must
pack
some
things
for
our
visit
but
first
i
must
telephone
to
aunt
grace
hello
auntie
said
patty
at
the
telephone
a
few
moments
later
papa
and
nan
and
i
want
to
come
over
to
the
to
dinner
and
to
stay
all
night
will
you
have
us
why
of
course
patty
child
we
glad
to
have
you
come
right
along
and
stay
as
long
as
you
like
but
what
the
matter
has
your
cook
left
or
is
the
house
on
fire
neither
aunt
grace
but
i
explain
when
i
get
there
can
you
send
somebody
after
me
in
a
carriage
papa
and
nan
have
gone
off
in
the
cart
and
i
have
two
suit
cases
to
bring
certainly
patty
i
send
old
dill
after
you
right
away
and
i
make
him
hurry
too
as
you
seem
to
be
anxious
to
start
i
am
said
patty
laughing
then
she
gathered
together
such
clothing
and
belongings
as
were
necessary
for
their
visit
and
had
two
suit
cases
ready
packed
when
her
carriage
came
for
her
patty
looked
a
little
dubious
as
she
left
the
house
but
she
did
feel
that
she
could
have
acted
otherwise
than
as
she
had
done
and
too
since
their
own
trusty
servants
were
to
stay
there
certainly
no
harm
could
come
to
the
place
so
giggling
at
the
whole
performance
patty
jumped
into
the
barlow
carriage
and
went
to
the
well
of
all
things
said
her
aunt
grace
after
patty
had
told
her
story
i
had
a
suspicion
sometimes
that
we
barlows
were
an
unconventional
crowd
but
we
never
borrowed
anybody
house
yet
ridiculous
patty
and
you
ought
not
to
have
let
that
woman
have
it
i
just
could
help
it
aunt
grace
she
was
in
such
a
twitter
and
threw
herself
on
my
mercy
in
such
a
way
that
i
felt
i
had
to
help
her
out
you
too
patty
you
do
anything
for
anybody
who
asked
you
you
need
talk
aunt
grace
you
just
the
same
yourself
and
you
know
that
if
somebody
came
along
this
minute
and
wanted
to
borrow
your
house
you
let
her
have
it
if
she
coaxed
hard
enough
i
think
very
likely
said
aunt
grace
placidly
now
how
are
you
going
to
catch
your
father
and
nan
why
they
have
to
drive
past
here
on
their
way
home
said
patty
and
i
mean
to
stop
them
and
tell
them
about
it
we
can
put
the
horse
in
your
barn
i
suppose
yes
of
course
and
now
we
go
out
on
the
verandah
and
then
we
can
see
the
fairfield
when
it
comes
along
the
fairfields
were
waylaid
and
stopped
as
they
drove
by
the
house
which
was
not
astonishing
as
patty
and
bumble
and
barlow
watched
from
the
piazza
while
bob
was
perched
on
the
front
gate
post
and
uncle
ted
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
walk
what
the
matter
cried
fairfield
as
he
reined
up
his
horse
in
response
to
their
various
salutations
the
matter
is
said
patty
that
we
have
any
home
of
our
own
and
so
we
visiting
aunt
grace
earthquake
swallowed
our
house
inquired
fairfield
as
he
turned
to
drive
in
not
quite
said
patty
but
one
of
the
neighbours
wanted
to
borrow
it
so
i
lent
it
to
her
that
roland
i
suppose
said
nan
she
probably
mislaid
her
own
house
she
so
careless
and
it
was
roland
said
patty
laughing
and
she
having
a
and
their
tank
burst
and
most
of
the
ceilings
fell
and
really
nan
you
know
yourself
such
things
do
upset
a
house
if
they
occur
on
the
day
of
a
fuller
explanations
ensued
and
though
the
fairfields
thought
it
a
crazy
piece
of
business
they
agreed
with
patty
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
refuse
roland
request
and
it
really
did
interfere
with
the
at
all
and
the
barlows
protested
that
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
them
to
entertain
their
friends
so
unexpectedly
so
as
fairfield
declared
roland
was
after
all
a
public
benefactor
you
better
wait
said
nan
until
you
see
the
house
i
know
a
little
about
the
rolands
and
i
would
be
a
bit
surprised
to
find
things
pretty
much
upside
down
it
was
nearly
noon
the
next
day
when
roland
telephoned
to
the
and
asked
for
fairfield
nan
responded
and
was
told
that
the
rolands
were
now
leaving
and
that
the
fairfields
might
again
come
into
their
home
roland
also
expressed
voluble
thanks
for
the
great
service
the
fairfields
had
done
her
and
said
that
she
would
call
the
next
day
to
thank
them
in
person
so
the
fairfields
went
back
home
and
happily
nan
fears
were
not
realised
nothing
seemed
to
be
spoiled
or
out
of
order
and
the
servants
said
that
roland
and
her
family
and
friends
had
been
most
kind
and
had
made
no
trouble
at
all
now
you
see
said
patty
triumphantly
that
it
does
no
harm
to
do
a
kind
deed
to
a
neighbour
once
in
a
while
even
though
it
is
the
particular
kind
deed
that
you
done
a
hundred
times
before
that
true
enough
patty
said
her
father
but
all
the
same
when
you
lend
our
home
again
let
it
be
our
own
house
and
furnished
with
our
own
things
i
do
mind
owning
up
now
that
it
all
over
that
i
did
feel
a
certain
anxiety
arising
from
the
fact
that
this
is
a
rented
house
and
almost
none
of
the
household
appointments
are
our
own
goodness
gracious
me
said
patty
i
never
once
thought
of
that
well
i
glad
they
did
smash
all
the
china
and
for
mortal
homely
and
i
should
certainly
begrudge
the
money
it
would
take
to
replace
them
chapter
xxi
the
crusoes
plans
were
on
foot
for
a
huge
fair
and
bazaar
to
be
held
in
aid
of
the
associated
charities
everybody
in
and
around
sandy
cove
was
interested
and
the
fair
which
would
be
held
the
last
week
in
august
was
expected
to
eclipse
all
previous
efforts
of
its
kind
all
three
of
the
fairfields
were
energetically
assisting
in
the
work
and
each
was
a
member
of
several
important
committees
the
barlows
too
were
working
hard
and
the
rolands
thought
they
were
doing
so
though
somehow
they
accomplished
very
little
as
the
time
drew
near
for
the
bazaar
to
open
patty
grew
so
excited
over
the
work
and
had
such
a
multitude
of
responsibilities
that
she
flew
around
as
madly
as
when
she
was
preparing
for
the
play
at
school
but
i
perfectly
well
now
she
said
to
her
father
when
he
remonstrated
with
her
and
i
do
mind
how
hard
i
work
as
long
as
i
have
lessons
to
study
at
the
same
time
aside
from
assisting
with
various
booths
and
tables
patty
had
charge
of
a
gypsy
encampment
which
she
spared
no
pains
to
make
as
gay
and
interesting
as
possible
the
romany
rest
she
called
the
little
enclosure
which
was
to
represent
the
and
patty
not
only
superintended
the
furnishing
and
arranging
of
the
place
but
also
directed
the
details
of
the
costumes
which
were
to
be
worn
by
the
young
people
who
were
to
represent
gypsies
the
fairfields
house
was
filled
with
guests
who
had
come
down
for
the
fair
patty
had
invited
elise
and
roger
farrington
and
bertha
and
winthrop
warner
hepworth
and
kenneth
harper
were
there
too
and
the
merry
crowd
of
young
people
worked
zealously
in
their
endeavours
to
assist
patty
and
nan
hepworth
of
course
was
especially
helpful
in
arranging
the
gypsy
encampment
and
designing
the
picturesque
costumes
for
the
girls
and
young
men
who
were
to
act
as
gypsies
the
white
blouses
with
scarfs
and
broad
sombreros
were
beautiful
to
look
at
even
if
as
patty
said
they
were
more
like
spanish
fandangoes
than
like
any
gypsy
garments
she
had
ever
seen
do
expose
your
ignorance
my
child
said
hepworth
smiling
at
her
a
romany
is
not
an
ordinary
gypsy
and
is
always
clothed
in
this
particular
kind
of
garb
then
that
all
that
necessary
said
patty
i
bow
to
your
superior
judgment
and
i
feel
sure
that
all
the
patrons
of
the
fair
will
spend
most
of
their
time
at
the
rest
the
day
on
which
the
fair
was
to
open
was
a
busy
one
and
everybody
was
up
betimes
getting
ready
for
the
grand
event
a
fancy
dress
parade
was
to
be
one
of
the
features
of
the
first
evening
and
as
a
prize
was
offered
for
the
cleverest
costume
all
of
the
contestants
were
carefully
guarding
the
secret
of
the
characters
their
costumes
would
represent
although
roger
had
given
no
hint
of
what
his
costume
was
to
be
he
calmly
announced
that
he
knew
it
would
take
the
prize
the
others
laughed
thinking
this
a
jest
and
patty
was
of
a
private
opinion
that
probably
hepworth
costume
would
be
cleverer
than
roger
as
the
artist
had
most
original
and
ingenious
ideas
the
fair
was
to
open
at
three
in
the
afternoon
and
soon
after
twelve
patty
rushed
into
the
house
looking
for
somebody
to
send
on
an
errand
she
found
no
one
about
but
bertha
warner
who
was
hastily
putting
some
finishing
touches
to
her
own
gypsy
dress
that
almost
finished
is
it
bertha
began
patty
breathlessly
yes
why
can
i
help
you
in
any
way
indeed
you
can
if
you
will
i
have
to
go
over
to
black
island
for
some
goldenrod
it
does
grow
anywhere
else
as
early
at
least
i
ca
find
any
i
hunted
all
over
for
somebody
to
send
but
the
boys
are
all
so
busy
and
so
i
just
going
myself
i
wish
you
come
along
and
help
me
row
it
ever
so
much
quicker
to
go
across
in
a
boat
and
get
it
there
than
to
drive
out
into
the
country
for
it
of
course
i
will
said
bertha
but
will
there
be
time
yes
if
we
scoot
right
along
the
girls
flew
down
to
the
dock
jumped
into
a
small
rowboat
and
began
to
row
briskly
over
to
black
island
it
was
not
very
far
and
they
soon
reached
it
they
scrambled
out
pulled
the
boat
well
up
onto
the
beach
and
went
after
the
flowers
sure
enough
as
patty
had
said
there
was
a
luxuriant
growth
of
goldenrod
in
many
parts
of
the
island
patty
had
brought
a
pair
of
garden
shears
and
by
setting
to
work
vigorously
they
soon
had
as
much
as
they
could
carry
there
said
patty
triumphantly
as
she
tied
up
two
great
sheaves
i
believe
we
gathered
that
quicker
than
if
we
had
brought
some
boys
along
to
help
now
let
skip
for
home
the
island
was
not
very
large
but
in
their
search
for
the
flowers
they
had
wandered
farther
than
they
thought
it
nearly
one
said
patty
looking
at
her
watch
and
carrying
their
heavy
cargo
of
golden
flowers
they
hastened
back
to
where
they
had
left
their
boat
but
no
boat
was
there
oh
bertha
cried
patty
the
boat
has
drifted
away
oh
pshaw
said
bertha
i
do
believe
it
we
pulled
it
ever
so
far
up
on
the
sand
well
then
where
is
it
why
i
believe
winthrop
or
kenneth
or
somebody
came
over
and
pulled
it
away
just
to
tease
us
i
believe
they
around
the
corner
waiting
for
us
now
patty
tried
to
take
this
view
of
it
but
she
felt
a
strange
sinking
of
her
heart
for
it
was
like
kenneth
to
play
a
practical
joke
and
she
did
think
winthrop
would
either
laying
down
her
bundle
of
flowers
bertha
ran
around
the
end
of
the
island
fully
expecting
to
see
her
brother
laughing
face
but
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
and
no
sign
of
the
boat
then
bertha
became
alarmed
and
the
two
girls
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
look
off
there
cried
patty
suddenly
pointing
out
on
the
water
far
away
they
saw
an
empty
boat
dancing
along
in
the
sunlight
bertha
began
to
cry
and
though
patty
felt
like
it
it
seemed
really
too
babyish
and
she
said
do
be
a
goose
bertha
we
not
lost
on
a
desert
island
and
of
course
somebody
will
come
after
us
anyway
but
patty
was
worried
more
than
she
would
admit
for
no
one
knew
where
they
had
gone
and
the
empty
boat
was
drifting
away
from
sandy
cove
instead
of
toward
it
at
first
the
girls
were
buoyed
up
by
the
excitement
of
the
situation
and
felt
that
somebody
must
find
them
shortly
but
no
other
boat
was
in
sight
and
as
patty
said
everybody
was
getting
ready
for
the
fair
and
no
one
was
likely
to
go
out
rowing
that
day
one
came
and
then
one
and
though
the
girls
had
tried
to
invent
some
way
out
of
their
difficulty
they
could
think
of
a
thing
to
do
but
sit
still
and
wait
they
had
tied
their
handkerchiefs
on
the
highest
bushes
of
the
island
there
being
no
trees
but
they
well
knew
that
these
tiny
white
signals
were
not
likely
to
attract
attention
they
had
shouted
until
they
were
hoarse
and
they
had
talked
over
all
the
possibilities
of
the
case
of
course
they
have
missed
us
by
this
time
said
patty
and
of
course
they
are
looking
for
us
i
do
believe
they
are
said
bertha
disconsolately
because
all
the
people
at
the
house
will
think
we
down
at
the
fair
grounds
and
all
the
people
there
will
think
we
up
at
the
house
that
so
patty
admitted
for
she
well
knew
how
everybody
was
concerned
with
his
or
her
own
work
for
the
fair
and
how
little
thought
they
would
be
giving
to
one
another
at
this
particular
time
and
yet
though
patty
would
not
mention
it
and
would
scarcely
admit
the
thought
to
herself
she
could
help
feeling
sure
that
hepworth
would
be
wondering
where
she
was
the
only
hope
is
she
said
to
bertha
if
somebody
should
want
to
see
me
especially
about
some
of
the
work
and
should
try
to
hunt
me
up
well
said
bertha
even
if
they
did
it
never
would
occur
to
them
that
we
are
over
here
no
they
never
think
of
that
even
if
they
do
miss
us
and
try
to
hunt
for
us
they
only
telephone
to
different
houses
or
something
like
that
it
will
never
occur
to
them
that
we
over
here
and
why
should
it
i
glad
i
came
with
you
said
bertha
affectionately
i
should
hate
to
think
of
you
over
here
all
alone
if
i
were
here
alone
said
patty
laughing
you
would
be
thinking
of
me
as
here
alone
you
just
be
wondering
where
i
was
so
i
would
said
bertha
laughing
too
but
oh
patty
do
let
do
it
fearful
to
sit
here
helpless
like
this
i
know
it
said
patty
but
what
can
we
do
we
just
like
robinson
crusoe
and
his
man
friday
except
that
we
have
any
goat
no
and
we
have
any
raft
from
which
to
select
that
array
of
useful
articles
that
he
had
at
his
disposal
do
you
remember
the
little
bag
that
always
held
everything
that
could
possibly
be
required
oh
that
was
in
family
robinson
said
patty
your
early
education
is
getting
mixed
up
i
hope
being
cast
on
a
desert
island
has
affected
your
brain
i
do
want
to
be
over
here
with
a
lunatic
you
will
be
if
this
keeps
up
much
longer
said
poor
bertha
who
was
of
an
emotional
nature
and
was
bravely
trying
hard
not
to
cry
we
might
make
a
fire
said
patty
if
we
only
had
some
paper
and
matches
i
do
know
what
good
a
fire
would
do
nobody
would
think
that
meant
anything
especial
i
wish
we
could
put
up
a
bigger
signal
of
some
sort
we
have
any
bigger
signal
and
if
we
had
we
have
any
way
of
raising
it
any
higher
than
these
silly
low
bushes
i
never
saw
an
island
so
poorly
furnished
for
the
accommodation
of
two
young
lady
crusoes
i
never
did
either
i
going
to
shout
again
do
if
it
amuses
you
but
truly
they
ca
hear
you
it
too
far
what
do
you
think
will
happen
patty
do
you
suppose
we
have
to
stay
here
all
night
i
do
know
said
patty
slowly
of
course
when
it
time
for
the
fair
to
open
and
we
not
there
they
miss
us
and
of
course
papa
will
begin
a
search
at
once
but
the
trouble
is
bertha
they
never
think
of
searching
over
here
they
look
in
every
other
direction
but
they
never
dream
that
we
came
out
in
the
boat
so
the
girls
sat
and
waited
growing
more
and
more
with
that
peculiar
despondency
which
accompanies
enforced
idleness
in
a
desperate
situation
look
cried
patty
suddenly
and
startled
bertha
looked
where
patty
pointed
yes
surely
a
boat
had
put
out
from
the
shore
and
was
coming
toward
them
at
least
it
was
headed
for
the
island
though
not
directly
toward
where
they
sat
they
going
to
land
farther
down
cried
patty
excitedly
come
on
bertha
the
two
girls
rushed
along
the
narrow
rough
beach
wildly
waving
their
handkerchiefs
at
the
occupants
of
the
boat
it
hepworth
cried
patty
though
the
knowledge
seemed
to
come
to
her
intuitively
even
before
she
recognised
the
man
who
held
the
stroke
oar
and
winthrop
is
rowing
too
said
bertha
recognising
her
brother
and
i
think
that
kenneth
harper
steering
by
this
time
the
boat
was
near
enough
to
prove
that
these
surmises
were
correct
relieved
of
her
anxiety
mischievous
patty
in
the
reaction
of
the
moment
assumed
a
saucy
and
indifferent
air
and
as
the
boat
crunched
its
keel
along
the
pebbly
beach
she
called
out
gaily
how
do
you
do
are
you
coming
to
call
on
us
we
camping
here
for
the
summer
you
little
rascals
cried
winthrop
warner
what
do
you
mean
by
running
away
in
this
fashion
and
upsetting
the
whole
bazaar
and
driving
all
your
friends
crazy
with
anxiety
about
you
our
boat
drifted
away
said
bertha
and
we
could
catch
it
and
we
thought
we
have
to
stay
here
all
night
i
did
think
we
would
said
patty
i
felt
sure
somebody
would
come
after
us
i
do
know
why
you
thought
so
said
winthrop
for
nobody
knew
where
you
were
i
know
that
said
patty
smiling
and
yet
i
ca
tell
you
why
but
i
just
felt
sure
that
somebody
would
come
in
a
boat
and
carry
us
safely
home
whom
did
you
expect
asked
kenneth
me
patty
looked
at
kenneth
and
then
at
hepworth
and
then
dropping
her
eyes
demurely
she
said
i
did
know
would
come
only
i
just
knew
would
well
somebody
did
said
kenneth
as
he
stowed
the
great
bunches
of
goldenrod
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
yes
somebody
did
said
patty
softly
flashing
a
tiny
smile
at
hepworth
who
said
nothing
but
he
smiled
a
little
too
as
he
bent
to
his
oars
chapter
xxii
the
bazaar
of
all
nations
how
did
you
know
where
we
were
said
bertha
to
her
brother
we
did
know
said
winthrop
but
after
we
had
hunted
everywhere
and
put
a
squad
of
policemen
on
your
track
and
got
out
the
fire
department
and
sent
for
an
ambulance
hepworth
here
did
a
little
detective
work
on
his
own
account
what
did
you
do
asked
patty
why
nothing
much
said
hepworth
i
just
tried
to
account
for
the
various
boats
and
when
i
found
one
was
missing
i
thought
you
must
have
gone
on
the
water
somewhere
and
so
i
got
a
field
glass
and
looked
all
around
and
though
i
thought
i
saw
your
white
flags
fluttering
i
sure
but
i
put
over
here
on
the
chance
seems
to
me
said
kenneth
hepworth
is
a
good
deal
like
that
man
in
the
story
a
horse
had
strayed
away
and
several
people
had
tried
to
find
it
without
success
presently
a
stupid
old
countryman
came
up
leading
the
horse
when
asked
how
he
found
it
he
only
drawled
out
i
jest
considered
a
spell
i
thought
ef
i
was
a
horse
whar
would
i
go
and
i
went
there
and
he
had
that
a
good
deal
the
way
hepworth
did
they
all
laughed
at
kenneth
funny
story
but
patty
said
it
was
a
sort
of
intuition
but
all
the
same
i
object
to
having
hepworth
compared
to
a
stupid
old
countryman
i
do
care
what
i
compared
to
said
hepworth
gaily
as
long
as
we
found
you
two
runaways
and
if
we
can
get
you
back
in
time
for
the
opening
of
the
fair
the
time
was
very
short
indeed
and
as
soon
as
they
landed
at
the
dock
patty
and
bertha
started
for
the
house
to
don
their
costumes
as
quickly
as
possible
the
fair
or
bazaar
of
all
nations
as
it
was
called
was
really
arranged
on
an
elaborate
scale
it
was
held
on
the
spacious
grounds
of
ashton
one
of
the
wealthiest
of
the
summer
residents
of
sandy
cove
so
many
people
had
interested
themselves
in
the
charity
and
so
much
enthusiasm
had
they
put
into
their
work
that
when
it
was
time
to
throw
the
gates
open
to
the
public
it
was
a
festive
and
gorgeous
scene
indeed
the
idea
of
representing
various
nations
had
been
picturesquely
if
not
always
logically
carried
out
a
japanese
had
been
built
with
some
regard
to
japanese
fashion
but
with
even
more
effort
at
comfort
and
attractive
colour
effects
the
young
ladies
who
attended
it
wore
most
becoming
japanese
costumes
and
with
slanting
pencilled
eyebrows
and
japanese
headdresses
they
served

italy

was
a
beautiful
pergola
which
had
been
built
for
the
occasion
but
which
ashton
intended
to
keep
as
a
permanent
decoration
over
the
structure
were
beautiful
vines
and
climbing
plants
and
inside
was
a
gorgeous
collection
of
blossoms
of
every
sort
italian
girls
in
costumes
and
a
profuse
array
of
jewelry
sold
bouquets

growing

were
assisted
in
their
enterprise
by
swarthy

spain

a

hepworth
had
charge
of
this
and
it
truly
did
credit
to
his
artistic
ability
built
on
the
side
of
a
hill
it
was
a
clever
imitation
of
a
spanish
vineyard
and
large
grape
vines
had
been
uprooted
and
transplanted
to
complete
the
effect
to
be
sure
the
bunches
of
grapes
were
of
the
hothouse
variety
and
were
tied
on
the
vines
but
they
sold
well
as
did
also
the
other
luscious
fruits
that
were
offered
for
sale
in

at

one
of

jolliest
of

the
french

with

instinct
had
a
millinery
booth
here
were
sold
lovely
feminine
bits
of
apparel
including
collars
belts
laces
and
handkerchiefs
but
principally
hats
the
hats
were
truly
beautiful
creations
and
though
made
of
simple
materials
light
straw
muslin
and
even
of
paper
they
were
all
dainty
confections
that
any
summer
girl
might
be
glad
to
wear
the
little
french
ladies
who
exhibited
these
goods
were
voluble
and
dramatic
and
in
true
french
fashion
and
with
more
or
less
true
french
language
they
extolled
the
beauty
of
their
wares
in
a
swiss
châlet
the
peasants
sold
dolls
and
toys
in
a
cuban
construction
of
which
no
one
knew
the
exact
title
some
native
men
sold
cigars
and
in
a
strange
kind
of
a
hut
which
purported
to
be
an
eskimo
dwelling
ice
cream
could
be
bought
the

waved
over
a
handsome
fountain
as
the
authorities
had
decided
that
soda
was
the
most
typical
american
refreshment
they
could
offer
to
their
patrons
but
an
indian
encampment
also
claimed
american
protection
and
a
group
of
western
cowboys
took
pride
in
their
ranch
and
even
more
pride
in
their
swaggering
costumes
altogether
the
bazaar
was
a
great
show
and
as
it
was
to
last
for
three
days
nobody
expected
to
exhaust
all
its
entertainments
in
one
visit
the
romany
rest
was
one
of
the
prettiest
conceits
and
though
an
idealised
gypsy
encampment
it
proved
a
very
popular
attraction
half
a
dozen
girls
and
as
many
young
men
wore
what
they
fondly
hoped
looked
enough
like
gypsy
costumes
to
justify
the
name
but
at
any
rate
they
were
most
becoming
and
beautiful
to
look
upon
patty
was
the
gypsy
queen
and
looked
like
that
personage
as
represented
in
comic
opera
seated
on
a
queerly
constructed
and
somewhat
wobbly
throne
she
told
fortunes
to
those
who
desired
to
know
what
the
future
held
for
them
apparently
there
was
great
curiosity
in
this
respect
for
patty
was
kept
steadily
busy
from
the
time
she
arrived
at
her
place
other
gypsies
sold
gaily
coloured
beads
amulets
and
charms
and
others
stirred
a
brew
in
a
gypsy
kettle
over
a
real
fire
and
sold
cupfuls
of
it
to
those
who
wished
in
this
way
to
tempt
fate
still
further
it
was
a
perfect
day
and
the
afternoon
was
progressing
most
satisfactorily
bertha
was
one
of
the
swiss
peasants
and
by
dint
of
much
hurrying
she
and
patty
had
been
able
to
get
ready
in
time
to
join
the
parade
of
costumed
attendants
as
they
marched
to
their
various
stations
though
had
it
not
been
for
phelps
and
his
swift
they
could
scarcely
have
reached
the
fair
grounds
in
time
elise
was
one
of
the
italian
flower
girls
and
kenneth
also
wore
the
garb
of
italy
hepworth
and
roger
farrington
were
indians
and
brandished
their
tomahawks
and
tossed
their
feathered
heads
in
fearsome
fashion
dick
phelps
was
a
cowboy
and
his
herculean
frame
well
suited
the
picturesque
western
dress
and
charlie
roland
flattered
himself
that
arrayed
as
a
chinaman
he
was
too
funny
for
anything
although
patty
had
become
better
acquainted
with
young
roland
she
had
not
learned
to
like
him
his
conceited
ways
and
pompous
manner
seemed
to
her
silly
and
artificial
beside
the
frank
comradeship
of
her
other
friends
he
came
early
to
have
his
fortune
told
by
the
gypsy
queen
and
though
of
course
patty
was
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
way
in
which
the
cards
fell
and
though
she
told
the
fortunes
strictly
according
to
the
instructions
in
a
printed
book
which
she
had
learned
by
heart
she
was
not
especially
sorry
when
roland
fortune
proved
to
be
not
altogether
a
desirable
one
but
the
young
man
was
in
nowise
disconcerted
it
does
matter
he
said
cheerfully
i
had
my
fortune
told
lots
of
times
and
things
always
happen
just
contrary
to
what
is
predicted
but
i
say
miss
romany
ca
you
leave
your
post
for
a
few
minutes
and
go
with
me
to
the
japanese
tea
place
for
a
cup
of
their
refreshing
beverage
thank
you
ever
so
much
said
patty
but
i
really
ca
leave
here
there
a
whole
string
of
people
waiting
for
their
fortunes
and
i
must
stand
by
my
post
perhaps
i
can
go
later
she
added
for
though
she
did
not
care
for
charlie
roland
attentions
she
was
too
to
wish
to
hurt
his
feelings
i
consider
that
a
promise
said
roland
as
he
moved
away
to
make
place
for
the
next
seeker
after
knowledge
patty
turned
to
her
work
and
thought
no
more
of
charlie
roland
and
his
undesirable
invitation
soon
kenneth
came
to
have
his
fortune
told
for
it
had
been
arranged
that
each
booth
should
have
plenty
of
attendants
in
order
that
they
might
take
turns
in
leaving
their
posts
and
promenading
about
the
grounds
this
was
supposed
to
advertise
their
own
particular
nation
besides
giving
all
a
chance
to
see
the
sights
kenneth
fortune
proved
to
be
a
bright
and
happy
one
but
he
was
not
unduly
elated
over
it
for
his
faith
in
such
things
was
not
implicit
thank
you
he
said
gravely
as
patty
finished
telling
of
the
glories
which
would
attend
his
future
career
i
do
think
there
anything
omitted
from
that
string
of
good
luck
unless
it
being
president
and
i
not
quite
sure
i
want
to
be
that
yes
you
do
said
patty
every
good
american
ought
to
want
that
if
only
as
a
matter
of
patriotism
well
i
patriotic
enough
said
kenneth
and
i
want
it
if
you
want
me
to
want
it
and
now
patty
you
worked
here
long
enough
for
the
present
let
somebody
else
take
your
place
and
you
come
with
me
for
a
walk
about
the
grounds
i
take
you
to
the
pergola
and
we
buy
some
flowers
from
elise
i
love
to
go
ken
but
truly
i
ought
to
stay
here
a
while
longer
lots
of
people
want
their
fortune
told
and
nobody
can
do
it
but
me
because
i
learnt
all
that
lingo
out
of
a
book
no
i
ca
go
now
run
along
busy
patty
spoke
more
shortly
than
she
meant
to
for
the
very
reason
that
she
wanted
to
go
with
kenneth
but
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
remain
at
her
post
kenneth
appreciated
the
principle
of
the
thing
but
he
thought
that
patty
might
have
been
a
little
kinder
about
it
his
own
temper
was
a
little
stirred
by
the
incident
and
rising
quickly
he
said
all
right
stay
here
then
and
turning
on
his
heel
he
sauntered
carelessly
away
patty
looked
after
him
thinking
what
a
handsome
boy
he
was
and
how
well
his
italian
suit
became
him
kenneth
skin
was
naturally
rather
dark
and
his
black
eyes
and
hair
and
heavy
eyebrows
were
somewhat
of
the
italian
type
his
white
linen
blouse
was
slightly
turned
in
at
the
throat
and
he
wore
a
crimson
silk
tie
and
sash
to
match
knotted
at
one
side
a
hat
of
soft
grey
felt
sat
jauntily
on
his
head
and
as
he
swung
himself
down
the
path
patty
thought
she
had
never
seen
him
look
so
well
soon
after
this
charlie
roland
came
back
again
i
brought
someone
to
help
you
out
he
said
as
he
introduced
a
young
girl
who
accompanied
him
this
is
miss
leslie
and
she
knows
fortune
telling
from
the
ground
up
give
her
a
red
sash
and
a
bandana
handkerchief
to
tie
around
her
head
and
let
her
take
your
place
if
only
for
a
short
time
and
you
come
with
me
to
buy
some
flowers
do
you
know
your
costume
really
calls
for
some
scarlet
blossoms
in
your
hair
and
over
in
the
pergola
they
have
some
red
geraniums
that
are
simply
great
come
on
let
get
some
patty
did
want
some
red
flowers
and
had
meant
to
have
some
but
she
dressed
in
such
a
hurry
that
there
was
no
time
to
find
any
moreover
she
had
never
known
charlie
roland
to
appear
to
such
good
advantage
he
seemed
to
have
dropped
his
pompous
manner
with
his
civilised
dress
and
in
his
comical
chinaman
costume
he
seemed
far
more
attractive
than
in
his
own
everyday
dress
and
since
he
had
provided
her
with
a
substitute
patty
saw
no
reason
for
refusing
his
invitation
so
together
they
left
the
romany
rest
and
walked
about
the
fair
chatting
with
people
here
and
there
until
they
reached
the
pergola
elise
was
delighted
to
see
them
and
while
the
italian
girls
besought
roland
to
buy
their
flowers
the
italian
young
men
clustered
around
patty
and
with
merry
laugh
and
jest
presented
her
with
sundry
floral
offerings
there
was
one
exception
however
kenneth
stood
aloof
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
that
patty
had
intentionally
slighted
him
he
had
asked
her
to
come
to
the
pergola
for
flowers
and
she
had
refused
then
a
few
minutes
later
she
had
accepted
a
similar
invitation
from
that
stupid
young
roland
kenneth
was
obliged
to
admit
to
himself
that
young
roland
did
not
look
stupid
just
at
present
for
he
had
some
talent
as
a
comedian
and
was
acting
the
part
of
a
funny
chinaman
with
success
but
that
did
make
any
difference
to
kenneth
and
he
looked
reproachfully
at
patty
as
she
accepted
the
flowers
and
gay
compliments
from
her
attendant
cavalier
patty
had
intended
to
explain
to
kenneth
why
it
had
been
possible
for
her
to
leave
the
gypsy
camp
in
charge
of
another
fortune
teller
but
when
she
saw
the
boy
moody
expression
and
sulky
attitude
her
sense
of
humour
was
touched
and
she
giggled
to
herself
at
the
idea
of
kenneth
being
angry
at
such
a
trifle
she
thought
it
distinctly
silly
of
him
and
being
in
a
mischievous
mood
she
concluded
he
ought
to
be
punished
for
such
foolishness
so
instead
of
smiling
at
him
she
gave
him
only
a
careless
glance
and
then
devoted
her
attention
to
the
others
patty
was
a
general
favourite
and
her
happy
sunny
ways
made
friends
for
her
wherever
she
went
she
was
therefore
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
merry
young
people
some
of
whom
had
just
been
introduced
to
her
and
others
whom
she
had
known
longer
and
as
she
laughed
and
chatted
with
them
kenneth
began
to
think
that
he
was
acting
rather
foolishly
and
longed
to
join
the
group
around
the
gypsy
queen
but
the
boy
was
both
sensitive
and
proud
and
he
could
not
quite
bring
himself
to
overlook
what
he
considered
an
intentional
unkindness
on
the
part
of
patty
so
wandering
away
from
the
pergola
he
visited
other
booths
and
chatted
with
other
groups
determined
to
ignore
patty
and
her
perversities
patty
not
being
an
obtuse
young
person
saw
through
all
this
and
chose
to
be
amused
by
it
dear
old
ken
she
thought
to
herself
what
a
goose
he
is
i
get
nan
to
ask
him
to
have
supper
with
us
all
in
the
english
dairy
and
then
i
expect
he
thaw
out
that
frozen
manner
of
his
feeling
that
she
ought
to
return
to
her
own
post
patty
told
her
chinaman
so
and
together
they
went
back
to
the
romany
rest
but
as
patty
was
about
to
take
her
place
again
at
the
fortune
teller
table
phelps
came
along
and
desired
her
to
go
with
him
and
have
her
photograph
taken
at
first
patty
demurred
though
she
greatly
wanted
to
go
but
miss
leslie
said
she
was
not
at
all
tired
of
fortune
telling
and
would
gladly
continue
to
substitute
for
patty
a
while
longer
come
on
then
said
dick
phelps
there
no
reason
why
you
should
since
miss
leslie
is
kind
enough
to
fill
your
place
patty
still
hesitated
for
she
thought
that
kenneth
would
be
still
more
offended
if
he
saw
her
walking
around
with
phelps
after
having
told
him
that
she
could
not
leave
the
gypsy
camp
but
dick
phelps
was
of
an
imperious
nature
he
was
accustomed
to
having
his
own
way
and
was
impatient
at
patty
hesitation
come
on
he
said
march
and
taking
her
by
the
arm
he
led
her
swiftly
down
the
path
toward
the
photograph
booth
as
he
strode
along
cowboy
fashion
patty
said
meekly
let
go
of
my
arm
please
phelps
i
think
you
broken
two
bones
already
and
walk
so
fast
i
all
out
of
breath
forgive
me
said
dick
phelps
suddenly
checking
his
speed
and
smiling
down
at
the
girl
beside
him
you
see
this
cowboy
rig
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
were
back
on
the
plains
again
and
i
ca
seem
to
adjust
myself
to
civilised
conditions
phelps
looked
very
splendid
as
a
cowboy
and
patty
listened
with
interest
as
he
told
her
of
an
exciting
episode
which
had
occurred
during
his
ranch
life
in
a
distant
western
territory
so
engrossed
did
they
become
in
this
conversation
that
the
photographs
were
forgotten
for
the
moment
and
they
strolled
along
past
the
various
booths
unheeding
the
numerous
invitations
to
enter
of
course
kenneth
saw
them
and
from
a
trifling
offence
patty
conduct
seemed
to
him
to
have
grown
into
a
purposed
rudeness
as
they
passed
him
patty
smiled
pleasantly
and
paused
saying
all
going
to
have
supper
in
the
dairy
and
of
course
you
be
with
us
ken
of
course
i
wo
said
kenneth
and
deliberately
turning
on
his
heel
he
walked
the
other
way
chapter
xxiii
the
end
of
the
summer
whew
said
dick
phelps
in
his
straightforward
way
he
mad
at
you
is
he
yes
said
patty
and
it
so
silly
all
about
nothing
at
all
i
wish
you
take
me
back
to
him
phelps
and
leave
us
alone
and
i
think
i
can
straighten
matters
out
in
two
minutes
indeed
i
do
nothing
of
the
sort
returned
phelps
in
his
masterful
way
you
promised
to
go
to
the
photograph
place
and
where
we
going
i
do
propose
to
give
you
up
to
any
young
man
we
chance
to
meet
patty
laughed
and
they
went
on
at
the
photograph
booth
they
found
many
of
the
gaily
dressed
young
people
anxious
to
have
pictures
of
themselves
in
their
pretty
costumes
patty
and
phelps
had
to
wait
their
turn
but
finally
succeeded
in
getting
a
number
of
pictures
patty
had
some
taken
alone
and
some
in
which
she
was
one
of
a
gay
group
some
were
successful
portraits
and
others
were
not
but
all
were
provocative
of
much
laughter
and
fun
by
a
rapid
process
of
development
the
photographers
were
enabled
to
furnish
the
completed
pictures
in
less
than
a
half
hour
after
the
cameras
did
their
work
and
as
a
consequence
this
booth
was
exceedingly
popular
and
promised
handsome
returns
for
the
benefit
of
charity
phelps
and
patty
loitered
about
waiting
for
their
pictures
when
patty
caught
sight
of
nan
and
running
to
her
she
said
for
sake
nan
do
help
me
out
kenneth
as
mad
as
hops
and
all
about
nothing
now
i
want
you
to
ask
him
to
come
to
supper
with
our
crowd
and
you
must
him
come
i
ca
make
him
come
if
he
does
want
to
you
been
teasing
him
patty
and
you
must
get
out
of
your
own
scrapes
ah
nan
dear
coaxed
patty
do
be
good
and
truly
if
you
just
persuade
him
to
come
to
supper
with
us
i
do
the
rest
i
try
said
nan
as
she
walked
away
but
i
wo
promise
that
succeed
she
did
succeed
however
and
some
time
later
fairfield
gathered
the
large
party
whom
he
had
invited
to
supper
in
the
english
dairy
the
supper
was
to
be
a
fine
one
far
exceeding
the
bounds
of
dairy
fare
and
fairfield
had
reserved
a
long
table
for
his
guests
as
they
trooped
in
laughing
and
talking
and
seated
themselves
for
the
feast
patty
was
relieved
to
see
that
kenneth
was
among
them
after
all
he
took
a
seat
between
elise
and
helen
barlow
and
knowing
bumble
good
nature
patty
went
directly
to
her
and
asked
her
if
she
would
move
as
she
wanted
to
sit
there
herself
of
course
i
will
said
bumble
and
jumping
up
she
ran
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
then
patty
deliberately
sat
down
by
kenneth
who
could
very
well
get
up
and
walk
away
himself
though
he
looked
at
her
with
no
expression
of
welcome
in
his
glance
without
a
word
patty
leaned
over
and
selected
from
a
dish
of
olives
on
the
table
one
which
had
a
stem
to
it
with
a
tiny
bit
of
ribbon
she
tied
the
olive
to
a
little
green
branch
she
had
brought
in
with
her
and
then
demurely
held
the
token
toward
kenneth
for
a
moment
the
boy
looked
rather
blank
and
then
realising
that
patty
was
offering
him
the
olive
branch
of
peace
and
that
she
had
gone
to
some
trouble
to
do
this
and
that
moreover
she
had
done
it
rather
cleverly
the
boy
face
broke
into
a
smile
and
he
turned
toward
patty
thank
you
he
said
as
he
took
the
little
spray
and
attached
it
to
the
rolling
collar
of
his
blouse
i
accept
it
with
its
full
meaning
you
such
a
goose
kenneth
said
patty
her
eyes
dancing
with
laughter
there
was
nothing
to
get
huffy
about
well
said
kenneth
feeling
his
grounds
for
complaint
slipping
away
from
him
you
pranced
off
with
that
roland
chap
after
you
had
just
told
me
you
could
leave
your
gypsy
queen
business
i
know
it
said
patty
but
ken
he
brought
a
nice
lady
to
fill
my
place
and
besides
he
asked
me
to
go
to
get
red
flowers
and
i
really
wanted
red
flowers
i
asked
you
to
go
for
flowers
too
said
kenneth
not
yet
entirely
mollified
yes
said
patty
but
you
did
say
flowers
how
did
i
know
but
that
you
buy
pink
or
blue
ones
and
so
spoil
my
whole
gypsy
costume
kenneth
had
to
laugh
in
spite
of
himself
at
this
bit
of
audacity
and
then
right
afterwards
you
went
off
again
with
dick
phelps
he
continued
kenneth
said
patty
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
mock
terror
i
could
help
myself
that
time
honest
i
could
phelps
is
a
fearful
tyrant
he
an
ogre
and
when
he
commanded
me
to
go
i
just
had
to
go
he
a
man
that
makes
you
do
a
thing
whether
you
want
to
or
not
why
kenneth
he
just
marched
me
off
all
right
said
kenneth
i
take
a
leaf
out
of
his
book
after
this
when
i
want
you
to
go
anywhere
just
march
you
off
you
can
try
said
patty
saucily
but
i
not
sure
you
can
do
it
it
takes
a
certain
type
of
man
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
successfully
and
i
do
know
anybody
but
dick
phelps
who
just
that
kind
but
peace
was
restored
for
kenneth
realised
that
patty
explanation
was
a
fair
one
and
that
he
had
been
foolishly
quick
to
take
offence
after
supper
they
all
went
to
the
grand
stand
to
see
the
parade
of
fancy
costumes
these
were
quite
separate
from
the
booth
attendants
and
a
prize
had
been
offered
for
the
cleverest
conceit
most
successfully
carried
out
when
at
last
the
grand
march
took
place
it
showed
a
wonderful
array
of
thoroughly
ingenious
costumes
of
course
there
were
many
clowns
historical
characters
fairies
and
queer
nondescript
creatures
but
there
were
also
many
characters
which
were
unique
and
noteworthy
hepworth
who
was
in
the
parade
had
chosen
to
represent
the
full
moon
how
he
did
it
no
one
quite
knew
but
all
that
was
visible
was
an
enormous
sphere
of
translucent
brightness
and
a
luminous
yellow
color
fairfield
declared
that
the
medium
must
be
phosphorus
but
all
agreed
that
it
was
a
wonderful
achievement
and
many
thought
it
would
surely
take
the
prize
the
sphere
was
hollow
and
made
of
a
light
framework
and
hepworth
walked
inside
of
it
really
carrying
it
along
with
him
it
so
nearly
touched
the
ground
that
his
feet
were
scarcely
observable
and
the
great
six
foot
globe
made
a
decided
sensation
as
it
moved
slowly
along
patty
remembered
that
roger
had
declared
he
was
going
to
take
the
prize
and
as
she
had
knowledge
of
the
boy
ability
along
these
lines
she
felt
by
no
means
sure
that
it
would
eclipse
hepworth
shining
orb
and
sure
enough
when
roger
appeared
it
was
in
the
character
of
a
christmas
tree
the
clever
youth
had
selected
just
the
right
kind
of
a
tree
and
cutting
away
enough
twigs
and
branches
near
the
trunk
on
one
side
he
had
made
a
space
in
which
he
could
thrust
the
whole
of
his
tall
slender
self
to
protect
his
face
and
hands
from
the
scratchy
foliage
and
also
to
render
himself
inconspicuous
he
wore
a
robe
of
dark
brown
muslin
which
concealed
even
his
face
and
arms
though
eyeholes
allowed
him
to
see
where
he
was
going
in
a
word
the
boy
himself
almost
constituted
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
by
walking
slowly
it
looked
as
if
the
tree
itself
was
moving
along
without
assistance
the
tree
was
gaily
hung
with
real
christmas
trinkets
and
decorations
and
lighted
with
candles
the
idea
was
wonderfully
clever
and
though
it
had
been
hard
work
to
arrange
the
boughs
to
conceal
him
entirely
roger
had
accomplished
it
and
the
gay
decorations
hid
all
defects
the
judges
awarded
the
prize
to
roger
who
calmly
remarked
to
patty
afterward
i
told
you
i
get
it
did
i
yes
said
patty
and
so
then
of
course
i
knew
you
would
it
was
a
rather
tired
party
that
went
back
to
the
fairfields
house
at
the
close
of
the
evening
nan
and
fairfield
issued
strict
orders
that
everybody
must
go
to
bed
at
once
as
there
were
two
more
strenuous
days
ahead
and
they
needed
all
the
rest
they
could
get
but
next
morning
they
reappeared
quite
ready
for
fresh
exertions
and
patty
declared
that
for
her
part
she
like
to
be
a
gypsy
all
the
year
round
well
i
never
want
to
be
a
christmas
tree
again
said
roger
in
spite
of
my
precautions
i
all
scratched
up
never
mind
said
his
sister
consolingly
you
took
the
prize
and
that
glory
enough
to
make
up
for
lots
of
scratches
the
second
and
third
days
of
the
fair
were
much
like
the
first
except
that
the
crowds
of
visitors
continually
increased
the
fame
of
the
entertainment
spread
rapidly
and
people
came
even
from
distant
parts
of
long
island
to
attend
the
festivities
but
at
last
it
was
all
over
and
the
fairfield
verandah
was
crowded
with
young
people
apparently
of
all
nations
who
were
congratulating
each
other
on
the
wonderful
success
of
course
said
patty
the
greatest
thing
was
that
we
had
such
perfect
weather
if
it
had
rained
the
whole
thing
would
have
been
spoiled
but
it
did
rain
said
nan
and
everything
went
off
all
right
and
they
must
have
made
bushels
of
money
well
it
was
lovely
said
patty
with
a
little
sigh
and
i
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
but
i
do
want
to
engage
in
another
one
right
away
i
think
i
shall
go
to
bed
and
sleep
for
a
week
i
wish
i
were
a
bear
said
kenneth
they
can
go
to
sleep
and
sleep
all
winter
you
make
a
good
bear
said
patty
in
an
aside
to
him
because
you
can
be
so
cross
but
the
merry
smile
that
accompanied
her
words
robbed
them
of
any
unpleasant
intent
and
kenneth
smiled
back
in
sympathy
just
to
think
said
nan
a
week
from
we
all
be
back
in
the
city
and
our
lovely
summer
vacation
a
thing
of
the
past
it
has
been
a
beautiful
summer
said
patty
her
thoughts
flying
backward
over
the
past
season
i
never
had
such
a
happy
summer
in
my
life
it
been
just
one
round
of
pleasure
after
another
everybody
has
been
so
good
to
me
and
the
whole
world
seems
to
have
connived
to
help
me
have
a
good
time
in
so
far
as
i
part
of
the
whole
world
allow
me
to
express
my
willingness
to
keep
right
on
conniving
said
big
dick
phelps
in
his
funny
way
me
too
said
kenneth
in
his
hearty
boyish
voice
hepworth
said
nothing
but
he
smiled
at
patty
from
where
he
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
verandah
