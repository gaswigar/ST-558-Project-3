at
various
times
during
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
crossed
the
atlantic
two
protestant
irishmen
a
lowland
scotsman
and
an
englishman
and
thereby
they
fixed
the
character
of
mr
henry
genius
for
the
essential
thing
about
mr
james
was
that
he
was
an
american
and
that
meant
for
his
type
and
generation
that
he
could
never
feel
at
home
until
he
was
in
exile
he
came
of
a
stock
that
was
the
product
of
culture
and
needed
it
as
part
of
its
environment
but
at
the
time
of
his
childhood
and
youth
he
was
born
in
culture
was
a
thing
that
was
but
budding
here
and
there
in
america
in
such
corners
as
were
not
being
used
in
the
business
of
establishing
the
material
civilisation
of
the
new
country
the
social
life
of
old
new
york
and
boston
had
its
delicacy
its
homespun
honesty
of
texture
its
austerer
sort
of
beauty
but
plainly
the
american
people
were
too
preoccupied
by
their
businesses
and
professions
to
devote
their
money
to
the
embellishment
of
or
their
intelligence
to
the
development
of
manners
hawthorne
and
emerson
and
margaret
fuller
and
their
friends
were
trying
to
make
a
culture
against
time
but
any
record
of
their
lives
which
gives
a
candid
account
of
how
desperately
these
people
had
to
struggle
to
make
the
meanest
living
shows
that
the
poor
american
ants
were
then
utterly
unable
to
form
the
leisured
community
which
is
the
necessary
environment
for
grasshoppers
the
impression
of
personal
history
is
condensed
into
the
single
word
concord
wrote
mr
james
later
and
all
the
condensation
in
the
world
will
not
make
it
rich
there
was
no
blinking
the
fact
that
in
attempting
to
set
up
in
this
unfinished
country
art
was
like
a
delicate
lady
who
moves
into
a
house
before
the
plaster
is
dried
on
the
walls
she
was
bound
to
lead
an
invalid
existence
this
incapacity
of
america
to
supply
the
colour
of
life
became
obvious
to
henry
and
william
james
the
two
charming
little
boys
in
tight
trousers
and
jackets
one
of
whom
grew
up
to
write
fiction
as
though
it
were
philosophy
and
the
other
to
write
philosophy
as
though
it
were
fiction
at
a
very
early
age
it
did
not
escape
their
infant
observation
that
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
fascinated
them
by
dancing
on
the
at
barnum
museum
always
bore
exotic
names
and
when
they
grew
older
and
developed
the
youthful
taste
for
anecdotic
art
they
found
it
could
be
gratified
only
by
such
european
importations
as
thorwaldsen
and
his
the
great
white
images
of
which
were
ranged
round
the
maroon
walls
of
the
new
york
crystal
palace
or
benjamin
haydon
pictures
in
the
düsseldorf
collection
in
broadway
and
when
they
grew
older
still
and
began
to
show
a
fine
talent
for
painting
and
drawing
their
unfolding
artistic
sense
found
more
and
more
intimations
of
the
wonder
of
europe
view
of
that
hung
in
the
jameses
home
was
pronounced
by
a
friend
who
had
lived
much
in
italy
not
to
be
of
tuscany
at
all
colours
in
tuscany
were
softer
but
such
brightness
might
be
found
in
other
parts
of
italy
so
europe
was
as
various
as
that
a
place
of
innumerable
changing
glories
like
a
sunrise
but
better
than
a
sunrise
inasmuch
as
every
glory
was
encrusted
with
the
richness
of
legend
but
most
powerful
of
all
influences
that
made
the
jameses
rebel
against
the
narrowness
of
broadway
and
the
provincial
spareness
of
the
old
new
york
which
must
have
been
something
like
a
neat
virgin
bloomsbury
was
their
father
the
reverend
henry
james
was
wasted
on
young
america
it
had
developed
neither
the
creative
stream
that
would
have
inspired
him
nor
the
intellectual
follies
that
he
could
slay
with
that
beautiful
wit
which
made
him
one
of
the
great
of
the
world
carlyle
is
the
same
old
sausage
fizzing
and
sputtering
in
his
own
grease
only
infinitely
unreconciled
to
the
blest
providence
which
guides
human
affairs
he
names
god
frequently
and
alludes
to
the
highest
things
as
if
they
were
realities
but
all
only
as
for
a
picturesque
effect
so
completely
does
he
seem
to
regard
them
as
habitually
circumvented
and
set
at
naught
by
the
politicians
the
man
who
could
write
that
should
have
been
a
strong
and
salutary
influence
on
english
culture
and
he
knew
it
it
is
probable
that
when
he
and
his
wife
paid
what
mr
james
tells
us
was
their
first
that
is
our
mother
first
visit
to
europe
which
had
quite
immediately
followed
my
birth
which
appears
to
have
lasted
some
year
and
a
half
the
last
clause
of
this
sentence
is
unfortunate
for
a
novelist
famous
for
his
deliberation
he
brought
his
babies
with
him
with
a
solemnity
of
intention
as
if
to
dip
them
in
a
holy
well
thus
it
was
that
the
little
jameses
not
only
bore
themselves
proudly
through
their
childhood
as
became
those
who
had
lived
as
babies
in
piccadilly
and
read
with
a
proprietary
instinct
but
were
also
possessed
in
spirit
by
something
that
was
more
than
the
discontent
with
the
flatness
of
daily
life
and
the
desire
for
a
brighter
scene
that
comes
to
the
ordinary
child
from
their
father
preoccupation
they
gained
a
rationalised
consciousness
that
america
was
an
incomplete
environment
that
in
europe
there
were
many
mines
of
treasure
which
they
must
find
and
rifle
if
they
hoped
for
the
health
of
their
minds
and
the
salvation
of
their
souls
in
when
henry
james
was
twelve
the
family
yielded
to
its
passion
and
crossed
the
atlantic
the
following
four
years
were
of
immense
importance
to
mr
james
and
consequently
to
ourselves
for
he
had
been
born
with
a
mind
that
received
impressions
as
if
they
had
been
embraces
and
remembered
them
with
as
fierce
a
leaping
of
the
blood
just
as
his
brother
william
mind
acquired
and
created
systems
of
thought
as
joyously
as
other
men
like
meeting
friends
and
establishing
a
family
he
found
london
in
the
main
jolly
rather
ugly
but
comfortable
and
full
of
character
just
as
he
had
seen
it
in
but
here
and
there
detected
notably
on
a
drive
from
london

london
it
was
a
soft
june
evening
with
a
lingering
light
and
swarming
crowds
as
they
then
seemed
to
me
of
figures
reminding
me
of
george
cruikshank
artful
dodger
and
his
bill
sykes
and
his
nancy

with
the
bigger
brutality
of
life
which
pressed

the
early
victorian
as
we
jogged
over
the
bridge
and
cropped
up
in
more
and
more
patches
for
all
our
course
culminating
somewhere
far
to
the
west
in
the
vivid
picture
framed
by
the
cab
window
of
a
woman
reeling
backward
as
a
man
felled
her
to
the
ground
with
a
blow

being
formed
by
the

flourish
of

haussmann
into
its
present
splendours
of
wide
regularity
yet
still
homely
with
remnants
of
the
dusty
ruralism
of
its
state
he
saw
all
the
pretty
show
of
the
second

he
stood
in
the

watched
the
baby
prince

st

with
his
escort
of
blue
and
silver
and
the

the

its
floors
gleaming
with
polished
wood
its
walls
glowing
with
masterpieces
and
its
proportions
awesomely
interminable
and
soaring
was
the
scene
of
his
young
imaginative
life
those
were
the
great
places
but
there
were
also
geneva
and
boulogne
and
zurich
and
bonn
the
differences
of
which
he
savoured
and
above
all
the
richness
of
desultory
contact
with

school

and
a
boy
called
coquelin

tutored
by
robert
thompson
the
famous
edinburgh
teacher
who
was
afterwards
to
instruct
robert
louis
stevenson
and
many
other
eminent
scots
in
jacobite
sympathies
as
well
as
the
more
usual
subjects
and
by
lerambert
whose
verse
had
been
praised
by
in
his
impressions
writes
mr
james
of
this
period
were
not
merely
all
right
but
were
the
dearest
things
in
the
world
and
one
must
remember
that
not
only
were
impressions
much
to
young
henry
james
they
were
all
he
had
his
mental
life
consisted
of
nothing
else
his
natural
inaptitude
for
acquiring
systematised
knowledge
was
probably
intensified
by
the
study
of
foreign
languages
entailed
by
this
travel
for
if
a
child
spends
its
time
learning
several
systems
of
naming
things
it
plainly
has
less
energy
to
spare
for
learning
systems
of
arranging
things
at
any
rate
his
inability
to
grasp
the
elements
of
arithmetic
and
mathematics
led
to
his
removal
from
the
polytechnic
school
at
zurich
and
was
the
cause
of
despair
in
all
his
tutors
but
most
minds
however
incapable
they
may
be
of
following
the
exact
sciences
or
speculative
thought
have
some
sort
of
idea
of
the
system
of
the
universe
inserted
into
them
by
early
instruction
in
one
or
other
of
the
religious
faiths
this
unifying
influence
was
refused
to
henry
james
by
the
circumstance
that
his
father
had
found
certain
religious
doubts
that
had
almost
driven
him
from
the
ministry
solved
in
the
works
of
swedenborg
which
he
found
not
at
all
incredible
but
as
he
once
said
in
a
phrase
that
showed
him
his
son
own
father
fairly
insipid
with
veracity
on
this
foundation
of
swedenborgianism
he
had
built
up
for
himself
a
religion
which
was
nothing
if
not
a
philosophy
extraordinarily
complex
and
worked
out
and
original
intensely
personal
as
an
exposition
yet
not
only
susceptible
of
application
but
clamorous
for
it
to
the
whole
field
of
consciousness
nature
and
society
history
knowledge
all
human
relations
and
questions
every
pulse
of
the
process
of
our
destiny
this
was
no
playground
for
the
young
intelligence
so
young
henry
james
was
told
to
prepare
himself
by
drinking
from
such
springs
as
seemed
to
him
refreshing
when
he
was
asked
to
what
church
he
went
he
was
bidden
by
his
father
to
reply
that
we
could
plead
nothing
less
than
the
whole
privilege
of
christendom
and
that
there
was
no
communion
even
that
of
the
catholics
even
that
of
the
jews
even
that
of
the
swedenborgians
from
which
we
need
find
ourselves
excluded
he
certainly
liked
to
exercise
this
privilege
but
he
admits
that
my
grounds
may
have
been
but
the
love
of
the
in
general
thanks
to
which
figures
faces
furniture
sounds
smells
and
colours
became
for
me
wherever
enjoyed
and
enjoyed
most
where
most
collected
a
positive
little
orgy
of
the
senses
and
riot
of
the
mind
which
was
to
be
expected
as
also
was
the
fact
that
he
never
broke
his
childish
habit
of
regarding
his
father
religion
as
a
closed
temple
standing
in
the
centre
of
his
family
life
the
general
holiness
of
which
he
took
for
granted
so
thoroughly
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
investigate
its
particulars
this
european
visit
came
to
an
end
in
and
william
and
henry
james
spent
the
next
year
or
so
at
newport
studying
art
under
the
direction
of
their
friend
john
la
farge
with
the
result
that
william
painted
extremely
well
in
the
style
of
manet
and
henry
showed
as
little
ability
in
this
direction
as
he
had
shown
in
any
other
in
the
civil
war
broke
out
and
had
it
not
been
for
an
accident
the
whole
character
of
mr
james
genius
would
have
been
altered
if
he
had
seen
america
by
the
light
of
bursting
shells
and
flaming
forest
he
might
never
have
taken
his
eyes
off
her
again
he
might
have
watched
her
fascinated
through
all
the
changes
of
tone
and
organisation
which
began
at
the
close
of
the
war
he
might
have
been
the
great
american
novelist
in
subject
as
well
as
origin
but
it
happened
in
that
soft
spring
when
he
and
every
other
young
man
of
the
north
realised
that
there
was
a
crisis
at
hand
in
which
their
honour
was
concerned
and
they
must
answer
lincoln
appeal
for
recruits
that
he
was
one
day
called
to
help
in
putting
out
a
fire
in
working
the
he
sustained
an
injury
so
serious
that
he
could
never
hope
to
share
the
northern
glory
that
there
were
before
him
years
of
continuous
pain
and
weakness
that
ultimately
he
formed
a
curious
and
on
the
whole
mischievous
conception
of
himself
for
his
humiliating
position
as
a
delicate
and
unpromising
student
at
harvard
law
school
while
his
younger
brothers
wilky
and
robertson
were
officers
in
the
northern
army
and
william
was
pursuing
a
brilliant
academic
career
or
naturalising
with
agassiz
in
south
america
seemed
a
confirmation
of
his
tutors
opinion
that
he
was
an
inarticulate
mediocrity
who
would
never
be
able
to
take
a
hand
in
the
business
of
life
and
so
he
worked
out
a
scheme
of
existence
which
he
accepted
finally
in
an
hour
of
glowing
resignation
when
he
was
returning
by
steamer
to
newport
from
a
visit
to
a
camp
of
wounded
soldiers
at
portsmouth
grove
in
which
the
one
who
stood
aside
and
felt
rather
than
acted
acquired
thereby
a
mystic
value
a
spiritual
supremacy
which
but
this
was
perhaps
a
later
development
of
the
theory
would
be
rubbed
off
by
participation
in
action
it
was
therefore
with
defiant
industry
with
the
intention
of
proving
that
such
as
he
was
he
had
his
peculiar
worth
that
he
set
to
work
to
become
a
writer
his
first
story
was
published
in
atlantic
when
he
was
and
it
was
followed
by
a
number
of
stories
travel
sketches
and
critical
essays
some
of
which
have
been
reprinted
and
a
few
farces
which
have
not
he
also
went
through
a
necessary
preface
of
the
literary
life
by
reading
the
proofs
of
george
eliot
novels
before
they
appeared
in
the
and
reviewing
the
profession
of
literature
differs
from
that
of
the
stage
in
that
the
stars
begin
instead
of
ending
as
dressers
in
he
went
to
europe
and
gaining
certain
impressions
that
had
been
inaccessible
to
him
as
a
child
finally
fixed
the
dye
in
which
his
talent
was
to
be
immersed
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
stepped
for
the
first
time
into
a
private
park
of
great
oaks
where
i
knew
my
first
sense
of
a
matter
afterwards
through
fortunate
years
to
be
more
fully
disclosed
the
springtime
in
such
places
the
adored
footpath
the
first
primroses
the
stir
and
scent
of
renascence
in
the
watered
sunshine
and
under
spreading
boughs
that
were
somehow
before
aught
else
the
still
reach
of
the
remembered
lines
of
tennyson
he
was
admitted
to
the
homes
of
ruskin
rossetti
morris
darwin
and
george
eliot
and
allowed
to
see
the
wheels
go
round
but
the
real
significance
of
this
journey
to
mr
james
genius
is
the
part
it
played
in
the
last
days
of
his
beautiful
cousin
mary
temple
she
should
have
had
before
her
a
long
career
of
nobility
for
she
was
absolutely
afraid
of
nothing
she
might
come
to
by
living
with
enough
sincerity
and
enough
wonder
she
pretended
not
to
know
that
she
had
been
cheated
out
of
this
but
as
she
lay
on
the
that
she
would
not
admit
to
be
even
a
her
eyes
were
fixed
intensely
on
the
progress
of
her
cousin
through
all
the
experiences
that
should
have
been
hers
there
came
a
day
when
all
illusion
failed
and
she
died
dreadfully
clinging
to
consciousness
her
death
was
felt
by
henry
and
william
james
as
the
end
of
their
youth
that
as
mr
james
would
have
said
is
the
the
must
was
trodden
out
it
had
only
to
ferment
to
be
bottled
to
be
mellowed
by
time
into
the
perfect
wine
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
innumerable
volumes
that
mr
james
was
to
pour
out
in
the
next
years
of
which
the
intimation
is
not
present
in
these
first
adventures
ii
the
international
situation
it
is
no
use
turning
up
those
first
stories
that
appeared
in
atlantic
and
unless
one
has
formed
an
affection
for
the
literary
personality
of
mr
james
the
image
they
provoke
of
the
literary
prentice
bending
over
his
task
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
reflectively
protruding
like
a
small
boy
drawing
on
his
slate
is
amusing
enough
but
they
themselves
are
such
pale
dreams
as
might
visit
a
new
england
spinster
looking
out
from
her
parlour
on
a
grey
drizzling
day
where
there
is
any
richness
of
effect
as
in
romance
of
certain
old
it
comes
from
the
influence
of
nathaniel
hawthorne
that
story
which
tells
how
a
girl
loved
her
sister
husband
waited
eagerly
for
her
death
that
she
might
marry
him
and
later
wheedled
from
him
the
key
of
the
chest
in
which
the
dead
wife
had
left
her
finery
to
await
her
baby
daughter
maturity
is
prelude
and
the
catastrophe
which
is
the
finding
of
the
girl
kneeling
dead
beside
the
chest
with
the
mark
of
phantom
fingers
on
her
throat
comes
with
too
short
and
small
a
report
but
in
spite
of
its
pitiful
construction
it
is
the
only
one
of
the
dozen
stories
which
mr
james
published
before
his
visit
to
europe
in
that
shows
any
of
the
imaginative
exuberance
which
one
accepts
as
an
earnest
of
coming
genius
hawthorne
was
not
altogether
a
happy
influence
it
is
due
to
him
that
mr
james
characters
have
almost
wailed
their
way
from
passionate
to
golden
but
he
certainly
shepherded
mr
james
into
the
european
environment
and
lent
him
a
framework
on
which
to
drape
his
emotions
until
he
had
discovered
his
own
power
to
build
up
an
imaginative
structure
the
plot
of
passionate
with
its
american
who
comes
to
england
to
claim
a
cousin
estate
falls
in
love
with
the
usurper
sister
is
driven
from
the
door
and
dies
just
after
the
usurper
death
has
delivered
to
him
all
he
wants
is
very
clumsy
hawthorne
but
in
those
days
mr
james
could
not
draw
normal
events
and
he
had
to
have
some
medium
for
expressing
his
wealth
of
feeling
about
england
it
is
amazing
to
see
how
rich
that
wealth
already
was
how
much
deeper
than
mere
pleasure
in
travel
was
his
delight
in
the
parks
and
private
grandeurs
of
england
and
how
too
a
fundamental
fallacy
was
already
perverting
it
to
an
almost
calvinist
distrust
of
the
activities
of
the
present
i
entered
upon
life
a
perfect
gentleman
says
the
american
as
he
sits
in
hampton
court
i
had
the
love
of
old
forms
and
pleasant
rites
and
i
found
them
nowhere
found
a
world
all
hard
lines
and
harsh
lights
without
lines
without
composition
as
they
say
of
pictures
without
the
lovely
mystery
of
colour
sitting
here
in
this
old
park
in
this
old
country
i
feel
that
i
hover
on
the
misty
verge
of
what
might
have
been
i
should
have
been
born
here
not
there
here
my
makeshift
distinctions
would
have
found
things
they
have
been
true
of
this
is
a
world
i
could
have
got
on
with
beautifully
there
you
have
the
first
statement
of
the
persistent
illusion
to
which
he
was
helped
by
his
odd
lack
of
the
historic
sense
and
which
confused
his
estimate
of
modern
life
that
the
past
would
have
been
a
happier
home
for
those
who
like
himself
loved
fastidious
living
he
had
a
tremendous
sense
of
the
thing
that
is
and
none
at
all
of
the
thing
that
has
been
and
thus
he
was
always
being
misled
by
such
lovely
shells
of
the
past
as
hampton
court
into
the
belief
that
the
past
which
inhabited
them
was
as
lovely
the
calm
of
canterbury
close
appeared
to
him
as
a
remnant
of
a
time
when
all
england
bowed
before
the
church
was
as
calm
whereas
the
calm
is
really
a
modern
condition
brought
about
when
the
church
ceased
to
have
anything
to
do
with
england
he
never
perceived
that
life
is
always
a
little
painful
at
the
moment
not
only
at
this
moment
but
at
all
moments
that
the
wine
of
experience
always
makes
a
raw
draught
when
it
has
just
been
trodden
out
from
bruised
grapes
by
the
pitiless
feet
of
men
that
it
must
be
subject
to
time
before
it
acquires
suavity
the
lack
of
this
perception
matters
little
in
his
early
work
but
it
is
vastly
important
in
shaping
his
later
phases
there
are
no
such
personal
revelations
in
madonna
of
the
nor
anything
indeed
at
all
characteristic
of
mr
james
there
is
beauty
in
the
tale
of
the
american
painter
who
dreams
over
a
model
for
twenty
years
while
he
and
she
grow
old
and
leaves
at
his
death
nothing
more
to
show
for
his
dreams
than
a
cracked
blank
canvas
and
the
florentine
background
is
worked
on
diligently
and
affectionately
but
it
is
admirable
in
quite
an
uncharacteristic
way
like
a
figure
picture
painted
with
the
utmost
brilliance
of
technique
and
from
perfect
models
by
a
painter
whose
real
passion
was
for
landscape
yet
it
was
only
a
year
later
in
de
that
mr
james
found
himself
both
his
manner
and
the
core
of
the
matter
which
was
to
occupy
him
for
the
happiest
part
of
his
literary
life
euphemia
de
mauves
the
prim
young
american
who
moves
languidly
through
the
turfy
avenues
of
the
french
forest
her
faith
in
decency
of
living
perpetually
outraged
by
her
husband
infidelities
and
his
odd
demand
that
she
should
make
him
a
cuckold
so
that
at
least
he
should
not
have
the
discomfort
of
looking
up
at
her
is
the
first
of
the
many
exquisite
women
whom
mr
james
brought
into
being
by
his
capacity
to
imagine
characters
solidly
and
completely
his
perception
of
the
subtle
tones
of
life
and
his
extreme
verbal
delicacy
and
she
is
given
a
still
greater
importance
by
the
queer
twist
at
the
end
of
the
story
by
which
de
mauves
blows
his
brains
out
for
no
reason
at
all
but
that
he
is
hopelessly
helplessly
romantically
in
love
with
this
cold
wife
who
will
be
so
unreasonable
about
trifles
mr
james
writes
her
story
not
only
as
though
he
stood
upon
the
atlantic
shores
looking
eastward
at
the
plight
of
a
compatriot
domiciled
with
lewd
men
and
light
women
but
also
as
though
he
sat
in
the
company
of
certain
gracious
men
and
women
of
the
world
who
could
not
get
under
way
with
their
accomplishment
of
charm
because
the
grim
alien
in
the
corner
will
keep
prodding
them
with
a
disapproval
as
out
of
place
in
this
salon
as
a
deal
plank
madame
de
mauves
in
fine
is
the
first
figure
invented
by
mr
james
to
throw
light
upon
what
he
called
the
international
situation
it
took
all
mr
james
cosmopolitan
training
to
see
that
there
existed
an
international
situation
that
the
fact
that
americans
visited
europe
constituted
a
drama
an
englishman
who
visited
italy
did
no
more
than
take
a
look
at
a
more
richly
coloured
order
of
life
that
braced
him
up
as
any
gay
spectacle
might
have
done
to
return
to
his
own
his
travel
was
a
pleasure
or
at
most
if
he
happened
to
be
a
landor
or
a
browning
an
inspiration
it
might
reasonably
be
supposed
that
the
visit
to
europe
of
an
american
was
no
greater
matter
but
mr
james
knew
that
the
wealthy
american
was
in
the
position
of
a
man
who
has
built
a
comfortable
house
and
has
plenty
of
money
over
yet
can
not
furnish
it
because
furniture
is
neither
made
nor
sold
in
his
country
until
he
has
crossed
the
sea
to
the
land
where
they
do
make
furniture
he
must
sleep
and
eat
on
the
floor
one
might
enumerate
he
writes
in
those
early
days
the
items
of
high
civilisation
as
it
exists
in
other
countries
which
are
absent
from
the
texture
of
american
life
until
it
should
become
a
wonder
what
was
left
no
state
in
the
european
sense
of
the
word
and
indeed
barely
a
specific
national
name
no
sovereign
no
court
no
personal
loyalty
no
aristocracy
there
follows
a
long
list
so
long
as
to
provoke
the
natural
remark
that
if
these
things
are
left
out
everything
is
left
out
and
mr
james
goes
on
to
complain
it
takes
so
many
things
such
an
accumulation
of
history
and
custom
such
a
complexity
of
manners
and
types
to
form
a
fund
of
suggestion
for
a
novelist
he
wrote
novelist
because
at
the
moment
he
was
criticising
hawthorne
but
he
would
certainly
have
applied
his
phrase
to
anyone
who
desired
his
life
to
be
not
a
corduroy
track
but
a
marble
terrace
with
palaces
on
the
one
hand
and
fair
gardens
on
the
other
since
the
pilgrimage
for
these
items
of
high
civilisation
appeared
to
europeans
as
innumerable
contemporary
allusions
show
it
did
as
mere
the
pilgrims
themselves
were
likely
to
be
as
misunderstood
for
one
thing
although
they
were
unorganised
so
far
as
culture
went
they
formed
at
home
a
very
cohesive
moral
community
the
american
women
who
came
to
europe
took
for
granted
that
however
people
might
be
habited
people
that
is
whose
manners
showed
them
nice
and
in
whatever
frivolous
array
they
might
be
flounced
and
ribboned
they
were
certain
to
wear
next
their
skin
the
of
puritan
rectitude
the
innocent
freedoms
which
they
permitted
themselves
because
they
held
this
supposition
and
the
terrifying
surmises
to
which
these
gave
rise
in
the
mind
of
the
old
world
unaware
of
the
innocence
of
the
new
made
much
material
for
drama
and
more
dramatic
still
was
the
moment
which
came
to
so
many
of
the
travellers
who
formed
close
personal
relationships
with
europeans
when
they
realised
that
the
moral
standards
to
which
they
had
nationally
pledged
themselves
and
which
they
individually
obeyed
with
extraordinary
fidelity
were
here
regarded
as
simply
dowdy
compromise
was
the
cry
of
latin
and
even
english
society
compromise
on
every
and
any
of
the
commandments
you
like
do
anything
you
can
in
fact
to
rub
down
those
rude
angles
you
present
to
human
intercourse
and
yet
it
was
not
to
be
deduced
that
europe
was
lax
one
had
only
to
look
behind
the
superficial
show
to
see
that
it
had
its
own
religion
perhaps
a
more
terrible
religion
than
any
new
england
ever
knew
and
that
what
seemed
its
laziest
pleasures
were
sometimes
its
most
dreadful
rites
this
last
conception
of
europe
is
the
subject
of
is
not
a
good
book
it
throws
a
light
upon
the
lack
of
attention
given
at
that
period
to
the
art
of
writing
that
within
a
few
years
of
each
other
two
men
of
great
genius
thomas
hardy
and
henry
james
wrote
in
their
thirties
first
novels
spoilt
by
technical
blemishes
of
a
sort
that
the
most
giftless
modern
miss
with
a
subscription
to
mudie
would
never
commit
in
her
first
literary
experiment
is
wooden
it
is
crammed
with
local
colour
like
a
schoolmistress
bedroom
full
of
photographs
of
rome
it
has
a
plain
boiled
suet
heroine
called
mary
but
its
idea
is
magnificent
an
american
of
fortune
takes
hudson
who
has
already
shown
talent
as
a
sculptor
from
his
stool
in
a
lawyer
office
in
northampton
massachusetts
and
sets
him
up
in
a
studio
in
rome
it
is
the
fear
of
old
mrs
hudson
and
of
mary
his
fiancée
that
european
life
will
be
too
soft
for
him
but
the
very
opposite
occurs
it
is
he
who
is
too
soft
for
european
life
the
business
of
art
means
not
only
lounging
under
the
pines
of
the
villa
ludovisi
and
chiselling
the
noble
substance
of
carrara
marble
it
means
also
the
painful
toil
of
creation
which
demands
from
the
artist
an
austerer
renunciation
of
every
grossness
than
was
ever
expected
of
any
citizen
of
northampton
which
sends
a
man
naked
and
alone
to
awful
moments
which
if
he
be
strong
give
him
spiritual
strength
but
if
he
be
weak
heap
on
him
the
black
weakness
of
neurasthenia
and
when
that
has
turned
him
into
a
raw
hurt
raging
creature
he
is
further
snared
by
the
loveliness
of
christina
light
who
is
characteristically
european
in
that
her
circumstances
have
not
the
same
clear
beauty
as
her
face
she
is
being
hawked
over
the
continent
to
find
a
rich
husband
by
her
mother
and
a
cavaliere
who
is
really
her
father
and
this
ugly
girlhood
has
so
corrupted
her
vigorous
spirit
that
the
young
american
courtship
provokes
from
her
nothing
but
eccentric
favours
or
perverse
insults
after
the
collapse
of
his
art
and
his
love
roderick
falls
over
a
precipice
in
a
too
minutely
described
switzerland
hurled
by
a
which
has
inspired
mr
james
to
one
of
his
broadest
jokes
in
the
first
edition
roderick
on
hearing
that
while
he
has
been
vexing
his
benefactor
with
his
moods
that
gentleman
has
been
manfully
repressing
a
passion
for
mary
exclaims
it
like
something
in
a
novel
which
mr
james
in
the
definitive
edition
has
altered
to
it
like
something
in
a
bad
novel
this
conception
of
europe
as
a
complex
organism
which
would
have
no
use
or
only
a
cruel
use
for
those
bred
by
the
simple
organism
of
america
animates
that
exquisite
short
story
which
came
first
of
all
of
the
many
masterpieces
that
mr
james
was
to
produce
it
is
the
tale
of
a
little
schoolmistress
who
having
long
nourished
a
passion
for
europe
upon
such
slender
intimations
as
photographs
of
the
castle
of
chillon
at
last
collects
a
sum
for
the
trip
is
met
at
havre
by
a
cousin
one
of
those
americans
on
whom
continental
life
has
acted
as
a
solvent
of
all
decent
moral
tissues
and
is
tricked
out
of
her
money
by
his
story
of
a
runaway
marriage
with
a
countess
returns
to
new
england
hoping
to
see
something
of
this
dear
old
europe
yet
and
has
that
hope
ironically
fulfilled
by
the
descent
upon
her
for
life
of
the
said
countess
who
is
so
distinctly
something
of
this
dear
old
europe
that
the
very
sight
of
her
transports
the
travelled
recounter
of
the
story
to
some
dusky
landing
before
a
shabby
parisian
to
an
open
door
revealing
a
greasy
and
to
madame
leaning
over
the
banisters
while
she
holds
a
faded
together
and
bawls
down
to
the
portress
to
bring
up
her
coffee
it
is
one
of
the
saddest
stories
in
the
world
and
one
of
the
cleverest
there
is
not
one
of
its
simple
phrases
but
has
its
beautiful
bearing
on
the
subject
and
in
the
treatment
of
emotional
values
one
sees
that
the
essays
on
poets
and
which
for
some
years
he
had
been
sending
to
america
with
the
excited
air
of
a
missionary
were
the
notes
of
an
attentive
pupil
detachment
was
the
lesson
that
that
period
preached
in
its
reaction
against
the
george
sand
method
whereby
the
author
rolled
through
his
pages
locked
in
an
embrace
with
his
subject
we
have
forgotten
its
real
significance
so
frequently
has
it
been
used
as
an
excuse
for
the
treatment
of
emotional
situations
with
encyclopædic
detail
of
circumstance
and
not
a
grain
of
emotional
realisation
but
here
we
can
recover
it
the
author
pity
for
the
schoolmistress
is
never
allowed
to
make
his
countess
sinister
instead
of
gross
and
his
sense
of
the
comic
in
the
countess
is
never
allowed
to
make
the
schoolmistress
woe
more
dreary
the
situation
stands
as
solid
and
has
as
many
aspects
as
it
would
have
in
life
still
holds
this
view
of
europe
its
theme
to
quote
mr
james
in
the
preface
of
the
definitive
edition
is
the
situation
in
another
country
and
an
aristocratic
society
of
some
robust
but
insidiously
beguiled
and
betrayed
some
cruelly
wronged
compatriot
the
point
being
in
especial
that
he
should
suffer
at
the
hands
of
persons
pretending
to
represent
the
highest
possible
civilisation
and
to
be
of
an
order
far
superior
to
his
own
christopher
newman
the
robust
compatriot
is
such
a
large
simple
lovable
person
that
the
rest
of
the
story
leads
one
to
suspect
that
one
may
say
of
mr
james
as
he
said
of
balzac
that
his
figures
as
a
general
thing
are
better
than
the
use
he
makes
of
them
he
walks
through
europe
examining
its
culture
with
such
an
effect
on
the
natives
as
an
amiable
buffalo
traversing
the
galerie
might
produce
upon
the
copyists
of
the
louvre
and
finally
presents
himself
at
the
house
where
he
is
least
welcome
in
the
world
the
home
of
the
de
bellegardes
a
proud
and
ancient
royalist
family
thereafter
the
novel
is
an
exposition
of
the
way
things
do
not
happen
claire
de
cintré
the
widowed
daughter
whom
newman
desires
to
marry
is
represented
as
having
above
all
things
beauty
of
character
but
when
her
family
snatches
her
from
him
in
a
frenzy
of
pride
she
allows
herself
to
be
bundled
into
a
convent
with
a
weakness
that
would
convict
of
imbecility
any
woman
of
and
since
her
mother
and
brother
had
murdered
her
father
by
refusing
him
medicine
at
a
physical
crisis
and
sustained
themselves
in
the
act
by
the
reflection
that
after
all
they
were
only
keeping
up
the
good
old
family
tone
one
wonders
where
she
got
this
beauty
of
character
the
child
of
this
damned
house
might
have
flamed
with
a
strange
fire
but
she
could
not
have
diffused
a
rectory
but
the
series
of
inconsistencies
of
which
this
is
only
one
leads
like
a
jolting
that
puts
one
down
at
hampton
court
to
an
exquisite
situation
newman
discovers
the
secret
of
the
marquis
murder
and
intends
to
publish
it
as
a
punishment
for
the
cruel
wrong
the
de
bellegardes
have
done
him
but
sacrifices
this
satisfaction
simply
because
there
can
be
no
link
not
even
the
link
of
revenge
between
such
as
they
and
such
as
he
in
all
literature
there
is
no
passage
so
full
of
the
very
passion
of
moral
exaltation
as
the
description
of
how
newman
stands
before
the
carmelite
house
in
the
rue
and
looks
up
at
the
blank
discoloured
wall
behind
which
his
lost
lady
is
immured
then
walks
back
to
notre
dame
and
there
the
bells
chiming
off
into
space
at
long
intervals
the
big
bronze
syllables
of
the
word
decides
that
such
things
as
revenge
were
really
not
his
game
so
it
is
with
mr
james
to
the
end
the
foreground
is
as
often
as
not
red
with
the
blood
of
slaughtered
probabilities
a
gentleman
at
a
tells
the
lady
on
his
left
a
perfect
stranger
who
never
appears
again
in
the
story
that
some
years
ago
he
proposed
to
the
lady
in
white
sitting
opposite
to
them
a
curio
dealer
calls
on
a
lady
in
portland
place
just
to
wind
up
the
plot
but
the
great
glow
at
the
back
the
emotional
conflagration
is
always
right
marks
the
first
time
when
mr
james
took
the
international
situation
as
a
joke
and
he
could
joke
very
happily
in
those
days
when
his
sentence
was
a
straight
young
thing
that
could
run
where
it
liked
instead
of
a
delicate
creature
swathed
in
relative
clauses
as
an
invalid
in
shawls
there
is
no
other
book
by
mr
james
which
has
quite
the
clear
sunlit
charm
of
this
description
of
the
visit
of
eugenia
the
morganatically
married
baroness
and
her
brother
felix
the
bohemian
painter
to
their
cousins
new
england
farm
there
is
nothing
at
all
to
their
discredit
in
the
past
of
these
two
graceful
young
people
but
they
resemble
harlequin
and
columbine
in
the
instability
of
their
existence
and
the
sharp
line
they
draw
between
their
privacy
and
their
publicity
it
appears
to
them
natural
that
the
private
life
should
be
spent
largely
in
wondering
how
the
last
public
appearance
went
off
and
planning
effects
for
the
next
a
point
of
view
which
arouses
the
worst
suspicions
in
their
cousins
who
are
accustomed
to
live
as
though
the
sky
were
indeed
a
broad
open
eye
so
felix
has
the
greatest
difficulty
in
persuading
his
uncle
who
takes
bites
to
a
moral
decision
just
as
mr
gladstone
took
bites
to
a
mouthful
that
he
is
a
suitable
husband
for
his
cousin
gertrude
and
poor
eugenia
fails
altogether
in
an
environment
where
a
lie
from
her
lips
is
not
treated
as
petit
péché
petite
but
remains
simply
a
lie
the
frame
of
mind
this
state
of
affairs
produces
in
the
poor
lady
is
exquisitely
described
in
a
passage
which
shows
her
going
wistfully
through
the
house
of
the
man
who
did
not
propose
to
her
because
he
detected
her
lie
after
a
visit
to
his
dying
mother
mrs
acton
had
told
eugenia
that
her
would
be
in
the
hall
to
show
her
downstairs
but
the
large
landing
outside
her
door
was
empty
and
eugenia
stood
there
looking
about
she
passed
slowly
downstairs
still
looking
about
the
broad
staircase
made
a
great
bend
and
in
the
angle
was
a
high
window
looking
westward
with
a
deep
bench
covered
with
a
row
of
flowering
plants
in
curious
old
pots
of
blue
the
yellow
afternoon
light
came
in
through
the
flowers
and
flickered
a
little
on
the
white
wainscots
eugenia
paused
a
moment
the
house
was
perfectly
still
save
for
the
ticking
somewhere
of
a
great
clock
the
lower
hall
stretched
away
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
half
covered
over
with
a
large
oriental
rug
eugenia
lingered
a
little
noticing
a
great
many
things
bien
she
said
to
herself
such
a
large
solid
irreproachable
basis
of
existence
the
place
seemed
to
her
to
indicate
and
then
she
reflected
that
mrs
acton
was
soon
to
withdraw
from
it
the
reflection
accompanied
her
the
rest
of
the
way
downstairs
where
she
paused
again
making
more
observations
the
hall
was
extremely
broad
and
on
either
side
of
the
front
door
was
a
wide
window
which
threw
the
shadows
of
everything
back
into
the
house
there
were
chairs
along
the
wall
and
big
eastern
vases
upon
tables
and
on
either
side
a
large
cabinet
with
a
glass
front
and
little
curiosities
within
dimly
gleaming
the
doors
were
open
into
the
darkened
parlour
the
library
the
all
these
rooms
seemed
empty
eugenia
passed
along
and
stopped
a
moment
on
the
threshold
of
each
bien
she
murmured
again
she
had
thought
of
just
such
a
house
as
this
when
she
decided
to
come
to
america
she
opened
the
front
door
for
herself
her
light
tread
had
summoned
none
of
the
servants
and
on
the
threshold
she
gave
a
last
look
that
is
the
pure
note
of
the
early
james
like
a
pipe
played
carefully
by
a
boy
it
sounds
as
beautifully
in
that
short
novel
which
though
it
deals
with
conditions
peculiar
to
a
small
section
of
continental
life
forty
years
ago
will
strike
each
new
generation
afresh
as
sad
and
lovely
daisy
who
is
like
one
of
those
girls
who
smile
upon
us
from
the
covers
of
american
magazines
glaringly
beautiful
and
healthy
but
without
the
tone
given
by
diligent
study
of
the
grace
of
conduct
comes
to
europe
and
plays
in
its
sunshine
like
a
happy
child
she
wants
to
go
to
the
castle
of
chillon
so
she
accepts
the
escort
for
the
afternoon
of
a
young
american
who
is
staying
at
the
same
hotel
she
likes
to
walk
in
the
pincian
so
she
takes
a
stroll
there
one
afternoon
with
a
certain
roman
the
woman
who
does
a
thing
for
the
sake
of
the
thing
in
itself
is
always
suspected
by
society
and
the
american
colony
which
professes
the
mellow
conventions
of
europe
with
all
its
own
national
crudity
accuses
her
of
vulgarity
and
even
lightness
they
talk
so
bitterly
that
when
the
young
american
who
is
half
in
love
with
daisy
finds
her
viewing
the
colosseum
by
moonlight
with
the
roman
he
leaps
to
the
conclusion
that
she
is
a
disreputable
woman
why
he
does
so
is
not
quite
clear
since
surely
it
is
the
essential
thing
about
a
disreputable
woman
that
her
evenings
are
not
free
for
visits
to
the
colosseum
poor
daisy
takes
in
part
of
his
meaning
and
saying
in
a
little
strange
voice
i
do
care
whether
i
get
roman
fever
or
not
goes
back
to
her
hotel
and
dies
of
malaria
and
the
young
american
staring
at
the
raw
protuberance
among
the
april
daisies
in
the
protestant
cemetery
learns
from
the
roman
lips
that
daisy
was
most
innocent
it
is
a
lyric
whose
beauty
may
be
measured
by
the
attention
which
in
spite
of
its
tragedy
it
everywhere
provoked
it
was
interesting
to
note
how
often
in
the
obituary
notices
of
mr
james
it
was
said
that
he
had
never
attained
popularity
for
it
shows
how
soon
london
forgets
its
gifts
of
fame
from
to
to
put
it
roughly
all
england
and
america
were
as
captivated
by
the
clear
beauty
of
mr
james
work
as
in
the
nineties
they
were
hypnotised
by
the
beauty
of
mr
kipling
art
on
london
staircases
everyone
turned
to
look
at
the
american
with
the
long
silky
black
beard
which
i
am
told
by
one
who
met
him
then
gave
him
the
appearance
of
an
elizabethan
sea
captain
but
for
all
the
exquisiteness
of
there
were
discernible
in
it
certain
black
lines
which
like
the
dark
veining
in
a
crocus
that
foretells
its
decay
showed
that
this
was
a
loveliness
which
was
in
the
very
act
of
passing
the
young
american
might
have
been
so
worked
upon
by
his
friends
that
he
could
readily
believe
his
daisy
a
light
woman
but
he
need
not
have
manifested
his
acceptance
of
this
belief
by
being
grossly
rude
to
her
and
by
reflecting
that
if
after
daisy
return
there
had
been
an
exchange
of
jokes
between
the
porter
and
the
it
had
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
serious
regret
to
him
that
the
little
american
flirt
should
be
about
by
menials
when
one
remembers
the
grave
courtesy
with
which
christopher
newman
treated
mlle
noémie
nioche
the
little
french
drab
who
called
herself
esprit
it
is
plain
that
we
are
no
longer
dealing
with
the
same
mr
james
the
mr
james
we
are
to
deal
with
henceforth
had
ceased
to
be
an
american
and
had
lost
his
native
reactions
to
emotional
stimuli
he
was
becoming
a
european
and
for
several
years
to
come
was
to
spend
his
time
slowly
mastering
its
conventions
which
means
that
he
was
learning
a
new
emotional
language
the
first
works
he
produced
when
he
was
at
once
a
finished
writer
and
only
the
cocoon
of
a
european
present
the
paradoxical
appearance
of
being
perfect
in
phrase
and
incredibly
naive
in
their
estimates
of
persons
and
situations
pension
that
melancholy
tale
of
the
ailing
old
american
whose
wife
and
daughter
have
dragged
him
off
on
an
expensive
trip
to
europe
while
ruin
falls
on
his
untended
business
in
new
york
has
its
tone
of
pathos
spoiled
by
extraordinarily
and
to
women
of
extremely
unsavoury
discussions
of
how
a
girl
ought
to
behave
if
she
wants
to
be
married
siege
of
which
is
the
story
of
a
texan
adventuress
of
many
divorces
who
marries
into
an
english
county
family
fails
to
produce
the
designed
effect
of
outrage
because
the
adventuress
is
the
only
person
who
shows
any
signs
of
human
worth
and
the
life
which
she
is
supposed
to
have
violated
by
her
marriage
is
suggested
simply
by
statements
that
the
people
concerned
had
titles
and
lived
in
large
houses
in
which
describes
a
german
diplomat
amazement
that
an
unmarried
girl
can
be
a
social
success
in
america
we
feel
as
bored
as
we
would
if
we
were
forced
to
listen
to
the
exclamations
of
a
on
finding
that
a
pekingese
with
regular
features
had
got
a
prize
at
a
dog
show
in
which
tells
how
a
peer
daughter
who
marries
an
american
millionaire
refuses
to
live
in
america
the
american
picture
is
painted
with
the
flatness
of
a
flagging
interest
and
we
suspect
mr
james
of
taking
english
architecture
as
an
index
of
english
character
he
had
still
to
grasp
the
paradox
that
the
people
who
live
in
the
solidities
of
grosvenor
square
are
the
best
colonising
and
seafaring
stock
in
the
world
in
wherein
an
american
girl
guilelessly
prattles
to
a
newspaper
correspondent
about
the
affairs
of
her
french
fiancé
family
and
is
cast
out
by
them
when
he
publishes
her
prattlings
in
the
states
we
seem
to
see
the
international
situation
slowly
fading
from
mr
james
immediate
consciousness
in
turning
over
its
pages
we
see
the
author
sitting
down
before
a
pile
of
white
paper
and
finely
inscribing
it
with
memories
of
past
contacts
with
americans
we
do
not
see
him
entering
his
study
with
traces
still
on
his
lips
of
a
smile
provoked
in
the
street
outside
by
the
loveliness
and
innocent
barbarism
of
his
compatriots
in
those
days
he
had
lost
america
and
had
not
yet
found
europe
but
he
was
to
find
it
very
soon
in
london
the
tale
of
an
innocent
american
girl
who
comes
over
to
live
with
her
sister
and
her
aristocratic
english
husband
and
stands
appalled
at
their
debts
their
debaucheries
their
infidelities
he
has
rendered
beautifully
the
feeling
caused
by
ill
lives
when
led
in
old
homes
of
elmy
parks
and
honourable
histories
it
is
a
sense
of
disgust
such
as
comes
to
the
guest
who
goes
into
a
in
the
morning
and
finds
last
night
and
decanters
and
cigarette
ends
looking
dreadful
in
the
sunlight
the
house
is
being
badly
managed
it
will
go
to
rack
and
ruin
that
is
an
aspect
of
england
but
the
american
onlooker
is
just
a
little
thing
that
might
have
bloomed
anywhere
and
all
references
to
her
americanness
are
dragged
in
with
an
effort
it
is
plain
that
he
had
lost
all
his
love
for
the
international
situation
that
mr
james
continued
to
write
about
americans
in
europe
long
after
their
common
motive
and
their
individual
adventures
had
ceased
to
excite
his
wonder
or
his
sympathy
was
the
manifestation
of
a
certain
delusion
about
his
art
which
was
ultimately
to
do
him
a
mischief
he
believed
that
if
one
a
subject
one
could
write
about
it
and
since
there
was
no
aspect
of
the
international
situation
with
which
he
was
not
familiar
he
could
not
see
why
the
description
of
these
aspects
should
not
easily
make
art
the
profound
truth
that
an
artist
should
feel
passion
for
his
subject
was
naturally
distasteful
to
one
who
wanted
to
live
wholly
without
violence
even
of
the
emotions
a
preference
for
passionless
detachment
was
at
that
date
the
mode
in
french
literature
which
was
the
only
literature
that
he
studied
with
any
attention
the
de
goncourts
zola
and
even
de
maupassant
thought
that
an
artist
ought
to
be
able
to
lift
any
subject
into
art
by
his
treatment
just
as
an
advertising
agent
ought
to
be
able
to
float
any
article
into
popularity
by
his
posters
but
human
experience
which
includes
a
realisation
of
the
deadness
of
most
of
the
de
goncourts
and
productions
proves
the
contrary
unless
a
subject
is
congenial
to
the
character
of
the
artist
the
subconscious
self
will
not
wake
up
and
reward
the
busy
conscious
mind
by
distributions
of
its
hoarded
riches
in
the
form
of
the
right
word
the
magic
phrase
the
clarifying
incident
why
are
books
about
ideas
so
commonly
bad
since
the
genius
of
anatole
france
and
mr
wells
have
proved
that
they
need
not
be
so
if
it
be
not
that
the
majority
of
people
reserve
passion
for
their
personal
relationships
and
therefore
never
feel
an
idea
with
the
sensitive
of
affection
the
absence
of
this
necessary
attitude
to
his
subject
explains
in
part
the
tenuity
of
mr
james
later
novels
on
the
international
situation
but
there
is
also
another
element
that
irritates
readers
and
makes
the
texture
of
the
life
represented
seem
poor
that
element
which
is
not
peculiar
to
mr
james
but
is
a
part
of
the
social
atmosphere
of
his
time
is
the
persistent
presentation
of
woman
not
as
a
human
but
as
a
sexual
being
one
can
learn
nothing
of
the
heroine
beliefs
and
character
for
the
hullabaloo
that
has
been
set
up
because
she
has
come
in
too
late
or
gone
out
too
early
or
omitted
to
provide
herself
with
that
figure
of
questionable
use
for
the
manners
of
the
young
men
forbid
the
thought
that
she
was
there
to
protect
the
girl
from
assault
and
the
mild
tongues
of
the
young
ladies
make
it
unlikely
that
the
duel
of
the
sexes
was
then
so
bitter
that
they
required
an
umpire
the
chaperon
it
appears
that
the
young
woman
of
that
period
could
get
through
the
world
only
by
perpetually
jumping
through
hoops
held
up
to
her
by
society
a
method
of
progression
which
was
more
suited
to
circus
girls
than
to
persons
of
dignity
and
which
sometimes
caused
nasty
falls
there
is
nothing
more
humiliating
to
women
in
all
fiction
than
the
end
of
london
where
the
heroine
appalled
at
having
been
left
in
an
opera
box
alone
with
a
young
man
turns
to
him
and
begs
him
although
she
knows
well
that
he
does
not
love
her
to
marry
her
and
save
her
good
name
purity
and
innocence
are
excellent
things
but
a
world
in
which
they
have
to
be
guarded
by
such
cramping
contrivances
of
conduct
is
as
ridiculous
as
a
heaven
where
the
saints
all
go
about
with
their
haloes
protected
by
mackintosh
covers
iii
transition
mr
james
first
important
work
that
does
not
deal
with
the
international
situation
is
a
work
of
great
genius
into
the
small
mould
of
the
story
of
how
a
plain
and
stupid
girl
was
jilted
by
a
when
he
discovered
that
she
would
be
disinherited
by
her
contemptuous
father
on
her
marriage
mr
james
concentrated
all
the
sense
which
he
had
absorbed
throughout
his
childhood
of
the
simple
provincial
life
which
went
on
behind
the
brown
stone
of
old
new
york
it
has
in
it
a
wealth
of
feeling
that
does
not
seem
to
have
originated
with
mr
james
just
as
an
old
wives
tale
told
over
and
over
again
by
the
fireside
becomes
charged
with
a
synthetic
emotion
derived
from
the
comments
and
expressions
of
innumerable
auditors
and
one
may
surmise
that
catherine
tragedy
was
first
presented
to
him
as
an
item
of
local
gossip
sympathetically
discussed
by
his
charming
new
york
cousins
and
friends
certainly
the
tale
of
this
dull
girl
who
was
twenty
years
old
before
she
treated
herself
for
evening
wear
to
a
red
satin
gown
trimmed
with
gold
fringe
and
progressed
by
such
clumsinesses
through
a
career
of
which
the
only
remarkable
facts
were
that
morris
townsend
had
trifled
with
her
affection
and
that
her
father
had
broken
its
spring
is
consecrated
by
an
element
of
pity
which
was
afterwards
signally
to
disappear
from
mr
james
work
the
book
so
beautifully
expresses
the
woe
of
all
those
people
to
whom
nothing
ever
happens
who
are
aware
of
the
gay
challenge
of
life
but
are
prevented
by
something
leaden
in
their
substance
from
responding
that
one
is
not
surprised
to
find
that
like
most
good
stories
about
inarticulate
people
like
and
coeur
it
is
written
with
the
most
deliberate
cunning
the
story
is
evoked
according
to
turgeniev
method
of
calling
his
novels
out
of
the
inchoate
real
world
and
what
that
is
had
better
since
mr
james
had
been
using
it
with
increasing
power
since
be
stated
in
his
own
words
i
have
always
fondly
remembered
a
remark
that
i
heard
fall
years
ago
from
the
lips
of
ivan
turgeniev
in
regard
to
his
own
experience
of
the
usual
origin
of
the
fictive
picture
it
began
for
him
almost
always
with
the
vision
of
some
person
or
persons
who
hovered
before
him
soliciting
him
as
the
active
or
passive
figure
interesting
him
and
appealing
to
him
just
as
they
were
and
by
what
they
were
he
saw
them
in
that
fashion
as
saw
them
subject
to
the
chances
the
complications
of
existence
and
saw
them
vividly
but
then
had
to
find
for
them
the
right
relations
those
that
would
most
bring
them
out
to
imagine
to
invent
and
select
and
piece
together
the
situations
most
useful
and
favourable
to
the
sense
of
the
creatures
themselves
the
complications
they
would
be
most
likely
to
produce
and
to
feel
arrive
at
these
things
is
to
arrive
at
my
story
he
said
that
the
way
i
look
for
it
the
result
is
that
i
often
accused
of
not
having
story
enough
i
seem
to
myself
to
have
as
much
as
i
need
to
show
my
people
to
exhibit
their
relations
with
each
other
for
that
is
all
my
measure
if
i
watch
them
long
enough
i
see
them
come
together
i
see
them
i
see
them
engaged
in
this
or
that
act
and
in
this
or
that
difficulty
how
they
look
and
move
and
speak
and
behave
always
in
the
setting
i
have
found
for
them
is
my
account
of
them
of
which
i
dare
say
alas
cela
manque
souvent
and
as
regards
the
statement
in
prose
of
the
conception
thus
formed
it
is
plain
that
although
mr
james
had
formed
his
irrational
dislike
of
flaubert
many
years
before
it
was
that
great
master
who
had
taught
him
his
art
of
rubbing
down
the
too
brilliant
phrase
to
tone
with
the
quiet
harmony
of
the
whole
of
obliterating
the
exotic
effect
that
would
compromise
the
lorn
simplicity
of
the
subject
this
masterly
use
of
technical
resource
to
unfold
an
idea
whose
beauty
would
to
a
lesser
artist
have
seemed
hopelessly
sheathed
in
obscurity
makes
the
perfect
termination
to
mr
james
first
period
of
genius
it
was
unfortunately
quite
definitely
a
termination
for
until
ten
years
had
passed
mr
james
was
doomed
to
produce
no
work
which
was
not
to
have
the
solidity
of
its
characters
and
the
beauty
of
its
prose
rendered
slightly
ridiculous
by
its
lack
of
purpose
and
unity
in
those
days
when
the
international
theme
was
slipping
from
mr
james
grasp
and
he
was
looking
round
for
another
one
could
no
more
expect
him
to
produce
work
completely
and
serenely
formed
by
the
imagination
than
one
could
ask
an
author
to
continue
his
industry
on
a
journey
from
paris
to
madrid
with
the
jolting
of
the
train
destroying
his
physical
calm
and
the
new
land
crying
for
his
attention
at
the
carriage
window
for
mr
james
was
literally
travelling
all
through
the
eighties
he
was
touring
either
the
countries
of
europe
with
his
body
or
the
art
of
europe
with
his
mind
it
was
his
intention
to
find
that
intellectual
basis
without
which
his
blood
and
upbringing
assured
him
he
would
be
unable
to
use
his
genius
with
noble
or
permanent
results
how
difficult
this
search
was
to
be
and
yet
how
ultimately
fruitful
can
be
judged
from
little
tour
in
that
is
one
of
the
happiest
and
sunniest
travel
books
in
all
literature
non
animum
mutant
qui
trans
mare
but
mr
james
did
and
it
is
as
pleasant
to
see
his
intelligence
sunning
itself
on
the
hot
latin
soil
fresh
and
cool
as
though
he
had
not
years
of
the
creative
struggle
behind
him
and
years
more
to
come
as
it
is
to
see
a
lizard
crawl
from
the
crevice
of
a
provençal
rock
and
play
among
the
tufts
of
rosemary
yet
whenever
mr
james
has
to
note
some
detail
in
his
description
of
french
towns
which
refers
to
the
life
which
has
formed
them
the
reader
fury
mounts
it
is
horrible
that
his
references
to
the
war
should
be
faintly
jocular
and
one
burns
with
shame
for
them
until
one
comes
to
an
amazing
sentence
about
the
french
revolution
in
which
it
is
plainly
implied
that
the
rightness
and
necessity
of
that
declaration
of
the
principle
of
freedom
are
still
debatable
questions
one
perceives
with
relief
that
he
said
these
things
because
as
one
guessed
in
passionate
his
strong
sight
of
the
thing
that
is
was
accompanied
by
blindness
to
the
thing
that
has
been
he
did
not
know
whether
the
war
was
horrible
or
not
because
he
had
been
out
of
europe
when
it
raged
and
because
he
had
not
been
born
at
the
time
he
could
no
more
speak
well
of
the
french
revolution
than
he
could
propose
for
his
club
a
person
whom
he
had
never
met
and
for
the
same
reason
he
failed
to
envisage
the
roman
empire
save
as
a
source
of
agreeable
ruins
which
since
he
did
not
understand
the
spirit
that
built
them
he
imagined
might
have
been
made
still
more
agreeable
their
vastness
did
not
impress
him
as
the
of
the
geological
record
and
history
but
stirred
in
him
that
benevolence
which
is
often
aroused
by
clumsy
largeness
he
patted
the
roman
theatre
at
arles
as
though
it
were
jumbo
at
the
zoo
and
remarked
quite
in
the
manner
of
horace
walpole
that
the
pavement
of
coloured
marble
gives
an
idea
of
the
of
the
interior
but
the
arena
at
nîmes
and
that
vast
high
yellow
aqueduct
whose
three
tiers
appal
the
valley
of
the
gardon
were
too
much
for
him
and
he
pronounced
them
not
at
all
the
man
who
could
write
those
phrases
was
incapable
of
forming
a
philosophy
for
no
man
can
fully
understand
his
kind
unless
he
have
a
revelation
of
old
rome
and
perceive
in
its
works
a
record
of
the
pride
men
felt
in
serviceable
labour
for
the
state
and
yet
what
in
this
particular
case
did
all
that
matter
what
need
was
there
for
mr
james
to
know
anything
but
that
ink
makes
black
expressive
marks
on
paper
when
he
could
tell
so
exquisitely
how
the
château
de
chenonceaux
sends
out
its
white
galleries
across
the
clear
water
of
the
cher
how
the
crenellated
ramparts
of
the
château
look
down
over
hanging
gardens
to
the
loire
and
with
what
peculiar
wonder
carcassonne
and
all
the
other
towns
with
lovely
names
glow
in
the
clear
bright
light
of
france
it
was
enough
that
there
was
no
beauty
on
earth
that
could
daunt
his
power
of
description
the
record
of
his
mental
wanderings
is
not
quite
so
happy
mr
james
has
an
immense
prestige
as
critic
but
a
certain
sentence
that
occurred
more
than
once
in
his
obituary
notices
made
it
doubtful
whether
this
does
not
merely
mean
that
people
have
run
their
eyes
over
the
titles
of
mr
essays
and
have
accepted
the
fact
that
he
dealt
with
authors
rarely
read
by
the
british
as
a
guarantee
of
their
rareness
of
merit
that
it
should
be
reverently
remarked
on
that
most
solemn
occasion
that
flaubert
was
mr
james
adored
master
when
he
had
written
more
than
one
exquisitely
feline
essay
to
delicately
convey
what
a
fluke
it
was
that
this
fellow
who
panted
under
his
phrase
like
a
bricklayer
under
his
hod
should
have
produced
is
just
such
an
ironic
happening
as
he
would
have
liked
to
be
introduced
into
one
of
his
humorous
studies
of
the
literary
life
such
intimations
make
one
guess
that
the
homage
which
england
loves
to
pay
to
the
unread
is
responsible
for
half
mr
reputation
as
a
critic
and
probably
he
owed
the
other
half
to
the
gratitude
of
his
readers
for
a
pleasure
which
is
undoubtedly
given
by
his
critical
writings
but
which
nevertheless
does
not
prove
them
great
criticism
it
is
true
that
poets
and
are
the
best
reviews
ever
written
and
that
it
is
good
to
listen
to
the
old
author
gossiping
in
on
about
the
authors
he
had
known
long
ago
and
to
watch
him
tracing
with
all
his
supreme
genius
for
detecting
personality
the
imprint
of
dead
masters
on
the
fading
surface
of
old
work
but
he
is
always
entirely
lacking
in
that
necessary
element
of
great
criticism
the
capacity
for
universal
reference
the
eye
that
judges
a
work
of
art
should
have
surveyed
the
whole
human
field
so
that
it
can
tell
from
what
clay
this
precious
thing
was
made
in
what
craftsman
cot
that
trick
of
fashioning
was
learned
what
natural
beauty
suggested
to
the
creative
impulse
this
appropriate
form
what
human
institution
helped
or
hindered
its
making
of
that
general
culture
mr
james
was
so
deficient
that
he
was
capable
of
inserting
in
quite
an
intelligent
essay
on
théophile
gautier
this
amazing
sentence
even
his
æsthetic
principles
are
held
with
a
laxity
that
allows
him
for
instance
to
say
in
a
hundred
places
the
most
delightfully
sympathetic
and
pictorial
things
about
the
romantic
or
shakespearean
drama
and
yet
to
describe
a
pedantically
classical
revival
of
the
at
münich
with
the
most
ungrudging
relish
and
while
this
ignorance
was
perpetually
blinding
him
to
the
purpose
of
many
fair
artistic
structures
his
literary
power
was
perpetually
betraying
him
into
the
graceful
and
forceful
publication
of
his
blindness
long
after
one
has
forgotten
all
the
deliverances
of
critics
with
greater
wisdom
but
less
craft
of
phrase
one
remembers
his
extraordinary
opinion
that
flaubert
tentation
de
saint
that
book
which
will
appeal
in
every
generation
to
those
who
have
been
visited
by
the
angel
of
speculative
thought
which
is
not
only
itself
a
beautiful
growth
but
has
borne
beautiful
fruit
in
is
merely
strange
and
has
no
more
reference
to
life
than
the
gimcrack
eastern
pavilion
at
an
exposition
and
he
lacked
moreover
that
necessary
attribute
of
the
good
critic
the
power
to
bid
bad
authors
to
go
to
the
devil
there
are
certain
victorian
works
of
art
which
however
much
esteemed
by
the
many
are
no
more
matter
for
criticism
than
a
pair
of
boots
yet
there
is
a
paper
in
in
in
which
mr
james
talks
of
the
numbers
of
sorts
of
distinction
the
educated
insight
the
comprehensive
ardour
of
mrs
humphry
ward
it
recalls
that
the
art
which
he
privately
cultivated
was
courtesy
but
it
suggests
that
his
criticism
was
bound
to
consist
for
the
most
part
of
just
such
pleasant
footnotes
to
the
obvious
as
which
with
the
exception
of
some
interesting
personal
recollections
of
turgeniev
tell
us
nothing
more
startling
than
that
de
maupassant
wrote
a
hard
prose
and
that
daudet
was
a
provençal
how
greatly
he
needed
the
intellectual
basis
which
he
found
in
none
of
these
researches
becomes
increasingly
plain
in
each
novel
that
he
published
during
this
period
portrait
of
a
is
given
a
superficial
unity
by
the
beauty
of
its
heroine
on
the
first
reading
one
can
not
take
one
eyes
off
the
clear
gaze
that
isabel
archer
levels
at
life
as
she
moves
forward
to
meet
the
world
holding
her
fortune
in
hand
without
avarice
yet
very
carefully
lest
she
should
buy
anything
gross
with
it
one
thinks
that
there
never
was
a
heroine
who
deserved
better
of
life
she
spent
half
her
time
in
thinking
of
beauty
and
bravery
and
magnanimity
she
had
a
fixed
determination
to
regard
the
world
as
a
place
of
brightness
of
free
expansion
of
irresistible
action
she
thought
it
would
be
detestable
to
be
afraid
or
ashamed
she
had
an
infinite
hope
that
she
would
never
do
anything
wrong
one
is
glad
to
see
that
the
girl
has
the
most
wonderful
friend
a
woman
who
is
at
once
the
most
flexible
du
and
the
freshest
and
most
candid
soul
and
among
the
kindnesses
this
friend
does
her
is
her
introduction
to
a
certain
tuscan
villa
that
looks
down
on
the
valley
of
the
arno
where
on
a
mossy
stone
bench
tangled
with
wild
roses
there
sits
gilbert
osmond
a
gentleman
of
great
dignity
who
has
been
too
fine
to
partake
in
the
common
struggle
and
so
lives
in
honest
poverty
with
his
daughter
pansy
a
little
girl
from
whose
character
conventual
training
has
removed
every
attribute
save
whiteness
and
sweetness
so
that
she
lies
under
life
like
a
fine
cloth
on
a
sunny
here
of
all
places
in
the
world
she
is
least
likely
to
meet
the
jealousy
and
falseness
and
cruelty
which
were
the
only
things
she
feared
and
so
she
marries
osmond
in
the
happy
faith
that
henceforth
nothing
will
be
admitted
to
her
life
save
nobility
but
all
her
marriage
brings
the
girl
is
evidence
of
increasing
painfulness
that
her
friend
is
a
squalid
adventuress
who
has
preserved
her
appearance
of
freshness
as
carefully
as
a
strolling
musician
his
fiddle
in
order
that
she
might
charm
such
honest
fools
as
isabel
that
osmond
has
withdrawn
from
the
world
not
because
he
is
too
fine
for
it
but
because
he
is
a
hating
creature
and
hates
the
world
as
he
now
hates
his
wife
that
pansy
is
the
illegitimate
child
of
these
two
and
her
need
of
a
dowry
the
chief
reason
why
osmond
has
married
isabel
it
is
a
tale
which
would
draw
tears
from
a
reviewer
and
yet
the
conduct
invented
for
isabel
is
so
inconsistent
and
so
suggestive
of
the
nincompoop
and
so
clearly
proceeding
from
a
brain
whose
ethical
world
was
but
a
chaos
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
subject
the
book
to
the
white
light
of
a
second
reading
when
we
are
told
that
isabel
married
osmond
because
there
had
been
nothing
very
delicate
in
inheriting
seventy
thousand
pounds
and
she
hoped
he
might
use
her
fortune
in
a
way
that
might
make
her
think
better
of
it
and
would
rub
off
a
certain
grossness
attaching
to
the
good
luck
of
an
unexpected
inheritance
we
feel
that
this
is
mere
simpering
for
there
could
be
nothing
less
delicate
than
to
marry
a
person
for
any
reason
but
the
consciousness
of
passion
and
the
grand
climax
of
her
conduct
her
return
to
osmond
after
the
full
revelation
of
his
guilt
has
come
to
augment
her
anguish
at
his
unkindness
proves
her
not
the
very
paragon
of
ladies
but
merely
very
ladylike
if
their
marriage
was
to
be
a
reality
it
was
to
be
a
degradation
of
the
will
whose
integrity
the
whole
book
is
an
invitation
to
admire
if
it
was
to
be
a
sham
it
was
still
a
larger
concession
to
society
than
should
have
been
made
by
an
honest
woman
yet
for
all
the
poor
quality
of
the
motives
which
furnish
isabel
moral
stuffing
portrait
of
a
is
entirely
n
successful
in
giving
one
the
sense
of
having
met
somebody
far
too
radiantly
good
for
this
world
while
that
novel
reminds
one
in
the
way
it
comes
off
of
a
sum
in
which
the
right
answer
is
got
by
wrong
working
reminds
one
of
a
foolish
song
set
to
a
good
tune
in
the
way
it
fails
to
come
off
the
beauty
of
the
writing
is
so
great
that
there
are
descriptions
of
the
shabby
petticoats
of
a
pioneer
or
the
vestibule
in
a
mean
block
of
flats
that
one
would
like
to
learn
by
heart
so
that
one
might
turn
the
phrases
over
in
the
mind
when
one
wants
to
hear
the
clinking
of
pure
gold
and
the
theme
the
aptness
of
young
persons
possessed
of
that
capacity
for
contagious
enthusiasm
which
makes
the
good
propagandist
to
be
exploited
by
the
mercenary
and
to
deteriorate
under
the
strain
of
public
life
is
specially
interesting
to
our
generation
few
of
us
there
are
who
have
not
seen
with
our
own
eyes
elderly
egoists
building
up
profitable
autocracies
out
of
the
ardour
of
young
girls
or
fierce
advocates
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
mellowing
into
contemplative
emptiers
of
but
just
as
the
most
intellectual
conversation
may
be
broken
up
by
the
continued
squeal
of
a
loose
so
this
musical
disclosure
of
fine
material
is
interrupted
past
any
reader
patience
by
a
nagging
hostility
to
political
effort
this
is
not
so
disgraceful
to
mr
james
as
it
might
seem
for
it
is
simply
the
survival
of
an
affectation
which
was
forced
upon
the
cultured
american
of
his
youth
the
pioneers
who
wanted
to
raise
the
small
silvery
song
of
art
had
to
tempt
their
audiences
somehow
from
the
big
brass
band
of
america
political
movements
and
so
straining
was
this
task
that
even
emerson
who
vibrated
to
the
chord
of
reform
as
to
no
other
was
sometimes
vexed
into
such
foolish
inquiries
as
does
he
not
do
more
to
abolish
slavery
who
works
all
day
in
his
own
garden
than
he
who
goes
to
the
abolition
meetings
and
makes
a
speech
it
was
just
one
of
the
results
of
mr
james
condition
at
this
period
that
he
presented
to
the
world
so
deliberately
and
so
vividly
and
with
such
an
air
of
feeling
what
was
no
more
than
the
misty
reflection
of
some
dead
men
transitory
irritations
politics
play
a
very
great
part
and
in
the
same
sense
in
princess
but
it
is
the
peculiar
magic
of
that
strange
book
which
is
at
once
able
and
distraught
wild
and
meticulous
that
in
it
all
perversities
are
somehow
transmuted
into
loveliness
it
is
one
of
the
big
jokes
in
literature
that
it
was
the
writer
who
among
all
his
contemporaries
held
the
most
sophisticated
view
of
his
art
who
prided
himself
that
on
him
there
gleamed
no
drop
of
the
dew
of
naïvetê
that
brought
back
to
fiction
the
last
delicious
breath
of
the
time
when
even
the
best
books
ran
on
like
this
it
happened
that
one
dark
and
stormy
night
in
march
i
sebastian
melmoth
was
traversing
the
plain
of
la
mancha
at
you
cried
the
guard
yourself
said
the
stranger
signing
to
his
hindu
attendant
that
the
bodies
should
be
removed
and
commencing
to
cleanse
the
blood
from
his
sword
with
a
richly
embroidered
handkerchief
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
my
life
there
is
always
something
doing
in
princess
and
it
is
usually
something
great
and
as
a
rule
it
is
doing
it
quite
on
its
own
as
a
portal
to
the
disordered
tale
there
stands
one
of
the
finest
short
stories
in
the
world
how
miss
pynsent
the
shabby
little
dressmaker
who
has
brought
up
hyacinth
the
bastard
child
of
a
french
now
in
millbank
for
the
murder
of
the
peer
who
betrayed
her
is
suddenly
bidden
to
bring
the
boy
to
his
mother
prison
deathbed
and
how
the
poor
woman
drags
him
up
to
the
brown
windowless
walls
the
vast
blank
gate
the
looming
corridors
infused
with
sallow
light
is
such
a
study
of
the
way
the
institutions
devised
by
man
in
the
interests
of
justice
and
order
make
a
child
soul
scream
that
the
reader
will
for
ever
after
think
a
great
deal
less
of
pip
adventures
on
the
marshes
in
dickens
could
never
have
suffused
his
story
with
so
exquisite
and
so
relevant
an
emotional
effect
as
the
aching
of
poor
miss
pynsent
heart
over
this
rough
introduction
of
her
cherished
lamb
to
the
horrible
nor
could
he
have
invented
that
wonderful
moment
when
the
child
turns
from
the
ravenous
embrace
of
the
wasted
and
disfigured
stranger
with
i
wo
kiss
her
pinnie
says
she
stole
a
watch
at
which
the
murderess
screams
quelle
infamie
i
never
stole
anything
and
the
wardress
says
with
dignity
i
sure
you
need
put
more
on
her
than
she
has
by
rights
to
which
the
poor
virgin
quite
unable
to
understand
the
peculiar
cachet
attaching
to
a
cries
contritely
mercy
more
i
thought
it
so
much
less
and
from
this
portal
the
book
goes
on
to
incidents
and
persons
not
less
exquisite
but
still
disconcertingly
mere
portals
it
is
as
though
in
a
mad
dream
one
found
oneself
passing
through
the
arch
in
the
mellow
redness
of
hampton
court
and
straightway
emerged
on
the
colonnade
of
st
paul
through
whose
little
one
surprisingly
stepped
to
the
prim
front
of
kensington
palace
there
is
poupin
the
exiled
communist
who
can
not
communicate
with
the
world
or
the
moustached
female
companion
with
whom
he
dwells
in
a
scrupulously
unmarried
state
save
by
platitudes
concerning
the
social
organisation
i
suffering
extremely
but
we
must
all
suffer
so
long
as
the
social
question
is
so
abominably
so
iniquitously
neglected
is
his
way
of
intimating
a
sore
throat
there
is
poor
lady
aurora
langrish
the
aristocratic
precursor
of
the
sad
miss
huxtables
in
madras
my
father
is
rich
and
there
only
one
of
us
eva
married
and
we
not
at
all
handsome
they
go
into
the
country
all
the
autumn
all
the
winter
when
there
no
one
here
except
three
or
four
millions
and
the
rain
drips
drips
drips
from
the
trees
in
the
big
dull
park
where
my
people
live
and
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
out
with
three
or
four
others
in
mackintoshes
there
is
dry
old
mr
vetch
who
plays
the
fiddle
in
the
orchestra
at
night
and
fills
all
the
rest
of
the
empty
day
with
love
for
hyacinth
and
there
is
captain
sholto
the
piccadilly
swell
and
miss
hennings
the
and
admirable
others
casually
affixed
by
the
stretched
string
of
circumstance
or
the
glue
of
coincidence
and
quite
the
preciousest
piece
in
the
collection
is
the
account
of
how
the
princess
casamassima
who
is
christina
light
of
grown
to
perilous
maturity
of
beauty
and
perversity
calls
young
hyacinth
to
her
country
house
and
there
in
the
beechy
park
and
flowery
lanes
makes
him
talk
of
the
plots
against
the
rich
which
later
are
to
cause
his
death
and
brings
him
nearer
to
it
by
lifting
a
face
wonderfully
pale
and
pure
with
enthusiasm
it
is
so
like
that
titian
in
the
prado
which
shows
against
a
window
looking
on
a
park
where
lovers
walk
in
golden
air
under
silver
poplars
venus
lying
on
a
satin
couch
while
a
young
man
makes
music
for
her
at
an
organ
her
eyes
are
softly
intent
and
the
youth
thinks
she
is
suspended
over
the
world
in
his
music
but
really
she
is
brooding
on
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
beneath
his
black
beard
that
likeness
suggests
that
princess
should
be
taken
not
as
a
novel
but
as
the
small
fine
picture
gallery
that
mr
james
thought
fit
to
add
to
his
mental
palace
already
so
rich
in
mere
sane
living
rooms
it
is
unpleasant
to
travel
in
a
runaway
even
if
it
ultimately
spills
one
into
a
and
when
mr
james
produced
a
picture
gallery
when
he
had
intended
a
grave
study
of
social
differences
he
was
in
much
that
case
but
already
in
author
of
he
had
shown
his
awareness
of
a
movement
which
had
started
with
the
intention
of
destroying
both
christian
morality
and
rationalism
and
otherwise
making
us
fearfully
gay
and
which
actually
achieved
the
slight
mitigation
of
the
offensiveness
of
plumbers
shop
windows
and
the
recovery
by
mr
henry
james
of
control
over
his
machine
that
story
is
not
one
of
mr
james
best
the
author
makes
his
readers
regard
his
scene
through
so
small
a
peephole
that
even
the
characters
who
are
to
be
conceived
as
above
all
retiring
have
to
come
grossly
near
if
their
audience
is
to
make
anything
of
the
drama
at
all
the
theme
is
that
an
author
wife
who
considers
her
husband
books
objectionable
lets
her
child
die
rather
than
that
he
should
grow
up
in
the
companionship
of
one
so
utterly
without
reserve
yet
since
the
tale
is
told
by
a
total
stranger
who
is
visiting
them
for
the
she
has
necessarily
to
behave
with
a
lack
of
reserve
that
makes
her
imputed
motive
incredible
the
special
value
of
the
story
lies
in
the
moments
when
the
author
of
whose
affectation
of
a
velveteen
coat
and
a
remote
foreign
air
makes
us
desire
to
scream
out
to
the
weekend
visitor
that
he
is
being
fooled
and
this
is
no
writer
but
an
artistic
photographer
remarks
with
some
complacency
that
to
the
conventional
he
appears
no
better
than
an
ancient
greek
and
professes
a
thirst
for
the
cultivation
of
beauty
without
reserve
or
precautions
our
happy
generation
can
not
understand
these
phrases
which
doubtless
had
their
salutary
meaning
for
that
distant
day
when
england
fed
herself
on
so
low
a
diet
that
the
seemed
to
her
a
maddening
draught
but
they
interest
us
by
showing
that
even
mr
james
who
ordinarily
turned
aside
with
so
chill
a
wince
from
the
ridiculous
had
exposed
his
consciousness
to
the
æsthetic
movement
which
had
been
remotely
engendered
by
leigh
hunt
cockney
crow
of
joy
at
italy
and
afterwards
fostered
by
ruskin
as
one
of
his
wild
repartees
to
the
railway
train
and
which
was
then
being
given
the
touch
by
oscar
wilde
we
feel
surprised
at
mr
james
cognisance
of
anything
so
as
this
decadent
movement
of
the
late
eighties
and
early
nineties
because
most
of
us
basely
judge
it
by
its
lack
of
worldly
success
instead
of
by
its
moral
mission
the
elect
of
the
movement
if
one
delves
in
the
memory
of
older
londoners
were
certainly
silly
young
men
who
were
careful
about
the
laundering
of
their
evening
shirts
and
who
tried
to
introduce
the
tone
of
life
into
ordinary
society
and
it
is
true
that
for
all
their
talk
of
art
they
produced
nothing
but
one
good
farce
and
a
cartload
of
such
weak
sweet
verse
as
schoolgirls
copy
into
and
that
from
this
small
effort
they
sank
exhausted
down
to
prison
drink
madness
suicide
and
struck
whatever
other
notes
there
be
in
the
descending
scale
of
personal
disgrace
and
yet
for
all
its
fruitlessness
that
prattle
about
art
gave
them
a
valid
claim
on
our
respect
never
had
beauty
been
so
forgotten
style
was
poisoned
at
the
fount
of
thought
by
carlyle
whose
sentences
were
confused
disasters
like
railway
accidents
and
by
herbert
spencer
who
wrote
as
though
he
were
the
offspring
of
two
leaders
among
novelists
only
robert
louis
stevenson
loved
words
and
he
had
too
prudent
a
care
to
water
down
his
gruel
to
suit
sick
england
stomach
and
in
criticism
andrew
lang
who
had
admired
scott
and
dickens
in
his
schooldays
and
was
not
going
to
let
himself
down
by
admiring
anybody
nearer
his
own
generation
greeted
every
exponent
of
the
real
with
a
high
piercing
northern
sneer
it
was
of
inestimable
value
that
it
should
be
cried

matter
in
how
pert
a
voice
that
words
are
jewels
which
wisely
set
make
by
their
shining
mental
light

cry

young

out

contention

the

for
it
if
they
seeking
new
beauty
could
but
celebrate
the
old
dingy
sins
of
towns

showed
in
what
a
base
age
they
had
been
bred
and
if
they
could
not
save
themselves
they
saved
others
arnold

off
in
the
nineties
in
a
world
encouragingly
full
of
talk
about
good
writing
conrad
mouthing
his
difficult
strange
tales
about
the
sea
found
an
audience
that
would
sit
hushed
and
in
the
brain
of
one
who
being
then
between
forty
and
fifty
years
of
age
might
have
been
thought
inaccessible
to
new
conceptions
of
the
art
that
had
for
so
long
preoccupied
him
there
passed
important
thoughts
that
idea
i
picked
up
when
i
corrected
george
eliot
proofs
oh
so
long
ago
one
can
imagine
mr
james
saying
that
idea
that
art
must
be
ballasted
by
didacticism
ca
be
true
for
me
i
fined
it
down
in
my
reading
of
the
french
to
an
opinion
that
the
artist
should
use
his
fancy
work
to
decorate
useful
articles
but
still
it
is
true
for
me
for
i
must
before
i
can
decorate
them
make
the
useful
articles
of
thought
my
own
and
they
are
just
the
one
thing
that
for
all
my
mental
wealth
i
ca
acquire
i
see
them
often
enough
in
the
the
moral
and
political
and
philosophical
problems
so
prodigiously
produced
by
my
age
and
many
times
have
tried
the
door
but
to
my
touch
it
never
opens
so
i
have
to
describe
them
as
i
see
them
through
the
glass
without
having
felt
or
known
them
with
the
intimacy
of
possession
true
i
did
once
deal
with
a
situation
in
the
history
of
two
peoples
but
i
see
now
that
in
its
international
character
there
was
an
intimation
that
it
was
the
last
with
which
i
should
ever
effectively
concern
myself
for
i
destructively
not
national
my
mind
is
engraved
with
the
sights
and
social
customs
of
countries
and
with
the
deep
traditions
of
not
one
and
how
can
i
deal
deeply
with
the
conduct
of
a
people
when
i
have
a
notion
of
the
quality
or
quantity
of
the
traditions
which
are
after
all
its
mainspring
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cry
of
art
for
art
sake
which
is
being
raised
by
those
young
men
and
which
certainly
is
true
for
may
be
true
for
what
if
henceforth
i
release
the
winged
steed
of
my
recording
art
from
the
obligation
of
dragging
up
the
steep
hill
of
my
inaptitude
the
dray
filled
with
the
heavy
goods
which
i
have
amassed
in
my
perhaps
so
mistaken
desire
for
a
respectably
weighty
subject
and
let
the
poor
thing
just
beautifully
soar
one
perceives
how
far
this
mood
had
gone
with
mr
james
when
the
hero
of
tragic
refuses
a
seat
in
parliament
and
the
hand
of
a
wealthy
widow
in
order
that
he
might
go
on
painting
from
mr
james
to
whom
marrying
a
widow
appeared
as
much
superior
to
marrying
a
spinster
as
privately
acquiring
a
piece
from
the
dispersed
collection
of
a
deceased
connoisseur
of
repute
is
to
buying
old
furniture
with
no
guarantee
but
one
own
approval
this
was
a
portentous
incident
and
there
is
vast
significance
in
his
sympathetic
representation
of
miriam
rooth
the
young
actress
to
whom
the
title
refers
for
before
this
period
he
would
never
have
accepted
the
genius
of
the
untidy
girl
as
an
excuse
for
her
lack
of
money
and
social
position
and
manners
it
had
hitherto
been
his
grimly
expressed
opinion
that
the
life
of
a
woman
is
essentially
an
affair
of
private
relations
and
he
had
refused
to
dramatise
in
his
imagination
anything
concerning
women
save
their
failures
and
successes
as
sexual
beings
which
is
like
judging
a
cutlet
not
by
its
flavour
but
by
the
condition
of
its
frill
that
time
had
gone
he
had
abandoned
all
his
prejudices
in
despair
and
for
many
years
to
come
was
to
show
a
divine
charity
freely
permitting
every
encountered
thing
to
impress
its
essence
on
the
receptive
wax
of
his
consciousness
for
the
next
twelve
years
impressions
as
in
his
happy
foreign
childhood
were
not
merely
all
right
but
were
the
dearest
things
in
the
world
iv
the
crystal
bowl
in
that
octagonal
room
at
the
prado
where
each
wall
is
an
altar
raised
to
beauty
because
it
is
hung
with
pictures
by
velasquez
in
all
the
lesser
works
one
finds
some
intimation
of
the
grave
fine
personality
who
produced
all
this
wonder
at
the
sacred
picture
that
was
his
first
one
says
he
was
a
pupil
and
very
proud
of
painting
the
old
things
better
than
the
old
men
could
even
though
they
meant
nothing
to
him
at
the
squat
black
dwarfs
he
was
so
sure
that
the
truth
about
the
world
was
kind
that
he
could
look
upon
horror
without
fear
and
at
the
sketches
of
the
villa
medici
gardens
after
hot
bleak
spain
he
loved
italy
as
one
who
has
known
passion
loves
a
passionless
girl
and
the
recreated
personality
tangible
enough
to
be
liked
passes
with
one
about
the
gallery
until
suddenly
before
the
masterpieces
it
vanishes
with
those
it
had
nothing
to
do
the
thing
that
was
his
character
shaped
out
of
the
innate
traits
of
his
dark
stock
by
the
raw
beauty
of
the
land
and
the
stiff
rich
life
of
the
court
brought
him
to
the
conception
of
these
works
but
lay
sleeping
through
their
execution
when
he
was
painting
he
knew
nothing
save
that
the
flesh
glowed
golden
in
the
dusty
sunlight
of
the
factory
for
the
state
of
genius
consists
of
an
utter
surrender
of
the
mind
to
the
subject
the
artist
at
the
moment
of
creation
must
be
like
a
saint
awaiting
the
embrace
of
god
scourging
appetite
out
of
him
shrinking
from
sensation
as
though
it
were
a
sin
deleting
self
lifting
his
consciousness
like
an
empty
cup
to
receive
the
heavenly
draught
and
so
with
the
beginning
of
his
second
period
of
genius
the
reading
of
mr
james
ceased
to
give
us
the
companionship
of
the
gentle
very
pleasant
american
who
seemed
homeless
but
quite
serene
as
though
he
were
tired
of
living
in
his
boxes
but
on
the
other
hand
was
very
fond
of
travelling
that
we
had
grown
to
like
in
his
books
of
the
eighties
he
went
away
and
sent
no
letter
but
instead
with
a
lavishness
one
would
never
have
suspected
from
his
uneasy
bearing
sent
a
succession
of
jewels
great
globed
jewels
of
experience
from
which
marvellously
conceived
characters
gave
out
their
milky
gleams
or
fiery
rays
the
first
tentative
try
at
the
mere
impression
aspern
gave
an
earnest
of
his
generosity
there
one
passes
into
the
golden
glow
of
venice
where
the
sky
and
the
sea
and
the
rosy
air
and
the
marble
of
the
palaces
all
shimmer
and
melt
together
the
gondola
stopped
the
old
palace
was
there
how
charming
it
grey
and
pink
and
under
the
painted
ceiling
of
the
old
palace
sits
bleached
and
shrivelled
juliana
bordereau
the
memory
of
her
love
affair
with
the
great
poet
aspern
hanging
in
the
air
like
incense
and
filling
the
mind
with
tears
that
such
splendid
lovers
buy
no
immortality
but
grow
old
like
the
rest
above
its
mere
amusing
story
the
tale
breathes
an
elegy
on
the
many
good
things
that
are
slain
by
age
before
death
comes
and
decently
inters
the
body
for
one
watches
with
a
kind
of
comic
horror
that
such
grimaces
should
touch
the
face
that
jeffery
aspern
kissed
the
grin
of
senile
irony
with
which
she
meets
the
young
american
who
comes
to
wheedle
her
lover
letters
out
of
her
with
which
she
wheedles
money
out
of
him
that
she
may
provide
for
the
future
of
the
poor
spinster
niece
who
moves
tremulously
about
her
chair
like
a
silly
baaing
sheep
with
which
one
thinks
she
possibly
anticipates
the
dreadful
moment
after
her
death
when
the
spinster
dodderingly
informs
the
american
that
she
could
give
him
her
aunt
papers
only
if
you
were
a
relation
if
you
were
a
stranger
every
drop
of
beauty
is
squeezed
out
of
the
material
by
a
pressure
so
cool
and
controlled
that
remembering
how
benvenuto
cellini
fell
in
his
clothes
and
slept
after
he
had
taken
similar
small
masterpieces
from
the
furnace
one
waits
for
his
exhaustion
but
it
was
given
to
mr
james
perhaps
because
he
was
an
american
and
so
of
a
stock
oxygenated
by
contact
with
the
free
airs
of
the
new
free
lands
to
swim
longer
in
the
sea
of
perfection
than
any
other
writer
it
was
not
until
fifteen
years
later
when
he
was
old
and
the
disciples
of
the
movement
which
had
stimulated
him
all
shabbily
dead
and
talk
about
art
locked
away
in
a
dusty
cupboard
with
the
japanese
fans
and
the
blue
china
pots
that
he
turned
tired
and
came
to
shore
he
was
sustained
in
this
long
swim
by
two
beloved
subjects
one
bitter
and
one
sweet
the
literary
life
was
written
about
in
those
days
almost
as
much
as
it
was
talked
about
and
it
was
continually
being
used
by
the
young
decadents
as
the
occasion
for
predictions
of
their
own
later
squalor
in
which
morphia
and
dark
ladies
moulded
in
the
likeness
of
beautiful
young
mrs
patrick
campbell
played
parts
which
in
the
subsequent
realisation
were
taken
by
plain
beer
and
plainer
barmaids
mr
james
took
up
the
poor
thing
and
turned
it
over
very
reverently
none
knowing
better
than
he
that
the
artist
was
the
of
his
time
and
very
sadly
because
he
had
now
close
on
thirty
years
of
intimacy
with
artists
behind
him
he
had
known
turgeniev
the
most
beautiful
genius
of
his
age
and
had
found
him
rather
lonely
and
not
eminent
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
he
had
seen
the
dark
days
of
rossetti
he
had
trod
so
close
on
the
heels
of
alfred
de
musset
as
to
know
that
trop
de
he
had
seen
poor
fat
little
zola
who
thought
that
though
one
could
not
build
rome
in
a
day
one
could
describe
it
in
less
plodding
and
sweating
up
the
wrong
road
to
art
and
so
in
a
mood
of
clear
melancholy
with
an
occasional
flash
of
irony
which
was
doubtless
the
sole
comment
wrung
from
his
urbanity
by
the
fact
that
that
age
when
the
change
of
the
novel
price
from
and
sixpence
to
six
shillings
had
enormously
increased
the
reading
public
had
brought
no
enlargement
of
his
circle
of
readers
he
wrote
that
wonderful
series
of
stories
which
began
with
lesson
of
the
and
included
middle
next
and
death
of
the
save
for
that
roaring
joke

where
one
sees
frank

free
rearrangement
of

charming
and
sponging
on
the
rich
bringing
into
their
a
swaying
body
that
should
be
taken
home
at
once
in
a
cab
and
a
mind
like
a
crystal
suspended
in
the
moral
world
swinging
and
shining
and
flashing
there
these
are
all
sad
stories
the

and

goes
astray
downstairs
somewhere
between
lord
dorimont
man
and
lady
augusta
maid
one
knows
next
to
nothing
at
all
about
the
faith
consciously
rejected
or
adopted
by
henry
james
and
whether
the
atmosphere
of
speculative
theology
in
which
he
was
bred
had
made
him
think
religion
as
far
beyond
his
mental
range
as
mathematics
or
whether
christianity
seemed
to
him
just
the
excuse
of
the
latin
races
for
building
high
cool
places
very
grateful
in
the
heat
and
filling
them
with
incense
and
images
of
kind
interceding
people
but
in
this
melancholy
series
and
indeed
in
all
his
later
works
for
right
on
to
golden
he
presents
his
characters
as
being
worthy
of
treatment
just
because
they
are
in
some
way
or
other
struggling
to
preserve
some
decency
from
engulfment
in
the
common
lot
of
nastiness
one
perceives
that
he
had
been
born
with
the
grim
new
england
faith
like
a
cold
drop
in
his
blood
the
earth
was
a
vale
of
tears
and
all
one
could
do
was
to
go
on
uninfluenced
by
weeping
or
the
fear
of
weeping
to
some
high
goal
this
sad
belief
accompanied
by
so
intense
a
consciousness
that
his
particular
goal
the
art
of
great
writing
was
reached
by
a
stonier
and
longer
path
than
any
might
have
been
expected
to
provoke
him
rather
to
the
fury
of
landor
or
the
gloomy
pomposity
of
wordsworth
than
to
the
unhurried
unimpassioned
production
of
these
wonderful
stories
these
exquisite
vessels
that
swaggeringly
hold
and
clearly
show
the
contained
draught
of
truth
like
goblets
of
venetian
glass
but
glass
is
the
wrong
image
for
no
hand
could
ever
break
these
no
critical
eye
detect
a
crack
they
are
so
truthfully
conceived
that
one
could
compare
them
only
to
some
nobly
infrangible
substance
so
realistic
and
yet
so
charged
with
significance
by
their
fashioning
that
their
likeness
must
be
something
which
is
transparent
and
yet
gives
the
light
a
white
fire
as
it
passed
through
it
is
of

are

fallen

also
showed
him
a
son
of

for
it
consists
of
nothing
else
than
the
demonstration
in
varying
and
exquisitely
selected
circumstances
that
blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
and
that
was
certainly
the
beatitude
that
new
england
with
its
fear
of
passion
and
publicity
and
its
respect
for
spinsters
and
pastors
of
bleached
lives
most
regarded
mr
james
demonstrated
it
in
no
spirit
of
moral
propaganda
but
for
the
technical
reason
that
a
situation
is
greatly
elucidated
if
one
of
the
persons
engaged
presents
a
consciousness
like
a
polished
silver
surface
unobscured
by
any
tracery
of
selfish
preoccupations
which
clearly
mirrors
the
other
participients
and
their
movements
perhaps
he
thereby
discovered
the
real
meaning
of
the
beatitude
which
may
be
no
more
than
an
expression
of
the
obvious
truth
that
he
who
receives
the
fullest
impression
of
the
world
is
likely
to
react
most
valuably
to
it
certainly
he
invented
a
technical
trick
which
in
its
way
was
as
important
as
the
discovery
which
ibsen
was
making
about
the
same
time
and
which
he
himself
used
later
in
his
last
masterpiece
that
if
one
had
a
really
great
scene
one
ought
to
leave
it
out
and
describe
it
simply
by
the
full
relation
of
its
consequences
he
showed
that
all
sorts
of
things
that
are
amusing
enough
to
write
about
and
are
yet
too
ignoble
for
dignified
art
are
lent
the
required
nobility
by
being
witnessed
by
grave
candour
and
that
characters
whose
special
claim
is
that
they
are
strange
but
whose
strangeness
can
not
be
laboured
by
direct
description
lest
they
become
crude
can
have
the
gaps
in
their
representation
filled
out
by
their
effect
on
the
simple
rose
armiger
in
other
is
made
much
more
horrible
because
she
exposes
her
dreadful
passion
before
the
simplicity
of
tony
bream
just
as
a
striped
poisonous
snake
would
seem
more
striped
and
poisonous
if
it
flickered
its
black
fang
from
an
english
the
awfulness
of
ida

whose
handsome
appearance
constituted
an
abuse
of

never
have

was
such
a
good
fellow
to
talk
to

dark
young

was
sweeping
into

to
the
shining
limbs
of
a

the
beautiful
genteel

have
been
a
matter
too
for

if

the
more
ghostly
because
the
apparitions
of

the
governess
appearing
at
the
dangerous
place
the
top
of

on
the

that
they
may
tempt
the
children
they
corrupted
in

lives
to
join
them
in

eternal
torment

seen
by
the
clear
eyes
of
the
honourable
and
fearless
lady
who
tells
the
tale
and
the
has
no
subject
but
the
purity
of
the
romantic
little
telegraphist
who
sits
behind
the
wire
netting
at
the
grocer
her
heart
is
like
a
well
of

water

love
strikes
down
like
a
shaft
of
light
one
pauses
horrified
to
find
oneself
ticking
off
these
masterpieces
on
one
fingers
as
though
they
were
so
many
books
by
mrs
humphry
ward
or
buns
by
lyons
and
yet
what
can
one
do
criticism
must
break
down
when
it
comes
to
masterpieces
for
if
one
is
creative
one
wants
to
go
away
and
spend
oneself
utterly
on
this
sacred
business
of
creation
wring
out
of
oneself
every
drop
of
this
inestimable
thing
art
and
if
one
is
not
creative
one
can
only
put
out
a
tremulous
finger
to
touch
the
marvellous
shining
crystal
and
be
silent
with
wonder
deep
wonder
since
these
are
not
as
fools
have
pretended
merely
rich
treatments
of
the
trivial
for
although
he
could
not
grasp
a
complicated
abstraction
was
teased
by
the
implications
of
a
great
cause
and
angered
by
an
idea
that
could
be
understood
only
by
the
synthesis
of
many
references
he
could
dive
down
serenely
like
a
practised
diver
going
under
the
sea
for
pearls
into
the
twilit
depths
of
the
heart
to
seize
his
secrets
there
is
in
humanity
an
instinct
for
ritual
there
lies
in
all
of
us
a
desire
to
commemorate
our
deep
emotions
that
would
otherwise
glow
in
our
bosoms
and
die
down
for
ever
by
some
form
that
adds
to
the
beauty
of
the
world
but
there
is
only
one
expression
of
it
in
literature
that
is
not
poisonously
silly
newman
and
the
tractarians
and
monsignor
benson
make
the
ritualist
seem
as
big
a
fool
as
the
old
woman
who
carries
a
potato
in
her
pocket
to
ward
off
rheumatism
sabatier
makes
him
seem
the
kind
of
person
who
takes
sugar
in
his
tea
paints
in
and
likes
but
there
is
a
story
by
henry
james
called
altar
of
the
rejected
again
and
again
by
the
caste
of
cretins
who
edit
the
magazines
and
reviews
of
this
unhappy
country
although
of
so
perfect
a
beauty
that
one
can
read
every
separate
paragraph
every
day
of
one
life
for
the
music
of
the
sentences
and
the
loveliness
of
the
presented
images
which
takes
ritual
from
the
trembling
hands
of
the
coped
old
men
and
exhibits
it
as
something
that
those
who
love
the
natural
frame
of
things
and
hate
superstition
need
not
fear
to
accept
it
tells
how
an
ageing
man
acquires
an
altar
in
a
roman
catholic
church
and
burns
at
it
candles
to
his
many
dead
and
by
worshipping
there
keeps
so
close
company
with
their
charity
and
sweetness
that
at
his
end
the
blaze
of
white
lights
inspires
him
to
a
last
supreme
act
of
forgiveness
to
an
enemy
and
the
beautiful
recital
makes
one
mind
no
longer
fear
to
admit
that
the
splendour
of
a
cathedral
mass
may
although
unbelief
fly
like
an
arrow
through
the
show
and
transfix
even
the
cross
itself
fulfil
a
noble
need
once
at
least
henry
james
poured
into
his
crystal
goblet
the
red
wine
that
nourishes
the
soul
and
it
held
too
a
liberal
draught
of
the
least
trivial
distillation
of
man
mind
which
is
tragedy
in
wings
of
the
that
story
is
the
perfect
example
of
what
he
had
declared
in
tragic
the
artistic
performance
should
always
be
the
application
clear
and
calculated
as
it
were
of
the
idea
conceived
in
the
glow
of
experience
of
suffering
of
joy
for
milly
theale
the
american
heiress
who
had
arts
and
idiosyncrasies
of
which
no
great
account
could
have
been
given
but
which
were
a
daily
grace
if
you
lived
with
them
such
as
the
art
of
being
almost
tragically
impatient
and
yet
making
it
light
as
air
of
being
inexplicably
sad
and
yet
making
it
clear
as
noon
of
being
unmistakably
sad
and
yet
making
it
soft
as
dusk
whose
hopeful
progress
through
europe
stops
suddenly
at
the
dark
portal
in
harley
street
is
but
the
ghost
of
mary
temple
whose
death
thirty
years
before
had
been
felt
by
henry
and
william
james
as
the
end
of
their
youth
all
those
years
he
had
held
in
his
heart
the
memory
of
that
poor
girl
conscious
of
a
great
capacity
for
life
but
early
stricken
and
doomed
condemned
to
die
under
short
respite
while
also
enamoured
of
the
world
aware
moreover
of
the
condemnation
and
passionately
desiring
to
in
before
extinction
as
many
of
the
finer
vibrations
as
possible
and
so
achieve
however
briefly
and
brokenly
the
sense
of
having
lived
but
with
the
prescience
of
the
artist
he
had
delayed
until
he
had
perfected
his
art
to
undertake
the
heavy
task
of
presenting
her
tragedy
without
mitigation
and
yet
making
it
bearable
and
beautiful
then
he
lavished
his
technical
resources
on
her
history
as
he
might
have
laid
flowers
on
her
grave
there
is
nothing
more
miraculous
in
all
his
works
than
the
way
he
contrives
that
when
her
agony
becomes
too
great
to
be
directly
represented
and
has
to
be
suggested
by
its
effect
upon
others
he
yet
breaks
no
link
of
the
intimacy
between
the
reader
and
his
heroine
but
provides
that
her
increasing
physical
absence
shall
be
so
compensated
for
by
her
spiritual
presence
that
her
rare
appearances
are
like
visits
from
a
distant
friend
one
knowledge
of
her
glows
into
love
when
one
sees
her
holding
a
reception
in
the
faded
golden
splendours
of
the
venetian
palace
to
which
she
has
dragged
herself
to
die
smiling
bravely
at
her
guests
bidding
musicians
strike
up
to
keep
them
gay
playing
to
preserve
her
hands
from
any
gesture
of
anguish
or
appearance
of
lassitude
with
the
rope
of
pearls
that
seems
to
weigh
down
her
wasted
body
yet
one
gets
vision
through
the
hard
envious
eyes
of
kate
croy
who
is
the
hawk
circling
over
the
poor
dying
dove
and
the
appalled
gaze
of
merton
densher
kate
secret
lover
whom
she
has
trapped
into
a
profession
of
love
for
milly
so
that
the
deluded
girl
will
leave
him
her
fortune
and
one
sees
her
most
radiantly
of
all
in
the
interview
which
she
grants
to
densher
when
she
has
discovered
the
cruel
fraud
practised
on
her
and
is
dying
of
the
knowledge
although
one
is
told
no
more
than
that
she
received
me
just
as
usual
in
that
glorious
great
in
the
dress
she
always
wears
from
her
inveterate
corner
of
her
sofa
from
the
love
it
lit
in
his
heart
a
love
so
great
that
for
very
shame
kate
can
not
marry
him
even
when
her
machinations
have
achieved
complete
success
at
milly
death
one
perceives
that
this
was
the
dying
girl
assumption
that
her
sweetness
and
strength
must
at
that
hour
have
flowered
so
divinely
that
the
skies
opened
and
they
were
no
longer
matter
for
a
human
history
but
about
this
masterpiece
too
there
can
be
nothing
said
one
just
sits
and
looks
up
while
the
master
lifts
his
old
grief
changed
by
his
craftsmanship
into
eternal
beauty
as
the
wafer
is
changed
to
the
host
by
the
priest
liturgy
enclosed
from
decay
prisoned
in
perfection
in
the
great
shining
crystal
bowl
of
his
art
v
the
golden
bowl
the
signs
of
age
appeared
in
mr
james
work
like
white
streaks
in
a
black
beard
between
two
vital
and
vigorous
books
there
would
appear
one
that
in
its
garrulity
and
complacent
surrender
to
mannerism
predicted
decay
it
became
clear
first
of
all
that
he
was
no
longer
able
to
bear
up
with
serenity
under
his
deep
sense
that
life
was
a
vale
of
tears
how
much
he
wished
it
would
all
stop
is
manifest
in
that
strangest
of
all
visions
of
paradise
great
good
we
all
have
our
hopes
of
what
gifts
the
hereafter
may
bring
us
and
in
most
cases
we
desire
some
compensation
for
the
limitations
of
our
human
knowledge
we
promise
ourselves
that
when
we
lean
over
the
gold
bar
of
heaven
a
competent
angel
will
bustle
up
clasping
innumerable
divinely
clear
under
its
wings
to
tell
us
absolutely
everything
about
physics
with
special
reference
to
the
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
spinning
below
but
it
is
the
essence
of
mr
james
paradise
that
there
is
nothing
there
at
all
but
a
climate
a
sweet
soft
climate
in
which
the
most
that
happens
is
one
of
those
summer
sprinkles
that
brings
out
smells
this
fatigue
of
life
this
hunger
for
the
peace
of
nothingness
showed
itself
in
his
increasing
preference
for
laying
the
scene
of
his
novels
in
the
great
good
places
of
this
earth
where
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
in
the
parks
and
on
the
terraces
than
deer
and
peacocks
and
nothing
more
disturbing
to
the
soul
in
the
high
rooms
and
interminable
galleries
than
women
it
was
not
a
gain
to
his
art
under
its
influence
he
committed
the
twittering
over
teacups
which
compose
the
collection
of
short
stories
called
better
and
the
incidentally
beautiful
but
devastatingly
artificial
awkward
in
which
the
reader
is
perpetually
confused
because
nanda
brookenham
one
of
the
most
charming
of
mr
james
pure
in
heart
is
wept
over
as
though
she
had
been
violated
body
and
soul
when
all
that
has
happened
is
that
she
has
been
brought
up
in
a
faster
set
than
the
world
thinks
desirable
for
a
young
unmarried
girl
and
it
was
peculiarly
unfortunate
that
while
his
subjects
grew
flimsier
and
his
settings
more
impressive
his
style
became
more
and
more
elaborate
with
sentences
vast
as
the
granite
blocks
of
the
pyramids
and
a
scene
that
would
have
made
a
site
for
a
capital
he
set
about
constructing
a
story
the
size
of
a
the
type
of
these
unhappier
efforts
of
mr
james
genius
is
sacred
where
with
a
respect
for
the
mere
gross
largeness
and
expensiveness
of
the
country
house
which
almost
makes
one
write
the
author
mr
jeames
he
records
how
a
visitor
spends
more
intellectual
force
than
kant
can
have
used
on
critique
of
pure
in
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
discover
whether
there
exists
between
certain
of
his
a
relationship
not
more
interesting
among
these
vacuous
people
than
it
is
among
sparrows
the
finely
wrought
descriptions
of
the
leisured
life
make
one
feel
as
though
one
sat
in
a
beautiful
old
castle
granting
its
beauty
but
not
pleased
because
one
is
a
prisoner
while
the
small
mean
story
worries
one
like
a
rat
nibbling
at
the
wainscot
one
takes
it
as
significant
that
the
unnamed
host
and
hostess
of
the
party
never
appear
save
to
give
signals
the
tiny
desperate
figures
this
phrase
shows
to
the
eye
semaphoring
to
each
other
across
incredibly
extended
polished
vistas
to
keep
up
their
courage
under
these
looming
soaring
vaults
may
be
taken
as
symbols
of
the
heart
and
intellect
which
mr
james
had
now
forgotten
in
his
elaboration
of
their
social
envelope
but
with
this
method
as
in
every
form
of
literary
activity
save
only
playwriting
in
which
he
was
rather
worse
than
sidney
grundy
in
much
the
same
way
mr
james
gained
his
radiant
triumphs
there
could
be
nothing
more
trivial
than
the
of
there
is
no
dignity
or
significance
in
the
situation
of
lambert
strether
an
american
who
is
engaged
in
that
odd
way
common
to
mr
james
characters
to
a
woman
whom
he
certainly
does
not
love
and
hardly
seems
to
like
and
goes
at
her
bidding
to
paris
to
cut
her
cubbish
son
clear
from
an
entanglement
with
a
frenchwoman
and
yet
so
artfully
is
the
tale
displayed
in
the
setting
of
lovely
clean
white
paris
and
green
france
lifting
her
poplars
into
the
serene
strong
light
of
the
french
sky
that
the
reader
holds
his
breath
over
the
story
of
how
strether
had
come
with
a
view
that
might
have
been
figured
by
a
clear
green
liquid
say
in
a
neat
glass
phial
and
the
liquid
once
poured
into
the
open
cup
of
once
exposed
to
the
action
of
another
air
had
begun
to
turn
from
green
to
red
or
whatever
and
might
for
all
he
knew
be
on
its
way
to
purple
to
black
to
yellow
how
in
fact
the
old
international
situation
acted
on
the
new
generation
of
americans
but
that
book
is
not
typical
of
this
period
for
it
is
singularly
free
from
those
great
sentences
which
sprawl
over
the
pages
of
golden
with
such
an
effect
of
rank
vegetable
growth
that
one
feels
that
if
one
took
cuttings
of
them
one
could
raise
a
library
in
the
garden
and
it
is
those
sentences
which
absorb
at
the
last
the
whole
of
mr
attention
for
he
ceased
as
time
went
on
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
emotional
values
of
his
stories
it
is
one
of
the
strangest
things
about
golden
that
the
frame
on
which
there
hangs
the
most
elaborate
integument
of
suggestion
and
exposition
ever
woven
by
the
mind
of
man
is
an
ugly
and
incompletely
invented
story
about
some
people
who
are
sexually
mad
adam
verver
an
american
millionaire
buys
an
italian
prince
for
his
daughter
maggie
and
in
her
turn
she
arranges
a
marriage
between
her
father
and
charlotte
her
school
friend
because
she
thinks
he
may
be
lonely
without
her
and
although
it
is
plain
that
people
who
buy
marriages
are
more
awful
than
the
admittedly
awful
people
who
buy
ties
they
are
presented
to
one
as
vibrating
exquisitely
to
every
fine
chord
of
life
as
thinking
about
each
other
with
the
anxious
subtlety
of
lovers
as
so
steeped
in
a
sense
of
one
another
that
they
invent
a
sea
of
poetic
phrases
beautiful
images
discerning
metaphors
that
break
on
the
reader
mind
like
the
unceasing
surf
and
when
one
tries
to
discover
from
the
recorded
speeches
of
these
people
whether
there
was
no
palliation
of
their
ugly
circumstances
one
finds
that
the
dialogue
usually
so
compact
a
raft
for
the
conveyance
of
the
meaning
of
mr
james
novels
has
been
smashed
up
on
this
sea
of
phrases
and
drifts
in
a
plank
at
a
time
on
the
copious
flood
maggie
happened
to
learn
by
some
other
man
greeting
of
him
in
the
bright
roman
way
from
a
street
corner
as
we
passed
that
one
of
the
prince
baptismal
names
the
one
always
used
for
him
among
his
relations
was
amerigo
which
as
you
probably
do
know
however
even
after
a
lifetime
of
was
the
name
four
hundred
years
ago
or
whenever
of
the
pushing
man
who
followed
across
the
sea
in
the
wake
of
columbus
and
succeeded
where
columbus
had
failed
in
becoming
godfather
or
to
the
new
continent
so
the
thought
of
any
connection
with
him
can
even
now
thrill
our
artless
breasts
and
as
if
it
was
not
enough
that
these
people
should
say
literally
unspeakable
sentences
like
that
and
do
incredible
things
the
phrases
make
them
do
things
which
they
never
did
for
the
metaphors
are
so
beautifully
and
completely
presented
to
the
mind
that
it
retains
them
as
having
as
real
and
physical
an
existence
as
the
facts
when
we
learn
that
the
relationship
between
charlotte
and
the
prince
had
reared
itself
in
maggie
life
like
some
wonderful
beautiful
but
outlandish
pagoda
a
structure
plated
with
hard
bright
porcelain
coloured
and
figured
and
adorned
at
the
overhanging
eaves
with
silver
bells
that
tinkled
ever
so
charmingly
when
stirred
by
chance
airs
and
the
simile
is
cunningly
developed
for
seven
or
eight
hundred
words
one
is
left
with
a
confused
impression
that
a
pagoda
formed
part
of
the
furniture
at
portland
place
and
that
maggie
oddly
elected
to
keep
her
husband
inside
it
and
to
cap
it
all
these
people
are
not
even
human
for
their
thoughts
concerning
their
relationships
are
so
impassioned
and
so
elaborate
that
they
can
never
have
had
either
energy
or
time
for
the
consideration
of
anything
else
in
the
world
a
race
of
creatures
so
inveterately
specialist
as
maggie
verver
could
never
have
attained
man
mastery
over
environment
but
would
still
be
specialising
on
the
or
some
such
simple
form
of
diet
decidedly
golden
is
not
good
as
a
novel
but
what
it
is
supremely
good
as
can
be
discovered
when
one
learns
how
in
these
later
days
mr
james
used
to
compose
his
novels
he
began
by
dictating
a
short
draft
which
even
in
the
case
of
such
a
cartload
of
apes
and
ivory
as
golden
might
be
no
longer
than
thirty
thousand
words
then
he
would
take
this
draft
in
his
hand
and
would
dictate
it
all
over
again
with
what
he
intended
to
be
enlightening
additions
but
which
since
the
mere
act
of
talking
set
all
his
family
on
to
something
quite
different
from
the
art
of
letters
made
it
less
and
less
of
a
novel
for
the
james
family
had
as
was
shown
by
their
father
many
reported
phrases
by
william
james
charm
as
a
lecturer
and
by
the
social
greatness
of
robertson
james
a
genius
for
conversation
for
long
years
it
had
remained
latent
in
henry
james
who
had
in
youth
suffered
much
from
that
stockishness
which
often
comes
to
those
who
are
burning
all
their
energy
for
creative
purposes
and
have
none
left
for
personal
display
but
latterly
it
had
been
liberated
by
the
consciousness
of
maturity
and
fame
at
last
it
became
a
passion
with
him
and
he
decided
to
converse
not
only
with
his
friends
but
with
his
public
this
was
bad
for
his
novels
so
long
as
one
considered
them
as
such
since
a
novel
should
be
the
presentation
and
explanation
of
a
subject
while
a
conversation
is
a
fantasia
of
entertaining
phrases
on
themes
the
essentials
of
which
are
to
some
extent
already
in
the
possession
of
the
interlocutors
but
once
one
considers
them
as
a
flow
of
bright
things
said
about
people
mr
james
knows
and
that
one
rather
thinks
one
has
met
but
is
not
quite
sure
one
perceives
that
the
crystal
bowl
of
mr
art
was
not
as
one
had
feared
broken
he
had
but
gilded
its
clear
sides
with
the
gold
of
his
genius
for
and
now
instead
of
lifting
it
with
a
gesture
to
exhibit
a
noble
subject
held
it
on
his
knees
as
a
treasured
piece
of
and
tossed
into
it
with
an
increasing
carelessness
any
sort
of
subject
a
jewel
a
rose
a
bit
of
string
a
confident
that
the
surrounding
golden
glow
would
lend
it
beauty
indiscriminately
he
dropped
into
it
his
precious
visions
of
his
revisited
motherland
in
american
the
dry
little
anecdotes
of
finer
the
tittering
triviality
of
and
his
judgment
of
his
own
works
in
the
prefaces
to
the
new
york
edition
of
the
and
tales
of
henry
always
it
was
good
rambling
talk
although
fissured
now
and
then
with
an
old
man
lapses
into
tiresomeness
when
he
split
hairs
until
there
were
no
longer
any
hairs
to
split
and
his
mental
gesture
became
merely
the
making
of
agitated
passes
over
a
complete
baldness
and
here
and
there
the
prose
achieves
a
beauty
of
its
own
but
it
is
no
longer
the
beauty
of
a
living
thing
but
rather
the
made
beauty
which
bases
its
claims
to
admiration
chiefly
on
its
ingenuity
like
those
crystal
clocks
with
jewelled
works
and
figures
moving
as
the
hours
chimed
which
were
the
glory
of
mediæval
palaces
william
james
died
in
and
henry
james
who
had
already
begun
to
savour
the
bitterness
of
outliving
brothers
and
friends
and
pets
whiled
away
the
next
few
years
of
separation
from
his
adored
brother
in
the
composition
of
two
beautiful
books
about
their
childhood
and
youth
small
and
of
a
son
and
and
a
third
autobiographical
volume
which
is
not
yet
published
then
came
the
european
war
in
which
he
enlisted
as
a
spiritual
soldier
by
innumerable
beautiful
acts
by
kindly
visits
to
french
and
belgian
refugees
and
wounded
soldiers
by
gifts
of
money
and
writings
to
war
charities
he
raised
an
altar
to
the
dead
who
had
died
for
the
countries
which
he
had
always
loved
at
the
hands
of
the
country
which
ever
since
he
was
a
student
at
bonn
he
had
always
loathed
in
july
he
took
the
great
step
fraught
for
him
with
the
deepest
emotions
of
renouncing
his
american
citizenship
and
becoming
a
naturalised
british
subject
and
in
january
he
did
england
the
further
honour
of
accepting
the
order
of
merit
and
on
february
he
died
leaving
the
white
light
of
his
genius
to
shine
out
for
the
eternal
comfort
of
the
mind
of
man
