life
in
the
far
west
by
george
frederick
ruxton
author
of
travels
in
mexico
william
blackwood
and
sons
edinburgh
and
london
originally
published
in
blackwood
magazine
john
hughes
printer
edinburgh
the
late
george
frederick
ruxton
the
london
newspapers
of
october
contained
the
mournful
tidings
of
the
death
at
st
louis
on
the
mississippi
and
at
the
early
age
of
of
lieutenant
george
frederick
ruxton
formerly
of
her
majesty
regiment
the
author
of
the
following
sketches
many
men
even
in
the
most
enterprising
periods
of
our
history
have
been
made
the
subjects
of
elaborate
biography
with
far
less
title
to
the
honour
than
this
lamented
young
officer
time
was
not
granted
him
to
embody
in
a
permanent
shape
a
tithe
of
his
personal
experiences
and
strange
adventures
in
three
quarters
of
the
globe
considering
indeed
the
amount
of
physical
labour
he
underwent
and
the
extent
of
the
fields
over
which
his
wanderings
spread
it
is
almost
surprising
he
found
leisure
to
write
so
much
at
the
early
age
of
seventeen
mr
ruxton
quitted
sandhurst
to
learn
the
practical
part
of
a
profession
in
the
civil
wars
of
spain
he
obtained
a
commission
in
a
squadron
of
lancers
then
attached
to
the
division
of
general
diego
leon
and
was
actively
engaged
in
several
of
the
most
important
combats
of
the
campaign
for
his
marked
gallantry
on
these
occasions
he
received
from
queen
isabella
the
cross
of
the
first
class
of
the
order
of
st
fernando
an
honour
which
has
seldom
been
awarded
to
one
so
young
on
his
return
from
spain
he
found
himself
gazetted
to
a
commission
in
the
regiment
and
it
was
whilst
serving
with
that
distinguished
corps
in
canada
that
he
first
became
acquainted
with
the
stirring
scenes
of
indian
life
which
he
has
since
so
graphically
portrayed
his
eager
and
enthusiastic
spirit
soon
became
wearied
with
the
monotony
of
the
and
yielding
to
that
impulse
which
in
him
was
irresistibly
developed
he
resigned
his
commission
and
directed
his
steps
towards
the
stupendous
wilds
tenanted
only
by
the
red
indian
or
by
the
solitary
american
trapper
those
familiar
with
mr
ruxton
writings
can
not
fail
to
have
remarked
the
singular
delight
with
which
he
dwells
upon
the
recollections
of
this
portion
of
his
career
and
the
longing
which
he
carried
with
him
to
the
hour
of
his
death
for
a
return
to
those
scenes
of
primitive
freedom
although
liable
to
an
accusation
of
barbarism
he
writes
i
must
confess
that
the
very
happiest
moments
of
my
life
have
been
spent
in
the
wilderness
of
the
far
west
and
i
never
recall
but
with
pleasure
the
remembrance
of
my
solitary
camp
in
the
bayou
salade
with
no
friend
near
me
more
faithful
than
my
rifle
and
no
companions
more
sociable
than
my
good
horse
and
mules
or
the
attendant
cayute
which
nightly
serenaded
us
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
dry
on
the
fire
and
its
cheerful
blaze
streaming
far
up
into
the
sky
illuminating
the
valley
far
and
near
and
exhibiting
the
animals
with
bellies
standing
contentedly
at
rest
over
their
i
would
sit
enjoying
the
genial
warmth
and
pipe
in
mouth
watch
the
blue
smoke
as
it
curled
upwards
building
castles
in
its
vapoury
wreaths
and
in
the
fantastic
shapes
it
assumed
peopling
the
solitude
with
figures
of
those
far
away
scarcely
however
did
i
ever
wish
to
change
such
hours
of
freedom
for
all
the
luxuries
of
civilised
life
and
unnatural
and
extraordinary
as
it
may
appear
yet
such
is
the
fascination
of
the
life
of
the
mountain
hunter
that
i
believe
not
one
instance
could
be
adduced
of
even
the
most
polished
and
civilised
of
men
who
had
once
tasted
the
sweets
of
its
attendant
liberty
and
freedom
from
every
worldly
care
not
regretting
the
moment
when
he
exchanged
it
for
the
monotonous
life
of
the
settlements
nor
sighing
and
sighing
again
once
more
to
partake
of
its
pleasures
and
on
his
return
to
europe
from
the
far
west
mr
ruxton
animated
with
a
spirit
as
enterprising
and
fearless
as
that
of
raleigh
planned
a
scheme
for
the
exploration
of
central
africa
which
was
thus
characterised
by
the
president
of
the
royal
geographical
society
in
his
anniversary
address
for
to
my
great
surprise
i
recently
conversed
with
an
ardent
and
accomplished
youth
lieutenant
ruxton
late
of
the
regiment
who
had
formed
the
daring
project
of
traversing
africa
in
the
parallel
of
the
southern
tropic
and
has
actually
started
for
this
purpose
preparing
himself
by
previous
excursions
on
foot
in
north
africa
and
algeria
he
sailed
from
liverpool
early
in
december
last
in
the
royalist
for
ichaboe
from
that
spot
he
was
to
repair
to
walvish
bay
where
we
have
already
mercantile
establishments
the
intrepid
traveller
had
received
from
the
agents
of
these
establishments
such
favourable
accounts
of
the
nations
towards
the
interior
as
also
of
the
nature
of
the
climate
that
he
has
the
most
sanguine
hopes
of
being
able
to
penetrate
to
the
central
region
if
not
of
traversing
it
to
the
portuguese
colonies
of
mozambique
if
this
be
accomplished
then
indeed
will
lieutenant
ruxton
have
acquired
for
himself
a
permanent
name
among
british
travellers
by
making
us
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
axis
of
the
great
continent
of
which
we
possess
the
southern
in
pursuance
of
this
hazardous
scheme
ruxton
with
a
single
companion
landed
on
the
coast
of
africa
a
little
to
the
south
of
ichaboe
and
commenced
his
journey
of
exploration
but
it
seemed
as
if
both
nature
and
man
had
combined
to
baffle
the
execution
of
his
design
the
course
of
their
travel
lay
along
a
desert
of
moving
sand
where
no
water
was
to
be
found
and
little
herbage
save
a
coarse
tufted
grass
and
twigs
of
the
resinous
myrrh
the
immediate
place
of
their
destination
was
angra
peguena
on
the
coast
described
as
a
frequented
station
but
which
in
reality
was
deserted
one
ship
only
was
in
the
offing
when
the
travellers
arrived
and
to
their
inexpressible
mortification
they
discovered
that
she
was
outward
bound
no
trace
was
visible
of
the
river
or
streams
laid
down
in
the
maps
as
falling
into
the
sea
at
this
point
and
no
resource
was
left
to
the
travellers
save
that
of
retracing
their
labour
for
which
their
strength
was
hardly
adequate
but
for
the
opportune
assistance
of
a
body
of
natives
who
encountered
them
at
the
very
moment
when
they
were
sinking
from
fatigue
and
thirst
ruxton
and
his
companion
would
have
been
added
to
the
long
catalogue
of
those
whose
lives
have
been
sacrificed
in
the
attempt
to
explore
the
interior
of
that
fatal
country
the
jealousy
of
the
traders
and
of
the
missionaries
settled
on
the
african
coast
who
constantly
withheld
or
perverted
that
information
which
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
successful
prosecution
of
the
journey
induced
ruxton
to
abandon
the
attempt
for
the
present
he
made
however
several
interesting
excursions
towards
the
interior
and
more
especially
in
the
country
of
the
bosjesmans
finding
his
own
resources
inadequate
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
favourite
project
mr
ruxton
on
his
return
to
england
made
application
for
government
assistance
but
though
this
demand
was
not
altogether
refused
it
having
been
referred
to
the
council
of
the
royal
geographical
society
and
favourably
reported
upon
by
that
body
so
many
delays
interposed
that
ruxton
in
disgust
resolved
to
withdraw
from
the
scheme
and
to
abandon
that
field
of
african
research
which
he
had
already
contemplated
from
its
borders
he
next
bent
his
steps
to
mexico
and
fortunately
has
presented
to
the
world
his
reminiscences
of
that
country
in
one
of
the
most
fascinating
volumes
which
of
late
years
has
issued
from
the
press
it
would
however
appear
that
the
african
scheme
the
darling
project
of
his
life
had
again
recurred
to
him
at
a
later
period
for
in
the
course
of
the
present
spring
before
setting
out
on
that
journey
which
was
destined
to
be
his
last
the
following
expressions
occur
in
one
of
his
letters
my
movements
are
uncertain
for
i
am
trying
to
get
up
a
yacht
voyage
to
borneo
and
the
indian
archipelago
have
volunteered
to
government
to
explore
central
africa
and
the
aborigines
protection
society
wish
me
to
go
out
to
canada
to
organise
the
indian
tribes
whilst
for
my
own
part
and
inclination
i
wish
to
go
to
all
parts
of
the
world
at
as
regards
the
volume
to
which
this
notice
serves
as
preface
the
editor
does
not
hesitate
to
express
a
very
high
opinion
of
its
merits
written
by
a
man
untrained
to
literature
and
whose
life
from
upwards
was
passed
in
the
field
and
on
the
road
in
military
adventure
and
travel
its
style
is
yet
often
as
remarkable
for
graphic
terseness
and
vigour
as
its
substance
every
where
is
for
great
novelty
and
originality
the
narrative
of
life
in
the
far
west
was
first
offered
for
insertion
in
in
the
spring
of
when
the
greater
portion
of
the
manuscript
was
sent
and
the
remainder
shortly
followed
during
its
publication
in
that
periodical
the
wildness
of
the
adventures
related
excited
suspicions
in
certain
quarters
as
to
their
actual
truth
and
fidelity
it
may
interest
the
reader
to
know
that
the
scenes
described
are
pictures
from
life
the
results
of
the
author
personal
experience
the
following
are
extracts
from
letters
addressed
by
him
in
the
course
of
last
summer
to
the
conductors
of
the
magazine
above
named
i
have
brought
out
a
few
more
softening
traits
in
the
characters
of
the
not
at
the
sacrifice
of
some
of
them
have
their
good
points
which
as
they
are
rarely
allowed
to
rise
to
the
surface
must
be
laid
hold
of
at
once
before
they
sink
again
hos
was
really
pretty
much
of
a
gentleman
as
was
la
bonté
bill
williams
another
case
and
rube
herring
were
too
the
scene
where
la
bonté
joins
the
chase
family
is
so
far
true
that
he
did
make
a
sudden
appearance
but
in
reality
a
day
before
the
indian
attack
the
chases
and
i
wish
i
had
not
given
the
proper
name
did
start
for
the
platte
alone
and
were
stampedoed
upon
the
waters
of
the
platte
the
mexican
fandango
true
to
the
it
does
seem
difficult
to
understand
how
they
contrived
to
keep
their
knives
out
of
the
of
the
mountaineers
but
how
can
you
account
for
the
fact
that
the
other
day
mexicans
with
pieces
of
artillery
behind
strong
entrenchments
and
two
lines
of
parapets
were
routed
by
raw
missourians
killed
as
many
more
wounded
all
their
artillery
captured
as
well
as
several
hundred
prisoners
and
that
not
one
american
was
killed
in
the
affair
is
positive
i
myself
with
three
trappers
cleared
a
fandango
at
taos
armed
only
with
score
mexicans
at
least
being
in
the
room
with
regard
to
the
incidents
of
indian
attacks
starvation
cannibalism
i
have
invented
not
one
out
of
my
own
head
they
are
all
matters
of
history
in
the
mountains
but
i
have
no
doubt
jumbled
the
one
with
another
and
may
have
committed
anachronisms
in
the
order
of
their
again
he
wrote
as
follows
i
think
it
would
be
as
well
to
correct
a
misapprehension
as
to
the
truth
or
fiction
of
the
paper
it
is
no
there
is
no
incident
in
it
which
has
not
actually
occurred
nor
one
character
who
is
not
well
known
in
the
rocky
mountains
with
the
exception
of
two
whose
names
are
originals
of
these
being
however
equally
well
known
with
the
his
last
letter
written
just
before
his
departure
from
england
a
few
weeks
previously
to
his
death
will
hardly
be
read
by
any
one
who
ever
knew
the
writer
without
a
tear
of
sympathy
for
the
sad
fate
of
this
fine
young
man
dying
miserably
in
a
strange
land
before
he
had
well
commenced
the
hazardous
journey
whose
excitement
and
dangers
he
so
joyously
anticipated
as
you
say
human
nature
ca
go
on
feeding
on
civilised
fixings
in
this
village
and
this
child
has
felt
like
going
west
for
many
a
month
being
half
froze
for
buffler
meat
and
mountain
doins
my
route
takes
me
new
york
the
lakes
and
st
louis
to
fort
leavenworth
or
independence
on
the
indian
frontier
thence
packing
my
on
a
mule
and
mounting

if
he
is
alive

strike
the

in
the
bayou

where
killbuck
and
la
bonté
joined
the
yutes

the
mountains
next
spring
to
great
salt
that
far
enough
to
look
forward
supposing
my
hair
is
not
lifted
by
comanche
or
pawnee
on
the
scalping
route
of
the
coon
creeks
and
pawnee
poor
fellow
he
spoke
lightly
in
the
buoyancy
of
youth
and
a
confident
spirit
of
the
fate
he
little
thought
to
meet
but
which
too
surely
overtook
indeed
by
indian
blade
but
by
the
no
less
deadly
stroke
of
disease
another
motive
besides
that
love
of
rambling
and
adventure
which
once
conceived
and
indulged
is
so
difficult
to
eradicate
impelled
him
across
the
atlantic
he
had
for
some
time
been
out
of
health
at
intervals
and
he
thought
the
air
of
his
beloved
prairies
would
be
efficacious
to
work
a
cure
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
in
the
month
of
may
last
he
thus
referred
to
the
probable
origin
of
the
evil
i
have
been
confined
to
my
room
for
many
days
from
the
effects
of
an
accident
i
met
with
in
the
rocky
mountains
having
been
spilt
from
the
bare
back
of
a
mule
and
falling
on
the
sharp
picket
of
an
indian
lodge
on
the
small
of
my
back
i
fear
i
injured
my
spine
for
i
have
never
felt
altogether
the
thing
since
and
shortly
after
i
saw
you
the
symptoms
became
rather
ugly
however
i
am
now
getting
round
his
medical
advisers
shared
his
opinion
that
he
had
sustained
internal
injury
from
this
ugly
fall
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
it
was
the
remote
but
real
cause
of
his
dissolution
from
whatsoever
this
ensued
it
will
be
a
source
of
deep
and
lasting
regret
to
all
who
ever
enjoyed
opportunities
of
appreciating
the
high
and
sterling
qualities
of
george
frederick
ruxton
few
men
so
prepossessing
on
first
acquaintance
gained
so
much
by
being
better
known
with
great
natural
abilities
and
the
most
dauntless
bravery
he
united
a
modesty
and
gentleness
peculiarly
pleasing
had
he
lived
and
resisted
his
friends
repeated
solicitations
to
abandon
a
roving
life
and
settle
down
in
england
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
he
would
have
made
his
name
eminent
on
the
list
of
those
daring
and
persevering
men
whose
travels
in
distant
and
dangerous
lands
have
accumulated
for
england
and
for
the
world
so
rich
a
store
of
scientific
and
general
information
and
although
the
few
words
it
has
been
thought
right
and
becoming
here
to
devote
to
his
memory
will
doubtless
be
more
particularly
welcome
to
his
personal
friends
we
are
persuaded
that
none
will
peruse
without
interest
this
brief
tribute

the
merits
of

trappers
on
a

called

it

of

when
the
early
frosts
of

comprise
one
or
two
unusually
comfortable
shanties
but
the
numerous
stages
on
which
huge
stripes
of
buffalo
meat
were
hanging
in
process
of
cure
showed
that
the
party
had
settled
themselves
here
in
order
to
lay
in
a
store
of
provisions
or
as
it
is
termed
in
the
language
of
the
mountains
to
make
round
the
camp
fed
twelve
or
fifteen
mules
and
horses
their
confined
by
hobbles
of
raw
hide
and
guarding
these
animals
two
men
paced
backwards
and
forwards
driving
in
the
stragglers
ascending
ever
and
anon
the
bluffs
which
overhung
the
river
and
leaning
on
their
long
rifles
whilst
they
swept
with
their
eyes
the
surrounding
prairie
three
or
four
fires
burned
in
the
encampment
at
some
of
which
indian
women
carefully
tended
sundry
steaming
pots
whilst
round
one
which
was
in
the
centre
of
it
four
or
five
stalwart
hunters
clad
in
buckskin
sat
pipe
in
mouth
they
were
a
trapping
party
from
the
north
fork
of
platte
on
their
way
to
in
the
more
southern
valley
of
the
arkansa
some
indeed
meditating
a
more
extended
trip
even
to
the
distant
settlements
of
new
mexico
the
paradise
of
mountaineers
the
elder
of
the
company
was
a
tall
gaunt
man
with
a
face
browned
by
twenty
exposure
to
the
extreme
climate
of
the
mountains
his
long
black
hair
as
yet
scarcely
tinged
with
grey
hanging
almost
to
his
shoulders
but
his
cheeks
and
chin
clean
shaven
after
the
fashion
of
the
mountain
men
his
dress
was
the
usual
of
buckskin
with
long
fringes
down
the
seams
with
pantaloons
similarly
ornamented
and
moccasins
of
indian
make
whilst
his
companions
puffed
their
pipes
in
silence
he
narrated
a
few
of
his
former
experiences
of
western
life
and
whilst
the
buffalo
and
tender
loin
are
singing
away
in
the
pot
preparing
for
the
hunters
supper
we
will
note
down
the
yarn
as
it
spins
from
his
lips

tearin
after
their
hair
and
whooping
like
mad
young
jem
bulcher
was
the
last
and
when
he
seed
it
was
no
use
and
his
time
was
nigh
he
throw
himself
off
the
mule
and
standing
as
upright
as
a
hickory
wiping
stick
he
waves
his
hand
to
us
and
blazes
away
at
the
first
injun
as
come
up
and
dropped
him
slick
but
the
moment
after
you
may
guess
died
we
could
do
nothin
for
before
our
guns
were
loaded
all
three
were
dead
and
their
scalps
gone
five
of
our
boys
got
rubbed
out
that
time
and
seven
injuns
lay
wolf
meat
while
a
many
more
went
away
i
lay
five
of
us
went
under
and
the
pawnees
made
a
raise
of
a
dozen
mules
wagh
thus
far
in
his
own
words
we
have
accompanied
the
old
hunter
in
his
tale
and
probably
he
would
have
taken
us
by
the
time
that
the
squaw
chilipat
had
pronounced
the
beaver
tails
cooked
safely
across
the
grand
cotton
wood
turkey
creek
little
arkansa
walnut
creek
and
pawnee
the
fireless
route
of
the
coon
creeks
through
a
sea
of
fat
buffalo
meat
without
fuel
to
cook
it
have
struck
the
big
river
and
leaving
at
the
crossing
the
waggons
destined
for
santa
fé
have
trailed
us
up
the
arkansa
to
bent
fort
thence
up
boiling
spring
across
the
divide
over
to
the
southern
fork
of
the
platte
away
up
to
the
black
hills
and
finally
camped
us
with
hair
still
preserved
in
the
valleys
of
the
sweet
water
and
câche
la
poudre
under
the
rugged
shadow
of
the
wind
river
mountains
if
it
had
not
so
happened
at
this
juncture
as
all
our
mountaineers
sat
round
the
fire
pipe
in
mouth
and
with
indian
gravity
listened
to
the
yarn
of
the
old
trapper
interrupting
him
only
with
an
occasional
wagh
or
with
the
exclamations
of
some
participator
in
the
events
then
under
narration
who
would
every
now
and
then
put
in
a
corroborative
this
child
remembers
that
fix
or
hyar
a
niggur
lifted
hair
that
spree
a
whizzing
noise
was
heard
in
the
air
followed
by
a
sharp
but
suppressed
cry
from
one
of
the
hunters
in
an
instant
the
mountaineers
had
sprung
from
their
seats
and
seizing
the
rifle
each
one
had
thrown
himself
on
the
ground
a
few
paces
beyond
the
light
of
the
fire
for
it
was
now
but
not
a
word
escaped
them
as
lying
close
with
their
keen
eyes
directed
towards
the
gloom
of
the
thicket
near
which
the
camp
was
placed
with
rifles
cocked
they
waited
a
renewal
of
the
attack
presently
the
leader
of
the
band
no
other
than
killbuck
who
had
so
lately
been
recounting
some
of
his
experiences
across
the
plains
and
than
whom
no
more
crafty
woodsman
or
more
expert
trapper
ever
tracked
a
deer
or
grained
a
beaverskin
raised
his
tall
form
and
placing
his
hand
over
his
mouth
made
the
prairie
ring
with
the
wild
protracted
note
of
an
indian
this
was
instantly
repeated
from
the
direction
where
the
animals
belonging
to
the
camp
were
grazing
under
the
charge
of
the
three
shrill
whoops
answered
the
warning
of
the
leader
and
showed
that
the
guard
was
on
the
alert
and
understood
the
signal
however
with
the
manifestation
of
their
presence
the
indians
appeared
to
be
satisfied
or
what
is
more
probable
the
act
of
aggression
had
been
committed
by
some
daring
young
warrior
who
being
out
on
his
first
expedition
desired
to
strike
the
first
and
thus
signalise
himself
at
the
outset
of
the
campaign
after
waiting
some
few
minutes
expecting
a
renewal
of
the
attack
the
mountaineers
in
a
body
rose
from
the
ground
and
made
towards
the
animals
with
which
they
presently
returned
to
the
camp
and
after
carefully
hobbling
and
securing
them
to
pickets
firmly
driven
into
the
ground
mounting
an
additional
guard
and
examining
the
neighbouring
thicket
they
once
more
assembled
round
the
fire
relit
their
pipes
and
puffed
away
the
cheering
weed
as
composedly
as
if
no
such
being
as
a
redskin
thirsting
for
their
lives
was
within
a
thousand
miles
of
their
perilous
encampment
if
ever
thar
was
bad
injuns
on
these
plains
at
last
growled
killbuck
biting
hard
the
between
his
teeth
it
these
rapahos
and
the
meanest
kind
at
ca
beat
the
blackfeet
any
how
chimed
in
one
la
bonté
from
the
yellow
stone
country
a
fine
handsome
specimen
of
a
mountaineer
however
one
of
you
quit
this
arrow
out
of
my
hump
he
continued
bending
forwards
to
the
fire
and
exhibiting
an
arrow
sticking
out
under
his
right
and
a
stream
of
blood
trickling
down
his
buckskin
coat
from
the
wound
this
his
nearest
neighbour
essayed
to
do
but
finding
after
a
tug
that
it
would
not
come
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
offending
weapon
would
have
to
be
butchered
out
this
was
accordingly
effected
with
the
ready
blade
of
a
and
a
handful
of
being
placed
on
the
wound
and
secured
by
a
strap
of
buckskin
round
the
body
the
wounded
man
donned
his
once
more
and
coolly
set
about
lighting
his
pipe
his
rifle
lying
across
his
lap
cocked
and
ready
for
use
it
was
now
near
and
misty
and
the
clouds
rolling
away
to
the
eastward
from
the
lofty
ridges
of
the
rocky
mountains
were
gradually
obscuring
the
dim
starlight
as
the
lighter
vapours
faded
from
the
mountains
a
thick
black
cloud
succeeded
them
and
settled
over
the
loftier
peaks
of
the
chain
faintly
visible
through
the
gloom
of
night
whilst
a
mass
of
fleecy
scud
soon
overspread
the
whole
sky
a
hollow
moaning
sound
crept
through
the
valley
and
the
upper
branches
of
the
cotton
woods
with
their
withered
leaves
began
to
rustle
with
the
first
breath
of
the
coming
storm
huge
drops
of
rain
fell
at
intervals
hissing
as
they
dropped
into
the
blazing
fires
and
pattering
on
the
skins
with
which
the
hunters
hurriedly
covered
the
exposed
baggage
the
mules
near
the
camp
cropped
the
grass
with
quick
and
greedy
bites
round
the
circuit
of
their
pickets
as
if
conscious
that
the
storm
would
soon
prevent
their
feeding
and
already
humped
their
backs
as
the
chilling
rain
fell
upon
their
flanks
the
prairie
wolves
crept
closer
to
the
camp
and
in
the
confusion
that
ensued
from
the
hurry
of
the
trappers
to
cover
the
perishable
portions
of
their
equipment
contrived
more
than
once
to
dart
off
with
a
piece
of
meat
when
their
peculiar
and
mournful
chiding
would
be
heard
as
they
fought
for
the
possession
of
the
ravished
morsel
when
every
thing
was
duly
protected
the
men
set
to
work
to
spread
their
beds
those
who
had
not
troubled
themselves
to
erect
a
shelter
getting
under
the
lee
of
the
piles
of
packs
and
saddles
whilst
killbuck
disdaining
even
such
care
of
his
carcass
threw
his
buffalo
robe
on
the
bare
ground
declaring
his
intention
to
take
what
was
coming
at
all
hazards
and
any
selecting
a
high
spot
he
drew
his
knife
and
proceeded
to
cut
drains
round
it
to
prevent
the
water
running
into
him
as
he
lay
then
taking
a
single
robe
he
carefully
spread
it
placing
under
the
end
farthest
from
the
fire
a
large
stone
brought
from
the
creek
having
satisfactorily
adjusted
this
pillow
he
added
another
robe
to
the
one
already
laid
and
placed
over
all
a
navajo
blanket
supposed
to
be
impervious
to
rain
then
he
divested
himself
of
his
pouch
and
which
with
his
rifle
he
placed
inside
his
bed
and
quickly
covered
up
lest
the
wet
should
reach
them
having
performed
these
operations
to
his
satisfaction
he
lighted
his
pipe
by
the
hissing
embers
of
the
fire
for
by
this
time
the
rain
poured
in
torrents
and
went
the
rounds
of
the
picketed
animals
cautioning
the
guard
round
the
camp
to
keep
their
eyes
skinned
for
there
would
be
burned
before
then
returning
to
the
fire
and
kicking
with
his
mocassined
foot
the
slumbering
ashes
he
squatted
down
before
it
and
thus
soliloquised
thirty
year
have
i
been
knocking
about
these
mountains
from
missoura
head
as
far
sothe
as
the
starving
gila
i
trapped
a
and
many
a
hundred
pack
of
beaver
i
traded
in
my
time
wagh
what
has
come
of
it
and
whar
the
dollars
as
ought
to
be
in
my
possibles
whar
the
ind
of
this
i
say
is
a
man
to
be
hunted
by
injuns
all
his
days
many
the
time
i
said
i
strike
for
taos
and
trap
a
squaw
for
this
child
getting
old
and
feels
like
wanting
a
woman
face
about
his
lodge
for
the
balance
of
his
days
but
when
it
comes
to
caching
of
the
old
traps
i
the
smallest
kind
of
heart
i
have
certain
the
comes
across
my
mind
now
and
again
but
who
thar
to
remember
my
old
body
but
them
diggings
gets
too
over
crowded
and
its
hard
to
fetch
breath
amongst
them
big
bands
of
corncrackers
to
missoura
beside
it
goes
against
natur
to
leave
bufler
meat
and
feed
on

and
them
white

too
much
like
picturs
and
a

times

dozen
pack
right
handy
and
then
he
take
the
taos
trail
wagh
thus
soliloquising
killbuck
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
placed
it
in
the
gaily
ornamented
case
that
hung
round
his
neck
drew
his
a
couple
of
holes
tighter
resumed
his
pouch
and
took
his
rifle
which
he
carefully
covered
with
the
folds
of
his
navajo
blanket
and
striding
into
the
darkness
cautiously
reconnoitred
the
vicinity
of
the
camp
when
he
returned
to
the
fire
he
sat
himself
down
as
before
but
this
time
with
his
rifle
across
his
lap
and
at
intervals
his
keen
gray
eye
glanced
piercingly
around
particularly
towards
an
old
and
grizzled
mule
who
now
old
stager
as
she
was
having
filled
her
belly
stood
lazily
over
her
picket
pin
with
her
head
bent
down
and
her
long
ears
flapping
over
her
face
her
limbs
gathered
under
her
and
her
back
arched
to
throw
off
the
rain
tottering
from
side
to
side
as
she
rested
and
slept
yep
old
gal
cried
killbuck
to
the
animal
at
the
same
time
picking
a
piece
of
burnt
wood
from
the
fire
and
throwing
it
at
her
at
which
the
mule
gathered
itself
up
and
cocked
her
ears
as
she
recognised
her
master
voice
yep
old
gal
and
keep
your
nose
open
thar
brown
skin
about
i
thinkin
and
maybe
you
get
lasso
by
a
rapaho
afore
again
the
old
trapper
settled
himself
before
the
fire
and
soon
his
head
began
to
nod
as
drowsiness
stole
over
him
already
he
was
in
the
land
of
dreams
revelling
amongst
bands
of
fat
cow
or
hunting
along
a
stream
well
peopled
with
beaver
with
no
indian
sign
to
disturb
him
and
the
merry
rendezvous
in
close
perspective
and
his
peltry
selling
briskly
at
six
dollars
the
plew
and
galore
of
alcohol
to
ratify
the
trade
or
perhaps
threading
the
back
trail
of
his
memory
he
passed
rapidly
through
the
perilous
vicissitudes
of
his
hard
hard
one
day
revelling
in
abundance
the
next
now
beset
by
whooping
savages
thirsting
for
his
blood
baying
his
enemies
like
the
hunted
deer
but
with
the
unflinching
courage
of
a
man
now
all
care
thrown
aside
secure
and
forgetful
of
the
past
a
welcome
guest
in
the
hospitable
trading
fort
or
back
as
the
trail
gets
fainter
to
his
childhood
home
in
the
brown
forests
of
old
kentuck
tended
and
cared
only
thought
to
enjoy
the
homminy
and
johnny
cakes
of
his
thrifty
mother
once
more
in
warm
and
well
remembered
homespun
he
sits
on
the
snake
fence
round
the
old
clearing
and
munching
his
at
set
of
sun
listens
to
the
mournful
note
of
the
or
the
harsh
cry
of
the
noisy
catbird
or
watches
the
agile
gambols
of
the
squirrels
as
they
chase
each
other
chattering
the
while
from
branch
to
branch
of
the
lofty
tamarisks
wondering
how
long
it
will
be
before
he
will
be
able
to
lift
his
father
heavy
rifle
and
use
it
against
the
tempting
game
sleep
however
sat
lightly
on
the
eyes
of
the
wary
mountaineer
and
a
snort
from
the
old
mule
in
an
instant
stretched
his
every
nerve
without
a
movement
of
his
body
his
keen
eye
fixed
itself
upon
the
mule
which
now
stood
with
head
bent
round
and
eyes
and
ears
pointed
in
one
direction
snuffing
the
night
air
and
snorting
with
apparent
fear
a
low
sound
from
the
wakeful
hunter
roused
the
others
from
their
sleep
and
raising
their
bodies
from
their
beds
a
single
word
apprised
them
of
their
danger
injuns
scarcely
was
the
word
out
of
killbuck
lips
when
above
the
howling
of
the
furious
wind
and
the
pattering
of
the
rain
a
hundred
savage
yells
broke
suddenly
upon
their
ears
from
all
directions
round
the
camp
a
score
of
rattled
from
the
thicket
and
a
cloud
of
arrows
whistled
through
the
air
whilst
a
crowd
of
indians
charged
upon
the
picketed
animals
owgh
a
foot
by
gor
shouted
killbuck
and
the
old
mule
gone
at
that
on
boys
for
old
kentuck
and
he
rushed
towards
his
mule
which
jumped
and
snorted
mad
with
fright
as
a
naked
indian
strove
to
fasten
a
lariat
round
her
nose
having
already
cut
the
rope
which
fastened
her
to
the
quit
that
you
cussed
devil
roared
the
trapper
as
he
jumped
upon
the
savage
and
without
raising
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
made
a
deliberate
thrust
with
the
muzzle
at
his
naked
breast
striking
him
full
and
at
the
same
time
pulling
the
trigger
actually
driving
the
indian
two
paces
backwards
with
the
shock
when
he
fell
in
a
heap
and
dead
but
at
the
same
moment
an
indian
sweeping
his
club
round
his
head
brought
it
with
fatal
force
down
upon
killbuck
for
a
moment
the
hunter
staggered
threw
out
his
arms
wildly
into
the
air
and
fell
headlong
to
the
ground
owgh
owgh
cried
the
rapaho
and
striding
over
the
prostrate
body
he
seized
with
his
left
hand
the
middle
lock
of
the
trapper
long
hair
and
drew
his
knife
round
the
head
to
separate
the
scalp
from
the
skull
as
he
bent
over
to
his
work
the
trapper
named
la
bonté
saw
his
companion
peril
rushed
quick
as
thought
at
the
indian
and
buried
his
knife
to
the
hilt
between
his
shoulders
with
a
gasping
shudder
the
rapaho
fell
dead
upon
the
prostrate
body
of
his
foe
the
attack
however
lasted
but
a
few
seconds
the
dash
at
the
animals
had
been
entirely
successful
and
driving
them
before
them
with
loud
cries
the
indians
disappeared
quickly
in
the
darkness
without
waiting
for
daylight
two
of
the
three
trappers
who
alone
were
to
be
seen
and
who
had
been
within
the
shanties
at
the
time
of
attack
without
a
moment
delay
commenced
packing
two
horses
which
having
been
fastened
to
the
shanties
had
escaped
the
indians
and
placing
their
squaws
upon
them
showering
curses
and
imprecations
on
their
enemies
left
the
camp
fearful
of
another
onset
and
resolved
to
retreat
and
câche
themselves
until
the
danger
was
over
not
so
la
bonté
who
stout
and
true
had
done
his
best
in
the
fight
and
now
sought
the
body
of
his
old
comrade
from
which
before
he
could
examine
the
wounds
he
had
first
to
remove
the
corpse
of
the
indian
he
had
slain
killbuck
still
breathed
he
had
been
stunned
but
revived
by
the
cold
rain
beating
upon
his
face
he
soon
opened
his
eyes
and
recognised
his
trusty
friend
who
sitting
down
lifted
his
head
into
his
lap
and
wiped
away
the
blood
that
streamed
from
the
wounded
scalp
is
the
gone
boy
asked
killbuck
for
my
head
feels
queersome
i
tell
thar
the
injun
as
felt
like
lifting
it
answered
the
other
kicking
the
dead
body
with
his
foot
wagh
boy
you
struck
a
coup
so
scalp
the
nigger
right
off
and
then
fetch
me
a
the
morning
broke
clear
and
cold
with
the
exception
of
a
light
cloud
which
hung
over
pike
peak
the
sky
was
spotless
and
a
perfect
calm
had
succeeded
the
boisterous
storm
of
the
previous
night
the
creek
was
swollen
and
turbid
with
the
rains
and
as
la
bonté
proceeded
a
little
distance
down
the
bank
to
find
a
passage
to
the
water
he
suddenly
stopped
short
and
an
involuntary
cry
escaped
him
within
a
few
feet
of
the
bank
lay
the
body
of
one
of
his
companions
who
had
formed
the
guard
at
the
time
of
the
indians
attack
it
was
lying
on
the
face
pierced
through
the
chest
with
an
arrow
which
was
buried
to
the
very
feathers
and
the
scalp
torn
from
the
bloody
skull
beyond
but
all
within
a
hundred
yards
lay
the
three
others
dead
and
similarly
mutilated
so
certain
had
been
the
aim
and
so
close
the
enemy
that
each
had
died
without
a
struggle
and
consequently
had
been
unable
to
alarm
the
camp
la
bonté
with
a
glance
at
the
bank
saw
at
once
that
the
wily
indians
had
crept
along
the
creek
the
noise
of
the
storm
facilitating
their
approach
undiscovered
and
crawling
up
the
bank
had
watched
their
opportunity
to
shoot
simultaneously
the
four
hunters
on
guard
returning
to
killbuck
he
apprised
him
of
the
melancholy
fate
of
their
companions
and
held
a
council
of
war
as
to
their
proceedings
the
old
hunter
mind
was
soon
made
up
first
said
he
i
get
back
my
old
mule
she
carried
me
and
my
traps
these
twelve
years
and
i
aint
a
goin
to
lose
her
yet
second
i
feel
like
taking
hair
and
some
rapahos
has
to
under
for
this
night
work
third
we
have
got
to
câche
the
beaver
fourth
we
take
the
injun
trail
wharever
it
no
more
daring
mountaineer
than
la
bonté
ever
trapped
a
beaver
and
no
counsel
could
have
more
exactly
tallied
with
his
own
inclination
than
the
law
laid
down
by
old
killbuck
agreed
was
his
answer
and
forthwith
he
set
about
forming
a
câche
in
this
instance
they
had
not
sufficient
time
to
construct
a
regular
one
so
they
contented
themselves
with
securing
their
packs
of
beaver
in
buffalo
robes
and
tying
them
in
the
forks
of
several
under
which
the
camp
had
been
made
this
done
they
lit
a
fire
and
cooked
some
buffalo
meat
and
whilst
smoking
a
pipe
carefully
cleaned
their
rifles
and
filled
their
horns
and
pouches
with
good
store
of
ammunition
a
prominent
feature
in
the
character
of
the
hunters
of
the
far
west
is
their
quick
determination
and
resolve
in
cases
of
extreme
difficulty
and
peril
and
their
fixedness
of
purpose
when
any
plan
of
operations
has
been
laid
requiring
bold
and
instant
action
in
carrying
out
it
is
here
that
they
so
infinitely
surpass
the
savage
indian
in
bringing
to
a
successful
issue
their
numerous
hostile
expeditions
against
the
natural
foe
of
the
white
man
in
the
wild
and
barbarous
regions
of
the
west
ready
to
resolve
as
they
are
prompt
to
execute
and
combining
far
greater
dash
and
daring
with
equal
subtlety
and
caution
they
possess
great
advantage
over
the
vacillating
indian
whose
superstitious
mind
in
a
great
degree
paralyses
the
physical
energy
of
his
active
body
and
who
by
waiting
for
propitious
signs
and
seasons
before
he
undertakes
an
enterprise
often
loses
the
opportunity
by
which
his
white
and
more
civilised
enemy
knows
so
well
how
to
profit
killbuck
and
la
bonté
were
no
exceptions
to
this
characteristic
rule
and
before
the
sun
was
a
above
the
eastern
horizon
the
two
hunters
were
running
on
the
trail
of
the
victorious
indians
striking
from
the
creek
where
the
night
attack
was
made
they
crossed
to
another
known
as
kioway
running
parallel
to
bijou
a
few
journey
westward
and
likewise
heading
in
the
following
this
to
its
forks
they
struck
into
the
upland
prairies
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
and
crossing
to
the
numerous
which
feed
the
creek
called
vermilion
or
cherry
they
pursued
the
trail
over
the
until
it
reached
a
fork
of
the
boiling
spring
here
the
had
halted
and
held
a
consultation
for
from
this
point
the
trail
turned
at
a
tangent
to
the
westward
and
entered
the
rugged
gorges
of
the
mountains
it
was
now
evident
to
the
two
trappers
that
their
destination
was
the
bayou
salade
mountain
valley
which
is
a
favourite
resort
of
the
buffalo
in
the
winter
season
and
which
and
for
this
reason
is
often
frequented
by
the
yuta
indians
as
their
wintering
ground
that
the
rapahos
were
on
a
war
expedition
against
the
yutas
there
was
little
doubt
and
killbuck
who
knew
every
inch
of
the
ground
saw
at
once
by
the
direction
the
trail
had
taken
that
they
were
making
for
the
bayou
in
order
to
surprise
their
enemies
and
therefore
were
not
following
the
usual
indian
trail
up
the
cañon
of
the
boiling
spring
river
having
made
up
his
mind
to
this
he
at
once
struck
across
the
broken
ground
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
steering
a
course
a
little
to
the
eastward
of
north
or
almost
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
and
then
pointing
westward
about
noon
he
crossed
a
mountain
chain
and
descending
into
a
ravine
through
which
a
little
rivulet
tumbled
over
its
rocky
bed
he
at
once
proved
the
correctness
of
his
judgment
by
striking
the
indian
trail
now
quite
fresh
as
it
wound
through
the
cañon
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
the
route
he
had
followed
impracticable
to
had
saved
at
least
journey
and
brought
them
within
a
short
distance
of
the
object
of
their
pursuit
for
at
the
head
of
the
gorge
a
lofty
bluff
presenting
itself
the
hunters
ascended
to
the
summit
and
looking
down
descried
at
their
very
feet
the
indian
camp
with
their
own
stolen
cavallada
feeding
quietly
round
wagh
exclaimed
both
the
hunters
in
a
breath
and
thar
the
old
at
that
chuckled
killbuck
as
he
recognised
his
old
grizzled
mule
making
good
play
at
the
rich
buffalo
grass
with
which
these
mountain
valleys
abound
if
we
do
make
raise
afore
long
i
would
say
so
thar
plans
is
plain
to
this
child
as
beaver
sign
they
after
yuta
hair
as
certain
as
this
gun
has
got
but
they
agoin
to
pack
them
animals
after
and
have
crawled
like
along
this
bottom
to
câche
till
they
come
back
from
the
bayou
maybe
they
leave
half
a
dozen
with
how
right
the
wily
trapper
was
in
his
conjectures
will
be
shortly
proved
meanwhile
with
his
companion
he
descended
the
bluff
and
pushing
his
way
into
a
thicket
of
dwarf
pine
and
cedar
sat
down
on
a
log
and
drew
from
an
end
of
the
blanket
strapped
on
his
shoulder
a
portion
of
a
buffalo
liver
which
they
both
discussed
with
infinite
relish
eating
in
lieu
of
bread
an
unknown
luxury
in
these
parts
sundry
strips
of
dried
fat
to
have
kindled
a
fire
would
have
been
dangerous
since
it
was
not
impossible
that
some
of
the
indians
might
leave
their
camp
to
hunt
when
the
smoke
would
at
once
have
betrayed
the
presence
of
enemies
a
light
was
struck
however
for
their
pipes
and
after
enjoying
this
true
consolation
for
some
time
they
laid
a
blanket
on
the
ground
and
side
by
side
soon
fell
asleep
if
killbuck
had
been
a
prophet
or
the
most
prescient
of
medicine
men
he
could
not
have
more
exactly
predicted
the
movements
in
the
indian
camp
about
three
hours
before
sundown
he
rose
and
shook
himself
which
movement
was
sufficient
to
awaken
his
companion
telling
la
bonté
to
lie
down
again
and
rest
he
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
was
about
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
camp
and
after
carefully
examining
his
rifle
and
drawing
his
a
hole
or
two
tighter
he
proceeded
on
his
dangerous
errand
ascending
the
same
bluff
whence
he
had
first
discovered
the
indian
camp
he
glanced
rapidly
around
and
made
himself
master
of
the
features
of
the
a
ravine
by
which
he
might
approach
the
camp
more
closely
and
without
danger
of
being
discovered
this
was
soon
effected
and
in
half
an
hour
the
trapper
was
lying
on
his
belly
on
the
summit
of
a
bluff
which
overlooked
the
indians
within
easy
and
so
perfectly
concealed
by
the
low
spreading
branches
of
the
cedar
and
that
not
a
particle
of
his
person
could
be
detected
unless
indeed
his
sharp
twinkling
gray
eye
contrasted
too
strongly
with
the
green
boughs
that
covered
the
rest
of
his
face
moreover
there
was
no
danger
of
their
hitting
upon
his
trail
for
he
had
been
careful
to
pick
his
steps
on
the
ground
so
that
not
a
track
of
his
moccasin
was
visible
here
he
lay
still
as
a
carcagien
in
wait
for
a
deer
only
now
and
then
shaking
the
boughs
as
his
body
quivered
with
a
suppressed
chuckle
when
any
movement
in
the
indian
camp
caused
him
to
laugh
inwardly
at
his
if
they
had
known
it
unwelcome
propinquity
he
was
not
a
little
surprised
however
to
discover
that
the
party
was
much
smaller
than
he
had
imagined
counting
only
forty
warriors
and
this
assured
him
that
the
band
had
divided
one
half
taking
the
yuta
trail
by
the
boiling
spring
the
other
the
one
before
him
taking
a
longer
circuit
in
order
to
reach
the
bayou
and
make
the
attack
on
the
yutas
in
a
different
direction
at
this
moment
the
indians
were
in
deliberation
seated
in
a
large
circle
round
a
very
small
fire
the
smoke
from
which
ascended
in
a
thin
straight
column
they
each
in
turn
puffed
a
huge
cloud
of
smoke
from
three
or
four
long
pipes
which
went
the
round
of
the
party
each
warrior
touching
the
ground
with
the
heel
of
the
and
turning
the
stem
upwards
and
away
from
him
as
medicine
to
the
great
spirit
before
he
himself
inhaled
the
fragrant
the
council
however
was
not
general
for
only
fifteen
of
the
older
warriors
took
part
in
it
the
others
sitting
outside
and
at
some
little
distance
from
the
circle
behind
each
were
his
and
quiver
and
shield
hanging
from
a
spear
stuck
in
the
ground
and
a
few
guns
in
ornamented
covers
of
buckskin
were
added
to
some
of
the
equipments
near
the
fire
and
in
the
centre
of
the
inner
circle
a
spear
was
fixed
upright
in
the
ground
and
on
this
dangled
the
four
scalps
of
the
trappers
killed
the
preceding
night
and
underneath
them
affixed
to
the
same
spear
was
the
mystic
medicine
bag
by
which
killbuck
knew
that
the
band
before
him
was
under
the
command
of
the
chief
of
the
tribe
towards
the
grim
trophies
on
the
spear
the
warriors
who
in
turn
addressed
the
council
frequently
than
one
as
he
did
so
making
the
gyratory
motion
of
the
right
hand
and
arm
which
the
indians
use
in
describing
that
they
have
gained
an
advantage
by
skill
or
cunning
then
pointing
westward
the
speaker
would
thrust
out
his
arm
extending
his
fingers
at
the
same
time
and
closing
and
reopening
them
repeatedly
meaning
that
although
four
scalps
already
ornamented
the
medicine
pole
they
were
as
nothing
compared
to
the
numerous
trophies
they
would
bring
from
the
salt
valley
where
they
expected
to
find
their
hereditary
enemies
the
yutas
that
now
was
not
the
time
to
count
their
coups
for
at
this
moment
one
of
the
warriors
rose
from
his
seat
and
swelling
with
pride
advanced
towards
the
spear
pointing
to
one
of
the
scalps
and
then
striking
his
open
hand
on
his
naked
breast
jumped
into
the
air
as
if
about
to
go
through
the
ceremony
that
before
many
suns
all
their
spears
together
would
not
hold
the
scalps
they
had
taken
and
that
they
would
return
to
their
village
and
spend
a
moon
relating
their
achievements
and
counting
all
this
killbuck
learned
thanks
to
his
knowledge
of
the
language
of
master
of
which
if
even
he
have
no
ears
or
tongue
never
fails
to
understand
and
be
understood
by
any
of
the
hundred
tribes
whose
languages
are
perfectly
distinct
and
different
he
learned
moreover
that
at
sundown
the
greater
part
of
the
band
would
resume
the
trail
in
order
to
reach
the
bayou
by
the
earliest
dawn
and
also
that
no
more
than
four
or
five
of
the
younger
warriors
would
remain
with
the
captured
animals
still
the
hunter
remained
in
his
position
until
the
sun
had
disappeared
behind
the
ridge
when
taking
up
their
arms
and
throwing
their
buffalo
robes
on
their
shoulders
the
war
party
of
rapahos
one
behind
the
other
with
noiseless
step
and
silent
as
the
dumb
moved
away
from
the
camp
when
the
last
dusky
form
had
disappeared
behind
a
point
of
rocks
which
shut
in
the
northern
end
of
the
little
valley
or
ravine
killbuck
withdrew
his
head
from
its
screen
crawled
backwards
on
his
stomach
from
the
edge
of
the
bluff
and
rising
from
the
ground
shook
and
stretched
himself
then
gave
one
cautious
look
around
and
immediately
proceeded
to
rejoin
his
companion
get
up
boy
said
killbuck
as
soon
as
he
reached
him
hyar
grainin
to
do
afore
sun
about
down
i
ready
old
hos
answered
la
bonté
giving
himself
a
shake
the
sign
like
and
how
many
the
lodge
fresh
and
five
boy
how
do
you
feel
froze
for
wagh
we
have
moon
and
as
soon
as
gets
up
we
make
killbuck
then
described
to
his
companion
what
he
had
seen
and
detailed
his
plan
this
was
simply
to
wait
until
the
moon
afforded
sufficient
light
then
to
approach
the
indian
camp
and
charge
into
it
lift
as
much
hair
as
they
could
recover
their
animals
and
start
at
once
to
the
bayou
and
join
the
friendly
yutas
warning
them
of
the
coming
danger
the
risk
of
falling
in
with
either
of
the
rapaho
bands
was
hardly
considered
to
avoid
this
they
trusted
to
their
own
foresight
and
the
legs
of
their
mules
should
they
encounter
them
between
sundown
and
the
rising
of
the
moon
they
had
leisure
to
eat
their
supper
which
as
before
consisted
of
raw
after
discussing
which
killbuck
pronounced
himself
a
better
and
ready
for
in
the
short
interval
of
almost
perfect
darkness
which
preceded
the
moonlight
and
taking
advantage
of
one
of
the
frequent
squalls
of
wind
which
howl
down
the
narrow
gorges
of
the
mountains
these
two
determined
men
with
footsteps
noiseless
as
the
panther
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
little
plateau
of
some
hundred
yards
square
where
the
five
indians
in
charge
of
the
animals
were
seated
round
the
fire
perfectly
unconscious
of
the
vicinity
of
danger
several
clumps
of
cedar
bushes
dotted
the
small
prairie
and
amongst
these
the
mules
and
horses
were
feeding
these
animals
accustomed
to
the
presence
of
whites
would
not
notice
the
two
hunters
as
they
crept
from
clump
to
clump
nearer
to
the
fire
and
also
served
even
if
the
indians
should
be
on
the
watch
to
conceal
their
movements
from
them
this
the
two
men
at
once
perceived
but
old
killbuck
knew
that
if
he
passed
within
sight
or
smell
of
his
mule
he
would
be
received
with
a
hinny
of
recognition
which
would
at
once
alarm
the
enemy
he
therefore
first
ascertained
where
his
own
animal
was
feeding
which
luckily
was
at
the
farther
side
of
the
prairie
and
would
not
interfere
with
his
proceedings
threading
their
way
amongst
the
feeding
mules
they
approached
a
clump
of
bushes
about
forty
yards
from
the
spot
where
the
unconscious
savages
were
seated
smoking
round
the
fire
and
here
they
awaited
scarcely
drawing
breath
the
while
the
moment
when
the
moon
rose
above
the
mountain
into
the
clear
cold
sky
and
gave
them
light
sufficient
to
make
sure
their
work
of
bloody
retribution
not
a
pulsation
in
the
hearts
of
these
stern
determined
men
beat
higher
than
its
wont
not
the
tremour
of
a
nerve
disturbed
their
frame
they
stood
with
lips
compressed
and
rifles
ready
their
pistols
loosened
in
their
belts
their
handy
to
their
gripe
the
lurid
glow
of
the
coming
moon
already
shot
into
the
sky
above
the
ridge
which
stood
out
in
bold
relief
against
the
light
and
the
luminary
herself
just
peered
over
the
mountain
illuminating
its
summit
and
throwing
her
beams
on
an
opposite
peak
when
killbuck
touched
his
companion
arm
and
whispered
wait
for
the
full
light
at
this
moment
however
unseen
by
the
trapper
the
old
grizzled
mule
had
gradually
approached
as
she
fed
along
the
plateau
and
when
within
a
few
paces
of
their
retreat
a
gleam
of
moonshine
revealed
to
the
animal
the
erect
forms
of
the
two
whites
suddenly
she
stood
still
and
pricked
her
ears
and
stretching
out
her
neck
and
nose
snuffed
the
air
well
she
knew
her
old
master
killbuck
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
indians
was
on
the
point
of
giving
the
signal
of
attack
to
his
comrade
when
the
shrill
hinny
of
his
mule
reverberated
through
the
gorge
the
indians
jumped
to
their
feet
and
seized
their
arms
when
killbuck
with
a
loud
shout
of
at
boy
give
the
niggurs
rushed
from
his
concealment
and
with
la
bonté
by
his
side
yelling
a
fierce
sprung
upon
the
startled
savages
with
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
the
indians
scarcely
knew
where
to
run
and
for
a
moment
stood
huddled
together
like
sheep
down
dropped
killbuck
on
his
knee
and
stretching
out
his
planted
it
on
the
ground
at
the
extreme
length
of
his
arm
as
methodically
and
as
coolly
as
if
about
to
aim
at
a
deer
he
raised
his
rifle
to
this
rest
and
pulled
the
trigger
at
the
report
an
indian
fell
forward
on
his
face
at
the
same
moment
that
la
bonté
with
equal
certainty
of
aim
and
like
effect
discharged
his
own
rifle
the
three
surviving
indians
seeing
that
their
assailants
were
but
two
and
knowing
that
their
guns
were
empty
came
on
with
loud
yells
with
the
left
hand
grasping
a
bunch
of
arrows
and
holding
the
bow
already
bent
and
arrow
fixed
they
steadily
advanced
bending
low
to
the
ground
to
get
their
objects
between
them
and
the
light
and
thus
render
their
aim
more
certain
the
trappers
however
did
not
care
to
wait
for
them
drawing
their
pistols
they
charged
at
once
and
although
the
bows
twanged
and
the
three
arrows
struck
their
mark
on
they
rushed
discharging
their
pistols
at
close
quarters
la
bonté
threw
his
empty
one
at
the
head
of
an
indian
who
was
pulling
his
second
arrow
to
its
head
at
a
yard
distance
drew
his
knife
at
the
same
moment
and
made
at
him
but
the
indian
broke
and
ran
followed
by
his
surviving
companion
and
as
soon
as
killbuck
could
ram
home
another
ball
he
sent
a
shot
flying
after
them
as
they
scrambled
up
the
mountain
side
leaving
in
their
fright
and
hurry
their
bows
and
shields
on
the
ground
the
fight
was
over
and
the
two
trappers
confronted
each
other
given
laughed
killbuck
we
have
answered
the
other
pulling
an
arrow
out
of
his
wagh
we
lift
the
hair
any
how
continued
the
first
afore
the
scalp
taking
his
whetstone
from
the
little
sheath
on
his
the
trapper
proceeded
to
edge
his
knife
and
then
stepping
to
the
first
prostrate
body
he
turned
it
over
to
examine
if
any
symptom
of
vitality
remained
thrown
cold
he
exclaimed
as
he
dropped
the
lifeless
arm
he
had
lifted
i
sighted
him
about
the
long
ribs
but
the
light
was
bad
and
i
could
get
a
hand
any
seizing
with
his
left
hand
the
long
and
braided
lock
on
the
centre
of
the
indian
head
he
passed
the
point
edge
of
his
keen
round
the
parting
turning
it
at
the
same
time
under
the
skin
to
separate
the
scalp
from
the
skull
then
with
a
quick
and
sudden
jerk
of
his
hand
he
removed
it
entirely
from
the
head
and
giving
the
reeking
trophy
a
wring
upon
the
grass
to
free
it
from
the
blood
he
coolly
hitched
it
under
his
belt
and
proceeded
to
the
next
but
seeing
la
bonté
operating
upon
this
he
sought
the
third
who
lay
some
little
distance
from
the
others
this
one
was
still
alive
a
having
passed
through
his
body
without
touching
a
vital
spot
is
this
niggur
exclaimed
the
trapper
them
pistols
never
throws
in
their
tracks
and
thrusting
his
knife
for
sake
into
the
bosom
of
the
indian
he
likewise
tore
the
from
his
head
and
placed
it
with
the
other
la
bonté
had
received
two
trivial
wounds
and
killbuck
till
now
had
been
walking
about
with
an
arrow
sticking
through
the
fleshy
part
of
his
thigh
the
point
being
perceptible
near
the
surface
of
the
other
side
to
free
his
leg
from
the
painful
encumbrance
he
thrust
the
weapon
completely
through
and
then
cutting
off
the
below
the
barb
he
drew
it
out
the
blood
flowing
freely
from
the
wound
a
tourniquet
of
buckskin
soon
stopped
this
and
heedless
of
the
pain
the
hardy
mountaineer
sought
for
his
old
mule
and
quickly
brought
it
to
the
fire
which
la
bonté
had
rekindled
lavishing
many
a
caress
and
most
comical
terms
of
endearment
upon
the
faithful
companion
of
his
wanderings
they
found
all
the
animals
safe
and
well
and
after
eating
heartily
of
some
venison
which
the
indians
had
been
cooking
at
the
moment
of
the
attack
made
instant
preparations
to
quit
the
scene
of
their
exploit
not
wishing
to
trust
to
the
chance
of
the
rapahos
being
too
frightened
to
again
molest
them
having
no
saddles
they
secured
buffalo
robes
on
the
backs
of
two
of
course
riding
his
lost
no
time
in
proceeding
on
their
way
they
followed
the
course
of
the
indians
up
the
stream
and
found
that
it
kept
the
cañons
and
gorges
of
the
mountains
where
the
road
was
better
but
it
was
with
no
little
difficulty
that
they
made
their
way
the
ground
being
much
broken
and
covered
with
rocks
killbuck
wound
became
very
painful
and
his
leg
stiffened
and
swelled
distressingly
but
he
still
pushed
on
all
night
and
at
daybreak
recognising
their
position
he
left
the
indian
trail
and
followed
a
little
creek
which
rose
in
a
mountain
chain
of
moderate
elevation
and
above
which
and
to
the
south
peak
towered
high
into
the
clouds
with
great
difficulty
they
crossed
this
ridge
and
ascending
and
descending
several
smaller
ones
which
gradually
smoothed
away
as
they
met
the
valley
about
three
hours
after
sunrise
they
found
themselves
in
the
corner
of
the
bayou
salade
the
bayou
salade
or
salt
valley
is
the
most
southern
of
three
very
extensive
valleys
forming
a
series
of
in
the
very
centre
of
the
main
chain
of
the
rocky
mountains
known
to
the
trappers
by
the
name
of
the
the
numerous
streams
by
which
they
are
watered
abound
in
the
valuable
beaver
whilst
every
species
of
game
common
to
the
west
is
found
here
in
great
abundance
the
bayou
salade
especially
owing
to
the
salitrose
nature
of
the
soil
and
springs
is
the
favourite
resort
of
all
the
larger
animals
common
to
the
mountains
and
in
the
sheltered
prairies
of
the
bayou
the
buffalo
forsaking
the
barren
and
inclement
regions
of
the
exposed
plains
frequent
these
upland
valleys
in
the
winter
months
and
feeding
upon
the
rich
and
nutritious
buffalo
grass
which
on
the
bare
prairies
at
that
season
is
either
dry
and
rotten
or
entirely
exhausted
not
only
sustain
life
but
retain
a
great
portion
of
the
condition
that
the
abundant
fall
and
summer
pasture
of
the
lowlands
has
laid
upon
their
bones
therefore
is
this
valley
sought
by
the
indians
as
a
wintering
ground
its
occupancy
has
been
disputed
by
most
of
the
mountain
tribes
and
long
and
bloody
wars
have
been
waged
to
make
good
the
claims
set
forth
by
yuta
rapaho
sioux
and
shians
however
to
the
first
of
these
it
may
be
said
now
to
belong
since
their
big
village
has
wintered
there
for
many
successive
years
whilst
the
rapahos
seldom
visit
it
unless
on
war
expeditions
against
the
yutas
judging
from
the
direction
the
rapahos
were
taking
that
the
friendly
tribe
of
yutas
were
there
already
the
trappers
had
resolved
to
join
them
as
soon
as
possible
and
therefore
without
resting
pushed
on
through
the
uplands
and
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
had
the
satisfaction
of
descrying
the
conical
lodges
of
the
village
situated
on
a
large
level
plateau
through
which
ran
a
mountain
stream
a
numerous
band
of
mules
and
horses
were
scattered
over
the
pasture
and
round
them
several
mounted
indians
kept
guard
as
the
trappers
descended
the
bluffs
into
the
plain
some
straggling
indians
caught
sight
of
them
and
instantly
one
of
them
lassoing
a
horse
from
the
herd
mounted
it
and
flew
like
wind
to
the
village
to
spread
the
news
soon
the
lodges
disgorged
their
inmates
first
the
women
and
children
rushed
to
the
side
of
the
strangers
approach
then
the
younger
indians
unable
to
restrain
their
curiosity
mounted
their
horses
and
galloped
forth
to
meet
them
the
old
chiefs
enveloped
in
buffalo
robes
softly
and
delicately
dressed
as
the
yutas
alone
know
how
and
with
tomahawk
held
in
one
hand
and
resting
in
the
hollow
of
the
other
arm
sallied
last
of
all
from
their
lodges
and
squatting
in
a
row
on
a
sunny
bank
outside
the
village
awaited
with
dignified
composure
the
arrival
of
the
whites
killbuck
was
well
known
to
most
of
them
having
trapped
in
their
country
and
traded
with
them
years
before
at
roubideau
fort
at
the
head
waters
of
the
rio
grande
after
shaking
hands
with
all
who
presented
themselves
he
at
once
gave
them
to
understand
that
their
enemies
the
rapahos
were
at
hand
with
a
hundred
warriors
at
least
elated
by
the
coup
they
had
just
struck
against
the
whites
bringing
moreover
four
white
scalps
to
incite
them
to
brave
deeds
at
this
news
the
whole
village
was
speedily
in
commotion
the
was
taken
up
from
lodge
to
lodge
the
squaws
began
to
lament
and
tear
their
hair
the
warriors
to
paint
and
arm
themselves
the
elder
chiefs
immediately
met
in
council
and
over
the
debated
as
to
the
best
course
to
pursue
to
wait
the
attack
or
sally
out
and
meet
the
enemy
in
the
mean
time
the
braves
were
collected
together
by
the
chiefs
of
their
respective
bands
and
scouts
mounted
on
the
fastest
horses
despatched
in
every
direction
to
procure
intelligence
of
the
enemy
the
two
whites
after
watering
their
mules
and
picketing
them
in
some
good
grass
near
the
village
drew
near
the
council
fire
without
however
joining
in
the
talk
until
they
were
invited
to
take
their
seats
by
the
eldest
chief
then
killbuck
was
called
upon
to
give
his
opinion
as
to
the
direction
in
which
he
judged
the
rapahos
to
be
approaching
which
he
delivered
in
their
own
language
with
which
he
was
well
acquainted
in
a
short
time
the
council
broke
up
and
without
noise
or
confusion
a
band
of
one
hundred
chosen
warriors
left
the
village
immediately
after
one
of
the
scouts
had
galloped
in
and
communicated
some
intelligence
to
the
chiefs
killbuck
and
la
bonté
volunteered
to
accompany
the
weak
and
exhausted
as
they
were
but
this
was
negatived
by
the
chiefs
who
left
their
white
brothers
to
the
care
of
the
women
who
tended
their
wounds
now
stiff
and
painful
and
spreading
their
buffalo
robes
in
a
warm
and
roomy
lodge
left
them
to
the
repose
they
so
much
needed
chapter
ii
the
next
morning
killbuck
leg
was
greatly
inflamed
and
he
was
unable
to
leave
the
lodge
but
he
made
his
companion
bring
the
old
mule
to
the
door
that
he
might
give
her
a
couple
of
ears
of
indian
corn
the
last
remains
of
the
slender
store
brought
by
the
indians
from
the
navajo
country
the
day
passed
and
sundown
brought
no
tidings
of
the
this
caused
no
little
wailing
on
the
part
of
the
squaws
but
was
interpreted
by
the
whites
as
a
favourable
augury
a
little
after
sunrise
on
the
second
morning
the
long
line
of
the
returning
warriors
was
discerned
winding
over
the
prairie
and
a
scout
having
galloped
in
to
bring
the
news
of
a
great
victory
the
whole
village
was
soon
in
a
ferment
of
paint
and
drumming
a
short
distance
from
the
lodges
the
warriors
halted
to
await
the
approach
of
the
people
old
men
children
and
squaws
sitting
astride
their
horses
sallied
out
to
escort
the
victorious
party
in
triumph
to
the
village
with
loud
shouts
and
songs
and
drums
beating
the
monotonous
indian
time
they
advanced
and
encircled
the
returning
braves
one
of
whom
his
face
covered
with
black
paint
carried
a
pole
on
which
dangled
thirteen
scalps
the
trophies
of
the
expedition
as
he
lifted
these
on
high
they
were
saluted
with
deafening
whoops
and
cries
of
exultation
and
savage
joy
in
this
manner
they
entered
the
village
almost
before
the
friends
of
those
fallen
in
the
fight
had
ascertained
their
losses
then
the
shouts
of
delight
were
converted
into
yells
of
grief
the
mothers
and
wives
of
those
braves
who
had
been
killed
and
seven
had
gone
under
presently
returned
with
their
faces
necks
and
hands
blackened
and
danced
and
howled
round
the
which
had
been
deposited
in
the
centre
of
the
village
in
front
of
the
lodge
of
the
great
chief
killbuck
now
learned
that
a
scout
having
brought
intelligence
that
the
two
bands
of
rapahos
were
hastening
to
form
a
junction
as
soon
as
they
learned
that
their
approach
was
discovered
the
yutas
had
successfully
prevented
it
and
attacking
one
party
had
entirely
defeated
it
killing
thirteen
of
the
rapaho
braves
the
other
party
had
fled
on
seeing
the
issue
of
the
fight
and
a
few
of
the
yuta
warriors
were
now
pursuing
them
to
celebrate
so
signal
a
victory
great
preparations
sounded
their
notes
through
the
village
paints
and
and
yellow
in
great
request
whilst
the
scrapings
of
charred
wood
mixed
with
gunpowder
were
used
as
substitute
for
black
the
medicine
colour
the
lodges
of
the
village
numbering
some
two
hundred
or
more
were
erected
in
parallel
lines
and
covered
a
large
space
of
the
level
prairie
in
shape
of
a
parallelogram
in
the
centre
however
the
space
which
half
a
dozen
lodges
in
length
would
have
taken
up
was
left
unoccupied
save
by
one
large
one
of
buffalo
skins
tatooed
with
the
mystic
totems
of
the
medicine
peculiar
to
the
nation
in

of
this
stood
the
grim
like
a
decayed
tree
trunk
its
bloody
fruit
tossing
in
the
wind
and
on
another
pole
at
a
few
feet
distance
was
hung
the
bag
with
its
mysterious
contents
before
each
lodge
a
tripod
of
spears
supported
the
arms
and
shields
of
the
yuta
chivalry
and
on
many
of
them
scalps
rattled
in
the
wind
former
trophies
of
the
dusky
knights
who
were
arming
themselves
within

a
very
small
fire
which
they
had
kindled
in
the
centre
of
the
open
space
and
when
a
thin
column
of
smoke
arose
one
of
them
planted
the
obliquely
across
the
fire
squaws
in
robes
of
white
dressed
buckskin
garnished
with
beads
and
porcupines
quills
and
their
faces
painted
bright
red
and
black
then
appeared
these
ranged
themselves
round
the
outside
of
the
square
the
boys
and
children
of
all
ages
mounted
on
horses
galloping
round
and
round
and
screaming
with
eagerness
excitement
and
curiosity
presently
the
braves
and
warriors
made
their
appearance
and
squatted
round
the
fire
in
two
circles
those
who
had
been
engaged
on
the
expedition
being
in
the
first
or
smaller
one
one
medicine
man
sat
under
the
having
a
drum
between
his
knees
which
he
tapped
at
intervals
with
his
hand
eliciting
from
the
instrument
a
hollow
monotonous
sound
a
bevy
of
women
shoulder
to
shoulder
then
advanced
from
the
four
sides
of
the
square
and
some
shaking
a
in
time
with
their
steps
commenced
a
jumping
jerking
dance
now
lifting
one
foot
from
the
ground
and
now
rising
with
both
accompanying
the
dance
with
a
chant
which
swelled
from
a
low
whisper
to
the
utmost
extent
of
their
dying
away
and
again
bursting
into
vociferous
measure
thus
they
advanced
to
the
centre
and
retreated
to
their
former
positions
when
six
squaws
with
their
faces
painted
a
dead
black
made
their
appearance
from
the
crowd
chanting
in
soft
and
sweet
measure
a
lament
for
the
braves
the
nation
had
lost
in
the
late
battle
but
soon
as
they
drew
near
the
their
melancholy
note
changed
to
the
music
to
them
of
gratified
revenge
in
a
succession
of
jumps
raising
the
feet
alternately
but
a
little
distance
from
the
ground
they
made
their
way
through
an
interval
left
in
the
circle
of
warriors
to
the
grim
pole
and
encircling
it
danced
in
perfect
silence
round
it
for
a
few
moments
then
they
burst
forth
with
an
extempore
song
laudatory
of
the
achievements
of
their
victorious
braves
they
addressed
the
scalps
as
sisters
to
be
called
a
squaw
is
the
greatest
insult
that
can
be
offered
to
an
indian
and
spitting
at
them
upbraided
them
with
their
rashness
in
leaving
their
lodges
to
seek
for
yuta
husbands
that
the
yuta
warriors
and
young
men
despised
them
and
chastised
them
for
their
forwardness
and
presumption
bringing
back
their
scalps
to
their
own
after
sufficiently
proving
that
they
had
any
thing
but
lost
the
use
of
their
tongues
but
possessed
on
the
contrary
as
fair
a
length
of
that
formidable
weapon
as
any
of
their
sex
they
withdrew
and
left
the
field
in
undisputed
possession
of
the
men
who
accompanied
by
tap
of
drum
and
by
the
noise
of
many
rattles
broke
out
into
a
in
which
their
own
valour
was
by
no
means
hidden
in
a
bushel
or
modestly
refused
the
light
of
day
after
this
came
the
more
interesting
ceremony
of
a
warrior
counting
his
a
young
brave
with
his
face
painted
black
mounted
on
a
white
horse
mysteriously
marked
with
red
clay
and
naked
to
the
holding
in
his
hand
a
long
taper
lance
rode
into
the
circle
and
paced
slowly
round
it
then
flourishing
his
spear
on
high
he
darted
to
the
round
which
the
warriors
were
now
seated
in
a
semicircle
and
in
a
loud
voice
and
with
furious
gesticulations
related
his
exploits
the
drums
tapping
at
the
conclusion
of
each
on
his
spear
hung
seven
scalps
and
holding
it
vertically
above
his
head
and
commencing
with
the
top
one
he
told
the
feats
in
which
he
had
raised
the
trophy
hair
when
he
had
run
through
these
the
drums
tapped
loudly
and
several
of
the
old
chiefs
shook
their
rattles
in
corroboration
of
the
truth
of
his
achievements
the
brave
swelling
with
pride
then
pointed
to
the
fresh
and
bloody
scalps
hanging
on
the
pole
two
of
these
had
been
torn
from
the
heads
of
rapahos
struck
by
his
own
hand
and
this
feat
exploit
of
the
day
had
entitled
him
to
the
honour
of
counting
his
coups
then
sticking
his
spear
into
the
ground
by
the
side
of
the
pole
he
struck
his
hand
twice
on
his
brawny
and
naked
chest
turned
short
round
and
swift
as
the
antelope
galloped
into
the
plain
as
if
overcome
by
the
shock
his
modesty
had
received
in
being
obliged
to
recount
his
own
deeds
wagh
exclaimed
old
killbuck
as
he
left
the
circle
pointing
his
towards
the
figure
of
the
brave
that
heart
about
as
big
as
ever
it
will
be
i
with
the
yutas
killbuck
and
la
bonté
remained
during
the
winter
and
when
the
spring
sun
had
opened
the
creeks
and
melted
the
snow
on
the
mountains
and
its
genial
warmth
had
expanded
the
earth
and
permitted
the
roots
of
the
grass
to
live
once
more
and
throw
out
green
and
tender
shoots
the
two
trappers
bade
adieu
to
the
hospitable
indians
who
broke
up
their
village
in
order
to
start
for
the
valleys
of
the
del
norte
as
they
followed
the
trail
from
the
bayou
at
sundown
just
as
they
thought
of
camping
they
observed
ahead
of
them
a
solitary
horseman
riding
along
followed
by
three
mules
his
of
fringed
buckskin
and
the
rifle
resting
across
the
horn
of
his
saddle
at
once
proclaimed
him
white
but
as
he
saw
the
mountaineers
winding
through
the
cañon
driving
before
them
half
a
dozen
horses
judged
they
might
possibly
be
indians
and
enemies
the
more
so
as
their
dress
was
not
the
usual
costume
of
the
whites
the
trappers
therefore
saw
the
stranger
raise
the
rifle
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
and
gathering
up
his
horse
ride
steadily
to
meet
them
as
soon
as
he
observed
they
were
but
two
two
to
one
in
mountain
calculation
being
scarcely
considered
odds
if
red
skin
to
white
however
on
nearing
them
the
stranger
discovered
his
mistake
and
throwing
his
rifle
across
the
saddle
once
more
reined
in
his
horse
and
waited
their
approach
for
the
spot
where
he
then
stood
presented
an
excellent
with
abundance
of
dry
wood
and
convenient
water

now
let
whilst
unpacking
their
own
animals
the
two
trappers
could
not
refrain
from
glancing
every
now
and
then
with
no
little
astonishment
at
the
solitary
stranger
they
had
so
unexpectedly
encountered
if
truth
be
told
his
appearance
not
a
little
perplexed
them
his
of
buckskin
shining
with
grease
and
fringed
pantaloons
over
which
the
had
evidently
been
often
wiped
after
cutting
his
food
or
butchering
the
carcass
of
deer
and
buffalo
were
of
genuine
mountain
make
his
face
clean
shaved
exhibited
in
its
and
complexion
the
effects
of
such
natural
cosmetics
as
sun
and
wind
and
under
the
mountain
hat
of
felt
which
covered
his
head
long
uncut
hair
hung
in
indian
fashion
on
his
shoulders
all
this
would
have
passed
muster
had
it
not
been
for
the
most
extraordinary
equipment
of
a
rifle
which
when
it
had
attracted
the
eyes
of
the
mountaineers
elicited
no
little
astonishment
not
to
say
derision
but
perhaps
nothing
excited
their
admiration
so
much
as
the
perfect
docility
of
the
stranger
animals
which
almost
like
dogs
obeyed
his
voice
and
call
and
albeit
that
one
in
a
small
sharp
head
and
pointed
ears
expanded
nostrils
and
eye
twinkling
and
malicious
exhibited
the
personification
of
a
lurking
devil
yet
they
could
not
but
admire
the
perfect
ease
with
which
even
this
one
in
common
with
the
rest
permitted
herself
to
be
handled
dismounting
and
unhitching
from
the
horn
of
his
saddle
the
coil
of
skin
rope
one
end
of
which
was
secured
round
the
neck
of
the
horse
he
proceeded
to
unsaddle
and
whilst
so
engaged
the
three
mules
two
of
which
were
packed
one
with
the
unbutchered
carcass
of
a
deer
the
other
with
a
pack
of
skins
followed
leisurely
into
the
space
chosen
for
the
camp
and
cropping
the
grass
at
their
ease
waited
until
a
whistle
called
them
to
be
unpacked
the
horse
was
a
strong
bay
and
although
the
severities
of
a
prolonged
winter
with
scanty
pasture
and
long
and
trying
travel
had
robbed
his
bones
of
fat
and
flesh
tucked
up
his
flank
and
ewed
his
neck
still
his
clean
and
legs
oblique
shoulder
and
withers
fine
as
a
deer
in
spite
of
his
gaunt
appearance
bore
ample
testimony
as
to
what
he
been
while
his
clear
cheerful
eye
and
the
hearty
appetite
with
which
he
fell
to
work
on
the
coarse
grass
of
the
bottom
proved
that
he
had
something
in
him
still
and
was
game
as
ever
his
tail
gnawed
by
the
mules
in
days
of
strait
attracted
the
observant
mountaineers
hard
doins
when
it
come
to
that
remarked
la
bonté
between
the
horse
and
two
of
the
mules
a
mutual
and
great
affection
appeared
to
subsist
which
was
no
more
than
natural
when
their
master
observed
to
his
companions
that
they
had
travelled
together
upwards
of
two
thousand
miles
one
of
these
mules
was
a
short
stumpy
animal
with
an
enormous
head
surmounted
by
proportionable
ears
and
a
pair
of
unusually
large
eyes
beaming
the
most
perfect
good
temper
and
docility
most
uncommon
qualities
in
a
mule
her
neck
was
thick
and
rendered
more
so
in
appearance
by
reason
of
her
mane
not
being
roached
or
in
english
hogged
which
privilege
she
alone
enjoyed
of
the
trio
and
her
short
strong
legs
ending
in
small
round
hoofs
were
feathered
with
a
profusion
of
dark
brown
hair
as
she
stood
whilst
the
stranger
removed
the
awkwardly
packed
deer
from
her
back
she
flapped
her
huge
ears
backward
and
forward
occasionally
turning
her
head
and
laying
her
cold
nose
against
her
master
cheek
when
the
pack
was
removed
he
advanced
to
her
head
and
resting
it
on
his
shoulder
rubbed
her
broad
and
grizzled
cheeks
with
both
his
hands
for
several
minutes
the
old
mule
laying
her
ears
like
a
rabbit
back
upon
her
neck
and
with
eyes
enjoyed
mightily
the
manipulation
then
giving
her
a
smack
upon
the
haunch
and
a
well
known
to
the
mule
kind
the
old
favourite
threw
up
her
heels
and
cantered
off
to
the
horse
who
was
busily
cropping
the
buffalo
grass
on
the
bluff
above
the
stream
great
was
the
contrast
between
the
one
just
described
and
the
next
which
came
up
to
be
divested
of
her
pack
she
a
tall
beautifully
shaped
mexican
mule
of
a
light
mouse
colour
with
a
head
like
a
deer
and
long
springy
legs
trotted
up
obedient
to
the
call
but
with
ears
bent
back
and
curled
up
nose
and
tail
compressed
between
her
legs
as
her
pack
was
being
removed
she
groaned
and
whined
like
a
dog
as
a
thong
or
loosened
strap
touched
her
ticklish
body
lifting
her
in
a
succession
of
jumps
or
preparatory
kicks
and
looking
wicked
as
a
panther
when
nothing
but
the
fore
remained
she
had
worked
herself
into
the
last
stage
and
as
the
stranger
cast
loose
the
girth
of
buffalo
hide
and
was
about
to
lift
the
saddle
and
draw
the
crupper
from
the
tail
she
drew
her
hind
legs
under
her
more
tightly
compressed
her
tail
and
almost
shrieked
with
rage
stand
clear
he
roared
knowing
what
was
coming
and
raised
the
saddle
when
out
went
her
hind
legs
up
went
the
pack
into
the
air
and
with
it
dangling
at
her
heels
away
she
tore
kicking
the
offending
saddle
as
she
ran
her
master
however
took
this
as
matter
of
course
followed
her
and
brought
back
the
saddle
which
he
piled
on
the
others
to
windward
of
the
fire
one
of
the
trappers
was
kindling
is
a
simple
process
with
the
mountaineers
their
always
contain
a
flint
and
steel
and
sundry
pieces
of
punk
or
tinder
and
pulling
a
handful
of
dry
grass
which
they
screw
into
a
nest
they
place
the
lighted
punk
in
this
and
closing
the
grass
over
it
wave
it
in
the
air
when
it
soon
ignites
and
readily
kindles
the
dry
sticks
forming
the
foundation
of
the
fire
the
of
the
deer
the
stranger
had
brought
in
were
soon
roasting
over
the
fire
whilst
as
soon
as
the
burning
logs
had
deposited
a
sufficiency
of
ashes
a
hole
was
raked
in
them
and
the
head
of
the
deer
skin
hair
and
all
placed
in
this
primitive
oven
and
carefully
covered
with
the
hot
ashes
a
heap
of
fat
meat
in
perspective
our
mountaineers
enjoyed
their
pipes
recounting
the
news
of
the
respective
regions
whence
they
came
and
so
well
did
they
like
each
other
company
so
sweet
was
the
tobacco
of
which
the
strange
hunter
had
good
store
so
plentiful
the
game
about
the
creek
and
so
abundant
the
pasture
for
their
animals
that
before
the
carcass
of
the
buck
had
been
more
than
consumed
and
although
rib
after
rib
had
been
picked
and
chucked
over
their
shoulders
to
the
wolves
and
one
fore
leg
and
bit
of
all
the
head
were
still
cooked
before
them
three
had
come
to
the
resolution
to
join
company
and
hunt
in
their
present
locality
for
a
few
days
at
owner
of
the
gun
volunteering
to
fill
their
horns
with
powder
and
find
tobacco
for
their
pipes
here
on
plenty
of
meat
of
venison
bear
and
antelope
they
merrily
luxuriated
returning
after
their
daily
hunts
to
the
brightly
burning
where
one
always
remained
to
guard
the
animals
and
unloading
their
packs
of
meat
all
choicest
portions
ate
late
into
the
night
and
smoking
wiled
away
the
time
in
narrating
scenes
in
their
lives
and
fighting
their
battles
again
the
younger
of
the
trappers
he
who
has
figured
under
the
name
of
la
bonté
had
excited
by
scraps
and
patches
from
his
history
no
little
curiosity
in
the
stranger
mind
to
learn
the
ups
and
downs
of
his
career
and
one
night
when
they
assembled
earlier
than
usual
at
the
fire
he
prevailed
upon
the
modest
trapper
to
unpack
some
passages
in
his
wild
adventurous
life
maybe
commenced
the
mountaineer
you
both
remember
when
old
ashley
went
out
with
the
biggest
kind
of
band
to
trap
the
columbia
and
of
missoura
and
yellow
stone
well
that
was
the
time
this
niggur
first
felt
like
taking
to
the
this
brings
us
back
to
the
year
of
our
lord
and
perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
in
order
to
render
la
bonté
mountain
language
intelligible
to
translate
it
at
once
into
tolerable
english
and
to
tell
in
the
third
person
but
from
his
own
lips
the
scrapes
which
befell
him
in
a
sojourn
of
more
than
twenty
years
in
the
far
west
and
the
causes
that
impelled
him
to
quit
the
comfort
and
civilisation
of
his
home
to
seek
the
perilous
but
engaging
life
of
a
trapper
of
the
rocky

in
the
state
of
mississippi
not
far
from
memphis
on
the
left
bank
of
that
huge
and
river
his
father
was
a
saint

frenchman
his
mother
a
native
of
tennessee
when
a
boy
our
trapper
was
some
he
said
with
the
rifle
and
always
had
a
hankering
for
the
west
particularly
when
on
accompanying
his
father
to
saint
louis
every
spring
he
saw
the
different
bands
of
traders
and
hunters
start
upon
their
annual
expeditions
to
the
mountains
greatly
did
he
envy
the
independent
trappers
as
in
all
the
glory
of
beads
and
buckskin
they
shouldered
their
rifles
at
jake
hawkin
door
the
of
st
louis
and
bade
adieu
to
the
cares
and
trammels
of
civilised
life
however
like
a
thoughtless
he
put
his
foot
into
a
trap
one
fine
day
set
by
mary

a
neighbour
daughter
and
esteemed
some
punkins
or
in
other
words
toasted
as
the
beauty
of
memphis
county
by
the
susceptible
mississippians
from
that
moment
he
was
gone
beaver
he
felt
queer
he
said
all
over
like
a
buffalo
shot
in
the
lights
he
had
no
relish
for
mush
and
molasses
homminy
and
johnny
cakes
failed
to
excite
his

ran
by
him
unscathed
he
did
know
he
said
whether
his

had
or
not
he
felt
bad
that
was
a
fact

what
ailed
him
he
did

his

throbbed
it
when
he
lay
down
to

spoke
it
plainly
when
he
cocked
it
to
raise
a
shaking
sight
at
a
deer
mary

mary

the

it
instead
of
her

the
croaked
it
in
the
swamp
and
mosquitoes
droned
it
in
his
ear
as
he
tossed
about
his
bed
at
night
wakeful
and
striving
to
think
what
ailed
him
who
could
that
strapping
young
fellow
who
passed
the
door
just
now
be
going
to
see
mary

mary

and
who
can
big

be
dressing
that

so
carefully
for
for
whom
but
mary

and
who
is
it
that
jokes
and
laughs
and
dances
with
all
the

but
him
and
why
who
but
mary

and
because
the
booby
carefully
avoids
her
and
mary

is
she
like
she
now
that
a
fact
and
the
biggest
kind
of
punkin
at
that
would
have
been
the
answer
from
any
man
woman
or
child
in
memphis
county
and
truly
spoken
too
always
understanding
that
the
pumpkin
is
the
fruit
by
which
the
of
female
perfection
is
expressed
amongst
the
westerns
being
an
american
woman
of
course
she
was
tall
and
straight
and
slim
as
a
hickory
sapling
well
formed
withal
with
rounded
bust
and
neck
white
and
slender
as
the
swan
her
features
were
small
but
finely
chiselled
and
in
this
it
may
be
remarked
the
lower
orders
of
the
american
women
differ
from
and
far
surpass
the
same
class
in
england
or
elsewhere
where
the
features
although
far
prettier
are
more
vulgar
and
commonplace
mary
brand
had
the
bright
blue
eye
thin
nose
and
small
but
mouth
the
too
fair
complexion
and
dark
brown
hair
which
characterise
the
beauty
of
the
the
heavy
masses
hardly
curls
that
fell
over
her
face
and
neck
contrasting
with
their
polished
whiteness
such
was
mary
brand
and
when
to
her
good
looks
are
added
a
sweet
disposition
and
all
the
best
qualities
of
a
thrifty
housewife
it
must
be
allowed
that
she
fully
justified
the
eulogiums
of
the
good
people
of
memphis
well
to
cut
a
short
in
doing
which
not
a
little
moral
courage
is
shown
young
la
bonté
fell
desperately
in
love
with
the
pretty
mary
and
she
with
him
and
small
blame
to
her
for
he
was
a
proper
lad
of
feet
in
his
best
hunter
and
in
the
country
with
many
other
advantages
too
numerous
to
mention
but
when
did
the
course
run
smooth
when
the
affair
had
become
a
recognised
courting
and
americans
alone
know
the
horrors
of
such
prolonged
purgatory
they
became
to
use
la
words
awful
fond
and
consequently
about
once
had
their
tiffs
and
however
on
one
occasion
at
a
husking
and
during
one
of
these
tiffs
mary
every
inch
a
woman
to
gratify
some
indescribable
feeling
brought
to
her
aid
old
serpent
who
has
caused
such
mischief
in
this
world
and
by
a
flirtation
over
the
with
big
pete
la
bonté
former
and
only
rival
struck
so
hard
a
blow
at
the
latter
heart
that
on
the
moment
his
brain
caught
fire
blood
danced
before
his
eyes
and
he
became
like
one
possessed
pete
observed
and
enjoyed
his
struggling
for
him
had
he
minded
his
alone
the
more
to
annoy
his
rival
paid
the
most
sedulous
attention
to
pretty
mary
young
la
bonté
stood
it
as
long
as
human
nature
at
boiling
heat
could
endure
but
when
pete
in
the
exultation
of
his
apparent
triumph
crowned
his
success
by
encircling
the
slender
waist
of
the
girl
with
his
arm
and
snatching
a
sudden
kiss
he
jumped
upright
from
his
seat
and
seizing
a
small
which
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
he
hurled
it
at
his
rival
and
crying
to
him
hoarse
with
passion
to
follow
if
he
was
a
man
he
left
the
house
at
that
time
and
even
now
in
the
remoter
states
of
the
western
country
rifles
settled
even
the
most
trivial
differences
between
the
youths
and
of
such
frequent
occurrence
and
invariably
bloody
termination
did
these
encounters
become
that
they
scarcely
produced
sufficient
excitement
to
draw
together
spectators
in
the
present
case
however
so
public
was
the
quarrel
and
so
well
known
the
parties
concerned
that
not
only
the
people
who
had
witnessed
the
affair
but
all
the
neighbourhood
thronged
to
the
scene
of
action
in
a
large
field
in
front
of
the
house
where
the
preliminaries
of
a
duel
between
pete
and
la
bonté
were
being
arranged
by
their
respective
friends
mary
when
she
discovered
the
mischief
her
thoughtlessness
was
likely
to
occasion
was
almost
beside
herself
with
grief
but
she
knew
how
vain
it
would
be
to
attempt
to
interfere
the
poor
girl
who
was
most
ardently
attached
to
la
bonté
was
carried
swooning
into
the
house
where
all
the
women
congregated
and
were
locked
in
by
old
brand
who
himself
an
old
pioneer
thought
but
little
of
bloodshed
but
refused
to
let
the
women
folk
witness
the
affray
preliminaries
arranged
the
combatants
took
up
their
respective
positions
at
either
end
of
a
space
marked
for
the
purpose
at
forty
paces
from
each
other
they
were
both
armed
with
heavy
rifles
and
had
the
usual
containing
ammunition
hanging
over
the
shoulder
standing
with
the
butts
of
their
rifles
on
the
ground
they
confronted
each
other
and
the
crowd
drawing
away
a
few
paces
only
on
each
side
left
one
man
to
give
the
word
this
was
the
single
word
fire
and
after
this
signal
was
given
the
combatants
were
at
liberty
to
fire
away
until
one
or
the
other
dropped
at
the
word
both
the
men
quickly
raised
their
rifles
to
the
shoulder
and
whilst
the
sharp
cracks
instantaneously
rang
they
were
seen
to
flinch
as
either
felt
the
pinging
sensation
of
a
bullet
entering
his
flesh
regarding
each
other
steadily
for
a
few
moments
the
blood
running
down
la
bonté
neck
from
a
wound
under
the
left
jaw
whilst
his
opponent
was
seen
to
place
his
hand
once
to
his
right
breast
as
if
to
feel
the
position
of
his
wound
they
commenced
reloading
their
rifles
but
as
pete
was
in
the
act
of
forcing
down
the
ball
with
his
long
hickory
he
suddenly
dropped
his
right
rifle
slipped
from
his
reeling
for
a
moment
like
a
drunken
fell
dead
to
the
ground
even
here
however
there
was
law
of
some
kind
or
another
and
the
consequences
of
the
duel
were
that
the
constables
were
soon
on
the
trail
of
la
bonté
to
arrest
him
he
easily
avoided
them
and
taking
to
the
woods
lived
for
several
days
in
as
wild
a
state
as
the
beasts
he
hunted
and
killed
for
his
support
tired
of
this
he
at
last
resolved
to
quit
the
country
and
betake
himself
to
the
mountains
for
which
life
he
had
ever
felt
an
inclination
when
therefore
he
thought
the
officers
of
justice
had
grown
slack
in
their
search
of
him
and
that
the
coast
was
comparatively
clear
he
determined
to
start
on
his
distant
expedition
to
the
far
west
once
more
before
he
carried
his
project
into
execution
he
sought
and
obtained
a
last
interview
with
mary
brand
mary
said
he
i
about
to
break
they
hunting
me
like
a
fall
buck
and
i
bound
to
quit
do
think
any
more
about
me
for
i
shall
never
come
poor
mary
burst
into
tears
and
bent
her
head
on
the
table
near
which
she
sat
when
she
again
raised
it
she
saw
la
bonté
his
long
rifle
upon
his
shoulder
striding
with
rapid
steps
from
the
house
year
after
year
rolled
on
and
he
did
not
return
chapter
iii
a
few
days
after
his
departure
la
bonté
found
himself
at
st
louis
the
emporium
of
the
fur
trade
and
the
metropolis
of
the
precocious
settlements
of
the
west
here
a
prey
to
the
agony
of
mind
which
jealousy
remorse
and
blighted
love
mix
into
a
very
puchero
of
misery
he
got
into
the
company
of
certain
rowdies
a
class
that
every
western
city
particularly
abounds
in
and
anxious
to
drown
his
sorrows
in
any
way
and
quite
unscrupulous
as
to
the
means
he
plunged
into
all
the
vicious
excitements
of
drinking
gambling
and
fighting
which
form
the
amusements
of
the
rising
generation
of
st
louis
perhaps
in
no
other
part
of
the
united
states
where
indeed
humanity
is
frequently
to
be
seen
in
many
curious
and
unusual
phases
is
there
a
population
so
marked
in
its
general
character
and
at
the
same
time
divided
into
such
distinct
classes
as
in
the
city
dating
as
it
does
its
foundation
from
what
are
thirty
years
in
the
growth
of
a
metropolis
founders
are
now
scarcely
passed
middle
life
regarding
with
astonishment
the
growing
works
of
their
hands
and
whilst
gazing
upon
its
busy
quays
piled
with
grain
and
other
produce
of
the
west
its
fleets
of
huge
steamboats
lying
tier
upon
tier
alongside
the
wharves
its
warehouses
and
all
the
bustling
concomitants
of
a
great
commercial
depôt
they
can
scarcely
realise
the
memory
of
a
few
short
years
when
on
the
same
spot
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
miserable
hovels
of
a
french
only
sign
of
commerce
being
the
unwieldy
bateaux
of
the
indian
traders
laden
with
peltries
from
the
distant
regions
of
the
platte
and
upper
missouri
where
now
intelligent
and
wealthy
merchants
walk
erect
in
conscious
substantiality
of
purse
and
credit
and
direct
the
commerce
of
a
vast
and
region
there
stalked
but
the
other
day
in
dress
of
buckskin
the
indian
trader
of
the
west
and
all
the
evidences
of
life
mayhap
consisted
of
the
eccentric
vagaries
of
the
different
bands
of
trappers
and
hardy
mountaineers
who
accompanied
some
for
pleasure
and
some
as
escort
the
periodically
arriving
bateaux
laden
with
the
beaver
skins
and
buffalo
robes
collected
during
the
season
at
the
different
trading
posts
in
the
far
west
these
nevertheless
were
the
men
whose
hardy
enterprise
opened
to
commerce
and
the
plough
the
vast
and
fertile
regions
of
the
west
rough
and
savage
though
they
were
they
were
the
true
pioneers
of
that
extraordinary
tide
of
civilisation
which
has
poured
its
resistless
current
through
tracts
large
enough
for
kings
to
govern
over
a
country
now
teeming
with
cultivation
where
a
few
short
years
ago
countless
herds
of
buffalo
roamed
unmolested
where
the
bear
and
deer
abounded
and
the
savage
indian
skulked
through
the
woods
and
prairies
lord
of
the
unappreciated
soil
that
now
yields
its
prolific
treasures
to
the
spade
and
plough
of
civilised
man
to
the
wild
and
trapper
who
may
be
said
to
exemplify
the
energy
enterprise
and
hardihood
characteristic
of
the
american
people
divested
of
all
the
false
and
vicious
glare
with
which
a
high
state
of
civilisation
too
rapidly
attained
has
obscured
their
real
and
genuine
character
in
which
the
above
traits
are
eminently
these
men
alone
is
due
the
empire
of
the
in
a
few
short
years
to
become
the
most
important
of
those
confederate
states
composing
the
mighty
union
of
north
america
sprung
then
out
of
the
wild
and
adventurous
fur
trade
st
louis
still
the
emporium
of
that
species
of
commerce
preserves
even
now
in
the
character
of
its
population
many
of
the
marked
peculiarities
distinguishing
its
early
founders
who
were
identified
with
the
primitive
indian
in
hardihood
and
instinctive
wisdom
whilst
the
french
portion
of
the
population
retain
the
thoughtless
levity
and
frivolous
disposition
of
their
original
source
the
americans
of
st
louis
who
may
lay
claim
to
be
native
as
it
were
are
as
strongly
distinguished
for
determination
and
energy
of
character
as
they
are
for
physical
strength
and
animal
courage
and
are
remarkable
at
the
same
time
for
a
singular
aptitude
in
carrying
out
commercial
enterprises
to
successful
terminations
apparently
incompatible
with
the
thirst
of
adventure
and
excitement
which
forms
so
prominent
a
feature
in
their
character
in
st
louis
and
with
her
merchants
have
originated
many
commercial
enterprises
of
gigantic
speculation
not
confined
to
the
immediate
locality
or
to
the
distant
indian
fur
trade
but
embracing
all
parts
of
the
continent
and
even
a
portion
of
the
old
world
and
here
it
must
be
remembered
that
st
louis
is
situated
inland
at
a
distance
of
upwards
of
one
thousand
miles
from
the
sea
and
three
thousand
from
the
capital
of
the
united
states
besides
her
merchants
and
upper
class
who
form
a
little
aristocracy
even
here
a
large
portion
of
her
population
still
connected
with
the
indian
and
fur
trade
preserve
all
their
original
characteristics
unacted
upon
by
the
influence
of
advancing
civilisation
there
is
moreover
a
large
floating
population
of
foreigners
of
all
nations
who
must
possess
no
little
amount
of
enterprise
to
be
tempted
to
this
spot
whence
they
spread
over
the
remote
western
tracts
still
infested
by
the
savage
so
that
if
any
of
their
blood
is
infused
into
the
native
population
the
characteristic
energy
and
enterprise
is
increased
and
not
tempered
down
by
the
foreign
cross
but
perhaps
the
most
singular
of
the
casual
population
are
the
mountaineers
who
after
several
seasons
spent
in
trapping
and
with
good
store
of
dollars
arrive
from
the
scene
of
their
adventures
wild
as
savages
determined
to
enjoy
themselves
for
a
time
in
all
the
gaiety
and
dissipation
of
the
western
city

one
of
the
back
streets
of
the
town

a
tavern
well
known
as
the
house
and
hither
the
trappers
resort
drinking
and
fighting
as
long
as
their
money
lasts
which
as
they
are
generous
and
lavish
as
jack
tars
is
for
a
few
days
only
such
scenes
both
tragic
and
comic
as
are
enacted
in
the
house
are
beyond
the
powers
of
pen
to
describe
and
when
a
fandango
is
in
progress
to
which
congregate
the
coquettish
belles
from

the
french
portion
of

endeavours
of
the
mountaineers
to
sport
a

of
terpsichorean
indians

in
the

in

of

such
startling
innovations
on
the

of

upon

by
the

with

to

when
it
comes
to
that
ware
la
bonté
on
his
arrival
at
st
louis
found
himself
one
day
in
no
less
a
place
than
this
and
here
he
made
acquaintance
with
an
old
trapper
about
to
start
for
the
mountains
in
a
few
days
to
hunt
on
the
head
waters
of
platte
and
green
river
with
this
man
he
resolved
to
start
and
having
still
some
hundred
dollars
in
cash
he
immediately
set
about
equipping
himself
for
the
expedition
to
effect
this
he
first
of
all
visited
the
of
hawken
whose
rifles
are
renowned
in
the
mountains
and
exchanged
his
own
piece
which
was
of
very
small
bore
for
a
regular
mountain
rifle
this
was
of
very
heavy
metal
carrying
about
balls
to
the
pound
stocked
to
the
muzzle
and
mounted
with
brass
its
only
ornament
being
a
buffalo
bull
looking
exceedingly
ferocious
which
was
not
very
artistically
engraved
upon
the
trap
in
the
stock
here
too
he
laid
in
a
few
pounds
of
powder
and
lead
and
all
the
necessaries
for
a
long
hunt
his
next
visit
was
to
a
smith
store
which
smith
was
black
by
trade
and
black
by
nature
for
he
was
a
nigger
and
moreover
celebrated
as
being
the
best
maker
of
in
st
louis
and
of
him
he
purchased
six
new
traps
paying
for
the
same
twenty
at
the
same
time
an
old
made
of
stout
buffalo
skin
in
which
to
carry
them
we
next
find
la

and
his

better
known
as
one
of
his

having
been
gouged
in
a
mountain
independence
a
little
town
situated
on
the
missouri
several
hundred
miles
above
st
louis
and
within
a
short
distance
of
the
indian
frontier
independence
may
be
termed
the
prairie
port
of
the
western
country
here
the
caravans
destined
for
santa

and
the
interior
of

assemble
to
complete
their
necessary
equipment
mules
and
oxen
are
purchased
teamsters
hired
and
all
stores
and
outfit
laid
in
here
for
the
long
journey
over
the
wide
expanse
of
prairie
ocean
here
too
the
indian
traders
and
the
trappers
rendezvous
collecting
in
sufficient
force
to
ensure
their
safe
passage
through
the
indian
country
at
the
seasons
of
departure
and
arrival
of
these
bands
the
little
town
presents
a
lively
scene
of
bustle
and
confusion
the
wild
and
dissipated
mountaineers
get
rid
of
their
last
dollars
in
furious
orgies
treating
all
comers
to
galore
of
drink
and
pledging
each
other
in
horns
of
potent
whisky
to
successful
hunts
and
heaps
of
when
every
cent
has
disappeared
from
their
pouches
the
free
trapper
often
makes
away
with
rifle
traps
and
animals
to
gratify
his
dry
for
your
mountaineer
is
never
thirsty
and
then
hos
and
beaver
gone
is
necessitated
to
hire
himself
to
one
of
the
leaders
of
big
bands
and
hypothecate
his
services
for
an
equipment
of
traps
and
animals
thus
la
bonté
picked
up
three
excellent
mules
for
a
mere
song
with
their
accompanying
and
lariats
and
the
next
day
with
luke
put
out
for
platte
as
they
passed
through
the
rendezvous
which
was
encamped
on
a
little
stream
beyond
the
town
even
our
young
mississippian
was
struck
with
the
novelty
of
the
scene
upwards
of
forty
huge
waggons
of
conostoga
and
pittsburg
build
and
covered
with
tilts
were
ranged
in
a
semicircle
or
rather
a
form
on
the
flat
open
prairie
their
long
tongues
poles
pointing
outwards
with
the
necessary
harness
for
four
pairs
of
mules
or
eight
yoke
of
oxen
lying
on
the
ground
beside
them
spread
in
ready
order
for
hitching
round
the
waggons
groups
of
teamsters
tall
stalwart
young
missourians
were
engaged
in
busy
preparation
for
the
start
greasing
the
wheels
fitting
or
repairing
harness
smoothing
or
overhauling
their
own
moderate
kits
or
they
were
all
dressed
in
the
same
fashion
a
pair
of
homespun
pantaloons
tucked
into
thick
boots
reaching
nearly
to
the
knee
and
confined
round
the
waist
by
a
broad
leathern
belt
which
supported
a
strong
in
a
sheath
a
coarse
checked
shirt
was
their
only
other
covering
with
a
fur
cap
on
the
head
numerous
surrounded
the
waggons
and
near
them
lounged
mountaineers
easily
distinguished
from
the
greenhorn
teamsters
by
their
dresses
of
buckskin
and
their
faces
without
an
exception
these
were
under
the
influence
of
the
rosy
god
and
one
who
sat
the
picture
of
misery
at
a
fire
by
into
the
blaze
with
vacant
countenance
his
long
matted
hair
hanging
in
unkempt
masses
over
his
face
begrimed
with
the
dirt
of
a
week
and
pallid
with
the
effects
of
ardent
suffering
from
the
usual
consequences
of
having
kept
it
up
beyond
the
usual
point
paying
the
penalty
in
a
fit
of
horrors
is
most
aptly
termed
by
sailors
and
the
unprofessional
in
another
part
the
merchants
of
the
caravan
and
the
indian
traders
superintended
the
lading
of
the
waggons
or
mule
packs
they
were
dressed
in
civilised
attire
and
some
were
even
bedizened
in
st
louis
or
eastern
city
dandyism
to
the
infinite
disgust
of
the
mountain
men
who
look
upon
a
bourgeois
with
most
undisguised
contempt
despising
the
very
simplest
forms
of
civilisation
the
picturesque
appearance
of
the
encampment
was
not
a
little
heightened
by
the
addition
of
several
indians
from
the
neighbouring
shawnee
settlement
who
mounted
on
their
small
active
horses
on
which
they
reclined
rather
than
sat
in
negligent
attitudes
quietly
looked
on
at
the
novel
scene
indifferent
to
the
chaff
in
which
the
thoughtless
teamsters
indulged
at
their
expense
numbers
of
mules
and
horses
were
picketed
at
hand
whilst
a
large
herd
of
noble
oxen
were
being
driven
towards
the
of
the
teamsters
sounding
far
and
near
as
they
collected
the
scattered
beasts
in
order
to
yoke
up
as
most
of
the
mountain
men
were
utterly
unable
to
move
from
camp
luke
and
la
bonté
with
three
or
four
of
the
most
sober
started
in
company
intending
to
wait
on
blue
a
stream
which
runs
into
the
caw
or
kanzas
river
until
the
balance
of
the
band
came
up
mounting
their
mules
and
leading
the
loose
animals
they
struck
at
once
into
the
prairie
and
were
speedily
out
of
sight
of
civilisation
it
was
the
latter
end
of
may
towards
the
close
of
the
season
of
heavy
rains
which
in
early
spring
render
the
climate
of
this
country
almost
intolerable
at
the
same
time
that
they
fertilise
and
thaw
the
soil
so
long
bound
up
by
the
winter
frosts
the
grass
was
every
where
luxuriantly
green
and
gaudy
flowers
dotted
the
surface
of
the
prairie
this
term
however
should
hardly
be
applied
to
the
beautiful
undulating
scenery
of
this
country
unlike
the
flat
monotony
of
the
grand
plains
here
well
wooded
uplands
clothed
with
forest
trees
of
every
species
and
picturesque
dells
through
which
run
clear
bubbling
streams
belted
with
shrubs
every
where
present
themselves
whilst
on
the
level
topes
of
trees
with
spreading
foliage
afford
a
shelter
to
the
game
and
cattle
and
knolls
rise
at
intervals
from
the
plain
many
clear
streams
dashing
over
their
pebbly
beds
intersect
the
country
from
which
in
the
heat
the
jump
shaking
their
wet
sides
as
the
noise
of
approaching
man
disturbs
them
and
booming
grouse
rise
from
the
tall
luxuriant
herbage
at
every
step
where
the
deep
escarpments
of
the
river
banks
exhibit
the
section
of
the
earth
a
rich
alluvial
soil
of
surpassing
depth
courts
the
cultivation
of
civilised
man
and
in
every
feature
it
is
evident
that
here
nature
has
worked
with
kindliest
and
most
bountiful
hand
for
hundreds
of
miles
along
the
western
or
right
bank
of
the
missouri
does
a
country
extend
with
which
for
fertility
and
natural
resources
no
part
of
europe
can
stand
comparison
sufficiently
large
to
contain
an
enormous
population
it
has
besides
every
advantage
of
position
and
all
the
natural
capabilities
which
should
make
it
the
happy
abode
of
civilised
man
through
this
unpeopled
country
the
united
states
pours
her
greedy
thousands
to
seize
upon
the
barren
territories
of
her
feeble
neighbour
camping
the
first
night
on
black
jack
our
mountaineers
here
cut
each
man
a
spare
hickory
for
his
rifle
and
la
bonté
who
was
the
only
greenhorn
of
the
party
witnessed
a
savage
ebullition
of
rage
on
the
part
of
one
of
his
companions
exhibiting
the
perfect
unrestraint
which
these
men
impose
upon
their
passions
and
the
barbarous
anger
which
the
slightest
opposition
to
their
will
excites
one
of
the
trappers
on
arriving
at
the
dismounted
from
his
horse
and
after
divesting
it
of
the
saddle
endeavoured
to
lead
his
mule
by
the
rope
up
to
the
spot
where
he
wished
to
deposit
his
pack
however
the
more
he
pulled
the
more
stubbornly
she
remained
in
her
tracks
planting
her
firmly
and
stretching
out
her
neck
with
provoking
obstinacy
truth
to
tell
it
does
require
the
temper
of
a
thousand
jobs
to
manage
a
mule
and
in
no
case
does
the
wilful
mulishness
of
the
animal
stir
up
one
choler
more
than
in
the
very
trick
this
one
played
and
which
is
a
daily
occurrence
after
tugging
ineffectually
for
several
minutes
winding
the
rope
round
his
body
and
throwing
himself
suddenly
forward
with
all
his
strength
the
trapper
actually
foamed
with
passion
and
although
he
might
have
subdued
the
animal
at
once
by
fastening
the
rope
with
a
round
its
nose
this
with
an
obstinacy
equal
to
that
of
the
mule
itself
he
refused
to
attempt
preferring
to
vanquish
her
by
main
strength
failing
so
to
do
the
mountaineer
with
a
volley
of
blasphemous
imprecations
suddenly
seized
his
rifle
and
levelling
it
at
the
mule
head
shot
her
dead
passing
the
a
stream
they
met
a
band
of
osages
going
to
these
indians
in
common
with
some
tribes
of
the
pawnees
shave
the
head
with
the
exception
of
a
ridge
from
the
forehead
to
the
centre
of
the
scalp
which
is
roached
or
hogged
like
the
mane
of
a
mule
and
stands
erect
plastered
with
unguents
and
ornamented
with
feathers
of
the
hawk
and
turkey
the
naked
scalp
is
often
painted
in
mosaic
with
black
and
red
the
face
with
shining
vermilion
this
band
were
all
naked
to
the
the
warmth
of
the
sun
having
made
them
throw
their
dirty
blankets
from
their
shoulders
these
indians
not
unfrequently
levy
contributions
on
the
strangers
they
accidentally
meet
but
they
easily
distinguish
the
determined
mountaineer
from
the
incautious
greenhorn
and
think
it
better
to
let
the
former
alone
crossing
vermilion
the
trappers
arrived
on
the
fifth
day
at
blue
where
they
encamped
in
the
broad
timber
belting
the
creek
and
there
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
remainder
of
the
party
it
was
two
days
before
they
came
up
but
the
following
day
they
started
for
the
mountains
fourteen
in
number
striking
a
trail
which
follows
the
big
blue
in
its
course
through
the
prairies
which
as
they
advanced
to
the
westward
gradually
smoothed
away
into
a
vast
unbroken
expanse
of
rolling
plain
herds
of
antelope
began
to
show
themselves
and
some
of
the
hunters
leaving
the
trail
soon
returned
with
plenty
of
their
tender
meat
the
luxuriant
but
coarse
grass
they
had
hitherto
seen
now
changed
into
the
nutritious
and
curly
buffalo
grass
and
their
animals
soon
improved
in
appearance
on
the
excellent
pasture
in
a
few
days
without
any
adventure
they
struck
the
platte
river
its
shallow
waters
from
which
it
derives
its
name
spreading
over
a
wide
and
sandy
bed
numerous
sand
bars
obstructing
the
sluggish
current
nowhere
sufficiently
deep
to
wet
the
forder
knee
by
this
time
but
few
antelope
having
been
seen
the
party
ran
entirely
out
of
meat
and
one
whole
day
and
part
of
another
having
passed
without
so
much
as
a
stray
rabbit
presenting
itself
not
a
few
objurgations
on
the
buffalo
grumbled
from
the
lips
of
the
hunters
who
expected
ere
this
to
have
reached
the
land
of
plenty
la
bonté
killed
a
fine
deer
however
in
the
river
bottom
after
they
had
encamped
not
one
particle
of
which
remained
after
supper
that
night
but
which
hardly
took
the
rough
edge
off
their
keen
appetites
although
already
in
the
buffalo
range
no
traces
of
these
animals
had
yet
been
seen
and
as
the
country
afforded
but
little
game
and
the
party
did
not
care
to
halt
and
lose
time
in
hunting
for
it
they
moved
along
hungry
and
sulky
the
theme
of
conversation
being
the
well
remembered
merits
of
good
buffalo
meat
fat
fleece
hump
rib
and
tender
loin
of
delicious
boudins
and
marrow
bones
too
good
to
think
of
la
bonté
had
never
seen
the
lordly
animal
and
consequently
but
half
believed
the
accounts
of
the
mountaineers
who
described
their
countless
bands
as
covering
the
prairie
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
requiring
days
of
travel
to
pass
through
but
the
visions
of
such
dainty
and
abundant
feeding
as
they
descanted
on
set
his
mouth
watering
and
danced
before
his
eyes
as
he
slept
supperless
night
after
night
on
the
banks
of
the
hungry
platte
one
morning
he
had
packed
his
animals
before
the
rest
and
was
riding
a
mile
in
advance
of
the
party
when
he
saw
on
one
side
the
trail
looming
in
the
refracted
glare
which
mirages
the
plains
three
large
dark
objects
without
shape
or
form
which
rose
and
fell
in
the
exaggerated
light
like
ships
at
sea
doubting
what
it
could
be
he
approached
the
strange
objects
and
as
the
refraction
disappeared
before
him
the
dark
masses
assumed
a
more
distinct
form
and
clearly
moved
with
life
a
little
nearer
and
he
made
them
were
buffalo
thinking
to
distinguish
himself
the
greenhorn
dismounted
from
his
mule
and
quickly
hobbled
her
throwing
his
lasso
on
the
ground
to
trail
behind
when
he
wished
to
catch
her
then
rifle
in
hand
he
approached
the
huge
animals
and
being
a
good
hunter
knew
well
to
take
advantage
of
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
and
face
the
wind
by
which
means
he
crawled
at
length
to
within
forty
yards
of
the
buffalo
which
quietly
cropped
the
grass
unconscious
of
danger
now
for
the
first
time
he
gazed
upon
the
noble
beast
he
had
so
often
heard
of
and
longed
to
see
with
beard
sweeping
the
ground
as
he
fed
an
enormous
bull
was
in
advance
of
the
others
his
wild
brilliant
eyes
peering
from
an
immense
mass
of
shaggy
hair
which
covered
his
neck
and
shoulder
from
this
point
his
skin
was
smooth
as
one
hand
a
sleek
and
shining
dun
and
his
ribs
were
well
covered
with
shaking
flesh
whilst
leisurely
cropping
the
short
curly
grass
he
occasionally
lifted
his
tail
into
the
air
and
stamped
his
foot
as
a
fly
or
musquito
annoyed
the
intruder
with
his
tail
or
snatching
at
the
itching
part
with
his
ponderous
head
when
la
bonté
had
sufficiently
admired
the
buffalo
he
lifted
his
rifle
and
taking
steady
aim
and
certain
of
his
mark
pulled
the
trigger
expecting
to
see
the
huge
beast
fall
over
at
the
report
what
was
his
surprise
and
consternation
however
to
see
the
animal
only
flinch
when
the
ball
struck
him
and
then
gallop
off
followed
by
the
others
apparently
unhurt
as
is
generally
the
case
with
greenhorns
he
had
fired
too
high
ignorant
that
the
only
certain
spot
to
strike
a
buffalo
is
but
a
few
inches
above
the
brisket
and
that
a
higher
shot
is
rarely
fatal
when
he
rose
from
the
ground
he
saw
all
the
party
halting
in
full
view
of
his
discomfiture
and
when
he
joined
them
loud
were
the
laughs
and
deep
the
regrets
of
the
hungry
at
his
first
attempt
however
they
now
knew
that
they
were
in
the
country
of
meat
and
a
few
miles
farther
another
band
of
stragglers
presenting
themselves
three
of
the
hunters
went
in
pursuit
la
bonté
taking
a
mule
to
pack
in
the
meat
he
soon
saw
them
crawling
towards
the
band
and
shortly
two
puffs
of
smoke
and
the
sharp
cracks
of
their
rifles
showed
that
they
had
got
within
shot
and
when
he
rode
up
two
fine
buffaloes
were
stretched
upon
the
ground
now
for
the
first
time
he
was
initiated
in
the
mysteries
of
he
watched
the
hunters
as
they
turned
the
carcass
on
the
belly
stretching
out
the
legs
to
support
it
on
each
side
a
transverse
cut
was
then
made
at
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
gathering
the
long
hair
of
the
boss
in
one
hand
the
skin
was
separated
from
the
shoulder
it
was
then
laid
open
from
this
point
to
the
tail
along
the
spine
and
then
freed
from
the
sides
and
pulled
down
to
the
brisket
but
still
attached
to
it
was
stretched
upon
the
ground
to
receive
the
dissected
portions
then
the
shoulder
was
severed
the
fleece
removed
from
along
the
backbone
and
the
cut
off
with
a
tomahawk
all
this
was
placed
upon
the
skin
and
after
the
boudins
had
been
withdrawn
from
the
stomach
and
the
great
from
the
head
the
meat
was
packed
upon
the
mule
and
the
whole
party
hurried
to
camp
rejoicing
there
was
in
the
camp
that
night
and
the
way
they
indulged
their
in
their
own
language
throw
the
meat
cold
have
made
the
heart
of
a
dyspeptic
leap
for
joy
or
burst
with
envy
far
into
the
still
watches
of
the
tranquil
night
the
depouille
saw
its
fleshy
mass
grow
small
by
degrees
and
beautifully
less
before
the
trenchant
blades
of
the
hungry
mountaineers
appetising
yards
of
boudin
slipped
glibly
down
their
throats
rib
after
rib
of
tender
hump
was
picked
and
flung
to
the
wolves
and
when
human
nature
with
helpless
gratitude
and
confident
that
nothing
of
superexcellent
comestibility
remained
was
lazily
wiping
the
greasy
knife
that
had
done
such
good
service
skilful
hunter
was
seen
to
chuckle
to
himself
as
he
raked
the
deep
ashes
of
the
fire
and
drew
therefrom
a
pair
of
tongues
so
admirably
baked
so
soft
so
sweet
and
of
such
exquisite
flavour
that
a
veil
is
considerately
drawn
over
the
effects
their
discussion
produced
in
the
mind
of
our
greenhorn
la
bonté
and
the
raptures
they
excited
in
the
bosom
of
that
as
yet
most
ignorant
mountaineer
still
as
he
ate
he
wondered
and
wondering
admired
that
nature
in
giving
him
such
profound
gastronomic
powers
and
such
transcendant
capabilities
of
digestion
had
yet
bountifully
provided
an
edible
so
peculiarly
adapted
to
his
appetite
that
after
consuming
nearly
his
own
weight
in
rich
and
fat
buffalo
meat
he
felt
as
easy
and
as
little
incommoded
as
if
he
had
lightly
supped
on
strawberries
and
cream
sweet
was
the
digestive
pipe
after
such
a
feast
soft
was
the
sleep
and
deep
which
sealed
the
eyes
of
the
contented
trappers
that
night
it
felt
like
the
old
thing
they
said
to
be
once
more
amongst
the
meat
and
as
they
were
drawing
near
the
dangerous
portion
of
the
trail
they
felt
at
home
although
they
now
could
never
be
confident
when
they
lay
down
at
night
upon
their
buffalo
robes
of
awaking
again
in
this
life
knowing
as
they
did
full
well
that
savage
men
lurked
near
thirsting
for
their
blood
however
no
enemies
showed
themselves
as
yet
and
they
proceeded
quietly
up
the
river
vast
herds
of
buffaloes
darkening
the
plains
around
them
affording
them
more
than
abundance
of
the
choicest
meat
but
to
their
credit
be
it
spoken
no
more
was
killed
than
was
absolutely
required
the
cruel
slaughter
made
by
most
of
the
white
travellers
across
the
plains
who
wantonly
destroy
these
noble
animals
not
even
for
the
excitement
of
sport
but
in
and
insane
butchery
la
bonté
had
practice
enough
to
perfect
him
in
the
art
and
before
the
buffalo
range
was
passed
he
was
ranked
as
a
hunter
one
evening
he
had
left
the
camp
for
meat
and
was
approaching
a
band
of
cows
for
that
purpose
crawling
towards
them
along
the
bed
of
a
dry
hollow
in
the
prairie
when
he
observed
them
suddenly
jump
towards
him
and
immediately
afterwards
a
score
of
mounted
indians
appeared
whom
by
their
dress
he
at
once
knew
to
be
pawnees
and
enemies
thinking
they
might
not
discover
him
he
crouched
down
in
the
ravine
but
a
noise
behind
caused
him
to
turn
his
head
and
he
saw
some
five
or
six
advancing
up
the
bed
of
the
dry
creek
whilst
several
more
were
riding
on
the
bluffs
the
cunning
savages
had
cut
off
his
retreat
to
his
mule
which
he
saw
in
the
possession
of
one
of
them
his
presence
of
mind
however
did
not
desert
him
and
seeing
at
once
that
to
remain
where
he
was
would
be
like
being
caught
in
a
trap
as
the
indians
could
advance
to
the
edge
of
the
bluff
and
shoot
him
from
above
he
made
for
the
open
prairie
determined
at
least
to
sell
his
scalp
dearly
and
make
a
good
with
a
yell
the
indians
charged
but
halted
when
they
saw
the
sturdy
trapper
deliberately
kneel
and
resting
his
rifle
on
the
take
a
steady
aim
as
they
advanced
full
well
the
pawnees
know
to
their
cost
that
a
mountaineer
seldom
pulls
his
trigger
without
sending
a
bullet
to
the
mark
and
certain
that
one
at
least
must
fall
they
hesitated
to
make
the
onslaught
steadily
the
white
retreated
with
his
face
to
the
foe
bringing
the
rifle
to
his
shoulder
the
instant
that
one
advanced
within
shot
the
indians
galloping
round
firing
the
few
guns
they
had
amongst
them
at
long
distances
but
without
effect
one
young
brave
more
daring
than
the
rest
rode
out
of
the
crowd
and
dashed
at
the
hunter
throwing
himself
as
he
passed
within
a
few
yards
from
the
saddle
and
hanging
over
the
opposite
side
of
his
horse
thus
presenting
no
other
mark
than
his
left
foot
as
he
crossed
la
bonté
he
discharged
his
bow
from
under
his
horse
neck
and
with
such
good
aim
that
the
arrow
whizzing
through
the
air
struck
the
stock
of
the
hunter
rifle
which
was
at
his
shoulder
and
glancing
off
pierced
his
arm
inflicting
luckily
but
a
slight
wound
again
the
indian
turned
in
his
course
the
others
encouraging
him
with
loud
and
once
more
passing
at
still
less
distance
he
drew
his
arrow
to
the
head
this
time
however
the
eagle
eye
of
the
white
detected
the
action
and
suddenly
rising
from
his
knee
as
the
indian
approached
hanging
by
his
foot
alone
over
the
opposite
side
of
the
horse
he
jumped
towards
the
animal
with
outstretched
arms
and
a
loud
yell
causing
it
to
start
suddenly
and
swerve
from
its
course
the
indian
lost
his
and
after
a
fruitless
struggle
to
regain
his
position
fell
to
the
ground
but
instantly
rose
upon
his
feet
and
gallantly
confronted
the
mountaineer
striking
his
hand
upon
his
brawny
chest
and
shouting
a
loud
whoop
of
defiance
in
another
instant
the
rifle
of
la
bonté
had
poured
forth
its
contents
and
the
brave
savage
springing
into
the
air
fell
dead
to
the
ground
just
as
the
other
trappers
who
had
heard
the
firing
galloped
up
to
the
spot
at
sight
of
them
the
pawnees
with
yells
of
disappointed
vengeance
hastily
retreated
that
night
la
bonté
first
lifted
hair
a
few
days
later
the
mountaineers
reached
the
point
where
the
platte
divides
into
two
great
forks
the
northern
one
stretching
to
the
skirts
the
eastern
base
of
the
black
hills
and
sweeping
round
to
the
south
rises
in
the
vicinity
of
the
mountain
valley
called
the
new
park
receiving
the
laramie
medicine
bow
and
creeks
the
other
or
south
fork
strikes
towards
the
mountains
in
a
direction
hugging
the
base
of
the
main
chain
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
fed
by
several
small
creeks
rises
in
the
uplands
of
the
bayou
salade
near
which
is
also
the
source
of
the
arkansa
to
the
forks
of
the
platte
the
valley
of
that
river
extends
from
three
to
five
miles
on
each
side
enclosed
by
steep
sandy
bluffs
from
the
summits
of
which
the
prairies
stretch
away
in
broad
undulating
expanse
to
the
north
and
south
the
bottom
as
it
is
termed
is
but
thinly
covered
with
timber
the
being
scattered
only
here
and
there
but
some
of
the
islands
in
the
broad
bed
of
the
stream
are
well
wooded
leading
to
the
inference
that
the
trees
on
the
banks
have
been
felled
by
indians
who
formerly
frequented
the
neighbourhood
of
this
river
as
a
chosen
as
during
the
long
winters
the
pasture
in
the
vicinity
is
scarce
and
withered
the
indians
feed
their
horses
on
the
bark
of
the
sweet
upon
which
they
subsist
and
even
fatten
thus
wherever
a
village
has
encamped
the
trunks
of
these
trees
strew
the
ground
their
upper
limbs
and
smaller
branches
peeled
of
their
bark
and
looking
as
white
and
smooth
as
if
scraped
with
a
knife
on
the
forks
however
the
timber
is
heavier
and
of
greater
variety
some
of
the
creeks
being
well
wooded
with
ash
and
cherry
which
break
the
monotony
of
the
everlasting
dense
masses
of
buffalo
still
continued
to
darken
the
plains
and
numerous
bands
of
wolves
hovered
round
the
outskirts
of
the
vast
herds
singling
out
the
sick
and
wounded
animals
and
preying
upon
such
calves
as
the
rifles
and
arrows
of
the
hunters
had
bereaved
of
their
mothers
the
white
wolf
is
the
invariable
attendant
upon
the
buffalo
and
when
one
of
these
persevering
animals
is
seen
it
is
certain
sign
that
buffalo
are
not
far
distant
besides
the
buffalo
wolf
there
are
four
distinct
varieties
common
to
the
plains
and
all
more
or
less
attendant
upon
the
buffalo
these
are
the
black
the
gray
the
brown
and
last
and
least
the
or
of
the
mountaineers
the
or
medicine
wolf
of
the
indians
who
hold
the
latter
animal
in
reverential
awe
this
little
wolf
whose
fur
is
of
great
thickness
and
beauty
is
of
diminutive
size
but
wonderfully
sagacious
making
up
by
cunning
what
it
wants
in
physical
strength
in
bands
of
from
three
to
thirty
they
not
unfrequently
station
themselves
along
the
runs
of
the
deer
and
the
antelope
extending
their
line
for
many
the
quarry
being
started
each
wolf
follows
in
pursuit
until
tired
when
it
relinquishes
the
chase
to
another
relay
following
slowly
after
until
the
animal
is
fairly
run
down
when
all
hurry
to
the
spot
and
speedily
consume
the
carcass
the
cayeute
however
is
often
made
a
tool
of
by
his
larger
brethren
unless
indeed
he
acts
from
motives
of
spontaneous
charity
when
a
hunter
has
slaughtered
game
and
is
in
the
act
of
butchering
it
these
little
wolves
sit
patiently
at
a
short
distance
from
the
scene
of
operations
while
at
a
more
respectful
one
the
larger
wolves
the
white
or
gray
lope
hungrily
around
licking
their
chops
in
hungry
expectation
not
unfrequently
the
hunter
throws
a
piece
of
meat
towards
the
smaller
one
who
seizes
it
immediately
and
runs
off
with
the
morsel
in
his
mouth
before
he
gets
many
yards
with
his
prize
the
large
wolf
pounces
with
a
growl
upon
him
and
the
cayeute
dropping
the
meat
returns
to
his
former
position
and
will
continue
his
charitable
act
as
long
as
the
hunter
pleases
to
supply
him
wolves
are
so
common
on
the
plains
and
in
the
mountains
that
the
hunter
never
cares
to
throw
away
a
charge
of
ammunition
upon
them
although
the
ravenous
animals
are
a
constant
source
of
annoyance
to
him
creeping
to
the
at
night
and
gnawing
his
saddles
and
eating
the
skin
ropes
which
secure
the
horses
and
mules
to
their
pickets
and
even
their
very
hobbles
and
not
unfrequently
killing
or
entirely
disabling
the
animals
themselves
round
the
camp
during
the
night
the
cayeute
keeps
unremitting
watch
and
the
traveller
not
unfrequently
starts
from
his
bed
with
affright
as
the
mournful
and
unearthly
chiding
of
the
wolf
breaks
suddenly
upon
his
ear
the
howl
being
taken
up
by
others
of
the
band
until
it
dies
away
in
the
distance
or
some
straggler
passing
within
hearing
answers
to
the
note
and
howls
as
he
lopes
away
our
party
crossed
the
south
fork
about
ten
miles
from
its
juncture
with
the
main
stream
and
then
passing
the
prairie
struck
the
north
fork
a
day
travel
from

at
the
mouth
of
an
creek
they
came
upon

were
in

they
moved
along

two
experienced
mountaineers
always
heading
the
advance
about
noon
they
had
crossed
over
to
the
left
bank
of
the
fork
intending
to
camp
on
a
large
creek
where
some
fresh
beaver
sign
had
attracted
the
attention
of
some
of
the
trappers
and
as
on
further
examination
it
appeared
that
two
or
three
lodges
of
that
animal
were
not
far
distant
it
was
determined
to
remain
here
a
day
or
two
and
set
their
traps

started
up

carefully
examining
the
banks
for

the

was
in

suddenly
paused
and
looking
intently
up

up
his

to
his

approaching

on

down

on
being
apprised
of
it
instantly
drove
in
their
animals

picketed
them
and
hardly
had
they
done
so
when
a
band
of
indians
made
their
appearance
on
the
banks
of

creek
from
whence
they
galloped
to
the
bluff
which
overlooked
the
camp
at
the
distance
of
about
six
hundred
yards
and
crowning
this
in
number
some
forty
or
more
commenced
brandishing
their
spears
and
guns
and
whooping
loud
yells
of
defiance
the
trappers
had
formed
a
little
of
their
packs
forming
a
semicircle
the
chord
of
which
was
made
by
the
animals
standing
in
a
line
side
by
side
closely
picketed
and
hobbled
behind
this
defence
stood
the
mountaineers
rifle
in
hand
and
silent
and
determined
the
indians
presently
descended
the
bluff
on
foot
leaving
their
animals
in
charge
of
a
few
of
the
party
and
scattering
advanced
under
cover
of
the
sage
bushes
which
dotted
the
bottom
to
about
two
hundred
yards
of
the
whites
then
a
chief
advanced
before
the
rest
and
made
the
sign
for
a
talk
with
the
which
led
to
a
consultation
amongst
the
latter
as
to
the
policy
of
acceding
to
it
they
were
in
doubts
as
to
the
nation
these
indians
belonged
to
some
bands
of
the
sioux
being
friendly
and
others
bitterly
hostile
to
the
whites
gonneville
who
spoke
the
sioux
language
and
was
well
acquainted
with
the
nation
affirmed
they
belonged
to
a
band
called
the
well
known
to
be
the
most
of
that
treacherous
nation
another
of
the
party
maintained
they
were
brulés
and
that
the
chief
advancing
towards
them
was
the
or
bull
tail
a
most
friendly
chief
of
that
tribe
the
majority
however
trusted
to
gonneville
and
he
volunteered
to
go
out
to
meet
the
indian
and
hear
what
he
had
to
say
divesting
himself
of
all
arms
save
his
he
advanced
towards
the
savage
who
awaited
his
approach
enveloped
in
the
folds
of
his
blanket
at
a
glance
he
knew
him
to
be
a
from
the
peculiar
make
of
his
moccasins
and
the
way
in
which
his
face
was
daubed
with
paint
howgh
exclaimed
both
as
they
met
and
after
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
the
indian
spoke
why
the
hid
behind
their
packs
when
his
band
approached
were
they
afraid
or
were
they
preparing
a
to
entertain
their
friends
the
whites
were
passing
through
his
country
burning
his
wood
drinking
his
water
and
killing
his
game
but
he
knew
they
had
now
come
to
pay
for
the
mischief
they
had
done
and
that
the
mules
and
horses
they
had
brought
with
them
were
intended
as
a
present
to
their
red
friends
he
was
he
said
the
brave
bear
his
tongue
was
short
but
his
arm
long
and
he
loved
rather
to
speak
with
his
bow
and
his
lance
than
with
the
weapon
of
a
squaw
he
had
said
it
the
had
horses
with
them
and
mules
and
these
were
for
him
he
knew
and
for
his
let
the
go
back
to
his
people
and
return
with
the
animals
or
he
the
bear
would
have
to
come
and
take
them
and
his
young
men
would
get
mad
and
would
feel
blood
in
their
eyes
and
then
he
would
have
no
power
over
them
and
the
whites
would
have
to
under
the
trapper
answered
the
he
said
had
brought
the
horses
for
hearts
were
big
but
not
towards
the
and
if
they
had
to
give
up
their
animals
it
would
be
to
and
not
they
were
not
french
engagés
but
and
however
short
were
the
tongues
of
the
theirs
were
still
shorter
and
their
rifles
longer
the
were
dogs
and
squaws
and
the
spat
upon
saying
this
the
trapper
turned
his
back
and
rejoined
his
companions
whilst
the
indian
slowly
proceeded
to
his
people
who
on
learning
the
contemptuous
way
in
which
their
threats
had
been
treated
testified
their
anger
with
loud
yells
and
seeking
whatever
cover
was
afforded
commenced
a
scattering
volley
upon
the
camp
of
the
mountaineers
the
latter
reserved
their
fire
treating
with
cool
indifference
the
balls
which
began
to
rattle
about
them
but
as
the
indians
emboldened
by
this
apparent
inaction
rushed
for
a
closer
position
and
exposed
their
bodies
within
a
long
range
rifles
rang
from
the
assailed
and
two
indians
fell
dead
one
or
two
more
being
wounded
as
yet
not
one
of
the
whites
had
been
touched
but
several
of
the
animals
had
received
wounds
from
the
enemy
fire
of
balls
and
arrows
indeed
the
indians
remained
at
too
great
a
distance
to
render
the
volleys
from
their
crazy
fusees
any
thing
like
effectual
and
had
to
raise
their
pieces
considerably
to
make
their
bullets
reach
as
far
as
the
camp
after
three
of
their
band
had
been
killed
outright
and
many
more
wounded
their
fire
began
to
slacken
and
they
drew
off
to
a
greater
distance
evidently
resolved
to
beat
a
retreat
retiring
to
the
bluff
they
discharged
their
pieces
in
a
last
volley
mounted
their
horses
and
galloped
off
carrying
their
wounded
with
them
this
last
volley
however
although
intended
as
a
mere
bravado
unfortunately
proved
fatal
to
one
of
the
whites
gonneville
at
the
moment
was
standing
on
a
pack
to
get
an
uninterrupted
sight
for
a
last
shot
when
one
of
the
random
bullets
struck
him
in
the
breast
la
bonté
caught
him
in
his
arms
as
he
was
about
to
fall
and
laying
the
wounded
trapper
gently
on
the
ground
stripped
him
of
his
buckskin
to
examine
the
wound
a
glance
was
sufficient
to
convince
his
companions
that
the
blow
was
mortal
the
ball
had
passed
through
the
lungs
and
in
a
few
moments
the
throat
of
the
wounded
man
swelled
and
turned
to
a
livid
blue
colour
as
the
choking
blood
ascended
only
a
few
drops
of
purple
blood
trickled
from
the
wound
fatal
sign
the
eyes
of
the
mountaineer
were
already
glazing
with
death
icy
touch
his
hand
still
grasped
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
which
had
done
good
service
in
the
fray
anon
he
essayed
to
speak
but
choked
with
blood
only
a
few
inarticulate
words
reached
the
ears
of
his
companions
as
they
bent
over
him
they
heard
him
say
the
words
gurgling
in
his
throat
and
opening
his
eyes
once
more
and
turning
them
upwards
for
a
last
look
at
the
bright
sun
the
trapper
turned
gently
on
his
side
and
breathed
his
last
sigh
with
no
other
tools
than
their
the
hunters
dug
a
grave
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
and
whilst
some
were
engaged
in
this
work
others
sought
the
bodies
of
the
indians
they
had
slain
in
the
attack
and
presently
returned
with
three
reeking
scalps
the
trophies
of
the
fight
the
body
of
the
mountaineer
was
wrapped
in
a
buffalo
robe
the
scalps
being
placed
on
his
breast
and
the
dead
man
was
then
laid
in
the
shallow
grave
and
quickly
a
word
of
prayer
or
sigh
of
grief
for
however
much
his
companions
may
have
felt
not
a
word
escaped
them
the
bitten
lip
and
frowning
brow
told
of
anger
rather
than
of
sorrow
as
they
they
thought
would
better
please
the
spirit
of
the
dead
man
than
vain
and
lasting
revenge
trampling
down
the
earth
which
filled
the
grave
they
raised
upon
it
a
pile
of
heavy
stones
and
packing
their
mules
once
more
and
taking
a
last
look
at
their
comrade
lonely
they
turned
their
backs
upon
the
stream
which
has
ever
since
been
known
as
gonneville
if
the
reader
casts
his
eye
over
any
of
the

of

a
sudden
death
from

a
more
lingering
fate

in
some
lonely
gorge
of
the
mountains
where
no
footfall
save
their
own
or
the
heavy
tread
of

the
unbroken
silence
of
the
awful
solitude

as
many
winters
pass
without
some
old
familiar
faces

their
appearance
at
the

their
long
protracted
absence
may
perhaps
elicit
a
remark
as
to
where
such
and
such
a
mountain

can
have
betaken
himself
to
which
the
casual
rejoinder
of
gone

too
often
gives
a
short
but
certain
answer
in
all

philosophy
of

with

to

the

soon
the

lost
all
traces
of
civilised
humanity
and
might
justly
claim
to
be
considered
as
hard
a
case
as
any
of
the
mountaineers
then
present
long
before
the
spring
opened
he
had
lost
all
the
produce
of
his
hunt
and
both
his
animals
which
however
by
a
stroke
of
luck
he
recovered
and
wisely
held
on
to
for
the
future
right
glad
when
spring
appeared
he
started
from
brown
hole
with
four
companions
to
hunt
the
uintah
or
snake
country
and
the
affluents
of
the
larger
streams
which
rise
in
that
region
and
fall
into
the
gulf
of
california
in
the
valley
of
the
bear
river
they
found
beaver
abundant
and
trapped
their
way
westward
until
they
came
upon
the
famed
locality
of
the
beer
and
soda
fountains
of
mineral
water
renowned
amongst
the
trappers
as
being
medicine
of
the
first
order
arriving
one
evening
about
sundown
at
the
bear
spring
they
found
a
solitary
trapper
sitting
over
the
rocky
basin
intently
regarding
with
no
little
awe
the
curious
phenomenon
of
the
bubbling
gas
behind
him
were
piled
his
saddles
and
a
pack
of
skins
and
at
a
little
distance
a
hobbled
indian
pony
fed
amongst
the
cedars
which
formed
a
grove
round
the
spring
as
the
three
hunters
dismounted
from
their
animals
the
lone
trapper
scarcely
noticed
their
arrival
his
eyes
being
still
intently
fixed
upon
the
water
looking
round
at
last
he
was
instantly
recognised
by
one
of
la
bonté
companions
and
saluted
as
old
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
buckskin
his
face
neck
and
hands
appeared
to
be
of
the
same
leathery
texture
so
nearly
did
they
assimilate
in
colour
to
the
materials
of
his
dress
he
was
at
least
six
feet
two
or
three
in
his
moccasins
and
wiry
with
long
arms
ending
in
hands
of
tremendous
grasp
and
a
quantity
of
straight
black
hair
hanging
on
his
shoulders
his
features
which
were
undeniably
good
wore
an
expression
of
comical
gravity
never
relaxing
into
a
smile
which
a
broad
mouth
could
have
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
what
boys
he
said
will
you
be
simple
enough
to
camp
here
alongside
these
springs
nothing
good
ever
came
of
sleeping
here
i
tell
you
and
the
worst
kind
of
devils
are
in
those
dancing
why
old

what

then
and
camp
at
that
this
niggur
answered
rube
solemnly
has
been
down
upon
a
sight
too
often
to
be
skeared
by
what
can
come
out
from
them
waters
and
thar
ar
a

as
hisses

again
on
such
varmint
i
raise
his
hair
as
sure
as
spite
of
the
reputed
dangers
of
the
locality
the
trappers
camped
on
the
spot
and
many
a
draught
of
the
delicious
sparkling
water
they
quaffed
in
honour
of
the
medicine
of
the
fount
rube
however
sat
sulky
and
silent
his
huge
form
bending
over
his
legs
which
were
crossed
indian
fashion
under
him
and
his
long
bony
fingers
spread
over
the
fire
which
had
been
made
handy
to
the
spring
at
last
they
elicited
from
him
that
he
had
sought
this
spot
for
the
purpose
of
having
been
persecuted
by
extraordinary
ill
luck
even
at
this
early
period
of
his
indians
having
stolen
two
out
of
his
three
animals
and
three
of
his
traps
he
had
therefore
sought
the
springs
for
the
purpose
of
invoking
the
fountain
spirits
which
a
perfect
indian
in
his
simple
heart
he
implicitly
believed
to
inhabit
their
mysterious
waters
when
the
others
had
as
he
thought
fallen
asleep
la
bonté
observed
the
trapper
take
from
his
pouch
a
curiously
carved
red
stone
pipe
which
he
carefully
charged
with
tobacco
and
then
approaching
the
spring
he
walked
three
times
round
it
and
gravely
sat
himself
down
striking
fire
with
his
flint
and
steel
he
lit
his
pipe
and
bending
the
stem
three
several
times
towards
the
water
he
inhaled
a
vast
quantity
of
smoke
and
bending
back
his
neck
and
looking
upwards
puffed
it
into
the
air
he
then
blew
another
puff
towards
the
four
points
of
the
compass
and
emptying
the
pipe
into
his
hand
cast
the
consecrated
contents
into
the
spring
saying
a
few
indian
medicine
words
of
cabalistic
import
having
performed
the
ceremony
to
his
satisfaction
he
returned
to
the
fire
smoked
a
pipe
on
his
own
hook
and
turned
into
his
buffalo
robe
conscious
of
having
done
a
most
important
duty
in
the
course
of
their
trapping
expedition
and
accompanied
by
rube
who
knew
the
country
well
they
passed
near
the
great
salt
lake
a
vast
inland
sea
whose
salitrose
waters
cover
an
extent
of
upwards
of
one
hundred
and
forty
miles
in
length
by
eighty
in
breadth
fed
by
several
streams
of
which
the
big
bear
river
is
the
most
considerable
this
lake
presents
the
curious
phenomenon
of
a
vast
body
of
water
without
any
known
outlet
according
to
the
trappers
an
island
from
which
rises
a
chain
of
lofty
mountains
nearly
divides
the
portion
of
the
lake
whilst
a
smaller
one
within
twelve
miles
of
the
northern
shore
rises
six
hundred
feet
from
the
level
of
the
water
rube
declared
to
his
companions
that
the
larger
island
was
known
by
the
indians
to
be
inhabited
by
a
race
of
giants
with
whom
no
communication
had
ever
been
held
by
mortal
man
and
but
for
the
casual
wafting
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
of
logs
of
gigantic
trees
cut
by
axes
of
extraordinary
size
the
world
would
never
have
known
that
such
a
people
existed
they
were
moreover
white
as
themselves
and
lived
upon
corn
and
fruits
and
rode
on
elephants
whilst
following
a
small
creek
at
the
extremity
of
the
lake
they
came
upon
a
band
of
miserable
indians
who
from
the
fact
of
their
subsisting
chiefly
on
roots
are
called
the
diggers
at
first
sight
of
the
whites
they
immediately
fled
from
their
wretched
huts
and
made
towards
the
mountain
but
one
of
the
trappers
galloping
up
on
his
horse
cut
off
their
retreat
and
drove
them
like
sheep
before
him
back
to
their
village
a
few
of
these
wretched
creatures
came
into
camp
at
sundown
and
were
regaled
with
such
meat
as
the
larder
afforded
they
appeared
to
have
no
other
food
in
their
village
but
bags
of
dried
ants
and
their
larvæ
and
a
few
roots
of
the
yampah
their
huts
were
constructed
of
a
few
bushes
of
piled
up
as
a
sort
of
breakwind
in
which
they
huddled
in
their
filthy
skins
during
the
night
they
crawled
up
to
the
camp
and
stole
two
of
the
horses
and
the
next
morning
not
a
sign
of
them
was
visible
now
la
bonté
witnessed
a
case
of
mountain
law
and
the
practical
effects
of
the
lex
talionis
of
the
far
west
the
trail
of
the
runaway
diggers
bore
to
the
or
along
the
skirt
of
a
barren
waterless
desert
which
stretches
far
away
from
the
southern
shores
of
the
salt
lake
to
the
borders
of
upper
california
la
bonté
with
three
others
determined
to
follow
the
thieves
recover
their
animals
and
then
rejoin
the
other
two
luke
and
rube
on
a
creek
two
days
journey
from
their
present
camp
starting
at
sunrise
they
rode
on
at
a
rapid
pace
all
day
closely
following
the
trail
which
led
directly
to
the
through
a
wretched
sandy
country
without
game
or
water
from
the
appearance
of
the
track
the
indians
must
still
have
been
several
hours
ahead
of
them
when
the
fatigue
of
their
horses
suffering
from
want
of
grass
and
water
compelled
them
to
camp
near
the
head
of
a
small
where
they
luckily
found
a
hole
containing
a
little
water
and
whence
a
broad
indian
trail
passed
apparently
frequently
used
long
before
daylight
they
were
again
in
the
saddle
and
after
proceeding
a
few
miles
saw
the
lights
of
several
fires
a
short
distance
ahead
of
them
halting
here
one
of
the
party
advanced
on
foot
to
reconnoitre
and
presently
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
the
party
they
were
in
pursuit
of
had
joined
a
village
numbering
thirty
or
forty
huts
loosening
their
girths
they
permitted
their
tired
animals
to
feed
on
the
scanty
herbage
which
presented
itself
whilst
they
refreshed
themselves
with
a
pipe
of
they
had
no
meat
of
any
description
with
them
and
the
country
afforded
no
game
as
the
first
streak
of
dawn
appeared
in
the
east
they
mounted
their
horses
after
first
examining
their
rifles
and
moved
cautiously
towards
the
indian
village
as
it
was
scarcely
light
enough
for
their
operations
they
waited
behind
a
sandhill
in
the
vicinity
until
objects
became
more
distinct
and
then
emerging
from
their
cover
with
loud
they
charged
abreast
into
the
midst
of
the
village
as
the
frightened
indians
were
scarcely
risen
from
their
beds
no
opposition
was
given
to
the
daring
mountaineers
who
rushing
upon
the
flying
crowd
discharged
their
rifles
at
close
quarters
and
then
springing
from
their
horses
attacked
them
knife
in
hand
and
only
ceased
the
work
of
butchery
when
nine
indians
lay
dead
upon
the
ground
all
this
time
the
women
half
dead
with
fright
were
huddled
together
on
the
ground
howling
piteously
and
the
mountaineers
advancing
to
them
whirled
their
lassos
round
their
heads
and
throwing
the
open
nooses
into
the
midst
hauled
out
three
of
them
and
securing
their
arms
in
the
rope
bound
them
to
a
tree
and
then
proceeded
to
scalp
the
dead
bodies
whilst
they
were
engaged
in
this
work
an
old
indian
withered
and
grisly
and
hardly
bigger
than
an
ape
suddenly
emerged
from
a
rock
holding
in
his
left
hand
a
bow
and
a
handful
of
arrows
whilst
one
was
already
drawn
to
the
head
running
towards
them
and
almost
before
the
hunters
were
aware
of
his
presence
he
discharged
an
arrow
at
a
few
yards
distance
which
buried
itself
in
the
ground
not
a
foot
from
la
bonté
head
as
he
bent
over
the
body
of
the
indian
he
was
scalping
and
hardly
had
the
whiz
ceased
when
whirr
flew
another
striking
him
in
his
right
shoulder
before
the
indian
could
fit
a
third
arrow
to
his
bow
la
bonté
sprang
upon
him
seized
him
by
the
middle
and
spinning
his
pigmy
form
round
his
head
as
easily
as
he
would
have
twirled
a
tomahawk
he
threw
him
with
tremendous
force
on
the
ground
at
the
feet
of
one
of
his
companions
who
stooping
down
coolly
thrust
his
knife
into
the
indian
breast
and
quickly
tore
off
his
scalp
the
slaughter
over
without
casting
an
eye
to
the
captive
squaws
the
trappers
proceeded
to
search
the
village
for
food
of
which
they
stood
much
in
need
nothing
however
was
found
but
a
few
bags
of
dried
ants
which
after
eating
voraciously
of
but
with
wry
mouths
they
threw
aside
saying
the
food
was
worse
than
poor
they
found
however
the
animals
they
had
been
robbed
of
and
two
more
besides
creatures
and
on
these
mounting
their
captives
they
hurried
away
on
their
journey
back
to
their
companions
the
distance
being
computed
at
three
days
travel
from
their
present
position
however
they
thought
by
taking
a
more
direct
course
they
might
find
better
pasture
for
their
animals
and
water
besides
saving
at
least
half
a
day
by
the
short
cut
to
their
cost
they
proved
the
old
saying
that
a
short
cut
is
always
a
long
road
as
will
be
presently
shown
it
has
been
said
that
from
the
extremity
of
the
great
salt
lake
a
vast
desert
extends
for
hundreds
of
miles
unbroken
by
the
slightest
vegetation
destitute
of
game
and
water
and
presenting
a
cheerless
expanse
of
sandy
plain
or
rugged
mountain
thinly
covered
with
dwarf
pine
or
cedar
the
only
evidence
of
vegetable
life
into
this
desert
ignorant
of
the
country
the
trappers
struck
intending
to
make
their
short
cut
and
travelling
on
all
day
were
compelled
to
camp
at
night
without
water
or
pasture
for
their
exhausted
animals
and
themselves
ravenous
with
hunger
and
parched
with
thirst
the
next
day
three
of
their
animals
gave
out
and
they
were
fain
to
leave
them
behind
but
imagining
that
they
must
soon
strike
a
creek
they
pushed
on
until
noon
but
still
no
water
presented
itself
nor
a
sign
of
game
of
any
description
the
animals
were
nearly
exhausted
and
a
horse
which
could
scarcely
keep
up
with
the
slow
pace
of
the
others
was
killed
and
its
blood
greedily
drunk
a
portion
of
the
flesh
being
eaten
raw
and
a
supply
carried
with
them
for
future
emergencies
the
next
morning
two
of
the
horses
lay
dead
at
their
pickets
and
one
only
remained
and
this
in
such
a
miserable
state
that
it
could
not
possibly
have
travelled
six
miles
further
it
was
therefore
killed
and
its
blood
drunk
of
which
however
the
captive
squaws
refused
to
partake
the
men
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
their
consuming
thirst
which
the
hot
horse
blood
only
served
to
increase
their
lips
became
parched
and
swollen
their
eyes
and
a
giddy
sickness
seized
them
at
intervals
about
they
came
in
sight
of
a
mountain
on
their
right
hand
which
appeared
to
be
more
thickly
clothed
with
vegetation
and
arguing
from
this
that
water
would
be
found
there
they
left
their
course
and
made
towards
it
although
some
eight
or
ten
miles
distant
on
arriving
at
the
base
the
most
minute
search
failed
to
discover
the
slightest
traces
of
water
and
the
vegetation
merely
consisted
of
dwarf
piñon
and
cedar
with
their
sufferings
increased
by
the
exertions
they
had
used
in
reaching
the
mountain
they
once
more
sought
the
trail
but
every
step
told
on
their
exhausted
frames
the
sun
was
very
powerful
the
sand
over
which
they
floundered
was
deep
and
heavy
and
to
complete
their
sufferings
a
high
wind
blew
it
in
their
faces
filling
their
mouths
and
noses
with
its
searching
particles
still
they
struggled
onwards
manfully
and
not
a
murmur
was
heard
until
their
hunger
had
entered
the
upon
the
road
to
starvation
they
had
now
been
three
days
without
food
or
water
under
which
privation
nature
can
hardly
sustain
herself
for
a
much
longer
period
on
the
fourth
morning
the
men
looked
wolfish
their
captives
following
behind
in
sullen
and
perfect
indifference
occasionally
stooping
down
to
catch
a
beetle
if
one
presented
itself
and
greedily
devouring
it
a
man
named
forey
a
canadian
was
the
first
to
complain
if
this
lasted
another
sundown
he
said
some
of
them
would
rubbed
out
that
meat
had
to
be
anyhow
and
for
his
part
he
knew
where
to
look
for
a
feed
if
no
game
was
seen
before
they
put
out
of
camp
on
the
morrow
and
meat
was
meat
anyhow
they
fixed
no
answer
was
made
to
this
though
his
companions
well
understood
him
their
natures
as
yet
revolted
against
the
last
expedient
as
for
the
three
squaws
all
of
them
young
girls
they
followed
behind
their
captors
without
a
word
of
complaint
and
with
the
stoical
indifference
to
pain
and
suffering
which
alike
characterises
the
haughty
delaware
of
the
north
and
the
miserable
stunted
digger
of
the
deserts
of
the
far
west
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
the
party
were
seated
round
a
small
fire
of
piñon
hardly
able
to
rise
and
commence
their
journey
the
squaws
squatting
over
another
at
a
little
distance
when
forey
commenced
again
to
suggest
that
if
nothing
offered
they
must
either
take
the
alternative
of
starving
to
death
for
they
could
not
hope
to
last
another
day
or
have
recourse
to
the
revolting
extremity
of
sacrificing
one
of
the
party
to
save
the
lives
of
all
to
this
however
there
was
a
murmur
of
dissent
and
it
was
finally
resolved
that
all
should
sally
out
and
hunt
for
a
had
been
discovered
near
the
camp
which
although
it
was
not
a
fresh
one
proved
that
there
must
be
game
in
the
vicinity
weak
and
exhausted
as
they
were
they
took
their
rifles
and
started
for
the
neighbouring
uplands
each
taking
a
different
direction
it
was
nearly
sunset
when
la
bonté
returned
to
the
camp
where
he
already
espied
one
of
his
companions
engaged
in
cooking
something
over
the
fire
hurrying
to
the
spot
overjoyed
with
the
anticipations
of
a
feast
he
observed
that
the
squaws
were
gone
but
at
the
same
time
thought
it
was
not
improbable
they
had
escaped
during
their
absence
approaching
the
fire
he
observed
forey
broiling
some
meat
on
the
embers
whilst
at
a
little
distance
lay
what
he
fancied
was
the
carcass
of
a
deer
hurrah
boy
he
exclaimed
as
he
drew
near
the
fire
you
a
i
i
have
rejoined
the
other
turning
his
meat
with
the
point
of
his
butcher
knife
there
the
meat
la
bonté
drew
the
knife
from
his
scabbard
and
approached
the
spot
his
companion
was
pointing
to
but
what
was
his
horror
to
see
the
yet
quivering
body
of
one
of
the
indian
squaws
with
a
large
portion
of
the
flesh
butchered
from
it
part
of
which
forey
was
already
greedily
devouring
the
knife
dropped
from
his
hand
and
his
heart
rose
to
his
throat
the
next
day
he
and
his
companion
struck
the
creek
where
rube
and
the
other
trapper
had
agreed
to
await
them
and
found
them
in
camp
with
plenty
of
meat
and
about
to
start
again
on
their
hunt
having
given
up
the
others
for
lost
from
the
day
they
parted
nothing
was
ever
heard
of
la
bonté
other
two
companions
who
doubtless
fell
a
prey
to
utter
exhaustion
and
were
unable
to
return
to
the
camp
and
thus
ended
the
digger
expedition
it
may
appear
almost
incredible
that
men
having
civilised
blood
in
their
veins
could
perpetrate
such
wanton
and
acts
of
aggression
on
the
wretched
indians
as
that
detailed
above
but
it
is
fact
that
the
mountaineers
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
slaughtering
these
miserable
diggers
and
attacking
their
villages
often
for
the
purpose
of
capturing
women
whom
they
carry
off
and
not
unfrequently
sell
to
other
tribes
or
to
each
other
in
these
attacks
neither
sex
nor
age
is
spared
and
your
mountaineer
has
as
little
compunction
in
taking
the
life
of
an
indian
woman
as
he
would
have
in
sending
his
through
the
brain
of
a
crow
or
blackfoot
warrior
la
bonté
now
found
himself
without
animals
and
fairly
afoot
consequently
nothing
remained
for
him
but
to
seek
some
of
the
trapping
bands
and
hire
himself
for
the
hunt
luckily
for
him
he
soon
fell
in
with
roubideau
on
his
way
to
uintah
and
was
supplied
by
him
with
a
couple
of
animals
and
thus
equipped
he
started
again
with
a
large
band
of
trappers
who
were
going
to
hunt
on
the
waters
of
grand
river
and
the
gila
here
they
fell
in
with
another
nation
of
indians
from
which
branch
out
the
innumerable
tribes
inhabiting
northern
mexico
and
part
of
california
they
were
in
general
friendly
but
lost
no
opportunity
of
stealing
horses
or
any
articles
left
lying
about
the
camp
on
one
occasion
the
trappers
being
camped
on
a
northern
affluent
of
the
gila
a
volley
of
arrows
was
discharged
amongst
them
severely
wounding
one
or
two
of
the
party
as
they
sat
round
the
camp
fires
the
attack
however
was
not
renewed
and
the
next
day
the
camp
was
moved
further
down
the
stream
where
beaver
was
tolerably
abundant
before
sundown
a
number
of
indians
made
their
appearance
and
making
signs
of
peace
were
admitted
into
the
camp
the
trappers
were
all
sitting
at
their
suppers
over
the
fires
the
indians
looking
gravely
on
when
it
was
remarked
that
now
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
retaliate
upon
them
for
the
trouble
their
incessant
attacks
had
entailed
upon
the
camp
the
suggestion
was
highly
approved
of
and
instantly
acted
upon
springing
to
their
feet
the
trappers
seized
their
rifles
and
commenced
the
slaughter
the
indians
fled
without
resistance
and
numbers
fell
before
the
rifles
of
the
mountaineers
a
chief
who
had
been
sitting
on
a
rock
near
the
fire
where
the
leader
of
the
trappers
sat
had
been
singled
out
by
the
latter
as
the
first
mark
for
his
rifle
placing
the
muzzle
to
his
heart
he
pulled
the
trigger
but
the
indian
with
extraordinary
tenacity
of
life
rose
and
grappled
with
his
assailant
the
white
was
a
tall
powerful
man
but
notwithstanding
the
deadly
wound
the
indian
had
received
he
had
his
equal
in
strength
to
contend
against
the
naked
form
of
the
indian
twisted
and
writhed
in
his
grasp
as
he
sought
to
avoid
the
trapper
uplifted
knife
many
of
the
latter
companions
advanced
to
administer
the
de
to
the
savage
but
the
trapper
cried
to
them
to
keep
off
if
he
could
whip
the
injun
he
said
he
go
at
length
he
succeeded
in
throwing
him
and
plunging
his
knife
no
less
than
seven
times
into
his
body
he
tore
off
his
scalp
and
went
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
savages
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
all
the
party
returned
and
sitting
by
the
fires
resumed
their
suppers
which
had
been
interrupted
in
the
manner
just
described
walker
the
captain
of
the
band
sat
down
by
the
fire
where
he
had
been
engaged
in
the
struggle
with
the
indian
chief
whose
body
was
lying
within
a
few
paces
of
it
he
was
in
the
act
of
fighting
the
battle
over
again
to
one
of
his
companions
and
was
saying
that
the
indian
had
as
much
life
in
him
as
a
buffalo
bull
when
to
the
horror
of
all
present
the
savage
who
had
received
wounds
sufficient
for
twenty
deaths
suddenly
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
the
fire
shedding
a
glowing
light
upon
the
horrid
spectacle
the
face
was
a
mass
of
clotted
blood
which
flowed
from
the
lacerated
scalp
whilst
gouts
of
blood
streamed
from
eight
gaping
wounds
in
the
naked
breast
slowly
this
frightful
figure
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
and
bending
slowly
forward
to
the
fire
the
mouth
was
seen
to
open
wide
and
a
hollow
from
it
exclaimed
the
jumping
up
he
placed
a
pistol
to
the
ghastly
head
the
eyes
of
which
sternly
fixed
themselves
on
his
and
pulling
the
trigger
blew
the
poor
wretch
skull
to
atoms
the
gila
passes
through
a
barren
sandy
country
with
but
little
game
and
sparsely
inhabited
by
several
different
tribes
of
the
great
nation
of
the
apache
unlike
the
rivers
of
this
western
region
this
stream
is
in
most
parts
of
its
course
particularly
towards
its
upper
waters
entirely
bare
of
timber
and
the
bottom
through
which
it
runs
affords
but
little
of
the
coarsest
grass
whilst
on
this
stream
the
trapping
party
lost
several
animals
for
want
of
pasture
and
many
more
from
the
predatory
attacks
of
the
cunning
indians
these
losses
however
they
invariably
made
good
whenever
they
encountered
a
native
care
moreover
to
repay
themselves
with
interest
whenever
occasion
offered
notwithstanding
the
sterile
nature
of
the
country
the
trappers
during
their
passage
up
the
gila
saw
with
astonishment
that
the
arid
and
barren
valley
had
once
been
peopled
by
a
race
of
men
far
superior
to
the
present
nomade
tribes
who
roam
over
it
with
no
little
awe
they
gazed
upon
the
ruined
walls
of
large
cities
and
the
remains
of
houses
with
their
ponderous
beams
and
joists
still
testifying
to
the
skill
and
industry
with
which
they
were
constructed
huge
ditches
and
irrigating
canals
now
filled
with
rank
vegetation
furrowed
the
plains
in
the
vicinity
marking
the
spot
where
once
green
waving
maize
and
smiling
gardens
covered
what
now
is
a
bare
and
sandy
desert
pieces
of
broken
pottery
of
domestic
utensils
stained
with
bright
colours
every
where
strewed
the
ground
and
spear
and
of
stone
and
quaintly
carved
idols
and
women
ornaments
of
agate
and
obsidian
were
picked
up
often
by
the
wondering
trappers
examined
with
curiosity
and
thrown
carelessly
aside
a
taos
indian
who
was
amongst
the
band
was
evidently
impressed
with
a
melancholy
awe
as
he
regarded
these
ancient
monuments
of
his
fallen
people
at
midnight
he
rose
from
his
blanket
and
left
the
camp
which
was
in
the
vicinity
of
the
ruined
city
stealthily
picking
his
way
through
the
line
of
slumbering
forms
which
lay
around
and
the
watchful
sentinel
observed
him
approach
the
ruins
with
a
slow
and
reverential
gait
entering
the
mouldering
walls
he
gazed
silently
around
where
in
ages
past
his
ancestors
trod
proudly
a
civilised
race
the
tradition
of
which
well
known
to
his
people
served
but
to
make
their
present
degraded
position
more
galling
and
apparent
cowering
under
the
shadow
of
a
crumbling
wall
the
indian
drew
his
blanket
over
his
head
and
conjured
to
his
mind
eye
the
former
power
and
grandeur
of
his
warlike
people
who
forsaking
their
own
country
for
causes
of
which
no
tradition
however
dim
now
exists
sought
in
the
fruitful
and
teeming
valleys
of
the
south
a
soil
and
climate
which
their
own
lands
did
not
afford
and
displacing
the
wild
and
barbarous
hordes
inhabiting
the
land
raised
there
a
mighty
empire
great
in
riches
and
civilisation
the
indian
bowed
his
head
and
mourned
the
fallen
greatness
of
his
tribe
rising
he
slowly
drew
his
tattered
blanket
round
his
body
and
prepared
to
leave
the
spot
when
the
shadow
of
a
moving
figure
creeping
past
a
gap
in
the
ruined
wall
through
which
the
moonbeams
played
suddenly
arrested
his
attention
rigid
as
a
statue
he
stood
transfixed
to
the
spot
thinking
a
former
inhabitant
of
the
city
was
visiting
in
a
ghostly
form
the
scenes
his
body
once
knew
so
well
the
bow
in
his
right
hand
shook
with
fear
as
he
saw
the
shadow
approach
but
was
as
tightly
and
steadily
grasped
when
on
the
figure
emerging
from
the
shade
of
the
wall
he
distinguished
the
form
of
a
naked
apache
armed
with
bow
and
arrow
crawling
stealthily
through
the
gloomy
ruins
standing
undiscovered
within
the
shadow
of
the
wall
the
taos
raised
his
bow
and
drew
an
arrow
to
the
head
until
the
other
who
was
bending
low
to
keep
under
cover
of
the
wall
and
thus
approach
the
sentinel
standing
at
a
short
distance
seeing
suddenly
the
shadow
on
the
ground
rose
upright
on
his
legs
and
knowing
escape
was
impossible
threw
his
arms
down
his
sides
and
drawing
himself
erect
exclaimed
in
a
suppressed
tone
wagh
exclaimed
the
taos
likewise
but
quickly
dropped
his
arrow
point
and
eased
the
bow
what
does
my
brother
want
he
asked
that
he
lopes
like
a
wolf
round
the
fires
of
the
white
hunters
is
my
brother
skin
not
red
returned
the
apache
and
yet
he
asks
a
question
that
needs
no
answer
why
does
the
wolf
follow
the
buffalo
and
deer
for
for
blood
the
indian
follows
the
treacherous
white
from
camp
to
camp
to
strike
blow
for
blow
until
the
deaths
of
those
so
basely
killed
are
fully
my
brother
speaks
with
a
big
heart
and
his
words
are
true
and
though
the
taos
and
pimo
apache
black
their
faces
towards
each
other
are
at
war
here
on
the
graves
of
their
common
fathers
there
is
peace
between
them
let
my
brother
the
apache
moved
quickly
away
and
the
taos
once
more
sought
the
of
his
white
companions
following
the
course
of
the
gila
to
the
eastward
they
crossed
a
range
of
the
sierra
madre
which
is
a
continuation
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
struck
the
waters
of
the
rio
del
norte
below
the
settlements
of
new
mexico
on
this
stream
they
fared
well
besides
trapping
a
great
quantity
of
beaver
game
of
all
kinds
abounded
and
the
bluffs
near
the
banks
of
the
river
were
covered
with
rich
gramma
grass
on
which
their
animals
speedily
improved
in
condition
they
remained
for
some
weeks
encamped
on
the
right
bank
of
the
stream
during
which
period
they
lost
one
of
their
number
shot
with
an
arrow
whilst
lying
asleep
within
a
few
feet
of
the
the
navajos
continually
prowl
along
that
portion
of
the
river
which
runs
through
the
settlements
of
new
mexico
preying
upon
the
cowardly
inhabitants
and
running
off
with
their
cattle
whenever
they
are
exposed
in
sufficient
numbers
to
tempt
them
whilst
ascending
the
river
the
trappers
met
a
party
of
these
indians
returning
to
their
mountain
homes
with
a
large
band
of
mules
and
horses
which
they
had
taken
from
one
of
the
mexican
towns
besides
several
women
and
children
whom
they
had
captured
as
slaves
the
main
body
of
the
trappers
halting
ten
of
the
band
followed
and
charged
upon
the
indians
who
numbered
at
least
sixty
killed
seven
of
them
and
retook
the
prisoners
and
the
whole
cavallada
of
horses
and
mules
great
were
the
rejoicings
when
they
entered
socorro
the
town
whence
the
women
and
children
had
been
taken
and
as
loud
the
remonstrances
when
handing
them
over
to
their
families
the
trappers
rode
on
driving
fifty
of
the
best
of
the
rescued
animals
before
them
which
they
retained
as
payment
for
their
services
messengers
were
sent
on
to
albuquerque
with
intelligence
of
the
proceeding
and
as
troops
were
stationed
there
the
commandant
was
applied
to
to
chastise
the
insolent
whites
that
warrior
on
learning
that
the
trappers
numbered
less
than
fifteen
became
alarmingly
brave
and
ordering
out
the
whole
of
his
disposable
force
some
two
hundred
dragoons
sallied
out
to
intercept
the
audacious
mountaineers
about
noon
one
day
just
as
the
latter
had
emerged
from
a
little
town
between
socorro
and
albuquerque
they
descried
the
imposing
force
of
the
dragoons
winding
along
a
plain
ahead
as
the
trappers
advanced
the
officer
in
command
halted
his
men
and
sent
out
a
trumpeter
to
order
the
former

as
they
approached
the
soldiers
broke
into
a
trot
ten
of
the
number
forming
line
in
front
of
the
packed
and
loose
animals
and
rifle
in
hand
charging
with
loud
whoops
this
was
enough
for
the
new
mexicans
before
the
enemy
were
within
shooting
distance
the
gallant
fellows
turned
tail
and
splashed
into
the
river
dragging
themselves
up
the
opposite
bank
like
rats
and
saluted
with
loud
peels
of
laughter
by
the
victorious
mountaineers
who
firing
a
volley
into
the
air
in
token
of
supreme
contempt
quietly
continued
their
route
up
the
stream
before
reaching
the
capital
of
the
province
they
struck
again
to
the
westward
and
following
a
small
creek
to
its
junction
with
the
green
river
ascended
that
stream
trapping
to
the
uintah
or
snake
fork
and
arrived
at
roubideau
rendezvous
early
in
the
fall
where
they
quickly
disposed
of
their
peltries
and
were
once

married
a
snake
squaw
with
whom
he
crossed
the
mountains
and
proceeded
to
the
platte
through
the
bayou
salade
where
he
purchased
of
the
yutas
a
commodious
lodge
with
the
necessary
poles
and
being
now
rich
in
mules
and
horses
and
in
all
things
necessary

took
unto
himself
another
wife
as
by
mountain
law
allowed
and
thus
equipped
with
both
his
better
halves
attired
in
all
the
glory
of

he
went
his
way
rejoicing
in
a
snug
little
valley
lying
under
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
watered
by
vermilion
creek
and
in
which
abundance
of
buffalo
elk
deer
and
antelope
fed
and
fattened
on
the
rich
grass
la

raised
his
lodge
employing
himself
in
hunting
and
fully
occupying
his
wives
time
in
dressing
the
skins
of
the
many
animals
he
killed
here
he
enjoyed
himself
amazingly
until
the
commencement
of
winter
when
he
determined
to
cross
to
the
north
fork
and
trade
his
skins
of
which
he
had
now
as
many
packs
as
his
animals
could
carry
it
happened
that
he
one
day
left
his
camp
to
spend
a
couple
of
days
hunting
buffalo
in
the
mountains
whither
the
bulls
were
now
resorting
intending
to
put
out
for
platte
on
his
return
his
hunt
however
led
him
farther
into
the
mountains
than
he
anticipated
and
it
was
only
on
the
third
day
that
sundown
saw
him
enter
the
little
valley
where
his
camp
was
situated
crossing
the
creek
he
was
not
a
little
disturbed
at
seeing
fresh
indian
sign
on
the
opposite
side
which
led
in
the
direction
of
his
lodge
and
his
worst
fears
were
realised
when
on
coming
within
sight
of
the
little
plateau
where
the
conical
top
of
his
white
lodge
had
always
before
met
his
view
he
saw
nothing
but
a
blackened
mass
strewing
the
ground
and
the
burnt
ends
of
the
poles
which
had
once
supported
it

and

all
were
arapaho

lying
on

told
him
where
he
neither
fumed
nor
fretted
but
throwing
the
meat
off
his
pack
animal
and
the
saddle
from
his
horse
he
collected
the
blackened
ends
of
the
lodge
poles
and
made
a
his
beasts
to
water
and
hobbled
them
threw
a
piece
of
buffalo
meat
upon
the
coals
squatted
down
before
the
fire
and
lit
his
pipe
la
bonté
was
a
true
philosopher
notwithstanding
that
his
house
his
squaws
his
peltries
were
gone
at
one
fell
swoop
the
loss
scarcely
disturbed
his
equanimity
and
before
the
tobacco
in
his
pipe
was
half
smoked
out
he
had
ceased
to
think
of
his
misfortune
certes
as
he
turned
his
apolla
of
tender
loin
he
sighed
as
he
thought
of
the
delicate
manipulations
with
which
his
shoshone
squaw
was
wont
to
beat
to
tenderness
the
toughest
bull
missed
the
tending
care
of
yute
or
the
reed
that
bends
in
patching
the
holes
worn
in
his
neatly
fitting
moccasins
the
work
of
her
nimble
fingers
however
he
ate
and
smoked
and
smoked
and
ate
and
slept
none
the
worse
for
his
mishap
thought
before
he
closed
his
eyes
a
little
of
his
lost
wives
and
more
perhaps
of
the
bending
reed
than
of
or
she
who
runs
with
the
stream
drew
his
blanket
tightly
round
him
felt
his
rifle
handy
to
his
grasp
and
was
speedily
asleep
whilst
the
tired
mountaineer
breathes
heavily
in
his
dream
careless
and
unconscious
that
a
living
soul
is
near
his
mule
on
a
sudden
pricks
her
ears
and
stares
into
the
gloom
whence
a
figure
soon
emerges
and
with
noiseless
steps
draws
near
the
sleeping
hunter
taking
one
look
at
the
slumbering
form
the
same
figure
approaches
the
fire
and
adds
a
log
to
the
pile
which
done
it
quietly
seats
itself
at
the
feet
of
the
sleeper
and
remains
motionless
as
a
statue
towards
morning
the
hunter
awoke
and
rubbing
his
eyes
was
astonished
to
feel
the
glowing
warmth
of
the
fire
striking
on
his
naked
feet
which
in
indian
fashion
were
stretched
towards
it
as
by
this
time
he
knew
the
fire
he
left
burning
must
long
since
have
expired
lazily
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
he
saw
a
figure
sitting
near
it
with
the
back
turned
to
him
which
although
his
exclamatory
wagh
was
loud
enough
in
all
conscience
remained
perfectly
motionless
until
the
trapper
rising
placed
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
then
turning
up
its
face
the
features
displayed
to
his
wondering
eye
were
those
of
his
yuta
wife
yes
indeed
the
reed
that
bends
had
escaped
from
her
arapaho
captors
and
made
her
way
back
to
her
white
husband
fasting
and
alone
the
indian
women
who
follow
the
fortunes
of
the
white
hunters
are
remarkable
for
their
affection
and
fidelity
to
their
husbands
the
which
virtues
it
must
be
remarked
are
all
on
their
own
side
for
with
very
few
exceptions
the
mountaineers
seldom
scruple
to
abandon
their
indian
wives
whenever
the
fancy
takes
them
to
change
their
harems
and
on
such
occasions
the
squaws
thus
cast
aside
wild
with
jealousy
and
despair
have
been
not
unfrequently
known
to
take
signal
vengeance
both
on
their
faithless
husbands
and
on
the
successful
beauties
who
have
supplanted
them
in
their
affections
there
are
some
honourable
exceptions
however
to
such
cruelty
and
many
of
the
mountaineers
stick
to
their
wives
for
better
and
for
worse
often
suffering
them
to
gain
the
upper
hand
in
the
domestic
economy
of
the
lodges
and
being
ruled
by
their
better
halves
in
all
things
pertaining
to
family
affairs
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
when
once
the
lady
dons
the
unmentionables
she
becomes
the
veriest
termagant
that
ever
henpecked
an
unfortunate
husband
your
refined
trappers
however
who
after
many
years
of
bachelor
life
incline
to
take
to
themselves
a
better
half
often
undertake
an
expedition
into
the
settlements
of
new
mexico
where
not
unfrequently
they
adopt
a
very
young
lochinvar
system
in
procuring
the
required
rib

have
been
known
to
carry

the

soon
becomes
inured

women

valued
at
a
low
figure
in
the
mountains
they
are
too
fine
and
neither
can
they
make
moccasins
or
dress
skins
nor
are
they
so
schooled
to
perfect
obedience
to
their
lords
and
masters
as
to
stand
a
which
the
western
lords
of
the
creation
not
unfrequently
deem
it
their
bounden
duty
to
inflict
upon
their
squaws
for
some
dereliction
of
domestic
duty
to
return
however
to

he
once
muttered
and
was
done
packing
all
that
was
left
on
the

mounting
on
his
buffalo
horse
he
shouldered
his
rifle
and
struck
the
indian
trail
for

on

creek
they
came
upon
a
party
of
french
trappers
and
hunters
who
were
encamped
with
their
lodges
and
indian
squaws
and
formed
quite
a
village
several
old
companions
were
amongst
them
and
to
celebrate
the
arrival
of
a
camarade
a
splendid
was
prepared
in
honour
of
the
event
to
effect
this
the
squaws
sallied
out
of
their
lodges
to
seize
upon
sundry
of
the
younger
and
plumper
of
the
pack
to
fill
the
kettles
for
the
approaching
feast
with
a
presentiment
of
the
fate
in
store
for
them
the
curs
slunk
away
with
tails
between
their
legs
and
declined
the
pressing
invitations
of
the
anxious
squaws
these
shouldered
their
tomahawks
and
gave
chase
but
the
cunning
pups
outstripped
them
and
would
have
fairly
beaten
the
kettles
if
some
of
the
mountaineers
had
not
stepped
out
with
their
rifles
and
quickly
laid
ready
to
the
knife
a
cayeute
attracted
by
the
scent
of
blood
drew
near
unwitting
of
the
canine
feast
in
progress
and
was
likewise
soon
made
of
and
thrust
into
the
boiling
kettle
with
the
rest
the
feast
that
night
was
long
protracted
and
so
savoury
was
the
stew
and
so
agreeable
to
the
palates
of
the
hungry
hunters
that
at
the
moment
the
last
morsel
was
drawn
from
the
pot
when
all
were
regretting
that
a
few
more
dogs
had
not
been
slaughtered
a
cur
who
incautiously
poked
his
long
nose
and
head
under
the
lodge
skin
was
pounced
upon
by
the
nearest
hunter
who
in
a
moment
drew
his
knife
across
the
animal
throat
and
threw
it
to
a
squaw
to
skin
and
prepare
for
the
pot
the
wolf
had
long
since
been
vigorously
discussed
and
voted
by
all
hands
to
be
good
as
meat
meat
is
a
common
saying
in
the
mountains
and
from
the
buffalo
down
to
the
rattlesnake
including
every
quadruped
that
runs
every
fowl
that
flies
and
every
reptile
that
creeps
nothing
comes
amiss
to
the
mountaineer
throwing
aside
all
the
qualms
and
conscientious
scruples
of
a
fastidious
stomach
it
must
be
confessed
that
takes
a
high
rank
in
the
wonderful
variety
of
cuisine
afforded
to
the
gourmand
and
the
gourmet
by
the
prolific
now
when
the

offers
such
tempting

la
bonté
started
with
his
squaw
for
the
north
fork
early
in
november
and
arrived
at
the
laramie
at
the
moment
that
the
big
village
of
the
sioux
came
up
for
their
winter
trade
two
other
villages
were
encamped
lower
down
the
platte
including
the
brulés
and
the
who
were
now
on
more
friendly
terms
with
the
whites
the
first
band
numbered
several
hundred
lodges
and
presented
quite
an
imposing
appearance
the
village
being
laid
out
in
parallel
lines
the
lodge
of
each
chief
being
marked
with
his
particular
totem
the
traders
had
a
particular
portion
of
the
village
allotted
to
them
and
a
line
was
marked
out
which
was
strictly
kept
by
the
soldiers
appointed
for
the
protection
of
the
whites
as
there
were
many
rival
traders
and
numerous
des
or
peddling
ones
the
market
promised
to
be
brisk
the
more
so
as
a
large
quantity
of
ardent
spirits
was
in
their
possession
which
would
be
dealt
with
no
unsparing
hand
to
put
down
the
opposition
of
so
many
competing
traders
in
opening
a
trade
a
quantity
of
liquor
is
first
given
on
the
prairie
as
the
indians
express
it
in
words
or
by
signs
in
rubbing
the
palm
of
one
hand
quickly
across
the
other
holding
both
flat
having
once
tasted
the
pernicious
liquid
there
is
no
fear
but
they
will
quickly
come
to
terms
and
not
unfrequently
the
spirit
is
drugged
to
render
the
unfortunate
indians
still
more
helpless
sometimes
maddened
and
infuriated
by
drink
they
commit
the
most
horrid
atrocities
on
each
other
murdering
and
mutilating
in
a
barbarous
manner
and
often
attempting
the
lives
of
the
traders
themselves
on
one
occasion
a
band
of
sioux
whilst
under
the
influence
of
liquor
attacked
and
took
possession
of
a
trading
fort
of
the
american
fur
company
stripping
it
of
every
thing
it
contained
and
roasting
the
trader
himself
over
his
own
fire
the
principle
on
which
the
nefarious
trade
is
conducted
is
this
that
the
indians
possessing
a
certain
quantity
of
buffalo
robes
have
to
be
cheated
out
of
them
and
the
sooner
the
better
although
it
is
explicitly
prohibited
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
to
convey
spirits
across
the
indian
frontier
and
its
introduction
amongst
the
indian
tribes
subjects
the
offender
to
a
heavy
penalty
yet
the
infraction
of
this
law
is
of
daily
occurrence
perpetrated
almost
in
the
very
presence
of
the
government
officers
who
are
stationed
along
the
frontier
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
laws
for
the
protection
of
the
indians
the
misery
entailed
upon
these
unhappy
people
by
the
illicit
traffic
must
be
seen
to
be
fully
appreciated
before
the
effects
of
the
poisonous
they
disappear
from
the
earth
like
snow
before
the
although
aware
of
the
destruction
it
entails
upon
them
the
poor
wretches
have
not
moral
courage
to
shun
the
fatal
allurement
it
holds
out
to
them
of
wild
excitement
and
a
temporary
oblivion
of
their
many
sufferings
and
privations
with
such
palpable
effects
it
appears
only
likely
that
the
illegal
trade
is
connived
at
by
those
whose
policy
it
has
ever
been
gradually
but
surely
to
exterminate
the
indians
and
by
any
means
to
extinguish
their
title
to
the
few
lands
they
now
own
on
the
outskirts
of
civilisation
certain
it
is
that
large
quantities
of
liquor
find
their
way
annually
into
the
indian
country
and
as
certain
are
the
fatal
results
of
the
pernicious
system
and
that
the
american
government
takes
no
steps
to
prevent
it
there
are
some
tribes
who
have
as
yet
withstood
the
great
temptation
and
have
resolutely
refused
to
permit
liquor
to
be
brought
into
their
villages
the
marked
difference
between
the
improved
condition
of
these
and
the
moral
and
physical
abasement
of
those
which
give
way
to
the
fatal
passion
for
drinking
sufficiently
proves
the
pernicious
effects
of
the
liquor
trade
on
the
unfortunate
and
abused
aborigines
and
it
is
matter
of
regret
that
no
philanthropist
has
sprung
up
in
the
united
states
to
do
battle
for
the
rights
of
the
red
men
and
call
attention
to
the
wrongs
they
endure
at
the
hands
of
their
supplanters
in
the
lands
of
their
fathers
robbed
of
their
homes
and
and
driven
by
the
encroachments
of
the
whites
to
distant
regions
which
hardly
support
existence
the
indians
day
by
day
gradually
decrease
before
the
accumulating
evils
of
body
and
soul
which
their
civilised
persecutors
entail
upon
them
with
every
man
hand
against
them
they
drag
on
to
their
final
destiny
and
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
the
american
indian
will
exist
only
in
the
traditions
of
his
conquerors
the
indians
trading
at
this
time
on
the
platte
were
mostly
of
the
sioux
nation
including
the
tribes
of
assinaboins
oglallahs
broken
arrows
all
of
which
belong
to
the
great
sioux
nation
or
as
they
call
themselves
and
which
means
there
were
also
some
cheyennes
allied
to
the
sioux
as
well
as
a
small
band
of
republican
pawnees
gambling
and
served
to
pass
away
the
time
until
the
trade
commenced

amongst
themselves

playing
at
the
usual
game
of
the
stakes
comprising
all
the
valuables
the
players
possess

piled
in
two
heaps
close
at

the
winner
at
the
conclusion
of
the
game
sweeping
the
goods
towards
him
and
often
returning
a
small
portion
on
the
prairie
with
which
the
loser
may
again
commence
operations
with
another
player
the
game

is
played
by
two
persons
one
who
commences
places
a
plum
or
in
the
hollow
formed
by
joining
the
concaved
palms
of
the
hands
together
then
shaking
the
stone
for
a
few
moments
the
hands
are
suddenly
separated
and
the
other
player
must
guess
which
hand
now
contains
the
stone
large
bets
are
often
wagered
on
the
result
of
this
favourite
game
which
is
also
often
played
by
the
squaws
the
men
standing
round
encouraging
them
to
bet
and
laughing
loudly
at
their
grotesque
excitement
a
sioux
one
of
the
bravest
chiefs
of
his
tribe
was
out
when
a
young
man
on
a
solitary
war
expedition
against
the
crows
one
evening
he
drew
near
a
certain
medicine
spring
where
to
his
astonishment
he
encountered
a
crow
warrior
in
the
act
of
quenching
his
thirst
he
was
on
the
point
of
drawing
his
bow
upon
him
when
he
remembered
the
sacred
nature
of
the
spot
and
making
the
sign
of
peace
he
fearlessly
drew
near
his
foe
and
proceeded
likewise
to
slake
his
thirst
a
pipe
of
being
produced
it
was
proposed
to
pass
away
the
early
part
of
the
night
in
a
game
of
they
accordingly
sat
down
beside
the
spring
and
commenced
the
game
fortune
favoured
the
crow
he
won
arrow
after
arrow
from
the
brave
then
his
bow
his
club
his
knife
his
robe
all
followed
and
the
sioux
sat
naked
on
the
plain
still
he
proposed
another
stake
against
the
other
scalp
he
played
and
lost
and
bending
forward
his
head
the
crow
warrior
drew
his
knife
and
quickly
removed
the
bleeding
prize
without
a
murmur
the
luckless
sioux
rose
to
depart
but
first
exacted
a
promise
from
his
antagonist
that
he
would
meet
him
once
more
at
the
same
spot
and
engage
in
another
trial
of
skill
on
the
day
appointed
the
sought
the
spot
with
a
new
equipment
and
again
the
crow
made
his
appearance
and
they
sat
down
to
play
this
time
fortune
changed
sides
the
sioux
won
back
his
former
losses
and
in
his
turn
the
crow
was
stripped
to
his
skin
scalp
against
scalp
was
now
the
stake
and
this
time
the
crow
submitted
his
head
to
the
victorious
knife
and
both
the
warriors
stood
scalpless
on
the
plain
and
now
the
crow
had
but
one
single
stake
of
value
to
offer
and
the
offer
of
it
he
did
not
hesitate
to
make
he
staked
his
life
against
the
other
winnings
they
played
and
fortune
still
being
adverse
he
lost
he
offered
his
breast
to
his
adversary
the
plunged
his
knife
into
his
heart
to
the
very
hilt
and
laden
with
his
spoils
returned
to
his
village
and
to
this
day
wears
suspended
from
his
ears
his
own
and
enemy
scalp
the
village
presented
the
usual
scene
of
confusion
as
long
as
the
trade
lasted
fighting
brawling
yelling
dancing
and
all
the
concomitants
of
intoxication
continued
to
the
last
drop
of
the
when
the
reaction
after
such
excitement
was
almost
worse
than
the
evil
itself
during
this
time
all
the
work
devolved
upon
the
squaws
who
in
tending
the
horses
and
in
packing
wood
and
water
from
a
long
distance
had
their
time
sufficiently
occupied
as
there
was
little
or
no
grass
in
the
vicinity
the
animals
were
supported
entirely
on
the
bark
of
the
and
to
procure
this
the
women
were
daily
engaged
in
felling
huge
trees
or
climbing
them
fearlessly
chopping
off
the
upper
like
squirrels
from
branch
to
branch
which
in
their
confined
costume
appeared
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
the
most
scenes
however
were
when
a
number
of
squaws
sallied
out
to
the
grove
with
their
dogs
harnessed
to
their
or
trabogans
on
which
loads
of
were
piled
the
dogs
knowing
full
well
the
duty
required
of
them
refuse
to
approach
the
coaxing
squaws
and
at
the
same
time
are
fearful
of
provoking
their
anger
by
escaping
and
running
off
they
therefore
squat
on
their
haunches
with
tongues
hanging
out
of
their
long
mouths
the
picture
of
indecision
removing
a
short
distance
as
the
irate
squaw
approaches
when
once
harnessed
to
the
travée
however
which
is
simply
a
couple
of
lashed
on
either
side
of
the
dog
with
a
couple
of
near
the
ends
to
support
the
freight
they
follow
quietly
enough
urged
by
bevies
of
children
who
invariably
accompany
the
women
once
arrived
at
the
scene
of
their
labours
the
reluctance
of
the
curs
to
draw
near
the
piles
of
is
most
comical
they
will
lie
down
stubbornly
at
a
little
distance
whining
their
uneasiness
or
sometimes
scamper
off
bodily
with
their
long
poles
trailing
after
them
pursued
by
the
yelling
and
half
frantic
squaws
when
the
travées
are
laden
the
squaws
bent
double
under
loads
of
wood
sufficient
to
break
a
porter
back
and
calling
to
the
dogs
which
are
urged
on
by
the
urchins
in
rear
lead
the
line
of
march
the
curs
taking
advantage
of
the
helpless
state
of
their
mistresses
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
their
coaxings
lying
down
every
few
yards
to
rest
growling
and
fighting
with
each
other
in
which
encounters
every
cur
joins
the
charging
into
the
yelping
throng
upsetting
the
squalling
children
and
making
confusion
worse
confounded
then
armed
with
the
squaws
throwing
down
their
loads
rush
to
the
rescue
dealing
stalwart
blows
on
the
pugnacious
curs
and
finally
restoring
something
like
order
to
the
march
they
cry
wah
kashne
on
you
devilish
and
belabouring
them
without
mercy
they
start
them
into
a
gallop
which
once
commenced
is
generally
continued
till
they
reach
their
destination
the
indian
dogs
are
however
invariably
well
treated
by
the
squaws
since
they
assist
materially
the
labours
of
these
patient
creatures
in
hauling
firewood
to
the
lodge
and
on
the
line
of
march
carrying
many
of
the
household
goods
and
chattels
which
otherwise
the
squaw
herself
would
have
to
carry
on
her
back

lodge
possesses

a

draught
and
others
for

and
parcel
of
an
indian
feast
the
former
are
stout
wiry
animals
half
wolf
half
and
are
regularly
trained
to
draught
the
latter
are
of
a
smaller
kind
more
inclined
to
fat
and
embrace
every
variety
of
the
genus
cur
many
of
the
southern
tribes
possess
a
breed
of
dogs
entirely
divested
of
hair
which
evidently
have
come
from
south
america
and
are
highly
esteemed
for
the
kettle
their
meat
in
appearance
and
flavour
resembles
young
pork
but
far
surpasses
it
in
richness
and
delicacy
the
sioux
are
very
expert
in
making
their
lodges
comfortable
taking
more
pains
in
their
construction
than
most
indians
they
are
all
of
conical
form

framework
of
straight
slender
poles

which
the

of

about
twelve

fourteen
skins
and
contains
comfortably
a

of

in

the

is
made
in

centre
immediately
under
the
aperture
in
the
roof
and
a
flap
of

set
of
will
last
from
three
to
seven
years
unless
the
village
is
constantly
on
the
move
when
they
are
soon
worn
out
in
trailing
over
the
gravelly
prairie
they
are
usually
of
ash
which
grows
on
many
of
the
mountain
creeks
and
regular
expeditions
are
undertaken
when
a
supply
is
required
either
for
their
own
lodges
or
for
trading
with
those
tribes
who
inhabit
the
prairies
at
a
great
distance
from
the
locality
where
the
poles
are
procured
there
are
also
certain
creeks
where
the
indians
resort
to
lay
in
a
store
of
the
inner
bark
of
the
red
willow
which
they
use
as
a
substitute
for
tobacco
and
which
has
an
aromatic
and
very
pungent
flavour
it
is
prepared
for
smoking
by
being
scraped
in
thin
curly
flakes
from
the
slender
saplings
and
crisped
before
the
fire
after
which
it
is
rubbed
between
the
hands
into
a
form
resembling
and
stored
in
skin
bags
for
use
it
has
a
highly
narcotic
effect
on
those
not
habituated
to
its
use
and
produces
a
heaviness
sometimes
approaching
stupefaction
altogether
different
from
the
soothing
effects
of
tobacco
every
year
owing
to
the
disappearance
of
the
buffalo
from
their
former
haunts
the
indians
are
compelled
to
encroach
upon
each
other
which
is
a
fruitful
cause
of
war
between
the
different
tribes
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
buffalo
retire
before
the
whites
whilst
the
presence
of
indians
in
their
pastures
appears
in
no
degree
to
disturb
them
wherever
a
few
white
hunters
are
congregated
in
a
trading
port
or
elsewhere
so
sure
it
is
that
if
they
remain
in
the
same
locality
the
buffalo
will
desert
the
vicinity
and
seek
pasture
elsewhere
in
this
the
indians
affirm
the
or
bad
medicine
of
the
is
very
apparent
and
they
ground
upon
it
their
complaints
of
the
encroachments
made
upon
their
by
the
white
hunters
in
the
winter
many
of
the
tribes
are
reduced
to
the
very
verge
of
buffalo
having
passed
from
their
country
into
that
of
their
enemies
when
no
other
alternative
is
offered
them
but
to
remain
where
they
are
and
starve
or
to
follow
the
game
into
a
hostile
region
a
move
entailing
war
and
all
its
horrors
reckless
moreover
of
the
future
in
order
to
prepare
robes
for
the
traders
and
to
procure
the
pernicious
they
wantonly
slaughter
every
year
vast
numbers
of
buffalo
cows
the
skins
of
which
sex
only
are
dressed
and
thus
add
to
the
evils
in
store
for
them
when
questioned
on
this
subject
and
reproached
with
such
want
of
foresight
they
answer
that
however
quickly
the
buffalo
disappears
the
red
man
goes
under
more
quickly
still
and
that
the
great
spirit
has
ordained
that
both
shall
be
rubbed
out
from
the
face
of
nature
at
one
and
the
same
time
that
arrows
and
bullets
are
not
more
fatal
to
the
buffalo
than
the
and
to
them
and
that
before
many
winters
snows
have
disappeared
the
buffalo
and
the
red
man
will
only
be
remembered
by
their
bones
which
will
strew
the
they
look
forward
however
to
a
future
state
when
after
a
long
journey
they
will
reach
the
happy
where
buffalo
will
once
more
blacken
the
prairies
where
the
dare
not
come
to
disturb
them
where
no
winter
snows
cover
the
ground
and
the
buffalo
are
always
plentiful
and
as
soon
as
the
streams
opened
la
bonté
now
reduced
to
two
animals
and
four
traps
sallied
forth
again
this
time
seeking
the
dangerous
country
of
the
blackfeet
on
the
head
waters
of
the
yellow
stone
and
upper
missouri
he
was
accompanied
by
three
others
a
man
named
wheeler
and
one
a
swede
who
had
been
many
years
in
the
western
country
reaching
the
forks
of
a
small
creek
on
both
of
which
appeared
plenty
of
beaver
sign
la
bonté
followed
the
one
alone
whilst
the
others
trapped
the
right
in
company
the
former
leaving
his
squaw
in
the
company
of
a
sioux
woman
who
followed
the
fortunes
of
the
party
agreeing
to
rendezvous
at
the
junction
of
the
two
forks
as
soon
as
they
had
trapped
to
their
heads
and
again
descended
them
the
larger
party
were
the
first
to
reach
the
rendezvous
and
camped
on
the
banks
of
the
main
stream
to
await
the
arrival
of
la
bonté
the
morning
after
their
return
they
had
just
risen
from
their
blankets
and
were
lazily
stretching
themselves
before
the
fire
when
a
volley
of
firearms
rattled
from
the
bank
of
the
creek
and
two
of
their
number
fell
dead
to
the
ground
whilst
at
the
same
moment
the
deafening
yells
of
indians
broke
upon
the
ears
of
the
frightened
squaws
seized
his
rifle
and
though
severely
wounded
rushed
to
the
cover
of
a
hollow
tree
which
stood
near
and
crawling
into
it
defended
himself
the
whole
day
with
the
greatest
obstinacy
killing
five
indians
outright
and
wounding
several
more
unable
to
drive
the
gallant
trapper
from
his
retreat
the
savages
took
advantage
of
a
favourable
wind
which
suddenly
sprang
up
and
fired
the
long
dry
grass
surrounding
the
tree
the
rotten
log
catching
fire
at
length
compelled
the
hunter
to
leave
his
retreat
clubbing
his
rifle
he
charged
amongst
the
indians
and
fell
at
last
pierced
through
and
through
with
wounds
but
not
until
two
more
of
his
assailants
had
fallen
by
his
hand
the
two
squaws
were
carried
off
and
one
was
sold
shortly
afterwards
to
some
white
men
at
the
trading
ports
on
the
platte
but
la
bonté
never
recovered
the
bending
reed
nor
even
heard
of
her
existence
from
that
day
so
once
more
was
the
mountaineer
bereft
of
his
better
half
and
when
he
returned
to
the
rendezvous
a
troop
of
wolves
were
feasting
on
the
bodies
of
his
late
companions
and
of
the
indians
killed
in
the
affray
of
which
he
only
heard
the
particulars
a
long
time
after
from
a
trapper
who
had
been
present
when
one
of
the
squaws
was
offered
at
the
trading
post
for
sale
and
had
heard
her
recount
the
miserable
fate
of
her
husband
and
his
companions
on
the
forks
of
the
creek
which
from
the
fact
of
la
bonté
being
the
leader
of
the
party
has
since
borne
his
name
undaunted
by
this
misfortune
the
trapper
continued
his
solitary
hunt
passing
through
the
midst
of
the
crow
and
blackfeet
country
encountering
many
perils
often
hunted
by
the
indians
but
always
escaping
he
had
soon
loaded
both
his
animals
with
beaver
and
then
thought
of
bending
his
steps
to
some
of
the
trading
rendezvous
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
where
employés
of
the
great
fur
company
meet
the
trappers
with
the
produce
of
their
hunts
on
lewis
fork
of
the
columbia
or
one
of
its
numerous
affluents
his
intention
was
to
pass
the
winter
at
some
of
the
company
trading
posts
in
oregon
into
which
country
he
had
never
yet
penetrated
chapter
we
have
said
that
la
bonté
was
a
philosopher
he
took
the
streaks
of
ill
luck
which
checkered
his
mountain
life
with
perfect
carelessness
if
not
with
stoical
indifference
nothing
ruffled
his
equanimity
of
temper
no
sudden
emotion
disturbed
his
mind
we
have
seen
how
wives
were
torn
from
him
without
eliciting
a
groan
or
grumble
but
such
it
may
be
said
can
scarcely
find
a
place
in
the
category
of
ills
how
the
loss
of
mules
and
mustangs
harried
by
indians
left
him
in
the
of
mountain
afoot
how
packs
and
peltries
the
beaver
of
his
perilous
hunts
were
raised
at
one
fell
swoop
by
bands
of
savages
hunger
and
thirst
we
know
were
commonplace
sensations
to
the
mountaineer
his
flesh
scarce
felt
the
pinging
wounds
of
or
bullet
and
when
in
the
midst
of
indian
fight
it
is
not
probable
that
any
tender
qualms
of
feeling
would
allay
the
itching
of
his
fingers
for
his
nor
would
any
remains
of
civilised
fastidiousness
prevent
his
burying
his
knife
again
and
again
in
the
of
an
indian
savage
still
in
one
dark
corner
of
his
heart
there
shone
at
intervals
a
faint
spark
of
what
was
once
a
fire
neither
time
that
corroder
of
all
things
nor
change
that
ready
abettor
of
oblivion
nor
scenes
of
peril
and
excitement
which
act
as
dampers
to
more
quiet
memories
could
smother
this
little
smouldering
spark
which
now
and
calm
succeeded
some
stirring
passage
in
the
hunter
life
and
left
him
for
a
brief
time
devoid
of
care
and
victim
to
his
flicker
suddenly
and
light
up
all
the
nooks
and
corners
of
his
rugged
breast
and
discover
to
his
mind
eye
that
one
memory
clung
there
still
though
long
neglected
proving
that
spite
of
time
and
change
of
life
and
fortune
on
revient
toujours
à
ses
premiers
often
and
often
as
la
bonté
sat
before
his
solitary
and
pipe
in
mouth
watched
the
blue
smoke
curling
upwards
in
the
clear
cold
sky
a
form
appeared
to
gaze
upon
him
from
the
vapoury
wreaths
then
would
old
recollections
crowd
before
him
and
old
emotions
long
a
stranger
to
his
breast
shape
themselves
as
it
were
into
but
now
familiar
pulsations
again
he
felt
the
soft
subduing
influence
which
once
in
days
gone
by
a
certain
passion
exercised
over
his
mind
and
body
and
often
a
trembling
seized
him
the
same
he
used
to
experience
at
the
sudden
sight
of
one
mary
brand
whose
dim
and
dreamy
apparition
so
often
watched
his
lonely
bed
or
unconsciously
conjured
up
cheered
him
in
the
dreary
watches
of
the
long
and
stormy
winter
nights
at
first
he
only
knew
that
one
face
haunted
his
dreams
by
night
and
the
few
moments
by
day
when
he
thought
of
any
thing
and
this
face
smiled
lovingly
upon
him
and
cheered
him
mightily
name
he
had
quite
forgotten
or
recalled
it
vaguely
and
setting
small
store
by
it
had
thought
of
it
no
more
for
many
years
after
he
had
deserted
his
home
la
bonté
had
cherished
the
idea
of
again
returning
to
his
country
during
this
period
he
had
never
forgotten
his
old
flame
and
many
a
choice
fur
he
had
carefully
laid
by
intended
as
a
present
for
mary
brand
and
many
a
of
cunning
shape
and
device
worked
in
stained
quills
of
porcupine
and
handiwork
of
had
packed
in
his
possible
sack
for
the
same
destination
hoping
a
time
would
come
when
he
might
lay
them
at
her
feet
year
after
year
wore
on
however
and
still
found
him
with
traps
and
rifle
following
his
perilous
avocation
and
each
succeeding
one
saw
him
more
and
more
wedded
to
the
wild
he
was
conscious
how
unfitted
he
had
become
again
to
enter
the
galling
harness
of
conventionality
and
civilisation
he
thought
too
how
changed
in
manners
and
appearance
he
now
must
be
and
could
not
believe
that
he
would
again
find
favour
in
the
eyes
of
his
quondam
love
who
he
judged
had
long
since
forgotten
him
and
inexperienced
as
he
was
in
such
matters
yet
he
knew
enough
of
womankind
to
feel
assured
that
time
and
absence
had
long
since
done
the
work
if
even
the
natural
fickleness
of
woman
nature
had
lain
dormant
thus
it
was
that
he
came
to
forget
mary
brand
but
still
remembered
the
feeling
she
had
once
created
in
his
breast
the
shadow
of
which
still
remained
and
often
took
form
and
feature
in
the
of
his
solitary
if
truth
be
told
la
bonté
had
his
failings
as
a
mountaineer
unpardonable
in
hunter
possessed
in
holes
and
corners
of
his
breast
seldom
explored
by
his
inward
eye
much
of
the
leaven
of
kindly
human
nature
which
now
and
again
involuntarily
peeped
out
as
greatly
to
the
contempt
of
his
comrade
trappers
as
it
was
blushingly
repressed
by
the
mountaineer
himself
thus
in
his
various
matrimonial
episodes
he
treated
his
dusky
with
all
the
consideration
the
sex
could
possibly
demand
from
hand
of
man
no
squaw
of
his
ever
humped
shoulder
to
receive
a
castigatory
and
marital
for
offence
domestic
but
often
has
his
helpmate
blushed
to
see
her
lord
and
master
devote
himself
to
the
feminine
labour
of
packing
huge
piles
of
on
his
back
felling
trees
butchering
unwieldy
which
are
included
in
the
indian
category
of
female
duties
thus
he
was
esteemed
an
excellent
by
all
the
marriageable
young
squaws
of
blackfoot
crow
and
shoshone
of
yutah
shian
and
arapaho
but
after
his
last
connubial
catastrophe
he
steeled
his
heart
against
all
the
charms
and
coquetry
of
indian
belles
and
persevered
in
unblessed
widowhood
for
many
a
long
day
from
the
point
where
we
left
him
on
his
way
to
the
waters
of
the
columbia
we
must
jump
with
him
over
a
space
of
nearly
two
years
during
which
time
he
had
a
most
uninterrupted
run
of
good
luck
trapping
with
great
success
on
the
head
streams
of
the
columbia
and
yellow
most
dangerous
of
trapping
finding
good
market
for
his
peltries
at
the
fetching
as
high
a
price
as
five
and
six
dollars
a
plew
golden
age
of
trappers
now
alas
never
to
return
and
existing
only
in
the
fond
memory
of
the
mountaineers
this
glorious
time
however
was
too
good
to
last
in
mountain
language
such
heap
of
fat
meat
was
not
going
to
much
la
bonté
was
at
this
time
one
of
a
band
of
eight
trappers
whose
hunting
ground
was
about
the
head
waters
of
the
yellow
stone
which
we
have
before
said
is
in
the
country
of
the
blackfeet
with
him
were
killbuck
meek
marcellin
and
three
others
and
the
leader
of
the
party
was
bill
williams
that
old
hard
case
who
had
spent
forty
years
and
more
in
the
mountains
until
he
had
become
as
tough
as
the
parflêche
soles
of
his
moccasins
they
were
all
good
men
and
true
expert
hunters
and
mountaineers
after
having
trapped
all
the
streams
they
were
acquainted
with
it
was
determined
to
strike
into
the
mountains
at
a
point
where
old
williams
affirmed
from
the
run
of
the
hills
there
must
be
plenty
of
water
although
not
one
of
the
party
had
before
explored
the
country
or
knew
any
thing
of
its
nature
or
of
the
likelihood
of
its
affording
game
for
themselves
or
pasture
for
their
animals
however
they
packed
their
peltry
and
put
out
for
the
land
in
lofty
peak
dimly
seen
above
the
more
regular
summit
of
the
chain
being
their
landmark
for
the
first
day
or
two
their
route
lay
between
two
ridges
of
mountains
and
by
following
the
little
valley
which
skirted
a
creek
they
kept
on
level
ground
and
saved
their
animals
considerable
labour
and
fatigue
williams
always
rode
ahead
his
body
bent
over
his
across
which
rested
a
long
heavy
rifle
his
keen
gray
eyes
peering
from
under
the
slouched
brim
of
a
flexible
black
and
shining
with
grease
his
buckskin
bedaubed
until
it
had
the
appearance
of
polished
leather
hung
in
folds
over
his
bony
carcass
his
nether
extremities
being
clothed
in
pantaloons
of
the
same
material
with
scattered
fringes
down
the
outside
of
the
ornaments
however
had
been
pretty
well
thinned
to
supply
whangs
for
mending
moccasins
or
which
shrunk
with
wet
clung
tightly
to
his
long
spare
sinewy
legs
his
feet
were
thrust
into
a
pair
of
mexican
stirrups
made
of
wood
and
as
big
as
and
iron
spurs
of
incredible
proportions
with
tinkling
drops
attached
to
the
rowels
were
fastened
to
his
strap
four
inches
broad
securing
them
over
the
instep
in
the
which
sustained
his
and
were
fastened
the
various
instruments
essential
to
one
pursuing
his
mode
of
life
an
awl
with
handle
and
the
point
defended
by
a
case
of
carved
by
his
own
hand
hung
at
the
back
of
the
belt
side
by
side
with
a
worm
for
cleaning
the
rifle
and
under
this
was
a
squat
and
the
handles
guarded
by
strips
of
buckskin
to
save
his
fingers
from
burning
when
running
balls
having
for
its
companion
a
little
bottle
made
from
the
point
of
an
antelope
horn
scraped
transparent
which
contained
the
medicine
used
in
baiting
the
traps
the
old
coon
face
was
sharp
and
thin
a
long
nose
and
chin
each
other
and
his
head
was
always
bent
forward
giving
him
the
appearance
of
being
he
to
look
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
but
in
fact
his
little
twinkling
eye
was
everywhere
he
looked
at
no
one
he
was
addressing
always
seeming
to
be
thinking
of
something
else
than
the
subject
of
his
discourse
speaking
in
a
whining
thin
cracked
voice
and
in
a
tone
that
left
the
hearer
in
doubt
whether
he
was
laughing
or
crying
on
the
present
occasion
he
had
joined
this
band
and
naturally
assumed
the
leadership
for
bill
ever
refused
to
go
in
harness
in
opposition
to
his
usual
practice
which
was
to
hunt
alone
his
character
was
well
known
acquainted
with
every
inch
of
the
far
west
and
with
all
the
indian
tribes
who
inhabited
it
he
never
failed
to
outwit
his
red
enemies
and
generally
made
his
appearance
at
the
rendezvous
from
his
solitary
expeditions
with
galore
of
beaver
when
numerous
bands
of
trappers
dropped
in
on
foot
having
been
despoiled
of
their
packs
and
animals
by
the
very
indians
through
the
midst
of
whom
old
williams
had
contrived
to
pass
unseen
and
unmolested
on
occasions
when
he
had
been
in
company
with
others
and
attacked
by
indians
bill
invariably
fought
manfully
and
with
all
the
coolness
that
perfect
indifference
to
death
or
danger
could
give
but
always
on
his
own
his
rifle
cracked
away
merrily
and
never
spoke
in
vain
and
in
a
ever
it
came
to
tickled
the
fleece
of
many
a
blackfoot
but
at
the
same
time
if
he
saw
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valour
and
affairs
wore
so
cloudy
an
aspect
as
to
render
retreat
advisable
he
would
first
express
his
opinion
in
curt
terms
and
decisively
and
charging
up
his
rifle
would
take
himself
off
and
câche
so
effectually
that
to
search
for
him
was
utterly
useless
thus
when
with
a
large
party
of
trappers
when
any
thing
occurred
which
gave
him
a
hint
that
trouble
was
coming
or
more
indians
were
about
than
he
considered
good
for
his
animals
bill
was
wont
to
do
hyar
now
boys
thar
sign
about
this
hos
feels
like
caching
and
without
more
words
and
stoically
deaf
to
all
remonstrances
he
would
forthwith
proceed
to
pack
his
animals
talking
the
while
to
an
old
pony
his
own
particular
who
in
dogged
temper
and
iron
hardiness
was
a
worthy
companion
of
his
master
this
beast
as
bill
seized
his
apishamore
to
lay
upon
its
galled
back
would
express
displeasure
by
humping
its
back
and
shaking
its
withers
with
a
wincing
motion
that
always
excited
the
ire
of
the
old
trapper
and
no
sooner
had
he
laid
the
apishamore
smoothly
on
the
chafed
skin
than
a
wriggle
of
the
animal
shook
it
off
do
hyar
now
you
darned
crittur
he
would
whine
out
keep
quiet
your
old
fleece
now
is
this
old
coon
putting
out
to
save
from
the
darned
injuns
now
do
hyar
and
then
continuing
his
work
and
taking
no
notice
of
his
comrades
who
stood
by
bantering
the
eccentric
old
trapper
he
would
do
hyar
now
this
niggur
sees

does
he
be

if

all
about

at
that
ca
come
round
this
ca
wagh
and
at
last
his
pack
animals
securely
tied
to
the
tail
of
his
horse
he
would
mount
and
throwing
the
rifle
across
the
horn
of
his
saddle
and
without
noticing
his
companions
would
drive
the
jingling
spurs
into
his
horse
gaunt
sides
and
muttering
come
round
this
ca
would
ride
away
and
nothing
more
would
be
seen
or
heard
of
him
perhaps
for
months
when
they
would
not
unfrequently
themselves
bereft
of
animals
in
the
scrape
he
had
foreseen
find
him
located
in
some
solitary
valley
in
his
lonely
camp
with
his
animals
securely
picketed
around
and
his
peltries
safe
however
if
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
keep
company
with
a
party
all
felt
perfectly
secure
under
his
charge
his
iron
frame
defied
fatigue
and
at
night
his
love
for
himself
and
his
own
animals
was
sufficient
guarantee
that
the
camp
would
be
well
guarded
as
he
rode
ahead
his
spurs
jingling
and
thumping
the
sides
of
his
old
horse
at
every
step
he
managed
with
admirable
dexterity
to
take
advantage
of
the
best
line
of
country
to
the
gullies
and
cañons
and
broken
ground
which
would
otherwise
have
impeded
his
advance
this
tact
appeared
instinctive
for
he
looked
neither
right
nor
left
whilst
continuing
a
course
as
straight
as
possible
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
in
selecting
a
camping
site
he
displayed
equal
skill
wood
water
and
grass
began
to
fill
his
thoughts
towards
sundown
and
when
these
three
requisites
for
a
camping
ground
presented
themselves
old
bill
sprang
from
his
saddle
unpacked
his
animals
in
a
twinkling
and
hobbled
them
struck
fire
and
ignited
a
few
chips
leaving
the
rest
to
pack
in
the
wood
lit
his
pipe
and
enjoyed
himself
on
one
occasion
when
passing
through
the
valley
they
had
come
upon
a
band
of
fine
buffalo
cows
and
shortly
after
camping
two
of
the
party
rode
in
with
a
good
supply
of
fat
fleece
one
of
the
party
was
a
greenhorn
on
his
first
hunt
fresh
from
a
fort
on
platte
and
as
yet
uninitiated
in
the
mysteries
of
mountain
cooking
bill
lazily
smoking
his
pipe
called
to
him
as
he
happened
to
be
nearest
to
butcher
off
a
piece
of
meat
and
put
it
in
his
pot
markhead
seized
the
fleece
and
commenced
innocently
carving
off
a
huge
ration
when
a
gasping
roar
from
the
old
trapper
caused
him
to
drop
his
knife
growled
bill
do
hyar
now
you
darned
greenhorn
do
spile
fat
cow
like
that
whar
you
was
raised
them
doins
wont
shine
in
this
crowd
boy
do
hyar
darned
you
what
butcher
meat
across
the
grain
why
whar
the
blood
be
goin
to
you
precious
spaniard
down
the
grain
i
say
he
continued
in
a
severe
tone
of
rebuke
and
let
your
flaps
be
long
or
out
the
juice
run
hyar
now
but
this
heretical
error
nearly
cost
the
old
trapper
his
appetite
and
all
night
long
he
grumbled
his
horror
at
seeing
fat
cow
spiled
in
that
when
two
or
three
days
journey
brought
them
to
the
end
of
the
valley
and
they
commenced
the
passage
of
the
mountain
their
march
was
obstructed
by
all
kinds
of
obstacles
although
they
had
chosen
what
appeared
to
be
a
gap
in
the
chain
and
what
was
in
fact
the
only
practicable
passage
in
that
vicinity
they
followed
the
cañon
of
a
branch
of
the
yellow
stone
where
it
entered
the
mountain
but
from
this
point
it
became
a
torrent
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
incredible
exertions
that
they
reached
the
summit
of
the
ridge
game
was
exceedingly
scarce
in
the
vicinity
and
they
suffered
extremely
from
hunger
having
on
more
than
one
occasion
recourse
to
the
parflêche
soles
of
their
moccasins
to
allay
its
pangs
old
bill
however
never
grumbled
he
chewed
away
at
his
shoes
with
relish
even
and
as
long
as
he
had
a
pipeful
of
tobacco
in
his
pouch
was
a
happy
man
starvation
was
as
yet
far
off
for
all
their
animals
were
in
existence
but
as
they
were
in
a
country
where
it
was
difficult
to
procure
a
remount
each
trapper
hesitated
to
sacrifice
one
of
his
horses
to
his
appetite
from
the
summit
of
the
ridge
bill
recognised
the
country
on
the
opposite
side
to
that
whence
they
had
just
ascended
as
familiar
to
him
and
pronounced
it
to
be
full
of
beaver
as
well
as
abounding
in
the
less
desirable
commodity
of
indians
this
was
the
valley
lying
about
the
lakes
now
called
eustis
and
biddle
in
which
are
many
thermal
and
mineral
springs
well
known
to
the
trappers
by
the
names
of
the
soda
beer
and
brimstone
springs
and
regarded
by
them
with
no
little
awe
and
curiosity
as
being
the
of
his
satanic
moreover
to
be
the
biggest
kind
of
medicine
to
be
found
in
the
mountains
if
truth
be
told
old
bill
hardly
relished
the
idea
of
entering
this
country
which
he
pronounced
to
be
of
bad
medicine
notoriety
but
nevertheless
agreed
to
guide
them
to
the
best
trapping
ground
one
day
they
reached
a
creek
full
of
beaver
sign
and
determined
to
halt
here
and
establish
their
headquarters
while
they
trapped
in
the
neighbourhood
we
must
here
observe
that
at
this
was
one
of
considerable
rivalry
amongst
the
various
trading
companies
in
the
indian
indians
having
become
possessed
of
arms
and
ammunition
in
great
quantities
had
grown
unusually
daring
and
persevering
in
their
attacks
on
the
white
hunters
who
passed
through
their
country
and
consequently
the
trappers
were
compelled
to
roam
about
in
larger
bands
for
mutual
protection
which
although
it
made
them
less
liable
to
open
attack
yet
rendered
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
pursue
their
calling
without
being
discovered
for
where
one
or
two
men
might
pass
unseen
the
broad
trail
of
a
large
party
with
its
animals
was
not
likely
to
escape
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
cunning
savages
they
had
scarcely
encamped
when
the
old
leader
who
had
sallied
out
a
short
distance
from
camp
to
reconnoitre
the
neighbourhood
returned
with
an
indian
moccasin
in
his
hand
and
informed
his
companions
that
its
late
owner
and
others
were
about
do
hyar
now
boys
thar
knocking
round
and
blackfoot
at
that
but
thar
plenty
of
beaver
too
and
this
child
means
trapping
any
his
companions
were
anxious
to
leave
such
dangerous
vicinity
but
the
old
fellow
contrary
to
his
usual
caution
determined
to
remain
where
he
that
there
were
indians
all
over
the
country
for
that
matter
and
as
they
had
determined
to
hunt
here
he
had
made
up
his
mind
was
conclusive
and
all
agreed
to
stop
where
they
were
in
spite
of
the
indians
la
bonté
killed
a
couple
of
mountain
sheep
close
to
camp
and
they
feasted
rarely
on
the
fat
mutton
that
night
and
were
unmolested
by
marauding
blackfeet
the
next
morning
leaving
two
of
their
number
in
camp
they
started
in
parties
of
two
to
hunt
for
beaver
sign
and
set
their
traps
markhead
paired
with
one
batiste
killbuck
and
la
bonté
formed
another
couple
meek
and
marcellin
another
two
canadians
trapped
together
and
bill
williams
and
another
remained
to
guard
the
camp
but
this
last
leaving
bill
mending
his
moccasins
started
off
to
kill
a
mountain
sheep
a
band
of
which
animals
was
visible
markhead
and
his
companion
the
first
couple
on
the
list
followed
a
creek
which
entered
that
on
which
they
had
encamped
about
ten
miles
distant
beaver
sign
was
abundant
and
they
had
set
eight
traps
when
markhead
came
suddenly
upon
fresh
indian
sign
where
squaws
had
passed
through
the
shrubbery
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
to
procure
water
as
he
knew
from
observing
a
large
stone
placed
by
them
in
the
stream
on
which
to
stand
to
enable
them
to
dip
their
kettles
in
the
deepest
water
beckoning
to
his
companion
to
follow
and
cocking
his
rifle
he
carefully
pushed
aside
the
bushes
and
noiselessly
proceeded
up
the
bank
when
creeping
on
hands
and
knees
he
gained
the
top
and
looking
from
his
descried
three
indian
huts
standing
on
a
little
plateau
near
the
creek
smoke
curled
from
the
roofs
of
branches
but
the
skin
doors
were
carefully
closed
so
that
he
was
unable
to
distinguish
the
number
of
the
inmates
at
a
little
distance
however
he
observed
two
or
three
squaws
gathering
wood
with
the
usual
attendance
of
curs
whose
acuteness
in
detecting
the
scent
of
strangers
was
much
to
be
dreaded
markhead
was
a
rash
and
daring
young
fellow
caring
no
more
for
indians
than
he
did
for
prairie
dogs
and
acting
ever
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
as
his
inclination
dictated
regardless
of
consequences
he
at
once
determined
to
enter
the
lodges
and
attack
the
enemy
should
any
be
there
and
the
other
trapper
was
fain
to
join
him
in
the
enterprise
the
lodges
proved
empty
but
the
fires
were
still
burning
and
meat
cooking
upon
them
to
which
the
hungry
hunters
did
ample
justice
besides
helping
themselves
to
whatever
goods
and
chattels
in
the
shape
of
leather
and
moccasins
took
their
fancy
gathering
their
spoil
into
a
bundle
they
sought
their
horses
which
they
had
left
tied
under
cover
of
the
timber
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
and
mounting
took
the
back
trail
to
pick
up
their
traps
and
remove
from
so
dangerous
a
neighbourhood
they
were
approaching
the
spot
where
the
first
trap
was
set
a
thick
growth
of
ash
and
concealing
the
stream
when
markhead
who
was
riding
ahead
observed
the
bushes
agitated
as
if
some
animal
was
making
its
way
through
them
he
instantly
stopped
his
horse
and
his
companion
rode
to
his
side
to
inquire
the
cause
of
this
abrupt
halt
they
were
within
a
few
yards
of
the
belt
of
shrubs
which
skirted
the
stream
and
before
markhead
had
time
to
reply
a
dozen
swarthy
heads
and
shoulders
suddenly
protruded
from
the
leafy
screen
and
as
many
and
arrows
were
pointing
at
their
breasts
before
the
trappers
had
time
to
turn
their
horses
and
fly
a
cloud
of
smoke
burst
from
the
thicket
almost
in
their
faces
batiste
pierced
with
several
balls
fell
dead
and
markhead
felt
himself
severely
wounded
however
he
struck
the
spurs
into
his
horse
and
as
some
blackfeet
jumped
with
loud
cries
from
their
cover
he
discharged
his
rifle
amongst
them
and
galloped
off
a
volley
of
balls
and
arrows
whistling
after
him
he
drew
no
bit
until
he
reined
up
at
the
where
he
found
bill
quietly
dressing
a
that
worthy
looked
up
from
his
work
and
seeing
markhead
face
streaming
with
blood
and
the
very
unequivocal
evidence
of
an
indian
rencontre
in
the
shape
of
an
arrow
sticking
in
his
back
he
asked
do
feel
bad
now
boy
whar
away
you
see
them
darned
blackfoot
well
pull
this
arrow
out
of
my
back
and
may
be
i
feel
like
telling
answered
markhead
do
hyar
now
hold
on
till
i
grained
this
cussed
skin
will
did
ever
see
sich
a
darned
pelt
now
it
wo
take
the
smoke
any
how
i
fix
and
markhead
was
fain
to
wait
the
leisure
of
the
imperturbable
old
trapper
before
he
was
eased
of
his
annoying
companion
old
bill
expressed
no
surprise
or
grief
when
informed
of
the
fate
of
poor
batiste
he
said
it
was
just
like
greenhorns
runnin
into
them
cussed
blackfoot
and
observed
that
the
defunct
trapper
being
only
a
was
no
account
presently
killbuck
and
la
bonté
galloped
into
camp
with
another
alarm
of
indians
they
had
also
been
attacked
suddenly
by
a
band
of
blackfeet
but
being
in
a
more
open
country
had
got
clear
off
after
killing
two
of
their
assailants
whose
scalps
hung
at
the
horns
of
their
saddles
they
had
been
in
a
different
direction
to
that
in
which
markhead
and
his
companion
had
proceeded
and
from
the
signs
they
had
observed
expressed
their
belief
that
the
country
was
alive
with
indians
neither
of
these
men
had
been
wounded
presently
the
two
canadians
made
their
appearance
on
the
bluff
galloping
with
might
and
main
to
camp
and
shouting
indians
indians
as
they
came
all
being
assembled
and
a
council
held
it
was
determined
to
abandon
the
camp
and
neighbourhood
immediately
old
bill
was
already
packing
his
animals
and
as
he
pounded
the
saddle
down
on
the
withers
of
his
old
rosinante
he
muttered
do
hyar
now
this
coon
câche
so
mounting
his
horse
and
leading
his
pack
mule
by
a
lariat
he
bent
over
his
dug
his
ponderous
rowels
into
the
lank
sides
of
his
beast
and
without
a
word
struck
up
the
bluff
and
disappeared
the
others
hastily
gathering
up
their
packs
and
most
of
them
having
lost
their
traps
quickly
followed
his
example
and
put
on
cresting
the
high
ground
which
rose
from
the
creek
they
observed
thin
columns
of
smoke
mounting
into
the
air
from
many
different
points
the
meaning
of
which
they
were
at
no
loss
to
guess
however
they
were
careful
not
to
show
themselves
on
elevated
ground
keeping
as
much
as
possible
under
the
banks
of
the
creek
when
such
a
course
was
practicable
but
the
bluffs
sometimes
rising
precipitously
from
the
water
they
were
more
than
once
compelled
to
ascend
the
banks
and
continue
their
course
along
the
uplands
whence
they
might
easily
be
discovered
by
the
indians
it
was
nearly
sundown
when
they
left
their
camp
but
they
proceeded
during
the
greater
part
of
the
night
at
as
rapid
a
rate
as
possible
their
progress
however
being
greatly
retarded
as
they
advanced
into
the
mountain
their
route
lying
up
stream
towards
morning
they
halted
for
a
brief
space
but
started
again
as
soon
as
daylight
permitted
them
to
see
their
way
over
the
broken
ground
the
creek
now
forced
its
way
through
a
narrow
cañon
the
banks
being
thickly
clothed
with
a
shrubbery
of
cottonwood
and
the
mountain
rose
on
each
side
but
not
abruptly
being
here
and
there
broken
into
plateaus
and
shelving
prairies
in
a
very
thick
bottom
sprinkled
with
coarse
grass
they
halted
about
noon
and
removed
the
saddles
and
packs
from
their
wearied
animals
picketing
them
in
the
best
spots
of
grass
la
bonté
and
killbuck
after
securing
their
animals
left
the
camp
to
hunt
for
they
had
no
provisions
of
any
kind
and
a
short
distance
beyond
it
the
former
came
suddenly
upon
a
recent
moccasin
track
in
the
timber
after
examining
it
for
a
moment
he
raised
his
head
with
a
broad
grin
and
turning
to
his
companion
pointed
into
the
cover
where
in
the
thickest
part
they
discerned
the
figure
of
old
bill
horse
browsing
upon
the
cherry
bushes
pushing
through
the
thicket
in
search
of
the
brute
master
la
bonté
suddenly
stopped
short
as
the
muzzle
of
a
gaped
before
his
eyes
at
the
distance
of
a
few
inches
whilst
the
thin
voice
of
bill
do
hyar
now
i
was
nigh
giving
i
now
if
i
did
think
was
blackfoot
i
dogged
and
not
a
little
indignant
was
the
old
fellow
that
his
câche
had
been
so
easily
though
accidentally
discovered
however
he
presently
made
his
appearance
in
camp
leading
his
animals
and
once
more
joined
his
late
companions
not
deigning
to
give
any
explanation
as
to
why
or
wherefore
he
had
deserted
them
the
day
before
merely
muttering
do
hyar
now
thar
trouble
the
two
hunters
returned
after
sundown
with
a
deer
and
after
eating
the
better
part
of
the
meat
and
setting
a
guard
the
party
were
glad
to
roll
in
their
blankets
and
enjoy
the
rest
they
so
much
needed
they
were
undisturbed
during
the
night
but
at
dawn
of
day
the
sleepers
were
roused
by
a
hundred
fierce
yells
from
the
mountains
enclosing
the
creek
on
which
they
had
encamped
the
yells
were
instantly
followed
by
a
ringing
volley
the
bullets
thudding
into
the
trees
and
cutting
the
branches
near
them
but
without
causing
any
mischief
old
bill
rose
from
his
blanket
and
shook
himself
and
exclaimed
wagh
as
at
that
moment
a
ball
plumped
into
the
fire
over
which
he
was
standing
and
knocked
the
ashes
about
in
a
cloud
all
the
mountaineers
seized
their
rifles
and
sprang
to
cover
but
as
yet
it
was
not
sufficiently
light
to
show
them
their
enemy
the
bright
flashes
from
the
guns
alone
indicating
their
position
as
morning
dawned
however
they
saw
that
both
sides
of
the
cañon
were
occupied
by
the
indians
and
from
the
firing
judged
there
must
be
at
least
a
hundred
warriors
engaged
in
the
attack
not
a
shot
had
yet
been
fired
by
the
trappers
but
as
the
light
increased
they
eagerly
watched
for
an
indian
to
expose
himself
and
offer
a
mark
to
their
trusty
rifles
la
bonté
killbuck
and
old
bill
lay
a
few
yards
distant
from
each
other
flat
on
their
faces
near
the
edge
of
the
thicket
their
rifles
raised
before
them
and
the
barrels
resting
in
the
forks
of
convenient
bushes
from
their
place
of
concealment
to
the
position
of
the
however
were
scattered
here
and
there
wherever
a
rock
afforded
them
a
distance
of
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
or
within
fair
the
trappers
were
obliged
to
divide
their
force
since
both
sides
of
the
creek
were
occupied
but
such
was
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
the
excellent
cover
afforded
by
the
rocks
and
boulders
and
clumps
of
dwarf
pine
and
hemlock
that
not
a
of
an
indian
body
had
yet
been
seen
nearly
opposite
la
bonté
a
shelving
glade
in
the
mountain
side
ended
in
an
abrupt
precipice
and
at
the
very
edge
and
almost
toppling
over
it
were
several
boulders
just
of
sufficient
size
to
afford
cover
to
a
man
body
as
this
bluff
overlooked
the
trappers
position
it
was
occupied
by
the
indians
and
every
rock
covered
an
assailant
at
one
point
just
over
where
la
bonté
and
killbuck
were
lying
two
boulders
lay
together
with
just
sufficient
interval
to
admit
a
between
them
and
from
this
an
indian
kept
up
a
most
annoying
fire
all
his
shots
fell
in
dangerous
propinquity
to
one
or
other
of
the
trappers
and
already
killbuck
had
been
grazed
by
one
better
directed
than
the
others
la
bonté
watched
for
some
time
in
vain
for
a
chance
to
answer
this
persevering
marksman
and
at
length
an
opportunity
offered
by
which
he
was
not
long
in
profiting
the
indian
as
the
light
increased
was
better
able
to
discern
his
mark
and
fired
and
yelled
every
time
he
did
so
with
redoubled
vigour
in
his
eagerness
and
probably
whilst
in
the
act
of
taking
aim
he
leaned
too
heavily
against
the
rock
which
covered
him
and
detaching
it
from
its
position
down
it
rolled
into
the
cañon
exposing
his
body
by
its
fall
at
the
same
instant
a
wreath
of
smoke
puffed
from
the
bushes
which
concealed
the
trappers
and
the
crack
of
la
bonté
rifle
spoke
the
first
word
of
reply
to
the
indian
challenge
a
few
feet
behind
the
rock
fell
the
dead
body
of
the
indian
rolling
down
the
steep
sides
of
the
cañon
and
only
stopped
by
a
bush
at
the
very
bottom
within
a
few
yards
of
the
spot
where
markhead
lay
concealed
in
some
high
grass
that
daring
fellow
instantly
jumped
from
his
cover
and
drawing
his
knife
rushed
to
the
body
and
in
another
moment
held
aloft
the
indian
scalp
giving
at
the
same
time
a
triumphant
whoop
a
score
of
rifles
were
levelled
and
discharged
at
the
intrepid
mountaineer
but
in
the
act
many
indians
incautiously
exposed
themselves
every
rifle
in
the
timber
cracked
simultaneously
and
for
each
report
an
indian
bit
the
dust
now
however
they
changed
their
tactics
finding
they
were
unable
to
drive
the
trappers
from
their
position
they
retired
from
the
mountain
and
the
firing
suddenly
ceased
in
their
retreat
they
were
forced
to
expose
themselves
and
again
the
whites
dealt
destruction
amongst
them
as
the
indians
retired
yelling
loudly
the
hunters
thought
they
had
given
up
the
contest
but
presently
a
cloud
of
smoke
rising
from
the
bottom
immediately
below
them
at
once
discovered
the
nature
of
their
plans
a
brisk
wind
was
blowing
up
the
cañon
and
favoured
by
it
they
fired
the
brush
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
knowing
that
before
this
the
hunters
must
speedily
retreat
against
such
a
result
but
for
the
gale

like

huge
volumes

in

very
few
minutes
the

were
hastily
mounting
their
animals
driving
the
packed
ones
before
them
the
dense
clouds
of
smoke
concealed
every
thing
from

to
avoid

they
broke
from

and
galloped
up
the
sides
of
the
cañon
on
to
the
more
level
plateau
as
they
attained
this
a
band
of
mounted
indians
charged

waving
a
red
blanket
dashed
through
the
cavallada
and
was
instantly
followed
by
all
the
loose
animals
of
the
trappers
the
rest
of
the
indians
pursuing
with
loud
shouts
so
sudden
was
the
charge
that
the
whites
had
not
power
to
prevent

as

led
his
pack
mules
by

but
the

mad
with
terror
at
the
shouts
of

indians
broke
from
him
nearly
pulling
him
out
of
his
seat
at
the

time
to
cover
the
retreat
of
the
others
with
their
prey
a
band
of
mounted
indians
now
appeared
threatening
an

not
a

too
soon
for
overwhelming
numbers
were
charging
upon
them
and
the
mountain
resounded
with
savage
yells
la

and
killbuck
stuck
together
they
saw
old
bill
bending
over
his
saddle
dive
right
into
the
cloud
of
smoke
and
apparently
make
for
the
creek
other
companions
scattering
each
on
his
own
hook
and
saw
no
more
of
them
for
many
a
month

thus
was
one
of
the
most
daring
and
successful
bands
broken
up
that
ever
trapped

the
mountains
of

west
it
is
painful
to
follow
the
steps
of
the
poor
fellows
who
thus
despoiled
of
the
produce
of
their
hunt
saw
all
their
wealth
torn
from

swoop
the

killed
upon

night
succeeding

of
the
attack
worn
with
fatigue
hungry
and
cold
they
had
built
a
fire
in
what
they
thought
was
a
secure
retreat
and
rolled
in
their
blankets

soon
buried
in
a
sleep
from
which
they
never
awoke
an

tracked
them

watched
their

signalising
himself
thus
early
he
awaited
his
opportunity
and

them
both
with

and
returned
in
triumph
to
his
people
with
their
horses
and

killbuck
sought
a
passage
in
the

by

to

over

and
there
fall
in

of

became
involved
in

in
a
part
where
was
no
game
of
any
description

no
pasture
for
their
miserable
animals
one
of
these
they
killed
for
food
the
other
a
bag
of
bones
died
from
sheer
starvation
they
had
very
little
ammunition
their
moccasins
were
worn
out
and
they
were
unable
to
procure
skins
to
supply
themselves
with
fresh
ones

was
fast
approaching
the
snow
already
covered
the

of

poured
incessantly
through

benumbing
their
exhausted
limbs
hardly
protected
by

and
ragged
covering

to

was
taken
ill
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
groin
by
a
bullet
some
time
before
and
the
ball
still
remained
the
wound
aggravated
by
walking
and
the
excessive
cold
assumed
an
ugly
appearance
and
soon
rendered
him
incapable
of
sustained
exertion
all

even
being
attended
with
intolerable
pain

made
a
shanty
for
his
suffering
companion
and
spread
a
soft
bed
of
pine
branches
for
him
by
the
side
of
a
small
creek
at
the
point
where
it
came
out
of
the
mountain
and
followed
its
course
through
a
little
prairie
they
had
been
three
days
without
other
food
than
a
piece
of
parflêche
which
had
formed
the
back
of
la

and
which
after
soaking
in
the
creek
they
eagerly
devoured
killbuck
was
unable
to
move
and
sinking
fast
from
exhaustion
his
companion
had
hunted
from
morning
till
night
as
well
as
his
failing
strength
would
allow
him
but
had
not
seen
the
traces
of
any
kind
of
game
with
the
exception
of
some
old
buffalo
tracks
made
apparently
months
before
by
a
band
of
bulls
crossing
the
mountain

morning
of
the
fourth
day

as
usual
rose
at
daybreak
from
his
blanket
and
was
proceeding
to
collect
wood
for
the
fire
during
his
absence
while
hunting
when
killbuck
called
to
him
and
in
an
almost
inarticulate
voice
desired
him
to
seat
himself
by
his
side
boy
he
said
this
old
hos
feels
like
goin
under
and
that
afore
long
you
stout
yet
and
if
thar
was
meat
handy
you
come
round
slick
now
boy
i
be
under
as
i
said
afore
many
hours
and
if
you
do
raise
meat
you
be
in
the
same
fix
i
never
eat
dead
meat
myself
and
would
ask
no
one
to
do
it
neither
but
meat
fair
killed
is
meat
any
way
so
boy
put
your
knife
in
this
old
niggur
lights
and
help
yourself
it
bull
i
know
but
maybe
it
do

keep
life

thar
meat
yet

maybe
my
old

has

you
a
good

answered

but
this
child
turned
niggur
killbuck
then
begged
his
companion
to
leave
him
to
his
fate
and
strive
himself
to
reach
game
but
this
alternative
la
bonté
likewise
generously
refused
and
faintly
endeavouring
to
cheer
the
sick
man
left
him
once
again
to
look
for
game
he
was
so
weak
that
he
felt
difficulty
in
supporting
himself
and
knowing
how
futile
would
be
his
attempts
to
hunt
he
sallied
from
the
camp
convinced
that
a
few
hours
more
would
see
the
last
of
him
he
had
scarcely
raised
his
eyes
when
hardly
crediting
his
senses
he
saw
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
him
an
old
bull
worn
with
age
lying
on
the
prairie
two
wolves
were
seated
on
their
haunches
before
him
their
tongues
lolling
from
their
mouths
whilst
the
buffalo
was
impotently
rolling
his
ponderous
head
from
side
to
side
his
eyes
glaring
fiercely
at
his
tormentors
and
flakes
of
foam
mixed
with
blood
dropping
from
his
mouth
over
his
long
shaggy
beard

transfixed
he
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
lest
the
animal
should
be
alarmed
and
escape
weak
as
it
was
he
could
hardly
have
followed
it
and
knowing
that
his
own
and
companion
life
hung
upon
the
success
of
his
shot
he
scarcely
had
strength
to
raise
his
rifle
by
dint
of
extraordinary
exertions
and
precautions
which
were
totally
unnecessary
for

poor
old

not
a

approached
within

upon
the
ground

took
a
long
steady
aim
and
fired

raised
its
matted
head
tossed
it
wildly
for
an
instant
and
stretching
out
its
limbs
convulsively
turned
over
on
its
side
and
was

the
shot
and
crawling
from
under
the
little
shanty
which
covered
his
bed

to
his
astonishment

in
the
act
of
butchering
a
buffalo
within
two
hundred
yards
of
camp
hurraw
for
you
he
faintly
exclaimed
and
exhausted
by
the
exertion
he
had
used
and
perhaps
by
the
excitement
of
an
anticipated
feast
fell
back
and
fainted
however
the
killing
was
the
easiest
matter
for
when
the
huge
carcass
lay
dead
upon
the
ground
our
hunter
had
hardly
strength
to
drive
the
blade
of
his
knife
through
the
tough
hide
of
the
old

having
cut
off
as
much
of
the
meat
as

could
carry

the
while
sundry
portions
of
the
liver
which
he
dipped
in
the
by
way

cast
a
wistful
look
upon
the
wolves
who
now
loped
round
and
round
licking
their
chops
only
waiting
until
his
back
was

a

him
then
taking

he
raised
him
tenderly
into

invited
in
kindly
accents
the

to
feed

at
the

a
tolerable

it
was
in
all
conscience
the
labour
of
chewing
a
mouthful
of
the
tender
loin

equal
to
a
hard
day
hunt
but
to
them
poor
starved
fellows
it
appeared
the
richest
of
meat
they
still
preserved
a
small
tin
pot
and
in
this
by
stress
of
eternal
boiling
la

contrived
to
make
some
strong
soup
which
soon
restored
his
sick
companion
to
marching
order
for
himself
as
soon
as
a
good
meal
had
filled
him
he
was
strong
as
ever
and
employed
himself
in
drying
the
remainder
of
the
meat
for
future
use
even
the
wolf
bony
as
he
was
was
converted
into
meat

so

to
remain
in
his

position
until
spring
as
he
now
found
that
buffalo
frequently
visited
the
valley
as
it
was
more
bare
of
snow
than
the
lowlands
and
afforded
them
better
pasture
and
one
morning
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
a
band
of
seventeen
bulls
within
long
of
the
camp
out
of
which
four
of
the
fattest
were
soon
laid
low
by
his
rifle
they
still
had
hard
times
before
them
for
towards
spring
the
buffalo
again
disappeared
the
greater
part
of
their
meat
had
been
spoiled
owing
to
there
not
being
sufficient
sun
to
dry
it
thoroughly
and
when
they
resumed
their
journey
they
had
nothing
to
carry
with
them
and
had
a
desert
before
them

of
any

pointed
stood
up
and
hitching
round
his
pouch
and
drew
the
stopper
from
the
latter
with
his
teeth
and
placing
the
mouth
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
turned
the
horn
up
and
shook
it
not
a
grain
he
not
a
grain
old
wagh
exclaimed
the
other
we
have
to
eat
afore
long
and
rising
walked
into
the
prairie
he
had
hardly
stepped
two
paces
when
passing
close
to
a
sage
bush
a
rattlesnake
whizzed
a
note
of
warning
with
its
tail
killbuck
grinned
and
taking
the
from
his
tapped
the
snake
on
the
head
and
taking
it
by
the
tail
threw
it
to
la
bonté
saying
hyar
meat
any
the
old
fellow
followed
up
his
success
by
slaying
more
and
brought
them
in
skewered
through
the
head
on
his
a
fire
was
soon
kindled
and
the
snakes
roasting
before
it
when
la
bonté
who
sat
looking
at
the
buffalo
which
fed
close
to
the
rock
suddenly
saw
them
raise
their
heads
snuff
the
air
and
scamper
towards
him
a
few
minutes
afterwards
a
huge
shapeless
body
loomed
in
the
refracted
air
approaching
the
spot
where
the
buffalo
had
been
grazing
the
hunters
looked
at
it
and
then
at
each
other
and
ejaculated
wagh
presently
a
long
white
mass
showed
more
distinctly
followed
by
another
and
before
each
was
a
string
of
animals
waggons
by
hos
and
beaver
hurrah
for
conostoga
exclaimed
the
trappers
in
a
breath
as
they
now
observed
two
waggons
drawn
by
several
pairs
of
mules
approaching
the
very
spot
where
they
sat
several
mounted
men
were
riding
about
the
waggons
and
two
on
horseback
in
advance
of
all
were
approaching
the
rock
when
they
observed
the
smoke
curling
from
the
hunters
fire
they
halted
at
sight
of
this
and
one
of
the
two
drawing
a
long
instrument
from
a
case
which
killbuck
voted
a
rifle
directed
it
towards
them
for
a
moment
and
then
lowering
it
again
moved
forward
as
they
drew
near
the
two
poor
trappers
although
with
joy
still
retained
their
seats
with
indian
gravity
and
immobility
of
feature
turning
now
and
then
the
crackling
snakes
which
lay
on
the
embers
of
the
fire
the
two
strangers
approached
one
a
man
of
some
fifty
years
of
age
of
middle
height
and
stoutly
built
was
clad
in
a
white
of
cut
unknown
in
mountain
tailoring
and
a
pair
of
trousers
of
the
material
called
shepherd
plaid
a
panama
shaded
his
face
which
was
ruddy
with
health
and
exercise
a
belt
round
the
waist
supported
a
handsome
and
a
was
across
his
shoulder
his
companion
was
likewise
dressed
in
a
light
of
many
pockets
and
dandy
cut
rode
on
an
english
saddle
and
in
and
was
armed
with
a
superb
double
rifle
glossy
from
the
case
and
bearing
few
marks
of
use
or
service
he
was
a
tall
fellow
of
thirty
with
light
hair
and
complexion
a
scrupulous
beard
and
mustache
a
hat
with
a
short
pipe
stuck
in
the
band
not
very
black
with
smoke
an
elaborate
over
his
shoulder
with
a
cairngorm
in
the
butt
as
large
as
a
plate
a
blue
handkerchief
tied
round
his
throat
in
a
sailor
knot
and
the
collar
of
his
shirt
turned
carefully
over
it
he
had
moreover
a
tolerable
idea
of
his
very
correct
appearance
and
wore
woodstock
gloves
the
trappers
looked
at
them
from
head
to
foot
and
the
more
they
looked
the
less
could
they
make
them
out
exclaimed
la
bonté
emphatically
this
beats
grainin
slick
broke
from
killbuck
as
the
strangers
reined
up
at
the
fire
the
younger
dismounting
and
staring
with
wonder
at
the
trappers
well
my
men
how
are
you
he
rattled
out
any
game
here
by
jove
he
suddenly
exclaimed
seizing
his
rifle
as
at
that
moment
a
large
buzzard
the
most
unclean
of
birds
flew
into
the
topmost
branch
of
a
cottonwood
and
sat
a
tempting
shot
by
jove
there
a
chance
cried
the
mighty
hunter
and
bending
low
started
off
to
approach
the
unwary
bird
in
the
most
approved
fashion
of
northern
the
buzzard
sat
quietly
and
now
and
then
stretched
its
neck
to
gaze
upon
the
advancing
sportsman
who
on
such
occasions
threw
himself
flat
on
the
ground
and
remained
motionless
in
dread
of
alarming
the
bird
it
was
worth
while
to
look
at
the
countenance
of
old
killbuck
as
he
watched
the
antics
of
the
bourgeois
hunter
he
thought
at
first
that
the
dandy
rifleman
had
really
discovered
game
in
the
bottom
and
was
nothing
loth
that
there
was
a
chance
of
his
seeing
meat
but
when
he
understood
the
object
of
such
manœuvres
and
saw
the
quarry
the
hunter
was
so
carefully
approaching
his
mouth
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
and
turning
to
la
bonté
he
said
wagh
is
nothing
doubting
however
the
stranger
approached
the
tree
on
which
the
bird
was
sitting
and
getting
well
under
it
raised
his
rifle
and
fired
down
tumbled
the
bird
and
the
successful
hunter
with
a
loud
shout
rushed
frantically
towards
it
and
bore
it
in
triumph
to
the
camp
earning
the
most
sovereign
contempt
from
the
two
trappers
by
the
achievement
the
other
stranger
was
a
quieter
character
he
too
smiled
as
he
witnessed
the
exultation
of
his
younger
companion
whose
horse
by
the
way
was
scampering
about
the
plain
and
spoke
kindly
to
the
mountaineers
whose
appearance
was
clear
evidence
of
the
sufferings
they
had
endured
the
snakes
by
this
time
were
cooked
and
the
trappers
gave
their
new
acquaintances
the
invitation
to
sit
and
when
the
latter
however
understood
what
the
viands
were
their
looks
expressed
the
horror
and
disgust
they
felt
good
god
exclaimed
the
elder
you
surely
can
not
eat
such
disgusting
food
this
niggur
does
savy
what
disgustin
is
gruffly
answered
killbuck
but
them
as
carries
empty
paunch
three
days
an
more
is
glad
to
get
i
what
you
no
ammunition
then
we
wait
till
the
waggons
come
up
and
throw
away
that
abominable
stuff
and
you
shall
have
something
better
i
promise
said
the
elder
of
the
strangers
yes
continued
the
younger
some
hot
preserved
soup
and
a
glass
of
porter
will
do
you
the
trappers
looked
at
the
speaker
who
was
talking
greek
to
them
they
thought
the
bourgeois
were
making
fun
and
did
not
half
like
it
so
answered
simply
wagh
full
of
and
two
large
waggons
presently
came
up
escorted
by
some
eight
or
ten
stout
missourians
sublette
was
amongst
the
number
well
known
as
a
mountain
trader
and
under
whose
guidance
the
present
party
which
formed
a
pleasure
expedition
at
the
expense
of
a
scotch
sportsman
was
leisurely
making
its
way
across
the
mountains
to
the
columbia
as
several
mountaineers
were
in
company
killbuck
and
la
bonté
recognised
more
than
one
friend
and
the
former
and
sublette
were
old
compañeros
as
soon
as
the
animals
were
unhitched
and
camp
formed
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
a
black
cook
set
about
preparing
a
meal
our
two
trapping
friends
looked
on
with
astonishment
as
the
sable
functionary
drew
from
the
waggon
the
different
articles
he
required
to
furnish
forth
a
feed
hams
tongues
tins
of
preserved
meats
bottles
of
pickles
of
porter
brandy
coffee
sugar
flour
were
tumbled
promiscuously
on
the
prairie
whilst
pots
and
pans
knives
forks
spoons
plates
displayed
their
unfamiliar
faces
to
the
mountaineers
and
porter
did
not
now
appear
such
utopian
articles
as
they
had
first
imagined
but
no
one
but
those
who
have
fared
for
years
on
simple
meat
and
water
can
understand
the
relish
with
which
they
accepted
the
invitation
of
the
capen
as
they
called
the
scotchman
to
take
a
horn
of
killbuck
and
la
bonté
sat
in
the
same
position
as
when
we
first
surprised
them
asleep
under
the
shadow
of
independence
rock
regarding
the
profuse
display
of
comestibles
with
eyes
and
childishly
helpless
from
the
novelty
of
the
scene
each
took
the
proffered
cup
filled
to
the
brim
with
excellent
no
they
once
at
the
surface
and
with
the
usual
mountain
pledge
of
here
luck
tossed
off
the
grateful
liquour
at
a
breath
this
prepared
them
in
some
measure
for
what
was
yet
in
store
for
them
the
scotchman
bestirred
the
cook
in
his
work
and
soon
sundry
steaming
pots
were
lifted
from
the
fire
and
the
skillets
emptied
of
their
contents
of
the
former
poured
in
large
flat
pans
while
panikins
were
filled
with
smoking
coffee
the
two
trappers
needed
no
second
invitation
but
seizing
each
a
panful
of
steaming
stew
drew
the
from
their
belts
and
fell
to
hospitable
scotchman
plying
them
with
more
and
more
and
administering
corrective
noggins
of
brandy
the
while
until
at
last
they
were
fain
to
cry
enough
wiped
their
knives
on
the
grass
and
placed
them
in
their
sign
that
human
nature
could
no
more
how
can
pen
describe
the
luxury
of
the
smoke
that
followed
to
lips
which
had
not
kissed
pipe
for
many
months
and
how
the
fragrant
from
old
virginia
was
relishingly
puffed
but
the
scotchman
bounty
did
not
stop
here
he
soon
elicited
from
the
lips
of
the
hunters
the
narrative
of
their
losses
and
privations
and
learned
that
they
now
without
ammunition
and
scarcely
clothed
were
on
their
way
to
platte
fort
to
hire
themselves
to
the
indian
traders
in
order
to
earn
another
outfit
wherewith
once
more
to
betake
themselves
to
their
perilous
employment
of
trapping
what
was
their
astonishment
to
see
their
entertainer
presently
lay
out
upon
the
ground
two
piles
of
goods
each
consisting
of
a
mackinaw
two
tin
canisters
of
powder
with
corresponding
lead
and
flints
a
pair
of
moccasins
a
shirt
and
sufficient
buckskin
to
make
a
pair
of
pantaloons
and
how
much
the
more
was
the
wonder
increased
when
two
excellent
indian
horses
were
presently
lassoed
from
the
cavallada
and
with
mountain
saddle
bridle
and
lariats
complete
together
with
the
two
piles
of
goods
described
presented
to
them
on
the
prairie
or
by
the
stranger
who
would
not
even
listen
to
thanks
for
the
most
timely
and
invaluable
present
once
more
equipped
our
two
hunters
filled
with
good
brandy
and
fat
buffalo
meat
again
wended
on
their
way
their
late
entertainers
continuing
their
pleasure
trip
across
the
gap
of
the
south
pass
intending
to
visit
the
great
salt
lake
or
timponogos
of
the
west
the
former
were
bound
for
the
north
fork
of
the
platte
with
the
intention
of
joining
one
of
the
numerous
trapping
parties
which
rendezvous
at
the
american
fur
company
post
on
that
branch
of
the
river
on
a
fork
of
sweet
water
however
not
two
days
after
the
meeting
with
the
scotchman
waggons
they
encountered
a
band
of
a
dozen
mountaineers
mounted
on
fine
horses
and
well
armed
and
equipped
travelling
along
without
the
usual
accompaniment
of
a
mulada
of
two
or
three
mules
alone
being
packed
with
meat
and
spare
ammunition
the
band
was
proceeding
at
a
smart
rate
the
horses
moving
with
the
gait
peculiar
to
american
animals
known
as
or
in
indian
of
the
mountaineers
with
a
long
heavy
rifle
resting
across
the
horn
of
his
saddle
amongst
them
our
two
friends
recognised
markhead
who
had
been
of
the
party
dispersed
months
before
by
the
blackfeet
on
one
of
the
head
streams
of
the
yellow
stone
which
event
had
been
the
origin
of
the
dire
sufferings
of
killbuck
and
la
bonté
markhead
after
running
the
gauntlet
of
numerous
indians
through
the
midst
of
whose
country
he
passed
with
his
usual
temerity
and
utter
disregard
to
danger
suffering
hunger
thirst
and
experiences
of
mountain
with
balls
but
with
three
scalps
hanging
from
his
belt
made
his
way
to
a
rendezvous
on
bear
river
whence
he
struck
out
for
the
platte
in
early
spring
in
time
to
join
the
band
he
now
accompanied
who
were
on
a
expedition
to
the
missions
of
upper
california
little
persuasion
did
either
killbuck
or
la
bonté
require
to
join
the
sturdy
freebooters
in
five
minutes
they
had
gone
and
at
sundown
were
camping
on
the
bottom
of
little
sandy
feasting
once
more
on
delicate
and
tender
loin
for
california

in
the
hands
of

men

strong
horses
of
true

and
cool
heads
with
fourteen
pairs
of
keen
eyes
in

crafty
as
an
indian
directing

as

and

a

by
hostile

and

the
arrows
of
wily
hordes
of

dangers
past
the
invasion

which
contained

times

of
armed
and
bitter
enemies
sudden
swoop
upon
their
countless
herds
of
mules
and
horses
the
fierce
attack
and
bloody
slaughter
were
the
consequences
of
the
expedition
these
bold
mountaineers
were
now
engaged
in
fourteen
lives
of

enemies
who
would
be
rash
enough
to
stay
them
were
any
day
you
will
carried
in
the

of
these
stout
fellows
who
in
all
the
proud
consciousness
of
their
physical
qualities
neither
thought
nor
cared
to
think
of
future
perils
and
rode
merrily
on
their
way
rejoicing
in
the
dangers
they
must
necessarily
meet
never
a
more
daring
band
crossed
the
mountains
a
more
than
ordinary
want
of
caution
characterised
their
march
and
dangers
were
recklessly
and
needlessly
invited
which
even
the
older
and
more
mountaineers
seemed
not
to
care
to
avoid
they
had
each
and
all
many
a
debt
to
pay
the
marauding
indians
grudges
for
many
privations
for
wounds
and
loss
of
comrades
rankled
in
their
breasts
and
not
one
but
had
suffered
more
or
less
in
property
and
person
at
the
hands
of
the
savages
within
a
few
short
months
threats
of
vengeance
on
every
redskin
they
met
were
loud
and
deep
and
the
wild
round
their
nightly
and
grotesque
borrowed
from
the
indians
proved
to
the
initiated
that
they
were
one
and
all
for
soon
after
killbuck
and
la
bonté
joined
them
they
one
day
suddenly
surprised
a
band
of
twenty
sioux
scattered
on
a
small
prairie
and
butchering
some
buffalo
they
had
just
killed
before
they
could
escape
the
whites
were
upon
them
with
loud
shouts
and
in
three
minutes
the
scalps
of
eleven
were
dangling
from
their
struggling
up
mountains
slipping
down
precipices
dashing
over
prairies
which
resounded
with
their
indian
songs
charging
the
indians
wherever
they
met
them
and
without
regard
to
their
numbers
frightening
with
their
lusty
the
miserable
diggers
who
were
not
unfrequently
surprised
while
gathering
roots
in
the
mountain
plains
and
who
scrambling
up
the
rocks
and
concealing
themselves
like
sage
rabbits
in
holes
and
corners
peered
chattering
with
fear
as
the
wild
and
noisy
troop
rode
by
drawing
rein
they
passed
rapidly
the
heads
of
green
and
grand
rivers
through
a
country
abounding
in
game
and
in
excellent
pasture
encountering
in
the
upland
valleys
through
which
meandered
the
creeks
on
which
they
made
their
daily
camps
many
a
band
of
yutas
through
whom
they
dashed
at
random
caring
not
whether
they
were
friends
or
foes
passing
many
other
heads
of
streams
they
struck
at
last
the
edge
of
the
desert
lying
along
the
base
of
the
great
salt
lake
and
which
extends
in
almost
unbroken
sterility
to
the
foot
of
the
range
of
the
sierra
mountain
chain
capped
with
perpetual
snow
that
bounds
the
northern
extremity
of
a
singular
tract
of
country
walled
by
mountains
and
utterly
desert
whose
salt
lagoons
and
lakes
although
fed
by
many
streams
find
no
outlet
to
the
ocean
but
are
absorbed
in
the
spongy
soil
or
thirsty
sand
which
characterise
the
different
portions
of
this
deserted
tract
in
the
grand
basin
it
is
reported
neither
human
nor
animal
life
can
be
supported
no
oases
cheer
the
wanderer
in
the
unbroken
solitude
of
the
vast
wilderness
more
than
once
the
lone
trapper
has
penetrated
with
hardy
enterprise
into
the
salt
plains
of
the
basin
but
no
signs
of

which

the
visible
change
in

scenery
had
also
a
sensible
effect
on
the
spirits
of
the
mountaineers
they
travelled
on
in
silence
through
the
deserted
plains
the
of
their
indian
chants
was
no
longer
heard
enlivening
the
line
of

more
than
once
a
digger
of
the
piyutah
tribe
took
himself
and
hair
in
safety
from
their
path
and
almost
unnoticed
but
as
they
advanced
they
became
more
cautious
in
their
movements
and
testified
by
the
vigilant
watch
they
kept
that
they
anticipated
hostile
attacks
even
in
these
arid
wastes
they
had
passed
without
molestation
through
the
country
infested
by
the
bolder
indians
the
mountain
yutas
not
relishing
the
appearance
of
the
hunters
had
left
them
unmolested
but
they
were
now
entering
a
country
inhabited
by
the
most
degraded
and
abject
of
the
western
tribes
who
nevertheless
ever
suffering
from
the
extremities
of
hunger
have
their
brutish
wits
sharpened
by
the
necessity
of
procuring
food
and
rarely
fail
to
levy
a
contribution
of
rations
of
horse
or
mule
flesh
on
the
passenger
in
their
inhospitable
country
the
brutish
cunning
and
animal
instinct
of
these
wretches
is
such
that
although
arrant
cowards
their
attacks
are
more
feared
than
those
of
bolder
indians
these
the
yamparicas
or
nevertheless
the
degenerate
descendants
of
those
tribes
which
once
overran
that
portion
of
the
continent
of
north
america
now
comprehended
within
the
boundaries
of
mexico
and
who
have
left
such
startling
evidences
in
their
track
of
a
comparatively
superior
state
of
civilisation
they
now
form
an
outcast
tribe
of
the
great
nation
of
the
apache
which
extends
under
various
names
from
the
great
salt
lake
along
the
on
each
side
the
sierra
madre
to
the
tropic
of
cancer
where
they
merge
into
what
are
called
the
mexican
indians
the
whole
of
this
nation
is
characterised
by
most
abject
cowardice
and
they
even
refuse
to
meet
the
helpless
mexicans
in
open
the
yuta
or
camanche
who
carry
bold
and
open
warfare
into
the
territories
of
their
civilised
enemy
and
never
shrink
from
hand
to
hand
encounter
the
apaches
and
the
degenerate
diggers
pursue
a
cowardly
warfare
hiding
in
ambush
and
shooting
the
with
arrows
or
dashing
upon
him
at
night
when
steeped
in
sleep
they
bury
their
arrow
to
the
feather
in
his
heaving
breast
as
the
mexicans
say
ventaja
no
they
never
attack
without
odds
but
they
are
not
the
less
dangerous
enemies
on
this
account
and
by
the
small
bands
of
trappers
who
visit
their
country
they
are
the
more
dreaded
by
reason
of
this
cowardly
and
wolfish
system
of
warfare
to
provide
against
surprise
therefore
as
the
hunters
rode
along
flankers
were
extended
on
each
side
mounting
the
high
points
to
reconnoitre
the
country
and
keeping
a
sharp
for
indian
sign
at
night
the
animals
were
securely
hobbled
and
a
posted
round
service
of
great
danger
as
the
stealthy
diggers
are
often
known
to
steal
up
silently
under
cover
of
the
darkness
towards
the
sentinel
shoot
him
with
their
arrows
and
approaching
the
animals
cut
the
hobbles
and
drive
them
away
unseen
one
night
they
encamped
on
a
creek
where
was
but
little
of
the
coarsest
pasture
and
that
little
scattered
here
and
there
so
that
they
were
compelled
to
allow
their
animals
to
roam
farther
than
usual
from
camp
in
search
of
food
four
of
the
hunters
however
accompanied
them
to
guard
against
surprise
whilst
but
half
of
those
in
camp
lay
down
to
sleep
the
others
with
rifles
in
their
hands
remaining
prepared
for
any
emergency
this
day
they
had
killed
one
of
their
two
for
food
game
not
having
been
met
with
for
several
days
but
the
animal
was
so
poor
that
it
scarcely
afforded
more
than
one
tolerable
meal
to
the
whole
party
a
short
time
before
the
dawn
of
day
an
alarm
was
given
the
animals
were
heard
to
snort
violently
a
loud
shout
was
heard
followed
by
the
sharp
crack
of
a
rifle
and
the
tramp
of
galloping
horses
plainly
showed
that
a
stampede
had
been
effected
the
whites
instantly
sprang
to
their
arms
and
rushed
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
the
body
of
the
cavallada
however
had
luckily
turned
and
being
headed
by
the
mountaineers
were
surrounded
and
secured
with
the
loss
of
only
three
which
had
probably
been
mounted
by
the
indians
day
breaking
soon
after
one
of
their
band
was
discovered
to
be
missing
and
it
was
then
found
that
a
man
who
had
been
standing
at
the
time
of
the
attack
had
not
come
into
camp
with
his
companions
at
that
moment
a
thin
spiral
column
of
smoke
was
seen
to
rise
from
the
banks
of
the
creek
telling
but
too
surely
the
fate
of
the
missing
mountaineer
it
was
the
signal
of
the
indians
to
their
people
that
a
had
been
struck
and
that
an
enemy
scalp
remained
in
their
triumphant
hands
exclaimed
the
trappers
in
a
breath
and
soon
imprecations
and
threats
of
revenge
loud
and
deep
were
showered
upon
the
heads
of
the
treacherous
indians
some
of
the
party
rushed
to
the
spot
where
the
guard
had
stood
and
there
lay
the
body
of
their
comrade
pierced
with
lance
and
arrow
the
scalp
gone
and
the
body
otherwise
mutilated
in
a
barbarous
manner
five
were
quickly
in
the
saddle
mounted
upon
the
strongest
horses
and
flying
along
the
track
of
the
indians
who
had
made
off
towards
the
mountains
with
their
prize
and
booty
we
will
not
follow
them
in
their
work
of
bloody
vengeance
save
by
saying
that
they
followed
the
savages
to
their
village
into
which
they
charged
headlong
recovered
their
stolen
horses
and
returned
to
camp
at
sundown
with
thirteen
scalps
dangling
from
their
rifles
in
payment
for
the
loss
of
their
unfortunate
companion
in
their
further
advance
hunger
and
thirst
were
their
daily
companions
they
were
compelled
to
kill
several
of
their
animals
for
food
but
were
fortunate
enough
to
replace
them
by
a
stroke
of
good
luck
in
meeting
a
party
of
indians
returning
from
an
excursion
against
one
of
the
californian
settlements
with
a
tolerably
large
band
of
horses
our
hunters
met
this
band
one
fine
morning
and
dashed
into
the
midst
at
once
half
a
dozen
indians
bit
the
dust
and
twenty
horses
were
turned
over
from
red
to
white
masters
in
as
many
seconds
which
remounted
those
whose
animals
had
been
eaten
and
enabled
the
others
to
exchange
their
steeds
for
fresh
ones
this
fortunate
event
was
considered
a
and
the
event
was
celebrated
by
the
slaughter
of
a
fat
young
horse
which
furnished
an
excellent
supper
that
memorable
event
in
these
starveling
regions
they
were
now
devouring
their
horses
and
mules
at
the
rate
of
one
every
alternate
day
for
so
poor
were
the
animals
that
one
scarcely
furnished
an
ample
meal
for
the
thirteen
hungry
hunters
they
were
once
more
reduced
to
the
animals
they
rode
on
and
after
a
fast
of
hours
duration
were
debating
on
the
propriety
of
drawing
lots
as
to
whose
rosinante
should
fill
the
kettle
when
some
indians
suddenly
appeared
making
signs
of
peace
upon
the
bluff
and
indicating
a
disposition
to
enter
the
camp
for
the
purpose
of
trading
being
invited
to
approach
they
offered
to
trade
a
few
dressed
but
being
asked
for
meat
they
said
that
their
village
was
a
long
way
off
and
they
had
nothing
with
them
but
a
small
portion
of
some
game
they
had
lately
killed
when
requested
to
produce
this
they
hesitated
but
the
trappers
looking
hungry
and
angry
at
the
same
moment
an
old
indian
drew
from
under
his
blanket
several
flaps
of
portable
dried
meat
which
he
declared
was
bear
it
was
but
a
small
ration
amongst
so
many
but
being
divided
was
quickly
laid
upon
the
fire
to
broil
the
meat
was
stringy
and
of
whitish
colour
altogether
unlike
any
flesh
the
trappers
had
before
eaten
killbuck
was
the
first
to
discover
this
he
had
been
quietly
masticating
the
last
mouthful
of
his
portion
the
stringiness
of
which
required
more
than
usual
dental
exertion
when
the
novelty
of
the
flavour
struck
him
as
something
singular
suddenly
his
jaws
ceased
their
work
he
thought
a
moment
took
the
morsel
from
his
mouth
looked
at
it
intently
and
dashed
it
into
the
fire
by
he
cried
out
and
at
the
words
every
jaw
stopped
work
the
trappers
looked
at
the
meat
and
each
other
i
if
it
ai
cried
old
walker
looking
at
his
piece
and
white
meat
at
that
wagh
and
report
said
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
tasted
such
viands
and
the
conviction
seizing
each
mind
every
mouthful
was
quickly
spat
into
the
fire
and
the
ire
of
the
deceived
whites
was
instantly
turned
upon
the
luckless
providers
of
the
feast
they
saw
the
storm
that
was
brewing
and
without
more
ado
turned
tail
from
the
camp
and
scuttled
up
the
bluffs
where
turning
round
they
fired
a
volley
of
arrows
at
the
tricked
mountaineers
and
instantly
disappeared
however
the
desert
and
its
nomade
pilferers
were
at
length
passed
the
sandy
plains
became
prairies
the
monstrous
cottonwood
on
the
creeks
was
replaced
by
oak
and
ash
the
surface
of
the
country
grew
more
undulating
and
less
broken
up
into
cañons
and
ravines
elk
and
deer
leaped
in
the
bottoms
and
bands
of
antelope
dotted
the
plains
with
occasional
troops
of
wild
horses
too
wary
to
allow
the
approach
of
man
on
the
banks
of
a
picturesque
stream
called
the
san
joaquim
the
party
halted
a
few
days
to
recruit
themselves
and
animals
feasting
the
while
on
the
fattest
of
venison
and
other
game
they
then
struck
to
the
for
two
days
until
they
reached
a
branch
of
the
las
animas
a
clear
stream
running
through
a
pretty
valley
well
timbered
and
abounding
in
game
here
as
they
wound
along
the
a
horseman
suddenly
appeared
upon
the
bluff
above
them
galloping
at
a
furious
rate
along
the
edge
his
dress
approached
in
some
degree
to
civilised
attire
a
sombrero
surmounted
his
swarthy
face
a
coloured
blanket
through
a
slit
in
which
his
head
was
thrust
floated
in
the
air
from
his
shoulders
leathern
leggings
encased
his
lower
limbs
and
huge
spurs
jingled
on
his
heels
he
rode
in
a
mexican
saddle
his
feet
thrust
in
ponderous
stirrups
and
in
his
hand
swung
a
coil
of
ready
lasso
his
only
offensive
arm
one
of
the
trappers
knew
a
little
spanish
and
instantly
hailed
him
he
shouted

the
californian
reined
in
suddenly
throwing
the
horse
he
rode
on
its
very
haunches
and
darting
down
the
bluff
galloped
unhesitatingly
into
the
midst
of
the
hunters
he
exclaimed
glancing
at
them
and
continued

you
want

for
this

all
this

ah
what

you
are
he
was
an
indian
employed
at
the
mission
of
san
fernando
distant
three
days
journey
from
their
present
position
and
was
now
searching
for
a
band
of
horses
and
mules
which
had
strayed
san
fernando
it
appeared
had
once
before
been
visited
by
a
party
of
mountain
and
the
indian
therefore
divined
the
object
of
the
present
one
he
was
he
told
them
indio
pero
an
indian
but
a
tame
one
mas
a
christian
moreover
exhibiting
a
small
cross
which
hung
round
his
neck
there
were
many
people
about
the
mission
he
said
who
knew
how
to
fight
and
had
plenty
of
arms
and
there
were
enough
to
eat
up
the
sin
without
beans
as
he
facetiously
observed
for
his
part
however
he
was
very
friendly
to
the
he
had
once
met
a
man
of
that
nation
who
was
a
good
sort
of
fellow
and
had
made
him
a
present
of
tobacco
of
which
he
was
particularly
fond
finding
this
hint
did
not
take
he
said
that
the
horses
and
mules
belonging
to
the
mission
were
like
that
he
added
sweeping
his
hand
to
all
points
of
the
compass
over
the
plain
to
intimate
that
they
would
cover
that
extent
and
he
could
point
out
a
large
herd
grazing
nearer
at
hand
than
the
mission
and
guarded
but
by
three
regaled
with
venison
and
with
a
smoke
of
his
coveted
tobacco
he
rode
off
and
made
his
way
to
the
mission
without
delay
conveying
the
startling
intelligence
that
a
thousand
americans
were
upon
them
the
next
morning
the
thirteen
doughty
mountaineers
quietly
resumed
their
journey
moving
leisurely
along
towards
the
object
of
their
expedition
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
digress
a
little
in
order
to
describe
the
singular
features
of
the
establishments
formed
in
those
remote
regions
by
the
catholic
church
as
nuclei
round
which
to
concentrate
the
wandering
tribes
that
inhabit
the
country
with
a
view
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
civilised
example
and
to
wean
them
from
their
restless
nomadic
habits
the
establishment
of
missions
in
upper
california
is
coeval
with
the
first
settlement
of
southern
mexico
no
sooner
had
spanish
rule
taken
a
firm
in
the
aztec
empire
than
the
avowed
primary
object
of
the
military
expedition
began
to
be
carried
into
effect
to
save
the
souls
of
the
savage
and
barbarous
subjects
of
their
most
catholic
majesties
was
ever
inculcated
upon
the
governors
of
the
conquered
country
as
the
grand
object
to
be
sought
after
as
soon
as
tranquillity
was
partially
restored
by
the
submission
of
the
mexicans
and
the
cross
the
sacred
emblem
of
the
catholic
faith
was
to
be
upraised
in
the
remotest
corners
of
the
country
and
the
natives
instructed
and
compelled
to
worship
it
in
lieu
of
the
grotesque
images
of
their
own
idolatrous
religion
to
carry
into
effect
these
orthodox
instructions
troops
of
pious
priests
of
friars
and
monks
of
every
order
and
even
of
saintly
nuns
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
victorious
armies
of
cortez
and
girding
up
their
loins
with
zealous
fervour
and
enthusiasm
and
with
an
enterprise
and
hardihood
worthy
of
buccaneers
they
pushed
their
adventurous
way
far
into
the
bowels
of
the
land
preaching
devoutly
and
with
commendable
perseverance
to
savages
who
did
not
understand
a
syllable
of
what
they
so
eloquently
discoursed
and
returning
after
the
lapse
of
many
months
passed
in
this
first
attempt
with
glowing
accounts
of
the
buen
the
very
ductile
disposition
of
the
savages
and
of
the
thousands
they
had
converted
to
santa
fé
ferdinand
and
isabel
of
glorious
memory
at
once
beat
up
for
volunteers
crowds
of
franciscan
monks
greasy
capuchinos
and
nuns
of
orthodox
odour
joined
the

and
saints
even
of
the
feminine
gender
long
since
canonised
and
up
aloft
amongst
the
goodly
muster
of
saints
and
martyrs
put
foot
once
more
on
and
rosary
in
hand
crossed
the
seas
to
participate
in
the
good
work
as
proof
of
this
latter
fact
one
venabides
a
franciscan
whose
veracity
is
beyond
impeachment
declared
that
while
preaching
in
the
regions
now
known
as
new
mexico
one
million
indians
from
the
rumbo
known
as
cibolo
a
mighty
nation
approached
his
temporary
pulpit
on
the
rio
grande
and
requested
in
a
body
the

struck
with
the
singularity
of
this
request
from
indians
with
whom
he
had
as
yet
held
no
communication
and
with
conscientious
scruple
as
to
whether
he
would
be
justified
in
performing
such
ceremony
without
their
having
received
previous
instruction
he
hesitated
a
few
moments
before
making
an
answer
at
this
juncture
the
indians
espied
a
medallion
which
hung
around
his
neck
bearing
the
effigy
of
a
certain
saint
of
extraordinary
virtue
at
sight
of
this
they
fell
on
their
knees
before
it
and
it
was
some
time
before
they
found
words
in
what
language
does
not
appear
to
explain
to
the
holy
father
that
the
original
of
that
effigy
which
hung
pendant
from
his
neck
had
been
long
amongst
them
instructing
them
in
the
elements
of
the
christian
religion
and
had
only
lately
disappeared
informing
them
that
certain
reverend
men
would
shortly
appear
in
the
land
who
would
finish
the
good
work
she
had
devoutly
commenced
and
clench
the
business
by
baptising
the
one
million
miserable
sinners
who
now
knelt
before
el

venabides
valgame

reverently
exclaimed
that
worthy
man
qui
milagro

este
what
a
miracle
is
this
i
hear
and
casting
up
his
eyes
and
speaking
slowly
as
if
he
weighed
every
word
and
taxing
his
memory
of
the

calendar

continued

oh
what
a

is
this
the

devoutly
after
so
many
ages
spent
in
heaven
in
company
of
the
angels
of

holy
men
and
of

the
most
pure
and
perhaps
also
in
the
company
of
my
worthy
and
esteemed
friend
and
patron
don

who
died
a

years

in

where
sobbed

bellowed
the

either

and
what
is
the
name
of
this
holy
woman
the
world
will
ask
continues
venabides
santa
clara
of
carmona
is
her
name
one
well
known
in
my
native
country
who
leaves
heaven
and
all
its
joys
wends
her
way
to
the
distant
wilds
of
new
spain
and
spends
years
in
inducting
the
savage
people
to
the
holy
faith
truly
a
pious
work
and
pleasing
to
god
thus
spoke
venabides
the
franciscan
and
no
doubt
he
believed
what
he
said
and
many
others
in
old
spain
were
fools
enough
to
believe
it
too
for
the
shaven
heads
flocked
over
in
greater
numbers
and
the
cry
was
ever
still
they
along
the
whole
extent
of
the
not
an
indian
tribe
but
was
speedily
visited
by
the
preaching
friars
and
monks
and
in
less
than
a
century
after
the
conquest
of
mexico
by
the
spaniards
these
hardy
and
enthusiastic
frayles
had
pushed
their
way
into
the
inhospitable
regions
of
new
mexico
nearly
two
thousand
miles
distant
from
the
valley
of
anahuac
how
they
succeeded
in
surmounting
the
natural
obstacles
presented
by
the
wild
and
barren
deserts
they
traversed
how
they
escaped
the
infinite
peril
they
encountered
at
every
step
at
the
hands
of
the
savage
inhabitants
of
the
country
with
whose
language
they
were
totally
unacquainted
is
sufficient
puzzle
to
those
who
in
the
present
day
have
attempted
a
journey
in
the
same
regions
however
it
is
impossible
not
to
admire
the
hardihood
of
these
holy
pioneers
of
civilisation
who
totally
unfitted
by
their
former
mode
of
life
for
undergoing
such
hardships
as
they
must
have
anticipated
threw
themselves
into
the
wilderness
with
fearless
and
stubborn
zeal
for
the
most
part
however
they
found
the
indians
exceedingly
hospitable
and
well
disposed
and
it
was
not
until
some
time
receiving
from
the
missionary
monks
glowing
and
not
always
very
truthful
accounts
of
the
riches
of
the
country
in
which
they
had
located
themselves
the
governors
of
mexico
despatched
armed
expeditions
under
adventurous
desperadoes
to
take
and
retain
possession
of
the
said
country
with
orders
to
compel
the
submission
of
the
native
tribes
and
enforce
their
obedience
to
the
authority
of
the
the
simple
and
confiding
indians
began
to
see
the
folly
they
had
committed
in
permitting
the
residence
amongst
them
of
these
superior
beings
whom
they
had
first
looked
upon
as
more
than
mortal
but
who
when
strong
enough
to
do
so
were
not
long
in
throwing
off
the
mask
and
proving
to
the
simple
savages
that
they
were
much
more
human
than
thus
in
the
province
of
new
mexico
fray
augustin
ruiz
with
his
marcos
and
venabides
were
kindly
received
by
the
native
inhabitants
and
we
have
seen
how
one
million
indians
came
from
the
rumbo
of
the
cibolo
ready
and
willing
to
receive
the
baptismal
sacrament
this
cibolo
or
sivulo
as
it
is
written
in
some
old
is
by
the
way
mysteriously
alluded
to
by
the
monkish
historians
who
have
written
on
this
region
as
being
a
kingdom
inhabited
by
a
very
superior
class
of
indians
to
any
met
with
between
anahuac
and
the
vale
of
the
enjoyment
of
a
high
state
of
civilisation
inhabiting
a
city
the
houses
of
which
were
three
stories
high
and
having
attained
considerable
perfection
in
the
domestic
arts
this
notwithstanding
the
authority
of
don
francisco
vasquez
coronado
who
visited
cibolo
and
of
solis
and
venegas
who
have
guaranteed
the
assertion
must
be
received
grano
but
at
all
events
the
civilisation
of
the
mysterious
cibolo
may
be
compared
to
that
of
the
aztec
empire
under
montezuma
at
the
time
of
the
spanish
conquest
both
being
egregiously
exaggerated
by
the
historians
of
the
day
cibolo
was
situated
on
a
river
called
tegue
at
this
day
neither
name
is
known
to
the
inhabitants
of
new
mexico
if
venabides
had
held
his
tongue
new
mexico
might
now
be
in
the
peaceful
possession
of
the
catholic
missions
and
the
property
of
the
church
of
mexico
pretty
considerably
enhanced
by
the
valuable
or
gold
washings
which
abound
in
that
province
full
however
of
the
wonderful
miracle
of
santa
clara
of
carmona
which
had
been
brought
to
light
through
the
agency
of
the
medallion
at
the
end
of
his
rosario
fray
venabides
must
needs
return
to
spain
and
humbug
poor
old

and
even
the
more
sensible
isabel
with
wonderful
accounts
of
the
riches
of
the
country

had
been
instrumental
in
exploring
and
of
the
excellent
disposition
of
the
natives
to
receive
the
word
of
god
don

oñate
was
therefore
quickly
despatched
to
take
possession
and
in
his
train
followed
twelve
castilian
families
of
to
colonise
the
territory
the
names
of
these
still
remain
disgraced
by
the
degenerate
wretches
who
now
bear
them
but
in
whom
scarce
a
drop
of
blood
remains
which
ever
filtered
from
the
veins
of
the
paladins

times

missions

upheld
by
dint
of
steel

frequently
the

rose

the

more
than

from

and
were
only
reinstated
by
the
aid
of
large

of

they
managed
these
things
better
the
wily
monks
took
care
to
keep
all
interlopers
from
the
country
established
themselves
in
snug
quarters
instructed
the
indians
in
agriculture
and
soon
gained
such
an
ascendancy
over
them
that
no

was
experienced
in
keeping
them

and

for

he
might

when

and
ran
off
with
so
many
of
our
true
reverend

answered
the

just
three
years

all
but
fifteen
days
i
remember
it
well
them
how
many
did
we
kill
josé
quizas
great
many
i
dare
say
but
they
did
not
fight
right
upon
us
and
gave
us
no
time
to
do
any
thing
they
do
know
how
to
fight
these
mericanos
come
right
at
you
before
you
can
swing
a
lasso
hallooing
like
indios
but
josé
how
many
did
they
leave
dead
on
the
field
not
and
we
valgame
dios
thirteen
dead
and
many
more
that
it
now
if
these
savages
come
again
and
the
chemeguaba
who
came
in
yesterday
says
he
saw
a
large
trail
we
must
fight
is
no
go
for
as
you
very
properly
say
josé
these
americans
do
know
how
to

kill
us
we
can
kill
them

where
having
a
most
perfect
contempt
for
every
thing
mexican
and
hearing
that
in
the
mission
of
san
fernando
far
away
were
a
couple
of
spanish
padres
of
sangre
regular
he
had
started
into
the
wilderness
to
ferret
them
out
and
having
escaped
all
dangers
on
the
route
which
however
were
hardly
dangers
to
the
don
who
could
not
realise
the
idea
of
savages
had
arrived
with
a
whole
skin
at
the
mission
there
he
was
received
with
open
arms
by
his
countryman
fray
augustin
who
made
him
welcome
to
all
the
place
afforded
and
there
he
harmlessly
smoked
away
his
time
his
heart
far
away
on
the
banks
of
the
genil
and
in
the
vegas
of
his
beloved
andalusia
his
withered
cuerpo
in
the
sierras
of
upper
california
don
antonio
was
the
walking
essence
of
a
spaniard
of
the
his
family
dated
from
the
flood
and
with
the
exception
of
sundry
refreshing
jets
of
moorish
blood
injected
into
the
truebas
during
the
moorish
epoch
no
strange
shoot
was
ever
engrafted
on
their
genealogical
tree
the
marriages
of
the
family
were
ever
confined
to
the
family
looking
to
fresh
blood
in
a
station
immediately
below
it
which
was
not
hidalgueño
nor
above
since
any
thing
higher
in
rank
than
the
trueba
y
trueba
family
there
was
not
thus
in
the
male
and
female
scions
of
the
house
were
plainly
visible
the
ill
effects
of
breeding
in
and
the
male
truebas
were
sadly
degenerate
dons
in
body
as
in
to
their
ancestors
of
boabdil
day
and
the
señoritas
of
the
name
were
all
eyes
and
eyes
alone
and
hardly
of
such
stamp
as
would
have
tempted
that
amorous
monarch
to
bestow
a
kingdom
for
a
kiss
as
ancient
ballads
tell

such
poor

and

and

don
antonio
would
not
have
shone
even
amongst
pigmy
mexicans
for
physical
beauty
five
feet
high
a
framework
of
bones
covered
with
a
skin
of
andalusian
tint
the
trueba
stood
erect
and
stiff
in
all
the
consciousness
of
his
sangre
his
features
were
handsome
but
entirely
devoid
of
flesh
his
upper
lip
was
covered
with
a
mustache
mixed
with
gray
his
chin
was
bearded
like
the
every
one
around
him
clad
in
deer
and
goat
skin
our
don
walked
conspicuous
in
shining
suit
of
the
worse
for
wear
it
must
be
beaver
hat
sadly
battered
and
round
his
body
and
over
his
shoulder
an
unexceptionable
capa
of
the
amplest
dimensions
asking
as
he
stepped
over
him
the
pardon
of
an
indian
urchin
who
blocked
the
door
and
bowing
with
punctilious
politeness
to
the
sturdy
mozas
who
were
grinding
corn
don
antonio
approached
our
friend
augustin
who
was
discussing
warlike
matters
with
his
administrador
hola
don
antonio
how
do
you
find
yourself
sir
perfectly
well
and
your
very
humble
servant
reverend
father
and
your
worship
also
i
trust
you
are
in
good
health
novelty
which
since
it
was
one
hour
and
a
half
since
our
friends
had
separated
to
take
their
siestas
was
not
impossible
myself
and
the
worthy
josé
continued
fray
augustin
were
speaking
of
the
vile
invasion
of
a
band
of
north
american
robbers
who
three
years
since
fiercely
assaulted
this
peaceful
mission
killing
many
of
its
inoffensive
inhabitants
wounding
many
more
and
carrying
off
several
of
our
finest
colts
and
most
promising
mules
to
their
dens
and
caves
in
the
rocky
mountains
not
with
impunity
however
did
they
effect
this
atrocity
josé
informs
me
that
many
of
the
assailants
were
killed
by
my
brave
indians
how
many
said
you
josé
quizas
answered
the
indian
yes
probably
a
great
multitude
continued
the
padre
but
unwarned
by
such
castigation
it
has
been
reported
to
me
by
a
chemeguaba
mansito
that
a
band
of
these
audacious
marauders
are
now
on
the
road
to
repeat
the
offence
numbering
many
thousands
well
mounted
and
armed
and
to
oppose
these
white
barbarians
it
behoves
us
to
make
every
preparation
of
there
is
no
cause
for
alarm
answered
the
andaluz
i
tapping
his
breast
have
served
in
three
wars
in
that
glorious
one
la
independencia
when
our
glorious
patriots
drove
the
french
like
sheep
across
the
pyrenees
in
that
equally
glorious
one
of
and
in
the
late
magnanimous
struggle
for
the
legitimate
rights
of
his
majesty
charles

cried
the
spirited

his
shrivelled

for
my

mowing
down
its
enemies
before

and
with
it
vehemently
exclaimed
the
gachupin
working
himself
into
a
perfect
frenzy
i

slay
these
norte

should
they
dare
to
show
their

he
cried
doffing
his

with
an
bow
i
go
to

my
sword
till
then
a
countryman
of
mine
said
the
frayle
admiringly
to
the
administrador
with
him
by
our
side
we
need
not
to
fear
neither
norte
americanos
nor
the
devil
himself
can
harm
us
when
he
is
whilst
the
trueba
sharpens
his
tizona
and
the
priest
puffs
volumes
of
smoke
from
his
nose
and
mouth
let
us
introduce
to
the
reader
one
of
the
muchachitas
who
knelt
grinding
corn
on
the
metate
to
make
tortillas
for
the
evening
meal
juanita
was
a
stout
wench
from
sonora
of
mexican
blood
hardly
as
dark
as
the
other
women
who
surrounded
her
and
with
a
drop
or
two
of
the
old
spanish
blood
struggling
with
the
darker
indian
tint
to
colour
her
plump
cheeks
an
enagua
a
short
petticoat
of
red
serge
was
confined
round
her
waist
by
a
gay
band
ornamented
with
beads
and
a
chemisette
covered
the
upper
part
of
the
body
permitting
however
a
prodigal
display
of
her
charms
whilst
pounding
sturdily
at
the
corn
she
laughed
and
joked
with
her
upon
the
anticipated
american
attack
which
appeared
to
have
but
few
terrors
for
her
que
vengan
she
let
them
come
they
are
only
men
and
will
not
molest
us
women
besides
i
have
seen
these
white
men
my
own
country
and
they
are
fine
fellows
very
tall
and
as
white
as
the
snow
on
the
sierras
let
them
come
say
i
only
hear
the
girl
cried
another
if
these
savages
come
then
will
they
kill
pedrillo
and
what
will
juanita
say
to
lose
her
sweetheart
pedrillo
sneered
the
latter
what
care
i
for
pedrillo
soy
mejicana
mexican
girl
am
i
i
have
you
know
and
do
demean
me
to
look
at
a
wild
indian
not
i
indeed
by
my
salvation
what
i
say
is
let
the
norte
americanos
at
this
juncture
fray
augustin
called
for
a
glass
of
aguardiente
which
juanita
was
despatched
to
bring
and
on
presenting
it
the
churchman
facetiously
inquired
why
she
wished
for
the
americans
adding
do
think
they
come
no
here
we
are
brave
men
and
have
don
antonio
with
us
a
noble
fellow
well
used
to
as
the
words
were
on
his
lips
the
clattering
of
a
horse
hoofs
was
heard
rattling
across
the
loose
stones
and
pebbles
in
the
bed
of
the
river
and
presently
an
indian
herder
galloped
up
to
the
door
of
the
mission
his
horse
covered
with
foam
and
its
sides
bleeding
from
oh
padre
mio
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
his
reverence
vienen
los
americans
the
americans
are
upon
us
ave
maria
purissima
than
ten
thousand
are
at
my
heels
up
started
the
priest
and
shouted
for
the
don
that
hidalgo
presently
appeared
armed
with
the
sword
that
had
graced
his
thigh
in
so
many
glorious
sword
with
which
he
had
mowed
down
the
enemies
of
his
country
and
by
whose
aid
he
now
proposed
to
annihilate
the
american
savages
should
they
dare
to
appear
before
him
the
alarm
was
instantly
given
peones
vagueros
hurried
from
the
plains
and
milpas
warned
by
the
bell
which
soon
rung
out
its
sonorous
alarum
a
score
of
mounted
indians
armed
with
gun
and
lasso
dashed
off
to
bring
intelligence
of
the
enemy
the
old
gingall
on
the
roof
was
crammed
with
powder
and
bullets
to
the
very
muzzle
by
the
frayle
own
hand
arms
were
brought
and
piled
in
the
sala
ready
for
use
the
padre
exhorted
the
women
screamed
the
men
grew
pale
and
nervous
and
thronged
within
the
walls
don
antonio
the
fiery
andaluz
alone
remained
outside
flourishing
his
whetted
sabre
and
roaring
to
the
padre
who
stood
on
the
roof
with
lighted
match
by
the
side
of
his
formidable
cannon
not
to
be
affrighted
that
he
the
trueba
was
there
with
his
tizona
ready
to
defeat
the
devil
himself
should
he
come
he
was
deaf
to
the
entreaties
of
the
priest
to
enter
siempre
en
el
in
the
van
he
said
was
the
of
the
but
now
a
cloud
of
dust
was
seen
approaching
from
the
plain
and
presently
a
score
of
horsemen
dashed
headlong
towards
the
mission
el
enemigo
shouted
fray
augustin
and
without
waiting
to
aim
he
clapped
his
match
to
the
of
the
gun
harmlessly
pointed
to
the
sky
and
crying
out
in
el
nombre
de
dios
god
he
did
so
was
instantly
knocked
over
and
over
by
the
recoil
of
the
piece
then
was
as
instantly
seized
by
some
of
the
indian
garrison
and
forced
through
the
into
the
building
whilst
the
horsemen
who
were
his
own
scouts
galloped
up
with
the
intelligence
that
the
enemy
was
at
hand
and
in
overwhelming
force
thereupon
the
men
were
all
mounted
and
formed
in
a
body
before
the
building
to
the
amount
of
more
than
fifty
well
armed
with
guns
or
bows
and
arrows
here
the
gallant
don
harangued
them
and
infusing
into
their
hearts
a
little
of
his
own
courage
they
eagerly
demanded
to
be
led
against
the
enemy
fray
augustin
on
the
roof
gave
them
his
blessing
advised
them
to
give
no
quarter
and
with
slight
misgivings
saw
them
ride
off
to
the
conflict
about
a
mile
from
the
mission
the
plain
gradually
ascended
to
a
ridge
of
moderate
elevation
on
which
was
a
growth
of
dwarf
oak
and
ilex
to
this
point
the
eyes
of
the
remaining
inmates
of
the
convent
were
earnestly
directed
as
here
the
enemy
was
first
expected
to
make
his
appearance
presently
a
few
figures
were
seen
to
crown
the
ridge
clearly
defined
against
the
clear
evening
sky
not
more
than
a
dozen
mounted
men
composed
this
party
which
all
imagined
must
be
doubtless
the
vanguard
of
the
thousand
invaders
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
they
halted
a
few
minutes
as
if
to
reconnoitre
and
by
this
time
the
californian
horsemen
were
halted
in
the
plain
midway
between
the
mission
and
the
ridge
and
distant
from
the
former
less
than
so
that
all
the
operations
were
clearly
visible
to
the
the
enemy
wound
slowly
in
indian
file
down
the
broken
ground
of
the
descent
but
when
the
plain
was
reached
they
formed
into
something
like
a
line
and
trotted
fearlessly
towards
the
californians
these
began
to
sit
uneasily
in
their
saddles
nevertheless
they
made
a
forward
movement
and
even
broke
into
a
gallop
but
soon
halted
and
again
huddled
together
then
the
mountaineers
quickened
their
pace
and
their
loud
shout
was
heard
as
they
dashed
into
the
middle
of
the
faltering
troop
the
sharp
cracks
of
the
rifles
followed
and
the
duller
reports
of
the
pieces
of
the
californians
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
dust
arose
from
the
plain
and
immediately
horses
with
empty
saddles
broke
from
it
followed
quickly
by
the
californians
flying
like
mad
across
the
level
the
little
steady
line
of
the
mountaineers
advanced
and
puffs
of
smoke
arose
as
they
loaded
and
discharged
their
rifles
at
the
flying
horsemen
as
the
americans
came
on
however
one
was
seen
to
totter
in
his
saddle
the
rifle
fell
from
his
grasp
and
he
tumbled
headlong
to
the
ground
for
an
instant
his
companions
surrounded
the
fallen
man
but
again
forming
dashed
towards
the
mission
shouting
fierce
and
brandishing
aloft
their
long
and
heavy
rifles
of
the
defeated
californians
some
jumped
off
their
horses
at
the
door
of
the
mission
and
sought
shelter
within
others
galloped
off
towards
the
sierra
in
plight
before
the
gate
however
still
paced
valiantly
the
proud
hidalgo
encumbered
with
his
cloak
and
waving
with
difficulty
his
sword
above
his
head
to
the
priest
and
women
who
implored
him
to
enter
he
replied
with
cries
of
defiance
viva
carlos
quinto
and
death
or
he
shouted
in
vain
to
the
flying
crowd
to
halt
but
seeing
their
panic
was
beyond
hope
he
clutched
his
weapon
more
firmly
as
the
americans
dashed
at
him
closed
his
teeth
and
his
eyes
thought
once
of
the
vega
of
his
beloved
genil
and
of
granada
la
florida
and
gave
himself
up
for
lost
those
inside
the
mission
when
they
observed
the
flight
of
their
cavalry
gave
up
the
defence
as
hopeless
and
already
the
charging
mountaineers
were
almost
under
the
walls
when
they
observed
the
curious
figure
of
the
little
don
making
demonstrations
of
hostility
wagh
exclaimed
the
leading
hunter
no
other
than
our
friend
la
bonté
here
a
little
crittur
as
means
to
do
all
the
fighting
and
seizing
his
rifle
by
the
barrel
he
poked
at
the
don
with
the
who
parried
the
blow
and
with
such
a
sturdy
stroke
as
nearly
severed
the
stock
in
two
another
mountaineer
rode
up
and
swinging
his
lasso
overhead
threw
the
noose
dexterously
over
the
spaniard
head
and
as
it
fell
over
his
shoulders
drew
it
taut
thus
securing
the
arms
of
the
pugnacious
don
as
in
a
vice
quartel
cried
the
latter
por
dios
quartel
quarter
be
exclaimed
one
of
the
whites
who
understood
spanish
who
agoin
to
hurt
you
you
little
crittur
by
this
time
fray
augustin
was
waving
a
white
flag
from
the
roof
in
token
of
surrender
and
soon
after
he
appeared
trembling
at
the
door
beseeching
the
victors
to
be
merciful
and
to
spare
the
lives
of
the
vanquished
when
all
and
every
thing
in
the
mission
would
be
freely
placed
at
their
disposal
what
does
the
niggur
say
asked
old
walker
the
leader
of
the
mountaineers
of
the
interpreter
well
he
talks
so
queer
this
hos
ca
rightly
make
it
tell
the
old
coon
then
to
quit
that
and
make
them
darned
greasers
clear
out
of
the
lodge
and
pock
some
corn
and
shucks
here
for
the
animals
for
they
nigh
give
this
being
conveyed
to
him
in
mountain
spanish
which
fear
alone
made
him
understand
the
padre
gave
orders
to
the
men
to
leave
the
mission
advising
them
moreover
not
to
recommence
hostilities
as
himself
was
kept
as
hostage
and
if
a
finger
was
lifted
against
the
mountaineers
he
would
be
killed
at
once
and
the
mission
burned
to
the
ground
once
inside
the
hunters
had
no
fear
of
attack
they
could
have
kept
the
building
against
all
california
so
leaving
a
guard
of
two
outside
the
gate
and
first
seeing
their
animals
supplied
with
piles
of
corn
and
shucks
they
made
themselves
at
home
and
soon
were
paying
attention
to
the
hot
tortillas
meat
and
chile
colorado
which
were
quickly
placed
before
them
washing
down
the
viands
with
deep
draughts
of
wine
and
brandy
it
would
have
been
amusing
to
have
seen
the
faces
of
these
rough
fellows
as
they
gravely
pledged
each
other
in
the
grateful
liquor
and
looked
askance
at
the
piles
of
fruit
served
by
the
attendant
hebes
these
came
in
for
no
little
share
of
attention
it
may
be
imagined
but
the
utmost
respect
was
paid
to
them
for
your
mountaineer
rough
and
though
he
be
never
by
word
or
deed
offends
the
modesty
of
a
woman
although
sometimes
obliged
to
use
a
compulsory
wooing
when
time
is
not
allowed
for
regular
courtship
and
not
unfrequently
known
to
jerk
a
new
mexican
or
californian
beauty
behind
his
saddle
should
the
obdurate
parents
refuse
consent
to
their
immediate
union
it
tickled
the
americans
not
a
little
to
have
all
their
wants
supplied
and
to
be
thus
waited
upon
by
what
they
considered
the
houris
of
paradise
and
after
their
long
journey
and
the
many
hardships
and
privations
they
had
suffered
their
present
luxurious
situation
seemed
scarcely
real
the
hidalgo
released
from
the
durance
vile
of
the
lasso
assisted
at
the
entertainment
his
sense
of
what
was
due
to
the
sangre
regular
which
ran
in
his
veins
being
appeased
by
the
fact
that
he
sat
the
wild
uncouth
mountaineers
these
preferring
to
squat
on
the
floor
in
their
own
fashion
to
the
uncomfortable
and
novel
luxury
of
a
chair
killbuck
indeed
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
the
use
of
such
pieces
of
furniture
on
fray
augustin
offering
him
one
and
begging
him
with
many
protestations
to
be
seated
that
old
mountain
worthy
looked
at
it
and
then
at
the
padre
turned
it
round
and
at
length
comprehending
the
intention
essayed
to
sit
this
he
effected
at
last
and
sat
grimly
for
some
moments
when
seizing
the
chair
by
the
back
he
hurled
it
out
of
the
open
door
exclaiming
wagh
this
coon
aint
hamshot
anyhow
and
do
want
such
fixins
he
do
and
gathering
his
legs
under
his
body
reclined
in
the
manner
customary
to
him
there
was
a
prodigious
quantity
of
liquor
consumed
that
night
the
hunters
making
up
for
their
many
banyans
but
as
it
was
the
pure
juice
of
the
grape
it
had
little
or
no
effect
upon
their
hard
heads
they
had
not
much
to
fear
from
attacks
on
the
part
of
the
californians
but
to
provide
against
all
emergencies
the
padre
and
the
gachupin
were
hobbled
and
confined
in
an
inner
room
to
which
there
was
no
ingress
nor
egress
save
through
the
door
which
opened
into
the
apartment
where
the
mountaineers
lay
sleeping
two
of
the
number
keeping
watch
a
fandango
with
the
indian
girls
had
been
proposed
by
some
of
them
but
walker
placed
a
decided
veto
on
this
he
said
they
had
need
of
sleep
now
for
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
bring
forth
that
they
had
a
long
journey
before
them
and
winter
was
coming
on
they
would
have
to
it
night
and
day
and
sleep
when
their
journey
was
over
which
would
not
be
until
pike
peak
was
left
behind
them
it
was
now
october
and
the
way
they
have
to
hump
it
back
to
the
mountains
would
take
the
gristle
off
a
painter
young
ned
wooton
was
not
to
the
fore
when
the
roll
was
called
he
was
courting
the
sonora
wench
juanita
and
to
some
purpose
for
we
may
at
once
observe
that
the
maiden
accompanied
the
mountaineer
to
his
distant
home
and
at
the
present
moment
is
sharing
his
lodge
on
creek
of
the
upper
arkansa
having
been
duly
and
legally
married
by
fray
augustin
before
their
departure
but
now
the
snow
on
the
ridge
of
the
sierra
madre
and
the
nightly
frosts
the
angular
flights
of
geese
and
ducks
constantly
passing
overhead
the
sober
tints
of
the
foliage
and
the
dead
leaves
that
strew
the
ground
the
withering
grass
on
the
plain
and
the
cold
gusts
sometimes
laden
with
snow
and
sleet
that
sweep
from
the
distant
mountains
these
signs
warn
us
to
linger
no
longer
in
the
tempting
valley
of
san
fernando
but
at
once
to
pack
our
mules
to
cross
the
dreary
and
desert
plains
and
inhospitable
sierras
and
to
seek
with
our
booty
one
of
the
sheltered
bayous
of
the
rocky
mountains
on
the
third
day
after
their
arrival
behold
our
mountaineers
again
upon
the
march
driving
before
the
assistance
of
indians
impressed
for
the
first
few
days
of
the
journey
until
the
cavallada
get
accustomed
to
travel
without
band
of
four
hundred
head
of
mules
and
horses
themselves
mounted
on
the
strongest
and
fleetest
they
could
select
from
at
least
a
thousand
fray
augustin
and
the
hidalgo
from
the
watched
them
depart
the
former
glad
to
get
rid
of
such
unscrupulous
guests
at
any
cost
the
latter
rather
loath
to
part
with
his
boon
companions
with
whom
he
had
quaffed
many
a
quartillo
of
californian
wine
great
was
the
grief
and
violent
the
sobbing
when
all
the
girls
in
the
mission
surrounded
juanita
to
bid
her
adieu
as
she
seated
en
cavalier
on
an
easy
pacing
mule
bequeathed
her
late
companions
to
the
keeping
of
every
saint
in
the
calendar
and
particularly
to
the
great
st
ferdinand

under
whose
especial
tutelage
all
those
in
the
mission
were
supposed
to
live

poor
forsaken
pedrillo
a
sullen
sulky
was
overcome
not
with
grief
but
with
anger
at
the
slight
put
upon
him
and
vowed
revenge
he
of
the
sangre
regular
having
not
a
particle
of
enmity
in
his
heart
waved
his
arm
with
which
he
had
mowed
down
the
enemies
of
carlos
requested
the
mountaineers
if
ever
fate
should
carry
them
to
spain
not
to
fail
to
visit
his
quinta
in
the
vega
of
genil
which
with
all
in
it
he
placed
at
their
worships
muchissima
franqueza
fat
fray
augustin
likewise
waved
his
arm
but
groaned
in
spirit
as
he
beheld
the
noble
band
of
mules
and
horses
throwing
back
clouds
of
dust
on
the
plain
where
they
had
been
bred
one
noble
roan
stallion
seemed
averse
to
leave
his
accustomed
pasture
and
again
and
again
broke
away
from
the
band
luckily
old
walker
had
taken
the
precaution
to
secure
the
of
the
herd
and
mounted
on
her
rode
ahead
the
animals
all
following
their
leader
as
the
roan
galloped
back
the
padre
was
in
ecstasy
it
was
a
favourite
steed
and
one
he
would
have
gladly
ransomed
at
any
price
ya
viene
ya
viene
he
cried
out
now
now
it
coming
hurra
for
the
roan
but
under
the
rifle
of
a
mountaineer
one
of
the
californians
dashed
at
it
a
lasso
whirling
round
his
head
and
turning
and
twisting
like
a
doubling
hare
as
the
horse
tried
to
avoid
him
at
last
threw
the
open
coil
over
the
animal
head
and
led
him
back
in
triumph
to
the
band
maldito
sea
aquel
that
indian
quoth
the
padre
and
turned
away
and
now
our
sturdy
two
who
had
gone
fairly
on
their
way
they
passed
the
body
of
their
comrade
who
had
been
killed
in
the
fight
before
the
mission
the
wolves
or
indian
dogs
had
picked
it
to
the
bones
but
a
mound
near
by
surrounded
by
a
rude
cross
showed
where
the
californians
seven
of
whom
were
killed
had
been
pile
of
stones
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
testifying
that
many
an
had
already
been
said
by
the
poor
indians
to
save
the
souls
of
their
slaughtered
companions
from
the
pangs
of
purgatory
for
the
first
few
days
progress
was
slow
and
tedious
the
confusion
attendant
upon
driving
so
large
a
number
of
animals
over
a
country
without
trail
or
track
of
any
description
was
sufficient
to
prevent
speedy
travelling
and
the
mountaineers
desirous
of
improving
the
pace
resolved
to
pursue
a
course
more
easterly
and
to
endeavour
to
strike
the
great
spanish
trail
which
is
the
route
followed
by
the
new
mexicans
in
their
journeys
to
and
from
the
towns
of
puebla
de
los
angeles
and
santa
fé
this
road
however
crosses
a
long
stretch
of
desert
country
destitute
alike
of
grass
and
water
save
at
a
few
points
the
regular
of
the
caravans
and
as
but
little
pasture
is
to
be
found
at
these
places
at
any
time
there
was
great
reason
to
doubt
if
the
santa
fé
traders
had
passed
this
season
that
there
would
not
be
sufficient
grass
to
support
the
numerous
cavallada
after
the
herbage
had
been
laid
under
contribution
by
the
animals
however
a
great
saving
of
time
would
be
effected
by
taking
this
trail
although
it
wound
a
considerable
distance
out
of
the
way
to
avoid
the
impassable
chain
of
the
sierra
gap
in
those
mountains
through
which
the
americans
had
come
being
far
to
the
southward
and
at
this
late
season
probably
obstructed
by
the
snow
urged
by
threats
and
bribes
one
of
the
indians
agreed
to
guide
the
cavallada
to
the
trail
which
he
declared
was
not
more
than
five
days
distant
as
they
advanced
the
country
became
wilder
and
more
sterile
valleys
through
which
several
small
streams
coursed
alone
being
capable
of
supporting
so
large
a
number
of
animals
no
time
was
lost
in
hunting
for
game
the
poorest
of
the
mules
and
horses
were
killed
for
provisions
and
the
diet
was
improved
by
a
little
venison
when
a
deer
casually
presented
itself
near
the
camping
ground
of
indians
they
had
seen
not
one
but
they
now
approached
the
country
of
the
diggers
who
infest
the
district
through
which
the
spanish
trail
passes
laying
contributions
on
the
caravans
of
traders
and
who
have
been
not
inaptly
termed
the
arabs
of
the
american
the
californian
guide
now
earnestly
entreated
permission
to
retrace
his
steps
saying
that
he
should
lose
his
life
if
he
attempted
to
pass
the
digger
country
alone
on
his
return
he
pointed
to
a
peak
at
the
foot
of
which
the
trail
passed
and
leave
being
accorded
he
turned
his
horse
head
towards
the
mission
of
san
fernando
although
the
cavallada
travelled
by
this
time
with
much
less
confusion
than
at
first
still
from
the
want
of
a
track
to
follow
great
trouble
and
exertion
were
required
to
keep
the
proper
direction
the
led
the
van
carrying
walker
who
was
better
acquainted
with
the
country
than
the
others
another
hunter
of
considerable
distinction
in
the
band
on
a
large
mule
rode
by
his
side
then
followed
the
cavallada
jumping
and
frisking
with
each
other
stopping
whenever
a
blade
of
grass
showed
and
constantly
endeavouring
to
break
away
to
green
patches
which
sometimes
presented
themselves
in
the
plains
behind
the
troop
urging
them
on
by
dint
of
loud
cries
and
objurgations
rode
six
mountaineers
keeping
as
much
as
possible
in
a
line
two
others
were
on
each
flank
to
repress
all
attempts
to
wander
and
keep
the
herd
in
a
compact
body
in
this
order
the
caravan
had
been
crossing
a
broken
country
up
and
down
ridges
all
day
the
animals
giving
infinite
trouble
to
their
drivers
when
a
loud
shout
from
the
advanced
guard
put
them
all
upon
the
old
walker
was
seen
to
brandish
the
rifle
over
his
head
and
point
before
him
and
presently
the
cry
of
the
trail
the
trail
gladdened
all
hearts
with
the
anticipation
of
a
respite
from
the
harassing
labour
of
descending
a
broken
ridge
they
at
once
struck
into
a
distinct
and
tolerably
track
into
which
the
cavallada
turned
as
easily
and
instinctively
as
if
they
had
all
their
lives
been
accustomed
to
travel
on
beaten
roads
along
this
they
travelled
delight
being
however
alloyed
by
frequent
indications
that
hunger
and
thirst
had
done
their
work
on
the
mules
and
horses
of
the
caravans
which
had
preceded
them
on
the
trail
they
happened
to
strike
it
in
the
centre
of
a
long
stretch
of
desert
extending
sixty
miles
without
either
water
or
pasture
and
many
animals
had
perished
here
leaving
their
bones
to
bleach
upon
the
plain
the
soil
was
sandy
but
rocks
and
stones
covered
the
surface
disabling
the
feet
of
many
of
the
young
horses
and
mules
several
of
which
at
this
early
stage
of
the
journey
were
already
abandoned
traces
of
the
wretched
diggers
became
very
frequent
these
abject
creatures
resorting
to
the
sandy
plains
for
the
purpose
of
feeding
upon
the
lizards
which
there
abound
as
yet
they
did
not
show
only
at
night
they
prowled
around
the
camp
waiting
a
favourable
opportunity
to
run
the
animals
in
the
present
instance
however
many
of
the
horses
having
been
left
on
the
road
the
diggers
found
so
plentiful
a
supply
of
meat
as
to
render
unnecessary
any
attack
upon
the
formidable
mountaineers
one
evening
the
americans
had
encamped
earlier
than
usual
on
a
creek
with
willow
and
and
affording
tolerable
pasture
and
although
it
was
still
rather
early
they
determined
to
stop
here
and
give
the
animals
an
opportunity
to
fill
themselves
several
deer
had
jumped
out
of
the
bottom
as
they
entered
it
and
la
bonté
and
killbuck
had
sallied
from
the
camp
with
their
rifles
to
hunt
and
endeavour
to
procure
some
venison
for
supper
along
the
river
banks
herds
of
deer
were
feeding
in
every
direction
within
shot
of
the
belt
of
timber
and
the
two
hunters
had
no
difficulty
in
approaching
and
knocking
over
two
fine
bucks
within
a
few
paces
of
the
thicket
they
were
engaged
in
butchering
the
animals
when
la
bonté
looking
up
from
his
work
saw
indians
dodging
among
the
trees
within
a
few
yards
of
himself
and
killbuck
at
the
same
instant
two
arrows
into
the
carcass
of
the
deer
over
which
he
knelt
passing
but
a
few
inches
from
his
head
hollowing
to
his
companion
la
bonté
immediately
seized
the
deer
and
lifting
it
with
main
strength
held
it
as
a
shield
before
him
but
not
before
an
arrow
had
struck
him
in
the
shoulder
rising
from
the
ground
he
retreated
behind
cover
yelling
loudly
to
alarm
the
camp
which
was
not
five
hundred
yards
distant
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
killbuck
when
apprised
of
the
danger
ran
bodily
into
the
plain
and
keeping
out
of
shot
of
the
timber
joined
la
bonté
who
now
out
of
threw
down
his
shield
of
venison
and
fired
his
rifle
at
the
assailants
the
indians
appeared
at
first
afraid
to
leave
the
cover
but
three
or
four
more
joining
them
one
a
chief
they
advanced
into
the
plain
with
drawn
bows
scattering
wide
apart
and
running
swiftly
towards
the
whites
in
a
zigzag
course
in
order
not
to
present
a
steady
mark
to
their
unerring
rifles
the
latter
were
too
cautious
to
discharge
their
pieces
but
kept
a
steady
front
with
rifle
at
shoulder
the
indians
evidently
disliked
to
approach
nearer
but
the
chief
an
old
grizzled
man
incited
them
by
word
and
in
advance
and
calling
upon
the
others
to
follow
him
ho
boy
exclaimed
killbuck
to
his
companion
that
old
coon
must
go
under
or
we
get
rubbed
out
by
these
darned
la
bonté
understood
him
squatting
on
the
ground
he
planted
his
firmly
at
the
extent
of
his
left
arm
and
resting
the
long
barrel
of
his
rifle
on
his
left
hand
which
was
supported
by
the
stick
he
took
a
steady
aim
and
fired
the
indian
throwing
out
his
arms
staggered
and
let
fall
his
hard
to
recover
himself
and
then
fell
forward
on
his
face
the
others
seeing
the
death
of
their
chief
turned
and
made
again
for
the
cover
you
darned
critturs
roared
killbuck
take
that
and
fired
his
rifle
at
the
last
one
tumbling
him
over
as
dead
as
a
stone
the
camp
had
also
been
alarmed
five
of
them
waded
across
the
creek
and
took
the
indians
in
rear
their
rifles
cracked
within
the
timber
several
more
indians
fell
and
the
rest
quickly
beat
a
retreat
the
venison
however
was
not
forgotten
the
two
deer
were
packed
into
camp
and
did
the
duty
of
that
night
this
lesson
had
a
seasonable
effect
upon
the
diggers
who
made
no
attempt
on
the
cavallada
that
night
or
the
next
for
the
camp
remained
two
days
to
recruit
the
animals
we
will
not
follow
the
party
through
all
the
difficulties
and
perils
of
the
desert
route
nor
detail
the
various
devilries
of
the
diggers
who
constantly
sought
opportunities
to
stampede
the
animals
or
approaching
them
in
the
night
as
they
grazed
fired
their
arrows
indiscriminately
at
the
herd
trusting
that
dead
or
disabled
ones
would
be
left
behind
and
afford
them
a
good
supply
of
meat
in
the
month
of
december
the
mountaineers
crossed
the
great
dividing
ridge
of
the
rocky
mountains
making
their
way
through
the
snowy
barrier
with
the
utmost
difficulty
and
losing
many
mules
and
horses
in
the
attempt
on
passing
the
ridge
they
at
once
struck
the
of
the
arkansa
river
and
turned
into
the
bayou
salade
here
they
found
a
village
of
arapahos
and
were
in
no
little
fear
of
leaving
their
cavallada
with
these
dexterous
fortunately
the
chief
in
command
was
friendly
to
the
whites
and
restrained
his
young
men
and
a
present
of
three
horses
insured
his
good
offices
still
the
near
neighbourhood
of
these
indians
being
hardly
desirable
after
a
few
days
halt
the
americans
were
again
on
their
way
and
halted
finally
at
the
juncture
of
the
with
the
arkansa
where
they
determined
to
construct
a
winter
camp
they
now
considered
themselves
at
home
and
at
once
set
about
building
a
capable
of
containing
them
all
and
a
large
corral
for
securing
the
animals
at
night
or
in
case
of
indian
alarms
this
they
effected
by
felling
several
large
cottonwoods
and
throwing
them
in
the
form
of
a
the
entrance
however
being
narrower
than
in
that
figure
and
secured
by
upright
logs
between
which
poles
were
fixed
to
be
withdrawn
at
pleasure
the
house
or
fort
any
thing
in
the
shape
of
a
house
is
called
in
these
parts
where
indeed
every
man
must
make
his
house
a
loopholed
on
all
sides
and
boasted
a
turf
chimney
of
rather
primitive
construction
but
which
answered
the
purpose
of
drawing
the
smoke
from
the
interior
game
was
plentiful
all
around
of
buffalo
were
constantly
passing
the
arkansa
and
there
were
always
deer
and
antelope
within
sight
of
the
fort
the
pasture
too
was
good
and
the
rich
grama
or
buffalo
grass
which
although
rather
dry
at
this
season
still
retains
its
fattening
qualities
and
the
animals
soon
began
to
improve
wonderfully
in
condition
and
strength
of
the
four
hundred
head
of
mules
and
horses
with
which
they
had
started
from
california
but
reached
the
arkansa
many
had
been
killed
for
food
indeed
they
had
furnished
the
only
provisions
during
the
journey
many
had
been
stolen
by
the
indians
or
shot
by
them
at
night
and
many
had
strayed
off
and
not
been
recovered
we
have
omitted
to
mention
that
the
sonora
girl
juanita
and
her
spouse
ned
wooton
remained
behind
at
roubideau
fort
and
rendezvous
on
the
uintah
which
our
band
had
passed
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
whence
they
proceeded
with
a
party
to
taos
in
new
mexico
and
resided
there
for
some
years
blessed
with
a
fine
family
as
the
novels
end
as
soon
as
the
animals
were
fat
and
strong
they
were
taken
down
the
arkansa
to
bent
indian
trading
fort
about
sixty
miles
below
the
mouth
of
here
a
ready
sale
was
found
for
them
mules
being
at
that
time
in
great
demand
on
the
frontier
of
the
united
states
and
every
season
the
bents
carried
across
the
plains
to
independence
a
considerable
number
collected
in
the
indian
country
and
in
the
upper
settlements
of
new
mexico
while
the
mountaineers
were
descending
the
arkansa
a
little
incident
occurred
and
some
of
the
party
very
unexpectedly
encountered
an
old
friend
killbuck
and
la
bonté
who
were
generally
compañeros
were
riding
some
distance
ahead
of
the
cavallada
passing
at
the
time
the
mouth
of
the
huerfano
or
orphan
creek
when
at
a
long
distance
before
them
they
saw
the
figure
of
a
horseman
followed
by
two
loose
animals
descending
the
bluff
into
the
timbered
bottom
of
the
river
judging
the
stranger
to
be
indian
they
spurred
their
horses
and
galloped
in
pursuit
but
the
figure
ahead
suddenly
disappeared
however
they
quickly
followed
the
track
which
was
plain
enough
in
the
sandy
bottom
that
of
a
horse
and
two
mules
killbuck
scrutinised
the
sign
and
puzzled
over
it
a
considerable
time
and
at
last
wagh
this
sign
as
plain
as
mon
beaver
to
me
look
at
that
boy
did
ye
ever
see
that
afore
i
have
answered
la
bonté
peering
down
at
it
that
ar
seems
handy
to
me
now
i
the
man
as
used
to
ride
that
hos
is
long
gone
under
but
the
hos
darn
the
old
crittur
is
old
bill
williams
i
swar
by
well
it
aint
nothin
else
continued
la
bonté
satisfying
himself
by
a
long
look
it
the
old
boy
hos
as
shure
as
shootin
and
them
rapahos
has
rubbed
him
out
at
last
and
raised
his
animals
ho
boy
let
lift
their
agreed
answered
killbuck
and
away
they
started
in
pursuit
determined
to
avenge
the
death
of
their
old
comrade
they
followed
the
track
through
the
bottom
and
into
the
stream
which
it
crossed
and
passing
a
few
yards
up
the
bank
entered
the
water
again
when
they
could
see
nothing
more
of
it
puzzled
at
this
they
sought
on
each
side
the
river
but
in
vain
and
not
wishing
to
lose
more
time
in
the
search
they
proceeded
through
the
timber
on
the
banks
to
find
a
good
for
the
night
which
had
been
their
object
in
riding
in
advance
of
the
cavallada
on
the
left
bank
a
short
distance
before
them
was
a
heavy
growth
of
timber
and
the
river
ran
in
one
place
close
to
a
high
bluff
between
which
and
the
water
was
an
almost
impervious
thicket
of
plum
and
cherry
trees
the
grove
of
timber
ended
before
it
reached
this
point
and
but
few
scattered
trees
grew
in
the
little
glade
which
intervened
and
which
was
covered
with
tolerable
grass
this
being
fixed
upon
as
an
excellent
camp
the
two
mountaineers
rode
into
the
glade
and
dismounted
close
to
the
plum
and
cherry
thicket
which
formed
almost
a
wall
before
them
and
an
excellent
shelter
from
the
wind
jumping
off
their
horses
they
were
in
the
act
of
removing
the
saddles
from
their
backs
when
a
shrill
neigh
burst
from
the
thicket
not
two
yards
behind
them
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
followed
and
presently
a
man
dressed
in
buckskin
and
rifle
in
hand
burst
out
of
the
tangled
brush
exclaiming
in
an
angry
now
i
was
nigh
upon
some
of

thought
was
darned
rapahos
i
did
and
câched

cried
both
the
hunters
give
us
your

them
boys
as
was
rubbed
out
on
lodge
pole
creek
a
time
ago
hyar
if
this
aint
now
i
say
leaving
old
bill
williams
and
our
two
friends
to
exchange
their
rough
but
hearty
greetings
we
will
glance
at
that
old
worthy
history
since
the
time
when
we
left
him
caching
in
the
fire
and
smoke
on
the
indian
in
the
rocky
mountains
he
had
escaped
fire
and
smoke
or
he
would
not
have
been
here
on
arkansa
with
his
old
grizzled
steed
on
that
occasion
the
veteran
mountaineer
had
lost
his
two
and
all
his
beaver
he
was
not
the
man
however
to
want
a
horse
or
mule
as
long
as
an
indian
village
was
near
at
hand
skulking
therefore
by
day
in
cañons
and
deep
gorges
of
the
mountains
and
travelling
by
night
he
followed
closely
on
the
trail
of
the
victorious
savages
bided
his
time
struck
his
coup
and
recovered
a
pair
of
which
was
all
he
required
ever
since
he
had
been
trapping
alone
in
all
parts
of
the
mountains
had
visited
the
rendezvous
but
twice
for
short
periods
and
then
with
full
packs
of
beaver
and
was
now
on
his
way
to
bent
fort
to
dispose
of
his
present
loads
of
peltry
enjoy
one
good
carouse
on
taos
whisky
and
then
return
to
some
hole
or
corner
in
the
mountains
which
he
knew
of
to
follow
in
the
spring
his
solitary
avocation
he
too
had
had
his
share
of
troubles
and
had
many
indian
scrapes
but
passed
safely
through
all
and
scarcely
cared
to
talk
of
what
he
had
done
so
to
him
were
the
most
extraordinary
of
his
perilous
adventures
arrived
at
bent
fort
the
party
disposed
of
their
cavallada
and
for
the
pardonable
weaknesses
of
our
mountain
friends
prompts
us
to
draw
a
veil
over
the
furious
orgies
that
ensued
a
number
of
hunters
and
trappers
were
in
from
their
and
a
village
of
shians
and
some
lodges
of
kioways
were
camped
round
the
fort
as
long
as
the
liquor
lasted
and
there
was
good
store
of
alcohol
as
well
as
of
taos
whisky
the
arkansa
resounded
with
furious
unmixed
with
graver
scenes
for
your
mountaineer
ever
quarrelsome
in
his
cups
is
quick
to
give
and
take
offence
when
rifles
alone
can
settle
the
difference
and
much
blood
is
spilt
upon
the
prairie
in
his
wild
and
frequent
quarrels
bent

is
situated
on
the
left
or
northern
bank
of
the
river

about
one
hundred
miles
from

foot
of

low
and
level
bluff
of
the

which
here
slopes
gradually
to

built
entirely
of
the
form
of
a
hollow
square
at
two
corners
of
which
are
circular
flanking
towers
of

the

is
by
a
large
gateway
into
the
square
round
which
are
the
rooms
occupied
by
the
traders
and
employés
of
the
host
these
are
small
in
size
with
walls
coloured
by
a
made
of
clay
found
in
the
prairie
their
flat
roofs
are
defended
along
the
exterior
by
parapets
of
adobe
to
serve
as
a
cover
to
marksmen
firing
from

and
along
the
coping
grow
plants
of
cactus
of
all
the
varieties
common
in
the
plains
in
the
centre
of
the

is
the
press
for
packing
the

and
there
are
three
large
rooms
one
used
as
a
store
and
magazine
another
as
a
where
the

assemble
for
their
talks

now
the

complains
of
certain
grave
offences
against

a

from

the

has
been
in
his
village
and
before
the

was
opened
in
laying
the
customary
chief
gift
on
the
prairie
has
not
opened
his
hand
but
squeezed
out
his
present
between
his
fingers
grudgingly
and
with
too
sparing
measure
this
was
hard
to
bear
but
the
yellow
wolf
would
say
no
more
or
he
who
jumps
is
deputed
from
the
kioway
to
warn
the
white
traders
not
to
proceed
to
the

to
trade
with
the

that
nation
is
heap
mad
with
the
whites
and
has
dug
up
the
hatchet
to
rub
out
all
who
enter
its

the

loves
the

and
gives
him
warning

something

again
we
must
take
a

with

bedaub

to

utterly
despising
their

cowardly

who
hold
what
little
they

superior
to
themselves
certainly
no

held
his

with
any
mountaineer
who
ever
set
a
trap
in
sight
of

though
a
mexican
despised
his
people
and
abjured
his
blood

his
life
in
the
mountains
with
the

down
easily
upon
six
feet
and

hanging
from

was
not
lost
in
the
crowd
the
last
in
height
but
the
first
in
every
quality
which
constitutes
excellence
in
a
mountaineer
whether
of
indomitable
courage
or
perfect
indifference
to
death
or
danger
with
an
iron
frame
capable
of
withstanding
hunger
thirst
heat
cold
fatigue
and
hardships
of
every
kind
of
wonderful
presence
of

and
endless
resources

instinct
of

of

paragon
of

small
in
stature
and
slenderly
limbed
but
with
muscles
of
wire
with
a
fair
complexion
and
quiet
intelligent
features
to
look
at
kit
none
would
suppose
that
the
being
before
him
was
an
incarnate
devil
in
indian
fight
and
had
raised
more
hair
from
head
of
redskins
than
any
two
men
in
the
western
country
and
yet
thirty
winters
had
scarcely
planted
a
line
or
furrow
on
his
face
no

birth
on
huerfano
or
orphan
creek
so
called
from
an
isolated
which
stands
on
a
prairie
near
the
stream
our
party
fell
in
with
a
village
of
yuta
indians
at
that
time
hostile
to
the
whites
both
parties
were
preparing
for
battle
when
killbuck
who
spoke
the
language
went
forward
with
signs
of
peace
and
after
a
talk
with
several
chiefs
entered
into
an
armistice
each
party
agreeing
not
to
molest
the
other
after
trading
for
a
few
which
the
yutas
are
celebrated
for
dressing
delicately
fine
the
trappers
moved
hastily
on
out
of
such
dangerous
company
and
camped
under
the
mountain
on
oak
creek
where
they
forted
in
a
strong
position
and
constructed
a
corral
in
which
to
secure
their
animals
at
night
at
this
point
is
a
tolerable
pass
through
the
mountains
where
a
break
occurs
in
a
range
whence
they
gradually
decrease
in
magnitude
until
they
meet
the
sierras
of
mexico
which
connect
the
two
mighty
chains
of
the
andes
and
the
rocky
mountains
from
the
summit
of
the
dividing
ridge
to
the
eastward
a
view
is
had
of
the
vast
sea
of
prairie
which
stretches
away
from
the
base
of
the
mountains
in
dreary
barrenness
for
nearly
a
thousand
miles
until
it
meets
the
fertile
valley
of
the
great
missouri
over
this
boundless
expanse
nothing
breaks
the
uninterrupted
solitude
of
the
view
not
a
tree
or
atom
of
foliage
relieves
the
eye
for
the
lines
of
scattered
timber
which
belt
the
streams
running
from
the
mountains
are
lost
in
the
shadow
of
their
stupendous
height
and
beyond
this
nothing
is
seen
but
the
bare
surface
of
the
rolling
prairie
in
no
other
part
of
the
chain
are
the
grand
characteristics
of
the
far
west
more
strikingly
displayed
than
from
this
pass
the
mountains
here
rise
on
the
eastern
side
abruptly
from
the
plain
and
the
view
over
the
great
prairies
is
not
therefore
obstructed
by
intervening
ridges
to
the
westward
the
eye
sweeps
over
the
broken
spurs
which
stretch
from
the
main
range
in
every
direction
whilst
distant
peaks
for
the
most
part
are
seen
at
intervals
rising
isolated
above
the
range
on
all
sides
the
scene
is
wild
and
dismal
crossing
by
this
pass
the
trappers
followed
the
yuta
trail
over
a
plain
skirting
a
ridge
in
which
countless
herds
of
antelope
tame
as
sheep
were
pasturing
numerous
creeks
intersect
it
well
timbered
with
oak
pine
and
cedar
and
well
stocked
with
game
of
all
kinds
on
the
eleventh
day
from
leaving
the
huerfano
they
struck
the
taos
valley
settlement
on
arroyo
hondo
and
pushed
on
at
once
to
the
village
of
but
improperly
called
taos
as
the
dashing
band
clattered
through
the
village
the
dark
eyes
of
the
muchachas
peered
from
the
doors
of
the
adobe
houses
each
mouth
armed
with
cigarito
which
was
at
intervals
removed
to
allow
utterance
to
the
salutation
to
each
hunter
as
he
trotted
past
of
welcome
to
fernandez
and
then
they
hurried
off
to
prepare
for
the
fandango
which
invariably
followed
the
advent
of
the
mountaineers
the
men
however
seemed
scarcely
so
well
pleased
but
leaned
sulkily
against
the
walls
their
sarapes
turned
over
the
left
shoulder
and
concealing
the
lower
part
of
the
face
the
hand
appearing
from
its
upper
folds
only
to
remove
the
eternal
cigarro
from
their
lips
they
from
under
their
sombreros
scowled
with
little
affection
upon
the
stalwart
hunters
who
clattered
past
them
scarcely
deigning
to
glance
at
the
sullen
peládos
but
paying
incomprehensible
compliments
to
the
buxom
wenches
who
smiled
at
them
from
the
doors
thus
exchanging
salutations
they
rode
up
to
the
house
of
an
old
mountaineer
who
had
long
been
settled
here
with
a
new
mexican
wife
and
who
was
the
recognised
entertainer
of
the
hunters
when
they
visited
taos
valley
receiving
in
exchange
such
peltry
as
they
brought
with
them
no
sooner
was
it
known
that
los
americanos
had
arrived
than
nearly
all
the
householders
of
fernandez
presented
themselves
to
offer
the
use
of
their
salas
for
the
fandango
which
invariably
celebrated
their
arrival
this
was
always
a
profitable
event
for
as
the
mountaineers
were
generally
pretty
well
flush
of
cash
when
on
their
spree
and
as
as
an
indian
could
wish
the
sale
of
whisky
with
which
they
regaled
all
comers
produced
a
handsome
return
to
the
fortunate
individual
whose
room
was
selected
for
the
fandango
on
this
occasion
the
sala
of
the
alcalde
don
cornelio
vegil
was
selected
and
put
in
order
a
general
invitation
was
distributed
and
all
the
dusky
beauties
of
fernandez
were
soon
engaged
in
arraying
themselves
for
the
fête
off
came
the
coats
of
dirt
and
alegnía
which
had
bedaubed
their
faces
since
the
last
funcion
leaving
their
cheeks
clear
and
clean
water
was
profusely
used
and
their
cuerpos
were
doubtless
astonished
by
the
unusual
lavation
their
long
black
hair
was
washed
and
combed
plastered
behind
their
ears
and
plaited
into
a
long
queue
which
hung
down
their
backs
of
gaudy
colour
red
most
affected
were
donned
fastened
round
the
waist
with
ornamented
belts
and
above
this
a
of
fine
linen
was
the
only
covering
allowing
a
prodigal
display
of
their
charms
gold
and
silver
ornaments
of
antiquated
pattern
decorate
their
ears
and
necks
and
massive
crosses
of
the
precious
metals
wrought
from
the
gold
or
silver
of
their
own
placeres
hang
pendant
on
their
breasts
the
enagua
or
petticoat
reaching
about
halfway
between
the
knee
and
ancle
displays
their
limbs
destitute
of
stockings
and
their
tiny
feet
thrust
into
quaint
little
shoes
of
cinderellan
dimensions
thus
equipped
with
the
reboso
drawn
over
their
heads
and
faces
out
of
the
folds
of
which
their
brilliant
eyes
flash
like
lightning
and
each
pretty
mouth
armed
with
its
cigarito
they
coquettishly
enter
the
fandango
here
at
one
end
of
a
long
room
are
seated
the
musicians
their
instruments
being
generally
a
species
of
guitar
called
heaca
a
and
an
indian
drum
called
of
each
round
the
room
groups
of
new
mexicans
lounge
wrapped
in
the
eternal
sarape
and
smoking
of
course
scowling
with
jealous
eyes
at
the
more
favoured
mountaineers
these
divested
of
their
of
buckskins
appear
in
their
shirts
of
gaudy
calico
and
close
fitting
buckskin
pantaloons
with
long
fringes
down
the
outside
seam
from
the
hip
to
the
ancle
with
moccasins
ornamented
with
bright
beads
and
porcupine
quills
each
round
his
waist
wears
his
and
ominous
of
the
company
he
is
in
and
some
have
pistols
sticking
in
their
belt
the
the
mark
without
form
or
figure
at
least
those
in
which
the
white
hunters
sport
the
fantastic
seizing
his
partner
round
the
waist
with
the
gripe
of
a
grisly
bear
each
mountaineer
whirls
and
twirls
jumps
and
stamps
introduces
indian
steps
used
in
the
scalp
or
buffalo
dances
whooping
occasionally
with
unearthly
cry
and
then
subsiding
into
the
jerking
step
raising
each
foot
alternately
from
the
ground
so
much
in
vogue
in
indian
ballets
the
hunters
have
the
floor
all
to
themselves
the
mexicans
have
no
chance
in
such
physical
force
dancing
and
if
a
dancing
peládo
steps
into
the
ring
a
thump
from
a
galloping
mountaineer
quickly
sends
him
sprawling
with
the
considerate
quit
you
darned
spaniard
you
ca
in
this
during
a
lull
guagés
filled
with
whisky
go
the
to
and
seldom
refused
by
the
quaffed
by
the
mountaineers
and
freely
swallowed
by
the
peládos
who
drown
their
jealousy
and
envious
hate
of
their
entertainers
in
potent
aguardiente
now
as
the
guagés
are
oft
refilled
and
as
often
drained
and
as
night
advances
so
do
the
spirits
of
the
mountaineers
become
more
boisterous
while
their
attentions
to
their
partners
become
jealousy
of
the
natives
waxes
hotter
they
begin
to
show
symptoms
of
resenting
the
endearments
which
the
mountaineers
bestow
upon
their
wives
and
sweethearts
and
now
when
the
room
is
filled
to
crowding
two
hundred
people
swearing
drinking
dancing
and
americans
monopolising
the
fair
to
the
evident
disadvantage
of
at
least
threescore
scowling
peládos
it
happens
that
one
of
these
maddened
by
whisky
and
the
monster
suddenly
seizes
a
fair
one
from
the
arm
of
a
mountaineer
and
pulls
her
from
her
partner
wagh
is
erect
as
a
pillar
for
a
moment
then
raises
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
gives
a
ringing
upon
the
rash
peládo
seizes
him
by
the
body
as
if
he
were
a
child
lifts
him
over
his
head
and
dashes
him
with
the
force
of
a
giant
against
the
wall
the
war
long
threatened
has
commenced
twenty
mexicans
draw
their
knives
and
rush
upon
la
bonté
who
stands
his
ground
and
sweeps
them
down
with
his
ponderous
fist
one
after
another
as
they
throng
around
him
the
warhoop
bursts
from
the
throats
of
his
companions
and
on
they
rush
to
the
rescue
the
women
scream
and
block
the
door
in
their
eagerness
to
escape
and
thus
the
mexicans
are
compelled
to
stand
their
ground
and
fight
knives
glitter
in
the
light
and
quick
thrusts
are
given
and
parried
in
the
centre
of
the
room
the
whites
stand
shoulder
to
the
floor
with
mexicans
by
their
stalwart
blows
but
the
odds
are
fearful
against
them
and
other
assailants
crowd
up
to
supply
the
place
of
those
who
fall
the
alarm
being
given
by
the
shrieking
women
reinforcements
of
peládos
rushed
to
the
scene
of
action
but
could
not
enter
the
room
which
was
already
full
the
odds
began
to
tell
against
the
mountaineers
when
kit
carson
quick
eye
caught
sight
of
a
high
stool
or
stone
supported
by
three
long
heavy
legs
in
a
moment
he
had
cleared
his
way
to
this
and
in
another
the
three
legs
were
broken
off
and
in
the
hands
of
himself
dick
wooton
and
la
bonté
sweeping
them
round
their
heads
down
came
the
heavy
weapons
amongst
the
mexicans
with
wonderful
blow
dealt
by
the
nervous
arms
of
wooton
and
la
bonté
mowing
down
a
good
of
the
assailants
at
this
the
mountaineers
gave
a
hearty
whoop
and
charged
the
wavering
enemy
with
such
resistless
vigour
that
they
gave
way
and
bolted
through
the
door
leaving
the
floor
strewed
with
wounded
many
most
dangerously
for
as
may
be
imagined
a
thrust
from
the
keen
by
the
nervous
arm
of
a
mountaineer
was
no
baby
blow
and
seldom
failed
to
strike
to
the
green
river
on
the
blade
the
field
being
won
the
whites
too
beat
a
quick
retreat
to
the
house
where
they
were
domiciled
and
where
they
had
left
their
rifles
without
their
trusty
weapons
they
felt
indeed
unarmed
and
not
knowing
how
the
affair
just
over
would
be
followed
up
lost
no
time
in
making
preparations
for
defence
however
after
great
blustering
on
the
part
of
the
prefecto
who
accompanied
by
a
of
greasers
proceeded
to
the
house
and
demanded
the
surrender
of
all
concerned
in
the
proposition
was
received
with
a
yell
of
business
was
compounded
by
the
mountaineers
promising
to
give
sundry
dollars
to
the
friends
of
two
of
the
mexicans
who
died
during
the
night
of
their
wounds
and
to
pay
for
a
certain
amount
of
masses
to
be
sung
for
the
repose
of
their
souls
in
purgatory
thus
the
affair
blew
over
but
for
several
days
the
mountaineers
never
showed
themselves
in
the
streets
of
fernandez
without
their
rifles
on
their
shoulders
and
refrained
from
attending
fandangos
for
the
present
and
until
the
excitement
had
cooled
down
a
bitter
feeling
however
existed
on
the
part
of
the
men
and
one
or
two
offers
of
a
matrimonial
nature
were
rejected
by
the
papas
of
certain
ladies
who
had
been
wooed
by
some
of
the
white
hunters
and
their
hands
formally
demanded
from
the
respective
padres
la
bonté
had
been
rather
smitten
with
the
charms
of
one
dolores
buxom
lass
more
than
three
parts
indian
in
her
blood
but
confessedly
the
beauty
of
the
vale
of
taos
she
by
dint
of
eye
and
of
nameless
acts
of
elaborate
coquetry
with
which
the
sex
so
universally
bait
their
traps
whether
in
the
salons
of
belgravia
or
the
rancherias
of
new
mexico
contrived
to
make
considerable
havoc
in
the
heart
of
our
mountaineer
and
when
once
dolores
saw
she
had
made
an
impression
she
followed
up
her
advantage
with
all
the
arts
the
most
civilised
of
her
sex
could
use
when
fishing
for
a
husband
la
bonté
however
was
too
old
a
hunter
to
be
easily
caught
and
before
committing
himself
he
sought
the
advice
of
his
tried
companion
killbuck
taking
him
to
a
retired
spot
without
the
village
he
drew
out
his
pipe
and
charged
himself
on
the
ground
and
with
indian
gravity
composed
himself
for

began

come
old

and
shouldering
their
rifles
the
two
compañeros
returned
to
the
ranch
more
than
one
of
the
mountaineers
had
fulfilled
the
object
of
their
journey
and
had
taken
to
themselves
a
partner
from
amongst
the
belles
of
taos
and
now
they
were
preparing
for
their
return
to
the
mountains
dick
wooton
was
the
only
unfortunate
one
he
had
wooed
a
damsel
whose
parents
peremptorily
forbade
their
daughter
to
wed
the
hunter
and
he
therefore
made
ready
for
his
departure
with
considerable
regret
the
day
came
however
the
band
of
mountaineers
were
already
mounted
and
those
with
wives
in
charge
were
some
hours
on
the
road
leaving
the
remainder
quaffing
many
a
before
they
left
dick
wooton
was
as
melancholy
as
a
buffalo
bull
in
spring
and
as
he
rode
down
the
village
and
approached
the
house
of
his
who
stood
wrapped
in
reboso
and
cigarito
in
mouth
on
the
sill
of
the
door
he
turned
away
his
head
as
if
dreading
to
say
adios
la
bonté
rode
beside
him
and
a
thought
struck
him
ho
dick
he
said
thar
the
gal
and
thar
the
mountains
shoot
sharp
the
dick
instantly
understood
him
and
was
himself
he
rode
up
to
the
girl
as
if
to
bid
her
adieu
and
she
came
to
meet
him
whispering
one
word
she
put
her
foot
upon
his
was
instantly
seized
round
the
waist
and
placed
upon
the
horn
of
his
saddle
he
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
and
in
a
minute
was
out
of
sight
his
three
companions
covering
his
retreat
and
menacing
with
their
rifles
the
crowd
which
was
soon
drawn
to
the
spot
by
the
cries
of
the
girl
parents
who
had
been
astonished
spectators
of
the
daring
rape
the
trapper
and
his
bride
however
escaped
scatheless
and
the
whole
party
effected
a
safe
passage
of
the
mountains
and
reached
the
arkansa
where
the
band
was
broken
up
proceeding
to
bent
fort
and
others
to
the
platte
amongst
whom
were
killbuck
and
la
bonté
still
in
company
these
two
once
more
betook
themselves
to
trapping
the
yellow
stone
being
their
chief
but
we
must
again
leap
over
months
and
years
rather
than
conduct
the
reader
through
all
their
perilous
wanderings
and
at
last
bring
him
back
to
the
camp
on
bijou
where
we
first
introduced
him
to
our
mountaineers
and
as
we
have
already
followed
them
on
the
arapaho
trail
which
they
pursued
to
recover
their
stolen
animals
from
a
band
of
that
nation
we
will
once
again
seat
ourselves
at
the
camp
on
boiling
spring
where
they
had
met
a
strange
hunter
on
a
solitary
expedition
to
the
bayou
salade
whose
rifle
had
excited
their
wonder
and
curiosity
from
him
they
learned
also
that
a
large
band
of
mormons
were
wintering
on
the
arkansa
to
the
great
salt
lake
and
upper
california
and
as
our
hunters
had
before
fallen
in
with
the
advanced
guard
of
these
fanatic
emigrants
and
felt
no
little
wonder
that
such
helpless
people
should
undertake
so
long
a
journey
through
the
wilderness
the
stranger
narrated
to
them
the
history
of
the
sect
which
we
shall
shortly
transcribe
for
the
benefit
of
the
reader
chapter
ix
the
mormons
were
originally
of
the
sect
known
as
saints
which
sect
flourishes
wherever
gulls
are
found
in
sufficient
numbers
to
swallow
the
egregious
nonsense
of
fanatic
humbugs
who
fatten
upon
their
credulity
in
the
united
states
they
especially
abounded
but
the
creed
becoming
slow
one
joe
smith
a
man
arose
from
its
ranks
and
instilled
a
little
life
into
the
decaying
sect
joe
better
known
as
the
prophet
joe
was
taking
his
siesta
one
fine
day
upon
hill
in
one
of
the
new
england
states
when
an
angel
suddenly
appeared
to
him
and
made
known
the
locality
of
a
new
bible
or
testament
which
contained
the
history
of
the
lost
tribes
of
israel
that
these
tribes
were
no
other
than
the
indian
nations
which
possessed
the
continent
of
america
at
the
time
of
its
discovery
and
the
remains
of
which
still
existed
in
their
savage
state
that
through
the
agency
of
joe
these
were
to
be
reclaimed
collected
into
the
bosom
of
a
church
to
be
there
established
according
to
principles
which
would
be
found
in
the
wonderful
which
church
was
gradually
to
receive
into
its
bosom
all
other
churches
sects
and
persuasions
with
unanimity
of
belief
and
perfect
after
a
certain
probation
joe
was
led
in
body
and
spirit
to
the
mountain
by
the
angel
who
first
appeared
to
him
was
pointed
out
the
position
of
the
wonderful
book
which
was
covered
by
a
flat
stone
on
which
would
be
found
two
round
pebbles
called
urim
and
thummim
and
through
the
agency
of
which
the
mystic
characters
inscribed
on
the
pages
of
the
book
were
to
be
deciphered
and
translated
joe
found
the
spot
indicated
without
any
difficulty
cleared
away
the
earth
and
discovered
a
hollow
place
formed
by
four
flat
stones
on
removing
the
topmost
one
of
which
sundry
plates
of
brass
presented
themselves
covered
with
quaint
and
antique
carving
on
the
top
lay
urim
and
thummim
commonly
known
to
the
mormons
as
mummum
and
thummum
the
pebbles
of
wonderful
virtue
through
which
the
miracle
of
reading
the
plates
of
brass
was
to
be
performed
joe
smith
on
whom
the
mantle
of
moses
had
so
suddenly
fallen
carefully
removed
the
plates
and
hid
them
burying
himself
in
woods
and
mountains
whilst
engaged
in
the
work
of
translation
however
he
made
no
secret
of
the
important
task
imposed
upon
him
nor
of
the
great
work
to
which
he
had
been
called
numbers
at
once
believed
him
but
not
a
few
were
deaf
to
belief
and
openly
derided
him
being
persecuted
as
the
sect
declares
at
the
instigation
of
the
authorities
and
many
attempts
being
made
to
steal
his
precious
treasure
joe
one
fine
night
packed
his
plates
in
a
sack
of
beans
bundled
them
into
a
jersey
waggon
and
made
tracks
for
the
west
here
he
completed
the
great
work
of
translation
and
not
long
after
gave
to
the
world
the
book
of
mormon
a
work
as
bulky
as
the
bible
and
called
of
mormon
for
so
was
the
prophet
named
by
whose
hand
the
history
of
the
lost
tribes
had
been
handed
down
in
the
plates
of
brass
thus
miraculously
preserved
for
thousands
of
years
and
brought
to
light
through
the
agency
of
joseph
smith
the
fame
of
the
book
of
mormon
spread
over
all
america
and
even
to
great
britain
and
ireland
hundreds
of
proselytes
flocked
to
joe
to
hear
from
his
lips
the
doctrine
of
mormonism
and
in
a
very
brief
period
the
mormons
became
a
numerous
and
recognised
sect
and
joe
was
at
once
and
by
universal
acclamation
installed
as
the
head
of
the
mormon
church
and
was
ever
after
known
by
the
name
of
the
prophet
however
from
certain
peculiarities
in
their
social
system
the
mormons
became
rather
unpopular
in
the
settled
states
and
at
length
moved
bodily
into
missouri
where
they
purchased
several
tracts
of
land
in
the
neighbourhood
of
independence
here
they
erected
a
large
building
which
they
called
the
lord
store
where
goods
were
collected
on
the
common
account
and
retailed
to
members
of
the
church
at
moderate
prices
all
this
time
their
numbers
increased
in
a
wonderful
manner
and
immigrants
from
all
parts
of
the
states
as
well
as
europe
continually
joined
them
as
they
became
stronger
they
grew
bolder
and
more
arrogant
in
their
projects
they
had
hitherto
been
considered
as
bad
neighbours
on
account
of
their
pilfering
propensities
and
their
utter
disregard
of
the
conventional
decencies
of
the
greatest
immorality
and
endeavouring
to
establish
amongst
their
society
an
indiscriminate
concubinage
this
was
sufficient
to
produce
an
ill
feeling
against
them
on
the
part
of
their
neighbours
the
honest
missourians
but
they
still
tolerated
their
presence
amongst
them
until
the
saints
openly
proclaimed
their
intention
of
seizing
upon
the
country
and
expelling
by
force
the
present
as
their
reason
that
it
had
been
revealed
to
their
prophets
that
the
land
of
zion
was
to
be
possessed
by
themselves
alone
the
sturdy
missourians
began
to
think
this
was
a
little
too
strong
and
that
if
they
permitted
such
aggressions
any
longer
they
would
be
in
a
fair
way
of
being
despoiled
of
their
lands
by
the
mormon
interlopers
at
length
matters
came
to
a
crisis
and
the
saints
emboldened
by
the
impunity
with
which
they
had
hitherto
carried
out
their
plans
issued
a
proclamation
to
the
effect
that
all
in
that
part
of
the
country
who
did
not
belong
to
the
mormon
persuasion
must
clear
out
and
give
up
possession
of
their
lands
and
houses
the
missourians
collected
in
a
body
burned
the
from
which
the
proclamation
had
emanated
seized
several
of
the
mormon
leaders
and
after
inflicting
a
summary
chastisement
tarred
and
feathered
them
and
let
them
go
to
revenge
this
insult
the
mormons
marshalled
an
army
of
saints
and
marched
upon
independence
threatening
vengeance
against
the
town
and
people
here
they
met
however
a
band
of
sturdy
backwoodsmen
armed
with
rifles
determined
to
defend
the
town
against
the
fanatic
mob
who
not
relishing
their
appearance
refused
the
encounter
and
surrendered
their
leaders
at
the
first
demand
the
prisoners
were
afterwards
released
on
condition
that
the
mormons
left
that
part
of
the
country
without
delay
accordingly
they
once
more
took
up
their
beds
and
walked
crossing
the
missouri
to
clay
county
where
they
established
themselves
and
would
finally
have
formed
a
thriving
settlement
but
for
their
own
acts
of
wilful
dishonesty
at
this
time
their
blasphemous
mummery
knew
no
bounds
joe
smith
and
other
prophets
who
had
lately
arisen
were
declared
to
be
chosen
of
god
and
it
was
the
general
creed
that
on
the
day
of
judgment
the
former
would
take
his
stand
on
the
right
hand
of
the
and
that
none
would
pass
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
without
his
seal
and
touch
one
of
their
tenets
was
the
faith
in
spiritual
no
woman
it
appeared
would
be
admitted
into
heaven
unless
passed
by
a
saint
to
qualify
them
for
this
it
was
necessary
that
the
woman
should
first
be
received
by
the
guaranteeing
mormon
as
an
earthly
wife
in
order
that
he
did
not
pass
in
any
of
whom
he
had
no
knowledge
the
consequence
of
this
state
of
things
may
be
imagined
the
most
debasing
immorality
was
a
precept
of
the
order
and
an
almost
universal
concubinage
existed
amongst
the
sect
which
at
this
time
numbered
at
least
forty
thousand
their
disregard
to
the
laws
of
decency
and
morality
was
such
as
could
not
be
tolerated
in
any
class
of
civilised
society
again
did
the
honest
missourians
set
their
faces
against
this
pernicious
example
and
when
the
county
to
which
the
mormons
had
removed
became
more
thickly
settled
they
rose
to
a
man
against
the
modern
gomorrah
the
mormons
by
this
time
having
on
their
part
gained
considerable
accession
to
their
strength
thought
to
set
the
laws
at
defiance
organised
and
armed
large
bodies
of
men
in
order
to
maintain
the
ascendency
over
the
legitimate
settlers
and
bid
fair
to
constitute
an
imperium
in
imperio
in
the
state
and
become
the
sole
possessors
of
the
public
lands
this
of
course
could
not
be
tolerated
governor
boggs
at
once
ordered
out
a
large
force
of
state
militia
to
put
down
this
formidable
demonstration
marched
against
the
mormons
and
suppressed
the
insurrectionary
movement
without
bloodshed
from
clay
county
they
moved
still
farther
into
the
wilds
and
settled
at
last
in
caldwell
county
where
they
built
the
town
of
far
west
and
here
they
remained
for
the
space
of
three
years
during
this
time
they
were
continually
receiving
converts
to
the
faith
and
many
of
the
more
ignorant
country
people
were
disposed
to
join
them
being
only
deterred
by
the
fear
of
incurring
ridicule
from
the
the
body
of
the
mormons
seeing
this
called
upon
their
prophet
joe
smith
to
perform
a
miracle
in
public
before
all
comers
which
was
to
prove
to
those
of
their
own
people
who
still
doubted
the
doctrine
the
truth
of
what
it
the
power
of
performing
miracles
was
stedfastly
declared
to
be
in
their
hands
by
the
prophets
to
enlist
those
who
wavered
in
the
mormon
cause
the
prophet
instantly
agreed
and
declared
that
upon
a
certain
day
he
would
walk
across
the
broad
waters
of
the
missouri
without
wetting
the
soles
of
his
feet
on
the
appointed
day
the
river
banks
were
thronged
by
an
expectant
crowd
the
mormons
sang
hymns
of
praise
in
honour
of
their
prophet
and
were
proud
of
the
forthcoming
miracle
which
was
to
set
finally
at
rest
all
doubt
as
to
his
power
and
sanctity
this
power
of
performing
miracles
and
effecting
miraculous
cures
of
the
sick
was
so
generally
believed
by
the
mormons
that
physic
was
never
used
amongst
them
the
prophets
visited
the
beds
of
the
sick
and
laid
hands
upon
them
and
if
as
of
course
was
almost
invariably
the
case
the
patient
died
it
was
attributed
to
his
or
her
want
of
faith
but
if
on
the
contrary
the
patient
recovered
there
was
universal
glorification
on
the
miraculous
cure
joe
smith
was
a
tall
man
of
most
plausible
address
and
possessed
the
gift
of
the
gab
in
great
perfection
at
the
time
appointed
for
the
performance
of
the
miracle
he
duly
attended
on
the
river
banks
and
descended
barefoot
to
the
edge
of
the
water
my
brethren
he
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
this
day
is
a
happy
one
to
me
to
us
all
who
venerate
the
great
and
only
faith
the
truth
of
our
great
and
blessed
doctrine
will
now
be
proved
before
the
thousands
i
see
around
me
you
have
asked
me
to
prove
by
a
miracle
that
the
power
of
the
prophets
of
old
has
been
given
to
me
i
say
unto
you
not
only
to
me
but
to
all
who
have
faith
i
have
faith
and
can
perform
faith
empowers
me
to
walk
across
the
broad
surface
of
that
mighty
river
without
wetting
the
soles
of
my
unworthy
feet
but
if
ye
are
to
this
miracle
performed
it
is
necessary
that
ye
have
faith
also
not
only
in
yourselves
but
in
me
have
ye
this
faith
in
yourselves
we
have
we
have
roared
the
crowd
have
ye
the
faith
in
me
that
ye
believe
i
can
perform
this
miracle
we
have
we
have
roared
the
crowd
then
said
joe
smith
coolly
walking
away
with
such
faith
do
ye
know
well
that
i
but
it
boots
not
that
i
do
it
therefore
my
brethren
doubt
no
more
joe
put
on
his
boots
and
disappeared
being
again
compelled
to
emigrate
the
mormons
proceeded
into
the
state
of
illinois
where
in
a
beautiful
situation
they
founded
the
new
jerusalem
which
it
had
been
declared
by
the
prophet
mormon
should
rise
out
of
the
wilderness
of
the
west
and
where
the
chosen
people
should
be
collected
under
one
church
and
governed
by
the
elders
after
a
spiritual
the
city
of
nauvoo
soon
became
a
large
and
imposing
settlement
an
enormous
building
called
the
temple
of
zion
was
erected
half
church
half
hôtel
in
which
joe
smith
and
the
other
prophets
large
storehouses
were
connected
with
it
in
which
the
goods
and
chattels
belonging
to
the
community
were
kept
for
the
common
good
however
here
as
every
where
else
they
were
continually
quarrelling
with
their
neighbours
and
as
their
numbers
increased
so
did
their
audacity
a
regular
mormon
militia
was
again
organised
and
armed
under
the
command
of
experienced
officers
who
had
joined
the
sect
and
now
the
authority
of
the
state
government
was
openly
defied
in
consequence
the
executive
took
measures
to
put
down
the
nuisance
and
a
regular
war
commenced
and
was
carried
on
for
some
time
with
no
little
bloodshed
on
both
sides
and
this
armed
movement
is
known
in
the
united
states
as
the
mormon
war
the
mormons
however
who
it
seemed
were
much
better
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
tongue
than
the
rifle
succumbed
the
city
of
nauvoo
was
taken
joe
smith
and
other
ringleading
prophets
captured
and
the
former
in
an
attempt
to
escape
from
his
place
of
confinement
was
seized
and
shot
the
mormons
declare
he
had
long
foretold
his
own
fate
and
that
when
the
rifles
of
the
firing
party
who
were
his
executioners
were
levelled
at
the
prophet
breast
a
flash
of
lightning
struck
the
weapons
from
their
hands
and
blinded
for
a
time
the
eyes
of
the
sacrilegious
soldiers
with
the
death
of
joe
smith
the
prestige
of
the
mormon
cause
declined
but
still
thousands
of
proselytes
joined
them
annually
and
at
last
the
state
took
measures
to
remove
them
altogether
as
a
body
from
the
country
once
again
they
fled
as
they
themselves
term
it
before
the
persecutions
of
the
ungodly
but
this
time
their
migration
was
far
beyond
the
reach
of
their
enemies
and
their
intention
was
to
place
between
them
the
impassable
barrier
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
to
seek
a
home
and
in
the
remote
regions
of
the
far
west
this
the
most
extraordinary
migration
of
modern
times
commenced
in
the
year
but
it
was
not
till
the
following
year
that
the
great
body
of
the
mormons
turned
their
backs
upon
the
settlements
of
the
united
states
and
launched
boldly
out
into
the
vast
and
barren
prairies
without
any
fixed
destination
as
a
goal
to
their
endless
journey
for
many
months
long
strings
of
pittsburg
and
conostaga
waggons
with
herds
of
horses
and
domestic
cattle
wound
their
way
towards
the
indian
frontier
with
the
intention
of
rendezvousing
at
council
bluffs
on
the
upper
missouri
here
thousands
of
waggons
were
congregated
with
their
tens
of
thousands
of
men
women
and
children
anxiously
waiting
the
route
from
the
elders
of
the
church
who
on
their
parts
scarcely
knew
whither
to
direct
the
steps
of
the
vast
crowd
they
had
set
in
motion
at
length
the
indefinite
destination
of
oregon
and
california
was
proclaimed
and
the
long
train
of
emigrants
took
up
the
line
of
march
it
was
believed
the
indian
tribes
would
immediately
fraternise
with
the
mormons
on
their
approaching
their
country
but
the
pawnees
quickly
undeceived
them
by
running
off
with
their
stock
on
every
opportunity
besides
these
losses
at
every
camp
horses
sheep
and
oxen
strayed
away
and
were
not
recovered
and
numbers
died
from
fatigue
and
want
of
provender
so
that
before
they
had
been
many
weeks
on
their
journey
nearly
all
their
cattle
which
they
had
brought
to
stock
their
new
country
were
dead
or
missing
and
those
that
were
left
were
in
most
miserable
condition
they
had
started
so
late
in
the
season
that
the
greater
part
were
compelled
to
winter
on
the
platte
on
grand
island
and
in
the
vicinity
where
they
endured
the
greatest
privations
and
suffering
from
cold
and
hunger
many
who
had
lost
their
stock
lived
upon
roots
and
and
scurvy
in
a
most
malignant
form
and
other
disorders
carried
off
numbers
of
the
wretched
fanatics
amongst
them
were
many
substantial
farmers
from
all
parts
of
the
united
states
who
had
given
up
their
valuable
farms
sold
off
all
their
property
and
were
dragging
their
irresponsible
and
unfortunate
families
into
the
away
by
their
blind
and
fanatic
zeal
in
this
absurd
and
incredible
faith
there
were
also
many
poor
wretches
from
different
parts
of
england
mostly
of
the
class
with
wives
and
families
crawling
along
with
helpless
and
almost
idiotic
despair
but
urged
forward
by
the
fanatic
leaders
of
the
movement
who
promised
them
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
to
reward
them
for
all
their
hardships
and
privations
their
numbers
were
soon
reduced
by
want
and
disease
when
too
late
they
often
wished
themselves
back
in
the
old
country
and
sighed
many
a
time
for
the
beer
and
bacon
of
former
days
now
preferable
to
the
dry
buffalo
meat
but
seldom
obtainable
of
the
far
west
evil
fortune
pursued
the
mormons
and
dogged
their
steps
the
year
following
some
struggled
on
towards
the
promised
land
and
of
these
a
few
reached
oregon
and
california
many
were
killed
by
hostile
indians
many
perished
of
hunger
cold
and
thirst
in
passing
the
great
wilderness
and
many
returned
to
the
states
penniless
and
crestfallen
and
heartily
cursing
the
moment
in
which
they
had
listened
to
the
counsels
of
the
mormon
prophet
the
numbers
who
reached
their
destination
of
oregon
california
and
the
great
salt
lake
are
computed
at
of
whom
the
united
states
had
an
unregretted
riddance
one
party
had
followed
the
troops
of
the
american
government
intended
for
the
conquest
of
new
mexico
and
the
californias
of
these
a
battalion
was
formed
and
part
of
it
proceeded
to
upper
california
but
the
way
being
impracticable
for
waggons
some
seventy
families
proceeded
up
the
arkansa
and
wintered
near
the
mountains
intending
to
cross
to
the
platte
the
ensuing
spring
and
join
the
main
body
of
emigrants
on
their
way
by
the
south
pass
of
the
rocky
mountains
in
the
wide
and
bottom
of
the
arkansa
the
mormons
had
erected
a
street
of
log
shanties
in
which
to
pass
the
inclement
winter
these
were
built
of
rough
logs
of
cottonwood
laid
one
above
the
other
the
interstices
filled
with
mud
and
rendered
impervious
to
wind
or
wet
at
one
end
of
the
row
of
shanties
was
built
the
church
or
long
building
of
huge
logs
in
which
the
and
took
place
the
band
wintering
on
the
arkansa
were
a
far
better
class
than
the
generality
of
mormons
and
comprised
many
wealthy
and
respectable
farmers
from
the
western
states
most
of
whom
were
accustomed
to
the
life
of
woodmen
and
were
good
hunters
thus
they
were
enabled
to
support
their
families
upon
the
produce
of
their
rifles
frequently
sallying
out
to
the
nearest
point
of
the
mountains
with
a
waggon
which
they
would
bring
back
loaded
with
buffalo
deer
and
elk
meat
thereby
saving
the
necessity
of
killing
any
of
their
stock
of
cattle
of
which
but
few
remained
the
mountain
hunters
found
this
camp
a
profitable
market
for
their
meat
and
with
which
the
mormons
were
now
compelled
to
clothe
themselves
and
resorted
there
for
that
say
nothing
of
the
attraction
of
the
many
really
beautiful
missourian
girls
who
sported
their
tall
graceful
figures
at
the
frequent
fandangoes
dancing
and
preaching
go
hand
in
hand
in
mormon
doctrine
and
the
temple
was
generally
cleared
for
a
hop
two
or
three
times
during
the
week
a
couple
of
fiddles
doing
the
duty
of
orchestra
a
party
of
mountaineers
came
in
one
day
bringing
some
buffalo
meat
and
dressed
and
were
invited
to
be
present
at
one
of
these
festivals
arrived
at
the
temple
they
were
rather
taken
aback
by
finding
themselves
in
for
a
sermon
which
one
of
the
elders
delivered
preparatory
to
the
physical
the
preacher
was
one
by
reason
of
his
commanding
a
company
of
mormon
volunteers
brown
man
of
correctly
got
up
in
black
continuations
and
white
handkerchief
round
his
neck
a
costume
seldom
seen
at
the
foot
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
rising
cleared
his
voice
and
thus
commenced
first
turning
to
an
elder
with
whom
there
was
a
little
rivalry
in
the
way
of
preaching
brother
dowdle
brother
dowdle
blushed
and
nodded
he
was
a
long
man

hair

in
a
hoarse
low
voice
i
out
and
think
we
better
begin
the
exercises
grettful
to
the
brother
dowdle
rose
and
after
saying
that
he
did
feel
like
saying
much
begged
to
remind
all
hands
that
dancing
was
solemn
like
to
be
done
with
proper
devotion
and
not
with
laughing
and
talking
of
which
he
hoped
to
hear
little
or
none
that
joy
was
to
be
in
their
hearts
and
not
on
their
lips
that
they
danced
for
the
glory
of
the
lord
and
not
their
own
amusement
as
did
the
after
saying
thus
he
called
upon
brother

strike
up
sundry
couples

forth
and
the
ball
commenced

missourian

a
pair
of
homespun
pantaloons
thrust
into
the
legs
of
his
heavy
boots
nodding
his
head
in
time
with
the
music
he
occasionally
gave
instructions
to
such
of
the
dancers
as
were
at
fault

them
to
the
tune

with
comical

a
mountaineer
rube
herring
whom
we
have
more
than
once
met
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
became
a
convert
to
the
mormon
creed
and
held
forth
its
wonderful
doctrines
to
such
of
the
incredulous
trappers
as
he
could
induce
to
listen
to
him
old
rube
stood
nearly
six
feet
six
in
height
and
was
spare
and
bony
in
make
he
had
picked
up
a
most
extraordinary
cloth
coat
amongst
the
mormons
which
had
belonged
to
some
one
his
equal
in
stature
this
coat
which
was
of
a
colour
had
its
waist
about
a
hand
span
from
the
nape
of
rube

or
about
a
yard
above
its
proper
position
and

with

and
reached
midway
between
his

his
huge

were
encased
in
moccasins
of
skin
rube
was
never
without
the
book
of
mormon
in
his
hand
and
his
sonorous
voice
might
be
heard
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
reading
passages
from
its
wonderful
pages
he
stood
the
badgering
of
the
hunters
with
most
perfect
good
humour
and
said
there
never
was
such
a
book
as
that
ever
before
printed
that
the
mormons
were
the
biggest
kind
of
prophets
and
theirs
the
best
faith
ever
man
believed
in
rube
had
let
out
one
day
that
he
was
to
be
hired
as
guide
by
this
party
of
mormons
to
the
great
salt
lake
but
their
destination
being
changed
and
his
services
not
required
a
wonderful
change
came
over
his
mind
he
was
as
usual
book
of
mormon
in
hand
when
brother
brown
announced
the
change
in
their
plans
at
which
the
book
was
cast
into
the
arkansa
and
rube
cuss
your
darned
mummum
and
thummum
thar
not
one
among
you
knows
cow
from
bull
and
you
may
go
for
and
turning
away
old
rube
spat
out
a
quid
of
tobacco
and
his
mormonism
together
amongst
the
mormons
was
an
old
man
named
brand
from
memphis
county
state
of
tennessee
with
a
family
of
a
daughter
and
two
sons
the
latter
with
their
wives
and
children
brand
was
a
wiry
old
fellow
nearly
seventy
years
of
age
but
still
stout
and
strong
and
wielded
axe
or
rifle
better
than
many
a
younger
man
if
truth
be
told
he
was
not
a
very
mormon
and
had
joined
them
as
much
for
the
sake
of
company
to
california
whither
he
had
long
resolved
to
emigrate
as
from
any
implicit
credence
in
the
faith
his
sons
were
strapping
fellows
of
the
sterling
stuff
that
the
western
pioneers
are
made
of
his
daughter
mary
a
fine
woman
of
thirty
for
whose
state
of
single
blessedness
there
must
doubtless
have
been
sufficient
reason
for
she
was
not
only
remarkably
handsome
but
was
well
known
in
memphis
to
be
the
and
most
industrious
young
woman
in
those
diggings
she
was
known
to
have
received
several
advantageous
offers
all
of
which
she
had
refused
and
report
said
that
it
was
from
having
been
disappointed
in
very
early
life
in
an
du
at
an
age
when
such
wounds
sometimes
strike
strong
and
deep
leaving
a
scar
difficult
to
heal
neither
his
daughter
nor
any
of
his
family
had
been
converted
to
the
mormon
doctrine
but
had
ever
kept
themselves
aloof
and
refused
to
join
or
associate
with
them
and
for
this
reason
the
family
had
been
very
unpopular
with
the
mormon
families
on
the
arkansa
and
hence
probably
one
great
reason
why
they
now
started
alone
on
their
journey
spring
had
arrived
and
it
was
time
the
mormons
should
proceed
on
their
march
but
whether
already
tired
of
the
sample
they
had
had
of
life
in
the
wilderness
or
fearful
of
encountering
the
perils
of
the
indian
country
not
one
amongst
them
with
the
exception
of
old
brand
seemed
inclined
to
pursue
the
journey
farther
that
old
backwoodsman
however
was
not
to
be
deterred
but
declared
his
intention
of
setting
out
alone
with
his
family
and
risking
all
the
dangers
to
be
anticipated
one
fine
sunny
evening
in
april
of
when
the
cottonwoods
on
the
banks
of
the
arkansa
began
to
put
forth
their
buds
and
robins
and
of
hopping
with
gaudy
plumage
through
the
thickets
three
conostoga
waggons
emerged
from
the
timbered
bottom
of
the
river
and
rumbled
slowly
over
the
prairie
in
the
direction
of
the
platte
waters
each
waggon
was
drawn
by
eight
oxen
and
contained
a
portion
of
the
farming
implements
and
household
utensils
of
the
brand
family
the
teams
were
driven
by
the
young
boys
the
men
following
in
rear
with
shouldered
brand
himself
mounted
on
an
indian
horse
leading
the
advance
the
women
were
safely
housed
under
the
shelter
of
the
waggon
tilts
and
out
of
the
first
the
mild
face
of
mary
brand
smiled
adieu
to
many
of
her
old
companions
who
had
accompanied
them
thus
far
and
now
wished
them
on
their
long
journey
some
mountaineers
too
galloped
up
dressed
in
buckskin
and
gave
them
rough
the
men
to
keep
their
eyes
skinned
and
look
out
for
the
arapahos
who
were
out
on
the
waters
of
the
platte
presently
all
retired
and
then
the
huge
waggons
and
the
little
company
were
rolling
on
their
solitary
way
through
the
deserted
the
first
of
the
many
thousand
miles
which
lay
between
them
and
the
setting
sun
as
the
indians
style
the
distant
regions
of
the
far
west
and
on
without
casting
a
look
behind
him
doggedly
and
boldly
marched
old
brand
followed
by
his
sturdy
family
they
made
but
a
few
miles
that
evening
for
the
first
day
the
is
all
that
is
effected
and
nearly
the
whole
morning
is
taken
up
in
getting
fairly
under
weigh
the
loose
stock
had
been
sent
off
earlier
for
they
had
been
collected
and
corralled
the
previous
night
and
after
a
twelve
hours
fast
it
was
necessary
they
should
reach
the
end
of
the
day
journey
betimes
they
found
the
herd
grazing
in
the
bottom
of
the
arkansa
at
a
point
previously
fixed
upon
for
their
first
camp
here
the
oxen
were
unyoked
and
the
waggons
drawn
up
so
as
to
form
the
three
sides
of
a
small
square
the
women
then
descended
from
their
seats
and
prepared
the
evening
meal
a
huge
fire
was
kindled
before
the
waggons
and
round
this
the
whole
party
collected
whilst
large
kettles
of
coffee
boiled
on
it
and
baked
upon
the
embers
the
women
were
sadly
downhearted
as
well
they
might
be
with
the
dreary
prospect
before
them
and
poor
mary
when
she
saw
the
mormon
encampment
shut
out
from
her
sight
by
the
rolling
bluffs
and
nothing
before
her
but
the
bleak
barren
prairie
could
not
divest
herself
of
the
idea
that
she
had
looked
for
the
last
time
on
civilised
and
fairly
burst
into
tears
in
the
morning
the
heavy
waggons
rolled
on
again
across
the
upland
prairies
to
strike
the
trail
used
by
the
traders
in
passing
from
the
south
fork
of
the
platte
to
the
arkansa
they
had
for
guide
a
canadian
voyageur
who
had
been
in
the
service
of
the
indian
traders
and
knew
the
route
well
and
who
had
agreed
to
pilot
them
to
fort
lancaster
on
the
north
fork
of
the
platte
their
course
led
for
about
thirty
miles
up
the
boiling
spring
river
whence
they
pursued
a
course
to
the
dividing
ridge
which
separates
the
waters
of
the
platte
and
arkansa
their
progress
was
slow
for
the
ground
was
saturated
with
wet
and
exceedingly
heavy
for
the
cattle
and
they
scarcely
advanced
more
than
ten
miles
at
the
at
night
antoine
the
canadian
guide
amused
them
with
tales
of
the
wild
life
and
perilous
adventures
of
the
hunters
and
trappers
who
make
the
mountains
their
home
often
extorting
a
scream
from
the
women
by
the
description
of
some
scene
of
indian
fight
and
slaughter
or
beguiling
them
of
a
commiserating
tear
by
the
narrative
of
the
sufferings
and
privations
endured
by
those
hardy
hunters
in
their
arduous
life
mary
listened
with
the
greater
interest
since
she
remembered
that
such
was
the
life
which
had
been
led
by
one
very
dear
to
one
long
supposed
to
be
dead
of
whom
she
had
never
but
once
since
his
departure
nearly
fifteen
years
before
heard
a
syllable
her
imagination
pictured
him
as
the
bravest
and
most
daring
of
these
adventurous
hunters
and
conjured
up
his
figure
charging
through
the
midst
of
whooping
savages
or
stretched
on
the
ground
perishing
from
wounds
or
cold
or
famine
amongst
the
characters
who
figured
in
antoine
stories
a
hunter
named
la
bonté
was
made
conspicuous
for
deeds
of
hardiness
and
daring
the
first
mention
of
the
name
caused
the
blood
to
rush
to
mary
face
not
that
she
for
a
moment
imagined
it
was
her
la
bonté
for
she
knew
the
name
was
a
common
one
but
associated
with
feelings
which
she
had
never
got
the
better
of
it
recalled
a
sad
epoch
in
her
former
life
to
which
she
could
not
look
back
without
mingled
pain
and
pleasure
once
only
and
about
two
years
after
his
departure
had
she
ever
received
tidings
of
her
former
lover
a
mountaineer
had
returned
from
the
far
west
to
settle
in
his
native
state
and
had
found
his
way
to
the
neighbourhood
of
old
brand
farm
meeting
him
by
accident
mary
hearing
him
speak
of
the
mountain
hunters
had
inquired
tremblingly
after
la
bonté
her
informant
knew
him
trapped
in
company
with
had
heard
at
the
trading
fort
whence
he
had
taken
his
departure
for
the
settlements
that
la
bonté
had
been
killed
on
the
yellow
stone
by
blackfeet
which
report
was
confirmed
by
some
indians
of
that
nation
this
was
all
she
had
ever
learned
of
the
lover
of
her
youth
now
upon
hearing
the
name
of
la
bonté
so
often
mentioned
by
antoine
a
vague
hope
was
raised
in
her
breast
that
he
was
still
alive
and
she
took
an
opportunity
of
questioning
the
canadian
closely
on
the
subject
who
was
this
la
bonté
antoine
who
you
say
was
so
brave
a
mountaineer
she
asked
one
day

what

and
why

he

ondare
spite
of
the
attempts
of
the
canadian
poor
mary
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
not
that
the
information
took
her
unawares
for
she
long
had
believed
him
dead
but
because
the
very
mention
of
his
name
awoke
the
strongest
feelings
within
her
breast
and
taught
her
how
deep
was
the
affection
she
had
felt
for
him
whose
loss
and
violent
fate
she
now
bewailed
as
the
waggons
of
the
lone
caravan
roll
on
towards
the
platte
we
return
to
the
camp
where
la
bonté
killbuck
and
the
stranger
were
sitting
before
the
fire
when
last
we
saw
them
loquitur
the
doins
of
them
mormon
fools
ca
be
beat
by
spaniards
stranger
their
mummums
and
thummums
you
speak
of
wo
whar
injuns
are
about
nor
pint
out
a
trail
whar
nothin
crossed
but
since
fust
it
snow
on
old
pike
peak
if
they
pack
along
them
as
you
tell
of
who
can
make
it
rain
and
when
the
crowd
gets
out
of
the
buffler
range
they
are
now
that
a
fact
but
this
child
do
believe
it
laugh
to
get
a
sight
on
these
darned
mormonites
i
would
they
account
i
guess
and
it
the
kind
of
action
to
haul
their
women
critters
and
their
young
to
sech
a
starving
country
as
the
they
are
not
all
mormons
in
the
crowd
said
the
strange
hunter
and
there
one
family
amongst
them
with
some
smartish
boys
and
girls
i
tell
you
their
name
la
bonté
looked
up
from
the
lock
of
his
rifle
which
he
was
either
did
hear
or
hearing
did
heed
for
he
continued
his
work
and
they
are
going
to
part
company
continued
the
stranger
and
put
out
alone
for
platte
and
the
south
they
lose
their
hair
i
thinking
said
killbuck
if
the
rapahos
are
out
i
hope
not
continued
the
other
for
there
a
girl
amongst
them
worth
more
than
poor
beaver
said
la
bonté
looking
up
from
his
work
i
hate
to
see
any
white
gal
in
the
hands
of
injuns
and
of
rapahos
worse
than
all
where
does
she
come
from
stranger
down
below
st
louis
from
tennessee
i
heard
them
tennessee
cried
la
bonté
hurrah
for
the
old
state
what
her
name
at
this
moment
killbuck
old
mule
pricked
her
ears
and
snuffed
the
air
which
action
catching
la
bonté
eye
he
rose
abruptly
without
waiting
a
reply
to
his
question
and
exclaimed
the
old
mule
smells
injuns
or
i
a
spaniard
the
hunter
did
the
old
mule
justice
and
she
well
maintained
her
reputation
as
the
best
guard
in
the
mountains
for
in
two
minutes
an
indian
stalked
into
the
camp
dressed
in
a
cloth
capote
and
in
odds
and
ends
of
civilised
attire
rapaho
cried
killbuck
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
and
the
indian
catching
the
word
struck
his
hand
upon
his
breast
and
exclaimed
in
broken
spanish
and
english
mixed
si
si
me
arapaho
white
man
amigo
come
to
heap
amigo
white
man
come
from
gun
puedo
matar
nada
mucha
very
hungry
killbuck
offered
his
pipe
to
the
indian
and
spoke
to
him
in
his
own
language
which
both
he
and
la
bonté
well
understood
they
learned
that
he
was
married
to
a
mexican
woman
and
lived
with
some
hunters
at
the
pueblo
fort
on
the
arkansa
he
volunteered
the
information
that
a
war
party
of
his
people
were
out
on
the
platte
trail
to
intercept
the
indian
traders
on
their
return
from
the
north
fork
and
as
some
mormones
had
just
started
with
three
waggons
in
that
direction
he
said
his
people
would
make
a
being
muy
amigo
himself
to
the
whites
he
cautioned
his
present
companions
from
crossing
to
the
divide
as
the
braves
he
said
were
a
heap
mad
and
their
hearts
were
big
and
nothing
in
the
shape
of
white
skin
would
live
before
them
wagh
exclaimed
killbuck
the
rapahos
know
me
i
thinking
and
small
gain
they
made
against
this
child
i
knowed
the
time
when
my
could
hold
more
of
their
the
indian
was
provided
with
some
powder
of
which
he
stood
in
need
and
after
gorging
as
much
meat
as
his
capacious
stomach
would
hold
he
left
the
camp
and
started
into
the
mountain
the
next
day
our
hunters
started
on
their
journey
down
the
river
travelling
leisurely
and
stopping
wherever
good
grass
presented
itself
one
morning
they
suddenly
struck
a
wheel
trail
which
left
the
creek
banks
and
pursued
a
course
at
right
angles
to
it
in
the
direction
of
the
killbuck
pronounced
it
but
a
few
hours
old
and
that
of
three
waggons
drawn
by
oxen
wagh
he
exclaimed
if
them
poor
devils
of
mormonites
ai
going
head
first
into
the
rapaho
trap
they
be
beaver
afore
ay
said
the
strange
hunter
these
are
the
waggons
belonging
to
old
brand
and
he
has
started
alone
for
laramie
i
hope
nothing
will
happen
to
brand
muttered
la
bonté
i
knowed
that
name
mighty
well
once
years
agone
and
should
hate
the
worst
kind
that
mischief
happened
to
any
one
who
bore
it
this
trail
as
fresh
as
paint
and
it
goes
against
me
to
let
these
simple
critters
help
the
rapahos
to
their
own
hair
this
child
feels
like
helping
out
of
the
scrape
what
do
you
say
old
hos
i
thinks
with
you
boy
answered
killbuck
and
go
in
for
following
this
waggon
trail
and
telling
the
poor
critters
that
thar
danger
ahead
of
them
what
your
talk
stranger
i
go
with
you
shortly
answered
the
latter
and
both
followed
quickly
after
la
bonté
who
was
already
trotting
smartly
on
the
trail
meanwhile
the
three
waggons
containing
the
household
gods
of
the
brand
family
rumbled
slowly
over
the
rolling
prairie
and
towards
the
upland
ridge
of
the
divide
which
studded
with
dwarf
pine
and
cedar
thicket
rose
gradually
before
them
they
travelled
with
considerable
caution
for
already
the
quick
eye
of
antoine
had
discovered
recent
indian
sign
upon
the
trail
and
with
mountain
quickness
had
at
once
made
it
out
to
be
that
of
a
war
party
for
there
were
no
horses
with
them
and
after
one
or
two
of
the
moccasin
tracks
the
mark
of
a
rope
which
trailed
upon
the
ground
was
sufficient
to
show
him
that
the
indians
were
provided
with
the
usual
lasso
of
skin
with
which
to
secure
the
horses
stolen
in
the
expedition
the
men
of
the
party
were
consequently
all
mounted
and
thoroughly
armed
the
waggons
moved
in
a
line
abreast
and
a
sharp
was
kept
on
all
sides
the
women
and
children
were
all
consigned
to
the
interior
of
the
waggons
and
the
latter
had
also
guns
in
readiness
to
take
their
part
in
the
defence
should
an
attack
be
made
however
they
had
seen
no
indians
and
no
fresh
sign
for
two
days
after
they
left
the
boiling
spring
river
and
they
began
to
think
they
were
well
out
of
their
neighbourhood
one
evening
they
camped
on
a
creek
called
black
horse
and
as
usual
had
corralled
the
waggons
and
forted
as
well
as
circumstances
would
permit
when
three
or
four
indians
suddenly
appeared
on
a
bluff
at
a
little
distance
and
making
signals
of
peaceable
intentions
approached
the
camp
most
of
the
men
were
absent
at
the
time
attending
to
the
cattle
or
collecting
fuel
and
only
old
brand
and
one
of
his
young
grandchildren
about
fourteen
years
old
remained
in
camp
the
indians
were
hospitably
received
and
regaled
with
a
smoke
after
which
they
began
to
evince
their
curiosity
by
examining
every
article
lying
about
and
signifying
their
wishes
that
it
should
be
given
to
them
finding
their
hints
were
not
taken
they
laid
hold
of
several
things
which
took
their
fancies
and
amongst
others
of
the
pot
which
was
boiling
on
the
fire
and
with
which
one
of
them
was
about
very
coolly
to
walk
off
when
old
brand
who
up
to
this
moment
had
retained
possession
of
his
temper
seized
it
out
of
the
indian
hand
and
knocked
him
down
one
of
the
others
instantly
began
to
draw
the
buckskin
cover
from
his
gun
and
would
no
doubt
have
taken
summary
vengeance
for
the
insult
offered
to
his
companion
when
mary
brand
courageously
stepped
up
to
him
and
placing
her
left
hand
upon
the
gun
which
he
was
in
the
act
of
uncovering
with
the
other
pointed
a
pistol
at
his
breast
whether
daunted
by
the
bold
act
of
the
girl
or
admiring
her
devotion
to
her
father
the
indian
drew
himself
back
exclaimed
howgh
and
drew
the
cover
again
on
his
piece
went
up
to
old
brand
who
all
this
time
looked
him
sternly
in
the
face
and
shaking
him
by
the
hand
motioned
at
the
same
time
to
the
others
to
be
peaceable
the
other
whites
presently
coming
into
camp
the
indians
sat
quietly
down
by
the
fire
and
when
the
supper
was
ready
joined
in
the
repast
after
which
they
gathered
their
buffalo
robes
about
them
and
quietly
withdrew
meanwhile
antoine
knowing
the
treacherous
character
of
the
savages
advised
that
the
greatest
precaution
should
be
taken
to
secure
the
stock
and
before
dark
therefore
all
the
mules
and
horses
were
hobbled
and
secured
within
the
corral
the
oxen
being
allowed
to
feed
at
the
indians
scarcely
care
to
trouble
themselves
with
such
cattle
a
guard
was
also
set
round
the
camp
and
relieved
every
two
hours
the
fire
was
extinguished
lest
the
savages
should
aim
by
its
light
at
any
of
the
party
and
all
slept
with
rifles
ready
at
their
sides
however
the
night
passed
quietly
and
nothing
disturbed
the
tranquillity
of
the
camp
the
prairie
wolves
loped
hungrily
around
and
their
mournful
cry
was
borne
upon
the
wind
as
they
chased
deer
and
antelope
on
the
neighbouring
plain
but
not
a
sign
of
lurking
indians
was
seen
or
heard
in
the
morning
shortly
after
sunrise
they
were
in
the
act
of
yoking
the
oxen
to
the
waggons
and
driving
in
the
loose
animals
which
had
been
turned
out
to
feed
at
daybreak
when
some
indians
again
appeared
upon
the
bluff
and
descending
it
confidently
approached
the
camp
antoine
strongly
advised
their
not
being
allowed
to
enter
but
brand
ignorant
of
indian
treachery
replied
that
so
long
as
they
came
as
friends
they
could
not
be
deemed
enemies
and
allowed
no
obstruction
to
be
offered
to
their
approach
it
was
now
observed
that
they
were
all
painted
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
and
divested
of
their
buffalo
robes
appearing
naked
to
the
their
legs
only
being
protected
by
deerskin
leggings
reaching
to
the
middle
of
the
thigh
six
or
seven
first
arrived
and
others
quickly
followed
dropping
in
one
after
the
other
until
a
score
or
more
were
collected
round
the
waggons
their
demeanour
at
first
friendly
soon
changed
as
their
numbers
increased
and
they
now
became
urgent
in
their
demands
for
powder
and
lead
and
bullying
in
their
manner
a
chief
accosted
brand
and
through
antoine
informed
him
that
unless
the
demands
of
his
braves
were
acceded
to
he
could
not
be
responsible
for
the
consequences
that
they
were
out
on
the
and
their
eyes
were
red
with
blood
so
that
they
could
not
distinguish
between
white
and
yuta
scalps
that
the
party
with
all
their
women
and
waggons
were
in
the
power
of
the
indian
and
therefore
the
white
chief
best
plan
was
to
make
the
best
terms
he
could
that
all
they
required
was
that
they
should
give
up
their
guns
and
ammunition
the
prairie
and
all
their
mules
and
the
buffaloes
the
oxen
to
draw
their
by
this
time
the
oxen
were
yoked
and
the
teamsters
whip
in
hand
only
waited
the
word
to
start
old
brand
foamed
whilst
the
indian
stated
his
demands
but
hearing
him
to
the
end
exclaimed
darn
the
red
devil
i
would
give
him
a
grain
of
powder
to
save
my
life
put
out
boys
turning
to
his
horse
which
stood
ready
saddled
was
about
to
mount
when
the
indians
sprang
at
once
upon
the
waggons
and
commenced
their
attack
yelling
like
fiends
one
jumped
upon
old
brand
pulled
him
back
as
he
was
rising
in
the
stirrup
and
drew
his
bow
upon
him
at
the
same
moment
in
an
instant
the
old
backwoodsman
pulled
a
pistol
from
his
belt
and
putting
the
muzzle
to
the
indian
heart
shot
him
dead
another
indian
flourishing
his
laid
the
old
man
at
his
feet
whilst
some
dragged
the
women
from
the
waggons
and
others
rushed
upon
the
men
who
made
brave
fight
in
their
defence
mary
when
she
saw
her
father
struck
to
the
ground
sprang
with
a
shrill
cry
to
his
assistance
for
at
that
moment
a
savage
frightful
as
red
paint
could
make
him
was
standing
over
his
prostrate
body
brandishing
a
glittering
knife
in
the
air
preparatory
to
thrusting
it
into
the
old
man
breast
for
the
rest
all
was
confusion
in
vain
the
small
party
of
whites
struggled
against
overpowering
numbers
their
rifles
cracked
but
once
and
they
were
quickly
disarmed
whilst
the
shrieks
of
the
women
and
children
and
the
loud
yells
of
the
indians
added
to
the
scene
of
horror
and
confusion
as
mary
flew
to
her
father
side
an
indian
threw
his
lasso
at
her
the
noose
falling
over
her
shoulders
and
jerking
it
tight
he
uttered
a
delighted
yell
as
the
poor
girl
was
thrown
back
violently
to
the
ground
as
she
fell
another
deliberately
shot
an
arrow
at
her
body
whilst
the
one
who
had
thrown
the
lasso
rushed
forward
his
flashing
in
his
hand
to
seize
the
bloody
trophy
of
his
savage
deed
the
girl
rose
to
her
knees
and
looked
wildly
towards
the
spot
where
her
father
lay
bathed
in
blood
but
the
indian
pulled
the
rope
violently
dragged
her
some
yards
upon
the
ground
and
then
rushed
with
a
yell
of
vengeance
upon
his
victim
he
paused
however
as
at
that
moment
a
shout
as
fierce
as
his
own
sounded
at
his
very
ear
and
looking
up
he
saw
la
bonté
gallopping
madly
down
the
bluff
his
long
hair
and
the
fringes
of
his
and
leggins
flying
in
the
wind
his
right
arm
supporting
his
trusty
rifle
whilst
close
behind
him
came
killbuck
and
the
stranger
dashing
with
loud
hurrahs
to
the
scene
of
action
la
bonté
as
he
charged
down
the
bluff
caught
sight
of
the
girl
struggling
in
the
hands
of
the
ferocious
indian
loud
was
the
of
the
mountaineer
as
he
struck
his
heavy
spurs
to
the
rowels
in
his
horse
side
and
bounded
like
lightning
to
the
rescue
in
a
single
stride
he
was
upon
the
indian
and
thrusting
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
into
his
very
breast
he
pulled
the
trigger
driving
the
savage
backward
by
the
blow
itself
at
the
same
moment
that
the
bullet
passed
through
his
heart
and
tumbled
him
over
throwing
down
his
rifle
la
bonté
wheeled
his
obedient
horse
and
drawing
a
pistol
from
his
belt
again
charged
the
enemy
among
whom
killbuck
and
the
stranger
were
dealing
blows
yelling
for
victory
the
mountaineers
rushed
at
the
indians
and
they
at
the
sudden
attack
and
thinking
this
was
but
the
advanced
guard
of
a
large
band
fairly
turned
and
fled
leaving
five
of
their
number
dead
upon
the
field
mary
shutting
her
eyes
to
the
expected
heard
the
loud
shout
la
bonté
gave
in
charging
down
the
bluff
and
again
looking
up
saw
the
mountaineer
rush
to
her
rescue
and
save
her
from
the
savage
by
his
timely
blow
her
arms
were
still
pinned
by
the
lasso
which
prevented
her
from
rising
to
her
feet
and
la
bonté
was
the
first
to
run
to
aid
her
as
soon
as
the
fight
was
fairly
over
he
jumped
from
his
horse
cut
the
skin
rope
which
bound
her
raised
her
from
the
ground
and
upon
her
turning
up
her
face
to
thank
him
beheld
his
mary
brand
whilst
she
hardly
believing
her
senses
recognised
in
her
deliverer
her
former
lover
and
still
la
bonté
what
mary
can
it
be
you
he
asked
looking
intently
upon
the
trembling
woman
la
bonté
you
do
forget
me
she
answered
and
threw
herself
sobbing
into
the
arms
of
the
sturdy
mountaineer
there
we
will
leave
her
for
the
present
and
help
killbuck
and
his
companions
to
examine
the
killed
and
wounded
of
the
former
five
indians
and
two
whites
lay
dead
grandchildren
of
old
brand
fine
lads
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
who
had
fought
with
the
greatest
bravery
and
lay
pierced
with
arrows
and
lance
wounds
old
brand
had
received
a
sore
buffet
but
a
hatful
of
cold
water
from
the
creek
sprinkled
over
his
face
soon
restored
him
his
sons
had
not
escaped
and
antoine
was
shot
through
the
neck
and
falling
had
actually
been
half
scalped
by
an
indian
whom
the
timely
arrival
of
la
bonté
had
caused
to
leave
his
work
unfinished
silently
and
with
sad
hearts
the
survivors
of
the
family
saw
the
bodies
of
the
two
boys
buried
on
the
river
bank
and
the
spot
marked
with
a
pile
of
loose
stones
procured
from
the
rocky
bed
of
the
creek
the
carcasses
of
the
treacherous
indians
were
left
to
be
devoured
by
wolves
and
their
bones
to
bleach
in
the
sun
and
warning
to
their
tribe
that
such
foul
treachery
as
they
had
meditated
had
met
with
a
merited
retribution
the
next
day
the
party
continued
their
course
to
the
platte
antoine
and
the
stranger
returned
to
the
arkansa
starting
in
the
night
to
avoid
the
indians
but
killbuck
and
la
bonté
lent
the
aid
of
their
rifles
to
the
solitary
caravan
and
under
their
experienced
guidance
no
more
indian
perils
were
encountered
mary
no
longer
sat
perched
up
in
her
father
conostoga
but
rode
a
quiet
mustang
by
la
side
and
no
doubt
they
found
a
theme
with
which
to
while
away
the
monotonous
journey
over
the
dreary
plains
south
fork
was
passed
and
laramie
was
reached
the
sweet
water
mountains
which
hang
over
the
pass
to
california
were
long
since
in
sight
but
when
the
waters
of
the
north
fork
of
platte
lay
before
their
horses
feet
and
the
broad
trail
was
pointed
out
which
led
to
the
great
valley
of
columbia
and
their
promised
land
the
heads
of
the
oxen
were
turned
the
stream
where
the
shallow
waters
flow
on
to
join
the
great
not
towards
the
mountains
where
they
leave
their
from
which
springs
flow
several
coursing
their
way
to
the
eastward
fertilising
in
their
route
to
the
atlantic
the
lands
of
civilised
man
others
westward
forcing
a
passage
through
rocky
cañons
and
flowing
through
a
barren
wilderness
inhabited
by
fierce
and
barbarous
tribes
these
were
the
routes
to
choose
from
and
what
ever
was
the
cause
the
oxen
turned
their
yoked
heads
away
from
the
rugged
mountains
the
teamsters
joyfully
cracked
their
ponderous
whips
as
the
waggons
rolled
lightly
down
the
platte
and
men
women
and
children
waved
their
hats
and
bonnets
in
the
air
and
cried
out
lustily
hurrah
for
home
la
bonté
looked
at
the
dark
sombre
mountains
ere
he
turned
his
back
upon
them
for
the
last
time
he
thought
of
the
many
years
he
had
spent
beneath
their
rugged
shadow
of
the
many
hardships
he
had
suffered
of
all
his
pains
and
perils
in
those
wild
regions
the
most
exciting
episodes
of
his
adventurous
career
his
tried
companions
in
scenes
of
fierce
fight
and
bloodshed
passed
in
review
before
him
a
feeling
of
regret
was
creeping
over
him
when
mary
laid
her
hand
gently
on
his
shoulder
one
single
tear
rolled
unbidden
down
his
cheek
and
he
answered
her
inquiring
eyes
i
not
sorry
to
leave
it
mary
he
said
but
it
hard
to
turn
one
back
upon
old
they
had
a
hard
battle
with
killbuck
in
endeavouring
to
persuade
him
to
accompany
them
to
the
settlements
the
old
mountaineer
shook
his
head
the
time
he
said
was
gone
by
for
that
he
had
often
thought
of
it
but
when
the
day
arrived
he
had
heart
to
leave
the
mountains
trapping
now
was
of
no
account
he
knew
but
beaver
was
bound
to
rise
and
then
the
good
times
would
come
again
what
could
he
do
in
the
settlements
where
there
was
room
to
move
and
where
it
was
hard
to
were
so
many
people
he
accompanied
them
a
considerable
distance
down
the
river
ever
and
anon
looking
cautiously
back
to
ascertain
that
he
had
not
gone
out
of
sight
of
the
mountains
before
reaching
the
forks
however
he
finally
bade
them
adieu
and
turning
the
head
of
his
old
grizzled
mule
westward
he
heartily
wrung
the
hand
of
his
comrade
la
bonté
and
crying
yep
to
his
animal
disappeared
behind
a
roll
of
the
prairie
and
was
seen
no
thousand
good
wishes
for
the
welfare
of
the
sturdy
trapper
speeding
him
on
his
solitary
way
four
months
from
the
day
when
la
bonté
so
opportunely
appeared
to
rescue
brand
family
from
the
indians
on
black
horse
creek
that
worthy
and
the
faithful
mary
were
duly
and
lawfully
united
in
the
township
church
of
brandville
memphis
county
state
of
tennessee
we
can
not
say
in
the
concluding
words
of
nine
hundred
and
thousand
novels
that
numerous
pledges
of
mutual
love
surrounded
and
cheered
them
in
their
declining
years
because
it
was
only
on
the
of
july
in
the
year
of
our
lord
that
la
bonté
and
mary
brand
were
finally
made
one
after
fifteen
long
years
of
separation
the
fate
of
one
of
the
humble
characters
who
have
figured
in
these
pages
we
must
yet
tarry
a
little
longer
to
describe
during
the
past
winter
a
party
of
mountaineers
flying
from
overpowering
numbers
of
hostile
sioux
found
themselves
one
stormy
evening
in
a
wild
and
dismal
cañon
near
the
elevated
mountain
valley
called
the
new
the
rocky
bed
of
a
dry
mountain
torrent
whose
waters
were
now
locked
up
at
their
by
icy
fetters
was
the
only
road
up
which
they
could
make
their
difficult
way
for
the
rugged
sides
of
the
gorge
rose
precipitously
from
the
creek
scarcely
affording
a
to
even
the
active
bighorn
which
occasionally
looked
down
upon
the
travellers
from
the
lofty
summit
logs
of
pine
uprooted
by
the
hurricanes
which
sweep
incessantly
through
the
mountain
defiles
and
tossed
headlong
from
the
surrounding
ridges
continually
obstructed
their
way
and
huge
rocks
and
boulders
fallen
from
the
heights
and
blocking
up
the
bed
of
the
stream
added
to
the
difficulty
and
threatened
them
every
instant
with
destruction
towards
sundown
they
reached
a
point
where
the
cañon
opened
out
into
a
little
shelving
glade
or
prairie
a
few
hundred
yards
in
extent
the
entrance
to
which
was
almost
hidden
by
a
thicket
of
dwarf
pine
and
cedar
here
they
determined
to
encamp
for
the
night
in
a
spot
secure
from
indians
and
as
they
imagined
untrodden
by
the
foot
of
man
what
however
was
their
astonishment
on
breaking
through
the
entrance
to
perceive
a
solitary
horse
standing
motionless
in
the
centre
of
the
prairie
drawing
near
they
found
it
to
be
an
old
grizzled
mustang
or
indian
pony
with
cropped
ears
and
ragged
tail
well
picked
by
hungry
mules
standing
doubled
up
with
cold
and
at
the
very
last
gasp
from
extreme
old
age
and
weakness
its
bones
were
nearly
through
the
stiffened
skin
the
legs
of
the
animal
were
gathered
under
it
whilst
its
head
and
neck
hung
listlessly
downwards
almost
overbalancing
its
tottering
body
the
glazed
and
sunken
protruding
and
heaving
flank
and
quivering
its
race
was
run
and
the
driving
sleet
and
snow
and
penetrating
winter
blast
scarce
made
impression
upon
its
callous
and
frame
one
of
the
band
of
mountaineers
was
marcellin
and
a
single
look
at
the
miserable
beast
was
sufficient
for
him
to
recognise
the
once
renowned
steed
of
old
bill
williams
that
the
owner
himself
was
not
far
distant
he
felt
certain
and
searching
carefully
around
the
hunters
presently
came
upon
an
old
camp
before
which
lay
protruding
from
the
snow
the
blackened
remains
of
pine
logs
before
these
which
had
been
the
fire
and
leaning
with
his
back
against
a
