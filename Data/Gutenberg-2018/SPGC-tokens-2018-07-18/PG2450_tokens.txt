i
a
slow
journey
again
two
carriages
stood
at
the
front
door
of
the
house
at
petrovskoe
in
one
of
them
sat
mimi
the
two
girls
and
their
maid
with
the
bailiff
jakoff
on
the
box
while
in
the
other
a
britchka
sat
woloda
myself
and
our
servant
vassili
papa
who
was
to
follow
us
to
moscow
in
a
few
days
was
standing
bareheaded
on
the
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
at
the
windows
of
the
carriages
and
said
christ
go
with
you
jakoff
and
our
coachman
for
we
had
our
own
horses
lifted
their
caps
in
answer
and
also
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
amen
god
go
with
us
the
carriages
began
to
roll
away
and
the
of
the
great
avenue
filed
out
of
sight
i
was
not
in
the
least
depressed
on
this
occasion
for
my
mind
was
not
so
much
turned
upon
what
i
had
left
as
upon
what
was
awaiting
me
in
proportion
as
the
various
objects
connected
with
the
sad
recollections
which
had
recently
filled
my
imagination
receded
behind
me
those
recollections
lost
their
power
and
gave
place
to
a
consolatory
feeling
of
life
youthful
vigour
freshness
and
hope
seldom
have
i
spent
four
days
more
well
i
will
not
say
gaily
since
i
should
still
have
shrunk
from
appearing
gay
but
more
agreeably
and
pleasantly
than
those
occupied
by
our
journey
no
longer
were
my
eyes
confronted
with
the
closed
door
of
mamma
s
room
which
i
had
never
been
able
to
pass
without
a
pang
nor
with
the
covered
piano
which
nobody
opened
now
and
at
which
i
could
never
look
without
trembling
nor
with
mourning
dresses
we
had
each
of
us
on
our
ordinary
travelling
clothes
nor
with
all
those
other
objects
which
recalled
to
me
so
vividly
our
irreparable
loss
and
forced
me
to
abstain
from
any
manifestation
of
merriment
lest
i
should
unwittingly
offend
against
her
memory
on
the
contrary
a
continual
succession
of
new
and
exciting
objects
and
places
now
caught
and
held
my
attention
and
the
charms
of
spring
awakened
in
my
soul
a
soothing
sense
of
satisfaction
with
the
present
and
of
blissful
hope
for
the
future
very
early
next
morning
the
merciless
vassili
who
had
only
just
entered
our
service
and
was
therefore
like
most
people
in
such
a
position
zealous
to
a
fault
came
and
stripped
off
my
counterpane
affirming
that
it
was
time
for
me
to
get
up
since
everything
was
in
readiness
for
us
to
continue
our
journey
though
i
felt
inclined
to
stretch
myself
and
rebel
though
i
would
gladly
have
spent
another
quarter
of
an
hour
in
sweet
enjoyment
of
my
morning
slumber
vassili
s
inexorable
face
showed
that
he
would
grant
me
no
respite
but
that
he
was
ready
to
tear
away
the
counterpane
twenty
times
more
if
necessary
accordingly
i
submitted
myself
to
the
inevitable
and
ran
down
into
the
courtyard
to
wash
myself
at
the
fountain
in
the
a
was
already
surmounting
the
fire
which
milka
the
ostler
as
red
in
the
face
as
a
crab
was
blowing
with
a
pair
of
bellows
all
was
grey
and
misty
in
the
courtyard
like
steam
from
a
smoking
dunghill
but
in
the
eastern
sky
the
sun
was
diffusing
a
clear
cheerful
radiance
and
making
the
straw
roofs
of
the
sheds
around
the
courtyard
sparkle
with
the
night
dew
beneath
them
stood
our
horses
tied
to
mangers
and
i
could
hear
the
ceaseless
sound
of
their
chewing
a
dog
which
had
been
spending
the
night
on
a
dry
dunghill
now
rose
in
lazy
fashion
and
wagging
its
tail
walked
slowly
across
the
courtyard
the
bustling
landlady
opened
the
creaking
gates
turned
her
meditative
cows
into
the
street
whence
came
the
lowing
and
bellowing
of
other
cattle
and
exchanged
a
word
or
two
with
a
sleepy
neighbour
philip
with
his
rolled
up
was
working
the
windlass
of
a
and
sending
sparkling
fresh
water
coursing
into
an
oaken
trough
while
in
the
pool
beneath
it
some
ducks
were
taking
a
bath
it
gave
me
pleasure
to
watch
his
bearded
face
and
the
veins
and
muscles
as
they
stood
out
upon
his
great
powerful
hands
whenever
he
made
an
extra
effort
in
the
room
behind
the
where
mimi
and
the
girls
had
slept
yet
so
near
to
ourselves
that
we
had
exchanged
confidences
overnight
movements
now
became
audible
their
maid
kept
passing
in
and
out
with
clothes
and
at
last
the
door
opened
and
we
were
summoned
to
breakfast
woloda
however
remained
in
a
state
of
bustle
throughout
as
he
ran
to
fetch
first
one
article
and
then
another
and
urged
the
maid
to
hasten
her
preparations
the
horses
were
put
to
and
showed
their
impatience
by
tinkling
their
bells
parcels
trunks
and
boxes
were
replaced
and
we
set
about
taking
our
seats
yet
every
time
that
we
got
in
the
mountain
of
luggage
in
the
britchka
seemed
to
have
grown
larger
than
before
and
we
had
much
ado
to
understand
how
things
had
been
arranged
yesterday
and
how
we
should
sit
now
a
in
particular
greatly
inconvenienced
me
but
vassili
declared
that
things
will
soon
right
themselves
and
i
had
no
choice
but
to
believe
him
the
sun
was
just
rising
covered
with
dense
white
clouds
and
every
object
around
us
was
standing
out
in
a
cheerful
calm
sort
of
radiance
the
whole
was
beautiful
to
look
at
and
i
felt
comfortable
and
light
of
heart
before
us
the
road
ran
like
a
broad
sinuous
ribbon
through
cornfields
glittering
with
dew
here
and
there
a
dark
bush
or
young
cast
a
long
shadow
over
the
ruts
and
scattered
of
the
track
yet
even
the
monotonous
din
of
our
and
could
not
drown
the
joyous
song
of
soaring
larks
nor
the
combined
odour
of
cloth
dust
and
sourness
peculiar
to
our
britchka
overpower
the
fresh
scents
of
the
morning
i
felt
in
my
heart
that
delightful
impulse
to
be
up
and
doing
which
is
a
sign
of
sincere
enjoyment
as
i
had
not
been
able
to
say
my
prayers
in
the
courtyard
of
the
inn
but
had
nevertheless
been
assured
once
that
on
the
very
first
day
when
i
omitted
to
perform
that
ceremony
some
misfortune
would
overtake
me
i
now
hastened
to
rectify
the
omission
taking
off
my
cap
and
stooping
down
in
a
corner
of
the
britchka
i
duly
recited
my
orisons
and
unobtrusively
signed
the
sign
of
the
cross
beneath
my
coat
yet
all
the
while
a
thousand
different
objects
were
distracting
my
attention
and
more
than
once
i
inadvertently
repeated
a
prayer
twice
over
soon
on
the
little
footpath
beside
the
road
became
visible
some
slowly
moving
figures
they
were
pilgrims
on
their
heads
they
had
dirty
handkerchiefs
on
their
backs
wallets
of
and
on
their
feet
bundles
of
soiled
rags
and
heavy
bast
shoes
moving
their
staffs
in
regular
rhythm
and
scarcely
throwing
us
a
glance
they
pressed
onwards
with
heavy
tread
and
in
single
file
where
have
they
come
from
i
wondered
to
myself
and
whither
are
they
bound
is
it
a
long
pilgrimage
they
are
making
but
soon
the
shadows
they
cast
on
the
road
became
indistinguishable
from
the
shadows
of
the
bushes
which
they
passed
next
a
could
be
seen
approaching
us
in
two
seconds
the
faces
which
looked
out
at
us
from
it
with
smiling
curiosity
had
vanished
how
strange
it
seemed
that
those
faces
should
have
nothing
in
common
with
me
and
that
in
all
probability
they
would
never
meet
my
eyes
again
next
came
a
pair
of
with
the
traces
looped
up
to
their
collars
on
one
of
them
a
young
lamb
s
wool
cap
cocked
to
one
negligently
kicking
his
booted
legs
against
the
flanks
of
his
steed
as
he
sang
a
melancholy
ditty
yet
his
face
and
attitude
seemed
to
me
to
express
such
perfect
carelessness
and
indolent
ease
that
i
imagined
it
to
be
the
height
of
happiness
to
be
a
postillion
and
to
sing
melancholy
songs
far
off
through
a
cutting
in
the
road
there
soon
stood
out
against
the
sky
the
green
roof
of
a
village
church
presently
the
village
itself
became
visible
together
with
the
roof
of
the
and
the
garden
attached
to
it
who
lived
in
that
house
children
parents
teachers
why
should
we
not
call
there
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
its
inmates
next
we
overtook
a
file
of
loaded
waggons
a
procession
to
which
our
vehicles
had
to
yield
the
road
what
have
you
got
in
there
asked
vassili
of
one
waggoner
who
was
dangling
his
legs
lazily
over
the
splashboard
of
his
conveyance
and
flicking
his
whip
about
as
he
gazed
at
us
with
a
stolid
vacant
look
but
he
only
made
answer
when
we
were
too
far
off
to
catch
what
he
said
and
what
have
you
got
asked
vassili
of
a
second
waggoner
who
was
lying
at
full
length
under
a
new
rug
on
the
of
his
vehicle
the
red
poll
and
red
face
beneath
it
lifted
themselves
up
for
a
second
from
the
folds
of
the
rug
measured
our
britchka
with
a
cold
contemptuous
look
and
lay
down
again
whereupon
i
concluded
that
the
driver
was
wondering
to
himself
who
we
were
whence
we
had
come
and
whither
we
were
going
these
various
objects
of
interest
had
absorbed
so
much
of
my
time
that
as
yet
i
had
paid
no
attention
to
the
crooked
figures
on
the
verst
posts
as
we
passed
them
in
rapid
succession
but
in
time
the
sun
began
to
burn
my
head
and
back
the
road
to
become
increasingly
dusty
the
impedimenta
in
the
carriage
to
grow
more
and
more
uncomfortable
and
myself
to
feel
more
and
more
cramped
consequently
i
relapsed
into
devoting
my
whole
faculties
to
the
and
their
numerals
and
to
solving
difficult
mathematical
problems
for
reckoning
the
time
when
we
should
arrive
at
the
next
twelve
versts
are
a
third
of
and
in
all
there
are
to
lipetz
we
have
done
a
third
and
how
much
then
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
vassili
was
my
next
remark
on
observing
that
he
was
beginning
to
nod
on
the
suppose
we
change
seats
will
you
vassili
agreed
and
had
no
sooner
stretched
himself
out
in
the
body
of
the
vehicle
than
he
began
to
snore
to
me
on
my
new
perch
however
a
most
interesting
spectacle
now
became
visible
namely
our
horses
all
of
which
were
familiar
to
me
down
to
the
smallest
detail
why
is
diashak
on
the
right
today
philip
not
on
the
left
i
asked
knowingly
and
nerusinka
is
not
doing
her
proper
share
of
the
one
could
not
put
diashak
on
the
left
replied
philip
altogether
ignoring
my
last
remark
he
is
not
the
kind
of
horse
to
put
there
at
all
a
horse
like
the
one
on
the
left
now
is
the
right
kind
of
one
for
the
after
this
fragment
of
eloquence
philip
turned
towards
diashak
and
began
to
do
his
best
to
worry
the
poor
animal
by
jogging
at
the
reins
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
diashak
was
doing
well
and
dragging
the
vehicle
almost
unaided
this
philip
continued
to
do
until
he
found
it
convenient
to
breathe
and
rest
himself
awhile
and
to
settle
his
cap
askew
though
it
had
looked
well
enough
before
i
profited
by
the
opportunity
to
ask
him
to
let
me
have
the
reins
to
hold
until
the
whole
six
in
my
hand
as
well
as
the
whip
i
had
attained
complete
happiness
several
times
i
asked
whether
i
was
doing
things
right
but
as
usual
philip
was
never
satisfied
and
soon
destroyed
my
felicity
the
heat
increased
until
a
hand
showed
itself
at
the
carriage
window
and
waved
a
bottle
and
a
parcel
of
eatables
whereupon
vassili
leapt
briskly
from
the
britchka
and
ran
forward
to
get
us
something
to
eat
and
drink
when
we
arrived
at
a
steep
descent
we
all
got
out
and
ran
down
it
to
a
little
bridge
while
vassili
and
jakoff
followed
supporting
the
carriage
on
either
side
as
though
to
hold
it
up
in
the
event
of
its
threatening
to
upset
after
that
mimi
gave
permission
for
a
change
of
seats
and
sometimes
woloda
or
myself
would
ride
in
the
carriage
and
lubotshka
or
katenka
in
the
britchka
this
arrangement
greatly
pleased
the
girls
since
much
more
fun
went
on
in
the
britchka
just
when
the
day
was
at
its
hottest
we
got
out
at
a
wood
and
breaking
off
a
quantity
of
branches
transformed
our
vehicle
into
a
bower
this
travelling
arbour
then
bustled
on
to
catch
the
carriage
up
and
had
the
effect
of
exciting
lubotshka
to
one
of
those
piercing
shrieks
of
delight
which
she
was
in
the
habit
of
occasionally
emitting
at
last
we
drew
near
the
village
where
we
were
to
halt
and
dine
already
we
could
perceive
the
smell
of
the
place
the
smell
of
smoke
and
tar
and
distinguish
the
sound
of
voices
footsteps
and
carts
the
bells
on
our
horses
began
to
ring
less
clearly
than
they
had
done
in
the
open
country
and
on
both
sides
the
road
became
lined
with
huts
dwellings
with
straw
roofs
carved
porches
and
small
red
or
green
painted
shutters
to
the
windows
through
which
here
and
there
was
a
woman
s
face
looking
inquisitively
out
peasant
children
clad
in
smocks
only
stood
staring
or
stretching
out
their
arms
to
us
ran
barefooted
through
the
dust
to
climb
on
to
the
luggage
behind
despite
philip
s
menacing
gestures
likewise
waiters
came
darting
around
the
carriages
to
invite
us
with
words
and
signs
to
select
their
several
hostelries
as
our
presently
a
gate
creaked
and
we
entered
a
courtyard
four
hours
of
rest
and
liberty
now
awaited
us
ii
the
thunderstorm
the
sun
was
sinking
towards
the
west
and
his
long
hot
rays
were
burning
my
neck
and
cheeks
beyond
endurance
while
thick
clouds
of
dust
were
rising
from
the
road
and
filling
the
whole
air
not
the
slightest
wind
was
there
to
carry
it
away
i
could
not
think
what
to
do
neither
the
face
of
woloda
dozing
in
a
corner
nor
the
motion
of
philip
s
back
nor
the
long
shadow
of
our
britchka
as
it
came
bowling
along
behind
us
brought
me
any
relief
i
concentrated
my
whole
attention
upon
the
ahead
and
the
clouds
which
hitherto
dispersed
over
the
sky
were
now
assuming
a
menacing
blackness
and
beginning
to
form
themselves
into
a
single
solid
mass
from
time
to
time
distant
thunder
could
be
heard
a
circumstance
which
greatly
increased
my
impatience
to
arrive
at
the
inn
where
we
were
to
spend
the
night
a
thunderstorm
always
communicated
to
me
an
inexpressibly
oppressive
feeling
of
fear
and
gloom
yet
we
were
still
ten
versts
from
the
next
village
and
in
the
meanwhile
the
large
purple
cloudbank
arisen
from
no
one
knows
where
was
advancing
steadily
towards
us
the
sun
not
yet
obscured
was
picking
out
its
fuscous
shape
with
dazzling
light
and
marking
its
front
with
grey
stripes
running
right
down
to
the
horizon
at
intervals
vivid
lightning
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
followed
by
low
rumbles
which
increased
steadily
in
volume
until
they
merged
into
a
prolonged
roll
which
seemed
to
embrace
the
entire
heavens
at
length
vassili
got
up
and
covered
over
the
britchka
the
coachman
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
cloak
and
lifted
his
cap
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
at
each
successive
thunderclap
and
the
horses
pricked
up
their
ears
and
snorted
as
though
to
drink
in
the
fresh
air
which
the
flying
clouds
were
outdistancing
the
britchka
began
to
roll
more
swiftly
along
the
dusty
road
and
i
felt
uneasy
and
as
though
the
blood
were
coursing
more
quickly
through
my
veins
soon
the
clouds
had
veiled
the
face
of
the
sun
and
though
he
threw
a
last
gleam
of
light
to
the
dark
and
terrifying
horizon
he
had
no
choice
but
to
disappear
behind
them
suddenly
everything
around
us
seemed
changed
and
assumed
a
gloomy
aspect
a
wood
of
aspen
trees
which
we
were
passing
seemed
to
be
all
in
a
tremble
with
its
leaves
showing
white
against
the
dark
lilac
background
of
the
clouds
murmuring
together
in
an
agitated
manner
the
tops
of
the
larger
trees
began
to
bend
to
and
fro
and
dried
leaves
and
grass
to
whirl
about
in
eddies
over
the
road
swallows
and
swifts
came
darting
around
the
britchka
and
even
passing
in
front
of
the
forelegs
of
the
horses
while
rooks
despite
their
outstretched
wings
were
laid
as
it
were
on
their
keels
by
the
wind
finally
the
leather
apron
which
covered
us
began
to
flutter
about
and
to
beat
against
the
sides
of
the
conveyance
the
lightning
flashed
right
into
the
britchka
as
cleaving
the
obscurity
for
a
second
it
lit
up
the
grey
cloth
and
silk
galloon
of
the
lining
and
woloda
s
figure
pressed
back
into
a
corner
next
came
a
terrible
sound
which
rising
higher
and
higher
and
spreading
further
and
further
increased
until
it
reached
its
climax
in
a
deafening
thunderclap
which
made
us
tremble
and
hold
our
breaths
the
wrath
of
god
what
poetry
there
is
in
that
simple
popular
conception
the
pace
of
the
vehicle
was
continually
increasing
and
from
philip
s
and
vassili
s
backs
the
former
was
tugging
furiously
at
the
reins
i
could
see
that
they
too
were
alarmed
bowling
rapidly
down
an
incline
the
britchka
cannoned
violently
against
a
wooden
bridge
at
the
bottom
i
dared
not
stir
and
expected
destruction
every
moment
crack
a
trace
had
given
way
and
in
spite
of
the
ceaseless
deafening
thunderclaps
we
had
to
pull
up
on
the
bridge
leaning
my
head
despairingly
against
the
side
of
the
britchka
i
followed
with
a
beating
heart
the
movements
of
philip
s
great
black
fingers
as
he
tied
up
the
broken
trace
and
with
hands
and
the
of
the
whip
pushed
the
harness
vigorously
back
into
its
place
my
sense
of
terror
was
increasing
with
the
violence
of
the
thunder
indeed
at
the
moment
of
supreme
silence
which
generally
precedes
the
greatest
intensity
of
a
storm
it
mounted
to
such
a
height
that
i
felt
as
though
another
quarter
of
an
hour
of
this
emotion
would
kill
me
just
then
there
appeared
from
beneath
the
bridge
a
human
being
who
clad
in
a
torn
filthy
smock
and
supported
on
a
pair
of
thin
shanks
bare
of
muscles
thrust
an
idiotic
face
a
tremulous
bare
shaven
head
and
a
pair
of
red
shining
stumps
in
place
of
hands
into
the
britchka
lord
a
copeck
for
for
god
s
sake
groaned
a
feeble
voice
as
at
each
word
the
wretched
being
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
bowed
himself
to
the
ground
i
can
not
describe
the
chill
feeling
of
horror
which
penetrated
my
heart
at
that
moment
a
shudder
crept
through
all
my
hair
and
my
eyes
stared
in
vacant
terror
at
the
outcast
vassili
who
was
charged
with
the
apportioning
of
alms
during
the
journey
was
busy
helping
philip
and
only
when
everything
had
been
put
straight
and
philip
had
resumed
the
reins
again
had
he
time
to
look
for
his
purse
hardly
had
the
britchka
begun
to
move
when
a
blinding
flash
filled
the
welkin
with
a
blaze
of
light
which
brought
the
horses
to
their
haunches
then
the
flash
was
followed
by
such
an
roar
that
the
very
vault
of
heaven
seemed
to
be
descending
upon
our
heads
the
wind
blew
harder
than
ever
and
vassili
s
cloak
the
manes
and
tails
of
the
horses
and
the
were
all
slanted
in
one
direction
as
they
waved
furiously
in
the
violent
blast
presently
upon
the
britchka
s
top
there
fell
some
large
drops
of
rain
one
two
three
then
suddenly
and
as
though
a
roll
of
drums
were
being
beaten
over
our
heads
the
whole
countryside
resounded
with
the
clatter
of
the
deluge
from
vassili
s
movements
i
could
see
that
he
had
now
got
his
purse
open
and
that
the
poor
outcast
was
still
bowing
and
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
as
he
ran
beside
the
wheels
of
the
vehicle
at
the
imminent
risk
of
being
run
over
and
reiterated
from
time
to
time
his
plea
god
s
sake
at
last
a
copeck
rolled
upon
the
ground
and
the
miserable
creature
his
mutilated
arms
with
their
sleeves
wet
through
and
through
held
out
before
him
stopped
perplexed
in
the
roadway
and
vanished
from
my
sight
the
heavy
rain
driven
before
the
tempestuous
wind
poured
down
in
pailfuls
and
dripping
from
vassili
s
thick
cloak
formed
a
series
of
pools
on
the
apron
the
dust
became
changed
to
a
paste
which
clung
to
the
wheels
and
the
ruts
became
transformed
into
muddy
rivulets
at
last
however
the
lightning
grew
paler
and
more
diffuse
and
the
thunderclaps
lost
some
of
their
terror
amid
the
monotonous
rattling
of
the
downpour
then
the
rain
also
abated
and
the
clouds
began
to
disperse
in
the
region
of
the
sun
a
lightness
appeared
and
between
the
clouds
could
be
caught
glimpses
of
an
azure
sky
finally
a
dazzling
ray
shot
across
the
pools
on
the
road
shot
through
the
threads
of
rain
now
falling
thin
and
straight
as
from
a
sieve
and
fell
upon
the
fresh
leaves
and
blades
of
grass
the
great
cloud
was
still
louring
black
and
threatening
on
the
far
horizon
but
i
no
longer
felt
afraid
of
it
i
felt
only
an
inexpressibly
pleasant
hopefulness
in
proportion
as
trust
in
life
replaced
the
late
burden
of
fear
indeed
my
heart
was
smiling
like
that
of
refreshed
revivified
nature
herself
vassili
took
off
his
cloak
and
wrung
the
water
from
it
woloda
flung
back
the
apron
and
i
stood
up
in
the
britchka
to
drink
in
the
new
fresh
air
in
front
of
us
was
the
carriage
rolling
along
and
looking
as
wet
and
resplendent
in
the
sunlight
as
though
it
had
just
been
polished
on
one
side
of
the
road
boundless
oatfields
intersected
in
places
by
small
ravines
which
now
showed
bright
with
their
moist
earth
and
greenery
stretched
to
the
far
horizon
like
a
checkered
carpet
while
on
the
other
side
of
us
an
aspen
wood
intermingled
with
hazel
bushes
and
parquetted
with
wild
thyme
in
joyous
profusion
no
longer
rustled
and
trembled
but
slowly
dropped
rich
sparkling
diamonds
from
its
branches
on
to
the
withered
leaves
of
last
year
from
above
us
from
every
side
came
the
happy
songs
of
little
birds
calling
to
one
another
among
the
dripping
brushwood
while
clear
from
the
inmost
depths
of
the
wood
sounded
the
voice
of
the
cuckoo
so
delicious
was
the
wondrous
scent
of
the
wood
the
scent
which
follows
a
thunderstorm
in
spring
the
scent
of
violets
mushrooms
and
thyme
that
i
could
no
longer
remain
in
the
britchka
jumping
out
i
ran
to
some
bushes
and
regardless
of
the
showers
of
drops
discharged
upon
me
tore
off
a
few
sprigs
of
thyme
and
buried
my
face
in
them
to
smell
their
glorious
scent
then
despite
the
mud
which
had
got
into
my
boots
as
also
the
fact
that
my
stockings
were
soaked
i
went
skipping
through
the
puddles
to
the
window
of
the
carriage
lubotshka
katenka
i
shouted
as
i
handed
them
some
of
the
thyme
just
look
how
delicious
this
is
the
girls
smelt
it
and
cried
but
mimi
shrieked
to
me
to
go
away
for
fear
i
should
be
run
over
by
the
wheels
oh
but
smell
how
delicious
it
is
i
persisted
iii
a
new
point
of
view
katenka
was
with
me
in
the
britchka
her
lovely
head
inclined
as
she
gazed
pensively
at
the
roadway
i
looked
at
her
in
silence
and
wondered
what
had
brought
the
unchildlike
expression
of
sadness
to
her
face
which
i
now
observed
for
the
first
time
there
we
shall
soon
be
in
moscow
i
said
at
last
how
large
do
you
suppose
it
is
i
don
t
know
she
replied
well
but
how
large
do
you
imagine
as
large
as
serpukhov
what
do
you
say
yet
the
instinctive
feeling
which
enables
one
person
to
guess
the
thoughts
of
another
and
serves
as
a
guiding
thread
in
conversation
soon
made
katenka
feel
that
her
indifference
was
disagreeable
to
me
wherefore
she
raised
her
head
presently
and
turning
round
said
did
your
papa
tell
you
that
we
girls
too
were
going
to
live
at
your
grandmamma
s
yes
he
said
that
we
should
all
live
all
live
there
yes
of
course
we
shall
have
one
half
of
the
upper
floor
and
you
the
other
half
and
papa
the
wing
but
we
shall
all
of
us
dine
together
with
grandmamma
but
mamma
says
that
your
grandmamma
is
so
very
grave
and
so
easily
made
angry
no
she
only
seems
like
that
at
first
she
is
grave
but
not
on
the
contrary
she
is
both
kind
and
cheerful
if
you
could
only
have
seen
the
ball
at
her
house
all
the
same
i
am
afraid
of
her
besides
who
knows
whether
we
katenka
stopped
short
and
once
again
became
thoughtful
what
i
asked
with
some
anxiety
nothing
i
only
said
that
no
you
said
who
knows
whether
we
and
you
said
didn
t
you
that
once
there
was
ever
such
a
ball
at
grandmamma
s
yes
it
is
a
pity
you
were
not
there
there
were
heaps
of
guests
about
a
thousand
people
and
all
of
them
princes
or
generals
and
there
was
music
and
i
danced
but
katenka
i
broke
off
you
are
not
listening
to
me
oh
yes
i
am
listening
you
said
that
you
danced
why
are
you
so
serious
well
one
can
not
always
be
but
you
have
changed
tremendously
since
woloda
and
i
first
went
to
moscow
tell
me
the
truth
now
why
are
you
so
odd
my
tone
was
resolute
am
i
so
odd
said
katenka
with
an
animation
which
showed
me
that
my
question
had
interested
her
i
don
t
see
that
i
am
so
at
well
you
are
not
the
same
as
you
were
before
i
continued
once
upon
a
time
any
one
could
see
that
you
were
our
equal
in
everything
and
that
you
loved
us
like
relations
just
as
we
did
you
but
now
you
are
always
serious
and
keep
yourself
apart
from
oh
not
at
but
let
me
finish
please
i
interrupted
already
conscious
of
a
slight
tickling
in
my
nose
the
precursor
of
the
tears
which
usually
came
to
my
eyes
whenever
i
had
to
vent
any
long
feeling
you
avoid
us
and
talk
to
no
one
but
mimi
as
though
you
had
no
wish
for
our
further
but
one
can
not
always
remain
the
same
one
must
change
a
little
sometimes
replied
katenka
who
had
an
inveterate
habit
of
pleading
some
such
fatalistic
necessity
whenever
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
say
i
recollect
that
once
when
having
a
quarrel
with
lubotshka
who
had
called
her
a
stupid
girl
she
katenka
retorted
that
everybody
could
not
be
wise
seeing
that
a
certain
number
of
stupid
people
was
a
necessity
in
the
world
however
on
the
present
occasion
i
was
not
satisfied
that
any
such
inevitable
necessity
for
changing
sometimes
existed
and
asked
further
why
is
it
necessary
well
you
see
we
may
not
always
go
on
living
together
as
we
are
doing
now
said
katenka
colouring
slightly
and
regarding
philip
s
back
with
a
grave
expression
on
her
face
my
mamma
was
able
to
live
with
your
mother
because
she
was
her
friend
but
will
a
similar
arrangement
always
suit
the
countess
who
they
say
is
so
easily
offended
besides
in
any
case
we
shall
have
to
separate
some
day
you
are
rich
you
have
petrovskoe
while
we
are
poor
mamma
has
you
are
rich
we
are
poor
both
the
words
and
the
ideas
which
they
connoted
seemed
to
me
extremely
strange
hitherto
i
had
conceived
that
only
beggars
and
peasants
were
poor
and
could
not
reconcile
in
my
mind
the
idea
of
poverty
and
the
graceful
charming
katenka
i
felt
that
mimi
and
her
daughter
ought
to
live
with
us
always
and
to
share
everything
that
we
possessed
things
ought
never
to
be
otherwise
yet
at
this
moment
a
thousand
new
thoughts
with
regard
to
their
lonely
position
came
crowding
into
my
head
and
i
felt
so
remorseful
at
the
notion
that
we
were
rich
and
they
poor
that
i
coloured
up
and
could
not
look
katenka
in
the
face
yet
what
does
it
matter
i
thought
that
we
are
well
off
and
they
are
not
why
should
that
necessitate
a
separation
why
should
we
not
share
in
common
what
we
possess
yet
i
had
a
feeling
that
i
could
not
talk
to
katenka
on
the
subject
since
a
certain
practical
instinct
opposed
to
all
logical
reasoning
warned
me
that
right
though
she
possibly
was
i
should
do
wrong
to
tell
her
so
it
is
impossible
that
you
should
leave
us
how
could
we
ever
live
apart
yet
what
else
is
there
to
be
done
certainly
i
do
not
want
to
do
it
yet
if
it
has
to
be
done
i
know
what
my
plan
in
life
will
yes
to
become
an
actress
how
absurd
i
exclaimed
for
i
knew
that
to
enter
that
profession
had
always
been
her
favourite
dream
oh
no
i
only
used
to
say
that
when
i
was
a
little
well
then
what
to
go
into
a
convent
and
live
there
then
i
could
walk
out
in
a
black
dress
and
velvet
cap
cried
katenka
has
it
ever
befallen
you
my
readers
to
become
suddenly
aware
that
your
conception
of
things
has
altered
as
though
every
object
in
life
had
unexpectedly
turned
a
side
towards
you
of
which
you
had
hitherto
remained
unaware
such
a
species
of
moral
change
occurred
as
regards
myself
during
this
journey
and
therefore
from
it
i
date
the
beginning
of
my
boyhood
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
then
envisaged
the
idea
that
we
our
family
were
not
the
only
persons
in
the
world
that
not
every
conceivable
interest
was
centred
in
ourselves
and
that
there
existed
numbers
of
people
who
had
nothing
in
common
with
us
cared
nothing
for
us
and
even
knew
nothing
of
our
existence
no
doubt
i
had
known
all
this
before
only
i
had
not
known
it
then
as
i
knew
it
now
i
had
never
properly
felt
or
understood
it
thought
merges
into
conviction
through
paths
of
its
own
as
well
as
sometimes
with
great
suddenness
and
by
methods
wholly
different
from
those
which
have
brought
other
intellects
to
the
same
conclusion
for
me
the
conversation
with
katenka
striking
deeply
as
it
did
and
forcing
me
to
reflect
on
her
future
position
constituted
such
a
path
as
i
gazed
at
the
towns
and
villages
through
which
we
passed
and
in
each
house
of
which
lived
at
least
one
family
like
our
own
as
well
as
at
the
women
and
children
who
stared
with
curiosity
at
our
carriages
and
then
became
lost
to
sight
for
ever
and
the
peasants
and
workmen
who
did
not
even
look
at
us
much
less
make
us
any
obeisance
the
question
arose
for
the
first
time
in
my
thoughts
whom
else
do
they
care
for
if
not
for
us
and
this
question
was
followed
by
others
such
as
to
what
end
do
they
live
how
do
they
educate
their
children
do
they
teach
their
children
and
let
them
play
what
are
their
names
and
so
forth
iv
in
moscow
from
the
time
of
our
arrival
in
moscow
the
change
in
my
conception
of
objects
of
persons
and
of
my
connection
with
them
became
increasingly
perceptible
when
at
my
first
meeting
with
grandmamma
i
saw
her
thin
wrinkled
face
and
faded
eyes
the
mingled
respect
and
fear
with
which
she
had
hitherto
inspired
me
gave
place
to
compassion
and
when
laying
her
cheek
against
lubotshka
s
head
she
sobbed
as
though
she
saw
before
her
the
corpse
of
her
beloved
daughter
my
compassion
grew
to
love
i
felt
deeply
sorry
to
see
her
grief
at
our
meeting
even
though
i
knew
that
in
ourselves
we
represented
nothing
in
her
eyes
but
were
dear
to
her
only
as
reminders
of
our
mother
that
every
kiss
which
she
imprinted
upon
my
cheeks
expressed
the
one
thought
she
is
no
more
she
is
dead
and
i
shall
never
see
her
papa
who
took
little
notice
of
us
here
in
moscow
and
whose
face
was
perpetually
preoccupied
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
came
in
his
black
to
take
formal
dinner
with
us
lost
much
in
my
eyes
at
this
period
in
spite
of
his
ruffles
robes
de
chambre
overseers
bailiffs
expeditions
to
the
estate
and
hunting
exploits
karl
ivanitch
whom
grandmamma
always
called
uncle
and
who
heaven
knows
why
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
adorn
the
bald
pate
of
my
childhood
s
days
with
a
red
wig
parted
in
the
middle
now
looked
to
me
so
strange
and
ridiculous
that
i
wondered
how
i
could
ever
have
failed
to
observe
the
fact
before
even
between
the
girls
and
ourselves
there
seemed
to
have
sprung
up
an
invisible
barrier
they
too
began
to
have
secrets
among
themselves
as
well
as
to
evince
a
desire
to
show
off
their
skirts
even
as
we
boys
did
our
trousers
and
as
for
mimi
she
appeared
at
luncheon
the
first
sunday
in
such
a
gorgeous
dress
and
with
so
many
ribbons
in
her
cap
that
it
was
clear
that
we
were
no
longer
en
campagne
and
that
everything
was
now
going
to
be
different
my
elder
brother
i
was
only
a
year
and
some
odd
months
younger
than
woloda
and
from
the
first
we
had
grown
up
and
studied
and
played
together
hitherto
the
difference
between
elder
and
younger
brother
had
never
been
felt
between
us
but
at
the
period
of
which
i
am
speaking
i
began
to
have
a
notion
that
i
was
not
woloda
s
equal
either
in
years
in
tastes
or
in
capabilities
i
even
began
to
fancy
that
woloda
himself
was
aware
of
his
superiority
and
that
he
was
proud
of
it
and
though
perhaps
i
was
wrong
the
idea
wounded
my
conceit
already
suffering
from
frequent
comparison
with
him
he
was
my
superior
in
everything
in
games
in
studies
in
quarrels
and
in
deportment
all
this
brought
about
an
estrangement
between
us
and
occasioned
me
moral
sufferings
which
i
had
never
hitherto
experienced
when
for
the
first
time
woloda
wore
dutch
pleated
shirts
i
at
once
said
that
i
was
greatly
put
out
at
not
being
given
similar
ones
and
each
time
that
he
arranged
his
collar
i
felt
that
he
was
doing
so
on
purpose
to
offend
me
but
what
tormented
me
most
of
all
was
the
idea
that
woloda
could
see
through
me
yet
did
not
choose
to
show
it
who
has
not
known
those
secret
wordless
communications
which
spring
from
some
barely
perceptible
smile
or
movement
from
a
casual
glance
between
two
persons
who
live
as
constantly
together
as
do
brothers
friends
man
and
wife
or
master
and
servant
particularly
if
those
two
persons
do
not
in
all
things
cultivate
mutual
frankness
how
many
wishes
thoughts
and
meanings
which
one
shrinks
from
revealing
are
made
plain
by
a
single
accidental
glance
which
timidly
and
irresolutely
meets
the
eye
however
in
my
own
case
i
may
have
been
deceived
by
my
excessive
capacity
for
and
love
of
analysis
possibly
woloda
did
not
feel
at
all
as
i
did
passionate
and
frank
but
unstable
in
his
likings
he
was
attracted
by
the
most
diverse
things
and
always
surrendered
himself
wholly
to
such
attraction
for
instance
he
suddenly
conceived
a
passion
for
pictures
spent
all
his
money
on
their
purchase
begged
papa
grandmamma
and
his
drawing
master
to
add
to
their
number
and
applied
himself
with
enthusiasm
to
art
next
came
a
sudden
rage
for
curios
with
which
he
covered
his
table
and
for
which
he
ransacked
the
whole
house
following
upon
that
he
took
to
violent
procuring
such
works
by
stealth
and
devouring
them
day
and
night
involuntarily
i
was
influenced
by
his
whims
for
though
too
proud
to
imitate
him
i
was
also
too
young
and
too
lacking
in
independence
to
choose
my
own
way
above
all
i
envied
woloda
his
happy
nobly
frank
character
which
showed
itself
most
strikingly
when
we
quarrelled
i
always
felt
that
he
was
in
the
right
yet
could
not
imitate
him
for
instance
on
one
occasion
when
his
passion
for
curios
was
at
its
height
i
went
to
his
table
and
accidentally
broke
an
empty
who
gave
you
leave
to
touch
my
things
asked
woloda
chancing
to
enter
the
room
at
that
moment
and
at
once
perceiving
the
disorder
which
i
had
occasioned
in
the
orderly
arrangement
of
the
treasures
on
his
table
and
where
is
that
smelling
bottle
perhaps
you
i
let
it
fall
and
it
smashed
to
pieces
but
what
does
that
matter
well
please
do
me
the
favour
never
to
dare
to
touch
my
things
again
he
said
as
he
gathered
up
the
broken
fragments
and
looked
at
them
vexedly
and
will
you
please
do
me
the
favour
never
to
order
me
to
do
anything
whatever
i
retorted
when
a
thing
s
broken
it
s
broken
and
there
is
no
more
to
be
then
i
smiled
though
i
hardly
felt
like
smiling
oh
it
may
mean
nothing
to
you
but
to
me
it
means
a
good
deal
said
woloda
shrugging
his
shoulders
a
habit
he
had
caught
from
papa
first
of
all
you
go
and
break
my
things
and
then
you
laugh
what
a
nuisance
a
little
boy
can
be
little
boy
indeed
then
you
i
suppose
are
a
man
and
ever
so
wise
i
do
not
intend
to
quarrel
with
you
said
woloda
giving
me
a
slight
push
go
don
t
you
push
me
go
i
say
again
don
t
you
push
me
woloda
took
me
by
the
hand
and
tried
to
drag
me
away
from
the
table
but
i
was
excited
to
the
last
degree
and
gave
the
table
such
a
push
with
my
foot
that
i
upset
the
whole
concern
and
brought
china
and
crystal
ornaments
and
everything
else
with
a
crash
to
the
floor
you
disgusting
little
brute
exclaimed
woloda
trying
to
save
some
of
his
falling
treasures
at
last
all
is
over
between
us
i
thought
to
myself
as
i
strode
from
the
room
we
are
separated
now
for
it
was
not
until
evening
that
we
again
exchanged
a
word
yet
i
felt
guilty
and
was
afraid
to
look
at
him
and
remained
at
a
loose
end
all
day
woloda
on
the
contrary
did
his
lessons
as
diligently
as
ever
and
passed
the
time
after
luncheon
in
talking
and
laughing
with
the
girls
as
soon
again
as
afternoon
lessons
were
over
i
left
the
room
for
it
would
have
been
terribly
embarrassing
for
me
to
be
alone
with
my
brother
when
too
the
evening
class
in
history
was
ended
i
took
my
notebook
and
moved
towards
the
door
just
as
i
passed
woloda
i
pouted
and
pulled
an
angry
face
though
in
reality
i
should
have
liked
to
have
made
my
peace
with
him
at
the
same
moment
he
lifted
his
head
and
with
a
barely
perceptible
and
satirical
smile
looked
me
full
in
the
face
our
eyes
met
and
i
saw
that
he
understood
me
while
he
for
his
part
saw
that
i
knew
that
he
understood
me
yet
a
feeling
stronger
than
myself
obliged
me
to
turn
away
from
him
nicolinka
he
said
in
a
perfectly
simple
and
anything
but
way
you
have
been
angry
with
me
long
enough
i
am
sorry
if
i
offended
you
and
he
tendered
me
his
hand
it
was
as
though
something
welled
up
from
my
heart
and
nearly
choked
me
presently
it
passed
away
the
tears
rushed
to
my
eyes
and
i
felt
immensely
relieved
i
too
am
i
said
taking
his
hand
yet
he
only
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
as
though
he
could
not
understand
why
there
should
be
tears
in
my
eyes
vi
masha
none
of
the
changes
produced
in
my
conception
of
things
were
so
striking
as
the
one
which
led
me
to
cease
to
see
in
one
of
our
chambermaids
a
mere
servant
of
the
female
sex
but
on
the
contrary
a
woman
upon
whom
depended
to
a
certain
extent
my
peace
of
mind
and
happiness
from
the
time
of
my
earliest
recollection
i
can
remember
masha
an
inmate
of
our
house
yet
never
until
the
occurrence
of
which
i
am
going
to
speak
an
occurrence
which
entirely
altered
my
impression
of
her
had
i
bestowed
the
smallest
attention
upon
her
she
was
years
old
while
i
was
but
fourteen
also
she
was
very
beautiful
but
i
hesitate
to
give
a
further
description
of
her
lest
my
imagination
should
once
more
picture
the
bewitching
though
deceptive
conception
of
her
which
filled
my
mind
during
the
period
of
my
passion
to
be
frank
i
will
only
say
that
she
was
extraordinarily
handsome
magnificently
developed
and
a
woman
as
also
that
i
was
but
fourteen
at
one
of
those
moments
when
in
hand
i
would
pace
the
room
and
try
to
keep
strictly
to
one
particular
crack
in
the
floor
as
i
hummed
a
fragment
of
some
tune
or
repeated
some
vague
formula
in
short
at
one
of
those
moments
when
the
mind
leaves
off
thinking
and
the
imagination
gains
the
upper
hand
and
yearns
for
new
impressions
i
left
the
schoolroom
and
turned
with
no
definite
purpose
in
view
towards
the
head
of
the
staircase
somebody
in
slippers
was
ascending
the
second
flight
of
stairs
of
course
i
felt
curious
to
see
who
it
was
but
the
footsteps
ceased
abruptly
and
then
i
heard
masha
s
voice
say
go
away
what
nonsense
what
would
maria
ivanovna
think
if
she
were
to
come
now
oh
but
she
will
not
come
answered
woloda
s
voice
in
a
whisper
well
go
away
you
silly
boy
and
masha
came
running
up
and
fled
past
me
i
can
not
describe
the
way
in
which
this
discovery
confounded
me
nevertheless
the
feeling
of
amazement
soon
gave
place
to
a
kind
of
sympathy
with
woloda
s
conduct
i
found
myself
wondering
less
at
the
conduct
itself
than
at
his
ability
to
behave
so
agreeably
also
i
found
myself
involuntarily
desiring
to
imitate
him
sometimes
i
would
pace
the
landing
for
an
hour
at
a
time
with
no
other
thought
in
my
head
than
to
watch
for
movements
from
above
yet
although
i
longed
beyond
all
things
to
do
as
woloda
had
done
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
the
point
at
other
times
filled
with
a
sense
of
envious
jealousy
i
would
conceal
myself
behind
a
door
and
listen
to
the
sounds
which
came
from
the
maidservants
room
until
the
thought
would
occur
to
my
mind
how
if
i
were
to
go
in
now
and
like
woloda
kiss
masha
what
should
i
say
when
she
asked
me
me
with
the
huge
nose
and
the
tuft
on
the
top
of
my
head
what
i
wanted
sometimes
too
i
could
hear
her
saying
to
woloda
that
serves
you
right
go
away
nicolas
petrovitch
never
comes
in
here
with
such
alas
she
did
not
know
that
nicolas
petrovitch
was
sitting
on
the
staircase
just
below
and
feeling
that
he
would
give
all
he
possessed
to
be
in
that
bold
fellow
woloda
s
place
i
was
shy
by
nature
and
rendered
worse
in
that
respect
by
a
consciousness
of
my
own
ugliness
i
am
certain
that
nothing
so
much
influences
the
development
of
a
man
as
his
exterior
though
the
exterior
itself
less
than
his
belief
in
its
plainness
or
beauty
yet
i
was
too
conceited
altogether
to
resign
myself
to
my
fate
i
tried
to
comfort
myself
much
as
the
fox
did
when
he
declared
that
the
grapes
were
sour
that
is
to
say
i
tried
to
make
light
of
the
satisfaction
to
be
gained
from
making
such
use
of
a
pleasing
exterior
as
i
believed
woloda
to
employ
satisfaction
which
i
nevertheless
envied
him
from
my
heart
and
endeavoured
with
every
faculty
of
my
intellect
and
imagination
to
console
myself
with
a
pride
in
my
isolation
vii
small
shot
good
gracious
powder
exclaimed
mimi
in
a
voice
trembling
with
alarm
whatever
are
you
doing
you
will
set
the
house
on
fire
in
a
moment
and
be
the
death
of
us
all
upon
that
with
an
indescribable
expression
of
firmness
mimi
ordered
every
one
to
stand
aside
and
regardless
of
all
possible
danger
from
a
premature
explosion
strode
with
long
and
resolute
steps
to
where
some
small
shot
was
scattered
about
the
floor
and
began
to
trample
upon
it
when
in
her
opinion
the
peril
was
at
least
lessened
she
called
for
michael
and
commanded
him
to
throw
the
powder
away
into
some
remote
spot
or
better
still
to
immerse
it
in
water
after
which
she
adjusted
her
cap
and
returned
proudly
to
the
murmuring
as
she
went
at
least
i
can
say
that
they
are
well
looked
when
papa
issued
from
his
room
and
took
us
to
see
grandmamma
we
found
mimi
sitting
by
the
window
and
glancing
with
a
grave
mysterious
official
expression
towards
the
door
in
her
hand
she
was
holding
something
carefully
wrapped
in
paper
i
guessed
that
that
something
was
the
small
shot
and
that
grandmamma
had
been
informed
of
the
occurrence
in
the
room
also
were
the
maidservant
gasha
who
to
judge
by
her
angry
flushed
face
was
in
a
state
of
great
irritation
and
doctor
blumenthal
the
latter
a
little
man
pitted
with
smallpox
who
was
endeavouring
by
tacit
pacificatory
signs
with
his
head
and
eyes
to
reassure
the
perturbed
gasha
grandmamma
was
sitting
a
little
askew
and
playing
that
variety
of
patience
which
is
called
the
traveller
two
unmistakable
signs
of
her
displeasure
how
are
you
mamma
said
papa
as
he
kissed
her
hand
respectfully
have
you
had
a
good
night
yes
very
good
my
dear
you
know
that
i
always
enjoy
sound
health
replied
grandmamma
in
a
tone
implying
that
papa
s
inquiries
were
out
of
place
and
highly
offensive
please
give
me
a
clean
she
added
to
gasha
i
have
given
you
one
madam
answered
gasha
pointing
to
the
cambric
handkerchief
which
she
had
just
laid
on
the
arm
of
grandmamma
s
chair
no
no
it
s
a
nasty
dirty
thing
take
it
away
and
bring
me
a
clean
one
my
gasha
went
to
a
cupboard
and
slammed
the
door
of
it
back
so
violently
that
every
window
rattled
grandmamma
glared
angrily
at
each
of
us
and
then
turned
her
attention
to
following
the
movements
of
the
servant
after
the
latter
had
presented
her
with
what
i
suspected
to
be
the
same
handkerchief
as
before
grandmamma
continued
and
when
do
you
mean
to
cut
me
some
snuff
my
dear
when
i
have
what
do
you
say
if
you
don
t
want
to
continue
in
my
service
you
had
better
say
so
at
once
i
would
have
sent
you
away
long
ago
had
i
known
that
you
wished
it
wouldn
t
have
broken
my
heart
if
you
had
muttered
the
woman
in
an
undertone
here
the
doctor
winked
at
her
again
but
she
returned
his
gaze
so
firmly
and
wrathfully
that
he
soon
lowered
it
and
went
on
playing
with
his
you
see
my
dear
how
people
speak
to
me
in
my
own
house
said
grandmamma
to
papa
when
gasha
had
left
the
room
grumbling
well
mamma
i
will
cut
you
some
snuff
myself
replied
papa
though
evidently
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
now
that
he
had
made
this
rash
promise
no
no
i
thank
you
probably
she
is
cross
because
she
knows
that
no
one
except
herself
can
cut
the
snuff
just
as
i
like
it
do
you
know
my
dear
she
went
on
after
a
pause
that
your
children
very
nearly
set
the
house
on
fire
this
morning
papa
gazed
at
grandmamma
with
respectful
astonishment
yes
they
were
playing
with
something
or
another
tell
him
the
story
she
added
to
mimi
papa
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
took
the
shot
in
his
hand
this
is
only
small
shot
mamma
he
remarked
and
could
never
be
i
thank
you
my
dear
for
your
instruction
but
i
am
rather
too
old
for
that
sort
of
nerves
nerves
whispered
the
doctor
papa
turned
to
us
and
asked
us
where
we
had
got
the
stuff
and
how
we
could
dare
to
play
with
it
don
t
ask
them
ask
that
useless
uncle
rather
put
in
grandmamma
laying
a
peculiar
stress
upon
the
word
what
else
is
he
for
woloda
says
that
karl
ivanitch
gave
him
the
powder
himself
declared
mimi
then
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
use
he
is
continued
grandmamma
and
where
is
he
this
precious
uncle
how
is
one
to
get
hold
of
him
send
him
he
has
gone
an
errand
for
me
said
papa
that
is
not
at
all
right
rejoined
grandmamma
he
ought
always
to
be
here
true
the
children
are
yours
not
mine
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
seeing
that
you
are
so
much
cleverer
than
i
am
yet
all
the
same
i
think
it
is
time
we
had
a
regular
tutor
for
them
and
not
this
uncle
of
a
german
a
stupid
fellow
who
knows
only
how
to
teach
them
rude
manners
and
tyrolean
songs
is
it
necessary
i
ask
you
that
they
should
learn
tyrolean
songs
however
there
is
no
one
for
me
to
consult
about
it
and
you
must
do
just
as
you
the
word
now
meant
now
that
they
have
no
mother
and
suddenly
awakened
sad
recollections
in
grandmamma
s
heart
she
threw
a
glance
at
the
bearing
mamma
s
portrait
and
sighed
i
thought
of
all
this
long
ago
said
papa
eagerly
as
well
as
taking
your
advice
on
the
subject
how
would
you
like
jerome
to
superintend
their
lessons
oh
i
think
he
would
do
excellently
my
friend
said
grandmamma
in
a
mollified
tone
he
is
at
least
a
tutor
comme
il
faut
and
knows
how
to
instruct
des
enfants
de
bonne
maison
he
is
not
a
mere
uncle
who
is
good
only
for
taking
them
out
very
well
i
will
talk
to
him
said
papa
and
sure
enough
two
days
later
saw
karl
ivanitch
forced
to
retire
in
favour
of
the
young
frenchman
referred
to
viii
karl
ivanitch
s
history
the
evening
before
the
day
when
karl
was
to
leave
us
for
ever
he
was
standing
clad
as
usual
in
his
wadded
and
red
cap
near
the
bed
in
his
room
and
bending
down
over
a
trunk
as
he
carefully
packed
his
belongings
his
behaviour
towards
us
had
been
very
cool
of
late
and
he
had
seemed
to
shrink
from
all
contact
with
us
consequently
when
i
entered
his
room
on
the
present
occasion
he
only
glanced
at
me
for
a
second
and
then
went
on
with
his
occupation
even
though
i
proceeded
to
jump
on
to
his
bed
a
thing
hitherto
always
forbidden
me
to
do
he
said
not
a
word
and
the
idea
that
he
would
soon
be
scolding
or
forgiving
us
no
longer
no
longer
having
anything
to
do
with
us
reminded
me
vividly
of
the
impending
separation
i
felt
grieved
to
think
that
he
had
ceased
to
love
us
and
wanted
to
show
him
my
grief
will
you
let
me
help
you
i
said
approaching
him
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
turned
away
again
yet
the
expression
of
pain
in
his
eyes
showed
that
his
coldness
was
not
the
result
of
indifference
but
rather
of
sincere
and
concentrated
sorrow
god
sees
and
knows
everything
he
said
at
length
raising
himself
to
his
full
height
and
drawing
a
deep
sigh
yes
nicolinka
he
went
on
observing
the
expression
of
sincere
pity
on
my
face
my
fate
has
been
an
unhappy
one
from
the
cradle
and
will
continue
so
to
the
grave
the
good
that
i
have
done
to
people
has
always
been
repaid
with
evil
yet
though
i
shall
receive
no
reward
here
i
shall
find
one
there
he
pointed
upwards
ah
if
only
you
knew
my
whole
story
and
all
that
i
have
endured
in
this
life
i
who
have
been
a
bootmaker
a
soldier
a
deserter
a
factory
hand
and
a
teacher
yet
now
now
i
am
nothing
and
like
the
son
of
man
have
nowhere
to
lay
my
sitting
down
upon
a
chair
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
seeing
that
he
was
in
the
introspective
mood
in
which
a
man
pays
no
attention
to
his
listener
as
he
cons
over
his
secret
thoughts
i
remained
silent
and
seating
myself
upon
the
bed
continued
to
watch
his
kind
face
you
are
no
longer
a
child
you
can
understand
things
now
and
i
will
tell
you
my
whole
story
and
all
that
i
have
undergone
some
day
my
children
you
may
remember
the
old
friend
who
loved
you
so
much
he
leant
his
elbow
upon
the
table
by
his
side
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
in
the
peculiarly
measured
guttural
tone
in
which
he
used
to
dictate
us
our
lessons
began
the
story
of
his
career
since
he
many
times
in
later
years
repeated
the
whole
to
me
again
always
in
the
same
order
and
with
the
same
expressions
and
the
same
unvarying
intonation
i
will
try
to
render
it
literally
and
without
omitting
the
innumerable
grammatical
errors
into
which
he
always
strayed
when
speaking
in
russian
whether
it
was
really
the
history
of
his
life
or
whether
it
was
the
mere
product
of
his
imagination
that
is
to
say
some
narrative
which
he
had
conceived
during
his
lonely
residence
in
our
house
and
had
at
last
from
endless
repetition
come
to
believe
in
himself
or
whether
he
was
adorning
with
imaginary
facts
the
true
record
of
his
career
i
have
never
quite
been
able
to
make
out
on
the
one
hand
there
was
too
much
depth
of
feeling
and
practical
consistency
in
its
recital
for
it
to
be
wholly
incredible
while
on
the
other
hand
the
abundance
of
poetical
beauty
which
it
contained
tended
to
raise
doubts
in
the
mind
of
the
listener

xi
one
mark
only
the
year
of
mourning
over
grandmamma
recovered
a
little
from
her
grief
and
once
more
took
to
receiving
occasional
guests
especially
children
of
the
same
age
as
ourselves
on
the
of
december
lubotshka
s
birthday
the
princess
kornakoff
and
her
daughters
with
madame
valakhin
sonetchka
ilinka
grap
and
the
two
younger
iwins
arrived
at
our
house
before
luncheon
though
we
could
hear
the
sounds
of
talking
laughter
and
movements
going
on
in
the
we
could
not
join
the
party
until
our
morning
lessons
were
finished
the
table
of
studies
in
the
schoolroom
said
lundi
de
a
maitre
d
histoire
et
de
geographie
and
this
infernal
maitre
d
histoire
we
must
await
listen
to
and
see
the
back
of
before
we
could
gain
our
liberty
already
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
two
and
nothing
was
to
be
heard
of
the
tutor
nor
yet
anything
to
be
seen
of
him
in
the
street
although
i
kept
looking
up
and
down
it
with
the
greatest
impatience
and
with
an
emphatic
longing
never
to
see
the
maitre
again
i
believe
he
is
not
coming
said
woloda
looking
up
for
a
moment
from
his
i
hope
he
is
not
please
the
lord
i
answered
but
in
a
despondent
tone
yet
there
he
does
come
i
believe
all
the
same
not
he
why
that
is
a
gentleman
said
woloda
likewise
looking
out
of
the
window
let
us
wait
till
two
and
then
ask
jerome
if
we
may
put
away
our
yes
and
wish
them
au
revoir
i
added
stretching
my
arms
with
the
book
clasped
in
my
hands
over
my
head
having
hitherto
idled
away
my
time
i
now
opened
the
book
at
the
place
where
the
lesson
was
to
begin
and
started
to
learn
it
it
was
long
and
difficult
and
moreover
i
was
in
the
mood
when
one
s
thoughts
refuse
to
be
arrested
by
anything
at
all
consequently
i
made
no
progress
after
our
last
lesson
in
history
which
always
seemed
to
me
a
peculiarly
arduous
and
wearisome
subject
the
history
master
had
complained
to
jerome
of
me
because
only
two
good
marks
stood
to
my
credit
in
the
register
a
very
small
total
jerome
had
then
told
me
that
if
i
failed
to
gain
less
than
three
marks
at
the
next
lesson
i
should
be
severely
punished
the
next
lesson
was
now
imminent
and
i
confess
that
i
felt
a
little
nervous
so
absorbed
however
did
i
become
in
my
reading
that
the
sound
of
goloshes
being
taken
off
in
the
came
upon
me
almost
as
a
shock
i
had
just
time
to
look
up
when
there
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
servile
and
to
me
very
disgusting
face
and
form
of
the
master
clad
in
a
blue
frockcoat
with
brass
buttons
slowly
he
set
down
his
hat
and
books
and
adjusted
the
folds
of
his
coat
as
though
such
a
thing
were
necessary
and
seated
himself
in
his
place
well
gentlemen
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
let
us
first
of
all
repeat
the
general
contents
of
the
last
lesson
after
which
i
will
proceed
to
narrate
the
succeeding
events
of
the
middle
this
meant
say
over
the
last
while
woloda
was
answering
the
master
with
the
entire
ease
and
confidence
which
come
of
knowing
a
subject
well
i
went
aimlessly
out
on
to
the
landing
and
since
i
was
not
allowed
to
go
downstairs
what
more
natural
than
that
i
should
involuntarily
turn
towards
the
alcove
on
the
landing
yet
before
i
had
time
to
establish
myself
in
my
usual
coign
of
vantage
behind
the
door
i
found
myself
pounced
upon
by
mimi
always
the
cause
of
my
misfortunes
you
here
she
said
looking
severely
first
at
myself
and
then
at
the
maidservants
door
and
then
at
myself
again
i
felt
thoroughly
guilty
firstly
because
i
was
not
in
the
schoolroom
and
secondly
because
i
was
in
a
forbidden
place
so
i
remained
silent
and
dropping
my
head
assumed
a
touching
expression
of
contrition
indeed
this
is
too
bad
mimi
went
on
what
are
you
doing
here
still
i
said
nothing
well
it
shall
not
rest
where
it
is
she
added
tapping
the
banister
with
her
yellow
fingers
i
shall
inform
the
it
was
five
minutes
to
three
when
i
the
schoolroom
the
master
as
though
oblivious
of
my
presence
or
absence
was
explaining
the
new
lesson
to
woloda
when
he
had
finished
doing
this
and
had
put
his
books
together
while
woloda
went
into
the
other
room
to
fetch
his
ticket
the
comforting
idea
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
the
whole
thing
was
over
now
and
that
the
master
had
forgotten
me
but
suddenly
he
turned
in
my
direction
with
a
malicious
smile
and
said
as
he
rubbed
his
hands
anew
i
hope
you
have
learnt
your
lesson
yes
i
replied
would
you
be
so
kind
then
as
to
tell
me
something
about
louis
crusade
he
went
on
balancing
himself
on
his
chair
and
looking
gravely
at
his
feet
firstly
tell
me
something
about
the
reasons
which
induced
the
french
king
to
assume
the
cross
here
he
raised
his
eyebrows
and
pointed
to
the
inkstand
then
explain
to
me
the
general
characteristics
of
the
crusade
here
he
made
a
sweeping
gesture
with
his
hand
as
though
to
seize
hold
of
something
with
it
and
lastly
expound
to
me
the
influence
of
this
crusade
upon
the
european
states
in
general
drawing
the
copy
books
to
the
left
side
of
the
table
and
upon
the
french
state
in
particular
drawing
one
of
them
to
the
right
and
inclining
his
head
in
the
same
direction
i
swallowed
a
few
times
coughed
bent
forward
and
was
silent
then
taking
a
pen
from
the
table
i
began
to
pick
it
to
pieces
yet
still
said
nothing
allow
me
the
pen
i
shall
want
it
said
the
master
well
louis
very
good
and
wise
what
king
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
to
jerusalem
and
handed
over
the
reins
of
government
to
his
what
was
her
name
what
belanka
i
laughed
in
a
rather
forced
manner
well
is
that
all
you
know
he
asked
again
smiling
i
had
nothing
to
lose
now
so
i
began
chattering
the
first
thing
that
came
into
my
head
the
master
remained
silent
as
he
gathered
together
the
remains
of
the
pen
which
i
had
left
strewn
about
the
table
looked
gravely
past
my
ear
at
the
wall
and
repeated
from
time
to
time
very
well
very
though
i
was
conscious
that
i
knew
nothing
whatever
and
was
expressing
myself
all
wrong
i
felt
much
hurt
at
the
fact
that
he
never
either
corrected
or
interrupted
me
what
made
him
think
of
going
to
jerusalem
he
asked
at
last
repeating
some
words
of
my
own
because
because
that
is
to
say
my
confusion
was
complete
and
i
relapsed
into
silence
i
felt
that
even
if
this
disgusting
history
master
were
to
go
on
putting
questions
to
me
and
gazing
inquiringly
into
my
face
for
a
year
i
should
never
be
able
to
enunciate
another
syllable
after
staring
at
me
for
some
three
minutes
he
suddenly
assumed
a
mournful
cast
of
countenance
and
said
in
an
agitated
voice
to
woloda
who
was
just
the
room
allow
me
the
register
i
will
write
my
he
opened
the
book
thoughtfully
and
in
his
fine
caligraphy
marked
five
for
woloda
for
diligence
and
the
same
for
good
behaviour
then
resting
his
pen
on
the
line
where
my
report
was
to
go
he
looked
at
me
and
reflected
suddenly
his
hand
made
a
decisive
movement
and
behold
against
my
name
stood
a
one
with
a
full
stop
after
it
another
movement
and
in
the
behaviour
column
there
stood
another
one
and
another
full
stop
quietly
closing
the
book
the
master
then
rose
and
moved
towards
the
door
as
though
unconscious
of
my
look
of
entreaty
despair
and
reproach
michael
lavionitch
i
said
no
he
replied
as
though
knowing
beforehand
what
i
was
about
to
say
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
learn
in
that
way
i
am
not
going
to
earn
my
money
for
he
put
on
his
goloshes
and
cloak
and
then
slowly
tied
a
scarf
about
his
neck
to
think
that
he
could
care
about
such
trifles
after
what
had
just
happened
to
me
to
him
it
was
all
a
mere
stroke
of
the
pen
but
to
me
it
meant
the
direst
misfortune
is
the
lesson
over
asked
jerome
entering
and
was
the
master
pleased
with
you
how
many
marks
did
he
give
you
and
to
nicholas
i
was
silent
i
think
four
said
woloda
his
idea
was
to
save
me
for
at
least
today
if
punishment
there
must
be
it
need
not
be
awarded
while
we
had
guests
voyons
messieurs
jerome
was
forever
saying
voyons
faites
votre
toilette
et
xii
the
key
we
had
hardly
descended
and
greeted
our
guests
when
luncheon
was
announced
papa
was
in
the
highest
of
spirits
since
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
winning
he
had
presented
lubotshka
with
a
silver
tea
service
and
suddenly
remembered
after
luncheon
that
he
had
forgotten
a
box
of
bonbons
which
she
was
to
have
too
why
send
a
servant
for
it
you
had
better
go
koko
he
said
to
me
jestingly
the
keys
are
in
the
tray
on
the
table
you
know
take
them
and
with
the
largest
one
open
the
second
drawer
on
the
right
there
you
will
find
the
box
of
bonbons
bring
it
shall
i
get
you
some
cigars
as
well
said
i
knowing
that
he
always
smoked
after
luncheon
yes
do
but
don
t
touch
anything
i
found
the
keys
and
was
about
to
carry
out
my
orders
when
i
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
know
what
the
smallest
of
the
keys
on
the
bunch
belonged
to
on
the
table
i
saw
among
many
other
things
a
padlocked
portfolio
and
at
once
felt
curious
to
see
if
that
was
what
the
key
fitted
my
experiment
was
crowned
with
success
the
portfolio
opened
and
disclosed
a
number
of
papers
curiosity
so
strongly
urged
me
also
to
ascertain
what
those
papers
contained
that
the
voice
of
conscience
was
stilled
and
i
began
to
read
their
contents
my
childish
feeling
of
unlimited
respect
for
my
elders
especially
for
papa
was
so
strong
within
me
that
my
intellect
involuntarily
refused
to
draw
any
conclusions
from
what
i
had
seen
i
felt
that
papa
was
living
in
a
sphere
completely
apart
from
incomprehensible
by
and
unattainable
for
me
as
well
as
one
that
was
in
every
way
excellent
and
that
any
attempt
on
my
part
to
criticise
the
secrets
of
his
life
would
constitute
something
like
sacrilege
for
this
reason
the
discovery
which
i
made
from
papa
s
portfolio
left
no
clear
impression
upon
my
mind
but
only
a
dim
consciousness
that
i
had
done
wrong
i
felt
ashamed
and
confused
the
feeling
made
me
eager
to
shut
the
portfolio
again
as
quickly
as
possible
but
it
seemed
as
though
on
this
unlucky
day
i
was
destined
to
experience
every
possible
kind
of
adversity
i
put
the
key
back
into
the
padlock
and
turned
it
round
but
not
in
the
right
direction
thinking
that
the
portfolio
was
now
locked
i
pulled
at
the
key
and
oh
horror
found
my
hand
come
away
with
only
the
top
half
of
the
key
in
it
in
vain
did
i
try
to
put
the
two
halves
together
and
to
extract
the
portion
that
was
sticking
in
the
padlock
at
last
i
had
to
resign
myself
to
the
dreadful
thought
that
i
had
committed
a
new
crime
one
which
would
be
discovered
as
soon
as
ever
papa
returned
to
his
study
first
of
all
mimi
s
accusation
on
the
staircase
and
then
that
one
mark
and
then
this
key
nothing
worse
could
happen
now
this
very
evening
i
should
be
assailed
successively
by
grandmamma
because
of
mimi
s
denunciation
by
jerome
because
of
the
solitary
mark
and
by
papa
because
of
the
matter
of
this
key
yes
all
in
one
evening
what
on
earth
is
to
become
of
me
what
have
i
done
i
exclaimed
as
i
paced
the
soft
carpet
well
i
went
on
with
sudden
determination
what
must
come
must
that
s
all
and
taking
up
the
bonbons
and
the
cigars
i
ran
back
to
the
other
part
of
the
house
the
fatalistic
formula
with
which
i
had
concluded
and
which
was
one
that
i
often
heard
nicola
utter
during
my
childhood
always
produced
in
me
at
the
more
difficult
crises
of
my
life
a
momentarily
soothing
beneficial
effect
consequently
when
i
the
i
was
in
a
rather
excited
unnatural
mood
yet
one
that
was
perfectly
cheerful
xiii
the
traitress
after
luncheon
we
began
to
play
at
round
games
in
which
i
took
a
lively
part
while
indulging
in
cat
and
mouse
i
happened
to
cannon
rather
awkwardly
against
the
kornakoffs
governess
who
was
playing
with
us
and
stepping
on
her
dress
tore
a
large
hole
in
it
seeing
that
the
girls
particularly
sonetchka
were
anything
but
displeased
at
the
spectacle
of
the
governess
angrily
departing
to
the
maidservants
room
to
have
her
dress
mended
i
resolved
to
procure
them
the
satisfaction
a
second
time
accordingly
in
pursuance
of
this
amiable
resolution
i
waited
until
my
victim
returned
and
then
began
to
gallop
madly
round
her
until
a
favourable
moment
occurred
for
once
more
planting
my
heel
upon
her
dress
and
reopening
the
rent
sonetchka
and
the
young
princesses
had
much
ado
to
restrain
their
laughter
which
excited
my
conceit
the
more
but
jerome
who
had
probably
divined
my
tricks
came
up
to
me
with
the
frown
which
i
could
never
abide
in
him
and
said
that
since
i
seemed
disposed
to
mischief
he
would
have
to
send
me
away
if
i
did
not
moderate
my
behaviour
however
i
was
in
the
desperate
position
of
a
person
who
having
staked
more
than
he
has
in
his
pocket
and
feeling
that
he
can
never
make
up
his
account
continues
to
plunge
on
unlucky
cards
not
because
he
hopes
to
regain
his
losses
but
because
it
will
not
do
for
him
to
stop
and
consider
so
i
merely
laughed
in
an
impudent
fashion
and
flung
away
from
my
monitor
after
cat
and
mouse
another
game
followed
in
which
the
gentlemen
sit
on
one
row
of
chairs
and
the
ladies
on
another
and
choose
each
other
for
partners
the
youngest
princess
always
chose
the
younger
iwin
katenka
either
woloda
or
ilinka
and
sonetchka
seriosha
nor
to
my
extreme
astonishment
did
sonetchka
seem
at
all
embarrassed
when
her
cavalier
went
and
sat
down
beside
her
on
the
contrary
she
only
laughed
her
sweet
musical
laugh
and
made
a
sign
with
her
head
that
he
had
chosen
right
since
nobody
chose
me
i
always
had
the
mortification
of
finding
myself
left
over
and
of
hearing
them
say
who
has
been
left
out
oh
nicolinka
well
do
take
him
consequently
whenever
it
came
to
my
turn
to
guess
who
had
chosen
me
i
had
to
go
either
to
my
sister
or
to
one
of
the
ugly
elder
princesses
sonetchka
seemed
so
absorbed
in
seriosha
that
in
her
eyes
i
clearly
existed
no
longer
i
do
not
quite
know
why
i
called
her
the
traitress
in
my
thoughts
since
she
had
never
promised
to
choose
me
instead
of
seriosha
but
for
all
that
i
felt
convinced
that
she
was
treating
me
in
a
very
abominable
fashion
after
the
game
was
finished
i
actually
saw
the
traitress
from
whom
i
nevertheless
could
not
withdraw
my
eyes
go
with
seriosha
and
katenka
into
a
corner
and
engage
in
secret
confabulation
stealing
softly
round
the
piano
which
masked
the
conclave
i
beheld
the
following
katenka
was
holding
up
a
by
two
of
its
corners
so
as
to
form
a
screen
for
the
heads
of
her
two
companions
no
you
have
lost
you
must
pay
the
forfeit
cried
seriosha
at
that
moment
and
sonetchka
who
was
standing
in
front
of
him
blushed
like
a
criminal
as
she
replied
no
i
have
not
lost
have
i
mademoiselle
katherine
well
i
must
speak
the
truth
answered
katenka
and
say
that
you
have
lost
my
scarcely
had
she
spoken
the
words
when
seriosha
embraced
sonetchka
and
kissed
her
right
on
her
rosy
lips
and
sonetchka
smiled
as
though
it
were
nothing
but
merely
something
very
pleasant
horrors
the
artful
traitress
xiv
the
retribution
instantly
i
began
to
feel
a
strong
contempt
for
the
female
sex
in
general
and
sonetchka
in
particular
i
began
to
think
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
amusing
in
these
games
that
they
were
only
fit
for
girls
and
felt
as
though
i
should
like
to
make
a
great
noise
or
to
do
something
of
such
extraordinary
boldness
that
every
one
would
be
forced
to
admire
it
the
opportunity
soon
arrived
jerome
said
something
to
mimi
and
then
left
the
room
i
could
hear
his
footsteps
ascending
the
staircase
and
then
passing
across
the
schoolroom
and
the
idea
occurred
to
me
that
mimi
must
have
told
him
her
story
about
my
being
found
on
the
landing
and
thereupon
he
had
gone
to
look
at
the
register
in
those
days
it
must
be
remembered
i
believed
that
jerome
s
whole
aim
in
life
was
to
annoy
me
some
where
i
have
read
that
not
infrequently
children
of
from
twelve
to
fourteen
years
of
age
that
is
to
say
children
just
passing
from
childhood
to
adolescence
are
addicted
to
incendiarism
or
even
to
murder
as
i
look
back
upon
my
childhood
and
particularly
upon
the
mood
in
which
i
was
on
that
for
myself
most
unlucky
day
i
can
quite
understand
the
possibility
of
such
terrible
crimes
being
committed
by
children
without
any
real
aim
in
view
without
any
real
wish
to
do
wrong
but
merely
out
of
curiosity
or
under
the
influence
of
an
unconscious
necessity
for
action
there
are
moments
when
the
human
being
sees
the
future
in
such
lurid
colours
that
he
shrinks
from
fixing
his
mental
eye
upon
it
puts
a
check
upon
all
his
intellectual
activity
and
tries
to
feel
convinced
that
the
future
will
never
be
and
that
the
past
has
never
been
at
such
moments
moments
when
thought
does
not
shrink
from
manifestations
of
will
and
the
carnal
instincts
alone
constitute
the
springs
of
life
i
can
understand
that
want
of
experience
which
is
a
particularly
predisposing
factor
in
this
connection
might
very
possibly
lead
a
child
aye
without
fear
or
hesitation
but
rather
with
a
smile
of
curiosity
on
its
face
to
set
fire
to
the
house
in
which
its
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
beings
whom
it
tenderly
loves
are
lying
asleep
it
would
be
under
the
same
influence
of
momentary
absence
of
thought
almost
absence
of
mind
that
a
peasant
boy
of
seventeen
might
catch
sight
of
the
edge
of
a
axe
reposing
near
the
bench
on
which
his
aged
father
was
lying
asleep
face
downwards
and
suddenly
raise
the
implement
in
order
to
observe
with
unconscious
curiosity
how
the
blood
would
come
spurting
out
upon
the
floor
if
he
made
a
wound
in
the
sleeper
s
neck
it
is
under
the
same
influence
the
same
absence
of
thought
the
same
instinctive
curiosity
that
a
man
finds
delight
in
standing
on
the
brink
of
an
abyss
and
thinking
to
himself
how
if
i
were
to
throw
myself
down
or
in
holding
to
his
brow
a
loaded
pistol
and
wondering
what
if
i
were
to
pull
the
trigger
or
in
feeling
when
he
catches
sight
of
some
universally
respected
personage
that
he
would
like
to
go
up
to
him
pull
his
nose
hard
and
say
how
do
you
do
old
boy
under
the
spell
then
of
this
instinctive
agitation
and
lack
of
reflection
i
was
moved
to
put
out
my
tongue
and
to
say
that
i
would
not
move
when
jerome
came
down
and
told
me
that
i
had
behaved
so
badly
that
day
as
well
as
done
my
lessons
so
ill
that
i
had
no
right
to
be
where
i
was
and
must
go
upstairs
directly
at
first
from
astonishment
and
anger
he
could
not
utter
a
word
c
est
bien
he
exclaimed
eventually
as
he
darted
towards
me
several
times
have
i
promised
to
punish
you
and
you
have
been
saved
from
it
by
your
grandmamma
but
now
i
see
that
nothing
but
the
cane
will
teach
you
obedience
and
you
shall
therefore
taste
this
was
said
loud
enough
for
every
one
to
hear
the
blood
rushed
to
my
heart
with
such
vehemence
that
i
could
feel
that
organ
beating
violently
could
feel
the
colour
rising
to
my
cheeks
and
my
lips
trembling
probably
i
looked
horrible
at
that
moment
for
avoiding
my
eye
jerome
stepped
forward
and
caught
me
by
the
hand
hardly
feeling
his
touch
i
pulled
away
my
hand
in
blind
fury
and
with
all
my
childish
might
struck
him
what
are
you
doing
said
woloda
who
had
seen
my
behaviour
and
now
approached
me
in
alarm
and
astonishment
let
me
alone
i
exclaimed
the
tears
flowing
fast
not
a
single
one
of
you
loves
me
or
understands
how
miserable
i
am
you
are
all
of
you
odious
and
disgusting
i
added
bluntly
turning
to
the
company
at
large
at
this
moment
jerome
his
face
pale
but
determined
approached
me
again
and
with
a
movement
too
quick
to
admit
of
any
defence
seized
my
hands
as
with
a
pair
of
tongs
and
dragged
me
away
my
head
swam
with
excitement
and
i
can
only
remember
that
so
long
as
i
had
strength
to
do
it
i
fought
with
head
and
legs
that
my
nose
several
times
collided
with
a
pair
of
knees
that
my
teeth
tore
some
one
s
coat
that
all
around
me
i
could
hear
the
shuffling
of
feet
and
that
i
could
smell
dust
and
the
scent
of
violets
with
which
jerome
used
to
perfume
himself
five
minutes
later
the
door
of
the
closed
behind
me
basil
said
a
triumphant
but
detestable
voice
bring
me
the
xv
dreams
could
i
at
that
moment
have
supposed
that
i
should
ever
live
to
survive
the
misfortunes
of
that
day
or
that
there
would
ever
come
a
time
when
i
should
be
able
to
look
back
upon
those
misfortunes
composedly
as
i
sat
there
thinking
over
what
i
had
done
i
could
not
imagine
what
the
matter
had
been
with
me
i
only
felt
with
despair
that
i
was
for
ever
lost
at
first
the
most
profound
stillness
reigned
around
me
at
least
so
it
appeared
to
me
as
compared
with
the
violent
internal
emotion
which
i
had
been
experiencing
but
by
and
by
i
began
to
distinguish
various
sounds
basil
brought
something
downstairs
which
he
laid
upon
a
chest
outside
it
sounded
like
a
below
me
i
could
hear
jerome
s
grumbling
voice
probably
he
was
speaking
of
me
and
then
children
s
voices
and
laughter
and
footsteps
until
in
a
few
moments
everything
seemed
to
have
regained
its
normal
course
in
the
house
as
though
nobody
knew
or
cared
to
know
that
here
was
i
sitting
alone
in
the
dark
i
did
not
cry
but
something
lay
heavy
like
a
stone
upon
my
heart
ideas
and
pictures
passed
with
extraordinary
rapidity
before
my
troubled
imagination
yet
through
their
fantastic
sequence
broke
continually
the
remembrance
of
the
misfortune
which
had
befallen
me
as
i
once
again
plunged
into
an
interminable
labyrinth
of
conjectures
as
to
the
punishment
the
fate
and
the
despair
that
were
awaiting
me
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
there
must
be
some
reason
for
the
general
dislike
even
contempt
which
i
fancied
to
be
felt
for
me
by
others
i
was
firmly
convinced
that
every
one
from
grandmamma
down
to
the
coachman
philip
despised
me
and
found
pleasure
in
my
sufferings
next
an
idea
struck
me
that
perhaps
i
was
not
the
son
of
my
father
and
mother
at
all
nor
woloda
s
brother
but
only
some
unfortunate
orphan
who
had
been
adopted
by
them
out
of
compassion
and
this
absurd
notion
not
only
afforded
me
a
certain
melancholy
consolation
but
seemed
to
me
quite
probable
i
found
it
comforting
to
think
that
i
was
unhappy
not
through
my
own
fault
but
because
i
was
fated
to
be
so
from
my
birth
and
conceived
that
my
destiny
was
very
much
like
poor
karl
ivanitch
s
why
conceal
the
secret
any
longer
now
that
i
have
discovered
it
i
reflected
i
will
go
to
papa
and
say
to
him
it
is
in
vain
for
you
to
try
and
conceal
from
me
the
mystery
of
my
birth
i
know
it
and
he
will
answer
me
what
else
could
i
do
my
good
fellow
sooner
or
later
you
would
have
had
to
know
that
you
are
not
my
son
but
were
adopted
as
such
nevertheless
so
long
as
you
remain
worthy
of
my
love
i
will
never
cast
you
then
i
shall
say
papa
though
i
have
no
right
to
call
you
by
that
name
and
am
now
doing
so
for
the
last
time
i
have
always
loved
you
and
shall
always
retain
that
love
at
the
same
time
while
i
can
never
forget
that
you
have
been
my
benefactor
i
can
not
remain
longer
in
your
house
nobody
here
loves
me
and
jerome
has
wrought
my
ruin
either
he
or
i
must
go
forth
since
i
can
not
answer
for
myself
i
hate
the
man
so
that
i
could
do
anything
i
could
even
kill
papa
will
begin
to
entreat
me
but
i
shall
make
a
gesture
and
say
no
no
my
friend
and
benefactor
we
can
not
live
together
let
me
go
and
for
the
last
time
i
shall
embrace
him
and
say
in
french
o
mon
pere
o
mon
bienfaiteur
donne
moi
pour
la
derniere
fois
ta
benediction
et
que
la
volonte
de
dieu
soit
faite
i
sobbed
bitterly
at
these
thoughts
as
i
sat
on
a
trunk
in
that
dark
storeroom
then
suddenly
recollecting
the
shameful
punishment
which
was
awaiting
me
i
would
find
myself
back
again
in
actuality
and
the
dreams
had
fled
soon
again
i
began
to
fancy
myself
far
away
from
the
house
and
alone
in
the
world
i
enter
a
hussar
regiment
and
go
to
war
surrounded
by
the
foe
on
every
side
i
wave
my
sword
and
kill
one
of
them
and
wound
another
then
a
third
then
a
fourth
at
last
exhausted
with
loss
of
blood
and
fatigue
i
fall
to
the
ground
and
cry
victory
the
general
comes
to
look
for
me
asking
where
is
our
saviour
whereupon
i
am
pointed
out
to
him
he
embraces
me
and
in
his
turn
exclaims
with
tears
of
joy
victory
i
recover
and
with
my
arm
in
a
black
sling
go
to
walk
on
the
boulevards
i
am
a
general
now
i
meet
the
emperor
who
asks
who
is
this
young
man
who
has
been
wounded
he
is
told
that
it
is
the
famous
hero
nicolas
whereupon
he
approaches
me
and
says
my
thanks
to
you
whatsoever
you
may
ask
for
i
will
grant
to
this
i
bow
respectfully
and
leaning
on
my
sword
reply
i
am
happy
most
august
emperor
that
i
have
been
able
to
shed
my
blood
for
my
country
i
would
gladly
have
died
for
it
yet
since
you
are
so
generous
as
to
grant
any
wish
of
mine
i
venture
to
ask
of
you
permission
to
annihilate
my
enemy
the
foreigner
jerome
and
then
i
step
fiercely
before
jerome
and
say
you
were
the
cause
of
all
my
fortunes
down
now
on
your
knees
unfortunately
this
recalled
to
my
mind
the
fact
that
at
any
moment
the
real
jerome
might
be
entering
with
the
cane
so
that
once
more
i
saw
myself
not
a
general
and
the
saviour
of
my
country
but
an
unhappy
pitiful
creature
then
the
idea
of
god
occurred
to
me
and
i
asked
him
boldly
why
he
had
punished
me
thus
seeing
that
i
had
never
forgotten
to
say
my
prayers
either
morning
or
evening
indeed
i
can
positively
declare
that
it
was
during
that
hour
in
the
that
i
took
the
first
step
towards
the
religious
doubt
which
afterwards
assailed
me
during
my
youth
not
that
mere
misfortune
could
arouse
me
to
infidelity
and
murmuring
but
that
at
moments
of
utter
contrition
and
solitude
the
idea
of
the
injustice
of
providence
took
root
in
me
as
readily
as
bad
seed
takes
root
in
land
well
soaked
with
rain
also
i
imagined
that
i
was
going
to
die
there
and
then
and
drew
vivid
pictures
of
jerome
s
astonishment
when
he
entered
the
and
found
a
corpse
there
instead
of
myself
likewise
recollecting
what
natalia
savishna
had
told
me
of
the
forty
days
during
which
the
souls
of
the
departed
must
hover
around
their
earthly
home
i
imagined
myself
flying
through
the
rooms
of
grandmamma
s
house
and
seeing
lubotshka
s
bitter
tears
and
hearing
grandmamma
s
lamentations
and
listening
to
papa
and
jerome
talking
together
he
was
a
fine
boy
papa
would
say
with
tears
in
his
eyes
yes
jerome
would
reply
but
a
sad
scapegrace
and
but
you
should
respect
the
dead
would
expostulate
papa
you
were
the
cause
of
his
death
you
frightened
him
until
he
could
no
longer
bear
the
thought
of
the
humiliation
which
you
were
about
to
inflict
upon
him
away
from
me
criminal
upon
that
jerome
would
fall
upon
his
knees
and
implore
forgiveness
and
when
the
forty
days
were
ended
my
soul
would
fly
to
heaven
and
see
there
something
wonderfully
beautiful
white
and
transparent
and
know
that
it
was
mamma
and
that
something
would
embrace
and
caress
me
yet
all
at
once
i
should
feel
troubled
and
not
know
her
if
it
be
you
i
should
say
to
her
show
yourself
more
distinctly
so
that
i
may
embrace
you
in
and
her
voice
would
answer
me
do
you
not
feel
happy
thus
and
i
should
reply
yes
i
do
but
you
can
not
really
caress
me
and
i
can
not
really
kiss
your
hand
like
but
it
is
not
necessary
she
would
say
there
can
be
happiness
here
without
that
and
i
should
feel
that
it
was
so
and
we
should
ascend
together
ever
higher
and
higher
until
suddenly
i
feel
as
though
i
am
being
thrown
down
again
and
find
myself
sitting
on
the
trunk
in
the
dark
my
cheeks
wet
with
tears
and
my
thoughts
in
a
mist
yet
still
repeating
the
words
let
us
ascend
together
higher
and
indeed
it
was
a
long
long
while
before
i
could
remember
where
i
was
for
at
that
moment
my
mind
s
eye
saw
only
a
dark
dreadful
illimitable
void
i
tried
to
renew
the
happy
consoling
dream
which
had
been
thus
interrupted
by
the
return
to
reality
but
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
as
soon
as
ever
i
attempted
to
former
dreams
their
continuation
became
impossible
while
which
astonished
me
even
more
they
no
longer
gave
me
pleasure
xvi
keep
on
grinding
and
you
ll
have
flour
i
passed
the
night
in
the
and
nothing
further
happened
except
that
on
the
following
morning
a
sunday
i
was
removed
to
a
small
chamber
adjoining
the
schoolroom
and
once
more
shut
up
i
began
to
hope
that
my
punishment
was
going
to
be
limited
to
confinement
and
found
my
thoughts
growing
calmer
under
the
influence
of
a
sound
soft
sleep
the
clear
sunlight
playing
upon
the
frost
crystals
of
the
windowpanes
and
the
familiar
noises
in
the
street
nevertheless
solitude
gradually
became
intolerable
i
wanted
to
move
about
and
to
communicate
to
some
one
all
that
was
lying
upon
my
heart
but
not
a
living
creature
was
near
me
the
position
was
the
more
unpleasant
because
i
could
hear
jerome
walking
about
in
his
room
and
softly
whistling
some
hackneyed
tune
somehow
i
felt
convinced
that
he
was
whistling
not
because
he
wanted
to
but
because
he
knew
it
annoyed
me
at
two
o
clock
he
and
woloda
departed
downstairs
and
nicola
brought
me
up
some
luncheon
when
i
told
him
what
i
had
done
and
what
was
awaiting
me
he
said
pshaw
sir
don
t
be
alarmed
keep
on
grinding
and
you
ll
have
although
this
expression
which
also
in
later
days
has
more
than
once
helped
me
to
preserve
my
firmness
of
mind
brought
me
a
little
comfort
the
fact
that
i
received
not
bread
and
water
only
but
a
whole
luncheon
and
even
dessert
gave
me
much
to
think
about
if
they
had
sent
me
no
dessert
it
would
have
meant
that
my
punishment
was
to
be
limited
to
confinement
whereas
it
was
now
evident
that
i
was
looked
upon
as
not
yet
punished
that
i
was
only
being
kept
away
from
the
others
as
an
until
the
due
time
of
punishment
while
i
was
still
debating
the
question
the
key
of
my
prison
turned
and
jerome
entered
with
a
severe
official
air
come
down
and
see
your
grandmamma
he
said
without
looking
at
me
i
should
have
liked
first
to
have
brushed
my
jacket
since
it
was
covered
with
dust
but
jerome
said
that
that
was
quite
unnecessary
since
i
was
in
such
a
deplorable
moral
condition
that
my
exterior
was
not
worth
considering
as
he
led
me
through
the
salon
katenka
lubotshka
and
woloda
looked
at
me
with
much
the
same
expression
as
we
were
wont
to
look
at
the
convicts
who
on
certain
days
filed
past
my
grandmother
s
house
likewise
when
i
approached
grandmamma
s
to
kiss
her
hand
she
withdrew
it
and
thrust
it
under
her
mantilla
well
my
dear
she
began
after
a
long
pause
during
which
she
regarded
me
from
head
to
foot
with
the
kind
of
expression
which
makes
one
uncertain
where
to
look
or
what
to
do
i
must
say
that
you
seem
to
value
my
love
very
highly
and
afford
me
great
then
she
went
on
with
an
emphasis
on
each
word
monsieur
jerome
who
at
my
request
undertook
your
education
says
that
he
can
no
longer
remain
in
the
house
and
why
simply
because
of
another
pause
ensued
presently
she
continued
in
a
tone
which
clearly
showed
that
her
speech
had
been
prepared
beforehand
i
had
hoped
that
you
would
be
grateful
for
all
his
care
and
for
all
the
trouble
that
he
has
taken
with
you
that
you
would
have
appreciated
his
services
but
you
you
baby
you
silly
boy
you
actually
dare
to
raise
your
hand
against
him
very
well
very
good
i
am
beginning
to
think
that
you
can
not
understand
kind
treatment
but
require
to
be
treated
in
a
very
different
and
humiliating
fashion
go
now
directly
and
beg
his
pardon
she
added
in
a
stern
and
peremptory
tone
as
she
pointed
to
jerome
do
you
hear
me
i
followed
the
direction
of
her
finger
with
my
eye
but
on
that
member
alighting
upon
jerome
s
coat
i
turned
my
head
away
and
once
more
felt
my
heart
beating
violently
as
i
remained
where
i
was
what
did
you
not
hear
me
when
i
told
you
what
to
do
i
was
trembling
all
over
but
i
would
not
stir
koko
went
on
my
grandmother
probably
divining
my
inward
sufferings
koko
she
repeated
in
a
voice
tender
rather
than
harsh
is
this
you
grandmamma
i
can
not
beg
his
pardon
for
and
i
stopped
suddenly
for
i
felt
the
next
word
refuse
to
come
for
the
tears
that
were
choking
me
but
i
ordered
you
i
begged
of
you
to
do
so
what
is
the
matter
with
you
will
not
i
can
not
i
gasped
and
the
tears
long
pent
up
and
accumulated
in
my
breast
burst
forth
like
a
stream
which
breaks
its
dikes
and
goes
flowing
madly
over
the
country
c
est
ainsi
que
vous
obeissez
a
votre
seconde
mere
c
est
ainsi
que
vous
reconnaissez
ses
bontes
remarked
jerome
quietly
a
genoux
good
god
if
she
had
seen
this
exclaimed
grandmamma
turning
from
me
and
wiping
away
her
tears
if
she
had
seen
this
it
may
be
all
for
the
best
yet
she
could
never
have
survived
such
grief
never
and
grandmamma
wept
more
and
more
i
too
wept
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
ask
for
pardon
au
nom
du
ciel
madame
la
comtesse
said
jerome
but
grandmamma
heard
him
not
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
her
sobs
soon
passed
to
hiccups
and
hysteria
mimi
and
gasha
came
running
in
with
frightened
faces
salts
and
spirits
were
applied
and
the
whole
house
was
soon
in
a
ferment
you
may
feel
pleased
at
your
work
said
jerome
to
me
as
he
led
me
from
the
room
good
god
what
have
i
done
i
thought
to
myself
what
a
terribly
bad
boy
i
am
as
soon
as
jerome
bidding
me
go
into
his
room
had
returned
to
grandmamma
i
all
unconscious
of
what
i
was
doing
ran
down
the
grand
staircase
leading
to
the
front
door
whether
i
intended
to
drown
myself
or
whether
merely
to
run
away
from
home
i
do
not
remember
i
only
know
that
i
went
blindly
on
my
face
covered
with
my
hands
that
i
might
see
nothing
where
are
you
going
to
asked
a
voice
i
want
you
my
i
would
have
passed
on
but
papa
caught
hold
of
me
and
said
sternly
come
here
you
impudent
rascal
how
could
you
dare
to
do
such
a
thing
as
to
touch
the
portfolio
in
my
study
he
went
on
as
he
dragged
me
into
his
room
oh
you
are
silent
eh
and
he
pulled
my
ear
yes
i
was
naughty
i
said
i
don
t
know
myself
what
came
over
me
so
you
don
t
know
what
came
over
you
you
don
t
know
you
don
t
know
he
repeated
as
he
pulled
my
ear
harder
and
harder
will
you
go
and
put
your
nose
where
you
ought
not
to
again
will
you
will
you
although
my
ear
was
in
great
pain
i
did
not
cry
but
on
the
contrary
felt
a
sort
of
morally
pleasing
sensation
no
sooner
did
he
let
go
of
my
ear
than
i
seized
his
hand
and
covered
it
with
tears
and
kisses
please
whip
me
i
cried
sobbing
please
hurt
me
the
more
and
more
for
i
am
a
wretched
bad
miserable
boy
why
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you
he
said
giving
me
a
slight
push
from
him
no
i
will
not
go
away
i
continued
seizing
his
coat
every
one
else
hates
me
i
know
that
but
do
you
listen
to
me
and
protect
me
or
else
send
me
away
altogether
i
can
not
live
with
him
he
tries
to
humiliate
me
he
tells
me
to
kneel
before
him
and
wants
to
strike
me
i
can
t
stand
it
i
m
not
a
baby
i
can
t
stand
it
i
shall
die
i
shall
kill
myself
he
told
grandmamma
that
i
was
naughty
and
now
she
is
ill
she
will
die
through
me
it
is
all
his
fault
please
let
me
me
the
tears
choked
my
further
speech
i
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
with
my
head
buried
on
papa
s
knees
sobbed
until
i
thought
i
should
die
of
grief
come
come
why
are
you
such
a
said
papa
compassionately
as
he
stooped
over
me
he
is
such
a
bully
he
is
murdering
me
i
shall
die
nobody
loves
me
at
all
i
gasped
almost
inaudibly
and
went
into
convulsions
papa
lifted
me
up
and
carried
me
to
my
bedroom
where
i
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
it
was
late
only
a
solitary
candle
burned
in
the
room
while
beside
the
bed
there
were
seated
mimi
lubotshka
and
our
doctor
in
their
faces
i
could
discern
anxiety
for
my
health
so
although
i
felt
so
well
after
my
sleep
that
i
could
have
got
up
directly
i
thought
it
best
to
let
them
continue
thinking
that
i
was
unwell
xvii
hatred
yes
it
was
the
real
feeling
of
hatred
that
was
mine
now
not
the
hatred
of
which
one
reads
in
novels
and
in
the
existence
of
which
i
do
not
believe
the
hatred
which
finds
satisfaction
in
doing
harm
to
a
but
the
hatred
which
consists
of
an
unconquerable
aversion
to
a
person
who
may
be
wholly
deserving
of
your
esteem
yet
whose
very
hair
neck
walk
voice
limbs
movements
and
everything
else
are
disgusting
to
you
while
all
the
while
an
incomprehensible
force
attracts
you
towards
him
and
compels
you
to
follow
his
slightest
acts
with
anxious
attention
this
was
the
feeling
which
i
cherished
for
jerome
who
had
lived
with
us
now
for
a
year
and
a
half
judging
coolly
of
the
man
at
this
time
of
day
i
find
that
he
was
a
true
frenchman
but
a
frenchman
in
the
better
acceptation
of
the
term
he
was
fairly
well
educated
and
fulfilled
his
duties
to
us
conscientiously
but
he
had
the
peculiar
features
of
fickle
egotism
boastfulness
impertinence
and
ignorant
which
are
common
to
all
his
countrymen
as
well
as
entirely
opposed
to
the
russian
character
all
this
set
me
against
him
grandmamma
had
signified
to
him
her
dislike
for
corporal
punishment
and
therefore
he
dared
not
beat
us
but
he
frequently
threatened
us
particularly
myself
with
the
cane
and
would
utter
the
word
fouetter
as
though
it
were
fouatter
in
an
expressive
and
detestable
way
which
always
gave
me
the
idea
that
to
whip
me
would
afford
him
the
greatest
possible
satisfaction
i
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
the
bodily
pain
for
i
had
never
experienced
it
it
was
the
mere
idea
that
he
could
beat
me
that
threw
me
into
such
paroxysms
of
wrath
and
despair
true
karl
ivanitch
sometimes
in
moments
of
exasperation
had
recourse
to
a
ruler
or
to
his
braces
but
that
i
can
look
back
upon
without
anger
even
if
he
had
struck
me
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
namely
when
i
was
fourteen
years
old
i
should
have
submitted
quietly
to
the
correction
for
i
loved
him
and
had
known
him
all
my
life
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
member
of
our
family
but
jerome
was
a
conceited
opinionated
fellow
for
whom
i
felt
merely
the
unwilling
respect
which
i
entertained
for
all
persons
older
than
myself
karl
ivanitch
was
a
comical
old
uncle
whom
i
loved
with
my
whole
heart
but
who
according
to
my
childish
conception
of
social
distinctions
ranked
below
us
whereas
jerome
was
a
handsome
young
dandy
who
was
for
showing
himself
the
equal
of
any
one
karl
ivanitch
had
always
scolded
and
punished
us
coolly
as
though
he
thought
it
a
necessary
but
extremely
disagreeable
duty
jerome
on
the
contrary
always
liked
to
emphasise
his
part
as
judge
when
correcting
us
and
clearly
did
it
as
much
for
his
own
satisfaction
as
for
our
good
he
loved
authority
nevertheless
i
always
found
his
grandiloquent
french
phrases
which
he
pronounced
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
all
the
final
syllables
inexpressibly
disgusting
whereas
karl
when
angry
had
never
said
anything
beyond
what
a
foolish
it
is
or
you
boys
are
as
irritating
as
spanish
fly
which
he
always
called
spaniard
fly
jerome
however
had
names
for
us
like
mauvais
sujet
villain
garnement
and
so
forth
epithets
which
greatly
offended
my
when
karl
ivanitch
ordered
us
to
kneel
in
the
corner
with
our
faces
to
the
wall
the
punishment
consisted
merely
in
the
bodily
discomfort
of
the
position
whereas
jerome
in
such
cases
always
assumed
a
haughty
air
made
a
grandiose
gesture
with
his
hand
and
exclaiming
in
a
tone
a
genoux
mauvais
sujet
ordered
us
to
kneel
with
our
faces
towards
him
and
to
crave
his
pardon
his
punishment
consisted
in
humiliation
however
on
the
present
occasion
the
punishment
never
came
nor
was
the
matter
ever
referred
to
again
yet
i
could
not
forget
all
that
i
had
gone
through
the
shame
the
fear
and
the
hatred
of
those
two
days
from
that
time
forth
jerome
appeared
to
give
me
up
in
despair
and
took
no
further
trouble
with
me
yet
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
treat
him
with
indifference
every
time
that
our
eyes
met
i
felt
that
my
look
expressed
only
too
plainly
my
dislike
and
though
i
tried
hard
to
assume
a
careless
air
he
seemed
to
divine
my
hypocrisy
until
i
was
forced
to
blush
and
turn
away
in
short
it
was
a
terrible
trial
to
me
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
xviii
the
maidservants
room
i
began
to
feel
more
and
more
lonely
until
my
chief
solace
lay
in
solitary
reflection
and
observation
of
the
favourite
subject
of
my
reflections
i
shall
speak
in
the
next
chapter
the
scene
where
i
indulged
in
them
was
for
preference
the
maidservants
room
where
a
plot
suitable
for
a
novel
was
in
progress
a
plot
which
touched
and
engrossed
me
to
the
highest
degree
the
heroine
of
the
romance
was
of
course
masha
she
was
in
love
with
basil
who
had
known
her
before
she
had
become
a
servant
in
our
house
and
who
had
promised
to
marry
her
some
day
unfortunately
fate
which
had
separated
them
five
years
ago
and
afterwards
reunited
them
in
grandmamma
s
abode
next
proceeded
to
interpose
an
obstacle
between
them
in
the
shape
of
masha
s
uncle
our
man
nicola
who
would
not
hear
of
his
niece
marrying
that
uneducated
and
unbearable
fellow
as
he
called
basil
one
effect
of
the
obstacle
had
been
to
make
the
otherwise
slightly
cool
and
indifferent
basil
fall
as
passionately
in
love
with
masha
as
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
be
who
is
only
a
servant
and
a
tailor
wears
a
red
shirt
and
has
his
hair
pomaded
although
his
methods
of
expressing
his
affection
were
odd
for
instance
whenever
he
met
masha
he
always
endeavoured
to
inflict
upon
her
some
bodily
pain
either
by
pinching
her
giving
her
a
slap
with
his
open
hand
or
squeezing
her
so
hard
that
she
could
scarcely
breathe
that
affection
was
sincere
enough
and
he
proved
it
by
the
fact
that
from
the
moment
when
nicola
refused
him
his
niece
s
hand
his
grief
led
him
to
drinking
and
to
frequenting
taverns
until
he
proved
so
unruly
that
more
than
once
he
had
to
be
sent
to
undergo
a
humiliating
chastisement
at
the
nevertheless
these
faults
of
his
and
their
consequences
only
served
to
elevate
him
in
masha
s
eyes
and
to
increase
her
love
for
him
whenever
he
was
in
the
hands
of
the
police
she
would
sit
crying
the
whole
day
and
complain
to
gasha
of
her
hard
fate
gasha
played
an
active
part
in
the
affairs
of
these
unfortunate
lovers
then
regardless
of
her
uncle
s
anger
and
blows
she
would
stealthily
make
her
way
to
the
there
to
visit
and
console
her
swain
excuse
me
reader
for
introducing
you
to
such
company
nevertheless
if
the
cords
of
love
and
compassion
have
not
wholly
snapped
in
your
soul
you
will
find
even
in
that
maidservants
room
something
which
may
cause
them
to
vibrate
again
so
whether
you
please
to
follow
me
or
not
i
will
return
to
the
alcove
on
the
staircase
whence
i
was
able
to
observe
all
that
passed
in
that
room
from
my
post
i
could
see
the
with
upon
it
an
iron
an
old
with
its
peg
bent
crooked
a
and
a
basin
there
too
was
the
window
with
in
fine
disorder
before
it
a
piece
of
black
wax
some
fragments
of
silk
a
cucumber
a
box
of
sweets
and
so
on
there
too
was
the
large
table
at
which
she
used
to
sit
in
the
pink
cotton
dress
which
i
admired
so
much
and
the
blue
handkerchief
which
always
caught
my
attention
so
she
would
be
interrupting
her
work
at
intervals
to
scratch
her
head
a
little
to
bite
the
end
of
her
thread
or
to
snuff
the
candle
and
i
would
think
to
myself
why
was
she
not
born
a
lady
she
with
her
blue
eyes
beautiful
fair
hair
and
magnificent
bust
how
splendid
she
would
look
if
she
were
sitting
in
a
and
dressed
in
a
cap
with
pink
ribbons
and
a
silk
gown
not
one
like
mimi
s
but
one
like
the
gown
which
i
saw
the
other
day
on
the
tverski
boulevard
yes
she
would
work
at
the
and
i
would
sit
and
look
at
her
in
the
mirror
and
be
ready
to
do
whatsoever
she
wanted
to
help
her
on
with
her
mantle
or
to
hand
her
food
as
for
basil
s
drunken
face
and
horrid
figure
in
the
scanty
coat
with
the
red
shirt
showing
beneath
it
well
in
his
every
gesture
in
his
every
movement
of
his
back
i
seemed
always
to
see
signs
of
the
humiliating
chastisements
which
he
had
undergone
ah
basil
again
cried
masha
on
one
occasion
as
she
stuck
her
needle
into
the
pincushion
but
without
looking
up
at
the
person
who
was
entering
what
is
the
good
of
a
man
like
him
was
basil
s
first
remark
yes
if
only
he
would
say
something
decisive
but
i
am
powerless
in
the
matter
i
am
all
at
odds
and
ends
and
through
his
fault
will
you
have
some
tea
put
in
madesha
another
servant
no
thank
but
why
does
he
hate
me
so
that
old
thief
of
an
uncle
of
yours
why
is
it
because
of
the
clothes
i
wear
or
of
my
height
or
of
my
walk
or
what
well
damn
and
confound
him
finished
basil
snapping
his
fingers
we
must
be
patient
said
masha
threading
her
needle
you
are
so
it
is
my
nerves
that
won
t
stand
it
that
s
at
this
moment
the
door
of
grandmamma
s
room
banged
and
gasha
s
angry
voice
could
be
heard
as
she
came
up
the
stairs
there
she
muttered
with
a
gesture
of
her
hands
try
to
please
people
when
even
they
themselves
do
not
know
what
they
want
and
it
is
a
cursed
life
sheer
hard
labour
and
nothing
else
if
only
a
certain
thing
would
happen
though
god
forgive
me
for
thinking
it
good
evening
agatha
michaelovna
said
basil
rising
to
greet
her
you
here
she
answered
brusquely
as
she
stared
at
him
that
is
not
very
much
to
your
credit
what
do
you
come
here
for
is
the
maids
room
a
proper
place
for
men
i
wanted
to
see
how
you
were
said
basil
soothingly
i
shall
soon
be
breathing
my
last
that
s
how
i
am
cried
gasha
still
greatly
incensed
basil
laughed
oh
there
s
nothing
to
laugh
at
when
i
say
that
i
shall
soon
be
dead
but
that
s
how
it
will
be
all
the
same
just
look
at
the
drunkard
marry
her
would
he
the
fool
come
get
out
of
here
and
with
a
stamp
of
her
foot
on
the
floor
gasha
retreated
to
her
own
room
and
banged
the
door
behind
her
until
the
window
rattled
again
for
a
while
she
could
be
heard
scolding
at
everything
flinging
dresses
and
other
things
about
and
pulling
the
ears
of
her
favourite
cat
then
the
door
opened
again
and
puss
mewing
pitifully
was
flung
forth
by
the
tail
i
had
better
come
another
time
for
tea
said
basil
in
a
whisper
at
some
better
time
for
our
no
no
put
in
madesha
i
ll
go
and
fetch
the
urn
at
i
mean
to
put
an
end
to
things
soon
went
on
basil
seating
himself
beside
masha
as
soon
as
ever
madesha
had
left
the
room
i
had
much
better
go
straight
to
the
countess
and
say
or
i
will
throw
up
my
situation
and
go
off
into
the
world
oh
dear
oh
dear
and
am
i
to
remain
here
ah
there
s
the
difficulty
that
s
what
i
feel
so
badly
about
you
have
been
my
sweetheart
so
long
you
see
ah
dear
me
why
don
t
you
bring
me
your
shirts
to
wash
basil
asked
masha
after
a
pause
during
which
she
had
been
inspecting
his
at
this
moment
grandmamma
s
bell
rang
and
gasha
issued
from
her
room
again
what
do
you
want
with
her
you
impudent
fellow
she
cried
as
she
pushed
basil
who
had
risen
at
her
entrance
before
her
towards
the
door
first
you
lead
a
girl
on
and
then
you
want
to
lead
her
further
still
i
suppose
it
amuses
you
to
see
her
tears
there
s
the
door
now
off
you
go
we
want
your
room
not
your
company
and
what
good
can
you
see
in
him
she
went
on
turning
to
masha
has
not
your
uncle
been
walking
into
you
already
no
she
must
stick
to
her
promise
forsooth
i
will
have
no
one
but
basil
fool
that
you
are
yes
i
will
have
no
one
but
him
i
ll
never
love
any
one
else
i
could
kill
myself
for
him
poor
masha
burst
out
the
tears
suddenly
gushing
forth
for
a
while
i
stood
watching
her
as
she
wiped
away
those
tears
then
i
fell
to
contemplating
basil
attentively
in
the
hope
of
finding
out
what
there
was
in
him
that
she
found
so
attractive
yet
though
i
sympathised
with
her
sincerely
in
her
grief
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
understand
how
such
a
charming
creature
as
i
considered
her
to
be
could
love
a
man
like
him
when
i
become
a
man
i
thought
to
myself
as
i
returned
to
my
room
petrovskoe
shall
be
mine
and
basil
and
masha
my
servants
some
day
when
i
am
sitting
in
my
study
and
smoking
a
pipe
masha
will
chance
to
pass
the
door
on
her
way
to
the
kitchen
with
an
iron
and
i
shall
say
masha
come
here
and
she
will
enter
and
there
will
be
no
one
else
in
the
room
then
suddenly
basil
too
will
enter
and
on
seeing
her
will
cry
my
sweetheart
is
lost
to
me
and
masha
will
begin
to
weep
then
i
shall
say
basil
i
know
that
you
love
her
and
that
she
loves
you
here
are
a
thousand
roubles
for
you
marry
her
and
may
god
grant
you
both
happiness
then
i
shall
leave
them
among
the
countless
thoughts
and
fancies
which
pass
without
logic
or
sequence
through
the
mind
and
the
imagination
there
are
always
some
which
leave
behind
them
a
mark
so
profound
that
without
remembering
their
exact
subject
we
can
at
least
recall
that
something
good
has
passed
through
our
brain
and
try
to
retain
and
reproduce
its
effect
such
was
the
mark
left
upon
my
consciousness
by
the
idea
of
sacrificing
my
feelings
to
masha
s
happiness
seeing
that
she
believed
that
she
could
attain
it
only
through
a
union
with
basil
xix
boyhood
perhaps
people
will
scarcely
believe
me
when
i
tell
them
what
were
the
dearest
most
constant
objects
of
my
reflections
during
my
boyhood
so
little
did
those
objects
consort
with
my
age
and
position
yet
in
my
opinion
contrast
between
a
man
s
actual
position
and
his
moral
activity
constitutes
the
most
reliable
sign
of
his
genuineness
during
the
period
when
i
was
leading
a
solitary
and
moral
life
i
was
much
taken
up
with
abstract
thoughts
on
man
s
destiny
on
a
future
life
and
on
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
with
all
the
ardour
of
inexperience
strove
to
make
my
youthful
intellect
solve
those
questions
the
questions
which
constitute
the
highest
level
of
thought
to
which
the
human
intellect
can
tend
but
a
final
decision
of
which
the
human
intellect
can
never
succeed
in
attaining
i
believe
the
intellect
to
take
the
same
course
of
development
in
the
individual
as
in
the
mass
as
also
that
the
thoughts
which
serve
as
a
basis
for
philosophical
theories
are
an
inseparable
part
of
that
intellect
and
that
every
man
must
be
more
or
less
conscious
of
those
thoughts
before
he
can
know
anything
of
the
existence
of
philosophical
theories
to
my
own
mind
those
thoughts
presented
themselves
with
such
clarity
and
force
that
i
tried
to
apply
them
to
life
in
the
fond
belief
that
i
was
the
first
to
have
discovered
such
splendid
and
invaluable
truths
sometimes
i
would
suppose
that
happiness
depends
not
upon
external
causes
themselves
but
only
upon
our
relation
to
them
and
that
provided
a
man
can
accustom
himself
to
bearing
suffering
he
need
never
be
unhappy
to
prove
the
latter
hypothesis
i
would
despite
the
horrible
pain
hold
out
a
tatistchev
s
dictionary
at
arm
s
length
for
five
minutes
at
a
time
or
else
go
into
the
and
scourge
my
back
with
cords
until
the
tears
involuntarily
came
to
my
eyes
another
time
suddenly
bethinking
me
that
death
might
find
me
at
any
hour
or
any
minute
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
man
could
only
be
happy
by
using
the
present
to
the
full
and
taking
no
thought
for
the
future
indeed
i
wondered
how
people
had
never
found
that
out
before
acting
under
the
influence
of
the
new
idea
i
laid
my
aside
for
two
or
three
days
and
reposing
on
my
bed
gave
myself
up
to
and
the
eating
of
which
i
had
bought
with
my
last
remaining
coins
again
standing
one
day
before
the
blackboard
and
smearing
figures
on
it
with
honey
i
was
struck
with
the
thought
why
is
symmetry
so
agreeable
to
the
eye
what
is
symmetry
of
course
it
is
an
innate
sense
i
continued
yet
what
is
its
basis
perhaps
everything
in
life
is
symmetry
but
no
on
the
contrary
this
is
life
and
i
drew
an
oblong
figure
on
the
board
and
after
life
the
soul
passes
to
eternity
here
i
drew
a
line
from
one
end
of
the
oblong
figure
to
the
edge
of
the
board
why
should
there
not
be
a
corresponding
line
on
the
other
side
if
there
be
an
eternity
on
one
side
there
must
surely
be
a
corresponding
one
on
the
other
that
means
that
we
have
existed
in
a
previous
life
but
have
lost
the
recollection
of
this
conclusion
which
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
both
clear
and
novel
but
the
arguments
for
which
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
at
this
distance
of
time
to
piece
together
pleased
me
extremely
so
i
took
a
piece
of
paper
and
tried
to
write
it
down
but
at
the
first
attempt
such
a
rush
of
other
thoughts
came
whirling
though
my
brain
that
i
was
obliged
to
jump
up
and
pace
the
room
at
the
window
my
attention
was
arrested
by
a
driver
harnessing
a
horse
to
a
and
at
once
my
mind
concentrated
itself
upon
the
decision
of
the
question
into
what
animal
or
human
being
will
the
spirit
of
that
horse
pass
at
death
just
at
that
moment
woloda
passed
through
the
room
and
smiled
to
see
me
absorbed
in
speculative
thoughts
his
smile
at
once
made
me
feel
that
all
that
i
had
been
thinking
about
was
utter
nonsense
i
have
related
all
this
as
i
recollect
it
in
order
to
show
the
reader
the
nature
of
my
cogitations
no
philosophical
theory
attracted
me
so
much
as
scepticism
which
at
one
period
brought
me
to
a
state
of
mind
verging
upon
insanity
i
took
the
fancy
into
my
head
that
no
one
nor
anything
really
existed
in
the
world
except
myself
that
objects
were
not
objects
at
all
but
that
images
of
them
became
manifest
only
so
soon
as
i
turned
my
attention
upon
them
and
vanished
again
directly
that
i
ceased
to
think
about
them
in
short
this
idea
of
mine
that
real
objects
do
not
exist
but
only
one
s
conception
of
them
brought
me
to
schelling
s
theory
there
were
moments
when
the
influence
of
this
idea
led
me
to
such
vagaries
as
for
instance
turning
sharply
round
in
the
hope
that
by
the
suddenness
of
the
movement
i
should
come
in
contact
with
the
void
which
i
believed
to
be
existing
where
i
myself
purported
to
be
what
a
pitiful
spring
of
moral
activity
is
the
human
intellect
my
faulty
reason
could
not
define
the
impenetrable
consequently
it
shattered
one
fruitless
conviction
after
another
convictions
which
happily
for
my
after
life
i
never
lacked
the
courage
to
abandon
as
soon
as
they
proved
inadequate
from
all
this
weary
mental
struggle
i
derived
only
a
certain
pliancy
of
mind
a
weakening
of
the
will
a
habit
of
perpetual
moral
analysis
and
a
diminution
both
of
freshness
of
sentiment
and
of
clearness
of
thought
usually
abstract
thinking
develops
man
s
capacity
for
apprehending
the
bent
of
his
mind
at
certain
moments
and
laying
it
to
heart
but
my
inclination
for
abstract
thought
developed
my
consciousness
in
such
a
way
that
often
when
i
began
to
consider
even
the
simplest
matter
i
would
lose
myself
in
a
labyrinthine
analysis
of
my
own
thoughts
concerning
the
matter
in
question
that
is
to
say
i
no
longer
thought
of
the
matter
itself
but
only
of
what
i
was
thinking
about
it
if
i
had
then
asked
myself
of
what
am
i
thinking
the
true
answer
would
have
been
i
am
thinking
of
what
i
am
thinking
and
if
i
had
further
asked
myself
what
then
are
the
thoughts
of
which
i
am
thinking
i
should
have
had
to
reply
they
are
attempts
to
think
of
what
i
am
thinking
concerning
my
own
thoughts
and
so
on
reason
with
me
had
to
yield
to
excess
of
reason
every
philosophical
discovery
which
i
made
so
flattered
my
conceit
that
i
often
imagined
myself
to
be
a
great
man
discovering
new
truths
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
consequently
i
looked
down
with
proud
dignity
upon
my
yet
strange
to
state
no
sooner
did
i
come
in
contact
with
those
than
i
became
filled
with
a
stupid
shyness
of
them
and
the
higher
i
happened
to
be
standing
in
my
own
opinion
the
less
did
i
feel
capable
of
making
others
perceive
my
consciousness
of
my
own
dignity
since
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
a
sense
of
diffidence
concerning
even
the
simplest
of
my
words
and
acts
xx
woloda
the
further
i
advance
in
the
recital
of
this
period
of
my
life
the
more
difficult
and
onerous
does
the
task
become
too
rarely
do
i
find
among
the
reminiscences
of
that
time
any
moments
full
of
the
ardent
feeling
of
sincerity
which
so
often
and
so
cheeringly
illumined
my
childhood
gladly
would
i
pass
in
haste
over
my
lonely
boyhood
the
sooner
to
arrive
at
the
happy
time
when
once
again
a
tender
sincere
and
noble
friendship
marked
with
a
gleam
of
light
at
once
the
termination
of
that
period
and
the
beginning
of
a
phase
of
my
youth
which
was
full
of
the
charm
of
poetry
therefore
i
will
not
pursue
my
recollections
from
hour
to
hour
but
only
throw
a
cursory
glance
at
the
most
prominent
of
them
from
the
time
to
which
i
have
now
carried
my
tale
to
the
moment
of
my
first
contact
with
the
exceptional
personality
that
was
fated
to
exercise
such
a
decisive
influence
upon
my
character
and
ideas
woloda
was
about
to
enter
the
university
tutors
came
to
give
him
lessons
independently
of
myself
and
i
listened
with
envy
and
involuntary
respect
as
he
drew
boldly
on
the
blackboard
with
white
chalk
and
talked
about
functions
sines
and
so
forth
all
of
which
seemed
to
me
terms
pertaining
to
unattainable
wisdom
at
length
one
sunday
before
luncheon
all
the
tutors
and
among
them
two
professors
assembled
in
grandmamma
s
room
and
in
the
presence
of
papa
and
some
friends
put
woloda
through
a
rehearsal
of
his
university
examination
in
which
to
grandmamma
s
delight
he
gave
evidence
of
no
ordinary
amount
of
knowledge
questions
on
different
subjects
were
also
put
to
me
but
on
all
of
them
i
showed
complete
ignorance
while
the
fact
that
the
professors
manifestly
endeavoured
to
conceal
that
ignorance
from
grandmamma
only
confused
me
the
more
yet
after
all
i
was
only
fifteen
and
so
had
a
year
before
me
in
which
to
prepare
for
the
examinations
woloda
now
came
downstairs
for
luncheon
only
and
spent
whole
days
and
evenings
over
his
studies
in
his
own
room
to
which
he
kept
not
from
necessity
but
because
he
preferred
its
seclusion
he
was
very
ambitious
and
meant
to
pass
the
examinations
not
by
halves
but
with
flying
colours
the
first
day
arrived
woloda
was
wearing
a
new
blue
frockcoat
with
brass
buttons
a
gold
watch
and
shiny
boots
at
the
door
stood
papa
s
phaeton
which
nicola
duly
opened
and
presently
when
woloda
and
jerome
set
out
for
the
university
the
girls
particularly
katenka
could
be
seen
gazing
with
beaming
faces
from
the
window
at
woloda
s
pleasing
figure
as
it
sat
in
the
carriage
papa
said
several
times
god
go
with
him
and
grandmamma
who
also
had
dragged
herself
to
the
window
continued
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
as
long
as
the
phaeton
was
visible
as
well
as
to
murmur
something
to
herself
when
woloda
returned
every
one
eagerly
crowded
round
him
how
many
marks
were
they
good
ones
but
his
happy
face
was
an
answer
in
itself
he
had
received
five
maximum
the
next
day
he
sped
on
his
way
with
the
same
good
wishes
and
the
same
anxiety
for
his
success
and
was
welcomed
home
with
the
same
eagerness
and
joy
this
lasted
for
nine
days
on
the
tenth
day
there
was
to
be
the
last
and
most
difficult
examination
of
all
the
one
in
divinity
we
all
stood
at
the
window
and
watched
for
him
with
greater
impatience
than
ever
two
o
clock
and
yet
no
woloda
here
they
come
papa
here
they
come
suddenly
screamed
lubotshka
as
she
peered
through
the
window
sure
enough
the
phaeton
was
driving
up
with
jerome
and
woloda
the
latter
no
longer
in
his
grey
cap
and
blue
frockcoat
but
in
the
uniform
of
a
student
of
the
university
with
its
embroidered
blue
collar
hat
and
gilded
sword
ah
if
only
she
had
been
alive
now
exclaimed
grandmamma
on
seeing
woloda
in
this
dress
and
swooned
away
woloda
enters
the
anteroom
with
a
beaming
face
and
embraces
myself
lubotshka
mimi
and
katenka
the
latter
blushing
to
her
ears
he
hardly
knows
himself
for
joy
and
how
smart
he
looks
in
that
uniform
how
well
the
blue
collar
suits
his
budding
dark
moustache
what
a
tall
elegant
figure
is
his
and
what
a
distinguished
walk
on
that
memorable
day
we
all
lunched
together
in
grandmamma
s
room
every
face
expressed
delight
and
with
the
dessert
which
followed
the
meal
the
servants
with
grave
but
gratified
faces
brought
in
bottles
of
champagne
grandmamma
for
the
first
time
since
mamma
s
death
drank
a
full
glass
of
the
wine
to
woloda
s
health
and
wept
for
joy
as
she
looked
at
him
henceforth
woloda
drove
his
own
invited
his
own
friends
smoked
and
went
to
balls
on
one
occasion
i
even
saw
him
sharing
a
couple
of
bottles
of
champagne
with
some
guests
in
his
room
and
the
whole
company
drinking
a
toast
with
each
glass
to
some
mysterious
being
and
then
quarrelling
as
to
who
should
have
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
nevertheless
he
always
lunched
at
home
and
after
the
meal
would
stretch
himself
on
a
sofa
and
talk
confidentially
to
katenka
yet
from
what
i
overheard
while
pretending
of
course
to
pay
no
attention
i
gathered
that
they
were
only
talking
of
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
novels
which
they
had
read
or
else
of
jealousy
and
love
and
so
on
never
could
i
understand
what
they
found
so
attractive
in
these
conversations
nor
why
they
smiled
so
happily
and
discussed
things
with
such
animation
altogether
i
could
see
that
in
addition
to
the
friendship
natural
to
persons
who
had
been
companions
from
childhood
there
existed
between
woloda
and
katenka
a
relation
which
differentiated
them
from
us
and
united
them
mysteriously
to
one
another
xxi
katenka
and
lubotshka
katenka
was
now
sixteen
years
old
quite
a
girl
and
although
at
that
age
the
angular
figures
the
bashfulness
and
the
gaucherie
peculiar
to
girls
passing
from
childhood
to
youth
usually
replace
the
comely
freshness
and
graceful
bloom
of
childhood
she
had
in
no
way
altered
still
the
blue
eyes
with
their
merry
glance
were
hers
the
nose
with
firm
nostrils
and
almost
forming
a
line
with
the
forehead
the
little
mouth
with
its
charming
smile
the
dimples
in
the
rosy
cheeks
and
the
small
white
hands
to
her
the
epithet
of
girl
pure
and
simple
was
applicable
for
in
her
the
only
new
features
were
a
new
and
arrangement
of
her
thick
flaxen
hair
and
a
youthful
bosom
the
latter
an
addition
which
at
once
caused
her
great
joy
and
made
her
very
bashful
although
lubotshka
and
she
had
grown
up
together
and
received
the
same
education
they
were
totally
unlike
one
another
lubotshka
was
not
tall
and
the
rickets
from
which
she
had
suffered
had
shaped
her
feet
in
goose
fashion
and
made
her
figure
very
bad
the
only
pretty
feature
in
her
face
was
her
eyes
which
were
indeed
wonderful
being
large
and
black
and
instinct
with
such
an
extremely
pleasing
expression
of
mingled
gravity
and
naivete
that
she
was
bound
to
attract
attention
in
everything
she
was
simple
and
natural
so
that
whereas
katenka
always
looked
as
though
she
were
trying
to
be
like
some
one
else
lubotshka
looked
people
straight
in
the
face
and
sometimes
fixed
them
so
long
with
her
splendid
black
eyes
that
she
got
blamed
for
doing
what
was
thought
to
be
improper
katenka
on
the
contrary
always
cast
her
eyelids
down
blinked
and
pretended
that
she
was
though
i
knew
very
well
that
her
sight
was
excellent
lubotshka
hated
being
shown
off
before
strangers
and
when
a
visitor
offered
to
kiss
her
she
invariably
grew
cross
and
said
that
she
hated
affection
whereas
when
strangers
were
present
katenka
was
always
particularly
endearing
to
mimi
and
loved
to
walk
about
the
room
arm
in
arm
with
another
girl
likewise
though
lubotshka
was
a
terrible
giggler
and
sometimes
ran
about
the
room
in
convulsions
of
gesticulating
laughter
katenka
always
covered
her
mouth
with
her
hands
or
her
when
she
wanted
to
laugh
lubotshka
again
loved
to
have
men
to
talk
to
and
said
that
some
day
she
meant
to
marry
a
hussar
but
katenka
always
pretended
that
all
men
were
horrid
and
that
she
never
meant
to
marry
any
one
of
them
while
as
soon
as
a
male
visitor
addressed
her
she
changed
completely
as
though
she
were
nervous
of
something
likewise
lubotshka
was
continually
at
loggerheads
with
mimi
because
the
latter
wanted
her
to
have
her
stays
so
tight
that
she
could
not
breathe
or
eat
or
drink
in
comfort
while
katenka
on
the
contrary
would
often
insert
her
finger
into
her
waistband
to
show
how
loose
it
was
and
always
ate
very
little
lubotshka
liked
to
draw
heads
katenka
only
flowers
and
butterflies
the
former
could
play
field
s
concertos
and
beethoven
s
sonatas
excellently
whereas
the
latter
indulged
in
variations
and
waltzes
retarded
the
time
and
used
the
pedals
continuously
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
before
she
began
she
invariably
struck
three
chords
in
arpeggio
nevertheless
in
those
days
i
thought
katenka
much
the
grander
person
of
the
two
and
liked
her
the
best
xxii
papa
papa
had
been
in
a
particularly
good
humour
ever
since
woloda
had
passed
into
the
university
and
came
much
oftener
to
dine
with
grandmamma
however
i
knew
from
nicola
that
he
had
won
a
great
deal
lately
occasionally
he
would
come
and
sit
with
us
in
the
evening
before
going
to
the
club
he
used
to
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
bid
us
group
ourselves
around
him
after
which
he
would
beat
time
with
his
thin
boots
he
detested
heels
and
never
wore
them
and
make
us
sing
gipsy
songs
at
such
times
you
should
have
seen
the
quaint
enthusiasm
of
his
beloved
lubotshka
who
adored
him
sometimes
again
he
would
come
to
the
schoolroom
and
listen
with
a
grave
face
as
i
said
my
lessons
yet
by
the
few
words
which
he
would
let
drop
when
correcting
me
i
could
see
that
he
knew
even
less
about
the
subject
than
i
did
not
infrequently
too
he
would
wink
at
us
and
make
secret
signs
when
grandmamma
was
beginning
to
scold
us
and
find
fault
with
us
all
round
so
much
for
us
children
he
would
say
on
the
whole
however
the
impossible
pinnacle
upon
which
my
childish
imagination
had
placed
him
had
undergone
a
certain
abasement
i
still
kissed
his
large
white
hand
with
a
certain
feeling
of
love
and
respect
but
i
also
allowed
myself
to
think
about
him
and
to
criticise
his
behaviour
until
involuntarily
thoughts
occurred
to
me
which
alarmed
me
by
their
presence
never
shall
i
forget
one
incident
in
particular
which
awakened
thoughts
of
this
kind
and
caused
me
intense
astonishment
late
one
evening
he
entered
the
in
his
black
and
white
waistcoat
to
take
woloda
who
was
still
dressing
in
his
bedroom
to
a
ball
grandmamma
was
also
in
her
bedroom
but
had
given
orders
that
before
setting
out
woloda
was
to
come
and
say
goodbye
to
her
it
was
her
invariable
custom
to
inspect
him
before
he
went
to
a
ball
and
to
bless
him
and
direct
him
as
to
his
behaviour
the
room
where
we
were
was
lighted
by
a
solitary
lamp
mimi
and
katenka
were
walking
up
and
down
and
lubotshka
was
playing
field
s
second
concerto
mamma
s
favourite
piece
at
the
piano
never
was
there
such
a
family
likeness
as
between
mamma
and
my
sister
not
so
much
in
the
face
or
the
stature
as
in
the
hands
the
walk
the
voice
the
favourite
expressions
and
above
all
the
way
of
playing
the
piano
and
the
whole
demeanour
at
the
instrument
lubotshka
always
arranged
her
dress
when
sitting
down
just
as
mamma
had
done
as
well
as
turned
the
leaves
like
her
tapped
her
fingers
angrily
and
said
dear
me
whenever
a
difficult
passage
did
not
go
smoothly
and
in
particular
played
with
the
delicacy
and
exquisite
purity
of
touch
which
in
those
days
caused
the
execution
of
field
s
music
to
be
known
characteristically
as
jeu
perle
and
to
lie
beyond
comparison
with
the
humbug
of
our
modern
virtuosi
papa
entered
the
room
with
short
soft
steps
and
approached
lubotshka
on
seeing
him
she
stopped
playing
no
go
on
luba
go
on
he
said
as
he
forced
her
to
sit
down
again
she
went
on
playing
while
papa
his
head
on
his
hand
sat
near
her
for
a
while
then
suddenly
he
gave
his
shoulders
a
shrug
and
rising
began
to
pace
the
room
every
time
that
he
approached
the
piano
he
halted
for
a
moment
and
looked
fixedly
at
lubotshka
by
his
walk
and
his
every
movement
i
could
see
that
he
was
greatly
agitated
once
when
he
stopped
behind
lubotshka
he
kissed
her
black
hair
and
then
wheeling
quickly
round
resumed
his
pacing
the
piece
finished
lubotshka
went
up
to
him
and
said
was
it
well
played
whereupon
without
answering
he
took
her
head
in
his
two
hands
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
eyes
with
such
tenderness
as
i
had
never
before
seen
him
display
why
you
are
crying
cried
lubotshka
suddenly
as
she
ceased
to
toy
with
his
and
stared
at
him
with
her
great
black
eyes
pardon
me
darling
papa
i
had
quite
forgotten
that
it
was
dear
mamma
s
piece
which
i
was
no
no
my
love
play
it
often
he
said
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
ah
if
you
only
knew
how
much
good
it
does
me
to
share
your
tears
he
kissed
her
again
and
then
mastering
his
feelings
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
went
to
the
door
leading
to
the
corridor
which
ran
past
woloda
s
room
waldemar
shall
you
be
ready
soon
he
cried
halting
in
the
middle
of
the
passage
just
then
masha
came
along
why
you
look
prettier
every
day
he
said
to
her
she
blushed
and
passed
on
waldemar
shall
you
be
ready
soon
he
cried
again
with
a
cough
and
a
shake
of
his
shoulders
just
as
masha
slipped
away
and
he
first
caught
sight
of
me
i
loved
papa
but
the
intellect
is
independent
of
the
heart
and
often
gives
birth
to
thoughts
which
offend
and
are
harsh
and
incomprehensible
to
the
feelings
and
it
was
thoughts
of
this
kind
that
for
all
i
strove
to
put
them
away
arose
at
that
moment
in
my
mind
xxiii
grandmamma
grandmamma
was
growing
weaker
every
day
her
bell
gasha
s
grumbling
voice
and
the
slamming
of
doors
in
her
room
were
sounds
of
constant
occurrence
and
she
no
longer
received
us
sitting
in
the
voltairian
in
her
boudoir
but
lying
on
the
bed
in
her
bedroom
supported
on
cushions
one
day
when
she
greeted
us
i
noticed
a
swelling
on
her
hand
and
smelt
the
same
oppressive
odour
which
i
had
smelt
five
years
ago
in
mamma
s
room
the
doctor
came
three
times
a
day
and
there
had
been
more
than
one
consultation
yet
the
character
of
her
haughty
ceremonious
bearing
towards
all
who
lived
with
her
and
particularly
towards
papa
never
changed
in
the
least
she
went
on
emphasising
certain
words
raising
her
eyebrows
and
saying
my
dear
just
as
she
had
always
done
then
for
a
few
days
we
did
not
see
her
at
all
and
one
morning
jerome
proposed
to
me
that
woloda
and
i
should
take
katenka
and
lubotshka
for
a
drive
during
the
hours
generally
allotted
to
study
although
i
observed
that
the
street
was
lined
with
straw
under
the
windows
of
grandmamma
s
room
and
that
some
men
in
blue
stockings
undertaker
s
men
were
standing
at
our
gate
the
reason
never
dawned
upon
me
why
we
were
being
sent
out
at
that
unusual
hour
throughout
the
drive
lubotshka
and
i
were
in
that
particularly
merry
mood
when
the
least
trifle
the
least
word
or
movement
sets
one
off
laughing
a
pedlar
went
trotting
across
the
road
with
a
tray
and
we
laughed
some
ragged
cabmen
brandishing
their
reins
and
driving
at
full
speed
overtook
our
sledge
and
we
laughed
again
next
philip
s
whip
got
caught
in
the
side
of
the
vehicle
and
the
way
in
which
he
said
bother
the
thing
as
he
drove
to
disentangle
it
almost
killed
us
with
mirth
mimi
looked
displeased
and
said
that
only
silly
people
laughed
for
no
reason
at
all
but
lubotshka
her
face
purple
with
suppressed
merriment
needed
but
to
give
me
a
sly
glance
and
we
again
burst
out
into
such
homeric
laughter
when
our
eyes
met
that
the
tears
rushed
into
them
and
we
could
not
stop
our
paroxysms
although
they
nearly
choked
us
hardly
again
had
we
desisted
a
little
when
i
looked
at
lubotshka
once
more
and
gave
vent
to
one
of
the
slang
words
which
we
then
affected
among
ourselves
words
which
always
called
forth
hilarity
and
in
a
moment
we
were
laughing
again
just
as
we
reached
home
i
was
opening
my
mouth
to
make
a
splendid
grimace
at
lubotshka
when
my
eye
fell
upon
a
black
which
was
leaning
against
the
gate
and
my
mouth
remained
fixed
in
its
gaping
position
your
grandmamma
is
dead
said
jerome
as
he
met
us
his
face
was
very
pale
throughout
the
whole
time
that
grandmamma
s
body
was
in
the
house
i
was
oppressed
with
the
fear
of
death
for
the
corpse
served
as
a
forcible
and
disagreeable
reminder
that
i
too
must
die
some
day
a
feeling
which
people
often
mistake
for
grief
i
had
no
sincere
regret
for
grandmamma
nor
i
think
had
any
one
else
since
although
the
house
was
full
of
sympathising
callers
nobody
seemed
to
mourn
for
her
from
their
hearts
except
one
mourner
whose
genuine
grief
made
a
great
impression
upon
me
seeing
that
the
mourner
in
question
was
gasha
she
shut
herself
up
in
the
garret
tore
her
hair
and
refused
all
consolation
saying
that
now
that
her
mistress
was
dead
she
only
wished
to
die
herself
i
again
assert
that
in
matters
of
feeling
it
is
the
unexpected
effects
that
constitute
the
most
reliable
signs
of
sincerity
though
grandmamma
was
no
longer
with
us
reminiscences
and
gossip
about
her
long
went
on
in
the
house
such
gossip
referred
mostly
to
her
will
which
she
had
made
shortly
before
her
death
and
of
which
as
yet
no
one
knew
the
contents
except
her
bosom
friend
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
i
could
hear
the
servants
talking
excitedly
together
and
making
innumerable
conjectures
as
to
the
amount
left
and
the
probable
beneficiaries
nor
can
i
deny
that
the
idea
that
we
ourselves
were
probably
the
latter
greatly
pleased
me
six
weeks
later
nicola
who
acted
as
regular
to
the
house
informed
me
that
grandmamma
had
left
the
whole
of
her
fortune
to
lubotshka
with
as
her
trustee
until
her
majority
not
papa
but
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
xxiv
myself
only
a
few
months
remained
before
i
was
to
matriculate
for
the
university
yet
i
was
making
such
good
progress
that
i
felt
no
apprehensions
and
even
took
a
pleasure
in
my
studies
i
kept
in
good
heart
and
learnt
my
lessons
fluently
and
intelligently
the
faculty
i
had
selected
was
the
mathematical
one
probably
to
tell
the
truth
because
the
terms
tangent
differentials
integrals
and
so
forth
pleased
my
fancy
though
stout
and
i
was
shorter
than
woloda
while
my
ugliness
of
face
still
remained
and
tormented
me
as
much
as
ever
by
way
of
compensation
i
tried
to
appear
original
yet
one
thing
comforted
me
namely
that
papa
had
said
that
i
had
an
intelligent
i
quite
believed
him
jerome
was
not
only
satisfied
with
me
but
actually
had
taken
to
praising
me
consequently
i
had
now
ceased
to
hate
him
in
fact
when
one
day
he
said
that
with
my
capacities
and
my
intellect
it
would
be
shameful
for
me
not
to
accomplish
this
that
or
the
other
thing
i
believe
i
almost
liked
him
i
had
long
ago
given
up
keeping
observation
on
the
maidservants
room
for
i
was
now
ashamed
to
hide
behind
doors
likewise
i
confess
that
the
knowledge
of
masha
s
love
for
basil
had
greatly
cooled
my
ardour
for
her
and
that
my
passion
underwent
a
final
cure
by
their
marriage
a
consummation
to
which
i
myself
contributed
by
at
basil
s
request
asking
papa
s
consent
to
the
union
when
the
couple
brought
trays
of
cakes
and
sweetmeats
to
papa
as
a
and
masha
in
a
cap
with
blue
ribbons
kissed
each
of
us
on
the
shoulder
in
token
of
her
gratitude
i
merely
noticed
the
scent
of
the
rose
pomade
on
her
hair
but
felt
no
other
sensation
in
general
i
was
beginning
to
get
the
better
of
my
youthful
defects
with
the
exception
of
the
principal
one
the
one
of
which
i
shall
often
again
have
to
speak
in
relating
my
life
s
history
namely
the
tendency
to
abstract
thought
xxv
woloda
s
friends
although
when
in
the
society
of
woloda
s
friends
i
had
to
play
a
part
that
hurt
my
pride
i
liked
sitting
in
his
room
when
he
had
visitors
and
silently
watching
all
they
did
the
two
who
came
most
frequently
to
see
him
were
a
military
adjutant
called
dubkoff
and
a
student
named
prince
nechludoff
dubkoff
was
a
little
man
who
though
short
of
stature
and
no
longer
in
his
first
youth
had
a
pleasing
and
invariably
cheerful
air
his
was
one
of
those
limited
natures
which
are
agreeable
through
their
very
limitations
natures
which
can
not
regard
matters
from
every
point
of
view
but
which
are
nevertheless
attracted
by
everything
usually
the
reasoning
of
such
persons
is
false
and
yet
always
genuine
and
taking
wherefore
their
narrow
egotism
seems
both
amiable
and
excusable
there
were
two
other
reasons
why
dubkoff
had
charms
for
woloda
and
myself
namely
the
fact
that
he
was
of
military
appearance
and
secondly
and
principally
the
fact
that
he
was
of
a
certain
age
an
age
with
which
young
people
are
apt
to
associate
that
quality
of
gentlemanliness
which
is
so
highly
esteemed
at
their
time
of
life
however
he
was
in
very
truth
un
homme
comme
il
faut
the
only
thing
which
i
did
not
like
about
it
all
was
that
in
his
presence
woloda
always
seemed
ashamed
of
my
innocent
behaviour
and
still
more
so
of
my
youthfulness
as
for
prince
nechludoff
he
was
in
no
way
handsome
since
neither
his
small
grey
eyes
his
low
projecting
forehead
nor
his
disproportionately
long
hands
and
feet
could
be
called
good
features
the
only
good
points
about
him
were
his
unusually
tall
stature
his
delicate
colouring
and
his
splendid
teeth
nevertheless
his
face
was
of
such
an
original
energetic
character
owing
to
his
narrow
sparkling
eyes
and
expression
now
stern
now
childlike
now
smiling
indeterminately
that
it
was
impossible
to
help
noticing
it
as
a
rule
he
was
very
shy
and
would
blush
to
the
ears
at
the
smallest
trifle
but
it
was
a
shyness
altogether
different
from
mine
seeing
that
the
more
he
blushed
the
more
he
grew
as
though
he
were
vexed
at
his
own
weakness
although
he
was
on
very
good
terms
with
woloda
and
dubkoff
it
was
clearly
chance
which
had
united
them
thus
since
their
tastes
were
entirely
dissimilar
woloda
and
dubkoff
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
anything
like
serious
consideration
or
emotion
whereas
nechludoff
was
beyond
all
things
an
enthusiast
and
would
often
despite
their
sarcastic
remarks
plunge
into
dissertations
on
philosophical
matters
or
matters
of
feeling
again
the
two
former
liked
talking
about
the
fair
objects
of
their
adoration
these
were
always
numerous
and
always
shared
by
the
friends
in
common
whereas
nechludoff
invariably
grew
annoyed
when
taxed
with
his
love
for
a
certain
lady
again
woloda
and
dubkoff
often
permitted
themselves
to
criticise
their
relatives
and
to
find
amusement
in
so
doing
but
nechludoff
flew
into
a
tremendous
rage
when
on
one
occasion
they
referred
to
some
weak
points
in
the
character
of
an
aunt
of
his
whom
he
adored
finally
after
supper
woloda
and
dubkoff
would
usually
go
off
to
some
place
whither
nechludoff
would
not
accompany
them
wherefore
they
called
him
a
dainty
the
very
first
time
that
i
ever
saw
prince
nechludoff
i
was
struck
with
his
exterior
and
conversation
yet
though
i
could
discern
a
great
similarity
between
his
disposition
and
my
own
or
perhaps
it
was
because
i
could
so
discern
it
the
impression
which
he
produced
upon
me
at
first
was
anything
but
agreeable
i
liked
neither
his
quick
glance
his
hard
voice
his
proud
bearing
nor
least
of
all
the
utter
indifference
with
which
he
treated
me
often
when
conversing
i
burned
to
contradict
him
to
punish
his
pride
by
confuting
him
to
show
him
that
i
was
clever
in
spite
of
his
disdainful
neglect
of
my
presence
but
i
was
invariably
prevented
from
doing
so
by
my
shyness
xxvi
discussions
woloda
was
lying
reading
a
french
novel
on
the
sofa
when
i
paid
my
usual
visit
to
his
room
after
my
evening
lessons
he
looked
up
at
me
for
a
moment
from
his
book
and
then
went
on
reading
this
perfectly
simple
and
natural
movement
however
offended
me
i
conceived
that
the
glance
implied
a
question
why
i
had
come
and
a
wish
to
hide
his
thoughts
from
me
i
may
say
that
at
that
period
a
tendency
to
attach
a
meaning
to
the
most
insignificant
of
acts
formed
a
prominent
feature
in
my
character
so
i
went
to
the
table
and
also
took
up
a
book
to
read
yet
even
before
i
had
actually
begun
reading
the
idea
struck
me
how
ridiculous
it
was
that
although
we
had
never
seen
one
another
all
day
we
should
have
not
a
word
to
exchange
are
you
going
to
stay
in
woloda
i
don
t
know
why
oh
because
seeing
that
the
conversation
did
not
promise
to
be
a
success
i
took
up
my
book
again
and
began
to
read
yet
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
though
we
sometimes
passed
whole
hours
together
without
speaking
when
we
were
alone
the
mere
presence
of
a
third
sometimes
of
a
taciturn
and
wholly
uninteresting
person
sufficed
to
plunge
us
into
the
most
varied
and
engrossing
of
discussions
the
truth
was
that
we
knew
one
another
too
well
and
to
know
a
person
either
too
well
or
too
little
acts
as
a
bar
to
intimacy
is
woloda
at
home
came
in
dubkoff
s
voice
from
the
yes
shouted
woloda
springing
up
and
throwing
aside
his
book
dubkoff
and
nechludoff
entered
are
you
coming
to
the
theatre
woloda
no
i
have
no
time
he
replied
with
a
blush
oh
never
mind
that
come
but
i
haven
t
got
a
tickets
as
many
as
you
like
at
the
very
well
then
i
ll
be
back
in
a
minute
said
woloda
evasively
as
he
left
the
room
i
knew
very
well
that
he
wanted
to
go
but
that
he
had
declined
because
he
had
no
money
and
had
now
gone
to
borrow
five
roubles
of
one
of
the
servants
to
be
repaid
when
he
got
his
next
allowance
how
do
you
do
diplomat
said
dubkoff
to
me
as
he
shook
me
by
the
hand
woloda
s
friends
had
called
me
by
that
nickname
since
the
day
when
grandmamma
had
said
at
luncheon
that
woloda
must
go
into
the
army
but
that
she
would
like
to
see
me
in
the
diplomatic
service
dressed
in
a
black
and
with
my
hair
arranged
a
la
coq
the
two
essential
requirements
in
her
opinion
of
a
diplomat
where
has
woloda
gone
to
asked
nechludoff
i
don
t
know
i
replied
blushing
to
think
that
nevertheless
they
had
probably
guessed
his
errand
i
suppose
he
has
no
money
yes
i
can
see
i
am
right
o
diplomatist
he
added
taking
my
smile
as
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
well
i
have
none
either
have
you
any
dubkoff
i
ll
see
replied
dubkoff
feeling
for
his
pocket
and
rummaging
gingerly
about
with
his
squat
little
fingers
among
his
small
change
yes
here
are
five
but
that
s
all
he
concluded
with
a
comic
gesture
of
his
hand
at
this
point
woloda
are
we
going
what
an
odd
fellow
you
are
said
nechludoff
why
don
t
you
say
that
you
have
no
money
here
take
my
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
can
go
into
his
cousin
s
box
said
dubkoff
no
i
m
not
going
at
all
replied
nechludoff
why
because
i
hate
sitting
in
a
and
for
what
reason
i
don
t
know
somehow
i
feel
uncomfortable
always
the
same
i
can
t
understand
a
fellow
feeling
uncomfortable
when
he
is
sitting
with
people
who
are
fond
of
him
it
is
unnatural
mon
but
what
else
is
there
to
be
done

suis
tant
timide
you
never
blushed
in
your
life
but
i
do
at
the
least
trifle
and
he
blushed
at
that
moment
do
you
know
what
that
nervousness
of
yours
proceeds
from
said
dubkoff
in
a
protecting
sort
of
tone
d
un
exces
d
amour
propre
mon
what
do
you
mean
by
exces
d
amour
propre
asked
nechludoff
highly
offended
on
the
contrary
i
am
shy
just
because
i
have
too
little
amour
propre
i
always
feel
as
though
i
were
being
tiresome
and
disagreeable
and
therefore
well
get
ready
woloda
interrupted
dubkoff
tapping
my
brother
on
the
shoulder
and
handing
him
his
cloak
ignaz
get
your
master
therefore
continued
nechludoff
it
often
happens
with
me
that
but
dubkoff
was
not
listening
and
he
hummed
a
popular
air
oh
but
i
m
not
going
to
let
you
off
went
on
nechludoff
i
mean
to
prove
to
you
that
my
shyness
is
not
the
result
of
you
can
prove
it
as
we
go
but
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
not
well
then
stay
here
and
prove
it
to
the
diplomat
and
he
can
tell
us
all
about
it
when
we
yes
that
s
what
i
will
do
said
nechludoff
with
boyish
obstinacy
so
hurry
up
with
your
well
do
you
think
i
am
egotistic
he
continued
seating
himself
beside
me
true
i
had
a
definite
opinion
on
the
subject
but
i
felt
so
taken
aback
by
this
unexpected
question
that
at
first
i
could
make
no
reply
yes
i
do
think
so
i
said
at
length
in
a
faltering
voice
and
colouring
at
the
thought
that
at
last
the
moment
had
come
when
i
could
show
him
that
i
was
clever
i
think
that
everybody
is
egotistic
and
that
everything
we
do
is
done
out
of
but
what
do
you
call
egotism
asked
nechludoff
smiling
as
i
thought
a
little
contemptuously
egotism
is
a
conviction
that
we
are
better
and
cleverer
than
any
one
else
i
replied
but
how
can
we
all
be
filled
with
this
conviction
he
inquired
well
i
don
t
know
if
i
am
right
or
not
certainly
no
one
but
myself
seems
to
hold
the
opinion
but
i
believe
that
i
am
wiser
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
that
all
of
you
know
at
least
i
can
say
for
myself
observed
nechludoff
that
i
have
met
a
few
people
whom
i
believe
to
excel
me
in
it
is
impossible
i
replied
with
conviction
do
you
really
think
so
he
said
looking
at
me
gravely
yes
really
i
answered
and
an
idea
crossed
my
mind
which
i
proceeded
to
expound
further
let
me
prove
it
to
you
why
do
we
love
ourselves
better
than
any
one
else
because
we
think
ourselves
better
than
any
one
else
more
worthy
of
our
own
love
if
we
thought
others
better
than
ourselves
we
should
love
them
better
than
ourselves
but
that
is
never
the
case
and
even
if
it
were
so
i
should
still
be
right
i
added
with
an
involuntary
smile
of
complacency
for
a
few
minutes
nechludoff
was
silent
i
never
thought
you
were
so
clever
he
said
with
a
smile
so
goodhumoured
and
charming
that
i
at
once
felt
happy
praise
exercises
an
influence
not
only
upon
the
feelings
but
also
upon
the
intellect
so
that
under
the
influence
of
that
agreeable
sensation
i
straightway
felt
much
cleverer
than
before
and
thoughts
began
to
rush
with
extraordinary
rapidity
through
my
head
from
egotism
we
passed
insensibly
to
the
theme
of
love
which
seemed
inexhaustible
although
our
reasonings
might
have
sounded
nonsensical
to
a
listener
so
vague
and
were
they
for
ourselves
they
had
a
profound
significance
our
minds
were
so
perfectly
in
harmony
that
not
a
chord
was
struck
in
the
one
without
awakening
an
echo
in
the
other
and
in
this
harmonious
striking
of
different
chords
we
found
the
greatest
delight
indeed
we
felt
as
though
time
and
language
were
insufficient
to
express
the
thoughts
which
seethed
within
us
xxvii
the
beginning
of
our
friendship
from
that
time
forth
a
strange
but
exceedingly
pleasant
relation
subsisted
between
dimitri
nechludoff
and
myself
before
other
people
he
paid
me
scanty
attention
but
as
soon
as
ever
we
were
alone
we
would
sit
down
together
in
some
comfortable
corner
and
forgetful
both
of
time
and
of
everything
around
us
fall
to
reasoning
we
talked
of
a
future
life
of
art
service
marriage
and
education
nor
did
the
idea
ever
occur
to
us
that
very
possibly
all
we
said
was
shocking
nonsense
the
reason
why
it
never
occurred
to
us
was
that
the
nonsense
which
we
talked
was
good
sensible
nonsense
and
that
so
long
as
one
is
young
one
can
appreciate
good
nonsense
and
believe
in
it
in
youth
the
powers
of
the
mind
are
directed
wholly
to
the
future
and
that
future
assumes
such
various
vivid
and
alluring
forms
under
the
influence
of
hope
hope
based
not
upon
the
experience
of
the
past
but
upon
an
assumed
possibility
of
happiness
to
come
that
such
dreams
of
expected
felicity
constitute
in
themselves
the
true
happiness
of
that
period
of
our
life
how
i
loved
those
moments
in
our
metaphysical
discussions
discussions
which
formed
the
major
portion
of
our
intercourse
when
thoughts
came
thronging
faster
and
faster
and
succeeding
one
another
at
lightning
speed
and
growing
more
and
more
abstract
at
length
attained
such
a
pitch
of
elevation
that
one
felt
powerless
to
express
them
and
said
something
quite
different
from
what
one
had
intended
at
first
to
say
how
i
liked
those
moments
too
when
carried
higher
and
higher
into
the
realms
of
thought
we
suddenly
felt
that
we
could
grasp
its
substance
no
longer
and
go
no
further
at
carnival
time
nechludoff
was
so
much
taken
up
with
one
festivity
and
another
that
though
he
came
to
see
us
several
times
a
day
he
never
addressed
a
single
word
to
me
this
offended
me
so
much
that
once
again
i
found
myself
thinking
him
a
haughty
disagreeable
fellow
and
only
awaited
an
opportunity
to
show
him
that
i
no
longer
valued
his
company
or
felt
any
particular
affection
for
him
accordingly
the
first
time
that
he
spoke
to
me
after
the
carnival
i
said
that
i
had
lessons
to
do
and
went
upstairs
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
some
one
opened
the
schoolroom
door
and
nechludoff
entered
am
i
disturbing
you
he
asked
no
i
replied
although
i
had
at
first
intended
to
say
that
i
had
a
great
deal
to
do
then
why
did
you
run
away
just
now
it
is
a
long
while
since
we
had
a
talk
together
and
i
have
grown
so
accustomed
to
these
discussions
that
i
feel
as
though
something
were
my
anger
had
quite
gone
now
and
dimitri
stood
before
me
the
same
good
and
lovable
being
as
before
you
know
perhaps
why
i
ran
away
i
said
perhaps
i
do
he
answered
taking
a
seat
near
me
however
though
it
is
possible
i
know
why
i
can
not
say
it
straight
out
whereas
you
then
i
will
do
so
i
ran
away
because
i
was
angry
with
you
well
not
angry
but
grieved
i
always
have
an
idea
that
you
despise
me
for
being
so
well
do
you
know
why
i
always
feel
so
attracted
towards
you
he
replied
meeting
my
confession
with
a
look
of
kind
understanding
and
why
i
like
you
better
than
any
of
my
other
acquaintances
or
than
any
of
the
people
among
whom
i
mostly
have
to
live
it
is
because
i
found
out
at
once
that
you
have
the
rare
and
astonishing
gift
of
yes
i
always
confess
the
things
of
which
i
am
most
ashamed
but
only
to
people
in
whom
i
trust
i
said
ah
but
to
trust
a
man
you
must
be
his
friend
completely
and
we
are
not
friends
yet
nicolas
remember
how
when
we
were
speaking
of
friendship
we
agreed
that
to
be
real
friends
we
ought
to
trust
one
another
i
trust
you
in
so
far
as
that
i
feel
convinced
that
you
would
never
repeat
a
word
of
what
i
might
tell
you
i
said
yet
perhaps
the
most
interesting
and
important
thoughts
of
all
are
just
those
which
we
never
tell
one
another
while
the
mean
thoughts
the
thoughts
which
if
we
only
knew
that
we
had
to
confess
them
to
one
another
would
probably
never
have
the
hardihood
to
enter
our
minds
well
do
you
know
what
i
am
thinking
of
nicolas
he
broke
off
rising
and
taking
my
hand
with
a
smile
i
propose
and
i
feel
sure
that
it
would
benefit
us
mutually
that
we
should
pledge
our
word
to
one
another
to
tell
each
other
everything
we
should
then
really
know
each
other
and
never
have
anything
on
our
consciences
and
to
guard
against
outsiders
let
us
also
agree
never
to
speak
of
one
another
to
a
third
person
suppose
we
do
that
i
agree
i
replied
and
we
did
it
what
the
result
was
shall
be
told
hereafter
kerr
has
said
that
every
attachment
has
two
sides
one
loves
and
the
other
allows
himself
to
be
loved
one
kisses
and
the
other
surrenders
his
cheek
that
is
perfectly
true
in
the
case
of
our
own
attachment
it
was
i
who
kissed
and
dimitri
who
surrendered
his
cheek
though
he
in
his
turn
was
ready
to
pay
me
a
similar
salute
we
loved
equally
because
we
knew
and
appreciated
each
other
thoroughly
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
exercising
an
influence
over
me
nor
myself
from
rendering
him
adoration
it
will
readily
be
understood
that
nechludoff
s
influence
caused
me
to
adopt
his
bent
of
mind
the
essence
of
which
lay
in
an
enthusiastic
reverence
for
ideal
virtue
and
a
firm
belief
in
man
s
vocation
to
perpetual
perfection
to
raise
mankind
to
abolish
vice
and
misery
seemed
at
that
time
a
task
offering
no
difficulties
to
educate
oneself
to
every
virtue
and
so
to
achieve
happiness
seemed
a
simple
and
easy
matter
only
god
himself
knows
whether
those
blessed
dreams
of
youth
were
ridiculous
or
whose
the
fault
was
that
they
never
became
realised
