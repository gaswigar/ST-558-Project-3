oracle
foretold
that
the
child
born
to
him
by
his

slay
his
father
and
wed
his
mother
so
when
in
time

were
riveted

was
indeed
the

doubting
his
parentage
he
inquired
of
the
delphic
god
and
heard
himself
the
word
declared
before
to
laius
wherefore
he
fled
from
what
he
deemed
his
father
house
and
in
his
flight
he
encountered
and
unwillingly
slew
his
father
laius
arriving
at
thebes
he
answered
the
riddle
of
the
sphinx
and
the

oedipus
my
sovereign
lord
and
king
thou
seest
how
both
extremes
of
age
besiege
thy
palace
altars
fledglings
hardly
winged
and
greybeards
bowed
with
years
priests
as
am

and
these

our
ship
of

sore
buffeted
can
no
more
lift
her
head
foundered
beneath
a
weltering
surge
of
blood
a
blight
is
on
our
harvest
in
the
ear
a
blight
upon
the
grazing
flocks
and
herds
a
blight
on
wives
in
travail
and
withal
armed
with
his
blazing
torch
the
god
of
plague
hath
swooped
upon
our
city
emptying
the
house
of
cadmus
and
the
murky
realm
of
pluto
is
full
fed
with
groans
and
tears
therefore
o
king
here
at
thy
hearth
we
sit
i
and
these
children
not
as
deeming
thee
a
new
divinity
but
the
first
of
men
first
in
the
common
accidents
of
life
and
first
in
visitations
of
the
gods
art
thou
not
he
who
coming
to
the
town
of
cadmus
freed
us
from
the
tax
we
paid
to
the
fell
songstress
nor
hadst
thou
received
prompting
from
us
or
been
by
others
schooled
no
by
a
god
inspired
so
all
men
deem
and
testify
didst
thou
renew
our
life
and
now
o
oedipus
our
peerless
king
all
we
thy
votaries
beseech
thee
find
some
succor
whether
by
a
voice
from
heaven
whispered
or
haply
known
by
human
wit
tried
counselors
methinks
are
aptest
found

furnish

the

upraise
our
state
look
to
thy
laurels
for
thy
zeal
of
yore
our
country
savior
thou
art
justly
hailed
o
never
may
we
thus
record
thy
reign

raised
us
up
only
to
cast
us
down

us

our
city
on
a
rock

happy
star
ascendant

us
luck
o
let
it
not
decline
if
thou
wouldst
rule
this
land
as
now
thou
reignest
better

a

oedipus
ah
my
poor
children
known
ah
known
too
well
the
quest
that
brings
you
hither
and
your
need
ye
sicken
all
well
wot
i
yet
my
pain
how
great
soever
yours
outtops
it
all
your
sorrow
touches
each
man
severally
him
and
none
other
but
i
grieve
at
once
both
for
the
general
and
myself
and
you
therefore
ye
rouse
no
sluggard
from
many
my
children
are
the
tears
i
wept
and
threaded
many
a
maze
of
weary
thought
thus
pondering
one
clue
of
hope
i
caught
and
tracked
it
up
i
have
sent
menoeceus
son
creon
my
consort
brother
to
inquire
of
pythian
phoebus
at
his
delphic
shrine
how
i
might
save
the
state
by
act
or
word
and
now
i
reckon
up
the
tale
of
days
since
he
set
forth
and
marvel
how
he
fares
is
strange
this
endless
tarrying
passing
strange
but
when
he
comes
then
i
were
base
indeed
if
i
perform
not
all
the
god
declares
priest
thy
words
are
well
timed
even
as
thou
speakest
that
shouting
tells
me
creon
is
at
hand
oedipus
o
king
apollo
may
his
joyous
looks
be
presage
of
the
joyous
news
he
brings
priest
as
i
surmise
is
welcome
else
his
head
had
scarce
been
crowned
with
bays
oedipus
we
soon
shall
know
he
now
in
earshot
range
enter
creon
my
royal
cousin
say
menoeceus
child
what
message
hast
thou
brought
us
from
the
god
creon
good
news
for
intolerable
ills
finding
right
issue
tend
to
naught
but
good
oedipus
how
runs
the
oracle
thus
far
thy
words
give
me
no
ground
for
confidence
or
fear
creon
if
thou
wouldst
hear
my
message
publicly
i
tell
thee
straight
or
with
thee
pass
within
oedipus
speak
before
all
the
burden
that
i
bear
is
more
for
these
my
subjects
than
myself
creon
let
me
report
then
all
the
god
declared
king
phoebus
bids
us
straitly
extirpate
a
fell
pollution
that
infests
the
land
and
no
more
harbor
an
inveterate
sore
oedipus
what
expiation
means
he
what
amiss
creon
banishment
or
the
shedding
blood
for
blood
this
stain
of
blood
makes
shipwreck
of
our
state
oedipus
whom
can
he
mean
the
miscreant
thus
denounced
creon
before
thou
didst
assume
the
helm
of
state
the
sovereign
of
this
land
was
laius
oedipus
i
heard
as
much
but
never
saw
the
man
creon
he
fell
and
now
the
god
command
is
plain
punish
his
they
be
oedipus
where
are
they
where
in
the
wide
world
to
find
the
far
faint
traces
of
a
bygone
crime
creon
in
this
land
said
the
god
who
seeks
shall
find
who
sits
with
folded
hands
or
sleeps
is
blind
oedipus
was
he
within
his
palace
or
afield
or
traveling
when
laius
met
his
fate
creon
abroad
he
started
so
he
told
us
bound
for
delphi
but
he
never
thence
returned
oedipus
came
there
no
news
no
to
give
some
clue
that
might
be
followed
up
creon
but
one
escape
who
flying
for
dear
life
could
tell
of
all
he
saw
but
one
thing
sure
oedipus
and
what
was
that
one
clue
might
lead
us
far
with
but
a
spark
of
hope
to
guide
our
quest
creon
robbers
he
told
us
not
one
bandit
but
a
troop
of
knaves
attacked
and
murdered
him
oedipus
did
any
bandit
dare
so
bold
a
stroke
unless
indeed
he
were
suborned
from
thebes
creon
so
was
surmised
but
none
was
found
to
avenge
his
murder
mid
the
trouble
that
ensued
oedipus
what
trouble
can
have
hindered
a
full
quest
when
royalty
had
fallen
thus
miserably
creon
the
riddling
sphinx
compelled
us
to
let
slide
the
dim
past
and
attend
to
instant
needs
oedipus
well
will
start
afresh
and
once
again
make
dark
things
clear
right
worthy
the
concern
of
phoebus
worthy
thine
too
for
the
dead
i

is
meet

lend
my
aid
to
avenge
this
wrong

poison
in

blood
for
whoso
slew

is
banishment
unscathed
he

ye

no
man
in
this

whereof
i
hold
the
sovereign
rule
harbor
or

him
no
part
in

hound
him
from

homes
for
this
is
our
defilement
so
the
god
hath
lately
shown
to
me
by
oracles
thus
as
their
champion
i
maintain
the
cause
both
of
the
god
and
of
the
murdered
king
and
on
the
murderer
this
curse
i
lay
on
him
and
all
the
partners
in
his
guilt
wretch
may
he
pine
in
utter
wretchedness
and
for
myself
if
with
my
privity
he
gain
admittance
to
my
hearth
i
pray
the
curse
i
laid
on
others
fall
on
me
see
that
ye
give
effect
to
all
my
hest
for
my
sake
and
the
god
and
for
our
land
a
desert
blasted
by
the
wrath
of
heaven
for
let
alone
the
god
express
command
it
were
a
scandal
ye
should
leave
unpurged
the
murder
of
a
great
man
and
your
king
nor
track
it
home
and
now
that
i
am
lord
successor
to
his
throne
his
bed
his
wife
and
had
he
not
been
frustrate
in
the
hope
of
issue
common
children
of
one
womb
had
forced
a
closer
bond
twixt
him
and
me
but
fate
swooped
down
upon
him
therefore
i
his
will
maintain
his
cause
as
though
he
were
my
sire
and
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
track
the
assassin
or
avenge
the
son
of
labdacus
of
polydore
of
cadmus
and
agenor
first
of
the
race
and
for
the
disobedient
thus
i
pray
may
the
gods
send
them
neither
timely
fruits
of
earth
nor
teeming
increase
of
the
womb
but
may
they
waste
and
pine
as
now
they
waste
aye
and
worse
stricken
but
to
all
of
you
my
loyal
subjects
who
approve
my
acts
may
justice
our
ally
and
all
the
gods
be
gracious
and
attend
you
evermore
chorus
the
oath
thou
profferest
sire
i
take
and
swear
i
slew
him
not
myself
nor
can
i
name
the
slayer
for
the
quest
well
methinks
that
phoebus
who
proposed
the
riddle
himself
should
give
the
answer
who
the
murderer
was
oedipus
well
argued
but
no
living
man
can
hope
to
force
the
gods
to
speak
against
their
will
chorus
may
i
then
say
what
seems
next
best
to
me
oedipus
aye
if
there
be
a
third
best
tell
it
too
chorus
my
liege
if
any
man
sees
eye
to
eye
with
our
lord
phoebus
is
our
prophet
lord
teiresias
he
of
all
men
best
might
guide
a
searcher
of
this
matter
to
the
light
oedipus
here
too
my
zeal
has
nothing
lagged
for
twice
at
creon
instance
have
i
sent
to
fetch
him
and
long
i
marvel
why
he
is
not
here
chorus
i
mind
me
too
of
rumors
long
ago
mere
gossip
oedipus
tell
them
i
would
fain
know
all
chorus
said
he
fell
by
travelers
oedipus
so
i
heard
but
none
has
seen
the

the

thy
curse
oedipus

at

they

truth
inborn
enter
teiresias
led
by
a
boy
oedipus
teiresias
seer
who
comprehendest
all
lore
of
the
wise
and
hidden
mysteries
high
things
of
heaven
and
low
things
of
the
earth
thou
knowest
though
thy
blinded
eyes
see
naught
what
plague
infects
our
city
and
we
turn
to
thee
o
seer
our
one
defense
and
shield
the
purport
of
the
answer
that
the
god
returned
to
us
who
sought
his
oracle
the
messengers
have
doubtless
told
thee
how
one
course
alone
could
rid
us
of
the
pest
to
find
the
murderers
of
laius
and
slay
them
or
expel
them
from

therefore
begrudging
neither
augury
nor
other
divination

is
thine
o
save
thyself
thy
country
and
thy
king
save
all
from
this
defilement
of

shed
on

we
rest
this

highest

service
all
his

teiresias
alas
alas
what
misery
to
be
wise
when
wisdom
profits
nothing
this
old
lore
i
had
forgotten

i
were
not
here
oedipus
what
ails
thee
why
this
melancholy
mood
teiresias
let
me
go
home
prevent
me
not
best
that
thou
shouldst
bear
thy
burden
and
i
mine
oedipus
for
shame
no
theban
patriot
would
thus
withhold
the
word
of
prophecy
teiresias
words
o
king
are
wide
of
the
mark
and
i
for
fear
lest
i
too
trip
like
thee
oedipus
oh
speak
withhold
not
i
adjure
thee
if
thou
thy
knowledge
we
are
all
thy
suppliants
teiresias
aye
for
ye
all
are
witless
but
my
voice
will
reveal
my
miseries
or
thine
oedipus
what
then
thou
knowest
and
yet
willst
not
speak
wouldst
thou
betray
us
and
destroy
the
state
teiresias
i
will
not
vex
myself
nor
thee
why
ask
thus
idly
what
from
me
thou
shalt
not
learn
oedipus
monster
thy
silence
would
incense
a
flint
will
nothing
loose
thy
tongue
can
nothing
melt
thee
or
shake
thy
dogged
taciturnity
teiresias
thou
my
mood
and
seest
not
thine
own
wherewith
thou
art
mated
no
thou
taxest
me
oedipus
and
who
could
stay
his
choler
when
he
heard
how
insolently
thou
dost
flout
the
state
teiresias
well
it
will
come
what
will
though
i
be
mute
oedipus
since
come
it
must
thy
duty
is
to
tell
me
teiresias
i
have
no
more
to
say
storm
as
thou
willst
and
give
the
rein
to
all
thy
rage
oedipus
yea
i
am
wroth
and
will
not
stint
my
words
but
speak
my
whole
mind
thou
methinks
thou
art
he
who
planned
the
crime
aye
and
performed
it
too
all
save
the
assassination
and
if
thou
hadst
not
been
blind
i
had
been
sworn
to
boot
that
thou
alone
didst
do
the
bloody
deed
teiresias
is
it
so
then
i
charge
thee
to
abide
by
thine
own
proclamation
from
this
day
speak
not
to
these
or
me
thou
art
the
man
thou
the
accursed
polluter
of
this
land
oedipus
vile
slanderer
thou
blurtest
forth
these
taunts
and
forsooth
as
seer
to
go
scot
free
teiresias
yea
i
am
free
strong
in
the
strength
of
truth
oedipus
who
was
thy
teacher
not
methinks
thy
art
teiresias
thou
goading
me
against
my
will
to
speak
oedipus
what
speech
repeat
it
and
resolve
my
doubt
teiresias
didst
miss
my
sense
wouldst
thou
goad
me
on
oedipus
i
but
half
caught
thy
meaning
say
it
again
teiresias
i
say
thou
art
the
murderer
of
the
man
whose
murderer
thou
pursuest
oedipus
thou
shalt
rue
it
twice
to
repeat
so
gross
a
calumny
teiresias
must
i
say
more
to
aggravate
thy
rage
oedipus
say
all
thou
wilt
it
will
be
but
waste
of
breath
teiresias
i
say
thou
livest
with
thy
nearest
kin
in
infamy
unwitting
in
thy
shame
oedipus
thou
for
aye
unscathed
to
wag
thy
tongue
teiresias
yea
if
the
might
of
truth
can
aught
prevail
oedipus
with
other
men
but
not
with
thee
for
thou
in
ear
wit
eye
in
everything
art
blind
teiresias
poor
fool
to
utter
gibes
at
me
which
all
here
present
will
cast
back
on
thee
ere
long
oedipus
offspring
of
endless
night
thou
hast
no
power
me
or
any
man
who
sees
the
sun
teiresias
no
for
thy
weird
is
not
to
fall
by
me
i
leave
to
apollo
what
concerns
the
god
oedipus
is
this
a
plot
of
creon
or
thine
own
teiresias
not
creon
thou
thyself
art
thine
own
bane
oedipus
o
wealth
and
empiry
and
skill
by
skill
outwitted
in
the
battlefield
of
life
what
spite
and
envy
follow
in
your
train
see
for
this
crown
the
state
conferred
on
me
a
gift
a
thing
i
sought
not
for
this
crown
the
trusty
creon
my
familiar
friend
hath
lain
in
wait
to
oust
me
and
suborned
this
mountebank
this
juggling
charlatan
this
tricksy
for
gain
alone
but
in
his
proper
art
say
sirrah
hast
thou
ever
proved
thyself
a
prophet
when
the
riddling
sphinx
was
here
why
hadst
thou
no
deliverance
for
this
folk
and
yet
the
riddle
was
not
to
be
solved
by
but
required
the
prophet
art
wherein
thou
wast
found
lacking
neither
birds
nor
sign
from
heaven
helped
thee
but
came
the
simple
oedipus
stopped
her
mouth
by
mother
wit
untaught
of
auguries
this
is
the
man
whom
thou
wouldst
undermine
in
hope
to
reign
with
creon
in
my
stead
methinks
that
thou
and
thine
abettor
soon
will
rue
your
plot
to
drive
the
scapegoat
out
thank
thy
grey
hairs
that
thou
hast
still
to
learn
what
chastisement
such
arrogance
deserves
chorus
to
us
it
seems
that
both
the
seer
and
thou
o
oedipus
have
spoken
angry
words
this
is
no
time
to
wrangle
but
consult
how
best
we
may
fulfill
the
oracle
teiresias
king
as
thou
art
free
speech
at
least
is
mine
to
make
reply
in
this
i
am
thy
peer
i
own
no
lord
but
loxias
him
i
serve
and
can
stand
enrolled
as
creon

thus
then
i
answer
since
thou
hast
not
spared
to
twit
me
with
my
blindness
thou
hast

misery
thou
art

thou
it

a

foe
to
thine

the
living

the
dead
aye
and
the
dogging
curse
of
mother
and

one
day
shall
drive
thee
like
a
sword
beyond
our
borders
and
the
eyes
that
now
see
clear
shall
henceforward
endless
night
ah
whither
shall
thy
bitter
cry
not
reach
what
crag
in
all
cithaeron
but
shall
then
reverberate
thy
wail
when
thou
hast
found
with
what
a
hymeneal
thou
wast
borne
home
but
to
no
fair
haven
on
the
gale
aye
and
a
flood
of
ills
thou
guessest
not

set
thyself
and

both
creon

day

be
thy
and
thy
grave
oedipus

by

voice
i
am
denounced
false
to

false
by
you
my

this

it

may
be
was
blurted
out
in
petulance
not
spoken

did
any
dare

that
it
was
i

such

were
said
with
what
intent
i

were
not
his

fixed

oedipus
sirrah
what
thou
here
dost
thou
presume
to
approach
my
doors
thou
rogue
my
murderer
and
the
filcher
of
my
crown
come
answer
this
didst
thou
detect
in
me
some
touch
of
cowardice
or
witlessness
that
made
thee
undertake
this
enterprise
i
seemed
forsooth
too
simple
to
perceive
the
serpent
stealing
on
me
in
the
dark
or
else
too
weak
to
scotch
it
when
i
saw
this
art
witless
seeking
to
possess
without
a
following
or
friends
the
crown
a
prize
that
followers
and
wealth
must
win
creon
attend
me
thou
hast
spoken
is
my
turn
to
make
reply
then
having
heard
me
judge
oedipus
thou
art
glib
of
tongue
but
i
am
slow
to
learn
of
thee
i
know
too
well
thy
venomous
hate
creon
first
i
would
argue
out
this
very
point
oedipus
o
argue
not
that
thou
art
not
a
rogue
creon
if
thou
dost
count
a
virtue
stubbornness
unschooled
by
reason
thou
art
much
astray
oedipus
if
thou
dost
hold
a
kinsman
may
be
wronged
and
no
pains
follow
thou
art
much
to
seek
creon
therein
thou
judgest
rightly
but
this
wrong
that
thou
allegest
tell
me
what
it
is
oedipus
didst
thou
or
didst
thou
not
advise
that
i
should
call
the
priest
creon
yes
and
i
stand
to
it
oedipus
tell
me
how
long
is
it
since
laius
creon
since
laius
i
follow
not
thy
drift
oedipus
by
violent
hands
was
spirited
away
creon
in
the
dim
past
a
many
years
agone
oedipus
did
the
same
prophet
then
pursue
his
craft
creon
yes
skilled
as
now
and
in
no
less
repute
oedipus
did
he
at
that
time
ever
glance
at
me
creon
not
to
my
knowledge
not
when
i
was
by
oedipus
but
was
no
search
and
inquisition
made
creon
surely
full
quest
was
made
but
nothing
learnt
oedipus
why
failed
the
seer
to
tell
his
story
creon
i
know
not
and
not
knowing
hold
my
tongue
oedipus
this
much
thou
knowest
and
canst
surely
tell
creon
what
thou
all
i
know
i
will
declare
oedipus
but
for
thy
prompting
never
had
the
seer
ascribed
to
me
the
death
of
laius
creon
if
so
he
thou
knowest
best
but
i
would
put
thee
to
the
question
in
my
turn
oedipus
question
and
prove
me
murderer
if
thou
canst
creon
then
let
me
ask
thee
didst
thou
wed
my
sister
oedipus
a
fact
so
plain
i
can
not
well
deny
creon
and
as
thy
consort
queen
she
shares
the
throne
oedipus
i
grant
her
freely
all
her
heart
desires
creon
and
with
you
twain
i
share
the
triple
rule
oedipus
yea
and
it
is
that
proves
thee
a
false
friend
creon
not
so
if
thou
wouldst
reason
with
thyself
as
i
with
myself
first
i
bid
thee
think
would
any
mortal
choose
a
troubled
reign
of
terrors
rather
than
secure
repose
if
the
same
power
were
given
him
as
for
me
i
have
no
natural
craving
for
the
name
of
king
preferring
to
do
kingly
deeds
and
so
thinks
every
man
now
all
my
needs
are
satisfied
through
thee
and
i
have
naught
to
fear
but
were
i
king
my
acts
would
oft
run
counter
to
my
will
how
could
a
title
then
have
charms
for
me
above
the
sweets
of
boundless
influence
i
am
not
so
infatuate
as
to
grasp
the
shadow
when
i
hold
the
substance
fast
now
all
men
cry
me
godspeed
wish
me
well
and
every
suitor
seeks
to
gain
my
ear
if
he
would
hope
to
win
a
grace
from
thee
why
should
i
leave
the
better
choose
the
worse
that
were
sheer
madness
and
i
am
not
mad
no
such
ambition
ever
tempted
me
nor
would
i
have
a
share
in
such
intrigue
and
if
thou
doubt
me
first
to
delphi
go
there
ascertain
if
my
report
was
true
of
the
god
answer
next
investigate
if
with
the
seer
i
plotted
or
conspired
and
if
it
prove
so
sentence
me
to
death
not
by
thy
voice
alone
but
mine
and
thine
but

what
provoked

quarrel
make
this
clear

points
me
out
as
laius
murderer

of
his
own
knowledge

upon
report
oedipus
he
is
too
cunning
to
commit
himself

makes
a
mouthpiece
of
a
knavish
seer

then
thou
mayest
ease
thy
conscience
on
that
score

and
i
convince
thee
that
no
man
hath
scot
or
lot
in
the
prophetic
art
here
is
the
proof
in
brief
an
oracle
once
came
to
laius
i
will
not
say
from
the
delphic
god
himself
but
from
his
ministers
declaring
he
was
doomed
to
perish
by
the
hand
of
his
own
son
a
child
that
should
be
born
to
him
by
me
now
laius
so
at
least
report
affirmed
was
murdered
on
a
day
by
highwaymen
no
natives
at
a
spot
where
three
roads
meet
as
for
the
child
it
was
but
three
days
old
when
laius
its
ankles
pierced
and
pinned
together
gave
it
to
be
cast
away
by
others
on
the
trackless
mountain
side
so
then
apollo
brought
it
not
to
pass
the
child
should
be
his
father
murderer
or
the
dread
terror
find
accomplishment
and
laius
be
slain
by
his
own
son
such
was
the
prophet
horoscope
o
king
regard
it
not
the
god
deems
fit
to
search
himself
unaided
will
reveal
oedipus
what
memories
what
wild
tumult
of
the
soul
came
me
lady
as
i
heard
thee
speak
jocasta
what
thou
what
has
shocked
and
startled
thee
oedipus
methought
i
heard
thee
say
that
laius
was
murdered
at
the
meeting
of
three
roads
jocasta
so
ran
the
story
that
is
current
still
oedipus
where
did
this
happen
dost
thou
know
the
place
jocasta
phocis
the
land
is
called
the
spot
is
where
branch
roads
from
delphi
and
from
daulis
meet
oedipus
and
how
long
is
it
since
these
things
befell
jocasta
but
a
brief
while
were
thou
wast
proclaimed
our
country
ruler
that
the
news
was
brought
oedipus
o
zeus
what
hast
thou
willed
to
do
with
me
jocasta
what
is
it
oedipus
that
moves
thee
so
oedipus
ask
me
not
yet
tell
me
the
build
and
height
of
laius
was
he
still
in
manhood
prime
jocasta
tall
was
he
and
his
hair
was
lightly
strewn
with
silver
and
not
unlike
thee
in
form
oedipus
o
woe
is
me
mehtinks
unwittingly
i
laid
but
now
a
dread
curse
on
myself
jocasta
what
thou
when
i
look
upon
thee
my
king
i
tremble
oedipus
is
a
dread
presentiment
that
in
the
end
the
seer
will
prove
not
blind
one
further
question
to
resolve
my
doubt
jocasta
i
quail
but
ask
and
i
will
answer
all
oedipus
had
he
but
few
attendants
or
a
train
of
armed
retainers
with
him
like
a
prince
jocasta
they
were
but
five
in
all
and
one
of
them
a
herald
laius
in
a
rode
oedipus
alas
is
clear
as
noonday
now
but
say
lady
who
carried
this
report
to
thebes
jocasta
a
serf
the
sole
survivor
who
returned
oedipus
haply
he
is
at
hand
or
in
the
house
jocasta
no
for
as
soon
as
he
returned
and
found
thee
reigning
in
the
stead
of
laius
slain
he
clasped
my
hand
and
supplicated
me
to
send
him
to
the
alps
and
pastures
where
he
might
be
farthest
from
the
sight
of
thebes
and
so
i
sent
him
was
an
honest
slave
and
well
deserved
some
better
recompense
oedipus
fetch
him
at
once
i
fain
would
see
the
man
jocasta
he
shall
be
brought
but
wherefore
summon
him
oedipus
lady
i
fear
my
tongue
has
overrun
discretion
therefore
i
would
question
him
jocasta
well
he
shall
come
but
may
not
i
too
claim
to
share
the
burden
of
thy
heart
my
king
oedipus
and
thou
shalt
not
be
frustrate
of
thy
wish
now
my
imaginings
have
gone
so
far
who
has
a
higher
claim
that
thou
to
hear
my
tale
of
dire
adventures
listen
then
my
sire
was
polybus
of
corinth
and
my
mother
merope
a
dorian
and
i
was
held
the
foremost
citizen
till
a
strange
thing
befell
me
strange
indeed
yet
scarce
deserving
all
the
heat
it
stirred
a
roisterer
at
some
banquet
flown
with
wine
shouted
thou
art
not
true
son
of
thy
sire
it
irked
me
but
i
stomached
for
the
nonce
the
insult
on
the
morrow
i
sought
out
my
mother
and
my
sire
and
questioned
them
they
were
indignant
at
the
random
slur
cast
on
my
parentage
and
did
their
best
to
comfort
me
but
still
the
venomed
barb
rankled
for
still
the
scandal
spread
and
grew
so
privily
without
their
leave
i
went
to
delphi
and
apollo
sent
me
back
baulked
of
the
knowledge
that
i
came
to
seek
but
other
grievous
things
he
prophesied
woes
lamentations
mourning
portents
dire
to
wit
i
should
defile
my
mother
bed
and
raise
up
seed
too
loathsome
to
behold
and
slay
the
father
from
whose
loins
i
sprang
then
lady
thou
shalt
hear
the
very
truth
as
i
drew
near
the
roads
a
herald
met
me
and
a
man
who
sat
in
a
car
drawn
by
colts
as
in
thy
tale
the
man
in
front
and
the
old
man
himself
threatened
to
thrust
me
rudely
from
the
path
then
jostled
by
the
charioteer
in
wrath
i
struck
him
and
the
old
man
seeing
this
watched
till
i
passed
and
from
his
car
brought
down
full
on
my
head
the
goad
yet
was
i
quits
with
him
and
more
one
stroke
of
my
good
staff
sufficed
to
fling
him
clean
out
of
the
chariot
seat
and
laid
him
prone
and
so
i
slew
them
every
one
but
if
betwixt
this
stranger
there
was
aught
in
common
with
laius
who
more
miserable
than
i
what
mortal
could
you
find
more
wretch
whom
no
sojourner
no
citizen
may
harbor
or
address
whom
all
are
bound
to
harry
from
their
homes
and
this
same
curse
was
laid
on
me
and
laid
by
none
but
me
yea
with
these
hands
all
gory
i
pollute
the
bed
of
him
i
slew
say
am
i
vile
am
i
not
utterly
unclean
a
wretch
doomed
to
be
banished
and
in
banishment
forgo
the
sight
of
all
my
dearest
ones
and
never
tread
again
my
native
earth
or
else
to
wed
my
mother
and
slay
my
sire
polybus
who
begat
me
and
upreared
if
one
should
say
this
is
the
handiwork
of
some
inhuman
power
who
could
blame
his
judgment
but
ye
pure
and
awful
gods
forbid
forbid
that
i
should
see
that
day
may
i
be
blotted
out
from
living
men
ere
such
a
plague
spot
set
on
me
its
brand
chorus
we
too
o
king
are
troubled
but
till
thou
hast
questioned
the
survivor
still
hope
on
oedipus
my
hope
is
faint
but
still
enough
survives
to
bid
me
bide
the
coming
of
this
herd
jocasta
suppose
him
here
what
wouldst
thou
learn
of
him
oedipus
i
tell
thee
lady
if
his
tale
agrees
with
thine
i
shall
have
calamity
jocasta
and
what
of
special
import
did
i
say
oedipus
in
thy
report
of
what
the
herdsman
said
laius
was
slain
by
robbers
now
if
he
still
speaks
of
robbers
not
a
robber
i
slew
him
not
one
with
many
can
not
square
but
if
he
says
one
lonely
wayfarer
the
last
link
wanting
to
my
guilt
is
forged
jocasta
well
rest
assured
his
tale
ran
thus
at
first
nor
can
he
now
retract
what
then
he
said
not
i
alone
but
all
our
townsfolk
heard
it
should
he
vary
somewhat
in
his
story

can
not
make
the
death
of
laius
in
any
wise
jump
with
the
oracle
for
loxias
said
expressly
he
was
doomed
to
die
by
my
child

shed
no

destroy
the
parricide
the
scoundrel

i

in

plight
better
to
consult
the

anew
oedipus
dare
ye
inquire
concerning
such
a
wretch
creon
yea
for

wouldst
credit
now
his

on
thee
in

i
lay

her
who
lies
within
receive
such
burial
as
thou
shalt
ordain
such

is
thine
as

of
my

on
the
hills
on
yonder
mount
cithaeron
famed
as
mine
my
tomb
predestined
for
me
by
my

they
lived

die
slain
as
they
sought

slay
me
when
alive
this
much
i

full
surely
nor

such
disrepute

must
cling

himself

i
should
invoke
stranger
the
gracious
ones
so
our
folk
call
them
but
elsewhere
other
names
are
rife
oedipus
then
may
they
show
their
suppliant
grace
for
i
from
this
your
sanctuary
will
depart

word
is
this
oedipus
the
watchword
of
my
fate

the
spot
to
fame
unknown
but
dear
to
us
its
native
worshipers
oedipus
thou
sayest
there
are
dwellers
in
these
parts
stranger

they
bear
the
name

yonder
god

by
a
king

by
the
general
voice

of

and
trouble
father
that
i
bore
to
find
thy

how
thou
faredst
i
spare
thee
surely
a
double
pain
to
suffer
first
in
act
and
then
in
telling
the
misfortune
of
thine
sons
i
come
to
tell
thee
at
the
first
they
willed
to
leave
the
throne
to
creon
minded
well
thus
to
remove
the
inveterate
curse
of
old
a
canker
that
infected
all
thy
race
but
now
some
god
and
an
infatuate
soul
have
stirred
betwixt
them
a
mad
rivalry
to
grasp
at
sovereignty
and
kingly
power
today
the
youth
the
younger
born
is
keeping
polyneices
from
the
throne
his
elder
and
has
thrust
him
from
the
land
the
banished
brother
so
all
thebes
reports
fled
to
the
vale
of
argos
and
by
help
of
new
alliance
there
and
friends
in
arms
swears
he
will
stablish
argos
straight
as
lord
of
the
cadmeian
land
or
if
he
fail
exalt
the
victor
to
the
stars
of
heaven
this
is
no
empty
tale
but
deadly
truth
my
father
and
how
long
thy
agony
ere
the
gods
pity
thee
i
can
not
tell
oedipus
hast
thou
indeed
then
entertained
a
hope
the
gods
at
last
will
turn
and
rescue
me
ismene
yea
so
i
read
these
latest
oracles
oedipus
what
oracles
what
hath
been
uttered
child
ismene
thy
country
so
it
runs
shall
yearn
in
time
to
have
thee
for
their
weal
alive
or
dead
oedipus
and
who
could
gain
by
such
a
one
as
i
ismene
on
thee
is
said
their
sovereignty
depends
oedipus
so
when
i
cease
to

begins
ismene
the
gods
who
once
abased
uplift
thee
now
oedipus
poor
help
to
raise
an
old
man
fallen
in
youth
ismene
that
be
is
for
this
cause
alone
that
creon
comes
to
thee
and
comes
anon
oedipus
with
what
intent
my
daughter
tell
me
plainly
ismene
to
plant
thee
near
the
theban
land
and
so
keep
thee
within
their
grasp
yet
now
allow
thy
foot
to
pass
beyond
their
boundaries
oedipus
what
gain
they
if
i
lay
outside
oedipus
thy
tomb
if
disappointed
brings
on
them
a
curse
oedipus
it
needs
no
god
to
tell
what
plain
to
sense
ismene
therefore
they
fain
would
have
thee
close
at
hand
not
where
thou
wouldst
be
master
of
thyself
oedipus
mean
they
to
shroud
my
bones
in
theban
dust
ismene
nay
father
guilt
of
kinsman
blood
forbids
oedipus
then
never
shall
they
be
my
masters
never
ismene

thou
shalt
rue
this
bitterly
some
day
oedipus
when
what
conjunction
comes
to
pass
my
child
ismene
thy
angry
wraith
when
at
thy
tomb
they
stand
oedipus
and
who
hath
told
thee
what
thou
me
child
ismene
envoys
who
visited
the
delphic
hearth
oedipus
hath
phoebus
spoken
thus
concerning
me
ismene
so
say
the
envoys
who
returned
to
thebes
oedipus
and
can
a
son
of
mine
have
heard
of
this
ismene
yea
both
alike
and
know
its
import
well
oedipus
they
knew
it
yet
the
ignoble
greed
of
rule
outweighed
all
longing
for
their
sire
return
ismene
grievous
thy
words
yet
i
must
own
them
true
oedipus
then
may
the
gods
quench
their
fatal
feud
and
mine
be
the
arbitrament
of
the
fight
for
which
they
now
are
arming
spear
to
spear
that
neither
he
who
holds
the
scepter
now
may
keep
this
throne
nor
he
who
fled
the
realm
return
again
never
raised
a

their

was
thrust
from

my

ye
take
alarm

approach
i
read
it
in
your

fear
nothing

refrain
from
angry
words
i
come
with
no
ill
purpose
i
am
old
and
know
the
city
whither
i
am
come
without
a
peer
amongst
the
powers
of
greece
it
was
by
reason
of
my
years
that
i
was
chosen
to
persuade
your
guest
and
bring
him
back
to
thebes
not
the
delegate
of
one
man
but
commissioned
by
the
state
since
of
all
thebans
i
have
most
bewailed
being
his
kinsman
his
most
grievous
woes
o
listen
to
me
luckless
oedipus
come
home
the
whole
cadmeian
people
claim
with
right
to
have
thee
back
i
most
of
all
for
most
of
all
else
were
i
vile
indeed
i
mourn
for
thy
misfortunes
seeing
thee
an
aged
outcast
wandering
on
and
on
a
beggar
with
one
handmaid
for
thy
stay
ah
who
had
imagined
she
could
fall
to
such
a
depth
of
misery
as
this
to
tend
in
penury
thy
stricken
frame
a
virgin
ripe
for
wedlock
but
unwed
a
prey
for
any
wanton
ravisher
seems
it
not
cruel
this
reproach
i
cast
on
thee
and
on
myself
and
all
the
race
aye
but
an
open
shame
can
not
be
hid
hide
it
o
hide
it
oedipus
thou
canst
o
by
our
fathers
gods
consent
i
pray
come
back

come
to
thy

home
bid
athens
as
is
meet
a
fond
farewell
thebes
thy
old
claims
thee
first
oedipus
o
front
of
brass
thy
subtle
tongue
would
twist
to
thy
advantage
every
plea
of
right
why
try
thy
arts
on
me
why
spread
again
toils
where
gall
me
sorest
to
be
snared
in
old
days
when
by
woes
distraught
i
yearned
for
exile
as
a
glad
release
thy
will
refused
the
favor
then
i
craved
but
when
my
frenzied
grief
had
spent
its
force
and
i
was
fain
to
taste
the
sweets
of
home
then
thou
wouldst
thrust
me
from
my
country
then
these
ties
of
kindred
were
by
thee
ignored
and
now
again
when
thou
this
state
and
all
its
kindly
people
welcome
me
thou
to
part
us
wrapping
in
soft
words
hard
thoughts
and
yet
what
pleasure
canst
thou
find
in
forcing
friendship
on
unwilling
foes
suppose
a
man
refused
to
grant
some
boon
when
you
importuned
him
and
afterwards
when
you
had
got
your
heart
desire
consented
granting
a
grace
from
which
all
grace
had
fled
would
not
such
favor
seem
an
empty
boon
yet
such
the
boon
thou
profferest
now
to
me
fair
in
appearance
but
when
tested
false
yea
i
will
proved
thee
false
that
these
may
hear
thou
art
come
to
take
me
not
to
take
me
home
but
plant
me
on
thy
borders
that
thy
state
may
so
escape
annoyance
from
this
land
thou
shalt
never
gain
but
instead
my
ghost
to
haunt
thy
country
without
end
and
for
my
sons
this
heritage
no
more
just
room
to
die
in

the

slip
away

i
become
a
mockery
to
this
my

despoiled
by

quick

i

this
stranger
had
i
let
my
rage
justly
provoked
have

he
had
not
scathless
and
uncorrected
at
my
hands
but
now
the
laws
to
which
himself
appealed
these
and
none
others
shall
adjudicate
thou
shalt
not
quit
this
land
till
thou
hast
fetched
the
maidens
and
produced
them
in
my
sight
thou
hast
offended
both
against
myself
and
thine
own
race
and
country
having
come
unto
a
state
that
champions
right
and
asks
for
every
action
warranty
of
law
thou
hast
set
aside
the
custom
of
the
land
and
like
some
freebooter
art
carrying
off
what
plunder
pleases
thee
as
if
forsooth
thou
thoughtest
this
a
city
without
men
or
manned
by
slaves
and
me
a
thing
of
naught
yet
not
from
thebes
this
villainy
was
learnt
thebes
is
not
wont
to
breed
unrighteous
sons
nor
would
she
praise
thee
if
she
learnt
that
thou
wert
robbing
me
aye
and
the
gods
to
boot
haling
by
force
their
suppliants
poor
maids
were
i
on
theban
soil
to
prosecute
the
justest
claim
imaginable
i
would
never
wrest
by
violence
my
own
without
sanction
of
your
state
or
king
i
should
behave
as
fits
an
outlander
living
amongst
a
foreign
folk
but
thou
shamest
a
city
that
deserves
it
not
even
thine
own
and
plentitude
of
years
have
made
of
thee
an
old
man
and
a
fool
therefore
again
i
charge
thee
as
before
see
that
the
maidens
are
restored
at
once
unless
thou
continue
here
by
force
and
not
by
choice
a
sojourner
so
much
i
tell
thee
home
and
what
i
say
i
mean
chorus
thy
case
is
perilous
though
by
birth
and
race
thou
be
just
thou
plainly
doest
wrong
creon
not
deeming
this
city
void
of
men
or
counsel
son
of
aegeus
as
thou
i
did
what
i
have
done
rather
i
thought
your
people
were
not
like
to
set
such
store
by
kin
of
mine
and
keep
them
my
will
nor
would
they
harbor
so
i
stood
assured
a
godless
parricide
a
reprobate
convicted
of
incestuous
marriage
ties
for
on
her
native
hill
of
ares
here
i
knew
your
areopagus
sits
justice
and
permits
not
vagrant
folk
to
stay
within
your
borders
in
that
faith
i
hunted
down
my
quarry
and
then
i
had
refrained
but
for
the
curses
dire
wherewith
he
banned
my
kinsfolk
and
myself
such
wrong
methought
had
warrant
for
my
act
anger
has
no
old
age
but
only
death
the
dead
alone
can
feel
no
touch
of
spite
so
thou
must
work
thy
will
my
cause
is
just
but
weak
without
allies
yet
will
i
try
old
as
i
am
to
answer
deeds
with
deeds
oedipus
o
shameless
railer
thou
this
abuse
defames
my
grey
hairs
rather
than
thine
own
murder
and
incest
deeds
of
horror
all
thou
blurtest
forth
against
me
all
i
have
borne
no
willing
sinner
so
it
pleased
the
gods
wrath
haply
with
my
sinful
race
of
old
since
thou
find
no
sin
in
me
myself
for
which
in
retribution
i
was
doomed
to
trespass
thus
against
myself
and
mine
answer
me
now
if
by
some
oracle
my
sire
was
destined
to
a
bloody
end
by
a
son
hand
can
this
reflect
on
me
me
then
unborn
begotten
by
no
sire
conceived
in
no
mother
womb
and
if
when
born
to
misery
as
born
i
was
i
met
my
sire
not
knowing
whom
i
met
or
what
i
did
and
slew
him
how
canst
thou
with
justice
blame
the
hand
and
for
my
mother
wretch
art
not
ashamed
seeing
she
was
thy
sister
to
extort
from
me
the
story
of
her
marriage
such
a
marriage
as
i
straightway
will
proclaim
for
i
will
speak
thy
lewd
and
impious
speech
has
broken
all
the
bonds
of
reticence
she
was
ah
woe
is
me
she
was
my
mother
i
knew
it
not
nor
she
and
she
my
mother
bare
children
to
the
son
whom
she
had
borne
a
birth
of
shame
but
this
at
least
i
know
wittingly
thou
aspersest
her
and
me
but
i
unwitting
wed
unwilling
speak
nay
neither
in
this
marriage
or
this
deed
which
thou
art
ever
casting
in
my
teeth
a
murdered
sire
shall
i
be
held
to
blame
come
answer
me
one
question
if
thou
canst
if
one
should
presently
attempt
thy
life
thou
o
man
of
justice
first
inquire
if
the
assassin
was
perchance
thy
sire
or
turn
upon
him
as
thou
thy
life
on
thy
aggressor
thou
turn
no
stay
debating
if
the
law
would
bear
thee
out
such
was
my
case
and
such
the
pass
whereto
the
gods
reduced
me
and
methinks
my
sire
could
he
come
back
to
life
would
not
dissent
yet
thou
for
just
thou
art
not
but
a
man
who
sticks
at
nothing
if
it
serve
his
plea
reproachest
me
with
this
before
these
men
it
serves
thy
turn
to
laud
great
theseus
name
and
athens
as
a
wisely
governed
state
yet
in
thy
flatteries
one
thing
is
to
seek
if
any
land
knows
how
to
pay
the
gods
their
proper
rites
is
athens
most
of
all
this
is
the
land
whence
thou
wast
fain

thou

we

both
oedipus
my

so

sorrow

i
have
my

if

should
come
death
were
not
wholly
bitter
with
you

cling

press
me
close
on
either
side
there
rest
ye
from
your
dreary
wayfaring
now
tell
me
of
your
ventures
but
in
brief
brief
speech
suffices
for
young
maids
like
you
antigone
here
is
our
savior
thou
hear
the
tale
from
his
own
lips
so
shall
my
part
be
brief
oedipus
i
pray
thee
do
not
wonder
if
the
sight
of
children
given
for
lost
has
made
my
converse
somewhat
long
and
tedious
full
well
i
know
the
joy
i
have
of
them
is
due
to
thee
to
thee
and
no
man
else
thou
wast
their
sole
deliverer
none
else
the
gods
deal
with
thee
after
my
desire
with
thee
and
with
this
land
for
fear
of
heaven
i
found
above
all
peoples
most
with
you
and
righteousness
and
lips
that
can
not
lie
i
speak
in
gratitude
of
what
i
know
for
all
i
have
i
owe
to
thee
alone
give
me
thy
hand
o
prince
that
i
may
touch
it
and
if
thou
wilt
permit
me
kiss
thy
cheek
what
say
i
can
i
wish
that
thou
touch
one
fallen
like
me
to
utter
wretchedness
corrupt
and
tainted
with
a
thousand
ills
oh
no
i
would
not
let
thee
if
thou
they
only
who
have
known
calamity
can
share
it
let
me
greet
thee
where
thou
art
and
still
befriend
me
as
thou
hast
till
now
theseus
i
marvel
not
if
thou
hast
dallied
long
in
converse
with
thy
children
and
preferred
their
speech
to
mine
i
feel
no
jealousy
i
would
be
famous
more
by
deeds
than
words
of
this
old
friend
thou
hast
had
proof
my
oath
i
have
fulfilled
and
brought
thee
back
the
maids
alive
and
nothing
harmed
for
all
those
threats
and
how
the
fight
was
won
waste
of
words
to
boast
thy
daughters
here
will
tell
thee
all
but
of
a
matter
that
has
lately
chanced
on
my
way
hitherward
i
fain
would
have
thy
counsel
slight
seem
yet
worthy
thought
a
wise
man
heeds
all
matters
great
or
small
oedipus
what
is
it
son
of
aegeus
let
me
hear
of
what
thou
askest
i
myself
know
naught
theseus
said
a
man
no
countryman
of
thine
but
of
thy
kin
hath
taken
sanctuary
beside
the
altar
of
poseidon
where
i
was
at
sacrifice
when
called
away
oedipus
what
is
his
country
what
the
suitor
prayer
theseus
i
know
but
one
thing
he
implores
i
am
told
a
word
with
thee
he
will
not
trouble
thee
oedipus
what
seeks
he
if
a
suppliant
something
grave
theseus
he
only
waits
they
say
to
speak
with
thee
and
then
unharmed
to
go
upon
his
way
oedipus
i
marvel
who
is
this
petitioner
theseus
think
if
there
be
not
any
of
thy
kin
at
argos
who
might
claim
this
boon
of
thee
oedipus
dear
friend
forbear
i
pray
theseus
what
ails
thee
now
oedipus
ask
it
not
of
me
theseus
ask
not
what
explain
oedipus
thy
words
have
told
me
who
the
suppliant
is
theseus
who
can
he
be
that
i
should
frown
on
him
oedipus
my
son
o
king
my
hateful
son
whose
words
of
all
men
most
would
jar
upon
my
ears
theseus
thou
sure
mightest
listen
if
his
suit
offend
no
need
to
grant
it
why
so
loth
to
hear
him
oedipus
that
voice
o
king
grates
on
a
father
ears
i
have
come
to
loathe
it
force
me
not
to
yield
theseus
but
he
hath
found
asylum
o
beware
and
fail
not
in
due
reverence
to
the
god
antigone
o
heed
me
father
though
i
am
young
in
years
let
the
prince
have
his
will
and
pay
withal
what
in
his
eyes
is
service
to
the
god
for
our
sake
also
let
our
brother
come
if
what
he
urges
tend
not
to
thy
good
he
can
not
surely
wrest
perforce
thy
will
to
hear
him
then
what
harm
by
open
words
a
scheme
of
villainy
is
soon
bewrayed
thou
art
his
father
therefore
canst
not
pay
in

impious

ousted
me
not

by

the

by

thy
question
hits
the
marvel
of
the
tale
how
he
moved
hence
you
saw
him
and
must
know
without
a
friend
to
lead
the
way
himself
guiding
us
all
so
having
reached
the
abrupt
threshold
with
its
brazen
stairs
he
paused
at
one
of
the
converging
paths
hard
by
the
rocky
basin
which
records
the
pact
of
theseus
and
peirithous
betwixt
that
rift
and
the
thorician
rock
the
hollow
and
the
marble
tomb
midway
he
sat
and
loosed
his
beggar
weeds
then
calling
to
his
daughters
bade
them
fetch
of
running
water
both
to
wash
withal
and
make
libation
so
they
clomb
the
steep
and
in
brief
space
brought
what
their
father
bade
then
laved
and
dressed
him
with
observance
due
but
when
he
had
his
will
in
everything
and
no
desire
was
left
unsatisfied
it
thundered
from
the
netherworld
the
maids
shivered
and
crouching
at
their
father
knees
wept
beat
their
breast
and
uttered
a
long
wail
he
as
he
heard
their
sudden
bitter
cry
folded
his
arms
about
them
both
and
said
my
children
ye
will
lose
your
sire
today
for
all
of
me
has
perished
and
no
more
have
ye
to
bear
your
long
long
ministry
a
heavy
load
i
know
and
yet
one
word
wipes
out
all
score
of
tribulations
and
love
from
me
ye
had
from
no
man
more
but
now
must
live
without
me
all
your
days
so
clinging
to
each
other
sobbed
and
wept
father
and
daughters
both
but
when
at
last
their
mourning
had
an
end
and
no
wail
rose
a
moment
there
was
silence
suddenly
a
voice
that
summoned
him
with
sudden
dread
the
hair
of
all
stood
up
and
all
were
for
the
call
came
now
loud
now
low
and
oft
oedipus
oedipus
why
tarry
we
too
long
too
long
thy
passing
is
delayed
but
when
he
heard
the
summons
of
the
god
he
prayed
that
theseus
might
be
brought
and
when
the
prince
came
nearer
o
my
friend
he
cried
pledge
ye
my
daughters
giving
thy
right
hand
and
daughters
give
him
yours
and
promise
me
thou
never
wilt
forsake
them
but
do
all
that
time
and
friendship
prompt
in
their
behoof
and
he
of
his
nobility
repressed
his
tears
and
swore
to
be
their
constant
friend
this
promise
given
oedipus
put
forth
blind
hands
and
laid
them
on
his
children
saying
o
children
prove
your
true
nobility
and
hence
depart
nor
seek
to
witness
sights
unlawful
or
to
hear
unlawful
words
nay
go
with
speed
let
none
but
theseus
stay
our
ruler
to
behold
what
next
shall
hap

we
all
heard
him
speak
and
weeping
sore
we
companied
the
maidens
on
their
way
after
brief
space
we
looked
again
and
lo
the
man
was
gone
evanished
from
our
eyes

the
king

saw
with
upraised
hand
shading
his
eyes

from
some
awful
sight
that
no
man
might
endure
to
look
upon
a
moment
later
and
we
saw
him
bend
in
prayer
to
earth
and
prayer
to
heaven
at
once
but
by
what
doom
the
stranger
met
his
end
no
man
save
theseus
knoweth
for
there
fell
no
fiery
bold
that
reft
him
in
that
hour

from

he
was
taken

without

by

the

again
our

now
safe
in
port
but
you
by
special
summons
i
convened
as
my
most
trusted
councilors
first
because
i
knew
you
loyal
to
laius
of
old
again
when
oedipus
restored
our
state
both
while
he
ruled
and
when
his
rule
was
ye
still
were
constant
to
the
royal
line
now
that
his
two
sons
perished
in
one
day
brother
by
brother
murderously
slain
by
right
of
kinship
to
the
princes
dead
i
claim
and
hold
the
throne
and
sovereignty
yet
is
no
easy
matter
to
discern
the
temper
of
a
man
his
mind
and
will
till
he
be
proved
by
exercise
of
power
and
in
my
case
if
one
who
reigns
supreme
swerve
from
the
highest
policy
by
fear
of
consequence
that
man
i
hold
and
ever
held
the
basest
of
the
base
and
i
contemn
the
man
who
sets
his
friend
before
his
country
for
myself
i
call
to
witness
zeus
whose
eyes
are
everywhere
if
i
perceive
some
mischievous
design
to
sap
the
state
i
will
not
hold
my
tongue
nor
would
i
reckon
as
my
private
friend
a
public
foe
well
knowing
that
the
state
is
the
good
ship
that
holds
our
fortunes
all
farewell
to
friendship
if
she
suffers
wreck
such
is
the
policy
by
which
i
seek
to
serve
the
commons
and
conformably
i
have
proclaimed
an
edict
as
concerns
the
sons
of
oedipus
eteocles
who
in
his
country
battle
fought
and
fell
the
foremost

duly
bury
him

all
observances

ceremonies

are

for

miscreant
exile
who
returned
minded
in
flames

ashes
to
blot
out
his
father
city
and
his
father
gods
and
glut
his
vengeance
with

drag
them

ordained

none
shall
give
him

make
mourn
for
him

leave
his
corpse
unburied

ghastly

so
am
i
purposed
never

then
sirrah
shoot

get
thee
gone
guard
well
it
must
out
the
corpse
is
buried
someone
now
besprinkled
it
with
thirsty
dust
performed
the
proper
ritual
and
was
gone
creon
what
thou
who
hath
dared
to
do
this
thing
guard
i
can
not
tell
for
there
was
a
trace
of
pick
or
mattock
hard
unbroken
ground
without
a
scratch
or
rut
of
chariot
wheels
no
sign
that
human
hands
had
been
at
work
when
the
first
sentry
of
the
morning
watch
gave
the
alarm
we
all
were
the
corpse
had
vanished
not
interred
in
earth
but
strewn
with
dust
as
if
by
one
who
sought
to
avert
the
curse
that
haunts
the
unburied
dead
of
hound
or
ravening
jackal
not
a
sign
thereat
arose
an
angry
war
of
words
guard
railed
at
guard
and
blows
were
like
to
end
it
for
none
was
there
to
part
us
each
in
turn
suspected
but
the
guilt
brought
home
to
none
from
lack
of
evidence
we
challenged
each
the
ordeal
or
to
handle
iron
or
pass
through
fire
affirming
on
our
oath
our
innocence
we
neither
did
the
deed
ourselves
nor
know
who
did
or
compassed
it
our
quest
was
at
a
standstill
when
one
spake
and
bowed
us
all
to
earth
like
quivering
reeds
for
there
was
no
gainsaying
him
nor
way
to
escape
perdition
so
he
spake
and
he
convinced
us
all
so
lots
were
cast
and
i
unlucky
scapegoat
drew

it
happened
thus
no

had
we
come
driven
from

by
those
awful
threats
than
straight
we
swept
away
all
trace
of
dust
and
bared
the
clammy
body
then
we
sat
high
on
the
ridge
to
windward
of
the
stench
while
each
man
kept
he
fellow
alert
and
rated
roundly
the
sluggard
if
he
chanced
to
nap
so
all
night
long
we
watched
until
the
sun
stood
high
in
heaven
and
his
blazing
beams
smote
us
a
sudden
whirlwind
then
upraised
a
cloud
of
dust
that
blotted
out
the
sky
and
swept
the
plain
and
stripped
the
woodlands
bare
and
shook
the
firmament
we
closed
our
eyes
and
waited
till
the
plague
should
pass
at
last
it
ceased
and
lo
there
stood
this
maid
a
piercing
cry
she
uttered
sad
and
shrill
as
when
the
mother
bird
beholds
her
nest
robbed
of
its
nestlings
even
so
the
maid
wailed
as
she
saw
the
body
stripped
and
bare
and
cursed
the
ruffians
who
had
done
this
deed
anon
she
gathered
handfuls
of
dry
dust
then
holding
high
a
brazen
urn
thrice
on
the
dead
she
poured
a
lustral
stream
we
at
the
sight
swooped
down
on
her

seized
our
quarry
undismayed
she
stood
and
when
we
taxed
her
with
the
former
crime
and
this
she
disowned
nothing
i

glad
and
grieved
for

most
sweet
to
oneself

to
bring
disaster

thou

all
knew

should

creon

break

antigone

were
not
ordained

disobey
these

so
provoke
the
wrath
of
heaven

that
i
must
die

thou
not

it

if
death
is
thereby
hastened
i

count
it
gain

death
is
gain
to
him
whose
life
like
mine
is
full
of
misery

my
lot
appears

blissful

grieved
with
