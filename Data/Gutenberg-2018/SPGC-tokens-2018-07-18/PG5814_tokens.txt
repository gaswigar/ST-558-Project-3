suppose
we
applied
no
more
ingenuity
to
the
instruction
of
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
children
than
we
sometimes
apply
in
our
american
public
schools
to
the
instruction
of
children
who
are
in
possession
of
all
their
faculties
the
result
would
be
that
the
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
would
acquire
nothing
they
would
live
and
die
as
ignorant
as
bricks
and
stones
the
methods
used
in
the
asylums
are
rational
the
teacher
exactly
measures
the
child
capacity
to
begin
with
and
from
thence
onwards
the
tasks
imposed
are
nicely
gauged
to
the
gradual
development
of
that
capacity
the
tasks
keep
pace
with
the
steps
of
the
progress
they
do
jump
miles
and
leagues
ahead
of
it
by
irrational
caprice
and
land
in
vacancy
according
to
the
average
plan
in
the
public
school
apparently
they
teach
the
child
to
spell
cat
then
ask
it
to
calculate
an
eclipse
when
it
can
read
words
of
two
syllables
they
require
it
to
explain
the
circulation
of
the
blood
when
it
reaches
the
head
of
the
infant
class
they
bully
it
with
conundrums
that
cover
the
domain
of
universal
knowledge
this
sounds
extravagant
and
is
yet
it
goes
no
great
way
beyond
the
facts
i
received
a
curious
letter
one
day
from
the
punjab
you
must
pronounce
it
punjawb
the
handwriting
was
excellent
and
the
wording
was
english
english
and
yet
not
exactly
english
the
style
was
easy
and
smooth
and
flowing
yet
there
was
something
subtly
foreign
about
it
a
something
tropically
ornate
and
sentimental
and
rhetorical
it
turned
out
to
be
the
work
of
a
hindoo
youth
the
holder
of
a
humble
clerical
billet
in
a
railway
office
he
had
been
educated
in
one
of
the
numerous
colleges
of
india
upon
inquiry
i
was
told
that
the
country
was
full
of
young
fellows
of
his
like
they
had
been
educated
away
up
to
the
of
learning
and
the
market
for
all
this
elaborate
cultivation
was
minutely
out
of
proportion
to
the
vastness
of
the
product
this
market
consisted
of
some
thousands
of
small
clerical
posts
under
the
government
the
supply
of
material
for
it
was
multitudinous
if
this
youth
with
the
flowing
style
and
the
blossoming
english
was
occupying
a
small
railway
clerkship
it
meant
that
there
were
hundreds
and
hundreds
as
capable
as
he
or
he
would
be
in
a
high
place
and
it
certainly
meant
that
there
were
thousands
whose
education
and
capacity
had
fallen
a
little
short
and
that
they
would
have
to
go
without
places
apparently
then
the
colleges
of
india
were
doing
what
our
high
schools
have
long
been
doing
richly
the
market
for
service
and
thereby
doing
a
damage
to
the
scholar
and
through
him
to
the
country
at
home
i
once
made
a
speech
deploring
the
injuries
inflicted
by
the
high
school
in
making
handicrafts
distasteful
to
boys
who
would
have
been
willing
to
make
a
living
at
trades
and
agriculture
if
they
had
but
had
the
good
luck
to
stop
with
the
common
school
but
i
made
no
converts
not
one
in
a
community
overrun
with
educated
idlers
who
were
above
following
their
fathers
mechanical
trades
yet
could
find
no
market
for
their
the
same
rail
that
brought
me
the
letter
from
the
punjab
brought
also
a
little
book
published
by
thacker
spink
of
calcutta
which
interested
me
for
both
its
preface
and
its
contents
treated
of
this
matter
of
in
the
preface
occurs
this
paragraph
from
the
calcutta
review
for
government
office
read
drygoods
clerkship
and
it
will
fit
more
than
one
region
of
america
the
education
that
we
give
makes
the
boys
a
little
less
clownish
in
their
manners
and
more
intelligent
when
spoken
to
by
strangers
on
the
other
hand
it
has
made
them
less
contented
with
their
lot
in
life
and
less
willing
to
work
with
their
hands
the
form
which
discontent
takes
in
this
country
is
not
of
a
healthy
kind
for
the
natives
of
india
consider
that
the
only
occupation
worthy
of
an
educated
man
is
that
of
a
writership
in
some
office
and
especially
in
a
government
office
the
village
schoolboy
goes
back
to
the
plow
with
the
greatest
reluctance
and
the
town
schoolboy
carries
the
same
discontent
and
inefficiency
into
his
father
workshop
sometimes
these
positively
refuse
at
first
to
work
and
more
than
once
parents
have
openly
expressed
their
regret
that
they
ever
allowed
their
sons
to
be
inveigled
to
school
the
little
book
which
i
am
quoting
from
is
called
literature
and
is
well
stocked
with
baboo
english
clerkly
english
hooky
english
acquired
in
the
schools
some
of
it
is
very
funny
almost
as
funny
perhaps
as
what
you
and
i
produce
when
we
try
to
write
in
a
language
not
our
own
but
much
of
it
is
surprisingly
correct
and
free
if
i
were
going
to
quote
good
english
but
i
am
not
india
is
well
stocked
with
natives
who
speak
it
and
write
it
as
well
as
the
best
of
us
i
merely
wish
to
show
some
of
the
quaint
imperfect
attempts
at
the
use
of
our
tongue
there
are
many
letters
in
the
book
poverty
imploring
help
bread
money
kindness
office
generally
an
office
a
clerkship
some
way
to
get
food
and
a
rag
out
of
the
unmarketable
education
and
food
not
for
himself
alone
but
sometimes
for
a
dozen
helpless
relations
in
addition
to
his
own
family
for
those
people
are
astonishingly
unselfish
and
admirably
faithful
to
their
ties
of
kinship
among
us
i
think
there
is
nothing
approaching
it
strange
as
some
of
these
wailing
and
supplicating
letters
are
humble
and
even
groveling
as
some
of
them
are
and
quaintly
funny
and
confused
as
a
goodly
number
of
them
are
there
is
still
a
pathos
about
them
as
a
rule
that
checks
the
rising
laugh
and
reproaches
it
in
the
following
letter
father
is
not
to
be
read
literally
in
ceylon
a
little
native
embarrassed
me
by
calling
me
father
although
i
knew
she
was
mistaken
i
was
so
new
that
i
did
not
know
that
she
was
merely
following
the
custom
of
the
dependent
and
the
supplicant
sir
i
pray
please
to
give
me
some
action
work
for
i
am
very
poor
boy
i
have
no
one
to
help
me
even
so
father
for
it
so
it
seemed
in
thy
good
sight
you
give
the
telegraph
office
and
another
work
what
is
your
wish
i
am
very
poor
boy
this
understand
what
is
your
wish
you
my
father
i
am
your
son
this
understand
what
is
your
wish
your
sirvent
c
b
through
ages
of
debasing
oppression
suffered
by
these
people
at
the
hands
of
their
native
rulers
they
come
legitimately
by
the
attitude
and
language
of
fawning
and
flattery
and
one
must
remember
this
in
mitigation
when
passing
judgment
upon
the
native
character
it
is
common
in
these
letters
to
find
the
petitioner
furtively
trying
to
get
at
the
white
man
soft
religious
side
even
this
poor
boy
baits
his
hook
with
a
macerated
in
the
hope
that
it
may
catch
something
if
all
else
fail
here
is
an
application
for
the
post
of
instructor
in
english
to
some
children
my
dear
sir
or
gentleman
that
your
petitioner
has
much
qualification
in
the
language
of
english
to
instruct
the
young
boys
i
was
given
to
understand
that
your
of
suitable
children
has
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
english
language
as
a
sample
of
the
flowery
eastern
style
i
will
take
a
sentence
or
two
from
along
letter
written
by
a
young
native
to
the
of
bengal
an
application
for
employment
honored
and
much
respected
sir
i
hope
your
honor
will
condescend
to
hear
the
tale
of
this
poor
creature
i
shall
overflow
with
gratitude
at
this
mark
of
your
royal
condescension
the
happiness
has
flown
away
from
my
heart
and
has
not
hitherto
returned
from
the
period
whence
the
rose
of
my
father
life
suffered
the
autumnal
breath
of
death
in
plain
english
he
passed
through
the
gates
of
grave
and
from
that
hour
the
phantom
of
delight
has
never
danced
before
me
it
is
all
you
see
and
good
enough
too
all
things
considered
if
the
native
boy
had
but
that
one
study
he
would
shine
he
would
dazzle
no
doubt
but
that
is
not
the
case
he
is
situated
as
are
our
children
loaded
down
with
an
of
other
studies
and
frequently
they
are
as
far
beyond
the
actual
point
of
progress
reached
by
him
and
suited
to
the
stage
of
development
attained
as
could
be
imagined
by
the
insanest
fancy
apparently
like
our
boy
he
must
work
work
work
in
school
and
out
and
play
but
little
apparently
like
our
boy
his
education
consists
in
learning
things
not
the
meaning
of
them
he
is
fed
upon
the
husks
not
the
corn
from
several
essays
written
by
native
schoolboys
in
answer
to
the
question
of
how
they
spend
their
day
i
select
one
the
one
which
goes
most
into
detail
at
the
break
of
day
i
rises
from
my
own
bed
and
finish
my
daily
duty
then
i
employ
myself
till
after
which
i
employ
myself
to
bathe
then
take
for
my
body
some
sweet
meat
and
just
at
i
came
to
school
to
attend
my
class
duty
then
at
i
return
from
school
and
engage
myself
to
do
my
natural
duty
then
i
engage
for
a
quarter
to
take
my
tithn
then
i
study
till
after
which
i
began
to
play
anything
which
comes
in
my
head
after
half
pass
to
eight
we
are
began
to
sleep
before
sleeping
i
told
a
constable
just
o
he
came
and
rose
us
from
half
pass
eleven
we
began
to
read
still
morning
it
is
not
perfectly
clear
now
that
i
come
to
cipher
upon
it
he
gets
up
at
about
in
the
morning
or
along
there
somewhere
and
goes
to
bed
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
hours
afterward
that
much
of
it
seems
straight
but
why
he
should
rise
again
three
hours
later
and
resume
his
studies
till
morning
is
puzzling
i
think
it
is
because
he
is
studying
history
history
requires
a
world
of
time
and
bitter
hard
work
when
your
education
is
no
further
advanced
than
the
cat
when
you
are
merely
stuffing
yourself
with
a
mess
of
empty
names
and
random
incidents
and
elusive
dates
which
no
one
teaches
you
how
to
interpret
and
which
uninterpreted
pay
you
not
a
farthing
value
for
your
waste
of
time
yes
i
think
he
had
to
get
up
at
halfpast
in
order
to
be
sure
to
be
perfect
with
his
history
lesson
by
noon
with
results
as
follows
from
a
calcutta
school
examination
q
who
was
cardinal
wolsey
cardinal
wolsey
was
an
editor
of
a
paper
named
north
briton
no
of
his
publication
he
charged
the
king
of
uttering
a
lie
from
the
throne
he
was
arrested
and
cast
into
prison
and
after
releasing
went
to
france
as
bishop
of
york
but
died
in
disentry
in
a
church
on
his
way
to
be
blockheaded
cardinal
wolsey
was
the
son
of
edward
iv
after
his
father
death
he
himself
ascended
the
throne
at
the
age
of
ten
only
but
when
he
surpassed
or
when
he
was
fallen
in
his
twenty
years
of
age
at
that
time
he
wished
to
make
a
journey
in
his
countries
under
him
but
he
was
opposed
by
his
mother
to
do
journey
and
according
to
his
example
he
remained
in
the
home
and
then
became
king
after
many
times
obstacles
and
many
confusion
he
become
king
and
afterwards
his
brother
there
is
probably
not
a
word
of
truth
in
that
q
what
is
the
meaning
of
dien
an
honor
conferred
on
the
first
or
eldest
sons
of
english
sovereigns
it
is
nothing
more
than
some
feathers
ich
dien
was
the
word
which
was
written
on
the
feathers
of
the
blind
king
who
came
to
fight
being
interlaced
with
the
bridles
of
the
horse
ich
dien
is
a
title
given
to
henry
vii
by
the
pope
of
rome
when
he
forwarded
the
reformation
of
cardinal
wolsy
to
rome
and
for
this
reason
he
was
called
commander
of
the
faith
a
dozen
or
so
of
this
kind
of
insane
answers
are
quoted
in
the
book
from
that
examination
each
answer
is
sweeping
proof
all
by
itself
that
the
person
uttering
it
was
pushed
ahead
of
where
he
belonged
when
he
was
put
into
history
proof
that
he
had
been
put
to
the
task
of
acquiring
history
before
he
had
had
a
single
lesson
in
the
art
of
acquiring
it
which
is
the
equivalent
of
dumping
a
pupil
into
geometry
before
he
has
learned
the
progressive
steps
which
lead
up
to
it
and
make
its
acquirement
possible
those
calcutta
novices
had
no
business
with
history
there
was
no
excuse
for
examining
them
in
it
no
excuse
for
exposing
them
and
their
teachers
they
were
totally
empty
there
was
nothing
to
examine

sheriff
a
tittle
given
on
those
persons
who
were
respective
and
pious
in
england
the
students
were
examined
in
the
following
bulky
matters
geometry
the
solar
spectrum
the
habeas
corpus
act
the
british
parliament
and
in
metaphysics
they
were
asked
to
trace
the
progress
of
skepticism
from
descartes
to
hume
it
is
within
bounds
to
say
that
some
of
the
results
were
astonishing
without
doubt
there
were
students
present
who
justified
their
teacher
wisdom
in
introducing
them
to
these
studies
but
the
fact
is
also
evident
that
others
had
been
pushed
into
these
studies
to
waste
their
time
over
them
when
they
could
have
been
profitably
employed
in
hunting
smaller
game
under
the
head
of
geometry
one
of
the
answers
is
this
the
whole
bd
the
whole
ca
and
to
me
this
is
cloudy
but
i
was
never
well
up
in
geometry
that
was
the
only
effort
made
among
the
five
students
who
appeared
for
examination
in
geometry
the
other
four
wailed
and
surrendered
without
a
fight
they
are
piteous
wails
too
wails
of
despair
and
one
of
them
is
an
eloquent
reproach
it
comes
from
a
poor
fellow
who
has
been
laden
beyond
his
strength
by
a
stupid
teacher
and
is
eloquent
in
spite
of
the
poverty
of
its
english
the
poor
chap
finds
himself
required
to
explain
riddles
which
even
sir
isaac
newton
was
not
able
to
understand
oh
my
dear
father
examiner
you
my
father
and
you
kindly
give
a
number
of
pass
you
my
great
father
i
am
a
poor
boy
and
have
no
means
to
support
my
mother
and
two
brothers
who
are
suffering
much
for
want
of
food
i
get
four
rupees
monthly
from
charity
fund
of
this
place
from
which
i
send
two
rupees
for
their
support
and
keep
two
for
my
own
support
father
if
i
relate
the
unlucky
circumstance
under
which
we
are
placed
then
i
think
you
will
not
be
able
to
suppress
the
tender
tear
sir
which
sir
isaac
newton
and
other
experienced
mathematicians
can
not
understand
i
being
third
of
entrance
class
can
understand
these
which
is
too
impossible
to
imagine
and
my
examiner
also
has
put
very
tiresome
and
very
heavy
propositions
to
prove
we
must
remember
that
these
pupils
had
to
do
their
thinking
in
one
language
and
express
themselves
in
another
and
alien
one
it
was
a
heavy
handicap
i
have

an

that

one

that
one

is
no

better

the

a
few
verses
of

you
will
have
to
concede
that
he
did
it
the
man
who
rode

performed

an

made

the
following
paragraph
is
from
a
little
book
which
is
famous
in
india
the
biography
of
a
distinguished
hindoo
judge
onoocool
chunder
mookerjee
it
was
written
by
his
nephew
and
is
unintentionally
fact
exceedingly
so
i
offer
here
the
closing
scene
if
you
would
like
to
sample
the
rest
of
the
book
it
can
be
had
by
applying
to
the
publishers
thacker

having
said

it
proved
after
all
as
if

had
not
the
mournful
consolation
to
hear
his
last
words
he

we

and

again
ideal
the
difference
between
a
river
and
the
sea
is
that
the
river
looks
fluid
the
sea
solid
usually
looks
as
if
you
could
step
out
and
walk
on
it
the
captain
has
this
peculiarity
he
can
not
tell
the
truth
in
a
plausible
way
in
this
he
is
the
very
opposite
of
the
austere
scot
who
sits
midway
of
the
table
he
can
not
tell
a
lie
in
an
unplausible
way
when
the
captain
finishes
a
statement
the
passengers
glance
at
each
other
privately
as
who
should
say
do
you
believe
that
when
the
scot
finishes
one
the
look
says
how
strange
and
interesting
the
whole
secret
is
in
the
manner
and
method
of
the
two
men
the
captain
is
a
little
shy
and
diffident
and
he
states
the
simplest
fact
as
if
he
were
a
little
afraid
of
it
while
the
scot
delivers
himself
of
the
most
abandoned
lie
with
such
an
air
of
stern
veracity
that
one
is
forced
to
believe
it
although
one
knows
it
is
so
for
instance
the
scot
told
about
a
pet
he
once
owned
that
lived
in
a
little
fountain
in
his
conservatory
and
supported
itself
by
catching
birds
and
frogs
and
rats
in
the
neighboring
fields
it
was
plain
that
no
one
at
the
table
doubted
this
statement
by
and
by
in
the
course
of
some
talk
about
annoyances
the
captain
brought
out
the
following
simple
everyday
incident
but
through
his
infirmity
of
style
managed
to
tell
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
got
no
credence
he
said
i
went
ashore
at
naples
one
voyage
when
i
was
in
that
trade
and
stood
around
helping
my
passengers
for
i
could
speak
a
little
italian
two
or
three
times
at
intervals
the
officer
asked
me
if
i
had
anything
dutiable
about
me
and
seemed
more
and
more
put
out
and
disappointed
every
time
i
told
him
no
finally
a
passenger
whom
i
had
helped
through
asked
me
to
come
out
and
take
something
i
thanked
him
but
excused
myself
saying
i
had
taken
a
whisky
just
before
i
came
ashore
it
was
a
fatal
admission
the
officer
at
once
made
me
pay
sixpence
on
the
from
ship
to
shore
you
see
and
he
fined
me
for
not
declaring
the
goods
another
for
falsely
denying
that
i
had
anything
dutiable
about
me
also
for
concealing
the
goods
and
for
smuggling
which
is
the
maximum
penalty
for
unlawfully
bringing
in
goods
under
the
value
of
sevenpence
altogether
pounds
sixpence
for
a
little
thing
like
that
the
scot
is
always
believed
yet
he
never
tells
anything
but
lies
whereas
the
captain
is
never
believed
although
he
never
tells
a
lie
so
far
as
i
can
judge
if
he
should
say
his
uncle
was
a
male
person
he
would
probably
say
it
in
such
a
way
that
nobody
would
believe
it
at
the
same
time
the
scot
could
claim
that
he
had
a
female
uncle
and
not
stir
a
doubt
in
anybody
mind
my
own
luck
has
been
curious
all
my
literary
life
i
never
could
tell
a
lie
that
anybody
would
doubt
nor
a
truth
that
anybody
would
believe
lots
of
pets
on
board
birds
and
things
in
these
far
countries
the
white
people
do
seem
to
run
remarkably
to
pets
our
host
in
cawnpore
had
a
fine
collection
of
birds
the
finest
we
saw
in
a
private
house
in
india
and
in
colombo
murray
great
compound
and
commodious
bungalow
were
well
populated
with
domesticated
company
from
the
woods
frisky
little
squirrels
a
ceylon
mina
walking
sociably
about
the
house
a
small
green
parrot
that
whistled
a
single
urgent
note
of
call
without
motion
of
its
beak
also
chuckled
a
monkey
in
a
cage
on
the
back
veranda
and
some
more
out
in
the
trees
also
a
number
of
beautiful
macaws
in
the
trees
and
various
and
sundry
birds
and
animals
of
breeds
not
known
to
me
but
no
cat
yet
a
cat
would
have
liked
that
place
april
is
the
great
business
in
ceylon
now
a
passenger
says
it
often
pays
per
cent
on
the
investment
says
there
is
a
boom
april
the
sea
is
a
mediterranean
blue
and
i
believe
that
that
is
about
the
divinest
color
known
to
nature
it
is
strange
and
fine
nature
lavish
generosities
to
her
creatures
at
least
to
all
of
them
except
man
for
those
that
fly
she
has
provided
a
home
that
is
nobly
spacious
a
home
which
is
forty
miles
deep
and
envelops
the
whole
globe
and
has
not
an
obstruction
in
it
for
those
that
swim
she
has
provided
a
more
than
imperial
domain
a
domain
which
is
miles
deep
and
covers
of
the
globe
but
as
for
man
she
has
cut
him
off
with
the
mere
odds
and
ends
of
the
creation
she
has
given
him
the
thin
skin
the
meagre
skin
which
is
stretched
over
the
remaining
the
naked
bones
stick
up
through
it
in
most
places
on
the
of
this
domain
he
can
raise
snow
ice
sand
rocks
and
nothing
else
so
the
valuable
part
of
his
inheritance
really
consists
of
but
a
single
fifth
of
the
family
estate
and
out
of
it
he
has
to
grub
hard
to
get
enough
to
keep
him
alive
and
provide
kings
and
soldiers
and
powder
to
extend
the
blessings
of
civilization
with
yet
man
in
his
simplicity
and
complacency
and
inability
to
cipher
thinks
nature
regards
him
as
the
important
member
of
the
family
in
fact
her
favorite
surely
it
must
occur
to
even
his
dull
head
sometimes
that
she
has
a
curious
way
of
showing
it
afternoon
the
captain
has
been
telling
how
in
one
of
his
arctic
voyages
it
was
so
cold
that
the
mate
shadow
froze
fast
to
the
deck
and
had
to
be
ripped
loose
by
main
strength
and
even
then
he
got
only
about
of
it
back
nobody
said
anything
and
the
captain
went
away
i
think
he
is
becoming
disheartened
also
to
be
fair
there
is
another
word
of
praise
due
to
this
ship
library
it
contains
no
copy
of
the
vicar
of
wakefield
that
strange
menagerie
of
complacent
hypocrites
and
idiots
of
theatrical
heroes
and
heroines
who
are
always
showing
off
of
bad
people
who
are
not
interesting
and
good
people
who
are
fatiguing
a
singular
book
not
a
sincere
line
in
it
and
not
a
character
that
invites
respect
a
book
which
is
one
long
discharge
of
puerilities
and
dreary
moralities
a
book
which
is
full
of
pathos
which
revolts
and
humor
which
grieves
the
heart
there
are
few
things
in
literature
that
are
more
piteous
more
pathetic
than
the
celebrated
humorous
incident
of
moses
and
the
spectacles
jane
austen
books
too
are
absent
from
this
library
just
that
one
omission
alone
would
make
a
fairly
good
library
out
of
a
library
that
had
a
book
in
it
customs
in
tropic
seas
at
in
the
morning
they
pipe
to
wash
down
the
decks
and
at
once
the
ladies
who
are
sleeping
there
turn
out
and
they
and
their
beds
go
below
then
one
after
another
the
men
come
up
from
the
bath
in
their
pyjamas
and
walk
the
decks
an
hour
or
two
with
bare
legs
and
bare
feet
coffee
and
fruit
served
the
ship
cat
and
her
kitten
now
appear
and
get
about
their
toilets
next
the
barber
comes
and
flays
us
on
the
breezy
deck
breakfast
at
and
the
day
begins
i
do
not
know
how
a
day
could
be
more
reposeful
no
motion
a
level
blue
sea
nothing
in
sight
from
horizon
to
horizon
the
speed
of
the
ship
furnishes
a
cooling
breeze
there
is
no
mail
to
read
and
answer
no
newspapers
to
excite
you
no
telegrams
to
fret
you
or
fright
you
the
world
is
far
far
away
it
has
ceased
to
exist
for
you
seemed
a
fading
dream
along
in
the
first
days
has
dissolved
to
an
unreality
now
it
is
gone
from
your
mind
with
all
its
businesses
and
ambitions
its
prosperities
and
disasters
its
exultations
and
despairs
its
joys
and
griefs
and
cares
and
worries
they
are
no
concern
of
yours
any
more
they
have
gone
out
of
your
life
they
are
a
storm
which
has
passed
and
left
a
deep
calm
behind
the
people
group
themselves
about
the
decks
in
their
snowy
white
linen
and
read
smoke
sew
play
cards
talk
nap
and
so
on
in
other
ships
the
passengers
are
always
ciphering
about
when
they
are
going
to
arrive
out
in
these
seas
it
is
rare
very
rare
to
hear
that
subject
broached
in
other
ships
there
is
always
an
eager
rush
to
the
bulletin
board
at
noon
to
find
out
what
the
run
has
been
in
these
seas
the
bulletin
seems
to
attract
no
interest
i
have
seen
no
one
visit
it
in
thirteen
days
i
have
visited
it
only
once
then
i
happened
to
notice
the
figures
of
the
run
on
that
day
there
happened
to
be
talk
at
dinner
about
the
speed
of
modern
ships
i
was
the
only
passenger
present
who
knew
this
gait
necessarily
the
atlantic
custom
of
betting
on
the
ship
run
is
not
a
custom
here
nobody
ever
mentions
it
i
myself
am
wholly
indifferent
as
to
when
we
are
going
to
get
in
if
any
one
else
feels
interested
in
the
matter
he
has
not
indicated
it
in
my
hearing
if
i
had
my
way
we
should
never
get
in
at
all
this
sort
of
sea
life
is
charged
with
an
indestructible
charm
there
is
no
weariness
no
fatigue
no
worry
no
responsibility
no
work
no
depression
of
spirits
there
is
nothing
like
this
serenity
this
comfort
this
peace
this
deep
contentment
to
be
found
anywhere
on
land
if
i
had
my
way
i
would
sail
on
for
ever
and
never
go
to
live
on
the
solid
ground
again
one
of
kipling
ballads
has
delivered
the
aspect
and
sentiment
of

bewitching

clouds
a
man
of
more
experience
in
the
business
showed
one
of
them
to
me
last
night
it
was
small
and
faint
and
delicate
and
looked
like
the
ghost
of
a

of

smoke
left
floating

indians
quadroons
and
great
varieties
in
costumes
and
colors
took
the
train
for
curepipe
at
two
hours
run
gradually
uphill
what
a
contrast
this
frantic
luxuriance
of
vegetation
with
the
arid
plains
of
india
these
architecturally
picturesque
crags
and
knobs
and
miniature
mountains
with
the
monotony
of
the
indian
a
native
pointed
out
a
handsome
swarthy
man
of
grave
and
dignified
bearing
and
said
in
an
awed
tone
that
is
has
held
office
of
one
sort
or
another
under
this
government
for
years
he
is
known
all
over
this
whole
island
and
in
the
other
countries
of
the
world
perhaps
who
knows
one
thing
is
certain
you
can
speak
his
name
anywhere
in
this
whole
island
and
you
will
find
not
one
grown
person
that
has
not
heard
it
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
to
be
so
celebrated
yet
look
at
him
it
makes
no
change
in
him
he
does
not
even
seem
to
know
it
curepipe
means
pincushion
or
pegtown
probably
sixteen
miles
two
hours
by
rail
from
port
louis
at
each
end
of
every
roof
and
on
the
apex
of
every
dormer
window
a
wooden
peg
two
feet
high
stands
up
in
some
cases
its
top
is
blunt
in
others
the
peg
is
sharp
and
looks
like
a
toothpick
the
passion
for
this
humble
ornament
is
universal
apparently
there
has
been
only
one
prominent
event
in
the
history
of
mauritius
and
that
one
did
happen
i
refer
to
the
romantic
sojourn
of
paul
and
virginia
here
it
was
that
story
that
made
mauritius
known
to
the
world
made
the
name
familiar
to
everybody
the
geographical
position
of
it
to
nobody
a
clergyman
was
asked
to
guess
what
was
in
a
box
on
a
table
it
was
a
vellum
fan
painted
with
the
shipwreck
and
was
one
of
virginia
wedding
gifts
april
this
is
the
only
country
in
the
world
where
the
stranger
is
not
asked
how
do
you
like
this
place
this
is
indeed
a
large
distinction
here
the
citizen
does
the
talking
about
the
country
himself
the
stranger
is
not
asked
to
help
you
get
all
sorts
of
information
from
one
citizen
you
gather
the
idea
that
mauritius
was
made
first
and
then
heaven
and
that
heaven
was
copied
after
mauritius
another
one
tells
you
that
this
is
an
exaggeration
that
the
two
chief
villages
port
louis
and
curepipe
fall
short
of
heavenly
perfection
that
nobody
lives
in
port
louis
except
upon
compulsion
and
that
curepipe
is
the
wettest
and
rainiest
place
in
the
world
an
english
citizen
said
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
mauritius
was
used
by
the
french
as
a
basis
from
which
to
operate
against
england
indian
merchantmen
so
england
captured
the
island
and
also
the
neighbor
bourbon
to
stop
that
annoyance
england
gave
bourbon
back
the
government
in
london
did
not
want
any
more
possessions
in
the
west
indies
if
the
government
had
had
a
better
quality
of
geography
in
stock
it
would
not
have
wasted
bourbon
in
that
foolish
way
a
big
war
will
temporarily
shut
up
the
suez
canal
some
day
and
the
english
ships
will
have
to
go
to
india
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
again
then
england
will
have
to
have
bourbon
and
will
take
it
mauritius
was
a
crown
colony
until
years
ago
with
a
governor
appointed
by
the
crown
and
assisted
by
a
council
appointed
by
himself
but
pope
hennessey
came
out
as
governor
then
and
he
worked
hard
to
get
a
part
of
the
council
made
elective
and
succeeded
so
now
the
whole
council
is
french
and
in
all
ordinary
matters
of
legislation
they
vote
together
and
in
the
french
interest
not
the
english
the
english
population
is
very
slender
it
has
not
votes
enough
to
elect
a
legislator
half
a
dozen
rich
french
families
elect
the
legislature
pope
hennessey
was
an
irishman
a
catholic
a
home
ruler
a
hater
of
england
and
the
english
a
very
troublesome
person
and
a
serious
incumbrance
at
westminster
so
it
was
decided
to
send
him
out
to
govern
unhealthy
countries
in
hope
that
something
would
happen
to
him
but
nothing
did
the
first
experiment
was
not
merely
a
failure
it
was
more
than
a
failure
he
proved
to
be
more
of
a
disease
himself
than
any
he
was
sent
to
encounter
the
next
experiment
was
here
the
dark
scheme
failed
again
it
was
an
and
there
was
nothing
but
measles
here
at
the
time
pope
hennessey
health
was
not
affected
he
worked
with
the
french
and
for
the
french
and
against
the
english
and
he
made
the
english
very
tired
and
the
french
very
happy
and
lived
to
have
the
joy
of
seeing
the
flag
he
served
publicly
hissed
his
memory
is
held
in
worshipful
reverence
and
affection
by
the
french
it
is
a
land
of
extraordinary
quarantines
they
quarantine
a
ship
for
anything
or
for
nothing
quarantine
her
for
and
even
days
they
once
quarantined
a
ship
because
her
captain
had
had
the
smallpox
when
he
was
a
boy
that
and
because
he
was
english
the
population
is
very
small
small
to
insignificance
the
majority
is
east
indian
then
mongrels
then
negroes
descendants
of
the
slaves
of
the
french
times
then
french
then
english
there
was
an
american
but
he
is
dead
or
mislaid
the
mongrels
are
the
result
of
all
kinds
of
mixtures
black
and
white
mulatto
and
white
quadroon
and
white
octoroon
and
white
and
so
there
is
every
shade
of

this

the

the

tropical
climates
you
would
expect
a
person
to
be
proud
of
being
a
mauritian
now
would
you
but
it
is
so
the
most
of
them
have
never
been
out
of
the
island
and
have
read
much
or
studied
much
and
they
think
the
world
consists
of
three
principal
countries
judaea
france
and
mauritius
so
they
are
very
proud
of
belonging
to
one
of
the
three
grand
divisions
of
the
globe
they
think
that
russia
and
germany
are
in
england
and
that
england
does
not
amount
to
much
they
have
heard
vaguely
about
the
united
states
and
the
equator
but
they
think
both
of
them
are
monarchies
they
think
mount
peter
botte
is
the
highest
mountain
in
the
world
and
if
you
show
one
of
them
a
picture
of
milan
cathedral
he
will
swell
up
with
satisfaction
and
say
that
the
idea
of
that
jungle
of
spires
was
stolen
from
the
forest
of
and
toothpicks
that
makes
the
roofs
of
curepipe
look
so
fine
and
prickly
there
is
not
much
trade
in
books
the
newspapers
educate
and
entertain
the
people
mainly
the
latter
they
have
two
pages
of
of
them
english
the
other
french
the
english
page
is
a
translation
of
the
french
one
the
typography
is
primitive
in
this
quality
it
has
not
its
equal
anywhere
there
is
no
now
he
is
dead
where
do
they
get
matter
to
fill
up
a
page
in
this
little
island
lost
in
the
wastes
of
the
indian
ocean
oh
madagascar
they
discuss
madagascar
and
france
that
is
the
bulk
then
they
chock
up
the
rest
with
advice
to
the
government
also
slurs
upon
the
english
administration
the
papers
are
all
owned
and
edited
by
creoles
french
the
language
of
the
country
is
french
everybody
speaks
it
has
to
you
have
to
know
french
particularly
mongrel
french
the
patois
spoken
by
tom
dick
and
harry
of
the
multiform
complexions
or
you
ca
get
along
this
was
a
flourishing
country
in
former
days
for
it
made
then
and
still
makes
the
best
sugar
in
the
world
but
first
the
suez
canal
severed
it
from
the
world
and
left
it
out
in
the
cold
and
next
the
beetroot
sugar
helped
by
bounties
captured
the
european
markets
sugar
is
the
life
of
mauritius
and
it
is
losing
its
grip
its
downward
course
was
checked
by
the
depreciation
of
the
rupee
for
the
planter
pays
wages
in
rupees
but
sells
his
crop
for
gold
and
the
insurrection
in
cuba
and
paralyzation
of
the
sugar
industry
there
have
given
our
prices
here
a
lift
but
the
outlook
has
nothing
permanently
favorable
about
it
it
takes
a
year
to
mature
the
canes
on
the
high
ground
three
and
six
months
longer
and
there
is
always
a
chance
that
the
annual
cyclone
will
rip
the
profit
out
of
the
crop
in
recent
times
a
cyclone
took
the
whole
crop
as
you
may
say
and
the
island
never
saw
a
finer
one
some
of
the
noblest
sugar
estates
in
the
island
are
in
deep
difficulties
a
dozen
of
them
are
investments
of
english
capital
and
the
companies
that
own
them
are
at
work
now
trying
to
settle
up
and
get
out
with
a
saving
of
half
the
money
they
put
in
you
know
in
these
days
when
a
country
begins
to
introduce
the
tea
culture
it
means
that
its
own
specialty
has
gone
back
on
it
look
at
bengal
look
at
ceylon
well
they
begun
to
introduce
the
tea
culture
here
many
copies
of
paul
and
virginia
are
sold
every
year
in
mauritius
no
other
book
is
so
popular
here
except
the
bible
by
many
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
part
of
the
bible
all
the
missionaries
work
up
their
french
on
it
when
they
come
here
to
pervert
the
catholic
mongrel
it
is
the
greatest
story
that
was
ever
written
about
mauritius
and
the
only
one
chapter
lxiii
the
principal
difference
between
a

is
that

by

gazette
from
the
article
of
a
regular
contributor

concerning
the
death
of
the
nephew
of
a
prominent
citizen
sad
and
lugubrious
existence
this
which
we
lead
in
mauritius
i
believe
there
is
no
other
country
in
the
world
where
one
dies
more
easily
than
among
us
the
least
indisposition
becomes
a
mortal
malady
a
simple
headache
develops
into
meningitis
a
cold
into
pneumonia
and
presently
when
we
are
least
expecting
it
death
is
a
guest
in
our
home
this
daily
paper
has
a
meteorological
report
which
tells
you
what
the
weather
was
day
before
yesterday
one
is
clever
pestered
by
a
beggar
or
a
peddler
in
this
town
so
far
as
i
can
see
this
is
pleasantly
different
from
india
april
to
such
as
believe
that
the
quaint
product
called
french
civilization
would
be
an
improvement
upon
the
civilization
of
new
guinea
and
the
like
the
snatching
of
madagascar
and
the
laying
on
of
french
civilization
there
will
be
fully
justified
but
why
did
the
english
allow
the
french
to
have
madagascar
did
she
respect
a
theft
of
a
couple
of
centuries
ago
dear
me
robbery
by
european
nations
of
each
territories
has
never
been
a
sin
is
not
a
sin
to
the
several
cabinets
the
several
political
establishments
of
the
world
are
clotheslines
and
a
large
part
of
the
official
duty
of
these
cabinets
is
to
keep
an
eye
on
each
other
wash
and
grab
what
they
can
of
it
as
opportunity
offers
all
the
territorial
possessions
of
all
the
political
establishments
in
the
earth
including
america
of
course
consist
of
pilferings
from
other
people
no
tribe
howsoever
insignificant
and
no
nation
howsoever
mighty
occupies
a
foot
of
land
that
was
not
stolen
when
the
english
the
french
and
the
spaniards
reached
america
the
indian
tribes
had
been
raiding
each
other
territorial
for
ages
and
every
acre
of
ground
in
the
continent
had
been
stolen
and
times
the
english
the
french
and
the
spaniards
went
to
work
and
stole
it
all
over
again
and
when
that
was
satisfactorily
accomplished
they
went
diligently
to
work
and
stole
it
from
each
other
in
europe
and
asia
and
africa
every
acre
of
ground
has
been
stolen
several
millions
of
times
a
crime
persevered
in
a
thousand
centuries
ceases
to
be
a
crime
and
becomes
a
virtue
this
is
the
law
of
custom
and
custom
supersedes
all
other
forms
of
law
christian
governments
are
as
frank
as
open
and
in
discussing
projects
for
raiding
each
other
as
ever
they
were
before
the
golden
rule
came
smiling
into
this
inhospitable
world
and
could
get
a
lodging
anywhere
in
years
england
has
beneficently
retired
garment
after
garment
from
the
indian
lines
until
there
is
hardly
a
rag
of
the
original
wash
left
dangling
anywhere
in
years
an
obscure
tribe
of
muscovite
savages
has
risen
to
the
dazzling
position
of
she
found
a
quarter
of
the
world
hanging
out
to
dry
on
a
hundred
parallels
of
latitude
and
she
scooped
in
the
whole
she
keeps
a
sharp
eye
on
a
multitude
of
little
lines
that
stretch
along
the
northern
boundaries
of
india
and
every
now
and
then
she
snatches
a
or
a
pair
of
pyjamas
it
is
england
prospective
property
and
russia
knows
it
but
russia
cares
nothing
for
that
in
fact
in
our
day
is
become
a
european
governmental
frenzy
some
have
been
hard
at
it
in
the
borders
of
china
in
burma
in
siam
and
the
islands
of
the
sea
and
all
have
been
at
it
in
africa
africa
has
been
as
coolly
divided
up
and
portioned
out
among
the
gang
as
if
they
had
bought
it
and
paid
for
it
and
now
straightway
they
are
beginning
the
old
game
again
to
steal
each
other
grabbings
germany
found
a
vast
slice
of
central
africa
with
the
english
flag
and
the
english
missionary
and
the
english
trader
scattered
all
over
it
but
with
certain
formalities
neglected
no
signs
up
keep
off
the
grass
and
she
stepped
in
with
a
cold
calm
smile
and
put
up
the
signs
herself
and
swept
those
english
pioneers
promptly
out
of
the
country
there
is
a
tremendous
point
there
it
can
be
put
into
the
form
of
a
maxim
get
your
formalities
right
never
mind
about
the
moralities
it
was
an
impudent
thing
but
england
had
to
put
up
with
it
now
in
the
case
of
madagascar
the
formalities
had
originally
been
observed
but
by
neglect
they
had
fallen
into
desuetude
ages
ago
england
should
have
snatched
madagascar
from
the
french
without
an
effort
she
could
have
saved
those
harmless
natives
from
the
calamity
of
french
civilization
and
she
did
not
do
it
now
it
is
too
late
the
signs
of
the
times
show
plainly
enough
what
is
going
to
happen
all
the
savage
lands
in
the
world
are
going
to
be
brought
under
subjection
to
the
christian
governments
of
europe
i
am
not
sorry
but
glad
this
coming
fate
might
have
been
a
calamity
to
those
savage
peoples
two
hundred
years
ago
but
now
it
will
in
some
cases
be
a
benefaction
the
sooner
the
seizure
is
consummated
the
better
for
the
savages
the
dreary
and
dragging
ages
of
bloodshed
and
disorder
and
oppression
will
give
place
to
peace
and
order
and
the
reign
of
law
when
one
considers
what
india
was
under
her
hindoo
and
mohammedan
rulers
and
what
she
is
now
when
he
remembers
the
miseries
of
her
millions
then
and
the
protections
and
humanities
which
they
enjoy
now
he
must
concede
that
the
most
fortunate
thing
that
has
ever
befallen
that
empire
was
the
establishment
of
british
supremacy
there
the
savage
lands
of
the
world
are
to
pass
to
alien
possession
their
peoples
to
the

population
the
increase
is
due
mainly
to
the
introduction
of
indian
coolies
they
now
apparently
form
the
great
majority
of
the
population
they
are
admirable
breeders
their
homes
are
always
hazy
with
children
great
savers
of
money
a
british
officer
told
me
that
in
india
he
paid
his
servant
rupees
a
month
and
he
had
cousins
uncles
parents
dependent
upon
him
and
he
supported
them
on
his
wages
these
thrifty
coolies
are
said
to
be
acquiring
land
a
trifle
at
a
time
and
cultivating
it
and
may
own
the
island
by
and
by
the
indian

very
hard

the
camaron

here
as

certainly
it

a
fine

or
they
say
for
poaching
bait
is
thrown
in

the
camaron
goes
for
it
the
fisher
drops
his
loop
in
and
works
it
around
and
about
the
camaron
he
has
selected
till
he
gets
it
over
its
tail
then
there
a
jerk
or
something
to
certify
the
camaron
that
it
is
his
turn
now
he
suddenly
backs
away
which
moves
the
loop
still
further
up
his
person
and
draws
it
taut
and
his
days
are
ended
another
dish
called
palmiste
is
like
raw
and
tastes
like
green
almonds
is
very
delicate
and
good
costs
the

of

tree
to

for
it

another
dish
looks
like

in

they

the
cyclone
of
tore
down
two
great
blocks
of

in
the

of

the
chief

left
the
uncomely
and
apparently
frail
blocks
standing
everywhere
in
its
track
it
annihilated
houses
tore
off
roofs
destroyed
trees
and
crops
the
men
were
in
the
towns
the
women
and
children
at
home
in
the
country
getting
crippled
killed
frightened
to
insanity
and
the
rain
deluging
them
the
wind
howling
the
thunder
crashing
the
lightning
glaring
this
for
an
hour
or
so
then
a
lull
and
sunshine
many
ventured
out
of
safe
shelter
then
suddenly
here
it
came
again
from
the
opposite
point
and
renewed
and
completed
the
devastation
it
is
said
the
chinese
fed
the
sufferers
for
days
on
free
rice
whole
streets
in
port
louis
were
laid
flat
wrecked
during
a
minute
and
a
half
the
wind
blew
miles
an
hour
no
official

made
after
that
when
it
may
have
reached
it
cut

it
carried

american
ship
into

after
breaking
the
chains
of
two

they
now
use
forward
two
astern
common
report
says
it
killed
in
port
louis
alone
in
half
an
hour
then
came
the
lull
of
the
central
calm
people
did
not
know
the
barometer
was
still
going
down
then
suddenly
all
perdition
broke
loose
again
while
people
were
rushing
around
seeking
friends
and
rescuing
the
wounded
the
noise
was
comparable
to
nothing
there
is
nothing
resembling
it
but
thunder
and
cannon
and
these
are
feeble
in
comparison
what
there
is
of
mauritius
is
beautiful
you
have
undulating
wide
expanses
of
a
fine
fresh
green
and
very
pleasant
to
the
eye
and
everywhere
else
you
have
a
ragged
luxuriance
of
tropic
vegetation
of
vivid
greens
of
varying
shades
a
wild
tangle
of
underbrush
with
graceful
tall
palms
lifting
their
crippled
plumes
high
above
it
and
you
have
stretches
of
shady
dense
forest
with
limpid
streams
frolicking
through
them
continually
glimpsed
and
lost
and
glimpsed
again
in
the
pleasantest
fashion
and
you
have
some
tiny
mountains
some
quaint
and
picturesque
groups
of
toy
peaks
and
a
dainty
little
matterhorn
and
here
and
there
and
now
and
then
a
strip
of
sea
with
a
white
ruffle
of
surf
breaks
into
the
view
that
is
mauritius
and
pretty
enough
the
details
are
few
the
massed
result
is
charming
but
not
imposing
not
riotous
not
exciting
it
is
a
sunday
landscape
perspective
and
the
enchantments
wrought
by
distance
are
wanting
there
are
no
distances
there
is
no
perspective
so
to
speak
fifteen
miles
as
the
crow
flies
is
the
usual
limit
of
vision
mauritius
is
a
garden
and
a
park
combined
it
affects
one
emotions
as
parks
and
gardens
affect
them
the
surfaces
of
one
spiritual
deeps
are
pleasantly
played
upon
the
deeps
themselves
are
not
reached
not
stirred
spaciousness
remote
altitudes
the
sense
of
mystery
which
haunts
apparently
inaccessible
mountain
domes
and
summits
reposing
in
the
sky
these
are
the
things
which
exalt
the
spirit
and
move
it
to
see
visions
and
dream
dreams
the
sandwich
islands
remain
my
ideal
of
the
perfect
thing
in
the
matter
of
tropical
islands
i
would
add
another
story
to
mauna
loa
feet
if
i
could
and
make
it
particularly
bold
and
steep
and
craggy
and
forbidding
and
snowy
and
i
would
make
the
volcano
spout
its
out
of
its
summit
instead
of
its
sides
but
aside
from
these
i
have
no
corrections
to
suggest
i
hope
these
will
be
attended
to
i
do
not
wish
to
have
to
speak
of
it
again

it

the

the
arundel
castle
is
the
finest
boat
i
have
seen
in
these
seas
she
is
thoroughly
modern
and
that
statement
covers
a
great
deal
of
ground
she
has
the
usual
defect
the
common
defect
the
universal
defect
the
defect
that
has
never
been
missing
from
any
ship
that
ever
sailed
she
has
imperfect
beds
many
ships
have
good
beds
but
no
ship
has
very
good
ones
in
the
matter
of
beds
all
ships
have
been
badly
edited
ignorantly
edited
from
the
beginning
the
selection
of
the
beds
is
given
to
some
hearty
man
when
it
ought
to
be
given
to
a
frail
woman
accustomed
from
girlhood
to
backaches
and
insomnia
nothing
is
so
rare
on
either
side
of
the
ocean
as
a
perfect
bed
nothing
is
so
difficult
to
make
some
of
the
hotels
on
both
sides
provide
it
but
no
ship
ever
does
or
ever
did
in
noah
ark
the
beds
were
simply
scandalous
noah
set
the
fashion
and
it
will
endure
in
one
degree
of
modification
or
another
till
the
next

passing
isle
de
bourbon
of

in

surely
it
would
not
cost
much
to
repair
them
and
it
seems
inexcusable
neglect
to
leave
them
as
they
are
it
seems
stupid
to
send
tired
men
to
europe
to
rest
it
is
no
proper
rest
for
the
mind
to
clatter
from
town
to
town
in
the
dust
and
cinders
and
examine
galleries
and
architecture
and
be
always
meeting
people
and
lunching
and
teaing
and
dining
and
receiving
worrying
cables
and
letters
and
a
sea
voyage
on
the
atlantic
is
of
no
use
voyage
too
short
sea
too
rough
the
peaceful
indian
and
pacific
oceans
and
the
long
stretches
of
time
are
the
healing
thing
may
am
a
fair
great
ship
in
sight
almost
the
first
we
have
seen
in
these
weeks
of
lonely
voyaging
we
are
now
in
the
mozambique
channel
between
madagascar
and
south
africa
sailing
straight
west
for
delagoa
bay
last
night
the
burly
chief
engineer
was
standing
telling
a
spirited
seafaring
tale
and
had
reached
the
most
exciting
place
where
a
man
overboard
was
washing
swiftly
astern
on
the
great
seas
and
uplifting
despairing
cries
everybody
racing
aft
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
and
fading
hope
when
the
band
which
had
been
silent
a
moment
began
impressively
its
closing
piece
the
english
national
anthem
as
simply
as
if
he
was
unconscious
of
what
he
was
doing
he
stopped
his
story
uncovered
laid
his
laced
cap
against
his
breast
and
slightly
bent
his
grizzled
head
the
few
bars
finished
he
put
on
his
cap
and
took
up
his
tale
again
as
naturally
as
if
that
interjection
of
music
had
been
a
part
of
it
there
was
something
touching
and
fine
about
it
and
it
was
moving
to
reflect
that
he
was
one
of
a
myriad
scattered
over
every
part
of
the
globe
who
by
turn
was
doing
as
he
was
doing
every
hour
of
the
those
awake
doing
it
while
the
others
slept
those
impressive
bars
forever
floating
up
out
of
the
various
climes
never
silent
and
never
lacking
reverent
listeners
all
that
i
remember
about
madagascar
is
that
thackeray
little
billie
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
mast
and
there
knelt
him
upon
his
knee
saying
i
see
jerusalem
and
madagascar
and
north
and
south
amerikee
may
sunday
fifteen
or
twenty
africanders
who
will
end
their
voyage
and
strike
for
their
several
homes
from
delagoa
bay
sat
up
singing
on
the
afterdeck
in
the
moonlight
till
good
fun
and
wholesome
and
the
songs
were
clean
songs
and
some
of
them
were
hallowed
by
tender
associations
finally
in
a
pause
a
man
asked
have
you
heard
about
the
fellow
that
kept
a
diary
crossing
the
atlantic
it
was
a
discord
a
wet
blanket
the
men
were
not
in
the
mood
for
humorous
dirt
the
songs
had
carried
them
to
their
homes
and
in
spirit
they
sat
by
those
far
hearthstones
and
saw
faces
and
heard
voices
other
than
those
that
were
about
them
and
so
this
disposition
to
drag
in
an
old
indecent
anecdote
got
no
welcome
nobody
answered
the
poor
man
had
wit
enough
to
see
that
he
had
blundered
but
asked
his
question
again
again
there
was
no
response
it
was
embarrassing
for
him
in
his
confusion
he
chose
the
wrong
course
did
the
wrong
thing
began
the
anecdote
began
it
in
a
deep
and
hostile
stillness
where
had
been
such
life
and
stir
and
warm
comradeship
before
he
delivered
himself
of
the
brief
details
of
the
diary
first
day
and
did
it
with
some
confidence
and
a
fair
degree
of
eagerness
it
fell
flat
there
was
an
awkward
pause
the
two
rows
of
men
sat
like
statues
there
was
no
movement
no
sound
he
had
to
go
on
there
was
no
other
way
at
least
none
that
an
animal
of
his
calibre
could
think
of
at
the
close
of
each
day
diary
the
same
dismal
silence
followed
when
at
last
he
finished
his
tale
and
sprung
the
indelicate
surprise
which
is
wont
to
fetch
a
crash
of
laughter
not
a
ripple
of
sound
resulted
it
was
as
if
the
tale
had
been
told
to
dead
men
after
what
seemed
a
long
long
time
somebody
sighed
somebody
else
stirred
in
his
seat
presently
the
men
dropped
into
a
low
murmur
of
confidential
talk
each
with
his
neighbor
and
the
incident
was
closed
there
were
indications
that
that
man
was
fond
of
his
anecdote
that
it
was
his
pet
his
standby
his
shot
that
never
missed
his
but
he
will
never
tell
it
again
no
doubt
he
will
think
of
it
sometimes
for
that
can
not
well
be
helped
and
then
he
will
see
a
picture
and
always
the
same
picture
the
double
rank
of
dead
men
the
vacant
deck
stretching
away
in
dimming
perspective
beyond
them
the
wide
desert
of
smooth
sea
all
abroad
the
rim
of
the
moon
spying
from
behind
a
rag
of
black
cloud
the
remote
top
of
the
mizzenmast
shearing
a
zigzag
path
through
the
fields
of
stars
in
the
deeps
of
space
and
this
soft
picture
will
remind
him
of
the
time
that
he
sat
in
the
midst
of
it
and
told
his
poor
little
tale
and
felt
so
lonesome
when
he
got
through
fifty
indians
and
chinamen
asleep
in
a
big
tent
in
the
waist
of
the
ship
forward
they
lie
side
by
side
with
no
space
between
the
former
wrapped
up
head
and
all
as
in
the
indian
streets
the
chinamen
uncovered
the
lamp
and
things
for
opium
smoking
in
the
center
a
passenger
said
it
was
ten
truck
loads
of
dynamite
that
lately
exploded
at
johannesburg
hundreds
killed
he
does
know
how
many
limbs
picked
up
for
miles
around
glass
shattered
and
roofs
swept
away
or
collapsed
yards
off
fragment
of
iron
flung
three
and
a
half
miles
it
occurred
at
at
had
been
subscribed
when
this
passenger
left
had
been
voted
by
city
and
state
governments
and
by
citizens
and
business
corporations
when
news
of
the
disaster
was
telephoned
to
the
exchange
were
subscribed
in
the
first
five
minutes
subscribing
was
still
going
on
when
he
left
the
papers
had
ceased
the
names
only
the
amounts
too
many
names
not
enough
room
subscribed
by
companies
and
citizens
if
this
is
true
it
must
be
what
they
call
in
australia
a
record
the
biggest
instance
of
a
spontaneous
outpour
for
charity
in
history
considering
the
size
of
the
population
it
was
drawn
from
or
for
each
white
resident
babies
at
the
breast
included
monday
may
steaming
slowly
in
the
stupendous
delagoa
bay
its
dim
arms
stretching
far
away
and
disappearing
on
both
sides
it
could
furnish
plenty
of
room
for
all
the
ships
in
the
world
but
it
is
shoal
the
lead
has
given
us
fathoms
several
times
and
we
are
drawing
that
lacking
inches
a
bold
headland
precipitous
wall
feet
high
very
strong
red
color
stretching
a
mile
or
so
a
man
said
it
was
portuguese
blood
battle
fought
here
with
the
natives
last
year
i
think
this
doubtful
pretty
cluster
of
houses
on
the
tableland
above
the
rolling
stretches
of
grass
and
groups
of
trees
like
england
the
portuguese
have
the
railroad
one
passenger
train
a
day
to
the
border
miles
then
the
netherlands
company
have
it
thousands
of
tons
of
freight
on
the
shore
no
cover
this
is
portuguese
allover
indolence
piousness
poverty
impotence
crews
of
small
boats
and
tugs
all
jet
black
woolly
heads
and
very
muscular
winter
the
south
african
winter
is
just
beginning
now
but
nobody
but
an
expert
can
tell
it
from
summer
however
i
am
tired
of
summer
we
have
had
it
unbroken
for
eleven
months
we
spent
the
afternoon
on
shore
delagoa
bay
a
small
town
no
sights
no
carriages
three
but
we
could
get
them
apparently
private
these
portuguese
are
a
rich
brown
like
some
of
the
indians
some
of
the
blacks
have
the
long
horse
beads
and
very
long
chins
of
the
negroes
of
the
picture
books
but
most
of
them
are
exactly
like
the
negroes
of
our
southern
states
round
faces
flat
noses
and
easy
laughers
flocks
of
black
women
passed
along
carrying
outrageously
heavy
bags
of
freight
on
their
heads
the
quiver
of
their
leg
as
the
foot
was
planted
and
the
strain
exhibited
by
their
bodies
showed
what
a
tax
upon
their
strength
the
load
was
they
were
stevedores
and
doing
full
stevedores
work
they
were
very
erect
when
unladden
from
carrying
heavy
loads
on
their
heads
just
like
the
indian
women
it
gives
them
a
proud
fine
carriage
sometimes
one
saw
a
woman
carrying
on
her
head
a
laden
and
basket
the
shape
of
an
inverted
top
the
size
of
a
its
base
the
diameter
of
a
teacup
it
required
nice
balancing
and
got
it
no
bright
colors
yet
there
were
a
good
many
hindoos
the
second
class
passenger
came
over
as
usual
at
lights
out
and
we
lounged
along
the
spacious
vague
solitudes
of
the
deck
and
smoked
the
peaceful
pipe
and
talked
he
told
me
an
incident
in
barnum
life
which
was
evidently
characteristic
of
that
great
showman
in
several
ways
this
was
barnum
purchase
of
shakespeare
birthplace
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
the
second
class
passenger
was
in
jamrach
employ
at
the
time
and
knew
barnum
well
he
said
the
thing
began
in
this
way
one
morning
barnum
and
jamrach
were
in
jamrach
little
private
snuggery
back
of
the
wilderness
of
caged
monkeys
and
snakes
and
other
commonplaces
of
jamrach
stock
in
trade
refreshing
themselves
after
an
arduous
stroke
of
business
jamrach
with
something
orthodox
barnum
with
something
heterodox
for
barnum
was
a
teetotaler
the
stroke
of
business
was
in
the
elephant
line
jamrach
had
contracted
to
deliver
to
barnum
in
new
york
elephants
for
in
time
for
the
next
season
opening
then
it
occurred
to
barnum
that
he
needed
a
card
he
suggested
jumbo
jamrach
said
he
would
have
to
think
of
something
else
jumbo
could
be
had
the
zoo
would
part
with
that
elephant
barnum
said
he
was
willing
to
pay
a
fortune
for
jumbo
if
he
could
get
him
jamrach
said
it
was
no
use
to
think
about
it
that
jumbo
was
as
popular
as
the
prince
of
wales
and
the
zoo
would
dare
to
sell
him
all
england
would
be
outraged
at
the
idea
jumbo
was
an
english
institution
he
was
part
of
the
national
glory
one
might
as
well
think
of
buying
the
nelson
monument
barnum
spoke
up
with
vivacity
and
said
it
a
idea
i
buy
the
monument
jamrach
was
speechless
for
a
second
then
he
said
like
one
ashamed
you
caught
me
i
was
napping
for
a
moment
i
thought
you
were
in
earnest
barnum
said
pleasantly
i
was
in
earnest
i
know
they
wo
sell
it
but
no
matter
i
will
not
throw
away
a
good
idea
for
all
that
all
i
want
is
a
big
advertisement
i
will
keep
the
thing
in
mind
and
if
nothing
better
turns
up
i
will
offer
to
buy
it
that
will
answer
every
purpose
it
will
furnish
me
a
couple
of
columns
of
gratis
advertising
in
every
english
and
american
paper
for
a
couple
of
months
and
give
my
show
the
biggest
boom
a
show
ever
had
in
this
world
jamrach
started
to
deliver
a
burst
of
admiration
but
was
interrupted
by
barnum
who
said
here
is
a
state
of
things
england
ought
to
blush
his
eye
had
fallen
upon
something
in
the
newspaper
he
read
it
through
to
himself
then
read
it
aloud
it
said
that
the
house
that
shakespeare
was
born
in
at
was
falling
gradually
to
ruin
through
neglect
that
the
room
where
the
poet
first
saw
the
light
was
now
serving
as
a
butcher
shop
that
all
appeals
to
england
to
contribute
money
the
requisite
sum
stated
to
buy
and
repair
the
house
and
place
it
in
the
care
of
salaried
and
trustworthy
keepers
had
fallen
resultless
then
barnum
said
there
my
chance
let
jumbo
and
the
monument
alone
for
the
present
they
keep
i
buy
shakespeare
house
i
set
it
up
in
my
museum
in
new
york
and
put
a
glass
case
around
it
and
make
a
sacred
thing
of
it
and
you
see
all
america
flock
there
to
worship
yes
and
pilgrims
from
the
whole
earth
and
i
make
them
take
their
hats
off
too
in
america
we
know
how
to
value
anything
that
shakespeare
touch
has
made
holy
you
see
in
conclusion
the
said
that
is
the
way
the
thing
came
about
barnum
did
buy
house
he
paid
the
price
asked
and
received
the
properly
attested
documents
of
sale
then
there
was
an
explosion
i
can
tell
you
england
rose
that
the
birthplace
of
the
of
all
the
ages
and
all
the
climes
that
priceless
possession
of
britain
to
be
carted
out
of
the
country
like
so
much
old
lumber
and
set
up
for
sixpenny
desecration
in
a
yankee
the
idea
was
not
to
be
tolerated
for
a
moment
england
rose
in
her
indignation
and
barnum
was
glad
to
relinquish
his
prize
and
offer
apologies
however
he
stood
out
for
a
compromise
he
claimed
a
concession
england
must
let
him
have
jumbo
and
england
consented
but
not
cheerfully
it
shows
how
by
help
of
time
a
story
can
grow
even
after
barnum
has
had
the
first
innings
in
the
telling
of
it
barnum
told
me
the
story
himself
years
ago
he
said
that
the
permission
to
buy
jumbo
was
not
a
concession
the
purchase
was
made
and
the
animal
delivered
before
the
public
knew
anything
about
it
also
that
the
securing
of
jumbo
was
all
the
advertisement
he
needed
it
produced
many
columns
of
newspaper
talk
free
of
cost
and
he
was
satisfied
he
said
that
if
he
had
failed
to
get
jumbo
he
would
have
caused
his
notion
of
buying
the
nelson
monument
to
be
treacherously
smuggled
into
print
by
some
trusty
friend
and
after
he
had
gotten
a
few
hundred
pages
of
gratuitous
advertising
out
of
it
he
would
have
come
out
with
a
blundering
obtuse
but
letter
of
apology
and
in
a
postscript
to
it
would
have
naively
proposed
to
let
the
monument
go
and
take
stonehenge
in
place
of
it
at
the
same
price
it
was
his
opinion
that
such
a
letter
written
with
asinine
innocence
and
gush
would
have
gotten
his
ignorance
and
stupidity
an
amount
of
newspaper
abuse
worth
six
fortunes
to
him
and
not
purchasable
for
twice
the
money
i
knew
barnum
well
and
i
placed
every
confidence
in
the
account
which
he
gave
me
of
the
shakespeare
birthplace
episode
he
said
he
found
the
house
neglected
and
decay
and
he
inquired
into
the
matter
and
was
told
that
many
times
earnest
efforts
had
been
made
to
raise
money
for
its
proper
repair
and
preservation
but
without
success
he
then
proposed
to
buy
it
the
proposition
was
entertained
and
a
price
named
i
think
but
whatever
it
was
barnum
paid
the
money
down
without
remark
and
the
papers
were
drawn
up
and
executed
he
said
that
it
had
been
his
purpose
to
set
up
the
house
in
his
museum
keep
it
in
repair
protect
it
from
and
other
desecrators
and
leave
it
by
bequest
to
the
safe
and
perpetual
guardianship
of
the
smithsonian
institute
at
washington
but
as
soon
as
it
was
found
that
shakespeare
house
had
passed
into
foreign
hands
and
was
going
to
be
carried
across
the
ocean
england
was
stirred
as
no
appeal
from
the
custodians
of
the
relic
had
ever
stirred
england
before
and
protests
came
flowing
in
and
money
too
to
stop
the
outrage
offers
of
repurchase
were
made
offers
of
double
the
money
that
barnum
had
paid
for
the
house
he
handed
the
house
back
but
took
only
the
sum
which
it
had
cost
him
but
on
the
condition
that
an
endowment
sufficient
for
the
future
safeguarding
and
maintenance
of
the
sacred
relic
should
be
raised
this
condition
was
fulfilled
that
was
barnum
account
of
the
episode
and
to
the
end
of
his
days
he
claimed
with
pride
and
satisfaction
that
not
england
but
america
represented
by
him
saved
the
birthplace
of
shakespeare
from
destruction
at
may

and

when

comes
about
reaches
out
a
tongue
like

and
takes
him
in
he
gums
his

first
he
is
always
pious
in

and
pious
and

when

sends
him

he

project
from

then
if
something
happens
above

he
shoots
out

have

except
approaching

have
not
heard
anyone
call

the

but
that
is
what
it
probably
is
it
was
when
bishop
of
natal
that
colenso
raised
such
a
storm
in
the
religious
world
the
concerns
of
religion
are
a
vital
matter
here
yet
a
vigilant
eye
is
kept
upon
sunday
museums
and
other
dangerous
resorts
are
not
allowed
to
be
open
you
may
sail
on
the
bay
but
it
is
wicked
to
play
cricket
for
a
while
a
sunday
concert
was
tolerated
upon
condition
that
it
must
be
admission
free
and
the
money
taken
by
collection
but
the
collection
was
alarmingly
large
and
that
stopped
the
matter
they
are
particular
about
babies
a
clergyman
would
not
bury
a
child
according
to
the
sacred
rites
because
it
had
not
been
baptized
the
hindoo
is
more
liberal
he
burns
no
child
under

holding
that
it
does
not
need
purifying

about

there
is
a

trappist
monastery
two
hours
from
durban
over
the
country
roads
and
in
company
with
milligan
and
hunter
general
manager
of
the
natal
government
railways
who
knew
the
heads
of
it
we
went
out
to
see
it
there
it
all
was
just
as
one
reads
about
it
in
books
and
can
not
believe
that
it
is
so
i
mean
the
rough
hard
work
the
impossible
hours
the
scanty
food
the
coarse
raiment
the
maryborough
beds
the
tabu
of
human
speech
of
social
intercourse
of
relaxation
of
amusement
of
entertainment
of
the
presence
of
woman
in
the
men
establishment
there
it
all
was
it
was
not
a
dream
it
was
not
a
lie
and
yet
with
the
fact
before
one
face
it
was
still
incredible
it
is
such
a
sweeping
suppression
of
human
instincts
such
an
extinction
of
the
man
as
an
individual
la
trappe
must
have
known
the
human
race
well
the
scheme
which
he
invented
hunts
out
everything
that
a
man
wants
and
values
and
withholds
it
from
him
apparently
there
is
no
detail
that
can
help
make
life
worth
living
that
has
not
been
carefully
ascertained
and
placed
out
of
the
trappist
reach
la
trappe
must
have
known
that
there
were
men
who
would
enjoy
this
kind
of
misery
but
how
did
he
find
it
out
if
he
had
consulted
you
or
me
he
would
have
been
told
that
his
scheme
lacked
too
many
attractions
that
it
was
impossible
that
it
could
never
be
floated
but
there
in
the
monastery
was
proof
that
he
knew
the
human
race
better
than
it
knew
itself
he
set
his
foot
upon
every
desire
that
a
man
has
yet
he
floated
his
project
and
it
has
prospered
for
two
hundred
years
and
will
go
on
prospering
forever
no
doubt
man
likes
personal
distinction
there
in
the
monastery
it
is
obliterated
he
likes
delicious
food
there
he
gets
beans
and
bread
and
tea
and
not
enough
of
it
he
likes
to
lie
softly
there
he
lies
on
a
sand
mattress
and
has
a
pillow
and
a
blanket
but
no
sheet
when
he
is
dining
in
a
great
company
of
friends
he
likes
to
laugh
and
chat
there
a
monk
reads
a
holy
book
aloud
during
meals
and
nobody
speaks
or
laughs
when
a
man
has
a
hundred
friends
about
him
evenings
be
likes
to
have
a
good
time
and
run
late
there
he
and
the
rest
go
silently
to

in
the
dark
too
there
is
but
a
loose
brown

to
discard
there
are
no
to
put

not

man
likes
to
lie
abed

there
he
gets
up
once

in

night
to
perform

and
gets
up
finally

i
think
it

i
believe
that
the
disposition

not
shown
itself
tuesday

transvaal
politics
in
a
confused
condition
first
the
sentencing
of
the
johannesburg
reformers
startled
england
by
its
severity
on
the
top
of
this
came
kruger
exposure
of
the
cipher
correspondence
which
showed
that
the
invasion
of
the
transvaal
with
the
design
of
seizing
that
country
and
adding
it
to
the
british
empire
was
planned
by
cecil
rhodes
and
beit
which
made
a
revulsion
in
english
feeling
and
brought
out
a
storm
against
rhodes
and
the
chartered
company
for
degrading
british
honor
for
a
good
while
i
could
seem
to
get
at
a
clear
comprehension
of
it
it
was
so
tangled
but
at
last
by
patient
study
i
have
managed
it
i
believe
as
i
understand
it
the
uitlanders
and
other
dutchmen
were
dissatisfied
because
the
english
would
not
allow
them
to
take
any
part
in
the
government
except
to
pay
taxes
next
as
i
understand
it
kruger
and
jameson
not
having
been
able
to
make
the
medical
business
pay
made
a
raid
into
matabeleland
with
the
intention
of
capturing
the
capital
johannesburg
and
holding
the
women
and
children
to
ransom
until
the
uitlanders
and
the
other
boers
should
grant
to
them
and
the
chartered
company
the
political
rights
which
had
been
withheld
from
them
they
would
have
succeeded
in
this
great
scheme
as
i
understand
it
but
for
the
interference
of
cecil
rhodes
and
beit
and
other
chiefs
of
the
matabele
who
persuaded
their
countrymen
to
revolt
and
throw
off
their
allegiance
to
germany
this
in
turn
as
i
understand
it
provoked
the
king
of
abyssinia
to
destroy
the
italian
army
and
fall
back
upon
johannesburg

wilson
new
calendar
when
i
scribbled
in
my
a
year
ago
the
paragraph
which
ends
the
preceding
chapter
it
was
meant
to
indicate
in
an
extravagant
form
two
things
the
conflicting
nature
of
the
information
conveyed
by
the
citizen
to
the
stranger
concerning
south
african
politics
and
the
resulting
confusion
created
in
the
stranger
mind
thereby
but
it
does
not
seem
so
very
extravagant
now
nothing
could
in
that
disturbed
and
excited
time
make
south
african
politics
clear
or
quite
rational
to
the
citizen
of
the
country
because
his
personal
interest
and
his
political
prejudices
were
in
his
way
and
nothing
could
make
those
politics
clear
or
rational
to
the
stranger
the
sources
of
his
information
being
such
as
they
were
i
was
in
south
africa
some
little
time
when
i
arrived
there
the
political
pot
was
boiling
fiercely
four
months
previously
jameson
had
plunged
over
the
transvaal
border
with
about
armed
horsemen
at
his
back
to
go
to
the
relief
of
the
women
and
children
of
johannesburg
on
the
fourth
day
of
his
march
the
boers
had
defeated
him
in
battle
and
carried
him
and
his
men
to
pretoria
the
capital
as
prisoners
the
boer
government
had
turned
jameson
and
his
officers
over
to
the
british
government
for
trial
and
shipped
them
to
england
next
it
had
arrested
important
citizens
of
johannesburg
as
condemned
their
four
leaders
to
death
then
commuted
the
sentences
and
now
the
were
waiting
in
jail
for
further
results
before
midsummer
they
were
all
out
excepting
two
who
refused
to
sign
the
petitions
for
release
had
been
fined
each
and
enlarged
and
the
four
leaders
had
gotten
off
with
fines
of
each
with
permanent
exile
added
in
one
case
those
were
wonderfully
interesting
days
for
a
stranger
and
i
was
glad
to
be
in
the
thick
of
the
excitement
everybody
was
talking
and
i
expected
to
understand
the
whole
of
one
side
of
it
in
a
very
little
while
i
was
disappointed
there
were
singularities
perplexities
unaccountabilities
about
it
which
i
was
not
able
to
master
i
had
no
personal
access
to
boers
their
side
was
a
secret
to
me
aside
from
what
i
was
able
to
gather
of
it
from
published
statements
my
sympathies
were
soon
with
the
reformers
in
the
pretoria
jail
with
their
friends
and
with
their
cause
by
diligent
inquiry
in
johannesburg
i
found
out
apparently
all
the
details
of
their
side
of
the
quarrel
except
one
what
they
expected
to
accomplish
by
an
armed
rising
nobody
seemed
to
know
the
reason
why
the
reformers
were
discontented
and
wanted
some
changes
made
seemed
quite
clear
in
johannesburg
it
was
claimed
that
the
uitlanders
strangers
foreigners
paid
of
the
transvaal
taxes
yet
got
little
or
nothing
for
it
their
city
had
no
charter
it
had
no
municipal
government
it
could
levy
no
taxes
for
drainage
paving
cleaning
sanitation
policing
there
was
a
police
force
but
it
was
composed
of
boers
it
was
furnished
by
the
state
government
and
the
city
had
no
control
over
it
mining
was
very
costly
the
government
enormously
increased
the
cost
by
putting
burdensome
taxes
upon
the
mines
the
output
the
machinery
the
buildings
by
burdensome
imposts
upon
incoming
materials
by
burdensome
hardest
of
all
to
bear
the
government
reserved
to
itself
a
monopoly
in
that
essential
thing
dynamite
and
burdened
it
with
an
extravagant
price
the
detested
hollander
from
over
the
water
held
all
the
public
offices
the
government
was
rank
with
corruption
the
uitlander
had
no
vote
and
must
live
in
the
state
ten
or
twelve
years
before
he
could
get
one
he
was
not
represented
in
the
raad
legislature
that
oppressed
him
and
fleeced
him
religion
was
not
free
there
were
no
schools
where
the
teaching
was
in
english
yet
the
great
majority
of
the
white
population
of
the
state
knew
no
tongue
but
that
the
state
would
not
pass
a
liquor
law
but
allowed
a
great
trade
in
cheap
vile
brandy
among
the
blacks
with
the
result
that
per
cent
of
the
blacks
employed
in
the
mines
were
usually
drunk
and
incapable
of
working
there
it
was
plain
enough
that
the
reasons
for
wanting
some
changes
made
were
abundant
and
reasonable
if
this
statement
of
the
existing
grievances
was
correct
what
the
uitlanders
wanted
was
reform
under
the
existing
republic
what
they
proposed
to
do
was
to
secure
these
reforms
by
prayer
petition
and
persuasion
they
did
petition
also
they
issued
a
manifesto
whose
very
first
note
is
a
of
loyalty
we
want
the
establishment
of
this
republic
as
a
true
republic
could
anything
be
clearer
than
the
uitlander
statement
of
the
grievances
and
oppressions
under
which
they
were
suffering
could
anything
be
more
legal
and
and
than
their
attitude
as
expressed
by
their
manifesto
no
those
things
were
perfectly
clear
perfectly
comprehensible
but
at
this
point
the
puzzles
and
riddles
and
confusions
begin
to
flock
in
you
have
arrived
at
a
place
which
you
can
not
quite
understand
for
you
find
that
as
a
preparation
for
this
loyal
lawful
and
in
every
way
unexceptionable
attempt
to
persuade
the
government
to
right
their
grievances
the
uitlanders
had
smuggled
a
maxim
gun
or
two
and
muskets
into
the
town
concealed
in
oil
tanks
and
coal
cars
and
had
begun
to
form
and
drill
military
companies
composed
of
clerks
merchants
and
citizens
generally
what
was
their
idea
did
they
suppose
that
the
boers
would
attack
them
for
petitioning
for
redress
that
could
not
be
did
they
suppose
that
the
boers
would
attack
them
even
for
issuing
a
manifesto
demanding
relief
under
the
existing
government
yes
they
apparently
believed
so
because
the
air
was
full
of
talk
of
forcing
the
government
to
grant
redress
if
it
were
not
granted
peacefully
the
reformers
were
men
of
high
intelligence
if
they
were
in
earnest
they
were
taking
extraordinary
risks
they
had
enormously
valuable
properties
to
defend
their
town
was
full
of
women
and
children
their
mines
and
compounds
were
packed
with
thousands
upon
thousands
of
sturdy
blacks
if
the
boers
attacked
the
mines
would
close
the
blacks
would
swarm
out
and
get
drunk
riot
and
conflagration
and
the
boers
together
might
lose
the
reformers
more
in
a
day
in
money
blood
and
suffering
than
the
desired
political
relief
could
compensate
in
ten
years
if
they
won
the
fight
and
secured
the
reforms
it
is
may
now
a
year
has
gone
by
and
the
confusions
of
that
day
have
been
to
a
considerable
degree
cleared
away
cecil
rhodes
jameson
and
others
responsible
for
the
raid
have
testified
before
the
parliamentary
committee
of
inquiry
in
london
and
so
have
lionel
phillips
and
other
johannesburg
reformers
of
the
revolution
which
was
born
dead
these
testimonies
have
thrown
light
three
books

added
much
to
this
light
south

it
is
by

able

the

and
of

parliamentary
witnesses
and
stirring
the
whole
together
and
pouring
it
into
my
own
prejudiced
moulds
i
have
got
at
the
truth
of
that
puzzling
south
african
situation
which
is
this
the
capitalists
and
other
chief
men
of
johannesburg
were
fretting
under
various
political
and
financial
burdens
imposed
by
the
state
the
south
african
republic
sometimes
called
the
transvaal
and
desired
to
procure
by
peaceful
means
a
modification
of
the
laws
cecil

creator
and

and

projector
of

for

and

of
all
the
south
african
states
one
imposing
commonwealth
or
empire
under
the
shadow
and
general
protection
of
the
british
flag
thought
he
saw
an
opportunity
to
make
profitable
use
of
the
uitlander
discontent
above
mentioned
make
the
johannesburg
cat
help
pull
out
one
of
his
consolidation
chestnuts
for
him
with
this
view
he
set
himself
the
task
of
warming
the
lawful
and
legitimate
petitions
and
supplications
of
the
uitlanders
into
seditious
talk
and
their
frettings
into
threatenings
the
final
outcome
to
be
revolt
and
armed
rebellion
if
he
could
bring
about
a
bloody
collision
between
those
people
and
the
boer
government
great
britain
would
have
to
interfere
her
interference
would
be
resisted
by
the
boers
she
would
chastise
them
and
add
the
transvaal
to
her
south
african
possessions
it
was
not
a
foolish
idea
but
a
rational
and
practical
one
after
a
couple
of
years
of
judicious
plotting
rhodes
had
his
reward
the
revolutionary
kettle
was
briskly
boiling
in
johannesburg
and
the
uitlander
leaders
were
backing
their
appeals
to
the
government
now
hardened
into
demands
by
threats
of
force
and
bloodshed
by
the
middle
of
december
the
explosion
seemed
imminent
rhodes
was
diligently
helping
from
his
distant
post
in
cape
town
he
was
helping
to
procure
arms
for
johannesburg
he
was
also
arranging
to
have
jameson
break
over
the
border
and
come
to
johannesburg
with
mounted
men
at
his
back
jameson
as
per
instructions
from
rhodes
perhaps
wanted
a
letter
from
the
reformers
requesting
him
to
come
to
their
aid
it
was
a
good
idea
it
would
throw
a
considerable
share
of
the
responsibility
of
his
invasion
upon
the
reformers
he
got
the
letter
that
famous
one
urging
him
to
fly
to
the
rescue
of
the
women
and
children
he
got
it
two
months
before
he
flew
the
reformers
seem
to
have
thought
it
over
and
concluded
that
they
had
not
done
wisely
for
the
next
day
after
giving
jameson
the
implicating
document
they
wanted
to
withdraw
it
and
leave
the
women
and
children
in
danger
but
they
were
told
that
it
was
too
late
the
original
had
gone
to
rhodes
at
the
cape
jameson
had
kept
a
copy
though
from
that
time
until
the
of
december
a
good
deal
of
the
time
was
taken
up
with
energetic
efforts
to
keep
jameson
from
coming
to
their
assistance
jameson
invasion
had
been
set
for
the
the
reformers
were
not
ready
the
town
was
not
united
some
wanted
a
fight
some
wanted
peace
some
wanted
a
new
government
some
wanted
the
existing
one
reformed
apparently
very
few
wanted
the
revolution
to
take
place
in
the
interest
and
under
the
ultimate
shelter
of
the
imperial
flag
british
yet
a
report
began
to
spread
that
rhodes
embarrassing
assistance
had
for
its
end
this
latter
object
jameson
was
away
up
on
the
frontier
tugging
at
his
leash
fretting
to
burst
over
the
border
by
hard
work
the
reformers
got
his
postponed
a
little
and
wanted
to
get
it
postponed
eleven
days
apparently
rhodes
agents
were
seconding
their
efforts
in
fact
wearing
out
the
telegraph
wires
trying
to
hold
him
back
rhodes
was
himself
the
only
man
who
could
have
effectively
postponed
jameson
but
that
would
have
been
a
disadvantage
to
his
scheme
indeed
it
could
spoil
his
whole
two
years
work
jameson
endured
postponement
three
days
then
resolved
to
wait
no
longer
without
any
orders
excepting
rhodes
significant
silence
he
cut
the
telegraph
wires
on
the
and
made
his
plunge
that
night
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
the
women
and
children
by
urgent
request
of
a
letter
now
nine
days
old
as
per
date
a
couple
of
months
old
in
fact
he
read
the
letter
to
his
men
and
it
affected
them
it
did
not
affect
all
of
them
alike
some
saw
in
it
a
piece
of
piracy
of
doubtful
wisdom
and
were
sorry
to
find
that
they
had
been
assembled
to
violate
friendly
territory
instead
of
to
raid
native
kraals
as
they
had
supposed
jameson
would
have
to
ride
miles
he
knew
that
there
were
suspicions
abroad
in
the
transvaal
concerning
him
but
he
expected
to
get
through
to
johannesburg
before
they
should
become
general
and
obstructive
but
a
telegraph
wire
had
been
overlooked
and
not
cut
it
spread
the
news
of
his
invasion
far
and
wide
and
a
few
hours
after
his
start
the
boer
farmers
were
riding
hard
from
every
direction
to
intercept
him
as
soon
as
it
was
known
in
johannesburg
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
rescue
the
women
and
children
the
grateful
people
put
the
women
and
children
in
a
train
and
rushed
them
for
australia
in
fact
the
approach
of
johannesburg
saviour
created
panic
and
consternation
there
and
a
multitude
of
males
of
peaceable
disposition
swept
to
the
trains
like
a
the
early
ones
fared
best
they
secured
seats
by
sitting
in
them
eight
hours
before
the
first
train
was
timed
to
leave
rhodes
lost
no
time
he
cabled
the
renowned
johannesburg
letter
of
invitation
to
the
london
press
the
piece
of
ancient
history
that
ever
went
over
a
cable
the
new
poet
laureate
lost
no
time
he
came
out
with
a
rousing
poem
lauding
jameson
prompt
and
splendid
heroism
in
flying
to
the
rescue
of
the
women
and
children
for
the
poet
could
not
know
that
he
did
not
fly
until
two
months
after
the
invitation
he
was
deceived
by
the
false
date
of
the
letter
which
was
december
jameson
was
intercepted
by
the
boers
on
new
year
day
and
on
the
next
day
he
surrendered
he
had
carried
his
copy
of
the
letter
along
and
if
his
instructions
required
him
in
case
of
emergency
to
see
that
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
boers
he
loyally
carried
them
out
hammond
gives
him
a
sharp
rap
for
his
supposed
carelessness
and
emphasizes
her
feeling
about
it
with
burning
italics
it
was
picked
up
on
the
in
a
leathern
pouch
supposed
to
be
jameson
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
discreet
and
honorable
did
he
eat
it
she
requires
too
much
he
was
not
in
the
service
of
the
reformers
excepting
ostensibly
he
was
in
the
service
of
rhodes
it
was
the
only
plain
english
document
undarkened
by
ciphers
and
mysteries
and
responsibly
signed
and
authenticated
which
squarely
implicated
the
reformers
in
the
raid
and
it
was
not
to
rhodes
interest
that
it
should
be
eaten
besides
that
letter
was
not
the
original
it
was
only
a
copy
rhodes
had
the
original
and
did
eat
it
he
cabled
it
to
the
london
press
it
had
already
been
read
in
england
and
america
and
all
over
europe
before
jameson
dropped
it
on
the
battlefield
if
the
subordinate
knuckles
deserved
a
rap
the
principal
deserved
as
many
as
a
couple
of
them
that
letter
is
a
juicily
dramatic
incident
and
is
entitled
to
all
its
celebrity
because
of
the
odd
and
variegated
effects
which
it
produced
all
within
the
space
of
a
single
week
it
had
made
jameson
an
illustrious
hero
in
england
a
pirate
in
pretoria
and
an
ass
without
discretion
or
honor
in
johannesburg
also
it
had
produced
a
explosion
of
colored
fireworks
which
filled
the
world
sky
with
giddy
splendors
and
the
knowledge
that
jameson
was
coming
with
it
to
rescue
the
women
and
children
emptied
johannesburg
of
that
detail
of
the
population
for
an
old
letter
this
was
much
for
a
letter
two
months
old
it
did
marvels
if
it
had
been
a
year
old
it
would
have
done
miracles
chapter

wilson
new

those
latter
days
were
days
of
bitter
worry
and
trouble
for
the
harassed
reformers
from
hammond
we
learn
that
on
the
the
day
after
johannesburg
heard
of
the
invasion
the
reform
committee
repudiates
inroad
it
also
publishes
its
intention
to
adhere
to
the
manifesto
it
also
earnestly
desires
that
the
inhabitants
shall
refrain
from
overt
acts
against
the
boer
government
it
also
distributes
arms
at
the
court
house
and
furnishes
horses
to
the
volunteers
it
also
brings
a
transvaal
flag
into
the
and
the
entire
body
swear
allegiance
to
it
with
uncovered
heads
and
upraised
arms
also
one
thousand
rifles
have
been
given
out
to
rebels
also
in
a
speech
reformer
lionel
phillips
informs
the
public
that
the
reform
committee
delegation
has
been
received
with
courtesy
by
the
government
commission
and
been
assured
that
their
proposals
shall
be
earnestly
considered
that
while
the
reform
committee
regretted
jameson
precipitate
action
they
would
stand
by
him
also
the
populace
are
in
a
state
of
wild
enthusiasm
and
can
scarcely
be
restrained
they
want
to
go
out
to
meet
jameson
and
bring
him
in
with
triumphal
outcry
also
the
british
high
commissioner
has
issued
a
damnifying
proclamation
against
jameson
and
all
british
abettors
of
his
game
it
arrives
january
it
is
a
difficult
position
for
the
reformers
and
full
of
hindrances
and
perplexities
their
duty
is
hard
but
plain
they
have
to
repudiate
the
inroad
and
stand
by
the
inroader
they
have
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
boer
government
and
distribute
cavalry
horses
to
the
rebels
they
have
to
forbid
overt
acts
against
the
boer
government
and
distribute
arms
to
its
enemies
they
have
to
avoid
collision
with
the
british
government
but
still
stand
by
jameson
and
their
new
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
boer
government
taken
uncovered
in
presence
of
its
flag
they
did
such
of
these
things
as
they
could
they
tried
to
do
them
all
in
fact
did
do
them
all
but
only
in
turn
not
simultaneously
in
the
nature
of
things
they
could
not
be
made
to
simultane
in
preparing
for
armed
revolution
and
in
talking
revolution
were
the
reformers
bluffing
or
were
they
in
earnest
if
they
were
in
earnest
they
were
taking
great
risks
as
has
been
already
pointed
out
a
gentleman
of
high
position
told
me
in
johannesburg
that
he
had
in
his
possession
a
printed
document
proclaiming
a
new
government
and
naming
its
president
one
of
the
reform
leaders
he
said
that
this
proclamation
had
been
ready
for
issue
but
was
suppressed
when
the
raid
collapsed
perhaps
i
misunderstood
him
indeed
i
must
have
misunderstood
him
for
i
have
not
seen
mention
of
this
large
incident
in
print
anywhere
besides
i
hope
i
am
mistaken
for
if
i
am
then
there
is
argument
that
the
reformers
were
privately
not
serious
but
were
only
trying
to
scare
the
boer
government
into
granting
the
desired
reforms
the
boer
government
was
scared
and
it
had
a
right
to
be
for
if
rhodes
plan
was
to
provoke
a
collision
that
would
compel
the
interference
of
england
that
was
a
serious
matter
if
it
could
be
shown
that
that
was
also
the
reformers
plan
and
purpose
it
would
prove
that
they
had
marked
out
a
feasible
project
at
any
rate
although
it
was
one
which
could
hardly
fail
to
cost
them
ruinously
before
england
should
arrive
but
it
seems
clear
that
they
had
no
such
plan
nor
desire
if
when
the
worst
should
come
to
the
worst
they
meant
to
overthrow
the
government
they
also
meant
to
inherit
the
assets
themselves
no
doubt
this
scheme
could
hardly
have
succeeded
with
an
army
of
boers
at
their
gates
and
riotous
blacks
in
their
midst
the
odds
against
success
would
have
been
too
heavy
even
if
the
whole
town
had
been
armed
with
only
rifles
in
the
place
they
stood
really
no
chance
to
me
the
military
problems
of
the
situation
are
of
more
interest
than
the
political
ones
because
by
disposition
i
have
always
been
especially
fond
of
war
no
i
mean
fond
of
discussing
war
and
fond
of
giving
military
advice
if
i
had
been
with
jameson
the
morning
after
he
started
i
should
have
advised
him
to
turn
back
that
was
monday
it
was
then
that
he
received
his
first
warning
from
a
boer
source
not
to
violate
the
friendly
soil
of
the
transvaal
it
showed
that
his
invasion
was
known
if
i
had
been
with
him
on
tuesday
morning
and
afternoon
when
he
received
further
warnings
i
should
have
repeated
my
advice
if
i
had
been
with
him
the
next
morning
new
year
when
he
received
notice
that
a
few
hundred
boers
were
waiting
for
him
a
few
miles
ahead
i
should
not
have
advised
but
commanded
him
to
go
back
and
if
i
had
been
with
him
two
or
three
hours
later
a
thing
not
conceivable
to
me
i
should
have
retired
him
by
force
for
at
that
time
he
learned
that
the
few
hundred
had
now
grown
to
and
that
meant
that
the
growing
would
go
on
growing
for
by
authority
of
garrett
one
knows
that
jameson
were
only
at
most
when
you
count
out
his
native
drivers
etc
and
that
the
consisted
largely
of
green
youths
raw
young
fellows
not
trained
and
british
soldiers
and
i
would
have
told
jameson
that
those
lads
would
not
be
able
to
shoot
effectively
from
horseback
in
the
scamper
and
racket
of
battle
and
that
there
would
not
be
anything
for
them
to
shoot
at
anyway
but
rocks
for
the
boers
would
be
behind
the
rocks
not
out
in
the
open
i
would
have
told
him
that
boer
sharpshooters
behind
rocks
would
be
an
overmatch
for
his
raw
young
fellows
on
horseback
if
pluck
were
the
only
thing
essential
to
the
english
would
lose
no
battles
but
discretion
as
well
as
pluck
is
required
when
one
fights
boers
and
red
indians
in
south
africa
the
briton
has
always
insisted
upon
standing
bravely
up
unsheltered
before
the
hidden
boer
and
taking
the
results
jameson
men
would
follow
the
custom
jameson
would
not
have
listened
to
me
he
would
have
been
intent
upon
repeating
history
according
to
precedent
americans
are
not
acquainted
with
the
war
of
but
its
history
is
interesting
and
could
have
been
instructive
to
jameson
if
he
had
been
receptive
i
will
cull
some
details
of
it
from
trustworthy
sources
mainly
from
natal
russell
is
not
a
boer
but
a
briton
he
is
inspector
of
schools
and
his
history
is
a
whose
purpose
is
the
instruction
of
the
natal
english
youth
after
the
seizure
of
the
transvaal
and
the
suppression
of
the
boer
government
by
england
in
the
boers
fretted
for
three
years
and
made
several
appeals
to
england
for
a
restoration
of
their
liberties
but
without
result
then
they
gathered
themselves
together
in
a
great
at
krugersdorp
talked
their
troubles
over
and
resolved
to
fight
for
their
deliverance
from
the
british
yoke
krugersdorp
the
place
where
the
boers
interrupted
the
jameson
raid
the
little
handful
of
farmers
rose
against
the
strongest
empire
in
the
world
they
proclaimed
martial
law
and
the
of
their
republic
they
organized
their
forces
and
sent
them
forward
to
intercept
the
british
battalions
this
although
sir
garnet
wolseley
had
but
lately
made
proclamation
that
so
long
as
the
sun
shone
in
the
heavens
the
transvaal
would
be
and
remain
english
territory
and
also
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
commander
of
the
regiment
already
on
the
march
to
suppress
this
rebellion
had
been
heard
to
say
that

discovered
that

were
flanking

position
the
next
morning
he
left
his
camp
at

pleasant
and
marched
out
and
crossed
the
ingogo
river
with
men
started
up
the
ingogo
heights
and
there
fought
a
battle
which
lasted
from
noon
till
nightfall
he
then
retreated
leaving
his
wounded
with
his
military
chaplain
and
in
recrossing
the
now
swollen
river
lost
some
of
his
men
by
drowning
that
was
the
third
boer
victory
result
according
to
russell
british
loss
out
of
engaged
boer
loss
killed
wounded
there
was
a
season
of
quiet
now
but
at
the
end
of
about
three
weeks
sir
george
colley
conceived
the
idea
of
climbing
with
an
infantry
and
artillery
force
the
steep
and
rugged
mountain
of
amajuba
in
the
night
a
bitter
hard
task
but
he
accomplished
it
on
the
way
he
left
about
men
to
guard
a
strategic
point
and
took
about
up
the
mountain
with
him
when
the
sun
rose
in
the
morning
there
was
an
unpleasant
surprise
for
the
boers
yonder
were
the
english
troops
visible
on
top
of
the
mountain
two
or
three
miles
away
and
now
their
own
position
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
english
artillery
the
boer
chief
resolved
to
retreat
up
that
mountain
he
asked
for
volunteers
and
got
them
the
storming
party
crossed
the
swale
and
began
to
creep
up
the
steeps
and
from
behind
rocks
and
bushes
they
shot
at
the
soldiers
on
the
skyline
as
if
they
were
stalking
deer
says
russell
there
was
continuous
musketry
fire
steady
and
fatal
on
the
one
side
wild
and
ineffectual
on
the
other
the
boers
reached
the
top
and
began
to
put
in
their
ruinous
work
presently
the
british
broke
and
fled
for
their
lives
down
the
rugged
steep
the
boers
had
won
the
battle
result
in
killed
and
wounded
including
among
the
killed
the
british
general
british
loss
out
of
engaged
boer
loss
killed
wounded
that
ended
the
war
england
listened
to
reason
and
recognized
the
boer
republic
a
government
which
has
never
been
in
any
really
awful
danger
since
until
jameson
started
after
it
with
his
raw
young
fellows
to
recapitulate
the
boer
farmers
and
british
soldiers
fought
battles
and
the
boers
won
them
all
result
of
the
in
killed
and
wounded
british
loss
men
boer
loss
so
far
as
known
men
it
is
interesting
now
to
note
how
loyally
jameson
and
his
several
trained
british
military
officers
tried
to
make
their
battles
conform
to
precedent
garrett
account
of
the
raid
is
much
the
best
one
i
have
met
with
and
my
impressions
of
the
raid
are
drawn
from
that
when
jameson
learned
that
near
krugersdorp
he
would
find
boers
waiting
to
dispute
his
passage
he
was
not
in
the
least
disturbed
he
was
feeling
as
he
had
felt
two
or
three
days
before
when
he
had
opened
his
campaign
with
a
historic
remark
to
the
same
purport
as
the
one
with
which
the
commander
of
the
had
opened
the
war
of
fourteen
years
before
that
commander
remark
was
that
the
boers
would
turn
tail
at
the
first
beat
of
the
big
drum
jameson
was
that
with
his
raw
young
fellows
he
could
kick
the
persons
of
the
boers
all
round
the
transvaal
he
was
keeping
close
to
historic
precedent
jameson
arrived
in
the
presence
of
the
boers
they
according
to
precedent
were
not
visible
it
was
a
country
of
ridges
depressions
rocks
ditches
moraines
of
not
even
as
favorable
for
cavalry
work
as
laing
nek
had
been
in
the
former
disastrous
days
jameson
shot
at
the
ridges
and
rocks
with
his
artillery
just
as
general
colley
had
done
at
the
nek
and
did
them
no
damage
and
persuaded
no
boer
to
show
himself
then
about
a
hundred
of
his
men
formed
up
to
charge
the
to
the
precedent
at
the
nek
but
as
they
dashed
forward
they
opened
out
in
a
long
line
which
was
a
considerable
improvement
on
the
tactics
when
they
had
gotten
to
within
yards
of
the
ridge
the
concealed
boers
opened
out
on
them
and
emptied
saddles
the
unwounded
dismounted
and
fired
at
the
rocks
over
the
backs
of
their
horses
but
the
was
too
hot
and
they
mounted
again
and
galloped
back
or
crawled
away
into
a
clump
of
reeds
for
cover
where
they
were
shortly
afterward
taken
prisoners
as
they
lay
among
the
reeds
some
thirty
prisoners
were
so
taken
and
during
the
night
which
followed
the
boers
carried
away
another
thirty
killed
and
wounded
the
wounded
to
krugersdorp
hospital
sixty
per
cent
of
the
assaulted
force
disposed
of
according
to
garrett
estimate
it
was
according
to
amajuba
precedent
where
the
british
loss
was
out
of
about
engaged
also
in
jameson
camp
that
night
there
lay
about
wounded
or
otherwise
disabled
men
also
during
the
night
some
or
young
fellows
got
separated
from
the
command
and
straggled
through
into
johannesburg
altogether
a
possible
men
gone
out
of
his
his
lads
had
fought
valorously
but
had
not
been
able
to
get
near
enough
to
a
boer
to
kick
him
around
the
transvaal
at
dawn
the
next
morning
the
column
of
something
short
of
whites
resumed
its
march
jameson
grit
was
stubbornly
good
indeed
it
was
always
that
he
still
had
hopes
there
was
a
long
and
tedious
zigzagging
march
through
broken
ground
with
constant
harassment
from
the
boers
and
at
last
the
column
walked
into
a
sort
of
trap
and
the
boers
closed
in
upon
it
men
and
horses
dropped
on
all
sides
in
the
column
the
feeling
grew
that
unless
it
could
burst
through
the
boer
lines
at
this
point
it
was
done
for
the
maxims
were
fired
until
they
grew
too
hot
and
water
failing
for
the
cool
jacket
five
of
them
jammed
and
went
out
of
action
the
was
fired
until
only
half
an
ammunition
was
left
to
fire
with
one
last
rush
was
made
and
failed
and
then
the
staats
artillery
came
up
on
the
left
flank
and
the
game
was
up
jameson
hoisted
a
white
flag
and
surrendered
there
is
a
story
which
may
not
be
true
about
an
ignorant
boer
farmer
there
who
thought
that
this
white
flag
was
the
national
flag
of
england
he
had
been
at
bronkhorst
and
laing
nek
and
ingogo
and
amajuba
and
supposed
that
the
english
did
not
run
up
their
flag
excepting
at
the
end
of
a
fight
the
following
is
as
i
understand
it
garrett
estimate
of
total
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
for
the
two
days
when
they
gave
in
they
were
minus
some
per
cent
of
combatants
there
were
casualties
there
were
men
hurt
or
sick
in
the
wagons
there
were
killed
on
the
spot
or
mortally
wounded
total
out
of
the
original
it
is
just
per
however
i
judge
that
the
total
was
really
for
the
number
of
wounded
carried
to
krugersdorp
hospital
was
not
as
garrett
reports
it
the
lady
whose
guest
i
was
in
krugerdorp
gave
me
the
figures
she
was
head
nurse
from
the
beginning
of
hostilities
until
the
professional
nurses
arrived
of
the
three
or
four
were
boers
i
quote
her
words
this
is
a
large
improvement
upon
the
precedents
established
at
bronkhorst
laing
nek
ingogo
and
amajuba
and
seems
to
indicate
that
boer
marksmanship
is
not
so
good
now
as
it
was
in
those
days
but
there
is
one
detail
in
which
the
exactly
repeats
history
by
surrender
at
bronkhorst
the
whole
british
force
disappeared
from
the
theater
of
war
this
was
the
case
with
jameson
force
in
the
boer
loss
also
historical
precedent
is
followed
with
sufficient
fidelity
in
the
battles
named
above
the
boer
loss
so
far
as
known
was
an
average
of
men
per
battle
to
the
british
average
loss
of
in
jameson
battles
as
per
boer
official
report
the
boer
loss
in
killed
was
two
of
these
were
killed
by
the
boers
themselves
by
accident
the
other
by
jameson
army
one
of
them
intentionally
the
other
by
a
pathetic
mischance
a
young
boer
named
jacobz
was
moving
forward
to
give
a
drink
to
one
of
the
wounded
troopers
jameson
after
the
first
charge
when
another
wounded
man
mistaking
his
intention
shot
him
there
were
three
or
four
wounded
boers
in
the
krugersdorp
hospital
and
apparently
no
others
have
been
reported
garrett
on
a
balance
of
probabilities
fully
accepts
the
official
version
and
thanks
heaven
the
killed
was
not
larger
as
a
military
man
i
wish
to
point
out
what
seems
to
me
to
be
military
errors
in
the
conduct
of
the
campaign
which
we
have
just
been
considering
i
have
seen
active
service
in
the
field
and
it
was
in
the
actualities
of
war
that
i
acquired
my
training
and
my
right
to
speak
i
served
two
weeks
in
the
beginning
of
our
civil
war
and
during
all
that
tune
commanded
a
battery
of
infantry
composed
of
twelve
men
general
grant
knew
the
history
of
my
campaign
for
i
told
it
him
i
also
told
him
the
principle
upon
which
i
had
conducted
it
which
was
to
tire
the
enemy
i
tired
out
and
disqualified
many
battalions
yet
never
had
a
casualty
myself
nor
lost
a
man
general
grant
was
not
given
to
paying
compliments
yet
he
said
frankly
that
if
i
had
conducted
the
whole
war
much
bloodshed
would
have
been
spared
and
that
what
the
army
might
have
lost
through
the
inspiriting
results
of
collision
in
the
field
would
have
been
amply
made
up
by
the
liberalizing
influences
of
travel
further
endorsement
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
necessary
let
us
now
examine
history
and
see
what
it
teaches
in
the
battles
fought
in
and
the
two
fought
by
jameson
the
british
loss
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
was
substantially
men
the
boer
loss
as
far
as
is
ascertainable
eras
about
men
these
figures
show
that
there
was
a
defect
somewhere
it
was
not
in
the
absence
of
courage
i
think
it
lay
in
the
absence
of
discretion
the
briton
should
have
done
one
thing
or
the
other
discarded
british
methods
and
fought
the
boer
with
boer
methods
or
augmented
his
own
force
until
using
british
methods
it
should
be
large
enough
to
equalize
results
with
the
boer
to
retain
the
british
method
requires
certain
things
determinable
by
arithmetic
if
for
argument
sake
we
allow
that
the
aggregate
of
british
soldiers
engaged
in
the
early
battles
was
opposed
by
the
same
aggregate
of
boers
we
have
this
result
the
british
loss
of
and
the
boer
loss
of
argues
that
in
order
to
equalize
results
in
future
battles
you
must
make
the
british
force
thirty
times
as
strong
as
the
boer
force
garrett
shows
that
the
boer
force
immediately
opposed
to
jameson
was
and
that
there
were
more
on
hand
by
the
evening
of
the
second
day
arithmetic
shows
that
in
order
to
make
himself
the
equal
of
the
boers
jameson
should
have
had
men
whereas
he
merely
had
boys
from
a
military
point
of
view
backed
by
the
facts
of
history
i
conceive
that
jameson
military
judgment
was
at
fault
another
jameson
was
encumbered
by
artillery
ammunition
and
rifles
the
facts
of
the
battle
show
that
he
should
have
had
none
of
those
things
along
they
were
heavy
they
were
in
his
way
they
impeded
his
march
there
was
nothing
to
shoot
at
but
rocks
he
knew
quite
well
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
shoot
at
but
rocks
and
he
knew
that
artillery
and
rifles
have
no
effect
upon
rocks
he
was
badly
overloaded
with
unessentials
he
had
maxims
a
maxim
is
a
kind
of
gatling
i
believe
and
shoots
about
bullets
per
minute
he
had
one
cannon
and
two
also
rounds
of
ammunition
he
worked
the
maxims
so
hard
upon
the
rocks
that
five
of
them
became
disabled
five
of
the
maxims
not
the
rocks
it
is
believed
that
upwards
of
rounds
of
ammunition
of
the
various
kinds
were
fired
during
the
hours
that
the
battles
lasted
one
man
killed
he
must
have
been
much
mutilated
it
was
a
pity
to
bring
those
futile
maxims
along
jameson
should
have
furnished
himself
with
a
battery
of
wilson
maxims
instead
they
are
much
more
deadly
than
those
others
and
they
are
easily
carried
because
they
have
no
weight
garrett
not
very
carefully
concealing
a
smile
excuses
the
presence
of
the
maxims
by
saying
that
they
were
of
very
substantial
use
because
their
sputtering
disordered
the
aim
of
the
boers
and
in
that
way
saved
lives
three
cannon
eight
maxims
and
five
hundred
rifles
yielded
a
result
which
emphasized
a
fact
which
had
already
been
established
that
the
british
system
of
standing
out
in
the
open
to
fight
boers
who
are
behind
rocks
is
not
wise
not
excusable
and
ought
to
be
abandoned
for
something
more
efficacious
for
the
purpose
of
war
is
to
kill
not
merely
to
waste
ammunition
if
i
could
get
the
management
of
one
of
those
campaigns
i
would
know
what
to
do
for
i
have
studied
the
boer
he
values
the
bible
above
every
other
thing
the
most
delicious
edible
in
south
africa
is
biltong
you
will
have
seen
it
mentioned
in
olive
schreiner
books
it
is
what
our
plainsmen
call
jerked
beef
it
is
the
boer
main
standby
he
has
a
passion
for
it
and
he
is
right
if
i
had
the
command
of
the
campaign
i
would
go
with
rifles
only
no
cumbersome
maxims
and
cannon
to
spoil
good
rocks
with
i
would
move
surreptitiously
by
night
to
a
point
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
boer
camp
and
there
i
would
build
up
a
pyramid
of
biltong
and
bibles
fifty
feet
high
and
then
conceal
my
men
all
about
in
the
morning
the
boers
would
send
out
spies
and
then
the
rest
would
come
with
a
rush
i
would
surround
them
and
they
would
have
to
fight
my
men
on
equal
terms
in
the
open
there
would
be
any
amajuba
results
just
as
i
am
finishing
this
book
an
unfortunate
dispute
has
sprung
up
between
jameson
and
his
officers
on
the
one
hand
and
colonel
rhodes
on
the
other
concerning
the
wording
of
a
note
which
colonel
rhodes
sent
from
johannesburg
by
a
cyclist
to
jameson
just
before
hostilities
began
on
the
memorable
new
year
day
some
of
the
fragments
of
this
note
were
found
on
the
battlefield
after
the
fight
and
these
have
been
pieced
together
the
dispute
is
as
to
what
words
the
lacking
fragments
contained
jameson
says
the
note
promised
him
a
reinforcement
of
men
from
johannesburg
colonel
rhodes
denies
this
and
says
he
merely
promised
to
send
out
some
men
to
meet
you
it
seems
a
pity
that
these
friends
should
fall
out
over
so
little
a
thing
if
the
had
been
sent
what
good
would
it
have
done
in
hours
of
industrious
fighting
jameson
men
with
maxims
cannon
and
rounds
of
ammunition
killed
an
aggregate
of
boer
these
statistics
show
that
a
reinforcement
of
johannesburgers
armed
merely
with
muskets
would
have
killed
at
the
outside
only
a
little
over
a
half
of
another
boer
this
would
not
have
saved
the
day
it
would
not
even
have
seriously
affected
the
general
result
the
figures
show
clearly
and
with
mathematical
violence
that
the
only
way
to
save
jameson
or
even
give
him
a
fair
and
equal
chance
with
the
enemy
was
for
johannesburg
to
send
him
maxims
cannon
carloads
of
ammunition
and
men
johannesburg
was
not
in
a
position
to
do
this
johannesburg
has
been
called
very
hard
names
for
not
reinforcing
jameson
but
in
every
instance
this
has
been
done
by
two
classes
of
persons
people
who
do
not
read
history
and
people
like
jameson
who
do
not
understand
what
it
means
after
they
have
read
it
chapter
lxviii
none
of
us
can
have
as
many
virtues
as
the
or
half
its
cussedness
but
we
can
try
wilson
new
calendar
the
duke
of
fife
has
borne
testimony
that
rhodes
deceived
him
that
is
also
what
rhodes
did
with
the
reformers
he
got
them
into
trouble
and
then
stayed
out
himself
a
judicious
man
he
has
always
been
that
as
to
this
there
was
a
moment
of
doubt
once
it
was
when
he
was
out
on
his
last
pirating
expedition
in
the
matabele
country
the
cable
shouted
out
that
he
had
gone
unarmed
to
visit
a
party
of
hostile
chiefs
it
was
true
too
and
this
thing
came
near
fetching
another
indiscretion
out
of
the
poet
laureate
it
would
have
been
too
bad
for
when
the
facts
were
all
in
it
turned
out
that
there
was
a
lady
along
too
and
she
also
was
unarmed
in
the
opinion
of
many
people
rhodes
is
south
africa
others
think
he
is
only
a
large
part
of
it
these
latter
consider
that
south
africa
consists
of
table
mountain
the
diamond
mines
the
johannesburg
gold
fields
and
cecil
rhodes
the
gold
fields
are
wonderful
in
every
way
in
seven
or
eight
years
they
built
up
in
a
desert
a
city
of
a
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
counting
white
and
black
together
and
not
the
ordinary
mining
city
of
wooden
shanties
but
a
city
made
out
of
lasting
material
nowhere
in
the
world
is
there
such
a
concentration
of
rich
mines
as
at
johannesburg
bonamici
my
manager
there
gave
me
a
small
gold
brick
with
some
statistics
engraved
upon
it
which
record
the
output
of
gold
from
the
early
days
to
july
and
exhibit
the
strides
which
have
been
made
in
the
development
of
the
industry
in
the
output
was
the
output
of
the
next
five
and
a
half
years
was
total
for
the
single
year
ending
with
june
it
was
the
capital
which
has
developed
the
mines
came
from
england
the
mining
engineers
from
america
this
is
the
case
with
the
diamond
mines
also
south
africa
seems
to
be
the
heaven
of
the
american
scientific
mining
engineer
he
gets
the
choicest
places
and
keeps
them
his
salary
is
not
based
upon
what
he
would
get
in
america
but
apparently
upon
what
a
whole
family
of
him
would
get
there
the
successful
mines
pay
great
dividends
yet
the
rock
is
not
rich
from
a
californian
point
of
view
rock
which
yields
ten
or
twelve
dollars
a
ton
is
considered
plenty
rich
enough
it
is
troubled
with
base
metals
to
such
a
degree
that
twenty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
only
about
half
as
valuable
as
it
is
now
for
at
that
time
there
was
no
paying
way
of
getting
anything
out
of
such
rock
but
the
free
gold
but
the
new
cyanide
process
has
changed
all
that
and
the
gold
fields
of
the
world
now
deliver
up
fifty
million
dollars
worth
of
gold
per
year
which
would
have
gone
into
the
under
the
former
conditions
the
cyanide
process
was
new
to
me
and
full
of
interest
and
among
the
costly
and
elaborate
mining
machinery
there
were
fine
things
which
were
new
to
me
but
i
was
already
familiar
with
the
rest
of
the
details
of
the
industry
i
had
been
a
gold
miner
myself
in
my
day
and
knew
substantially
everything
that
those
people
knew
about
it
except
how
to
make
money
at
it
but
i
learned
a
good
deal
about
the
boers
there
and
that
was
a
fresh
subject
what
i
heard
there
was
afterwards
repeated
to
me
in
other
parts
of
south
africa
summed
up
according
to
the
information
thus
gained
this
is
the
boer
he
is
deeply
religious
profoundly
ignorant
dull
obstinate
bigoted
uncleanly
in
his
habits
hospitable
honest
in
his
dealings
with
the
whites
a
hard
master
to
his
black
servant
lazy
a
good
shot
good
horseman
addicted
to
the
chase
a
lover
of
political
independence
a
good
husband
and
father
not
fond
of
herding
together
in
towns
but
liking
the
seclusion
and
remoteness
and
solitude
and
empty
vastness
and
silence
of
the
veldt
a
man
of
a
mighty
appetite
and
not
delicate
about
what
he
appeases
it
with
with
pork
and
indian
corn
and
biltong
requiring
only
that
the
quantity
shall
not
be
stinted
willing
to
ride
a
long
journey
to
take
a
hand
in
a
rude
dance
interspersed
with
vigorous
feeding
and
boisterous
jollity
but
ready
to
ride
twice
as
far
for
a
proud
of
his
dutch
and
huguenot
origin
and
its
religious
and
military
history
proud
of
his
achievements
in
south
africa
its
bold
plunges
into
hostile
and
uncharted
deserts
in
search
of
free
solitudes
unvexed
by
the
pestering
and
detested
english
also
its
victories
over
the
natives
and
the
british
proudest
of
all
of
the
direct
and
effusive
personal
interest
which
the
deity
has
always
taken
in
its
affairs
he
can
not
read
he
can
not
write
he
has
one
or
two
newspapers
but
he
is
apparently
not
aware
of
it
until
latterly
he
had
no
schools
and
taught
his
children
nothing
news
is
a
term
which
has
no
meaning
to
him
and
the
thing
itself
he
cares
nothing
about
he
hates
to
be
taxed
and
resents
it
he
has
stood
stock
still
in
south
africa
for
two
centuries
and
a
half
and
would
like
to
stand
still
till
the
end
of
time
for
he
has
no
sympathy
with
uitlander
notions
of
progress
he
is
hungry
to
be
rich
for
he
is
human
but
his
preference
has
been
for
riches
in
cattle
not
in
fine
clothes
and
fine
houses
and
gold
and
diamonds
the
gold
and
the
diamonds
have
brought
the
godless
stranger
within
his
gates
also
contamination
and
broken
repose
and
he
wishes
that
they
had
never
been
discovered
i
think
that
the
bulk
of
those
details
can
be
found
in
olive
books
and
she
would
not
be
accused
of
sketching
the
boer
portrait
with
an
unfair
hand
now
what
would
you
expect
from
that
unpromising
material
what
ought
you
to
expect
from
it
laws
inimical
to
religious
liberty
yes
laws
denying
representation
and
suffrage
to
the
intruder
yes
laws
unfriendly
to
educational
institutions
yes
laws
obstructive
of
gold
production
yes
discouragement
of
railway
expansion
yes
laws
heavily
taxing
the
intruder
and
overlooking
the
boer
yes
the
uitlander
seems
to
have
expected
something
very
different
from
all
that
i
do
not
know
why
nothing
different
from
it
was
rationally
to
be
expected
a
round
man
can
not
be
expected
to
fit
a
square
hole
right
away
he
must
have
time
to
modify
his
shape
the
modification
had
begun
in
a
detail
or
two
before
the
raid
and
was
making
some
progress
it
has
made
further
progress
since
there
are
wise
men
in
the
boer
government
and
that
accounts
for
the
modification
the
modification
of
the
boer
mass
has
probably
not
begun
yet
if
the
heads
of
the
boer
government
had
not
been
wise
men
they
would
have
hanged
jameson
and
thus
turned
a
very
commonplace
pirate
into
a
holy
martyr
but
even
their
wisdom
has
its
limits
and
they
will
hang
rhodes
if
they
ever
catch
him
that
will
round
him
and
complete
him
and
make
him
a
saint
he
has
already
been
called
by
all
other
titles
that
symbolize
human
grandeur
and
he
ought
to
rise
to
this
one
the
grandest
of
all
it
will
be
a
dizzy
jump
from
where
he
is
now
but
that
is
nothing
it
will
land
him
in
good
company
and
be
a
pleasant
change
for
him
some
of
the
things
demanded
by
the
johannesburgers
manifesto
have
been
conceded
since
the
days
of
the
raid
and
the
others
will
follow
in
time
no
doubt
it
was
most
fortunate
for
the
miners
of
johannesburg
that
the
taxes
which
distressed
them
so
much
were
levied
by
the
boer
government
instead
of
by
their
friend
rhodes
and
his
chartered
company
of
highwaymen
for
these
latter
take
half
of
whatever
their
mining
victims
find
they
do
not
stop
at
a
mere
percentage
if
the
johannesburg
miners
were
under
their
jurisdiction
they
would
be
in
the
poorhouse
in
twelve
months
i
have
been
under
the
impression
all
along
that
i
had
an
unpleasant
paragraph
about
the
boers
somewhere
in
my
notebook
and
also
a
pleasant
one
i
have
found
them
now
the
unpleasant
one
is
dated
at
an
interior
village
and
says
called
he
is
an
english
afrikander
is
an
old
resident
and
has
a
boer
wife
he
speaks
the
language
and
his
professional
business
is
with
the
boers
exclusively
he
told
me
that
the
ancient
boer
families
in
the
great
region
of
which
this
village
is
the
commercial
center
are
falling
victims
to
their
inherited
indolence
and
dullness
in
the
materialistic
race
and
struggle
and
are
dropping
one
by
one
into
the
grip
of
the
usurer
getting
hopelessly
in
debt
and
are
losing
their
high
place
and
retiring
to
second
and
lower
the
boer
farm
does
not
go
to
another
boer
when
he
loses
it
but
to
a
foreigner
some
have
fallen
so
low
that
they
sell
their
daughters
to
the
blacks
under
date
of
another
south
african
town
i
find
the
note
which
is
creditable
to
the
boers
told
me
that
in
the
kafir
war
kafirs
took
refuge
in
a
great
cave
in
the
mountains
about
miles
north
of
johannesburg
and
the
boers
blocked
up
the
entrance
and
smoked
them
to
death
has
been
in
there
and
seen
the
great
array
of
bleached
skeletons
one
a
woman
with
the
skeleton
of
a
child
hugged
to
her
breast
the
great
bulk
of
the
savages
must
go
the
white
man
wants
their
lands
and
all
must
go
excepting
such
percentage
of
them
as
he
will
need
to
do
his
work
for
him
upon
terms
to
be
determined
by
himself
since
history
has
removed
the
element
of
guesswork
from
this
matter
and
made
it
certainty
the
humanest
way
of
diminishing
the
black
population
should
be
adopted
not
the
old
cruel
ways
of
the
past
rhodes
and
his
gang
have
been
following
the
old
they
are
chartered
to
rob
and
slay
and
they
lawfully
do
it
but
not
in
a
compassionate
and
christian
spirit
they
rob
the
mashonas
and
the
matabeles
of
a
portion
of
their
territories
in
the
hallowed
old
style
of
purchase
for
a
song
and
then
they
force
a
quarrel
and
take
the
rest
by
the
strong
hand
they
rob
the
natives
of
their
cattle
under
the
pretext
that
all
the
cattle
in
the
country
belonged
to
the
king
whom
they
have
tricked
and
assassinated
they
issue
regulations
requiring
the
incensed
and
harassed
natives
to
work
for
the
white
settlers
and
neglect
their
own
affairs
to
do
it
this
is
slavery
and
is
several
times
worse
than
was
the
american
slavery
which
used
to
pain
england
so
much
for
when
this
rhodesian
slave
is
sick
or
otherwise
disabled
he
must
support
himself
or
starve
his
master
is
under
no
obligation
to
support
him
the
reduction
of
the
population
by
rhodesian
methods
to
the
desired
limit
is
a
return
to
the
and
system
of
a
discredited
time
and
a
crude
civilization
we
humanely
reduce
an
overplus
of
dogs
by
swift
chloroform
the
boer
humanely
reduced
an
overplus
of
blacks
by
swift
suffocation
the
nameless
but
australian
pioneer
humanely
reduced
his
overplus
of
aboriginal
neighbors
by
a
sweetened
swift
death
concealed
in
a
poisoned
pudding
all
these
are
admirable
and
worthy
of
praise
you
and
i
would
rather
suffer
either
of
these
deaths
thirty
times
over
in
thirty
successive
days
than
linger
out
one
of
the
rhodesian
deaths
with
its
daily
burden
of
insult
humiliation
and
forced
labor
for
a
man
whose
entire
race
the
victim
hates
rhodesia
is
a
happy
name
for
that
land
of
piracy
and
pillage
and
puts
the
right
stain
upon
it
several
long
journeys
gave
us
experience
of
the
cape
colony
railways
fine
cars
all
the
conveniences
thorough
cleanliness
comfortable
beds
furnished
for
the
night
trains
it
was
in
the
first
days
of
june
and
winter
the
daytime
was
pleasant
the
nighttime
nice
and
cold
spinning
along
all
day
in
the
cars
it
was
ecstasy
to
breathe
the
bracing
air
and
gaze
out
over
the
vast
brown
solitudes
of
the
velvet
plains
soft
and
lovely
near
by
still
softer
and
lovelier
further
away
softest
and
loveliest
of
all
in
the
remote
distances
where
dim
seemed
afloat
as
in
a
sea
a
sea
made
of
and
flushed
with
colors
faint
and
rich
and
dear
me
the
depth
of
the
sky
and
the
beauty
of
the
strange
new
and
the
glory
of
the
sunshine
the
lavishness
the
wastefulness
of
it
the
vigor
and
freshness
and
inspiration
of
the
air
and
the
sunwell
it
was
all
just
as
olive
schreiner
had
made
it
in
her
books
to
me
the
veldt
in
its
sober
winter
garb
was
surpassingly
beautiful
there
were
unlevel
stretches
where
it
was
rolling
and
swelling
and
rising
and
subsiding
and
sweeping
superbly
on
and
on
and
still
on
and
on
like
an
ocean
toward
the
faraway
horizon
its
pale
brown
deepening
by
delicately
graduated
shades
to
rich
orange
and
finally
to
purple
and
crimson
where
it
washed
against
the
wooded
hills
and
naked
red
crags
at
the
base
of
the
sky
everywhere
from
cape
town
to
kimberley
and
from
kimberley
to
port
elizabeth
and
east
london
the
towns
were
well
populated
with
tamed
blacks
tamed
and
christianized
too
i
suppose
for
they
wore
the
dowdy
clothes
of
our
christian
civilization
but
for
that
many
of
them
would
have
been
remarkably
handsome
these
fiendish
clothes
together
with
the
proper
lounging
gait
face
happy
air
and
easy
laugh
made
them
precise
counterparts
of
our
american
blacks
often
where
all
the
other
aspects
were
strikingly
and
harmoniously
and
thrillingly
african
a
flock
of
these
natives
would
intrude
looking
wholly
out
of
place
and
spoil
it
all
making
the
thing
a
grating
discord
half
african
and
half
american
one
sunday
in
king
william
town
a
score
of
colored
women
came
mincing
across
the
great
barren
square
dressed
oh
in
the
last
perfection
of
fashion
and
newness
and
expensiveness
and
showy
mixture
of
unrelated
colors
all
just
as
i
had
seen
it
so
often
at
home
and
in
their
faces
and
their
gait
was
that
languishing
aristocratic
divine
delight
in
their
finery
which
was
so
familiar
to
me
and
had
always
been
such
a
satisfaction
to
my
eye
and
my
heart
i
seemed
among
old
old
friends
friends
of
fifty
years
and
i
stopped
and
cordially
greeted
them
they
broke
into
a
laugh
flashing
their
white
teeth
upon
me
and
all
answered
at
once
i
did
not
understand
a
word
they
said
i
was
astonished
i
was
not
dreaming
that
they
would
answer
in
anything
but
american
the
voices
too
of
the
african
women
were
familiar
to
me
sweet
and
musical
just
like
those
of
the
slave
women
of
my
early
days
i
followed
a
couple
of
them
all
over
the
orange
free
state
no
over
its
capital
bloemfontein
to
hear
their
liquid
voices
and
the
happy
ripple
of
their
laughter
their
language
was
a
large
improvement
upon
american
also
upon
the
zulu
it
had
no
zulu
clicks
in
it
and
it
seemed
to
have
no
angles
or
corners
no
roughness
no
vile
s
or
other
hissing
sounds
but
was
very
very
mellow
and
rounded
and
flowing
in
moving
about
the
country
in
the
trains
i
had
opportunity
to
see
a
good
many
boers
of
the
veldt
one
day
at
a
village
station
a
hundred
of
them
got
out
of
the
cars
to
feed
their
clothes
were
very
interesting
for
ugliness
of
shapes
and
for
miracles
of
ugly
colors
inharmoniously
associated
they
were
a
record
the
effect
was
nearly
as
exciting
and
interesting
as
that
produced
by
the
brilliant
and
beautiful
clothes
and
perfect
taste
always
on
view
at
the
indian
railway
stations
one
man
had
corduroy
trousers
of
a
faded
chewing
gum
tint
and
they
were
new
showing
that
this
tint
did
not
come
by
calamity
but
was
intentional
the
very
ugliest
color
i
have
ever
seen
a
gaunt
shackly
country
lout
six
feet
high
in
battered
gray
slouched
hat
with
wide
brim
and
old
breeches
had
on
a
hideous
woolen
coat
which
was
imitation
tiger
skin
wavy
broad
stripes
of
dazzling
yellow
and
deep
brown
i
thought
he
ought
to
be
hanged
and
asked
the
if
it
could
be
arranged
he
said
no
and
not
only
that
but
said
it
rudely
said
it
with
a
quite
unnecessary
show
of
feeling
then
he
muttered
something
about
my
being
a
jackass
and
walked
away
and
pointed
me
out
to
people
and
did
everything
he
could
to
turn
public
sentiment
against
me
it
is
what
one
gets
for
trying
to
do
good
in
the
train
that
day
a
passenger
told
me
some
more
about
boer
life
out
in
the
lonely
veldt
he
said
the
boer
gets
up
early
and
sets
his
niggers
at
their
tasks
pasturing
the
cattle
and
watching
them
eats
smokes
drowses
sleeps
toward
evening
superintends
the
milking
etc
eats
smokes
drowses
goes
to
bed
at
early
candlelight
in
the
fragrant
clothes
he
and
she
have
worn
all
day
and
every
for
years
i
remember
that
last
detail
in
olive
schreiner
story
of
an
african
farm
and
the
passenger
told
me
that
the
boers
were
justly
noted
for
their
hospitality
he
told
me
a
story
about
it
he
said
that
his
grace
the
bishop
of
a
certain
see
was
once
making
a
through
the
tavernless
veldt
and
one
night
he
stopped
with
a
boer
after
supper
was
shown
to
bed
he
undressed
weary
and
worn
out
and
was
soon
sound
asleep
in
the
night
he
woke
up
feeling
crowded
and
suffocated
and
found
the
old
boer
and
his
fat
wife
in
bed
with
him
one
on
each
side
with
all
their
clothes
on
and
snoring
he
had
to
stay
there
and
stand
it
awake
and
suffering
until
toward
dawn
when
sleep
again
fell
upon
him
for
an
hour
then
he
woke
again
the
boer
was
gone
but
the
wife
was
still
at
his
side
those
reformers
detested
that
boer
prison
they
were
not
used
to
cramped
quarters
and
tedious
hours
and
weary
idleness
and
early
to
bed
and
limited
movement
and
arbitrary
and
irritating
rules
and
the
absence
of
the
luxuries
which
wealth
comforts
the
day
and
the
night
with
the
confinement
told
upon
their
bodies
and
their
spirits
still
they
were
superior
men
and
they
made
the
best
that
was
to
be
made
of
the
circumstances
their
wives
smuggled
delicacies
to
them
which
helped
to
smooth
the
way
down
for
the
prison
fare
in
the
train
told
me
that
the
boer
treated
the
black
prisoners
even
political
ones
mercilessly
an
african
chief
and
his
following
had
been
kept
there
nine
months
without
trial
and
during
all
that
time
they
had
been
without
shelter
from
rain
and
sun
he
said
that
one
day
the
guards
put
a
big
black
in
the
stocks
for
dashing
his
soup
on
the
ground
they
stretched
his
legs
painfully
wide
apart
and
set
him
with
his
back
down
hill
he
could
not
endure
it
and
put
back
his
hands
upon
the
slope
for
a
support
the
guard
ordered
him
to
withdraw
the
support
and
kicked
him

to
me
the
most
interesting
convulsion
of
nature
in
south
africa
was
the
the
rand
gold
fields
are
a
stupendous
marvel
and
they
make
all
other
gold
fields
small
but
i
was
not
a
stranger
to
the
veldt
was
a
noble
thing
to
see
but
it
was
only
another
and
lovelier
variety
of
our
great
plains
the
natives
were
very
far
from
being
uninteresting
but
they
were
not
new
and
as
for
the
towns
i
could
find
my
way
without
a
guide
through
the
most
of
them
because
i
had
learned
the
streets
under
other
names
in
towns
just
like
them
in
other
lands
but
the
diamond
mine
was
a
wholly
fresh
thing
a
splendid
and
absorbing
novelty
very
few
people
in
the
world
have
seen
the
diamond
in
its
home
it
has
but
three
or
four
homes
in
the
world
whereas
gold
has
a
million
it
is
worth
while
to
journey
around
the
globe
to
see
anything
which
can
truthfully
be
called
a
novelty
and
the
diamond
mine
is
the
greatest
and
most
select
and
restricted
novelty
which
the
globe
has
in
stock
the
kimberley
diamond
deposits
were
discovered
about
i
think
when
everything
is
taken
into
consideration
the
wonder
is
that
they
were
not
discovered
five
thousand
years
ago
and
made
familiar
to
the
african
world
for
the
rest
of
time
for
this
reason
the
first
diamonds
were
found
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
they
were
smooth
and
limpid
and
in
the
sunlight
they
vomited
fire
they
were
the
very
things
which
an
african
savage
of
any
era
would
value
above
every
other
thing
in
the
world
excepting
a
glass
bead
for
two
or
three
centuries
we
have
been
buying
his
lands
his
cattle
his
neighbor
and
any
other
thing
he
had
for
sale
for
glass
beads
and
so
it
is
strange
that
he
was
indifferent
to
the
diamonds
for
he
must
have
pickets
them
up
many
and
many
a
time
it
would
not
occur
to
him
to
try
to
sell
them
to
whites
of
course
since
the
whites
already
had
plenty
of
glass
beads
and
more
fashionably
shaped
too
than
these
but
one
would
think
that
the
poorer
sort
of
black
who
could
not
afford
real
glass
would
have
been
humbly
content
to
decorate
himself
with
the
imitation
and
that
presently
the
white
trader
would
notice
the
things
and
dimly
suspect
and
carry
some
of
them
home
and
find
out
what
they
were
and
at
once
empty
a
multitude
of
into
africa
there
are
many
strange
things
in
human
history
one
of
the
strangest
is
that
the
sparkling
diamonds
laid
there
so
long
without
exciting
any
one
interest
the
revelation
came
at
last
by
accident
in
a
boer
hut
out
in
the
wide
solitude
of
the
plains
a
traveling
stranger
noticed
a
child
playing
with
a
bright
object
and
was
told
it
was
a
piece
of
glass
which
had
been
found
in
the
veldt
the
stranger
bought
it
for
a
trifle
and
carried
it
away
and
being
without
honor
made
another
stranger
believe
it
was
a
diamond
and
so
got
out
of
him
for
it
and
was
as
pleased
with
himself
as
if
he
had
done
a
righteous
thing
in
paris
the
wronged
stranger
sold
it
to
a
pawnshop
for
who
sold
it
to
a
countess
for
who
sold
it
to
a
brewer
for
who
traded
it
to
a
king
for
a
dukedom
and
a
pedigree
and
the
king
put
it
up
the
spout
handwritten
note
from
the
greek
meaning
it
i
know
these
particulars
to
be
correct
the
news
flew
around
and
the
south
african
began
the
original
traveler
the
dishonest
one
now
remembered
that
he
had
once
seen
a
boer
teamster
chocking
his
on
a
steep
grade
with
a
diamond
as
large
as
a
football
and
he
laid
aside
his
occupations
and
started
out
to
hunt
for
it
but
not
with
the
intention
of
cheating
anybody
out
of
with
it
for
he
had
reformed
we
now
come
to
matters
more
didactic
diamonds
are
not
imbedded
in
rock
ledges
fifty
miles
long
like
the
johannesburg
gold
but
are
distributed
through
the
rubbish
of
a
well
so
to
speak
the
well
is
rich
its
walls
are
sharply
defined
outside
of
the
walls
are
no
diamonds
the
well
is
a
crater
and
a
large
one
before
it
had
been
meddled
with
its
surface
was
even
with
the
level
plain
and
there
was
no
sign
to
suggest
that
it
was
there
the
pasturage
covering
the
surface
of
the
kimberley
crater
was
sufficient
for
the
support
of
a
cow
and
the
pasturage
underneath
was
sufficient
for
the
support
of
a
kingdom
but
the
cow
did
not
know
it
and
lost
her
chance
the
kimberley
crater
is
roomy
enough
to
admit
the
roman
coliseum
the
bottom
of
the
crater
has
not
been
reached
and
no
one
can
tell
how
far
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
it
goes
originally
it
was
a
perpendicular
hole
packed
solidly
full
of
blue
rock
or
cement
and
scattered
through
that
blue
mass
like
raisins
in
a
pudding
were
the
diamonds
as
deep
down
in
the
earth
as
the
blue
stuff
extends
so
deep
will
the
diamonds
be
found
there
are
three
or
four
other
celebrated
craters
near
by
a
circle
three
miles
in
diameter
would
enclose
them
all
they
are
owned
by
the
de
beers
company
a
consolidation
of
diamond
properties
arranged
by
rhodes
twelve
or
fourteen
years
ago
the
de
beers
owns
other
craters
they
are
under
the
grass
but
the
de
beers
knows
where
they
are
and
will
open
them
some
day
if
the
market
should
require
it
originally
the
diamond
deposits
were
the
property
of
the
orange
free
state
but
a
judicious
rectification
of
the
boundary
line
shifted
them
over
into
the
british
territory
of
cape
colony
a
high
official
of
the
free
state
told
me
that
the
sum
of
was
handed
to
his
commonwealth
as
a
compromise
or
indemnity
or
something
of
the
sort
and
that
he
thought
his
commonwealth
did
wisely
to
take
the
money
and
keep
out
of
a
dispute
since
the
power
was
all
on
the
one
side
and
the
weakness
all
on
the
other
the
de
beers
company
dig
out
worth
of
diamonds
per
week
now
the
cape
got
the
territory
but
no
profit
for
rhodes
and
the
rothschilds
and
the
other
de
beers
people
own
the
mines
and
they
pay
no
taxes
in
our
day
the
mines
are
worked
upon
scientific
principles
under
the
guidance
of
the
ablest
talent
procurable
in
america
there
are
elaborate
works
for
reducing
the
blue
rock
and
passing
it
through
one
process
after
another
until
every
diamond
it
contains
has
been
hunted
down
and
secured
i
watched
the
concentrators
at
work
big
tanks
containing
mud
and
water
and
invisible
diamonds
and
was
told
that
each
could
stir
and
churn
and
properly
treat
of
mud
per
day
pounds
to
the
and
reduce
it
to
of
slush
i
saw
the
carloads
of
slush
taken
to
the
pulsators
and
there
reduced
to
quarter
of
a
load
of
nice
clean
sand
then
i
followed
it
to
the
sorting
tables
and
saw
the
men
deftly
and
swiftly
spread
it
out
and
brush
it
about
and
seize
the
diamonds
as
they
showed
up
i
assisted
and
once
i
found
a
diamond
half
as
large
as
an
almond
it
is
an
exciting
kind
of
fishing
and
you
feel
a
fine
thrill
of
pleasure
every
time
you
detect
the
glow
of
one
of
those
limpid
pebbles
through
the
veil
of
dark
sand
i
would
like
to
spend
my
saturday
holidays
in
that
charming
sport
every
now
and
then
of
course
there
are
disappointments
sometimes
you
find
a
diamond
which
is
not
a
diamond
it
is
only
a
quartz
crystal
or
some
such
worthless
thing
the
expert
can
generally
distinguish
it
from
the
precious
stone
which
it
is
counterfeiting
but
if
he
is
in
doubt
he
lays
it
on
a
flatiron
and
hits
it
with
a
sledgehammer
if
it
is
a
diamond
it
holds
its
own
if
it
is
anything
else
it
is
reduced
to
powder
i
liked
that
experiment
very
much
and
did
not
tire
of
repetitions
of
it
it
was
full
of
enjoyable
apprehensions
unmarred
by
any
personal
sense
of
risk
the
de
beers
concern
treats
carloads
about
tons
of
blue
rock
per
day
and
the
result
is
three
pounds
of
diamonds
value
uncut
to
after
cutting
they
will
weigh
considerably
less
than
a
pound
but
will
be
worth
four
or
five
times
as
much
as
they
were
before
all
the
plain
around
that
region
is
spread
over
a
foot
deep
with
blue
rock
placed
there
by
the
company
and
looks
like
a
plowed
field
exposure
for
a
length
of
time
make
the
rock
easier
to
work
than
it
is
when
it
comes
out
of
the
mine
if
mining
should
cease
now
the
supply
of
rock
spread
over
those
fields
would
furnish
the
usual
per
day
to
the
separating
works
during
three
years
the
fields
are
fenced
and
watched
and
at
night
they
are
under
the
constant
inspection
of
lofty
electric
searchlight
they
contain
fifty
or
sixty
million
worth
of
diamonds
and
there
is
an
abundance
of
enterprising
thieves
around
in
the
dirt
of
the
kimberley
streets
there
is
much
hidden
wealth
some
time
ago
the
people
were
granted
the
privilege
of
a
free
there
was
a
general
rush
the
work
was
done
with
thoroughness
and
a
good
harvest
of
diamonds
was
gathered
the
deep
mining
is
done
by
natives
there
are
many
hundreds
of
them
they
live
in
quarters
built
around
the
inside
of
a
great
compound
they
are
a
jolly
and
lot
and
accommodating
they
performed
a
for
us
which
was
the
wildest
exhibition
i
have
ever
seen
they
are
not
allowed
outside
of
the
compound
during
their
term
of
service
three
months
i
think
it
is
as
a
rule
they
go
down
the
shaft
stand
their
watch
come
up
again
are
searched
and
go
to
bed
or
to
their
amusements
in
the
compound
and
this
routine
they
repeat
day
in
and
day
out
it
is
thought
that
they
do
not
now
steal
many
diamonds
successfully
they
used
to
swallow
them
and
find
other
ways
of
concealing
them
but
the
white
man
found
ways
of
beating
their
various
games
one
man
cut
his
leg
and
shoved
a
diamond
into
the
wound
but
even
that
project
did
not
succeed
when
they
find
a
fine
large
diamond
they
are
more
likely
to
report
it
than
to
steal
it
for
in
the
former
case
they
get
a
reward
and
in
the
latter
they
are
quite
apt
to
merely
get
into
trouble
some
years
ago
in
a
mine
not
owned
by
the
de
beers
a
black
found
what
has
been
claimed
to
be
the
largest
diamond
known
to
the
world
history
and
as
a
reward
he
was
released
from
service
and
given
a
blanket
a
horse
and
five
hundred
dollars
it
made
him
a
vanderbilt
he
could
buy
four
wives
and
have
money
left
four
wives
are
an
ample
support
for
a
native
with
four
wives
he
is
wholly
independent
and
need
never
do
a
stroke
of
work
again
that
great
diamond
weighs
carats
some
say
it
is
as
big
as
a
piece
of
alum
others
say
it
is
as
large
as
a
bite
of
rock
candy
but
the
best
authorities
agree
that
it
is
almost
exactly
the
size
of
a
chunk
of
ice
but
those
details
are
not
important
and
in
my
opinion
not
trustworthy
it
has
a
flaw
in
it
otherwise
it
would
be
of
incredible
value
as
it
is
it
is
held
to
be
worth
after
cutting
it
ought
to
be
worth
from
to
therefore
persons
desiring
to
save
money
should
buy
it
now
it
is
owned
by
a
syndicate
and
apparently
there
is
no
satisfactory
market
for
it
it
is
earning
nothing
it
is
eating
its
head
off
up
to
this
time
it
has
made
nobody
rich
but
the
native
who
found
it
he
found
it
in
a
mine
which
was
being
worked
by
contract
that
is
to
say
a
company
had
bought
the
privilege
of
taking
from
the
mine
carloads
of
for
a
sum
down
and
a
royalty
their
speculation
had
not
paid
but
on
the
very
day
that
their
privilege
ran
out
that
native
found
the
and
handed
it
over
to
them
even
the
diamond
culture
is
not
without
its
romantic
episodes
the
is
a
large
diamond
and
valuable
but
it
can
not
compete
in
these
matters
with
three
which
according
to
legend
are
among
the
crown
trinkets
of
portugal
and
russia
one
of
these
is
held
to
be
worth
another
and
the
third
something
over
those
are
truly
wonderful
diamonds
whether
they
exist
or
not
and
yet
they
are
of
but
little
importance
by
comparison
with
the
one
wherewith
the
boer
wagoner
chocked
his
wheel
on
that
steep
grade
as
heretofore
referred
to
in
kimberley
i
had
some
conversation
with
the
man
who
saw
the
boer
do
that
an
incident
which
had
occurred
or
years
before
i
had
my
talk
with
him
he
assured
me
that
that
diamond
value
could
have
been
over
a
billion
dollars
but
not
under
it
i
believed
him
because
he
had
devoted
years
to
hunting
for
it
and
was
in
a
position
to
know
a
fitting
and
interesting
finish
to
an
examination
of
the
tedious
and
laborious
and
costly
processes
whereby
the
diamonds
are
gotten
out
of
the
deeps
of
the
earth
and
freed
from
the
base
stuffs
which
imprison
them
is
the
visit
to
the
de
beers
offices
in
the
town
of
kimberley
where
the
result
of
each
day
mining
is
brought
every
day
and
weighed
assorted
valued
and
deposited
in
safes
against
an
unknown
and
unaccredited
person
can
not
get
into
that
place
and
it
seemed
apparent
from
the
generous
supply
of
warning
and
protective
and
prohibitory
signs
that
were
posted
all
about
that
not
even
the
known
and
accredited
can
steal
diamonds
there
without
inconvenience
we
saw
the
day
output
shining
little
nests
of
diamonds
distributed
a
foot
apart
along
a
counter
each
nest
reposing
upon
a
sheet
of
white
paper
that
day
catch
was
about
worth
in
the
course
of
a
year
half
a
ton
of
diamonds
pass
under
the
scales
there
and
sleep
on
that
counter
the
resulting
money
is
or
profit
about
young
girls
were
doing
the
sorting
a
nice
clean
dainty
and
probably
distressing
employment
every
day
ducal
incomes
sift
and
sparkle
through
the
fingers
of
those
young
girls
yet
they
go
to
bed
at
night
as
poor
as
they
were
when
they
got
up
in
the
morning
the
same
thing
next
day
and
all
the
days
they
are
beautiful
things
those
diamonds
in
their
native
state
they
are
of
various
shapes
they
have
flat
surfaces
rounded
borders
and
never
a
sharp
edge
they
are
of
all
colors
and
shades
of
color
from
dewdrop
white
to
actual
black
and
their
smooth
and
rounded
surfaces
and
contours
variety
of
color
and
transparent
limpidity
make
them
look
like
piles
of
assorted
candies
a
very
light
straw
color
is
their
commonest
tint
it
seemed
to
me
that
these
uncut
gems
must
be
more
beautiful
than
any
cut
ones
could
be
but
when
a
collection
of
cut
ones
was
brought
out
i
saw
my
mistake
nothing
is
so
beautiful
as
a
rose
diamond
with
the
light
playing
through
it
except
that
uncostly
thing
which
is
just
like
it
wavy
with
the
sunlight
playing
through
it
and
striking
a
bottom
before
the
middle
of
july
we
reached
cape
town
and
the
end
of
our
african
journeyings
and
well
satisfied
for
towering
above
us
was
table
mountain
a
reminder
that
we
had
now
seen
each
and
all
of
the
great
features
of
south
africa
except
cecil
rhodes
i
realize
that
that
is
a
large
exception
i
know
quite
well
that
whether
rhodes
is
the
lofty
and
worshipful
patriot
and
statesman
that
multitudes
believe
him
to
be
or
satan
come
again
as
the
rest
of
the
world
account
him
he
is
still
the
most
imposing
figure
in
the
british
empire
outside
of
england
when
he
stands
on
the
cape
of
good
hope
his
shadow
falls
to
the
zambesi
he
is
the
only
colonial
in
the
british
dominions
whose
goings
and
comings
are
chronicled
and
discussed
under
all
the
globe
meridians
and
whose
speeches
unclipped
are
cabled
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
he
is
the
only
unroyal
outsider
whose
arrival
in
london
can
compete
for
attention
with
an
eclipse
that
he
is
an
extraordinary
man
and
not
an
accident
of
fortune
not
even
his
dearest
south
african
enemies
were
willing
to
deny
so
far
as
i
heard
them
testify
the
whole
south
african
world
seemed
to
stand
in
a
kind
of
shuddering
awe
of
him
friend
and
enemy
alike
it
was
as
if
he
were
on
the
one
side
on
the
other
proprietor
of
the
people
able
to
make
them
or
ruin
them
by
his
breath
worshiped
by
many
hated
by
many
but
blasphemed
by
none
among
the
judicious
and
even
by
the
indiscreet
in
guarded
whispers
only
what
is
the
secret
of
his
formidable
supremacy
one
says
it
is
his
prodigious
wealth
a
wealth
whose
drippings
in
salaries
and
in
other
ways
support
multitudes
and
make
them
his
interested
and
loyal
vassals
another
says
it
is
his
personal
magnetism
and
his
persuasive
tongue
and
that
these
hypnotize
and
make
happy
slaves
of
all
that
drift
within
the
circle
of
their
influence
another
says
it
is
his
majestic
ideas
his
vast
schemes
for
the
territorial
aggrandizement
of
england
his
patriotic
and
unselfish
ambition
to
spread
her
beneficent
protection
and
her
just
rule
over
the
pagan
wastes
of
africa
and
make
luminous
the
african
darkness
with
the
glory
of
her
name
and
another
says
he
wants
the
earth
and
wants
it
for
his
own
and
that
the
belief
that
he
will
get
it
and
let
his
friends
in
on
the
ground
floor
is
the
secret
that
rivets
so
many
eyes
upon
him
and
keeps
him
in
the
zenith
where
the
view
is
unobstructed
one
may
take
his
choice
they
are
all
the
same
price
one
fact
is
sure
he
keeps
his
prominence
and
a
vast
following
no
matter
what
he
does
he
deceives
the
duke
of
fife
it
is
the
duke
word
but
that
does
not
destroy
the
duke
loyalty
to
him
he
tricks
the
reformers
into
immense
trouble
with
his
raid
but
the
most
of
them
believe
he
meant
well
he
weeps
over
the
harshly
taxed
johannesburgers
and
makes
them
his
friends
at
the
same
time
he
taxes
his
per
and
so
wins
their
affection
and
their
confidence
that
they
are
squelched
with
despair
at
every
rumor
that
the
charter
is
to
be
annulled
he
raids
and
robs
and
slays
and
enslaves
the
matabele
and
gets
worlds
of
applause
for
it
he
has
beguiled
england
into
buying
charter
waste
paper
for
bank
of
england
notes
ton
for
ton
and
the
ravished
still
burn
incense
to
him
as
the
eventual
god
of
plenty
he
has
done
everything
he
could
think
of
to
pull
himself
down
to
the
ground
he
has
done
more
than
enough
to
pull
sixteen
great
men
down
yet
there
he
stands
to
this
day
upon
his
dizzy
summit
under
the
dome
of
the
sky
an
apparent
permanency
the
marvel
of
the
time
the
mystery
of
the
age
an
archangel
with
wings
to
half
the
world
satan
with
a
tail
to
the
other
half
i
admire
him
i
frankly
confess
it
and
when
his
time
comes
i
shall
buy
a
piece
of
the
rope
for
a
keepsake
conclusion
i
have
traveled
more
than
anyone
else
and
i
have
noticed
that
even
the
angels
speak
english
with
an
accent
wilson
new
calendar
i
saw
table
rock
anyway
a
majestic
pile
it
is
feet
high
it
is
also
feet
high
these
figures
may
be
relied
upon
i
got
them
in
cape
town
from
the
two
citizens
men
who
had
made
table
rock
the
study
of
their
lives
and
i
saw
table
bay
so
named
for
its
levelness
i
saw
the
castle
built
by
the
dutch
east
india
company
three
hundred
years
ago
where
the
commanding
general
lives
i
saw
bay
where
the
admiral
lives
i
saw
the
government
also
the
parliament
where
they
quarreled
in
two
languages
when
i
was
there
and
agreed
in
none
i
saw
the
club
i
saw
and
explored
the
beautiful
drives
that
wind
about
the
mountains
and
through
the
paradise
where
the
villas
are
also
i
saw
some
of
the
fine
old
dutch
mansions
pleasant
homes
of
the
early
times
pleasant
homes
and
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
their
hospitalities
and
just
before
i
sailed
i
saw
in
one
of
them
a
quaint
old
picture
which
was
a
link
in
a
curious
romance
a
picture
of
a
pale
intellectual
young
man
in
a
pink
coat
with
a
high
black
collar
it
was
a
portrait
of
james
barry
a
military
surgeon
who
came
out
to
the
cape
fifty
years
ago
with
his
regiment
he
was
a
wild
young
fellow
and
was
guilty
of
various
kinds
of
misbehavior
he
was
several
times
reported
to
headquarters
in
england
and
it
was
in
each
case
expected
that
orders
would
come
out
to
deal
with
him
promptly
and
severely
but
for
some
mysterious
reason
no
orders
of
any
kind
ever
came
back
nothing
came
but
just
an
impressive
silence
this
made
him
an
imposing
and
uncanny
wonder
to
the
town
next
he
was
up
he
was
made
medical
superintendent
general
and
transferred
to
india
presently
he
was
back
at
the
cape
again
and
at
his
escapades
once
more
there
were
plenty
of
pretty
girls
but
none
of
them
caught
him
none
of
them
could
get
hold
of
his
heart
evidently
he
was
not
a
marrying
man
and
that
was
another
marvel
another
puzzle
and
made
no
end
of
perplexed
talk
once
he
was
called
in
the
night
an
obstetric
service
to
do
what
he
could
for
a
woman
who
was
believed
to
be
dying
he
was
prompt
and
scientific
and
saved
both
mother
and
child
there
are
other
instances
of
record
which
testify
to
his
mastership
of
his
profession
and
many
which
testify
to
his
love
of
it
and
his
devotion
to
it
among
other
adventures
of
his
was
a
duel
of
a
desperate
sort
fought
with
swords
at
the
castle
he
killed
his
man
the
child
heretofore
mentioned
as
having
been
saved
by
barry
so
long
ago
was
named
for
him
and
still
lives
in
cape
town
he
had
barry
portrait
painted
and
gave
it
to
the
gentleman
in
whose
old
dutch
house
i
saw
it
the
quaint
figure
in
pink
coat
and
high
black
collar
the
story
seems
to
be
arriving
nowhere
but
that
is
because
i
have
not
finished
barry
died
in
cape
town
years
ago
it
was
then
discovered
that
he
was
a
woman
the
legend
goes
that
enquiries
soon
silenced
developed
the
fact
that
she
was
a
daughter
of
a
great
english
house
and
that
that
was
why
her
cape
wildnesses
brought
no
punishment
and
got
no
notice
when
reported
to
the
government
at
home
her
name
was
an
alias
she
had
disgraced
herself
with
her
people
so
she
chose
to
change
her
name
and
her
sex
and
take
a
new
start
in
the
world
we
sailed
on
the
of
july
in
the
norman
a
beautiful
ship
perfectly
appointed
the
voyage
to
england
occupied
a
short
fortnight
without
a
stop
except
at
madeira
a
good
and
restful
voyage
for
tired
people
and
there
were
several
of
us
i
seemed
to
have
been
lecturing
a
thousand
years
though
it
was
only
a
twelvemonth
and
a
considerable
number
of
the
others
were
reformers
who
were
fagged
out
with
their
five
months
of
seclusion
in
the
pretoria
prison
our
trip
around
the
earth
ended
at
the
southampton
pier
where
we
embarked
thirteen
months
before
it
seemed
a
fine
and
large
thing
to
have
accomplished
the
circumnavigation
of
this
great
globe
in
that
little
time
and
i
was
privately
proud
of
it
for
a
moment
then
came
one
of
those
astronomical
reports
from
the
whereby
it
appeared
that
another
great
body
of
light
had
lately
flamed
up
in
the
remotenesses
of
space
which
was
traveling
at
a
gait
which
would
enable
it
to
do
all
that
i
had
done
in
a
minute
and
a
half
human
pride
is
not
worth
while
there
is
always
something
lying
in
wait
to
take
the
wind
out
of
it
