introduction
the
little
book
by
epictetus
called
or
manual
has
played
a
disproportionately
large
role
in
the
rise
of
modern
attitudes
and
modern
philosophy
as
soon
as
it
had
been
translated
into
the
vernacular
languages
it
became
a
bestseller
among
independent
intellectuals
among
thinkers
and
among
philosophers
of
a
subjective
cast
montaigne
had
a
copy
of
the
among
his
books
pascal
violently
rejected
the
megalomaniac
pride
of
the
stoic
philosopher
frederick
the
great
carried
the
book
with
him
on
all
campaigns
it
was
a
source
of
inspiration
and
encouragement
to
anthony
earl
of
shaftesbury
in
the
serious
illness
which
ended
only
in
his
death
many
pages
of
his
diaries
contain
passages
copied
from
the
it
has
been
studied
and
widely
quoted
by
scottish
philosophers
like
francis
hutcheson
adam
smith
and
adam
ferguson
who
valued
stoic
moral
philosophy
for
its
reconciliation
of
social
dependency
and
personal
independence
that
there
was
a
rebirth
of
stoicism
in
the
centuries
of
rebirth
which
marked
the
emergence
of
the
modern
age
was
not
mere
chance
philosophical
moral
and
social
conditions
of
the
time
united
to
cause
it
roman
stoicism
had
been
developed
in
times
of
despotism
as
a
philosophy
of
lonely
and
courageous
souls
who
had
recognized
the
redeeming
power
of
philosophical
reason
in
all
the
moral
and
social
purposes
of
life
philosophy
as
a
way
of
life
makes
men
free
it
is
the
last
ditch
stand
of
liberty
in
a
world
of
servitude
many
elements
in
the
new
age
led
to
thought
which
had
structural
affinity
with
roman
stoicism
modern
times
had
created
the
independent
thinker
the
free
intellectual
in
a
secular
civilization
modern
times
had
destroyed
medieval
liberties
and
had
established
the
new
despotism
of
the
absolute
state
supported
by
ecclesiastical
authority
modern
philosophies
continued
the
basic
trend
in
stoicism
in
making
the
subjective
consciousness
the
foundation
of
philosophy
the
stoic
emphasis
on
moral
problems
was
also
appealing
in
an
era
of
rapid
transition
when
all
the
values
which
had
previously
been
taken
for
granted
were
questioned
and
reconsidered
while
it
is
interesting
to
observe
how
varied
were
the
effects
produced
by
this
small
volume
this
epitome
of
the
stoic
system
of
moral
philosophy
these
effects
seem
still
more
remarkable
when
we
consider
that
it
was
not
intended
to
be
a
philosophical
treatise
on
stoicism
for
students
it
was
rather
to
be
a
guide
for
the
advanced
student
of
stoicism
to
show
him
the
best
roads
toward
the
goal
of
becoming
a
true
philosopher
thus
epictetus
and
his
have
a
unique
position
in
roman
stoicism
seneca
and
marcus
aurelius
had
selected
stoic
philosophy
as
the
most
adequate
system
for
expressing
their
existential
problems
of
independence
solitude
and
history
in
this
enterprise
seneca
made
tremendous
strides
toward
the
insights
of
social
psychology
as
a
of
his
consciousness
of
decadence
in
this
he
was
close
to
nietzsche
but
he
was
not
primarily
concerned
with
the
unity
of
the
stoic
system
marcus
aurelius
changed
the
philosophical
doctrine
into
the
regimen
of
the
lonesome
ruler
in
contrast
to
both
epictetus
was
teaching
stoic
philosophy
as
a
doctrine
and
as
a
way
of
life
the
is
a
summary
of
theoretical
and
applied
stoicism
epictetus
was
the
son
of
a
woman
slave
born
between
and
at
hieropolis
in
phrygia
we
do
not
know
how
he
came
to
rome
he
was
there
as
slave
to
one
of
nero
s
distinguished
freedmen
who
served
as
the
emperor
s
secretary
while
still
in
service
epictetus
took
courses
with
musonius
rufus
the
fashionable
stoic
philosopher
who
was
impressed
by
the
sincere
and
dynamic
personality
of
the
young
slave
and
trained
him
to
be
a
stoic
philosopher
epictetus
became
a
free
man
and
began
teaching
philosophy
on
street
corners
in
the
market
but
he
was
not
successful
during
the
rule
of
domitian
epictetus
with
many
other
philosophers
was
exiled
from
rome
probably
between
and
he
went
to
nicopolis
across
actium
in
epirus
where
he
conducted
his
own
school
he
was
so
well
regarded
and
highly
esteemed
that
he
established
the
reputation
of
the
place
as
the
town
of
epictetus
school
students
came
from
athens
and
rome
to
attend
his
classes
private
citizens
came
to
ask
his
advice
and
guidance
some
of
his
students
returned
to
their
homes
to
enter
the
traditional
careers
to
which
they
were
socially
obligated
others
assumed
the
philosophic
way
of
life
in
order
to
escape
into
the
sphere
of
stoic
freedom
among
the
students
was
a
young
roman
flavius
arrian
who
took
courses
at
nicopolis
when
epictetus
was
already
old
flavius
who
was
born
in
was
one
of
the
intimates
of
hadrian
who
made
him
consul
in
he
probably
studied
with
epictetus
between
the
years
and
the
informal
philosophical
talks
which
epictetus
had
with
his
students
fascinated
him
needless
to
say
there
were
also
systematic
courses
in
the
fields
of
philosophy
but
it
was
the
informal
discourses
which
convinced
arrian
that
he
had
finally
discovered
a
stoic
socrates
or
a
stoic
diogenes
who
was
not
merely
teaching
a
doctrine
but
also
living
the
truth
arrian
recorded
many
of
the
discourses
and
informal
conversations
of
epictetus
with
his
intimate
students
he
took
them
down
in
shorthand
in
order
not
to
lose
the
ineffable
liveliness
grace
and
wit
of
the
beloved
teacher
arrian
retired
into
private
life
after
the
death
of
hadrian
in
and
dedicated
himself
to
his
literary
work
he
published
his
notes
on
epictetus
teaching
under
the
title
in
four
the
which
was
also
arranged
by
arrian
is
a
brief
summary
of
the
basic
ideas
of
stoic
philosophy
and
an
introduction
to
the
techniques
required
to
transform
stoic
philosophy
into
a
way
of
life
thus
we
do
not
have
any
original
writings
of
epictetus
like
mead
in
recent
times
he
was
completely
dedicated
to
the
human
and
intellectual
problems
of
his
students
he
left
it
for
them
to
preserve
what
they
considered
to
be
the
lasting
message
of
the
teacher
in
contrast
to
seneca
and
marcus
aurelius
epictetus
had
no
subjective
approach
to
the
stoic
doctrines
moral
philosophy
was
the
center
of
his
teaching
and
epistemology
was
only
instrumental
it
is
even
permissible
to
say
that
he
took
physics
or
cosmology
too
lightly
if
this
is
granted
we
must
admit
that
he
is
completely
absorbed
by
the
fundamentals
of
stoic
thought
as
presented
in
the
epictetus
personality
is
totally
integrated
in
the
act
of
reasoning
which
establishes
conformity
with
nature
a
remarkable
difference
between
the
and
the
should
be
mentioned
the
are
a
living
image
of
the
teacher
in
action
they
present
the
process
of
philosophizing
not
the
finished
product
they
show
the
enthusiastic
and
sober
the
realistic
and
pathetic
moralist
in
constantly
changing
perspectives
determined
by
the
changing
students
with
their
various
concerns
problems
and
questions
his
teachings
his
formulations
have
direct
reference
to
the
various
life
situations
in
which
the
students
should
apply
and
practice
the
master
s
stoic
teaching
no
human
situation
is
omitted
as
a
guide
to
conduct
philosophy
has
relevance
for
all
whether
the
students
have
to
attend
a
dinner
party
whether
they
are
among
competitors
in
a
stadium
or
in
a
swimming
pool
whether
they
have
to
present
themselves
at
court
or
in
an
office
whether
they
are
in
the
company
of
their
mothers
and
sisters
or
of
girl
friends
in
all
human
situations
the
philosopher
knows
the
correct
advice
for
the
philosophical
apprentice
thus
in
the
arrian
presents
the
unique
individuality
of
the
philosopher
and
of
his
applied
moral
method
in
living
contact
with
various
students
in
concrete
situations
epictetus
as
teacher
anticipates
very
modern
educational
methods
in
his
regard
for
the
structure
of
situations
and
the
changing
perspectives
in
human
relationships
nothing
like
this
is
revealed
in
the
gone
is
the
stoic
philosopher
as
living
spirit
what
remains
is
the
living
spirit
of
stoicism
the
is
a
manual
for
the
combat
officer
this
analogy
should
be
taken
seriously
the
roman
stoics
coined
the
formula
militare
life
is
being
a
soldier
the
student
of
philosophy
is
a
private
the
advancing
stoic
is
a
officer
and
the
philosopher
is
the
combat
officer
for
this
reason
all
roman
stoics
apply
metaphors
and
images
derived
from
military
life
apprentice
students
of
stoicism
are
described
as
messengers
as
scouts
of
god
as
representatives
of
divine
nature
the
advancing
student
who
is
close
to
the
goal
of
being
a
philosopher
has
the
rank
of
an
officer
he
is
already
able
to
establish
inner
freedom
and
independence
he
understands
the
basic
stoic
truth
of
subjective
consciousness
which
is
to
distinguish
what
is
in
our
power
from
what
is
not
in
our
power
not
in
our
power
are
all
the
elements
which
constitute
our
environment
such
as
wealth
health
reputation
social
prestige
power
the
lives
of
those
we
love
and
death
in
our
power
are
our
thinking
our
intentions
our
desires
our
decisions
these
make
it
possible
for
us
to
control
ourselves
and
to
make
of
ourselves
elements
and
parts
of
the
universe
of
nature
this
knowledge
of
ourselves
makes
us
free
in
a
world
of
dependencies
this
superiority
of
our
powers
enables
us
to
live
in
conformity
with
nature
the
rational
philosophy
of
control
of
self
and
of
adjustment
to
the
whole
implies
an
asceticism
of
the
emotional
and
the
sensitive
life
the
philosopher
must
examine
and
control
his
passions
his
love
his
tenderness
at
all
times
in
order
always
to
be
ready
for
the
inevitable
moment
of
farewell
the
stoics
practiced
a
jesuitism
la
they
were
able
to
live
in
the
world
as
if
they
did
not
live

to
the
stoic

is
a

a
play
on
the
stage
a
banquet
to
which
we
are
invited
the
briefly
indicated
the
techniques
which
the
philosopher
should
apply
in
acting
well
the
diverse
roles
which
god
might
assign
to
those
whom
he
loves
the
stoic
philosophers
from
the
rules
of
social
conduct
to
the
recommendations
of
sexual
asceticism
before
marriage
and
the
method
of
true
thinking
the
advanced
stoic
will
find
all
principles
of
perfection
and
all
precepts
for
realizing
philosophical
principles
in
his
conduct
in
this
tiny
volume
thus
the
was
liberating
for
all
intellectuals
who
learned
from
it
that
there
are
philosophical
ways
of
from
its
time
the
secular
thinker
could
feel
jubilant
because
he
was
not
in
need
of
a
divine
grace
epictetus
had
taught
him
that
philosophical
reason
could
make
him
free
and
that
he
was
capable
of
redeeming
himself
by
sound
reasoning
in
the
stoic
distinctions
of
personality
and
world
of
i
and
mine
of
subjective
consciousness
and
the
world
of
objects
of
freedom
and
dependence
we
find
implicit
the
basic
elements
of
modern
philosophies
of
rationalism
and
of
objective
idealism
or
pantheism
for
this
reason
there
is
a
continuous
renascence
of
stoicism
from
descartes
grotius
and
bishop
butler
to
montesquieu
adam
smith
and
kant
in
this
long
development
in
modern
times
the
tiny
of
epictetus
played
a
remarkable
part
the
translations
of
epictetus
and
of
all
other
stoics
had
the
widest
effect
on
philosophers
theologians
and
lay
thinkers
they
were
studied
by
the
clergy
of
the
various
christian
denominations
by
the
scientists
who
were
striving
for
a
natural
religion
and
by
the
independent
philosophers
who
were
eager
to
separate
philosophy
from
religion
there
were
many
outstanding
bishops
in
the
catholic
and
anglican
churches
who
were
eager
to
transform
the
traditions
of
roman
stoicism
into
christian
stoicism
among
the
calvinistic
denominations
were
many
thinkers
who
were
in
sympathy
with
stoic
moral
principles
because
of
their
praise
of
the
austerity
of
life
and
of
the
control
of
passions
likewise
the
adherents
of
natural
religion
were
propagating
stoicism
as
the
ideal
pattern
of
universally
valid
and
intelligible
religion
renascent
stoicism
had
three
functions
in
the
rise
of
the
modern
world
first
it
reconciled
christian
traditions
to
modern
rationalistic
philosophies
secondly
it
established
an
ideal
pattern
of
natural
religion
and
thirdly
it
opened
the
way
for
the
autonomy
of
morals

remember
then
that
if

take
what
belongs
to

for
your
own
you
will
be
hindered
you

you
will
find

with

if
you
take

that
which

view

it

no

you

you

nothing
against

no
one
will

you
you
will
not
have
an
enemy
nor
will
you
suffer
any
harm
aiming
therefore
at
such
great
things
remember
that
you
must
not
allow
yourself
any
inclination
however
slight
toward
the
attainment
of
the
others
but
that
you
must
entirely
quit
some
of
them
and
for
the
present
postpone
the
rest
but
if
you
would
have
these
and
possess
power
and
wealth
likewise
you
may
miss
the
latter
in
seeking
the
former
and
you
will
certainly
fail
of
that
by
which
alone
happiness
and
freedom
are
procured

therefore
to
be
able
to
say
to
every
unpleasing
semblance
you
are
but
a
semblance
and
by
no
means
the
real
and
then
examine
it
by
those
rules
which
you
have
and
first
and
chiefly
by
this
whether
it
concerns
the
things
which
are
within
our
own
power
or
those
which
are
not
and
if
it
concerns
anything
beyond
our
power
be
prepared
to
say
that
it
is
nothing
to
you
ii
remember
that
desire
demands
the
attainment
of
that
of
which
you
are
desirous
and
aversion
demands
the
avoidance
of
that
to
which
you
are
averse
that
he
who
fails
of
the
object
of
his
desires
is
disappointed
and
he
who
incurs
the
object
of
his
aversion
is
wretched
if
then
you
shun
only
those
undesirable
things
which
you
can
control
you
will
never
incur
anything
which
you
shun
but
if
you
shun
sickness
or
death
or
poverty
you
will
run
the
risk
of
wretchedness
remove
the
habit
of
aversion
then
from
all
things
that
are
not
within
our
power
and
apply
it
to
things
undesirable
which
are
within
our
power
but
for
the
present
altogether
restrain
desire
for
if
you
desire
any
of
the
things
not
within
our
own
power
you
must
necessarily
be
disappointed
and
you
are
not
yet
secure
of
those
which
are
within
our
power
and
so
are
legitimate
objects
of
desire
where
it
is
practically
necessary
for
you
to
pursue
or
avoid
anything
do
even
this
with
discretion
and
gentleness
and
moderation
iii
with
regard
to
whatever
objects
either
delight
the
mind
or
contribute
to
use
or
are
tenderly
beloved
remind
yourself
of
what
nature
they
are
beginning
with
the
merest
trifles
if
you
have
a
favorite
cup
that
it
is
but
a
cup
of
which
you
are
fond
thus
if
it
is
broken
you
can
bear
it
if
you
embrace
your
child
or
your
wife
that
you
embrace
a
thus
if
either
of
them
dies
you
can
bear
it
iv
when
you
set
about
any
action
remind
yourself
of
what
nature
the
action
is
if
you
are
going
to
bathe
represent
to
yourself
the
incidents
usual
in
the
persons
pouring
out
others
pushing
in
others
scolding
others
pilfering
and
thus
you
will
more
safely
go
about
this
action
if
you
say
to
yourself
i
will
now
go
to
bathe
and
keep
my
own
will
in
harmony
with
and
so
with
regard
to
every
other
action
for
thus
if
any
impediment
arises
in
bathing
you
will
be
able
to
say
it
was
not
only
to
bathe
that
i
desired
but
to
keep
my
will
in
harmony
with
nature
and
i
shall
not
keep
it
thus
if
i
am
out
of
humor
at
things
that
v
men
are
disturbed
not
by
things
but
by
the
views
which
they
take
of
things
thus
death
is
nothing
terrible
else
it
would
have
appeared
so
to
socrates
but
the
terror
consists
in
our
notion
of
death
that
it
is
terrible
when
therefore
we
are
hindered
or
disturbed
or
grieved
let
us
never
impute
it
to
others
but
to
is
to
our
own
views
it
is
the
action
of
an
uninstructed
person
to
reproach
others
for
his
own
misfortunes
of
one
entering
upon
instruction
to
reproach
himself
and
one
perfectly
instructed
to
reproach
neither
others
nor
himself
vi
be
not
elated
at
any
excellence
not
your
own
if
a
horse
should
be
elated
and
say
i
am
handsome
it
might
be
endurable
but
when
you
are
elated
and
say
i
have
a
handsome
horse
know
that
you
are
elated
only
on
the
merit
of
the
horse
what
then
is
your
own
the
use
of
the
phenomena
of
existence
so
that
when
you
are
in
harmony
with
nature
in
this
respect
you
will
be
elated
with
some
reason
for
you
will
be
elated
at
some
good
of
your
own
vii
as
in
a
voyage
when
the
ship
is
at
anchor
if
you
go
on
shore
to
get
water
you
may
amuse
yourself
with
picking
up
a
shellfish
or
a
truffle
in
your
way
but
your
thoughts
ought
to
be
bent
toward
the
ship
and
perpetually
attentive
lest
the
captain
should
call
and
then
you
must
leave
all
these
things
that
you
may
not
have
to
be
carried
on
board
the
vessel
bound
like
a
sheep
thus
likewise
in
life
if
instead
of
a
truffle
or
shellfish
such
a
thing
as
a
wife
or
a
child
be
granted
you
there
is
no
objection
but
if
the
captain
calls
run
to
the
ship
leave
all
these
things
and
never
look
behind
but
if
you
are
old
never
go
far
from
the
ship
lest
you
should
be
missing
when
called
for
viii
demand
not
that
events
should
happen
as
you
wish
but
wish
them
to
happen
as
they
do
happen
and
you
will
go
on
well
ix
sickness
is
an
impediment
to
the
body
but
not
to
the
will
unless
itself
pleases
lameness
is
an
impediment
to
the
leg
but
not
to
the
will
and
say
this
to
yourself
with
regard
to
everything
that
happens
for
you
will
find
it
to
be
an
impediment
to
something
else
but
not
truly
to
yourself
x
upon
every
accident
remember
to
turn
toward
yourself
and
inquire
what
faculty
you
have
for
its
use
if
you
encounter
a
handsome
person
you
will
find
continence
the
faculty
needed
if
pain
then
fortitude
if
reviling
then
patience
and
when
thus
habituated
the
phenomena
of
existence
will
not
overwhelm
you
xi
never
say
of
anything
i
have
lost
it
but
i
have
restored
has
your
child
died
it
is
restored
has
your
wife
died
she
is
restored
has
your
estate
been
taken
away
that
likewise
is
restored
but
it
was
a
bad
man
who
took
what
is
it
to
you
by
whose
hands
he
who
gave
it
has
demanded
it
again
while
he
permits
you
to
possess
it
hold
it
as
something
not
your
own
as
do
travelers
at
an
inn
xii
if
you
would
improve
lay
aside
such
reasonings
as
these
if
i
neglect
my
affairs
i
shall
not
have
a
maintenance
if
i
do
not
punish
my
servant
he
will
be
good
for
for
it
were
better
to
die
of
hunger
exempt
from
grief
and
fear
than
to
live
in
affluence
with
perturbation
and
it
is
better
that
your
servant
should
be
bad
than
you
unhappy
begin
therefore
with
little
things
is
a
little
oil
spilled
or
a
little
wine
stolen
say
to
yourself
this
is
the
price
paid
for
peace
and
tranquillity
and
nothing
is
to
be
had
for
and
when
you
call
your
servant
consider
that
it
is
possible
he
may
not
come
at
your
call
or
if
he
does
that
he
may
not
do
what
you
wish
but
it
is
not
at
all
desirable
for
him
and
very
undesirable
for
you
that
it
should
be
in
his
power
to
cause
you
any
disturbance
xiii
if
you
would
improve
be
content
to
be
thought
foolish
and
dull
with
regard
to
externals
do
not
desire
to
be
thought
to
know
anything
and
though
you
should
appear
to
others
to
be
somebody
distrust
yourself
for
be
assured
it
is
not
easy
at
once
to
keep
your
will
in
harmony
with
nature
and
to
secure
externals
but
while
you
are
absorbed
in
the
one
you
must
of
necessity
neglect
the
other
xiv
if
you
wish
your
children
and
your
wife
and
your
friends
to
live
forever
you
are
foolish
for
you
wish
things
to
be
in
your
power
which
are
not
so
and
what
belongs
to
others
to
be
your
own
so
likewise
if
you
wish
your
servant
to
be
without
fault
you
are
foolish
for
you
wish
vice
not
to
be
vice
but
something
else
but
if
you
wish
not
to
be
disappointed
in
your
desires
that
is
in
your
own
power
exercise
therefore
what
is
in
your
power
a
man
s
master
is
he
who
is
able
to
confer
or
remove
whatever
that
man
seeks
or
shuns
whoever
then
would
be
free
let
him
wish
nothing
let
him
decline
nothing
which
depends
on
others
else
he
must
necessarily
be
a
slave
xv
remember
that
you
must
behave
as
at
a
banquet
is
anything
brought
round
to
you
put
out
your
hand
and
take
a
moderate
share
does
it
pass
by
you
do
not
stop
it
is
it
not
yet
come
do
not
yearn
in
desire
toward
it
but
wait
till
it
reaches
you
so
with
regard
to
children
wife
office
riches
and
you
will
some
time
or
other
be
worthy
to
feast
with
the
gods
and
if
you
do
not
so
much
as
take
the
things
which
are
set
before
you
but
are
able
even
to
forego
them
then
you
will
not
only
be
worthy
to
feast
with
the
gods
but
to
rule
with
them
also
for
by
thus
doing
diogenes
and
heraclitus
and
others
like
them
deservedly
became
divine
and
were
so
recognized
xvi
when
you
see
anyone
weeping
for
grief
either
that
his
son
has
gone
abroad
or
that
he
has
suffered
in
his
affairs
take
care
not
to
be
overcome
by
the
apparent
evil
but
discriminate
and
be
ready
to
say
what
hurts
this
man
is
not
this
occurrence
another
man
might
not
be
hurt
by
the
view
he
chooses
to
take
of
as
far
as
conversation
goes
however
do
not
disdain
to
accommodate
yourself
to
him
and
if
need
be
to
groan
with
him
take
heed
however
not
to
groan
inwardly
too
xvii
remember
that
you
are
an
actor
in
a
drama
of
such
sort
as
the
author
short
then
in
a
short
one
if
long
then
in
a
long
one
if
it
be
his
pleasure
that
you
should
enact
a
poor
man
or
a
cripple
or
a
ruler
or
a
private
citizen
see
that
you
act
it
well
for
this
is
your
act
well
the
given
part
but
to
choose
it
belongs
to
another
xviii
when
a
raven
happens
to
croak
unluckily
be
not
overcome
by
appearances
but
discriminate
and
say
nothing
is
portended
to
either
to
my
paltry
body
or
property
or
reputation
or
children
or
wife
but
to
all
portents
are
lucky
if
i
will
for
whatsoever
happens
it
belongs
to
me
to
derive
advantage
xix
you
can
be
unconquerable
if
you
enter
into
no
combat
in
which
it
is
not
in
your
own
power
to
conquer
when
therefore
you
see
anyone
eminent
in
honors
or
power
or
in
high
esteem
on
any
other
account
take
heed
not
to
be
bewildered
by
appearances
and
to
pronounce
him
happy
for
if
the
essence
of
good
consists
in
things
within
our
own
power
there
will
be
no
room
for
envy
or
emulation
but
for
your
part
do
not
desire
to
be
a
general
or
a
senator
or
a
consul
but
to
be
free
and
the
only
way
to
this
is
a
disregard
of
things
which
lie
not
within
our
own
power
xx
remember
that
it
is
not
he
who
gives
abuse
or
blows
who
affronts
but
the
view
we
take
of
these
things
as
insulting
when
therefore
anyone
provokes
you
be
assured
that
it
is
your
own
opinion
which
provokes
you
try
therefore
in
the
first
place
not
to
be
bewildered
by
appearances
for
if
you
once
gain
time
and
respite
you
will
more
easily
command
yourself
xxi
let
death
and
exile
and
all
other
things
which
appear
terrible
be
daily
before
your
eyes
but
death
chiefly
and
you
will
never
entertain
an
abject
thought
nor
too
eagerly
covet
anything
xxii
if
you
have
an
earnest
desire
toward
philosophy
prepare
yourself
from
the
very
first
to
have
the
multitude
laugh
and
sneer
and
say
he
is
returned
to
us
a
philosopher
all
at
once
and
whence
this
supercilious
look
now
for
your
part
do
not
have
a
supercilious
look
indeed
but
keep
steadily
to
those
things
which
appear
best
to
you
as
one
appointed
by
god
to
this
particular
station
for
remember
that
if
you
are
persistent
those
very
persons
who
at
first
ridiculed
will
afterwards
admire
you
but
if
you
are
conquered
by
them
you
will
incur
a
double
ridicule
xxiii
if
you
ever
happen
to
turn
your
attention
to
externals
for
the
pleasure
of
anyone
be
assured
that
you
have
ruined
your
scheme
of
life
be
content
then
in
everything
with
being
a
philosopher
and
if
you
wish
to
seem
so
likewise
to
anyone
appear
so
to
yourself
and
it
will
suffice
you
xxiv
let
not
such
considerations
as
these
distress
you
i
shall
live
in
discredit
and
be
nobody
for
if
discredit
be
an
evil
you
can
no
more
be
involved
in
evil
through
another
than
in
baseness
is
it
any
business
of
yours
then
to
get
power
or
to
be
admitted
to
an
entertainment
by
no
means
how
then
after
all
is
this
discredit
and
how
it
is
true
that
you
will
be
nobody
anywhere
when
you
ought
to
be
somebody
in
those
things
only
which
are
within
your
own
power
in
which
you
may
be
of
the
greatest
consequence
but
my
friends
will
be
what
do
you
mean
by
unassisted
they
will
not
have
money
from
you
nor
will
you
make
them
roman
citizens
who
told
you
then
that
these
are
among
the
things
within
our
own
power
and
not
rather
the
affairs
of
others
and
who
can
give
to
another
the
things
which
he
himself
has
not
well
but
get
them
then
that
we
too
may
have
a
if
i
can
get
them
with
the
preservation
of
my
own
honor
and
fidelity
and
show
me
the
way
and
i
will
get
them
but
if
you
require
me
to
lose
my
own
proper
good
that
you
may
gain
what
is
no
good
consider
how
unreasonable
and
foolish
you
are
besides
which
would
you
rather
have
a
sum
of
money
or
a
faithful
and
honorable
friend
rather
assist
me
then
to
gain
this
character
than
require
me
to
do
those
things
by
which
i
may
lose
it
well
but
my
country
say
you
as
far
as
depends
upon
me
will
be
unassisted
here
again
what
assistance
is
this
you
mean
it
will
not
have
porticos
nor
baths
of
your
providing
and
what
signifies
that
why
neither
does
a
smith
provide
it
with
shoes
nor
a
shoemaker
with
arms
it
is
enough
if
everyone
fully
performs
his
own
proper
business
and
were
you
to
supply
it
with
another
faithful
and
honorable
citizen
would
not
he
be
of
use
to
it
yes
therefore
neither
are
you
yourself
useless
to
it
what
place
then
say
you
shall
i
hold
in
the
state
whatever
you
can
hold
with
the
preservation
of
your
fidelity
and
honor
but
if
by
desiring
to
be
useful
to
that
you
lose
these
how
can
you
serve
your
country
when
you
have
become
faithless
and
shameless
xxv
is
anyone
preferred
before
you
at
an
entertainment
or
in
courtesies
or
in
confidential
intercourse
if
these
things
are
good
you
ought
to
rejoice
that
he
has
them
and
if
they
are
evil
do
not
be
grieved
that
you
have
them
not
and
remember
that
you
can
not
be
permitted
to
rival
others
in
externals
without
using
the
same
means
to
obtain
them
for
how
can
he
who
will
not
haunt
the
door
of
any
man
will
not
attend
him
will
not
praise
him
have
an
equal
share
with
him
who
does
these
things
you
are
unjust
then
and
unreasonable
if
you
are
unwilling
to
pay
the
price
for
which
these
things
are
sold
and
would
have
them
for
nothing
for
how
much
are
lettuces
sold
an
obulus
for
instance
if
another
then
paying
an
obulus
takes
the
lettuces
and
you
not
paying
it
go
without
them
do
not
imagine
that
he
has
gained
any
advantage
over
you
for
as
he
has
the
lettuces
so
you
have
the
obulus
which
you
did
not
give
so
in
the
present
case
you
have
not
been
invited
to
such
a
person
s
entertainment
because
you
have
not
paid
him
the
price
for
which
a
supper
is
sold
it
is
sold
for
praise
it
is
sold
for
attendance
give
him
then
the
value
if
it
be
for
your
advantage
but
if
you
would
at
the
same
time
not
pay
the
one
and
yet
receive
the
other
you
are
unreasonable
and
foolish
have
you
nothing
then
in
place
of
the
supper
yes
indeed
you
to
praise
him
whom
you
do
not
like
to
praise
not
to
bear
the
insolence
of
his
lackeys
xxvi
the
will
of
nature
may
be
learned
from
things
upon
which
we
are
all
agreed
as
when
our
neighbor
s
boy
has
broken
a
cup
or
the
like
we
are
ready
at
once
to
say
these
are
casualties
that
will
happen
be
assured
then
that
when
your
own
cup
is
likewise
broken
you
ought
to
be
affected
just
as
when
another
s
cup
was
broken
now
apply
this
to
greater
things
is
the
child
or
wife
of
another
dead
there
is
no
one
who
would
not
say
this
is
an
accident
of
but
if
anyone
s
own
child
happens
to
die
it
is
immediately
alas
how
wretched
am
i
it
should
be
always
remembered
how
we
are
affected
on
hearing
the
same
thing
concerning
others
xxvii
as
a
mark
is
not
set
up
for
the
sake
of
missing
the
aim
so
neither
does
the
nature
of
evil
exist
in
the
world
xxviii
if
a
person
had
delivered
up
your
body
to
some
you
would
certainly
be
angry
and
do
you
feel
no
shame
in
delivering
up
your
own
mind
to
any
reviler
to
be
disconcerted
and
confounded
xxix
in
every
affair
consider
what
precedes
and
what
follows
and
then
undertake
it
otherwise
you
will
begin
with
spirit
indeed
careless
of
the
consequences
and
when
these
are
developed
you
will
shamefully
desist
i
would
conquer
at
the
olympic
but
consider
what
precedes
and
what
follows
and
then
if
it
be
for
your
advantage
engage
in
the
affair
you
must
conform
to
rules
submit
to
a
diet
refrain
from
dainties
exercise
your
body
whether
you
choose
it
or
not
at
a
stated
hour
in
heat
and
cold
you
must
drink
no
cold
water
and
sometimes
no
a
word
you
must
give
yourself
up
to
your
trainer
as
to
a
physician
then
in
the
combat
you
may
be
thrown
into
a
ditch
dislocate
your
arm
turn
your
ankle
swallow
an
abundance
of
dust
receive
stripes
for
negligence
and
after
all
lose
the
victory
when
you
have
reckoned
up
all
this
if
your
inclination
still
holds
set
about
the
combat
otherwise
take
notice
you
will
behave
like
children
who
sometimes
play
wrestlers
sometimes
gladiators
sometimes
blow
a
trumpet
and
sometimes
act
a
tragedy
when
they
happen
to
have
seen
and
admired
these
shows
thus
you
too
will
be
at
one
time
a
wrestler
and
another
a
gladiator
now
a
philosopher
now
an
orator
but
nothing
in
earnest
like
an
ape
you
mimic
all
you
see
and
one
thing
after
another
is
sure
to
please
you
but
is
out
of
favor
as
soon
as
it
becomes
familiar
for
you
have
never
entered
upon
anything
considerately
nor
after
having
surveyed
and
tested
the
whole
matter
but
carelessly
and
with
a
halfway
zeal
thus
some
when
they
have
seen
a
philosopher
and
heard
a
man
speaking
like
euphrates
indeed
who
can
speak
like
him
a
mind
to
be
philosophers
too
consider
first
man
what
the
matter
is
and
what
your
own
nature
is
able
to
bear
if
you
would
be
a
wrestler
consider
your
shoulders
your
back
your
thighs
for
different
persons
are
made
for
different
things
do
you
think
that
you
can
act
as
you
do
and
be
a
philosopher
that
you
can
eat
drink
be
angry
be
discontented
as
you
are
now
you
must
watch
you
must
labor
you
must
get
the
better
of
certain
appetites
must
quit
your
acquaintances
be
despised
by
your
servant
be
laughed
at
by
those
you
meet
come
off
worse
than
others
in
offices
in
honors
before
tribunals
when
you
have
fully
considered
all
these
things
approach
if
you
is
if
by
parting
with
them
you
have
a
mind
to
purchase
serenity
freedom
and
tranquillity
if
not
do
not
come
hither
do
not
like
children
be
now
a
philosopher
then
a
publican
then
an
orator
and
then
one
of
caesar
s
officers
these
things
are
not
consistent
you
must
be
one
man
either
good
or
bad
you
must
cultivate
either
your
own
reason
or
else
externals
apply
yourself
either
to
things
within
or
without
is
be
either
a
philosopher
or
one
of
the
mob
xxx
duties
are
universally
measured
by
relations
is
a
certain
man
your
father
in
this
are
implied
taking
care
of
him
submitting
to
him
in
all
things
patiently
receiving
his
reproaches
his
correction
but
he
is
a
bad
father
is
your
natural
tie
then
to
a
father
no
but
to
a
father
is
a
brother
unjust
well
preserve
your
own
just
relation
toward
him
consider
not
what
does
but
what
are
to
do
to
keep
your
own
will
in
a
state
conformable
to
nature
for
another
can
not
hurt
you
unless
you
please
you
will
then
be
hurt
when
you
consent
to
be
hurt
in
this
manner
therefore
if
you
accustom
yourself
to
contemplate
the
relations
of
neighbor
citizen
commander
you
can
deduce
from
each
the
corresponding
duties
xxxi
be
assured
that
the
essence
of
piety
toward
the
gods
lies
in
form
right
opinions
concerning
them
as
existing
and
as
governing
the
universe
justly
and
well
and
fix
yourself
in
this
resolution
to
obey
them
and
yield
to
them
and
willingly
follow
them
amidst
all
events
as
being
ruled
by
the
most
perfect
wisdom
for
thus
you
will
never
find
fault
with
the
gods
nor
accuse
them
of
neglecting
you
and
it
is
not
possible
for
this
to
be
affected
in
any
other
way
than
by
withdrawing
yourself
from
things
which
are
not
within
our
own
power
and
by
making
good
or
evil
to
consist
only
in
those
which
are
for
if
you
suppose
any
other
things
to
be
either
good
or
evil
it
is
inevitable
that
when
you
are
disappointed
of
what
you
wish
or
incur
what
you
would
avoid
you
should
reproach
and
blame
their
authors
for
every
creature
is
naturally
formed
to
flee
and
abhor
things
that
appear
hurtful
and
that
which
causes
them
and
to
pursue
and
admire
those
which
appear
beneficial
and
that
which
causes
them
it
is
impracticable
then
that
one
who
supposes
himself
to
be
hurt
should
rejoice
in
the
person
who
as
he
thinks
hurts
him
just
as
it
is
impossible
to
rejoice
in
the
hurt
itself
hence
also
a
father
is
reviled
by
his
son
when
he
does
not
impart
the
things
which
seem
to
be
good
and
this
made
polynices
and
eteocles
mutually
empire
seemed
good
to
both
on
this
account
the
husbandman
reviles
the
gods
and
so
do
the
sailor
the
merchant
or
those
who
have
lost
wife
or
child
for
where
our
interest
is
there
too
is
piety
directed
so
that
whoever
is
careful
to
regulate
his
desires
and
aversions
as
he
ought
is
thus
made
careful
of
piety
likewise
but
it
also
becomes
incumbent
on
everyone
to
offer
libations
and
sacrifices
and
first
fruits
according
to
the
customs
of
his
country
purely
and
not
heedlessly
nor
negligently
not
avariciously
nor
yet
extravagantly
xxxii
when
you
have
recourse
to
divination
remember
that
you
know
not
what
the
event
will
be
and
you
come
to
learn
it
of
the
diviner
but
of
what
nature
it
is
you
knew
before
coming
at
least
if
you
are
of
philosophic
mind
for
if
it
is
among
the
things
not
within
our
own
power
it
can
by
no
means
be
either
good
or
evil
do
not
therefore
bring
with
you
to
the
diviner
either
desire
or
you
will
approach
him
first
clearly
understand
that
every
event
is
indifferent
and
nothing
to
of
whatever
sort
it
may
be
for
it
will
be
in
your
power
to
make
a
right
use
of
it
and
this
no
one
can
hinder
then
come
with
confidence
to
the
gods
as
your
counselors
and
afterwards
when
any
counsel
is
given
you
remember
what
counselors
you
have
assumed
and
whose
advice
you
will
neglect
if
you
disobey
come
to
divination
as
socrates
prescribed
in
cases
of
which
the
whole
consideration
relates
to
the
event
and
in
which
no
opportunities
are
afforded
by
reason
or
any
other
art
to
discover
the
matter
in
view
when
therefore
it
is
our
duty
to
share
the
danger
of
a
friend
or
of
our
country
we
ought
not
to
consult
the
oracle
as
to
whether
we
shall
share
it
with
them
or
not
for
though
the
diviner
should
forewarn
you
that
the
auspices
are
unfavorable
this
means
no
more
than
that
either
death
or
mutilation
or
exile
is
portended
but
we
have
reason
within
us
and
it
directs
us
even
with
these
hazards
to
stand
by
our
friend
and
our
country
attend
therefore
to
the
greater
diviner
the
pythian
god
who
once
cast
out
of
the
temple
him
who
neglected
to
save
his
friend
xxxiii
begin
by
prescribing
to
yourself
some
character
and
demeanor
such
as
you
may
preserve
both
alone
and
in
company
be
mostly
silent
or
speak
merely
what
is
needful
and
in
few
words
we
may
however
enter
sparingly
into
discourse
sometimes
when
occasion
calls
for
it
but
let
it
not
run
on
any
of
the
common
subjects
as
gladiators
or
horse
races
or
athletic
champions
or
food
or
vulgar
topics
of
especially
not
on
men
so
as
either
to
blame
or
praise
or
make
comparisons
if
you
are
able
then
by
your
own
conversation
bring
over
that
of
your
company
to
proper
subjects
but
if
you
happen
to
find
yourself
among
strangers
be
silent
let
not
your
laughter
be
loud
frequent
or
abundant
avoid
taking
oaths
if
possible
altogether
at
any
rate
so
far
as
you
are
able
avoid
public
and
vulgar
entertainments
but
if
ever
an
occasion
calls
you
to
them
keep
your
attention
upon
the
stretch
that
you
may
not
imperceptibly
slide
into
vulgarity
for
be
assured
that
if
a
person
be
ever
so
pure
himself
yet
if
his
companion
be
corrupted
he
who
converses
with
him
will
be
corrupted
likewise
provide
things
relating
to
the
body
no
further
than
absolute
need
requires
as
meat
drink
clothing
house
retinue
but
cut
off
everything
that
looks
toward
show
and
luxury
before
marriage
guard
yourself
with
all
your
ability
from
unlawful
intercourse
with
women
yet
be
not
uncharitable
or
severe
to
those
who
are
led
into
this
nor
boast
frequently
that
you
yourself
do
otherwise
if
anyone
tells
you
that
a
certain
person
speaks
ill
of
you
do
not
make
excuses
about
what
is
said
of
you
but
answer
he
was
ignorant
of
my
other
faults
else
he
would
not
have
mentioned
these
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
appear
often
at
public
spectacles
but
if
ever
there
is
a
proper
occasion
for
you
to
be
there
do
not
appear
more
solicitous
for
any
other
than
for
is
wish
things
to
be
only
just
as
they
are
and
only
the
best
man
to
win
for
thus
nothing
will
go
against
you
but
abstain
entirely
from
acclamations
and
derision
and
violent
emotions
and
when
you
come
away
do
not
discourse
a
great
deal
on
what
has
passed
and
what
contributes
nothing
to
your
own
amendment
for
it
would
appear
by
such
discourse
that
you
were
dazzled
by
the
show
be
not
prompt
or
ready
to
attend
private
recitations
but
if
you
do
attend
preserve
your
gravity
and
dignity
and
yet
avoid
making
yourself
disagreeable
when
you
are
going
to
confer
with
anyone
and
especially
with
one
who
seems
your
superior
represent
to
yourself
how
socrates
or
zeno
would
behave
in
such
a
case
and
you
will
not
be
at
a
loss
to
meet
properly
whatever
may
occur
when
you
are
going
before
anyone
in
power
fancy
to
yourself
that
you
may
not
find
him
at
home
that
you
may
be
shut
out
that
the
doors
may
not
be
opened
to
you
that
he
may
not
notice
you
if
with
all
this
it
be
your
duty
to
go
bear
what
happens
and
never
say
to
yourself
it
was
not
worth
so
much
for
this
is
vulgar
and
like
a
man
bewildered
by
externals
in
company
avoid
a
frequent
and
excessive
mention
of
your
own
actions
and
dangers
for
however
agreeable
it
may
be
to
yourself
to
allude
to
the
risks
you
have
run
it
is
not
equally
agreeable
to
others
to
hear
your
adventures
avoid
likewise
an
endeavor
to
excite
laughter
for
this
may
readily
slide
you
into
vulgarity
and
besides
may
be
apt
to
lower
you
in
the
esteem
of
your
acquaintance
approaches
to
indecent
discourse
are
likewise
dangerous
therefore
when
anything
of
this
sort
happens
use
the
first
fit
opportunity
to
rebuke
him
who
makes
advances
that
way
or
at
least
by
silence
and
blushing
and
a
serious
look
show
yourself
to
be
displeased
by
such
talk
xxxiv
if
you
are
dazzled
by
the
semblance
of
any
promised
pleasure
guard
yourself
against
being
bewildered
by
it
but
let
the
affair
wait
your
leisure
and
procure
yourself
some
delay
then
bring
to
your
mind
both
points
of
in
which
you
shall
enjoy
the
pleasure
and
that
in
which
you
will
repent
and
reproach
yourself
after
you
have
enjoyed
set
before
you
in
opposition
to
these
how
you
will
rejoice
and
applaud
yourself
if
you
abstain
and
even
though
it
should
appear
to
you
a
seasonable
gratification
take
heed
that
its
enticements
and
allurements
and
seductions
may
not
subdue
you
but
set
in
opposition
to
this
how
much
better
it
is
to
be
conscious
of
having
gained
so
great
a
victory
xxxv
when
you
do
anything
from
a
clear
judgment
that
it
ought
to
be
done
never
shrink
from
being
seen
to
do
it
even
though
the
world
should
misunderstand
it
for
if
you
are
not
acting
rightly
shun
the
action
itself
if
you
are
why
fear
those
who
wrongly
censure
you
xxxvi
as
the
proposition
either
it
is
day
or
it
is
night
has
much
force
in
a
disjunctive
argument
but
none
at
all
in
a
conjunctive
one
so
at
a
feast
to
choose
the
largest
share
is
very
suitable
to
the
bodily
appetite
but
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
social
spirit
of
the
entertainment
remember
then
when
you
eat
with
another
not
only
the
value
to
the
body
of
those
things
which
are
set
before
you
but
also
the
value
of
proper
courtesy
toward
your
host
xxxvii
if
you
have
assumed
any
character
beyond
your
strength
you
have
both
demeaned
yourself
ill
in
that
and
quitted
one
which
you
might
have
supported
xxxviii
as
in
walking
you
take
care
not
to
tread
upon
a
nail
or
turn
your
foot
so
likewise
take
care
not
to
hurt
the
ruling
faculty
of
your
mind
and
if
we
were
to
guard
against
this
in
every
action
we
should
enter
upon
action
more
safely
xxxix
the
body
is
to
everyone
the
proper
measure
of
its
possessions
as
the
foot
is
of
the
shoe
if
therefore
you
stop
at
this
you
will
keep
the
measure
but
if
you
move
beyond
it
you
must
necessarily
be
carried
forward
as
down
a
precipice
as
in
the
case
of
a
shoe
if
you
go
beyond
its
fitness
to
the
foot
it
comes
first
to
be
gilded
then
purple
and
then
studded
with
jewels
for
to
that
which
once
exceeds
the
fit
measure
there
is
no
bound
xl
women
from
fourteen
years
old
are
flattered
by
men
with
the
title
of
mistresses
therefore
perceiving
that
they
are
regarded
only
as
qualified
to
give
men
pleasure
they
begin
to
adorn
themselves
and
in
that
to
place
all
their
hopes
it
is
worth
while
therefore
to
try
that
they
may
perceive
themselves
honored
only
so
far
as
they
appear
beautiful
in
their
demeanor
and
modestly
virtuous
xli
it
is
a
mark
of
want
of
intellect
to
spend
much
time
in
things
relating
to
the
body
as
to
be
immoderate
in
exercises
in
eating
and
drinking
and
in
the
discharge
of
other
animal
functions
these
things
should
be
done
incidentally
and
our
main
strength
be
applied
to
our
reason
xlii
when
any
person
does
ill
by
you
or
speaks
ill
of
you
remember
that
he
acts
or
speaks
from
an
impression
that
it
is
right
for
him
to
do
so
now
it
is
not
possible
that
he
should
follow
what
appears
right
to
you
but
only
what
appears
so
to
himself
therefore
if
he
judges
from
false
appearances
he
is
the
person
hurt
since
he
too
is
the
person
deceived
for
if
anyone
takes
a
true
proposition
to
be
false
the
proposition
is
not
hurt
but
only
the
man
is
deceived
setting
out
then
from
these
principles
you
will
meekly
bear
with
a
person
who
reviles
you
for
you
will
say
upon
every
occasion
it
seemed
so
to
xliii
everything
has
two
handles
one
by
which
it
may
be
borne
another
by
which
it
can
not
if
your
brother
acts
unjustly
do
not
lay
hold
on
the
affair
by
the
handle
of
his
injustice
for
by
that
it
can
not
be
borne
but
rather
by
the
he
is
your
brother
that
he
was
brought
up
with
you
and
thus
you
will
lay
hold
on
it
as
it
is
to
be
borne
xliv
these
reasonings
have
no
logical
connection
i
am
richer
than
you
therefore
i
am
your
i
am
more
eloquent
than
you
therefore
i
am
your
the
true
logical
connection
is
rather
this
i
am
richer
than
you
therefore
my
possessions
must
exceed
i
am
more
eloquent
than
you
therefore
my
style
must
surpass
but
you
after
all
consist
neither
in
property
nor
in
style
xlv
does
anyone
bathe
hastily
do
not
say
that
he
does
it
ill
but
hastily
does
anyone
drink
much
wine
do
not
say
that
he
does
ill
but
that
he
drinks
a
great
deal
for
unless
you
perfectly
understand
his
motives
how
should
you
know
if
he
acts
ill
thus
you
will
not
risk
yielding
to
any
appearances
but
such
as
you
fully
comprehend
xlvi
never
proclaim
yourself
a
philosopher
nor
make
much
talk
among
the
ignorant
about
your
principles
but
show
them
by
actions
thus
at
an
entertainment
do
not
discourse
how
people
ought
to
eat
but
eat
as
you
ought
for
remember
that
thus
socrates
also
universally
avoided
all
ostentation
and
when
persons
came
to
him
and
desired
to
be
introduced
by
him
to
philosophers
he
took
them
and
introduced
them
so
well
did
he
bear
being
overlooked
so
if
ever
there
should
be
among
the
ignorant
any
discussion
of
principles
be
for
the
most
part
silent
for
there
is
great
danger
in
hastily
throwing
out
what
is
undigested
and
if
anyone
tells
you
that
you
know
nothing
and
you
are
not
nettled
at
it
then
you
may
be
sure
that
you
have
really
entered
on
your
work
for
sheep
do
not
hastily
throw
up
the
grass
to
show
the
shepherds
how
much
they
have
eaten
but
inwardly
digesting
their
food
they
produce
it
outwardly
in
wool
and
milk
thus
therefore
do
you
not
make
an
exhibition
before
the
ignorant
of
your
principles
but
of
the
actions
to
which
their
digestion
gives
rise
xlvii
when
you
have
learned
to
nourish
your
body
frugally
do
not
pique
yourself
upon
it
nor
if
you
drink
water
be
saying
upon
every
occasion
i
drink
but
first
consider
how
much
more
frugal
are
the
poor
than
we
and
how
much
more
patient
of
hardship
if
at
any
time
you
would
inure
yourself
by
exercise
to
labor
and
privation
for
your
own
sake
and
not
for
the
public
do
not
attempt
great
feats
but
when
you
are
violently
thirsty
just
rinse
your
mouth
with
water
and
tell
nobody
xlviii
the
condition
and
characteristic
of
a
vulgar
person
is
that
he
never
looks
for
either
help
or
harm
from
himself
but
only
from
externals
the
condition
and
characteristic
of
a
philosopher
is
that
he
looks
to
himself
for
all
help
or
harm
the
marks
of
a
proficient
are
that
he
censures
no
one
praises
no
one
blames
no
one
accuses
no
one
says
nothing
concerning
himself
as
being
anybody
or
knowing
anything
when
he
is
in
any
instance
hindered
or
restrained
he
accuses
himself
and
if
he
is
praised
he
smiles
to
himself
at
the
person
who
praises
him
and
if
he
is
censured
he
makes
no
defense
but
he
goes
about
with
the
caution
of
a
convalescent
careful
of
interference
with
anything
that
is
doing
well
but
not
yet
quite
secure
he
restrains
desire
he
transfers
his
aversion
to
those
things
only
which
thwart
the
proper
use
of
our
own
will
he
employs
his
energies
moderately
in
all
directions
if
he
appears
stupid
or
ignorant
he
does
not
care
and
in
a
word
he
keeps
watch
over
himself
as
over
an
enemy
and
one
in
ambush
xlix
when
anyone
shows
himself
vain
on
being
able
to
understand
and
interpret
the
works
of
chrysippus
say
to
yourself
unless
chrysippus
had
written
obscurely
this
person
would
have
had
nothing
to
be
vain
of
but
what
do
i
desire
to
understand
nature
and
follow
her
i
ask
then
who
interprets
her
and
hearing
that
chrysippus
does
i
have
recourse
to
him
i
do
not
understand
his
writings
i
seek
therefore
one
to
interpret
so
far
there
is
nothing
to
value
myself
upon
and
when
i
find
an
interpreter
what
remains
is
to
make
use
of
his
instructions
this
alone
is
the
valuable
thing
but
if
i
admire
merely
the
interpretation
what
do
i
become
more
than
a
grammarian
instead
of
a
philosopher
except
indeed
that
instead
of
homer
i
interpret
chrysippus
when
anyone
therefore
desires
me
to
read
chrysippus
to
him
i
rather
blush
when
i
can
not
exhibit
actions
that
are
harmonious
and
consonant
with
his
discourse
l
whatever
rules
you
have
adopted
abide
by
them
as
laws
and
as
if
you
would
be
impious
to
transgress
them
and
do
not
regard
what
anyone
says
of
you
for
this
after
all
is
no
concern
of
yours
how
long
then
will
you
delay
to
demand
of
yourself
the
noblest
improvements
and
in
no
instance
to
transgress
the
judgments
of
reason
you
have
received
the
philosophic
principles
with
which
you
ought
to
be
conversant
and
you
have
been
conversant
with
them
for
what
other
master
then
do
you
wait
as
an
excuse
for
this
delay
in
you
are
no
longer
a
boy
but
a
grown
man
if
therefore
you
will
be
negligent
and
slothful
and
always
add
procrastination
to
procrastination
purpose
to
purpose
and
fix
day
after
day
in
which
you
will
attend
to
yourself
you
will
insensibly
continue
to
accomplish
nothing
and
living
and
dying
remain
of
vulgar
mind
this
instant
then
think
yourself
worthy
of
living
as
a
man
grown
up
and
a
proficient
let
whatever
appears
to
be
the
best
be
to
you
an
inviolable
law
and
if
any
instance
of
pain
or
pleasure
glory
or
disgrace
be
set
before
you
remember
that
now
is
the
combat
now
the
olympiad
comes
on
nor
can
it
be
put
off
and
that
by
one
failure
and
defeat
honor
may
be
lost
thus
socrates
became
perfect
improving
himself
by
everything
following
reason
alone
and
though
you
are
not
yet
a
socrates
you
ought
however
to
live
as
one
seeking
to
be
a
socrates
li
the
first
and
most
necessary
topic
in
philosophy
is
the
practical
application
of
principles
as
ought
not
to
the
second
is
that
of
demonstrations
as
it
is
that
we
ought
not
to
the
third
that
which
gives
strength
and
logical
connection
to
the
other
two
as
this
is
a
for
what
is
demonstration
what
is
a
consequence
what
a
contradiction
what
truth
what
falsehood
the
third
point
is
then
necessary
on
account
of
the
second
and
the
second
on
account
of
the
first
but
the
most
necessary
and
that
whereon
we
ought
to
rest
is
the
first
but
we
do
just
the
contrary
for
we
spend
all
our
time
on
the
third
point
and
employ
all
our
diligence
about
that
and
entirely
neglect
the
first
therefore
at
the
same
time
that
we
lie
we
are
very
ready
to
show
how
it
is
demonstrated
that
lying
is
wrong
upon
all
occasions
we
ought
to
have
these
maxims
ready
at
hand
conduct
me
zeus
and
thou
o
destiny
wherever
your
decrees
have
fixed
my
lot
i
follow
cheerfully
and
did
i
not
wicked
and
wretched
i
must
follow
still
who
er
yields
properly
to
fate
is
deemed
wise
among
men
and
knows
the
laws
of
heaven
and
this
third
o
crito
if
it
thus
pleases
the
gods
thus
let
it
anytus
and
melitus
may
kill
me
indeed
but
hurt
me
they
can
not
footnotes
happiness
the
effect
of
virtue
is
the
mark
which
god
has
set
up
for
us
to
aim
at
our
missing
it
is
no
work
of
his
nor
so
properly
anything
real
as
a
mere
negative
and
failure
of
our
own
chapter
xv
of
the
third
book
of
the
which
with
the
exception
of
some
very
trifling
differences
is
the
same
as
chapter
xxix
of
the
euphrates

a
philosopher
of
syria
whose
character
is
described

encomiums

pliny
