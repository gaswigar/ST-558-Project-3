preface
i
have
often
been
asked
to
write
my
life
as
those
who
know
me
know
that
it
has
been
an
eventful
one
at
last
i
have
acceded
to
the
importunities
of
my
friends
and
have
hastily
sketched
some
of
the
striking
incidents
that
go
to
make
up
my
history
my
life
so
full
of
romance
may
sound
like
a
dream
to
the
reader
nevertheless
everything
i
have
written
is
strictly
true
much
has
been
omitted
but
nothing
has
been
exaggerated
in
writing
as
i
have
done
i
am
well
aware
that
i
have
invited
criticism
but
before
the
critic
judges
harshly
let
my
explanation
be
carefully
read
and
weighed
if
i
have
portrayed
the
dark
side
of
slavery
i
also
have
painted
the
bright
side
the
good
that
i
have
said
of
human
servitude
should
be
thrown
into
the
scales
with
the
evil
that
i
have
said
of
it
i
have
kind
friends
in
the
south
as
well
as
in
the
north
and
i
would
not
wound
those
southern
friends
by
sweeping
condemnation
simply
because
i
was
once
a
slave
they
were
not
so
much
responsible
for
the
curse
under
which
i
was
born
as
the
god
of
nature
and
the
fathers
who
framed
the
constitution
for
the
united
states
the
law
descended
to
them
and
it
was
but
natural
that
they
should
recognize
it
since
it
manifestly
was
their
interest
to
do
so
and
yet
a
wrong
was
inflicted
upon
me
a
cruel
custom
deprived
me
of
my
liberty
and
since
i
was
robbed
of
my
dearest
right
i
would
not
have
been
human
had
i
not
rebelled
against
the
robbery
god
rules
the
universe
i
was
a
feeble
instrument
in
his
hands
and
through
me
and
the
enslaved
millions
of
my
race
one
of
the
problems
was
solved
that
belongs
to
the
great
problem
of
human
destiny
and
the
solution
was
developed
so
gradually
that
there
was
no
great
convulsion
of
the
harmonies
of
natural
laws
a
solemn
truth
was
thrown
to
the
surface
and
what
is
better
still
it
was
recognized
as
a
truth
by
those
who
give
force
to
moral
laws
an
act
may
be
wrong
but
unless
the
ruling
power
recognizes
the
wrong
it
is
useless
to
hope
for
a
correction
of
it
principles
may
be
right
but
they
are
not
established
within
an
hour
the
masses
are
slow
to
reason
and
each
principle
to
acquire
moral
force
must
come
to
us
from
the
fire
of
the
crucible
the
fire
may
inflict
unjust
punishment
but
then
it
purifies
and
renders
stronger
the
principle
not
in
itself
but
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
arrogate
judgment
to
themselves
when
the
war
of
the
revolution
established
the
independence
of
the
american
colonies
an
evil
was
perpetuated
slavery
was
more
firmly
established
and
since
the
evil
had
been
planted
it
must
pass
through
certain
stages
before
it
could
be
eradicated
in
fact
we
give
but
little
thought
to
the
plant
of
evil
until
it
grows
to
such
monstrous
proportions
that
it
overshadows
important
interests
then
the
efforts
to
destroy
it
become
earnest
as
one
of
the
victims
of
slavery
i
drank
of
the
bitter
water
but
then
since
destiny
willed
it
so
and
since
i
aided
in
bringing
a
solemn
truth
to
the
surface
a
perhaps
i
have
no
right
to
complain
here
as
in
all
things
pertaining
to
life
i
can
afford
to
be
charitable
it
may
be
charged
that
i
have
written
too
freely
on
some
questions
especially
in
regard
to
lincoln
i
do
not
think
so
at
least
i
have
been
prompted
by
the
purest
motive
lincoln
by
her
own
acts
forced
herself
into
notoriety
she
stepped
beyond
the
formal
lines
which
hedge
about
a
private
life
and
invited
public
criticism
the
people
have
judged
her
harshly
and
no
woman
was
ever
more
traduced
in
the
public
prints
of
the
country
the
people
knew
nothing
of
the
secret
history
of
her
transactions
therefore
they
judged
her
by
what
was
thrown
to
the
surface
for
an
act
may
be
wrong
judged
purely
by
itself
but
when
the
motive
that
prompted
the
act
is
understood
it
is
construed
differently
i
lay
it
down
as
an
axiom
that
only
that
is
criminal
in
the
sight
of
god
where
crime
is
meditated
lincoln
may
have
been
imprudent
but
since
her
intentions
were
good
she
should
be
judged
more
kindly
than
she
has
been
but
the
world
do
not
know
what
her
intentions
were
they
have
only
been
made
acquainted
with
her
acts
without
knowing
what
feeling
guided
her
actions
if
the
world
are
to
judge
her
as
i
have
judged
her
they
must
be
introduced
to
the
secret
history
of
her
transactions
the
veil
of
mystery
must
be
drawn
aside
the
origin
of
a
fact
must
be
brought
to
light
with
the
naked
fact
itself
if
i
have
betrayed
confidence
in
anything
i
have
published
it
has
been
to
place
lincoln
in
a
better
light
before
the
world
a
breach
of
trust
if
breach
it
can
be
called
of
this
kind
is
always
excusable
my
own
character
as
well
as
the
character
of
lincoln
is
at
stake
since
i
have
been
intimately
associated
with
that
lady
in
the
most
eventful
periods
of
her
life
i
have
been
her
confidante
and
if
evil
charges
are
laid
at
her
door
they
also
must
be
laid
at
mine
since
i
have
been
a
party
to
all
her
movements
to
defend
myself
i
must
defend
the
lady
that
i
have
served
the
world
have
judged
lincoln
by
the
facts
which
float
upon
the
surface
and
through
her
have
partially
judged
me
and
the
only
way
to
convince
them
that
wrong
was
not
meditated
is
to
explain
the
motives
that
actuated
us
i
have
written
nothing
that
can
place
lincoln
in
a
worse
light
before
the
world
than
the
light
in
which
she
now
stands
therefore
the
secret
history
that
i
publish
can
do
her
no
harm
i
have
excluded
everything
of
a
personal
character
from
her
letters
the
extracts
introduced
only
refer
to
public
men
and
are
such
as
to
throw
light
upon
her
unfortunate
adventure
in
new
york
these
letters
were
not
written
for
publication
for
which
reason
they
are
all
the
more
valuable
they
are
the
frank
overflowings
of
the
heart
the
outcropping
of
impulse
the
key
to
genuine
motives
they
prove
the
motive
to
have
been
pure
and
if
they
shall
help
to
stifle
the
voice
of
calumny
i
am
content
i
do
not
forget
before
the
public
journals
vilified
lincoln
that
ladies
who
moved
in
the
washington
circle
in
which
she
moved
freely
canvassed
her
character
among
themselves
they
gloated
over
many
a
tale
of
scandal
that
grew
out
of
gossip
in
their
own
circle
if
these
ladies
could
say
everything
bad
of
the
wife
of
the
president
why
should
i
not
be
permitted
to
lay
her
secret
history
bare
especially
when
that
history
plainly
shows
that
her
life
like
all
lives
has
its
good
side
as
well
as
its
bad
side
none
of
us
are
perfect
for
which
reason
we
should
heed
the
voice
of
charity
when
it
whispers
in
our
ears
do
not
magnify
the
imperfections
of
others
had
lincoln
acts
never
become
public
property
i
should
not
have
published
to
the
world
the
secret
chapters
of
her
life
i
am
not
the
special
champion
of
the
widow
of
our
lamented
president
the
reader
of
the
pages
which
follow
will
discover
that
i
have
written
with
the
utmost
frankness
in
regard
to
her
have
exposed
her
faults
as
well
as
given
her
credit
for
honest
motives
i
wish
the
world
to
judge
her
as
she
is
free
from
the
exaggerations
of
praise
or
scandal
since
i
have
been
associated
with
her
in
so
many
things
that
have
provoked
hostile
criticism
and
the
judgment
that
the
world
may
pass
upon
her
i
flatter
myself
will
present
my
own
actions
in
a
better
light

chapter
i
where
i
was
born
my
life
has
been
an
eventful
one
i
was
born
a
slave
was
the
child
of
slave
parents
therefore
i
came
upon
the
earth
free
in
thought
but
fettered
in
action
my
birthplace
was
dinwiddie
in
virginia
my
recollections
of
childhood
are
distinct
perhaps
for
the
reason
that
many
stirring
incidents
are
associated
with
that
period
i
am
now
on
the
shady
side
of
forty
and
as
i
sit
alone
in
my
room
the
brain
is
busy
and
a
rapidly
moving
panorama
brings
scene
after
scene
before
me
some
pleasant
and
others
sad
and
when
i
thus
greet
old
familiar
faces
i
often
find
myself
wondering
if
i
am
not
living
the
past
over
again
the
visions
are
so
terribly
distinct
that
i
almost
imagine
them
to
be
real
hour
after
hour
i
sit
while
the
scenes
are
being
shifted
and
as
i
gaze
upon
the
panorama
of
the
past
i
realize
how
crowded
with
incidents
my
life
has
been
every
day
seems
like
a
romance
within
itself
and
the
years
grow
into
ponderous
volumes
as
i
can
not
condense
i
must
omit
many
strange
passages
in
my
history
from
such
a
wilderness
of
events
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
selection
but
as
i
am
not
writing
altogether
the
history
of
myself
i
will
confine
my
story
to
the
most
important
incidents
which
i
believe
influenced
the
moulding
of
my
character
as
i
glance
over
the
crowded
sea
of
the
past
these
incidents
stand
forth
prominently
the
of
memory
i
presume
that
i
must
have
been
four
years
old
when
i
first
began
to
remember
at
least
i
can
not
now
recall
anything
occurring
previous
to
this
period
my
master
burwell
was
somewhat
unsettled
in
his
business
affairs
and
while
i
was
yet
an
infant
he
made
several
removals
while
living
at
hampton
sidney
college
prince
edward
county
burwell
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
a
sweet
baby
my
earliest
and
fondest
pet
to
take
care
of
this
baby
was
my
first
duty
true
i
was
but
a
child
myself
only
four
years
old
but
then
i
had
been
raised
in
a
hardy
school
had
been
taught
to
rely
upon
myself
and
to
prepare
myself
to
render
assistance
to
others
the
lesson
was
not
a
bitter
one
for
i
was
too
young
to
indulge
in
philosophy
and
the
precepts
that
i
then
treasured
and
practised
i
believe
developed
those
principles
of
character
which
have
enabled
me
to
triumph
over
so
many
difficulties
notwithstanding
all
the
wrongs
that
slavery
heaped
upon
me
i
can
bless
it
for
one
thing
youth
important
lesson
of
the
baby
was
named
elizabeth
and
it
was
pleasant
to
me
to
be
assigned
a
duty
in
connection
with
it
for
the
discharge
of
that
duty
transferred
me
from
the
rude
cabin
to
the
household
of
my
master
my
simple
attire
was
a
short
dress
and
a
little
white
apron
my
old
mistress
encouraged
me
in
rocking
the
cradle
by
telling
me
that
if
i
would
watch
over
the
baby
well
keep
the
flies
out
of
its
face
and
not
let
it
cry
i
should
be
its
little
maid
this
was
a
golden
promise
and
i
required
no
better
inducement
for
the
faithful
performance
of
my
task
i
began
to
rock
the
cradle
most
industriously
when
lo
out
pitched
little
pet
on
the
floor
i
instantly
cried
out
oh
the
baby
is
on
the
floor
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
i
seized
the
in
my
perplexity
and
was
trying
to
shovel
up
my
tender
charge
when
my
mistress
called
to
me
to
let
the
child
alone
and
then
ordered
that
i
be
taken
out
and
lashed
for
my
carelessness
the
blows
were
not
administered
with
a
light
hand
i
assure
you
and
doubtless
the
severity
of
the
lashing
has
made
me
remember
the
incident
so
well
this
was
the
first
time
i
was
punished
in
this
cruel
way
but
not
the
last
the
baby
that
i
called
my
pet
grew
into
a
girl
and
in
after
years
was
the
cause
of
much
trouble
to
me
i
grew
strong
and
healthy
and
notwithstanding
i
knit
socks
and
attended
to
various
kinds
of
work
i
was
repeatedly
told
when
even
fourteen
years
old
that
i
would
never
be
worth
my
salt
when
i
was
eight
burwell
family
consisted
of
six
sons
and
four
daughters
with
a
large
family
of
servants
my
mother
was
kind
and
forbearing
burwell
a
hard
and
as
mother
had
so
much
work
to
do
in
making
clothes
for
the
family
besides
the
slaves
i
determined
to
render
her
all
the
assistance
in
my
power
and
in
rendering
her
such
assistance
my
young
energies
were
taxed
to
the
utmost
i
was
my
mother
only
child
which
made
her
love
for
me
all
the
stronger
i
did
not
know
much
of
my
father
for
he
was
the
slave
of
another
man
and
when
burwell
moved
from
dinwiddie
he
was
separated
from
us
and
only
allowed
to
visit
my
mother
twice
a
year
during
the
easter
holidays
and
christmas
at
last
burwell
determined
to
reward
my
mother
by
making
an
arrangement
with
the
owner
of
my
father
by
which
the
separation
of
my
parents
could
be
brought
to
an
end
it
was
a
bright
day
indeed
for
my
mother
when
it
was
announced
that
my
father
was
coming
to
live
with
us
the
old
weary
look
faded
from
her
face
and
she
worked
as
if
her
heart
was
in
every
task
but
the
golden
days
did
not
last
long
the
radiant
dream
faded
all
too
soon
in
the
morning
my
father
called
me
to
him
and
kissed
me
then
held
me
out
at
arms
length
as
if
he
were
regarding
his
child
with
pride
she
is
growing
into
a
large
fine
girl
he
remarked
to
my
mother
i
dun
no
which
i
like
best
you
or
lizzie
as
both
are
so
dear
to
me
my
mother
name
was
agnes
and
my
father
delighted
to
call
me
his
little
lizzie
while
yet
my
father
and
mother
were
speaking
hopefully
joyfully
of
the
future
burwell
came
to
the
cabin
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
he
was
a
kind
master
in
some
things
and
as
gently
as
possible
informed
my
parents
that
they
must
part
for
in
two
hours
my
father
must
join
his
master
at
dinwiddie
and
go
with
him
to
the
west
where
he
had
determined
to
make
his
future
home
the
announcement
fell
upon
the
little
circle
in
that
cabin
like
a
thunderbolt
i
can
remember
the
scene
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
how
my
father
cried
out
against
the
cruel
separation
his
last
kiss
his
wild
straining
of
my
mother
to
his
bosom
the
solemn
prayer
to
heaven
the
tears
and
sobs
the
fearful
anguish
of
broken
hearts
the
last
kiss
the
last
and
he
my
father
was
gone
gone
forever
the
shadow
eclipsed
the
sunshine
and
love
brought
despair
the
parting
was
eternal
the
cloud
had
no
silver
lining
but
i
trust
that
it
will
be
all
silver
in
heaven
we
who
are
crushed
to
earth
with
heavy
chains
who
travel
a
weary
rugged
thorny
road
groping
through
midnight
darkness
on
earth
earn
our
right
to
enjoy
the
sunshine
in
the
great
hereafter
at
the
grave
at
least
we
should
be
permitted
to
lay
our
burdens
down
that
a
new
world
a
world
of
brightness
may
open
to
us
the
light
that
is
denied
us
here
should
grow
into
a
flood
of
effulgence
beyond
the
dark
mysterious
shadows
of
death
deep
as
was
the
distress
of
my
mother
in
parting
with
my
father
her
sorrow
did
not
screen
her
from
insult
my
old
mistress
said
to
her
stop
your
nonsense
there
is
no
necessity
for
you
putting
on
airs
your
husband
is
not
the
only
slave
that
has
been
sold
from
his
family
and
you
are
not
the
only
one
that
has
had
to
part
there
are
plenty
more
men
about
here
and
if
you
want
a
husband
so
badly
stop
your
crying
and
go
and
find
another
to
these
unfeeling
words
my
mother
made
no
reply
she
turned
away
in
stoical
silence
with
a
curl
of
that
loathing
scorn
upon
her
lips
which
swelled
in
her
heart
my
father
and
mother
never
met
again
in
this
world
they
kept
up
a
regular
correspondence
for
years
and
the
most
precious
mementoes
of
my
existence
are
the
faded
old
letters
that
he
wrote
full
of
love
and
always
hoping
that
the
future
would
bring
brighter
days
in
nearly
every
letter
is
a
message
for
me
tell
my
darling
little
lizzie
he
writes
to
be
a
good
girl
and
to
learn
her
book
kiss
her
for
me
and
tell
her
that
i
will
come
to
see
her
some
day
thus
he
wrote
time
and
again
but
he
never
came
he
lived
in
hope
but
died
without
ever
seeing
his
wife
and
child

george
pleasant
a
servant
of
the
last
letter
that
my
mother
received
from
my
father
was
dated
shelbyville
tennessee
march
he
writes
in
a
cheerful
strain
and
hopes
to
see
her
soon
alas
he
looked
forward
to
a
meeting
in
vain
year
after
year
the
one
great
hope
swelled
in
his
heart
but
the
hope
was
only
realized
beyond
the
dark
portals
of
the
grave
when
i
was
about
seven
years
old
i
witnessed
for
the
first
time
the
sale
of
a
human
being
we
were
living
at
prince
edward
in
virginia
and
master
had
just
purchased
his
hogs
for
the
winter
for
which
he
was
unable
to
pay
in
full
to
escape
from
his
embarrassment
it
was
necessary
to
sell
one
of
the
slaves
little
joe
the
son
of
the
cook
was
selected
as
the
victim
his
mother
was
ordered
to
dress
him
up
in
his
sunday
clothes
and
send
him
to
the
house
he
came
in
with
a
bright
face
was
placed
in
the
scales
and
was
sold
like
the
hogs
at
so
much
per
pound
his
mother
was
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
transaction
but
her
suspicions
were
aroused
when
her
son
started
for
petersburgh
in
the
wagon
the
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
her
mind
and
she
pleaded
piteously
that
her
boy
should
not
be
taken
from
her
but
master
quieted
her
by
telling
her
that
he
was
simply
going
to
town
with
the
wagon
and
would
be
back
in
the
morning
morning
came
but
little
joe
did
not
return
to
his
mother
morning
after
morning
passed
and
the
mother
went
down
to
the
grave
without
ever
seeing
her
child
again
one
day
she
was
whipped
for
grieving
for
her
lost
boy
colonel
burwell
never
liked
to
see
one
of
his
slaves
wear
a
sorrowful
face
and
those
who
offended
in
this
particular
way
were
always
punished
alas
the
sunny
face
of
the
slave
is
not
always
an
indication
of
sunshine
in
the
heart
colonel
burwell
at
one
time
owned
about
seventy
slaves
all
of
which
were
sold
and
in
a
majority
of
instances
wives
were
separated
from
husbands
and
children
from
their
parents
slavery
in
the
border
states
forty
years
ago
was
different
from
what
it
was
twenty
years
ago
time
seemed
to
soften
the
hearts
of
master
and
mistress
and
to
insure
kinder
and
more
humane
treatment
to
bondsmen
and
bondswomen
when
i
was
quite
a
child
an
incident
occurred
which
my
mother
afterward
impressed
more
strongly
on
my
mind
one
of
my
uncles
a
slave
of
colonel
burwell
lost
a
pair
of
ploughlines
and
when
the
loss
was
made
known
the
master
gave
him
a
new
pair
and
told
him
that
if
he
did
not
take
care
of
them
he
would
punish
him
severely
in
a
few
weeks
the
second
pair
of
lines
was
stolen
and
my
uncle
hung
himself
rather
than
meet
the
displeasure
of
his
master
my
mother
went
to
the
spring
in
the
morning
for
a
pail
of
water
and
on
looking
up
into
the
willow
tree
which
shaded
the
bubbling
crystal
stream
she
discovered
the
lifeless
form
of
her
brother
suspended
beneath
one
of
the
strong
branches
rather
than
be
punished
the
way
colonel
burwell
punished
his
servants
he
took
his
own
life
slavery
had
its
dark
side
as
well
as
its
bright
side
chapter
ii
girlhood
and
its
sorrows
i
must
pass
rapidly
over
the
stirring
events
of
my
early
life
when
i
was
about
fourteen
years
old
i
went
to
live
with
my
master
eldest
son
a
presbyterian
minister
his
salary
was
small
and
he
was
burdened
with
a
helpless
wife
a
girl
that
he
had
married
in
the
humble
walks
of
life
she
was
morbidly
sensitive
and
imagined
that
i
regarded
her
with
contemptuous
feelings
because
she
was
of
poor
parentage
i
was
their
only
servant
and
a
gracious
loan
at
that
they
were
not
able
to
buy
me
so
my
old
master
sought
to
render
them
assistance
by
allowing
them
the
benefit
of
my
services
from
the
very
first
i
did
the
work
of
three
servants
and
yet
i
was
scolded
and
regarded
with
distrust
the
years
passed
slowly
and
i
continued
to
serve
them
and
at
the
same
time
grew
into
strong
healthy
womanhood
i
was
nearly
eighteen
when
we
removed
from
virginia
to
hillsboro
north
carolina
where
young
burwell
took
charge
of
a
church
the
salary
was
small
and
we
still
had
to
practise
the
closest
economy
bingham
a
hard
cruel
man
the
village
schoolmaster
was
a
member
of
my
young
master
church
and
he
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
the
parsonage
she
whom
i
called
mistress
seemed
to
be
desirous
to
wreak
vengeance
on
me
for
something
and
bingham
became
her
ready
tool
during
this
time
my
master
was
unusually
kind
to
me
he
was
naturally
a
man
but
was
influenced
by
his
wife
it
was
saturday
evening
and
while
i
was
bending
over
the
bed
watching
the
baby
that
i
had
just
hushed
into
slumber
bingham
came
to
the
door
and
asked
me
to
go
with
him
to
his
study
wondering
what
he
meant
by
his
strange
request
i
followed
him
and
when
we
had
entered
the
study
he
closed
the
door
and
in
his
blunt
way
remarked
lizzie
i
am
going
to
flog
you
i
was
thunderstruck
and
tried
to
think
if
i
had
been
remiss
in
anything
i
could
not
recollect
of
doing
anything
to
deserve
punishment
and
with
surprise
exclaimed
whip
me
bingham
what
for
no
matter
he
replied
i
am
going
to
whip
you
so
take
down
your
dress
this
instant
recollect
i
was
eighteen
years
of
age
was
a
woman
fully
developed
and
yet
this
man
coolly
bade
me
take
down
my
dress
i
drew
myself
up
proudly
firmly
and
said
no
bingham
i
shall
not
take
down
my
dress
before
you
moreover
you
shall
not
whip
me
unless
you
prove
the
stronger
nobody
has
a
right
to
whip
me
but
my
own
master
and
nobody
shall
do
so
if
i
can
prevent
it
my
words
seemed
to
exasperate
him
he
seized
a
rope
caught
me
roughly
and
tried
to
tie
me
i
resisted
with
all
my
strength
but
he
was
the
stronger
of
the
two
and
after
a
hard
struggle
succeeded
in
binding
my
hands
and
tearing
my
dress
from
my
back
then
he
picked
up
a
rawhide
and
began
to
ply
it
freely
over
my
shoulders
with
steady
hand
and
practised
eye
he
would
raise
the
instrument
of
torture
nerve
himself
for
a
blow
and
with
fearful
force
the
rawhide
descended
upon
the
quivering
flesh
it
cut
the
skin
raised
great
welts
and
the
warm
blood
trickled
down
my
back
oh
god
i
can
feel
the
torture
now
the
terrible
excruciating
agony
of
those
moments
i
did
not
scream
i
was
too
proud
to
let
my
tormentor
know
what
i
was
suffering
i
closed
my
lips
firmly
that
not
even
a
groan
might
escape
from
them
and
i
stood
like
a
statue
while
the
keen
lash
cut
deep
into
my
flesh
as
soon
as
i
was
released
stunned
with
pain
bruised
and
bleeding
i
went
home
and
rushed
into
the
presence
of
the
pastor
and
his
wife
wildly
exclaiming
master
robert
why
did
you
let
bingham
flog
me
what
have
i
done
that
i
should
be
so
punished
go
away
he
gruffly
answered
do
not
bother
me
i
would
not
be
put
off
thus
what
i
done
i
know
why
i
have
been
flogged
i
saw
his
cheeks
flush
with
anger
but
i
did
not
move
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
on
my
refusing
to
go
without
an
explanation
seized
a
chair
struck
me
and
felled
me
to
the
floor
i
rose
bewildered
almost
dead
with
pain
crept
to
my
room
dressed
my
bruised
arms
and
back
as
best
i
could
and
then
lay
down
but
not
to
sleep
no
i
could
not
sleep
for
i
was
suffering
mental
as
well
as
bodily
torture
my
spirit
rebelled
against
the
unjustness
that
had
been
inflicted
upon
me
and
though
i
tried
to
smother
my
anger
and
to
forgive
those
who
had
been
so
cruel
to
me
it
was
impossible
the
next
morning
i
was
more
calm
and
i
believe
that
i
could
then
have
forgiven
everything
for
the
sake
of
one
kind
word
but
the
kind
word
was
not
proffered
and
it
may
be
possible
that
i
grew
somewhat
wayward
and
sullen
though
i
had
faults
i
know
now
as
i
felt
then
harshness
was
the
poorest
inducement
for
the
correction
of
them
it
seems
that
bingham
had
pledged
himself
to
burwell
to
subdue
what
he
called
my
stubborn
pride
on
friday
following
the
saturday
on
which
i
was
so
savagely
beaten
bingham
again
directed
me
come
to
his
study
i
went
but
with
the
determination
to
offer
resistance
should
he
attempt
to
flog
me
again
on
entering
the
room
i
found
him
prepared
with
a
new
rope
and
a
new
cowhide
i
told
him
that
i
was
ready
to
die
but
that
he
could
not
conquer
me
in
struggling
with
him
i
bit
his
finger
severely
when
he
seized
a
heavy
stick
and
beat
me
with
it
in
a
shameful
manner
again
i
went
home
sore
and
bleeding
but
with
pride
as
strong
and
defiant
as
ever
the
following
thursday
bingham
again
tried
to
conquer
me
but
in
vain
we
struggled
and
he
struck
me
many
savage
blows
as
i
stood
bleeding
before
him
nearly
exhausted
with
his
efforts
he
burst
into
tears
and
declared
that
it
would
be
a
sin
to
beat
me
any
more
my
suffering
at
last
subdued
his
hard
heart
he
asked
my
forgiveness
and
afterwards
was
an
altered
man
he
was
never
known
to
strike
one
of
his
servants
from
that
day
forward
burwell
he
who
preached
the
love
of
heaven
who
glorified
the
precepts
and
examples
of
christ
who
expounded
the
holy
scriptures
sabbath
after
sabbath
from
the
pulpit
when
bingham
refused
to
whip
me
any
more
was
urged
by
his
wife
to
punish
me
himself
one
morning
he
went
to
the
took
an
oak
broom
cut
the
handle
off
and
with
this
heavy
handle
attempted
to
conquer
me
i
fought
him
but
he
proved
the
strongest
at
the
sight
of
my
bleeding
form
his
wife
fell
upon
her
knees
and
begged
him
to
desist
my
distress
even
touched
her
cold
jealous
heart
i
was
so
badly
bruised
that
i
was
unable
to
leave
my
bed
for
five
days
i
will
not
dwell
upon
the
bitter
anguish
of
these
hours
for
even
the
thought
of
them
now
makes
me
shudder
the
rev
burwell
was
not
yet
satisfied
he
resolved
to
make
another
attempt
to
subdue
my
proud
rebellious
spirit
made
the
attempt
and
again
failed
when
he
told
me
with
an
air
of
penitence
that
he
should
never
strike
me
another
blow
and
faithfully
he
kept
his
word
these
revolting
scenes
created
a
great
sensation
at
the
time
were
the
talk
of
the
town
and
neighborhood
and
i
flatter
myself
that
the
actions
of
those
who
had
conspired
against
me
were
not
viewed
in
a
light
to
reflect
much
credit
upon
them
the
savage
efforts
to
subdue
my
pride
were
not
the
only
things
that
brought
me
suffering
and
deep
mortification
during
my
residence
at
hillsboro
i
was
regarded
as
for
one
of
my
race
and
for
four
years
a
white
man
i
spare
the
world
his
name
had
base
designs
upon
me
i
do
not
care
to
dwell
upon
this
subject
for
it
is
one
that
is
fraught
with
pain
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
persecuted
me
for
four
years
and
i
i
became
a
mother
the
child
of
which
he
was
the
father
was
the
only
child
that
i
ever
brought
into
the
world
if
my
poor
boy
ever
suffered
any
humiliating
pangs
on
account
of
birth
he
could
not
blame
his
mother
for
god
knows
that
she
did
not
wish
to
give
him
life
he
must
blame
the
edicts
of
that
society
which
deemed
it
no
crime
to
undermine
the
virtue
of
girls
in
my
then
position
among
the
old
letters
preserved
by
my
mother
i
find
the
following
written
by
myself
while
at
hillsboro
in
this
connection
i
desire
to
state
that
rev
robert
burwell
is
now
living
a
at
charlotte
north
carolina
hillsboro
april
my
dear
mother
i
have
been
intending
to
write
to
you
for
a
long
time
but
numerous
things
have
prevented
and
for
that
reason
you
must
excuse
me
i
thought
very
hard
of
you
for
not
writing
to
me
but
hope
that
you
will
answer
this
letter
as
soon
as
you
receive
it
and
tell
me
how
you
like
marsfield
and
if
you
have
seen
any
of
old
acquaintances
or
if
you
yet
know
any
of
the
people
who
i
think
so
much
of
i
want
to
hear
of
the
family
at
home
very
much
indeed
i
really
believe
you
and
all
the
family
have
forgotten
me
if
not
i
certainly
should
have
heard
from
some
of
you
since
you
left
boyton
if
it
was
only
a
line
nevertheless
i
love
you
all
very
dearly
and
shall
although
i
may
never
see
you
again
nor
do
i
ever
expect
to
miss
anna
is
going
to
petersburgh
next
winter
but
she
says
that
she
does
not
intend
take
me
what
reason
she
has
for
leaving
me
i
can
not
tell
i
have
often
wished
that
i
lived
where
i
knew
i
never
could
see
you
for
then
i
would
not
have
my
hopes
raised
and
to
be
disappointed
in
this
manner
however
it
is
said
that
a
bad
beginning
makes
a
good
ending
but
i
hardly
expect
to
see
that
happy
day
at
this
place
give
my
love
to
all
the
family
both
white
and
black
i
was
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
presents
you
sent
me
last
summer
though
it
is
quite
late
in
the
day
to
be
thanking
for
them
tell
aunt
bella
that
i
was
very
much
obliged
to
her
for
her
present
i
have
been
so
particular
with
it
that
i
have
only
worn
it
once
there
have
been
six
weddings
since
october
the
most
respectable
one
was
about
a
fortnight
ago
i
was
asked
to
be
the
first
attendant
but
as
usual
with
all
my
expectations
i
was
disappointed
for
on
the
i
felt
more
like
being
locked
up
in
a
box
than
attending
a
wedding
about
a
week
before
christmas
i
was
bridesmaid
for
ann
nash
when
the
night
came
i
was
in
quite
a
trouble
i
did
not
know
whether
my
frock
was
clean
or
dirty
i
only
had
a
week
notice
and
the
body
and
sleeves
to
make
and
only
one
hour
every
night
to
work
on
it
so
you
can
see
with
these
troubles
to
overcome
my
chance
was
rather
slim
i
must
now
close
although
i
could
fill
ten
pages
with
my
griefs
and
misfortunes
no
tongue
could
express
them
as
i
feel
forget
me
though
and
answer
my
letters
soon
i
will
write
you
again
and
would
write
more
now
but
miss
anna
says
it
is
time
i
had
finished
tell
miss
elizabeth
that
i
wish
she
would
make
haste
and
get
married
for
mistress
says
that
i
belong
to
her
when
she
gets
married
i
wish
you
would
send
me
a
pretty
frock
this
summer
if
you
will
send
it
to
robertson
miss
bet
will
send
it
to
me
farewell
darling
mother
your
affectionate
daughter

footnote
a

chapter
iii
how
i
gained
my
freedom
the
years
passed
and
brought
many
changes
to
me
but
on
these
i
will
not
dwell
as
i
wish
to
hasten
to
the
most
interesting
part
of
my
story
my
troubles
in
north
carolina
were
brought
to
an
end
by
my
unexpected
return
to
virginia
where
i
lived
with
garland
who
had
married
miss
ann
e
burwell
one
of
my
old
master
daughters
his
life
was
not
a
prosperous
one
and
after
struggling
with
the
world
for
several
years
he
left
his
native
state
a
disappointed
man
he
moved
to
louis
hoping
to
improve
his
fortune
in
the
west
but
ill
luck
followed
him
there
and
he
seemed
to
be
unable
to
escape
from
the
influence
of
the
evil
star
of
his
destiny
when
his
family
myself
included
joined
him
in
his
new
home
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
we
found
him
so
poor
that
he
was
unable
to
pay
the
dues
on
a
letter
advertised
as
in
the
for
him
the
necessities
of
the
family
were
so
great
that
it
was
proposed
to
place
my
mother
out
at
service
the
idea
was
shocking
to
me
every
gray
hair
in
her
old
head
was
dear
to
me
and
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
her
going
to
work
for
strangers
she
had
been
raised
in
the
family
had
watched
the
growth
of
each
child
from
infancy
to
maturity
they
had
been
the
objects
of
her
kindest
care
and
she
was
wound
round
about
them
as
the
vine
winds
itself
about
the
rugged
oak
they
had
been
the
central
figures
in
her
dream
of
life
a
dream
beautiful
to
her
since
she
had
basked
in
the
sunshine
of
no
other
and
now
they
proposed
to
destroy
each
tendril
of
affection
to
cloud
the
sunshine
of
her
existence
when
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
when
the
shadows
of
solemn
night
were
rapidly
approaching
my
mother
my
poor
aged
mother
go
among
strangers
to
toil
for
a
living
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
would
rather
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
bend
over
my
sewing
till
the
film
of
blindness
gathered
in
my
eyes
nay
even
beg
from
street
to
street
i
told
garland
so
and
he
gave
me
permission
to
see
what
i
could
do
i
was
fortunate
in
obtaining
work
and
in
a
short
time
i
had
acquired
something
of
a
reputation
as
a
seamstress
and
the
best
ladies
in
louis
were
my
patrons
and
when
my
reputation
was
once
established
i
never
lacked
for
orders
with
my
needle
i
kept
bread
in
the
mouths
of
seventeen
persons
for
two
years
and
five
months
while
i
was
working
so
hard
that
others
might
live
in
comparative
comfort
and
move
in
those
circles
of
society
to
which
their
birth
gave
them
entrance
the
thought
often
occurred
to
me
whether
i
was
really
worth
my
salt
or
not
and
then
perhaps
the
lips
curled
with
a
bitter
sneer
it
may
seem
strange
that
i
should
place
so
much
emphasis
upon
words
thoughtlessly
idly
spoken
but
then
we
do
many
strange
things
in
life
and
can
not
always
explain
the
motives
that
actuate
us
the
heavy
task
was
too
much
for
me
and
my
health
began
to
give
way
about
this
time
keckley
whom
i
had
met
in
virginia
and
learned
to
regard
with
more
than
friendship
came
to
louis
he
sought
my
hand
in
marriage
and
for
a
long
time
i
refused
to
consider
his
proposal
for
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
bringing
children
into
slavery
of
adding
one
single
recruit
to
the
millions
bound
to
hopeless
servitude
fettered
and
shackled
with
chains
stronger
and
heavier
than
manacles
of
iron
i
made
a
proposition
to
buy
myself
and
son
the
proposition
was
bluntly
declined
and
i
was
commanded
never
to
broach
the
subject
again
i
would
not
be
put
off
thus
for
hope
pointed
to
a
freer
brighter
life
in
the
future
why
should
my
son
be
held
in
slavery
i
often
asked
myself
he
came
into
the
world
through
no
will
of
mine
and
yet
god
only
knows
how
i
loved
him
the
blood
as
well
as
the
african
flowed
in
his
veins
the
two
currents
commingled
one
singing
of
freedom
the
other
silent
and
sullen
with
generations
of
despair
why
should
not
the
triumph
why
should
it
be
weighed
down
with
the
rich
blood
typical
of
the
tropics
must
the
of
one
race
bind
the
other
race
in
chains
as
strong
and
enduring
as
if
there
had
been
no
taint
by
the
laws
of
god
and
nature
as
interpreted
by
man
of
my
boy
was
free
and
why
should
not
this
fair
birthright
of
freedom
remove
the
curse
from
the
other
half
raise
it
into
the
bright
joyous
sunshine
of
liberty
i
could
not
answer
these
questions
of
my
heart
that
almost
maddened
me
and
i
learned
to
regard
human
philosophy
with
distrust
much
as
i
respected
the
authority
of
my
master
i
could
not
remain
silent
on
a
subject
that
so
nearly
concerned
me
one
day
when
i
insisted
on
knowing
whether
he
would
permit
me
to
purchase
myself
and
what
price
i
must
pay
for
myself
he
turned
to
me
in
a
petulant
manner
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
drew
forth
a
bright
silver
quarter
of
a
dollar
and
proffering
it
to
me
said
lizzie
i
have
told
you
often
not
to
trouble
me
with
such
a
question
if
you
really
wish
to
leave
me
take
this
it
will
pay
the
passage
of
yourself
and
boy
on
the
and
when
you
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
you
will
be
free
it
is
the
cheapest
way
that
i
know
of
to
accomplish
what
you
desire
i
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
and
earnestly
replied
no
master
i
do
not
wish
to
be
free
in
such
a
manner
if
such
had
been
my
wish
i
should
never
have
troubled
you
about
obtaining
your
consent
to
my
purchasing
myself
i
can
cross
the
river
any
day
as
you
well
know
and
have
frequently
done
so
but
will
never
leave
you
in
such
a
manner
by
the
laws
of
the
land
i
am
your
slave
you
are
my
master
and
i
will
only
be
free
by
such
means
as
the
laws
of
the
country
provide
he
expected
this
answer
and
i
knew
that
he
was
pleased
some
time
afterwards
he
told
me
that
he
had
reconsidered
the
question
that
i
had
served
his
family
faithfully
that
i
deserved
my
freedom
and
that
he
would
take
for
myself
and
boy
this
was
joyful
intelligence
for
me
and
the
reflection
of
hope
gave
a
silver
lining
to
the
dark
cloud
of
my
life
faint
it
is
true
but
still
a
silver
lining
taking
a
prospective
glance
at
liberty
i
consented
to
marry
the
wedding
was
a
great
event
in
the
family
the
ceremony
took
place
in
the
parlor
in
the
presence
of
the
family
and
a
number
of
guests
garland
gave
me
away
and
the
pastor
bishop
hawks
performed
the
ceremony
who
had
solemnized
the
bridals
of
own
children
the
day
was
a
happy
one
but
it
faded
all
too
soon
keckley
let
me
speak
kindly
of
his
faults
proved
dissipated
and
a
burden
instead
of
a
more
than
all
i
learned
that
he
was
a
slave
instead
of
a
free
man
as
he
represented
himself
to
be
with
the
simple
explanation
that
i
lived
with
him
eight
years
let
charity
draw
around
him
the
mantle
of
silence
i
went
to
work
in
earnest
to
purchase
my
freedom
but
the
years
passed
and
i
was
still
a
slave
garland
family
claimed
so
much
of
my
attention
in
fact
i
supported
them
that
i
was
not
able
to
accumulate
anything
in
the
mean
time
garland
died
and
burwell
a
mississippi
planter
came
to
louis
to
settle
up
the
estate
he
was
a
man
and
said
i
should
be
free
and
would
afford
me
every
facility
to
raise
the
necessary
amount
to
pay
the
price
of
my
liberty
several
schemes
were
urged
upon
me
by
my
friends
at
last
i
formed
a
resolution
to
go
to
new
york
state
my
case
and
appeal
to
the
benevolence
of
the
people
the
plan
seemed
feasible
and
i
made
preparations
to
carry
it
out
when
i
was
almost
ready
to
turn
my
face
northward
garland
told
me
that
she
would
require
the
names
of
six
gentlemen
who
would
vouch
for
my
return
and
become
responsible
for
the
amount
at
which
i
was
valued
i
had
many
friends
in
louis
and
as
i
believed
that
they
had
confidence
in
me
i
felt
that
i
could
readily
obtain
the
names
desired
i
started
out
stated
my
case
and
obtained
five
signatures
to
the
paper
and
my
heart
throbbed
with
pleasure
for
i
did
not
believe
that
the
sixth
would
refuse
me
i
called
he
listened
patiently
then
remarked
yes
yes
lizzie
the
scheme
is
a
fair
one
and
you
shall
have
my
name
but
i
shall
bid
you
when
you
start
for
a
short
time
i
ventured
to
add
no
for
all
time
and
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
would
read
my
very
soul
with
his
eyes
i
was
startled
what
do
you
mean
farrow
surely
you
do
not
think
that
i
do
not
mean
to
come
back
no
no
what
then
simply
this
you
to
come
back
that
is
you
so
but
you
never
will
when
you
reach
new
york
the
abolitionists
will
tell
you
what
savages
we
are
and
they
will
prevail
on
you
to
stay
there
and
we
shall
never
see
you
again
but
i
assure
you
farrow
you
are
mistaken
i
not
only
to
come
back
but
come
back
and
pay
every
cent
of
the
twelve
hundred
dollars
for
myself
and
child
i
was
beginning
to
feel
sick
at
heart
for
i
could
not
accept
the
signature
of
this
man
when
he
had
no
faith
in
my
pledges
no
slavery
eternal
slavery
rather
than
be
regarded
with
distrust
by
those
whose
respect
i
esteemed
but
i
am
not
mistaken
he
persisted
time
will
show
when
you
start
for
the
north
i
shall
bid
you
the
heart
grew
heavy
every
ray
of
sunshine
was
eclipsed
with
humbled
pride
weary
step
tearful
face
and
a
dull
aching
pain
i
left
the
house
i
walked
along
the
street
mechanically
the
cloud
had
no
silver
lining
now
the
rosebuds
of
hope
had
withered
and
died
without
lifting
up
their
heads
to
receive
the
dew
kiss
of
morning
there
was
no
morning
for
me
all
was
night
dark
night
i
reached
my
own
home
and
weeping
threw
myself
upon
the
bed
my
trunk
was
packed
my
luncheon
was
prepared
by
mother
the
cars
were
ready
to
bear
me
where
i
would
not
hear
the
clank
of
chains
where
i
would
breathe
the
free
invigorating
breezes
of
the
glorious
north
i
had
dreamed
such
a
happy
dream
in
imagination
had
drunk
of
the
water
the
pure
sweet
crystal
water
of
life
but
now
now
the
flowers
had
withered
before
my
eyes
darkness
had
settled
down
upon
me
like
a
pall
and
i
was
left
alone
with
cruel
mocking
shadows
the
first
paroxysm
of
grief
was
scarcely
over
when
a
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
mrs
le
bourgois
one
of
my
kind
patrons
got
out
of
it
and
entered
the
door
she
seemed
to
bring
sunshine
with
her
handsome
cheery
face
she
came
to
where
i
was
and
in
her
sweet
way
said
lizzie
i
hear
that
you
are
going
to
new
york
to
beg
for
money
to
buy
your
freedom
i
have
been
thinking
over
the
matter
and
told
ma
it
would
be
a
shame
to
allow
you
to
go
north
to
for
what
we
should
you
you
have
many
friends
in
louis
and
i
am
going
to
raise
the
twelve
hundred
dollars
required
among
them
i
have
two
hundred
dollars
put
away
for
a
present
am
indebted
to
you
one
hundred
dollars
mother
owes
you
fifty
dollars
and
will
add
another
fifty
to
it
and
as
i
do
not
want
the
present
i
will
make
the
money
a
present
to
you
start
for
new
york
now
until
i
see
what
i
can
do
among
your
friends
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
she
came
and
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
she
went
away
the
flowers
no
longer
were
withered
drooping
again
they
seemed
to
bud
and
grow
in
fragrance
and
beauty
mrs
le
bourgois
god
bless
her
dear
good
heart
was
more
than
successful
the
twelve
hundred
dollars
were
raised
and
at
last
my
son
and
myself
were
free
free
free
what
a
glorious
ring
to
the
word
free

twelve
hundred
dollars
with
which
i
purchased
the
freedom
of
myself
and
son
i
consented
to
accept
only
as
a
loan
i
went
to
work
in
earnest
and
in
a
short
time
paid
every
cent
that
was
so
kindly
advanced
by
my
lady
patrons
of
louis
all
this
time
my
husband
was
a
source
of
trouble
to
me
and
a
burden
too
close
occupation
with
my
needle
had
its
effects
upon
my
health
and
feeling
exhausted
with
work
i
determined
to
make
a
change
i
had
a
conversation
with
keckley
informed
him
that
since
he
persisted
in
dissipation
we
must
separate
that
i
was
going
north
and
that
i
should
never
live
with
him
again
at
least
until
i
had
good
evidence
of
his
reform
he
was
rapidly
debasing
himself
and
although
i
was
willing
to
work
for
him
i
was
not
willing
to
share
his
degradation
poor
man
he
had
his
faults
but
over
these
faults
death
has
drawn
a
veil
my
husband
is
now
sleeping
in
his
grave
and
in
the
silent
grave
i
would
bury
all
unpleasant
memories
of
him
i
left
louis
in
the
spring
of
taking
the
cars
direct
for
baltimore
where
i
stopped
six
weeks
attempting
to
realize
a
sum
of
money
by
forming
classes
of
young
colored
women
and
teaching
them
my
system
of
cutting
and
fitting
dresses
the
scheme
was
not
successful
for
after
six
weeks
of
labor
and
vexation
i
left
baltimore
with
scarcely
money
enough
to
pay
my
fare
to
washington
arriving
in
the
capital
i
sought
and
obtained
work
at
two
dollars
and
a
half
per
day
however
as
i
was
notified
that
i
could
only
remain
in
the
city
ten
days
without
obtaining
a
license
to
do
so
such
being
the
law
and
as
i
did
not
know
whom
to
apply
to
for
assistance
i
was
sorely
troubled
i
also
had
to
have
some
one
vouch
to
the
authorities
that
i
was
a
free
woman
my
means
were
too
scanty
and
my
profession
too
precarious
to
warrant
my
purchasing
a
license
in
my
perplexity
i
called
on
a
lady
for
whom
i
was
sewing
miss
ringold
a
member
of
mason
family
from
virginia
i
stated
my
case
and
she
kindly
volunteered
to
render
me
all
the
assistance
in
her
power
she
called
on
mayor
burritt
with
me
and
miss
ringold
succeeded
in
making
an
arrangement
for
me
to
remain
in
washington
without
paying
the
sum
required
for
a
license
moreover
i
was
not
to
be
molested
i
rented
apartments
in
a
good
locality
and
soon
had
a
good
run
of
custom
the
summer
passed
winter
came
and
i
was
still
in
washington
davis
wife
of
senator
jefferson
davis
came
from
the
south
in
november
of
with
her
husband
learning
that
davis
wanted
a
modiste
i
presented
myself
and
was
employed
by
her
on
the
recommendation
of
one
of
my
patrons
and
her
intimate
friend
captain
hetsill
i
went
to
the
house
to
work
but
finding
that
they
were
such
late
risers
and
as
i
had
to
fit
many
dresses
on
davis
i
told
her
that
i
should
prefer
giving
half
the
day
to
her
working
the
other
in
my
own
room
for
some
of
my
other
lady
patrons
consented
to
the
proposition
and
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
come
to
her
own
house
every
day
after
it
was
the
winter
before
the
breaking
out
of
that
fierce
and
bloody
war
between
the
two
sections
of
the
country
and
as
davis
occupied
a
leading
position
his
house
was
the
resort
of
politicians
and
statesmen
from
the
south
almost
every
night
as
i
learned
from
the
servants
and
other
members
of
the
family
secret
meetings
were
held
at
the
house
and
some
of
these
meetings
were
protracted
to
a
very
late
hour
the
prospects
of
war
were
freely
discussed
in
my
presence
by
and
davis
and
their
friends
the
holidays
were
approaching
and
davis
kept
me
busy
in
manufacturing
articles
of
dress
for
herself
and
children
she
desired
to
present
davis
on
christmas
with
a
handsome
the
material
was
purchased
and
for
weeks
the
work
had
been
under
way
christmas
eve
came
and
the
gown
had
been
laid
aside
so
often
that
it
was
still
unfinished
i
saw
that
was
anxious
to
have
it
completed
so
i
volunteered
to
remain
and
work
on
it
wearily
the
hours
dragged
on
but
there
was
no
rest
for
my
busy
fingers
i
persevered
in
my
task
notwithstanding
my
head
was
aching
davis
was
busy
in
the
adjoining
room
arranging
the
christmas
tree
for
the
children
i
looked
at
the
clock
and
the
hands
pointed
to
a
quarter
of
twelve
i
was
arranging
the
cords
on
the
gown
when
the
senator
came
in
he
looked
somewhat
careworn
and
his
step
seemed
to
be
a
little
nervous
he
leaned
against
the
door
and
expressed
his
admiration
of
the
christmas
tree
but
there
was
no
smile
on
his
face
turning
round
he
saw
me
sitting
in
the
adjoining
room
and
quickly
exclaimed
that
you
lizzie
why
are
you
here
so
late
still
at
work
i
hope
that
davis
is
not
too
exacting
no
sir
i
answered
davis
was
very
anxious
to
have
this
gown
finished
and
i
volunteered
to
remain
and
complete
it
well
well
the
case
must
be
urgent
and
he
came
slowly
towards
me
took
the
gown
in
his
hand
and
asked
the
color
of
the
silk
as
he
said
the
was
so
deceptive
to
his
old
eyes
it
is
a
drab
changeable
silk
davis
i
answered
and
might
have
added
that
it
was
rich
and
handsome
but
did
not
well
knowing
that
he
would
make
the
discovery
in
the
morning
he
smiled
curiously
but
turned
and
walked
from
the
room
without
another
question
he
inferred
that
the
gown
was
for
him
that
it
was
to
be
the
christmas
present
from
his
wife
and
he
did
not
wish
to
destroy
the
pleasure
that
she
would
experience
in
believing
that
the
gift
would
prove
a
surprise
in
this
respect
as
in
many
others
he
always
appeared
to
me
as
a
thoughtful
considerate
man
in
the
domestic
circle
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
i
finished
the
gown
little
dreaming
of
the
future
that
was
before
it
it
was
worn
i
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
by
davis
during
the
stormy
years
that
he
was
the
president
of
the
confederate
states
the
holidays
passed
and
before
the
close
of
january
the
war
was
discussed
in
davis
family
as
an
event
certain
to
happen
in
the
future
davis
was
warmly
attached
to
washington
and
i
often
heard
her
say
that
she
disliked
the
idea
of
breaking
up
old
associations
and
going
south
to
suffer
from
trouble
and
deprivation
one
day
while
discussing
the
question
in
my
presence
with
one
of
her
intimate
friends
she
exclaimed
i
would
rather
remain
in
washington
and
be
kicked
about
than
go
south
and
be
mrs
president
her
friend
expressed
surprise
at
the
remark
and
davis
insisted
that
the
opinion
was
an
honest
one
while
dressing
her
one
day
she
said
to
me
lizzie
you
are
so
very
handy
that
i
should
like
to
take
you
south
with
me
when
do
you
go
south
mrs
davis
i
inquired
oh
i
can
not
tell
just
now
but
it
will
be
soon
you
know
there
is
going
to
be
war
lizzie
no
but
i
tell
you
yes
who
will
go
to
war
i
asked
the
north
and
south
was
her
ready
reply
the
southern
people
will
not
submit
to
the
humiliating
demands
of
the
abolition
party
they
will
fight
first
and
which
do
you
think
will
whip
the
south
of
course
the
south
is
impulsive
is
in
earnest
and
the
southern
soldiers
will
fight
to
conquer
the
north
will
yield
when
it
sees
the
south
is
in
earnest
rather
than
engage
in
a
long
and
bloody
war
but
davis
are
you
certain
that
there
will
be
war
certain
i
know
it
you
had
better
go
south
with
me
i
will
take
good
care
of
you
besides
when
the
war
breaks
out
the
colored
people
will
suffer
in
the
north
the
northern
people
will
look
upon
them
as
the
cause
of
the
war
and
i
fear
in
their
exasperation
will
be
inclined
to
treat
you
harshly
then
i
may
come
back
to
washington
in
a
few
months
and
live
in
the
white
house
the
southern
people
talk
of
choosing
davis
for
their
president
in
fact
it
may
be
considered
settled
that
he
will
be
their
president
as
soon
as
we
go
south
and
secede
from
the
other
states
we
will
raise
an
army
and
march
on
washington
and
then
i
shall
live
in
the
white
house
i
was
bewildered
with
what
i
heard
i
had
served
davis
faithfully
and
she
had
learned
to
place
the
greatest
confidence
in
me
at
first
i
was
almost
tempted
to
go
south
with
her
for
her
reasoning
seemed
plausible
at
the
time
the
conversation
was
closed
with
my
promise
to
consider
the
question
i
thought
over
the
question
much
and
the
more
i
thought
the
less
inclined
i
felt
to
accept
the
proposition
so
kindly
made
by
davis
i
knew
the
north
to
be
strong
and
believed
that
the
people
would
fight
for
the
flag
that
they
pretended
to
venerate
so
highly
the
republican
party
had
just
emerged
from
a
heated
campaign
flushed
with
victory
and
i
could
not
think
that
the
hosts
composing
the
party
would
quietly
yield
all
they
had
gained
in
the
presidential
canvass
a
show
of
war
from
the
south
i
felt
would
lead
to
actual
war
in
the
north
and
with
the
two
sections
bitterly
arrayed
against
each
other
i
preferred
to
cast
my
lot
among
the
people
of
the
north
i
parted
with
davis
kindly
half
promising
to
join
her
in
the
south
if
further
deliberation
should
induce
me
to
change
my
views
a
few
weeks
before
she
left
washington
i
made
two
chintz
wrappers
for
her
she
said
that
she
must
give
up
expensive
dressing
for
a
while
and
that
she
with
the
southern
people
now
that
war
was
imminent
must
learn
to
practise
lessons
of
economy
she
left
some
fine
in
my
hands
which
i
finished
and
forwarded
to
her
at
montgomery
alabama
in
the
month
of
june
through
the
assistance
of
emory
one
of
her
oldest
and
best
friends
since
bidding
them
at
washington
early
in
the
year
i
have
never
met
any
of
the
davis
family
years
of
excitement
years
of
bloodshed
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
graves
intervene
between
the
months
i
spent
in
the
family
and
now
the
years
have
brought
many
changes
and
in
view
of
these
terrible
changes
even
i
who
was
once
a
slave
who
have
been
punished
with
the
cruel
lash
who
have
experienced
the
heart
and
soul
tortures
of
a
slave
life
can
say
to
jefferson
davis
peace
you
have
suffered
go
in
peace
in
the
winter
of
i
was
in
chicago
and
one
day
visited
the
great
charity
fair
held
for
the
benefit
of
the
families
of
those
soldiers
who
were
killed
or
wounded
during
the
war
in
one
part
of
the
building
was
a
wax
figure
of
jefferson
davis
wearing
over
his
other
garments
the
dress
in
which
it
was
reported
that
he
was
captured
there
was
always
a
great
crowd
around
this
figure
and
i
was
naturally
attracted
towards
it
i
worked
my
way
to
the
figure
and
in
examining
the
dress
made
the
pleasing
discovery
that
it
was
one
of
the
chintz
wrappers
that
i
had
made
for
davis
a
short
time
before
she
departed
from
washington
for
the
south
when
it
was
announced
that
i
recognized
the
dress
as
one
that
i
had
made
for
the
wife
of
the
late
confederate
president
there
was
great
cheering
and
excitement
and
i
at
once
became
the
object
of
the
deepest
curiosity
great
crowds
followed
me
and
in
order
to
escape
from
the
embarrassing
situation
i
left
the
building
i
believe
it
now
is
pretty
well
established
that
davis
had
on
a
cloak
instead
of
a
dress
as
first
reported
when
he
was
captured
this
does
not
invalidate
any
portion
of
my
story
the
dress
on
the
wax
figure
at
the
fair
in
chicago
unquestionably
was
one
of
the
chintz
wrappers
that
i
made
for
davis
in
january
in
washington
and
i
infer
since
it
was
not
found
on
the
body
of
the
fugitive
president
of
the
south
it
was
taken
from
the
trunks
of
davis
captured
at
the
same
time
be
this
as
it
may
the
coincidence
is
none
the
less
striking
and
curious
chapter
v
my
introduction
to
lincoln
ever
since
arriving
in
washington
i
had
a
great
desire
to
work
for
the
ladies
of
the
white
house
and
to
accomplish
this
end
i
was
ready
to
make
almost
any
sacrifice
consistent
with
propriety
work
came
in
slowly
and
i
was
beginning
to
feel
very
much
embarrassed
for
i
did
not
know
how
i
was
to
meet
the
bills
staring
me
in
the
face
it
is
true
the
bills
were
small
but
then
they
were
formidable
to
me
who
had
little
or
nothing
to
pay
them
with
while
in
this
situation
i
called
at
the
ringolds
where
i
met
captain
lee
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
excitement
as
the
great
event
of
the
season
the
given
in
honor
of
the
prince
of
wales
was
soon
to
come
off
and
she
must
have
a
dress
suitable
for
the
occasion
the
silk
had
been
purchased
but
a
had
not
yet
been
found
miss
ringold
recommended
me
and
i
received
the
order
to
make
the
dress
when
i
called
on
lee
the
next
day
her
husband
was
in
the
room
and
handing
me
a
roll
of
bank
bills
amounting
to
one
hundred
dollars
he
requested
me
to
purchase
the
trimmings
and
to
spare
no
expense
in
making
a
selection
with
the
money
in
my
pocket
i
went
out
in
the
street
entered
the
store
of
harper
mitchell
and
asked
to
look
at
their
laces
harper
waited
on
me
himself
and
was
polite
and
kind
when
i
asked
permission
to
carry
the
laces
to
lee
in
order
to
learn
whether
she
could
approve
my
selection
or
not
he
gave
a
ready
assent
when
i
reminded
him
that
i
was
a
stranger
and
that
the
goods
were
valuable
he
remarked
that
he
was
not
afraid
to
trust
me
that
he
believed
my
face
was
the
index
to
an
honest
heart
it
was
pleasant
to
be
spoken
to
thus
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
kind
words
of
harper
i
often
recall
them
for
they
are
associated
with
the
dawn
of
a
brighter
period
in
my
dark
life
i
purchased
the
trimmings
and
harper
allowed
me
a
commission
of
dollars
on
the
purchase
the
dress
was
done
in
time
and
it
gave
complete
satisfaction
lee
attracted
great
attention
at
the
and
her
elegant
dress
proved
a
good
card
for
me
i
received
numerous
orders
and
was
relieved
from
all
pecuniary
embarrassments
one
of
my
patrons
was
mcclean
a
daughter
of
sumner
one
day
when
i
was
very
busy
mcc
drove
up
to
my
apartments
came
in
where
i
was
engaged
with
my
needle
and
in
her
emphatic
way
said
lizzie
i
am
invited
to
dine
at
willard
on
next
sunday
and
positively
i
have
not
a
dress
fit
to
wear
on
the
occasion
i
have
just
purchased
material
and
you
must
commence
work
on
it
right
away
but
mcclean
i
replied
i
have
more
work
now
promised
than
i
can
do
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
make
a
dress
for
you
to
wear
on
sunday
next
pshaw
nothing
is
impossible
i
must
have
the
dress
made
by
sunday
and
she
spoke
with
some
impatience
i
am
sorry
i
began
but
she
interrupted
me
now
do
say
no
again
i
tell
you
that
you
must
make
the
dress
i
have
often
heard
you
say
that
you
would
like
to
work
for
the
ladies
of
the
white
house
well
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
obtain
you
this
privilege
i
know
lincoln
well
and
you
shall
make
a
dress
for
her
provided
you
finish
mine
in
time
to
wear
at
dinner
on
sunday
the
inducement
was
the
best
that
could
have
been
offered
i
would
undertake
the
dress
if
i
should
have
to
sit
up
all
night
every
night
to
make
my
pledge
good
i
sent
out
and
employed
assistants
and
after
much
worry
and
trouble
the
dress
was
completed
to
the
satisfaction
of
mcclean
it
appears
that
lincoln
had
upset
a
cup
of
coffee
on
the
dress
she
designed
wearing
on
the
evening
of
the
reception
after
the
inauguration
of
abraham
lincoln
as
president
of
the
united
states
which
rendered
it
necessary
that
she
should
have
a
new
one
for
the
occasion
on
asking
mcclean
who
her
was
that
lady
promptly
informed
her
lizzie
keckley
lizzie
keckley
the
name
is
familiar
to
me
she
used
to
work
for
some
of
my
lady
friends
in
louis
and
they
spoke
well
of
her
can
you
recommend
her
to
me
with
confidence
shall
i
send
her
to
you
if
you
please
i
shall
feel
under
many
obligations
for
your
kindness
the
next
sunday
mcclean
sent
me
a
message
to
call
at
her
house
at
four
that
day
as
she
did
not
state
why
i
was
to
call
i
determined
to
wait
till
monday
morning
monday
morning
came
and
nine
found
me
at
mrs
mcc
house
the
streets
of
the
capital
were
thronged
with
people
for
this
was
inauguration
day
a
new
president
a
man
of
the
people
from
the
broad
prairies
of
the
west
was
to
accept
the
solemn
oath
of
office
was
to
assume
the
responsibilities
attached
to
the
high
position
of
chief
magistrate
of
the
united
states
never
was
such
deep
interest
felt
in
the
inauguration
proceedings
as
was
felt
today
for
threats
of
assassination
had
been
made
and
every
breeze
from
the
south
came
heavily
laden
with
the
rumors
of
war
around
hotel
swayed
an
excited
crowd
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
i
worked
my
way
to
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
occupied
by
the
mccleans
mcclean
was
out
but
presently
an
aide
on
general
mcclean
staff
called
and
informed
me
that
i
was
wanted
at
willard
i
crossed
the
street
and
on
entering
the
hotel
was
met
by
mcclean
who
greeted
me
lizzie
why
did
you
not
come
yesterday
as
i
requested
lincoln
wanted
to
see
you
but
i
fear
that
now
you
are
too
late
i
am
sorry
mcclean
you
did
not
say
what
you
wanted
with
me
yesterday
so
i
judged
that
this
morning
would
do
as
well
you
should
have
come
yesterday
she
insisted
go
up
to
room
giving
me
the
number
she
may
find
use
for
you
yet
with
a
nervous
step
i
passed
on
and
knocked
at
lincoln
door
a
cheery
voice
bade
me
come
in
and
a
lady
inclined
to
stoutness
about
forty
years
of
age
stood
before
me
you
are
lizzie
keckley
i
believe
i
bowed
assent
the
that
mcclean
recommended
yes
madam
very
well
i
have
not
time
to
talk
to
you
now
but
would
like
to
have
you
call
at
the
white
house
at
eight
morning
where
i
shall
then
be
i
bowed
myself
out
of
the
room
and
returned
to
my
apartments
the
day
passed
slowly
for
i
could
not
help
but
speculate
in
relation
to
the
appointed
interview
for
the
morrow
my
hope
was
about
to
be
realized
and
i
could
not
rest
tuesday
morning
at
eight
i
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
white
house
for
the
first
time
i
was
shown
into
a
and
informed
that
lincoln
was
at
breakfast
in
the
i
found
no
less
than
three
waiting
for
an
interview
with
the
wife
of
the
new
president
it
seems
that
lincoln
had
told
several
of
her
lady
friends
that
she
had
urgent
need
for
a
and
that
each
of
these
friends
had
sent
her
to
the
white
house
hope
fell
at
once
with
so
many
rivals
for
the
position
sought
after
i
regarded
my
chances
for
success
as
extremely
doubtful
i
was
the
last
one
summoned
to
lincoln
presence
all
the
others
had
a
hearing
and
were
dismissed
i
went
timidly
and
entering
the
room
with
nervous
step
discovered
the
wife
of
the
president
standing
by
a
window
looking
out
and
engaged
in
lively
conversation
with
a
lady
grimsly
as
i
afterwards
learned
came
forward
and
greeted
me
warmly
you
have
come
at
last
keckley
who
have
you
worked
for
in
the
city
among
others
mrs
senator
davis
has
been
one
of
my
best
patrons
was
my
reply
davis
so
you
have
worked
for
her
have
you
of
course
you
gave
satisfaction
so
far
good
can
you
do
my
work
yes
lincoln
will
you
have
much
work
for
me
to
do
that
keckley
will
depend
altogether
upon
your
prices
i
trust
that
your
terms
are
reasonable
i
can
not
afford
to
be
extravagant
we
are
just
from
the
west
and
are
poor
if
you
do
not
charge
too
much
i
shall
be
able
to
give
you
all
my
work
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
any
difficulty
about
charges
lincoln
my
terms
are
reasonable
well
if
you
will
work
cheap
you
shall
have
plenty
to
do
i
afford
to
pay
big
prices
so
i
frankly
tell
you
so
in
the
beginning
the
terms
were
satisfactorily
arranged
and
i
measured
lincoln
took
the
dress
with
me
a
bright
and
returned
the
next
day
to
fit
it
on
her
a
number
of
ladies
were
in
the
room
all
making
preparations
for
the
levee
to
come
off
on
friday
night
these
ladies
i
learned
were
relatives
of
edwards
and
kellogg
her
own
sisters
and
elizabeth
edwards
and
julia
baker
her
nieces
lincoln
this
morning
was
dressed
in
a
cashmere
wrapper
quilted
down
the
front
and
she
wore
a
simple
the
other
ladies
wore
morning
robes
i
was
hard
at
work
on
the
dress
when
i
was
informed
that
the
levee
had
been
postponed
from
friday
night
till
tuesday
night
this
of
course
gave
me
more
time
to
complete
my
task
lincoln
sent
for
me
and
suggested
some
alteration
in
style
which
was
made
she
also
requested
that
i
make
a
waist
of
blue
watered
silk
for
grimsly
as
work
on
the
dress
would
not
require
all
my
time
tuesday
evening
came
and
i
had
taken
the
last
stitches
on
the
dress
i
folded
it
and
carried
it
to
the
white
house
with
the
waist
for
grimsly
when
i
went
i
found
the
ladies
in
a
terrible
state
of
excitement
lincoln
was
protesting
that
she
could
not
go
down
for
the
reason
that
she
had
nothing
to
wear
keckley
you
have
disappointed
me
deceived
me
why
do
you
bring
my
dress
at
this
late
hour
because
i
have
just
finished
it
and
i
thought
i
should
be
in
time
but
you
are
not
in
time
keckley
you
have
bitterly
disappointed
me
i
have
no
time
now
to
dress
and
what
is
more
i
will
not
dress
and
go
i
am
sorry
if
i
have
disappointed
you
lincoln
for
i
intended
to
be
in
time
will
you
let
me
dress
you
i
can
have
you
ready
in
a
few
minutes
no
i
wo
be
dressed
i
will
stay
in
my
room
lincoln
can
go
down
with
the
other
ladies
but
there
is
plenty
of
time
for
you
to
dress
mary
joined
in
grimsly
and
edwards
let
keckley
assist
you
and
she
will
soon
have
you
ready
thus
urged
she
consented
i
dressed
her
hair
and
arranged
the
dress
on
her
it
fitted
nicely
and
she
was
pleased
lincoln
came
in
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
laughed
with
willie
and
little
tad
and
then
commenced
pulling
on
his
gloves
quoting
poetry
all
the
while
you
seem
to
be
in
a
poetical
mood
said
his
wife
yes
mother
these
are
poetical
times
was
his
pleasant
reply
i
declare
you
look
charming
in
that
dress
keckley
has
met
with
great
success
and
then
he
proceeded
to
compliment
the
other
ladies
lincoln
looked
elegant
in
her
she
wore
a
pearl
necklace
pearl
pearl
bracelets
and
red
roses
in
her
hair
baker
was
dressed
in
silk
kellogg
in
a
drab
silk
ashes
of
rose
edwards
in
a
brown
and
black
silk
miss
edwards
in
crimson
and
grimsly
in
blue
watered
silk
just
before
starting
downstairs
lincoln
lace
handkerchief
was
the
object
of
search
it
had
been
displaced
by
tad
who
was
mischievous
and
hard
to
restrain
the
handkerchief
found
all
became
serene
lincoln
took
the
president
arm
and
with
smiling
face
led
the
train
below
i
was
surprised
at
her
grace
and
composure
i
had
heard
so
much
in
current
and
malicious
report
of
her
low
life
of
her
ignorance
and
vulgarity
that
i
expected
to
see
her
embarrassed
on
this
occasion
report
i
soon
saw
was
wrong
no
queen
accustomed
to
the
usages
of
royalty
all
her
life
could
have
comported
herself
with
more
calmness
and
dignity
than
did
the
wife
of
the
president
she
was
confident
and
and
confidence
always
gives
grace
this
levee
was
a
brilliant
one
and
the
only
one
of
the
season
i
became
the
regular
modiste
of
lincoln
i
made
fifteen
or
sixteen
dresses
for
her
during
the
spring
and
early
part
of
the
summer
when
she
left
washington
spending
the
hot
weather
at
saratoga
long
branch
and
other
places
in
the
mean
time
i
was
employed
by
mrs
senator
douglas
one
of
the
loveliest
ladies
that
i
ever
met
secretary
wells
secretary
stanton
and
others
douglas
always
dressed
in
deep
mourning
with
excellent
taste
and
several
of
the
leading
ladies
of
washington
society
were
extremely
jealous
of
her
superior
attractions
chapter
vi
willie
lincoln
lincoln
returned
to
washington
in
november
and
again
duty
called
me
to
the
white
house
the
war
was
now
in
progress
and
every
day
brought
stirring
news
from
the
front
the
front
where
the
gray
opposed
the
blue
where
flashed
the
bright
sabre
in
the
sunshine
where
were
heard
the
angry
notes
of
battle
the
deep
roar
of
cannon
and
the
fearful
rattle
of
musketry
where
new
graves
were
being
made
every
day
where
brother
forgot
a
mother
early
blessing
and
sought
the
lifeblood
of
brother
and
friend
raised
the
deadly
knife
against
friend
oh
the
front
with
its
stirring
oh
the
front
with
its
ghastly
heaps
of
dead
the
life
of
the
nation
was
at
stake
and
when
the
land
was
full
of
sorrow
there
could
not
be
much
gayety
at
the
capital
the
days
passed
quietly
with
me
i
soon
learned
that
some
people
had
an
intense
desire
to
penetrate
the
inner
circle
of
the
white
house
no
president
and
his
family
heretofore
occupying
this
mansion
ever
excited
so
much
curiosity
as
the
present
incumbents
lincoln
had
grown
up
in
the
wilds
of
the
west
and
evil
report
had
said
much
of
him
and
his
wife
the
polite
world
was
shocked
and
the
tendency
to
exaggerate
intensified
curiosity
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
i
was
the
modiste
of
lincoln
parties
crowded
around
and
affected
friendship
for
me
hoping
to
induce
me
to
betray
the
secrets
of
the
domestic
circle
one
day
a
woman
i
will
not
call
her
a
lady
drove
up
to
my
rooms
gave
me
an
order
to
make
a
dress
and
insisted
on
partly
paying
me
in
advance
she
called
on
me
every
day
and
was
exceedingly
kind
when
she
came
to
take
her
dress
away
she
cautiously
remarked
keckley
you
know
mrs
lincoln
yes
you
are
her
modiste
are
you
not
yes
you
know
her
very
well
do
you
not
i
am
with
her
every
day
or
two
do
you
think
you
would
have
some
influence
with
her
i
can
not
say
lincoln
i
presume
would
listen
to
anything
i
should
suggest
but
whether
she
would
be
influenced
by
a
suggestion
of
mine
is
another
question
i
am
sure
that
you
could
influence
her
keckley
now
listen
i
have
a
proposition
to
make
i
have
a
great
desire
to
become
an
inmate
of
the
white
house
i
have
heard
so
much
of
lincoln
goodness
that
i
should
like
to
be
near
him
and
if
i
can
enter
the
white
house
no
other
way
i
am
willing
to
go
as
a
menial
my
dear
keckley
will
you
not
recommend
me
to
lincoln
as
a
friend
of
yours
out
of
employment
and
ask
her
to
take
me
as
a
chambermaid
if
you
will
do
this
you
shall
be
well
rewarded
it
may
be
worth
several
thousand
dollars
to
you
in
time
i
looked
at
the
woman
in
amazement
a
bribe
and
to
betray
the
confidence
of
my
employer
turning
to
her
with
a
glance
of
scorn
i
said
madam
you
are
mistaken
in
regard
to
my
character
sooner
than
betray
the
trust
of
a
friend
i
would
throw
myself
into
the
potomac
river
i
am
not
so
base
as
that
pardon
me
but
there
is
the
door
and
i
trust
that
you
will
never
enter
my
room
again
she
sprang
to
her
feet
in
deep
confusion
and
passed
through
the
door
murmuring
very
well
you
will
live
to
regret
your
action
today
never
never
i
exclaimed
and
closed
the
door
after
her
with
a
bang
i
afterwards
learned
that
this
woman
was
an
actress
and
that
her
object
was
to
enter
the
white
house
as
a
servant
learn
its
secrets
and
then
publish
a
scandal
to
the
world
i
do
not
give
her
name
for
such
publicity
would
wound
the
sensitive
feelings
of
friends
who
would
have
to
share
her
disgrace
without
being
responsible
for
her
faults
i
simply
record
the
incident
to
show
how
i
often
was
approached
by
unprincipled
parties
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
i
indignantly
refused
every
bribe
offered
the
first
public
appearance
of
lincoln
that
winter
was
at
the
reception
on
new
year
day
this
reception
was
shortly
followed
by
a
brilliant
levee
the
day
after
the
levee
i
went
to
the
white
house
and
while
fitting
a
dress
to
lincoln
she
said
lizabeth
she
had
learned
to
drop
the
e
lizabeth
i
have
an
idea
these
are
war
times
and
we
must
be
as
economical
as
possible
you
know
the
president
is
expected
to
give
a
series
of
state
dinners
every
winter
and
these
dinners
are
very
costly
now
i
want
to
avoid
this
expense
and
my
idea
is
that
if
i
give
three
large
receptions
the
state
dinners
can
be
scratched
from
the
programme
what
do
you
think
lizabeth
i
think
that
you
are
right
mrs
lincoln
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
if
i
can
make
lincoln
take
the
same
view
of
the
case
i
shall
not
fail
to
put
the
idea
into
practice
before
i
left
her
room
that
day
lincoln
came
in
she
at
once
stated
the
case
to
him
he
pondered
the
question
a
few
moments
before
answering
mother
i
am
afraid
your
plan
will
not
work
but
it
work
if
you
will
only
determine
that
it
work
it
is
breaking
in
on
the
regular
custom
he
mildly
replied
but
you
forget
father
these
are
war
times
and
old
customs
can
be
done
away
with
for
the
once
the
idea
is
economical
you
must
admit
yes
mother
but
we
must
think
of
something
besides
economy
i
do
think
of
something
else
public
receptions
are
more
democratic
than
stupid
state
dinners
are
more
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
the
institutions
of
our
country
as
you
would
say
if
called
upon
to
make
a
stump
speech
there
are
a
great
many
strangers
in
the
city
foreigners
and
others
whom
we
can
entertain
at
our
receptions
but
whom
we
can
not
invite
to
our
dinners
i
believe
you
are
right
mother
you
argue
the
point
well
i
think
that
we
shall
have
to
decide
on
the
receptions
so
the
day
was
carried
the
question
was
decided
and
arrangements
were
made
for
the
first
reception
it
now
was
january
and
cards
were
issued
for
february
the
children
tad
and
willie
were
constantly
receiving
presents
willie
was
so
delighted
with
a
little
pony
that
he
insisted
on
riding
it
every
day
the
weather
was
changeable
and
exposure
resulted
in
a
severe
cold
which
deepened
into
fever
he
was
very
sick
and
i
was
summoned
to
his
bedside
it
was
sad
to
see
the
poor
boy
suffer
always
of
a
delicate
constitution
he
could
not
resist
the
strong
inroads
of
disease
the
days
dragged
wearily
by
and
he
grew
weaker
and
more
he
was
his
mother
favorite
child
and
she
doted
on
him
it
grieved
her
heart
sorely
to
see
him
suffer
when
able
to
be
about
he
was
almost
constantly
by
her
side
when
i
would
go
in
her
room
almost
always
i
found
willie
there
reading
from
an
open
book
or
curled
up
in
a
chair
with
pencil
and
paper
in
hand
he
had
decidedly
a
literary
taste
and
was
a
studious
boy
a
short
time
before
his
death
he
wrote
this
simple
little
poem
washington
october
dear
sir
i
enclose
you
my
first
attempt
at
poetry
yours
truly
wm
lincoln
the
editor
of
the
national
lines
on
the
death
of
colonel
edward
baker
there
was
no
patriot
like
baker
so
noble
and
so
true
he
fell
as
a
soldier
on
the
field
his
face
to
the
sky
of
blue
his
voice
is
silent
in
the
hall
which
oft
his
presence
graced
no
more
he
hear
the
loud
acclaim
which
rang
from
place
to
place
no
squeamish
notions
filled
his
breast
was
his
theme
surrender
and
no
his
and
night
dream
his
country
has
part
to
pay
those
he
has
left
behind
his
widow
and
his
children
all
she
must
always
keep
in
mind
finding
that
willie
continued
to
grow
worse
lincoln
determined
to
withdraw
her
cards
of
invitation
and
postpone
the
reception
lincoln
thought
that
the
cards
had
better
not
be
withdrawn
at
least
he
advised
that
the
doctor
be
consulted
before
any
steps
were
taken
accordingly
stone
was
called
in
he
pronounced
willie
better
and
said
that
there
was
every
reason
for
an
early
recovery
he
thought
since
the
invitations
had
been
issued
it
would
be
best
to
go
on
with
the
reception
willie
he
insisted
was
in
no
immediate
danger
lincoln
was
guided
by
these
counsels
and
no
postponement
was
announced
on
the
evening
of
the
reception
willie
was
suddenly
taken
worse
his
mother
sat
by
his
bedside
a
long
while
holding
his
feverish
hand
in
her
own
and
watching
his
labored
breathing
the
doctor
claimed
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
i
arranged
lincoln
hair
then
assisted
her
to
dress
her
dress
was
white
satin
trimmed
with
black
lace
the
trail
was
very
long
and
as
she
swept
through
the
room
lincoln
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
his
hands
behind
him
and
his
eyes
on
the
carpet
his
face
wore
a
thoughtful
solemn
look
the
rustling
of
the
satin
dress
attracted
his
attention
he
looked
at
it
a
few
moments
then
in
his
quaint
quiet
way
remarked
whew
our
cat
has
a
long
tail
lincoln
did
not
reply
the
president
added
mother
it
is
my
opinion
if
some
of
that
tail
was
nearer
the
head
it
would
be
in
better
style
and
he
glanced
at
her
bare
arms
and
neck
she
had
a
beautiful
neck
and
arm
and
low
dresses
were
becoming
to
her
she
turned
away
with
a
look
of
offended
dignity
and
presently
took
the
president
arm
and
both
went
to
their
guests
leaving
me
alone
with
the
sick
boy
the
reception
was
a
large
and
brilliant
one
and
the
rich
notes
of
the
marine
band
in
the
apartments
below
came
to
the
in
soft
subdued
murmurs
like
the
wild
faint
sobbing
of
spirits
some
of
the
young
people
had
suggested
dancing
but
lincoln
met
the
suggestion
with
an
emphatic
veto
the
brilliance
of
the
scene
could
not
dispel
the
sadness
that
rested
upon
the
face
of
lincoln
during
the
evening
she
came
upstairs
several
times
and
stood
by
the
bedside
of
the
suffering
boy
she
loved
him
with
a
mother
heart
and
her
anxiety
was
great
the
night
passed
slowly
morning
came
and
willie
was
worse
he
lingered
a
few
days
and
died
god
called
the
beautiful
spirit
home
and
the
house
of
joy
was
turned
into
the
house
of
mourning
i
was
worn
out
with
watching
and
was
not
in
the
room
when
willie
died
but
was
immediately
sent
for
i
assisted
in
washing
him
and
dressing
him
and
then
laid
him
on
the
bed
when
lincoln
came
in
i
never
saw
a
man
so
bowed
down
with
grief
he
came
to
the
bed
lifted
the
cover
from
the
face
of
his
child
gazed
at
it
long
and
earnestly
murmuring
my
poor
boy
he
was
too
good
for
this
earth
god
has
called
him
home
i
know
that
he
is
much
better
off
in
heaven
but
then
we
loved
him
so
it
is
hard
hard
to
have
him
die
great
sobs
choked
his
utterance
he
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
and
his
tall
frame
was
convulsed
with
emotion
i
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
my
eyes
full
of
tears
looking
at
the
man
in
silent
wonder
his
grief
unnerved
him
and
made
him
a
weak
passive
child
i
did
not
dream
that
his
rugged
nature
could
be
so
moved
i
shall
never
forget
those
solemn
moments
genius
and
greatness
weeping
over
idol
lost
there
is
a
grandeur
as
well
as
a
simplicity
about
the
picture
that
will
never
fade
with
me
it
is
immortal
i
really
believe
that
i
shall
carry
it
with
me
across
the
dark
mysterious
river
of
death
lincoln
grief
was
inconsolable
the
pale
face
of
her
dead
boy
threw
her
into
convulsions
around
him
love
tendrils
had
been
twined
and
now
that
he
was
dressed
for
the
tomb
it
was
like
tearing
the
tendrils
out
of
the
heart
by
their
roots
willie
she
often
said
if
spared
by
providence
would
be
the
hope
and
stay
of
her
old
age
but
providence
had
not
spared
him
the
light
faded
from
his
eyes
and
the
had
gathered
on
his
brow
in
one
of
her
paroxysms
of
grief
the
president
kindly
bent
over
his
wife
took
her
by
the
arm
and
gently
led
her
to
the
window
with
a
stately
solemn
gesture
he
pointed
to
the
lunatic
asylum
mother
do
you
see
that
large
white
building
on
the
hill
yonder
try
and
control
your
grief
or
it
will
drive
you
mad
and
we
may
have
to
send
you
there
lincoln
was
so
completely
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
that
she
did
not
attend
the
funeral
willie
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
cemetery
and
the
white
house
was
draped
in
mourning
black
crape
everywhere
met
the
eye
contrasting
strangely
with
the
gay
and
brilliant
colors
of
a
few
days
before
party
dresses
were
laid
aside
and
every
one
who
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
presidential
mansion
spoke
in
subdued
tones
when
they
thought
of
the
sweet
boy
at
rest
under
the
sod
and
the
dew
previous
to
this
i
had
lost
my
son
leaving
wilberforce
he
went
to
the
with
the
three
months
troops
and
was
killed
in
missouri
found
his
grave
on
the
where
the
gallant
general
lyon
fell
it
was
a
sad
blow
to
me
and
the
kind
womanly
letter
that
lincoln
wrote
to
me
when
she
heard
of
my
bereavement
was
full
of
golden
words
of
comfort
nathaniel
parker
willis
the
genial
poet
now
sleeping
in
his
grave
wrote
this
beautiful
sketch
of
willie
lincoln
after
the
sad
death
of
the
boy
this
little
fellow
had
his
acquaintances
among
his
father
friends
and
i
chanced
to
be
one
of
them
he
never
failed
to
seek
me
out
in
the
crowd
shake
hands
and
make
some
pleasant
remark
and
this
in
a
boy
of
ten
years
of
age
was
to
say
the
least
endearing
to
a
stranger
but
he
had
more
than
mere
affectionateness
his
as
the
french
call
it
was
extraordinary
i
was
one
day
passing
the
white
house
when
he
was
outside
with
a
on
the
seward
drove
in
with
prince
napoleon
and
two
of
his
suite
in
the
carriage
and
in
a
way
terms
of
intimacy
evidently
existing
between
the
boy
and
the
secretary
the
official
gentleman
took
off
his
hat
and
the
napoleon
did
the
same
all
making
the
young
prince
president
a
ceremonious
salute
not
a
bit
staggered
with
the
homage
willie
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
took
off
his
little
cap
with
graceful
and
bowed
down
formally
to
the
ground
like
a
little
ambassador
they
drove
past
and
he
went
on
unconcernedly
with
his
play
the
impromptu
readiness
and
good
judgment
being
clearly
a
part
of
his
nature
his
genial
and
open
expression
of
countenance
was
none
the
less
ingenuous
and
fearless
for
a
certain
tincture
of
fun
and
it
was
in
this
mingling
of
qualities
that
he
so
faithfully
resembled
his
father
with
all
the
splendor
that
was
around
this
little
fellow
in
his
new
home
he
was
so
bravely
and
beautifully
and
that
only
a
wild
flower
transplanted
from
the
prairie
to
the
he
retained
his
prairie
habits
unalterably
pure
and
simple
till
he
died
his
leading
trait
seemed
to
be
a
fearless
and
kindly
frankness
willing
that
everything
should
be
as
different
as
it
pleased
but
resting
unmoved
in
his
own
conscious
i
found
i
was
studying
him
irresistibly
as
one
of
the
sweet
problems
of
childhood
that
the
world
is
blessed
with
in
rare
places
and
the
news
of
his
death
i
was
absent
from
washington
on
a
visit
to
my
own
children
at
the
time
came
to
me
like
a
knell
heard
unexpectedly
at
a
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
i
went
before
the
hour
to
take
a
near
farewell
look
at
the
dear
boy
for
they
had
embalmed
him
to
send
home
to
the
west
to
sleep
under
the
sod
of
his
own
valley
and
the
was
to
be
closed
before
the
service
the
family
had
just
taken
their
leave
of
him
and
the
servants
and
nurses
were
seeing
him
for
the
last
time
and
with
tears
and
sobs
wholly
unrestrained
for
he
was
loved
like
an
idol
by
every
one
of
them
he
lay
with
eyes
closed
his
brown
hair
parted
as
we
had
known
it
pale
in
the
slumber
of
death
but
otherwise
unchanged
for
he
was
dressed
as
if
for
the
evening
and
held
in
one
of
his
hands
crossed
upon
his
breast
a
bunch
of
exquisite
flowers
a
message
coming
from
his
mother
while
we
were
looking
upon
him
that
those
flowers
might
be
preserved
for
her
she
was
lying
sick
in
her
bed
worn
out
with
grief
and
the
funeral
was
very
touching
of
the
entertainments
in
the
east
room
the
boy
had
been
for
those
who
now
assembled
more
especially
a
most
variation
with
his
bright
face
and
his
apt
greetings
and
replies
he
was
remembered
in
every
part
of
that
hall
built
only
for
pleasure
of
all
the
crowds
each
night
certainly
the
one
least
likely
to
be
death
first
mark
he
was
his
favorite
they
were
intimates
often
seen
hand
in
hand
and
there
sat
the
man
with
a
burden
on
his
brain
at
which
the
world
marvels
bent
now
with
the
load
at
both
heart
and
brain
staggering
under
a
blow
like
the
taking
from
him
of
his
child
his
men
of
power
sat
around
him
mcclellan
with
a
moist
eye
when
he
bowed
to
the
prayer
as
i
could
see
from
where
i
stood
and
chase
and
seward
with
their
austere
features
at
work
and
senators
and
ambassadors
and
soldiers
all
struggling
with
their
tears
great
hearts
sorrowing
with
the
president
as
a
stricken
man
and
a
brother
that
god
may
give
him
strength
for
all
his
burdens
is
i
am
sure
at
present
the
prayer
of
a
nation
this
sketch
was
very
much
admired

her
own

chapter
vii
washington
in
in
the
summer
of
freedmen
began
to
flock
into
washington
from
maryland
and
virginia
they
came
with
a
great
hope
in
their
hearts
and
with
all
their
worldly
goods
on
their
backs
fresh
from
the
bonds
of
slavery
fresh
from
the
benighted
regions
of
the
plantation
they
came
to
the
capital
looking
for
liberty
and
many
of
them
not
knowing
it
when
they
found
it
many
good
friends
reached
forth
kind
hands
but
the
north
is
not
warm
and
impulsive
for
one
kind
word
spoken
two
harsh
ones
were
uttered
there
was
something
repelling
in
the
atmosphere
and
the
bright
joyous
dreams
of
freedom
to
the
slave
faded
were
sadly
altered
in
the
presence
of
that
stern
practical
mother
reality
instead
of
flowery
paths
days
of
perpetual
sunshine
and
bowers
hanging
with
golden
fruit
the
road
was
rugged
and
full
of
thorns
the
sunshine
was
eclipsed
by
shadows
and
the
mute
appeals
for
help
too
often
were
answered
by
cold
neglect
poor
dusky
children
of
slavery
men
and
women
of
my
own
race
the
transition
from
slavery
to
freedom
was
too
sudden
for
you
the
bright
dreams
were
too
rudely
dispelled
you
were
not
prepared
for
the
new
life
that
opened
before
you
and
the
great
masses
of
the
north
learned
to
look
upon
your
helplessness
with
indifference
learned
to
speak
of
you
as
an
idle
dependent
race
reason
should
have
prompted
kinder
thoughts
charity
is
ever
kind
one
fair
summer
evening
i
was
walking
the
streets
of
washington
accompanied
by
a
friend
when
a
band
of
music
was
heard
in
the
distance
we
wondered
what
it
could
mean
and
curiosity
prompted
us
to
find
out
its
meaning
we
quickened
our
steps
and
discovered
that
it
came
from
the
house
of
farnham
the
yard
was
brilliantly
lighted
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
moving
about
and
the
band
was
playing
some
of
its
sweetest
airs
we
approached
the
sentinel
on
duty
at
the
gate
and
asked
what
was
going
on
he
told
us
that
it
was
a
festival
given
for
the
benefit
of
the
sick
and
wounded
soldiers
in
the
city
this
suggested
an
idea
to
me
if
the
white
people
can
give
festivals
to
raise
funds
for
the
relief
of
suffering
soldiers
why
should
not
the
colored
people
go
to
work
to
do
something
for
the
benefit
of
the
suffering
blacks
i
could
not
rest
the
thought
was
ever
present
with
me
and
the
next
sunday
i
made
a
suggestion
in
the
colored
church
that
a
society
of
colored
people
be
formed
to
labor
for
the
benefit
of
the
unfortunate
freedmen
the
idea
proved
popular
and
in
two
weeks
the
contraband
relief
association
was
organized
with
forty
working
members
in
september
of
lincoln
left
washington
for
new
york
and
requested
me
to
follow
her
in
a
few
days
and
join
her
at
the
metropolitan
hotel
i
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
do
so
for
i
thought
that
in
new
york
i
would
be
able
to
do
something
in
the
interests
of
our
society
armed
with
credentials
i
took
the
train
for
new
york
and
went
to
the
metropolitan
where
lincoln
had
secured
accommodations
for
me
the
next
morning
i
told
lincoln
of
my
project
and
she
immediately
headed
my
list
with
a
subscription
of
i
circulated
among
the
colored
people
and
got
them
thoroughly
interested
in
the
subject
when
i
was
called
to
boston
by
lincoln
who
wished
to
visit
her
son
robert
attending
college
in
that
city
i
met
wendell
phillips
and
other
boston
philanthropists
who
gave
me
all
the
assistance
in
their
power
we
held
a
mass
meeting
at
the
colored
baptist
church
rev
grimes
in
boston
raised
a
sum
of
money
and
organized
there
a
branch
society
the
society
was
organized
by
grimes
wife
of
the
pastor
assisted
by
martin
wife
of
rev
stella
martin
this
branch
of
the
main
society
during
the
war
was
able
to
send
us
over
eighty
large
boxes
of
goods
contributed
exclusively
by
the
colored
people
of
boston
returning
to
new
york
we
held
a
successful
meeting
at
the
shiloh
church
rev
henry
highland
garnet
pastor
the
metropolitan
hotel
at
that
time
as
now
employed
colored
help
i
suggested
the
object
of
my
mission
to
robert
thompson
steward
of
the
hotel
who
immediately
raised
quite
a
sum
of
money
among
the
waiters
frederick
douglass
contributed
besides
lecturing
for
us
other
prominent
colored
men
sent
in
liberal
contributions
from
england
b
a
large
quantity
of
stores
was
received
lincoln
made
frequent
contributions
as
also
did
the
president
in
i
was
president
of
the
association
which
office
i
continue
to
hold
for
two
years
after
willie
death
the
white
house
was
the
scene
of
no
fashionable
display
the
memory
of
the
dead
boy
was
duly
respected
in
some
things
lincoln
was
an
altered
woman
sometimes
when
in
her
room
with
no
one
present
but
myself
the
mere
mention
of
willie
name
would
excite
her
emotion
and
any
trifling
memento
that
recalled
him
would
move
her
to
tears
she
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
his
picture
and
after
his
death
she
never
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
guest
room
in
which
he
died
or
the
green
room
in
which
he
was
embalmed
there
was
something
supernatural
in
her
dread
of
these
things
and
something
that
she
could
not
explain
tad
nature
was
the
opposite
of
willie
and
he
was
always
regarded
as
his
father
favorite
child
his
black
eyes
fairly
sparkled
with
mischief
the
war
progressed
fair
fields
had
been
stained
with
blood
thousands
of
brave
men
had
fallen
and
thousands
of
eyes
were
weeping
for
the
fallen
at
home
there
were
desolate
hearthstones
in
the
south
as
well
as
in
the
north
and
as
the
people
of
my
race
watched
the
sanguinary
struggle
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
of
battle
they
lifted
their
faces
zionward
as
if
they
hoped
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
promised
land
beyond
the
sulphureous
clouds
of
smoke
which
shifted
now
and
then
but
to
reveal
ghastly
rows
of
graves
sometimes
the
very
life
of
the
nation
seemed
to
tremble
with
the
fierce
shock
of
arms
in
the
confederates
were
flushed
with
victory
and
sometimes
it
looked
as
if
the
proud
flag
of
the
union
the
glorious
old
stars
and
stripes
must
yield
half
its
nationality
to
the
flag
that
floated
grandly
over
long
columns
of
gray
these
were
sad
anxious
days
to
lincoln
and
those
who
saw
the
man
in
privacy
only
could
tell
how
much
he
suffered
one
day
he
came
into
the
room
where
i
was
fitting
a
dress
on
lincoln
his
step
was
slow
and
heavy
and
his
face
sad
like
a
tired
child
he
threw
himself
upon
a
sofa
and
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hands
he
was
a
complete
picture
of
dejection
lincoln
observing
his
troubled
look
asked
where
have
you
been
father
to
the
war
department
was
the
brief
almost
sullen
answer
any
news
yes
plenty
of
news
but
no
good
news
it
is
dark
dark
everywhere
he
reached
forth
one
of
his
long
arms
and
took
a
small
bible
from
a
stand
near
the
head
of
the
sofa
opened
the
pages
of
the
holy
book
and
soon
was
absorbed
in
reading
them
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
and
on
glancing
at
the
sofa
the
face
of
the
president
seemed
more
cheerful
the
dejected
look
was
gone
and
the
countenance
was
lighted
up
with
new
resolution
and
hope
the
change
was
so
marked
that
i
could
not
but
wonder
at
it
and
wonder
led
to
the
desire
to
know
what
book
of
the
bible
afforded
so
much
comfort
to
the
reader
making
the
search
for
a
missing
article
an
excuse
i
walked
gently
around
the
sofa
and
looking
into
the
open
book
i
discovered
that
lincoln
was
reading
that
divine
comforter
job
he
read
with
christian
eagerness
and
the
courage
and
hope
that
he
derived
from
the
inspired
pages
made
him
a
new
man
i
almost
imagined
that
i
could
hear
the
lord
speaking
to
him
from
out
the
whirlwind
of
battle
gird
up
thy
loins
now
like
a
man
i
will
demand
of
thee
and
declare
thou
unto
me
what
a
sublime
picture
was
this
a
ruler
of
a
mighty
nation
going
to
the
pages
of
the
bible
with
simple
christian
earnestness
for
comfort
and
courage
and
finding
both
in
the
darkest
hours
of
a
nation
calamity
ponder
it
o
ye
scoffers
at
holy
word
and
then
hang
your
heads
for
very
shame
frequent
letters
were
received
warning
lincoln
of
assassination
but
he
never
gave
a
second
thought
to
the
mysterious
warnings
the
letters
however
sorely
troubled
his
wife
she
seemed
to
read
impending
danger
in
every
rustling
leaf
in
every
whisper
of
the
wind
where
are
you
going
now
father
she
would
say
to
him
as
she
observed
him
putting
on
his
overshoes
and
shawl
i
am
going
over
to
the
war
department
mother
to
try
and
learn
some
news
but
father
you
should
not
go
out
alone
you
know
you
are
surrounded
with
danger
all
imagination
what
does
any
one
want
to
harm
me
for
do
worry
about
me
mother
as
if
i
were
a
little
child
for
no
one
is
going
to
molest
me
and
with
a
confident
unsuspecting
air
he
would
close
the
door
behind
him
descend
the
stairs
and
pass
out
to
his
lonely
walk
for
weeks
when
trouble
was
anticipated
friends
of
the
president
would
sleep
in
the
white
house
to
guard
him
from
danger
robert
would
come
home
every
few
months
bringing
new
joy
to
the
family
circle
he
was
very
anxious
to
quit
school
and
enter
the
army
but
the
move
was
sternly
opposed
by
his
mother
we
have
lost
one
son
and
his
loss
is
as
much
as
i
can
bear
without
being
called
upon
to
make
another
sacrifice
she
would
say
when
the
subject
was
under
discussion
but
many
a
poor
mother
has
given
up
all
her
sons
mildly
suggested
lincoln
and
our
son
is
not
more
dear
to
us
than
the
sons
of
other
people
are
to
their
mothers
that
may
be
but
i
can
not
bear
to
have
robert
exposed
to
danger
his
services
are
not
required
in
the
field
and
the
sacrifice
would
be
a
needless
one
the
services
of
every
man
who
loves
his
country
are
required
in
this
war
you
should
take
a
liberal
instead
of
a
selfish
view
of
the
question
mother
argument
at
last
prevailed
and
permission
was
granted
robert
to
enter
the
army
with
the
rank
of
captain
and
he
went
to
the
field
and
remained
in
the
army
till
the
close
of
the
war
i
well
recollect
a
little
incident
that
gave
me
a
clearer
insight
into
robert
character
he
was
at
home
at
the
time
the
tom
thumb
combination
was
at
washington
the
marriage
of
little
charles
stratton
to
miss
warren
created
no
little
excitement
in
the
world
and
the
people
of
washington
participated
in
the
general
curiosity
some
of
lincoln
friends
made
her
believe
that
it
was
the
duty
of
lincoln
to
show
some
attention
to
the
remarkable
dwarfs
tom
thumb
had
been
caressed
by
royalty
in
the
old
world
and
why
should
not
the
wife
of
the
president
of
his
native
country
smile
upon
him
also
verily
duty
is
one
of
the
greatest
bugbears
in
life
a
hasty
reception
was
arranged
and
cards
of
invitation
issued
i
had
dressed
lincoln
and
she
was
ready
to
go
below
and
receive
her
guests
when
robert
entered
his
mother
room
you
are
at
leisure
this
afternoon
are
you
not
robert
yes
mother
of
course
then
you
will
dress
and
come
no
mother
i
do
not
propose
to
assist
in
entertaining
tom
thumb
my
notions
of
duty
perhaps
are
somewhat
different
from
yours
robert
had
a
lofty
soul
and
he
could
not
stoop
to
all
of
the
follies
and
absurdities
of
the
ephemeral
current
of
fashionable
life
lincoln
love
for
her
husband
sometimes
prompted
her
to
act
very
strangely
she
was
extremely
jealous
of
him
and
if
a
lady
desired
to
court
her
displeasure
she
could
select
no
surer
way
to
do
it
than
to
pay
marked
attention
to
the
president
these
little
jealous
freaks
often
were
a
source
of
perplexity
to
lincoln
if
it
was
a
reception
for
which
they
were
dressing
he
would
come
into
her
room
to
conduct
her
downstairs
and
while
pulling
on
his
gloves
ask
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eyes
well
mother
who
must
i
talk
with
shall
it
be
mrs
that
deceitful
woman
no
you
shall
not
listen
to
her
flattery
well
then
what
do
you
say
to
miss
she
is
too
young
and
handsome
to
practise
deceit
young
and
handsome
you
call
her
you
should
not
judge
beauty
for
me
no
she
is
in
league
with
and
you
shall
not
talk
with
her
well
mother
i
must
talk
with
some
one
is
there
any
one
that
you
do
not
object
to
trying
to
button
his
glove
with
a
mock
expression
of
gravity
i
do
know
as
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
talk
to
anybody
in
particular
you
know
well
enough
lincoln
that
i
do
not
approve
of
your
flirtations
with
silly
women
just
as
if
you
were
a
beardless
boy
fresh
from
school
but
mother
i
insist
that
i
must
talk
with
somebody
i
ca
stand
around
like
a
simpleton
and
say
nothing
if
you
will
not
tell
me
who
i
may
talk
with
please
tell
me
who
i
may
talk
with
there
is
and
miss
in
particular
i
detest
them
both
also
will
come
around
you
but
you
need
not
listen
to
her
flattery
these
are
the
ones
in
particular
very
well
mother
now
that
we
have
settled
the
question
to
your
satisfaction
we
will
go
and
always
with
stately
dignity
he
proffered
his
arm
and
led
the
way

candid
opinions
often
and
lincoln
discussed
the
relations
of
cabinet
officers
and
gentlemen
prominent
in
politics
in
my
presence
i
soon
learned
that
the
wife
of
the
president
had
no
love
for
salmon
chase
at
that
time
secretary
of
the
treasury
she
was
well
versed
in
human
character
was
somewhat
suspicious
of
those
by
whom
she
was
surrounded
and
often
her
judgment
was
correct
her
intuition
about
the
sincerity
of
individuals
was
more
accurate
than
that
of
her
husband
she
looked
beyond
and
read
the
reflection
of
action
in
the
future
her
hostility
to
chase
was
very
bitter
she
claimed
that
he
was
a
selfish
politician
instead
of
a
true
patriot
and
warned
lincoln
not
to
trust
him
too
far
the
daughter
of
the
secretary
was
quite
a
belle
in
washington
and
lincoln
who
was
jealous
of
the
popularity
of
others
had
no
desire
to
build
up
her
social
position
through
political
favor
to
her
father
miss
chase
now
mrs
senator
sprague
was
a
lovely
woman
and
was
worthy
of
all
the
admiration
she
received
lincoln
was
more
confiding
than
his
wife
he
never
suspected
the
fidelity
of
those
who
claimed
to
be
his
friends
honest
to
the
very
core
himself
and
frank
as
a
child
he
never
dreamed
of
questioning
the
sincerity
of
others
father
i
do
wish
that
you
would
inquire
a
little
into
the
motives
of
chase
said
his
wife
one
day
the
president
was
lying
carelessly
upon
a
sofa
holding
a
newspaper
in
his
hands
mother
you
are
too
suspicious
i
give
you
credit
for
sagacity
but
you
are
disposed
to
magnify
trifles
chase
is
a
patriot
and
one
of
my
best
friends
yes
one
of
your
best
friends
because
it
is
his
interest
to
be
so
he
is
anything
for
chase
if
he
thought
he
could
make
anything
by
it
he
would
betray
you
i
fear
that
you
are
prejudiced
against
the
man
mother
i
know
that
you
do
him
injustice
lincoln
you
are
either
blind
or
will
not
see
i
am
not
the
only
one
that
has
warned
you
against
him
true
i
receive
letters
daily
from
all
parts
of
the
country
telling
me
not
to
trust
chase
but
then
these
letters
are
written
by
the
political
enemies
of
the
secretary
and
it
would
be
unjust
and
foolish
to
pay
any
attention
to
them
very
well
you
will
find
out
some
day
if
you
live
long
enough
that
i
have
read
the
man
correctly
i
only
hope
that
your
eyes
may
not
be
opened
to
the
truth
when
it
is
too
late
the
president
as
far
as
i
could
judge
from
his
conversation
with
his
wife
continued
to
confide
in
chase
to
the
time
of
his
tragic
death
lincoln
was
especially
severe
on
wm
seward
secretary
of
state
she
but
rarely
lost
an
opportunity
to
say
an
unkind
word
of
him
one
morning
i
went
to
the
white
house
earlier
than
usual
lincoln
was
sitting
in
a
chair
reading
a
paper
stroking
with
one
hand
the
head
of
little
tad
i
was
basting
a
dress
for
lincoln
a
servant
entered
and
handed
the
president
a
letter
just
brought
by
a
messenger
he
broke
the
seal
and
when
he
had
read
the
contents
his
wife
asked
who
is
the
letter
from
father
seward
i
must
go
over
and
see
him
today
seward
i
wish
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
man
he
can
not
be
trusted
you
say
the
same
of
chase
if
i
listened
to
you
i
should
soon
be
without
a
cabinet
better
be
without
it
than
to
confide
in
some
of
the
men
that
you
do
seward
is
worse
than
chase
he
has
no
principle
mother
you
are
mistaken
your
prejudices
are
so
violent
that
you
do
not
stop
to
reason
seward
is
an
able
man
and
the
country
as
well
as
myself
can
trust
him
father
you
are
too
honest
for
this
world
you
should
have
been
born
a
saint
you
will
generally
find
it
a
safe
rule
to
distrust
a
disappointed
ambitious
politician
it
makes
me
mad
to
see
you
sit
still
and
let
that
hypocrite
seward
twine
you
around
his
finger
as
if
you
were
a
skein
of
thread
it
is
useless
to
argue
the
question
mother
you
can
not
change
my
opinion
lincoln
prided
herself
upon
her
ability
to
read
character
she
was
shrewd
and
and
had
no
patience
with
the
frank
confiding
nature
of
the
president
when
andrew
johnson
was
urged
for
military
governor
of
tennessee
lincoln
bitterly
opposed
the
appointment
he
is
a
demagogue
she
said
almost
fiercely
and
if
you
place
him
in
power
lincoln
mark
my
words
you
will
rue
it
some
day
general
mcclellan
when
made
was
the
idol
of
the
soldiers
and
never
was
a
general
more
universally
popular
he
is
a
humbug
remarked
lincoln
one
day
in
my
presence
what
makes
you
think
so
mother
inquired
the
president
because
he
talks
so
much
and
does
so
little
if
i
had
the
power
i
would
very
soon
take
off
his
head
and
put
some
energetic
man
in
his
place
but
i
regard
mcclellan
as
a
patriot
and
an
able
soldier
he
has
been
much
embarrassed
the
troops
are
raw
and
the
subordinate
officers
inclined
to
be
rebellious
there
are
too
many
politicians
in
the
army
with
mcclellan
is
young
and
popular
and
they
are
jealous
of
him
they
will
kill
him
off
if
they
can
mcclellan
can
make
plenty
of
excuse
for
himself
therefore
he
needs
no
advocate
in
you
if
he
would
only
do
something
and
not
promise
so
much
i
might
learn
to
have
a
little
faith
in
him
i
tell
you
he
is
a
humbug
and
you
will
have
to
find
some
man
to
take
his
place
that
is
if
you
wish
to
conquer
the
south
lincoln
could
not
tolerate
general
grant
he
is
a
butcher
she
would
often
say
and
is
not
fit
to
be
at
the
head
of
an
army
but
he
has
been
very
successful
in
the
field
argued
the
president
yes
he
generally
manages
to
claim
a
victory
but
such
a
victory
he
loses
two
men
to
the
enemy
one
he
has
no
management
no
regard
for
life
if
the
war
should
continue
four
years
longer
and
he
should
remain
in
power
he
would
depopulate
the
north
i
could
fight
an
army
as
well
myself
according
to
his
tactics
there
is
nothing
under
the
heavens
to
do
but
to
march
a
new
line
of
men
up
in
front
of
the
rebel
breastworks
to
be
shot
down
as
fast
as
they
take
their
position
and
keep
marching
until
the
enemy
grows
tired
of
the
slaughter
grant
i
repeat
is
an
obstinate
fool
and
a
butcher
well
mother
supposing
that
we
give
you
command
of
the
army
no
doubt
you
would
do
much
better
than
any
general
that
has
been
tried
there
was
a
twinkle
in
the
eyes
and
a
ring
of
irony
in
the
voice
i
have
often
heard
lincoln
say
that
if
grant
should
ever
be
elected
president
of
the
united
states
she
would
desire
to
leave
the
country
and
remain
absent
during
his
term
of
office
it
was
well
known
that
lincoln
brothers
were
in
the
confederate
army
and
for
this
reason
it
was
often
charged
that
her
sympathies
were
with
the
south
those
who
made
the
hasty
charge
were
never
more
widely
mistaken
one
morning
on
my
way
to
the
white
house
i
heard
that
captain
alexander
todd
one
of
her
brothers
had
been
killed
i
did
not
like
to
inform
lincoln
of
his
death
judging
that
it
would
be
painful
news
to
her
i
had
been
in
her
room
but
a
few
minutes
when
she
said
with
apparent
unconcern
lizzie
i
have
just
heard
that
one
of
my
brothers
has
been
killed
in
the
war
i
also
heard
the
same
lincoln
but
hesitated
to
speak
of
it
for
fear
the
subject
would
be
a
painful
one
to
you
you
need
not
hesitate
of
course
it
is
but
natural
that
i
should
feel
for
one
so
nearly
related
to
me
but
not
to
the
extent
that
you
suppose
he
made
his
choice
long
ago
he
decided
against
my
husband
and
through
him
against
me
he
has
been
fighting
against
us
and
since
he
chose
to
be
our
deadly
enemy
i
see
no
special
reason
why
i
should
bitterly
mourn
his
death
i
felt
relieved
and
in
subsequent
conversations
learned
that
lincoln
had
no
sympathy
for
the
south
why
should
i
sympathize
with
the
rebels
she
would
say
are
they
not
against
me
they
would
hang
my
husband
if
it
was
in
their
power
and
perhaps
gibbet
me
with
him
how
then
can
i
sympathize
with
a
people
at
war
with
me
and
mine
she
always
objected
to
being
thought
southern
in
feeling
lincoln
was
generous
by
nature
and
though
his
whole
heart
was
in
the
war
he
could
not
but
respect
the
valor
of
those
opposed
to
him
his
soul
was
too
great
for
the
narrow
selfish
views
of
partisanship
brave
by
nature
himself
he
honored
bravery
in
others
even
his
foes
time
and
again
i
have
heard
him
speak
in
the
highest
terms
of
the
soldierly
qualities
of
such
brave
confederate
generals
as
lee
stonewall
jackson
and
joseph
johns
t
on
jackson
was
his
ideal
soldier
he
is
a
brave
honest
presbyterian
soldier
were
his
words
what
a
pity
that
we
should
have
to
fight
such
a
gallant
fellow
if
we
only
had
such
a
man
to
lead
the
armies
of
the
north
the
country
would
not
be
appalled
with
so
many
disasters
as
this
is
a
rambling
chapter
i
will
here
record
an
incident
showing
his
feeling
toward
robert
lee
the
very
morning
of
the
day
on
which
he
was
assassinated
his
son
capt
robert
lincoln
came
into
the
room
with
a
portrait
of
general
lee
in
his
hand
the
president
took
the
picture
laid
it
on
a
table
before
him
scanned
the
face
thoughtfully
and
said
it
is
a
good
face
it
is
the
face
of
a
noble
noble
brave
man
i
am
glad
that
the
war
is
over
at
last
looking
up
at
robert
he
continued
well
my
son
you
have
returned
safely
from
the
front
the
war
is
now
closed
and
we
soon
will
live
in
peace
with
the
brave
men
that
have
been
fighting
against
us
i
trust
that
the
era
of
good
feeling
has
returned
with
the
war
and
that
henceforth
we
shall
live
in
peace
now
listen
to
me
robert
you
must
lay
aside
your
uniform
and
return
to
college
i
wish
you
to
read
law
for
three
years
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
hope
that
we
will
be
able
to
tell
whether
you
will
make
a
lawyer
or
not
his
face
was
more
cheerful
than
i
had
seen
it
for
a
long
while
and
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
generous
forgiving
mood
chapter
ix
behind
the
scenes
some
of
the
freedmen
and
freedwomen
had
exaggerated
ideas
of
liberty
to
them
it
was
a
beautiful
vision
a
land
of
sunshine
rest
and
glorious
promise
they
flocked
to
washington
and
since
their
extravagant
hopes
were
not
realized
it
was
but
natural
that
many
of
them
should
bitterly
feel
their
disappointment
the
colored
people
are
wedded
to
associations
and
when
you
destroy
these
you
destroy
half
of
the
happiness
of
their
lives
they
make
a
home
and
are
so
fond
of
it
that
they
prefer
it
squalid
though
it
be
to
the
comparative
ease
and
luxury
of
a
shifting
roaming
life
well
the
emancipated
slaves
in
coming
north
left
old
associations
behind
them
and
the
love
for
the
past
was
so
strong
that
they
could
not
find
much
beauty
in
the
new
life
so
suddenly
opened
to
them
thousands
of
the
disappointed
huddled
together
in
camps
fretted
and
pined
like
children
for
the
good
old
times
in
visiting
them
in
the
interests
of
the
relief
society
of
which
i
was
president
they
would
crowd
around
me
with
pitiful
stories
of
distress
often
i
heard
them
declare
that
they
would
rather
go
back
to
slavery
in
the
south
and
be
with
their
old
masters
than
to
enjoy
the
freedom
of
the
north
i
believe
they
were
sincere
in
these
declarations
because
dependence
had
become
a
part
of
their
second
nature
and
independence
brought
with
it
the
cares
and
vexations
of
poverty
i
was
very
much
amused
one
day
at
the
grave
complaints
of
a
good
old
woman
fresh
from
a
life
of
servitude
she
had
never
ventured
beyond
a
plantation
until
coming
north
the
change
was
too
radical
for
her
and
she
could
not
exactly
understand
it
she
thought
as
many
others
thought
that
and
lincoln
were
the
government
and
that
the
president
and
his
wife
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
supply
the
extravagant
wants
of
every
one
that
applied
to
them
the
wants
of
this
old
woman
however
were
not
very
extravagant
why
missus
keckley
said
she
to
me
one
day
i
is
been
here
eight
months
and
missus
lingom
a
even
give
me
one
shife
bliss
god
childen
if
i
had
ar
know
dat
de
government
and
mister
and
missus
government
was
going
to
do
dat
ar
way
i
neber
would
comed
here
in
god
wurld
my
old
missus
gib
me
two
shifes
eber
year
i
could
not
restrain
a
laugh
at
the
grave
manner
in
which
this
good
old
woman
entered
her
protest
her
idea
of
freedom
was
two
or
more
old
shifts
every
year
northern
readers
may
not
fully
recognize
the
pith
of
the
joke
on
the
southern
plantation
the
mistress
according
to
established
custom
every
year
made
a
present
of
certain
to
her
slaves
which
articles
were
always
anxiously
looked
forward
to
and
thankfully
received
the
old
woman
had
been
in
the
habit
of
receiving
annually
two
shifts
from
her
mistress
and
she
thought
the
wife
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
very
mean
for
overlooking
this
established
custom
of
the
plantation
while
some
of
the
emancipated
blacks
pined
for
the
old
associations
of
slavery
and
refused
to
help
themselves
others
went
to
work
with
commendable
energy
and
planned
with
remarkable
forethought
they
built
themselves
cabins
and
each
family
cultivated
for
itself
a
small
patch
of
ground
the
colored
people
are
fond
of
domestic
life
and
with
them
domestication
means
happy
children
a
fat
pig
a
dozen
or
more
chickens
and
a
garden
whoever
visits
the
freedmen
village
now
in
the
vicinity
of
washington
will
discover
all
of
these
evidences
of
prosperity
and
happiness
the
schools
are
objects
of
much
interest
good
teachers
white
and
colored
are
employed
and
whole
brigades
of
dusky
children
are
there
taught
the
common
branches
of
education
these
children
are
studious
and
the
teachers
inform
me
that
their
advancement
is
rapid
i
number
among
my
personal
friends
twelve
colored
girls
employed
as
teachers
in
the
schools
at
washington
the
colored
mission
sabbath
school
established
through
the
influence
of
brown
at
the
fifteenth
street
presbyterian
church
is
always
an
object
of
great
interest
to
the
residents
of
the
capital
as
well
as
to
the
hundreds
of
strangers
visiting
the
city
in
the
receptions
again
commenced
at
the
white
house
for
the
first
two
years
of
lincoln
administration
the
president
selected
a
lady
to
join
in
the
promenade
with
him
which
left
lincoln
free
to
choose
an
escort
from
among
the
distinguished
gentlemen
that
always
surrounded
her
on
such
occasions
this
custom
at
last
was
discontinued
by
lincoln
lizabeth
i
was
sewing
in
her
room
and
she
was
seated
in
a
comfortable
lizabeth
i
have
been
thinking
over
a
little
matter
as
you
are
well
aware
the
president
at
every
reception
selects
a
lady
to
lead
the
promenade
with
him
now
it
occurs
to
me
that
this
custom
is
an
absurd
one
on
such
occasions
our
guests
recognize
the
position
of
the
president
as
first
of
all
consequently
he
takes
the
lead
in
everything
well
now
if
they
recognize
his
position
they
should
also
recognize
mine
i
am
his
wife
and
should
lead
with
him
and
yet
he
offers
his
arm
to
any
other
lady
in
the
room
making
her
first
with
him
and
placing
me
second
the
custom
is
an
absurd
one
and
i
mean
to
abolish
it
the
dignity
that
i
owe
to
my
position
as
president
demands
that
i
should
not
hesitate
any
longer
to
act
lincoln
kept
her
word
ever
after
this
she
either
led
the
promenade
with
the
president
or
the
president
walked
alone
or
with
a
gentleman
the
change
was
much
remarked
but
the
reason
why
it
was
made
i
believe
was
never
generally
known
in
much
doubt
existed
in
regard
to
the
of
lincoln
and
the
white
house
was
besieged
by
all
grades
of
politicians
lincoln
was
often
blamed
for
having
a
certain
class
of
men
around
her
i
have
an
object
in
view
lizabeth
she
said
to
me
in
reference
to
this
matter
in
a
political
canvass
it
is
policy
to
cultivate
every
element
of
strength
these
men
have
influence
and
we
require
influence
to
lincoln
i
will
be
clever
to
them
until
after
the
election
and
then
if
we
remain
at
the
white
house
i
will
drop
every
one
of
them
and
let
them
know
very
plainly
that
i
only
made
tools
of
them
they
are
an
unprincipled
set
and
i
do
mind
a
little
with
them
does
lincoln
know
what
your
purpose
is
i
asked
god
no
he
would
never
sanction
such
a
proceeding
so
i
keep
him
in
the
dark
and
will
tell
him
of
it
when
all
is
over
he
is
too
honest
to
take
the
proper
care
of
his
own
interests
so
i
feel
it
to
be
my
duty
to
electioneer
for
him
lincoln
as
every
one
knows
was
far
from
handsome
he
was
not
admired
for
his
graceful
figure
and
finely
moulded
face
but
for
the
nobility
of
his
soul
and
the
greatness
of
his
heart
his
wife
was
different
he
was
wholly
unselfish
in
every
respect
and
i
believe
that
he
loved
the
mother
of
his
children
very
tenderly
he
asked
nothing
but
affection
from
her
but
did
not
always
receive
it
when
in
one
of
her
wayward
impulsive
moods
she
was
apt
to
say
and
do
things
that
wounded
him
deeply
if
he
had
not
loved
her
she
would
have
been
powerless
to
cloud
his
thoughtful
face
or
gild
it
with
a
ray
of
sunshine
as
she
pleased
we
are
indifferent
to
those
we
do
not
love
and
certainly
the
president
was
not
indifferent
to
his
wife
she
often
wounded
him
in
unguarded
moments
but
calm
reflection
never
failed
to
bring
regret
lincoln
was
extremely
anxious
that
her
husband
should
be
president
of
the
united
states
in
endeavoring
to
make
a
display
becoming
her
exalted
position
she
had
to
incur
many
expenses
lincoln
salary
was
inadequate
to
meet
them
and
she
was
forced
to
run
in
debt
hoping
that
good
fortune
would
favor
her
and
enable
her
to
extricate
herself
from
an
embarrassing
situation
she
bought
the
most
expensive
goods
on
credit
and
in
the
summer
of
enormous
unpaid
bills
stared
her
in
the
face
what
do
you
think
about
the
election
lizabeth
she
said
to
me
one
morning
i
think
that
lincoln
will
remain
in
the
white
house
four
years
longer
i
replied
looking
up
from
my
work
what
makes
you
think
so
somehow
i
have
learned
to
fear
that
he
will
be
defeated
because
he
has
been
tried
and
has
proved
faithful
to
the
best
interests
of
the
country
the
people
of
the
north
recognize
in
him
an
honest
man
and
they
are
willing
to
confide
in
him
at
least
until
the
war
has
been
brought
to
a
close
the
southern
people
made
his
election
a
pretext
for
rebellion
and
now
to
replace
him
by
some
one
else
after
years
of
sanguinary
war
would
look
too
much
like
a
surrender
of
the
north
so
lincoln
is
certain
to
be
he
represents
a
principle
and
to
maintain
this
principle
the
loyal
people
of
the
loyal
states
will
vote
for
him
even
if
he
had
no
merits
to
commend
him
your
view
is
a
plausible
one
lizabeth
and
your
confidence
gives
me
new
hope
if
he
should
be
defeated
i
do
not
know
what
would
become
of
us
all
to
me
to
him
there
is
more
at
stake
in
this
election
than
he
dreams
of
what
can
you
mean
lincoln
i
do
not
comprehend
simply
this
i
have
contracted
large
debts
of
which
he
knows
nothing
and
which
he
will
be
unable
to
pay
if
he
is
defeated
what
are
your
debts
mrs
lincoln
they
consist
chiefly
of
store
bills
i
owe
altogether
about
thousand
dollars
the
principal
portion
at
stewart
in
new
york
you
understand
lizabeth
that
lincoln
has
but
little
idea
of
the
expense
of
a
woman
wardrobe
he
glances
at
my
rich
dresses
and
is
happy
in
the
belief
that
the
few
hundred
dollars
that
i
obtain
from
him
supply
all
my
wants
i
must
dress
in
costly
materials
the
people
scrutinize
every
article
that
i
wear
with
critical
curiosity
the
very
fact
of
having
grown
up
in
the
west
subjects
me
to
more
searching
observation
to
keep
up
appearances
i
must
have
money
more
than
lincoln
can
spare
for
me
he
is
too
honest
to
make
a
penny
outside
of
his
salary
consequently
i
had
and
still
have
no
alternative
but
to
run
in
debt
and
lincoln
does
not
even
suspect
how
much
you
owe
god
no
this
was
a
favorite
expression
of
hers
and
i
would
not
have
him
suspect
if
he
knew
that
his
wife
was
involved
to
the
extent
that
she
is
the
knowledge
would
drive
him
mad
he
is
so
sincere
and
straightforward
himself
that
he
is
shocked
by
the
duplicity
of
others
he
does
not
know
a
thing
about
any
debts
and
i
value
his
happiness
not
to
speak
of
my
own
too
much
to
allow
him
to
know
anything
this
is
what
troubles
me
so
much
if
he
is
i
can
keep
him
in
ignorance
of
my
affairs
but
if
he
is
defeated
then
the
bills
will
be
sent
in
and
he
will
know
all
and
something
like
a
hysterical
sob
escaped
her
lincoln
sometimes
feared
that
the
politicians
would
get
hold
of
the
particulars
of
her
debts
and
use
them
in
the
presidential
campaign
against
her
husband
and
when
this
thought
occurred
to
her
she
was
almost
crazy
with
anxiety
and
fear
when
in
one
of
these
excited
moods
she
would
fiercely
exclaim
the
republican
politicians
must
pay
my
debts
hundreds
of
them
are
getting
immensely
rich
off
the
patronage
of
my
husband
and
it
is
but
fair
that
they
should
help
me
out
of
my
embarrassment
i
will
make
a
demand
of
them
and
when
i
tell
them
the
facts
they
can
not
refuse
to
advance
whatever
money
i
require
chapter
x
the
second
inauguration
lincoln
came
to
my
apartments
one
day
towards
the
close
of
the
summer
of
to
consult
me
in
relation
to
a
dress
and
here
let
me
remark
i
never
approved
of
ladies
attached
to
the
presidential
household
coming
to
my
rooms
i
always
thought
that
it
would
be
more
consistent
with
their
dignity
to
send
for
me
and
let
me
come
to
them
instead
of
their
coming
to
me
i
may
have
peculiar
notions
about
some
things
and
this
may
be
regarded
as
one
of
them
no
matter
i
have
recorded
my
opinion
i
can
not
forget
the
associations
of
my
early
life
well
lincoln
came
to
my
rooms
and
as
usual
she
had
much
to
say
about
the
presidential
election
after
some
conversation
she
asked
lizzie
where
do
you
think
i
will
be
this
time
next
summer
why
in
the
white
house
of
course
i
can
not
believe
so
i
have
no
hope
of
the
of
lincoln
the
canvass
is
a
heated
one
the
people
begin
to
murmur
at
the
war
and
every
vile
charge
is
brought
against
my
husband
no
matter
i
replied
lincoln
will
be
i
am
so
confident
of
it
that
i
am
tempted
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
a
favor
well
if
we
remain
in
the
white
house
i
shall
be
able
to
do
you
many
favors
what
is
the
special
favor
simply
this
lincoln
i
should
like
for
you
to
make
me
a
present
of
the
glove
that
the
president
wears
at
the
first
public
reception
after
his
second
inaugural
you
shall
have
it
in
welcome
it
will
be
so
filthy
when
he
pulls
it
off
i
shall
be
tempted
to
take
the
tongs
and
put
it
in
the
fire
i
can
not
imagine
lizabeth
what
you
want
with
such
a
glove
i
shall
cherish
it
as
a
precious
memento
of
the
second
inauguration
of
the
man
who
has
done
so
much
for
my
race
he
has
been
a
jehovah
to
my
people
has
lifted
them
out
of
bondage
and
directed
their
footsteps
from
darkness
into
light
i
shall
keep
the
glove
and
hand
it
down
to
posterity
you
have
some
strange
ideas
lizabeth
never
mind
you
shall
have
the
glove
that
is
if
lincoln
continues
president
after
the
of
march
next
i
held
lincoln
to
her
promise
that
glove
is
now
in
my
possession
bearing
the
marks
of
the
thousands
of
hands
that
grasped
the
honest
hand
of
lincoln
on
that
eventful
night
alas
it
has
become
a
prouder
sadder
memento
than
i
ever
dreamed
prior
to
making
the
request
it
would
be
in
due
time
the
election
came
off
and
all
of
my
predictions
were
verified
the
loyal
states
decided
that
lincoln
should
continue
at
the
nation
helm
autumn
faded
winter
dragged
slowly
by
and
still
the
country
resounded
with
the
clash
of
arms
the
south
was
suffering
yet
suffering
was
borne
with
heroic
determination
and
the
army
continued
to
present
a
bold
defiant
front
with
the
first
early
breath
of
spring
thousands
of
people
gathered
in
washington
to
witness
the
second
inauguration
of
abraham
lincoln
as
president
of
the
united
states
it
was
a
stirring
day
in
the
national
capital
and
one
that
will
never
fade
from
the
memory
of
those
who
witnessed
the
imposing
ceremonies
the
morning
was
dark
and
gloomy
clouds
hung
like
a
pall
in
the
sky
as
if
portending
some
great
disaster
but
when
the
president
stepped
forward
to
receive
the
oath
of
office
the
clouds
parted
and
a
ray
of
sunshine
streamed
from
the
heavens
to
fall
upon
and
gild
his
face
it
is
also
said
that
a
brilliant
star
was
seen
at
it
was
the
of
life
with
lincoln
and
the
star
as
viewed
in
the
light
of
subsequent
events
was
emblematic
of
a
summons
from
on
high
this
was
saturday
and
on
monday
evening
i
went
to
the
white
house
to
dress
lincoln
for
the
first
grand
levee
while
arranging
hair
the
president
came
in
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
him
since
the
inauguration
and
i
went
up
to
him
proffering
my
hand
with
words
of
congratulation
he
grasped
my
outstretched
hand
warmly
and
held
it
while
he
spoke
thank
you
well
madam
elizabeth
he
always
called
me
madam
elizabeth
i
do
know
whether
i
should
feel
thankful
or
not
the
position
brings
with
it
many
trials
we
do
not
know
what
we
are
destined
to
pass
through
but
god
will
be
with
us
all
i
put
my
trust
in
god
he
dropped
my
hand
and
with
solemn
face
walked
across
the
room
and
took
his
seat
on
the
sofa
prior
to
this
i
had
congratulated
lincoln
and
she
had
answered
with
a
sigh
thank
you
elizabeth
but
now
that
we
have
won
the
position
i
almost
wish
it
were
otherwise
poor
lincoln
is
looking
so
so
completely
worn
out
i
fear
he
will
not
get
through
the
next
four
years
was
it
a
presentiment
that
made
her
take
a
sad
view
of
the
future
news
from
the
front
was
never
more
cheering
on
every
side
the
confederates
were
losing
ground
and
the
lines
of
blue
were
advancing
in
triumph
as
i
would
look
out
my
window
almost
every
day
i
could
see
the
artillery
going
past
on
its
way
to
the
open
space
of
ground
to
fire
a
salute
in
honor
of
some
new
victory
from
every
point
came
glorious
news
of
the
success
of
the
soldiers
that
fought
for
the
union
and
yet
in
their
private
chamber
away
from
the
curious
eyes
of
the
world
the
president
and
his
wife
wore
sad
anxious
faces
i
finished
dressing
lincoln
and
she
took
the
president
arm
and
went
below
it
was
one
of
the
largest
receptions
ever
held
in
washington
thousands
crowded
the
halls
and
rooms
of
the
white
house
eager
to
shake
lincoln
by
his
hand
and
receive
a
gracious
smile
from
his
wife
the
jam
was
terrible
and
the
enthusiasm
great
the
president
hand
was
well
shaken
and
the
next
day
on
visiting
lincoln
i
received
the
soiled
glove
that
lincoln
had
worn
on
his
right
hand
that
night
many
colored
people
were
in
washington
and
large
numbers
had
desired
to
attend
the
levee
but
orders
were
issued
not
to
admit
them
a
gentleman
a
member
of
congress
on
his
way
to
the
white
house
recognized
frederick
douglass
the
eloquent
colored
orator
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
how
do
you
do
douglass
a
fearful
jam
you
are
going
in
of
course
no
that
is
no
to
your
last
question
not
going
in
to
shake
the
president
by
the
hand
why
pray
the
best
reason
in
the
world
strict
orders
have
been
issued
not
to
admit
people
of
color
it
is
a
shame
douglass
that
you
should
thus
be
placed
under
ban
never
mind
wait
here
and
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
the
gentleman
entered
the
white
house
and
working
his
way
to
the
president
asked
permission
to
introduce
douglass
to
him
certainly
said
lincoln
bring
douglass
in
by
all
means
i
shall
be
glad
to
meet
him
the
gentleman
returned
and
soon
douglass
stood
face
to
face
with
the
president
lincoln
pressed
his
hand
warmly
saying
douglass
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
i
have
long
admired
your
course
and
i
value
your
opinions
highly
douglass
was
very
proud
of
the
manner
in
which
lincoln
received
him
on
leaving
the
white
house
he
came
to
a
friend
house
where
a
reception
was
being
held
and
he
related
the
incident
with
great
pleasure
to
myself
and
others
on
the
monday
following
the
reception
at
the
white
house
everybody
was
busy
preparing
for
the
grand
inaugural
ball
to
come
off
that
night
i
was
in
lincoln
room
the
greater
portion
of
the
day
while
dressing
her
that
night
the
president
came
in
and
i
remarked
to
him
how
much
douglass
had
been
pleased
on
the
night
he
was
presented
to
lincoln
at
once
turned
to
her
husband
with
the
inquiry
father
why
was
not
douglass
introduced
to
me
i
do
not
know
i
thought
he
was
presented
but
he
was
not
it
must
have
been
an
oversight
then
mother
i
am
sorry
you
did
not
meet
him
i
finished
dressing
her
for
the
ball
and
accompanied
her
to
the
door
she
was
dressed
magnificently
and
entered
the
leaning
on
the
arm
of
senator
sumner
a
gentleman
that
she
very
much
admired
lincoln
walked
into
the
accompanied
by
two
gentlemen
this
ball
closed
the
season
it
was
the
last
time
that
the
president
and
his
wife
ever
appeared
in
public
some
days
after
lincoln
with
a
party
of
friends
went
to
city
point
on
a
visit
lincoln
had
returned
to
washington
prior
to
the
of
april
on
monday
april
secretary
harlan
came
into
my
room
with
material
for
a
dress
while
conversing
with
her
i
saw
artillery
pass
the
window
and
as
it
was
on
its
way
to
fire
a
salute
i
inferred
that
good
news
had
been
received
at
the
war
department
my
was
on
one
side
of
the
street
and
my
on
the
other
side
inquiring
the
cause
of
the
demonstration
we
were
told
that
richmond
had
fallen
harlan
took
one
of
my
hands
in
each
of
her
own
and
we
rejoiced
together
i
ran
across
to
my
and
on
entering
it
discovered
that
the
girls
in
my
employ
also
had
heard
the
good
news
they
were
particularly
elated
as
it
was
reported
that
the
rebel
capital
had
surrendered
to
colored
troops
i
had
promised
my
employees
a
holiday
when
richmond
should
fall
and
now
that
richmond
had
fallen
they
reminded
me
of
my
promise
i
recrossed
to
my
and
harlan
told
me
that
the
good
news
was
enough
for
her
she
could
afford
to
wait
for
her
dress
and
to
give
the
girls
a
holiday
and
a
treat
by
all
means
she
returned
to
her
house
and
i
joined
my
girls
in
the
joy
of
the
holiday
we
wandered
about
the
streets
of
the
city
with
happy
faces
and
hearts
overflowing
with
joy
the
clerks
in
the
various
departments
also
enjoyed
a
holiday
and
they
improved
it
by
getting
gloriously
fuddled
towards
evening
i
saw
and
many
other
usually
men
in
the
street
in
a
confused
uncertain
state
of
mind
lincoln
had
invited
me
to
accompany
her
to
city
point
i
went
to
the
white
house
and
told
her
that
if
she
intended
to
return
i
would
regard
it
as
a
privilege
to
go
with
her
as
city
point
was
near
petersburg
my
old
home
said
she
designed
returning
and
would
be
delighted
to
take
me
with
her
so
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
accompany
her
a
few
days
after
we
were
on
board
the
steamer
for
city
point
lincoln
was
joined
by
secretary
harlan
and
daughter
senator
sumner
and
several
other
gentlemen
prior
to
this
lincoln
had
started
for
city
point
and
before
we
reached
our
destination
he
had
visited
richmond
petersburg
and
other
points
we
arrived
on
friday
and
lincoln
was
much
disappointed
when
she
learned
that
the
president
had
visited
the
late
confederate
capital
as
she
had
greatly
desired
to
be
with
him
when
he
entered
the
conquered
stronghold
it
was
immediately
arranged
that
the
entire
party
on
board
the
river
queen
should
visit
richmond
and
other
points
with
the
president
the
next
morning
after
the
arrangement
was
perfected
we
were
steaming
up
james
river
the
river
that
so
long
had
been
impassable
even
to
our
gunboats
the
air
was
balmy
and
the
banks
of
the
river
were
beautiful
and
fragrant
with
the
first
sweet
blossoms
of
spring
for
hours
i
stood
on
deck
breathing
the
pure
air
and
viewing
the
landscape
on
either
side
of
the
majestically
flowing
river
here
stretched
fair
fields
emblematic
of
peace
and
here
deserted
camps
and
frowning
forts
speaking
of
the
stern
vicissitudes
of
war
alas
how
many
changes
had
taken
place
since
my
eye
had
wandered
over
the
classic
fields
of
dear
old
virginia
a
birthplace
is
always
dear
no
matter
under
what
circumstances
you
were
born
since
it
revives
in
memory
the
golden
hours
of
childhood
free
from
philosophy
and
the
warm
kiss
of
a
mother
i
wondered
if
i
should
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
familiar
face
i
wondered
what
had
become
of
those
i
once
knew
had
they
fallen
in
battle
been
scattered
by
the
relentless
tide
of
war
or
were
they
still
living
as
they
lived
when
last
i
saw
them
i
wondered
now
that
richmond
had
fallen
and
virginia
been
restored
to
the
clustering
stars
of
the
union
if
the
people
would
come
together
in
the
bonds
of
peace
and
as
i
gazed
and
wondered
the
river
queen
rapidly
carried
us
to
our
destination
the
presidential
party
were
all
curiosity
on
entering
richmond
they
drove
about
the
streets
of
the
city
and
examined
every
object
of
interest
the
capitol
presented
a
desolate
appearance
desks
broken
and
papers
scattered
promiscuously
in
the
hurried
flight
of
the
confederate
congress
i
picked
up
a
number
of
papers
and
by
curious
coincidence
the
resolution
prohibiting
all
free
colored
people
from
entering
the
state
of
virginia
in
the
senate
chamber
i
sat
in
the
chair
that
jefferson
davis
sometimes
occupied
also
in
the
chair
of
the
alexander
stephens
we
paid
a
visit
to
the
mansion
occupied
by
davis
and
family
during
the
war
and
the
ladies
who
were
in
charge
of
it
scowled
darkly
upon
our
party
as
we
passed
through
and
inspected
the
different
rooms
after
a
delightful
visit
we
returned
to
city
point
that
night
in
the
cabin
of
the
river
queen
smiling
faces
gathered
around
the
one
of
the
guests
was
a
young
officer
attached
to
the
sanitary
commission
he
was
seated
near
lincoln
and
by
way
of
pleasantry
remarked
lincoln
you
should
have
seen
the
president
the
other
day
on
his
triumphal
entry
into
richmond
he
was
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
the
ladies
kissed
their
hands
to
him
and
greeted
him
with
the
waving
of
handkerchiefs
he
is
quite
a
hero
when
surrounded
by
pretty
young
ladies
the
young
officer
suddenly
paused
with
a
look
of
embarrassment
lincoln
turned
to
him
with
flashing
eyes
with
the
remark
that
his
familiarity
was
offensive
to
her
quite
a
scene
followed
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
captain
who
incurred
lincoln
displeasure
will
ever
forget
that
memorable
evening
in
the
cabin
of
the
river
queen
at
city
point
saturday
morning
the
whole
party
decided
to
visit
petersburg
and
i
was
only
too
eager
to
accompany
them
when
we
arrived
at
the
city
numbers
crowded
around
the
train
and
a
little
ragged
negro
boy
ventured
timidly
into
the
car
occupied
by
lincoln
and
immediate
friends
and
in
replying
to
numerous
questions
used
the
word
tote
tote
remarked
lincoln
what
do
you
mean
by
tote
why
massa
to
tote
um
on
your
back
very
definite
my
son
i
presume
when
you
tote
a
thing
you
carry
it
by
the
way
sumner
turning
to
the
senator
what
is
the
origin
of
tote
its
origin
is
said
to
be
african
the
latin
word
from
means
all
an
entire
body
the
whole
but
my
young
friend
here
did
not
mean
an
entire
body
or
anything
of
the
kind
when
he
said
he
would
tote
my
things
for
me
interrupted
the
president
very
true
continued
the
senator
he
used
the
word
tote
in
the
african
sense
to
carry
to
bear
tote
in
this
sense
is
defined
in
our
standard
dictionaries
as
a
colloquial
word
of
the
southern
states
used
especially
by
the
negroes
then
you
regard
the
word
as
a
good
one
not
elegant
certainly
for
myself
i
should
prefer
a
better
word
but
since
it
has
been
established
by
usage
i
can
not
refuse
to
recognize
it
thus
the
conversation
proceeded
in
pleasant
style
getting
out
of
the
car
the
president
and
those
with
him
went
to
visit
the
forts
and
other
scenes
while
i
wandered
off
by
myself
in
search
of
those
whom
i
had
known
in
other
days
war
war
i
soon
discovered
had
brought
many
changes
to
the
city
so
well
known
to
me
in
the
days
of
my
youth
i
found
a
number
of
old
friends
but
the
greater
portion
of
the
population
were
strange
to
me
the
scenes
suggested
painful
memories
and
i
was
not
sorry
to
turn
my
back
again
upon
the
city
a
large
peculiarly
shaped
oak
tree
i
well
remember
attracted
the
particular
attention
of
the
president
it
grew
upon
the
outskirts
of
petersburg
and
as
he
had
discovered
it
on
his
first
visit
a
few
days
previous
to
the
second
he
insisted
that
the
party
should
go
with
him
to
take
a
look
at
the
isolated
and
magnificent
specimen
of
the
stately
grandeur
of
the
forest
every
member
of
the
party
was
only
too
willing
to
accede
to
the
president
request
and
the
visit
to
the
oak
was
made
and
much
enjoyed
on
our
return
to
city
point
from
petersburg
the
train
moved
slowly
and
the
president
observing
a
terrapin
basking
in
the
warm
sunshine
on
the
wayside
had
the
conductor
stop
the
train
and
one
of
the
brakemen
bring
the
terrapin
in
to
him
the
movements
of
the
ungainly
little
animal
seemed
to
delight
him
and
he
amused
himself
with
it
until
we
reached
james
river
where
our
steamer
lay
tad
stood
near
and
joined
in
the
happy
laugh
with
his
father
for
a
week
the
river
queen
remained
in
james
river
anchored
the
greater
portion
of
the
time
at
city
point
and
a
pleasant
and
memorable
week
was
it
to
all
on
board
during
the
whole
of
this
time
a
yacht
lay
in
the
stream
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
and
its
peculiar
movements
attracted
the
attention
of
all
on
board
general
grant
and
grant
were
on
our
steamer
several
times
and
many
distinguished
officers
of
the
army
also
were
entertained
by
the
president
and
his
party
lincoln
when
not
off
on
an
excursion
of
any
kind
lounged
about
the
boat
talking
familiarly
with
every
one
that
approached
him
the
day
before
we
started
on
our
journey
back
to
washington
lincoln
was
engaged
in
reviewing
the
troops
in
camp
he
returned
to
the
boat
in
the
evening
with
a
tired
weary
look
mother
he
said
to
his
wife
i
have
shaken
so
many
hands
that
my
arms
ache
tonight
i
almost
wish
that
i
could
go
to
bed
now
as
the
twilight
shadows
deepened
the
lamps
were
lighted
and
the
boat
was
brilliantly
illuminated
as
it
lay
in
the
river
decked
with
lights
it
looked
like
an
enchanted
floating
palace
a
military
band
was
on
board
and
as
the
hours
lengthened
into
night
it
discoursed
sweet
music
many
officers
came
on
board
to
say
and
the
scene
was
a
brilliant
one
indeed
about
lincoln
was
called
upon
to
make
a
speech
rising
to
his
feet
he
said
you
must
excuse
me
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
too
tired
to
speak
on
next
tuesday
night
i
make
a
speech
in
washington
at
which
time
you
will
learn
all
i
have
to
say
and
now
by
way
of
parting
from
the
brave
soldiers
of
our
gallant
army
i
call
upon
the
band
to
play
dixie
it
has
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
and
since
we
have
captured
it
we
have
a
perfect
right
to
enjoy
it
on
taking
his
seat
the
band
at
once
struck
up
with
dixie
that
sweet
inspiring
air
and
when
the
music
died
away
there
were
clapping
of
hands
and
other
manifestations
of
applause
at
the
last
was
spoken
the
lights
were
taken
down
the
river
queen
rounded
out
into
the
water
and
we
were
on
our
way
back
to
washington
we
arrived
at
the
capital
at
on
sunday
evening
where
the
party
separated
each
going
to
his
and
her
own
home
this
was
one
of
the
most
delightful
trips
of
my
life
and
i
always
revert
to
it
with
feelings
of
genuine
pleasure
chapter
xi
the
assassination
of
president
lincoln
i
had
never
heard
lincoln
make
a
public
speech
and
knowing
the
man
so
well
was
very
anxious
to
hear
him
on
the
morning
of
the
tuesday
after
our
return
from
city
point
lincoln
came
to
my
apartments
and
before
she
drove
away
i
asked
permission
to
come
to
the
white
house
that
night
and
hear
lincoln
speak
certainly
lizabeth
if
you
take
any
interest
in
political
speeches
come
and
listen
in
welcome
thank
you
lincoln
may
i
trespass
further
on
your
kindness
by
asking
permission
to
bring
a
friend
with
me
yes
bring
your
friend
also
by
the
way
come
in
time
to
dress
me
before
the
speaking
commences
i
will
be
in
time
you
may
rely
upon
that
good
morning
i
added
as
she
swept
from
my
room
and
passing
out
into
the
street
entered
her
carriage
and
drove
away
about
that
evening
i
entered
the
white
house
as
i
went
i
glanced
into
lincoln
room
through
the
door
and
seated
by
a
desk
was
the
president
looking
over
his
notes
and
muttering
to
himself
his
face
was
thoughtful
his
manner
abstracted
and
i
knew
as
i
paused
a
moment
to
watch
him
that
he
was
rehearsing
the
part
that
he
was
to
play
in
the
great
drama
soon
to
commence
proceeding
to
lincoln
apartment
i
worked
with
busy
fingers
and
in
a
short
time
her
toilette
was
completed
great
crowds
began
to
gather
in
front
of
the
white
house
and
loud
calls
were
made
for
the
president
the
band
stopped
playing
and
as
he
advanced
to
the
centre
window
over
the
door
to
make
his
address
i
looked
out
and
never
saw
such
a
mass
of
heads
before
it
was
like
a
black
gently
swelling
sea
the
swaying
motion
of
the
crowd
in
the
dim
uncertain
light
was
like
the
rising
and
falling
of
billows
like
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
upon
the
stranded
shore
of
the
ocean
close
to
the
house
the
faces
were
plainly
discernible
but
they
faded
into
mere
ghostly
outlines
on
the
outskirts
of
the
assembly
and
what
added
to
the
weird
spectral
beauty
of
the
scene
was
the
confused
hum
of
voices
that
rose
above
the
sea
of
forms
sounding
like
the
subdued
sullen
roar
of
an
ocean
storm
or
the
wind
soughing
through
the
dark
lonely
forest
it
was
a
grand
and
imposing
scene
and
when
the
president
with
pale
face
and
his
soul
flashing
through
his
eyes
advanced
to
speak
he
looked
more
like
a
demigod
than
a
man
crowned
with
the
fleeting
days
of
mortality
the
moment
the
president
appeared
at
the
window
he
was
greeted
with
a
storm
of
applause
and
voices
the
cry
a
light
a
light
a
lamp
was
brought
and
little
tad
at
once
rushed
to
his
father
side
exclaiming
let
me
hold
the
light
papa
let
me
hold
the
light
lincoln
directed
that
the
wish
of
her
son
be
gratified
and
the
lamp
was
transferred
to
his
hands
the
father
and
son
standing
there
in
the
presence
of
thousands
of
free
citizens
the
one
lost
in
a
chain
of
eloquent
ideas
the
other
looking
up
into
the
speaking
face
with
a
proud
manly
look
formed
a
beautiful
and
striking
tableau
there
were
a
number
of
distinguished
gentlemen
as
well
as
ladies
in
the
room
nearly
all
of
whom
remarked
the
picture
i
stood
a
short
distance
from
lincoln
and
as
the
light
from
the
lamp
fell
full
upon
him
making
him
stand
out
boldly
in
the
darkness
a
sudden
thought
struck
me
and
i
whispered
to
the
friend
at
my
side
what
an
easy
matter
would
it
be
to
kill
the
president
as
he
stands
there
he
could
be
shot
down
from
the
crowd
and
no
one
be
able
to
tell
who
fired
the
shot
i
do
not
know
what
put
such
an
idea
into
my
head
unless
it
was
the
sudden
remembrance
of
the
many
warnings
that
lincoln
had
received
the
next
day
i
made
mention
to
lincoln
of
the
idea
that
had
impressed
me
so
strangely
the
night
before
and
she
replied
with
a
sigh
yes
yes
lincoln
life
is
always
exposed
ah
no
one
knows
what
it
is
to
live
in
constant
dread
of
some
fearful
tragedy
the
president
has
been
warned
so
often
that
i
tremble
for
him
on
every
public
occasion
i
have
a
presentiment
that
he
will
meet
with
a
sudden
and
violent
end
i
pray
god
to
protect
my
beloved
husband
from
the
hands
of
the
assassin
lincoln
was
fond
of
pets
he
had
two
goats
that
knew
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
when
he
called
them
they
would
come
bounding
to
his
side
in
the
warm
bright
days
he
and
tad
would
sometimes
play
in
the
yard
with
these
goats
for
an
hour
at
a
time
one
saturday
afternoon
i
went
to
the
white
house
to
dress
lincoln
i
had
nearly
completed
my
task
when
the
president
came
in
it
was
a
bright
day
and
walking
to
the
window
he
looked
down
into
the
yard
smiled
and
turning
to
me
asked
madam
elizabeth
you
are
fond
of
pets
are
you
not
o
yes
sir
i
answered
well
come
here
and
look
at
my
two
goats
i
believe
they
are
the
kindest
and
best
goats
in
the
world
see
how
they
sniff
the
clear
air
and
skip
and
play
in
the
sunshine
whew
what
a
jump
he
exclaimed
as
one
of
the
goats
made
a
lofty
spring
madam
elizabeth
did
you
ever
before
see
such
an
active
goat
musing
a
moment
he
continued
he
feeds
on
my
bounty
and
jumps
with
joy
do
you
think
we
could
call
him
a
but
i
flatter
the
my
goat
is
far
above
him
i
would
rather
wear
his
horns
and
hairy
coat
through
life
than
demean
myself
to
the
level
of
the
man
who
plunders
the
national
treasury
in
the
name
of
patriotism
the
man
who
enlists
into
the
service
for
a
consideration
and
deserts
the
moment
he
receives
his
money
but
to
repeat
the
play
is
bad
enough
but
the
men
who
manipulate
the
grand
machine
and
who
simply
make
the
their
agent
in
an
outrageous
fraud
are
far
worse
they
are
beneath
the
worms
that
crawl
in
the
dark
hidden
places
of
earth
his
lips
curled
with
haughty
scorn
and
a
cloud
was
gathering
on
his
brow
only
a
moment
the
shadow
rested
on
his
face
just
then
both
goats
looked
up
at
the
window
and
shook
their
heads
as
if
they
would
say
how
d
do
old
friend
see
madam
elizabeth
exclaimed
the
president
in
a
tone
of
enthusiasm
my
pets
recognize
me
how
earnestly
they
look
there
they
go
again
what
jolly
fun
and
he
laughed
outright
as
the
goats
bounded
swiftly
to
the
other
side
of
the
yard
just
then
lincoln
called
out
come
lizabeth
if
i
get
ready
to
go
down
this
evening
i
must
finish
dressing
myself
or
you
must
stop
staring
at
those
silly
goats
lincoln
was
not
fond
of
pets
and
she
could
not
understand
how
lincoln
could
take
so
much
delight
in
his
goats
after
willie
death
she
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
anything
he
loved
not
even
a
flower
costly
bouquets
were
presented
to
her
but
she
turned
from
them
with
a
shudder
and
either
placed
them
in
a
room
where
she
could
not
see
them
or
threw
them
out
of
the
window
she
gave
all
of
toys
everything
connected
with
him
away
as
she
said
she
could
not
look
upon
them
without
thinking
of
her
poor
dead
boy
and
to
think
of
him
in
his
white
shroud
and
cold
grave
was
maddening
i
never
in
my
life
saw
a
more
peculiarly
constituted
woman
search
the
world
over
and
you
will
not
find
her
counterpart
after
lincoln
death
the
goats
that
he
loved
so
well
were
given
away
i
believe
to
lee
miss
blair
one
of
the
few
ladies
with
whom
lincoln
was
on
intimate
terms
in
washington
during
my
residence
in
the
capital
i
made
my
home
with
and
walker
lewis
people
of
my
own
race
and
friends
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
the
days
passed
without
any
incident
of
particular
note
disturbing
the
current
of
life
on
friday
morning
april
alas
what
american
does
not
remember
the
day
i
saw
lincoln
but
for
a
moment
she
told
me
that
she
was
to
attend
the
theatre
that
night
with
the
president
but
i
was
not
summoned
to
assist
her
in
making
her
toilette
sherman
had
swept
from
the
northern
border
of
georgia
through
the
heart
of
the
confederacy
down
to
the
sea
striking
the
to
the
rebellion
grant
had
pursued
general
lee
beyond
richmond
and
the
army
of
virginia
that
had
made
such
stubborn
resistance
was
crumbling
to
pieces
fort
sumter
had
fallen
the
stronghold
first
wrenched
from
the
union
and
which
had
braved
the
fury
of
federal
guns
for
so
many
years
was
restored
to
the
union
the
end
of
the
war
was
near
at
hand
and
the
great
pulse
of
the
loyal
north
thrilled
with
joy
the
dark
was
fading
and
a
angel
seemed
to
hover
in
the
sky
whispering
peace
peace
on
earth
toward
men
sons
brothers
fathers
friends
sweethearts
were
coming
home
soon
the
white
tents
would
be
folded
the
volunteer
army
be
disbanded
and
tranquillity
again
reign
happy
happy
day
happy
at
least
to
those
who
fought
under
the
banner
of
the
union
there
was
great
rejoicing
throughout
the
north
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
flags
were
gayly
thrown
to
the
breeze
and
at
night
every
city
blazed
with
its
tens
of
thousand
lights
but
scarcely
had
the
fireworks
ceased
to
play
and
the
lights
been
taken
down
from
the
windows
when
the
lightning
flashed
the
most
appalling
news
over
the
magnetic
wires
the
president
has
been
murdered
spoke
the
messenger
and
the
loud
huzza
died
upon
the
lips
a
nation
suddenly
paused
in
the
midst
of
festivity
and
stood
paralyzed
with
horror
transfixed
with
awe
oh
memorable
day
oh
memorable
night
never
before
was
joy
so
violently
contrasted
with
sorrow
at
at
night
i
was
awakened
by
an
old
friend
and
neighbor
miss
brown
with
the
startling
intelligence
that
the
entire
cabinet
had
been
assassinated
and
lincoln
shot
but
not
mortally
wounded
when
i
heard
the
words
i
felt
as
if
the
blood
had
been
frozen
in
my
veins
and
that
my
lungs
must
collapse
for
the
want
of
air
lincoln
shot
the
cabinet
assassinated
what
could
it
mean
the
streets
were
alive
with
wondering
people
rumors
flew
thick
and
fast
and
the
wildest
reports
came
with
every
new
arrival
the
words
were
repeated
with
blanched
cheeks
and
quivering
lips
i
waked
and
lewis
and
told
them
that
the
president
was
shot
and
that
i
must
go
to
the
white
house
i
could
not
remain
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
i
felt
that
the
house
would
not
hold
me
they
tried
to
quiet
me
but
gentle
words
could
not
calm
the
wild
tempest
they
quickly
dressed
themselves
and
we
sallied
out
into
the
street
to
drift
with
the
excited
throng
we
walked
rapidly
towards
the
white
house
and
on
our
way
passed
the
residence
of
secretary
seward
which
was
surrounded
by
armed
soldiers
keeping
back
all
intruders
with
the
point
of
the
bayonet
we
hurried
on
and
as
we
approached
the
white
house
saw
that
it
too
was
surrounded
with
soldiers
every
entrance
was
strongly
guarded
and
no
one
was
permitted
to
pass
the
guard
at
the
gate
told
us
that
lincoln
had
not
been
brought
home
but
refused
to
give
any
other
information
more
excited
than
ever
we
wandered
down
the
street
grief
and
anxiety
were
making
me
weak
and
as
we
joined
the
outskirts
of
a
large
crowd
i
began
to
feel
as
meek
and
humble
as
a
penitent
child
a
old
man
was
passing
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
face
and
it
seemed
so
full
of
kindness
and
sorrow
that
i
gently
touched
his
arm
and
imploringly
asked
will
you
please
sir
to
tell
me
whether
lincoln
is
dead
or
not
not
dead
he
replied
but
dying
god
help
us
and
with
a
heavy
step
he
passed
on
not
dead
but
dying
then
indeed
god
help
us
we
learned
that
the
president
was
mortally
wounded
that
he
had
been
shot
down
in
his
box
at
the
theatre
and
that
he
was
not
expected
to
live
till
morning
when
we
returned
home
with
heavy
hearts
i
could
not
sleep
i
wanted
to
go
to
lincoln
as
i
pictured
her
wild
with
grief
but
then
i
did
not
know
where
to
find
her
and
i
must
wait
till
morning
never
did
the
hours
drag
so
slowly
every
moment
seemed
an
age
and
i
could
do
nothing
but
walk
about
and
hold
my
arms
in
mental
agony
morning
came
at
last
and
a
sad
morning
was
it
the
flags
that
floated
so
gayly
yesterday
now
were
draped
in
black
and
hung
in
silent
folds
at
the
president
was
dead
and
a
nation
was
mourning
for
him
every
house
was
draped
in
black
and
every
face
wore
a
solemn
look
people
spoke
in
subdued
tones
and
glided
whisperingly
wonderingly
silently
about
the
streets
about
eleven
on
saturday
morning
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
and
a
messenger
asked
for
elizabeth
keckley
who
wants
her
i
asked
i
come
from
lincoln
if
you
are
keckley
come
with
me
immediately
to
the
white
house
i
hastily
put
on
my
shawl
and
bonnet
and
was
driven
at
a
rapid
rate
to
the
white
house
everything
about
the
building
was
sad
and
solemn
i
was
quickly
shown
to
lincoln
room
and
on
entering
saw
tossing
uneasily
about
upon
a
bed
the
room
was
darkened
and
the
only
person
in
it
besides
the
widow
of
the
president
was
secretary
welles
who
had
spent
the
night
with
her
bowing
to
welles
i
went
to
the
bedside
why
did
you
not
come
to
me
last
night
elizabeth
i
sent
for
you
lincoln
asked
in
a
low
whisper
i
did
try
to
come
to
you
but
i
could
not
find
you
i
answered
as
i
laid
my
hand
upon
her
hot
brow
i
afterwards
learned
that
when
she
had
partially
recovered
from
the
first
shock
of
the
terrible
tragedy
in
the
theatre
welles
asked
is
there
no
one
lincoln
that
you
desire
to
have
with
you
in
this
terrible
affliction
yes
send
for
elizabeth
keckley
i
want
her
just
as
soon
as
she
can
be
brought
here
three
messengers
it
appears
were
successively
despatched
for
me
but
all
of
them
mistook
the
number
and
failed
to
find
me
shortly
after
entering
the
room
on
saturday
morning
welles
excused
herself
as
she
said
she
must
go
to
her
own
family
and
i
was
left
alone
with
lincoln
she
was
nearly
exhausted
with
grief
and
when
she
became
a
little
quiet
i
asked
and
received
permission
to
go
into
the
guests
room
where
the
body
of
the
president
lay
in
state
when
i
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
room
i
could
not
help
recalling
the
day
on
which
i
had
seen
little
willie
lying
in
his
coffin
where
the
body
of
his
father
now
lay
i
remembered
how
the
president
had
wept
over
the
pale
beautiful
face
of
his
gifted
boy
and
now
the
president
himself
was
dead
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
spoke
kindly
to
me
but
alas
the
lips
would
never
move
again
the
light
had
faded
from
his
eyes
and
when
the
light
went
out
the
soul
went
with
it
what
a
noble
soul
was
his
noble
in
all
the
noble
attributes
of
god
never
did
i
enter
the
solemn
chamber
of
death
with
such
palpitating
heart
and
trembling
footsteps
as
i
entered
it
that
day
no
common
mortal
had
died
the
moses
of
my
people
had
fallen
in
the
hour
of
his
triumph
fame
had
woven
her
choicest
chaplet
for
his
brow
though
the
brow
was
cold
and
pale
in
death
the
chaplet
should
not
fade
for
god
had
studded
it
with
the
glory
of
the
eternal
stars
when
i
entered
the
room
the
members
of
the
cabinet
and
many
distinguished
officers
of
the
army
were
grouped
around
the
body
of
their
fallen
chief
they
made
room
for
me
and
approaching
the
body
i
lifted
the
white
cloth
from
the
white
face
of
the
man
that
i
had
worshipped
as
an
idol
looked
upon
as
a
notwithstanding
the
violence
of
the
death
of
the
president
there
was
something
beautiful
as
well
as
grandly
solemn
in
the
expression
of
the
placid
face
there
lurked
the
sweetness
and
gentleness
of
childhood
and
the
stately
grandeur
of
godlike
intellect
i
gazed
long
at
the
face
and
turned
away
with
tears
in
my
eyes
and
a
choking
sensation
in
my
throat
ah
never
was
man
so
widely
mourned
before
the
whole
world
bowed
their
heads
in
grief
when
abraham
lincoln
died
returning
to
lincoln
room
i
found
her
in
a
new
paroxysm
of
grief
robert
was
bending
over
his
mother
with
tender
affection
and
little
tad
was
crouched
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
a
world
of
agony
in
his
young
face
i
shall
never
forget
the
scene
the
wails
of
a
broken
heart
the
unearthly
shrieks
the
terrible
convulsions
the
wild
tempestuous
outbursts
of
grief
from
the
soul
i
bathed
head
with
cold
water
and
soothed
the
terrible
tornado
as
best
i
could
tad
grief
at
his
father
death
was
as
great
as
the
grief
of
his
mother
but
her
terrible
outbursts
awed
the
boy
into
silence
sometimes
he
would
throw
his
arms
around
her
neck
and
exclaim
between
his
broken
sobs
do
cry
so
mamma
do
cry
or
you
will
make
me
cry
too
you
will
break
my
heart
lincoln
could
not
bear
to
hear
tad
cry
and
when
he
would
plead
to
her
not
to
break
his
heart
she
would
calm
herself
with
a
great
effort
and
clasp
her
child
in
her
arms
every
room
in
the
white
house
was
darkened
and
every
one
spoke
in
subdued
tones
and
moved
about
with
muffled
tread
the
very
atmosphere
breathed
of
the
great
sorrow
which
weighed
heavily
upon
each
heart
lincoln
never
left
her
room
and
while
the
body
of
her
husband
was
being
borne
in
solemn
state
from
the
atlantic
to
the
broad
prairies
of
the
west
she
was
weeping
with
her
fatherless
children
in
her
private
chamber
she
denied
admittance
to
almost
every
one
and
i
was
her
only
companion
except
her
children
in
the
days
of
her
great
sorrow
there
were
many
surmises
as
to
who
was
implicated
with
wilkes
booth
in
the
assassination
of
the
president
a
new
messenger
had
accompanied
and
lincoln
to
the
theatre
on
that
terrible
friday
night
it
was
the
duty
of
this
messenger
to
stand
at
the
door
of
the
box
during
the
performance
and
thus
guard
the
inmates
from
all
intrusion
it
appears
that
the
messenger
was
carried
away
by
the
play
and
so
neglected
his
duty
that
booth
gained
easy
admission
to
the
box
lincoln
firmly
believed
that
this
messenger
was
implicated
in
the
assassination
plot
one
night
i
was
lying
on
a
lounge
near
the
bed
occupied
by
lincoln
one
of
the
servants
entering
the
room
asked
who
is
on
watch
the
new
messenger
was
the
reply
what
the
man
who
attended
us
to
the
theatre
on
the
night
my
dear
good
husband
was
murdered
he
i
believe
is
one
of
the
murderers
tell
him
to
come
in
to
me
the
messenger
had
overheard
lincoln
words
through
the
door
and
when
he
came
in
he
was
trembling
violently
she
turned
to
him
fiercely
so
you
are
on
guard
on
guard
in
the
white
house
after
helping
to
murder
the
president
pardon
me
but
i
did
not
help
to
murder
the
president
i
could
never
stoop
to
murder
much
less
to
the
murder
of
so
good
and
great
a
man
as
the
president
but
it
appears
that
you
stoop
to
murder
no
no
do
say
that
he
broke
in
god
knows
that
i
am
innocent
i
do
believe
you
why
were
you
not
at
the
door
to
keep
the
assassin
out
when
he
rushed
into
the
box
i
did
wrong
i
admit
and
i
have
bitterly
repented
it
but
i
did
not
help
to
kill
the
president
i
did
not
believe
that
any
one
would
try
to
kill
so
good
a
man
in
such
a
public
place
and
the
belief
made
me
careless
i
was
attracted
by
the
play
and
did
not
see
the
assassin
enter
the
box
but
you
should
have
seen
him
you
had
no
business
to
be
careless
i
shall
always
believe
that
you
are
guilty
hush
i
sha
hear
another
word
she
exclaimed
as
the
messenger
essayed
to
reply
go
now
and
keep
your
watch
she
added
with
an
imperious
wave
of
her
hand
with
mechanical
step
and
white
face
the
messenger
left
the
room
and
lincoln
fell
back
on
her
pillow
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
commenced
sobbing
robert
was
very
tender
to
his
mother
in
the
days
of
her
sorrow
he
suffered
deeply
as
his
haggard
face
indicated
but
he
was
ever
manly
and
collected
when
in
the
presence
of
his
mother
lincoln
was
extremely
nervous
and
she
refused
to
have
anybody
about
her
but
myself
many
ladies
called
but
she
received
none
of
them
had
she
been
less
secluded
in
her
grief
perhaps
she
would
have
had
many
warmer
friends
than
she
has
but
far
be
it
from
me
to
harshly
judge
the
sorrow
of
any
one
could
the
ladies
who
called
to
condole
with
lincoln
after
the
death
of
her
husband
and
who
were
denied
admittance
to
her
chamber
have
seen
how
completely
prostrated
she
was
with
grief
they
would
have
learned
to
speak
more
kindly
of
her
often
at
night
when
tad
would
hear
her
sobbing
he
would
get
up
and
come
to
her
bed
in
his
white
do
cry
mamma
i
can
not
sleep
if
you
cry
papa
was
good
and
he
has
gone
to
heaven
he
is
happy
there
he
is
with
god
and
brother
willie
do
cry
mamma
or
i
will
cry
too
the
closing
appeal
always
proved
the
most
effectual
as
lincoln
could
not
bear
to
hear
her
child
cry
tad
had
been
petted
by
his
father
but
petting
could
not
spoil
such
a
manly
nature
as
his
he
seemed
to
realize
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
president
to
realize
it
in
its
loftiest
and
noblest
sense
one
morning
while
being
dressed
he
looked
up
at
his
nurse
and
said
pa
is
dead
i
can
hardly
believe
that
i
shall
never
see
him
again
i
must
learn
to
take
care
of
myself
now
he
looked
thoughtful
a
moment
then
added
yes
pa
is
dead
and
i
am
only
tad
lincoln
now
little
tad
like
other
little
boys
i
am
not
a
president
son
now
i
wo
have
many
presents
any
more
well
i
will
try
and
be
a
good
boy
and
will
hope
to
go
some
day
to
pa
and
brother
willie
in
heaven
he
was
a
brave
manly
child
and
knew
that
influence
had
passed
out
of
their
hands
with
the
death
of
his
father
and
that
his
position
in
life
was
altered
he
seemed
to
feel
that
people
petted
him
and
gave
him
presents
because
they
wanted
to
please
the
president
of
the
united
states
from
that
period
forward
he
became
more
independent
and
in
a
short
time
learned
to
dispense
with
the
services
of
a
nurse
while
in
chicago
i
saw
him
get
out
his
clothes
one
sunday
morning
and
dress
himself
and
the
change
was
such
a
great
one
to
me
for
while
in
the
white
house
servants
obeyed
his
every
nod
and
bid
that
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
shedding
tears
had
his
father
lived
i
knew
it
would
have
been
different
with
his
favorite
boy
tad
roomed
with
robert
and
he
always
took
pride
in
pleasing
his
brother
after
the
committee
had
started
west
with
the
body
of
the
president
there
was
quite
a
breeze
of
excitement
for
a
few
days
as
to
where
the
remains
should
be
interred
secretary
stanton
and
others
held
frequent
conferences
with
robert
todd
lincoln
cousin
and
henry
an
old
schoolmate
and
friend
of
lincoln
the
city
authorities
of
springfield
had
purchased
a
beautiful
plat
of
ground
in
a
prosperous
portion
of
the
city
and
work
was
rapidly
progressing
on
the
tomb
when
lincoln
made
strenuous
objection
to
the
location
she
declared
that
she
would
stop
the
body
in
chicago
before
it
should
be
laid
to
rest
in
the
lot
purchased
for
the
purpose
by
the
city
of
springfield
she
gave
as
a
reason
that
it
was
her
desire
to
be
laid
by
the
side
of
her
husband
when
she
died
and
that
such
would
be
out
of
the
question
in
a
public
place
of
the
kind
as
is
well
known
the
difficulty
was
finally
settled
by
placing
the
remains
of
the
president
in
the
family
vault
at
oak
ridge
a
charming
spot
for
the
home
of
the
dead
after
the
president
funeral
lincoln
rallied
and
began
to
make
preparations
to
leave
the
white
house
one
day
she
suddenly
exclaimed
god
elizabeth
what
a
change
did
ever
woman
have
to
suffer
so
much
and
experience
so
great
a
change
i
had
an
ambition
to
be
president
that
ambition
has
been
gratified
and
now
i
must
step
down
from
the
pedestal
my
poor
husband
had
he
never
been
president
he
might
be
living
alas
all
is
over
with
me
folding
her
arms
for
a
few
moments
she
rocked
back
and
forth
then
commenced
again
more
vehemently
than
ever
my
god
elizabeth
i
can
never
go
back
to
springfield
no
never
until
i
go
in
my
shroud
to
be
laid
by
my
dear
husband
side
and
may
heaven
speed
that
day
i
should
like
to
live
for
my
sons
but
life
is
so
full
of
misery
that
i
would
rather
die
and
then
she
would
go
off
into
a
fit
of
hysterics
chapter
xii
lincoln
leaves
the
white
house
for
five
weeks
lincoln
was
confined
to
her
room
packing
afforded
quite
a
relief
as
it
so
closely
occupied
us
that
we
had
not
much
time
for
lamentation
letters
of
condolence
were
received
from
all
parts
of
the
country
and
even
from
foreign
potentates
but
andrew
johnson
the
successor
of
lincoln
never
called
on
the
widow
or
even
so
much
as
wrote
a
line
expressing
sympathy
for
her
grief
and
the
loss
of
her
husband
robert
called
on
him
one
day
to
tell
him
that
his
mother
would
turn
the
white
house
over
to
him
in
a
few
days
and
he
never
even
so
much
as
inquired
after
their
welfare
lincoln
firmly
believes
that
johnson
was
concerned
in
the
assassination
plot
in
packing
lincoln
gave
away
everything
intimately
connected
with
the
president
as
she
said
that
she
could
not
bear
to
be
reminded
of
the
past
the
articles
were
given
to
those
who
were
regarded
as
the
warmest
of
lincoln
admirers
all
of
the
presents
passed
through
my
hands
the
dress
that
lincoln
wore
on
the
night
of
the
assassination
was
given
to
slade
the
wife
of
an
old
and
faithful
messenger
the
cloak
stained
with
the
president
blood
was
given
to
me
as
also
was
the
bonnet
worn
on
the
same
memorable
night
afterwards
i
received
the
comb
and
brush
that
lincoln
used
during
his
residence
at
the
white
house
with
this
same
comb
and
brush
i
had
often
combed
his
head
when
almost
ready
to
go
down
to
a
reception
he
would
turn
to
me
with
a
quizzical
look
well
madam
elizabeth
will
you
brush
my
bristles
down
yes
mr
lincoln
then
he
would
take
his
seat
in
an
and
sit
quietly
while
i
arranged
his
hair
as
may
well
be
imagined
i
was
only
too
glad
to
accept
this
comb
and
brush
from
the
hands
of
lincoln
the
cloak
bonnet
comb
and
brush
the
glove
worn
at
the
first
reception
after
the
second
inaugural
and
lincoln
also
given
to
me
i
have
since
donated
for
the
benefit
of
wilberforce
university
a
colored
college
near
xenia
ohio
destroyed
by
fire
on
the
night
that
the
president
was
murdered
there
was
much
surmise
when
lincoln
left
the
white
house
what
her
fifty
or
sixty
boxes
not
to
count
her
score
of
trunks
could
contain
had
the
government
not
been
so
liberal
in
furnishing
the
boxes
it
is
possible
that
there
would
have
been
less
demand
for
so
much
transportation
the
boxes
were
loosely
packed
and
many
of
them
with
articles
not
worth
carrying
away
lincoln
had
a
passion
for
hoarding
old
things
believing
with
toodles
that
they
were
handy
to
have
about
the
house
the
bonnets
that
she
brought
with
her
from
springfield
in
addition
to
every
one
purchased
during
her
residence
in
washington
were
packed
in
the
boxes
and
transported
to
chicago
she
remarked
that
she
might
find
use
for
the
material
some
day
and
it
was
prudent
to
look
to
the
future
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
lincoln
foresight
in
regard
to
the
future
was
only
confined
to
clothing
as
she
owed
at
the
time
of
the
president
death
different
store
bills
amounting
to
seventy
thousand
dollars
lincoln
knew
nothing
of
these
bills
and
the
only
happy
feature
of
his
assassination
was
that
he
died
in
ignorance
of
them
had
he
known
to
what
extent
his
wife
was
involved
the
fact
would
have
embittered
the
only
pleasant
moments
of
his
life
i
disclose
this
secret
in
regard
to
lincoln
debts
in
order
to
explain
why
she
should
subsequently
have
labored
under
pecuniary
embarrassment
the
children
as
well
as
herself
had
received
a
vast
number
of
presents
during
lincoln
administration
and
these
presents
constituted
a
large
item
in
the
contents
of
the
boxes
the
only
article
of
furniture
so
far
as
i
know
taken
away
from
the
white
house
by
lincoln
was
a
little
used
by
the
president
i
recollect
hearing
him
say
one
day
mother
this
little
stand
is
so
handy
and
suits
me
so
well
that
i
do
not
know
how
i
shall
get
along
without
it
when
we
move
away
from
here
he
was
standing
before
a
mirror
brushing
his
hair
when
he
made
the
remark
well
father
lincoln
replied
if
you
like
the
stand
so
well
we
will
take
it
with
us
when
we
go
away
not
for
the
world
he
exclaimed
but
she
interrupted
him
i
should
like
to
know
what
difference
it
makes
if
we
put
a
better
one
in
its
place
that
alters
the
question
if
you
will
put
a
stand
in
its
place
worth
twice
as
much
as
this
one
and
the
commissioner
consents
then
i
have
no
objection
lincoln
remembered
these
words
and
with
the
consent
of
the
commissioner
took
the
stand
to
chicago
with
her
for
the
benefit
of
little
tad
another
stand
i
must
not
forget
to
add
was
put
in
its
place
it
is
charged
that
a
great
deal
of
furniture
was
lost
from
the
white
house
during
lincoln
occupation
of
it
very
true
and
it
can
be
accounted
for
in
this
way
in
some
respects
to
put
the
case
very
plainly
lincoln
was
penny
wise
and
pound
foolish
when
she
moved
into
the
white
house
she
discharged
the
steward
whose
business
it
was
to
look
after
the
affairs
of
the
household
when
the
steward
was
dismissed
there
was
no
one
to
superintend
affairs
and
the
servants
carried
away
many
pieces
of
furniture
in
this
manner
the
furniture
rapidly
disappeared
robert
was
frequently
in
the
room
where
the
boxes
were
being
packed
and
he
tried
without
avail
to
influence
his
mother
to
set
fire
to
her
vast
stores
of
old
goods
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
old
dress
mother
he
would
ask
never
mind
robert
i
will
find
use
for
it
you
do
not
understand
this
business
and
what
is
more
i
hope
i
never
may
understand
it
i
wish
to
heaven
the
car
would
take
fire
in
which
you
place
these
boxes
for
transportation
to
chicago
and
burn
all
of
your
old
plunder
up
and
then
with
an
impatient
gesture
he
would
turn
on
his
heel
and
leave
the
room
robert
is
so
impetuous
his
mother
would
say
to
me
after
the
closing
of
the
door
he
never
thinks
about
the
future
well
i
hope
that
he
will
get
over
his
boyish
notions
in
time
many
of
the
articles
that
lincoln
took
away
from
the
white
house
were
given
after
her
arrival
in
chicago
for
the
benefit
of
charity
fairs
at
last
everything
was
packed
and
the
day
for
departure
for
the
west
came
i
can
never
forget
that
day
it
was
so
unlike
the
day
when
the
body
of
the
president
was
borne
from
the
hall
in
grand
and
solemn
state
then
thousands
gathered
to
bow
the
head
in
reverence
as
the
plumed
hearse
drove
down
the
line
there
was
all
the
pomp
of
military
display
drooping
flags
battalions
with
reversed
arms
and
bands
playing
airs
now
the
wife
of
the
president
was
leaving
the
white
house
and
there
was
scarcely
a
friend
to
tell
her
she
passed
down
the
public
stairway
entered
her
carriage
and
quietly
drove
to
the
depot
where
we
took
the
cars
the
silence
was
almost
painful
it
had
been
arranged
that
i
should
go
to
chicago
when
lincoln
first
suggested
her
plan
i
strongly
objected
but
i
had
been
with
her
so
long
that
she
had
acquired
great
power
over
me
i
can
not
go
west
with
you
lincoln
i
said
when
the
idea
was
first
advanced
but
you
must
go
to
chicago
with
me
elizabeth
i
can
not
do
without
you
you
forget
my
business
lincoln
i
can
not
leave
it
just
now
i
have
the
spring
trousseau
to
make
for
douglas
and
i
have
promised
to
have
it
done
in
less
than
a
week
never
mind
douglas
can
get
some
one
else
to
make
her
trousseau
you
may
find
it
to
your
interest
to
go
i
am
very
poor
now
but
if
congress
makes
an
appropriation
for
my
benefit
you
shall
be
well
rewarded
it
is
not
the
reward
but
i
commenced
by
way
of
reply
but
she
stopped
me
now
do
say
another
word
about
it
if
you
do
not
wish
to
distress
me
i
have
determined
that
you
shall
go
to
chicago
with
me
and
you
go
when
douglas
learned
that
lincoln
wished
me
to
accompany
her
west
she
sent
me
word
never
mind
me
do
all
you
can
for
lincoln
my
heart
sympathy
is
with
her
finding
that
no
excuse
would
be
accepted
i
made
preparations
to
go
to
chicago
with
the
green
car
had
specially
been
chartered
for
us
and
in
this
we
were
conveyed
to
the
west
henry
accompanied
us
and
he
was
remarkably
attentive
and
kind
the
first
night
out
lincoln
had
a
severe
headache
and
while
i
was
bathing
her
temples
she
said
to
me
lizabeth
you
are
my
best
and
kindest
friend
and
i
love
you
as
my
best
friend
i
wish
it
were
in
my
power
to
make
you
comfortable
for
the
balance
of
your
days
if
congress
provides
for
me
depend
upon
it
i
will
provide
for
you
the
trip
was
devoid
of
interest
we
arrived
in
chicago
without
accident
or
delay
and
apartments
were
secured
for
us
at
the
tremont
house
where
we
remained
one
week
at
the
expiration
of
this
time
lincoln
decided
that
living
at
the
hotel
was
attended
with
too
much
expense
so
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
go
to
the
country
rooms
were
selected
at
hyde
park
a
summer
resort
robert
and
tad
accompanied
their
mother
to
hyde
park
we
arrived
about
in
the
afternoon
of
saturday
the
place
had
just
been
opened
the
summer
before
and
there
was
a
newness
about
everything
the
accommodations
were
not
the
rooms
being
small
and
plainly
furnished
it
was
a
lively
day
for
us
all
robert
occupied
himself
unpacking
his
books
and
arranging
them
on
the
shelves
in
the
corner
of
his
small
but
neat
room
i
assisted
him
he
talking
pleasantly
all
the
while
when
we
were
through
he
folded
his
arms
stood
off
a
little
distance
from
the
mantel
with
an
abstracted
look
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
the
great
change
in
his
fortunes
contrasting
the
present
with
the
past
turning
to
me
he
asked
well
keckley
how
do
you
like
our
new
quarters
this
is
a
delightful
place
and
i
think
you
will
pass
your
time
pleasantly
i
answered
he
looked
at
me
with
a
quizzical
smile
then
remarked
you
call
it
a
delightful
place
well
perhaps
it
is
since
you
do
not
have
to
stay
here
you
can
safely
say
as
much
about
the
charming
situation
as
you
please
i
presume
that
i
must
put
up
with
it
as
mother
pleasure
must
be
consulted
before
my
own
but
candidly
i
would
almost
as
soon
be
dead
as
be
compelled
to
remain
three
months
in
this
dreary
house
he
seemed
to
feel
what
he
said
and
going
to
the
window
he
looked
out
upon
the
view
with
moody
countenance
i
passed
into
lincoln
room
and
found
her
lying
upon
the
bed
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
what
a
dreary
place
lizzie
and
to
think
that
i
should
be
compelled
to
live
here
because
i
have
not
the
means
to
live
elsewhere
ah
what
a
sad
change
has
come
to
us
all
i
had
listened
to
her
sobbing
for
eight
weeks
therefore
i
was
never
surprised
to
find
her
in
tears
tad
was
the
only
cheerful
one
of
the
party
he
was
a
child
of
sunshine
and
nothing
seemed
to
dampen
the
ardor
of
his
spirits
sunday
was
a
very
quiet
day
i
looked
out
of
my
window
in
the
morning
upon
the
beautiful
lake
that
formed
one
of
the
most
delightful
views
from
the
house
the
wind
was
just
strong
enough
to
ripple
the
broad
bosom
of
the
water
and
each
ripple
caught
a
jewel
from
the
sunshine
and
threw
it
sparkling
up
towards
the
sky
here
and
there
a
silently
glided
into
view
or
sank
below
the
faint
blue
line
that
marked
the
horizon
glided
and
melted
away
like
the
spectral
shadows
that
sometimes
haunt
the
white
in
the
cold
tranquil
light
of
a
winter
moon
as
i
stood
by
my
window
that
morning
looking
out
upon
the
lake
my
thoughts
were
etherealized
the
reflected
sunbeams
suggested
visions
of
crowns
studded
with
the
jewels
of
eternal
life
and
i
wondered
how
any
one
could
call
hyde
park
a
dreary
place
i
had
seen
so
much
trouble
in
my
life
that
i
was
willing
to
fold
my
arms
and
sink
into
a
passive
slumber
slumber
anywhere
so
the
great
longing
of
the
soul
was
gratified
rest
robert
spent
the
day
in
his
room
with
his
books
while
i
remained
in
lincoln
room
talking
with
her
contrasting
the
present
with
the
past
and
drawing
plans
for
the
future
she
held
no
communication
by
letter
or
otherwise
with
any
of
her
relatives
or
old
friends
saying
that
she
wished
to
lead
a
secluded
life
for
the
summer
old
faces
she
claimed
would
only
bring
back
memories
of
scenes
that
she
desired
to
forget
and
new
faces
she
felt
assured
could
not
sympathize
with
her
distress
or
add
to
the
comforts
of
her
situation
on
monday
morning
robert
was
getting
ready
to
ride
into
chicago
as
business
called
him
to
the
city
where

generally
called
robert

the
brief
reply

mother
i
think
that
she
will
say

then
lincoln
came
in
and

to
her
with
the
eager
question

badly

to
town

determined
that

i
am
going
to
commence
with
you
i
do
want
to
get

the
impetuous
boy

book

to
town
i
suppose
you
want
to
grow
up
to
be
a
great
dunce
hush
tad
you
shall
not
go
to
town
until
you
have
said
a
lesson
and
the
mother
looked
resolute
may
i
go
after
i
learn
my
book
was
the
next
question
yes
if
robert
will
wait
for
you
oh
bob

wait
wo
you
bob
no
i
can
not
wait
but
the
landlord
is
going
in
this
afternoon
and
you
can
go
with
him
you
must
do
as
mother
tells
you
tad
you
are
getting
to
be
a
big
boy
now
and
must
start
to
school
next
fall
and
you
would
not
like
to
go
to
school
without
knowing
how
to
read
where
my
book
ma
get
my
book
quick
i
will
say
my
lesson
and
he
jumped
about
the
room
boisterously
be
quiet
tad
here
is
your
book
and
we
will
now
begin
the
first
lesson
said
his
mother
as
she
seated
herself
in
an
tad
had
always
been
much
humored
by
his
parents
especially
by
his
father
he
suffered
from
a
slight
impediment
in
his
speech
and
had
never
been
made
to
go
to
school
consequently
his
book
knowledge
was
very
limited
i
knew
that
his
education
had
been
neglected
but
had
no
idea
he
was
so
deficient
as
the
first
lesson
at
hyde
park
proved
him
to
be
drawing
a
low
chair
to
his
mother
side
he
opened
his
book
and
began
to
slowly
spell
the
first
word
well
what
does
spell
monkey
was
the
instant
rejoinder
the
word
was
illustrated
by
a
small
of
an
ape
which
looked
to
tad
eyes
very
much
like
a
monkey
and
his
pronunciation
was
guided
by
the
picture
and
not
by
the
sounds
of
the
different
letters
nonsense
exclaimed
his
mother
does
not
spell
monkey
does
spell
monkey
is
that
a
monkey
and
tad
pointed
triumphantly
to
the
picture
no
it
is
not
a
monkey
not
a
monkey
what
is
it
then
an
ape
an
ape
an
ape
do
i
know
a
monkey
when
i
see
it
no
if
you
say
that
is
a
monkey
i
do
know
a
monkey
i
seen
lots
of
them
in
the
street
with
the
organs
i
know
a
monkey
better
than
you
do
i
always
go
out
into
the
street
to
see
them
when
they
come
by
and
you
do
but
tad
listen
to
me
an
ape
is
a
species
of
the
monkey
it
looks
like
a
monkey
but
it
is
not
a
monkey
it
should
look
like
a
monkey
then
here
yib
he
always
called
me
yib
is
this
a
monkey
and
do
spell
monkey
ma
do
know
anything
about
it
and
he
thrust
his
book
into
my
face
in
an
earnest
excited
manner
i
could
not
longer
restrain
myself
and
burst
out
laughing
tad
looked
very
much
offended
and
i
hastened
to
say
i
beg
your
pardon
master
tad
i
hope
that
you
will
excuse
my
want
of
politeness
he
bowed
his
head
in
a
patronizing
way
and
returned
to
the
original
question
is
this
a
monkey
do
spell
monkey
no
tad
your
mother
is
right
spells
ape
you
do
know
as
much
as
ma
both
of
you
do
know
anything
and
master
tad
eyes
flashed
with
indignation
robert
entered
the
room
and
the
question
was
referred
to
him
after
many
explanations
he
succeeded
in
convincing
tad
that
does
not
spell
monkey
and
the
balance
of
the
lesson
was
got
over
with
less
difficulty
whenever
i
think
of
this
incident
i
am
tempted
to
laugh
and
then
it
occurs
to
me
that
had
tad
been
a
negro
boy
not
the
son
of
a
president
and
so
difficult
to
instruct
he
would
have
been
called
and
would
have
been
held
up
as
an
example
of
the
inferiority
of
race
i
know
many
full
negro
boys
able
to
read
and
write
who
are
not
older
than
tad
lincoln
was
when
he
persisted
that
spelt
monkey
do
not
imagine
that
i
desire
to
reflect
upon
the
intellect
of
little
tad
not
at
all
he
is
a
bright
boy
a
son
that
will
do
honor
to
the
genius
and
greatness
of
his
father
i
only
mean
to
say
that
some
incidents
are
about
as
damaging
to
one
side
of
the
question
as
to
the
other
if
a
colored
boy
appears
dull
so
does
a
white
boy
sometimes
and
if
a
whole
race
is
judged
by
a
single
example
of
apparent
dulness
another
race
should
be
judged
by
a
similar
example
i
returned
to
washington
with
lincoln
best
wishes
for
my
success
in
business
the
journey
was
devoid
of
incident
after
resting
a
few
days
i
called
at
the
white
house
and
transacted
some
business
for
lincoln
i
had
no
desire
to
enter
the
house
for
everything
about
it
bitterly
reminded
me
of
the
past
and
when
i
came
out
of
the
door
i
hoped
that
i
had
crossed
the
threshold
for
the
last
time
i
was
asked
by
some
of
my
friends
if
i
had
sent
my
business
cards
to
family
and
my
answer
was
that
i
had
not
as
i
had
no
desire
to
work
for
the
president
family
johnson
was
no
friend
to
lincoln
and
he
had
failed
to
treat
lincoln
in
the
hour
of
her
greatest
sorrow
with
even
common
courtesy
having
promised
to
make
a
spring
trousseau
for
mrs
senator
douglas
as
soon
as
i
should
return
from
chicago
i
called
on
her
to
meet
the
engagement
she
appeared
pleased
to
see
me
and
in
greeting
me
asked
with
evident
surprise
why
keckley
she
always
called
me
keckley
is
this
you
i
did
not
know
you
were
coming
back
it
was
reported
that
you
designed
remaining
with
lincoln
all
summer
lincoln
would
have
been
glad
to
have
kept
me
with
her
had
she
been
able
able
what
do
you
mean
by
that
simply
this
already
she
is
laboring
under
pecuniary
embarrassment
and
was
only
able
to
pay
my
expenses
and
allow
me
nothing
for
my
time
you
surprise
me
i
thought
she
was
left
in
good
circumstances
so
many
think
it
appears
lincoln
i
assure
you
is
now
practising
the
closest
economy
i
must
do
something
for
myself
douglas
so
i
have
come
back
to
washington
to
open
my
shop
the
next
day
i
collected
my
assistants
and
my
business
went
on
as
usual
orders
came
in
more
rapidly
than
i
could
fill
them
one
day
in
the
middle
of
the
month
of
june
the
girl
who
was
attending
the
door
came
into
the
where
i
was
hard
at
work
keckley
there
is
a
lady
below
who
wants
to
see
you
who
is
she
i
do
know
i
did
not
learn
her
name
is
her
face
familiar
does
she
look
like
a
regular
customer
no
she
is
a
stranger
i
do
think
she
was
ever
here
before
she
came
in
an
open
carriage
with
a
black
woman
for
an
attendant
it
may
be
the
wife
of
one
of
johnson
new
secretaries
do
go
down
keckley
exclaimed
my
in
a
chorus
i
went
below
and
on
entering
the
parlor
a
plainly
dressed
lady
rose
to
her
feet
and
asked
is
this
the
dressmaker
yes
i
am
a
dressmaker
mrs
keckley
yes
lincoln
former
dressmaker
were
you
not
yes
i
worked
for
mrs
lincoln
are
you
very
busy
now
very
indeed
can
you
do
anything
for
me
that
depends
upon
what
is
to
be
done
and
when
it
is
to
be
done
well
say
one
dress
now
and
several
others
a
few
weeks
later
i
can
make
one
dress
for
you
now
but
no
more
i
can
not
finish
the
one
for
you
in
less
than
three
weeks
that
will
answer
i
am
patterson
the
daughter
of
president
johnson
i
expect
my
sister
stover
here
in
three
weeks
and
the
dress
is
for
her
we
are
both
the
same
size
and
you
can
fit
the
dress
to
me
the
terms
were
satisfactorily
arranged
and
after
measuring
patterson
she
bade
me
good
morning
entered
her
carriage
and
drove
away
when
i
went
into
the
the
girls
were
anxious
to
learn
who
my
visitor
was
it
was
patterson
the
daughter
of
president
johnson
i
answered
in
response
to
several
questions
what
the
daughter
of
our
good
moses
are
you
going
to
work
for
her
i
have
taken
her
order
i
fear
that
johnson
will
prove
a
poor
moses
and
i
would
not
work
for
any
of
the
family
remarked
one
of
the
girls
none
of
them
appeared
to
like
lincoln
successor
i
finished
the
dress
for
patterson
and
it
gave
satisfaction
i
afterwards
learned
that
both
patterson
and
stover
were
kindhearted
plain
unassuming
women
making
no
pretensions
to
elegance
one
day
when
i
called
at
the
white
house
in
relation
to
some
work
that
i
was
doing
for
them
i
found
patterson
busily
at
work
with
a
the
sight
was
a
novel
one
to
me
for
the
white
house
for
as
long
as
i
remained
with
lincoln
i
do
not
recollect
ever
having
seen
her
with
a
needle
in
her
hand
the
last
work
done
for
the
johnsons
by
me
were
two
dresses
one
for
each
of
the
sisters
patterson
subsequently
wrote
me
a
note
requesting
me
to
cut
and
fit
a
dress
for
her
to
which
i
replied
that
i
never
cut
and
fitted
work
to
be
made
up
outside
of
my
this
brought
our
business
relations
to
an
abrupt
end
the
months
passed
and
my
business
prospered
i
continually
received
letters
from
lincoln
and
as
the
anniversary
of
her
husband
death
approached
she
wrote
in
a
sadder
strain
before
i
left
chicago
she
had
exacted
the
promise
that
should
congress
make
an
appropriation
for
her
benefit
i
must
join
her
in
the
west
and
go
with
her
to
visit
the
tomb
of
the
president
for
the
first
time
the
appropriation
was
made
one
of
the
conditions
of
my
visit
for
without
relief
from
congress
she
would
be
unable
to
bear
my
expenses
the
appropriation
was
not
made
and
so
i
was
unable
to
join
lincoln
at
the
appointed
time
she
wrote
me
that
her
plan
was
to
leave
chicago
in
the
morning
with
tad
reach
springfield
at
night
stop
at
one
of
the
hotels
drive
out
to
oak
ridge
the
next
day
and
take
the
train
for
chicago
the
same
evening
thus
avoiding
a
meeting
with
any
of
her
old
friends
this
plan
as
she
afterwards
wrote
me
was
carried
out
when
the
second
anniversary
approached
president
johnson
and
party
were
swinging
round
the
circle
and
as
they
were
to
visit
chicago
she
was
especially
anxious
to
be
away
from
the
city
when
they
should
arrive
accordingly
she
hurried
off
to
springfield
and
spent
the
time
in
weeping
over
the
tomb
where
repose
the
hallowed
ashes
of
her
husband
during
all
this
time
i
was
asked
many
questions
about
lincoln
some
prompted
by
friendship
but
a
greater
number
by
curiosity
but
my
brief
answers
i
fear
were
not
always
accepted
as
the
most
satisfactory
chapter
xiii
the
origin
of
the
rivalry
between
douglas
and
lincoln
lincoln
from
her
girlhood
up
had
an
ambition
to
become
the
wife
of
a
president
when
a
little
girl
as
i
was
told
by
one
of
her
sisters
she
was
disposed
to
be
a
little
noisy
at
times
and
was
one
day
she
was
romping
about
the
room
making
more
noise
than
the
nerves
of
her
grandmother
could
stand
the
old
lady
looked
over
her
spectacles
and
said
in
a
commanding
tone
sit
down
mary
do
be
quiet
what
on
earth
do
you
suppose
will
become
of
you
if
you
go
on
this
way
oh
i
will
be
the
wife
of
a
president
some
day
carelessly
answered
the
petted
child
lincoln
as
miss
mary
todd
was
quite
a
belle
in
springfield
illinois
and
from
all
accounts
she
was
fond
of
flirting
she
generally
managed
to
keep
a
gentlemen
biting
at
the
hook
that
she
baited
so
temptingly
for
them
the
world
if
i
mistake
not
are
not
aware
that
the
rivalry
between
lincoln
and
stephen
douglas
commenced
over
the
hand
of
miss
mary
todd
the
young
lady
was
ambitious
and
she
smiled
more
sweetly
upon
douglas
and
lincoln
than
any
of
her
other
admirers
as
they
were
regarded
as
rising
men
she
played
her
part
so
well
that
neither
of
the
rivals
for
a
long
time
could
tell
who
would
win
the
day
douglas
first
proposed
for
her
hand
and
she
discarded
him
the
young
man
urged
his
suit
boldly
mary
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
refusing
you
have
always
had
an
ambition
to
become
the
wife
of
a
president
of
the
united
states
pardon
the
egotism
but
i
fear
that
in
refusing
my
hand
you
have
thrown
away
your
best
chance
to
ever
rule
in
the
white
house
i
do
not
understand
you
mr
douglas
then
i
will
speak
more
plainly
you
know
mary
that
i
am
ambitious
like
yourself
and
something
seems
to
whisper
in
my
ear
will
be
president
some
day
depend
upon
it
i
shall
make
a
stubborn
fight
to
win
the
proud
position
you
have
my
best
wishes
douglas
still
i
can
not
consent
to
be
your
wife
i
shall
become
president
or
i
am
the
victim
of
false
prophets
but
it
will
not
be
as
mrs
douglas
i
have
this
little
chapter
in
a
romantic
history
from
the
lips
of
lincoln
herself
at
one
of
the
receptions
at
the
white
house
shortly
after
the
first
inauguration
lincoln
joined
in
the
promenade
with
senator
douglas
he
was
holding
a
bouquet
that
had
been
presented
to
her
and
as
they
moved
along
he
said
mary
it
reminds
me
of
old
times
to
have
you
lean
upon
my
arm
you
refer
to
the
days
of
our
youth
i
must
do
you
the
credit
douglas
to
say
that
you
were
a
gallant
beau
not
only
a
beau
but
a
lover
do
you
remember
the
night
our
flirtation
was
brought
to
an
end
distinctly
you
now
see
that
i
was
right
i
am
president
but
not
mrs
douglas
true
you
have
reached
the
goal
before
me
but
i
do
not
despair
douglas
a
nobler
woman
does
not
live
if
i
am
spared
may
possibly
succeed
you
as
mrs
president
a
few
evenings
after
douglas
had
been
discarded
lincoln
made
a
formal
proposal
for
the
hand
of
miss
todd
but
it
appears
that
the
young
lady
was
not
willing
to
capitulate
at
once
she
believed
that
she
could
send
her
lover
adrift
and
win
him
back
you
are
bold
mr
lincoln
love
makes
me
bold
you
honor
me
pardon
me
but
i
can
not
consent
to
be
your
wife
is
this
your
final
answer
miss
todd
and
the
suitor
rose
nervously
to
his
feet
i
do
not
often
jest
lincoln
why
should
i
reconsider
my
decision
of
excuse
me
your
answer
is
sufficient
i
was
led
to
hope
that
i
might
become
dearer
to
you
than
a
friend
but
the
hope
it
seems
has
proved
an
idle
one
i
have
the
honor
to
say
good
night
miss
todd
and
pale
yet
calm
lincoln
bowed
himself
out
of
the
room
he
rushed
to
his
office
in
a
frantic
state
of
mind
henry
his
most
intimate
friend
happened
to
come
in
and
was
surprised
to
see
the
young
lawyer
walking
the
floor
in
an
agitated
manner
what
is
the
matter
lincoln
you
look
desperate
matter
i
am
sick
of
the
world
it
is
a
heartless
deceitful
world
and
i
care
not
how
soon
i
am
out
of
it
you
rave
what
has
happened
have
you
been
quarrelling
with
your
sweetheart
quarrel
i
wish
to
god
it
was
a
quarrel
for
then
i
could
look
forward
to
reconciliation
the
girl
has
refused
to
become
my
wife
after
leading
me
to
believe
that
she
loved
me
she
is
a
heartless
coquette
do
give
up
the
conquest
so
easily
cheer
up
man
you
may
succeed
yet
perhaps
she
is
only
testing
your
love
no
i
believe
that
she
is
going
to
marry
douglas
if
she
does
i
will
blow
my
brains
out
nonsense
that
would
not
mend
matters
your
brains
were
given
to
you
for
different
use
come
we
will
go
to
your
room
now
go
to
bed
and
sleep
on
the
question
and
you
will
get
up
feeling
stronger
and
henry
took
the
arm
of
his
friend
lincoln
led
him
home
and
saw
him
safely
in
bed
the
next
morning
the
doctor
called
at
lincoln
room
and
found
that
his
friend
had
passed
a
restless
night
excitement
had
brought
on
fever
which
threatened
to
assume
a
violent
form
as
the
cause
of
the
excitement
still
remained
several
days
passed
and
lincoln
was
confined
to
his
bed
henry
at
once
determined
to
call
on
miss
todd
and
find
out
how
desperate
the
case
was
miss
todd
was
glad
to
see
him
and
she
was
deeply
distressed
to
learn
that
lincoln
was
she
wished
to
go
to
him
at
once
but
the
doctor
reminded
her
that
she
was
the
cause
of
his
illness
she
frankly
acknowledged
her
folly
saying
that
she
only
desired
to
test
the
sincerity
of
lincoln
love
that
he
was
the
idol
of
her
heart
and
that
she
would
become
his
wife
the
doctor
returned
with
joyful
news
to
his
patient
the
intelligence
proved
the
best
remedy
for
the
disease
mutual
explanations
followed
and
in
a
few
months
lincoln
led
miss
todd
to
the
altar
in
triumph
i
learned
these
facts
from
henry
and
lincoln
i
believe
them
to
be
facts
and
as
such
have
recorded
them
they
do
not
agree
with
herndon
story
that
lincoln
never
loved
but
one
woman
and
that
woman
was
ann
rutledge
but
then
herndon
story
must
be
looked
upon
as
a
pleasant
piece
of
fiction
when
it
appeared
lincoln
felt
shocked
that
one
who
pretended
to
be
the
friend
of
her
dead
husband
should
deliberately
seek
to
blacken
his
memory
lincoln
was
far
too
honest
a
man
to
marry
a
woman
that
he
did
not
love
he
was
a
kind
and
an
indulgent
husband
and
when
he
saw
faults
in
his
wife
he
excused
them
as
he
would
excuse
the
impulsive
acts
of
a
child
in
fact
lincoln
was
never
more
pleased
than
when
the
president
called
her
his
before
closing
this
rambling
chapter
i
desire
to
refer
to
another
incident
after
the
death
of
my
son
miss
mary
welsh
a
dear
friend
one
of
my
old
louis
patrons
called
to
see
me
and
on
broaching
the
cause
of
my
grief
she
condoled
with
me
she
knew
that
i
had
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
my
son
would
be
a
support
to
me
knew
that
he
was
to
become
the
prop
and
of
my
old
age
and
knowing
this
she
advised
me
to
apply
for
a
pension
i
disliked
the
idea
very
much
and
told
her
so
told
her
that
i
did
not
want
to
make
money
out
of
his
death
she
explained
away
all
of
my
objections
argued
that
congress
had
made
an
appropriation
for
the
specific
purpose
of
giving
a
pension
to
every
widow
who
should
lose
an
only
son
in
the
war
and
insisted
that
i
should
have
my
rights
she
was
so
enthusiastic
in
the
matter
that
she
went
to
see
hon
owen
lovejoy
then
a
member
of
the
house
from
illinois
and
laid
my
case
before
him
lovejoy
was
very
kind
and
said
as
i
was
entitled
to
the
pension
i
should
have
it
even
if
he
had
to
bring
the
subject
before
congress
i
did
not
desire
public
agitation
and
lovejoy
prepared
my
claim
and
laid
it
before
the
commissioners
in
the
meantime
he
left
washington
and
joseph
lovejoy
his
brother
prosecuted
the
claim
for
me
and
finally
succeeded
in
securing
me
a
pension
of
eight
dollars
per
month
joseph
lovejoy
was
inclined
to
the
democratic
party
and
he
pressed
my
claim
with
great
earnestness
he
hoped
that
the
claim
would
not
be
allowed
as
he
said
the
rejection
of
it
would
make
capital
for
his
party
nevertheless
the
pension
was
granted
and
i
am
none
the
less
thankful
to
joseph
lovejoy
for
his
kindness
to
me
and
interest
in
my
welfare
chapter
xiv
old
friends
in
order
to
introduce
a
pleasant
chapter
of
my
life
i
must
take
a
slight
retrospective
glance
ann
e
garland
the
mistress
from
whom
i
purchased
my
freedom
in
louis
had
five
daughters
all
lovely
attractive
girls
i
used
to
take
pride
in
dressing
the
two
eldest
miss
mary
and
miss
carrie
for
parties
though
the
family
labored
under
pecuniary
embarrassment
i
worked
for
these
two
young
girls
and
they
were
always
able
to
present
a
good
appearance
in
society
they
were
much
admired
and
both
made
the
best
matches
of
the
season
miss
mary
married
pappan
and
miss
carrie
john
farrow
i
loved
them
both
tenderly
and
they
were
warmly
attached
to
me
both
are
now
dead
and
when
the
was
gathering
in
the
eyes
each
called
for
me
and
asked
to
die
in
my
arms
miss
carrie
did
not
long
survive
her
sister
and
i
wept
many
tears
over
the
of
the
two
lovely
flowers
that
had
blossomed
so
sweetly
beneath
my
eyes
each
breathed
her
last
in
the
arms
that
had
sheltered
them
so
often
in
the
bright
rosy
period
of
life
my
mother
took
care
of
my
son
and
miss
nannie
garland
the
fourth
daughter
when
a
wee
thing
became
my
especial
charge
she
slept
in
my
bed
and
i
watched
over
her
as
if
she
had
been
my
own
child
she
called
me
yiddie
and
i
could
not
have
loved
her
more
tenderly
had
she
been
the
sister
of
my
unfortunate
boy
she
was
about
twelve
years
old
when
i
purchased
my
freedom
and
resigned
my
charge
to
other
hands
after
garland
death
the
widow
moved
to
vicksburg
mississippi
and
i
lost
sight
of
the
family
for
a
few
years
my
mother
accompanied
them
to
vicksburg
where
she
died
i
made
two
visits
to
vicksburg
as
a
free
woman
the
object
of
my
second
visit
being
to
look
after
the
few
effects
left
by
my
mother
as
i
did
not
visit
my
mother
grave
at
the
time
the
garlands
were
much
surprised
but
i
offered
no
explanation
the
reason
is
not
difficult
to
understand
my
mother
was
buried
in
a
public
ground
and
the
marks
of
her
grave
as
i
learned
were
so
obscure
that
the
spot
could
not
be
readily
designated
to
look
upon
a
grave
and
not
feel
certain
whose
ashes
repose
beneath
the
sod
is
painful
and
the
doubt
which
mystifies
you
weakens
the
force
if
not
the
purity
of
the
from
the
heart
memory
preserved
a
sunny
picture
of
my
mother
face
and
i
did
not
wish
to
weave
sombre
threads
threads
suggestive
of
a
deserted
into
it
and
thus
impair
its
beauty
after
spending
a
few
weeks
with
the
family
i
returned
to
louis
and
then
came
north
the
war
broke
out
and
i
lost
all
trace
of
the
garlands
often
during
my
residence
in
washington
i
recalled
the
past
and
wondered
what
had
become
of
those
who
claimed
my
first
duty
and
my
first
love
when
i
would
mention
their
names
and
express
interest
in
their
welfare
my
northern
friends
would
roll
up
their
eyes
in
surprise
why
lizzie
how
can
you
have
a
kind
thought
for
those
who
inflicted
a
terrible
wrong
upon
you
by
keeping
you
in
bondage
they
would
ask
you
forget
the
past
is
dear
to
every
one
for
to
the
past
belongs
that
golden
period
the
days
of
childhood
the
past
is
a
mirror
that
reflects
the
chief
incidents
of
my
life
to
surrender
it
is
to
surrender
the
greatest
part
of
my
existence
early
impressions
friends
and
the
graves
of
my
father
my
mother
and
my
son
these
people
are
associated
with
everything
that
memory
holds
dear
and
so
long
as
memory
proves
faithful
it
is
but
natural
that
i
should
sigh
to
see
them
once
more
but
they
have
forgotten
you
they
are
too
selfish
to
give
a
single
thought
to
you
now
that
you
no
longer
are
their
slave
perhaps
so
but
i
can
not
believe
it
you
do
not
know
the
southern
people
as
well
as
i
do
how
warm
is
the
attachment
between
master
and
slave
my
northern
friends
could
not
understand
the
feeling
therefore
explanation
was
next
to
useless
they
would
listen
with
impatience
and
remark
at
the
close
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
you
have
some
strange
notions
lizzie
in
the
fall
of
a
lady
called
on
me
at
my
apartments
in
washington
her
face
looked
familiar
but
i
could
not
place
her
when
i
entered
the
room
she
came
towards
me
eagerly
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
i
know
i
am
just
from
lynchburg
and
when
i
left
cousin
ann
e
i
promised
to
call
and
see
you
if
i
came
to
washington

am
here

see
according
to
promise
i
was
more
bewildered
than
ever

not
recognize
me

so
glad
to
see

miss
ann

always
called
my
last
mistress

poor
hugh

sad
news
as
well
as
pleasant
and
so
my
little
pet

can
hardly
believe
it
she
was
only
a
child
when
i
saw
her
last
yes
nannie
is
married
to
a
noble
man
general
meem
belongs
to
one
of
the
best
families
in
virginia
they
are
now
living
at
rude
hill
up
beyond
winchester
in
the
shenandoah
valley
all
of
them
want
to
see
you
very
badly
i
should
be
delighted
to
go
to
them
miss
bettie
i
can
hardly
realize
that
you
are
the
wife
of
general
longstreet
and
just
think
you
are
now
sitting
in
the
very
chair
and
the
very
room
where
lincoln
has
often
sat
she
laughed
the
change
is
a
great
one
lizzie
we
little
dream
what
will
bring
forth
well
we
must
take
a
philosophical
view
of
life
after
fighting
so
long
against
the
yankees
general
longstreet
is
now
in
washington
sueing
for
pardon
and
we
propose
to
live
in
peace
with
the
united
states
again
i
had
many
questions
to
ask
her
about
old
friends
and
the
time
passed
rapidly
she
greeted
me
with
the
frankness
that
she
had
always
extended
to
me
and
i
was
transported
to
days
of
the
her
stay
in
washington
was
brief
as
the
general
arranged
his
business
and
they
left
the
capital
the
next
day
longstreet
gave
me
the
garlands
address
and
i
wrote
to
them
expressing
the
hope
that
i
would
be
able
to
see
them
before
long
in
reply
came
letters
full
of
tender
sympathy
and
affection
in
the
winter
of
miss
nannie
wrote
to
me
that
she
had
the
best
husband
in
the
world
that
they
designed
going
to
housekeeping
in
the
spring
and
that
they
would
be
glad
to
have
me
make
them
a
visit
in
july
she
sent
me
a
pressing
invitation
you
must
come
to
me
dear
lizzie
she
wrote
we
are
now
living
at
rude
hill
i
am
dying
to
see
you
ma
maggie
spot
and
minnie
sister
mary
child
are
with
me
and
you
only
are
needed
to
make
the
circle
complete
come
i
will
not
take
no
for
an
answer
i
was
anxious
to
go
myself
and
when
i
received
the
urgent
invitation
i
concluded
to
go
at
once
and
i
wrote
them
to
expect
me
in
august
on
the
of
august
i
left
washington
for
virginia
taking
the
train
for
harper
ferry
the
journey
was
attended
with
several
disappointments
we
arrived
at
harper
ferry
in
the
night
and
being
asleep
at
the
time
i
was
carried
to
the
station
beyond
where
i
had
to
wait
and
take
the
return
train
after
returning
to
harper
ferry
where
i
changed
cars
for
winchester
i
missed
the
train
and
was
detained
another
day
from
winchester
the
only
way
to
reach
rude
hill
was
by
a
line
of
stages
we
commenced
the
weary
drive
in
the
evening
and
rode
all
night
a
young
gentleman
in
the
stage
said
that
he
knew
general
meem
well
and
that
he
would
tell
me
when
we
reached
the
place
relying
upon
him
i
went
to
sleep
and
it
appears
that
the
polite
young
gentleman
followed
my
example
about
four
in
the
morning
one
of
the
passengers
shook
me
and
asked
aunty
do
you
want
to
get
out
at
rude
hill
i
started
up
rubbing
my
eyes
yes
are
we
there
more
than
there
we
have
passed
it
passed
it
yes
it
is
six
miles
back
you
should
not
sleep
so
soundly
aunty
why
you
not
tell
me
sooner
i
am
anxious
to
be
there
fact
is
i
forgot
it
never
mind
get
out
at
this
village
and
you
can
find
conveyance
back
the
village
new
market
was
in
a
dilapidated
condition
everything
about
it
spoke
plainly
of
the
sad
destruction
of
war
getting
out
of
the
stage
i
went
into
a
house
by
courtesy
named
a
hotel
where
i
obtained
a
cup
of
coffee
is
there
no
conveyance
from
here
to
rude
hill
i
asked
yes
the
stage
returns
this
evening
answered
the
landlord
this
evening
i
want
to
go
as
soon
as
possible
i
should
die
if
i
had
to
stay
all
day
in
this
lonely
place
a
colored
man
behind
the
bar
seeing
how
earnest
i
was
came
forward
and
informed
me
that
he
would
drive
me
over
to
general
meem
place
in
an
hour
this
was
joyful
news
and
i
urged
him
to
get
ready
to
start
as
soon
as
possible
while
standing
in
the
door
of
the
hotel
impatiently
waiting
for
my
colored
friend
to
drive
round
with
his
little
wagon
a
fat
old
lady
waddled
across
the
street
and
greeted
me
ai
you
lizzie
yes
i
answered
surprised
that
she
should
know
my
name
i
thought
so
they
have
been
expecting
you
at
rude
hill
every
day
for
two
weeks
and
they
do
but
little
but
talk
about
you
meem
was
in
town
yesterday
and
she
said
that
she
expected
you
this
week
certain
they
will
be
mighty
glad
to
see
you
why
will
you
believe
it
they
actually
have
kept
a
light
burning
in
the
front
window
every
night
for
ten
nights
in
order
that
you
might
not
go
by
the
place
should
you
arrive
in
the
night
thank
you
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
i
am
expected
i
fell
asleep
in
the
stage
and
failed
to
see
the
light
so
am
here
instead
of
at
hill
just
then
the
colored
man
drove
up
with
the
wagon
and
i
got
in
with
him
and
was
soon
on
the
road
to
general
meem
as
we
drove
up
to
rude
hill
i
observed
a
young
man
standing
in
the
yard
and
believing
it
to
be
spot
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
eight
years
i
beckoned
to
him
with
an
exclamation
of
joy
he
came
running
towards
me
his
movements
attracted
the
attention
of
the
family
and
in
a
minute
the
door
was
crowded
with
anxious
inquiring
faces
it
is
lizzie
it
is
lizzie
was
the
happy
cry
from
all
parties
in
my
eagerness
to
get
to
them
i
stepped
from
the
wagon
to
the
top
of
the
stile
intending
to
make
a
triumphant
leap
into
the
yard
but
alas
my
exultation
was
brief
my
caught
on
one
of
the
posts
and
i
fell
sprawling
into
the
yard
spot
reached
me
first
and
picked
me
up
only
to
put
me
into
the
arms
of
miss
nannie
her
sister
maggie
and
garland
could
my
friends
of
the
north
have
seen
that
meeting
they
would
never
have
doubted
again
that
the
mistress
had
any
affection
for
her
former
slave
i
was
carried
to
the
house
in
triumph
in
the
parlor
i
was
divested
of
my
things
and
placed
in
an
before
a
bright
fire
the
servants
looked
on
in
amazement
lizzie
you
are
not
changed
a
bit
you
look
as
young
as
when
you
left
us
in
louis
years
ago
and
meem
my
foster
child
kissed
me
again
here
lizzie
this
is
minnie
minnie
pappan
sister
mary
child
has
she
grown
and
miss
maggie
led
a
tall
queenly
lady
up
to
me
minnie
poor
dear
miss
mary
child
i
can
hardly
believe
it
she
was
only
a
baby
when
i
saw
her
last
it
makes
me
feel
old
to
see
how
large
she
has
grown
miss
minnie
you
are
larger
than
your
mother
was
your
dear
mother
whom
i
held
in
my
arms
when
she
died
and
i
brushed
a
tear
from
each
of
my
eyes
have
you
had
your
breakfast
lizzie
asked
garland
no
she
has
not
exclaimed
her
children
in
a
chorus
i
will
get
her
breakfast
for
her
and
nannie
maggie
and
minnie
started
for
the
kitchen
it
is
not
necessary
that
all
should
go
said
garland
here
is
the
cook
she
will
get
breakfast
ready
but
the
three
did
not
heed
her
all
rushed
to
the
kitchen
and
soon
brought
me
a
nice
hot
breakfast
while
i
was
eating
the
cook
remarked
i
declar
i
nebber
did
see
people
carry
on
so
wonder
if
i
should
go
off
and
stay
two
or
three
years
if
all
ob
you
wud
hug
and
kiss
me
so
when
i
cum
back
after
i
had
finished
my
breakfast
general
meem
came
in
he
greeted
me
warmly
lizzie
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
i
feel
that
you
are
an
old
acquaintance
i
have
heard
so
much
of
you
through
my
wife
her
sister
and
her
mother
welcome
to
rude
hill
i
was
much
pleased
with
his
appearance
and
closer
acquaintance
proved
him
to
be
a
model
gentleman
rude
hill
during
the
war
was
once
occupied
by
general
stonewall
jackson
for
his
which
gave
more
than
ordinary
interest
to
the
place
the
location
was
delightful
but
the
marks
of
war
could
be
seen
everywhere
on
the
plantation
general
meem
was
engaged
in
planting
and
he
employed
a
large
number
of
servants
to
assist
him
in
his
work
about
a
mile
from
rude
hill
was
mount
airy
the
elegant
of
the
general
brother
the
two
families
visited
each
other
a
great
deal
and
as
both
entertained
plenty
of
company
the
autumn
months
passed
pleasantly
i
was
comfortably
quartered
at
rude
hill
and
was
shown
every
attention
we
sewed
together
talking
of
old
times
and
every
day
either
drove
out
or
rode
on
horseback
the
room
in
which
i
sat
in
the
daytime
was
the
room
that
general
jackson
always
slept
in
and
people
came
from
far
and
near
to
look
at
it
general
jackson
was
the
ideal
soldier
of
the
southern
people
and
they
worshipped
him
as
an
idol
every
visitor
would
tear
a
splinter
from
the
walls
or
windows
of
the
room
to
take
away
and
treasure
as
a
priceless
relic
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
discover
that
i
was
an
object
of
great
curiosity
in
the
neighborhood
my
association
with
lincoln
and
my
attachment
for
the
garlands
whose
slave
i
had
once
been
clothed
me
with
romantic
interest
colonel
harry
gilmore
well
known
as
a
partisan
leader
in
maryland
and
virginia
during
the
war
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
mount
airy
and
hill
one
day
i
accompanied
a
party
to
a
tournament
and
general
meem
laughed
pleasantly
over
the
change
that
had
come
to
me
in
so
short
a
time
why
lizzie
you
are
riding
with
colonel
gilmore
just
think
of
the
change
from
lincoln
to
gilmore
it
sounds
like
a
dream
but
then
the
change
is
an
evidence
of
the
peaceful
feeling
of
this
country
a
change
i
trust
that
augurs
brighter
days
for
us
all
i
had
many
long
talks
with
garland
in
one
of
which
i
asked
what
had
become
of
the
only
sister
of
my
mother
formerly
maid
to
mother
she
is
dead
lizzie
has
been
dead
for
some
years
a
maid
in
the
old
time
meant
something
different
from
what
we
understand
by
a
maid
at
the
present
time
your
aunt
used
to
scrub
the
floor
and
milk
a
cow
now
and
then
as
well
as
attend
to
the
orders
of
my
mother
my
mother
was
severe
with
her
slaves
in
some
respects
but
then
her
heart
was
full
of
kindness
she
had
your
aunt
punished
one
day
and
not
liking
her
sorrowful
look
she
made
two
extravagant
promises
in
order
to
effect
a
reconciliation
both
of
which
were
accepted
on
condition
that
her
maid
would
look
cheerful
and
be
good
and
friendly
with
her
the
mistress
told
her
she
might
go
to
church
the
following
sunday
and
that
she
would
give
her
a
silk
dress
to
wear
on
the
occasion
now
my
mother
had
but
one
silk
dress
in
the
world
silk
not
being
so
plenty
in
those
days
as
it
is
now
and
yet
she
gave
this
dress
to
her
maid
to
make
friends
with
her
two
weeks
afterward
mother
was
sent
for
to
spend
the
day
at
a
house
and
on
inspecting
her
wardrobe
discovered
that
she
had
no
dress
fit
to
wear
in
company
she
had
but
one
alternative
and
that
was
to
appeal
to
the
generosity
of
your
aunt
charlotte
charlotte
was
summoned
and
enlightened
in
regard
to
the
situation
the
maid
proffered
to
loan
the
silk
dress
to
her
mistress
for
the
occasion
and
the
mistress
was
only
too
glad
to
accept
she
made
her
appearance
at
the
social
gathering
duly
arrayed
in
the
silk
that
her
maid
had
worn
to
church
on
the
preceding
sunday
we
laughed
over
the
incident
when
garland
said
lizzie
during
the
entire
war
i
used
to
think
of
you
every
day
and
have
longed
to
see
you
so
much
when
we
heard
you
were
with
lincoln
the
people
used
to
tell
me
that
i
was
foolish
to
think
of
ever
seeing
you
again
that
your
head
must
be
completely
turned
but
i
knew
your
heart
and
could
not
believe
that
you
would
forget
us
i
always
argued
that
you
would
come
and
see
us
some
day
you
judged
me
rightly
miss
ann
e
how
could
i
forget
you
whom
i
had
grown
up
with
from
infancy
northern
people
used
to
tell
me
that
you
would
forget
me
but
i
told
them
i
knew
better
and
hoped
on
ah
love
is
too
strong
to
be
blown
away
like
gossamer
threads
the
chain
is
strong
enough
to
bind
life
even
to
the
world
beyond
the
grave
do
you
always
feel
kindly
towards
me
lizzie
to
tell
you
candidly
miss
ann
e
i
have
but
one
unkind
thought
and
that
is
that
you
did
not
give
me
the
advantages
of
a
good
education
what
i
have
learned
has
been
the
study
of
after
years
you
are
right
i
did
not
look
at
things
then
as
i
do
now
i
have
always
regretted
that
you
were
not
educated
when
a
girl
but
you
have
not
suffered
much
on
this
score
since
you
get
along
in
the
world
better
than
we
who
enjoyed
every
educational
advantage
in
childhood
i
remained
five
weeks
at
rude
hill
and
they
were
five
of
the
most
delightful
weeks
of
my
life
i
designed
going
direct
to
richmond
but
the
cholera
was
reported
to
be
raging
in
that
city
so
i
took
the
train
for
baltimore
in
baltimore
i
stopped
with
annette
jordan
garland
had
given
me
a
letter
to
douglas
gordon
who
introduced
me
to
several
baltimore
ladies
among
others
mrs
doctor
thomas
who
said
to
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
lizzie
you
deserve
to
meet
with
success
for
having
been
so
kind
to
our
friends
in
the
days
of
the
past
i
wish
there
were
more
women
in
the
world
like
you
i
will
always
do
what
little
i
can
to
promote
your
welfare
after
remaining
in
baltimore
a
few
days
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
could
do
better
in
washington
so
i
returned
to
the
capital
and
reopened
my
business
in
the
spring
of
miss
maggie
garland
paid
a
visit
to
baltimore
before
leaving
virginia
she
said
to
some
of
her
friends
in
lynchburg
that
she
designed
going
by
washington
to
see
lizzie
her
friends
ridiculed
the
idea
but
she
persisted
i
love
lizzie
next
to
mother
she
has
been
a
mother
to
us
all
half
the
pleasure
of
my
visit
is
that
i
will
be
able
to
see
her
she
wrote
me
a
letter
saying
that
she
designed
visiting
me
asking
if
it
would
be
agreeable
i
replied
yes
come
by
all
means
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
see
you
she
came
and
stayed
at
my
rooms
and
expressed
surprise
to
find
me
so
comfortably
fixed
i
can
not
do
better
than
conclude
this
chapter
with
two
letters
from
my
dear
young
friends
the
first
from
general
meem
and
the
second
from
miss
maggie
garland
these
letters
show
the
goodness
of
their
hearts
and
the
frankness
of
their
natures
i
trust
that
they
will
not
object
to
the
publicity
that
i
give
them
rude
hill
my
dear
lizzie
i
am
nearly
ashamed
of
myself
for
neglecting
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
your
letter
and
the
very
acceptable
box
of
patterns
some
weeks
ago
but
you
will
pardon
my
remissness
i
know
for
you
can
imagine
what
a
busy
time
i
had
all
summer
with
a
house
full
of
company
most
of
the
time
and
with
very
inefficient
servants
and
in
some
departments
at
so
i
have
had
to
be
at
times
servant
and
the
last
and
most
difficult
but
i
have
turned
that
department
over
to
our
gardener
who
though
as
green
at
the
business
as
myself
seems
willing
to
learn
and
has
been
doing
the
milking
all
summer
these
are
a
of
the
reasons
why
i
have
not
written
to
you
before
for
i
hope
you
will
always
believe
that
you
occupy
a
large
place
in
my
memory
and
affection
whether
i
write
to
you
or
not
and
such
a
poor
correspondent
as
yourself
ought
not
to
complain
mother
mag
uncle
john
and
spot
are
still
with
us
the
former
will
pass
the
winter
with
me
but
the
others
all
talk
of
leaving
before
long
the
approach
of
winter
always
scatters
our
guests
and
we
have
to
spend
the
long
dreary
winters
alone
but
we
are
to
have
the
railroad
to
mt
jackson
by
christmas
perhaps
sooner
and
then
if
we
can
raise
the
wind
we
can
spend
a
portion
of
the
winter
in
the
city
and
i
hope
you
will
find
time
to
come
up
and
the
with
me
as
we
will
be
near
neighbors
i
so
seldom
indulge
in
the
pleasant
task
of
writing
letters
that
i
scarcely
know
what
will
interest
my
correspondent
but
i
flatter
myself
that
will
be
glad
to
hear
anything
and
everything
about
us
all
so
i
begin
with
the
children
hugh
has
improved
a
great
deal
and
is
acknowledged
to
be
the
smartest
child
and
the
finest
looking
in
the
state
he
talks
as
plainly
as
i
do
and
just
as
understandingly
as
a
child
of
ten
years
old
his
nurse
often
says
we
need
not
set
our
hearts
on
that
child
he
is
too
smart
ever
to
be
raised
but
i
trust
his
will
save
him
for
he
is
terribly
spoilt
as
such
interesting
children
are
bound
to
be
miss
eliza
no
longer
called
is
getting
to
be
a
little
girl
as
her
papa
calls
her
she
is
just
learning
to
walk
and
says
a
good
many
words
quite
plainly
you
would
never
take
her
for
the
same
little
of
last
summer
and
she
is
a
little
beauty
too
as
white
as
the
driven
snow
with
the
most
beautiful
blue
eyes
and
long
dark
lashes
you
ever
saw
she
will
set
crazy
if
she
grows
up
to
be
as
lovely
as
she
now
promises
to
be
my
dear
good
husband
has
been
like
myself
run
to
death
this
summer
but
it
agrees
with
him
and
i
never
saw
him
looking
better
he
has
fallen
off
a
little
which
is
a
great
improvement
i
think
he
often
speaks
of
you
and
wonders
if
you
were
sufficiently
pleased
with
your
visit
last
summer
to
repeat
it
i
hope
so
for
we
will
always
be
glad
to
welcome
you
to
rude
hill
whenever
you
have
time
to
come
provided
of
course
you
have
the
wish
also
spot
expects
to
hang
out
his
shingle
in
louis
next
winter
his
health
is
greatly
improved
though
he
is
still
very
thin
and
very
very
much
like
dear
father
mag
has
promised
to
teach
a
little
cousin
of
ours
who
lives
in
nelson
county
until
february
and
will
leave
here
in
two
weeks
to
commence
her
labors
i
hate
to
see
her
leave
but
she
is
bent
on
it
and
our
winters
are
so
unattractive
that
i
do
not
like
to
insist
on
her
shutting
herself
up
all
winter
with
three
old
people
she
will
have
very
pleasant
society
at
cousin
buller
and
will
perhaps
spend
the
rest
of
the
winter
with
aunt
pris
if
uncle
armistead
remains
in
binghampton
new
york
as
he
talks
of
doing
do
write
to
me
before
you
get
too
busy
with
your
fall
and
winter
work
i
am
so
anxious
to
hear
all
your
plans
and
about
your
stay
in
new
york
by
the
by
i
will
have
to
direct
this
to
washington
as
i
do
not
know
your
new
york
address
i
suppose
your
friends
will
forward
it
if
you
are
going
to
remain
any
length
of
time
in
new
york
send
me
your
address
and
i
will
write
again
i
have
somehow
made
out
a
long
letter
though
there
is
not
much
in
it
and
i
hope
you
will
do
the
same
before
long
send
love
yours
affectionately
meem
my
pen
and
ink
are
both
so
wretched
that
i
fear
you
will
find
some
difficulty
in
making
out
this
scratch
but
on
your
and
what
you
ca
read
just
guess
at
i
enclose
a
very
poor
likeness
of
hugh
taken
last
spring
show
it
to
anybody
for
i
assure
you
there
is
scarcely
the
faintest
resemblance
to
him
now
in
it
i
give
only
a
few
extracts
from
the
pleasant
letter
from
miss
maggie
garland
the
reader
will
observe
that
she
signs
herself
your
child
mag
an
expression
of
love
warmly
appreciated
by
me
seddes
so
many
months
have
passed
my
dear
lizzie
since
i
was
cheered
by
a
sight
of
your
welcome
handwriting
that
i
must
find
out
what
is
the
matter
and
see
if
i
ca

chapter
xv
the
secret
history
of
lincoln
wardrobe
in
new
york
in
march
lincoln
wrote
to
me
from
chicago
that
as
her
income
was
insufficient
to
meet
her
expenses
she
would
be
obliged
to
give
up
her
house
in
the
city
and
return
to
boarding
she
said
that
she
had
struggled
long
enough
to
keep
up
appearances
and
that
the
mask
must
be
thrown
aside
i
have
not
the
means
she
wrote
to
meet
the
expenses
of
even
a
and
must
sell
out
and
secure
cheap
rooms
at
some
place
in
the
country
it
will
not
be
startling
news
to
you
my
dear
lizzie
to
learn
that
i
must
sell
a
portion
of
my
wardrobe
to
add
to
my
resources
so
as
to
enable
me
to
live
decently
for
you
remember
what
i
told
you
in
washington
as
well
as
what
you
understood
before
you
left
me
here
in
chicago
i
can
not
live
on
a
year
and
as
i
have
many
costly
things
which
i
shall
never
wear
i
might
as
well
turn
them
into
money
and
thus
add
to
my
income
and
make
my
circumstances
easier
it
is
humiliating
to
be
placed
in
such
a
position
but
as
i
am
in
the
position
i
must
extricate
myself
as
best
i
can
now
lizzie
i
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
it
is
imperative
that
i
should
do
something
for
my
relief
and
i
want
you
to
meet
me
in
new
york
between
the
of
august
and
the
of
september
next
to
assist
me
in
disposing
of
a
portion
of
my
wardrobe
i
knew
that
lincoln
income
was
small
and
also
knew
that
she
had
many
valuable
dresses
which
could
be
of
no
value
to
her
packed
away
in
boxes
and
trunks
i
was
confident
that
she
would
never
wear
the
dresses
again
and
thought
that
since
her
need
was
urgent
it
would
be
well
enough
to
dispose
of
them
quietly
and
believed
that
new
york
was
the
best
place
to
transact
a
delicate
business
of
the
kind
she
was
the
wife
of
abraham
lincoln
the
man
who
had
done
so
much
for
my
race
and
i
could
refuse
to
do
nothing
for
her
calculated
to
advance
her
interests
i
consented
to
render
lincoln
all
the
assistance
in
my
power
and
many
letters
passed
between
us
in
regard
to
the
best
way
to
proceed
it
was
finally
arranged
that
i
should
meet
her
in
new
york
about
the
middle
of
september
while
thinking
over
this
question
i
remembered
an
incident
of
the
white
house
when
we
were
packing
up
to
leave
washington
for
chicago
she
said
to
me
one
morning
lizzie
i
may
see
the
day
when
i
shall
be
obliged
to
sell
a
portion
of
my
wardrobe
if
congress
does
not
do
something
for
me
then
my
dresses
some
day
may
have
to
go
to
bring
food
into
my
mouth
and
the
mouths
of
my
children
i
also
remembered
of
having
said
to
me
at
different
times
in
the
years
of
and
that
her
expensive
dresses
might
prove
of
great
assistance
to
her
some
day
in
what
way
lincoln
i
do
not
understand
i
ejaculated
the
first
time
she
made
the
remark
to
me
very
simple
to
understand
lincoln
is
so
generous
that
he
will
not
save
anything
from
his
salary
and
i
expect
that
we
will
leave
the
white
house
poorer
than
when
we
came
into
it
and
should
such
be
the
case
i
will
have
no
further
need
for
an
expensive
wardrobe
and
it
will
be
policy
to
sell
it
off
i
thought
at
the
time
that
lincoln
was
borrowing
trouble
from
the
future
and
little
dreamed
that
the
event
which
she
so
dimly
foreshadowed
would
ever
come
to
pass
i
closed
my
business
about
the
of
september
and
made
every
arrangement
to
leave
washington
on
the
mission
proposed
on
the
of
september
i
received
a
letter
from
lincoln
postmarked
chicago
saying
that
she
should
leave
the
city
so
as
to
reach
new
york
on
the
night
of
the
and
directing
me
to
precede
her
to
the
metropolis
and
secure
rooms
for
her
at
the
denis
hotel
in
the
name
of
clarke
as
her
visit
was
to
be
the
contents
of
the
letter
were
startling
to
me
i
had
never
heard
of
the
denis
and
therefore
presumed
that
it
could
not
be
a
house
and
i
could
not
understand
why
lincoln
should
travel
without
protection
under
an
assumed
name
i
knew
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
engage
rooms
at
a
strange
hotel
for
a
person
whom
the
proprietors
knew
nothing
about
i
could
not
write
to
lincoln
since
she
would
be
on
the
road
to
new
york
before
a
letter
could
possibly
reach
chicago
i
could
not
telegraph
her
for
the
business
was
of
too
delicate
a
character
to
be
trusted
to
the
wires
that
would
whisper
the
secret
to
every
curious
operator
along
the
line
in
my
embarrassment
i
caught
at
a
slender
thread
of
hope
and
tried
to
derive
consolation
from
it
i
knew
lincoln
to
be
indecisive
about
some
things
and
i
hoped
that
she
might
change
her
mind
in
regard
to
the
strange
programme
proposed
and
at
the
last
moment
despatch
me
to
this
effect
the
and
then
the
of
september
passed
and
no
despatch
reached
me
so
on
the
i
made
all
haste
to
take
the
train
for
new
york
after
an
anxious
ride
i
reached
the
city
in
the
evening
and
when
i
stood
alone
in
the
streets
of
the
great
metropolis
my
heart
sank
within
me
i
was
in
an
embarrassing
situation
and
scarcely
knew
how
to
act
i
did
not
know
where
the
denis
hotel
was
and
was
not
certain
that
i
should
find
lincoln
there
after
i
should
go
to
it
i
walked
up
to
broadway
and
got
into
a
stage
going
up
town
with
the
intention
of
keeping
a
close
for
the
hotel
in
question
a
gentleman
occupied
the
seat
next
to
me
and
i
ventured
to
inquire
of
him
if
you
please
sir
can
you
tell
me
where
the
denis
hotel
is
yes
we
ride
past
it
in
the
stage
i
will
point
it
out
to
you
when
we
come
to
it
thank
you
sir
the
stage
rattled
up
the
street
and
after
a
while
the
gentleman
looked
out
of
the
window
and
said
this
is
the
denis
do
you
wish
to
get
out
here
thank
you
yes
sir
he
pulled
the
strap
and
the
next
minute
i
was
standing
on
the
pavement
i
pulled
a
bell
at
the
ladies
entrance
to
the
hotel
and
a
boy
coming
to
the
door
i
asked
is
a
lady
by
the
name
of
clarke
stopping
here
she
came
last
night
i
believe
i
do
not
know
i
will
ask
at
the
office
and
i
was
left
alone
the
boy
came
back
and
said
yes
clarke
is
here
do
you
want
to
see
her
yes
well
just
walk
round
there
she
is
down
here
now
i
did
not
know
where
round
there
exactly
was
but
i
concluded
to
go
forward
i
stopped
however
thinking
that
the
lady
might
be
in
the
parlor
with
company
and
pulling
out
a
card
asked
the
boy
to
take
it
to
her
she
heard
me
talking
and
came
into
the
hall
to
see
herself
my
dear
lizzie
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
she
exclaimed
coming
forward
and
giving
me
her
hand
i
have
just
received
your
note
i
had
written
her
that
i
should
join
her
on
the
and
have
been
trying
to
get
a
room
for
you
your
note
has
been
here
all
day
but
it
was
never
delivered
until
come
in
here
until
i
find
out
about
your
room
and
she
led
me
into
the
office
the
clerk
like
all
modern
hotel
clerks
was
exquisitely
arrayed
highly
perfumed
and
too
to
be
obliging
or
even
courteous
this
is
the
woman
i
told
you
about
i
want
a
good
room
for
her
lincoln
said
to
the
clerk
we
have
no
room
for
her
madam
was
the
pointed
rejoinder
but
she
must
have
a
room
she
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
want
a
room
for
her
adjoining
mine
we
have
no
room
for
her
on
your
floor
that
is
strange
sir
i
tell
you
that
she
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
am
sure
you
could
not
give
a
room
to
a
more
worthy
person
friend
of
yours
or
not
i
tell
you
we
have
no
room
for
her
on
your
floor
i
can
find
a
place
for
her
on
the
fifth
floor
that
sir
i
presume
will
be
a
vast
improvement
on
my
room
well
if
she
goes
to
the
fifth
floor
i
shall
go
too
sir
what
is
good
enough
for
her
is
good
enough
for
me
very
well
madam
shall
i
give
you
adjoining
rooms
and
send
your
baggage
up
yes
and
have
it
done
in
a
hurry
let
the
boy
show
us
up
come
elizabeth
and
turned
from
the
clerk
with
a
haughty
glance
and
we
commenced
climbing
the
stairs
i
thought
we
should
never
reach
the
top
and
when
we
did
reach
the
fifth
story
what
accommodations
little
rooms
scantily
furnished
i
never
expected
to
see
the
widow
of
president
lincoln
in
such
dingy
humble
quarters
how
provoking
lincoln
exclaimed
sitting
down
on
a
chair
when
we
had
reached
the
top
and
panting
from
the
effects
of
the
climbing
i
declare
i
never
saw
such
unaccommodating
people
just
to
think
of
them
sticking
us
away
up
here
in
the
attic
i
will
give
them
a
regular
going
over
in
the
morning
but
you
forget
they
do
not
know
you
lincoln
would
be
treated
differently
from
mrs
clarke
true
i
do
forget
well
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
put
up
with
the
annoyances
why
did
you
not
come
to
me
yesterday
lizzie
i
was
almost
crazy
when
i
reached
here
last
night
and
found
you
had
not
arrived
i
sat
down
and
wrote
you
a
note
i
felt
so
badly
imploring
you
to
come
to
me
immediately
this
note
was
afterwards
sent
to
me
from
washington
it
reads
as
follows
denis
hotel
broadway
wednesday
my
dear
lizzie
i
arrived
last
evening
in
utter
despair
finding
you
i
am
frightened
to
death
being
here
alone
come
i
pray
you
by
train
inquire
for
clarke
room
or
story
house
so
crowded
could
not
get
another
spot
i
wrote
you
especially
to
meet
me
here
last
evening
it
makes
me
wild
to
think
of
being
here
alone
come
by
without
fail
your
friend
lincoln
i
am
booked
clarke
inquire
for
other
come
i
will
pay
your
expenses
when
you
arrive
here
i
shall
not
leave
here
or
change
my
room
until
you
come
your
friend
do
not
leave
this
house
without
seeing
me
i
transcribe
the
letter
literally
in
reply
to
lincoln
last
question
i
explained
what
has
already
been
explained
to
the
reader
that
i
was
in
hope
she
would
change
her
mind
and
knew
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
secure
the
rooms
requested
for
a
person
unknown
to
the
proprietors
or
attachés
of
the
hotel
the
explanation
seemed
to
satisfy
her
turning
to
me
suddenly
she
exclaimed
you
have
not
had
your
dinner
lizzie
and
must
be
hungry
i
nearly
forgot
about
it
in
the
joy
of
seeing
you
you
must
go
down
to
the
table
right
away
she
pulled
the
and
a
servant
appearing
she
ordered
him
to
give
me
my
dinner
i
followed
him
and
he
led
me
into
the
and
seated
me
at
a
table
in
one
corner
of
the
room
i
was
giving
my
order
when
the
steward
came
forward
and
gruffly
said
you
are
in
the
wrong
room
i
was
brought
here
by
the
waiter
i
replied
it
makes
no
difference
i
will
find
you
another
place
where
you
can
eat
your
dinner
i
got
up
from
the
table
and
followed
him
and
when
outside
of
the
door
said
to
him
it
is
very
strange
that
you
should
permit
me
to
be
seated
at
the
table
in
the
only
for
the
sake
of
ordering
me
to
leave
it
the
next
moment
are
you
not
clarke
servant
was
his
abrupt
question
i
am
with
mrs
clarke
it
is
all
the
same
servants
are
not
allowed
to
eat
in
the
large
here
this
way
you
must
take
your
dinner
in
the
hall
hungry
and
humiliated
as
i
was
i
was
willing
to
follow
to
any
place
to
get
my
dinner
for
i
had
been
riding
all
day
and
had
not
tasted
a
mouthful
since
early
morning
on
reaching
the
servants
hall
we
found
the
door
of
the
room
locked
the
waiter
left
me
standing
in
the
passage
while
he
went
to
inform
the
clerk
of
the
fact
in
a
few
minutes
the
obsequious
clerk
came
blustering
down
the
hall
did
you
come
out
of
the
street
or
from
clarke
room
from
clarke
room
i
meekly
answered
my
gentle
words
seemed
to
quiet
him
and
then
he
explained
it
is
after
the
regular
hour
for
dinner
the
room
is
locked
up
and
annie
has
gone
out
with
the
key
my
pride
would
not
let
me
stand
longer
in
the
hall
very
well
i
remarked
as
i
began
climbing
the
stairs
i
will
tell
clarke
that
i
can
not
get
any
dinner
he
looked
after
me
with
a
scowl
on
his
face
you
need
not
put
on
airs
i
understand
the
whole
thing
i
said
nothing
but
continued
to
climb
the
stairs
thinking
to
myself
well
if
you
understand
the
whole
thing
it
is
strange
that
you
should
put
the
widow
of
abraham
lincoln
in
a
room
in
the
attic
of
this
miserable
hotel
when
i
reached
lincoln
rooms
tears
of
humiliation
and
vexation
were
in
my
eyes
what
is
the
matter
lizzie
she
asked
i
can
not
get
any
dinner
can
not
get
any
dinner
what
do
you
mean
i
then
told
her
of
all
that
had
transpired
below
the
insolent
overbearing
people
she
fiercely
exclaimed
never
mind
lizzie
you
shall
have
your
dinner
put
on
your
bonnet
and
shawl
what
for
what
for
why
we
will
go
out
of
the
hotel
and
get
you
something
to
eat
where
they
know
how
to
behave
decently
and
lincoln
already
was
tying
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
before
the
glass
her
impulsiveness
alarmed
me
surely
lincoln
you
do
not
intend
to
go
out
on
the
street
yes
i
do
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
have
you
starve
when
we
can
find
something
to
eat
on
every
corner
but
you
forget
you
are
here
as
clarke
and
not
as
lincoln
you
came
alone
and
the
people
already
suspect
that
everything
is
not
right
if
you
go
outside
of
the
hotel
they
will
accept
the
fact
as
evidence
against
you
nonsense
what
do
you
suppose
i
care
for
what
these
people
think
put
on
your
things
no
lincoln
i
shall
not
go
outside
of
the
hotel
for
i
realize
your
situation
if
you
do
not
lincoln
has
no
reason
to
care
what
these
people
may
say
about
her
as
lincoln
but
she
should
be
prudent
and
give
them
no
opportunity
to
say
anything
about
her
as
mrs
clarke
it
was
with
difficulty
i
could
convince
her
that
she
should
act
with
caution
she
was
so
frank
and
impulsive
that
she
never
once
thought
that
her
actions
might
be
misconstrued
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
she
might
order
dinner
to
be
served
in
my
room
so
i
went
to
bed
without
a
mouthful
to
eat
the
next
morning
lincoln
knocked
at
my
door
before
six
come
elizabeth
get
up
i
know
you
must
be
hungry
dress
yourself
quickly
and
we
will
go
out
and
get
some
breakfast
i
was
unable
to
sleep
last
night
for
thinking
of
you
being
forced
to
go
to
bed
without
anything
to
eat
i
dressed
myself
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
together
we
went
out
and
took
breakfast
at
a
restaurant
on
broadway
some
place
between
and
the
denis
hotel
i
do
not
give
the
number
as
i
prefer
leaving
it
to
conjecture
of
one
thing
i
am
certain
the
proprietor
of
the
restaurant
little
dreamed
who
one
of
his
guests
was
that
morning
after
breakfast
we
walked
up
broadway
and
entering
union
square
park
took
a
seat
on
one
of
the
benches
under
the
trees
watched
the
children
at
play
and
talked
over
the
situation
lincoln
told
me
lizzie
yesterday
morning
i
called
for
the
at
the
breakfast
table
and
on
looking
over
the
list
of
diamond
brokers
advertised
i
selected
the
firm
of
brady
broadway
after
breakfast
i
walked
down
to
the
house
and
tried
to
sell
them
a
lot
of
jewelry
i
gave
my
name
as
clarke
i
first
saw
judd
a
member
of
the
firm
a
very
pleasant
gentleman
we
were
unable
to
agree
about
the
price
he
went
back
into
the
office
where
a
stout
gentleman
was
seated
at
the
desk
but
i
could
not
hear
what
he
said
i
know
now
what
was
said
and
so
shall
the
reader
in
parentheses
brady
has
since
told
me
that
he
remarked
to
judd
that
the
woman
must
be
crazy
to
ask
such
outrageous
prices
and
to
get
rid
of
her
as
soon
as
possible
soon
after
judd
came
back
to
the
counter
another
gentleman
keyes
as
i
have
since
learned
a
silent
partner
in
the
house
entered
the
store
he
came
to
the
counter
and
in
looking
over
my
jewelry
discovered
my
name
inside
of
one
of
the
rings
i
had
forgotten
the
ring
and
when
i
saw
him
looking
at
the
name
so
earnestly
i
snatched
the
bauble
from
him
and
put
it
into
my
pocket
i
hastily
gathered
up
my
jewelry
and
started
out
they
asked
for
my
address
and
i
left
my
card
clarke
at
the
denis
hotel
they
are
to
call
to
see
me
this
forenoon
when
i
shall
enter
into
negotiations
with
them
scarcely
had
we
returned
to
the
hotel
when
keyes
called
and
clarke
disclosed
to
him
that
she
was
lincoln
he
was
much
elated
to
find
his
surmise
correct
exhibited
to
him
a
large
number
of
shawls
dresses
and
fine
laces
and
told
him
that
she
was
compelled
to
sell
them
in
order
to
live
he
was
an
earnest
republican
was
much
affected
by
her
story
and
denounced
the
ingratitude
of
the
government
in
the
severest
terms
she
complained
to
him
of
the
treatment
she
had
received
at
the
denis
and
he
advised
her
to
move
to
another
hotel
forthwith
she
readily
consented
and
as
she
wanted
to
be
in
an
place
where
she
would
not
be
recognized
by
any
of
her
old
friends
he
recommended
the
earle
hotel
in
canal
street
on
the
way
down
to
the
hotel
that
morning
she
acceded
to
a
suggestion
made
by
me
and
supported
by
keyes
that
she
confide
in
the
landlord
and
give
him
her
name
without
registering
so
as
to
ensure
the
proper
respect
unfortunately
the
earle
hotel
was
full
and
we
had
to
select
another
place
we
drove
to
the
union
place
hotel
where
we
secured
rooms
for
clarke
lincoln
changing
her
mind
deeming
it
would
not
be
prudent
to
disclose
her
real
name
to
any
one
after
we
had
become
settled
in
our
new
quarters
keyes
and
brady
called
frequently
on
lincoln
and
held
long
conferences
with
her
they
advised
her
to
pursue
the
course
she
did
and
were
sanguine
of
success
lincoln
was
very
anxious
to
dispose
of
her
things
and
return
to
chicago
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
possible
but
they
presented
the
case
in
a
different
light
and
i
regret
to
say
she
was
guided
by
their
counsel
pooh
said
brady
place
your
affairs
in
our
hands
and
we
will
raise
you
at
least
in
a
few
weeks
the
people
will
not
permit
the
widow
of
abraham
lincoln
to
suffer
they
will
come
to
her
rescue
when
they
know
she
is
in
want
the
argument
seemed
plausible
and
lincoln
quietly
acceded
to
the
proposals
of
keyes
and
brady
we
remained
quietly
at
the
union
place
hotel
for
a
few
days
on
sunday
lincoln
accepted
the
use
of
a
private
carriage
and
accompanied
by
me
she
drove
out
to
central
park
we
did
not
enjoy
the
ride
much
as
the
carriage
was
a
close
one
and
we
could
not
throw
open
the
window
for
fear
of
being
recognized
by
some
one
of
the
many
thousands
in
the
park
lincoln
wore
a
heavy
veil
so
as
to
more
effectually
conceal
her
face
we
came
near
being
run
into
and
we
had
a
spasm
of
alarm
for
an
accident
would
have
exposed
us
to
public
gaze
and
of
course
the
masquerade
would
have
been
at
an
end
on
tuesday
i
hunted
up
a
number
of
dealers
in
secondhand
clothing
and
had
them
call
at
the
hotel
by
appointment
lincoln
soon
discovered
that
they
were
hard
people
to
drive
a
bargain
with
so
on
thursday
we
got
into
a
close
carriage
taking
a
bundle
of
dresses
and
shawls
with
us
and
drove
to
a
number
of
stores
on
seventh
avenue
where
an
attempt
was
made
to
dispose
of
a
portion
of
the
wardrobe
the
dealers
wanted
the
goods
for
little
or
nothing
and
we
found
it
a
hard
matter
to
drive
a
bargain
with
them
lincoln
met
the
dealers
squarely
but
all
of
her
tact
and
shrewdness
failed
to
accomplish
much
i
do
not
care
to
dwell
upon
this
portion
of
my
story
let
it
answer
to
say
that
we
returned
to
the
hotel
more
disgusted
than
ever
with
the
business
in
which
we
were
engaged
there
was
much
curiosity
at
the
hotel
in
relation
to
us
as
our
movements
were
watched
and
we
were
regarded
with
suspicion
our
trunks
in
the
main
hall
below
were
examined
daily
and
curiosity
was
more
keenly
excited
when
the
reporters
for
the
press
traced
lincoln
name
on
the
cover
of
one
of
her
trunks
the
letters
had
been
rubbed
out
but
the
faint
outlines
remained
and
these
outlines
only
served
to
stimulate
curiosity
keyes
and
brady
called
often
and
they
made
lincoln
believe
that
if
she
would
write
certain
letters
for
them
to
show
to
prominent
politicians
they
could
raise
a
large
sum
of
money
for
her
they
argued
that
the
republican
party
would
never
permit
it
to
be
said
that
the
wife
of
abraham
lincoln
was
in
want
that
the
leaders
of
the
party
would
make
heavy
advances
rather
than
have
it
published
to
the
world
that
lincoln
poverty
compelled
her
to
sell
her
wardrobe
wants
were
urgent
as
she
had
to
borrow
from
keyes
and
brady
and
she
was
willing
to
adopt
any
scheme
which
promised
to
place
a
good
bank
account
to
her
credit
at
different
times
in
her
room
at
the
union
place
hotel
she
wrote
the
following
letters
chicago
brady
broker
no
broadway
new
i
have
this
day
sent
to
you
personal
property
which
i
am
compelled
to
part
with
and
which
you
will
find
of
considerable
value
the
articles
consist
of
four
camels
hair
shawls
one
lace
dress
and
shawl
a
parasol
cover
a
diamond
ring
two
dress
patterns
some
furs
etc
please
have
them
appraised
and
confer
by
letter
with
me
very
respectfully
mrs
lincoln
chicago
mr
brady
broadway
dear
sir
the
articles
i
am
sending
you
to
dispose
of
were
gifts
of
dear
friends
which
only
urgent
necessity
compels
me
to
part
with
and
i
am
especially
anxious
that
they
shall
not
be
sacrificed
the
circumstances
are
peculiar
and
painfully
embarrassing
therefore
i
hope
you
will
endeavor
to
realize
as
much
as
possible
for
them
hoping
to
hear
from
you
i
remain
very
respectfully
a
lincoln
brady
esq
my
great
great
sorrow
and
loss
have
made
me
painfully
sensitive
but
as
my
feelings
and
pecuniary
comforts
were
never
regarded
or
even
recognized
in
the
midst
of
my
overwhelming
bereavement
that
i
am
pressed
in
a
most
startling
manner
for
means
of
subsistence
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
shrink
from
an
opportunity
of
improving
my
trying
position
being
assured
that
all
you
do
will
be
appropriately
executed
and
in
a
manner
that
will
not
startle
me
very
greatly
and
excite
as
little
comment
as
possible
again
i
shall
leave
all
in
your
hands
i
am
passing
through
a
very
painful
ordeal
which
the
country
in
remembrance
of
my
noble
and
devoted
husband
should
have
spared
me
i
remain
with
great
respect
very
truly
lincoln
as
you
mention
that
my
goods
have
been
valued
at
over
i
will
be
willing
to
make
a
reduction
of
and
relinquish
them
for
if
this
is
not
accomplished
i
will
continue
to
sell
and
advertise
largely
until
every
article
is
sold
i
must
have
means
to
live
at
least
in
a
medium
comfortable
state
the
letters
are
dated
chicago
and
addressed
to
brady
though
every
one
of
them
was
written
in
new
york
for
when
left
the
west
for
the
east
she
had
settled
upon
no
definite
plan
of
action
brady
proposed
to
show
the
letters
to
certain
politicians
and
ask
for
money
on
a
threat
to
publish
them
if
his
demands
as
lincoln
agent
were
not
complied
with
when
writing
the
letters
i
stood
at
lincoln
elbow
and
suggested
that
they
be
couched
in
the
mildest
language
possible
never
mind
lizzie
she
said
anything
to
raise
the
wind
one
might
as
well
be
killed
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
this
latter
expression
was
a
favorite
one
of
hers
she
meaning
by
it
that
if
one
must
be
punished
for
an
act
such
as
theft
for
instance
that
the
punishment
would
be
no
more
severe
if
a
sheep
were
taken
instead
of
a
lamb
brady
exhibited
the
letters
quite
freely
but
the
parties
to
whom
they
were
shown
refused
to
make
any
advances
meanwhile
our
stay
at
the
union
place
hotel
excited
so
much
curiosity
that
a
sudden
movement
was
rendered
expedient
to
avoid
discovery
we
sent
the
large
trunks
to
broadway
packed
the
smaller
ones
paid
our
bills
at
the
hotel
and
one
morning
hastily
departed
for
the
country
where
we
remained
three
days
the
movement
was
successful
the
reporters
for
the
daily
papers
were
thrown
off
the
scent
and
when
we
returned
to
the
city
we
took
rooms
at
the
brandreth
house
where
lincoln
registered
as
mrs
morris
i
had
desired
her
to
go
to
the
metropolitan
hotel
and
confide
in
the
proprietors
as
the
leland
had
always
been
very
kind
to
her
treating
her
with
distinguished
courtesy
whenever
she
was
their
guest
but
this
she
refused
to
do
several
days
passed
and
brady
and
keyes
were
forced
to
acknowledge
that
their
scheme
was
a
failure
the
letters
had
been
shown
to
various
parties
but
every
one
declined
to
act
aside
from
a
few
dresses
sold
at
small
prices
to
secondhand
dealers
wardrobe
was
still
in
her
possession
her
visit
to
new
york
had
proved
disastrous
and
she
was
goaded
into
more
desperate
measures
money
she
must
have
and
to
obtain
it
she
proposed
to
play
a
bolder
game
she
gave
brady
permission
to
place
her
wardrobe
on
exhibition
for
sale
and
authorized
him
to
publish
the
letters
in
the
after
coming
to
this
determination
she
packed
her
trunks
to
return
to
chicago
i
accompanied
her
to
the
depot
and
told
her
on
the
very
morning
that
the
letters
appeared
in
the
lincoln
wrote
me
the
incidents
of
the
journey
and
the
letter
describes
the
story
more
graphically
than
i
could
hope
to
do
i
suppress
many
passages
as
they
are
of
too
confidential
a
nature
to
be
given
to
the
public
chicago
october
my
dear
lizzie
my
ink
is
like
myself
and
my
spirits
failing
so
i
write
you
with
a
pencil
i
had
a
solitary
ride
to
this
place
as
you
may
imagine
varied
by
one
or
two
amusing
incidents
i
found
after
you
left
me
i
could
not
continue
in
the
car
in
which
you
left
me
owing
to
every
seat
berth
being
engaged
so
being
simple
i
had
to
eat
in
a
car
less
commodious
my
thoughts
were
too
much
with
my
goods
and
at
broadway
to
care
much
for
my
surroundings
as
uncomfortable
as
they
were
in
front
of
me
sat
a
gentleman
who
for
the
whole
morning
had
the
page
of
the
before
him
which
contained
my
letters
and
business
concerns
about
four
hours
before
arriving
at
chicago
a
man
of
formidable
size
seated
himself
by
him
and
it
appears
they
were
entirely
unknown
to
each
other
the
looking
individual
opened
the
conversation
with
the
man
who
had
read
the
so
attentively
and
the
conversation
soon
grew
warm
and
earnest
the
war
and
its
devastation
engaged
them
the
bluffy
individual
doubtless
a
republican
who
had
pocketed
his
many
thousands
spoke
of
the
widows
of
the
land
made
so
by
the
war
my
reading
man
remarked
to
him
you
aware
that
lincoln
is
in
indigent
circumstances
and
has
to
sell
her
clothing
and
jewelry
to
gain
means
to
make
life
more
endurable
the
man
replied
do
not
blame
her
for
selling
her
clothing
if
she
wishes
it
i
suppose
she
will
convert
the
proceeds
into
to
enable
her
to
have
means
to
be
buried
the
man
turned
towards
him
with
a
searching
glance
and
replied
with
the
haughtiest
manner
woman
is
not
dead
yet
the
discomfited
individual
looked
down
never
spoke
another
word
and
in
half
an
hour
left
his
seat
and
did
not
return
i
give
you
word
for
word
as
the
conversation
occurred
may
it
be
found
through
the
execution
of
my
friends
brady
and
keyes
that
woman
is
not
yet
dead
and
being
alive
she
speaketh
and
gaineth
valuable
hearers
such
is
life
those
who
have
been
injured
how
gladly
the
injurer
would
consign
them
to
mother
earth
and
forgetfulness
hoping
i
should
not
be
recognized
at
fort
wayne
i
thought
i
would
get
out
at
dinner
for
a
cup
of
tea
will
show
you
what
a
creature
of
i
am
as
miserable
as
it
sometimes
is
i
went
into
the
alone
and
was
ushered
up
to
the
table
where
at
its
head
sat
a
very
gentleman
at
his
side
a
lady
my
black
veil
was
doubled
over
my
face
i
had
taken
my
seat
next
to
him
he
at
the
head
of
the
table
i
at
his
left
hand
i
immediately
a
pair
of
eyes
was
gazing
at
me
i
looked
him
full
in
the
face
and
the
glance
was
earnestly
returned
i
sipped
my
water
and
said
is
this
indeed
you
his
face
was
as
pale
as
the
we
entered
into
conversation
when
i
asked
him
how
long
since
he
had
left
chicago
he
replied
weeks
since
he
said
strange
you
should
be
on
the
train
and
i
not
know
it
as
soon
as
i
could
escape
from
the
table
i
did
so
by
saying
must
secure
a
cup
of
tea
for
a
lady
friend
with
me
who
has
a
i
had
scarcely
returned
to
the
car
when
he
entered
it
with
a
cup
of
tea
borne
by
his
own
aristocratic
hands
i
was
a
good
deal
annoyed
by
seeing
him
and
he
was
so
agitated
that
he
spilled
half
of
the
cup
over
my
hands
looked
very
sad
and
i
fancied
broadway
occupied
his
thoughts
i
apologized
for
the
absent
lady
who
wished
the
cup
by
saying
that
my
absence
she
had
slipped
out
for
it
his
heart
was
in
his
eyes
notwithstanding
my
veiled
face
pity
for
me
i
fear
has
something
to
do
with
all
this
i
never
saw
his
manner
gentle
and
sad
this
was
nearly
evening
and
i
did
not
see
him
again
as
he
returned
to
the
lady
who
was
his
from
the
east
what
evil
spirit
possessed
me
to
go
out
and
get
that
cup
of
tea
when
he
left
me
i
tossed
the
cup
of
tea
out
of
the
window
and
tucked
my
head
down
and
shed
at
the
depot
my
darling
little
taddie
was
waiting
for
me
and
his
voice
never
sounded
so
sweet
my
dear
lizzie
do
visit
brady
each
morning
at
nine
and
urge
them
all
you
can
i
see
by
the
papers
stewart
has
returned
i
will
send
the
invoice
of
goods
which
please
to
not
give
up
how
much
i
miss
you
tongue
can
not
tell
forget
my
fright
and
nervousness
of
the
evening
before
of
course
you
were
as
innocent
as
a
child
in
all
you
did
i
consider
you
my
best
living
friend
and
i
am
struggling
to
be
enabled
some
day
to
repay
you
write
me
often
as
you
promised
always
truly
yours
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
dwell
upon
the
public
history
of
lincoln
unfortunate
venture
the
question
has
been
discussed
in
all
the
newspapers
of
the
land
and
these
discussions
are
so
recent
that
it
would
be
useless
to
introduce
them
in
these
pages
even
if
i
had
an
inclination
to
do
so
the
following
from
the
new
york
briefly
tells
the
story
the
attraction
for
ladies
and
the
curious
and
speculative
of
the
other
sex
in
this
city
just
now
is
the
grand
exposition
of
lincoln
dresses
at
the
office
of
brady
on
broadway
a
few
doors
south
of
houston
street
the
publicity
given
to
the
articles
on
exhibition
and
for
sale
has
excited
the
public
curiosity
and
hundreds
of
people
principally
women
with
considerable
leisure
moments
at
disposal
daily
throng
the
rooms
of
brady
and
give
himself
and
his
more
to
do
than
either
bargained
for
when
a
lady
with
face
concealed
with
a
veil
called
and
arranged
for
the
sale
of
the
superabundant
clothing
of
a
distinguished
and
titled
but
nameless
lady
dresses
folded
or
tossed
about
by
frequent
examinations
lie
exposed
upon
a
closed
piano
and
upon
a
lounge
shawls
rich
and
rare
are
displayed
upon
the
backs
of
chairs
but
the
more
exacting
obtain
a
better
view
and
closer
inspection
by
the
lady
attendant
throwing
them
occasionally
upon
her
shoulders
just
to
oblige
so
that
their
appearance
on
promenade
might
be
seen
and
admired
furs
laces
and
jewelry
are
in
a
glass
case
but
the
thousand
dollars
in
gold
point
outfit
is
kept
in
a
box
and
only
shown
on
special
request
the
feeling
of
the
majority
of
visitors
is
adverse
to
the
course
lincoln
has
thought
proper
to
pursue
and
the
criticisms
are
as
severe
as
the
cavillings
are
persistent
at
the
quality
of
some
of
the
dresses
these
latter
are
labelled
at
lincoln
own
estimate
and
prices
range
from
to
about
per
cent
less
than
cost
some
of
them
if
not
worn
long
have
been
worn
much
they
are
jagged
under
the
arms
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
skirt
stains
are
on
the
lining
and
other
objections
present
themselves
to
those
who
oscillate
between
the
dresses
and
dollars
they
have
been
worn
by
madam
lincoln
as
a
lady
who
looked
from
behind
a
pair
of
gold
spectacles
remarked
other
dresses
however
have
scarcely
been
worn
one
perhaps
while
lincoln
sat
for
her
picture
and
from
one
the
basting
threads
had
not
yet
been
removed
the
general
testimony
is
that
the
wearing
apparel
is
and
some
of
the
examiners
say
that
the
must
have
been
put
on
by
the
dressmakers
or
if
such
was
not
the
case
that
gold
was
when
they
were
purchased
and
is
now
but
so
that
a
dress
for
which
was
paid
at
the
rate
of
high
figures
can
not
be
called
cheap
at
half
that
sum
after
it
has
been
worn
considerable
and
perhaps
passed
out
of
fashion
the
peculiarity
of
the
dresses
is
that
the
most
of
them
are
cut
a
taste
which
some
ladies
attribute
to
lincoln
appreciation
of
her
own
bust
on
saturday
last
an
offer
was
made
for
all
the
dresses
the
figure
named
was
less
than
the
aggregate
estimate
placed
on
them
brady
however
having
no
discretionary
power
he
declined
to
close
the
bargain
but
notified
lincoln
by
mail
of
course
as
yet
no
reply
has
been
received
desires
that
the
auction
should
be
deferred
till
the
of
the
present
month
and
efforts
made
to
dispose
of
the
articles
at
private
sale
up
to
that
time
a
c
called
on
brady
this
morning
and
examined
minutely
each
shawl
before
leaving
the
lady
said
that
at
the
time
when
there
was
a
hesitancy
about
the
president
issuing
the
emancipation
proclamation
she
sent
to
lincoln
an
shawl
which
was
manufactured
in
china
forwarded
to
france
and
thence
to
c
in
new
york
the
shawl
the
lady
remarked
was
a
very
handsome
one
and
should
it
come
into
the
hands
of
brady
to
be
sold
would
like
to
be
made
aware
of
the
fact
so
as
to
obtain
possession
again
brady
promised
to
acquaint
the
donor
if
the
prized
article
should
be
among
the
two
trunks
of
goods
now
on
the
way
from
chicago
so
many
erroneous
reports
were
circulated
that
i
made
a
correct
statement
to
one
of
the
editors
of
the
new
york
the
article
based
upon
the
memoranda
furnished
by
me
appeared
in
the
of
i
reproduce
a
portion
of
it
in
this
connection
lincoln
feels
sorely
aggrieved
at
many
of
the
harsh
criticisms
that
have
been
passed
upon
her
for
travelling
incognito
she
claims
that
she
adopted
this
course
from
motives
of
delicacy
desiring
to
avoid
publicity
while
here
she
spoke
to
but
two
former
acquaintances
and
these
two
gentlemen
whom
she
met
on
broadway
hundreds
passed
her
who
had
courted
her
good
graces
when
she
reigned
supreme
at
the
white
house
but
there
was
no
recognition
it
was
not
because
she
had
changed
much
in
personal
appearance
but
was
merely
owing
to
the
heavy
crape
veil
that
hid
her
features
from
view
she
seeks
to
defend
her
course
while
in
this
city
and
with
much
force
too
adverting
to
the
fact
that
the
empress
of
france
frequently
disposes
of
her
wardrobe
and
publicly
too
without
being
subjected
to
any
unkind
remarks
regarding
its
propriety
she
claims
the
same
immunity
here
as
is
accorded
in
paris
to
eugenie
as
regards
her
obscurity
while
in
this
city
she
says
that
foreigners
of
note
and
position
frequently
come
to
our
stores
and
under
assumed
names
travel
from
point
to
point
throughout
our
vast
domain
to
avoid
recognition
and
the
inconveniences
resulting
from
being
known
though
it
even
be
in
the
form
of
honors
for
herself
she
regards
quiet
preferable
to
ostentatious
show
which
would
have
cost
her
much
indirectly
if
not
directly
and
this
she
felt
herself
unable
to
bear
according
to
the
measure
of
her
present
state
of
finances
in
a
recent
letter
to
her
bosom
friend
elizabeth
keckley
lincoln
pathetically
remarks
if
evil
come
from
this
pray
for
my
deliverance
as
i
did
it
for
the
best
this
referred
to
her
action
in
placing
her
personal
effects
before
the
public
for
sale
and
to
the
harsh
remarks
that
have
been
made
thereon
by
some
whom
she
had
formerly
regarded
as
her
friends
as
to
the
articles
which
belonged
to
lincoln
they
can
all
be
accounted
for
in
a
manner
satisfactory
even
to
an
public
during
the
time
lincoln
was
in
office
he
was
the
recipient
of
several
canes
after
his
death
one
was
given
to
the
hon
charles
sumner
another
to
fred
douglass
another
to
the
rev
garnet
of
this
city
and
another
to
wm
slade
the
present
steward
of
the
white
house
who
in
lincoln
lifetime
was
his
messenger
this
gentleman
also
received
some
of
lincoln
apparel
among
which
was
his
heavy
gray
shawl
several
other
of
the
messengers
employed
about
the
white
house
came
in
for
a
share
of
the
deceased
president
effects
the
shepherd
plaid
shawl
which
lincoln
wore
during
the
milder
weather
and
which
was
rendered
somewhat
memorable
as
forming
part
of
his
famous
disguise
together
with
the
scotch
cap
when
he
wended
his
way
secretly
to
the
capitol
to
be
inaugurated
as
president
was
given
to
abbot
of
canada
who
had
been
one
of
his
warmest
friends
during
the
war
this
gentleman
as
a
surgeon
in
the
united
states
army
was
in
washington
in
charge
of
a
hospital
and
thus
became
acquainted
with
the
head
of
the
nation
his
watch
his
penknife
his
gold
pencil
and
his
glasses
are
now
in
possession
of
his
son
robert
nearly
all
else
than
these
few
things
have
passed
out
of
the
family
as
lincoln
did
not
wish
to
retain
them
but
all
were
freely
given
away
and
not
an
article
was
parted
with
for
money
the
rev
gurley
of
washington
was
the
spiritual
adviser
of
the
president
and
his
family
they
attended
his
church
when
little
died
he
officiated
at
the
funeral
he
was
a
most
intimate
friend
of
the
family
and
when
lincoln
lay
upon
his
gurley
was
by
his
side
he
as
his
clergyman
performed
the
funeral
rites
upon
the
body
of
the
deceased
president
when
it
lay
cold
in
death
at
the
city
of
washington
he
received
the
hat
worn
last
by
lincoln
as
we
have
before
stated
and
it
is
still
retained
by
him
the
dress
that
was
worn
by
lincoln
on
the
night
of
the
assassination
was
presented
to
wm
slade
it
is
a
black
silk
with
a
little
white
stripe
most
of
the
other
articles
that
adorned
lincoln
on
that
fatal
night
became
the
property
of
keckley
she
has
the
most
of
them
carefully
stowed
away
and
intends
keeping
them
during
her
life
as
mementos
of
a
mournful
event
the
principal
articles
among
these
are
the
earrings
the
bonnet
and
the
velvet
cloak
the
writer
of
this
saw
the
latter
on
thursday
it
bears
most
palpable
marks
of
the
assassination
being
completely
bespattered
with
blood
that
has
dried
upon
its
surface
and
which
can
never
be
removed
a
few
words
as
regard
the
disposition
and
habits
of
lincoln
she
is
no
longer
the
sprightly
body
she
was
when
her
very
presence
illumed
the
white
house
with
gayety
now
she
is
sad
and
sedate
seeking
seclusion
and
maintaining
communication
merely
with
her
most
intimate
personal
friends
the
most
of
her
time
she
devotes
to
instructive
reading
within
the
walls
of
her
boudoir
laying
her
book
aside
spasmodically
she
places
her
hand
upon
her
forehead
as
if
ruminating
upon
something
momentous
then
her
hand
wanders
amid
her
heavy
tresses
while
she
ponders
for
but
a
few
seconds
then
by
a
sudden
start
she
approaches
her
seizes
a
pen
and
indites
a
few
hasty
lines
to
some
trusty
friend
upon
the
troubles
that
weigh
so
heavily
upon
her
speedily
it
is
sent
to
the
but
hardly
has
the
mail
departed
from
the
city
before
she
regrets
her
hasty
letter
and
would
give
much
to
recall
it
but
too
late
it
is
gone
and
probably
the
secrets
it
contains
are
not
confidentially
kept
by
the
party
to
whom
it
was
addressed
and
soon
it
furnishes
inexhaustible
material
for
people
as
some
citizens
have
expressed
themselves
desirous
of
aiding
lincoln
a
was
opened
at
the
office
of
her
agent
brady
no
broadway
this
morning
there
is
no
limitation
as
to
the
amount
which
may
be
given
though
there
was
a
proposition
that
a
dollar
should
be
contributed
by
each
person
who
came
forward
to
inspect
the
goods
had
each
person
who
handled
these
articles
given
this
sum
a
handsome
amount
would
already
have
been
realized
the
colored
people
are
moving
in
this
matter
they
intend
to
take
up
collections
in
their
churches
for
the
benefit
of
lincoln
they
are
enthusiastic
and
a
trifle
from
every
african
in
this
city
would
in
the
aggregate
swell
into
an
immense
sum
which
would
be
doubly
acceptable
to
lincoln
it
would
satisfy
her
that
the
black
people
still
have
the
memory
of
her
deceased
husband
fresh
in
their
minds
the
goods
still
remain
exposed
to
sale
but
it
is
now
announced
that
they
will
be
sold
at
public
auction
on
the
of
this
month
unless
they
be
disposed
of
before
that
at
private
sale
it
is
stated
in
the
article
that
the
colored
people
are
moving
in
this
matter
the
colored
people
were
surprised
to
hear
of
poverty
and
the
news
of
her
distress
called
forth
strong
sympathy
from
their
warm
generous
hearts
rev
garnet
of
new
york
city
and
frederick
douglass
of
rochester
proposed
to
lecture
in
behalf
of
the
widow
of
the
lamented
president
and
schemes
were
on
foot
to
raise
a
large
sum
of
money
by
contribution
the
colored
people
recognized
abraham
lincoln
as
their
great
friend
and
they
were
anxious
to
show
their
kind
interest
in
the
welfare
of
his
family
in
some
way
more
earnest
and
substantial
than
simple
words
i
wrote
lincoln
what
we
proposed
to
do
and
she
promptly
replied
declining
to
receive
aid
from
the
colored
people
i
showed
her
letter
to
garnet
and
douglass
and
the
whole
project
was
at
once
abandoned
she
afterwards
consented
to
receive
contributions
from
my
people
but
as
the
services
of
douglass
garnet
and
others
had
been
refused
when
first
offered
they
declined
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
scheme
so
nothing
was
ever
done
the
following
letters
were
written
before
lincoln
declined
to
receive
aid
from
the
colored
people
bleecker
new
york
october
brady
esq
i
have
just
received
your
favor
together
with
the
circulars
i
will
do
all
that
lies
in
my
power
but
i
fear
that
will
not
be
as
much
as
you
anticipate
i
think
however
that
a
contribution
from
the
colored
people
of
new
york
will
be
worth
something
in
a
moral
point
of
view
and
likely
that
will
be
the
most
that
will
be
accomplished
in
the
undertaking
i
am
thoroughly
with
you
in
the
work
although
but
little
may
be
done
i
am
truly
yours
henry
highland
garnet
i
think
it
would
be
well
if
you
would
drop
a
line
to
frederick
douglass
at
rochester
new
york
rochester
my
dear
keckley
you
judge
me
rightly
i
am
willing
to
do
what
i
can
to
place
the
widow
of
our
martyr
president
in
the
affluent
position
which
her
relation
to
that
good
man
and
to
the
country
entitles
her
to
but
i
doubt
the
wisdom
of
getting
up
a
series
of
lectures
for
that
purpose
that
is
just
the
last
thing
that
should
be
done
still
if
the
thing
is
done
it
should
be
done
on
a
grand
scale
the
best
speakers
in
the
country
should
be
secured
for
the
purpose
you
should
not
place
me
at
the
head
nor
at
the
foot
of
the
list
but
sandwich
me
between
for
thus
out
of
the
way
it
would
not
give
to
the
idea
i
am
to
speak
in
newark
on
wednesday
evening
next
and
will
endeavor
to
see
you
on
the
subject
of
course
if
it
would
not
be
too
much
to
ask
i
would
gladly
see
lincoln
if
this
could
be
done
in
a
quiet
way
without
the
reporters
getting
hold
of
it
and
using
it
in
some
way
to
the
prejudice
of
that
already
much
abused
lady
as
i
shall
see
you
soon
there
is
less
reason
to
write
you
at
length
i
am
dear
madam
with
high
respect
very
truly
yours
frederick
douglass
pottsville
my
dear
keckley
you
know
the
drift
of
my
views
concerning
the
subscription
for
lincoln
yet
i
wish
to
place
them
more
distinctly
before
you
so
that
if
you
have
occasion
to
refer
to
me
in
connection
with
the
matter
you
can
do
so
with
accuracy
and
certainty
it
is
due
lincoln
that
she
should
be
indemnified
as
far
as
money
can
do
so
for
the
loss
of
her
beloved
husband
honor
gratitude
and
a
manly
sympathy
all
say
yes
to
this
i
am
willing
to
go
farther
than
this
and
say
that
lincoln
herself
should
be
the
judge
of
the
amount
which
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
believing
that
she
would
not
transcend
reasonable
limits
the
obligation
resting
on
the
nation
at
large
is
great
and
increasing
but
especially
does
it
become
colored
men
to
recognize
that
obligation
it
was
the
hand
of
abraham
lincoln
that
broke
the
fetters
of
our
enslaved
people
and
let
them
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
when
he
was
slain
our
great
benefactor
fell
and
left
his
wife
and
children
to
the
care
of
those
for
whom
he
gave
up
all
shame
on
the
man
or
woman
who
under
such
circumstances
would
grudge
a
few
paltry
dollars
to
smooth
the
pathway
of
such
a
widow
all
this
and
more
i
feel
and
believe
but
such
is
the
condition
of
this
question
owing
to
party
feeling
and
personal
animosities
now
mixed
up
with
it
that
we
are
compelled
to
consider
these
in
the
effort
we
are
making
to
obtain
subscriptions
now
about
the
meeting
in
cooper
institute
i
hold
that
that
meeting
should
only
be
held
in
concert
with
other
movements
it
is
bad
generalship
to
put
into
the
field
only
a
fraction
of
your
army
when
you
have
no
means
to
prevent
their
being
cut
to
pieces
it
is
gallant
to
go
forth
but
is
it
wise
i
want
to
see
something
more
than
the
spiteful
behind
me
when
i
step
forward
in
this
cause
at
the
cooper
institute
let
brady
out
with
his
circulars
with
his
list
of
commanding
names
let
the
and
give
a
united
blast
upon
their
bugles
let
the
city
be
placarded
and
the
doors
of
cooper
institute
be
flung
wide
open
and
the
people
without
regard
to
party
come
up
to
the
discharge
of
this
national
duty
do
let
the
cause
be
made
ridiculous
by
failure
at
the
outset
garnet
and
i
could
bear
any
mortification
of
this
kind
but
the
cause
could
not
and
our
cause
must
not
be
damaged
by
any
such
generalship
which
would
place
us
in
the
van
unsupported
i
shall
be
at
home
by
saturday
please
write
me
and
let
me
know
how
matters
are
proceeding
show
this
letter
to
brady
and
garnet
i
am
dear
madam
very
truly
yours
frederick
douglass
rochester
my
dear
keckley
it
is
just
possible
that
i
may
not
take
new
york
in
my
route
homeward
in
that
case
please
write
me
directly
at
rochester
and
let
me
know
fully
how
the
subscription
business
is
proceeding
the
meeting
here
last
night
was
a
grand
success
i
speak
again
this
evening
and
perhaps
at
reading
tomorrow
evening
my
kind
regards
to
all
who
think
of
me
at
including
lawrence
very
truly
yours
fredk
douglass
rochester
my
dear
keckley
i
very
easily
read
your
handwriting
with
practice
you
will
not
only
write
legibly
but
elegantly
so
no
more
apologies
for
writing
penmanship
has
always
been
one
of
my
own
deficiencies
and
i
know
how
to
sympathize
with
you
i
am
just
home
and
find
your
letter
awaiting
me
you
should
have
received
an
earlier
answer
but
for
this
absence
i
am
sorry
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
to
see
you
before
i
go
to
washington
i
am
leaving
home
this
week
for
ohio
and
shall
go
from
ohio
to
washington
i
shall
be
in
new
york
a
day
or
two
after
my
visit
to
washington
and
will
see
you
there
any
public
demonstration
in
which
it
will
be
desirable
for
me
to
take
part
ought
to
come
off
the
last
of
this
month
or
the
first
of
next
i
thank
you
sincerely
for
the
note
containing
a
published
letter
of
dear
lincoln
both
letters
do
credit
to
the
excellent
lady
i
prize
her
beautiful
letter
to
me
very
highly
it
is
the
letter
of
a
refined
and
spirited
lady
let
the
world
say
what
it
will
of
her
i
would
write
her
a
word
of
acknowledgment
but
for
fear
to
burden
her
with
correspondence
i
am
glad
that
garnet
and
yourself
saw
greeley
and
that
he
takes
the
right
view
of
the
matter
but
we
want
more
than
right
views
and
delay
is
death
to
the
movement
what
you
now
want
is
action
and
cooperation
if
brady
does
not
for
any
reason
find
himself
able
to
move
the
machinery
somebody
else
should
be
found
to
take
his
place
he
made
a
good
impression
on
me
when
i
saw
him
but
i
have
not
seen
the
promised
simultaneous
movement
of
which
we
spoke
when
together
this
whole
thing
should
be
in
the
hands
of
some
recognized
solid
man
in
new
york
no
man
would
be
better
than
greeley
no
man
in
the
state
is
more
laughed
at
and
yet
no
man
is
more
respected
and
trusted
a
dollar
placed
in
his
hands
would
be
as
safe
for
the
purpose
as
in
a
safe
and
what
is
better
still
everybody
believes
this
this
testimonial
must
be
more
than
a
negro
testimonial
it
is
a
great
national
duty
lincoln
did
everything
for
the
black
man
but
he
did
it
not
for
the
black
man
sake
but
for
the
nation
sake
his
life
was
given
for
the
nation
but
for
being
president
lincoln
would
have
been
alive
and
lincoln
would
have
been
a
wife
and
not
a
widow
as
now
do
all
you
can
dear
keckley
nobody
can
do
more
than
you
in
removing
the
mountains
of
prejudice
towards
that
good
lady
and
opening
the
way
of
success
in
the
plan
i
am
dear
madam
very
truly
yours
frederick
douglass
many
persons
called
at
broadway
to
examine
lincoln
wardrobe
but
as
curiosity
prompted
each
visit
but
few
articles
were
sold
brady
keyes
were
not
very
energetic
and
as
will
be
seen
by
the
letters
of
lincoln
published
in
the
appendix
that
lady
ultimately
lost
all
confidence
in
them
it
was
proposed
to
send
circulars
stating
lincoln
wants
and
appealing
to
the
generosity
of
the
people
for
aid
over
the
country
but
the
scheme
failed
brady
keyes
were
unable
to
obtain
the
names
of
prominent
men
whom
the
people
had
confidence
in
for
the
circular
to
give
character
and
responsibility
to
the
movement
so
the
whole
thing
was
abandoned
with
the
rev
garnet
i
called
on
greeley
at
the
office
of
the
in
connection
with
this
scheme
greeley
received
us
kindly
and
listened
patiently
to
our
proposals
then
said
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
rendering
you
what
assistance
i
can
but
the
movement
must
be
engineered
by
responsible
parties
brady
keyes
are
not
the
men
to
be
at
the
head
of
it
nobody
knows
who
they
are
or
what
they
are
place
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
those
that
the
people
know
and
have
some
confidence
in
and
then
there
will
be
a
chance
for
success
we
thanked
greeley
for
his
advice
for
we
believed
it
to
be
good
advice
and
bowed
ourselves
out
of
his
room
when
brady
keyes
were
informed
of
the
result
of
our
interview
they
became
very
much
excited
and
denounced
greeley
as
an
old
fool
this
put
an
end
to
the
circular
movement
the
enterprise
was
nipped
in
the
bud
and
with
the
bud
withered
lincoln
last
hope
for
success
a
portion
of
the
wardrobe
was
then
taken
to
providence
to
be
exhibited
but
without
her
consent
brady
remarked
that
the
exhibition
would
bring
in
money
and
as
money
must
be
raised
this
was
the
last
resort
he
was
of
the
impression
that
lincoln
would
approve
of
any
movement
so
it
ended
in
success
this
at
least
is
a
charitable
view
to
take
of
the
subject
had
the
exhibition
succeeded
in
providence
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
agents
of
brady
keyes
would
now
be
travelling
over
the
country
exposing
lincoln
wardrobe
to
the
view
of
the
curious
at
so
much
per
head
as
is
well
known
the
city
authorities
refused
to
allow
the
exhibition
to
take
place
in
providence
therefore
brady
returned
to
new
york
with
the
goods
and
the
travelling
show
scheme
like
the
circular
scheme
was
abandoned
weeks
lengthened
into
months
and
at
lincoln
urgent
request
i
remained
in
new
york
to
look
after
her
interests
when
she
left
the
city
i
engaged
quiet
lodgings
in
a
private
family
where
i
remained
about
two
months
when
i
moved
to
carroll
place
and
became
one
of
the
regular
boarders
of
the
house
lincoln
venture
proved
so
disastrous
that
she
was
unable
to
reward
me
for
my
services
and
i
was
compelled
to
take
in
sewing
to
pay
for
my
daily
bread
my
new
york
expedition
has
made
me
richer
in
experience
but
poorer
in
purse
during
the
entire
winter
i
have
worked
early
and
late
and
practised
the
closest
economy
lincoln
business
demanded
much
of
my
time
and
it
was
a
constant
source
of
trouble
to
me
when
left
for
the
west
i
expected
to
be
able
to
return
to
washington
in
one
week
from
the
day
but
unforeseen
difficulties
arose
and
i
have
been
detained
in
the
city
for
several
months
as
i
am
writing
the
concluding
pages
of
this
book
i
have
succeeded
in
closing
up
lincoln
imprudent
business
arrangement
at
broadway
the
firm
of
brady
keyes
is
dissolved
and
keyes
has
adjusted
the
account
the
story
is
told
in
a
few
words
on
the
of
march
i
received
the

the

lincoln
sent
me
a
check
for
this
amount
i
handed
this
check
to
keyes
and
he
gave
me
the
following
receipt

hundred

twenty

keyes
i
packed
the
articles
invoiced
and
expressed
the
trunks
to
lincoln
at
chicago
i
then
demanded
and
received
a
receipt
worded
as
follows
received

lincoln
eight
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
in
full
of
all
demands
of
every
kind
up
to
date
c
keyes
this
closed
up
the
business
and
with
it
i
close
the
imperfect
story
of
my
somewhat
romantic
life
i
have
experienced
many
ups
and
downs
but
still
am
stout
of
heart
the
labor
of
a
lifetime
has
brought
me
nothing
in
a
pecuniary
way
i
have
worked
hard
but
fortune
fickle
dame
has
not
smiled
upon
me
if
poverty
did
not
weigh
me
down
as
it
does
i
would
not
now
be
toiling
by
day
with
my
needle
and
writing
by
night
in
the
plain
little
room
on
the
fourth
floor
of
no
carroll
place
and
yet
i
have
learned
to
love
the
room
here
with
amelia
lancaster
as
my
only
companion
i
have
spent
many
pleasant
hours
as
well
as
sad
ones
and
every
chair
looks
like
an
old
friend
in
memory
i
have
travelled
through
the
shadows
and
the
sunshine
of
the
past
and
the
bare
walls
are
associated
with
the
visions
that
have
come
to
me
from
the
as
i
love
the
children
of
memory
so
i
love
every
article
in
this
room
for
each
has
become
a
part
of
memory
itself
though
poor
in
worldly
goods
i
am
rich
in
friendships
and
friends
are
a
recompense
for
all
the
woes
of
the
darkest
pages
of
life
for
sweet
sake
i
can
bear
more
burdens
than
i
have
borne
the
letters
appended
from
lincoln
to
myself

a
flood
of
light
upon

chicago
sunday
morning
my
dear
lizzie
i
am
writing
this
morning
with
a
broken
heart
after
a
sleepless
night
of
great
mental
suffering
came
up
last
evening
like
a
maniac
and
almost
threatening
his
life
looking
like
death
because
the
letters
of
the
were
published
in
yesterday
paper
i
could
not
refrain
from
weeping
when
i
saw
him
so
miserable
but
yet
my
dear
good
lizzie
was
it
not
to
protect
myself
and
help
others
and
was
not
my
motive
and
action
of
the
purest
kind
pray
for
me
that
this
cup
of
affliction
may
pass
from
me
or
be
sanctified
to
me
i
weep
whilst
i
am
writing
i
pray
for
death
this
morning
only
my
darling
taddie
prevents
my
taking
my
life
i
shall
have
to
endure
a
round
of
newspaper
abuse
from
the
republicans
because
i
dared
venture
to
relieve
a
few
of
my
wants
tell
brady
and
keyes
not
to
have
a
line
of
mine
once
more
in
print
i
am
nearly
losing
my
reason
your
friend
chicago
my
dear
lizzie
bowed
down
with
suffering
and
anguish
again
i
write
you
as
we
might
have
expected
the
republicans
are
falsifying
me
and
doing
as
they
did
when
they
prevented
the
congressional
appropriation
knows
something
about
these
same
people
as
her
husband
is
they
dare
not
utter
all
they
would
desire
to
speak
you
know
yourself
how
innocently
i
have
acted
and
from
the
best
and
purest
motives
they
will
on
to
prevent
my
disposing
of
my
things
what
a
set
they
are
the
here
white
paper
wrote
a
very
beautiful
editorial
yesterday
in
my
behalf
yet
knowing
that
i
have
been
deprived
of
my
rights
by
the
party
i
suppose
i
would
be
if
i
ventured
out
what
a
world
of
anguish
this
is
and
how
i
have
been
made
to
suffer
you
would
not
recognize
me
now
the
glass
shows
me
a
pale
wretched
haggard
face
and
my
dresses
are
like
bags
on
me
and
all
because
i
was
doing
what
i
felt
to
be
my
duty
our
minister
swazey
called
on
me
yesterday
and
said
i
had
done
perfectly
right
f
says
every
one
speaks
in
the
same
way
the
politicians
knowing
they
have
deprived
me
of
my
just
rights
would
prefer
to
see
me
starve
rather
than
dispose
of
my
things
they
will
prevent
the
sale
of
anything
so
i
have
telegraphed
for
them
i
hope
you
have
received
from
the
letters
i
have
consigned
to
his
care
see
to
this
show
none
of
them
write
me
every
day
chicago
wednesday
october
my
dear
lizzie
it
appears
as
if
the
fiends
had
let
loose
for
the
republican
papers
are
tearing
me
to
pieces
in
this
border
ruffian
west
if
i
had
committed
murder
in
every
city
in
this
union
i
could
not
be
more
traduced
and
you
know
how
innocent
i
have
been
of
the
intention
of
doing
wrong
a
piece
in
the
morning
signed
pretending
to
be
a
lady
says
there
is
no
doubt
deranged
has
been
for
years
past
and
will
end
her
life
in
a
lunatic
asylum
they
would
doubtless
like
me
to
begin
it
a
very
kind
sympathizing
minister
has
been
with
me
this
morning
and
has
now
gone
to
see
medill
of
the
to
know
if
sanctioned
his
paper
publishing
such
an
article
pray
for
me
dear
lizzie
for
i
am
very
miserable
and
since
writing
this
i
have
just
received
a
letter
from
keyes
begging
and
pleading
with
me
to
allow
them
to
use
my
name
for
donations
i
think
i
will
consent
truly
yours
chicago
sunday
my
dear
lizzie
i
am
greatly
disappointed
having
only
received
one
letter
from
you
since
we
parted
which
was
dated
the
day
after
day
after
day
i
sent
to
for
letters
after
your
promise
of
writing
to
me
every
other
day
i
can
scarcely
understand
it
i
hope
will
bring
me
a
letter
from
you
how
much
i
miss
you
can
not
be
expressed
i
hope
you
have
arrived
safely
in
washington
and
will
tell
me
everything
was
there
ever
such
cruel
newspaper
abuse
lavished
upon
an
unoffending
woman
as
has
been
showered
upon
my
devoted
head
the
people
of
this
ungrateful
country
are
like
the
in
the
manger
will
neither
do
anything
themselves
nor
allow
me
to
improve
my
own
condition
what
a
government
we
have
all
their
abuse
lavished
upon
me
only
lowers
themselves
in
the
estimation
of
all
people
the
springfield
had
an
editorial
a
few
days
since
with
the
important
information
that
lincoln
had
been
known
to
be
for
years
and
should
be
for
all
her
i
should
have
been
if
i
had
allowed
to
take
possession
of
the
white
house
in
the
comfortable
stealings
by
contracts
from
the
government
these
low
creatures
are
allowed
to
hurl
their
malicious
wrath
at
me
with
no
one
to
defend
me
or
protect
me
if
i
should
starve
these
people
injure
themselves
far
more
than
they
could
do
me
by
their
lies
and
villany
their
aim
is
to
prevent
my
goods
being
sold
or
anything
being
done
for
me
i
very
much
fear
they
have
succeeded
write
me
my
dear
friend
your
candid
opinion
about
everything
i
wished
to
be
made
better
off
quite
as
much
to
improve
your
condition
as
well
as
for
myself
two
weeks
ago
dear
lizzie
we
were
in
that
of
discomfort
and
dirt
we
are
far
asunder
every
other
day
for
the
past
week
i
have
had
a
chill
brought
on
by
excitement
and
suffering
of
mind
in
the
midst
of
it
i
have
moved
into
my
winter
quarters
and
am
now
very
comfortably
situated
my
parlor
and
bedroom
are
very
sweetly
furnished
i
am
lodged
in
a
handsome
house
a
very
kind
good
family
and
their
meals
are
excellent
i
consider
myself
fortunate
in
all
this
i
feel
assured
that
the
republicans
who
to
cover
up
their
own
perfidy
and
neglect
have
used
every
villanous
falsehood
in
their
power
to
injure
me
i
fear
they
have
than
succeeded
but
if
their
day
of
reckoning
does
not
come
in
this
world
it
in
the
next
i
have
determined
to
shed
no
more
tears
over
all
their
cruel
falsehoods
yet
just
now
i
feel
almost
forsaken
by
god
and
man
except
by
the
to
be
vilified
write
me
all
that
keyes
and
brady
think
of
the
result
for
myself
after
abuse
i
nothing
oh
that
i
could
see
you
write
me
dear
lizzie
if
only
a
line
i
can
not
understand
your
silence
hereafter

your
letters
to
lincoln
west
washington

affectionate
friend
postscript
to
letter
of
i
can
not
send
this
letter
off
without
writing
you
two
little
incidents
that
have
occurred
within
the
past
week
we
may
call
it
rendered
for
to
say
the
least
there
is
a
paper
published
in
chicago
called
the
owned
and
published
by
springfield
men
each
morning
since
my
return
it
has
been
thrown
at
my
door
filled
with
abuse
of
myself
four
days
ago
a
piece
appeared
in
it
asking
right
had
to
diamonds
and
laces
yesterday
morning
an
article
appeared
in
the
same
paper
announcing
that
the
day
previous
at
the
house
of
bunn
the
owner
of
the
paper
in
springfield
illinois
the
house
had
been
entered
at
in
the
morning
by
burglars
and
had
been
robbed
of
diamond
rings
and
a
quantity
of
fine
laces
this
morning
paper
announces
the
recovery
of
these
articles
bunn
who
made
his
hundreds
of
thousands
off
our
government
is
running
this
paper
and
denouncing
the
wife
of
the
man
from
whom
he
obtained
his
means
i
enclose
you
the
article
about
the
recovery
of
the
goods
a
few
years
ago
he
had
a
in
s
these
facts
can
be
authenticated
another
case
in
point
the
evening
i
left
my
house
to
come
here
the
young
daughter
of
one
of
my
neighbors
in
the
same
block
was
in
a
house
not
a
square
off
and
in
a
childish
manner
was
regretting
that
i
could
not
retain
my
house
the
man
in
the
house
said
waste
your
tears
and
regrets
on
mrs
lincoln
an
hour
afterward
the
husband
and
wife
went
out
to
make
a
call
doubtless
to
gossip
about
me
on
their
return
they
found
their
young
boy
had
almost
blinded
himself
with
gunpowder
who
will
say
that
the
cry
of
the
and
fatherless
is
disregarded
in
sight
if
man
is
not
merciful
god
will
be
in
his
own
time
chicago
october
my
dear
lizzie
i
received
a
very
pleasant
note
from
douglass
on
yesterday
i
will
reply
to
it
this
morning
and
enclose
it
to
you
to
hand
or
send
him
immediately
in
this
morning
there
was
a
little
article
designed
to
make
capital
me
just
now
that
of
my
brothers
were
in
the
southern
army
during
the
war
if
they
had
been
friendly
with
me
they
might
have
said
they
were
brothers
of
whom
she
had
not
known
since
they
were
infants
and
as
she
left
kentucky
at
an
early
age
her
sympathies
were
entirely
republican
that
her
feelings
were
entirely
with
the
north
during
the
war
and
always
i
never
failed
to
urge
my
husband
to
be
an
republican
and
now
in
the
day
of
my
trouble
you
see
how
very
party
is
trying
to
work
against
me
tell
douglass
and
every
one
how
deeply
my
feelings
were
enlisted
in
the
cause
of
freedom
why
upon
these
brothers
whom
i
never
knew
since
they
were
infants
and
scarcely
then
for
my
early
home
was
truly
at
a
school
write
to
him
all
this
and
talk
it
to
every
one
else
if
we
succeed
i
will
soon
send
you
enough
for
a
very
large
supply
of
trimming
material
for
the
winter
truly
chicago
my
dear
lizzie
your
letter
of
last
wednesday
is
received
and
i
can
not
refrain
from
expressing
my
surprise
that
before
now
and
did
not
go
out
in
of
names
and
have
sent
forth
all
those
circulars
their
conduct
is
becoming
mysterious
we
have
heard
enough
of
it
is
time
now
they
should
be
their
delay
i
fear
has
ruined
the
business
the
circulars
should
all
have
been
out
before
the
i
can
not
understand
their
slowness
as
greeley
home
is
in
new
york
he
could
certainly
have
been
found
had
he
and
there
are
plenty
of
other
good
men
in
new
york
as
well
as
himself
i
venture
to
say
that
the
election
not
a
circular
will
be
sent
out
i
begin
to
think
they
are
making
a
political
business
of
and
not
for
benefit
either
their
delay
in
acting
is
becoming
very
suspicious
their
slow
bad
management
is
every
prospect
of
success
i
fear
you
are
only
losing
your
time
in
new
york
and
that
i
shall
be
left
for
what
i
am
owing
the
firm
i
have
written
to
and
and
they
do
nothing
that
i
request
i
want
neither
douglass
nor
garnet
to
lecture
in
my
behalf
the
conduct
in
new
york
is
disgusting
me
with
the
whole
business
i
can
not
understand
what
they
have
been
about
their
delay
has
only
given
the
enemies
time
to
strength
what
does
it
all
mean
of
course
give
the
lady
at
permission
to
sell
the
dresses
cheaper
i
am
feeling
wretchedly
over
the
slowness
and
style
of
b
i
believe
in
my
heart
i
am
being
used
as
a
tool
for
party
purposes
and
they
do
not
design
sending
out
a
circular
your
friend
chicago
my
dear
lizzie
did
you
receive
a
letter
a
few
days
since
with
one
enclosed
for
douglass
also
a
printed
letter
of
mine
which
i
wished
him
to
read
do
write
me
every
other
day
at
least
i
am
so
and
and
lizzie
dear
i
fear
we
have
not
the
chance
of
success
remain
in
new
york
a
little
longer
and
occupy
yourself
with
the
sewing
of
your
friends
i
shall
be
able
to
learn
about
my
business
in
you
know
there
will
be
no
success
do
you
not
candidly
express
yourself
to
me
write
me
if
only
a
few
lines
and
that
very
frequently
called
up
on
yesterday
with
judge
davis
goes
with
judge
on
tuesday
to
settle
the
estate
which
will
give
us
each
about
with
the
income
i
told
you
of
a
year
for
each
of
us
you
made
a
mistake
about
my
house
costing
it
was
the
congress
gave
me
i
spent
for
house
and
furniture
which
owing
to
the
smallness
of
my
income
i
was
obliged
to
leave
i
mention
about
the
division
of
the
estate
to
you
dear
lizzie
because
when
it
is
done
the
will
harp
upon
it
you
can
explain
everything
in
new
york
please
do
so
to
every
one
please
see
if
it
should
come
out
in
the
papers
i
had
hoped
if
something
was
gained
to
have
immediately
placed
in
more
pleasant
circumstances
do
urge
to
add
his
name
to
the
circular
also
get
them
to
have
beecher
there
must
not
be
an
hour
delay
in
this
is
very
spiteful
at
present
and
i
think
hurries
up
the
division
to
my
purposes
he
mentioned
yesterday
that
he
was
going
to
the
rocky
mountains
so
soon
as
edgar
welles
joined
him
he
is
very
write
me
when
you
receive
this
your
silence
pains
me
truly
yours
chicago
my
dear
lizzie
i
closed
and
sent
off
my
letter
before
i
had
finished
all
i
had
to
say
do
not
hint
to
or
or
any
one
else
my
doubts
of
them
watch
as
to
so
many
falsehoods
are
told
in
the
papers
that
all
the
stuff
about
his
wife
and
himself
may
be
untrue
i
hope
it
may
prove
so
i
received
a
letter
from
keyes
this
morning
i
believe
i
wrote
you
that
i
had
how
hard
it
is
that
i
can
not
see
and
talk
with
you
in
this
time
of
great
trouble
i
feel
as
if
i
had
not
a
friend
in
the
world
save
yourself
i
sometimes
wish
myself
out
of
this
world
of
sorrow
and
care
i
fear
my
fine
articles
at
b
are
getting
pulled
to
pieces
and
soiled
i
do
not
wish
you
to
leave
without
having

finest

up
and
returned
to
me
the
white
camel
hair
shawl

the

wish

chicago
my
dear
keckley
your
last
letter
has
been
received
and
believe
me
i
duly
appreciate
your
great
interest
in
my
affairs
i
hope
the
day
arrive
when
i
can
return
your
kindness
in
than
words
as
you
are
aware
of
my
beloved
husband
great
indulgence
to
me
in
pecuniary
matters
thereby
allowing
me
to
indulge
in
bestowing
favors
on
those
whom
i
considered
worthy
of
it
it
is
in
this
respect
i
feel
chiefly
the
humiliation
of
my
small
circumscribed
income
if
congress
or
the
nation
had
given
me
the
four
years
salary
i
should
have
been
able
to
live
as
the
widow
of
the
great
president
lincoln
should
with
sufficient
means
to
give
liberally
to
all
benevolent
objects
and
at
my
death
should
have
left
at
least
half
of
it
to
the
freedmen
for
the
liberty
of
whom
his
precious
sacred
life
was
sacrificed
the
men
who
prevented
being
done
by
their
villanous
unscrupulous
falsehoods
are
no
friends
of
the
colored
race
and
as
you
well
know
have
led
johnson
on
in
his
wicked
course
is
and
the
day
of
retribution
will
come
to
all
such
if
not
in
this
world
in
the
great
hereafter
to
which
those
sinners
are
so
rapidly
hastening
with
an
innocent
conscience
i
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
raise
my
weak
woman
voice
against
the
persecutions
that
have
assailed
me
emanating
from
the
tongues
of
such
men
as
weed
co
i
have
felt
that
their
infamous
false
lives
was
a
sufficient
vindication
of
my
character
they
have
never
forgiven
me
for
standing
between
my
pure
and
noble
husband
and
themselves
when
for
their
own
vile
purposes
they
would
have
led
him
into
error
the
country
knows
and
why
should
i
dwell
longer
on
it
in
the
blissful
home
where
my
worshipped
husband
dwells
god
is
ever
merciful
and
it
is
the
consolation
of
my
broken
heart
that
my
darling
husband
is
ever
retaining
the
devoted
love
which
he
always
so
abundantly
manifested
for
his
wife
and
children
in
this
life
i
feel
assured
his
watchful
loving
eyes
are
always
watching
over
us
and
he
is
fully
aware
of
the
wrong
and
injustice
permitted
his
family
by
a
country
he
lost
his
life
in
protecting
i
write
earnestly
because
i
feel
very
deeply
it
appears
to
me
a
very
remarkable
coincidence
that
most
of
the
good
feeling
regarding
my
straitened
circumstances
proceeds
from
the
colored
people
in
whose
cause
my
noble
husband
was
so
largely
interested
whether
we
are
successful
or
not
douglass
and
garnet
will
always
have
my
most
grateful
thanks
they
are
very
noble
men
if
any
results
should
crown
their
efforts
you
may
well
believe
at
my
death
whatever
sum
it
may
be
will
be
bequeathed
to
the
colored
people
who
are
very
near
my
heart
in
yesterday
paper
it
was
announced
that
gov
andrew
family
were
having
contributed
to
them
gov
was
a
good
man
but
what
did
do
compared
to
president
lincoln
right
and
left
the
latter
gave
when
he
had
but
little
to
bestow
and
in
consequence
his
family
are
now
feeling
it
yet
for
my
life
i
would
not
recall
a
dollar
he
ever
gave
yet
his
favorite
expression
when
i
have
playfully
alluded
to
the
day
that
might
be
in
store
for
and
his
on
several
occasions
he
has
looked
at
me
so
earnestly
and
replied
your
bread
upon
the
waters
although
the
petty
sum
of
was
an
insufficient
return
for
congress
to
make
me
and
allowanced
to
its
meagreness
by
men
who
traduced
and
vilified
the
loved
wife
of
the
great
man
who
and
from
whom
they
amassed
great
fortunes
for
and
seward
and
did
this
last
and
yet
was
permitted
by
an
american
people
who
owed
remaining
a
nation
to
my
husband
i
have
dwelt
too
long
on
this
painful
subject
but
when
i
have
been
compelled
from
a
pitiful
income
to
make
a
of
my
home
as
i
now
am
doing
think
you
that
it
does
not
rankle
in
my
heart
fortunately
with
my
husband
great
great
love
for
me
the
knowledge
of
this
future
for
his
petted
and
idolized
wife
was
spared
him
and
yet
i
feel
in
my
heart
knows
it
all
sumner
the
intimate
friend
of
better
days
called
to
see
me
two
or
three
weeks
since
he
who
had
been
an
habitué
of
the
white
house
both
the
rooms
of
the
president
and
my
own
in
either
place
he
was
always
sure
of
a
heartfelt
welcome
my
present
situation
must
have
struck
a
painful
chord
in
his
noble
sympathizing
heart
and
yet
when
i
endeavored
to
ameliorate
my
condition
the
cry
has
been
so
fearful
against
me
as
to
cause
me
to
forget
my
own
identity
and
suppose
i
had
plundered
the
nation
indeed
and
committed
murder
this
certainly
can
not
be
america
land
of
the
the
of
the
the
evening
before
last
call
i
had
received
douglass
letter
i
mentioned
the
circumstance
to
sumner
who
replied
frederick
douglass
is
a
very
noble
talented
man
and
i
know
of
no
one
who
writes
a
more
beautiful
letter
i
am
sending
you
a
long
letter
lizzie
but
i
rely
a
great
deal
on
your
indulgence
my
fear
is
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
decipher
the
scrawl
written
so
hastily
i
remain
truly
yours
mary
lincoln
chicago
my
dear
lizzie
by
the
time
you
receive
this
note
you
will
doubtless
find
the
papers
over
the
large
income
which
we
are
each
to
have
knowing
exactly
the
amount
we
each
will
have
which
i
have
already
informed
you
i
was
going
to
say
i
have
been
shocked
at
the
sum
set
down
to
each
but
i
have
learned
not
to
be
surprised
at
anything
of
course
it
is
gotten
up
to
defeat
success
will
see
the
necessity
for
those
circulars
being
issued
weeks
since
i
enclose
you
a
scrap
from
yesterday
of
marked
no
also
no
the
sum
of
has
been
subtracted
in
hours
from
the
same
paper
if
it
continues
for
a
few
days
longer
it
will
soon
be
right
it
is
a
secesh
paper
says
congress
gave
me
as
a
besides
of
remaining
salary
the
know
to
be
utterly
false
you
can
show
this
note
to
b
also
the
scraps
sent
let
no
one
see
them
but
themselves
and
then
burn
them
it
is
all
just
as
i
expected
that
when
the
division
took
place
a
would
be
made
of
a
and
i
fear
it
will
succeed
in
injuring
the
premeditated
plans
if
the
the
might
simply
say
that
the
sum
assigned
each
was
false
that
was
the
sum
the
administrator
judge
davis
filed
his
bonds
for
but
by
all
means
must
not
be
given
and
then
the
can
descant

enclosed
with
this
to

do
not
let
them
retain
it
an
instant
after
reading

the

articles
i
knew
these
falsehoods
would
be
circulated
when
the
estate
was
divided
what
been
the
cause
of
the
delay
about
the
circulars
i
fear
between
ourselves
we
have
reason
to
distrust
those
men
whatever
is
raised
by
the
colored
people
i
solemnly
give
my
word
at
my
death
it
shall
every
cent
be
returned
to
them
and
out
of
the
sum
if
it
is
shall
have
at
my
death
and
i
can
not
live
long
suffering
as
i
am
now
doing
if
is
raised
by
your
people
you
shall
have
the
sum
at
my
death
and
in
either
event
the
raised
or
i
will
give
you
a
year
and
the
promised
sum
at
my
death
it
will
make
your
life
easier
i
have
more
faith
in
and
efforts
than
in
b
i
assure
you
this
division
has
been
trumped
up
just
now
through
spite
i
have
written
to
judge
davis
for
an
exact
statement
which
i
will
send
to
you
when
received

have
great
confidence
in

things

out
of
the
way
the
and
money
comes
in
i
will
not
care

the
hour

this
i
hope
they
will
send
out
circulars
urge
to
do
this
your
friend
saturday
morning
november
my
dear
lizzie
although
i
am
suffering
with
a
fearful
headache
yet
as
your
note
of
wednesday
is
received
i
must
write
i
am
grieved
to
find
that
you
are
so
wretchedly
on
wednesday
the
of
november
sent
me
the
telegram
i
send
you
if
he
is
not
in
earnest
what
does
it
mean
what
is
the
rate
of
expenses
that
has
gone
to
in
my
business
that
he
dares
to
withhold
my
immense
amount
of
goods
do
you
believe
they
sending
out
those
circulars
of
course
you
will
be
well
rewarded
if
we
have
any
success
but
as
to
i
have
it
not
for
myself
or
any
one
else
pray
what
does
propose
to
charge
for
i
pray
god
there
will
be
some
success
although
dear
lizzie
entirely
between
ourselves
i
fear
i
am
in
villanous
hands
as
to
money
i
have
it
for
myself
just
now
even
if
nothing
comes
in
when
i
get
my
things
back
if
ever
from
i
will
send
you
some
of
those
dresses
to
dispose
of
at
washington
for
your
own
benefit
if
we
get
something
you
will
find
that
and
performance
for
life
will
be
it
is
why
b
never
writes
and
perhaps
in
three
weeks
all
this
is
very
strange
chicago
sunday
my
dear
lizzie
i
wrote
you
on
yesterday
and
am
aware
it
was
not
a
pleasant
letter
although
i
wrote
what
i
fear
will
turn
out
to
be
it
will
be
two
weeks
since
the
legally
attested
consent
from
me
was
received
by
and
and
yet
have
not
been
obtained
for
it
when
last
heard
from
however
we
will
soon
see
for
ourselves
if
you
and
i
are
honest
in
our
motives
and
intentions
it
is
no
reason
the
world
is
so
if
i
should
gain
nothing
pecuniarily
by
the
loud
cry
that
has
been
made
over
my
affairs
it
has
been
a
losing
game
indeed
and
the
laugh
of
the
world
will
be
against
me
if
it
turns
out
as
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
it
will
be
failure
if
they
had
issued
those
circulars
when
they
should
have
done
before
the
election
then
it
would
have
been
all
right
alas
alas
what
a
mistake
it
has
all
been
i
have
thought
seriously
over
the
whole
business
and
know
what
i
am
about
i
am
grateful
for
the
sympathy
of
douglass
and
garnet
i
see
that
is
advertised
to
lecture
in
chicago
some
time
this
winter
tell
him
for
me
he
must
call
and
see
me
give
him
my
number
if
i
had
been
able
to
retain
a
house
i
should
have
offered
him
apartments
when
he
came
to
as
it
is
i
have
to
content
with
lodgings
an
ungrateful
country
this
i
very
much
fear
the
malignity
of
seward
weed
and
will
operate
in
congress
the
coming
winter
and
that
i
will
be
denounced
with
their
infamous
and
villanous
falsehoods
the
father
of
wickedness
and
lies
will
get
those
men
when
they
away
and
such
fiends
as
they
are
always
linger
in
this
mortal
sphere
the
agitation
of
mind
has
very
much
impaired
my
health
why
why
was
not
i
taken
when
my
darling
husband
was
called
from
my
side
i
have
been
allowed
no
rest
by
those
who
in
my
desolation
should
have
protected
me
how
dearly
i
should
love
to
see
you
very
sad
never
dear
lizzie
think
of
my
great
nervousness
the
night
before
we
parted
i
had
been
so
harassed
with
my
fears
always
yours
december
my
dear

your
letters
just
received
i
have
just
written
to
to
withdraw
the
go
to
him
yourself
the
moment
you
receive

the
idea
of
congress
doing
anything
is
ridiculous
how
much
could

others

you
receive

a
few
lines
on
yesterday
i
have
twice
written
to

have

see
him

believe
any
more
newspaper
attacks
would
me
as
has
passed
away
from
me
with
my
husband
my
slightest
act
is
misinterpreted
makes
all

eyeing

do
send

your

announcing
that
my
clothes

were
to
be
paraded
in

those

gave

has
almost
turned
me
wild
would
go

such
a

was
done
if
you
have
the
for

pray
write
to

how
little

you

may

heaven
turn
your

would
blast

carried

remember
in

unmitigated
anguish
and
have
those
clothes
worn
on
those
fearful
occasions
recalled
i
am
positively
dying
with
a
broken
heart

the

that
i
shall
be
living

a
short

may
we
all
meet
in
a
better
world
where
is
unknown

six

would
not
pay
your
expenses
and
pay
you
as
you
made

the
probability

that

need
more

careless

it
comes
