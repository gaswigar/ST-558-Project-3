but
was
my

unto
those

she
was
my
lord
and
only
isabel
was
all
the
daughters
that
this

had
whom
afterward
your

took
to

from

fragrant
garden
of

womb
your
gracious
self
the
flower
of

hope
derived
is
inheritor
to
france
but
note
the
rancor
of
rebellious
minds
when
thus
the
lineage
of
le
bew
was
out
the
french
obscured
your
mother
privilege
and
though
she
were
the
next
of
blood
proclaimed
john
of
the
house
of
valois
now
their
king
the
reason
was
they
say
the
realm
of
france
replete
with
princes
of
great
parentage
ought
not
admit
a
governor
to
rule
except
he
be
descended
of
the
male
and
that
the
special
ground
of
their
contempt
wherewith
they
study
to
exclude
your
grace
but
they
shall
find
that
forged
ground
of
theirs
to
be
but
dusty
heaps
of
brittle
sand
perhaps
it
will
be
thought
a
heinous
thing
that
i
a
french
man
should
discover
this
but
heaven
i
call
to
record
of
my
vows
it
is
not
hate
nor
any
private
wrong
but
love
unto
my
country
and
the
right
provokes
my
tongue
thus
lavish
in
report
you
are
the
lineal
watchman
of
our
peace
and
john
of
valois
indirectly
climbs
what
then
should
subjects
but
embrace
their
king
ah
where
in
may
our
duty
more
be
seen
than
striving
to
rebate
a
tyrant
pride
and
place
the
true
shepherd
of
our
commonwealth
king
edward
this
counsel
artois
like
to
fruitful
showers
hath
added
growth
unto
my
dignity
and
by
the
fiery
vigor
of
thy
words
hot
courage
is
engendered
in
my
breast
which
heretofore
was
raked
in
ignorance
but
now
doth
mount
with
golden
wings
of
fame
and
will
approve
fair
isabel

yoke
their
stubborn

having

entreats

lords
that
we
may
hear
the

exeunt
lords
king
takes
his

wherefore
art
thou
come
lorrain
the
most
renowned
prince
king
john
of
france
doth
greet
thee
edward
and
by
me
commands
that
for
so
much
as
by
his
liberal
gift
the
guyen
dukedom
is
entailed
to
thee
thou
do
him
lowly
homage
for
the
same
and
for
that
purpose
here
i
summon
thee
repair
to
france
within
these
forty
days
that
there
according
as
the
custom
is
thou
mayst
be
sworn
true
liegeman
to
our
king
or
else
thy
title
in
that
province
dies
and
he
him
self
will
repossess
the
place
king
edward
see
how
occasion
laughs
me
in
the
face
no
sooner
minded
to
prepare
for
france
but
straight
i
am
invited
nay
with
threats
upon
a
penalty
enjoined
to
come
twere
but
a
childish
part
to
say
him
lorrain
return
this
answer
to
thy
lord
i
mean
to
visit
him
as
he
requests
but
how
not
servilely
disposed
to
bend
but
like
a
conqueror
to
make
him
bow
his
lame
unpolished
shifts
are
come
to
light
and
truth
hath
pulled
the
vizard
from
his
face
that
set
a
gloss
upon
his
arrogance
dare
he
command
a
fealty
in
me
tell
him
the
crown
that
he
usurps
is
mine
and
where
he
sets
his
foot
he
ought
to
kneel
tis
not
a
petty
dukedom
that
i
claim
but
all
the
whole
dominions
of
the
realm
which
if
with
grudging
he
refuse
to
yield
i
take
away
those
borrowed
plumes
of
his
and
send
him
naked
to
the
wilderness
lorrain
then
edward
here
in
spite
of
all
thy
lords
i
do
pronounce
defiance
to
thy
face
prince
edward
defiance
french
man
we
rebound
it
back
even
to
the
bottom
of
thy
master
throat
and
be
it
spoke
with
reverence
of
the
king
my
gracious
father
and
these
other
lords
i
hold
thy
message
but
as
scurrilous
and
him
that
sent
thee
like
the
lazy
drone
crept
up
by
stealth
unto
the
eagle
nest
from
whence
we
shake
him
with
so
rough
a
storm
as
others
shall
be
warned
by
his
harm
warwick
bid
him
leave
of
the
lyons
case
he
wears
least
meeting
with
the
lyon
in
the
field
he
chance
to
tear
him
piecemeal
for
his
pride
artois
the
soundest
counsel
i
can
give
his
grace
is
to
surrender
ere
he
be
constrained
a
voluntary
mischief
hath
less
scorn
than
when
reproach
with
violence
is
borne
lorrain
degenerate
traitor
viper
to
the
place
where
thou
was
fostered
in
thine
infancy
bearest
thou
a
part
in
this
conspiracy
he
draws
his
sword
king
edward
lorrain
behold
the
sharpness
of
this
steel
drawing
his
fervent
desire
that
sits
against
my
heart
is
far
more
thorny
pricking
than
this
blade
that
with
the
nightingale
i
shall
be
scared
as
oft
as
i
dispose
my
self
to
rest
until
my
colours
be
displayed
in
france
this
is
my
final
answer
so
be
gone
lorrain
it
is
not
that
nor
any
english
brave
afflicts
me
so
as
doth
his
poisoned
view
that
is
most
false
should
most
of
all
be
true
exeunt
lorrain
and
train
king
edward
now

our
fleeting

lodowick
i
might
perceive
his

in

lost
his

her

changing

like
inconstant
clouds
that
rack
upon

carriage
of

winds
increase
and
die
in
his
disturbed
cheeks
lo
when
she
blushed
even
then
did
he
look
pale
as
if
her
cheeks
by
some
enchanted
power
attracted
had
the
cherry
blood
from
his
anon
with
reverent
fear
when
she
grew
pale
his
cheeks
put
on
their
scarlet
ornaments
but
no
more
like
her
oriental
red
than
brick
to
coral
or
live
things
to

why
did
he
then
thus
counterfeit
her
looks
if
she
did
blush
twas
tender
modest
shame
being
in
the
sacred
presence
of
a
king
if
he
did
blush
twas
red
immodest
shame
to
veil
his
eyes

being
a

if
she
looked
pale
twas
silly
woman
fear
to
bear
her
self
in
presence
of
a
king
if
he
looked
pale
it
was
with
guilty
fear
to
dote
amiss
being
a
mighty

then
scottish

farewell
i

lingering
english

his
highness
walking
all
alone
enter
king
edward
king
edward
she
is
grown
more
fairer
far
since
i
came
hither
her
voice
more
silver
every
word
than
other
her
wit
more
fluent
what
a
strange
discourse
unfolded
she
of
david
and
his
scots
thus
quoth
she
spake
and
then
spoke
broad
with
epithites
and
accents
of
the
scot
but
somewhat
better
than
the
scot
could
speak
thus
quoth
she
and
answered
then
her
self
for
who
could
speak
like
her
but
she
her
self
breathes
from
the
wall
an
angel
note
from
heaven
of
sweet
defiance
to
her
barbarous
foes
when
she
would
talk
of
peace
me
thinks
her
tongue
commanded
war
to
prison
when
of
war
it
wakened
caesar
from
his
roman
grave
to
hear
war
beautified
by
her
discourse
wisdom
is
foolishness
but
in
her
tongue
beauty
a
slander
but
in
her
fair
face
there
is
no
summer
but
in
her
cheerful
looks
nor
frosty
winter
but
in
her
disdain
i
can
not
blame
the
scots
that
did
besiege
her
for
she
is
all
the
treasure
of
our
land
but
call
them
cowards
that
they
ran
away
having
so
rich
and
fair
a
cause
to
art
thou
there
lodowick
give
me
ink
and
paper
lodowick
i
will
my
liege
king
edward
and
bid
the
lords
hold
on
their
play
at
chess
for
we
will
walk
and
meditate
alone
lodowick
i
will
my
sovereign
exit
lodowick
king
edward
this
fellow
is
well
read
in
poetry
and
hath
a
lusty
and
persuasive
spirit
i
will
acquaint
him
with
my
passion
which
he
shall
shadow
with
a
veil
of
lawn
through
which
the
queen
of
beauties
queen
shall
see
her
self
the
ground
of
my
infirmity
enter
lodowick
king
edward
hast
thou
pen
ink
and
paper
ready
lodowick
lodowick
ready
my
liege
king
edward
then
in
the
summer
arbor
sit
by
me
make
it
our
counsel
house
or
cabinet
since
green
our
thoughts
green
be
the
conventicle
where
we
will
ease
us
by
disburdening
them
now
lodowick
invocate
some
golden
muse
to
bring
thee
hither
an
enchanted
pen
that
may
for
sighs
set
down
true
sighs
indeed
talking
of
grief
to
make
thee
ready
groan
and
when
thou
writest
of
tears
encouch
the
word
before
and
after
with
such
sweet
laments
that
it
may
raise
drops
in
a
tartar
eye
and
make
a
flintheart
scythian
pitiful
for
so
much
moving
hath
a
poet
pen
then
if
thou
be
a
poet
move
thou
so
and
be
enriched
by
thy
sovereign
love
for
if
the
touch
of
sweet
concordant
strings
could
force
attendance
in
the
ears
of
hell
how
much
more
shall
the
strains
of
poets
wit
beguile
and
ravish
soft
and
humane
minds
lodowick
to
whom
my
lord
shall
i
direct
my
stile
king
edward
to
one
that
shames
the
fair
and
sots
the
wise
whose
bod
is
an
abstract
or
a
brief
contains
each
general
virtue
in
the
world
better
than
beautiful
thou
must
begin
devise
for
fair
a
fairer
word
than
fair
and
every
ornament
that
thou
wouldest
praise
fly
it
a
pitch
above
the
soar
of
praise
for
flattery
fear
thou
not
to
be
convicted
for
were
thy
admiration
ten
times
more
ten
times
ten
thousand
more
the
worth
exceeds
of
that
thou
art
to
praise
thy
praises
worth
begin
i
will
to
contemplate
the
while
forget
not
to
set
down
how
passionate
how
heart
sick
and
how
full
of
languishment
her
beauty
makes
me
lodowick
write
i
to
a
woman
king
edward
what
beauty
else
could
triumph
over
me
or
who
but
women
do
our
love
lays
greet
what
thinkest
thou
i
did
bid
thee
praise
a
horse
lodowick
of
what
condition
or
estate
she
is
twere
requisite
that
i
should
know
my
lord
king
edward
of
such
estate
that
hers
is
as
a
throne
and
my
estate
the
footstool
where
she
treads
then
maist
thou
judge
what
her
condition
is
by
the
proportion
of
her
mightiness
write
on
while
i
peruse
her
in
my
her
voice
to
music
or
the
nightingale
to
music
every
summer
leaping
swain
compares
his
sunburnt
lover
when
she
speaks
and
why
should
i
speak
of
the
nightingale
the
nightingale
sings
of
adulterate
wrong
and
that
compared
is
too
satyrical
for
sin
though
sin
would
not
be
so
esteemed
but
rather
virtue
sin
sin
virtue
deemed
her
hair
far
softer
than
the
silk
worm
twist
like
to
a
flattering
glass
doth
make
more
fair
the
yellow
amber
like
a
flattering
glass
comes
in
too
soon
for
writing
of
her
eyes
i
say
that
like
a
glass
they
catch
the
sun
and
thence
the
hot
reflection
doth
rebound
against
the
breast
and
burns
my
heart
within
ah
what
a
world
of
descant
makes
my
soul
upon
this
voluntary
ground
of
love
come
lodowick
hast
thou
turned
thy
ink
to
gold
if
not
write
but
in
letters
capital
my
mistress
name
and
it
will
gild
thy
paper
read
lord
read
fill
thou
the
empty
hollows
of
mine
ears
with
the
sweet
hearing
of
thy
poetry
lodowick
i
have
not
to
a
period
brought
her
praise
king
edward
her
praise
is
as
my
love
both
infinite
which
apprehend
such
violent
extremes
that
they
disdain
an
ending
period
her
beauty
hath
no
match
but
my
affection
hers
more
than
most
mine
most
and
more
than
more
hers
more
to
praise
than
tell
the
sea
by
drops
nay
more
than
drop
the
massy
earth
by
sands
and
sand
by
sand
print
them
in
memory
then
wherefore
talkest
thou
of
a
period
to
that
which
craves
unended
admiration
read
let
us
hear
lodowick
fair
and
chaste
than
is
the
queen
of
shades
king
edward
that
line
hath
two
faults
gross
and
palpable
comparest
thou
her
to
the
pale
queen
of
night
who
being
set
in
dark
seems
therefore
light
what
is
she
when
the
sun
lifts
up
his
head
but
like
a
fading
taper
dim
and
dead
my
love
shall
brave
the
eye
of
heaven
at
noon
and
being
unmasked
outshine
the
golden
sun
lodowick
what
is
the
other
fault
my
sovereign
lord
king
edward
read
the
line
again
lodowick
fair
and
chaste
king
edward
i
did
not
bid
thee
talk
of
chastity
to
ransack
so
the
treasure
of
her
mind
for
i
had
rather
have
her
chased
than
chaste
out
with
the
moon
line
i
will
none
of
it
and
let
me
have
her
likened
to
the
sun
say
she
hath
thrice
more
splendour
than
the
sun
that
her
perfections
emulate
the
sun
that
she
breeds
sweets
as
plenteous
as
the
sun
that
she
doth
thaw
cold
winter
like
the
sun
that
she
doth
cheer
fresh
summer
like
the
sun
the
she
doth
dazzle
gazers
like
the
sun
and
in
this
application
to
the
sun
bid
her
be
free
and
general
as
the
sun
who
smiles
upon
the
basest
weed
that
grows
as
lovingly
as
on
the
fragrant
rose
let
see
what
follows
that
same
moonlight
line
lodowick
fair
and
chaste
than
is
the
queen
of
shades
more
bold
in
constance
king
edward
in
constance
than
who
lodowick
judith
was
king
edward
o
monstrous
line
put
in
the
next
a
sword
and
i
shall
woo
her
to
cut
of
my
head
blot
blot
good
lodowick
let
us
hear
the
next
lodowick
there
all
that
yet
is
done
king
edward
i
thank
thee
then
thou
hast
done
little
ill
but
what
is
done
is
passing
passing
no
let
the
captain
talk
of
boisterous
war
the
prisoner
of
emured
dark
constraint
the
sick
man
best
sets
down
the
pangs
of
death
the
man
that
starves
the
sweetness
of
a
feast
the
frozen
soul
the
benefit
of
fire
and
every
grief
his
happy
opposite
love
can
not
sound
well
but
in
lover
tongues
give
me
the
pen
and
paper
i
will
write
enter
countess
but
soft
here
comes
the
treasurer
of
my
lodowick
thou
knowst
not
how
to
draw
a
battle
these
wings
these
flankers
and
these
squadrons
argue
in
thee
defective
discipline
thou
shouldest
have
placed
this
here
this
other
here
countess
pardon
my
boldness
my
thrice
gracious
lords

my
intrusion
here

duty

melancholy
king
edward
ah

discontent

liege

my
woman

pawn
it
self
to
buy
thy
remedy

edward
if
thou
speakst
true
then
have
i
my
redress

thy
power
to
redeem
my
joys
and
i
am
joyful

die
countess
i
will
my
liege
king
edward
swear
countess
that
thou
wilt
countess
by
heaven
i
will
king
edward
then
take
thy
self
a
little
way
a
side
and
tell
thy
self
a
king
doth
dote
on
thee
say
that
within
thy
power
it
doth
lie
to
make
him
happy
and
that
thou
hast
sworn
to
give
him
all
the
joy
within
thy
power
do
this
and
tell
me
when
i
shall
be
happy

proof
thereof

times

thy
beauty
that

would
enjoy
countess
o
were

and
dispossess
my
self
to
give

is
soldered
to
my
life
take
one
and
both
for
like
an
humble
shadow
it
haunts
the
sunshine
of
my
summer
life
king
edward
but
thou
maist
lend
it
me
to
sport
with
all
countess
as
easy
may
my
intellectual
soul
be
lent
away
and

my
soul

and

my
soul

abbey
and
she
an
angel
pure
divine
unspotted
if
i
should
leave
her
house
my
lord
to
thee
i
kill
my
poor
soul
and
my
poor
soul
me
king
edward
didst
thou
not
swear
to
give
me
what
i
would
countess
i
did
my
liege
so
what
you
would
i
could
king
edward
i
wish
no
more
of
thee
than
thou
maist
give
nor
beg
i
do
not
but
i
rather
buy
that
is
thy
love
and
for
that
love
of
thine
in
rich
exchange
i
tender
to
thee
mine
countess
but
that
your
lips
were
sacred
my
lord
you
would
profane
the
holy
name
of
love
that
love
you
offer
me
you
can
not
give
for
caesar
owes
that
tribute
to
his
queen
that
love
you
beg
of
me
i
can
not
give
for
sara
owes
that
duty
to
her
lord
he
that
doth
clip
or
counterfeit
your
stamp
shall
die
my
lord
and
will
your
sacred
self
commit
high
treason
against
the
king
of
heaven
to
stamp
his
image
in
forbidden
metal
forgetting
your
allegiance
and
your
oath
in
violating
marriage
sacred
law
you
break
a
greater
honor
than
your
self
to
be
a
king
is
of
a
younger
house
than
to
be
married
your
progenitour
sole
reigning
adam
on
the
universe
by
god
was
honored
for
a
married
man
but
not
by
him
anointed
for
a
king
it
is
a
penalty
to
break
your
statutes
though
not
enacted
with
your
highness
hand
how
much
more
to
infringe
the
holy
act
made
by
the
mouth
of
god
sealed
with
his
hand
i
know
my
sovereign
in
my
husband
love
who
now
doth
loyal
service
in
his
wars
doth
but
so
try
the
wife
of
salisbury
whither
she
will
hear
a
wanton
tale
or
no
lest
being
therein
guilty
by
my
stay
from
that
not
from
my
liege
i
turn
away
exit
king
edward
whether
is
her
beauty
by
her
words
dying
or
are
her
words
sweet
chaplains
to
her
beauty
like
as
the
wind
doth
beautify
a
sail
and
as
a
sail
becomes
the
unseen
wind
so
do
her
words
her
beauties
beauties
words
o
that
i
were
a
honey
gathering
bee
to
bear
the
comb
of
virtue
from
this
flower
and
not
a
poison
sucking
envious
spider
to
turn
the
juice
i
take
to
deadly
venom
religion
is
austere
and
beauty
gentle
too
strict
a
guardian
for
so
fair
a
ward
o
that
she
were
as
is
the
air
to
me
why
so
she
is
for
when
i
would
embrace
her
this
do
i
and
catch
nothing
but
my
self
i
must
enjoy
her
for
i
can
not
beat
with
reason
and
reproof
fond
love
a
way
enter
warwick
here
comes
her
father
i
will
work
with
him
to
bear
my
colours
in
this
field
of
love
warwick
how
is
it
that
my
sovereign
is
so
sad
may
i
with
pardon
know
your
highness
grief
and
that
my
old
endeavor
will
remove
it
it
shall
not
cumber
long
your
majesty
king
edward
a
kind
and
voluntary
gift
thou
proferest
that
i
was
forward
to
have
begged
of
thee
but
o
thou
world
great
nurse
of
flattery
why
dost
thou
tip
men
tongues
with
golden
words
and
peise
their
deeds
with
weight
of
heavy
lead
that
fair
performance
can
not
follow
promise
o
that
a
man
might
hold
the
heart
close
book
and
choke
the
lavish
tongue
when
it
doth
utter
the
breath
of
falsehood
not
charactered
there
warwick
far
be
it
from
the
honor
of
my
age
that
i
should
owe
bright
gold
and
render
lead
age
is
a
cynic
not
a
flatterer
i
say
again
that
if
i
knew
your
grief
and
that
by
me
it
may
be
lessened
my
proper
harm
should
buy
your
highness
good
king
edward
these
are
the
vulgar
tenders
of
false
men
that
never
pay
the
duty
of
their
words
thou
wilt
not
stick
to
swear
what
thou
hast
said
but
when
thou
knowest
my
grief
condition
this
rash
disgorged
vomit
of
thy
word
thou
wilt
eat
up
again
and
leave
me
helpless
warwick
by
heaven
i
will
not
though
your
majesty
did
bid
me
run
upon
your
sword
and
die
king
edward
say
that
my
grief
is
no
way
medicinable
but
by
the
loss
and
bruising
of
thine
honour
warwick
if
nothing
but
that
loss
may
vantage
you
i
would
accompt
that
loss
my
vantage
too
king
edward
thinkst
that
thou
canst
unswear
thy
oath
again
warwick
i
can
not
nor
i
would
not
if
i
could
king
edward
but
if
thou
dost
what
shall
i
say
to
thee
warwick
what
may
be
said
to
any
perjured
villain
that
breaks
the
sacred
warrant
of
an
oath
king
edward
what
wilt
thou
say
to
one
that
breaks
an
oath
warwick
that
he
hath
broke
his
faith
with
god
and
man
and
from
them
both
stands
excommunicate
king
edward
what
office
were
it
to
suggest
a
man
to
break
a
lawful
and
religious
vow
warwick
an
office
for
the
devil
not
for
man
king
edward
that
devil
office
must
thou
do
for
me
or
break
thy
oath
or
cancel
all
the
bonds
of
love
and
duty
twixt
thy
self
and
me
and
therefore
warwick
if
thou
art
thy
self
the
lord
and
master
of
thy
word
and
oath
go
to
thy
daughter
and
in
my
behalf
command
her
woo
her
win
her
any
ways
to
be
my
mistress
and
my
secret
love
i
will
not
stand
to
hear
thee
make
reply
thy
oath
break
hers
or
let
thy
sovereign
die
exit
warwick
o
doting
king
o
detestable
office
well
may
i
tempt
my
self
to
wrong
my
self
when
he
hath
sworn
me
by
the
name
of
god
to
break
a
vow
made
by
the
name
of
god
what
if
i
swear
by
this
right
hand
of
mine
to
cut
this
right
hand
off
the
better
way
were
to
profane
the
idol
than
confound
it
but
neither
will
i
do
i
keep
mine
oath
and
to
my
daughter
make
a
recantation
of
all
the
virtue
i
have
preacht
to
her
i
say
she
must
forget
her
husband
salisbury
if
she
remember
to
embrace
the
king
i
say
an
oath
may
easily
be
broken
but
not
so
easily
pardoned
being
broken
i
say
it
is
true
charity
to
love
but
not
true
love
to
be
so
charitable
i
say
his
greatness
may
bear
out
the
shame
but
not
his
kingdom
can
buy
out
the
sin
i
say
it
is
my
duty
to
persuade
but
not
her
honesty
to
give
consent
enter
countess
see
where
she
comes
was
never
father
had
against
his
child
an
embassage
so
bad
countess
my
lord
and
father
i
have
sought
for
you
my
mother
and
the
peers
importune
you
to
keep
in
presence
of
his
majesty
and
do
your
best
to
make
his
highness
merry
warwick
aside
how
shall
i
enter
in
this
graceless
arrant
i
must
not
call
her
child
for
where
the
father
that
will
in
such
a
suit
seduce
his
child
then
of
salisbury
shall
i
so
begin
no
he
my
friend
and
where
is
found
the
friend
that
will
do
friendship
such
indammagement
to
the
countess
neither
my
daughter
nor
my
dear
friend
wife
i
am
not
warwick
as
thou
thinkst
i
am
but
an
attorney
from
the
court
of
hell
that
thus
have
housed
my
spirit
in
his
form
to
do
a
message
to
thee
from
the
king
the
mighty
king
of
england
dotes
on
thee
he
that
hath
power
to
take
away
thy
life
hath
power
to
take
thy
honor
then
consent
to
pawn
thine
honor
rather
than
thy
life
honor
is
often
lost
and
got
again
but
life
once
gone
hath
no
recovery
the
sun
that
withers
hay
doth
nourish
grass
the
king
that
would
disdain
thee
will
advance
thee
the
poets
write
that
great
achilles
spear
could
heal
the
wound
it
made
the
moral
is
what
mighty
men
misdo
they
can
amend
the
lyon
doth
become
his
bloody
jaws
and
grace
his
forragement
by
being
mild
when
vassel
fear
lies
trembling
at
his
feet
the
king
will
in
his
glory
hide
thy
shame
and
those
that
gaze
on
him
to
find
out
thee
will
lose
their
looking
in
the
sun
what
can
one
drop
of
poison
harm
the
sea
whose
huge
vastures
can
digest
the
ill
and
make
it
loose
his
operation
the
king
great
name
will
temper
thy
misdeeds
and
give
the
bitter
potion
of
reproach
a
sugared
sweet
and
most
delicious
taste
besides
it
is
no
harm
to
do
the
thing
which
without
shame
could
not
be
left
undone
thus
have
i
in
his
majesty
behalf
appareled
sin
in
virtuous
sentences
and
dwell
upon
thy
answer
in
his
suit
countess
unnatural
besiege
woe
me
unhappy
to
have
escaped
the
danger
of
my
foes
and
to
be
ten
times
worse
injured
by
friends
hath
he
no
means
to
stain
my
honest
blood
but
to
corrupt
the
author
of
my
blood
to
be
his
scandalous
and
vile
solicitor
no
marvel
though
the
branches
be
then
infected
when
poison
hath
encompassed
the
root
no
marvel
though
the
leprous
infant
die
when
the
stern
dame
invenometh
the
dug
why
then
give
sin
a
passport
to
offend
and
youth
the
dangerous
reign
of
liberty
blot
out
the
strict
forbidding
of
the
law
and
cancel
every
cannon
that
prescribes
a
shame
for
shame
or
penance
for
offence
no
let
me
die
if
his
too
boistrous
will
will
have
it
so
before
i
will
consent
to
be
an
actor
in
his
graceless
lust
warwick
why
now
thou
speakst
as
i
would
have
thee
speak
and
mark
how
i
unsay
my
words
again
an
honorable
grave
is
more
esteemed
than
the
polluted
closet
of
a
king
the
greater
man
the
greater
is
the
thing
be
it
good
or
bad
that
he
shall
undertake
an
unreputed
mote
flying
in
the
sun
presents
a
greater
substance
than
it
is
the
freshest
summer
day
doth
soonest
taint
the
loathed
carrion
that
it
seems
to
kiss
deep
are
the
blows
made
with
a
mighty
axe
that
sin
doth
ten
times
aggravate
it
self
that
is
committed
in
a
holy
place
an
evil
deed
done
by
authority
is
sin
and
subornation
deck
an
ape
in
tissue
and
the
beauty
of
the
robe
adds
but
the
greater
scorn
unto
the
beast
a
spatious
field
of
reasons
could
i
urge
between
his
glory
daughter
and
thy
shame
that
poison
shews
worst
in
a
golden
cup
dark
night
seems
darker
by
the
lightning
flash
lilies
that
fester
smell
far
worse
than
weeds
and
every
glory
that
inclines
to
sin
the
shame
is
treble
by
the
opposite
so
leave
i
with
my
blessing
in
thy
bosom
which
then
convert
to
a
most
heavy
curse
when
thou
convertest
from
honor
golden
name
to
the
black
faction
of
bed
blotting
shame

follow
thee

when
my
mind

alas
she
wins
the

my

our

give

like
fiery
dragons
took

likewise
meeting
from

smoky
wombs
sent
many
grim
ambassadors
of
death
then
gan
the

to
turn
to
gloomy
night

darkness

as
well
enclose
the
quick
as
those
that
were
but
newly
reft
of
life
no
leisure
served
for
friends
to
bid
farewell
and
if
it
had
the
hideous
noise
was
such
as
each
to

seemed
deaf
and
dumb
purple
the
sea
whose
channel
filled
as
fast
with
streaming
gore
that
from
the
maimed
fell
as
did
her
gushing
moisture
break
into
the
crannied
cleftures
of
the
through
shot
planks
here
flew
a
head
dissevered
from
the
trunk
there
mangled
arms
and
legs
were
tossed
aloft
as
when
a
whirl
wind
takes
the
summer
dust
and
scatters
it
in
middle
of
the
air
then
might
ye
see
the
reeling
vessels
split
and
tottering
sink
into
the
ruthless
flood
until
their
lofty
tops
were
seen
no
more
all
shifts
were
tried
both
for
defence
and
hurt

now
the
effect
of
valor

of
force
of
resolution
and
of
cowardice
we
lively
pictures
how
the

for

the

by

laid
about

did
the

of

a

never
yet
spread

all
in

both

revolted

welcome

since

arrival
on
the
coast
of
france
prince
edward
successfully
i
thank
the
gracious
heavens
some
of
their
strongest
cities
we
have
won
as
harflew
lo
crotay
and
carentigne
and
others
wasted
leaving
at
our
heels
a
wide
apparent
field
and
beaten
path
for
solitariness
to
progress
in
yet
those
that
would
submit
we
kindly
pardoned
but
who
in
scorn
refused
our
proffered
peace
endured
the
penalty
of
sharp
revenge
king
edward
ah
france
why
shouldest
thou
be
thus
obstinate
against
the
kind
embracement
of
thy
friends
how
gently
had
we
thought
to
touch
thy
breast
and
set
our
foot
upon
thy
tender
mould
but
that
in
froward
and
disdainful
pride
thou
like
a
skittish
and
untamed
colt
dost
start
aside
and
strike
us
with
thy
heels
but
tell
me
ned
in
all
thy
warlike
course
hast
thou
not
seen
the
usurping
king
of
france
prince
edward
yes
my
good
lord
and
not
two
hours
ago
with
full
a
hundred
thousand
fighting
men
upon
the
one
side
of
the
river
bank
and
on
the
other
both
his
multitudes
i
feared
he
would
have
cropped
our
smaller
power
but
happily
perceiving
your
approach
he
hath
with
drawn
himself
to
cressey
plains
where
as
it
seemeth
by
his
good
array
he
means
to
bid
us
battle
presently
king
edward
he
shall
be
welcome
that
the
thing
we
crave
enter
king
john
dukes
of
normandy
and
lorrain
king
of
boheme
young
phillip
and
soldiers
king
john
edward
know
that
john
the
true
king
of
france
musing
thou
shouldst
encroach
upon
his
land
and
in
thy
tyranous
proceeding
slay
his
faithful
subjects
and
subvert
his
towns
spits
in
thy
face
and
in
this
manner
following
obraids
thee
with
thine
arrogant
intrusion
first
i
condemn
thee
for
a
fugitive
a
thievish
pirate
and
a
needy
mate
one
that
hath
either
no
abiding
place
or
else
inhabiting
some
barren
soil
where
neither
herb
or
fruitful
grain
is
had
doest
altogether
live
by
pilfering
next
insomuch
thou
hast
infringed
thy
faith
broke
leage
and
solemn
covenant
made
with
me
i
hold
thee
for
a
false
pernicious
wretch
and
last
of
all
although
i
scorn
to
cope
with
one
so
much
inferior
to
my
self
yet
in
respect
thy
thirst
is
all
for
gold
thy
labour
rather
to
be
feared
than
loved
to
satisfy
thy
lust
in
either
part
here
am
i
come
and
with
me
have
i
brought
exceeding
store
of
treasure
pearl
and
coin
leave
therefore
now
to
persecute
the
weak
and
armed
entering
conflict
with
the
armed
let
it
be
seen
mongest
other
petty
thefts
how
thou
canst
win
this
pillage
manfully
king
edward
if
gall
or
wormwood
have
a
pleasant
taste
then
is
thy
salutation
honey
sweet
but
as
the
one
hath
no
such
property
so
is
the
other
most
satirical
yet
wot
how
i
regard
thy
worthless
taunts
if
thou
have
uttered
them
to
foil
my
fame
or
dim
the
reputation
of
my
birth
know
that
thy
wolvish
barking
can
not
hurt
if
slyly
to
insinuate
with
the
world
and
with
a
strumpet
artificial
line
to
paint
thy
vicious
and
deformed
cause
be
well
assured
the
counterfeit
will
fade
and
in
the
end
thy
foul
defects
be
seen
but
if
thou
didst
it
to
provoke
me
on
as
who
should
say
i
were
but
timorous
or
coldly
negligent
did
need
a
spur
bethink
thy
self
how
slack
i
was
at
sea
how
since
my
landing
i
have
won
no
towns
entered
no
further
but
upon
the
coast
and
there
have
ever
since
securely
slept
but
if
i
have
been
other
wise
employed
imagine
valois
whether
i
intend
to
skirmish
not
for
pillage
but
for
the
crown
which
thou
dost
wear
and
that
i
vow
to
have
or
one
of
us
shall
fall
into
his
grave
prince
edward
look
not
for
cross
invectives
at
our
hands
or
railing
execrations
of
despite
let
creeping
serpents
hid
in
hollow
banks
sting
with
their
tongues
we
have
remorseless
swords
and
they
shall
plead
for
us
and
our
affairs
yet
thus
much
briefly
by
my
father
leave
as
all
the
immodest
poison
of
thy
throat
is
scandalous
and
most
notorious
lies
and
our
pretended
quarrel
is
truly
just
so
end
the
battle
when
we
meet
to
day
may
either
of
us
prosper
and
prevail
or
luckless
curst
receive
eternal
shame
king
edward
that
needs
no
further
question
and
i
know
his
conscience
witnesseth
it
is
my
therefore
valois
say
wilt
thou
yet
resign
before
the
sickles
thrust
into
the
corn
or
that
inkindled
fury
turn
to
flame
king
john
edward
i
know
what
right
thou
hast
in
france
and
ere
i
basely
will
resign
my
crown
this
champion
field
shall
be
a
pool
of
blood
and
all
our
prospect
as
a
slaughter
house
prince
edward
aye
that
approves
thee
tyrant
what
thou
art
no
father
king
or
shepherd
of
thy
realm
but
one
that
tears
her
entrails
with
thy
hands
and
like
a
thirsty
tyger
suckst
her
blood
audley
you
peers
of
france
why
do
you
follow
him
that
is
so
prodigal
to
spend
your
lives
charles
whom
should
they
follow
aged
impotent
but
he
that
is
their
true
borne
sovereign
king
edward
obraidst
thou
him
because
within
his
face
time
hath
ingraved
deep
characters
of
age
know
these
grave
scholars
of
experience
like
stiff
grown
oaks
will
stand
immovable
when
whirl
wind
quickly
turns
up
younger
trees
darby
was
ever
any
of
thy
father
house
king
but
thyself
before
this
present
time
edward
great
linage
by
the
mother
side
five
hundred
years
hath
held
the
scepter
up
judge
then
conspiratours
by
this
descent
which
is
the
true
borne
sovereign
this
or
that
philip
father
range
your
battles
prate
no
more
these
english
fain
would
spend
the
time
in
words
that
night
approaching
they
might
escape
unfought
king
john
lords
and
my
loving
subjects
now
the
time
that
your
intended
force
must
bide
the
touch
therefore
my
friends
consider
this
in
brief
he
that
you
fight
for
is
your
natural
king
he
against
whom
you
fight
a
foreigner
he
that
you
fight
for
rules
in
clemency
and
reins
you
with
a
mild
and
gentle
bit
he
against
whom
you
fight
if
he
prevail
will
straight
inthrone
himself
in
tyranny
makes
slaves
of
you
and
with
a
heavy
hand
curtail
and
curb
your
sweetest
liberty
then
to
protect
your
country
and
your
king
let
but
the
haughty
courage
of
your
hearts
answer
the
number
of
your
able
hands
and
we
shall
quickly
chase
these
fugitives
for
what
this
edward
but
a
belly
god
a
tender
and
lascivious
wantoness
that
thother
day
was
almost
dead
for
love
and
what
i
pray
you
is
his
goodly
guard
such
as
but
scant
them
of
their
chines
of
beef
and
take
away
their
downy
featherbeds
and
presently
they
are
as
resty
stiff
as
twere
a
many
over
ridden
jades
then
french
men
scorn
that
such
should
be
your
lords
and
rather
bind
ye
them
in
captive
bands
all
frenchmen
vive

this

a
falcon
when

ever
after
she
be
haggard
like
let
edward
be
delivered
by
our

he
will
have
vanquished
cheerful
death

the
king
of
boheme
father
whom
i
slew
whose
thousands
had
entrenched
me
round
about
and
lay
as
thick
upon
my
battered
crest
as
on
an
anvil
with
their
ponderous
glaves
yet
marble
courage
still
did
underprop
and
when
my
weary
arms
with
often
blows
like
the
continual
laboring
axe
that
is
enjoined
to
fell
a
load
of
oaks
began
to
faulter
straight
i
would
record
my
gifts
you
gave
me
and
my
zealous
vow
and
then
new
courage
made
me
fresh
again
that
in
despite
i
carved
my
passage
forth
and
put
the
multitude
to
speedy
flight
lo
thus
hath
edward
hand
filled
your
request
and
done
i
hope
the
duty
of
a
knight

deserved

and
therefore
with
thy
sword

of

a
note

cockney
nor
his
soldiers

but
which
way
is
the
fearful
king

and
his

ned
thou
and
audley
shall
pursue
them
still
my
self
and
derby
will
to
calice
straight
and
there
be
begirt
that
haven
town
with
siege
now
lies
it
on
an
upshot
therefore
strike
and
wistly
follow
whiles
the
game
on
foot
what
picture
this
prince
edward
a
pelican
my
lord
wounding
her
bosom
with
her
crooked
beak
that
so
her
nest
of
young
ones
may
be
fed
with
drops
of
blood
that
issue
from
her
heart
the
motto
sic

so
should
you
exeunt

iv

bretagne

of
the

enter
lord
mountford
with
a
coronet
in
his
hand
with
him
the
earl
of
salisbury
mountford
my
lord
of
salisbury
since
by
your
aide
mine
enemy
sir
charles
of
blois
is
slain
and
i
again
am
quietly
possessed
in
brittain
dukedom
know
that
i
resolve
for
this
kind
furtherance
of
your
king
and
you
to
swear
allegiance
to
his
majesty
in
sign
whereof
receive
this
coronet
bear
it
unto
him
and
withal
mine
oath
never
to
be
but
edward
faithful
friend
salisbury
i
take
it
mountfort
thus
i
hope
ere
long
the
whole
dominions
of
the
realm
of
france
will
be
surrendered
to
his
conquering
hand
exit
mountford
now
if
i
knew
but
safely
how
to
pass
i
would
at
calice
gladly
meet
his
grace
whether
i
am
by
letters
certified
that
he
intends
to
have
his
host
removed
it
shall
be
so
this
policy
will
serve
ho
whose
within
bring
villiers
to
me
enter
villiers
villiers
thou
knowest
thou
art
my
prisoner
and
that
i
might
for
ransom
if
i
would
require
of
thee
a
hundred
thousand
francs
or
else
retain
and
keep
thee
captive
still
but
so
it
is
that
for
a
smaller
charge
thou
maist
be
quit
and
if
thou
wilt
thy
self
and
this
it
is
procure
me
but
a
passport
of
charles
the
duke
of
normandy
that
i
without
restraint
may
have
recourse
to
callis
through
all
the
countries
where
he
hath
to
do
which
thou
maist
easily
obtain
i
think
by
reason
i
have
often
heard
thee
say
he
and
thou
were
students
once
together
and
then
thou
shalt
be
set
at
liberty
how
saiest
thou
wilt
thou
undertake
to
do
it
villiers
i
will
my
lord
but
i
must
speak
with
him
salisbury
why
so
thou
shalt
take
horse
and
post
from
hence
only
before
thou
goest
swear
by
thy
faith
that
if
thou
canst
not
compass
my
desire
thou
wilt
return
my
prisoner
back
again
and
that
shall
be
sufficient
warrant
for
me
villiers
to
that
condition
i
agree
my
lord
and
will
unfainedly
perform
the

exit
salisbury
farewell

they
refuse

my
lord
and
will
not
ope
their
gates
and
let
us
in
we
will
intrench
our
selves
on
every
side
that
neither

may
come

this
accursed

where
our

the
promised

that
made
them
stand
aloof
is
now
retired

gone
an
other

it
will
repent
them
of
their
stubborn
will
but
what
are
these
poor
ragged
slaves
my
lord

edward
ask
what
they
are
it
seems
they
come
from

you
living

or
gliding
ghosts
crept

poor
no
ghosts

but
men

breath
a
life
far
worse
than
is
the
quiet
sleep
of
death
we
are
distressed
poor
inhabitants
that
long
have
been
diseased
sick
and
lame
and
now
because
we
are
not
fit

serve
the
captain
of
the
town
hath
thrust
us
forth
that
so
expense
of
victuals
may
be
saved
king
edward
a
charitable
deed
no

and
worthy
praise
but
how

in
such
a
case
we
can
no
less
but
put

of

villiers
charles
i
wonder
villiers
thou
shouldest
importune
me
for
one
that
is
our
deadly
enemy
villiers
not
for
his
sake
my
gracious
lord
so
much
am
i
become
an
earnest
advocate
as
that
thereby
my
ransom
will
be
quit
charles
thy
ransom
man
why
needest
thou
talk
of
that
art
thou
not
free
and
are
not
all
occasions
that
happen
for
advantage
of
our
foes
to
be
accepted
of
and
stood
upon
villiers
no
good
my
lord
except
the
same
be
just
for
profit
must
with
honor
be
comixt
or
else
our
actions
are
but
scandalous
but
letting
pass
their
intricate
objections
wilt
please
your
highness
to
subscribe
or
no
charles
villiers
i
will
not
nor
i
can
not
do
it
salisbury
shall
not
have
his
will
so
much
to
claim
a
passport
how
it
pleaseth
himself
villiers
why
then
i
know
the
extremity
my
lord
i
must
return
to
prison
whence
i
came
charles
return
i
hope
thou
wilt
not
what
bird
that
hath
escaped
the
fowler
gin
will
not
beware
how
she
ensnared
again
or
what
is
he
so
senseless
and
secure
that
having
hardly
past
a
dangerous
gul
will
put
him
self
in
peril
there
again
villiers
ah
but
it
is
mine
oath
my
gracious
lord
which
i
in
conscience
may
not
violate
or
else
a
kingdom
should
not
draw
me
hence
charles
thine
oath
why
tat
doth
bind
thee
to
abide
hast
thou
not
sworn
obedience
to
thy
prince
villiers
in
all
things
that
uprightly
he
commands
but
either
to
persuade
or
threaten
me
not
to
perform
the
covenant
of
my
word
is
lawless
and
i
need
not
to
obey
charles
why
is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
kill
and
not
to
break
a
promise
with
his
foe
villiers
to
kill
my
lord
when
war
is
once
proclaimed
so
that
our
quarrel
be
for
wrongs
received
no
doubt
is
lawfully
permitted
us
but
in
an
oath
we
must
be
well
advised
how
we
do
swear
and
when
we
once
have
sworn
not
to
infringe
it
though
we
die
therefore
therefore
my
lord
as
willing
i
return
as
if
i
were
to
fly
to
paradise
charles
stay
my
villiers
thine
honorable
min
deserves
to
be
eternally
admired
thy
suit
shall
be
no
longer
thus
deferred
give
me
the
paper
i
subscribe
to
it
and
wheretofore
i
loved
thee
as
villiers
hereafter
i
embrace
thee
as
my
self
stay
and
be
still
in
favour
with
thy
lord
villiers
i
humbly
thank
you
grace
i
must
dispatch
and
send
this
passport
first
unto
the
earl
and
then
i
will
attend
your
highness
pleasure
charles
do
so
villiers
and
charles
when
he
hath
need
be
such
his
soldiers
howsoever
he
speed
exit
villiers
enter
king
john
king
john
come
charles
and
arm
thee
edward
is
entrapped
the
prince
of
wales
is
fallen
into
our
hands
and
we
have
compassed
him
he
can
not
escape
charles
but
will
your
highness
fight
to
day
king
john
what
else
my
son
he
scarce
eight
thousand
strong
and
we
are
threescore
thousand
at
the
least
charles
i
have
a
prophecy
my
gracious
lord
wherein
is
written
what
success
is
like
to
happen
us
in
this
outrageous
war
it
was
delivered
me
at
cresses
field
by
one
that
is
an
aged
hermit
there
reads
feathered
foul
shall
make
thine
army
tremble
and
flint
stones
rise
and
break
the
battle
ray
then
think
on
him
that
doth
not
now
dissemble
for
that
shall
be
the
hapless
dreadful
day
yet
in
the
end
thy
foot
thou
shalt
advance
as
far
in
england
as
thy
foe
in
france
king
john
by
this
it
seems
we
shall
be
fortunate
for
as
it
is
impossible
that
stones
should
ever
rise
and
break
the
battle
ray
or
airy
foul
make
men
in
arms
to
quake
so
is
it
like
we
shall
not
be
subdued
or
say
this
might
be
true
yet
in
the
end
since
he
doth
promise
we
shall
drive
him
hence
and
forage
their
country
as
they
have
done
ours
by
this
revenge
that
loss
will
seem
the
less
but
all
are
frivolous
fancies
toys
and
dreams
once
we
are
sure
we
have
ensnared
the
son
catch
we
the
father
after
how
we
can
exeunt
act
iv
scene
iv
the
same
the
english
camp
enter
prince
edward
audley
and
others
prince
edward
audley
the
arms
of
death
embrace
us
round
and
comfort
have
we
none
save
that
to
die
we
pay
sower
earnest
for
a
sweeter
life
at
cressey
field
out
clouds
of
warlike
smoke
choked
up
those
french
mouths
dissevered
them
but
now
their
multitudes
of
millions
hide
masking
as
twere
the
beauteous
burning
sun
leaving
no
hope
to
us
but
sullen
dark
and
eyeless
terror
of
all
ending
night
audley
this
sudden
mighty
and
expedient
head
that
they
have
made
fair
prince
is
wonderful
before
us
in
the
valley
lies
the
king
vantaged
with
all
that
heaven
and
earth
can
yield
his
party
stronger
battled
than
our
whole
his
son
the
braving
duke
of
normandy
hath
trimmed
the
mountain
on
our
right
hand
up
in
shining
plate
that
now
the
aspiring
hill
shews
like
a
silver
quarry
or
an
orb
aloft
the
which
the
banners
bannarets
and
new
replenished
pendants
cuff
the
air
and
beat
the
winds
that
for
their
gaudiness
struggles
to
kiss
them
on
our
left
hand
lies
phillip
the
younger
issue
of
the
king
coating
the
other
hill
in
such
array
that
all
his
guilded
upright
pikes
do
seem
straight
trees
of
gold
the
pendants
leaves
and
their
device
of
antique
heraldry
quartered
in
colours
seeming
sundry
fruits
makes
it
the
orchard
of
the
hesperides
behind
us
too
the
hill
doth
bear
his
height
for
like
a
half
moon
opening
but
one
way
it
rounds
us
in
there
at
our
backs
are
lodged
the
fatal
crossbows
and
the
battle
there
is
governed
by
the
rough
chattillion
then
thus
it
stands
the
valley
for
our
flight
the
king
binds
in
the
hills
on
either
hand
are
proudly
royalized
by
his
sons
and
on
the
hill
behind
stands
certain
death
in
pay
and
service
with
chattillion
prince
edward
death
name
is
much
more
mighty
than
his
deeds
thy
parcelling
this
power
hath
made
it
more
as
many
sands
as
these
my
hands
can
hold
are
but
my
handful
of
so
many
sands
then
all
the
world
and
call
it
but
a
power
easily
up
and
quickly
thrown
away
but
if
i
stand
to
count
them
sand
by
sand
the
number
would
confound
my
memory
and
make
a
thousand
millions
of
a
task
which
briefly
is
no
more
indeed
than
one
these
quarters
squadrons
and
these
regiments
before
behind
us
and
on
either
hand
are
but
a
power
when
we
name
a
man
his
hand
his
foot
his
head
hath
several
strengths
and
being
all
but
one
self
instant
strength
why
all
this
many
audley
is
but
one
and
we
can
call
it
all
but
one
man
strength
he
that
hath
far
to
go
tells
it
by
miles
if
he
should
tell
the
steps
it
kills
his
heart
the
drops
are
infinite
that
make
a
flood
and
yet

charles
our

sleep

now
the

sun
in
all
his
pride
looked
through
his

coach
upon

hath

hover
our

heads
and
keep
in
triangles
and
cornered
squares
right
as
our
forces
are
embattled
with
their
approach
there
came
this
sudden
fog
which
now
hath
hid
the
airy
floor
of
heaven
and
made
at
noon
a
night
unnatural
upon
the
quaking
and
dismayed
world
in
brief
our
soldiers
have
let
fall
their
arms

famished
few
come

work

carrion
that
they
kill
for

laid
down

of
those
poor
english
that
are
marked
to
die
hover
about
and
if
they
cry
to
us
tis
but
for
meat
that
we
must
kill
for
them
away
and
comfort
up
my
soldiers

you
let

thou

i
can

which
of

twain
is
greater
infamy
to
disobey
thy

or
thy
self
thy
word
nor
no
mans
may
exceed
his
power
nor
that
same
man
doth
never
break
his
word
that
keeps
it
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
the
breach
of
faith

which
if
thy
self
without
consent
do
break
thou
art
not
charged
with
the

of
faith
go
hang
him
for
thy
license
lies
in
me
and
my
constraint
stands
the
excuse
for
thee
charles
what
am
i
not
a

in

adieu
and

i
shall
be

i
may
not

upon

who
comes

copland
and
king
david

copland
my
lord
and
david
king
of
scots
king
edward
is
this
the
proud
presumptuous
esquire
of
the
north
that
would
not
yield
his
prisoner
to
my
queen
copland
i
am
my
liege
a
northern
esquire
indeed
but
neither
proud
nor
insolent
i
trust
king
edward
what
moved
thee
then
to
be
so
obstinate
to
contradict
our
royal
queen
desire
copland
no
wilful
disobedience
mighty
lord
but
my
desert
and
public
law
at
arms
i
took
the
king
my
self
in
single
fight
and
like
a
soldiers
would
be
loath
to
lose
the
least
that
i
had
won
and
copland
straight
upon
your
highness
charge
is
come
to
france
and
with
a
lowly
mind
doth
vale
the
bonnet
of
his
victory
receive
dread
lord
the
custom
of
my
fraught
the
wealthy
tribute
of
my
laboring
hands
which
should
long
since
have
been
surrendered
up
had
but
your
gracious
self
been
there
in
place
queen
phillip
but
copland
thou
didst
scorn
the
king
command
neglecting
our
commission
in
his
name
copland
his
name
i
reverence
but
his
person
more
his
name
shall
keep
me
in
allegiance
still
but
to
his
person
i
will
bend
my
knee
king
edward
i
pray
thee
phillip
let
displeasure
pass
this
man
doth
please
me
and
i
like
his
words
for
what
is
he
that
will
attempt
great
deeds
and
lose
the
glory
that
ensues
the
same
all
rivers
have
recourse
unto
the
sea
and
copland
faith
relation
to
his
king
kneel
therefore
down
now

knight
and
to
maintain
thy
state
i
freely
give
five
hundred
marks
a
year
to
thee
and
thine
enter
salisbury
welcome
lord
salisbury
what
news
from
brittain
salisbury
this
mighty
king
the
country
we
have
won
and
john
de
mountford
regent
of
that
place
presents
your
highness
with
this
coronet
protesting
true
allegiance
to
your
grace
king
edward
we
thank
thee
for
thy
service
valiant
earl
challenge
our
favour
for
we
owe
it
thee
salisbury
but
now
my
lord
as
this
is
joyful
news
so
must
my
voice
be
tragical
again
and
i
must
sing
of
doleful
accidents
king
edward
what
have
our
men
the
overthrow
at
poitiers
or
is
our
son
beset
with
too
much
odds
salisbury
he
was
my
lord
and
as
my
worthless
self
with
forty
other
serviceable
knights
under
safe
conduct
of
the
dauphin
seal
did
travail
that
way
finding
him
distressed
a
troop
of
lances
met
us
on
the
way
surprised
and
brought
us
prisoners
to
the
king
who
proud
of
this
and
eager
of
revenge
commanded
straight
to
cut
off
all
our
heads
and
surely
we
had
died
but
that
the
duke
more
full
of
honor
than
his
angry
sire
procured
our
quick
deliverance
from
thence
but
ere
we
went
your
king
quoth
he
him
provide
a
funeral
for
his
son
to
day
our
sword
shall
cut
his
thread
of
life
and
sooner
than
he
thinks
we
be
with
him
to
quittance
those
displeasures
he
hath
done
this
said
we
past
not
daring
to
reply
our
hearts
were
dead
our
looks
diffused
and
wan
wandering
at
last
we
climed
unto
a
hill
from
whence
although
our
grief
were
much
before
yet
now
to
see
the
occasion
with
our
eyes
did
thrice
so
much
increase
our
heaviness
for
there
my
lord
oh
there
we
did
descry
down
in
a
valley
how
both
armies
lay
the
french
had
cast
their
trenches
like
a
ring
and
every
barricado
open
front
was
thick
embossed
with
brazen
ordinance
here
stood
a
battaile
of
ten
thousand
horse
there
twice
as
many
pikes
in
quadrant
wise
here
crossbows
and
deadly
wounding
darts
and
in
the
midst
like
to
a
slender
point
within
the
compass
of
the
horizon
as
twere
a
rising
bubble
in
the
sea
a
hasle
wand
amidst
a
wood
of
pines
or
as
a
bear
fast
chained
unto
a
stake
stood
famous
edward
still
expecting
when
those
dogs
of
france
would
fasten
on
his
flesh
anon
the
death
procuring
knell
begins
off
go
the
cannons
that
with
trembling
noise
did
shake
the
very
mountain
where
they
stood
then
sound
the
trumpets
clangor
in
the
air
the
battles
join
and
when
we
could
no
more
discern
the
difference
twixt
the
friend
and
foe
so
intricate
the
dark
confusion
was
away
we
turned
our
watery
eyes
with
sighs
as
black
as
powder
fuming
into
smoke
and
thus
i
fear
unhappy
have
i
told
the
most
untimely
tale
of
edward
fall
queen
phillip
ah
me
is
this
my
welcome
into
france

this
the
comfort

looked
to

my
beloved

mother
in
the
sea

been
prevented

this
mortal
grief

hope
of
sharp
unheard

dire
he
bids
me
to
provide
his
funeral
and
so
i
will
but
all
the
peers
in
france
shall
mourners
be
and
weep
out
bloody
tears
until
their
empty
veins
be
dry
and
sere
the
pillars
of
his
hearse
shall
be
his
bones
the
mould
that
covers
him
their
city
ashes
his
knell
the
groaning
cries
of
dying
men
and
in
the
stead
of
tapers
on
his
tomb
an
hundred
fifty
towers

burning
blaze

and
herewithall
i
render
to
your
hands
these
prisoners
chief
occasion
of
our
strife
king
edward
so
john
of
france
i
see
you
keep
your
word
you
promised
to
be
sooner
with
our
self
than
we
did
think
for
and
tis
so
in
deed
but
had
you
done
at
first
as
now
you
do
how
many
civil
towns
had
stood
untouched
that
now
are
turned
to
ragged
heaps
of
stones
how
many
people
lives
mightst
thou
have
saved
that
are
untimely
sunk
into
their
graves
king
john
edward
recount
not
things
irrevocable
tell
me
what
ransom
thou
requirest
to
have
king
edward
thy
ransom
john
hereafter
shall
be
known
but
first
to
england
thou
must
cross
the
seas
to
see
what
entertainment
it
affords
how
ere
it
falls
it
can
not
be
so
bad
as
ours
hath
been
since
we
arrived
in
france
king
john
accursed
man
of
this
i
was
foretold
but
did
misconster
what
the
prophet
told
prince
edward
now
father
this
petition
edward
makes
to
thee
whose
grace
hath
been
his
strongest
shield
that
as
thy
pleasure
chose
me
for
the
man
to
be
the
instrument
to
shew
thy
power
so
thou
wilt
grant
that
many
princes
more
bred
and
brought
up
within
that
little
isle
may
still
be
famous
for
like
victories
and
for
my
part
the
bloody
scars
i
bear
and
weary
nights
that
i
have
watched
in
field
the
dangerous
conflicts
i
have
often
had
the
fearful
menaces
were
proffered
me
the
heat
and
cold
and
what
else
might
displease
i
wish
were
now
redoubled
twenty
fold
so
that
hereafter
ages
when
they
read
the
painful
traffic
of
my
tender
youth
might
thereby
be
inflamed
with
such
resolve
as
not
the
territories
of
france
alone
but
likewise
spain
turkey
and
what
countries
else
that
justly
would
provoke
fair
england
ire
might
at
their
presence
tremble
and
retire
king
edward
here
english
lords
we
do
proclaim
a
rest
an
intercession
of
our
painful
arms
sheath
up
your
swords
refresh
your
weary
limbs
peruse
your
spoils
and
after
we
have
breathed
a
day
or
two
within
this
haven
town
god
willing
then
for
england
we
be
shipped
where
in
a
happy
hour
i
trust
we
shall
arrive
three
kings
two
princes
and
a
queen
finis
