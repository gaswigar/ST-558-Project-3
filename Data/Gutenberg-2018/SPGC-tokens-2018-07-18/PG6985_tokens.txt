marriott
walked
into
the
senior
and
finding
no
one
there
hurled
his
portmanteau
down
on
the
table
with
a
bang
the
noise
brought
william
into
the
room
william
was
attached
to
leicester
house
beckford
college
as
a
mixture
of
butler
and
bootboy
he
carried
a
pail
of
water
in
his
hand
he
had
been
engaged
in
cleaning
up
the
house
against
the
conclusion
of
the
summer
holidays
of
which
this
was
the
last
evening
by
the
simple
process
of
transferring
all
dust
dirt
and
other
foreign
substances
from
the
floor
to
his
own
person
mr
marriott
he
said
william
said
marriott
are
you
still
jogging
along
that
a
mercy
i
say
look
here
i
want
a
quiet
word
in
season
with
the
authorities
they
must
have
known
i
was
coming
back
this
evening
of
course
they
did
why
they
specially
wrote
and
asked
me
well
where
the
red
carpet
where
the
awning
where
the
brass
band
that
ought
to
have
met
me
at
the
station
where
anything
i
tell
you
what
it
is
william
my
old
companion
there
a
bad
time
coming
for
the
headmaster
if
he
does
mind
what
he
doing
he
must
learn
that
life
is
stern
and
life
is
earnest
william
has
gethryn
come
back
yet
william
who
had
been
gasping
throughout
this
harangue
for
the
intellectual
pressure
of
marriott
conversation
of
which
there
was
always
plenty
was
generally
too
much
for
him
caught
thankfully
at
the
last
remark
as
being
the
only
intelligible
one
uttered
up
to
present
date
and
made
answer
gethryn
gorn
out
on
to
the
field
mr
marriott
come
an
hour
ago
right
thanks
goodbye
william
give
my
respects
to
the
cook
and
mind
you
do
work
too
hard
think
what
it
would
be
if
you
developed
heart
disease
awful
you
must
do
it
william
marriott
vanished
and
william
slightly
dazed
went
about
his
professional
duties
once
more
marriott
walked
out
into
the
grounds
in
search
of
gethryn
gethryn
was
the
head
of
leicester
this
term
reynolds
departed
and
marriott
who
was
second
man
up
shared
a
study
with
him
leicester
had
not
a
good
name
at
beckford
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
generally
in
the
running
for
the
cricket
and
football
cups
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
with
the
exception
of
gethryn
marriott
a
boy
named
reece
who
kept
wicket
for
the
school
eleven
and
perhaps
two
others
leicester
seniors
were
not
a
good
lot
to
the
school
in
general
who
gauged
a
fellow
character
principally
by
his
abilities
in
the
cricket
and
football
fields
it
seemed
a
very
desirable
thing
to
be
in
leicester
they
had
been
for
the
house
football
cup
that
year
and
this
term
might
easily
see
the
cricket
cup
fall
to
them
amongst
the
few
however
it
was
known
that
the
house
was
passing
through
an
unpleasant
stage
in
its
career
a
house
is
either
good
or
bad
it
is
seldom
that
it
can
combine
the
advantages
of
both
systems
leicester
was
bad
this
was
due
partly
to
a
succession
of
bad
and
partly
to
leicester
himself
who
was
but
weak
his
spirit
was
willing
but
his
will
was
not
spirited
when
things
went
on
that
ought
not
to
have
gone
on
he
generally
managed
to
avoid
seeing
them
and
the
things
continued
to
go
on
altogether
unless
gethryn
rule
should
act
as
a
tonic
leicester
was
in
a
bad
way
the
powers
that
be
however
were
relying
on
gethryn
to
effect
some
improvement
he
was
in
the
sixth
the
first
fifteen
and
the
first
eleven
also
a
backbone
was
included
in
his
anatomy
and
if
he
made
up
his
mind
to
a
thing
that
thing
generally
happened
the
rev
james
beckett
the
headmaster
of
beckford
had
formed
a
very
fair
estimate
of
gethryn
capabilities
and
at
the
moment
when
marriott
was
drawing
the
field
for
the
missing
one
that
worthy
was
sitting
in
the
headmaster
study
with
a
cup
in
his
right
hand
and
a
muffin
in
his
left
drinking
in
tea
and
wisdom
simultaneously
the
head
was
doing
most
of
the
talking
he
had
led
up
to
the
subject
skilfully
and
once
reached
he
did
not
leave
it
the
text
of
his
discourse
was
the
degeneracy
of
leicester
you
know
gethryn
another
muffin
help
yourself
you
know
reynolds
well
he
was
a
capital
boy
in
his
way
capital
and
i
sure
we
shall
all
miss
him
very
much
he
was
not
a
good
head
of
a
house
he
was
weak
much
too
weak
too
you
must
avoid
that
gethryn
reynolds
and
much
more
in
the
same
vein
gethryn
left
the
room
half
an
hour
later
full
of
muffins
and
good
resolutions
he
met
marriott
at
the
have
you
been
to
asked
marriott
been
looking
for
you
all
over
the
shop
and
my
friend
the
headmaster
said
gethryn
been
having
a
quiet
pot
of
tea
between
us
was
he
affable
affable
know
said
marriott
confidentially
asked
me
in
but
i
told
him
it
was
good
enough
i
said
that
if
he
would
consent
to
make
his
tea
with
water
that
was
two
degrees
below
lukewarm
and
bring
on
his
muffins
cooked
instead
of
raw
and
supply
some
butter
to
eat
with
them
i
might
look
him
up
now
and
then
otherwise
it
could
be
done
at
the
price
but
what
did
he
want
you
for
really
was
ragging
me
about
the
house
quite
right
too
you
know
no
doubt
about
it
leicester
does
want
bucking
up
going
to
get
the
cricket
cup
said
marriott
for
the
defence
may
if
it
was
for
the
houses
in
between
school
house
and
jephson
especially
and
anyhow
that
not
what
i
meant
the
games
are
all
right
it
moral
so
to
speak
said
marriott
be
all
right
wait
till
we
get
at
what
i
want
you
to
turn
your
great
brain
to
now
is
this
letter
he
produced
a
letter
from
his
pocket
you
bar
chaps
who
show
you
their
letters
he
said
was
written
by
an
aunt
of
mine
i
want
to
inflict
the
whole
lot
on
you
just
look
at
line
four
you
see
what
she
says
a
boy
is
coming
to
mr
leicester
house
this
term
whom
i
particularly
wish
you
to
befriend
he
is
the
son
of
a
great
friend
of
a
friend
of
mine
and
is
a
nice
bright
little
fellow
very
jolly
and
full
of
spirits
means
interpolated
gethryn
grimly
he
is
up
to
the
eyes
in
pure
undiluted
cheek
and
will
want
kicking
after
every
meal
and
before
retiring
to
rest
go
on
name
is
the
point
at
this
point
the
manuscript
becomes
absolutely
illegible
i
have
conjectured
percy
for
the
first
name
it
may
be
richard
but
i
plunge
on
percy
it
the
surname
that
stumps
me
personally
i
think
it
maccow
though
i
trust
it
is
for
the
sake
i
showed
the
letter
to
my
brother
the
one
who
at
oxford
he
swore
it
was
watson
but
on
being
pressed
hedged
with
sandys
you
may
as
well
contribute
your
little
bit
what
do
you
make
of
it
gethryn
scrutinized
the
document
with
care
begins
with
a
you
can
see
that
letter
a
or
i
see
of
course
it
duncan
so
said
marriott
doubtfully
let
go
and
ask
the
matron
if
she
knows
anything
about
him
jones
he
said
when
they
had
reached
the
house
you
on
your
list
of
new
boys
a
sportsman
of
the
name
of
maccow
or
watson
i
am
also
prepared
to
accept
sandys
or
duncan
the
christian
name
is
either
richard
or
percy
there
that
gives
you
a
fairly
wide
field
to
choose
from
a
wilson
on
the
list
said
the
matron
after
an
inspection
of
that
document
must
be
the
man
said
marriott
very
much
i
suppose
he
has
arrived
yet
not
yet
you
two
are
the
only
ones
so
far
well
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
see
him
when
he
does
come
come
down
for
him
later
on
they
strolled
out
on
to
the
field
again
the
proposed
of
the
house
said
marriott
be
rather
a
big
job
i
should
think
so
we
ought
to
have
a
most
fearfully
sporting
time
it
got
to
be
done
the
old
man
talked
to
me
like
several
fathers
did
he
say
heaps
of
things
know
did
he
mention
amongst
other
things
that
reynolds
was
the
worst
idiot
on
the
face
of
this
world
of
the
sort
i
should
think
the
late
reynolds
was
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
worm
that
not
my
own
but
it
the
only
description
of
him
that
really
suits
monk
and
danvers
and
the
mob
in
general
used
to
do
what
they
liked
with
him
talking
of
monk
when
you
embark
on
your
tour
of
moral
agitation
i
should
advise
you
to
start
with
him
and
danvers
there
is
much
to
choose
between
them
it
a
pity
they
both
such
good
bats
when
you
see
a
chap
putting
them
through
the
slips
like
monk
does
you
ca
help
thinking
there
must
be
something
in
him
there
is
said
marriott
it
all
bad
i
bar
the
man
slimy
it
the
only
word
for
him
and
he
uses
scent
by
the
gallon
thank
goodness
this
is
his
last
term
it
really
i
never
heard
that
he
and
danvers
are
both
leaving
monk
going
to
heidelberg
to
study
german
and
danvers
is
going
into
his
pater
business
in
the
city
i
got
that
from
waterford
is
another
beast
said
gethryn
thoughtfully
suppose
he
not
leaving
by
any
chance
that
i
know
of
but
he
be
nothing
without
monk
and
danvers
he
simply
a
sort
of
to
the
firm
when
they
go
collapse
let
be
strolling
towards
the
house
now
shall
we
hullo
our
only
reece
hullo
reece
said
the
new
arrival
reece
was
a
weird
silent
individual
whom
everybody
in
the
school
knew
up
to
a
certain
point
but
very
few
beyond
that
point
his
manner
was
exactly
the
same
when
talking
to
the
smallest
fag
as
when
addressing
the
headmaster
he
rather
gave
one
the
impression
that
he
was
thinking
of
something
a
fortnight
ahead
or
trying
to
solve
a
chess
problem
without
the
aid
of
the
board
in
appearance
he
was
on
the
short
side
and
thin
he
was
in
the
sixth
and
a
conscientious
worker
indeed
he
was
only
saved
from
being
considered
a
swot
to
use
the
vernacular
by
the
fact
that
from
earliest
hour
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
keeping
wicket
like
an
angel
to
a
good
much
may
be
forgiven
he
handed
gethryn
an
envelope
bishop
he
said
gethryn
was
commonly
known
as
the
bishop
owing
to
a
certain
sermon
preached
in
the
college
chapel
some
five
years
before
in
aid
of
the
church
missionary
society
in
which
the
preacher
had
alluded
at
frequent
intervals
to
another
gethryn
a
bishop
who
it
appeared
had
a
see
and
did
much
excellent
work
among
the
heathen
at
the
back
of
beyond
gethryn
friends
and
acquaintances
who
had
been
alternating
between
gethryn
hair
being
inclined
to
redness
and
a
name
which
utterly
baffles
the
philologist
had
welcomed
the
new
name
warmly
and
it
had
stuck
ever
since
and
after
all
there
are
considerably
worse
names
by
which
one
might
be
called
the
dickens
he
said
as
he
finished
reading
the
letter
us
the
worst
said
marriott
must
read
it
out
now
out
of
common
decency
after
rousing
our
expectations
like
that
right
it
is
private
it
from
an
aunt
of
mine
to
be
a
perfect
glut
of
aunts
said
marriott
views
has
your
representative
got
to
air
is
springing
any
jolly
little
fellow
full
of
spirits
on
this
happy
community
it
not
that
it
only
an
uncle
of
mine
who
coming
down
here
he
coming
tomorrow
and
i
to
meet
him
the
uncanny
part
of
it
is
that
i
never
heard
of
him
before
in
my
life
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
heard
began
reece
slowly
observations
were
not
frequent
but
when
they
came
did
so
for
the
most
part
in
anecdotal
shape
somebody
was
constantly
doing
something
which
reminded
him
of
something
he
had
heard
somewhere
from
somebody
the
unfortunate
part
of
it
was
that
he
exuded
these
reminiscences
at
such
a
leisurely
rate
of
speed
that
he
was
rarely
known
to
succeed
in
finishing
any
of
them
he
resembled
those
serial
stories
which
appear
in
papers
destined
at
a
moderate
price
to
fill
an
obvious
void
and
which
break
off
abruptly
at
the
third
chapter
owing
to
the
premature
decease
of
the
said
periodicals
on
this
occasion
marriott
cut
in
with
a
few
sage
remarks
on
the
subject
of
uncles
as
a
class
he
said
tricky
you
never
know
where
you
got
you
think
they
going
to
come
out
strong
with
a
sovereign
and
they
make
it
a
shilling
without
a
blush
an
uncle
of
mine
once
gave
me
a
threepenny
bit
if
it
had
been
that
i
did
wish
to
hurt
his
feelings
i
should
have
flung
it
at
his
feet
also
i
particularly
wanted
threepence
at
the
moment
is
your
uncle
likely
to
do
his
duty
bishop
tell
you
i
do
know
the
man
never
heard
of
him
i
thought
i
knew
every
uncle
on
the
list
but
i
ca
place
this
one
however
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
meet
him
said
marriott
as
they
went
into
the
house
should
always
strive
to
be
kind
even
to
the
very
humblest
on
the
off
chance
you
know
the
unknown
may
have
struck
it
rich
in
sheep
or
something
out
in
australia
most
uncles
come
from
australia
or
he
may
be
the
boss
of
some
trust
and
wallowing
in
dollars
he
may
be
anything
let
go
and
brew
bishop
come
on
reece
do
mind
watching
you
two
chaps
eat
said
gethryn
i
join
in
myself
i
have
assimilated
three
pounds
odd
of
the
headmagisterial
muffins
already
this
afternoon
do
mind
me
though
they
went
upstairs
to
marriott
study
which
was
also
gethryn
two
in
a
study
was
the
rule
at
beckford
though
there
were
recluses
who
lived
alone
and
seemed
to
enjoy
it
when
the
festive
board
had
ceased
to
groan
and
the
cake
which
marriott
mother
had
expected
to
last
a
fortnight
had
been
reduced
to
a
mere
wreck
of
its
former
self
the
thought
of
his
aunt
friend
son
returned
to
marriott
and
he
went
down
to
investigate
returning
shortly
afterwards
unaccompanied
but
evidently
full
of
news
said
gethryn
he
come
little
said
marriott
a
little
i
went
down
to
the
room
and
when
i
opened
the
door
i
noticed
a
certain
weird
stillness
in
the
atmosphere
there
is
usually
a
row
going
on
that
you
could
cut
with
a
knife
i
looked
about
the
room
was
apparently
empty
then
i
observed
a
quaint
object
on
the
horizon
do
you
know
one
skinner
by
any
chance
dear
chap
said
gethryn
skinner
was
a
sort
of
juvenile
professor
moriarty
a
napoleon
of
crime
he
reeked
of
crime
he
revelled
in
his
wicked
deeds
if
a
was
kept
awake
at
night
by
some
diabolically
ingenious
contrivance
for
combining
the
minimum
of
risk
with
the
maximum
of
noise
then
it
was
skinner
who
had
engineered
the
thing
again
did
a
master
playing
nervously
forward
on
a
bad
pitch
at
the
nets
to
gosling
the
school
fast
bowler
receive
the
ball
gaspingly
in
the
small
ribs
and
look
round
to
see
whose
was
that
raucous
laugh
which
had
greeted
the
performance
he
would
observe
a
couple
of
yards
away
skinner
deep
in
conversation
with
some
friend
of
equally
villainous
aspect
in
short
in
a
word
the
only
adequate
word
he
was
skinner
said
reece
proceeded
marriott
seated
in
a
chair
bleeding
freely
into
a
rather
dirty
his
usual
genial
smile
was
hampered
by
a
cut
lip
and
his
right
eye
was
blacked
in
the
most
graceful
and
pleasing
manner
i
made
tender
inquiries
but
could
get
nothing
from
him
except
grunts
so
i
departed
and
just
outside
the
door
i
met
young
lee
and
got
the
facts
out
of
him
it
appears
that
wilson
my
aunt
friend
friend
son
entered
the
fags
room
at
at
punctually
skinner
was
observed
to
be
trying
to
rag
him
apparently
the
great
percy
has
no
sense
of
humour
for
at
he
got
tired
of
it
and
hit
skinner
crisply
in
the
right
eyeball
blacking
the
same
as
per
illustration
the
subsequent
fight
raged
gorily
for
five
minutes
odd
and
then
wilson
who
seems
to
be
a
professional
pugilist
in
disguise
landed
what
my
informant
describes
as
three
corkers
on
his
proboscis
skinner
reply
was
to
sit
down
heavily
on
the
floor
and
give
him
to
understand
that
the
fight
was
over
and
that
for
the
next
day
or
two
his
face
would
be
closed
for
alterations
and
repairs
wilson
thereupon
harangued
the
company
in
terms
tried
to
get
skinner
to
shake
hands
but
failed
and
finally
took
the
entire
crew
out
to
the
shop
where
they
made
pigs
of
themselves
at
his
expense
i
have
spoken
that
the
kid
you
got
to
look
after
said
reece
after
a
pause
said
marriott
i
maintain
is
that
i
require
a
kid
built
on
those
lines
to
look
after
me
but
you
ought
to
go
down
and
see
skinner
eye
sometime
it
a
beautiful
bit
of
work
introduces
an
unusual
uncle
on
the
following
day
at
nine
the
term
formally
began
there
is
nothing
of
black
monday
about
the
first
day
of
term
at
a
public
school
black
monday
is
essentially
a
private
school
institution
at
beckford
the
first
day
of
every
term
was
a
half
holiday
during
the
morning
a
feeble
pretence
of
work
was
kept
up
but
after
lunch
the
school
was
free
to
do
as
it
pleased
and
to
go
where
it
liked
the
nets
were
put
up
for
the
first
time
and
the
school
professional
emerged
at
last
from
his
winter
retirement
with
his
out
to
sir
right
forward
which
had
helped
so
many
beckford
cricketers
to
do
their
duty
by
the
school
in
the
field
there
was
one
net
for
the
elect
the
remnants
of
last
year
eleven
and
the
for
this
season
and
half
a
dozen
more
for
lesser
lights
at
the
first
net
norris
was
batting
to
the
bowling
of
gosling
a
long
thin
day
boy
gethryn
and
the
professional
as
useful
a
trio
as
any
school
batsman
could
wish
for
norris
was
captain
of
the
team
this
year
a
sound
stylish
bat
with
a
stroke
after
the
manner
of
tyldesley
between
cover
and
which
used
to
make
miles
the
professional
almost
weep
with
joy
but
today
he
had
evidently
not
quite
got
into
form
twice
in
successive
balls
gosling
knocked
his
leg
stump
out
of
the
ground
with
yorkers
and
the
ball
after
that
gethryn
upset
his
middle
with
a
beauty
norris
shouted
gosling
see
a
bit
today
bowled
bishop
a
second
teaser
from
gethryn
had
almost
got
through
his
defence
the
bishop
was
undoubtedly
a
fine
bowler
without
being
quite
so
fast
as
gosling
he
nevertheless
contrived
to
work
up
a
very
considerable
speed
when
he
wished
to
and
there
was
always
something
in
every
ball
he
bowled
which
made
it
necessary
for
the
batsman
to
watch
it
all
the
way
in
matches
against
other
schools
it
was
generally
gosling
who
took
the
wickets
the
batsmen
were
bothered
by
his
pace
but
when
the
or
the
incogniti
came
down
bringing
seasoned
county
men
who
knew
what
fast
bowling
really
was
and
rather
preferred
it
on
the
whole
to
slow
then
gethryn
was
called
upon
most
beckfordians
who
did
not
play
cricket
on
the
first
day
of
term
went
on
the
river
a
few
rode
bicycles
or
strolled
out
into
the
country
in
couples
but
the
majority
amongst
whom
on
this
occasion
was
marriott
sallied
to
the
water
and
hired
boats
marriott
was
one
of
the
six
old
cricket
colours
the
others
were
norris
gosling
gethryn
reece
and
pringle
of
the
school
house
who
formed
the
foundation
of
this
year
eleven
he
was
not
an
ornamental
bat
but
stood
quite
alone
in
the
matter
of
tall
hitting
twenty
minutes
of
marriott
when
in
form
would
often
completely
alter
the
course
of
a
match
he
had
been
given
his
colours
in
the
previous
year
for
making
exactly
a
hundred
in
minutes
against
the
authentics
when
the
rest
of
the
team
had
contributed
the
authentics
made
a
hundred
and
so
that
the
school
just
won
and
the
story
of
how
there
were
five
men
out
in
the
deep
for
him
and
how
he
put
the
slow
bowler
over
their
heads
and
over
the
ropes
eight
times
in
three
overs
had
passed
into
a
school
legend
but
today
other
things
than
cricket
occupied
his
attention
he
had
run
wilson
to
earth
and
was
engaged
in
making
his
acquaintance
according
to
instructions
received
you
wilson
he
asked
wilson
wilson
confirmed
the
charge
name
marriott
does
that
convey
any
significance
to
your
young
mind
yes
my
mater
knows
somebody
who
knows
your
aunt
is
a
true
bill
she
said
you
would
look
after
me
i
know
you
wo
have
time
of
course
expect
i
shall
have
time
to
give
you
all
the
looking
after
require
it
wo
be
much
from
all
i
heard
was
all
that
true
about
you
and
young
skinner
wilson
grinned
did
have
a
bit
of
a
row
with
a
chap
called
skinner
he
admitted
skinner
seems
to
think
said
marriott
was
it
all
about
he
made
an
ass
of
himself
said
wilson
vaguely
marriott
nodded
would
i
know
the
man
i
should
think
you
have
much
trouble
with
skinner
in
the
future
by
the
way
i
got
you
for
a
fag
this
term
you
do
have
to
do
much
in
the
summer
just
rot
around
you
know
and
go
to
the
shop
for
biscuits
and
things
that
all
and
within
limits
of
course
you
get
the
run
of
the
study
see
said
wilson
gratefully
the
prospect
was
pleasant
yes
and
it
your
privilege
to
my
cricket
boots
occasionally
before
first
matches
you
like
that
can
you
steer
a
boat
do
think
so
i
never
tried
easy
enough
i
tell
you
what
to
do
anyhow
you
probably
steer
any
worse
than
i
row
so
let
go
and
get
a
boat
out
and
try
and
think
of
a
few
more
words
of
wisdom
for
your
benefit
at
the
nets
norris
had
finished
his
innings
and
pringle
was
batting
in
his
stead
gethryn
had
given
up
his
ball
to
baynes
who
bowled
slow
and
was
the
most
probable
of
the
probables
he
went
to
where
norris
was
taking
off
his
pads
and
began
to
talk
to
him
norris
was
the
head
of
jephson
house
and
he
and
the
bishop
were
very
good
friends
in
a
casual
sort
of
way
if
they
did
not
see
one
another
for
a
couple
of
days
neither
of
them
broke
his
heart
whenever
on
the
other
hand
they
did
meet
they
were
always
glad
and
always
had
plenty
to
talk
about
most
school
friendships
are
of
that
description
were
sending
down
some
rather
hot
stuff
said
norris
as
gethryn
sat
down
beside
him
and
began
to
inspect
pringle
performance
with
a
critical
eye
did
feel
rather
fit
said
he
i
do
think
half
those
that
got
you
would
have
taken
wickets
in
a
match
you
are
in
form
yet
tell
you
what
it
is
bishop
said
norris
believe
i
going
to
be
a
rank
failure
this
season
being
captain
does
put
one
off
be
an
idiot
man
how
can
you
possibly
tell
after
one
day
play
at
the
nets
do
know
i
feel
so
beastly
anxious
somehow
i
feel
as
if
i
was
personally
responsible
for
every
match
lost
it
was
all
right
last
year
when
john
brown
was
captain
good
old
john
do
you
remember
his
running
you
out
in
the
charchester
match
said
gethryn
pathetically
only
time
i
ever
felt
as
if
i
really
was
going
to
make
that
century
by
jove
see
that
drive
pringle
seems
all
right
you
know
he
simply
walk
into
his
blue
when
he
goes
up
to
the
varsity
what
do
you
think
of
baynes
to
be
rather
useful
on
his
wicket
jephson
thinks
he
good
mr
jephson
looked
after
the
school
cricket
i
believe
he
rather
fancies
him
said
norris
he
ought
to
do
some
big
things
if
we
get
any
rain
hullo
pringle
are
you
coming
out
you
better
go
in
then
bishop
right
thanks
oh
by
jove
though
i
forgot
i
ca
i
got
to
go
down
to
the
station
to
meet
an
uncle
of
mine
he
coming
up
today
for
why
did
he
wait
till
we
got
a
match
of
sorts
on
do
know
the
man
probably
a
lunatic
anyhow
i
shall
have
to
go
and
meet
him
and
i
shall
just
do
it
comfortably
if
i
go
and
change
now
right
you
are
sammy
do
you
want
a
knock
samuel
wilberforce
gosling
known
to
his
friends
and
admirers
as
sammy
replied
that
he
did
not
all
he
wanted
now
he
said
was
a
drink
or
possibly
two
drinks
and
a
jolly
good
rest
in
the
shade
somewhere
gosling
was
one
of
those
rare
individuals
who
cultivate
bowling
at
the
expense
of
batting
a
habit
the
reverse
of
what
usually
obtains
in
schools
norris
admitted
the
justice
of
his
claims
and
sent
in
a
second
eleven
man
baker
a
member
of
his
own
house
in
pringle
place
pringle
and
gosling
adjourned
to
the
school
shop
for
refreshment
gethryn
walked
with
them
as
far
as
the
gate
which
opened
on
to
the
road
where
most
of
the
boarding
houses
stood
and
then
branched
off
in
the
direction
of
leicester
to
change
into
everyday
costume
took
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
end
of
which
period
he
left
the
house
and
began
to
walk
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
station
it
was
an
hour
easy
walking
between
horton
the
nearest
station
to
beckford
and
the
college
gethryn
who
was
rather
tired
after
his
exertions
at
the
nets
took
it
very
easily
and
when
he
arrived
at
his
destination
the
church
clock
was
striking
four
the
in
yet
he
asked
of
the
solitary
porter
who
ministered
to
the
needs
of
the
traveller
at
horton
station
in
now
zur
said
the
porter
adding
in
a
sort
of
inspired
frenzy
stertion
and
ringing
a
bell
with
immense
enthusiasm
and
vigour
gethryn
strolled
to
the
gate
where
the
son
stood
at
the
receipt
of
custom
to
collect
the
tickets
his
uncle
was
to
arrive
by
this
train
and
if
he
did
so
arrive
must
of
necessity
pass
this
way
before
leaving
the
platform
the
train
panted
in
pulled
up
whistled
and
puffed
out
again
leaving
three
people
behind
it
one
of
these
was
a
woman
of
sixty
approximately
the
second
a
small
girl
of
ten
the
third
a
young
gentleman
in
a
top
hat
and
etons
who
carried
a
bag
and
looked
as
if
he
had
seen
the
hollowness
of
things
for
his
face
wore
a
bored
supercilious
look
his
uncle
had
evidently
not
arrived
unless
he
had
come
disguised
as
an
old
woman
an
act
of
which
gethryn
refused
to
believe
him
capable
he
enquired
as
to
the
next
train
that
was
expected
to
arrive
from
london
the
son
was
not
sure
but
would
ask
the
porter
whose
name
it
appeared
was
johnny
johnny
gave
the
correct
answer
without
an
effort
it
was
sir
except
on
saturdays
when
it
was
eight
said
the
bishop
the
man
he
might
at
least
have
wired
he
registered
a
silent
wish
concerning
the
uncle
who
had
brought
him
a
long
three
miles
out
of
his
way
with
nothing
to
show
at
the
end
of
it
and
was
just
turning
to
leave
the
station
when
the
small
boy
who
had
been
hovering
round
the
group
during
the
conversation
addressed
winged
words
to
him
these
were
the
winged
words
say
are
you
looking
for
somebody
the
bishop
stared
at
him
as
a
naturalist
stares
at
a
novel
species
of
insect
he
said
your
name
gethryn
this
affair
thought
the
bishop
was
beginning
to
assume
an
uncanny
aspect
the
dickens
did
you
know
that
he
said
then
you
are
gethryn
that
all
right
i
was
told
you
were
going
to
be
here
to
meet
this
train
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
my
name
farnie
i
your
uncle
you
know
what
gurgled
the
bishop
uncle
un
kul
uncle
fact
i
assure
you
the
uncle
makes
himself
at
home
dash
it
said
gethryn
when
he
had
finished
gasping
must
be
rot
a
bit
said
the
youth
mater
was
my
elder
sister
you
find
it
works
out
all
right
look
here
a
the
daughter
of
b
and
c
marries
no
look
here
i
was
born
when
you
were
four
see
then
the
demoralized
bishop
remembered
he
had
heard
of
his
juvenile
uncle
but
the
tales
had
made
little
impression
upon
him
till
now
they
had
not
crossed
one
another
tracks
all
right
said
he
take
your
word
for
it
you
seem
to
have
been
getting
up
the
subject
thought
you
might
want
to
know
about
it
i
say
how
far
is
it
to
beckford
and
how
do
you
get
there
up
till
now
gethryn
had
scarcely
realized
that
his
uncle
was
actually
coming
to
the
school
for
good
these
words
brought
the
fact
home
to
him
lord
he
said
you
coming
to
beckford
the
thought
of
having
his
footsteps
perpetually
dogged
by
an
uncle
four
years
younger
than
himself
and
manifestly
a
youth
with
a
fine
taste
in
cheek
was
not
pleasant
course
said
his
uncle
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
do
camp
out
on
the
platform
house
are
you
in
the
worst
had
happened
the
bitter
cup
was
full
the
iron
neatly
inserted
in
gethryn
soul
in
his
most
pessimistic
moments
he
had
never
looked
forward
to
the
coming
term
so
gloomily
as
he
did
now
his
uncle
noted
his
lack
of
enthusiasm
and
attributed
it
to
anxiety
on
behalf
of
himself
up
he
asked
leicester
all
right
is
leicester
a
beast
he
a
perfectly
decent
sort
of
man
it
a
good
enough
house
at
least
it
will
be
this
term
i
was
only
thinking
of
something
see
well
how
do
you
get
to
the
place
it
is
far
far
miles
porter
said
four
may
be
four
i
never
measured
it
how
the
dickens
do
you
think
i
going
to
walk
four
miles
with
luggage
i
wish
you
would
rot
and
before
gethryn
could
quite
realize
that
he
the
head
of
leicester
the
bowler
in
the
school
and
the
best
centre
the
school
had
had
for
four
seasons
had
been
requested
in
a
peremptory
manner
by
a
youth
of
fourteen
a
mere
kid
not
to
rot
the
offender
was
talking
to
a
cabman
out
of
the
reach
of
retaliation
gethryn
became
more
convinced
every
minute
that
this
was
no
ordinary
kid
man
says
observed
farnie
returning
to
gethryn
drive
me
up
to
the
college
for
seven
bob
as
it
a
short
four
miles
and
i
only
got
two
boxes
it
seems
to
me
that
he
doing
himself
fairly
well
what
do
you
think
ever
gives
more
than
four
bob
said
gethryn
told
you
so
said
farnie
to
the
cabman
are
a
bally
swindler
he
added
admiringly
began
the
cabman
in
a
pained
voice
dry
up
said
farnie
a
lift
gethryn
the
words
were
spoken
not
so
much
as
from
equal
to
equal
as
in
a
tone
of
airy
patronage
which
made
the
bishop
blood
boil
but
as
he
intended
to
instil
a
few
words
of
wisdom
into
his
uncle
mind
he
did
not
refuse
the
offer
the
cabman
apparently
accepting
the
situation
as
one
of
those
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
which
no
man
can
hope
to
escape
settled
down
on
the
box
clicked
up
his
horse
and
drove
on
towards
the
college
sort
of
a
hole
is
beckford
asked
farnie
after
the
silence
had
lasted
some
time
find
it
good
enough
personally
said
gethryn
you
let
us
know
earlier
that
you
were
coming
we
have
had
the
place
done
up
a
bit
for
you
this
of
course
was
feeble
distinctly
feeble
but
the
bishop
was
not
feeling
himself
the
essay
in
sarcasm
left
the
victim
entirely
uncrushed
he
should
have
shrunk
and
withered
up
or
at
the
least
have
blushed
but
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
he
merely
smiled
in
his
supercilious
way
until
the
bishop
felt
very
much
inclined
to
spring
upon
him
and
throw
him
out
of
the
cab
there
was
another
pause
began
gethryn
at
last
it
strike
you
that
for
a
kid
like
you
you
got
a
good
deal
of
edge
on
asked
gethryn
farnie
effected
a
masterly
he
pretended
not
to
be
able
to
hear
he
was
sorry
but
would
the
bishop
mind
repeating
his
remark
what
he
said
sorry
but
this
cab
making
such
a
row
i
say
cabby
why
do
you
sign
the
pledge
and
save
your
money
up
to
buy
a
new
cab
eh
oh
sorry
i
was
listening
now
inasmuch
as
the
whole
virtue
of
the
argument
lies
in
the
crisp
despatch
with
which
it
is
delivered
gethryn
began
to
find
on
repeating
his
observation
for
the
third
time
that
there
was
not
quite
so
much
in
it
as
he
had
thought
he
prudently
elected
to
change
his
style
of
attack
does
matter
he
said
wearily
as
farnie
opened
his
mouth
to
demand
a
fourth
encore
was
anything
important
now
look
here
i
just
want
to
give
you
a
few
tips
about
what
to
do
when
you
get
to
the
coll
to
start
with
you
have
to
take
off
that
white
tie
you
got
on
black
and
dark
blue
are
the
only
sorts
allowed
here
about
yours
then
gethryn
was
wearing
a
somewhat
sweet
thing
in
brown
and
yellow
happens
to
be
a
first
eleven
tie
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
know
i
was
going
to
take
off
my
tie
i
always
do
especially
at
night
it
a
sort
of
habit
i
got
into
quite
so
much
of
your
beastly
cheek
please
said
gethryn
said
farnie
cheerfully
and
silence
broken
only
by
the
shrieking
of
the
cab
wheels
brooded
once
more
over
the
cab
then
gethryn
feeling
that
perhaps
it
would
be
a
shame
to
jump
too
severely
on
a
new
boy
on
his
first
day
at
a
large
public
school
began
to
think
of
something
conciliatory
to
say
here
he
said
get
on
all
right
at
beckford
i
expect
you
find
leicester
a
fairly
decent
sort
of
house
anyhow
you
need
be
afraid
you
get
bullied
there
none
of
that
sort
of
thing
at
school
nowadays
and
there
another
thing
i
ought
to
warn
you
about
have
you
brought
much
money
with
you
fourteen
pounds
i
fancy
said
farnie
carelessly
said
the
amazed
bishop
sovereigns
said
farnie
worth
twenty
shillings
you
know
for
a
moment
gethryn
only
feeling
was
one
of
unmixed
envy
previously
he
had
considered
himself
passing
rich
on
thirty
shillings
a
term
he
had
heard
legends
of
course
of
individuals
who
come
to
school
bursting
with
bullion
but
never
before
had
he
set
eyes
upon
such
an
one
but
after
a
time
it
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
for
a
new
boy
at
a
public
school
and
especially
at
such
a
house
as
leicester
had
become
under
the
rule
of
the
late
reynolds
and
his
predecessors
there
might
be
such
a
thing
as
having
too
much
money
the
deuce
did
you
get
all
that
he
asked
pater
gave
it
me
he
absolutely
cracked
on
the
subject
of
sometimes
he
does
give
me
a
sou
and
sometimes
give
me
whatever
i
ask
for
you
do
mean
to
say
you
had
the
cheek
to
ask
for
fourteen
quid
asked
for
fifteen
got
it
too
i
spent
a
pound
of
it
i
said
i
wanted
to
buy
a
bike
you
can
get
a
jolly
good
bike
for
five
quid
about
so
you
see
i
scoop
ten
pounds
what
this
ingenious
if
slightly
unscrupulous
feat
gave
gethryn
an
insight
into
his
uncle
character
which
up
till
now
he
had
lacked
he
began
to
see
that
the
moral
advice
with
which
he
had
primed
himself
would
be
out
of
place
evidently
this
youth
could
take
quite
good
care
of
himself
on
his
own
account
still
even
a
budding
professor
moriarty
would
be
none
the
worse
for
being
warned
against
gethryn
monk
so
the
bishop
proceeded
to
deliver
that
warning
he
said
seem
to
be
able
to
look
out
for
yourself
all
right
i
must
say
but
there
one
tip
i
really
can
give
you
when
you
get
to
leicester
and
a
beast
with
a
green
complexion
and
an
oily
smile
comes
up
and
calls
you
old
and
wants
you
to
swear
eternal
friendship
tell
him
it
not
good
enough
squash
him
said
farnie
is
this
genial
merchant
called
monk
you
recognize
him
by
the
smell
of
scent
when
you
find
the
place
smelling
like
an
factory
you
know
monk
somewhere
near
do
you
have
anything
to
do
with
him
seem
to
dislike
the
gentleman
bar
the
man
but
that
is
why
i
giving
you
the
tip
to
steer
clear
of
him
there
are
dozens
of
chaps
i
bar
who
have
an
ounce
of
vice
in
them
and
there
are
one
or
two
chaps
who
have
got
tons
one
of
them
a
fellow
called
danvers
is
another
also
a
beast
of
the
name
of
waterford
there
are
some
others
as
well
but
those
are
the
worst
of
the
lot
by
the
way
i
forgot
to
ask
have
you
ever
been
to
school
before
said
farnie
in
the
dreamy
voice
of
one
who
recalls
memories
from
the
misty
past
was
at
harrow
before
i
came
here
and
at
wellington
before
i
went
to
harrow
and
at
clifton
before
i
went
to
wellington
gethryn
gasped
before
you
went
to
clifton
he
enquired
private
schools
the
recollection
of
the
platitudes
which
he
had
been
delivering
under
the
impression
that
he
was
talking
to
an
entirely
raw
beginner
made
gethryn
feel
slightly
uncomfortable
what
must
this
wanderer
who
had
seen
men
and
cities
have
thought
of
his
harangue
did
you
leave
harrow
asked
he
was
the
laconic
reply
have
you
ever
asks
a
modern
philosopher
gone
upstairs
in
the
dark
and
trodden
on
the
last
step
when
it
was
there
that
sensation
and
the
one
gethryn
felt
at
this
unexpected
revelation
were
identical
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
felt
the
keenest
desire
to
know
why
harrow
had
seen
fit
to
dispense
with
the
presence
of
his
uncle
he
began
mean
he
went
on
hurriedly
did
you
leave
wellington
said
farnie
again
with
the
monotonous
persistence
of
a
solomon
eagle
gethryn
felt
at
this
juncture
much
as
the
unfortunate
gentleman
in
must
have
felt
when
having
finished
a
humorous
story
the
point
of
which
turned
upon
squinting
and
red
noses
he
suddenly
discovered
that
his
host
enjoyed
both
those
peculiarities
he
struggled
manfully
with
his
feelings
for
a
time
tact
urged
him
to
discontinue
his
investigations
and
talk
about
the
weather
curiosity
insisted
upon
knowing
further
details
just
as
the
struggle
was
at
its
height
farnie
came
unexpectedly
to
the
rescue
may
interest
you
he
said
know
that
i
was
not
sacked
from
clifton
gethryn
with
some
difficulty
refrained
from
thanking
him
for
the
information
never
stop
at
a
school
long
said
farnie
i
do
get
sacked
my
father
takes
me
away
after
a
couple
of
terms
i
went
to
four
private
schools
before
i
started
on
the
public
schools
my
pater
took
me
away
from
the
first
two
because
he
thought
the
drains
were
bad
the
third
because
they
would
teach
me
shorthand
and
the
fourth
because
he
did
like
the
headmaster
face
i
worked
off
those
schools
in
a
year
and
a
half
having
finished
this
piece
of
autobiography
he
relapsed
into
silence
leaving
gethryn
to
recollect
various
tales
he
had
heard
of
his
grandfather
eccentricity
the
silence
lasted
until
the
college
was
reached
when
the
matron
took
charge
of
farnie
and
gethryn
went
off
to
tell
marriott
of
these
strange
happenings
marriott
was
amused
nor
did
he
attempt
to
conceal
the
fact
when
he
had
finished
laughing
which
was
not
for
some
time
he
favoured
the
bishop
with
a
very
sound
piece
of
advice
i
were
you
he
said
should
try
and
hush
this
affair
up
it
all
fearfully
funny
but
i
think
you
enjoy
life
more
if
nobody
knew
this
kid
was
your
uncle
to
see
the
head
of
the
house
going
about
with
a
juvenile
uncle
in
his
wake
might
amuse
the
chaps
rather
and
you
might
find
it
harder
to
keep
order
i
wo
let
it
out
and
nobody
else
knows
apparently
go
and
square
the
kid
oh
i
say
though
what
his
name
if
it
gethryn
you
done
unless
you
like
to
swear
he
a
cousin
his
name
farnie
thank
goodness
all
right
then
go
and
talk
to
him
gethryn
went
to
the
junior
study
farnie
was
holding
forth
to
a
knot
of
fags
at
one
end
of
the
room
his
audience
appeared
to
be
amused
at
something
say
farnie
said
the
bishop
a
second
farnie
came
out
and
gethryn
proceeded
to
inform
him
that
all
things
considered
and
proud
as
he
was
of
the
relationship
it
was
not
absolutely
essential
that
he
should
tell
everybody
that
he
was
his
uncle
in
fact
it
would
be
rather
better
on
the
whole
if
he
did
not
did
he
follow
farnie
begged
to
observe
that
he
did
follow
but
that
to
his
sorrow
the
warning
came
too
late
very
sorry
he
said
had
the
least
idea
you
wanted
the
thing
kept
dark
how
was
i
to
know
i
just
been
telling
it
to
some
of
the
chaps
in
there
awfully
decent
chaps
they
seemed
to
think
it
rather
funny
anyhow
i
not
ashamed
of
the
relationship
not
yet
at
any
rate
for
a
moment
gethryn
seemed
about
to
speak
he
looked
fixedly
at
his
uncle
as
he
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
a
cheerful
column
of
cool
calm
concentrated
cheek
then
as
if
realizing
that
no
words
that
he
knew
could
do
justice
to
the
situation
he
raised
his
foot
in
silence
and
his
own
flesh
and
blood
with
marked
emphasis
after
which
ceremony
he
went
still
without
a
word
upstairs
again
as
for
farnie
he
returned
to
the
junior
whistling
south
in
a
soft
but
cheerful
key
and
solidified
his
growing
popularity
with
doles
of
food
from
a
hamper
which
he
had
brought
with
him
finally
on
retiring
to
bed
and
being
pressed
by
the
rest
of
his
dormitory
for
a
story
he
embarked
upon
the
history
of
a
certain
pollock
and
an
individual
referred
to
throughout
as
the
porroh
man
the
former
of
whom
caused
the
latter
to
be
decapitated
and
was
ever
afterwards
haunted
by
his
head
which
appeared
to
him
all
day
and
every
day
not
excepting
sundays
and
bank
holidays
in
an
position
and
wearing
a
horrible
grin
in
the
end
pollock
very
sensibly
committed
suicide
with
ghastly
details
and
the
dormitory
thanked
farnie
in
a
subdued
and
chastened
manner
and
tried
with
small
success
to
go
to
sleep
in
short
farnie
first
evening
at
beckford
had
been
quite
a
triumph
pringle
makes
a
sporting
offer
estimating
it
roughly
it
takes
a
new
boy
at
a
public
school
about
a
week
to
find
his
legs
and
shed
his
skin
of
newness
the
period
is
of
course
longer
in
the
case
of
some
and
shorter
in
the
case
of
others
both
farnie
and
wilson
had
made
themselves
at
home
immediately
in
the
case
of
the
latter
directly
the
skinner
episode
had
been
noised
abroad
and
it
was
discovered
in
addition
that
he
was
a
promising
bat
public
opinion
recognized
that
here
was
a
youth
out
of
the
common
run
of
new
boys
and
the
lower
fourth
the
form
in
which
he
had
been
placed
on
arrival
took
him
to
its
bosom
as
an
equal
farnie
case
was
exceptional
a
career
at
harrow
clifton
and
wellington
however
short
and
abruptly
terminated
gives
one
some
sort
of
grip
on
the
way
public
school
life
is
conducted
at
an
early
date
moreover
he
gave
signs
of
what
almost
amounted
to
genius
in
the
indoor
game
department
now
success
in
the
field
is
a
good
thing
and
undoubtedly
makes
for
popularity
but
if
you
desire
to
command
the
respect
and
admiration
of
your
to
a
degree
stretched
almost
to
the
point
of
idolatry
make
yourself
proficient
in
the
art
of
whiling
away
the
hours
of
afternoon
school
before
farnie
arrival
his
form
the
upper
fourth
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
had
not
been
skilful
they
had
ragged
in
an
intermittent
sort
of
way
when
however
he
came
on
the
scene
he
introduced
a
welcome
element
of
science
into
the
sport
as
witness
the
following
mr
strudwick
the
regular
master
of
the
form
happened
on
one
occasion
to
be
away
for
a
couple
of
days
and
a
was
put
in
in
his
place
the
name
of
the
was
mr
somerville
smith
he
and
farnie
exchanged
an
unspoken
declaration
of
war
almost
immediately
the
first
round
went
in
mr
smith
favour
he
contrived
to
catch
farnie
in
the
act
of
performing
some
ingenious
breach
of
the
peace
and
it
being
a
wednesday
and
a
sent
him
into
extra
lesson
on
the
following
morning
more
by
design
than
accident
farnie
upset
an
inkpot
mr
smith
observed
icily
that
unless
the
stain
was
wiped
away
before
the
beginning
of
afternoon
school
there
would
be
trouble
farnie
observed
to
himself
that
there
would
be
trouble
in
any
case
for
he
had
hit
upon
the
central
idea
for
the
most
colossal
that
in
his
opinion
ever
was
after
morning
school
he
gathered
the
form
around
him
and
disclosed
his
idea
the
floor
of
the
he
pointed
out
was
some
dozen
inches
below
the
level
of
the
door
would
it
not
be
a
pleasant
and
profitable
notion
he
asked
to
flood
the
floor
with
water
to
the
depth
of
those
dozen
inches
on
the
wall
outside
the
hung
a
row
of
buckets
placed
there
in
case
of
fire
and
the
lavatory
was
not
too
far
off
for
practical
purposes
mr
smith
had
bidden
him
wash
the
floor
it
was
obviously
his
duty
to
do
so
the
form
thought
so
too
for
a
solid
hour
thirty
weary
but
enthusiastic
reprobates
laboured
without
ceasing
and
by
the
time
the
bell
rang
all
was
prepared
the
floor
was
one
still
silent
pool
two
caps
and
a
few
notebooks
floated
sluggishly
on
the
surface
relieving
the
picture
of
any
tendency
to
monotony
the
form
crept
silently
to
their
places
along
the
desks
as
mr
smith
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
they
began
to
beat
vigorously
upon
the
desks
with
the
result
that
mr
smith
quickening
his
pace
dashed
into
the
at
a
hard
gallop
the
immediate
results
were
absolutely
satisfactory
and
if
matters
subsequently
when
mr
smith
having
changed
his
clothes
returned
with
the
headmaster
did
get
somewhat
warm
for
the
thirty
criminals
they
had
the
satisfying
feeling
that
their
duty
had
been
done
and
a
hearty
and
unanimous
vote
of
thanks
was
passed
to
farnie
from
which
it
will
be
seen
that
master
reginald
farnie
was
managing
to
extract
more
or
less
enjoyment
out
of
his
life
at
beckford
another
person
who
was
enjoying
life
was
pringle
of
the
school
house
the
keynote
of
pringle
character
was
superiority
at
an
early
period
of
his
life
he
was
still
unable
to
speak
at
the
time
his
grandmother
had
died
this
is
probably
the
sole
reason
why
he
had
never
taught
that
relative
to
suck
eggs
had
she
lived
her
education
in
that
direction
must
have
been
taken
in
hand
baffled
in
this
pringle
had
turned
his
attention
to
the
rest
of
the
human
race
he
had
a
rooted
conviction
that
he
did
everything
a
shade
better
than
anybody
else
this
belief
did
not
make
him
arrogant
at
all
and
certainly
not
offensive
for
he
was
exceedingly
popular
in
the
school
but
still
there
were
people
who
thought
that
he
might
occasionally
draw
the
line
somewhere
watson
the
for
example
thought
so
when
pringle
primed
him
with
advice
on
the
subject
of
preparing
a
wicket
and
langdale
who
had
been
captain
of
the
team
five
years
before
had
thought
so
most
decidedly
and
had
not
hesitated
to
say
so
when
pringle
then
in
his
first
term
and
aged
twelve
had
stood
behind
the
first
eleven
net
and
requested
him
peremptorily
to
down
sir
keep
down
indeed
the
great
man
had
very
nearly
had
a
fit
on
that
occasion
and
was
wont
afterwards
to
attribute
to
the
effects
of
the
shock
so
received
a
sequence
of
three
which
befell
him
in
the
next
three
matches
in
short
in
every
department
of
life
pringle
advice
was
always
and
generally
unsought
at
everybody
disposal
to
round
the
position
off
neatly
it
would
be
necessary
to
picture
him
as
a
total
failure
in
the
practical
side
of
all
the
subjects
in
which
he
was
so
brilliant
a
theorist
strangely
enough
however
this
was
not
the
case
there
were
few
better
bats
in
the
school
than
pringle
norris
on
his
day
was
more
stylish
and
marriott
not
infrequently
made
more
runs
but
for
consistency
pringle
was
unrivalled
that
was
partly
the
reason
why
at
this
time
he
was
feeling
pleased
with
life
the
school
had
played
three
matches
up
to
date
and
had
won
them
all
in
the
first
an
oxford
college
team
containing
several
old
beckfordians
had
been
met
and
routed
pringle
contributing
to
a
total
of
three
hundred
odd
but
norris
had
made
a
century
which
had
rather
diverted
the
public
eye
from
this
performance
then
the
school
had
played
the
emeriti
and
had
won
again
quite
comfortably
this
time
his
score
had
been
useful
but
still
not
phenomenal
then
in
the
third
match
charchester
one
of
the
big
school
matches
of
the
season
he
had
found
himself
he
ran
up
a
hundred
and
without
a
chance
and
felt
that
life
had
little
more
to
offer
that
had
been
only
a
week
ago
and
the
glow
of
satisfaction
was
still
pleasantly
warm
it
was
while
he
was
gloating
silently
in
his
study
over
the
bat
with
which
a
grateful
field
sports
committee
had
presented
him
as
a
reward
for
this
feat
that
he
became
aware
that
lorimer
his
study
companion
appeared
to
be
in
an
entirely
different
frame
of
mind
to
his
own
lorimer
was
in
the
upper
fifth
pringle
in
the
remove
lorimer
sat
at
the
study
table
gnawing
a
pen
in
a
feverish
manner
that
told
of
an
overwrought
soul
twice
he
uttered
sounds
that
were
obviously
sounds
of
anguish
half
groans
and
half
grunts
pringle
laid
down
his
bat
and
decided
to
investigate
up
he
asked
bally
poem
thing
said
lorimer
oh
ah
i
know
pringle
had
been
in
the
upper
fifth
himself
a
year
before
and
he
remembered
that
every
summer
term
there
descended
upon
that
form
a
bad
time
in
the
shape
of
a
poetry
prize
a
certain
indian
potentate
the
rajah
of
seltzerpore
had
paid
a
visit
to
the
school
some
years
back
and
had
left
behind
him
on
his
departure
certain
monies
in
the
local
bank
which
were
to
be
devoted
to
providing
the
upper
fifth
with
an
annual
prize
for
the
best
poem
on
a
subject
to
be
selected
by
the
headmaster
entrance
was
compulsory
the
wily
authorities
knew
very
well
that
if
it
had
not
been
the
entries
for
the
prize
would
have
been
somewhat
small
why
the
upper
fifth
were
so
favoured
in
preference
to
the
sixth
or
remove
is
doubtful
possibly
it
was
felt
that
what
with
the
jones
history
the
smith
latin
verse
the
robinson
latin
prose
and
the
de
vere
crespigny
greek
verse
and
other
trophies
open
only
to
members
of
the
remove
and
sixth
those
two
forms
had
enough
to
keep
them
occupied
as
it
was
at
any
rate
to
the
upper
fifth
the
prize
was
given
and
every
year
three
weeks
after
the
commencement
of
the
summer
term
the
bad
time
arrived
you
get
on
asked
pringle
the
subject
of
dido
to
be
got
out
of
that
surely
you
tell
me
what
of
things
as
what
ca
see
anything
myself
i
call
it
perfectly
indecent
dragging
the
good
lady
out
of
her
tomb
at
this
time
of
day
i
looked
her
up
in
the
dic
of
antiquities
and
it
appears
that
she
committed
suicide
some
years
ago
i
call
it
what
do
i
want
to
know
about
her
hecuba
to
him
or
he
to
hecuba
murmured
pringle
said
lorimer
looking
puzzled
hecuba
got
to
do
with
it
was
only
quoting
said
pringle
with
gentle
superiority
i
wish
instead
of
quoting
rot
you
devote
your
energies
to
helping
me
with
these
beastly
verses
how
on
earth
shall
i
begin
might
adapt
my
quotation
what
dido
got
to
do
with
me
or
i
to
do
with
dido
i
rather
like
that
jam
it
down
then
you
go
on
in
a
sort
of
metre
in
the
coon
style
besides
you
see
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
you
administer
a
wholesome
snub
to
the
examiner
right
away
makes
him
sit
up
at
once
put
it
down
lorimer
bit
off
another
quarter
of
an
inch
of
his
pen
need
be
an
ass
he
said
shortly
dear
chap
said
pringle
enjoying
himself
immensely
on
earth
is
the
good
of
my
offering
you
suggestions
if
you
wo
take
them
lorimer
said
nothing
he
bit
off
another
mouthful
of
penholder
anyway
resumed
pringle
ca
see
why
you
so
keen
on
the
business
put
down
anything
the
beaks
never
make
a
fuss
about
these
special
exams
is
the
beaks
i
care
about
said
lorimer
in
an
injured
tone
of
voice
as
if
someone
had
been
insinuating
that
he
had
committed
some
crime
my
people
are
rather
keen
on
my
doing
well
in
this
exam
this
exam
particularly
i
do
know
my
grandfather
or
someone
was
a
bit
of
a
pro
at
verse
in
his
day
i
believe
and
they
think
it
ought
to
run
in
the
family
pringle
examined
the
situation
in
all
its
aspects
you
get
along
he
enquired
at
length
an
inch
i
wish
we
could
swop
places
do
i
for
some
things
to
start
with
i
should
mind
having
made
that
century
of
yours
against
charchester
pringle
beamed
the
least
hint
that
his
was
taking
him
at
his
own
valuation
always
made
him
happy
he
said
but
what
i
meant
was
that
i
wished
i
was
in
for
this
poetry
prize
i
bet
i
could
turn
out
a
rattling
good
screed
why
last
year
i
almost
got
the
prize
i
sent
in
fearfully
hot
stuff
so
said
lorimer
doubtfully
in
answer
to
the
good
screed
passage
of
pringle
speech
i
wish
you
have
a
shot
you
might
as
well
really
how
about
the
prize
hang
the
prize
we
have
to
chance
that
thought
you
were
keen
on
getting
it
no
second
or
third
will
do
me
all
right
and
satisfy
my
people
they
only
want
to
know
for
certain
that
i
got
the
poetic
afflatus
all
right
will
you
take
it
on
right
awfully
say
lorimer
said
pringle
after
a
pause
your
people
coming
down
for
the
match
the
old
beckfordians
match
was
the
great
function
of
the
beckford
cricket
season
the
headmaster
gave
a
the
school
band
played
the
school
choir
sang
and
sisters
cousins
aunts
and
parents
flocked
to
the
school
in
platoons
i
think
so
said
lorimer
your
sister
coming
i
do
know
a
brother
utter
lack
of
interest
in
his
actions
is
a
weird
and
wonderful
thing
for
an
outsider
to
behold
look
here
i
wish
you
get
her
to
come
we
could
give
them
tea
in
here
and
have
rather
a
good
time
do
you
think
right
i
make
her
come
look
here
pringle
i
believe
rather
gone
on
mabel
this
was
lorimer
vulgar
way
be
an
ass
said
pringle
with
a
laugh
which
should
have
been
careless
but
was
in
reality
merely
feeble
quite
a
kid
miss
mabel
lorimer
exact
age
was
fifteen
she
had
brown
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
smile
which
disclosed
to
view
a
dimple
there
are
worse
things
than
a
dimple
distinctly
so
indeed
when
ladies
of
fifteen
possess
dimples
mere
man
becomes
but
as
a
piece
of
damp
pringle
was
seventeen
and
a
half
and
consequently
too
old
to
take
note
of
such
frivolous
attributes
but
all
the
same
he
had
a
sort
of
vague
sketchy
impression
that
it
would
be
pleasanter
to
run
up
a
lively
century
against
the
with
miss
lorimer
as
a
spectator
than
in
her
absence
he
felt
pleased
that
she
was
coming
say
about
this
poem
said
lorimer
dismissing
a
subject
which
manifestly
bored
him
and
returning
to
one
which
was
of
vital
interest
sure
you
can
write
fairly
decent
stuff
it
no
good
sending
in
stuff
that
turn
the
examiner
hair
grey
can
you
turn
out
something
really
decent
pringle
said
nothing
he
smiled
gently
as
who
should
observe
and
shakespeare
farnie
gets
into
trouble
it
was
perhaps
only
natural
that
farnie
having
been
warned
so
strongly
of
the
inadvisability
of
having
anything
to
do
with
monk
should
for
that
very
reason
be
attracted
to
him
nobody
ever
wants
to
do
anything
except
what
they
are
not
allowed
to
do
otherwise
there
is
no
explaining
the
friendship
that
arose
between
them
jack
monk
was
not
an
attractive
individual
he
had
a
slack
mouth
and
a
shifty
eye
and
his
complexion
was
the
sort
which
friends
would
have
described
as
olive
enemies
with
more
truth
as
dirty
green
these
defects
would
have
mattered
little
of
course
in
themselves
there
many
a
bilious
countenance
so
to
speak
covers
a
warm
heart
with
monk
however
appearances
were
not
deceptive
he
looked
a
bad
lot
and
he
was
one
it
was
on
the
second
morning
of
term
that
the
acquaintanceship
began
monk
was
coming
downstairs
from
his
study
with
danvers
and
farnie
was
leaving
the
fags
that
kid
said
danvers
the
chap
i
was
telling
you
about
gethryn
uncle
you
know
really
let
cultivate
him
i
say
old
chap
do
walk
so
fast
farnie
rightly
concluding
that
the
remark
was
addressed
to
him
turned
and
waited
and
the
three
strolled
over
to
the
school
buildings
together
they
would
have
made
an
interesting
study
for
the
observer
of
human
nature
the
two
seniors
fancying
that
they
had
to
deal
with
a
small
boy
just
arrived
at
his
first
school
and
in
the
grip
of
that
strange
lost
feeling
which
attacks
the
best
of
new
boys
for
a
day
or
so
after
their
arrival
and
farnie
on
the
other
hand
watching
every
move
as
perfectly
composed
and
at
home
as
a
youth
should
be
with
the
experience
of
three
public
schools
to
back
him
up
when
they
arrived
at
the
school
gates
monk
and
danvers
turned
to
go
in
the
direction
of
their
the
remove
leaving
farnie
at
the
door
of
the
upper
fourth
at
this
point
a
small
comedy
took
place
monk
after
feeling
hastily
in
his
pockets
requested
danvers
to
lend
him
five
shillings
until
next
saturday
danvers
knew
this
request
of
old
and
he
knew
the
answer
that
was
expected
of
him
by
replying
that
he
was
sorry
but
he
had
not
got
the
money
he
gave
farnie
who
was
still
standing
at
the
door
his
cue
to
offer
to
supply
the
deficiency
most
new
boys
they
had
grasped
this
fact
from
experience
would
have
felt
it
an
honour
to
oblige
a
senior
with
a
small
loan
as
farnie
made
no
signs
of
doing
what
was
expected
of
him
monk
was
obliged
to
resort
to
the
somewhat
cruder
course
of
applying
for
the
loan
in
person
he
applied
farnie
with
the
utmost
willingness
brought
to
light
a
handful
of
money
mostly
gold
monk
eye
gleamed
approval
and
he
stretched
forth
an
itching
palm
danvers
began
to
think
that
it
would
be
rash
to
let
a
chance
like
this
slip
ordinarily
the
tacit
agreement
between
the
pair
was
that
only
one
should
borrow
at
a
time
lest
confidence
should
be
destroyed
in
the
victim
but
here
was
surely
an
exception
a
special
case
with
a
young
gentleman
so
obviously
a
man
of
coin
as
farnie
the
rule
might
well
be
broken
for
once
you
about
it
farnie
old
man
he
said
carelessly
might
let
me
have
a
bob
or
two
if
you
do
mind
five
bob
see
me
through
to
saturday
all
right
you
mean
tomorrow
enquired
farnie
looking
up
from
his
heap
of
gold
saturday
week
let
you
have
it
back
by
then
at
the
latest
make
a
point
of
it
would
a
quid
do
said
danvers
ecstatically
here
assented
monk
that
all
right
said
farnie
briskly
thought
perhaps
you
might
have
had
enough
you
got
a
quid
i
know
monk
because
i
saw
you
haul
one
out
at
breakfast
and
danvers
has
got
one
too
because
he
offered
to
toss
you
for
it
in
the
study
afterwards
and
besides
i
could
lend
you
anything
in
any
case
because
i
only
got
about
fourteen
quid
myself
with
which
parting
shot
he
retired
wrapped
in
gentle
thought
into
his
and
from
the
noise
which
ensued
immediately
upon
his
arrival
the
shrewd
listener
would
have
deduced
quite
correctly
that
he
had
organized
and
taken
the
leading
part
in
a
general
rag
monk
and
danvers
proceeded
upon
their
way
got
rather
left
there
old
chap
said
monk
at
length
like
that
replied
the
outraged
danvers
about
you
then
it
seemed
to
me
you
got
rather
left
too
monk
compromised
anyhow
he
said
sha
get
much
out
of
that
kid
beast
said
danvers
complainingly
and
they
went
on
into
their
in
silence
saw
your
young
er
relative
in
earnest
conversation
with
friend
monk
this
morning
said
marriott
later
on
in
the
day
to
gethryn
thought
you
were
going
to
give
him
the
tip
in
that
direction
i
did
said
the
bishop
wearily
i
ca
always
be
looking
after
the
little
brute
he
only
does
it
out
of
sheer
cussedness
because
i
told
him
not
to
it
stands
to
reason
that
he
monk
remind
me
of
the
psalmist
and
the
wicked
man
surname
unknown
said
marriott
see
the
good
side
of
monk
is
one
he
only
got
two
sides
a
bad
side
and
a
worse
side
which
he
sticks
on
on
the
strength
of
being
fairly
good
at
games
i
wonder
if
he
going
to
get
his
first
this
season
he
not
a
bad
bat
do
think
he
will
he
is
a
good
bat
but
there
are
heaps
better
in
the
place
i
say
i
think
i
shall
give
young
farnie
the
tip
once
more
and
let
him
take
it
or
leave
it
what
do
you
think
leave
it
said
marriott
with
conviction
nor
was
he
mistaken
farnie
listened
with
enthusiasm
to
his
second
excursus
on
the
monk
topic
and
though
he
said
nothing
was
apparently
convinced
on
the
following
afternoon
monk
danvers
waterford
and
he
hired
a
boat
and
went
up
the
river
together
gethryn
and
marriott
steered
by
wilson
who
was
rapidly
developing
into
a
useful
coxswain
got
an
excellent
view
of
them
moored
under
the
shade
of
a
willow
drinking
and
apparently
on
the
best
of
terms
with
one
another
and
the
world
in
general
in
a
brief
but
moving
speech
the
bishop
finally
excommunicated
his
erring
relative
all
i
care
he
concluded
can
do
what
he
likes
in
future
i
sha
stop
him
said
marriott
do
think
you
will
for
the
first
month
of
his
school
life
farnie
behaved
except
in
his
choice
of
companions
much
like
an
ordinary
junior
he
played
cricket
moderately
well
did
his
share
of
compulsory
fielding
at
the
first
eleven
net
and
went
for
frequent
river
excursions
with
monk
danvers
and
the
rest
of
the
mob
at
first
the
other
juniors
of
the
house
were
inclined
to
resent
this
extending
of
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
to
owners
of
studies
and
second
eleven
men
and
attempted
to
make
farnie
see
the
sin
and
folly
of
his
ways
but
nature
had
endowed
that
youth
with
a
fund
of
vitriolic
repartee
when
millett
one
of
leicester
juniors
evolved
some
laborious
sarcasm
on
the
subject
of
farnie
swell
friends
farnie
in
a
series
of
three
remarks
reduced
him
figuratively
speaking
to
a
small
and
palpitating
spot
of
grease
after
that
his
actions
came
in
for
no
further
or
at
any
rate
no
outspoken
comment
given
sixpence
a
week
and
no
more
farnie
might
have
survived
an
entire
term
without
breaking
any
serious
school
rule
but
when
after
buying
a
bicycle
from
smith
of
markham
he
found
himself
with
eight
pounds
to
his
name
in
solid
cash
and
the
means
of
getting
far
enough
away
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
school
to
be
able
to
spend
it
much
as
he
liked
he
began
to
do
strange
and
risky
things
in
his
spare
time
the
great
obstacle
to
illicit
enjoyment
at
beckford
was
the
four
on
there
were
other
obstacles
such
as
games
and
so
forth
but
these
could
be
avoided
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
judgement
the
penalty
for
at
a
game
was
a
fine
of
sixpence
constant
absence
was
likely
in
time
to
lead
to
a
more
or
less
thrilling
interview
with
the
captain
of
cricket
but
a
very
occasional
attendance
was
enough
to
stave
off
this
disaster
and
as
for
the
sixpence
to
a
man
of
means
like
farnie
it
was
a
mere
nothing
it
was
a
bad
system
and
it
was
a
wonder
under
the
circumstances
how
beckford
produced
the
elevens
it
did
but
it
was
the
system
and
farnie
availed
himself
of
it
to
the
full
the
obstacle
of
he
managed
also
to
surmount
some
reckless
and
penniless
friend
was
generally
willing
for
a
consideration
to
answer
his
name
for
him
and
so
most
saturday
afternoons
would
find
farnie
leaving
behind
him
the
flannelled
fools
at
their
various
wickets
and
speeding
out
into
the
country
on
his
bicycle
in
the
direction
of
the
village
of
biddlehampton
where
mine
host
of
the
and
cornflower
in
addition
to
other
refreshment
for
man
and
beast
advertised
that
and
billiards
might
be
played
on
the
premises
it
was
not
the
former
of
these
games
that
attracted
farnie
he
was
no
pinger
nor
was
he
a
pongster
but
for
billiards
he
had
a
decided
taste
a
genuine
taste
not
the
affectation
sometimes
displayed
by
boys
of
his
age
considering
his
age
he
was
a
remarkable
player
later
on
in
life
it
appeared
likely
that
he
would
have
the
choice
of
three
professions
open
to
him
namely
professional
billiard
player
billiard
marker
and
billiard
sharp
at
each
of
the
three
he
showed
distinct
promise
he
was
not
to
the
green
cloth
by
monk
or
danvers
indeed
if
there
had
been
any
luring
to
be
done
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
done
it
and
not
they
neither
monk
nor
danvers
was
in
his
confidence
in
the
matter
billiards
is
not
a
cheap
amusement
by
the
end
of
his
sixth
week
farnie
was
reduced
to
a
single
pound
a
sum
which
for
one
of
his
tastes
was
practically
poverty
and
just
at
the
moment
when
he
was
least
able
to
bear
up
against
it
fate
dealt
him
one
of
its
nastiest
blows
he
was
playing
a
fifty
up
against
a
friendly
but
unskilful
farmer
at
the
and
cornflower
look
out
he
said
as
his
opponent
effected
a
somewhat
rustic
stroke
be
cutting
the
cloth
in
a
second
the
farmer
grunted
missed
by
inches
and
retired
leaving
the
red
ball
in
the
jaws
of
the
pocket
and
farnie
with
three
to
make
to
win
it
was
an
absurdly
easy
stroke
and
the
bishop
uncle
took
it
with
an
absurd
amount
of
conceit
and
carelessness
hardly
troubling
to
aim
he
struck
his
ball
the
cue
slid
off
in
one
direction
the
ball
rolled
sluggishly
in
another
and
when
the
cue
had
finished
its
run
the
smooth
green
surface
of
the
table
was
marred
by
a
jagged
and
unsightly
cut
there
was
another
young
man
gone
wrong
to
say
that
the
farmer
laughed
would
be
to
express
the
matter
feebly
that
his
young
opponent
who
had
been
irritating
him
unspeakably
since
the
beginning
of
the
game
with
advice
and
criticism
should
have
done
exactly
what
he
had
cautioned
him
the
farmer
against
a
moment
before
struck
him
as
being
the
finest
example
of
poetic
justice
he
had
ever
heard
of
and
he
signalized
his
appreciation
of
the
same
by
nearly
dying
of
apoplexy
the
marker
expressed
an
opinion
that
farnie
had
been
and
gone
and
done
it
he
said
inserting
a
finger
in
the
cut
to
display
its
dimensions
this
mean
a
noo
cloth
young
feller
me
lad
that
wot
this
mean
that
be
three
pound
we
will
trouble
you
for
if
please
farnie
produced
his
sole
remaining
sovereign
i
got
he
said
leave
my
name
and
address
you
trouble
young
feller
me
lad
said
the
marker
who
appeared
to
be
a
very
aggressive
and
unpleasant
sort
of
character
altogether
with
meaning
know
yer
name
and
i
knows
yer
address
today
fortnight
at
the
very
latest
if
please
you
do
want
me
to
to
go
to
your
master
about
it
now
do
yer
what
say
no
ve
well
then
today
fortnight
is
the
time
and
you
remember
it
what
was
left
of
farnie
then
rode
slowly
back
to
beckford
why
he
went
to
monk
on
his
return
probably
he
could
not
have
explained
himself
but
he
did
go
and
having
told
his
story
in
full
wound
up
by
asking
for
a
loan
of
two
pounds
monk
first
impulse
was
to
refer
him
back
to
a
previous
interview
when
matters
had
been
the
other
way
about
that
small
affair
of
the
pound
on
the
second
morning
of
the
term
then
there
flashed
across
his
mind
certain
reasons
against
this
move
at
present
farnie
attitude
towards
him
was
unpleasantly
independent
he
made
him
understand
that
he
went
about
with
him
from
choice
and
that
there
was
to
be
nothing
of
the
patron
and
dependant
about
their
alliance
if
he
were
to
lend
him
the
two
pounds
now
things
would
alter
and
to
have
got
a
complete
hold
over
master
reginald
farnie
monk
would
have
paid
more
than
two
pounds
farnie
had
the
intelligence
to
carry
through
anything
however
risky
and
there
were
many
things
which
monk
would
have
liked
to
do
but
owing
to
the
risks
involved
shirked
doing
for
himself
besides
he
happened
to
be
in
funds
just
now
look
here
old
chap
he
said
have
strict
business
between
friends
if
you
pay
me
back
four
quid
at
the
end
of
term
you
shall
have
the
two
pounds
how
does
that
strike
you
it
struck
farnie
as
it
would
have
struck
most
people
that
if
this
was
monk
idea
of
strict
business
there
were
the
makings
of
no
ordinary
financier
in
him
but
to
get
his
two
pounds
he
would
have
agreed
to
anything
and
the
end
of
term
seemed
a
long
way
off
the
awkward
part
of
the
episode
was
that
the
punishment
for
it
if
detected
was
not
expulsion
but
flogging
and
farnie
resembled
the
lady
in
ingoldsby
who
mind
death
but
who
could
stand
pinching
he
did
mind
expulsion
he
was
used
to
it
but
he
could
stand
flogging
be
all
right
he
said
and
the
money
changed
hands
and
stays
there
say
said
baker
of
jephson
excitedly
some
days
later
reeling
into
the
study
which
he
shared
with
norris
you
seen
the
team
the
bringing
down
at
nearly
every
school
there
is
a
type
of
youth
who
asks
this
question
on
the
morning
of
the
match
norris
was
engaged
in
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
pair
of
cricket
boots
hullo
where
did
you
raise
that
sporter
let
have
a
look
but
baker
proposed
to
conduct
this
business
in
person
it
is
ten
times
more
pleasant
to
administer
a
series
of
shocks
to
a
friend
than
to
sit
by
and
watch
him
administering
them
to
himself
he
retained
and
began
to
read
out
the
team
middlesex
had
a
match
said
norris
as
baker
paused
dramatically
to
let
the
name
of
a
professional
sink
in
they
do
play
surrey
till
monday
if
they
got
an
important
match
like
surrey
on
on
monday
said
norris
disgustedly
on
earth
do
they
let
their
best
man
come
down
here
today
for
and
fag
himself
out
baker
suggested
gently
that
if
anybody
was
going
to
be
fagged
out
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
would
in
all
probability
be
the
beckford
bowlers
and
not
a
man
who
as
he
was
careful
to
point
out
had
run
up
a
century
a
mere
three
days
ago
against
yorkshire
and
who
was
apparently
at
that
moment
at
the
very
top
of
his
form
said
norris
might
crock
himself
or
anything
rank
bad
policy
i
call
it
anybody
else
baker
resumed
his
reading
a
string
of
unknowns
ended
in
another
celebrity
said
norris
t
blackwell
says
but
went
on
baker
brightening
up
again
always
get
the
initials
wrong
in
the
papers
certain
to
be
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
saw
that
he
made
against
notts
the
other
day
norris
tried
to
comfort
himself
by
observing
that
notts
could
bowl
for
toffee
week
too
said
baker
made
a
hundred
and
not
out
against
malvern
for
the
gentlemen
of
warwickshire
they
could
get
him
out
he
concluded
with
unction
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
himself
was
playing
in
the
match
today
and
might
under
the
circumstances
reasonably
look
forward
to
a
considerable
dose
of
the
task
of
announcing
the
bad
news
to
norris
appeared
to
have
a
most
elevating
effect
on
his
spirits
nothing
extra
special
said
norris
in
answer
to
the
last
item
of
information
malvern
wicket
like
a
wickets
are
bad
either
at
this
time
of
year
said
baker
i
heard
rumours
that
they
had
got
a
record
one
ready
for
this
match
seems
to
me
said
norris
what
i
better
do
if
we
want
to
bat
at
all
today
is
to
win
the
toss
though
sammy
and
the
bishop
and
baynes
ought
to
be
able
to
get
any
ordinary
side
out
all
right
this
is
an
ordinary
side
it
a
sort
of
improved
county
team
got
about
four
men
who
might
come
off
but
the
sometimes
have
a
bit
of
a
tail
we
ought
to
have
a
look
in
if
we
win
the
toss
so
said
baker
doubt
it
though
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
the
school
always
went
out
in
a
body
to
inspect
the
pitch
after
the
wicket
had
been
described
by
experts
in
hushed
whispers
as
looking
pretty
good
the
bell
rang
and
all
who
were
not
playing
for
the
team
with
the
exception
of
the
lucky
individual
who
had
obtained
for
himself
the
post
of
scorer
strolled
back
towards
the
blocks
monk
had
come
out
with
waterford
but
seeing
farnie
ahead
and
walking
alone
he
quitted
waterford
and
attached
himself
to
the
genial
reginald
he
wanted
to
talk
business
he
had
not
found
the
speculation
of
the
two
pounds
a
very
profitable
one
he
had
advanced
the
money
under
the
impression
that
farnie
by
accepting
it
was
practically
selling
his
independence
and
there
were
certain
matters
in
which
monk
was
largely
interested
connected
with
the
breaking
of
bounds
and
the
purchase
of
contraband
goods
which
he
would
have
been
exceedingly
glad
to
have
performed
by
deputy
he
had
fancied
that
farnie
would
have
taken
over
these
jobs
as
part
of
his
debt
but
he
had
mistaken
his
man
on
the
very
first
occasion
when
he
had
attempted
to
put
on
the
screw
farnie
had
flatly
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
what
he
proposed
he
said
that
he
was
not
monk
fag
a
remark
which
had
the
merit
of
being
absolutely
true
all
this
combined
with
a
slight
sinking
of
his
own
funds
induced
monk
to
take
steps
towards
recovering
the
loan
say
farnie
old
chap
say
do
you
remember
my
lending
you
two
quid
some
time
ago
do
give
me
much
chance
of
forgetting
it
said
farnie
monk
smiled
he
could
afford
to
be
generous
towards
such
witticisms
want
it
back
he
said
right
you
get
it
at
the
end
of
term
want
it
now
hard
up
old
chap
are
said
farnie
got
three
pounds
twelve
and
sixpence
if
you
will
keep
counting
your
money
in
public
you
blame
a
chap
for
knowing
how
much
you
got
monk
slightly
disconcerted
changed
his
plan
of
action
he
abandoned
skirmishing
tactics
mind
that
he
said
point
is
that
i
want
that
four
pounds
i
going
to
have
it
too
know
at
the
end
of
term
going
to
have
it
now
can
have
a
pound
of
it
now
enough
do
see
how
you
expect
me
to
raise
any
more
if
i
could
do
you
think
i
should
have
borrowed
it
you
might
chuck
rotting
for
a
change
look
here
old
chap
said
monk
should
think
you
rather
raise
that
tin
somehow
than
have
it
get
about
that
you
been
playing
pills
at
some
pub
out
of
bounds
what
farnie
for
one
of
the
few
occasions
on
record
was
shaken
out
of
his
usual
even
in
his
easy
code
of
morality
there
had
always
been
one
crime
which
was
an
anathema
the
sort
of
thing
no
fellow
could
think
of
doing
but
it
was
obviously
at
this
that
monk
was
hinting
lord
man
he
cried
do
mean
to
say
you
thinking
of
sneaking
why
the
fellows
would
boot
you
round
the
field
you
stay
in
the
place
a
week
are
heaps
of
ways
said
monk
which
a
thing
can
get
about
without
anyone
actually
telling
the
beaks
at
present
i
not
told
a
soul
but
you
know
if
i
let
it
out
to
anyone
they
might
tell
someone
else
and
so
on
and
if
everybody
knows
a
thing
the
beaks
generally
get
hold
of
it
sooner
or
later
you
much
better
let
me
have
that
four
quid
old
chap
farnie
capitulated
right
he
said
get
it
somehow
awfully
old
chap
said
monk
long
in
all
beckford
there
was
only
one
person
who
was
in
the
least
degree
likely
to
combine
the
two
qualities
necessary
for
the
extraction
of
farnie
from
his
difficulties
these
qualities
were
in
the
first
place
ability
in
the
second
place
willingness
to
advance
him
free
of
security
the
four
pounds
he
required
the
person
whom
he
had
in
his
mind
was
gethryn
he
had
reasoned
the
matter
out
step
by
step
during
the
second
half
of
morning
school
gethryn
though
he
had
as
farnie
knew
no
overwhelming
amount
of
affection
for
his
uncle
might
in
a
case
of
great
need
prove
blood
to
be
thicker
as
per
advertisement
than
water
but
he
reflected
he
must
represent
himself
as
in
danger
of
expulsion
rather
than
flogging
he
had
an
uneasy
idea
that
if
the
bishop
were
to
discover
that
all
he
stood
to
get
was
a
flogging
he
would
remark
with
enthusiasm
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
good
work
might
go
on
expulsion
was
different
to
save
a
member
of
his
family
from
expulsion
he
might
think
it
worth
while
to
pass
round
the
hat
amongst
his
wealthy
acquaintances
if
four
plutocrats
with
four
sovereigns
were
to
combine
farnie
by
their
united
efforts
would
be
saved
and
he
rather
liked
the
notion
of
being
turned
into
a
sort
of
limited
liability
company
like
the
duke
of
plaza
toro
at
a
pound
a
share
it
seemed
to
add
a
certain
dignity
to
his
position
to
gethryn
study
therefore
he
went
directly
school
was
over
if
he
had
reflected
he
might
have
known
that
he
would
not
have
been
there
while
the
match
was
going
on
but
his
brain
fatigued
with
his
recent
calculations
had
not
noted
this
point
the
study
was
empty
most
people
on
finding
themselves
in
a
strange
and
empty
room
are
seized
with
a
desire
to
explore
the
same
and
observe
from
internal
evidence
what
manner
of
man
is
the
owner
nowhere
does
character
come
out
so
clearly
as
in
the
decoration
of
one
private
den
many
a
man
at
present
respected
by
his
associates
would
stand
forth
unmasked
at
his
true
worth
could
the
world
but
look
into
his
room
for
there
they
would
see
that
he
was
so
lost
to
every
sense
of
shame
as
to
cover
his
books
with
brown
paper
or
deck
his
walls
with
oleographs
presented
with
the
christmas
numbers
both
of
which
habits
argue
a
frame
of
mind
fit
for
murderers
stratagems
and
spoils
let
no
such
man
be
trusted
the
bishop
study
which
farnie
now
proceeded
to
inspect
was
not
of
this
kind
it
was
a
neat
study
arranged
with
not
a
little
taste
there
were
photographs
of
teams
with
the
college
arms
on
their
plain
oak
frames
and
photographs
of
relations
in
frames
which
tried
to
look
and
for
the
most
part
succeeded
in
looking
as
if
they
had
not
cost
fourpence
three
farthings
at
a
christmas
bargain
sale
there
were
of
various
moving
incidents
in
the
careers
of
the
bishop
and
his
friends
marriott
for
example
as
he
appeared
when
carried
to
the
pavilion
after
that
sensational
century
against
the
authentics
robertson
of
blaker
winning
the
quarter
mile
john
brown
predecessor
in
the
captaincy
and
one
of
the
four
best
batsmen
beckford
had
ever
had
batting
at
the
nets
norris
taking
a
skier
on
the
boundary
in
last
year
match
the
bishop
himself
going
out
to
bat
in
the
charchester
match
and
many
more
of
the
same
sort
all
these
farnie
observed
with
considerable
interest
but
as
he
moved
towards
the
his
eye
was
caught
by
an
object
more
interesting
still
it
was
a
simple
and
unornamental
but
undoubtedly
a
and
as
he
took
it
up
it
rattled
the
key
was
in
the
lock
in
a
boarding
house
at
a
public
school
it
is
not
as
a
general
rule
absolutely
necessary
to
keep
one
valuables
always
hermetically
sealed
the
difference
between
and
is
so
very
rarely
confused
by
the
occupants
of
such
an
establishment
that
one
is
apt
to
grow
careless
and
every
now
and
then
accidents
happen
an
accident
was
about
to
happen
now
it
was
at
first
without
any
motive
except
curiosity
that
farnie
opened
the
he
merely
wished
to
see
how
much
there
was
inside
with
a
view
to
ascertaining
what
his
prospects
of
negotiating
a
loan
with
his
relative
were
likely
to
be
when
however
he
did
see
other
feelings
began
to
take
the
place
of
curiosity
he
counted
the
money
there
were
ten
sovereigns
one
and
a
good
deal
of
silver
one
of
the
institutions
at
beckford
was
a
mission
the
school
by
more
or
less
voluntary
contributions
supported
a
species
of
home
somewhere
in
the
wilds
of
kennington
no
one
knew
exactly
what
or
where
this
home
was
but
all
paid
their
subscriptions
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
term
and
tried
to
forget
about
it
gethryn
collected
not
only
for
leicester
house
but
also
for
the
sixth
form
and
was
consequently
if
only
by
proxy
a
man
of
large
means
large
farnie
thought
surely
four
pounds
to
be
paid
back
probably
almost
at
once
would
not
be
missed
why
should
he
farnie
spun
round
wilson
was
standing
in
the
doorway
farnie
said
he
are
you
playing
at
in
here
are
you
retorted
farnie
politely
to
fetch
a
book
marriott
said
i
might
what
are
you
up
to
shut
up
said
farnie
should
i
come
here
if
i
like
matter
of
fact
i
came
to
see
gethryn
is
here
said
wilson
luminously
do
mean
to
say
you
noticed
that
already
you
got
an
eye
like
a
hawk
wilson
i
was
just
taking
a
look
round
if
you
really
want
to
know
i
should
advise
you
to
let
marriott
catch
you
mucking
his
study
up
seen
a
book
called
the
red
oh
here
it
is
coming
over
to
the
field
just
yet
i
want
to
have
another
look
round
do
you
wait
though
all
right
and
wilson
retired
with
his
book
now
though
wilson
at
present
suspected
nothing
not
knowing
of
the
existence
of
the
farnie
felt
that
when
the
money
came
to
be
missed
and
inquiries
were
made
as
to
who
had
been
in
the
study
and
when
he
would
recall
the
interview
two
courses
therefore
remained
open
to
him
he
could
leave
the
money
altogether
or
he
could
take
it
and
leave
himself
in
other
words
run
away
in
the
first
case
there
would
of
course
remain
the
chance
that
he
might
induce
gethryn
to
lend
him
the
four
pounds
but
this
had
never
been
more
than
a
forlorn
hope
and
in
the
light
of
the
possibilities
opened
out
by
the
he
thought
no
more
of
it
the
real
problem
was
should
he
or
should
he
not
take
the
money
from
the
as
he
hesitated
the
recollection
of
monk
veiled
threats
came
back
to
him
and
he
wavered
no
longer
he
opened
the
box
again
took
out
the
contents
and
dropped
them
into
his
pocket
while
he
was
about
it
he
thought
he
might
as
well
take
all
as
only
a
part
then
he
wrote
two
notes
one
to
the
bishop
he
placed
on
top
of
the
the
other
he
placed
with
four
sovereigns
on
the
table
in
monk
study
finally
he
left
the
room
shut
the
door
carefully
behind
him
and
went
to
the
yard
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
he
kept
his
bicycle
the
workings
of
the
human
mind
and
especially
of
the
young
human
mind
are
peculiar
it
never
occurred
to
farnie
that
a
result
equally
profitable
to
himself
and
decidedly
more
convenient
for
all
concerned
with
the
possible
exception
of
monk
might
have
been
arrived
at
if
he
had
simply
left
the
money
in
the
box
and
run
away
without
it
however
as
the
poet
says
you
ca
think
of
everything
the
bishop
goes
for
a
ride
the
match
opened
auspiciously
norris
for
the
first
time
that
season
won
the
toss
tom
brown
we
read
in
a
similar
position
the
usual
liberality
of
young
hands
put
his
opponents
in
first
norris
was
not
so
liberal
he
may
have
been
young
but
he
was
not
so
young
as
that
the
sun
was
shining
on
as
true
a
wicket
as
was
ever
prepared
when
he
cried
and
the
coin
after
rolling
for
some
time
in
diminishing
circles
came
to
a
standstill
with
the
dragon
undermost
and
norris
returned
to
the
pavilion
and
informed
his
gratified
team
that
all
things
considered
he
rather
thought
that
they
would
bat
and
he
would
be
obliged
if
baker
would
get
on
his
pads
and
come
in
first
with
him
the
men
took
the
field
blackwell
by
the
way
had
shrunk
into
a
mere
brother
of
the
and
the
two
school
house
representatives
followed
them
an
amateur
of
lengthy
frame
took
the
ball
a
man
of
pace
to
judge
from
the
number
of
slips
norris
asked
for
leg
an
obliging
umpire
informed
him
that
he
had
got
two
leg
the
long
bowler
requested
short
slip
to
stand
finer
swung
his
arm
as
if
to
see
that
the
machinery
still
worked
and
dashed
wildly
towards
the
crease
the
match
had
begun
there
are
few
pleasanter
or
more
thrilling
moments
in
one
school
career
than
the
first
over
of
a
big
match
pleasant
that
is
to
say
if
you
are
actually
looking
on
to
have
to
listen
to
a
match
being
started
from
the
interior
of
a
is
of
course
maddening
you
hear
the
sound
of
bat
meeting
ball
followed
by
distant
clapping
somebody
has
scored
but
who
and
what
it
may
be
a
four
or
it
may
be
a
mere
single
more
important
still
it
may
be
the
other
side
batting
after
all
some
miscreant
has
possibly
lifted
your
best
bowler
into
the
road
the
suspense
is
awful
it
ought
to
be
a
school
rule
that
the
captain
of
the
team
should
send
a
message
round
the
stating
briefly
and
lucidly
the
result
of
the
toss
then
one
would
know
where
one
was
as
it
is
the
entire
form
is
dependent
on
the
man
sitting
under
the
window
the
turns
to
write
on
the
blackboard
the
only
hope
of
the
form
shoots
up
like
a
rocket
gazes
earnestly
in
the
direction
of
the
pavilion
and
falls
back
with
a
thud
into
his
seat
have
started
yet
he
informs
the
rest
in
a
stage
whisper
says
the
and
the
whole
business
must
be
gone
through
again
with
the
added
disadvantage
that
the
master
now
has
his
eye
fixed
coldly
on
the
individual
nearest
the
window
your
only
link
with
the
outer
world
various
masters
have
various
methods
under
such
circumstances
one
more
than
excellent
man
used
to
close
his
book
and
remark
think
make
up
a
little
party
to
watch
this
match
and
the
form
gasping
its
thanks
crowded
to
the
windows
another
the
exact
antithesis
of
this
great
and
good
gentleman
on
seeing
a
boy
taking
fitful
glances
through
the
window
would
observe
acidly
are
at
perfect
liberty
jones
to
watch
the
match
if
you
care
to
but
if
you
do
you
will
come
in
in
the
afternoon
and
make
up
the
time
you
waste
and
as
all
that
could
be
seen
from
that
particular
window
was
one
of
the
umpires
and
a
couple
of
fieldsmen
jones
would
reluctantly
elect
to
reserve
himself
and
for
the
present
to
turn
his
attention
to
euripides
again
if
you
are
one
of
the
team
and
watch
the
match
from
the
pavilion
you
escape
these
trials
but
there
are
others
in
the
first
few
overs
of
a
school
match
every
ball
looks
to
the
spectators
like
taking
a
wicket
the
fiendish
ingenuity
of
the
slow
bowler
and
the
lightning
speed
of
the
fast
man
at
the
other
end
make
one
feel
positively
ill
when
the
first
ten
has
gone
up
on
the
matters
begin
to
right
themselves
today
ten
went
up
quickly
the
fast
man
first
ball
was
outside
the
and
a
and
norris
whatever
the
state
of
his
nerves
at
the
time
never
forgot
his
forward
drive
before
the
bowler
had
recovered
his
balance
the
ball
was
to
the
ropes
the
umpire
waved
a
large
hand
towards
the
pavilion
the
bowler
looked
annoyed
and
the
school
inside
the
asked
itself
feverishly
what
had
happened
and
which
side
it
was
that
was
applauding
having
bowled
his
first
ball
too
far
up
the
man
on
the
principle
of
anything
for
a
change
now
put
in
a
very
short
one
norris
a
new
man
after
that
drive
steered
it
through
the
slips
and
again
the
umpire
waved
his
hand
the
rest
of
the
over
was
more
quiet
the
last
ball
went
for
four
byes
and
then
it
was
baker
turn
to
face
the
slow
man
baker
was
a
steady
plodding
bat
he
played
five
balls
gently
to
and
glanced
the
sixth
for
a
single
to
leg
with
the
fast
bowler
who
had
not
yet
got
his
length
he
was
more
vigorous
and
succeeded
in
cutting
him
twice
for
two
with
thirty
up
for
no
wickets
the
school
began
to
feel
more
comfortable
but
at
baker
was
shattered
by
the
man
of
pace
and
retired
with
twenty
to
his
credit
gethryn
came
in
next
but
it
was
not
to
be
his
day
out
with
the
bat
the
fast
bowler
who
was
now
bowling
excellently
sent
down
one
rather
wide
of
the
the
bishop
made
most
of
his
runs
from
off
balls
and
he
had
a
go
at
this
one
it
was
rising
when
he
hit
it
and
it
went
off
his
bat
like
a
flash
in
a
school
match
it
would
have
been
a
boundary
but
today
there
was
unusual
talent
in
the
slips
the
man
from
middlesex
darted
forward
and
sideways
he
took
the
ball
two
inches
from
the
ground
and
received
the
applause
which
followed
the
effort
with
a
rather
bored
look
as
if
he
were
saying
good
sirs
make
a
fuss
over
these
trifles
the
bishop
walked
slowly
back
to
the
pavilion
feeling
that
his
luck
was
out
and
pringle
came
in
a
boy
of
pringle
character
is
exactly
the
right
person
to
go
in
in
an
emergency
like
the
present
one
two
wickets
had
fallen
in
two
balls
and
the
fast
bowler
was
swelling
visibly
with
determination
to
do
the
but
pringle
never
went
in
oppressed
by
the
fear
of
getting
out
he
had
a
serene
and
boundless
confidence
in
himself
the
fast
man
tried
a
yorker
pringle
came
down
hard
on
it
and
forced
the
ball
past
the
bowler
for
a
single
then
he
and
norris
settled
down
to
a
lengthy
stand
do
like
seeing
pringle
bat
said
gosling
always
gives
you
the
idea
that
he
doing
you
a
personal
favour
by
knocking
your
bowling
about
oh
well
hit
pringle
had
cut
a
from
the
slow
bowler
to
the
ropes
marriott
who
had
been
silent
and
apparently
in
pain
for
some
minutes
now
gave
out
the
following
homemade
effort
a
dashing
young
sportsman
named
pringle
on
breaking
his
duck
with
a
single
observed
with
a
smile
notice
my
style
how
science
with
vigour
i
mingle
thing
of
my
own
he
added
quoting
england
greatest
librettist
call
it
heart
foam
i
shall
not
publish
it
oh
run
it
out
both
pringle
and
norris
were
evidently
in
form
norris
was
now
not
far
from
his
fifty
and
pringle
looked
as
if
he
might
make
anything
the
century
went
up
and
a
run
later
norris
the
slow
successor
for
three
reaching
his
fifty
by
the
stroke
be
fairly
warm
work
fielding
today
said
reece
jove
said
gethryn
forgot
i
left
my
white
hat
in
the
house
any
of
you
chaps
like
to
fetch
it
there
were
no
offers
gethryn
got
up
you
slacker
come
over
to
the
house
good
sir
i
in
next
why
do
you
wait
till
the
fellows
come
out
of
school
and
send
a
kid
for
it
probably
would
know
where
to
find
it
i
do
know
where
it
is
myself
no
i
shall
go
but
there
no
need
to
fag
about
it
yet
hullo
norris
is
out
norris
had
stopped
a
straight
one
with
his
leg
he
had
made
in
his
best
manner
and
the
school
leaving
the
at
the
exact
moment
when
the
fatal
ball
was
being
bowled
were
just
in
time
to
applaud
him
and
realize
what
they
had
missed
gethryn
desire
for
his
hat
was
not
so
pressing
as
to
make
him
deprive
himself
of
the
pleasure
of
seeing
marriott
at
the
wickets
marriott
ought
to
do
something
special
today
unfortunately
after
he
had
played
out
one
over
and
hit
two
fours
off
it
the
luncheon
interval
began
it
was
therefore
not
for
half
an
hour
that
the
bishop
went
at
last
in
search
of
the
missing
headgear
as
luck
would
have
it
the
hat
was
on
the
table
so
that
whatever
chance
he
might
have
had
of
overlooking
the
note
which
his
uncle
had
left
for
him
on
the
empty
disappeared
the
two
things
caught
his
eye
simultaneously
he
opened
the
note
and
read
it
it
is
not
necessary
to
transcribe
the
note
in
detail
it
was
no
masterpiece
of
literary
skill
but
it
had
this
merit
that
it
was
not
vague
reading
it
one
grasped
its
meaning
immediately
the
bishop
first
feeling
was
that
the
bottom
had
dropped
out
of
everything
suddenly
surprise
was
not
the
word
it
was
the
arrival
of
the
absolutely
unexpected
then
he
began
to
consider
the
position
farnie
must
be
brought
back
that
was
plain
and
he
must
be
brought
back
at
once
before
anyone
could
get
to
hear
of
what
had
happened
gethryn
had
the
very
strongest
objections
to
his
uncle
considered
purely
as
a
human
being
but
the
fact
remained
that
he
was
his
uncle
and
the
bishop
had
equally
strong
objections
to
any
member
of
his
family
being
mixed
up
in
a
business
of
this
description
having
settled
that
point
he
went
on
to
the
next
how
was
he
to
be
brought
back
he
could
not
have
gone
far
for
he
could
not
have
been
gone
much
more
than
half
an
hour
again
from
his
knowledge
of
his
uncle
character
he
deduced
that
he
had
in
all
probability
not
gone
to
the
nearest
station
horton
at
horton
one
had
to
wait
hours
at
a
time
for
a
train
farnie
must
have
made
his
way
on
his
bicycle
straight
for
the
junction
anfield
fifteen
miles
off
by
a
good
road
a
train
left
anfield
for
london
at
it
was
now
a
little
past
two
on
a
bicycle
he
could
do
it
easily
and
get
back
with
his
prize
by
about
five
if
he
rode
hard
in
that
case
all
would
be
well
only
three
of
the
school
wickets
had
fallen
and
the
pitch
was
playing
as
true
as
concrete
besides
there
was
pringle
still
in
at
one
end
well
set
and
surely
marriott
and
jennings
and
the
rest
of
them
would
manage
to
stay
in
till
five
they
could
help
it
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
play
forward
to
everything
and
they
must
stop
in
he
himself
had
got
out
it
was
true
but
that
was
simply
a
regrettable
accident
not
one
man
in
a
hundred
would
have
caught
that
catch
no
with
luck
he
ought
easily
to
be
able
to
do
the
distance
and
get
back
in
time
to
go
out
with
the
rest
of
the
team
to
field
he
ran
downstairs
and
out
of
the
house
on
his
way
to
the
he
stopped
and
looked
towards
the
field
part
of
which
could
be
seen
from
where
he
stood
the
match
had
begun
again
the
fast
bowler
was
just
commencing
his
run
he
saw
him
tear
up
to
the
crease
and
deliver
the
ball
what
happened
then
he
could
not
see
owing
to
the
trees
which
stood
between
him
and
the
school
grounds
but
he
heard
the
crack
of
ball
meeting
bat
and
a
great
howl
of
applause
went
up
from
the
invisible
audience
a
boundary
apparently
yes
there
was
the
umpire
signalling
it
evidently
a
long
stand
was
going
to
be
made
he
would
have
oceans
of
time
for
his
ride
norris
would
dream
of
declaring
the
innings
closed
before
five
at
the
earliest
and
no
bowler
could
take
seven
wickets
in
the
time
on
such
a
pitch
he
hauled
his
bicycle
from
the
shed
and
rode
off
at
racing
speed
in
the
direction
of
anfield
the
match
but
out
in
the
field
things
were
going
badly
with
beckford
the
aspect
of
a
game
often
changes
considerably
after
lunch
for
a
while
it
looked
as
if
marriott
and
pringle
were
in
for
their
respective
centuries
but
marriott
was
never
a
safe
batsman
a
hundred
and
fifty
went
up
on
the
board
off
a
square
leg
hit
for
two
which
completed
pringle
and
then
marriott
faced
the
slow
bowler
who
had
been
put
on
again
after
lunch
the
first
ball
was
a
it
went
behind
point
for
a
couple
the
next
he
got
fairly
hold
of
and
drove
to
the
boundary
the
third
was
a
very
ball
its
sole
merit
appeared
to
be
the
fact
that
it
was
straight
also
it
was
a
trifle
shorter
than
it
looked
marriott
jumped
out
and
got
too
much
under
it
up
it
soared
straight
over
the
bowler
head
a
trifle
more
weight
behind
the
hit
and
it
would
have
cleared
the
ropes
as
it
was
the
man
in
the
never
looked
like
missing
it
the
batsmen
had
time
to
cross
over
before
the
ball
arrived
but
they
did
it
without
enthusiasm
the
run
was
not
likely
to
count
nor
did
it
caught
it
like
a
bird
marriott
had
made
and
now
occurred
one
of
those
rots
which
so
often
happen
without
any
ostensible
cause
in
the
best
regulated
school
elevens
pringle
played
the
three
remaining
balls
of
the
over
without
mishap
but
when
it
was
the
fast
man
turn
to
bowl
to
bruce
marriott
successor
things
began
to
happen
bruce
temporarily
insane
perhaps
through
nervousness
played
back
at
a
and
was
clean
bowled
hill
came
in
and
was
caught
two
balls
later
at
the
wicket
and
the
last
ball
of
the
over
sent
jennings
out
of
the
ground
after
that
batsman
had
scored
two
can
always
bowl
like
blazes
after
lunch
said
the
fast
man
to
pringle
the
lobster
salad
that
does
it
i
think
four
for
a
hundred
and
had
changed
to
seven
for
a
hundred
and
in
the
course
of
a
single
over
gethryn
calculations
if
he
had
only
known
could
have
done
now
with
a
little
revision
gosling
was
the
next
man
he
was
followed
after
a
brief
innings
of
three
balls
which
realized
eight
runs
by
baynes
baynes
though
abstaining
from
runs
himself
helped
pringle
to
add
three
to
the
score
all
in
singles
and
was
then
yorked
by
the
slow
man
who
meanly
and
treacherously
sent
down
without
the
slightest
warning
a
very
fast
one
on
the
leg
stump
then
reece
came
in
for
the
last
wicket
and
the
rot
stopped
reece
always
went
in
last
for
the
school
and
the
school
in
consequence
always
felt
that
there
were
possibilities
to
the
very
end
of
the
innings
the
lot
of
a
man
is
somewhat
trying
as
at
any
moment
his
best
innings
may
be
nipped
in
the
bud
by
the
other
man
getting
out
he
generally
feels
that
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
play
himself
in
before
endeavouring
to
make
runs
he
therefore
tries
to
score
off
every
ball
and
thinks
himself
lucky
if
he
gets
half
a
dozen
reece
however
took
life
more
seriously
he
had
made
quite
an
art
of
batting
once
against
the
butterflies
he
had
run
up
sixty
not
out
and
there
was
always
the
chance
that
he
would
do
the
same
again
today
with
pringle
at
the
other
end
he
looked
forward
to
a
pleasant
hour
or
two
at
the
wicket
no
bowler
ever
looks
on
the
last
man
quite
in
the
same
light
as
he
does
the
other
ten
he
underrates
him
instinctively
the
fast
bowler
was
a
man
with
an
idea
his
idea
was
that
he
could
bowl
a
slow
ball
of
diabolical
ingenuity
as
a
rule
public
feeling
was
against
his
trying
the
experiment
his
captains
were
in
the
habit
of
enquiring
rudely
if
he
thought
he
was
playing
marbles
this
was
exactly
what
the
captain
asked
on
the
present
occasion
when
the
head
ball
sailed
ponderously
through
the
air
and
was
promptly
hit
by
reece
into
the
pavilion
the
bowler
grinned
and
resumed
his
ordinary
pace
but
everything
came
alike
to
reece
pringle
too
continued
his
career
of
triumph
gradually
the
score
rose
from
a
hundred
and
seventy
to
two
hundred
pringle
cut
and
drove
in
all
directions
with
the
air
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
distributing
largesse
the
second
century
went
up
to
the
accompaniment
of
cheers
then
the
slow
bowler
reaped
his
reward
for
pringle
after
putting
his
first
two
balls
over
the
screen
was
caught
on
the
boundary
off
the
third
he
had
contributed
to
a
total
of
two
hundred
and
thirteen
so
far
gethryn
absence
had
not
been
noticed
but
when
the
umpires
had
gone
out
and
the
school
were
getting
ready
to
take
the
field
inquiries
were
made
might
begin
at
the
top
end
gosling
said
norris
said
samuel
going
on
at
the
other
hullo
where
gethryn
he
here
perhaps
he
in
the
pavi
of
you
chaps
seen
gethryn
is
in
the
said
baker
just
come
out
of
the
first
room
myself
and
he
was
there
should
wonder
if
he
over
at
leicester
the
man
said
norris
might
have
known
we
be
going
out
to
field
soon
anyhow
we
ca
wait
for
him
we
shall
have
to
field
a
sub
till
he
turns
up
in
the
changed
said
pringle
right
he
do
and
reinforced
by
the
gratified
lorimer
the
team
went
on
its
way
in
the
beginning
the
fortunes
of
the
school
prospered
gosling
opened
as
was
his
custom
at
a
tremendous
pace
and
seemed
to
trouble
the
first
few
batsmen
considerably
a
little
person
who
had
fielded
with
immense
zeal
during
the
school
innings
at
took
the
first
ball
it
was
very
fast
and
hit
him
just
under
the
the
pain
in
spite
of
the
pad
appeared
to
be
acute
the
little
man
danced
vigorously
for
some
time
and
then
with
much
diffidence
prepared
himself
for
the
second
instalment
now
when
on
the
cricket
field
the
truculent
samuel
was
totally
deficient
in
all
the
finer
feelings
such
as
pity
and
charity
he
could
see
that
the
batsman
was
in
pain
and
yet
his
second
ball
was
faster
than
the
first
it
came
in
quickly
from
the
off
the
little
batsman
went
forward
in
a
hesitating
manner
and
played
a
clear
two
inches
inside
the
ball
the
shot
out
of
the
ground
sammy
said
norris
from
his
place
in
the
slips
the
next
man
was
a
clergyman
a
large
man
who
suggested
possibilities
in
the
way
of
hitting
but
gosling
was
irresistible
for
three
balls
the
priest
survived
but
the
last
of
the
over
a
fast
yorker
on
the
leg
stump
was
too
much
for
him
and
he
retired
two
for
none
the
critic
in
the
deck
chair
felt
that
the
match
was
as
good
as
over
but
this
idyllic
state
of
things
was
not
to
last
the
newcomer
a
tall
man
with
a
light
moustache
which
he
felt
carefully
after
every
ball
soon
settled
down
he
proved
to
be
a
conversationalist
until
he
had
opened
his
account
which
he
did
with
a
strong
drive
to
the
ropes
he
was
silent
when
however
he
had
seen
the
ball
safely
to
the
boundary
he
turned
to
reece
and
began
a
nice
one
that
eh
what
yes
got
it
just
on
the
right
place
you
know
not
a
bad
bat
this
is
it
what
yes
one
of
slogbury
and
whangham
sussex
spankers
do
you
know
chose
it
myself
had
it
in
pickle
all
the
winter
yes
sir
from
the
umpire
what
oh
right
yes
good
make
these
sussex
oh
well
fielded
at
the
word
spankers
he
had
effected
another
drive
but
marriott
at
had
stopped
it
prettily
soon
it
began
to
occur
to
norris
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
have
a
change
of
bowling
gosling
was
getting
tired
and
baynes
apparently
offered
no
difficulties
to
the
batsman
on
the
perfect
wicket
the
conversational
man
in
particular
being
very
severe
upon
him
it
was
at
such
a
crisis
that
the
bishop
should
have
come
in
he
was
understudy
but
where
was
he
the
innings
had
been
in
progress
over
half
an
hour
now
and
still
there
were
no
signs
of
him
a
man
thought
norris
who
could
cut
off
during
the
match
of
all
matches
probably
on
some
rotten
business
of
his
own
was
beyond
the
pale
and
must
on
reappearance
be
fallen
upon
and
rent
he
here
something
small
and
red
whizzed
at
his
face
he
put
up
his
hands
to
protect
himself
the
ball
struck
them
and
bounded
out
again
when
a
fast
bowler
is
bowling
a
slip
he
should
not
indulge
in
the
conversational
man
had
received
his
first
life
and
as
he
was
careful
to
explain
to
reece
it
was
a
curious
thing
but
whenever
he
was
let
off
early
in
his
innings
he
always
made
fifty
and
as
a
rule
a
century
gosling
analysis
was
spoilt
and
the
match
in
all
probability
lost
and
norris
put
it
all
down
to
gethryn
if
he
had
been
there
this
would
not
have
happened
gosling
he
said
right
said
gosling
though
thinking
quite
the
reverse
and
he
walked
back
to
bowl
his
next
ball
conjuring
up
a
beautiful
vision
in
his
mind
douglas
and
braund
were
fielding
slip
to
him
in
the
vision
while
in
the
background
norris
appeared
in
a
cauldron
of
boiling
oil
tut
said
baker
facetiously
to
the
raging
captain
baker
was
essentially
a
flippant
mind
not
even
a
moment
of
solemn
agony
such
as
this
was
sacred
to
him
norris
was
icy
and
severe
you
want
to
rot
about
baker
he
said
you
better
go
and
play
with
the
juniors
retorted
baker
with
great
politeness
suppose
seeing
you
miss
a
gaper
like
that
right
into
your
hands
made
me
think
i
was
playing
with
the
juniors
at
this
point
the
conversation
ceased
baker
suddenly
remembering
that
he
had
not
yet
received
his
first
eleven
colours
and
that
it
would
therefore
be
rash
to
goad
the
captain
too
freely
while
norris
for
his
part
recalled
the
fact
that
baker
had
promised
to
do
some
latin
verse
for
him
that
evening
and
might
if
crushed
with
some
scathing
repartee
refuse
to
go
through
with
that
contract
so
there
was
silence
in
the
slips
the
partnership
was
broken
at
last
by
a
lucky
accident
the
conversationalist
called
his
partner
for
a
short
run
and
when
that
unfortunate
gentleman
had
sprinted
some
twenty
yards
reconsidered
the
matter
and
sent
him
back
reece
had
the
bails
off
before
the
victim
had
completed
a
third
of
the
return
journey
for
some
time
after
this
matters
began
to
favour
the
school
again
with
the
score
at
a
hundred
and
five
three
men
left
in
two
overs
one
bowled
by
gosling
the
others
caught
at
point
and
in
the
deep
off
jennings
who
had
deposed
baynes
six
wickets
were
now
down
and
the
enemy
still
over
a
hundred
behind
but
the
in
its
school
matches
has
this
peculiarity
however
badly
it
may
seem
to
stand
there
is
always
something
up
its
sleeve
in
this
case
it
was
a
professional
a
man
indecently
devoid
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
nerves
he
played
the
bowling
with
a
stolid
confidence
amounting
almost
to
contempt
which
struck
a
chill
to
the
hearts
of
the
school
bowlers
it
did
worse
it
induced
them
to
bowl
with
the
sole
object
of
getting
the
conversationalist
at
the
batting
end
thus
enabling
the
professional
to
pile
up
an
unassuming
but
rapidly
increasing
score
by
means
of
threes
and
singles
as
for
the
conversationalist
he
had
made
thirty
or
more
and
wanted
all
the
bowling
he
could
get
a
very
curious
thing
he
said
to
reece
as
he
faced
gosling
after
his
partner
had
scored
a
three
off
the
first
ball
of
the
over
some
fellows
simply
detest
fast
bowling
now
i
he
never
finished
the
sentence
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
to
begin
a
new
one
on
earth
did
that
happen
he
asked
think
it
bowled
you
said
reece
stolidly
picking
up
the
two
stumps
which
had
been
uprooted
by
gosling
express
but
how
dash
it
what
i
ca
underst
most
curious
thing
i
ever
dash
it
all
you
know
he
drifted
off
in
the
direction
of
the
pavilion
stopping
on
the
way
to
ask
short
leg
his
opinion
of
the
matter
sammy
said
reece
putting
on
the
bails
bowled
gosling
growled
norris
from
the
slips
the
marvel
by
jove
said
marriott
it
on
samuel
more
and
more
wish
norris
would
give
me
a
rest
where
on
earth
is
that
man
gethryn
is
it
there
going
to
be
something
of
a
row
about
it
norris
seems
to
be
getting
rather
shirty
hullo
here
comes
the
deathless
author
the
author
referred
to
was
the
new
batsman
a
distinguished
novelist
who
played
a
good
deal
for
the
he
broke
his
journey
to
the
wicket
to
speak
to
the
conversationalist
who
was
still
engaged
with
short
leg
old
man
he
said
you
going
to
the
pavilion
you
might
wait
for
me
i
shall
be
out
in
an
hour
or
two
upon
which
bates
awaking
suddenly
to
the
position
of
affairs
went
on
his
way
with
the
arrival
of
the
deathless
author
an
unwelcome
change
came
over
the
game
his
cricket
style
resembled
his
literary
style
both
were
straightforward
and
vigorous
the
first
two
balls
he
received
from
gosling
he
drove
hard
past
cover
point
to
the
ropes
gosling
who
had
been
bowling
unchanged
since
the
innings
began
was
naturally
feeling
a
little
tired
he
was
losing
his
length
and
bowling
more
slowly
than
was
his
wont
norris
now
gave
him
a
rest
for
a
few
overs
bruce
going
on
with
rather
innocuous
medium
bowling
the
professional
continued
to
jog
along
slowly
the
novelist
hit
everything
seemed
to
come
alike
to
him
gosling
resumed
but
without
effect
while
at
the
other
end
bowler
after
bowler
was
tried
from
a
hundred
and
ten
the
score
rose
and
rose
and
still
the
two
remained
together
a
hundred
and
ninety
went
up
and
norris
in
despair
threw
the
ball
to
marriott
you
are
marriott
he
said
afraid
we
shall
have
to
try
you
what
i
call
really
nicely
expressed
said
marriott
to
the
umpire
over
the
wicket
marriott
was
a
slow
sort
of
bowler
that
is
to
say
in
a
house
match
he
was
quite
likely
to
get
wickets
but
in
a
first
eleven
match
such
an
event
was
highly
improbable
his
bowling
looked
very
subtle
and
if
the
ball
was
allowed
to
touch
the
ground
it
occasionally
broke
quite
a
remarkable
distance
the
forlorn
hope
succeeded
the
professional
for
the
first
time
in
his
innings
took
a
risk
he
slashed
at
a
very
mild
ball
almost
a
wide
on
the
off
side
the
ball
touched
the
corner
of
the
bat
and
soared
up
in
the
direction
of
where
pringle
held
it
comfortably
you
are
said
marriott
you
put
a
really
scientific
bowler
on
you
bound
to
get
a
wicket
why
on
earth
did
i
go
on
before
norris
wait
said
norris
are
five
more
balls
of
the
over
to
come
job
for
the
batsman
said
marriott
there
had
been
time
for
a
run
before
the
ball
reached
pringle
so
that
the
novelist
was
now
at
the
batting
end
marriott
next
ball
was
not
unlike
his
first
but
it
was
straighter
and
consequently
easier
to
get
at
the
novelist
hit
it
into
the
road
when
it
had
been
brought
back
he
hit
it
into
the
road
again
marriott
suggested
that
he
had
better
have
a
man
there
the
fourth
ball
of
the
over
was
too
wide
to
hit
with
any
comfort
and
the
batsman
let
it
alone
the
fifth
went
for
four
to
square
leg
almost
killing
the
umpire
on
its
way
and
the
sixth
soared
in
the
old
familiar
manner
into
the
road
again
marriott
over
had
yielded
exactly
runs
four
to
win
and
two
wickets
to
fall
never
read
another
of
that
man
books
as
long
as
i
live
said
marriott
to
gosling
giving
him
the
ball
our
only
hope
sammy
do
go
in
and
win
the
new
batsman
had
the
bowling
he
snicked
his
first
ball
for
a
single
bringing
the
novelist
to
the
fore
again
and
samuel
wilberforce
gosling
vowed
a
vow
that
he
would
dismiss
that
distinguished
novelist
but
the
best
intentions
go
for
nothing
when
one
arm
is
feeling
like
lead
of
all
the
miserable
balls
sent
down
that
afternoon
that
one
of
gosling
was
the
worst
it
was
worse
than
anything
of
marriott
it
flew
sluggishly
down
the
pitch
well
outside
the
leg
stump
the
novelist
watched
it
come
and
his
eye
gleamed
it
was
about
to
bounce
for
the
second
time
when
with
a
pleased
smile
the
batsman
stepped
out
there
was
a
loud
musical
report
the
note
of
a
bat
when
it
strikes
the
ball
fairly
on
the
driving
spot
the
man
of
letters
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
watched
the
ball
diminish
in
the
distance
rather
think
said
he
cheerfully
as
a
crash
of
glass
told
of
its
arrival
at
the
pavilion
that
does
it
he
was
perfectly
right
it
did
the
bishop
finishes
his
ride
gethryn
had
started
on
his
ride
handicapped
by
two
things
he
did
not
know
his
way
after
the
first
two
miles
and
the
hedges
at
the
roadside
had
just
been
clipped
leaving
the
roads
covered
with
small
thorns
it
was
the
former
of
these
circumstances
that
first
made
itself
apparent
for
two
miles
the
road
ran
straight
but
after
that
it
was
unexplored
country
the
bishop
being
in
both
cricket
and
football
teams
had
few
opportunities
for
cycling
he
always
brought
his
machine
to
school
but
he
very
seldom
used
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
unexplored
country
an
irresponsible
person
recommended
him
to
go
straight
on
he
could
miss
the
road
said
he
it
was
straight
all
the
way
gethryn
thanked
him
rode
on
and
having
gone
a
mile
came
upon
three
roads
each
of
which
might
quite
well
have
been
considered
a
continuation
of
the
road
on
which
he
was
already
one
curved
gently
off
to
the
right
the
other
two
equally
gently
to
the
left
he
dismounted
and
the
feelings
of
gratitude
which
he
had
borne
towards
his
informant
for
his
lucid
directions
vanished
suddenly
he
gazed
searchingly
at
the
three
roads
but
to
single
out
one
of
them
as
straighter
than
the
other
two
was
a
task
that
baffled
him
completely
a
informed
him
of
three
things
by
following
road
one
he
might
get
to
brindleham
and
ultimately
if
he
persevered
to
corden
road
number
two
would
lead
him
to
old
inns
whatever
they
might
be
with
the
further
inducement
of
little
benbury
while
if
he
cast
in
his
lot
with
road
three
he
might
hope
sooner
or
later
to
arrive
at
much
and
lesser
but
on
the
subject
of
anfield
and
anfield
junction
the
board
was
silent
two
courses
lay
open
to
him
should
he
select
a
route
at
random
or
wait
for
somebody
to
come
and
direct
him
he
waited
he
went
on
waiting
he
waited
a
considerable
time
and
at
last
just
as
he
was
about
to
trust
to
luck
and
make
for
much
a
figure
loomed
in
sight
a
man
who
strolled
down
the
old
inns
road
at
a
pace
which
seemed
to
argue
that
he
had
plenty
of
time
on
his
hands
say
can
you
tell
me
the
way
to
anfield
please
said
the
bishop
as
he
came
up
the
man
stopped
apparently
rooted
to
the
spot
he
surveyed
the
bishop
with
a
glassy
but
determined
stare
from
head
to
foot
then
he
looked
earnestly
at
the
bicycle
and
finally
in
perfect
silence
began
to
inspect
the
bishop
again
he
said
at
length
you
tell
me
the
way
to
anfield
how
do
i
get
there
the
man
perpended
and
when
he
replied
did
so
after
the
style
of
the
late
and
great
ollendorf
inns
he
said
dreamily
waving
a
hand
down
the
road
by
which
he
had
come
over
there
yes
i
know
said
gethryn
born
at
old
inns
i
was
continued
the
man
warming
to
his
subject
there
years
i
have
yeou
go
straight
down
the
road
an
yeou
cam
t
old
inns
yes
that
be
the
way
t
old
inns
gethryn
nobly
refrained
from
rending
the
speaker
limb
from
limb
do
want
to
know
the
way
to
old
inns
he
said
desperately
i
want
to
get
is
anfield
anfield
you
know
which
way
do
i
go
said
the
man
then
a
brilliant
flash
of
intelligence
illumined
his
countenance
anfield
be
same
road
as
old
inns
yeou
go
straight
down
the
road
an
very
much
said
gethryn
and
without
waiting
for
further
revelations
shot
off
in
the
direction
indicated
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
the
man
was
still
there
gazing
after
him
in
a
kind
of
trance
the
bishop
passed
through
old
inns
with
some
way
on
his
machine
he
had
much
lost
time
to
make
up
a
signpost
bearing
the
legend
four
miles
told
him
that
he
was
nearing
his
destination
the
notice
had
changed
to
three
miles
and
again
to
two
when
suddenly
he
felt
that
jarring
sensation
which
every
cyclist
knows
his
back
tyre
was
punctured
it
was
impossible
to
ride
on
he
got
off
and
walked
he
was
still
in
his
cricket
clothes
and
the
fact
that
he
had
on
spiked
boots
did
not
make
walking
any
the
easier
his
progress
was
not
rapid
half
an
hour
before
his
one
wish
had
been
to
catch
sight
of
a
now
when
he
would
have
preferred
to
have
avoided
his
species
men
seemed
to
spring
up
from
nowhere
and
every
man
of
them
had
a
remark
to
make
or
a
question
to
ask
about
the
punctured
tyre
reserve
is
not
the
leading
characteristic
of
the
average
yokel
gethryn
however
refused
to
be
drawn
into
conversation
on
the
subject
at
last
one
more
determined
than
the
rest
brought
him
to
bay
mister
stop
called
a
voice
gethryn
turned
a
man
was
running
up
the
road
towards
him
he
arrived
panting
up
said
the
bishop
got
a
puncture
said
the
man
pointing
an
accusing
finger
at
the
flattened
tyre
it
was
not
worth
while
killing
the
brute
probably
he
was
acting
from
the
best
motives
said
gethryn
wearily
is
a
puncture
i
always
let
the
air
out
when
i
riding
it
looks
so
much
better
do
you
think
so
why
did
they
let
you
out
and
feeling
a
little
more
comfortable
after
this
outburst
he
wheeled
his
bicycle
on
into
anfield
high
street
minds
in
the
village
of
anfield
worked
with
extraordinary
rapidity
the
first
person
of
whom
he
asked
the
way
to
the
junction
answered
the
riddle
almost
without
thinking
he
left
his
machine
out
in
the
road
and
went
on
to
the
platform
the
first
thing
that
caught
his
eye
was
the
station
clock
with
its
hands
pointing
to
five
past
four
and
when
he
realized
that
his
uncle
train
having
left
a
clear
half
hour
before
his
labours
had
all
been
for
nothing
the
full
bitterness
of
life
came
home
to
him
he
was
turning
away
from
the
station
when
he
stopped
something
else
had
caught
his
eye
on
a
bench
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
platform
sat
a
youth
and
a
further
scrutiny
convinced
the
bishop
of
the
fact
that
the
youth
was
none
other
than
master
reginald
farnie
late
of
beckford
and
shortly
or
he
would
know
the
reason
why
to
be
once
more
of
beckford
other
people
besides
himself
it
appeared
could
miss
trains
farnie
was
reading
one
of
those
halfpenny
weeklies
which
with
a
nerve
which
is
the
only
creditable
thing
about
them
call
themselves
comic
he
did
not
see
the
bishop
until
a
shadow
falling
across
his
paper
caused
him
to
look
up
it
was
not
often
that
he
found
himself
unequal
to
a
situation
monk
in
a
recent
conversation
had
taken
him
aback
somewhat
but
his
feelings
on
that
occasion
were
not
to
be
compared
with
what
he
felt
on
seeing
the
one
person
whom
he
least
desired
to
meet
standing
at
his
side
his
jaw
dropped
limply
fluttered
to
the
ground
the
bishop
was
the
first
to
speak
indeed
if
he
had
waited
for
farnie
to
break
the
silence
he
would
have
waited
long
up
he
said
farnie
got
up
on
farnie
came
and
get
your
machine
said
gethryn
up
and
now
you
will
jolly
well
come
back
to
beckford
you
little
beast
but
before
that
could
be
done
there
was
gethryn
back
wheel
to
be
mended
this
took
time
it
was
nearly
half
past
four
before
they
started
said
gethryn
as
they
were
about
to
mount
that
money
i
was
forgetting
out
with
it
ten
pounds
had
been
the
sum
farnie
had
taken
from
the
study
six
was
all
he
was
able
to
restore
gethryn
enquired
after
the
deficit
gave
it
to
monk
said
farnie
to
gethryn
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
the
mere
mention
of
monk
was
sufficient
to
uncork
the
vials
of
his
wrath
the
blazes
did
you
do
that
for
what
monk
got
to
do
with
it
said
he
get
me
sacked
if
i
did
pay
him
whined
farnie
this
was
not
strictly
true
monk
had
not
said
he
had
hinted
and
he
had
hinted
at
flogging
not
expulsion
pursued
the
bishop
had
you
and
monk
been
up
to
farnie
using
his
adventures
as
a
foundation
worked
up
a
highly
artistic
narrative
of
doings
which
if
they
had
actually
been
performed
would
certainly
have
entailed
expulsion
he
had
judged
gethryn
character
correctly
if
the
matter
had
been
simply
a
case
for
a
flogging
the
bishop
would
have
stood
aside
and
let
the
thing
go
on
against
the
extreme
penalty
of
school
law
he
felt
bound
as
a
matter
of
family
duty
to
shield
his
relative
and
he
saw
a
bad
time
coming
for
himself
in
the
very
near
future
either
he
must
expose
farnie
which
he
had
resolved
not
to
do
or
he
must
refuse
to
explain
his
absence
from
the
match
for
by
now
there
was
not
the
smallest
chance
of
his
being
able
to
get
back
in
time
for
the
visitors
innings
as
he
rode
on
he
tried
to
imagine
what
would
happen
in
consequence
of
that
desertion
and
he
could
not
do
it
his
crime
was
so
far
as
he
knew
absolutely
without
precedent
in
the
school
history
as
they
passed
the
cricket
field
he
saw
that
it
was
empty
stumps
were
usually
drawn
early
in
the
match
if
the
issue
of
the
game
was
out
of
doubt
as
the
marylebone
men
had
trains
to
catch
evidently
this
had
happened
today
it
might
mean
that
the
school
had
won
easily
they
had
looked
like
making
a
big
score
when
he
had
left
the
ground
in
which
case
public
opinion
would
be
more
lenient
towards
him
after
a
victory
a
school
feels
that
all
well
that
ends
well
but
it
might
on
the
other
hand
mean
quite
the
reverse
he
put
his
machine
up
and
hurried
to
the
study
several
boys
as
he
passed
them
looked
curiously
at
him
but
none
spoke
to
him
marriott
was
in
the
study
reading
a
book
he
was
still
in
flannels
and
looked
as
if
he
had
begun
to
change
but
had
thought
better
of
it
as
was
actually
the
case
he
cried
as
gethryn
appeared
the
dickens
have
you
been
all
the
afternoon
what
on
earth
did
you
go
off
like
that
for
sorry
old
chap
said
the
bishop
ca
tell
you
i
sha
be
able
to
tell
anyone
man
try
and
realize
what
you
done
do
you
grasp
the
fact
that
you
gone
and
got
the
school
licked
in
the
match
and
that
we
have
beaten
the
for
about
a
dozen
years
and
that
if
been
there
to
bowl
we
should
have
walked
over
this
time
do
try
and
grasp
the
thing
they
win
by
a
wicket
two
wickets
i
mean
we
made
your
bowling
would
just
have
done
it
gethryn
sat
down
lord
he
said
blankly
is
awful
look
here
bishop
continued
marriott
is
all
rot
you
ca
do
a
thing
like
this
and
then
refuse
to
offer
any
explanation
and
expect
things
to
go
on
just
as
usual
do
said
gethryn
know
there
going
to
be
a
row
but
i
explain
you
have
to
take
me
on
trust
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
all
right
said
marriott
know
you
would
be
ass
enough
to
do
a
thing
like
that
without
a
jolly
good
reason
it
the
other
chaps
i
thinking
about
you
find
it
jolly
hard
to
put
norris
off
i
afraid
he
most
awfully
sick
about
the
match
he
fielded
badly
which
always
makes
him
shirty
jephson
too
you
have
a
bad
time
with
jephson
his
one
wish
after
the
match
was
to
have
your
gore
and
plenty
of
it
nothing
else
would
have
pleased
him
a
bit
and
think
of
the
chaps
in
the
house
too
just
consider
what
a
pull
this
gives
monk
and
his
mob
over
you
the
house
want
some
looking
after
now
i
fancy
they
get
it
said
gethryn
monk
gives
me
any
of
his
beastly
cheek
i
knock
his
head
off
but
in
spite
of
the
consolation
which
such
a
prospect
afforded
him
he
did
not
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
next
day
when
he
would
have
to
meet
norris
and
the
rest
it
would
have
been
bad
in
any
case
he
did
not
care
to
think
what
would
happen
when
he
refused
to
offer
the
slightest
explanation
in
which
a
case
is
fully
discussed
gethryn
was
right
in
thinking
that
the
interviews
would
be
unpleasant
they
increased
in
unpleasantness
in
arithmetical
progression
until
they
culminated
finally
in
a
terrific
encounter
with
the
justly
outraged
norris
reece
was
the
first
person
to
institute
inquiries
and
if
everybody
had
resembled
him
matters
would
not
have
been
so
bad
for
gethryn
reece
possessed
a
perfect
genius
for
minding
his
own
business
the
dialogue
when
they
met
was
brief
said
reece
said
the
bishop
did
you
get
to
yesterday
said
reece
i
had
to
go
somewhere
said
the
bishop
vaguely
pity
was
a
bad
match
and
that
was
all
the
comment
reece
made
on
the
situation
gethryn
went
over
to
the
chapel
that
morning
with
an
empty
sinking
feeling
inside
him
he
was
quite
determined
to
offer
no
single
word
of
explanation
and
he
felt
that
that
made
the
prospect
all
the
worse
there
was
a
vast
uncertainty
in
his
mind
as
to
what
was
going
to
happen
nobody
could
actually
do
anything
to
him
of
course
it
would
have
been
a
decided
relief
to
him
if
anybody
had
tried
that
line
of
action
for
moments
occur
when
the
only
thing
that
can
adequately
soothe
the
wounded
spirit
is
to
hit
straight
from
the
shoulder
at
someone
the
is
often
found
useful
under
these
circumstances
as
he
was
passing
jephson
house
he
nearly
ran
into
somebody
who
was
coming
out
firm
my
moral
pecker
thought
gethryn
and
braced
himself
up
for
conflict
gethryn
said
mr
jephson
the
question
especially
when
addressed
by
a
master
to
a
boy
is
one
of
the
few
questions
to
which
there
is
literally
no
answer
you
can
look
sheepish
you
can
look
defiant
or
you
can
look
surprised
according
to
the
state
of
your
conscience
but
anything
in
the
way
of
verbal
response
is
impossible
gethryn
attempted
no
verbal
response
gethryn
went
on
mr
jephson
it
pleasant
up
the
river
yesterday
mr
jephson
always
preferred
the
rapier
of
sarcasm
to
the
bludgeon
of
abuse
sir
said
gethryn
pleasant
he
did
not
mean
to
be
massacred
without
a
struggle
cried
mr
jephson
actually
mean
to
say
that
you
did
go
up
the
river
sir
what
do
you
mean
is
always
pleasant
up
the
river
on
a
fine
day
said
gethryn
his
opponent
to
use
a
metaphor
suitable
to
a
cricket
master
changed
his
action
he
abandoned
sarcasm
and
condescended
to
direct
inquiry
were
you
yesterday
afternoon
he
said
the
bishop
like
mr
hurry
bungsho
jabberjee
became
at
once
the
silent
tomb
you
hear
what
i
said
gethryn
icily
were
you
yesterday
afternoon
ca
say
sir
these
words
may
convey
two
meanings
they
may
imply
ignorance
in
which
case
the
speaker
should
be
led
gently
off
to
the
nearest
asylum
or
they
may
imply
obstinacy
mr
jephson
decided
that
in
the
present
case
obstinacy
lay
at
the
root
of
the
matter
he
became
icier
than
ever
well
gethryn
he
said
shall
report
this
to
the
headmaster
and
gethryn
feeling
that
the
conference
was
at
an
end
proceeded
on
his
way
after
chapel
there
was
norris
to
be
handled
norris
had
been
rather
late
for
chapel
that
morning
and
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
the
bishop
but
after
the
service
was
over
and
the
school
streamed
out
of
the
building
towards
their
respective
houses
he
waylaid
him
at
the
door
and
demanded
an
explanation
the
bishop
refused
to
give
one
norris
whose
temper
never
had
a
chance
of
reaching
its
accustomed
tranquillity
until
he
had
consumed
some
breakfast
he
hated
early
morning
chapel
raved
the
bishop
was
worried
but
firm
you
mean
to
say
you
do
mean
to
say
i
mean
you
do
intend
to
explain
said
norris
finally
working
round
for
the
twentieth
time
to
his
original
text
ca
explain
wo
you
mean
i
apologize
if
you
like
but
i
wo
explain
norris
felt
the
strain
was
becoming
too
much
for
him
he
moaned
addressing
circumambient
space
a
man
cuts
off
in
the
middle
of
the
match
loses
us
the
game
and
then
comes
back
and
offers
to
apologize
offer
withdrawn
put
in
gethryn
and
explanations
are
both
off
it
was
hopeless
to
try
and
be
conciliatory
under
the
circumstances
they
did
not
admit
of
it
norris
glared
suppose
he
said
do
expect
to
go
on
playing
for
the
first
after
this
we
ca
keep
a
place
open
for
you
in
the
team
on
the
off
chance
of
your
not
having
a
previous
engagement
you
know
your
affair
said
the
bishop
captain
have
you
finished
your
address
is
there
anything
else
you
like
to
say
norris
considered
and
as
he
went
in
at
jephson
gate
wound
up
with
this
parthian
shaft
i
can
say
is
that
you
not
fit
to
be
at
a
public
school
they
ought
to
sack
a
chap
for
doing
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
take
my
advice
you
leave
about
two
hours
afterwards
gethryn
discovered
a
suitable
retort
but
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
better
late
than
never
does
not
apply
to
repartees
refrained
from
speaking
it
it
was
mr
jephson
usual
custom
to
sally
out
after
supper
on
sunday
evenings
to
smoke
a
pipe
or
several
pipes
with
one
of
the
other
on
this
particular
evening
he
made
for
robertson
which
was
one
of
the
four
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
school
grounds
he
could
hardly
have
selected
a
better
man
to
take
his
grievance
to
mr
robertson
was
a
long
silent
man
with
grizzled
hair
and
an
eye
that
pierced
like
a
gimlet
he
had
the
enviable
reputation
of
keeping
the
best
order
of
any
master
in
the
school
he
was
also
one
of
the
most
popular
of
the
staff
this
was
all
the
more
remarkable
from
the
fact
that
he
played
no
games
to
him
came
mr
jephson
primed
to
bursting
point
with
his
grievance
wrong
jephson
said
mr
robertson
i
should
just
think
there
was
did
you
happen
to
be
looking
at
the
match
yesterday
robertson
mr
robertson
nodded
always
watch
school
matches
good
match
norris
missed
a
bad
catch
in
the
slips
he
was
asleep
mr
jephson
conceded
the
point
it
was
trivial
he
said
should
certainly
have
held
it
but
that
a
mere
detail
i
want
to
talk
about
gethryn
do
you
know
what
he
did
yesterday
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
never
went
off
during
the
luncheon
interval
without
a
word
and
never
appeared
again
till
and
now
he
refuses
to
offer
any
explanation
whatever
i
shall
report
the
whole
thing
to
beckett
i
told
gethryn
so
this
morning
should
said
mr
robertson
really
think
i
should
beckett
finds
the
ordinary
duties
of
a
headmaster
quite
sufficient
for
his
needs
this
business
is
not
in
his
province
at
all
in
his
province
my
dear
sir
what
is
a
headmaster
for
if
not
to
manage
affairs
of
this
sort
mr
robertson
smiled
in
a
manner
and
answered
after
the
fashion
of
socrates
with
a
question
me
ask
you
two
things
jephson
you
must
proceed
gingerly
now
firstly
it
is
a
headmaster
business
to
punish
any
breach
of
school
rules
is
it
not
school
prefects
do
not
attend
and
have
no
restrictions
placed
upon
them
in
the
matter
of
bounds
well
perhaps
you
tell
me
what
school
rule
gethryn
has
broken
said
mr
robertson
see
you
ca
he
went
on
course
you
ca
he
has
not
broken
any
school
rule
he
is
a
prefect
and
may
do
anything
he
likes
with
his
spare
time
he
chooses
to
play
cricket
then
he
changes
his
mind
and
goes
off
to
some
unknown
locality
for
some
reason
at
present
unexplained
it
is
all
perfectly
legal
extremely
quaint
behaviour
on
his
part
i
admit
but
thoroughly
legal
nothing
can
be
done
exclaimed
mr
jephson
blankly
absurd
something
must
be
done
the
thing
ca
be
left
as
it
is
preposterous
should
imagine
said
mr
robertson
what
small
knowledge
i
possess
of
the
human
boy
that
matters
will
be
made
decidedly
unpleasant
for
the
criminal
i
know
one
thing
he
wo
play
for
the
team
again
is
something
very
refreshing
about
your
logic
jephson
because
a
boy
does
not
play
in
one
match
you
will
not
let
him
play
in
any
of
the
others
though
you
admit
his
absence
weakens
the
team
however
i
suppose
that
is
unavoidable
mind
you
i
think
it
is
a
pity
of
course
gethryn
has
some
explanation
if
he
would
only
favour
us
with
it
personally
i
think
rather
highly
of
gethryn
so
does
poor
old
leicester
he
is
the
only
leicester
has
had
for
the
last
years
who
knows
even
the
rudiments
of
his
business
but
no
use
my
preaching
his
virtues
to
you
you
would
listen
take
another
cigar
and
let
talk
about
the
weather
mr
jephson
took
the
proffered
weed
and
the
conversation
though
it
did
not
turn
upon
the
suggested
topic
ceased
to
have
anything
to
do
with
gethryn
the
general
opinion
of
the
school
was
dead
against
the
bishop
one
or
two
of
his
friends
still
clung
to
a
hope
that
explanations
might
come
out
while
there
were
also
a
few
who
always
made
a
point
of
thinking
differently
from
everybody
else
of
this
class
was
pringle
on
the
monday
after
the
match
he
spent
the
best
part
of
an
hour
of
his
valuable
time
reasoning
on
the
subject
with
lorimer
lorimer
vote
went
with
the
majority
although
he
had
fielded
for
the
bishop
he
was
not
of
course
being
merely
a
substitute
allowed
to
bowl
as
the
bishop
had
had
his
innings
and
it
had
been
particularly
galling
to
him
to
feel
that
he
might
have
saved
the
match
if
it
had
only
been
possible
for
him
to
have
played
a
larger
part
no
good
jawing
about
it
he
said
is
a
word
to
say
for
the
man
he
has
a
leg
to
stand
on
why
it
would
be
bad
enough
in
a
house
or
form
match
even
but
when
it
comes
to
first
matches
here
words
failed
lorimer
at
all
said
pringle
unmoved
are
heaps
of
reasons
jolly
good
reasons
why
he
might
have
gone
away
as
said
lorimer
he
might
have
been
called
away
by
a
telegram
for
instance
rot
why
should
he
make
such
a
mystery
of
it
if
that
was
all
have
explained
all
right
if
somebody
had
asked
him
properly
you
get
a
chap
like
norris
who
when
he
loses
his
hair
has
got
just
about
as
much
tact
as
a
rhinoceros
going
and
ballyragging
the
man
and
no
wonder
he
wo
say
anything
i
should
myself
go
and
talk
to
him
decently
then
let
see
you
do
it
and
bet
it
wo
make
a
bit
of
difference
what
the
chap
has
done
is
to
go
and
get
himself
mixed
up
in
some
shady
business
somewhere
that
the
only
thing
it
can
be
said
pringle
bishop
is
that
sort
of
chap
ca
tell
i
say
he
broke
off
suddenly
you
done
that
poem
yet
pringle
started
he
had
not
so
much
as
begun
that
promised
epic
er
have
quite
finished
it
yet
i
thinking
it
out
you
know
getting
a
sort
of
general
grip
of
the
thing
well
i
wish
you
buck
up
with
it
it
got
to
go
in
tomorrow
week
week
tuesday
the
what
is
it
right
remember
two
days
after
the
match
that
fix
it
in
my
mind
by
the
way
your
people
are
going
to
come
down
all
right
are
they
i
mean
we
shall
have
to
be
getting
in
supplies
and
so
on
they
be
coming
there
plenty
of
time
though
to
think
of
that
what
you
got
to
do
for
the
present
is
to
keep
your
mind
glued
on
the
death
of
dido
said
pringle
wo
forget
this
was
at
six
by
the
time
boomed
from
the
college
pringle
was
absorbing
a
thrilling
work
of
fiction
and
dido
her
death
and
everything
connected
with
her
had
faded
from
his
mind
like
a
beautiful
dream
poetry
and
the
old
beckfordians
match
came
off
in
due
season
and
pringle
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
though
he
only
contributed
a
dozen
in
the
first
innings
he
made
up
for
this
afterwards
in
the
second
when
the
school
had
a
hundred
and
twenty
to
get
in
just
two
hours
he
went
in
first
with
marriott
and
they
pulled
the
thing
off
and
gave
the
school
a
ten
wickets
victory
with
eight
minutes
to
spare
pringle
was
in
rare
form
he
made
mainly
off
the
bowling
of
a
certain
smith
whose
fag
he
had
been
in
the
old
days
when
at
school
smith
had
always
been
singularly
aggressive
towards
pringle
and
the
latter
found
that
much
pleasure
was
to
be
derived
from
hitting
fours
off
his
bowling
subsequently
he
ate
more
strawberries
and
cream
than
were
strictly
speaking
good
for
him
and
did
the
honours
at
the
study
with
the
grace
of
a
born
host
and
as
he
had
hoped
miss
mabel
lorimer
ask
what
that
was
stuck
on
to
that
bat
for
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
in
the
midst
of
these
festivities
such
trivialities
as
lorimer
poem
found
no
place
in
his
thoughts
it
was
not
until
the
following
day
that
he
was
reminded
of
it
that
sunday
was
a
visiting
sunday
visiting
sundays
occurred
three
times
a
term
when
everybody
who
had
friends
and
relations
in
the
neighbourhood
was
allowed
to
spend
the
day
with
them
pringle
on
such
occasions
used
to
ride
over
to
biddlehampton
the
scene
of
adventures
on
somebody
else
bicycle
his
destination
being
the
residence
of
a
certain
colonel
ashby
no
relation
but
a
great
friend
of
his
father
the
gallant
colonel
had
besides
his
other
merits
which
were
numerous
the
pleasant
characteristic
of
leaving
his
guests
to
themselves
to
be
left
to
oneself
under
some
circumstances
is
apt
to
be
a
drawback
but
in
this
case
there
was
never
any
lack
of
amusements
the
only
objection
that
pringle
ever
found
was
that
there
was
too
much
to
do
in
the
time
there
was
shooting
riding
fishing
and
also
given
proper
conditions
no
game
in
existence
yields
to
in
the
matter
of
excitement
a
makes
the
best
pitch
for
the
walls
stop
all
hits
and
you
score
solely
by
boundaries
one
for
every
hit
two
if
it
goes
past
the
door
four
to
the
end
wall
and
out
if
you
send
it
over
it
is
perfect
there
were
two
junior
ashbys
twins
aged
sixteen
they
went
to
school
at
charchester
returning
to
the
ancestral
home
for
the
weekend
sometimes
when
pringle
came
they
would
bring
a
school
friend
in
which
case
pringle
and
he
would
play
the
twins
but
as
a
rule
the
programme
consisted
of
a
series
of
five
test
matches
charchester
beckford
and
as
pringle
was
almost
exactly
twice
as
good
as
each
of
the
twins
taken
individually
when
they
combined
it
made
the
sides
very
even
and
the
test
matches
were
fought
out
with
the
most
deadly
keenness
after
lunch
the
colonel
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
pringle
for
a
stroll
in
the
grounds
to
watch
him
smoke
a
cigar
or
two
on
this
sunday
the
conversation
during
the
walk
after
beginning
as
was
right
and
proper
with
cricket
turned
to
work
me
see
said
the
colonel
as
pringle
finished
the
description
of
how
point
had
almost
got
to
the
square
cut
which
had
given
him
his
century
against
charchester
out
of
the
upper
fifth
now
you
i
always
used
to
think
you
were
going
to
be
a
fixture
there
you
are
like
your
father
in
that
way
i
remember
him
at
rugby
spending
years
on
end
in
the
same
form
could
get
out
of
it
but
you
did
get
your
remove
if
i
remember
said
pringle
ago
that
to
say
last
term
and
jolly
glad
i
did
too
his
errant
memory
had
returned
to
the
poetry
prize
once
more
said
the
colonel
is
that
pringle
explained
the
peculiar
disadvantages
that
attended
membership
of
the
upper
fifth
during
the
summer
term
do
think
a
man
ought
to
be
allowed
to
spend
his
money
in
these
special
prizes
he
concluded
any
rate
they
ought
to
be
sixth
form
affairs
it
hard
enough
having
to
do
the
ordinary
work
and
keep
up
your
cricket
at
the
same
time
are
compulsory
then
swindle
i
call
it
the
chap
who
shares
my
study
at
beckford
is
in
the
upper
fifth
and
his
hair
turning
white
under
the
strain
the
worst
of
it
is
too
that
i
promised
to
help
him
and
i
never
seem
to
have
any
time
to
give
to
the
thing
i
could
turn
out
a
great
poem
if
i
had
an
hour
or
two
to
spare
now
and
then
the
subject
of
dido
this
year
they
are
always
jolly
keen
on
deaths
last
year
it
was
cato
and
the
year
before
julius
caesar
they
seem
to
have
very
morbid
minds
i
think
they
might
try
something
cheerful
for
a
change
said
the
colonel
dreamily
of
dido
where
have
i
heard
either
a
story
or
a
poem
or
a
riddle
or
something
in
some
way
connected
with
the
death
of
dido
it
was
years
ago
but
i
distinctly
remember
having
heard
somebody
mention
the
occurrence
oh
well
it
will
come
back
presently
i
dare
say
it
did
come
back
presently
the
story
was
this
a
friend
of
colonel
ashby
the
colonel
of
his
regiment
to
be
exact
was
an
earnest
student
of
everything
in
the
literature
of
the
country
that
dealt
with
sport
this
gentleman
happened
to
read
in
a
publisher
list
one
day
that
a
limited
edition
of
dark
by
a
mr
arthur
james
was
on
sale
and
might
be
purchased
from
the
publisher
by
all
who
were
willing
to
spend
half
a
guinea
to
that
end
old
matthews
said
the
colonel
off
for
this
book
thought
it
must
be
a
sporting
novel
do
you
know
i
shall
never
forget
his
disappointment
when
he
opened
the
parcel
it
turned
out
to
be
a
collection
of
poems
dark
horse
and
other
studies
in
the
was
its
full
title
never
had
a
soul
for
poetry
good
or
bad
dark
itself
was
about
a
knight
in
the
middle
ages
you
know
great
nonsense
it
was
too
matthews
used
to
read
me
passages
from
time
to
time
when
he
gave
up
the
regiment
he
left
me
the
book
as
a
farewell
gift
he
said
i
was
the
only
man
he
knew
who
really
sympathized
with
him
in
the
affair
i
got
it
still
it
in
the
library
somewhere
if
you
care
to
look
at
it
what
recalled
it
to
my
mind
was
your
mention
of
dido
the
second
poem
was
about
the
death
of
dido
as
far
as
i
can
remember
i
no
judge
of
poetry
but
it
did
strike
me
as
being
very
good
at
the
same
time
you
might
pick
up
a
hint
or
two
from
it
it
ought
to
be
in
one
of
the
two
lower
shelves
on
the
right
of
the
door
as
you
go
in
unless
it
has
been
taken
away
that
is
not
likely
though
we
are
not
very
enthusiastic
poetry
readers
here
pringle
thanked
him
for
his
information
and
went
back
to
the
where
he
lost
the
fourth
test
match
by
sixteen
runs
owing
to
preoccupation
you
ca
play
a
yorker
on
the
with
a
thin
if
your
mind
is
occupied
elsewhere
and
the
yorkers
of
james
the
elder
by
a
minute
of
the
two
ashbys
were
achieving
a
growing
reputation
in
charchester
cricket
circles
one
ought
never
thought
pringle
to
despise
the
gifts
which
fortune
bestows
on
us
and
this
mention
of
an
actual
completed
poem
on
the
very
subject
which
was
in
his
mind
was
clearly
a
gift
of
fortune
how
much
better
it
would
be
to
read
thoughtfully
through
this
poem
and
quarry
out
a
set
of
verses
from
it
suitable
to
lorimer
needs
than
to
waste
his
in
trying
to
evolve
something
original
from
his
own
inner
consciousness
pringle
objected
strongly
to
any
unnecessary
waste
of
his
besides
the
best
poets
borrowed
virgil
did
it
tennyson
did
it
even
homer
we
have
it
on
the
authority
of
mr
kipling
when
he
smote
his
blooming
lyre
went
and
stole
what
he
thought
he
might
require
why
should
pringle
of
the
school
house
refuse
to
follow
in
such
illustrious
footsteps
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
guileful
james
delivered
his
insidious
yorker
and
the
dull
thud
of
the
tennis
ball
on
the
board
which
served
as
the
wicket
told
a
listening
world
that
charchester
had
won
the
fourth
test
match
and
that
the
scores
were
now
two
all
but
beckford
star
was
to
ascend
again
pringle
mind
was
made
up
he
would
read
the
printed
poem
that
very
night
and
before
retiring
to
rest
he
would
have
lorimer
verses
complete
and
ready
to
be
sent
in
for
judgement
to
the
examiner
but
for
the
present
he
would
dismiss
the
matter
from
his
mind
and
devote
himself
to
polishing
off
the
charchester
champions
in
the
fifth
and
final
test
match
and
in
this
he
was
successful
for
just
as
the
bell
rang
summoning
the
players
in
to
a
tea
a
sweet
forward
drive
from
his
crashed
against
the
end
wall
and
beckford
had
won
the
rubber
the
young
batsman
undefeated
to
the
last
reached
the
pavilion
said
pringle
getting
into
his
coat
prolonged
and
deafening
salvo
of
cheers
greeted
him
his
not
out
compiled
as
it
was
against
the
finest
bowling
charchester
could
produce
and
on
a
wicket
that
was
always
treacherous
there
a
brick
loose
at
the
top
end
was
an
effort
unique
in
its
heroism
on
said
the
defeated
team
you
have
fluked
a
win
said
james
nothing
much
wait
till
next
visiting
sunday
and
the
teams
went
in
to
tea
in
the
programme
which
pringle
had
mapped
out
for
himself
he
was
to
go
to
bed
with
his
book
at
the
highly
respectable
hour
of
ten
work
till
eleven
and
then
go
to
sleep
but
programmes
are
notoriously
subject
to
alterations
pringle
was
altered
owing
to
a
remark
made
immediately
after
dinner
by
john
ashby
who
desirous
of
retrieving
the
fallen
fortunes
of
charchester
offered
to
play
pringle
a
hundred
up
at
billiards
giving
him
thirty
now
pringle
ability
in
the
realm
of
sport
did
not
extend
to
billiards
but
the
human
being
who
can
hear
unmoved
a
fellow
human
being
offering
him
thirty
start
in
a
game
of
a
hundred
has
yet
to
be
born
he
accepted
the
challenge
and
permission
to
play
having
been
granted
by
the
powers
that
were
on
the
understanding
that
the
cloth
was
not
to
be
cut
and
as
few
cues
broken
as
possible
the
game
began
james
acting
as
marker
there
are
doubtless
ways
by
which
a
game
of
a
hundred
up
can
be
got
through
in
less
than
two
hours
but
with
pringle
and
his
opponent
desire
outran
performance
when
the
highest
break
on
either
side
is
six
and
the
average
break
two
matters
progress
with
more
stateliness
than
speed
at
last
when
the
hands
of
the
clock
both
pointed
to
the
figure
eleven
pringle
whose
score
had
been
at
since
ten
found
himself
within
two
inches
of
his
opponent
ball
which
was
tottering
on
the
very
edge
of
the
pocket
he
administered
the
de
with
the
air
of
a
john
roberts
and
retired
triumphant
while
the
charchester
representatives
pointed
out
that
as
their
score
was
at
they
had
really
won
a
moral
victory
by
four
points
to
which
specious
and
unsportsmanlike
piece
of
sophistry
pringle
turned
a
deaf
ear
it
was
now
too
late
for
any
serious
literary
efforts
no
bard
can
do
without
his
sleep
even
homer
used
to
nod
at
times
so
pringle
contented
himself
with
reading
through
the
poem
which
consisted
of
some
thirty
lines
and
copying
the
same
down
on
a
sheet
of
notepaper
for
future
reference
after
which
he
went
to
bed
in
order
to
arrive
at
beckford
in
time
for
morning
school
he
had
to
start
from
the
house
at
eight
punctually
this
left
little
time
for
poetical
lights
the
consequence
was
that
when
lorimer
on
the
following
afternoon
demanded
the
poem
as
per
contract
all
that
pringle
had
to
show
was
the
copy
which
he
had
made
of
the
poem
in
the
book
there
was
a
moment
suspense
while
conscience
and
sheer
wickedness
fought
the
matter
out
inside
him
and
then
conscience
which
had
started
on
the
encounter
without
enthusiasm
being
obviously
flabby
and
out
of
condition
threw
up
the
sponge
you
are
said
pringle
only
a
rough
copy
but
here
it
lorimer
perused
it
hastily
i
say
he
observed
in
surprised
and
awestruck
tones
is
rather
good
it
seemed
to
strike
him
as
quite
a
novel
idea
not
bad
is
it
it
get
the
prize
we
shall
have
to
prevent
that
somehow
he
did
not
mention
how
and
lorimer
did
not
ask
anyhow
said
lorimer
awfully
i
hope
you
not
fagged
about
it
too
much
no
said
pringle
airily
not
it
been
no
trouble
at
all
he
thus
it
will
be
noticed
concluded
a
painful
and
immoral
scene
by
speaking
perfect
truth
a
most
gratifying
reflection
the
undersigned
norris
kept
his
word
with
regard
to
the
bishop
exclusion
from
the
eleven
the
team
which
had
beaten
the
had
not
had
the
benefit
of
his
assistance
lorimer
appearing
in
his
stead
lorimer
was
a
fast
bowler
deadly
in
house
matches
or
on
a
very
bad
wicket
he
was
the
mainstay
of
the
second
eleven
attack
and
in
an
ordinary
year
would
have
been
certain
of
his
first
eleven
cap
this
season
however
with
gosling
baynes
and
the
bishop
the
school
had
been
unusually
strong
and
lorimer
had
had
to
wait
the
of
his
name
on
the
came
as
no
surprise
to
gethryn
he
had
had
the
advantage
of
listening
to
norris
views
on
the
subject
but
when
marriott
grasped
the
facts
of
the
case
he
went
to
norris
and
raved
norris
as
is
right
and
proper
in
the
captain
of
a
school
team
when
the
wisdom
of
his
actions
is
called
into
question
treated
him
with
no
respect
whatever
no
good
talking
he
said
when
marriott
had
finished
a
brisk
opening
speech
know
perfectly
well
what
i
doing
there
no
excuse
for
you
at
all
said
marriott
you
were
mad
or
delirious
i
could
understand
it
and
have
an
ice
said
norris
snorted
marriott
the
good
of
standing
there
babbling
about
ices
do
you
know
we
have
beaten
the
for
four
years
shall
beat
them
this
year
without
gethryn
certainly
sha
beat
them
with
gethryn
because
he
not
going
to
play
a
chap
who
chooses
the
day
of
the
match
to
go
off
for
the
afternoon
and
then
refuses
to
explain
can
consider
himself
jolly
well
chucked
until
further
notice
feel
ready
for
that
ice
yet
be
an
ass
if
ever
you
do
get
any
ice
take
my
tip
and
tie
it
carefully
round
your
head
in
a
handkerchief
then
perhaps
you
be
able
to
see
why
gethryn
is
playing
against
the
on
saturday
and
marriott
went
off
raging
and
did
not
recover
until
late
in
the
afternoon
when
he
made
in
an
hour
for
leicester
house
in
a
scratch
game
there
were
only
three
of
the
eleven
houses
whose
occupants
seriously
expected
to
see
the
house
cricket
cup
on
the
mantelpiece
of
their
at
the
end
of
the
season
these
were
the
school
house
jephson
and
leicester
in
view
of
pringle
sensational
feats
throughout
the
term
the
knowing
ones
thought
that
the
cup
would
go
to
the
school
house
with
leicester
the
various
members
of
the
first
eleven
were
pretty
evenly
distributed
throughout
the
three
houses
leicester
had
gethryn
reece
and
marriott
jephson
relied
on
norris
bruce
and
baker
the
school
house
trump
card
was
pringle
with
lorimer
and
baynes
to
do
the
bowling
and
hill
of
the
first
eleven
and
kynaston
and
langdale
of
the
second
to
back
him
up
in
the
batting
department
both
the
other
first
eleven
men
were
day
boys
the
presence
of
gosling
in
any
of
the
house
elevens
however
weak
on
paper
would
have
lent
additional
interest
to
the
fight
for
the
cup
for
in
house
matches
where
every
team
has
more
or
less
of
a
tail
one
really
good
fast
bowler
can
make
a
surprising
amount
of
difference
to
a
side
there
was
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
the
school
about
the
house
cup
the
keenest
of
all
games
at
big
schools
are
generally
the
house
matches
when
beckford
met
charchester
or
any
of
the
four
schools
which
it
played
at
cricket
and
football
keenness
reached
its
highest
pitch
but
next
to
these
came
the
house
matches
now
that
he
no
longer
played
for
the
eleven
the
bishop
was
able
to
give
his
whole
mind
to
training
the
house
team
in
the
way
it
should
go
exclusion
from
the
first
eleven
meant
also
that
he
could
no
longer
unless
possessed
of
an
amount
of
so
colossal
as
almost
to
amount
to
genius
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
first
eleven
net
under
these
circumstances
leicester
net
summoned
him
like
mr
phil
may
lady
when
she
was
ejected
with
perfect
justice
by
a
barman
he
went
somewhere
where
he
would
be
respected
to
the
house
then
he
devoted
himself
and
scratch
games
and
became
the
order
of
the
day
house
fielding
before
breakfast
is
one
of
the
things
which
can
not
be
classed
under
the
head
of
the
lighter
side
of
cricket
you
get
up
in
the
small
hours
dragged
from
a
comfortable
bed
by
some
sportsman
who
you
feel
carries
enthusiasm
to
a
point
where
it
ceases
to
be
a
virtue
and
becomes
a
nuisance
you
get
into
flannels
and
still
half
asleep
stagger
off
to
the
field
where
a
hired
ruffian
hits
you
up
catches
which
bite
like
serpents
and
sting
like
adders
from
time
to
time
he
adds
insult
to
injury
by
shouting
to
to
a
remark
which
finds
but
one
parallel
in
the
language
the
of
the
football
captain
altogether
there
are
many
more
pleasant
occupations
than
early
morning
and
it
requires
a
considerable
amount
of
keenness
to
carry
the
victim
through
them
without
hopelessly
souring
his
nature
and
causing
him
to
foster
uncharitable
thoughts
towards
his
house
captain
monk
of
leicester
found
this
increased
activity
decidedly
uncongenial
he
had
no
real
patriotism
in
him
he
played
cricket
well
but
he
played
entirely
for
himself
if
for
instance
he
happened
to
make
fifty
in
a
match
and
it
happened
fairly
frequently
he
vastly
preferred
that
the
rest
of
the
side
should
make
ten
between
them
than
that
there
should
be
any
more
on
the
score
sheet
even
at
the
expense
of
losing
the
match
it
was
not
likely
therefore
that
he
would
take
kindly
to
this
mortification
of
the
flesh
the
sole
object
of
which
was
to
make
everybody
as
conspicuous
as
everybody
else
besides
in
the
matter
of
fielding
he
considered
that
he
had
nothing
to
learn
which
as
euclid
would
say
was
absurd
fielding
is
one
of
the
things
which
is
never
perfect
monk
moreover
had
another
reason
for
disliking
the
gethryn
as
captain
of
the
house
team
was
naturally
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
monk
objected
to
gethryn
for
this
dislike
he
had
solid
reasons
about
a
fortnight
after
the
commencement
of
term
the
bishop
going
downstairs
from
his
study
one
afternoon
was
aware
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
species
of
free
fight
going
on
in
the
doorway
of
the
senior
the
senior
was
where
the
rowdy
element
of
the
house
collected
the
individuals
who
were
too
old
to
be
fags
and
too
low
down
in
the
school
to
own
studies
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
bishop
would
probably
have
passed
on
without
investigating
the
matter
a
head
of
a
house
hates
above
all
things
to
get
a
name
for
not
minding
his
own
business
in
unimportant
matters
such
a
reputation
tells
against
him
when
he
has
to
put
his
foot
down
over
big
things
to
have
invaded
the
senior
and
stopped
a
conventional
senior
would
have
been
interfering
with
the
most
cherished
rights
of
the
citizens
the
freedom
which
is
the
birthright
of
every
englishman
so
to
speak
but
as
he
passed
the
door
which
had
just
shut
with
a
bang
behind
the
free
fighters
he
heard
monk
voice
inside
and
immediately
afterwards
the
voice
of
danvers
and
he
stopped
in
the
first
place
he
reasoned
within
himself
if
monk
and
danvers
were
doing
anything
it
was
probably
something
wrong
and
ought
to
be
stopped
gethryn
always
had
the
feeling
that
it
was
his
duty
to
go
and
see
what
monk
and
danvers
were
doing
and
tell
them
they
must
he
had
a
profound
belief
in
their
irreclaimable
villainy
in
the
second
place
having
studies
of
their
own
they
had
no
business
to
be
in
the
senior
at
all
it
was
contrary
to
the
etiquette
of
the
house
for
a
study
man
to
enter
the
senior
and
as
a
rule
the
senior
resented
it
as
to
all
appearances
they
were
not
resenting
it
now
the
obvious
conclusion
was
that
something
was
going
on
which
ought
to
cease
the
bishop
opened
the
door
etiquette
did
not
compel
the
head
of
the
house
to
knock
the
rule
being
that
you
knocked
only
at
the
doors
of
those
senior
to
you
in
the
house
he
was
consequently
enabled
to
witness
a
tableau
which
if
warning
had
been
received
of
his
coming
would
possibly
have
broken
up
before
he
entered
in
the
centre
of
the
group
was
wilson
leaning
over
the
study
table
not
so
much
as
if
he
liked
so
leaning
as
because
he
was
held
in
that
position
by
danvers
in
the
background
stood
monk
armed
with
a
round
the
walls
were
various
ornaments
of
the
senior
in
attitudes
of
expectant
attention
being
evidently
content
to
play
the
part
of
and
retainers
leaving
the
leading
parts
in
the
hands
of
monk
and
his
colleague
said
the
bishop
going
on
all
right
old
chap
said
monk
grinning
genially
only
having
an
execution
the
row
said
the
bishop
wilson
been
doing
broke
in
that
youth
who
had
wriggled
free
from
clutches
have
done
a
thing
gethryn
these
beasts
lugged
me
out
of
the
junior
without
saying
what
for
or
anything
the
bishop
began
to
look
dangerous
this
had
all
the
outward
aspect
of
a
case
of
bullying
under
reynolds
leadership
leicester
had
gone
in
rather
extensively
for
bullying
and
the
bishop
had
waited
hungrily
for
a
chance
of
catching
somebody
actively
engaged
in
the
sport
so
that
he
might
drop
heavily
on
that
person
and
make
life
unpleasant
for
him
he
said
turning
to
monk
have
it
what
was
it
all
about
and
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
it
monk
began
to
shuffle
it
was
nothing
much
he
said
what
are
you
doing
with
the
stick
pursued
the
bishop
relentlessly
wilson
cheeked
perkins
said
monk
murmurs
of
approval
from
the
senior
perkins
was
one
of
the
ornaments
referred
to
above
asked
gethryn
wilson
dashed
into
the
conversation
again
told
me
to
go
and
get
him
some
grub
from
the
shop
i
was
doing
some
work
so
i
could
besides
i
not
his
fag
if
perkins
wants
to
go
for
me
why
does
he
do
it
himself
and
not
get
about
a
hundred
fellows
to
help
him
said
the
bishop
very
sensible
suggestion
perkins
fall
upon
wilson
and
slay
him
i
see
fair
play
go
ahead
no
said
perkins
uneasily
he
was
a
small
youth
not
built
for
fighting
except
by
proxy
and
he
remembered
the
episode
of
wilson
and
skinner
the
thing
finished
said
gethryn
walks
over
we
need
detain
you
wilson
wilson
departed
with
all
the
honours
of
war
and
the
bishop
turned
to
monk
perhaps
you
tell
me
he
said
the
deuce
you
and
danvers
are
doing
here
hang
it
all
old
chap
the
bishop
begged
that
monk
would
not
call
him
chap
call
you
sir
if
you
like
said
monk
a
gleam
of
hope
appeared
in
the
bishop
eye
monk
was
going
to
give
him
the
opportunity
he
had
long
sighed
for
in
cold
blood
he
could
attack
no
one
not
even
monk
but
if
he
was
going
to
be
rude
that
altered
matters
business
have
you
in
the
he
said
got
studies
of
your
own
it
comes
to
that
said
monk
have
you
we
got
as
much
business
here
as
you
what
the
deuce
are
you
doing
here
taken
by
itself
taken
neat
as
it
were
this
repartee
might
have
been
insufficient
to
act
as
a
but
by
a
merciful
dispensation
of
providence
the
senior
elected
to
laugh
at
the
remark
and
to
laugh
loudly
monk
also
laughed
not
however
for
long
the
next
moment
the
bishop
had
darted
in
knocked
his
feet
from
under
him
and
dragged
him
to
the
door
captain
kettle
himself
could
not
have
done
it
more
neatly
said
the
bishop
can
discuss
the
point
monk
got
up
looking
greener
than
usual
and
began
to
dust
his
clothes
talk
rot
he
said
ca
fight
a
prefect
this
of
course
the
bishop
had
known
all
along
what
he
had
intended
to
do
if
monk
had
kept
up
his
end
he
had
not
decided
when
he
embarked
upon
the
engagement
the
head
of
a
house
can
not
fight
with
his
inferiors
without
the
loss
of
a
good
deal
of
his
painfully
acquired
dignity
but
gethryn
knew
monk
and
he
had
felt
justified
in
risking
it
he
improved
the
shining
hour
with
an
excursus
on
the
subject
of
bullying
dispensed
a
few
general
threats
and
left
the
room
monk
had
perhaps
not
unnaturally
not
forgotten
the
incident
and
now
that
public
opinion
ran
strongly
against
gethryn
on
account
of
his
match
manoeuvres
he
acted
a
mass
meeting
of
the
mob
was
called
in
his
study
and
it
was
unanimously
voted
that
in
the
morning
were
undesirable
and
that
it
would
be
judicious
if
the
team
were
to
strike
now
as
the
mob
included
in
their
numbers
eight
of
the
house
eleven
their
opinions
on
the
subject
carried
weight
here
said
waterford
struck
with
a
brilliant
idea
tell
you
what
we
do
let
sign
a
refusing
to
play
in
the
house
matches
unless
gethryn
resigns
the
captaincy
and
the
stop
may
as
well
sign
in
alphabetical
order
said
monk
prudently
make
it
safer
the
idea
took
the
mob
fancy
the
was
drawn
up
and
signed
if
we
could
only
get
reece
suggested
danvers
no
good
asking
marriott
but
reece
might
sign
have
a
shot
at
any
rate
said
monk
and
a
deputation
consisting
of
danvers
waterford
and
monk
duly
waited
upon
reece
in
his
study
and
broached
the
project
to
him
leicester
house
team
goes
into
a
second
edition
reece
was
working
when
the
deputation
entered
he
looked
up
enquiringly
but
if
he
was
pleased
to
see
his
visitors
he
managed
to
conceal
the
fact
i
say
reece
began
monk
who
had
constituted
himself
spokesman
to
the
expedition
you
busy
said
reece
simply
going
on
with
his
writing
this
might
have
discouraged
some
people
but
nature
had
equipped
monk
with
a
tough
skin
which
hints
never
pierced
he
dropped
into
a
chair
crossed
his
legs
and
coughed
danvers
and
waterford
leaned
in
picturesque
attitudes
against
the
door
and
mantelpiece
there
was
a
silence
for
a
minute
during
which
reece
continued
to
write
unmoved
a
seat
monk
he
said
at
last
without
looking
up
er
thanks
i
have
said
monk
say
reece
we
wanted
to
speak
to
you
ahead
then
said
reece
can
listen
and
write
at
the
same
time
i
doing
this
prose
against
time
about
gethryn
gethryn
been
doing
i
do
know
nothing
special
it
about
his
being
captain
of
the
house
team
the
chaps
seem
to
think
he
ought
to
resign
chaps
enquired
reece
laying
down
his
pen
and
turning
round
in
his
chair
rest
of
the
team
you
know
do
they
think
he
ought
to
be
captain
the
head
of
the
house
is
always
captain
of
the
house
team
unless
he
too
bad
to
be
in
it
at
all
do
the
chaps
think
gethryn
good
at
cricket
he
good
enough
said
monk
more
about
this
match
business
you
know
his
cutting
off
like
that
in
the
middle
of
the
match
the
chaps
think
the
house
ought
to
take
some
notice
of
it
express
its
disapproval
and
that
sort
of
thing
what
do
the
chaps
think
of
doing
about
it
monk
inserted
a
hand
in
his
and
drew
forth
the
he
straightened
it
out
and
passed
it
over
to
reece
drawn
up
this
notice
he
said
we
came
to
see
if
sign
it
nearly
all
the
other
chaps
in
the
team
have
reece
perused
the
document
gravely
then
he
handed
it
back
to
its
owner
rot
said
he
do
think
so
at
all
said
monk
do
i
broke
in
danvers
speaking
for
the
first
time
else
can
we
do
we
ca
let
a
chap
like
gethryn
stick
to
the
captaincy
not
cad
like
that
a
matter
of
opinion
i
do
suppose
everyone
thinks
him
a
cad
i
do
personally
anyway
asked
waterford
you
going
to
sign
good
man
of
course
i
not
do
you
mean
to
say
you
seriously
intend
to
hand
in
that
piffle
to
gethryn
said
monk
you
be
making
fools
of
yourselves
i
tell
you
exactly
what
happen
if
you
care
to
know
gethryn
will
read
this
rot
and
simply
cut
everybody
whose
name
appears
on
the
list
out
of
the
house
team
i
do
know
if
you
aware
of
it
but
there
are
several
other
fellows
besides
you
in
the
house
and
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
you
are
so
awfully
good
you
three
are
in
the
second
the
other
five
have
got
colours
at
all
we
all
in
the
house
team
said
monk
let
that
worry
you
said
reece
wo
be
long
if
you
show
gethryn
that
interesting
document
anything
else
i
can
do
for
you
thanks
said
monk
and
the
deputation
retired
when
they
had
gone
reece
made
his
way
to
the
bishop
study
it
was
not
likely
that
the
deputation
would
deliver
their
ultimatum
until
late
at
night
when
the
study
would
be
empty
from
what
reece
knew
of
monk
he
judged
that
it
would
be
pleasanter
to
him
to
leave
the
document
where
the
bishop
could
find
it
in
the
morning
rather
than
run
the
risks
that
might
attend
a
personal
interview
there
was
time
therefore
to
let
gethryn
know
what
was
going
to
happen
so
that
he
might
not
be
surprised
into
doing
anything
rash
such
as
resigning
the
captaincy
for
example
not
that
reece
thought
it
likely
that
he
would
but
it
was
better
to
take
no
risks
both
marriott
and
gethryn
were
in
the
study
when
he
arrived
reece
said
marriott
in
and
take
several
seats
have
a
biscuit
have
two
have
a
good
many
reece
helped
himself
and
gave
them
a
brief
description
of
the
late
interview
not
surprised
said
gethryn
thought
monk
would
be
getting
at
me
somehow
soon
i
shall
to
slay
that
chap
someday
what
ought
i
to
do
do
you
think
dear
chap
said
marriott
only
one
thing
you
can
do
cut
the
lot
of
them
out
of
the
team
and
fill
up
with
substitutes
reece
nodded
approval
course
that
what
you
must
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
told
them
you
would
i
given
you
a
reputation
you
must
live
up
to
it
continued
marriott
all
it
is
such
a
crusher
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
only
four
of
them
are
really
certainties
for
their
places
monk
danvers
waterford
and
saunders
the
rest
are
simply
tail
reece
nodded
again
minds
think
alike
exactly
what
i
told
them
only
they
would
listen
whom
do
you
suggest
instead
of
them
some
of
the
kids
are
jolly
keen
and
all
that
but
they
would
be
much
good
against
baynes
and
lorimer
for
instance
i
were
you
said
marriott
should
think
about
their
batting
at
all
i
should
go
simply
for
fielding
with
a
good
fielding
side
we
ought
to
have
quite
a
decent
chance
there
no
earthly
reason
why
you
and
reece
should
put
on
enough
for
the
first
wicket
to
win
all
the
matches
it
been
done
before
do
you
remember
the
school
house
getting
the
cup
four
years
ago
when
twiss
was
captain
they
had
nobody
who
was
any
earthly
good
except
twiss
and
birch
and
those
two
used
to
make
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
between
them
in
every
match
besides
some
of
the
kids
can
bat
rather
well
wilson
for
one
he
can
bowl
too
said
the
bishop
right
stick
down
wilson
who
else
gregson
is
bad
he
can
field
in
the
slips
which
is
more
than
a
good
many
chaps
can
good
said
reece
him
down
that
makes
five
you
might
have
young
lee
in
too
i
seen
him
play
like
a
book
at
his
form
net
once
or
twice
six
five
more
wanted
where
a
house
list
here
we
are
now
adams
bond
brown
burgess
burgess
has
his
points
shall
i
stick
him
down
presume
to
dictate
said
marriott
adams
is
streets
better
than
burgess
as
a
field
and
just
as
good
a
bat
when
have
you
seen
him
a
scratch
game
between
his
form
and
another
he
was
carting
all
over
the
shop
made
thirty
something
have
both
of
them
in
then
plenty
of
room
this
is
the
team
so
far
wilson
gregson
lee
adams
and
burgess
with
marriott
reece
and
gethryn
jolly
hot
stuff
it
is
too
by
jove
we
simply
walk
that
tankard
now
for
the
last
places
i
vote
we
each
select
a
man
and
nobody
allowed
to
appeal
against
the
other
decision
i
lead
off
with
crowinshaw
good
name
crowinshaw
look
well
on
a
score
sheet
us
the
list
said
marriott
my
dear
sir
there
only
one
man
in
the
running
at
all
which
his
name
chamberlain
shove
down
joseph
and
do
let
me
hear
anyone
breathe
a
word
against
him
come
on
reece
let
have
your
man
i
bet
reece
selects
some
weird
rotter
reece
pondered
he
said
my
very
dear
sir
carstairs
criticism
barred
said
the
bishop
by
the
way
what
house
are
we
drawn
against
in
the
first
round
we
can
smash
webster
they
got
nobody
it
be
rather
a
good
thing
having
an
easy
time
in
our
first
game
we
shall
be
able
to
get
some
idea
about
the
team
play
i
should
think
we
could
possibly
get
beaten
by
webster
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
wilson
came
in
with
a
request
that
he
might
fetch
a
book
that
he
had
left
in
the
study
wilson
just
the
man
i
wanted
to
see
said
the
bishop
you
playing
against
webster
next
week
jove
said
wilson
i
really
he
had
spent
days
in
working
out
on
little
slips
of
paper
during
school
his
exact
chances
of
getting
a
place
in
the
house
team
recently
however
he
had
almost
ceased
to
hope
he
had
reckoned
on
at
least
eight
of
the
senior
study
being
chosen
before
him
said
the
bishop
must
buck
up
practise
fielding
every
minute
of
your
spare
time
anybody
hit
you
up
catches
if
you
ask
them
said
wilson
will
right
then
go
and
tell
lee
that
i
want
to
see
him
said
the
bishop
when
that
worthy
appeared
wanted
to
see
you
to
tell
you
you
playing
for
the
house
against
webster
thought
you
might
like
to
know
jove
said
lee
i
really
buck
up
with
your
fielding
said
lee
all
if
you
going
downstairs
you
might
tell
adams
to
come
up
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
bishop
interviewed
the
junior
members
of
his
team
and
impressed
on
each
of
them
the
absolute
necessity
of
bucking
up
with
his
fielding
and
each
of
them
protested
that
the
matter
should
receive
his
best
consideration
they
keen
enough
anyway
said
marriott
as
the
door
closed
behind
carstairs
the
last
of
the
new
recruits
that
the
great
thing
hullo
who
that
i
thought
you
had
worked
through
the
lot
come
in
a
small
form
appeared
in
the
doorway
carrying
in
its
right
hand
a
note
told
me
to
give
you
this
gethryn
a
second
said
the
bishop
as
the
youth
made
for
the
door
may
be
an
answer
said
there
would
be
one
no
it
all
right
there
is
an
answer
the
door
closed
the
bishop
laughed
and
threw
the
note
over
to
reece
it
reece
examined
the
paper
a
fair
copy
the
one
monk
showed
me
was
rather
smudged
i
suppose
they
thought
you
might
be
hurt
if
you
got
an
inky
considerate
chap
monk
have
a
look
said
marriott
jove
i
say
listen
to
this
bit
like
macaulay
is
it
he
read
extracts
from
the
ultimatum
have
it
said
gethryn
stretching
out
a
hand
much
i
going
to
keep
it
and
have
it
framed
right
i
going
down
now
to
put
up
the
list
when
he
had
returned
to
the
study
monk
and
danvers
came
quietly
downstairs
to
look
at
the
it
was
dark
in
the
passage
and
monk
had
to
strike
a
light
before
he
could
see
to
read
george
he
said
as
the
match
flared
up
was
right
he
has
there
one
consolation
commented
danvers
viciously
ca
possibly
get
that
cup
now
they
have
to
put
us
in
again
soon
you
see
if
they
do
yes
said
monk
doubtfully
norris
takes
a
short
holiday
all
rot
observed
pringle
say
that
they
have
a
chance
because
they
have
he
and
lorimer
were
passing
through
the
on
their
way
back
from
an
early
morning
visit
to
the
baths
and
had
stopped
to
look
at
leicester
house
team
revised
version
taking
its
daily
hour
of
fielding
practice
they
watched
the
performance
keenly
and
critically
as
spies
in
an
enemy
camp
said
they
had
a
chance
said
lorimer
did
everybody
the
chaps
call
them
the
kindergarten
and
the
happy
league
and
things
of
that
sort
rot
i
call
it
they
seem
to
forget
that
you
only
want
two
or
three
really
good
men
in
a
team
if
the
rest
can
field
look
at
our
crowd
they
all
either
got
their
colours
or
else
are
just
outside
the
teams
and
i
swear
you
ca
rely
on
one
of
them
to
hold
the
merest
sitter
right
into
his
hands
on
the
subject
of
fielding
in
general
and
catching
in
particular
pringle
was
feeling
rather
sore
in
the
match
which
his
house
had
just
won
against
browning
he
had
put
himself
on
to
bowl
in
the
second
innings
he
was
one
of
those
bowlers
who
manage
to
capture
from
six
to
ten
wickets
in
the
course
of
a
season
and
the
occasions
on
which
he
bowled
really
well
were
few
on
this
occasion
he
had
bowled
excellently
and
it
had
annoyed
him
when
five
catches
five
soft
gentle
catches
were
missed
off
him
in
the
course
of
four
overs
as
he
watched
the
crisp
clean
fielding
which
was
shown
by
the
very
smallest
of
leicester
small
he
felt
that
he
would
rather
have
any
of
that
despised
eight
on
his
side
than
any
of
the
school
house
lights
except
baynes
and
lorimer
lot
all
right
really
said
lorimer
in
answer
to
sweeping
condemnation
has
his
off
days
they
be
all
right
next
match
it
replied
pringle
all
very
well
for
you
you
bowl
to
hit
the
sticks
i
do
now
just
watch
these
kids
for
a
moment
now
look
no
he
could
have
got
to
that
wait
a
second
now
gethryn
had
skied
one
into
the
deep
wilson
burgess
and
carstairs
all
started
for
it
called
the
bishop
the
other
two
stopped
dead
burgess
ran
on
and
made
the
catch
there
you
are
said
pringle
pointing
his
moral
how
those
two
kids
stopped
when
gethryn
called
if
that
had
happened
in
one
of
our
matches
you
have
had
half
a
dozen
men
rotting
about
underneath
the
ball
and
getting
in
one
another
way
and
then
probably
winding
up
by
everybody
leaving
the
catch
to
everybody
else
come
on
said
lorimer
getting
morbid
why
the
dickens
did
you
think
of
having
our
fellows
out
for
fielding
practice
if
you
so
keen
on
it
would
have
come
when
a
chap
gets
colours
he
seems
to
think
he
bought
the
place
you
ca
drag
a
second
eleven
man
out
of
his
bed
before
breakfast
to
improve
his
fielding
he
thinks
it
ca
be
improved
they
a
crew
said
lorimer
suppose
that
includes
me
you
a
model
man
i
have
seen
you
hold
a
catch
now
and
then
oh
i
say
i
gave
in
the
poem
yesterday
i
hope
the
deuce
it
wo
get
the
prize
i
hope
they
wo
spot
either
that
i
write
the
thing
a
chance
said
pringle
complacently
all
right
do
you
worry
yourself
webster
against
whom
leicester
had
been
drawn
in
the
opening
round
of
the
house
matches
had
three
men
in
their
team
and
only
three
who
knew
how
to
hold
a
bat
it
was
the
slackest
house
in
the
school
and
always
had
been
it
did
not
cause
any
overwhelming
surprise
accordingly
when
leicester
beat
them
without
fatigue
by
an
innings
and
a
hundred
and
runs
webster
won
the
toss
and
made
for
leicester
reece
and
gethryn
scored
fifty
and
respectively
and
marriott
not
out
they
then
with
two
wickets
down
declared
and
rattled
webster
out
for
seventy
the
public
which
had
had
its
eye
on
the
team
in
order
to
see
how
its
tail
was
likely
to
shape
was
disappointed
the
only
definite
fact
that
could
be
gleaned
from
the
match
was
that
the
junior
members
of
the
team
were
not
to
be
despised
in
the
field
the
early
morning
had
had
their
effect
adams
especially
shone
while
wilson
at
cover
and
burgess
in
the
deep
recalled
jessop
and
tyldesley
the
school
made
a
note
of
the
fact
so
did
the
bishop
he
summoned
the
eight
juniors
to
his
study
and
administered
much
praise
coupled
with
the
news
that
fielding
before
breakfast
would
go
on
as
usual
leicester
had
drawn
against
jephson
in
the
second
round
lot
had
beaten
cooke
by
curiously
enough
almost
exactly
the
same
margin
as
that
by
which
leicester
had
defeated
webster
it
was
generally
considered
that
this
match
would
decide
leicester
chances
for
the
cup
if
they
could
beat
a
really
hot
team
like
jephson
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
would
do
the
same
to
the
rest
of
the
houses
though
the
school
house
would
have
to
be
reckoned
with
but
the
school
house
as
pringle
had
observed
was
weak
in
the
field
it
was
not
a
coherent
team
individually
its
members
were
good
but
they
did
not
play
together
as
leicester
did
but
the
majority
of
the
school
did
not
think
seriously
of
their
chances
except
for
pringle
who
as
has
been
mentioned
before
always
made
a
point
of
thinking
differently
from
everyone
else
no
one
really
believed
that
they
would
win
the
cup
or
even
appear
in
the
final
how
could
a
team
whose
tail
began
at
the
fall
of
the
second
wicket
defeat
teams
which
like
the
school
house
had
no
real
tail
at
all
norris
supported
this
view
it
was
for
this
reason
that
when
at
breakfast
on
the
day
on
which
jephson
were
due
to
play
leicester
he
received
an
invitation
from
one
of
his
many
uncles
to
spend
a
weekend
at
his
house
he
decided
to
accept
it
this
uncle
was
a
man
of
wealth
after
winning
two
fortunes
on
the
stock
exchange
and
losing
them
both
he
had
at
length
amassed
a
third
with
which
he
retired
in
triumph
to
the
country
leaving
throgmorton
street
to
exist
as
best
it
could
without
him
he
had
bought
a
at
a
village
which
lay
twenty
miles
by
rail
to
the
east
of
beckford
and
it
had
always
been
norris
wish
to
see
this
a
house
which
was
said
to
combine
the
hoariest
of
antiquity
with
a
variety
of
modern
comforts
merely
to
pay
a
flying
visit
there
would
be
good
but
his
uncle
held
out
an
additional
attraction
if
norris
could
catch
the
from
horton
he
would
arrive
just
in
time
to
take
part
in
a
cricket
match
that
day
being
the
day
of
the
annual
encounter
with
the
neighbouring
village
of
pudford
the
rector
of
pudford
the
opposition
captain
so
wrote
norris
uncle
had
by
underhand
means
lured
down
three
really
decent
players
from
oxford
not
blues
but
almost
who
had
come
to
the
village
ostensibly
to
read
classics
with
him
as
their
coach
but
in
reality
for
the
sole
purpose
of
snatching
from
little
bindlebury
his
own
village
the
laurels
they
had
so
nobly
earned
the
year
before
he
had
heard
that
norris
was
captaining
the
beckford
team
this
year
and
had
an
average
of
point
nought
three
two
so
would
he
come
and
make
point
nought
three
two
for
little
bindlebury
thought
norris
fame
this
is
where
i
spread
myself
i
must
be
in
this
at
any
price
he
showed
the
letter
to
baker
a
pity
said
baker
a
pity
you
wo
be
able
to
go
it
seems
rather
a
catch
go
said
norris
dear
sir
you
talking
through
your
hat
think
i
going
to
refuse
an
invitation
like
this
not
if
i
know
it
i
going
to
toddle
off
to
jephson
get
an
exeat
and
catch
that
and
if
i
do
paralyse
the
pudford
bowling
i
shoot
myself
the
house
match
leicester
this
afternoon
gurgled
the
amazed
baker
hang
leicester
surely
the
rest
of
you
can
lick
the
kids
happy
league
without
my
help
if
you
ca
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
i
chosen
you
a
wicket
with
my
own
hands
fit
to
play
a
test
match
on
course
we
ought
to
lick
them
but
you
can
never
tell
at
cricket
what
going
to
happen
we
ought
to
run
any
risks
when
we
got
such
a
good
chance
of
winning
the
pot
why
it
centuries
since
we
won
the
pot
do
you
go
must
man
it
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
baker
tried
another
method
of
attack
he
said
do
suppose
jephson
let
you
off
to
play
in
a
beastly
little
village
game
when
there
a
house
match
on
must
never
know
hissed
norris
after
the
manner
of
the
villain
certain
to
ask
why
you
want
to
get
off
so
early
shall
tell
him
my
uncle
particularly
wishes
me
to
come
early
he
asks
why
shall
say
i
ca
possibly
imagine
well
if
you
going
to
tell
lies
at
all
merely
a
diplomatic
evasion
i
not
bound
to
go
and
sob
out
my
secrets
on
jephson
waistcoat
baker
gave
up
the
struggle
with
a
sniff
norris
went
to
mr
jephson
and
got
leave
to
spend
the
at
his
uncle
the
interview
went
without
a
hitch
as
norris
had
prophesied
will
miss
the
house
match
norris
then
said
mr
jephson
afraid
so
sir
but
mr
leicester
are
very
weak
reece
marriott
and
gethryn
are
a
good
beginning
sir
but
they
got
nobody
else
their
tail
starts
after
those
three
well
but
it
seems
a
pity
you
sir
said
norris
wisely
refraining
from
discussing
the
matter
he
had
got
his
exeat
which
was
what
he
had
come
for
in
all
the
annals
of
pudford
and
little
bindlebury
cricket
there
had
never
been
such
a
match
as
that
year
the
rector
of
pudford
and
his
three
oxford
experts
performed
prodigies
with
the
bat
prodigies
that
is
to
say
judged
from
the
standpoint
of
ordinary
pudford
scoring
where
double
figures
were
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
the
rector
an
elderly
gentleman
played
with
astounding
caution
and
still
more
remarkable
luck
for
seventeen
finally
after
he
had
been
in
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
accepted
the
eighth
easy
chance
offered
to
him
and
the
ecclesiastic
had
to
retire
the
three
men
knocked
up
a
hundred
between
them
and
the
complete
total
was
no
less
than
a
hundred
and
then
came
the
sensation
of
the
day
after
three
wickets
had
fallen
for
ten
runs
norris
and
the
little
bindlebury
curate
an
old
cantab
stayed
together
and
knocked
off
the
deficit
norris
contribution
of
not
out
was
for
many
a
day
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
over
the
evening
pewter
at
the
bindlebury
arms
a
who
tried
on
one
occasion
to
introduce
the
topic
of
farmer
giles
grey
pig
found
himself
the
most
unpopular
man
in
the
village
on
the
monday
morning
norris
returned
to
jephson
with
pride
in
his
heart
and
a
sovereign
in
his
pocket
the
latter
the
gift
of
his
excellent
uncle
he
had
had
he
freely
admitted
to
himself
a
good
time
his
uncle
had
done
him
well
exceedingly
well
and
he
looked
forward
to
going
to
the
again
in
the
near
future
in
the
meantime
he
felt
a
languid
desire
to
know
how
the
house
match
was
going
on
they
must
almost
have
finished
the
first
innings
he
thought
unless
jephson
had
run
up
a
very
big
score
and
kept
their
opponents
in
the
field
all
the
afternoon
baker
he
said
tramping
breezily
into
the
study
had
the
time
of
a
lifetime
great
simply
no
other
word
for
it
how
the
match
getting
on
baker
looked
up
from
the
book
he
was
reading
match
he
enquired
coldly
match
of
course
you
lunatic
what
match
did
you
think
i
meant
how
it
going
on
not
going
on
said
baker
stopped
need
be
a
funny
goat
said
norris
complainingly
know
what
i
mean
what
happened
on
saturday
won
the
toss
began
baker
slowly
went
in
and
made
a
hundred
and
twenty
i
told
you
they
were
no
use
a
hundred
and
twenty
rotten
we
went
in
and
made
and
just
a
simple
without
any
trimmings
of
any
sort
man
how
why
how
on
earth
did
it
happen
took
eight
for
nine
does
that
seem
to
make
it
any
clearer
for
nine
rot
you
the
if
you
care
to
see
it
in
the
second
innings
you
began
a
second
innings
we
also
finished
it
we
scored
rather
freely
in
the
second
innings
ten
was
on
the
board
before
the
fifth
wicket
fell
in
the
end
we
fairly
collared
the
bowling
and
ran
up
a
total
of
norris
took
a
seat
and
tried
to
grapple
with
the
situation
look
here
baker
swear
you
not
ragging
baker
took
a
green
from
the
shelf
and
passed
it
to
him
for
yourself
he
said
norris
looked
he
looked
long
and
earnestly
then
he
handed
the
book
back
they
won
he
said
blankly
do
you
guess
these
things
observed
baker
with
some
bitterness
you
are
a
crew
said
norris
out
for
and
i
see
gethryn
got
nine
for
thirty
in
the
second
innings
he
seems
to
have
been
on
the
spot
i
suppose
the
wicket
suited
him
you
can
call
it
a
wicket
next
time
you
specially
select
a
pitch
for
the
house
to
play
on
i
wish
you
hunt
up
something
with
some
slight
pretensions
to
decency
what
was
wrong
with
the
pitch
it
was
a
bit
worn
that
was
all
said
baker
call
having
holes
three
inches
deep
just
where
every
ball
pitches
being
a
bit
worn
i
suppose
it
was
anyhow
it
would
have
been
almost
as
well
do
you
think
if
you
stopped
and
played
for
the
house
instead
of
going
off
to
your
rotten
village
match
you
were
sick
enough
when
gethryn
went
off
in
the
match
curse
said
norris
for
he
had
been
hoping
against
hope
that
the
parallel
nature
of
the
two
incidents
would
be
less
apparent
to
other
people
than
it
was
to
himself
and
so
it
came
about
that
leicester
passed
successfully
through
the
first
two
rounds
and
soared
into
the
dizzy
heights
of
the
charchester
at
charchester
from
the
fact
that
he
had
left
his
team
so
basely
in
the
lurch
on
the
day
of
an
important
match
a
casual
observer
might
have
imagined
that
norris
did
not
really
care
very
much
whether
his
house
won
the
cup
or
not
but
this
was
not
the
case
in
reality
the
success
of
jephson
was
a
very
important
matter
to
him
a
sudden
whim
had
induced
him
to
accept
his
uncle
invitation
but
now
that
that
acceptance
had
had
such
disastrous
results
he
felt
inclined
to
hire
a
sturdy
menial
by
the
hour
to
kick
him
till
he
felt
better
to
a
person
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
there
are
three
methods
of
consolation
he
can
commit
suicide
he
can
take
to
drink
or
he
can
occupy
his
mind
with
other
matters
and
cure
himself
by
fixing
his
attention
steadily
on
some
object
and
devoting
his
whole
energies
to
the
acquisition
of
the
same
norris
chose
the
last
method
on
the
saturday
week
following
his
performance
for
little
bindlebury
the
beckford
eleven
was
due
to
journey
to
charchester
to
play
the
return
match
against
that
school
on
their
opponents
ground
and
norris
resolved
that
that
match
should
be
won
for
the
next
week
the
team
practised
assiduously
those
members
of
it
who
were
not
playing
in
house
matches
spending
every
afternoon
at
the
nets
the
treatment
was
not
without
its
effect
the
team
had
been
a
good
one
before
now
every
one
of
the
eleven
seemed
to
be
at
the
very
summit
of
his
powers
new
and
hitherto
unsuspected
strokes
began
to
be
developed
leg
glances
which
recalled
the
hove
and
ranjitsinhji
late
cuts
of
palairetical
brilliance
in
short
all
nature
may
be
said
to
have
smiled
and
by
the
end
of
the
week
norris
was
beginning
to
be
almost
cheerful
once
more
and
then
on
the
monday
before
the
match
samuel
wilberforce
gosling
came
to
school
with
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
norris
met
him
at
the
school
gates
rubbed
his
eyes
to
see
whether
it
was
not
after
all
some
horrid
optical
illusion
and
finally
when
the
stern
truth
came
home
to
him
almost
swooned
with
anguish
how
why
he
enquired
lucidly
the
injured
samuel
smiled
feebly
fearfully
sorry
norris
he
said
say
you
ca
play
on
saturday
moaned
norris
sorry
i
know
it
a
bit
of
a
sickener
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
really
the
doctor
says
i
sha
be
able
to
play
for
a
couple
of
weeks
now
that
the
blow
had
definitely
fallen
norris
was
sufficiently
himself
again
to
be
able
to
enquire
into
the
matter
on
earth
did
you
do
it
how
did
it
happen
gosling
looked
guiltier
than
ever
was
on
saturday
evening
he
said
were
ragging
about
at
home
a
bit
you
know
and
my
young
sister
wanted
me
to
send
her
down
a
few
balls
somebody
had
given
her
a
composition
bean
and
a
bat
and
been
awfully
keen
on
the
game
ever
since
she
got
them
think
it
simply
sickening
the
way
girls
want
to
do
everything
we
do
said
norris
disgustedly
gosling
spoke
for
the
defence
she
only
thirteen
you
ca
blame
the
kid
seemed
to
me
a
jolly
healthy
symptom
laudable
ambition
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
sent
down
one
or
two
she
played
like
a
book
bit
inclined
to
pull
all
girls
are
so
i
put
in
a
long
hop
on
the
off
and
she
let
go
at
it
like
jessop
she
got
a
rattling
stroke
in
direction
well
the
bean
came
whizzing
back
rather
wide
on
the
right
i
doubled
across
to
bring
off
a
beefy
and
the
bally
thing
took
me
right
on
the
tips
of
the
fingers
those
composition
balls
hurt
like
blazes
i
can
tell
you
smashed
my
second
finger
simply
into
hash
and
i
could
grip
a
ball
now
to
save
my
life
much
less
bowl
i
awfully
sorry
it
a
shocking
nuisance
norris
agreed
with
him
it
was
more
than
a
nuisance
it
was
a
staggerer
now
that
gethryn
no
longer
figured
for
the
first
eleven
gosling
was
the
school
one
hope
baynes
was
good
on
his
wicket
but
the
wickets
he
liked
were
the
variety
and
this
summer
fine
weather
had
set
in
early
and
continued
lorimer
was
also
useful
but
not
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
as
the
great
samuel
the
former
was
good
the
latter
would
be
good
in
a
year
or
so
his
proper
sphere
of
action
was
the
tail
if
the
first
pair
of
bowlers
could
dismiss
five
good
batsmen
lorimer
fast
straight
deliveries
usually
accounted
for
the
rest
but
there
had
to
be
somebody
to
pave
the
way
for
him
he
was
essentially
a
change
bowler
it
is
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
norris
very
soon
began
to
think
wistfully
of
the
bishop
who
was
just
now
doing
such
great
things
with
the
ball
wasting
his
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
of
the
house
matches
would
it
be
consistent
with
his
dignity
to
invite
him
back
into
the
team
it
was
a
nice
point
with
some
persons
there
might
be
a
risk
but
gethryn
as
he
knew
perfectly
well
was
not
the
sort
of
fellow
to
rub
in
the
undeniable
fact
that
the
school
team
could
not
get
along
without
him
he
had
half
decided
to
ask
him
to
play
against
charchester
when
gosling
suggested
the
very
same
thing
do
you
have
gethryn
in
again
he
said
stood
him
out
against
the
and
the
masters
surely
that
enough
especially
as
he
miles
the
best
bowler
in
the
school
yourself
a
bit
he
can
give
me
points
you
take
my
tip
and
put
him
in
again
he
play
if
i
put
him
down
because
you
know
i
dashed
if
i
going
to
do
any
grovelling
and
that
sort
of
thing
to
i
should
think
anyhow
it
worth
trying
pringle
on
being
consulted
gave
the
same
opinion
and
norris
was
convinced
the
list
went
up
that
afternoon
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
match
gethryn
name
appeared
in
its
usual
place
is
learning
wisdom
in
his
old
age
said
marriott
to
the
bishop
as
they
walked
over
to
the
house
that
evening
leicester
were
in
the
middle
of
their
and
looked
like
winning
it
was
just
wondering
what
to
do
about
it
said
gethryn
would
you
do
play
do
you
think
my
dear
man
what
else
did
you
propose
to
do
you
thinking
of
refusing
was
man
that
rank
treason
if
you
put
down
to
play
for
the
school
you
must
play
there
no
question
about
it
if
norris
knocked
you
down
with
one
hand
and
put
you
up
on
the
board
with
the
other
you
have
to
play
all
the
same
you
must
have
any
feelings
where
the
school
is
concerned
nobody
ever
refused
to
play
in
a
first
match
it
one
of
the
things
you
ca
do
norris
has
given
you
much
of
a
time
lately
i
admit
still
you
must
lump
that
excuse
sermon
i
hope
it
done
you
good
well
i
play
it
rather
rot
though
it
all
right
really
it
only
that
you
got
into
a
groove
you
so
used
to
doing
the
heavy
martyr
that
the
sudden
change
has
knocked
you
out
rather
come
and
have
an
ice
before
the
shop
shuts
so
gethryn
came
once
more
into
the
team
and
travelled
down
to
charchester
with
the
others
and
at
this
point
a
painful
alternative
faces
me
i
have
to
choose
between
truth
and
inclination
i
should
like
to
say
that
the
bishop
eclipsed
himself
and
broke
all
previous
records
in
the
charchester
match
by
the
rules
of
the
dramatic
nothing
else
is
possible
but
truth
though
it
crush
me
and
truth
compels
me
to
admit
that
his
performance
was
in
reality
distinctly
mediocre
one
of
his
weak
points
as
a
bowler
was
that
he
was
at
sea
when
opposed
to
a
many
bowlers
have
this
failing
some
strange
power
seems
to
compel
them
to
bowl
solely
on
the
leg
side
and
nothing
but
long
hops
and
full
pitches
it
was
so
in
the
case
of
gethryn
charchester
won
the
toss
and
batted
first
on
a
perfect
wicket
the
first
pair
of
batsmen
were
the
captain
a
great
bat
who
had
scored
not
out
against
beckford
in
the
previous
match
and
a
fiend
baynes
were
useless
on
a
wicket
which
from
the
hardness
of
it
might
have
been
constructed
of
asphalt
and
the
rubbish
the
bishop
rolled
up
to
the
artiste
was
painful
to
witness
at
four
the
match
had
started
at
eleven
the
charchester
captain
reached
his
century
and
was
almost
immediately
stumped
off
baynes
the
bishop
bowled
the
next
man
first
ball
the
one
bright
spot
in
his
afternoon
performance
then
came
another
long
stand
against
which
the
beckford
bowling
raged
in
vain
at
five
charchester
by
that
time
having
made
two
hundred
and
for
two
wickets
the
ran
into
three
figures
and
the
captain
promptly
declared
the
innings
closed
beckford
only
chance
was
to
play
for
a
draw
and
in
this
they
succeeded
when
stumps
were
drawn
at
a
quarter
to
seven
the
score
was
a
hundred
and
three
and
five
wickets
were
down
the
bishop
had
the
satisfaction
of
being
not
out
with
to
his
credit
but
nothing
less
than
a
century
would
have
been
sufficient
to
soothe
him
after
his
shocking
bowling
performance
pringle
who
during
the
luncheon
interval
had
encountered
his
young
friends
the
ashbys
and
had
been
duly
taunted
by
them
on
the
subject
of
was
top
scorer
with
norris
i
regret
to
say
only
made
three
running
himself
out
in
his
second
over
as
the
misfortune
could
not
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
be
laid
at
anybody
else
door
but
his
own
he
was
decidedly
savage
the
team
returned
to
beckford
rather
footsore
very
disgusted
and
abnormally
silent
norris
sulked
by
himself
at
one
end
of
the
saloon
carriage
and
the
bishop
sulked
by
himself
at
the
other
end
and
even
marriott
forbore
to
treat
the
situation
lightly
it
was
a
mournful
no
cheering
wildly
as
the
brake
drove
to
the
college
from
horton
no
shouting
of
the
school
song
in
various
keys
as
they
passed
through
the
big
gates
simply
silence
and
except
when
putting
him
on
to
bowl
or
taking
him
off
or
moving
him
in
the
field
norris
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
the
bishop
the
whole
afternoon
it
was
shortly
after
this
disaster
that
mr
mortimer
wells
came
to
stay
with
the
headmaster
mr
mortimer
wells
was
a
brilliant
and
superior
young
man
who
was
at
some
pains
to
be
a
cynic
he
was
an
old
pupil
of
the
head
in
the
days
before
he
had
succeeded
to
the
rule
of
beckford
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
scholar
and
to
him
had
been
deputed
the
task
of
judging
the
poetical
outbursts
of
the
bards
of
the
upper
fifth
with
the
object
of
awarding
to
the
most
deserving
or
perhaps
to
the
least
undeserving
the
handsome
prize
bequeathed
by
his
highness
the
rajah
of
seltzerpore
this
gentleman
sat
with
his
legs
stretched
beneath
the
generous
table
dinner
had
come
to
an
end
and
a
cup
of
coffee
acting
in
with
several
glasses
of
port
and
an
excellent
cigar
had
inspired
him
to
hold
forth
on
the
subject
of
poetry
prizes
he
held
forth
poetry
prize
system
said
he
it
is
astonishing
what
nonsense
a
man
ordinarily
intelligent
will
talk
after
dinner
on
exactly
the
same
principle
as
those
machines
that
you
see
at
stations
you
insert
your
penny
you
set
your
prize
subject
in
the
former
case
you
hope
for
wax
vestas
and
you
get
butterscotch
in
the
latter
you
hope
for
something
at
least
readable
and
you
get
the
most
complete
terrible
uninspired
twaddle
that
was
ever
written
on
paper
the
boy
mind
here
the
ash
of
his
cigar
fell
off
on
to
his
waistcoat
merely
boy
mind
is
incapable
of
poetry
from
which
speech
the
shrewd
reader
will
infer
that
mr
mortimer
wells
was
something
of
a
prig
and
perhaps
altogether
shrewd
reader
right
mr
lawrie
the
master
of
the
sixth
who
had
been
asked
to
dinner
to
meet
the
great
man
disagreed
as
a
matter
of
principle
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
will
take
up
a
cause
from
pure
love
of
argument
think
you
wrong
sir
i
perfectly
convinced
you
wrong
mr
wells
smiled
in
his
superior
way
as
if
to
say
that
it
was
a
pity
that
mr
lawrie
was
so
foolish
but
that
perhaps
he
could
not
help
it
he
said
you
have
not
had
to
wade
through
over
thirty
of
these
gems
in
a
single
week
i
have
i
can
assure
you
your
views
would
undergo
a
change
if
you
could
go
through
what
i
have
let
me
read
you
a
selection
if
that
does
not
convert
you
nothing
will
if
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
moment
beckett
i
will
leave
the
groaning
board
and
fetch
the
manuscripts
he
left
the
room
and
returned
with
a
pile
of
paper
which
he
deposited
in
front
of
him
on
the
table
he
said
selecting
the
topmost
manuscript
will
take
no
unfair
advantage
i
will
read
you
the
very
pick
of
the
bunch
none
of
the
other
er
poems
come
within
a
long
way
of
this
it
is
a
case
of
eclipse
first
and
the
rest
nowhere
the
author
the
gifted
author
is
a
boy
of
the
name
of
lorimer
whom
i
congratulate
on
taking
the
prize
i
drain
this
cup
of
coffee
to
him
are
you
ready
now
then
he
cleared
his
throat
a
disputed
authorship
moment
said
mr
lawrie
i
ask
what
is
the
subject
of
the
poem
of
dido
said
the
headmaster
hackneyed
evergreen
subject
mellow
with
years
go
on
wells
mr
wells
began
queen
of
tyre
ancient
tyre
whilom
mistress
of
the
wave
mr
lawrie
who
had
sunk
back
into
the
recesses
of
his
chair
in
an
attitude
of
attentive
repose
sat
up
suddenly
with
a
start
he
cried
said
mr
wells
the
beauty
of
the
work
come
home
to
you
already
notice
he
said
as
he
repeated
the
couplet
flaws
begin
to
appear
in
the
gem
right
from
the
start
it
was
rash
of
master
lorimer
to
attempt
such
a
difficult
metre
plucky
but
rash
he
should
have
stuck
to
blank
verse
tyre
you
notice
two
syllables
to
rhyme
with
deny
her
in
line
three
what
did
fortune
deny
her
were
not
all
her
warriors
brave
that
last
line
seems
to
me
distinctly
weak
i
do
know
how
it
strikes
you
hypercritical
wells
said
the
head
for
a
boy
i
consider
that
a
very
good
beginning
what
do
you
say
lawrie
er
oh
i
think
i
am
hardly
a
judge
resume
said
mr
mortimer
wells
he
resumed
and
ran
through
the
remaining
verses
of
the
poem
with
comments
when
he
had
finished
he
remarked
that
in
his
opinion
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
would
not
hurt
him
if
the
headmaster
would
excuse
him
he
would
select
another
of
those
excellent
cigars
and
smoke
it
out
of
doors
all
means
said
the
head
think
i
wo
join
you
myself
but
perhaps
lawrie
will
thank
you
i
think
i
will
remain
yes
i
think
i
will
remain
mr
wells
walked
jauntily
out
of
the
room
when
the
door
had
shut
mr
lawrie
coughed
nervously
cigar
lawrie
er
no
thank
you
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
what
is
your
candid
opinion
of
those
verses
mr
wells
was
reading
just
now
the
headmaster
laughed
do
think
wells
treated
them
quite
fairly
in
my
opinion
they
were
distinctly
promising
for
a
boy
in
the
upper
fifth
you
understand
yes
on
the
whole
they
showed
distinct
promise
were
mine
said
mr
lawrie
i
do
understand
how
were
they
yours
wrote
them
every
word
of
them
wrote
them
but
my
dear
lawrie
do
wonder
that
you
are
surprised
for
my
own
part
i
am
amazed
simply
amazed
how
the
boy
i
do
even
remember
his
name
contrived
to
get
hold
of
them
i
have
not
the
slightest
conception
but
that
he
did
so
contrive
is
certain
the
poem
is
word
for
word
literally
word
for
word
the
same
as
one
which
i
wrote
when
i
was
at
cambridge
do
say
so
it
can
hardly
be
a
coincidence
said
the
head
you
certain
of
this
certain
i
am
not
eager
to
claim
the
authorship
i
can
assure
you
especially
after
mr
wells
very
outspoken
criticisms
but
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
the
poem
appeared
more
than
a
dozen
years
ago
in
a
small
book
called
dark
something
in
the
whyte
melville
style
i
suppose
said
mr
lawrie
sharply
certainly
not
they
were
serious
poems
tragical
most
of
them
i
had
them
collected
and
published
them
at
my
own
expense
very
much
at
my
own
expense
i
used
a
pseudonym
i
am
thankful
to
say
as
far
as
i
could
ascertain
the
total
sale
amounted
to
eight
copies
i
have
never
felt
the
very
slightest
inclination
to
repeat
the
performance
but
how
this
boy
managed
to
see
the
book
is
more
than
i
can
explain
he
can
hardly
have
bought
it
the
price
was
and
there
is
certainly
no
copy
in
the
school
library
the
thing
is
a
mystery
mystery
that
must
be
solved
said
the
headmaster
fact
remains
that
he
did
see
the
book
and
it
is
very
serious
wholesale
plagiarism
of
this
description
should
be
kept
for
the
school
magazine
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
spread
to
poetry
prizes
i
must
see
lorimer
about
this
tomorrow
perhaps
he
can
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
when
in
the
course
of
morning
school
next
day
the
school
porter
entered
the
upper
fifth
and
informed
mr
sims
who
was
engaged
in
trying
to
drive
the
beauties
of
plautus
colloquial
style
into
the
upper
fifth
brain
that
the
headmaster
wished
to
see
lorimer
conscience
was
so
abnormally
good
that
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
think
why
he
had
been
sent
for
as
far
as
he
could
remember
there
was
no
possible
way
in
which
the
authorities
could
get
at
him
if
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
smoking
out
of
bounds
in
lonely
fields
and
deserted
barns
he
might
have
felt
uneasy
but
whatever
his
failings
that
was
not
one
of
them
it
could
not
be
anything
about
bounds
because
he
had
been
so
busy
with
cricket
that
he
had
had
no
time
to
break
them
this
term
he
walked
into
the
presence
glowing
with
conscious
rectitude
and
no
sooner
was
he
inside
than
the
headmaster
with
three
simple
words
took
every
particle
of
starch
out
of
his
anatomy
down
lorimer
he
said
there
are
many
ways
of
inviting
a
person
to
seat
himself
the
genial
a
pew
of
one
equal
inspires
confidence
the
raucous
down
in
front
of
the
frenzied
pit
when
you
stand
up
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
stage
is
not
so
pleasant
but
worst
of
all
is
the
icy
down
of
the
annoyed
headmaster
in
his
mouth
the
words
take
to
themselves
new
and
sinister
meanings
they
seem
to
accuse
you
of
nameless
crimes
and
to
warn
you
that
anything
you
may
say
will
be
used
against
you
as
evidence
have
i
sent
for
you
lorimer
a
nasty
question
that
and
a
very
favourite
one
of
the
rev
mr
beckett
headmaster
of
beckford
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
person
addressed
paralysed
with
nervousness
would
give
himself
away
upon
the
instant
and
confess
everything
lorimer
however
was
saved
by
the
fact
that
he
had
nothing
to
confess
he
stifled
an
inclination
to
reply
the
woodpecker
would
peck
her
or
words
to
that
effect
and
maintained
a
pallid
silence
you
ever
heard
of
a
book
called
dark
lorimer
lorimer
began
to
feel
that
the
conversation
was
too
deep
for
him
after
opening
in
the
conventional
manner
his
assailant
had
suddenly
begun
to
babble
lightly
of
sporting
literature
he
began
to
entertain
doubts
of
the
headmaster
sanity
it
would
not
have
added
greatly
to
his
mystification
if
the
head
had
gone
on
to
insist
that
he
was
the
emperor
of
peru
and
worked
solely
by
electricity
the
headmaster
for
his
part
was
also
surprised
he
had
worked
for
dismay
conscious
guilt
confessions
and
the
like
instead
of
blank
amazement
he
too
began
to
have
his
doubts
had
mr
lawrie
been
mistaken
it
was
not
likely
but
it
was
barely
possible
in
which
case
the
interview
had
better
be
brought
to
an
abrupt
stop
until
he
had
made
inquiries
the
situation
was
at
a
deadlock
fortunately
at
this
point
twelve
struck
and
the
bell
rang
for
the
end
of
morning
school
the
situation
was
saved
and
the
tension
relaxed
may
go
lorimer
said
the
head
will
send
for
you
later
he
swept
out
of
the
room
and
lorimer
raced
over
to
the
house
to
inform
pringle
that
the
headmaster
had
run
suddenly
mad
and
should
by
rights
be
equipped
with
a
never
saw
such
a
man
he
said
me
out
of
school
in
the
middle
of
a
plautus
lesson
dumps
me
down
in
a
chair
and
then
asks
me
if
i
read
some
weird
sporting
novel
or
other
novel
my
dear
man
it
sounded
like
it
from
the
title
title
oh
up
pringle
had
leaped
to
his
feet
as
if
he
had
suddenly
discovered
that
he
was
sitting
on
something
his
normal
air
of
superior
calm
had
vanished
he
was
breathless
with
excitement
a
sudden
idea
had
struck
him
with
the
force
of
a
bullet
was
the
title
he
asked
you
if
you
read
the
book
of
he
demanded
incoherently
derby
pringle
sat
down
again
relieved
are
you
certain
of
course
it
was
that
i
was
only
ragging
the
real
title
was
dark
hullo
what
up
now
have
you
got
too
up
i
tell
you
we
done
for
absolutely
pipped
what
the
matter
it
man
do
give
us
a
chance
why
ca
you
explain
instead
of
sitting
there
talking
like
that
why
are
we
done
what
have
we
done
anyway
poem
of
course
the
prize
poem
i
forgot
i
never
told
you
i
had
time
to
write
anything
of
my
own
so
i
cribbed
it
straight
out
of
a
book
called
dark
now
do
you
see
lorimer
saw
he
grasped
the
whole
unpainted
beauty
of
the
situation
in
a
flash
and
for
some
moments
it
rendered
him
totally
unfit
for
intellectual
conversation
when
he
did
speak
his
observation
was
brief
but
it
teemed
with
condensed
meaning
it
was
the
conversational
parallel
to
the
ox
in
the
aunt
he
said
be
a
row
about
this
said
pringle
am
i
to
say
when
he
has
me
in
this
afternoon
he
said
he
would
the
whole
thing
out
no
good
trying
to
hush
it
up
he
may
let
us
down
easy
if
you
honest
about
it
it
relieved
lorimer
to
hear
pringle
talk
about
it
meant
that
he
was
not
to
be
left
to
bear
the
assault
alone
which
considering
that
the
whole
trouble
was
strictly
speaking
pringle
fault
was
only
just
how
am
i
to
explain
i
ca
reel
off
a
long
yarn
all
about
how
you
did
it
all
and
so
on
it
would
be
too
low
know
said
pringle
got
it
look
here
on
your
way
to
the
old
man
room
you
pass
the
remove
door
well
when
you
pass
drop
some
money
i
be
certain
to
hear
it
as
i
sit
next
the
door
and
then
i
ask
to
leave
the
room
and
we
go
up
together
man
pringle
you
a
genius
thanks
awfully
but
as
it
happened
this
crafty
scheme
was
not
found
necessary
the
blow
did
not
fall
till
after
lorimer
being
in
the
headmaster
house
it
was
possible
to
interview
him
without
the
fuss
and
advertisement
inseparable
from
a
for
during
school
just
as
he
was
beginning
his
the
butler
came
with
a
message
that
he
was
wanted
in
the
headmaster
part
of
the
house
was
only
mr
lorimer
as
the
master
wished
to
see
said
the
butler
as
pringle
rose
to
accompany
his
companion
in
crime
all
right
said
pringle
headmaster
always
glad
to
see
me
i
got
a
standing
invitation
he
understand
at
first
when
he
saw
two
where
he
had
only
sent
for
one
the
headmaster
did
not
understand
at
all
and
said
so
he
had
prepared
to
annihilate
lorimer
hip
and
thigh
for
he
was
now
convinced
that
his
blank
astonishment
at
the
mention
of
dark
during
their
previous
interview
had
been
in
the
words
of
the
bard
a
mere
veneer
a
wile
of
guile
since
the
morning
he
had
seen
mr
lawrie
again
and
had
with
his
own
eyes
compared
the
two
poems
the
printed
and
the
written
the
author
by
special
request
having
hunted
up
a
copy
of
that
valuable
work
dark
from
the
depths
of
a
cupboard
in
his
rooms
his
astonishment
melted
before
pringle
explanation
which
was
brief
and
clear
and
gave
way
to
righteous
wrath
in
terms
he
harangued
the
two
criminals
finally
he
perorated
is
only
one
point
which
tells
in
your
favour
you
have
not
attempted
concealment
pringle
nudged
lorimer
surreptitiously
at
this
i
may
add
that
i
believe
that
as
you
say
you
did
not
desire
actually
to
win
the
prize
by
underhand
means
but
i
can
not
overlook
such
an
offence
it
is
serious
most
serious
you
will
both
of
you
go
into
extra
lesson
for
the
remaining
saturdays
of
the
term
extra
lesson
meant
that
instead
of
taking
a
on
saturday
like
an
ordinary
individual
you
treated
the
day
as
if
it
were
a
day
and
worked
from
two
till
four
under
the
eye
of
the
headmaster
taking
into
consideration
everything
the
punishment
was
not
an
extraordinarily
severe
one
for
there
were
only
two
more
saturdays
to
the
end
of
term
and
the
sentence
made
no
mention
of
the
wednesday
but
in
effect
it
was
serious
indeed
it
meant
that
neither
pringle
nor
lorimer
would
be
able
to
play
in
the
final
house
match
against
leicester
which
was
fixed
to
begin
on
the
next
saturday
at
two
among
the
rules
governing
the
house
matches
was
one
to
the
effect
that
no
house
might
start
a
match
with
less
than
eleven
men
nor
might
the
eleven
be
changed
during
the
progress
of
the
match
a
rule
framed
by
the
headmaster
not
wholly
without
an
eye
to
emergencies
like
the
present
goodness
said
pringle
there
are
any
more
first
matches
it
bad
enough
though
by
jove
as
it
is
i
suppose
occurred
to
you
that
this
cuts
us
out
of
playing
in
the
final
lorimer
said
the
point
had
not
escaped
his
notice
wish
he
observed
with
simple
pathos
i
got
the
rajah
of
seltzerpore
here
now
i
strangle
him
i
wonder
if
the
old
man
realizes
that
he
done
his
own
house
out
of
the
cup
care
if
he
did
still
it
a
sickening
nuisance
are
a
cert
now
cert
said
lorimer
ca
do
all
the
bowling
especially
on
a
hard
wicket
and
there
nobody
else
as
for
our
batting
and
fielding
gloomily
too
awful
on
the
following
saturday
leicester
ran
up
a
total
in
their
first
innings
which
put
the
issue
out
of
doubt
and
finished
off
the
game
on
the
monday
by
beating
the
school
house
by
six
wickets
the
winter
term
it
was
the
first
day
of
the
winter
term
the
bishop
as
he
came
back
by
express
could
not
help
feeling
that
after
all
life
considered
as
an
institution
had
its
points
things
had
mended
steadily
during
the
last
weeks
of
the
term
he
had
kept
up
his
end
as
head
of
the
house
perfectly
the
internal
affairs
of
were
going
as
smoothly
as
oil
and
there
was
the
cricket
cup
to
live
up
to
nothing
pulls
a
house
together
more
than
beating
all
comers
in
the
field
especially
against
odds
as
leicester
had
done
and
then
monk
and
danvers
had
left
that
had
set
the
finishing
touch
to
a
good
work
the
mob
were
no
longer
a
power
in
the
land
waterford
remained
but
a
subdued
benevolent
waterford
with
a
wonderful
respect
for
law
and
order
yes
as
far
as
the
house
was
concerned
gethryn
felt
no
apprehensions
as
regarded
the
school
at
large
things
were
bound
to
come
right
in
time
a
school
has
very
little
memory
and
in
the
present
case
the
bishop
being
second
man
in
the
fifteen
had
unusual
opportunities
of
righting
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
in
the
winter
term
cricket
is
forgotten
football
is
the
only
game
that
counts
and
to
round
off
the
whole
thing
when
he
entered
his
study
he
found
a
letter
on
the
table
it
was
from
farnie
and
revealed
two
curious
and
interesting
facts
firstly
he
had
left
and
beckford
was
to
know
him
no
more
secondly
this
was
even
more
remarkable
he
possessed
a
conscience
gethryn
ran
the
letter
am
writing
to
tell
you
my
father
is
sending
me
to
a
school
in
france
so
i
shall
not
come
back
to
beckford
i
am
sorry
about
the
match
and
i
enclose
the
four
pounds
you
lent
me
i
utterly
bar
the
idea
of
going
to
france
it
beastly
yours
truly
r
farnie
the
money
mentioned
was
in
the
shape
of
a
cheque
signed
by
farnie
senior
gethryn
was
distinctly
surprised
that
all
this
time
remorse
like
a
worm
i
the
bud
should
have
been
feeding
upon
his
uncle
damask
cheek
as
it
were
he
had
never
suspected
his
relative
demeanour
since
the
match
had
it
is
true
been
considerably
toned
down
but
this
he
had
attributed
to
natural
causes
not
unnatural
ones
like
conscience
as
for
the
four
pounds
he
had
set
it
down
as
a
bad
debt
to
get
it
back
was
like
coming
suddenly
into
an
unexpected
fortune
he
began
to
think
that
there
must
have
been
some
good
in
farnie
after
all
though
he
was
fain
to
admit
that
without
the
aid
of
a
microscope
the
human
eye
might
well
have
been
excused
for
failing
to
detect
it
his
next
thought
was
that
there
was
nothing
now
to
prevent
him
telling
the
whole
story
to
reece
and
marriott
reece
if
anybody
deserved
to
have
his
curiosity
satisfied
the
way
in
which
he
had
abstained
from
questions
at
the
time
of
the
episode
had
been
nothing
short
of
magnificent
reece
must
certainly
be
told
neither
reece
nor
marriott
had
arrived
at
the
moment
both
were
in
the
habit
of
returning
at
the
latest
possible
hour
except
at
the
beginning
of
the
summer
term
the
bishop
determined
to
reserve
his
story
until
the
following
evening
accordingly
when
the
study
kettle
was
hissing
on
the
etna
and
wilson
was
crouching
in
front
of
the
fire
making
toast
in
his
own
inimitable
style
he
embarked
upon
his
narrative
say
marriott
you
notice
a
subtle
change
in
me
this
term
does
my
expressive
purple
eye
gleam
more
brightly
than
of
yore
it
does
exactly
so
i
feel
awfully
bucked
up
you
know
that
kid
farnie
has
left
thought
i
missed
his
merry
prattle
what
happened
to
him
to
a
school
in
france
somewhere
for
france
but
the
point
is
that
now
he
gone
i
can
tell
you
about
that
match
affair
i
know
you
want
to
hear
what
really
did
happen
that
afternoon
marriott
pointed
significantly
at
wilson
whose
back
was
turned
that
all
right
said
gethryn
must
listen
try
and
think
you
a
piece
of
furniture
see
and
if
you
do
happen
to
overhear
anything
you
need
go
gassing
about
it
follow
right
said
wilson
and
gethryn
told
his
tale
he
said
as
he
finished
a
relief
it
something
to
have
got
that
off
my
chest
i
do
bar
keeping
a
secret
i
say
said
marriott
it
was
beastly
good
of
you
to
do
it
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
suppose
i
see
that
all
right
but
my
dear
man
what
a
rotten
thing
to
do
a
kid
like
that
a
little
beast
who
simply
cried
out
for
sacking
at
any
rate
it
over
now
you
need
jump
on
me
i
acted
from
the
best
motives
that
what
my
grandfather
farnie
you
know
always
used
to
say
when
he
got
at
me
for
anything
in
the
happy
days
of
my
childhood
do
sit
there
looking
like
a
beastly
churchwarden
you
ass
buck
up
and
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
things
but
really
bishop
said
marriott
must
treat
this
seriously
you
have
to
let
the
other
chaps
know
about
it
put
it
up
on
the
this
is
to
certify
that
mr
allan
gethryn
of
leicester
house
beckford
is
dismissed
without
a
stain
on
his
character
you
ass
how
can
i
let
them
know
i
seem
to
see
myself
doing
the
style
of
things
my
friends
you
wronged
me
you
wronged
me
very
grievously
but
i
forgive
you
i
put
up
with
your
cruel
scorn
i
endured
it
i
steeled
myself
against
it
and
now
i
forgive
you
profusely
every
one
of
you
let
us
embrace
it
do
you
must
see
that
much
do
be
a
goat
is
that
toast
done
yet
wilson
wilson
exhibited
several
pounds
of
the
article
in
question
said
the
bishop
a
great
man
wilson
you
can
make
a
small
selection
of
those
biscuits
and
if
you
bag
all
the
sugar
ones
i
slay
you
and
then
you
can
go
quietly
downstairs
and
rejoin
your
sorrowing
friends
and
do
you
go
telling
them
what
i
been
saying
not
said
wilson
he
made
his
small
selection
and
retired
the
bishop
turned
to
marriott
again
shall
tell
reece
because
he
deserves
it
and
i
rather
think
i
shall
tell
gosling
and
pringle
nobody
else
though
what
the
good
of
it
everybody
forget
the
whole
thing
by
next
season
about
norris
asked
marriott
there
you
have
touched
the
spot
i
ca
possibly
tell
norris
myself
my
natural
pride
is
too
enormous
descended
from
a
primordial
atomic
globule
you
know
like
pooh
bah
and
i
shook
hands
with
a
duke
once
the
man
norris
and
i
i
regret
to
say
had
something
of
a
row
on
the
subject
last
term
we
parted
with
mutual
expressions
of
hate
and
have
spoken
since
what
i
should
like
would
be
for
somebody
else
to
tell
him
all
about
it
not
you
it
would
look
too
much
like
a
job
so
do
you
go
saying
anything
swear
not
you
must
swear
let
me
hear
you
swear
by
the
bones
of
your
ancestors
right
i
call
it
awful
rot
though
be
helped
painful
but
necessary
now
i
going
to
tell
reece
though
i
do
expect
he
remember
anything
about
it
reece
never
remembers
anything
beyond
his
last
meal
said
marriott
after
him
as
the
door
closed
do
know
though
he
added
to
himself
and
pouring
himself
out
another
cup
of
tea
he
pondered
deeply
over
the
matter
reece
heard
the
news
without
emotion
a
good
sort
bishop
he
said
knew
something
of
the
kind
must
have
happened
it
reminds
me
of
a
thing
that
happened
to
it
is
rather
like
it
is
it
said
the
bishop
the
way
talking
about
stories
a
chap
i
met
in
the
holidays
told
me
a
ripper
you
see
this
chap
and
his
brother
he
discoursed
fluently
for
some
twenty
minutes
reece
sighed
softly
but
made
no
attempt
to
resume
his
broken
narrative
he
was
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
it
was
a
fortnight
later
and
marriott
and
the
bishop
were
once
more
seated
in
their
study
waiting
for
wilson
to
get
tea
ready
wilson
made
toast
in
the
foreground
marriott
was
in
football
clothes
rubbing
his
shin
gently
where
somebody
had
kicked
it
in
the
scratch
game
that
afternoon
after
rubbing
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
he
spoke
suddenly
must
tell
norris
he
said
all
rot
ca
i
shall
do
you
swore
you
would
but
look
here
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
question
what
sort
of
a
time
did
you
have
in
that
scratch
game
tonight
i
touched
the
ball
exactly
four
times
if
i
was
so
awfully
ornamental
i
do
see
what
would
be
the
use
of
my
turning
out
at
all
i
no
practical
good
to
the
team
that
just
what
i
wanted
to
get
at
i
do
mean
your
remark
about
your
being
ornamental
but
about
your
never
touching
the
ball
until
you
explain
matters
to
norris
you
never
will
get
a
decent
pass
norris
and
you
are
a
rattling
good
pair
of
centre
threes
but
if
he
never
gives
you
a
pass
i
do
see
how
we
can
expect
to
have
any
combination
in
the
first
it
no
good
my
slinging
out
the
ball
if
the
centres
stick
to
it
like
glue
directly
they
get
it
and
refuse
to
give
it
up
it
simply
sickening
marriott
played
half
for
the
first
fifteen
and
his
soul
was
in
the
business
my
dear
chap
said
gethryn
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
a
man
like
norris
would
purposely
rot
up
the
first
combination
because
he
happened
to
have
had
a
row
with
the
other
centre
he
much
too
decent
a
fellow
i
do
mean
that
exactly
what
he
does
is
this
i
watched
him
he
gets
the
ball
he
runs
with
it
till
his
man
is
on
him
and
then
he
thinks
of
passing
you
backing
him
up
he
sees
you
and
says
to
himself
i
ca
pass
to
that
cad
me
you
awfully
mention
it
i
merely
quoting
his
thoughts
as
deduced
by
me
he
says
i
ca
pass
to
that
well
individual
if
you
prefer
it
where
somebody
else
so
he
hesitates
and
gets
tackled
or
else
slings
the
ball
wildly
out
to
somebody
who
ca
possibly
get
to
it
it
simply
infernal
and
we
play
the
nomads
tomorrow
too
something
must
be
done
ought
to
tell
him
why
does
our
genial
skipper
assert
his
authority
a
forward
you
see
and
does
get
an
opportunity
of
noticing
it
i
ca
tell
him
of
course
i
not
got
my
colours
a
cert
for
them
so
anyway
i
not
got
them
yet
and
norris
has
so
i
very
well
go
slanging
him
to
hill
sort
of
thing
rude
people
would
call
side
i
look
out
tomorrow
and
if
it
as
bad
as
you
think
speak
to
hill
it
a
beastly
thing
to
have
to
do
agreed
marriott
got
to
be
done
though
we
ca
go
through
the
season
without
any
combination
in
the
line
just
to
spare
norris
feelings
a
pity
though
said
the
bishop
norris
is
a
ripping
good
sort
of
chap
really
i
wish
we
had
had
that
last
term
the
bishop
scores
at
this
point
wilson
finished
the
toast
and
went
out
as
he
went
he
thought
over
what
he
had
just
heard
marriott
and
gethryn
frequently
talked
the
most
important
school
politics
before
him
for
they
had
discovered
at
an
early
date
that
he
was
a
youth
of
discretion
who
could
be
trusted
not
to
reveal
state
secrets
but
matters
now
seemed
to
demand
such
a
revelation
it
was
a
serious
thing
to
do
but
there
was
nobody
else
to
do
it
and
it
obviously
must
be
done
so
by
a
simple
process
of
reasoning
he
ought
to
do
it
half
an
hour
had
to
elapse
before
the
bell
rang
for
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
do
the
whole
thing
and
get
back
to
the
house
before
the
door
was
closed
he
took
his
cap
and
trotted
off
to
jephson
norris
was
alone
in
his
study
when
wilson
knocked
at
the
door
he
seemed
surprised
to
see
his
visitor
he
knew
wilson
well
by
sight
he
being
captain
of
the
first
eleven
and
wilson
a
distinctly
promising
junior
bat
but
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
exchanged
a
word
of
conversation
with
him
he
said
putting
down
his
book
i
say
norris
began
wilson
nervously
i
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
right
go
ahead
after
two
false
starts
wilson
at
last
managed
to
get
the
thread
of
his
story
he
did
not
mention
marriott
remarks
on
football
subjects
but
confined
himself
to
the
story
of
farnie
and
the
bicycle
ride
as
he
had
heard
it
from
gethryn
on
the
second
evening
of
the
term
that
how
it
was
you
see
he
concluded
there
was
a
long
silence
wilson
sat
nervously
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
norris
stared
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
shall
i
tell
him
it
all
right
asked
wilson
at
last
who
what
all
right
asked
norris
politely
er
gethryn
you
know
replied
wilson
slightly
disconcerted
he
had
had
a
sort
of
idea
that
norris
would
have
rushed
out
of
the
room
sprinted
over
to
leicester
and
flung
himself
on
the
bishop
bosom
in
an
agony
of
remorse
he
appeared
to
be
taking
things
altogether
too
coolly
said
norris
tell
him
anything
i
shall
have
lots
of
chances
of
speaking
to
him
myself
if
i
want
to
it
is
as
if
we
were
never
going
to
meet
again
you
better
cut
now
there
the
bell
just
going
good
night
night
norris
and
i
say
said
norris
as
wilson
opened
the
door
meant
to
tell
you
some
time
ago
if
you
buck
up
next
cricket
season
it
quite
possible
that
you
get
colours
of
some
sort
you
might
bear
that
in
mind
will
said
wilson
fervently
night
norris
thanks
awfully
the
nomads
brought
down
a
reasonably
hot
team
against
beckford
as
a
general
rule
for
the
school
had
a
reputation
in
the
football
world
they
were
a
big
lot
this
year
their
forwards
looked
capable
and
when
after
the
school
had
returned
the
ball
into
touch
on
the
line
the
had
resulted
in
a
and
a
scrum
they
proved
that
appearances
were
not
deceptive
they
broke
through
in
a
solid
mass
the
beckford
forwards
never
somehow
seemed
to
get
together
properly
in
the
first
scrum
of
a
big
match
and
rushed
the
ball
down
the
field
norris
fell
on
it
another
scrum
and
the
nomads
front
rank
was
off
again
ten
yards
nearer
the
school
line
there
was
another
halt
grainger
the
beckford
whose
speciality
was
the
stopping
of
rushes
had
curled
himself
neatly
round
the
ball
then
the
school
forwards
awoke
to
a
sense
of
their
responsibilities
it
was
time
they
did
for
beckford
was
now
penned
up
well
within
its
own
line
and
the
nomad
halves
were
appealing
pathetically
to
their
forwards
to
let
that
ball
out
for
goodness
but
the
forwards
fancied
a
combined
rush
was
the
thing
to
play
for
a
full
minute
they
pushed
the
school
pack
towards
their
line
and
then
some
rash
enthusiast
kicked
a
shade
too
hard
the
ball
dribbled
out
of
the
scrum
on
the
school
side
and
marriott
punted
into
touch
let
it
out
you
men
said
the
aggrieved
marriott
kick
had
not
brought
much
relief
the
visitors
were
still
inside
the
beckford
line
and
now
that
their
forwards
had
realized
the
sin
and
folly
of
trying
to
rush
the
ball
through
matters
became
decidedly
warm
for
the
school
outsides
norris
and
gethryn
in
the
centre
and
grainger
at
back
performed
prodigies
of
tackling
the
wing
hovered
nervously
about
feeling
that
their
time
might
come
at
any
moment
the
nomad
attack
was
concentrated
on
the
extreme
right
philips
the
international
was
officiating
for
them
as
on
that
side
and
they
played
to
him
if
he
once
got
the
ball
he
would
take
a
considerable
amount
of
stopping
but
the
ball
never
managed
to
arrive
norris
and
gethryn
stuck
to
their
men
closer
than
brothers
a
prolonged
struggle
on
the
is
a
great
spectacle
that
is
why
purely
in
the
opinion
of
the
present
scribe
rugby
is
such
a
much
better
game
than
association
you
do
get
that
sort
of
thing
in
soccer
but
such
struggles
generally
end
in
the
same
way
the
nomads
were
now
within
a
couple
of
yards
of
the
school
line
it
was
a
question
of
time
in
three
minutes
the
whistle
would
blow
for
and
the
school
would
be
saved
but
in
those
three
minutes
the
thing
happened
for
the
first
time
in
the
match
the
nomad
forwards
heeled
absolutely
cleanly
hitherto
the
ball
had
always
remained
long
enough
in
the
scrum
to
give
marriott
and
wogan
the
school
halves
time
to
get
round
and
on
to
their
men
before
they
could
become
dangerous
but
this
time
the
ball
was
in
and
out
again
in
a
moment
the
nomad
half
who
was
taking
the
scrum
picked
it
up
and
was
over
the
line
before
marriott
realized
that
the
ball
was
out
at
all
the
school
lining
the
ropes
along
the
applauded
politely
but
feebly
as
was
their
custom
when
the
enemy
scored
the
kick
was
a
difficult
one
the
man
had
got
over
in
the
corner
and
failed
the
referee
blew
his
whistle
for
the
teams
sucked
lemons
and
the
beckford
forwards
tried
to
explain
to
hill
the
captain
why
they
never
got
that
ball
in
the
scrums
hill
having
observed
bitterly
as
he
did
in
every
match
when
the
school
did
not
get
thirty
points
in
the
first
half
that
he
chuck
the
whole
lot
of
them
out
next
saturday
the
game
recommenced
beckford
started
on
the
second
half
with
three
points
against
them
but
with
both
wind
what
there
was
of
it
and
slope
in
their
favour
three
points
especially
in
a
club
match
where
one
opponents
may
reasonably
be
expected
to
suffer
from
lack
of
training
and
combination
is
not
an
overwhelming
score
beckford
was
hopeful
and
determined
to
record
all
the
fluctuations
of
the
game
for
the
next
minutes
is
unnecessary
copies
of
containing
a
full
report
crammed
with
details
and
written
in
the
most
polished
english
may
still
be
had
from
the
editor
at
the
modest
price
of
sixpence
suffice
it
to
say
that
two
minutes
from
the
the
nomads
increased
their
score
with
a
goal
from
a
mark
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
marriott
gave
the
school
their
first
score
with
a
neat
it
was
about
five
minutes
from
the
end
of
the
game
and
the
nomads
still
led
when
the
event
of
the
afternoon
took
place
the
nomad
forwards
had
brought
the
ball
down
the
ground
with
one
of
their
combined
dribbles
and
a
scrum
had
been
formed
on
the
beckford
line
the
visitors
heeled
as
usual
the
half
who
was
taking
the
scrum
whipped
the
ball
out
in
the
direction
of
his
colleague
but
before
it
could
reach
him
wogan
had
intercepted
the
pass
and
was
off
down
the
field
through
the
enemy
line
with
only
the
back
in
front
of
him
and
with
norris
in
close
attendance
followed
by
gethryn
there
is
nothing
like
an
intercepted
pass
for
adding
a
dramatic
touch
to
a
close
game
a
second
before
it
had
seemed
as
though
the
school
must
be
beaten
for
though
they
would
probably
have
kept
the
enemy
out
for
the
few
minutes
that
remained
they
could
never
have
worked
the
ball
down
the
field
by
ordinary
play
and
now
unless
wogan
shamefully
bungled
what
he
had
begun
so
well
victory
was
certain
there
was
a
danger
though
wogan
might
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
try
to
get
past
the
back
and
score
himself
instead
of
waiting
until
the
back
was
on
him
and
then
passing
to
norris
the
school
on
the
shrieked
their
applause
but
there
was
a
note
of
anxiety
as
well
a
slight
reputation
which
wogan
had
earned
for
playing
a
selfish
game
sprang
up
before
their
eyes
would
he
pass
or
would
he
run
himself
if
the
latter
the
odds
were
anything
against
his
succeeding
but
everything
went
right
wogan
arrived
at
the
back
drew
that
gentleman
undivided
attention
to
himself
and
then
slung
the
ball
out
to
norris
the
model
of
what
a
pass
ought
to
be
norris
made
no
mistake
about
it
then
the
remarkable
thing
happened
the
bishop
having
backed
norris
up
for
fifty
yards
at
full
speed
could
not
stop
himself
at
once
his
impetus
carried
him
on
when
all
need
for
expenditure
of
energy
had
come
to
an
end
he
was
just
slowing
down
leaving
norris
to
complete
the
thing
alone
when
to
his
utter
amazement
he
found
the
ball
in
his
hands
norris
had
passed
to
him
with
a
clear
run
in
and
the
nearest
foeman
yards
to
the
rear
norris
had
passed
it
was
certainly
weird
but
his
first
duty
was
to
score
there
must
be
no
mistake
about
the
scoring
afterwards
he
could
do
any
thinking
that
might
be
required
he
shot
at
express
speed
over
the
line
and
placed
the
ball
in
the
exact
centre
of
the
white
line
which
joined
the
posts
then
he
walked
back
to
where
norris
was
waiting
for
him
man
said
norris
was
awfully
good
his
tone
was
friendly
he
spoke
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
speak
before
the
match
gethryn
took
his
cue
from
him
it
was
evident
that
for
reasons
at
present
unexplained
norris
wished
for
peace
and
such
being
the
case
the
bishop
was
only
too
glad
to
oblige
him
he
said
was
jolly
good
of
you
to
let
me
in
like
that
why
you
only
got
to
walk
over
i
do
know
i
might
have
slipped
or
something
anyhow
i
thought
i
better
pass
what
price
beckford
combination
the
article
eh
said
the
bishop
by
the
way
said
norris
was
talking
to
young
wilson
yesterday
evening
or
rather
he
was
talking
to
me
decent
kid
is
he
he
was
telling
me
about
farnie
the
match
you
know
and
so
on
said
the
bishop
he
began
to
see
how
things
had
happened
said
norris
that
gives
us
the
game
a
roar
of
applause
from
the
greeted
the
successful
attempt
of
hill
to
convert
gethryn
try
into
the
necessary
goal
the
referee
performed
a
solo
on
the
whistle
and
immediately
afterwards
another
as
if
as
an
encore
side
he
said
pensively
the
school
had
won
by
two
points
all
right
said
norris
say
can
you
come
and
have
tea
in
my
study
when
you
changed
some
of
the
fellows
are
coming
asked
reece
and
marriott
and
pringle
said
he
turn
up
too
it
be
rather
a
tight
fit
but
we
manage
somehow
said
the
bishop
very
much
norris
was
correct
it
was
a
tight
fit
but
then
a
study
brew
loses
half
its
charm
if
there
is
room
to
breathe
it
was
a
most
enjoyable
ceremony
in
every
way
after
the
serious
part
of
the
meal
was
over
and
the
time
had
arrived
when
it
was
found
pleasanter
to
eat
wafer
biscuits
than
muffins
the
bishop
obliged
once
more
with
a
recital
of
his
adventures
on
that
distant
day
in
the
summer
term
there
were
several
comments
when
he
had
finished
the
only
one
worth
recording
is
reece
reece
said
it
distinctly
reminded
him
of
a
thing
which
had
happened
to
a
friend
of
a
chap
his
brother
had
known
at
sandhurst
