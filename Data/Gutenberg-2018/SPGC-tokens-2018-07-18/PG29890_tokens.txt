the
doctor
family
chapter
i
young
dr
rider
lived
in
the
new
quarter
of
carlingford
had
he
aimed
at
a
reputation
in
society
he
could
not
possibly
have
done
a
more
foolish
thing
but
such
was
not
his
leading
motive
the
young
man
being
but
young
aimed
at
a
practice
he
was
not
particular
in
the
mean
time
as
to
the
streets
in
which
his
patients
dwelt
a
new
house
gazing
with
all
its
windows
over
a
was
as
interesting
to
the
young
surgeon
as
if
it
had
been
one
of
those
exclusive
houses
in
grange
lane
where
the
aristocracy
of
carlingford
lived
retired
within
their
garden
walls
his
own
establishment
though
sufficiently
comfortable
was
of
a
kind
utterly
to
shock
the
feelings
of
the
refined
community
a
corner
house
with
a
surgery
round
the
corner
throwing
the
gleam
of
its
red
lamp
over
all
that
chaotic
district
of
streets
and
with
its
prominent
and
young
rider
name
on
a
staring
brass
plate
with
mysterious
initials
after
it
the
unhappy
young
man
had
been
seduced
to
put
after
his
name
upon
that
brass
plate
though
he
was
really
dr
rider
a
physician
if
not
an
experienced
one
friends
had
advised
him
that
in
such
districts
people
were
afraid
of
physicians
associating
only
with
dread
adumbrations
of
a
guinea
a
visit
that
miscomprehended
name
so
with
a
pang
the
young
surgeon
had
put
his
degree
in
his
pocket
and
put
up
with
the
inferior
distinction
of
course
dr
marjoribanks
had
all
the
patronage
of
grange
lane
the
great
people
were
infatuated
about
that
snuffy
old
scotchman
a
man
behind
his
day
who
had
rusted
and
grown
old
among
the
soft
diseases
of
carlingford
where
sharp
practice
was
so
seldom
necessary
and
no
opening
appeared
for
young
rider
except
in
the
new
district
in
the
smug
corner
house
with
the
surgery
and
the
red
lamp
and
on
a
brass
plate
on
his
door
if
you
can
imagine
that
the
young
man
bowed
his
spirit
to
this
without
a
struggle
you
do
the
poor
young
fellow
injustice
he
had
been
hard
enough
put
to
it
at
divers
periods
of
his
life
ambition
had
not
been
possible
for
him
either
in
one
shape
or
another
some
people
said
he
had
a
vulgar
mind
when
he
subsided
into
that
house
other
people
declared
him
a
shabby
fellow
when
he
found
out
after
the
hardest
night
thought
he
ever
went
through
in
his
life
that
he
durst
not
ask
bessie
christian
to
marry
him
you
do
suppose
that
he
did
not
know
in
his
secret
heart
and
feel
tingling
through
every
vein
those
words
which
nobody
ever
said
to
his
face
but
he
could
not
help
it
he
could
only
make
an
indignant
gulp
of
his
resentment
and
shame
which
were
shame
and
resentment
at
himself
for
wanting
the
courage
to
dare
everything
as
well
as
at
other
people
for
finding
him
out
and
go
on
with
his
work
as
he
best
could
he
was
not
a
hero
nor
a
martyr
men
made
of
that
stuff
have
large
compensations
he
was
an
ordinary
individual
with
no
sublimity
in
him
and
no
compensation
to
speak
of
for
his
sufferings
no
consciousness
of
lofty
or
of
a
course
of
action
superior
to
the
world
perhaps
you
would
prefer
to
go
and
see
for
yourself
what
was
the
skeleton
in
edward
rider
cupboard
rather
than
have
it
described
to
you
his
drag
came
to
the
door
an
hour
ago
and
he
went
off
with
care
sitting
behind
him
and
a
certain
angry
pang
aching
in
his
heart
which
perhaps
bessie
christian
seen
far
off
in
church
yesterday
might
have
something
to
do
with
his
looks
were
rather
black
as
he
twitched
the
reins
out
of
his
little
groom
hands
and
went
off
at
a
startling
pace
which
was
almost
the
only
consolation
the
young
fellow
had
now
that
he
is
certainly
gone
and
the
coast
clear
we
may
go
it
is
true
he
all
but
kicked
the
curate
down
for
taking
a
similar
liberty
but
we
who
are
less
visible
may
venture
while
he
is
away
this
skeleton
is
not
in
a
cupboard
it
is
in
an
room
comfortable
enough
but
heated
close
unwholesome
a
place
from
which
even
when
the
window
is
open
the
fresh
air
seems
shut
out
there
is
no
fresh
air
nor
current
of
life
in
this
stifling
place
there
is
a
fire
though
it
is
not
cold
a
sofa
near
the
fire
a
sickening
heavy
smell
of
abiding
tobacco
not
light
whiffs
of
smoke
such
as
accompany
a
labours
but
a
dead
pall
of
idle
heavy
vapour
and
in
the
midst
of
all
a
man
stretched
lazily
on
the
sofa
with
his
pipe
laid
on
the
table
beside
him
and
a
book
in
his
soft
boneless
nerveless
hands
a
large
man
interpenetrated
with
smoke
and
idleness
and
a
certain
dreary
sodden
dissipation
heated
yet
unexcited
reading
a
novel
he
has
read
times
before
he
turns
his
bemused
eyes
to
the
door
when
his
invisible
visitors
enter
he
fancies
he
hears
some
one
coming
but
will
not
take
the
trouble
to
rise
and
see
who
is
there
so
instead
of
that
exertion
he
takes
up
his
pipe
knocks
the
ashes
out
of
it
upon
his
book
fills
it
with
coarse
tobacco
and
stretches
his
long
arm
over
the
shoulder
of
the
sofa
for
a
light
his
feet
are
in
slippers
his
person
clothed
in
a
greasy
old
coat
his
linen
soiled
and
untidy
that
is
the
skeleton
in
young
rider
house
the
servants
you
may
be
sure
knew
all
about
this
unwelcome
visitor
they
went
with
bottles
and
jugs
secretly
to
bring
him
what
he
wanted
they
went
to
the
circulating
library
for
him
they
let
him
in
when
he
had
been
out
in
the
twilight
all
shabby
and
slovenly
they
would
not
be
human
if
they
did
not
talk
about
him
they
say
he
is
very
poor
gentleman
always
has
a
pleasant
word
is
nobody
enemy
but
his
own
and
to
see
how
the
doctor
do
look
at
him
and
he
his
own
brother
as
was
brought
up
with
him
is
dreadful
to
be
sure
all
this
young
rider
takes
silently
never
saying
a
word
about
it
to
any
human
creature
he
seems
to
know
by
intuition
what
all
these
people
say
of
him
as
he
drives
about
furiously
in
his
drag
from
patient
to
patient
and
wherever
he
goes
as
plain
nay
far
more
distinctly
than
the
actual
prospect
before
him
he
sees
that
sofa
that
dusty
fire
that
pipe
with
the
little
heap
of
ashes
knocked
out
of
it
upon
the
table
that
wasted
ruined
life
chafing
him
to
desperation
with
its
dismal
content
it
is
very
true
that
it
would
have
been
sadly
imprudent
of
the
young
man
to
go
to
the
little
house
in
grove
street
a
year
ago
and
tell
bessie
christian
he
was
very
fond
of
her
and
that
somehow
for
her
love
he
would
manage
to
provide
for
those
old
people
whom
that
cheerful
little
woman
toiled
to
maintain
it
was
a
thing
not
to
be
done
in
any
way
you
could
contemplate
it
and
with
a
heartache
the
poor
young
doctor
had
turned
his
horse
head
away
from
grove
street
and
left
bessie
to
toil
on
in
her
poverty
bessie
had
escaped
all
that
nowadays
but
who
could
have
forewarned
the
poor
doctor
that
his
elder
brother
once
the
hope
of
the
family
that
clever
fred
whom
all
the
others
had
been
postponed
to
he
who
with
his
evil
reputation
had
driven
poor
edward
out
of
his
first
practice
and
sent
him
to
begin
life
a
second
time
at
carlingford
was
to
drop
listlessly
in
again
and
lay
a
harder
burden
than
a
harmless
old
upon
the
young
man
hands
a
burden
which
no
grateful
bessie
shared
and
sweetened
no
wonder
black
care
sat
at
the
young
doctor
back
as
he
drove
at
that
dangerous
pace
through
the
new
encumbered
streets
he
might
have
broken
his
neck
over
those
heaps
of
brick
and
mortar
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
would
have
greatly
cared
when
dr
rider
went
home
that
night
the
first
sight
he
saw
when
he
pulled
up
at
his
own
door
was
his
brother
large
indolent
shabby
figure
prowling
up
the
street
in
the
temper
he
was
then
in
this
was
not
likely
to
soothe
him
it
was
not
a
street
but
the
young
doctor
knew
instinctively
that
his
visitor
had
been
away
in
the
heart
of
the
town
at
the
booksellers
shops
buying
cheap
novels
and
ordering
them
magnificently
to
be
sent
to
dr
rider
and
could
guess
the
curious
questions
and
large
answers
which
had
followed
he
sprang
to
the
ground
with
a
painful
suppressed
indignation
intensified
by
many
mingled
feelings
and
waited
the
arrival
of
the
maudlin
wanderer
ah
me
one
might
have
had
some
consolation
in
the
burden
freely
undertaken
for
love
sake
and
by
love
self
shared
and
lightened
but
this
load
of
disgrace
and
ruin
which
nobody
could
take
part
of
which
it
was
misery
so
much
as
to
think
that
anybody
knew
of
the
doctor
fraternal
sentiments
blunted
by
absence
and
injury
were
not
strong
enough
to
bear
that
weight
so
fred
you
have
been
out
said
dr
rider
moodily
as
he
stood
aside
on
his
own
threshold
to
let
his
brother
pass
in
not
with
the
courtesy
of
a
host
but
the
precaution
of
a
jailer
to
see
him
safe
before
he
himself
entered
and
closed
the
door
yes
you
ca
expect
a
man
to
sit
in
the
house
for
ever
said
the
prodigal
stumbling
in
to
his
brother
favourite
where
everything
was
tidy
and
comfortable
for
the
brief
leisure
of
the
man
the
man
who
did
no
work
threw
himself
heavily
into
the
doctor
and
rolled
his
bemused
eyes
round
upon
his
brother
household
gods
those
with
a
bust
at
either
corner
those
red
curtains
drawn
across
the
window
those
prints
on
the
walls
all
once
so
pleasant
to
the
doctor
eyes
took
a
certain
air
of
squalor
and
wretchedness
which
sickened
him
to
look
at
the
lamp
flared
wildly
with
an
untrimmed
wick
or
at
least
dr
rider
thought
so
and
threw
a
hideous
profile
of
the
intruder
upon
the
wall
behind
him
the
hearth
was
cold
with
that
chill
of
sentiment
rather
than
reality
naturally
belonging
to
a
summer
night
instead
of
a
familiar
place
where
rest
and
tranquillity
awaited
him
that
room
the
only
vision
of
home
which
the
poor
young
fellow
possessed
hardened
into
four
walls
and
so
many
chairs
and
tables
in
the
doctor
troubled
eyes
but
it
bore
a
different
aspect
in
the
eyes
of
his
maudlin
brother
looking
round
with
those
bewildered
orbs
all
this
appeared
luxury
to
the
wanderer
mentally
he
appraised
the
prints
over
the
mantelshelf
and
reckoned
how
much
of
luxuries
might
be
purchased
out
of
them
that
was
all
so
much
money
wasted
by
the
croesus
before
him
what
a
mint
of
money
the
fellow
must
be
making
and
grudged
a
little
comfort
to
his
brother
his
elder
brother
the
cleverest
of
the
family
the
dull
exasperation
of
selfishness
woke
in
the
mind
of
the
man
you
snug
enough
here
he
exclaimed
though
you
shut
me
in
to
burrow
out
of
sight
by
jove
as
if
i
were
not
good
enough
to
face
your
carlingford
patients
i
had
a
better
practice
in
my
day
than
ever
you
see
my
fine
fellow
with
your
beggarly
and
have
me
shut
myself
up
in
my
garret
into
the
bargain
you
ashamed
of
me
forsooth
you
can
go
spending
money
on
that
rubbish
there
and
pay
a
tailor
bill
for
your
elder
brother
and
as
for
introducing
me
in
this
wretched
hole
of
a
place
and
letting
me
pick
up
a
little
money
for
myself
i
a
man
with
twice
the
experience
in
the
profession
that
you
have
fred
stop
that
cried
the
doctor
i
had
about
enough
look
here
i
ca
deny
you
shelter
and
what
you
call
necessaries
because
you
my
brother
but
i
wo
submit
to
be
ruined
a
second
time
by
any
man
if
i
am
ever
to
do
any
good
in
this
world
and
whether
i
do
any
good
or
not
he
added
fiercely
i
not
have
my
good
name
tarnished
and
my
work
interfered
with
i
do
care
two
straws
for
my
life
it
hard
enough
as
hard
as
a
treadmill
and
never
a
drop
of
consolation
in
the
cup
though
i
might
have
had
that
if
i
had
been
anything
but
a
fool
but
look
here
i
do
care
for
my
practice
i
have
you
put
your
confounded
spoke
in
my
wheel
again
keep
on
in
your
own
way
smoke
and
drink
and
dream
if
you
will
but
i
stand
no
interference
with
my
work
and
that
i
tell
you
once
for
all
this
speech
was
uttered
with
great
vehemence
the
speaker
walking
up
and
down
the
room
all
the
while
the
bitterness
of
ingratitude
and
malice
had
entered
into
the
young
man
soul
all
the
wrongs
which
the
clever
elder
brother
to
whose
claims
everybody
else
was
subordinated
had
done
to
his
family
rose
upon
the
recollection
of
the
younger
all
the
still
bitterer
sting
of
that
injury
which
had
been
personal
to
himself
all
the
burden
and
peril
of
this
present
undesired
visit
the
discontent
the
threats
the
evident
power
of
doing
evil
woke
the
temper
and
spirit
of
the
young
doctor
it
was
not
fred
fault
that
his
brother
had
made
that
mistake
in
life
which
he
repented
so
bitterly
bessie
bridal
veil
and
white
ribbons
her
joyful
face
untouched
with
any
pensive
reminiscences
and
the
dead
dulness
of
that
house
into
which
foot
of
woman
never
entered
were
not
of
fred
doing
but
passion
is
not
reasonable
the
doctor
gave
fred
credit
unconsciously
for
the
whole
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
whole
world
of
passionate
mortified
feeling
vexation
almost
despair
throbbing
within
him
he
seemed
to
have
made
a
vast
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
this
brother
who
scorned
him
to
his
face
you
hot
said
the
disreputable
figure
in
dr
rider
much
hotter
than
there
any
occasion
for
do
i
envy
you
your
beggarly
patients
do
you
suppose
but
ned
you
never
were
cut
out
for
the
profession
a
good
shopkeeping
business
would
have
been
a
deal
better
for
you
hang
it
you
have
the
notions
of
a
gentleman
you
think
bread
and
water
is
all
you
bound
to
furnish
your
brother
when
he
is
under
a
cloud
as
for
society
i
never
see
a
soul
not
even
yourself
though
you
no
great
company
look
here
i
am
not
unreasonable
order
in
some
supper
there
a
good
fellow
and
let
have
a
comfortable
evening
together
you
not
the
man
you
used
to
be
ned
you
used
to
be
a
fellow
of
spirit
somebody
jilted
you
or
something
i
do
want
to
pry
into
your
secrets
but
let
have
a
little
comfort
for
once
in
a
way
and
you
shall
have
the
whole
business
about
the
old
colony
and
how
i
came
to
leave
it
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
it
was
some
time
before
the
victim
yielded
at
last
half
to
escape
the
painful
ferment
of
his
own
thoughts
and
half
with
a
natural
yearning
for
some
sympathy
and
companionship
however
uncongenial
he
fell
out
of
his
heat
and
passion
into
a
more
complacent
mood
he
sat
down
watching
with
a
gulp
of
disgust
that
lolling
figure
in
the
chair
every
gesture
of
which
was
the
more
distasteful
for
being
so
familiar
and
recalling
a
hundred
preliminary
scenes
all
tending
towards
this
total
wreck
and
shame
then
his
mind
softened
with
fraternal
instincts
strange
interlacement
of
loathing
and
affection
he
was
tired
hungry
chilled
to
his
heart
the
spell
of
material
comfort
even
in
such
company
came
upon
the
young
man
they
supped
together
not
much
to
the
advantage
of
dr
rider
head
stomach
or
temper
on
the
following
morning
the
elder
told
his
story
of
inevitable
failure
and
strange
unexplainable
fatality
the
younger
dropped
forth
expressions
of
disappointment
and
trouble
which
partly
eased
his
own
mind
thus
they
spent
together
the
unlovely
evening
and
perhaps
a
few
such
nights
would
have
done
as
much
harm
to
the
young
doctor
practice
as
had
he
introduced
his
disreputable
brother
without
more
ado
into
the
particular
little
world
of
carlingford
chapter
ii
next
morning
dr
rider
rose
mightily
vexed
with
himself
as
was
to
be
supposed
he
was
half
an
hour
late
for
breakfast
he
had
a
headache
his
hand
shook
and
his
temper
was
awful
before
he
was
dressed
ominous
knocks
came
to
the
door
and
all
feverish
and
troubled
as
he
was
you
may
imagine
that
the
prospect
of
the
day
work
before
him
did
not
improve
his
feelings
and
that
direst
of
tormentors
did
not
mend
the
matter
two
ladies
were
waiting
for
him
he
was
told
when
he
went
not
to
say
sundry
notes
and
messages
in
the
ordinary
way
of
business
two
ladies
who
had
brought
two
boxes
with
them
and
asked
leave
to
put
them
in
the
hall
till
they
could
see
dr
rider
the
sight
of
this
luggage
in
his
little
hall
startled
the
doctor
patients
do
not
generally
carry
such
things
about
with
them
what
did
it
mean
what
could
two
ladies
want
with
him
the
young
man
felt
his
face
burn
with
painful
anticipations
a
little
shame
and
much
impatience
probably
the
sister
who
adored
fred
and
never
could
learn
to
believe
that
he
was
not
unfortunate
and
a
victim
this
would
be
a
climax
to
the
occupation
of
his
house
as
the
poor
doctor
gloomily
approached
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
he
had
spent
last
evening
he
heard
a
little
rustle
and
commotion
not
quite
consistent
with
his
expectations
a
hum
of
voices
and
soft
stir
such
as
youthful
womankind
only
makes
then
a
voice
entirely
strange
to
him
uttered
an
exclamation
involuntarily
he
started
and
changed
his
aspect
he
did
not
know
the
voice
but
it
was
young
sweet
peculiar
the
cloud
lightened
a
little
upon
the
doctor
face
notwithstanding
bessie
christian
he
was
still
young
enough
to
feel
a
little
flutter
of
curiosity
when
he
heard
such
a
voice
sounding
out
of
his
room
hark
what
did
she
say
it
was
a
profoundly
prosaic
speech
what
an
intolerable
smell
of
smoke
i
should
wonder
a
bit
indeed
i
rather
think
he
must
be
or
he
would
live
in
a
place
like
this
if
he
were
exactly
such
another
as
fred
poor
fred
said
a
plaintive
voice
if
we
only
can
learn
where
he
is
hush
there
is
a
footstep
ah
it
is
not
my
poor
fellow
footstep
nettie
hark
no
indeed
twenty
thousand
times
sharper
and
more
like
a
man
said
the
other
in
hurried
breathless
accents
hark
here
he
is
the
entire
bewilderment
the
amaze
apprehension
confusion
with
which
dr
rider
entered
the
room
from
which
this
scrap
of
conversation
reached
him
is
indescribable
a
dreadful
sense
that
something
was
about
to
happen
seized
the
young
man
mind
with
an
indescribable
curiosity
he
paused
an
instant
to
recover
himself
and
then
went
boldly
and
silently
into
the
room
which
had
become
mysterious
through
its
new
inmates
they
both
turned
round
upon
him
as
he
entered
two
young
women
one
who
had
been
sitting
at
the
table
looking
faded
plaintive
and
anxious
rose
up
suddenly
and
clasping
her
hands
as
if
in
entreaty
fixed
two
bright
but
sunken
eyes
upon
his
face
the
other
a
younger
lighter
figure
all
action
and
haste
interposed
between
him
and
her
companion
she
put
up
one
hand
in
warning
to
the
petitioner
behind
her
and
one
to
call
the
attention
of
the
bewildered
stranger
before
evidently
the
one
thing
which
alarmed
this
young
lady
was
that
somebody
would
speak
before
her
and
the
conduct
of
the
be
taken
out
of
her
hands
she
was
little
very
slight
very
pretty
but
her
prettiness
was
peculiar
the
young
doctor
accustomed
to
the
fair
saxon
version
of
beauty
given
by
bessie
christian
did
not
at
the
first
glance
believe
that
the
wonderful
little
person
before
him
possessed
any
for
she
was
not
only
slender
but
dark
eager
impetuous
with
blazing
black
eyes
and
red
lips
and
nothing
else
notable
about
her
so
he
thought
gazing
fascinated
yet
not
altogether
attracted
scarcely
sure
that
he
was
not
repelled
unable
however
to
withdraw
his
eyes
from
that
hurried
eager
little
figure
nothing
in
the
least
like
her
had
ever
yet
appeared
before
dr
rider
eyes
we
want
to
inquire
about
your
brother
said
the
little
stranger
we
know
this
was
to
be
his
address
and
we
want
to
know
whether
he
is
living
here
his
letters
were
to
be
sent
to
your
care
but
my
sister
has
not
heard
from
him
now
for
a
year
never
mind
that
never
mind
telling
that
nettie
cried
the
other
behind
her
oh
sir
only
tell
me
where
my
poor
fred
is
so
she
began
to
fear
he
was
ill
resumed
the
younger
of
the
two
undauntedly
though
susan
will
do
nothing
but
praise
him
he
has
behaved
to
her
very
shamefully
do
you
happen
to
know
sir
where
he
is
did
you
say
fred
my
brother
fred
cried
the
poor
young
doctor
in
utter
dismay
and
may
i
ask
who
it
is
that
expresses
so
much
interest
in
him
there
was
a
momentary
pause
the
two
women
exchanged
looks
i
told
you
so
cried
the
eager
little
spokeswoman
he
never
has
let
his
friends
know
he
was
afraid
of
that
i
told
you
how
it
was
this
she
continued
with
a
little
tragic
air
stretching
out
her
arm
to
her
sister
and
facing
the
doctor
this
is
mrs
frederick
rider
or
rather
mrs
rider
i
should
say
as
he
is
the
eldest
of
the
family
now
will
you
please
to
tell
us
where
he
is
the
doctor
made
no
immediate
answer
he
gazed
past
the
speaker
to
the
faded
woman
behind
and
exclaimed
with
a
kind
of
groan
fred
wife
yes
fred
wife
cried
the
poor
creature
rushing
forward
to
him
and
oh
where
is
he
i
come
thousands
of
miles
to
hear
is
he
ill
has
anything
happened
to
him
where
is
fred
susan
you
are
not
able
to
manage
this
leave
it
to
me
said
her
sister
drawing
her
back
peremptorily
dr
rider
please
to
answer
us
we
know
you
well
enough
though
you
do
seem
ever
to
have
heard
of
us
it
was
you
that
my
gave
up
his
business
to
before
he
came
out
to
the
colony
oh
we
know
all
about
it
to
keep
him
separate
from
his
wife
can
not
do
you
any
benefit
dr
edward
yes
i
know
your
name
and
all
about
it
and
i
do
mean
indeed
to
suffer
my
sister
to
be
injured
and
kept
from
her
husband
i
have
come
all
this
way
with
her
to
take
care
of
her
i
mean
to
stay
with
her
to
take
care
of
her
i
have
not
parted
with
my
money
though
she
gave
all
hers
away
and
i
mean
to
see
her
have
her
rights
oh
nettie
nettie
how
you
talk
cried
the
unfortunate
wife
you
keep
him
from
answering
me
all
this
time
i
can
not
hear
where
is
fred
be
seated
please
said
the
doctor
with
dreadful
civility
and
compose
yourselves
fred
is
well
enough
as
well
as
he
ever
is
i
know
added
poor
rider
with
irrestrainable
bitterness
whether
he
is
quite
presentable
to
ladies
but
i
presume
madam
if
you
his
wife
you
acquainted
with
his
habits
excuse
me
for
being
quite
unprepared
for
such
a
visit
i
have
not
much
leisure
for
anything
out
of
my
profession
i
can
scarcely
spare
these
minutes
that
is
the
truth
but
if
you
will
favour
me
with
a
few
particulars
i
will
have
the
news
conveyed
to
my
brother
i
i
beg
your
pardon
when
a
man
finds
he
has
new
relations
he
never
dreamed
of
it
naturally
embarrasses
him
at
the
moment
may
i
ask
if
you
ladies
have
come
from
australia
alone
oh
not
alone
the
children
are
at
the
hotel
nettie
said
it
was
no
use
coming
unless
we
all
came
said
his
new
with
a
the
children
dr
rider
gasp
of
dismay
was
silent
and
made
no
sound
he
stood
staring
blankly
at
those
wonderful
invaders
of
his
bachelor
house
marvelling
what
was
to
be
done
with
them
in
the
first
place
was
he
to
bring
fred
down
all
slovenly
and
was
he
to
leave
them
in
possession
of
his
private
sanctuary
the
precious
morning
moments
were
passing
while
he
pondered
and
his
little
groom
fidgeted
outside
with
a
message
for
the
doctor
while
he
stood
irresolute
the
indefatigable
nettie
once
more
darted
forward
give
me
fred
address
please
said
this
managing
woman
i
see
him
and
prepare
him
for
meeting
susan
he
can
say
what
he
pleases
to
me
do
mind
it
in
the
very
least
but
susan
of
course
must
be
taken
care
of
now
look
here
dr
edward
susan
is
your
and
i
am
her
sister
we
do
want
to
occupy
your
time
i
can
manage
everything
but
it
is
quite
necessary
in
the
first
place
that
you
should
confide
in
me
confide
cried
the
bewildered
man
fred
is
not
under
my
authority
he
is
here
in
my
house
much
against
my
will
he
is
in
bed
and
not
fit
to
be
awakened
and
i
am
obliged
to
tell
you
simply
ladies
said
the
unfortunate
doctor
that
my
house
has
no
accommodation
for
a
family
if
you
will
go
back
to
the
hotel
where
you
left
the
children
and
here
the
speaker
gave
another
gasp
of
horror
i
have
him
roused
and
sent
to
you
it
is
the
only
thing
i
can
do
susan
can
go
said
the
prompt
nettie
i
stay
here
until
fred
is
ready
and
take
him
to
see
them
it
is
necessary
he
should
be
prepared
you
know
do
talk
nonsense
susan
i
shall
stay
here
and
dr
rider
of
course
will
call
a
cab
for
you
but
nettie
nettie
dear
it
is
proper
i
ca
leave
you
all
by
yourself
in
a
strange
house
remonstrated
her
sister
do
talk
such
stuff
i
am
perfectly
well
able
to
take
care
of
myself
i
am
not
a
london
young
lady
said
the
courageous
nettie
it
is
perfectly
unnecessary
to
say
another
word
to
me
i
know
my
duty
i
shall
stay
here
with
which
speech
she
seated
herself
resolutely
in
that
same
which
fred
had
lolled
in
last
night
took
off
her
bonnet
for
hats
were
not
in
these
days
and
shed
off
from
her
face
with
two
tiny
hands
exquisite
in
shape
if
a
little
brown
in
colour
the
great
braids
of
silky
hair
which
encumbered
her
little
head
the
gesture
mollified
dr
rider
in
the
most
unaccountable
way
in
spite
of
himself
the
intolerable
idea
of
leaving
these
two
in
his
house
became
less
intolerable
he
could
not
tell
how
and
the
little
groom
outside
fairly
knocked
at
the
door
in
that
softening
moment
with
a
message
which
could
be
delayed
no
longer
the
doctor
put
his
head
out
to
receive
the
call
and
looked
in
again
perplexed
and
uncertain
nettie
had
quite
established
herself
in
the
she
sat
there
looking
with
her
bright
eyes
into
the
vacant
air
before
her
in
a
pretty
attitude
of
determination
and
readiness
beating
her
little
foot
on
the
carpet
something
whimsical
odd
and
embarrassing
about
her
position
made
it
all
the
more
piquant
to
the
troubled
eyes
which
in
spite
of
all
their
worldly
wisdom
were
still
the
eyes
of
a
young
man
he
could
not
tell
in
the
world
what
to
say
to
her
to
order
that
creature
out
of
his
house
was
simply
impossible
to
remain
there
was
equally
so
to
leave
them
in
possession
of
the
field
what
could
the
unfortunate
young
doctor
do
one
thing
was
certain
the
impatient
patient
could
no
longer
be
neglected
and
after
a
few
minutes
longer
of
bewildered
uncertainty
dr
rider
went
off
in
the
wildest
confusion
of
mind
leaving
his
brother
unknown
family
triumphant
in
his
invaded
house
to
describe
the
feelings
with
which
the
unfortunate
doctor
went
fasting
about
his
day
work
the
manner
in
which
that
scene
returned
to
him
after
every
visit
he
made
the
continual
succession
in
which
wrath
dismay
alarm
bitter
disgust
with
the
falsehood
of
the
brother
who
no
further
gone
than
last
night
had
pretended
to
confide
in
him
but
never
breathed
a
syllable
of
this
biggest
unconcealable
secret
swept
through
the
mind
of
the
victim
all
culminating
however
in
the
softening
of
that
moment
in
the
tiny
figure
indomitable
elf
or
fairy
shedding
back
with
dainty
fingers
those
soft
abundant
locks
would
be
impossible
the
young
man
got
through
his
work
somehow
in
a
maze
of
confusion
and
excitement
angry
excitement
indignant
confusion
determination
to
yield
nothing
further
but
to
defend
himself
and
his
house
once
for
all
from
the
inroads
of
what
he
angrily
pronounced
in
his
own
mind
another
man
family
yet
withal
of
curiosity
and
interest
which
gave
zest
greater
than
usual
to
the
idea
of
going
home
when
he
was
able
at
last
to
turn
his
horse
head
towards
his
own
dwelling
it
was
with
feelings
very
different
from
the
usual
unexpecting
blank
of
sullen
displeasure
what
he
should
find
there
was
a
curious
exciting
alarming
question
perhaps
an
entire
nursery
with
nettie
in
charge
perhaps
a
recusant
husband
with
nettie
mounting
guard
over
him
perhaps
a
thrilling
scene
of
family
explanation
and
reconciliation
the
day
had
been
a
specially
long
and
hard
one
he
had
been
obliged
to
snatch
a
hurried
lunch
at
one
of
his
patients
houses
and
to
postpone
his
dinner
to
the
most
fashionable
of
hours
it
was
indeed
quite
evening
almost
twilight
when
he
made
his
way
home
at
last
as
he
neared
the
scene
of
action
the
tired
man
condoled
with
himself
over
the
untimely
excitement
that
awaited
him
he
said
to
himself
with
pathetic
that
it
was
hard
indeed
for
a
man
who
had
earned
a
little
repose
to
go
in
upon
all
the
troubles
of
another
man
family
he
had
denied
himself
he
had
not
undertaken
upon
his
own
shoulders
that
pleasing
burden
and
now
what
was
he
to
be
saddled
with
the
burden
without
the
consolation
the
responsibility
without
the
companionship
all
this
dr
rider
represented
to
himself
very
pathetically
as
he
wended
his
homeward
way
yet
it
is
astonishing
notwithstanding
with
what
alacrity
he
hastened
upon
that
path
and
how
much
the
curiosity
the
excitement
the
dramatic
stir
and
commotion
made
in
his
monotonous
life
by
this
entirely
new
unexpected
incident
occupied
his
mind
with
expectations
highly
roused
he
drew
up
once
more
before
his
own
house
it
was
surprising
to
him
to
see
how
exactly
it
looked
like
itself
the
blinds
down
in
the
genteelest
calm
as
they
always
were
no
faces
peeping
at
the
windows
no
marks
of
an
arrival
on
the
pavement
or
in
the
composed
countenance
of
mary
who
stood
holding
the
door
open
for
him
he
went
in
with
a
little
thrill
of
curiosity
the
house
was
very
quiet
in
comparison
with
the
commotion
of
his
thoughts
so
was
the
where
he
had
left
nettie
resolutely
planted
in
the
there
was
nobody
there
now
the
boxes
were
out
of
the
hall
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
in
the
house
he
turned
rather
blankly
upon
mary
who
was
going
away
quite
composedly
as
if
there
was
nothing
which
she
wanted
to
tell
or
he
to
hear
where
is
my
brother
and
the
ladies
said
the
amazed
doctor
they
all
went
off
to
the
sir
as
soon
as
mr
rider
came
said
mary
complacently
i
assured
miss
as
it
was
the
best
thing
she
could
do
sir
for
that
i
was
sure
you
never
have
the
children
here
as
to
be
sure
there
was
no
room
neither
said
the
doctor
factotum
as
soon
as
mr
frederick
came
down
she
called
a
cab
did
miss
and
took
both
away
oh
so
they
gone
are
they
said
the
doctor
hours
and
hours
ago
answered
mary
dinner
be
up
in
two
minutes
but
i
would
say
much
for
the
potatoes
sir
when
a
it
hard
laws
on
the
poor
servants
nothink
will
keep
going
on
for
two
hours
and
not
take
no
harm
but
all
quiet
and
comfortable
in
your
room
and
with
this
assurance
which
she
evidently
thought
a
very
grateful
one
mary
went
off
to
get
the
doctor
dinner
he
walked
to
the
end
of
the
room
and
then
back
again
with
solemnity
then
threw
himself
into
that
blessed
riddance
said
the
doctor
but
somehow
he
looked
glum
wonderfully
glum
there
was
no
accounting
for
those
blank
looks
of
his
he
who
had
been
condoling
with
himself
over
the
exciting
scene
he
expected
so
uncomfortable
a
conclusion
to
a
long
day
labour
how
was
it
he
did
not
look
relieved
when
that
scene
was
spared
him
to
tell
the
truth
when
one
has
been
expecting
something
to
happen
of
whatever
description
and
has
been
preparing
one
courage
temper
one
fortitude
in
anticipatory
rehearsals
when
one
has
placed
one
self
in
the
attitude
of
a
martyr
and
prepared
to
meet
with
fiery
trials
it
is
mortifying
to
say
the
least
when
one
finds
all
the
necessities
of
the
case
disappear
and
the
mildest
calm
replace
that
tragical
anticipation
the
quiet
falls
blank
upon
the
excited
fancy
of
course
dr
rider
was
relieved
but
it
was
with
something
mightily
like
disappointment
that
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
knitted
his
brows
at
the
opposite
wall
not
for
the
world
would
he
have
acknowledged
himself
to
be
disappointed
but
the
calm
was
wonderfully
monotonous
after
all
those
expectations
he
was
never
so
bored
and
sick
of
a
night
by
himself
he
tried
to
read
but
reading
did
not
occupy
his
mind
he
grew
furious
over
his
charred
chops
and
sodden
potatoes
as
for
the
tea
mary
brought
he
would
have
gladly
pitched
it
at
her
by
way
of
diversifying
that
blank
evening
with
an
incident
the
contrast
between
what
he
had
looked
for
and
what
he
had
was
wonderful
how
delicious
this
stillness
should
have
been
this
consciousness
of
having
his
house
to
himself
and
nobody
to
interrupt
his
brief
repose
but
somehow
it
appears
that
human
nature
takes
best
with
not
having
its
wishes
granted
it
is
indescribable
how
dr
rider
yawned
how
dull
he
found
his
newspaper
how
few
books
worth
reading
there
were
in
the
house
how
slow
the
minutes
ran
on
if
somebody
had
chosen
to
be
ill
that
night
of
all
nights
the
best
for
such
a
purpose
the
doctor
would
not
have
objected
to
such
an
interruption
failing
that
he
went
to
bed
early
dreadfully
tired
of
his
own
society
such
were
the
wonderful
results
of
that
invasion
so
much
dreaded
and
that
retreat
so
much
hoped
for
perhaps
his
own
society
had
never
in
his
life
been
so
distasteful
to
him
before
chapter
iii
next
day
dr
rider
audibly
congratulated
himself
at
breakfast
upon
having
once
more
his
house
to
himself
audibly
as
if
it
were
really
necessary
to
give
utterance
to
the
thought
before
he
could
quite
feel
its
force
a
week
before
if
fred
had
departed
however
summarily
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
brother
feelings
of
relief
and
comfort
would
have
been
unfeigned
now
however
he
began
to
think
the
matter
over
and
to
justify
to
himself
his
extraordinary
sense
of
disappointment
as
he
poured
out
his
own
coffee
with
a
sober
face
his
eye
rested
upon
that
which
had
been
brought
into
such
prominence
in
the
history
of
the
last
two
days
he
kept
looking
at
it
as
he
sipped
that
gloomy
coffee
fred
had
faded
from
the
great
chair
his
big
image
threw
no
shadow
upon
it
there
sat
a
little
fairy
queen
tiny
as
titania
but
dark
as
an
elf
of
the
east
putting
up
those
two
shapely
tiny
hands
brown
and
beautiful
to
push
aside
the
flood
of
hair
which
certainly
would
have
veiled
her
little
figure
all
over
the
doctor
thought
had
it
been
let
down
wonderful
little
sprite
she
no
doubt
had
dragged
her
plaintive
sister
over
the
seas
she
it
was
that
had
forced
her
way
into
edward
rider
house
taken
her
position
in
it
ousted
the
doctor
and
she
doubtless
it
was
who
swept
the
husband
and
wife
out
of
it
again
leaving
no
trace
behind
waking
up
from
a
little
trance
of
musing
upon
this
too
interesting
subject
dr
rider
suddenly
raised
himself
into
an
erect
position
body
and
mind
with
an
involuntary
movement
as
if
to
shake
off
the
yoke
of
the
enchantress
he
reminded
himself
instinctively
of
his
brother
falsehood
and
ingratitude
after
throwing
himself
a
most
distasteful
burden
on
edward
charity
for
five
long
dreary
months
the
bugbear
of
the
doctor
dreams
and
heavy
climax
of
his
uncomfortable
thoughts
here
had
fred
departed
without
a
word
of
explanation
or
thanks
or
even
without
saying
the
doctor
thought
himself
quite
justified
in
being
angry
he
began
to
feel
that
the
suspicious
uneasiness
which
possessed
him
was
equally
natural
and
inevitable
such
a
thankless
heartless
departure
was
enough
to
put
any
man
out
to
imagine
that
fred
could
be
capable
of
it
naturally
went
to
his
brother
heart
that
day
there
was
still
no
word
of
the
party
who
had
disappeared
so
mysteriously
out
of
the
doctor
house
dr
rider
went
to
his
hard
work
vaguely
expectant
feeling
sure
he
must
hear
of
them
somehow
and
more
interested
in
hearing
of
them
than
was
to
be
expected
from
his
former
low
ebb
of
fraternal
affection
when
he
returned
and
found
still
no
letter
no
message
the
blank
disappointment
of
the
former
night
closed
still
more
blankly
upon
him
when
one
is
all
by
one
self
and
has
nothing
at
best
but
an
to
go
home
to
and
goes
home
expecting
a
letter
or
a
message
or
a
visitor
who
has
not
arrived
and
has
no
chance
of
arriving
the
revulsion
of
feeling
is
not
agreeable
it
did
not
improve
the
doctor
temper
in
the
first
place
the
chill
loneliness
of
that
trim
room
with
its
drawn
curtains
and
tidy
pretence
of
being
comfortable
exasperated
him
beyond
bearing
he
felt
shut
up
in
it
and
yet
would
not
leave
it
somebody
certainly
might
come
even
fred
himself
perhaps
if
he
could
escape
from
the
rigid
guardianship
he
was
under
or
was
that
miraculous
australian
nettie
a
little
witch
who
had
spirited
the
whole
party
in
a
nutshell
over
the
seas
never
was
man
delivered
from
a
burden
with
a
worse
grace
than
was
dr
rider
and
the
matter
had
not
mended
in
these
hours
next
morning
however
this
fever
of
fraternal
suspense
was
assuaged
a
note
addressed
in
an
odd
feminine
hand
very
thin
small
and
rapid
came
among
dr
rider
letters
he
signalled
it
out
by
instinct
and
opened
it
with
an
impatience
wonderful
to
behold
sir
we
are
all
at
the
blue
boar
until
we
can
get
lodgings
which
i
hope
to
be
i
am
utterly
ashamed
of
fred
for
not
having
let
you
know
and
indeed
of
myself
for
trusting
to
him
i
should
not
wonder
but
we
may
have
been
under
a
mistake
about
him
and
you
if
you
could
call
about
one
i
should
most
likely
be
in
to
see
you
and
perhaps
you
could
give
me
your
advice
about
the
lodgings
neither
of
have
the
least
judgment
in
such
matters
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
but
being
a
stranger
perhaps
you
will
excuse
me
i
understand
you
are
only
at
home
in
the
evening
and
that
is
just
the
time
i
ca
come
out
as
i
have
the
whole
of
them
to
look
to
which
is
the
reason
i
ask
you
to
call
on
me
begging
you
will
pardon
me
i
remain
nettie
underwood
she
remains
nettie
underwood
said
the
doctor
unawares
he
laughed
to
himself
at
that
conclusion
then
an
odd
gleam
came
across
his
face
it
was
probably
the
first
time
he
had
laughed
in
a
natural
fashion
for
some
months
back
and
the
unusual
exertion
made
his
cheeks
tingle
his
temper
was
improved
that
morning
he
went
off
to
his
patients
almost
in
a
good
humour
when
he
passed
the
great
house
where
bessie
christian
now
reigned
he
recalled
her
image
with
a
positive
effort
astonishing
what
an
effect
of
distance
had
floated
over
the
apparition
of
that
bride
was
it
a
year
since
he
saw
her
and
gnashed
his
teeth
at
the
thought
of
his
own
folly
or
was
it
only
last
sunday
the
doctor
could
not
tell
he
put
note
in
his
and
was
at
the
hotel
door
punctually
at
one
it
was
in
the
principal
street
of
carlingford
george
street
where
all
the
best
shops
and
indeed
some
of
the
best
houses
were
from
the
corner
window
of
the
hotel
you
could
see
down
into
the
bowery
seclusion
of
grange
lane
and
mr
wodehouse
famous
holding
tempting
clusters
over
the
high
wall
the
prospect
was
very
different
from
that
which
extended
before
dr
rider
window
instinctively
he
marvelled
within
himself
whether
if
dr
marjoribanks
were
to
die
people
can
not
live
for
ever
even
in
carlingford
whether
it
might
not
be
a
disadvantage
to
a
man
to
live
so
far
out
of
the
world
no
doubt
it
was
a
temptation
of
the
evil
one
happily
the
young
man
did
not
take
sufficient
time
to
answer
himself
but
walked
forward
briskly
through
the
mazy
old
passages
of
the
old
inn
to
a
room
from
which
sundry
noises
issued
dr
rider
walked
in
with
the
natural
confidence
of
a
man
who
has
an
appointment
the
room
was
in
undisturbed
possession
of
three
children
three
children
making
noise
enough
for
six
all
very
small
very
precocious
with
staring
round
eyes
and
the
most
complete
independence
of
speech
and
manners
the
doctor
confronted
the
little
rabble
thunderstruck
they
were
his
brother
children
unrecognisable
little
savages
as
they
were
one
little
fellow
in
a
linen
pinafore
was
mounted
on
the
arm
of
a
sofa
spurring
vigorously
another
was
pursuing
his
sister
about
the
room
trying
to
catch
her
feet
with
the
tongs
and
filling
the
air
with
repeated
loud
snaps
of
disappointment
they
intermitted
their
occupations
to
stare
at
him
look
here
here
a
man
said
the
youngest
meditatively
beholding
his
dismayed
uncle
with
a
philosophic
eye
ca
some
one
go
and
tell
nettie
said
the
little
girl
gazing
also
with
calm
equanimity
if
he
wants
nettie
he
have
to
wait
said
the
elder
boy
a
pause
followed
the
unhappy
doctor
stood
transfixed
by
the
steady
stare
of
their
three
pair
of
eyes
suddenly
the
little
girl
burst
out
of
the
room
and
ran
screaming
along
the
passage
mamma
mamma
here
a
man
come
cried
the
wonderful
colonial
child
a
few
minutes
afterwards
their
mother
appeared
languid
and
faded
as
before
perhaps
she
had
been
even
prettier
than
nettie
in
her
bright
days
if
any
days
had
ever
been
bright
for
fred
rider
wife
she
was
fairer
larger
smoother
than
her
sister
but
these
advantages
had
lapsed
in
a
general
fade
which
transformed
her
colour
into
washy
pinkness
made
her
figure
stoop
and
her
footsteps
drag
she
came
remonstrating
all
the
way
in
feeble
accents
it
was
not
for
her
certainly
that
the
doctor
had
taken
the
trouble
to
come
to
the
blue
boar
please
to
sit
down
said
mrs
fred
and
stood
leaning
on
the
table
looking
at
her
with
a
calm
curiosity
not
unlike
that
of
her
children
nettie
and
my
husband
have
gone
out
together
but
now
that
we
are
all
so
happy
and
united
she
continued
with
a
sort
of
feeble
spitefulness
i
am
sure
it
is
quite
a
pity
to
trouble
you
you
could
not
take
us
in
you
know
you
said
that
very
plain
mr
edward
it
was
perfectly
true
madam
said
the
doctor
i
have
not
ventured
on
the
step
my
brother
has
taken
and
have
naturally
no
accommodation
for
a
family
but
i
am
not
here
for
my
own
pleasure
your
sister
i
presume
it
is
wrote
to
me
i
was
requested
to
call
here
oh
yes
nettie
is
very
very
though
of
course
we
could
not
get
on
without
her
she
attacked
fred
like
a
for
not
writing
you
but
i
daresay
if
the
truth
were
known
you
did
not
expect
to
hear
from
my
husband
said
the
wife
recovering
her
voice
and
fixing
a
vindictive
gaze
upon
her
visitor
who
felt
himself
betrayed
i
came
by
miss
underwood
instructions
and
at
her
request
said
the
unfortunate
man
we
need
not
enter
into
any
question
between
fred
and
myself
ah
yes
that
is
very
safe
and
wise
for
you
laughed
fred
wife
the
doctor
was
deeply
exasperated
as
was
only
natural
he
eyed
the
feeble
helpless
creature
for
a
moment
angrily
provoked
to
answer
her
but
his
gaze
became
one
of
wonder
and
dismay
ere
he
withdrew
it
surely
of
all
incomprehensible
entities
the
most
amazing
is
a
fool
a
creature
insensate
unreasoning
whom
neither
argument
nor
fact
can
make
any
impression
upon
appalled
and
impressed
the
doctor
gaze
left
that
pretty
faded
face
to
turn
upon
the
children
dreadful
imps
if
fred
had
only
taken
to
evil
ways
after
he
became
possessed
of
such
a
family
his
brother
could
have
forgiven
him
while
these
thoughts
passed
through
dr
rider
mind
however
deliverance
approached
he
heard
nettie
voice
in
the
passage
long
before
she
reached
the
door
not
that
it
was
loud
like
the
voices
of
this
dreadful
household
but
the
tone
was
sufficiently
peculiar
to
be
recognised
anywhere
with
a
most
penetrating
clearness
it
came
through
the
long
passages
words
inaudible
only
the
sound
of
a
voice
rapid
breathless
decided
with
the
distant
sound
of
fred
long
shambling
uncertain
footsteps
coming
in
as
the
strange
accompaniment
then
they
entered
the
room
the
one
tiny
bright
dauntless
an
intrepid
undiscourageable
little
soul
the
other
with
his
heavy
large
limbs
his
bemused
face
his
air
of
hopeless
failure
idleness
content
edward
rider
gazed
involuntarily
from
one
to
another
of
this
two
he
saw
the
sprite
place
herself
between
the
husband
and
wife
a
vain
little
quixote
balancing
these
extremes
of
helplessness
and
ruin
he
could
not
help
looking
at
her
with
a
certain
unconscious
admiration
and
amazement
as
he
might
have
looked
at
a
forlorn
hope
thousands
of
miles
away
from
her
friends
wherever
and
whatever
they
might
be
with
fred
and
his
wife
and
children
on
her
hands
a
household
of
incapables
what
was
that
little
creature
to
do
good
morning
dr
edward
said
nettie
i
thought
i
should
have
been
back
sooner
but
fred
is
so
slow
i
can
not
manage
to
get
him
along
at
all
we
have
found
some
lodgings
a
little
way
out
of
carlingford
near
that
chapel
you
know
or
church
or
something
that
stands
a
little
off
the
road
where
it
open
and
there
morning
service
and
such
a
handsome
young
clergyman
who
is
he
we
went
into
the
chapel
and
so
fine
you
would
not
believe
it
well
just
a
hundred
yards
from
there
is
the
house
four
rooms
exactly
what
i
wanted
with
a
garden
for
the
children
to
play
in
quite
quiet
and
fresh
and
pleasant
tell
me
who
the
people
are
their
name
is
smith
if
they
respectable
i
go
back
and
take
it
i
can
afford
the
rent
near
st
roque
they
belong
to
the
church
there
i
daresay
they
are
all
right
said
the
doctor
but
it
is
a
long
way
off
and
inconvenient
and
that
is
just
why
i
want
it
said
nettie
we
never
were
used
to
conveniences
and
none
of
us
want
to
be
much
in
the
town
so
far
as
i
know
it
is
the
very
thing
why
has
not
lunch
come
up
what
do
these
people
mean
susan
by
not
attending
to
their

as

i

it
to
be
ready
at
one
now
it
is
we
ca
have
our
time
wasted
this
dr
edward
please
you
stay
the
doctor
gazed
with
amazement
at
the
little
speaker
nobody
else
had
spoken
a
word
fred
had
nodded
to
him
sullenly
wife
had
sunk
back
on
the
sofa
everybody
seemed
to
recognise
nettie
as
supreme
he
hesitated
it
must
be
confessed
to
put
his
grievances
so
entirely
aside
as
to
sit
down
in
perfect
amity
with
fred
and
his
household
but
to
refuse
to
drive
nettie
to
st
roque
was
impossible
the
blood
rushed
to
the
doctor
face
at
the
thought
what
the
world
of
carlingford
would
say
to
see
his
vehicle
proceeding
down
grange
lane
through
dr
marjoribanks
territories
under
such
circumstances
was
a
question
he
did
not
choose
to
consider
neither
did
he
enter
too
minutely
into
the
special
moment
at
which
his
next
patient
might
be
expecting
him
the
young
man
was
under
the
spell
and
did
not
struggle
against
it
he
yielded
to
the
invitation
which
was
a
command
he
drew
near
the
table
at
which
nettie
without
hesitation
took
the
presiding
place
a
dull
amount
of
conversation
often
interrupted
by
that
lively
little
woman
rose
in
the
uncongenial
party
nettie
cut
up
the
meat
for
those
staring
imps
of
children
did
them
all
up
in
snowy
napkins
kept
them
silent
and
in
order
she
regulated
what
susan
was
to
have
and
which
things
were
best
for
fred
she
appealed
to
dr
edward
perpetually
taking
him
into
her
confidence
in
a
way
which
could
not
fail
to
be
flattering
to
that
young
man
and
actually
reduced
to
the
calmness
of
an
ordinary
friendly
party
this
circle
so
full
of
smouldering
elements
of
commotion
through
all
she
was
so
dainty
so
pretty
her
rapid
fingers
so
shapely
her
eager
talk
so
that
it
was
beyond
the
power
of
mortal
man
to
remain
uninterested
it
was
a
development
of
womankind
unknown
to
dr
rider
bessie
christian
had
exhausted
the
race
for
him
until
now
but
nettie
was
a
thousand
times
more
piquant
than
bessie
christian
he
gazed
and
wondered
and
moralised
secretly
in
his
own
mind
what
was
to
become
of
the
girl
what
could
she
do
you
have
left
some
of
your
things
at
my
house
fred
said
the
doctor
making
an
attempt
to
approach
his
sullen
brother
who
evidently
expected
no
overtures
of
friendship
yes
mrs
rider
you
see
arrived
unexpectedly
said
fred
with
confusion
in
fact
i
knew
nothing
about
it
or
or
i
should
have
told
you
nettie
nettie
thought
it
best
to
come
off
at
once
without
writing
explained
fred
wife
what
was
the
use
of
writing
cried
that
little
person
you
had
written
to
fred
for
six
months
without
ever
getting
an
answer
you
made
everybody
unhappy
round
you
with
your
fears
and
troubles
about
him
i
knew
perfectly
he
was
quite
well
and
enjoying
himself
but
of
course
susan
would
not
be
convinced
so
what
was
there
for
it
but
bringing
her
away
what
else
could
i
do
dr
edward
and
to
leave
the
children
would
have
been
preposterous
in
the
first
place
i
should
have
been
miserable
about
them
and
so
as
soon
as
she
found
fred
was
all
right
would
susan
and
something
would
certainly
have
happened
scarlet
fever
or
something
and
at
the
end
of
all
i
should
have
had
to
go
out
again
to
fetch
them
so
the
shortest
way
was
to
bring
them
at
once
do
you
think
so
and
to
see
us
all
here
so
comfortable
i
am
sure
is
enough
to
repay
any
one
for
the
trouble
fred
do
drink
any
more
beer
nettie
put
out
her
tiny
hand
as
she
spoke
to
arrest
the
bottle
fred
stared
at
her
with
a
dull
red
flush
on
his
face
but
he
gave
in
in
the
most
inexplicable
way
it
seemed
a
matter
of
course
to
yield
to
nettie
the
doctor
amazement
began
to
be
mingled
with
amusement
to
see
how
she
managed
them
all
was
worth
the
sacrifice
of
a
little
time
unconsciously
he
became
more
fraternal
in
his
thoughts
he
spoke
to
foolish
faded
mrs
fred
with
a
total
forgiveness
and
forgetfulness
of
her
spiteful
speech
he
hoped
she
would
like
carlingford
he
said
something
to
the
children
but
it
was
not
easy
to
talk
in
presence
of
that
amazing
family
party
the
existence
of
which
he
had
not
dreamed
of
a
few
days
ago
to
see
his
brother
at
the
head
of
such
a
group
had
in
spite
of
himself
a
wonderful
effect
upon
dr
rider
their
children
of
course
must
be
supported
somehow
who
was
to
do
it
was
their
father
grown
incapable
and
useless
in
the
middle
of
his
days
to
be
forced
into
the
current
of
life
again
was
it
a
vague
faith
in
providence
which
had
brought
the
helpless
household
here
or
was
it
a
more
distinct
if
not
so
elevated
confidence
in
nettie
the
doctor
heart
sank
once
more
within
him
as
he
looked
round
the
table
three
helpless
by
nature
two
equally
helpless
who
ought
in
nature
to
have
been
the
support
of
the
whole
nothing
but
one
bright
ready
little
spirit
between
them
all
and
destitution
and
what
could
nettie
do
to
stave
that
wolf
from
the
door
once
more
dr
rider
countenance
fell
if
the
household
broke
down
in
its
attempt
at
independence
who
had
they
to
turn
to
but
himself
such
a
prospect
was
not
comfortable
when
a
man
works
himself
to
death
for
his
own
family
he
takes
the
pleasure
with
the
pain
but
when
another
family
threatens
to
fall
upon
his
hands
the
prospect
is
naturally
appalling
and
even
if
fred
could
do
anything
what
was
fred
life
undermined
by
evil
habit
to
depend
upon
silence
once
more
fell
over
the
little
company
silence
from
all
but
nettie
and
the
children
who
referred
to
her
naturally
instead
of
to
their
mother
fred
was
sullen
and
his
wife
took
her
cue
from
him
edward
was
uneasy
and
dismayed
family
parties
suddenly
assembled
without
due
warning
are
seldom
greatly
successful
and
even
nettie
could
not
make
immediate
reconciliation
and
fraternal
kindness
out
of
this
chapter
iv
take
me
down
this
long
pretty
road
there
must
be
delicious
houses
inside
the
walls
look
here
drive
slowly
and
let
us
have
a
peep
in
at
this
open
door
said
nettie
how
sweet
and
cosy
and
who
is
that
pretty
young
lady
coming
out
i
saw
her
in
the
chapel
this
morning
oh
added
nettie
with
a
little
sharpness
she
knows
tell
me
who
she
is
that
is
miss
lucy
wodehouse
one
of
our
carlingford
beauties
said
dr
rider
do
you
know
her
very
well
asked
the
inquisitive
nettie
how
she
stares
why
does
she
stare
do
you
suppose
is
there
anything
absurd
about
my
dress
look
here
do
they
wear
bonnets
just
like
this
in
england
so
far
as
i
am
able
to
judge
said
the
doctor
looking
at
the
tiny
head
overladen
with
hair
from
which
the
bonnet
had
fallen
half
off
i
suppose
she
is
surprised
to
see
me
here
drive
on
faster
dr
edward
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
see
fred
has
been
telling
us
a
parcel
of
stories
it
would
be
cruel
to
tell
susan
you
know
for
she
believes
in
him
but
you
may
quite
trust
me
is
your
brother
good
for
anything
dr
edward
do
you
suppose
not
very
much
now
i
fear
said
the
doctor
not
very
much
i
suppose
he
never
was
good
for
much
said
the
indignant
nettie
but
he
was
said
to
be
very
clever
when
he
first
came
out
to
the
colony
i
ca
tell
why
susan
married
him
she
is
very
though
you
would
fancy
her
so
submissive
she
is
one
of
those
people
you
know
who
fall
ill
when
they
are
crossed
and
threaten
to
die
so
that
one
dare
cross
her
now
then
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
he
will
not
go
back
to
the
colony
and
i
do
care
to
do
it
myself
must
i
keep
them
here
miss
underwood
began
the
perplexed
doctor
it
would
save
trouble
to
call
me
nettie
everybody
does
said
his
strange
companion
besides
you
are
my
brother
in
a
kind
of
a
way
and
the
only
person
i
can
consult
with
for
of
course
it
would
not
do
to
tell
one
difficulties
to
strangers
fred
may
not
be
very
much
to
depend
upon
you
know
but
still
he
is
fred
yes
said
the
doctor
with
a
little
still
he
is
fred
but
pardon
me
the
name
suggests
long
aggravations
you
ca
tell
how
often
i
have
had
to
put
up
with
affronts
and
injuries
because
it
was
fred
i
should
like
to
grieve
you
never
mind
about
grieving
me
am
not
in
love
with
him
let
me
hear
all
about
it
said
nettie
dr
rider
paused
a
little
seeing
the
abyss
upon
the
brink
of
which
this
brave
little
girl
was
standing
he
had
not
the
heart
to
aggravate
her
by
telling
the
failures
of
the
past
better
to
soften
the
inevitable
discovery
if
possible
but
his
hesitation
was
quite
apparent
to
nettie
with
considerable
impatience
she
turned
round
upon
him
if
you
think
i
do
know
what
i
am
doing
but
have
gone
into
this
business
like
a
fool
you
are
quite
mistaken
dr
edward
she
said
a
little
sharply
i
see
how
it
is
as
well
as
anybody
can
do
i
knew
how
it
was
when
i
left
the
colony
do
be
alarmed
about
me
do
you
think
i
am
to
be
turned
against
my
own
flesh
and
blood
by
finding
out
their
follies
or
to
grumble
at
the
place
god
put
me
in
nothing
of
the
sort
i
know
the
kind
of
situation
perfectly
but
one
make
the
best
of
it
you
know
and
for
that
reason
tell
me
everything
please
but
miss
underwood
consider
cried
the
doctor
in
consternation
you
are
taking
responsibilities
upon
yourself
which
nobody
could
lay
upon
you
you
young
tender
the
doctor
paused
for
a
word
afraid
to
be
too
complimentary
delicate
why
the
whole
burden
of
this
family
will
come
upon
you
there
is
not
one
able
to
help
himself
in
the
whole
bundle
i
am
shocked
i
am
alarmed
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
do
say
anything
please
said
nettie
i
know
what
i
am
about
do
you
call
this
a
street
or
a
lane
or
what
do
you
call
it
oh
such
nice
houses
should
i
like
to
be
able
to
afford
to
have
one
of
them
and
nurses
and
governesses
and
everything
proper
for
the
children
i
should
like
to
dress
them
so
nicely
and
give
them
such
a
good
education
i
do
know
anything
particular
to
speak
of
myself
i
shall
never
be
able
to
teach
them
when
they
grow
older
if
fred
now
was
only
to
be
trusted
and
would
go
and
work
like
a
man
and
make
something
for
the
children
i
daresay
i
could
keep
up
the
house
but
if
he
wo
do
anything
you
know
it
will
take
us
every
farthing
just
to
live
look
here
dr
edward
i
have
two
hundred
susan
had
the
same
you
know
but
fred
got
all
the
money
when
they
were
married
and
muddled
it
away
now
how
much
can
one
do
in
carlingford
with
three
children
upon
two
hundred
fred
will
be
the
meanest
blackguard
in
existence
cried
the
doctor
if
he
takes
his
living
from
you
he
took
his
living
from
it
appears
said
nettie
coolly
and
did
not
thank
you
much
we
must
make
the
best
of
him
we
ca
help
ourselves
now
there
is
the
pretty
church
and
there
is
our
little
house
come
in
with
me
and
answer
for
me
dr
edward
you
can
say
i
am
your
you
know
and
then
perhaps
we
can
get
into
possession
at
once
for
said
nettie
suddenly
turning
round
upon
the
doctor
with
her
brilliant
eyes
shining
out
quaintly
under
the
little
brow
all
puckered
into
curves
of
foresight
it
is
so
sadly
expensive
living
where
we
are
now
to
look
at
the
creature
thus
flashing
those
shining
eyes
not
without
a
smile
lurking
in
their
depths
upon
him
to
see
the
triumphant
undaunted
undoubting
youthfulness
which
never
dreamt
of
failure
to
note
that
pretty
anxiety
the
look
which
might
have
become
a
bride
in
her
first
troubles
playing
at
housekeeping
and
think
how
desperate
was
the
position
she
had
assumed
how
dreary
the
burden
she
had
taken
upon
her
was
almost
too
much
for
the
doctor
he
did
not
know
whether
to
admire
the
little
heroine
as
or
to
turn
from
her
as
probably
had
the
strange
little
spirit
possessed
a
different
frame
the
latter
was
the
sentiment
which
would
have
influenced
the
unimaginative
mind
of
edward
rider
but
there
was
no
resisting
that
little
brown
titania
with
her
little
head
overladen
with
its
beautiful
hair
her
red
delicate
mouth
closing
firm
and
sweet
above
that
little
decided
chin
her
eyes
which
seemed
to
concentrate
the
light
she
seemed
only
a
featherweight
when
the
bewildered
doctor
helped
her
to
alight
an
undoubted
sprite
and
creature
of
romance
but
to
hear
her
arranging
about
all
the
domestic
necessities
within
and
disclosing
her
future
plans
for
the
children
and
all
the
order
of
that
life
of
which
she
took
the
charge
so
unhesitatingly
bewildered
the
mistress
of
the
house
as
much
as
it
did
the
wondering
doctor
the
two
together
stood
gazing
at
her
as
she
moved
about
the
room
pouring
forth
floods
of
eager
talk
her
words
were
almost
as
rapid
as
her
step
her
foot
light
as
it
was
almost
as
decided
and
firm
as
her
resolutions
she
was
a
wonder
to
behold
as
she
pushed
about
the
furniture
and
considered
how
it
could
be
brightened
up
and
made
more
comfortable
gazing
at
her
with
his
silent
lips
apart
dr
rider
sighed
at
the
word
comfortable
was
she
to
give
her
mind
to
making
fred
and
his
children
comfortable
such
a
creature
as
this
involuntarily
it
occurred
to
edward
that
under
such
ministrations
sundry
changes
might
come
over
the
aspect
of
that
prim
apartment
in
which
he
had
seen
her
first
the
room
with
the
bookcase
and
the
red
curtains
and
the
prints
over
the
mantelpiece
a
very
tidy
comfortable
room
before
any
bewitching
imp
came
to
haunt
it
and
whisper
suspicions
of
its
imperfection
the
doctor
own
retirement
where
he
had
chewed
the
cud
of
sweet
and
bitter
fancies
often
enough
without
much
thought
of
his
surroundings
but
nettie
now
had
taken
possession
of
the
prosaic
place
and
all
unconscious
of
that
spiritual
occupation
was
as
busy
and
as
excited
about
mrs
smith
lodgings
at
st
roque
cottage
as
if
it
were
an
ideal
home
she
was
preparing
and
the
life
to
be
lived
in
it
was
the
brightest
and
most
hopeful
in
the
world
when
dr
rider
reached
home
that
night
and
took
his
lonely
meal
in
his
lonely
room
certain
bitter
thoughts
of
unequal
fortune
occupied
the
young
man
mind
let
a
fellow
be
but
useless
thankless
and
heartless
enough
and
people
spring
up
on
all
sides
to
do
his
work
for
him
said
the
doctor
to
himself
with
a
bitterness
as
natural
as
it
was
untrue
the
more
worthless
a
fellow
is
the
more
all
the
women
connected
with
him
cling
to
him
and
make
excuses
for
him
said
edward
rider
in
his
indignant
heart
mother
and
sister
in
the
past
wife
and
nettie
now
to
think
how
fred
had
secured
for
himself
such
perpetual
ministrations
by
neglecting
all
the
duties
of
life
no
wonder
an
indignant
pang
transfixed
the
lonely
bosom
of
the
virtuous
doctor
solitary
and
unconsoled
as
he
was
laborious
days
knew
no
such
solace
and
as
he
fretted
and
pondered
no

of

christian
perplexed
his
thoughts
he
had
forgotten
that
young
woman
all
his
mind
was
fully
occupied
chafing
at
the
sacrifice
of
nettie
he
was
not
sorry
he
was
angry
to
think
of
her
odd
position
and
the
duties
she
had
taken
upon
herself
what
had
she
to
do
with
those
wretched
children

that
faded

mother
edward
rider
was
supremely
disgusted
he
said
to
himself
with
the
highest
moral
indignation
that
such
a
girl
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
tie
herself
to
such

fate
chapter
st
roque
cottage
was
considered
rather
a
triumph
of
local
architecture
a
carlingford
artist
had
built
it
after
the
church
which
was
one
of
gilbert
scott
churches
and
perfect
in
its
way
so
that
its
gothic
qualities
were
unquestionable
the
only
thing
wanting
was
size
which
was
certainly
an
unfortunate
defect
and
made
this
adaptation
of
ecclesiastical
architecture
to
domestic
purposes
a
very
doubtful
experiment
however
in
bright
sunshine
when
the
abundance
of
light
neutralised
the
want
of
window
all
was
well
and
there
was
still
abundance
of
sunshine
in
carlingford
in
october
three
months
after
the
entrance
of
fred
rider
and
his
family
into
mrs
smith
little
rooms
it
was
a
bright
autumn
day
still
mild
though
with
a
crispness
in
the
air
the
late
season
showing
more
in
the
destitution
of
the
than
in
any
more
sensible
sign
it
was
a
pretty
spot
enough
for
a
roadside
st
roque
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
little
common
over
which
at
the
other
margin
you
could
see
some
white
cottages
natural
to
the
soil
in
a
little
dropped
along
the
edge
of
the
unequal
grass
while
between
the
church
and
the
cottage
ran
the
merest
shadow
of
a
brook
just
enough
to
give
place
and
nutriment
to
three
which
had
been
the
feature
of
the
scene
before
st
roque
was
and
which
now
greatly
helped
the
composition
of
the
little
landscape
and
harmonised
the
new
building
with
the
old
soil
st
cottage
by
special
intervention
of
mr
wentworth
the
perpetual
curate
had
dropped
no
intervening
wall
between
its
garden
and
those
trees
but
not
without
many
fears
had
contented
itself
with
a
wooden
paling
on
the
side
nearest
the
willows
consequently
the
slope
of
grass
at
that
side
which
mrs
smith
was
too
prudent
to
plant
with
anything
that
could
be
abstracted
was
a
pretty
slope
with
the
irregular
willow
shadows
swept
over
it
thin
but
still
presenting
a
pale
obstruction
to
the
flood
of
sunshine
on
this
special
afternoon
there
a
little
group
was
collected
in
full
enjoyment
of
the
warmth
and
the
light
mrs
rider
still
faded
but
no
longer
sat
farther
up
in
the
garden
on
the
green
bench
which
had
been
softened
with
cushions
for
her
use
leisurely
working
at
some
piece
of
needlework
in
lonely
possession
of
the
chrysanthemums
and
michaelmas
daisies
round
her
while
on
the
grass
dropped
over
with
yellow
flecks
of
lightly
loosened
by
every
passing
touch
of
wind
sat
nettie
all
brown
and
bright
working
with
the
most
rapid
fingers
at
a
child
frock
and
minding
with
a
corner
of
her
eye
the
possessor
of
the
same
the
tiny
freddy
an
imp
of
mischief
uncontrollable
by
other
hand
or
look
than
hers
a
little
lower
down
poking
into
the
invisible
brook
through
the
paling
was
the
eldest
boy
silent
from
sheer
delight
in
the
unexpected
pleasure
of
coating
himself
with
mud
without
remark
from
nettie
this
unprecedented
escape
arose
from
the
fact
that
nettie
had
a
visitor
a
lady
who
had
bent
down
beside
her
in
a
attitude
and
was
contemplating
her
with
a
mingled
amaze
and
pity
which
intensified
the
prevailing
expression
of
kindness
in
the
mildest
face
in
the
world
it
was
miss
wodehouse
in
her
soft
dress
and
large
soft
checked
shawl
her
mild
eyes
were
fixed
upon
that
brilliant
brown
creature
all
buoyant
and
sparkling
with
youth
these
wonderful
young
people
perplexed
miss
wodehouse
here
was
another
incomprehensible
specimen
most
incomprehensible
perhaps
of
all
that
had
ever
crossed
her
mild
elderly
horizon
with
bewildering
unintelligible
light
my
dear
said
miss
wodehouse
things
used
to
be
very
different
when
i
was
young
when
we
were
girls
we
thought
about
our
own
pleasures
and
and
vanities
of
all
kinds
said
the
good
woman
with
a
little
sigh
and
indeed
i
ca
think
it
is
natural
still
to
see
you
devoting
yourself
like
this
to
your
sister
family
it
is
wonderful
but
dear
dear
me
it
is
natural
nettie
such
i
do
wish
you
would
speak
said
nettie
with
a
sudden
start
stuff
i
am
only
doing
what
must
be
done
freddy
ca
go
on
wearing
one
frock
for
ever
can
he
does
it
stand
to
reason
would
you
have
me
sit
idle
and
see
the
child
petticoats
drop
to
pieces
i
am
a
colonial
girl
i
do
know
what
people
do
in
england
where
i
was
brought
up
we
were
used
to
be
busy
about
whatever
lay
nearest
to
our
hand
it
is
freddy
frock
said
miss
wodehouse
with
a
little
solemnity
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
and
suppose
you
were
to
marry
what
would
happen
supposing
you
were
to
marry
nettie
it
is
quite
time
enough
to
think
of
that
when
there
is
any
likelihood
of
it
happening
said
nettie
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
it
is
only
idle
people
who
have
time
to
think
of
falling
in
love
and
such
nonsense
when
one
is
very
busy
it
never
comes
into
one
head
why
you
have
never
married
miss
wodehouse
and
when
i
know
that
i
have
everything
i
possibly
could
desire
why
should
i
miss
wodehouse
bent
her
troubled
sweet
old
face
over
the
handle
of
her
parasol
and
did
not
say
anything
for
a
few
minutes
it
is
all
very
well
as
long
as
you
are
young
she
said
with
a
wistful
look
and
somehow
you
young
creatures
are
so
much
handier
than
we
used
to
be
our
little
lucy
you
know
that
i
can
remember
quite
a
baby
i
am
twice
as
old
as
she
is
cried
miss
wodehouse
and
she
is
twice
as
much
use
in
the
world
as
i
well
it
is
all
very
strange
but
dear
you
know
is
natural
all
the
same
it
is
dreadful
to
say
so
it
is
dreadful
to
think
so
cried
nettie
i
know
what
you
mean
not
freddy
frock
to
be
sure
but
only
whole
life
and
heart
should
one
desert
the
only
people
belonging
to
one
in
the
world
because
one
happens
to
have
a
little
income
and
they
have
none
if
one
friends
are
not
very
sensible
is
that
a
reason
why
one
should
go
and
leave
them
is
it
right
to
make
one
escape
directly
whenever
one
feels
one
is
wanted
or
what
do
you
mean
miss
wodehouse
said
the
vehement
girl
that
is
what
it
comes
to
you
know
do
you
imagine
i
had
any
choice
about
coming
over
to
england
when
susan
was
breaking
her
heart
about
her
husband
could
one
let
one
sister
die
do
you
suppose
and
now
that
they
are
all
together
what
choice
have
i
they
ca
do
much
for
each
other
there
is
actually
nobody
but
me
to
take
care
of
them
all
you
may
say
it
is
not
natural
or
it
is
not
right
or
anything
you
please
but
what
else
can
one
do
that
is
the
practical
question
said
nettie
triumphantly
if
you
will
answer
that
then
i
shall
know
what
to
say
to
you
miss
wodehouse
gazed
at
her
with
a
certain
mild
exasperation
shook
her
head
wrung
her
hands
but
could
find
nothing
to
answer
i
thought
so
said
nettie
with
a
little
outburst
of
jubilee
that
is
how
it
always
happens
to
abstract
people
put
the
practical
question
before
them
and
they
have
not
a
word
to
say
to
you
freddy
cut
the
grass
with
the
scissors
do
cut
my
trimmings
they
are
for
your
own
frock
you
little
savage
if
i
were
to
say
it
was
my
duty
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff
you
would
understand
me
miss
wodehouse
but
one
only
says
it
is
one
duty
when
one
has
something
disagreeable
to
do
and
i
am
not
doing
anything
disagreeable
added
the
little
heroine
flashing
those
eyes
which
had
confused
edward
rider
those
brilliant
resolute
obstinate
eyes
always
with
the
smile
of
youth
incredulous
of
evil
lurking
in
them
upon
her
bewildered
adviser
i
am
living
as
i
like
to
live
there
was
a
pause
at
least
there
was
a
pause
in
the
argument
but
not
in
nettie
talk
which
ran
on
in
an
eager
stream
addressed
to
freddy
johnnie
things
in
general
miss
wodehouse
pondered
over
the
handle
of
her
parasol
she
had
absolutely
nothing
to
say
but
thoroughly
unconvinced
and
exasperated
at
nettie
logic
could
not
yet
retire
from
the
field
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
just
now
said
the
gentle
woman
at
last
retiring
upon
that
potent
feminine
argument
but
nettie
think
if
you
were
to
marry
miss
wodehouse
paused
appalled
by
the
image
she
herself
had
conjured
up
marrying
is
really
a
dreadful
business
anyhow
she
added
with
a
sigh
so
few
people
you
know
can
when
they
might
there
is
poor
mr
wentworth
who
brought
me
here
first
unless
he
gets
preferment
poor
fellow
and
there
is
dr
rider
things
are
very
much
changed
from
what
they
used
to
be
in
my
young
days
is
dr
rider
in
the
same
dilemma
i
suppose
of
course
you
mean
dr
edward
cried
nettie
with
a
little
flash
of
mischievous
curiosity
why
he
has
nobody
but
himself
i
should
like
to
know
why
he
marry
that
is
if
anybody
would
have
him
when
he
pleases
tell
me
you
know
he
is
my
miss
wodehouse
had
been
thinking
of
bessie
christian
she
paused
partly
for
dr
rider
sake
partly
because
it
was
quite
contrary
to
decorum
to
suppose
that
bessie
now
mrs
brown
might
possibly
a
year
ago
have
married
somebody
else
she
faltered
a
little
in
her
answer
a
professional
man
never
marries
till
he
has
a
position
said
miss
wodehouse
abstractedly
nettie
lifted
upon
her
eyes
that
danced
with
mischief
and
glee
a
profession
is
as
bad
as
a
family
then
said
the
little
australian
i
shall
remember
that
next
time
you
speak
to
me
on
this
subject
i
am
glad
to
think
dr
edward
with
all
his
prudence
is
disabled
too
when
nettie
had
made
this
unguarded
speech
she
blushed
and
suddenly
in
a
threatening
and
defiant
manner
raised
her
eyes
again
to
miss
wodehouse
face
why
miss
wodehouse
did
not
understand
the
look
nor
put
any
significance
into
the
words
she
rose
up
from
the
grass
and
said
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
she
went
away
pondering
in
her
own
mind
those
singular
new
experiences
of
hers
she
had
never
been
called
upon
to
do
anything
particular
all
her
gentle
life
another
fashion
of
woman
might
have
found
a
call
to
action
in
the
management
of
her
house
or
the
education
of
her
motherless
young
sister
but
miss
wodehouse
had
contented
herself
with
loving
lucy
had
suffered
her
to
grow
up
very
much
as
she
would
without
interference
had
never
taken
a
decided
part
in
her
life
when
anything
had
to
be
done
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
very
inexpert
unready
deeply
embarrassed
with
the
unusual
necessity
nettie
case
so
wonderfully
different
from
anything
she
could
have
conceived
lay
on
her
mind
and
oppressed
her
as
she
went
home
to
grange
lane
as
for
nettie
herself
she
took
her
work
and
her
children
indoors
after
a
while
and
tried
on
the
new
frock
and
scolded
and
rehabilitated
the
muddy
hero
of
the
brook
then
with
those
light
fairy
motions
of
hers
she
spread
the
homely
table
for
tea
called
in
susan
sought
fred
in
his
room
with
a
stinging
word
which
penetrated
even
his
callous
mind
and
made
him
for
the
moment
ashamed
of
himself
nettie
bit
her
red
lip
till
it
grew
white
and
bloodless
as
she
turned
from
fred
door
it
was
not
hard
to
work
for
the
children
to
support
and
domineer
over
susan
but
it
was
hard
for
such
an
alert
uncompromising
little
soul
to
tolerate
that
useless
hulk
that
heavy
encumbrance
of
a
man
for
whom
hope
and
life
were
dead
she
bit
her
lip
as
she
discharged
her
sharp
stinging
arrow
at
him
through
the
door
and
then
went
down
singing
to
take
her
place
at
the
table
which
her
own
hands
had
spread
which
her
own
purse
supplied
with
bread
nobody
there
showed
the
least
consciousness
of
that
latter
fact
nobody
fancied
it
was
anything
but
natural
to
rely
upon
nettie
the
strange
household
demeaned
itself
exactly
as
if
things
were
going
on
in
the
most
regular
and
ordinary
course
no
wonder
that
spectators
outside
looked
on
with
a
wonder
that
could
scarcely
find
expression
and
half
exasperated
half
admiring
watched
the
astonishing
life
of
the
colonial
girl
nobody
watched
it
with
half
the
amount
of
exasperation
which
concentrated
in
the
bosom
of
dr
rider
he
gazed
and
noted
and
observed
everything
with
a
secret
rage
indignation
and
incredulity
impossible
to
describe
he
could
not
believe
it
even
when
it
went
on
before
his
very
eyes
doctor
though
he
was
and
scientific
to
a
certain
extent
edward
rider
would
have
believed
in
witchcraft
in
some
philtre
or
potion
acting
upon
her
mind
rather
than
in
nettie
voluntary
folly
was
it
folly
was
it
heroism
was
it
simple
necessity
as
she
herself
called
it
nobody
could
answer
that
question
the
matter
was
as
incomprehensible
to
miss
wodehouse
as
to
dr
rider
but
not
of
such
engrossing
interest
bessie
christian
after
all
grew
tame
in
the
saxon
composure
of
her
beauty
before
this
brown
sparkling
imperious
creature
to
see
her
among
her
domestic
duties
filled
the
doctor
with
a
smouldering
wrath
against
all
surrounding
her
which
any
momentary
spark
might
set
aflame
chapter
vi
affairs
went
on
in
carlingford
with
the
usual
commonplace
pertinacity
of
human
affairs
notable
events
happened
but
seldom
in
anybody
life
and
matters
rolled
back
into
their
ordinary
routine
or
found
a
new
routine
for
themselves
after
the
ordinary
course
of
humanity
after
the
extraordinary
advent
of
nettie
and
her
strange
household
after
the
of
that
wonderful
little
establishment
with
all
the
amazed
expectation
it
excited
it
was
strange
to
see
how
everything
settled
down
and
how
calmly
the
framework
of
common
life
took
in
that
exceptional
and
picture
prophesied
that
it
never
could
last
that
in
the
very
nature
of
things
some
sudden
crisis
or
collapse
must
ensue
and
the
vain
experiment
prove
a
failure
but
quiet
nature
and
steady
time
prevailed
over
these
moralists
and
their
prophecies
the
winter
went
on
calmly
day
by
day
and
nettie
and
her
dependants
became
legitimate
portions
of
carlingford
society
people
ceased
to
wonder
by
degrees
gradually
the
eyes
of
carlingford
grew
accustomed
to
that
dainty
tiny
figure
sweeping
along
by
mere
impulse
of
cheerful
will
and
ceaseless
activity
the
three
staring
children
the
faded
mother
sometimes
indeed
nettie
too
clear
of
the
necessity
of
her
own
exertions
and
too
simply
bent
upon
her
business
to
feel
any
sentimental
shame
of
her
relations
was
seen
quickening
the
sluggish
steps
of
fred
himself
who
shuffled
along
by
her
side
in
a
certain
flush
of
never
perceptible
upon
him
under
any
other
circumstances
even
fred
was
duly
moved
by
her
vicinity
when
he
saw
other
people
look
at
them
his
bemused
intellect
was
still
alive
enough
to
comprehend
that
people
were
aware
of
his
dismal
dependence
upon
that
fairy
creature
whom
it
was
a
shame
to
think
of
as
the
support
not
only
of
his
deserted
children
but
of
his
own
base
comforts
and
idleness
but
the
spur
though
it
pricked
did
not
goad
him
into
any
action
when
he
got
home
he
took
refuge
in
his
room
in
the
hazy
atmosphere
drugged
with
the
heavy
fumes
of
his
pipe
and
stretched
his
slovenly
limbs
on
his
sofa
and
buried
his
confused
faculties
in
his
old
novel
so
he
lived
day
by
day
circumscribed
in
the
most
dangerous
of
his
indulgences
by
nettie
unhesitating
strictures
and
rules
which
nobody
dared
break
but
unlimited
in
his
indolence
his
novel
and
his
pipe
that
stifling
fire
that
close
room
the
ashes
of
the
pipe
on
the
table
the
listless
shabby
figure
on
the
sofa
were
the
most
dismal
part
of
the
interior
at
st
roque
cottage
so
far
as
it
appeared
to
the
external
eye
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
mrs
fred
spiteful
and
useless
with
her
poor
health
her
selfish
love
her
utter
unreason
dawdling
over
trifling
matters
which
she
never
completed
or
the
three
children
entirely
unrespectful
of
father
and
mother
growing
up
amid
that
wonderful
subversion
of
the
ordinary
rules
of
nature
with
some
loyalty
to
nettie
but
no
reverence
in
them
were
not
as
appalling
companions
to
live
with
nettie
however
did
not
consider
the
matter
as
a
spectator
might
she
did
not
enter
into
it
at
all
as
a
matter
to
be
criticised
they
simply
belonged
to
her
as
they
were
she
knew
their
faults
without
loving
them
less
or
feeling
it
possible
that
faults
could
make
any
difference
to
those
bonds
of
nature
fred
indeed
did
afflict
her
lively
impatient
spirit
she
had
tried
to
quicken
him
into
life
at
first
she
gave
him
up
with
a
certain
frank
scorn
now
and
accepted
her
position
thus
he
was
to
be
all
his
life
long
this
big
cumberer
of
the
ground
nettie
valorous
and
simple
made
up
her
mind
to
it
he
was
fred
that
was
all
that
could
be
said
on
the
subject
and
being
fred
belonged
to
her
and
had
to
be
cared
for
like
the
rest
it
all
grew
into
a
matter
of
routine
as
that
winter
glided
along
outside
and
in
everybody
came
to
take
it
for
granted
miss
wodehouse
who
with
a
yearning
admiration
of
a
creature
so
totally
unlike
herself
came
often
to
visit
nettie
ceased
to
expostulate
almost
ceased
to
wonder
mr
wentworth
no
longer
opened
his
fine
eyes
in
amazement
when
that
household
was
named
mrs
smith
their
landlady
calmly
brought
her
bills
to
nettie
and
forgot
that
it
was
not
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
she
should
be
paid
by
miss
underwood
the
only
persistent
sceptic
was
the
doctor
edward
rider
could
not
would
not
believe
it
he
who
had
so
chafed
under
fred
society
felt
it
beyond
the
bounds
of
human
possibility
that
nettie
could
endure
him
he
watched
with
an
eagerness
which
he
found
it
difficult
to
account
for
to
see
the
first
symptoms
of
disgust
which
must
ere
long
mark
the
failure
of
this
bold
but
foolish
venture
it
occupied
his
mind
a
great
deal
more
than
was
good
for
his
own
comfort
perhaps
more
than
was
best
for
his
patients
though
he
had
few
people
to
visit
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
his
drag
was
seen
to
pass
st
roque
cottage
most
days
in
the
week
and
when
urgent
messages
came
for
dr
rider
in
the
evening
his
little
groom
always
wended
his
way
out
through
the
special
district
of
dr
marjoribanks
to
find
his
master
if
the
doctor
was
not
at
home
not
that
all
this
devotion
assisted
him
much
either
in
increase
of
friendship
with
his
relations
or
in
verification
of
his
auguries
the
disgust
of
the
young
doctor
when
he
saw
his
brother
slovenly
figure
in
his
own
chair
was
nothing
to
his
disgust
now
when
he
saw
that
same
form
so
out
of
accordance
with
the
neat
little
which
presence
made
dainty
and
refined
in
its
homeliness
lounging
in
way
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
with
ordinary
patience
to
fred
and
fred
obtuse
as
he
was
perceived
his
brother
disgust
and
contempt
and
resented
it
sullenly
and
betrayed
his
resentment
to
the
foolish
wife
who
sulked
and
said
spiteful
things
to
edward
it
was
not
a
pleasant
family
group
as
for
nettie
she
was
much
too
fully
occupied
to
give
her
society
or
conversation
to
dr
rider
she
came
and
went
while
he
was
there
busy
about
a
thousand
things
always
alert
decided
uncompromising
not
disinclined
to
snub
either
fred
or
susan
when
opportunity
offered
totally
unconscious
even
of
that
delicacy
with
which
a
high
fantastical
heroine
of
romance
would
have
found
it
necessary
to
treat
her
dependants
it
was
this
unconsciousness
above
all
that
irritated
the
doctor
if
she
had
shown
any
feeling
he
said
to
himself
if
she
had
even
been
grandly
aware
of
sacrificing
herself
and
doing
her
duty
there
would
have
been
some
consolation
in
it
but
nettie
obstinately
refused
to
be
said
to
do
her
duty
she
was
doing
her
own
will
with
an
imperious
distinctness
and
energy
having
her
own
way
displaying
no
special
virtue
but
a
determined
wilfulness
dr
rider
was
half
disgusted
with
nettie
to
see
how
little
disgust
she
showed
of
her
companions
he
was
disappointed
in
her
he
concluded
to
himself
that
she
did
not
show
that
fine
perception
which
he
was
disposed
to
expect
from
so
dainty
a
little
sprite
yet
notwithstanding
all
these
disappointed
expectations
it
is
astonishing
how
he
haunted
that
room
where
the
society
was
so
unattractive
and
bore
mrs
fred
spiteful
speeches
and
suffered
his
eyes
and
his
temper
to
be
vexed
beyond
endurance
by
the
dismal
sight
of
his
brother
the
children
too
worried
their
unfortunate
uncle
beyond
description
he
did
not
dislike
children
as
a
general
rule
mothers
in
the
other
end
of
carlingford
indeed
declared
the
doctor
to
be
wonderfully
tender
and
indulgent
to
his
little
patients
but
those
creatures
with
their
round
staring
eyes
the
calm
remarks
they
made
upon
their
father
slovenly
indolence
and
their
mother
imbecility
their
precocious
and
insubordination
moved
dr
rider
with
a
sharp
prevailing
inclination
intensifying
by
times
almost
into
action
to
whip
them
all
round
and
banish
the
intolerable
brats
out
of
sight
such
was
his
unpaternal
way
of
contemplating
the
rising
hopes
of
his
house
how
nettie
could
bear
it
all
was
an
unceasing
marvel
to
the
doctor
yet
in
spite
of
these
disagreeables
he
went
to
st
roque
all
the
same
one
of
these
winter
evenings
the
doctor
wended
his
way
to
st
cottage
in
a
worse
frame
of
mind
than
usual
it
was
a
clear
frosty
night
very
pleasant
to
be
out
in
though
sharp
and
chill
such
a
night
as
brightens
young
eyes
and
exhilarates
young
hearts
when
all
is
well
with
them
young
rider
could
hear
his
own
footsteps
echoing
along
the
hard
road
and
could
not
but
wonder
in
himself
as
he
drew
near
the
group
of
buildings
which
broke
the
solitude
of
the
way
whether
nettie
too
might
hear
it
and
recognise
the
familiar
step
the
shadow
of
st
roque
fell
cold
over
him
as
he
passed
just
from
that
spot
the
light
in
the
parlour
window
of
the
cottage
became
perceptible
to
the
wayfarer
a
shadow
crossed
the
blind
as
he
came
in
sight
nettie
unquestionably
it
occurred
to
dr
rider
to
remember
with
very
sharp
distinctness
at
that
moment
how
nettie
little
shadow
had
dropped
across
the
sunshine
that
first
morning
when
he
saw
her
in
his
own
room
he
quickened
his
step
unawares
perhaps
nettie
might
be
more
accessible
than
usual
less
shut
in
and
surrounded
by
her
family
he
pictured
to
himself
as
he
went
past
the
willows
which
rustled
faintly
with
their
long
bare
branches
in
the
night
air
that
perhaps
as
he
was
later
than
usual
fred
might
have
retired
to
his
den
and
susan
might
have
gone
to
bear
fred
company
who
knows
and
the
children
might
be
in
bed
the
dreadful
little
imps
and
for
once
a
talk
with
the
strange
little
head
of
the
house
might
comfort
the
young
doctor
fatigued
mind
and
troubled
heart
for
he
was
sadly
fatigued
and
worn
out
what
with
incessant
occupation
and
distracted
thoughts
this
year
had
been
a
very
exhausting
one
for
the
doctor
he
had
fagged
on
through
the
whole
summer
and
autumn
without
any
relaxation
he
had
chafed
over
fred
presence
for
half
of
the
year
and
had
been
occupied
for
the
other
half
with
matters
still
more
absorbing
and
exciting
even
now
his
mind
was
in
a
perpetual
ferment
and
no
comforting
spirit
spoke
quietness
to
his
soul
no
stout
heart
strengthened
his
no
lively
intelligence
animated
his
own
to
worthy
doings
he
was
very
cross
and
fretful
and
knew
himself
to
be
so
that
particular
evening
worried
and
in
want
of
rest
what
a
chance
if
perhaps
he
found
nettie
whose
very
provocations
were
somehow
more
interesting
than
other
people
most
agreeable
and
tranquillising
efforts
all
alone
and
at
leisure
he
went
on
with
some
palpitations
of
hope
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
the
cottage
however
he
found
out
the
delusion
he
was
under
the
children
were
the
first
fact
that
presented
itself
to
his
senses
an
uproar
that
pervaded
the
house
a
novel
tumult
waking
all
the
echoes
glimpses
of
flying
figures
pursuing
each
other
with
brushes
and
mops
and
other
impromptu
weapons
one
astride
upon
the
banisters
of
the
stairs
sliding
down
from
top
to
bottom
another
clinging
now
and
then
in
the
pauses
of
the
conflict
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
doors
by
which
it
swung
back
and
forward
terrible
infants
there
they
all
were
in
a
complete
saturnalia
the
door
of
the
parlour
half
open
all
the
time
and
no
sound
of
nettie
restraining
voice
only
poor
mrs
smith
standing
helpless
in
successions
of
fright
and
exasperation
sometimes
alarmed
for
life
and
limb
sometimes
ready
to
give
the
little
wretches
over
to
all
the
penalties
of
poetic
justice
the
poor
woman
brightened
a
little
when
she
perceived
the
sympathetic
horror
on
the
doctor
face
how
this
exclaimed
young
rider
with
a
sigh
of
dismay
alas
however
it
was
no
quiet
imaginary
conference
no
soothing
glimpse
of
nettie
was
practicable
he
grew
sulky
and
ferocious
under
the
thought
he
seized
the
imp
that
hung
on
the
door
and
set
it
down
summarily
with
a
certain
moral
violence
unable
to
refrain
from
an
admonitory
shake
which
startled
its
sudden
scream
into
a
quavering
echo
of
alarm
do
you
want
to
break
your
neck
sir
cried
the
wrathful
uncle
dr
rider
however
had
to
spring
aside
almost
before
the
words
were
uttered
to
escape
the
encounter
of
a
levelled
at
him
by
his
sweet
little
niece
how
is
this
mrs
smith
cried
the
startled
visitor
with
indignation
raising
his
voice
sufficiently
to
be
quite
audible
through
the
door
bless
you
sir
miss
is
gone
out
to
tea
do
say
nothing
i
begrudge
the
poor
young
lady
a
bit
of
a
holiday
whispered
the
frightened
landlady
under
her
breath
but
i
ca
never
give
in
to
it
again
their
mamma
never
takes
a
bit
of
notice
exceptin
when
they
found
fault
with
lord
to
think
how
blind
some
folks
is
when
it
their
own
but
the
poor
dear
young
lady
she
gone
out
for
a
little
pleasure
only
to
miss
wodehouse
doctor
added
mrs
smith
looking
up
with
a
sudden
start
to
catch
the
stormy
expression
on
the
doctor
face
he
made
no
reply
to
the
troubled
landlady
he
pushed
the
children
aside
and
made
a
stride
into
the
parlour
to
be
sure
if
nettie
was
not
here
what
a
charming
opportunity
to
make
himself
disagreeable
and
give
the
other
two
a
piece
of
his
mind
edward
rider
was
anything
but
perfect
he
decided
on
that
expedient
with
an
angry
satisfaction
since
he
could
not
have
nettie
he
would
at
least
have
this
relief
to
his
feelings
which
was
next
best
the
room
was
full
of
smoke
which
came
in
heavy
puffs
from
fred
pipe
he
himself
lay
stretched
on
the
little
sofa
nettie
sofa
room
the
place
sacred
in
the
doctor
heart
to
that
bright
little
figure
the
one
redeeming
presence
in
this
dismal
household
mrs
fred
sat
dawdling
opposite
her
husband
over
some
wretched
eyes
less
prejudiced
than
those
of
edward
rider
might
have
imagined
this
a
scene
of
coarse
but
not
unpleasant
domestic
comfort
to
him
it
was
a
disgusting
picture
of
and
selfish
miserable
enjoyment
almost
vice
the
very
tobacco
which
polluted
the
atmosphere
of
her
room
was
bought
with
nettie
money
pah
the
doctor
came
in
with
a
silent
pale
concentration
of
fury
and
disgust
scarcely
able
to
compel
himself
to
utter
ordinary
words
of
civility
his
presence
disturbed
the
pair
in
their
stolen
pleasure
fred
involuntarily
put
aside
his
pipe
and
mrs
fred
made
a
little
movement
to
remove
from
the
table
the
glass
from
which
her
husband
had
been
drinking
but
both
recollected
themselves
after
a
moment
the
wife
set
down
the
glass
with
a
little
spiteful
toss
of
her
head
the
husband
with
that
heated
sullen
flush
upon
his
face
relighted
his
pipe
and
put
up
again
on
the
sofa
the
feet
which
at
edward
first
appearance
he
had
withdrawn
from
it
a
sullen
how
d
do
was
all
the
salutation
that
passed
between
them
felt
themselves
found
out
the
visitor
felt
with
rage
and
indignation
that
he
had
found
them
out
defiant
shame
and
resentment
spiteful
passion
and
folly
on
one
side
encountered
the
gaze
of
a
spectator
outside
whose
opinion
could
not
be
mistaken
a
known
critic
and
possible
spy
little
comfort
could
come
from
this
strange
reunion
they
sat
in
uneasy
silence
for
a
few
minutes
mutually
ready
to
fly
at
each
other
mrs
fred
in
her
double
capacity
as
a
woman
and
a
fool
was
naturally
the
first
to
speak
nettie
gone
out
to
tea
said
that
good
wife
i
daresay
mr
edward
we
should
not
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
here
had
you
known
that
only
fred
and
i
were
at
home
it
is
very
seldom
we
have
an
evening
to
ourselves
it
was
too
great
a
pleasure
i
suppose
not
to
be
disturbed
susan
hold
your
confounded
tongue
said
the
ungrateful
fred
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
mrs
rider
said
edward
with
deadly
civility
i
was
not
aware
indeed
of
the
domestic
enjoyment
i
was
likely
to
interrupt
but
if
you
do
want
your
boys
to
break
their
necks
some
one
ought
certainly
to
interfere
outside
there
that
is
exactly
what
i
expected
said
mrs
fred
my
poor
children
ca
have
a
little
amusement
poor
things
but
somebody
must
interfere
with
it
and
my
poor
fred
perhaps
you
have
some
fault
to
find
with
him
mr
edward
oh
i
can
see
it
in
your
looks
so
please
take
your
advantage
now
that
there
nobody
to
be
afraid
of
i
can
tell
you
have
ever
so
many
pleasant
things
just
on
your
lips
to
say
i
wish
you
mind
your
own
business
susan
said
her
husband
who
was
not
a
fool
look
after
these
imps
there
and
let
me
and
edward
alone
nettie
gone
out
you
understand
she
a
wonderful
creature
to
be
sure
but
it
a
blessed
relief
to
get
rid
of
her
for
a
little
a
man
ca
breathe
under
her
sharp
eyes
said
fred
half
apologetic
half
defiant
as
he
breathed
out
a
puff
of
smoke
edward
rider
stared
at
his
brother
speechless
with
rage
and
indignation
he
could
have
rushed
upon
that
listless
figure
and
startled
the
life
half
out
of
the
nerveless
slovenly
frame
the
state
of
mingled
resentment
disappointment
and
disgust
he
was
in
made
every
particular
of
this
aggravating
scene
tell
more
emphatically
to
see
that
heavy
vapour
obscuring
those
walls
which
breathed
of
nettie
to
think
of
this
one
little
centre
of
her
life
which
always
hitherto
had
borne
in
some
degree
the
impress
of
her
womanly
image
so
polluted
and
vulgarised
overpowered
the
young
man
patience
yet
perhaps
he
of
all
men
in
the
world
had
least
right
to
interfere
how
is
it
possible
burst
forth
the
doctor
all
at
once
that
you
can
live
upon
that
creature
fred
if
you
have
the
heart
of
a
mouse
in
that
big
body
of
yours
if
you
are
not
altogether
lost
and
degraded
how
can
you
do
it
and
by
jove
when
all
is
done
to
go
and
fill
the
only
room
she
has
the
only
place
you
have
left
her
with
this
disgusting
smoke
and
noise
as
soon
as
her
back
is
turned
good
heaven
it
sickens
one
to
think
of
it
a
fellow
like
you
as
strong
as
any
hodman
to
let
such
a
creature
sacrifice
herself
to
keep
him
in
bread
and
the
only
bit
of
a
little
place
she
can
sit
down
in
when
she
comes
home
it
too
much
you
know
it
more
than
she
ought
to
bear
and
who
are
you
to
meddle
with
us
and
our
arrangements
cried
mrs
fred
my
husband
is
in
his
own
house
you
would
not
take
us
into
your
house
mr
edward
hold
your
confounded
tongue
i
tell
you
said
fred
slowly
gathering
himself
off
the
sofa
you
a
pretty
fellow
to
speak
you
are
that
would
lend
a
fellow
a
shilling
to
keep
him
from
ruin
you
had
better
remember
where
you
are
in
in
as
susan
says
my
own
house
what
outbreak
of
contempt
might
have
come
from
the
doctor
lips
was
fortunately
lost
at
that
moment
since
a
louder
outcry
than
usual
from
outside
the
screams
of
the
children
and
the
wailings
of
the
landlady
at
length
roused
the
mother
to
the
length
of
going
to
the
door
when
she
was
gone
the
two
brothers
eyed
each
other
threateningly
fred
not
without
a
certain
intolerable
sensation
of
shame
rose
to
knock
his
pipe
upon
the
among
nettie
pretty
girlish
ornaments
somehow
these
aggravations
of
insult
to
her
image
drove
edward
rider
desperate
he
laid
his
hand
on
fred
shoulder
and
shook
him
violently
wake
up
ca
you
wake
up
and
see
what
you
about
cried
the
doctor
ca
you
show
a
little
respect
for
her
at
least
look
here
fred
rider
i
knew
you
could
do
anything
shabby
or
mean
if
it
suited
you
i
knew
you
would
consent
to
hang
a
burden
on
anybody
that
would
take
such
a
weight
upon
them
but
by
jove
i
did
not
think
you
had
the
heart
to
insult
her
after
all
a
man
ca
stand
by
and
see
that
clear
off
your
pipe
and
your
brandy
before
she
comes
or
as
sure
as
i
am
made
of
flesh
and
blood
and
not
the
doctor
threats
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
woeful
procession
into
the
presence
of
the
two
brothers
eyeing
each
other
with
such
lowering
faces
mrs
smith
and
her
husband
entered
carrying
between
them
with
solemn
looks
the
unconscious
freddy
while
his
mother
followed
screaming
and
his
little
brother
and
sister
staring
it
was
some
relief
to
the
doctor
feelings
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
to
rush
to
the
window
and
throw
it
open
admitting
a
gust
of
chill
december
air
penetrating
enough
to
search
to
the
bones
of
the
fireside
loiterer
fred
was
father
enough
to
turn
with
anxiety
to
the
child
but
his
trembling
nervous
fingers
and
bemused
eyes
could
make
nothing
of
the
case
thus
so
suddenly
brought
before
him
he
turned
fiercely
and
vacantly
upon
his
wife
and
demanded
why
everything
was
suffered
to
go
to
ruin
when
nettie
was
away
mrs
fred
screaming
and
terrified
began
to
recriminate
the
pallid
figure
of
the
child
on
the
table
gave
a
certain
air
of
squalid
tragedy
to
the
scene
to
the
sordid
miseries
of
which
the
night
air
coming
in
with
a
rush
chilling
the
group
in
their
indoor
dresses
and
flickering
the
flame
of
the
candles
added
one
other
point
of
dismal
accumulation
the
child
had
dropped
from
his
swing
on
the
door
and
was
stunned
with
the
fall
both
father
and
mother
thought
him
dead
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
but
the
accustomed
and
cooler
eyes
of
the
doctor
perceived
the
true
state
of
affairs
edward
rider
forgot
his
disgust
and
rage
as
he
devoted
himself
to
the
little
patient
not
that
he
loved
the
child
more
but
that
the
habits
of
his
profession
were
strong
upon
him
when
he
had
succeeded
in
restoring
the
little
fellow
to
consciousness
the
doctor
threw
a
professional
glance
of
inquiry
round
him
to
see
who
could
be
trusted
then
with
a
contemptuous
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
impatient
exclamation
turned
back
to
the
table
fred
shivering
and
helpless
stood
by
the
fire
uttering
confused
directions
and
rubbing
miserably
his
own
flabby
hands
his
wife
crying
scolding
and
incapable
stood
at
the
end
of
the
table
offering
no
assistance
but
wondering
when
ever
nettie
would
come
back
dr
rider
took
the
patient
in
his
arms
and
beckoning
mrs
smith
to
go
before
him
carried
the
child
there
the
good
mistress
of
the
cottage
listened
to
all
his
directions
and
promised
devoutly
to
obey
him
to
keep
the
room
quiet
if
she
could
to
tell
everything
he
had
said
to
miss
nettie
he
did
not
enter
the
desecrated
parlour
again
when
he
came
what
was
the
use
he
was
glad
to
go
out
and
escape
the
chance
of
a
fraternal
struggle
he
went
out
into
the
cold
night
air
all
thrilling
with
excitement
and
agitation
it
was
not
wonderful
that
a
scene
so
strange
should
rouse
many
impatient
thoughts
in
the
young
man
mind
but
the
most
intolerable
of
these
had
the
most
trifling
origin
that
fred
should
have
smoked
his
pipe
in
nettie
when
she
was
out
of
the
way
was
not
after
all
considering
fred
character
a
very
wonderful
circumstance
but
it
exasperated
his
brother
to
a
greater
extent
than
much
more
important
matters
that
aggravation
entirely
overpowered
edward
rider
it
seemed
the
culmination
of
all
the
wrong
and
silent
insolent
injury
inflicted
upon
nettie
he
saw
the
stain
of
those
ashes
on
the
little
the
rolling
cloud
of
smoke
in
the
room
and
indignation
burned
yet
higher
and
higher
in
his
breast
when
the
current
of
his
thoughts
was
suddenly
checked
and
stimulated
by
the
sound
of
voices
on
the
road
voices
one
of
which
was
nettie
one
the
lofty
clerical
accents
of
the
rev
frank
wentworth
the
two
were
walking
in
very
confidential
colloquy
as
the
startled
and
jealous
doctor
imagined
what
were
these
two
figures
doing
together
upon
the
road
why
did
nettie
lean
on
the
arm
of
that
handsome
young
clerical
coxcomb
it
did
not
occur
to
dr
rider
that
the
night
was
extremely
dark
and
that
nettie
had
been
at
miss
wodehouse
where
the
curate
of
st
roque
was
a
perpetual
visitor
with
a
mortified
and
jealous
pang
totally
unreasonable
and
totally
irresistible
edward
rider
only
a
moment
before
so
fantastically
extreme
in
nettie
defence
in
the
defence
of
nettie
very
image
from
all
vulgar
contact
and
desecration
strode
past
nettie
now
without
word
or
sign
of
recognition
she
did
not
see
him
as
he
observed
with
a
throbbing
heart
she
was
talking
to
young
mr
wentworth
with
all
the
haste
and
eagerness
which
dr
rider
had
found
so
captivating
she
never
suspected
who
it
was
that
brushed
past
her
with
breathless
exasperated
impatience
in
the
darkness
they
went
on
past
him
talking
laughing
lightly
under
the
veil
of
night
quite
indifferent
as
to
who
heard
them
though
the
doctor
did
not
think
of
that
he
unreasonably
affronted
galled
and
mortified
turned
his
back
upon
that
house
which
at
this
present
disappointed
moment
did
not
contain
one
single
thing
or
person
which
he
could
dwell
on
with
pleasure
and
a
hundred
times
more
discontented
fatigued
and
worn
out
full
of
disgust
with
things
in
general
and
himself
and
his
own
fate
in
particular
than
he
had
been
when
he
set
out
from
the
other
end
of
carlingford
went
sulkily
and
at
a
terrific
pace
past
the
long
of
grange
lane
and
all
dr
marjoribanks
genteel
patients
when
he
had
reached
home
he
found
a
message
waiting
him
from
an
urgent
invalid
whose
case
kept
the
unhappy
doctor
up
and
busy
for
half
the
night
such
was
the
manner
in
which
edward
rider
got
through
the
evening
the
one
wonderful
exceptional
evening
when
nettie
went
out
to
tea
chapter
vii
with
the
dawn
of
the
morning
however
and
the
few
hours
hurried
rest
which
edward
rider
was
able
to
snatch
after
his
labours
other
sentiments
arose
in
his
mind
it
was
quite
necessary
to
see
how
the
unlucky
child
was
at
st
roque
cottage
and
perhaps
what
nettie
thought
of
all
that
had
occurred
during
her
absence
the
doctor
bethought
himself
too
that
there
might
be
very
natural
explanations
of
the
escort
how
else
to
be
sure
could
she
have
got
home
on
a
dark
winter
night
through
that
lonely
road
perhaps
if
he
himself
had
been
less
impatient
and
it
might
have
fallen
to
his
lot
to
supersede
mr
wentworth
on
the
whole
dr
rider
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
one
of
his
earliest
calls
this
morning
at
st
roque
it
was
a
foggy
frosty
day
brightened
with
a
red
sun
which
threw
wintry
ruddy
rays
across
the
mist
dr
rider
drew
up
somewhat
nervously
at
the
little
gothic
porch
he
was
taken
to
the
bedroom
where
little
freddy
lay
moaning
and
feverish
a
distant
hum
came
from
the
other
children
in
the
parlour
the
door
of
which
however
was
fast
closed
this
morning
and
nettie
herself
sat
by
the
child
bedside
nettie
all
alert
and
vigorous
in
the
little
room
which
homely
as
its
aspect
was
displayed
even
to
the
doctor
uninitiated
glance
a
fastidious
nicety
of
arrangement
which
made
it
harmonious
with
that
little
figure
nettie
was
singing
childish
songs
to
solace
the
little
invalid
retirement
the
fox
that
jumped
up
on
a
moonlight
night
the
frog
that
would
go
classic
ditties
of
which
the
nursery
never
tires
the
doctor
who
was
not
aware
that
music
was
one
of
nettie
accomplishments
stopped
on
the
stairs
to
listen
and
indeed
she
had
not
a
great
deal
of
voice
and
still
less
science
nettie
life
having
been
too
entirely
occupied
to
leave
much
room
for
such
studies
yet
somehow
her
song
touched
the
doctor
heart
he
forgave
her
entirely
that
walk
with
the
curate
he
went
in
softly
less
impatient
than
usual
with
her
crazy
quixotism
a
child
a
sick
child
especially
was
a
bearable
adjunct
to
the
picture
a
woman
could
be
forgiven
for
such
necessary
ministrations
actually
to
tell
the
truth
could
be
forgiven
most
follies
she
might
happen
to
do
when
one
could
have
her
to
one
self
without
the
intervention
of
such
dreary
accessories
as
susan
and
fred
thank
you
very
much
for
your
care
of
this
child
last
night
dr
edward
said
the
prompt
nettie
laying
down
the
large
piece
of
very
plain
needlework
in
her
hand
i
always
said
though
you
do
make
a
fuss
about
the
children
that
you
were
quite
to
be
relied
on
if
anything
should
happen
he
is
feverish
but
he
is
not
ill
and
so
long
as
i
tell
him
stories
and
keep
beside
him
freddy
is
the
best
child
in
the
world
more
people
than
freddy
might
be
willing
to
be
ill
under
such
conditions
said
the
doctor
complimentary
but
rueful
he
felt
his
patient
pulse
and
prescribed
for
him
with
a
softened
voice
he
lingered
and
looked
round
the
room
which
was
very
bare
yet
somehow
was
not
like
any
of
the
rooms
in
house
how
was
it
there
were
no
ornaments
about
excepting
that
tiny
little
figure
with
the
little
head
overladen
with
such
a
wealth
of
beautiful
hair
the
doctor
sighed
in
this
little
sacred
spot
where
she
was
so
clearly
at
her
post
or
at
least
at
a
post
which
no
other
was
at
hand
to
take
he
could
not
even
resent
nettie
he
gave
in
to
her
here
with
a
sigh
since
you
think
he
is
not
ill
to
speak
of
will
you
drive
me
and
the
other
children
into
carlingford
dr
edward
said
the
courageous
nettie
it
will
be
a
pleasure
for
them
you
know
and
i
shall
be
able
to
do
my
business
without
losing
so
much
time
besides
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
can
see
you
will
in
your
eyes
go
down
please
and
talk
to
mr
smith
who
has
got
a
headache
or
something
and
wants
to
see
you
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
seeing
susan
who
is
cross
of
course
i
do
wonder
at
her
being
cross
it
must
be
very
shocking
you
know
to
feel
self
of
no
use
whatever
happens
thank
you
i
shall
be
ready
in
a
minute
as
soon
as
you
have
done
talking
to
mr
smith
the
doctor
went
down
obediently
and
in
an
unusual
flutter
of
pleasure
to
see
the
master
of
the
cottage
totally
indifferent
to
the
ailments
of
the
virtuous
smith
and
thinking
only
of
nettie
and
that
drive
to
carlingford
where
indeed
he
should
not
have
gone
had
he
considered
the
merely
abstract
matters
of
business
and
duty
which
led
him
entirely
in
a
different
direction
he
was
somewhat
rudely
recalled
to
himself
when
he
went
smith
had
no
headache
but
only
wanted
to
speak
to
the
doctor
about
his
lodgers
whose
ways
were
sadly
discomposing
to
himself
and
his
wife
you
saw
how
it
was
yourself
last
night
sir
said
the
troubled
landlady
them
hangings
you
know
the
smoke
goes
through
and
through
them
after
leaving
all
the
windows
open
this
frosty
morning
and
a
draught
enough
to
give
you
your
death
the
place
smells
like
i
know
what
if
it
was
for
miss
i
would
put
up
with
it
for
a
day
and
the
gentleman
own
room
doctor
if
you
was
just
to
go
in
and
see
it
just
put
your
head
in
and
say
good
morning
you
believe
me
i
know
all
about
it
said
the
doctor
but
miss
underwood
mrs
smith
there
where
it
is
sir
said
the
landlady
i
ca
find
it
in
my
heart
to
say
a
word
to
miss
to
see
how
she
do
manage
them
all
to
be
sure
but
for
all
that
doctor
it
stands
to
reason
as
one
ca
spoil
one
lodgings
for
a
family
as
may
be
gone
not
except
considered
in
the
rent
it
more
to
speak
to
a
gentleman
like
you
as
knows
the
world
than
to
a
young
lady
as
one
has
a
word
to
say
against
the
handiest
liveliest
managingest
ah
doctor
make
a
deal
different
a
wife
from
her
sister
that
young
lady
would
though
it
is
my
part
to
say
nothink
considering
all
things
and
that
you
relations
like
but
smith
and
me
are
both
o
one
mind
about
it
dr
rider
unless
it
considered
in
the
rent
or
the
gentleman
drops
smoking
or
i
hear
miss
underwood
coming
cried
young
rider
next
time
i
come
we
arrange
it
all
but
not
a
word
to
remember
not
a
syllable
and
go
and
look
after
that
poor
child
there
a
good
soul
she
trusts
you
while
she
is
gone
and
so
do
i
there
there
another
time
i
take
the
responsibility
of
satisfying
you
mrs
smith
said
the
doctor
in
a
prodigious
hurry
ready
to
promise
anything
in
this
incautious
moment
and
bolting
out
of
their
little
dark
which
the
local
architect
mullions
had
converted
into
a
kind
of
condemned
cell
nettie
stood
at
the
door
all
ready
for
her
expedition
to
carlingford
with
her
two
children
and
calmly
inquisitive
but
no
longer
noisy
mrs
fred
was
standing
sulky
at
the
parlour
door
the
doctor
took
off
his
hat
to
her
as
he
helped
nettie
into
the
front
seat
of
the
drag
but
took
care
not
to
approach
nearer
the
children
were
packed
in
behind
under
charge
of
the
little
groom
and
with
an
exhilarating
sensation
of
lawlessness
in
the
present
pleasure
dr
rider
turned
his
back
upon
his
duty
and
the
patient
who
expected
him
a
mile
on
the
other
side
of
st
roque
and
drove
not
too
rapidly
into
carlingford
mrs
smith
was
talking
to
you
of
us
said
nettie
flashing
her
penetrating
eyes
upon
the
confused
doctor
i
know
she
was
i
could
see
it
in
her
face
this
morning
and
in
yours
when
you
came
out
of
her
room
dreadful
little
dungeon
is
it
not
i
wonder
what
the
man
meant
to
build
such
a
place
do
they
want
to
turn
us
out
dr
edward
or
do
they
want
more
rent
i
am
not
surprised
i
am
sure
after
last
night
was
it
not
odious
of
fred
to
go
and
smoke
in
the
parlour
the
only
place
we
can
have
tidy
but
it
is
no
use
speaking
to
him
you
know
nor
to
susan
either
for
that
matter
married
people
do
stand
up
for
each
other
so
when
you
say
a
word
however
they
may
fight
between
themselves
but
is
it
more
rent
they
want
dr
edward
for
i
ca
afford
more
rent
it
is
an
abominable
shame
you
ought
to
afford
anything
it
is
too
dreadful
to
think
of
cried
the
angry
doctor
involuntarily
touching
his
horse
with
his
whip
in
the
energy
of
the
moment
though
he
was
indeed
in
no
hurry
to
reach
carlingford
hush
said
nettie
lifting
her
tiny
hand
as
though
to
put
it
to
his
incautious
mouth
which
indeed
the
doctor
would
not
have
objected
to
we
shall
quarrel
on
that
subject
if
you
say
anything
more
so
it
is
better
to
stop
at
once
nobody
has
a
right
to
interfere
with
me
this
is
my
business
and
no
one
else
has
anything
to
do
with
it
you
mistake
cried
the
doctor
startled
out
of
all
his
prudences
it
ought
to
be
my
business
quite
as
much
as
it
is
yours
nettie
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
careless
scorn
of
the
inferior
creature
ah
yes
i
daresay
but
then
you
are
only
a
man
said
nettie
and
the
girl
elevated
that
pretty
drooping
head
and
flashed
a
whole
torrent
of
brilliant
reflections
over
the
sombre
figure
beside
her
he
felt
himself
glow
under
the
sudden
radiance
of
the
look
to
fancy
this
wilful
imperious
creature
a
meek
heroine
was
equally
absurd
and
impossible
was
there
any
virtue
at
all
in
that
dauntless
enterprise
of
hers
or
was
it
simple
determination
to
have
her
own
way
but
not
to
quarrel
said
nettie
for
indeed
you
are
the
only
person
in
the
world
i
can
say
a
word
to
about
the
way
things
are
going
on
she
added
with
a
certain
momentary
softening
of
voice
and
twinkling
of
her
eyelid
as
if
some
moisture
had
gathered
there
i
think
fred
is
in
a
bad
way
i
think
he
is
muddling
his
brains
with
that
dreadful
life
he
leads
to
think
of
a
man
that
could
do
hundreds
of
things
living
like
that
a
woman
you
know
can
only
do
a
thing
or
two
here
and
there
if
it
were
not
wicked
to
say
so
one
would
think
almost
that
providence
forgot
sometimes
and
put
the
wrong
spirit
into
a
body
that
did
not
belong
to
it
do
you
think
so
when
i
look
at
fred
i
declare
sometimes
i
could
take
hold
of
him
and
give
him
a
good
shake
and
ask
him
what
he
means
and
then
it
all
seems
so
useless
the
very
idea
of
expecting
him
to
feel
anything
i
want
to
know
what
you
said
to
him
last
night
not
much
not
half
so
much
as
i
meant
to
have
said
to
see
him
polluting
your
room
cried
the
doctor
with
a
flush
growing
on
his
face
and
breaking
off
abruptly
not
quite
able
to
conclude
the
sentence
nettie
gave
him
a
shy
upward
glance
and
grew
suddenly
crimson
too
did
you
mind
said
nettie
with
a
momentary
timidity
against
the
unexpected
charm
of
which
the
unhappy
doctor
fell
defenceless
then
holding
out
her
tiny
hand
to
him
with
shy
frankness
thank
you
for
caring
so
much
for
me
said
the
dauntless
little
girl
resolute
not
to
perceive
anything
which
could
not
be
fully
spoken
out
caring
much
i
must
speak
to
you
we
ca
go
on
like
this
nettie
cried
the
doctor
holding
fast
the
little
unfaltering
hand
oh
here
is
the
place
i
am
going
to
please
do
people
might
not
understand
though
we
brother
and
sister
in
a
kind
of
a
way
said
the
little
australian
please
dr
edward
we
must
get
out
here
for
a
moment
edward
rider
hesitated
with
a
wild
intention
of
urging
his
horse
forward
and
carrying
her
off
anywhere
out
of
carlingford
out
of
duty
and
practice
and
responsibility
and
all
those
galling
restraints
of
life
which
the
noonday
light
and
everyday
sounds
about
brought
in
with
so
entire
a
discord
to
break
up
this
momentary
hallucination
for
half
a
minute
only
the
doctor
lingered
on
the
borders
of
that
fairyland
where
time
and
duty
are
not
but
only
one
ineffable
moment
always
passing
never
past
then
with
a
long
sigh
the
breath
of
which
dispersed
a
whole
gleaming
world
of
visionary
delights
he
got
down
doggedly
on
the
commonplace
pavement
ah
what
a
descent
it
was
the
moment
his
foot
touched
these
vulgar
flags
he
was
once
more
the
doctor
at
everybody
command
with
a
fretful
patient
waiting
for
him
a
mile
beyond
st
roque
and
all
these
dazzling
moments
which
had
rapt
the
unfortunate
young
fellow
into
another
world
were
so
much
time
lost
to
the
prose
figure
that
had
to
help
nettie
down
and
let
her
go
and
betake
himself
soberly
about
his
own
business
perhaps
nettie
felt
it
a
little
disenchanting
too
when
she
was
dropped
upon
the
bare
street
and
went
into
the
common
shop
and
saw
the
doctor
drag
flash
off
in
the
red
frosty
sunshine
with
a
darting
movement
of
exasperation
and
impatience
on
the
part
of
its
aggravated
driver
for
once
in
her
life
nettie
felt
disposed
to
be
impatient
with
the
children
who
unceremoniously
ejected
from
their
perch
behind
were
not
in
the
most
obedient
frame
of
mind
the
two
young
people
possibly
agreed
in
their
mutual
sentiment
of
disgust
with
other
people
society
just
at
that
moment
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
dr
rider
galloped
his
horse
to
his
patient
door
and
took
it
out
of
that
unlucky
individual
who
was
fortunately
strong
enough
to
be
able
to
bear
sharp
practice
nettie
when
she
had
made
her
little
purchases
walked
home
smartly
to
sing
the
fox
jumped
up
on
a
moonlight
night
to
little
freddy
in
his
bedroom
this
kind
of
interlude
however
as
all
young
men
and
maidens
ought
to
be
aware
answers
much
better
in
the
evening
when
a
natural
interval
of
dreams
interposes
between
it
and
the
common
work
of
existence
nettie
decided
thinking
on
it
that
this
would
never
do
she
made
up
her
mind
not
to
have
any
more
drives
with
the
doctor
there
was
no
telling
what
such
proceedings
might
lead
to
they
were
distinctly
incompatible
with
the
more
serious
business
of
her
life
chapter
viii
such
a
parting
however
is
sadly
apt
to
lead
to
future
meetings
notwithstanding
his
smouldering
quarrel
with
fred
which
was
always
ready
to
burst
out
afresh
dr
rider
would
not
give
up
coming
to
st
roque
he
came
to
some
clandestine
arrangement
with
mrs
smith
of
which
nobody
ever
was
aware
and
which
he
himself
was
rather
ashamed
of
than
otherwise
and
he
attended
freddy
with
the
most
dutiful
exactness
till
the
child
was
quite
restored
but
all
this
time
nettie
put
on
a
coat
of
armour
and
looked
so
thoroughly
unlike
herself
in
her
unusual
reserve
and
propriety
that
the
doctor
was
heartily
discouraged
and
could
go
no
further
besides
it
would
not
be
positively
correct
to
assert
that
though
he
would
gladly
have
carried
her
off
in
the
drag
anywhere
to
the
end
of
the
world
in
the
enchantment
of
the
moment
he
was
just
as
ready
to
propose
setting
up
a
new
household
with
fred
and
his
family
hanging
on
to
it
as
natural
dependants
that
was
a
step
the
doctor
was
not
prepared
for
some
people
are
compelled
to
take
the
prose
concerns
of
life
into
full
consideration
even
when
they
are
in
love
and
edward
rider
was
one
of
these
unfortunate
individuals
the
boldness
which
puts
everything
to
the
touch
to
gain
or
lose
was
not
in
this
young
man
he
had
been
put
to
hard
encounters
enough
in
his
day
and
had
learned
to
trust
little
to
chance
or
good
fortune
he
did
not
possess
the
boldness
which
disarms
an
adverse
fate
nor
that
confidence
in
his
own
powers
which
smooths
down
wounded
pride
and
accounts
even
for
failure
he
was
perhaps
it
is
only
right
to
say
not
very
capable
of
heroism
but
he
was
capable
of
seeing
the
lack
of
the
heroic
in
his
own
composition
and
of
feeling
bitterly
his
own
and
the
remarks
of
the
world
which
is
always
so
ready
to
taunt
the
very
cowardice
it
creates
after
that
moment
in
which
he
could
have
dared
anything
for
her
and
with
her
it
is
sad
to
be
obliged
to
admit
that
perhaps
dr
edward
too
like
nettie
withdrew
a
little
from
that
climax
of
feeling
not
that
his
heart
grew
colder
or
his
sentiments
changed
but
only
that
in
sight
of
the
inevitable
result
the
poor
young
fellow
paused
and
pondered
obeying
the
necessity
of
his
nature
people
who
jump
at
conclusions
if
they
have
to
bear
the
consequences
of
folly
often
enough
are
at
least
spared
those
preliminary
heartaches
dr
rider
eager
as
love
and
youth
could
make
him
was
yet
incapable
of
shutting
his
eyes
to
the
precipice
at
his
feet
that
he
despised
himself
for
doing
so
did
not
make
the
matter
easier
these
were
the
limits
of
his
nature
and
beyond
them
he
could
not
pass
accordingly
matters
went
on
in
this
dangerous
fashion
for
many
weeks
longer
the
fire
smouldered
strengthening
its
flames
day
by
day
malicious
sprites
of
thought
went
out
behind
dr
rider
in
his
drag
leading
him
into
the
wildest
calculations
the
most
painful
complication
of
schemes
if
fred
and
his
family
could
only
be
persuaded
to
return
to
australia
his
brother
thought
if
any
bribe
within
edward
means
could
tempt
the
ruined
man
to
such
a
step
and
when
he
was
there
why
there
was
providence
to
take
care
of
the
helpless
unlovely
household
and
necessity
might
compel
the
wretched
father
to
work
for
his
children
such
were
the
vain
projects
that
revolved
and
fermented
through
the
doctor
agitated
brain
as
he
went
among
his
patients
luckily
he
had
a
very
favourable
and
lot
of
sick
people
at
that
crisis
they
all
got
well
in
spite
of
the
doctor
and
gave
their
own
special
cases
and
his
anxiety
all
the
credit
for
his
grave
looks
and
all
these
streets
and
rough
new
roads
in
the
east
end
of
carlingford
were
sown
thick
with
the
bootless
suggestions
of
dr
love
and
fears
the
crop
did
not
show
upon
the
vulgar
soil
but
gave
lurking
associations
to
every
street
corner
which
he
passed
in
his
rounds
many
a
day
after
and
served
at
this
present
momentous
era
to
confuse
doubly
the
chaos
of
his
thoughts
at
last
one
night
the
crisis
came
spring
had
begun
to
show
faintly
in
the
lengthening
days
spring
that
so
often
belies
itself
and
comes
with
a
serpent
tooth
dr
rider
on
that
particular
day
had
met
dr
marjoribanks
at
some
meeting
convened
in
the
interests
of
carlingford
the
old
physician
had
been
very
gracious
and
cordial
to
the
young
one
had
spoken
of
his
own
declining
health
of
his
possible
retirement
of
the
excellent
prospects
which
a
rising
young
man
in
their
profession
had
in
carlingford
and
finally
had
asked
dr
rider
to
go
with
him
next
day
to
see
an
interesting
patient
and
advise
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
case
the
young
doctor
was
more
pleased
than
he
could
or
would
have
told
any
one
and
with
a
natural
impulse
seized
the
earliest
moment
to
direct
his
steps
towards
st
roque
it
was
twilight
when
dr
edward
went
down
the
long
and
rather
tiresome
line
of
grange
lane
these
so
delicious
in
their
bowery
retirements
within
were
not
interesting
outside
to
the
pedestrian
but
the
doctor
attention
was
so
speedily
riveted
on
two
figures
eagerly
talking
near
mr
wodehouse
that
the
long
sweep
of
wall
seemed
but
a
single
step
to
him
as
he
hurried
along
those
two
figures
were
unquestionably
nettie
for
one
and
mr
wentworth
for
another
handsome
young
coxcomb
with
all
his
puseyitical
pretences
was
lucy
wodehouse
not
enough
for
him
that
he
must
have
nettie
too
dr
rider
hurried
forward
to
interrupt
that
meeting
he
was
actually
turning
with
her
walking
slowly
back
again
the
very
way
he
had
just
come
blood
boiled
in
his
impatient
veins
he
swept
along
in
a
whirlwind
of
sudden
wrath
when
he
came
up
to
them
nettie
was
talking
low
and
the
curate
lofty
head
was
bent
to
hear
her
in
a
manner
which
it
is
probable
lucy
wodehouse
would
no
more
have
admired
than
edward
rider
they
came
to
a
sudden
pause
when
he
joined
them
in
that
particular
conversation
the
doctor
dread
civility
did
not
improve
matters
without
asking
himself
what
cause
he
had
this
amiable
young
man
plunged
into
the
wildest
jealousy
without
pause
or
interval
he
bestowed
upon
nettie
the
most
cutting
looks
the
most
overwhelming
politeness
when
the
three
had
marched
solemnly
abreast
down
the
road
for
some
few
minutes
the
curate
perhaps
with
an
intuition
of
perceiving
how
the
matter
was
stopped
short
and
said
i
will
make
inquiries
and
let
you
know
next
time
i
pass
the
cottage
said
mr
wentworth
and
he
and
the
doctor
took
off
their
hats
not
without
deadly
thoughts
on
one
side
at
least
when
the
young
clergyman
left
them
nettie
and
her
sulky
cavalier
went
on
in
silence
that
intrepid
little
woman
was
not
in
her
usual
spirits
it
appeared
she
had
no
talk
for
dr
edward
any
more
than
he
had
for
her
she
carried
a
multiplicity
of
little
parcels
in
her
hands
and
walked
with
a
certain
air
of
fatigue
the
doctor
walked
on
stealing
silent
looks
at
her
till
his
heart
melted
but
the
melting
of
his
heart
displayed
itself
characteristically
he
would
not
come
down
from
his
elevation
without
suffering
her
to
see
how
angry
he
was
i
fear
i
interrupted
an
interesting
conversation
i
that
have
so
little
hope
of
equalling
mr
wentworth
priests
are
always
infallible
with
women
said
the
doctor
betraying
his
in
vulgar
sneers
i
was
asking
him
for
some
one
to
teach
the
boys
said
nettie
johnnie
ought
to
have
his
education
attended
to
now
mr
wentworth
is
very
dr
edward
though
he
was
just
going
to
knock
at
miss
wodehouse
door
when
i
met
him
he
offered
and
would
have
done
it
if
you
had
not
come
up
to
walk
home
with
me
not
that
i
wanted
anybody
to
walk
home
with
me
but
it
was
very
kind
said
nettie
with
rising
spirit
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
very
poor
substitute
for
mr
wentworth
said
the
jealous
doctor
and
i
do
pretend
to
be
kind
but
i
am
surprised
to
find
miss
underwood
walking
so
late
this
is
not
a
road
for
a
lady
by
herself
you
know
i
do
mind
in
the
least
for
the
road
said
nettie
with
a
little
indignation
how
wonderfully
cross
you
are
sometimes
if
you
are
going
as
far
as
the
cottage
she
added
with
a
little
sigh
of
fatigue
will
you
please
carry
some
of
these
things
for
me
i
could
not
get
out
sooner
i
have
been
so
busy
it
is
wonderful
how
much
needlework
it
takes
to
keep
three
children
going
and
how
many
little
jobs
there
are
to
do
if
you
take
this
parcel
carry
it
carefully
please
it
is
something
for
my
bonnet
there
do
be
absurd
i
am
quite
able
to
walk
by
myself
thank
you
i
rather
please
this
remonstrance
was
called
forth
by
the
fact
that
the
relenting
doctor
much
moved
by
having
the
parcels
confided
to
his
care
had
drawn
the
little
hand
which
gave
them
within
his
arm
a
proceeding
which
nettie
distinctly
disapproved
of
she
withdrew
her
hand
quickly
and
walked
on
with
much
dignity
by
his
side
i
can
carry
your
parcels
said
edward
after
a
little
pause
but
you
will
not
let
me
help
yourself
you
take
the
heaviest
burdens
upon
your
shoulders
and
then
will
have
no
assistance
in
bearing
them
how
long
are
these
children
of
fred
detestable
little
imps
to
work
you
to
death
you
are
speaking
of
children
sir
cried
nettie
with
a
little
blaze
of
resentment
but
you
do
mean
it
dr
edward
she
said
a
moment
after
in
a
slightly
coaxing
tone
you
are
tired
and
cross
after
your
day
work
perhaps
it
will
be
best
if
you
are
very
cross
not
to
come
down
all
the
way
to
the
cottage
thank
you
i
do
want
you
to
quarrel
with
fred
cross
nettie
you
are
enough
to
drive
twenty
men
distracted
cried
the
poor
doctor
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
what
i
have
been
dying
to
say
to
you
these
three
months
past
and
to
see
you
go
on
with
these
confounded
children
without
so
much
as
a
glance
for
a
fellow
who
do
speak
like
that
cried
nettie
with
brilliant
female
instinct
you
be
sorry
for
it
after
for
you
know
dr
edward
you
have
said
anything
particular
to
me
these
three
months
past
this
touch
gave
the
last
exasperation
to
the
agitated
mind
of
the
doctor
he
burst
forth
into
a
passionate
outbreak
of
love
and
anger
curiously
mingled
but
too
warm
and
real
to
leave
nettie
much
coolness
of
observation
under
the
circumstances
she
took
the
advantage
over
him
which
a
woman
naturally
does
in
such
a
case
she
went
on
softly
trembling
sufficiently
to
her
own
consciousness
but
not
to
his
suffering
him
to
pour
out
that
torrent
without
interruption
she
made
no
answer
till
the
whole
agitated
was
complete
in
the
interval
she
got
a
little
command
of
herself
and
was
able
to
speak
when
it
came
to
her
turn
dr
edward
said
nettie
solemnly
you
know
it
is
impossible
if
we
cared
for
each
other
ever
so
much
what
could
we
do
i
am
not
free
to
to
make
any
change
and
i
know
very
well
and
so
do
you
that
you
never
could
put
up
with
fred
and
susan
and
the
children
were
things
as
you
say
ten
times
over
i
do
mean
i
do
believe
you
i
do
mean
i
might
not
have
been
pleased
had
things
been
different
but
you
know
it
is
just
plainly
impossible
you
know
your
own
temper
and
your
own
spirit
and
perhaps
you
know
mine
as
well
no
no
we
can
not
manage
it
anyhow
dr
edward
said
nettie
with
a
little
sigh
is
this
all
you
have
to
say
to
me
cried
the
astonished
lover
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
what
else
to
say
said
nettie
with
distinctness
i
do
need
to
enter
into
all
the
business
again
and
tell
you
how
things
stand
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
one
may
be
sorry
but
one
must
do
what
one
has
to
do
all
the
same
a
painful
pause
followed
nettie
with
all
her
feminine
acuteness
could
not
divine
that
this
calm
way
of
treating
a
business
which
had
wrought
her
companion
into
such
a
pitch
of
passion
was
the
most
humiliating
and
mortifying
possible
to
a
man
in
whose
bosom
love
and
pride
were
so
combined
he
tried
to
speak
more
than
once
but
could
not
nettie
said
nothing
more
she
was
uneasy
but
secure
in
the
necessity
of
her
own
position
what
else
could
she
do
or
say
then
i
presume
this
is
my
answer
said
the
doctor
at
last
gulping
an
amount
of
shame
and
anger
which
nettie
could
not
conceive
of
and
which
the
darkness
concealed
from
her
sight
oh
dr
edward
what
can
i
say
cried
the
girl
you
know
it
all
as
well
as
i
do
i
can
not
change
it
with
a
word
i
am
very
very
sorry
said
nettie
faltering
and
startled
waking
to
a
sudden
perception
of
the
case
all
at
once
by
reason
of
catching
a
sudden
gleam
of
his
eyes
they
came
to
a
dead
stop
opposite
each
other
she
half
frightened
and
confused
he
desperate
with
love
and
rage
and
mortification
by
this
time
they
had
almost
reached
the
cottage
door
do
take
the
trouble
to
be
sorry
i
oh
i
get
over
it
cried
the
doctor
with
a
sneer
at
himself
and
his
passion
which
came
out
of
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
then
after
a
pause
nettie
cried
the
young
man
nettie
do
you
see
what
you
are
doing
do
you
choose
fred
and
those
wretched
imps
instead
of
your
own
life
and
mine
you
are
not
so
indifferent
as
you
think
you
are
we
shall
never
get
over
it
neither
you
nor
me
nettie
once
for
all
is
this
all
you
have
to
say
if
i
were
to
say
all
the
words
in
the
language
said
nettie
after
a
pause
with
a
breathless
indistinctness
and
haste
words
will
not
change
if
we
should
break
our
hearts
the
open
door
with
the
light
shining
out
from
it
shone
upon
them
at
that
moment
and
mrs
smith
waiting
to
let
the
young
lady
in
neither
of
the
two
dared
face
that
sudden
gleam
the
doctor
laid
down
his
parcels
on
the
step
muttered
something
which
she
could
not
distinguish
into
nettie
agitated
ear
and
vanished
back
again
into
the
darkness
only
now
was
nettie
awaking
to
the
sense
of
what
had
happened
and
its
real
importance
perhaps
another
minute
another
word
might
have
made
a
difference
that
other
word
and
minute
that
are
always
wanting
she
gazed
out
after
him
blankly
scarcely
able
to
persuade
herself
that
it
was
all
over
and
then
went
in
with
a
kind
of
stupefied
stunned
sensation
not
to
be
described
edward
rider
heard
the
door
shut
in
the
calm
silence
and
swore
fierce
oaths
in
his
heart
over
her
composure
and
as
usual
it
was
the
woman
who
had
to
face
the
light
and
observation
and
to
veil
her
trouble
the
man
rushed
back
into
the
darkness
smarting
with
wounds
which
fell
as
severely
upon
his
pride
as
upon
his
heart
nettie
went
in
suddenly
conscious
that
the
world
was
changed
and
that
she
had
entered
upon
another
life
chapter
ix
another
life
and
a
changed
world
what
small
matters
sometimes
bring
about
that
sudden
disenchantment
two
or
three
words
exchanged
without
much
thought
one
figure
disappearing
out
of
the
landscape
and
lo
all
the
prismatic
colours
have
faded
from
the
horizon
and
blank
daylight
glares
upon
startled
eyes
nettie
had
not
up
to
this
time
entertained
a
suspicion
of
how
distinct
a
place
the
doctor
held
in
her
limited
firmament
she
was
totally
unaware
how
much
exhilaration
and
support
there
was
in
his
troubled
exasperated
impatient
admiration
now
all
at
once
she
found
it
out
it
was
the
same
life
yet
it
was
different
her
occupations
were
unchanged
her
surroundings
just
what
they
used
to
be
she
had
still
to
tolerate
fred
to
manage
susan
to
superintend
with
steady
economy
all
the
expenditure
of
the
strange
little
household
the
very
rooms
and
aspect
of
everything
was
the
same
yet
had
she
been
suddenly
transported
back
again
to
the
antipodes
life
could
not
have
been
more
completely
changed
to
nettie
she
recognised
it
at
once
with
some
surprise
but
without
any
struggle
the
fact
was
too
clearly
apparent
to
leave
her
in
any
doubt
nobody
but
herself
had
the
slightest
insight
into
the
great
event
which
had
happened
nobody
could
know
of
it
or
offer
nettie
any
sympathy
in
that
unforeseen
personal
trial
in
her
youth
and
buoyant
freshness
half
contemptuous
of
the
outside
troubles
which
were
no
match
for
her
indomitable
heart
nettie
had
been
fighting
against
hard
external
circumstances
for
a
great
part
of
her
valorous
little
life
and
had
not
hesitated
to
take
upon
herself
the
heaviest
burdens
of
outside
existence
such
struggles
are
not
hard
when
heart
is
light
and
sound
with
a
certain
splendid
youthful
scorn
of
all
these
labours
and
drudgeries
nettie
had
gone
on
her
triumphant
way
wearing
her
bonds
as
if
they
were
ornaments
suddenly
without
any
premonition
the
heart
had
died
out
of
her
existence
a
personal
blow
striking
with
subtle
force
into
that
unseen
centre
of
courage
and
hope
had
suddenly
disabled
nettie
she
said
not
a
word
on
the
subject
to
any
living
creature
if
she
shed
any
tears
over
it
they
were
dropped
in
the
darkness
and
left
no
witness
behind
but
she
silently
recognised
and
understood
what
had
happened
to
her
it
was
not
that
she
had
lost
her
lover
it
was
not
that
the
romance
of
youth
had
glimmered
and
disappeared
from
before
her
eyes
it
was
not
that
she
had
ever
entered
even
in
thought
as
edward
rider
had
done
into
that
life
glorified
out
of
common
existence
which
the
two
could
have
lived
together
such
was
not
the
form
which
this
extraordinary
loss
took
to
nettie
it
was
her
personal
happiness
wonderful
wine
of
life
which
had
suddenly
failed
to
the
brave
little
girl
ah
the
difference
it
made
labours
disgusts
endurances
of
all
kinds
what
can
not
one
undertake
so
long
as
one
has
that
cordial
at
one
heart
when
the
endurance
and
the
labour
remain
and
the
cordial
is
gone
it
is
a
changed
world
into
which
the
surprised
soul
enters
this
was
what
had
happened
to
nettie
nobody
suspected
the
sudden
change
which
had
passed
upon
everything
the
only
individual
in
the
world
who
could
have
divined
it
had
persuaded
himself
in
a
flush
of
anger
and
mortification
that
she
did
not
care
he
consoled
himself
by
elaborate
avoidance
of
that
road
which
led
past
st
roque
by
bows
of
elaborate
politeness
when
he
encountered
her
anywhere
in
the
streets
of
carlingford
by
taking
a
sudden
plunge
into
such
society
as
was
open
to
him
in
the
town
and
devoting
himself
to
miss
marjoribanks
the
old
physician
daughter
nettie
was
not
moved
by
these
demonstrations
which
showed
her
sway
still
undiminished
over
the
doctor
angry
and
jealous
heart
she
did
not
regard
the
petulant
shows
of
pretended
indifference
by
which
a
more
experienced
young
woman
might
have
consoled
herself
she
had
enough
to
do
now
that
the
unsuspected
stimulus
of
her
life
was
withdrawn
for
the
moment
to
go
on
steadily
without
making
any
outward
show
of
it
she
had
come
to
the
first
real
trial
of
her
strength
and
worthiness
and
nettie
did
not
know
what
a
piece
of
heroism
she
was
enacting
nor
that
the
hardest
lesson
of
youthful
life
how
to
go
on
stoutly
without
the
happiness
which
that
absolute
essence
of
existence
demands
and
will
not
be
refused
was
being
taught
her
now
she
only
knew
it
was
dull
work
just
for
the
moment
a
tedious
sort
of
routine
which
one
was
glad
to
think
could
not
last
for
ever
and
so
went
on
the
steadfast
little
soul
no
one
being
any
the
wiser
upon
that
laborious
way
it
is
sad
to
be
obliged
to
confess
that
dr
rider
conduct
was
nothing
like
so
heroical
he
injured
and
indignant
and
angry
thought
first
of
all
of
revenging
himself
upon
nettie
of
proving
to
her
that
he
would
get
over
it
and
that
there
were
women
in
the
world
more
reasonable
than
herself
dr
marjoribanks
who
had
already
made
those
advances
to
the
doctor
which
that
poor
young
fellow
had
gone
to
carry
the
news
of
not
without
elation
of
heart
on
that
memorable
night
to
st
roque
asked
edward
to
dinner
a
few
days
after
and
miss
marjoribanks
made
herself
very
agreeable
with
just
that
degree
of
delicate
regard
and
evident
pleasure
in
his
society
which
is
so
soothing
when
one
has
met
with
a
recent
discomfiture
miss
marjoribanks
it
is
true
was
over
thirty
and
by
no
means
a
titania
edward
rider
who
had
retired
from
the
field
in
bessie
christian
case
and
whom
nettie
had
rejected
asked
himself
savagely
why
he
should
not
make
an
advantageous
marriage
now
when
the
chance
offered
old
marjoribanks
practice
and
savings
with
a
not
unagreeable
rather
clever
wife
why
should
he
not
take
it
into
consideration
the
young
doctor
thought
of
that
possibility
with
a
certain
thrill
of
cruel
pleasure
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
make
his
fortune
and
be
revenged
on
nettie
whenever
there
was
a
chance
of
nettie
hearing
of
it
he
paid
the
most
devoted
attentions
to
miss
marjoribanks
ready
gossips
took
it
up
and
made
the
matter
public
everybody
agreed
it
would
be
an
admirable
arrangement
the
most
sensible
thing
i
heard
of
for
years
step
into
the
old
fellow
practice
and
set
himself
up
for
life
eh
do
you
think
so
that
my
opinion
said
mr
wodehouse
mr
wodehouse
daughters
talked
over
the
matter
and
settled
exactly
between
themselves
what
was
miss
marjoribanks
age
and
how
much
older
she
was
than
her
supposed
suitor
a
question
always
interesting
to
the
female
mind
and
it
was
natural
that
in
these
circumstances
nettie
should
come
to
hear
of
it
all
in
its
full
details
with
the
various
comments
naturally
suggesting
themselves
thereupon
what
nettie
opinion
was
however
nobody
could
ever
gather
perhaps
she
thought
dr
edward
was
justified
in
putting
an
immediate
barrier
between
himself
and
her
at
all
events
she
was
perfectly
clear
upon
the
point
that
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
and
that
no
other
decision
was
possible
to
herself
the
spring
lagged
on
accordingly
under
these
circumstances
those
commonplace
unalterable
days
varied
in
nothing
but
the
natural
fluctuations
of
making
and
mending
those
evenings
with
fred
sulky
by
the
fire
always
sulky
because
deprived
by
nettie
presence
of
his
usual
indulgences
or
if
not
so
then
enjoying
himself
after
his
dismal
fashion
in
his
own
room
with
most
likely
susan
bearing
him
company
and
the
little
maiden
head
of
the
house
left
all
by
herself
in
the
solitary
parlour
passed
on
one
by
one
each
more
tedious
than
the
other
it
seemed
impossible
that
such
heavy
hours
could
last
and
prolong
themselves
into
infinitude
as
they
did
but
still
one
succeeded
another
in
endless
hard
procession
and
nettie
shed
back
her
silky
load
of
hair
and
pressed
her
tiny
fingers
on
her
eyes
and
went
on
again
always
dauntless
she
said
to
herself
with
homely
philosophy
that
this
could
not
last
very
long
not
with
any
tragical
meaning
but
with
a
recognition
of
the
ordinary
laws
of
nature
which
young
ladies
under
the
pressure
of
a
first
disappointment
are
not
apt
to
recur
to
she
tried
indeed
to
calculate
in
herself
with
forlorn
heroism
how
long
it
might
be
expected
to
last
and
though
she
could
not
fix
the
period
endeavoured
to
content
herself
with
the
thought
that
things
must
eventually
fall
into
their
natural
condition
in
the
mean
time
it
was
slow
and
tedious
work
enough
but
they
did
pass
one
after
another
these
inevitable
days
one
night
nettie
was
sitting
by
herself
in
the
parlour
busy
over
her
needlework
fred
and
his
wife
she
thought
were
they
had
left
her
early
in
the
evening
susan
to
lie
down
being
tired
fred
to
his
ordinary
amusements
it
was
a
matter
of
course
and
cost
nettie
no
special
thought
after
the
children
went
to
bed
she
sat
all
by
herself
with
her
thread
and
scissors
on
the
table
working
on
steadily
and
quietly
at
the
little
garment
she
was
making
her
needle
flew
swift
and
nimbly
the
sleeve
of
her
dress
rustled
as
she
moved
her
arm
her
soft
breath
went
and
came
but
for
that
regular
monotonous
movement
and
those
faint
steady
sounds
of
life
it
might
have
been
a
picture
of
domestic
tranquillity
and
quiet
and
not
a
living
woman
with
aches
in
her
heart
it
did
not
matter
what
she
was
thinking
she
was
facing
life
and
fortune
indomitable
not
to
be
discouraged
in
the
silence
of
the
house
she
sat
late
over
her
needlework
anxious
to
have
some
special
task
finished
she
heard
the
mistress
of
the
cottage
locking
up
but
took
no
notice
of
that
performance
and
went
on
at
her
work
forgetting
time
it
got
to
be
very
silent
in
the
house
and
without
not
a
sound
in
the
rooms
where
everybody
was
asleep
not
a
sound
outside
except
an
occasional
rustle
of
the
night
wind
through
the
bare
deep
night
and
not
a
creature
awake
but
herself
sitting
in
the
heart
of
that
intense
and
throbbing
silence
somehow
there
was
a
kind
of
pleasure
to
nettie
in
the
isolation
which
was
so
impossible
to
her
at
other
hours
she
sat
rapt
in
that
laborious
quiet
as
if
her
busy
fingers
were
under
some
spell
when
suddenly
she
heard
a
startled
motion
as
if
some
one
had
got
up
hastily
then
a
rustling
about
the
room
overhead
which
was
susan
room
after
a
while
during
which
nettie
restored
by
the
sound
to
all
her
growing
cares
rose
instantly
to
consideration
of
the
question
what
had
happened
now
the
door
above
was
stealthily
opened
and
a
footstep
came
softly
down
the
stair
nettie
put
down
her
work
and
listened
breathlessly
presently
susan
head
peeped
in
at
the
parlour
door
after
all
then
it
was
only
some
restlessness
of
susan
nettie
took
up
her
work
impatient
perhaps
almost
disappointed
with
the
dead
calm
in
which
nothing
ever
happened
susan
came
in
stealthy
pale
trembling
with
cold
and
fright
she
came
forward
to
the
table
in
her
white
like
a
faded
ghost
fred
has
never
come
in
said
susan
in
a
shivering
whisper
is
it
very
late
he
promised
he
would
only
be
gone
an
hour
where
he
have
gone
nettie
nettie
sit
so
quiet
and
stare
at
me
i
fell
asleep
or
i
should
have
found
it
out
sooner
all
the
house
is
locked
up
and
he
has
never
come
in
if
he
comes
we
can
unlock
the
house
said
nettie
when
did
he
go
out
and
why
did
you
tell
me
of
course
i
should
have
let
mrs
smith
know
not
to
frighten
her
but
i
told
fred
pretty
plainly
last
time
that
we
could
not
do
with
such
hours
it
will
make
him
ill
if
he
does
not
mind
go
to
bed
and
i
let
him
in
go
to
bed
it
is
very
easy
for
you
to
say
so
do
you
know
it
the
middle
of
the
night
and
as
dark
as
pitch
and
my
husband
out
all
by
himself
cried
susan
oh
fred
fred
after
all
the
promises
you
made
to
use
me
like
this
again
do
you
think
i
can
go
and
lie
shivering
in
the
dark
and
imagining
all
sorts
of
dreadful
things
happening
to
him
i
shall
stay
here
with
you
till
he
comes
in
nettie
entered
into
no
controversy
she
got
up
quietly
and
fetched
a
shawl
and
put
it
round
her
shivering
sister
then
sat
down
again
and
took
up
her
needlework
but
susan
excited
nerves
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
that
occupation
the
rustle
of
nettie
hand
distracted
her
it
sounds
always
like
fred
step
on
the
way
said
the
fretful
anxious
woman
oh
nettie
nettie
do
open
the
end
window
and
look
out
perhaps
he
is
looking
for
the
light
in
the
windows
to
guide
him
straight
it
is
so
dark
open
the
shutters
nettie
and
oh
do
look
out
and
see
where
do
you
suppose
he
can
have
gone
to
i
feel
such
a
pang
at
my
heart
i
believe
i
shall
die
oh
no
you
will
not
die
said
nettie
take
a
book
and
read
or
do
something
we
know
what
is
about
the
worst
that
will
happen
to
fred
he
will
come
home
you
know
as
he
did
before
we
ca
mend
it
but
we
need
not
break
our
hearts
over
it
lie
down
on
the
sofa
and
put
up
your
feet
and
wrap
the
shawl
round
you
if
you
wo
go
to
bed
i
can
fancy
all
very
well
how
it
will
be
it
is
nothing
new
susan
that
you
should
break
your
heart
it
you
that
have
no
feeling
oh
nettie
how
hard
you
are
i
believe
you
know
what
it
is
to
love
anybody
said
susan
hark
is
that
some
one
coming
now
they
thought
some
one
was
coming
fifty
times
in
the
course
of
that
dreadful
lingering
night
nobody
came
the
silence
closed
in
deeper
and
deeper
around
the
two
silent
women
all
the
world
everything
round
about
them
to
the
veriest
atom
seemed
asleep
the
cricket
had
stopped
his
chirrup
in
the
kitchen
and
no
mouse
stirred
in
the
slumbering
house
by
times
susan
dozed
on
the
sofa
shivering
notwithstanding
her
shawl
and
nettie
took
up
her
needlework
for
the
moment
to
distract
her
thoughts
when
susan
started
from
these
snatches
of
slumber
she
importuned
her
sister
with
ceaseless
questions
and
entreaties
where
had
he
gone
where
did
nettie
imagine
he
could
have
gone
and
oh
would
she
go
to
the
window
and
look
out
to
see
if
any
one
was
coming
or
put
the
candle
to
the
window
to
guide
him
if
perhaps
he
might
have
lost
the
way
at
last
the
terrible
pale
dawn
came
in
and
took
the
light
out
of
nettie
candle
the
two
looked
at
each
other
and
acknowledged
with
a
mutual
start
that
the
night
was
over
they
had
watched
these
long
hours
through
with
sentiments
very
different
now
a
certain
thrill
of
sympathy
drew
nettie
nearer
to
her
sister
it
was
daylight
again
remorseless
and
uncompromising
and
where
was
fred
who
loved
the
darkness
he
had
little
money
and
less
credit
in
the
limited
place
where
himself
and
his
story
were
known
what
could
have
become
of
him
nettie
acknowledged
that
there
was
ground
for
anxiety
she
folded
up
her
work
and
put
out
her
candle
and
promptly
took
into
consideration
what
she
could
do
if
you
will
go
to
bed
susan
i
shall
go
out
and
look
for
him
said
nettie
he
might
have
stumbled
in
the
field
and
fallen
asleep
men
have
done
such
things
before
now
and
been
none
the
worse
for
it
if
you
will
go
and
lie
down
i
see
after
it
susan
now
it
daylight
you
know
no
great
harm
can
happen
to
him
come
and
lie
down
and
leave
me
to
look
for
fred
but
you
do
know
where
to
go
and
he
wo
like
to
have
you
going
after
him
nettie
send
to
edward
said
susan
he
ought
to
come
and
look
after
his
brother
he
ought
to
have
done
it
all
through
and
not
to
have
left
us
to
manage
everything
and
he
has
even
been
to
see
us
for
ever
so
long
but
send
to
edward
nettie
it
his
business
for
fred
wo
like
to
have
you
going
after
him
and
you
do
know
where
to
go
fred
must
have
me
going
after
him
whether
he
likes
it
or
no
said
nettie
sharply
and
i
shall
not
send
to
dr
edward
you
choose
to
insult
him
whenever
you
can
and
then
you
think
it
is
his
business
to
look
after
his
brother
go
to
bed
and
leave
it
to
me
i
ca
leave
you
shivering
here
to
catch
something
and
be
ill
and
laid
up
for
weeks
i
want
to
get
my
bonnet
on
and
to
see
you
in
bed
make
haste
and
come
with
me
susan
obeyed
with
some
mutterings
of
inarticulate
discontent
the
daylight
after
the
first
shock
of
finding
that
the
night
was
really
over
brought
some
comfort
to
her
foolish
heart
she
thought
that
as
nettie
said
no
more
harm
could
come
to
him
he
must
be
sleeping
somewhere
the
foolish
fellow
she
thought
most
likely
nettie
was
right
and
that
she
had
best
go
to
bed
to
consume
the
weary
time
till
there
could
be
something
heard
of
him
and
nettie
of
course
would
find
it
all
out
such
was
the
arrangement
accordingly
susan
covered
herself
up
warm
and
lay
thinking
all
she
should
say
to
him
when
he
came
home
and
how
she
certainly
never
would
again
let
him
go
out
and
keep
it
secret
from
nettie
nettie
for
her
part
bathed
her
hot
eyes
put
on
her
bonnet
and
went
out
quietly
undoing
all
the
bolts
and
bars
into
the
chill
morning
world
where
nobody
was
yet
awake
she
was
a
little
uncertain
which
way
to
turn
but
noway
uncertain
of
her
business
whether
he
had
gone
into
the
town
or
towards
the
low
quarter
by
the
banks
of
the
canal
she
felt
it
difficult
to
conclude
but
remembering
her
own
suggestion
that
he
might
have
stumbled
in
the
field
and
fallen
asleep
there
she
took
her
way
across
the
misty
grass
it
was
still
spring
and
a
little
crisped
the
wintry
sod
everything
lay
forlorn
and
chill
under
the
leaden
morning
skies
not
even
an
early
disturbed
the
echoes
when
the
cock
crew
somewhere
it
startled
nettie
she
went
like
a
spectre
across
the
misty
fields
looking
down
into
the
ditches
and
all
the
inequalities
of
the
way
on
the
other
side
lay
the
canal
not
visible
except
by
the
line
of
road
that
wound
beside
it
from
the
dead
flat
around
she
bent
her
steps
in
that
direction
thinking
of
a
certain
mean
little
tavern
which
somehow
when
she
saw
it
she
had
associated
with
fred
a
place
where
the
men
at
the
door
looked
slovenly
and
heated
like
fred
himself
and
lounged
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
at
noon
of
some
instinct
guided
nettie
there
but
she
had
no
need
to
go
so
far
before
she
reached
that
place
the
first
sounds
of
life
that
she
had
yet
heard
attracted
attention
they
came
from
a
boat
which
lay
in
the
canal
in
which
the
bargemen
seemed
preparing
to
start
on
their
day
journey
some
men
were
leisurely
leading
forward
the
horses
to
the
while
two
in
the
boat
were
preparing
for
their
start
inside
all
at
once
a
strange
cry
rang
into
the
still
chill
air
such
a
cry
as
startles
all
who
can
hear
it
the
men
with
the
horses
hurried
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
canal
the
bargemen
hung
over
the
side
of
their
boat
visible
excitement
rose
among
them
about
something
there
nettie
never
afraid
was
less
timid
than
ever
this
morning
without
thinking
of
the
risk
of
trusting
herself
with
these
rude
fellows
alone
she
went
straight
forward
into
the
midst
of
them
with
a
curiosity
for
which
she
could
scarcely
account
not
anxiety
only
a
certain
wonder
and
impatience
possessed
her
to
see
what
they
had
here
what
had
they
there
not
a
man
a
dreadful
drowned
image
all
soiled
and
swollen
a
squalid
tragic
form
immovable
never
to
move
more
nettie
did
not
need
to
look
at
the
dread
uncovered
upturned
face
the
moment
she
saw
the
vague
shape
of
it
rising
against
the
side
of
the
boat
a
heap
of
dead
limbs
recognisable
only
as
something
human
the
terrible
truth
flashed
upon
nettie
she
had
found
not
him
but
it
she
saw
nothing
more
for
one
awful
moment
heaven
and
earth
reeling
and
circling
around
her
and
a
horror
of
darkness
on
her
eyes
then
the
cold
light
opened
up
again
the
group
of
living
creatures
against
the
colourless
skies
the
dead
creature
staring
and
ghastly
with
awful
dead
eyes
gazing
blank
into
the
shuddering
day
the
girl
steadied
herself
as
she
could
on
the
brink
of
the
sluggish
current
and
collected
her
thoughts
the
conclusion
to
her
search
and
answer
to
all
her
questions
lay
not
to
be
doubted
or
questioned
before
her
she
dared
not
yield
to
her
own
horror
or
grief
or
dismay
susan
sleeping
unsuspicious
in
full
trust
of
his
return
the
slumbering
house
into
which
this
dreadful
figure
must
be
carried
obliterated
all
personal
impressions
from
nettie
mind
she
explained
to
the
amazed
group
who
and
what
the
dead
man
was
where
he
must
be
brought
to
instantly
silently
before
the
world
was
awake
she
watched
them
lay
the
heavy
form
upon
a
board
and
took
off
her
own
shawl
to
lay
over
it
to
conceal
it
from
the
face
of
day
then
she
went
on
before
them
with
her
tiny
figure
in
its
girlish
dress
like
a
child
in
the
shadow
of
the
rough
but
pitying
group
that
followed
nettie
did
not
know
why
the
wind
went
so
chill
to
her
heart
after
she
had
taken
off
her
shawl
she
did
not
see
the
unequal
sod
under
her
feet
as
she
went
back
upon
that
dread
and
solemn
road
nothing
in
the
world
but
what
she
had
to
do
occupied
the
throbbing
heroic
heart
there
was
nobody
else
to
do
it
how
could
the
girl
help
but
execute
the
work
put
into
her
hand
thinking
neither
of
the
hardship
nor
the
horror
of
such
dread
work
falling
to
her
lot
but
only
this
that
she
must
do
it
nettie
took
home
to
the
unconscious
sleeping
cottage
that
thing
which
was
fred
rider
no
heavier
on
his
bearers
hands
than
he
had
been
already
for
years
of
his
wasted
life
chapter
x
when
nettie
opened
the
door
of
the
sleeping
house
with
the
great
key
she
had
carried
with
her
in
her
early
dreadful
expedition
there
was
still
nobody
stirring
in
the
unconscious
cottage
she
paused
at
the
door
with
the
four
men
behind
her
carrying
that
terrible
motionless
burden
where
was
she
to
lay
it
in
her
own
room
where
she
had
not
slept
that
night
little
freddy
was
still
sleeping
in
another
was
the
widow
overcome
by
watching
and
fretful
anxiety
the
other
fatherless
creatures
lay
in
the
little
nowhere
but
in
the
parlour
from
which
fred
not
so
very
long
ago
had
driven
his
disgusted
brother
the
only
place
she
had
where
nettie
own
feminine
niceties
could
find
expression
and
where
the
accessories
of
her
own
daily
life
and
work
were
all
accumulated
she
lingered
even
at
that
dread
moment
with
a
pang
of
natural
reluctance
to
associate
that
little
sanctuary
with
the
horror
and
misery
of
this
but
when
every
feeling
gave
way
to
the
pressure
of
necessity
that
superficial
one
was
not
like
to
resist
it
her
companions
were
not
aware
that
she
had
hesitated
even
for
that
moment
she
seemed
to
them
to
glide
softly
steadfastly
without
any
faltering
before
them
into
the
little
silent
womanly
room
where
her
night
work
was
folded
tidily
upon
the
table
and
her
tiny
thimble
and
scissors
laid
beside
it
what
a
contrast
lay
between
those
domestic
traces
and
that
dreadful
muffled
figure
covered
from
the
light
of
day
with
nettie
shawl
which
was
now
laid
down
there
nettie
did
not
pause
to
think
of
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
gazing
at
it
with
a
sob
of
excitement
and
agitation
swelling
into
her
throat
scarcely
grief
perhaps
that
was
not
possible
but
the
intensest
remorseful
pity
over
the
lost
life
the
rude
fellows
beside
her
stood
silent
not
without
a
certain
pang
of
tenderness
and
sympathy
in
their
hearts
she
took
her
little
purse
out
and
emptied
it
of
its
few
silver
coins
among
them
they
trod
softly
but
their
heavy
footsteps
were
heard
notwithstanding
through
all
the
little
house
nettie
could
already
hear
the
alarmed
stirring
of
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
cottage
and
knowing
what
explanations
she
must
give
and
all
the
dreadful
business
before
her
made
haste
to
get
her
strange
companions
away
before
mrs
smith
came
one
of
them
however
as
he
followed
his
comrades
out
of
the
room
from
some
confused
instinct
of
help
and
pity
asked
whether
he
should
not
fetch
a
doctor
the
question
struck
the
resolute
little
girl
with
a
pang
sharper
than
this
horror
had
yet
given
her
had
she
perhaps
neglected
the
first
duty
of
all
the
possibility
of
restoration
she
went
back
without
answering
him
to
lift
the
shawl
from
that
dreadful
face
and
satisfy
herself
whether
she
had
done
that
last
irremediable
wrong
to
fred
as
she
met
the
dreadful
stare
of
those
dead
eyes
all
the
revulsion
of
feeling
which
comes
to
the
hearts
of
the
living
in
presence
of
the
dead
overpowered
nettie
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
inarticulate
momentary
anguish
the
soul
of
that
confused
and
tremulous
outcry
was
pardon
pardon
what
love
was
ever
so
true
what
tenderness
so
constant
and
unfailing
that
did
not
instinctively
utter
that
cry
when
the
watched
life
had
ended
and
pardon
could
no
longer
come
from
those
sealed
lips
nettie
had
not
loved
that
shamed
and
ruined
man
she
had
done
him
the
offices
of
affection
and
endured
and
sometimes
scorned
him
she
stood
remorseful
by
his
side
in
that
first
dread
hour
which
had
changed
fred
shabby
presence
into
something
awful
and
her
generous
soul
burst
forth
in
that
cry
of
penitence
which
every
human
creature
owes
its
brother
the
bargeman
who
had
asked
leave
to
fetch
a
doctor
drew
near
her
with
a
kindred
instinct
do
take
on
miss
there
the
crowner
yet
and
a
deal
to
look
to
said
the
kind
rough
fellow
who
knew
nettie
the
words
recalled
her
to
herself
but
with
the
softened
feelings
of
the
moment
a
certain
longing
for
somebody
to
stand
by
her
in
this
extremity
came
over
the
forlorn
courageous
creature
who
never
yet
amid
all
her
labours
had
encountered
an
emergency
like
this
she
laid
the
shawl
reverently
back
over
that
dead
face
and
sent
a
message
to
the
doctor
with
lips
that
trembled
in
spite
of
herself
tell
him
what
has
happened
and
say
he
is
to
come
as
soon
as
he
can
said
nettie
for
i
do
not
understand
all
that
has
to
be
done
tell
him
i
sent
you
and
now
go
please
go
before
they
all
come
but
when
nettie
turned
in
again
after
closing
the
door
into
that
house
so
entirely
changed
in
character
by
the
solemn
inmate
who
had
entered
it
she
was
confronted
by
the
amazed
and
troubled
apparition
of
mrs
smith
and
full
of
wonder
and
indignation
a
gasping
exclamation
of
miss
was
all
that
good
woman
could
utter
she
had
with
her
own
eyes
perceived
some
of
the
roughs
of
carlingford
emerging
from
her
respectable
door
under
nettie
grave
supervision
and
yet
could
not
in
her
heart
notwithstanding
appearances
think
any
harm
of
nettie
while
at
the
same
time
a
hundred
alarms
for
the
safety
of
her
household
gods
shook
her
soul
nettie
turned
towards
her
steadily
with
her
face
pallid
and
her
brilliant
eyes
heavy
hush
she
said
susan
knows
nothing
yet
let
her
have
her
rest
while
she
can
we
have
been
watching
for
him
all
night
and
poor
susan
is
sleeping
and
does
not
know
know
what
what
has
happened
he
been
and
killed
himself
oh
miss
do
you
go
for
to
say
so
cried
mrs
smith
in
natural
dismay
and
terror
no
cried
nettie
with
a
long
sigh
that
relieved
her
breast
not
so
bad
as
that
thank
heaven
but
hush
hush
i
can
not
go
and
tell
susan
just
yet
not
just
yet
oh
give
me
a
moment
to
get
breath
for
he
is
dead
i
tell
you
cried
nettie
seizing
the
woman
hand
and
wringing
it
in
the
extremity
of
her
terror
for
alarming
susan
you
understand
me
she
is
a
widow
and
she
does
not
know
her
husband
is
dead
and
she
does
not
know
have
you
no
pity
for
her
in
your
own
heart
lord
ha
mercy
but
wait
till
i
call
smith
cried
the
alarmed
landlady
shrinking
yet
eager
to
know
the
horribly
interesting
details
of
that
tragedy
she
ran
breathless
on
that
errand
while
nettie
went
back
to
the
door
of
the
parlour
resolutely
locked
it
and
took
away
the
key
nobody
shall
go
gazing
and
talking
over
him
and
making
a
wonder
of
poor
fred
said
nettie
to
herself
shaking
off
from
her
long
eyelashes
the
tear
which
came
out
of
the
compunction
of
her
heart
poor
fred
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
chairs
of
the
little
hall
beside
that
closed
door
the
children
and
their
mother
still
slept
unsuspicious
and
their
young
guardian
with
a
world
of
thoughts
rising
in
her
mind
sat
still
and
pondered
the
past
was
suddenly
cut
off
from
the
future
by
this
dreadful
event
she
had
come
to
a
dead
pause
in
that
life
which
to
every
spectator
was
so
strangely
out
of
accordance
with
her
youth
but
which
was
to
herself
such
simple
and
plain
necessity
as
to
permit
no
questioning
she
was
brought
suddenly
to
a
standstill
at
this
terrible
moment
and
sat
turning
her
dauntless
little
face
to
the
new
trial
before
her
pale
but
undismayed
nettie
did
not
deceive
herself
even
in
her
thoughts
she
saw
with
the
intuitive
foresight
of
a
keen
observer
her
sister
violent
momentary
grief
her
indolent
acceptance
of
the
position
after
a
while
the
selfish
reserve
of
repining
and
discontent
which
susan
would
establish
in
the
memory
of
poor
fred
she
saw
how
with
fuller
certainty
than
ever
because
now
more
naturally
she
herself
her
mind
her
laborious
hands
her
little
fortune
would
belong
to
the
fatherless
family
she
did
not
sigh
over
the
prospect
or
falter
but
she
exercised
no
on
the
subject
there
was
nobody
but
she
to
do
it
nobody
but
she
in
her
tender
maidenhood
to
manage
all
the
vulgar
tragical
business
which
must
this
very
day
confirm
to
the
knowledge
of
the
little
surrounding
world
the
event
which
had
happened
nobody
but
herself
to
tell
the
tale
to
the
widow
to
bear
all
the
burdens
of
the
time
nettie
did
not
think
over
these
particulars
with
or
wonder
over
her
hard
lot
she
did
not
imagine
herself
to
have
chosen
this
lot
at
all
there
was
nobody
else
to
do
it
that
was
the
simple
secret
of
her
strength
but
this
interval
of
forlorn
repose
was
a
very
brief
one
smith
came
down
putting
on
his
coat
and
looking
scared
and
bewildered
his
wife
eager
curious
and
excited
closely
following
nettie
rose
when
they
approached
her
to
forestall
their
questions
my
is
dead
she
said
he
fell
into
the
canal
last
night
and
was
drowned
i
went
out
to
look
for
him
and
and
found
him
poor
fellow
oh
do
cry
out
or
make
a
noise
remember
susan
does
not
know
now
dear
mrs
smith
i
know
you
are
kind
i
know
you
will
not
vex
me
just
at
this
moment
i
have
had
him
laid
till
his
brother
comes
oh
do
say
it
dreadful
do
you
think
i
can
not
see
how
dreadful
it
is
but
we
must
not
think
about
that
only
what
has
to
be
done
when
dr
edward
comes
i
will
wake
my
sister
but
just
for
this
moment
oh
have
patience
i
had
no
place
to
put
him
except
but
lord
bless
us
he
might
be
clean
gone
he
might
be
recovered
poor
gentleman
smith
can
run
for
dr
marjoribanks
he
is
nearer
nor
dr
rider
cried
the
curious
excited
landlady
with
her
hand
upon
the
locked
door
nettie
made
no
answer
she
took
them
into
the
room
in
solemn
silence
and
showed
them
the
stark
and
ghastly
figure
for
which
all
possibilities
had
been
over
in
the
dark
midnight
waters
hours
ago
the
earliest
gleam
of
sunshine
came
shining
in
at
that
moment
through
the
window
which
last
night
nettie
had
opened
that
fred
might
see
the
light
in
it
and
be
guided
home
it
seemed
to
strike
like
a
reproach
upon
that
impatient
heart
which
felt
as
a
sin
against
the
dead
its
own
lack
of
natural
grief
and
affection
she
went
hurriedly
to
draw
down
the
blinds
and
close
out
the
unwelcome
light
now
he
is
gone
nobody
shall
slight
or
scorn
him
said
nettie
to
herself
with
hot
tears
and
she
turned
the
wondering
dismayed
couple
already
awakening
out
of
their
first
horror
to
think
of
the
injury
done
to
their
house
and
lodgings
and
all
the
notoriety
of
an
inquest
out
of
the
room
and
locked
the
door
upon
the
unwilling
owners
whom
nothing
but
her
resolute
face
prevented
from
bursting
forth
in
selfish
but
natural
lamentations
over
their
own
secondary
share
in
so
disastrous
an
event
nettie
sat
down
again
a
silent
little
sentinel
by
the
closed
door
without
her
shawl
and
with
her
tiny
chilled
feet
on
the
cold
tiles
nettie
sat
silent
too
much
occupied
even
to
ascertain
the
causes
of
her
personal
discomfort
she
had
indeed
enough
to
think
of
and
while
her
little
girlish
figure
so
dainty
so
light
so
unlike
her
fortunes
remained
in
that
unusual
stillness
her
mind
and
heart
were
palpitating
with
thoughts
all
kinds
of
thoughts
not
only
considerations
worthy
the
solemnity
and
horror
of
the
moment
but
every
kind
of
trivial
and
secondary
necessity
passed
through
that
restless
soul
all
throbbing
with
life
and
action
more
than
usual
from
the
fact
of
its
outward
stillness
a
hundred
rapid
conclusions
and
calculations
about
the
funeral
the
mourning
the
change
of
domestic
habits
involved
darted
through
nettie
mind
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
leap
forward
into
these
the
immediate
necessity
before
her
the
dreadful
errand
on
which
she
must
presently
go
to
her
sister
bedside
the
burst
of
wailing
and
reproachful
grief
which
all
alone
nettie
would
have
to
encounter
and
subdue
were
not
to
be
thought
of
she
bent
down
her
little
head
into
her
hands
and
once
more
shed
back
that
hair
which
never
relieved
out
of
its
braids
through
all
this
long
night
began
to
droop
over
her
pale
cheeks
and
a
quick
sigh
of
impatience
of
energy
restrained
of
such
powerlessness
as
her
courageous
capable
soul
in
the
very
excess
of
its
courage
and
capacity
felt
in
its
approaching
conflict
with
the
feeble
foolish
creature
who
never
could
be
stimulated
out
of
her
own
narrow
possibilities
burst
from
nettie
breast
but
the
sigh
was
as
much
physical
as
mental
the
breath
of
mingled
weariness
and
restlessness
the
instinct
to
be
doing
and
the
exhaustion
of
long
labour
and
emotion
blended
together
thus
she
waited
while
the
cold
spring
morning
brightened
and
mrs
smith
went
about
her
early
domestic
business
returning
often
into
the
little
with
the
mullioned
window
of
which
domestic
gothic
treatment
had
made
a
condemned
cell
to
her
anxieties
and
horrors
nettie
had
an
instinctive
consciousness
even
of
mrs
smith
grievance
she
knew
this
dismal
association
would
ruin
the
lodgings
and
felt
that
here
was
another
bond
upon
her
to
remain
at
st
roque
however
much
she
might
long
to
escape
and
flee
away
all
these
crowding
and
breathless
thoughts
were
a
few
minutes
after
reduced
to
absolute
momentary
stillness
it
was
by
a
step
outside
coming
hastily
with
rapid
purpose
along
the
silent
way
nettie
rose
up
to
meet
edward
rider
not
as
the
angry
lover
still
fiercely
resentful
of
that
rejection
which
was
no
rejection
but
only
a
bare
and
simple
statement
of
necessity
not
as
the
suitor
of
miss
marjoribanks
simply
as
the
only
creature
in
the
world
who
could
help
her
or
to
whom
she
would
delegate
any
portion
of
her
own
hard
but
inevitable
work
she
opened
the
door
before
he
had
time
to
knock
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
silently
quite
unawares
betraying
her
recognition
of
his
step
her
comfort
in
his
presence
that
meeting
flushed
the
doctor
anxious
face
with
a
mingled
shame
and
triumph
not
expressible
in
words
but
left
nettie
as
pale
as
preoccupied
as
much
absorbed
in
her
thoughts
and
duties
as
before
dr
edward
i
should
not
have
sent
for
you
if
i
could
have
done
it
all
myself
said
nettie
but
i
knew
you
would
think
it
right
to
be
here
now
and
i
have
susan
and
the
children
to
look
to
i
commit
this
to
you
do
they
know
said
the
doctor
taking
the
key
she
gave
him
and
holding
fast
with
an
instinct
of
compassion
almost
more
strong
than
love
the
little
hand
which
never
trembled
i
will
tell
susan
now
that
you
have
come
i
could
not
before
said
nettie
with
another
sigh
poor
susan
i
was
glad
to
let
her
sleep
but
there
is
no
one
to
think
whether
you
sleep
or
not
cried
edward
rider
and
those
eyes
have
watched
all
night
nettie
nettie
could
not
you
have
sent
for
me
sooner
a
word
would
have
brought
me
at
any
moment
you
were
not
wanted
till
now
said
nettie
not
without
a
touch
of
womanly
pride
i
have
always
been
able
to
do
my
own
work
dr
edward
but
now
do
let
us
quarrel
any
more
she
said
after
a
pause
you
were
angry
once
and
i
do
wonder
never
mind
all
that
but
let
us
be
friends
and
do
let
all
the
people
and
strangers
and
men
who
belong
to
us
cried
nettie
once
more
with
hot
tears
in
her
eyes
be
hard
upon
poor
fred
the
next
moment
she
had
vanished
and
left
the
doctor
alone
standing
in
the
little
cold
hall
with
the
key
in
his
hand
and
mrs
smith
troubled
countenance
beholding
him
from
far
edward
rider
paused
before
he
entered
upon
his
dismal
share
of
this
morning
work
death
itself
did
not
suffice
to
endear
fred
rider
to
his
brother
but
he
stood
still
with
a
certain
to
withdraw
his
thoughts
if
he
could
from
nettie
and
to
subdue
the
thrill
the
most
living
touch
of
life
which
this
meeting
had
stirred
within
him
before
he
entered
that
miserable
chamber
of
death
chapter
xi
that
dreadful
day
ebbed
over
slowly
tedious
yet
so
full
of
events
and
dismal
business
that
it
looked
like
a
year
rather
than
a
day
the
necessary
investigations
were
got
through
without
any
special
call
upon
nettie
she
spent
the
most
of
the
day
with
susan
whose
wild
refusal
to
believe
at
first
and
sullen
stupor
afterwards
were
little
different
from
the
picture
which
nettie
imagination
had
already
made
the
children
received
the
news
with
wondering
stares
and
questions
that
they
did
not
understand
it
was
little
but
that
they
scarcely
were
interested
after
the
first
movement
of
curiosity
disappointed
and
wounded
the
impatient
heart
which
unconsciously
chafed
at
its
own
total
inability
to
convey
the
feelings
natural
to
such
a
terrible
occasion
into
any
bosom
but
its
own
nettie
perpetual
activity
had
hitherto
saved
her
from
this
disgust
and
disappointment
she
had
been
bitterly
intolerant
by
moments
of
fred
disgraceful
content
and
satisfaction
with
his
own
indulgences
but
had
never
paused
to
fret
over
what
she
could
not
help
nor
contrast
her
own
high
youthful
humour
and
sense
of
duty
with
the
dull
insensibility
around
her
but
had
rapt
the
heroic
little
girl
into
a
different
atmosphere
from
that
she
had
been
breathing
hitherto
she
was
aware
that
her
work
had
been
so
far
taken
out
of
her
hands
and
acknowledged
in
her
heart
that
it
was
best
it
should
be
so
she
heard
the
heavy
feet
of
men
coming
and
going
but
was
not
obliged
to
descend
into
immediate
conflict
with
all
the
circumstances
of
so
horrible
a
crisis
it
was
a
new
sensation
to
nettie
a
year
ago
perhaps
she
would
not
have
relinquished
even
that
dreadful
business
to
any
one
the
thought
of
having
some
one
else
who
did
it
for
her
and
took
comfort
in
relieving
her
burdened
hands
fell
with
singular
soothing
power
upon
the
heart
which
had
come
to
a
knowledge
of
its
own
weakness
in
these
last
tedious
months
and
as
nettie
sat
with
all
the
remorseful
thoughts
of
nature
in
her
softened
heart
the
impossibility
of
impressing
her
own
emotions
upon
those
around
her
struck
her
with
a
deeper
sense
of
impatience
disappointment
and
disgust
than
ever
before
when
she
went
softly
into
the
darkened
room
where
susan
lay
in
her
gloomy
bed
divided
between
wailings
over
the
injuries
which
poor
fred
had
suffered
the
harshness
that
had
driven
him
out
of
doors
and
the
want
of
his
brother
or
somebody
to
take
care
of
him
which
had
brought
the
poor
fellow
to
such
an
end
and
complaints
of
the
wrong
done
to
herself
the
want
of
feeling
shown
by
her
sister
the
neglect
with
which
she
was
treated
nettie
gazed
at
the
sobbing
creature
with
eyes
unconsciously
wondering
yet
but
she
knew
very
well
beforehand
that
this
was
how
her
dreadful
tidings
would
be
received
yet
out
of
her
own
softened
awed
compunctious
heart
her
pity
too
deep
for
tears
over
that
lost
life
nettie
looked
with
the
unbelief
of
nature
at
the
widowed
woman
the
creature
who
had
loved
him
and
been
his
wife
yet
who
could
only
think
of
somebody
else
to
be
blamed
and
of
herself
injured
at
that
terrible
moment
when
the
companion
of
her
life
was
violently
withdrawn
from
her
and
to
go
out
of
that
obstinately
darkened
refuge
of
fretful
sorrow
into
the
room
where
the
blind
had
been
drawn
up
the
moment
her
back
was
turned
and
where
these
three
tearless
children
totally
unimpressed
by
the
information
which
they
had
received
as
a
piece
of
news
with
mingled
curiosity
and
scepticism
occupied
themselves
with
their
usual
sports
or
listened
keenly
with
sharp
remarks
to
the
sounds
below
which
only
the
utmost
stretch
of
nettie
authority
could
keep
them
from
descending
to
investigate
afforded
a
wonderful
reverse
to
the
picture
which
startled
her
in
her
momentary
clearsightedness
the
contrast
between
her
own
feelings
she
who
had
no
bonds
of
natural
affection
to
fred
and
to
whom
he
had
been
by
times
a
very
irksome
burden
and
theirs
who
were
his
very
own
and
belonged
to
him
appeared
to
nettie
as
no
such
contrast
had
ever
appeared
before
heart
alone
was
heavy
with
regret
over
the
ruined
man
the
now
for
ever
unredeemable
life
she
only
to
whom
his
death
was
no
loss
but
even
if
she
could
have
permitted
that
cruel
thought
to
intervene
a
gain
and
relief
recognised
with
a
pang
of
compassion
almost
as
sharp
as
grief
that
grievous
miserable
fate
when
a
few
minutes
after
the
noise
of
the
children
play
rose
to
an
outburst
nettie
flushed
into
a
momentary
effusion
of
temper
and
silenced
the
heartless
imps
with
a
voice
and
look
which
they
dared
not
venture
to
resist
her
rebuke
was
however
interrupted
by
a
sudden
call
from
their
mother
how
can
you
have
the
heart
oh
nettie
nettie
i
knew
you
had
no
feeling
you
never
had
any
feeling
since
you
were
a
baby
but
how
can
you
speak
so
to
his
poor
children
now
that
he
has
left
them
on
the
cold
world
cried
susan
sobbing
from
her
bed
if
nettie
sprang
to
her
feet
in
sudden
heat
and
disgust
and
peremptorily
closed
the
doors
intervening
between
the
children
and
their
mother
nobody
will
much
wonder
at
that
movement
of
impatience
perhaps
nettie
eyes
had
never
been
so
entirely
opened
to
the
hopeless
character
of
the
charge
she
had
taken
upon
her
as
in
the
temporary
seclusion
of
that
day
and
meanwhile
edward
rider
was
superintending
all
the
arrangements
of
the
time
for
nettie
sake
not
because
it
was
his
brother
who
lay
there
no
longer
a
burden
to
any
man
nor
because
natural
duty
pointed
him
out
as
the
natural
guardian
of
the
orphaned
family
the
doctor
indeed
would
have
done
his
duty
in
such
a
hard
case
however
it
had
been
required
of
him
but
the
circumstances
were
different
now
the
melancholy
bustle
the
shame
the
consciousness
that
everybody
knew
what
manner
of
existence
this
lost
life
had
been
the
exposure
the
publicity
all
that
would
have
wrung
with
a
hundred
sharp
wounds
a
spirit
so
susceptible
to
public
comments
came
with
dulled
force
upon
the
doctor
mind
when
the
people
about
saw
the
grave
and
seemly
composure
with
which
he
went
about
this
dismal
business
without
those
starts
and
flushes
of
grievous
irritation
and
shame
which
the
very
mention
of
his
brother
had
once
brought
upon
him
they
believed
and
honoured
him
in
the
belief
that
death
had
awakened
the
ancient
fraternal
kindness
in
edward
rider
heart
but
it
was
not
fraternal
kindness
that
smoothed
off
the
rude
edges
of
that
burden
it
was
the
consciousness
of
doing
nettie
work
for
her
taking
her
place
sparing
that
creature
over
whom
his
heart
yearned
the
hardest
and
painfulest
business
she
had
yet
been
involved
in
we
can
not
take
credit
for
the
doctor
which
he
did
not
deserve
he
forgave
fred
when
he
saw
his
motionless
figure
never
more
to
do
evil
or
offend
in
this
world
laid
in
pitiful
solitude
in
that
room
which
still
was
nettie
room
and
which
even
in
death
he
grudged
to
his
brother
but
edward
distinct
apprehension
of
right
and
wrong
and
fred
deserts
in
this
world
were
not
altered
by
that
diviner
compunction
which
had
moved
nettie
he
forgave
but
did
not
forget
nor
defend
with
remorseful
tenderness
his
brother
memory
not
for
fred
sake
but
nettie
he
held
his
place
in
the
troubled
cottage
and
assumed
the
position
of
head
of
the
family
hard
certainties
of
experience
prevented
the
doctor
unimaginative
mind
from
respecting
here
the
ideal
anguish
of
sudden
widowhood
and
bereavement
this
was
a
conclusion
noways
unnatural
or
surprising
for
such
a
life
as
fred
and
edward
knew
with
that
contemptuous
hardness
into
which
incessant
personal
contact
with
the
world
drives
most
men
that
neither
the
wife
nor
the
children
were
capable
of
deep
or
permanent
feeling
they
will
only
hang
upon
all
the
heavier
he
said
to
himself
bitterly
and
for
her
with
repentant
love
edward
rider
exerted
himself
in
all
the
house
no
heart
but
nettie
alone
acknowledged
an
ache
of
pity
for
fred
and
his
ruined
life
mrs
rider
to
be
sure
will
feel
at
first
it
only
natural
said
mrs
smith
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
looked
for
and
if
it
were
not
hardhearted
to
say
it
and
him
lying
in
his
coffin
they
be
a
deal
better
off
without
him
nor
with
him
but
smith
and
me
we
have
ourselves
to
look
to
and
it
a
terrible
blow
is
this
to
a
house
as
was
always
as
respectable
as
a
one
in
carlingford
the
lodgings
is
ruined
the
very
marks
of
the
feet
if
it
was
nothing
else
cried
the
afflicted
landlady
contemplating
the
scratched
tiles
in
the
hall
with
actual
tears
of
vexation
and
regret
but
this
was
the
true
state
of
the
case
to
every
unconcerned
spectator
only
nettie
on
whom
the
burden
had
fallen
and
was
yet
to
fall
heaviest
felt
the
eyes
which
were
hot
and
heavy
with
watching
grow
dim
with
tears
of
unspeakable
compassion
from
the
fulness
of
her
youth
and
strength
strength
so
burdened
youth
so
dauntless
and
dutiful
nettie
gazed
with
a
pity
too
deep
for
words
at
the
awful
spectacle
of
that
existence
lost
that
the
lifeless
thing
in
the
room
below
could
have
been
a
man
and
yet
have
come
and
gone
so
disastrously
through
the
world
was
terrible
to
think
of
to
that
living
labouring
creature
in
the
depth
of
her
own
strange
toils
and
responsibilities
her
heart
ached
over
that
wretched
miserable
fate
neither
toil
nor
anguish
was
to
be
compared
to
the
dread
loss
of
a
life
sustained
by
that
departed
soul
chapter
xii
in
a
few
days
all
this
solemn
crisis
was
over
and
life
went
on
again
in
its
ordinary
tame
current
closing
over
the
dishonoured
grave
where
fred
found
his
rest
henceforward
nameless
in
the
world
that
had
suffered
his
existence
as
a
cumberer
of
the
ground
for
so
many
years
had
he
been
the
prop
of
his
house
and
the
light
of
their
eyes
life
would
have
gone
on
again
after
that
interruption
all
the
same
with
a
persistency
which
nothing
can
impair
as
it
was
the
diminished
household
resumed
its
ordinary
course
of
existence
after
a
very
few
days
with
little
more
than
outward
marks
of
what
had
befallen
them
it
is
true
that
nettie
sat
down
with
a
repugnance
which
she
scarcely
could
either
overcome
or
conceal
to
dispense
the
domestic
provisions
at
the
table
which
shortly
before
had
borne
so
dread
a
burden
but
nobody
thought
of
that
except
nettie
and
but
for
the
black
dresses
and
susan
cap
fred
was
as
if
he
had
never
been
about
a
week
after
the
funeral
the
doctor
went
solemnly
to
visit
them
in
one
of
those
lengthening
spring
afternoons
dr
rider
was
undeniably
nervous
and
excited
about
this
interview
he
had
been
at
home
under
pretence
of
having
luncheon
but
in
reality
to
make
a
solemn
toilette
and
wind
himself
up
to
the
courage
necessary
for
a
settlement
of
affairs
as
he
dashed
with
agitated
haste
down
grange
lane
he
saw
miss
wodehouse
and
her
sister
lucy
coming
from
st
roque
where
very
probably
they
too
had
been
making
a
visit
of
condolence
to
nettie
and
a
little
nearer
that
scene
of
all
his
cogitations
and
troubles
appeared
a
much
less
welcome
sight
miss
marjoribanks
whom
all
carlingford
a
month
ago
had
declared
dr
rider
to
be
paying
his
addresses
to
the
guilty
doctor
took
off
his
hat
to
that
stout
and
sensible
wayfarer
with
a
pang
of
which
avenged
nettie
along
the
very
road
where
that
little
titania
eager
and
rapid
had
gone
upon
her
dauntless
way
so
often
to
see
that
comely
figure
handsome
sprightly
clever
but
with
such
a
world
of
bright
youth
tenderness
loveliness
everything
that
touches
the
heart
of
man
between
the
two
no
harm
to
miss
marjoribanks
only
shame
to
the
doctor
who
out
of
angry
love
pique
and
mortification
to
vex
nettie
had
pretended
to
transfer
the
homage
due
to
the
fairy
princess
to
that
handsome
and
judicious
woman
the
experiment
had
failed
as
entirely
as
it
deserved
to
do
and
here
was
edward
rider
coming
back
wiser
and
humbler
content
to
put
that
question
over
again
and
stand
once
more
his
chance
of
what
his
pride
had
called
a
rejection
perhaps
content
to
make
still
greater
sacrifices
if
the
truth
were
known
and
to
do
anything
nettie
asked
him
if
nettie
would
but
condescend
to
ask
or
enter
into
terms
at
all
he
drew
up
before
st
roque
with
a
dash
which
was
much
more
of
agitation
than
display
and
throwing
the
reins
at
the
head
of
his
little
groom
leaped
out
like
a
man
who
did
not
see
where
he
was
going
he
saw
mr
wentworth
however
coming
out
of
the
church
and
turning
round
amazed
to
look
what
vehicle
had
come
to
so
sudden
a
standstill
there
all
the
world
seemed
to
be
on
the
road
to
st
roque
cottage
that
spring
afternoon
the
doctor
made
a
surly
gesture
of
recognition
as
he
passed
the
curate
who
gazed
at
him
in
calm
astonishment
from
the
church
porch
no
other
intruder
appeared
between
him
and
the
cottage
he
hurried
along
past
the
with
their
drooping
tassels
surrounded
by
a
certain
maze
of
excitement
and
agitation
as
he
went
up
to
the
door
it
occurred
to
him
suddenly
how
nettie
had
recognised
his
step
that
dread
morning
of
fred
death
the
thought
came
like
a
stimulus
and
encouragement
to
the
doctor
he
went
in
with
a
brighter
look
a
heart
more
hopeful
she
had
opened
the
door
to
him
before
he
could
knock
held
out
to
him
that
tiny
morsel
of
a
hand
which
laboured
so
hard
and
constantly
said
what
did
nettie
say
how
many
times
had
the
doctor
conned
it
over
as
he
went
between
his
patients
you
were
angry
once
and
indeed
i
do
wonder
the
doctor
went
boldly
in
under
the
cordial
of
these
simple
words
if
she
did
not
wonder
that
he
was
angry
once
could
she
think
of
saying
over
again
that
same
conclusion
which
had
cast
him
into
such
wrathful
despair
he
went
in
to
try
his
fortune
a
second
time
secure
of
his
temper
at
least
could
never
fail
nor
sin
against
nettie
again
edward
rider
went
in
expectant
somehow
even
against
his
reason
to
find
an
altered
world
in
that
house
from
which
fred
had
gone
he
knew
better
to
be
sure
but
nature
beguiled
the
young
man
out
of
his
wisdom
when
he
went
in
to
the
parlour
his
eyes
were
opened
upon
the
sofa
that
same
sofa
where
fred
had
lain
all
slovenly
and
mean
in
his
idleness
with
his
pipe
polluting
nettie
sole
retirement
mrs
fred
lay
now
in
her
sombre
black
dress
with
the
white
cap
circling
her
faded
face
she
had
her
white
handkerchief
in
her
hand
and
was
carefully
arranged
upon
the
sofa
with
a
chair
placed
near
for
sympathisers
at
the
table
working
rapidly
as
usual
sat
nettie
sometimes
she
turned
a
momentary
glance
of
mingled
curiosity
and
wonder
upon
her
sister
evidently
she
did
not
interfere
with
this
development
of
sorrow
nettie
had
enough
to
do
besides
with
her
needlework
and
to
enjoin
a
moderate
amount
of
quietness
upon
freddy
and
his
little
sister
who
were
building
wooden
bricks
into
houses
and
castles
on
the
floor
by
her
side
when
the
doctor
entered
the
room
he
saw
how
it
was
with
instantaneous
insight
mrs
fred
was
sitting
in
state
in
the
pomp
of
woe
to
receive
all
the
compassionate
people
who
might
come
to
condole
with
her
nettie
half
impatient
half
glad
that
her
sister
could
amuse
herself
so
sat
in
busy
toleration
putting
up
with
it
carrying
on
her
own
work
through
it
all
and
still
as
always
those
bonds
of
her
own
making
closed
hard
and
tenacious
upon
the
prop
of
the
house
even
the
chance
of
speaking
with
her
by
herself
died
off
into
extreme
distance
young
rider
who
came
in
with
the
full
conviction
that
anger
could
never
more
rise
in
his
heart
against
nettie
grew
pale
with
passion
resentment
and
impatience
before
he
had
been
a
minute
in
the
room
always
the
same
not
relieved
out
of
her
bondage
closer
bound
and
prisoned
than
ever
he
took
with
an
impatient
involuntary
commotion
the
chair
placed
beside
the
sofa
and
sat
down
in
it
abruptly
with
the
briefest
salutations
his
hopes
and
anticipations
all
went
bitterly
back
upon
his
heart
the
very
rustle
of
nettie
arm
as
she
spread
out
that
little
black
frock
upon
the
table
and
put
on
its
melancholy
trimmings
exasperated
afresh
the
man
who
five
minutes
ago
did
not
believe
it
possible
that
he
ever
could
feel
an
impulse
of
displeasure
against
her
again
i
can
not
say
that
i
expected
to
see
you
mr
edward
said
mrs
fred
lifting
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
indeed
when
i
remember
the
last
time
you
were
here
i
wonder
you
could
think
of
coming
near
us
but
now
my
poor
dear
fred
is
gone
we
have
nobody
to
protect
us
and
of
course
you
do
mind
how
you
hurt
my
feelings
if
you
had
done
your
duty
by
my
poor
fellow
when
he
was
living
he
might
never
never
here
mrs
fred
paused
choked
by
spiteful
tears
dr
edward
do
mind
what
susan
says
said
nettie
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
after
everything
if
you
would
only
tell
the
people
not
to
take
any
notice
but
just
to
let
us
go
on
as
usual
they
all
want
to
be
kind
you
know
they
keep
coming
and
asking
what
they
can
do
and
you
understand
very
well
there
is
nothing
to
do
said
nettie
with
a
little
pride
we
are
just
as
we
were
before
nothing
is
changed
one
does
not
like
to
be
unkind
but
nobody
needs
to
do
anything
we
shall
get
along
all
the
same
so
it
seems
indeed
said
dr
rider
with
irrepressible
bitterness
all
the
same
but
indeed
i
came
specially
to
ask
what
my
meant
to
do
continued
the
doctor
bent
on
one
last
appeal
now
that
you
are
left
to
yourself
mrs
rider
what
do
you
think
of
doing
of
course
you
must
have
some
plans
about
the
children
and
your
future
life
mrs
fred
looked
up
at
him
with
momentary
alarm
and
dismay
she
did
not
know
what
the
question
meant
but
a
certain
vague
terror
seized
her
it
seemed
to
imply
somehow
that
she
was
now
to
be
left
to
her
own
resources
she
gave
a
certain
gasp
of
appeal
to
nettie
and
took
refuge
once
more
in
her
handkerchief
the
doctor
was
desperate
he
had
no
mercy
in
him
nettie
always
nettie
cried
the
young
man
and
is
it
true
nettie
is
it
all
the
same
are
you
always
to
go
on
toiling
for
the
miserable
comforts
of
other
people
what
is
to
become
of
us
have
you
sold
yourself
to
this
fate
nettie
laid
down
the
little
black
frock
out
of
her
laborious
hands
you
have
been
up
all
night
dr
edward
she
said
with
a
certain
tenderness
looking
at
his
agitated
face
you
are
tired
out
and
sick
at
the
heart
i
know
it
makes
you
say
things
you
would
not
say
but
after
all
you
know
except
poor
fred
whom
none
of
you
think
of
everything
is
the
very
same
i
can
not
make
it
different
nothing
can
make
it
different
there
is
susan
plain
enough
to
be
seen
and
there
are
the
children
sometimes
it
has
come
into
my
mind
said
nettie
that
as
i
shall
never
be
able
to
afford
a
good
education
for
the
children
it
would
be
better
to
take
them
out
to
the
colony
again
where
they
might
get
on
better
than
here
but
it
is
a
dreadful
long
voyage
and
we
have
no
near
friends
there
or
anywhere
else
and
concluded
the
steadfast
creature
who
had
dropped
these
last
words
from
her
lips
sentence
by
sentence
as
if
eager
to
impress
upon
her
own
mind
the
arguments
against
that
proceeding
and
said
nettie
with
wistful
pathetic
honesty
not
able
to
deny
the
real
cause
of
the
reluctance
altogether
i
do
seem
to
have
the
heart
for
it
now
dr
rider
started
up
from
his
chair
he
went
to
nettie
side
with
a
sudden
thrill
of
agitation
and
passion
he
clasped
the
hand
with
which
nettie
was
smoothing
out
that
little
frock
and
crushed
the
delicate
fingers
in
his
inconsiderate
grasp
nettie
if
you
must
carry
them
always
upon
your
shoulders
can
not
we
do
it
together
at
least
cried
the
doctor
carried
away
beyond
every
boundary
of
sense
or
prudence
he
got
down
on
his
knees
beside
the
table
not
kneeling
to
her
but
only
compelling
her
attention
demanding
to
see
the
answer
of
her
eyes
the
quiver
of
her
mouth
for
that
moment
nettie
defences
too
fell
before
this
outburst
of
a
love
that
had
forgotten
prudence
her
mouth
quivered
her
eyes
filled
if
it
were
possible
if
it
were
only
possible
they
had
both
forgotten
the
spectators
who
gazed
with
curious
eyes
all
unaware
how
deeply
their
own
fate
was
involved
and
that
fate
was
still
trembling
in
the
breathless
interval
when
a
vulgar
finger
touched
those
delicate
balances
of
possibility
and
the
crisis
was
over
perhaps
never
to
return
nettie
cried
mrs
fred
if
edward
rider
has
no
respect
for
me
nor
for
my
poor
fred
my
poor
dear
injured
husband
that
helped
to
bring
him
up
and
gave
up
his
practice
to
him
and
died
as
i
might
say
by
his
neglect
nettie
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
to
your
sister
how
can
you
go
taking
his
hand
and
looking
as
if
he
were
your
lover
you
never
had
any
feeling
for
me
though
everybody
thinks
so
much
of
you
and
now
i
know
what
i
have
to
expect
the
moment
my
poor
dear
fred
head
is
laid
in
the
grave
as
soon
as
ever
you
have
me
in
your
own
hands
and
nobody
to
protect
me
oh
my
fred
my
fred
as
soon
as
you
are
gone
this
is
how
they
are
using
your
poor
helpless
family
and
soon
soon
i
shall
die
too
and
you
will
not
be
encumbered
with
long
before
this
sobbing
speech
was
concluded
dr
rider
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
pacing
through
the
little
room
with
hasty
steps
of
disgust
and
rage
and
an
agitation
which
overwhelmed
all
his
attempts
to
master
it
while
nettie
sat
supporting
her
head
in
her
hands
pressing
her
fingers
upon
her
hot
eyes
beholding
that
fair
impossible
vision
break
and
disappear
from
before
her
nettie
heart
groaned
within
her
and
beat
against
the
delicate
bosom
which
in
its
tender
weakness
was
mighty
as
a
giant
she
made
no
answer
to
her
sister
outcry
nor
attempted
to
comfort
the
hysterical
sobbing
into
which
susan
fell
nettie
gave
up
the
hopeless
business
without
being
deceived
by
those
selfish
demonstrations
she
was
not
even
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
persuade
herself
into
admiring
love
and
enthusiasm
for
those
to
whom
necessity
obliged
her
to
give
up
her
own
life
she
said
nothing
she
knew
the
sobs
would
subside
the
end
would
be
gained
the
insignificant
soul
lapse
into
comfort
and
with
a
sigh
of
compulsory
resignation
nettie
yielded
once
more
to
her
fate
dr
edward
do
not
think
of
me
any
more
she
said
resolutely
rising
and
going
out
to
the
door
with
him
in
her
simplicity
and
courage
you
see
very
well
it
is
impossible
i
know
you
see
it
as
well
as
i
do
if
we
could
be
friends
as
we
once
were
i
should
be
very
very
glad
but
i
do
think
it
is
possible
just
now
do
say
anything
we
both
know
how
it
is
and
neither
of
us
can
help
it
if
we
could
get
not
to
think
of
each
other
that
would
be
best
said
nettie
with
another
sigh
but
in
the
mean
time
let
us
say
and
speak
of
it
no
more
if
the
doctor
did
not
take
his
dismissal
exactly
so
if
identification
of
her
own
sentiments
with
his
did
lead
to
a
warmer
tenderness
in
that
farewell
which
could
not
be
final
while
such
a
bond
united
them
it
was
at
least
with
an
absolute
conviction
of
the
impossibility
of
any
closer
union
that
they
parted
the
doctor
sprang
into
his
drag
and
dashed
away
to
his
patients
plunging
into
the
work
which
he
had
somewhat
neglected
during
that
exciting
day
he
was
not
without
some
comfort
as
he
went
about
his
business
with
care
behind
him
but
that
very
comfort
embittered
the
pang
of
the
compulsory
submission
to
think
he
must
leave
her
there
with
those
burdens
upon
her
delicate
shoulders
to
believe
her
his
yet
not
his
the
victim
of
an
unnatural
bondage
drove
edward
rider
desperate
as
he
devoured
the
way
a
hundred
times
in
an
hour
he
made
up
his
mind
to
hasten
back
again
and
snatch
her
forcibly
out
of
that
thraldom
and
yet
a
hundred
times
had
to
fall
back
consuming
his
heart
with
fiery
irritation
and
chafing
at
all
that
seemed
duty
and
necessity
to
nettie
as
he
was
proceeding
on
his
troubled
way
it
occurred
to
him
to
meet
surely
everybody
in
carlingford
was
out
of
doors
this
particular
afternoon
that
prosperous
wife
mrs
john
brown
who
had
once
been
bessie
christian
she
was
a
very
pale
apparition
now
to
the
doctor
engrossed
as
he
was
with
an
influence
much
more
imperious
and
enthralling
than
hers
had
ever
been
but
the
sight
of
her
on
this
day
of
all
others
was
not
without
its
effect
upon
edward
rider
had
not
she
too
been
burdened
with
responsibilities
which
the
doctor
would
not
venture
to
take
upon
his
shoulders
but
which
another
man
more
daring
taken
and
rendered
bearable
as
the
thought
of
that
possibility
occurred
to
him
a
sudden
vision
of
mrs
fred
faded
figure
flashed
across
his
eyes
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
touched
too
sharply
with
his
whip
that
horse
which
had
suffered
the
penalty
of
most
of
his
vagaries
of
temper
and
imagination
for
some
time
past
the
beast
was
aggravated
out
of
patience
by
that
unexpected
irritation
it
was
all
the
doctor
could
do
for
the
next
ten
minutes
to
keep
his
seat
and
his
command
over
the
exasperated
animal
whose
sudden
frenzy
terrified
mrs
brown
and
drove
her
to
take
refuge
in
the
nearest
shop
how
little
the
carlingford
public
who
paused
at
a
respectful
distance
to
look
on
guessed
those
emotions
which
moved
the
doctor
as
they
watched
him
subduing
his
rebellious
horse
with
vigorous
arm
and
passionate
looks
bessie
with
a
little
palpitation
at
her
heart
could
not
refrain
from
a
passing
wonder
whether
the
sight
of
herself
had
anything
to
do
with
that
sudden
conflict
mrs
brown
knew
little
about
st
roque
cottage
but
had
heard
of
miss
marjoribanks
who
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
could
hold
a
very
absolute
sway
over
the
doctor
meanwhile
dr
rider
struggled
with
his
horse
with
all
the
intensity
of
determination
with
which
he
would
have
struggled
against
his
fate
had
that
been
practicable
with
set
teeth
and
eyes
that
blazed
with
sudden
rage
and
resolution
he
subdued
the
unruly
brute
and
forced
it
to
acknowledge
his
mastery
when
he
drove
the
vanquished
animal
all
quivering
with
pain
and
passion
on
its
further
course
the
struggle
had
refreshed
his
mind
a
little
ah
if
life
and
adverse
fortune
could
but
be
vanquished
so
but
all
edward
rider
resolution
and
courage
died
into
hopeless
disgust
before
the
recollection
of
mrs
fred
upon
that
sofa
even
with
nettie
at
one
hand
that
peevish
phantom
on
the
other
those
heartless
imps
in
insolent
possession
of
the
wonderful
little
guardian
who
would
not
forsake
them
made
up
a
picture
which
made
the
doctor
heart
sick
no
nettie
was
right
it
was
impossible
love
patience
charity
after
all
are
but
human
qualities
when
they
have
to
be
held
against
daily
disgusts
irritations
and
miseries
the
doctor
knew
as
well
as
nettie
did
that
he
could
not
bear
it
he
knew
even
as
perhaps
nettie
did
not
know
that
her
own
image
would
suffer
from
the
association
and
that
a
man
so
faulty
and
imperfect
as
himself
could
not
long
refrain
from
resenting
upon
his
wife
the
dismal
restraints
of
such
a
burden
with
a
which
was
most
cutting
of
all
edward
rider
felt
that
he
should
descend
to
that
injustice
and
that
not
even
nettie
herself
would
be
safe
against
the
effusions
of
his
impatience
and
indignation
all
through
the
course
of
this
exciting
episode
in
his
life
his
own
foresight
and
knowledge
of
himself
had
been
torture
to
the
doctor
and
had
brought
him
in
addition
to
all
other
trials
silent
agonies
of
which
nobody
could
guess
but
he
could
not
alter
his
nature
he
went
through
his
day
work
very
wretched
and
dejected
yet
with
an
ineffable
touch
of
secret
comfort
behind
all
which
sometimes
would
look
him
in
the
face
for
a
moment
like
a
passing
sunbeam
yet
sometimes
seemed
to
exasperate
beyond
bearing
the
tantalising
misery
of
his
fate
a
more
agitated
disturbed
passionate
and
man
than
the
doctor
was
not
in
carlingford
nor
within
a
hundred
miles
yet
it
was
not
perfect
wretchedness
after
all
nettie
on
her
part
went
back
to
mrs
fred
in
the
parlour
after
she
had
parted
from
edward
rider
with
feelings
somewhat
different
from
the
doctor
perhaps
she
too
had
indulged
a
certain
pang
of
expectation
as
to
what
might
follow
after
fred
was
gone
in
the
new
world
that
should
be
after
that
change
for
nettie
with
all
her
wisdom
of
experience
was
still
too
young
not
to
believe
that
circumstances
did
change
everything
now
and
then
even
dispositions
and
hearts
but
before
dr
rider
knew
it
before
he
had
even
wound
up
his
courage
to
the
pitch
of
asking
what
was
now
to
happen
to
them
the
little
australian
had
made
up
her
mind
to
that
which
was
inevitable
the
same
susan
whose
ceaseless
discontents
and
selfish
love
had
driven
nettie
across
the
seas
to
look
for
fred
was
now
reposing
on
that
sofa
in
her
widow
cap
altogether
unchanged
as
helpless
and
unabandonable
as
dependent
as
much
a
fool
as
ever
the
superior
wretchedness
of
fred
presence
and
life
had
partially
veiled
susan
character
since
they
came
to
carlingford
now
she
had
the
field
to
herself
again
and
nettie
recognised
at
once
the
familiar
picture
from
the
moment
when
susan
in
her
mourning
came
nettie
acknowledged
the
weakness
of
circumstances
the
pertinacity
of
nature
what
could
she
do
she
gave
up
the
germ
of
hope
that
had
begun
to
appear
in
her
breast
she
made
up
her
mind
silently
to
what
must
be
no
agonies
of
martyrdom
could
have
made
nettie
desert
her
post
and
abandon
these
helpless
souls
they
could
do
nothing
for
themselves
old
or
young
of
them
and
who
was
there
to
do
it
all
she
asked
herself
with
that
perpetual
reference
to
necessity
which
was
nettie
sole
process
of
reasoning
on
the
subject
thus
considered
the
arguments
were
short
and
telling
the
conclusion
unmistakable
here
was
this
visible
piece
of
business
four
helpless
creatures
to
be
supported
and
provided
and
thrust
through
life
somehow
with
nobody
in
the
world
but
nettie
to
do
it
to
bring
them
daily
bread
and
hourly
tendance
to
keep
them
alive
and
shelter
their
helplessness
with
refuge
and
protection
she
drew
up
her
tiny
titania
figure
and
put
back
her
silken
flood
of
hair
and
stood
upright
to
the
full
extent
of
her
little
stature
when
she
recognised
the
truth
nobody
could
share
with
her
that
warfare
which
was
hard
to
flesh
and
blood
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
on
the
subject
no
possibility
of
help
she
was
almost
glad
when
that
interview
which
she
foresaw
was
over
and
when
edward
had
recognised
as
well
as
herself
the
necessities
of
the
matter
she
went
back
again
out
of
the
little
hall
where
for
one
moment
and
no
more
the
lights
of
youth
and
love
had
flushed
over
nettie
suffusing
her
paleness
with
now
it
was
all
over
the
romance
was
ended
the
hero
gone
and
life
had
begun
anew
i
ca
say
i
ever
liked
this
place
sighed
mrs
fred
when
the
lamp
was
lit
that
evening
and
nettie
had
come
again
after
seeing
the
children
in
bed
it
was
always
dull
and
dreary
to
me
if
we
been
so
far
out
of
carlingford
things
might
have
been
very
different
my
poor
fred
instead
of
taking
care
of
him
all
the
dangers
that
ever
could
be
were
put
in
his
way
this
sentence
was
concluded
by
some
weeping
of
which
however
nettie
did
not
take
any
notice
making
mourning
by
is
hard
work
as
all
poor
seamstresses
know
nettie
had
no
tears
in
the
eyes
that
were
fixed
intently
upon
the
little
coat
which
was
to
complete
outfit
and
she
did
not
even
look
up
from
that
urgent
occupation
to
deprecate
susan
tears
i
tell
you
nettie
i
never
could
bear
this
place
said
mrs
fred
and
now
whenever
i
move
the
dreadful
thoughts
that
come
into
my
mind
are
enough
to
kill
me
you
always
were
strong
from
a
baby
and
of
course
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
you
can
understand
what
my
feelings
are
and
mrs
smith
is
anything
but
kind
or
indeed
civil
sometimes
and
i
think
i
could
live
through
another
of
these
cold
english
winters
i
am
sure
i
never
could
keep
alive
through
another
winter
now
my
poor
gone
well
asked
nettie
with
involuntary
harshness
in
her
voice
i
do
care
for
myself
sobbed
mrs
fred
but
it
dreadful
to
see
you
so
unfeeling
and
to
think
what
would
become
of
his
poor
children
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
me
i
do
believe
you
would
marry
edward
rider
if
it
were
not
for
me
and
go
and
wrong
the
poor
children
and
leave
them
destitute
nobody
has
the
feeling
for
them
that
a
mother
has
but
if
i
live
another
winter
in
england
i
know
i
shall
die
you
have
thought
of
dying
a
great
many
times
said
nettie
but
it
has
never
come
to
anything
never
mind
that
just
now
what
do
you
want
do
you
want
me
to
take
you
back
to
the
colony
all
these
thousands
of
miles
after
so
many
expenses
as
there
have
been
already
or
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
you
always
speak
of
expenses
nettie
you
are
very
though
people
think
so
much
of
you
said
susan
and
do
you
think
it
is
natural
i
should
wish
to
go
home
now
my
poor
fred
has
been
taken
away
from
me
and
you
confessed
it
would
be
best
for
the
children
we
know
scarcely
anybody
here
and
the
very
sight
of
edward
that
was
so
cruel
to
my
poor
fred
susan
do
be
a
fool
said
nettie
you
know
better
in
your
heart
if
you
will
tell
me
plainly
what
you
want
i
shall
listen
to
you
but
if
not
i
will
go
and
put
away
freddy
things
only
one
thing
i
may
tell
you
at
once
you
may
leave
carlingford
if
you
please
but
i
shall
not
i
can
not
take
you
back
again
to
have
you
ill
all
the
way
and
the
children
threatening
to
fall
overboard
twenty
times
in
a
day
i
did
it
once
but
i
will
not
do
it
again
you
not
cried
susan
ah
i
know
what
you
mean
i
know
very
well
what
you
mean
you
think
edward
rider
nettie
rose
up
and
faced
her
sister
with
a
little
gasp
of
resolution
which
frightened
mrs
fred
i
do
intend
to
have
anything
said
about
edward
rider
said
nettie
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
one
way
or
another
i
tell
you
what
i
told
him
that
i
have
not
the
heart
to
carry
you
all
back
again
and
i
can
not
afford
it
either
and
if
you
want
anything
more
susan
added
the
peremptory
creature
flashing
forth
into
something
of
her
old
spirit
i
sha
go
and
that
is
surely
enough
with
which
words
nettie
went
off
like
a
little
sprite
to
put
away
freddy
coat
newly
completed
along
with
the
other
articles
of
his
wardrobe
at
which
she
had
been
working
all
day
in
that
momentary
impulse
of
decision
and
a
few
notes
of
a
song
came
unawares
from
nettie
lip
as
she
glanced
light
and
rapid
as
a
fairy
she
stopped
a
minute
after
with
a
sigh
were
nettie
singing
days
over
she
had
at
least
come
at
last
to
find
her
life
hard
and
to
acknowledge
that
this
necessity
which
was
laid
upon
her
was
grievous
by
times
to
flesh
and
blood
but
not
the
less
for
that
did
she
arrange
little
garments
daintily
in
the
drawers
and
pause
before
she
went
again
to
cover
him
up
in
his
little
bed
susan
still
sat
pondering
and
crying
over
the
fire
her
tears
were
a
great
resource
to
mrs
fred
they
occupied
her
when
she
had
nothing
else
to
occupy
herself
with
and
when
she
cast
a
weeping
glance
up
from
her
handkerchief
to
see
nettie
draw
her
chair
again
to
the
table
and
lay
down
a
little
pile
of
pinafores
and
tuckers
which
required
supervision
susan
wept
still
more
and
said
it
was
well
to
be
nettie
who
never
was
overcome
by
her
feelings
thus
the
evening
passed
dully
enough
just
then
perhaps
nettie
was
not
a
very
conversable
companion
such
interviews
as
that
of
this
day
linger
in
the
heads
of
the
interlocutors
and
perhaps
produce
more
notable
effects
afterwards
than
at
the
moment
nettie
was
not
thinking
about
it
she
was
simply
going
over
it
again
finding
out
the
tones
and
meanings
which
in
the
haste
and
excitement
of
their
occurrence
did
not
have
their
full
force
the
fulness
of
detail
that
lingers
about
such
pictures
which
are
not
half
apprehended
till
they
have
been
gone
over
again
and
again
is
marvellous
the
pinafores
went
unconsciously
through
nettie
fingers
she
was
scarcely
aware
of
susan
crying
by
the
fire
though
it
had
been
in
some
degree
a
final
and
almost
hopeless
parting
there
was
comfort
behind
the
cloud
to
nettie
as
well
as
to
the
doctor
she
had
forgotten
all
about
the
discussion
with
which
the
evening
began
before
susan
spoke
again
richard
chatham
came
home
with
the
last
mail
said
susan
making
a
feeble
effort
to
renew
the
fight
he
sent
me
a
letter
last
week
you
know
i
daresay
he
will
come
to
see
us
richard
chatham
from
melbourne
nettie
i
daresay
he
will
not
stay
out
of
the
colony
long
nettie
who
was
lost
in
her
own
thoughts
made
no
reply
i
daresay
repeated
mrs
fred
he
will
be
going
out
again
in
a
month
or
two
i
do
not
believe
he
could
bear
this
dreadful
english
winter
any
more
than
i
could
i
daresay
he
be
glad
to
take
care
of
us
out
if
you
should
change
your
mind
about
going
nettie
nettie
gave
her
sister
a
glance
of
resolution
and
impatience
a
swift
glance
upward
from
her
work
enough
to
show
she
marked
and
understood
but
still
did
not
speak
richard
chatham
was
always
very
it
would
be
such
a
good
thing
for
us
to
go
in
the
same
ship
if
you
should
happen
to
change
your
mind
about
going
nettie
said
mrs
fred
rising
to
retire
to
her
room
i
am
going
to
bed
to
try
to
get
a
little
sleep
such
wretched
nights
as
i
have
would
kill
anybody
i
should
not
wonder
if
richard
chatham
came
some
of
these
days
to
see
us
poor
fellow
he
had
always
a
great
fancy
for
family
and
it
would
be
a
thing
for
us
nettie
if
you
should
change
your
mind
about
going
to
go
in
the
same
ship
with
which
parthian
shot
mrs
fred
made
her
way
and
retired
from
the
field
nettie
woke
with
a
startled
consciousness
out
of
her
dreams
to
perceive
that
here
was
the
process
of
iteration
begun
which
drives
the
wisest
to
do
the
will
of
fools
she
woke
up
to
it
for
a
moment
and
raising
her
drooping
head
watched
her
sister
make
her
way
with
her
handkerchief
in
her
hand
and
the
broad
white
bands
of
her
cap
streaming
over
her
shoulders
to
the
door
susan
stole
a
glance
round
before
she
disappeared
to
catch
the
startled
glance
of
that
resolute
little
face
only
half
woke
up
but
wholly
determined
though
mrs
fred
dared
not
say
another
word
at
that
moment
she
disappeared
full
of
the
conviction
that
her
arrow
had
told
and
that
the
endless
persistence
with
which
she
herself
a
woman
and
a
fool
was
gifted
need
only
be
duly
exercised
to
win
the
day
when
susan
was
gone
that
parting
arrow
did
quiver
for
a
moment
in
nettie
heart
but
the
brave
little
girl
had
for
that
one
night
a
protection
which
her
sister
wist
not
of
after
the
door
closed
nettie
fell
back
once
more
into
that
hour
of
existence
which
expanded
and
opened
out
the
more
for
every
new
approach
which
memory
made
to
it
sweet
nature
gentle
youth
and
the
magician
greater
than
either
came
round
her
in
a
potent
circle
and
defended
nettie
the
woman
was
better
off
than
the
man
in
this
hour
of
their
separation
yet
union
he
chafed
at
the
consolation
which
was
but
visionary
she
perhaps
in
that
visionary
ineffable
solacement
found
a
happiness
greater
than
any
reality
could
ever
give
chapter
xiii
it
was
some
months
after
the
time
of
this
conversation
when
a
man
unlike
the
usual
aspect
of
man
in
carlingford
appeared
at
the
inn
with
a
and
asked
his
way
to
st
roque
cottage
beards
were
not
common
in
those
days
nobody
grew
one
in
carlingford
except
mr
lake
who
in
his
joint
capacity
of
and
represented
the
erratic
and
lawless
followers
of
art
to
the
imagination
of
the
respectable
town
but
the
stranger
who
made
his
sudden
appearance
at
the
blue
boar
wore
such
a
forest
of
hair
on
the
lower
part
of
his
burly
countenance
as
obliterated
all
ordinary
landmarks
in
that
region
and
by
comparison
made
mr
lake
dainty
little
mustache
and
sink
into
utter
propriety
and
respectableness
the
rest
of
the
figure
corresponded
with
this
luxuriant
feature
the
man
was
large
and
burly
a
trifle
too
stout
for
a
perfect
athlete
but
powerful
and
vigorous
almost
beyond
anything
then
known
in
carlingford
it
was
now
summer
and
warm
weather
and
the
dress
of
the
was
as
unusual
as
the
other
particulars
of
his
appearance
in
his
broad
and
linen
coat
he
stood
cool
and
large
in
the
shady
hall
of
the
blue
boar
with
glimpses
of
white
english
linen
appearing
under
his
forest
of
beard
and
round
his
brown
wrists
a
very
small
stretch
of
imagination
was
necessary
to
thrust
pistols
into
his
belt
and
a
cutlass
into
his
hand
and
reveal
him
as
the
of
a
disturbed
country
equally
ready
to
work
or
to
fight
and
more
at
home
in
the
shifts
and
expedients
of
the
wilderness
than
among
the
bonds
of
civilisation
yet
always
retaining
as
english
adventurers
will
certain
dainty
personal
particulars
such
for
instance
as
that
prejudice
in
favour
of
clean
linen
which
only
the
highest
civilisation
can
cultivate
into
perfection
he
went
off
down
grange
lane
with
the
swing
and
poise
of
a
hercules
when
the
admiring
waiters
directed
him
to
the
cottage
miss
wodehouse
who
was
standing
at
the
door
with
lucy
in
the
long
grey
cloak
and
close
bonnet
lately
adopted
by
the
sisterhood
of
mercy
which
had
timidly
under
the
auspices
of
the
perpetual
curate
set
itself
at
st
roque
looked
after
the
savage
man
with
an
instinct
of
gentle
curiosity
wondering
where
he
was
going
and
where
he
came
from
to
tell
the
truth
that
soul
could
with
more
comfort
to
herself
have
stepped
down
a
little
on
the
road
to
st
roque
and
watched
whether
that
extraordinary
figure
was
in
search
of
nettie
a
suspicion
which
immediately
occurred
to
her
than
she
could
set
out
upon
the
to
which
lucy
now
led
her
forth
but
miss
wodehouse
had
tremulously
taken
example
by
the
late
rector
whose
abrupt
retirement
from
the
duties
for
which
he
did
not
feel
himself
qualified
the
good
people
in
carlingford
had
scarcely
stopped
discussing
miss
wodehouse
deeply
impressed
in
her
gentle
mind
by
the
incidents
of
that
time
had
considered
it
her
duty
to
reclaim
if
possible
she
who
had
no
circle
of
college
dons
to
retire
into
her
own
life
from
its
habits
of
quiet
indolence
she
consented
to
go
with
lucy
into
all
the
charitable
affairs
of
carlingford
she
stood
silent
with
a
pitying
face
and
believed
in
all
the
pretences
of
beggary
which
lucy
saw
through
by
natural
insight
but
it
was
no
more
her
natural
element
than
the
long
grey
cloak
was
a
natural
garment
for
that
spotless
woman
her
eyes
turned
wistfully
after
the
stranger
with
suppressed
impulses
of
gentle
curiosity
and
gossip
she
knew
very
well
he
did
not
belong
to
carlingford
she
knew
nobody
in
grange
lane
or
the
neighbourhood
to
whom
he
could
belong
she
wanted
very
much
to
stop
and
inquire
at
the
of
the
blue
boar
their
own
gardener
son
who
and
what
this
was
and
turned
back
to
look
after
him
before
she
turned
out
of
george
street
following
lucy
with
lively
anxiety
to
know
whether
he
was
going
to
st
roque
perhaps
the
labours
of
a
sisterhood
of
mercy
require
a
special
organisation
even
of
the
kind
female
soul
miss
wodehouse
the
most
of
human
creatures
did
not
rise
to
that
development
and
with
a
little
pang
of
unsatisfied
wonder
saw
the
unaccustomed
hercules
disappear
in
the
distance
without
being
able
to
make
out
whither
he
was
bound
nobody
however
who
had
been
privileged
to
share
the
advantages
of
mrs
fred
rider
conversation
for
some
time
back
could
be
at
a
loss
to
guess
who
this
messenger
from
the
wilderness
was
it
was
richard
chatham
come
at
last
he
with
whose
name
nettie
had
been
bored
and
punctured
through
and
through
from
the
first
day
of
his
introduction
into
susan
talk
till
now
mrs
fred
had
used
largely
in
the
interval
that
torture
of
the
continual
dropping
used
it
so
perpetually
as
though
without
producing
any
visible
effect
upon
nettie
resolution
to
introduce
often
a
certain
sickness
and
disgust
with
everything
into
that
steadfast
soul
nor
did
she
content
herself
with
her
own
exertions
but
skilfully
managed
to
introduce
the
idea
into
the
minds
of
the
children
ready
as
all
children
are
for
change
and
novelty
nettie
had
led
a
hard
enough
life
for
these
three
months
she
could
not
meet
edward
rider
nor
he
her
with
a
calm
pretence
of
friendship
and
susan
always
insolent
and
spiteful
and
now
mistress
of
the
position
filled
the
doctor
with
an
amount
of
angry
irritation
which
his
longings
for
nettie
society
could
not
quite
subdue
that
perpetual
barrier
between
them
dismayed
both
meetings
which
always
ended
in
pain
were
best
avoided
except
at
those
intervals
when
longing
love
could
not
even
under
that
penalty
refuse
itself
the
gratification
but
the
dismal
life
which
was
lighted
up
only
by
those
unfrequent
agitating
exasperating
encounters
and
which
flowed
on
through
a
hundred
petty
toilsome
duties
to
the
fretful
accompaniment
of
susan
iterations
and
the
novel
persecution
now
carried
on
by
the
children
was
naturally
irksome
to
the
and
impatient
nature
which
now
no
longer
or
did
not
find
it
so
easy
to
carry
its
own
way
triumphantly
through
those
heavy
clogs
of
helplessness
and
folly
in
the
days
when
miss
wodehouse
pitied
and
wondered
nettie
had
required
no
sympathy
she
had
carried
on
her
course
victorious
more
entirely
conscious
of
the
supreme
gratification
of
having
her
own
way
than
of
the
utter
which
she
made
to
fred
and
his
family
but
now
the
time
predicted
by
miss
wodehouse
had
arrived
nettie
own
personal
happiness
had
come
to
be
at
stake
and
had
been
unhesitatingly
given
up
but
the
knowledge
of
that
renunciation
dwelt
with
nettie
not
all
the
natural
generosity
of
her
mind
not
that
still
stronger
argument
which
she
used
so
often
the
mere
necessity
and
inevitableness
of
the
case
could
blind
her
eyes
to
the
fact
that
she
given
up
her
own
happiness
and
bitter
flashes
of
thought
would
intervene
notwithstanding
even
the
and
reproach
with
which
she
became
aware
of
them
that
doubtful
complicated
matter
most
hard
and
difficult
of
mortal
problems
pressed
hard
upon
nettie
mind
and
heart
in
former
days
when
she
scornfully
denied
it
to
be
and
laboured
on
always
indomitable
unconscious
that
what
she
did
was
anything
more
than
the
simplest
duty
and
necessity
all
was
well
with
the
dauntless
soul
but
growing
knowledge
of
her
own
heart
of
other
hearts
cast
dark
and
perplexing
shades
upon
nettie
as
upon
all
other
wayfarers
in
these
complex
paths
the
effect
upon
her
mind
was
different
from
the
effect
to
be
expected
according
to
modern
sentimental
ethics
nettie
had
never
doubted
of
the
true
duty
the
true
necessity
of
her
position
till
she
became
conscious
of
her
vast
sacrifice
then
a
hundred
doubts
appalled
her
was
she
so
entirely
as
she
had
supposed
was
it
best
to
relieve
the
helpless
hands
of
fred
and
susan
of
their
natural
duties
and
bear
these
burdens
for
them
and
disable
herself
when
her
time
came
from
the
nobler
natural
yoke
in
which
her
full
womanly
influence
might
have
told
to
an
extent
impossible
to
it
now
these
questions
made
nettie
head
which
knew
no
fanciful
pangs
ache
with
painful
thought
and
confused
her
heart
and
dimmed
her
lights
when
she
most
needed
them
to
burn
brightly
while
at
the
very
time
when
these
doubts
assailed
her
her
sister
repetitions
and
the
rising
discontent
and
agitations
of
the
children
came
in
to
the
whole
business
in
a
mist
of
sick
impatience
and
disgust
return
to
australia
was
never
out
of
mind
never
absent
from
her
pertinacious
foolish
lips
little
freddy
harped
upon
it
all
day
long
and
so
did
his
brother
and
sister
nettie
said
nothing
but
retired
with
exasperated
weariness
upon
her
own
thoughts
sometimes
thinking
tired
of
the
conflict
why
not
give
in
to
them
why
not
complete
the
offering
and
remove
once
for
all
into
the
region
of
impossibility
that
contradictory
longing
for
another
life
that
still
stirred
by
times
in
her
heart
she
had
never
given
expression
to
this
weary
inclination
to
make
an
end
of
it
which
sometimes
assailed
her
fatigued
soul
but
this
was
the
condition
in
which
richard
visit
found
her
when
that
bushman
breathing
of
the
wilds
and
the
winds
came
down
the
quiet
suburban
road
to
st
roque
and
filling
the
whole
little
parlour
with
his
beard
and
his
presence
came
stumbling
into
the
confined
room
where
mrs
fred
still
lay
on
the
sofa
and
nettie
pursued
her
endless
work
sorry
to
hear
of
the
poor
doctor
accident
said
the
australian
to
whom
fred
bore
that
title
but
he
always
was
a
bit
of
a
rover
though
it
sad
when
it
comes
to
that
and
so
you
are
thinking
of
a
return
to
the
old
colony
ca
do
better
should
say
there
ai
room
in
this
blessed
old
country
for
anything
but
and
gossips
i
ca
find
enough
air
to
breathe
for
my
part
and
what
there
is
is
taxed
leastways
the
light
is
which
is
all
the
same
well
mrs
rider
say
the
word
and
i
at
your
disposal
i
not
particular
for
a
month
or
two
so
as
i
get
home
before
next
summer
and
if
you
only
tell
me
your
time
i
make
mine
suit
and
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
all
miss
nettie
afraid
of
the
voyage
is
she
that
a
new
line
for
her
i
believe
something
taken
her
fancy
in
this
horrid
old
box
of
a
place
eh
ha
ha
but
i
be
and
courier
to
the
party
miss
nettie
if
you
trust
yourselves
to
me
we
do
mean
to
go
back
thank
you
said
nettie
it
is
only
a
fancy
of
susan
nobody
ever
dreamt
of
going
back
it
is
much
too
expensive
and
troublesome
to
be
done
so
easily
now
we
are
here
we
mean
to
stay
the
bushman
looked
a
little
startled
and
his
lips
formed
into
a
whistle
of
astonishment
which
nettie
resolute
little
face
kept
inaudible
taken
your
fancy
very
much
eh
miss
nettie
said
the
jocular
savage
who
fancied
raillery
of
one
kind
or
other
the
proper
style
of
conversation
to
address
to
a
young
lady
nettie
gave
that
big
hero
a
flashing
sudden
glance
which
silenced
him
mr
chatham
once
more
formed
an
inaudible
whew
with
his
lips
and
looked
at
mrs
fred
but
heart
inclines
to
the
old
colony
miss
susan
i
beg
your
pardon
did
remember
what
i
was
saying
at
that
moment
somehow
you
look
so
much
as
you
used
to
do
barring
the
cap
said
the
australian
that
one
forgets
all
that
has
happened
you
incline
to
cross
the
seas
again
mrs
rider
without
thinking
of
the
expense
and
very
sensible
too
there
never
was
a
place
like
this
blessed
old
country
for
swallowing
up
a
man
money
you
save
as
much
in
a
year
in
the
colony
as
will
take
you
across
that
is
what
i
always
say
but
of
course
my
wishes
are
little
thought
of
said
mrs
fred
with
a
sigh
of
course
it
nettie
we
have
to
look
to
now
if
she
does
not
choose
to
be
sure
it
does
not
matter
what
i
wish
ah
if
i
do
look
different
i
feel
different
things
are
changed
the
bushman
gave
a
puzzled
glance
first
at
one
sister
and
then
at
the
other
it
occurred
to
him
that
fred
had
not
been
so
much
of
a
strength
and
protection
to
his
family
as
this
speech
implied
and
that
nettie
had
been
the
person
whom
mrs
rider
had
to
look
to
even
before
they
left
that
colony
for
which
she
now
sighed
but
mrs
fred
in
her
sorrow
and
her
white
cap
was
an
interesting
figure
to
the
eyes
which
were
not
much
accustomed
to
look
upon
womankind
he
had
no
doubt
hers
was
a
hard
case
nettie
sat
opposite
very
busy
silent
and
resolute
flashing
dangerous
sudden
glances
occasionally
at
her
languid
sister
and
their
big
visitor
it
was
confusing
to
meet
those
brilliant
impatient
wrathful
eyes
though
they
were
wonderfully
bright
they
put
out
the
wild
man
of
the
woods
and
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
he
turned
with
relief
to
those
milder
orbs
which
mrs
fred
buried
in
her
handkerchief
poor
little
oppressed
woman
dependent
upon
that
little
arbitrary
sister
the
sincerest
pity
awoke
in
the
bushman
heart
well
he
said
i
hope
you
come
to
be
of
one
mind
when
miss
nettie
thinks
it
over
again
and
you
have
only
to
drop
me
a
line
to
let
me
know
when
your
plans
are
formed
and
it
will
go
hard
with
me
but
i
make
mine
suit
them
one
way
or
another
all
that
i
can
do
for
you
in
the
way
of
outfit
or
securing
your
passages
or
even
if
you
would
allow
me
here
the
good
fellow
paused
afraid
to
venture
any
further
nettie
looked
up
in
a
sudden
blaze
and
transfixed
him
with
her
eye
we
have
enough
for
everything
we
want
thank
you
said
nettie
looking
through
and
through
his
guilty
benevolent
intentions
and
bringing
a
flush
of
confusion
to
his
honest
cheeks
when
i
say
i
can
not
afford
anything
i
do
mean
to
ask
anybody
assistance
mr
chatham
we
can
do
very
well
by
ourselves
if
it
came
to
be
best
for
the
children
or
if
susan
keeps
on
wishing
it
and
gets
her
own
way
as
she
generally
does
said
nettie
with
heightened
colour
dropping
her
eyes
and
going
on
at
double
speed
with
her
work
i
daresay
we
shall
manage
it
as
we
did
before
but
that
is
my
concern
nobody
in
the
world
has
anything
to
do
with
it
but
me
oh
nettie
dear
you
giving
in
at
last
do
say
you
go
and
mr
chatham
promises
he
take
care
of
us
on
the
way
cried
mrs
fred
clasping
her
hands
they
were
thin
hands
and
looked
delicate
in
contrast
with
her
black
dress
she
was
very
interesting
pathetic
and
tender
to
the
rough
eyes
of
the
bushranger
he
thought
that
imperative
little
creature
opposite
with
her
brilliant
glances
her
small
head
drooping
under
those
heavy
braids
of
hair
her
tiny
figure
and
rapid
fingers
looked
like
a
little
cruel
sprite
oppressing
the
melancholy
soul
when
nettie
rose
from
the
table
goaded
into
sudden
intolerance
by
that
appeal
the
climax
of
the
continual
dropping
and
threw
her
work
indignantly
on
the
table
and
called
freddy
to
come
directly
and
get
dressed
for
his
walk
the
impression
made
by
her
supposed
arbitrary
and
imperious
behaviour
was
not
diminished
she
went
out
disdainful
making
no
reply
and
left
those
two
to
a
private
conference
then
mrs
fred
unbosomed
her
bereaved
heart
to
that
sympathetic
stranger
she
told
him
how
different
everything
was
now
how
hard
it
was
to
be
dependent
even
on
one
sister
how
far
otherwise
things
might
have
been
if
poor
dear
fred
had
been
more
prudent
one
way
or
other
all
her
life
through
susan
had
been
an
injured
woman
all
her
desire
was
to
take
the
children
back
to
the
colony
before
she
died
if
nettie
would
but
yield
sighed
mrs
fred
clasping
her
hands
nettie
must
yield
cried
the
bushranger
full
of
emotion
and
susan
cried
a
little
and
told
him
how
much
the
poor
dear
children
wished
it
and
knew
in
her
fool
heart
that
she
had
driven
nettie
to
the
extremest
bounds
of
patience
and
that
a
little
more
persistence
and
iteration
would
gain
the
day
in
the
mean
time
nettie
went
out
with
freddy
the
other
two
being
at
school
and
took
him
across
the
fields
for
his
afternoon
walk
the
little
fellow
talked
of
australia
all
the
way
with
a
childish
treachery
and
betrayal
of
her
cause
which
went
to
nettie
heart
she
walked
by
his
side
hearing
without
listening
throbbing
all
over
with
secret
disgust
impatience
and
despair
she
too
perceived
well
enough
the
approaching
crisis
she
saw
that
once
more
all
her
own
resolution
the
purpose
of
her
heart
would
be
overborne
by
the
hopeless
pertinacity
of
the
unconvincible
unreasoning
fool
she
did
not
call
her
sister
hard
names
she
recognised
the
quality
without
giving
it
its
appropriate
title
and
recognised
also
with
a
bitterness
of
resistance
yet
a
sense
of
the
inevitable
not
to
be
described
the
certain
issue
of
the
unequal
contest
what
chance
had
the
generous
little
heart
the
hasty
temper
the
quick
and
vivacious
spirit
against
that
unwearying
unreasoning
pertinacity
once
more
she
must
arise
and
go
forth
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
the
sacrifice
must
be
final
now
chapter
xiv
well
it
to
be
hoped
she
going
to
do
well
for
herself
that
all
we
got
to
do
with
it
eh
i
suppose
so
said
mr
wodehouse
nothing
to
you
is
she
but
a
little
girl
you
taken
a
deal
of
notice
of
more
notice
than
was
wanted
if
i
am
any
judge
if
she
does
go
and
marry
this
fellow
from
australia
and
he
willing
to
take
the
whole
bundle
back
to
where
they
came
from
it
is
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
in
opinion
sly
young
dog
that
doctor
though
i
must
say
do
you
think
so
well
that
how
it
appears
to
me
let
see
there
was
bessie
hum
perhaps
it
as
well
in
present
circumstances
to
name
no
names
there
was
in
the
first
instance
you
know
and
the
way
he
got
out
of
that
was
beautiful
it
was
what
i
call
instructive
was
that
and
then
why
then
there
was
miss
marjoribanks
you
know
capital
match
that
just
the
thing
for
young
rider
set
him
up
for
life
papa
pray
do
talk
nonsense
said
miss
wodehouse
with
gentle
indignation
miss
marjoribanks
is
at
least
ten
years
oh
stuff
keep
your
memory
to
yourself
molly
who
cares
for
a
dozen
years
or
so
has
she
all
the
old
scotchman
practice
and
his
savings
and
a
fine
woman
yet
a
fine
woman
eh
well
yes
i
think
so
and
then
here
this
little
wretch
of
a
why
the
doctor
taken
your
wentworth
eh
well
i
suppose
what
ought
to
be
your
you
know
though
i
seen
you
casting
glances
at
the
strange
little
creature
yourself
indeed
i
assure
you
you
are
entirely
mistaken
said
mr
wentworth
hastily
with
a
sudden
flush
of
either
indignation
or
guilt
the
curate
glanced
at
lucy
wodehouse
who
was
walking
demurely
by
his
side
but
who
certainly
did
prick
up
her
ears
at
this
little
bit
of
news
she
saw
very
well
that
he
had
looked
at
her
but
would
take
no
notice
of
his
glance
but
lucy
curiosity
was
notably
quickened
notwithstanding
st
roque
cottage
was
wonderfully
handy
if
the
perpetual
curate
of
the
pretty
suburban
church
saw
anything
worth
visiting
there
lucy
drew
up
her
pretty
shoulders
in
her
grey
cloak
and
opened
her
blue
eyes
a
little
wider
she
was
still
in
circumstances
to
defy
her
reverend
lover
if
his
eyes
had
declined
upon
lower
attractions
than
her
own
she
looked
very
straight
before
her
with
unpitying
precision
down
the
road
on
which
st
roque
church
and
cottage
were
becoming
already
visible
the
whole
party
were
walking
briskly
over
a
path
hard
with
frost
which
made
their
footsteps
ring
the
air
was
still
with
a
winterly
touch
benumbed
with
cold
yet
every
sound
rang
sharply
through
that
clear
cloudless
atmosphere
reddened
without
being
warmed
by
the
sun
as
it
approached
the
west
it
was
christmas
again
and
they
were
wending
their
way
towards
st
roque
to
assist
at
the
holiday
decorations
for
which
cartloads
of
laurel
and
holly
had
been
already
deposited
within
the
church
lucy
wodehouse
was
chief
directress
of
these
important
operations
her
sister
had
accompanied
her
partly
to
admire
work
and
partly
to
call
at
the
cottage
and
see
how
nettie
was
going
on
mr
wodehouse
himself
had
come
merely
for
the
pride
and
pleasure
of
seeing
how
much
they
were
indebted
to
his
little
girl
and
the
attendance
of
the
curate
was
most
easily
explainable
it
was
indeed
astonishing
how
many
extremely
necessary
and
natural
calls
of
duty
should
bring
mr
wentworth
path
parallel
to
that
of
the
wodehouses
this
is
why
they
were
all
proceeding
together
on
this
particular
afternoon
in
the
week
before
christmas
towards
st
roque
in
the
church
when
the
party
arrived
a
little
group
of
workers
were
busy
the
chancel
arch
was
already
bristling
with
glossy
at
a
little
distance
from
the
active
group
occupied
with
this
pleasant
work
and
full
of
chatter
and
consultation
as
was
natural
stood
one
little
figure
pointing
out
to
two
children
the
wonders
of
that
decorative
art
every
one
of
the
except
mr
wodehouse
recognised
nettie
before
she
was
aware
of
their
presence
she
stood
with
her
bonnet
fallen
a
little
back
as
it
generally
was
either
by
encounter
of
the
wind
or
by
the
quantity
and
luxuriance
of
her
beautiful
hair
looking
upwards
to
the
point
where
she
had
directed
the
children
eyes
she
looked
a
little
forlorn
and
solitary
as
was
natural
all
by
herself
so
near
that
group
of
busy
girls
in
the
chancel
so
little
separated
from
them
by
age
so
entirely
divided
by
circumstances
if
a
certain
softening
of
pity
shone
in
the
curate
eye
could
lucy
wodehouse
blame
him
but
the
fact
was
lucy
swept
past
the
little
australian
with
a
very
brief
salutation
and
burst
into
sudden
criticism
of
the
work
that
had
been
done
in
her
absence
which
startled
her
collaborateurs
while
mr
wentworth
followed
her
into
the
chancel
with
a
meekness
quite
unusual
to
that
young
priest
nettie
noted
both
circumstances
with
a
little
surprise
but
not
connecting
them
in
the
most
distant
degree
with
herself
turned
round
with
a
little
twitch
of
freddy
arm
to
go
away
and
in
doing
so
almost
walked
into
the
arms
of
her
older
and
more
faithful
friend
miss
wodehouse
kissed
her
quite
suddenly
touching
with
her
soft
old
cheek
that
rounder
fairer
youthful
face
which
turned
half
wondering
half
pleased
with
the
look
of
a
child
to
receive
her
caress
nettie
was
as
unconscious
that
miss
wodehouse
unusual
warmth
was
meant
to
make
up
for
lucy
careless
greeting
as
that
lucy
had
passed
her
with
a
positive
flutter
of
resentment
and
indignation
and
that
she
had
been
the
subject
of
the
conversation
and
thoughts
of
all
the
party
miss
wodehouse
turned
with
her
taking
freddy
other
hand
a
proceeding
to
which
that
hero
rather
demurred
they
went
out
together
to
the
frosty
road
where
the
bare
rustled
between
the
church
and
the
cottage
when
they
reached
the
porch
of
st
roque
nettie
instinctively
held
her
breath
and
stood
still
for
a
moment
along
the
footpath
in
front
of
them
a
big
figure
was
passing
and
beyond
that
bearded
shadow
the
doctor
drag
flew
past
with
all
the
separate
tones
of
the
horse
feet
the
wheels
the
jingle
of
the
harness
ringing
clear
through
the
sharp
unsoftened
medium
of
that
frosty
atmosphere
the
doctor
himself
had
all
his
attention
concentrated
upon
the
windows
of
the
cottage
in
which
the
sun
was
blazing
red
he
did
not
see
nettie
in
the
church
porch
he
was
looking
for
her
too
intently
in
the
crimsoned
windows
to
which
he
turned
his
head
back
as
he
dashed
on
unawares
nettie
clasped
the
fingers
of
her
little
companion
tighter
in
her
hand
as
she
watched
that
unexpected
homage
the
drag
was
out
of
sight
in
another
moment
and
in
a
few
seconds
more
the
bell
of
the
cottage
pealed
audibly
and
the
door
was
heard
to
open
admitting
the
bushman
who
had
come
upon
one
of
his
frequent
visits
that
last
sound
disturbed
composure
and
at
the
same
time
brought
her
back
to
herself
i
can
not
ask
you
to
go
in
for
mr
chatham
is
there
and
susan
of
course
talking
to
him
said
nettie
with
a
quiet
breath
of
restrained
impatience
but
i
should
like
to

asked
the
little
girl
gazing
coldly
in
miss
wodehouse
face
when
nettie
went
out
to
tea
we
made
as
much
noise
as
we

freddy

tea
we
never
have
any
tea
till
nettie
comes
back
added
his
sister
looking
full
once
more
into
miss
wodehouse
face
the
calm
childish
impertinence
disconcerted
that
gentle
woman
she
gazed
at
the
wonderful
creatures
with
dumb
amazement
her
eyes
fell
before
their
steady
stare
i
should
be
sorry
to
bring
you
out
again
dear
if
it
a
trouble
began
miss
wodehouse
turning
her
face
with
a
sense
of
relief
from
the
hard
inspection
of
the
children
to
their
little
guardian
nettie
made
no
reply
but
carried
off
her
children
to
the
cottage
door
turned
them
peremptorily
in
and
issued
her
last
orders
if
you
make
a
noise
you
shall
not
go
said
nettie
and
then
came
back
alert
with
her
rapid
fairy
steps
to
miss
wodehouse
side
does
not
their
mother
take
any
charge
of
them
faltered
the
gentle
inquisitor
i
never
can
understand
you
young
people
nettie
things
were
different
in
my
days
do
you
think
it
quite
the
best
thing
to
do
other
people
duties
for
them
dear
and
now
i
so
sorry
oh
so
sorry
to
hear
what
you
are
going
to
do
now
susan
is
delicate
said
nettie
she
never
had
any
health
to
speak
of
i
mean
she
always
got
better
you
know
but
never
had
any
pleasure
in
it
there
must
be
a
great
deal
in
that
continued
nettie
reflectively
it
never
comes
into
my
head
to
think
whether
i
am
ill
or
well
but
poor
susan
has
always
had
to
be
thinking
of
it
yes
i
shall
have
to
take
them
away
she
added
again
after
a
pause
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
too
miss
wodehouse
i
did
not
think
at
one
time
that
i
had
the
heart
to
do
it
but
on
the
whole
you
know
it
seems
so
much
better
for
them
susan
will
be
stronger
out
there
and
i
have
not
money
enough
to
give
the
children
a
very
good
education
they
will
just
have
to
push
their
way
like
the
others
and
in
the
colony
you
know
things
are
so
different
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
now
that
it
will
be
best
for
them
all
but
nettie
nettie
what
of
yourself
will
it
be
best
for
you
cried
miss
wodehouse
looking
earnestly
in
her
face
what
is
best
for
them
will
be
best
for
me
said
nettie
with
a
little
impatient
movement
of
her
head
she
said
so
with
unfaltering
spirit
and
promptitude
she
had
come
to
be
impatient
of
the
dreary
maze
in
which
she
was
involved
if
one
must
break
one
heart
it
is
best
to
do
it
at
once
and
have
done
with
it
said
nettie
under
her
breath
what
was
that
you
said
about
your
heart
said
miss
wodehouse
ah
my
dear
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
speak
of
you
are
going
to
be
married
nettie
and
i
wanted
to
suggest
to
you
if
you
wo
be
angry
do
you
think
you
could
make
some
arrangement
about
your
sister
and
her
family
dear
not
to
say
a
word
against
the
australian
gentleman
nettie
whom
of
course
i
do
know
a
man
may
be
the
best
of
husbands
and
yet
not
be
able
to
put
up
with
a
whole
family
i
have
no
doubt
the
children
are
very
nice
clever
children
but
their
manner
is
odd
you
know
for
such
young
creatures
you
have
been
sacrificing
yourself
for
them
all
this
time
but
remember
what
i
say
if
you
want
to
live
happily
my
dear
you
have
to
sacrifice
them
to
your
husband
i
could
not
be
content
without
saying
as
much
to
you
nettie
i
never
was
half
the
good
in
this
world
that
you
are
but
i
am
nearly
twice
as
old
and
one
does
pick
up
some
little
hints
on
the
way
that
is
what
you
must
do
nettie
make
some
arrangement
dear
if
he
has
promised
to
take
them
out
with
you
that
is
all
right
enough
but
when
you
come
to
settle
down
in
your
new
home
make
some
arrangement
dear
when
miss
wodehouse
arrived
breathless
at
the
conclusion
of
a
speech
so
unusually
long
for
her
she
met
nettie
eyes
flashing
upon
her
with
the
utmost
surprise
and
curiosity
i
shall
never
marry
anybody
said
nettie
what
do
you
mean
do
say
anything
so
foolish
said
miss
wodehouse
a
little
nettled
do
you
suppose
i
do
know
and
see
mr
chatham
coming
and
going
how
often
has
he
been
seen
since
the
first
time
nettie
and
do
you
suppose
it
all
been
benevolence
my
dear
i
know
better
nettie
looked
up
with
a
startled
glance
she
did
not
blush
nor
betray
any
pleasant
consciousness
she
cast
one
dismayed
look
back
towards
the
cottage
and
another
at
miss
wodehouse
can
be
why
he
comes
said
nettie
with
quiet
horror
indeed
i
never
thought
of
it
before
but
all
the
same
i
shall
never
marry
anybody
do
you
imagine
cried
the
brilliant
creature
flashing
round
upon
poor
miss
wodehouse
so
as
to
dazzle
and
confuse
that
gentlewoman
that
a
man
has
only
to
intend
such
a
thing
and
it
all
settled
i
think
differently
twenty
thousand
chathams
would
not
move
me
i
shall
never
marry
anybody
if
i
live
to
be
as
old
as
as
you
or
methuselah
or
anybody
it
is
not
my
lot
i
shall
take
the
children
out
to
australia
and
do
the
best
i
can
for
them
three
children
want
a
great
deal
of
looking
after
and
after
a
while
in
carlingford
you
will
all
forget
that
there
ever
was
such
a
creature
as
nettie
no
i
am
not
crying
i
never
cry
i
should
scorn
to
cry
about
it
it
is
simply
that
is
what
it
is
one
is
sorry
of
course
and
now
and
then
it
feels
hard
and
all
that
but
what
did
one
come
into
the
world
for
i
should
like
to
know
does
anybody
suppose
it
was
just
to
be
comfortable
and
have
one
own
way
i
have
had
my
own
way
a
great
deal
more
than
most
people
if
i
get
crossed
in
some
things
i
have
to
bear
it
that
is
all
i
am
going
to
say
i
have
got
other
things
to
do
miss
wodehouse
i
shall
never
marry
anybody
all
my
life
my
dear
if
you
are
thrown
upon
this
mr
chatham
for
society
all
the
time
of
the
voyage
and
have
nobody
else
to
talk
to
said
the
prudent
interlocutor
then
we
go
in
another
ship
cried
nettie
promptly
that
is
easily
managed
i
know
what
it
is
a
long
voyage
with
three
children
they
fall
up
the
and
they
fall
down
the
forecastle
and
they
give
you
twenty
frights
in
a
day
that
they
will
drop
overboard
one
does
not
have
much
leisure
for
anything
not
even
for
thinking
which
is
a
comfort
sometimes
added
nettie
confidentially
to
herself
it
depends
upon
what
you
think
of
whether
thinking
is
a
comfort
or
not
said
good
miss
wodehouse
when
i
think
of
you
young
people
and
all
the
perplexities
you
get
into
there
is
lucy
now
vexed
with
mr
wentworth
about
something
oh
nothing
worth
mentioning
and
there
was
poor
dr
rider
how
he
did
look
behind
him
to
be
sure
as
he
went
past
st
roque
i
daresay
it
was
you
he
was
looking
for
nettie
i
wish
you
and
he
could
have
fancied
each
other
and
come
to
some
arrangement
about
poor
mr
fred
family
to
give
them
so
much
to
live
on
or
something
i
assure
you
when
i
begin
to
think
over
such
things
and
how
perverse
both
people
and
circumstances
are
thinking
is
very
little
comfort
to
me
miss
wodehouse
drew
a
long
sigh
and
was
by
no
means
disinclined
to
cry
over
her
little
companion
though
she
was
the
taller
of
the
two
she
leant
upon
nettie
firm
little
fairy
arm
as
they
went
up
the
quiet
road
already
the
rapid
winter
twilight
had
fallen
and
before
them
in
the
distance
glimmered
the
lights
of
carlingford
foremost
among
which
shone
conspicuous
the
large
placid
white
lamp
for
professional
reds
and
blues
were
beneath
his
dignity
which
mounted
guard
at
dr
garden
gate
those
lights
beginning
to
shine
through
the
evening
darkness
gave
a
wonderful
look
of
home
to
the
place
instinctively
there
occurred
to
nettie
mind
a
vision
of
how
it
would
be
on
the
sea
with
a
wide
dark
ocean
heaving
around
the
solitary
speck
on
its
breast
it
did
not
matter
if
a
silent
sob
arose
in
her
heart
it
found
no
utterance
might
not
edward
rider
have
made
that
suggestion
which
had
occurred
only
to
miss
wodehouse
why
did
it
never
come
into
his
head
that
susan
and
her
family
might
have
a
provision
supplied
for
them
which
would
relieve
nettie
he
had
not
thought
of
it
that
was
all
instead
of
that
he
had
accepted
the
impossibility
nettie
heart
had
grown
impatient
in
the
maze
of
she
turned
her
back
upon
the
lights
and
clasped
miss
wodehouse
hand
and
said
hastily
she
went
on
by
herself
very
rapidly
along
the
hard
gleaming
road
she
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
her
friend
protestation
that
she
too
was
coming
back
again
to
st
roque
to
join
lucy
on
the
contrary
nettie
peremptorily
left
miss
wodehouse
shaking
hands
with
her
in
so
resolute
a
manner
that
her
gentle
adviser
felt
somehow
a
kind
of
necessity
upon
her
to
pursue
her
way
home
and
only
when
nettie
was
nearly
out
of
sight
turned
again
with
hesitation
to
retrace
her
steps
towards
st
roque
nettie
meanwhile
went
on
at
a
pace
which
miss
wodehouse
could
not
possibly
have
kept
up
with
clasping
her
tiny
hands
together
with
a
swell
of
scorn
and
disdain
unusual
to
it
in
her
heart
yes
why
did
not
edward
rider
propose
the
arrangement
which
appeared
feasible
enough
to
miss
wodehouse
supposing
even
nettie
had
refused
to
consent
to
it
as
she
might
very
probably
have
done
with
indignation
still
why
did
it
not
occur
to
dr
edward
she
asked
herself
the
question
with
a
heat
and
passion
which
she
found
it
difficult
to
account
for
she
half
despised
her
lover
as
woman
will
for
obeying
her
almost
scorned
him
as
woman
will
for
the
mere
constancy
which
took
no
violent
measures
but
only
suffered
and
accepted
the
inevitable
to
submit
to
what
can
not
be
helped
is
a
woman
part
nettie
hastening
along
that
familiar
path
blazed
into
a
sudden
burst
of
rage
against
edward
because
he
submitted
what
he
could
do
else
she
was
as
ignorant
of
as
any
unreasonable
creature
could
be
but
that
mattered
little
with
indignation
she
saw
herself
standing
on
the
verge
of
that
domestic
precipice
and
the
doctor
looking
on
seeing
her
glide
out
of
his
reach
yet
putting
forth
no
violent
sudden
hand
to
detain
her
all
the
impatience
of
her
fiery
nature
boiled
in
her
veins
as
she
hasted
to
the
cottage
where
susan
was
discussing
their
journey
with
her
australian
visitor
no
remnant
of
pathos
or
remained
about
nettie
as
she
flashed
in
upon
them
in
all
her
old
haste
and
resolute
to
precipitate
the
catastrophe
which
nobody
took
any
measures
to
prevent
chapter
xv
it
was
not
long
before
the
doctor
was
made
aware
of
the
ghost
in
his
troubled
path
nobody
in
carlingford
could
meet
the
big
bushman
in
those
streets
which
always
looked
too
narrow
for
him
without
a
certain
curiosity
about
that
savage
man
dr
rider
had
observed
him
with
jealous
interest
on
his
very
first
appearance
but
had
hitherto
connected
no
idea
but
that
of
a
return
to
australia
which
he
felt
sure
nettie
would
never
consent
to
with
the
big
stranger
with
such
a
thought
he
had
seen
him
making
his
way
towards
the
cottage
that
very
evening
when
he
himself
turned
back
as
long
as
those
crimsoned
windows
were
visible
to
look
for
nettie
who
did
not
show
herself
the
doctor
was
bound
to
see
a
distant
patient
miles
on
the
other
side
of
carlingford
as
he
dashed
along
over
the
echoing
road
he
had
time
to
imagine
to
himself
how
nettie
might
at
that
very
moment
be
badgered
and
persecuted
and
when
he
had
seen
his
patient
and
done
his
duty
and
with
the
lamps
lighted
in
the
drag
and
the
frosty
wind
blowing
keen
on
his
face
and
the
lights
of
carlingford
cheering
him
on
in
the
distance
was
once
more
returning
an
impatience
somewhat
akin
to
nettie
suddenly
came
upon
the
doctor
akin
yet
different
for
in
his
case
it
was
an
impulse
of
sensation
an
inspiration
of
the
exhilarating
speed
and
energy
of
motion
with
which
he
flew
through
the
bracing
air
master
of
himself
his
horse
and
the
long
sweep
of
solitary
road
before
him
again
it
occurred
to
dr
rider
to
dash
forward
to
st
roque
and
carry
off
nettie
oppose
it
who
would
the
idea
pleased
him
as
he
swept
along
in
the
darkness
its
very
impossibility
making
the
vision
sweeter
to
carry
her
off
at
a
stroke
in
glorious
defiance
of
circumstances
and
win
happiness
and
love
whatever
might
ensue
in
the
flush
of
the
moment
the
doctor
suddenly
asked
himself
whether
this
after
all
were
not
the
wisest
course
whether
whatever
might
come
of
it
happiness
was
not
worth
the
encounter
of
the
dark
array
of
troubles
behind
and
whether
to
precipitate
everything
by
a
sudden
conclusion
might
not
be
the
best
way
of
solving
all
the
intricacies
of
the
matter
he
was
still
in
this
mood
when
he
arrived
at
his
own
house
where
dinner
as
usual
was
not
improved
by
having
been
ready
for
an
hour
the
lamp
was
not
lighted
when
he
came
in
and
only
the
cold
reflection
of
the
street
lights
outside
with
a
particoloured
gleam
at
the
corner
window
from
his
own
red
and
blue
professional
ensign
at
the
surgery
door
lighted
the
solitary
little
room
where
he
looked
in
vain
even
for
so
much
as
a
note
or
letter
to
bring
some
shadow
of
human
fellowship
to
his
home
the
fire
smouldering
dully
the
big
chair
turned
with
a
sullen
back
against
the
wall
as
if
nobody
ever
sat
there
though
nettie
had
once
and
for
ever
appropriated
it
to
her
use
everything
in
such
inhuman
trim
and
good
order
disgusted
the
doctor
he
rang
his
bell
violently
for
the
lights
and
refreshments
which
were
so
slow
of
coming
and
throwing
himself
into
that
chair
bit
his
nails
and
stared
out
at
the
lamplight
in
the
rapid
access
of
thought
that
came
upon
him
the
first
thing
that
disturbed
him
in
this
was
the
apparition
of
a
figure
outside
peering
in
with
some
anxiety
at
the
blank
windows
somebody
who
was
evidently
curious
to
know
whether
the
doctor
had
yet
come
home
the
unhappy
doctor
started
and
rang
his
bell
once
more
with
furious
iteration
he
knew
what
was
coming
somebody
else
no
doubt
had
taken
ill
without
any
consideration
for
young
dinner
which
however
a
man
must
manage
to
swallow
even
when
tormented
with
importunate
patients
and
in
love
but
the
knock
of
the
untimely
visitor
sounded
at
the
door
before
mary
sulky
and
resistant
had
been
able
to
arrange
before
the
hungry
doctor
the
viands
which
his
impatience
would
not
permit
to
be
duly
heated
up
and
he
had
just
seated
himself
to
dispose
of
the
unsatisfactory
meal
when
the
little
groom
who
was
as
tired
as
his
master
opened
the
door
for
mrs
smith
from
st
roque
mrs
smith
was
a
familiar
periodical
visitor
at
dr
rider
she
had
not
ceased
to
hold
to
that
hasty
and
unwise
financial
arrangement
into
which
the
doctor
was
persuaded
to
enter
when
fred
pipe
had
exasperated
the
landlady
into
rebellion
he
had
supplemented
the
rent
at
that
exciting
moment
rather
than
have
nettie
disturbed
and
now
that
poor
fred
pipe
was
extinguished
for
ever
the
doctor
still
paid
the
imposition
demanded
from
him
half
because
he
had
no
time
to
contest
it
half
because
it
was
however
improper
and
unnecessary
a
kind
of
pleasure
to
do
something
for
nettie
little
as
she
knew
and
deeply
as
she
would
have
resented
it
dr
rider
brows
cleared
up
at
sight
of
nettie
landlady
he
expected
some
little
private
anecdotes
of
her
and
her
ways
such
as
no
one
else
could
give
him
he
gave
mrs
smith
a
chair
with
a
benignity
to
which
she
had
no
personal
claim
her
arrival
made
dr
rider
beefsteak
palatable
though
the
cookery
and
condition
of
the
same
were
to
say
the
least
far
from
perfect
mrs
smith
evidently
was
a
little
embarrassed
with
the
gracious
reception
she
received
she
twisted
the
corner
of
her
shawl
in
her
fingers
as
if
it
had
been
that
apron
with
which
women
of
her
class
habitually
relieve
their
feelings
she
was
in
a
false
position
she
came
with
the
worst
of
news
to
the
melancholy
lover
and
he
treated
her
as
if
she
brought
some
special
message
or
favour
from
the
lady
of
his
thoughts
well
mrs
smith
and
how
are
you
all
at
the
cottage
said
the
doctor
applying
himself
leisurely
to
his
beefsteak
well
doctor
nothing
to
brag
of
said
mrs
smith
fixing
her
eyes
upon
the
fringe
of
her
shawl
i
have
nothing
to
say
that
pleasant
more
the
pity
i
don
know
sir
how
you
take
it
when
you
come
to
hear
but
it
come
very
hard
upon
me
not
for
the
sake
of
the
lodgings
let
again
fast
enough
now
the
poor
gentleman
sad
fate
is
partly
forgotten
but
you
know
doctor
a
body
gets
when
one
set
of
people
stays
long
enough
to
feel
at
home
and
there
ai
many
young
ladies
like
miss
if
you
were
to
search
the
country
through
but
now
she
really
give
in
to
it
herself
there
ai
no
more
to
be
said
i
never
could
bring
myself
to
think
miss
would
give
in
till
when
she
told
me
though
smith
he
always
said
when
the
stranger
gentleman
took
to
coming
so
constant
as
he
knew
how
it
would
be
for
heaven
sake
what
do
you
mean
cried
dr
rider
pushing
away
his
plate
and
rising
hurriedly
from
that
dinner
which
was
fated
never
to
be
eaten
mrs
smith
shook
her
head
and
drew
out
her
handkerchief
i
know
nothing
more
doctor
but
just
they
going
off
to
australia
said
the
landlady
mournfully
and
miss
has
started
packing
the
big
boxes
as
have
been
in
the
hattic
since
ever
they
come
they
going
off
back
where
they
come
from
that
all
as
i
know
impossible
cried
the
doctor
i
have
said
so
myself
this
morning
said
mrs
smith
but
there
nothing
impossible
doctor
as
miss
takes
in
her
head
do
you
go
and
rush
out
after
her
dr
rider
i
beg
of
you
upon
my
knees
if
it
was
my
last
word
i
said
to
smith
i
come
up
and
tell
the
doctor
that
he
might
hear
from
nobody
promiscuous
as
could
explain
and
come
rushing
down
to
the
cottage
to
know
the
rights
of
it
and
find
the
gentleman
there
unexpected
if
there
one
thing
i
afeard
of
it
a
quarrel
between
gentlemen
in
my
house
so
doctor
for
the
love
of
peace
do
you
go
anear
the
cottage
i
tell
you
everything
if
you
listen
to
me
the
doctor
who
had
snatched
up
his
hat
and
made
a
rapid
step
towards
the
door
came
back
and
seized
hold
of
his
visitor
shoulder
all
his
benignity
having
been
put
to
flight
by
her
revelation
look
here
i
want
the
truth
and
no
gossip
what
do
you
mean
what
gentleman
what
is
it
all
about
cried
dr
rider
hoarse
with
sudden
passion
oh
bless
you
doctor
do
blame
it
upon
me
sir
cried
mrs
smith
it
ai
neither
my
fault
nor
my
business
but
that
you
always
been
kind
and
my
heart
warms
to
miss
it
the
gentleman
from
australia
as
has
come
and
come
again
and
being
an
unmarried
gentleman
and
miss
you
know
what
she
is
sir
and
i
ask
you
candid
dr
rider
what
was
anybody
to
suppose
the
doctor
grew
wildly
red
up
to
his
hair
he
bit
his
lips
over
some
furious
words
which
carlingford
would
have
been
horrified
to
hear
and
grasped
mrs
smith
shoulder
with
a
closer
pressure
what
did
she
tell
you
said
the
doctor
let
me
have
it
word
for
word
did
she
say
she
was
going
away
did
she
speak
of
this
this
fellow
exclaimed
the
doctor
with
an
adjective
over
which
charity
drops
a
tear
ca
you
tell
me
without
any
supposes
what
did
she
say
i
not
the
woman
to
stand
being
shook
let
me
go
this
minute
sir
cried
mrs
smith
the
australian
gentleman
is
a
very
civil
man
as
was
always
very
respectful
to
me
she
came
into
my
doctor
if
you
will
know
so
particular
all
shining
and
flashing
like
as
she
does
when
something
happened
i
do
make
no
doubt
they
had
been
settling
matters
them
two
and
so
i
told
smith
smith
said
miss
in
her
hasty
way
enough
to
catch
your
breath
coming
all
of
a
sudden
ca
stand
this
no
longer
i
shall
have
to
go
away
it
no
good
resisting
them
were
her
very
words
dr
rider
me
out
the
big
boxes
please
said
miss
best
done
quietly
you
must
take
your
week
notice
mrs
smith
from
this
day
and
with
that
she
kept
moving
about
the
room
all
in
a
flutter
like
not
able
to
rest
go
and
get
me
out
those
boxes
there
always
a
ship
on
the
she
says
taking
up
my
knitting
and
falling
to
work
at
it
to
keep
her
hands
steady
day
afore
christmas
says
i
oh
miss
it
running
in
the
face
of
providence
to
sail
at
this
time
of
the
year
you
have
dreadful
weather
as
sure
as
life
you
should
have
seen
her
doctor
she
gave
a
sort
of
smile
up
at
me
all
flashing
as
if
those
eyes
of
her
were
the
sides
of
a
lantern
and
the
light
bursting
out
both
there
and
all
over
the
better
she
says
as
if
she
have
liked
to
fight
the
very
wind
and
sea
and
have
her
own
way
even
there
bless
you
dreadful
for
having
her
own
way
a
good
easy
gentleman
now
as
mind
much
dr
rider
doctor
you
not
agoing
after
all
i
told
you
doctor
doctor
i
say
but
what
mrs
smith
said
was
inaudible
to
edward
rider
the
door
rang
in
her
ears
as
he
dashed
it
after
him
leaving
her
mistress
of
the
field
there
where
he
had
once
left
nettie
he
now
of
his
usual
fastidious
dislike
of
gossip
left
mrs
smith
sole
occupant
of
his
most
private
territories
at
this
crisis
the
doctor
had
neither
a
word
nor
a
moment
to
spend
on
any
one
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
oblivious
of
all
those
professional
necessities
which
limit
the
comings
and
goings
of
a
doctor
in
great
practice
he
did
not
even
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
perhaps
it
was
an
anxious
husband
or
father
whom
he
all
but
upset
as
he
came
out
with
sudden
impetuosity
into
the
unfrequented
street
but
he
did
not
stop
to
see
pale
and
desperate
he
faced
the
cold
wind
which
rushed
up
between
the
blank
of
grange
lane
at
mr
wodehouse
door
he
stumbled
against
young
wentworth
coming
out
and
passed
him
with
a
muttered
exclamation
which
startled
the
curate
all
the
floating
momentary
jealousies
of
the
past
rushed
back
upon
the
doctor
mind
as
he
passed
that
tall
figure
in
the
wintry
road
how
he
had
snatched
nettie
from
the
vague
kindnesses
of
the
young
clergyman
the
words
he
had
addressed
to
her
on
this
very
road
the
answer
she
had
given
him
once
which
had
driven
him
wild
with
passion
and
resentment
impossible
the
australian
it
appeared
had
found
nothing
impossible
in
those
circumstances
in
which
nettie
had
intrenched
herself
had
the
doctor
wisdom
been
monstrous
folly
and
his
prudence
the
blindest
shortsightedness
he
asked
himself
the
question
as
he
rushed
on
towards
that
lighted
window
shining
far
along
the
dark
road
the
same
window
which
he
had
seen
nettie
shadow
cross
which
had
been
opened
to
light
poor
fred
upon
the
way
he
never
could
tread
again
within
that
jealous
blind
shining
in
that
softened
domestic
light
what
drama
murderous
to
the
doctor
peace
might
be
going
on
now
chapter
xvi
nettie
had
taken
her
resolution
all
at
once
breathless
in
sudden
conviction
angry
heated
yet
seeing
in
the
midst
of
her
excitement
no
help
but
an
immediate
action
the
hasty
little
woman
had
darted
into
the
heart
of
the
difficulty
at
once
every
moment
she
lingered
wore
her
out
and
disgusted
her
more
with
the
life
and
fate
which
nevertheless
it
was
impossible
to
abandon
or
shrink
from
nothing
was
so
safe
as
to
make
matters
irrevocable
to
plunge
over
the
verge
at
once
all
gleaming
with
resolve
and
animation
with
the
frosty
chill
exhilarating
air
which
had
kindled
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
the
light
in
her
eyes
with
haste
resentment
every
feeling
that
can
quicken
the
heart
and
make
the
pulses
leap
nettie
had
flashed
into
the
little
parlour
where
all
was
so
quiet
and
leisurely
there
susan
sat
in
close
confabulation
with
the
bushman
the
children
had
been
banished
out
of
the
room
because
their
mother
head
was
not
equal
to
their
noise
and
restlessness
when
they
came
in
with
nettie
as
was
inevitable
mrs
fred
sustained
the
invasion
with
fretful
looks
and
a
certain
peevish
abstraction
she
was
evidently
interrupted
by
the
rapid
entrance
which
was
as
unwelcome
as
it
was
hasty
cold
though
the
night
was
mrs
fred
leaning
back
upon
her
sofa
fanned
her
pink
cheeks
with
her
handkerchief
and
looked
annoyed
as
well
as
disturbed
when
her
children
came
trooping
into
the
room
clamorous
for
tea
behind
the
little
impetuous
figure
which
at
once
hushed
and
protected
them
susan
became
silent
all
at
once
sank
back
on
the
sofa
and
concealed
the
faded
flush
upon
her
cheeks
and
the
embarrassed
conscious
air
she
wore
behind
the
handkerchief
which
she
used
so
assiduously
neither
she
nor
her
visitor
took
much
share
in
the
conversation
that
rose
round
the
domestic
table
nettie
too
was
sufficiently
absorbed
in
her
own
concerns
to
say
little
and
nobody
there
was
sufficiently
observant
to
remark
what
a
sudden
breath
of
haste
and
nervous
decision
inspired
the
little
household
ruler
as
she
dispensed
the
family
when
tea
was
over
nettie
sent
her
children
out
of
the
way
with
peremptory
distinctness
and
stayed
behind
them
to
make
her
communication
if
she
noticed
vaguely
a
certain
confused
impatience
and
desire
to
get
rid
of
her
in
the
looks
of
her
sister
and
the
australian
she
attached
no
distinct
meaning
to
it
but
spoke
out
with
all
the
simplicity
of
an
independent
power
knowing
all
authority
and
executive
force
to
lie
in
her
own
hands
alone
when
do
you
think
you
can
be
ready
to
start
my
mind
is
made
up
i
shall
set
to
work
immediately
to
prepare
said
nettie
now
look
here
susan
you
have
been
thinking
of
it
for
months
so
it
is
not
like
taking
you
by
surprise
there
is
a
ship
that
sails
on
the
if
everything
is
packed
and
ready
will
you
consent
to
go
on
that
day
mrs
fred
started
with
unfeigned
surprise
and
not
without
a
little
consternation
turned
her
eyes
towards
her
friend
before
answering
her
sister
it
is
just
nettie
way
cried
susan
just
how
she
always
does
holds
out
against
you
to
the
very
last
and
then
turns
round
and
darts
off
before
you
can
draw
your
breath
the
and
this
is
the
of
course
we
ca
do
it
nettie
i
shall
want
quantities
of
things
and
mr
chatham
you
know
is
not
used
to
your
ways
and
be
whisked
off
in
a
moment
whenever
you
please
i
daresay
it
very
kind
of
mr
chatham
said
nettie
but
i
can
take
you
out
very
well
by
myself
just
as
well
as
i
brought
you
here
and
i
ca
afford
to
get
you
quantities
of
things
susan
so
please
to
understand
i
am
going
off
to
pack
up
and
on
the
we
shall
go
once
more
under
nettie
impatient
eyes
a
look
and
a
smile
passed
between
her
sister
and
the
australian
never
very
patient
at
any
time
the
girl
was
entirely
aggravated
out
of
all
toleration
now
i
ca
tell
what
you
may
have
to
smile
to
each
other
about
said
nettie
it
is
no
very
smiling
business
to
me
but
since
i
am
driven
to
it
i
shall
go
at
once
or
not
at
all
and
so
that
you
understand
me
that
is
all
i
want
to
say
with
which
words
she
disappeared
suddenly
to
the
multitudinous
work
that
lay
before
her
thinking
as
little
of
susan
opposition
as
of
the
clamour
raised
by
the
children
when
the
hard
sentence
of
going
half
an
hour
earlier
to
bed
was
pronounced
upon
them
nettie
haste
and
peremptoriness
were
mixed
if
it
must
be
told
with
a
little
resentment
against
the
world
in
general
she
had
ceased
being
sad
she
was
roused
and
indignant
by
the
time
she
had
subdued
the
refractory
children
and
disposed
of
them
for
the
night
those
vast
australian
boxes
which
they
had
brought
with
them
across
the
seas
were
placed
in
the
little
hall
under
the
pale
light
of
the
lamp
ready
for
the
process
of
packing
into
which
nettie
plunged
without
a
moment
interval
while
mrs
smith
told
edward
rider
her
story
nettie
was
flying
up
and
down
stairs
with
armfuls
of
things
to
be
packed
and
pressing
smith
himself
into
her
service
ere
long
the
hall
was
piled
with
heaps
of
personal
property
ready
to
be
transferred
to
those
big
receptacles
in
the
excitement
of
the
work
her
spirit
rose
the
headlong
haste
with
which
she
carried
on
her
operations
kept
her
mind
in
balance
once
or
twice
susan
peeped
out
from
the
parlour
door
and
something
like
an
echo
of
laughter
rang
out
into
the
hall
after
one
of
those
inspections
nettie
took
no
notice
either
of
the
look
or
the
laugh
she
built
in
those
piles
of
baggage
with
the
rapidest
symmetrical
arrangement
to
the
admiration
of
smith
who
stood
wondering
by
and
did
what
he
could
to
help
her
with
troubled
she
did
not
stop
to
make
any
sentimental
reflections
or
to
think
of
the
thankless
office
in
which
she
was
about
to
confirm
herself
beyond
remedy
by
this
sudden
and
precipitate
step
thinking
had
done
nettie
little
good
hitherto
she
felt
herself
on
her
true
ground
again
when
she
took
to
doing
instead
the
lamp
burned
dimly
overhead
throwing
down
a
light
confused
with
frost
upon
the
hall
all
encumbered
with
the
goods
of
the
wandering
family
perhaps
it
was
with
a
certain
unconscious
symbolism
that
nettie
buried
her
own
personal
wardrobe
deep
in
the
lowest
depths
making
that
the
foundation
for
all
the
after
superstructure
smith
stood
by
ready
to
hand
her
anything
she
might
want
gazing
at
her
with
doubtful
amazement
the
idea
of
setting
off
to
australia
at
a
few
days
notice
filled
him
with
respect
and
admiration
a
matter
of
a
three
months
voyage
said
smith
and
if
i
might
make
bold
to
ask
miss
if
the
weather
ai
too
bad
for
anything
how
will
you
pass
away
the
time
on
board
ship
when
there
ai
nobody
to
speak
to
but
to
be
sure
the
gentleman
the
gentleman
is
not
going
with
us
said
nettie
peremptorily
and
there
are
the
children
to
pass
away
the
time
my
time
passes
too
quick
whatever
other
people
may
do
where
is
mrs
smith
that
i
see
nothing
of
her
gone
out
how
very
odd
she
should
go
out
now
of
all
times
in
the
world
where
has
she
gone
do
you
suppose
not
to
be
ungrateful
to
you
who
are
very
kind
a
woman
is
of
course
twenty
times
the
use
a
man
is
in
most
things
thank
you
not
that
those
coloured
frocks
now
there
that
bundle
with
the
pink
and
the
blue
one
would
suppose
that
even
a
man
might
know
coloured
frocks
when
he
saw
them
said
nettie
with
despairing
resignation
springing
up
from
her
knees
to
seize
what
she
wanted
thank
you
i
think
perhaps
if
you
would
just
go
and
make
yourself
comfortable
and
read
your
paper
i
should
get
on
better
i
am
not
used
to
having
anybody
to
help
me
i
got
on
quite
as
well
thank
you
by
myself
smith
withdrew
not
without
some
confusion
and
discomfort
to
his
condemned
cell
and
nettie
went
on
silent
and
swift
with
her
labours
quite
as
well
better
said
nettie
to
herself
other
people
never
will
understand
now
i
know
better
than
to
try
anybody
if
that
hasty
breath
was
a
sigh
there
was
little
sound
of
sorrow
in
it
it
was
a
little
gust
of
impatience
indignation
intolerance
even
and
hasty
she
alone
knew
what
she
could
do
and
must
do
not
one
other
soul
in
the
world
beside
could
enter
into
her
inevitable
work
and
way
nettie
did
not
hear
the
footstep
which
she
might
have
recognised
ringing
rapidly
down
the
frosty
road
she
was
too
busy
rustling
about
with
perpetual
motion
folding
and
refolding
and
smoothing
into
miraculous
compactness
all
the
heterogeneous
elements
of
that
mass
when
a
sudden
knock
came
to
the
door
she
started
struck
with
alarm
then
paused
a
moment
looking
round
her
and
perceiving
at
one
hasty
glance
that
nobody
could
possibly
enter
without
seeing
both
herself
and
her
occupation
made
one
prompt
step
to
the
door
which
nobody
appeared
to
open
it
was
mrs
smith
no
doubt
but
the
sudden
breathless
flutter
which
came
upon
nettie
cast
doubts
upon
that
rapid
conclusion
she
opened
it
quickly
with
a
certain
breathless
sudden
promptitude
and
looked
out
pale
and
dauntless
understanding
by
instinct
that
some
new
trial
to
her
fortitude
was
there
on
the
other
hand
edward
rider
pressed
in
suddenly
almost
without
perceiving
it
was
nettie
they
were
both
standing
in
the
hall
together
before
they
fully
recognised
each
other
then
the
doctor
gazing
round
him
at
the
unusual
confusion
gave
an
involuntary
groan
out
of
the
depths
of
his
heart
then
it
is
true
said
dr
rider
he
stood
among
the
chaos
and
saw
all
his
own
dreams
broken
up
and
shattered
in
pieces
even
passion
failed
him
in
that
first
bitterness
of
conviction
nettie
stood
opposite
with
the
sleeves
of
her
black
dress
turned
up
from
her
little
white
nimble
wrists
her
hair
pushed
back
from
her
cheeks
pushed
quite
behind
one
delicate
ear
her
eyes
shining
with
all
those
lights
of
energy
and
purpose
which
came
to
them
as
soon
as
she
took
up
her
own
character
again
she
met
his
eye
with
a
little
air
of
defiance
involuntary
and
almost
unconscious
it
is
quite
true
said
nettie
bursting
forth
in
sudden
i
have
my
work
to
do
and
i
must
do
it
as
best
i
can
i
can
not
keep
considering
you
all
and
losing
my
life
i
must
do
what
god
has
given
me
to
do
or
i
must
die
never
had
nettie
been
so
near
breaking
down
and
falling
into
sudden
womanish
tears
and
despair
she
would
not
yield
to
the
overpowering
momentary
passion
she
clutched
at
the
bundle
of
frocks
again
and
made
room
for
them
spasmodically
in
the
box
which
she
had
already
packed
edward
rider
stood
silent
gazing
at
her
as
in
her
sudden
anguish
nettie
pulled
down
and
reconstructed
that
curious
honeycomb
but
he
had
not
come
here
merely
to
gaze
while
the
catastrophe
was
preparing
he
went
up
and
seized
her
busy
hands
raised
her
up
in
spite
of
her
resistance
and
thrust
away
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
that
great
box
in
which
all
his
hopes
were
being
packed
away
there
is
first
a
question
to
settle
between
you
and
me
cried
the
doctor
you
shall
not
do
it
no
i
forbid
it
nettie
because
you
are
wilful
cried
edward
rider
hoarse
and
violent
grasping
the
hands
tighter
with
a
strain
in
which
other
passions
than
love
mingled
am
i
to
give
up
all
the
rights
of
a
man
you
are
going
away
without
even
giving
me
just
warning
without
a
word
without
a
sign
and
you
think
i
will
permit
it
nettie
never
by
heaven
dr
edward
said
nettie
trembling
half
with
terror
half
with
resolution
you
have
no
authority
over
me
we
are
two
people
we
are
not
one
i
should
not
have
gone
away
without
a
word
or
a
sign
i
should
have
said
to
you
whatever
had
happened
but
that
is
different
from
permitting
or
forbidding
let
us
say
now
and
get
it
over
if
that
will
please
you
better
she
cried
drawing
her
hands
from
his
grasp
but
i
do
not
interfere
with
your
business
and
i
must
do
mine
my
own
way
the
doctor
was
in
no
mood
to
argue
he
thrust
the
big
box
she
had
packed
away
into
a
corner
and
closed
it
with
a
vindictive
clang
it
gave
him
a
little
room
to
move
in
that
little
commonplace
hall
with
its
dim
lamp
which
had
witnessed
so
many
of
the
most
memorable
scenes
of
his
life
look
here
cried
dr
rider
authority
has
little
to
do
with
it
if
you
had
been
my
wife
nettie
to
be
sure
you
could
not
have
deserted
me
it
is
as
great
a
cruelty
it
is
as
hard
upon
me
this
you
are
trying
to
do
i
have
submitted
hitherto
and
heaven
knows
it
has
been
bitter
enough
and
you
scorn
me
for
my
submission
said
the
doctor
making
the
discovery
by
instinct
when
a
fellow
obeys
you
it
is
only
contempt
you
feel
for
him
but
i
tell
you
nettie
i
will
bear
it
no
longer
you
shall
not
go
away
this
is
not
to
be
i
will
neither
say
nor
think
of
it
what
is
your
business
is
my
business
and
i
declare
to
you
you
shall
not
go
unless
i
go
too
ah
i
forgot
they
tell
me
there
is
a
fellow
an
australian
who
ventures
to
pretend
i
do
mean
to
say
i
believe
it
you
think
will
not
object
to
your
burdens
nettie
do
let
us
kill
each
other
let
us
take
all
the
world
on
our
shoulders
cried
the
doctor
drawing
near
again
with
passionate
looks
rather
than
part
there
was
a
pause
neither
of
them
could
speak
at
that
moment
nettie
who
felt
her
resolution
going
her
heart
melting
yet
knew
she
dared
not
give
way
clasped
her
hands
tight
in
each
other
and
stood
trembling
yet
refusing
to
tremble
collecting
her
voice
and
thoughts
the
doctor
occupied
that
moment
of
suspense
in
a
way
which
might
have
looked
ludicrous
in
other
circumstances
but
was
a
relief
to
the
passion
that
possessed
him
he
dragged
the
other
vast
australian
box
to
the
same
corner
where
he
had
set
the
first
and
piled
them
one
above
the
other
then
he
collected
with
awkward
care
all
the
heaps
of
garments
which
lay
about
and
carried
them
off
in
the
other
direction
to
the
stairs
where
he
laid
them
carefully
with
a
clumsy
tenderness
when
he
had
swept
away
all
these
encumbrances
as
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
he
came
back
to
nettie
and
once
more
clasped
the
firm
hands
which
held
each
other
fast
she
broke
away
from
him
with
a
sudden
cry
you
acknowledged
it
was
impossible
cried
nettie
it
is
not
my
doing
or
anybody
no
one
shall
take
the
world
on
his
shoulders
for
my
sake
i
ask
nobody
to
bear
my
burdens
thank
you
for
not
believing
it
that
is
a
comfort
at
least
never
surely
any
one
else
and
not
you
not
you
dr
edward
let
us
make
an
end
of
it
i
will
never
consent
to
put
my
yoke
upon
your
shoulders
but
i
i
will
never
forget
you
or
blame
you
any
more
it
is
all
hard
but
we
can
not
help
it
do
make
it
harder
you
who
are
the
only
one
that
no
more
say
any
more
at
this
moment
the
parlour
door
opened
suddenly
nettie
trembling
mouth
and
frame
and
the
wild
protest
and
contradiction
which
were
bursting
from
the
lips
of
the
doctor
were
lost
upon
the
spectator
absorbed
in
her
own
affairs
and
full
of
excitement
on
her
own
account
who
looked
out
perhaps
mr
edward
will
walk
in
said
mrs
fred
now
he
is
here
to
witness
what
i
mean
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
please
nettie
i
did
not
think
i
should
ever
appeal
to
you
mr
edward
against
nettie
wilfulness
but
really
now
we
none
of
us
can
put
up
with
it
any
longer
please
to
walk
in
and
hear
what
i
got
to
say
the
big
bushman
stood
before
the
little
fire
in
the
parlour
extinguishing
its
tiny
glow
with
his
vast
shadow
the
lamp
burned
dimly
upon
the
table
a
certain
air
of
confusion
was
in
the
room
perhaps
it
was
because
nettie
had
already
swept
her
own
particular
belongings
out
of
that
apartment
which
once
to
the
doctor
eyes
had
breathed
of
her
presence
in
every
corner
but
it
did
not
look
like
nettie
parlour
mrs
fred
with
the
broad
white
bands
of
her
cap
streaming
over
her
black
dress
had
just
assumed
her
place
on
the
sofa
which
was
her
domestic
throne
nettie
much
startled
and
taken
by
surprise
stood
by
the
table
waiting
with
a
certain
air
of
wondering
impatience
what
was
to
be
said
to
her
with
still
the
sleeves
turned
up
from
her
tiny
wrists
and
her
fingers
unconsciously
busy
expressing
her
restless
intolerance
of
this
delay
by
a
hundred
involuntary
tricks
and
movements
the
doctor
stood
close
by
her
looking
only
at
nettie
watching
her
with
eyes
intent
as
if
she
might
suddenly
disappear
from
under
his
very
gaze
as
for
the
australian
he
stood
uneasy
under
nettie
rapid
investigating
glance
and
the
slower
survey
which
dr
rider
made
on
entering
he
plucked
at
his
big
beard
and
spread
out
his
large
person
with
a
confusion
and
embarrassment
rather
more
than
merely
belonged
to
the
stranger
in
a
family
party
while
mrs
fred
upon
her
sofa
took
up
her
handkerchief
and
once
more
began
to
fan
her
pink
cheeks
what
was
coming
after
a
moment
pause
upon
which
nettie
could
scarcely
keep
herself
from
breaking
susan
spoke
nettie
has
always
had
the
upper
hand
so
much
that
she
thinks
i
am
always
to
do
exactly
as
she
pleases
burst
forth
mrs
fred
and
i
doubt
poor
fred
encouraged
her
in
it
because
he
felt
he
was
obliged
to
my
family
and
always
gave
in
to
her
but
now
i
have
somebody
to
stand
by
me
added
susan
fanning
still
more
violently
and
with
a
sound
in
her
voice
which
betrayed
a
possibility
of
tears
now
i
have
somebody
to
stand
by
me
i
tell
you
once
for
all
nettie
i
will
not
go
on
the
nettie
gazed
at
her
sister
in
silence
without
attempting
to
say
anything
then
she
lifted
her
eyes
inquiringly
to
the
australian
in
his
uneasy
spectator
position
before
the
fire
she
was
not
much
discomposed
evidently
by
that
sudden
assertion
of
will
possibly
nettie
was
used
to
it
but
she
looked
curious
and
roused
and
rather
eager
to
know
what
was
it
now
i
will
not
go
on
the
cried
mrs
fred
with
a
hysterical
toss
of
her
head
i
will
not
be
treated
like
a
child
and
told
to
get
ready
whenever
nettie
pleases
she
pretends
it
is
all
for
our
sake
but
it
is
for
the
sake
of
having
her
own
will
and
because
she
has
taken
a
sudden
disgust
at
something
i
asked
you
in
mr
edward
because
you
are
her
friend
and
because
you
are
the
children
uncle
and
ought
to
know
how
they
are
provided
for
mr
chatham
and
i
said
susan
overcome
by
her
feelings
and
agitating
the
handkerchief
violently
have
settled
to
be
married
first
before
we
set
out
if
a
shell
had
fallen
in
the
peaceful
apartment
the
effect
could
not
have
been
more
startling
the
two
who
had
been
called
in
to
receive
that
intimation
and
who
up
to
this
moment
had
been
standing
together
listening
languidly
enough
too
much
absorbed
in
the
matter
between
themselves
to
be
very
deeply
concerned
about
anything
mrs
fred
could
say
or
do
fell
suddenly
apart
with
the
wildest
amazement
in
their
looks
susan
you
are
mad
cried
nettie
gazing
aghast
at
her
sister
with
an
air
of
mingled
astonishment
and
incredulity
the
doctor
too
much
excited
to
receive
with
ordinary
decorum
information
so
important
made
a
sudden
step
up
to
the
big
embarrassed
australian
who
stood
before
the
fire
gazing
into
vacancy
and
looking
the
very
embodiment
of
conscious
awkwardness
dr
rider
stretched
out
both
his
hands
and
grasped
the
gigantic
fist
of
the
bushman
with
an
effusion
which
took
that
worthy
altogether
by
surprise
my
dear
fellow
i
wish
you
joy
i
wish
you
joy
anything
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
in
command
me
cried
the
doctor
with
a
suppressed
shout
of
triumph
then
he
returned
restlessly
towards
nettie
they
all
turned
to
her
with
instinctive
curiosity
never
in
all
her
troubles
had
nettie
been
so
pale
she
looked
in
her
sister
face
with
a
kind
of
despair
is
this
susan
she
said
with
a
sorrowful
wonder
as
different
as
possible
from
the
doctor
joyful
surprise
not
something
said
to
vex
us
really
true
and
this
has
been
going
on
and
i
knew
nothing
of
it
and
all
this
time
you
have
been
urging
me
to
go
back
to
the
colony
as
if
you
had
no
other
thoughts
if
you
had
made
up
your
mind
to
this
what
was
the
use
of
driving
me
desperate
cried
nettie
in
a
sudden
outburst
of
that
incomprehension
which
aches
in
generous
hearts
then
she
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
from
her
sister
uttering
suppressed
sobs
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
on
the
sofa
to
the
australian
before
the
fire
what
is
the
good
of
talking
said
nettie
with
a
certain
indignant
impatient
indulgence
coming
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
nobody
knew
so
well
as
she
did
how
utterly
useless
it
was
to
remonstrate
or
complain
she
dropt
into
the
nearest
chair
and
began
with
hasty
tremulous
hands
to
smooth
down
the
cuffs
of
her
black
sleeves
in
the
bitterness
of
the
moment
it
was
not
the
sudden
deliverance
but
the
heartlessness
and
domestic
treachery
that
struck
nettie
she
the
champion
and
defender
of
this
helpless
family
for
years
who
had
given
them
bread
and
served
it
to
them
with
her
own
cheerful
unwearied
hands
who
had
protected
as
well
as
provided
for
them
in
her
dauntless
innocence
and
youth
when
she
was
thus
cast
off
on
the
brink
of
the
costliest
sacrifice
of
all
it
was
not
the
delightful
sensation
of
freedom
which
occurred
to
nettie
she
fell
back
with
a
silent
pang
of
injury
swelling
in
her
heart
and
all
tremulous
and
hasty
gave
her
agitated
attention
to
the
simple
act
of
smoothing
down
her
sleeves
a
simple
but
symbolical
act
which
conveyed
a
world
of
meaning
to
the
mind
of
the
doctor
as
he
stood
watching
her
the
work
she
had
meant
to
do
was
over
nettie
occupation
was
gone
with
the
next
act
of
the
domestic
drama
she
had
nothing
to
do
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
utterly
vanquished
with
silent
promptitude
she
abdicated
on
the
instant
she
seemed
unable
to
strike
a
blow
for
the
leadership
thus
snatched
from
her
hands
with
proud
surprise
and
magnanimity
she
withdrew
forbearing
even
the
useless
reproaches
of
which
she
had
impatiently
asked
what
was
the
good
never
abdicated
emperor
laid
aside
his
robes
with
more
ominous
significance
than
nettie
with
fingers
trembling
between
haste
and
agitation
smoothed
down
round
her
shapely
wrists
those
sleeves
the
doctor
better
genius
saved
him
from
driving
the
indignant
titania
desperate
at
that
critical
moment
by
any
rejoicings
and
the
sight
of
nettie
agitation
so
far
calmed
dr
rider
that
he
made
the
most
sober
and
decorous
congratulations
to
the
whom
for
the
first
time
he
felt
grateful
to
perhaps
had
he
been
less
absorbed
in
his
own
affairs
he
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
remember
how
not
yet
a
year
ago
the
shabby
form
of
fred
lay
on
that
same
sofa
from
which
susan
had
announced
her
new
prospects
but
in
this
unexampled
revolution
of
affairs
no
thought
of
fred
disturbed
his
brother
whose
mind
was
thoroughly
occupied
with
the
sudden
tumult
of
his
own
hopes
oh
yes
i
hope
i
shall
be
happy
at
last
after
all
my
troubles
i
have
to
look
to
myself
mr
edward
and
your
poor
brother
would
have
been
the
last
to
blame
me
sobbed
mrs
fred
with
involuntary
then
followed
a
pause
the
change
was
too
sudden
and
extraordinary
and
involved
results
too
deeply
important
to
every
individual
present
to
make
words
possible
mrs
fred
with
her
face
buried
in
her
handkerchief
and
nettie
her
whole
frame
thrilling
with
mortification
and
failure
tremulously
trying
to
button
her
sleeves
and
bestowing
her
whole
mind
upon
that
operation
were
discouraging
interlocutors
and
after
the
doctor
and
the
bushman
had
shaken
hands
their
powers
of
communication
were
exhausted
the
silence
was
at
length
broken
by
the
australian
who
clearing
his
voice
between
every
three
words
delivered
his
embarrassed
sentiments
as
follows
i
trust
miss
nettie
you
not
think
you
been
unfairly
dealt
by
or
that
any
change
is
necessary
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
of
course
said
mr
chatham
growing
red
and
plucking
at
his
beard
neither
your
sister
nor
i
found
out
till
quite
lately
how
things
were
going
to
be
and
as
for
you
making
any
change
in
consequence
or
thinking
we
could
be
anything
but
glad
to
have
you
with
us
here
the
alarming
countenance
of
nettie
who
had
left
off
buttoning
her
sleeves
brought
her
new
relation
to
a
sudden
stop
under
the
blaze
of
her
inquiring
eyes
the
bushman
could
go
no
farther
he
looked
at
susan
for
assistance
but
susan
was
still
absorbed
in
her
handkerchief
and
while
he
paused
for
expression
the
little
abdicated
monarch
took
up
the
broken
thread
thank
you
said
nettie
rising
suddenly
i
knew
you
were
honest
it
is
very
good
of
you
too
to
be
glad
to
have
me
with
you
you
do
know
any
better
i
abdicated
mr
chatham
but
because
it
rather
startling
to
have
one
business
taken
out
of
one
hands
like
this
it
will
be
very
kind
of
everybody
not
to
say
anything
more
i
do
quite
understand
it
all
just
at
this
moment
dr
edward
we
can
talk
please
not
you
surely
understand
me
you
when
one
life
is
changed
all
in
a
moment
one
does
not
exactly
see
where
one
is
standing
just
at
once
i
mean
what
i
say
she
continued
holding
her
head
high
with
restrained
excitement
and
trying
to
conceal
the
nervous
agitation
which
possessed
her
as
the
doctor
hastened
before
her
to
open
the
door
do
come
after
me
please
do
say
anything
i
can
not
bear
any
more
but
said
the
doctor
holding
fast
the
trembling
hand
nettie
was
too
much
overstrained
and
excited
to
speak
more
a
single
sudden
sob
burst
from
her
as
she
drew
her
hand
out
of
his
and
disappeared
like
a
flying
sprite
the
doctor
saw
the
heaving
of
her
breast
the
height
of
which
could
go
no
further
he
went
back
into
the
parlour
like
a
true
lover
and
spied
no
more
upon
nettie
hour
of
weakness
without
her
it
looked
a
vulgar
scene
enough
in
that
little
from
which
the
smoke
of
fred
pipe
had
never
fairly
disappeared
and
where
fred
himself
had
lain
in
dismal
state
dr
rider
said
a
hasty
to
fred
successor
and
went
off
hurriedly
into
the
changed
world
which
surrounded
that
unconscious
cottage
though
the
frost
had
not
relaxed
and
the
air
breathed
no
balm
no
sudden
leap
from
december
to
june
could
have
changed
the
atmosphere
so
entirely
to
the
excited
wayfarer
who
traced
back
the
joyful
path
towards
the
lights
of
carlingford
twinkling
brilliant
through
the
christmas
frost
as
he
paused
to
look
back
upon
that
house
which
now
contained
all
his
hopes
a
sudden
shadow
appeared
at
a
lighted
window
looking
out
nettie
could
not
see
the
owner
of
the
footsteps
which
moved
her
to
that
sudden
involuntary
expression
of
what
was
in
her
thoughts
but
he
could
see
her
standing
full
in
the
light
and
the
sight
went
to
the
doctor
heart
he
took
off
his
hat
insanely
in
the
darkness
and
waved
his
hand
to
her
though
she
could
not
see
him
and
after
the
shadow
had
disappeared
continued
to
stand
watching
with
tender
folly
if
perhaps
some
indication
of
presence
might
again
reveal
itself
he
walked
upon
air
as
he
went
back
at
last
cold
but
joyful
through
the
blank
solitude
of
grange
lane
nothing
could
have
come
amiss
to
the
doctor
in
that
dawn
of
happiness
he
could
have
found
it
in
his
heart
to
mount
his
drag
again
and
drive
ten
miles
in
celestial
patience
at
the
call
of
any
capricious
invalid
he
was
to
find
no
summons
awaiting
him
when
he
went
home
no
outlet
for
the
universal
charity
and
that
possessed
him
instead
he
set
his
tenderly
by
the
side
of
the
blazing
fire
and
drawing
another
chair
opposite
gazed
with
secret
smiles
at
the
visionary
nettie
who
once
had
taken
up
her
position
there
was
it
by
prophetic
instinct
that
the
little
colonial
girl
whose
first
appearance
so
discomposed
the
doctor
had
assumed
that
place
dr
rider
contemplated
the
empty
chair
with
smiles
that
would
have
compromised
his
character
for
sanity
with
any
uninstructed
observer
when
the
mournful
mary
disturbed
his
reverie
by
her
noiseless
and
penitent
entrance
with
the
little
supper
which
she
meant
at
once
for
a
and
compensation
for
the
dinner
lost
she
carried
with
her
a
vivid
impression
that
somebody
had
left
her
master
a
fortune
under
such
beatific
circumstances
closed
the
evening
that
had
opened
amid
such
clouds
henceforth
so
far
as
the
doctor
could
read
the
future
no
difficulties
but
those
common
to
all
wooers
beset
the
course
of
his
true
love
chapter
xvii
when
the
red
gleams
of
the
early
sunshine
shone
into
that
window
from
which
nettie
had
looked
out
last
night
the
wintry
light
came
in
with
agitating
revelations
not
simply
upon
another
morning
but
upon
a
new
world
as
usual
nettie
thoughts
were
expressed
in
things
tangible
she
had
risen
from
her
sleepless
bed
while
it
was
still
almost
dark
and
to
look
at
her
now
a
stranger
might
have
supposed
her
to
be
proceeding
with
her
last
night
work
with
the
constancy
of
a
monomaniac
little
freddy
sat
up
in
his
crib
rubbing
his
eyes
and
marvelling
what
nettie
could
be
about
as
indeed
anybody
might
have
marvelled
with
all
those
boxes
and
drawers
about
and
heaps
of
personal
belongings
what
was
she
going
to
do
she
could
not
have
answered
the
question
without
pain
but
had
you
waited
long
enough
nettie
object
would
have
been
apparent
not
entirely
free
of
that
air
of
agitated
haste
not
recovered
from
the
excitement
of
this
discovery
she
was
relieving
her
restless
activity
by
a
significant
rearrangement
of
all
the
possessions
of
the
family
she
was
separating
with
rapid
fingers
those
stores
which
had
hitherto
lain
lovingly
together
common
property
for
the
first
time
for
years
nettie
had
set
herself
to
discriminate
what
belonged
to
herself
from
the
general
store
and
perhaps
by
way
of
softening
that
disjunction
was
separating
into
harmonious
order
the
little
wardrobes
which
were
no
longer
to
be
under
her
charge
freddy
opened
his
eyes
to
see
all
his
own
special
belongings
articles
which
he
recognised
with
all
the
tenacious
proprietorship
of
childhood
going
into
one
little
box
by
themselves
in
dreadful
isolation
the
child
did
not
know
what
horrible
sentence
might
have
been
passed
upon
him
while
he
slept
he
gazed
at
those
swift
inexorable
fingers
with
the
gradual
sob
rising
in
his
poor
little
breast
that
silent
tempest
heaved
and
rose
as
he
saw
all
the
items
following
each
other
and
when
his
last
new
acquisition
the
latest
addition
to
his
wardrobe
lay
solemnly
smoothed
down
upon
the
top
freddy
patience
could
bear
no
more
bursting
into
a
long
howl
of
affliction
he
called
aloud
upon
nettie
to
explain
that
mystery
was
he
going
to
be
sent
away
was
some
mysterious
executioner
black
man
or
other
horrid
vision
of
fate
coming
for
the
victim
freddy
appeal
roused
from
her
work
the
abdicated
family
sovereign
if
i
to
be
sent
away
i
sha
go
cried
freddy
i
run
off
and
come
back
again
i
sha
go
anywhere
unless
you
go
nettie
i
hold
on
so
fast
you
put
me
away
and
oh
i
be
good
i
be
so
good
nettie
who
was
not
much
given
to
caresses
came
up
and
put
sudden
arms
round
her
special
nursling
she
laid
her
cheek
to
his
with
a
little
outbreak
of
natural
emotion
it
is
i
who
am
to
be
sent
away
cried
nettie
yielding
for
a
moment
to
the
natural
bitterness
then
she
bethought
herself
of
certain
thoughts
of
comfort
which
had
not
failed
to
interject
themselves
into
her
heart
and
withdrew
with
a
little
precipitation
alarmed
by
the
inconsistency
the
insincerity
of
her
feelings
get
up
freddy
you
are
not
going
away
except
home
to
the
colony
where
you
want
to
go
she
said
be
good
all
the
same
for
you
know
you
must
not
trouble
mamma
and
make
haste
and
do
be
always
calling
for
nettie
do
you
know
you
must
do
without
nettie
some
time
jump
up
and
be
a
man
when
i
am
a
man
i
sha
want
you
said
freddy
getting
up
with
reluctance
but
i
ca
be
a
man
now
and
what
am
i
to
do
with
the
buttons
if
you
wo
help
me
i
shall
not
have
buttons
like
those
when
i
am
a
man
it
was
not
in
human
nature
to
refrain
from
giving
the
little
savage
an
admonitory
shake
that
is
all
i
am
good
for
nothing
but
buttons
said
nettie
with
whimsical
mortification
when
they
went
down
to
breakfast
she
sent
the
child
before
her
and
came
last
instead
of
first
waiting
till
they
were
all
assembled
mrs
fred
watched
her
advent
with
apprehensive
eyes
thinking
it
over
after
her
first
triumph
it
occurred
to
mrs
fred
that
the
loss
of
nettie
would
make
a
serious
difference
to
her
own
comfort
who
was
to
take
charge
of
the
children
and
conduct
those
vulgar
affairs
for
which
susan
feelings
disqualified
her
she
did
her
best
to
decipher
the
pale
face
which
appeared
over
the
breakfast
cups
and
saucers
opposite
what
did
nettie
mean
to
do
susan
revolved
the
question
in
considerable
panic
seeing
but
too
clearly
that
the
firm
little
hand
no
longer
trembled
and
that
nettie
was
absorbed
by
her
own
thoughts
thoughts
with
which
her
present
companions
had
but
little
to
do
mrs
fred
essayed
another
stroke
perhaps
i
was
hasty
nettie
last
night
but
richard
you
know
poor
fellow
said
susan
was
not
to
be
put
off
it
wo
make
any
difference
between
you
and
me
nettie
dear
we
have
always
been
so
united
whatever
has
happened
and
the
children
are
so
fond
of
you
and
as
for
me
said
mrs
fred
putting
back
the
strings
of
her
cap
and
pressing
her
handkerchief
upon
her
eyes
with
my
health
and
after
all
i
have
gone
through
how
i
could
ever
exist
without
you
i
ca
tell
and
richard
will
be
so
pleased
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
about
richard
please
said
nettie
not
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
should
have
taken
you
out
and
taken
care
of
you
had
you
chosen
me
but
you
ca
have
two
people
you
know
one
is
enough
for
anybody
never
mind
what
we
are
talking
about
freddy
it
is
only
your
buttons
nothing
else
as
long
as
you
were
my
business
i
should
have
scorned
to
complain
said
nettie
with
a
little
quiver
of
her
lip
nothing
would
have
made
me
forsake
you
or
leave
you
to
yourself
but
now
you
are
somebody
else
business
and
to
speak
of
it
making
no
difference
and
richard
being
pleased
and
so
forth
as
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
in
the
world
and
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
colony
it
is
simply
not
my
business
any
longer
cried
nettie
rising
impatiently
from
her
chair
that
is
all
that
can
be
said
but
i
desert
you
till
i
deliver
you
over
to
my
successor
susan
do
fear
then
you
do
feel
any
love
for
us
nettie
it
was
only
because
you
could
not
help
it
children
nettie
is
going
to
leave
us
said
mrs
fred
in
a
lamentable
voice
then
who
is
to
be
instead
of
nettie
oh
look
here
i
know
chatham
said
the
little
girl
i
hate
chatham
said
freddy
with
a
little
shriek
i
shall
go
where
nettie
goes
all
my
things
are
in
my
box
nettie
is
going
to
take
me
she
loves
me
best
of
you
all
i
kick
chatham
if
he
touches
me
why
ca
some
one
tell
nettie
she
to
go
too
said
the
eldest
boy
she
most
good
of
all
what
does
nettie
want
to
go
away
for
but
i
do
mind
for
we
have
to
do
what
nettie
tells
us
and
nobody
cares
for
chatham
cried
the
sweet
child
making
a
triumphant
somersault
out
of
his
chair
nettie
stood
looking
on
without
attempting
to
stop
the
tumult
which
arose
she
left
them
with
their
mother
after
a
few
minutes
and
went
out
to
breathe
the
outside
air
where
at
least
there
was
quiet
and
freedom
to
think
as
she
went
out
into
the
red
morning
sunshine
that
her
old
life
was
over
made
nettie
head
swim
with
bewildering
giddiness
she
went
up
softly
like
a
creature
in
a
dream
past
st
roque
where
already
the
christmas
decorators
had
begun
their
pretty
work
that
work
which
several
ages
ago
being
yesterday
nettie
had
taken
the
children
in
to
see
of
all
things
that
had
happened
between
that
moment
and
this
perhaps
the
impulse
of
escaping
out
into
the
open
air
without
anything
to
do
was
one
of
the
most
miraculous
insensibly
nettie
footsteps
quickened
as
she
became
aware
of
that
extraordinary
fact
the
hour
the
temperature
the
customs
of
her
life
were
equally
against
such
an
indulgence
it
was
a
comfort
to
recollect
that
though
everything
else
in
the
universe
was
altered
the
family
must
still
have
some
dinner
and
that
it
was
as
easy
to
think
while
walking
to
the
butcher
as
while
idling
and
doing
nothing
she
went
up
accordingly
towards
grange
lane
in
a
kind
of
wistful
solitude
drifted
apart
from
her
former
life
and
not
yet
definitely
attached
to
any
other
feeling
as
though
the
few
passengers
she
met
must
perceive
in
her
face
that
her
whole
fortune
was
changed
it
was
hard
for
nettie
to
realise
that
she
could
do
absolutely
nothing
at
this
moment
and
still
harder
for
her
to
think
that
her
fate
lay
undecided
in
edward
rider
hands
though
she
had
not
a
doubt
of
him
yet
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
he
who
must
take
the
first
step
was
somewhat
galling
to
the
pride
and
temper
of
the
little
autocrat
before
she
had
reached
the
butcher
or
even
come
near
enough
to
recognise
lucy
wodehouse
where
she
stood
at
the
garden
gate
setting
out
for
st
roque
nettie
heard
the
headlong
wheels
of
something
approaching
which
had
not
yet
come
in
sight
she
wound
herself
up
in
a
kind
of
nervous
desperation
for
the
encounter
that
was
coming
no
need
to
warn
her
who
it
was
nobody
but
the
doctor
flying
upon
wings
of
haste
and
love
could
drive
in
that
fashion
down
the
respectable
streets
of
carlingford
here
he
came
sweeping
round
that
corner
at
the
blue
boar
where
nettie
herself
had
once
mounted
the
drag
and
plunged
down
grange
lane
in
a
maze
of
speed
which
confused
horse
vehicle
and
driver
in
one
indistinct
gleaming
circle
to
the
excited
eyes
of
the
spectator
who
forced
herself
to
go
on
facing
them
with
an
exertion
of
all
her
powers
and
strenuous
resistance
of
the
impulse
to
turn
and
escape
why
should
nettie
escape
it
must
be
decided
one
way
or
other
she
held
on
dimly
with
rapid
trembling
steps
to
her
own
agitated
mind
nettie
herself
left
adrift
and
companionless
seemed
the
suitor
the
only
remnants
of
her
natural
force
that
remained
to
her
united
in
the
one
resolution
not
to
run
away
it
was
well
for
the
doctor
that
his
little
groom
had
the
eyes
and
activity
of
a
monkey
and
knew
the
exact
moment
at
which
to
dart
forward
and
catch
the
reins
which
his
master
flung
at
him
almost
without
pausing
in
his
perilous
career
the
doctor
made
a
leap
out
of
the
drag
which
was
more
like
that
of
a
mad
adventurer
than
a
man
whose
business
it
was
to
keep
other
people
limbs
in
due
repair
before
nettie
was
aware
that
he
had
stopped
he
was
by
her
side
dr
edward
she
exclaimed
breathlessly
hear
me
first
now
i
am
left
unrestrained
but
i
am
not
without
resources
do
think
you
are
bound
in
honour
to
say
anything
over
again
what
may
have
gone
before
i
forget
now
i
will
not
hold
you
to
your
word
you
are
not
to
have
pity
upon
me
cried
nettie
not
well
aware
what
she
was
saying
the
doctor
drew
her
arm
into
his
found
out
sorely
against
her
will
that
she
was
trembling
and
held
her
fast
not
without
a
sympathetic
tremor
in
the
arm
on
which
she
was
constrained
to
lean
but
i
hold
you
to
yours
said
the
doctor
there
has
not
been
any
obstacle
between
us
for
months
but
this
and
now
it
is
gone
do
you
think
i
will
forget
what
you
have
said
nettie
you
told
me
it
was
impossible
once
and
you
did
not
contradict
me
dr
edward
said
the
wilful
creature
withdrawing
her
hand
from
his
arm
i
can
walk
very
well
by
myself
thank
you
you
did
not
contradict
me
you
were
content
to
submit
to
what
could
not
be
helped
and
so
am
i
an
obstacle
which
is
only
removed
by
richard
chatham
said
nettie
with
female
cruelty
turning
her
eyes
full
and
suddenly
upon
her
unhappy
lover
does
not
count
for
much
i
do
not
hold
you
to
anything
we
are
both
free
what
dismayed
answer
the
doctor
might
have
made
to
this
heartless
speech
can
never
be
known
he
was
so
entirely
taken
aback
that
he
paused
clearing
his
throat
with
but
one
amazed
exclamation
of
her
name
but
before
his
astonishment
and
indignation
had
shaped
itself
into
words
their
interview
was
interrupted
an
irregular
patter
of
hasty
little
steps
and
outcries
of
a
childish
voice
behind
had
not
caught
the
attention
of
either
in
that
moment
of
excitement
but
just
as
nettie
delivered
this
cruel
outbreak
of
feminine
pride
and
the
little
pursuing
figure
made
up
to
them
and
plunged
at
her
dress
freddy
in
primitive
unconcern
for
anybody
but
himself
rushed
between
these
two
at
the
critical
instant
he
made
a
clutch
at
nettie
with
one
hand
and
with
all
the
force
of
the
other
thrust
away
the
astonished
doctor
freddy
errand
was
of
life
or
death
i
sha
go
with
any
one
but
nettie
cried
the
child
clinging
to
her
dress
i
hate
chatham
and
everybody
i
will
jump
into
the
sea
and
swim
back
again
i
will
never
never
leave
go
of
her
if
you
should
cut
my
hands
off
nettie
nettie
take
me
with
you
let
me
go
where
you
are
going
i
will
never
be
naughty
any
more
i
will
never
never
go
away
till
nettie
goes
i
love
nettie
best
go
away
all
of
you
cried
freddy
in
desperation
pushing
off
the
doctor
with
hands
and
feet
alike
i
will
stay
with
nettie
nobody
loves
nettie
but
me
nettie
had
no
power
left
to
resist
this
new
assault
she
dropped
down
on
one
knee
beside
the
child
and
clasped
him
to
her
in
a
passion
of
restrained
tears
and
sobbing
the
emotion
which
her
pride
would
not
permit
her
to
show
before
the
gathering
agitation
of
the
whole
morning
broke
forth
at
this
irresistible
touch
she
held
freddy
close
and
supported
herself
by
him
leaning
all
her
troubled
heart
and
trembling
frame
upon
the
little
figure
which
clung
to
her
bewildered
suddenly
growing
silent
and
afraid
in
that
passionate
grasp
freddy
spoke
no
more
but
turned
his
frightened
eyes
upon
the
doctor
trembling
with
the
great
throbs
of
nettie
breast
in
the
early
wintry
sunshine
on
the
quiet
rural
highroad
that
climax
of
the
gathering
emotion
of
years
befell
nettie
she
could
exercise
no
further
she
could
only
hide
her
face
that
no
one
might
see
and
close
her
quivering
lips
tight
that
no
one
might
hear
the
bursting
forth
of
her
heart
no
one
was
there
either
to
hear
or
see
nobody
but
edward
rider
who
stood
bending
with
sorrowful
tenderness
over
the
wilful
fairy
creature
whose
words
of
defiance
had
scarcely
died
from
her
lips
it
was
freddy
and
not
the
doctor
who
had
vanquished
nettie
but
the
insulted
lover
came
in
for
his
revenge
dr
rider
raised
her
up
quietly
asking
no
leave
and
lifted
her
into
the
drag
where
nettie
had
been
before
and
where
freddy
elated
and
joyful
took
his
place
beside
the
groom
convinced
that
he
was
to
go
now
with
the
only
true
guardian
his
little
life
had
known
the
doctor
drove
down
that
familiar
road
as
slowly
as
he
had
dashed
furiously
up
to
it
he
took
quiet
possession
of
the
agitated
trembling
creature
who
had
carried
her
empire
over
herself
too
far
at
last
nettie
had
broken
down
and
now
he
had
it
all
his
own
way
when
they
came
to
the
cottage
mrs
fred
whom
excitement
had
raised
to
a
troublesome
activity
came
eagerly
out
to
the
door
to
see
what
had
happened
and
the
two
children
who
emancipated
from
all
control
were
sliding
down
the
banisters
of
the
stair
one
after
the
other
in
wild
glee
and
recklessness
paused
in
their
dangerous
amusement
to
watch
the
new
arrival
oh
look
here
nettie
crying
said
one
to
the
other
with
calm
observation
the
words
brought
nettie
to
herself
i
am
not
crying
now
she
said
waking
into
sudden
strength
do
you
want
to
get
them
killed
before
they
go
away
all
you
people
susan
go
in
and
never
mind
i
was
not
not
quite
well
out
of
doors
but
i
mean
to
suffer
this
you
know
as
long
as
i
am
beside
them
dr
edward
come
in
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
we
have
nowhere
to
speak
to
each
other
but
here
said
nettie
pausing
in
the
little
hall
from
which
that
childish
tumult
had
died
away
in
sudden
awe
of
her
presence
but
we
have
spoken
to
each
other
here
before
now
i
did
not
mean
to
vex
you
then
at
least
i
did
mean
to
vex
you
but
nothing
more
here
she
paused
with
a
sob
the
echo
of
her
past
trouble
breaking
upon
her
words
as
happened
from
time
to
time
like
the
passion
of
a
child
then
burst
forth
again
a
moment
after
in
a
sudden
question
will
you
let
me
have
freddy
she
cried
surrendering
at
discretion
and
looking
eagerly
up
in
the
doctor
face
if
they
will
leave
him
may
i
keep
him
with
me
it
is
unnecessary
to
record
the
doctor
answer
he
would
have
swallowed
not
fred
only
but
mrs
fred
and
the
entire
family
had
that
gulp
been
needful
to
satisfy
nettie
but
was
not
sufficiently
blinded
to
his
own
interests
to
grant
this
except
under
certain
conditions
satisfactory
to
himself
when
the
doctor
mounted
the
drag
again
he
drove
away
into
elysium
with
a
smiling
cupid
behind
him
instead
of
the
little
groom
who
had
been
his
unconscious
master
confidant
so
long
and
had
watched
the
fluctuations
of
his
wooing
with
such
lively
curiosity
those
patients
who
had
paid
for
dr
rider
disappointments
in
many
a
violent
prescription
got
compensation
in
honeyed
draughts
and
hopeful
prognostications
wherever
the
doctor
went
he
saw
a
vision
of
that
little
drooping
head
reposing
after
all
the
agitation
of
the
morning
in
the
silence
and
rest
he
had
enjoined
with
brilliant
eyes
shining
with
thoughts
in
which
he
had
the
greatest
share
and
with
that
picture
before
his
eyes
went
flashing
along
the
wintry
road
with
secret
smiles
and
carried
hope
wherever
he
went
of
course
it
was
the
merest
fallacy
so
far
as
nettie
immediate
occupation
was
concerned
that
restless
little
woman
had
twenty
times
too
much
to
do
to
think
of
rest
more
to
do
than
ever
in
all
the
preparations
which
fell
upon
her
busy
hands
but
the
doctor
kept
his
imagination
all
the
same
and
pleased
himself
with
thoughts
of
her
reposing
in
a
visionary
tranquillity
which
wherever
it
was
to
be
found
certainly
did
not
exist
in
st
roque
cottage
in
that
sudden
tumult
of
new
events
and
hopes
chapter
xviii
i
always
thought
there
was
good
in
him
by
his
looks
said
miss
wodehouse
standing
in
the
porch
of
st
roque
after
the
had
gone
away
to
think
he
should
have
come
in
such
a
sweet
way
and
married
mrs
fred
just
what
we
all
were
wishing
for
if
we
could
have
ventured
to
think
it
possible
indeed
i
should
have
liked
to
have
given
mr
chatham
a
little
present
just
to
mark
my
sense
of
his
goodness
poor
man
i
wonder
if
he
repents
it
is
to
be
hoped
not
yet
said
lucy
hurrying
her
sister
away
before
mr
wentworth
could
come
out
and
join
them
for
affairs
were
seriously
compromised
between
the
perpetual
curate
and
the
object
of
his
affections
and
lucy
exhibited
a
certain
acerbity
under
the
circumstances
which
somewhat
amazed
the
old
maid
when
people
do
repent
my
belief
is
that
they
do
it
directly
said
miss
wodehouse
i
daresay
he
can
see
what
she
is
already
poor
man
and
i
hope
lucy
it
wo
drive
him
into
bad
ways
as
for
nettie
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
about
her
even
if
they
should
happen
to
quarrel
you
know
things
will
always
come
right
i
am
glad
they
were
not
married
both
at
the
same
time
nettie
has
such
sense
and
of
course
though
it
was
the
very
best
thing
that
could
happen
and
a
great
relief
to
everybody
concerned
to
be
sure
one
could
not
help
being
disgusted
with
that
woman
and
it
is
such
a
comfort
they
going
away
nettie
says
do
you
think
you
could
walk
a
little
quicker
there
is
somebody
in
grove
street
that
i
have
to
see
said
lucy
not
so
much
interested
as
her
sister
and
papa
will
be
home
at
one
to
lunch
then
i
shall
go
on
dear
if
you
have
no
objection
and
ask
when
the
doctor
and
nettie
are
coming
home
said
miss
wodehouse
and
take
poor
little
freddy
the
cakes
i
promised
him
poor
child
to
have
his
mother
go
off
and
marry
and
leave
him
never
mind
me
lucy
dear
i
do
not
walk
so
quickly
as
you
do
and
besides
i
have
to
go
home
first
for
the
cakes
so
saying
the
sisters
separated
and
miss
wodehouse
took
her
gentle
way
to
the
doctor
house
where
everything
had
been
brightened
up
and
where
freddy
waited
the
return
of
his
chosen
guardians
it
was
still
the
new
quarter
of
carlingford
a
region
of
streets
vulgar
new
roads
and
heaps
of
desolate
brick
and
mortar
if
the
doctor
had
ever
hoped
to
succeed
dr
marjoribanks
in
his
bowery
retirement
in
grange
lane
that
hope
nowadays
had
receded
into
the
darkest
distance
the
little
surgery
round
the
corner
still
shed
twinkles
of
red
and
blue
light
across
that
desolate
triangle
of
unbuilt
ground
upon
the
other
corner
houses
where
dwelt
people
unknown
to
society
in
carlingford
and
still
dr
rider
consented
to
call
himself
and
cultivate
the
patients
who
were
afraid
of
a
physician
miss
wodehouse
went
in
at
the
invitation
of
mary
to
see
the
little
which
the
master
of
the
house
had
provided
for
his
wife
it
had
been
only
an
unfurnished
room
in
dr
rider
bachelor
days
and
looked
out
upon
nothing
better
than
these
same
new
streets
the
vulgar
suburb
which
carlingford
disowned
miss
wodehouse
lingered
at
the
window
with
a
little
sigh
over
the
perversity
of
circumstances
if
miss
marjoribanks
had
only
been
nettie
or
nettie
miss
marjoribanks
if
not
only
love
and
happiness
but
the
old
doctor
practice
and
savings
could
but
have
been
brought
to
heap
up
the
measure
of
the
young
doctor
what
a
pity
that
one
can
not
have
everything
the
friendly
visitor
said
so
with
a
real
sigh
as
she
went
after
her
inspection
if
the
young
people
had
but
been
settling
in
grange
lane
in
good
society
and
with
dr
marjoribanks
practice
this
marriage
would
have
been
perfection
indeed
but
when
the
doctor
brought
nettie
home
and
set
her
in
that
which
her
image
had
possessed
so
long
he
saw
few
drawbacks
at
that
moment
to
the
felicity
of
his
lot
if
there
was
one
particular
in
which
his
sky
threatened
clouds
it
was
not
the
want
of
dr
marjoribanks
practice
but
the
presence
of
that
little
interloper
whom
the
doctor
in
his
heart
was
apt
to
call
by
uncomplimentary
names
and
did
not
regard
with
unmixed
favour
but
when
susan
and
her
australian
were
fairly
gone
and
all
fear
of
any
invasion
of
the
other
imps
which
dr
rider
inly
dreaded
up
to
the
last
moment
was
over
freddy
grew
more
and
more
tolerable
where
fred
once
lay
and
dozed
and
filled
the
doctor
house
with
heavy
fumes
and
discreditable
gossip
a
burden
on
his
brother
reluctant
hospitality
little
freddy
now
obliterated
that
dismal
memory
with
prayers
and
slumbers
of
childhood
and
where
the
discontented
doctor
had
grumbled
many
a
night
and
day
over
that
bare
habitation
of
his
which
was
a
house
and
not
a
home
nettie
diffused
herself
till
the
familiar
happiness
became
so
much
a
part
of
his
belongings
that
the
doctor
learned
to
grumble
once
more
at
the
womanish
accessories
which
he
had
once
missed
so
bitterly
and
the
little
wayward
heroine
who
by
dint
of
hard
labour
and
sacrifice
had
triumphantly
had
her
own
way
in
st
roque
cottage
loved
her
own
way
still
in
the
new
house
and
had
it
as
often
as
was
good
for
her
but
so
far
as
this
narrator
knows
nothing
calling
for
special
record
has
since
appeared
in
the
history
of
the
doctor
family
thus
reorganised
under
happier
auspices
and
discharging
its
duties
social
and
otherwise
though
not
exactly
in
society
to
the
satisfaction
and
approval
of
