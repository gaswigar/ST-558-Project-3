the
little
med
ship
came
out
of
overdrive
and
the
stars
were
strange
and
the
milky
way
seemed
unfamiliar
which
of
course
was
because
the
milky
way
and
the
local
cepheid
were
seen
from
an
unaccustomed
angle
and
a
pattern
of
varying
magnitudes
but
calhoun
grunted
in
satisfaction
there
was
a
banded
sun
off
to
port
which
was
good
a
breakout
at
no
more
than
sixty
from
one
destination
was
bad
in
a
strange
sector
of
the
galaxy
and
after
three
of
journeying
blind

and

murgatroyd
said
calhoun
comb
your
whiskers

set
to
astonish
the
natives
a
sleepy
small
shrill
voice
said
murgatroyd
the
came
crawling
out
of
the
small
cubbyhole
which
was
his
own
he
blinked
at
calhoun
we
due
to
land
shortly
calhoun
observed
you
will
impress
the
local
inhabitants
i
will
get
unpopular
according
to
the
records
there
been
no
med
ship
inspection
here
for
twelve
standard
years
and
that
was
practically
no
inspection
to
judge
by
the
report
murgatroyd
said
he
began
to
make
his
toilet
first
licking
his
whiskers
and
then
his
left
then
he
stood
up
and
shook
himself
and
looked

at
calhoun
are
companionable
small
animals
they
are
charmed
when
somebody
speaks
to
them
they
find
great
deep
satisfaction
in
imitating
the
actions
of
humans
as
parrots
and
mynahs
and
parakeets
imitate
human
speech
but
have
certain
valuable
genetically
transmitted
talents
which
make
them
much
more
valuable
than
mere
companions
or
pets
calhoun
got
a
for
the
banded
sun
it
could
hardly
be
an
accurate
measure
of
distance
but
it
was
a
guide
hold
on
to
something
murgatroyd
he
said
murgatroyd
watched
he
saw
calhoun
make
certain
gestures
which
presaged
discomfort
he
popped
back
into
his
cubbyhole
calhoun
threw
the
overdrive
switch
and
the
med
ship
flicked
back
into
that
questionable
state
of
being
in
which
velocities
of
hundreds
of
times
that
of
light
are
possible
the
sensation
of
going
into
overdrive
was
unpleasant
a
moment
later
the
sensation
of
coming
out
was
no
less
so
calhoun
had
experienced
it
often
enough
and
still
did
like
it
the
sun
weald
burned
huge
and
terrible
in
space
it
was
close
now
its
disk
covered
half
a
degree
of
arc
very
neat
observed
calhoun
weald
three
is
our
port
murgatroyd
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
would
be
hm
he
swung
the
outside
electron
telescope
picked
up
a
nearby
bright
object
enlarged
its
image
to
show
details
and
checked
it
against
the
local
he
calculated
a
moment
the
distance
was
too
short
for
even
the
briefest
of
overdrive
hops
but
it
would
take
time
to
get
there
on
drive
he
thumbed
down
the
communicator
button
and
spoke
into
a
microphone
med
ship
reporting
arrival
and
asking
coordinates
for
landing
he
said
purpose
of
landing
is
planetary
health
inspection
our
mass
is
fifty
tons
standard
we
should
arrive
at
a
landing
position
in
something
under
four
hours
repeat
med
ship
he
finished
the
regular
second
transmission
and
made
coffee
for
himself
while
he
waited
for
an
answer
murgatroyd
came
out
for
a
cup
of
coffee
for
himself
murgatroyd
adored
coffee
in
minutes
he
held
a
tiny
cup
in
a
furry
small
paw
and
sipped
gingerly
at
the
hot
liquid
a
voice
came
out
of
the
communicator
repeat
your
identification
calhoun
went
to
the
control
board
he
said
patiently
is
a
med
ship
sent
by
the
interstellar
medical
service
to
make
a
planetary
health
inspection
on
weald
check
with
your
public
health
authorities
this
is
the
first
med
ship
visit
in
twelve
standard
years
i
believe
which
is
inexcusable
but
your
health
authorities
will
know
all
about
it
check
with
them
the
voice
said
truculently
what
was
your
last
port
calhoun
named
it
this
was
not
his
home
sector
but
sector
twelve
had
gotten
into
a
very
bad
situation
some
of
its
planets
had
gone
unvisited
for
as
long
as
twenty
years
and
twelve
between
inspections
was
almost
commonplace
other
sectors
had
been
called
on
to
help
it
catch
up
calhoun
was
one
of
the
loaned
med
ship
men
and
because
of
the
emergency
he
been
given
a
list
of
half
a
dozen
planets
to
be
inspected
one
after
another
instead
of
reporting
back
to
sector
headquarters
after
each
visit
he
had
minor
troubles
before
with
operators
in
sector
twelve
so
he
was
very
patient
he
named
the
planet
last
inspected
the
one
from
which
he
set
out
for
weald
three
the
voice
from
the
communicator
said
sharply
what
port
before
that
calhoun
named
the
one
before
the
last
do
drive
any
closer
said
the
voice
harshly
or
you
be
destroyed
calhoun
said
coldly
listen
my
fine
feathered
friend
i
from
the
interstellar
medical
service
you
get
in
touch
with
planetary
health
services
immediately
remind
them
of
the
interstellar
medical
inspection
agreement
signed
on
tralee
two
hundred
and
forty
standard
years
ago
remind
them
that
if
they
do
not
cooperate
in
medical
inspection
that
i
can
put
your
planet
under
quarantine
and
your
space
commerce
will
be
cut
off
like
that
no
ship
will
be
cleared
for
weald
from
any
other
planet
in
the
galaxy
until
there
has
been
a
health
inspection
things
have
pretty
well
gone
to
pot
so
far
as
the
med
service
in
this
sector
is
concerned
but
being
straightened
up
i
helping
straighten
it
i
give
you
twenty
minutes
to
clear
this
then
i
am
coming
in
and
if
i
not
landed
a
quarantine
goes
on
tell
your
health
authorities
that
silence
calhoun
clicked
off
and
poured
himself
another
cup
of
coffee
murgatroyd
held
out
his
cup
for
a
refill
calhoun
gave
it
to
him
i
hate
to
put
on
an
official
hat
murgatroyd
he
said
annoyed
but
there
are
some
people
who
demand
it
the
rule
is
never
get
official
if
you
can
help
it
but
when
you
must
the
official
officialing
you
murgatroyd
said
and
sipped
at
his
cup
calhoun
checked
the
course
of
the
med
ship
it
bore
on
through
space
there
were
tiny
noises
from
the
communicator
there
were
whisperings
and
rustlings
and
the
occasional
strange
and
sometimes
beautiful
musical
notes
whose
origin
is
yet
obscure
but
which
since
they
are
carried
by
electromagnetic
radiation
of
wildly
varying
wave
lengths
are
not
likely
to
be
the
fabled
music
of
the
spheres
in
fifteen
minutes
a
different
voice
came
from
the
speaker
med
ship
med
ship
calhoun
answered
and
the
voice
said
anxiously
sorry
about
the
challenge
but
we
have
the
blueskin
problem
always
with
us
we
have
to
be
extremely
careful
will
you
come
in
please
i
on
my
way
said
calhoun
the
planetary
health
authorities
said
the
voice
more
anxiously
still
are
very
anxious
to
be
cooperative
we
need
med
service
help
we
lose
a
lot
of
sleep
over
the
blueskin
could
you
tell
us
the
name
of
the
last
med
ship
to
land
here
and
its
inspector
and
when
that
inspection
was
made
we
want
to
look
up
the
record
of
the
event
to
be
able
to
assist
you
in
every
possible
way
he
lying
calhoun
told
murgatroyd
but
he
more
scared
than
hostile
he
picked
up
the
order
folio
on
weald
three
he
gave
the
information
about
the
last
med
ship
visit
what
he
asked
is
a
blueskin
he
read
the
folio
on
weald
of
course
but
as
the
ship
swam
onward
through
emptiness
he
went
through
it
again
the
last
medical
inspection
had
been
only
perfunctory
twelve
years
earlier
instead
of
three
a
med
ship
had
landed
on
weald
there
had
been
official
conferences
with
health
officials
there
was
a
report
on
the
birth
rate
the
death
rate
the
anomaly
rate
and
a
breakdown
of
all
reported
communicable
diseases
but
that
was
all
there
were
no
special
comments
and
no
overall
picture
presently
calhoun
found
the
word
in
a
sector
dictionary
where
words
of
only
local
usage
were
to
be
found
colloquial
term
for
a
person
recovered
from
a
plague
which
left
large
patches
of
blue
pigment
irregularly
distributed
over
the
body
especially
inhabitants
of
dara
the
condition
is
said
to
be
caused
by
a
chronic
nonfatal
form
of
dara
plague
and
has
been
said
to
be
noninfectious
though
this
is
not
certain
the
etiology
of
dara
plague
has
not
been
worked
out
the
blueskin
condition
is
hereditary
but
not
a
genetic
modification
as
markings
appear
in
calhoun
puzzled
over
it
nobody
could
have
read
the
entire
sector
directory
even
with
unlimited
leisure
during
travel
between
solar
systems
calhoun
had
tried
but
now
he
went
laboriously
through
indices
and
while
the
ship
continued
to
travel
onward
he
found
no
other
reference
to
blueskins
he
looked
up
dara
it
was
listed
as
an
inhabited
planet
some
four
hundred
years
colonized
with
a
and
at
the
time
the
main
notice
was
written
out
a
flourishing
interstellar
commerce
but
there
was
a
memo
evidently
added
to
the
entry
in
some
change
of
editions
plague
special
license
from
med
service
is
required
for
that
was
all
absolutely
all
the
communicator
said
suavely
med
ship
come
in
on
vision
please
calhoun
went
to
the
control
board
and
threw
on
vision
well
what
now
he
demanded
his
screen
lighted
a
bland
face
looked
out
at
him
we
have
ah
verified
your
statements
said
the
third
voice
from
weald
just
one
more
item
are
you
alone
in
your
ship
of
course
said
calhoun
frowning
quite
alone
insisted
the
voice
obviously
said
calhoun
no
other
living
creature
insisted
the
voice
again
of
oh
said
calhoun
annoyed
he
called
over
his
shoulder
murgatroyd
come
here
murgatroyd
hopped
to
his
lap
and
gazed
interestedly
at
the
screen
the
bland
face
changed
remarkably
the
voice
changed
even
more
very
good
it
said
very
very
good
blueskins
do
not
have
you
are
med
service
by
all
means
come
in
your
coordinates
will
be
calhoun
wrote
them
down
he
clicked
off
the
communicator
again
and
growled
to
murgatroyd
so
i
might
have
been
a
blueskin
eh
and
you
my
passport
because
only
med
ships
have
members
of
your
tribe
aboard
what
the
hell
the
matter
murgatroyd
they
act
like
they
think
somebody
trying
to
get
down
on
their
planet
with
a
load
of
plague
germs
he
grumbled
to
himself
for
minutes
the
life
of
a
med
ship
man
is
not
exactly
a
sinecure
at
best
it
means
long
periods
in
empty
space
in
overdrive
which
is
absolute
and
deadly
tedium
then
two
or
three
days
aground
checking
official
documents
and
statistics
and
asking
questions
to
see
how
many
of
the
newest
medical
techniques
have
reached
this
planet
or
that
and
the
supplying
of
information
about
such
as
have
not
arrived
then
the
lifting
out
to
space
for
long
periods
of
tedium
to
repeat
the
process
somewhere
else
med
ships
carry
only
one
man
because
two
could
not
stand
the
close
contact
without
quarreling
with
each
other
but
med
ships
do
carry
like
murgatroyd
and
a
and
a
man
can
get
along
indefinitely
like
a
man
and
a
dog
it
is
a
highly
unequal
friendship
but
it
seems
to
be
satisfactory
to
both
calhoun
was
very
much
annoyed
with
the
way
the
med
service
had
been
operated
in
sector
twelve
he
was
one
of
many
men
at
work
to
correct
the
results
of
incompetence
in
directing
med
service
in
this
sector
but
it
is
always
disheartening
to
have
to
labor
at
making
up
for
somebody
else
blundering
when
there
is
so
much
new
work
that
needs
to
be
done
the
condition
shown
by
the
suspicions
was
a
case
in
point
blueskins
were
people
who
inherited
a
splotchy
skin
pigmentation
from
other
people
who
survived
a
plague
weald
plainly
maintained
a
quarantine
against
them
but
a
quarantine
is
normally
an
emergency
measure
the
med
service
should
have
taken
over
wiped
out
the
need
for
a
quarantine
and
then
lifted
it
it
been
done
calhoun
fumed
to
himself
the
world
of
weald
three
grew
brighter
and
brighter
and
became
a
disk
the
disk
had
icecaps
and
a
reasonable
proportion
of
land
and
water
surface
the
ship
decelerated
voices
notifying
observation
from
the
surface
and
the
little
ship
came
to
a
stop
some
five
planetary
diameters
out
from
solidity
the
landing
field
locked
on
to
it
and
its
descent
began
the
business
of
landing
was
all
very
familiar
from
the
blue
rim
which
appeared
at
the
limb
of
the
planet
from
one
diameter
out
to
the
singular
of
the
surface
features
as
the
ship
sank
still
lower
there
was
the
circular
rearing
skyward
for
nearly
a
mile
it
could
let
down
interstellar
liners
from
emptiness
and
lift
them
out
to
emptiness
again
with
great
convenience
and
economy
for
everyone
it
landed
the
med
ship
in
its
center
and
there
were
officials
to
greet
calhoun
and
he
knew
in
advance
the
routine
part
of
his
visit
there
would
be
an
interview
with
the
planet
chief
executive
by
whatever
title
he
was
called
there
would
be
a
banquet
murgatroyd
would
be
petted
by
everybody
there
would
be
painful
efforts
to
impress
calhoun
with
the
splendid
conduct
of
public
health
matters
on
weald
he
would
be
told
much
scandal
he
might
find
one
man
somewhere
who
passionately
labored
to
advance
the
welfare
of
his
fellow
humans
by
finding
out
how
to
keep
them
well
or
failing
that
how
to
make
them
well
when
they
got
sick
and
in
two
days
or
three
calhoun
would
be
escorted
back
to
the
and
lifted
out
to
space
and
he
spend
long
empty
days
in
overdrive
and
land
somewhere
else
to
do
the
whole
thing
all
over
again
it
all
happened
exactly
as
he
expected
with
one
exception
every
human
being
he
met
on
weald
wanted
to
talk
about
blueskins
blueskins
and
the
idea
of
blueskins
obsessed
everyone
calhoun
listened
without
asking
questions
until
he
had
the
picture
of
what
blueskins
meant
to
the
people
who
talked
of
them
then
he
knew
there
would
be
no
use
asking
questions
at
random
nobody
mentioned
ever
having
seen
a
blueskin
nobody
mentioned
a
specific
event
in
which
a
blueskin
had
at
any
named
time
taken
part
but
everybody
was
afraid
of
blueskins
it
was
a
patterned
an
inculcated
a
fixed
idea
and
it
found
expression
in
shocked
references
to
the
vileness
the
depravity
the
monstrousness
of
the
blueskin
inhabitants
of
dara
from
whom
weald
must
at
all
costs
be
protected
it
did
not
make
sense
so
calhoun
listened
politely
until
he
found
an
undistinguished
medical
man
who
wanted
some
special
information
about
gene
selection
as
practised
halfway
across
the
galaxy
he
invited
that
man
to
the
med
ship
where
he
supplied
the
information
not
hitherto
available
he
saw
his
guest
eyes
shine
a
little
with
that
joyous
awe
a
man
feels
when
he
finds
out
something
he
has
wanted
long
and
badly
to
know
now
said
calhoun
tell
me
something
why
does
everybody
on
this
planet
hate
the
inhabitants
of
dara
it
away
nobody
claims
to
have
suffered
in
person
from
them
why
make
a
point
of
hating
them
the
wealdian
doctor
grimaced
they
blue
patches
on
their
skins
they
different
from
us
so
they
can
be
pictured
as
a
danger
and
our
political
parties
can
make
an
election
issue
out
of
competing
for
the
privilege
of
defending
us
from
them
they
had
a
plague
on
dara
once
they
accused
of
still
having
it
ready
for
export
hm
said
calhoun
the
story
is
that
they
want
to
spread
contagion
here
eh
does
anybody
his
tone
was
sardonic
does
anybody
urge
that
they
be
massacred
as
an
act
of
piety
admitted
the
doctor
reluctantly
it
mentioned
in
political
speeches
but
how
it
rationalized
demanded
calhoun
what
the
argument
to
make
involve
moral
and
physical
degradation
as
assured
is
the
case
in
the
public
schools
said
the
doctor
the
children
are
taught
that
blueskins
are
now
carriers
of
the
disease
they
survived
three
generations
ago
that
they
hate
everybody
who
is
a
blueskin
that
they
are
constantly
scheming
to
introduce
their
plague
here
so
most
of
us
will
die
and
the
rest
will
become
blueskins
that
beyond
rationalizing
it
ca
be
true
but
it
not
safe
to
doubt
it
bad
business
said
calhoun
coldly
that
sort
of
thing
usually
costs
lives
in
the
end
it
could
lead
to
massacre
perhaps
it
has
in
a
way
said
the
doctor
unhappily
one
like
to
think
about
it
he
paused
twenty
years
ago
there
was
a
famine
on
dara
there
were
crop
failures
the
situation
must
have
been
very
bad
they
built
a
spaceship
they
no
use
for
such
things
normally
because
no
nearby
planet
will
deal
with
them
or
let
them
land
but
they
built
a
spaceship
and
came
here
they
went
in
orbit
around
weald
they
asked
to
trade
for
shiploads
of
food
they
offered
any
price
in
heavy
metals
gold
platinum
irridium
and
so
on
they
talked
from
orbit
by
vision
communicators
they
could
be
seen
to
be
blueskins
you
can
guess
what
happened
tell
me
said
calhoun
we
armed
ships
in
a
hurry
admitted
the
doctor
we
chased
their
spaceship
back
to
dara
we
hung
in
space
off
the
planet
we
told
them
we
blast
their
world
from
pole
to
pole
if
they
ever
dared
take
to
space
again
we
made
them
destroy
their
one
ship
and
we
watched
on
visionscreens
as
it
was
done
but
you
gave
them
food
no
said
the
doctor
ashamedly
they
were
blueskins
how
bad
was
the
famine
who
knows
any
number
may
have
starved
and
we
kept
a
squadron
of
armed
ships
in
their
skies
for
years
to
keep
them
from
spreading
the
plague
we
said
and
some
of
us
believed
it
the
doctor
tone
was
purest
irony
lately
he
said
there
been
a
move
for
economy
in
our
government
simultaneously
we
began
to
have
a
series
of
overabundant
crops
the
government
had
to
buy
the
excess
grain
to
keep
the
price
up
retired
patrol
ships
built
to
watch
over
dara
were
available
for
storage
space
we
filled
them
up
with
grain
and
sent
them
out
into
orbit
they
there
now
hundreds
of
thousands
or
millions
of
tons
of
grain
and
dara
the
doctor
shrugged
he
stood
up
our
hatred
of
dara
he
said
again
ironically
has
produced
one
thing
roughly
halfway
between
here
and
dara
there
a
solar
system
orede
there
a
usable
planet
there
it
was
proposed
to
build
an
outpost
of
weald
there
against
blueskins
cattle
were
landed
to
run
wild
and
multiply
and
make
a
reason
for
colonists
to
settle
there
they
did
but
nobody
wants
to
move
near
to
blueskins
so
orede
stayed
uninhabited
until
a
hunting
party
shooting
wild
cattle
found
an
outcropping
of
ore
so
now
there
a
mine
there
and
that
all
a
few
hundred
men
work
the
mine
at
fabulous
wages
you
may
be
asked
to
check
on
their
health
but
not
dara
i
see
said
calhoun
frowning
the
doctor
moved
toward
the
med
ship
exit
port
i
answered
your
questions
he
said
grimly
but
if
i
talked
to
anyone
else
as
i
done
to
you
i
be
lucky
only
to
be
driven
into
exile
i
sha
give
you
away
said
calhoun
he
did
not
smile
when
the
doctor
had
gone
calhoun
said
deliberately
murgatroyd
you
should
be
grateful
that
you
a
and
not
a
man
nothing
about
being
a
to
make
you
ashamed
then
he
grimly
changed
his
garments
for
the
uniform
of
the
med
service
there
was
to
be
a
banquet
at
which
he
would
sit
next
to
the
planet
chief
executive
and
hear
innumerable
speeches
about
the
splendor
of
weald
calhoun
had
his
own
strictly
med
service
opinion
of
the
planet
latest
and
most
achievement
it
was
a
domed
city
in
the
polar
regions
where
nobody
ever
had
to
go
outdoors
he
was
less
than
professionally
enthusiastic
about
the
moving
streets
and
much
less
than
approving
of
the
dream
broadcasts
which
supplied
hypnotic
rhythms
to
anybody
who
chose
to
listen
to
them
the
price
was
that
while
asleep
one
would
hear
high
praise
of
commercial
products
and
might
believe
them
when
awake
but
it
was
not
calhoun
function
to
criticize
when
it
could
be
avoided
med
service
had
been
badly
managed
in
sector
twelve
so
at
the
banquet
calhoun
made
a
brief
and
diplomatic
address
in
which
he
temperately
praised
what
could
be
praised
and
did
not
mention
anything
else
the
chief
executive
followed
him
as
head
of
the
government
he
paid
some
tribute
to
the
med
service
but
then
he
reminded
his
hearers
proudly
of
the
high
culture
splendid
health
and
remarkable
prosperity
of
the
planet
since
his
political
party
took
office
this
he
said
despite
the
need
to
be
perpetually
on
guard
against
the
greatest
and
most
immediate
danger
to
which
any
world
in
all
the
galaxy
was
exposed
he
referred
to
the
blueskins
of
course
he
did
not
need
to
tell
the
people
of
weald
what
vigilance
what
constant
watchfulness
was
necessary
against
that
race
of
deprived
and
malevolent
deviants
from
the
norm
of
humanity
but
weald
he
said
with
emotion
held
aloft
the
torch
of
all
that
humanity
held
most
dear
and
defended
not
alone
the
lives
of
its
people
against
blueskin
contagion
but
their
noble
heritage
of
ideals
against
blueskin
pollution
when
he
sat
down
calhoun
said
very
politely
it
looks
as
if
some
day
it
should
be
practical
politics
to
urge
the
massacre
of
all
blueskins
have
you
thought
of
that
the
chief
executive
said
comfortably
the
idea
been
proposed
good
politics
to
urge
it
but
it
would
be
foolish
to
carry
it
out
people
vote
against
blueskins
wipe
them
out
and
where
you
be
calhoun
ground
his
teeth
quietly
there
were
more
speeches
then
a
messenger
arrived
with
a
written
note
for
the
chief
executive
he
read
it
and
passed
it
to
calhoun
it
was
from
the
ministry
of
health
the
spaceport
reported
that
a
ship
had
just
broken
out
from
overdrive
within
the
wealdian
solar
system
its
had
automatically
signaled
its
arrival
from
the
mining
planet
orede
but
having
sent
off
its
automatic
signal
the
ship
lay
dead
in
space
it
did
not
drive
toward
weald
it
did
not
respond
to
signals
it
drifted
like
a
derelict
upon
no
course
at
all
it
seemed
ominous
and
since
it
came
from
orede
the
planet
nearest
to
dara
of
the
blueskins
the
health
ministry
informed
the
planet
chief
executive
it
be
blueskins
said
that
astute
person
firmly
they
next
door
to
orede
that
who
done
this
it
would
surprise
me
if
they
seeded
orede
with
their
plague
and
this
ship
came
from
there
to
give
us
warning
there
no
evidence
for
anything
of
the
sort
protested
calhoun
a
ship
simply
came
out
of
overdrive
and
did
signal
further
all
we
see
said
the
chief
executive
ominously
we
go
to
the
spaceport
there
we
get
the
news
as
it
comes
in
and
can
frame
orders
on
the
latest
information
he
took
calhoun
by
the
arm
calhoun
said
sharply
murgatroyd
during
the
banquet
murgatroyd
had
been
visiting
with
the
wives
of
the
officials
they
had
enough
of
their
husbands
normally
without
listening
to
their
official
speeches
murgatroyd
was
brought
his
small
paunch
distended
with
cakes
and
coffee
and
such
delicacies
as
he
been
plied
with
he
was
half
comatose
from
overfeeding
and
overpetting
but
he
was
glad
to
see
calhoun
calhoun
held
the
little
creature
in
his
arms
as
the
official
groundcar
raced
through
traffic
with
screaming
sirens
claiming
the
right
of
way
it
reached
the
spaceport
where
enormous
metal
girders
formed
a
monster
frame
of
metal
lace
against
a
sky
the
chief
executive
strode
magnificently
into
the
spaceport
offices
there
was
no
news
the
situation
remained
unchanged
a
ship
from
orede
had
come
out
of
overdrive
and
lay
dead
in
emptiness
it
did
not
answer
calls
it
did
not
move
in
space
it
floated
eerily
in
no
orbit
going
nowhere
doing
nothing
and
panic
was
the
consequence
it
seemed
to
calhoun
that
the
official
handling
of
the
matter
accounted
for
the
terror
that
he
could
feel
building
up
the
unexplained
bit
of
news
was
on
the
air
all
over
the
planet
weald
there
was
nobody
awake
of
all
the
world
population
who
did
not
believe
that
there
was
a
new
danger
in
the
sky
nobody
doubted
that
it
came
from
blueskins
the
treatment
of
the
news
was
precisely
calculated
to
keep
alive
the
hatred
of
weald
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
dara
calhoun
put
murgatroyd
into
the
med
ship
and
went
back
to
the
spaceport
office
a
small
spaceboat
designed
to
inspect
the
circling
grain
ships
from
time
to
time
was
already
aloft
the
had
thrust
it
swiftly
out
most
of
the
way
now
it
droned
and
drove
on
sturdily
toward
the
enigmatic
ship
calhoun
took
no
part
in
the
agitated
conferences
among
the
officials
and
news
reporters
at
the
spaceport
but
he
listened
to
the
talk
about
him
as
the
investigating
small
ship
drew
nearer
to
the
cargo
vessel
the
guesses
about
the
meaning
of
its
breakout
and
following
silence
grew
more
and
more
wild
but
singularly
there
was
no
single
suggestion
that
the
mystery
might
not
be
the
work
of
blueskins
blueskins
were
for
all
the
fears
and
all
the
uneasiness
a
perhaps
world
developed
presently
the
investigating
spaceboat
reached
the
mystery
ship
and
circled
it
beaming
queries
no
answer
it
reported
the
cargo
ship
dark
no
lights
anywhere
on
or
in
it
there
were
no
from
even
pulsing
idling
engines
delicately
the
messenger
craft
maneuvered
until
it
touched
the
silent
vessel
it
reported
that
microphones
detected
no
motion
whatever
inside
let
a
volunteer
go
aboard
commanded
the
chief
executive
let
him
report
what
he
finds
a
pause
then
the
solemn
announcement
of
an
intrepid
volunteer
name
from
far
far
away
calhoun
listened
frowning
darkly
this
pompous
heroism
would
be
noticed
in
the
med
service
it
would
be
routine
behavior
suspenseful
reports
the
volunteer
had
rocketed
himself
across
the
emptiness
between
the
two
again
separated
ships
he
had
opened
the
airlock
from
outside
he
gone
in
he
closed
the
outer
airlock
door
he
opened
the
inner
he
reported
the
relayed
report
was
almost
incoherent
what
with
horror
and
incredulity
and
the
feeling
of
doom
that
came
upon
the
volunteer
the
ship
was
a
designed
to
run
between
orede
and
weald
with
cargos
of
ores
and
a
crew
of
no
more
than
five
men
there
was
no
cargo
in
her
holds
now
though
instead
there
were
men
they
packed
the
ship
they
filled
the
corridors
they
had
crawled
into
every
space
where
a
man
could
find
room
to
push
himself
there
were
hundreds
of
them
it
was
insanity
and
it
had
been
greater
insanity
still
for
the
ship
to
have
taken
off
with
so
preposterous
a
load
of
living
creatures
but
they
were
living
any
longer
the
air
apparatus
had
been
designed
for
a
crew
of
five
it
would
purify
the
air
for
possibly
twenty
or
more
but
there
were
hundreds
of
men
in
hiding
as
well
as
in
plain
view
in
the
cargo
ship
from
orede
there
were
many
many
times
more
than
her
air
apparatus
and
reserve
tanks
could
possibly
have
taken
care
of
they
could
even
have
been
fed
during
the
journey
from
orede
to
weald
but
they
had
starved
killed
them
before
the
ship
came
out
of
overdrive
a
remarkable
thing
was
that
there
was
no
written
message
in
the
log
which
referred
to
its
takeoff
there
was
no
memorandum
of
the
taking
on
of
such
an
impossible
number
of
passengers
the
blueskins
did
it
said
the
chief
executive
of
weald
he
was
pale
all
about
calhoun
men
looked
sick
and
shocked
and
terrified
it
was
the
blueskins
we
have
to
teach
them
a
lesson
then
he
turned
to
calhoun
the
volunteer
who
went
on
that
ship
he
have
to
stay
there
wo
he
he
ca
be
brought
back
to
weald
without
bringing
contagion
calhoun
raged
at
him
there
was
a
certain
coldness
in
the
manner
of
those
at
the
weald
spaceport
when
the
med
ship
left
next
morning
calhoun
was
not
popular
because
weald
was
scared
it
had
been
conditioned
to
scare
easily
where
blueskins
might
be
involved
its
children
were
trained
to
react
explosively
when
the
word
was
uttered
in
their
hearing
and
its
adults
tended
to
say
it
when
anything
causing
uneasiness
entered
their
minds
so
a
habit
of
irrational
response
had
formed
and
was
not
seen
to
be
irrational
because
almost
everybody
had
it
the
volunteer
who
discovered
the
tragedy
on
the
ship
from
orede
was
safe
though
he
made
a
completely
conscientious
survey
of
the
ship
he
volunteered
to
enter
and
examine
for
his
courage
he
have
been
doomed
but
for
calhoun
the
reaction
of
his
fellow
citizens
was
that
by
entering
the
ship
he
might
have
become
contaminated
by
blueskin
infectious
material
of
the
plague
still
existed
and
the
men
in
the
ship
had
caught
it
but
they
certainly
had
died
of
it
and
there
had
been
blueskins
on
orede
to
communicate
it
for
which
there
was
no
evidence
and
blueskins
were
responsible
for
the
tragedy
which
was
at
the
moment
pure
supposition
but
weald
feared
he
might
bring
death
back
to
weald
if
he
were
allowed
to
return
calhoun
saved
his
life
he
ordered
that
the
guardship
admit
him
to
its
airlock
which
then
was
to
be
filled
with
steam
and
chlorine
the
combination
would
sterilize
and
even
partly
eat
away
his
spacesuit
after
which
the
chlorine
and
steam
should
be
bled
out
to
space
and
air
from
the
ship
let
into
the
lock
if
he
stripped
off
the
spacesuit
without
touching
its
outer
surface
and
reentered
the
investigating
ship
while
the
suit
was
flung
outside
by
a
man
in
another
spacesuit
handling
it
with
a
pole
he
fling
after
it
there
could
be
no
possible
contamination
brought
back
calhoun
was
quite
right
but
weald
in
general
considered
that
persuaded
the
government
to
take
an
unreasonable
risk
there
were
other
reasons
for
disapproving
of
him
calhoun
had
been
unpleasantly
frank
the
coming
of
the
stirred
to
frenzy
those
people
who
believed
that
all
blueskins
should
be
exterminated
as
a
pious
act
they
appeared
on
every
vision
screen
citing
not
only
the
ship
from
orede
but
other
incidents
which
they
interpreted
as
crimes
against
weald
they
demanded
that
all
wealdian
atomic
reactors
be
modified
to
turn
out
materials
while
a
space
fleet
was
made
ready
for
an
crusade
they
confidently
demanded
such
a
rain
of
fusion
bombs
on
dara
that
no
blueskin
no
animal
no
shred
of
vegetation
no
fish
in
the
deepest
ocean
not
even
a
living
virus
particle
of
the
blueskin
plague
could
remain
alive
on
the
blueskin
world
one
of
these
vehement
orators
even
asserted
that
calhoun
agreed
that
no
other
course
was
possible
speaking
for
the
interstellar
medical
service
and
calhoun
furiously
demanded
a
chance
to
deny
it
by
broadcast
and
he
made
a
bitter
and
indiscreet
speech
from
which
a
audience
inferred
that
he
thought
them
fools
he
did
so
he
was
definitely
unpopular
when
his
ship
lifted
from
weald
curtly
given
his
destination
as
orede
from
which
the
had
come
the
locked
on
raised
the
small
spacecraft
until
weald
was
a
great
shining
ball
below
it
and
then
somehow
scornfully
cast
him
off
the
med
ship
was
free
in
clear
space
where
there
was
not
enough
of
a
gravitational
field
to
hinder
overdrive
he
aimed
for
his
destination
his
face
very
grim
he
said
savagely
get
set
murgatroyd
overdrive
coming
he
thumbed
down
the
overdrive
button
the
universe
of
stars
went
out
while
everything
living
in
the
ship
felt
the
customary
sensations
of
dizziness
of
nausea
and
of
a
spiraling
fall
to
nothingness
then
there
was
silence
the
med
ship
actually
moved
at
a
rate
which
was
a
preposterous
number
of
times
the
speed
of
light
but
it
felt
absolutely
solid
absolutely
firm
and
fixed
a
ship
in
overdrive
feels
exactly
as
if
it
were
buried
deep
in
the
core
of
a
planet
there
is
no
vibration
there
is
no
sign
of
anything
but
solidity
and
if
one
looks
out
a
port
there
is
only
utter
blackness
plus
an
absence
of
sound
fit
to
make
one
eardrums
crack
but
within
seconds
random
tiny
noises
began
there
was
a
reel
and
there
were
to
keep
the
ship
from
sounding
like
a
grave
the
reel
played
and
the
speakers
gave
off
minute
creakings
and
meaningless
hums
and
very
tiny
noises
of
every
imaginable
sort
all
of
which
were
just
above
the
threshold
of
the
inaudible
calhoun
fretted
sector
twelve
was
in
very
bad
shape
a
conscientious
med
service
man
would
never
have
let
the
obsession
go
unmentioned
in
a
report
on
weald
health
is
not
only
a
physical
affair
there
is
mental
health
also
when
mental
health
goes
a
civilization
can
be
destroyed
more
surely
and
more
terribly
than
by
any
imaginable
war
or
plague
germs
a
plague
kills
off
those
who
are
susceptible
to
it
leaving
immunes
to
build
up
a
world
again
but
immunes
are
the
first
to
be
killed
when
a
mass
neurosis
sweeps
a
population
weald
was
definitely
a
med
service
problem
world
dara
was
another
and
when
hundreds
of
men
jammed
themselves
into
a
cargo
spaceship
which
could
not
furnish
them
with
air
to
breathe
and
took
off
and
went
into
overdrive
before
the
air
could
fail
orede
called
for
no
less
of
worry
i
think
said
calhoun
dourly
that
i
have
some
coffee
was
one
of
the
words
that
murgatroyd
recognized
ordinarily
he
stirred
immediately
on
hearing
it
and
watched
the
coffeemaker
with
bright
interested
eyes
he
even
tried
to
imitate
calhoun
motions
with
it
once
and
had
scorched
his
paws
in
the
attempt
but
this
time
he
did
not
move
calhoun
turned
his
head
murgatroyd
sat
on
the
floor
his
long
tail
coiled
reflectively
about
a
chair
leg
he
watched
the
door
of
the
med
ship
sleeping
cabin
murgatroyd
said
calhoun
i
mentioned
coffee
shrilled
murgatroyd
but
he
continued
to
look
at
the
door
the
temperature
was
kept
lower
in
the
other
cabin
and
the
look
of
things
was
different
than
the
control
compartment
the
difference
was
part
of
the
means
by
which
a
man
was
able
to
be
alone
for
weeks
on
end
alone
save
for
his
without
becoming
there
were
other
carefully
thought
out
items
in
the
ship
with
the
same
purpose
but
none
of
them
should
cause
murgatroyd
to
stare
fixedly
and
fascinatedly
at
the
sleeping
cabin
door
not
when
coffee
was
in
the
making
calhoun
considered
he
became
angry
at
the
immediate
suspicion
that
occurred
to
him
as
a
med
service
man
he
was
to
be
impartial
to
be
impartial
might
mean
not
to
side
absolutely
with
weald
in
its
enmity
to
blueskins
and
the
people
of
weald
had
refused
to
help
dara
in
a
time
of
famine
and
had
blockaded
that
pariah
world
for
years
afterward
and
they
had
other
reasons
for
hating
the
people
they
treated
badly
it
was
entirely
reasonable
for
some
fanatic
on
weald
to
consider
that
calhoun
must
be
killed
lest
he
be
of
help
to
the
blueskins
weald
abhorred
in
fact
it
was
quite
possible
that
somebody
had
stowed
away
on
the
med
ship
to
murder
calhoun
so
that
there
would
be
no
danger
of
any
report
favorable
to
dara
ever
being
presented
anywhere
if
so
such
a
stowaway
would
be
in
the
sleeping
cabin
now
waiting
for
calhoun
to
walk
in
unsuspiciously
only
to
be
shot
dead
so
calhoun
made
coffee
he
slipped
a
blaster
into
a
pocket
where
it
would
be
handy
he
filled
a
small
cup
for
murgatroyd
and
a
large
one
for
himself
and
then
a
second
large
one
he
tapped
on
the
sleeping
cabin
door
standing
aside
lest
a
come
through
it
coffee
ready
he
said
sardonically
come
out
and
join
us
there
was
a
long
pause
calhoun
rapped
again
you
a
seat
at
the
captain
table
he
said
more
sardonically
still
it
not
polite
to
keep
me
waiting
he
listened
alert
for
a
rush
which
would
be
a
fanatic
desperate
attempt
to
do
murder
despite
premature
discovery
he
was
prepared
to
shoot
quite
ruthlessly
because
he
was
on
duty
and
the
med
service
did
not
approve
of
the
extermination
of
populations
however
justified
another
population
might
consider
it
but
there
was
no
rush
instead
there
came
hesitant
whose
sound
made
calhoun
start
the
door
of
the
cabin
slid
slowly
aside
a
girl
appeared
in
the
opening
desperately
white
and
desperately
composed
did
you
know
i
was
there
she
asked
shakily
she
moistened
her
lips
you
did
see
me
i
was
in
a
closet
and
you
did
even
enter
the
room
calhoun
said
grimly
i
sources
of
information
murgatroyd
told
me
this
time
may
i
present
him
murgatroyd
our
passenger
shake
hands
murgatroyd
moved
forward
stood
on
his
hind
legs
and
offered
a
skinny
furry
paw
she
did
not
move
she
stared
at
calhoun
better
shake
hands
said
calhoun
as
grimly
as
before
it
might
relax
the
tension
a
little
and
do
you
want
to
tell
me
your
story
you
have
one
ready
i
sure
the
girl
swallowed
murgatroyd
shook
hands
gravely
he
said
in
the
shrillest
of
trebles
and
went
back
to
his
former
position
the
story
said
calhoun
insistently
there
there
is
any
said
the
girl
unsteadily
just
that
i
i
need
to
get
to
orede
and
you
going
there
there
no
other
way
to
go
now
to
the
contrary
said
calhoun
there
undoubtedly
be
a
fleet
heading
for
orede
as
soon
as
it
can
be
assembled
and
armed
but
afraid
that
as
a
story
yours
is
good
enough
try
another
she
shivered
a
little
i
running
away
ah
said
calhoun
in
that
case
i
take
you
back
no
she
said
fiercely
i
i
die
first
i
wreck
this
ship
first
her
hand
came
from
behind
her
there
was
a
tiny
blaster
in
it
but
it
shook
visibly
as
she
tried
to
aim
it
i
shoot
out
the
controls
calhoun
blinked
he
had
to
make
a
drastic
change
in
his
estimate
of
the
situation
the
instant
he
saw
that
the
stowaway
was
a
girl
now
he
had
to
make
another
when
her
threat
was
not
to
kill
him
but
to
disable
the
ship
women
are
rarely
assassins
and
when
they
are
they
do
use
energy
weapons
daggers
and
poisons
are
more
typical
but
this
girl
threatened
to
destroy
the
ship
rather
than
its
owner
so
she
was
not
actually
an
assassin
at
all
i
rather
you
did
do
that
said
calhoun
dryly
besides
get
deadly
bored
if
we
were
stuck
in
a
derelict
waiting
for
our
air
and
food
to
give
out
murgatroyd
for
no
reason
whatever
felt
it
necessary
to
enter
the
conversation
a
very
sensible
suggestion
observed
calhoun
we
sit
down
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee
to
the
girl
he
said
i
take
you
to
orede
since
that
where
you
say
you
want
to
go
i
have
a
sweetheart
there
calhoun
shook
his
head
no
he
said
reprovingly
nearly
all
the
mining
colony
had
packed
itself
into
the
ship
that
came
into
weald
with
everybody
dead
but
not
all
and
there
been
no
check
of
what
men
were
in
the
ship
and
what
men
were
you
would
go
to
orede
if
it
were
likely
your
sweetheart
had
died
on
the
way
to
you
here
your
coffee
sugar
or
saccho
and
do
you
take
cream
she
trembled
a
little
but
she
took
the
cup
i
do
understand
murgatroyd
and
i
explained
calhoun
and
he
did
not
know
whether
he
spoke
out
of
anger
or
something
else
we
are
we
go
around
trying
to
keep
people
from
getting
sick
or
dying
sometimes
we
even
try
to
keep
them
from
getting
killed
it
our
profession
we
practise
it
even
on
our
own
behalf
we
want
to
stay
alive
so
since
you
make
such
drastic
threats
we
will
take
you
where
you
want
to
go
especially
since
we
going
there
anyhow
you
do
believe
anything
i
said
it
was
a
statement
not
a
word
admitted
calhoun
but
you
probably
tell
us
something
more
believable
presently
when
did
you
eat
last
yesterday
would
you
rather
do
your
own
cooking
asked
calhoun
politely
or
would
you
permit
me
to
ready
a
snack
i
i
do
it
she
said
she
drank
her
coffee
first
however
and
then
calhoun
showed
her
how
to
punch
the
readier
for
dishes
to
be
extracted
from
storage
and
warmed
or
chilled
as
the
case
might
be
and
served
at
intervals
there
was
also
equipment
for
preparing
food
for
oneself
in
one
own
chosen
manner
again
an
item
to
help
make
solitude
not
unendurable
calhoun
deliberately
immersed
himself
in
the
galactic
directory
looking
up
the
planet
orede
he
was
headed
there
but
he
had
no
reason
to
inform
himself
about
it
before
now
he
read
with
every
appearance
of
absorption
the
girl
ate
daintily
murgatroyd
watched
with
highly
amiable
interest
but
she
looked
acutely
uncomfortable
calhoun
finished
with
the
directory
he
got
out
the
reels
which
contained
more
information
he
was
specifically
after
the
med
service
history
of
all
the
planets
in
this
sector
he
went
through
the
filmed
record
of
every
inspection
ever
made
on
weald
and
on
dara
but
sector
twelve
had
not
been
run
well
there
was
no
adequate
account
of
a
plague
which
had
wiped
out
of
the
population
of
an
inhabited
planet
it
had
happened
shortly
after
one
med
ship
visit
and
was
over
before
another
med
ship
came
by
there
should
have
been
a
painstaking
investigation
even
after
the
fact
there
should
have
been
a
collection
of
infectious
material
and
a
reasonably
complete
identification
and
study
of
the
agent
it
been
made
there
was
probably
some
other
emergency
at
the
time
and
it
slipped
by
calhoun
whose
career
was
not
to
be
spent
in
this
sector
resolved
on
a
blistering
report
about
this
negligence
and
its
consequences
he
kept
himself
casually
busy
ignoring
the
girl
a
med
ship
man
has
resources
of
study
and
meditation
with
which
to
occupy
himself
during
overdrive
travel
from
one
planet
to
another
calhoun
made
use
of
those
resources
he
acted
as
if
he
were
completely
unconscious
of
the
stowaway
but
murgatroyd
watched
her
with
charmed
attention
hours
after
her
discovery
she
said
uneasily
please
calhoun
looked
up
yes
i
do
know
exactly
how
things
stand
you
are
a
stowaway
said
calhoun
legally
i
have
the
right
to
put
you
out
the
airlock
it
does
seem
necessary
there
a
cabin
when
you
sleepy
use
it
murgatroyd
and
i
can
make
out
quite
well
out
here
when
you
hungry
you
now
know
how
to
get
something
to
eat
when
we
land
on
orede
you
probably
go
about
whatever
business
you
have
there
that
all
she
stared
at
him
but
you
do
believe
what
i
told
you
no
agreed
calhoun
but
did
add
to
the
statement
but
i
will
tell
you
she
offered
the
police
were
after
me
i
had
to
get
away
from
weald
i
had
to
i
stolen
he
shook
his
head
no
he
said
if
you
were
a
thief
you
say
anything
in
the
world
except
that
you
were
a
thief
you
not
ready
to
tell
the
truth
yet
you
do
have
to
so
why
tell
me
anything
i
suggest
that
you
get
some
sleep
incidentally
there
no
lock
on
the
cabin
door
because
there
only
supposed
to
be
one
person
on
this
ship
at
a
time
but
you
can
brace
a
chair
to
fasten
it
somehow
or
other
good
night
she
rose
slowly
twice
her
lips
parted
as
if
to
speak
again
but
then
she
went
into
the
other
cabin
and
closed
herself
in
there
was
the
sound
of
a
chair
being
wedged
against
the
door
murgatroyd
blinked
at
the
place
where
she
disappeared
and
then
climbed
up
into
calhoun
lap
with
complete
assurance
of
welcome
he
settled
himself
and
was
silent
for
moments
then
he
said
i
believe
you
right
said
calhoun
she
does
belong
on
weald
or
with
the
conditioning
she
have
had
there
be
only
one
place
she
dread
worse
than
orede
which
would
be
dara
but
i
doubt
be
afraid
to
land
even
on
dara
murgatroyd
liked
to
be
talked
to
he
liked
to
pretend
that
he
carried
on
a
conversation
like
humans
he
said
with
conviction
definitely
agreed
calhoun
she
not
doing
this
for
her
personal
advantage
whatever
she
thinks
she
doing
it
more
important
to
her
than
her
own
life
murgatroyd
said
murgatroyd
in
an
inquiring
tone
there
are
wild
cattle
on
orede
said
calhoun
herds
and
herds
of
them
i
have
a
suspicion
that
somebody
been
shooting
them
lots
of
them
do
you
agree
do
you
think
that
a
lot
of
cattle
have
been
slaughtered
on
orede
lately
murgatroyd
yawned
he
settled
himself
still
more
comfortably
in
calhoun
lap
he
said
drowsily
he
went
to
sleep
while
calhoun
continued
the
examination
of
highly
condensed
information
presently
he
looked
up
the
normal
rate
of
increase
with
other
data
among
herds
of
in
a
wild
state
on
planets
where
there
are
no
natural
enemies
it
was
for
a
world
to
be
stocked
with
useful
types
of
terran
fauna
and
flora
before
it
was
attempted
to
be
colonized
terran
could
play
the
devil
with
alien
ecological
systems
very
much
to
humanity
benefit
familiar
microorganisms
and
a
standard
vegetation
added
to
the
practicality
of
human
settlements
on
otherwise
alien
worlds
but
sometimes
the
results
were
strange
they
were
often
so
strange
however
as
to
cause
some
hundreds
of
men
to
pack
themselves
frantically
aboard
a
cargo
ship
which
possibly
sustain
them
so
that
every
man
must
die
while
the
ship
was
in
overdrive
still
by
the
time
calhoun
turned
in
on
a
spare
pneumatic
mattress
he
had
calculated
that
as
few
as
a
dozen
head
of
cattle
turned
loose
on
a
suitable
planet
would
have
increased
to
herds
of
thousands
or
tens
or
even
hundreds
of
thousands
in
much
less
time
than
had
probably
elapsed
the
med
ship
drove
on
in
seemingly
absolute
solidity
with
no
sound
from
without
with
no
sight
to
be
seen
outside
with
no
evidence
at
all
that
it
was
not
buried
in
the
heart
of
a
planet
instead
of
flashing
through
emptiness
at
a
speed
so
great
as
to
have
no
meaning
next
the
girl
looked
oddly
at
calhoun
when
she
appeared
in
the
control
room
murgatroyd
regarded
her
with
great
interest
calhoun
nodded
politely
and
went
back
to
what
he
been
doing
before
she
appeared
shall
i
have
breakfast
she
asked
uncertainly
murgatroyd
and
i
have
he
told
her
why
not
silently
she
operated
the
she
ate
calhoun
gave
a
very
good
portrayal
of
a
man
who
will
respond
politely
when
spoken
to
but
who
was
busy
with
activities
remote
from
stowaways
about
noon
she
asked
when
will
we
get
to
orede
calhoun
told
her
absently
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
something
else
what
what
do
you
think
happened
there
i
mean
to
make
that
tragedy
in
the
ship
i
do
know
said
calhoun
but
i
disagree
with
the
authorities
on
weald
i
do
think
it
was
a
planned
atrocity
of
the
blueskins
are
blueskins
asked
the
girl
calhoun
turned
around
and
looked
at
her
directly
when
lying
he
said
mildly
you
tell
as
much
by
what
you
pretend
is
as
by
what
you
pretend
is
you
know
what
blueskins
are
but
what
do
you
think
they
are
she
asked
there
used
to
be
a
human
disease
called
smallpox
said
calhoun
when
people
recovered
from
it
they
were
usually
marked
their
skin
had
little
scar
pits
here
and
there
at
one
time
back
on
earth
it
was
expected
that
everybody
would
catch
smallpox
sooner
or
later
and
a
large
percentage
would
die
of
it
and
it
was
so
much
a
matter
of
course
that
if
they
printed
a
picture
of
a
criminal
they
never
mentioned
it
if
he
were
it
was
no
distinction
but
if
he
did
have
the
markings
they
mention
that
he
paused
those
were
hereditary
but
otherwise
a
blueskin
is
like
a
man
who
had
them
he
ca
be
anything
else
then
you
think
they
human
there
never
yet
been
a
case
of
reverse
evolution
said
calhoun
maybe
pithecanthropus
had
a
monkey
uncle
but
no
pithecanthropus
ever
went
monkey
she
turned
abruptly
away
but
she
glanced
at
him
often
during
that
day
he
continued
to
busy
himself
with
those
activities
which
make
med
ship
life
consistent
with
retained
sanity
next
day
she
asked
without
preliminary
do
you
believe
the
blueskins
planned
for
the
ship
with
the
dead
men
to
arrive
at
weald
and
spread
plague
there
no
said
calhoun
why
it
could
possibly
work
calhoun
told
her
with
only
dead
men
on
board
the
ship
would
arrive
at
a
place
where
the
could
bring
it
down
so
that
would
be
no
good
and
living
men
would
try
to
conceal
that
they
had
the
plague
they
might
ask
for
help
but
they
know
they
instantly
be
killed
on
weald
if
they
were
found
to
be
plague
victims
so
that
would
be
no
good
either
no
the
ship
was
intended
to
land
plague
on
weald
are
you
friendly
to
blueskins
she
asked
uncertainly
within
reason
said
calhoun
i
am
a
to
all
the
human
race
you
slipping
though
when
using
the
word
you
should
say
it
uncomfortably
as
if
it
were
a
word
no
refined
person
liked
to
pronounce
you
do
we
land
on
orede
tomorrow
by
the
way
if
you
ever
intend
to
tell
me
the
truth
there
not
much
time
left
she
bit
her
lips
twice
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
she
faced
him
and
opened
her
mouth
as
if
to
speak
and
then
turned
away
again
calhoun
shrugged
he
had
fairly
definite
ideas
about
her
by
now
he
carefully
kept
them
tentative
but
no
girl
born
and
raised
on
weald
would
willingly
go
to
orede
with
all
of
weald
believing
that
a
shipload
of
miners
preferred
death
to
remaining
there
it
tied
in
like
everything
else
that
was
unpleasant
to
blueskins
nobody
from
weald
would
dream
of
landing
on
orede
not
now
a
little
before
the
med
ship
was
due
to
break
out
from
overdrive
the
girl
said
very
carefully
you
been
very
kind
i
like
to
thank
you
i
i
did
really
believe
i
would
live
to
get
to
orede
calhoun
raised
his
eyebrows
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
everything
you
want
to
know
she
added
regretfully
i
think
you
really
decent
but
some
thing
calhoun
said
caustically
you
told
me
a
great
deal
you
born
on
weald
you
were
raised
there
the
people
of
dara
notice
that
i
do
say
blueskins
though
they
are
the
people
of
dara
have
made
at
least
one
space
ship
since
weald
threatened
them
with
extermination
there
is
probably
a
new
food
shortage
on
dara
now
leading
to
pure
desperation
most
likely
it
bad
enough
to
make
them
risk
landing
on
orede
to
kill
cattle
and
freeze
beef
to
help
worked
out
she
gasped
and
sprang
to
her
feet
she
snatched
out
the
tiny
blaster
in
her
pocket
she
pointed
it
waveringly
at
him
i
have
to
kill
you
she
cried
desperately
i
i
have
to
calhoun
reached
out
she
tugged
despairingly
at
the
blaster
trigger
nothing
happened
before
she
could
realize
that
she
had
turned
off
the
safety
calhoun
twisted
the
weapon
from
her
fingers
he
stepped
back
good
girl
he
said
approvingly
i
give
this
back
to
you
when
we
land
and
thanks
thanks
very
much
she
wrung
her
hands
then
she
stared
at
him
thanks
when
i
tried
to
kill
you
of
course
said
calhoun
i
made
guesses
i
could
know
that
they
were
right
when
you
tried
to
kill
me
you
confirmed
every
one
now
when
we
land
on
orede
i
going
to
get
you
to
try
to
put
me
in
touch
with
your
friends
it
going
to
be
tricky
because
they
must
be
pretty
well
scared
about
that
ship
but
it
a
highly
desirable
thing
to
get
done
he
went
to
the
ships
control
board
and
sat
down
before
it
twenty
minutes
to
breakhour
he
observed
murgatroyd
peered
out
of
his
little
cubbyhole
his
eyes
were
anxious
are
amiable
little
creatures
during
the
days
in
overdrive
calhoun
had
paid
less
than
the
usual
amount
of
attention
to
murgatroyd
while
the
girl
was
fascinating
they
made
friends
awkwardly
on
the
girl
part
very
pleasantly
on
murgatroyd
but
only
moments
ago
there
had
been
bitter
emotion
in
the
air
murgatroyd
had
fled
to
his
cubbyhole
to
escape
it
he
was
distressed
now
that
there
was
silence
again
he
peered
out
unhappily
he
queried
plaintively
calhoun
said
it
all
right
murgatroyd
if
we
are
blasted
as
we
try
to
land
we
should
be
able
to
make
friends
with
everybody
and
get
something
accomplished
the
statement
was
hopelessly
inaccurate
there
was
no
answer
from
the
ground
when
breakout
came
and
calhoun
drove
the
med
ship
to
a
favourable
position
for
a
call
he
patiently
repeated
over
and
over
again
that
the
med
ship
notified
its
arrival
and
requested
coordinates
for
landing
he
added
that
its
mass
was
fifty
standard
tons
and
that
the
purpose
of
its
visit
was
a
planetary
health
inspection
but
there
was
no
reply
there
should
have
been
a
crisp
description
of
the
direction
from
the
planet
center
at
which
a
certain
time
so
many
hours
or
minutes
later
the
of
the
grid
would
find
it
convenient
to
lock
onto
and
lower
the
med
ship
but
the
communicator
remained
silent
there
is
a
said
calhoun
frowning
and
if
using
it
to
load
fresh
meat
for
dara
from
the
herds
i
told
about
it
should
be
manned
but
they
do
seem
to
intend
to
answer
maybe
they
think
that
if
they
pretend
i
not
here
i
go
away
he
reflected
and
his
frown
deepened
if
i
did
know
what
i
know
i
might
so
if
i
land
on
emergency
rockets
the
blueskins
down
below
may
decide
that
i
come
from
weald
and
in
that
case
it
would
be
reasonable
to
blast
me
before
i
could
land
and
unload
some
fighting
men
on
the
other
hand
no
ship
from
weald
would
conceivably
land
without
impassioned
assurance
that
it
was
safe
it
would
drop
bombs
he
turned
to
the
girl
how
many
darians
down
below
she
shook
her
head
you
do
know
said
calhoun
or
wo
tell
yet
but
they
ought
to
be
told
about
the
arrival
of
that
ship
at
weald
and
what
weald
thinks
about
it
my
guess
is
that
you
came
to
tell
them
it
is
likely
that
dara
gets
news
directly
from
weald
where
were
you
put
ashore
from
dara
when
you
set
out
to
be
a
spy
her
lips
parted
to
speak
but
she
compressed
them
tightly
she
shook
her
head
again
it
must
have
been
plenty
far
away
said
calhoun
restlessly
your
people
would
have
built
a
ship
and
made
fine
forged
papers
for
it
and
they
travel
so
far
from
this
part
of
space
that
when
they
landed
nobody
would
think
of
dara
they
use
to
cover
the
blue
spots
but
maybe
it
was
so
far
away
that
blueskins
had
never
been
heard
of
her
face
looked
pinched
but
she
did
not
reply
then
they
land
half
a
dozen
of
you
with
a
supply
of
for
the
blue
patches
and
you
separate
and
take
ships
that
went
various
roundabout
ways
and
arrive
on
weald
one
by
one
to
see
what
could
be
done
there
to
he
stopped
when
did
you
find
out
positively
that
there
was
any
plague
any
more
she
began
to
grow
pale
i
not
a
mind
reader
said
calhoun
but
it
adds
up
you
from
dara
you
been
on
weald
it
practically
certain
that
there
are
other
agents
if
you
like
that
word
better
on
weald
and
there
has
been
a
plague
on
weald
so
you
people
are
carriers
of
it
but
you
knew
it
in
advance
i
think
how
you
learn
did
a
ship
in
some
sort
of
trouble
land
there
on
dara
y
yes
said
the
girl
we
would
let
it
go
again
but
the
people
did
catch
they
did
die
they
lived
she
stopped
short
it
not
fair
to
trap
me
she
cried
passionately
it
not
fair
i
stop
said
calhoun
he
turned
to
the
control
board
the
med
ship
was
only
planetary
diameters
from
orede
now
and
the
electron
telescope
showed
shining
stars
in
leisurely
motion
across
its
screen
then
a
huge
gibbous
shining
shape
appeared
and
there
were
irregular
patches
of
that
muddy
color
which
is
seabottom
and
varicolored
areas
which
were
plains
and
forests
also
there
were
mountains
calhoun
steadied
the
image
and
squinted
at
it
the
mine
he
observed
was
found
by
members
of
a
hunting
party
killing
wild
cattle
for
sport
even
a
small
planet
has
many
millions
of
square
miles
of
surface
and
a
single
human
installation
on
a
whole
world
will
not
be
easy
to
find
by
random
search
but
there
were
clues
to
this
one
men
hunting
for
sport
would
not
choose
a
tropic
nor
an
arctic
climate
to
hunt
in
so
if
they
found
a
mineral
deposit
it
would
have
been
in
a
temperate
zone
cattle
would
not
be
found
deep
in
a
mountainous
terrain
the
mine
would
not
be
on
a
prairie
the
settlement
on
orede
then
would
be
near
the
edge
of
mountains
not
far
from
a
prairie
such
as
wild
cattle
would
frequent
and
it
would
be
in
a
temperate
climate
forested
areas
could
be
ruled
out
and
there
would
be
a
handling
only
one
ship
at
a
time
it
might
be
a
very
small
grid
it
could
be
only
hundreds
of
yards
across
and
less
than
half
a
mile
high
but
its
shadow
would
be
distinctive
calhoun
searched
among
low
mountains
near
unforested
prairie
in
a
temperate
zone
he
found
a
speck
he
enlarged
it
manyfold
it
was
the
mine
on
orede
there
were
heaps
of
tailings
there
was
something
which
cast
a
long
lacy
shadow
the
but
they
do
answer
our
call
observed
calhoun
so
we
go
down
unwelcomed
he
inverted
the
med
ship
and
the
emergency
rockets
boomed
the
ship
plunged
planetward
a
long
time
later
it
was
deep
in
the
planet
atmosphere
the
noise
of
its
rockets
had
become
thunderous
with
air
to
carry
and
to
reinforce
the
sound
hold
on
to
something
murgatroyd
commanded
calhoun
we
may
have
to
dodge
some
ack
but
nothing
came
up
from
below
the
med
ship
again
inverted
itself
and
its
rockets
pointed
toward
the
planet
and
poured
out
flames
it
checked
slightly
but
continued
to
descend
it
was
not
directly
above
the
grid
it
swept
downward
until
almost
level
with
the
peaks
of
the
mountains
in
which
the
mine
lay
it
tilted
again
and
swept
onward
over
the
mountaintops
and
then
tilted
once
more
and
went
racing
up
the
valley
in
which
the
was
plainly
visible
calhoun
swung
it
on
an
erratic
course
lest
there
be
opposition
but
there
was
no
sign
then
the
rockets
bellowed
and
the
ship
slowed
its
forward
motion
hovered
momentarily
and
settled
to
solidity
outside
the
framework
of
the
grid
the
grid
was
small
as
calhoun
reasoned
but
it
reached
interminably
toward
the
sky
the
rockets
cut
off
slender
as
the
flames
had
been
they
melted
and
bored
thin
deep
into
the
soil
molten
rock
boiled
and
bubbled
down
below
but
there
seemed
no
other
sound
there
was
no
other
motion
there
was
absolute
stillness
all
around
but
when
calhoun
switched
on
the
outside
microphones
a
faint
sweet
melange
of
chirpings
came
from
tiny
creatures
hidden
under
the
vegetation
of
the
mountainsides
calhoun
put
a
blaster
in
his
pocket
and
stood
up
we
see
what
it
looks
like
outside
he
said
with
a
certain
grimness
i
do
quite
believe
what
the
vision
screens
show
minutes
later
he
stepped
down
to
the
ground
from
the
med
ship
exit
port
the
ship
had
landed
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
from
what
once
had
been
a
wooden
building
in
it
ore
from
the
mines
was
concentrated
and
the
useless
tailings
carried
away
by
a
conveyer
belt
to
make
a
monstrous
pile
of
broken
stone
but
there
was
no
longer
a
building
next
to
it
there
had
been
a
structure
containing
an
the
massive
machinery
could
still
be
seen
but
the
structure
was
in
fragments
next
to
that
again
had
been
the
shelters
of
the
mine
they
also
were
shattered
practically
to
matchsticks
the
look
of
the
ground
about
the
building
sites
was
simply
and
purely
impossible
it
was
a
mass
of
hoofprints
cattle
by
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
had
trampled
everything
cattle
had
burst
in
the
wooden
sides
of
the
buildings
cattle
had
piled
themselves
up
against
the
beams
upholding
roofs
until
the
buildings
collapsed
then
cattle
had
gone
plunging
over
the
wrecked
buildings
until
there
was
nothing
left
but
indescribable
chaos
many
many
cattle
had
died
in
the
crush
there
were
heaps
of
dead
beasts
about
the
metal
girders
which
were
the
foundation
of
the
the
air
was
tainted
by
the
smell
of
carrion
the
settlement
had
been
destroyed
positively
by
stampeded
cattle
in
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
charging
blindly
through
and
over
and
upon
it
senselessly
they
trampled
each
other
to
horrible
shapelessness
the
mine
shaft
was
not
choked
because
enormously
strong
timbers
had
fallen
across
and
blocked
it
but
everything
else
was
pure
destruction
calhoun
said
evenly
clever
very
clever
you
ca
blame
men
when
beasts
stampede
we
should
accept
the
evidence
that
some
monstrous
herd
making
its
way
through
a
mountain
pass
somehow
went
crazy
and
bolted
for
the
plains
this
settlement
got
in
the
way
and
it
was
too
bad
for
the
settlement
everything
explained
except
the
ship
that
went
to
weald
a
cattle
stampede
yes
anybody
can
believe
that
but
there
was
a
man
stampede
men
stampeded
into
the
ship
as
blindly
as
the
cattle
trampled
down
this
little
town
the
ship
stampeded
off
into
space
as
insanely
as
the
cattle
but
a
stampede
of
men
and
cattle
in
the
same
place
that
a
little
too
much
but
what
how
asked
calhoun
directly
do
you
intend
to
get
in
touch
with
your
friends
here
i
i
do
know
she
said
distressed
but
if
the
ship
stays
here
they
bound
to
come
and
see
why
wo
they
or
will
they
if
they
sane
they
wo
said
calhoun
the
one
undesirable
thing
here
would
be
human
footprints
on
top
of
cattle
tracks
if
your
friends
are
a
party
from
dara
as
i
believe
they
should
cover
up
their
tracks
get
as
fast
as
possible
and
pray
that
no
signs
of
their
former
presence
are
ever
discovered
that
would
be
their
best
first
move
certainly
what
should
i
do
she
asked
helplessly
i
far
from
sure
at
a
guess
and
for
the
moment
probably
nothing
i
work
something
out
i
got
the
devil
of
a
job
before
me
though
i
ca
spend
but
so
much
time
here
you
can
leave
me
here
he
grunted
and
turned
away
it
was
naturally
unthinkable
that
he
should
leave
another
human
being
on
a
supposedly
uninhabited
planet
with
the
knowledge
that
it
might
actually
be
uninhabited
and
the
future
knowledge
that
any
visitors
would
have
the
strongest
of
possible
reasons
to
hide
themselves
away
he
believed
that
there
were
darians
here
and
the
girl
in
the
med
ship
so
he
also
believed
was
also
a
darian
but
any
who
might
be
hiding
had
so
much
to
lose
if
they
were
discovered
that
they
might
be
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
miles
from
anywhere
a
space
ship
would
normally
land
if
they
had
fled
after
the
incident
of
the
spaceship
departure
with
its
load
of
doomed
passengers
considered
detachedly
the
odds
were
that
there
was
again
a
food
shortage
on
dara
that
blueskins
in
desperation
had
raided
or
were
raiding
or
would
raid
the
cattle
herds
of
orede
for
food
to
carry
back
to
their
home
planet
that
somehow
the
miners
on
orede
had
found
that
they
had
blueskin
neighbors
and
died
of
the
consequences
of
their
terror
it
was
a
risky
guess
to
make
on
such
evidence
as
calhoun
considered
he
had
but
no
other
guess
was
possible
if
his
guess
were
right
he
was
under
some
obligation
to
do
exactly
what
he
believed
the
girl
considered
her
mission
to
warn
all
blueskins
that
weald
would
presently
try
to
find
them
on
orede
when
all
hell
must
break
loose
upon
dara
for
punishment
but
if
there
were
men
here
he
could
leave
a
written
warning
for
them
in
default
of
friendly
contact
they
might
not
find
it
and
a
search
party
of
wealdians
might
all
he
could
possibly
do
was
try
to
make
contact
and
give
warning
by
such
means
as
would
leave
no
evidence
behind
that
he
done
so
weald
would
consider
a
warning
sure
proof
of
blueskin
guilt
it
was
not
satisfactory
to
be
limited
to
broadcasts
which
might
or
might
not
be
picked
up
and
were
unlikely
to
be
acknowledged
but
he
settled
down
with
the
communicator
to
make
the
attempt
he
called
first
on
a
gc
wave
length
and
form
it
was
unlikely
that
blueskins
would
use
general
communication
bands
to
keep
in
touch
with
each
other
but
it
had
to
be
tried
he
broadcast
tuned
as
broadly
as
possible
and
went
up
and
down
the
gc
spectrum
repeating
his
warning
painstakingly
and
listening
without
hope
for
a
reply
he
did
find
one
spot
on
the
dial
where
there
was
of
his
message
as
if
from
a
tuned
receiver
but
he
could
not
get
a
fix
on
it
nobody
might
be
listening
he
exhausted
the
normal
communication
pattern
then
he
broadcast
on
amplitude
modulation
which
a
modern
communicator
would
not
pick
up
at
all
and
which
therefore
might
be
used
by
men
in
hiding
he
worked
for
a
long
time
then
he
shrugged
and
gave
it
up
repeated
to
absolute
tedium
the
facts
that
any
darians
blueskins
on
orede
ought
to
know
there
been
no
answer
and
it
was
all
too
likely
that
if
he
been
received
that
those
who
heard
him
took
his
message
for
a
trick
to
discover
if
there
were
any
hearers
he
clicked
off
at
last
and
stood
up
shaking
his
head
suddenly
the
med
ship
seemed
empty
then
he
saw
murgatroyd
staring
vexedly
at
the
exit
port
the
inner
door
of
that
small
airlock
was
closed
the
telltale
light
said
the
outer
door
was
not
locked
someone
had
gone
out
quietly
the
girl
of
course
calhoun
said
angrily
how
long
ago
murgatroyd
said
murgatroyd
indignantly
it
was
an
answer
but
it
showed
that
murgatroyd
was
vexed
that
been
left
behind
he
and
the
girl
were
close
friends
now
if
left
murgatroyd
in
the
ship
when
he
wanted
to
go
with
her
then
she
was
coming
back
calhoun
swore
he
made
certain
she
was
not
in
the
ship
he
flipped
the
switch
and
said
curtly
into
the
microphone
coffee
murgatroyd
and
i
are
having
coffee
will
you
come
back
please
he
repeated
the
call
and
repeated
it
again
multiplied
as
his
voice
was
by
the
speakers
she
should
hear
him
within
a
mile
she
did
not
appear
he
went
to
a
small
and
inconspicuous
closet
and
armed
himself
a
med
ship
man
was
not
ever
expected
to
fight
but
there
were
available
for
extreme
emergency
when
he
slung
a
over
his
shoulder
and
reached
the
airlock
there
was
still
no
sign
of
his
late
stowaway
he
stood
in
the
airlock
door
for
long
minutes
staring
angrily
about
almost
certainly
she
would
be
looking
in
the
mountains
for
men
of
dara
come
here
for
cattle
he
used
a
pair
of
binoculars
first
at
to
search
as
wide
an
area
as
possible
and
then
at
highest
power
to
search
the
most
likely
routes
he
found
a
small
bobbing
speck
beyond
a
faraway
hill
crest
it
was
her
head
it
went
down
below
the
hilltop
he
snapped
a
command
to
murgatroyd
and
when
the
was
on
the
ground
outside
he
locked
the
port
with
that
combination
that
nobody
but
a
med
ship
man
was
at
all
likely
to
discover
or
use
she
an
idiot
he
told
murgatroyd
sourly
come
along
we
got
to
be
idiots
too
he
set
out
in
pursuit
there
was
blue
sky
overhead
as
was
inevitable
on
any
planet
of
a
yellow
sun
there
were
mountains
as
is
universal
in
planets
whose
surface
rises
and
falls
and
folds
and
bends
from
the
effects
of
weather
or
vulcanism
there
were
plants
as
has
come
about
wherever
microorganisms
have
broken
down
rock
to
a
state
where
it
can
nourish
vegetation
and
naturally
there
were
animals
there
were
even
trees
of
severely
practical
design
and
underbrush
and
equivalent
to
grass
there
was
in
short
a
perfectly
predictable
ecological
system
on
orede
the
organic
molecules
involved
in
life
here
would
be
made
up
of
the
same
elements
in
the
same
combinations
as
elsewhere
where
the
same
conditions
of
temperature
and
moisture
and
sunshine
obtained
it
was
a
distinctly
earthlike
world
as
it
could
not
help
but
be
and
it
was
reasonable
for
cattle
to
thrive
and
increase
here
only
minds
kept
it
from
being
a
place
where
humans
would
thrive
too
but
only
calhoun
would
have
considered
the
splintered
settlement
a
proof
of
that
last
the
girl
had
a
long
start
twice
calhoun
came
to
places
where
she
could
have
chosen
either
of
two
ways
onward
each
time
he
had
to
determine
which
she
followed
that
cost
time
then
the
mountains
abruptly
ended
and
a
vast
undulating
plain
stretched
away
to
the
horizon
there
were
at
least
two
large
masses
and
many
smaller
clumps
of
what
could
only
be
animals
gathered
together
cattle
but
here
the
girl
was
plainly
in
view
calhoun
increased
his
stride
he
began
to
gain
on
her
she
did
not
look
behind
murgatroyd
said
in
a
complaining
tone
i
should
have
left
you
behind
agreed
calhoun
dourly
but
there
was
and
is
a
chance
i
wo
get
back
you
have
to
keep
on
hiking
he
plodded
on
his
memory
of
the
terrain
around
the
mining
settlement
told
him
that
there
was
no
definite
destination
in
the
girl
mind
but
she
was
in
no
such
despair
as
to
want
deliberately
to
be
lost
she
guessed
calhoun
believed
that
if
there
were
darians
on
the
planet
they
keep
the
under
observation
if
they
saw
her
leave
that
area
and
could
see
that
she
was
alone
they
should
intercept
her
to
find
out
the
meaning
of
the
med
landing
then
she
could
identify
herself
as
one
of
them
and
give
them
the
terribly
necessary
warning
of
weald
suspicions
but
said
calhoun
sourly
if
she
right
they
have
seen
me
marching
after
her
now
which
spoils
her
scheme
and
i
like
to
help
it
but
the
way
she
going
is
too
dangerous
he
went
down
into
one
of
the
hollows
of
the
uneven
plain
he
saw
a
clump
of
a
dozen
or
so
cattle
a
little
distance
away
the
bull
looked
up
and
snorted
the
cows
regarded
him
truculently
their
air
was
not
one
of
bovine
tranquility
he
was
up
the
farther
hillside
and
out
of
sight
before
the
bull
worked
himself
up
to
a
charge
then
calhoun
suddenly
remembered
one
of
the
items
in
the
data
about
cattle
he
looked
into
just
the
other
day
he
felt
himself
grow
pale
murgatroyd
he
said
sharply
we
got
to
catch
up
fast
stay
with
me
if
you
can
but
he
was
as
he
spoke
even
if
you
get
lost
i
have
to
hurry
he
ran
fifty
paces
and
walked
fifty
paces
he
ran
fifty
and
walked
fifty
he
saw
her
atop
a
rolling
of
the
ground
she
came
to
a
full
stop
he
ran
he
saw
her
turn
to
retrace
her
steps
he
flung
off
the
safety
of
the
and
let
off
a
roaring
blast
at
the
ground
for
her
to
hear
suddenly
she
was
fleeing
desperately
toward
him
he
plunged
on
she
vanished
down
into
a
hollow
horns
appeared
over
the
hillcrest
just
left
cattle
appeared
four
a
dozen
fifteen
twenty
they
moved
ominously
in
her
wake
he
saw
her
again
running
frantically
over
another
upward
swell
of
the
prairie
he
let
off
another
blast
to
guide
her
he
ran
on
at
top
speed
with
murgatroyd
trailing
anxiously
behind
from
time
to
time
murgatroyd
called
in
frightened
pleading
not
to
be
abandoned
more
cattle
appeared
against
the
horizon
fifty
or
a
hundred
they
came
after
the
first
clump
the
first
group
of
a
bull
and
his
harem
were
moving
faster
now
the
girl
fled
from
them
but
it
is
the
instinct
of
on
the
open
range
calhoun
had
learned
it
only
two
days
before
to
charge
any
human
they
find
on
foot
a
mounted
man
to
their
dim
minds
is
a
creature
to
be
tolerated
or
fled
from
but
a
human
on
foot
is
to
be
crushed
and
stamped
and
gored
those
in
the
lead
were
definitely
charging
now
with
heads
bent
low
the
bull
charged
furiously
with
shut
eyes
as
bulls
do
but
the
cows
many
times
more
deadly
charged
with
their
eyes
wide
open
and
wickedly
alert
and
with
a
lumbering
speed
much
greater
than
the
girl
could
manage
she
came
up
over
the
last
rise
and
gasping
her
hair
flying
in
the
last
extremity
of
terror
the
nearest
of
the
pursuing
cattle
were
within
ten
yards
when
calhoun
fired
from
twenty
yards
beyond
one
creature
bellowed
as
the
struck
it
went
down
and
others
crashed
into
it
and
swept
over
it
and
more
came
on
the
girl
saw
calhoun
now
and
ran
toward
him
panting
he
knelt
very
deliberately
and
began
to
check
the
charge
by
shooting
the
leading
animals
he
did
not
succeed
there
were
more
cattle
following
the
first
and
more
and
more
behind
them
it
appeared
that
all
the
cattle
on
the
plain
joined
in
the
blind
and
senseless
charge
the
thudding
of
hoofs
became
a
mutter
and
then
a
rumble
and
then
a
growl
plunging
clumsy
figures
rushed
past
on
either
side
but
horns
and
heads
heaved
up
over
the
mound
of
animals
calhoun
had
shot
he
shot
them
too
more
and
more
cattle
came
pounding
past
the
rampart
of
his
victims
but
always
it
seemed
some
elected
to
climb
the
heap
of
their
dead
and
dying
fellows
and
calhoun
shot
and
shot
but
he
split
the
herd
the
foremost
animals
had
been
charging
a
sighted
human
enemy
others
had
followed
because
it
is
the
instinct
of
cattle
to
join
their
running
fellows
in
whatever
crazed
urgency
they
feel
there
was
a
dense
pounding
wailing
grunting
puffing
raising
thick
and
impenetrable
clouds
of
dust
which
hid
everything
but
galloping
beasts
going
past
on
either
side
it
lasted
for
minutes
then
the
thunder
of
hoofs
diminished
it
ended
abruptly
and
calhoun
and
the
girl
were
left
alone
with
the
gruesome
pile
of
animals
which
had
divided
the
charging
herd
into
two
parts
they
could
see
the
rears
of
innumerable
running
animals
stupidly
continuing
the
charge
hardly
different
now
from
a
stampede
whose
original
objective
none
now
remembered
calhoun
thoughtfully
touched
the
barrel
of
his
and
winced
at
its
scorching
heat
i
just
realized
he
said
coldly
that
i
do
know
your
name
what
is
it
maril
said
the
girl
she
swallowed
th
thank
you
maril
said
calhoun
you
are
an
idiot
it
was
at
best
to
go
off
by
yourself
you
could
have
been
lost
you
could
have
cost
me
days
of
hunting
for
you
days
badly
needed
for
more
important
matters
he
stopped
and
took
breath
you
may
have
spoiled
what
little
chance
i
got
to
do
something
about
the
plans
weald
already
making
you
have
just
acted
with
the
most
concentrated
folly
and
the
most
magnificent
imbecility
that
you
or
anybody
else
could
manage
he
said
more
bitterly
still
and
i
had
to
leave
murgatroyd
behind
to
get
to
you
in
time
he
was
right
in
the
path
of
that
charge
he
turned
away
from
her
and
said
dourly
all
right
come
on
back
to
the
ship
we
go
to
dara
we
have
to
anyhow
but
murgatroyd
then
he
heard
a
very
small
sneeze
out
of
a
rolling
wall
of
dust
murgatroyd
appeared
forlornly
he
was
and
draggled
and
his
tail
dropped
and
he
sneezed
again
he
moved
as
if
he
could
barely
put
one
paw
before
another
but
at
sight
of
calhoun
he
sneezed
yet
again
and
said
in
a
disconsolate
voice
then
he
sat
down
and
waited
for
calhoun
to
come
and
pick
him
up
when
calhoun
did
so
murgatroyd
clung
to
him
pathetically
and
said
and
again
with
the
intonation
of
one
telling
of
incredible
horrors
and
disasters
endured
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
escape
of
a
small
animal
like
murgatroyd
was
remarkable
he
escaped
the
trampling
hoofs
of
at
least
hundreds
of
charging
animals
luck
must
have
played
a
great
part
in
it
but
an
hysterical
agility
in
dodging
must
have
been
required
too
calhoun
headed
back
for
the
valley
where
the
settlement
had
been
and
the
med
ship
was
murgatroyd
clung
to
his
neck
the
girl
maril
followed
discouragedly
she
was
at
that
age
when
girls
and
men
of
corresponding
type
can
grow
most
passionately
devoted
to
ideals
or
causes
in
default
of
a
promising
personal
romance
when
concerned
with
such
causes
they
become
splendidly
confident
that
whatever
they
decide
to
do
is
sensible
if
only
it
is
dramatic
but
maril
was
shaken
now
calhoun
did
not
speak
to
her
again
he
led
the
way
a
mile
back
toward
the
mountains
they
began
to
see
stragglers
from
the
herd
a
little
farther
those
stragglers
began
to
notice
them
it
would
have
been
a
matter
of
no
moment
if
they
been
domesticated
dairy
cattle
but
these
were
range
cattle
gone
wild
twice
calhoun
had
to
use
his
to
discourage
incipient
charges
by
irritated
bulls
or
even
more
irritated
cows
those
with
calves
darkly
suspected
calhoun
of
designs
upon
their
offspring
it
was
a
relief
to
enter
the
valley
again
but
it
was
two
miles
more
to
the
with
the
med
ship
beside
it
and
the
reek
of
carrion
in
the
air
they
were
perhaps
two
hundred
feet
from
the
ship
when
a
crashed
and
its
bolt
whined
past
calhoun
so
close
that
he
felt
the
monstrous
heat
there
had
been
no
challenge
there
was
no
warning
there
was
simply
a
shot
which
came
horribly
close
to
ending
career
in
a
completely
arbitrary
fashion
five
minutes
later
calhoun
had
located
one
killer
behind
a
mass
of
splintered
planking
that
once
had
been
a
wall
he
set
the
wood
afire
by
a
and
then
viciously
sent
other
bolts
all
around
the
man
it
had
sheltered
when
he
fled
from
the
flames
he
could
have
killed
him
ten
times
over
but
it
was
more
desirable
to
open
communication
so
he
missed
intentionally
maril
had
cried
out
that
she
came
from
dara
and
had
word
for
them
but
they
did
not
answer
there
were
three
men
with
one
was
the
one
calhoun
had
burned
out
of
his
hiding
place
that
man
rifle
exploded
when
the
flames
hit
it
two
remained
one
so
calhoun
presently
discovered
was
working
his
way
behind
underbrush
to
a
shelf
from
which
he
could
shoot
down
at
calhoun
calhoun
had
dropped
into
a
hollow
and
pulled
maril
to
cover
at
the
first
shot
the
second
man
happily
planned
to
get
to
a
point
where
he
could
shoot
him
like
a
fish
in
a
barrel
the
third
man
had
fired
half
a
dozen
times
and
then
disappeared
calhoun
estimated
that
he
intended
to
get
around
to
the
rear
hoping
there
was
no
protection
from
that
direction
for
calhoun
it
would
take
some
time
for
him
to
manage
it
so
calhoun
industriously
concentrated
his
fire
on
the
man
trying
to
get
above
him
he
was
behind
a
boulder
not
too
dissimilar
to
calhoun
breastwork
calhoun
set
fire
to
the
brush
at
the
point
at
which
the
other
man
aimed
that
then
made
his
effort
useless
then
calhoun
sent
a
dozen
bolts
at
the
other
man
rocky
shield
it
heated
up
steam
rose
in
a
whitish
mass
and
blew
directly
away
from
calhoun
he
saw
that
antagonist
flee
he
saw
him
so
clearly
that
he
was
positive
that
there
was
a
patch
of
blue
pigment
on
the
side
of
the
back
of
his
neck
he
grunted
and
swung
to
find
the
third
that
man
moved
through
thick
undergrowth
and
calhoun
set
it
on
fire
in
a
neat
pattern
of
spreading
flames
evidently
these
men
had
had
no
training
in
battle
tactics
with
the
third
man
also
had
to
get
away
he
did
but
something
from
him
arched
through
the
smoke
it
fell
to
the
ground
directly
upwind
from
calhoun
white
smoke
puffed
up
violently
it
was
instinct
that
made
calhoun
react
as
he
did
he
jerked
the
girl
maril
to
her
feet
and
rushed
her
toward
the
med
ship
smoke
from
the
flung
bomb
upwind
barely
swirled
around
him
and
missed
maril
altogether
calhoun
though
got
a
whiff
of
something
strange
not
scorched
or
burning
vegetation
at
all
he
ceased
to
breathe
and
plunged
onward
in
clear
air
he
emptied
his
lungs
and
refilled
them
they
were
then
halfway
to
the
ship
with
murgatroyd
prancing
on
ahead
but
then
calhoun
heart
began
to
pound
furiously
his
muscles
twitched
and
tensed
he
felt
extraordinary
symptoms
like
an
extreme
of
agitation
he
swore
but
a
med
ship
man
would
not
react
to
such
symptoms
as
a
man
would
have
done
calhoun
was
familiar
enough
with
tear
gas
used
by
police
on
some
planets
but
this
was
different
and
worse
even
as
he
helped
and
urged
maril
onward
he
automatically
considered
his
sensations
and
had
it
panic
gas
police
did
not
use
it
because
panic
is
worse
than
rioting
calhoun
felt
all
the
physical
symptoms
of
fear
and
of
gibbering
terror
a
man
whose
mind
yields
to
terror
experiences
certain
physical
sensations
wildly
beating
heart
tensed
and
twitching
muscles
and
a
frantic
impulse
to
convulsive
action
a
man
in
whom
those
physical
sensations
are
induced
by
other
means
will
ordinarily
find
his
mind
yielding
to
terror
calhoun
could
combat
his
feelings
but
his
clinical
attitude
enabled
him
to
act
despite
them
the
three
from
weald
reached
the
base
of
the
med
ship
one
of
their
enemies
had
lost
his
rifle
and
need
not
be
counted
another
had
fled
from
flames
and
might
be
ignored
for
some
moments
anyhow
but
a
struck
the
ship
metal
hull
only
feet
from
calhoun
and
he
whipped
around
to
the
other
side
and
let
loose
a
staccato
of
fire
which
emptied
the
rifle
of
all
its
charges
then
he
opened
the
airlock
door
hating
the
fact
that
he
shook
and
trembled
he
urged
the
girl
and
murgatroyd
in
he
slammed
the
outer
airlock
door
just
as
another
hit
they
they
do
realize
said
maril
desperately
if
they
only
knew
talk
to
them
if
you
like
said
calhoun
his
teeth
chattered
and
he
raged
because
the
symptom
was
of
terror
he
denied
he
pushed
a
button
on
the
control
board
he
pointed
to
a
microphone
he
got
at
an
oxygen
bottle
and
inhaled
deeply
oxygen
obviously
should
be
an
antidote
for
panic
since
the
symptoms
of
terror
act
to
increase
the
oxygenation
of
the
bloodstream
and
muscles
and
to
make
superhuman
exertion
possible
if
necessary
breathing
percent
oxygen
produced
the
effect
the
gas
strove
for
so
his
heart
slowed
nearly
to
normal
and
his
body
relaxed
he
held
out
his
hand
and
it
did
not
tremble
he
been
affronted
to
see
it
shake
uncontrollably
when
he
pushed
the
microphone
button
for
maril
he
turned
to
her
she
had
spoken
into
the
mike
they
may
not
be
from
dara
she
said
shakily
i
just
thought
they
could
be
somebody
else
maybe
criminals
who
planned
to
raid
the
mine
for
a
shipload
of
its
nonsense
said
calhoun
i
saw
one
of
them
clearly
enough
to
be
sure
but
they
skeptical
characters
i
afraid
there
may
be
more
on
the
way
here
from
wherever
they
keep
themselves
anyhow
now
we
know
some
of
them
are
in
hearing
i
take
advantage
of
that
and
we
go
on
he
took
the
microphone
an
instant
later
his
voice
boomed
in
the
stillness
outside
the
ship
cutting
through
the
thin
shrill
whirring
of
invisible
small
creatures
this
is
the
med
ship
said
calhoun
voice
amplified
to
a
shout
i
left
weald
four
days
ago
one
day
after
the
cargo
ship
from
here
arrived
with
everybody
on
board
dead
on
weald
they
do
know
how
it
happened
but
they
suspect
blueskins
sooner
or
later
they
search
here
get
away
cover
up
your
tracks
hide
all
signs
that
you
ever
been
here
get
the
hell
away
fast
one
more
warning
there
talk
of
dara
they
scared
if
they
find
your
traces
be
still
more
scared
so
cover
up
your
tracks
and
get
away
from
here
the
voice
rolled
and
echoed
among
the
hills
but
it
was
very
clear
where
it
could
be
heard
it
could
be
understood
and
it
could
be
heard
for
miles
but
there
was
no
response
to
it
calhoun
waited
a
reasonable
time
then
he
shrugged
and
seated
himself
at
the
control
board
it
is
easy
he
observed
to
persuade
desperate
men
that
outsmarted
themselves
hold
hard
murgatroyd
the
rockets
bellowed
then
there
was
a
tremendous
noise
to
end
all
noises
and
the
ship
began
to
climb
it
sped
up
and
up
and
up
by
the
time
it
was
out
of
atmosphere
it
had
velocity
enough
to
coast
to
clear
space
and
calhoun
cut
the
rockets
altogether
he
busied
himself
with
those
astrogational
chores
which
began
with
orienting
oneself
to
galactic
directions
after
leaving
a
planet
which
rotates
at
its
own
individual
speed
then
one
computes
the
overdrive
course
to
another
planet
from
the
respecting
coordinates
of
the
world
one
is
leaving
and
the
one
one
aims
for
then
in
this
case
at
any
rate
there
was
the
very
finicky
task
of
picking
out
a
star
of
whose
planets
one
was
his
destination
he
aimed
for
it
with
precision
overdrive
coming
he
said
presently
hold
on
space
reeled
there
was
nausea
and
giddiness
and
a
horrible
sensation
of
falling
in
a
wildly
unlikely
spiral
then
stillness
and
solidity
and
the
blackness
outside
the
med
ship
the
little
craft
was
in
overdrive
again
after
a
long
while
the
girl
maril
said
uneasily
i
do
know
what
you
plan
now
i
going
to
dara
said
calhoun
on
orede
i
tried
to
get
the
blueskins
there
to
get
going
fast
maybe
i
succeeded
i
do
know
but
this
thing
been
mishandled
even
if
there
a
famine
people
should
do
things
out
of
desperation
being
desperate
jogs
the
brain
one
does
think
straight
i
know
now
that
i
was
very
foolish
forget
it
commanded
calhoun
i
was
talking
about
you
here
i
run
into
a
situation
that
the
med
service
should
have
caught
and
cleaned
up
generations
ago
but
it
not
only
a
med
service
obligation
it
a
current
mess
before
i
could
begin
to
get
at
the
basic
problem
those
idiots
on
orede
it
happened
before
i
reached
weald
an
emotional
explosion
triggered
by
a
ship
full
of
dead
men
that
nobody
intended
to
kill
maril
shook
her
head
those
darian
characters
said
calhoun
annoyed
should
have
gone
to
orede
in
the
first
place
if
they
went
there
they
should
at
least
have
stayed
on
a
continent
where
there
were
no
people
from
weald
digging
a
mine
and
hunting
cattle
for
sport
on
their
off
days
they
could
be
spotted
i
believe
they
were
and
again
if
it
had
been
a
long
way
from
the
mine
installation
they
could
probably
have
wiped
out
the
people
who
sighted
them
before
they
could
get
back
with
the
news
but
it
looks
like
miners
saw
men
hunting
and
got
close
enough
to
see
they
were
blueskins
and
then
got
back
to
the
mine
with
the
news
she
waited
for
him
to
explain
i
know
i
guessing
but
it
fits
he
said
distastefully
so
something
had
to
be
done
either
the
mining
settlement
had
to
be
wiped
out
or
the
story
that
blueskins
were
on
orede
had
to
be
discredited
the
blueskins
tried
for
both
they
used
panic
gas
on
a
herd
of
cattle
and
it
made
them
crazy
and
they
charged
the
settlement
like
the
lunatics
they
are
and
the
blueskins
used
panic
gas
on
the
settlement
itself
as
the
cattle
went
through
it
should
have
settled
the
whole
business
nicely
after
it
was
over
every
man
in
the
settlement
would
believe
he
been
out
of
his
head
for
a
while
and
he
have
the
crazy
state
of
the
settlement
to
think
about
he
would
be
sure
of
what
he
seen
or
heard
they
might
try
to
verify
the
blueskin
story
later
but
they
believe
anything
with
certainty
it
should
have
worked
again
she
waited
unfortunately
when
the
miners
panicked
they
stampeded
into
the
ship
also
unfortunately
panic
gas
got
into
the
ship
with
them
so
they
stayed
panicked
while
the
astrogator
in
panic
took
off
they
headed
for
weald
and
threw
on
the
overdrive
which
would
be
set
for
weald
anyhow
because
that
would
be
the
fastest
way
to
run
away
from
whatever
he
imagined
he
feared
but
he
and
all
the
men
on
the
ship
were
still
crazy
with
panic
from
the
gas
they
kept
breathing
until
they
died
silence
after
a
long
interval
maril
asked
you
do
think
the
darians
intended
to
kill
i
think
they
were
stupid
said
calhoun
angrily
somebody
always
urging
the
police
to
use
panic
gas
in
case
of
public
tumult
but
too
dangerous
nobody
knows
what
one
man
will
do
in
a
panic
take
a
hundred
or
two
or
three
and
panic
them
all
and
there
no
limit
to
their
craziness
the
whole
thing
was
handled
wrong
but
you
do
blame
them
for
being
stupid
yes
said
calhoun
fretfully
but
if
i
been
in
their
place
perhaps
where
were
you
born
asked
maril
suddenly
calhoun
jerked
his
head
around
no
not
where
you
guessing
or
hoping
not
on
dara
just
because
i
act
as
if
darians
were
human
does
mean
i
have
to
be
one
i
a
med
service
man
and
i
acting
as
i
think
i
should
his
tone
became
exasperated
dammit
i
supposed
to
deal
with
health
situations
actual
and
possible
causes
of
human
deaths
and
if
weald
thinks
it
finds
proof
that
blueskins
are
in
space
again
and
caused
the
death
of
wealdians
it
wo
be
healthy
they
halfway
set
anyhow
to
drop
on
dara
to
wipe
it
out
maril
said
fiercely
they
might
as
well
drop
bombs
it
be
quicker
than
starvation
at
least
calhoun
looked
at
her
more
exasperated
than
before
it
is
a
crop
failure
again
he
demanded
when
she
nodded
he
said
bitterly
famine
conditions
already
when
she
nodded
again
he
said
drearily
and
of
course
famine
is
the
of
health
problems
and
that
right
in
my
lap
with
all
the
rest
he
stood
up
then
he
sat
down
again
i
tired
he
said
flatly
i
like
to
get
some
sleep
would
you
mind
taking
a
book
or
something
and
going
into
the
other
cabin
murgatroyd
and
i
would
like
a
little
relaxation
from
reality
with
luck
if
i
go
to
sleep
i
may
only
have
a
nightmare
it
be
a
terrific
improvement
on
what
i
in
now
alone
in
the
control
compartment
he
tried
to
relax
but
it
was
not
possible
he
flung
himself
into
a
comfortable
chair
and
brooded
there
is
brooding
and
brooding
it
can
be
a
form
of
wallowing
in
engaged
in
for
emotional
satisfaction
but
it
can
be
also
a
way
of
bringing
out
unfavorable
factors
in
a
situation
a
man
in
optimistic
mood
can
ignore
them
but
no
awkward
situation
is
likely
to
be
remedied
while
any
of
its
elements
are
neglected
calhoun
dourly
considered
the
situation
of
the
people
of
the
planet
dara
which
it
was
his
job
as
a
med
service
man
to
remedy
or
at
least
improve
those
people
were
marked
by
patches
of
blue
pigment
as
an
inherited
consequence
of
a
plague
of
three
generations
past
because
of
the
marking
which
it
was
easy
to
believe
a
sign
of
continuing
infection
they
were
hated
and
dreaded
by
their
neighbors
dara
was
a
planet
of
pariahs
excluded
from
the
human
race
by
those
who
feared
them
and
now
there
was
famine
on
dara
for
the
second
time
and
they
were
of
no
mind
to
starve
quietly
there
was
food
on
the
planet
orede
monstrous
herds
of
cattle
without
owners
it
was
natural
enough
for
darians
to
build
a
ship
or
ships
and
try
to
bring
food
back
to
its
starving
people
but
that
desperately
necessary
enterprise
had
now
roused
weald
to
a
frenzy
of
apprehension
weald
was
if
possible
more
hysterically
afraid
of
blueskins
than
ever
before
and
even
more
implacably
the
enemy
of
the
starving
planet
population
weald
itself
prospered
ironically
it
had
such
an
excess
of
foodstuffs
that
it
stored
them
in
unneeded
spaceships
in
orbits
about
itself
hundreds
of
thousands
of
tons
of
grain
circled
weald
in
hulks
while
the
people
of
dara
starved
and
only
dared
try
to
steal
if
it
could
be
called
stealing
some
of
the
innumerable
wild
cattle
of
orede
the
blueskins
on
orede
could
not
trust
calhoun
so
they
pretended
not
to
hear
or
maybe
that
did
hear
they
been
abandoned
and
betrayed
by
all
of
humanity
off
their
world
they
been
threatened
and
oppressed
by
guardships
in
orbit
about
them
ready
to
shoot
down
any
spacecraft
they
might
send
aloft
so
calhoun
brooded
while
murgatroyd
presently
yawned
and
climbed
to
his
cubbyhole
and
curled
up
to
sleep
with
his
furry
tail
carefully
adjusted
over
his
nose
a
long
time
later
calhoun
heard
small
sounds
which
were
not
normal
on
a
med
ship
in
overdrive
they
were
not
part
of
the
random
noises
carefully
generated
to
keep
the
silence
of
the
ship
endurable
calhoun
raised
his
head
he
listened
sharply
no
sound
could
come
from
outside
he
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
sleeping
cabin
the
noises
stopped
instantly
come
out
he
commanded
through
the
door
i
i
all
right
said
maril
voice
but
it
was
not
quite
steady
she
paused
did
i
make
a
noise
i
was
having
a
bad
dream
i
wish
said
calhoun
that
you
tell
me
the
truth
just
occasionally
come
out
please
there
were
stirrings
after
a
little
it
opened
and
maril
appeared
she
looked
as
if
she
been
crying
she
said
quickly
i
probably
look
queer
but
it
because
i
was
asleep
to
the
contrary
said
calhoun
fuming
you
been
lying
awake
crying
i
do
know
why
i
been
out
here
wishing
i
could
because
i
frustrated
but
since
you
are
asleep
maybe
you
can
help
me
with
my
job
i
figured
some
things
out
for
some
others
i
need
facts
will
you
give
them
to
me
she
swallowed
i
try
coffee
he
asked
murgatroyd
popped
his
head
out
of
his
miniature
sleeping
cabin
he
asked
interestedly
go
back
to
sleep
snapped
calhoun
he
began
to
pace
back
and
forth
i
need
to
know
something
about
the
pigment
patches
he
said
jerkily
maybe
it
sounds
crazy
to
think
of
such
things
now
first
things
first
you
know
but
this
is
a
first
thing
so
long
as
darians
look
like
the
people
of
other
worlds
they
be
believed
to
be
different
if
they
look
repulsive
they
be
believed
to
be
evil
tell
me
about
those
patches
they
different
sizes
and
different
shapes
and
they
appear
in
different
places
you
none
on
your
face
or
hands
anyhow
i
have
any
at
all
said
the
girl
reservedly
i
thought
not
everybody
she
said
defensively
nearly
yes
but
not
all
some
people
do
have
them
some
people
are
born
with
bluish
splotches
on
their
skin
but
they
fade
out
while
they
children
when
they
grow
up
they
just
like
the
people
of
weald
or
any
other
world
and
their
children
never
have
them
calhoun
stared
you
could
possibly
be
proved
to
be
a
darian
then
she
shook
her
head
calhoun
remembered
and
started
the
coffee
when
you
left
dara
he
said
you
were
carried
a
long
long
way
to
some
planet
where
they
practically
never
heard
of
dara
and
where
the
name
meant
nothing
you
could
have
settled
there
or
anywhere
else
and
forgotten
about
dara
but
you
did
why
not
since
you
not
a
blueskin
but
i
am
she
said
fiercely
my
parents
my
brothers
and
sisters
and
korvan
then
she
bit
her
lip
calhoun
took
note
but
did
not
comment
on
the
name
she
mentioned
then
your
parents
had
the
splotches
fade
so
you
never
had
them
he
said
absorbedly
something
like
that
happened
on
tralee
once
there
a
virus
a
whole
group
of
virus
particles
normally
we
humans
are
immune
to
them
one
has
to
be
in
terrifically
bad
physical
condition
for
them
to
take
hold
and
produce
whatever
effects
they
do
but
once
they
established
they
passed
on
from
mother
to
child
and
when
they
die
out
it
during
childhood
too
he
poured
coffee
for
the
two
of
them
murgatroyd
swung
down
to
the
floor
and
said
impatiently
chee
chee
calhoun
absently
filled
murgatroyd
tiny
cup
and
handed
it
to
him
but
this
is
marvellous
he
said
exuberantly
the
blue
patches
appeared
after
the
plague
did
they
after
people
recovered
when
they
recovered
maril
stared
at
him
his
mind
was
filled
with
strictly
professional
considerations
he
was
not
talking
to
her
as
a
person
she
was
purely
a
source
of
information
so
i
told
said
maril
reservedly
are
there
any
more
humiliating
questions
you
want
to
ask
he
gaped
at
her
then
he
said
ruefully
i
stupid
maril
but
touchy
there
nothing
personal
there
is
to
me
she
said
fiercely
i
was
born
among
blueskins
and
they
of
my
blood
and
they
hated
and
i
have
been
killed
on
weald
if
i
been
known
as
what
i
am
and
there
korvan
who
arranged
for
me
to
be
sent
away
as
a
spy
and
advised
me
to
do
just
what
you
said
abandon
my
home
world
and
everybody
i
care
about
including
him
it
personal
to
me
calhoun
wrinkled
his
forehead
helplessly
i
sorry
he
repeated
drink
your
coffee
i
do
want
it
she
said
bitterly
i
like
to
die
if
you
stay
around
where
i
am
calhoun
told
her
you
may
get
your
wish
all
right
there
be
no
more
questions
she
turned
and
moved
toward
the
door
to
the
cabin
calhoun
looked
after
her
maril
what
why
were
you
crying
you
would
understand
she
said
evenly
calhoun
shrugged
his
shoulders
almost
up
to
his
ears
he
was
a
professional
man
in
his
profession
he
was
not
incompetent
but
there
is
no
profession
in
which
a
really
competent
man
tries
to
understand
women
calhoun
annoyed
had
to
let
fate
or
chance
or
disaster
take
care
of
maril
personal
problems
he
had
larger
matters
to
cope
with
but
he
had
something
to
work
on
now
he
hunted
busily
in
the
reference
tapes
he
came
up
with
an
explicit
collection
of
information
on
exactly
the
subject
he
needed
he
left
the
control
room
to
go
down
into
the
storage
areas
of
the
med
ship
hull
he
found
an
ultra
frigid
storage
box
whose
contents
were
kept
at
the
temperature
of
liquid
air
he
donned
thick
gloves
used
a
special
set
of
tongs
and
extracted
a
tiny
block
of
plastic
in
which
a
phial
of
glass
was
embedded
it
frosted
instantly
he
took
it
out
and
when
the
storage
box
was
closed
again
the
block
was
covered
with
a
thick
and
opaque
coating
of
frozen
moisture
he
went
back
to
the
control
room
and
pulled
down
the
panel
which
made
available
a
but
surprisingly
adequate
biological
laboratory
he
set
the
plastic
block
in
a
container
which
would
raise
it
very
very
gradually
to
a
specific
temperature
and
hold
it
there
it
was
obviously
a
living
culture
from
which
any
imaginable
quantity
of
the
same
culture
could
be
bred
calhoun
set
the
apparatus
with
great
exactitude
this
he
told
murgatroyd
may
be
a
good
day
work
now
i
think
i
can
rest
then
for
a
long
while
there
was
no
sound
or
movement
in
the
med
ship
the
girl
may
have
slept
or
maybe
not
calhoun
lay
relaxed
in
a
chair
which
at
the
touch
of
a
button
became
the
most
comfortable
of
sleeping
places
murgatroyd
remained
in
his
cubbyhole
his
tail
curled
over
his
nose
there
were
comforting
unheard
easily
dismissable
murmurings
now
and
again
they
kept
the
feeling
of
life
alive
in
the
ship
but
for
such
infinitesimal
stirrings
of
sound
carefully
recorded
for
this
exact
purpose
the
feel
of
the
ship
would
have
been
that
of
a
tomb
but
it
was
quite
otherwise
when
another
began
with
the
taped
sounds
of
morning
activities
as
faint
as
echoes
but
nevertheless
establishing
an
atmosphere
of
their
own
calhoun
examined
the
plastic
block
and
its
contents
he
read
the
instruments
which
had
cared
for
it
while
he
slept
he
put
the
block
no
longer
frosted
in
the
culture
microscope
and
saw
its
enclosed
infinitesimal
particles
of
life
in
the
process
of
multiplying
on
the
food
that
had
been
frozen
with
them
when
they
were
reduced
to
the
spore
condition
he
beamed
he
replaced
the
block
in
the
incubation
oven
and
faced
the
day
cheerfully
maril
greeted
him
with
great
reserve
they
breakfasted
with
murgatroyd
eating
from
his
own
platter
on
the
floor
a
tiny
cup
of
coffee
alongside
i
been
thinking
said
maril
evenly
i
think
i
can
get
you
a
hearing
for
whatever
ideas
you
may
have
to
help
dara
kind
of
you
murmured
calhoun
in
theory
a
med
service
man
had
all
the
authority
needed
for
this
or
any
other
emergency
the
power
to
declare
a
planet
in
quarantine
so
cutting
it
off
from
all
interstellar
commerce
should
be
enough
to
force
cooperation
from
any
world
government
but
in
practice
calhoun
had
exactly
as
much
power
as
he
could
exercise
and
weald
could
not
think
straight
where
blueskins
were
concerned
and
certainly
the
authorities
on
dara
could
not
be
expected
to
be
levelheaded
they
had
a
history
of
isolation
and
outlawry
and
long
experience
of
being
regarded
as
less
than
human
in
cold
fact
calhoun
had
no
power
at
all
may
i
ask
whose
influence
you
exert
asked
calhoun
there
a
man
said
maril
reservedly
who
thinks
a
great
deal
of
me
i
do
know
his
present
official
position
but
he
was
certain
to
become
prominent
i
tell
him
how
you
acted
up
to
now
and
your
attitude
and
of
course
that
you
med
service
he
be
glad
to
help
you
i
sure
splendid
said
calhoun
nodding
that
will
be
korvan
she
started
how
did
you
know
intuition
said
calhoun
dryly
all
right
i
count
on
him
but
he
did
not
he
worked
in
the
tiny
biological
lab
all
that
and
all
the
next
the
girl
was
very
quiet
murgatroyd
tried
to
enter
into
pretended
conversation
with
her
but
she
was
not
able
to
match
his
pretense
on
the
after
the
time
for
breakout
approached
while
the
ship
was
practically
a
world
all
by
itself
it
was
easy
to
look
forward
with
confidence
to
the
future
but
when
contact
and
in
a
fashion
conflict
with
other
and
larger
worlds
loomed
nearer
prospects
seemed
less
bright
calhoun
had
definite
plans
now
but
there
were
so
many
ways
in
which
they
could
be
frustrated
calhoun
sat
down
at
the
control
board
and
watched
the
clock
i
got
things
lined
up
he
told
maril
if
only
they
work
out
if
i
can
make
somebody
on
dara
listen
which
is
unlikely
and
follow
my
advice
which
they
probably
wo
and
if
weald
does
get
the
ideas
it
probably
will
get
and
is
doing
what
i
suspect
it
is
why
maybe
something
can
be
done
i
sure
you
do
your
best
said
maril
politely
calhoun
managed
to
grin
he
watched
the
clock
there
was
no
sensation
attached
to
overdrive
travel
except
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
it
was
now
time
for
the
end
he
might
find
most
anything
having
happened
his
plans
might
immediately
be
seen
to
be
hopeless
weald
could
have
sent
ships
to
dara
or
dara
might
be
in
such
a
state
of
desperation
as
it
turned
out
dara
was
desperate
the
med
ship
came
out
nearly
a
from
the
sun
about
which
the
planet
dara
revolved
calhoun
went
into
a
short
hop
toward
it
then
dara
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
blazing
yellow
star
it
took
time
to
reach
it
he
called
down
identifying
himself
and
the
ship
and
asking
for
coordinates
so
his
ship
could
be
brought
to
ground
there
was
confusion
as
if
the
request
were
so
unusual
that
the
answers
were
not
ready
the
grid
too
was
on
the
planet
night
side
presently
the
ship
was
locked
onto
by
the
grid
it
went
downward
calhoun
saw
that
maril
sat
tensely
twisting
her
fingers
within
each
other
until
the
ship
actually
touched
ground
then
he
opened
the
exit
port
and
faced
armed
men
in
the
darkness
with
trained
on
him
there
was
a
portable
cannon
trained
on
the
med
ship
itself
come
out
rasped
a
voice
if
you
try
anything
you
get
blasted
your
ship
and
its
contents
are
seized
by
the
planetary
government
it
seemed
that
the
smell
of
hunger
was
in
the
air
the
armed
men
were
emaciated
lights
came
on
and
stark
harsh
shadows
lay
black
upon
the
ground
calhoun
captors
were
uniformed
but
the
uniforms
hung
loosely
upon
them
where
the
lights
struck
upon
their
faces
their
cheeks
were
hollow
they
were
cadaverous
and
there
were
the
splotches
of
pigment
of
which
calhoun
had
heard
the
man
nearest
the
med
ship
port
had
a
monstrous
irregular
marking
over
half
of
one
side
of
his
face
and
up
upon
his
forehead
the
man
next
to
him
had
a
blue
throat
the
next
man
again
was
less
marked
but
his
left
ear
was
blue
and
there
was
what
seemed
a
splashing
of
the
same
color
on
the
skin
under
his
hair
the
leader
of
the
truculent
group
it
might
have
been
a
firing
squad
made
an
imperious
gesture
with
his
hand
it
was
blue
except
for
two
fingers
which
in
the
glaring
illumination
seemed
whiter
than
white
out
said
that
man
savagely
we
taking
over
your
stock
of
food
you
get
your
share
of
it
like
everybody
else
but
maril
spoke
over
calhoun
shoulder
she
uttered
a
cryptic
sentence
or
two
it
should
have
amounted
to
identification
but
there
was
skepticism
in
the
armed
party
oh
you
one
of
us
eh
said
the
guard
leader
sardonically
you
have
a
chance
to
prove
that
come
out
of
there
calhoun
spoke
abruptly
this
is
a
med
ship
he
said
there
are
medicines
and
bacterial
culture
inside
it
they
should
be
meddled
with
here
on
dara
you
had
enough
of
plagues
the
man
with
the
blue
hand
said
as
sardonically
as
before
i
said
the
government
was
taking
over
your
ship
it
wo
be
looted
but
not
taking
a
full
cargo
of
food
away
in
fact
it
not
likely
leaving
and
i
want
to
speak
to
someone
in
authority
snapped
calhoun
just
come
from
weald
he
felt
bristling
hatred
all
about
him
as
he
named
weald
there
tumult
there
they
talking
about
dropping
here
it
important
that
i
talk
to
somebody
with
the
authority
to
take
a
few
sensible
precautions
he
descended
to
the
ground
there
was
a
panicky
chee
from
behind
him
and
murgatroyd
came
dashing
to
swarm
up
his
body
and
cling
apprehensively
to
his
neck
what
that
a
said
calhoun
he
not
a
pet
your
medical
men
will
know
something
about
him
this
is
a
med
ship
and
i
a
med
ship
man
and
he
an
important
member
of
the
crew
he
a
med
ship
and
he
stays
with
me
the
man
with
the
blue
hand
said
harshly
there
somebody
waiting
to
ask
you
questions
here
a
groundcar
came
rolling
out
from
the
side
of
the
enclosure
the
groundcar
ran
on
wheels
and
wheels
were
not
much
used
on
modern
worlds
dara
was
behind
the
times
in
more
ways
than
one
this
car
will
take
you
to
defense
and
you
can
tell
them
anything
you
want
but
do
try
to
sneak
back
in
this
ship
it
be
guarded
the
groundcar
was
enclosed
with
room
for
a
driver
and
the
three
from
the
med
ship
but
armed
men
festooned
themselves
about
its
exterior
and
it
went
bumping
and
rolling
to
the
massive
girders
of
the
grid
it
rolled
out
under
them
and
onto
a
paved
highway
it
picked
up
speed
there
were
buildings
on
either
side
of
the
road
but
few
showed
lights
this
was
night
and
the
men
at
the
had
set
a
pattern
of
hunger
so
that
the
silence
and
the
dark
buildings
did
not
seem
a
sign
of
tranquility
and
sleep
but
of
exhaustion
and
despair
the
highway
lamps
were
few
by
comparison
with
other
inhabited
worlds
and
the
groundcar
needed
lights
of
its
own
to
guide
its
driver
over
a
paved
surface
that
needed
repair
by
those
moving
lights
other
depressing
things
could
be
seen
untidiness
buildings
not
kept
up
to
perfection
evidences
of
apathy
the
road
which
had
been
cleaned
lately
litter
here
and
there
even
the
fact
that
there
were
no
stars
added
to
the
feeling
of
wretchedness
and
gloom
and
ultimately
of
hunger
maril
spoke
nervously
to
the
driver
the
famine
is
any
better
he
moved
his
head
in
negation
but
did
not
speak
there
was
a
splotch
of
blue
pigment
at
the
back
of
his
neck
it
extended
upward
into
his
hair
i
left
two
years
ago
said
maril
it
was
just
beginning
then
rationing
had
started
the
driver
said
evenly
there
rationing
now
the
car
went
on
and
on
a
vast
open
space
appeared
ahead
lights
about
its
perimeter
seemed
few
and
pale
everything
seems
worse
even
the
lights
using
all
the
power
said
the
driver
to
warm
up
ground
to
grow
crops
where
it
ought
to
be
winter
not
doing
too
well
either
calhoun
knew
somehow
that
maril
moistened
her
lips
i
was
sent
she
explained
to
the
driver
to
go
ashore
on
trent
and
then
make
my
way
to
weald
i
mailed
reports
of
what
i
found
out
back
to
trent
somebody
got
them
back
to
here
whenever
it
was
possible
the
driver
said
everybody
knows
the
man
on
trent
disappeared
maybe
he
got
caught
maybe
somebody
saw
him
without
or
maybe
he
just
quit
being
one
of
us
what
the
difference
no
use
calhoun
found
himself
wincing
a
little
the
driver
was
not
angry
he
was
hopeless
but
men
should
not
despair
they
should
accept
hostility
from
those
about
them
as
a
device
of
fate
for
their
destruction
maril
said
quickly
to
calhoun
you
understand
dara
a
planet
there
are
many
light
elements
in
our
soil
potassium
is
scarce
so
our
ground
is
very
fertile
before
the
plague
we
traded
metals
and
manufactured
products
for
imports
of
food
and
potash
but
since
the
plague
we
had
no
commerce
we
been
quarantined
i
gathered
as
much
said
calhoun
it
was
up
to
med
service
to
see
that
that
did
happen
it
up
to
med
service
now
to
see
that
it
stops
too
late
now
for
anything
said
the
driver
whatever
med
service
may
be
they
talking
about
cutting
down
our
population
so
be
food
enough
for
some
to
live
there
are
two
questions
about
it
one
is
who
to
be
kept
alive
and
the
other
is
why
the
groundcar
aimed
now
for
a
cluster
of
faintly
brighter
lights
on
the
far
side
of
the
great
open
space
they
enlarged
as
they
grew
nearer
maril
said
hesitantly
there
was
someone
korvan
calhoun
did
catch
the
rest
of
the
name
maril
said
hesitantly
he
was
working
on
food
plants
i
thought
he
might
accomplish
something
the
driver
said
caustically
sure
everybody
heard
about
him
he
came
up
with
a
wonderful
thing
he
and
his
outfit
worked
out
a
way
to
process
weeds
so
they
can
be
eaten
and
they
can
you
can
fill
your
belly
and
not
feel
hungry
but
it
like
eating
hay
you
starve
just
the
same
he
still
working
head
of
a
government
division
the
groundcar
passed
through
a
gate
it
stopped
before
a
lighted
door
the
armed
men
hanging
to
its
outside
dropped
off
they
watched
calhoun
closely
as
he
stepped
out
with
murgatroyd
riding
on
his
shoulder
minutes
later
they
faced
a
hastily
summoned
group
of
officials
of
the
darian
government
for
a
ship
to
land
on
dara
was
so
remarkable
an
event
that
it
called
practically
for
a
cabinet
meeting
and
calhoun
noted
that
they
were
no
better
fed
than
the
guards
at
the
spaceport
they
regarded
calhoun
and
maril
with
oddly
burning
eyes
it
was
of
course
because
the
two
of
them
showed
no
signs
of
hunger
they
obviously
had
not
been
on
short
rations
darians
had
this
now
to
increase
a
hatred
which
was
inevitable
anyhow
directed
at
all
peoples
off
their
own
planet
my
name
is
calhoun
said
calhoun
briskly
i
the
usual
med
service
credentials
now
he
did
not
wait
to
be
questioned
he
told
them
of
the
appalling
state
of
things
in
the
twelfth
sector
of
the
med
service
so
that
men
had
been
borrowed
from
other
sectors
to
remedy
the
intolerable
and
he
was
one
of
them
he
told
of
his
arrival
at
weald
and
what
had
happened
there
from
the
excessively
cautious
insistence
that
he
prove
he
was
not
a
darian
to
the
arrival
of
the
from
orede
he
was
giving
them
the
news
affecting
them
as
they
had
not
heard
it
before
he
went
on
to
tell
of
his
stop
at
orede
and
his
purpose
and
his
encounter
with
the
men
he
found
there
when
he
finished
there
was
silence
he
broke
it
now
he
said
maril
an
agent
of
yours
she
can
add
to
what
told
you
i
med
service
i
have
a
job
to
do
here
to
carry
out
what
was
done
before
i
should
make
a
planetary
health
inspection
and
make
recommendations
for
the
improvement
of
the
state
of
things
be
glad
if
you
arrange
for
me
to
talk
to
your
health
officials
things
look
bad
and
something
should
be
done
someone
laughed
without
mirth
what
will
you
recommend
for
undernourishment
he
asked
derisively
that
our
health
problem
i
recommend
food
said
calhoun
where
you
fill
the
prescription
i
the
answer
to
that
too
said
calhoun
curtly
i
want
to
talk
to
any
space
pilots
you
got
get
your
astrogators
together
and
i
think
they
approve
my
idea
the
silence
was
totally
skeptical
orede
not
orede
said
calhoun
weald
will
be
hunting
that
planet
over
for
darians
if
they
find
any
they
drop
bombs
here
our
only
space
pilots
said
a
tall
man
presently
are
on
orede
now
if
you
told
the
truth
they
probably
head
back
because
of
your
warning
they
should
bring
meat
his
mouth
worked
peculiarly
and
calhoun
knew
that
it
was
at
the
thought
of
food
which
said
another
man
sharply
goes
to
the
hospitals
i
tasted
meat
in
two
years
nobody
has
growled
another
man
still
but
here
this
man
calhoun
i
not
convinced
he
can
work
magic
but
we
can
find
out
if
he
lies
put
a
guard
on
his
ship
otherwise
let
our
health
men
give
him
his
head
they
find
out
if
he
from
this
medical
service
he
tells
of
and
this
maril
i
can
be
identified
said
maril
i
was
sent
to
gather
information
and
send
it
in
secret
writing
to
one
of
us
on
trent
i
have
a
family
here
they
know
me
and
i
there
was
someone
who
was
working
on
foods
and
i
believe
he
made
it
possible
to
use
all
sorts
of
vegetation
for
food
he
will
identify
me
someone
laughed
harshly
maril
swallowed
i
like
to
see
him
she
repeated
and
my
family
some
of
the
men
turned
away
a
man
said
bluntly
do
look
for
them
to
be
glad
to
see
you
and
better
not
show
yourself
in
public
you
been
well
fed
you
be
hated
for
that
maril
began
to
cry
murgatroyd
said
bewilderedly
chee
calhoun
held
him
close
there
was
confusion
and
calhoun
found
the
minister
of
health
at
hand
he
looked
most
harried
of
all
the
officials
gathered
to
question
calhoun
he
proposed
that
he
get
a
look
at
the
hospital
situation
right
away
it
was
practical
with
all
the
population
on
half
rations
or
less
when
night
came
people
needed
to
sleep
most
people
indeed
slept
as
many
hours
out
of
the
traditional
as
they
could
manage
it
was
much
more
pleasant
to
sleep
than
to
be
awake
and
constantly
nagged
at
by
continued
hunger
and
there
was
the
matter
of
simple
decency
continuous
gnawing
hunger
had
an
embittering
effect
upon
everyone
quarrelsomeness
was
a
common
experience
and
people
who
would
normally
be
the
leaders
of
opinion
felt
shame
because
they
were
obsessed
by
thoughts
of
food
it
was
best
when
people
slept
still
calhoun
was
in
the
hospitals
by
daybreak
what
he
found
moved
him
to
savage
anger
there
were
too
many
sick
children
in
every
case
undernourishment
contributed
to
their
sickness
and
there
was
not
enough
food
to
make
them
well
doctors
and
nurses
denied
themselves
food
to
spare
it
for
their
patients
and
most
of
that
was
doubtless
voluntary
but
it
would
not
be
discreet
for
anybody
on
dara
to
look
conspicuously
better
fed
than
his
fellows
calhoun
brought
out
hormones
and
enzymes
and
medicaments
from
the
med
ship
while
the
guard
in
the
ship
looked
on
he
demonstrated
the
processes
of
synthesis
and
that
enabled
such
small
samples
to
be
multiplied
indefinitely
he
was
annoyed
by
a
clamorous
appetite
there
were
some
doctors
who
ignored
the
irony
of
medical
techniques
being
taught
to
cure
nonnutritional
disease
when
everybody
was
or
less
they
approved
of
calhoun
they
even
approved
of
murgatroyd
when
calhoun
explained
his
function
he
was
of
course
a
med
service
and
were
creatures
of
talent
they
originally
been
found
on
a
planet
in
the
deneb
area
and
they
were
engaging
and
friendly
small
animals
but
the
remarkable
fact
about
them
was
that
they
could
contract
any
disease
not
any
they
had
a
explosive
reaction
to
bacterial
and
viral
toxins
and
there
had
yet
been
any
pathogenic
organism
discovered
to
which
a
could
not
more
or
less
immediately
develop
antibody
resistance
so
that
in
interstellar
medicine
were
priceless
let
murgatroyd
be
infected
with
however
localized
however
specialized
an
inimical
organism
and
presently
some
highly
valuable
defensive
substance
could
be
isolated
from
his
blood
and
he
remain
in
his
usual
exuberant
good
health
when
the
antibody
was
analyzed
by
those
techniques
of
microanalysis
the
service
had
developed
that
was
that
the
antibody
could
be
synthesized
and
one
could
attack
any
epidemic
with
confidence
the
tragedy
for
dara
was
of
course
that
no
med
ship
had
come
to
dara
three
generations
ago
when
the
dara
plague
raged
worse
after
the
plague
weald
was
able
to
exert
pressure
which
only
a
criminally
incompetent
med
service
director
would
have
permitted
but
criminal
incompetence
and
its
consequences
was
what
calhoun
had
been
loaned
to
sector
twelve
to
help
remedy
he
was
not
at
ease
though
no
ship
arrived
from
orede
to
bear
out
his
account
of
an
attempt
to
get
that
lonely
world
evacuated
before
weald
discovered
it
had
blueskins
on
it
maril
had
vanished
to
visit
or
return
to
her
family
or
perhaps
to
consult
with
the
mysterious
korvan
who
arranged
for
her
to
leave
dara
to
be
a
spy
and
had
advised
her
simply
to
make
a
new
life
somewhere
else
abandoning
a
despised
and
world
calhoun
had
learned
of
two
achievements
the
same
korvan
had
made
for
his
world
neither
was
remarkably
constructive
he
offered
to
prove
the
value
of
the
second
by
dying
of
it
which
might
make
him
a
very
admirable
character
or
he
could
have
a
passion
for
martyrdom
which
is
much
more
common
than
most
people
think
in
two
days
calhoun
was
irritable
enough
from
unaccustomed
hunger
to
suspect
the
worst
of
him
meanwhile
calhoun
worked
doggedly
in
the
hospitals
while
the
patients
were
awake
and
in
the
med
ship
under
guard
afterward
he
had
hunger
cramps
now
but
he
tested
a
plastic
cube
with
a
thriving
biological
culture
in
it
he
worked
at
increasing
his
store
of
it
he
snipped
samples
of
pigmented
skin
from
dead
patients
in
the
hospitals
and
examined
the
pigmented
areas
and
very
very
painstakingly
verified
a
theory
it
took
an
electron
microscope
to
do
it
but
he
found
a
virus
in
the
blue
patches
which
matched
the
type
discovered
on
tralee
the
tralee
viruses
had
effects
which
were
passed
on
from
mother
to
child
and
heredity
had
been
charged
with
the
observed
results
of
viral
particles
and
then
calhoun
very
very
carefully
introduced
into
a
virus
culture
the
material
he
had
been
growing
in
a
plastic
cube
he
watched
what
happened
he
was
satisfied
so
much
so
that
immediately
afterward
he
yawned
and
yawned
and
barely
managed
to
stagger
off
to
bed
the
watching
guard
in
the
med
ship
watched
him
in
amazement
that
night
the
ship
from
orede
came
in
packed
with
frozen
bloody
carcasses
of
cattle
calhoun
knew
nothing
of
it
but
next
morning
maril
came
back
there
were
shadows
under
her
eyes
and
her
expression
was
of
someone
who
has
lost
everything
that
had
meaning
in
her
life
i
all
right
she
insisted
when
calhoun
commented
i
been
visiting
my
family
i
seen
korvan
i
quite
all
right
you
have
eaten
any
better
than
i
have
calhoun
observed
i
could
admitted
maril
my
sisters
my
little
sisters
so
thin
there
rationing
for
everybody
and
it
all
efficiently
arranged
they
even
had
rations
for
me
but
i
could
eat
i
gave
most
of
my
food
to
my
sisters
and
they
they
squabbled
over
it
calhoun
said
nothing
there
was
nothing
to
say
then
she
said
in
a
no
less
desolate
tone
korvan
said
i
was
foolish
to
come
back
he
could
be
right
said
calhoun
but
i
had
to
protested
maril
and
now
i
i
been
eating
all
i
wanted
to
in
weald
and
in
the
ship
and
i
ashamed
because
and
i
not
and
when
you
see
what
hunger
does
to
them
it
terrible
to
be
and
not
able
to
think
of
anything
but
food
i
hope
said
calhoun
to
do
something
about
that
if
i
can
get
hold
of
an
astrogator
or
two
the
ship
that
was
on
orede
came
in
during
the
night
maril
told
him
shakily
it
was
loaded
with
frozen
meat
but
one
load
not
enough
to
make
a
difference
on
a
whole
planet
and
if
weald
hunts
for
us
on
orede
we
dare
go
back
for
more
meat
she
said
abruptly
there
are
some
prisoners
they
were
miners
they
were
crowded
out
of
the
ship
the
darians
who
stampeded
the
cattle
took
them
prisoners
they
had
to
true
said
calhoun
it
would
have
been
wise
to
leave
wealdians
around
on
orede
with
their
throats
cut
or
living
either
to
tell
about
a
rumor
of
blueskins
even
if
their
throats
will
be
cut
now
is
that
the
program
maril
shivered
no
they
be
put
on
short
rations
like
everybody
else
and
people
will
watch
them
the
wealdians
expect
to
die
of
plague
any
minute
because
they
been
with
darians
so
people
look
at
them
and
laugh
but
it
not
very
funny
it
natural
said
calhoun
but
perhaps
lacking
in
charity
look
there
how
about
those
astrogators
i
need
them
for
a
job
i
have
in
mind
maril
wrung
her
hands
c
come
here
she
said
in
a
low
tone
there
was
an
armed
guard
in
the
control
room
of
the
ship
he
watched
calhoun
a
good
part
of
the
previous
day
as
calhoun
performed
his
mysterious
work
he
been
and
now
was
on
duty
again
he
was
bored
so
long
as
calhoun
did
not
touch
the
control
board
though
he
was
uninterested
he
did
even
turn
his
head
when
maril
led
the
way
into
the
other
cabin
and
slid
the
door
shut
the
astrogators
are
coming
she
said
swiftly
they
bring
some
boxes
with
them
they
ask
you
to
instruct
them
so
they
can
handle
our
ship
better
they
lost
themselves
coming
back
from
orede
no
they
did
lose
themselves
but
they
lost
time
enough
time
almost
to
make
an
extra
trip
for
meat
they
need
to
be
experts
i
to
come
along
so
they
can
be
sure
that
what
you
teach
them
is
what
been
doing
right
along
calhoun
said
well
they
crazy
said
maril
vehemently
they
knew
weald
would
do
something
monstrous
sooner
or
later
but
they
going
to
try
to
stop
it
by
being
more
monstrous
sooner
not
everybody
agrees
but
there
are
enough
so
they
want
to
use
your
ship
it
faster
in
overdrive
and
so
on
and
they
go
to
weald
in
this
ship
and
they
say
they
give
weald
something
to
keep
it
busy
without
bothering
us
calhoun
said
dryly
this
pays
me
off
for
being
too
sympathetic
with
blueskins
but
if
i
been
hungry
for
a
couple
of
years
and
was
despised
to
boot
by
the
people
who
kept
me
hungry
i
suppose
i
might
react
the
same
way
no
he
said
curtly
as
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
again
do
tell
me
the
trick
considering
everything
only
one
trick
it
could
be
but
i
doubt
profoundly
that
it
would
work
all
right
he
slid
the
door
back
and
returned
to
the
control
room
maril
followed
him
he
said
detachedly
i
been
working
on
a
problem
outside
of
the
food
one
it
is
the
time
to
talk
about
it
right
now
but
i
think
i
solved
it
maril
turned
her
head
listening
there
were
footsteps
on
the
tarmac
outside
the
ship
both
doors
of
the
airlock
were
open
four
men
came
in
they
were
young
men
who
did
not
look
quite
as
hungry
as
most
darians
but
there
was
a
reason
for
that
their
leader
introduced
himself
and
the
others
they
were
the
astrogators
of
the
ship
dara
had
built
to
try
to
bring
food
from
orede
they
were
not
said
their
leader
good
enough
they
overshot
their
destination
they
came
out
of
overdrive
too
far
off
line
they
needed
instruction
calhoun
nodded
and
observed
that
he
been
asking
for
them
they
were
of
course
blueskins
on
one
the
only
visible
disfigurement
was
a
patch
of
blue
upon
his
wrist
on
another
the
appearance
of
a
blue
birthmark
appeared
beside
his
eye
and
went
back
and
up
his
temple
a
third
had
a
white
patch
on
his
temple
with
all
the
rest
of
his
face
a
dull
blue
the
fourth
had
blue
fingers
on
one
hand
we
got
orders
said
their
leader
steadily
to
come
on
board
and
learn
from
you
how
to
handle
this
ship
it
better
than
the
one
got
i
asked
for
you
repeated
calhoun
i
an
idea
i
explain
as
we
go
along
those
boxes
someone
was
passing
in
iron
boxes
through
the
airlock
one
of
the
four
very
carefully
brought
them
inside
they
rations
said
a
second
young
man
we
do
go
anywhere
without
rations
except
orede
orede
yes
i
think
we
were
shooting
at
each
other
there
said
calhoun
pleasantly
were
we
yes
said
the
young
man
he
was
neither
cordial
nor
antagonistic
he
was
impassive
calhoun
shrugged
then
we
can
take
off
immediately
here
the
communicator
and
the
button
you
might
call
the
grid
and
arrange
for
us
to
be
lifted
the
young
man
seated
himself
at
the
control
board
very
professionally
he
went
through
the
routine
of
preparing
to
lift
by
which
routine
has
not
changed
in
two
hundred
years
he
went
briskly
ahead
until
the
order
to
lift
then
calhoun
stopped
him
hold
it
he
pointed
to
the
airlock
both
doors
were
open
the
young
man
at
the
control
board
flushed
vividly
one
of
the
others
closed
and
dogged
the
doors
the
ship
lifted
calhoun
watched
with
seeming
negligence
but
he
found
occasion
for
a
dozen
corrections
of
procedure
this
was
presumably
a
training
voyage
of
his
own
suggestion
therefore
when
the
blueskin
pilot
would
have
flung
the
med
ship
into
undirected
overdrive
calhoun
grew
stern
he
insisted
on
a
destination
he
suggested
weald
the
young
men
glanced
at
each
other
and
accepted
the
suggestion
he
made
the
acting
pilot
look
up
the
intrinsic
brightness
of
its
sun
and
measure
its
apparent
brightness
from
just
off
dara
he
made
him
estimate
the
change
in
brightness
to
be
expected
after
so
many
hours
in
overdrive
if
one
broke
out
to
measure
the
first
blueskin
student
pilot
ended
a
tour
of
duty
with
more
respect
for
calhoun
then
he
had
at
the
beginning
the
second
was
anxious
to
show
up
better
than
the
first
calhoun
drilled
him
in
the
use
of
by
which
the
changes
in
apparent
brightness
of
stars
between
overdrive
hops
could
be
correlated
with
angular
changes
to
give
a
picture
of
the
nearer
heavens
it
was
a
highly
necessary
art
which
had
not
been
worked
out
on
dara
and
the
prospective
astrogators
became
absorbed
in
this
and
other
fine
points
of
they
done
enough
in
a
few
trips
to
orede
to
realize
that
they
needed
to
know
more
calhoun
showed
them
calhoun
did
not
try
to
make
things
easy
for
them
he
was
hungry
and
easily
annoyed
it
was
sound
training
tactics
to
be
severe
and
to
phrase
all
suggestions
as
commands
he
put
the
four
young
men
in
command
of
the
ship
in
turn
under
his
direction
he
continued
to
use
weald
as
a
destination
but
he
set
up
problems
in
which
the
med
ship
came
out
of
overdrive
pointing
in
an
unknown
direction
and
with
a
precessory
motion
he
made
the
third
of
his
students
identify
weald
in
the
celestial
globe
containing
hundreds
of
millions
of
stars
and
get
on
course
in
overdrive
toward
it
the
fourth
was
suddenly
required
to
compute
the
distance
to
weald
from
such
data
as
he
could
get
from
observation
without
reference
to
any
records
by
this
time
the
first
man
was
chafing
to
take
a
second
turn
calhoun
gave
each
of
them
a
second
gruelling
lesson
he
gave
them
in
fact
a
highly
condensed
but
very
sound
course
in
the
art
of
travel
in
space
his
young
students
took
command
in
watches
with
at
least
one
breakout
from
overdrive
in
each
watch
he
built
up
enthusiasm
in
them
they
ignored
the
discomfort
of
being
hungry
though
there
had
been
no
reason
for
them
to
stint
on
food
on
orede
in
growing
pride
in
what
they
came
to
know
when
weald
was
a
star
the
four
were
not
highly
qualified
astrogators
to
be
sure
but
they
were
vastly
better
spacemen
than
at
the
beginning
inevitably
their
attitude
toward
calhoun
was
respectful
he
been
irritable
and
right
to
the
young
the
combination
is
impressive
maril
had
served
as
passenger
only
in
theory
she
was
to
compare
calhoun
lessons
with
his
practise
when
alone
but
he
did
nothing
on
this
journey
which
teaching
considered
was
different
from
the
two
interstellar
journeys
maril
had
made
with
him
she
occupied
the
sleeping
cabin
during
two
of
the
six
watches
of
each
she
operated
the
which
was
almost
completely
emptied
of
its
original
store
of
food
it
having
been
confiscated
by
the
government
of
dara
that
amount
of
food
would
make
no
difference
to
the
planet
but
it
was
wise
for
everyone
on
dara
to
be
equally
on
the
sixth
day
out
from
dara
the
sun
of
weald
had
a
magnitude
of
minus
the
electron
telescope
could
detect
its
larger
planets
especially
a
world
of
high
albedo
calhoun
had
his
four
students
estimate
its
distance
again
pointing
out
the
difference
that
could
be
made
in
breakout
position
if
the
med
ship
were
by
as
much
as
one
second
of
arc
and
now
he
said
briskly
we
have
coffee
i
going
to
graduate
you
as
pilots
maril
four
cups
of
coffee
please
murgatroyd
said
the
med
ship
was
badly
crowded
with
six
humans
and
murgatroyd
in
a
space
intended
for
calhoun
and
murgatroyd
alone
the
little
had
spent
most
of
his
time
in
his
cubbyhole
watching
with
beady
eyes
as
so
many
people
moved
about
on
what
had
been
a
spacious
ship
before
no
coffee
for
you
murgatroyd
said
calhoun
you
did
do
your
lessons
this
is
for
the
graduating
class
only
murgatroyd
came
out
of
his
miniature
den
he
found
his
little
cup
and
offered
it
insistently
saying
chee
chee
no
said
calhoun
firmly
he
regarded
his
class
of
four
young
men
with
their
blueskin
markings
drink
it
down
he
commanded
the
last
order
i
give
you
you
graduate
pilots
now
they
drank
the
coffee
with
a
flourish
there
was
not
one
who
did
not
admire
calhoun
for
having
made
them
admire
themselves
they
were
actually
almost
as
much
better
pilots
as
they
believed
and
now
said
calhoun
i
suppose
you
tell
me
the
truth
about
those
boxes
you
brought
on
board
you
said
they
were
rations
but
they
have
been
opened
in
six
days
i
have
an
idea
what
they
mean
but
you
tell
me
the
four
looked
uncomfortable
there
was
a
long
pause
they
could
be
said
calhoun
detachedly
cultures
to
be
dumped
on
weald
weald
is
making
plans
to
wipe
out
dara
so
some
fool
has
decided
to
get
weald
too
busy
fighting
a
plague
of
its
own
to
bother
with
you
is
that
right
the
young
men
stirred
unhappily
young
men
can
very
easily
be
made
into
fanatics
but
they
have
to
be
kept
stirred
up
they
ca
be
provided
with
sound
reason
for
on
the
med
ship
not
been
a
single
reference
to
weald
except
as
an
object
toward
which
the
med
ship
was
being
astrogated
there
been
no
reference
to
blueskins
or
enemies
or
threats
or
anything
but
the
four
young
men
were
now
fanatical
about
the
proper
handling
of
a
ship
in
emptiness
well
sir
said
one
of
them
unhappily
that
what
we
were
ordered
to
do
i
object
said
calhoun
it
would
work
i
just
left
weald
a
little
while
back
remember
they
been
telling
themselves
that
some
day
dara
would
try
that
they
made
preparations
to
fight
any
imaginable
contagion
you
could
drop
on
them
every
so
often
somebody
claims
it
happening
it
would
work
i
object
but
in
fact
said
calhoun
i
forbid
it
i
shall
prevent
it
you
do
anything
of
the
kind
one
of
the
young
men
staring
at
calhoun
nodded
suddenly
his
eyes
closed
he
jerked
his
head
erect
and
looked
bewildered
a
second
sank
heavily
into
a
chair
he
said
remotely
thish
sfunny
and
abruptly
went
to
sleep
the
third
found
his
knees
giving
way
he
paid
elaborate
attention
to
them
stiffening
them
but
they
yielded
like
rubber
and
he
went
slowly
down
to
the
floor
the
fourth
said
thickly
and
reproachfully
thought
our
frien
he
collapsed
calhoun
very
soberly
tied
them
hand
and
foot
and
laid
them
out
comfortably
on
the
floor
maril
watched
her
hand
to
her
throat
murgatroyd
looked
agitated
he
said
anxiously
chee
no
said
calhoun
they
wake
up
presently
maril
said
in
a
tense
and
desperate
whisper
you
betraying
us
you
going
to
take
us
to
weald
no
said
calhoun
we
only
orbit
around
it
first
though
i
want
to
get
rid
of
those
damned
cultures
they
dead
by
the
way
i
killed
them
with
a
couple
of
days
ago
while
a
fine
argument
was
going
on
about
by
variable
cepheids
of
known
period
he
put
the
four
boxes
carefully
in
the
disposal
unit
he
operated
it
the
boxes
and
their
contents
streamed
out
to
space
in
the
form
of
metallic
and
other
vapors
calhoun
sat
at
the
control
desk
i
a
med
service
man
he
said
detachedly
i
could
cooperate
in
the
spread
of
plagues
anyhow
though
a
useful
epidemic
might
be
another
matter
but
the
important
thing
right
now
is
not
keeping
weald
busy
with
troubles
to
increase
their
hatred
of
dara
it
getting
some
food
for
dara
and
driblets
wo
help
what
needed
is
thousands
of
tons
or
tens
of
thousands
then
he
said
overdrive
coming
murgatroyd
hold
fast
the
universe
vanished
the
customary
unpleasant
sensations
accompanied
the
change
murgatroyd
burped
a
large
part
of
the
firmament
was
blotted
out
by
the
blindingly
bright
of
weald
as
it
shone
in
the
sunshine
it
had
icecaps
at
its
poles
and
there
were
seas
and
the
mottled
look
of
land
which
had
that
carefully
maintained
balance
of
woodland
and
cultivated
areas
which
was
so
effective
in
climate
control
the
med
ship
floated
free
and
calhoun
fretfully
monitored
all
the
beacon
frequencies
known
to
man
there
was
relative
silence
inside
the
ship
maril
watched
calhoun
in
a
sort
of
despairing
indecision
the
four
young
blueskins
still
slept
still
bound
hand
and
foot
upon
the
control
room
floor
murgatroyd
regarded
them
and
maril
and
calhoun
in
turn
and
his
small
and
furry
forehead
wrinkled
helplessly
they
ca
have
landed
what
i
looking
for
protested
calhoun
as
his
search
had
no
result
they
ca
it
would
be
too
sensible
for
them
to
have
done
it
murgatroyd
said
in
a
subdued
voice
but
where
the
devil
did
they
put
them
demanded
calhoun
a
polar
orbit
would
be
ridiculous
they
then
he
grunted
in
disgust
oh
of
course
now
where
the
he
worked
busily
for
minutes
checking
the
position
of
the
wealdian
which
was
mapped
in
the
sector
directory
against
the
look
of
continents
and
seas
on
the
so
plainly
visible
outside
he
found
what
he
wanted
he
put
on
the
ship
solar
system
drive
i
wish
he
complained
to
maril
i
wish
i
could
think
straight
the
first
time
and
it
so
obvious
if
you
want
to
put
something
out
in
space
and
not
have
it
interfere
with
traffic
in
what
sort
of
orbit
and
at
what
distance
will
you
put
it
maril
did
not
answer
obviously
said
calhoun
you
put
it
as
far
as
possible
from
the
of
ships
coming
in
to
the
spaceport
you
put
it
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
planet
and
you
want
it
to
stay
out
of
the
way
where
anybody
can
know
it
is
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
without
having
to
calculate
anything
so
you
put
it
out
in
orbit
so
it
will
revolve
around
weald
in
exactly
one
day
neither
more
nor
less
and
you
put
it
above
the
equator
and
then
it
will
remain
quite
stationary
above
one
spot
on
the
planet
a
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
longitude
away
from
the
and
directly
over
the
equator
he
scribbled
for
a
moment
which
means
thousand
miles
high
give
or
take
a
few
hundred
and
here
and
i
was
hunting
for
it
in
a
orbit
he
grumbled
to
himself
he
waited
while
the
drive
pushed
the
med
ship
a
quarter
of
the
way
around
the
bright
planet
below
the
sunset
line
vanished
and
the
planet
disk
became
a
complete
circle
then
calhoun
listened
to
the
monitor
earphones
again
and
grunted
once
more
and
changed
course
and
presently
made
a
noise
indicating
satisfaction
he
abandoned
instrument
control
and
peered
directly
out
of
a
port
handling
the
solar
system
drive
with
great
care
murgatroyd
said
depressedly
stop
worrying
commanded
calhoun
we
have
been
challenged
and
there
is
a
beacon
transmitter
at
work
just
to
make
sure
that
nobody
bumps
into
what
we
looking
for
it
a
great
help
because
we
do
want
to
bump
but
gently
stars
swung
across
the
port
out
of
which
he
looked
something
dark
appeared
and
then
straight
lines
and
exact
curvings
even
maril
despairing
and
bewildered
as
she
was
caught
sight
of
something
vastly
larger
than
the
med
ship
floating
in
space
she
stared
the
med
ship
maneuvered
very
cautiously
she
saw
another
large
object
a
third
a
fourth
there
seemed
to
be
dozens
of
them
they
were
spaceships
huge
by
comparison
with
they
floated
as
the
med
ship
did
they
did
not
drive
they
were
not
in
formation
they
were
not
at
even
distances
from
each
other
they
did
not
point
in
the
same
direction
they
swung
in
emptiness
like
derelicts
calhoun
jockeyed
his
small
ship
with
infinite
care
presently
there
came
the
gentlest
of
impacts
and
then
a
clanking
sound
the
appearance
out
the
vision
port
became
stationary
but
still
unbelievable
the
med
ship
was
grappled
magnetically
to
a
vast
surface
of
welded
metal
calhoun
relaxed
he
opened
a
wall
panel
and
brought
out
a
vacuum
suit
he
began
briskly
to
get
it
on
things
moving
smoothly
he
commented
we
were
challenged
so
it
extremely
unlikely
that
we
were
spotted
our
friends
on
the
floor
ought
to
begin
to
come
to
shortly
and
i
going
to
find
out
now
whether
i
a
hero
or
in
trouble
maril
said
drearily
i
do
know
what
you
done
except
calhoun
blinked
at
her
in
the
act
of
hauling
the
vacuum
suit
up
his
chest
and
over
his
shoulders
is
it
he
demanded
i
been
giving
astrogation
lessons
to
these
characters
i
certainly
did
do
it
to
help
them
dump
on
weald
i
brought
them
here
do
you
see
the
point
these
are
space
ships
they
in
orbit
around
weald
not
manned
and
they
not
controlled
in
fact
they
nothing
but
storage
bins
he
seemed
to
consider
the
explanation
complete
he
wriggled
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
and
gloves
of
the
suit
he
slung
the
air
tanks
over
his
shoulder
and
hooked
them
to
the
suit
i
be
back
he
said
i
hope
with
good
news
i
reason
to
be
hopeful
though
because
these
wealdians
are
very
practical
men
they
have
things
all
prepared
and
tidy
i
suspect
i
find
these
ships
with
stores
of
air
and
fuel
maybe
even
food
so
that
if
weald
should
manage
to
make
a
deal
for
the
stuff
stored
out
here
in
them
only
have
to
bring
out
crews
he
lifted
the
space
helmet
down
from
its
rack
and
put
it
on
he
tested
it
reading
the
tank
and
other
data
from
the
lighted
miniature
instruments
visible
through
pinholes
above
his
he
fastened
a
space
rope
about
himself
speaking
through
the
helmet
opened
faceplate
if
our
friends
should
wake
up
before
i
get
back
he
added
please
restrain
them
i
hate
to
be
marooned
he
went
waddling
into
the
airlock
with
the
coil
of
space
rope
over
one
arm
the
inner
lock
door
closed
behind
him
a
little
later
maril
heard
the
outer
lock
open
then
silence
murgatroyd
whimpered
a
little
maril
shivered
calhoun
had
gone
out
of
the
ship
to
nothingness
he
said
that
what
he
was
looking
for
and
what
he
found
was
thousand
miles
from
weald
one
could
imagine
falling
thousand
miles
where
one
could
imagine
falling
a
calhoun
was
walking
on
the
steel
plates
of
a
gigantic
spaceship
which
floated
among
dozens
of
its
fellows
all
seeming
derelicts
and
seemingly
abandoned
he
was
able
to
walk
on
the
nearest
because
of
shoes
he
trusted
his
life
to
them
and
to
a
flimsy
space
rope
which
trailed
after
him
out
the
med
ship
airlock
time
passed
a
clock
ticked
in
that
hurried
tempo
of
five
ticks
to
the
second
which
has
been
the
habit
of
clocks
since
time
immemorial
very
small
and
trivial
noises
came
from
the
background
tape
preventing
utter
silence
from
hanging
intolerably
in
the
ship
maril
found
herself
listening
tensely
for
something
else
one
of
the
four
bound
blueskins
snored
and
stirred
and
slept
again
murgatroyd
gazed
about
unhappily
and
swung
down
to
the
control
room
floor
and
then
paused
for
lack
of
any
place
to
go
or
anything
to
do
he
sat
down
and
began
to
lick
his
whiskers
maril
stirred
murgatroyd
looked
at
her
hopefully
he
asked
shrilly
she
shook
her
head
it
became
a
habit
to
act
as
if
murgatroyd
were
a
human
being
no
she
said
unsteadily
not
yet
more
time
passed
an
unbearably
long
time
then
there
was
the
faintest
of
clankings
it
repeated
then
abruptly
there
were
noises
in
the
airlock
they
continued
they
were
fumbling
noises
the
outer
airlock
door
closed
the
inner
door
opened
dense
white
fog
came
out
of
it
there
was
motion
calhoun
followed
the
fog
out
of
the
lock
he
carried
objects
which
had
been
weightless
but
were
suddenly
heavy
in
the
ship
there
were
two
spacesuits
and
a
curious
assortment
of
parcels
he
spread
them
out
flipped
aside
his
faceplate
and
said
briskly
this
stuff
is
cold
turn
a
heater
on
it
will
you
maril
he
began
to
work
his
way
out
of
his
own
item
he
said
the
ships
are
fuelled
provisioned
a
practical
tribe
the
wealdians
the
ships
are
ready
to
take
off
as
soon
as
they
warmed
up
inside
a
sun
does
radiate
heat
enough
to
keep
a
ship
warm
when
the
rest
of
the
cosmos
is
effectively
near
zero
kelvin
here
point
the
heaters
like
this
he
adjusted
the
dispensers
the
fog
disappeared
where
their
beams
played
but
the
metal
spacesuits
glistened
and
steamed
and
the
steam
disappeared
within
inches
they
were
so
completely
and
utterly
cold
that
they
condensed
the
air
about
them
as
a
liquid
which
to
make
fog
which
warmed
up
and
disappeared
and
was
immediately
replaced
item
said
calhoun
again
getting
his
arms
out
of
the
sleeves
the
controls
are
pretty
nearly
standard
our
sleeping
friends
will
be
able
to
astrogate
them
back
to
dara
without
trouble
provided
only
that
nobody
comes
out
here
to
bother
us
before
they
leave
he
shed
the
last
of
the
spacesuit
stepping
out
of
its
legs
and
he
finished
wryly
i
brought
back
an
emergency
supply
of
ship
provisions
for
everybody
concerned
but
find
that
i
idiot
enough
to
feel
that
they
choke
me
if
i
eat
them
while
dara
still
starving
maril
said
but
there
is
any
hope
for
dara
no
real
hope
he
gaped
at
her
what
do
you
think
we
here
for
he
set
to
work
to
restore
his
four
recent
students
to
consciousness
it
was
not
a
difficult
task
the
dosage
mixed
in
the
coffee
given
them
as
a
graduation
ceremony
the
ceremony
which
had
consisted
solely
of
drinking
coffee
and
passing
out
allowed
for
processes
calhoun
took
the
precaution
of
disarming
them
first
but
presently
four
young
men
glared
at
him
i
calling
said
calhoun
holding
a
blaster
negligently
in
his
hand
i
calling
for
volunteers
there
a
famine
on
dara
been
unmanageable
crop
surpluses
on
weald
on
dara
the
government
grimly
rations
every
ounce
of
food
on
weald
the
government
has
been
buying
surplus
grain
to
keep
the
price
up
to
save
storage
costs
it
loaded
the
grain
into
spaceships
it
once
used
to
stand
sentry
over
dara
to
keep
it
out
of
space
when
there
was
another
famine
there
those
ships
have
been
put
out
in
orbit
where
we
hooked
on
to
one
of
them
it
loaded
with
half
a
million
bushels
of
grain
i
brought
spacesuits
from
it
i
turned
on
the
heaters
in
its
interior
and
i
set
its
overdrive
unit
for
a
hop
to
dara
now
i
calling
for
volunteers
to
take
half
a
million
bushels
of
grain
to
where
needed
do
i
get
any
volunteers
he
got
four
not
immediately
because
they
were
ashamed
that
he
made
it
impossible
to
carry
out
their
original
fanatic
plan
and
now
offered
something
much
better
to
make
up
for
it
they
raged
but
half
a
million
bushels
of
grain
meant
that
people
who
must
otherwise
die
might
live
ultimately
truculently
first
one
and
then
another
angrily
agreed
good
said
calhoun
now
how
many
of
you
dare
risk
the
trip
alone
i
got
one
grain
ship
warming
up
there
are
plenty
of
others
around
us
every
one
of
you
can
take
a
ship
and
half
a
million
bushels
to
dara
if
you
have
the
nerve
the
atmosphere
changed
suddenly
they
clamored
for
the
task
he
offered
them
they
were
still
acutely
uncomfortable
he
bossed
them
and
taught
them
until
they
felt
capable
and
glamorous
and
proud
then
pinned
their
ears
back
but
if
they
returned
to
dara
with
four
enemy
ships
and
unimaginable
quantities
of
food
with
which
to
break
the
famine
there
was
work
to
be
done
first
of
course
only
one
ship
was
so
far
warming
up
three
more
had
to
be
entered
in
spacesuits
and
each
had
to
have
its
interior
warmed
so
breathable
air
could
exist
inside
it
and
at
least
part
of
the
stored
provisions
had
to
be
brought
up
to
reasonable
temperature
for
use
on
the
journey
then
the
overdrive
unit
had
to
be
inspected
and
set
for
the
length
of
journey
that
a
direct
overdrive
hop
to
dara
would
mean
and
calhoun
had
to
make
sure
again
that
each
of
the
four
could
identify
dara
sun
under
all
circumstances
and
aim
for
it
with
the
requisite
high
precision
both
before
going
into
overdrive
and
after
breakout
when
all
that
was
accomplished
calhoun
might
reasonably
hope
that
arrive
but
it
was
a
certainty
still
presently
his
four
students
shook
hands
with
him
with
the
fine
tolerance
of
young
men
intending
much
greater
achievements
than
their
teacher
they
would
speak
on
communicator
again
because
their
messages
might
be
picked
up
on
weald
of
course
for
this
high
heroic
action
to
be
successful
it
had
to
be
performed
with
the
stealth
of
what
seemed
a
long
time
passed
the
one
ship
turned
slowly
upon
some
unseen
axis
it
wavered
back
and
forth
seeking
a
point
of
aim
a
second
twisted
in
its
place
a
third
put
on
the
barest
trace
of
solar
system
drive
to
get
clear
of
the
rest
the
fourth
one
ship
vanished
it
had
gone
into
overdrive
heading
for
dara
at
many
times
the
speed
of
light
another
two
more
that
was
all
the
remainder
of
the
fleet
hung
clumsily
in
emptiness
and
calhoun
worriedly
went
over
in
his
mind
the
lessons
he
given
in
such
a
pathetically
small
number
of
days
if
the
four
ships
reached
dara
their
pilots
would
be
heroes
calhoun
had
presented
them
with
that
estate
over
their
bitter
objection
but
they
would
glory
in
it
if
they
reached
dara
maril
looked
at
him
with
very
strange
eyes
now
what
she
asked
we
hang
around
said
calhoun
to
see
if
anybody
comes
up
from
weald
to
find
out
what
happened
it
always
possible
to
pick
up
a
sort
of
signal
when
a
ship
goes
into
overdrive
usually
it
does
mean
a
thing
nobody
pays
any
attention
but
if
somebody
comes
out
here
what
it
be
regrettable
said
calhoun
he
was
suddenly
very
tired
it
spoil
any
chance
of
our
coming
back
and
stealing
some
more
food
like
interstellar
mice
if
they
find
out
what
we
done
expect
us
to
try
it
again
they
might
get
set
to
fight
or
they
might
simply
land
the
rest
of
these
ships
if
i
realized
what
you
were
about
said
maril
i
have
joined
in
the
lessons
i
could
have
piloted
a
ship
you
would
have
wanted
to
said
calhoun
he
yawned
you
want
to
be
a
heroine
no
normal
girl
does
why
korvan
said
calhoun
he
yawned
again
i
asked
about
him
been
trying
very
desperately
to
deserve
well
of
his
fellow
blueskins
all
he
accomplished
is
develop
a
way
to
starve
painlessly
he
would
feel
comfortable
with
a
girl
who
helped
make
starving
unnecessary
he
admire
you
politely
but
he
never
marry
you
and
you
know
it
she
shook
her
head
but
it
was
not
easy
to
tell
whether
she
denied
the
reaction
of
korvan
whom
calhoun
had
never
met
or
denied
that
he
was
more
important
to
her
than
anything
else
the
last
was
what
calhoun
plainly
implied
you
do
seem
to
be
trying
to
be
a
hero
she
protested
i
enjoy
it
admitted
calhoun
but
i
have
a
job
to
do
it
got
to
be
done
it
more
important
than
being
admired
you
could
take
another
ship
back
she
told
him
it
would
be
worth
more
to
dara
than
the
med
ship
is
and
then
everybody
would
realize
that
you
planned
everything
ah
said
calhoun
but
you
no
idea
how
much
this
ship
matters
to
dara
he
seated
himself
at
the
controls
he
slipped
headphones
over
his
ears
he
listened
very
very
carefully
he
monitored
all
the
wave
lengths
and
wave
forms
he
could
discover
in
use
on
weald
there
was
no
mention
of
the
oddity
of
behavior
of
shiploads
of
surplus
grain
aloft
there
was
no
mention
of
the
ships
at
all
there
was
plenty
of
mention
of
dara
and
blueskins
and
of
the
vicious
political
fight
now
going
on
to
see
which
political
party
could
promise
the
most
complete
protection
against
blueskins
after
a
full
hour
of
it
calhoun
flipped
off
his
receptor
and
swung
the
med
ship
to
an
exact
painstakingly
precise
aim
at
the
sun
around
which
dara
rolled
he
said
overdrive
coming
murgatroyd
murgatroyd
grabbed
the
stars
went
out
and
the
universe
reeled
and
the
med
ship
became
a
sort
of
cosmos
all
its
own
into
which
no
signal
could
come
no
danger
could
enter
and
in
which
there
could
be
no
sound
except
those
minute
ones
made
to
prevent
silence
calhoun
yawned
again
now
there
nothing
to
be
done
for
a
day
or
two
he
said
wearily
and
i
beginning
to
understand
why
people
sleep
all
they
can
on
dara
it
one
way
not
to
feel
hungry
and
one
dreams
such
delicious
meals
but
looking
hungry
is
a
social
requirement
on
dara
maril
said
tensely
you
going
back
after
they
took
the
ship
from
you
the
job
not
finished
he
explained
not
even
the
famine
ended
and
the
famine
a
effect
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
a
blueskin
there
be
no
famine
food
could
be
traded
for
we
got
to
do
something
to
make
sure
there
are
no
more
famines
she
looked
at
him
oddly
it
would
be
desirable
she
said
with
irony
but
you
ca
do
it
not
today
no
he
admitted
then
he
said
longingly
i
did
get
much
sleep
on
the
way
here
while
running
a
seminar
on
astrogation
i
think
i
take
a
nap
she
rose
and
almost
ostentatiously
went
into
the
other
cabin
to
leave
him
alone
he
shrugged
he
settled
down
into
the
chair
which
to
let
a
med
ship
man
break
the
monotony
of
life
in
unchanging
surroundings
turned
into
a
comfortable
sleeping
arrangement
he
fell
instantly
asleep
for
very
many
then
there
was
no
action
or
activity
or
happening
of
any
imaginable
consequence
in
the
med
ship
very
very
far
away
distant
and
apart
four
shiploads
of
grain
hurtled
toward
the
planet
of
blueskins
each
great
ship
had
a
single
semiskilled
blueskin
for
pilot
and
crew
thousands
of
millions
of
suns
blazed
with
violence
appropriate
to
their
stellar
types
in
a
galaxy
of
which
a
very
small
proportion
had
been
explored
and
colonized
by
humanity
the
human
race
was
now
to
be
counted
in
quadrillions
on
scores
of
hundreds
of
inhabited
worlds
but
the
tiny
med
ship
seemed
the
least
significant
of
all
possible
created
things
it
could
travel
between
and
even
but
it
was
not
yet
capable
of
crossing
the
continent
of
suns
on
which
the
human
race
arose
and
between
any
two
solar
systems
the
journeying
of
the
med
ship
consumed
much
time
which
would
be
maddening
for
someone
with
no
work
to
do
or
no
resources
in
himself
or
herself
on
the
second
calhoun
labored
painstakingly
and
somewhat
distastefully
at
the
little
biological
laboratory
maril
watched
him
in
a
sort
of
brooding
silence
murgatroyd
slept
much
of
the
time
with
his
furry
tail
wrapped
meticulously
across
his
nose
toward
the
end
of
the
day
calhoun
finished
his
task
he
had
a
matter
of
six
or
seven
cubic
centimeters
of
clear
liquid
as
the
conclusion
of
a
long
process
of
culturing
and
examination
by
microscope
and
again
culturing
plus
final
filtration
he
looked
at
a
clock
and
calculated
time
better
wait
until
tomorrow
he
observed
and
put
the
bit
of
clear
liquid
in
a
place
of
safekeeping
what
is
it
asked
maril
what
it
for
it
part
of
a
job
i
have
on
hand
said
calhoun
he
considered
how
about
some
music
she
looked
astonished
but
he
set
up
an
instrument
and
fed
microtape
into
it
and
settled
back
to
listen
then
there
was
music
such
as
she
had
never
heard
before
it
was
another
device
to
counteract
isolation
and
monotonous
voyages
to
keep
it
from
losing
its
effectiveness
calhoun
rationed
himself
on
music
as
on
other
things
any
indulgence
frequently
repeated
would
become
a
habit
in
the
sense
that
it
would
give
no
special
pleasure
when
indulged
in
but
would
make
for
stress
if
it
were
omitted
calhoun
deliberately
went
for
weeks
between
uses
of
his
recordings
so
that
music
was
an
event
to
be
looked
forward
to
and
cherished
when
he
tapered
off
the
stirring
symphonies
of
kun
gee
with
tranquilizing
soothing
melodies
from
the
rim
school
of
composers
maril
regarded
him
with
a
very
peculiar
gaze
indeed
i
think
i
understand
now
she
said
slowly
why
you
do
act
like
other
people
toward
me
for
example
the
way
you
live
gives
you
what
other
people
have
to
get
in
crazy
ways
making
their
work
feed
their
vanity
and
justify
pride
and
make
them
feel
significant
but
you
can
put
your
whole
mind
on
your
work
he
thought
it
over
med
ship
routine
is
designed
to
keep
one
healthy
in
his
mind
he
admitted
it
works
pretty
well
it
satisfies
all
my
mental
appetites
but
there
are
instincts
she
waited
he
did
not
finish
what
do
you
do
about
the
instincts
that
work
and
music
and
such
things
ca
satisfy
calhoun
grinned
wryly
i
stern
with
them
i
have
to
be
he
stood
up
and
plainly
expected
her
to
go
into
the
other
cabin
for
the
night
she
went
it
was
after
breakfast
time
of
the
next
when
he
got
out
the
sample
of
clear
liquid
he
worked
so
long
to
produce
we
see
how
it
works
he
observed
murgatroyd
handy
in
case
of
a
it
perfectly
safe
so
long
as
he
aboard
and
there
are
only
the
two
of
us
she
watched
as
he
injected
half
a
cc
under
his
own
skin
then
she
shivered
a
little
what
will
it
do
that
remains
to
be
seen
he
paused
a
moment
you
and
i
he
said
with
some
dryness
make
a
perfect
test
for
anything
if
you
catch
something
from
me
it
will
be
infectious
indeed
she
gazed
at
him
utterly
without
comprehension
he
took
his
own
temperature
he
brought
out
the
folios
which
were
his
orders
covering
each
of
the
planets
he
should
give
a
standard
medical
service
inspection
weald
was
there
dara
was
but
a
med
service
man
has
much
freedom
of
action
even
when
only
keeping
up
the
routine
of
normal
med
service
when
catching
up
on
badly
neglected
operations
he
necessarily
has
much
more
calhoun
went
over
the
folios
two
hours
later
he
took
his
temperature
again
he
looked
pleased
he
made
an
entry
in
the
ship
log
two
hours
later
yet
he
found
himself
drinking
thirstily
and
looked
more
pleased
still
he
made
another
entry
in
the
log
and
drew
a
small
quantity
of
blood
from
his
own
vein
and
called
to
murgatroyd
murgatroyd
submitted
amiably
to
the
very
trivial
operation
calhoun
carried
out
calhoun
put
away
the
equipment
and
saw
maril
staring
at
him
with
a
certain
look
of
shock
it
does
hurt
him
calhoun
explained
right
after
he
born
there
a
tiny
spot
on
his
flank
that
has
the
desensitized
murgatroyd
all
right
that
what
he
for
but
he
your
friend
said
maril
murgatroyd
despite
his
small
size
and
furriness
had
all
the
human
attributes
an
animal
which
lives
with
humans
soon
acquires
calhoun
looked
at
him
with
affection
he
my
assistant
i
do
ask
anything
of
him
that
i
can
do
myself
but
we
both
med
service
and
i
do
things
for
him
that
he
ca
do
for
himself
for
example
i
make
coffee
for
him
murgatroyd
heard
the
familiar
word
he
said
very
well
agreed
calhoun
we
all
have
some
he
made
coffee
murgatroyd
sipped
at
the
cup
especially
made
for
his
little
paws
once
he
scratched
at
the
place
on
his
flank
which
had
no
pain
nerves
it
itched
but
he
was
perfectly
content
murgatroyd
would
always
be
contented
when
he
was
somewhere
near
calhoun
another
hour
went
by
murgatroyd
climbed
up
into
calhoun
lap
and
with
a
determined
air
went
to
sleep
there
calhoun
disturbed
him
long
enough
to
get
an
instrument
out
of
his
pocket
he
listened
to
murgatroyd
heartbeat
while
murgatroyd
dozed
maril
he
said
write
down
something
for
me
the
time
and
and
over
she
obeyed
not
comprehending
half
an
hour
later
still
not
stirring
to
disturb
murgatroyd
he
had
her
write
down
another
time
and
sequence
of
figures
only
slightly
different
from
the
first
half
an
hour
later
still
a
third
set
but
then
he
put
murgatroyd
down
well
satisfied
he
took
his
own
temperature
he
nodded
murgatroyd
and
i
have
one
more
chore
to
do
he
told
her
would
you
go
in
the
other
cabin
for
a
moment
disturbed
she
went
into
the
other
cabin
calhoun
drew
a
small
sample
of
blood
from
the
insensitive
area
on
murgatroyd
flank
murgatroyd
submitted
with
complete
confidence
in
the
man
in
ten
minutes
calhoun
had
diluted
the
sample
added
an
anticoagulant
shaken
it
up
thoroughly
and
filtered
it
to
clarity
with
all
red
and
white
corpuscles
removed
another
med
ship
man
would
have
considered
that
calhoun
had
had
murgatroyd
prepare
a
splendid
small
sample
of
serum
in
case
something
got
out
of
hand
it
would
assuredly
take
care
of
two
patients
but
a
med
ship
man
would
also
have
known
that
it
was
simply
one
of
those
scrupulous
precautions
a
med
ship
man
takes
when
using
cultures
from
store
calhoun
put
the
sample
away
and
called
maril
back
it
was
nothing
he
explained
but
you
might
have
felt
uncomfortable
we
simply
had
a
bit
of
med
service
routine
that
had
to
be
gone
through
it
all
right
now
he
offered
no
further
explanation
she
said
i
fix
lunch
she
hesitated
you
brought
some
food
from
the
first
weald
ship
do
you
want
to
he
shook
his
head
i
squeamish
he
admitted
the
trouble
on
dara
is
med
service
fault
before
my
time
but
still
i
stick
to
rations
until
everybody
eats
he
watched
her
unobtrusively
as
the
day
went
on
presently
he
considered
that
she
was
slightly
flushed
shortly
after
the
evening
meal
of
singularly
unappetizing
darian
rations
she
drank
thirstily
he
did
not
comment
he
brought
out
cards
and
showed
her
a
complicated
game
of
solitaire
in
which
mental
arithmetic
and
expert
use
of
probability
increased
one
chance
of
winning
by
midnight
she
learned
the
game
and
played
it
absorbedly
calhoun
was
able
to
scrutinize
her
without
appearing
to
do
so
and
he
was
satisfied
again
when
he
mentioned
that
the
med
ship
should
arrive
off
dara
in
eight
hours
more
she
put
the
cards
away
and
went
into
the
other
cabin
calhoun
wrote
up
the
log
he
added
the
notes
that
maril
had
made
for
him
of
murgatroyd
pulse
and
blood
pressure
after
the
injection
of
the
same
culture
that
produced
fever
and
thirstiness
in
himself
and
later
without
contact
with
him
or
the
culture
in
maril
he
put
a
professional
comment
at
the
end
culture
seems
to
have
retained
its
normal
characteristics
during
long
storage
in
the
spore
state
it
received
and
reproduced
rapidly
i
injected
cc
under
my
skin
and
in
less
than
one
hour
my
temperature
was
an
hour
later
it
was
this
was
its
peak
it
immediately
returned
to
normal
the
only
other
observable
symptom
was
slightly
increased
thirst
bloodpressure
and
pulse
remained
normal
the
other
person
in
the
med
ship
displayed
the
same
symptoms
in
prompt
and
complete
repetition
without
physical
he
went
to
sleep
with
murgatroyd
curled
up
in
his
cubbyhole
his
tail
draped
carefully
over
his
nose
the
med
ship
broke
out
of
overdrive
at
hours
calhoun
made
contact
with
the
grid
and
was
promptly
lowered
to
the
ground
it
was
almost
two
hours
later
at
hours
when
the
people
of
dara
were
informed
by
broadcast
that
calhoun
was
to
be
executed
immediately
from
the
viewpoint
of
darians
who
were
also
blueskins
the
decision
of
calhoun
guilt
and
the
decision
to
execute
him
were
reasonable
enough
maril
protested
fiercely
and
her
testimony
agreed
with
calhoun
in
every
respect
but
from
a
blueskin
viewpoint
their
own
statements
were
damning
calhoun
had
taken
four
young
astrogators
to
space
they
were
the
only
semiskilled
space
pilots
dara
had
there
were
no
fully
qualified
men
calhoun
had
asked
for
them
and
taken
them
out
to
emptiness
and
there
he
had
instructed
them
in
modern
guidance
methods
for
ships
of
space
so
far
there
was
no
disagreement
he
proposed
to
make
them
more
competent
pilots
more
capable
of
driving
a
ship
to
orede
for
example
to
raid
the
enormous
cattle
herds
there
and
he
had
them
drive
the
med
ship
to
weald
against
which
there
could
be
no
objection
but
just
before
arrival
he
had
tricked
all
four
of
them
by
giving
them
drugged
coffee
he
destroyed
the
lethal
bacterial
cultures
been
ordered
to
dump
on
weald
then
he
sent
the
four
student
pilots
off
separately
so
he
and
maril
claimed
in
huge
ships
crammed
with
grain
but
those
ships
were
not
to
be
believed
in
anyhow
nobody
believed
in
shiploads
of
grain
to
be
had
for
the
taking
they
did
know
that
the
only
four
partially
experienced
space
pilots
on
dara
had
been
taken
away
and
by
calhoun
own
story
sent
out
of
the
ship
after
they
been
drugged
had
they
been
trained
and
had
they
been
helped
or
even
permitted
to
sow
the
seeds
of
plague
on
weald
and
had
they
come
back
prepared
to
pass
on
training
to
other
men
to
handle
other
space
ships
now
feverishly
being
built
in
hidden
places
on
dara
then
dara
might
have
a
chance
of
survival
but
a
space
battle
with
only
partly
trained
pilots
would
be
hazardous
at
best
with
no
trained
pilots
at
all
it
would
be
hopeless
so
calhoun
by
his
own
story
appeared
to
have
doomed
every
living
being
on
dara
to
massacre
from
the
bombs
of
weald
it
was
this
last
angle
which
destroyed
any
chance
of
anybody
believing
in
such
objects
as
ships
loaded
down
with
grain
calhoun
had
shattered
dara
feeble
hope
of
resistance
weald
had
some
ships
and
could
build
or
buy
others
faster
than
dara
could
hope
to
construct
them
equally
important
weald
had
a
plenitude
of
experienced
spacemen
to
man
some
ships
fully
and
train
the
crews
of
others
if
it
had
become
desperately
busy
fighting
plague
then
a
fleet
to
exterminate
life
on
dara
would
be
delayed
dara
might
have
gained
time
at
least
to
build
ships
which
could
ram
their
enemies
and
destroy
them
that
way
but
calhoun
had
made
it
impossible
if
he
told
the
truth
and
weald
already
had
a
fleet
of
huge
ships
which
only
needed
to
be
emptied
of
grain
and
filled
with
guns
and
men
then
dara
was
doomed
but
if
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
it
was
equally
doomed
by
his
actions
so
calhoun
would
be
killed
his
execution
was
to
take
place
in
the
open
space
of
the
with
vision
cameras
transmitting
the
sight
over
all
the
blueskin
planet
men
with
grisly
blue
blotches
on
their
skins
marched
him
to
the
center
of
the
largest
level
space
on
the
planet
which
was
not
desperately
being
cultivated
their
hatred
showed
in
their
expressions
bitterness
and
fury
surrounded
calhoun
like
a
wall
most
of
dara
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
him
killed
in
a
manner
as
atrocious
as
his
crime
but
no
conceivable
death
would
be
satisfying
so
the
affair
was
coldly
businesslike
with
not
even
insults
offered
to
him
he
was
left
to
stand
alone
in
the
very
center
of
the
floor
there
were
a
hundred
blasters
which
would
fire
upon
him
at
the
same
instant
he
would
not
only
be
killed
he
would
be
destroyed
he
would
be
vaporized
by
the
flames
poured
upon
him
his
death
was
remarkably
close
nothing
remaining
but
the
order
to
fire
when
loudspeakers
from
the
office
froze
everything
one
of
the
grain
ships
from
weald
had
broken
out
of
overdrive
and
its
pilot
was
triumphantly
calling
for
landing
coordinates
the
grid
office
relayed
his
call
to
loudspeaker
circuits
as
the
quickest
way
to
get
it
on
the
communication
system
of
the
whole
planet
calling
ground
boomed
the
triumphant
voice
of
the
first
of
the
student
pilots
calhoun
had
trained
calling
ground
pilot
franz
in
captured
ship
requests
coordinates
for
landing
purpose
of
landing
is
to
deliver
half
a
million
bushels
of
grain
captured
from
the
enemy
at
first
nobody
dared
believe
it
but
the
pilot
could
be
seen
on
vision
he
was
known
no
blueskin
would
be
left
alive
long
enough
to
be
used
as
a
decoy
by
the
men
of
weald
presently
the
giant
ship
on
its
second
voyage
to
dara
the
first
had
been
a
generation
ago
when
it
threatened
death
and
destruction
appeared
as
a
dark
pinpoint
in
the
sky
it
came
down
and
down
and
presently
it
hovered
over
the
center
of
the
tarmac
where
calhoun
composedly
stood
on
the
spot
where
he
was
to
have
been
executed
the
crew
shifted
the
ship
to
one
side
and
only
then
did
calhoun
stroll
in
a
leisurely
fashion
toward
the
med
ship
by
the
grid
wall
the
big
ship
touched
ground
and
its
exit
port
revolved
and
opened
and
the
student
pilot
stood
there
grinning
and
heaving
out
handfuls
of
grain
there
was
a
swarming
yelling
deliriously
triumphant
crowd
then
where
only
minutes
before
there
been
a
mob
waiting
to
rejoice
when
calhoun
living
body
exploded
into
flame
they
no
longer
hated
calhoun
but
he
had
to
fight
his
way
to
the
med
ship
nevertheless
he
was
surrounded
by
ecstatically
admiring
citizens
of
dara
they
shouted
praise
and
rejoicing
in
his
ears
until
he
was
and
they
almost
tore
his
clothing
from
them
in
their
desire
to
touch
to
pat
to
assure
him
of
their
gratitude
and
affection
minutes
since
they
thirsted
for
his
blood
two
hours
after
the
first
ship
a
second
landed
dara
went
wild
again
four
hours
later
still
the
third
arrived
the
fourth
came
down
to
ground
on
the
following
day
when
calhoun
faced
the
executive
and
cabinet
of
dara
for
the
second
time
his
tone
and
manner
were
very
dry
now
he
said
curtly
i
would
like
a
few
more
astrogators
to
train
i
think
it
likely
that
we
can
raid
the
wealdian
grain
fleet
one
more
time
and
in
so
doing
get
the
beginning
of
a
fleet
for
defense
i
insist
however
that
it
must
not
be
used
in
combat
we
might
as
well
be
sensible
about
this
situation
after
all
four
shiploads
of
grain
wo
break
the
famine
they
help
a
lot
but
they
only
the
beginning
of
what
needed
for
a
planetary
population
how
much
grain
can
we
hope
for
demanded
a
man
with
a
blue
mark
covering
all
his
chin
calhoun
told
him
how
long
before
weald
can
have
a
fleet
overhead
dropping
fusion
bombs
demanded
another
grimly
calhoun
named
a
time
but
then
he
said
i
think
we
can
keep
them
from
dropping
bombs
if
we
can
get
the
grain
fleet
and
some
capable
astrogators
how
he
told
them
it
was
not
possible
to
tell
the
whole
story
of
what
he
considered
sensible
behavior
an
emotional
program
can
be
presented
and
accepted
immediately
a
plan
of
action
which
is
actually
intelligent
considering
all
elements
of
a
situation
has
to
be
accepted
piecemeal
even
so
the
military
men
growled
we
plenty
of
heavy
elements
said
one
if
we
used
our
brains
we
have
more
bombs
than
weald
can
hope
for
we
could
turn
that
whole
planet
into
a
smoking
cinder
which
said
calhoun
acidly
would
give
you
some
satisfaction
but
not
an
ounce
of
food
and
food
more
important
than
satisfaction
now
i
going
to
take
off
for
weald
again
i
want
somebody
to
build
an
emergency
device
for
my
ship
and
i
want
the
four
pilots
i
trained
and
twenty
more
candidates
and
i
like
to
have
some
decent
rations
the
last
trip
brought
back
two
million
bushels
of
grain
you
can
certainly
spare
adequate
food
for
twenty
men
for
a
few
days
it
took
some
time
to
get
the
special
device
constructed
but
the
med
ship
lifted
in
two
days
more
the
device
for
which
it
had
waited
was
simply
a
preventive
of
the
disaster
overtaking
the
ship
from
the
mine
on
orede
it
was
essentially
a
tank
of
liquid
oxygen
packed
in
the
space
from
which
stores
had
been
taken
away
when
the
ship
air
supply
was
pumped
past
it
first
moisture
and
then
froze
out
then
the
air
flowed
over
the
liquefied
oxygen
at
a
rate
to
replace
the
with
more
useful
breathing
material
then
the
moisture
was
restored
to
the
air
as
it
warmed
again
for
so
long
as
the
oxygen
lasted
fresh
air
for
any
number
of
men
could
be
kept
purified
and
breathable
the
med
ship
normal
equipment
could
take
care
of
no
more
than
ten
but
with
this
it
could
journey
to
weald
with
almost
any
complement
on
board
maril
stayed
on
dara
when
the
med
ship
left
murgatroyd
protested
shrilly
when
he
discovered
her
about
to
be
closed
out
by
the
closing
airlock
he
said
indignantly
chee
no
said
calhoun
we
be
crowded
enough
anyhow
we
see
her
later
he
nodded
to
one
of
the
first
four
student
pilots
who
crisply
made
contact
with
the
office
and
very
efficiently
supervised
as
the
grid
took
the
ship
up
the
other
three
of
the
four
men
explained
every
move
to
assigned
to
each
calhoun
moved
about
listening
and
making
certain
that
the
instruction
was
up
to
standard
he
felt
queer
acting
as
the
supervisor
of
an
educational
institution
in
space
he
did
not
like
it
there
were
men
beside
himself
crowded
into
the
med
ship
small
interior
they
got
in
each
other
way
they
trampled
on
each
other
there
was
always
somebody
eating
and
always
somebody
sleeping
and
there
was
no
need
whatever
for
the
background
tape
to
keep
the
ship
from
being
intolerably
quiet
but
the
air
system
worked
well
enough
except
once
when
the
reheating
unit
quit
and
the
air
inside
the
ship
went
down
below
freezing
before
the
trouble
could
be
found
and
corrected
the
journey
to
weald
this
time
took
seven
days
because
of
the
training
program
in
effect
calhoun
bit
his
nails
over
the
delay
but
it
was
necessary
for
each
of
the
students
to
make
his
own
on
weald
sun
and
compute
distances
and
for
each
of
them
to
practise
maneuverings
that
would
presently
be
called
for
calhoun
hoped
desperately
that
preparations
for
active
warfare
did
not
move
fast
on
weald
he
believed
however
that
in
the
absence
of
direct
news
from
dara
wealdian
officials
would
take
the
normal
course
of
politicos
they
had
proclaimed
the
ship
from
orede
an
attack
from
dara
therefore
they
would
specialize
on
defensive
measures
before
plumping
for
offense
they
get
patrol
ships
out
to
spot
invasion
ships
long
before
they
worked
on
a
fleet
to
destroy
the
blueskins
it
would
meet
the
public
demand
for
defense
calhoun
was
right
the
med
ship
made
its
final
approach
to
weald
under
calhoun
own
control
he
made
on
his
previous
journey
and
he
used
them
again
they
would
not
be
strictly
accurate
because
a
sunspot
could
knock
all
meaning
out
of
any
reading
beyond
two
decimal
places
but
the
first
breakout
was
just
far
enough
from
the
wealdian
system
for
calhoun
to
be
able
to
pick
out
its
planets
with
the
electron
telescope
at
maximum
magnification
he
could
aim
for
weald
itself
allowing
of
course
for
the
lag
in
the
apparent
motion
of
its
image
because
of
the
limited
speed
of
light
he
tried
the
briefest
of
overdrive
hops
and
came
out
within
the
solar
system
and
well
inside
any
watching
patrol
that
was
pure
fortune
it
continued
he
broken
through
the
screen
of
guard
ships
in
undetectable
overdrive
he
was
within
half
an
solar
system
drive
of
the
grain
fleet
there
was
no
alarm
at
first
of
course
radars
spotted
the
med
ship
as
an
object
but
nobody
paid
attention
it
was
not
headed
for
weald
it
was
probably
assumed
to
be
a
guard
boat
itself
such
mistakes
do
happen
again
from
the
storage
space
from
which
supplies
had
been
removed
calhoun
produced
vacuum
suits
the
four
first
students
went
out
each
escorting
a
neophyte
and
all
fastened
firmly
together
with
space
ropes
they
warmed
the
interiors
of
four
ships
and
went
on
to
others
presently
there
were
eight
ships
making
ready
for
an
interstellar
journey
each
with
a
scared
but
resolute
new
pilot
familiarizing
himself
with
its
controls
there
were
sixteen
ships
twenty
a
guard
ship
came
humming
out
from
weald
it
would
be
armed
of
course
it
came
droning
droning
up
the
thousand
miles
from
the
planet
calhoun
swore
he
could
not
call
his
students
and
tell
them
what
was
toward
the
guard
ship
would
overhear
he
could
not
trust
untried
young
men
to
act
rationally
if
they
were
unaware
and
the
guard
ship
arrived
and
attempted
to
board
one
of
them
then
he
was
inspired
he
called
murgatroyd
placed
him
before
the
communicator
and
set
it
at
transmission
this
was
familiar
enough
to
murgatroyd
he
often
seen
calhoun
use
a
communicator
shrilled
murgatroyd
a
startled
voice
came
out
of
the
speaker
what
that
said
murgatroyd
zestfully
the
communicator
was
talking
to
him
murgatroyd
adored
three
things
in
order
one
was
calhoun
the
second
was
coffee
the
third
was
pretending
to
converse
like
a
human
being
the
speaker
said
explosively
you
there
identify
yourself
observed
murgatroyd
he
wriggled
with
pleasure
and
added
reasonably
enough
the
communicator
bawled
calling
ground
calling
ground
listen
to
this
something
that
ai
human
talking
at
me
on
a
communicator
listen
in
an
tell
me
what
to
do
murgatroyd
interposed
with
another
shrill
then
calhoun
pulled
the
med
ship
slowly
away
from
the
clump
of
grain
ships
it
was
highly
improbable
that
the
guard
boat
would
carry
an
electron
telescope
most
likely
it
would
have
only
an
and
so
could
determine
only
that
an
object
of
some
sort
moved
of
its
own
accord
in
space
calhoun
let
the
med
ship
accelerate
that
would
be
final
evidence
the
grain
ships
were
between
weald
and
its
sun
even
electron
telescopes
on
the
ground
and
electron
telescopes
were
ultimately
optical
telescopes
with
electronic
amplification
could
not
get
a
good
image
of
the
ship
through
sunlit
atmosphere
asked
murgatroyd
solicitously
is
it
blueskins
shakily
demanded
the
voice
from
the
guard
boat
ground
ground
is
it
blueskins
a
heavy
authoritative
voice
came
in
with
much
greater
volume
no
human
voice
it
said
harshly
approach
its
ship
and
send
back
an
image
do
fire
first
unless
it
heads
for
ground
the
guard
ship
swerved
and
headed
for
the
med
ship
it
was
still
a
very
long
way
off
said
murgatroyd
encouragingly
calhoun
changed
the
med
ship
course
the
guard
ship
changed
course
too
calhoun
let
it
draw
nearer
but
only
a
little
he
led
it
away
from
the
fleet
of
grain
ships
he
swung
his
electron
telescope
on
them
he
saw
a
spacesuited
figure
outside
one
safely
roped
however
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
someone
had
meant
to
return
to
the
med
ship
for
orders
or
to
make
a
report
and
found
the
med
ship
gone
he
go
back
inside
and
turn
on
a
communicator
said
murgatroyd
the
heavy
voice
boomed
you
there
this
is
a
world
if
you
come
in
peace
cut
your
drive
and
let
our
guard
ship
approach
murgatroyd
replied
in
an
interested
but
doubtful
tone
the
booming
voice
bellowed
another
voice
of
higher
authority
took
over
murgatroyd
was
entranced
that
so
many
people
wanted
to
talk
to
him
he
made
what
for
him
was
practically
an
oration
the
last
voice
spoke
persuasively
and
suavely
said
murgatroyd
one
of
the
grain
ships
flickered
and
ceased
to
be
it
had
gone
into
overdrive
another
and
another
suddenly
they
began
to
flick
out
of
sight
by
twos
and
threes
said
murgatroyd
with
a
note
of
finality
the
last
grain
ship
vanished
calling
guard
ship
said
calhoun
dryly
this
is
med
ship
i
called
here
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
you
been
talking
to
my
murgatroyd
a
pause
a
blank
pause
then
profanity
of
deep
and
savage
intemperance
i
been
on
dara
said
calhoun
dead
silence
fell
there
a
famine
there
said
calhoun
deliberately
so
the
grain
ships
you
had
in
orbit
have
been
taken
away
by
men
from
dara
blueskins
if
you
like
to
feed
themselves
and
their
families
they
been
dying
of
hunger
and
they
do
like
it
there
was
a
single
burst
of
the
unprintable
then
the
formerly
suave
voice
said
waspishly
well
the
med
service
will
hear
of
your
interference
yes
said
calhoun
i
report
it
myself
i
have
a
message
for
you
dara
is
ready
to
pay
for
every
ounce
of
grain
and
for
the
ships
it
was
stored
in
they
pay
in
heavy
metals
irridium
uranium
that
sort
of
thing
the
suave
voice
fairly
curdled
as
if
we
allow
anything
that
was
ever
on
dara
to
touch
ground
here
ah
but
there
can
be
sterilization
to
begin
with
metals
uranium
melts
at
centigrade
and
tungsten
at
and
irridium
at
you
could
load
such
things
and
melt
them
down
in
space
and
then
tow
them
home
and
you
can
actually
sterilize
a
lot
of
other
useful
materials
the
suave
voice
was
infuriated
i
report
this
you
suffer
for
this
calhoun
said
pleasantly
i
sure
that
what
i
say
is
being
recorded
so
that
i
add
that
it
perfectly
practical
for
wealdians
to
land
on
dara
take
whatever
property
they
think
wise
to
pay
for
damage
done
by
blueskins
of
course
and
get
back
to
wealdian
ships
with
absolutely
no
danger
of
carrying
contagion
if
you
make
sure
the
recording
clear
he
described
clearly
and
specifically
exactly
how
a
man
could
be
outfitted
to
walk
into
any
area
of
any
conceivable
contagion
do
whatever
seemed
necessary
in
the
way
of
looting
but
calhoun
did
not
use
the
word
and
then
return
to
his
fellows
with
no
risk
whatever
of
bringing
back
infection
he
gave
exact
details
then
he
said
my
radar
says
you
four
ships
converging
on
me
to
blast
me
out
of
space
i
sign
off
the
med
ship
disappeared
from
normal
space
and
entered
that
improbably
stressed
area
of
extension
which
it
formed
about
itself
and
in
which
physical
constants
were
wildly
strange
for
one
thing
the
speed
of
light
in
space
had
not
been
measured
yet
it
was
too
high
for
another
a
ship
could
travel
very
many
times
miles
per
second
in
overdrive
the
med
ship
did
just
that
there
was
nobody
but
calhoun
and
murgatroyd
on
board
there
was
companionable
silence
with
only
the
small
sounds
which
one
did
not
often
notice
calhoun
luxuriated
in
regained
privacy
for
seven
days
he
had
other
human
beings
crowded
into
the
two
cabins
of
the
ship
with
never
so
much
as
one
yard
of
space
between
himself
and
someone
else
one
need
not
be
snobbish
to
wish
to
be
alone
sometimes
murgatroyd
licked
his
whiskers
thoughtfully
i
hope
said
calhoun
that
things
work
out
right
but
they
may
remember
on
dara
that
i
responsible
for
some
ten
million
bushels
of
grain
reaching
them
maybe
just
possibly
they
listen
to
me
and
act
sensibly
after
all
there
only
one
way
to
break
a
famine
not
with
ten
million
bushels
for
a
whole
planet
and
certainly
not
with
bombs
driving
direct
without
pausing
for
practising
the
med
ship
could
arrive
at
dara
in
a
little
more
than
five
days
calhoun
looked
forward
to
relaxation
as
a
beginning
he
made
ready
to
give
himself
an
adequate
meal
for
the
first
time
since
first
landing
on
dara
then
presently
he
sat
down
to
a
double
meal
of
darian
which
were
far
from
appetizing
but
there
was
anything
else
on
board
he
had
some
pleasure
later
though
envisioning
what
went
on
in
the
normal
universe
suns
flared
and
comets
hurtled
on
their
way
and
clouds
formed
and
dropped
down
rain
and
all
sorts
of
celestial
and
meteorological
phenomena
took
place
on
weald
obviously
there
would
be
purest
panic
the
vanishing
of
the
grain
fleet
would
be
charged
against
men
a
darian
fleet
would
be
suspected
and
with
the
suspicion
would
come
terror
and
with
terror
a
governmental
crisis
then
there
be
a
frantic
seizure
of
any
craft
that
could
take
to
space
and
the
agitated
improvisation
of
a
space
fleet
but
besides
that
technicians
would
examine
calhoun
instructions
for
equipment
by
which
armed
men
could
be
landed
on
a
planet
and
then
safely
taken
off
again
military
and
governmental
officials
would
come
to
the
eminently
sane
conclusion
that
while
calhoun
could
not
well
take
active
measures
against
blueskins
as
a
sane
and
proper
citizen
of
the
galaxy
he
would
be
on
the
side
of
law
and
order
and
propriety
and
justice
in
short
of
weald
so
they
ordered
sample
anticontagion
suits
made
according
to
calhoun
directions
and
they
had
them
tested
they
worked
admirably
on
dara
while
calhoun
journeyed
placidly
back
to
it
grain
was
distributed
lavishly
and
everybody
on
the
planet
had
their
cereal
ration
almost
doubled
it
was
still
not
a
comfortable
ration
but
the
relief
was
great
there
was
considerable
gratitude
felt
for
calhoun
which
as
usual
included
a
lively
anticipation
of
further
favors
to
come
maril
was
interviewed
repeatedly
as
the
person
best
able
to
discuss
him
and
she
did
his
reputation
no
harm
that
was
all
that
happened
on
dara
no
there
was
something
else
a
very
curious
thing
too
there
was
a
spread
of
mild
symptoms
which
nobody
could
exactly
call
a
disease
they
lasted
only
a
few
hours
a
person
felt
slightly
feverish
and
ran
a
temperature
which
peaked
at
centigrade
and
drank
more
water
than
usual
then
his
temperature
went
back
to
normal
and
he
forgot
all
about
it
there
have
always
been
such
trivial
epidemics
they
are
rarely
recorded
because
few
people
think
to
go
to
a
doctor
that
was
the
case
here
calhoun
looked
ahead
a
little
too
presently
the
fleet
of
grain
ships
would
arrive
and
unload
and
lift
again
for
orede
and
this
time
they
would
make
an
infinity
of
slaughter
among
wild
cattle
herds
and
bring
back
incredible
quantities
of
frozen
beef
almost
everybody
would
get
to
taste
meat
again
which
would
be
most
gratifying
then
the
industries
of
dara
would
labor
at
tasks
an
astonishing
amount
of
fissionable
material
would
be
fashioned
into
bombs
a
concession
by
calhoun
and
plastic
factories
would
make
an
astonishing
number
of
plastic
and
large
shipments
of
heavy
metals
in
ingots
would
be
made
to
the
planet
capital
city
and
there
would
be
some
guns
and
minor
items
perhaps
somebody
could
have
predicted
any
of
these
items
in
advance
but
it
was
unlikely
that
anyone
did
nobody
but
calhoun
however
would
ever
have
put
them
together
and
hoped
very
urgently
that
things
would
work
out
he
could
see
a
promising
total
result
in
fact
in
the
med
ship
hurtling
through
space
on
the
fourth
day
of
his
journey
he
thought
of
an
improvement
that
could
be
made
in
the
sum
of
all
those
happenings
when
they
got
mixed
together
he
got
back
to
dara
maril
came
to
the
med
ship
murgatroyd
greeted
her
with
enthusiasm
something
strange
has
happened
said
maril
very
much
subdued
i
told
you
that
sometimes
blueskin
markings
fade
out
on
children
and
then
neither
they
nor
their
children
ever
have
markings
again
yes
said
calhoun
i
remember
that
you
told
me
and
you
were
reminded
of
a
group
of
viruses
on
tralee
you
said
they
only
took
hold
of
people
in
terribly
bad
physical
condition
but
then
they
could
be
passed
on
from
mother
to
child
until
sometimes
they
died
out
calhoun
blinked
yes
korvan
said
maril
very
carefully
has
worked
out
an
idea
that
that
what
happens
to
the
blueskin
markings
on
darians
he
thinks
that
people
almost
dead
of
the
plague
could
get
the
virus
and
if
they
recovered
from
the
plague
pass
the
virus
on
and
be
blueskins
interesting
said
calhoun
noncommittally
and
when
we
went
to
weald
said
maril
very
carefully
indeed
you
were
working
with
some
culture
material
you
wrote
quite
a
lot
about
it
in
the
ship
log
you
gave
yourself
an
injection
remember
and
murgatroyd
you
wrote
down
your
temperature
and
murgatroyd
she
moistened
her
lips
you
said
that
if
infection
passed
between
us
something
would
be
very
infectious
indeed
this
is
a
long
discussion
said
calhoun
does
it
arrive
at
a
point
it
does
said
maril
thousands
of
people
are
having
their
fade
away
not
only
children
but
grownups
and
korvan
has
found
out
that
it
always
seems
to
happen
after
a
day
when
they
felt
feverish
and
very
thirsty
and
then
felt
all
right
again
you
tried
out
something
that
made
you
feverish
and
thirsty
i
had
it
too
in
the
ship
korvan
thinks
there
been
an
epidemic
of
something
that
is
obliterating
the
blue
spots
on
everybody
that
catches
it
there
are
always
trivial
epidemics
that
nobody
notices
korvan
found
evidence
of
one
that
making
no
longer
a
word
with
any
meaning
remarkable
said
calhoun
did
you
do
it
asked
maril
did
you
start
a
harmless
epidemic
that
wipes
out
the
virus
that
makes
blueskins
calhoun
said
in
feigned
astonishment
how
can
you
think
such
a
thing
maril
because
i
was
there
said
maril
she
said
somehow
desperately
i
know
you
did
it
but
the
question
is
are
you
going
to
tell
when
people
find
they
not
blueskins
any
longer
when
there
no
such
thing
as
a
blueskin
any
longer
will
you
tell
them
why
naturally
not
said
calhoun
why
then
he
guessed
has
korvan
he
thinks
said
maril
that
he
thought
it
up
all
by
himself
found
the
proof
he
very
proud
i
have
to
tell
him
how
the
ideas
got
into
his
head
if
you
were
going
to
tell
and
he
be
ashamed
and
angry
calhoun
considered
staring
at
her
how
it
happened
does
matter
he
said
at
last
the
idea
of
anybody
doing
it
deliberately
would
be
disturbing
too
it
get
about
so
it
seems
much
the
best
thing
for
korvan
to
discover
what
happened
to
the
blueskin
pigment
and
how
it
happened
but
not
why
she
read
his
face
carefully
you
are
doing
it
as
a
favor
to
me
she
decided
you
rather
it
was
that
way
she
looked
at
him
for
a
long
time
until
he
squirmed
then
she
nodded
and
went
away
an
hour
later
the
wealdian
space
fleet
was
reported
massed
in
space
and
driving
for
dara
there
were
small
scout
ships
which
came
on
ahead
of
the
main
fleet
they
originally
been
guard
boats
intended
for
solar
system
duty
only
and
quite
incapable
of
overdrive
they
come
from
weald
in
the
cargo
holds
of
the
liners
now
transformed
into
fighting
ships
the
scouts
swept
low
transmitting
images
back
to
the
fleet
of
all
they
might
see
before
they
were
shot
down
they
found
the
it
contained
nothing
larger
than
calhoun
med
ship
they
searched
here
and
there
they
flittered
to
and
fro
scanning
wide
bands
of
the
surface
of
dara
the
planet
cities
and
highways
and
industrial
centers
were
wholly
open
to
inspection
from
the
sky
it
looked
as
if
the
scouts
hunted
most
busily
for
the
fleet
of
former
grain
ships
which
calhoun
had
said
the
blueskins
had
seized
and
rushed
away
if
the
scouts
looked
for
them
they
did
not
find
them
dara
offered
no
opposition
to
the
ships
nothing
rose
to
space
to
oppose
or
to
resist
their
search
they
went
darting
over
every
portion
of
the
hungry
planet
land
and
seas
alike
and
there
was
no
sign
of
military
preparedness
against
their
coming
the
huge
ships
of
the
main
fleet
waited
while
the
scouts
reported
monotonously
that
they
saw
no
sign
of
the
stolen
fleet
but
the
stolen
fleet
was
the
only
means
by
which
the
planet
could
be
defended
there
could
be
no
point
in
a
pitched
battle
in
emptiness
but
a
fleet
with
a
planet
to
back
it
might
be
dangerous
hours
passed
the
wealdian
main
fleet
waited
there
was
no
offensive
movement
by
the
fleet
there
was
no
defensive
action
from
the
ground
with
certain
to
be
involved
in
any
actual
conflict
there
was
something
like
an
embarrassed
pause
the
wealdian
ships
were
ready
to
bomb
they
were
less
anxious
to
be
vaporized
by
possible
suicide
dashes
of
defending
ships
which
might
blow
themselves
up
near
contact
with
their
enemies
but
a
fleet
can
not
travel
some
through
space
to
make
a
mere
threat
and
the
wealdian
fleet
was
furnished
with
the
material
for
total
devastation
it
could
drop
bombs
from
hundreds
or
thousands
or
even
tens
of
thousands
of
miles
away
it
could
cover
the
world
of
dara
with
mushroom
clouds
springing
up
and
spreading
to
make
a
continuous
pall
of
products
and
they
could
settle
down
and
kill
every
living
thing
not
destroyed
by
the
explosions
themselves
even
the
creatures
of
the
deepest
oceans
would
die
of
deadly
fallout
particles
the
wealdian
fleet
contemplated
its
own
destructiveness
it
found
no
capacity
for
defense
on
dara
it
moved
forward
but
then
a
message
went
out
from
the
capital
city
of
dara
it
said
that
a
ship
in
overdrive
had
carried
word
to
a
darian
fleet
in
space
the
darian
fleet
now
hurtled
toward
weald
it
was
a
fleet
of
giant
ships
they
carried
bombs
in
quantities
unless
its
orders
were
countermanded
it
would
deliver
those
bombs
on
weald
set
to
explode
if
weald
bombed
dara
the
orders
could
not
be
withdrawn
so
weald
could
bomb
dara
it
could
destroy
all
life
on
the
pariah
planet
but
weald
would
die
with
it
the
fleet
ceased
its
advance
the
situation
was
a
stalemate
with
pure
desperation
on
one
side
and
pure
frustration
on
the
other
this
was
no
way
to
end
the
war
neither
planet
could
trust
the
other
even
for
minutes
if
they
did
not
destroy
each
other
simultaneously
as
now
was
possible
each
would
expect
the
other
to
launch
an
unwarned
attack
at
some
other
moment
ultimately
one
or
the
other
must
perish
and
the
survivor
would
be
the
one
most
skilled
in
treachery
but
then
the
pariah
planet
made
a
new
proposal
it
would
send
a
messenger
ship
to
stop
its
own
fleet
bombardment
if
weald
would
accept
payment
of
the
grain
ships
and
their
cargos
it
would
pay
in
ingots
of
irridium
and
uranium
and
tungsten
and
gold
if
weald
wished
it
for
all
damages
weald
might
claim
it
would
even
pay
indemnity
for
the
miners
of
orede
who
had
died
by
accident
but
perhaps
in
some
sense
through
its
fault
it
would
pay
but
if
it
were
bombed
weald
must
spout
atomic
fire
and
the
fleet
of
weald
would
have
no
home
planet
to
return
to
this
proposal
seemed
both
craven
and
foolish
it
would
allow
the
fleet
of
weald
to
loot
and
then
betray
dara
but
it
was
calhoun
idea
it
seemed
plausible
to
the
admirals
of
weald
they
felt
only
contempt
for
blueskins
contemptuously
they
accepted
the
the
broadcast
waves
of
dara
told
of
agreement
and
wild
and
fierce
resentment
filled
the
pariah
planet
people
there
was
almost
revolution
to
insist
upon
resistance
however
hopeless
and
however
fatal
but
not
all
of
dara
realized
that
a
vital
change
had
come
about
in
the
state
of
things
on
dara
the
enemy
fleet
had
not
a
hint
of
it
in
menacing
array
the
invading
fleet
spread
itself
about
the
skies
of
dara
well
beyond
the
atmosphere
harsh
voices
talked
with
increasing
arrogance
to
the
staff
a
monster
ship
of
weald
came
heavily
down
riding
the
it
touched
gently
its
occupants
were
apprehensive
but
hungry
for
the
loot
they
had
been
assured
was
theirs
the
ship
outer
hull
would
be
sterilized
before
it
returned
to
weald
of
course
and
there
was
adequate
protection
for
the
men
came
out
of
the
ship
ports
they
wore
the
double
transparent
calhoun
had
suggested
which
had
been
painstakingly
tested
and
which
were
perfect
protection
against
contagion
they
were
double
garments
of
plastic
with
air
tanks
inside
the
inner
flexible
envelope
men
wearing
such
could
walk
about
on
dara
they
could
work
on
dara
they
could
loot
with
impunity
and
all
contamination
must
remain
outside
the
suits
and
on
their
return
to
their
ships
they
would
simply
stand
in
the
airlocks
while
corrosive
gases
swirled
around
them
killing
any
possible
organism
of
disease
then
for
extra
assurance
when
air
from
weald
filled
the
airlock
again
the
men
would
burn
the
outer
plastic
covering
and
step
into
the
ship
without
ever
having
come
within
two
layers
of
plastic
of
infection
what
loot
they
gathered
obviously
could
be
decontaminated
before
it
was
returned
to
weald
metals
could
be
melted
if
necessary
gems
could
be
sterilized
it
was
a
most
satisfactory
discovery
to
realize
that
blueskins
could
be
not
only
scorned
but
robbed
there
was
only
one
bit
of
irrelevant
information
the
space
fleet
of
weald
did
not
have
that
information
was
that
the
people
of
dara
were
blueskins
any
longer
there
been
a
trivial
epidemic
the
men
of
weald
went
zestfully
about
their
business
they
took
over
the
operation
driving
the
darian
operators
away
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
operators
of
a
wore
to
look
like
they
did
have
blue
pigment
in
their
skins
they
did
the
wealdian
tested
the
grid
operation
they
brought
down
another
giant
ship
then
another
and
another
parties
in
the
shiny
spread
through
the
city
there
were
the
huge
stockpiles
of
precious
metals
brought
in
readiness
to
be
surrendered
and
carried
away
some
men
set
to
work
to
load
these
into
the
holds
of
the
ships
of
weald
some
went
forthrightly
after
personal
loot
they
came
upon
very
few
darians
those
they
saw
kept
sullenly
away
from
them
they
entered
shops
and
took
what
they
fancied
they
zestfully
removed
the
treasure
of
banks
triumphant
and
scornful
reports
went
up
to
the
hovering
great
ships
the
blueskins
said
the
reports
were
spiritless
and
cowardly
they
permitted
themselves
to
be
robbed
they
kept
out
of
the
way
it
had
been
observed
that
the
population
was
streaming
out
of
the
city
fleeing
because
they
feared
the
ships
the
blueskins
had
abjectly
produced
all
they
promised
of
precious
metals
but
there
was
more
to
be
taken
more
ships
came
down
and
more
some
of
the
first
heavily
loaded
were
lifted
to
emptiness
again
and
the
process
of
decontamination
of
their
hulls
began
there
was
jealousy
among
the
ships
in
space
for
those
upon
the
ground
the
ships
had
had
their
choice
of
loot
there
were
squabblings
about
priorities
now
that
the
navy
of
weald
plainly
had
a
license
to
steal
there
was
confusion
among
the
members
of
the
discipline
disappeared
men
in
plastic
roved
about
as
individuals
seeking
what
they
might
loot
there
were
armed
and
alerted
around
the
grid
itself
of
course
but
the
capital
city
of
dara
lay
open
men
coming
back
with
loot
found
their
ships
already
lifted
off
to
make
room
for
others
they
were
pushed
into
of
other
ships
there
were
more
and
more
men
to
be
found
on
ships
where
they
did
not
belong
and
more
and
more
not
to
be
found
where
they
did
by
the
time
half
the
fleet
had
been
aground
there
was
no
longer
any
pretense
of
holding
a
ship
down
until
all
its
crew
returned
there
were
too
many
other
ships
companies
clamoring
for
their
turn
to
loot
the
rosters
of
many
ships
indeed
bore
no
particular
relationship
to
the
men
actually
on
board
there
were
less
than
fifteen
ships
whose
holds
were
still
emptied
when
the
watchful
government
of
dara
broadcast
a
new
message
to
the
invaders
it
requested
that
the
looting
stop
no
matter
what
payment
weald
claimed
it
had
taken
payment
five
times
over
now
was
time
to
stop
it
was
amusing
the
space
admiral
of
weald
ordered
his
ships
alerted
for
action
the
message
ship
ordering
the
darian
fleet
away
from
weald
had
been
sent
off
long
since
no
other
ship
could
get
away
now
the
darians
could
take
their
choice
accept
the
consequences
of
surrender
or
the
fleet
would
rise
to
throw
down
bombs
calhoun
was
asking
politely
to
be
taken
to
the
wealdian
admiral
when
the
trouble
began
it
was
on
the
ground
at
all
everything
was
under
splendid
control
where
a
landing
force
occupied
the
grid
and
all
the
ground
immediately
about
it
the
space
admiral
had
headquarters
in
the
office
reports
came
in
orders
were
issued
admirably
crisp
salutes
were
exchanged
among
men
everything
was
in
perfect
shape
there
but
there
was
panic
among
the
ships
in
space
communicators
gave
off
horrified
yells
there
were
screamings
intelligible
communications
ceased
ships
plunged
crazily
this
way
and
that
some
vanished
in
overdrive
at
least
one
plunged
at
full
power
into
a
darian
ocean
the
space
admiral
found
himself
in
command
of
fifteen
ships
only
out
of
all
his
former
force
the
rest
of
the
fleet
went
through
a
period
of
hysterical
madness
in
some
ships
it
lasted
for
minutes
only
in
others
it
went
on
for
half
an
hour
or
more
then
they
hung
overhead
but
did
not
reply
to
calls
calhoun
arrived
at
the
spaceport
with
murgatroyd
riding
on
his
shoulder
a
bewildered
officer
in
a
halted
him
i
come
said
calhoun
to
speak
to
the
admiral
my
name
is
calhoun
and
i
med
service
and
i
think
i
met
the
admiral
at
a
banquet
a
few
weeks
ago
he
remember
me
you
have
to
wait
protested
the
officer
there
some
trouble
yes
said
calhoun
i
know
about
it
i
helped
design
it
i
want
to
explain
it
to
the
admiral
he
needs
to
know
what
happened
if
to
take
appropriate
measures
there
were
jitterings
many
men
in
had
still
no
idea
that
anything
had
gone
wrong
some
appeared
brightly
carrying
loot
some
hung
eagerly
around
the
airlocks
of
ships
on
the
grid
tarmac
waiting
their
turns
to
stand
in
corrosive
gases
for
the
decontamination
of
their
suits
when
they
would
burn
the
outer
layers
and
step
aseptic
and
happy
into
a
wealdian
ship
again
there
they
could
think
how
rich
they
were
going
to
be
back
on
weald
but
the
situation
aloft
was
bewildering
and
very
very
ominous
there
was
strident
argument
presently
calhoun
stood
before
the
wealdian
admiral
i
came
to
explain
something
said
calhoun
pleasantly
the
situation
has
changed
you
noticed
it
i
sure
the
admiral
glared
at
him
through
two
layers
of
plastic
which
covered
him
almost
like
a
parcel
be
quick
he
rasped
first
said
calhoun
there
are
no
more
blueskins
an
epidemic
of
something
or
other
has
made
the
blue
patches
on
the
skins
of
darians
fade
out
there
have
always
been
some
who
did
have
blue
patches
now
nobody
has
them
nonsense
rasped
the
admiral
and
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
this
situation
why
everything
said
calhoun
mildly
it
seems
that
darians
can
pass
for
wealdians
whenever
they
please
that
they
passing
for
wealdians
that
they
been
mixing
with
your
men
wearing
exactly
like
the
one
you
wearing
now
they
been
going
aboard
your
ships
in
the
confusion
of
returning
looters
there
not
a
ship
now
aloft
which
has
been
aground
today
which
has
from
one
to
fifteen
darians
no
longer
blueskins
on
board
the
admiral
roared
then
his
face
turned
gray
you
ca
take
your
fleet
back
to
weald
said
calhoun
gently
if
you
believe
its
crews
have
been
exposed
to
carriers
of
the
dara
plague
you
would
be
allowed
to
land
anyhow
the
admiral
said
through
stiff
lips
i
blast
no
said
calhoun
again
gently
when
you
ordered
all
ships
alerted
for
action
the
darians
on
each
ship
released
panic
gas
they
only
needed
tiny
containers
of
the
gas
for
the
job
they
had
them
they
only
needed
to
use
air
tanks
from
their
to
protect
themselves
against
the
gas
they
kept
them
handy
on
nearly
all
your
ships
aloft
your
crews
are
crazy
from
panic
gas
they
stay
that
way
until
the
air
is
changed
darians
have
barricaded
themselves
in
the
control
rooms
of
most
if
not
all
your
ships
you
have
got
a
fleet
the
few
ships
who
will
obey
your
orders
if
they
drop
one
bomb
our
fleet
off
weald
will
drop
fifty
i
do
think
you
better
order
offensive
action
instead
i
think
you
better
have
your
fleet
medical
officers
come
and
learn
some
of
the
facts
of
life
there
no
need
for
war
between
dara
and
weald
but
if
you
insist
the
admiral
made
a
choking
noise
he
could
have
ordered
calhoun
killed
but
there
was
a
certain
appalling
fact
the
men
aground
from
the
fleet
were
breathing
wealdian
air
from
tanks
it
would
last
so
long
only
if
they
were
taken
on
board
the
still
obedient
ships
overhead
darians
would
unquestionably
be
mixed
with
them
there
was
no
way
to
take
off
the
parties
now
aground
without
exposing
them
to
contact
with
darians
on
the
ground
or
in
the
ships
there
was
no
way
to
sort
out
the
darians
i
i
will
give
the
orders
said
the
admiral
thickly
i
do
not
know
what
you
devils
plan
but
i
do
not
know
how
to
stop
you
all
that
necessary
said
calhoun
warmly
is
an
open
mind
a
misunderstanding
to
be
cleared
up
and
some
principles
of
planetary
health
practises
to
be
explained
and
a
certain
amount
of
prejudice
that
has
to
be
thrown
away
but
nobody
need
die
of
changing
their
minds
the
interstellar
medical
service
has
proved
that
over
and
over
murgatroyd
perched
on
his
shoulder
felt
that
it
was
time
to
take
part
in
the
conversation
he
said
yes
agreed
calhoun
we
do
want
to
get
the
job
done
we
behind
schedule
now
it
was
not
of
course
possible
for
calhoun
to
leave
immediately
he
had
to
preside
at
various
meetings
of
the
medical
officers
of
the
fleet
and
the
health
officials
of
dara
he
had
to
make
explanations
and
correct
misapprehensions
and
delicately
suggest
such
biological
experiments
as
would
prove
to
the
doctors
of
weald
that
there
was
no
longer
a
plague
on
dara
whatever
had
been
the
case
three
generations
before
he
had
to
sit
by
while
an
extremely
young
darian
doctor
one
of
his
names
was
korvan
rather
condescendingly
demonstrated
that
the
former
blue
pigmentation
was
a
viral
product
quite
unconnected
with
the
plague
and
that
it
had
been
wiped
out
by
a
very
trivial
epidemic
of
such
and
such
calhoun
regarded
that
young
man
with
a
detached
interest
maril
thought
him
wonderful
even
if
she
had
to
give
him
the
material
for
his
work
he
agreed
with
her
that
he
was
wonderful
calhoun
shrugged
and
went
on
with
his
own
work
the
return
of
loot
mutual
full
and
complete
agreement
that
darians
were
no
longer
carriers
of
plague
if
they
had
ever
been
unless
weald
convinced
other
worlds
of
this
weald
itself
would
join
dara
in
isolation
from
neighboring
worlds
a
messenger
ship
had
to
recall
the
ships
once
floating
in
orbit
about
weald
most
of
them
would
be
used
for
some
time
to
bring
beef
from
orede
some
would
haul
more
grain
from
weald
it
would
be
paid
for
there
would
be
a
need
for
commercial
missions
to
be
exchanged
between
weald
and
dara
there
would
have
to
be
it
was
a
full
week
before
he
could
go
to
the
little
med
ship
and
prepare
for
departure
even
then
there
were
matters
to
be
attended
to
all
the
that
had
been
removed
could
not
be
replaced
there
were
biological
samples
to
be
replaced
and
some
to
be
destroyed
maril
came
to
the
med
ship
again
when
he
was
almost
ready
to
leave
she
did
not
seem
comfortable
i
wanted
you
to
meet
korvan
she
said
regretfully
i
met
him
said
calhoun
i
think
he
will
be
a
most
prominent
citizen
in
time
he
has
all
the
talents
for
it
maril
smiled
very
faintly
but
you
do
admire
him
i
would
say
that
protested
calhoun
after
all
he
is
desirable
to
you
which
is
something
i
could
manage
you
did
try
said
maril
just
as
i
did
try
to
be
fascinating
to
you
why
calhoun
spread
out
his
hands
but
he
looked
at
maril
with
respect
not
every
woman
could
have
faced
the
fact
that
a
man
did
not
feel
impelled
to
make
passes
at
her
it
is
simply
a
fact
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
desirability
or
charm
or
anything
else
you
going
to
marry
him
he
said
i
hope
you
be
very
happy
he
the
man
i
want
said
maril
frankly
and
i
doubt
he
ever
look
at
another
woman
he
looks
forward
to
splendid
discoveries
i
wish
he
did
calhoun
did
not
ask
the
obvious
question
instead
he
said
thoughtfully
there
something
you
could
do
it
needs
to
be
done
the
med
service
in
this
sector
has
been
badly
handled
there
are
a
number
of
discoveries
that
need
to
be
made
i
do
think
your
korvan
would
relish
having
things
handed
to
him
on
a
visible
silver
platter
but
they
should
be
known
maril
said
i
can
guess
what
you
mean
i
dropped
hints
about
the
way
the
blueskin
markings
went
away
yes
you
got
books
for
me
calhoun
nodded
he
found
them
if
we
had
only
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
maril
we
be
a
team
too
bad
these
are
a
wedding
present
you
do
well
to
hide
she
put
her
hands
in
his
i
like
you
almost
as
much
as
i
like
murgatroyd
yes
korvan
will
never
know
and
he
be
a
great
man
then
she
added
defensively
but
i
do
think
he
only
discover
things
from
hints
i
drop
him
he
make
wonderful
discoveries
of
which
said
calhoun
the
most
remarkable
is
you
good
luck
maril
she
went
away
smiling
but
she
wiped
her
eyes
when
she
was
out
of
the
ship
presently
the
med
ship
lifted
calhoun
aimed
it
for
the
next
planet
on
the
list
of
those
he
was
to
visit
after
this
one
more
he
return
to
sector
headquarters
with
a
biting
report
to
make
on
the
way
things
had
been
handled
before
him
overdrive
coming
murgatroyd
then
the
stars
went
out
and
there
was
silence
and
privacy
and
a
faint
faint
almost
unbearable
series
of
background
sounds
which
kept
the
med
ship
from
being
totally
unendurable
long
long
days
later
the
ship
broke
out
of
overdrive
and
calhoun
guided
it
to
a
round
and
sunlit
world
in
due
time
he
thumbed
the
communicator
button
calling
ground
he
said
crisply
calling
ground
med
ship
reporting
arrival
and
asking
coordinates
for
landing
purpose
of
landing
is
planetary
health
inspection
our
mass
is
fifty
standard
tons
there
was
a
pause
while
the
beamed
message
went
many
many
thousands
of
miles
then
the
speaker
said
repeat
your
identification
calhoun
repeated
it
patiently
murgatroyd
watched
with
bright
eyes
perhaps
he
hoped
to
be
allowed
to
have
another
long
conversation
with
somebody
by
communicator
you
are
warned
said
the
communicator
sternly
that
any
deceit
or
deception
about
your
identity
or
purpose
in
landing
will
be
severely
punished
we
take
few
chances
here
if
you
wish
to
land
notwithstanding
this
warning
i
coming
in
said
calhoun
give
me
the
coordinates
he
wrote
them
down
his
expression
was
slightly
pained
the
med
ship
drove
on

murgatroyd
said
chee
calhoun
sighed
that
right
murgatroyd
here
we
go

the

the
interstellar
medical
service
was
just
about
the
only
remaining
galactic
organization
that
every
one
of
the
hundreds
of
inhabited
planets
respected
so
when
their
service
broke
down
in
star
sector
twelve
it
created
a
very
dangerous
situation
when
calhoun
took
his
med
ship
out
of
overdrive
near
that
planet
weald
he
was
vaguely
aware
of
the
risks
but
the
crisis
came
home
to
him
with
a
crash
the
moment
he
radioed
in

were
the
