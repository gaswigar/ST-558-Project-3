the
masquerader
by
katherine
cecil
thurston
i
two
incidents
widely
different
in
character
yet
bound
together
by
results
marked
the
night
of
january
the
on
that
night
the
blackest
fog
within
a
four
years
memory
fell
upon
certain
portions
of
london
and
also
on
that
night
came
the
first
announcement
of
the
border
risings
against
the
persian
government
in
the
province
of
khorasan
the
announcement
that
speculated
upon
even
smiled
at
at
the
time
assumed
such
significance
in
the
light
of
after
events
at
eight
the
news
spread
through
the
house
of
commons
but
at
nine
men
in
the
inner
lobbies
were
gossiping
not
so
much
upon
how
far
russia
while
ostensibly
upholding
the
shah
had
pulled
the
strings
by
which
the
insurgents
danced
as
upon
the
manner
in
which
the
george
gazette
the
tory
evening
newspaper
had
seized
upon
the
incident
and
shaken
it
in
the
faces
of
the
government
more
than
once
before
lakely
the
owner
and
editor
of
the
had
stepped
outside
the
decorous
circle
of
tradition
and
taken
a
plunge
into
modern
journalism
but
he
essayed
deeper
waters
than
before
and
under
an
almost
sensational
heading
declared
that
in
this
apparently
innocent
border
rising
we
had
less
an
outcome
of
mere
racial
antagonism
than
a
first
faint
index
of
a
russian
scheme
growing
to
a
gradual
maturity
under
the
drift
policy
of
the
present
british
government
the
effect
produced
by
this
pronouncement
if
strong
was
varied
members
of
the
opposition
saw
or
thought
they
saw
a
reflection
of
it
in
the
smiling
unconcern
on
the
ministerial
benches
and
the
government
had
an
uneasy
sense
that
behind
the
newly
kindled
interest
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
lay
some
mysterious
scenting
of
battle
from
afar
off
but
though
these
impressions
ran
like
electricity
through
the
atmosphere
nothing
tangible
marked
their
passage
and
the
ordinary
business
of
the
house
proceeded
until
eleven
when
an
adjournment
was
moved
the
first
man
to
hurry
from
his
place
was
john
chilcote
member
for
east
wark
he
passed
out
of
the
house
quickly
with
the
quickness
that
marks
a
man
and
as
he
passed
the
policeman
standing
stolidly
under
the
arched
of
the
big
he
swerved
a
little
as
if
startled
out
of
his
thoughts
he
realized
his
swerve
almost
before
it
was
accomplished
and
pulled
himself
together
with
nervous
irritability
foggy
night
constables
he
said
with
elaborate
carelessness
foggy
night
sir
and
thickening
up
west
responded
the
man
ah
indeed
chilcote
answer
was
absent
the
constable
cheery
voice
jarred
on
him
and
for
the
second
time
he
was
conscious
of
senseless
irritation
without
a
further
glance
at
the
man
he
slipped
out
into
the
and
turned
towards
the
main
gate
at
the
two
cab
lamps
showed
through
the
mist
of
shifting
fog
like
the
eyes
of
a
great
cat
and
the
familiar
hansom
sir
came
to
him
indistinctly
he
paused
by
force
of
custom
and
stepping
forward
had
almost
touched
the
open
door
when
a
new
impulse
caused
him
to
draw
back
no
he
said
hurriedly
no
i
the
cabman
muttered
lashed
his
horse
and
with
a
clatter
of
hoofs
and
harness
wheeled
away
while
chilcote
still
with
uncertain
hastiness
crossed
the
road
in
the
direction
of
whitehall
about
the
abbey
the
fog
had
partially
lifted
and
in
the
railed
garden
that
faces
the
houses
of
parliament
the
statues
were
visible
in
a
spectral
way
but
chilcote
glance
was
unstable
and
indifferent
he
skirted
the
railings
heedlessly
and
crossing
the
road
with
the
speed
of
long
familiarity
gained
whitehall
on
the
lefthand
side
there
the
fog
had
dropped
and
looking
upward
towards
trafalgar
square
it
seemed
that
the
chain
of
lamps
extended
little
farther
than
the
horse
guards
and
that
beyond
lay
nothing
unconscious
of
this
capricious
alternation
between
darkness
and
light
chilcote
continued
his
course
to
a
close
observer
the
manner
of
his
going
had
both
interest
and
suggestion
for
though
he
walked
on
apparently
yet
at
every
dozen
steps
he
started
at
some
sound
or
some
touch
like
a
man
whose
nervous
system
is
painfully
overstrung
maintaining
his
haste
he
went
deliberately
forward
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
at
each
step
the
curtain
of
darkness
about
him
became
closer
damper
more
tangible
that
at
each
second
the
jostled
each
other
with
greater
frequency
then
abruptly
with
a
sudden
realization
of
what
had
happened
he
stood
quite
still
without
anticipation
or
preparation
he
had
walked
full
into
the
thickness
of
the
fog
a
thickness
so
dense
that
as
by
an
enchanter
wand
the
figures
of
a
moment
before
melted
the
street
lamps
were
sucked
up
into
the
night
his
first
feeling
was
a
sense
of
panic
at
the
sudden
isolation
his
second
a
thrill
of
nervous
apprehension
at
the
oblivion
that
had
allowed
him
to
be
so
entrapped
the
second
feeling
outweighed
the
first
he
moved
forward
then
paused
again
uncertain
of
himself
finally
with
the
consciousness
that
inaction
was
unbearable
he
moved
on
once
more
his
eyes
wide
open
one
hand
thrust
out
as
a
protection
and
guide
the
fog
had
closed
in
behind
him
as
heavily
as
in
front
shutting
off
all
possibility
of
retreat
all
about
him
in
the
darkness
was
a
confusion
of
voices
cheerful
dubious
alarmed
or
angry
now
and
then
a
sleeve
brushed
his
or
a
hand
touched
him
tentatively
it
was
a
strange
moment
a
moment
of
possibilities
to
which
the
crunching
wheels
the
oaths
and
laughter
from
the
blocked
traffic
of
the
made
a
continuous
accompaniment
keeping
well
to
the
left
chilcote
still
beat
on
there
was
a
persistence
in
his
movements
that
almost
amounted
to
fear
a
fear
born
of
the
solitude
filled
with
innumerable
sounds
for
a
space
he
groped
about
him
without
result
then
his
fingers
touched
the
cold
surface
of
a
shuttered
and
a
thrill
of
reassurance
passed
through
him
with
renewed
haste
and
clinging
to
his
landmark
as
a
blind
man
might
he
started
forward
with
fresh
impetus
for
a
dozen
paces
he
moved
rapidly
and
unevenly
then
the
natural
result
occurred
he
collided
with
a
man
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
the
shock
was
abrupt
both
men
swore
simultaneously
then
both
laughed
the
whole
thing
was
casual
but
chilcote
was
in
that
state
of
mind
when
even
the
commonplace
becomes
abnormal
the
other
man
exclamation
the
other
man
laugh
struck
on
his
nerves
coming
out
of
the
darkness
they
sounded
like
a
repetition
of
his
own
nine
out
of
every
ten
men
in
london
given
the
same
social
position
and
the
same
education
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
express
annoyance
or
amusement
in
the
same
manner
possibly
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
and
chilcote
remembered
this
almost
at
the
moment
of
his
nervous
jar
beastly
fog
he
said
aloud
i
trying
to
find
grosvenor
square
but
the
chances
seem
rather
the
other
laughed
again
and
again
the
laugh
upset
chilcote
he
wondered
uncomfortably
if
he
was
becoming
a
prey
to
illusions
but
the
stranger
spoke
before
the
question
had
solved
itself
i
afraid
they
are
small
he
said
it
would
be
almost
hard
to
find
one
way
to
the
devil
on
a
night
like
chilcote
made
a
murmur
of
amusement
and
drew
back
against
the
shop
yes
we
can
see
now
where
the
blind
man
scores
in
the
matter
of
salvation
this
is
almost
a
repetition
of
the
fog
of
six
years
ago
were
you
out
in
that
it
was
a
habit
of
his
to
jump
from
one
sentence
to
another
a
habit
that
had
grown
of
late
the
stranger
had
also
groped
his
way
to
the
shopfront
no
i
was
out
of
england
six
years
you
were
chilcote
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
coat
it
was
an
atrocious
fog
as
black
as
this
but
more
universal
i
remember
it
well
it
was
the
night
lexington
made
his
great
sugar
speech
some
of
us
were
found
on
lambeth
bridge
at
three
in
the
morning
having
left
the
house
at
chilcote
seldom
indulged
in
reminiscences
but
this
conversation
with
an
unseen
companion
was
more
like
a
soliloquy
than
a
dialogue
he
was
almost
surprised
into
an
exclamation
when
the
other
caught
up
his
words
ah
the
sugar
speech
he
said
odd
that
i
should
have
been
looking
it
up
only
yesterday
what
a
magnificent
of
a
dry
subject
it
was
what
a
career
lexington
promised
in
those
days
chilcote
changed
his
position
you
are
interested
in
the
muddle
down
at
westminster
he
asked
sarcastically
i
it
was
the
turn
of
the
stranger
to
draw
back
a
step
oh
i
read
my
newspaper
with
the
other
five
million
that
is
all
i
am
an
his
voice
sounded
curt
the
warmth
that
admiration
had
brought
into
it
a
moment
before
had
frozen
abruptly
an
outsider
chilcote
repeated
what
an
enviable
word
possibly
to
those
who
are
well
inside
the
ring
but
let
us
go
back
to
lexington
what
a
pinnacle
the
man
reached
and
what
a
drop
he
had
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
an
extraordinary
instance
of
the
human
leaven
running
through
us
all
what
was
the
real
cause
of
his
collapse
he
asked
suddenly
was
it
drugs
or
drink
i
have
often
wished
to
get
at
the
again
chilcote
changed
his
attitude
is
truth
ever
worth
getting
at
he
asked
irrelevantly
in
the
case
of
a
public
man
yes
he
exchanges
his
privacy
for
the
interest
of
the
masses
if
he
gives
the
masses
the
details
of
his
success
why
not
the
details
of
his
failure
but
was
it
drink
that
sucked
him
under
chilcote
response
came
after
a
pause
drugs
again
chilcote
hesitated
and
at
the
moment
of
his
indecision
a
woman
brushed
past
him
laughing
boisterously
the
sound
jarred
him
was
it
drugs
the
stranger
went
on
easily
i
have
always
had
a
theory
that
it
yes
it
was
the
answer
came
before
chilcote
had
realized
it
the
woman
laugh
at
the
stranger
quiet
persistence
had
contrived
to
draw
it
from
him
instantly
he
had
spoken
he
looked
about
him
quickly
like
one
who
has
for
a
moment
forgotten
a
necessary
vigilance
there
was
silence
while
the
stranger
thought
over
the
information
just
given
him
then
he
spoke
again
with
a
new
touch
of
vehemence
so
i
imagined
he
said
though
on
my
soul
i
never
really
credited
it
to
have
gained
so
much
and
to
have
thrown
it
away
for
a
common
vice
he
made
an
exclamation
of
disgust
chilcote
gave
an
unsteady
laugh
you
judge
he
said
the
other
repeated
his
sound
of
contempt
justly
so
no
man
has
the
right
to
squander
what
another
would
give
his
soul
for
it
lessens
the
general
respect
for
you
are
a
believer
in
power
the
tone
was
sarcastic
but
the
sarcasm
sounded
thin
yes
all
power
is
the
outcome
of
individuality
either
past
or
present
i
find
no
sentiment
for
the
man
who
plays
with
the
quiet
contempt
of
the
tone
stung
chilcote
do
you
imagine
that
lexington
made
no
fight
he
asked
impulsively
ca
you
picture
the
man
struggle
while
the
vice
that
had
been
slave
gradually
became
master
he
stopped
to
take
breath
and
in
the
cold
pause
that
followed
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
other
made
a
murmur
of
incredulity
perhaps
you
think
of
morphia
as
a
pleasure
he
added
think
of
it
instead
as
a
tyrant
that
tortures
the
mind
if
held
to
and
the
body
if
cast
urged
by
the
darkness
and
the
silence
of
his
companion
the
rein
of
his
speech
had
loosened
in
that
moment
he
was
not
chilcote
the
member
for
east
wark
whose
moods
and
silences
were
proverbial
but
chilcote
the
man
whose
mind
craved
the
relief
of
speech
you
talk
as
the
world
talks
out
of
ignorance
and
he
went
on
before
you
condemn
lexington
you
should
put
yourself
in
his
place
as
you
do
the
other
laughed
unsuspecting
and
inoffensive
as
the
laugh
was
it
startled
chilcote
with
a
sudden
alarm
he
pulled
himself
up
i
he
tried
to
echo
the
laugh
but
the
attempt
fell
flat
oh
i
merely
speak
from
from
de
quincey
but
i
believe
this
fog
is
shifting
i
really
believe
it
is
shifting
can
you
oblige
me
with
a
light
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
a
man
may
still
smoke
though
he
has
been
deprived
of
he
spoke
fast
and
disjointedly
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
idea
that
he
had
let
himself
go
and
possessed
by
the
wish
to
obliterate
the
consequences
as
he
talked
he
fumbled
for
his
his
bead
was
bent
as
he
searched
for
it
nervously
without
looking
up
he
was
conscious
that
the
cloud
of
fog
that
held
him
prisoner
was
lifting
rolling
away
closing
back
again
preparatory
to
final
disappearance
having
found
the
case
he
put
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
and
raised
his
hand
at
the
moment
that
the
stranger
drew
a
match
across
his
box
for
a
second
each
stared
blankly
at
the
other
face
suddenly
made
visible
by
the
lifting
of
the
fog
the
match
in
the
stranger
hand
burned
down
till
it
scorched
his
fingers
and
feeling
the
pain
he
laughed
and
let
it
drop
of
all
odd
things
he
said
then
he
broke
off
the
circumstance
was
too
novel
for
ordinary
remark
by
one
of
those
rare
occurrences
those
chances
that
seem
too
wild
for
real
life
and
yet
belong
to
no
other
sphere
the
two
faces
so
strangely
hidden
and
strangely
revealed
were
identical
feature
for
feature
it
seemed
to
each
man
that
he
looked
not
at
the
face
of
another
but
at
his
own
face
reflected
in
a
flawless
of
the
two
the
stranger
was
the
first
to
regain
seeing
chilcote
bewilderment
he
came
to
his
rescue
with
brusque
tactfulness
the
position
is
decidedly
odd
he
said
but
after
all
why
should
we
be
so
surprised
nature
ca
be
eternally
original
she
must
dry
up
sometimes
and
when
she
gets
a
good
model
why
should
she
use
it
twice
he
drew
back
surveying
chilcote
whimsically
but
pardon
me
you
are
still
waiting
for
that
light
chilcote
still
held
the
cigarette
between
his
lips
the
paper
had
become
dry
and
he
moistened
it
as
he
leaned
towards
his
companion
do
mind
me
he
said
i
rather
rather
unstrung
and
this
thing
gave
me
a
jar
to
be
candid
my
imagination
took
head
in
the
fog
and
i
got
to
fancy
i
was
talking
to
myself
and
pulled
up
to
find
the
fancy
in
some
way
real
yes
something
like
both
were
silent
for
a
moment
chilcote
pulled
hard
at
his
cigarette
then
remembering
his
obligations
he
turned
quickly
to
the
other
wo
you
smoke
he
asked
the
stranger
accepted
a
cigarette
from
the
case
held
out
to
him
and
as
he
did
so
the
extraordinary
likeness
to
himself
struck
chilcote
with
added
force
involuntarily
he
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
the
arm
it
my
nerves
he
said
in
explanation
they
make
me
want
to
feel
that
you
are
substantial
nerves
play
such
beastly
tricks
he
laughed
awkwardly
the
other
glanced
up
his
expression
on
the
moment
was
slightly
surprised
slightly
contemptuous
but
he
changed
it
instantly
to
conventional
interest
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
an
authority
on
nerves
he
said
but
chilcote
was
preoccupied
his
thoughts
had
turned
into
another
channel
how
old
are
you
he
asked
suddenly
the
other
did
not
answer
immediately
my
age
he
said
at
last
slowly
oh
i
believe
i
shall
be
to
be
quite
chilcote
lifted
his
head
quickly
why
do
you
use
that
tone
he
asked
i
am
six
months
older
than
you
and
i
only
wish
it
was
six
years
six
years
nearer
oblivion
again
a
slight
incredulous
contempt
crossed
the
other
eyes
oblivion
he
said
where
are
your
ambitions
they
do
do
exist
yet
you
voice
your
country
i
concluded
that
much
in
the
chilcote
laughed
sarcastically
when
one
has
voiced
one
country
for
six
years
one
gets
hoarse
it
a
natural
the
other
smiled
ah
discontent
he
said
the
modern
canker
but
we
must
both
be
getting
under
way
shall
we
shake
hands
to
prove
that
we
are
genuinely
material
chilcote
had
been
standing
unusually
still
following
the
words
caught
by
his
and
impressed
by
his
personality
now
as
he
ceased
to
speak
he
moved
quickly
forward
impelled
by
a
nervous
curiosity
why
should
we
just
hail
each
other
and
pass
like
the
proverbial
ships
he
said
impulsively
if
nature
was
careless
enough
to
let
the
reproduction
meet
the
original
she
must
abide
the
the
other
laughed
but
his
laugh
was
short
oh
i
do
know
our
roads
lie
differently
you
would
get
nothing
out
of
me
and
i
he
stopped
and
again
laughed
shortly
no
he
said
i
be
content
to
pass
if
i
were
you
the
unsuccessful
man
is
seldom
a
profitable
study
shall
we
say
he
took
chilcote
hand
for
an
instant
then
crossing
the
footpath
he
passed
into
the
towards
the
strand
it
was
done
in
a
moment
but
with
his
going
a
sense
of
loss
fell
upon
chilcote
he
stood
for
a
space
newly
conscious
of
unfamiliar
faces
and
unfamiliar
voices
in
the
stream
of
passersby
then
suddenly
mastered
by
an
impulse
he
wheeled
rapidly
and
darted
after
the
tall
lean
figure
so
ridiculously
like
his
own
across
trafalgar
square
he
overtook
the
stranger
he
had
paused
on
one
of
the
small
stone
islands
that
break
the
current
of
traffic
and
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
cross
the
street
in
the
glare
of
light
from
the
lamp
above
his
head
chilcote
saw
for
the
first
time
that
under
a
remarkable
neatness
of
appearance
his
clothes
were
well
worn
almost
shabby
the
discovery
struck
him
with
something
stronger
than
surprise
the
idea
of
poverty
seemed
incongruous
is
connection
with
the
reliance
the
reserve
the
personality
of
the
man
with
a
certain
embarrassed
haste
he
stepped
forward
and
touched
his
arm
look
here
he
said
as
the
other
turned
quietly
i
have
followed
you
to
exchange
cards
it
ca
injure
either
of
us
and
i
i
have
a
wish
to
know
my
other
he
laughed
nervously
as
he
drew
out
his
the
stranger
watched
him
in
silence
there
was
the
same
faint
contempt
but
also
there
was
a
reluctant
interest
in
his
glance
as
it
passed
from
the
fingers
fumbling
with
the
case
to
the
pale
face
with
the
square
jaw
straight
mouth
and
level
eyebrows
drawn
low
over
the
gray
eyes
when
at
last
the
card
was
held
out
to
him
he
took
it
without
remark
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
chilcote
looked
at
him
eagerly
now
the
exchange
he
said
for
a
second
the
stranger
did
not
respond
then
almost
unexpectedly
he
smiled
after
all
if
it
amuses
you
he
said
and
searching
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
drew
out
the
required
card
it
will
leave
you
quite
unenlightened
he
added
the
name
of
a
failure
never
spells
with
another
smile
partly
amused
partly
ironical
he
stepped
from
the
little
island
and
disappeared
into
the
throng
of
traffic
chilcote
stood
for
an
instant
gazing
at
the
point
where
he
had
vanished
then
turning
to
the
lamp
he
lifted
the
card
and
read
the
name
it
bore
mr
john
loder
clifford
ii
on
the
morning
following
the
night
of
fog
chilcote
woke
at
nine
he
woke
at
the
moment
that
his
man
allsopp
tiptoed
across
the
room
and
laid
the
salver
with
his
early
cup
of
tea
on
the
table
beside
the
bed
for
several
seconds
he
lay
with
his
eyes
shut
the
effort
of
opening
them
on
a
fresh
day
the
intimate
certainty
of
what
he
would
see
on
opening
them
seemed
to
weight
his
lids
the
heavy
curtains
the
blinds
severely
drawn
the
great
room
with
its
splendid
furniture
its
sober
coloring
its
scent
of
damp
london
winter
above
all
allsopp
silent
respectful
and
respectable
were
things
to
dread
a
full
minute
passed
while
he
still
feigned
sleep
he
heard
allsopp
stir
discreetly
then
the
inevitable
information
broke
the
silence
nine
sir
he
opened
his
eyes
murmured
something
and
closed
them
again
the
man
moved
to
the
window
quietly
pulled
back
the
curtains
and
half
drew
the
blind
better
night
sir
i
hope
he
ventured
softly
chilcote
had
drawn
the
bedclothes
over
his
face
to
screen
himself
from
the
daylight
murky
though
it
was
yes
he
responded
those
beastly
nightmares
did
trouble
me
for
he
shivered
a
little
as
at
some
recollection
but
talk
do
remind
me
of
them
i
hate
a
man
who
has
no
he
spoke
sharply
at
times
he
showed
an
almost
childish
irritation
over
trivial
things
allsopp
took
the
remark
in
silence
crossing
the
wide
room
he
began
to
lay
out
his
master
clothes
the
action
affected
chilcote
to
fresh
annoyance
confound
it
he
said
i
sick
of
that
routine
i
can
see
you
laying
out
my
the
day
of
my
burial
leave
those
things
come
back
in
half
an
allsopp
allowed
himself
one
glance
at
his
master
figure
huddled
in
the
great
bed
then
laying
aside
the
coat
he
was
holding
he
moved
to
the
door
with
his
fingers
on
the
handle
he
paused
will
you
breakfast
in
your
own
room
sir
or
chilcote
drew
the
clothes
more
tightly
round
his
shoulders
oh
anywhere
nowhere
he
said
i
do
allsopp
softly
withdrew
left
to
himself
chilcote
sat
up
in
bed
and
lifted
the
salver
to
his
knees
the
sudden
movement
jarred
him
physically
he
drew
a
handkerchief
from
under
the
pillow
and
wiped
his
forehead
then
he
held
his
hand
to
the
light
and
studied
it
the
hand
looked
sallow
and
unsteady
with
a
nervous
gesture
he
thrust
the
salver
back
upon
the
table
and
slid
out
of
bed
moving
hastily
across
the
room
he
stopped
before
one
of
the
tall
wardrobes
and
swung
the
door
open
then
after
a
furtive
glance
around
the
room
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
recesses
of
a
shelf
and
fumbled
there
the
thing
he
sought
was
evidently
not
hard
to
find
for
almost
at
once
he
withdrew
his
hand
and
moved
from
the
wardrobe
to
a
table
beside
the
fireplace
carrying
a
small
glass
tube
filled
with
tabloids
on
the
table
were
a
decanter
a
siphon
and
a
mixing
some
whiskey
he
uncorked
the
tube
again
he
glanced
apprehensively
towards
the
door
then
with
a
very
nervous
hand
dropped
two
tabloids
into
the
glass
while
they
dissolved
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
table
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
evidently
restraining
his
impatience
instantly
they
had
disappeared
he
seized
the
glass
and
drained
it
at
a
draught
replaced
the
bottle
in
the
wardrobe
and
shivering
slightly
in
the
raw
air
slipped
back
into
bed
when
allsopp
returned
he
was
sitting
up
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
the
teacup
standing
empty
on
the
salver
the
nervous
irritability
had
gone
from
his
manner
he
no
longer
moved
jerkily
his
eyes
looked
brighter
his
pale
skin
more
healthy
ah
allsopp
he
said
there
are
some
moments
in
life
after
all
it
is
all
blank
i
ordered
breakfast
in
the
small
sir
said
allsopp
without
a
change
of
expression
chilcote
breakfasted
at
ten
his
appetite
always
fickle
was
particularly
uncertain
in
the
early
hours
he
helped
himself
to
some
fish
but
sent
away
his
plate
untouched
then
having
drunk
two
cups
of
tea
he
pushed
back
his
chair
lighted
a
fresh
cigarette
and
shook
out
the
morning
newspaper
twice
he
shook
it
out
and
twice
turned
it
but
the
reluctance
to
fix
his
mind
upon
it
made
him
dally
the
effect
of
the
morphia
tabloids
was
still
apparent
in
the
greater
steadiness
of
his
hand
and
eye
the
regained
quiet
of
his
susceptibilities
but
the
respite
was
temporary
and
lethargic
the
early
days
the
days
of
six
years
ago
when
these
tabloids
meant
an
even
sweep
of
thought
lucidity
of
brain
a
balance
of
judgment
in
thought
and
effort
were
days
of
the
past
as
he
had
said
of
lexington
and
his
vice
the
slave
had
become
master
as
he
folded
the
paper
in
a
last
attempt
at
interest
the
door
opened
and
his
secretary
came
a
step
or
two
into
the
room
sir
he
said
forgive
me
for
being
so
he
was
a
boy
of
his
breezy
alertness
his
deference
as
to
a
man
who
had
attained
what
he
aspired
to
amused
and
depressed
chilcote
by
turns
blessington
what
is
it
now
he
sighed
through
habit
and
putting
up
his
hand
warded
off
a
ray
of
sun
that
had
forced
itself
through
the
misty
atmosphere
as
if
by
mistake
the
boy
smiled
it
that
business
of
the
wark
timber
contract
sir
he
said
you
promised
you
look
into
it
you
know
shelved
it
for
a
week
already
and
craig
burnage
are
rather
clamoring
for
an
he
moved
forward
and
laid
the
papers
he
was
carrying
on
the
table
beside
chilcote
i
sorry
to
be
such
a
nuisance
he
added
i
hope
your
nerves
are
worrying
you
chilcote
was
toying
with
the
papers
at
the
word
nerves
he
glanced
up
suspiciously
but
blessington
ingenuous
face
satisfied
him
no
he
said
i
settled
my
nerves
last
night
with
with
a
bromide
i
knew
that
fog
would
upset
me
unless
i
took
i
glad
of
that
sir
though
i
avoid
bromides
bad
habit
to
set
up
but
this
wark
business
i
like
to
get
it
under
way
if
you
have
no
chilcote
passed
his
fingers
over
the
papers
were
you
out
in
that
fog
last
night
blessington
no
sir
i
supped
with
some
people
at
the
savoy
and
we
just
missed
it
it
was
very
partial
i
so
i
blessington
put
his
hand
to
his
neat
tie
and
pulled
it
he
was
extremely
polite
but
he
had
an
inordinate
sense
of
duty
forgive
me
sir
he
said
but
about
that
contract
i
know
i
a
frightful
oh
the
contract
chilcote
looked
about
him
absently
did
you
see
anything
of
my
wife
yesterday
what
did
she
do
last
night
mrs
chilcote
gave
me
tea
yesterday
afternoon
she
told
me
she
was
dining
at
lady
sabinet
and
looking
in
at
one
or
two
places
he
eyed
his
papers
in
chilcote
listless
hand
chilcote
smiled
satirically
eve
is
very
true
to
society
he
said
i
could
dine
at
the
sabinets
if
it
was
to
make
me
premier
they
have
a
butler
who
is
an
institution
a
sort
of
heirloom
in
the
family
he
is
fat
and
breathes
audibly
last
time
i
lunched
there
he
haunted
me
for
a
whole
blessington
laughed
gayly
mrs
chilcote
does
see
ghosts
sir
he
said
but
if
i
may
suggest
chilcote
tapped
his
fingers
on
the
table
no
eve
does
see
ghosts
we
rather
miss
sympathy
blessington
governed
his
impatience
he
stood
still
for
some
seconds
then
glanced
down
at
his
pointed
boot
if
you
will
be
lenient
to
my
persistency
sir
i
would
like
to
remind
you
chilcote
lifted
his
head
with
a
flash
of
irritability
confound
it
blessington
he
exclaimed
am
i
never
to
be
left
in
peace
am
i
never
to
sit
down
to
a
meal
without
having
work
thrust
upon
me
work
work
perpetually
work
i
have
heard
no
other
word
in
the
last
six
years
i
declare
there
are
times
he
rose
suddenly
from
his
seat
and
turned
to
the
window
there
are
times
when
i
feel
that
for
sixpence
i
chuck
it
all
the
whole
beastly
round
startled
by
his
vehemence
blessington
wheeled
towards
him
not
your
political
career
sir
there
was
a
moment
in
which
chilcote
hesitated
a
moment
in
which
the
desire
that
had
filled
his
mind
for
months
rose
to
his
lips
and
hung
there
then
the
question
the
incredulity
in
blessington
face
chilled
it
and
it
fell
back
into
silence
i
i
did
say
that
he
murmured
you
young
men
jump
to
conclusions
forgive
me
sir
i
never
meant
to
imply
retirement
why
rickshaw
vale
cressham
and
the
whole
wark
crowd
would
be
about
your
ears
like
flies
if
such
a
thing
were
even
breathed
now
more
than
ever
since
these
persian
rumors
is
there
anything
real
in
this
border
business
the
george
came
out
rather
strong
last
chilcote
had
moved
back
to
the
table
his
face
was
pale
from
his
outburst
and
his
fingers
toyed
restlessly
with
the
open
newspaper
i
have
seen
the
george
he
said
hastily
lakely
is
always
ready
to
shake
the
red
rag
where
russia
is
concerned
whether
we
are
to
enter
the
arena
is
another
matter
but
what
about
craig
burnage
i
think
you
mentioned
something
of
a
oh
do
worry
about
that
blessington
had
caught
the
twitching
at
the
corners
of
chilcote
mouth
the
nervous
sharpness
of
his
voice
i
can
put
craig
burnage
off
if
they
have
an
answer
by
thursday
it
will
be
time
he
began
to
collect
his
papers
but
chilcote
stopped
him
wait
he
said
veering
suddenly
wait
i
see
to
it
now
i
feel
more
myself
when
i
done
something
i
come
with
you
to
the
he
walked
hastily
across
the
room
then
with
his
hand
on
the
door
he
paused
you
go
first
blessington
he
said
i
i
follow
you
in
ten
minutes
i
must
glance
through
the
newspapers
blessington
looked
uncertain
you
wo
forget
sir
forget
of
course
still
doubtfully
blessington
left
the
room
and
closed
the
door
once
alone
chilcote
walked
slowly
back
to
the
table
drew
up
his
chair
and
sat
down
with
his
eyes
on
the
white
cloth
the
paper
lying
unheeded
beside
him
time
passed
a
servant
came
into
the
room
to
remove
the
breakfast
chilcote
moved
slightly
when
necessary
but
otherwise
retained
his
attitude
the
servant
having
finished
his
task
replenished
the
fire
and
left
the
room
chilcote
still
sat
on
at
last
feeling
numbed
he
rose
and
crossed
to
the
fireplace
the
clock
on
the
stared
him
in
the
face
he
looked
at
it
started
slightly
then
drew
out
his
watch
watch
and
clock
corresponded
each
marked
twelve
with
a
nervous
motion
he
leaned
forward
and
pressed
the
electric
bell
long
and
hard
instantly
a
servant
answered
is
blessington
in
the
study
chilcote
asked
he
was
there
sir
five
minutes
chilcote
looked
relieved
all
right
tell
him
i
have
gone
out
had
to
go
out
something
important
you
understand
i
understand
but
before
the
words
had
been
properly
spoken
chilcote
had
passed
the
man
and
walked
into
the
hall
iii
leaving
his
house
chilcote
walked
forward
quickly
and
aimlessly
with
the
sting
of
the
outer
air
the
recollection
of
last
night
adventure
came
back
upon
him
since
the
hour
of
his
waking
it
had
hung
about
with
vague
persistence
but
now
in
the
clear
light
of
day
it
seemed
to
stand
out
with
a
fuller
peculiarity
the
thing
was
preposterous
nevertheless
it
was
genuine
he
was
wearing
the
overcoat
he
had
worn
the
night
before
and
acting
on
impulse
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
pocket
and
drew
out
the
stranger
card
mr
john
loder
he
read
the
name
over
as
he
walked
along
and
it
mechanically
repeated
itself
in
his
brain
falling
into
measure
with
his
steps
who
was
john
loder
what
was
he
the
questions
tantalized
him
till
his
pace
unconsciously
increased
the
thought
that
two
men
so
absurdly
alike
could
inhabit
the
same
city
and
remain
unknown
to
each
other
faced
him
as
a
problem
it
tangled
with
his
personal
worries
and
aggravated
them
there
seemed
to
be
almost
a
danger
in
such
an
extraordinary
likeness
he
began
to
regret
his
impetuosity
in
thrusting
his
card
upon
the
man
then
again
how
he
had
let
himself
go
on
the
subject
of
lexington
how
narrowly
he
had
escaped
compromise
he
turned
hot
and
cold
at
the
recollection
of
what
he
had
said
and
what
he
might
have
said
then
for
the
first
time
he
paused
in
his
walk
and
looked
about
him
on
leaving
grosvenor
square
he
had
turned
westward
moving
rapidly
till
the
marble
arch
was
reached
there
still
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
he
had
crossed
the
roadway
to
the
edgware
road
passing
along
it
to
the
labyrinth
of
shabby
streets
that
lie
behind
paddington
now
as
he
glanced
about
him
he
saw
with
some
surprise
how
far
he
had
come
the
damp
remnants
of
the
fog
still
hung
about
the
in
a
filmy
veil
there
were
no
glimpses
of
green
to
break
the
monotony
of
tone
all
was
quiet
dingy
neglected
but
to
chilcote
the
shabbiness
was
restful
the
subdued
atmosphere
a
satisfaction
among
these
sad
houses
these
each
filled
with
his
own
concerns
he
experienced
a
sense
of
respite
and
relief
in
the
fashionable
streets
that
bounded
his
own
horizon
if
a
man
paused
in
his
walk
to
work
out
an
idea
he
instantly
drew
a
crowd
of
inquisitive
or
contemptuous
eyes
here
if
a
man
halted
for
half
an
hour
it
was
nobody
business
but
his
own
enjoying
this
thought
he
wandered
on
for
close
upon
an
hour
moving
from
one
street
to
another
with
steps
that
were
listless
or
rapid
as
inclination
prompted
then
still
acting
with
vagrant
aimlessness
he
stopped
in
his
wanderings
and
entered
a
small
the
place
was
and
dirty
the
air
hot
and
steaming
with
the
smell
of
food
but
chilcote
passed
through
the
door
and
moved
to
one
of
the
tables
with
no
expression
of
disgust
and
with
far
less
furtive
watchfulness
than
he
used
in
his
own
house
by
a
curious
mental
twist
he
felt
greater
freedom
larger
opportunities
in
drab
surroundings
such
as
these
than
in
the
broad
issues
and
weighty
responsibilities
of
his
own
life
choosing
a
corner
seat
he
called
for
coffee
and
there
protected
by
shadow
and
wrapped
in
cigarette
smoke
he
set
about
imagining
himself
some
vagrant
unit
who
had
slipped
his
moorings
and
was
blissfully
adrift
the
imagination
was
pleasant
while
it
lasted
but
with
him
nothing
was
permanent
of
late
the
greater
part
of
his
sufferings
had
been
comprised
in
the
irritable
fickleness
of
all
his
aims
the
distaste
for
and
impossibility
of
sustained
effort
in
any
direction
he
had
barely
lighted
a
second
cigarette
when
the
old
restlessness
fell
upon
him
he
stirred
nervously
in
his
seat
and
the
cigarette
was
scarcely
burned
out
when
he
rose
paid
his
small
bill
and
left
the
shop
outside
on
the
pavement
he
halted
pulled
out
his
watch
and
saw
that
two
hours
stretched
in
front
before
any
appointment
claimed
his
attention
he
wondered
vaguely
where
he
might
go
to
what
he
might
do
in
those
two
hours
in
the
last
few
minutes
a
distaste
for
solitude
had
risen
in
his
mind
giving
the
close
street
a
loneliness
that
had
escaped
him
before
as
he
stood
wavering
a
cab
passed
slowly
down
the
street
the
sight
of
a
man
roused
the
cabman
flicking
his
whip
he
passed
chilcote
close
feigning
to
pull
up
the
cab
suggested
civilization
chilcote
mind
veered
suddenly
and
he
raised
his
hand
the
vehicle
stopped
and
he
climbed
in
where
sir
the
cabman
peered
down
through
the
chilcote
raised
his
head
oh
anywhere
near
pall
mall
he
said
then
as
the
horse
started
forward
he
put
up
his
hand
and
shook
the
wait
he
called
i
changed
my
mind
drive
to
cadogan
gardens
no
the
distance
to
cadogan
gardens
was
covered
quickly
chilcote
had
hardly
realized
that
his
destination
was
reached
when
the
cab
pulled
up
jumping
out
he
paid
the
fare
and
walked
quickly
to
the
of
no
is
lady
astrupp
at
home
he
asked
sharply
as
the
door
swung
back
in
answer
to
his
knock
the
servant
drew
back
deferentially
her
ladyship
has
almost
finished
lunch
sir
he
said
for
answer
chilcote
stepped
through
the
and
walked
across
the
hall
all
right
he
said
but
do
disturb
her
on
my
account
i
wait
in
the
white
room
till
she
has
and
without
taking
further
notice
of
the
servant
he
began
to
mount
the
stairs
in
the
room
where
he
had
chosen
to
wait
a
pleasant
brightened
the
dull
january
afternoon
and
softened
the
thick
white
curtains
the
gilt
furniture
and
the
venetian
vases
filled
with
white
roses
moving
straight
forward
chilcote
paused
by
the
grate
and
stretched
his
hands
to
the
blaze
then
with
his
usual
instability
he
turned
and
passed
to
a
couch
that
stood
a
yard
or
two
away
on
the
couch
tucked
away
between
a
novel
and
a
crystal
was
a
white
persian
kitten
fast
asleep
chilcote
picked
up
the
ball
and
held
it
between
his
eyes
and
the
fire
then
he
laughed
superciliously
tossed
it
back
into
its
place
and
caught
the
kitten
tail
the
little
animal
stirred
stretched
itself
and
began
to
purr
at
the
same
moment
the
door
of
the
room
opened
chilcote
turned
round
i
particularly
said
you
were
not
to
be
disturbed
he
began
have
i
merited
displeasure
he
spoke
fast
with
the
uneasy
tone
that
so
often
underran
his
words
lady
astrupp
took
his
hand
with
a
confiding
gesture
and
smiled
never
displeasure
she
said
lingeringly
and
again
she
smiled
the
smile
might
have
struck
a
close
observer
as
faintly
artificial
but
what
man
in
chilcote
frame
of
mind
has
time
to
be
observant
where
women
are
concerned
the
manner
of
the
smile
was
very
sweet
and
almost
caressing
and
that
sufficed
what
have
you
been
doing
she
asked
after
a
moment
i
thought
i
was
quite
she
moved
across
to
the
couch
picked
up
the
kitten
and
kissed
it
is
this
sweet
she
added
she
looked
very
graceful
as
she
turned
holding
the
little
animal
up
she
was
a
woman
of
but
she
looked
a
girl
the
outline
of
her
face
was
pure
the
pale
gold
of
her
hair
almost
ethereal
and
her
tall
slight
figure
still
suggested
the
suppleness
the
possibility
of
future
development
that
belongs
to
youth
she
wore
a
gown
that
harmonized
with
the
room
and
with
the
delicacy
of
her
skin
now
sit
down
and
rest
or
walk
about
the
room
i
mind
she
nestled
into
the
couch
and
picked
up
the
crystal
ball
what
is
the
toy
for
chilcote
looked
at
her
from
the
against
which
he
was
resting
he
had
never
defined
the
precise
attraction
that
lillian
astrupp
held
for
him
her
shallowness
soothed
him
her
inconsequent
egotism
helped
him
to
forget
himself
she
never
asked
him
how
he
was
she
never
expected
impossibilities
she
let
him
come
and
go
and
act
as
he
pleased
never
demanding
reasons
like
the
kitten
she
was
charming
and
graceful
and
easily
amused
it
was
possible
that
also
like
the
kitten
she
could
scratch
and
be
spiteful
on
occasion
but
that
did
not
weigh
with
him
he
sometimes
expressed
a
vague
envy
of
the
late
lord
astrupp
but
even
had
circumstances
permitted
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
would
have
chosen
to
be
his
successor
lillian
as
a
friend
was
delightful
but
lillian
as
a
wife
would
have
been
a
different
consideration
what
is
the
toy
for
he
asked
again
she
looked
up
slowly
how
cruel
of
you
jack
it
is
my
very
latest
it
was
part
of
her
attraction
that
she
was
never
without
a
craze
each
new
one
was
as
fleeting
as
the
last
but
to
each
she
brought
the
same
delightfully
insincere
enthusiasm
the
same
picturesque
devotion
each
was
a
pose
but
she
posed
so
sweetly
that
nobody
lost
patience
you
must
laugh
she
protested
letting
the
kitten
slip
to
the
ground
i
had
lessons
at
five
guineas
each
from
the
most
fascinating
person
a
professional
and
i
becoming
quite
an
adept
of
course
i
have
been
much
beyond
the
milky
appearance
yet
but
the
milky
appearance
is
everything
you
know
the
rest
will
come
i
am
trying
to
persuade
blanche
to
let
me
have
a
pavilion
at
her
party
in
march
and
gaze
for
all
you
dull
political
again
she
smiled
chilcote
smiled
as
well
how
is
it
done
he
asked
momentarily
amused
oh
the
doing
is
quite
delicious
you
sit
at
a
table
with
the
ball
in
front
of
you
then
you
take
the
subject
hands
spread
them
out
on
the
table
and
stroke
them
very
softly
while
you
gaze
into
the
crystal
that
gets
up
the
sympathy
you
she
looked
up
innocently
shall
i
show
you
chilcote
moved
a
small
table
nearer
to
the
couch
and
spread
his
hands
upon
it
palms
downward
like
this
eh
he
said
then
a
ridiculous
nervousness
seized
him
and
he
moved
away
some
other
day
he
said
quickly
you
can
show
me
some
other
day
i
not
very
fit
this
if
lillian
felt
any
disappointment
she
showed
none
poor
old
thing
she
said
softly
try
to
sit
here
by
me
and
we
wo
bother
about
she
made
a
place
for
him
beside
her
and
as
he
dropped
into
it
she
took
his
hand
and
patted
it
sympathetically
the
touch
was
soothing
and
he
bore
it
patiently
enough
after
a
moment
she
lifted
the
hand
with
a
little
exclamation
of
reproof
you
degenerate
person
you
have
ceased
to
manicure
what
has
become
of
my
excellent
training
chilcote
laughed
run
to
seed
he
said
lightly
then
his
expression
and
tone
changed
when
a
man
gets
to
my
age
he
added
little
social
luxuries
do
seem
worth
while
the
social
necessities
are
irksome
enough
personally
i
envy
the
beggar
in
the
street
exempt
from
shaving
exempt
from
washing
lillian
raised
her
delicate
eyebrows
the
sentiment
was
beyond
her
perception
but
manicuring
she
said
reproachfully
when
you
have
such
nice
hands
it
was
your
hands
and
your
eyes
you
know
that
first
appealed
to
she
sighed
gently
with
a
touch
of
sentimental
remembrance
and
i
thought
it
so
strong
of
you
not
to
wear
rings
it
must
be
such
a
she
looked
down
at
her
own
fingers
glittering
with
jewels
but
the
momentary
pleasure
of
her
touch
was
gone
chilcote
drew
away
his
hand
and
picked
up
the
book
that
lay
between
them
other
men
shoes
he
read
a
novel
of
course
she
smiled
of
course
such
a
fantastic
story
two
men
changing
chilcote
rose
and
walked
back
to
the
changing
identities
he
said
with
a
touch
of
interest
yes
one
man
is
an
artist
the
other
a
millionaire
one
wants
to
know
what
fame
is
like
the
other
wants
to
know
how
it
feels
to
be
really
sinfully
rich
so
they
exchange
experiences
for
a
she
laughed
chilcote
laughed
as
well
but
how
he
asked
oh
i
told
you
the
idea
was
absurd
fancy
two
people
so
much
alike
that
neither
their
friends
nor
their
servants
see
any
difference
such
a
thing
could
be
could
it
chilcote
looked
down
at
the
fire
no
he
said
doubtfully
no
i
suppose
of
course
not
there
are
likenesses
but
not
freak
likenesses
like
chilcote
head
was
bent
as
she
spoke
but
at
the
last
words
he
lifted
it
by
jove
i
do
know
about
that
he
said
not
so
very
long
ago
i
saw
two
men
so
much
alike
that
i
i
he
stopped
lillian
smiled
he
colored
quickly
you
doubt
me
he
asked
my
dear
jack
her
voice
was
delicately
reproachful
then
you
think
that
my
my
imagination
has
been
playing
me
tricks
my
dear
boy
nothing
of
the
kind
come
back
to
your
place
and
tell
me
the
whole
tale
she
smiled
again
and
patted
the
couch
invitingly
but
chilcote
balance
had
been
upset
for
the
first
time
he
saw
lillian
as
one
of
the
watchful
suspecting
crowd
before
which
he
was
constantly
on
guard
acting
on
the
sensation
he
moved
suddenly
towards
the
door
i
i
have
an
appointment
at
the
house
he
said
quickly
i
look
in
another
day
when
when
i
better
company
i
know
i
a
bear
my
nerves
you
he
came
back
to
the
couch
and
took
her
hand
then
he
touched
her
cheek
for
an
instant
with
his
fingers
he
said
take
care
of
yourself
and
the
kitten
he
added
with
forced
gayety
as
he
crossed
the
room
that
afternoon
chilcote
nervous
condition
reached
its
height
all
day
he
had
avoided
the
climax
but
no
evasion
can
be
eternal
and
this
he
realized
as
he
sat
in
his
place
on
the
opposition
benches
during
the
of
wintry
twilight
that
precedes
the
of
the
lights
he
realized
it
in
that
but
the
application
of
the
knowledge
followed
later
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
question
the
government
on
some
point
relating
to
a
proposed
additional
at
talkley
the
naval
base
then
for
the
first
time
he
knew
that
the
sufferings
of
the
past
months
could
have
a
visible
as
well
as
a
hidden
side
could
disorganize
his
daily
routine
as
they
had
already
demoralized
his
will
and
character
the
thing
came
upon
him
with
extraordinary
lack
of
preparation
he
sat
through
the
twilight
with
tolerable
calm
his
nervousness
showing
only
in
the
occasional
lifting
of
his
hand
to
his
collar
and
the
frequent
changing
of
his
position
but
when
the
lights
were
turned
on
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
with
closed
eyes
he
became
conscious
of
a
curious
impression
a
disturbing
idea
that
through
his
closed
lids
he
could
see
the
faces
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
see
the
rows
of
eyes
sleepy
interested
or
vigilant
never
before
had
the
sensation
presented
itself
but
once
set
up
it
ran
through
all
his
susceptibilities
by
an
absurd
freak
of
fancy
those
varying
eyes
seemed
to
pierce
through
his
lids
almost
through
his
eyeballs
the
cold
perspiration
that
was
his
daily
horror
broke
out
on
his
forehead
and
at
the
same
moment
fraide
his
leader
turned
leaned
over
the
back
of
his
seat
and
touched
his
knee
chilcote
started
and
opened
his
eyes
i
i
believe
i
was
dozing
he
said
confusedly
fraide
smiled
his
dry
kindly
smile
a
fatal
admission
for
a
member
of
the
opposition
he
said
but
i
was
looking
for
you
earlier
in
the
day
chilcote
there
is
something
behind
this
persian
affair
i
believe
it
to
be
a
mere
first
move
on
russia
part
you
big
trading
people
will
find
it
worth
chilcote
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
i
do
know
he
said
i
scarcely
believe
in
it
lakely
put
a
match
to
the
powder
in
the
george
but
only
be
a
noise
and
a
puff
of
but
fraide
did
not
smile
what
is
the
feeling
down
at
wark
he
asked
has
it
awakened
any
interest
at
wark
oh
i
i
do
quite
know
i
have
been
a
little
out
of
touch
with
wark
in
the
last
few
weeks
a
man
has
so
many
private
affairs
to
look
to
he
was
uneasy
under
his
chief
scrutiny
fraide
lips
parted
as
if
to
make
reply
but
with
a
certain
dignified
reticence
he
closed
them
again
and
turned
away
chilcote
leaned
back
in
his
place
and
furtively
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
his
mind
was
possessed
by
one
consideration
the
consideration
of
himself
he
glanced
down
the
crowded
lighted
house
to
the
big
glass
doors
he
glanced
about
him
at
his
colleagues
indifferent
or
interested
then
surreptitiously
his
fingers
strayed
to
his
usually
he
carried
his
morphia
tabloids
with
him
but
by
a
lapse
of
memory
he
had
left
them
at
home
he
knew
this
nevertheless
he
continued
to
search
while
the
need
of
the
drug
rushed
through
him
with
a
sense
of
physical
sickness
he
lost
hold
on
the
business
of
the
house
unconsciously
he
half
rose
from
his
seat
the
man
next
him
looked
up
hold
your
ground
chilcote
he
said
rayforth
is
drying
with
a
wave
of
relief
chilcote
dropped
back
into
his
place
whatever
the
confusion
in
his
mind
it
was
evidently
not
obvious
in
his
face
rayforth
resumed
his
seat
there
was
the
usual
slight
stir
and
pause
then
salett
the
member
for
salchester
rose
with
salett
first
words
chilcote
hand
again
sought
his
pocket
and
again
his
eyes
strayed
towards
the
doors
but
fraide
erect
head
and
stiff
back
just
in
front
of
him
held
him
quiet
with
an
effort
he
pulled
out
his
notes
and
smoothed
them
nervously
but
though
his
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
pages
not
a
line
of
blessington
clear
writing
reached
his
mind
he
glanced
at
the
face
of
the
speaker
then
at
the
faces
on
the
treasury
bench
then
once
more
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
the
man
beside
him
saw
the
movement
funking
the
drydock
he
whispered
jestingly
no
chilcote
turned
to
him
suddenly
but
i
feel
beastly
have
felt
beastly
for
the
other
looked
at
him
more
closely
anything
wrong
he
asked
it
was
a
novel
experience
to
be
confided
in
by
chilcote
oh
it
the
infernal
as
he
said
it
it
seemed
to
him
suddenly
that
his
strength
gave
way
he
forgot
his
companion
his
position
everything
except
the
urgent
instinct
that
filled
mind
and
body
scarcely
knowing
what
he
did
he
rose
and
leaned
forward
to
whisper
in
fraide
ear
fraide
was
seen
to
turn
his
thin
face
interested
and
concerned
then
he
was
seen
to
nod
once
or
twice
in
acquiescence
and
a
moment
later
chilcote
stepped
quietly
out
of
his
place
one
or
two
men
spoke
to
him
as
he
hurried
from
the
house
but
he
shook
them
off
almost
uncivilly
and
making
for
the
nearest
exit
hailed
a
cab
the
drive
to
grosvenor
square
was
a
misery
time
after
time
he
changed
from
one
corner
of
the
cab
to
the
other
his
acute
internal
pains
prolonged
by
every
delay
and
increased
by
every
motion
at
last
weak
in
all
his
limbs
he
stepped
from
the
vehicle
at
his
own
door
entering
the
house
he
instantly
mounted
the
stairs
and
passed
to
his
own
rooms
opening
the
bedroom
door
he
peered
in
cautiously
then
pushed
the
door
wide
the
light
had
been
switched
on
but
the
room
was
empty
with
a
nervous
excitement
scarcely
to
be
kept
in
check
he
entered
shut
and
locked
the
door
then
moved
to
the
wardrobe
and
opening
it
drew
the
tube
of
tabloids
from
the
shelf
his
hand
shook
violently
as
he
carried
the
tube
to
the
table
the
strain
of
the
day
the
anxiety
of
the
past
hours
with
their
final
failure
had
found
sudden
expression
mixing
a
larger
dose
than
any
he
had
before
allowed
himself
he
swallowed
it
hastily
and
walking
across
the
room
threw
himself
fully
dressed
upon
the
bed
iv
to
those
whose
sphere
lies
in
the
west
of
london
fleet
street
is
little
more
than
a
name
and
clifford
inn
a
mere
dead
letter
yet
inn
lies
as
safely
stowed
away
in
the
shadow
of
the
law
courts
as
any
grave
under
a
country
church
wall
it
is
as
green
of
grass
as
gray
of
stone
as
irresponsive
to
the
passing
footstep
facing
the
of
its
little
court
stood
the
house
in
which
john
loder
had
his
rooms
taken
at
a
first
glance
the
house
had
the
deserted
air
of
an
office
inhabited
only
in
the
early
hours
but
as
night
fell
lights
would
be
seen
to
show
out
first
on
one
floor
then
on
another
faint
human
beacons
unconsciously
signalling
each
other
the
rooms
loder
inhabited
were
on
the
highest
floor
and
from
their
windows
one
might
gaze
philosophically
on
the
forgetting
the
uneven
pavement
and
the
worn
railing
that
hemmed
them
round
in
the
landing
outside
the
rooms
his
name
appeared
above
his
door
but
the
paint
had
been
soiled
by
time
and
the
letters
for
the
most
part
reduced
to
shadows
so
that
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
gaunt
staircase
and
bare
walls
the
place
had
a
cheerless
look
inside
however
the
effect
was
somewhat
mitigated
the
room
on
the
right
hand
as
one
entered
the
small
passage
that
served
as
hall
was
of
fair
size
though
the
paint
of
the
like
the
name
above
the
outer
door
had
long
ago
been
worn
to
a
dirty
and
nondescript
hue
and
the
floor
was
innocent
of
carpet
yet
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
fine
old
cromwell
table
and
on
the
plain
deal
and
along
the
were
some
valuable
books
political
and
historical
there
were
no
curtains
on
the
windows
and
a
common
with
a
green
shade
stood
on
a
desk
it
was
the
room
of
a
man
with
few
hobbies
and
no
pleasures
who
existed
because
he
was
alive
and
worked
because
he
must
three
nights
after
the
great
fog
john
loder
sat
by
his
desk
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
the
remains
of
a
very
frugal
supper
stood
on
the
and
in
the
grate
a
small
and
fire
was
burning
having
written
for
close
on
two
hours
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
stretched
his
cramped
fingers
then
he
yawned
rose
and
slowly
walked
across
the
room
reaching
the
he
took
a
pipe
from
the
and
some
tobacco
from
the
jar
that
stood
behind
the
books
his
face
looked
tired
and
a
little
worn
as
is
common
with
men
who
have
worked
long
at
an
uncongenial
task
shredding
the
tobacco
between
his
hands
he
slowly
filled
the
pipe
then
lighted
it
from
the
fire
with
a
spill
of
twisted
paper
almost
at
the
moment
that
he
applied
the
light
the
sound
of
steps
mounting
the
uncarpeted
stairs
outside
caught
his
attention
and
he
raised
his
head
to
listen
presently
the
steps
halted
and
he
heard
a
match
struck
the
stranger
was
evidently
uncertain
of
his
whereabouts
then
the
steps
moved
forward
again
and
paused
an
expression
of
surprise
crossed
loder
face
and
he
laid
down
his
pipe
as
the
visitor
knocked
he
walked
quietly
across
the
room
and
opened
the
door
the
passage
outside
was
dark
and
the
drew
back
before
the
light
from
the
room
mr
loder
he
began
interrogatively
then
all
at
once
he
laughed
in
embarrassed
apology
forgive
me
he
said
the
light
rather
dazzled
me
i
did
realize
who
it
loder
recognized
the
voice
as
belonging
to
his
acquaintance
of
the
fog
oh
it
you
he
said
wo
you
come
in
his
voice
was
a
little
cold
this
sudden
resurrection
left
him
surprised
and
not
quite
pleasantly
surprised
he
walked
back
to
the
fireplace
followed
by
his
guest
the
guest
seemed
nervous
and
agitated
i
must
apologize
for
the
hour
of
my
visit
he
said
my
my
time
is
not
quite
my
loder
waved
his
hand
whose
time
is
his
own
he
said
chilcote
encouraged
by
the
remark
drew
nearer
to
the
fire
until
this
moment
he
had
refrained
from
looking
directly
at
his
host
now
however
he
raised
his
eyes
and
despite
his
preparation
he
recoiled
unavoidably
before
the
extraordinary
resemblance
seen
here
in
the
casual
surroundings
of
a
badly
furnished
and
crudely
lighted
room
it
was
even
more
astounding
than
it
had
been
in
the
mystery
of
the
fog
forgive
me
he
said
again
it
is
physical
purely
physical
i
am
bowled
over
against
my
loder
smiled
the
slight
contempt
that
chilcote
had
first
inspired
rose
again
and
with
it
a
second
feeling
less
easily
defined
the
man
seemed
so
unstable
so
incapable
yet
so
grotesquely
suggestive
to
himself
the
likeness
is
rather
overwhelming
he
said
but
not
heavy
enough
to
sink
under
come
nearer
the
fire
what
brought
you
here
curiosity
there
was
a
wooden
by
the
fireplace
he
indicated
it
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
then
turned
and
took
up
his
smouldering
pipe
chilcote
watching
him
furtively
obeyed
the
gesture
and
sat
down
it
is
extraordinary
he
said
as
if
unable
to
dismiss
the
subject
it
it
is
quite
extraordinary
the
other
glanced
round
let
drop
it
he
said
it
so
confoundedly
then
his
tone
changed
wo
you
smoke
he
asked
chilcote
began
to
fumble
for
his
cigarettes
but
his
host
forestalled
him
taking
a
box
from
the
he
held
it
out
my
one
extravagance
he
said
ironically
my
resources
bind
me
to
one
and
i
think
i
have
made
a
wise
selection
it
is
about
the
only
vice
we
have
to
pay
for
six
times
he
glanced
sharply
at
the
face
so
absurdly
like
his
own
then
lighting
a
fresh
spill
offered
his
guest
a
light
chilcote
moistened
his
cigarette
and
leaned
forward
in
the
flare
of
the
paper
his
face
looked
set
and
anxious
but
loder
saw
that
the
lips
did
not
twitch
as
they
had
done
on
the
previous
occasion
that
he
had
given
him
a
light
and
a
look
of
comprehension
crossed
his
eyes
what
will
you
drink
or
rather
will
you
have
a
whiskey
i
keep
nothing
else
hospitality
is
one
of
the
debarred
chilcote
shook
his
head
i
seldom
drink
but
do
let
that
deter
loder
smiled
i
have
one
drink
in
the
hours
generally
at
two
when
my
night
work
is
done
a
solitary
man
has
to
look
where
he
is
you
work
till
two
two
or
chilcote
eyes
wandered
to
the
desk
you
write
he
asked
the
other
nodded
curtly
books
chilcote
tone
was
anxious
loder
laughed
and
the
bitter
note
showed
in
his
voice
no
not
books
he
said
chilcote
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
face
the
strong
wave
of
satisfaction
that
the
words
woke
in
him
was
difficult
to
conceal
what
is
your
work
loder
turned
aside
you
must
not
ask
that
he
said
shortly
when
a
man
has
only
one
capacity
and
the
capacity
has
no
outlet
he
is
apt
to
run
to
seed
in
a
wrong
direction
i
cultivate
weeds
at
abominable
labor
and
a
very
small
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
facing
his
visitor
his
attitude
was
a
curious
blending
of
pride
defiance
and
despondency
chilcote
leaned
forward
again
why
speak
of
yourself
like
that
you
are
a
man
of
intelligence
and
he
spoke
questioningly
anxiously
intelligence
and
education
loder
laughed
shortly
london
is
cemented
with
intelligence
and
education
what
is
education
the
court
dress
necessary
to
presentation
the
wig
and
gown
necessary
to
the
barrister
but
do
the
wig
and
gown
necessarily
mean
briefs
or
the
court
dress
royal
favor
education
is
the
accessory
it
is
influence
that
is
essential
you
should
know
chilcote
moved
restlessly
in
his
seat
you
talk
bitterly
he
said
the
other
looked
up
i
think
bitterly
which
is
worse
i
am
one
of
the
unlucky
beggars
who
in
the
expectation
of
money
has
been
denied
a
profession
even
a
trade
to
which
to
cling
in
time
of
shipwreck
and
who
when
disaster
comes
drift
out
to
sea
i
warned
you
the
other
night
to
steer
clear
of
me
i
come
under
the
head
of
flotsam
chilcote
face
lighted
you
came
a
cropper
he
asked
no
it
was
some
one
else
who
came
the
cropper
i
only
dealt
in
big
results
a
drop
from
a
probable
eighty
thousand
pounds
to
a
certain
eight
chilcote
glanced
up
how
did
you
take
it
he
asked
i
oh
i
was
then
i
had
a
good
many
hopes
and
a
lot
of
pride
but
there
is
no
place
for
either
in
a
working
but
your
people
my
last
relation
died
with
the
your
friends
loder
laid
down
his
pipe
i
told
you
i
was
he
said
with
the
tinge
of
humor
that
sometimes
crossed
his
manner
does
that
explain
things
i
had
never
taken
favors
in
prosperity
a
change
of
fortune
was
not
likely
to
alter
my
ways
as
i
have
said
i
was
he
smiled
when
i
realized
my
position
i
sold
all
my
belongings
with
the
exception
of
a
table
and
a
few
books
which
i
stored
i
put
on
a
and
let
my
beard
grow
then
with
my
entire
capital
in
my
pocket
i
left
england
without
saying
to
any
for
how
long
oh
for
six
years
i
wandered
half
over
europe
and
through
a
good
part
of
asia
in
the
and
then
then
oh
i
shaved
off
the
beard
and
came
back
to
london
he
looked
at
chilcote
partly
contemptuous
partly
amused
at
his
curiosity
but
chilcote
sat
staring
in
silence
the
domination
of
the
personality
and
the
futility
of
his
achievements
baffled
him
loder
saw
his
bewilderment
you
wonder
what
the
devil
i
came
into
the
world
for
he
said
i
sometimes
wonder
the
same
at
his
words
a
change
passed
over
chilcote
he
half
rose
then
dropped
back
into
his
seat
you
have
no
friends
he
said
your
life
is
worth
nothing
to
you
loder
raised
his
head
i
thought
i
had
conveyed
that
you
are
an
absolutely
free
no
man
is
free
who
works
for
his
bread
if
things
had
been
different
i
might
have
been
in
such
shoes
as
yours
sauntering
in
legislative
byways
my
hopes
turned
that
way
once
but
hopes
like
more
substantial
things
belong
to
the
past
he
stopped
abruptly
and
looked
at
his
companion
the
change
in
chilcote
had
become
more
acute
he
sat
fingering
his
cigarette
his
brows
drawn
down
his
lips
set
nervously
in
a
conflict
of
emotions
for
a
space
he
stayed
very
still
avoiding
loder
eyes
then
as
if
decision
had
suddenly
come
to
him
he
turned
and
met
his
gaze
how
if
there
was
a
future
he
said
as
well
as
a
past
v
for
the
space
of
a
minute
there
was
silence
in
the
room
then
outside
in
the
still
night
three
clocks
simultaneously
chimed
eleven
and
their
announcement
was
taken
up
and
echoed
by
half
a
dozen
others
loud
and
faint
hoarse
and
resonant
for
all
through
the
hours
of
darkness
the
neighborhood
of
fleet
street
is
alive
with
chimes
chilcote
startled
by
the
jangle
rose
from
his
seat
then
as
if
driven
by
an
uncontrollable
impulse
he
spoke
again
you
probably
think
i
am
mad
he
began
loder
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
i
am
not
so
presumptuous
he
said
quietly
for
a
space
the
other
eyed
him
silently
as
if
trying
to
gauge
his
thoughts
then
once
more
he
broke
into
speech
look
here
he
said
i
came
to
make
a
proposition
when
i
have
made
it
you
first
of
all
jeer
at
it
as
i
jeered
when
i
made
it
to
myself
then
you
see
its
possibilities
as
i
did
then
he
paused
and
glanced
round
the
room
nervously
then
you
accept
it
as
i
in
the
uneasy
haste
of
his
speech
his
words
broke
off
almost
unintelligibly
involuntarily
loder
lifted
his
head
to
retort
but
chilcote
put
up
his
hand
his
face
was
set
with
the
obstinate
determination
that
weak
men
sometime
exhibit
before
i
begin
i
want
to
say
that
i
am
not
drunk
that
i
am
neither
mad
nor
he
looked
fully
at
his
companion
with
his
restless
glance
i
am
quite
sane
quite
again
loder
essayed
to
speak
but
again
he
put
up
his
hand
no
hear
me
out
you
told
me
something
of
your
story
i
tell
you
something
of
mine
you
be
the
first
person
man
or
woman
that
i
have
confided
in
for
ten
years
you
say
you
have
been
treated
shabbily
i
have
treated
myself
shabbily
which
is
harder
to
reconcile
i
had
every
chance
and
i
chucked
every
chance
there
was
a
strained
pause
then
again
loder
lifted
his
head
morphia
he
said
very
quietly
chilcote
wheeled
round
with
a
scared
gesture
how
did
you
know
that
he
asked
sharply
the
other
smiled
it
was
guessing
it
was
even
deduction
you
told
me
or
as
good
as
told
me
in
the
fog
when
we
talked
of
lexington
you
were
unstrung
that
night
and
i
well
perhaps
one
gets
from
living
he
smiled
again
chilcote
collapsed
into
his
former
seat
and
passed
his
handkerchief
across
his
forehead
loder
watched
him
for
a
space
then
he
spoke
why
do
you
pull
up
he
said
you
are
a
young
man
still
why
do
you
drop
the
thing
before
it
gets
too
late
his
face
was
unsympathetic
and
below
the
question
in
his
voice
lay
a
note
of
hard
ness
chilcote
returned
his
glance
the
suggestion
of
reproof
had
accentuated
his
pallor
under
his
excitement
he
looked
ill
and
worn
you
might
talk
till
doomsday
but
every
word
would
be
wasted
he
said
irritably
i
past
praying
for
by
something
like
six
then
why
come
here
loder
was
pulling
hard
on
his
pipe
i
not
a
dealer
in
i
do
require
chilcote
rose
again
he
was
still
agitated
but
the
agitation
was
quieter
i
want
a
much
more
expensive
thing
than
sympathy
and
i
am
willing
to
pay
for
the
other
turned
and
looked
at
him
i
have
no
possession
in
the
world
that
would
be
worth
a
fiver
to
you
he
said
coldly
you
either
under
a
delusion
or
you
wasting
my
chilcote
laughed
nervously
wait
he
said
wait
i
only
ask
you
to
wait
first
let
me
sketch
you
my
position
it
wo
take
many
words
my
grandfather
was
a
chilcote
of
westmoreland
he
was
one
of
the
first
of
his
day
and
his
class
to
recognize
that
there
was
a
future
in
trade
so
breaking
his
own
little
twig
from
the
family
tree
he
went
south
to
wark
and
entered
a
firm
in
thirty
years
time
he
died
the
owner
of
one
of
the
biggest
trades
in
england
having
married
the
daughter
of
his
chief
my
father
was
and
still
at
oxford
when
he
inherited
almost
his
first
act
was
to
reverse
my
early
move
by
going
north
and
piecing
together
the
family
friendship
he
married
his
first
cousin
and
then
with
the
chilcote
prestige
revived
and
the
shipping
money
to
back
it
he
entered
on
his
ambition
which
was
to
represent
east
wark
in
the
conservative
interest
it
was
a
big
fight
but
he
won
as
much
by
personal
influence
as
by
any
other
he
was
an
aristocrat
but
he
was
a
keen
as
well
the
combination
carries
weight
with
your
lower
classes
he
never
did
much
in
the
house
but
he
was
a
power
to
his
party
in
wark
they
still
use
his
name
there
to
conjure
loder
leaned
forward
interestedly
robert
chilcote
he
said
i
have
heard
of
him
one
of
those
fine
unostentatious
figures
strong
in
action
a
little
narrow
in
outlook
perhaps
but
essential
to
a
country
staying
power
you
have
every
reason
to
be
proud
of
your
chilcote
laughed
suddenly
how
easily
we
sum
up
when
a
matter
is
impersonal
my
father
may
have
been
a
fine
figure
but
he
should
have
left
me
to
climb
to
his
loder
eyes
questioned
in
his
newly
awakened
interest
he
had
let
his
pipe
go
out
do
you
grasp
my
meaning
chilcote
went
on
my
father
died
and
i
was
elected
for
east
wark
you
may
say
that
if
i
had
no
real
inclination
for
the
position
i
could
have
kicked
but
i
tell
you
i
could
every
local
interest
political
and
commercial
hung
upon
the
candidate
being
a
chilcote
i
did
what
eight
men
out
of
ten
would
have
done
i
yielded
to
it
was
a
fine
opening
the
words
escaped
loder
most
prisons
have
wide
gates
chilcote
laughed
again
unpleasantly
that
was
six
years
ago
i
had
started
on
the
morphia
tack
four
years
earlier
but
up
to
my
father
death
i
had
it
under
my
thumb
or
believed
i
had
and
in
the
realization
of
my
new
responsibilities
and
the
excitement
of
the
political
fight
i
almost
put
it
aside
for
several
months
after
i
entered
parliament
i
worked
i
believe
i
made
one
speech
that
marked
me
as
a
coming
he
laughed
derisively
i
even
married
married
yes
a
girl
of
nineteen
the
ward
of
a
great
statesman
it
was
a
brilliant
marriage
politically
as
well
as
socially
but
it
did
work
i
was
born
without
the
capacity
for
love
first
the
social
life
palled
on
me
then
my
work
grew
irksome
there
was
only
one
factor
to
make
life
endurable
morphia
before
six
months
were
out
i
had
fully
admitted
but
your
wife
oh
my
wife
knew
nothing
knows
nothing
it
is
the
political
business
the
beastly
routine
of
the
political
life
that
is
wearing
me
he
stopped
nervously
then
hurried
on
again
i
tell
you
it
hell
to
see
the
same
faces
to
sit
in
the
same
seat
day
in
day
out
knowing
all
the
time
that
you
must
hold
yourself
in
hand
must
keep
your
grip
on
the
reins
it
is
always
possible
to
apply
for
the
chiltern
to
retire
possible
to
retire
chilcote
broke
into
a
loud
sarcastic
laugh
you
do
know
what
the
local
pressure
of
a
place
like
wark
stands
for
twenty
times
i
have
been
within
an
ace
of
chucking
the
whole
thing
once
last
year
i
wrote
privately
to
vale
one
of
our
big
men
there
and
hinted
that
my
health
was
bad
two
hours
after
he
had
read
my
letter
he
was
in
my
study
had
i
been
in
greenland
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
no
resignation
is
a
meaningless
word
to
a
man
like
loder
looked
down
i
see
he
said
slowly
i
then
you
see
everything
the
difficulty
the
isolation
of
the
position
five
years
ago
three
even
two
years
ago
i
was
able
to
endure
it
now
it
gets
more
unbearable
with
every
month
the
day
is
bound
to
come
when
when
he
paused
hesitating
nervously
when
it
will
be
physically
impossible
for
me
to
be
at
my
loder
remained
silent
physically
impossible
chilcote
repeated
excitedly
until
lately
i
was
able
to
calculate
to
count
upon
myself
to
some
extent
but
yesterday
i
received
a
shock
yesterday
i
discovered
that
that
again
he
hesitated
painfully
that
i
have
passed
the
stage
when
one
may
the
situation
was
growing
more
embarrassing
to
hide
its
awkwardness
loder
moved
back
to
the
grate
and
rebuilt
the
fire
which
had
fallen
low
chilcote
still
excited
by
his
unusual
vehemence
followed
him
taking
up
a
position
by
the
mantelpiece
well
he
said
looking
down
very
slowly
loder
rose
from
his
task
well
he
reiterated
have
you
nothing
to
say
nothing
except
that
your
story
is
unique
and
that
i
suppose
i
am
flattered
by
your
his
voice
was
intentionally
brusque
chilcote
paid
no
attention
to
the
voice
taking
a
step
forward
he
laid
his
fingers
on
the
lapel
of
loder
coat
i
have
passed
the
stage
where
i
can
count
upon
myself
he
said
and
i
want
to
count
upon
somebody
else
i
want
to
keep
my
place
in
the
eyes
and
yet
be
free
loder
drew
back
involuntarily
contempt
struggling
with
bewilderment
in
his
expression
chilcote
lifted
his
head
by
an
extraordinary
chance
he
said
you
can
do
for
me
what
no
other
man
in
creation
could
do
it
was
suggested
to
me
unconsciously
by
the
story
of
a
book
a
book
in
which
men
change
identities
i
saw
nothing
in
it
at
the
time
but
this
morning
as
i
lay
in
bed
sick
with
yesterday
fiasco
it
came
back
to
me
it
rushed
over
my
mind
in
an
inspiration
it
will
save
me
and
make
you
i
not
insulting
you
though
you
like
to
think
without
remark
loder
freed
himself
from
the
other
touch
and
walked
back
to
his
desk
his
anger
his
pride
and
against
his
will
his
excitement
were
all
aroused
he
sat
down
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
desk
and
took
his
face
between
his
hands
the
man
behind
him
undoubtedly
talked
madness
but
after
five
years
of
dreary
sanity
madness
had
a
fascination
against
all
reason
it
stirred
and
roused
him
for
one
instant
his
pride
and
his
anger
faltered
before
it
then
flowed
back
again
and
adjusted
the
balance
you
propose
he
said
slowly
that
for
a
consideration
of
money
i
should
trade
on
the
likeness
between
us
and
become
your
dummy
when
you
are
otherwise
engaged
chilcote
colored
you
are
unpleasantly
blunt
he
said
but
i
have
caught
your
meaning
in
the
rough
loder
nodded
curtly
then
take
my
advice
and
go
home
he
said
the
other
returned
his
glance
and
as
their
eyes
met
loder
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
admit
that
though
the
face
was
disturbed
it
had
no
traces
of
insanity
i
make
you
a
proposal
chilcote
repeated
nervously
but
with
distinctness
do
you
accept
for
an
instant
loder
was
at
a
loss
to
find
a
reply
sufficiently
final
chilcote
broke
in
upon
the
pause
after
all
he
urged
what
i
ask
of
you
is
a
simple
thing
merely
to
carry
through
my
routine
duties
for
a
week
or
two
occasionally
when
i
find
my
endurance
giving
way
when
a
respite
becomes
essential
the
work
would
be
nothing
to
a
man
in
your
state
of
mind
the
pay
anything
you
like
to
in
his
eagerness
he
had
followed
loder
to
the
desk
wo
you
give
me
an
answer
i
told
you
i
am
neither
mad
nor
loder
pushed
back
the
scattered
papers
that
lay
under
his
arm
only
a
lunatic
would
propose
such
a
he
said
brusquely
and
without
feeling
why
the
other
lips
parted
for
a
quick
retort
then
in
a
surprising
way
the
retort
seemed
to
fail
him
oh
because
the
thing
is
feasible
practicable
from
any
point
of
chilcote
stepped
closer
why
he
insisted
because
it
could
work
man
could
hold
for
a
dozen
chilcote
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
his
arm
but
why
he
urged
why
give
me
one
unanswerable
loder
shook
off
the
hand
and
laughed
but
below
his
laugh
lay
a
suggestion
of
the
other
excitement
again
the
scene
stirred
him
against
his
sounder
judgment
though
his
reply
when
it
came
was
firm
enough
as
for
reasons
he
said
there
are
a
hundred
if
i
had
time
to
name
them
take
it
for
the
sake
of
supposition
that
i
were
to
accept
your
offer
i
should
take
my
place
in
your
house
at
let
us
say
at
dinnertime
your
man
gets
me
into
your
and
there
at
the
very
start
you
have
the
first
suspicion
set
up
he
has
probably
known
you
for
years
known
you
until
every
turn
of
your
appearance
voice
and
manner
is
far
more
familiar
to
him
than
it
is
to
you
there
are
no
eyes
like
a
i
have
thought
of
that
my
servant
and
my
secretary
can
both
be
changed
i
will
do
the
thing
loder
glanced
at
him
in
surprise
the
madness
had
more
method
than
he
had
believed
then
as
he
still
looked
a
fresh
idea
struck
him
and
he
laughed
you
have
entirely
forgotten
one
thing
he
said
you
can
hardly
dismiss
your
my
wife
does
again
loder
laughed
i
afraid
i
scarcely
agree
the
complications
would
be
slightly
slightly
he
paused
chilcote
latent
irritability
broke
out
suddenly
look
here
he
said
this
is
a
chaffing
matter
it
may
be
moonshine
to
you
but
reality
to
again
loder
took
his
face
between
his
hands
do
ridicule
the
idea
i
in
dead
loder
said
nothing
think
think
it
over
before
you
for
a
moment
loder
remained
motionless
then
h
rose
suddenly
pushing
back
his
chair
tush
man
you
do
know
what
you
say
the
fact
of
your
being
married
bars
it
ca
you
see
that
again
chilcote
caught
his
arm
you
misunderstand
he
said
you
mistake
the
position
i
tell
you
my
wife
and
i
are
nothing
to
each
other
she
goes
her
way
i
go
mine
we
have
our
own
friends
our
own
rooms
marriage
actual
marriage
enter
the
question
we
meet
occasionally
at
meals
and
at
other
houses
sometimes
we
go
out
together
for
the
sake
of
appearances
beyond
that
nothing
if
you
take
up
my
life
nobody
in
it
will
trouble
you
less
than
eve
i
can
promise
he
laughed
unsteadily
loder
face
remained
unmoved
even
granting
that
he
said
the
thing
is
still
why
there
is
the
house
the
position
there
would
be
untenable
a
man
is
known
there
as
he
is
known
in
his
own
he
drew
away
from
chilcote
touch
very
possibly
very
chilcote
laughed
quickly
and
excitedly
but
what
club
is
without
its
eccentric
member
i
am
glad
you
spoke
of
that
i
am
glad
you
raised
that
point
it
was
a
long
time
ago
that
i
hit
upon
a
reputation
for
moods
as
a
shield
for
for
other
things
and
the
more
useful
it
has
become
the
more
i
have
let
it
grow
i
tell
you
you
might
go
down
to
the
house
and
spend
the
whole
day
without
speaking
to
even
nodding
to
a
single
man
and
as
long
as
you
were
i
to
outward
appearances
no
one
would
raise
an
eyebrow
in
the
same
way
you
might
vote
in
my
place
ask
a
question
make
a
speech
if
you
wanted
to
at
the
word
speech
loder
turned
involuntarily
for
a
fleeting
second
the
coldness
of
his
manner
dropped
and
his
face
changed
chilcote
with
his
nervous
quickness
of
perception
saw
the
alteration
and
a
new
look
crossed
his
own
face
why
not
he
said
quickly
you
once
had
ambitions
in
that
direction
why
not
renew
the
ambitions
and
drop
back
from
the
mountains
into
the
gutter
loder
smiled
and
slowly
shook
his
head
better
to
live
for
one
day
than
to
exist
for
a
hundred
voice
trembled
with
anxiety
for
the
third
time
he
extended
his
hand
and
touched
the
other
this
time
loder
did
not
shake
off
the
detaining
hand
he
scarcely
seemed
to
feel
its
pressure
look
chilcote
fingers
tightened
a
little
while
ago
you
talked
of
influence
here
you
can
step
into
a
position
built
by
influence
you
might
do
all
you
once
hoped
to
do
loder
suddenly
lifted
his
head
absurd
he
said
absurd
such
a
scheme
was
never
carried
precisely
why
it
will
succeed
people
never
suspect
until
they
have
a
precedent
will
you
consider
it
at
least
consider
it
remember
if
there
is
a
risk
it
is
i
who
am
running
it
on
your
own
showing
you
have
no
position
to
the
other
laughed
curtly
before
i
go
will
you
promise
me
to
consider
it
then
you
will
send
me
your
decision
by
wire
i
wo
take
your
answer
loder
freed
his
arm
abruptly
why
not
he
asked
chilcote
smiled
nervously
because
i
know
men
and
men
temptations
we
are
all
very
strong
till
the
quick
is
touched
then
we
all
wince
it
morphia
with
one
man
ambitions
with
another
in
each
case
only
a
matter
of
sooner
or
he
laughed
in
his
satirical
unstrung
way
and
held
out
his
hand
have
my
address
he
said
au
loder
pressed
the
hand
and
dropped
it
goodbye
he
said
meaningly
then
he
crossed
the
room
quietly
and
held
the
door
open
he
said
again
as
the
other
passed
him
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
chilcote
paused
au
revoir
he
corrected
with
emphasis
until
the
last
echo
of
his
visitor
steps
had
died
away
loder
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
door
then
closing
it
quietly
he
turned
and
looked
round
the
room
for
a
considerable
space
he
stood
there
as
if
weighing
the
merits
of
each
object
then
very
slowly
he
moved
to
one
of
the
drew
out
may
parliamentary
practice
and
carrying
it
to
the
desk
readjusted
the
lamp
vi
all
the
next
day
chilcote
moved
in
a
fever
of
excitement
hot
with
hope
one
moment
cold
with
fever
the
next
he
rushed
with
restless
energy
into
every
task
that
presented
itself
only
to
drop
it
as
speedily
twice
during
the
morning
he
drove
to
the
entrance
of
clifford
inn
but
each
time
his
courage
failed
him
and
he
returned
to
grosvenor
square
to
learn
that
the
expected
message
from
loder
had
not
come
it
was
a
wearing
condition
of
mind
but
at
worst
it
was
scarcely
more
than
an
exaggeration
of
what
his
state
had
been
for
months
and
made
but
little
obvious
difference
in
his
bearing
or
manner
in
the
afternoon
he
took
his
place
in
the
house
but
though
it
was
his
first
appearance
since
his
failure
of
two
days
ago
he
drew
but
small
personal
notice
when
he
chose
his
manner
could
repel
advances
with
extreme
effect
and
of
late
men
had
been
prone
to
draw
away
from
him
in
one
of
the
lobbies
he
encountered
fraide
surrounded
by
a
group
of
friends
with
his
usual
furtive
haste
he
would
have
passed
on
but
moving
away
from
his
party
the
old
man
accosted
him
he
was
always
courteously
particular
in
his
treatment
of
chilcote
as
the
husband
of
his
ward
and
godchild
better
chilcote
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
at
the
sound
of
the
low
rather
formal
tones
so
characteristic
of
the
old
statesman
a
hundred
memories
rose
to
chilcote
mind
a
hundred
hours
distasteful
in
the
living
and
unbearable
in
the
recollection
and
with
them
the
new
flash
of
hope
the
new
possibility
of
freedom
in
a
sudden
rush
of
confidence
he
turned
to
his
leader
i
believe
i
found
a
remedy
for
my
nerves
he
said
i
i
believe
i
going
to
be
anew
he
laughed
with
a
touch
of
excitement
fraide
pressed
his
fingers
kindly
that
is
right
he
said
that
is
right
i
called
at
grosvenor
square
this
morning
but
eve
told
me
your
illness
of
the
other
day
was
not
serious
she
was
very
busy
this
morning
she
could
only
spare
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
is
indefatigable
over
the
social
side
of
your
prospects
chilcote
you
owe
her
a
large
debt
a
popular
wife
means
a
great
deal
to
a
the
steady
eyes
of
his
companion
disturbed
chilcote
he
drew
away
his
hand
eve
is
unique
he
said
vaguely
fraide
smiled
that
is
right
he
said
again
admiration
is
too
largely
excluded
from
modern
and
with
a
courteous
excuse
he
rejoined
his
friends
it
was
before
chilcote
could
desert
the
house
but
the
moment
departure
was
possible
he
hurried
to
grosvenor
square
as
he
entered
the
house
the
hall
was
empty
he
swore
irritably
under
his
breath
and
pressed
the
nearest
bell
since
his
momentary
exaltation
in
fraide
presence
his
spirits
had
steadily
fallen
until
now
they
hung
at
the
lowest
ebb
as
he
waited
in
unconcealed
impatience
for
an
answer
to
his
summons
he
caught
sight
of
his
man
allsopp
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
come
here
he
called
pleased
to
find
some
one
upon
whom
to
vent
his
irritation
has
that
wire
come
for
me
no
sir
i
inquired
five
minutes
inquire
yes
allsopp
disappeared
a
second
after
his
disappearance
the
bell
of
the
hall
door
whizzed
loudly
chileote
started
all
sudden
sounds
like
all
strong
lights
affected
him
he
half
moved
to
the
door
then
stopped
himself
with
a
short
exclamation
at
the
same
instant
allsopp
reappeared
chilcote
turned
on
him
excitedly
what
the
devil
the
meaning
of
this
he
said
a
battery
of
servants
in
the
house
and
nobody
to
open
the
hall
door
allsopp
looked
embarrassed
crapham
is
coming
directly
sir
he
only
left
the
hall
to
ask
jeffries
chilcote
turned
confound
crapham
he
exclaimed
go
and
open
the
door
allsopp
hesitated
his
dignity
struggling
with
his
obedience
as
he
waited
the
bell
sounded
again
did
you
hear
me
chilcote
said
yes
allsopp
crossed
the
hall
as
the
door
was
opened
chilcote
passed
his
handkerchief
from
one
hand
to
the
other
in
the
tension
of
hope
and
fear
then
as
the
sound
of
his
own
name
in
the
shrill
tones
of
a
reached
his
ears
he
let
the
handkerchief
drop
to
the
ground
allsopp
took
the
yellow
envelope
and
carried
it
to
his
master
a
telegram
sir
he
said
and
the
boy
wishes
to
know
if
there
is
an
picking
up
chilcote
handkerchief
he
turned
aside
with
elaborate
dignity
chilcote
hands
were
so
unsteady
that
he
could
scarcely
insert
his
finger
under
the
flap
of
the
envelope
tearing
off
a
corner
he
wrenched
the
covering
apart
and
smoothed
out
the
flimsy
pink
paper
the
message
was
very
simple
consisting
of
but
seven
words
shall
expect
you
at
eleven
he
read
it
two
or
three
times
then
he
looked
up
no
answer
he
said
mechanically
and
to
his
own
ears
the
relief
in
his
voice
sounded
harsh
and
unnatural
exactly
as
the
clocks
chimed
eleven
chilcote
mounted
the
stairs
to
loder
rooms
but
this
time
there
was
more
of
haste
than
of
uncertainty
in
his
steps
and
reaching
the
landing
he
crossed
it
in
a
couple
of
strides
and
knocked
feverishly
on
the
door
it
opened
at
once
and
loder
stood
before
him
the
occasion
was
peculiar
for
a
moment
neither
spoke
each
involuntarily
looked
at
the
other
with
new
eyes
and
under
changed
conditions
each
had
assumed
a
fresh
in
the
other
thought
the
passing
astonishment
the
curiosity
that
had
previously
tinged
their
relationship
was
cast
aside
never
to
be
reassumed
in
each
the
other
saw
himself
and
something
more
as
usual
loder
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
i
was
expecting
you
he
said
wo
you
come
in
the
words
were
almost
the
same
as
his
words
of
the
night
before
but
his
voice
had
a
different
ring
just
as
his
face
when
he
drew
back
into
the
room
had
a
different
expression
a
suggestion
of
decision
and
energy
that
had
been
lacking
before
chilcote
caught
the
difference
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
and
for
a
bare
second
a
flicker
of
something
like
jealousy
touched
him
but
the
sensation
was
fleeting
i
have
to
thank
you
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
he
was
too
well
bred
to
show
by
a
hint
that
he
understood
the
drop
in
the
principles
but
loder
broke
down
the
artifice
let
be
straight
with
each
other
since
everybody
else
has
to
be
deceived
he
said
taking
the
other
hand
you
have
nothing
to
thank
me
for
and
you
know
it
it
a
touch
of
the
old
adam
you
tempted
me
and
i
he
laughed
but
below
the
laugh
ran
a
note
of
something
like
triumph
the
curious
triumph
of
a
man
who
has
known
the
tyranny
of
strength
and
suddenly
appreciates
the
freedom
of
a
weakness
you
fully
realize
the
thing
you
have
proposed
he
added
in
a
different
tone
it
not
too
late
to
retract
even
chilcote
opened
his
lips
paused
then
laughed
in
imitation
of
his
companion
but
the
laugh
sounded
forced
my
dear
fellow
he
said
at
last
i
never
never
then
the
bargain
loder
walked
slowly
across
the
room
and
taking
up
his
position
by
the
looked
at
his
companion
the
similarity
between
them
as
they
faced
each
other
seemed
abnormal
defying
even
the
closest
scrutiny
and
yet
so
mysterious
is
nature
even
in
her
lapses
they
were
subtly
indefinably
different
chilcote
was
loder
deprived
of
one
essential
loder
chilcote
with
that
essential
bestowed
the
difference
lay
neither
in
feature
in
coloring
nor
in
height
but
in
that
baffling
illusive
inner
illumination
that
some
call
individuality
and
others
soul
something
of
this
idea
misted
and
tangled
by
nervous
imagination
crossed
chilcote
mind
in
that
moment
of
scrutiny
but
he
shrank
from
it
apprehensively
i
i
came
to
discuss
details
he
said
quickly
crossing
the
space
that
divided
him
from
his
host
shall
we
are
you
he
paused
uneasily
i
entirely
in
your
loder
spoke
with
abrupt
decision
moving
to
the
table
he
indicated
a
chair
and
drew
another
forward
for
himself
both
men
sat
down
chilcote
leaned
forward
resting
elbows
on
the
table
there
will
be
several
things
to
consider
he
began
nervously
looking
across
at
the
other
quite
loder
glanced
back
appreciatively
i
thought
about
those
things
the
better
part
of
last
night
to
begin
with
i
must
study
your
handwriting
i
guarantee
to
get
it
right
but
it
will
take
a
a
month
well
perhaps
three
weeks
we
must
make
a
mess
of
chilcote
shifted
his
position
three
weeks
he
repeated
could
you
no
i
loder
spoke
authoritatively
i
might
never
want
to
put
pen
to
paper
but
on
the
other
hand
i
might
have
to
sign
a
check
one
he
laughed
have
you
ever
thought
of
that
that
i
might
have
to
or
want
to
sign
a
check
no
i
confess
that
escaped
you
risk
your
fortune
that
you
may
keep
the
place
it
bought
for
you
loder
laughed
again
how
do
you
know
that
i
am
not
a
blackguard
he
added
how
do
you
know
that
i
wo
clear
out
one
day
and
leave
you
high
and
dry
what
is
to
prevent
john
chilcote
from
realizing
forty
or
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
then
making
himself
scarce
you
wo
do
that
chilcote
said
with
unusual
decision
i
told
you
your
weakness
last
night
and
it
was
money
money
is
the
rock
you
split
then
you
think
i
split
upon
some
rock
but
that
beyond
the
question
to
get
to
business
again
you
risk
my
studying
your
signature
chilcote
nodded
right
now
item
loder
counted
on
his
fingers
i
must
know
the
names
and
faces
of
your
men
friends
as
far
as
i
can
your
woman
friends
do
count
while
i
you
you
will
be
he
laughed
again
pleasantly
but
the
men
are
essential
the
backbone
of
the
whole
i
have
no
men
friends
i
do
trust
the
idea
of
acquaintances
chilcote
looked
up
sharply
i
think
we
score
there
he
said
i
have
a
reputation
for
that
will
carry
you
anywhere
they
tell
me
i
can
look
through
the
most
substantial
man
in
the
house
as
if
he
were
gossamer
though
i
may
have
lunched
with
him
the
same
loder
smiled
by
jove
he
exclaimed
fate
must
have
been
constructing
this
before
either
of
us
was
born
it
dovetails
ridiculously
but
i
must
know
your
colleagues
even
if
it
only
to
cut
them
you
have
to
take
me
to
the
impossible
not
at
all
again
the
tone
of
authority
fell
to
loder
i
can
pull
my
hat
over
my
eyes
and
turn
up
my
nobody
will
notice
me
we
can
choose
the
fall
of
the
afternoon
i
promise
you
be
all
suppose
the
likeness
should
leak
out
it
a
loder
laughed
confidently
tush
man
risk
is
the
salt
of
life
i
must
see
you
at
your
post
and
i
must
see
the
men
you
work
he
rose
walked
across
the
room
and
took
his
pipe
from
the
rack
when
i
go
in
for
a
thing
i
like
to
go
in
over
head
and
ears
he
added
as
he
opened
his
his
pipe
filled
he
resumed
his
seat
resting
his
elbows
on
the
table
in
unconscious
imitation
of
chilcote
got
a
match
he
said
laconically
holding
out
his
band
in
response
chilcote
drew
his
from
his
pocket
and
struck
a
light
as
their
hands
touched
an
exclamation
escaped
him
by
jove
he
said
with
a
fretful
mixture
of
disappointment
and
surprise
i
had
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
annoyed
interest
on
loder
extended
hand
loder
following
his
glance
smiled
odd
that
we
should
both
have
overlooked
it
it
clean
escaped
my
mind
it
rather
an
ugly
he
lifted
his
hand
till
the
light
fell
more
fully
on
it
above
the
second
joint
of
the
third
finger
ran
a
jagged
furrow
the
reminder
of
a
wound
that
had
once
laid
bare
the
bone
chilcote
leaned
forward
how
did
you
come
by
it
he
asked
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
that
ancient
the
results
are
enough
it
very
awkward
very
annoying
chilcote
spirits
at
all
times
overeasily
played
upon
were
damped
by
this
obstacle
loder
still
looking
at
his
hand
did
seem
to
hear
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
he
said
each
wear
two
rings
on
the
third
finger
of
the
left
hand
two
rings
ought
to
cover
he
made
a
speculative
measurement
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
chilcote
still
looked
irritable
and
disturbed
i
detest
rings
i
never
wear
loder
raised
his
eyes
calmly
neither
do
i
he
said
but
there
no
reason
for
but
chilcote
irritability
was
started
he
pushed
back
his
chair
i
do
like
the
idea
he
said
the
other
eyed
him
amusedly
what
a
queer
beggar
you
are
he
said
you
waive
the
danger
of
a
man
signing
your
checks
and
shy
at
wearing
a
piece
of
jewelry
i
have
a
fair
share
of
individuality
to
chilcote
moved
restlessly
everybody
knows
i
detest
everybody
knows
you
are
capricious
it
got
to
be
the
rings
or
nothing
so
far
as
i
make
chilcote
again
altered
his
position
avoiding
the
other
eyes
at
last
after
a
struggle
with
himself
he
looked
up
i
suppose
you
right
he
said
have
it
your
own
it
was
the
first
small
tangible
concession
to
the
stronger
will
loder
took
his
victory
quietly
good
he
said
then
it
all
straight
sailing
except
for
the
matter
of
the
the
chilcote
hazarded
the
word
uncertainly
there
was
a
faint
pause
then
loder
laughed
brusquely
my
pay
the
other
was
embarrassed
i
did
want
to
put
it
quite
like
but
that
was
what
you
thought
why
are
you
never
honest
even
with
yourself
chilcote
drew
his
chair
closer
to
the
table
he
did
not
attend
to
the
other
remark
but
his
fingers
strayed
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
fumbled
there
loder
saw
the
gesture
look
here
he
said
you
are
overtaxing
yourself
the
affair
of
the
pay
is
pressing
we
shelve
it
to
another
night
you
look
tired
chilcote
lifted
his
eyes
with
a
relieved
glance
thanks
i
do
feel
a
bit
fagged
if
i
may
i
have
that
whiskey
that
i
refused
last
why
loder
rose
at
once
and
crossed
to
a
cupboard
in
the
wall
in
silence
he
brought
out
whiskey
glasses
and
a
siphon
of
say
when
he
said
lifting
the
whiskey
now
and
i
have
plain
water
instead
of
soda
if
it
all
the
oh
loder
recrossed
the
room
instantly
his
back
was
turned
chilcote
drew
a
couple
of
tabloids
from
his
pocket
and
dropped
them
into
his
glass
as
the
other
came
slowly
back
he
laughed
nervously
thanks
see
to
your
own
drink
now
i
can
manage
he
took
the
jug
unceremoniously
and
carefully
guarding
his
glass
from
the
light
poured
in
the
water
with
excited
haste
what
shall
we
drink
to
he
said
loder
methodically
mixed
his
own
drink
and
lifted
the
glass
oh
to
the
career
of
john
chilcote
he
answered
for
an
instant
the
other
hesitated
there
was
something
prophetic
in
the
sound
of
the
toast
but
he
shook
the
feeling
off
and
held
up
his
glass
to
the
career
of
john
chilcote
he
said
with
another
unsteady
laugh
vii
it
was
a
little
less
than
three
weeks
since
chilcote
and
loder
had
drunk
their
toast
and
again
loder
was
seated
at
his
desk
his
head
was
bent
and
his
hand
moved
carefully
as
he
traced
line
after
line
of
meaningless
words
on
a
sheet
of
foolscap
having
covered
the
page
with
writing
he
rose
moved
to
the
and
compared
his
task
with
an
open
letter
that
lay
there
the
comparison
seemed
to
please
him
he
straightened
his
shoulders
and
threw
back
his
head
in
an
attitude
of
critical
satisfaction
so
absorbed
was
he
that
when
a
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
outside
he
did
not
notice
it
and
only
raised
his
head
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
unceremoniously
even
then
his
interest
was
momentary
hullo
he
said
his
eyes
returning
to
their
scrutiny
of
his
task
chilcote
shut
the
door
and
came
hastily
across
the
room
he
looked
ill
and
harassed
as
he
reached
loder
he
put
out
his
hand
nervously
and
touched
his
arm
loder
looked
up
what
is
it
he
asked
any
new
development
chilcote
tried
to
smile
yes
he
said
huskily
it
loder
freed
his
arm
what
the
end
of
the
world
no
the
end
of
the
words
came
jerkily
the
strain
that
had
enforced
them
showing
in
every
syllable
still
loder
was
uncomprehending
he
could
not
or
would
not
understand
again
chilcote
caught
and
jerked
at
his
sleeve
do
you
see
you
see
chilcote
dropped
the
sleeve
and
passed
his
handkerchief
across
his
forehead
it
come
he
repeated
do
you
understand
i
want
he
drew
away
then
stepped
back
again
anxiously
i
know
i
taking
you
unawares
he
said
but
it
not
my
fault
on
my
soul
it
not
the
thing
seems
to
spring
at
me
and
grip
me
he
stopped
sinking
weakly
into
a
chair
for
a
moment
loder
stood
erect
and
immovable
then
almost
with
reluctance
his
glance
turned
to
the
figure
beside
him
you
want
me
to
take
your
place
without
preparation
his
voice
was
distinct
and
firm
but
it
was
free
from
contempt
yes
yes
i
chilcote
spoke
without
looking
up
that
you
may
spend
the
night
in
morphia
this
and
other
nights
chilcote
lifted
a
flushed
unsettled
face
you
have
no
right
to
preach
you
accepted
the
loder
raised
his
head
quickly
i
never
he
began
then
both
his
face
and
voice
altered
you
are
quite
right
he
said
coldly
you
have
to
complain
chilcote
stirred
uncomfortably
my
dear
chap
he
said
i
meant
no
offence
it
merely
your
nerves
i
know
but
come
to
business
what
am
i
to
do
chilcote
rose
excitedly
yes
business
let
come
to
business
rough
on
you
taking
you
short
like
this
but
you
have
an
erratic
person
to
deal
with
i
had
a
horrible
day
a
horrible
his
face
had
paled
again
and
in
the
green
lamplight
it
possessed
a
grayish
hue
involuntarily
loder
turned
away
chilcote
watched
him
as
he
passed
to
the
desk
and
began
mechanically
sorting
papers
a
horrible
day
he
repeated
so
bad
that
i
face
the
night
you
have
read
de
quincey
he
asked
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
then
read
him
again
and
you
understand
i
have
all
the
horrors
without
any
art
i
have
no
of
sorrow
but
i
have
worse
monsters
than
his
he
laughed
unpleasantly
loder
turned
why
in
the
devil
name
he
began
then
again
he
halted
something
in
chilcote
drawn
excited
face
checked
him
the
strange
sense
of
predestination
that
we
sometimes
see
in
the
eyes
of
another
struck
cold
upon
him
chilling
his
last
attempt
at
remonstrance
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
substituted
in
an
ordinary
voice
the
words
steadied
chilcote
he
laughed
a
little
the
laugh
was
still
shaky
but
it
was
pitched
in
a
lower
key
you
you
quite
right
to
pull
me
up
we
have
no
time
to
waste
it
must
be
one
he
pulled
out
his
watch
then
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
down
into
the
shadowy
court
how
quiet
you
are
here
he
said
then
abruptly
anew
thought
struck
him
and
he
wheeled
back
into
the
room
loder
he
said
quickly
loder
i
have
an
idea
while
you
are
me
why
should
i
be
you
why
should
i
be
john
loder
instead
of
the
vagrant
we
contemplated
it
covers
everything
it
explains
everything
it
magnificent
i
amazed
we
never
thought
of
it
loder
was
still
beside
the
desk
i
thought
of
it
he
said
without
looking
back
and
did
suggest
it
why
loder
said
nothing
and
the
other
colored
jealous
of
your
reputation
he
said
satirically
i
have
none
to
be
jealous
chilcote
laughed
disagreeably
then
you
are
so
for
gone
in
philosophy
as
i
thought
you
have
a
niche
in
your
own
good
again
loder
was
silent
then
he
smiled
you
have
an
oddly
correct
perception
at
times
he
said
i
suppose
i
have
had
a
lame
sort
of
pride
in
keeping
my
name
clean
but
pride
like
that
is
out
of
fashion
and
i
got
to
float
with
the
he
laughed
the
short
laugh
that
chilcote
had
heard
once
or
twice
before
and
crossing
the
room
he
stood
beside
his
visitor
after
all
he
said
what
business
have
i
with
pride
straight
or
lame
have
my
identity
if
you
want
it
when
all
defences
have
been
broken
down
one
barrier
wo
save
the
laughing
again
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
other
arm
come
he
said
give
your
orders
i
an
hour
later
the
two
men
passed
from
loder
bed
room
where
the
final
arrangements
had
been
completed
back
into
the
loder
came
first
in
faultless
his
hair
was
carefully
brushed
the
clothes
he
wore
fitted
him
perfectly
to
any
glance
critical
or
casual
he
was
the
man
who
had
mounted
the
stairs
and
entered
the
rooms
earlier
in
the
evening
chilcote
manner
of
walking
and
poise
of
the
head
seemed
to
have
descended
upon
him
with
chilcote
clothes
he
came
into
the
room
hastily
and
passed
to
the
desk
i
have
no
private
papers
he
said
so
i
have
nothing
to
lock
up
everything
can
stand
as
it
is
a
woman
named
robins
comes
in
the
mornings
to
clean
up
and
light
the
fire
otherwise
you
must
shift
for
yourself
nobody
will
disturb
you
quiet
dead
quiet
is
about
the
one
thing
you
can
count
chilcote
half
halting
in
the
doorway
made
an
attempt
to
laugh
of
the
two
he
was
noticeably
the
more
embarrassed
in
loder
tweed
suit
he
felt
stranded
on
his
own
personality
bereft
for
the
moment
of
the
familiar
accessories
that
helped
to
cloak
deficiencies
and
keep
the
wheel
of
conventionality
comfortably
rolling
he
stood
unpleasantly
conscious
of
himself
unable
to
shape
his
sensations
even
in
thought
he
glanced
at
the
fire
at
the
table
finally
at
the
chair
on
which
he
had
thrown
his
overcoat
before
entering
the
bedroom
at
the
sight
of
the
coat
his
gaze
brightened
the
aimlessness
forsook
him
and
he
gave
an
exclamation
of
relief
by
jove
he
said
i
clean
what
loder
looked
round
the
he
crossed
to
the
coat
and
thrust
his
hand
into
the
pocket
the
duplicates
only
arrived
this
afternoon
the
nick
of
time
eh
he
spoke
fast
his
fingers
searching
busily
occupation
of
any
kind
came
as
a
boon
loder
slowly
followed
him
and
as
the
box
was
brought
to
light
he
leaned
forward
interestedly
as
i
told
you
one
is
the
copy
of
an
old
the
other
a
plain
band
a
plain
gold
band
like
a
chilcote
laughed
as
he
placed
the
four
rings
side
by
side
on
his
palm
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
that
would
be
wide
and
not
ostentatious
you
know
how
i
detest
loder
touched
the
rings
you
have
good
taste
he
said
let
see
if
they
serve
their
purpose
he
picked
them
up
and
carried
them
to
the
lamp
chilcote
followed
him
that
was
an
ugly
wound
he
said
his
curiosity
reawakening
as
loder
extended
his
finger
how
did
you
come
by
it
the
other
smiled
it
a
memento
he
said
of
bravery
no
quite
the
he
looked
again
at
his
hand
then
glanced
back
at
chilcote
no
he
repeated
with
an
unusual
impulse
of
confidence
it
serves
to
remind
me
that
i
am
not
exempt
that
i
have
been
fooled
like
other
that
implies
a
woman
again
loder
looked
at
the
scar
on
his
finger
i
seldom
recall
the
thing
it
so
absolutely
past
but
i
rather
like
to
remember
it
i
rather
want
you
to
know
that
i
been
through
the
fire
it
a
sort
of
chilcote
made
a
hasty
gesture
but
the
other
interrupted
it
oh
i
know
you
trust
me
but
you
giving
me
a
risky
post
i
want
you
to
see
that
women
are
out
of
my
line
quite
out
of
but
my
dear
chap
loder
went
on
without
heeding
this
thing
happened
eight
years
ago
at
santasalare
he
said
a
little
place
between
luna
and
pistoria
a
mere
handful
of
houses
wedged
between
two
hills
a
regular
relic
of
old
italy
crumbling
away
under
flowers
and
sunshine
with
nothing
to
suggest
the
present
century
except
the
occasional
passing
of
a
train
round
the
base
of
one
of
the
hills
i
had
literally
stumbled
upon
the
place
on
a
long
tramp
south
from
switzerland
and
had
been
tempted
into
a
stay
at
the
little
inn
the
night
after
my
arrival
something
unusual
occurred
there
was
an
accident
to
the
train
at
the
point
where
it
skirted
the
village
there
was
a
small
excitement
all
the
inhabitants
were
anxious
to
help
and
i
took
my
share
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
smash
was
not
disastrous
the
passengers
were
hurt
and
frightened
but
nobody
was
he
paused
and
looked
at
his
companion
but
seeing
him
interested
went
on
among
these
passengers
was
an
english
lady
of
all
concerned
in
the
business
she
was
the
least
upset
when
i
came
upon
her
she
was
sitting
on
the
shattered
door
of
one
of
the
carriages
calmly
rearranging
her
hat
on
seeing
me
she
looked
up
with
the
most
charming
smile
imaginable
have
just
been
waiting
for
somebody
like
you
she
said
stupid
maid
has
got
herself
smashed
up
somewhere
in
the
carriages
and
i
have
nobody
to
help
me
to
find
my
dog
of
course
that
first
speech
ought
to
have
enlightened
me
but
it
did
i
only
saw
the
smile
and
heard
the
voice
i
knew
nothing
of
whether
they
were
deep
or
shallow
so
i
found
the
maid
and
found
the
dog
the
first
expressed
gratitude
the
other
did
i
extricated
him
with
enormous
difficulty
from
the
wreck
of
the
and
this
was
how
he
marked
his
he
held
out
his
hand
and
nodded
towards
the
scar
chilcote
glanced
up
so
that
the
explanation
yes
i
tried
to
conceal
the
thing
when
i
restored
the
dog
but
i
was
bleeding
abominably
and
i
failed
then
the
whole
business
was
changed
it
was
i
who
needed
seeing
to
my
new
friend
insisted
i
who
should
be
looked
after
and
not
she
she
forgot
the
dog
in
the
newer
interest
of
my
wounded
finger
the
maid
who
was
practically
unhurt
was
sent
on
to
engage
rooms
at
the
little
inn
and
she
and
i
followed
slowly
that
walk
impressed
me
there
was
an
attractive
mistiness
of
atmosphere
in
the
warm
night
a
sensation
more
than
attractive
in
being
made
much
of
by
a
woman
of
one
own
class
and
country
after
five
he
laughed
with
a
touch
of
irony
but
i
wo
take
up
your
time
with
details
you
know
the
progress
of
an
ordinary
love
affair
throw
in
a
few
more
flowers
and
a
little
more
sunshine
than
is
usual
a
man
who
is
practically
a
hermit
and
a
woman
who
knows
the
world
by
heart
and
you
have
the
whole
thing
she
insisted
on
staying
in
santasalare
for
three
days
in
order
to
keep
my
finger
bandaged
she
ended
by
staying
three
weeks
in
the
hope
of
smashing
up
my
life
on
coming
to
the
hotel
she
had
given
no
name
and
in
our
first
explanations
to
each
other
she
led
me
to
conclude
her
an
unmarried
girl
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
three
weeks
that
i
learned
that
she
was
not
a
free
agent
as
i
had
innocently
imagined
but
possessed
a
husband
whom
she
had
left
ill
with
malaria
at
florence
or
rome
the
news
disconcerted
me
and
i
took
no
pains
to
hide
it
after
that
the
end
came
abruptly
in
her
eyes
i
had
become
a
fool
with
principles
in
my
eyes
but
there
is
no
need
for
that
she
left
santasalare
the
same
night
in
a
great
confusion
of
trunks
and
and
next
morning
i
strapped
on
my
knapsack
and
turned
my
face
to
the
and
women
do
count
ever
after
chilcote
smiled
beguiled
out
of
himself
loder
laughed
that
what
i
been
trying
to
convey
once
bitten
twice
shy
he
laughed
again
and
slipped
the
two
rings
over
his
finger
with
an
air
of
finality
now
shall
i
start
this
is
the
he
drew
a
key
from
the
pocket
of
chilcote
when
i
get
to
grosvenor
square
i
am
to
find
your
house
go
straight
in
mount
the
stairs
and
there
on
my
right
hand
will
be
the
door
of
your
i
mean
my
own
private
rooms
i
think
i
got
it
all
by
heart
i
feel
inspired
i
feel
that
i
ca
go
he
handed
the
two
remaining
rings
to
chilcote
and
picked
up
the
overcoat
i
stick
on
till
i
get
a
wire
he
said
then
i
come
back
and
we
reverse
he
slipped
on
the
coat
and
moved
back
towards
the
table
now
that
the
decisive
moment
had
come
it
embarrassed
him
scarcely
knowing
how
to
bring
it
to
an
end
he
held
out
his
hand
chilcote
took
it
paling
a
little
be
all
right
he
said
with
a
sudden
return
of
nervousness
be
all
right
and
i
made
it
plain
about
about
the
remuneration
a
hundred
a
week
besides
all
loder
smiled
again
my
pay
oh
yes
you
made
it
clear
as
day
shall
we
say
now
yes
there
was
a
strange
distant
note
in
chilcote
voice
but
the
other
did
not
pretend
to
hear
it
he
pressed
the
hand
he
was
holding
though
the
cold
dampness
of
it
repelled
him
he
said
again
they
stood
for
a
moment
awkwardly
looking
at
each
other
then
loder
quietly
disengaged
his
hand
crossed
the
room
and
passed
through
the
door
chilcote
left
standing
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
room
listened
while
the
last
sound
of
the
other
footsteps
was
audible
on
the
uncarpeted
stairs
then
with
a
furtive
hurried
gesture
he
caught
up
the
lamp
and
passed
into
loder
bedroom
viii
to
all
men
come
portentous
moments
difficult
moments
triumphant
moments
loder
had
had
his
examples
of
all
three
but
no
moment
in
his
career
ever
equalled
in
strangeness
of
sensation
that
in
which
dressed
in
another
man
clothes
he
fitted
the
latchkey
for
the
first
time
into
the
door
of
the
other
man
house
the
act
was
quietly
done
the
key
fitted
the
lock
smoothly
and
his
fingers
turned
it
without
hesitation
though
his
heart
usually
extremely
steady
beat
sharply
for
a
second
the
hall
loomed
massive
and
sombre
despite
the
modernity
of
electric
lights
it
was
darkly
and
expensively
decorated
in
black
and
brown
a
frieze
of
wrought
bronze
representing
peacocks
with
outspread
tails
ornamented
the
walls
the
banisters
were
of
heavy
and
the
somewhat
formidable
fireplace
was
of
the
same
dark
metal
loder
looked
about
him
then
advanced
his
heart
again
beating
quickly
as
his
hand
touched
the
cold
banister
and
he
began
his
ascent
of
the
stairs
but
at
each
step
his
confidence
strengthened
his
feet
became
more
firm
until
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
as
if
to
disprove
his
assurance
his
pulses
played
him
false
once
more
this
time
to
a
more
serious
tune
from
the
farther
end
of
a
corridor
a
maid
was
coming
straight
in
his
direction
for
one
short
second
all
things
seemed
to
whiz
about
him
the
certainty
of
detection
overpowered
his
mind
the
indisputable
knowledge
that
he
was
john
loder
and
no
other
despite
all
armor
of
effrontery
and
dress
so
dominated
him
that
all
other
considerations
shrank
before
it
it
wanted
but
one
word
one
simple
word
of
denunciation
and
the
whole
scheme
was
shattered
in
the
dismay
of
the
moment
he
almost
wished
that
the
word
might
be
spoken
and
the
suspense
ended
but
the
maid
came
on
in
silence
and
so
incredible
was
the
silence
that
loder
moved
onward
too
he
came
within
a
yard
of
her
and
still
she
did
not
speak
then
as
he
passed
her
she
drew
back
respectfully
against
the
wall
the
strain
so
astonishingly
short
had
been
immense
but
with
its
slackening
came
a
strong
reaction
the
expected
humiliation
seethed
suddenly
to
a
desire
to
dare
fate
pausing
quickly
he
turned
and
called
the
woman
back
the
spot
where
he
had
halted
was
vividly
bright
the
ceiling
light
being
directly
above
his
head
and
as
she
came
towards
him
he
raised
his
face
deliberately
she
looked
at
him
without
surprise
or
interest
yes
sir
she
said
is
your
mistress
in
he
asked
he
could
think
of
no
other
question
but
it
served
his
purpose
as
a
test
of
his
voice
still
the
woman
showed
no
surprise
she
not
in
sir
she
answered
but
she
expected
in
half
an
in
half
an
hour
all
right
that
all
i
with
a
movement
of
decision
loder
walked
back
to
the
turned
to
the
right
and
opened
the
door
of
chilcote
rooms
the
door
opened
on
a
short
wide
passage
on
one
side
stood
the
study
on
the
other
the
bed
bath
and
with
a
blind
sense
of
knowledge
and
unfamiliarity
bred
of
much
description
on
part
he
put
his
hand
on
the
study
door
and
still
exalted
by
the
omen
of
his
first
success
turned
the
handle
inside
the
room
there
was
firelight
and
lamplight
and
a
studious
air
of
peace
the
realization
of
this
and
a
slow
incredulity
at
voluntary
renunciation
were
his
first
impressions
then
his
attention
was
needed
for
more
imminent
things
as
he
entered
the
new
secretary
was
returning
a
volume
to
its
place
on
the
at
sight
of
him
he
pushed
it
hastily
into
position
and
turned
round
i
was
making
a
few
notes
on
the
political
position
of
khorasan
he
said
glancing
with
slight
apprehensiveness
at
the
other
face
he
was
a
small
shy
man
with
few
social
attainments
but
an
extraordinary
amount
of
learning
the
antithesis
of
the
alert
blessington
whom
he
had
replaced
loder
bore
his
scrutiny
without
flinching
indeed
it
struck
him
suddenly
that
there
was
a
fund
of
interest
almost
of
excitement
in
the
encountering
of
each
new
pair
of
eyes
at
the
thought
he
moved
forward
to
the
desk
thank
you
greening
he
said
a
very
useful
bit
of
the
secretary
glanced
up
slightly
puzzled
his
endurance
had
been
severely
taxed
in
the
fourteen
days
that
he
had
filled
his
new
post
i
glad
you
think
so
sir
he
said
hesitatingly
you
rather
the
matter
this
morning
if
you
loder
was
taking
off
his
coat
but
stopped
in
the
operation
this
morning
he
said
oh
did
i
did
i
then
struck
by
the
opportunity
the
words
gave
him
he
turned
towards
the
secretary
got
to
get
used
to
me
greening
he
said
you
have
quite
grasped
me
yet
i
can
see
i
a
man
of
moods
you
know
up
to
the
present
seen
my
slack
side
my
jarred
side
but
i
have
quite
another
when
i
care
to
show
it
i
a
sort
of
again
he
laughed
and
greening
echoed
the
sound
diffidently
chilcote
had
evidently
discouraged
familiarity
loder
eyed
him
with
abrupt
understanding
he
recognized
the
loneliness
in
the
anxious
conciliatory
manner
you
tired
he
said
kindly
go
to
bed
i
got
some
thinking
to
do
he
held
out
his
hand
greening
took
it
still
half
distrustful
of
this
fresh
side
to
so
complex
a
man
sir
he
said
if
you
approve
i
shall
go
on
with
my
notes
i
hope
you
will
have
a
restful
for
a
second
loder
eyebrows
went
up
but
he
recovered
himself
instantly
ah
thanks
greening
he
said
thanks
i
think
your
hope
will
be
he
watched
the
little
secretary
move
softly
and
apologetically
to
the
door
then
he
walked
to
the
fire
and
resting
his
elbows
on
the
he
took
his
face
in
his
hands
for
a
space
he
stood
absolutely
quiet
then
his
hands
dropped
to
his
sides
and
he
turned
slowly
round
in
that
short
space
he
had
balanced
things
and
found
his
bearings
the
slight
nervousness
shown
in
his
brusque
sentences
and
overconfident
manner
faded
out
and
he
faced
facts
steadily
with
the
return
of
his
calmness
he
took
a
long
survey
of
the
room
his
glance
brightened
appreciatively
as
it
travelled
from
the
walls
lined
with
books
to
the
lamps
modulated
to
the
proper
light
from
the
lamps
to
the
desk
fitted
with
every
requirement
nothing
was
lacking
all
he
had
once
possessed
all
he
had
since
dreamed
of
was
here
but
on
a
greater
scale
to
enjoy
the
luxuries
of
life
a
man
must
go
long
without
them
loder
had
lived
severely
so
severely
that
until
three
weeks
ago
he
had
believed
himself
exempt
from
the
temptations
of
humanity
then
the
voice
of
the
world
had
spoken
and
within
him
another
voice
had
answered
with
a
tone
so
clamorous
and
insistent
that
it
had
outcried
his
surprised
and
incredulous
wonder
at
its
existence
and
its
claims
that
had
been
the
voice
of
suppressed
ambition
and
now
as
he
stood
in
the
new
atmosphere
a
newer
voice
lifted
itself
the
joy
of
material
things
rose
suddenly
overbalancing
the
last
remnant
of
the
philosophy
he
had
reared
he
saw
all
things
in
a
fresh
light
the
soft
carpets
the
soft
lights
the
numberless
pleasant
unnecessary
things
that
color
the
passing
landscape
and
oil
the
wheels
of
life
this
was
power
power
made
manifest
the
choice
bindings
of
one
books
the
quiet
harmony
of
one
surroundings
the
gratifying
deference
of
dependants
these
were
the
visible
the
outward
signs
the
things
he
had
forgotten
crossing
the
room
slowly
he
lifted
and
looked
at
the
different
papers
on
the
desk
they
had
a
substantial
feeling
an
importance
an
air
of
value
they
were
like
the
solemn
keys
to
so
many
vexed
problems
beside
the
papers
were
a
heap
of
letters
neatly
arranged
and
as
yet
unopened
he
turned
them
over
one
by
one
they
were
all
thick
and
interesting
to
look
at
he
smiled
as
he
recalled
his
own
scanty
mail
envelopes
long
and
bulky
or
narrow
and
thin
unwelcome
manuscripts
or
very
welcome
checks
having
sorted
the
letters
he
hesitated
it
was
his
task
to
open
them
but
he
had
never
in
his
life
opened
an
envelope
addressed
to
another
man
he
stood
uncertain
weighing
them
in
his
hand
then
all
at
once
a
look
of
attention
and
surprise
crossed
his
face
and
he
raised
his
head
some
one
had
unmistakably
paused
outside
the
door
which
greening
had
left
ajar
there
was
a
moment
of
apparent
doubt
then
a
stir
of
skirts
a
quick
uncertain
knock
and
the
intruder
entered
for
a
couple
of
seconds
she
stood
in
the
doorway
then
as
loder
made
no
effort
to
speak
she
moved
into
the
room
she
had
apparently
but
just
returned
from
some
entertainment
for
though
she
had
drawn
off
her
long
gloves
she
was
still
wearing
an
evening
cloak
of
lace
and
fur
that
she
was
chilcote
wife
loder
instinctively
realized
the
moment
she
entered
the
room
but
a
disconcerting
confusion
of
ideas
was
all
that
followed
the
knowledge
he
stood
by
the
desk
silent
and
awkward
trying
to
fit
his
expectations
to
his
knowledge
then
faced
by
the
hopelessness
of
the
task
he
turned
abruptly
and
looked
at
her
again
she
had
taken
off
her
cloak
and
was
standing
by
the
fire
the
compulsion
of
moving
through
life
alone
had
set
its
seal
upon
her
in
a
certain
a
certain
confidence
of
pose
yet
her
figure
as
loder
then
saw
it
backgrounded
by
the
dark
books
and
gowned
in
pale
blue
had
a
suggestion
of
youthfulness
that
seemed
a
contradiction
the
remembrance
of
chilcote
epithets
cold
and
unsympathetic
came
back
to
him
with
something
like
astonishment
he
felt
no
uncertainty
no
dread
of
discovery
and
humiliation
in
her
presence
as
he
had
felt
in
the
maid
yet
there
was
something
in
her
face
that
made
him
infinitely
more
uncomfortable
a
look
he
could
find
no
name
for
a
friendliness
that
studiously
covered
another
feeling
whether
question
distrust
or
actual
dislike
he
could
not
say
with
a
strange
sensation
of
awkwardness
he
sorted
chilcote
letters
waiting
for
her
to
speak
as
if
divining
his
thought
she
turned
towards
him
i
afraid
i
rather
intrude
she
said
if
you
are
busy
his
sense
of
courtesy
was
touched
he
had
begun
life
with
a
high
opinion
of
women
and
the
words
shook
up
an
echo
of
the
old
sentiment
do
think
that
he
said
hastily
i
was
only
looking
through
my
letters
you
must
rate
yourself
below
he
was
conscious
that
his
tone
was
hurried
that
his
words
were
a
little
jagged
but
eve
did
not
appear
to
notice
unlike
greening
she
took
the
new
manner
without
surprise
she
had
known
chilcote
for
six
years
i
dined
with
the
fraides
she
said
mr
fraide
sent
you
a
unconsciously
loder
smiled
there
was
humor
in
the
thought
of
a
message
to
him
from
the
great
fraide
to
hide
his
amusement
he
wheeled
one
of
the
big
forward
indeed
he
said
wo
you
sit
down
they
were
near
together
now
and
he
saw
her
face
more
fully
again
he
was
taken
aback
chilcote
had
spoken
of
her
as
successful
and
intelligent
but
never
as
beautiful
yet
her
beauty
was
a
rare
and
uncommon
fact
her
hair
was
black
not
a
glossy
black
but
the
dusky
black
that
is
softer
than
any
brown
her
eyes
were
large
and
of
a
peculiarly
pure
blue
and
her
eyelashes
were
black
beautifully
curved
and
of
remarkable
thickness
wo
you
sit
down
he
said
again
cutting
short
his
thoughts
with
some
confusion
thank
she
gravely
accepted
the
proffered
chair
but
he
saw
that
without
any
ostentation
she
drew
her
skirts
aside
as
she
passed
him
the
action
displeased
him
unaccountably
well
he
said
shortly
what
had
fraide
to
say
he
walked
to
the
with
his
customary
movement
and
stood
watching
her
the
instinct
towards
hiding
his
face
had
left
him
her
instant
and
uninterested
acceptance
of
him
almost
nettled
him
his
own
impression
of
chilcote
came
to
him
unpleasantly
and
with
it
the
first
desire
to
assert
his
own
individuality
stung
by
the
conflicting
emotions
he
felt
in
chilcote
pockets
for
something
to
smoke
eve
saw
and
interpreted
the
action
are
these
your
cigarettes
she
leaned
towards
a
small
table
and
took
up
a
box
made
of
he
took
the
box
from
her
and
as
it
passed
from
one
to
the
other
he
saw
her
glance
at
his
rings
the
glance
was
momentary
her
lips
parted
to
express
question
or
surprise
then
closed
again
without
comment
more
than
any
spoken
words
the
incident
showed
him
the
gulf
that
separated
husband
and
wife
well
he
said
again
what
about
fraide
at
his
words
she
sat
straighter
and
looked
at
him
more
directly
as
if
bracing
herself
to
a
task
mr
fraide
is
is
as
interested
as
ever
in
you
she
began
or
in
you
loder
made
the
interruption
precisely
as
he
felt
chilcote
would
have
made
it
then
instantly
he
wished
the
words
back
eve
warm
skin
colored
more
deeply
for
a
second
the
inscrutable
underlying
expression
that
puzzled
him
showed
in
her
eyes
then
she
sank
back
into
a
corner
of
the
chair
why
do
you
make
such
a
point
of
sneering
at
my
friends
she
asked
quietly
i
overlook
it
when
you
are
she
halted
slightly
on
the
word
but
you
are
not
nervous
loder
to
his
great
humiliation
reddened
except
for
an
occasional
outburst
on
the
part
of
robins
his
charwoman
he
had
not
merited
a
woman
displeasure
for
years
the
sneer
was
unintentional
he
said
for
the
first
time
eve
showed
a
personal
interest
she
looked
at
him
in
a
puzzled
way
if
your
apology
was
meant
she
said
hesitatingly
i
should
be
glad
to
accept
loder
uncertain
of
how
to
take
the
words
moved
back
to
the
desk
he
carried
an
unlighted
cigarette
between
his
fingers
there
was
an
interval
in
which
neither
spoke
then
at
last
conscious
of
its
awkwardness
eve
rose
with
one
hand
on
the
back
of
her
chair
she
looked
at
him
mr
fraide
thinks
it
such
a
pity
that
she
stopped
to
choose
her
words
that
you
should
lose
hold
on
things
lose
interest
in
things
as
you
are
doing
he
has
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
you
in
the
last
three
weeks
ever
since
the
day
of
your
your
illness
in
the
house
and
it
seems
to
him
again
she
broke
off
watching
loder
averted
head
it
seems
to
him
that
if
you
made
one
real
effort
now
even
now
to
shake
off
your
restlessness
that
your
your
health
might
improve
he
thinks
that
the
present
crisis
would
be
she
hesitated
would
give
you
a
tremendous
opportunity
your
trade
interests
bound
up
as
they
are
with
persia
would
give
any
opinion
you
might
hold
a
double
almost
unconsciously
a
touch
of
warmth
crept
into
her
words
mr
fraide
talked
very
seriously
about
the
beginning
of
your
career
he
said
that
if
only
the
spirit
of
your
first
days
could
come
back
her
tone
grew
quicker
as
though
she
feared
ridicule
in
loder
silence
he
asked
me
to
use
my
influence
i
know
that
i
have
little
none
perhaps
but
i
could
tell
him
that
and
so
so
i
and
have
kept
the
promise
loder
spoke
at
random
her
manner
and
her
words
had
both
affected
him
there
was
a
sensation
of
unreality
in
his
brain
yes
she
answered
i
always
want
to
do
what
i
as
she
spoke
a
sudden
realization
of
the
effort
she
was
making
struck
upon
him
and
with
it
his
scorn
of
chilcote
rose
in
renewed
force
my
intention
he
began
turning
to
her
then
the
futility
of
any
declaration
silenced
him
i
shall
think
over
what
you
say
he
added
after
a
minute
wait
i
suppose
i
ca
say
more
than
their
eyes
met
and
she
smiled
a
little
i
do
believe
i
expected
as
much
she
said
i
think
i
go
now
you
have
been
wonderfully
again
she
smiled
slightly
at
the
same
time
extending
her
hand
the
gesture
was
quite
friendly
but
in
loder
eyes
it
held
relief
as
well
as
friendliness
and
when
their
hands
met
he
noticed
that
her
fingers
barely
brushed
his
he
picked
up
her
cloak
and
carried
it
across
the
room
as
he
held
the
door
open
he
laid
it
quietly
across
her
arm
i
think
over
what
you
said
he
repeated
again
she
glanced
at
him
as
if
suspecting
sarcasm
then
partly
reassured
she
paused
you
will
always
despise
your
opportunities
and
i
suppose
i
shall
always
envy
them
she
said
that
the
way
with
men
and
women
with
another
faint
smile
she
passed
out
into
the
corridor
loder
waited
until
he
heard
the
outer
door
close
then
he
crossed
the
room
thoughtfully
and
dropped
into
the
chair
that
she
had
vacated
he
sat
for
a
time
looking
at
the
hand
her
fingers
had
touched
then
he
lifted
his
head
with
a
characteristic
movement
by
jove
he
said
aloud
how
cordially
she
detests
tests
him
ix
loder
slept
soundly
and
dreamlessly
in
chilcote
canopied
bed
to
him
the
big
room
with
its
severe
magnificence
suggested
nothing
of
the
gloom
and
solitude
that
it
held
in
its
owner
eyes
the
ponderous
furniture
the
high
ceiling
the
heavy
curtains
unchanged
since
the
days
of
chilcote
grandfather
all
hinted
at
a
ownership
that
stirred
him
the
ownership
was
mythical
in
his
regard
and
the
possessions
a
mirage
but
they
filled
the
day
and
surely
sufficient
for
the
day
that
was
his
frame
of
mind
as
he
opened
his
eyes
on
the
following
morning
and
lay
appreciative
of
his
comfort
of
the
surrounding
space
even
of
the
light
that
filtered
through
the
curtain
chinks
suggestive
of
a
world
recreated
with
day
all
things
seem
possible
to
a
healthy
man
he
stretched
his
arms
luxuriously
delighting
in
the
glossy
smoothness
of
the
sheets
what
was
it
chilcote
had
said
better
live
for
a
day
than
exist
for
a
lifetime
that
was
true
and
life
had
begun
at
he
was
to
know
it
for
the
first
time
he
smiled
but
without
irony
man
is
at
his
best
at
he
mused
he
has
retained
his
enthusiasms
and
shed
his
exuberances
he
has
learned
what
to
pick
up
and
what
to
pass
by
he
no
longer
imagines
that
to
drain
a
cup
one
must
taste
the
dregs
he
closed
his
eyes
and
stretched
again
not
his
arms
only
but
his
whole
body
the
pleasure
of
his
mental
state
insisted
on
a
physical
expression
then
sitting
up
in
bed
he
pressed
the
electric
bell
chilcote
new
valet
responded
pull
those
curtains
renwick
he
said
what
the
time
he
had
passed
the
ordeal
of
renwick
eyes
the
night
before
the
man
was
slow
even
a
little
stupid
he
drew
back
the
curtains
carefully
then
looked
at
the
small
clock
on
the
eight
sir
i
did
expect
the
bell
so
early
loder
felt
reproved
and
a
pause
followed
may
i
bring
your
cup
of
tea
sir
no
not
just
yet
i
have
a
bath
renwick
showed
ponderous
uncertainty
warm
sir
he
hazarded
no
still
perplexed
the
man
left
the
room
loder
smiled
to
himself
the
chances
of
discovery
in
that
quarter
were
not
large
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
chilcote
had
even
overstepped
necessity
in
the
matter
of
his
valet
dullness
he
breakfasted
alone
following
chilcote
habit
and
after
breakfast
found
his
way
to
the
study
as
he
entered
greening
rose
with
the
same
conciliatory
haste
that
he
had
shown
the
night
before
loder
nodded
to
him
early
at
work
he
said
pleasantly
the
little
man
showed
instant
almost
ridiculous
relief
sir
he
said
you
too
are
early
i
rather
feared
your
nerves
troubled
you
after
i
left
last
night
for
i
found
your
letters
still
unopened
this
morning
but
i
am
glad
to
see
you
look
so
loder
promptly
turned
his
back
to
the
light
oh
last
night
letters
he
said
to
tell
you
the
truth
greening
my
wife
his
hesitation
was
very
slight
my
wife
looked
me
up
after
you
left
and
we
gossiped
i
clean
forgot
the
he
smiled
in
an
explanatory
way
as
he
moved
to
the
desk
and
picked
up
the
letters
with
greening
eyes
upon
him
there
was
no
time
for
scruples
with
very
creditable
coolness
he
began
opening
the
envelopes
one
by
one
the
letters
were
unimportant
and
he
passed
them
one
after
another
to
the
secretary
experiencing
a
slight
thrill
of
authority
as
each
left
his
hand
again
the
fact
that
power
is
visible
in
little
things
came
to
his
mind
give
me
my
greening
he
said
when
the
letters
had
been
disposed
of
the
book
that
greening
handed
him
was
neat
in
shape
and
bound
like
chilcote
in
as
loder
took
it
the
gold
monogram
winked
at
him
in
the
bright
morning
light
the
incident
moved
his
sense
of
humor
he
and
the
book
were
cooperators
in
the
fraud
it
seemed
he
felt
an
inclination
to
wink
back
nevertheless
he
opened
it
with
proper
gravity
and
skimmed
the
pages
the
page
devoted
to
the
day
was
almost
full
on
every
other
line
were
jottings
in
chilcote
irregular
hand
and
twice
among
the
entries
appeared
a
prominent
cross
in
blue
pencilling
loder
interest
quickened
as
his
eye
caught
the
mark
it
had
been
agreed
between
them
that
only
engagements
essential
to
chilcote
public
life
need
be
carried
through
during
his
absence
and
these
to
save
confusion
were
to
be
crossed
in
blue
pencil
the
rest
for
the
most
part
social
claims
were
to
be
left
to
circumstance
and
loder
inclination
erratic
memory
always
accounting
for
the
breaking
of
trivial
promises
but
loder
in
his
new
energy
was
anxious
for
obligations
the
desire
for
fresh
and
greater
tests
grew
with
indulgence
he
scanned
the
two
lines
with
eagerness
the
first
was
an
interview
with
cresham
one
of
chilcote
supporters
in
wark
the
other
an
engagement
to
lunch
with
fraide
at
the
idea
of
the
former
his
interest
quickened
but
at
thought
of
the
latter
it
quailed
momentarily
had
the
entry
been
a
royal
command
it
would
have
affected
him
infinitely
less
for
a
space
his
assurance
faltered
then
by
coincidence
the
recollection
of
eve
and
eve
words
of
last
night
came
back
to
him
and
his
mind
was
filled
with
a
new
sensation
because
of
chilcote
he
was
despised
by
chilcote
wife
there
was
no
denying
that
in
all
the
pleasant
excitement
of
the
adventure
that
knowledge
had
rankled
it
came
to
him
now
linked
with
remembrance
of
the
slight
reluctant
touch
of
her
fingers
the
faintly
evasive
dislike
underlying
her
glance
it
was
a
trivial
thing
but
it
touched
his
pride
as
a
man
that
was
how
he
put
it
to
himself
it
was
that
he
valued
this
woman
opinion
any
woman
opinion
it
was
merely
that
it
touched
his
pride
he
turned
again
to
the
window
and
gazed
out
the
engagement
book
still
between
his
hands
what
if
he
compelled
her
respect
what
if
by
his
own
personality
cloaked
under
chilcote
identity
he
forced
her
to
admit
his
capability
it
was
a
matter
of
pride
after
all
scarcely
even
of
pride
was
a
better
word
satisfied
by
his
own
reasoning
he
turned
back
into
the
room
see
to
those
letters
greening
he
said
and
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
work
you
might
go
on
with
your
khorasan
notes
i
believe
all
want
every
inch
of
knowledge
we
can
get
in
that
quarter
before
much
older
i
see
you
again
with
a
reassuring
nod
he
crossed
the
room
and
passed
through
the
door
he
lunched
with
fraide
at
his
club
and
afterwards
walked
with
him
to
westminster
the
walk
and
lunch
were
both
memorable
in
that
hour
he
learned
many
things
that
had
been
sealed
to
him
before
he
tasted
his
first
draught
of
real
elation
his
first
drop
of
real
discomfiture
he
saw
for
the
first
time
how
a
great
man
may
condescend
how
unostentatiously
how
fully
how
delightfully
he
felt
what
tact
and
kindness
perfectly
combined
may
accomplish
and
he
burned
inwardly
with
a
sense
of
duplicity
that
crushed
and
elated
him
alternately
he
was
john
loder
friendless
penniless
with
no
present
and
no
future
yet
he
walked
down
whitehall
in
the
full
light
of
day
with
one
of
the
greatest
statesmen
england
has
known
some
strangers
were
being
shown
over
the
terrace
when
he
and
fraide
reached
the
house
and
noticing
the
open
door
the
old
man
paused
i
never
refuse
fresh
air
he
said
shall
we
take
another
breath
of
it
before
settling
down
he
took
loder
arm
and
drew
him
forward
as
they
passed
through
the
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
tightened
i
shall
reckon
among
my
pleasantest
memories
chilcote
he
said
gravely
i
ca
explain
the
feeling
but
i
seem
to
have
touched
husband
the
real
you
more
closely
this
morning
than
i
ever
did
before
it
has
been
a
genuine
he
looked
up
with
the
eyes
that
through
all
his
years
of
action
and
responsibility
had
remained
so
bright
but
loder
paled
suddenly
and
his
glance
turned
to
the
mysterious
secret
unconsciously
fraide
had
stripped
the
illusion
it
was
not
john
loder
who
walked
here
it
was
chilcote
chilcote
with
his
position
his
constituency
his
wife
he
half
extricated
his
arm
but
fraide
held
it
no
he
said
do
draw
away
from
me
you
have
always
been
too
ready
to
do
that
it
is
not
often
i
have
a
pleasant
truth
to
tell
i
wo
be
deprived
of
the
can
the
truth
ever
be
pleasant
sir
involuntarily
loder
echoed
chilcote
fraide
looked
up
he
was
half
a
head
shorter
than
his
companion
though
his
dignity
concealed
the
fact
chilcote
he
said
seriously
give
up
cynicism
it
is
the
of
failure
and
i
do
not
like
it
in
my
loder
said
nothing
the
quiet
insight
of
the
reproof
its
mitigating
kindness
touched
him
sharply
in
that
moment
he
saw
the
rails
down
which
he
had
sent
his
little
car
of
existence
spinning
and
the
sight
daunted
him
the
track
was
steeper
the
gauge
narrower
than
he
had
guessed
there
were
curves
and
sidings
upon
which
he
had
not
reckoned
he
turned
his
head
and
met
fraide
glance
do
count
too
much
on
me
sir
he
said
slowly
i
might
disappoint
you
his
voice
broke
off
on
the
last
word
for
the
sound
of
other
voices
and
of
laughter
came
to
them
across
the
terrace
as
a
group
of
two
women
and
three
men
passed
through
the
open
door
at
a
glance
he
realized
that
the
slighter
of
the
two
women
was
eve
seeing
them
she
disengaged
herself
from
her
party
and
came
quickly
forward
he
saw
her
cheeks
flush
and
her
eyes
brighten
pleasantly
as
they
rested
on
his
companion
but
he
noticed
also
that
after
her
first
cursory
glance
she
avoided
his
own
direction
as
she
came
towards
them
fraide
drew
away
his
hand
in
readiness
to
greet
her
here
comes
my
godchild
he
said
i
often
wish
chilcote
that
i
could
do
away
with
the
he
added
the
last
words
in
an
undertone
as
he
reached
them
then
he
responded
warmly
to
her
smile
what
he
said
turning
the
terrace
into
the
garden
of
eden
in
january
we
can
not
allow
eve
laughed
blame
lady
sarah
she
said
we
met
at
lunch
and
she
carried
me
off
needless
to
say
i
had
to
ask
they
both
laughed
and
loder
joined
a
little
uncertainly
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
the
devotion
of
fraide
and
his
wife
was
a
jest
in
their
particular
set
at
the
sound
of
his
tardy
laugh
eve
turned
to
him
i
hope
i
did
rob
you
of
all
sleep
last
night
she
said
i
caught
him
in
his
den
she
explained
turning
to
fraide
and
invaded
it
most
courageously
i
believe
we
talked
till
again
loder
noticed
bow
quickly
she
looked
from
him
to
fraide
the
knowledge
roused
his
i
had
an
excellent
night
he
said
do
i
look
as
if
i
had
slept
somewhat
slowly
and
reluctantly
eve
looked
back
no
she
said
truthfully
and
with
a
faint
surprise
that
to
loder
seemed
the
first
genuine
emotion
she
had
shown
regarding
him
no
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
you
look
so
she
was
quite
unconscious
and
very
charming
as
she
made
the
admission
it
struck
loder
that
her
coloring
of
hair
and
eyes
gained
by
daylight
were
brightened
and
vivified
by
their
setting
of
sombre
river
and
sombre
stone
fraide
smiled
at
her
affectionately
then
looked
at
loder
chilcote
has
got
anew
lease
of
nerves
eve
he
said
quietly
and
i
believe
i
have
got
a
new
henchman
but
i
see
my
wife
beckoning
to
me
i
must
have
a
word
with
her
before
she
flits
away
may
i
be
excused
he
made
a
courteous
gesture
of
apology
then
smiled
at
eve
she
looked
after
him
as
he
moved
away
i
sometimes
wonder
what
i
should
do
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
the
fraides
she
said
a
little
wistfully
then
almost
at
once
she
laughed
as
if
regretting
her
impulsiveness
you
heard
what
he
said
she
went
on
in
a
different
voice
am
i
really
to
congratulate
you
the
change
of
tone
stung
loder
unaccountably
will
you
always
disbelieve
in
me
he
asked
without
answering
she
walked
slowly
across
the
deserted
terrace
and
pausing
by
the
parapet
laid
her
hand
on
the
stonework
still
in
silence
she
looked
out
across
the
river
loder
had
followed
closely
again
her
aloofness
seemed
a
challenge
will
you
always
disbelieve
in
me
he
repeated
at
last
she
looked
up
at
him
slowly
have
you
ever
given
me
cause
to
believe
she
asked
in
a
quiet
voice
to
this
truth
he
found
no
answer
though
the
subdued
incredulity
nettled
him
afresh
prompted
to
a
further
effort
he
spoke
again
patience
is
necessary
with
every
person
and
every
circumstance
he
said
we
all
got
to
wait
and
she
did
not
lower
her
gaze
as
he
spoke
and
there
seemed
to
him
something
disconcerting
in
the
clear
candid
blue
of
her
eyes
with
a
sudden
dread
of
her
next
words
he
moved
forward
and
laid
his
hand
beside
hers
on
the
parapet
patience
is
needed
for
every
one
he
repeated
quickly
sometimes
a
man
is
like
a
bit
of
wreckage
he
drifts
till
some
force
stronger
than
himself
gets
in
his
way
and
stops
he
looked
again
at
her
face
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
he
only
felt
that
he
was
a
man
in
an
egregiously
false
position
trying
stupidly
to
justify
himself
you
believe
that
flotsam
can
sometimes
be
washed
ashore
he
asked
high
above
them
big
ben
chimed
the
hour
eve
raised
her
head
it
almost
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
see
her
answer
trembling
on
her
lips
then
the
voice
of
lady
sarah
fraide
came
cheerfully
from
behind
them
eve
she
called
eve
we
must
fly
it
absolutely
three
x
in
the
days
that
followed
fraide
marked
adoption
of
him
loder
behaved
with
a
discretion
that
spoke
well
for
his
qualities
many
a
man
placed
in
the
same
responsible
and
yet
strangely
irresponsible
position
might
have
been
excused
if
for
the
time
at
least
he
gave
himself
a
loose
rein
but
loder
kept
free
of
the
temptation
like
all
other
experiments
his
showed
features
when
put
to
a
working
test
its
expected
difficulties
smoothed
themselves
away
while
others
scarcely
anticipated
came
into
prominence
most
notable
of
all
the
physical
likeness
between
himself
and
chilcote
the
bedrock
of
the
whole
scheme
which
had
been
counted
upon
to
offer
most
danger
worked
without
a
hitch
he
stood
literally
amazed
before
the
sweeping
credulity
that
met
him
on
every
hand
men
who
had
known
chilcote
from
his
youth
servants
who
had
been
in
his
employment
for
years
joined
issue
in
the
unquestioning
acceptance
at
times
the
ease
of
the
deception
bewildered
him
there
were
moments
when
he
realized
that
should
circumstances
force
him
to
a
declaration
of
the
truth
he
would
not
be
believed
human
nature
prefers
its
own
eyesight
to
the
testimony
of
any
man
but
in
face
of
this
astonishing
success
he
steered
a
steady
course
in
the
first
exhilaration
of
fraide
favor
in
the
first
egotistical
wish
to
break
down
eve
scepticism
he
might
possibly
have
plunged
into
the
vortex
of
action
let
it
be
in
what
direction
it
might
but
fortunately
for
himself
for
chilcote
and
for
their
scheme
he
was
liable
to
strenuous
second
thoughts
those
wise
and
necessary
curbs
that
go
further
to
the
steadying
of
the
universe
than
the
universe
guesses
sitting
in
the
quiet
of
the
house
on
the
same
day
that
he
had
spoken
with
eve
on
the
terrace
he
had
weighed
possibilities
slowly
and
cautiously
impressed
to
the
full
by
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
that
in
his
eyes
could
never
lack
character
however
dull
its
momentary
business
however
prosy
the
voice
that
filled
it
he
had
sifted
impulse
from
expedience
as
only
a
man
who
has
lived
within
himself
can
sift
and
distinguish
and
at
the
close
of
that
first
day
his
programme
bad
been
formed
there
must
be
no
rush
no
headlong
plunge
he
had
decided
things
must
work
round
it
was
his
first
expedition
into
the
new
country
and
it
lay
with
fate
to
say
whether
it
would
be
his
last
he
had
been
leaning
back
in
his
seat
his
eyes
on
the
ministers
opposite
his
arms
folded
in
imitation
of
chilcote
most
natural
attitude
when
this
final
speculation
had
come
to
him
and
as
it
came
his
lips
had
tightened
for
a
moment
and
his
face
become
hard
and
cold
it
is
an
unpleasant
thing
when
a
man
first
unconsciously
reckons
on
the
weakness
of
another
and
the
look
that
expresses
the
idea
is
not
good
to
see
he
had
stirred
uneasily
then
his
lips
had
closed
again
he
was
tenacious
by
nature
and
by
nature
intolerant
of
weakness
at
the
first
suggestion
of
reckoning
upon
chilcote
lapses
his
mind
had
drawn
back
in
disgust
but
as
the
thought
came
again
the
disgust
had
lessened
in
a
week
two
weeks
perhaps
chilcote
would
reclaim
his
place
then
would
begin
the
routine
of
the
affair
chilcote
fresh
from
indulgence
and
freedom
would
find
his
obligations
a
thousand
times
more
irksome
than
before
he
would
struggle
for
a
time
then
a
shadowy
smile
had
touched
loder
lips
as
the
idea
formed
itself
then
would
come
the
inevitable
recall
then
in
earnest
he
might
venture
to
put
his
hand
to
the
plough
he
never
indulged
in
but
something
in
the
nature
of
a
vision
had
flashed
over
his
mind
in
that
instant
he
had
seen
himself
standing
in
that
same
building
seen
the
rows
of
faces
first
bored
then
hesitatingly
transformed
under
his
personal
domination
under
the
one
great
power
he
knew
himself
to
possess
the
power
of
eloquence
the
strength
of
the
suggestion
had
been
almost
painful
men
who
have
attained
are
occasionally
open
to
a
perilous
onrush
of
feeling
believing
that
they
know
themselves
they
walk
boldly
forward
towards
the
and
the
pitfall
alike
these
had
been
loder
disconnected
ideas
and
speculations
on
the
first
day
of
his
new
life
at
four
on
the
ninth
day
he
was
pacing
with
quiet
confidence
up
and
down
chilcote
study
his
mind
pleasantly
busy
and
his
cigar
comfortably
alight
when
he
paused
in
his
walk
and
frowned
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
servant
the
man
came
softly
into
the
room
drew
a
small
table
towards
the
fire
and
proceeded
to
lay
an
extremely
fine
and
cloth
loder
watched
him
in
silence
he
had
grown
to
find
silence
a
very
useful
commodity
to
wait
and
let
things
develop
was
the
attitude
he
oftenest
assumed
but
on
this
occasion
he
was
perplexed
he
had
not
rung
for
tea
and
in
any
case
a
cup
on
a
salver
satisfied
his
wants
he
looked
critically
at
the
fragile
cloth
presently
the
servant
departed
and
solemnly
reentered
carrying
a
silver
tray
with
cups
a
teapot
and
cakes
having
adjusted
them
to
his
satisfaction
he
turned
to
loder
mrs
chilcote
will
be
with
you
in
five
minutes
sir
he
said
he
waited
for
some
response
but
loder
gave
none
again
he
had
found
the
advantages
of
silence
but
this
time
it
was
silence
of
a
compulsory
kind
he
had
nothing
to
say
the
man
finding
him
irresponsive
retired
and
left
to
himself
loder
stared
at
the
array
of
feminine
trifles
then
turning
abruptly
he
moved
to
the
centre
of
the
room
since
the
day
they
had
talked
on
the
terrace
he
had
only
seen
eve
thrice
and
always
in
the
presence
e
others
since
the
night
of
his
first
coming
she
has
not
invaded
his
domain
and
he
wondered
what
this
new
departure
might
mean
his
thought
of
her
had
been
less
vivid
in
the
last
few
days
for
though
still
using
steady
discretion
he
had
been
drawn
gradually
nearer
the
fascinating
whirlpool
of
new
interests
and
new
work
shut
his
eyes
as
he
might
there
was
no
denying
that
this
moment
so
personally
vital
to
him
was
politically
vital
to
the
whole
country
and
that
by
a
curious
coincidence
chilcote
position
forced
him
to
take
an
active
interest
in
the
situation
again
and
again
the
suggestion
had
arisen
that
should
the
smouldering
fire
in
persia
break
into
a
flame
chilcote
commercial
interests
would
facilitate
would
practically
compel
his
standing
in
in
the
campaign
against
the
government
the
little
incident
of
the
recalling
the
social
side
of
his
obligations
had
aroused
the
realization
of
greater
things
as
he
stood
meditatively
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
saw
suddenly
how
absorbed
he
had
become
in
these
greater
things
how
in
the
swing
of
congenial
interests
he
had
been
borne
insensibly
forward
his
capacities
expanding
his
intelligence
asserting
itself
he
had
so
undeniably
found
his
sphere
that
the
idea
of
usurpation
had
receded
gently
as
by
natural
laws
until
his
own
personality
had
begun
to
color
the
day
work
as
this
knowledge
came
he
wondered
quickly
if
it
held
a
solution
of
the
present
little
comedy
if
eve
had
seen
what
others
he
knew
had
observed
that
chilcote
was
showing
a
grasp
of
things
that
he
had
not
exhibited
for
years
then
as
a
sound
of
skirts
came
softly
down
the
corridor
he
squared
his
shoulders
with
his
habitual
abrupt
gesture
and
threw
his
cigar
into
the
fire
eve
entered
the
room
much
as
she
had
done
on
her
former
visit
but
with
one
difference
in
passing
loder
she
quietly
held
out
her
hand
he
took
it
as
quietly
why
am
i
so
honored
he
said
she
laughed
a
little
and
looked
across
at
the
fire
how
like
a
man
you
always
want
to
begin
with
reasons
let
have
tea
first
and
explanations
she
moved
forward
towards
the
table
and
he
followed
as
he
did
so
it
struck
him
that
her
dress
seemed
in
peculiar
harmony
with
the
day
and
the
room
though
beyond
that
he
could
not
follow
its
details
as
she
paused
beside
the
table
he
drew
forward
a
chair
with
a
faint
touch
of
awkwardness
she
thanked
him
and
sat
down
he
watched
her
in
silence
as
she
poured
out
the
tea
and
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
that
it
was
incredibly
long
since
he
had
seen
a
woman
preside
over
a
meal
the
deftness
of
her
fingers
filled
him
with
an
unfamiliar
wonder
so
interesting
was
the
sensation
that
when
she
held
his
cup
towards
him
he
did
immediately
see
it
do
you
want
any
she
smiled
a
little
he
started
embarrassed
by
his
own
tardiness
i
afraid
i
dull
he
said
i
been
so
so
keen
a
worker
in
the
last
week
for
a
moment
he
felt
relieved
then
as
a
fresh
silence
fell
his
sense
of
awkwardness
returned
he
sipped
his
tea
and
ate
a
biscuit
he
found
himself
wishing
for
almost
the
first
time
for
some
of
the
small
society
talk
that
came
so
pleasantly
to
other
men
he
felt
that
the
position
was
ridiculous
he
glanced
at
eve
averted
head
and
laid
his
empty
cup
upon
the
table
almost
at
once
she
turned
and
their
eyes
met
john
she
said
do
you
guess
at
all
why
i
wanted
to
have
tea
with
you
he
looked
down
at
her
no
he
said
honestly
and
without
embellishment
the
curtness
of
the
answer
might
have
displeased
another
woman
eve
seemed
to
take
no
offence
i
had
a
talk
with
the
fraides
she
said
a
long
talk
fraide
said
great
things
of
you
things
i
would
have
believed
from
anybody
but
she
altered
her
position
and
looked
from
loder
face
back
into
the
fire
he
took
a
step
forward
what
things
he
said
he
was
almost
ashamed
of
the
sudden
inordinate
satisfaction
that
welled
up
at
her
words
oh
i
must
tell
you
she
laughed
a
little
but
you
have
surprised
she
paused
sipped
her
tea
then
looked
up
again
with
a
change
of
expression
john
she
said
more
seriously
there
is
one
point
that
sticks
a
little
will
this
great
change
last
her
voice
was
direct
and
even
wonderfully
direct
for
a
woman
loder
thought
it
came
to
him
with
a
certain
force
that
beneath
her
remarkable
charm
might
possibly
lie
a
remarkable
character
it
was
not
a
possibility
that
had
occurred
to
him
before
and
it
caused
him
to
look
at
her
a
second
time
in
the
new
light
he
saw
her
beauty
differently
and
it
interested
him
differently
heretofore
he
had
been
inclined
to
class
women
under
three
heads
idols
amusements
or
encumbrances
now
it
crossed
his
mind
that
a
woman
might
possibly
fill
another
place
the
place
of
a
companion
you
are
very
sceptical
he
said
still
looking
down
at
her
she
did
not
return
his
glance
i
think
i
have
been
made
sceptical
she
said
as
she
spoke
the
image
of
chilcote
shot
through
his
mind
chilcote
irritable
vicious
unstable
and
a
quick
compassion
for
this
woman
so
inevitably
shackled
to
him
followed
it
eve
unconscious
of
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
went
on
with
her
subject
when
we
were
married
she
said
gently
i
had
such
a
great
interest
in
things
such
a
great
belief
in
life
i
had
lived
in
politics
and
i
was
marrying
one
of
the
coming
men
everybody
said
you
were
one
of
the
coming
men
i
scarcely
felt
there
was
anything
left
to
ask
for
you
did
make
very
ardent
love
she
smiled
but
i
think
i
had
forgotten
about
love
i
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
like
lady
sarah
married
to
a
great
she
paused
then
went
on
more
hurriedly
for
a
while
things
went
right
then
slowly
things
went
wrong
you
got
your
your
loder
changed
his
position
with
something
of
abruptness
she
misconstrued
the
action
please
do
think
i
want
to
be
disagreeable
she
said
hastily
i
do
i
only
trying
to
make
you
understand
why
why
i
lost
i
think
i
know
loder
voice
broke
in
involuntarily
things
got
worse
then
still
worse
you
found
interference
useless
at
last
you
ceased
to
have
a
until
a
week
she
glanced
up
quickly
absorbed
in
her
own
feelings
she
had
seen
nothing
extraordinary
in
his
words
but
at
hers
loder
changed
color
it
the
most
incredible
thing
in
the
world
she
said
it
quite
incredible
and
yet
i
ca
deny
it
against
all
my
reason
all
my
experience
all
my
inclination
i
seem
to
feel
in
the
last
week
something
of
what
i
felt
at
she
stopped
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
it
seems
that
as
if
by
magic
life
has
been
picked
up
where
i
dropped
it
six
years
again
she
stopped
and
laughed
loder
was
keenly
uncomfortable
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
it
seemed
to
begin
that
night
i
dined
with
the
fraides
she
went
on
mr
fraide
talked
so
wisely
and
so
kindly
about
many
things
he
recalled
all
we
had
hoped
for
in
you
and
and
he
blamed
me
a
she
paused
and
laid
her
cup
aside
he
said
that
when
people
have
made
what
they
call
their
last
effort
they
should
always
make
just
one
effort
more
he
promised
that
if
i
could
once
persuade
you
to
take
an
interest
in
your
work
he
would
do
the
rest
he
said
all
that
and
a
thousand
other
kinder
things
and
i
sat
and
listened
but
all
the
time
i
thought
of
nothing
but
their
uselessness
before
i
left
i
promised
to
do
my
best
but
my
thought
was
still
the
same
it
was
stronger
than
ever
when
i
forced
myself
to
come
up
here
she
paused
again
and
glanced
at
loder
averted
head
but
i
came
and
then
as
if
by
conquering
myself
i
had
compelled
a
reward
you
seemed
you
somehow
seemed
different
it
sounds
ridiculous
i
her
voice
was
half
amused
half
deprecating
it
was
a
difference
in
your
face
though
i
knew
directly
that
you
were
free
from
again
she
hesitated
over
the
word
it
was
a
difference
in
yourself
in
the
things
you
said
more
than
in
the
way
you
said
once
more
she
paused
and
laughed
a
little
loder
discomfort
grew
but
it
did
affect
me
she
spoke
more
slowly
i
would
admit
it
then
and
the
next
day
when
we
talked
on
the
terrace
i
still
refused
to
admit
it
though
i
felt
it
more
strongly
than
before
but
i
have
watched
you
since
that
day
and
i
know
there
is
a
change
fraide
feels
the
same
and
he
is
never
mistaken
i
know
it
only
nine
or
ten
days
but
i
hardly
seen
you
in
the
same
mood
for
nine
or
ten
hours
in
the
last
three
she
stopped
and
the
silence
was
expressive
it
seemed
to
plead
for
confirmation
of
her
instinct
still
loder
could
find
no
response
after
waiting
for
a
moment
she
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
and
looked
up
at
him
john
she
said
is
it
going
to
last
that
what
i
came
to
ask
i
do
want
to
believe
till
i
sure
i
do
want
to
risk
a
new
loder
felt
the
earnestness
of
her
gaze
though
he
avoided
meeting
it
i
could
have
said
this
to
you
a
week
ago
but
i
can
i
pretend
to
explain
why
the
feeling
is
too
inexplicable
i
only
know
that
i
can
say
it
now
and
that
i
could
a
week
ago
will
you
understand
and
answer
still
loder
remained
mute
his
position
was
horribly
incongruous
what
could
he
say
what
dared
he
say
confused
by
his
silence
eve
rose
if
it
only
a
phase
do
try
to
hide
it
she
said
but
if
going
to
last
if
by
any
possibility
it
going
to
last
she
hesitated
and
looked
up
she
was
quite
close
to
him
he
would
have
been
less
than
man
had
he
been
unconscious
of
the
subtle
contact
of
her
glance
the
nearness
of
her
presence
and
no
one
had
ever
hinted
that
manhood
was
lacking
in
him
it
was
a
moment
of
temptation
his
own
energy
his
own
intentions
seemed
so
near
chilcote
and
chilcote
claims
so
distant
and
unreal
after
all
his
life
his
ambitions
his
determinations
were
his
own
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
you
want
me
to
tell
you
that
i
will
go
on
he
said
her
eyes
brightened
she
took
a
step
forward
yes
she
said
i
want
it
more
than
anything
in
the
there
was
a
wait
the
declaration
that
would
satisfy
her
came
to
lips
but
he
delayed
it
the
delay
was
fateful
while
he
stood
silent
the
door
opened
and
the
servant
who
had
brought
in
the
tea
reappeared
he
crossed
the
room
and
handed
loder
a
telegram
any
answer
sir
he
said
eve
moved
back
to
her
chair
there
was
a
flush
on
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
still
alertly
bright
loder
tore
the
telegram
open
read
it
then
threw
it
into
the
fire
no
answer
he
said
laconically
at
the
brusqueness
of
his
voice
eve
looked
up
disagreeable
news
she
said
as
the
servant
departed
he
did
look
at
her
he
was
watching
the
telegram
withering
in
the
centre
of
the
fire
no
he
said
at
last
in
a
strained
voice
no
only
news
that
i
that
i
had
forgotten
to
xi
there
was
a
silence
an
uneasy
break
after
loder
spoke
the
episode
of
the
telegram
was
to
all
appearances
ordinary
enough
calling
forth
eve
question
and
his
own
reply
as
a
natural
sequence
yet
in
the
pause
that
followed
it
each
was
conscious
of
a
jar
each
was
aware
that
in
some
subtle
way
the
thread
of
sympathy
had
been
dropped
though
to
one
the
cause
was
inexplicable
and
to
the
other
only
too
plain
loder
watched
the
ghost
of
his
message
grow
whiter
and
thinner
then
dissolve
into
airy
fragments
and
flutter
up
the
chimney
as
the
last
morsel
wavered
out
of
sight
he
turned
and
looked
at
his
companion
you
almost
made
me
commit
myself
he
said
in
the
desire
to
hide
his
feelings
his
tone
was
short
eve
returned
his
glance
with
a
quiet
regard
but
he
scarcely
saw
it
he
had
a
stupefied
sense
of
disaster
a
feeling
of
bitter
that
for
the
moment
outweighed
all
other
considerations
almost
at
the
moment
of
justification
the
good
of
life
had
crumbled
in
his
fingers
the
soil
given
beneath
his
feet
and
with
an
absence
of
logic
a
lack
of
justice
unusual
in
him
he
let
resentment
against
chilcote
sweep
suddenly
over
his
mind
eve
still
watching
him
saw
the
darkening
of
his
expression
and
with
a
quiet
movement
rose
from
her
chair
lady
sarah
has
a
and
i
am
dining
with
her
she
said
it
is
an
early
dinner
so
i
must
think
about
dressing
i
sorry
you
think
i
tried
to
draw
you
into
anything
i
must
have
explained
myself
she
laughed
a
little
to
cover
the
slight
discomfiture
that
her
tone
betrayed
and
as
she
laughed
she
moved
across
the
room
towards
the
door
loder
engrossed
in
the
check
to
his
own
schemes
incensed
at
the
suddenness
of
chilcote
recall
and
still
more
incensed
at
his
own
folly
in
not
having
anticipated
it
was
oblivious
for
the
moment
of
both
her
movement
and
her
words
then
quite
abruptly
they
obtruded
themselves
upon
him
breaking
through
his
egotism
with
something
of
the
sharpness
of
pain
following
a
blow
turning
quickly
from
the
fireplace
he
faced
the
shadowy
room
across
which
she
had
passed
but
simultaneously
with
his
turning
she
gained
the
door
the
knowledge
that
she
was
gone
struck
him
with
a
sense
of
double
loss
wait
he
called
suddenly
moving
forward
but
almost
at
once
he
paused
chilled
by
the
solitude
of
the
room
eve
he
said
using
her
name
unconsciously
for
the
first
time
but
the
corridor
as
well
as
the
room
was
empty
he
was
too
late
he
stood
irresolute
then
he
laughed
shortly
turned
and
passed
back
towards
the
fireplace
the
blow
had
fallen
the
inevitable
come
to
pass
and
nothing
remained
but
to
take
the
fact
with
as
good
a
grace
as
possible
telegram
had
summoned
him
to
clifford
inn
at
seven
and
it
was
now
well
on
towards
six
he
pulled
out
his
watch
chilcote
watch
he
realized
with
a
touch
of
grim
humor
as
he
stooped
to
examine
the
dial
by
the
light
of
the
fire
then
as
if
the
humor
had
verged
to
another
feeling
he
stood
straight
again
and
felt
for
the
electric
button
in
the
wall
his
fingers
touched
it
and
simultaneously
the
room
was
lighted
the
abrupt
alteration
from
shadow
to
light
came
almost
as
a
shock
the
feminine
arrangement
of
the
seemed
incongruous
beside
the
sober
books
and
the
desk
laden
with
papers
incongruous
as
his
own
presence
in
the
place
the
thought
was
unpleasant
and
he
turned
aside
as
if
to
avoid
it
but
at
the
movement
his
eyes
fell
on
with
its
gleaming
monogram
and
the
whimsical
suggestion
of
his
first
morning
rose
again
the
idea
that
the
inanimate
objects
in
the
room
knew
him
for
what
he
was
recognized
the
interloper
where
human
eyes
saw
the
rightful
possessor
returned
to
his
mind
through
all
his
disgust
and
chagrin
a
smile
forced
itself
to
his
lips
and
crossing
the
room
for
the
second
time
he
passed
into
chilcote
bedroom
there
the
massive
furniture
and
sombre
atmosphere
fitted
better
with
his
mood
than
the
energy
and
action
which
the
study
always
suggested
walking
directly
to
the
great
bed
he
sat
on
its
side
and
for
several
minutes
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
apparently
seeing
nothing
then
at
last
the
apathy
passed
from
him
as
his
previous
anger
against
chilcote
had
passed
he
stood
up
slowly
drawing
his
long
limbs
together
and
recrossed
the
room
passing
along
the
corridor
and
through
the
door
communicating
with
the
rest
of
the
house
five
minutes
later
he
was
in
the
open
air
and
walking
steadily
eastward
his
hat
drawn
forward
and
his
overcoat
buttoned
up
as
he
traversed
the
streets
he
allowed
himself
no
thought
once
as
he
waited
in
trafalgar
square
to
find
a
passage
between
the
vehicles
the
remembrance
of
chilcote
voice
coming
out
of
the
fog
on
their
first
night
made
itself
prominent
but
he
rejected
it
quickly
guarding
himself
from
even
an
involuntary
glance
at
the
place
of
their
meeting
the
strand
with
its
unceasing
life
came
to
him
as
something
almost
unfamiliar
since
his
identification
with
the
new
life
no
business
had
drawn
him
east
of
charing
cross
and
his
first
sight
of
the
narrower
stream
of
traffic
struck
him
as
garish
and
unpleasant
as
the
impression
came
he
accelerated
his
steps
moved
by
the
wish
to
make
regret
and
retrospection
alike
impossible
by
a
contact
with
actual
forces
still
walking
hastily
he
entered
clifford
inn
but
there
almost
unconsciously
his
feet
halted
there
was
something
in
the
quiet
immutability
of
the
place
that
sobered
energy
both
mental
and
physical
a
sense
of
changelessness
the
changelessness
of
inanimate
things
that
rises
in
such
solemn
contrast
to
the
variableness
of
mere
human
nature
which
a
new
environment
a
new
outlook
sometimes
even
a
new
presence
has
power
to
upheave
and
remould
he
paused
then
with
slower
and
steadier
steps
crossed
the
little
court
and
mounted
the
familiar
stairs
of
his
own
house
as
he
turned
the
handle
of
his
own
door
some
one
stirred
inside
the
still
under
the
influence
of
the
stones
and
trees
that
he
had
just
left
he
moved
directly
towards
the
sound
and
without
waiting
for
permission
entered
the
room
after
the
darkness
of
the
passage
it
seemed
well
alight
for
besides
the
lamp
with
its
green
shade
a
large
fire
burned
in
the
grate
and
helped
to
dispel
the
shadows
as
he
entered
the
room
chilcote
rose
and
came
forward
his
figure
thrown
into
strong
relief
by
the
double
light
he
was
dressed
in
a
shabby
tweed
suit
his
face
looked
pale
and
set
with
a
slightly
nervous
tension
but
besides
the
look
and
a
certain
added
restlessness
of
glance
there
was
no
visible
change
reaching
loder
he
held
out
his
hand
well
he
said
quickly
the
other
looked
at
him
questioningly
well
well
how
has
it
gone
the
scheme
oh
excellently
loder
manner
was
abrupt
turning
from
the
restless
curiosity
in
chilcote
eyes
he
moved
a
little
way
across
the
room
and
began
to
draw
off
his
coat
then
as
if
struck
by
the
incivility
of
the
action
he
looked
back
again
the
scheme
has
gone
extraordinarily
he
said
i
could
almost
say
absurdly
there
are
some
things
chilcote
that
fairly
bowl
a
man
a
great
relief
tinged
chilcote
face
good
he
exclaimed
tell
me
all
about
but
loder
was
reticent
the
moment
was
not
propitious
it
was
as
if
a
hungry
man
had
dreamed
a
great
banquet
and
had
awakened
to
his
starvation
he
was
chary
of
imparting
his
visions
there
nothing
to
tell
he
said
shortly
all
that
you
want
to
know
is
here
in
black
and
white
i
do
think
you
find
i
have
slipped
anything
it
a
clear
business
from
an
inner
pocket
he
drew
out
a
bulky
and
recrossing
the
room
laid
it
open
on
the
table
it
was
a
correct
even
a
minute
record
of
every
action
that
had
been
accomplished
in
chilcote
name
i
do
think
you
find
any
loose
ends
he
said
as
he
turned
back
the
pages
i
had
you
and
your
position
in
my
mind
all
he
paused
and
glanced
up
from
the
book
you
have
a
position
that
absolutely
insists
upon
attention
he
added
in
a
different
voice
at
the
new
tone
chilcote
looked
up
as
well
no
moral
lectures
he
said
with
a
nervous
laugh
i
was
anxious
to
know
if
you
had
pulled
it
off
and
you
have
reassured
me
that
enough
i
was
in
a
funk
this
afternoon
to
know
how
things
were
of
those
sudden
unreasonable
funks
but
now
that
i
see
you
he
cut
himself
short
and
laughed
once
more
now
that
i
see
you
i
hanged
if
i
do
want
to
to
prolong
your
loder
glanced
at
him
then
glanced
away
he
felt
a
quick
shame
at
the
eagerness
that
rose
at
the
words
a
surprised
contempt
at
his
own
readiness
to
anticipate
the
man
weakness
but
almost
as
speedily
as
he
had
turned
away
he
looked
back
again
tush
man
he
said
with
his
old
intolerant
manner
you
dreaming
you
had
your
holiday
and
school
begun
again
you
must
remember
you
are
dining
with
the
charringtons
young
charrington
coming
of
age
quite
a
big
business
come
along
i
want
my
he
laughed
and
moving
closer
to
chilcote
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
chilcote
started
then
suddenly
becoming
imbued
with
the
manner
he
echoed
the
laugh
by
jove
he
said
you
right
you
quite
right
a
man
must
keep
his
feet
in
their
own
raising
his
hand
he
began
to
fumble
with
his
tie
but
loder
kept
the
same
position
you
find
the
in
its
usual
drawer
he
said
i
made
one
entry
of
a
hundred
pounds
pay
for
the
first
week
the
rest
can
stand
over
until
he
paused
abruptly
chilcote
shifted
his
position
do
talk
about
that
it
upsets
me
to
anticipate
i
can
make
out
a
check
payable
to
john
no
that
can
wait
the
name
of
loder
is
better
out
of
the
book
we
ca
be
too
loder
spoke
with
unusual
impetuosity
already
a
slight
unreasonable
jealousy
was
coloring
his
thoughts
already
he
grudged
the
idea
of
chilcote
with
his
unstable
glance
and
restless
fingers
opening
the
drawers
and
sorting
the
papers
that
for
one
stupendous
fortnight
had
been
his
without
question
turning
aside
he
changed
the
subject
brusquely
come
into
the
bedroom
he
said
it
seven
if
it
a
minute
and
the
charringtons
show
is
at
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
walked
across
the
room
and
held
the
door
open
there
was
no
silence
while
they
exchanged
clothes
loder
talked
continuously
sometimes
in
short
curt
sentences
sometimes
with
ironic
touches
of
humor
he
talked
until
chilcote
strangely
affected
by
contact
with
another
personality
after
his
weeks
of
solitude
fell
under
his
influence
his
excitement
rising
his
imagination
stirring
at
the
novelty
of
change
at
last
garbed
once
more
in
the
clothes
of
his
own
world
he
passed
from
the
bedroom
back
into
the
and
there
halted
waiting
for
his
companion
almost
directly
loder
followed
he
came
into
the
room
quietly
and
moving
at
once
to
the
table
picked
up
the
i
not
going
to
preach
he
began
so
you
need
shut
me
up
but
i
say
just
one
thing
a
thing
that
will
get
said
try
and
keep
your
hold
remember
your
responsibilities
and
keep
your
hold
he
spoke
energetically
looking
earnestly
into
chilcote
eyes
he
did
not
realize
it
but
he
was
pleading
for
his
own
career
chilcote
paled
a
little
as
he
always
did
in
face
of
a
reality
then
he
extended
his
hand
my
dear
fellow
he
said
with
a
touch
of
hauteur
a
man
can
generally
be
trusted
to
look
after
his
own
extricating
his
hand
almost
immediately
he
turned
towards
the
door
and
without
a
word
of
farewell
passed
into
the
little
hall
leaving
loder
alone
in
the
xii
on
the
night
of
chilcote
return
to
his
own
loder
tasted
the
lees
of
life
poignantly
for
the
first
time
before
their
curious
compact
had
been
entered
upon
he
had
been
if
not
content
at
least
apathetic
but
with
action
the
apathy
had
been
dispersed
never
again
to
regain
its
old
position
he
realized
with
bitter
certainty
that
his
was
no
real
on
entering
chilcote
house
he
had
experienced
none
of
the
unfamiliarity
none
of
the
unsettled
awkwardness
that
assailed
him
now
there
he
had
almost
seemed
the
exile
returning
after
many
hardships
here
in
the
atmosphere
made
common
by
years
he
felt
an
alien
it
was
illustrative
of
the
man
character
that
sentimentalities
found
no
place
in
his
nature
sentiments
were
not
lacking
though
they
lay
out
of
sight
but
sentimentalities
he
altogether
denied
left
alone
in
the
after
chilcote
departure
his
first
sensation
was
one
of
physical
discomfort
and
unfamiliarity
his
own
clothes
with
their
worn
looseness
brought
no
sense
of
friendliness
such
as
some
men
find
in
an
old
garment
lounging
and
the
clothes
that
suggested
lounging
had
no
appeal
for
him
in
his
eyes
the
garb
that
implies
responsibility
was
symbolic
and
even
inspiring
and
as
with
clothes
so
with
his
actual
surroundings
each
detail
of
his
room
was
familiar
but
not
one
had
ever
become
intimately
close
he
had
used
the
place
for
years
but
he
had
used
it
as
he
might
use
a
hotel
and
whatever
of
his
household
gods
had
come
with
him
remained
like
himself
on
sufferance
his
entrance
into
chilcote
surroundings
had
been
altogether
different
unknown
to
himself
he
had
been
in
the
position
of
a
young
artist
who
having
roughly
modelled
in
clay
is
brought
into
the
studio
of
a
sculptor
to
his
outward
vision
everything
is
new
but
his
inner
sight
leaps
to
instant
understanding
amid
all
the
strangeness
he
recognizes
the
one
essential
the
workshop
the
atmosphere
the
home
on
this
first
night
of
return
loder
comprehended
something
of
his
position
and
comprehending
he
faced
the
problem
and
fought
with
it
he
had
made
his
bargain
and
must
pay
his
share
weighing
this
he
had
looked
about
his
room
with
a
quiet
gaze
then
at
last
as
if
finding
the
object
really
sought
for
his
eyes
had
come
round
to
the
and
rested
on
the
the
pipes
stood
precisely
as
he
had
left
them
he
had
looked
at
them
for
a
long
time
then
an
ironic
expression
that
was
almost
a
smile
had
touched
his
lips
and
crossing
the
room
he
had
taken
the
oldest
and
blackest
from
its
place
and
slowly
filled
it
with
tobacco
with
the
first
indrawn
breath
of
smoke
his
attitude
had
unbent
without
conscious
determination
he
had
chosen
the
one
factor
capable
of
easing
his
mood
a
cigarette
is
for
the
trivial
moments
of
life
a
cigar
for
its
fulfilments
its
pleasant
comfortable
retrospections
but
in
real
distress
in
the
solving
of
question
the
fighting
of
difficulty
a
pipe
is
man
eternal
solace
so
he
had
passed
the
first
night
of
his
return
to
the
actualities
of
life
next
day
his
mind
was
somewhat
settled
and
outward
aid
was
not
so
essential
but
though
facts
faced
him
more
solidly
they
were
nevertheless
very
drab
in
shade
the
necessity
for
work
that
blessed
antidote
to
ennui
no
longer
forced
him
to
endeavor
he
was
no
longer
penniless
but
the
money
he
possessed
brought
with
it
no
desires
when
a
man
has
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
for
years
and
suddenly
finds
himself
with
a
hundred
pounds
in
his
pocket
the
result
is
sometimes
curious
he
finds
with
a
vague
sense
of
surprise
that
he
has
forgotten
how
to
spend
that
extravagance
like
other
artificial
passions
requires
cultivation
this
he
realized
even
more
fully
on
the
days
that
followed
the
night
of
his
first
return
and
with
it
was
born
a
new
bitterness
the
man
who
has
friends
and
no
money
may
find
life
difficult
but
the
man
who
has
money
and
no
friend
to
rejoice
in
his
fortune
or
benefit
by
his
generosity
is
aloof
indeed
with
the
leaven
of
incredulity
that
works
in
all
strong
natures
loder
distrusted
the
professional
beggar
therefore
the
charity
that
bestows
easily
and
promiscuously
was
denied
him
and
of
other
channels
of
generosity
he
was
too
to
have
learned
the
secret
when
depression
falls
upon
a
man
of
usually
even
temperament
it
descends
with
a
double
weight
the
mercurial
nature
has
a
hundred
counterbalancing
devices
to
rid
itself
of
gloom
a
sudden
lifting
of
spirit
a
memory
of
other
moods
lived
through
other
blacknesses
dispersed
by
time
but
the
man
of
level
nature
has
none
of
these
depression
when
it
comes
is
indeed
depression
no
phase
of
mind
to
be
superseded
by
another
phase
but
a
slackening
of
all
the
chords
of
life
it
was
through
such
a
depression
as
this
that
he
labored
during
three
weeks
while
no
summons
and
no
hint
of
remembrance
came
from
chilcote
his
position
was
peculiarly
difficult
he
found
no
action
in
the
present
and
towards
the
future
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
look
he
had
slipped
the
old
moorings
that
familiarity
had
rendered
endurable
but
having
slipped
them
he
had
found
no
substitute
such
was
his
case
on
the
last
night
of
the
three
weeks
and
such
his
frame
of
mind
as
he
crossed
fleet
street
from
clifford
inn
to
middle
temple
lane
it
was
scarcely
seven
but
already
the
dusk
was
falling
the
greater
press
of
vehicles
had
ceased
and
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
gleamed
back
from
the
spaces
of
dry
and
polished
roadway
worn
smooth
as
a
mirror
by
wheels
and
hoofs
something
of
the
solitude
of
night
that
sits
so
ill
on
the
strenuous
city
street
was
making
itself
felt
though
the
throngs
of
people
on
the
pathway
still
streamed
eastward
and
westward
and
the
taverns
made
a
busy
trade
having
crossed
the
roadway
loder
paused
for
a
moment
to
survey
the
scene
but
humanity
in
the
abstract
made
small
appeal
to
him
and
his
glance
wandered
from
the
to
the
buildings
massed
like
clouds
against
the
dark
sky
as
his
gaze
moved
slowly
from
one
to
the
other
a
clock
near
at
hand
struck
seven
and
an
instant
later
the
chorus
was
taken
up
by
a
dozen
clamorous
tongues
usually
he
scarcely
heard
and
never
heeded
these
innumerable
chimes
but
this
evening
their
effect
was
strange
coming
out
of
the
darkness
they
seemed
to
possess
a
personal
note
a
human
declaration
the
impression
was
fantastic
but
it
was
strong
with
a
species
of
revolt
against
life
and
his
own
personality
he
turned
slowly
and
moved
forward
in
the
direction
of
ludgate
hill
for
a
space
he
continued
his
course
then
reaching
bouverie
street
he
turned
sharply
to
the
right
and
made
his
way
down
the
slight
incline
that
leads
to
the
embankment
there
he
paused
and
drew
a
long
breath
the
sense
of
space
and
darkness
soothed
him
pulling
his
cap
over
his
eyes
he
crossed
to
the
river
and
walked
on
in
the
direction
of
westminster
bridge
as
he
walked
the
great
mass
of
water
by
his
side
looked
dense
and
smooth
as
oil
with
its
sweeping
width
and
network
of
reflected
light
on
its
farther
bank
rose
the
tall
buildings
the
chimneys
the
flaring
lights
that
suggest
another
and
an
alien
london
close
at
hand
stretched
the
solid
stone
parapet
giving
assurance
of
protection
all
these
things
he
saw
with
his
mental
eyes
but
with
his
mental
eyes
only
for
his
physical
gaze
was
fixed
ahead
where
the
houses
of
parliament
loomed
out
of
the
dusk
from
the
great
building
his
eyes
never
wavered
until
the
embankment
was
traversed
and
westminster
bridge
reached
then
he
paused
resting
his
arms
on
the
coping
of
the
bridge
in
the
tense
quietude
of
the
darkness
the
place
looked
vast
and
inspiring
the
shadowy
terrace
the
silent
river
the
rows
of
lighted
windows
each
was
significant
slowly
and
comprehensively
his
glance
passed
from
one
to
the
other
he
was
no
sentimentalist
and
no
dreamer
his
act
was
simply
the
act
of
a
man
whose
interests
robbed
of
their
natural
outlet
turn
instinctively
towards
the
forms
and
symbols
of
the
work
that
is
denied
them
his
scrutiny
was
steady
even
cold
he
was
raised
to
no
exaltation
by
the
vastness
of
the
building
nor
was
he
chilled
by
any
dwarfing
of
himself
he
looked
at
it
long
and
thoughtfully
then
again
moving
slowly
he
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
his
mind
was
full
as
he
walked
back
still
oblivious
of
the
stone
parapet
of
the
embankment
the
bare
trees
and
the
flaring
lights
of
the
advertisements
across
the
water
turning
to
the
left
he
regained
fleet
street
and
made
for
his
own
habitation
with
the
quiet
accuracy
that
some
men
exhibit
in
moments
of
absorption
he
crossed
clifford
inn
with
the
same
slow
almost
listless
step
then
as
his
own
doorway
came
into
view
he
stopped
some
one
was
standing
in
its
recess
for
a
moment
he
wondered
if
his
fancy
were
playing
him
a
trick
then
his
reason
sprang
to
certainty
with
so
fierce
a
leap
that
for
an
instant
his
mind
recoiled
for
we
more
often
stand
aghast
at
the
strength
of
our
own
feelings
than
before
the
enormity
of
our
neighbor
actions
is
that
you
chilcote
he
said
below
his
breath
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
other
wheeled
round
hallo
he
said
i
thought
you
were
the
ghost
of
some
old
inhabitant
i
suppose
i
am
very
unexpected
loder
took
the
hand
that
he
extended
and
pressed
the
fingers
unconsciously
the
sight
of
this
man
was
like
the
finding
of
an
oasis
at
the
point
where
the
desert
is
sandiest
deadliest
most
unbearable
yes
you
are
unexpected
he
answered
chilcote
looked
at
him
then
looked
out
into
the
court
i
done
up
he
said
i
right
at
the
end
of
the
he
laughed
as
he
said
it
but
in
the
dim
light
of
the
hall
loder
thought
his
face
looked
ill
and
harassed
despite
the
flush
that
the
excitement
of
the
meeting
had
brought
to
it
taking
his
arm
he
drew
him
towards
the
stairs
so
the
rope
has
run
out
eh
he
said
in
imitation
of
the
tone
but
under
the
quiet
of
his
manner
his
own
nerves
were
throbbing
with
the
peculiar
alertness
of
anticipation
a
sudden
sense
of
mastery
over
life
that
lifted
him
above
surroundings
and
above
persons
a
sense
of
stature
mental
and
physical
from
which
he
surveyed
the
world
he
felt
as
if
fate
in
the
moment
of
utter
darkness
had
given
him
a
sign
as
they
crossed
the
hall
chilcote
had
drawn
away
and
was
already
mounting
the
stairs
and
as
loder
followed
it
came
sharply
to
his
mind
that
here
in
the
slipshod
freedom
of
a
door
that
was
always
open
and
stairs
that
were
innocent
of
covering
lay
his
companion
real
niche
unrecognized
in
outward
avowal
but
acknowledged
by
the
inward
keener
sense
that
manifests
the
individual
in
silence
they
mounted
the
stairs
but
on
the
first
landing
chilcote
paused
and
looked
back
surveying
loder
from
the
superior
height
of
two
steps
i
did
very
well
at
first
he
said
i
did
very
well
i
almost
followed
your
example
for
a
week
or
so
i
found
myself
on
a
sort
of
pinnacle
and
i
clung
on
but
in
the
last
ten
days
i
i
rather
why
loder
avoided
looking
at
his
face
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
determinately
on
the
spot
where
his
own
hand
gripped
the
banister
why
chilcote
repeated
oh
the
prehistoric
tale
weakness
stronger
than
strength
sorry
to
come
down
on
you
like
this
but
it
the
social
side
that
bowls
me
over
it
the
social
side
i
ca
the
social
side
but
i
thought
do
think
i
never
think
it
entails
such
a
constant
upsetting
of
principles
and
theories
we
did
arrange
for
business
only
but
one
ca
set
up
barriers
society
pushes
itself
everywhere
nowadays
into
business
most
of
all
i
do
want
you
for
or
dinners
but
a
big
reception
with
a
political
flavor
is
different
a
man
has
to
be
seen
at
these
things
he
need
say
anything
or
do
anything
but
it
bad
form
if
he
fails
to
show
loder
raised
his
head
you
must
explain
he
said
abruptly
chilcote
started
slightly
at
the
sudden
demand
i
i
suppose
i
rather
irrelevant
he
said
quickly
fact
is
there
a
reception
at
the
bramfells
you
know
blanche
bramfell
viscountess
bramfell
sister
to
lillian
his
words
conveyed
nothing
to
loder
but
he
did
not
consider
that
all
explanations
were
irksome
to
him
and
he
invariably
chafed
to
be
done
with
them
and
you
got
to
put
in
an
appearance
for
party
reasons
loder
broke
in
chilcote
showed
relief
yes
old
fraide
makes
rather
a
point
of
it
so
does
he
said
the
last
words
carelessly
then
as
if
their
sound
recalled
something
his
expression
changed
a
touch
of
satirical
amusement
touched
his
lips
and
he
laughed
loder
he
said
my
wife
was
actually
tolerant
of
me
for
nine
or
ten
days
after
my
return
i
thought
your
representation
was
to
be
quite
impersonal
i
not
jealous
he
laughed
i
not
jealous
i
assure
you
but
the
burned
child
should
grow
at
his
tone
and
his
laugh
loder
blood
stirred
with
a
sudden
unexpected
impulse
his
hand
tightened
on
the
banister
and
looking
up
he
caught
sight
of
the
face
above
him
his
own
face
it
seemed
alight
with
malicious
interest
at
the
sight
a
strange
sensation
seized
him
his
grip
on
the
banister
loosened
and
pushing
past
chilcote
he
hurriedly
mounted
the
stairs
outside
his
own
door
the
other
overtook
him
loder
he
said
loder
i
meant
no
harm
a
man
must
have
a
laugh
but
loder
was
facing
the
door
and
did
not
turn
round
a
sudden
fear
shook
chilcote
loder
he
exclaimed
again
you
desert
me
i
ca
go
back
i
ca
go
still
loder
remained
immovable
alarmed
by
his
silence
chilcote
stepped
closer
to
him
loder
loder
you
wo
desert
me
he
caught
hastily
at
his
arm
with
a
quick
repulsion
loder
shook
him
off
then
almost
as
quickly
he
turned
round
what
fools
we
all
are
he
said
abruptly
we
only
differ
in
degree
come
in
and
let
us
change
our
xiii
the
best
moments
of
a
man
life
are
the
moments
when
strong
in
himself
he
feels
that
the
world
lies
before
him
gratified
ambition
may
be
the
summer
but
anticipation
is
the
ardent
of
a
career
as
loder
drove
that
night
frown
fleet
street
to
grosvenor
square
he
realized
this
though
scarcely
with
any
degree
of
consciousness
for
he
was
no
accomplished
but
in
a
wave
of
feeling
too
vigorous
to
be
denied
he
recognized
his
regained
foothold
the
step
that
lifted
him
at
once
from
the
pit
to
the
pinnacle
in
that
moment
of
realization
he
looked
neither
backward
nor
forward
the
present
was
difficulties
might
loom
ahead
but
difficulties
had
but
one
object
the
testing
and
sharpening
of
a
strength
in
the
first
deep
surge
of
egotistical
feeling
he
almost
rejoiced
in
chilcote
weakness
the
more
chilcote
tangled
the
threads
of
his
life
the
stronger
must
be
the
fingers
that
unravelled
them
he
was
possessed
by
a
great
impatience
the
joy
of
action
was
stirring
in
his
blood
leaving
the
cab
he
walked
confidently
to
the
door
of
chilcote
house
and
inserted
the
even
in
this
small
act
there
was
a
grain
of
individual
satisfaction
then
very
quietly
he
opened
the
door
and
crossed
the
hall
as
he
entered
a
footman
was
arranging
the
fire
that
burned
in
the
big
grate
seeing
the
man
he
halted
where
is
your
mistress
he
asked
in
unconscious
repetition
of
his
first
question
in
the
same
house
the
man
looked
up
she
has
just
finished
dinner
sir
she
dined
alone
in
her
own
he
glanced
at
loder
in
the
quick
uncertain
way
that
was
noticeable
in
all
the
servants
of
the
household
when
they
addressed
their
master
loder
saw
the
look
and
wondered
what
depth
of
curiosity
it
betrayed
how
much
of
insight
into
the
domestic
life
that
he
must
always
be
content
to
skim
for
an
instant
the
old
resentment
against
chilcote
tinged
his
exaltation
but
he
swept
it
angrily
aside
without
further
remark
he
began
to
mount
the
stairs
gaining
the
landing
he
did
not
turn
as
usual
to
the
door
that
shut
off
chilcote
rooms
but
moved
onward
down
the
corridor
towards
private
he
moved
slowly
till
the
door
was
reached
then
he
paused
and
lifted
his
hand
there
was
a
moment
wait
while
his
fingers
rested
on
the
handle
then
a
sensation
he
could
not
explain
a
reticence
a
reluctance
to
intrude
upon
this
one
precinct
caused
his
fingers
to
relax
with
a
slightly
embarrassed
gesture
he
drew
back
slowly
and
retraced
his
steps
once
in
chilcote
bedroom
he
walked
to
the
nearest
bell
and
pressed
it
renwick
responded
and
at
sight
of
him
loder
feelings
warmed
with
the
same
sense
of
fitness
and
familiarity
that
the
great
bed
and
sombre
furniture
of
the
room
had
inspired
but
the
man
did
not
come
forward
as
he
had
expected
he
remained
close
to
the
door
with
a
hesitation
that
was
unusual
in
a
trained
servant
it
struck
loder
that
possibly
his
stolidity
had
exasperated
chilcote
and
that
possibly
chilcote
had
been
at
no
pains
to
conceal
the
exasperation
the
idea
caused
him
to
smile
involuntarily
come
into
the
room
renwick
he
said
it
uncomfortable
to
see
you
standing
there
i
want
to
know
if
chilcote
has
sent
me
any
message
about
renwick
studied
him
furtively
as
he
came
forward
yes
sir
he
said
mrs
chilcote
maid
said
that
the
carriage
was
ordered
for
and
she
hoped
that
would
suit
he
spoke
reluctantly
as
if
expecting
a
rebuke
at
the
opening
sentence
loder
had
turned
aside
but
now
as
the
man
finished
he
wheeled
round
again
and
looked
at
him
closely
with
his
keen
observant
eyes
look
here
he
said
i
ca
have
you
speak
to
me
like
that
i
may
come
down
on
you
rather
sharply
when
my
my
nerves
are
bad
but
when
myself
i
treat
you
well
i
treat
you
decently
at
any
rate
have
to
learn
to
discriminate
look
at
me
now
a
thrill
of
risk
and
of
rulership
passed
through
him
as
he
spoke
look
at
me
now
do
i
look
as
i
looked
this
morning
or
yesterday
the
man
eyed
him
half
stupidly
half
timidly
well
loder
insisted
well
sir
renwick
responded
with
some
slowness
you
look
the
same
and
you
look
different
a
healthier
color
perhaps
sir
and
the
eye
he
grew
more
confident
under
loder
gaze
now
that
i
look
closer
sir
loder
laughed
that
it
he
said
now
that
you
look
closer
have
to
grow
observant
observation
is
an
excellent
quality
in
a
servant
wheat
you
come
into
a
room
in
future
look
first
of
all
at
me
and
take
your
cue
from
that
remember
that
serving
a
man
with
nerves
is
like
serving
two
masters
now
you
can
go
and
tell
maid
that
i
shall
be
quite
ready
at
a
yes
sir
and
after
that
nothing
further
i
want
you
again
he
turned
away
as
he
spoke
and
moved
towards
the
great
fire
that
was
always
kept
alight
in
chilcote
room
but
as
the
man
moved
towards
the
door
he
wheeled
back
again
oh
one
thing
more
renwick
bring
me
some
sandwiches
and
a
he
remembered
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
early
afternoon
at
a
few
minutes
after
ten
loder
left
chilcote
room
resolutely
descended
the
stairs
and
took
up
his
position
in
the
hall
resolution
is
a
strong
word
to
apply
to
such
a
proceeding
but
something
in
his
bearing
in
the
attitude
of
his
shoulders
and
head
instinctively
suggested
it
five
or
six
minutes
passed
but
he
waited
without
impatience
then
at
last
the
sound
of
a
carriage
stopping
before
the
house
caused
him
to
lift
his
head
and
at
the
same
instant
eve
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
she
stood
there
for
a
second
looking
down
on
him
her
maid
a
pace
or
two
behind
holding
her
cloak
the
picture
she
made
struck
upon
his
mind
with
something
of
a
revelation
on
his
first
sight
of
her
she
had
appealed
to
him
as
a
strange
blending
of
youth
and
a
girl
with
a
woman
clearer
perception
of
life
later
he
had
been
drawn
to
study
her
in
other
aspects
as
a
possible
comrade
and
friend
now
for
the
first
time
he
saw
her
as
a
power
in
her
own
world
a
woman
to
whom
no
man
could
deny
consideration
she
looked
taller
for
the
distance
between
them
and
the
distinction
of
her
carriage
added
to
the
effect
her
black
gown
was
exquisitely
soft
as
soft
as
her
black
hair
above
her
forehead
was
a
cluster
of
splendid
diamonds
shaped
like
a
coronet
and
a
band
of
the
same
stones
encircled
her
neck
loder
realized
in
a
glance
that
only
the
most
distinguished
of
women
could
wear
such
ornaments
and
not
have
her
beauty
eclipsed
with
a
touch
of
the
old
awkwardness
that
had
before
assailed
him
in
her
presence
he
came
slowly
forward
as
she
descended
the
stairs
can
i
help
you
with
your
cloak
he
asked
and
as
he
asked
it
something
like
surprise
at
his
own
timidity
crossed
his
mind
for
a
second
eve
glance
rested
on
his
face
her
expression
was
quite
impassive
but
as
she
lowered
her
lashes
a
faint
gleam
flickered
across
her
eyes
nevertheless
her
answer
when
it
came
was
studiously
courteous
thank
you
she
said
but
marie
will
do
all
i
loder
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
then
turned
aside
he
was
not
hurt
by
his
rebuff
rather
by
an
interesting
sequence
of
impressions
he
was
stirred
by
it
the
pride
that
had
refused
chilcote
help
and
the
that
had
refused
it
graciously
moved
him
to
admiration
he
understood
and
appreciated
both
by
the
light
of
person
experience
the
carriage
is
waiting
sir
crapham
voice
broke
in
loder
nodded
and
eve
turned
to
her
maid
that
will
do
marie
she
said
i
shall
want
a
cup
of
chocolate
when
i
get
back
probably
at
one
o
she
drew
her
cloak
about
her
shoulders
and
moved
towards
the
door
then
she
paused
and
looked
back
shall
we
start
she
asked
quietly
loder
still
watching
her
came
forward
at
once
certainly
he
said
with
unusual
gentleness
he
followed
her
as
she
crossed
the
footpath
but
made
no
further
offer
of
help
and
when
the
moment
came
he
quietly
took
his
place
beside
her
in
the
carriage
his
last
impression
as
the
horses
wheeled
round
was
of
the
open
hall
door
crapham
in
his
sombre
livery
and
the
maid
in
her
black
dress
both
silhouetted
against
the
dark
background
of
the
hall
then
as
the
carriage
moved
forward
smoothly
and
rapidly
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
and
closed
his
eyes
during
the
first
few
moments
of
the
drive
there
was
silence
to
loder
there
was
a
strange
new
sensation
in
this
companionship
so
close
and
yet
so
distant
he
was
so
near
to
eve
that
the
slight
fragrant
scent
from
her
clothes
might
almost
have
belonged
to
his
own
the
impression
was
confusing
yet
vaguely
delightful
it
was
years
since
he
had
been
so
close
to
a
woman
of
his
own
class
his
own
caste
he
acknowledged
the
thought
with
a
curious
sense
of
pleasure
involuntarily
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
she
was
sitting
very
straight
her
fine
profile
cut
clear
against
the
carriage
window
her
diamonds
quivering
in
the
light
that
flashed
by
them
from
the
street
for
a
space
the
sense
of
unreality
that
had
pervaded
his
first
entrance
into
chilcote
life
touched
him
again
then
another
and
more
potent
feeling
rose
to
quell
it
almost
involuntarily
as
he
looked
at
her
his
lips
parted
may
i
say
something
he
asked
eve
remained
motionless
she
did
not
turn
her
head
as
most
women
would
have
done
say
anything
you
like
she
said
gravely
anything
he
bent
a
little
nearer
filled
again
by
the
inordinate
wish
to
dominate
of
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
voice
sounded
forced
and
a
little
tired
for
a
moment
he
looked
through
the
window
at
the
passing
lights
then
slowly
his
gaze
returned
to
her
face
you
look
very
beautiful
he
said
his
voice
was
low
and
his
manner
unemotional
but
his
words
had
the
effect
he
desired
she
turned
her
head
and
her
eyes
met
his
in
a
glance
of
curiosity
and
surprise
slight
as
the
triumph
was
it
thrilled
him
the
small
scene
with
chilcote
valet
came
back
to
him
his
own
personality
moved
him
again
to
a
reckless
determination
to
make
his
own
voice
heard
leaning
forward
he
laid
his
hand
lightly
on
her
arm
eve
he
said
quickly
eve
do
you
remember
then
he
paused
and
withdrew
his
hand
the
horses
had
slackened
speed
then
stopped
altogether
as
the
carriage
fell
into
line
outside
bramfell
house
xiv
loder
entered
lady
bramfell
feeling
far
more
like
an
actor
in
a
drama
than
an
ordinary
man
in
a
peculiar
situation
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
played
chilcote
to
a
purely
social
audience
and
the
first
time
for
many
years
that
he
had
rubbed
shoulders
with
a
crowd
ostensibly
brought
together
for
amusement
as
he
followed
eve
along
the
corridor
that
led
to
the
he
questioned
the
reality
of
the
position
again
and
again
then
abruptly
at
the
moment
when
the
sensation
of
unfamiliarity
was
strongest
a
cheery
voice
hailed
him
and
turning
he
saw
the
square
shoulders
light
eyes
and
pointed
mustache
of
lakeley
the
owner
of
the
george
gazette
at
the
sight
of
the
man
and
the
sound
of
his
greeting
his
doubts
and
speculations
vanished
the
essentials
of
life
rose
again
to
the
position
they
had
occupied
three
weeks
ago
in
the
short
but
strenuous
period
when
his
dormant
activities
had
been
stirred
and
he
had
recognized
his
true
self
he
lifted
his
head
unconsciously
the
shade
of
misgiving
that
had
crossed
his
confidence
passing
from
him
as
he
smiled
at
lakeley
with
a
keen
alert
pleasure
that
altered
his
whole
face
eve
looking
back
saw
the
expression
it
attracted
and
held
her
like
a
sudden
glimpse
into
a
secret
room
in
all
the
years
of
her
marriage
in
the
months
of
her
courtship
even
she
had
never
surprised
the
look
on
chilcote
face
the
impression
came
quickly
and
with
it
a
strange
warm
rush
of
interest
that
receded
slowly
leaving
an
odd
sense
of
loneliness
but
at
the
moment
that
the
feeling
came
and
passed
her
attention
was
claimed
in
another
direction
a
slight
boy
forced
his
way
towards
her
through
the
press
of
people
that
filled
the
corridor
mrs
chilcote
he
exclaimed
can
i
believe
my
luck
in
finding
you
alone
eve
laughed
it
seemed
that
there
was
relief
in
her
laugh
how
absurd
you
are
bobby
she
said
kindly
but
you
are
wrong
my
husband
is
here
i
am
waiting
for
blessington
looked
round
oh
he
said
indeed
then
he
relapsed
into
silence
he
was
the
soul
of
but
those
who
knew
him
best
knew
that
chilcote
summary
change
of
secretaries
had
rankled
eve
conscious
of
the
little
jar
made
haste
to
smooth
it
away
tell
me
about
yourself
she
said
what
have
you
been
doing
blessington
looked
at
her
then
smiled
again
his
buoyancy
restored
doing
he
said
oh
calling
every
other
afternoon
at
grosvenor
square
only
to
find
that
a
certain
lady
is
never
at
at
his
tone
eve
laughed
again
the
boy
with
his
frank
and
ingenuous
nature
had
beguiled
many
a
dull
hour
for
her
in
past
days
and
she
had
missed
him
not
a
little
when
his
place
had
been
filled
by
greening
but
i
mean
seriously
bobby
has
something
good
turned
up
blessington
made
a
wry
face
something
is
on
its
way
that
why
i
am
on
duty
old
bramfell
and
the
pater
are
working
it
between
them
so
if
lady
bramfell
or
lady
astrupp
happen
to
drop
a
fan
or
a
handkerchief
this
evening
i
got
to
be
here
to
pick
it
up
see
as
you
picked
up
my
fans
and
handkerchiefs
last
year
and
the
year
before
eve
smiled
blessington
face
suddenly
looked
grave
i
wish
you
had
said
that
he
said
then
he
paused
abruptly
out
of
the
hum
of
talk
behind
them
a
man
laugh
sounded
it
was
not
loud
but
it
was
a
laugh
that
one
seldom
hears
in
a
london
it
expressed
interest
amusement
and
in
an
inexplicable
may
it
seemed
also
to
express
strength
eve
and
blessington
both
turned
involuntarily
by
jove
said
blessington
eve
said
nothing
loder
was
parting
with
lakely
and
his
was
the
laugh
that
had
attracted
them
both
the
interest
excited
by
his
talk
was
still
reflected
in
his
face
and
bearing
as
he
made
his
way
towards
them
by
jove
said
blessington
again
i
never
realized
that
chilcote
was
so
again
eve
said
nothing
but
silently
and
with
a
more
subtle
meaning
she
found
herself
echoing
the
words
until
he
was
quite
close
to
her
loder
did
not
seem
to
see
her
then
he
stopped
quietly
i
was
speaking
to
lakely
he
said
he
wants
me
to
dine
with
him
one
night
at
cadogan
but
eve
was
silent
waiting
for
him
to
address
blessington
she
glanced
at
him
quickly
but
though
their
eyes
met
he
did
not
catch
the
meaning
that
lay
in
hers
it
was
a
difficult
moment
she
had
known
him
incredibly
almost
unpardonably
but
it
had
invariably
been
when
he
was
suffering
from
nerves
as
she
phrased
it
to
herself
but
he
was
obviously
in
the
possession
of
unclouded
faculties
she
colored
slightly
and
glanced
under
her
lashes
at
blessington
had
the
same
idea
struck
him
she
wondered
but
he
was
studiously
studying
a
suit
of
chinese
armor
that
stood
close
by
in
a
niche
of
the
wall
bobby
has
been
keeping
me
amused
while
you
talked
to
lakely
she
said
pointedly
directly
addressed
loder
turned
and
looked
at
blessington
how
do
he
said
with
doubtful
cordiality
the
name
of
bobby
conveyed
nothing
to
him
to
his
surprise
eve
looked
annoyed
and
blessington
face
deepened
in
tone
with
a
slow
uncomfortable
sensation
he
was
aware
of
having
struck
a
wrong
note
there
was
a
short
unpleasant
pause
then
more
by
intuition
than
actual
sight
blessington
saw
eve
eyes
turn
from
him
to
loder
and
with
quick
tact
he
saved
the
situation
how
do
sir
he
responded
with
a
smile
i
congratulate
you
on
looking
so
so
uncommon
well
i
was
just
telling
chilcote
that
i
hold
a
commission
for
lady
astrupp
i
a
sort
of
scout
at
present
reporting
on
the
he
spoke
fast
and
without
much
meaning
but
his
boyish
voice
eased
the
strain
eve
thanked
him
with
a
smile
then
we
must
interfere
with
a
person
on
active
service
she
said
besides
we
have
our
own
duties
to
get
she
smiled
again
and
touching
loder
arm
indicated
the
when
they
entered
the
larger
of
the
two
rooms
lady
bramfell
was
still
receiving
her
guests
she
was
a
tall
and
angular
woman
who
except
for
a
certain
beauty
of
hands
and
feet
and
a
certain
similarity
of
voice
possessed
nothing
in
common
with
her
sister
lillian
she
was
speaking
to
a
group
of
people
as
they
approached
and
the
first
sound
of
her
sweet
and
rather
drawling
tones
touched
loder
with
a
curious
momentary
feeling
a
vague
suggestion
of
awakened
memories
then
the
suggestion
vanished
as
she
turned
and
greeted
eve
how
sweet
of
you
to
come
she
murmured
and
it
seemed
to
loder
that
a
more
spontaneous
smile
lighted
up
her
face
then
she
extended
her
hand
to
him
and
you
too
she
added
though
i
fear
we
shall
bore
you
watching
her
with
interest
he
saw
the
change
of
expression
as
her
eyes
turned
from
eve
to
him
and
noticed
a
colder
tone
in
her
voice
as
she
addressed
him
directly
the
observation
moved
him
to
that
a
poor
compliment
to
me
he
said
to
be
bored
is
surely
only
a
polite
way
of
being
lady
bramfell
smiled
what
she
exclaimed
you
defending
your
social
reputation
loder
laughed
a
little
the
smaller
it
is
the
more
defending
it
needs
he
replied
another
stream
of
arrivals
swept
by
them
as
he
spoke
eve
smiled
at
their
hostess
and
moved
across
the
room
and
he
perforce
followed
as
he
gained
her
side
the
little
court
about
lady
bramfell
was
left
well
in
the
rear
the
great
throng
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
was
not
yet
reached
and
for
the
moment
they
were
practically
alone
there
was
a
certain
uneasiness
in
that
moment
of
companionship
it
seemed
to
him
that
eve
wished
to
speak
but
hesitated
once
or
twice
she
opened
and
closed
the
fan
that
she
was
carrying
then
at
last
as
if
by
an
effort
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
why
were
you
so
cold
to
bobby
blessington
she
asked
does
it
seem
discourteous
to
ignore
him
as
you
did
her
manner
was
subdued
it
was
not
the
annoyed
manner
that
one
uses
to
a
man
when
he
has
behaved
ill
it
was
the
explanatory
tone
one
might
adopt
towards
an
incorrigible
child
loder
felt
this
but
the
gist
of
a
remark
always
came
to
him
first
its
mode
of
expression
later
the
fact
that
it
was
blessington
whom
he
had
encountered
blessington
to
whom
he
had
spoken
with
vague
politeness
came
to
him
with
a
sense
of
unpleasantness
he
was
not
to
blame
in
the
matter
nevertheless
he
blamed
himself
he
was
annoyed
that
he
should
have
made
the
slip
in
eve
presence
they
were
moving
forward
nearing
the
press
of
people
in
the
second
room
when
eve
spoke
and
the
fact
filled
him
with
an
added
sense
of
annoyance
people
smiled
and
bowed
to
her
from
every
side
one
woman
leaned
forward
as
they
passed
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
again
the
sensation
of
futility
and
vexation
filled
him
again
he
realized
how
palpable
was
the
place
she
held
in
the
world
then
as
his
feelings
reached
their
height
and
speech
seemed
forced
upon
him
a
small
man
with
a
round
face
catching
a
glimpse
of
eve
darted
from
a
circle
of
people
gathered
in
one
of
the
windows
and
came
quickly
towards
them
with
an
unjust
touch
of
irritation
he
recognized
lord
bramfell
again
the
sense
of
eve
aloofness
stung
him
as
their
host
approached
in
another
moment
she
would
be
lost
to
him
among
this
throng
of
strangers
claimed
by
them
as
by
right
eve
he
said
involuntarily
and
under
his
breath
she
half
paused
and
turned
towards
him
yes
she
said
and
he
wondered
if
it
was
his
imagination
that
made
the
word
sound
slightly
eager
about
that
matter
of
blessington
he
began
then
he
stopped
bramfell
had
reached
them
the
little
man
came
up
smiling
and
with
an
outstretched
hand
no
penalty
for
separating
husband
and
wife
is
there
chilcote
how
are
you
chilcote
he
turned
from
one
to
the
other
with
the
quick
noiseless
manner
that
always
characterized
him
loder
turned
aside
to
hide
his
vexation
but
eve
greeted
their
host
with
her
usual
smile
you
are
exempt
from
all
penalties
she
said
then
she
turned
to
greet
the
members
of
his
party
who
had
strolled
across
from
the
window
in
his
wake
as
she
moved
aside
bramfell
looked
at
loder
well
chilcote
have
you
dipped
into
the
future
yet
he
asked
with
a
laugh
loder
echoed
the
laugh
but
said
nothing
in
his
uncertainty
at
the
question
he
reverted
to
his
old
resource
of
silence
bramfell
raised
his
eyebrows
what
he
said
do
tell
me
that
my
has
engaged
you
as
a
then
he
turned
in
direction
you
heard
of
our
new
departure
chilcote
eve
looked
round
from
the
lively
group
by
which
she
was
surrounded
lillian
why
of
course
she
said
she
should
make
a
very
beautiful
seer
we
are
all
quite
bramfell
pursed
up
his
lips
she
has
a
very
beautiful
tent
at
the
end
of
the
conservatory
it
took
five
men
as
many
days
to
rig
it
up
we
could
hear
ourselves
talk
for
hammering
my
wife
said
it
made
her
feel
quite
philanthropic
it
reminded
her
so
much
of
a
charity
everybody
laughed
and
at
the
same
moment
blessington
came
quickly
across
the
room
and
joined
the
group
hallo
he
said
anybody
seen
witcheston
he
next
on
my
list
for
the
crystal
again
the
whole
party
laughed
and
bramfell
stepping
forward
touched
blessington
arm
in
mock
seriousness
witcheston
is
playing
bridge
like
a
sensible
man
he
said
leave
him
in
peace
blessington
made
a
comical
grimace
but
i
working
this
on
commercial
principles
he
said
i
keep
the
list
names
and
hours
complete
and
lady
astrupp
gazes
in
blissful
ignorance
as
to
who
her
victims
are
the
whole
thing
is
great
simple
and
for
goodness
sake
bobby
shut
up
bramfell
round
eyes
were
twinkling
with
amusement
but
my
system
systems
ah
we
all
had
them
when
we
were
as
young
as
you
are
and
they
all
had
flaws
bobby
eve
broke
in
we
were
always
finding
gaps
that
had
to
be
filled
up
never
mind
about
lord
witcheston
get
a
substitute
it
wo
count
if
lillian
does
blessington
wavered
as
she
spoke
his
eyes
wandered
round
the
party
and
again
rested
on
bramfell
not
me
bobby
remember
i
breathed
crystals
practically
lived
on
them
for
the
last
week
now
there
chilcote
again
his
eyes
twinkled
all
eyes
were
turned
on
loder
though
one
or
two
strayed
surreptitiously
to
eve
she
seeming
sensitive
to
the
position
laughed
quickly
a
very
good
idea
she
said
who
wants
to
see
the
future
if
not
a
politician
loder
glanced
from
her
to
blessington
then
with
a
very
feminine
impulse
she
settled
the
matter
beyond
dispute
please
use
your
authority
bobby
she
said
and
when
you
got
him
safely
under
canvas
come
back
to
me
it
years
since
we
had
a
she
nodded
and
smiled
then
instantly
turned
to
bramfell
with
some
trivial
remark
for
a
second
loder
waited
then
with
a
movement
of
resignation
he
laid
his
hand
on
blessington
arm
very
well
he
said
but
if
my
fate
is
black
witness
it
was
my
wife
who
sent
me
to
his
faint
pause
on
the
word
wife
the
mention
of
the
word
itself
in
the
presence
of
these
people
had
a
savor
of
recklessness
the
small
discomfiture
of
his
earlier
slip
vanished
before
it
he
experienced
a
strong
reaction
of
confidence
in
his
luck
with
a
cool
head
a
steady
step
and
a
friendly
pressure
of
the
fingers
on
blessington
arm
he
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
across
the
through
the
long
corridors
and
down
the
broad
flight
of
steps
that
led
to
the
conservatory
the
conservatory
was
a
feature
of
the
bramfell
townhouse
and
to
loder
it
came
as
something
wonderful
and
with
its
clustering
green
branches
its
slight
unoppressive
scents
its
temperately
pleasant
atmosphere
he
felt
no
wish
to
speak
as
still
guided
by
blessington
he
passed
down
the
shadowy
paths
that
in
the
had
the
warmth
and
mystery
of
a
southern
garden
here
and
there
from
the
darkness
came
the
whispering
of
a
voice
or
the
sound
of
a
laugh
bringing
with
them
the
necessary
touch
of
life
otherwise
the
place
was
still
absorbed
by
the
air
of
solitude
contrasting
so
remarkably
with
the
noise
and
crowded
glitter
left
behind
in
the
he
had
moved
down
the
long
green
aisle
before
the
business
in
hand
came
back
to
him
with
a
sudden
sense
of
annoyance
it
seemed
so
paltry
to
mar
the
quiet
of
the
place
with
the
absurdity
of
a
he
turned
to
blessington
with
a
touch
of
abruptness
what
am
i
expected
to
do
he
asked
blessington
looked
up
surprised
why
i
thought
sir
he
began
then
he
instantly
altered
his
tone
oh
just
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
lady
astrupp
wo
put
much
strain
on
your
credulity
but
make
a
big
call
on
your
he
laughed
he
had
an
infectious
laugh
and
loder
responded
to
it
but
what
am
i
to
do
he
persisted
oh
nothing
being
the
priestess
she
naturally
demands
acolytes
but
she
let
you
know
that
she
holds
the
prior
place
the
tent
is
so
fixed
that
she
sees
nothing
beyond
your
hands
so
there
absolutely
no
he
laughed
once
more
then
suddenly
he
lowered
his
voice
and
slackened
his
steps
here
we
are
he
whispered
in
pretended
awe
at
the
end
of
the
path
the
space
widened
to
the
full
breadth
of
the
conservatory
the
light
was
dimmer
giving
an
added
impression
of
distance
away
to
the
left
loder
heard
the
sound
of
splashing
water
and
on
his
right
hand
he
caught
his
first
glimpse
of
the
tent
that
was
his
goal
it
was
an
artistic
little
structure
a
pavilion
formed
of
silky
fabric
that
showed
bronze
in
the
light
of
an
oriental
lamp
that
hung
above
its
entrance
as
they
drew
closer
a
man
emerged
from
it
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
uncertainty
looking
about
him
then
catching
sight
of
them
he
came
forward
laughing
by
george
he
exclaimed
it
as
dark
as
limbo
in
there
i
did
see
you
at
first
but
i
say
blessington
it
a
beastly
shame
to
have
that
barrier
shutting
off
the
sorceress
if
she
gazes
at
the
crystal
may
we
have
something
to
gaze
at
too
blessington
laughed
you
want
too
much
galltry
he
said
lady
astrupp
understands
the
value
of
the
unattainable
come
along
sir
he
added
to
loder
drawing
him
forward
with
an
energetic
pressure
of
the
arm
loder
responded
and
as
he
did
so
a
flicker
of
curiosity
touched
his
mind
for
the
first
time
he
wondered
for
an
instant
who
this
woman
was
who
aroused
so
much
comment
and
with
the
speculation
came
the
remembrance
of
how
she
had
assured
chilcote
that
on
one
point
at
least
he
was
invulnerable
he
had
spoken
then
from
the
height
of
a
past
experience
an
experience
so
fully
passed
that
he
wondered
now
if
it
had
been
as
staple
a
guarantee
as
he
had
then
believed
man
capacity
for
outliving
is
astonishingly
complete
the
incident
in
the
italian
mountains
had
faded
like
a
crayon
study
in
which
the
tones
have
merged
and
gradually
lost
character
the
past
had
paled
before
the
present
as
golden
hair
might
pale
before
black
the
simile
came
with
apparent
irrelevance
then
again
blessington
pressed
his
arm
now
sir
he
said
drawing
away
and
lifting
the
curtain
that
hung
before
the
entrance
of
the
tent
loder
looked
at
the
amused
boyish
face
lighted
by
the
hanging
lamp
and
smiled
pleasantly
then
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
entered
the
pavilion
and
the
curtain
fell
behind
him
xv
on
entering
the
pavilion
loder
first
feeling
was
one
of
annoyed
awkwardness
at
finding
himself
in
almost
total
darkness
but
as
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
gloom
the
feeling
vanished
and
the
absurdity
of
the
position
came
to
his
mind
the
tent
was
small
heavily
draped
with
silk
and
smelling
of
musk
it
was
divided
into
two
sections
by
an
immovable
curtain
that
hung
from
the
roof
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
floor
the
only
furniture
on
side
was
one
low
chair
and
the
only
light
a
faint
radiance
that
coming
from
the
invisible
half
of
the
pavilion
spread
across
the
floor
in
a
pale
band
for
a
short
space
he
stood
uncertain
then
his
hesitation
was
brought
to
an
end
please
sit
down
said
a
low
soft
voice
for
a
further
moment
he
stood
undecided
the
voice
sounded
so
unexpectedly
near
in
the
quiet
and
darkness
of
the
place
it
seemed
to
possess
a
disproportionate
weight
almost
the
weight
of
a
familiar
thing
then
with
a
sudden
unanalyzed
touch
of
relief
he
located
the
impression
it
was
the
similarity
to
lady
bramfell
sweet
slow
tones
that
had
stirred
his
mind
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
he
drew
the
chair
forward
and
sat
down
then
for
the
first
time
he
saw
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
gauze
partition
and
below
it
by
a
few
inches
was
a
small
table
of
polished
wood
on
which
stood
an
open
book
a
crystal
ball
and
a
gold
dish
filled
with
ink
these
were
arranged
on
the
side
of
the
table
nearest
to
him
the
farther
side
being
out
of
his
range
of
vision
an
amused
interest
touched
him
as
he
made
his
position
more
comfortable
whoever
this
woman
was
she
had
an
eye
for
stage
management
she
knew
how
to
marshal
her
effects
he
found
himself
waiting
with
some
curiosity
for
the
next
injunction
from
behind
the
curtain
the
art
of
began
the
sweet
slow
voice
after
a
pause
is
one
of
the
oldest
known
loder
sat
forward
the
thought
of
lady
bramfell
mingled
disconcertingly
with
some
other
thought
more
distant
and
less
easy
to
secure
to
obtain
the
best
results
went
on
the
seer
the
subject
lays
his
uncovered
hands
outspread
upon
a
smooth
it
was
evident
that
the
invisible
priestess
was
reading
from
the
open
book
for
when
the
word
surface
was
reached
there
was
a
slight
stir
that
indicated
the
changing
of
position
and
when
the
voice
came
again
it
was
in
a
different
tone
please
lay
your
hands
palms
downward
upon
the
loder
smiled
to
himself
in
the
darkness
he
pictured
chilcote
with
his
nerves
and
his
impatience
going
through
this
ordeal
then
in
silence
he
leaned
forward
and
obeyed
the
command
his
hands
rested
on
the
smooth
surface
of
the
table
in
the
bar
of
light
from
the
unseen
lamp
there
was
a
second
in
which
the
seer
was
silent
then
he
fancied
that
she
raised
her
head
you
must
take
off
your
rings
she
said
smoothly
any
metal
interferes
with
the
sympathetic
at
any
other
time
loder
would
have
laughed
but
the
request
so
casually
and
graciously
made
sent
all
possibility
of
irony
far
into
the
background
the
thought
of
chilcote
and
of
the
one
flaw
in
their
otherwise
flawless
scheme
rose
to
his
mind
instinctively
he
half
withdrew
his
hands
where
is
the
sympathetic
current
he
asked
quietly
his
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
question
of
whether
he
would
or
would
not
be
justified
in
beating
an
undignified
retreat
between
you
and
me
of
course
said
the
voice
softly
it
sounded
languid
but
very
rational
the
idea
of
retreat
seemed
suddenly
theatrical
in
this
world
of
low
voices
and
shaded
lights
people
never
adopted
extreme
measures
no
occasion
made
a
scene
practicable
or
even
allowable
he
leaned
back
slowly
while
he
summed
up
the
situation
if
by
any
unlucky
chance
this
woman
knew
chilcote
to
have
adopted
jewelry
and
had
seen
the
designs
of
his
rings
the
sight
of
his
own
scarred
finger
would
suggest
question
and
comment
if
on
the
other
hand
he
left
the
pavilion
without
excuse
or
if
without
apparent
reason
he
refused
to
remove
the
rings
he
opened
up
a
new
difficulty
a
fresh
road
to
curiosity
it
came
upon
him
with
unusual
quickness
the
obstacles
to
and
the
need
for
a
speedy
decision
he
glanced
round
the
tent
then
unconsciously
he
straightened
his
shoulders
after
all
he
had
stepped
into
a
tight
corner
but
there
was
no
need
to
cry
out
in
squeezing
his
way
back
then
he
realized
that
the
soft
ingratiating
tones
were
sounding
once
more
it
the
passing
of
my
hands
over
yours
while
i
look
into
the
crystal
that
sets
up
sympathy
a
slender
hand
moved
swiftly
into
the
light
and
picked
up
the
ball
and
makes
my
eyes
see
the
pictures
in
your
mind
now
will
you
please
take
off
your
rings
the
very
naturalness
of
the
request
disarmed
him
it
was
a
risk
but
as
chilcote
had
said
risk
was
the
salt
of
life
i
afraid
you
think
me
very
the
voice
came
again
delicately
low
and
conciliatory
for
a
brief
second
loder
wondered
uncertainly
how
long
or
how
well
chilcote
knew
lady
astrupp
then
he
dismissed
the
question
chilcote
had
never
mentioned
her
until
and
then
casually
as
lady
sister
what
a
coward
he
was
becoming
in
throwing
the
dice
with
fate
without
further
delay
he
drew
off
the
rings
slipped
them
into
his
pocket
and
replaced
his
hands
on
the
smooth
then
at
the
moment
that
he
replaced
them
a
peculiar
thing
occurred
from
the
farther
side
of
the
dark
partition
came
the
quick
rustling
stir
of
a
skirt
and
the
slight
scrape
of
a
chair
pushed
either
backward
or
forward
then
there
was
silence
now
silence
can
suggest
anything
from
profound
thought
to
imbecility
but
in
this
case
its
suggestion
was
nil
that
something
had
happened
that
some
change
had
taken
place
was
as
patent
to
loder
as
the
darkness
of
the
curtain
or
the
band
of
light
that
crossed
the
floor
but
what
had
occasioned
it
or
what
it
stood
for
he
made
no
attempt
to
decide
he
sat
bitingly
conscious
of
his
hands
spread
open
on
the
table
under
the
scrutiny
of
eyes
that
were
invisible
to
him
vividly
aware
of
the
awkwardness
of
his
position
he
felt
with
instinctive
certainty
that
a
new
chord
had
been
struck
but
a
man
seldom
acts
on
instinctive
certainties
if
the
exposure
of
his
hands
had
struck
this
fresh
note
then
any
added
action
would
but
heighten
the
dilemma
he
sat
silent
and
motionless
whether
his
impassivity
had
any
bearing
on
the
moment
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
but
no
further
movement
came
from
behind
the
partition
whatever
the
emotions
that
had
caused
the
sharp
swish
of
skirts
and
the
sharp
scrape
of
the
chair
they
had
evidently
subsided
or
been
dominated
by
other
feelings
the
next
indication
of
life
that
came
to
him
was
the
laying
down
of
the
crystal
ball
it
was
laid
back
upon
the
table
with
a
slight
jerk
that
indicated
a
decision
come
to
and
almost
simultaneously
the
seer
voice
came
to
him
again
her
tone
was
lower
now
than
it
had
been
before
and
its
extreme
ease
seemed
slightly
shaken
whether
by
excitement
surprise
or
curiosity
it
was
impossible
to
say
you
will
think
it
strange
she
began
you
will
think
then
she
stopped
there
was
a
pause
as
though
she
waited
for
some
help
but
loder
remained
mute
in
difficulty
a
silent
tongue
and
a
cool
head
are
usually
man
best
weapons
his
silence
was
disconcerting
he
heard
her
stir
again
you
will
think
it
strange
she
began
once
more
then
quite
suddenly
she
checked
and
controlled
her
voice
you
must
forgive
me
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
she
added
in
a
completely
different
tone
but
is
such
an
illusive
thing
directly
you
put
your
hands
upon
the
table
i
felt
that
there
would
be
no
result
but
i
admit
the
defeat
women
are
such
keen
anglers
that
they
can
never
acknowledge
that
any
fish
however
big
has
slipped
the
she
laughed
softly
at
the
sound
of
the
laugh
loder
shifted
his
position
for
the
first
time
he
could
not
have
told
why
but
it
struck
him
with
a
slight
sense
of
confusion
a
precipitate
wish
to
rise
and
pass
through
the
doorway
into
the
wider
spaces
of
the
conservatory
came
to
him
though
he
made
no
attempt
to
act
upon
it
he
knew
that
for
some
inexplicable
reason
this
woman
behind
the
screen
had
lied
to
him
in
the
controlling
of
her
speech
in
her
charge
of
voice
there
had
been
one
moment
in
which
an
impulse
or
an
emotion
had
almost
found
voice
then
training
instinct
or
it
might
have
been
diplomacy
had
conquered
and
the
moment
had
passed
there
was
a
riddle
in
the
very
atmosphere
of
the
place
and
he
abominated
riddles
but
lady
astrupp
was
absorbed
in
her
own
concerns
again
she
changed
her
position
and
to
loder
listening
attentively
it
seemed
that
she
leaned
forward
and
examined
his
hands
afresh
the
sensation
was
so
acute
that
he
withdrew
them
involuntarily
again
there
was
a
confused
rustle
the
crystal
ball
rolled
from
the
table
and
the
seer
laughed
quickly
obeying
a
strenuous
impulse
loder
rose
he
had
no
definite
notion
of
what
he
expected
or
what
he
must
avoid
he
was
only
conscious
that
the
pavilion
with
its
silk
draperies
its
scent
of
musk
and
its
intolerable
secrecy
was
no
longer
endurable
he
felt
cramped
and
confused
in
mind
and
muscle
he
stood
for
a
second
to
straighten
his
limbs
then
he
turned
and
moving
directly
forward
passed
through
the
portiere
after
the
dimness
of
the
pavilion
the
conservatory
seemed
comparatively
bright
but
without
waiting
to
grow
accustomed
to
the
altered
light
he
moved
onward
with
deliberate
haste
the
long
green
alley
was
speedily
traversed
in
his
eyes
it
no
longer
possessed
greenness
no
longer
suggested
freshness
or
repose
it
was
simply
a
means
to
the
end
upon
which
his
mind
was
set
as
he
passed
up
the
flight
of
steps
he
drew
his
rings
from
his
pocket
and
slipped
them
on
again
then
he
stepped
into
the
glare
of
the
thronged
corridor
some
one
hailed
him
as
he
passed
through
the
crowd
but
with
most
absorbed
manner
he
hurried
on
through
the
door
of
the
he
caught
sight
of
blessington
and
eve
and
then
for
the
first
time
his
expression
changed
and
he
turned
directly
towards
them
eve
he
said
will
you
excuse
me
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
she
glanced
at
him
in
momentary
surprise
then
she
smiled
in
her
quiet
way
of
course
she
said
i
been
wanting
a
chat
with
millicent
gower
but
bobby
has
required
so
much
entertaining
she
smiled
again
this
time
at
blessington
and
moved
away
towards
a
pale
girl
in
green
who
was
standing
alone
instantly
she
had
turned
loder
took
blessington
arm
i
know
you
tremendously
busy
he
began
in
an
excellent
imitation
of
chilcote
hasty
manner
i
know
you
tremendously
busy
but
in
a
one
glance
at
blessington
healthy
ingenuous
face
told
him
that
plain
speaking
was
the
method
to
adopt
indeed
sir
in
a
moment
blessington
was
on
the
alert
yes
and
i
i
want
your
the
boy
reddened
that
chilcote
should
appeal
to
him
stirred
him
to
an
uneasy
feeling
of
pride
and
uncertainty
loder
saw
his
advantage
and
pressed
it
home
it
come
about
through
this
business
i
afraid
i
did
play
my
part
rather
made
an
ass
of
myself
i
would
swallow
the
thing
and
and
lady
astrupp
he
paused
measuring
blessington
with
a
glance
well
my
dear
boy
you
you
know
what
women
are
blessington
was
only
he
reddened
again
and
assumed
an
air
of
profundity
i
know
sir
he
said
with
a
shake
of
the
head
loder
sense
of
humor
was
keen
but
he
kept
a
grave
face
i
knew
catch
my
meaning
but
i
want
you
to
do
something
more
if
lady
astrupp
should
ask
you
who
was
in
her
tent
this
past
ten
minutes
i
want
you
again
he
stopped
looking
at
his
companion
face
yes
sir
i
want
you
to
tell
an
immaterial
lie
for
blessington
returned
his
glance
then
he
laughed
a
little
uncomfortably
but
surely
sir
she
recognized
me
you
mean
loder
eyes
were
as
keen
as
steel
then
you
wrong
she
blessington
eyebrows
went
up
there
was
silence
loder
glanced
across
the
room
eve
had
parted
from
the
girl
in
green
and
was
moving
towards
them
exchanging
smiles
and
greetings
as
she
came
my
wife
is
coming
back
he
said
will
you
do
this
for
me
blessington
it
it
will
smooth
things
he
spoke
quickly
continuing
to
watch
eve
as
he
had
hoped
blessington
eyes
turned
in
the
same
direction
smooth
matters
he
repeated
smooth
them
in
in
a
domestic
way
that
i
ca
the
shot
told
blessington
looked
round
right
sir
he
said
you
may
leave
it
to
me
and
before
loder
could
speak
again
he
had
turned
and
disappeared
into
the
crowd
xvi
his
business
with
blessington
over
loder
breathed
more
freely
if
lady
astrupp
had
recognized
chilcote
by
the
rings
and
had
been
roused
to
curiosity
the
incident
would
demand
settlement
sooner
or
later
settlement
in
what
proportion
he
could
hazard
no
guess
if
on
the
other
hand
her
obvious
change
of
manner
had
arisen
from
any
other
source
he
had
a
hazy
idea
that
a
woman
behavior
could
never
be
gauged
by
accepted
theories
then
he
had
safeguarded
chilcote
interests
and
his
own
by
his
securing
of
blessington
promise
blessington
he
knew
would
be
reliable
and
discreet
with
a
renewal
of
confidence
a
pleasant
feeling
that
his
uneasiness
had
been
groundless
he
moved
forward
to
greet
eve
her
face
with
its
rich
clear
coloring
seemed
to
his
gaze
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
of
other
faces
as
from
a
frame
and
a
sense
of
pride
touched
him
in
every
eye
but
his
own
her
beauty
belonged
to
him
his
face
looked
alive
and
masterful
as
she
reached
his
side
may
i
monopolize
you
he
said
with
the
quickness
of
speech
borrowed
from
chilcote
we
see
so
little
of
each
almost
as
if
compelled
her
lashes
lifted
and
her
eyes
met
his
her
glance
was
puzzled
uncertain
slightly
confused
there
was
a
deeper
color
than
usual
in
her
cheeks
loder
felt
something
within
his
own
consciousness
stir
in
response
you
know
you
are
yielding
he
said
again
she
blushed
he
saw
the
blush
and
knew
that
it
was
he
his
words
his
personality
that
had
called
it
forth
in
chilcote
actual
semblance
he
had
proved
his
superiority
over
chilcote
for
the
first
time
he
had
been
given
a
tacit
personal
acknowledgment
of
his
power
involuntarily
he
drew
nearer
to
her
let
get
out
of
this
she
made
no
answer
except
to
bend
her
head
and
it
came
to
him
that
for
all
her
pride
she
liked
and
unconsciously
yielded
to
domination
with
a
satisfied
gesture
he
turned
to
make
a
passage
towards
the
door
but
the
passage
was
more
easily
desired
than
made
in
the
few
moments
since
he
had
entered
the
the
press
of
people
had
considerably
thickened
until
a
block
had
formed
about
the
drawing
eve
with
him
he
moved
forward
for
a
dozen
paces
then
paused
unable
to
make
further
headway
as
they
stood
there
he
looked
back
at
her
what
a
study
in
democracy
a
crowd
always
is
he
said
she
responded
with
a
bright
appreciative
glance
as
if
surprised
into
naturalness
he
wondered
sharply
what
she
would
be
like
if
her
enthusiasms
were
really
aroused
then
a
stir
in
the
corridor
outside
caused
a
movement
inside
the
room
and
with
a
certain
display
of
persistence
he
was
enabled
to
make
a
passage
to
the
door
there
again
they
were
compelled
to
halt
but
though
tightly
wedged
into
his
new
position
and
guarding
eve
with
one
arm
loder
was
free
to
survey
the
brilliantly
thronged
corridor
over
the
head
of
a
man
a
few
inches
shorter
than
himself
who
stood
directly
in
front
of
him
what
are
we
waiting
for
he
asked
good
humoredly
addressing
the
back
of
the
stranger
head
the
man
turned
displaying
a
genial
face
a
red
mustache
and
an
hullo
chilcote
he
said
hope
it
not
on
your
feet
i
loder
laughed
no
he
said
and
do
change
the
position
if
you
were
an
inch
higher
i
should
be
blind
as
well
as
the
other
laughed
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
to
find
chilcote
amiable
under
discomfort
he
looked
round
again
in
slight
curiosity
loder
felt
the
scrutiny
to
create
a
diversion
he
looked
out
along
the
corridor
i
believe
we
are
waiting
for
something
he
exclaimed
what
this
then
quite
abruptly
be
ceased
to
speak
anything
interesting
eve
touched
his
arm
he
said
nothing
he
made
no
effort
to
look
round
his
thought
as
well
as
his
speech
was
suddenly
suspended
the
man
in
front
of
him
let
his
fall
from
his
eye
then
screwed
it
in
again
jove
he
exclaimed
here
comes
our
sorceress
it
like
the
progress
of
a
fairy
princess
i
believe
this
is
the
meaning
of
our
getting
penned
in
here
he
chuckled
delightedly
loder
said
nothing
he
stared
straight
on
over
the
other
head
along
the
corridor
agreeably
conscious
of
the
hum
of
admiration
she
aroused
came
lillian
astrupp
surrounded
by
a
little
court
her
delicate
face
was
lit
up
her
eyes
shone
under
the
faint
gleam
of
her
hair
her
gown
of
gold
embroidery
swept
round
her
gracefully
she
was
radiant
and
triumphant
but
she
was
also
excited
the
excitement
was
evident
in
her
laugh
in
her
gestures
in
her
eyes
as
they
turned
quickly
in
one
direction
and
then
another
loder
gazing
in
stupefaction
over
the
other
man
head
saw
it
felt
and
understood
it
with
a
mind
that
leaped
back
over
a
space
of
years
as
in
a
shifting
panorama
he
saw
a
night
of
disturbance
and
confusion
in
a
italian
valley
a
confusion
from
which
one
face
shone
out
with
something
of
the
pale
alluring
radiance
that
filtered
over
the
hillside
from
the
crescent
moon
it
passed
across
his
consciousness
slowly
but
with
a
slow
completeness
and
in
its
light
the
incidents
of
the
past
hour
stood
out
in
a
new
aspect
the
echo
of
recollection
stirred
by
lady
bramfell
voice
the
of
it
in
the
sister
tones
his
own
blindness
his
own
egregious
assurance
all
struck
across
his
mind
meanwhile
the
party
about
lillian
drew
nearer
he
felt
with
instinctive
certainty
that
the
was
its
destination
but
he
remained
motionless
held
by
a
species
of
fatalism
he
watched
her
draw
near
with
an
unmoved
face
but
in
the
brief
space
that
passed
while
she
traversed
the
corridor
he
gauged
to
the
full
the
hold
that
the
new
atmosphere
the
new
existence
had
gained
over
his
mind
with
an
rush
of
feeling
he
realized
how
dearly
he
would
part
with
it
as
lillian
came
closer
the
meaning
of
her
manner
became
clearer
to
him
she
talked
incessantly
laughing
now
and
then
but
her
eyes
were
never
quiet
these
skimmed
the
length
of
the
corridor
then
glanced
over
the
heads
crowded
in
the
i
have
something
quite
sweet
geoffrey
she
was
saying
to
the
man
beside
her
as
she
came
within
hearing
you
know
what
i
like
a
sort
of
snowflake
wrapped
up
in
as
she
said
the
words
her
glance
wandered
loder
saw
it
rest
uninterestedly
on
a
boy
a
yard
or
two
in
front
of
him
then
move
to
the
man
over
whose
head
he
gazed
then
lift
itself
inevitably
to
his
face
the
glance
was
quick
and
direct
he
saw
the
look
of
recognition
spring
across
it
he
saw
her
move
forward
suddenly
as
the
crowd
in
the
corridor
parted
to
let
her
pass
then
he
saw
what
seemed
to
him
a
miracle
her
whole
expression
altered
her
lips
parted
and
she
colored
with
annoyance
she
looked
like
a
spoiled
child
who
seeing
a
opens
it
to
find
it
empty
as
the
press
about
the
melted
to
give
her
passage
the
man
in
front
of
loder
was
the
first
to
take
advantage
of
the
space
jove
lillian
he
said
moving
forward
you
look
as
if
you
expected
chilcote
to
be
somebody
else
and
are
disappointed
to
find
only
himself
he
laughed
delightedly
at
his
own
joke
the
words
were
exactly
the
tonic
that
lillian
needed
she
smiled
her
usual
undisturbed
smile
as
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
my
dear
leonard
you
using
your
when
that
happens
never
responsible
for
what
you
her
words
came
more
slowly
and
with
a
touch
of
languid
amusement
her
composure
was
suddenly
restored
then
for
the
first
time
loder
changed
his
position
moved
by
an
impulse
he
made
no
effort
to
dissect
he
stepped
back
to
eve
side
and
slipped
his
arm
through
hers
successfully
concealing
his
left
hand
the
warmth
of
her
skin
through
her
long
glove
thrilled
him
unexpectedly
his
impulse
had
been
one
of
but
the
result
was
of
a
different
character
at
the
quick
contact
the
wish
to
fight
for
to
hold
and
defend
the
position
that
had
grown
so
dear
woke
in
renewed
force
with
a
new
determination
he
turned
again
towards
lillian
i
caught
the
same
impression
without
an
eyeglass
he
said
why
did
you
look
like
that
he
asked
the
question
steadily
and
with
apparent
carelessness
though
through
it
all
his
reason
stood
aghast
his
cried
aloud
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
eyes
that
had
seen
his
face
in
admiration
in
love
in
contempt
to
fail
now
in
recognition
the
air
seemed
breathless
while
he
spoke
and
waited
his
impression
of
lillian
was
a
mere
shimmering
of
gold
dress
and
gold
hair
all
that
he
was
really
conscious
of
was
the
pressure
of
his
hand
on
eve
arm
and
the
warmth
of
her
skin
through
the
soft
glove
then
abruptly
the
mist
lifted
he
saw
lillian
eyes
indifferent
amused
slightly
contemptuous
and
a
second
later
he
heard
her
voice
my
dear
jack
she
said
sweetly
how
absurd
of
you
it
was
simply
the
contrast
of
your
eyes
peering
over
leonard
hair
it
was
like
a
gorgeous
sunset
with
a
black
cloud
she
laughed
do
you
see
what
i
mean
eve
she
affected
to
see
eve
for
the
first
time
eve
had
been
looking
calmly
ahead
she
turned
now
and
smiled
serenely
loder
felt
no
vibration
of
the
arm
he
held
yet
by
an
instant
intuition
he
knew
that
the
two
women
were
antagonistic
he
experienced
it
with
the
divination
that
follows
upon
a
moment
of
acute
suspense
he
understood
it
as
he
had
understood
lillian
look
of
recognition
when
his
forehead
eyes
and
nose
had
shown
him
to
be
himself
her
blank
surprise
when
his
lip
and
chin
had
proclaimed
him
chilcote
he
felt
like
a
man
who
has
looked
into
an
abyss
and
stepped
back
from
the
edge
outwardly
calm
but
mentally
shaken
the
commonplaces
of
life
seemed
for
the
moment
to
hold
deeper
meanings
he
did
not
hear
answer
he
paid
no
heed
to
lillian
next
remark
he
saw
her
smile
and
turn
to
the
man
finally
he
saw
her
move
on
into
the
followed
by
her
little
court
then
he
pressed
the
arm
he
was
still
holding
he
felt
an
urgent
need
of
companionship
of
a
human
expression
to
the
crisis
he
had
passed
shall
we
get
out
of
this
he
asked
again
eve
looked
up
out
of
the
room
she
said
he
looked
down
at
her
compelling
her
gaze
out
of
the
room
and
the
house
he
answered
let
us
xvii
the
necessary
formalities
of
departure
were
speedily
got
through
the
passing
of
the
corridors
the
gaining
of
the
carriage
seemed
to
loder
to
be
marvellously
simple
proceedings
then
as
he
sat
by
eve
side
and
again
felt
the
forward
movement
of
the
horses
he
had
leisure
for
the
first
time
to
wonder
whether
the
time
that
had
passed
since
last
he
occupied
that
position
had
actually
been
lived
through
only
that
night
he
had
unconsciously
compared
one
incident
in
his
life
to
a
sketch
in
which
the
lights
and
shadows
have
been
obliterated
and
lost
now
that
picture
rose
before
him
startlingly
and
incredibly
intact
he
saw
the
sunlit
houses
of
santasalare
backgrounded
by
the
sunlit
hills
saw
them
as
plainly
as
when
he
himself
had
sketched
them
on
his
memory
every
detail
of
the
scene
remained
the
same
even
to
the
central
figure
only
the
eye
and
the
hand
of
the
artist
had
changed
at
this
point
eve
broke
in
upon
his
thoughts
her
first
words
were
curiously
coincidental
what
did
you
think
of
lillian
astrupp
she
asked
was
her
gown
perfect
loder
lifted
his
head
with
an
almost
guilty
start
then
he
answered
straight
from
his
thoughts
i
i
did
notice
it
he
said
but
her
eyes
reminded
me
of
a
cat
eyes
and
she
walks
like
a
cat
i
never
seemed
to
see
it
until
eve
changed
her
position
she
was
very
artistic
she
said
tentatively
do
you
think
the
gold
gown
was
beautiful
with
her
hair
loder
felt
surprised
he
was
convinced
that
eve
disliked
the
other
and
he
was
not
sufficiently
versed
in
women
to
understand
her
praise
i
thought
he
began
then
he
wisely
stopped
i
did
see
the
gown
he
substituted
eve
looked
out
of
the
window
how
unappreciative
men
are
she
said
but
her
tone
was
strangely
free
from
censure
after
this
there
was
silence
until
grosvenor
square
was
reached
having
left
the
carriage
and
passed
into
the
house
eve
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
to
give
an
order
to
crapham
who
was
still
in
attendance
in
the
hall
and
again
loder
had
an
opportunity
of
studying
her
as
he
looked
a
sharp
comparison
rose
to
his
mind
a
fairy
princess
he
had
heard
the
man
say
as
lillian
astrupp
came
into
view
along
the
bramfells
corridor
and
the
simile
had
seemed
particularly
apt
with
her
grace
her
delicacy
her
subtle
attraction
she
might
well
be
the
outcome
of
imagination
but
with
eve
it
was
different
she
also
was
graceful
and
attractive
but
it
was
grace
and
attraction
of
a
different
order
one
was
beautiful
with
the
beauty
of
the
white
rose
that
springs
from
the
and
withers
at
the
first
touch
of
cold
the
other
with
the
beauty
of
the
wild
rose
on
the
cliffs
above
the
sea
that
keeps
its
petals
fine
and
transparent
in
face
of
salt
spray
and
wet
mist
eve
too
had
her
realm
but
it
was
the
realm
of
real
things
a
great
confidence
a
feeling
that
here
one
might
rely
even
if
all
other
faiths
were
shaken
touched
him
suddenly
for
a
moment
he
stood
irresolute
watching
her
mount
the
stairs
with
her
easy
assured
step
then
a
determination
came
to
him
fate
favored
him
he
was
in
luck
tonight
he
would
put
his
fortune
to
one
more
test
he
swung
across
the
hall
and
ran
up
the
stairs
his
face
was
keen
with
interest
as
he
reached
her
side
the
hard
outline
of
his
features
and
the
hard
grayness
of
his
eyes
were
softened
as
when
he
had
paused
to
talk
with
lakely
action
was
the
breath
of
his
life
and
his
face
changed
under
it
as
another
might
change
under
the
influence
of
stirring
music
or
good
wine
eve
saw
the
look
and
again
the
uneasy
expression
of
surprise
crossed
her
eyes
she
paused
her
hand
resting
on
the
banister
loder
looked
at
her
directly
will
you
come
into
the
study
as
you
came
that
other
night
there
something
i
want
to
he
spoke
quietly
he
felt
master
of
himself
and
of
her
she
hesitated
glanced
at
him
and
then
glanced
away
will
you
come
he
said
again
and
as
he
said
it
his
eyes
rested
on
the
sweep
of
her
thick
eyelashes
the
curve
of
the
black
hair
at
last
her
lashes
lifted
and
the
perplexity
and
doubt
in
her
blue
eyes
stirred
him
without
waiting
for
her
answer
he
leaned
forward
say
yes
he
urged
i
do
often
ask
for
still
she
hesitated
then
her
decision
was
made
for
her
with
a
new
boldness
he
touched
her
arm
drawing
her
forward
gently
but
decisively
towards
chilcote
rooms
in
the
study
a
fire
burned
brightly
the
desk
was
laden
with
papers
the
lights
were
nicely
adjusted
even
the
chairs
were
in
their
accustomed
places
loder
senses
responded
to
each
suggestion
it
seemed
but
a
day
since
he
had
seen
it
last
it
was
precisely
as
he
had
left
it
the
niche
needing
but
the
man
to
hide
his
emotion
he
crossed
the
floor
quickly
and
drew
a
chair
forward
in
less
than
six
hours
he
had
run
up
and
down
the
scale
of
emotions
he
had
looked
despair
in
the
face
till
the
sudden
sight
of
chilcote
had
lifted
him
to
the
skies
since
then
surprise
had
assailed
him
in
its
strongest
form
he
had
known
the
full
meaning
of
the
word
risk
and
from
every
contingency
he
had
come
out
conqueror
he
bent
over
the
chair
as
he
pulled
it
forward
to
hide
the
expression
in
his
eyes
sit
down
he
said
gently
eve
moved
towards
him
she
moved
slowly
as
if
half
afraid
many
emotions
stirred
her
distrust
uncertainty
and
a
curious
questioning
that
it
was
difficult
to
define
loder
remembered
her
shrinking
coldness
her
reluctant
tolerance
on
the
night
of
his
first
coming
and
his
individuality
his
certainty
of
power
kindled
afresh
never
had
he
been
so
vehemently
himself
never
had
chilcote
seemed
so
complete
a
shadow
as
eve
seated
herself
he
moved
forward
and
leaned
over
the
back
of
her
chair
the
impulse
that
had
filled
him
in
his
interview
with
renwick
that
had
goaded
him
as
he
drove
to
the
reception
was
dominant
again
i
tried
to
say
something
as
we
drove
to
the
bramfells
he
began
like
many
men
who
possess
eloquence
for
an
impersonal
cause
he
was
brusque
even
blunt
in
the
stating
of
his
own
case
may
i
hark
back
and
go
on
from
where
i
broke
off
eve
half
turned
her
face
was
still
puzzled
and
questioning
of
she
sat
forward
again
clasping
her
hands
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
back
of
her
head
at
the
slim
outline
of
her
shoulders
the
glitter
of
the
diamonds
about
her
neck
do
you
remember
the
day
three
weeks
ago
that
we
talked
together
in
this
room
the
day
a
great
many
things
seemed
possible
this
time
she
did
not
look
round
she
kept
her
gaze
upon
the
fire
do
you
remember
he
persisted
quietly
in
his
college
days
men
who
heard
that
tone
of
quiet
persistence
had
been
wont
to
lose
heart
eve
heard
it
now
for
the
first
time
and
without
being
aware
answered
to
it
yes
i
remember
she
said
on
that
day
you
believed
in
me
in
his
earnestness
he
no
longer
simulated
chilcote
he
spoke
with
his
own
steady
reliance
he
saw
eve
stir
unclasp
and
clasp
her
hands
but
he
went
steadily
on
on
that
day
you
saw
me
in
a
new
light
you
acknowledged
he
emphasized
the
slightly
peculiar
word
but
since
that
day
his
voice
quickened
since
that
day
your
feelings
have
changed
your
faith
in
me
has
fallen
he
watched
her
closely
but
she
made
no
sign
save
to
lean
still
nearer
to
the
fire
he
crossed
his
arms
over
the
back
of
her
chair
you
were
justified
he
said
suddenly
i
not
been
myself
since
that
as
he
said
the
words
his
coolness
forsook
him
slightly
he
loathed
the
necessary
lie
yet
his
egotism
clamored
for
vindication
all
men
have
their
lapses
he
went
on
there
are
times
there
are
days
and
weeks
when
i
when
my
the
word
nerves
touched
his
tongue
hung
upon
it
then
died
away
unspoken
very
quietly
almost
without
a
sound
eve
had
risen
and
turned
towards
him
she
was
standing
very
straight
her
face
a
little
pale
the
hand
that
rested
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
trembling
slightly
john
she
said
quickly
do
say
that
word
do
say
that
hideous
word
i
do
feel
that
i
can
bear
it
not
just
can
you
understand
loder
stepped
back
without
comprehending
he
felt
suddenly
and
strangely
at
a
loss
something
in
her
face
struck
him
silent
and
perplexed
it
seemed
that
without
preparation
he
had
stepped
upon
dangerous
ground
with
an
undefined
apprehension
he
waited
looking
at
her
i
ca
explain
it
she
went
on
with
nervous
haste
i
ca
give
any
reasons
but
quite
suddenly
the
the
farce
has
grown
unbearable
i
used
not
to
think
used
not
even
to
care
but
suddenly
things
have
changed
or
i
have
she
paused
confused
and
distressed
why
should
it
be
why
should
things
change
she
asked
the
question
sharp
ly
as
if
in
appeal
against
her
own
incredulity
loder
turned
aside
he
was
afraid
of
the
triumph
volcanic
and
irrepressible
that
her
admission
roused
why
she
said
again
he
turned
slowly
back
you
forget
that
i
not
a
magician
he
said
gently
i
hardly
know
what
you
are
speaking
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
but
in
that
moment
her
eyes
spoke
pain
distress
pride
all
strove
for
expression
then
at
last
her
lips
parted
do
you
say
that
in
seriousness
she
asked
it
was
no
moment
for
fencing
and
loder
knew
it
in
seriousness
he
replied
shortly
then
i
shall
speak
seriously
her
voice
shook
slightly
and
the
color
came
back
into
her
face
but
the
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
ceased
to
tremble
for
more
than
four
years
i
have
known
that
you
take
drugs
for
more
than
four
years
i
have
acquiesced
in
your
deceptions
in
your
meannesses
there
was
an
instant
silence
then
loder
stepped
forward
you
knew
for
four
years
he
said
very
slowly
for
the
first
time
that
night
he
remembered
chilcote
and
forgot
himself
eve
lifted
her
head
with
a
quick
gesture
as
if
in
flinging
off
discretion
and
silence
she
appreciated
to
the
full
the
new
relief
of
speech
yes
i
knew
perhaps
i
should
have
spoken
when
i
first
surprised
the
secret
but
it
all
so
past
that
it
useless
to
speculate
now
it
was
fate
i
suppose
i
was
very
young
you
were
very
unapproachable
and
and
we
had
no
love
to
make
the
way
for
a
second
her
glance
faltered
and
she
looked
away
a
woman
a
girl
disillusioning
is
a
very
sad
comedy
it
should
never
have
an
she
laughed
a
little
bitterly
as
she
looked
back
again
i
saw
all
the
deceits
all
the
subterfuges
all
the
she
said
the
word
deliberately
meeting
his
eyes
again
he
thought
of
chilcote
but
his
face
paled
i
saw
it
all
i
lived
with
it
all
till
i
grew
hard
and
indifferent
till
i
acquiesced
in
your
as
readily
as
the
rest
of
the
world
that
had
suspected
and
did
again
she
laughed
nervously
and
i
thought
the
indifference
would
last
forever
if
one
lives
in
a
groove
for
years
one
gets
frozen
up
i
never
felt
more
frozen
than
on
the
night
fraide
spoke
to
me
of
you
asked
me
to
use
my
influence
then
on
that
night
yes
on
that
night
loder
voice
was
tense
but
her
excitement
had
suddenly
fallen
whether
his
glance
had
quelled
it
or
whether
the
force
of
her
feelings
had
worked
itself
out
it
was
impossible
to
say
but
her
eyes
had
lost
their
resolution
she
stood
hesitating
for
a
moment
then
she
turned
and
moved
to
the
that
night
you
found
me
changed
loder
was
insistent
changed
and
yet
not
she
spoke
reluctantly
with
averted
head
and
what
did
you
think
again
she
was
silent
then
again
a
faint
excitement
tinged
her
cheeks
i
thought
she
began
it
seemed
once
more
she
paused
hampered
by
her
own
uncertainty
her
own
sense
of
puzzling
incongruity
i
know
why
i
speak
like
this
she
went
on
at
last
as
if
in
justification
of
herself
or
why
i
want
to
speak
but
a
feeling
an
extraordinary
incomprehensible
feeling
seems
to
urge
me
on
the
same
feeling
that
came
to
me
on
the
day
we
had
tea
together
the
feeling
that
made
me
that
almost
made
me
believe
believe
what
the
words
escaped
him
without
volition
at
sound
of
his
voice
she
turned
believe
that
a
miracle
had
happened
she
said
that
you
had
found
strength
had
freed
from
morphia
from
in
the
silence
that
followed
loder
lived
through
a
century
of
suggestion
and
indecision
his
first
feeling
was
for
himself
but
his
first
clear
thought
was
for
chilcote
and
their
compact
he
stood
metaphorically
on
a
stone
in
the
middle
of
a
stream
balancing
on
one
foot
then
the
other
looking
to
the
right
bank
then
to
the
left
at
last
as
it
always
did
inspiration
came
to
him
slowly
he
realized
that
by
one
plunge
he
might
save
both
chilcote
and
himself
he
crossed
quickly
to
the
fireplace
and
stood
by
eve
you
were
right
in
your
belief
he
said
for
all
that
time
from
the
night
you
spoke
to
me
of
fraide
to
the
day
you
had
tea
in
this
room
i
never
touched
a
she
moved
suddenly
and
he
saw
her
face
john
she
said
unsteadily
you
i
i
have
known
you
to
lie
to
me
about
other
with
a
hasty
movement
he
averted
his
head
the
doubt
the
appeal
in
her
words
shocked
him
the
whole
isolation
of
her
life
seemed
summed
up
in
the
one
short
sentence
for
the
instant
he
forgot
chilcote
with
a
reaction
of
feeling
he
turned
to
her
again
look
at
me
he
said
brusquely
she
raised
her
eyes
do
you
believe
i
speaking
the
truth
she
searched
his
eyes
intently
the
doubt
and
hesitancy
still
struggling
in
her
face
but
the
last
three
weeks
she
said
reluctantly
how
can
you
ask
me
to
believe
he
had
expected
this
and
he
met
it
steadily
enough
nevertheless
his
courage
faltered
to
deceive
this
woman
even
to
justify
himself
had
in
the
last
halfhour
become
something
sacrilegious
the
last
three
weeks
must
be
buried
he
said
hurriedly
no
man
could
free
himself
suddenly
from
from
a
he
broke
off
abruptly
he
hated
chilcote
he
hated
himself
then
eve
face
raised
in
distressed
appeal
overshadowed
all
scruples
you
have
been
silent
and
patient
for
years
he
said
suddenly
can
you
be
patient
and
silent
a
little
longer
he
spoke
without
consideration
he
was
conscious
of
no
selfishness
beneath
his
words
in
the
first
exercise
of
conscious
strength
the
primitive
desire
to
reduce
all
elements
to
his
own
sovereignty
submerged
every
other
emotion
i
ca
enter
into
the
thing
he
said
like
you
i
give
no
explanations
i
can
only
tell
you
that
on
the
day
we
talked
together
in
this
room
i
was
myself
in
the
full
possession
of
my
reason
the
full
knowledge
of
my
own
capacities
the
man
you
have
known
in
the
last
three
weeks
the
man
you
have
imagined
in
the
last
four
years
is
a
shadow
an
unreality
a
weakness
in
human
form
there
is
a
new
chilcote
if
you
will
only
see
ewe
was
trembling
as
he
ceased
her
face
was
flushed
there
was
a
strange
brightness
in
her
eyes
she
was
moved
beyond
herself
but
the
other
you
the
old
you
you
must
be
he
looked
down
into
the
fire
times
like
the
last
three
weeks
will
come
again
must
come
again
they
are
inevitable
when
they
do
come
you
must
shut
your
eyes
you
must
blind
yourself
you
must
ignore
them
and
me
is
it
a
compact
he
still
avoided
her
eyes
she
turned
to
him
quietly
yes
if
you
wish
it
she
said
below
her
breath
he
was
conscious
of
her
glance
but
he
dared
not
meet
it
he
felt
sick
at
the
part
he
was
playing
yet
he
held
to
it
tenaciously
i
wonder
if
you
could
do
what
few
men
and
fewer
women
are
capable
of
he
asked
at
last
i
wonder
if
you
could
learn
to
live
in
the
present
he
lifted
his
head
slowly
and
met
her
eyes
this
is
an
an
experiment
he
went
on
and
like
all
experiments
it
has
good
phases
and
bad
when
the
bad
phases
come
round
i
i
want
you
to
tell
yourself
that
you
are
not
altogether
alone
in
your
unhappiness
that
i
am
suffering
too
in
another
there
was
silence
when
he
had
spoken
and
for
a
space
it
seemed
that
eve
would
make
no
response
then
the
last
surprise
in
a
day
of
surprises
came
to
him
with
a
slight
stir
a
slight
quick
rustle
of
skirts
she
stepped
forward
and
laid
her
hand
in
his
the
gesture
was
simple
and
very
sweet
her
eyes
were
soft
and
full
of
light
as
she
raised
her
face
to
his
her
lips
parted
in
unconscious
appeal
there
is
no
surrender
so
seductive
as
the
surrender
of
a
proud
woman
loder
blood
stirred
the
undeniable
suggestion
of
the
moment
thrilled
and
disconcerted
him
in
a
tumult
of
thought
honor
duty
principle
rose
in
a
triple
barrier
but
honor
duty
and
principle
are
but
words
to
a
headstrong
man
the
full
significance
of
his
position
came
to
him
as
it
had
never
come
before
his
hand
closed
on
hers
he
bent
towards
her
his
pulses
beating
unevenly
eve
he
said
then
at
sound
of
his
voice
he
suddenly
hesitated
it
was
the
voice
of
a
man
who
has
forgotten
everything
but
his
own
existence
for
an
instant
he
stayed
motionless
then
very
quietly
he
drew
away
from
her
releasing
her
hands
no
he
said
no
i
have
got
the
xviii
that
night
for
almost
the
first
time
since
he
had
adopted
his
dual
role
loder
slept
ill
he
was
not
a
man
over
whom
imagination
held
any
powerful
sway
his
doubts
and
misgivings
seldom
ran
to
speculation
upon
future
possibilities
nevertheless
the
fact
that
consciously
or
unconsciously
he
had
adopted
a
new
attitude
towards
eve
came
home
to
him
with
unpleasant
force
during
the
hours
of
darkness
and
long
before
the
first
hint
of
daylight
had
slipped
through
the
heavy
he
had
arranged
a
plan
of
action
a
plan
wherein
by
the
simple
method
of
altogether
avoiding
her
he
might
soothe
his
own
conscience
and
safeguard
chilcote
domestic
interests
it
was
a
satisfactory
if
a
somewhat
negative
arrangement
and
he
rose
next
morning
with
a
feeling
that
things
had
begun
to
shape
themselves
but
chance
sometimes
has
a
disconcerting
knack
of
forestalling
even
our
schemes
he
dressed
slowly
and
descended
to
his
solitary
breakfast
with
the
pleasant
sensation
of
having
put
last
night
out
of
consideration
by
the
turning
over
of
a
new
leaf
but
scarcely
had
he
opened
chilcote
letters
scarcely
had
he
taken
a
cursory
glance
at
the
morning
newspaper
than
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
that
not
only
a
new
leaf
but
a
whole
sheaf
of
new
leaves
had
been
turned
in
his
prospects
by
a
hand
infinitely
more
powerful
and
arbitrary
than
his
own
he
realized
within
the
space
of
a
few
moments
that
the
leisure
eve
might
have
claimed
the
leisure
he
might
have
been
tempted
to
devote
to
her
was
no
longer
his
to
dispose
of
being
already
demanded
of
him
from
a
quarter
that
allowed
of
no
refusal
for
the
first
rumbling
of
the
political
earthquake
that
was
to
shake
the
country
made
itself
audible
beyond
denial
on
that
morning
of
march
when
the
news
spread
through
england
that
in
view
of
the
disorganized
state
of
the
persian
army
and
the
shah
consequent
inability
to
suppress
the
open
insurrection
of
the
border
tribes
in
the
districts
of
meshed
russia
with
a
great
show
of
magnanimity
had
come
to
the
rescue
by
despatching
a
large
armed
force
from
her
military
station
at
merv
across
the
persian
frontier
to
the
seat
of
the
disturbance
to
many
hundreds
of
englishmen
who
read
their
papers
on
that
morning
this
announcement
conveyed
but
little
that
there
is
such
a
country
as
persia
we
all
know
that
english
interests
predominate
in
the
south
and
russian
interests
in
the
north
we
have
all
superficially
understood
from
childhood
but
in
this
knowledge
coupled
with
the
fact
that
persia
is
comfortably
far
away
we
are
apt
to
rest
content
it
is
only
to
the
eyes
that
see
through
glasses
the
minds
that
regard
the
present
as
nothing
more
nor
less
than
an
inevitable
link
joining
the
future
to
the
past
that
this
distant
debatable
land
stands
out
in
its
true
political
significance
to
the
average
reader
of
news
the
statement
of
russia
move
seemed
scarcely
more
important
than
had
the
first
report
of
the
border
risings
in
january
but
to
the
men
who
had
watched
the
growth
of
the
disturbance
it
came
charged
with
portentous
meaning
through
the
entire
ranks
of
the
opposition
from
fraide
himself
downward
it
caused
a
thrill
of
expectation
that
peculiar
prophetic
sensation
that
every
politician
has
experienced
at
some
moment
of
his
career
in
no
member
of
his
party
did
this
feeling
strike
deeper
root
than
in
loder
imbued
with
a
lifelong
interest
in
the
eastern
question
specially
equipped
by
personal
knowledge
to
hold
and
proclaim
an
opinion
upon
persian
affairs
he
read
the
signs
and
portents
with
instinctive
insight
seated
at
chilcote
table
surrounded
by
chilcote
letters
and
papers
he
forgot
the
breakfast
that
was
slowly
growing
cold
forgot
the
interests
and
dangers
personal
or
pleasurable
of
the
night
before
while
his
mental
eyes
persistently
conjured
up
the
map
of
persia
travelling
with
steady
deliberation
from
merv
to
meshed
from
meshed
to
herat
from
herat
to
the
empire
of
india
for
it
was
not
the
fact
that
the
hazaras
had
risen
against
the
shah
that
occupied
the
thinking
mind
nor
was
it
the
fact
that
russian
and
not
persian
troops
were
destined
to
subdue
them
but
the
deeply
important
consideration
that
an
armed
russian
force
had
crossed
the
frontier
and
was
encamped
within
twenty
miles
of
upon
which
covetous
russian
eyes
have
rested
ever
since
the
days
of
peter
the
great
so
loder
thoughts
ran
as
he
read
and
reread
the
news
from
the
varying
political
and
so
they
continued
to
run
when
some
hours
later
an
urgent
telephone
message
from
the
george
gazette
asked
him
to
call
at
lakely
office
the
message
was
interesting
as
well
as
imperative
and
he
made
an
instant
response
the
thought
of
lakely
keen
eyes
and
shrewd
enthusiasms
always
possessed
strong
attractions
for
his
own
slower
temperament
but
even
had
this
impetus
been
lacking
the
knowledge
that
at
the
george
offices
if
anywhere
the
true
feelings
of
the
party
were
invariably
voiced
would
have
drawn
him
without
hesitation
it
was
scarcely
twelve
when
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
tall
building
but
already
the
keen
spirit
that
lakely
everywhere
diffused
was
making
itself
felt
loder
smiled
to
himself
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
day
placards
with
their
uncompromising
headings
and
passed
onward
from
the
string
of
gayly
painted
carts
drawn
up
to
receive
their
first
consignment
of
the
paper
to
the
troop
of
eager
newsboys
passing
in
and
out
of
the
big
with
their
bundles
of
the
early
edition
and
with
a
renewed
thrill
of
anticipation
and
energy
he
passed
through
the
doorway
and
ran
passing
unchallenged
through
the
long
corridor
that
led
to
office
he
caught
a
fresh
impression
of
action
and
vitality
from
the
click
of
the
tape
machines
in
the
subeditors
office
and
a
glimpse
through
the
open
door
of
the
subeditors
themselves
each
occupied
with
his
particular
task
then
without
time
for
further
observation
he
found
himself
at
lakely
door
without
waiting
to
knock
as
he
had
felt
compelled
to
do
on
the
one
or
two
previous
occasions
that
business
had
brought
him
there
he
immediately
turned
the
handle
and
entered
the
room
editors
offices
differ
but
little
in
general
effect
lakely
surroundings
were
rather
more
elaborate
than
is
usual
as
became
the
dignity
of
the
oldest
tory
evening
paper
but
the
atmosphere
was
unmistakable
as
loder
entered
he
glanced
up
from
the
desk
at
which
he
was
sitting
but
instantly
returned
to
his
task
of
looking
through
and
marking
the
pile
of
early
evening
editions
that
were
spread
around
him
his
coat
was
off
and
hung
on
the
chair
behind
him
axed
he
pulled
vigorously
on
a
long
cigar
hullo
that
right
he
said
laconically
make
yourself
comfortable
half
a
second
while
i
skim
the
his
salutation
pleased
loder
with
a
nod
of
acquiescence
he
crossed
the
office
to
the
brisk
fire
that
burned
in
the
grate
for
a
minute
or
two
lakely
worked
steadily
occasionally
breaking
the
quiet
by
an
unintelligible
remark
or
a
vigorous
stroke
of
his
pencil
at
last
he
dropped
the
paper
with
a
gesture
of
satisfaction
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
well
he
said
what
think
of
this
how
this
for
a
complication
loder
turned
round
i
think
he
said
quietly
that
we
overestimate
lakely
laughed
and
took
a
long
pull
at
his
cigar
and
we
must
be
afraid
to
let
the
sefborough
crowd
know
it
eh
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
poster
of
the
first
edition
that
hung
before
his
desk
loder
following
his
glance
smiled
lakely
laughed
again
they
might
have
known
it
all
along
if
cared
to
deduce
he
said
did
they
really
believe
that
russia
was
going
to
sit
calmly
looking
across
the
while
the
shah
played
at
mobilizing
but
what
became
of
you
last
night
we
had
a
regular
prophesying
of
the
whole
business
at
bramfell
the
great
fraide
looked
in
for
five
minutes
i
went
on
with
him
to
the
club
afterwards
and
was
there
when
the
news
came
in
was
a
great
night
loder
face
lighted
up
i
can
imagine
it
he
said
with
an
unusual
touch
of
warmth
lakely
watched
him
intently
for
a
moment
then
with
a
quick
action
he
leaned
forward
and
rested
his
elbows
on
the
desk
it
going
to
be
something
more
than
imagination
for
you
chilcote
he
said
impressively
it
going
to
be
solid
earnest
he
spoke
rapidly
and
with
rather
more
than
his
usual
shrewd
decisiveness
then
he
paused
to
see
the
effect
of
his
announcement
loder
was
still
studying
the
flaring
poster
at
the
other
words
he
turned
sharply
something
in
lakely
voice
something
in
his
manner
arrested
him
a
tinge
of
color
crossed
his
face
reality
he
said
what
do
you
mean
for
a
further
space
his
companion
watched
him
then
with
a
rapid
movement
he
tilted
back
his
chair
yes
he
said
yes
old
fraide
instincts
are
never
far
out
quite
right
you
the
man
still
quietly
but
with
a
strange
underglow
of
excitement
loder
left
the
fire
and
coming
forward
took
a
chair
at
lakely
desk
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
driving
at
he
asked
in
his
old
laconic
voice
lakely
still
scrutinized
him
with
an
air
of
brisk
satisfaction
then
with
a
gesture
of
finality
he
tossed
his
cigar
away
my
dear
chap
he
said
there
going
to
be
a
breach
somewhere
and
fraide
says
you
the
man
to
step
in
and
fill
it
you
see
five
years
ago
when
things
looked
lively
on
the
gulf
and
the
bundar
abbas
business
came
to
light
you
did
some
promising
work
and
a
reputation
like
that
sticks
to
a
man
even
when
he
turns
slacker
i
wo
deny
that
slacked
abominably
he
added
as
loder
made
an
uneasy
movement
but
slacking
has
different
effects
some
men
run
to
seed
others
mature
i
had
almost
put
you
down
on
the
black
list
but
i
altered
my
mind
in
the
last
two
again
loder
stirred
in
his
seat
a
host
of
emotions
were
stirring
in
his
mind
every
word
wrung
from
lakely
was
another
stimulus
to
pride
another
subtle
tribute
to
the
curious
force
of
personality
well
he
said
well
lakely
smiled
we
all
know
that
sefborough
ministry
is
well
he
said
sefborough
is
building
his
card
house
just
a
story
too
high
it
a
what
upset
the
balance
it
might
be
the
army
of
course
or
it
might
be
education
but
it
might
quite
as
well
be
a
matter
of
foreign
policy
they
looked
at
each
other
in
comprehensive
silence
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
it
not
the
question
of
whether
russia
comes
into
persia
but
the
question
of
whether
russia
goes
out
of
persia
when
these
hazaras
are
subdued
i
lay
you
what
you
like
chilcote
that
within
one
week
we
hear
that
the
risings
are
suppressed
but
that
russia
instead
of
retiring
has
advanced
those
tempting
twenty
miles
and
comfortably
ensconced
herself
at
meshed
as
she
ensconced
herself
on
the
island
of
ashurada
lakely
nervous
energetic
figure
was
braced
his
eyes
brightened
by
the
intensity
of
his
interest
if
this
news
comes
before
the
easter
recess
he
went
on
the
first
nail
can
be
hammered
in
on
the
motion
for
adjournment
and
if
the
right
man
does
it
in
the
right
way
i
lay
my
life
be
a
nail
in
sefborough
loder
sat
very
still
overwhelming
possibilities
had
suddenly
opened
before
him
in
a
moment
the
unreality
of
the
past
months
had
become
real
a
tangible
justification
of
himself
and
his
imposture
was
suddenly
made
possible
in
the
stress
of
understanding
he
too
leaned
forward
and
resting
his
elbows
on
the
desk
took
his
face
between
his
hands
for
a
space
lakely
made
no
remark
to
him
man
and
man
moods
came
second
in
interest
to
his
paper
and
his
party
politics
that
chilcote
should
be
conscious
of
the
glories
he
had
opened
up
seemed
only
natural
that
he
should
show
that
consciousness
in
a
becoming
gravity
seemed
only
right
for
some
seconds
he
made
no
attempt
to
disturb
him
but
at
last
his
own
irrepressible
activity
made
silence
unendurable
he
caught
up
his
pencil
and
tapped
impatiently
on
the
desk
chilcote
he
said
quickly
and
with
a
gleam
of
sudden
anxiety
not
by
any
chance
doubtful
of
yourself
at
sound
of
his
voice
loder
lifted
his
face
it
was
quite
pale
again
but
the
energy
and
resolution
that
had
come
into
it
when
lakely
first
spoke
were
still
to
be
seen
no
lakely
he
said
very
slowly
it
not
the
sort
of
moment
in
which
a
man
doubts
xix
and
so
it
came
about
that
loder
was
freed
from
one
responsibility
to
undertake
another
from
the
morning
of
march
when
lakely
had
expounded
the
political
programme
in
the
offices
of
the
gazette
to
the
afternoon
of
april
he
found
himself
a
central
figure
in
the
whirlpool
of
activity
that
formed
itself
in
conservative
circles
with
the
acumen
for
which
he
was
noted
lakely
had
touched
the
of
the
situation
on
that
morning
and
succeeding
events
each
fraught
with
its
own
importance
had
established
the
precision
of
his
forecast
minutely
watchful
of
russia
attitude
fraide
quietly
organized
his
forces
and
strengthened
his
position
with
a
statesmanlike
grasp
of
opportunity
and
to
loder
the
attributes
displayed
by
his
leader
during
those
trying
days
formed
an
endless
and
absorbing
study
setting
the
thought
of
chilcote
aside
ignoring
his
own
position
and
the
risks
he
daily
ran
he
had
fully
yielded
to
the
glamour
of
the
moment
and
in
the
first
freedom
of
a
loose
rein
he
had
given
unreservedly
all
that
he
possessed
of
activity
capacity
and
determination
to
the
cause
that
had
claimed
him
singularly
privileged
in
a
constant
personal
contact
with
fraide
he
learned
many
valuable
lessons
of
tact
and
organization
in
those
five
vital
days
during
which
the
tactics
of
a
whole
party
hung
upon
one
item
of
news
from
a
country
thousands
of
miles
away
for
should
russia
subdue
the
insurgent
hazaras
and
laden
with
the
honors
of
the
peacemaker
retire
across
the
frontier
then
the
political
arena
would
remain
undisturbed
but
should
the
movement
predicted
by
lakely
become
an
accepted
fact
before
parliament
rose
for
the
easter
recess
then
the
first
blow
in
the
fight
that
would
rage
during
the
succeeding
session
must
inevitably
be
struck
in
the
mean
time
it
was
difficult
position
to
wait
and
watch
and
yet
preserve
his
dignity
it
was
early
in
the
afternoon
of
march
that
loder
in
response
to
a
invitation
lunched
quietly
with
the
fraides
being
delayed
by
some
communications
from
wark
he
was
a
few
minutes
late
in
keeping
his
appointment
and
on
being
shown
into
the
found
the
little
group
of
three
that
was
to
make
up
the
party
already
assembled
fraide
lady
sarah
and
eve
as
he
entered
the
room
they
ceased
to
speak
and
all
three
turned
in
his
direction
in
the
first
moment
he
had
a
vague
impression
of
responding
suitably
to
lady
sarah
cordial
greeting
but
he
knew
that
immediately
and
unconsciously
his
eyes
turned
to
eve
while
a
quick
sense
of
surprise
and
satisfaction
passed
through
him
at
sight
of
her
for
an
instant
he
wondered
how
she
would
mark
his
avoidance
of
her
since
their
last
eventful
interview
then
instantly
he
blamed
himself
for
the
passing
doubt
for
before
all
things
he
knew
her
to
be
a
woman
of
the
world
he
took
fraide
outstretched
hand
and
again
he
looked
towards
eve
waiting
for
her
to
speak
she
met
his
glance
but
said
nothing
instead
of
speaking
she
smiled
at
him
a
smile
that
was
far
more
reassuring
than
any
words
a
smile
that
in
a
single
second
conveyed
forgiveness
approbation
and
a
warm
almost
tender
sense
of
sympathy
and
comprehension
the
remembrance
of
that
smile
stayed
with
him
long
after
they
were
seated
at
table
and
far
into
the
future
the
remembrance
of
the
lunch
itself
with
its
pleasant
private
sense
of
satisfaction
was
destined
to
return
to
him
in
retrospective
moments
the
delightful
atmosphere
of
the
fraides
home
life
had
always
been
a
wonder
and
an
enigma
to
him
but
on
this
day
he
seemed
to
grasp
its
meaning
by
a
new
light
as
he
watched
eve
soften
under
its
influence
and
felt
himself
drawn
imperceptibly
from
the
position
of
a
speculative
outsider
to
that
of
an
intimate
it
was
a
fresh
side
to
the
complex
fascinating
life
of
which
fraide
was
the
master
spirit
these
reflections
had
grown
agreeably
familiar
to
his
mind
the
talk
momentarily
diverted
into
social
channels
was
quietly
drifting
back
to
the
inevitable
question
of
the
situation
that
in
private
moments
was
never
far
from
their
lips
when
the
event
that
was
to
mark
and
separate
that
day
from
those
that
had
preceded
it
was
unceremoniously
thrust
upon
them
without
announcement
or
apology
the
door
was
suddenly
flung
open
and
lakely
entered
the
room
his
face
was
brimming
with
excitement
and
his
eyes
flashed
in
the
first
haste
of
the
entry
he
failed
to
see
that
there
were
ladies
in
the
room
and
crossing
instantly
to
fraide
laid
an
open
telegram
before
him
this
is
official
sir
he
said
then
at
last
he
glanced
round
the
table
lady
sarah
he
exclaimed
can
you
forgive
me
but
i
have
given
a
hundred
pounds
to
be
the
first
with
this
he
glanced
back
at
fraide
lady
sarah
rose
and
stretched
out
her
hand
mr
lakely
she
said
i
more
than
understand
there
was
a
thrill
in
her
warm
cordial
voice
and
her
eyes
also
turned
towards
her
husband
of
the
whole
party
fraide
alone
was
perfectly
calm
he
sat
very
still
his
small
thin
figure
erect
and
dignified
as
his
eyes
scanned
the
message
that
meant
so
much
eve
who
had
sprung
from
her
seat
and
passed
round
the
table
at
sound
of
lakely
news
was
leaning
over
his
shoulder
reading
the
telegram
with
him
at
the
last
word
she
lifted
her
head
her
face
flushed
with
excitement
how
splendid
it
must
be
to
be
a
man
she
exclaimed
and
without
premeditation
her
eyes
and
loder
met
in
this
manner
came
the
news
from
persia
and
with
it
loder
definite
call
in
the
momentary
stress
of
action
it
was
impossible
that
any
thought
of
chilcote
could
obtrude
itself
events
had
followed
each
other
too
rapidly
decisive
action
had
been
too
much
thrust
upon
him
to
allow
of
hesitation
and
it
was
in
this
spirit
under
this
vigorous
pressure
that
he
made
his
attack
upon
the
government
on
the
day
that
followed
fraide
luncheon
party
that
indefinable
attentiveness
that
alert
sensation
of
impending
storm
that
is
so
strong
an
index
of
the
parliamentary
atmosphere
was
very
keen
on
that
memorable
first
of
april
it
was
obvious
in
the
crowded
benches
on
both
sides
of
the
house
in
the
oneness
of
purpose
that
insensibly
made
itself
felt
through
the
ranks
of
the
opposition
and
found
definite
expression
in
fraide
stiff
figure
and
tightly
shut
lips
in
the
unmistakable
uneasiness
that
lay
upon
the
ministerial
benches
but
notwithstanding
these
indications
of
battle
the
early
portion
of
the
proceedings
was
unmarked
by
excitement
being
tinged
with
the
purposeless
lack
of
vitality
that
had
of
late
marked
all
affairs
of
the
sefborough
ministry
and
it
was
not
until
the
adjournment
of
the
house
for
the
easter
recess
had
at
last
been
moved
that
the
spirit
of
activity
hovering
in
the
air
descended
and
galvanized
the
assembly
into
life
it
was
then
amid
a
stir
of
interest
that
loder
slowly
rose
many
curious
incidents
have
marked
the
annals
of
the
house
of
commons
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
it
has
ever
been
the
lot
of
a
member
to
hear
his
own
voice
raised
for
the
first
time
on
a
subject
of
vital
interest
to
his
party
having
been
denied
all
initial
assistance
of
minor
questions
asked
or
unimportant
amendments
made
of
all
those
gathered
together
in
the
great
building
on
that
day
only
one
man
appreciated
the
difficulty
of
loder
position
and
that
man
was
loder
himself
he
rose
slowly
and
stood
silent
for
a
couple
of
seconds
his
body
braced
his
fingers
touching
the
sheaf
of
notes
that
lay
in
front
of
him
to
the
waiting
house
the
silence
was
effective
it
might
mean
or
it
might
mean
a
failure
of
nerve
at
a
critical
moment
either
possibility
had
a
tinge
of
piquancy
moved
by
the
same
impulse
fifty
pairs
o
eyes
turned
upon
him
with
new
interest
but
up
in
the
ladies
gallery
eve
clasped
her
hands
in
sudden
apprehension
and
fraide
sitting
stiffly
in
his
seat
turned
and
shot
one
swift
glance
at
the
man
on
whom
against
prudence
and
precedent
he
had
pinned
his
faith
the
glance
was
swift
but
very
searching
and
with
a
characteristic
movement
of
his
wiry
shoulders
he
resumed
his
position
and
his
usual
grave
attentive
attitude
at
the
same
moment
loder
lifted
his
head
and
began
to
speak
here
at
the
outset
his
inexperience
met
him
his
voice
pitched
too
low
only
reached
those
directly
near
him
it
was
a
moment
of
great
strain
eve
listening
intently
drew
a
long
breath
of
suspense
and
let
her
fingers
drop
apart
the
sceptical
watchful
eyes
that
faced
him
line
upon
line
seemed
to
flash
and
brighten
with
critical
interest
only
fraide
made
no
change
of
expression
he
sat
placid
serious
attentive
with
the
shadow
of
a
smile
behind
his
eyes
again
loder
paused
but
this
time
the
pause
was
shorter
the
ordeal
he
had
dreaded
and
waited
for
was
passed
and
he
saw
his
way
clearly
with
the
old
movement
of
the
shoulders
he
straightened
himself
and
once
more
began
to
speak
this
time
his
voice
rang
quietly
true
and
commanding
across
the
floor
of
the
house
no
first
step
can
be
really
great
it
must
of
necessity
possess
more
of
prophecy
than
of
achievement
nevertheless
it
is
by
the
first
step
that
a
man
marks
the
value
not
only
of
his
cause
but
of
himself
following
broadly
on
the
lines
that
tradition
has
laid
down
for
the
conservative
orator
loder
disguised
rather
than
displayed
the
vein
of
strong
persuasive
eloquence
that
was
his
natural
gift
the
occasion
that
might
possibly
justify
such
a
display
of
individuality
might
lie
with
the
future
but
it
had
no
application
to
the
present
for
the
moment
his
duty
was
to
voice
his
party
sentiments
with
as
much
lucidity
as
much
logic
and
as
much
calm
conviction
as
lay
within
his
capacity
standing
quietly
in
chilcote
place
he
was
conscious
with
a
deep
sense
of
gravity
of
the
peculiarity
of
his
position
and
perhaps
it
was
this
unconscious
and
unstudied
seriousness
that
lent
him
the
tone
of
weight
and
judgment
so
essential
to
the
cause
he
had
in
hand
it
has
always
been
difficult
to
arouse
the
interest
of
the
house
on
matters
of
british
policy
in
persia
once
aroused
it
may
it
is
true
reach
fever
heat
with
remarkable
rapidity
but
the
introductory
stages
offer
that
worst
danger
to
the
earnest
speaker
the
dread
of
an
apathetic
audience
but
from
this
consideration
loder
by
his
sharp
consciousness
of
personal
difficulties
was
given
immunity
pitching
his
voice
in
that
quietly
masterful
tone
that
beyond
all
others
compels
attention
he
took
up
his
subject
and
dealt
with
it
with
dispassionate
force
with
great
skill
he
touched
on
the
steady
southward
advance
of
russia
into
persian
territory
from
the
distant
days
when
by
a
curious
irony
of
fate
russian
and
british
enterprise
combined
to
make
entry
into
the
country
under
the
sanction
of
the
of
moscovy
to
the
present
hour
when
this
great
power
of
russia
long
since
alienated
by
interests
and
desires
from
her
former
had
taken
a
step
which
in
the
eyes
of
every
thinking
man
must
possess
a
deep
significance
with
quiet
persistence
he
pointed
out
the
peculiar
position
of
meshed
in
the
distant
province
of
khorasan
its
vast
distance
from
the
persian
gulf
round
which
british
interests
and
influence
centre
and
the
consequently
alarming
position
of
hundreds
of
traders
who
in
the
security
of
british
sovereignty
are
fighting
their
way
upward
from
india
from
afghanistan
even
from
england
herself
following
up
his
point
he
dilated
on
these
subjects
of
the
british
crown
who
cut
off
from
adequate
assistance
can
only
turn
in
personal
or
commercial
peril
to
the
protective
power
of
the
nearest
consulate
then
quietly
demanding
the
attention
of
his
hearers
he
marshalled
fact
after
fact
to
demonstrate
the
isolation
and
inadequacy
of
a
consulate
so
situated
the
all
but
arbitrary
power
of
russia
who
in
her
new
occupation
of
meshed
had
only
two
considerations
to
withhold
her
from
open
aggression
the
knowledge
of
england
as
a
very
considerable
but
also
a
very
distant
power
the
knowledge
of
persia
as
an
imminent
but
wholly
impotent
factor
in
the
case
having
stated
his
opinions
he
reverted
to
the
motive
of
his
speech
his
desire
to
put
forward
a
strong
protest
against
the
adjournment
of
the
house
without
an
assurance
from
the
government
that
immediate
measures
would
be
taken
to
safeguard
british
interests
in
meshed
and
throughout
the
province
of
khorasan
the
immediate
outcome
of
loder
speech
was
all
that
his
party
had
desired
the
effect
on
the
house
had
been
marked
and
when
no
satisfactory
response
coming
to
his
demand
he
had
in
still
more
resolute
and
insistent
terms
called
for
a
division
on
the
motion
for
adjournment
the
result
had
been
an
appreciable
fall
in
the
government
majority
to
loder
himself
the
realization
that
he
had
at
last
vindicated
and
justified
himself
by
individual
action
had
a
peculiar
effect
his
position
had
been
altered
in
one
remarkable
particular
before
this
day
he
alone
had
known
himself
to
be
strong
now
the
knowledge
was
shared
by
others
and
he
was
human
enough
to
be
susceptible
to
the
change
the
first
appreciation
of
it
came
immediately
after
the
excitement
of
the
division
when
fraide
singling
him
out
took
his
arm
and
pressed
it
affectionately
my
dear
chilcote
he
said
we
are
all
proud
of
you
then
looking
up
into
his
face
he
added
in
a
graver
tone
but
keep
your
mind
upon
the
future
never
be
blinded
by
the
present
however
bright
it
at
the
touch
of
his
hand
at
the
spontaneous
approval
of
his
first
words
loder
pride
thrilled
and
in
a
vehement
rush
of
ambition
his
senses
answered
to
the
praise
then
as
fraide
in
all
unconsciousness
added
his
second
sentence
the
hot
glow
of
feeling
suddenly
chilled
in
a
sweep
of
intuitive
reaction
the
meaning
and
the
danger
of
his
falsely
real
position
extinguished
his
excitement
and
turned
his
triumph
cold
with
an
involuntary
gesture
he
withdrew
his
arm
you
very
good
sir
he
said
and
you
very
right
we
never
should
forget
that
there
is
a
the
old
man
glanced
up
surprised
by
the
tone
quite
so
chilcote
he
said
kindly
but
we
only
advise
those
in
whom
we
believe
to
look
towards
it
shall
we
find
my
wife
i
know
she
will
want
to
bear
you
home
with
but
loder
joy
in
himself
and
his
achievement
had
dropped
from
him
he
shrank
suddenly
from
lady
sarah
congratulations
and
eve
warm
silent
approbation
thanks
sir
he
said
but
i
do
feel
fit
for
society
a
touch
of
my
nerves
i
he
laughed
shortly
but
do
you
mind
saying
to
eve
that
i
hope
i
have
satisfied
her
he
added
this
as
if
in
then
with
a
short
pressure
of
hand
he
turned
evading
the
many
groups
that
waited
to
claim
him
and
passed
out
of
the
house
alone
hailing
a
cab
he
drove
to
grosvenor
square
all
the
exaltation
of
an
hour
ago
had
turned
to
ashes
his
excitement
had
found
its
culmination
in
a
sense
of
futility
and
premonition
he
met
no
one
in
the
hall
or
on
the
stairs
of
chilcote
house
and
on
entering
the
study
he
found
that
also
deserted
greening
had
been
among
the
most
absorbed
of
those
who
had
listened
to
his
speech
passing
at
once
into
the
room
he
crossed
as
if
by
instinct
to
the
desk
and
there
halted
on
the
top
of
some
unopened
letters
lay
the
significant
yellow
envelope
of
a
telegram
the
telegram
that
in
an
unformed
subconscious
way
had
sprung
to
his
expectation
on
the
moment
of
congratulation
very
quietly
he
picked
it
up
opened
and
read
it
and
with
the
automatic
caution
that
had
become
habitual
carried
it
across
the
room
and
dropped
it
in
the
fire
this
done
he
returned
to
the
desk
read
the
letters
that
awaited
chilcote
and
scribbling
the
necessary
notes
upon
the
margins
left
them
in
readiness
for
greening
then
moving
with
the
same
quiet
suppression
he
passed
from
the
room
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
street
by
the
way
he
had
come
xx
on
the
fifth
day
after
the
momentous
of
april
on
which
he
had
recalled
loder
and
resumed
his
own
life
chilcote
left
his
house
and
walked
towards
bond
street
though
the
morning
was
clear
and
the
air
almost
warm
for
the
time
of
year
he
was
buttoned
into
a
long
overcoat
and
was
wearing
a
muffler
and
a
pair
of
doeskin
gloves
as
he
passed
along
the
street
he
kept
close
to
the
house
fronts
to
avoid
the
sun
that
was
everywhere
stirring
the
winterbound
town
like
a
suffusion
of
young
blood
through
old
veins
he
avoided
the
warmth
because
in
this
instance
warmth
meant
light
but
as
he
moved
he
shivered
slightly
from
time
to
time
with
the
haunting
permeating
cold
that
of
late
had
become
his
persistent
shadow
he
was
ill
at
case
as
he
hurried
forward
with
each
succeeding
day
of
the
old
life
the
new
annoyances
the
new
obligations
became
more
hampering
before
his
compact
with
loder
this
old
life
had
been
a
net
about
his
feet
now
the
meshes
seemed
to
have
narrowed
the
net
itself
to
have
spread
till
it
smothered
his
whole
being
his
own
household
his
own
rooms
even
offered
no
sanctuary
the
presence
of
another
personality
tinged
the
atmosphere
it
was
preposterous
but
it
was
undeniable
the
lay
figure
that
he
had
set
in
his
place
had
proved
to
be
flesh
and
blood
had
usurped
his
life
his
position
his
very
personality
by
sheer
right
of
strength
as
he
walked
along
bond
street
in
the
first
sunshine
of
the
year
jostled
by
the
crowd
he
felt
a
pariah
he
revolted
at
the
new
order
of
things
but
the
revolt
was
a
silent
iron
of
expediency
had
entered
into
his
soul
he
dared
not
jeopardize
loder
position
because
he
dared
not
dispense
with
loder
the
door
that
guarded
his
vice
drew
him
more
resistlessly
with
every
indulgence
and
loder
was
the
voice
that
called
the
open
sesame
he
walked
on
aimlessly
he
had
been
but
five
days
at
home
and
already
the
quiet
court
of
clifford
inn
the
bare
staircase
the
comfortless
privacy
of
loder
rooms
seemed
a
haven
of
refuge
the
speed
with
which
this
hunger
had
returned
frightened
him
he
walked
forward
rapidly
and
without
encountering
a
check
then
suddenly
the
spell
was
broken
from
the
slowly
moving
brilliantly
dressed
throng
of
people
some
one
called
him
by
his
name
and
turning
he
saw
lillian
astrupp
she
was
stepping
from
the
door
of
a
jeweller
and
as
he
turned
she
paused
holding
out
her
hand
the
very
person
i
would
have
wished
to
see
she
exclaimed
where
have
you
been
these
hundred
years
i
heard
of
nobody
but
you
since
turned
politician
and
ceased
to
be
a
mere
member
of
parliament
she
laughed
softly
the
laugh
suited
the
light
spring
air
as
she
herself
suited
the
pleasant
superficial
scene
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
while
his
eyes
travelled
from
her
delicate
face
to
her
pale
cloth
gown
from
her
soft
furs
to
the
bunch
of
roses
fastened
in
her
muff
the
sight
of
her
was
a
curious
relief
her
cool
slim
fingers
were
so
casual
yet
so
clinging
her
voice
and
her
presence
were
so
redolent
of
easy
artificial
things
how
well
you
look
he
said
involuntarily
again
she
laughed
that
my
prerogative
she
responded
lightly
but
i
was
serious
in
being
glad
to
see
you
sarcastic
people
are
always
so
intuitive
i
looking
for
some
one
with
chilcote
glanced
up
extravagant
again
he
said
dryly
she
smiled
at
him
sweetly
jack
she
murmured
with
slow
reproach
chilcote
laughed
quickly
i
understand
you
changed
your
minister
of
finance
i
wanted
in
some
other
this
time
her
reproach
was
expressed
by
a
glance
you
are
always
wanted
she
said
the
words
seemed
to
rouse
him
again
to
the
shadowy
that
the
sight
of
her
had
lifted
it
it
delightful
to
meet
you
like
this
he
began
and
i
wish
the
meeting
was
momentary
but
i
i
rather
pressed
for
time
you
must
let
me
come
round
one
afternoon
or
evening
when
you
he
fumbled
for
a
moment
with
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
glanced
furtively
upward
towards
oxford
street
but
again
lillian
smiled
this
time
to
herself
if
she
understood
anything
on
earth
it
was
chilcote
and
his
moods
if
one
may
be
careless
of
anything
jack
she
said
lightly
surely
it
of
time
i
can
imagine
being
pressed
for
anything
else
in
the
world
if
it
an
appointment
you
worrying
about
a
motor
goes
ever
so
much
faster
than
a
cab
she
looked
at
him
tentatively
her
head
slightly
on
one
side
her
muff
raised
till
the
roses
and
some
of
the
soft
fur
touched
her
cheek
she
looked
very
charming
and
very
persuasive
as
chilcote
glanced
back
again
she
seemed
to
represent
a
respite
something
graceful
and
subtle
in
a
world
of
oppressive
obligations
his
eyes
strayed
from
her
figure
to
the
smart
drawn
up
beside
the
curb
she
saw
the
glance
ever
so
much
quicker
she
insinuated
and
smiling
again
she
stepped
forward
from
the
door
of
the
shop
after
a
indecision
chilcote
followed
her
the
waiting
car
had
three
seats
one
in
front
for
the
chauffeur
two
at
the
back
offering
pleasant
possibilities
of
a
the
park
and
drive
slowly
lillian
ordered
as
she
stepped
inside
motioning
chilcote
to
the
seat
opposite
they
moved
up
bond
street
smoothly
and
rapidly
lillian
was
absorbed
in
the
passing
traffic
until
the
marble
arch
was
reached
then
as
they
glided
through
the
big
gates
she
looked
across
at
her
companion
he
had
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
coat
though
the
wind
was
scarcely
perceptible
and
buried
himself
in
it
to
the
ears
it
is
extraordinary
she
exclaimed
suddenly
as
her
eyes
rested
on
his
face
it
was
seldom
that
she
felt
drawn
to
exclamation
she
was
usually
too
indolent
to
show
surprise
but
now
the
feeling
was
called
forth
before
she
was
aware
chilcote
looked
up
what
extraordinary
he
said
sensitively
she
leaned
forward
for
an
instant
and
touched
his
hand
bear
she
said
teasingly
did
i
rub
your
fur
the
wrong
way
then
seeing
his
expression
she
tactfully
changed
her
tone
i
explain
it
was
the
same
thing
that
struck
me
the
night
of
blanche
party
when
you
looked
at
me
over
leonard
kaine
head
you
remember
she
glanced
away
from
him
across
the
park
to
where
the
grass
was
already
showing
greener
chilcote
felt
ill
at
ease
again
he
put
his
hand
to
his
coat
collar
oh
yes
he
said
hastily
he
wished
now
that
he
had
questioned
loder
more
closely
on
the
proceedings
of
that
party
it
seemed
to
him
on
looking
back
that
loder
had
mentioned
nothing
on
the
day
of
their
last
exchange
but
the
political
complications
that
absorbed
his
mind
i
could
explain
then
lillian
went
on
i
could
explain
before
a
crowd
of
people
that
it
was
your
dark
head
showing
over
leonard
red
one
that
surprised
me
but
the
most
wonderful
the
most
extraordinary
likeness
she
paused
the
car
was
moving
slower
there
was
a
delight
in
the
easy
motion
through
the
fresh
early
air
but
chilcote
uneasiness
had
been
aroused
he
no
longer
felt
soothed
what
likeness
he
asked
sharply
she
turned
to
him
easily
oh
a
likeness
i
have
noticed
before
she
said
a
likeness
that
always
seemed
strange
but
that
suddenly
became
incredible
at
blanche
he
moved
quickly
likenesses
are
an
illusion
he
said
a
mere
imagination
of
the
brain
his
manner
was
short
his
annoyance
seemingly
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
cause
lillian
looked
at
him
afresh
in
slightly
interested
surprise
yet
not
so
very
long
ago
you
yourself
she
began
nonsense
he
broke
in
i
always
denied
likenesses
such
things
do
really
exist
is
purely
an
individual
matter
a
he
spoke
fast
he
was
uneasy
under
the
cool
scrutiny
of
her
green
eyes
and
with
a
sharp
attempt
at
and
reassurance
he
altered
his
voice
after
all
we
being
very
stupid
he
exclaimed
we
worrying
over
something
that
does
lillian
was
still
lazily
interested
to
her
own
belief
she
had
seen
chilcote
last
on
the
night
of
her
sister
reception
then
she
had
been
too
preoccupied
to
notice
either
his
manner
or
his
health
though
superficially
it
had
lingered
in
her
mind
that
he
had
seemed
unusually
reliant
unusually
well
on
that
night
a
remembrance
of
the
impression
came
to
her
now
as
she
studied
his
face
upon
which
imperceptibly
and
yet
relentlessly
his
vice
was
setting
its
mark
in
the
dull
restlessness
of
eye
the
unhealthy
sallowness
of
skin
some
shred
of
her
thought
some
suggestion
of
the
comparison
running
through
her
mind
must
have
shown
in
her
face
for
chilcote
altered
his
position
with
a
touch
of
uneasiness
he
glanced
away
across
the
long
sweep
of
drive
stretching
between
the
trees
then
he
glanced
furtively
back
he
said
quickly
you
wanted
me
for
something
the
memory
of
her
earlier
suggestion
came
as
a
sudden
boon
she
lifted
her
muff
again
and
smelled
her
roses
thoughtfully
oh
it
was
nothing
really
she
said
you
sarcastic
people
give
very
shrewd
suggestions
sometimes
and
i
been
rather
wanting
a
suggestion
on
an
an
adventure
that
i
she
looked
down
at
her
flowers
with
a
charmingly
attentive
air
but
chilcote
restlessness
had
increased
looking
up
she
suddenly
caught
the
expression
and
her
own
face
changed
my
dear
jack
she
said
softly
what
a
bore
i
am
let
forget
tedious
things
and
enjoy
she
leaned
towards
him
caressingly
with
an
air
of
concern
and
reproach
the
action
was
not
without
effect
her
soothing
voice
her
smile
her
almost
affectionate
gesture
each
carried
weight
with
a
swift
return
of
assurance
he
responded
to
her
tone
right
he
said
right
we
will
enjoy
ourselves
he
laughed
quickly
and
again
with
a
conscious
movement
lifted
his
hand
to
his
muffler
then
we
postpone
the
advice
lillian
laughed
too
yes
right
we
postpone
the
word
pleased
him
and
he
caught
at
it
we
wo
bother
about
it
now
but
we
wo
shelve
it
altogether
we
postpone
she
settled
herself
more
comfortably
you
dine
with
me
one
night
and
we
can
talk
it
out
then
i
see
so
little
of
you
nowadays
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
my
dear
girl
you
unfair
chilcote
spirits
had
risen
he
spoke
rapidly
almost
pleasantly
it
is
i
who
keep
away
it
the
stupid
affairs
of
the
world
that
keep
me
i
be
with
you
every
hour
of
the
twelve
if
i
had
my
she
looked
up
at
the
bare
trees
her
expression
was
a
delightful
mixture
of
amusement
satisfaction
and
scepticism
then
you
will
dine
she
said
at
last
his
reaction
to
high
spirits
carried
him
forward
how
nice
shall
we
fix
a
day
a
day
yes
yes
if
you
he
hesitated
for
an
instant
then
again
the
impulse
of
the
previous
moment
dominated
his
other
feeling
yes
he
said
quickly
yes
after
all
why
not
fix
it
now
with
a
sudden
inclination
towards
amiability
he
opened
his
overcoat
thrust
his
hand
into
an
inner
pocket
and
drew
out
his
the
same
long
narrow
book
fitted
with
two
pencils
that
loder
had
scanned
so
interestedly
on
his
first
morning
at
grosvenor
square
he
opened
it
turning
the
pages
rapidly
what
day
shall
it
be
thursday
full
and
friday
and
saturday
what
a
bore
he
still
talked
fast
lillian
leaned
across
what
a
sweet
book
she
said
but
why
the
blue
crosses
she
touched
one
of
the
pages
with
her
gloved
finger
chilcote
jerked
the
book
then
laughed
with
a
touch
of
embarrassment
oh
the
crosses
merely
to
remind
me
that
certain
must
be
kept
you
know
my
beastly
memory
but
what
about
the
day
shall
we
fix
the
day
his
voice
was
in
control
but
mentally
her
trivial
question
had
disturbed
and
jarred
him
what
day
shall
we
say
he
repeated
monday
in
next
week
lillian
glanced
up
with
a
faint
exclamation
of
disappointment
how
horribly
faraway
she
spoke
with
engaging
petulance
and
leaning
forward
afresh
drew
the
book
from
chilcote
hand
what
about
she
exclaimed
turning
back
a
page
why
not
i
knew
i
saw
a
blank
oh
i
i
he
stopped
jack
her
voice
dropped
it
was
true
that
she
desired
opinion
on
her
adventure
for
chilcote
opinion
on
men
and
manners
had
a
certain
bitter
shrewdness
but
the
exercise
of
her
own
power
added
a
point
to
the
desire
if
the
matter
had
ended
with
the
gain
or
loss
of
a
with
him
it
is
probable
that
whatever
its
utility
she
would
not
have
pressed
it
but
the
underlying
motive
was
the
stronger
chilcote
had
been
a
satellite
for
years
and
it
was
unpleasant
that
any
satellite
should
drop
away
into
space
jack
she
said
again
in
a
lower
and
still
more
effective
tone
and
lifting
her
muff
she
buried
her
face
in
her
flowers
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
dine
and
go
to
a
with
leonard
or
stay
at
home
by
myself
she
murmured
looking
out
across
the
trees
again
chilcote
glanced
over
the
long
ride
they
had
made
the
full
circuit
of
the
park
it
tiresome
being
by
one
self
she
murmured
for
a
while
he
was
irresponsive
then
slowly
his
eyes
returned
to
her
face
he
watched
her
for
a
second
and
leaning
quickly
towards
her
he
took
his
book
and
scribbled
something
in
the
vacant
space
she
watched
him
interestedly
her
face
lighted
up
and
she
laid
aside
her
muff
dear
jack
she
said
how
very
sweet
of
you
then
as
he
held
the
book
towards
her
her
face
fell
dine
cadogan
gardens
talk
with
she
read
why
you
forgotten
the
essential
thing
he
looked
up
the
essential
thing
she
smiled
the
blue
cross
she
said
is
it
worth
even
a
little
one
the
tone
was
very
soft
chilcote
yielded
you
have
the
blue
pencil
he
said
in
sudden
response
to
her
mood
she
glanced
up
in
quiet
pleasure
at
her
success
and
with
a
charming
affectation
of
seriousness
marked
the
engagement
with
a
big
cross
at
the
same
moment
the
car
slackened
speed
as
the
chauffeur
waited
for
further
orders
lillian
shut
the
and
handed
it
back
where
can
i
drop
you
she
asked
at
the
club
the
question
recalled
him
to
a
sense
of
present
things
he
thrust
the
book
into
his
pocket
and
glanced
about
him
they
had
paused
by
hyde
park
corner
the
crowd
of
horses
and
carriages
had
thinned
as
the
hour
of
lunch
drew
near
and
the
wide
roadway
of
the
park
had
an
air
of
added
space
the
suggested
loneliness
affected
him
the
tall
trees
still
bereft
of
leaves
and
the
colossal
gateway
incomprehensively
stirred
the
sense
of
mental
panic
that
sometimes
seized
him
in
face
of
vastness
of
space
or
of
architecture
in
one
moment
lillian
the
appointment
he
had
just
made
the
manner
of
its
making
all
left
him
the
world
was
filled
with
his
own
personality
his
own
immediate
inclinations
do
bother
about
me
he
said
quickly
i
can
get
out
here
been
very
good
it
been
a
delightful
with
a
hurried
pressure
of
her
fingers
he
rose
and
stepped
from
the
car
reaching
the
ground
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
raised
his
hat
then
without
a
second
glance
he
turned
and
walked
rapidly
away
lillian
sat
watching
him
meditatively
she
saw
him
pass
through
the
gateway
saw
him
hail
a
hansom
then
she
remembered
the
waiting
chauffeur
xxi
on
the
same
day
that
chilcote
had
parted
with
lillian
but
at
three
in
the
afternoon
loder
dressed
in
chilcote
clothes
and
with
chilcote
heavy
overcoat
slung
over
his
arm
walked
from
fleet
street
to
grosvenor
square
he
walked
steadily
neither
slowly
nor
yet
fast
the
elation
of
his
last
journey
over
the
same
ground
was
tempered
by
feelings
he
could
not
satisfactorily
bracket
even
to
himself
there
was
less
of
vehement
elation
and
more
of
matured
determination
in
his
gait
and
bearing
than
there
had
been
on
that
night
though
the
incidents
of
which
they
were
the
outcome
were
very
complex
on
reaching
chilcote
house
he
passed
but
still
following
the
routine
of
his
previous
return
he
did
not
halt
at
chilcote
door
but
moved
onward
towards
eve
and
there
paused
in
that
pause
his
numberless
irregular
thoughts
fused
into
one
he
had
the
same
undefined
sense
of
standing
upon
sacred
ground
that
had
touched
him
on
the
previous
occasion
but
the
outcome
of
the
sensation
was
different
this
time
he
raised
his
hand
almost
immediately
and
tapped
on
the
door
he
waited
but
no
voice
responded
to
his
knock
with
a
sense
of
disappointment
he
knocked
again
then
pressing
his
determination
still
further
he
turned
the
handle
and
entered
the
room
no
private
room
is
without
meaning
whether
trivial
or
the
reverse
in
a
room
perhaps
more
even
than
in
speech
in
look
or
in
work
does
the
impress
of
the
individual
make
itself
felt
there
on
the
wax
of
outer
things
the
inner
self
imprints
its
its
fleeting
claim
to
separate
individuality
this
thought
with
its
arresting
interest
made
loder
walk
slowly
almost
seriously
across
the
room
and
then
pause
to
study
his
surroundings
the
room
was
of
medium
size
not
too
large
for
comfort
and
not
too
small
for
ample
space
at
a
first
impression
it
struck
him
as
unlike
any
anticipation
of
a
woman
sanctum
the
walls
panelled
in
dark
wood
the
richly
bound
books
the
beautifully
designed
bronze
ornaments
even
the
flowers
deep
crimson
and
in
tone
had
an
air
of
sombre
harmony
that
was
scarcely
feminine
with
a
strangely
pleasant
impression
he
realized
this
and
following
his
habitual
impulse
moved
slowly
forward
towards
the
fireplace
and
there
paused
his
elbow
resting
on
the
he
had
scarcely
settled
comfortably
into
his
position
scarcely
entered
on
his
second
and
more
comprehensive
study
of
the
place
than
the
arrangement
of
his
mind
was
altered
by
the
turning
of
the
handle
and
the
opening
of
the
door
the
was
eve
herself
she
was
dressed
in
outdoor
clothes
and
walked
into
the
room
quickly
then
as
loder
had
done
she
too
paused
the
gesture
so
natural
and
spontaneous
had
a
peculiar
attraction
as
she
glanced
up
at
him
her
face
alight
with
inquiry
she
seemed
extraordinarily
much
the
owner
and
designer
of
her
surroundings
she
was
framed
by
them
as
naturally
and
effectively
as
her
eyes
and
her
face
were
framed
by
her
black
hair
for
one
moment
he
forgot
that
his
presence
demanded
explanation
the
next
she
had
made
explanation
needless
she
had
been
looking
at
him
intently
now
she
came
forward
slowly
john
she
said
half
in
appeal
half
in
question
he
took
a
step
towards
her
look
at
me
he
said
quietly
and
involuntarily
in
the
sharp
desire
to
establish
himself
in
her
regard
he
forgot
that
her
eyes
had
never
left
his
face
but
the
incongruity
of
the
words
did
not
strike
her
oh
she
exclaimed
i
i
believe
i
directly
i
saw
you
the
quick
ring
of
life
vibrating
in
her
tone
surprised
him
but
he
had
other
thoughts
more
urgent
than
surprise
in
the
five
days
of
banishment
just
lived
through
the
need
for
a
readjustment
of
his
position
with
regard
to
her
had
come
to
him
forcibly
the
memory
of
the
night
when
weakness
and
he
had
been
at
perilously
close
quarters
had
returned
to
him
persistently
and
uncomfortably
spoiling
the
remembrance
of
his
triumph
it
had
been
well
enough
to
smother
the
thought
of
that
night
in
days
of
work
but
had
the
ignoring
of
it
blotted
out
the
weakness
had
it
not
rather
thrown
it
into
bolder
relief
a
man
strong
in
his
own
strength
does
not
turn
his
back
upon
temptation
he
faces
and
quells
it
in
the
solitary
days
in
clifford
inn
in
the
solitary
spent
in
tramping
the
city
streets
this
had
been
the
conviction
that
had
recurred
again
and
again
this
the
problem
to
which
after
much
consideration
he
had
found
a
solution
satisfactory
at
least
to
himself
when
next
chilcote
called
him
it
was
notable
that
he
had
used
the
word
when
and
not
when
next
chilcote
called
him
he
would
make
a
new
departure
he
would
no
longer
avoid
eve
he
would
successfully
prove
to
himself
that
one
interest
and
one
alone
filled
his
mind
the
pursuance
of
political
career
so
does
man
satisfactorily
convince
himself
against
himself
he
had
this
intention
fully
in
mind
as
he
came
forward
now
well
he
said
slowly
has
it
been
very
hard
to
have
faith
these
last
five
days
it
was
not
precisely
the
tone
he
had
meant
to
adopt
but
one
must
begin
eve
turned
at
his
words
her
eyes
were
brimming
with
life
her
cheeks
still
touched
to
a
deep
soft
color
by
the
keenness
of
the
wintry
air
no
she
answered
with
a
shy
responsive
touch
of
confidence
i
seemed
to
keep
on
believing
you
know
converts
make
the
best
she
laughed
with
slight
embarrassment
and
glanced
up
at
him
something
in
the
blue
of
her
eyes
reminded
him
unexpectedly
of
spring
skies
full
of
youth
and
promise
he
moved
abruptly
and
crossed
the
room
towards
the
window
eve
he
said
without
looking
round
i
want
your
he
heard
the
faint
rustling
of
her
dress
as
she
turned
towards
him
and
he
knew
that
he
had
struck
the
right
chord
all
true
women
respond
to
an
appeal
for
aid
as
steel
answers
to
the
magnet
he
could
feel
her
expectancy
in
the
silence
you
know
we
all
know
that
the
present
moment
is
very
vital
that
impossible
to
deny
the
crisis
in
the
air
nobody
feels
it
more
than
i
do
nobody
is
more
exorbitantly
keen
to
have
a
share
a
part
when
the
real
fight
comes
he
stopped
then
he
turned
slowly
and
their
eyes
met
if
a
man
is
to
succeed
in
such
a
desire
he
went
on
deliberately
he
must
exclude
all
others
he
must
have
one
purpose
one
interest
one
thought
he
must
forget
that
eve
lifted
her
head
quickly
that
he
has
a
wife
she
finished
gently
i
think
i
there
was
no
annoyance
in
her
face
or
voice
no
suggestion
of
selfishness
or
of
hurt
vanity
she
had
read
his
meaning
with
disconcerting
clearness
and
responded
with
disconcerting
generosity
a
sudden
and
very
human
dissatisfaction
with
his
readjustment
scheme
fell
upon
loder
opposition
is
the
whip
to
action
a
acquiescence
the
slackened
rein
did
i
say
that
he
asked
quickly
the
tone
was
almost
chilcote
she
glanced
up
then
a
sudden
incomprehensible
smile
lighted
up
her
face
you
did
say
but
you
thought
she
answered
gravely
thoughts
are
the
same
as
words
to
a
woman
that
why
we
are
so
again
she
smiled
some
idea
baffling
and
incomprehensible
to
loder
was
stirring
in
her
mind
conscious
of
the
impression
he
moved
still
nearer
you
jump
to
conclusions
he
said
abruptly
what
i
meant
to
imply
was
precisely
what
i
again
she
finished
his
sentence
then
she
laughed
softly
how
very
wise
but
how
very
very
foolish
men
are
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
because
a
woman
is
is
interested
in
you
she
is
going
to
hamper
you
in
some
direction
and
after
infinite
pains
you
summon
all
your
tact
and
you
set
about
saving
the
there
was
interest
even
a
touch
of
amusement
in
her
tone
her
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
his
in
an
indefinable
glance
you
think
you
are
being
very
diplomatic
she
went
on
quietly
but
in
reality
you
are
being
very
transparent
the
woman
reads
the
whole
of
your
meaning
in
your
very
first
sentence
if
she
has
known
it
before
you
began
to
again
loder
made
an
interruption
but
again
she
checked
him
no
she
said
still
smiling
you
should
never
attempt
such
a
task
shall
i
tell
you
why
he
stood
silent
puzzled
and
interested
because
she
said
quickly
when
a
woman
really
is
interested
the
man
career
ranks
infinitely
higher
in
her
eyes
than
any
personal
desire
for
for
a
moment
their
eyes
met
then
abruptly
loder
looked
away
she
had
gauged
his
intentions
incorrectly
yet
with
disconcerting
insight
again
the
suggestion
of
an
unusual
personality
below
the
serenity
of
her
manner
recurred
to
his
imagination
with
an
impulse
altogether
foreign
to
him
he
lifted
his
head
and
again
met
her
glance
then
at
last
he
spoke
but
only
two
words
forgive
me
he
said
with
simple
direct
sincerity
xxii
after
his
interview
with
eve
loder
retired
to
the
study
and
spent
the
remaining
hours
of
the
day
and
the
whole
span
of
the
evening
in
work
at
one
still
feeling
fresh
in
mind
and
body
he
dismissed
greening
and
passed
into
chilcote
bedroom
the
interview
with
eve
though
widely
different
from
the
one
he
had
anticipated
had
left
him
stimulated
and
alert
in
the
hours
that
followed
it
there
had
been
an
added
anxiety
to
put
his
mind
into
harness
an
added
gratification
in
finding
it
answer
to
the
rein
a
pleasant
sense
of
retrospection
settled
upon
him
as
he
slowly
undressed
and
a
pleasant
sense
of
interest
touched
him
as
crossing
to
the
he
caught
sight
of
chilcote
taken
with
other
things
from
the
suit
he
had
changed
at
and
carefully
laid
aside
by
renwick
he
picked
it
up
and
slowly
turned
the
pages
it
always
held
the
suggestion
of
a
lottery
this
dipping
into
another
man
engagements
and
drawing
a
prize
or
a
blank
it
was
a
sensation
that
even
custom
had
not
dulled
at
first
he
turned
the
pages
slowly
then
by
degrees
his
fingers
quickened
beyond
the
fact
that
this
present
evening
was
free
he
knew
nothing
of
his
promised
movements
the
abruptness
of
chilcote
arrival
at
clifford
inn
in
the
afternoon
had
left
no
time
for
superfluous
questions
he
skimmed
the
writing
with
a
touch
of
interested
haste
then
all
at
once
he
paused
and
smiled
big
enough
for
a
tombstone
he
said
below
his
breath
as
his
eyes
rested
on
a
large
blue
cross
then
he
smiled
again
and
held
the
book
to
the
light
dine
cadogan
gardens
talk
with
l
he
read
still
speaking
softly
to
himself
he
stood
for
a
moment
pondering
on
the
entry
then
once
more
his
glance
reverted
to
the
cross
evidently
meant
it
to
be
seen
he
mused
but
why
the
deuce
is
he
more
explicit
as
he
spoke
a
look
of
comprehension
suddenly
crossed
his
face
and
the
puzzled
frown
between
his
eyebrows
cleared
away
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
he
remembered
lakely
frequent
and
pressing
suggestion
that
he
should
dine
with
him
at
cadogan
gardens
and
discuss
the
political
outlook
lakely
must
have
written
during
his
absence
and
chilcote
having
marked
the
engagement
felt
no
further
responsibility
the
invitation
could
scarcely
have
been
verbal
as
chilcote
he
knew
had
lain
very
low
in
the
five
days
of
his
return
home
so
he
argued
as
he
stood
with
the
book
still
open
in
his
hands
the
blue
cross
staring
imperatively
from
the
white
paper
and
from
the
argument
rose
thoughts
and
suggestions
that
seethed
in
his
mind
long
after
the
lights
had
been
switched
off
long
after
the
fire
had
died
down
and
he
had
been
left
wrapped
in
darkness
in
the
great
canopied
bed
and
so
it
came
about
that
he
took
his
second
false
step
once
during
the
press
of
the
next
morning
work
it
crossed
his
mind
to
verify
his
convictions
by
a
glance
at
the
directory
but
for
once
the
strong
wish
that
evolves
a
thought
conquered
his
caution
his
work
was
absorbing
the
need
of
verification
seemed
very
small
he
let
the
suggestion
pass
at
seven
he
dressed
carefully
his
mind
was
full
of
lakely
and
of
the
possibilities
the
night
might
hold
for
more
than
once
before
the
weight
of
the
george
gazette
with
lakely
at
its
back
had
turned
the
political
scales
to
be
marked
by
him
as
a
coming
man
was
at
any
time
a
favorable
portent
to
be
singled
out
by
him
at
the
present
juncture
was
momentous
a
thrill
of
expectancy
almost
of
excitement
passed
through
him
as
he
surveyed
his
appearance
preparatory
to
leaving
the
house
passing
he
moved
at
once
to
the
hall
door
but
almost
as
his
hand
touched
it
he
halted
attracted
by
a
movement
on
the
landing
above
him
turning
he
saw
eve
she
was
standing
quite
still
looking
down
upon
him
as
she
had
looked
once
before
as
their
eyes
met
she
changed
her
position
hastily
you
are
going
out
she
asked
and
it
struck
loder
quickly
that
there
was
a
suggestion
a
shadow
of
disappointment
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
moved
by
the
impression
he
responded
with
unusual
promptness
yes
he
said
i
dining
out
dining
with
she
watched
him
intently
while
he
spoke
then
as
the
meaning
of
his
words
reached
her
her
whole
face
brightened
with
lakely
she
said
oh
i
glad
very
glad
it
is
quite
quite
another
she
smiled
with
a
warm
impulsive
touch
of
sympathy
loder
looking
up
at
her
felt
his
senses
stir
at
sound
of
her
words
his
secret
craving
for
success
quickened
to
stronger
life
the
man
whose
sole
incentive
lies
within
may
go
forward
coldly
and
successfully
but
the
man
who
grasps
a
double
inspiration
who
even
unconsciously
is
impelled
by
another
force
has
a
stronger
impetus
for
attack
a
surer
more
vital
hewing
power
still
watching
her
he
answered
instinctively
yes
he
said
slowly
a
long
and
with
a
smile
of
farewell
he
turned
opened
the
door
and
passed
into
the
road
the
thrill
of
that
one
moment
was
still
warm
as
he
reached
cadogan
gardens
and
mounted
the
steps
of
no
so
vitally
warm
that
he
paused
for
an
instant
before
pressing
the
electric
bell
then
at
last
dominated
by
anticipation
he
turned
and
raised
his
hand
the
action
was
abrupt
and
it
was
only
as
his
fingers
pressed
the
bell
that
a
certain
unexpectedness
a
certain
want
of
suitability
in
the
aspect
of
the
house
struck
him
the
door
was
white
the
handle
and
knocker
were
of
massive
silver
the
first
seemed
a
disappointing
index
of
lakely
private
taste
the
second
a
ridiculous
temptation
to
needy
humanity
he
looked
again
at
the
number
of
the
house
but
it
stared
back
at
him
convincingly
then
the
door
opened
so
keen
was
his
sense
of
unfitness
that
still
trying
to
fuse
his
impression
of
lakely
with
the
idea
of
silver
he
stepped
into
the
hall
without
the
usual
preliminary
question
suddenly
realizing
the
necessity
he
turned
to
the
servant
but
the
man
forestalled
him
will
you
come
to
the
white
room
sir
and
may
i
take
your
coat
the
smooth
certainty
of
the
man
manner
surprised
him
it
held
another
savor
of
disappointment
seeming
as
little
in
keeping
with
the
keen
lakely
as
did
the
house
still
struggling
with
his
impression
he
allowed
himself
to
be
relieved
of
his
hat
and
coat
and
in
silence
ushered
up
the
shallow
staircase
as
the
last
step
was
reached
it
came
to
him
again
to
mention
his
name
but
simultaneously
with
the
suggestion
the
servant
stepped
forward
with
a
quick
silent
movement
and
threw
open
a
door
mr
chilcote
he
announced
in
a
subdued
discreet
voice
loder
first
impression
was
of
a
room
that
seemed
unusually
luxurious
soft
and
shadowed
then
all
impression
of
inanimate
things
left
him
suddenly
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
stood
in
the
while
the
room
seemed
emptied
of
everything
except
a
figure
that
rose
slowly
from
a
couch
before
the
fire
at
sound
of
chilcote
name
then
with
a
calmness
that
to
himself
seemed
incredible
he
moved
forward
into
the
room
he
might
of
course
have
beaten
a
retreat
and
obviated
many
things
but
life
is
full
of
and
retreat
never
presents
itself
agreeably
to
a
strong
man
his
impulse
was
to
face
the
difficulty
and
he
acted
on
the
impulse
lillian
had
risen
slowly
and
as
he
neared
her
she
held
out
her
hand
jack
she
exclaimed
softly
how
sweet
of
you
to
remember
the
voice
and
words
came
to
him
with
great
distinctness
and
as
they
came
one
uncertainty
passed
forever
from
his
mind
the
question
as
to
what
relation
she
and
chilcote
held
to
each
other
with
the
realization
came
the
thought
of
eve
and
in
the
midst
of
his
own
difficulty
his
face
hardened
lillian
ignored
the
coldness
taking
his
hand
she
smiled
unusually
punctual
she
said
but
your
hands
are
cold
come
closer
to
the
loder
was
not
sensible
that
his
hands
were
cold
but
he
suffered
himself
to
be
drawn
forward
one
end
of
the
couch
was
in
firelight
the
other
in
shadow
by
a
fortunate
arrangement
of
chance
lillian
selected
the
brighter
end
for
herself
and
offered
the
other
to
her
guest
with
a
quick
sense
of
respite
he
accepted
it
at
least
he
could
sit
secure
from
detection
while
he
temporized
with
fate
for
a
moment
they
sat
silent
then
lillian
stirred
wo
you
smoke
she
asked
everything
in
the
room
seemed
soft
and
enervating
the
subdued
glow
of
the
fire
the
smell
of
roses
that
hung
about
the
air
and
last
of
all
lillian
slow
soothing
voice
with
a
sense
of
oppression
he
stiffened
his
shoulders
and
sat
straighter
in
his
place
no
he
said
i
do
think
i
shall
she
moved
nearer
to
him
dear
jack
she
said
pleadingly
do
say
you
in
a
bad
mood
do
say
you
want
to
postpone
she
looked
up
at
him
and
laughed
a
little
in
mock
consternation
loder
was
at
a
loss
another
silence
followed
while
lillian
waited
then
she
frowned
suddenly
and
rose
from
the
couch
like
many
indolent
people
she
possessed
a
touch
of
obstinacy
and
now
that
her
triumph
over
chilcote
was
obtained
now
that
she
had
vindicated
her
right
to
command
him
her
original
purpose
came
uppermost
again
cold
or
interested
indifferent
or
attentive
she
intended
to
make
use
of
him
she
moved
to
the
fire
and
stood
looking
down
into
it
jack
she
began
gently
a
really
amazing
thing
has
happened
to
me
i
do
so
want
you
to
throw
some
loder
said
nothing
there
was
a
fresh
pause
while
she
softly
smoothed
the
silk
embroidery
that
edged
her
gown
then
once
more
she
looked
up
at
him
did
i
ever
tell
you
she
began
that
i
was
once
in
a
railway
accident
on
a
funny
little
italian
railway
centuries
before
i
met
you
she
laughed
softly
and
with
a
pretty
air
of
confidence
turned
from
the
fire
and
resumed
her
seat
astrupp
had
caught
a
fever
in
florence
and
i
was
rushing
away
for
fear
of
the
infection
when
our
stupid
little
train
ran
off
the
rails
near
pistoria
and
smashed
itself
up
fortunately
we
were
within
half
a
mile
of
a
village
so
we
were
quite
bereft
the
village
was
impossibly
like
a
toy
village
and
the
accommodation
what
one
would
expect
in
a
noah
ark
but
it
was
all
absolutely
picturesque
i
put
up
at
the
little
inn
with
my
maid
and
ko
ko
ko
ko
was
such
a
sweet
dog
a
white
poodle
i
was
tremendously
keen
on
poodles
that
she
stopped
and
looked
thoughtfully
towards
the
fire
but
to
come
to
the
point
of
the
story
jack
the
toy
village
had
a
boy
doll
she
laughed
again
he
was
an
englishman
and
the
first
person
to
come
to
my
rescue
on
the
night
of
the
he
was
staying
at
the
noah
ark
inn
and
after
that
first
night
i
he
we
oh
jack
you
any
imagination
her
voice
sounded
petulant
and
sharp
the
man
who
is
indifferent
to
the
recital
of
an
old
love
affair
implies
the
worst
kind
of
listener
i
believe
you
are
interested
she
added
in
another
and
more
reproachful
tone
he
leaned
forward
you
wrong
there
he
said
slowly
i
deeply
she
glanced
at
him
again
his
tone
reassured
her
but
his
words
left
her
uncertain
chilcote
was
rarely
emphatic
with
a
touch
of
hesitation
she
went
on
with
her
tale
as
i
told
you
he
was
the
first
to
find
us
to
find
me
i
should
say
for
my
stupid
maid
was
having
hysterics
farther
up
the
line
and
ko
ko
was
lost
i
remember
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
send
him
in
search
of
ko
ko
notwithstanding
his
position
loder
found
occasion
to
smile
did
he
succeed
he
said
dryly
succeed
oh
yes
he
she
also
smiled
involuntarily
poor
ko
ko
was
stowed
away
under
the
and
after
quite
a
lot
of
trouble
he
pulled
him
out
when
it
was
all
done
the
dog
was
quite
unhurt
and
livelier
than
ever
but
the
englishman
had
his
finger
almost
bitten
through
ko
ko
was
a
dear
but
his
teeth
and
his
temper
were
both
very
sharp
she
laughed
once
more
in
soft
amusement
loder
was
silent
for
a
second
then
he
too
laughed
chilcote
short
sarcastic
laugh
and
you
tied
up
the
wound
i
suppose
she
glanced
up
half
displeased
we
were
both
staying
at
the
little
inn
she
said
as
though
no
further
explanation
could
be
needed
then
again
her
manner
changed
she
moved
imperceptibly
nearer
and
touched
his
right
hand
his
left
which
was
farther
away
from
her
was
well
in
the
shadow
of
the
cushions
jack
she
said
caressingly
it
is
to
tell
you
this
stupid
old
story
that
i
brought
you
here
it
really
to
tell
you
a
sort
of
she
stroked
his
hand
gently
once
or
twice
as
i
say
i
met
this
man
and
we
we
had
an
affair
you
understand
then
we
quarrelled
quarrelled
quite
badly
and
i
came
away
i
remembered
him
rather
longer
than
i
remember
most
people
he
was
one
of
those
dogged
individuals
who
stick
in
one
mind
but
he
has
stayed
in
mine
for
another
reason
again
she
looked
up
he
has
stayed
because
you
helped
to
keep
him
there
you
know
how
i
have
sometimes
put
my
hands
over
your
mouth
and
told
you
that
your
eyes
reminded
me
of
some
one
else
well
that
some
one
else
was
my
englishman
but
you
must
be
jealous
he
was
a
horrid
obstinate
person
and
you
well
you
know
what
i
think
of
you
she
pressed
his
hand
but
to
come
to
the
end
of
the
story
i
never
saw
this
man
since
that
time
until
until
the
night
of
blanche
party
she
spoke
slowly
to
give
full
effect
to
her
words
then
she
waited
for
his
surprise
but
the
result
was
not
what
she
expected
he
said
nothing
and
with
an
abrupt
movement
he
drew
his
hand
from
between
hers
are
you
surprised
she
asked
at
last
with
a
delicate
note
of
reproof
he
started
slightly
as
if
recalled
to
the
necessity
of
the
moment
surprised
he
said
why
should
i
be
surprised
one
person
more
or
less
at
a
big
party
is
astonishing
besides
you
expect
a
man
to
turn
up
sooner
or
later
in
his
own
country
why
should
i
be
surprised
she
lay
back
luxuriously
because
my
dear
boy
she
said
softly
it
a
mystery
it
one
of
those
fascinating
mysteries
that
come
once
in
a
loder
made
no
movement
you
must
explain
he
said
very
quietly
lillian
smiled
that
just
what
i
want
to
do
when
i
was
in
my
tent
on
the
night
of
blanche
party
a
man
came
to
be
gazed
for
he
came
just
like
anybody
else
and
laid
his
hands
upon
the
table
he
had
strong
thin
hands
like
well
rather
like
yours
but
he
wore
two
rings
on
the
third
finger
of
his
left
hand
a
heavy
and
a
plain
gold
loder
moved
his
hand
imperceptibly
till
the
cushion
covered
it
lillian
words
caused
him
no
surprise
scarcely
even
any
trepidation
he
felt
now
that
he
had
expected
them
even
waited
for
them
all
along
i
asked
him
to
take
off
his
rings
she
went
on
and
just
for
a
second
he
hesitated
i
could
feel
him
hesitate
then
he
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
for
he
drew
them
off
he
drew
them
off
jack
and
guess
what
i
saw
do
guess
for
the
first
time
loder
involuntarily
drew
back
into
his
corner
of
the
couch
i
never
guess
he
said
brusquely
then
i
tell
you
his
hands
were
the
hands
of
my
englishman
the
rings
covered
the
scar
made
by
ko
ko
teeth
i
knew
it
instantly
the
second
my
eyes
rested
on
it
it
was
the
same
scar
that
i
had
bound
up
dozens
of
times
that
i
had
seen
healed
before
i
left
and
you
what
did
you
do
loder
felt
it
singularly
difficult
and
unpleasant
to
speak
ah
that
the
point
that
where
i
was
stupid
and
made
my
mistake
i
should
have
spoken
to
him
on
the
moment
but
i
did
you
know
how
one
sometimes
hesitates
afterwards
it
was
too
but
you
saw
him
afterwards
in
the
rooms
loder
spoke
unwillingly
no
i
did
that
the
other
point
i
did
see
him
in
the
rooms
and
i
have
seen
him
since
directly
he
was
gone
i
left
the
tent
i
pretended
to
be
hungry
and
bored
but
though
i
went
through
every
room
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
once
she
hesitated
and
laughed
again
once
i
thought
i
had
found
him
but
it
was
only
you
you
as
you
stood
in
that
with
your
mouth
and
chin
hidden
by
leonard
kaine
head
was
it
a
quaint
mistake
there
was
an
uncertain
pause
then
loder
feeling
the
need
of
speech
broke
the
silence
suddenly
where
do
i
come
in
he
asked
abruptly
what
am
i
wanted
for
to
help
to
throw
light
on
the
mystery
i
seen
blanche
list
of
people
and
there
was
a
man
i
could
place
no
outsider
ever
squeezes
through
blanche
door
i
have
questioned
bobby
blessington
but
he
ca
remember
who
came
to
the
tent
last
and
bobby
was
supposed
to
have
kept
count
she
spoke
in
deep
scorn
but
almost
immediately
the
scorn
faded
and
she
smiled
again
now
that
i
explain
ed
jack
she
added
what
do
you
suggest
then
for
the
first
time
loder
knew
what
his
presence
in
the
room
really
meant
and
at
best
the
knowledge
was
disconcerting
it
is
not
every
day
that
a
man
is
called
upon
to
unearth
himself
suggest
he
repeated
blankly
yes
i
rather
have
your
idea
of
the
affair
than
anybody
else
you
are
so
dear
and
sarcastic
and
keen
that
you
ca
help
getting
straight
at
the
middle
of
a
when
lillian
wanted
anything
she
could
be
very
sweet
she
suddenly
dropped
her
tone
she
suddenly
ceased
to
be
a
spoiled
child
with
a
perfectly
graceful
movement
she
drew
quite
close
to
loder
and
slid
gently
to
her
knees
this
is
an
attitude
that
few
women
can
safely
assume
it
requires
all
the
attributes
of
youth
suppleness
and
a
certain
buoyant
ease
but
lillian
never
acted
without
justification
and
as
she
leaned
towards
loder
her
face
lifted
her
slight
figure
and
pale
hair
softened
by
the
firelight
she
made
a
picture
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
criticise
but
the
person
who
should
have
appreciated
it
stared
steadily
beyond
it
to
the
fire
his
mind
was
absorbed
by
one
question
the
question
of
how
he
might
reasonably
leave
the
house
before
discovery
became
assured
lillian
attentively
watchful
of
him
saw
the
uneasy
look
and
her
own
face
fell
but
as
she
looked
an
inspiration
came
to
her
a
remembrance
of
many
interviews
with
chilcote
smoothed
and
facilitated
by
the
timely
use
of
tobacco
jack
she
said
softly
before
you
say
another
word
i
insist
on
your
lighting
a
she
leaned
forward
resting
against
his
knee
at
her
words
loder
eyes
left
the
fire
his
attention
was
suddenly
needed
for
a
new
and
more
imminent
difficulty
thanks
he
said
quickly
i
have
no
wish
to
it
is
a
matter
of
what
you
wish
but
of
what
i
she
smiled
she
knew
that
chilcote
with
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
was
infinitely
more
tractable
than
chilcote
sitting
idle
and
she
had
no
intention
of
ignoring
the
knowledge
but
loder
caught
at
her
words
before
you
ordered
me
to
smoke
he
said
you
told
me
to
give
you
some
advice
your
first
command
must
have
prior
he
grasped
unhesitatingly
at
the
less
risky
theme
she
looked
up
at
him
you
always
nicer
when
you
smoke
she
persisted
caressingly
light
a
cigarette
and
give
me
loder
mouth
became
set
no
he
said
we
stick
to
this
advice
business
it
interests
yes
no
now
you
want
to
find
out
why
this
englishman
from
italy
was
at
your
sister
party
and
why
he
disappeared
there
are
times
when
a
malignant
obstinacy
seems
to
affect
certain
people
the
only
answer
lillian
made
was
to
pass
her
hand
over
waistcoat
and
feeling
his
to
draw
it
from
the
pocket
he
affected
not
to
see
it
do
you
think
he
recognized
you
in
that
tent
he
insisted
desperately
she
held
out
the
case
here
are
your
cigarettes
you
know
we
always
more
social
when
we
in
the
short
interval
while
she
looked
up
into
his
face
several
ideas
passed
through
loder
mind
he
thought
of
standing
up
suddenly
and
so
regaining
his
advantage
he
wondered
quickly
whether
one
hand
could
possibly
suffice
for
the
taking
out
and
lighting
of
two
cigarettes
then
all
need
for
speculation
was
pushed
suddenly
aside
lillian
looking
into
his
face
saw
his
fresh
look
of
disturbance
and
from
long
experience
again
changed
her
tactics
laying
the
on
the
couch
she
put
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
other
on
his
left
arm
hundreds
of
times
this
caressing
touch
had
quieted
chilcote
dear
old
boy
she
said
soothingly
her
hand
moving
slowly
down
his
arm
in
a
flash
of
understanding
the
consequences
of
this
position
came
to
him
action
was
imperative
at
whatever
risk
with
an
abrupt
gesture
he
rose
the
movement
was
awkward
he
got
to
his
feet
precipitately
lillian
drew
back
surprised
and
startled
catching
involuntarily
at
his
left
hand
to
steady
her
position
her
fingers
grasped
at
then
held
his
he
made
no
effort
to
release
them
with
a
dogged
acknowledgment
he
admitted
himself
worsted
how
long
she
stayed
immovable
holding
his
hand
neither
of
them
knew
the
process
of
a
woman
instinct
is
so
subtle
so
obscure
that
it
would
be
futile
to
apply
to
it
the
commonplace
test
of
time
she
kept
her
hold
tenaciously
as
though
his
fingers
possessed
some
peculiar
virtue
then
at
last
she
spoke
rings
jack
she
said
very
slowly
and
under
the
two
short
words
a
whole
world
of
incredulity
and
surmise
made
itself
felt
loder
laughed
at
the
sound
she
dropped
his
hand
and
rose
from
her
knees
what
her
suspicions
what
her
instincts
were
she
could
not
have
clearly
defined
but
her
action
was
unhesitating
without
a
moment
uncertainty
she
turned
to
the
fireplace
pressed
the
electric
button
and
flooded
the
room
with
light
there
is
no
force
so
demoralizing
as
unexpected
light
loder
took
a
step
backward
his
hand
hanging
unguarded
by
his
side
and
lillian
stepping
forward
caught
it
again
before
he
could
protest
lifting
it
quickly
she
looked
scrutinizingly
at
the
two
rings
all
women
jump
to
conclusions
and
it
is
extraordinary
how
seldom
they
jump
short
seeing
only
what
lillian
saw
knowing
only
what
she
knew
no
man
would
have
staked
a
definite
opinion
but
the
other
sex
takes
a
different
view
as
she
stood
gazing
at
the
rings
her
thoughts
and
her
conclusions
sped
through
her
mind
like
arrows
all
aimed
and
all
tending
towards
one
point
she
remembered
the
day
when
she
and
chilcote
had
talked
of
doubles
her
scepticism
and
his
vehement
defence
of
the
idea
his
sudden
interest
in
the
book
men
shoes
and
his
anathema
against
life
and
its
irksome
round
of
duties
she
remembered
her
own
first
convinced
recognition
of
the
eyes
that
had
looked
at
her
in
the
doorway
of
her
sister
house
and
last
of
all
she
remembered
chilcote
unaccountable
avoidance
of
the
same
subject
of
likenesses
when
she
had
mentioned
it
yesterday
driving
through
the
park
and
with
it
his
unnecessarily
curt
repudiation
of
his
former
opinions
she
reviewed
each
item
then
she
raised
her
head
slowly
and
looked
at
loder
he
was
prepared
for
the
glance
and
met
it
steadily
in
the
long
moment
that
her
eyes
searched
his
face
it
was
she
and
not
he
who
changed
color
she
was
the
first
to
speak
you
were
the
man
whose
hands
i
saw
in
the
tent
she
said
she
made
the
statement
in
her
usual
soft
tones
but
a
slight
tremor
of
excitement
underran
her
voice
poodles
persian
kittens
even
crystal
seemed
very
far
away
in
face
of
this
tangible
fabulous
present
interest
you
are
not
jack
chilcote
she
said
very
slowly
you
are
wearing
his
clothes
and
speaking
in
his
voice
but
you
are
not
jack
her
tone
quickened
with
a
touch
of
excitement
you
need
keep
silent
and
look
at
me
she
said
i
know
quite
well
what
i
am
saying
though
i
do
understand
it
though
i
have
no
real
proof
she
paused
momentarily
disconcerted
by
her
companion
silent
and
steady
gaze
and
in
the
pause
a
curious
and
unexpected
thing
occurred
loder
laughed
suddenly
a
full
confident
reassured
laugh
all
the
web
that
the
past
had
spun
about
him
all
the
intolerable
sense
of
an
impending
crash
lifted
suddenly
he
saw
his
way
clearly
and
it
was
lillian
who
had
opened
his
eyes
still
looking
at
her
he
smiled
a
smile
of
reliant
determination
such
as
chilcote
had
never
worn
in
his
life
and
with
a
calm
gesture
he
released
his
hand
the
greatest
charm
of
woman
is
her
imagination
he
said
quietly
without
it
there
would
be
no
color
in
life
we
would
come
into
and
drop
out
of
it
with
the
same
uninteresting
tone
of
drab
he
paused
and
smiled
again
at
his
smile
lillian
involuntarily
drew
back
the
color
deepening
in
her
cheeks
why
do
you
say
that
she
asked
he
lifted
his
head
with
each
moment
he
felt
more
certain
of
himself
because
that
is
my
attitude
he
said
as
a
man
i
admire
your
imagination
but
as
a
man
i
fail
to
follow
your
the
words
and
the
tone
both
stung
her
do
you
realize
the
position
she
asked
sharply
do
you
realize
that
whatever
your
plans
are
i
can
spoil
them
loder
still
met
her
eyes
i
realize
nothing
of
the
sort
he
said
then
you
admit
that
you
are
not
jack
chilcote
i
neither
deny
nor
admit
my
identity
is
obvious
i
can
get
twenty
men
to
swear
to
it
at
any
moment
that
you
like
the
fact
that
i
have
worn
rings
till
now
will
scarcely
interest
but
you
do
admit
to
me
that
you
are
not
jack
i
deny
nothing
and
admit
nothing
i
still
offer
my
upon
what
the
same
possession
your
lillian
stamped
her
foot
then
by
a
quick
effort
she
conquered
her
temper
prove
me
to
be
wrong
she
said
with
a
fresh
touch
of
excitement
take
off
your
rings
and
let
me
see
your
with
a
deliberate
gesture
loder
put
his
hand
behind
his
back
i
never
gratify
childish
curiosity
he
said
with
another
smile
again
a
flash
of
temper
crossed
her
eyes
are
you
sure
she
said
that
it
quite
wise
to
talk
like
that
loder
laughed
again
is
that
a
threat
then
it
an
empty
why
before
replying
he
waited
a
moment
looking
down
at
her
i
conclude
he
began
quietly
that
your
idea
is
to
spread
this
wild
improbable
story
to
ask
people
to
believe
that
john
chilcote
whom
they
see
before
them
is
not
john
chilcote
but
somebody
else
now
find
that
a
harder
task
than
you
imagine
this
is
a
sceptical
world
and
people
are
absurdly
fond
of
their
own
eyesight
we
are
all
journalists
nowadays
we
all
want
facts
the
first
thing
you
will
be
asked
for
is
your
proof
and
what
does
your
proof
consist
of
the
circumstance
that
john
chilcote
who
has
always
despised
jewelry
has
lately
taken
to
wearing
rings
your
own
statement
unattended
by
any
witnesses
that
with
those
rings
off
his
finger
bears
a
scar
belonging
to
another
man
no
on
close
examination
i
scarcely
imagine
that
your
case
would
he
stopped
fired
by
his
own
logic
the
future
might
be
but
the
present
was
his
and
this
present
with
its
immeasurable
possibilities
had
been
rescued
from
catastrophe
no
he
said
again
when
you
get
your
proof
perhaps
we
have
another
talk
but
till
then
till
then
she
looked
up
quickly
but
almost
at
once
her
question
died
away
the
door
had
opened
and
the
servant
who
had
admitted
loder
stood
in
the
opening
dinner
is
served
he
announced
in
his
deferential
voice
xxiii
and
loder
dined
with
lillian
astrupp
we
live
in
an
age
when
society
expects
even
exacts
much
he
dined
not
through
bravado
and
not
through
cowardice
but
because
it
seemed
the
obvious
the
only
thing
to
do
to
him
a
scene
of
any
description
was
distasteful
to
lillian
it
was
unknown
in
her
world
people
loved
or
hated
were
spiteful
or
foolish
were
even
quixotic
or
dishonorable
but
they
seldom
made
scenes
loder
tacitly
saw
and
tacitly
accepted
this
possibly
they
ate
extremely
little
during
the
course
of
the
dinner
and
talked
extraordinarily
much
on
subjects
that
interested
neither
but
the
main
point
at
least
was
gained
they
dined
the
conventionalities
were
appeased
the
silent
watchful
servants
who
waited
on
them
were
given
no
food
for
comment
the
fact
that
loder
left
immediately
after
dinner
the
fact
that
he
paused
on
the
after
the
hall
door
had
closed
behind
him
and
drew
a
long
deep
breath
of
relief
held
only
an
individual
significance
and
therefore
did
not
count
on
reaching
chilcote
house
he
passed
at
once
to
the
study
and
dismissed
greening
for
the
night
but
scarcely
had
he
taken
advantage
of
his
solitude
by
settling
into
an
and
lighting
a
cigar
than
renwick
displaying
an
unusual
amount
of
haste
and
importance
entered
the
room
carrying
a
letter
seeing
loder
he
came
forward
at
once
mr
fraide
man
brought
this
sir
he
explained
he
was
most
particular
to
give
it
into
my
hands
making
sure
reach
you
he
waiting
for
an
answer
loder
rose
and
took
the
letter
a
quick
thrill
of
speculation
and
interest
springing
across
his
mind
during
his
time
of
banishment
he
had
followed
the
political
situation
with
feverish
attention
insupportably
chafed
by
the
desire
to
share
in
it
apprehensively
chilled
at
the
thought
of
chilcote
possible
behavior
he
knew
that
in
the
comparatively
short
interval
since
parliament
had
risen
no
act
of
aggression
had
marked
the
russian
occupation
of
meshed
but
he
also
knew
that
fraide
and
his
followers
looked
askance
at
that
great
amiable
attitude
and
at
sight
of
his
leader
message
his
intuition
stirred
turning
to
the
nearest
lamp
he
tore
the
envelope
open
and
scanned
the
letter
anxiously
it
was
written
in
fraide
own
clear
somewhat
writing
and
opened
with
a
kindly
rebuke
for
his
desertion
of
him
since
the
day
of
his
speech
then
immediately
and
with
characteristic
clearness
it
opened
up
the
subject
nearest
the
mind
very
slowly
and
attentively
loder
read
the
letter
and
with
the
extreme
quiet
that
with
him
invariably
covered
emotion
he
moved
to
the
desk
wrote
a
note
and
handed
it
to
the
waiting
servant
as
the
man
turned
towards
the
door
he
called
him
renwick
he
said
sharply
when
you
given
that
letter
to
fraide
servant
ask
chilcote
if
she
can
spare
me
five
when
renwick
had
gone
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
loder
paced
the
room
with
feverish
activity
in
one
moment
the
aspect
of
life
had
been
changed
five
minutes
since
he
had
been
glorying
in
the
risk
of
a
barely
saved
situation
now
that
situation
with
its
merely
social
complications
had
become
a
matter
of
small
importance
his
long
striding
steps
had
carried
him
to
the
fireplace
and
his
back
was
towards
the
door
when
at
last
the
handle
turned
he
wheeled
round
to
receive
eve
message
then
a
look
of
pleased
surprise
crossed
his
face
it
was
eve
herself
who
stood
in
the
doorway
without
hesitation
his
lips
parted
eve
he
said
abruptly
i
have
had
great
news
russia
has
shown
her
teeth
at
last
two
caravans
belonging
to
a
british
trader
were
yesterday
interfered
with
by
a
band
of
cossacks
the
affair
occurred
a
couple
of
miles
outside
meshed
the
traders
remonstrated
but
the
russians
made
summary
use
of
their
advantage
two
englishmen
were
wounded
and
one
of
them
has
since
died
fraide
has
only
now
received
the
news
which
can
not
be
overrated
it
gives
the
precise
lever
necessary
for
the
big
move
at
the
he
spoke
with
great
earnestness
and
unusual
haste
as
he
finished
he
took
a
step
forward
but
that
not
all
he
added
fraide
wants
the
great
move
set
in
motion
by
a
great
speech
and
he
has
asked
me
to
make
for
a
moment
eve
waited
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
and
in
that
silence
he
read
in
her
eyes
the
reflection
of
his
own
expression
and
you
she
asked
in
a
suppressed
voice
what
answer
did
you
give
he
watched
her
for
an
instant
taking
a
strange
pleasure
in
her
flushed
face
and
brilliantly
eager
eyes
then
the
joy
of
conscious
strength
the
sense
of
opportunity
regained
swept
all
other
considerations
out
of
sight
i
accepted
he
said
quickly
could
any
man
who
was
merely
human
have
done
otherwise
that
was
loder
attitude
and
action
on
the
night
of
his
jeopardy
and
his
success
and
the
following
day
found
his
mood
unchanged
he
was
one
of
those
rare
individuals
who
never
give
a
promise
overnight
and
regret
it
in
the
morning
he
was
slow
to
move
but
when
he
did
the
movement
brushed
all
obstacles
aside
in
the
first
days
of
his
usurpation
he
had
gone
cautiously
half
fascinated
half
distrustful
then
the
reality
the
extraordinary
tangibility
of
the
position
had
gripped
him
when
matching
himself
for
the
first
time
with
men
of
his
own
caliber
he
had
learned
his
real
weight
on
the
day
of
his
protest
against
the
easter
adjournment
with
that
knowledge
had
been
born
the
dominant
factor
in
his
whole
scheme
the
overwhelming
insistent
desire
to
manifest
his
power
that
desire
that
is
the
salvation
or
the
ruin
of
every
strong
man
who
has
once
realized
his
strength
supremacy
was
the
note
to
which
his
ambition
reached
to
trample
out
chilcote
footmarks
with
his
own
had
been
his
tacit
instinct
from
the
first
now
it
rose
paramount
it
was
the
whole
theory
of
creation
the
survival
of
the
fittest
the
deep
egotistical
certainty
that
he
was
the
better
man
and
it
was
with
this
conviction
that
he
entered
on
the
vital
period
of
his
dual
career
the
imminent
crisis
and
his
own
share
in
it
absorbed
him
absolutely
in
the
weeks
that
followed
his
answer
to
fraide
proposal
he
gave
himself
ungrudgingly
to
his
work
he
wrote
read
and
planned
with
tireless
energy
he
frequently
forgot
to
eat
and
slept
only
through
sheer
exhaustion
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
he
lived
for
the
culminating
hour
that
was
to
bring
him
failure
or
success
he
seldom
left
grosvenor
square
in
the
days
that
followed
except
to
confer
with
his
party
all
his
interest
all
his
relaxation
even
lay
in
his
work
and
what
pertained
to
it
his
strength
was
like
a
solid
wall
his
intelligence
was
sharp
and
keen
as
steel
the
moment
was
his
and
by
sheer
mastery
of
will
he
put
other
considerations
out
of
sight
he
forgot
chilcote
and
forgot
lillian
not
because
they
escaped
his
memory
but
because
he
chose
to
shut
them
from
it
of
eve
he
saw
but
little
in
this
time
of
high
pressure
when
a
man
touches
the
core
of
his
capacities
puts
his
best
into
the
work
that
in
his
eyes
stands
paramount
there
is
little
place
for
and
no
need
of
woman
she
comes
before
and
after
she
inspires
compensates
or
completes
but
the
achievement
the
creation
is
man
alone
and
all
true
women
understand
and
yield
to
this
unspoken
precept
eve
watched
the
progress
of
his
labor
and
in
the
depth
of
her
own
heart
the
watching
came
nearer
to
actual
living
than
any
activity
she
had
known
she
was
an
but
an
who
stood
as
it
were
on
the
steps
of
the
arena
who
by
a
single
forward
movement
could
feel
the
sand
under
her
feet
the
breath
of
the
battle
on
her
face
and
in
this
knowledge
she
rested
satisfied
there
were
hours
when
loder
seemed
scarcely
conscious
of
her
existence
but
on
those
occasions
she
smiled
in
her
serene
way
and
went
on
waiting
she
knew
that
each
day
before
the
afternoon
had
passed
he
would
come
into
her
his
face
thoughtful
his
hands
full
of
books
or
papers
and
dropping
into
one
of
the
comfortable
studious
chairs
would
ask
laconically
for
tea
this
was
her
moment
of
triumph
and
recompense
for
the
very
unconsciousness
of
his
coming
doubled
its
value
he
would
sit
for
half
an
hour
with
a
preoccupied
glance
or
with
keen
alert
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
while
his
ideas
sorted
themselves
and
fell
into
line
sometimes
he
was
silent
for
the
whole
sometimes
he
commented
to
himself
as
he
scanned
his
notes
but
on
other
and
rarer
occasions
he
talked
speaking
his
thoughts
and
his
theories
aloud
with
the
enjoyment
of
a
man
who
knows
himself
fully
in
his
depth
while
eve
sipped
her
tea
or
stitched
peacefully
at
a
strip
of
embroidery
on
these
occasions
she
made
a
perfect
listener
here
and
there
she
encouraged
him
with
an
intelligent
remark
but
she
never
interrupted
she
knew
when
to
be
silent
and
when
to
speak
when
to
merge
her
own
individuality
and
when
to
make
it
felt
in
these
days
of
stress
and
preparation
he
came
to
her
unconsciously
for
rest
he
treated
her
as
he
might
have
treated
a
younger
brother
relying
on
her
discretion
turning
to
her
as
by
right
for
sympathy
comprehension
and
friendship
sometimes
as
they
sat
silent
in
the
richly
colored
homelike
room
eve
would
pause
over
her
embroidery
and
let
her
thoughts
spin
momentarily
forward
spin
towards
the
point
where
the
brunt
of
his
ordeal
passed
he
must
of
necessity
seek
something
beyond
mere
rest
but
there
her
thoughts
would
inevitably
break
off
and
the
blood
flame
quickly
into
her
cheek
meanwhile
loder
worked
persistently
with
each
day
that
brought
the
crisis
of
fraide
scheme
nearer
his
activity
increased
and
with
it
an
intensifying
of
the
nervous
strain
for
if
he
had
his
hours
of
exaltation
he
also
had
his
hours
of
black
apprehension
it
is
all
very
well
to
exorcise
a
ghost
by
sheer
strength
of
will
but
one
has
also
to
eliminate
the
idea
that
gave
it
existence
lillian
astrupp
with
her
unattested
evidence
and
her
ephemeral
interest
gave
him
no
real
uneasiness
but
chilcote
and
chilcote
possible
summons
were
matters
of
graver
consideration
and
there
were
times
when
they
loomed
very
dark
and
sinister
what
if
at
the
very
moment
of
fulfilment
but
invariably
he
snapped
the
thread
of
the
supposition
and
turned
with
fiercer
ardor
to
his
work
of
preparation
and
so
the
last
morning
of
his
probation
dawned
and
for
the
first
time
he
breathed
freely
he
rose
early
on
the
day
that
was
to
witness
his
great
effort
and
dressed
slowly
it
was
a
splendid
morning
the
spirit
of
the
spring
seemed
embodied
in
the
air
in
the
sky
in
the
shafts
of
cool
sunshine
that
danced
from
the
mirror
to
the
from
the
to
the
pictures
on
the
walls
of
chilcote
vast
room
inconsequently
with
its
dancing
rose
a
memory
of
the
distant
past
a
memory
of
days
when
as
a
child
he
had
been
bidden
to
watch
the
same
sun
perform
the
same
fantastic
evolutions
the
sight
and
the
thought
stirred
him
curiously
with
an
sense
of
youth
he
drew
himself
together
with
an
added
touch
of
decision
as
he
passed
out
into
the
corridor
and
as
he
walked
he
whistled
a
bar
or
two
of
an
inspiriting
tune
in
the
eve
was
already
waiting
she
looked
up
colored
and
smiled
as
he
entered
her
face
looked
very
fresh
and
young
and
she
wore
a
gown
of
the
same
pale
blue
that
she
had
worn
on
his
first
coming
she
looked
up
from
an
open
letter
as
he
came
into
the
room
and
the
sun
that
fell
through
the
window
caught
her
in
a
shaft
of
light
intensifying
her
blue
eyes
her
blue
gown
and
the
bunch
of
violets
fastened
in
her
belt
to
loder
still
under
the
influence
of
early
memories
she
seemed
the
embodiment
of
some
youthful
ideal
something
lost
sought
for
and
found
again
realization
of
his
feeling
for
her
almost
came
to
him
as
he
stood
there
looking
at
her
it
hovered
about
him
it
tipped
him
as
it
were
with
its
wings
then
it
rose
again
and
soared
away
men
like
him
men
keen
to
grasp
an
opening
where
their
careers
are
concerned
and
tenacious
to
hold
it
when
once
grasped
are
frequently
the
last
to
look
into
their
own
hearts
he
glanced
at
eve
he
acknowledged
the
stir
of
his
feeling
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
define
its
cause
he
could
no
more
have
given
reason
for
his
sensations
than
he
could
have
told
the
precise
date
upon
which
coming
at
eight
he
had
first
found
her
waiting
breakfast
for
him
the
time
when
all
such
incidents
were
to
stand
out
each
to
a
nicety
in
its
appointed
place
had
not
yet
arrived
for
the
moment
his
youth
had
returned
to
him
he
possessed
the
knowledge
of
work
done
the
sense
of
present
companionship
in
a
world
of
agreeable
things
above
all
the
steady
quiet
conviction
of
his
own
capacity
all
these
things
came
to
him
in
the
moment
of
his
entering
the
room
greeting
eve
and
passing
to
the
then
while
his
eyes
still
rested
contentedly
on
the
pleasant
array
of
china
and
silver
while
his
senses
were
still
alive
to
the
fresh
earthly
scent
of
eve
violets
the
blow
so
long
dreaded
so
slow
in
coming
fell
with
accumulated
force
xxiv
the
letter
through
which
the
blow
fell
was
not
voluminous
it
was
written
on
cheap
paper
in
a
disguised
hand
and
the
contents
covered
only
half
a
page
loder
read
it
slowly
mentally
articulating
every
word
then
he
laid
it
down
and
as
he
did
so
he
caught
eve
eyes
raised
in
concern
again
he
saw
something
of
his
own
feelings
reflected
in
her
face
and
the
shock
braced
him
he
picked
up
the
letter
tearing
it
into
strips
i
must
go
out
he
said
slowly
i
must
go
now
at
his
voice
was
hard
eve
surprised
concerned
eyes
still
searched
his
now
at
once
she
repeated
now
without
breakfast
i
not
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
carrying
the
slips
of
paper
across
the
room
dropped
them
into
the
fire
he
did
it
not
so
much
from
caution
as
from
an
imperative
wish
to
do
something
to
move
if
only
across
the
room
eve
glance
followed
him
is
it
bad
news
she
asked
anxiously
it
was
unlike
her
to
be
insistent
but
she
was
moved
to
the
impulse
by
the
peculiarity
of
the
moment
no
he
said
shortly
it
business
this
was
written
yesterday
i
should
have
got
it
last
her
eyes
widened
but
nobody
does
business
at
eight
in
the
morning
she
began
in
astonishment
then
she
suddenly
broke
off
without
apology
or
farewell
loder
had
left
the
fireplace
and
walked
out
of
the
room
he
passed
through
the
hall
hurriedly
picking
up
a
hat
as
he
went
and
reaching
the
pavement
outside
he
went
straight
forward
until
grosvenor
square
was
left
behind
then
he
ran
at
the
risk
of
reputation
at
the
loss
of
dignity
he
ran
until
he
saw
a
cab
hailing
it
he
sprang
inside
and
as
the
cabman
whipped
up
and
the
horse
responded
to
the
call
he
realized
for
the
first
time
the
full
significance
of
what
had
occurred
realization
like
the
need
for
action
came
to
him
slowly
but
when
it
came
it
was
with
terrible
lucidity
he
did
not
swear
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
mechanically
watching
the
stream
of
men
on
their
way
to
business
the
belated
cars
of
green
produce
blocking
the
way
between
the
strand
and
covent
garden
he
had
no
use
for
oaths
his
feelings
lay
deeper
than
mere
words
but
his
mouth
was
sternly
set
and
his
eyes
looked
cold
outside
the
law
courts
he
dismissed
his
cab
and
walked
forward
to
clifford
inn
as
he
passed
through
the
familiar
entrance
a
chill
fell
on
him
in
the
clear
early
light
it
seemed
more
than
ever
a
place
of
dead
hopes
dead
enterprises
dead
ambitions
in
the
onward
march
of
life
it
had
been
forgotten
the
very
air
had
a
breath
of
unfulfilment
he
crossed
the
court
rapidly
but
his
mouth
set
itself
afresh
as
he
passed
through
the
of
his
own
house
and
crossed
the
bare
hall
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
he
received
his
first
indication
of
life
in
the
appearance
of
a
cat
from
the
rooms
at
sight
of
him
the
animal
came
forward
rubbed
demonstratively
against
his
legs
and
with
affectionate
persistence
followed
him
outside
his
door
he
paused
on
the
ground
stood
the
usual
morning
can
of
milk
evidence
that
chilcote
was
not
yet
awake
or
that
like
himself
he
had
no
appetite
for
breakfast
he
smiled
ironically
as
the
idea
struck
him
but
it
was
a
smile
that
stiffened
rather
than
relaxed
his
lips
then
he
drew
out
the
duplicate
key
he
always
carried
and
inserting
it
quietly
opened
the
door
a
close
unpleasant
smell
greeted
him
as
he
entered
the
small
passage
that
divided
the
bed
and
sitting
rooms
a
smell
of
whiskey
mingling
with
the
odor
of
stale
smoke
with
a
quick
gesture
he
pushed
open
the
bedroom
door
then
on
the
threshold
he
paused
a
look
of
contempt
and
repulsion
passing
over
his
face
in
his
first
glance
he
scarcely
grasped
the
details
of
the
scene
for
the
curtains
kept
the
light
dim
but
as
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
obscurity
he
gathered
their
significance
the
room
had
a
sleepless
jaded
air
the
room
that
under
his
own
occupation
had
shown
a
rigid
almost
monastic
severity
the
plain
was
littered
with
cigarette
ends
and
marked
with
black
and
tawny
patches
where
the
tobacco
had
been
left
to
burn
itself
out
on
one
corner
of
the
table
a
carafe
of
water
and
a
rested
one
against
the
other
as
if
for
support
and
at
the
other
end
an
overturned
tumbler
lay
in
a
pool
of
liquid
the
whole
effect
was
sickly
and
nauseating
his
glance
turned
involuntarily
to
the
bed
and
there
halted
on
the
hard
narrow
mattress
from
which
the
sheets
and
blankets
had
fallen
in
a
disordered
heap
lay
chilcote
he
was
fully
dressed
in
a
shabby
tweed
suit
of
loder
his
collar
was
open
his
lip
and
chin
unshaven
one
hand
was
limply
grasping
the
pillow
while
the
other
hung
out
over
the
side
of
the
bed
his
face
pale
almost
earthy
in
hue
might
have
been
a
mask
save
for
the
slight
convulsive
spasms
that
crossed
it
from
time
to
time
and
corresponded
with
the
faint
shivering
starts
that
passed
at
intervals
over
his
whole
body
to
complete
his
repellent
appearance
a
lock
of
hair
had
fallen
loose
and
lay
black
and
damp
across
his
forehead
loder
stood
for
a
space
shocked
and
spellbound
by
the
sight
even
in
the
ghastly
disarray
the
likeness
the
extraordinary
sinister
likeness
that
had
become
the
pivot
upon
which
he
himself
revolved
struck
him
like
a
blow
the
man
who
lay
there
was
to
him
by
some
subtle
inexplicable
tie
of
similarity
as
the
idea
touched
him
he
turned
aside
and
stepped
quickly
to
the
there
with
unnecessary
energy
he
flung
back
the
curtains
and
threw
the
window
wide
then
again
he
turned
towards
the
bed
he
had
one
dominant
impulse
to
waken
chilcote
to
be
free
of
the
repulsive
inert
presence
that
chilled
him
with
so
personal
a
horror
leaning
over
the
bed
he
caught
the
shoulder
nearest
to
him
and
shook
it
it
was
not
the
moment
for
niceties
and
his
gesture
was
rough
at
his
first
touch
chilcote
made
no
response
his
brain
dulled
by
indulgence
in
his
vice
had
become
a
laggard
in
conveying
sensations
but
at
last
as
the
pressure
on
his
shoulder
increased
his
nervous
system
seemed
suddenly
to
jar
into
consciousness
a
long
shudder
shook
him
he
half
lifted
himself
and
then
dropped
back
upon
the
pillow
oh
he
exclaimed
in
a
trembling
breath
oh
the
sound
seemed
drawn
from
him
by
compulsion
its
uncanny
tone
chilled
loder
anew
wake
up
man
he
said
suddenly
wake
up
it
i
again
the
other
shuddered
then
he
turned
quickly
and
nervously
loder
he
said
doubtfully
loder
then
his
face
changed
good
god
he
exclaimed
what
a
relief
the
words
were
so
intense
so
spontaneous
and
unexpected
that
loder
took
a
step
back
chilcote
laughed
discordantly
and
lifted
a
shaky
hand
to
protect
his
eyes
from
the
light
it
it
all
right
loder
it
all
right
it
only
that
i
that
i
had
a
beastly
dream
but
for
heaven
sake
shut
that
window
he
shivered
involuntarily
and
pushed
the
lock
of
damp
hair
from
his
forehead
with
a
weak
touch
of
his
old
irritability
in
silence
loder
moved
back
to
the
window
and
shut
it
he
was
affected
more
than
he
would
own
even
to
himself
by
the
obvious
change
in
chilcote
he
had
seen
him
moody
restless
nervously
excited
but
never
before
had
he
seen
him
entirely
demoralized
with
a
dull
feeling
of
impotence
and
disgust
he
stood
by
the
closed
window
looking
unseeingly
at
the
roofs
of
the
opposite
houses
but
chilcote
had
followed
his
movements
restlessly
and
now
as
he
watched
him
a
flicker
of
excitement
crossed
his
face
god
loder
he
said
again
was
a
relief
to
see
you
i
dreamed
i
was
in
hell
a
horrible
hell
worse
than
the
one
they
preach
he
laughed
to
reassure
himself
but
his
voice
shook
pitiably
loder
who
had
come
to
fight
stood
silent
and
inert
it
was
horrible
beastly
chilcote
went
on
there
was
no
fire
and
brimstone
but
there
was
something
worse
it
was
a
great
ironic
scheme
of
punishment
by
which
every
man
was
chained
to
his
own
vice
by
which
the
thing
he
had
gone
to
pieces
over
instead
of
being
denied
him
was
made
compulsory
you
ca
imagine
he
shivered
nervously
and
his
voice
rose
fancy
being
satiated
beyond
the
limit
of
satiety
being
driven
and
dogged
by
the
thing
you
had
run
after
all
your
life
he
paused
excitedly
and
in
the
pause
loder
found
resolution
he
shut
his
ears
to
the
panic
in
chilcote
voice
he
closed
his
consciousness
to
the
sight
of
his
shaken
face
with
a
surge
of
determination
he
rallied
his
theories
after
all
he
had
himself
and
his
own
interests
to
claim
his
thought
at
the
moment
chilcote
was
a
wreck
with
no
desire
towards
rehabilitation
but
there
was
no
guarantee
that
in
an
hour
or
two
he
might
not
have
regained
control
over
himself
and
with
it
the
inclination
that
had
prompted
his
letter
of
the
day
before
no
he
had
himself
to
look
to
the
survival
of
the
fittest
was
the
true
the
only
principle
chilcote
had
had
intellect
education
opportunity
and
chilcote
had
deliberately
cast
them
aside
fortifying
himself
in
the
knowledge
he
turned
from
the
window
and
moved
slowly
back
to
the
bed
look
here
he
began
you
wrote
for
me
last
night
his
voice
was
hard
he
had
come
to
fight
chilcote
glanced
up
quickly
his
mouth
was
drawn
and
there
was
anew
anxiety
in
his
eyes
loder
he
exclaimed
quickly
loder
come
here
come
nearer
reluctantly
loder
obeyed
stepping
closer
to
the
side
of
the
bed
he
bent
down
the
other
put
up
his
hand
and
caught
his
arm
his
fingers
trembled
and
jerked
i
say
loder
he
said
suddenly
i
i
had
such
a
beastly
night
my
nerves
you
know
with
a
quick
involuntary
disgust
loder
drew
back
do
you
think
we
might
shove
that
aside
he
asked
but
chilcote
gaze
had
wandered
from
his
face
and
strayed
to
the
there
it
moved
feverishly
from
one
object
to
another
loder
he
exclaimed
do
you
see
can
you
see
if
there
a
tube
of
tabloids
on
the
or
on
the
he
lifted
himself
nervously
on
his
elbow
and
his
eyes
wandered
uneasily
about
the
room
i
i
had
a
beastly
night
my
nerves
are
horribly
jarred
and
i
thought
i
think
he
stopped
with
his
increasing
consciousness
his
nervous
collapse
became
more
marked
at
the
first
moment
of
waking
the
relief
of
an
unexpected
presence
had
surmounted
everything
else
but
now
as
one
by
one
his
faculties
stirred
his
wretched
condition
became
patent
with
a
new
sense
of
perturbation
loder
made
his
next
attack
chilcote
he
began
sternly
but
again
chilcote
caught
his
arm
plucking
at
the
where
is
it
he
said
where
is
the
tube
of
tabloids
the
sedative
i
obliged
to
take
something
when
my
nerves
go
wrong
in
his
weakness
and
nervous
tremor
he
forgot
that
loder
was
the
sharer
of
his
secret
even
in
his
extremity
his
fear
of
detection
clung
to
him
limply
the
lies
that
had
become
second
nature
slipped
from
him
without
effort
then
suddenly
a
fresh
panic
seized
him
his
fingers
tightened
spasmodically
his
eyes
ceased
to
rove
about
the
room
and
settled
on
his
face
can
you
see
it
loder
he
cried
i
ca
the
light
in
my
eyes
can
you
see
it
can
you
see
the
tube
he
lifted
himself
higher
an
agony
of
apprehension
in
his
face
loder
pushed
him
back
upon
the
pillow
he
was
striving
hard
to
keep
his
own
mind
cool
to
steer
his
own
course
straight
through
the
chaos
that
confronted
him
chilcote
he
began
once
more
you
sent
for
me
last
night
and
i
came
the
first
thing
this
morning
to
tell
you
but
there
he
stopped
with
an
excitement
that
lent
him
strength
chilcote
pushed
aside
his
hands
god
he
said
suddenly
suppose
was
lost
suppose
was
gone
the
imaginary
possibility
gripped
him
he
sat
up
his
face
livid
drops
of
perspiration
showing
on
his
forehead
his
whole
shattered
system
trembling
before
his
thought
at
the
sight
loder
set
his
lips
the
tube
is
on
the
he
said
in
a
cold
abrupt
voice
a
groan
of
relief
fell
from
chilcote
and
the
muscles
of
his
face
relaxed
for
a
moment
he
lay
back
with
closed
eyes
then
the
desire
that
tortured
him
stirred
afresh
he
lifted
his
eyelids
and
looked
at
his
companion
hand
it
to
me
he
said
quickly
give
it
to
me
give
it
to
me
loder
quick
as
you
can
there
a
glass
on
the
table
and
some
whiskey
and
water
the
tabloids
dissolve
you
know
in
his
new
excitement
he
held
out
his
hand
but
loder
stayed
motionless
he
had
come
to
fight
to
demand
to
plead
if
need
be
for
the
one
hour
for
which
he
had
lived
the
hour
that
was
to
satisfy
all
labor
all
endeavor
all
ambition
with
dogged
persistence
he
made
one
more
essay
chilcote
you
wrote
last
night
to
recall
me
once
again
he
paused
checked
by
a
new
interruption
sitting
up
again
chilcote
struck
out
suddenly
with
his
left
hand
in
a
rush
of
his
old
irritability
damn
you
he
cried
suddenly
what
are
you
talking
about
look
at
me
get
me
the
stuff
i
tell
you
it
in
his
excitement
his
breath
failed
and
he
coughed
at
the
effort
his
whole
frame
was
shaken
loder
walked
to
the
then
back
to
the
bed
a
deep
agitation
was
at
work
in
his
mind
again
chilcote
lips
parted
loder
he
said
faintly
loder
i
must
i
must
have
it
it
once
more
he
attempted
to
lift
himself
but
the
effort
was
futile
again
loder
turned
away
loder
for
god
sake
with
a
fierce
gesture
the
other
turned
on
him
good
heavens
man
he
began
then
unaccountably
his
voice
changed
the
suggestion
that
had
been
hovering
in
his
mind
took
sudden
and
definite
shape
all
right
he
said
in
a
lower
voice
all
right
stay
as
you
he
crossed
to
where
the
empty
tumbler
stood
and
hastily
mixed
the
whiskey
and
water
then
crossing
to
the
where
lay
the
small
glass
tube
containing
the
tightly
packed
tabloids
he
paused
and
glanced
once
more
towards
the
bed
how
many
he
said
laconically
chilcote
lifted
his
head
his
face
was
pitiably
drawn
but
the
feverish
brightness
in
his
eyes
had
increased
five
he
said
sharply
five
do
you
hear
loder
five
involuntarily
loder
lowered
the
hand
that
held
the
tube
from
previous
confidences
of
chilcote
he
knew
the
amount
of
morphia
contained
in
each
tabloid
and
realized
that
five
tabloids
if
not
an
absolutely
dangerous
was
at
least
an
excessive
dose
even
for
one
accustomed
to
the
drug
for
a
moment
his
resolution
failed
then
the
of
his
nature
the
unconscious
fundamental
egotism
on
which
his
character
was
based
asserted
itself
beyond
denial
it
might
be
reprehensible
it
might
even
be
criminal
to
accede
to
such
a
request
made
by
a
man
in
such
a
condition
of
body
and
mind
yet
the
laws
of
the
universe
demanded
prompted
every
human
mind
to
desire
to
grasp
and
to
hold
with
a
perception
swifter
than
any
he
had
experienced
he
realized
the
certain
respite
to
be
gained
by
yielding
to
his
impulse
he
looked
at
chilcote
with
his
haggard
anxious
expression
his
eager
restless
eyes
and
a
vision
of
himself
followed
sharp
upon
his
glance
a
vision
of
the
untiring
labor
of
the
past
ten
days
of
the
slowly
kindling
ambition
of
the
supremacy
all
but
gained
then
as
the
picture
completed
itself
he
lifted
his
hand
with
an
abrupt
movement
and
dropped
the
five
tabloids
one
after
another
into
the
glass
xxv
having
taken
a
definite
step
in
any
direction
it
was
not
in
loder
nature
to
wish
it
retraced
his
face
was
set
but
set
with
determination
when
he
closed
the
outer
door
of
his
own
rooms
and
passed
quietly
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
silent
court
the
thought
of
chilcote
his
pitiable
condition
his
sordid
environments
were
things
that
required
a
firm
will
to
drive
into
the
background
of
the
imagination
but
a
whole
inferno
of
such
visions
would
not
have
daunted
loder
on
that
morning
as
unobserved
by
any
eyes
he
left
the
little
with
its
grass
its
trees
its
pavement
all
so
distastefully
familiar
and
passed
down
the
strand
towards
life
and
action
as
he
walked
his
steps
increased
in
speed
and
vigor
now
for
the
first
time
he
fully
appreciated
the
great
mental
strain
that
he
had
undergone
in
the
past
ten
days
the
unnatural
tension
the
suppressed
but
perpetual
sense
of
impending
recall
the
consequently
high
pressure
at
which
work
and
even
existence
had
been
carried
on
and
as
he
hurried
forward
the
natural
reaction
to
this
state
of
things
came
upon
him
in
a
flood
of
security
and
confidence
a
strong
realization
of
the
temporary
respite
and
freedom
for
which
no
price
would
have
seemed
too
high
the
moment
for
which
he
had
unconsciously
lived
ever
since
chilcote
first
memorable
proposition
was
within
reach
at
last
safeguarded
by
his
own
action
the
walk
from
clifford
inn
to
grosvenor
square
was
long
enough
to
dispel
any
excitement
that
his
interview
had
aroused
and
long
before
the
house
came
into
view
he
felt
sufficiently
braced
mentally
and
physically
to
seek
eve
in
the
where
he
instinctively
felt
she
would
still
be
waiting
for
him
thus
he
encountered
and
overpassed
the
obstacle
that
had
so
nearly
threatened
ruin
and
with
the
singleness
of
purpose
that
always
distinguished
him
he
was
able
once
having
passed
it
to
dismiss
it
altogether
from
his
mind
from
the
moment
of
his
return
to
house
no
misgiving
as
to
his
own
action
no
shadow
of
doubt
rose
to
trouble
his
mind
his
feelings
on
the
matter
were
quite
simple
he
had
inordinately
desired
a
certain
opportunity
one
factor
had
arisen
to
debar
that
opportunity
and
he
claiming
the
right
of
strength
had
set
the
barrier
aside
in
the
simplicity
of
the
reasoning
lay
its
power
to
convince
and
were
a
tonic
needed
to
brace
him
for
his
task
he
was
provided
with
one
in
the
masterful
sense
of
a
difficulty
set
at
nought
for
the
man
who
has
fought
and
conquered
one
obstacle
feels
strong
to
vanquish
a
score
it
was
on
this
day
at
the
reassembling
of
parliament
that
great
blow
was
to
be
struck
in
the
ten
days
since
the
affair
of
the
caravans
had
been
reported
from
persia
public
feeling
had
run
high
and
it
was
upon
the
pivot
of
this
incident
that
loder
attack
was
to
turn
for
as
lakely
was
fond
of
remarking
in
the
scales
of
public
opinion
one
dead
englishman
has
more
weight
than
the
whole
eastern
question
it
had
been
arranged
that
following
the
customary
procedure
loder
was
to
rise
after
questions
at
the
morning
sitting
and
ask
leave
to
move
the
adjournment
of
the
house
on
a
definite
matter
of
urgent
public
importance
upon
which
leave
having
been
granted
by
the
rising
of
forty
members
in
his
support
the
way
was
to
lie
open
for
his
definite
attack
at
the
evening
sitting
and
it
was
with
a
mind
attuned
to
this
plan
of
action
that
he
retired
to
the
study
immediately
he
had
breakfasted
and
settled
to
a
final
revision
of
his
speech
before
an
early
party
conference
should
compel
him
to
leave
the
house
but
here
again
circumstances
were
destined
to
change
his
programme
scarcely
had
he
sorted
his
notes
and
drawn
his
chair
to
chilcote
desk
than
renwick
entered
the
room
with
the
same
air
of
important
haste
that
he
had
shown
on
a
previous
occasion
a
letter
from
fraide
sir
but
there
no
answer
he
said
with
unusual
brevity
loder
waited
till
he
had
left
the
room
then
he
tore
the
letter
open
he
read
my
dear
chilcote
lakely
is
the
recipient
of
special
and
very
vital
news
from
meshed
unofficial
but
none
the
less
alarming
acts
of
russian
aggression
towards
british
traders
are
reported
to
be
rapidly
increasing
and
it
is
stated
that
the
authority
of
the
consulate
is
treated
with
contempt
pending
a
possible
confirmation
of
this
i
would
suggest
that
you
keep
an
open
mind
on
the
subject
of
speech
by
adopting
an
anticipatory
even
an
unprepared
attitude
you
may
find
your
hand
materially
strengthened
i
shall
put
my
opinions
before
you
more
explicitly
when
we
meet
yours
faithfully
herbert
the
letter
worded
with
fraide
usual
restraint
made
a
strong
impression
on
its
recipient
the
thought
that
his
speech
might
not
only
express
opinions
already
tacitly
held
but
voice
a
situation
of
intense
and
national
importance
struck
him
with
full
force
for
many
minutes
after
he
had
grasped
the
meaning
of
fraide
message
he
sat
neglectful
of
his
notes
his
elbows
resting
on
the
desk
his
face
between
his
hands
stirred
by
the
suggestion
that
here
might
lie
a
greater
opportunity
than
any
he
had
anticipated
still
moved
by
this
new
suggestion
he
attended
the
party
conclave
that
fraide
had
convened
and
afterwards
lunched
with
and
accompanied
his
leader
to
the
house
they
spoke
very
little
as
they
drove
to
westminster
for
each
was
engrossed
by
his
own
thoughts
only
once
did
fraide
allude
to
the
incident
that
was
paramount
in
both
their
minds
then
turning
to
loder
with
a
smile
of
encouragement
he
had
laid
his
fingers
for
an
instant
on
his
arm
chilcote
he
had
said
when
the
time
comes
remember
you
have
all
my
looking
back
upon
that
day
loder
often
wondered
at
the
calmness
with
which
he
bore
the
uncertainty
to
sit
apparently
unmoved
and
wait
without
emotion
for
news
that
might
change
the
whole
tenor
of
action
would
have
tried
the
stoicism
of
the
most
experienced
to
the
novice
it
was
wellnigh
unendurable
and
it
was
under
these
conditions
and
fighting
against
these
odds
that
he
sat
through
the
long
afternoon
in
chilcote
place
obeying
the
dictates
of
his
chief
but
if
the
day
was
fraught
with
difficulties
for
him
it
was
fraught
with
dulness
and
disappointment
for
others
for
the
undercurrent
of
interest
that
had
stirred
at
the
easter
adjournment
and
risen
with
added
force
on
this
first
day
of
the
new
session
was
gradually
but
surely
threatened
with
extinction
as
hour
after
hour
passed
bringing
no
suggestion
of
the
battle
that
had
on
every
side
been
tacitly
expected
slowly
and
unmistakably
speculation
and
dissatisfaction
crept
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
as
moment
succeeded
moment
and
the
opposition
made
no
sign
was
fraide
shirking
the
attack
or
was
he
playing
a
waiting
game
again
and
again
the
question
arose
filling
the
air
with
a
passing
flicker
of
interest
but
each
time
it
sprang
up
only
to
die
down
again
as
the
ordinary
business
of
the
day
dragged
itself
out
gradually
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
daylight
began
to
fade
loder
sitting
rigidly
in
chilcote
place
watched
with
suppressed
inquiry
the
faces
of
the
men
who
entered
through
the
constantly
swinging
doors
but
not
one
face
so
eagerly
scanned
carried
the
message
for
which
he
waited
monotonously
and
mechanically
the
time
passed
the
government
adopting
a
neutral
attitude
carefully
skirted
all
dangerous
subjects
while
the
opposition
acting
under
fraide
suggestion
assisted
rather
than
hindered
the
programme
of
postponement
for
the
moment
the
eagerly
anticipated
reassembling
threatened
dismal
failure
and
it
was
with
a
universal
movement
of
weariness
and
relief
that
at
last
the
house
rose
to
dine
but
there
are
no
possibilities
so
elastic
as
those
of
politics
at
seven
the
house
rose
in
a
spirit
of
boredom
and
disappointment
and
at
eight
the
lobbies
the
the
entire
space
of
the
vast
building
was
stirred
into
activity
by
the
arrival
of
a
single
telegraphic
message
the
new
development
for
which
fraide
had
waited
came
indeed
but
it
came
with
a
force
he
had
little
anticipated
with
a
thrill
of
awe
and
consternation
men
heard
and
repeated
the
astounding
news
that
while
personally
exercising
his
authority
on
behalf
of
british
traders
sir
william
at
meshed
had
been
fired
at
by
a
russian
officer
and
instantly
killed
the
interval
immediately
following
the
receipt
of
this
news
was
too
confused
for
detailed
remembrance
two
ideas
made
themselves
slowly
felt
a
deep
horror
that
such
an
event
could
obtrude
itself
upon
our
high
civilization
and
a
strong
personal
dismay
that
so
honored
distinguished
and
esteemed
a
representative
as
sir
william
could
have
been
allowed
to
meet
death
in
so
terrible
a
manner
it
was
in
the
consciousness
of
this
feeling
the
consciousness
that
in
his
own
person
he
might
voice
not
only
the
feelings
of
his
party
but
those
of
the
whole
country
that
loder
rose
an
hour
later
to
make
his
attack
he
stood
silent
for
a
moment
as
he
had
done
on
an
earlier
occasion
but
this
time
his
motive
was
different
roused
beyond
any
feeling
of
he
waited
as
by
right
for
the
full
attention
of
the
house
then
quietly
but
with
firmness
he
moved
the
motion
for
adjournment
like
a
match
to
a
train
of
powder
the
words
set
flame
to
the
excitement
that
had
smouldered
for
weeks
and
in
an
atmosphere
of
stirring
activity
a
scene
of
such
tense
and
vital
concentration
as
the
house
has
rarely
witnessed
he
found
inspiration
for
his
great
achievement
to
give
loder
speech
in
mere
words
would
be
little
short
of
futile
the
gift
of
oratory
is
too
illusive
too
much
a
matter
of
eye
and
voice
and
individuality
to
allow
of
cold
reproduction
to
those
who
heard
him
speak
on
that
night
of
april
the
speech
will
require
no
recalling
and
to
those
who
did
not
hear
him
there
would
be
no
substitute
in
bare
reproduction
in
the
moment
of
action
it
mattered
nothing
to
him
that
his
previous
preparations
were
to
a
great
extent
rendered
useless
by
this
news
that
had
come
with
such
paralyzing
effect
in
the
sweeping
consciousness
of
his
own
ability
he
found
added
joy
in
the
freedom
it
opened
up
he
ceased
to
consider
that
by
fate
he
was
a
conservative
bound
by
traditional
conventionalities
in
that
great
moment
he
knew
himself
sufficiently
a
man
to
exercise
whatever
individuality
instinct
prompted
he
forgot
the
didactic
methods
by
which
he
had
proposed
to
show
knowledge
of
his
subject
both
as
a
past
and
a
future
factor
in
european
politics
with
his
own
strong
appreciation
of
present
things
he
saw
and
grasped
the
vast
present
interest
lying
beneath
his
hand
for
fifty
minutes
he
held
the
interest
of
the
house
speaking
insistently
fearlessly
commandingly
on
the
immediate
need
of
action
he
unhesitatingly
pointed
out
that
the
news
which
had
just
reached
england
was
not
so
much
an
appalling
fact
as
a
sinister
warning
to
those
in
whose
keeping
lay
the
safety
of
the
country
interests
lastly
with
a
fine
touch
of
eloquence
he
paid
tribute
to
the
steadfast
fidelity
of
such
men
as
sir
william
who
whatever
political
complications
arise
at
home
pursue
their
duty
unswervingly
on
the
outposts
of
the
empire
at
his
last
words
there
was
silence
the
silence
that
marks
a
genuine
effect
then
all
at
once
with
vehement
impressive
force
the
storm
of
enthusiasm
broke
its
bounds
it
was
one
of
those
stupendous
bursts
of
feeling
that
no
etiquette
no
decorum
is
powerful
enough
to
quell
as
he
resumed
his
seat
very
pale
but
exalted
as
men
are
exalted
only
once
or
twice
in
a
lifetime
it
rose
about
him
clamorous
spontaneous
undeniable
near
at
hand
were
the
faces
of
his
party
excited
and
triumphant
across
the
house
were
the
faces
of
sefborough
and
his
ministry
uncomfortable
and
disturbed
the
tumult
swelled
then
fell
away
and
in
the
partial
lull
that
followed
fraide
leaned
over
the
back
of
his
seat
his
quiet
dignified
expression
was
unaltered
but
his
eyes
were
intensely
bright
chilcote
he
whispered
i
do
congratulate
you
or
myself
i
congratulate
the
country
on
possessing
a
great
man
the
remaining
features
of
the
debate
followed
quickly
one
upon
the
other
the
electric
atmosphere
of
the
house
possessed
a
strong
incentive
power
immediately
loder
ovation
had
subsided
the
for
foreign
affairs
rose
and
in
a
careful
and
reply
defended
the
attitude
of
the
government
next
came
fraide
who
in
one
of
his
rare
and
polished
speeches
touched
with
much
feeling
upon
his
personal
grief
at
the
news
reported
from
persia
and
made
emphatic
indorsement
of
loder
words
following
fraide
came
one
or
two
dissentient
liberals
and
then
sefborough
himself
closed
the
debate
his
speech
was
masterly
and
fluent
but
though
any
disquietude
he
may
have
felt
was
well
disguised
under
a
tone
of
reassuring
ease
the
attempt
to
rehabilitate
his
position
already
weakened
in
more
than
one
direction
was
a
task
beyond
his
strength
amid
extraordinary
excitement
the
division
followed
and
with
it
a
government
defeat
it
was
not
until
half
an
hour
after
the
votes
had
been
taken
that
loder
freed
at
last
from
persistent
congratulations
found
opportunity
to
look
for
eve
in
accordance
with
a
promise
made
that
morning
he
was
to
find
her
waiting
outside
the
ladies
gallery
at
the
close
of
the
debate
disengaging
himself
from
the
group
of
men
who
had
surrounded
and
followed
him
down
the
lobby
he
discarded
the
lift
and
ran
up
the
narrow
staircase
reaching
the
landing
he
went
forward
hurriedly
then
with
a
certain
abrupt
movement
he
paused
in
the
doorway
leading
to
the
gallery
eve
was
waiting
for
him
the
place
was
not
brightly
lighted
and
she
was
standing
in
the
shadow
but
it
needed
only
a
glance
to
assure
his
recognition
he
could
almost
have
seen
in
the
dark
that
night
so
vivid
were
his
perceptions
he
took
a
step
towards
her
then
again
he
stopped
in
a
second
glance
he
realized
that
her
eyes
were
bright
with
tears
and
it
was
with
the
strangest
sensation
he
had
ever
experienced
that
the
knowledge
flashed
upon
him
here
also
he
had
struck
the
same
note
the
note
of
supremacy
it
had
rung
out
full
and
clear
as
he
stood
in
chilcote
place
dominating
the
house
it
had
besieged
him
clamorously
as
he
passed
along
the
lobbies
amid
a
sea
of
friendly
hands
and
voices
now
in
the
quiet
of
the
deserted
gallery
it
came
home
to
him
with
deeper
meaning
from
the
eyes
of
chilcote
wife
without
a
thought
he
put
out
his
hands
and
caught
hers
i
could
get
away
he
said
i
afraid
i
very
with
a
smile
that
scattered
her
tears
eve
looked
up
are
you
she
said
laughing
a
little
i
do
know
what
the
time
is
i
scarcely
know
whether
it
night
or
still
holding
one
of
her
hands
he
drew
her
down
the
stairs
but
as
they
reached
the
last
step
she
released
her
fingers
in
the
carriage
she
said
with
another
little
laugh
of
nervous
happiness
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
they
were
surrounded
men
whose
faces
loder
barely
knew
crowded
about
him
the
intoxication
of
excitement
was
still
in
the
air
the
instinct
that
a
new
force
had
made
itself
felt
a
new
epoch
been
entered
upon
stirred
prophetically
in
every
mind
passing
through
the
enthusiastic
concourse
of
men
they
came
unexpectedly
upon
fraide
and
lady
sarah
surrounded
by
a
group
of
friends
the
old
statesman
came
forward
instantly
and
taking
arm
walked
with
him
to
chilcote
waiting
brougham
he
said
little
as
they
slowly
made
their
way
to
the
carriage
but
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
was
tense
and
an
unwonted
color
showed
in
his
face
when
eve
and
loder
had
taken
their
seats
he
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
curb
they
were
alone
for
the
moment
and
leaning
close
to
the
carriage
he
put
his
hand
through
the
open
window
in
silence
he
took
eve
fingers
and
held
them
in
a
long
affectionate
pressure
then
he
released
them
and
took
loder
hand
chilcote
he
said
you
have
proved
yourself
worthy
of
her
he
turned
quickly
and
rejoined
his
waiting
friends
in
another
second
the
horses
had
wheeled
round
and
eve
and
loder
were
carried
swiftly
forward
into
the
darkness
in
the
great
moments
of
man
life
woman
comes
before
and
after
some
shadow
of
this
truth
was
in
eve
mind
as
she
lay
back
in
her
seat
with
closed
eyes
and
parted
lips
it
seemed
that
life
came
to
her
now
for
the
first
time
came
in
the
glad
proud
satisfying
tide
of
things
accomplished
this
was
her
hour
and
the
recognition
of
it
brought
the
blood
to
her
face
in
a
sudden
happy
rush
there
had
been
no
need
to
precipitate
its
coming
it
had
been
ordained
from
the
first
whether
she
desired
it
or
no
whether
she
strove
to
draw
it
nearer
or
strove
to
ward
it
off
its
coming
had
been
inevitable
she
opened
her
eyes
suddenly
and
looked
out
into
the
darkness
the
darkness
throbbing
with
multitudes
of
lives
all
awaiting
all
desiring
fulfilment
she
was
no
longer
lonely
no
longer
aloof
she
was
kin
with
all
this
pitiful
admirable
sinning
loving
humanity
again
tears
of
pride
and
happiness
filled
her
eyes
then
suddenly
the
thing
she
had
waited
for
came
to
pass
loder
leaned
close
to
her
she
was
conscious
of
his
nearer
presence
of
his
strong
masterful
personality
with
a
thrill
that
caught
her
breath
she
felt
his
arm
about
her
shoulder
and
heard
the
sound
of
his
voice
eve
he
said
i
love
you
do
you
understand
i
love
and
drawing
her
close
to
him
he
bent
and
kissed
her
with
loder
to
do
was
to
do
fully
when
he
gave
he
gave
generously
when
he
swept
aside
a
barrier
he
left
no
stone
standing
he
had
been
slow
to
recognize
his
capacities
slower
still
to
recognize
his
feelings
but
now
that
the
knowledge
came
he
received
it
openly
in
this
matter
of
newly
comprehended
love
he
gave
no
thought
to
either
past
or
future
that
they
loved
and
were
alone
was
all
he
knew
or
questioned
she
was
as
much
eve
the
one
woman
as
though
they
were
together
in
the
primeval
garden
and
in
that
spirit
he
claimed
her
he
neither
spoke
nor
behaved
extravagantly
in
that
great
moment
of
comprehension
he
acted
quietly
with
the
completeness
of
purpose
that
he
gave
to
everything
he
had
found
a
new
capacity
within
himself
and
he
was
strong
enough
to
dread
no
weakness
in
displaying
it
holding
her
close
to
him
he
repeated
his
declaration
again
and
again
as
though
repetition
ratified
it
he
found
no
need
to
question
her
feeling
for
him
he
had
divined
it
in
a
flash
of
inspiration
as
she
stood
waiting
in
the
doorway
of
the
gallery
but
his
own
surrender
was
a
different
matter
as
the
carriage
passed
round
the
corner
of
whitehall
and
dipped
into
the
traffic
of
piccadilly
he
bent
down
again
until
her
soft
hair
brushed
his
face
and
the
warm
personal
contact
the
slight
fresh
smell
of
violets
so
suggestive
of
her
presence
stirred
him
afresh
eve
he
said
vehemently
do
you
understand
do
you
know
that
i
have
loved
you
always
from
the
very
first
as
he
said
it
he
bent
still
nearer
kissing
her
lips
her
forehead
her
hair
at
the
same
moment
the
horses
slackened
speed
and
then
stopped
arrested
by
one
of
the
temporary
blocks
that
so
often
occur
in
the
traffic
of
piccadilly
circus
loder
preoccupied
with
his
own
feelings
scarcely
noticed
the
halt
but
eve
drew
away
from
him
laughing
you
must
she
said
softly
look
the
carriage
had
stopped
beside
one
of
the
small
islands
that
intersect
the
place
a
group
of
pedestrians
were
crowded
upon
it
under
the
light
of
the
electric
lamp
wayfarers
who
like
themselves
were
awaiting
a
passage
loder
took
a
cursory
glance
at
them
then
turned
back
to
eve
what
are
they
after
all
but
men
and
women
he
said
understand
every
one
of
he
laughed
in
his
turn
nevertheless
he
withdrew
his
arm
her
feminine
thought
for
conventionalities
appealed
to
him
it
was
an
acknowledgment
of
dependency
for
a
while
they
sat
silent
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
flickering
through
the
glass
of
the
window
the
hum
of
voices
and
traffic
coming
to
them
in
a
continuous
rise
and
fall
of
sound
at
first
the
position
was
interesting
but
as
the
seconds
followed
each
other
it
gradually
became
irksome
loder
watching
the
varying
expressions
of
eve
face
grew
impatient
of
the
delay
grew
suddenly
eager
to
be
alone
again
in
the
fragrant
darkness
impelled
by
the
desire
he
leaned
forward
and
opened
the
window
let
find
the
meaning
of
this
he
said
is
there
nobody
to
regulate
the
traffic
as
he
spoke
he
half
rose
and
leaned
out
of
the
window
there
was
a
touch
of
imperious
annoyance
in
his
manner
fresh
from
the
realization
of
power
there
was
something
irksome
in
this
commonplace
check
to
his
desires
is
it
possible
to
get
out
of
this
eve
heard
him
call
to
the
coachman
then
she
heard
no
more
he
had
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
with
the
intention
of
looking
onward
towards
the
cause
of
the
delay
instead
by
that
magnetic
attraction
that
undoubtedly
exists
he
looked
directly
in
front
of
him
at
the
group
of
people
waiting
on
the
little
island
at
one
man
who
leaned
against
the
in
an
attitude
of
apathy
a
man
with
a
pallid
unshaven
face
and
lustreless
eyes
who
wore
a
cap
drawn
low
over
his
forehead
he
looked
at
this
man
and
the
man
saw
and
returned
his
glance
for
a
space
that
seemed
interminable
they
held
each
other
eyes
then
very
slowly
loder
drew
back
into
the
carriage
as
he
dropped
into
his
seat
eve
glanced
at
him
anxiously
john
she
said
has
anything
happened
you
look
he
turned
to
her
and
tried
to
smile
it
nothing
he
said
nothing
to
worry
he
spoke
quickly
but
his
voice
had
suddenly
become
flat
all
the
command
all
the
domination
had
dropped
away
from
it
eve
bent
close
to
him
her
face
lighting
up
with
anxious
tenderness
it
was
the
excitement
she
said
the
strain
of
he
looked
at
her
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
press
the
fingers
that
clasped
his
own
yes
he
said
slowly
yes
it
was
the
excitement
of
and
the
xxvi
the
next
morning
at
eight
and
again
without
breakfast
loder
covered
the
distance
between
grosvenor
square
and
clifford
inn
he
left
chilcote
house
hastily
with
a
haste
that
only
an
urgent
motive
could
have
driven
him
to
adopt
his
steps
were
quick
and
uneven
as
he
traversed
the
intervening
streets
his
shoulders
lacked
their
decisive
pose
and
his
pale
face
was
marked
with
shadows
beneath
the
eyes
shadows
that
bore
witness
to
the
sleepless
night
spent
in
pacing
chilcote
vast
and
lonely
room
by
the
curious
effect
of
circumstances
the
likeness
between
the
two
men
had
never
been
more
significantly
marked
than
on
that
morning
of
april
when
loder
walked
along
the
pavements
crowded
with
early
workers
and
brisk
with
insistent
already
alive
to
the
value
of
last
night
political
crisis
the
irony
of
this
last
element
in
the
day
concerns
came
to
him
fully
when
one
newsboy
more
energetic
than
his
fellows
thrust
a
paper
in
front
of
him
sensation
in
the
sir
speech
by
chilcote
government
defeat
for
a
moment
loder
stopped
and
his
face
reddened
the
tide
of
emotions
still
ran
strong
his
hand
went
instinctively
to
his
pocket
then
his
lips
set
he
shook
his
head
and
walked
on
with
the
same
hard
expression
about
his
mouth
he
turned
into
inn
passed
through
his
own
doorway
and
mounted
the
stairs
this
time
there
was
no
on
the
threshold
of
his
rooms
and
the
door
yielded
to
his
pressure
without
the
need
of
a
key
with
a
strange
sensation
of
reluctance
he
walked
into
the
narrow
passage
and
paused
uncertain
which
room
to
enter
first
as
he
stood
hesitating
a
voice
from
the
settled
the
question
who
there
it
called
irritably
what
do
you
want
without
further
ceremony
the
intruder
pushed
the
door
open
and
entered
the
room
as
he
did
so
he
drew
a
quick
breath
whether
of
disappointment
or
relief
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
he
had
hoped
for
or
dreaded
it
chilcote
was
conscious
as
loder
entered
he
was
sitting
by
the
cheerless
grate
the
ashes
of
yesterday
fire
showing
charred
and
dreary
where
the
sun
touched
them
his
back
was
to
the
light
and
about
his
shoulders
was
an
old
plaid
rug
behind
him
on
the
table
stood
a
cup
a
teapot
and
the
can
of
milk
farther
off
a
kettle
was
set
to
boil
upon
a
tiny
in
all
strong
situations
we
are
more
or
less
commonplace
first
remark
as
he
glanced
round
the
disordered
room
seemed
strangely
inefficient
where
robins
he
asked
in
a
brusque
voice
his
mind
teemed
with
big
considerations
yet
this
was
his
first
involuntary
question
chilcote
had
started
at
the
entrance
of
his
visitor
now
he
sat
staring
at
him
his
hands
holding
the
arms
of
his
chair
where
robins
loder
asked
again
i
do
know
she
i
we
did
hit
it
off
she
gone
went
he
shivered
and
drew
the
rug
about
him
chilcote
loder
began
sternly
then
he
paused
there
was
something
in
the
other
look
and
attitude
that
arrested
him
a
change
of
expression
passed
over
his
own
face
he
turned
about
with
an
abrupt
gesture
pulled
off
his
coat
and
threw
it
on
a
chair
then
crossing
deliberately
to
the
fireplace
he
began
to
rake
the
ashes
from
the
grate
within
a
few
minutes
he
had
a
fire
crackling
where
the
bed
of
dead
cinders
had
been
and
having
finished
the
task
he
rose
slowly
from
his
knees
wiped
his
hands
and
crossed
to
the
table
on
the
small
the
kettle
had
boiled
and
the
cover
was
lifting
and
falling
with
a
tinkling
sound
blowing
out
the
flame
loder
picked
up
the
teapot
and
with
hands
that
were
evidently
accustomed
to
the
task
set
about
making
the
tea
during
the
whole
operation
he
never
spoke
though
all
the
while
he
was
fully
conscious
of
chilcote
puzzled
gaze
the
tea
ready
he
poured
it
into
the
cup
and
carried
it
across
the
room
drink
this
he
said
laconically
the
fire
will
be
up
chilcote
extended
a
cold
and
shaky
hand
you
see
he
began
but
loder
checked
him
almost
savagely
i
do
as
well
as
though
i
had
followed
you
from
piccadilly
last
night
you
been
hanging
about
god
knows
where
till
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
then
you
come
back
slunk
back
starving
for
your
damned
poison
and
shivering
with
cold
you
settled
the
first
part
of
the
business
but
the
cold
has
still
to
be
reckoned
with
drink
the
tea
i
something
to
say
to
he
mastered
his
vehemence
and
walking
to
the
window
stood
looking
down
into
the
court
his
eyes
were
blank
his
face
hard
his
ears
heard
nothing
but
the
faint
sound
of
chilcote
swallowing
the
click
of
the
cup
against
his
teeth
for
a
time
that
seemed
interminable
he
stood
motionless
then
when
he
judged
the
tea
finished
he
turned
slowly
chilcote
had
drawn
closer
to
the
fire
he
was
obviously
braced
by
the
warmth
and
the
apathy
that
hung
about
him
was
to
some
extent
dispelled
still
moving
slowly
loder
went
towards
him
and
relieving
him
of
the
empty
cup
stood
looking
down
at
him
chilcote
he
said
very
quietly
i
come
to
fell
you
that
the
thing
must
after
he
spoke
there
was
a
prolonged
pause
then
as
if
shaken
with
sudden
consciousness
chilcote
rose
the
rug
dropped
from
one
shoulder
and
hung
down
ludicrously
his
hand
caught
the
back
of
the
chair
for
support
his
unshaven
face
looked
absurd
and
repulsive
in
its
sudden
expression
of
scared
inquiry
loder
involuntarily
turned
away
i
mean
it
he
said
slowly
it
over
we
come
to
the
but
why
chilcote
articulated
blankly
why
why
in
his
confusion
he
could
think
of
no
better
word
because
i
throw
it
up
my
side
of
the
bargain
off
again
chilcote
lips
parted
stammeringly
the
apathy
caused
by
physical
exhaustion
and
his
recently
administered
drug
was
passing
from
him
the
hopelessly
shattered
condition
of
mind
and
body
was
showing
through
it
like
a
skeleton
through
a
thin
covering
of
flesh
but
why
he
said
again
why
still
loder
avoided
the
frightened
surprise
of
his
eyes
because
i
withdraw
he
answered
doggedly
then
suddenly
chilcote
tongue
was
loosened
loder
he
cried
excitedly
you
ca
do
it
god
man
you
ca
do
it
to
reassure
himself
he
laughed
a
painfully
thin
echo
of
his
old
sarcastic
laugh
if
it
a
matter
of
greater
opportunity
he
began
of
more
money
but
loder
turned
upon
him
be
quiet
he
said
so
menacingly
that
the
other
stopped
then
by
an
effort
he
conquered
himself
it
not
a
matter
of
money
chilcote
he
said
quietly
it
a
matter
of
he
brought
the
word
out
with
difficulty
chilcote
glanced
up
necessity
he
repeated
how
why
the
reiteration
roused
loder
because
there
was
a
great
scene
in
the
house
last
night
he
began
hurriedly
because
when
you
go
back
you
find
that
sefborough
has
smashed
up
over
the
assassination
of
sir
william
at
meshed
and
that
you
have
made
your
mark
in
a
big
speech
and
because
abruptly
he
stopped
the
thing
he
had
come
to
say
the
thing
he
had
meant
to
say
would
not
be
said
either
his
tongue
or
his
resolution
failed
him
and
for
the
instant
he
stood
as
silent
and
almost
as
ill
at
ease
as
his
companion
then
all
at
once
inspiration
came
to
him
in
the
suggestion
of
a
wellnigh
forgotten
argument
by
which
he
might
influence
chilcote
and
save
his
own
it
all
over
chilcote
he
said
more
quietly
it
has
run
itself
and
in
a
dozen
sentences
he
sketched
the
story
of
lillian
astrupp
her
past
relations
with
himself
her
present
suspicions
it
was
not
what
he
had
meant
to
say
it
was
not
what
he
had
come
to
say
but
it
served
the
purpose
it
saved
him
humiliation
chilcote
listened
to
the
last
word
then
as
the
other
finished
he
dropped
nervously
back
into
his
chair
good
heavens
man
he
said
why
did
you
tell
me
why
did
you
warn
me
instead
of
filling
my
mind
with
your
political
position
your
political
position
he
laughed
unsteadily
the
long
spells
of
indulgence
that
had
weakened
his
already
maimed
faculties
showed
in
the
laugh
in
the
sudden
breaking
of
his
voice
you
must
do
something
loder
he
added
nervously
checking
his
amusement
you
must
do
something
loder
looked
down
at
him
no
he
said
decisively
it
your
turn
now
it
you
who
got
to
do
chilcote
face
turned
a
shade
grayer
i
ca
he
said
below
his
breath
ca
oh
yes
you
can
we
can
all
do
anything
it
not
too
late
there
just
sufficient
time
chilcote
he
added
suddenly
do
you
see
that
the
thing
has
been
madness
all
along
has
been
like
playing
with
the
most
infernal
explosives
you
may
thank
whatever
you
have
faith
in
that
nobody
has
been
smashed
up
you
are
going
back
do
you
understand
me
you
are
going
back
now
before
it
too
there
was
a
great
change
in
loder
his
strong
imperturbable
face
was
stirred
he
was
moved
in
both
voice
and
manner
time
after
time
he
repeated
his
injunction
reasoning
expostulating
insisting
it
almost
seemed
that
he
fought
some
strenuous
invisible
force
rather
than
the
shattered
man
before
him
chilcote
moved
nervously
in
his
seat
it
was
the
first
real
clash
of
personalities
he
felt
it
recognized
it
by
instinct
the
sense
of
domination
had
fallen
on
him
he
knew
himself
impotent
in
the
hands
whatever
he
might
attempt
in
moments
of
solitude
he
possessed
no
voice
in
presence
of
this
invincible
second
self
for
a
while
he
struggled
he
did
not
fight
he
struggled
to
resist
then
lifting
his
eyes
he
met
loder
and
what
will
you
do
he
said
weakly
loder
returned
his
questioning
gaze
but
almost
immediately
he
turned
aside
i
he
said
oh
i
shall
leave
xxvii
but
loder
did
not
leave
london
and
the
hour
of
two
on
the
day
following
his
dismissal
of
chilcote
found
him
again
in
his
he
sat
at
the
surrounded
by
a
cloud
of
smoke
a
pipe
was
between
his
lips
and
the
morning
newspapers
lay
in
a
heap
beside
his
elbow
to
the
student
of
humanity
his
attitude
was
intensely
interesting
it
was
the
attitude
of
a
man
trammelled
by
the
knowledge
of
his
strength
before
him
as
he
sat
smoking
stretched
a
future
of
absolute
nothingness
and
towards
this
blank
future
one
portion
of
his
consciousness
a
struggling
and
as
yet
scarcely
sentient
portion
pushed
him
inevitably
while
another
a
vigorous
persistent
human
portion
cried
to
him
to
pause
so
actual
so
clamorous
was
this
silent
mental
combat
that
had
raged
unceasingly
since
the
moment
of
his
renunciation
that
at
last
in
physical
response
to
it
he
pushed
back
his
chair
it
too
late
he
said
aloud
i
a
fool
it
too
late
then
abruptly
astonishingly
as
though
in
direct
response
to
his
spoken
thought
the
door
opened
and
chilcote
walked
into
the
room
slowly
loder
rose
and
stared
at
him
the
feeling
he
acknowledged
to
himself
was
anger
but
below
the
anger
a
very
different
sensation
ran
riotously
strong
and
it
was
in
time
to
this
second
feeling
this
sudden
lawless
joy
that
his
pulses
beat
as
he
turned
a
cold
face
on
the
intruder
well
he
said
sternly
but
chilcote
was
impervious
to
sternness
he
was
mentally
shaken
and
distressed
though
outwardly
irreproachable
even
to
the
violets
in
the
lapel
of
his
coat
the
violets
that
for
a
week
past
had
been
brought
each
morning
to
the
door
of
loder
rooms
by
eve
maid
for
one
second
as
loder
eyes
rested
on
the
flowers
a
sting
of
ungovernable
jealousy
shot
through
him
then
as
suddenly
it
died
away
superseded
by
another
feeling
a
feeling
of
new
spontaneous
joy
worn
by
chilcote
or
by
himself
the
flowers
were
a
symbol
well
he
said
again
in
a
gentler
voice
chilcote
had
walked
to
the
table
and
laid
down
his
hat
his
face
was
white
and
the
muscles
of
his
lips
twitched
nervously
as
he
drew
off
his
gloves
thank
heaven
you
here
he
said
shortly
give
me
something
to
in
silence
loder
brought
out
the
whiskey
and
set
it
on
the
table
then
instinctively
he
turned
aside
as
plainly
as
though
he
saw
the
action
he
mentally
figured
chilcote
furtive
glance
the
furtive
movement
of
his
fingers
to
his
the
hasty
dropping
of
the
tabloids
into
the
glass
for
an
instant
the
sense
of
his
tacit
connivance
came
to
him
sharply
the
next
he
flung
it
from
him
the
human
inner
voice
was
whispering
its
old
watchword
the
strong
man
has
no
time
to
waste
over
his
weaker
brother
when
he
heard
chilcote
lay
down
his
tumbler
he
looked
back
again
well
what
is
it
he
said
what
have
you
come
for
he
strove
resolutely
to
keep
his
voice
severe
but
try
as
he
might
he
could
not
quite
subdue
the
eager
force
that
lay
behind
his
words
once
again
as
on
the
night
of
their
second
interchange
life
had
become
a
phoenix
rising
to
fresh
existence
even
while
he
sifted
its
ashes
well
he
said
once
again
chilcote
had
set
down
his
glass
he
was
nervously
passing
his
handkerchief
across
his
lips
there
was
something
in
the
gesture
that
attracted
loder
looking
at
him
more
attentively
he
saw
what
his
own
feelings
and
the
other
conventional
dress
had
blinded
him
to
the
almost
piteous
panic
and
excitement
in
his
visitor
eyes
something
gone
wrong
he
said
with
abrupt
intuition
chilcote
started
yes
no
that
is
yes
he
stammered
loder
moved
round
the
table
something
gone
wrong
he
repeated
and
you
come
to
tell
the
tone
unnerved
chilcote
he
suddenly
dropped
into
a
chair
it
it
was
my
fault
he
began
i
i
have
had
a
horrible
time
loder
lips
tightened
yes
he
said
yes
i
the
other
glanced
up
with
a
gleam
of
his
old
suspicion
was
all
my
nerves
loder
of
course
yes
of
loder
interruption
was
curt
chilcote
eyed
him
doubtfully
then
recollection
took
the
place
of
doubt
and
a
change
passed
over
his
expression
it
was
my
fault
he
began
hastily
on
my
soul
it
was
it
was
crapham
beastly
fault
for
showing
her
into
the
loder
kept
silent
his
curiosity
had
flared
into
sudden
life
at
the
other
words
but
he
feared
to
break
the
shattered
train
of
thought
even
by
a
word
in
the
silence
chilcote
moved
uneasily
you
see
he
went
on
at
last
when
i
was
here
with
you
i
i
felt
strong
i
i
he
stopped
yes
yes
when
you
were
here
with
me
you
felt
yes
that
it
while
i
was
here
i
felt
i
could
do
the
thing
but
when
i
went
home
when
i
went
up
to
my
rooms
again
he
paused
passing
his
handkerchief
across
his
forehead
when
you
went
up
to
your
rooms
loder
strove
hard
to
keep
his
control
to
my
room
oh
i
i
forget
about
that
i
forget
about
the
night
he
hesitated
confusedly
all
i
remember
is
the
coming
down
to
breakfast
next
morning
this
morning
at
twelve
loder
turned
to
the
table
and
poured
himself
out
some
whiskey
yes
he
acquiesced
in
a
very
quiet
voice
at
the
word
chilcote
rose
from
his
seat
his
disquietude
was
very
evident
oh
there
was
breakfast
on
the
table
when
i
came
breakfast
with
flowers
and
a
horrible
dazzling
glare
of
sun
it
was
then
loder
as
i
stood
and
looked
into
the
room
that
the
impossibility
of
it
all
came
to
me
that
i
knew
i
could
stand
it
could
go
loder
swallowed
his
whiskey
slowly
his
sense
of
overpowering
curiosity
held
him
very
still
but
he
made
no
effort
to
prompt
his
companion
again
chilcote
shifted
his
position
agitatedly
it
had
to
be
done
he
said
disjointedly
i
had
to
do
it
then
and
there
the
things
were
on
the
bureau
the
pens
and
ink
and
telegraph
forms
they
tempted
loder
laid
down
his
glass
suddenly
an
exclamation
rose
to
his
lips
but
he
checked
it
at
the
slight
sound
of
the
tumbler
touching
the
table
chilcote
turned
but
there
was
no
expression
on
the
other
face
to
affright
him
they
tempted
me
he
repeated
hastily
they
seemed
like
magnets
they
seemed
to
draw
me
towards
them
i
sat
at
the
bureau
staring
at
them
for
a
long
time
then
a
terrible
compulsion
seized
me
something
you
could
never
understand
and
i
caught
up
the
nearest
pen
and
wrote
just
what
was
in
my
mind
it
was
a
telegram
properly
speaking
it
was
more
a
letter
i
wanted
you
back
and
i
had
to
make
myself
plain
the
writing
of
the
message
seemed
to
steady
me
the
mere
forming
of
the
words
quieted
my
mind
i
was
almost
cool
when
i
got
up
from
the
bureau
and
pressed
the
bell
the
bell
yes
i
rang
for
a
servant
i
had
to
send
the
wire
myself
so
i
had
to
get
a
his
voice
rose
to
irritability
i
pressed
the
bell
several
times
but
the
thing
had
gone
wrong
work
at
last
i
gave
it
up
and
went
into
the
corridor
to
call
some
well
in
the
intense
suspense
of
the
moment
the
word
escaped
loder
oh
i
went
out
of
the
room
but
there
at
the
door
before
i
could
call
anybody
i
knocked
up
against
that
idiot
greening
he
was
looking
for
me
for
you
rather
about
some
beastly
wark
affair
i
tried
to
explain
that
i
was
in
a
state
for
business
i
tried
to
shake
him
off
but
he
was
worse
than
blessington
at
last
to
be
rid
of
the
fellow
i
went
with
him
to
the
study
but
the
telegram
loder
began
then
again
he
checked
himself
yes
yes
i
understand
he
added
quietly
i
getting
to
the
telegram
i
wish
you
would
jar
me
with
sudden
questions
i
was
in
the
study
more
than
a
minute
more
than
five
or
six
minutes
his
voice
became
confused
the
strain
of
the
connected
recital
was
telling
upon
him
with
nervous
haste
he
made
a
rush
for
the
end
of
his
story
i
was
more
than
seven
or
eight
minutes
in
the
study
then
as
i
came
crapham
met
me
in
the
hall
he
told
me
that
lillian
astrupp
had
called
and
wished
to
see
me
and
that
he
had
shown
her
into
the
the
loder
suddenly
stepped
back
from
the
table
the
with
your
telegram
lying
on
the
bureau
his
sudden
speech
and
movement
startled
chilcote
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
then
died
out
leaving
it
ashen
do
do
that
loder
he
cried
i
i
ca
bear
it
with
an
immense
effort
loder
controlled
himself
sorry
he
said
go
on
i
going
on
i
tell
you
i
going
on
i
got
a
horrid
shock
when
chapham
told
me
your
story
came
clattering
through
my
mind
i
knew
lillian
had
come
to
see
you
i
knew
there
was
going
to
be
a
scene
but
the
telegram
the
telegram
chilcote
paid
no
heed
to
the
interruption
he
was
following
his
own
train
of
ideas
i
knew
she
had
come
to
see
you
i
knew
there
was
going
to
be
a
scene
when
i
got
to
the
my
hand
was
shaking
so
that
i
could
scarcely
turn
the
handle
then
as
the
door
opened
i
could
have
cried
out
with
relief
eve
was
there
as
well
eve
yes
i
do
think
i
was
ever
so
glad
to
see
her
in
my
he
laughed
almost
hysterically
i
was
quite
civil
to
her
and
she
was
quite
sweet
to
me
again
he
laughed
loder
lips
tightened
you
see
it
saved
the
situation
even
if
lillian
wanted
to
be
nasty
she
could
while
eve
was
there
we
talked
for
about
ten
minutes
we
were
quite
an
amiable
trio
then
lillian
told
me
why
she
called
she
wanted
me
to
make
a
fourth
in
a
theatre
party
at
the
and
i
i
was
so
pleased
and
so
relieved
that
i
said
yes
he
paused
and
laughed
again
unsteadily
in
his
tense
anxiety
loder
ground
his
heel
into
the
floor
go
on
he
said
fiercely
go
on
do
chilcote
exclaimed
i
going
on
i
going
he
passed
his
handkerchief
across
his
lips
we
talked
for
ten
minutes
or
so
and
then
lillian
left
i
went
with
her
to
the
hall
door
but
chapham
was
there
too
so
i
was
still
safe
she
laughed
and
chatted
and
seemed
in
high
spirits
as
we
crossed
the
hall
and
she
was
still
smiling
as
she
waved
to
me
from
her
motor
but
then
loder
then
as
i
stood
in
the
hall
it
all
came
to
me
suddenly
i
remembered
that
lillian
must
have
been
alone
in
the
before
eve
found
her
i
remembered
the
telegram
i
ran
back
to
the
room
meaning
to
question
eve
as
to
how
long
lillian
had
been
alone
but
she
had
left
the
room
i
ran
to
the
bureau
but
the
telegram
was
there
gone
yes
gone
that
why
i
come
straight
for
a
moment
they
confronted
each
other
then
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
loder
pushed
chilcote
aside
and
crossed
the
room
an
instant
later
the
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
the
hasty
pulling
out
of
drawers
and
moving
of
boxes
came
from
the
bedroom
chilcote
shaken
and
nervous
stood
for
a
minute
where
his
companion
had
left
him
at
last
impelled
by
curiosity
he
too
crossed
the
narrow
passage
and
entered
the
second
room
the
full
light
streamed
in
through
the
open
window
the
keen
spring
air
blew
freshly
across
the
and
on
the
a
band
of
grimy
joyous
sparrows
twittered
and
preened
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
loder
his
coat
was
off
and
round
him
on
chairs
and
floor
lay
an
array
of
waistcoats
gloves
and
ties
for
a
space
chilcote
stood
in
the
doorway
staring
at
him
then
his
lips
parted
and
he
took
a
step
forward
loder
he
said
anxiously
loder
what
are
you
going
to
do
loder
turned
his
shoulders
were
stiff
his
face
alight
with
energy
i
going
back
he
said
to
unravel
the
tangle
you
have
xxviii
loder
plan
of
action
was
arrived
at
before
he
reached
trafalgar
square
the
facts
of
the
case
were
simple
chilcote
had
left
an
incriminating
telegram
on
the
bureau
in
the
at
grosvenor
square
by
an
unlucky
chance
lillian
astrupp
had
been
shown
up
into
that
room
where
she
had
remained
alone
until
the
moment
that
eve
either
by
request
or
by
accident
had
found
her
there
the
facts
resolved
themselves
into
one
question
what
use
had
lillian
made
of
those
solitary
moments
without
deviation
loder
mind
turned
towards
one
answer
lillian
was
not
the
woman
to
lose
an
opportunity
whether
the
space
at
her
command
were
long
or
short
true
eve
too
had
been
alone
in
the
room
while
chilcote
had
accompanied
lillian
to
the
door
but
of
this
he
made
small
account
eve
had
been
there
but
lillian
had
been
there
first
judging
by
precedent
by
personal
character
by
all
human
probability
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
anything
would
have
been
left
for
the
second
comer
so
convinced
was
he
that
reaching
trafalgar
square
he
stopped
and
hailed
a
hansom
cadogan
gardens
he
called
no
the
moments
seemed
very
few
before
the
cab
drew
up
beside
the
curb
and
he
caught
his
second
glimpse
of
the
enamelled
door
with
its
silver
fittings
the
white
and
silver
gleamed
in
the
sunshine
banks
of
cream
colored
hyacinths
clustered
on
the
filling
the
clear
air
with
a
warm
and
fragrant
scent
with
that
strange
sensation
of
having
lived
through
the
scene
before
loder
left
the
cab
and
walked
up
the
steps
instantly
he
pressed
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
by
discreet
deferential
is
lady
astrupp
at
home
he
asked
the
man
looked
thoughtful
her
ladyship
lunched
at
home
sir
he
began
cautiously
but
loder
interrupted
him
ask
her
to
see
me
he
said
laconically
the
servant
expressed
no
surprise
his
only
comment
was
to
throw
the
door
wide
if
you
wait
in
the
white
room
sir
he
said
i
inform
her
chilcote
was
evidently
a
frequent
and
a
favored
visitor
in
this
manner
loder
for
the
second
time
entered
the
house
so
unfamiliar
and
yet
so
familiar
in
all
that
it
suggested
entering
the
he
had
leisure
to
look
about
him
it
was
a
beautiful
room
large
and
lofty
luxury
was
evident
on
every
hand
but
it
was
not
the
luxury
that
palls
or
offends
each
object
was
graceful
and
possessed
its
own
intrinsic
value
the
atmosphere
was
too
effeminate
to
appeal
to
him
but
he
acknowledged
the
taste
and
artistic
delicacy
it
conveyed
almost
at
the
moment
of
acknowledgment
the
door
opened
to
admit
lillian
she
wore
the
same
gown
of
cloth
warmed
and
softened
by
rich
furs
that
she
had
worn
on
the
day
she
and
chilcote
had
driven
in
the
park
she
was
drawing
on
her
gloves
as
she
came
into
the
room
and
pausing
near
the
door
she
looked
across
at
loder
and
laughed
in
her
slow
amused
way
i
thought
it
would
be
you
she
said
enigmatically
loder
came
forward
you
expected
me
he
said
guardedly
a
sudden
conviction
filled
him
that
it
was
not
the
evidence
of
her
eyes
but
something
at
once
subtler
and
more
definite
that
prompted
her
recognition
of
him
she
smiled
why
should
i
expect
you
on
the
contrary
i
waiting
to
know
why
you
here
he
was
silent
for
an
instant
then
he
answered
in
her
own
light
tone
as
far
as
that
goes
he
said
let
make
it
my
duty
dined
with
you
i
an
for
a
full
second
she
surveyed
him
amusedly
then
at
last
she
spoke
my
dear
jack
she
laid
particular
stress
on
the
name
i
never
imagined
you
punctilious
i
should
have
thought
bohemian
would
have
been
more
the
loder
felt
disconcerted
and
annoyed
either
like
himself
she
was
fishing
for
information
or
she
was
deliberately
playing
with
him
in
his
perplexity
he
glanced
across
the
room
towards
the
fireplace
lillian
saw
the
look
wo
you
sit
down
she
said
indicating
the
couch
i
promise
not
to
make
you
smoke
i
even
ask
you
to
take
off
your
gloves
loder
made
no
movement
his
mind
was
unpleasantly
upset
it
was
nearly
a
fortnight
since
he
had
seen
lillian
and
in
the
interval
her
attitude
had
changed
and
the
change
puzzled
him
it
might
mean
the
philosophy
of
a
woman
who
knowing
herself
without
adequate
weapons
withdraws
from
a
combat
that
has
proved
fruitless
or
it
might
imply
the
merely
catlike
desire
to
toy
with
a
certainty
he
looked
quickly
at
the
delicate
face
the
green
eyes
somewhat
obliquely
set
the
unreliable
mouth
and
instantly
he
inclined
to
the
latter
theory
the
conviction
that
she
possessed
the
telegram
filled
him
suddenly
and
with
it
came
the
desire
to
put
his
belief
to
the
test
to
know
beyond
question
whether
her
smiling
unconcern
meant
malice
or
mere
entertainment
when
you
first
came
into
the
room
he
said
quietly
you
said
thought
it
would
be
you
why
did
you
say
that
again
she
smiled
the
smile
that
might
be
malicious
or
might
be
merely
amused
oh
she
answered
at
last
i
only
meant
that
though
i
had
been
told
jack
chilcote
wanted
me
it
was
jack
chilcote
i
expected
to
see
after
her
statement
there
was
a
pause
loder
position
was
difficult
instinctively
convinced
that
strong
in
the
possession
of
her
proof
she
was
enjoying
his
tantalized
discomfort
he
yet
craved
the
actual
evidence
that
should
set
his
suspicions
to
rest
acting
upon
the
desire
he
made
a
new
beginning
do
you
know
why
i
came
he
asked
lillian
looked
up
innocently
it
so
hard
to
be
certain
of
anything
in
this
world
she
said
but
one
is
always
at
liberty
to
again
he
was
perplexed
her
attitude
was
not
quite
the
attitude
of
one
who
controls
the
game
and
yet
he
looked
at
her
with
a
puzzled
scrutiny
women
for
him
had
always
spelled
the
incomprehensible
he
was
at
his
best
his
strongest
his
surest
in
the
presence
of
men
feeling
his
disadvantage
yet
determined
to
gain
his
end
he
made
a
last
attempt
how
did
you
amuse
yourself
at
grosvenor
square
this
morning
before
eve
came
to
you
he
asked
the
effort
was
awkwardly
blunt
but
it
was
direct
lillian
was
buttoning
her
glove
she
did
not
raise
her
head
as
he
spoke
but
her
fingers
paused
in
their
task
for
a
second
she
remained
motionless
then
she
looked
up
slowly
oh
she
said
sweetly
so
i
was
right
in
my
guess
you
did
come
to
find
out
whether
i
sat
in
the
with
my
hands
in
my
lap
or
wandered
about
in
search
of
entertainment
loder
colored
with
annoyance
and
apprehension
every
look
every
tone
of
lillian
was
distasteful
to
him
no
microscope
could
have
revealed
her
more
fully
to
him
than
did
his
own
eyesight
but
it
was
not
the
moment
for
personal
antipathies
there
were
other
interests
than
his
own
at
stake
with
new
resolution
he
returned
her
glance
then
i
must
still
ask
my
first
question
why
did
you
say
thought
it
would
be
you
his
gaze
was
direct
so
direct
that
it
disconcerted
her
she
laughed
a
little
uneasily
because
i
how
did
you
know
because
she
began
then
again
she
laughed
because
she
added
quickly
as
if
moved
by
a
fresh
impulse
jack
chilcote
made
it
very
obvious
to
any
one
who
was
in
his
at
twelve
today
that
it
would
be
you
and
not
he
who
would
be
found
filling
his
place
this
afternoon
it
all
very
well
to
talk
about
honor
but
when
one
walks
into
an
empty
room
and
sees
a
telegram
as
long
as
a
letter
open
on
a
bureau
but
her
sentence
was
never
finished
loder
had
heard
what
he
came
to
hear
any
confession
she
might
have
to
offer
was
of
no
moment
in
his
eyes
my
dear
girl
he
broke
in
brusquely
do
trouble
i
should
make
a
most
unsatisfactory
father
he
spoke
quickly
his
color
was
still
high
but
not
of
annoyance
his
suspense
was
transformed
into
unpleasant
certainty
but
the
exchange
left
him
surer
of
himself
his
perplexity
had
dropped
to
a
quiet
sense
of
his
paramount
desire
was
for
solitude
in
which
to
prepare
for
the
task
that
lay
before
him
the
most
congenial
task
the
world
possessed
the
unravelling
of
chilcote
tangled
skeins
looking
into
lillian
eyes
he
smiled
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
i
think
we
finished
for
she
slowly
extended
her
fingers
her
expression
and
attitude
were
slightly
puzzled
a
puzzlement
that
was
either
spontaneous
or
singularly
well
assumed
as
their
hands
touched
she
smiled
again
will
you
drop
in
at
the
she
said
it
the
dramatized
version
of
men
shoes
the
temptation
to
make
you
see
it
was
too
irresistible
as
you
there
was
a
pause
while
she
waited
for
his
answer
her
head
inclined
to
one
side
her
green
eyes
gleaming
loder
conscious
of
her
regard
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
his
face
cleared
right
he
said
slowly
arcadian
tonight
xxix
loder
frame
of
mind
as
he
left
cadogan
gardens
was
peculiar
once
more
he
was
living
in
the
present
the
forceful
exhilarating
present
and
the
knowledge
braced
him
upon
one
point
his
mind
was
satisfied
lillian
astrupp
had
found
the
telegram
and
it
remained
to
him
to
render
her
find
valueless
how
he
proposed
to
do
this
how
he
proposed
to
come
out
triumphant
in
face
of
such
a
situation
was
a
matter
that
as
yet
was
shapeless
in
his
mind
nevertheless
the
danger
the
sense
of
impending
conflict
had
a
savor
of
life
after
the
inaction
of
the
day
and
night
just
passed
chilcote
in
his
weakness
and
his
entanglement
had
turned
to
him
and
he
in
his
strength
and
capacity
had
responded
to
the
appeal
his
step
was
firm
and
his
bearing
assured
as
he
turned
into
grosvenor
square
and
walked
towards
the
familiar
house
the
habit
of
is
as
insidious
and
tenacious
as
any
vice
for
one
moment
on
the
night
of
his
great
speech
as
he
leaned
out
of
chilcote
carriage
and
met
chilcote
eyes
loder
had
seen
himself
and
under
the
shock
of
revelation
had
taken
decisive
action
but
in
the
hours
subsequent
to
that
action
the
plausible
inner
voice
had
whispered
unceasingly
soothing
his
wounded
rebuilding
stone
by
stone
the
temple
of
his
egotism
until
at
last
when
chilcote
at
his
own
action
had
burst
into
his
rooms
ready
to
plead
or
to
coerce
he
had
found
no
need
for
either
coercion
or
entreaty
by
a
power
more
subtle
and
effective
than
any
at
his
command
loder
had
been
prepared
for
his
coming
unconsciously
ready
with
an
acquiescence
before
his
appeal
had
been
made
it
was
the
fruit
of
this
preparation
the
inevitable
outcome
of
it
that
strengthened
his
step
and
steadied
his
hand
as
he
mounted
the
steps
and
opened
the
hall
door
of
house
on
that
eventful
afternoon
the
dignity
the
air
of
quiet
solidity
impressed
him
as
it
never
failed
to
do
as
he
crossed
the
large
hall
and
ascended
the
stairs
the
same
stairs
that
he
had
passed
down
almost
as
an
outcast
not
so
many
hours
before
he
was
filled
with
the
sense
of
things
regained
belief
in
his
own
star
lifted
him
as
it
had
done
a
hundred
times
before
in
these
same
surroundings
he
quickened
his
steps
as
the
sensation
came
to
him
then
reaching
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
turned
directly
towards
eve
and
gaining
the
door
knocked
the
strength
of
his
eagerness
the
quick
beating
of
his
pulse
as
he
waited
for
a
response
surprised
him
he
had
told
himself
many
times
that
his
passion
however
strong
would
never
again
conquer
as
it
had
done
two
nights
ago
and
the
fact
that
he
had
come
thus
candidly
to
eve
room
was
to
his
mind
a
proof
that
temptation
could
be
dared
nevertheless
there
was
something
disconcerting
to
a
strong
man
in
this
merely
physical
perturbation
and
when
eve
voice
came
to
him
giving
permission
to
enter
he
paused
for
an
instant
to
steady
himself
then
with
sudden
decision
he
opened
the
door
and
walked
into
the
room
the
blinds
were
partly
drawn
there
was
a
scent
of
violets
in
the
air
and
a
fire
glowed
warmly
in
the
grate
he
noted
these
things
carefully
telling
himself
that
a
man
should
always
be
alertly
sensible
of
his
surroundings
then
all
at
once
the
nice
balancing
of
detail
suddenly
gave
way
he
forgot
everything
but
the
one
circumstance
that
eve
was
standing
in
the
window
her
back
to
the
light
her
face
towards
him
with
his
pulses
beating
faster
and
an
unsteady
sensation
in
his
brain
he
moved
forward
holding
out
his
hand
eve
he
said
below
his
breath
but
eve
remained
motionless
as
he
came
into
the
room
she
had
glanced
at
him
a
glance
of
quick
searching
question
then
with
equal
suddenness
she
had
averted
her
eyes
as
he
drew
close
to
her
now
she
remained
immovable
eve
he
said
again
i
wanted
to
see
you
i
wanted
to
explain
about
yesterday
and
about
this
he
paused
suddenly
disturbed
the
full
remembrance
of
the
scene
in
the
brougham
had
surged
up
at
sight
of
her
had
risen
a
fierce
unquenchable
recollection
eve
he
began
again
in
a
new
abrupt
tone
and
then
it
was
that
eve
showed
herself
in
a
fresh
light
from
his
entrance
into
the
room
she
had
stayed
motionless
save
for
her
first
glance
of
acute
inquiry
but
now
her
demeanor
changed
for
almost
the
first
time
in
loder
knowledge
of
her
the
vitality
and
force
that
he
had
vaguely
apprehended
below
her
quiet
serene
exterior
sprang
up
like
a
flame
within
whose
radius
things
are
illuminated
with
a
quick
gesture
she
turned
towards
him
her
warm
color
deepening
her
eyes
suddenly
alight
i
understand
she
said
i
understand
do
try
to
explain
ca
you
see
that
it
enough
to
to
see
you
as
you
are
loder
was
surprised
remembering
their
last
passionate
scene
and
the
damper
chilcote
subsequent
presence
must
inevitably
have
cast
upon
it
he
had
expected
to
be
doubtfully
received
but
the
reality
of
the
reception
left
him
bewildered
eve
manner
was
not
that
of
the
wife
its
vehemence
its
note
of
desire
and
depreciation
were
more
suggestive
of
his
own
ardent
seizing
of
the
present
as
distinguished
from
past
or
future
with
an
odd
sense
of
confusion
he
turned
to
her
afresh
then
i
am
forgiven
he
said
and
unconsciously
as
he
moved
nearer
he
touched
her
arm
at
his
touch
she
started
all
the
yielding
sweetness
all
the
submission
that
had
marked
her
two
nights
ago
was
gone
in
its
place
she
was
possessed
by
a
curious
excitement
that
stirred
while
it
perplexed
loder
moved
by
the
sensation
took
another
step
forward
then
i
am
forgiven
he
repeated
more
softly
her
face
was
averted
as
he
spoke
but
he
felt
hen
arm
quiver
and
when
at
last
she
lifted
her
head
their
eyes
met
neither
spoke
but
in
an
instant
loder
arms
were
round
her
for
a
long
silent
space
they
stood
holding
each
other
closely
then
with
a
sharp
movement
eve
freed
herself
her
color
was
still
high
her
eyes
still
peculiarly
bright
but
the
bunch
of
violets
she
had
worn
in
her
belt
had
fallen
to
the
ground
john
she
said
quickly
but
on
the
word
her
breath
caught
with
a
touch
of
nervousness
she
stooped
to
pick
up
the
flowers
loder
noticed
both
voice
and
gesture
what
is
it
he
said
what
were
you
going
to
say
but
she
made
no
answer
for
a
second
longer
she
searched
for
the
violets
then
as
he
bent
to
assist
her
she
stood
up
quickly
and
laughed
a
short
embarrassed
laugh
how
absurd
and
nervous
i
am
she
exclaimed
like
a
schoolgirl
instead
of
a
woman
of
you
must
help
me
to
be
her
cheeks
still
burned
her
manner
was
still
excited
like
one
who
holds
an
emotion
or
an
impulse
at
bay
loder
looked
at
her
uncertainly
eve
he
began
afresh
with
his
odd
characteristic
perseverance
but
she
instantly
checked
him
there
was
a
finality
a
faint
suggestion
of
fear
in
her
protest
do
she
said
do
i
do
want
explanations
i
want
to
to
enjoy
the
moment
without
having
things
analyzed
or
smoothed
away
you
understand
ca
you
see
that
i
wonderfully
terribly
happy
to
to
have
you
as
you
are
again
her
voice
broke
a
break
that
might
have
been
a
laugh
or
a
sob
the
sound
was
an
emotional
crisis
as
such
a
sound
invariably
is
it
arrested
and
steadied
her
for
a
moment
she
stood
absolutely
still
then
with
something
very
closely
resembling
her
old
repose
of
manner
she
stooped
again
and
quietly
picked
up
the
flowers
still
lying
at
her
feet
now
she
said
quietly
i
must
say
what
i
wanted
to
say
all
along
how
does
it
feel
to
be
a
great
man
her
manner
was
controlled
she
looked
at
him
evenly
and
directly
save
for
the
faint
vibration
in
her
voice
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
the
tumult
of
a
moment
ago
but
loder
was
still
uncertain
he
caught
her
hand
his
eyes
searching
hers
but
eve
he
began
then
eve
played
the
last
card
in
her
mysterious
game
laughing
quickly
and
nervously
she
freed
her
hand
and
laid
it
over
his
mouth
no
she
said
not
one
word
all
this
past
fortnight
has
belonged
to
you
now
it
my
turn
is
xxx
and
so
once
again
the
woman
conquered
whatever
eve
intentions
were
whatever
she
wished
to
evade
or
ward
off
she
was
successful
in
gaining
her
end
for
more
than
two
hours
she
kept
loder
at
her
side
there
may
have
been
moments
in
those
two
hours
when
the
tension
was
high
when
the
efforts
she
made
to
interest
and
hold
him
were
somewhat
strained
but
if
this
was
so
it
escaped
the
notice
of
the
one
person
concerned
for
it
was
long
after
tea
had
been
served
long
after
eve
had
offered
to
do
penance
for
her
monopoly
of
him
by
driving
him
to
chilcote
club
that
loder
realized
with
any
degree
of
distinctness
that
it
was
she
and
not
he
who
had
taken
the
lead
in
their
interview
that
it
was
she
and
not
he
who
had
bridged
the
difficult
silences
and
given
a
fresh
direction
to
dangerous
channels
of
talk
it
was
long
before
he
recognized
this
but
it
was
still
longer
before
he
realized
the
far
more
potent
fact
that
without
any
coldness
without
any
lessening
of
the
subtle
consideration
she
always
showed
him
she
had
given
him
no
further
opportunity
of
making
love
talking
continuously
elated
with
the
sense
of
conflict
still
to
come
he
drove
with
her
to
the
club
considering
that
drive
in
the
light
of
after
events
his
own
frame
of
mind
invariably
filled
him
with
incredulity
in
the
eyes
of
any
sane
man
his
position
was
not
worth
an
purchase
yet
in
the
blind
of
the
moment
he
would
not
have
changed
places
with
fraide
himself
the
great
song
of
self
was
sounding
in
his
ears
as
he
drove
through
the
crowded
streets
conscious
of
the
cool
crisp
air
of
eve
close
presence
of
the
numberless
infinitesimal
things
that
went
to
make
up
the
value
of
life
it
was
this
acknowledgment
of
personality
that
upheld
him
the
personality
the
power
that
had
carried
him
unswervingly
through
eleven
colorless
years
that
had
impelled
him
towards
this
new
career
when
the
new
career
had
first
been
opened
to
him
that
had
hewn
a
way
for
him
in
this
fresh
existence
against
colossal
odds
the
indomitable
force
that
had
trampled
out
chilcote
footmarks
in
public
life
in
private
life
in
love
it
was
a
triumphant
paean
that
clamored
in
his
ears
something
persistent
and
prophetic
with
an
undernote
of
menace
the
cry
of
the
human
soul
that
has
dared
to
stand
alone
his
glance
was
keen
and
bright
as
he
waited
for
a
moment
at
the
carriage
door
and
took
eve
hand
before
entering
the
club
you
dining
out
he
said
his
fingers
always
tenacious
and
masterful
continued
to
hold
hers
the
compunction
that
had
driven
him
temporarily
towards
sacrifice
had
passed
his
pride
his
confidence
and
with
them
his
desire
had
flowed
back
in
full
measure
eve
watching
him
attentively
paled
a
little
yes
she
said
dining
with
the
what
time
will
you
get
home
he
scarcely
realized
why
he
put
the
question
the
song
of
self
still
sounded
triumphantly
and
he
responded
without
reflection
his
eyes
held
hers
his
fingers
pressed
her
hand
the
intense
mastery
of
his
will
passed
through
her
in
a
sudden
sense
of
fear
her
lips
parted
in
deprecation
but
he
closely
attentive
of
her
expression
spoke
again
quickly
when
can
i
see
you
he
asked
very
quietly
again
she
was
about
to
speak
she
leaned
forward
as
if
some
thought
long
suppressed
trembled
on
her
lips
then
her
courage
or
her
desire
failed
her
she
leaned
back
letting
her
lashes
droop
over
her
eyes
i
shall
be
home
at
eleven
she
said
below
her
breath
loder
dined
with
lakely
at
chilcote
club
and
so
absorbing
were
the
political
interests
of
the
hour
the
resignation
of
sir
robert
sefborough
the
king
summoning
of
fraide
the
probable
features
of
the
new
ministry
that
it
was
after
nine
when
at
last
he
freed
himself
and
drove
to
the
arcadian
theatre
the
sound
of
music
came
to
him
as
he
entered
the
theatre
light
measured
music
suggestive
of
tiny
streams
toy
lambs
and
painted
shepherdesses
it
sounded
singularly
inappropriate
to
his
mood
as
inappropriate
as
the
theatre
itself
with
its
gay
gilding
its
pale
tones
of
pink
and
blue
it
was
the
setting
of
a
different
world
a
world
of
laughter
light
thoughts
and
shallow
impulses
in
which
he
had
no
part
he
halted
for
an
instant
outside
the
box
to
which
the
attendant
had
shown
him
then
as
the
door
was
thrown
open
he
straightened
himself
resolutely
and
stepped
forward
it
was
the
interval
between
the
first
and
second
acts
the
box
was
in
shadow
and
loder
first
impression
was
of
voices
and
rustling
skirts
broken
in
upon
by
the
murmur
of
frequent
amused
laughter
later
as
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
light
he
distinguished
the
occupants
two
women
and
a
man
the
man
was
speaking
as
he
entered
and
the
story
he
was
relating
was
evidently
interesting
from
the
faint
exclamations
of
question
and
delight
that
punctuated
it
in
the
listeners
higher
softer
voices
as
the
entered
they
all
three
turned
and
looked
at
him
ah
here
comes
the
legislator
exclaimed
leonard
kaine
for
it
was
he
who
formed
the
male
element
in
the
party
the
revolutionary
lennie
lillian
corrected
softly
bramfell
says
he
has
changed
the
whole
face
of
things
she
laughed
softly
and
meaningly
as
she
closed
her
fan
so
good
of
you
to
come
jack
she
added
let
me
introduce
you
to
miss
esseltyn
i
do
think
you
two
have
met
this
is
chilcote
mary
the
great
new
again
she
laughed
loder
bowed
and
moved
to
the
front
of
the
box
nodding
to
kaine
as
he
passed
it
only
for
an
hour
he
explained
to
lillian
i
have
an
appointment
for
he
turned
and
bowed
to
the
third
occupant
of
the
box
a
remarkably
young
and
girl
with
eyes
and
a
retrousse
nose
only
an
hour
oh
how
unkind
how
should
i
punish
him
lennie
lillian
looked
round
at
kaine
with
a
lingering
caressing
glance
he
bent
towards
her
in
quick
response
and
answered
in
a
whisper
she
laughed
and
replied
in
an
equally
low
tone
loder
to
whom
both
remarks
had
been
inaudible
dropped
into
the
vacant
seat
beside
mary
esseltyn
he
had
the
unsettled
feeling
that
things
were
not
falling
out
exactly
as
he
had
calculated
what
is
the
play
like
he
hazarded
as
he
looked
towards
his
companion
at
all
times
social
trivialities
bored
him
they
were
intolerable
he
had
come
to
fight
but
all
at
once
it
seemed
that
there
was
no
opponent
lillian
attitude
disturbed
him
her
careless
graciousness
her
evident
ignoring
of
him
for
kaine
might
mean
nothing
but
also
it
might
mean
much
so
he
speculated
as
he
put
his
question
and
spurred
his
attention
towards
the
girl
answer
but
with
the
speculation
came
the
resolve
to
hold
his
own
to
meet
his
enemy
upon
whatever
ground
she
chose
to
appropriate
the
girl
looked
at
him
with
interest
she
too
had
heard
of
his
triumph
it
is
a
good
play
she
responded
i
like
it
better
than
the
book
you
read
the
book
of
course
loder
tried
hard
to
fix
his
thoughts
it
amusing
but
indeed
he
picked
up
the
programme
lying
on
the
edge
of
the
box
his
ears
were
strained
to
catch
the
tone
of
lillian
voice
as
she
laughed
and
whispered
with
kaine
yes
men
exchanging
identities
you
he
looked
up
and
caught
the
girl
glance
oh
he
said
indeed
then
again
he
looked
away
it
was
intolerable
this
feeling
of
being
caged
up
a
sense
of
anger
crept
through
his
mind
it
almost
seemed
that
lillian
had
brought
him
there
to
prove
that
she
had
finished
with
him
had
cast
him
aside
having
used
him
for
the
day
excitement
as
she
had
used
her
poodles
her
persian
cats
her
all
at
once
the
impotency
and
uncertainty
of
his
position
goaded
him
turning
swiftly
in
his
seat
he
glanced
back
to
where
she
sat
slowly
swaying
her
fan
her
pale
golden
hair
and
her
gown
delicately
silhouetted
against
the
background
of
the
box
what
your
idea
of
the
play
lillian
he
said
abruptly
to
his
own
ears
there
was
a
note
of
challenge
in
his
voice
she
looked
round
languidly
oh
it
quite
amusing
she
said
it
makes
a
delicious
farce
absolutely
french
quite
do
you
think
so
lennie
oh
quite
kaine
agreed
they
mean
that
it
so
very
light
and
yet
so
very
subtle
chilcote
mary
esseltyn
explained
indeed
he
said
then
my
imagination
was
at
fault
i
thought
the
piece
was
serious
lillian
smiled
again
why
where
your
sense
of
humor
the
motive
of
the
play
debars
all
loder
looked
down
at
the
programme
still
between
his
hands
what
is
the
motive
he
asked
lillian
waved
her
fan
once
or
twice
then
closed
it
softly
love
is
the
motive
she
said
now
the
balancing
the
adjusting
of
impression
and
inspirations
of
all
processes
in
life
the
most
delicately
fine
the
simple
sound
of
the
word
love
coming
at
that
precise
juncture
changed
the
whole
current
of
loder
thought
it
fell
like
a
seed
and
like
a
seed
in
soil
it
bore
fruit
with
amazing
rapidity
the
word
itself
was
small
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
spoken
trivial
but
loder
mind
was
attracted
and
held
by
it
the
last
time
it
had
met
his
ears
his
environment
had
been
vastly
different
and
this
echo
of
it
in
an
uncongenial
atmosphere
stung
him
to
resentment
the
vision
of
eve
the
thought
of
eve
became
suddenly
dominant
love
he
repeated
coldly
so
love
is
the
motive
this
time
it
was
kaine
who
responded
in
his
methodical
contented
voice
the
motive
of
the
play
is
love
as
lillian
says
and
when
was
love
ever
serious
in
a
comedy
on
or
off
the
stage
he
leaned
forward
in
his
seat
screwed
in
his
and
lazily
scanned
the
stalls
the
orchestra
was
playing
a
hungarian
dance
its
erratic
harmonies
and
wild
alternations
of
expression
falling
abruptly
across
the
pinks
and
blues
the
gilding
and
lights
of
the
pretty
conventional
theatre
something
in
the
suggestion
of
unfitness
appealed
to
loder
it
was
the
force
of
the
real
as
opposed
to
the
ideal
with
a
new
expression
on
his
face
he
turned
again
to
kaine
and
how
does
it
work
he
said
this
treatment
that
you
find
so
french
his
voice
as
well
as
his
expression
had
changed
he
still
spoke
quietly
but
he
spoke
with
interest
he
was
no
longer
conscious
of
his
vague
and
uneasiness
a
fresh
chord
had
been
struck
in
his
mind
and
his
curiosity
had
responded
to
it
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
him
that
love
the
dangerous
mysterious
garden
whose
paths
had
so
suddenly
stretched
out
before
his
own
feet
was
a
that
possessed
many
doors
and
an
infinite
number
of
keys
he
was
stirred
by
the
desire
to
peer
through
another
entrance
than
his
own
to
see
the
secret
alluring
byways
from
another
he
waited
with
interest
for
the
answer
to
his
question
for
a
second
or
two
kaine
continued
to
survey
the
house
then
his
dropped
from
his
eye
and
he
turned
round
to
understand
the
thing
he
said
pleasantly
you
must
have
read
the
book
have
you
read
the
book
no
kaine
mary
esseltyn
interrupted
mr
chilcote
has
read
the
lillian
laughed
outline
the
story
for
him
lennie
she
said
i
love
to
see
other
people
taking
kaine
glanced
at
her
admiringly
well
to
begin
with
he
said
amiably
two
men
an
artist
and
a
millionaire
exchange
lives
see
you
may
presume
that
he
does
see
right
well
then
as
i
say
these
beggars
change
identities
as
like
as
pins
and
to
all
appearances
one
chap
the
other
chap
and
the
other
chap
the
first
chap
see
loder
laughed
the
newly
quickened
interest
was
enhanced
by
treading
on
dangerous
ground
well
they
change
for
a
lark
of
course
but
there
one
fact
they
both
overlook
they
men
you
know
and
they
forget
these
little
things
he
laughed
delightedly
they
overlook
the
fact
that
one
of
has
got
a
wife
there
was
a
crash
of
music
from
the
orchestra
loder
sat
straighter
in
his
seat
he
was
conscious
that
the
blood
had
rushed
into
his
face
oh
indeed
he
said
quickly
one
of
them
had
a
wife
exactly
again
kaine
chuckled
and
the
point
of
the
joke
is
that
the
wife
is
the
least
larky
person
under
the
sun
see
a
second
hot
wave
passed
over
loder
face
a
sense
of
mental
disgust
filled
him
this
then
was
the
wonderful
garden
seen
from
another
he
looked
from
lillian
graceful
sceptical
and
shallow
to
the
young
girl
beside
him
so
frankly
modern
in
her
appreciation
of
life
this
then
was
love
as
seen
by
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
world
that
accepts
judges
and
condemns
in
a
slang
phrase
or
two
very
slowly
the
blood
receded
from
his
face
and
the
end
of
the
story
he
asked
in
a
strained
voice
the
end
oh
usual
end
of
course
chap
makes
a
mess
of
things
and
the
bubble
and
the
end
of
the
wife
the
end
of
the
wife
lillian
broke
in
with
a
little
laugh
why
the
end
of
all
stupid
people
who
instead
of
going
through
life
with
a
lot
of
delightfully
human
stumbles
come
just
one
big
cropper
she
naturally
ends
in
the
divorce
court
they
all
laughed
boisterously
then
laughter
story
and
denouement
were
all
drowned
in
a
tumultuous
crash
of
music
the
orchestra
ceased
there
was
a
slight
hum
of
applause
and
the
curtain
rose
on
the
second
act
of
the
comedy
xxxi
a
few
minutes
before
the
curtain
fell
on
the
second
act
of
shoes
loder
rose
from
his
seat
and
made
his
apologies
to
lillian
at
any
other
moment
he
might
have
pondered
over
her
manner
of
accepting
them
the
easy
indifference
with
which
she
let
him
go
but
vastly
keener
issues
were
claiming
his
attention
issues
whose
results
were
wide
and
black
he
left
the
theatre
and
refusing
the
overtures
of
cabmen
set
himself
to
walk
to
chilcote
house
his
face
was
hard
and
emotionless
as
he
hurried
forward
but
the
chaos
in
his
mind
found
expression
in
the
unevenness
of
his
pace
to
a
strong
man
the
confronting
of
difficulties
is
never
alarming
and
is
often
fraught
with
inspiration
but
this
applies
essentially
to
the
difficulties
evolved
through
the
weakness
the
folly
or
the
force
of
another
when
they
arise
from
within
the
matter
is
of
another
character
it
is
in
presence
of
his
own
soul
and
in
that
presence
alone
that
a
man
may
truly
measure
himself
as
loder
walked
onward
treading
the
whole
familiar
length
of
street
he
realized
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
standing
before
that
solemn
tribunal
that
the
hour
had
come
when
he
must
answer
to
himself
for
himself
the
longer
and
deeper
an
oblivion
the
more
painful
the
awakening
for
months
the
song
of
self
had
beaten
about
his
ears
deadening
all
other
sounds
now
abruptly
that
song
had
ceased
not
considerately
not
lingeringly
but
with
a
suddenness
that
made
the
succeeding
silence
very
terrible
he
walked
onward
keeping
his
direction
unseeingly
he
was
passing
through
the
fire
as
surely
as
though
actual
flames
rose
about
his
feet
and
whatever
the
result
whatever
the
fibre
of
the
man
who
emerged
from
the
ordeal
the
john
loder
who
had
hewn
his
way
through
the
past
weeks
would
exist
no
more
the
triumphant
egotist
the
strong
man
who
by
his
own
strength
had
kept
his
eyes
upon
one
point
refusing
to
see
in
other
directions
had
ceased
to
be
keen
though
it
was
his
realization
of
this
crisis
in
his
life
had
come
with
characteristic
slowness
when
lillian
astrupp
had
given
her
dictum
when
the
music
of
the
orchestra
had
ceased
and
the
curtain
risen
on
the
second
act
of
the
play
nothing
but
a
sense
of
stupefaction
had
filled
his
mind
in
that
moment
the
great
song
was
silenced
not
by
any
portentous
episode
not
by
any
incident
that
could
have
lent
dignity
to
its
end
but
with
the
full
measure
of
life
irony
by
a
trivial
social
commonplace
in
the
first
sensation
of
blank
loss
his
faculties
had
been
numbed
in
the
quarter
of
an
hour
that
followed
the
rise
of
the
curtain
he
had
sat
staring
at
the
stage
seeing
nothing
hearing
nothing
filled
with
the
enormity
of
the
void
that
suddenly
surrounded
him
then
from
habit
from
constitutional
tendency
he
had
begun
slowly
and
perseveringly
to
draw
first
one
thread
and
then
another
from
the
tangle
of
his
thoughts
to
forge
with
doubt
and
difficulty
the
chain
that
was
to
draw
him
towards
the
future
it
was
upon
this
same
incomplete
and
yet
tenacious
chain
that
his
mind
worked
as
he
traversed
the
familiar
streets
and
at
last
gained
the
house
he
had
so
easily
learned
to
call
home
as
he
inserted
the
and
felt
it
move
smoothly
in
the
lock
a
momentary
revolt
against
his
own
judgment
his
own
censorship
swung
him
sharply
towards
reaction
but
it
is
only
the
blind
who
can
walk
without
a
tremor
on
the
edge
of
an
abyss
and
there
was
no
longer
a
bandage
across
his
eyes
the
reaction
flared
up
like
a
strip
of
lighted
paper
then
like
a
strip
of
lighted
paper
it
dropped
back
to
ashes
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
slowly
crossed
the
hall
the
mounting
of
a
staircase
is
often
the
index
to
a
man
state
of
mind
as
loder
ascended
the
stairs
of
chilcote
house
his
shoulders
lacked
their
stiffness
his
head
was
no
longer
erect
he
moved
as
though
his
feet
were
weighted
he
had
ceased
to
be
the
man
of
achievement
whose
smallest
opinion
compels
consideration
in
the
privacy
of
solitude
he
was
the
mere
human
flotsam
to
which
he
had
once
compared
himself
the
flotsam
that
dreaming
it
has
found
a
harbor
wakes
to
find
itself
the
prey
of
the
incoming
tide
he
paused
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
rally
his
resolutions
then
still
walking
heavily
he
passed
down
the
corridor
to
eve
room
it
was
suggestive
of
his
character
that
having
made
his
decision
he
did
not
dally
over
its
performance
without
waiting
to
knock
he
turned
the
handle
and
walked
into
the
room
it
looked
precisely
as
it
always
looked
but
to
loder
the
rich
subdued
coloring
of
books
and
flowers
the
whole
air
of
culture
and
repose
that
the
place
conveyed
seemed
to
hold
a
deeper
meaning
than
before
and
it
was
on
the
instant
that
his
eyes
crossing
the
inanimate
objects
rested
on
their
owner
that
the
true
force
of
his
position
the
enormity
of
the
task
before
him
made
itself
plain
realization
came
to
him
with
vivid
overwhelming
force
and
it
must
be
accounted
to
his
credit
in
the
summing
of
his
qualities
that
then
in
that
moment
of
trial
the
thought
of
retreat
the
thought
of
yielding
did
not
present
itself
eve
was
standing
by
the
she
wore
a
beautiful
gown
a
long
string
of
diamonds
was
twisted
about
her
neck
and
her
soft
black
hair
was
coiled
high
after
a
foreign
fashion
and
held
in
place
by
a
large
diamond
comb
as
he
entered
she
turned
hastily
almost
nervously
and
looked
at
him
with
the
rapid
searching
glance
he
had
learned
to
expect
from
her
then
almost
directly
her
expression
changed
to
one
of
quick
concern
with
a
faint
exclamation
of
alarm
she
stepped
forward
what
has
happened
she
said
you
look
like
a
loder
made
no
answer
moving
into
the
room
he
paused
by
the
oak
table
that
stood
between
the
fireplace
and
the
door
they
made
an
unconscious
tableau
as
they
stood
there
he
with
his
hard
set
face
she
with
her
heightened
color
her
inexplicably
bright
eyes
they
stood
completely
silent
for
a
space
a
space
that
for
loder
held
no
suggestion
of
time
then
finding
the
tension
unbearable
eve
spoke
again
has
anything
happened
she
asked
is
any
thing
wrong
had
he
been
less
engrossed
the
intensity
of
her
concern
might
have
struck
him
but
in
a
mind
so
harassed
as
his
there
was
only
room
for
one
consideration
the
consideration
of
himself
the
sense
of
her
question
reached
him
but
its
significance
left
him
untouched
is
anything
wrong
she
reiterated
for
the
second
time
by
an
effort
he
raised
his
eyes
no
man
he
thought
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
was
ever
set
a
task
so
cruel
as
his
painfully
and
slowly
his
lips
parted
everything
in
the
world
is
wrong
he
said
in
a
slow
hard
voice
eve
said
nothing
but
her
color
suddenly
deepened
again
loder
was
unobservant
but
with
the
dogged
resolution
that
marked
him
he
forced
himself
to
his
task
you
despise
lies
he
said
at
last
tell
me
what
you
would
think
of
a
man
whose
whole
life
was
one
elaborated
lie
the
words
were
slightly
exaggerated
but
their
utterance
their
painfully
brusque
sincerity
precluded
all
suggestion
of
effect
resolutely
holding
her
gaze
he
repeated
his
question
tell
me
answer
me
i
want
to
eve
attitude
was
difficult
to
read
she
stood
twisting
the
string
of
diamonds
between
her
fingers
tell
me
he
said
again
she
continued
to
look
at
him
for
a
moment
then
as
if
some
fresh
impulse
moved
her
she
turned
away
from
him
towards
the
fire
i
can
not
she
said
we
i
i
could
not
set
myself
to
judge
any
loder
held
himself
rigidly
in
hand
eve
he
said
quietly
i
was
at
the
the
play
was
men
shoes
i
suppose
you
read
the
book
shoes
she
was
leaning
on
the
and
her
face
was
invisible
to
him
yes
i
have
read
it
she
said
without
looking
round
it
is
the
story
of
an
extraordinary
likeness
between
two
men
do
you
believe
such
a
likeness
possible
do
you
think
such
a
thing
could
exist
he
spoke
with
difficulty
his
brain
and
tongue
both
felt
numb
eve
let
the
diamond
chain
slip
from
her
fingers
yes
she
said
nervously
yes
i
do
believe
it
such
things
have
been
loder
caught
at
the
words
you
quite
right
he
said
quickly
you
quite
right
the
thing
is
possible
i
proved
it
i
know
a
man
so
like
me
that
you
even
you
could
not
tell
us
eve
was
silent
still
averting
her
face
in
dire
difficulty
he
labored
on
eve
he
began
once
more
such
a
likeness
is
a
serious
thing
a
terrible
danger
a
terrible
temptation
those
who
have
no
experience
of
it
can
not
possibly
gauge
its
pitfalls
again
he
paused
but
again
the
silent
figure
by
the
fireplace
gave
him
no
help
eve
he
exclaimed
suddenly
if
you
only
knew
if
you
only
guessed
what
i
trying
to
say
the
perplexity
the
whole
harassed
suffering
of
his
mind
showed
in
the
words
loder
the
strong
the
resourceful
the
was
palpably
painfully
at
a
loss
there
was
almost
a
note
of
appeal
in
the
vibration
of
his
voice
and
eve
standing
by
the
fireplace
heard
and
understood
in
that
moment
of
comprehension
all
that
had
held
her
silent
all
the
conflicting
motives
that
had
forbidden
speech
melted
away
before
the
unconscious
demand
for
help
quietly
and
yet
quickly
she
turned
her
whole
face
transfigured
by
a
light
that
seemed
to
shine
from
within
something
singularly
soft
and
tender
there
no
need
to
say
anything
she
said
simply
because
i
it
came
quietly
as
most
great
revelations
come
her
voice
was
low
and
free
from
any
excitement
her
face
beautiful
in
its
complete
unconsciousness
of
self
in
that
supreme
moment
all
her
thought
all
her
sympathy
was
for
the
man
and
his
suffering
to
loder
there
was
a
space
of
incredulity
then
his
brain
slowly
swung
to
realization
you
know
he
repeated
blankly
you
know
without
answering
she
walked
to
a
cabinet
that
stood
in
the
window
unlocked
a
drawer
and
drew
out
several
sheets
of
flimsy
white
paper
crumpled
in
places
and
closely
covered
with
writing
without
a
word
she
carried
them
back
and
held
them
out
he
took
them
in
silence
scanned
them
then
looked
up
in
a
long
worthless
pause
their
eyes
met
it
was
as
if
each
looked
speechlessly
into
the
other
heart
seeing
the
passions
the
contradictions
the
shortcomings
that
went
to
the
making
of
both
in
that
silence
they
drew
closer
together
than
they
could
have
done
through
a
torrent
of
words
there
was
no
asking
of
forgiveness
no
elaborate
confession
on
either
side
in
the
deep
eloquent
pause
they
mutually
saw
and
mutually
understood
when
i
came
into
the
eve
said
at
last
and
saw
lillian
astrupp
reading
that
telegram
nothing
could
have
seemed
further
from
me
than
the
thought
that
i
should
follow
her
example
it
was
not
until
afterwards
not
until
he
came
into
the
room
until
i
saw
that
you
as
i
believed
had
fallen
back
again
from
what
i
respected
to
what
i
despised
that
i
knew
how
human
i
really
was
as
i
watched
them
laugh
and
talk
i
felt
suddenly
that
i
was
alone
again
terribly
alone
i
i
think
i
believe
i
was
jealous
in
that
moment
she
hesitated
eve
he
exclaimed
but
she
broke
in
quickly
on
the
word
i
felt
different
in
that
moment
i
did
care
about
honor
or
things
like
honor
after
they
had
gone
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
missed
something
something
that
they
possessed
oh
you
do
know
what
a
woman
feels
when
she
is
jealous
again
she
paused
it
was
then
that
the
telegram
and
the
thought
of
amused
smile
as
she
had
read
it
came
to
my
mind
feeling
as
i
did
acting
on
what
i
felt
i
crossed
to
the
bureau
and
picked
it
up
in
one
second
i
had
seen
enough
to
make
it
impossible
to
draw
back
oh
it
may
have
been
dishonorable
it
may
have
been
mean
but
i
wonder
if
any
woman
in
the
world
would
have
done
otherwise
i
crumpled
up
the
papers
just
as
they
were
and
carried
them
to
my
own
from
the
first
to
the
last
word
of
eve
story
loder
eyes
never
left
her
face
instantly
she
had
finished
his
voice
broke
forth
in
irrepressible
question
in
that
wonderful
space
of
time
he
had
learned
many
things
all
his
deductions
all
his
apprehensions
had
been
scattered
and
disproved
he
had
seen
the
true
meaning
of
lillian
astrupp
amused
indifference
the
indifference
of
a
variable
flippant
nature
that
robbed
of
any
real
weapon
for
mischief
soon
tires
of
a
game
that
promises
to
be
too
arduous
he
saw
all
this
and
understood
it
with
a
rapidity
born
of
the
moment
nevertheless
when
eve
ceased
to
speak
the
question
that
broke
from
him
was
not
connected
with
this
great
discovery
was
not
even
suggestive
of
it
it
was
something
quite
immaterial
to
any
real
issue
but
something
that
overshadowed
every
consideration
in
the
world
eve
he
said
tell
me
your
first
thought
your
first
thought
after
the
shock
and
the
surprise
when
you
remembered
me
there
was
a
fresh
pause
but
one
of
very
short
duration
then
eve
met
his
glance
fearlessly
and
frankly
the
same
pride
and
dignity
the
same
indescribable
tenderness
that
had
responded
to
his
first
appeal
shone
in
her
face
my
first
thought
was
a
great
thankfulness
she
said
simply
a
thankfulness
that
you
that
no
man
could
ever
xxxii
as
she
finished
speaking
eve
did
not
lower
her
eyes
to
her
there
was
no
suggestion
of
shame
in
her
thoughts
or
her
words
but
to
loder
watching
and
listening
there
was
a
perilous
meaning
contained
in
both
thankfulness
he
repeated
slowly
from
his
newly
stirred
sense
of
responsibility
pity
and
sympathy
were
gradually
rising
he
had
never
seen
eve
as
he
saw
her
now
and
his
vision
was
all
the
clearer
for
the
long
oblivion
with
a
poignant
sense
of
compassion
and
remorse
the
knowledge
of
her
youth
came
to
him
the
youth
that
some
women
preserve
in
the
midst
of
the
world
when
circumstances
have
permitted
them
to
see
much
but
to
experience
little
thankfulness
he
said
again
incredulously
a
slight
smile
touched
her
lips
yes
she
answered
softly
thankfulness
that
my
trust
had
been
rightly
she
spoke
simply
and
confidently
but
the
words
struck
loder
more
sharply
than
any
accusation
with
a
heavy
sense
of
bitterness
and
renunciation
he
moved
slowly
forward
eve
he
said
very
gently
you
do
know
what
you
she
had
lowered
her
eyes
as
he
came
towards
her
now
again
she
lifted
them
in
a
swift
upward
glance
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
entered
the
room
a
slight
look
of
personal
doubt
and
uneasiness
showed
in
her
face
why
she
said
i
i
do
for
a
moment
he
answered
nothing
he
had
found
his
first
explanation
overwhelming
now
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
present
difficulty
was
more
impossible
to
surmount
i
came
here
to
tell
you
something
he
began
at
last
but
so
far
i
have
only
said
half
half
yes
he
repeated
the
word
quickly
avoiding
the
question
in
her
eyes
then
conscious
of
the
need
for
explanation
he
plunged
into
rapid
speech
a
fraud
like
mine
he
said
has
only
one
safeguard
one
justification
a
boundless
audacity
once
shake
that
audacity
and
the
whole
motive
power
crumbles
it
was
to
make
the
audacity
impossible
to
tell
you
the
truth
and
make
it
impossible
that
i
came
the
fact
that
you
already
knew
made
the
telling
easier
but
it
altered
eve
raised
her
head
but
he
went
resolutely
on
he
said
i
have
seen
into
my
own
life
into
my
own
mind
and
my
ideas
have
been
very
roughly
shaken
into
new
places
we
never
make
so
colossal
a
mistake
as
when
we
imagine
that
we
know
ourselves
months
ago
when
your
husband
first
proposed
this
scheme
to
me
i
was
according
to
my
own
conception
a
solitary
being
vastly
by
fate
who
with
a
fine
stoicism
was
leading
a
clean
life
that
was
what
i
believed
but
there
at
the
very
outset
i
deceived
myself
i
was
simply
a
man
who
shut
himself
up
because
he
cherished
a
grudge
against
life
and
who
lived
honestly
because
he
had
a
constitutional
distaste
for
vice
my
first
feeling
when
i
saw
your
husband
was
one
of
contempt
and
that
has
been
my
attitude
all
along
i
have
often
marvelled
at
the
flood
of
intolerance
that
has
rushed
over
me
at
sight
of
him
the
violent
desire
that
has
possessed
me
to
look
away
from
his
weakness
and
banish
the
knowledge
of
it
but
now
i
understand
i
know
now
what
the
feeling
meant
the
knowledge
came
to
me
it
meant
that
i
turned
away
from
his
weakness
because
deep
within
myself
something
stirred
in
recognition
of
it
humanity
is
really
much
simpler
than
we
like
to
think
and
human
impulses
have
an
extraordinary
fundamental
connection
weakness
is
egotism
but
so
is
strength
chilcote
has
followed
his
vice
i
have
followed
my
ambition
it
will
take
a
higher
judgment
than
yours
or
mine
to
say
which
of
us
has
been
the
more
selfish
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
she
was
watching
him
intently
some
of
the
meaning
in
his
face
had
found
a
pained
alarmed
reflection
in
her
own
but
the
awe
and
wonder
of
the
morning
discovery
still
colored
her
mind
too
vividly
to
allow
of
other
considerations
possessing
their
proper
value
the
thrill
of
exultation
with
which
the
misgivings
born
of
chilcote
vice
had
dropped
away
from
her
mental
image
of
loder
was
still
too
absorbing
to
be
easily
dominated
she
loved
and
as
if
by
a
miracle
her
love
had
been
justified
for
the
moment
the
justification
was
something
of
confidence
something
of
the
innocence
that
comes
not
from
ignorance
of
evil
but
from
a
mind
singularly
uncontaminated
blinded
her
to
the
danger
of
her
position
loder
waiting
apprehensively
for
some
aid
some
expression
of
opinion
became
gradually
conscious
of
this
lack
of
realization
moved
by
a
fresh
impulse
he
crossed
the
small
space
that
divided
them
and
caught
her
hands
eve
he
said
gently
i
have
been
trying
to
analyze
myself
and
give
you
the
results
but
i
try
any
more
i
shall
be
quite
plain
with
you
from
the
first
moment
i
took
your
husband
place
i
was
ambitious
you
unconsciously
aroused
the
feeling
when
you
brought
me
fraide
message
on
the
first
night
you
aroused
it
by
your
words
but
more
strongly
though
more
obscurely
by
your
underlying
antagonism
on
that
night
though
i
did
not
know
it
i
took
up
my
position
i
made
my
determination
do
you
know
what
that
determination
was
she
shook
her
head
it
was
the
desire
to
stamp
out
chilcote
footmarks
with
my
own
to
prove
that
personality
is
the
great
force
capable
of
everything
i
forgot
to
reckon
that
when
we
draw
largely
upon
fate
she
generally
extorts
a
crushing
interest
first
came
the
wish
for
your
respect
then
the
desire
to
stand
well
with
such
men
as
fraide
to
feel
the
stir
of
emulation
and
competition
to
prove
myself
strong
in
the
one
career
i
knew
myself
really
fitted
for
for
a
time
the
second
ambition
overshadowed
the
first
but
the
first
was
bound
to
reassert
itself
and
in
a
moment
of
egotism
i
conceived
the
notion
of
winning
your
enthusiasm
as
well
as
your
respect
eve
face
alert
and
questioning
suddenly
paled
as
a
doubt
crossed
her
mind
then
it
was
only
only
to
stand
well
with
me
i
believed
it
was
only
the
desire
to
stand
well
with
you
i
believed
it
until
the
night
of
my
speech
if
you
can
credit
anything
so
absurd
then
on
that
night
as
i
came
up
the
stairs
to
the
gallery
and
saw
you
standing
there
the
blindness
fell
away
and
i
knew
that
i
loved
as
he
said
the
last
words
he
released
her
hands
and
turned
aside
missing
the
quick
wave
of
joy
and
color
that
crossed
her
face
i
knew
it
but
it
made
no
difference
i
was
only
moved
to
a
higher
i
touched
supremacy
that
night
but
as
we
drove
home
i
experienced
the
strangest
coincidence
of
my
life
you
remember
the
block
in
the
traffic
at
piccadilly
again
eve
bent
her
head
well
when
i
looked
out
of
the
carriage
window
to
discover
its
cause
the
first
man
i
saw
was
eve
started
slightly
this
swift
unexpected
linking
of
chilcote
name
with
the
most
exalted
moment
of
her
life
stirred
her
unpleasantly
some
glimmering
of
loder
intention
in
so
linking
it
broke
through
the
web
of
disturbed
and
conflicting
thoughts
you
saw
him
on
that
night
yes
and
the
sight
chilled
me
it
was
a
big
drop
from
supremacy
to
the
remembrance
of
involuntarily
she
put
out
her
hand
but
loder
shook
his
head
no
he
said
do
pity
me
the
sight
of
him
came
just
in
time
i
had
a
reaction
in
that
moment
and
such
as
it
was
i
acted
on
it
i
went
to
him
next
morning
and
told
him
that
the
thing
must
end
but
then
even
then
i
shirked
being
honest
with
myself
i
had
meant
to
tell
him
that
it
must
end
because
i
had
grown
to
love
you
but
my
pride
rose
up
and
tied
my
tongue
i
could
not
humiliate
myself
i
put
the
case
before
him
in
another
light
it
was
a
tussle
of
wills
and
i
won
but
the
victory
was
not
what
it
should
have
been
that
was
proved
when
he
returned
to
tell
me
of
the
loss
of
this
telegram
it
was
the
fear
that
lady
astrupp
had
found
it
it
to
save
the
position
that
i
jumped
at
the
chance
of
coming
back
it
was
to
feel
the
joy
of
living
the
joy
of
seeing
you
if
only
for
a
day
for
one
second
he
turned
towards
her
then
as
abruptly
he
turned
away
again
i
was
still
thinking
of
myself
he
said
i
was
still
utterly
when
i
came
to
this
room
today
and
allowed
you
to
talk
to
me
when
i
asked
you
to
see
me
as
we
parted
at
the
club
i
tell
you
the
thoughts
that
unconsciously
were
in
my
mind
when
i
asked
that
favor
you
must
understand
without
explanation
i
went
to
the
theatre
with
lady
astrupp
ostensibly
to
find
out
how
the
land
lay
in
her
direction
really
to
heighten
my
but
there
fate
or
the
power
we
like
to
call
by
that
name
was
lying
in
wait
for
me
ready
to
claim
the
first
interest
in
the
portion
of
life
i
had
dared
to
he
said
this
slowly
as
if
measuring
each
word
he
did
not
glance
towards
eve
as
he
had
done
in
his
previous
pause
his
whole
manner
seemed
oppressed
by
the
gravity
of
what
he
had
still
to
say
i
doubt
if
a
man
has
ever
seen
more
in
half
an
hour
than
i
have
he
said
i
speaking
of
mental
seeing
of
course
in
this
play
men
shoes
two
men
change
identities
as
chilcote
and
i
have
done
but
in
doing
so
they
overlook
one
fact
the
fact
that
one
of
them
has
a
wife
that
not
my
way
of
putting
it
it
the
way
it
was
put
to
me
by
one
of
lady
astrupp
again
eve
looked
up
the
doubt
and
question
in
her
eyes
had
grown
unmistakably
as
he
ceased
to
speak
her
lips
parted
quickly
john
she
said
with
sudden
conviction
you
trying
to
say
something
something
that
terribly
without
raising
his
head
loder
answered
her
yes
he
answered
the
hardest
thing
a
man
ever
said
his
tone
was
short
almost
brusque
but
to
ears
sharpened
by
instinct
it
was
eloquent
without
a
word
eve
took
a
step
forward
and
standing
quite
close
to
him
laid
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
for
a
space
they
stood
silent
she
with
her
face
lifted
he
with
averted
eyes
then
very
gently
he
raised
his
hands
and
tried
to
unclasp
her
fingers
there
was
scarcely
any
color
visible
in
his
face
and
by
a
curious
effect
of
emotion
it
seemed
that
lines
never
before
noticeable
had
formed
about
his
mouth
what
is
it
eve
asked
apprehensively
what
is
it
by
a
swift
involuntary
movement
she
had
tightened
the
pressure
of
her
fingers
and
without
using
force
it
was
impossible
for
loder
to
unloose
them
with
his
hands
pressed
irresolutely
over
hers
he
looked
down
into
her
face
as
i
sat
in
the
theatre
eve
he
said
slowly
all
the
pictures
i
had
formed
of
life
shifted
without
desiring
it
without
knowing
it
my
whole
point
of
view
was
changed
i
suddenly
saw
things
by
the
world
instead
of
by
my
own
miserable
candle
i
suddenly
saw
things
for
you
instead
of
for
eve
eyes
widened
and
darkened
but
she
said
nothing
i
suddenly
saw
the
unpardonable
wrong
that
i
have
done
you
the
imperative
duty
of
cutting
it
he
spoke
very
slowly
in
a
dull
mechanical
voice
eve
her
eyes
still
wide
her
face
pained
and
alarmed
withdrew
her
hands
from
his
shoulders
you
mean
she
said
with
difficulty
that
it
is
going
to
end
that
you
are
going
away
that
you
are
giving
everything
up
oh
but
you
ca
you
ca
she
exclaimed
with
sudden
excitement
her
fears
suddenly
overmastering
her
incredulity
you
ca
you
must
the
only
proof
that
could
have
interfered
i
was
thinking
of
the
then
of
what
of
what
loder
was
silent
for
a
moment
of
our
love
he
said
steadily
she
colored
deeply
but
why
she
stammered
why
we
have
done
no
wrong
we
need
do
no
wrong
we
would
be
friends
nothing
more
and
i
oh
i
so
need
a
friend
for
almost
the
first
time
in
loder
knowledge
of
her
her
voice
broke
her
control
deserted
her
she
stood
before
him
in
all
the
pathos
of
her
lonely
girlhood
her
empty
life
the
revelation
touched
him
with
sudden
poignancy
the
real
strength
that
lay
beneath
his
faults
the
chivalry
buried
under
years
of
callousness
stirred
at
the
birth
of
a
new
emotion
the
resolution
preserved
at
such
a
cost
the
sacrifice
that
had
seemed
wellnigh
impossible
all
at
once
took
on
a
different
shape
what
before
had
been
a
barren
duty
became
suddenly
a
sacred
right
holding
out
his
arms
he
drew
her
to
him
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
eve
he
said
gently
i
have
learned
how
fully
a
life
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
world
and
how
scanty
that
mercy
is
if
circumstances
had
been
different
i
believe
i
am
convinced
i
would
have
made
you
a
good
husband
would
have
used
my
right
to
protect
you
as
well
as
a
man
could
use
it
and
now
that
things
are
different
i
want
i
should
like
he
hesitated
a
very
little
now
that
i
have
no
right
to
protect
you
except
the
right
my
love
gives
i
want
to
guard
you
as
closely
from
all
that
is
sordid
as
any
husband
could
guard
his
wife
in
life
there
are
really
only
two
broad
issues
right
and
wrong
whatever
we
may
say
whatever
we
may
profess
to
believe
we
know
that
our
action
is
always
a
choice
between
right
and
wrong
a
month
ago
a
week
ago
i
would
have
despised
a
man
who
could
talk
like
this
and
have
thought
myself
strong
for
despising
him
now
i
know
that
strength
is
something
more
than
the
trampling
of
others
into
the
dust
that
we
ourselves
may
have
a
clear
road
that
it
is
something
much
harder
and
much
less
triumphant
than
that
that
it
is
standing
aside
to
let
somebody
else
pass
on
eve
he
exclaimed
suddenly
i
trying
to
do
this
for
you
do
you
see
do
you
understand
the
easy
course
the
happy
course
would
be
to
let
things
drift
every
instinct
is
calling
to
me
to
take
that
course
to
go
on
as
i
have
gone
trading
on
weakness
and
your
generosity
but
i
wo
do
it
i
ca
do
it
with
a
swift
impulse
he
loosed
his
arms
and
held
her
away
from
him
eve
the
first
time
i
have
put
another
human
being
before
myself
eve
kept
her
head
bent
painful
inaudible
sobs
were
shaking
her
from
head
to
foot
it
something
in
you
something
unconscious
something
high
and
fine
that
holds
me
back
that
literally
bars
the
way
eve
ca
you
see
that
i
fighting
fighting
hard
after
he
had
spoken
there
was
silence
a
long
painful
silence
during
which
eve
waged
the
battle
that
so
many
of
her
sex
have
waged
before
the
battle
in
which
words
are
useless
and
tears
of
no
account
she
looked
very
slight
very
young
very
forlorn
as
she
stood
there
then
in
the
oppressive
sense
of
waiting
that
filled
the
whole
room
she
looked
up
at
him
her
face
was
stained
with
tears
her
thick
black
lashes
were
still
wet
with
them
but
her
expression
as
her
eyes
met
loder
was
a
strange
example
of
the
courage
the
firmness
the
power
of
sacrifice
that
may
be
hidden
in
a
fragile
vessel
she
said
nothing
for
in
such
a
moment
words
do
not
come
easily
but
with
the
simplest
most
submissive
most
eloquent
gesture
in
the
world
she
set
his
perplexity
to
rest
taking
his
hand
between
hers
she
lifted
it
and
for
a
long
silent
space
held
it
against
her
lips
xxxiii
for
a
while
there
was
silence
then
loder
bitterly
aware
that
he
had
conquered
poignantly
conscious
of
the
appeal
that
eve
attitude
made
found
further
endurance
impossible
gently
freeing
his
hand
he
moved
away
from
her
to
the
fireplace
taking
up
the
position
that
she
had
first
occupied
eve
he
said
slowly
i
have
finished
yet
i
have
said
everything
i
going
to
tax
your
courage
with
a
touch
of
pained
alarm
eve
lifted
her
head
further
she
said
loder
shrank
from
the
expression
on
her
face
yes
he
said
with
difficulty
there
still
another
point
to
be
faced
the
matter
end
with
my
going
back
to
have
the
situation
fully
saved
chilcote
must
return
chilcote
must
be
brought
to
realize
his
eve
lips
parted
in
dumb
dismay
it
must
be
done
he
went
on
hurriedly
and
we
have
got
to
do
it
you
and
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
i
i
could
do
nothing
what
could
i
do
her
voice
failed
everything
he
said
you
could
do
everything
he
is
morally
weak
but
he
has
one
sensitive
point
the
fear
of
a
public
exposure
once
make
it
plain
to
him
that
you
know
his
secret
and
you
can
compel
him
to
whatever
course
of
action
you
select
it
was
to
ask
you
to
do
this
to
beg
you
to
do
this
that
i
came
to
you
i
know
that
demanding
more
than
a
woman
resolution
more
than
a
woman
strength
but
you
are
like
no
woman
in
the
world
eve
he
cried
with
sudden
vehemence
ca
you
see
that
imperative
the
one
thing
to
save
us
both
he
stopped
abruptly
as
he
had
begun
and
again
a
painful
silence
filled
the
room
then
as
before
eve
moved
instinctively
towards
him
but
this
time
her
steps
were
slow
and
uncertain
nearing
his
side
she
put
out
her
hand
as
if
for
comfort
and
support
and
feeling
his
fingers
tighten
round
it
stood
for
a
moment
resting
in
the
contact
i
understand
she
said
at
last
very
slowly
i
understand
when
will
you
take
me
to
him
for
a
moment
loder
said
nothing
not
daring
to
trust
his
voice
then
he
answered
low
and
abruptly
now
he
said
now
at
once
now
this
moment
if
i
may
and
and
remember
that
i
know
what
it
costs
as
if
imbued
with
fear
that
his
courage
might
fail
him
he
suddenly
released
her
hand
and
crossing
the
room
to
where
a
long
dark
cloak
lay
as
she
had
thrown
it
on
her
return
home
he
picked
it
up
walked
to
her
side
and
silently
wrapped
it
about
her
then
still
acting
automatically
he
moved
to
the
door
opened
it
and
stood
aside
while
she
passed
out
into
the
corridor
in
complete
silence
they
descended
the
stairs
and
passed
to
the
hall
door
there
crapham
who
had
returned
to
his
duties
since
entrance
came
quickly
forward
with
an
offer
of
service
but
loder
dismissed
him
curtly
and
with
something
of
the
confusion
bred
of
chilcote
regime
the
man
drew
back
towards
the
staircase
with
a
hasty
movement
loder
stepped
forward
and
opening
the
door
admitted
a
breath
of
chill
air
then
on
the
threshold
he
paused
it
was
his
first
sign
of
hesitation
the
one
instant
in
which
nature
rebelled
against
the
conscience
so
tardily
awakened
he
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
even
eve
fully
fathomed
the
bitterness
of
his
renunciation
the
blackness
of
the
night
that
stretched
before
his
eyes
behind
him
was
everything
before
him
nothing
the
everything
symbolized
by
the
luxurious
house
the
eagerly
attentive
servants
the
pleasant
atmosphere
of
responsibility
the
nothing
represented
by
the
broad
public
thoroughfare
the
passing
figures
each
unconscious
of
and
uninterested
in
his
existence
as
an
interloper
he
had
entered
this
house
as
an
interloper
a
masquerader
he
had
played
his
part
lived
his
hour
proved
himself
as
an
interloper
he
was
now
passing
back
into
the
dim
world
of
unrealized
hopes
and
unachieved
ambitions
he
stood
rigidly
quiet
his
strong
figure
silhouetted
against
the
lighted
hall
his
face
cold
and
set
then
with
a
touch
of
fatality
chance
cut
short
his
struggle
an
empty
hansom
wheeled
round
the
corner
of
the
square
the
cabman
seeing
him
raised
his
whip
in
query
and
involuntarily
he
nodded
an
acquiescence
a
moment
later
he
had
helped
eve
into
the
cab
middle
temple
lane
he
directed
pausing
on
the
step
middle
temple
lane
is
opposite
to
clifford
inn
he
explained
as
he
took
his
place
beside
her
when
we
get
out
there
we
have
only
to
cross
fleet
eve
bent
her
head
in
token
that
she
understood
and
the
cab
moved
out
into
the
roadway
within
a
few
minutes
the
neighborhood
of
grosvenor
square
was
exchanged
for
the
noisier
and
more
crowded
one
of
piccadilly
but
either
the
cabman
was
overcautious
or
the
horse
was
below
the
average
for
they
made
but
slow
progress
through
the
more
crowded
streets
to
the
two
sitting
in
silence
the
pace
was
wellnigh
unbearable
with
every
added
movement
the
tension
grew
the
methodical
care
with
which
they
moved
seemed
like
the
tightening
of
a
string
already
strained
to
yet
neither
spoke
because
neither
had
the
courage
necessary
for
words
once
or
twice
as
they
traversed
the
strand
loder
made
a
movement
as
if
to
break
the
silence
but
nothing
followed
it
he
continued
to
lean
forward
with
a
certain
dogged
stiffness
his
clasped
hands
resting
on
the
doors
of
the
cab
his
eyes
staring
straight
ahead
not
once
as
they
threaded
their
way
did
he
dare
to
glance
at
eve
though
every
movement
every
stir
of
her
garments
was
forced
upon
his
consciousness
by
his
acutely
awakened
senses
when
at
last
they
drew
up
before
the
dark
archway
of
middle
temple
lane
he
descended
hastily
and
as
he
mechanically
turned
to
protect
dress
from
the
wheel
he
looked
at
her
fully
for
the
first
time
since
their
enterprise
had
been
undertaken
as
he
looked
he
felt
his
heart
sink
he
had
expected
to
see
the
marks
of
suffering
on
her
face
but
the
expression
he
saw
suggested
something
more
than
mere
mental
pain
all
the
rich
color
that
usually
deepened
and
softened
the
charm
of
her
beauty
had
been
erased
as
if
by
a
long
illness
and
against
the
new
pallor
of
her
skin
her
blue
eyes
her
black
hair
and
eyebrows
seemed
startlingly
dark
a
chill
colder
than
remorse
a
chill
that
bordered
upon
actual
fear
touched
loder
in
that
moment
with
the
first
impulsive
gesture
he
had
allowed
himself
he
touched
her
arm
eve
he
began
unsteadily
then
the
word
died
off
his
lips
without
a
sound
almost
without
a
movement
she
returned
his
glance
and
something
in
her
eyes
checked
what
he
might
have
said
in
that
one
expressive
look
he
understood
all
she
had
desired
all
she
had
renounced
the
full
extent
of
the
ordeal
she
had
consented
to
and
the
motive
that
had
compelled
her
consent
he
drew
back
with
the
heavy
sense
that
repentance
and
pity
were
equally
futile
equally
out
of
place
still
in
silence
she
stepped
to
the
pavement
and
stood
aside
while
loder
dismissed
the
cab
to
both
there
was
something
symbolic
something
prophetic
in
the
dismissal
without
intention
and
almost
unconsciously
they
drew
closer
together
as
the
horse
turned
its
hoofs
clattering
on
the
roadway
its
harness
jingling
and
still
without
realization
they
looked
after
the
vehicle
as
it
moved
away
down
the
long
shadowed
thoroughfare
towards
the
lights
and
the
crowds
that
they
had
left
at
last
involuntarily
they
turned
towards
each
other
come
loder
said
abruptly
it
only
across
the
fleet
street
is
generally
very
quiet
once
midnight
is
passed
and
eve
had
no
need
of
guidance
or
protection
as
they
crossed
the
pavement
shining
like
ice
in
the
lamplight
they
crossed
it
slowly
walking
apart
for
the
dread
of
physical
contact
that
had
possessed
them
in
the
cab
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
them
again
inquisitiveness
has
little
place
in
the
region
of
the
city
and
they
gained
the
opposite
footpath
unnoticed
by
the
casual
then
still
holding
apart
they
reached
and
entered
clifford
inn
inside
the
entrance
they
paused
and
eve
shivered
involuntarily
how
gray
it
is
she
said
faintly
and
how
cold
like
a
loder
turned
to
her
far
one
moment
control
seemed
shaken
his
blood
surged
his
vision
clouded
the
sense
that
life
and
love
were
still
within
his
reach
filled
him
overwhelmingly
he
turned
towards
eve
he
half
extended
his
hands
then
stirred
by
what
impulse
moved
by
what
instinct
it
was
impossible
to
say
he
let
them
drop
to
his
sides
again
come
he
said
come
this
is
the
way
keep
close
to
me
put
your
hand
on
my
he
spoke
quietly
but
his
eyes
were
resolutely
averted
from
her
face
as
they
crossed
the
dim
silent
court
entering
the
gloomy
that
led
to
his
own
rooms
he
felt
her
fingers
tremble
on
his
arm
then
tighten
in
their
pressure
as
the
bare
passage
and
cheerless
stairs
met
her
view
but
he
set
his
lips
come
he
repeated
in
the
same
strained
voice
come
it
far
three
or
four
with
a
white
face
and
a
curious
expression
in
her
eyes
eve
moved
forward
she
had
released
loder
arm
as
they
crossed
the
hall
and
now
reaching
the
stairs
she
put
out
her
hand
gropingly
and
caught
the
banister
she
had
a
pained
numb
sense
of
submission
of
suffering
that
had
sunk
to
apathy
moving
forward
without
resistance
she
began
to
mount
the
stairs
the
ascent
was
made
in
silence
loder
went
first
his
shoulders
braced
his
head
held
erect
eve
mechanically
watchful
of
all
his
movements
followed
a
step
or
two
behind
with
weary
monotony
one
flight
of
stairs
succeeded
another
each
to
her
unaccustomed
eyes
seeming
more
colorless
more
solitary
more
desolate
than
the
preceding
one
then
at
last
with
a
sinking
sense
of
apprehension
she
realized
that
their
goal
was
reached
the
knowledge
broke
sharply
through
her
dulled
senses
and
confronted
by
the
closeness
of
her
ordeal
she
paused
her
head
lifted
her
hand
still
nervously
grasping
the
banister
her
lips
parted
as
if
in
sudden
demand
for
aid
but
in
the
nervous
expectation
the
pained
apprehension
of
the
moment
no
sound
escaped
them
loder
resolutely
crossing
the
landing
knew
nothing
of
the
silent
appeal
for
a
second
she
stood
hesitating
then
her
own
weakness
her
own
shrinking
dismay
were
submerged
in
the
interest
of
his
movements
slowly
mounting
the
remaining
steps
she
followed
him
as
if
fascinated
towards
the
door
that
showed
dingily
conspicuous
in
the
light
of
an
unshaded
almost
at
the
moment
that
she
reached
his
side
he
extended
his
hand
towards
the
door
the
action
was
decisive
and
hurried
as
though
he
feared
to
trust
himself
for
a
space
he
fumbled
with
the
lock
and
eve
standing
close
behind
him
heard
the
handle
creak
and
turn
under
his
pressure
then
he
shook
the
door
at
last
slowly
almost
reluctantly
he
turned
round
i
afraid
things
are
quite
quite
right
he
said
in
a
low
voice
the
door
is
locked
and
i
can
see
no
she
raised
her
eyes
quickly
but
you
have
a
key
she
whispered
have
you
got
a
key
it
was
obvious
that
to
both
the
unexpected
check
to
their
designs
was
fraught
with
danger
yes
but
he
looked
towards
the
door
yes
i
have
a
key
yes
right
he
added
quickly
i
use
it
wait
while
i
go
filled
with
a
new
nervousness
oppressed
by
the
loneliness
the
silence
about
her
eve
drew
back
obediently
the
sense
of
mystery
conveyed
by
the
closed
door
weighed
upon
her
her
susceptibilities
were
tensely
alert
as
she
watched
loder
search
for
his
key
and
insert
it
in
the
lock
with
mingled
dread
and
curiosity
she
saw
the
door
yield
and
gape
open
like
a
black
gash
in
the
dingy
wall
and
with
a
sudden
sense
of
desertion
she
saw
him
pass
through
the
aperture
and
heard
him
strike
a
match
the
wait
that
followed
seemed
extraordinarily
long
listening
intently
she
heard
him
move
softly
from
one
room
to
the
other
and
at
last
to
her
acutely
nervous
susceptibilities
it
seemed
that
he
paused
in
absolute
silence
in
the
intensity
of
listening
she
heard
her
own
faint
irregular
breathing
and
the
sound
filled
her
with
panic
the
quiet
the
solitude
the
vague
instinctive
apprehension
became
suddenly
unendurable
then
all
at
once
the
tension
was
loder
reappeared
he
paused
for
a
second
in
the
shadowy
then
he
turned
unsteadily
drew
the
door
to
and
locked
it
eve
stepped
forward
her
glimpse
of
him
had
been
momentary
and
she
had
not
heard
his
voice
yet
the
consciousness
of
his
bearing
filled
her
with
instinctive
alarm
abruptly
and
without
reason
their
hands
turned
cold
her
heart
began
to
beat
violently
john
she
said
below
her
breath
for
answer
he
moved
towards
her
his
face
was
bereft
of
color
there
was
a
look
of
consternation
in
his
eyes
come
he
said
come
at
once
i
must
take
you
he
spoke
in
a
shaken
uneven
voice
eve
looking
up
at
him
caught
his
hand
why
why
she
questioned
her
tone
was
low
and
scared
without
replying
he
drew
her
imperatively
towards
the
stairs
go
very
softly
he
commanded
no
one
must
see
you
in
the
first
moment
she
obeyed
him
instinctively
then
reaching
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
stopped
with
one
hand
still
clasping
his
the
other
clinging
nervously
to
the
banister
she
refused
to
descend
john
she
whispered
i
not
a
child
what
is
it
what
has
happened
i
must
for
a
moment
loder
looked
at
her
uncertainly
then
reading
the
expression
in
her
eyes
he
yielded
to
her
demand
he
dead
he
said
in
a
very
low
voice
chilcote
is
xxxiv
to
fully
appreciate
a
great
announcement
we
must
have
time
at
our
disposal
at
the
moment
of
loder
disclosure
time
was
denied
to
eve
for
scarcely
had
the
words
left
his
lips
before
the
thought
that
dominated
him
asserted
its
prior
claim
blind
to
the
incredulity
in
her
eyes
he
drew
her
swiftly
forward
and
half
impelling
half
supporting
her
forced
her
to
descend
the
stairs
never
in
could
he
obliterate
the
remembrance
of
that
descent
fear
such
as
he
could
never
experience
in
his
own
concerns
possessed
him
one
desire
overrode
all
others
the
desire
that
eve
reputation
which
he
himself
had
so
nearly
imperilled
should
remain
unimperilled
in
the
shadow
of
that
urgent
duty
the
despair
of
the
past
hours
the
appalling
fact
so
lately
realized
the
future
with
its
possible
trials
became
dark
to
his
imagination
in
his
new
victory
over
self
the
question
of
her
protection
predominated
moving
under
this
compulsion
he
guided
her
hastily
and
silently
down
the
deserted
stairs
drawing
a
breath
of
deep
relief
as
one
after
another
the
landings
were
successively
passed
and
still
actuated
by
the
suppressed
need
of
haste
he
passed
through
the
that
they
had
entered
under
such
different
conditions
only
a
few
minutes
before
to
leave
the
quiet
court
to
gain
the
strand
to
hail
a
belated
hansom
was
the
work
of
a
moment
by
an
odd
contrivance
of
circumstance
the
luck
that
had
attended
every
phase
of
his
dual
life
was
again
exerted
in
his
behalf
no
one
had
noticed
their
entry
into
clifford
inn
no
one
was
moved
to
curiosity
by
their
exit
with
an
involuntary
thrill
of
feeling
he
gave
expression
to
his
relief
thank
god
it
over
he
said
as
a
cab
drew
up
you
do
know
what
the
strain
has
moving
as
if
in
a
dream
eve
stepped
into
the
cab
as
yet
the
terrible
denouement
to
their
enterprise
had
made
no
clear
impression
upon
her
mind
for
the
moment
all
that
she
was
conscious
of
all
that
she
instinctively
acknowledged
was
the
fact
that
loder
was
still
beside
her
in
quiet
obedience
she
took
her
place
drawing
aside
her
skirts
to
make
room
for
him
and
in
the
same
subdued
manner
he
stepped
into
the
vehicle
then
with
the
strange
sensation
of
reliving
their
earlier
drive
they
were
aware
of
the
tightened
rein
and
of
the
horse
first
forward
movement
for
several
seconds
neither
spoke
eve
shutting
out
all
other
thoughts
sat
close
to
loder
clinging
tenaciously
to
the
momentary
comforting
sense
of
protection
loder
striving
to
marshal
his
ideas
hesitated
before
the
ordeal
of
speech
at
last
realizing
his
responsibility
he
turned
to
her
slowly
eve
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
with
some
hesitation
i
want
you
to
know
that
in
all
this
from
the
moment
i
saw
him
from
the
moment
i
understood
i
have
had
you
in
my
thoughts
you
and
no
one
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
do
you
realize
he
began
afresh
do
you
know
what
this
this
thing
means
still
she
remained
silent
it
means
that
after
there
will
be
no
such
person
in
london
as
john
loder
the
man
who
was
known
by
that
name
will
be
found
in
his
rooms
his
body
will
be
removed
and
at
the
examination
it
will
be
stated
that
he
died
of
an
overdose
of
morphia
his
charwoman
will
identify
him
as
a
solitary
man
who
lived
respectably
for
years
and
then
suddenly
went
with
remarkable
speed
it
will
be
quite
a
common
case
nothing
of
interest
will
be
found
in
his
rooms
no
relation
will
claim
his
body
after
the
usual
time
he
will
be
given
the
usual
burial
of
his
class
these
details
are
horrible
but
there
are
times
when
we
must
look
at
the
horrible
side
of
life
because
life
is
incomplete
without
it
these
things
i
speak
of
are
the
things
that
will
meet
the
casual
eye
but
in
our
sight
they
will
have
a
very
different
meaning
eve
he
said
more
vehemently
a
whole
chapter
in
my
life
has
been
closed
and
my
first
instinct
is
to
shut
the
book
and
throw
it
away
but
i
thinking
of
you
remember
i
thinking
of
you
whatever
the
trial
whatever
the
difficulty
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
you
have
my
word
for
that
i
return
with
you
now
to
grosvenor
square
i
remain
there
till
a
reasonable
excuse
can
be
given
for
chilcote
going
abroad
i
will
avoid
fraide
i
will
cut
politics
whatever
the
cost
then
at
the
first
reasonable
moment
i
will
do
what
i
would
do
now
if
it
were
possible
i
go
away
start
afresh
do
in
another
country
what
i
have
done
in
there
was
a
long
silence
then
eve
turned
to
him
the
apathy
of
a
moment
before
had
left
her
face
in
another
country
she
repeated
in
another
country
yes
a
fresh
career
in
a
fresh
country
something
clean
to
offer
you
i
not
too
old
to
do
what
other
men
have
he
paused
and
for
a
moment
eve
looked
ahead
at
the
gleaming
chain
of
lamps
then
still
very
slowly
she
brought
her
glance
back
again
no
she
said
very
slowly
you
are
not
too
old
but
there
are
times
when
age
and
things
like
age
are
not
the
real
consideration
it
seems
to
me
that
your
own
inclination
your
own
individual
sense
of
right
and
wrong
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
moment
the
question
is
whether
you
are
justified
in
going
away
she
paused
her
eyes
fixed
steadily
upon
his
whether
you
are
free
to
go
away
and
make
a
new
life
whether
it
is
ever
justifiable
to
follow
a
phantom
light
when
when
there
a
lantern
waiting
to
be
her
breath
caught
she
drew
away
from
him
frightened
and
elated
by
her
own
words
loder
turned
to
her
sharply
eve
he
exclaimed
then
his
tone
changed
you
do
know
what
you
saying
he
added
quickly
you
understand
what
you
eve
leaned
forward
again
yes
she
said
slowly
i
do
her
voice
was
controlled
her
manner
convinced
she
was
no
longer
the
girl
conquered
by
strength
greater
than
her
own
she
was
the
woman
strenuously
demanding
her
right
to
individual
happiness
i
understand
it
all
she
repeated
i
understand
every
point
it
was
not
chance
that
made
you
change
your
identity
that
made
you
care
for
me
that
brought
about
his
death
i
do
believe
it
was
chance
i
believe
it
was
something
much
higher
you
are
not
meant
to
go
away
as
loder
watched
her
the
remembrance
of
his
first
days
as
chilcote
rose
again
the
remembrance
of
how
he
had
been
dimly
filled
with
the
belief
that
below
her
lay
a
strength
a
depth
uncommon
in
woman
as
he
studied
her
now
the
instinctive
belief
flamed
into
conviction
eve
he
said
involuntarily
with
a
quick
gesture
she
raised
her
head
no
she
exclaimed
no
do
say
anything
you
are
going
to
see
things
as
i
see
them
you
must
do
so
you
have
no
choice
no
real
man
ever
casts
away
the
substance
for
the
shadow
her
eyes
shone
the
color
the
glow
the
vitality
rushed
back
into
her
face
john
she
said
softly
i
love
you
and
i
need
you
but
there
is
something
with
a
greater
claim
a
greater
need
than
mine
do
you
know
what
it
is
he
said
nothing
he
made
no
gesture
it
is
the
party
the
country
you
may
put
love
aside
but
duty
is
different
you
have
pledged
yourself
you
are
not
meant
to
draw
loder
lips
parted
do
she
said
again
do
say
anything
i
know
all
that
is
in
your
mind
but
when
we
sift
things
right
through
it
is
my
love
or
our
happiness
that
really
in
the
balance
it
is
your
future
her
voice
thrilled
you
are
going
to
be
a
great
man
and
a
great
man
is
the
property
of
his
country
he
has
no
right
to
individual
again
loder
made
an
effort
to
speak
but
again
she
checked
him
wait
she
exclaimed
wait
you
believe
you
have
acted
wrongly
and
you
are
desperately
afraid
of
acting
wrongly
again
but
is
it
really
truer
more
loyal
for
us
to
work
out
a
long
probation
in
grooves
that
are
already
overfilled
than
to
marry
quietly
abroad
and
fill
the
places
that
have
need
of
us
that
is
the
question
i
want
you
to
answer
is
it
really
truer
and
nobler
oh
i
see
the
doubt
that
is
in
your
mind
you
think
it
finer
to
go
away
and
make
a
new
life
than
to
live
the
life
that
is
waiting
you
because
one
is
independent
and
the
other
means
the
use
of
another
man
name
and
another
man
money
that
is
the
thought
in
your
mind
but
what
is
it
that
prompts
that
thought
again
her
voice
caught
but
her
eyes
did
not
falter
i
will
tell
you
it
is
not
but
pride
she
said
the
word
fearlessly
a
flush
crossed
loder
face
a
man
requires
pride
he
said
in
a
low
voice
yes
at
the
right
time
but
is
this
the
right
time
is
it
ever
right
to
throw
away
the
substance
for
the
shadow
you
say
that
i
understand
do
realize
i
realize
more
than
i
have
realized
in
all
my
life
i
know
that
you
have
an
opportunity
that
can
never
come
again
and
that
it
terribly
possible
to
let
it
slip
she
paused
loder
his
hands
resting
on
the
closed
doors
of
the
cab
sat
very
silent
with
averted
eyes
and
bent
head
only
she
went
on
you
told
me
that
everything
was
crying
to
you
to
take
the
easy
pleasant
way
then
it
was
strong
to
turn
aside
but
now
it
is
not
strong
it
is
far
nobler
to
fill
an
empty
niche
than
to
carve
one
for
yourself
john
she
suddenly
leaned
forward
laying
her
hands
over
his
mr
fraide
told
me
that
in
his
new
ministry
my
my
husband
was
to
be
under
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
the
words
fell
softly
so
softly
that
to
ears
less
comprehending
than
loder
their
significance
might
have
been
lost
as
his
rigid
attitude
and
unresponsive
manner
might
have
conveyed
lack
of
understanding
to
any
eyes
less
observant
than
eve
for
a
long
space
there
was
no
word
spoken
at
last
with
a
very
gentle
pressure
her
fingers
tightened
over
his
hands
john
she
began
gently
but
the
word
died
away
she
drew
back
into
her
seat
as
the
cab
stopped
before
chilcote
house
simultaneously
as
they
descended
the
hall
door
was
opened
and
a
flood
of
warm
light
poured
out
reassuringly
into
the
darkness
i
thought
it
was
your
cab
sir
crapham
explained
deferentially
as
they
passed
into
the
hall
mr
fraide
has
been
waiting
to
see
you
this
i
showed
him
into
the
he
closed
the
door
softly
and
retired
then
in
the
warm
light
amid
the
gravely
dignified
surroundings
that
had
marked
his
first
entry
into
this
hazardous
second
existence
eve
turned
to
loder
for
the
verdict
upon
which
the
future
hung
as
she
turned
his
face
was
still
hidden
from
her
and
his
attitude
betrayed
nothing
john
she
said
slowly
you
know
why
he
is
here
you
know
that
he
has
come
to
personally
offer
you
this
place
to
personally
receive
your
refusal
or
she
ceased
to
speak
there
was
a
moment
of
suspense
then
loder
turned
his
face
was
still
pale
and
grave
with
the
gravity
of
a
man
who
has
but
recently
been
close
to
death
but
beneath
the
gravity
was
another
look
the
old
expression
of
strength
and
tempered
raised
and
dignified
by
a
new
humility
moving
forward
he
held
out
his
hands
my
consent
or
refusal
he
said
very
quietly
lies
with
my
wife
