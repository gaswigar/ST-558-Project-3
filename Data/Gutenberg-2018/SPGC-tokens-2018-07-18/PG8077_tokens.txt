this

not
a
treatise
on
the
most
important
of
all

of

concern
although
it
has
cost
its
author
a
great
deal
more
thought
and
labor
than
will
be
apparent
it
falls
in
his
estimation
far
below
the
demands
of
its
implacably
urgent

readily
be
expanded
into
a

suggests

on
the
purpose
of
this
volume
if
some
magical
transformation
could
be
produced
in
men
ways
of
looking
at
themselves
and
their
fellows
no
inconsiderable
part
of
the
evils
which
now
afflict
society
would
vanish
away
or
remedy
themselves
automatically
if
the
majority
of
influential
persons
held
the
opinions
and
occupied
the
point
of
view
that
a
few
rather
uninfluential
people
now
do
there
would
for
instance
be
no
likelihood
of
another
great

the
whole
problem
of
labor
and

would
be
transformed
and
attenuated
national
arrogance
race
animosity
political
corruption
and
inefficiency
would
all
be
reduced
below
the
danger
point
as
an
old
stoic
proverb
has
it
men
are
tormented
by
the
opinions
they
have
of
things
rather
than
by
the
things
themselves
this
is
eminently
true
of
many
of
our
worst
problems
we
have
available
knowledge
and
ingenuity
and
material
resources
to
make
a
far
fairer
world
than
that
in
which
we
find
ourselves
but
various
obstacles
prevent
our
intelligently
availing
ourselves
of
them
the
object
of
this
book
is
to
substantiate
this
proposition
to
exhibit
with
entire
frankness
the
tremendous
difficulties
that
stand
in
the
way
of
such
a
beneficent
change
of
mind
and
to
point
out
as
clearly
as
may
be
some
of
the
measures
to
be
taken
in
order
to
overcome
them
when
we
contemplate
the
shocking
derangement
of
human
affairs
which
now
prevails
in
most
civilized
countries
including
our
own
even
the
best
minds
are
puzzled
and
uncertain
in
their
attempts
to
grasp
the
situation
the
world
seems
to
demand
a
moral
and
economic
regeneration
which
it
is
dangerous
to
postpone
but
as
yet
impossible
to
imagine
let
alone
direct
the
preliminary
intellectual
regeneration
which
would
put
our
leaders
in
a
position
to
determine
and
control
the
course
of
affairs
has
not
taken
place
we
have
unprecedented
conditions
to
deal
with
and
novel
adjustments
to
make
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
we
also
have
a
great
stock
of
scientific
knowledge
unknown
to
our
grandfathers
with
which
to
operate
so
novel
are
the
conditions
so
copious
the
knowledge
that
we
must
undertake
the
arduous
task
of
reconsidering
a
great
part
of
the
opinions
about
man
and
his
relations
to
his
which
have
been
handed
down
to
us
by
previous
generations
who
lived
in
far
other
conditions
and
possessed
far
less
information
about
the
world
and
themselves
we
have
however
first
to
create
an
attitude
of
mind
to
cope
with
unprecedented
conditions
and
to
utilize
unprecedented
this
is
the
preliminary
and
most
difficult
step
to
be
taken
far
more
difficult
than
one
would
suspect
who
fails
to
realize
that
in
order
to
take
it
we
must
overcome
inveterate
natural
tendencies
and
artificial
habits
of
long
standing
how
are
we
to
put
ourselves
in
a
position
to
come
to
think
of
things
that
we
not
only
never
thought
of
before
but
are
most
reluctant
to
question
in
short
how
are
we
to
rid
ourselves
of
our
fond
prejudices
and
our
as
a
historical
student
who
for
a
good
many
years
has
been
especially
engaged
in
inquiring
how
man
happens
to
have
the
ideas
and
convictions
about
himself
and
human
relations
which
now
prevail
the
writer
has
reached
the
conclusion
that
history
can
at
least
shed
a
great
deal
of
light
on
our
present
predicaments
and
confusion
i
do
not
mean
by
history
that
conventional
chronicle
of
remote
and
irrelevant
events
which
embittered
the
youthful
years
of
many
of
us
but
rather
a
study
of
how
man
has
come
to
be
as
he
is
and
to
believe
as
he
does
no
historian
has
so
far
been
able
to
make
the
whole
story
very
plain
or
popular
but
a
number
of
considerations
are
obvious
enough
and
it
ought
not
to
be
impossible
some
day
to
popularize
them
i
venture
to
think
that
if
certain
seemingly
indisputable
historical
facts
were
generally
known
and
accepted
and
permitted
to
play
a
daily
part
in
our
thought
the
world
would
forthwith
become
a
very
different
place
from
what
it
now
is
we
could
then
neither
delude
ourselves
in
the
way
we
now
do
nor
could
we
take
advantage
of
the
primitive
ignorance
of
others
all
our
discussions
of
social
industrial
and
political
reform
would
be
raised
to
a
higher
plane
of
insight
and
fruitfulness
in
one
of
those
brilliant
divagations
with
which
wells
is
wont
to
enrich
his
novels
he
says
when
the
intellectual
history
of
this
time
comes
to
be
written
nothing
i
think
will
stand
out
more
strikingly
than
the
empty
gulf
in
quality
between
the
superb
and
richly
fruitful
scientific
investigations
that
are
going
on
and
the
general
thought
of
other
educated
sections
of
the
community
i
do
not
mean
that
scientific
men
are
as
a
whole
a
class
of
supermen
dealing
with
and
thinking
about
everything
in
a
way
altogether
better
than
the
common
run
of
humanity
but
in
their
field
they
think
and
work
with
an
intensity
an
integrity
a
breadth
boldness
patience
thoroughness
and
faithfulness
excepting
only
a
few
artists
which
puts
their
work
out
of
all
comparison
with
any
other
human
activity
in
these
particular
directions
the
human
mind
has
achieved
a
new
and
higher
quality
of
attitude
and
gesture
a
veracity
a
and
vigor
of
criticism
that
tend
to
spread
out
and
must
ultimately
spread
out
to
every
other
human
affair
no
one
who
is
even
most
superficially
acquainted
with
the
achievements
of
students
of
nature
during
the
past
few
centuries
can
fail
to
see
that
their
thought
has
been
astoundingly
effective
in
constantly
adding
to
our
knowledge
of
the
universe
from
the
hugest
nebula
to
the
tiniest
atom
moreover
this
knowledge
has
been
so
applied
as
to
revolutionize
human
affairs
and
both
the
knowledge
and
its
applications
appear
to
be
no
more
than
hopeful
beginnings
with
indefinite
revelations
ahead
if
only
the
same
kind
of
thought
be
continued
in
the
same
patient
and
scrupulous
manner
but
the
knowledge
of
man
of
the
springs
of
his
conduct
of
his
relation
to
his
singly
or
in
groups
and
the
felicitous
regulation
of
human
intercourse
in
the
interest
of
harmony
and
fairness
have
made
no
such
advance
aristotle
treatises
on
astronomy
and
physics
and
his
notions
of
generation
and
decay
and
of
chemical
processes
have
long
gone
by
the
board
but
his
politics
and
ethics
are
still
revered
does
this
mean
that
his
penetration
in
the
sciences
of
man
exceeded
so
greatly
his
grasp
of
natural
science
or
does
it
mean
that
the
progress
of
mankind
in
the
scientific
knowledge
and
regulation
of
human
affairs
has
remained
almost
stationary
for
over
two
thousand
years
i
think
that
we
may
safely
conclude
that
the
latter
is
the
case
it
has
required
three
centuries
of
scientific
thought
and
of
subtle
inventions
for
its
promotion
to
enable
a
modern
chemist
or
physicist
to
center
his
attention
on
electrons
and
their
relation
to
the
mysterious
nucleus
of
the
atom
or
to
permit
an
embryologist
to
study
the
early
stirrings
of
the
fertilized
egg
as
yet
relatively
little
of
the
same
kind
of
thought
has
been
brought
to
bear
on
human
affairs
when
we
compare
the
discussions
in
the
united
states
senate
in
regard
to
the
league
of
nations
with
the
consideration
of
a
car
in
a
roadside
garage
the
contrast
is
shocking
the
rural
mechanic
thinks
scientifically
his
only
aim
is
to
avail
himself
of
his
knowledge
of
the
nature
and
workings
of
the
car
with
a
view
to
making
it
run
once
more
the
senator
on
the
other
hand
appears
too
often
to
have
little
idea
of
the
nature
and
workings
of
nations
and
he
relies
on
rhetoric
and
appeals
to
vague
fears
and
hopes
or
mere
partisan
animosity
the
scientists
have
been
busy
for
a
century
in
revolutionizing
the
relation
of
nations
the
ocean
is
no
longer
a
barrier
as
it
was
in
washington
day
but
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
smooth
avenue
closely
connecting
rather
than
safely
separating
the
eastern
and
western
continents
the
senator
will
nevertheless
unblushingly
appeal
to
policies
of
a
century
back
suitable
mayhap
in
their
day
but
now
become
a
warning
rather
than
a
guide
the
garage
man
on
the
contrary
takes
his
mechanism
as
he
finds
it
and
does
not
allow
any
mystic
respect
for
the
earlier
forms
of
the
gas
engine
to
interfere
with
the
needed
adjustments
those
who
have
dealt
with
natural
phenomena
as
distinguished
from
purely
human
concerns
did
not
however
quickly
or
easily
gain
popular
approbation
and
respect
the
process
of
emancipating
natural
science
from
current
prejudices
both
of
the
learned
and
of
the
unlearned
has
been
long
and
painful
and
is
not
wholly
completed
yet
if
we
go
back
to
the
opening
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
find
three
men
whose
business
it
was
above
all
to
present
and
defend
common
sense
in
the
natural
sciences
the
most
eloquent
and
variedly
persuasive
of
these
was
lord
bacon
then
there
was
the
young
descartes
trying
to
shake
himself
loose
from
his
training
in
a
jesuit
seminary
by
going
into
the
thirty
years
war
and
starting
his
intellectual
life
all
over
by
giving
up
for
the
moment
all
he
had
been
taught
galileo
had
committed
an
offense
of
a
grave
character
by
discussing
in
the
mother
tongue
the
problems
of
physics
in
his
old
age
he
was
imprisoned
and
sentenced
to
repeat
the
seven
penitential
psalms
for
differing
from
aristotle
and
moses
and
the
teachings
of
the
theologians
on
hearing
galileo
fate
descartes
burned
a
book
he
had
written
the
lest
he
too
get
into
trouble
from
that
time
down
to
the
days
of
huxley
and
john
fiske
the
struggle
has
continued
and
still
continues
the
three
hundred
years
war
for
intellectual
freedom
in
dealing
with
natural
phenomena
it
has
been
a
conflict
against
ignorance
tradition
and
vested
interests
in
church
and
university
with
all
that
preposterous
invective
and
cruel
misrepresentation
which
characterize
the
fight
against
new
and
critical
ideas
those
who
cried
out
against
scientific
discoveries
did
so
in
the
name
of
god
of
man
dignity
and
of
holy
religion
and
morality
finally
however
it
has
come
about
that
our
instruction
in
the
natural
sciences
is
tolerably
free
although
there
are
still
large
bodies
of
organized
religious
believers
who
are
hotly
opposed
to
some
of
the
more
fundamental
findings
of
biology
hundreds
of
thousands
of
readers
can
be
found
for
pastor
russell
exegesis
of
ezekiel
and
the
apocalypse
to
hundreds
who
read
conklin
and
or
slosson
no
publisher
would
accept
a
historical
textbook
based
on
an
explicit
statement
of
the
knowledge
we
now
have
of
man
animal
ancestry
in
general
however
our
scientific
men
carry
on
their
work
and
report
their
results
with
little
or
no
effective
hostility
on
the
part
of
the
clergy
or
the
schools
the
social
body
has
become
tolerant
of
their
virus
this
is
not
the
case
however
with
the
social
sciences
one
can
not
but
feel
a
little
queasy
when
he
uses
the
expression
social
science
because
it
seems
as
if
we
had
not
as
yet
got
anywhere
near
a
real
science
of
man
i
mean
by
social
science
our
feeble
efforts
to
study
man
his
natural
equipment
and
impulses
and
his
relations
to
his
fellows
in
the
light
of
his
origin
and
the
history
of
the
race
this
enterprise
has
hitherto
been
opposed
by
a
large
number
of
obstacles
essentially
more
hampering
and
far
more
numerous
than
those
which
for
three
hundred
years
hindered
the
advance
of
the
natural
sciences
human
affairs
are
in
themselves
far
more
intricate
and
perplexing
than
molecules
and
chromosomes
but
this
is
only
the
more
reason
for
bringing
to
bear
on
human
affairs
that
critical
type
of
thought
and
calculation
for
which
the
remunerative
thought
about
molecules
and
chromosomes
has
prepared
the
way
i
do
not
for
a
moment
suggest
that
we
can
use
precisely
the
same
kind
of
thinking
in
dealing
with
the
quandaries
of
mankind
that
we
use
in
problems
of
chemical
reaction
and
mechanical
adjustment
exact
scientific
results
such
as
might
be
formulated
in
mechanics
are
of
course
out
of
the
question
it
would
be
unscientific
to
expect
to
apply
them
i
am
not
advocating
any
particular
method
of
treating
human
affairs
but
rather
such
a
frame
of
mind
such
a
critical
as
has
hitherto
been
but
sparsely
developed
among
those
who
aspire
to
be
men
guides
whether
religious
political
economic
or
academic
most
human
progress
has
been
as
wells
expresses
it
a
mere
muddling
through
it
has
been
man
wont
to
explain
and
sanctify
his
ways
with
little
regard
to
their
fundamental
and
permanent
expediency
an
arresting
example
of
what
this
muddling
may
mean
we
have
seen
during
these
recent
years
in
the
slaying
or
maiming
of
fifteen
million
of
our
young
men
resulting
in
incalculable
loss
continued
disorder
and
bewilderment
yet
men
seem
blindly
driven
to
defend
and
perpetuate
the
conditions
which
produced
the
last
disaster
unless
we
wish
to
see
a
recurrence
of
this
or
some
similar
calamity
we
must
as
i
have
already
suggested
create
a
new
and
unprecedented
attitude
of
mind
to
meet
the
new
and
unprecedented
conditions
which
confront
us
should
proceed
to
the
thorough
reconstruction
of
our
mind
with
a
view
to
understanding
actual
human
conduct
and
we
must
examine
the
facts
freshly
critically
and
dispassionately
and
then
allow
our
philosophy
to
formulate
itself
as
a
result
of
this
examination
instead
of
permitting
our
observations
to
be
distorted
by
archaic
philosophy
political
economy
and
ethics
as
it
is
we
are
taught
our
philosophy
first
and
in
its
light
we
try
to
justify
the
facts
we
must
reverse
this
process
as
did
those
who
began
the
great
work
in
experimental
science
we
must
first
face
the
facts
and
patiently
await
the
emergence
of
a
new
philosophy
a
willingness
to
examine
the
very
foundations
of
society
does
not
mean
a
desire
to
encourage
or
engage
in
any
hasty
readjustment
but
certainly
no
wise
or
needed
readjustment
be
made
unless
such
an
examination
is
undertaken
i
come
back
then
to
my
original
point
that
in
this
examination
of
existing
facts
history
by
revealing
the
origin
of
many
of
our
current
fundamental
beliefs
will
tend
to
free
our
minds
so
as
to
permit
honest
thinking
also
that
the
historical
facts
which
i
propose
to
recall
would
if
permitted
to
play
a
constant
part
in
our
thinking
automatically
eliminate
a
very
considerable
portion
of
the
gross
stupidity
and
blindness
which
characterize
our
present
thought
and
conduct
in
public
affairs
and
would
contribute
greatly
to
developing
the
needed
scientific
attitude
toward
human
concerns
in
other
words
to
the
mind
up
to
three
disappointed
methods
of
reform
plans
for
social
betterment
and
the
cure
of
public
ills
have
in
the
past
taken
three
general
forms
i
changes
in
the
rules

all

it
now
confessedly
is

many
reformers
concede
that
they
are
suspicious
of
what
they
call

they
are
confident
that
our
troubles
result
from
defective

by

and
wise
ordinances
abuses
should
be
abolished

ingenious

going
on

the
hope
of
reducing

increasing
efficiency
the
house
of
commons
not
long
ago
came
to
new
terms
with
the
peers
the
league
of
nations
has
already
had
to
adjust
the
functions
and
influence
of
the
council
and
the
assembly
respectively
no
one
will
question
that
organization
is
absolutely
essential
in
human
affairs
but
reorganization
while
it
sometimes
produces
assignable
benefit
often
fails
to
meet
existing
evils
and
not
uncommonly
engenders
new
and
unexpected
ones
our
confidence
in
restriction
and
regimentation
is
exaggerated
what
we
usually
need
is
a
of
and
without
this
our
new
regulations
often
leave
the
old
situation
unaltered
so
long
as
we
allow
our
government
to
be
run
by
politicians
and
business
lobbies
it
makes
little
difference
how
many
aldermen
or
assemblymen
we
have
or
how
long
the
mayor
or
governor
holds
office
in
a
university
the
fundamental
drift
of
affairs
can
not
be
greatly
modified
by
creating
a
new
dean
or
a
university
council
or
by
enhancing
or
decreasing
the
nominal
authority
of

now
turn
to
the
second
sanctified
method
of
reform
moral
uplift
ii
those
who
are
impatient
with
mere
administrative
reform
or
who
lack
faith
in
it
declare
that
what
we
need
is
brotherly
love
thousands
of
pulpits
admonish
us
to
remember
that
we
are
all
children
of
one
heavenly
father
and
that
we
should
bear
one
another
burdens
with
fraternal
patience
capital
is
too
selfish
labor
is
bent
on
its
own
narrow
interests
regardless
of
the
risks
capital
takes
we
are
all
dependent
on
one
another
and
a
recognition
of
this
should
beget
mutual
forbearance
and
glad
let
us
forget
ourselves
in
others
little
children
love
one
another
the
fatherhood
of
god
has
been
preached
by
christians
for
over
eighteen
centuries
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
by
the
stoics
long
before
them
the
doctrine
has
proved
compatible
with
slavery
and
serfdom
with
wars
blessed
and
not
infrequently
instigated
by
religious
leaders
and
with
industrial
oppression
which
it
requires
a
brave
clergyman
or
teacher
to
denounce
true
we
sometimes
have
moments
of
sympathy
when
our
become
objects
of
tender
solicitude
some
rare
souls
may
honestly
flatter
themselves
that
they
love
mankind
in
general
but
it
would
surely
be
a
very
rare
soul
indeed
who
dared
profess
that
he
loved
his
personal
enemies
much
less
the
enemies
of
his
country
or
institutions
we
still
worship
a
tribal
god
and
the
foe
is
not
to
be
reckoned
among
his
children
suspicion
and
hate
are
much
more
congenial
to
our
natures
than
love
for
very
obvious
reasons
in
this
world
of
rivalry
and
common
failure
there
is
beyond
doubt
a
natural
kindliness
in
mankind
which
will
show
itself
under
favorable
auspices
but
experience
would
seem
to
teach
that
it
is
little
promoted
by
moral
exhortation
this
is
the
only
point
that
need
be
urged
here
whether
there
is
another
way
of
forwarding
the
brotherhood
of
man
will
be
considered
in
the
sequel
iii
one
disappointed
in
the
effects
of
mere
reorganization
and
distrusting
the
power
of
moral
exhortation
will
urge
that
what
we
need
above
all
is
it
is
quite
true
that
what
we
need
is
education
but
something
so
different
from
what
now
passes
as
such
that
it
needs
a
new
name
education
has
more
various
aims
than
we
usually
recognize
and
should
of
course
be
judged
in
relation
to
the
importance
of
its
several
intentions
and
of
its
success
in
gaining
them
the
arts
of
reading
and
writing
and
figuring
all
would
concede
are
basal
in
a
world
of
newspapers
and
business
then
there
is
technical
information
and
the
training
that
prepares
one
to
earn
a
livelihood
in
some
more
or
less
standardized
guild
or
profession
both
these
aims
are
reached
fairly
well
by
our
present
educational
system
subject
to
various
economies
and
improvements
in
detail
then
there
are
the
studies
which
it
is
assumed
contribute
to
general
culture
and
to
training
the
mind
with
the
hope
of
cultivating
our
tastes
stimulating
the
imagination
and
mayhap
improving
our
reasoning
powers
this
branch
of
education
is
regarded
by
the
few
as
very
precious
and
indispensable
by
the
many
as
at
best
an
amenity
which
has
little
relation
to
the
real
purposes
and
success
of
life
it
is
highly
traditional
and
retrospective
in
the
main
concerned
with
ancient
tongues
old
and
revered
books
higher
mathematics
somewhat
archaic
philosophy
and
history
and
the
fruitless
form
of
logic
which
has
until
recently
been
prized
as
man
best
guide
in
the
fastnesses
of
error
to
these
has
been
added
in
recent
decades
a
choice
of
the
various
branches
of
natural
science
the
results
however
of
our
present
scheme
of
liberal
education
are
disappointing
one
who
like
myself
firmly
agrees
with
its
objects
and
is
personally
so
addicted
to
old
books
so
pleased
with
such
knowledge
as
he
has
of
the
ancient
and
modern
languages
so
envious
of
those
who
can
think
mathematically
and
so
interested
in
natural
science
such
a
person
must
resent
the
fact
that
those
who
have
had
a
liberal
education
rarely
care
for
old
books
rarely
read
for
pleasure
any
foreign
language
think
mathematically
love
philosophy
or
history
or
care
for
the
beasts
birds
plants
and
rocks
with
any
intelligent
insight
or
even
real
curiosity
this
arouses
the
suspicion
that
our
liberal
education
miscarries
and
does
not
attain
its
ostensible
aims
the
three
educational
aims
enumerated
above
have
one
thing
in
common
they
are
all
directed
toward
an
enhancement
of
the
chances
of
worldly
success
or
to
the
increase
of
our
culture
and
intellectual
and
literary
enjoyment
their
purpose
is
not
primarily
to
fit
us
to
play
a
part
in
social
or
political
betterment
but
of
late
a
fourth
element
has
been
added
to
the
older
ambitions
namely
the
hope
of
preparing
boys
and
girls
to
become
intelligent
voters
this
need
has
been
forced
upon
us
by
the
coming
of
political
democracy
which
makes
one
person
vote
exactly
as
good
as
another
now
education
for
citizenship
would
seem
to
consist
in
gaining
a
knowledge
of
the
actual
workings
of
our
social
organization
with
some
illuminating
notions
of
its
origin
together
with
a
full
realization
of
its
defects
and
their
apparent
sources
but
here
we
encounter
an
obstacle
that
is
unimportant
in
the
older
types
of
education
but
which
may
prove
altogether
fatal
to
any
good
results
in
our
efforts
to
make
better
citizens
subjects
of
instruction
like
reading
and
writing
mathematics
latin
and
greek
chemistry
and
physics
medicine
and
the
law
are
fairly
well
standardized
and
retrospective
doubtless
there
is
a
good
deal
of
internal
change
in
method
and
content
going
on
but
this
takes
place
unobtrusively
and
does
not
attract
the
attention
of
outside
critics
political
and
social
questions
on
the
other
hand
and
matters
relating
to
prevailing
business
methods
race
animosities
public
elections
and
governmental
policy
are
if
they
are
vital
necessarily
controversial
school
boards
and
superintendents
trustees
and
presidents
of
colleges
and
universities
are
sensitive
to
this
fact
they
eagerly
deprecate
in
their
public
manifestos
any
suspicion
that
pupils
and
students
are
being
awakened
in
any
way
to
the
truth
that
our
institutions
can
possibly
be
fundamentally
defective
or
that
the
present
generation
of
citizens
has
not
conducted
our
affairs
with
exemplary
success
guided
by
the
immutable
principles
of
justice
how
indeed
can
a
teacher
be
expected
to
explain
to
the
sons
and
daughters
of
businessmen
politicians
doctors
lawyers
and
clergymen
all
pledged
to
the
maintenance
of
the
sources
of
their
livelihood
the
actual
nature
of
business
enterprise
as
now
practiced
the
prevailing
methods
of
legislative
bodies
and
courts
and
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
think
of
a
teacher
in
the
public
schools
recounting
the
more
illuminating
facts
about
the
municipal
government
under
which
he
lives
with
due
attention
to
graft
and
jobs
so
courses
in
government
political
economy
sociology
and
ethics
confine
themselves
to
inoffensive
generalizations
harmless
details
of
organization
and
the
commonplaces
of
routine
morality
for
only
in
that
way
can
they
escape
being
controversial
teachers
are
rarely
able
or
inclined
to
explain
our
social
life
and
its
presuppositions
with
sufficient
insight
and
honesty
to
produce
any
very
important
results
even
if
they
are
tempted
to
tell
the
essential
facts
they
dare
not
do
so
for
fear
of
losing
their
places
amid
the
applause
of
all
the
righteously
minded
however
we
may
feel
on
this
important
matter
we
must
all
agree
that
the
aim
of
education
for
citizenship
as
now
conceived
is
a
preparation
for
the
same
old
citizenship
which
has
so
far
failed
to
eliminate
the
shocking
hazards
and
crying
injustices
of
our
social
and
political
life
for
we
sedulously
inculcate
in
the
coming
generation
exactly
the
same
illusions
and
the
same
confidence
in
existing
institutions
and
prevailing
notions
that
have
brought
the
world
to
the
pass
in
which
we
find
it
since
we
do
all
we
can
to
corroborate
the
beneficence
of
what
we
have
we
can
hardly
hope
to
raise
up
a
more
intelligent
generation
bent
on
achieving
what
we
have
not
we
all
know
this
to
be
true
it
has
been
forcibly
impressed
on
our
minds
of
late
most
of
us
agree
that
it
is
right
and
best
that
it
should
be
so
some
of
us
do
not
like
to
think
about
it
at
all
but
a
few
will
be
glad
to
spend
a
little
time
weighing
certain
suggestions
in
this
volume
which
may
indicate
a
way
out
of
this
we
have
now
considered
briefly
the
three
main
hopes
that
have
been
hitherto
entertained
of
bettering
things
i
by
changing
the
rules
of
the
game
ii
by
urging
men
to
be
good
and
to
love
their
neighbor
as
themselves
and
iii
by
education
for
citizenship
it
may
be
that
these
hopes
are
not
wholly
unfounded
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
so
far
they
have
been
grievously
disappointed
doubtless
they
will
continue
to
be
cherished
on
account
of
their
assured
respectability
mere
lack
of
success
does
not
discredit
a
method
for
there
are
many
things
that
determine
and
perpetuate
our
sanctified
ways
of
doing
things
besides
their
success
in
reaching
their
proposed
ends
had
this
not
always
been
so
our
life
would
be
far
less
stupidly
conducted
than
it
is
but
let
us
agree
to
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
approved
schemes
of
reform
enumerated
above
have
to
say
the
least
shown
themselves
inadequate
to
meet
the
crisis
in
which
civilized
society
now
finds
itself
have
we
any
other
hope
yes
there
is
intelligence
that
is
as
yet
an
untested
hope
in
its
application
to
the
regulation
of
human
relations
it
is
not
discredited
because
it
has
not
been
tried
on
any
large
scale
outside
the
realm
of
natural
science
there
everyone
will
confess
it
has
produced
marvelous
results
employed
in
regard
to
stars
rocks
plants
and
animals
and
in
the
investigation
of
mechanical
and
chemical
processes
it
has
completely
revolutionized
men
notions
of
the
world
in
which
they
live
and
of
its
inhabitants
the
notable
exception
of
man
these
discoveries
have
been
used
to
change
our
habits
and
to
supply
us
with
everyday
necessities
which
a
hundred
years
ago
were
not
dreamed
of
as
luxuries
accessible
even
to
kings
and
millionaires
but
most
of
us
know
too
little
of
the
past
to
realize
the
penalty
that
had
to
be
paid
for
this
application
of
intelligence
in
order
that
these
discoveries
should
be
made
and
ingeniously
applied
to
the
conveniences
of
life
was
necessary
to
discard
practically
all
the
consecrated
notions
of
the
world
and
its
workings
which
had
been
held
by
the
best
and
wisest
and
purest
of
mankind
down
to
three
hundred
years
indeed
until
much
more
recently
intelligence
in
a
creature
of
routine
like
man
and
in
a
universe
so
ill
understood
as
ours
must
often
break
valiantly
with
the
past
in
order
to
get
ahead
it
would
be
pleasant
to
assume
that
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
build
on
foundations
firmly
laid
by
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
but
those
who
have
studied
the
history
of
natural
science
would
agree
that
bacon
galileo
and
descartes
found
no
such
foundation
but
had
to
begin
their
construction
from
the
ground
up
the
several
hopes
of
reform
mentioned
above
all
assume
that
the
now
generally
accepted
notions
of
righteous
human
conduct
are
not
to
be
questioned
our
churches
and
universities
defend
this
assumption
our
editors
and
lawyers
and
the
more
vocal
of
our
business
men
adhere
to
it
even
those
who
pretend
to
study
society
and
its
origin
seem
often
to
believe
that
our
present
ideals
and
standards
of
property
the
state
industrial
organization
the
relations
of
the
sexes
and
education
are
practically
final
and
must
necessarily
be
the
basis
of
any
possible
betterment
in
detail
but
if
this
be
so
intelligence
has
already
done
its
perfect
work
and
we
can
only
lament
that
the
outcome
in
the
way
of
peace
decency
and
fairness
judged
even
by
existing
standards
has
been
so
disappointing
there
are
of
course
a
few
here
and
there
who
suspect
and
even
repudiate
current
ideals
and
standards
but
at
present
their
resentment
against
existing
evils
takes
the
form
of
more
or
less
dogmatic
plans
of
reconstruction
like
those
of
the
socialists
and
communists
or
exhausts
itself
in
the
vague
protest
and
faultfinding
of
the
average
intellectual
neither
the
socialist
nor
the
common
run
of
intellectual
appears
to
me
to
be
on
the
right
track
the
former
is
more
precise
in
his
doctrines
and
confident
in
his
prophecies
than
a
scientific
examination
of
mankind
and
its
ways
would
at
all
justify
the
other
more
indefinite
than
he
need
be
if
intelligence
is
to
have
the
freedom
of
action
necessary
to
accumulate
new
and
valuable
knowledge
about
man
nature
and
possibilities
which
may
ultimately
be
applied
to
reforming
our
ways
it
must
loose
itself
from
the
bonds
that
now
confine
it
the
primeval
curse
still
holds
of
every
tree
in
the
garden
thou
mayest
freely
eat
but
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
thou
shalt
not
eat
of
it
for
in
the
day
that
thou
eatest
thereof
thou
shalt
surely
die
few
people
confess
that
they
are
afraid
of
knowledge
but
the
university
presidents
ministers
and
editors
who
most
often
and
publicly
laud
what
they
are
wont
to
call
the
fearless
pursuit
of
truth
feel
compelled
in
the
interest
of
public
morals
and
order
to
discourage
any
reckless
indulgence
in
the
fruit
of
the
forbidden
tree
for
the
inexperienced
may
select
an
unripe
apple
and
suffer
from
the
colic
in
consequence
just
look
at
russia
better
always
instead
of
taking
the
risk
on
what
the
church
calls
science
falsely
so
called
fall
back
on
ignorance
rightly
so
called
no
one
denies
that
intelligence
is
the
light
of
the
world
and
the
chief
glory
of
man
but
as
bertrand
russell
says
we
dread
its
indifference
to
respectable
opinions
and
what
we
deem
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
it
is
as
he
truly
says
fear
that
holds
men
back
fear
that
their
cherished
beliefs
should
prove
harmful
fear
lest
they
themselves
should
prove
less
worthy
of
respect
than
they
have
supposed
themselves
to
be
the
workingman
think
freely
about
property
what
then
will
become
of
us
the
rich
should
young
men
and
women
think
freely
about
sex
what
then
will
become
of
morality
should
soldiers
think
freely
about
war
what
then
will
become
of
military
discipline
this
fear
is
natural
and
inevitable
but
it
is
none
the
less
dangerous
and
discreditable
human
arrangements
are
no
longer
so
foolproof
as
they
may
once
have
been
when
the
world
moved
far
more
slowly
than
it
now

it
should
therefore
be
a
good
deed
to
remove
or
lighten
any
of
the
various
restraints
on
thought
i
believe
that
there
is
an
easy
and
relatively
painless
way
in
which
our
respect
for
the
past
can
be
lessened
so
that
we
shall
no
longer
feel
compelled
to
take
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
as
the
basis
of
our
reforms
my
own
confidence
in
what
president
butler
calls
the
findings
of
mankind
is
gone
and
the
process
by
which
it
was
lost
will
become
obvious
as
we
proceed
i
have
no
reforms
to
recommend
except
the
liberation
of
intelligence
which
is
the
first
and
most
essential
one
i
propose
to
review
by
way
of
introduction
some
of
the
new
ideas
which
have
been
emerging
during
the
past
few
years
in
regard
to
our
minds
and
their
operations
then
we
shall
proceed
to
the
main
theme
of
the
book
a
sketch
of
the
manner
in
which
our
human
intelligence
appears
to
have
come
about
if
anyone
will
follow
the
story
with
a
fair
degree
of
sympathy
and
patience
he
may
by
merely
putting
together
facts
many
of
which
he
doubtless
knows
in
other
connections
hope
better
to
understand
the
perilous
quandary
in
which
mankind
is
now
placed
and
the
ways
of
escape
that
offer
themselves

george
bernard
shaw
reaches
a
similar
conclusion
when
he
contemplates
education
in
the
british
isles

must
teach
citizenship
and
political
science
at
school
but
must

there
is
no

it
the
hard
fact
being
that
we
must
not
teach
political
science
or

schoolmaster
who
attempted
it
would
soon
find
himself

streets

not

of
william

on
various
kinds
of
thinking
the
truest
and
most
profound
observations
on
intelligence
have
in
the
past
been
made
by
the
poets
and
in
recent
times
by
they
have
been
keen
observers
and
recorders
and
reckoned
freely
with
the
emotions
and
sentiments
most
philosophers
on
the
other
hand
have
exhibited
a
grotesque
ignorance
of
man
life
and
have
built
up
systems
that
are
elaborate
and
imposing
but
quite
unrelated
to
actual
human
affairs
they
have
almost
consistently
neglected
the
actual
process
of
thought
and
have
set
the
mind
off
as
something
apart
to
be
studied
by
itself
no
such
mind
exempt
from
bodily
processes
animal
impulses
savage
traditions
infantile
impressions
conventional
reactions
and
traditional
knowledge
ever
even
in
the
case
of
the
most
abstract
of
metaphysicians
kant
entitled
his
great
work
critique
of
pure
but
to
the
modern
student
of
mind
pure
reason
seems
as
mythical
as
the
pure
gold
transparent
as
glass
with
which
the
celestial
city
is
paved
formerly
philosophers
thought
of
mind
as
having
to
do
exclusively
with
conscious
thought
it
was
that
within
man
which
perceived
remembered
judged
reasoned
understood
believed
willed
but
of
late
it
has
been
shown
that
we
are
unaware
of
a
great
part
of
what
we
perceive
remember
will
and
infer
and
that
a
great
part
of
the
thinking
of
which
we
are
aware
is
determined
by
that
of
which
we
are
not
conscious
it
has
indeed
been
demonstrated
that
our
unconscious
psychic
life
far
outruns
our
conscious
this
seems
perfectly
natural
to
anyone
who
considers
the
following
facts
the
sharp
distinction
between
the
mind
and
the
body
is
as
we
shall
find
a
very
ancient
and
spontaneous
uncritical
savage
prepossession
what
we
think
of
as
mind
is
so
intimately
associated
with
what
we
call
body
that
we
are
coming
to
realize
that
the
one
can
not
be
understood
without
the
other
every
thought
reverberates
through
the
body
and
on
the
other
hand
alterations
in
our
physical
condition
affect
our
whole
attitude
of
mind
the
insufficient
elimination
of
the
foul
and
decaying
products
of
digestion
may
plunge
us
into
deep
melancholy
whereas
a
few
whiffs
of
nitrous
monoxide
may
exalt
us
to
the
seventh
heaven
of
supernal
knowledge
and
godlike
complacency
and
vice
versa
a
sudden
word
or
thought
may
cause
our
heart
to
jump
check
our
breathing
or
make
our
knees
as
water
there
is
a
whole
new
literature
growing
up
which
studies
the
effects
of
our
bodily
secretions
and
our
muscular
tensions
and
their
relation
to
our
emotions
and
our
thinking
then
there
are
hidden
impulses
and
desires
and
secret
longings
of
which
we
can
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
take
account
they
influence
our
conscious
thought
in
the
most
bewildering
fashion
many
of
these
unconscious
influences
appear
to
originate
in
our
very
early
years
the
older
philosophers
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
even
they
were
infants
and
children
at
their
most
impressionable
age
and
never
could
by
any
possibility
get
over
it
the
term
unconscious
now
so
familiar
to
all
readers
of
modern
works
on
psychology
gives
offense
to
some
adherents
of
the
past
there
should
however
be
no
special
mystery
about
it
it
is
not
a
new
animistic
abstraction
but
simply
a
collective
word
to
include
all
the
physiological
changes
which
escape
our
notice
all
the
forgotten
experiences
and
impressions
of
the
past
which
continue
to
influence
our
desires
and
reflections
and
conduct
even
if
we
can
not
remember
them
what
we
can
remember
at
any
time
is
indeed
an
infinitesimal
part
of
what
has
happened
to
us
we
could
not
remember
anything
unless
we
forgot
almost
everything
as
bergson
says
the
brain
is
the
organ
of
forgetfulness
as
well
as
of
memory
moreover
we
tend
of
course
to
become
oblivious
to
things
to
which
we
are
thoroughly
accustomed
for
habit
blinds
us
to
their
existence
so
the
forgotten
and
the
habitual
make
up
a
great
part
of
the
unconscious
if
we
are
ever
to
understand
man
his
conduct
and
reasoning
and
if
we
aspire
to
learn
to
guide
his
life
and
his
relations
with
his
fellows
more
happily
than
heretofore
we
can
not
neglect
the
great
discoveries
briefly
noted
above
we
must
reconcile
ourselves
to
novel
and
revolutionary
conceptions
of
the
mind
for
it
is
clear
that
the
older
philosophers
whose
works
still
determine
our
current
views
had
a
very
superficial
notion
of
the
subject
with
which
they
dealt
but
for
our
purposes
with
due
regard
to
what
has
just
been
said
and
to
much
that
has
necessarily
been
left
unsaid
and
with
the
indulgence
of
those
who
will
at
first
be
inclined
to
dissent
shall
consider
mind
chiefly
as
conscious
knowledge
and
intelligence
as
what
we
know
and
our
attitude
toward
it
our
disposition
to
increase
our
information
classify
it
criticize
it
and
apply
we
do
not
think
enough
about
thinking
and
much
of
our
confusion
is
the
result
of
current
illusions
in
regard
to
it
let
us
forget
for
the
moment
any
impressions
we
may
have
derived
from
the
philosophers
and
see
what
seems
to
happen
in
ourselves
the
first
thing
that
we
notice
is
that
our
thought
moves
with
such
incredible
rapidity
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
arrest
any
specimen
of
it
long
enough
to
have
a
look
at
it
when
we
are
offered
a
penny
for
our
thoughts
we
always
find
that
we
have
recently
had
so
many
things
in
mind
that
we
can
easily
make
a
selection
which
will
not
compromise
us
too
nakedly
on
inspection
we
shall
find
that
even
if
we
are
not
downright
ashamed
of
a
great
part
of
our
spontaneous
thinking
it
is
far
too
intimate
personal
ignoble
or
trivial
to
permit
us
to
reveal
more
than
a
small
part
of
it
i
believe
this
must
be
true
of
everyone
we
do
not
of
course
know
what
goes
on
in
other
people
heads
they
tell
us
very
little
and
we
tell
them
very
little
the
spigot
of
speech
rarely
fully
opened
could
never
emit
more
than
driblets
of
the
ever
renewed
hogshead
of
thought
grösser
wie
heidelberger
we
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
other
people
thoughts
are
as
silly
as
our
own
but
they
probably
are
we
all
appear
to
ourselves
to
be
thinking
all
the
time
during
our
waking
hours
and
most
of
us
are
aware
that
we
go
on
thinking
while
we
are
asleep
even
more
foolishly
than
when
awake
when
uninterrupted
by
some
practical
issue
we
are
engaged
in
what
is
now
known
as
a
this
is
our
spontaneous
and
favorite
kind
of
thinking
we
allow
our
ideas
to
take
their
own
course
and
this
course
is
determined
by
our
hopes
and
fears
our
spontaneous
desires
their
fulfillment
or
frustration
by
our
likes
and
dislikes
our
loves
and
hates
and
resentments
there
is
nothing
else
anything
like
so
interesting
to
ourselves
as
ourselves
all
thought
that
is
not
more
or
less
laboriously
controlled
and
directed
will
inevitably
circle
about
the
beloved
ego
it
is
amusing
and
pathetic
to
observe
this
tendency
in
ourselves
and
in
others
we
learn
politely
and
generously
to
overlook
this
truth
but
if
we
dare
to
think
of
it
it
blazes
forth
like
the
noontide
sun
the
reverie
or
free
association
of
ideas
has
of
late
become
the
subject
of
scientific
research
while
investigators
are
not
yet
agreed
on
the
results
or
at
least
on
the
proper
interpretation
to
be
given
to
them
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
our
reveries
form
the
chief
index
to
our
fundamental
character
they
are
a
reflection
of
our
nature
as
modified
by
often
hidden
and
forgotten
experiences
we
need
not
go
into
the
matter
further
here
for
it
is
only
necessary
to
observe
that
the
reverie
is
at
all
times
a
potent
and
in
many
cases
an
omnipotent
rival
to
every
other
kind
of
thinking
it
doubtless
influences
all
our
speculations
in
its
persistent
tendency
to
and
which
are
its
chief
preoccupations
but
it
is
the
last
thing
to
make
directly
or
indirectly
for
honest
increase
of
knowledge
philosophers
usually
talk
as
if
such
thinking
did
not
exist
or
were
in
some
way
negligible
this
is
what
makes
their
speculations
so
unreal
and
often
worthless
the
reverie
as
any
of
us
can
see
for
himself
is
frequently
broken
and
interrupted
by
the
necessity
of
a
second
kind
of
thinking
we
have
to
make
practical
decisions
shall
we
write
a
letter
or
no
shall
we
take
the
subway
or
a
bus
shall
we
have
dinner
at
seven
or
half
past
shall
we
buy
rubber
or
a
liberty
bond
decisions
are
easily
distinguishable
from
the
free
flow
of
the
reverie
sometimes
they
demand
a
good
deal
of
careful
pondering
and
the
recollection
of
pertinent
facts
often
however
they
are
made
impulsively
they
are
a
more
difficult
and
laborious
thing
than
the
reverie
and
we
resent
having
to
make
up
our
mind
when
we
are
tired
or
absorbed
in
a
congenial
reverie
weighing
a
decision
it
should
be
noted
does
not
necessarily
add
anything
to
our
knowledge
although
we
may
of
course
seek
further
information
before
making
it
rationalizing
a
third
kind
of
thinking
is
stimulated
when
anyone
questions
our
belief
and
opinions
we
sometimes
find
ourselves
changing
our
minds
without
any
resistance
or
heavy
emotion
but
if
we
are
told
that
we
are
wrong
we
resent
the
imputation
and
harden
our
hearts
we
are
incredibly
heedless
in
the
formation
of
our
beliefs
but
find
ourselves
filled
with
an
illicit
passion
for
them
when
anyone
proposes
to
rob
us
of
their
companionship
it
is
obviously
not
the
ideas
themselves
that
are
dear
to
us
but
our
which
is
threatened
we
are
by
nature
stubbornly
pledged
to
defend
our
own
from
attack
whether
it
be
our
person
our
family
our
property
or
our
opinion
a
united
states
senator
once
remarked
to
a
friend
of
mine
that
god
almighty
could
not
make
him
change
his
mind
on
our
policy
we
may
surrender
but
rarely
confess
ourselves
vanquished
in
the
intellectual
world
at
least
peace
is
without
victory
few
of
us
take
the
pains
to
study
the
origin
of
our
cherished
convictions
indeed
we
have
a
natural
repugnance
to
so
doing
we
like
to
continue
to
believe
what
we
have
been
accustomed
to
accept
as
true
and
the
resentment
aroused
when
doubt
is
cast
upon
any
of
our
assumptions
leads
us
to
seek
every
manner
of
excuse
for
clinging
to
them
result
is
that
most
of
our
reasoning
consists
in
finding
arguments
for
going
on
believing
as
we
already
i
remember
years
ago
attending
a
public
dinner
to
which
the
governor
of
the
state
was
bidden
the
chairman
explained
that
his
excellency
could
not
be
present
for
certain
good
reasons
what
the
real
reasons
were
the
presiding
officer
said
he
would
leave
us
to
conjecture
this
distinction
between
good
and
real
reasons
is
one
of
the
most
clarifying
and
essential
in
the
whole
realm
of
thought
we
can
readily
give
what
seem
to
us
good
reasons
for
being
a
catholic
or
a
mason
a
republican
or
a
democrat
an
adherent
or
opponent
of
the
league
of
nations
but
the
real
reasons
are
usually
on
quite
a
different
plane
of
course
the
importance
of
this
distinction
is
popularly
if
somewhat
obscurely
recognized
the
baptist
missionary
is
ready
enough
to
see
that
the
buddhist
is
not
such
because
his
doctrines
would
bear
careful
inspection
but
because
he
happened
to
be
born
in
a
buddhist
family
in
tokio
but
it
would
be
treason
to
his
faith
to
acknowledge
that
his
own
partiality
for
certain
doctrines
is
due
to
the
fact
that
his
mother
was
a
member
of
the
first
baptist
church
of
oak
ridge
a
savage
can
give
all
sorts
of
reasons
for
his
belief
that
it
is
dangerous
to
step
on
a
man
shadow
and
a
newspaper
editor
can
advance
plenty
of
arguments
against
the
bolsheviki
but
neither
of
them
may
realize
why
he
happens
to
be
defending
his
particular
opinion
the
real
reasons
for
our
beliefs
are
concealed
from
ourselves
as
well
as
from
others
as
we
grow
up
we
simply
adopt
the
ideas
presented
to
us
in
regard
to
such
matters
as
religion
family
relations
property
business
our
country
and
the
state
we
unconsciously
absorb
them
from
our
environment
they
are
persistently
whispered
in
our
ear
by
the
group
in
which
we
happen
to
live
moreover
as
trotter
has
pointed
out
these
judgments
being
the
product
of
suggestion
and
not
of
reasoning
have
the
quality
of
perfect
obviousness
so
that
to
question
them
is
to
the
believer
to
carry
skepticism
to
an
insane
degree
and
will
be
met
by
contempt
disapproval
or
condemnation
according
to
the
nature
of
the
belief
in
question
when
therefore
we
find
ourselves
entertaining
an
opinion
about
the
basis
of
which
there
is
a
quality
of
feeling
which
tells
us
that
to
inquire
into
it
would
be
absurd
obviously
unnecessary
unprofitable
undesirable
bad
form
or
wicked
we
may
know
that
that
opinion
is
a
nonrational
one
and
probably
therefore
founded
upon
inadequate
evidence
opinions
on
the
other
hand
which
are
the
result
of
experience
or
of
honest
reasoning
do
not
have
this
quality
of
primary
certitude
i
remember
when
as
a
youth
i
heard
a
group
of
business
men
discussing
the
question
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
i
was
outraged
by
the
sentiment
of
doubt
expressed
by
one
of
the
party
as
i
look
back
now
i
see
that
i
had
at
the
time
no
interest
in
the
matter
and
certainly
no
least
argument
to
urge
in
favor
of
the
belief
in
which
i
had
been
reared
but
neither
my
personal
indifference
to
the
issue
nor
the
fact
that
i
had
previously
given
it
no
attention
served
to
prevent
an
angry
resentment
when
i
heard
ideas
questioned
this
spontaneous
and
loyal
support
of
our
preconceptions
this
process
of
finding
good
reasons
to
justify
our
routine
beliefs
is
known
to
modern
psychologists
as
rationalizing
clearly
only
a
new
name
for
a
very
ancient
thing
our
good
reasons
ordinarily
have
no
value
in
promoting
honest
enlightenment
because
no
matter
how
solemnly
they
may
be
marshaled
they
are
at
bottom
the
result
of
personal
preference
or
prejudice
and
not
of
an
honest
desire
to
seek
or
accept
new
knowledge
in
our
reveries
we
are
frequently
engaged
in
for
we
can
not
bear
to
think
ourselves
wrong
and
yet
have
constant
illustrations
of
our
weaknesses
and
mistakes
so
we
spend
much
time
finding
fault
with
circumstances
and
the
conduct
of
others
and
shifting
on
to
them
with
great
ingenuity
the
on
us
of
our
own
failures
and
disappointments
is
the
which
occurs
when
we
feel
ourselves
or
our
group
accused
of
misapprehension
or
the
little
word
is
the
most
important
one
in
all
human
affairs
and
properly
to
reckon
with
it
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
it
has
the
same
force
whether
it
is
dinner
dog
and
house
or
faith
country
and
we
not
only
resent
the
imputation
that
our
watch
is
wrong
or
our
car
shabby
but
that
our
conception
of
the
canals
of
mars
of
the
pronunciation
of
epictetus
of
the
medicinal
value
of
salicine
or
the
date
of
sargon
i
are
subject
to
revision
philosophers
scholars
and
men
of
science
exhibit
a
common
sensitiveness
in
all
decisions
in
which
their
is
involved
thousands
of
argumentative
works
have
been
written
to
vent
a
grudge
however
stately
their
reasoning
it
may
be
nothing
but
rationalizing
stimulated
by
the
most
commonplace
of
all
motives
a
history
of
philosophy
and
theology
could
be
written
in
terms
of
grouches
wounded
pride
and
aversions
and
it
would
be
far
more
instructive
than
the
usual
treatments
of
these
themes
sometimes
under
providence
the
lowly
impulse
of
resentment
leads
to
great
achievements
milton
wrote
his
treatise
on
divorce
as
a
result
of
his
troubles
with
his
wife
and
when
he
was
accused
of
being
the
leading
spirit
in
a
new
sect
the
divorcers
he
wrote
his
noble
to
prove
his
right
to
say
what
he
thought
fit
and
incidentally
to
establish
the
advantage
of
a
free
press
in
the
promotion
of
truth
all
mankind
high
and

thinks
in
all
the
ways
which
have
been
described
the
reverie
goes
on
all
the
time
not
only
in
the
mind
of
the
mill
hand
and
the
broadway
flapper
but
equally
in
weighty
judges
and
godly
bishops
it
has
gone
on
in
all
the
philosophers
scientists

and
theologians
that
have
ever
lived
aristotle
most
abstruse
speculations
were
doubtless
tempered
by
highly
irrelevant
reflections
he
is
reported
to
have
had
very
thin
legs
and
small
eyes
for
which
he
doubtless
had
to
find
excuses
and
he
was
wont
to
indulge
in
very
conspicuous
dress
and
rings
and
was
accustomed
to
arrange
his
hair

diogenes

the
impudence
of

his

tennyson
in
beginning
his
maud

not
forget
his
chagrin
over
losing
his
patrimony
years
before
as
the
result
of
an
unhappy
investment
in
the

these
facts
are
not
recalled
here
as
a
gratuitous
disparagement
of
the
truly
great
but
to
insure
a
full
realization
of
the
tremendous
competition
which
all
really
exacting
thought
has
to
face
even
in
the
minds
of
the
most
highly
endowed
mortals
and
now
the
astonishing
and
perturbing
suspicion
emerges
that
perhaps
almost
all
that
had
passed
for
social
science
political
economy
politics
and
ethics
in
the
past
may
be
brushed
aside
by
future
generations
as
mainly
rationalizing
john
dewey
has
already
reached
this
conclusion
in
regard
to
philosophy
veblen
and
other
writers
have
revealed
the
various
unperceived
presuppositions
of
the
traditional
political
economy
and
now
comes
an
italian
sociologist
vilfredo
pareto
who
in
his
huge
treatise
on
general
sociology
devotes
hundreds
of
pages
to
substantiating
a
similar
thesis
affecting
all
the
social
sciences
this
conclusion
may
be
ranked
by
students
of
a
hundred
years
hence
as
one
of
the
several
great
discoveries
of
our
age
it
is
by
no
means
fully
worked
out
and
it
is
so
opposed
to
nature
that
it
will
be
very
slowly
accepted
by
the
great
mass
of
those
who
consider
themselves
thoughtful
as
a
historical
student
i
am
personally
fully
reconciled
to
this
newer
view
indeed
it
seems
to
me
inevitable
that
just
as
the
various
sciences
of
nature
were
before
the
opening
of
the
seventeenth
century
largely
masses
of
rationalizations
to
suit
the
religious
sentiments
of
the
period
so
the
social
sciences
have
continued
even
to
our
own
day
to
be
rationalizations
of
uncritically
accepted
beliefs
and
customs
will
become
apparent
as
we
proceed
that
the
fact
that
an
idea
is
ancient
and
that
it
has
been
widely
received
is
no
argument
in
its
favor
but
should
immediately
suggest
the
necessity
of
carefully
testing
it
as
a
probable
instance
of
how
creative
thought
transforms
the
world
this
brings
us
to
another
kind
of
thought
which
can
fairly
easily
be
distinguished
from
the
three
kinds
described
above
it
has
not
the
usual
qualities
of
the
reverie
for
it
does
not
hover
about
our
personal
complacencies
and
humiliations
it
is
not
made
up
of
the
homely
decisions
forced
upon
us
by
everyday
needs
when
we
review
our
little
stock
of
existing
information
consult
our
conventional
preferences
and
obligations
and
make
a
choice
of
action
it
is
not
the
defense
of
our
own
cherished
beliefs
and
prejudices
just
because
they
are
our
own
mere
plausible
excuses
for
remaining
of
the
same
mind
on
the
contrary
it
is
that
peculiar
species
of
thought
which
leads
us
to
our
mind
it
is
this
kind
of
thought
that
has
raised
man
from
his
pristine
subsavage
ignorance
and
squalor
to
the
degree
of
knowledge
and
comfort
which
he
now
possesses
on
his
capacity
to
continue
and
greatly
extend
this
kind
of
thinking
depends
his
chance
of
groping
his
way
out
of
the
plight
in
which
the
most
highly
civilized
peoples
of
the
world
now
find
themselves
in
the
past
this
type
of
thinking
has
been
called
reason
but
so
many
misapprehensions
have
grown
up
around
the
word
that
some
of
us
have
become
very
suspicious
of
it
i
suggest
therefore
that
we
substitute
a
recent
name
and
speak
of
creative
thought
rather
than
of
reason
this
kind
of
meditation
begets
knowledge
and
knowledge
is
really
creative
inasmuch
as
it
makes
things
look
different
from
what
they
seemed
before
and
may
indeed
work
for
their
in
certain
moods
some
of
us
realize
that
we
are
observing
things
or
making
reflections
with
a
seeming
disregard
of
our
personal
preoccupations
we
are
not
preening
or
defending
ourselves
we
are
not
faced
by
the
necessity
of
any
practical
decision
nor
are
we
apologizing
for
believing
this
or
that
we
are
just
wondering
and
looking
and
mayhap
seeing
what
we
never
perceived
before
curiosity
is
as
clear
and
definite
as
any
of
our
urges
we
wonder
what
is
in
a
sealed
telegram
or
in
a
letter
in
which
some
one
else
is
absorbed
or
what
is
being
said
in
the
telephone
booth
or
in
low
conversation
this
inquisitiveness
is
vastly
stimulated
by
jealousy
suspicion
or
any
hint
that
we
ourselves
are
directly
or
indirectly
involved
but
there
appears
to
be
a
fair
amount
of
personal
interest
in
other
people
affairs
even
when
they
do
not
concern
us
except
as
a
mystery
to
be
unraveled
or
a
tale
to
be
told
the
reports
of
a
divorce
suit
will
have
news
value
for
many
weeks
they
constitute
a
story
like
a
novel
or
play
or
moving
picture
this
is
not
an
example
of
pure
curiosity
however
since
we
readily
identify
ourselves
with
others
and
their
joys
and
despair
then
become
our
own
we
also
take
note
of
or
observe
as
sherlock
holmes
says
things
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
personal
interests
and
make
no
personal
appeal
either
direct
or
by
way
of
sympathy
this
is
what
veblen
so
well
calls
idle
curiosity
and
it
is
usually
idle
enough
some
of
us
when
we
face
the
line
of
people
opposite
us
in
a
subway
train
impulsively
consider
them
in
detail
and
engage
in
rapid
inferences
and
form
theories
in
regard
to
them
on
entering
a
room
there
are
those
who
will
perceive
at
a
glance
the
degree
of
preciousness
of
the
rugs
the
character
of
the
pictures
and
the
personality
revealed
by
the
books
but
there
are
many
it
would
seem
who
are
so
absorbed
in
their
personal
reverie
or
in
some
definite
purpose
that
they
have
no
energy
for
idle
curiosity
the
tendency
to
miscellaneous
observation
we
come
by
honestly
enough
for
we
note
it
in
many
of
our
animal
relatives
veblen
however
uses
the
term
idle
curiosity
somewhat
ironically
as
is
his
wont
it
is
idle
only
to
those
who
fail
to
realize
that
it
may
be
a
very
rare
and
indispensable
thing
from
which
almost
all
distinguished
human
achievement
proceeds
since
it
may
lead
to
systematic
examination
and
seeking
for
things
hitherto
undiscovered
for
research
is
but
diligent
search
which
enjoys
the
high
flavor
of
primitive
hunting
occasionally
and
fitfully
idle
curiosity
thus
leads
to
creative
thought
which
alters
and
broadens
our
own
views
and
aspirations
and
may
in
turn
under
highly
favorable
circumstances
affect
the
views
and
lives
of
others
even
for
generations
to
follow
an
example
or
two
will
make
this
unique
human
process
clear
galileo
was
a
thoughtful
youth
and
doubtless
carried
on
a
rich
and
varied
reverie
he
had
artistic
ability
and
might
have
turned
out
to
be
a
musician
or
painter
when
he
had
dwelt
among
the
monks
at
valambrosa
he
had
been
tempted
to
lead
the
life
of
a
religious
as
a
boy
he
busied
himself
with
toy
machines
and
he
inherited
a
fondness
for
mathematics
all
these
facts
are
of
record
we
may
safely
assume
also
that
along
with
many
other
subjects
of
contemplation
the
pisan
maidens
found
a
vivid
place
in
his
thoughts
one
day
when
seventeen
years
old
he
wandered
into
the
cathedral
of
his
native
town
in
the
midst
of
his
reverie
he
looked
up
at
the
lamps
hanging
by
long
chains
from
the
high
ceiling
of
the
church
then
something
very
difficult
to
explain
occurred
he
found
himself
no
longer
thinking
of
the
building
worshipers
or
the
services
of
his
artistic
or
religious
interests
of
his
reluctance
to
become
a
physician
as
his
father
wished
he
forgot
the
question
of
a
career
and
even
the
as
he
watched
the
swinging
lamps
he
was
suddenly
wondering
if
mayhap
their
oscillations
whether
long
or
short
did
not
occupy
the
same
time
then
he
tested
this
hypothesis
by
counting
his
pulse
for
that
was
the
only
timepiece
he
had
with
him
this
observation
however
remarkable
in
itself
was
not
enough
to
produce
a
really
creative
thought
others
may
have
noticed
the
same
thing
and
yet
nothing
came
of
it
most
of
our
observations
have
no
assignable
results
galileo
may
have
seen
that
the
warts
on
a
peasant
face
formed
a
perfect
isosceles
triangle
or
he
may
have
noticed
with
boyish
glee
that
just
as
the
officiating
priest
was
uttering
the
solemn
words
agnus
a
fly
lit
on
the
end
of
his
nose
to
be
really
creative
ideas
have
to
be
worked
up
and
then
put
over
so
that
they
become
a
part
of
man
social
heritage
the
highly
accurate
pendulum
clock
was
one
of
the
later
results
of
galileo
discovery
he
himself
was
led
to
reconsider
and
successfully
to
refute
the
old
notions
of
falling
bodies
it
remained
for
newton
to
prove
that
the
moon
was
falling
and
presumably
all
the
heavenly
bodies
this
quite
upset
all
the
consecrated
views
of
the
heavens
as
managed
by
angelic
engineers
the
universality
of
the
laws
of
gravitation
stimulated
the
attempt
to
seek
other
and
equally
important
natural
laws
and
cast
grave
doubts
on
the
miracles
in
which
mankind
had
hitherto
believed
in
short
those
who
dared
to
include
in
their
thought
the
discoveries
of
galileo
and
his
successors
found
themselves
in
a
new
earth
surrounded
by
new
heavens
on
the
of
october
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
galileo
had
noticed
the
isochronous
vibrations
of
the
lamps
creative
thought
and
its
currency
had
so
far
increased
that
faraday
was
wondering
what
would
happen
if
he
mounted
a
disk
of
copper
between
the
poles
of
a
horseshoe
magnet
as
the
disk
revolved
an
electric
current
was
produced
this
would
doubtless
have
seemed
the
idlest
kind
of
an
experiment
to
the
stanch
business
men
of
the
time
who
it
happened
were
just
then
denouncing
the
bills
in
their
anxiety
to
avail
themselves
to
the
full
of
the
results
of
earlier
idle
curiosity
but
should
the
dynamos
and
motors
which
have
come
into
being
as
the
outcome
of
faraday
experiment
be
stopped
this
evening
the
business
man
of
agitated
over
labor
troubles
might
as
he
trudged
home
past
lines
of
dead
cars
through
dark
streets
to
an
unlighted
house
engage
in
a
little
creative
thought
of
his
own
and
perceive
that
he
and
his
laborers
would
have
no
modern
factories
and
mines
to
quarrel
about
had
it
not
been
for
the
strange
practical
effects
of
the
idle
curiosity
of
scientists
inventors
and
engineers
the
examples
of
creative
intelligence
given
above
belong
to
the
realm
of
modern
scientific
achievement
which
furnishes
the
most
striking
instances
of
the
effects
of
scrupulous
objective
thinking
but
there
are
of
course
other
great
realms
in
which
the
recording
and
embodiment
of
acute
observation
and
insight
have
wrought
themselves
into
the
higher
life
of
man
the
great
poets
and
dramatists
and
our
modern
have
found
themselves
engaged
in
productive
reveries
noting
and
artistically
presenting
their
discoveries
for
the
delight
and
instruction
of
those
who
have
the
ability
to
appreciate
them
the
process
by
which
a
fresh
and
original
poem
or
drama
comes
into
being
is
doubtless
analogous
to
that
which
originates
and
elaborates
scientific
discoveries
but
there
is
clearly
a
temperamental
difference
the
genesis
and
advance
of
painting
sculpture
and
music
offer
still
other
problems
we
really
as
yet
know
shockingly
little
about
these
matters
and
indeed
very
few
people
have
the
least
curiosity
about
them
nevertheless
creative
intelligence
in
its
various
forms
and
activities
is
what
makes
man
were
it
not
for
its
slow
painful
and
constantly
discouraged
operations
through
the
ages
man
would
be
no
more
than
a
species
of
primate
living
on
seeds
fruit
roots
and
uncooked
flesh
and
wandering
naked
through
the
woods
and
over
the
plains
like
a
chimpanzee
the
origin
and
progress
and
future
promotion
of
civilization
are
ill
understood
and
misconceived
these
should
be
made
the
chief
theme
of
education
but
much
hard
work
is
necessary
before
we
can
reconstruct
our
ideas
of
man
and
his
capacities
and
free
ourselves
from
innumerable
persistent
misapprehensions
there
have
been
obstructionists
in
all
times
not
merely
the
lethargic
masses
but
the
moralists
the
rationalizing
theologians
and
most
of
the
philosophers
all
busily
if
unconsciously
engaged
in
ratifying
existing
ignorance
and
mistakes
and
discouraging
creative
thought
naturally
those
who
reassure
us
seem
worthy
of
honor
and
respect
equally
naturally
those
who
puzzle
us
with
disturbing
criticisms
and
invite
us
to
change
our
ways
are
objects
of
suspicion
and
readily
discredited
our
personal
discontent
does
not
ordinarily
extend
to
any
critical
questioning
of
the
general
situation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
in
every
age
the
prevailing
conditions
of
civilization
have
appeared
quite
natural
and
inevitable
to
those
who
grew
up
in
them
the
cow
asks
no
questions
as
to
how
it
happens
to
have
a
dry
stall
and
a
supply
of
hay
the
kitten
laps
its
warm
milk
from
a
china
saucer
without
knowing
anything
about
porcelain
the
dog
nestles
in
the
corner
of
a
divan
with
no
sense
of
obligation
to
the
inventors
of
upholstery
and
the
manufacturers
of
down
pillows
so
we
humans
accept
our
breakfasts
our
trains
and
telephones
and
orchestras
and
movies
our
national
constitution
or
moral
code
and
standards
of
manners
with
the
simplicity
and
innocence
of
a
pet
rabbit
we
have
absolutely
inexhaustible
capacities
for
appropriating
what
others
do
for
us
with
no
thought
of
a
thank
you
we
do
not
feel
called
upon
to
make
any
least
contribution
to
the
merry
game
ourselves
indeed
we
are
usually
quite
unaware
that
a
game
is
being
played
at
all
we
have
now
examined
the
various
classes
of
thinking
which
we
can
readily
observe
in
ourselves
and
which
we
have
plenty
of
reasons
to
believe
go
on
and
always
have
been
going
on
in
our
we
can
sometimes
get
quite
pure
and
sparkling
examples
of
all
four
kinds
but
commonly
they
are
so
confused
and
intermingled
in
our
reverie
as
not
to
be
readily
distinguishable
the
reverie
is
a
reflection
of
our
longings
exultations
and
complacencies
our
fears
suspicions
and
disappointments
we
are
chiefly
engaged
in
struggling
to
maintain
our
and
in
asserting
that
supremacy
which
we
all
crave
and
which
seems
to
us
our
natural
prerogative
it
is
not
strange
but
rather
quite
inevitable
that
our
beliefs
about
what
is
true
and
false
good
and
bad
right
and
wrong
should
be
mixed
up
with
the
reverie
and
be
influenced
by
the
same
considerations
which
determine
its
character
and
course
we
resent
criticisms
of
our
views
exactly
as
we
do
of
anything
else
connected
with
ourselves
our
notions
of
life
and
its
ideals
seem
to
us
to
be
and
as
such
necessarily
true
and
right
to
be
defended
at
all
costs
very
rarely
consider
however
the
process
by
which
we
gained
our
if
we
did
so
we
could
hardly
fail
to
see
that
there
was
usually
little
ground
for
our
confidence
in
them
here
and
there
in
this
department
of
knowledge
or
that
some
one
of
us
might
make
a
fair
claim
to
have
taken
some
trouble
to
get
correct
ideas
of
let
us
say
the
situation
in
russia
the
sources
of
our
food
supply
the
origin
of
the
constitution
the
revision
of
the
tariff
the
policy
of
the
holy
roman
apostolic
church
modern
business
organization
trade
unions
birth
control
socialism
the
league
of
nations
the
tax
preparedness
advertising
in
its
social
bearings
but
only
a
very
exceptional
person
would
be
entitled
to
opinions
on
all
of
even
these
few
matters
and
yet
most
of
us
have
opinions
on
all
these
and
on
many
other
questions
of
equal
importance
of
which
we
may
know
even
less
we
feel
compelled
as
persons
to
take
sides
when
they
come
up
for
discussion
we
even
surprise
ourselves
by
our
omniscience
without
taking
thought
we
see
in
a
flash
that
it
is
most
righteous
and
expedient
to
discourage
birth
control
by
legislative
enactment
or
that
one
who
decries
intervention
in
mexico
is
clearly
wrong
or
that
big
advertising
is
essential
to
big
business
and
that
big
business
is
the
pride
of
the
land
as
godlike
beings
why
should
we
not
rejoice
in
our
omniscience
it
is
clear
in
any
case
that
our
convictions
on
important
matters
are
not
the
result
of
knowledge
or
critical
thought
nor
it
may
be
added
are
they
often
dictated
by
supposed
most
of
them
are
in
the
proper
sense
of
that
word
we
do
not
form
them
ourselves
they
are
the
whisperings
of
the
voice
of
the
herd
we
have
in
the
last
analysis
no
responsibility
for
them
and
need
assume
none
they
are
not
really
our
own
ideas
but
those
of
others
no
more
well
informed
or
inspired
than
ourselves
who
have
got
them
in
the
same
careless
and
humiliating
manner
as
we
it
should
be
our
pride
to
revise
our
ideas
and
not
to
adhere
to
what
passes
for
respectable
opinion
for
such
opinion
can
frequently
be
shown
to
be
not
respectable
at
all
we
should
in
view
of
the
considerations
that
have
been
mentioned
resent
our
supine
credulity
as
an
english
writer
has
remarked
if
we
feared
the
entertaining
of
an
unverifiable
opinion
with
the
warmth
with
which
we
fear
using
the
wrong
implement
at
the
dinner
table
if
the
thought
of
holding
a
prejudice
disgusted
us
as
does
a
foul
disease
then
the
dangers
of
man
suggestibility
would
be
turned
into
advantages
the
purpose
of
this
essay
is
to
set
forth
briefly
the
way
in
which
the
notions
of
the
herd
have
been
accumulated
this
seems
to
me
the
best
easiest
and
least
invidious
educational
device
for
cultivating
a
proper
distrust
for
the
older
notions
on
which
we
still
continue
to
rely
the
real
reasons
which
explain
how
it
is
we
happen
to
hold
a
particular
belief
are
chiefly
historical
our
most
important
opinions
those
for
example
having
to
do
with
traditional
religious
and
moral
convictions
property
rights
patriotism
national
honor
the
state
and
indeed
all
the
assumed
foundations
of
society
are
as
i
have
already
suggested
rarely
the
result
of
reasoned
consideration
but
of
unthinking
absorption
from
the
social
environment
in
which
we
live
consequently
they
have
about
them
a
quality
of
elemental
certitude
and
we
especially
resent
doubt
or
criticism
cast
upon
them
so
long
however
as
we
revere
the
whisperings
of
the
herd
we
are
obviously
unable
to
examine
them
dispassionately
and
to
consider
to
what
extent
they
are
suited
to
the
novel
conditions
and
social
exigencies
in
which
we
find
ourselves
the
real
reasons
for
our
beliefs
by
making
clear
their
origins
and
history
can
do
much
to
dissipate
this
emotional
blockade
and
rid
us
of
our
prejudices
and
preconceptions
once
this
is
done
and
we
come
critically
to
examine
our
traditional
beliefs
we
may
well
find
some
of
them
sustained
by
experience
and
honest
reasoning
while
others
must
be
revised
to
meet
new
conditions
and
our
more
extended
knowledge
but
only
after
we
have
undertaken
such
a
critical
examination
in
the
light
of
experience
and
modern
knowledge
freed
from
any
feeling
of
primary
certitude
can
we
claim
that
the
good
are
also
the
real
reasons
for
our
opinions
i
do
not
flatter
myself
that
this
general
of
man
thought
through
the
ages
will
cure
myself
or
others
of
carelessness
in
adopting
ideas
or
of
unseemly
heat
in
defending
them
just
because
we
have
adopted
them
but
if
the
considerations
which
i
propose
to
recall
are
really
incorporated
into
our
thinking
and
are
permitted
to
establish
our
general
outlook
on
human
affairs
they
will
do
much
to
relieve
the
imaginary
obligation
we
feel
in
regard
to
traditional
sentiments
and
ideals
few
of
us
are
capable
of
engaging
in
creative
thought
but
some
of
us
can
at
least
come
to
distinguish
it
from
other
and
inferior
kinds
of
thought
and
accord
to
it
the
esteem
that
it
merits
as
the
greatest
treasure
of
the
past
and
the
only
hope
of
the
future
notes
the
john

lived
in

has
given
a
beautifully
honest
picture
of

doings
of

throw
myself
down
in
my

and
call
in
and
invite
god
and
his

thither
and
when
they
are
there
i
neglect
god
and
his

for
the
noise
of

for
the
rattling
of

for
the
whining
of

talk

in

posture
of

if

or
his

should
ask
me
when
i
thought
last
of
god
in
that
prayer
i
can
not
tell
sometimes
i
find
that
i
had
forgot
what
i
was
about
but
when
i
began
to

it
i
can
not
tell

the
savage
is
very
close
to
us
indeed
both
in
his
physical
and
mental
and
in
the
forms
of
his
social
life
tribal
society
is
virtually
delayed
civilization
and
the
savages
are
a
sort
of
contemporaneous
william
thomas
our
animal
heritage
the
nature
of
civilization
there
are
four
historical
layers
underlying
the
minds
of
civilized
men
the
animal
mind
the
child
mind
the
savage
mind
and
the
traditional
civilized
mind
we
are
all
animals
and
never
can
cease
to
be
we
were
all
children
at
our
most
impressionable
age
and
can
never
get
over
the
effects
of
that
our
human
ancestors
have
lived
in
savagery
during
practically
the
whole
existence
of
the
race
say
five
hundred
thousand
or
a
million
years
and
the
primitive
human
mind
is
ever
with
us
finally
we
are
all
born
into
an
elaborate
civilization
the
constant
pressure
of
which
we
can
by
no
means
escape
each
of
these
underlying
minds
has
its
special
sciences
and
appropriate
literatures
the
new
discipline
of
animal
or
comparative
psychology
deals
with
the
first
genetic
and
analytical
psychology
with
the
second
anthropology
ethnology
and
comparative
religion
with
the
third
and
the
history
of
philosophy
science
theology
and
literature
with
the
fourth
we
may
grow
beyond
these
underlying
minds
and
in
the
light
of
new
knowledge
we
may
criticize
their
findings
and
even
persuade
ourselves
that
we
have
successfully
transcended
them
but
if
we
are
fair
with
ourselves
we
shall
find
that
their
hold
on
us
is
really
inexorable
we
can
only
transcend
them
artificially
and
precariously
and
in
certain
highly
favorable
conditions
depression
anger
fear
or
ordinary
irritation
will
speedily
prove
the
insecurity
of
any
structure
that
we
manage
to
rear
on
our
fourfold
foundation
such
fundamental
and
vital
preoccupations
as
religion
love
war
and
the
chase
stir
impulses
that
lie
far
back
in
human
history
and
which
effectually
repudiate
the
cavilings
of
ratiocination
in
all
our
reveries
and
speculations
even
the
most
exacting
sophisticated
and
disillusioned
we
have
three
unsympathetic
companions
sticking
closer
than
a
brother
and
looking
on
with
jealous
impatience
our
wild
apish
progenitor
a
playful
or
peevish
baby
and
a
savage
we
may
at
any
moment
find
ourselves
overtaken
with
a
warm
sense
of
camaraderie
for
any
or
all
of
these
ancient
pals
of
ours
and
experience
infinite
relief
in
once
more
disporting
ourselves
with
them
as
of
yore
some
of
us
have
in
addition
a
greek
philosopher
or
man
of
letters
in
us
some
a
neoplatonic
mystic
some
a
mediaeval
monk
all
of
whom
have
learned
to
make
terms
with
their
older
playfellows
before
retracing
the
way
in
which
the
mind
as
we
now
find
it
in
intelligent
people
has
been
accumulated
we
may
take
time
to
try
to
see
what
civilization
is
and
why
man
alone
can
become
civilized
for
the
mind
has
expanded
with
civilization
and
without
civilization
there
would
i
venture
to
conjecture
have
been
no
human
mind
in
the
commonly
accepted
sense
of
that
term
it
is
now
generally
conceded
by
all
who
have
studied
the
varied
evidence
and
have
freed
themselves
from
ancient
prejudice
that
if
we
traced
back
our
human
lineage
far
enough
we
should
come
to
a
point
where
our
human
ancestors
had
no
civilization
and
lived
a
speechless
naked
houseless
fireless
and
toolless
life
similar
to
that
of
the
existing
primates
with
which
we
are
zoologically
closely
connected
this
is
one
of
the
most
fully
substantiated
of
historical
facts
and
one
which
we
can
never
neglect
in
our
attempts
to
explain
man
as
he
now
is
we
are
all
descended
from
the
lower
animals
we
are
furthermore
still
animals
with
not
only
an
animal
body
but
with
an
animal
mind
and
this
animal
body
and
animal
mind
are
the
original
foundations
on
which
even
the
most
subtle
and
refined
intellectual
life
must
perforce
rest
we
are
ready
to
classify
certain
of
our
most
essential
desires
as
brutish
hunger
and
thirst
the
urgence
of
sleep
and
especially
sexual
longing
we
know
of
blind
animal
rage
of
striking
biting
scratching
howling
and
snarling
of
irrational
fears
and
ignominious
flight
we
share
our
senses
with
the
higher
animals
have
eyes
and
ears
noses
and
tongues
much
like
theirs
heart
lungs
and
other
viscera
and
four
limbs
they
have
brains
which
stand
them
in
good
stead
although
their
heads
are
not
so
good
as
ours
but
when
one
speaks
of
the
animal
mind
he
should
think
of
still
other
resemblances
between
the
brute
and
man
all
animals
learn
even
the
most
humble
among
them
may
gain
something
from
experience
all
the
higher
animals
exhibit
curiosity
under
certain
circumstances
and
it
is
this
impulse
which
underlies
all
human
science
moreover
some
of
the
higher
animals
especially
the
apes
and
monkeys
are
much
given
to
fumbling
and
groping
they
are
restless
easily
bored
and
spontaneously
experimental
they
therefore
make
discoveries
quite
unconsciously
and
form
new
and
sometimes
profitable
habits
of
action
if
by
mere
fumbling
a
monkey
cat
or
dog
happens
on
a
way
to
secure
food
this
remunerative
line
of
conduct
will
occur
to
the
creature
when
he
feels
hungry
this
is
what
thorndike
has
named
learning
by
trial
and
error
it
might
better
be
called
fumbling
and
success
for
it
is
the
success
that
establishes
the
association
the
innate
curiosity
which
man
shares
with
his
uncivilized
zoological
relatives
is
the
native
impulse
that
leads
to
scientific
and
philosophical
speculation
and
the
original
fumbling
of
a
restless
ape
has
become
the
ordered
experimental
investigation
of
modern
times
a
creature
which
lacked
curiosity
and
had
no
tendency
to
fumble
could
never
have
developed
civilization
and
human
intelligence
but
why
did
man
alone
of
all
the
animals
become
civilized
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
although
it
has
often
escaped
writers
on
the
subject
all
animals
gain
a
certain
wisdom
with
age
and
experience
but
the
experience
of
one
ape
does
not
profit
another
learning
among
animals
below
man
is
not
and
one
dog
does
not
seem
to
learn
from
another
nor
one
ape
from
another
in
spite
of
the
widespread
misapprehension
in
this
regard
many
experiments
have
been
patiently
tried
in
recent
years
and
it
seems
to
be
pretty
well
established
that
the
monkey
learns
by
but
that
he
rarely
or
never
appears
to
he
does
not
learn
by
imitation
because
he
does
not
imitate
there
may
be
minor
exceptions
but
the
fact
that
apes
never
in
spite
of
a
bodily
equipment
nearly
human
become
in
the
least
degree
civilized
would
seem
to
show
that
the
accumulation
of
knowledge
or
dexterity
through
imitation
is
impossible
for
them
man
has
the
various
sense
organs
of
the
apes
and
their
extraordinary
power
of
manipulation
to
these
essentials
he
adds
a
brain
sufficiently
more
elaborate
than
that
of
the
chimpanzee
to
enable
him
to
do
something
that
the
ape
can
not
do
namely
see
things
clearly
enough
to
form
associations
through
imitation
we
can
imagine
the
manner
in
which
man
unwittingly
took
one
of
his
momentous
and
unprecedented
first
steps
in
civilization
some
restless
primeval
savage
might
find
himself
scraping
the
bark
off
a
stick
with
the
edge
of
a
stone
or
shell
and
finally
cutting
into
the
wood
and
bringing
the
thing
to
a
point
he
might
then
spy
an
animal
and
quite
without
reasoning
impulsively
make
a
thrust
with
the
stick
and
discover
that
it
pierced
the
creature
if
he
could
hold
these
various
elements
in
the
situation
sharpening
the
stick
and
using
it
he
would
have
made
an
invention
a
rude
spear
a
particularly
acute
bystander
might
comprehend
and
imitate
the
process
if
others
did
so
and
the
habit
was
established
in
the
tribe
so
that
it
became
traditional
and
was
transmitted
to
following
generations
the
process
of
civilization
would
have
begun
also
the
process
of
human
learning
which
is
noticing
distinctions
and
analyzing
situations
this
simple
process
of
sharpening
a
stick
would
involve
the
concepts
as
the
philosophers
say
of
a
tool
and
bark
and
a
point
and
an
artificial
weapon
but
ages
and
ages
were
to
elapse
before
the
botanist
would
distinguish
the
various
layers
which
constitute
the
bark
or
successive
experimenters
come
upon
the
idea
of
a
bayonet
to
take
the
place
of
the
spear
of
late
considerable
attention
has
been
given
to
the
question
of
man
original
uneducated
animal
nature
what
resources
has
he
as
a
mere
creature
independent
of
any
training
that
results
from
being
brought
up
in
some
sort
of
civilized
community
the
question
is
difficult
to
formulate
satisfactorily
and
still
more
difficult
to
answer
but
without
attempting
to
list
man
supposed
natural
instincts
we
must
assume
that
civilization
is
built
up
on
his
original
propensities
and
impulses
whatever
they
may
be
these
probably
remain
nearly
the
same
from
generation
to
generation
the
idea
formerly
held
that
the
civilization
of
our
ancestors
affects
our
original
nature
is
almost
completely
surrendered
are
all
born
wholly
if
a
group
of
infants
from
the
best
families
of
could
be
reared
by
apes
they
would
find
themselves
with
no
civilization
how
long
it
would
take
them
and
their
children
to
gain
what
now
passes
for
even
a
low
savage
culture
it
is
impossible
to
say
the
whole
arduous
task
would
have
to
be
performed
anew
and
it
might
not
take
place
at
all
unless
conditions
were
favorable
for
man
is
not
naturally
a
progressive
animal
he
shares
the
tendency
of
all
other
animal
tribes
just
to
pull
through
and
reproduce
his
kind
most
of
us
do
not
stop
to
think
of
the
conditions
of
an
animal
existence
when
we
read
the
descriptions
of
our
nature
as
given
by
william
james
mcdougall
or
even
thorndike
with
all
his
reservations
we
get
a
rather
impressive
idea
of
our
possibilities
not
a
picture
of
uncivilized
life
when
we
go
camping
we
think
that
we
are
deserting
civilization
forgetting
the
sophisticated
guides
and
the
pack
horses
laden
with
the
most
artificial
luxuries
many
of
which
would
not
have
been
available
even
a
hundred
years
ago
we
lead
the
simple
life
with
swedish
matches
brazilian
coffee
canadian
bacon
california
canned
peaches
magazine
rifles
jointed
fishing
rods
and
electric
flashlights
we
are
elaborately
clothed
and
can
discuss
views
or
lawrence
last
story
we
naïvely
imagine
we
are
returning
to
primitive
conditions
because
we
are
living
out
of
doors
or
sheltered
in
a
less
solid
abode
than
usual
and
have
to
go
to
the
brook
for
water
but
man
original
estate
was
as
hobbes
reflected
poor
nasty
brutish
and
short
to
live
like
an
animal
is
to
rely
upon
one
own
quite
naked
equipment
and
efforts
and
not
to
mind
getting
wet
or
cold
or
scratching
one
bare
legs
in
the
underbrush
one
would
have
to
eat
his
roots
and
seeds
quite
raw
and
gnaw
a
bird
as
a
cat
does
to
get
the
feel
of
uncivilized
life
let
us
recall
how
savages
with
the
comparatively
advanced
degree
of
culture
reached
by
our
native
indian
tribes
may
fall
to
when
really
hungry
in
the
journal
of
the
lewis
and
clark
expedition
there
is
an
account
of
the
killing
of
a
deer
by
the
white
men
hearing
of
this
the
shoshones
raced
wildly
to
the
spot
where
the
warm
and
bloody
entrails
had
been
thrown
out
and
ran
tumbling
over
one
another
like
famished
dogs
each
tore
away
whatever
part
he
could
and
instantly
began
to
eat
it
some
had
the
liver
some
the
kidneys
and
in
short
no
part
on
which
we
are
accustomed
to
look
with
disgust
escaped
them
one
of
them
who
had
seized
about
nine
feet
of
the
entrails
was
chewing
at
one
end
while
with
his
hand
he
was
diligently
clearing
his
way
by
discharging
the
contents
at
the
other
another
striking
example
of
simple
animal
procedure
is
given
in
the
same
journal
one
of
the
women
who
had
been
leading
two
of
our
pack
horses
halted
at
a
rivulet
about
a
mile
behind
and
sent
on
the
two
horses
by
a
female
friend
on
inquiring
of
cameahwait
the
cause
of
her
detention
he
answered
with
great
apparent
unconcern
that
she
had
just
stopped
to
lie
in
but
would
soon
overtake
us
in
fact
we
were
astonished
to
see
her
in
about
an
hour
time
come
on
with
her
infant
and
pass
us
on
her
way
to
the
camp
seemingly
in
perfect
health
this
is
the
simple
life
and
it
was
the
life
of
our
ancestors
before
civilization
began
it
had
been
the
best
kind
of
life
possible
in
all
the
preceding
aeons
of
the
world
history
without
civilization
it
would
be
the
existence
to
which
all
human
beings
now
on
the
earth
would
forthwith
revert
it
is
man
starting
point
but
what
about
the
mind
what
was
going
on
in
the
heads
of
our
untutored
forbears
we
are
apt
to
fall
into
the
error
of
supposing
that
because
they
had
human
brains
they
must
have
had
somewhat
the
same
kinds
of
ideas
and
made
the
same
kind
of
judgments
that
we
do
even
distinguished
philosophers
like
descartes
and
rousseau
made
this
mistake
this
assumption
will
not
stand
inspection
to
reach
back
in
imagination
to
the
really
primitive
mind
we
should
of
course
have
to
deduct
at
the
start
all
the
knowledge
and
all
the
discriminations
and
classifications
that
have
grown
up
as
a
result
of
our
education
and
our
immersion
from
infancy
in
a
highly
artificial
environment
then
we
must
recollect
that
our
primitive
ancestor
had
no
words
with
which
to
name
and
tell
about
things
he
was
speechless
his
fellows
knew
no
more
than
he
did
each
one
learned
during
his
lifetime
according
to
his
capacity
but
no
instruction
in
our
sense
of
the
word
was
possible
what
he
saw
and
heard
was
not
what
we
should
have
called
seeing
and
hearing
he
responded
to
situations
in
a
blind
and
impulsive
manner
with
no
clear
idea
of
them
in
short
he
must
have
much
as
a
wolf
or
bear
does
just
as
he
much
like
them
we
must
be
on
our
guard
against
accepting
the
prevalent
notions
of
even
the
animal
intellect
an
owl
may
look
quite
as
wise
as
a
judge
a
monkey
canary
or
collie
has
bright
eyes
and
seems
far
more
alert
than
most
of
the
people
we
see
on
the
street
car
a
squirrel
in
the
park
appears
to
be
looking
at
us
much
as
we
look
at
him
but
he
can
not
be
seeing
the
same
things
that
we
do
we
can
be
scarcely
more
to
him
than
a
vague
suggestion
of
peanuts
and
even
the
peanut
has
little
of
the
meaning
for
him
that
it
has
for
us
a
dog
perceives
a
and
may
be
induced
to
ride
in
it
but
his
idea
of
it
would
not
differ
from
that
of
an
ancient
carryall
except
mayhap
in
an
appreciative
distinction
between
the
odor
of
gasoline
and
that
of
the
stable
only
in
times
of
sickness
drunkenness
or
great
excitement
can
we
get
some
hint
in
ourselves
of
the
impulsive
responses
in
animals
free
from
human
sophistication
and
analysis
locke
thought
that
we
first
got
simple
ideas
and
then
combined
them
into
more
complex
conceptions
and
finally
into
generalizations
or
abstract
ideas
but
this
is
not
the
way
that
man
knowledge
arose
he
started
with
mere
impressions
of
general
situations
and
gradually
by
his
ability
to
handle
things
he
came
upon
distinctions
which
in
time
he
made
clearer
by
attaching
names
to
them
we
keep
repeating
this
process
when
we
learn
about
anything
the
typewriter
is
at
first
a
mere
mass
impression
and
only
gradually
and
imperfectly
do
most
of
us
distinguish
certain
of
its
parts
only
the
men
who
made
it
are
likely
to
realize
its
full
complexity
by
noting
and
assigning
names
to
all
the
levers
wheels
gears
bearings
controls
and
adjustments
john
stuart
mill
thought
that
the
chief
function
of
the
mind
was
making
inferences
but
making
distinctions
is
equally
fundamental
seeing
that
there
are
really
many
things
where
only
one
was
at
first
apparent
this
process
of
analysis
has
been
man
supreme
accomplishment
this
is
what
has
made
his
mind
grow
the
human
mind
has
then
been
built
up
through
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
by
gradual
accretions
and
laborious
accumulations
man
started
at
a
cultural
zero
and
had
to
find
out
everything
for
himself
or
rather
a
very
small
number
of
peculiarly
restless
and
adventurous
spirits
did
the
work
the
great
mass
of
humanity
has
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
increase
of
intelligence
except
to
act
as
its
medium
of
transfusion
and
perpetuation
creative
intelligence
is
confined
to
the
very
few
but
the
many
can
thoughtlessly
avail
themselves
of
the
more
obvious
achievements
of
those
who
are
exceptionally
highly
endowed
even
an
ape
will
fit
himself
into
a
civilized
environment
a
chimpanzee
can
be
taught
to
relish
bicycles
roller
skates
and
cigarettes
which
he
could
never
have
devised
can
not
understand
and
could
not
reproduce
even
so
with
mankind
most
of
us
could
not
have
devised
do
not
understand
and
consequently
could
not
reproduce
any
of
the
everyday
conveniences
and
luxuries
which
surround
us
few
of
us
could
make
an
electric
light
or
write
a
good
novel
to
read
by
it
or
paint
a
picture
for
it
to
shine
upon
professor
giddings
has
recently
asked
the
question
why
has
there
been
any
history
why
indeed
considering
that
the
good
and
respectable
is
usually
synonymous
with
the
ancient
routine
and
the
old
have
always
been
there
to
repress
the
young
such
heavy
words
of
approval
as
venerable
sanctified
and
revered
all
suggest
great
age
rather
than
fresh
discoveries
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
is
now
and
ever
shall
be
is
our
protest
against
being
disturbed
forced
to
think
or
to
change
our
habits
so
history
has
been
mainly
due
to
a
small
number
of
seers
really
gropers
and
monkeyers
whose
native
curiosity
outran
that
of
their
fellows
and
led
them
to
escape
here
and
there
from
the
sanctified
blindness
of
their
time
the
seer
is
simply
an
example
of
a
biologically
such
as
occurs
in
all
species
of
living
things
both
animal
and
vegetable
but
the
unusually
large
roses
in
our
gardens
the
swifter
horses
of
the
herd
and
the
cleverer
wolf
in
the
pack
have
no
means
of
influencing
their
fellows
as
a
result
of
their
peculiar
superiority
their
offspring
has
some
chance
of
sharing
to
some
degree
this
but
otherwise
things
will
go
on
as
before
whereas
the
singular
variation
represented
by
a
francis
a
dante
a
voltaire
or
a
darwin
may
permanently
and
for
ages
to
follow
change
somewhat
the
character
and
ambitions
of
innumerable
inferior
members
of
the
species
who
could
by
no
possibility
have
originated
anything
for
themselves
but
who
can
nevertheless
suffer
some
modification
as
a
result
of
the
teachings
of
others
this
illustrates
the
magical
and
unique
workings
of
culture
and
creative
intelligence
in
mankind
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
when
or
where
the
first
contribution
to
civilization
was
made
and
with
it
a
start
on
the
arduous
building
of
the
mind
there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
the
men
who
first
transcended
the
animal
mind
were
of
inferior
mental
capacity
to
our
own
but
even
if
man
emerging
from
his
animal
estate
had
had
on
the
average
quite
as
good
a
brain
as
those
with
which
we
are
now
familiar
i
suspect
that
the
extraordinarily
slow
and
hazardous
process
of
accumulating
modern
civilization
would
not
have
been
greatly
shortened
mankind
is
lethargic
easily
pledged
to
routine
timid
suspicious
of
innovation
that
is
his
nature
he
is
only
artificially
partially
and
very
recently
progressive
he
has
spent
almost
his
whole
existence
as
a
savage
hunter
and
in
that
state
of
ignorance
he
illustrated
on
a
magnificent
scale
all
the
inherent
weaknesses
of
the
human
mind
our
savage
mind
should
we
arrange
our
present
beliefs
and
opinions
on
the
basis
of
their
age
we
should
find
that
some
of
them
were
very
very
old
going
back
to
primitive
man
others
were
derived
from
the
greeks
many
more
of
them
would
prove
to
come
directly
from
the
middle
ages
while
certain
others
in
our
stock
were
unknown
until
natural
science
began
to
develop
in
a
new
form
about
three
hundred
years
ago
the
idea
that
man
has
a
soul
or
double
which
survives
the
death
of
the
body
is
very
ancient
indeed
and
is
accepted
by
most
savages
such
confidence
as
we
have
in
the
liberal
arts
metaphysics
and
formal
logic
goes
back
to
the
greek
thinkers
our
religious
ideas
and
our
standards
of
sexual
conduct
are
predominantly
mediaeval
in
their
presuppositions
our
notions
of
electricity
and
disease
germs
are
of
course
recent
in
origin
the
result
of
painful
and
prolonged
research
which
involved
the
rejection
of
a
vast
number
of
older
notions
sanctioned
by
immemorial
acceptance
general
those
ideas
which
are
still
almost
universally
accepted
in
regard
to
man
nature
his
proper
conduct
and
his
relations
to
god
and
his
fellows
are
far
more
ancient
and
far
less
critical
than
those
which
have
to
do
with
the
movement
of
the
stars
the
stratification
of
the
rocks
and
the
life
of
plants
and
nothing
is
more
essential
in
our
attempt
to
escape
from
the
bondage
of
consecrated
ideas
than
to
get
a
vivid
notion
of
human
achievement
in
its
proper
historical
perspective
in
order
to
do
this
let
us
imagine
the
whole
gradual
and
laborious
attainments
of
mankind
compressed
into
the
compass
of
a
single
lifetime
let
us
assume
that
a
single
generation
of
men
have
in
fifty
years
managed
to
accumulate
all
that
now
passes
for
civilization
they
would
have
to
start
as
all
individuals
do
absolutely
uncivilized
and
their
task
would
be
to
recapitulate
what
has
occupied
the
race
for
let
us
guess
at
least
five
hundred
thousand
years
each
year
in
the
life
of
a
generation
would
therefore
correspond
to
ten
thousand
years
in
the
progress
of
the
race
on
this
scale
it
would
require
years
to
reach
a
point
of
intelligence
which
would
enable
our
generation
to
give
up
their
ancient
and
inveterate
habits
of
wandering
hunters
and
settle
down
here
and
there
to
till
the
ground
harvest
their
crops
domesticate
animals
and
weave
their
rough
garments
six
months
later
or
half
through
the
fiftieth
year
some
of
them
in
a
particularly
favorable
situation
would
have
invented
writing
and
thus
established
a
new
and
wonderful
means
of
spreading
and
perpetuating
civilization
three
months
later
another
group
would
have
carried
literature
art
and
philosophy
to
a
high
degree
of
refinement
and
set
standards
for
the
succeeding
weeks
for
two
months
our
generation
would
have
been
living
under
the
blessings
of
christianity
the
printing
press
would
be
but
a
fortnight
old
and
they
would
not
have
had
the
steam
engine
for
quite
a
week
for
two
or
three
days
they
would
have
been
hastening
about
the

yesterday
would
they

possibilities
of

within
the
last
few
hours
they

applied
their

to
the
prosecution
of
a
magnificent
war
on
the
scale
befitting
their
high
ideals
and
new
resources
this
is
not
so
strange
for
only
a
week
ago
they
were
burning
and
burying
alive
those
who
differed
from
the
ruling
party
in
regard
to
salvation
eviscerating
in

those
who
had
new
ideas
of
government
and
hanging
old
women
who
were
accused
of
traffic
with
the
devil
all
of
them
had
been
no
better
than
vagrant
savages
a
year
before
their
fuller
knowledge
was
altogether
too
recent
to
have
gone
very
deep
and
they
had
many
institutions
and
many
leaders
dedicated
to
the
perpetuation
of
outworn
notions
which
would
otherwise
have
disappeared
until
recently
changes
had
taken
place
so
slowly
and
so
insensibly
that
only
a
very
few
persons
could
be
expected
to
realize
that
not
a
few
of
the
beliefs
that
were
accepted
as
eternal
verities
were
due
to
the
inevitable
misunderstandings
of
a
savage
in
speaking
of
the
savage
or
primitive
mind
we
are
of
course
using
a
very
clumsy
expression
we
shall
employ
the
term
nevertheless
to
indicate
the
characteristics
of
the
human
mind
when
there
was
as
yet
no
writing
no
organized
industry
or
mechanical
arts
no
money
no
important
specialization
of
function
except
between
the
sexes
no
settled
life
in
large
communities
the
period
so
described
covers
all
but
about
five
or
six
thousand
of
the
half
million
to
a
million
years
that
man
has
existed
on
the
earth
there
are
no
chronicles
to
tell
us
the
story
of
those
long
centuries
some
inferences
can
be
made
from
the
increasing
artfulness
and
variety
of
the
flint
weapons
and
tools
which
we
find
but
the
stone
weapons
which
have
come
down
to
us
even
in
their
crudest
forms
eoliths
are
very
far
from
representing
the
earliest
achievements
of
man
in
the
accumulation
of
culture
those
dim
remote
cycles
must
have
been
full
of
great
but
inconspicuous
originators
who
laid
the
foundations
of
civilization
in
discoveries
and
achievements
so
long
taken
for
granted
that
we
do
not
realize
that
they
ever
had
to
be
made
at
all
since
man
is
descended
from
less
highly
endowed
animals
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
the
was
in
a
state
of
animal
ignorance
he
started
with
no
more
than
an
ape
is
able
to
know
he
had
to
learn
everything
for
himself
as
he
had
no
one
to
teach
him
the
tricks
that
apes
and
children
can
be
taught
by
sophisticated
human
beings
he
was
necessarily
and
began
as
we
have
seen
in
a
state
of
ignorance
beyond
anything
we
can
readily
conceive
he
lived
naked
and
speechless
in
the
woods
or
wandered
over
the
plains
without
artificial
shelter
or
any
way
of
cooking
his
food
he
subsisted
on
raw
fruit
berries
roots
insects
and
such
animals
as
he
could
strike
down
or
pick
up
dead
his
mind
must
have
corresponded
with
his
brutish
state
he
must
at
the
first
have
learned
just
as
his
animal
relatives
learn
by
fumbling
and
by
forming
accidental
associations
he
had
impulses
and
such
sagacity
as
he
individually
derived
from
experience
but
no
heritage
of
knowledge
accumulated
by
the
group
and
transmitted
by
education
this
heritage
had
to
be
constructed
on
potentialities
of
mankind
in
this
extremely
primitive
condition
we
have
no
traces
there
could
indeed
be
no
traces
all
savages
of
the
present
day
or
of
whom
we
have
any
record
represent
a
relatively
highly
developed
traditional
culture
with
elaborate
languages
myths
and
artificial
customs
which
it
probably
took
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
to
accumulate
man
in
a
state
of
nature
is
only
a
presupposition
but
a
presupposition
which
is
forced
upon
us
by
compelling
evidence
conjectural
and
inferential
though
it
is
on
a
geological
time
scale
we
are
still
close
to
savagery
and
it
is
inevitable
that
the
ideas
and
customs
and
sentiments
of
savagery
should
have
become
so
ingrained
that
they
may
have
actually
affected
man
nature
by
natural
selection
through
the
survival
of
those
who
most
completely
adjusted
themselves
to
the
uncritical
culture
which
prevailed
but
in
any
case
it
is
certain
as
many
anthropologists
have
pointed
out
that
customs
savage
ideas
and
primitive
sentiments
have
continued
to
form
an
important
part
of
our
own
culture
down
even
to
the
present
day
we
are
met
thus
with
the
necessity
of
reckoning
with
this
inveterate
element
in
our
present
thought
and
customs
much
of
the
data
that
we
have
regarding
primitive
man
has
been
accumulated
in
recent
times
for
the
most
part
as
a
result
of
the
study
of
simple
peoples
these
differ
greatly
in
their
habits
and
myths
but
some
salient
common
traits
emerge
which
cast
light
on
the
spontaneous
workings
of
the
human
mind
when
unaffected
by
the
sophistications
of
a
highly
elaborate
civilization
at
the
start
man
had
to
distinguish
himself
from
the
group
to
which
he
belonged
and
say
i
am
i
this
is
not
an
idea
given
by
nature
there
are
evidences
that
the
earlier
religious
notions
were
not
based
on
individuality
but
rather
on
the
virtue
which
objects
had
that
is
their
potency
to
do
things
only
later
did
the
animistic
belief
in
the
personalities
of
men
animals
and
the
forces
of
nature
appear
when
man
discovered
his
own
individuality
he
spontaneously
ascribed
the
same
type
of
individuality
and
purpose
to
animals
and
plants
to
the
wind
and
the
thunder
this
exhibits
one
of
the
most
noxious
tendencies
of
the
mind
namely
personification
it
is
one
of
the
most
virulent
enemies
of
clear
thinking
we
speak
of
the
spirit
of
the
reformation
or
the
spirit
of
revolt
or
the
spirit
of
disorder
and
anarchy
the
papers
tell
us
that
berlin
says
london
says
uncle
sam
so
decides
john
bull
is
disgruntled
now
whether
or
no
there
are
such
things
as
spirits
berlin
and
london
have
no
souls
and
uncle
sam
is
as
mythical
as
the
great
god
pan
sometimes
this
regression
to
the
savage
is
harmless
but
when
a
newspaper
states
that
germany
is
as
militaristic
as
ever
on
the
ground
that
some
insolent
prussian
lieutenant
says
that
german
armies
will
occupy
paris
within
five
years
we
have
an
example
of
animism
which
in
a
society
farther
removed
from
savagery
than
ours
might
be
deemed
a
high
crime
and
misdemeanor
chemists
and
physicians
have
given
up
talking
of
spirits
but
in
discussing
social
and
economic
questions
we
are
still
victimized
by
the
primitive
animistic
tendencies
of
the
mind
the
dream
has
had
a
great
influence
in
the
building
up
of
the
mind
our
ideas
especially
our
religious
beliefs
would
have
had
quite
another
history
had
men
been
dreamless
for
it
was
not
merely
his
shadow
and
his
reflection
in
the
water
that
led
man
to
imagine
souls
and
doubles
but
the
visions
of
the
night
as
his
body
lay
quiet
in
sleep
he
found
himself
wandering
in
distant
places
sometimes
he
was
visited
by
the
dead
so
it
was
clear
that
the
body
had
an
inhabitant
who
was
not
necessarily
bound
to
it
who
could
desert
it
from
time
to
time
during
life
and
who
continued
to
exist
and
interest
itself
in
human
affairs
after
death
whole
civilizations
and
religions
and
vast
theological
speculations
have
been
dominated
by
this
savage
inference
it
is
true
that
in
very
recent
times
since
plato
let
us
say
other
reasons
have
been
urged
for
believing
in
the
soul
and
its
immortality
but
the
idea
appears
to
have
got
its
firm
footing
in
savage
logic
it
is
a
primitive
inference
however
it
may
later
have
been
revised
rationalized
and
ennobled
the
taboo
the
forbidden
thing
of
savage
life
is
another
thing
very
elementary
in
man
he
had
tendencies
to
fall
into
habits
and
establish
inhibitions
for
reasons
that
he
either
did
not
discover
or
easily
forgot
these
became
fixed
and
sacred
to
him
and
any
departure
from
them
filled
him
with
dread
sometimes
the
prohibition
might
have
some
reasonable
justification
sometimes
it
might
seem
wholly
absurd
and
even
a
great
nuisance
but
that
made
no
difference
in
its
binding
force
for
example
pork
was
taboo
among
the
ancient
hebrews
no
one
can
say
why
but
none
of
the
modern
justifications
for
abstaining
from
that
particular
kind
of
meat
would
have
counted
in
early
jewish
times
it
is
not
improbable
that
it
was
the
original
veneration
for
the
boar
and
not
an
abhorrence
of
him
that
led
to
the
prohibition
the
modern
principle
is
too
often
only
a
new
form
of
the
ancient
taboo
rather
than
an
enlightened
rule
of
conduct
the
person
who
justifies
himself
by
saying
that
he
holds
certain
beliefs
or
acts
in
a
certain
manner
on
principle
and
yet
refuses
to
examine
the
basis
and
expediency
of
his
principle
introduces
into
his
thinking
and
conduct
an
irrational
mystical
element
similar
to
that
which
characterized
savage
prohibitions
principles
unintelligently
urged
make
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
the
free
consideration
of
social
readjustment
for
they
are
frequently
as
recalcitrant
and
obscurantist
as
the
primitive
taboo
and
are
really
scarcely
more
than
an
excuse
for
refusing
to
reconsider
one
convictions
and
conduct
the
psychological
conditions
lying
back
of
both
taboo
and
this
sort
of
principle
are
essentially
the
same
we
find
in
savage
thought
a
sort
of
intensified
and
generalized
taboo
in
the
classification
of
things
as
clean
and
unclean
and
in
the
conceptions
of
the
sacred
these
are
really
expressions
of
profound
and
persistent
traits
in
the
uncritical
mind
and
can
only
be
overcome
by
carefully
cultivated
criticism
they
are
the
result
of
our
natural
timidity
and
the
constant
dread
lest
we
find
ourselves
treading
on
holy
dangerous
ground
when
they
are
intrenched
in
the
mind
we
can
not
expect
to
think
freely
and
fairly
for
they
effectually
stop
argument
if
a
thing
is
held
to
be
sacred
it
is
the
center
of
what
may
be
called
a
defense
complex
and
a
reasonable
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
case
will
not
be
tolerated
when
an
issue
is
declared
to
be
a
moral
one
for
example
the
prohibition
of
strong
drink
an
emotional
state
is
implied
which
makes
reasonable
compromise
and
adjustment
impossible
for
moral
is
a
word
on
somewhat
the
same
plane
as
sacred
and
has
much
the
same
qualities
and
similar
effects
on
thinking
in
dealing
with
the
relations
of
the
sexes
the
terms
pure
and
impure
introduce
mystic
and
irrational
moods
alien
to
clear
analysis
and
reasonable
readjustments
those
who
have
studied
the
characteristics
of
savage
life
are
always
struck
by
its
deadly
conservatism
its
needless
restraints
on
the
freedom
of
the
individual
and
its
hopeless
routine
man

to
go
on

to
generation

as
nearly
as
may
be
the
life
of
his
forbears
changes
have
to
be
forced
upon
him
by
hard
experience
and
he
is
ever
prone
to
find
excuses
for
slipping
back
into
older
habits
for
these
are
likely
to
be
simpler
less
critical
more
spontaneous
more
closely
akin
in
short
to
his
animal
and
primitive
promptings
one
who
prides
himself
on
his
conservatism
on
the
ground
that
man
is
naturally
an
anarchic
and
disorderly
creature
who
is
held
in
check
by
the
tory
is
almost
exactly
reversing
the
truth
mankind
is
conservative
by
nature
and
readily
generates
restraints
on
himself
and
obstacles
to
change
which
have
served
to
keep
him
in
a
state
of
savagery
during
almost
his
whole
existence
on
the
earth
and
which
still
perpetuate
all
sorts
of
primitive
barbarism
in
modern
society
the
conservative
on
principle
is
therefore
a
most
unmistakably
primitive
person
in
his
attitude
his
only
advance
beyond
the
savage
mood
lies
in
the
specious
reasons
he
is
able
to
advance
for
remaining
of
the
same
mind

we
vaguely
call
a
radical

a
very
recent
product

circumstances

in
general
and
to
the
highly
artificial
system
of
censorship
and
restraints
which
they
impose
in
their
own
interests
on
his
natural
impulses
must
surely
have
a
permanent
influence

was
of
a
very
great
age
said
o

you
hellenes
are

children
and
there
was
never
an
old
man
who
was
a
hellene

asked
him

he

the
truth
is
that
we
are
far
more
likely
to
underrate
the
originality
of
the
greeks
than
to
exaggerate
it
and
we
do
not
always
remember
the
very
short
time
they
took
to
lay
down
the
lines
scientific
inquiry
has
followed
ever
john
burnet
beginning
of
critical
thinking
the
egyptians
were
the
first
people
so
far
as
we
know
who
invented
a
highly
artificial
method
of
writing
about
five
thousand
years
ago
and
began
to
devise
new
arts
beyond
those
of
their
barbarous
predecessors
they
developed
painting
and
architecture
navigation
and
various
ingenious
industries
they
worked
in
glass
and
enamels
and
began
the
use
of
copper
and
so
introduced
metal
into
human
affairs
but
in
spite
of
their
extraordinary
advance
in
practical
knowledge
they
remained
very
primitive
in
their
beliefs
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
peoples
of
mesopotamia
and
of
the
western
asiatic
nations
in
general
just
as
in
our
own
day
the
practical
arts
have
got
a
long
start
compared
with
the
revision
of
beliefs
in
regard
to
man
and
the
gods
the
peculiar
opinions
of
the
egyptians
do
not
enter
directly
into
our
intellectual
heritage
but
some
of
the
fundamental
religious
ideas
which
developed
in
western
asia
have
through
the
veneration
for
the
hebrew
scriptures
become
part
and
parcel
of
our
ways
of
thinking
to
the
greeks
however
we
are
intellectually
under
heavy
obligation
the
literature
of
the
greeks
in
such
fragments
as
escaped
destruction
was
destined
along
with
the
hebrew
scriptures
to
exercise
an
incalculable
influence
in
the
formation
of
our
modern
civilized
minds
these
two
dominating
literary
heritages
originated
about
the
same
time
day
before
yesterday
viewed
in
the
perspective
of
our
race
history
previous
to
the
greek
civilization
books
had
played
no
great
part
in
the
development
dissemination
and
transmission
of
culture
from
generation
to
generation
now
they
were
to
become
a
cardinal
force
in
advancing
and
retarding
the
mind
expansion
it
required
about
a
thousand
years
for
the
greek
shepherds
from
the
pastures
of
the
danube
to
assimilate
the
culture
of
the
highly
civilized
regions
in
which
they
first
appeared
as
barbarian
destroyers
they
accepted
the
industrial
arts
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
adopted
the
phoenician
alphabet
and
emulated
the
phoenician
merchant
by
the
seventh
century
before
our
era
they
had
towns
colonies
and
commerce
with
much
stimulating
running
hither
and
thither
we
get
our
first
traces
of
new
intellectual
enterprise
in
the
ionian
cities
especially
miletus
and
in
the
italian
colonies
of
the
greeks
only
later
did
athens
become
the
unrivaled
center
in
a
marvelous
outflowering
of
the
human
intelligence
it
is
a
delicate
task
to
summarize
what
we
owe
to
the
greeks
leaving
aside
their
supreme
achievements
in
literature
and
art
we
can
consider
only
very
briefly
the
general
scope
and
nature
of
their
thinking
as
it
relates
most
closely
to
our
theme
the
chief
strength
of
the
greeks
lay
in
their
freedom
from
hampering
intellectual
tradition
they
had
no
venerated
classics
no
holy
books
no
dead
languages
to
master
no
authorities
to
check
their
free
speculation
as
lord
bacon
reminds
us
they
had
no
antiquity
of
knowledge
and
no
knowledge
of
antiquity
a
modern
classicist
would
have
been
a
forlorn
outlander
in
ancient
athens
with
no
books
in
a
forgotten
tongue
no
obsolete
inflections
to
impose
upon
reluctant
youth
he
would
have
had
to
use
the
everyday
speech
of
the
and
fuller
for
a
long
time
no
technical
words
were
invented
to
give
aloofness
and
seeming
precision
to
philosophic
and
scientific
discussion
aristotle
was
the
first
to
use
words
incomprehensible
to
the
average
citizen
it
was
in
these
conditions
that
the
possibilities
of
human
criticism
first
showed
themselves
the
primitive
notions
of
man
of
the
gods
and
of
the
workings
of
natural
forces
began
to
be
overhauled
on
an
entirely
new
scale
intelligence
developed
rapidly
as
exceptionally
bold
individuals
came
to
have
their
suspicions
of
simple
spontaneous
and
ancient
ways
of
looking
at
things
ultimately
there
came
men
who
professed
to
doubt
everything
as
abelard
long
after
put
it
by
doubting
we
come
to
question
and
by
seeking
we
may
come
upon
the
truth
but
man
is
by
nature
credulous
he
is
victimized
by
first
impressions
from
which
he
can
only
escape
with
great
difficulty
he
resents
criticism
of
accepted
and
familiar
ideas
as
he
resents
any
unwelcome
disturbance
of
routine
so
criticism
is
against
nature
for
it
conflicts
with
the
smooth
workings
of
our
more
primitive
minds
those
of
the
child
and
the
savage
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
the
greek
people
were
no
exception
in
this
matter
anaxagoras
and
aristotle
were
banished
for
thinking
as
they
did
euripides
was
an
object
of
abhorrence
to
the
conservative
of
his
day
and
socrates
was
actually
executed
for
his
godless
teachings
the
greek
thinkers
furnish
the
first
instance
of
intellectual
freedom
of
the
and
vigor
of
criticism
which
is
most
touchingly
illustrated
in
the
honest
of
socrates
discovered
skepticism
in
the
higher
and
proper
significance
of
the
word
and
this
was
their
supreme
contribution
to
human
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
early
greek
skepticism
was
the
discovery
of
xenophanes
that
man
created
the
gods
in
his
own
image
he
looked
about
him
observed
the
current
conceptions
of
the
gods
compared
those
of
different
peoples
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
way
in
which
a
tribe
pictured
its
gods
was
not
the
outcome
of
any
knowledge
of
how
they
really
looked
and
whether
they
had
black
eyes
or
blue
but
was
a
reflection
of
the
familiarly
human
if
the
lions
had
gods
they
would
have
the
shape
of
their
worshipers
no
more
fundamentally
shocking
revelation
was
ever
made
than
this
for
it
shook
the
very
foundations
of
religious
belief
the
home
life
on
olympus
as
described
in
homer
was
too
scandalous
to
escape
the
attention
of
the
thoughtful
and
no
later
christian
could
have
denounced
the
demoralizing
influence
of
the
current
religious
beliefs
in
hotter
indignation
than
did
plato
to
judge
from
the
reflection
of
greek
thought
which
we
find
in
lucretius
and
cicero
none
of
the
primitive
religious
beliefs
escaped
mordant
criticism
the
second
great
discovery
of
the
greek
thinkers
was
they
did
not
have
the
name
which
originated
long
after
in
quite
an
absurd
fashion
but
they
reveled
in
the
thing
nowadays
metaphysics
is
revered
by
some
as
our
noblest
effort
to
reach
the
highest
truth
and
scorned
by
others
as
the
silliest
of
chases
i
am
inclined
to
rate
it
like
smoking
as
a
highly
gratifying
indulgence
to
those
who
like
it
and
as
indulgences
go
relatively
innocent
the
greeks
found
that
the
mind
could
carry
on
an
absorbing
game
with
itself
we
all
engage
in
reveries
and
fantasies
of
a
homely
everyday
type
concerned
with
our
desires
or
resentments
but
the
fantasy
of
the
metaphysician
busies
itself
with
conceptions
abstractions
distinctions
hypotheses
postulates
and
logical
inferences
having
made
certain
postulates
or
hypotheses
he
finds
new
conclusions
which
he
follows
in
a
seemingly
convincing
manner
this
gives
him
the
delightful
emotion
of
pursuing
truth
something
as
the
simple
man
pursues
a
maiden
only
truth
is
more
elusive
than
the
maiden
and
may
continue
to
beckon
her
follower
for
long
years
no
matter
how
gray
and
doddering
he
may
become
let
me
give
two
examples
of
metaphysical
reasoning
we
have
an
idea
of
an
omnipotent
and
perfect
being
we
are
incapable
knowing
as
we
do
only
imperfect
things
of
framing
such
an
idea
for
ourselves
so
it
must
have
been
given
us
by
the
being
himself
and
perfection
must
include
existence
so
god
must
exist
this
was
good
enough
for
anselm
and
for
descartes
who
went
on
to
build
a
whole
closely
concatenated
philosophical
system
on
this
foundation
to
them
the
logic
seemed
irrefragable
to
the
modern
student
of
comparative
religion
even
to
kant
himself
a
metaphysician
there
was
nothing
whatsoever
in
it
but
an
illustration
of
the
native
operations
of
a
mind
that
has
made
a
wholly
gratuitous
hypothesis
and
is
victimized
by
an
orderly
series
of
spontaneous
associations
a
second
example
of
metaphysics
may
be
found
in
the
doctrines
of
the
eleatic
philosophers
who
early
appeared
in
the
greek
colonies
on
the
coast
of
italy
and
thought
hard
about
space
and
motion
empty
space
seemed
as
good
as
nothing
and
as
nothing
could
not
be
said
to
exist
space
must
be
an
illusion
and
as
motion
implied
space
in
which
to
take
place
there
could
be
no
motion
so
all
things
were
really
perfectly
compact
and
at
rest
and
all
our
impressions
of
change
were
the
illusions
of
the
thoughtless
and
the
since
one
of
the
chief
satisfactions
of
the
metaphysicians
is
to
get
away
from
the
welter
of
our
mutable
world
into
a
realm
of
assurance
this
doctrine
exercised
a
great
fascination
over
many
minds
the
eleatic
conviction
of
unchanging
stability
received
a
new
form
in
plato
doctrine
of
eternal
ideas
and
later
developed
into
the
comforting
conception
of
the
absolute
in
which
logical
and
souls
have
sought
refuge
from
the
times
of
plotinus
to
those
of
josiah
royce
but
there
was
one
group
of
greek
thinkers
whose
general
notions
of
natural
operations
correspond
in
a
striking
manner
to
the
conclusions
of
the
most
recent
science
these
were
the
epicureans
democritus
was
in
no
way
a
modern
experimental
scientist
but
he
met
the
eleatic
metaphysics
with
another
set
of
speculative
considerations
which
happened
to
be
nearer
what
is
now
regarded
as
the
truth
than
theirs
he
rejected
the
eleatic
decisions
against
the
reality
of
space
and
motion
on
the
ground
that
since
motion
obviously
took
place
the
void
must
be
a
reality
even
if
the
metaphysician
could
not
conceive
it
he
hit
upon
the
notion
that
all
things
were
composed
of
minute
indestructible
particles
or
atoms
of
fixed
kinds
given
motion
and
sufficient
time
these
might
by
fortuitous
concourse
make
all
possible
combinations
and
it
was
one
of
these
combinations
which
we
call
the
world
as
we
find
it
for
the
atoms
of
various
shapes
were
inherently
capable
of
making
up
all
material
things
even
the
soul
of
man
and
the
gods
themselves
there
was
no
permanence
anywhere
all
was
no
more
than
the
shifting
accidental
and
fleeting
combinations
of
the
permanent
atoms
of
which
the
cosmos
was
composed
this
doctrine
was
accepted
by
the
noble
epicurus
and
his
school
and
is
delivered
to
us
in
the
immortal
poem
of
lucretius
on
the
nature
of
things
the
epicureans
believed
the
gods
to
exist
because
like
anselm
and
descartes
they
thought
we
had
an
innate
idea
of
them
but
the
divine
beings
led
a
life
of
elegant
ease
and
took
no
account
of
man
neither
his
supplications
nor
his
sacrifices
nor
his
blasphemies
ever
disturbed
their
calm
moreover
the
human
soul
was
dissipated
at
death
so
the
epicureans
flattered
themselves
that
they
had
delivered
man
from
his
two
chief
apprehensions
the
fear
of
the
gods
and
the
fear
of
death
for
as
lucretius
says
he
who
understands
the
real
nature
of
things
will
see
that
both
are
the
illusions
of
ignorance
thus
one
school
of
greek
thinkers
attained
to
a
complete
rejection
of
religious
beliefs
in
the
name
of
natural
science
influence
of
plato
and
aristotle
in
plato
we
have
at
once
the
skepticism
and
the
metaphysics
of
his
contemporaries
he
has
had
his
followers
down
through
the
ages
some
of
whom
carried
his
skepticism
to
its
utmost
bounds
while
others
availed
themselves
of
his
metaphysics
to
rear
a
system
of
arrogant
mystical
dogmatism
he
put
his
speculations
in
the
form
of
dialogues
ostensible
discussions
in
the
market
place
or
the
houses
of
philosophic
athenians
the
greek
word
for
logic
is
dialectic
which
really
means
discussion
argumentation
in
the
interest
of
fuller
analysis
with
the
hope
of
more
critical
conclusions
the
dialogues
are
the
drama
of
his
day
employed
in
plato
magical
hand
as
a
vehicle
of
discursive
reason
of
late
we
have
in
ibsen
shaw
brieux
and
galsworthy
the
old
expedient
applied
to
the
consideration
of
social
perplexities
and
contradictions
the
dialogue
is
indecisive
in
its
outcome
it
does
not
lend
itself
to
dogmatic
conclusions
and
systematic
presentation
but
exposes
the
intricacy
of
all
important
questions
and
the
inevitable
conflict
of
views
which
may
seem
altogether
irreconcilable
we
much
need
to
encourage
and
elaborate
opportunities
for
profitable
discussion
we
should
revert
to
the
dialectic
of
the
athenian
agora
and
make
it
a
chosen
instrument
for
clarifying
and
directing
our
thinking
plato
indecision
and
urbane
is
called
irony
now
irony
is
seriousness
without
solemnity
it
assumes
that
man
is
a
animal
and
that
no
treatment
of
his
affairs
can
be
appropriate
which
gives
him
a
consistency
and
dignity
which
he
does
not
possess
he
is
always
a
child
and
a
savage
he
is
the
victim
of
conflicting
desires
and
hidden
yearnings
he
may
talk
like
a
sentimental
idealist
and
act
like
a
brute
the
same
person
will
devote
anxious
years
to
the
invention
of
high
explosives
and
then
give
his
fortune
to
the
promotion
of
peace
we
devise
the
most
exquisite
machinery
for
blowing
our
neighbors
to
pieces
and
then
display
our
highest
skill
and
organization
in
trying
to
patch
together
such
as
offer
hope
of
being
mended
our
nature
forbids
us
to
make
a
definite
choice
between
the
machine
gun
and
the
red
cross
nurse
so
we
use
the
one
to
keep
the
other
busy
human
thought
and
conduct
can
only
be
treated
broadly
and
truly
in
a
mood
of
tolerant
irony
it
belies
the
logical
precision
of
the
humorless
writer
on
politics
and
ethics
whose
works
rarely
deal
with
man
at
all
but
are
a
stupid
form
of
metaphysics
plato
made
terms
with
the
welter
of
things
but
sought
relief
in
the
conception
of
supernal
models
eternal
in
the
heavens
after
which
all
things
were
imperfectly
fashioned
he
confessed
that
he
could
not
bear
to
accept
a
world
which
was
like
a
leaky
pot
or
a
man
running
at
the
nose
in
short
he
ascribed
the
highest
form
of
existence
to
ideals
and
abstractions
this
was
a
new
and
sophisticated
republication
of
savage
animism
it
invited
lesser
minds
than
his
to
indulge
in
all
sorts
of
noble
vagueness
and
impertinent
jargon
which
continue
to
curse
our
popular
discussions
of
human
affairs
he
consecrated
one
of
the
chief
foibles
of
the
human
mind
and
elevated
it
to
a
religion
ever
since
his
time
men
have
discussed
the
import
of
names
are
there
such
things
as
love
friendship
and
honor
or
are
there
only
lovely
things
friendly
emotions
in
this
individual
and
that
deeds
which
we
may
according
to
our
standards
pronounce
honorable
or
dishonorable
if
you
believe
in
beauty
truth
and
love
you
are
a
platonist
if
you
believe
that
there
are
only
individual
instances
and
illustrations
of
various
classified
emotions
and
desires
and
acts
and
that
abstractions
are
only
the
inevitable
categories
of
thought
you
would
in
the
middle
ages
have
been
called
a
nominalist
this
matter
merits
a
long
discussion
but
one
can
test
any
book
or
newspaper
editorial
at
his
leisure
and
see
whether
the
writer
puts
you
off
with
abstractions
americanism
bolshevism
public
welfare
liberty
national
honor
religion
morality
good
taste
rights
of
man
science
reason
error
or
on
the
other
hand
casts
some
light
on
actual
human
complications
i
do
not
mean
of
course
that
we
can
get
along
without
the
use
of
abstract
and
general
terms
in
our
thinking
and
speaking
but
we
should
be
on
our
constant
guard
against
viewing
them
as
forces
and
attributing
to
them
the
vigor
of
personality
animism
is
as
already
explained
a
pitfall
which
is
always
yawning
before
us
and
into
which
we
are
sure

plunge
unless
we
are
ever
watchful
platonism
is
its
most
amiable
and
complete
disguise
previous
to
aristotle
greek
thought
had
been
wonderfully
free
and
elastic
it
had
not
settled
into
compartments
or
assumed
an
educational
form
which
would
secure
its
unrevised
transmission
from
teacher
to
student
it
was
not
gathered
together
in
systematic
treatises
aristotle
combined
the
supreme
powers
of
an
original
and
creative
thinker
with
the
impulses
of
a
textbook
writer
he
loved
order
and
classification
he
supplied
manuals
of
ethics
politics
logic
psychology
physics
metaphysics
economics
poetics
zoölogy
meteorology
constitutional
law
and
god
only
knows
what
not
for
we
do
not
have
by
any
means
all
the
things
he
wrote
and
he
was
equally
interested
and
perhaps
equally
capable
in
all
the
widely
scattered
fields
in
which
he
labored
and
some
of
his
manuals
were
so
overwhelming
in
the
conclusiveness
of
their
reasoning
so
in
their
scope
that
the
mediaeval
universities
may
be
forgiven
for
having
made
them
the
sole
basis
of
a
liberal
education
and
for
imposing
fines
on
those
who
ventured
to
differ
from
the
philosopher
he
seemed
to
know
everything
that
could
be
known
and
to
have
ordered
all
earthly
knowledge
in
an
inspired
codification
which
would
stand
the
professors
in
good
stead
down
to
the
day
of
judgment
aristotle
combined
an
essentially
metaphysical
taste
with
a
preternatural
power
of
observation
in
dealing
with
the
workings
of
nature
in
spite
of
his
inevitable
mistakes
which
became
the
curse
of
later
docile
generations
no
other
thinker
of
whom
we
have
record
can
really
compare
with
him
in
the
distinction
and
variety
of
his
achievements
it
is
not
his
fault
that
posterity
used
his
works
to
hamper
further
progress
and
clarification
he
is
the
father
of
book
knowledge
and
the
grandfather
of
the
commentator
after
two
or
three
hundred
years
of
talking
in
the
market
place
and
of
philosophic
discussions
prolonged
until
morning
such
of
the
greeks
as
were
predisposed
to
speculation
had
thought
all
the
thoughts
and
uttered
all
the
criticisms
of
commonly
accepted
beliefs
and
of
one
another
that
could
by
any
possibility
occur
to
those
who
had
little
inclination
to
fare
forth
and
extend
their
knowledge
of
the
realities
of
nature
by
painful
and
specialized
research
and
examination
this
is
to
me
the
chief
reason
why
except
for
some
advances
in
mathematics
astronomy
geography
and
the
refinements
of
scholarship
the
glorious
period
of
the
greek
mind
is
commonly
and
rightfully
assumed
to
have
come
to
an
end
about
the
time
of
aristotle
death
why
did
the
greeks
not
go
on
as
modern
scientists
have
gone
on
with
vistas
of
the
unachieved
still
ahead
of
them
in
the
first
place
greek
civilization
was
founded
on
slavery
and
a
fixed
condition
of
the
industrial
arts
the
philosopher
and
scholar
was
estopped
from
fumbling
with
those
everyday
processes
that
were
associated
with
the
mean
life
of
the
slave
and
servant
consequently
there
was
no
one
to
devise
the
practical
apparatus
by
which
alone
profound
and
knowledge
of
natural
operations
is
possible
the
mechanical
inventiveness
of
the
greeks
was
slight
and
hence
they
never
came
upon
the
lens
they
had
no
microscope
to
reveal
the
minute
no
telescope
to
attract
the
remote
they
never
devised
a
mechanical
timepiece
a
thermometer
nor
a
barometer
to
say
nothing
of
cameras
and
spectroscopes
archimedes
it
is
reported
disdained
to
make
any
record
of
his
ingenious
devices
for
they
were
unworthy
the
noble
profession
of
a
philosopher
such
inventions
as
were
made
were
usually
either
toys
or
of
a
heavy
practical
character
so
the
next
great
step
forward
in
the
extension
of
the
human
mind
awaited
the
disappearance
of
slavery
and
the
slowly
dawning
suspicion
and
final
repudiation
of
the
older
metaphysics
which
first
became
marked
some
three
hundred
years
ago
notes
when
in
the
time
of
cicero
the
works
of
aristotle
were
recovered
and
put
into
the
hands
of
andronicus
of
rhodes
to
edit
he
found
certain
fragments
of
highly
abstruse
speculation
which
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
so
he
called
them
addenda
to
the
physics
meta
ta
these
fragments
under
the
caption
metaphysica
became
the
most
revered
of
aristotle
productions

first
philosophy
as
the
scholastics
were
wont
to
call
it
john
dewey
deduces
metaphysics
from
man
original
reverie
and
then
shows
how
in
time
it
became
a
solemn
form
of
rationalizing
current
habits
and
standards
in
lectures
it
is
certainly
surprising
how
few
philosophical
writers
have
ever
reached
other
than
perfectly
commonplace
conclusions
in

to
practical
morality

origin
of
the
mediaeval
civilization
in
the
formation
of
what
we
may
call
our
historical
mind
namely
that
modification
of
our
animal
and
primitive
outlook
which
has
been
produced
by
men
of
exceptional
intellectual
venturesomeness
the
greeks
played
a
great
part
we
have
seen
how
the
greek
thinkers
introduced
for
the
first
time
highly
subtle
and
critical
ways
of
scrutinizing
old
beliefs
and
how
they
disabused
their
minds
of
many
an
ancient
and
naïve
mistake
but
our
current
ways
of
thinking
are
not
derived
directly
from
the
greeks
we
are
separated
from
them
by
the
roman
empire
and
the
middle
ages
when
we
think
of
athens
we
think
of
the
parthenon
and
its
frieze
of
sophocles
and
euripides
of
socrates
and
plato
and
aristotle
of
urbanity
and
clarity
and
moderation
in
all
things
when
we
think
of
the
middle
ages
we
find
ourselves
in
a
world
of
monks
martyrs
and
miracles
of
popes
and
emperors
of
knights
and
ladies
we
remember
gregory
the
great
abélard
and
thomas
aquinas
and
very
little
do
these
reminiscences
have
in
common
with
those
of
hellas
it
was
indeed
a
different
world
with
quite
different
fundamental
presuppositions
marvelous
as
were
the
achievements
of
the
greeks
in
art
and
literature
and
ingenious
as
they
were
in
new
and
varied
combinations
of
ideas
they
paid
too
little
attention
to
the
common
things
of
the
world
to
devise
the
necessary
means
of
penetrating
its
mysteries
they
failed
to
come
upon
the
lens
or
other
instruments
of
modern
investigation
and
thus
never
gained
a
godlike
vision
of
the
remote
and
the
minute
their
critical
thought
was
consequently
not
grounded
in
experimental
or
applied
science
and
without
that
the
western
world
was
unable
to
advance
or
even
long
maintain
their
high
standards
of
criticism
after
the
hellenes
were
absorbed
into
the
vast
roman
empire
critical
thought
and
creative
intelligence
rare
and
precarious
things
at
best
began
to
decline
at
first
slowly
and
then
with
fatal
rapidity
and
completeness
moreover
new
and
highly
uncritical
beliefs
and
modes
of
thought
became
popular
they
came
from
the
near
east
mesopotamia
syria
egypt
and
asia
minor
and
largely
supplanted
the
critical
traditions
of
the
great
schools
of
greek
philosophy
the
stoic
and
epicurean
dogmas
had
lost
their
freshness
the
greek
thinkers
had
all
agreed
in
looking
for
salvation
through
intelligence
and
knowledge
but
eloquent
leaders
arose
to
reveal
a
new
salvation
and
over
the
portal
of
truth
they
erased
the
word
reason
and
wrote
faith
in
its
stead
and
the
people
listened
gladly
to
the
new
prophets
for
it
was
necessary
only
to
be
saved
and
believing
is
far
easier
than
thinking
it
was
religious
and
mystical
thought
which
in
contrast
to
the
secular
philosophy
of
the
greeks
and
the
scientific
thought
of
our
own
day
dominated
the
intellectual
life
of
the
middle
ages
before
considering
this
new
phase
through
which
the
human
mind
was
to
pass
it
is
necessary
to
guard
against
a
common
misapprehension
in
the
use
of
the
term
middle
ages
our
historical
textbooks
usually
include
in
that
period
the
happenings
between
the
dissolution
of
the
roman
empire
and
the
voyages
of
columbus
or
the
opening
of
the
protestant
revolt
to
the
student
of
intellectual
history
this
is
unfortunate
for
the
simple
reason
that
almost
all
the
ideas
and
even
institutions
of
the
middle
ages
such
as
the
church
and
monasticism
and
organized
religious
intolerance
really
originated
in
the
late
roman
empire
moreover
the
intellectual
revolution
which
has
ushered
in
the
thought
of
our
day
did
not
get
well
under
way
until
the
seventeenth
century
so
one
may
say
that
medieval
thought
began
long
before
the
accepted
beginning
of
the
middle
ages
and
persisted
a
century
or
so
after
they
are
ordinarily
esteemed
to
have
come
to
an
end
we
have
to
continue
to
employ
the
old
expression
for
sake
but
from
the
standpoint
of
the
history
of
the
european
mind
three
periods
should
be
distinguished
lying
between
ancient
greek
thought
as
it
was
flourishing
in
athens
alexandria
rhodes
rome
and
elsewhere
at
the
opening
of
the
christian
era
and
the
birth
of
modern
science
some
sixteen
hundred
years
later
the
first
of
these
is
the
period
of
the
christian
fathers
culminating
in
the
authoritative
writings
of
augustine
who
died
in
by
this
time
a
great
part
of
the
critical
greek
books
had
disappeared
in
western
europe
as
for
pagan
writers
one
has
difficulty
in
thinking
of
a
single
name
except
that
of
lucian
later
than
juvenal
who
had
died
nearly
three
hundred
years
before
augustine
worldly
knowledge
was
reduced
to
pitiful
compendiums
on
which
the
mediaeval
students
were
later
to
place
great
reliance
scientific
literary
and
historical
information
was
scarcely
to
be
had
the
western
world
so
far
as
it
thought
at
all
devoted
its
attention
to
religion
and
all
manner
of
mystical
ideas
old
and
new
as
harnack
has
so
well
said
the
world
was
already
intellectually
bankrupt
before
the
german
invasions
and
their
accompanying
disorders
plunged
it
into
still
deeper
ignorance
and
mental
obscurity
the
second
or
dark
age
lasted
with
only
slight
improvement
from
augustine
to
abélard
about
seven
hundred
years
the
prosperous
disappeared
towns
vanished
or
shriveled
up
libraries
were
burned
or
rotted
away
from
neglect
schools
were
closed
to
be
reopened
later
here
and
there
after
charlemagne
educational
edict
in
an
especially
enterprising
monastery
or
by
some
exceptional
bishop
who
did
not
spend
his
whole
time
in
fighting
from
about
the
year
conditions
began
to
be
more
and
more
favorable
to
the
revival
of
intellectual
ambition
a
recovery
of
forgotten
knowledge
and
a
gradual
accumulation
of
new
information
and
inventions
unknown
to
the
greeks
or
indeed
to
any
previous
civilization
the
main
presuppositions
of
this
third
period
of
the
later
middle
ages
go
back
however
to
the
roman
empire
they
had
been
formulated
by
the
church
fathers
transmitted
through
the
dark
age
and
were
now
elaborated
by
the
professors
in
the
newly
established
universities
under
the
influence
of
aristotle
recovered
works
and
built
up
into
a
majestic
intellectual
structure
known
as
scholasticism
on
these
mediaeval
university
professors
the
schoolmen
lord
bacon
long
ago
pronounced
a
judgment
that
may
well
stand
having
sharp
and
strong
wits
and
abundance
of
leisure
and
small
variety
of
reading
but
their
wits
being
shut
up
in
the
cells
of
a
few
authors
chiefly
aristotle
their
dictator
as
their
persons
were
shut
up
in
the
cells
of
monasteries
and
colleges
and
knowing
little
history
either
of
nature
or
time
they
did
out
of
no
great
quantity
of
matter
and
infinite
agitation
of
wit
spin
out
unto
us
those
laborious
webs
of
learning
which
are
extant
in
their
books
our
civilization
and
the
human
mind
critical
and
uncritical
as
we
now
find
it
in
our
western
world
is
a
direct
and
uninterrupted
outgrowth
of
the
civilization
and
thought
of
the
later
middle
ages
very
gradually
only
did
peculiarly
free
and
audacious
individual
thinkers
escape
from
this
or
that
mediaeval
belief
until
in
our
own
day
some
few
have
come
to
reject
practically
all
the
presuppositions
on
which
the
scholastic
system
was
reared
but
the
great
mass
of
christian
believers
whether
catholic
or
protestant
still
professedly
or
implicitly
adhere
to
the
assumptions
of
the
middle
ages
at
least
in
all
matters
in
which
religious
or
moral
sanctions
are
concerned
it
is
true
that
outside
the
catholic
clergy
the
term
mediaeval
is
often
used
in
a
sense
of
disparagement
but
that
should
not
blind
us
to
the
fact
that
mediaeval
presumptions
whether
for
better
or
worse
are
still
common
a
few
of
the
most
fundamental
of
these
presuppositions
especially
germane
to
our
theme
may
be
pointed
out
here
our
mediaeval
intellectual
inheritance
the
greeks
and
romans
had
various
theories
of
the
origin
of
things
all
vague
and
admittedly
conjectural
but
the
christians
relying
upon
the
inspired
account
in
the
bible
built
their
theories
on
information
which
they
believed
vouchsafed
to
them
by
god
himself
their
whole
conception
of
human
history
was
based
upon
a
far
more
fundamental
and
thorough
supernaturalism
than
we
find
among
the
greeks
and
romans
the
pagan
philosophers
reckoned
with
the
gods
to
be
sure
but
they
never
assumed
that
man
earthly
life
should
turn
entirely
on
what
was
to
happen
after
death
this
was
in
theory
the
sole
preoccupation
of
the
mediaeval
christian
life
here
below
was
but
a
brief
if
decisive
preliminary
to
the
real
life
to
come
the
mediaeval
christian
was
essentially
more
polytheistic
than
his
pagan
predecessors
for
he
pictured
hierarchies
of
good
and
evil
spirits
who
were
ever
aiding
him
to
reach
heaven
or
seducing
him
into
the
paths
of
sin
and
error
miracles
were
of
common
occurrence
and
might
be
attributed
either
to
god
or
the
devil
the
direct
intervention
of
both
good
and
evil
spirits
played
a
conspicuous
part
in
the
explanation
of
daily
acts
and
motives
as
a
distinguished
church
historian
has
said
the
god
of
the
middle
ages
was
a
god
of
arbitrariness
the
more
arbitrary
the
more
godlike
by
frequent
interferences
with
the
regular
course
of
events
he
made
his
existence
clear
reassured
his
children
of
his
continued
solicitude
and
frustrated
the
plots
of
the
evil
one
not
until
the
eighteenth
century
did
any
considerable
number
of
thinkers
revolt
against
this
conception
of
the
deity
and
come
to
worship
a
god
of
orderliness
who
abode
by
his
own
laws
the
mediaeval
thinkers
all
accepted
without
question
what
santayana
has
strikingly
described
as
the
christian
epic
this
included
the
general
historical
conceptions
of
how
man
came
about
and
how
in
view
of
his
origin
and
his
past
he
should
conduct
his
life
the
universe
had
come
into
being
in
less
than
a
week
and
man
had
originally
been
created
in
a
state
of
perfection
along
with
all
other
things
sun
moon
and
stars
plants
and
animals
after
a
time
the
first
human
pair
had
yielded
to
temptation
transgressed
god
commands
and
been
driven
from
the
lovely
garden
in
which
he
had
placed
them
so
sin
came
into
the
world
and
the
offspring
of
the
guilty
pair
were
thereby
contaminated
and
defiled
from
the
womb
in
time
the
wickedness
became
such
on
the
newly
created
earth
that
god
resolved
to
blot
out
mankind
excepting
only
noah
family
which
was
spared
to
repeople
the
earth
after
the
flood
but
the
unity
of
language
that
man
had
formerly
possessed
was
lost
at
the
appointed
time
preceded
by
many
prophetic
visions
among
the
chosen
people
god
sent
his
son
to
live
the
life
of
men
on
earth
and
become
their
saviour
by
submitting
to
death
thereafter
with
the
spread
of
the
gospel
the
struggle
between
the
kingdom
of
god
and
that
of
the
devil
became
the
supreme
conflict
of
history
it
was
to
culminate
in
the
last
judgment
when
the
final
separation
of
good
and
evil
should
take
place
and
the
blessed
should
ascend
into
the
heavens
to
dwell
with
god
forever
while
the
wicked
sank
to
hell
to
writhe
in
endless
torment
this
general
account
of
man
his
origin
and
fate
embraced
in
the
christian
epic
was
notable
for
its
precision
its
divine
authenticity
and
the
obstacles
which
its
authority
consequently
presented
to
any
revision
in
the
light
of
increasing
knowledge
the
fundamental
truths
in
regard
to
man
were
assumed
to
be
established
once
and
for
all
the
greek
thinkers
had
had
little
in
the
way
of
authority
on
which
to
build
and
no
inconsiderable
number
of
them
frankly
confessed
that
they
did
not
believe
that
such
a
thing
could
exist
for
the
thoroughly
sophisticated
intelligence
but
mediaeval
philosophy
and
science
grounded
wholly
in
the
mediaeval
schoolmen
turned
aside
from
the
hard
path
of
skepticism
long
searchings
and
investigation
of
actual
phenomena
and
confidently
believed
that
they
could
find
truth
by
the
easy
way
of
revelation
and
the
elaboration
of
unquestioned
dogmas
this
reliance
on
authority
is
a
fundamental
primitive
trait
we
have
inherited
it
not
only
from
our
mediaeval
forefathers
but
like
them
and
through
them
from
long
generations
of
prehistoric
men
we
all
have
a
natural
tendency
to
rely
upon
established
beliefs
and
fixed
institutions
this
is
an
expression
of
our
spontaneous
confidence
in
everything
that
comes
to
us
in
an
unquestioned
form
as
children
we
are
subject
to
authority
and
can
not
escape
the
control
of
existing
opinion
we
unconsciously
absorb
our
ideas
and
views
from
the
group
in
which
we
happen
to
live
what
we
see
about
us
what
we
are
told
and
what
we
read
has
to
be
received
at
its
face
value
so
long
as
there
are
no
conflicts
to
arouse
skepticism
we
are
tremendously
suggestible
our
mechanism
is
much
better
adapted
to
credulity
than
to
questioning
all
of
us
believe
nearly
all
the
time
few
doubt
and
only
now
and
then
the
past
exercises
an
almost
irresistible
fascination
over
us
as
children
we
learn
to
look
up
to
the
old
and
when
we
grow
up
we
do
not
permit
our
poignant
realization
of
elderly
incapacity
among
our
contemporaries
to
rouse
suspicions
of
moses
isaiah
confucius
or
aristotle
their
sayings
come
to
us
unquestioned
their
remoteness
makes
inquiry
into
their
competence
impossible
we
readily
assume
that
they
had
sources
of
information
and
wisdom
superior
to
the
prophets
of
our
own
day
during
the
middle
ages
reverence
for
authority
and
for
that
particular
form
of
authority
which
we
may
call
the
tyranny
of
the
past
was
dominant
but
probably
not
more
so
than
it
had
been
in
other
societies
and
ages
in
ancient
egypt
in
china
and
india
of
the
great
sources
of
mediaeval
authority
the
bible
and
the
church
fathers
the
roman
and
church
law
and
the
encyclopaedic
writings
of
aristotle
none
continues
nowadays
to
hold
us
in
its
old
grip
even
the
bible
although
nominally
unquestioned
among
roman
catholics
and
all
the
more
orthodox
protestant
sects
is
rarely
appealed
to
as
of
old
in
parliamentary
debate
or
in
discussions
of
social
and
economic
questions
it
is
still
a
religious
authority
but
it
no
longer
forms
the
basis
of
secular
decisions
the
findings
of
modern
science
have
shaken
the
hold
of
the
sources
of
mediaeval
authority
but
they
have
done
little
as
yet
to
loosen
our
inveterate
habit
of
relying
on
the
more
insidious
authority
of
current
practice
and
belief
we
still
assume
that
received
dogmas
represent
the
secure
conclusions
of
mankind
and
that
current
institutions
represent
the
approved
results
of
much
experiment
in
the
past
which
it
would
be
worse
than
futile
to
repeat
one
solemn
remembrancer
will
cite
as
a
warning
the
discreditable
experience
of
the
greek
cities
in
democracy
another
how
the
decline
of
morality
and
the
disintegration
of
the
family
heralded
the
fall
of
rome
another
the
constant
menace
of
mob
rule
as
exemplified
in
the
reign
of
terror
but
to
the
student
of
history
these
alleged
illustrations
have
little
bearing
on
present
conditions
he
is
struck
moreover
with
the
ease
with
which
ancient
misapprehensions
are
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
and
with
the
difficulty
of
launching
a
newer
and
clearer
and
truer
idea
of
anything
bacon
warns
us
that
the
multitude
or
the
wisest
for
the
multitude
sake
is
in
reality
ready
to
give
passage
rather
to
that
which
is
popular
and
superficial
than
to
that
which
is
substantial
and
profound
for
the
truth
is
that
time
seemeth
to
be
of
the
nature
of
a
river
or
stream
which
carrieth
down
to
us
that
which
is
light
and
blown
up
and
sinketh
and
drowneth
that
which
is
weighty
and
solid
it
is
very
painful
to
most
minds
to
admit
that
the
past
does
not
furnish
us
with
reliable
permanent
standards
of
conduct
and
of
public
policy
we
resent
the
imputation
that
things
are
not
going
on
the
whole
pretty
well
and
find
excuses
for
turning
our
backs
on
disconcerting
and
puzzling
facts
we
are
full
of
respectable
fears
and
a
general
timidity
in
the
face
of
conditions
which
we
vaguely
feel
are
escaping
control
in
spite
of
our
best
efforts
to
prevent
any
thoroughgoing
readjustment
we
instinctively
try
to
show
that
keynes
must
surely
be
wrong
about
the
treaty
of
versailles
that
gibbs
must
be
perversely
exaggerating
the
horrors
of
modern
war
that
hobson
certainly
views
the
industrial
crisis
with
unjustifiable
pessimism
that
business
as
usual
can
not
be
that
socially
perverse
and
incredibly
inexpedient
thing
veblen
shows
it
to
be
that
robin
picture
of
lenin
can
only
be
explained
by
a
disguised
sympathy
for
bolshevism
yet
even
if
we
could
assume
that
traditional
opinion
is
a
fairly
clear
and
reliable
reflection
of
experience
surely
it
should
have
less
weight
in
our
day
and
generation
than
in
the
past
for
changes
have
overtaken
mankind
which
have
fundamentally
altered
the
conditions
in
which
we
live
and
which
are
revolutionizing
the
relations
between
individuals
and
classes
and
nations
moreover
we
must
remember
that
knowledge
has
widened
and
deepened
so
that
could
any
of
us
really
catch
up
with
the
information
of
our
own
time
he
would
have
little
temptation
to
indulge
the
mediaeval
habit
of
appealing
to
the
authority
of
the
past
the
christian
epic
did
not
have
to
rely
for
its
perpetuation
either
on
its
intellectual
plausibility
or
its
traditional
authority
during
the
middle
ages
there
developed
a
vast
and
powerful
religious
state
the
mediaeval
church
the
real
successor
as
hobbes
pointed
out
to
the
roman
empire
and
the
church
with
all
its
resources
including
its
control
over
the
secular
arm
of
kings
and
princes
was
ready
to
defend
the
christian
beliefs
against
question
and
revision
to
doubt
the
teachings
of
the
church
was
the
supreme
crime
it
was
treason
against
god
himself
in
comparison
with
which
to
judge
from
mediaeval
experts
on
heresy
murder
was
a
minor
offense
we
do
not
however
inherit
our
present
disposition
to
intolerance
solely
from
the
middle
ages
as
animals
and
children
and
savages
we
are
naively
and
unquestioningly
intolerant
all
divergence
from
the
customary
is
suspicious
and
repugnant
it
seems
perverse
and
readily
suggests
evil
intentions
indeed
so
natural
and
spontaneous
is
intolerance
that
the
question
of
freedom
of
speech
and
writing
scarcely
became
a
real
issue
before
the
seventeenth
century
we
have
seen
that
some
of
the
greek
thinkers
were
banished
or
even
executed
for
their
new
ideas
the
roman
officials
as
well
as
the
populace
pestered
the
early
christians
not
so
much
for
the
substance
of
their
views
as
because
they
were
puritanical
refused
the
routine
reverence
to
the
gods
and
prophesied
the
downfall
of
the
state
but
with
the
firm
establishment
of
christianity
edicts
began
to
be
issued
by
the
roman
emperors
making
orthodox
christian
belief
the
test
of
good
citizenship
one
who
disagreed
with
the
emperor
and
his
religious
advisers
in
regard
to
the
relation
of
the
three
members
of
the
trinity
was
subject
to
prosecution
heretical
books
were
burned
the
houses
of
heretics
destroyed
so
organized
mediaeval
religious
intolerance
was
like
so
many
other
things
a
heritage
of
the
later
roman
empire
and
was
duly
sanctioned
in
both
the
theodosian
and
justinian
codes
it
was
however
with
the
inquisition
beginning
in
the
thirteenth
century
that
the
intolerance
of
the
middle
ages
reached
its
most
perfect
organization
heresy
was
looked
upon
as
a
contagious
disease
that
must
be
checked
at
all
costs
it
did
not
matter
that
the
heretic
usually
led
a
conspicuously
blameless
life
that
he
was
arduous
did
not
swear
was
emaciated
with
fasting
and
refused
to
participate
in
the
vain
recreations
of
his
fellows
he
was
indeed
overserious
and
took
his
religion
too
hard
this
offensive
parading
as
an
angel
of
light
was
explained
as
the
devil
camouflage
no
one
tried
to
find
out
what
the
heretic
really
thought
or
what
were
the
merits
of
his
divergent
beliefs
because
he
insisted
on
expressing
his
conception
of
god
in
slightly
unfamiliar
terms
the
heretic
was
often
branded
as
an
atheist
just
as
the
socialist
is
so
often
accused
of
being
opposed
to
all
government
when
the
real
objection
to
him
is
that
he
believes
in
too
much
government
it
was
sufficient
to
classify
a
suspected
heretic
as
an
albigensian
or
waldensian
or
a
member
of
some
other
heretical
sect
there
was
no
use
in
his
trying
to
explain
or
justify
it
was
enough
that
he
diverged
there
have
been
various
explanations
of
mediaeval
religious
intolerance
lecky
for
example
thought
that
it
was
due
to
the
theory
of
exclusive
salvation
that
since
there
was
only
one
way
of
getting
to
heaven
all
should
obviously
be
compelled
to
adopt
it
for
the
saving
of
their
souls
from
eternal
torment
but
one
finds
little
solicitude
for
the
damned
in
mediaeval
writings
the
public
at
large
thought
hell
none
too
bad
for
one
who
revolted
against
god
and
holy
church
no
the
heretics
were
persecuted
because
heresy
was
according
to
the
notions
of
the
time
a
monstrous
and
unutterably
wicked
thing
and
because
their
beliefs
threatened
the
vested
interests
of
that
day
we
now
realize
more
clearly
than
did
lecky
that
the
church
was
really
a
state
in
the
middle
ages
with
its
own
laws
and
courts
and
prisons
and
regular
taxation
to
which
all
were
subject
it
had
all
the
interests
and
all
the
touchiness
of
a
state
and
more
the
heretic
was
a
traitor
and
a
rebel
he
thought
that
he
could
get
along
without
the
pope
and
bishops
and
that
he
could
well
spare
the
ministrations
of
the
orthodox
priests
and
escape
their
exactions
he
was
the
anarchist
the
red
of
his
time
who
was
undermining
established
authority
and
with
the
approval
of
all
citizens
he
was
treated
accordingly
for
the
mediaeval
citizen
no
more
conceived
of
a
state
in
which
the
church
was
not
the
dominating
authority
than
we
can
conceive
of
a
society
in
which
the
present
political
state
may
have
been
superseded
by
some
other
form
of
organization
yet
the
inconceivable
has
come
to
pass
secular
authority
has
superseded
in
nearly
all
matters
the
old
ecclesiastical
regime
what
was
the
supreme
issue
of
the
middle
ages
the
distinction
between
the
religious
heretic
and
the
orthodox
is
the
least
of
public
questions
now
what
then
we
may
ask
has
been
the
outcome
of
the
old
religious
persecutions
of
the
trials
tortures
imprisonings
burnings
and
massacres
culminating
with
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
what
did
the
inquisition
and
the
censorship
both
so
long
unquestioned
accomplish
did
they
succeed
in
defending
the
truth
or
safeguarding
society
at
any
rate
conformity
was
not
established
nor
did
the
holy
roman
church
maintain
its
monopoly
although
it
has
survived
purified
and
freed
from
many
an
ancient
abuse
in
most
countries
of
western
europe
and
in
our
own
land
one
may
now
believe
as
he
wishes
teach
such
religious
views
as
appeal
to
him
and
join
with
others
who
share
his
sympathies
atheism
is
still
a
shocking
charge
in
many
ears
but
the
atheist
is
no
longer
an
outlaw
has
been
demonstrated
in
short
that
religious
dogma
can
be
neglected
in
matters
of
public
concern
and
reduced
to
a
question
of
private
taste
and
this
is
an
incredible
revolution
but
we
have
many
reasons
for
suspecting
that
in
a
much
shorter
time
than
that
which
has
elapsed
since
the
inquisition
was
founded
the
present
attempt
to
eliminate
by
force
those
who
contemplate
a
fundamental
reordering
of
social
and
economic
relations
will
seem
quite
as
inexpedient
and
hopeless
as
the
inquisition
effort
to
defend
the
monopoly
of
the
mediaeval
church
we
can
learn
much
from
the
past
in
regard
to
wrong
ways
of
dealing
with
new
ideas
as
yet
we
have
only
and
highly
expensive
modes
of
meeting
the
inevitable
changes
which
are
bound
to
take
place
repression
has
now
and
then
enjoyed
some
temporary
success
it
is
true
but
in
the
main
it
has
failed
lamentably
and
produced
only
suffering
and
confusion
much
will
depend
on
whether
our
purpose
is
to
keep
things
as
they
are
or
to
bring
about
readjustments
designed
to
correct
abuses
and
injustice
in
the
present
order
do
we
believe
in
other
words
that
truth
is
finally
established
and
that
we
have
only
to
defend
it
or
that
it
is
still
in
the
making
do
we
believe
in
what
is
commonly
called
progress
or
do
we
think
of
that
as
belonging
only
to
the
past
have
we
on
the
whole
arrived
or
are
we
only
on
the
way
or
mayhap
just
starting
in
the
middle
ages
even
in
the
times
of
the
greeks
and
romans
there
was
little
or
no
conception
of
progress
as
the
word
is
now
used
there
could
doubtless
be
improvement
in
detail
men
could
be
wiser
and
better
or
more
ignorant
and
perverse
but
the
assumption
was
that
in
general
the
social
economic
and
religious
order
was
fairly
standardized
this
was
especially
true
in
the
middle
ages
during
these
centuries
men
single
objective
was
the
assurance
of
heaven
and
escape
from
hell
life
was
an
angry
river
into
which
men
were
cast
demons
were
on
every
hand
to
drag
them
down
the
only
aim
could
be
with
god
help
to
reach
the
celestial
shore
there
was
no
time
to
consider
whether
the
river
might
be
made
less
dangerous
by
concerted
effort
through
the
deflection
of
its
torrents
and
the
removal
of
its
sharpest
rocks
no
one
thought
that
human
efforts
should
be
directed
to
making
the
lot
of
humanity
progressively
better
by
intelligent
reforms
in
the
light
of
advancing
knowledge
the
world
was
a
place
to
escape
from
on
the
best
terms
possible
in
our
own
day
this
mediaeval
idea
of
a
static
society
yields
only
grudgingly
and
the
notion
of
inevitable
vital
change
is
as
yet
far
from
assimilated
we
confess
it
with
our
lips
but
resist
it
in
our
hearts
we
have
learned
as
yet
to
respect
only
one
class
of
fundamental
innovators
those
dedicated
to
natural
science
and
its
applications
the
social
innovator
is
still
generally
suspect
to
the
mediaeval
theologian
man
was
by
nature
vile
we
have
seen
that
according
to
the
christian
epic
he
was
assoiled
from
birth
with
the
primeval
sin
of
his
first
parents
and
began
to
darken
his
score
with
fresh
offenses
of
his
own
as
soon
as
he
became
intelligent
enough
to
do
so
an
elaborate
mechanism
was
supplied
by
the
church
for
washing
away
the
original
pollution
and
securing
forgiveness
for
later
sins
indeed
this
was
ostensibly
its
main
business
we
may
still
well
ask
is
man
by
nature
bad
and
accordingly
as
we
answer
the
question
we
either
frame
appropriate
means
for
frustrating
his
evil
tendencies
or
if
we
see
some
promise
in
him
work
for
his
freedom
and
bid
him
take
advantage
of
it
to
make
himself
and
others
happy
so
far
as
i
know
charron
a
friend
of
montaigne
was
one
of
the
first
to
say
a
good
word
for
man
animal
nature
and
a
hundred
years
later
the
amiable
shaftesbury
pointed
out
some
honestly
gentlemanly
traits
in
the
species
to
the
modern
student
of
biology
and
anthropology
man
is
neither
good
nor
bad
there
is
no
longer
any
mystery
of
evil
but
the
mediaeval
notion
of
a
term
heavy
with
mysticism
and
deserving
of
careful
scrutiny
by
every
thoughtful
person
still
confuses
us
of
man
impulses
the
one
which
played
the
greatest
part
in
mediaeval
thoughts
of
sin
and
in
the
monastic
ordering
of
life
was
the
sexual
the
presuppositions
of
the
middle
ages
in
the
matter
of
the
relations
of
men
and
women
have
been
carried
over
to
our
own
day
as
compared
with
many
of
the
ideas
which
we
have
inherited
from
the
past
they
are
of
comparatively
recent
origin
the
greeks
and
romans
were
on
the
whole
primitive
and
uncritical
in
their
view
of
sex
the
philosophers
do
not
seem
to
have
speculated
on
sex
although
there
was
evidently
some
talk
in
athens
of
women
rights
the
movement
is
satirized
by
aristophanes
and
later
plato
showed
a
willingness
in
to
impeach
the
current
notions
of
the
family
and
women
position
in
general
but
there
are
few
traces
of
our
ideas
of
sexual
purity
in
the
classical
writers
to
the
stoic
philosopher
and
to
other
thoughtful
elderly
people
sexual
indulgence
was
deemed
a
low
order
of
pleasure
and
one
best
carefully
controlled
in
the
interests
of
peace
of
mind
but
with
the
incoming
of
christianity
an
essentially
new
attitude
developed
which
is
still
consciously
or
unconsciously
that
of
most
people
augustine
who
had
led
a
free
life
as
a
teacher
of
rhetoric
in
carthage
and
rome
came
in
his
later
years
to
believe
as
he
struggled
to
overcome
his
youthful
temptations
that
sexual
desire
was
the
most
devilish
of
man
enemies
and
the
chief
sign
of
his
degradation
he
could
imagine
no
such
unruly
urgence
in
man
perfect
estate
when
adam
and
eve
still
dwelt
in
paradise
but
with
man
fall
sexual
desire
appeared
as
the
sign
and
seal
of
human
debasement
this
theory
is
poignantly
set
forth
in
augustine
of
he
furnished
therein
a
philosophy
for
the
monks
and
doubtless
his
fourteenth
book
was
well
thumbed
by
those
who
were
wont
to
ponder
somewhat
wistfully
on
one
of
the
sins
they
had
fled
the
world
to
escape
christian
monasticism
was
spreading
in
western
europe
in
time
and
the
monkist
vows
included
chastity
there
followed
a
long
struggle
to
force
the
whole
priesthood
to
adopt
a
celibate
life
and
this
finally
succeeded
so
far
as
repeated
decrees
of
the
church
could
effect
it
marriage
was
proper
for
the
laity
but
both
the
monastic
and
secular
clergy
aspired
to
a
superior
holiness
which
should
banish
all
thoughts
of
fervent
earthly
love
thus
a
highly
unnatural
life
was
accepted
by
men
and
women
of
the
most
varied
temperament
and
often
with
slight
success
the
result
of
augustine
theories
and
of
the
efforts
to
frustrate
one
of
man
most
vehement
impulses
was
to
give
sex
a
conscious
importance
it
had
never
possessed
before
the
devil
was
thrust
out
of
the
door
only
to
come
in
at
all
the
windows
in
due
time
the
protestant
sects
abolished
monasteries
and
the
catholic
countries
later
followed
their
example
the
protestant
clergy
were
permitted
to
marry
and
the
old
asceticism
has
visibly
declined
but
it
has
done
much
to
determine
our
whole
attitude
toward
sex
and
there
is
no
class
of
questions
still
so
difficult
to
discuss
with
full
honesty
or
to
deal
with
critically
and
with
an
open
mind
as
those
relating
to
the
intimate
relations
of
men
and
women
no
one
familiar
with
mediaeval
literature
will
however
be
inclined
to
accuse
its
authors
of
prudishness
nevertheless
modern
prudishness
as
it
prevails
especially
in
england
and
the
united
states
our
squeamish
and
shamefaced
reluctance
to
recognize
and
deal
frankly
with
the
facts
and
problems
of
sex
is
clearly
an
outgrowth
of
the
mediaeval
attitude
which
looked
on
sexual
impulse
as
of
evil
origin
and
a
sign
of
man
degradation
modern
psychologists
have
shown
that
prudishness
is
not
always
an
indication
of
exceptional
purity
but
rather
the
reverse
it
is
often
a
disguise
thrown
over
repressed
sexual
interest
and
sexual
preoccupations
it
appears
to
be
decreasing
among
the
better
educated
of
the
younger
generation
the
study
of
biology
and
especially
of
embryology
is
an
easy
and
simple
way
of
disintegrating
the
impurity
complex
purity
in
the
sense
of
ignorance
and
suppressed
curiosity
is
a
highly
dangerous
state
of
mind
and
such
purity
in
alliance
with
prudery
and
defensive
hypocrisy
makes
any
honest
discussion
or
essential
readjustment
of
our
institutions
and
habits
extremely
difficult
one
of
the
greatest
contrasts
between
mediaeval
thinking
and
the
more
critical
thought
of
lies
in
the
general
conception
of
relation
to
the
cosmos
to
the
medieval
philosopher
as
to
the
stupidest
serf
of
the
time
the
world
was
made
for
man
all
the
heavenly
bodies
revolved
about
man
abode
as
their
center
all
creatures
were
made
to
assist
or
to
try
man
god
and
the
devil
were
preoccupied
with
his
fate
for
had
not
god
made
him
in
his
own
image
for
his
glory
and
was
not
the
devil
intent
on
populating
his
own
infernal
kingdom
it
was
easy
for
those
who
had
a
poetic
turn
of
mind
to
think
of
nature
workings
as
symbols
for
man
edification
the
habits
of
the
lion
or
the
eagle
yielded
moral
lessons
or
illustrated
the
divine
scheme
of
salvation
even
the
written
word
was
to
be
valued
not
for
what
it
seemed
to
say
but
for
hidden
allegories
depicting
man
struggles
against
evil
and
cheering
him
on
his
way
this
is
a
perennially
appealing
conception
of
things
it
corresponds
to
primitive
and
inveterate
tendencies
in
humanity
and
gratifies
under
the
guise
of
humility
our
hungering
for
the
mediaeval
thinker
however
freely
he
might
exercise
his
powers
of
logical
analysis
in
rationalizing
the
christian
epic
never
permitted
himself
to
question
its
general
anthropocentric
and
mystical
view
of
the
world
the
philosophic
mystic
assumes
the
role
of
a
docile
child
he
feels
that
all
vital
truth
transcends
his
powers
of
discovery
he
looks
to
the
infinite
and
eternal
mind
to
reveal
it
to
him
through
the
prophets
of
old
or
in
moments
of
ecstatic
communion
with
the
divine
intelligence
to
the
mystic
all
that
concerns
our
deeper
needs
transcends
logic
and
defies
analysis
in
his
estimate
the
human
reason
is
a
feeble
rushlight
which
can
at
best
cast
a
flickering
and
uncertain
ray
on
the
grosser
concerns
of
life
but
which
only
serves
to
intensify
the
darkness
which
surrounds
the
hidden
truth
of
god
in
order
that
modern
science
might
develop
it
is
clear
that
a
wholly
new
and
opposed
set
of
fundamental
convictions
had
to
be
substituted
for
those
of
the
middle
ages
man
had
to
cultivate
another
kind
of
and
a
new
and
more
profound
humility
he
had
come
to
believe
in
his
capacity
to
discover
important
truth
through
thoughtful
examination
of
things
about
him
and
he
had
to
recognize
on
the
other
hand
that
the
world
did
not
seem
to
be
made
for
him
but
that
humanity
was
apparently
a
curious
incident
in
the
universe
and
its
career
a
recent
episode
in
cosmic
history
he
had
to
acquire
a
taste
for
the
simplest
possible
and
most
thoroughgoing
explanation
of
things
his
whole
mood
had
to
change
and
impel
him
to
reduce
everything
so
far
as
possible
to
the
commonplace
this
new
view
was
inevitably
fiercely
attacked
by
the
mystically
disposed
they
misunderstood
it
and
berated
its
adherents
and
accused
them
of
robbing
man
of
all
that
was
most
precious
in
life
these
in
turn
were
goaded
into
bitterness
and
denounced
their
opponents
as
obscurantists
but
we
must
after
all
come
to
terms
in
some
way
with
the
emotions
underlying
mysticism
they
are
very
dear
to
us
and
scientific
knowledge
will
never
form
an
adequate
substitute
for
them
no
one
need
fear
that
the
supply
of
mystery
will
ever
give
out
but
a
great
deal
depends
on
our
taste
in
mystery
that
certainly
needs
refining
what
disturbs
the
rationalist
in
the
mystic
attitude
is
his
propensity
to
see
mysteries
where
there
are
none
and
to
fail
to
see
those
that
we
can
not
possibly
escape
in
declaring
that
one
is
not
a
mystic
one
makes
no
claim
to
be
able
to
explain
everything
nor
does
he
maintain
that
all
things
are
explicable
in
scientific
terms
indeed
no
thoughtful
person
will
be
likely
to
boast
that
he
can
fully
explain
anything
we
have
only
to
scrape
the
surface
of
our
experiences
to
find
fundamental
mystery
and
how
indeed
as
descendants
of
an
extinct
race
of
primates
with
a
mind
still
in
the
early
stages
of
accumulation
should
we
be
in
the
way
of
reaching
ultimate
truth
at
any
point
one
may
properly
urge
however
that
as
sharp
a
distinction
as
possible
be
made
between
fictitious
mysteries
and
the
unavoidable
ones
which
surround
us
on
every
side
how
milk
turned
sour

to
be
a
real
mystery

partially
solved

the
discovery
of
bacteria
how
the
witch
flew
up

chimney
was
a
gratuitous
mystery
with
which
we
need
no
longer
trouble
ourselves
a
live
wire
would
once
have
suggested
magic
now
it
is
at
least
partially
explained
by
the
doctrine
of
electrons
it
is
the
avowed
purpose
of
scientific
thought
to
reduce
the
number
of
mysteries
and
its
success
has
been
marvelous
but
it
has
by
no
means
done
its
perfect
work
as
yet
we
have
carried
over
far
too
much
of
mediaeval
mysticism
in
our
views
of
man
and
his
duty
toward
himself
and
others
we
must
now
recall
the
method
adopted
by
students
of
the
natural
sciences
in
breaking
away
from
the
standards
and
limitations
of
the
mediaeval
philosophers
and
establishing
new
standards
of
their
own
they
thus
prepared
the
way
for
a
revolution
in
human
affairs
in
the
midst
of
which
we
now
find
ourselves
as
yet
their
type
of
thinking
has
not
been
applied
on
any
considerable
scale
to
the
solution
of
social
problems
by
learning
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
scientific
frame
of
mind
as
a
historical
victory
won
against
extraordinary
odds
we
may
be
encouraged
to
cultivate
and
popularize
a

in

had
discovered
why
the
human
mind
enmeshed
in
mediaeval
metaphysics
and
indifferent
to

had
hitherto
been
a

and

vigor
and
never
has
there
been
a
man
better
equipped
with
literary
gifts
to
preach
a
new
gospel
than
francis
bacon
he
spent
years
in
devising
eloquent
and
ingenious
ways
of
delivering
learning
from
the
discredits
and
disgraces
of
the
past
and
in
exhorting
man
to
explore
the
realms
of
nature
for
his
delight
and
profit
he
never
wearied
of
trumpeting
forth
the
glories
of

come
with

profitable

schoolmen
for
spinning
out
endless
cobwebs

for
their
fineness

of
no

urged

to
come
out

the
creations
of

and
build
upon
what
they
discovered
a
new

down

and
to
spell
out
and
so
by
degrees
to
learn

already
begun
the

found
out
that

counter

theories

a
very
novel

it
introduced

fresh
and
momentous
element
into

intellectual
heritage

have
recalled

mysticism
supernaturalism

intolerance
of
the
middle
ages

reliance
on
old
books
and
their
indifference
to

fact

as
a
sort
of
allegory
for
the
edification
of

christian

schoolmen
devoted
themselves
to
the
elaborate
formulation
of
christian
doctrine
and
the
interpretation
of

it
was
a
period
of
revived
greek
metaphysics
adapted
to
prevailing
religious
presuppositions

that
they

did
not
venture
to
doubt
the
bible
but
they
eluded
it
in
various
ways
they
set
to
work
to
find
out
exactly
what
happened
under
certain
circumstances
they
experimented
individually
and
reported
their
discoveries
to
the
scientific
academies
which
began
to
come
into
existence
as
one
follows
the
deliberations
of
these
bodies
it
is
pathetic
to
observe
how
little
the
learning
of
previous
centuries
in
spite
of
its
imposing
claims
had
to
contribute
to
a
fruitful
knowledge
of
common
things
it
required
a
century
of
hard
work
to
establish
the
most
elementary
facts
which
would
now
be
found
in
a
child
book
how
water
and
air
act
how
to
measure
time
and
temperature
and
atmospheric
pressure
had
to
be
discovered
the
microscope
revealed
the
complexity
of
organic
tissues
the
existence
of
minute
creatures
vaguely
called
infusoria
and
the
strange
inhabitants
of
the
blood
the
red
and
white
corpuscles
the
telescope
put
an
end
to
the
flattering
assumption
that
the
cosmos
circled
around
man
and
the
little
ball
he
lives
on
without
a
certain
practical
inventive
tendency
which
for
reasons
not
easily
to
be
discovered
first
began
to
manifest
itself
in
the
thirteenth
century
this
progress
would
not
have
been
possible
the
new
thinkers
descended
from
the
magisterial
chair
and
patiently
fussed
with
lenses
tubes
pulleys
and
wheels
thus
weaning
themselves
from
the
adoration
of
man
mind
and
understanding
they
had
to
devise
the
machinery
of
investigation
as
investigation
itself
progressed
moreover
they
did
not
confine
themselves
to
the
conventionally
noble
and
elevated
subjects
of
speculation
they
addressed
themselves
to
worms
and
ditch
water
in
preference
to
metaphysical
subtleties
they
agreed
with
bacon
that
the
mean
and
even
filthy
things
deserve
study
all
this
was
naturally
scorned
by
the
university
professors
and
the
universities
consequently
played
little
or
no
part
in
the
advance
of
natural
science
until
the
nineteenth
century
nor
were
the
moral
leaders
of
mankind
behind
the
intellectual
in
opposing
the
novel
tendencies
the
clergy
did
all
they
could
to
perpetuate
the
squalid
belief
in
witchcraft
but
found
no
place
for
experimental
science
in
their
scheme
of
learning
and
judged
it
offensive
to
the
maker
of
all
things
but
their
opposition
could
do
no
more
than
hamper
the
new
scientific
impulse
which
was
far
too
potent
to
be
seriously
checked
so
in
one
department
of
human
thought
the
investigation
of
natural
processes
majestic
progress
has
been
made
since
the
opening
of
the
seventeenth
century
with
every
promise
of
continued
and
startling
advance
the
new
methods
employed
by
students
of
natural
science
have
resulted
in
the
accumulation
of
a
stupendous
mass
of
information
in
regard
to
the
material
structure
and
operation
of
things
and
the
gradual
way
in
which
the
earth
and
all
its
inhabitants
have
come
into
being
the
nature
and
workings
of
atoms
and
molecules
are
being
cleared
up
and
their
relation
to
heat
light
and
electricity
established
the
slow
processes
which
have
brought
about
the
mountains
and
valleys
the
seas
and
plains
have
been
exposed
the
structure
of
the
elementary
cell
can
be
studied
under
powerful
lenses
its
divisions
conjunctions
differentiation
and
multiplication
into
the
incredibly
intricate
substance
of
plants
and
animals
can
be
traced
in
short
man
is
now
in
a
position
for
the
first
time
in
his
history
to
have
some
really
clear
and
accurate
notion
of
the
world
in
which
he
dwells
and
of
the
living
creatures
which
surround
him
and
with
which
he
must
come
to
terms
it
would
seem
obvious
that
this
fresh
knowledge
should
enable
him
to
direct
his
affairs
more
intelligently
than
his
ancestors
were
able
to
do
in
their
ignorance
he
should
be
in
a
position
to
accommodate
himself
more
and
more
successfully
to
the
exigencies
of
an
existence
which
he
can
understand
more
fully
than
any
preceding
generation
and
he
should
aspire
to
deal
more
and
more
sagaciously
with
himself
and
his
how
scientific
knowledge
has
revolutionized
the
conditions
of
life
but
while
our
information
in
regard
to
man
and
the
world
is
incalculably
greater
than
that
available
a
hundred
even
fifty
years
ago
we
must
frankly
admit
that
the
knowledge
is
still
so
novel
so
imperfectly
assimilated
so
inadequately
and
so
feebly
and
ineffectively
presented
to
the
great
mass
of
men
that
its
effects
upon
human
impulses
and
reasoning
and
outlook
are
as
yet
inconsiderable
and
disappointing
we
think
in
terms
of
molecules
and
atoms
but
we
rarely
do
few
have
any
more
knowledge
of
their
own
bodily
operations
than
had
their
grandparents
the
confidence
in
the
phases
of
the
moon
gives
way
but
slowly
before
recent
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
bacteria
of
the
soil
few
who
use
the
telephone
ride
on
electric
cars
and
carry
a
camera
have
even
the
mildest
curiosity
in
regard
to
how
these
things
work
it
is
only
through
that
scientific
knowledge
touches
our
lives
on
every
hand
modifying
our
environment
altering
our
daily
habits
dislocating
the
anciently
established
order
and
imposing
the
burden
of
constant
adaptation
on
even
the
most
ignorant
and
lethargic
unlike
a
great
part
of
man
earlier
thought
modern
scientific
knowledge
and
theory
have
not
remained
matter
merely
for
academic
discourse
and
learned
books
but
have
provoked
the
invention
of
innumerable
practical
devices
which
surround
us
on
every
hand
and
from
which
we
can
now
scarce
escape
by
land
or
sea
thus
while
scientific
knowledge
has
not
greatly
affected
the
thoughts
of
most
of
us
its
influence
in
the
promotion
of
modern
invention
has
served
to
place
us
in
a
new
setting
or
environment
the
novel
features
of
which
it
would
be
no
small
task
to
explain
to
one
should
he
unexpectedly
apply
for
information
so
even
if
modern
scientific
is
as
yet
so
imperfect
and
ill
understood
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
apply
much
of
it
directly
and
personally
in
our
daily
conduct
we
nevertheless
can
not
neglect
the
urgent
effects
of
scientific
for
they
are
constantly
posing
new
problems
of
adjustment
to
us
and
sometimes
disposing
of
old
ones
let
us
recall
a
few
striking
examples
of
the
astonishing
way
in
which
what
seemed
in
the
beginning
to
be
rather
trivial
inventions
and
devices
have
with
the
improvements
of
modern
science
profoundly
altered
the
conditions
of
life
some
centuries
before
the
time
of
bacon
and
galileo
four
discoveries
were
made
which
supplemented
and
elaborated
by
later
insight
and
ingenuity
may
be
said
to
underlie
our
modern
civilization
a
writer
of
the
time
of
henry
ii
of
england
reports
that
sailors
when
caught
in
fog
or
darkness
were
wont
to
touch
a
needle
to
a
bit
of
magnetic
iron
the
needle
would
then
it
had
been
found
whirl
around
in
a
circle
and
come
to
rest
pointing
north
on
this
tiny
index
the
vast
extension
of
modern
commerce
and
imperialism
rests
that
bits
of
glass
would
magnify
objects
was
known
before
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
from
that
little
fact
have
come
microscopes
telescopes
spectroscopes
and
cameras
and
from
these
in
turn
has
come
a
great
part
of
our
present
knowledge
of
natural
processes
in
men
animals
and
plants
and
our
comprehension
of
the
cosmos
at
large
gunpowder
began
to
be
used
a
few
decades
after
the
lens
was
discovered
it
and
its
terrible
descendants
have
changed
the
whole
problem
of
human
warfare
and
of
the
public
defense
the
printing
press
originally
a
homely
scheme
for
saving
the
labor
of
the
copyist
has
not
only
made
modern
democracy
and
nationality
possible
but
has
helped
by
the
extension
of
education
to
undermine
the
ancient
foundations
upon
which
human
industry
has
rested
from
the
beginnings
of
civilization
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
steam
engine
began
to
supplant
the
muscular
power
of
men
and
animals
which
had
theretofore
been
only
feebly
supplemented
by
windmills
and
water
wheels
and
now
we
use
steam
and
gas
engines
and
water
power
to
generate
potent
electric
currents
which
do
their
work
far
from
the
source
of
supply
mechanical
ingenuity
has
utilized
all
this
energy
in
innumerable
novel
ways
for
producing
old
and
new
commodities
in
tremendous
quantities
and
distributing
them
with
incredible
rapidity
throughout
the
earth
vast
factories
have
sprung
up
with
their
laborious
multitudes
engaged
on
minute
contributions
to
the
finished
article
overgrown
cities
sprawl
over
the
neighboring
green
fields
and
pastures
long
freight
trains
of
steel
cars
thunder
across
continents
monstrous
masses
of
wealth
pile
up
are
reinvested
and
applied
to
making
the
whole
system
more
and
more
inconceivably
intricate
and
interdependent
and
incidentally
there
is
hurry
and
worry
and
discontent
and
hazard
beyond
belief
for
a
creature
who
has
to
grasp
it
all
and
control
it
all
with
a
mind
reared
on
that
of
an
animal
a
child
and
a
savage
as
if
these
changes
were
not
astounding
enough
now
has
come
the
chemist
who
devotes
himself
to
making
not
new
or
old
ones
in
new
ways
but
new
he
juggles
with
the
atoms
of
carbon
hydrogen
oxygen
nitrogen
chlorine
and
the
rest
and
far
outruns
the
workings
of
nature
up
to
date
he
has
been
able
to
produce
artfully
over
two
hundred
thousand
compounds
for
some
of
which
mankind
formerly
depended
on
the
alchemy
of
animals
and
plants
he
can
make
foodstuffs
out
of
sewage
he
can
entrap
the
nitrogen
in
the
air
and
use
it
to
raise
wheat
to
feed
or
high
explosives
to
slaughter
his
fellows
he
no
longer
relies
on
plants
and
animals
for
dyes
and
perfumes
in
short
a
chemical
discovery
may
at
any
moment
devastate
an
immemorial
industry
and
leave
both
capital
and
labor
in
the
lurch
the
day
may
not
be
far
distant
when
should
the
chemist
learn
to
control
the
incredible
interatomic
energy
the
steam
engine
will
seem
as
complete
an
anachronism
as
the
treadmill
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
have
been
visited
by
europeans
and
commerce
has
brought
all
races
of
the
globe
into
close
touch
we
have
now
to
reckon
with
every
nation
under
heaven
as
was
shown
in
the
world
war
at
the
same
time
steam
and
electrical
communication
have
been
so
perfected
that
space
has
been
practically
annihilated
as
regards
speech
and
in
matters
of
transportation
reduced
to
perhaps
a
fifth
so
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
form
economically
a
loose
and
as
yet
scarcely
acknowledged
federation
of
man
in
which
the
fate
of
any
member
may
affect
the
affairs
of
all
the
others
no
matter
how
remote
they
may
be
geographically
all
these
unprecedented
conditions
have
conspired
to
give
business
for
business
sake
a
fascination
and
overwhelming
importance
it
has
never
had
before
we
no
longer
make
things
for
the
sake
of
making
them
but
for
money
the
chair
is
not
made
to
sit
on
but
for
profit
the
soap
is
no
longer
prepared
for
purposes
of
cleanliness
but
to
be
sold
for
profit
practically
nothing
catches
our
eye
in
the
way
of
writing
that
was
written
for
its
own
sake
and
not
for
money
our
magazines
and
newspapers
are
our
modern
commercial
travelers
proclaiming
the
gospel
of
business
competition
formerly
the
laboring
classes
worked
because
they
were
slaves
or
because
they
were
defenseless
and
could
not
escape
from
thraldom
or
mayhap
because
they
were
natural
artisans
but
now
they
are
coming
into
a
position
where
they
can
combine
and
bargain
and
enter
into
business
competition
with
their
employers
like
their
employers
they
are
learning
to
give
as
little
as
possible
for
as
much
as
possible
this
is
good
business
and
the
employer
should
realize
that
at
last
he
has
succeeded
in
teaching
his
employees
to
be
strictly
businesslike
when
houses
were
built
to
live
in
and
wheat
and
cattle
grown
to
eat
these
essential
industries
took
care
of
themselves
but
now
that
profit
is
the
motive
for
building
houses
and
raising
grain
if
the
promised
returns
are
greater
from
manufacturing
automobiles
or
embroidered
lingerie
one
is
tempted
to
ask
if
there
are
any
longer
compelling
reasons
for
building
houses
or
raising
food
along
with
the
new
inventions
and
discoveries
and
our
inordinately
pervasive
commerce
have
come
two
other
novel
elements
in
our
environment
what
we
vaguely
call
democracy
and
nationality
these
also
are
to
be
traced
to
applied
science
and
mechanical
contrivances
the
printing
press
has
made
popular
education
possible
and
it
is
our
aspiration
to
have
every
boy
and
girl
learn
to
read
and
write
an
ideal
that
the
western
world
has
gone
far
to
realize
in
the
last
hundred
years
general
education
introduced
first
among
men
and
then
extended
to
women
has
made
plausible
the
contention
that
all
adults
should
have
a
vote
and
thereby
exercise
some
ostensible
influence
in
the
choice
of
public
officials
and
in
the
direction
of
the
policy
of
the
government
until
recently
the
mass
of
the
people
have
not
been
invited
to
turn
their
attention
to
public
affairs
which
have
been
left
in
the
control
of
the
richer
classes
and
their
representatives
and
agents
the
statesmen
or
politicians
doubtless
our
crowded
cities
have
contributed
to
a
growing
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
common
man
for
all
must
now
share
the
street
car
the
public
park
the
water
supply
and
contagious
diseases
but
there
is
a
still
more
fundamental
discovery
underlying
our
democratic
tendencies
this
is
the
easily
demonstrated
scientific
truth
that
nearly
all
men
and
women
whatever
their
social
and
economic
status
may
have
much
greater
possibilities
of
activity
and
thought
and
emotion
than
they
exhibit
in
the
particular
conditions
in
which
they
happen
to
be
placed
that
in
all
ranks
may
be
found
evidence
of
unrealized
capacity
that
we
are
living
on
a
far
lower
scale
of
intelligent
conduct
and
rational
enjoyment
than
is
necessary
our
present
notions
of
nationality
are
of
very
recent
origin
going
back
scarcely
a
hundred
years
formerly
nations
were
made
up
of
the
subjects
of
this
or
that
gracious
majesty
and
were
regarded
by
their
rulers
as
beasts
of
burden
or
slaves
or
in
more
amiable
moods
as
children
the
same
forces
that
have
given
rise
to
modern
democracy
have
made
it
possible
for
vast
groups
of
people
such
as
make
up
france
or
the
united
states
to
be
held
together
more
intimately
than
ever
before
by
the
news
which
reaches
them
daily
of
the
enterprises
of
their
government
and
the
deeds
of
their
conspicuous
in
this
way
the
inhabitants
of
an
extensive
territory
embracing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
square
miles
are
brought
as
close
together
as
the
people
of
athens
in
former
days
man
is
surely
a
gregarious
animal
who
dislikes
solitude
he
is
moreover
given
to
the
most
exaggerated
estimate
of
his
tribe
and
on
these
ancient
foundations
modern
nationality
has
been
built
up
by
means
of
the
printing
press
the
telegraph
and
cheap
postage
it
has
fallen
out
that
just
when
the
world
was
becoming
effectively
cosmopolitan
in
its
economic
interdependence
its
scientific
research
and
its
exchange
of
books
and
art
the
ancient
tribal
insolence
has
been
developed
on
a
stupendous
the
manner
in
which
man
has
revolutionized
his
environment
habits
of
conduct
and
purposes
of
life
by
inventions
is
perhaps
the
most
astonishing
thing
in
human
history
it
is
an
obscure
and
hitherto
rather
neglected
subject
but
it
is
clear
enough
from
the
little
that
has
been
said
here
that
since
the
middle
ages
and
especially
in
the
past
hundred
years
science
has
so
hastened
the
process
of
change
that
it

is
so
difficult
a
task
to
form
any
correct
estimate
of
one
own
surroundings
largely
on
account
of
our
very
familiarity
with
them
that
historical
students
have
generally
evaded
this
responsibility
they
have
often
declared
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
satisfactorily
and
yet
no
one
will
ever
know
more
than
we
about
what
is
going
on
now
some
secrets
may
be
revealed
to
coming
generations
but
plenty
of
our
circumstances
will
be
obscure
to
them
and
it
certainly
seems
pusillanimous
if
not
hazardous
to
depute
to
those
yet
unborn
the
task
of
comprehending
the
conditions
under
which
we
must
live
and
strive
i
have
long
believed
that
the
only
unmistakable
contribution
that
the
historical
student
can
make
to
the
progress
of
intelligence
is
to
study
the
past
with
an
eye
constantly
on
the
present
for
history
not
only
furnishes
us
with
the
key
to
the
present
by
showing
how
our
situation
came
about
but
at
the
same
time
supplies
a
basis
of
comparison
and
a
point
of
vantage
by
virtue
of
which
the
salient
contrasts
between
our
days
and
those
of
old
can
be
detected
without
history
the
essential
differences
are
sure
to
escape
us
our
generation
like
all
preceding
generations
of
mankind
inevitably
takes
what
it
finds
largely
for
granted
and
the
great
mass
of
men
who
argue
about
existing
conditions
assume
a
fundamental
likeness
to
past
conditions
as
the
basis
of
their
conclusions
in
regard
to
the
present
and
the
still
unrolled
future
such
a
procedure
becomes
more
and
more
dangerous
for
although
a
continuity
persists
there
are
more
numerous
deeper
and
wider
reaching
contrasts
between
the
world
of
and
that
of
a
hundred
or
even
fifty
years
ago
than
have
developed
in
any
corresponding
lapse
of
time
since
the
beginning
of
civilization
this
is
not
the
place
even
to
sketch
the
novelties
in
our
knowledge
and
circumstances
our
problems
and
possibilities
no
more
can
be
done
here
than
to
illustrate
in
a
single
field
of
human
interest
the
need
of
an
unprecedentedly
open
mind
in
order
to
avail
ourselves
of
existing
resources
in
grasping
and
manipulating
the
problems
forced
upon
us
few
people
realize
how
novel
is
the
almost
universal
preoccupation
with
business
which
we
can
observe
on
every
hand
but
to
which
we
are
already
so
accustomed
that
it
easily
escapes
the
casual
observer
but
in
spite
of
its
vastness
and
magnificent
achievements
business
based
upon
mass
production
and
speculative
profits
has
produced
new
evils
and
reinforced
old
ones
which
no
thoughtful
person
can
possibly
overlook
consequently
it
has
become
the
great
issue
of
our
time
the
chief
subject
of
discussion
to
be
defended
or
attacked
according
to
one
tastes
even
as
religion
and
politics
formerly
had
their
day
business
men
whether
conspicuous
in
manufacture
trade
or
finance
are
the
leading
figures
of
our
age
they
exercise
a
dominant
influence
in
domestic
and
foreign
policy
they
subsidize
our
education
and
exert
an
unmistakable
control
over
it
in
other
ages
a
military
or
religious
caste
enjoyed
a
similar
but
now
business
directs
and
equips
the
soldier
who
is
far
more
dependent
on
its
support
than
formerly
most
religious
institutions
make
easy
terms
with
business
and
far
from
interfering
with
it
or
its
teachings
on
the
whole
cordially
support
it
business
has
its
philosophy
which
it
holds
to
be
based
upon
the
immutable
traits
of
human
nature
and
as
identical
with
morality
and
patriotism
it
is
a
sensitive
intolerant
philosophy
of
which
something
will
be
said
in
the
following
section
modern
business
produced
a
sort
of
paradise
for
the
luckier
of
mankind
which
endured
down
to
the
war
and
which
many
hope
to
see
restored
in
its
former
charm
and
perhaps
further
beautified
as
the
years
go
on
it
represents
one
of
the
most
startling
of
human
achievements
no
doubt
a
great
part
of
the
population
worked
hard
and
lived
in
relative
squalor
but
even
then
they
had
many
comforts
unknown
to
the
toiling
masses
of
previous
centuries
and
were
apparently
fairly
contented
but
escape
was
possible
for
any
man
of
capacity
or
character
at
all
exceeding
the
average
into
the
middle
or
upper
classes
for
whom
life
offered
at
a
low
cost
and
with
the
least
trouble
conveniencies
comforts
and
amenities
beyond
the
compass
of
the
richest
and
most
powerful
monarchs
of
other
ages
the
inhabitant
of
london
could
order
by
telephone
sipping
his
morning
tea
in
bed
the
various
products
of
the
whole
earth
in
such
quantity
as
he
might
see
fit
and
reasonably
expect
their
early
delivery
upon
his
doorstep
he
could
at
the
same
moment
and
by
the
same
means
adventure
his
wealth
in
the
natural
resources
and
new
enterprises
of
any
quarter
of
the
world
and
share
without
exertion
or
even
trouble
in
their
prospective
fruits
and
advantages
he
could
secure
forthwith
if
he
wished
it
cheap
and
comfortable
means
of
transit
to
any
country
or
climate
without
passport
or
other
formality
could
dispatch
his
servant
to
the
neighboring
office
of
a
bank
for
such
supply
of
the
precious
metals
as
might
seem
convenient
and
could
then
proceed
abroad
to
foreign
quarters
without
knowledge
of
their
religion
language
or
customs
bearing
coined
wealth
upon
his
person
and
would
consider
himself
greatly
aggrieved
and
much
surprised
at
the
least
interference
and
most
important
of
all
he
could
before
the
war
regard
this
state
of
affairs
as
normal
certain
and
permanent
except
in
the
direction
of
further
improvement
and
any
deviation
from
it
as
aberrant
scandalous
and
avoidable
the
projects
and
politics
of
militarism
and
imperialism
of
racial
and
cultural
rivalries
of
monopolies
restrictions
and
exclusion
which
were
to
play
the
serpent
in
this
paradise
were
little
more
than
the
amusements
of
his
daily
newspaper
and
appeared
to
exercise
almost
no
influence
at
all
on
the
ordinary
course
of
social
and
economic
life
the
internationalization
of
which
was
nearly
complete
in
practice
this
assumption
of
the
permanence
and
normality
of
the
prevailing
business
system
was
much
disturbed
by
the
outcome
of
the
war
but
less
so
especially
in
this
country
than
might
have
been
expected
it
was
easy
to
argue
that
the
terrible
conflict
merely
interrupted
the
generally
beneficent
course
of
affairs
which
would
speedily
itself
when
given
an
opportunity
to
those
who
see
the
situation
in
this
light
modern
business
has
largely
solved
the
problem
of
producing
and
distributing
the
material
necessities
and
amenities
of
life
and
nothing
remains
except
to
perfect
the
system
in
detail
develop
its
further
potentialities
and
fight
tooth
and
nail
those
who
are
led
by
lack
of
personal
success
or
a
maudlin
sympathy
for
the
incompetent
to
attack
and
undermine
it
on
the
other
hand
there
were
many
before
the
war
not
themselves
suffering
conspicuously
from
the
system
who
challenged
its
beneficence
and
permanence
in
the
name
of
justice
economy
and
the
best
and
highest
interests
of
mankind
as
a
whole
since
the
war
many
more
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
business
as
now
conducted
is
not
merely
unfair
exceedingly
wasteful
and
often
highly
inexpedient
from
a
social
standpoint
but
that
from
an
historical
standpoint
it
is
intensely
unusual
unstable
complicated
unreliable
and
temporary
keynes
it
may
prove
to
be
the
chief
eccentricity
of
our
age
quite
as
impermanent
as
was
the
feudal
and
manorial
system
or
the
role
of
the
mediaeval
church
or
of
monarchs
by
the
grace
of
god
and
destined
to
undergo
changes
which
it
is
now
quite
impossible
to
forecast
in
any
case
economic
issues
are
the
chief
and
bitterest
of
our
time
it
is
in
connection
with
them
that
free
thinking
is
most
difficult
and
most
apt
to
be
misunderstood
for
they
easily
become
confused
with
the
traditional
reverences
and
sanctities
of
political
fidelity
patriotism
morality
and
even
religion
there
is
something
humiliating
about
this
situation
which
subordinates
all
the
varied
possibilities
of
life
to
its
material
prerequisites
much
as
if
we
were
again
back
in
a
stage
of
impotent
savagery
scratching
for
roots
and
looking
for
berries
and
dead
animals
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
recent
english
economists
says
with
truth
the
burden
of
our
civilization
is
not
merely
as
many
suppose
that
the
product
of
industry
is
or
its
conduct
tyrannical
or
its
operation
interrupted
by
bitter
disagreements
it
is
that
industry
itself
has
come
to
hold
a
position
of
exclusive
predominance
among
human
interests
which
no
single
interest
and
least
of
all
the
provision
of
the
material
means
of
existence
is
fit
to
occupy
like
a
hypochondriac
who
is
so
absorbed
in
the
processes
of
his
own
digestion
that
he
goes
to
the
grave
before
he
has
begun
to
live
industrialized
communities
neglect
the
very
objects
for
which
it
is
worth
while
to
acquire
riches
in
their
feverish
preoccupation
with
the
means
by
which
riches
can
be
acquired
that
obsession
by
economic
issues
is
as
local
and
transitory
as
it
is
repulsive
and
disturbing
to
future
generations
it
will
appear
as
pitiable
as
the
obsession
of
the
seventeenth
century
by
religious
quarrels
appears
indeed
it
is
less
rational
since
the
object
with
which
it
is
concerned
is
less
important
and
it
is
a
poison
which
inflames
every
wound
and
turns
each
trivial
scratch
into
a
malignant
ulcer
whatever
may
be
the
merits
of
the
conflicting
views
of
our
business
system
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
agitating
all
types
of
thoughtful
men
and
women
poets
dramatists
and
story
writers
turn
aside
from
their
old
to
play
the
role
of
economists
psychologists
biologists
chemists
engineers
are
as
never
before
striving
to
discover
the
relation
between
their
realms
of
information
and
the
general
problems
of
social
and
industrial
organization
and
here
is
a
historical
student
allowing
the
dust
to
collect
on
mediaeval
chronicles
church
histories
and
even
rationalists
once
fondly
perused
in
order
to
see
if
he
can
come
to
some
terms
with
the
profit
system
and
why
not
are
we
not
all
implicated
we
all
buy
and
many
sell
and
no
one
is
left
untouched
by
a
situation
which
can
in
two
or
three
years
halve
our
incomes
without
fault
of
ours
but
before
seeking
to
establish
the
bearing
of
the
previous
sections
of
this
volume
on
our
attitude
toward
the
puzzles
of
our
day
we
must
consider
more
carefully
the
good
reasons
commonly
urged
in
defense
of
the
existing
system
the
philosophy
of
safety
and
sanity
so
far
we
have
been
mainly
engaged
in
recalling
the
process
by
which
man
has
accumulated
such
a
mind
as
he
now
has
and
the
effects
of
this
accumulation
on
his
mode
of
life
under
former
conditions
which
are
now
passing
away
and
in
a
state
of
ignorance
about
highly
essential
matters
which
are
now
being
put
in
quite
a
new
light
he
established
certain
standards
and
practices
in
his
political
social
and
industrial
life
his
views
of
property
government
education
the
relations
of
the
sexes
and
various
other
matters
he
reaffirms
and
perpetuates
by
means
of
schools
colleges
churches
newspapers
and
magazines
which
in
order
to
be
approved
and
succeed
must
concur
in
and
ratify
these
established
standards
and
practices
and
the
current
notions
of
good
and
evil
right
and
wrong
this
is
what
happened
in
the
past
and
to
the
great
majority
of
people
this
still
seems
to
be
the
only
means
of
safeguarding
society
before
subjecting
this
attitude
of
mind
to
further
criticism
it
will
be
helpful
to
see
how
those
argue
who
fail
to
perceive
the
vicious
circle
involved
the
war
brought
with
it
a
burst
of
unwonted
and
varied
animation
those
who
had
never
extended
their
activities
beyond
the
usual
routine
of
domestic
and
professional
life
suddenly
found
themselves
participating
in
a
vast
enterprise
in
which
they
seemed
to
be
broadening
their
knowledge
and
displaying
undreamed
of
capacity
for
with
their
fellows
expressions
of
high
idealism
exalted
us
above
the
petty
cares
of
our
previous
existence
roused
new
ambitions
and
opened
up
an
exhilarating
perspective
of
possibility
and
endeavor
it
was
common
talk
that
when
the
foe
whose
criminal
lust
for
power
had
precipitated
the
mighty
tragedy
should
be
vanquished
things
would
no
longer
be
the
same
all
would
then
agree
that
war
was
the
abomination
of
abominations
the
world
would
be
made
safe
for
democracy
and
the
nations
would
unite
in
smiling
emulation
never
did
bitterer
disappointment
follow
high
hopes
all
the
old
habits
of
nationalistic
policy
reasserted
themselves
at
versailles
a
frightened
and
bankrupt
world
could
indeed
hardly
be
expected
to
exhibit
greater
intelligence
than
the
relatively
happy
and
orderly
one
which
had
five
years
earlier
allowed
its
sanctified
traditions
to
drag
it
over
the
edge
of
the
abyss
then
there
emerged
from
the
autocracy
of
the
tsars
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
and
in
hungary
and
germany
various
startling
attempts
to
revolutionize
hastily
and
excessively
that
ancient
order
which
the
hapsburg
and
hohenzollern
rulers
had
managed
to
perpetuate
in
spite
of
all
modern
novelties
the
real
character
of
these
movements
was
ill
understood
in
our
country
but
it
was
inevitable
that
with
man
animistic
tendencies
they
should
appear
as
a
sort
of
wicked
demon
or
a
deadly
contagion
which
might
attack
even
our
own
land
unless
prevented
by
timely
measures
war
had
naturally
produced
its
machinery
for
dealing
with
dissenters
sympathizers
with
the
enemy
and
those
who
deprecated
or
opposed
war
altogether
and
it
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
extend
the
repression
to
those
who
held
exceptional
or
unpopular
views
like
the
socialists
and
members
of
the
it
was
plausible
to
charge
these
associations
with
being
under
the
guidance
of
foreigners
with
pacificism
and
a
general
tendency
to
disloyalty
but
suspicion
went
further
so
as
to
embrace
members
of
a
rather
small
thoughtful
class
who
while
rarely
socialistic
were
confessedly
skeptical
in
regard
to
the
general
beneficence
of
existing
institutions
and
who
failed
to
applaud
at
just
the
right
points
to
suit
the
taste
of
the
majority
of
their
so
the
general
impression
grew
up
that
there
was
a
sort
of
widespread
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
by
violence
or
at
least
a
dangerous
tendency
to
prepare
the
way
for
such
a
disaster
or
at
any
rate
a
culpable
indifference
to
its
possibility
business
depression
reinforced
a
natural
reaction
which
had
set
in
with
the
sudden
and
somewhat
unexpected
close
of
the
war
the
unwonted
excitement
brought
on
a
national
headache
and
a
sedative
in
the
form
of
normalcy
was
proffered
by
the
republican
party
and
thankfully
accepted
by
the
country
at
large
under
these
circumstances
the
philosophy
of
safety
and
sanity
was
formulated
it
is
familiar
and
reassuring
and
puts
no
disagreeable
task
of
mental
and
emotional
readjustment
on
those
who
accept
it
hence
its
inevitable
popularity
and
obvious
soundness
and
these
are
its
presuppositions
no
nation
is
comparable
to
our
own
in
its
wealth
and
promise
in
its
freedom
and
opportunity
for
all
it
has
opened
its
gates
to
the
peoples
of
the
earth
who
have
flocked
across
the
ocean
to
escape
the
poverty
and
oppression
of
europe
from
the
scattered
colonies
of
the
period
the
united
states
has
rapidly
advanced
to
its
world
ascendancy
when
the
european
powers
had
reached
a
hopeless
stalemate
after
four
years
of
war
the
united
states
girded
on
the
sword
as
the
champion
of
liberty
and
democracy
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
brought
the
conflict
to
a
victorious
close
before
she
had
dispatched
half
the
troops
she
could
easily
have
spared
she
had
not
entered
the
conflict
with
any
motives
of
aggrandizement
or
of
territorial
extension
she
felt
her
and
could
well
afford
proudly
to
refuse
to
join
the
league
of
nations
on
the
ground
that
she
did
not
wish
to
be
involved
in
european
wrangles
or
sacrifice
a
tittle
of
her
rights
of
the
prosperity
of
the
united
states
is
to
be
attributed
largely
to
the
excellence
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
soundness
of
her
democratic
institutions
class
privileges
do
not
exist
or
at
least
are
not
recognized
everyone
has
equal
opportunity
to
rise
in
the
world
unhampered
by
the
shackles
of
european
caste
there
is
perfect
freedom
in
matters
of
religious
belief
liberty
of
speech
and
of
the
press
is
confirmed
by
both
the
federal
constitution
and
the
constitutions
of
the
various
states

and
you
can
not
fool
all
the

all
the

we
have
not

our

quota

it
would
be
too
much
to

the

protestants
have
sometimes
dreaded
a
catholic
domination
the
mormons
have
been
a
source
of
anxiety
to
timid
souls
populists
and
advocates
of
free
silver
have
seemed
to
threaten
sound
finance
on
the
other
hand
wall
street
and
the
trusts
have
led
some
to
think
that
corporate
business
enterprise
may
at
times
if
left
unhampered
lead
to
monopolies
but
the
evil
workings
of
all
these
things
had
before
the
war
been
peaceful
if
insidious
they
might
rouse
apprehension
in
the
minds
of
and
observers
but
there
had
been
no
general
fear
that
any
of
them
would
overthrow
the
republic
and
lead
to
a
violent
destruction
of
society
as
now
constituted
and
mayhap
to
a
reversion
to
barbarism
the
circumstances
of
our
participation
in
the
world
war
and
the
rise
of
bolshevism
convinced
many
for
the
first
time
that
at
last
society
and
the
republic
were
actually
threatened
heretofore
the
socialists
of
various
kinds
the
communists
and
anarchists
had
attracted
relatively
little
attention
in
our
country
except
for
the
chicago
anarchist
episode
and
the
troubles
with
the
radical
reformers
had
been
left
to
go
their
way
hold
their
meetings
and
publish
their
newspapers
and
pamphlets
with
no
great
interference
on
the
part
of
the
police
or
attention
on
the
part
of
lawgivers
with
the
progress
of
the
war
this
situation
changed
police
and
lawgivers
began
to
interfere
and
government
officials
and
guardians
of
the
public
weal
began
to
denounce
the
reds
and
those
suspected
of
radical
tendencies
the
report
of
the
lusk
committee
in
the
state
of
new
york
is
perhaps
the
most
imposing
monument
to
this
form
of
patriotic
zeal
it
is
not
our
business
here
to
discuss
the
merits
of
socialism
or
bolshevism
either
from
the
standpoint
of
their
underlying
theories
or
their
promise
in
practice
it
is
only
in
their
effects
in
developing
and
substantiating
the
philosophy
of
safety
and
sanity
that
they
concern
us
in
this
discussion
whether
the
report
of
the
lusk
committee
has
any
considerable
influence
or
no
it
well
illustrates
a
common
and
significant
frame
of
mind
and
an
habitual
method
of
reasoning
the
ostensible
aim
of
the
report
is
to
give
a
clear
unbiased
statement
and
history
of
the
purposes
and
objects
tactics
and
methods
of
the
various
forces
now
at
work
in
the
united
states
and
particularly
within
the
state
of
new
york
which
are
seeking
to
undermine
and
destroy
not
only
the
government
under
which
we
live
but
also
the
very
structure
of
american
society
it
also
seeks
to
analyze
the
various
constructive
forces
which
are
at
work
throughout
the
country
counteracting
these
evil
influences
and
to
present
the
many
industrial
and
social
problems
that
these
constructive
forces
must
meet
and
are
meeting
the
plan
is
executed
with
laborious
comprehensiveness
and
one
unacquainted
with
the
vast
and
varied
range
of
radical
utterances
will
be
overwhelmed
by
the
mass
brought
together
but
our
aim
here
is
to
consider
the
attitude
of
mind
and
assumptions
of
the
editors
and
their
sympathizers
they
admit
the
existence
of
real
grievances
and
natural
demands
of
the
working
classes
for
a
larger
share
in
the
management
and
use
of
the
common
wealth
it
is
these
grievances
and
demands
which
the
agitators
use
as
a
basis
of
their
machinations
those
bent
on
a
social
revolution
fall
into
two
classes
socialists
and
anarchists
but
while
the
groups
differ
in
detail
these
details
are
not
worth
considering
anyone
who
studies
the
propaganda
of
the
various
groups
which
we
have
named
will
learn
that
the
arguments
employed
are
the
same
that
the
tactics
advocated
can
not
be
distinguished
from
one
another
and
that
articles
or
speeches
made
on
the
question
of
tactics
or
methods
by
anarchists
could
with
propriety
be
published
in
socialist
or
communist
newspapers
without
offending
the
membership
of
these
organizations
so
fortunately
for
the
reader
it
is
unnecessary
to
make
any
distinctions
between
socialists
anarchists
communists
and
bolsheviki
they
all
have
the
common
purpose
of
overthrowing
existing
society
and
general
strikes
and
sabotage
are
the
direct
means
advocated
the
object
is
to
drive
business
into
bankruptcy
by
reducing
production
and
raising
costs
but
it
would
be
a
serious
mistake
to
assume
that
the
dangers
are
confined
to
our
industrial
system
the
very
first
general
fact
that
must
be
driven
home
to
americans
is
that
the
pacifist
movement
in
this
country
the
growth
and
connections
of
which
are
an
important
part
of
this
report
is
an
absolutely
integral
and
fundamental
part
of
international
socialism
european
socialism
from
which
ours
is
derived
has
had
for
one
of
its
main
purposes
the
creation
of
an
international
sentiment
to
supersede
national
patriotism
and
effort
and
this
internationalism
was
based
upon
pacificism
in
the
sense
that
it
opposed
all
wars
between
nations
and
developed
at
the
same
time
class
consciousness
that
was
to
culminate
in
relentless
class
warfare
in
other
words
it
was
not
really
peace
that
was
the
goal
but
the
abolition
of
the
patriotic
warlike
spirit
of
nationalities
in
view
of
the
necessity
of
making
head
against
this
menace
the
criminal
anarchy
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
was
invoked
search
warrants
issued
large
quantities
of
revolutionary
incendiary
and
seditious
written
and

were
seized
after
the
refusal
of

and
to

licenses
if
they
deem
that
an
overthrow
of
the
existing
government
by
violence
is
being
taught
but
the
safe
and
sane
philosophy
by
no
means
stops
with
the
convenient
and
compendious
identification
of
socialists
of
all
kinds
anarchists
pacificists
and
internationalists
as
belonging
to
one
threatening
group
united
in
a
attempt
to
overthrow
society
as
we
now
know
it
this
class
includes
it
may
be
observed
such
seemingly
distinguishable
personalities
as
trotzky
and
miss
jane
addams
who
are
assumed
to
be
in
essential
harmony
upon
the
great
issue
but
there
are
many
others
who
are
perhaps
the
innocent
tools
of
the
socialists
these
include
teachers
lecturers
writers
clergymen
and
editors
to
whom
the
lusk
report
devotes
a
long
section
on
the
spread
of
socialism
in
educated
circles
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
section
to
show
the
use
made
by
members
of
the
socialist
party
of
america
and
other
extreme
radicals
and
revolutionaries
of
pacifist
sentiment
among
people
of
education
and
culture
in
the
united
states
as
a
vehicle
for
the
promotion
of
revolutionary
socialistic
propaganda
the
facts
here
related
are
important
because
they
show
that
these
socialists
playing
upon
the
pacifist
sentiment
in
a
large
body
of
sincere
persons
were
able
to
organize
their
energies
and
capitalize
their
prestige
for
the
spread
of
their
doctrines
p
an
instance
of
this
is
an
article
in
the
which
includes
more
or
less
open
attacks
on
palmer
lansing
the
house
immigration
committee
the
new
york
senator
fall
this
committee
etc
it
also
quotes
the
dissenting
opinions
in
the
abrams
case
of
justices
holmes
and
brandeis
and
ends
by
making
light
of
the
danger
of
revolution
in
america
this
belittling
of
the
very
real
danger
to
the
institutions
of
this
country
as
well
as
the
attempted
discrediting
of
any
investigating
group
or
individual
has
become
thoroughly
characteristic
of
our
parlor
bolshevik
or
intelligentsia
p
so
it
comes
about
as
might
indeed
have
been
foreseen
from
the
first
that
one
finds
himself
if
not
actually
violating
the
criminal
anarchy
statute
at
least
branded
as
a
bolshevik
if
he
speaks
slightingly
of
the
new
york
or
recalls
the
dissenting
opinion
of
two
judges
of
the
supreme
court
moreover
as
might
have
been
anticipated
the
issues
prove
to
be
at
bottom
not
so
much
economic
as
moral
and
religious
for
materialism
and
its
formidable
sons
anarchy
bolshevism
and
unrest
have
thrown
down
the
gauge
of
battle
to
all
decency
what
is
of
the
greatest
importance
for
churchmen
to
understand
in
order
that
they
may
not
be
led
astray
by
specious
arguments
of
christian
socialists
and
liberals
and
partisans
of
free
speech
is
that
socialism
as
a
system
as
well
as
anarchism
and
all
its
ramifications
from
bolshevism
to
the
russian
anarchist
association
are
all
the
declared
enemies
of
religion
and
all
recognized
moral
standards
and
restraints
p
we
must
not
be
misled
by
false
specious
idealism
masquerading
as
progress
the
fight
is
one
for
god
as
well
as
country
in
which
all
forms
of
radicalism
materialism
and

be
fiercely

while
the
nature
of
this
investigation
has
led

to
lay
its
emphasis
upon
the
activities
of

it
feels
that
this
report
would
not
be
complete
if
it
did
not
state
emphatically
that
it
believes
that
those
persons
in

and
certain
owners
of
property
who
seek
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
to
reap

gain
from

in
no
small
part
to
the
social

a

the

finds

his

that
adherence

means
the
ultimate
breaking
down
of
the
old
sturdy

of

and

the
insidious
destruction
of

the
weakening
of
the
moral
fiber
of

and
the
destruction
of
the
foundations
of

it
may
seem
anomalous
to
some
that
the
defenders
of
the
old
sturdy
virtues
should
so
carelessly
brand
honest
and
thoughtful
men
and
women
of
whose
opinions
they
can
have
no
real
knowledge
as
enemies
of
the

but
there
is
nothing
whatever
anomalous
in
this

has
been
the
habit
of
defenders
of
the
sturdy
old
virtues
from
time
immemorial
to
be
careless
of

some
historical
reflections
on
the
philosophy
of
repression
of
course
the
kind
of
reasoning
and
the
presuppositions
described
in
the
previous
section
will
appeal
to
many
readers
as
an
illustration
of
excessive
and
unjustifiable
fear
lest
the
present
order
be
disturbed
a
frenzied
impulse
to
rush
to
the
defense
of
our
threatened
institutions
doubtless
the
lusk
report
may
quite
properly
be
classed
as
a
mere
episode
in
war
psychology
having
armed
to
put
down
the
germans
and
succeeded
in
so
doing
the
ardor
of
conflict
does
not
immediately
abate
but
new
enemies
are
sought
and
easily
discovered
the
hysteria
of
repression
will
probably
subside
but
it
is
now
a
fact
that
in
disease
whether
organic
or
mental
the
abnormal
and
excessive
are
but
instructive
exaggerations
and
perversions
of
the
usual
course
of
things
they
do
not
exist
by
themselves
but
represent
the
temporary
and
exaggerated
functioning
of
bodily
and
mental
processes
the
real
question
for
us
here
is
not
whether
senator
lusk
is
too
fearful
and
too
indiscriminate
in
his
denunciations
but
whether
he
and
his
colleagues
do
not
merely
furnish
an
overcharged
and
perhaps
somewhat
grotesque
instance
of
natural
and
impulsive
way
of
dealing
with
social
problems
it
seems
to
me
that
enough
has
already
been
said
to
lead
us
to
suspect
this
at
the
outset
of
this
volume
the
statement
was
hazarded
that
if
only
men
could
come
to
look
at
things
differently
from
the
way
they
now
generally
do
a
number
of
our
most
shocking
evils
would
either
remedy
themselves
or
show
themselves
subject
to
gradual
elimination
or
hopeful
reduction
among
these
evils
a
very
fundamental
one
is
the
defensive
attitude
toward
the
criticism
of
our
existing
order
and
the
naïve
tendency
to
class
critics
as
enemies
of
society
it
was
argued
that
a
fuller
understanding
of
the
history
of
the
race
would
contribute
to
that
essential
freedom
of
mind
which
would
welcome
criticism
and
permit
fair
judgments
of
its
merits
having
reviewed
the
arguments
of
those
who
would
suppress
criticism
lest
it
lead
to
violence
and
destruction
we
may
now
properly
recall
in
this
connection
certain
often
neglected
historical
facts
which
serve
to
weaken
if
not
to
discredit
most
of
these
arguments
man
has
never
been
able
to
adapt
himself
very
perfectly
to
his
civilization
and
there
has
always
been
a
deal
of
injustice
and
maladjustment
which
might
conceivably
have
been
greatly
decreased
by
intelligence
but
now
it
would
seem
that
this
chronic
distress
has
become
acute
and
some
careful
observers
express
the
quite
honest
conviction
that
unless
thought
be
raised
to
a
far
higher
plane
than
hitherto
some
great
setback
to
civilization
is
inevitable
yet
instead
of
subjecting
traditional
ideas
and
rules
to
a
thoroughgoing
reconsideration
our
impulse
is
as
we
have
seen
to
hasten
to
justify
existing
and
habitual
notions
of
human
conduct
there
are
many
who
flatter
themselves
that
by
suppressing
radical
thought
and
its
diffusion
the
present
system
can
be
made
to
work
satisfactorily
on
the
basis
of
ideas
of
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
thousand
years
ago
while
we
have
permitted
our
free
thought
in
the
natural
sciences
to
transform
man
old
world
we
allow
our
schools
and
even
our
universities
to
continue
to
inculcate
beliefs
and
ideals
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
appropriate
to
the
past
but
which
are
clearly
anachronisms
now
for
the
social
science
taught
in
our
schools
is
it
would
appear
an
orderly
presentation
of
the
conventional
proprieties
rather
than
a
summons
to
grapple
with
the
novel
and
disconcerting
facts
that
surround
us
on
every
side
at
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
century
the
sciences
of
man
despite
some
progress
are
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
much
the
same
position
that
the
natural
sciences
were
some
centuries
earlier
hobbes
says
of
the
scholastic
philosophy
that
it
went
on
one
brazen
leg
and
one
of
an
ass
this
seems
to
be
our
plight
our
scientific
leg
is
lusty
and
grows
in
strength
daily
its
fellow
member
our
thought
of
man
and
his
sorry
estate
is
capricious
and
halting
we
have
not
realized
the
hopes
of
the
illumination
when
confident
philosophers
believed
that
humanity
was
shaking
off
its
ancient
chains
that
the
clouds
of
superstition
were
lifting
and
that
with
the
new
achievements
of
science
man
would
boldly
and
rapidly
advance
toward
hitherto
concord
and
happiness
we
can
no
longer
countenance
the
specious
precision
of
the
english
classical
school
of
economics
whose
premises
have
been
given
the
lie
by
further
thought
and
experience
we
have
really
to
start
anew
the
students
of
natural
phenomena
early
realized
the
arduous
path
they
had
to
travel
they
had
to
escape
above
all
things
from
the
past
they
perceived
that
they
could
look
for
no
help
from
those
whose
special
business
it
was
to
philosophize
and
moralize
in
terms
of
the
past
they
had
to
look
for
light
in
their
own
way
and
in
the
directions
from
which
they
conjectured
it
might
come
their
first
object
was
as
bacon
put
it
not
they
had
to
learn
before
they
could
undertake
changes
and
descartes
is
very
careful
to
say
that
philosophic
doubt
was
not
to
be
carried
over
to
daily
conduct
this
should
for
the
time
being
conform
to
accepted
standards
unenlightened
as
they
might
be
such
should
be
the
frame
of
mind
of
one
who
seeks
insight
into
human
affairs
his
subject
matter
is
however
far
more
intricate
and
unmanageable
than
that
of
the
natural
scientist
experiment
on
which
natural
science
has
reared
itself
is
by
no
means
so
readily
applicable
in
studying
mankind
and
its
problems
the
student
of
humanity
has
even
more
inveterate
prejudices
to
overcome
more
inherent
and
cultivated
weaknesses
of
the
mind
to
guard
against
than
the
student
of
nature
like
the
early
scientists
he
has
a
scholastic
tradition
to
combat
he
can
look
for
little
help
from
the
universities
as
now
constituted
the
clergy
although
less
sensitive
in
regard
to
what
they
find
in
the
bible
are
still
stoutly
opposed
on
the
whole
to
any
thoroughgoing
criticism
of
the
standards
of
morality
to
which
they
are
accustomed
few
lawyers
can
view
their
profession
with
any
considerable
degree
of
detachment
then
there
are
the
now
business
interests
backed
by
the
politicians
and
in
general
supported
by
the
ecclesiastical
legal
and
educational
classes
many
of
the
newspapers
and
magazines
are
under
their
influence
since
they
are
become
the
business
man
heralds
and
live
off
his
bounty
business
indeed
has
almost
become
our
religion
it
is
defended
by
the
civil
government
even
as
the
later
roman
emperors
and
the
mediaeval
princes
protected
the
church
against
attack
socialists
and
communists
are
the
waldensians
and
albigensians
of
our
day
heretics
to
be
cast
out
suppressed
and
deported
to
russia
if
not
directly
to
hell
as
of
old
the
secret
service
seems
inclined
to
play
the
part
of
a
modern
inquisition
which
protects
our
new
religion
collected
in
its
innumerable
files
is
the
evidence
in
regard
to
suspected
heretics
who
have
dared
impugn
business
as
usual
or
who
have
dwelt
too
lovingly
on
peace
and
good
will
among
nations
books
and
pamphlets
although
no
longer
burned
by
the
common
hangman
are
forbidden
the
mails
by
somewhat
undiscerning
officials
we
have
a
pious
vocabulary
of
high
resentment
and
noble
condemnation
even
as
they
had
in
the
middle
ages
and
part
of
it
is
genuine
if
unintelligent
as
it
was
then
such
are
some
of
the
obstacles
which
the
student
of
human
affairs
must
surmount
yet
we
may
hope
that
it
will
become
increasingly
clear
that
the
repression
of
criticism
even
if
such
criticism
becomes
and
takes
the
form
of
a
denunciation
of
existing
habits
and
institutions
is
inexpedient
and
inappropriate
to
the
situation
in
which
the
world
finds
itself
let
us
assume
that
such
people
as
really
advocate
lawlessness
and
disorder
should
be
carefully
watched
and
checked
if
they
promise
to
be
a
cause
of
violence
and
destruction
but
is
it
not
possible
to
distinguish
between
them
and
those
who
question
and
even
arraign
with
some
degree
of
heat
the
standardized
unfairness
and
maladjustments
of
our
times
and
there
is
another
class
who
can
not
by
any
exaggeration
be
considered
agitators
who
have
by
taking
thought
come
to
see
that
our
conditions
have
so
altered
in
the
past
hundred
years
and
our
knowledge
so
increased
that
the
older
ways
of
doing
and
viewing
things
are
not
only
unreasonable
but
actually
dangerous
but
so
greatly
has
the
hysteria
of
war
unsettled
the
public
mind
that
even
this
latter
class
is
subject
to
discreditable
accusations
and
some
degree
of
interference
we
constantly
hear
it
charged
that
this
or
that
individual
or
group
advocates
the
violent
overthrow
of
government
is
not
loyal
to
the
constitution
or
is
openly
or
secretly
working
for
the
abolition
of
private
property
or
the
family
or
in
general
is
supposed
to
be
eager
to
overturn
everything
without
having
anything
to
put
in
its
place
the
historical
student
may
well
recommend
that
we
be
on
our
guard
against
such
accusations
brought
against
groups
and
individuals
for
the
student
of
history
finds
that
it
has
always
been
the
custom
to
charge
those
who
happened
to
be
unpopular
with
holding
beliefs
and
doing
things
which
they
neither
believed
nor
did
socrates
was
executed
for
corrupting
youth
and
infidelity
to
the
gods
jesus
for
proposing
to
overthrow
the
government
luther
was
to
the
officials
of
his
time
one
who
taught
a
loose
life
severed
from
all
laws
and
wholly
brutish
those
who
questioned
the
popular
delusions
in
regard
to
witchcraft
were
declared
by
clergymen
professors
and
judges
of
the
seventeenth
century
to
be
as
good
as
atheists
who
shed
doubt
on
the
existence
in
order
to
lead
their
godless
lives
without
fear
of
future
retribution
how
is
it
possible
in
view
of
this
inveterate
habit
of
mankind
to
accept
at
its
face
value
what
the
police
or
department
of
justice
or
investigators
choose
to
report
of
the
teachings
of
people
who
are
already
condemned
in
their
eyes
of
course
the
criticism
of
accepted
ideas
is
offensive
and
will
long
remain
so
after
all
talk
and
writing
are
forms
of
conduct
and
like
all
conduct
are
inevitably
disagreeable
when
they
depart
from
the
current
standards
of
respectable
behavior
to
talk
as
if
our
established
notions
of
religion
morality
and
property
our
ideas
of
stealing
and
killing
were
defective
and
in
need
of
revision
is
indeed
more
shocking
than
to
violate
the
current
rules
of
action
for
we
are
accustomed
to
actual
crimes
misdemeanors
and
sins
which
are
happening
all
the
time
but
we
will
not
tolerate
any
suspected
attempt
to
palliate
them
in
theory
it
is
inevitable
that
new
views
should
appear
to
the
thoughtless
to
be
justifications
or
extenuations
of
evil
actions
and
an
encouragement
of
violence
and
rebellion
and
that
they
will
accordingly
be
bitterly
denounced
but
there
is
no
reason
why
an
increase
of
intelligence
should
not
put
a
growing
number
of
us
on
our
guard
against
this
ancient
pitfall
if
we
are
courageously
to
meet
and
successfully
to
overcome
the
dangers
with
which
our
civilization
is
threatened
it
is
clear
that
we
need
than
ever
before
it
is
also
clear
that
we
can
have
indefinitely
more
mind
than
we
already
have
if
we
but
honestly
desire
it
and
avail
ourselves
of
resources
already
at
hand
mind
as
previously
defined
is
our
conscious
knowledge
and
intelligence
what
we
know
and
our
attitude
toward
it
our
disposition
to
increase
our
information
classify
it
criticize
it
and
apply
it
is
obvious
that
in
this
sense
the
mind
is
a
matter
of
accumulation
and
that
it
has
been
in
the
making
ever
since
man
took
his
first
step
in
i
have
tried
to
suggest
the
manner
in
which
man
long
history
illuminates
our
plight
and
casts
light
on
the
path
to
be
followed
and
history
is
beginning
to
take
account
of
the
knowledge
of
man
nature
and
origin
contributed
by
the
biologist
and
the
anthropologist
and
the
newer
psychologists
few
people
realize
the
hopeful
revolution
that
is
already
beginning
to
influence
the
aims
and
methods
of
all
these
sciences
of
man
no
previous
generation
of
thinkers
has
been
so
humble
on
the
whole
as
is
that
of
so
ready
to
avow
their
ignorance
and
to
recognize
the
tendency
of
each
new
discovery
to
reveal
further
complexities
in
the
problem
on
the
other
hand
we
are
justified
in
feeling
that
at
last
we
have
the
chance
to
start
afresh
we
are
freer
than
any
previous
age
from
the
various
prepossessions
and
prejudices
which
we
now
see
hampered
the
free
thinking
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
standards
and
mood
of
natural
science
are
having
an
increasing
influence
in
stimulating
eager
research
into
human
nature
beliefs
and
institutions
with
bacon
recommendations
of
the
study
of
common
the
human
mind
entered
a
new
stage
of
development
now
that
historic
forces
have
brought
the
common
to
the
fore
we
are
submitting
him
to
scientific
study
and
gaining
thereby
that
elementary
knowledge
of
his
nature
which
needs
to
be
vastly
increased
and
spread
abroad
since
it
can
form
the
only
possible
basis
for
a
successful
and
real
democracy
i
would
not
have
the
reader
infer
that
i
overrate
the
place
of
science
or
exact
knowledge
in
the
life
of
man
science
which
is
but
the
most
accurate
information
available
about
the
world
in
which
we
live
and
the
nature
of
ourselves
and
of
our
fellow
men
is
not
the
whole
of
life
and
except
to
a
few
peculiar
persons
it
can
never
be
the
most
absorbing
and
vivid
of
our
emotional
satisfactions
we
are
poetic
and
artistic
and
romantic
and
mystical
we
resent
the
cold
analysis
and
reduction
of
life
to
the
commonplace
and
well
substantiated
and
this
is
after
all
is
said
the
aim
of
scientific
endeavor
but
we
have
to
adjust
ourselves
to
a
changing
world
in
the
light
of
constantly
accumulating
knowledge
it
is
knowledge
that
has
altered
the
world
and
we
must
rely
on
knowledge
and
understanding
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
our
new
surroundings
and
establish
peace
and
order
and
security
for
the
pursuit
of
those
things
that
to
most
of
us
are
more
enticing
than
science
itself
no
previous
generation
has
been
so
perplexed
as
ours
but
none
has
ever
been
justified
in
holding
higher
hopes
if
it
could
but
reconcile
itself
to
making
bold
and
judicious
use
of
its
growing
resources
material
and
intellectual
is
fear
that
holds
us
and
fear
is
begotten
of
ignorance
and
uncertainty
and
these
mutually
reinforce
one
another
for
we
feebly
try
to
condone
our
ignorance
by
our
uncertainty
and
to
excuse
our
uncertainty
by
our
ignorance
our
hot
defense
of
our
ideas
and
beliefs
does
not
indicate
an
established
confidence
in
them
but
often
which
we
try
to
hide
from
ourselves
just
as
one
who
suffers
from
bashfulness
offsets
his
sense
of
inferiority
and
awkwardness
by
rude
aggression
if
for
example
religious
beliefs
had
been
really
firmly
established
there
would
have
been
no
need
of
aids
to
faith
and
so
with
our
business
system
our
politics
and
international
relations
we
dread
to
see
things
as
they
would
appear
if
we
thought
of
them
honestly
for
it
is
the
nature
of
critical
thought
to
metamorphose
our
familiar
and
approved
world
into
something
strange
and
unfamiliar
it
is
undoubtedly
a
nervous
sense
of
the
precariousness
of
the
existing
social
system
which
accounts
for
the
present
strenuous
opposition
to
a
fair
and
square
consideration
of
its
merits
and
defects
partisanship
is
our
great
curse
we
too
readily
assume
that
everything
has
two
sides
and
that
it
is
our
duty
to
be
on
one
or
the
other
we
must
be
defending
or
attacking
something
only
the
hide
their
natural
cowardice
by
asking
the
impudent
question
what
is
it
all
about
the
heroic
gird
on
the
armor
of
the
lord
square
their
shoulders
and
establish
a
muscular
tension
which
serves
to
dispel
doubt
and
begets
the
voluptuousness
of
bigotry
and
fanaticism
in
this
mood
questions
become
issues
of
right
and
wrong
not
of
expediency
and
inexpediency
it
has
been
said
that
the
worthy
people
of
cambridge
are
able
promptly
to
reduce
the
most
complex
social
or
economic
problem
to
a
simple
moral
issue
and
this
is
a
wile
of
the
father
of
lies
to
which
many
of
us
yield
readily
enough
it
is
however
possible
for
the
individual
to
overcome
the
fear
of
thought
once
i
was
afraid
that
men
might
think
too
much
now
i
only
dread
lest
they
will
think
too
little
and
far
too
timidly
for
i
now
see
that
real
thinking
is
rare
and
difficult
and
that
it
needs
every
incentive
in
the
face
of
innumerable
ancient
and
inherent
discouragements
and
impediments
we
must
first
endeavor
manfully
to
free
our
own
minds
and
then
do
what
we
can
to
hearten
others
to
free
theirs
de
as
members
of
a
race
that
has
required
from
five
hundred
thousand
to
a
million
years
to
reach
its
present
state
of
enlightenment
there
is
little
reason
to
think
that
anyone
of
us
is
likely
to
cultivate
intelligence
too
assiduously
or
in
harmful
excess
what
of
it
our
age
is
one
of
unprecedented
responsibility
as
lippmann
has
so
well
said
never
before
have
we
had
to
rely
so
completely
on
ourselves
no
guardian
to
think
for
us
no
precedent
to
follow
without
question
no
lawmaker
above
only
ordinary
men
set
to
deal
with
heartbreaking
perplexity
all
weakness
comes
to
the
surface
we
are
homeless
in
a
jungle
of
machines
and
untamed
powers
that
haunt
and
lure
the
imagination
of
course
our
culture
is
confused
our
thinking
spasmodic
and
our
emotion
out
of
kilter
no
mariner
ever
enters
upon
a
more
uncharted
sea
than
does
the
average
human
being
born
in
the
twentieth
century
our
ancestors
thought
they
knew
their
way
from
birth
through
all
eternity
we
are
puzzled
about
day
after
it
is
with
emancipation
that
real
tasks
begin
and
liberty
is
a
searching
challenge
for
it
takes
away
the
guardianship
of
the
master
and
the
comfort
of
the
priest
the
iconoclasts
did
not
free
us
they
threw
us
into
the
water
and
now
we
have
to
swim
we
must
look
forward
to
ever
new
predicaments
and
adventures
is
going
to
be
settled
in
the
sense
in
which
things
were
once
supposed
to
be
settled
for
the
simple
reason
that
knowledge
will
probably
continue
to
increase
and
will
inevitably
alter
the
world
with
which
we
have
to
make
the
only
thing
that
might
conceivably
remain
somewhat
stabilized
is
an
attitude
of
mind
and
unflagging
expectancy
appropriate
to
the
terms
and
the
rules
according
to
which
life
game
must
hereafter
be
played
we
must
promote
a
new
cohesion
and
on
the
basis
of
this
truth
and
this
means
that
we
have
now
to
substitute
purpose
for
tradition
and
this
is
a
concise
statement
of
the
great
revolution
which
we
face
now
when
all
human
institutions
so
slowly
and
laboriously
evolved
are
impugned
every
consensus
challenged
every
creed
flouted
as
much
as
and
perhaps
even
more
than
by
the
ancient
sophists
the
call
comes
to
us
to
explore
test
and
if
necessary
reconstruct
the
very
bases
of
conviction
for
all
open
questions
are
new
opportunities
old
beacon
lights
have
shifted
or
gone
out
some
of
the
issues
we
lately
thought
to
be
minor
have
taken
on
cosmic
dimensions
we
are
all
up
against
questions
too
big
for
us
so
that
there
is
everywhere
a
sense
of
insufficiency
which
is
too
deep
to
be
fully
deployed
in
the
narrow
field
of
consciousness
hence
there
is
a
new
discontent
with
old
leaders
standards
criteria
methods
and
values
and
a
demand
everywhere
for
new
ones
a
realization
that
mankind
must
now
reorient
itself
and
take
its
bearings
from
the
eternal
stars
and
sail
no
longer
into
the
unknown
future
by
the
dead
reckonings
of
the
past
life
in
short
has
become
a
solemn
sporting
proposition
solemn
enough
in
its
heavy
responsibilities
and
the
magnitude
of
the
stakes
to
satisfy
our
deepest
religious
longings
sporty
enough
to
tickle
the
fancy
of
a
baseball
fan
or
an
explorer
in
darkest
borneo
we
can
play
the
game
or
refuse
to
play
it
at
present
most
of
human
organization
governmental
educational
social
and
religious
is
directed
as
it
always
has
been
to
holding
things
down
and
to
perpetuating
beliefs
and
policies
which
belong
to
the
past
and
have
been
but
too
gingerly
readjusted
to
our
new
knowledge
and
new
conditions
on
the
other
hand
there
are
various
scientific
associations
which
are
bent
on
revising
and
amplifying
our
knowledge
and
are
not
pledged
to
keeping
alive
any
belief
or
method
which
can
not
stand
the
criticism
which
comes
with
further
information
the
terrible
fear
of
falling
into
mere
rationalizing
is
gradually
extending
from
the
natural
sciences
to
psychology
anthropology
politics
and
political
economy
all
this
is
a
cheering
response
to
the
new
situation
but
as
has
been
pointed
out
really
honest
discussion
of
our
social
economic
and
political
standards
and
habits
readily
takes
on
the
suspicion
of
heresy
and
infidelity
just
as
the
freethinker
who
in
the
eighteenth
century
strove
to
discredit
miracles
in
the
name
of
an
and
foreseeing
god
who
could
not
be
suspected
of
tampering
with
his
own
laws
was
accused
of
being
an
atheist
and
of
really
believing
in
no
god
at
all
so
those
who
would
ennoble
our
ideals
of
social
organization
are
described
as
intellectuals
or
parlor
bolshevists
who
would
overthrow
society
and
all
the
achievements
of
the
past
in
order
to
free
themselves
from
moral
and
religious
restraints
and
mayhap
get
something
for
nothing
the
parallel
is
very
exact
indeed
the
church
always
argued
that
there
were
no
new
heresies
all
would
on
examination
prove
to
be
old
and
discredited
so
the
of
the
united
states
has
recently
declared
that
men
have
experimented
with
radical
theories
in
great
and
small
ways
times
without
number
and
always
always
with
complete
failure
they
are
not
new
they
are
old
each
failure
has
demonstrated
anew
that
without
effort
there
is
no
success
the
race
never
gets
something
for
nothing
but
is
this
not
a
complete
reversal
of
the
obvious
truth
unless
we
define
radical
as
that
which
never
does
succeed
how
can
anyone
with
the
most
elementary
notions
of
history
fail
to
see
that
almost
all
the
things
that
we
prize
represent
revolts
against
tradition
and
were
in
their
beginnings
what
seemed
to
be
shocking
divergences
from
current
beliefs
and
practices
what
about
christianity
and
protestantism
and
constitutional
government
and
the
rejection
of
old
superstitions
and
the
acceptance
of
modern
scientific
ideas
the
race
has
always
been
getting
something
for
nothing
for
creative
thought
is
as
we
have
seen
confined
to
a
very
few
and
it
has
been
the
custom
to
discourage
or
kill
those
who
prosecuted
it
too
openly
not
to
reward
them
according
to
their
merits
one
can
not
but
wonder
at
this
constantly
recurring
phrase
getting
something
for
nothing
as
if
it
were
the
peculiar
and
perverse
ambition
of
disturbers
of
society
except
for
our
animal
outfit
practically
all
we
have
is
handed
to
us
gratis
can
the
most
complacent
reactionary
flatter
himself
that
he
invented
the
art
of
writing
or
the
printing
press
or
discovered
his
religious
economic
and
moral
convictions
or
any
of
the
devices
which
supply
him
with
meat
and
raiment
or
any
of
the
sources
of
such
pleasure
as
he
may
derive
from
literature
or
the
fine
arts
in
short
civilization
is
little
else
than
getting
something
for
nothing
like
other
vested
interests
it
is
the
legitimate
right
to
something
for
nothing
how
much
execrable
reasoning
and
how
many
stupid
accusations
would
fall
away
if
this
truth
were
accepted
as
a
basis
of
discussion
of
course
there
is
no
more
flagrant
example
of
a
systematic
endeavor
to
get
something
for
nothing
than
the
present
business
system
based
on
profits
and
absentee
ownership
of
stocks
since
the
invention
of
printing
and
indeed
long
before
those
fearful
of
change
have
attempted
to
check
criticism
by
attacking
books
these
were
classified
as
orthodox
or
heterodox
moral
or
immoral
treasonable
or
loyal
according
to
their
tone
unhappily
this
habit
continues
and
shows
itself
in
the
distinction
between
sound
and
unsound
radical
and
conservative
safe
and
dangerous
the
sensible
question
to
ask
about
a
book
is
obviously
whether
it
makes
some
contribution
to
a
clearer
understanding
of
our
situation
by
adding
or
reaffirming
important
considerations
and
the
inferences
to
be
made
from
these
such
books
could
be
set
off
against
those
that
were
but
expressions
of
vague
discontent
or
emulation
or
denunciations
of
things
because
they
are
as
they
are
or
are
not
as
they
are
not
i
have
personally
little
confidence
in
those
who
cry
lo
here
or
lo
there
it
is
premature
to
advocate
any
wide
sweeping
reconstruction
of
the
social
order
although
experiments
and
suggestions
should
not
be
discouraged
what
we
need
first
is
a
change
of
heart
and
a
chastened
mood
which
will
permit
an
ever
increasing
number
of
people
to
see
things
as
they
are
in
the
light
of
what
they
have
been
and
what
they
might
be
the
dogmatic
socialist
with
his
unhistorical
assumptions
of
class
struggle
his
exaggerated
economic
interpretation
of
history
and
his
notion
that
labor
is
the
sole
producer
of
capital
is
shedding
scarcely
more
light
on
the
actual
situation
than
is
the
lusk
committee
and
coolidge
with
their
confidence
in
the
sacredness
of
private
property
as
they
conceive
it
in
the
perennial
rightness
and
inspiration
of
existing
authority
and
the
blessedness
of
the
profit
system
but
there
are
plenty
of
writers
to
mention
only
a
few
of
the
more
recent
ones
like
veblen
dewey
j
hobson
tawney
cole
havelock
ellis
bertrand
russell
graham
wallas
who
may
or
may
not
have
or
ever
have
had
any
confidence
in
the
presuppositions
and
forecasts
of
socialism
whose
books
do
make
clearer
to
any
reader
the
painful
exigencies
of
our
own
times
i
often
think
of
the
economic
historians
of
say
two
centuries
hence
who
may
find
time
to
dig
up
the
vestiges
of
the
economic
literature
of
we
may
in
imagination
appeal
to
their
verdicts
and
in
some
cases
venture
to
forecast
them
many
of
our
writers
they
will
throw
aside
as
dominated
by
a
desire
merely
to
save
the
present
at
all
costs
others
as
attempting
to
realize
plans
which
were
already
discredited
in
their
own
day
future
historians
will
nevertheless
clearly
distinguish
a
few
who
by
a
sort
of
persistent
and
ardent
detachment
were
able
to
see
things
close
at
hand
more
fully
and
truly
than
their
fellows
and
endeavored
to
do
what
they
could
to
lead
their
fellows
to
perceive
and
reckon
with
the
facts
which
so
deeply
concerned
them
blessed
be
those
who
aspire
to
win
this
glory
on
the
monument
erected
to
bruno
on
the
site
where
he
was
burned
for
seeing
more
clearly
than
those
in
authority
in
his
days
is
the
simple
inscription
raised
to
giordano
bruno
by
the
generation
which
he
foresaw
we
are
all
purblind
but
some
are
blinder
than
others
who
use
the
various
means
available
for
sharpening
their
eyesight
as
an
onlooker
it
seems
to
me
safe
to
say
that
the
lenses
recommended
by
both
the
radicals
and
their
vivid
opponents
rather
tend
to
increase
than
diminish
our
natural
astigmatism
those
who
agree
on
the
whole
at
least
with
the
brought
together
in
this
essay
and
on
the
whole
with
the
main
suggested
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
will
properly
begin
to
wonder
how
our
educational
system
and
aims
are
to
be
so
rearranged
that
coming
generations
may
be
better
prepared
to
understand
the
condition
of
human
life
and
to
avail
themselves
of
its
possibilities
more
fully
and
guard
against
its
dangers
more
skillfully
than
previous
generations
there
is
now
widespread
discontent
with
our
present
educational
methods
and
their
elaborate
futility
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
rather
rarely
willing
to
face
the
fundamental
difficulty
for
it
is
obviously
so
very
hard
to
overcome
do
not
dare
to
be
honest
enough
to
tell
boys
and
girls
and
young
men
and
women
what
would
be
most
useful
to
them
in
an
age
of
imperative
social
we
have
seen
that
the
ostensible
aims
of
education
are
various
and
that
among
them
is
now
included
the
avowed
attempt
to
prepare
the
young
to
play
their
part
later
as
voting
citizens
if
they
are
to
do
better
than
preceding
generations
they
must
be
brought
up
differently
they
would
have
to
be
given
a
different
general
attitude
toward
institutions
and
ideals
instead
of
having
these
represented
to
them
as
standardized
and
sacred
they
should
be
taught
to
view
them
as
representing
problems
but
how
can
we
ever
expect
to
cultivate
the
judgment
of
the
young
in
matters
of
fundamental
social
economic
and
political
readjustment
when
we
consider
the
really
dominating
forces
in
education
but
even
if
these
restraints
were
weakened
or
removed
the
task
would
remain
a
very
delicate
one
even
with
teachers
free
and
far
better
informed
than
they
are
it
would
be
no
easy
thing
to
cultivate
in
the
young
a
justifiable
admiration
for
the
achievements
and
traditional
ideals
of
mankind
and
at
the
same
time
develop
the
requisite
knowledge
of
the
prevailing
abuses
culpable
stupidity
common
dishonesty
and
empty
political
buncombe
which
too
often
passes
for
statesmanship
but
the
problem
has
to
be
tackled
and
it
may
be
tackled
directly
or
indirectly
the
direct
way
would
be
to
describe
as
realistically
as
might
be
the
actual
conditions
and
methods
and
their
workings
good
and
bad
if
there
were
better
books
than
are
now
available
it
would
be
possible
for
teachers
tactfully
to
show
not
only
how
government
is
supposed
to
run
but
how
it
actually
is
run
there
are
plenty
of
reports
of
investigating
committees
federal
and
state
which
furnish
authentic
information
in
regard
to
political
corruption
graft
waste
and
incompetency
these
have
not
hitherto
been
supposed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
of
government
although
they
are
obviously
absolutely
essential
to
an
of
it
similar
reflections
suggest
themselves
in
the
matter
of
business
international
relations
and
race
animosities
but
so
long
as
our
schools
depend
on
appropriations
made
by
politicians
and
colleges
and
universities
are
largely
supported
by
business
men
or
by
the
state
and
are
under
the
control
of
those
who
are
bent
on
preserving
the
existing
system
from
criticism
it
is
hard
to
see
any
hope
of
a
kind
of
education
which
would
effectively
question
the
conventional
notions
of
government
and
business
they
can
not
be
discussed
with
sufficient
honesty
to
make
their
consideration
really
medicinal
we
laud
the
brave
and
outspoken
and
those
supposed
to
have
the
courage
of
their
convictions
but
only
when
these
convictions
are
acceptable
or
indifferent
to
us
otherwise
honesty
and
frankness
become
mere
impudence
no
doubt
politics
and
economics
could
be
taught
and
are
being
taught
better
as
time
goes
on
neither
of
them
are
so
utterly
unreal
and
irrelevant
to
human
proceedings
as
they
formerly
were
there
is
no
reason
why
a
teacher
of
political
economy
should
not
describe
the
actual
workings
of
the
profit
system
of
industry
with
its
restraints
on
production
and
its
dependence
on
the
engineer
and
suggest
the
possibility
of
gathering
together
capital
from
functionless
absentee
stockholders
on
the
basis
of
the
current
rate
of
interest
rather
than
speculative
dividends
the
actual
conditions
of
the
workers
could
be
described
their
present
precarious
state
the
inordinate
and
wasteful
prevalence
of
hiring
and
firing
the
policy
of
the
unions
and
their
defensive
and
offensive
tactics
every
youngster
might
be
given
some
glimmering
notion
that
neither
private
property
nor
capital
is
the
real
issue
since
few
question
their
essentiality
but
rather
the
new
problem
of
supplying
other
than
the
traditional
motives
for
industrial
enterprise
namely
the
docility
and
hard
compulsion
of
the
great
masses
of
workers
on
the
one
hand
and
speculative
profits
on
the
other
which
now
dominate
in
our
present
business
system
for
the
existing
organization
is
not
only
becoming
more
and
more
patently
wasteful
heartless
and
unjust
but
is
beginning
for
various
reasons
to
break
down
in
short
whatever
the
merits
of
our
present
ways
of
producing
the
material
necessities
and
amenities
of
life
it
looks
to
many
as
if
they
could
not
succeed
indefinitely
even
as
well
as
they
have
in
the
past
without
some
fundamental
revision
as
for
political
life
a
good
deal
would
be
accomplished
if
students
could
be
habituated
to
distinguish
successfully
between
the
empty
declamations
of
politicians
and
statements
of
facts
between
vague
party
programs
and
concrete
recommendations
and
proposals
they
should
early
learn
that
language
is
not
primarily
a
vehicle
of
ideas
and
information
but
an
emotional
outlet
corresponding
to
various
cooings
growlings
snarls
crowings
and
brayings
their
attention
could
be
invited
to
the
rhetoric
of
the
in
the
senate
or
the
soothing
utterances
of
harding
on
accepting
the
nomination
for
president
with
a
senate
advising
as
the
constitution
contemplates
i
would
hopefully
approach
the
nations
of
europe
and
of
the
earth
proposing
that
understanding
which
makes
us
a
willing
participant
in
the
consecration
of
nations
to
a
new
relationship
to
commit
the
moral
forces
of
the
world
america
included
to
peace
and
international
justice
still
leaving
america
free
independent
but
offering
friendship
to
all
the
world
if
men
call
for
more
specific
details
i
remind
them
that
moral
committals
are
broad
and
and
we
are
contemplating
peoples
in
the
concord
of
humanity
advancement
after
mastering
the
difference
between
language
used
to
express
facts
and
purposes
and
that
which
amounts
to
no
more
than
a
pious
ejaculation
a
suave
and
deprecating
gesture
or
an
inferential
accusation
directed
against
the
opposing
party
the
youth
should
be
instructed
in
the
theory
and
practice
of
party
fidelity
and
the
effects
of
partisanship
on
the
conduct
of
our
governmental
affairs
in
fine
he
should
get
some
notion
of
the
motives
and
methods
of
those
who
really
run
our
government
whether
he
learned
anything
else
or
not
these
attempts
to
produce
a
more
intelligently
critical
and
generation
are
however
likely
to
be
far
less
feasible
than
the
methods
partly
because
they
will
arouse
strenuous
opposition
from
the
defenders
of
society
as
now
regulated
and
partly
because
no
immediate
inspection
of
habits
and
institutions
is
so
instructive
as
a
study
of
their
origin
and
progress
and
a
comparison
of
them
with
other
forms
of
social
adjustment
i
hope
that
it
has
already
become
clear
that
we
have
great
and
hitherto
only
very
superficially
worked
resources
in
history
as
it
is
now
coming
to
be
conceived
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
intellectual
revolution
that
has
ever
overtaken
mankind
our
whole
conception
of
mind
is
undergoing
a
great
change
we
are
beginning
to
understand
its
nature
and
as
we
find
out
more
intelligence
may
be
raised
to
a
recognized
dignity
and
effectiveness
which
it
has
never
enjoyed
before
an
encouraging
beginning
has
been
made
in
the
case
of
the
natural
sciences
and
a
similar
success
may
await
the
studies
which
have
to
do
with
the
critical
estimate
of
man
complicated
nature
his
fundamental
impulses
and
resources
the
needless
and
fatal
repressions
which
these
have
suffered
through
the
ignorance
of
the
past
and
the
discovery
of
untried
ways
of
enriching
our
existence
and
improving
our
relations
with
our
fellow
men
there
is
a
passage
in
goethe
faust
where
he
likens
history
to
the
book
with
seven
seals
described
in
revelation
which
no
one
in
heaven
or
on
the
earth
or
under
the
earth
was
able
to
open
and
read
therein
all
sorts
of
guesses
have
been
hazarded
as
to
its
contents
by
augustine
orosius
otto
of
freising
bossuet
bolingbroke
voltaire
herder
hegel
and
many
others
but
none
of
them
were
able
to
break
the
seals
and
all
of
them
were
gravely
misled
by
their
fragmentary
knowledge
of
the
book
contents
for
we
now
see
that
the
seven
seals
were
seven
great
ignorances
no
one
knew
much
of
man
physical
nature
or
the
workings
of
his
thoughts
and
desires
or
of
the
world
in
which
he
lives
or
of
how
he
has
come
about
as
a
race
or
of
how
he
develops
as
an
individual
from
a
tiny
egg
or
how
deeply
and
permanently
he
is
affected
by
the
often
forgotten
impressions
of
infancy
and
childhood
or
how
his
ancestors
lived
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
in
the
dark
ignorance
of
savagery
the
seals
are
all
off
now
the
book
at
last
lies
open
before
those
who
are
capable
of
reading
it
and
few
they
be
as
yet
for
most
of
us
still
cling
to
the
guesses
made
in
regard
to
its
contents
before
anyone
knew
what
was
in
it
we
have
become
attached
to
the
familiar
old
stories
which
now
prove
to
be
fictions
and
we
find
it
hard
to
reconcile
ourselves
to
the
many
hard
sayings
which
the
book
proves
to
contain
its
constant
stress
on
the
stupidity
of
good
people
its
scorn
for
the
respectable
and
normal
which
it
often
reduces
to
little
more
than
sanctimonious
routine
and
indolence
and
pious
resentment
at
being
disturbed
in
one
complacent
assurances
indeed
much
of
its
teaching
appears
downright
immoral
according
to
existing
standards
one
awful
thing
that
the
book
of
the
past
makes
plain
is
that
with
our
animal
heritage
we
are
singularly
oblivious
to
the
large
concerns
of
life
we
are
keenly
sensitive
to
little
discomforts
minor
irritations
wounded
vanity
and
various
danger
signals
but
our
comprehension
is
inherently
vague
and
listless
when
it
comes
to
grasping
intricate
situations
and
establishing
anything
like
a
fair
perspective
in
life
problems
and
possibilities
our
imagination
is
restrained
by
our
own
timidity
constantly
reinforced
by
the
warnings
of
our
fellows
who
are
always
urging
us
to
be
safe
and
sane
by
which
they
mean
convenient
for
them
predictable
in
our
conduct
and
graciously
amenable
to
the
prevailing
standards
but
it
is
obvious
that
it
is
increasingly
dangerous
to
yield
to
this
inveterate
tendency
however
comfortable
and
respectable
it
may
seem
for
the
moment
history
as
wells
has
so
finely
expressed
it
is
coming
more
and
more
to
be
a
race
between
education
and
catastrophe
our
internal
policies
and
our
economic
and
social
ideas
are
profoundly
vitiated
at
present
by
wrong
and
fantastic
ideas
of
the
origin
and
historical
relationship
of
social
classes
a
sense
of
history
as
the
common
adventure
of
all
mankind
is
as
necessary
for
peace
within
as
it
is
for
peace
between
the
nations
there
can
be
no
secure
peace
now
but
a
common
peace
of
the
whole
world
no
prosperity
but
a
general
prosperity
and
this
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
are
all
now
brought
so
near
together
and
are
so
pathetically
and
intricately
interdependent
that
the
old
notions
of
noble
isolation
and
national
sovereignty
are
magnificently
criminal
in
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
or
the
depths
of
their
unconscious
do
not
the
conservatively
minded
realize
that
their
whole
attitude
toward
the
world
and
its
betterment
is
based
on
an
assumption
that
finds
no
least
support
in
the
great
book
of
the
past
does
it
not
make
plain
that
the
conservative
so
far
as
he
is
consistent
and
lives
up
to
his
professions
is
fatally
in
the
wrong
the
radical
is
also
almost
always
wrong
for
no
one
can
foresee
the
future
but
he
works
on
a
right
assumption
namely
that
the
future
has
so
far
always
proved
different
from
the
past
and
that
it
will
continue
to
do
so
some
of
us
indeed
see
that
the
future
is
tending
to
become
more
and
more
rapidly
and
widely
different
from
the
past
the
conservative
himself
furnishes
the
only
illustration
of
his
theory
and
even
that
is
highly
inconclusive
his
general
frame
of
mind
appears
to
remain
constant
but
he
finds
himself
defending
and
rejecting
very
different
things
the
great
issue
may
according
to
the
period
be
a
primeval
taboo
the
utterances
of
the
delphic
oracle
the
athanasian
creed
the
inquisition
the
geocentric
theory
monarchy
by
the
grace
of
god
witchcraft
slavery
war
capitalism
private
property
or
noble
isolation
all
of
these
tend
to
appear
to
the
conservative
under
the
aspect
of
eternity
but
all
of
these
things
have
come
many
of
them
have
gone
and
the
remainder
would
seem
to
be
subject
to
modifications
as
time
goes
on
this
is
the
teaching
of
the
now
unsealed
book
notes
james
branch
cabell
has
in
his
defended
romantic
longings
and
inexorable
craving
to
live
part
of
the
time
at
least
in
a
world
far
more
sweetly
molded
to
his
fancy
than
that
of
natural
science
and
political
economy
there
is
no
reason
why
man
should
live
by
bread
alone
there
is
a
time
however
for
natural
science
and
political
economy
for
they
should
establish
the
conditions
in
which
we
may
rejoice
in
our
vital
lies
which
will
then
do
no
harm
and
bring
much
joy
the
relation
of
our
kinesthesia
or
muscular
sense
to
fanaticism
on
the
one
hand
and
freedom
of
mind
on
the
other
is
a
matter
now
beginning
to
be
studied

important

which
permeate

appendix
some
suggestions
in
regard
to
reading
it
may
happen
that
among
the
readers
of
this
essay
there
will
be
some
who
will
ask
how
they
can
most
readily
get
a
clearer
idea
of
the
various
newer
ways
of
looking
at
mankind
and
the
problems
of
the
day
the
following
list
of
titles
is
furnished
with
a
view
of
doing
something
to
meet
this
demand
it
is
not
a
bibliography
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
term
it
is
confined
to
rather
short
and
readily
understandable
presentations
appropriate
to
the
overcrowded
schedule
upon
which
most
of
us
have
to
operate
all
the
writers
mentioned
belong
however
to
that
rather
small
class
whose
opinions
are
worth
considering
even
if
one
reserves
the
imprescriptible
right
not
to
agree
with
all
they
say
there
may
well
be
better
references
than
those
with
which
i
happen
to
be
acquainted
and
others
quite
as
useful
but
i
can
hardly
imagine
anyone
whatever
his
degree
of
information
unless
he
happens
to
be
a
specialist
in
the
particular
field
failing
to
gain
something
of
value
from
any
one
of
the
volumes
mentioned
for
the
astounding
revelations
in
regard
to
the
fundamental
nature

the

in
which

there
would
be
no
unanimity
of
opinion
among

somewhat
familiar
with

as
to
what
