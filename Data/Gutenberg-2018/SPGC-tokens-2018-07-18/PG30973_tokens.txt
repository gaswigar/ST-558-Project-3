up
to
their
necks
with
only
their
heads
out

the
man
gave
him
a
pair
of
snow
shoes
the
king
went
into
the
castle
and
at
first
his
queen
did
know
him
he
was
so
wan
and
thin

wandering
so
far
and
being
so
woeful

he
took

when
he
got

there
stood
the
wolf
waiting

he
had
walked

day

so
a
strange
man
met
him

the
man
but
still
the
horse
begged
him
to
look
behind
him
and
this
time
she
whisked
off
the
wig
and
there
lay
the
lad
so
lovely
and
white
and
red
just
as
the
princess
had
seen
him
in
the
morning
sun
the
lad
in
the
battle
the
three
princesses
in
the
blue
mountain
just
as
they
bent
down
to
take
the
rose
a
big
dense
snowdrift
came
and
carried
them
away
the
troll
was
quite
willing
and
before
long
he
fell
asleep
and
began
snoring
as
soon
as
they
tugged
at
the
rope
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
pulled
up
the
princesses
the
one
after
the
other
no
sooner
had
he
whistled
than
he
heard
a
whizzing
and
a
whirring
from
all
quarters
and
such
a
large
flock
of
birds
swept
down
that
they
blackened
all
the
field
in
which
they
settled
east
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
moon
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
poor
husbandman
who
had
so
many
children
that
he
had
much
of
either
food
or
clothing
to
give
them
pretty
children
they
all
were
but
the
prettiest
was
the
youngest
daughter
who
was
so
lovely
there
was
no
end
to
her
loveliness
so
one
day
was
on
a
thursday
evening
late
at
the
fall
of
the
year
the
weather
was
so
wild
and
rough
outside
and
it
was
so
cruelly
dark
and
rain
fell
and
wind
blew
till
the
walls
of
the
cottage
shook
again
there
they
all
sat
round
the
fire
busy
with
this
thing
and
that
but
just
then
all
at
once
something
gave
three
taps
on
the
then
the
father
went
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
when
he
got
out
of
doors
what
should
he
see
but
a
great
big
to
you
said
the
the
same
to
you
said
the
man
will
you
give
me
your
youngest
daughter
if
you
will
i
make
you
as
rich
as
you
are
now
poor
said
the
well
the
man
would
not
be
at
all
sorry
to
be
so
rich
but
still
he
thought
he
must
have
a
bit
of
a
talk
with
his
daughter
first
so
he
went
in
and
told
them
how
there
was
a
great
waiting
outside
who
had
given
his
word
to
make
them
so
rich
if
he
could
only
have
the
youngest
daughter
the
lassie
said
no
outright
nothing
could
get
her
to
say
anything
else
so
the
man
went
out
and
settled
it
with
the
that
he
should
come
again
the
next
thursday
evening
and
get
an
answer
meantime
he
talked
his
daughter
over
and
kept
on
telling
her
of
all
the
riches
they
would
get
and
how
well
off
she
would
be
herself
and
so
at
last
she
thought
better
of
it
and
washed
and
mended
her
rags
made
herself
as
smart
as
she
could
and
was
ready
to
start
i
say
her
packing
gave
her
much
trouble
illustration
well
mind
and
hold
tight
by
my
shaggy
coat
and
then
there
nothing
to
fear
said
the
bear
so
she
rode
a
long
long
way
next
thursday
evening
came
the
to
fetch
her
and
she
got
upon
his
back
with
her
bundle
and
off
they
went
so
when
they
had
gone
a
bit
of
the
way
the
said
are
you
afraid
no
she
was
well
mind
and
hold
tight
by
my
shaggy
coat
and
then
nothing
to
fear
said
the
so
she
rode
a
long
long
way
till
they
came
to
a
great
steep
hill
there
on
the
face
of
it
the
gave
a
knock
and
a
door
opened
and
they
came
into
a
castle
where
there
were
many
rooms
all
lit
up
rooms
gleaming
with
silver
and
gold
and
there
too
was
a
table
ready
laid
and
it
was
all
as
grand
as
grand
could
be
then
the
gave
her
a
silver
bell
and
when
she
wanted
anything
she
was
only
to
ring
it
and
she
would
get
it
at
once
well
after
she
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
evening
wore
on
she
got
sleepy
after
her
journey
and
thought
she
would
like
to
go
to
bed
so
she
rang
the
bell
and
she
had
scarce
taken
hold
of
it
before
she
came
into
a
chamber
where
there
was
a
bed
made
as
fair
and
white
as
any
one
would
wish
to
sleep
in
with
silken
pillows
and
curtains
and
gold
fringe
all
that
was
in
the
room
was
gold
or
silver
but
when
she
had
gone
to
bed
and
put
out
the
light
a
man
came
and
laid
himself
alongside
her
that
was
the
who
threw
off
his
beast
shape
at
night
but
she
never
saw
him
for
he
always
came
after
she
had
put
out
the
light
and
before
the
day
dawned
he
was
up
and
off
again
so
things
went
on
happily
for
a
while
but
at
last
she
began
to
get
silent
and
sorrowful
for
there
she
went
about
all
day
alone
and
she
longed
to
go
home
to
see
her
father
and
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
so
one
day
when
the
asked
what
it
was
that
she
lacked
she
said
it
was
so
dull
and
lonely
there
and
how
she
longed
to
go
home
to
see
her
father
and
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
and
that
was
why
she
was
so
sad
and
sorrowful
because
she
could
get
to
them
well
well
said
the
perhaps
there
a
cure
for
all
this
but
you
must
promise
me
one
thing
not
to
talk
alone
with
your
mother
but
only
when
the
rest
are
by
to
hear
for
she
take
you
by
the
hand
and
try
to
lead
you
into
a
room
alone
to
talk
but
you
must
mind
and
not
do
that
else
you
bring
bad
luck
on
both
of
us
so
one
sunday
the
came
and
said
now
they
could
set
off
to
see
her
father
and
mother
well
off
they
started
she
sitting
on
his
back
and
they
went
far
and
long
at
last
they
came
to
a
grand
house
and
there
her
brothers
and
sisters
were
running
about
out
of
doors
at
play
and
everything
was
so
pretty
was
a
joy
to
see
this
is
where
your
father
and
mother
live
now
said
the
but
do
forget
what
i
told
you
else
you
make
us
both
unlucky
no
bless
her
she
not
forget
and
when
she
had
reached
the
house
the
turned
right
about
and
left
her
then
when
she
went
in
to
see
her
father
and
mother
there
was
such
joy
there
was
no
end
to
it
none
of
them
thought
they
could
thank
her
enough
for
all
she
had
done
for
them
now
they
had
everything
they
wished
as
good
as
good
could
be
and
they
all
wanted
to
know
how
she
got
on
where
she
lived
well
she
said
it
was
very
good
to
live
where
she
did
she
had
all
she
wished
what
she
said
beside
i
do
know
but
i
do
think
any
of
them
had
the
right
end
of
the
stick
or
that
they
got
much
out
of
her
but
so
in
the
afternoon
after
they
had
done
dinner
all
happened
as
the
had
said
her
mother
wanted
to
talk
with
her
alone
in
her
bedroom
but
she
minded
what
the
had
said
and
would
go
upstairs
oh
what
we
have
to
talk
about
will
keep
she
said
and
put
her
mother
off
but
somehow
or
other
her
mother
got
round
her
at
last
and
she
had
to
tell
her
the
whole
story
so
she
said
how
every
night
when
she
had
gone
to
bed
a
man
came
and
lay
down
beside
her
as
soon
as
she
had
put
out
the
light
and
how
she
never
saw
him
because
he
was
always
up
and
away
before
the
morning
dawned
and
how
she
went
about
woeful
and
sorrowing
for
she
thought
she
should
so
like
to
see
him
and
how
all
day
long
she
walked
about
there
alone
and
how
dull
and
dreary
and
lonesome
it
was
my
said
her
mother
it
may
well
be
a
troll
you
slept
with
but
now
i
teach
you
a
lesson
how
to
set
eyes
on
him
i
give
you
a
bit
of
candle
which
you
can
carry
home
in
your
bosom
just
light
that
while
he
is
asleep
but
take
care
not
to
drop
the
tallow
on
him
yes
she
took
the
candle
and
hid
it
in
her
bosom
and
as
night
drew
on
the
came
and
fetched
her
away
but
when
they
had
gone
a
bit
of
the
way
the
asked
if
all
had
happened
as
he
had
said
well
she
could
say
it
had
now
mind
said
he
if
you
have
listened
to
your
mother
advice
you
have
brought
bad
luck
on
us
both
and
then
all
that
has
passed
between
us
will
be
as
nothing
no
she
said
she
had
listened
to
her
mother
advice
so
when
she
reached
home
and
had
gone
to
bed
it
was
the
old
story
over
again
there
came
a
man
and
lay
down
beside
her
but
at
dead
of
night
when
she
heard
he
slept
she
got
up
and
struck
a
light
lit
the
candle
and
let
the
light
shine
on
him
and
so
she
saw
that
he
was
the
loveliest
one
ever
set
eyes
on
and
she
fell
so
deep
in
love
with
him
on
the
spot
that
she
thought
she
could
live
if
she
give
him
a
kiss
there
and
then
and
so
she
did
but
as
she
kissed
him
she
dropped
three
hot
drops
of
tallow
on
his
shirt
and
he
woke
up
what
have
you
done
he
cried
now
you
have
made
us
both
unlucky
for
had
you
held
out
only
this
one
year
i
had
been
freed
for
i
have
a
who
has
bewitched
me
so
that
i
am
a
by
day
and
a
by
night
but
now
all
ties
are
snapt
between
us
now
i
must
set
off
from
you
to
her
she
lives
in
a
castle
which
stands
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
and
there
too
is
a
with
a
nose
three
ells
long
and
she
the
wife
i
must
have
now
she
wept
and
took
it
ill
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
go
he
must
then
she
asked
if
she
might
go
with
him
no
she
might
tell
me
the
way
then
she
said
and
i
search
you
out
surely
i
may
get
leave
to
do
illustration
tell
me
the
way
then
she
said
and
i
search
you
out
yes
she
might
do
that
he
said
but
there
was
no
way
to
that
place
it
lay
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
and
thither
she
never
find
her
way
so
next
morning
when
she
woke
up
both
and
castle
were
gone
and
then
she
lay
on
a
little
green
patch
in
the
midst
of
the
gloomy
thick
wood
and
by
her
side
lay
the
same
bundle
of
rags
she
had
brought
with
her
from
her
old
home
illustration
and
then
she
lay
on
a
little
green
patch
in
the
midst
of
the
gloomy
thick
wood
so
when
she
had
rubbed
the
sleep
out
of
her
eyes
and
wept
till
she
was
tired
she
set
out
on
her
way
and
walked
many
many
days
till
she
came
to
a
lofty
crag
under
it
sat
an
old
hag
and
played
with
a
gold
apple
which
she
tossed
about
here
the
lassie
asked
if
she
knew
the
way
to
the
prince
who
lived
with
his
in
the
castle
that
lay
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
and
who
was
to
marry
the
with
a
nose
three
ells
long
how
did
you
come
to
know
about
him
asked
the
old
hag
but
maybe
you
are
the
lassie
who
ought
to
have
had
him
yes
she
was
so
so
it
you
is
it
said
the
old
hag
well
all
i
know
about
him
is
that
he
lives
in
the
castle
that
lies
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
and
thither
you
come
late
or
never
but
still
you
may
have
the
loan
of
my
horse
and
on
him
you
can
ride
to
my
next
neighbour
maybe
she
be
able
to
tell
you
and
when
you
get
there
just
give
the
horse
a
switch
under
the
left
ear
and
beg
him
to
be
off
home
and
stay
this
gold
apple
you
may
take
with
you
so
she
got
upon
the
horse
and
rode
a
long
long
time
till
she
came
to
another
crag
under
which
sat
another
old
hag
with
a
gold
here
the
lassie
asked
if
she
knew
the
way
to
the
castle
that
lay
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
and
she
answered
like
the
first
old
hag
that
she
knew
nothing
about
it
except
it
was
east
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
moon
and
thither
you
come
late
or
never
but
you
shall
have
the
loan
of
my
horse
to
my
next
neighbour
maybe
she
tell
you
all
about
it
and
when
you
get
there
just
switch
the
horse
under
the
left
ear
and
beg
him
to
be
off
home
and
this
old
hag
gave
her
the
golden
it
might
be
find
some
use
for
it
she
said
so
the
lassie
got
up
on
the
horse
and
rode
a
far
far
way
and
a
weary
time
and
so
at
last
she
came
to
another
great
crag
under
which
sat
another
old
hag
spinning
with
a
golden
her
too
she
asked
if
she
knew
the
way
to
the
and
where
the
castle
was
that
lay
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
so
it
was
the
same
thing
over
again
maybe
it
you
who
ought
to
have
had
the
said
the
old
hag
yes
it
was
but
she
too
did
know
the
way
a
bit
better
than
the
other
two
east
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
moon
it
was
she
knew
that
was
all
and
thither
you
come
late
or
never
but
i
lend
you
my
horse
and
then
i
think
you
best
ride
to
the
east
wind
and
ask
him
maybe
he
knows
those
parts
and
can
blow
you
thither
but
when
you
get
to
him
you
need
only
give
the
horse
a
switch
under
the
left
ear
and
he
trot
home
of
himself
and
so
too
she
gave
her
the
gold
maybe
you
find
a
use
for
it
said
the
old
hag
then
on
she
rode
many
many
days
a
weary
time
before
she
got
to
the
east
wind
house
but
at
last
she
did
reach
it
and
then
she
asked
the
east
wind
if
he
could
tell
her
the
way
to
the
who
dwelt
east
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
moon
yes
the
east
wind
had
often
heard
tell
of
it
the
and
the
castle
but
he
could
tell
the
way
for
he
had
never
blown
so
far
but
if
you
will
i
go
with
you
to
my
brother
the
west
wind
maybe
he
knows
for
he
much
stronger
so
if
you
will
just
get
on
my
back
i
carry
you
thither
yes
she
got
on
his
back
and
i
should
just
think
they
went
briskly
along
so
when
they
got
there
they
went
into
the
west
wind
house
and
the
east
wind
said
the
lassie
he
had
brought
was
the
one
who
ought
to
have
had
the
who
lived
in
the
castle
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
and
so
she
had
set
out
to
seek
him
and
how
he
had
come
with
her
and
would
be
glad
to
know
if
the
west
wind
knew
how
to
get
to
the
castle
nay
said
the
west
wind
so
far
i
never
blown
but
if
you
will
i
go
with
you
to
our
brother
the
south
wind
for
he
much
stronger
than
either
of
us
and
he
has
flapped
his
wings
far
and
wide
maybe
he
tell
you
you
can
get
on
my
back
and
i
carry
you
to
him
yes
she
got
on
his
back
and
so
they
travelled
to
the
south
wind
and
were
so
very
long
on
the
way
i
should
think
when
they
got
there
the
west
wind
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
her
the
way
to
the
castle
that
lay
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
for
it
was
she
who
ought
to
have
had
the
who
lived
there
you
do
say
so
that
she
is
it
said
the
south
wind
well
i
have
blustered
about
in
most
places
in
my
time
but
so
far
have
i
never
blown
but
if
you
will
i
take
you
to
my
brother
the
north
wind
he
is
the
oldest
and
strongest
of
the
whole
lot
of
us
and
if
he
do
know
where
it
is
you
never
find
any
one
in
the
world
to
tell
you
you
can
get
on
my
back
and
i
carry
you
thither
yes
she
got
on
his
back
and
away
he
went
from
his
house
at
a
fine
rate
and
this
time
too
she
was
long
on
her
way
so
when
they
got
to
the
north
wind
house
he
was
so
wild
and
cross
cold
puffs
came
from
him
a
long
way
off
blast
you
both
what
do
you
want
he
roared
out
to
them
ever
so
far
off
so
that
it
struck
them
with
an
icy
shiver
well
said
the
south
wind
you
need
be
so
for
here
i
am
your
brother
the
south
wind
and
here
is
the
lassie
who
ought
to
have
had
the
who
dwells
in
the
castle
that
lies
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
and
now
she
wants
to
ask
you
if
you
ever
were
there
and
can
tell
her
the
way
for
she
would
be
so
glad
to
find
him
again
yes
i
know
well
enough
where
it
is
said
the
north
wind
once
in
my
life
i
blew
an
thither
but
i
was
so
tired
i
blow
a
puff
for
ever
so
many
days
after
but
if
you
really
wish
to
go
thither
and
are
afraid
to
come
along
with
me
i
take
you
on
my
back
and
see
if
i
can
blow
you
thither
yes
with
all
her
heart
she
must
and
would
get
thither
if
it
were
possible
in
any
way
and
as
for
fear
however
madly
he
went
she
would
be
at
all
afraid
very
well
then
said
the
north
wind
but
you
must
sleep
here
for
we
must
have
the
whole
day
before
us
if
we
to
get
thither
at
all
early
next
morning
the
north
wind
woke
her
and
puffed
himself
up
and
blew
himself
out
and
made
himself
so
stout
and
big
was
gruesome
to
look
at
him
and
so
off
they
went
high
up
through
the
air
as
if
they
would
never
stop
till
they
got
to
the
world
end
down
here
below
there
was
such
a
storm
it
threw
down
long
tracts
of
wood
and
many
houses
and
when
it
swept
over
the
great
sea
ships
foundered
by
hundreds
illustration
the
north
wind
goes
over
the
sea
so
they
tore
on
and
on
no
one
can
believe
how
far
they
went
and
all
the
while
they
still
went
over
the
sea
and
the
north
wind
got
more
and
more
weary
and
so
out
of
breath
he
could
scarce
bring
out
a
puff
and
his
wings
drooped
and
drooped
till
at
last
he
sunk
so
low
that
the
crests
of
the
waves
dashed
over
his
heels
are
you
afraid
said
the
north
wind
no
she
was
but
they
were
very
far
from
land
and
the
north
wind
had
still
so
much
strength
left
in
him
that
he
managed
to
throw
her
up
on
the
shore
under
the
windows
of
the
castle
which
lay
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
but
then
he
was
so
weak
and
worn
out
he
had
to
stay
there
and
rest
many
days
before
he
could
get
home
again
next
morning
the
lassie
sat
down
under
the
castle
window
and
began
to
play
with
the
gold
apple
and
the
first
person
she
saw
was
the
who
was
to
have
the
what
do
you
want
for
your
gold
apple
you
lassie
said
the
and
threw
up
the
window
it
not
for
sale
for
gold
or
money
said
the
lassie
if
it
not
for
sale
for
gold
or
money
what
is
it
that
you
will
sell
it
for
you
may
name
your
own
price
said
the
well
if
i
may
get
to
the
who
lives
here
and
be
with
him
you
shall
have
it
said
the
lassie
whom
the
north
wind
had
brought
yes
she
might
that
could
be
done
so
the
got
the
gold
apple
but
when
the
lassie
came
up
to
the
at
night
he
was
fast
asleep
she
called
him
and
shook
him
and
between
whiles
she
wept
sore
but
all
she
could
do
she
could
wake
him
up
next
morning
as
soon
as
day
broke
came
the
with
the
long
nose
and
drove
her
out
again
so
in
the
daytime
she
sat
down
under
the
castle
windows
and
began
to
card
with
her
and
the
same
thing
happened
the
asked
what
she
wanted
for
it
and
she
said
it
was
for
sale
for
gold
or
money
but
if
she
might
get
leave
to
go
up
to
the
and
be
with
him
that
night
the
should
have
it
but
when
she
went
up
she
found
him
fast
asleep
again
and
all
she
called
and
all
she
shook
and
wept
and
prayed
she
could
get
life
into
him
and
as
soon
as
the
first
gray
peep
of
day
came
then
came
the
with
the
long
nose
and
chased
her
out
again
so
in
the
daytime
the
lassie
sat
down
outside
under
the
castle
window
and
began
to
spin
with
her
golden
and
that
too
the
with
the
long
nose
wanted
to
have
so
she
threw
up
the
window
and
asked
what
she
wanted
for
it
the
lassie
said
as
she
had
said
twice
before
it
was
for
sale
for
gold
or
money
but
if
she
might
go
up
to
the
who
was
there
and
be
with
him
alone
that
night
she
might
have
it
yes
she
might
do
that
and
welcome
but
now
you
must
know
there
were
some
christian
folk
who
had
been
carried
off
thither
and
as
they
sat
in
their
room
which
was
next
the
they
had
heard
how
a
woman
had
been
in
there
and
wept
and
prayed
and
called
to
him
two
nights
running
and
they
told
that
to
the
that
evening
when
the
came
with
her
sleepy
drink
the
made
as
if
he
drank
but
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
for
he
could
guess
it
was
a
sleepy
drink
so
when
the
lassie
came
in
she
found
the
wide
awake
and
then
she
told
him
the
whole
story
how
she
had
come
thither
ah
said
the
you
just
come
in
the
very
nick
of
time
for
is
to
be
our
but
now
i
wo
have
the
and
you
are
the
only
woman
in
the
world
who
can
set
me
free
i
say
i
want
to
see
what
my
wife
is
fit
for
and
beg
her
to
wash
the
shirt
which
has
the
three
spots
of
tallow
on
it
she
say
yes
for
she
does
know
is
you
who
put
them
there
but
that
a
work
only
for
christian
folk
and
not
for
such
a
pack
of
trolls
and
so
i
say
that
i
wo
have
any
other
for
my
bride
than
the
woman
who
can
wash
them
out
and
ask
you
to
do
it
so
there
was
great
joy
and
love
between
them
all
that
night
but
next
day
when
the
wedding
was
to
be
the
said
first
of
all
i
like
to
see
what
my
bride
is
fit
for
yes
said
the
with
all
her
heart
well
said
the
i
got
a
fine
shirt
which
i
like
for
my
wedding
shirt
but
somehow
or
other
it
has
got
three
spots
of
tallow
on
it
which
i
must
have
washed
out
and
i
have
sworn
never
to
take
any
other
bride
than
the
woman
who
able
to
do
that
if
she
ca
she
not
worth
having
well
that
was
no
great
thing
they
said
so
they
agreed
and
she
with
the
began
to
wash
away
as
hard
as
she
could
but
the
more
she
rubbed
and
scrubbed
the
bigger
the
spots
grew
ah
said
the
old
hag
her
mother
you
ca
wash
let
me
try
but
she
had
long
taken
the
shirt
in
hand
before
it
got
far
worse
than
ever
and
with
all
her
rubbing
and
wringing
and
scrubbing
the
spots
grew
bigger
and
blacker
and
the
darker
and
uglier
was
the
shirt
then
all
the
other
trolls
began
to
wash
but
the
longer
it
lasted
the
blacker
and
uglier
the
shirt
grew
till
at
last
it
was
as
black
all
over
as
if
it
had
been
up
the
chimney
ah
said
the
you
none
of
you
worth
a
straw
you
why
there
outside
sits
a
beggar
lassie
i
be
bound
she
knows
how
to
wash
better
than
the
whole
lot
of
you
come
in
lassie
he
shouted
well
in
she
came
can
you
wash
this
shirt
clean
lassie
you
said
he
i
do
know
she
said
but
i
think
i
can
and
almost
before
she
had
taken
it
and
dipped
it
in
the
water
it
was
as
white
as
driven
snow
and
whiter
still
yes
you
are
the
lassie
for
me
said
the
at
that
the
old
hag
flew
into
such
a
rage
she
burst
on
the
spot
and
the
with
the
long
nose
after
her
and
the
whole
pack
of
trolls
after
her
at
least
i
never
heard
a
word
about
them
since
as
for
the
and
they
set
free
all
the
poor
christian
folk
who
had
been
carried
off
and
shut
up
there
and
they
took
with
them
all
the
silver
and
gold
and
flitted
away
as
far
as
they
could
from
the
castle
that
lay
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
illustration
and
flitted
away
as
far
as
they
could
from
the
castle
that
lay
east
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
moon
the
blue
belt
once
on
a
time
there
was
an
old
who
had
gone
out
to
beg
she
had
a
little
lad
with
her
and
when
she
had
got
her
bag
full
she
struck
across
the
hills
towards
her
own
home
so
when
they
had
gone
a
bit
up
the
they
came
upon
a
little
which
lay
where
two
paths
met
and
the
lad
asked
his
mother
leave
to
pick
it
up
no
said
she
maybe
there
witchcraft
in
it
and
so
with
threats
she
forced
him
to
follow
her
but
when
they
had
gone
a
bit
further
the
lad
said
he
must
turn
aside
a
moment
out
of
the
road
and
meanwhile
his
mother
sat
down
on
a
but
the
lad
was
a
long
time
gone
for
as
soon
as
he
got
so
far
into
the
wood
that
the
old
dame
could
not
see
him
he
ran
off
to
where
the
lay
took
it
up
tied
it
round
his
waist
and
lo
he
felt
as
strong
as
if
he
could
lift
the
whole
hill
when
he
got
back
the
old
dame
was
in
a
great
rage
and
wanted
to
know
what
he
had
been
doing
all
that
while
you
do
care
how
much
time
you
waste
and
yet
you
know
the
night
is
drawing
on
and
we
must
cross
the
hill
before
it
is
dark
so
on
they
tramped
but
when
they
had
got
about
the
old
dame
grew
weary
and
said
she
must
rest
under
a
bush
dear
mother
said
the
lad
may
i
just
go
up
to
the
top
of
this
high
crag
while
you
rest
and
try
if
i
ca
see
some
sign
of
folk
hereabouts
yes
he
might
do
that
so
when
he
had
got
to
the
top
he
saw
a
light
shining
from
the
north
so
he
ran
down
and
told
his
mother
we
must
get
on
mother
we
are
near
a
house
for
i
see
a
bright
light
shining
quite
close
to
us
in
the
north
then
she
rose
and
shouldered
her
bag
and
set
off
to
see
but
they
had
gone
far
before
there
stood
a
steep
spur
of
the
hill
right
across
their
path
just
as
i
thought
said
the
old
dame
now
we
ca
go
a
step
farther
a
pretty
bed
we
shall
have
here
but
the
lad
took
the
bag
under
one
arm
and
his
mother
under
the
other
and
ran
straight
up
the
steep
crag
with
them
now
do
you
see
do
you
see
that
we
are
close
to
a
house
you
see
that
bright
light
but
the
old
dame
said
those
were
no
christian
folk
but
for
she
was
at
home
in
all
that
forest
far
and
near
and
knew
there
was
not
a
living
soul
in
it
until
you
were
well
over
the
ridge
and
had
come
down
on
the
other
side
but
they
went
on
and
in
a
little
while
they
came
to
a
great
house
which
was
all
painted
red
what
the
good
said
the
old
dame
we
dare
go
in
for
here
the
live
do
say
so
we
must
go
in
there
must
be
men
where
the
lights
shine
so
said
the
lad
so
in
he
went
and
his
mother
after
him
but
he
had
scarce
opened
the
door
before
she
swooned
away
for
there
she
saw
a
great
stout
man
at
least
twenty
feet
high
sitting
on
the
bench
good
evening
grandfather
said
the
lad
well
here
i
sat
three
hundred
years
said
the
man
who
sat
on
the
bench
and
no
one
has
ever
come
and
called
me
grandfather
before
then
the
lad
sat
down
by
the
man
side
and
began
to
talk
to
him
as
if
they
had
been
old
friends
but
what
come
over
your
mother
said
the
man
after
they
had
chatted
a
while
i
think
she
swooned
away
you
had
better
look
after
her
so
the
lad
went
and
took
hold
of
the
old
dame
and
dragged
her
up
the
hall
along
the
floor
that
brought
her
to
herself
and
she
kicked
and
scratched
and
flung
herself
about
and
at
last
sat
down
upon
a
heap
of
firewood
in
the
corner
but
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
scarce
dared
to
look
one
in
the
face
after
a
while
the
lad
asked
if
they
could
spend
the
night
there
yes
to
be
sure
said
the
man
so
they
went
on
talking
again
but
the
lad
soon
got
hungry
and
wanted
to
know
if
they
could
get
food
as
well
as
lodging
of
course
said
the
man
that
might
be
got
too
and
after
he
had
sat
a
while
longer
he
rose
up
and
threw
six
loads
of
dry
on
the
fire
this
made
the
old
hag
still
more
afraid
oh
now
he
going
to
roast
us
alive
she
said
in
the
corner
where
she
sat
and
when
the
wood
had
burned
down
to
glowing
embers
up
got
the
man
and
strode
out
of
his
house
heaven
bless
and
help
us
what
a
stout
heart
you
have
got
said
the
old
dame
do
you
see
we
have
got
amongst
stuff
and
nonsense
said
the
lad
no
harm
if
we
have
in
a
little
while
back
came
the
man
with
an
ox
so
fat
and
big
the
lad
had
never
seen
its
like
and
he
gave
it
one
blow
with
his
fist
under
the
ear
and
down
it
fell
dead
on
the
floor
when
that
was
done
he
took
it
up
by
all
the
four
legs
and
laid
it
on
the
glowing
embers
and
turned
it
and
twisted
it
about
till
it
was
burnt
brown
outside
after
that
he
went
to
a
cupboard
and
took
out
a
great
silver
dish
and
laid
the
ox
on
it
and
the
dish
was
so
big
that
none
of
the
ox
hung
over
on
any
side
this
he
put
on
the
table
and
then
he
went
down
into
the
cellar
and
fetched
a
cask
of
wine
knocked
out
the
head
and
put
the
cask
on
the
table
together
with
two
knives
which
were
each
six
feet
long
when
this
was
done
he
bade
them
go
and
sit
down
to
supper
and
eat
so
they
went
the
lad
first
and
the
old
dame
after
but
she
began
to
whimper
and
wail
and
to
wonder
how
she
should
ever
use
such
knives
but
her
son
seized
one
and
began
to
cut
slices
out
of
the
thigh
of
the
ox
which
he
placed
before
his
mother
and
when
they
had
eaten
a
bit
he
took
up
the
cask
with
both
hands
and
lifted
it
down
to
the
floor
then
he
told
his
mother
to
come
and
drink
but
it
was
still
so
high
she
could
reach
up
to
it
so
he
caught
her
up
and
held
her
up
to
the
edge
of
the
cask
while
she
drank
as
for
himself
he
clambered
up
and
hung
down
like
a
cat
inside
the
cask
while
he
drank
so
when
he
had
quenched
his
thirst
he
took
up
the
cask
and
put
it
back
on
the
table
and
thanked
the
man
for
the
good
meal
and
told
his
mother
to
come
and
thank
him
too
and
though
she
was
she
dared
do
nothing
else
but
thank
the
man
then
the
lad
sat
down
again
alongside
the
man
and
began
to
gossip
and
after
they
had
sat
a
while
the
man
said
well
i
must
just
go
and
get
a
bit
of
supper
too
and
so
he
went
to
the
table
and
ate
up
the
whole
ox
hoofs
and
horns
and
all
and
drained
the
cask
to
the
last
drop
and
then
went
back
and
sat
on
the
bench
as
for
beds
he
said
i
do
know
what
to
be
done
i
only
got
one
bed
and
a
cradle
but
we
could
get
on
pretty
well
if
you
would
sleep
in
the
cradle
and
then
your
mother
might
lie
in
the
bed
yonder
thank
you
kindly
that
do
nicely
said
the
lad
and
with
that
he
pulled
off
his
clothes
and
lay
down
in
the
cradle
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
was
quite
as
big
as
a
as
for
the
old
dame
she
had
to
follow
the
man
who
showed
her
to
bed
though
she
was
out
of
her
wits
for
fear
well
thought
the
lad
to
himself
never
do
to
go
to
sleep
yet
i
best
lie
awake
and
listen
how
things
go
as
the
night
wears
on
so
after
a
while
the
man
began
to
talk
to
the
old
dame
and
at
last
he
said
we
two
might
live
here
so
happily
together
could
we
only
be
rid
of
this
son
of
yours
but
do
you
know
how
to
settle
him
is
that
what
you
thinking
of
said
she
nothing
easier
said
he
at
any
rate
he
would
try
he
would
just
say
he
wished
the
old
dame
would
stay
and
keep
house
for
him
a
day
or
two
and
then
he
would
take
the
lad
out
with
him
up
the
hill
to
quarry
and
roll
down
a
great
rock
on
him
all
this
the
lad
lay
and
listened
to
next
day
the
for
it
was
a
as
clear
as
day
asked
if
the
old
dame
would
stay
and
keep
house
for
him
a
few
days
and
as
the
day
went
on
he
took
a
great
iron
crowbar
and
asked
the
lad
if
he
had
a
mind
to
go
with
him
up
the
hill
and
quarry
a
few
with
all
his
heart
he
said
and
went
with
him
and
so
after
they
had
split
a
few
stones
the
wanted
him
to
go
down
below
and
look
after
cracks
in
the
rock
and
while
he
was
doing
this
the
worked
away
and
wearied
himself
with
his
crowbar
till
he
moved
a
whole
crag
out
of
its
bed
which
came
rolling
right
down
on
the
place
where
the
lad
was
but
he
held
it
up
till
he
could
get
on
one
side
and
then
let
it
roll
on
oh
said
the
lad
to
the
now
i
see
what
you
mean
to
do
with
me
you
want
to
crush
me
to
death
so
just
go
down
yourself
and
look
after
the
cracks
and
refts
in
the
rock
and
i
stand
up
above
the
did
not
dare
to
do
otherwise
than
the
lad
bade
him
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
the
lad
rolled
down
a
great
rock
which
fell
upon
the
and
broke
one
of
his
thighs
well
you
in
a
sad
plight
said
the
lad
as
he
strode
down
lifted
up
the
rock
and
set
the
man
free
after
that
he
had
to
put
him
on
his
back
and
carry
him
home
so
he
ran
with
him
as
fast
as
a
horse
and
shook
him
so
that
the
screamed
and
screeched
as
if
a
knife
were
run
into
him
and
when
he
got
home
they
had
to
put
the
to
bed
and
there
he
lay
in
a
sad
pickle
when
the
night
wore
on
the
began
to
talk
to
the
old
dame
again
and
to
wonder
how
ever
they
could
be
rid
of
the
lad
well
said
the
old
dame
if
you
ca
hit
on
a
plan
to
get
rid
of
him
i
sure
i
ca
let
me
see
said
the
i
got
twelve
lions
in
a
garden
if
they
could
only
get
hold
of
the
lad
they
soon
tear
him
to
pieces
so
the
old
dame
said
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
get
him
there
she
would
sham
sick
and
say
she
felt
so
poorly
nothing
would
do
her
any
good
but
lion
milk
all
that
the
lad
lay
and
listened
to
and
when
he
got
up
in
the
morning
his
mother
said
she
was
worse
than
she
looked
and
she
thought
she
should
never
be
right
again
unless
she
could
get
some
lion
milk
then
i
afraid
you
be
poorly
a
long
time
mother
said
the
lad
for
i
sure
i
do
know
where
any
is
to
be
got
oh
if
that
be
all
said
the
there
no
lack
of
milk
if
we
only
had
the
man
to
fetch
it
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
how
his
brother
had
a
garden
with
twelve
lions
in
it
and
how
the
lad
might
have
the
key
if
he
had
a
mind
to
milk
the
lions
so
the
lad
took
the
key
and
a
milking
pail
and
strode
off
and
when
he
unlocked
the
gate
and
got
into
the
garden
there
stood
all
the
twelve
lions
on
their
rampant
and
roaring
at
him
but
the
lad
laid
hold
of
the
biggest
and
led
him
about
by
the
and
dashed
him
against
stocks
and
stones
till
there
was
a
bit
of
him
left
but
the
two
paws
so
when
the
rest
saw
that
they
were
so
afraid
that
they
crept
up
and
lay
at
his
feet
like
so
many
curs
after
that
they
followed
him
about
wherever
he
went
and
when
he
got
home
they
lay
down
outside
the
house
with
their
on
the
door
sill
now
mother
you
soon
be
well
said
the
lad
when
he
went
in
for
here
is
the
lion
milk
he
had
just
milked
a
drop
in
the
pail
but
the
as
he
lay
in
bed
swore
it
was
all
a
lie
he
was
sure
the
lad
was
not
the
man
to
milk
lions
when
the
lad
heard
that
he
forced
the
to
get
out
of
bed
threw
open
the
door
and
all
the
lions
rose
up
and
seized
the
and
at
last
the
lad
had
to
make
them
leave
their
hold
that
night
the
began
to
talk
to
the
old
dame
again
i
sure
i
ca
tell
how
to
put
this
lad
out
of
the
way
he
is
so
awfully
strong
ca
you
think
of
some
way
no
said
the
old
dame
if
you
ca
tell
i
sure
i
ca
well
said
the
i
have
two
brothers
in
a
castle
they
are
twelve
times
as
strong
as
i
am
and
that
why
i
was
turned
out
and
had
to
put
up
with
this
farm
they
hold
that
castle
and
round
it
there
is
an
orchard
with
apples
in
it
and
whoever
eats
those
apples
sleeps
for
three
days
and
three
nights
if
we
could
only
get
the
lad
to
go
for
the
fruit
he
would
be
able
to
keep
from
tasting
the
apples
and
as
soon
as
ever
he
fell
asleep
my
brothers
would
tear
him
in
pieces
the
old
dame
said
she
would
sham
sick
and
say
she
could
never
be
herself
again
unless
she
tasted
those
apples
for
she
had
set
her
heart
on
them
all
this
the
lad
lay
and
listened
to
when
the
morning
came
the
old
dame
was
so
poorly
that
she
utter
a
word
but
groans
and
sighs
she
was
sure
she
should
never
be
well
again
unless
she
had
some
of
those
apples
that
grew
in
the
orchard
near
the
castle
where
the
man
brothers
lived
only
she
had
no
one
to
send
for
them
oh
the
lad
was
ready
to
go
that
instant
but
the
eleven
lions
went
with
him
so
when
he
came
to
the
orchard
he
climbed
up
into
the
apple
tree
and
ate
as
many
apples
as
he
could
and
he
had
scarce
got
down
before
he
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
but
the
lions
all
lay
round
him
in
a
ring
the
third
day
came
the
brothers
but
they
did
not
come
in
man
shape
they
came
snorting
like
steeds
and
wondered
who
it
was
that
dared
to
be
there
and
said
they
would
tear
him
to
pieces
so
small
that
there
should
not
be
a
bit
of
him
left
but
up
rose
the
lions
and
tore
the
into
small
pieces
so
that
the
place
looked
as
if
a
dung
heap
had
been
tossed
about
it
and
when
they
had
finished
the
they
lay
down
again
the
lad
did
not
wake
till
late
in
the
afternoon
and
when
he
got
on
his
knees
and
rubbed
the
sleep
out
of
his
eyes
he
began
to
wonder
what
had
been
going
on
when
he
saw
the
marks
of
hoofs
but
when
he
went
towards
the
castle
a
maiden
looked
out
of
a
window
who
had
seen
all
that
had
happened
and
she
said
you
may
thank
your
stars
you
were
in
that
tussle
else
you
must
have
lost
your
life
what
i
lose
my
life
no
fear
of
that
i
think
said
the
lad
so
she
begged
him
to
come
in
that
she
might
talk
with
him
for
she
had
seen
a
christian
soul
ever
since
she
came
there
but
when
she
opened
the
door
the
lions
wanted
to
go
in
too
but
she
got
so
frightened
that
she
began
to
scream
and
so
the
lad
let
them
lie
outside
then
the
two
talked
and
talked
and
the
lad
asked
how
it
came
that
she
who
was
so
lovely
could
put
up
with
those
ugly
she
never
wished
it
she
said
was
quite
against
her
will
they
had
seized
her
by
force
and
she
was
the
king
of
daughter
so
they
talked
on
and
at
last
she
asked
him
what
he
would
do
whether
she
should
go
back
home
or
whether
he
would
have
her
to
wife
of
course
he
would
have
her
and
she
should
go
home
after
that
they
went
round
the
castle
and
at
last
they
came
to
a
great
hall
where
the
two
great
swords
hung
high
up
on
the
wall
i
wonder
if
you
are
man
enough
to
wield
one
of
these
said
the
who
i
said
the
lad
be
a
pretty
thing
if
i
could
wield
one
of
these
with
that
he
put
two
or
three
chairs
one
of
the
other
jumped
up
and
touched
the
biggest
sword
with
his
finger
tips
tossed
it
up
in
the
air
and
caught
it
again
by
the
hilt
leapt
down
and
at
the
same
time
dealt
such
a
blow
with
it
on
the
floor
that
the
whole
hall
shook
after
he
had
thus
got
down
he
thrust
the
sword
under
his
arm
and
carried
it
about
with
him
so
when
they
had
lived
a
little
while
in
the
castle
the
thought
she
ought
to
go
home
to
her
parents
and
let
them
know
what
had
become
of
her
so
they
loaded
a
ship
and
she
set
sail
from
the
castle
after
she
had
gone
and
the
lad
had
wandered
about
a
little
he
called
to
mind
that
he
had
been
sent
out
on
an
errand
thither
and
had
come
to
fetch
something
for
his
mother
health
and
though
he
said
to
himself
after
all
the
old
dame
was
not
so
bad
but
she
all
right
by
this
time
still
he
thought
he
ought
to
go
and
just
see
how
she
was
so
he
went
and
found
both
the
man
and
his
mother
quite
fresh
and
hearty
what
wretches
you
are
to
live
in
this
beggarly
hut
said
the
lad
come
with
me
up
to
my
castle
and
you
shall
see
what
a
fine
fellow
i
am
well
they
were
both
ready
to
go
and
on
the
way
his
mother
talked
to
him
and
asked
how
it
was
he
had
got
so
strong
if
you
must
know
it
came
of
that
blue
belt
which
lay
on
the
that
time
when
you
and
i
were
out
begging
said
the
lad
have
you
got
it
still
asked
she
yes
he
had
it
was
tied
round
his
waist
might
she
see
it
yes
she
might
and
with
that
he
pulled
open
his
waistcoat
and
shirt
to
show
it
to
her
then
she
seized
it
with
both
hands
tore
it
off
and
twisted
it
round
her
fist
now
she
cried
what
shall
i
do
with
such
a
wretch
as
you
just
give
you
one
blow
and
dash
your
brains
out
far
too
good
a
death
for
such
a
scamp
said
the
no
first
burn
out
his
eyes
and
then
turn
him
adrift
in
a
little
boat
so
they
burned
out
his
eyes
and
turned
him
adrift
in
spite
of
his
prayers
and
tears
but
as
the
boat
drifted
the
lions
swam
after
and
at
last
they
laid
hold
of
it
and
dragged
it
ashore
on
an
island
and
placed
the
lad
under
a
fir
tree
they
caught
game
for
him
and
they
plucked
the
birds
and
made
him
a
bed
of
down
but
he
was
forced
to
eat
his
meat
raw
and
he
was
blind
at
last
one
day
the
biggest
lion
was
chasing
a
hare
which
was
blind
for
it
ran
straight
over
stock
and
stone
and
the
end
was
it
ran
right
up
against
a
and
tumbled
head
over
heels
across
the
field
right
into
a
spring
but
lo
when
it
came
out
of
the
spring
it
saw
its
way
quite
plain
and
so
saved
its
life
so
so
thought
the
lion
and
went
and
dragged
the
lad
to
the
spring
and
dipped
him
over
head
and
ears
in
it
so
when
he
had
got
his
sight
again
he
went
down
to
the
shore
and
made
signs
to
the
lions
that
they
should
all
lie
close
together
like
a
raft
then
he
stood
upon
their
backs
while
they
swam
with
him
to
the
mainland
when
he
had
reached
the
shore
he
went
up
into
a
birchen
copse
and
made
the
lions
lie
quiet
then
he
stole
up
to
the
castle
like
a
thief
to
see
if
he
could
lay
hands
on
his
belt
and
when
he
got
to
the
door
he
peeped
through
the
keyhole
and
there
he
saw
his
belt
hanging
up
over
a
door
in
the
kitchen
so
he
crept
softly
in
across
the
floor
for
there
was
no
one
there
but
as
soon
as
he
had
got
hold
of
the
belt
he
began
to
kick
and
stamp
about
as
though
he
were
mad
just
then
his
mother
came
rushing
out
dear
heart
my
darling
little
boy
do
give
me
the
belt
again
she
said
thank
you
kindly
said
he
now
you
shall
have
the
doom
you
passed
on
me
and
he
fulfilled
it
on
the
spot
when
the
old
heard
that
he
came
in
and
begged
and
prayed
so
prettily
that
he
might
not
be
smitten
to
death
well
you
may
live
said
the
lad
but
you
shall
undergo
the
same
punishment
you
gave
me
and
so
he
burned
out
the
eyes
and
turned
him
adrift
on
the
sea
in
a
little
boat
but
he
had
no
lions
to
follow
him
now
the
lad
was
all
alone
and
he
went
about
longing
and
longing
for
the
at
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
must
set
out
to
seek
her
his
heart
was
so
bent
on
having
her
so
he
loaded
four
ships
and
set
sail
for
arabia
for
some
time
they
had
fair
wind
and
fine
weather
but
after
that
they
lay
under
a
rocky
island
so
the
sailors
went
ashore
and
strolled
about
to
spend
the
time
and
there
they
found
a
huge
egg
almost
as
big
as
a
little
house
so
they
began
to
knock
it
about
with
large
stones
but
after
all
they
could
crack
the
shell
then
the
lad
came
up
with
his
sword
to
see
what
all
the
noise
was
about
and
when
he
saw
the
egg
he
thought
it
a
trifle
to
crack
it
so
he
gave
it
one
blow
and
the
egg
split
and
out
came
a
chicken
as
big
as
an
elephant
now
we
have
done
wrong
said
the
lad
this
can
cost
us
all
our
lives
and
then
he
asked
his
sailors
if
they
were
men
enough
to
sail
to
arabia
in
hours
if
they
got
a
fine
breeze
yes
they
were
good
to
do
that
they
said
so
they
set
sail
with
a
fine
breeze
and
got
to
arabia
in
hours
as
soon
as
they
landed
the
lad
ordered
all
the
sailors
to
go
and
bury
themselves
up
to
the
eyes
in
a
sandhill
so
that
they
could
barely
see
the
ships
the
lad
and
the
captains
climbed
a
high
crag
and
sate
down
under
a
fir
in
a
little
while
came
a
great
bird
flying
with
an
island
in
its
claws
and
let
it
fall
down
on
the
fleet
and
sunk
every
ship
after
it
had
done
that
it
flew
up
to
the
sandhill
and
flapped
its
wings
so
that
the
wind
nearly
took
off
the
heads
of
the
sailors
and
it
flew
past
the
fir
with
such
force
that
it
turned
the
lad
right
about
but
he
was
ready
with
his
sword
and
gave
the
bird
one
blow
and
brought
it
down
dead
after
that
he
went
to
the
town
where
every
one
was
glad
because
the
had
got
his
daughter
back
but
now
the
had
hidden
her
away
somewhere
himself
and
promised
her
hand
as
a
reward
to
any
one
who
could
find
her
and
this
though
she
was
betrothed
before
now
as
the
lad
went
along
he
met
a
man
who
had
white
for
sale
so
he
bought
one
of
the
hides
and
put
it
on
and
one
of
the
captains
was
to
take
an
iron
chain
and
lead
him
about
and
so
he
went
into
the
town
and
began
to
play
pranks
at
last
the
news
came
to
the
ears
that
there
never
had
been
such
fun
in
the
town
before
for
here
was
a
white
bear
that
danced
and
cut
capers
just
as
it
was
bid
so
a
messenger
came
to
say
the
bear
must
come
to
the
castle
at
once
for
the
wanted
to
see
its
tricks
so
when
it
got
to
the
castle
every
one
was
afraid
for
such
a
beast
they
had
never
seen
before
but
the
captain
said
there
was
no
danger
unless
they
laughed
at
it
they
must
do
that
else
it
would
tear
them
to
pieces
when
the
heard
that
he
warned
all
the
court
not
to
laugh
but
while
the
fun
was
going
on
in
came
one
of
the
maids
and
began
to
laugh
and
make
game
of
the
bear
and
the
bear
flew
at
her
and
tore
her
so
that
there
was
scarce
a
rag
of
her
left
then
all
the
court
began
to
bewail
and
the
captain
most
of
all
stuff
and
nonsense
said
the
she
only
a
maid
besides
it
more
my
affair
than
yours
when
the
show
was
over
it
was
late
at
night
it
no
good
your
going
away
when
it
so
late
said
the
the
bear
had
best
sleep
here
perhaps
it
might
sleep
in
the
ingle
by
the
kitchen
fire
said
the
captain
nay
said
the
it
shall
sleep
up
here
and
it
shall
have
pillows
and
cushions
to
sleep
on
so
a
whole
heap
of
pillows
and
cushions
was
brought
and
the
captain
had
a
bed
in
a
side
room
but
at
midnight
the
came
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
and
a
big
bunch
of
keys
and
carried
off
the
white
bear
he
passed
along
gallery
after
gallery
through
doors
and
rooms
and
till
at
last
he
came
to
a
pier
which
ran
out
into
the
sea
then
the
began
to
pull
and
haul
at
posts
and
pins
this
one
up
and
that
one
down
till
at
last
a
little
house
floated
up
to
the
water
edge
there
he
kept
his
daughter
for
she
was
so
dear
to
him
that
he
had
hid
her
so
that
no
one
could
find
her
out
he
left
the
white
bear
outside
while
he
went
in
and
told
her
how
it
had
danced
and
played
its
pranks
she
said
she
was
afraid
and
dared
not
look
at
it
but
he
talked
her
over
saying
there
was
no
danger
if
she
only
would
laugh
so
they
brought
the
bear
in
and
locked
the
door
and
it
danced
and
played
its
tricks
but
just
when
the
fun
was
at
its
height
the
maid
began
to
laugh
then
the
lad
flew
at
her
and
tore
her
to
bits
and
the
began
to
cry
and
sob
stuff
and
nonsense
cried
the
all
this
fuss
about
a
maid
i
get
you
just
as
good
a
one
again
but
now
i
think
the
bear
had
best
stay
here
till
morning
for
i
do
care
to
have
to
go
and
lead
it
along
all
those
galleries
and
stairs
at
this
time
of
night
well
said
the
if
it
sleeps
here
i
sure
i
wo
illustration
the
lad
in
the
bear
skin
and
the
king
of
daughter
but
just
then
the
bear
curled
himself
up
and
lay
down
by
the
stove
and
it
was
settled
at
last
that
the
should
sleep
there
too
with
a
light
burning
but
as
soon
as
the
had
well
gone
the
white
bear
came
and
begged
her
to
undo
his
collar
the
was
so
scared
she
almost
swooned
away
but
she
felt
about
till
she
found
the
collar
and
she
had
scarce
undone
it
before
the
bear
pulled
his
head
off
then
she
knew
him
again
and
was
so
glad
there
was
no
end
to
her
joy
and
she
wanted
to
tell
her
father
at
once
that
her
deliverer
was
come
but
the
lad
would
not
hear
of
it
he
would
earn
her
once
more
he
said
so
in
the
morning
when
they
heard
the
rattling
at
the
posts
outside
the
lad
drew
on
the
hide
and
lay
down
by
the
stove
well
has
it
lain
still
the
king
asked
i
should
think
so
said
the
it
has
so
much
as
turned
or
stretched
itself
once
when
they
got
up
to
the
castle
again
the
captain
took
the
bear
and
led
it
away
and
then
the
lad
threw
off
the
hide
and
went
to
a
tailor
and
ordered
clothes
fit
for
a
prince
and
when
they
were
fitted
on
he
went
to
the
and
said
he
wanted
to
find
the
you
not
the
first
who
has
wished
the
same
thing
said
the
but
they
have
all
lost
their
lives
for
if
any
one
who
tries
find
her
in
hours
his
life
is
forfeited
yes
the
lad
knew
all
that
still
he
wished
to
try
and
if
he
could
find
her
was
his
now
in
the
castle
there
was
a
band
that
played
sweet
tunes
and
there
were
fair
maids
to
dance
with
and
so
the
lad
danced
away
when
twelve
hours
were
gone
the
said
i
pity
you
with
all
my
heart
you
so
poor
a
hand
at
seeking
you
will
surely
lose
your
life
stuff
said
the
lad
while
there
life
there
hope
so
long
as
there
breath
in
the
body
there
no
fear
we
have
lots
of
time
and
so
he
went
on
dancing
till
there
was
only
one
hour
left
then
he
said
he
would
begin
to
search
it
no
use
now
said
the
time
up
light
your
lamp
out
with
your
big
bunch
of
keys
said
the
lad
and
follow
me
whither
i
wish
to
go
there
is
still
a
whole
hour
left
so
the
lad
went
the
same
way
which
the
had
led
him
the
night
before
and
he
bade
the
unlock
door
after
door
till
they
came
down
to
the
pier
which
ran
out
into
the
sea
it
all
no
use
i
tell
you
said
the
time
up
and
this
will
only
lead
you
right
out
into
the
sea
still
five
minutes
more
said
the
lad
as
he
pulled
and
pushed
at
the
posts
and
pins
and
the
house
floated
up
now
the
time
is
up
bawled
the
come
hither
headsman
and
take
off
his
head
nay
nay
said
the
lad
stop
a
bit
there
are
still
three
minutes
out
with
the
key
and
let
me
get
into
this
house
but
there
stood
the
and
fumbled
with
his
keys
to
draw
out
the
time
at
last
he
said
he
had
any
key
well
if
you
have
i
said
the
lad
as
he
gave
the
door
such
a
kick
that
it
flew
to
splinters
inwards
on
the
floor
at
the
door
the
met
him
and
told
her
father
this
was
her
deliverer
on
whom
her
heart
was
set
so
she
had
him
and
this
was
how
the
beggar
boy
came
to
marry
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
arabia
prince
lindworm
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
fine
young
who
was
married
to
the
loveliest
of
queens
they
were
exceedingly
happy
all
but
for
one
thing
they
had
no
children
and
this
often
made
them
both
sad
because
the
wanted
a
dear
little
child
to
play
with
and
the
wanted
an
heir
to
the
kingdom
one
day
the
went
out
for
a
walk
by
herself
and
she
met
an
ugly
old
woman
the
old
woman
was
just
like
a
witch
but
she
was
a
nice
kind
of
witch
not
the
cantankerous
sort
she
said
why
do
you
look
so
doleful
pretty
lady

no
use

telling

answered
the
nobody

the
world

the
old
woman
just

let
me
hear
what
your
trouble
is
and
maybe
i
can
put
things
right
my
dear
woman
how
can
you
said
the
and
she
told
her
the
and
i
have
no
children
that
why
i
am
so
distressed
well
you
need
be
said
the
old
witch
i
can
set
that
right
in
a
twinkling
if
only
you
will
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
listen
at
sunset
take
a
little
with
two
ears
that
is
handles
and
put
it
bottom
upwards
on
the
ground
in
the
corner
of
your
garden
then
go
and
lift
it
up
morning
at
sunrise
and
you
will
find
two
roses
underneath
it
one
red
and
one
white
if
you
eat
the
red
rose
a
little
boy
will
be
born
to
you
if
you
eat
the
white
rose
a
little
girl
will
be
sent
but
whatever
you
do
you
must
eat
the
roses
or
you
be
sorry
that
i
warn
you
only
one
remember
that
thank
you
a
thousand
times
said
the
this
is
good
news
indeed
and
she
wanted
to
give
the
old
woman
her
gold
ring
but
the
old
woman
take
it
so
the
went
home
and
did
as
she
had
been
told
and
next
morning
at
sunrise
she
stole
out
into
the
garden
and
lifted
up
the
little
she
surprised
for
indeed
she
had
hardly
expected
to
see
anything
but
there
were
the
two
roses
underneath
it
one
red
and
one
white
and
now
she
was
dreadfully
puzzled
for
she
did
not
know
which
to
choose
if
i
choose
the
red
one
she
thought
and
i
have
a
little
boy
he
may
grow
up
and
go
to
the
wars
and
get
killed
but
if
i
choose
the
white
one
and
have
a
little
girl
she
will
stay
at
home
awhile
with
us
but
later
on
she
will
get
married
and
go
away
and
leave
us
so
whichever
it
is
we
may
be
left
with
no
child
after
all
however
at
last
she
decided
on
the
white
rose
and
she
ate
it
and
it
tasted
so
sweet
that
she
took
and
ate
the
red
one
too
without
ever
remembering
the
old
woman
solemn
warning
some
time
after
this
the
went
away
to
the
wars
and
while
he
was
still
away
the
became
the
mother
of
twins
one
was
a
lovely
and
the
other
was
a
or
serpent
she
was
terribly
frightened
when
she
saw
the
but
he
wriggled
away
out
of
the
room
and
nobody
seemed
to
have
seen
him
but
herself
so
that
she
thought
it
must
have
been
a
dream
the
baby
was
so
beautiful
and
so
healthy
the
was
full
of
joy
and
likewise
as
you
may
suppose
was
the
when
he
came
home
and
found
his
son
and
heir
not
a
word
was
said
by
anyone
about
the
only
the
thought
about
it
now
and
then
many
days
and
years
passed
by
and
the
baby
grew
up
into
a
handsome
young
and
it
was
time
that
he
got
married
the
sent
him
off
to
visit
foreign
kingdoms
in
the
royal
coach
with
six
white
horses
to
look
for
a
princess
grand
enough
to
be
his
wife
but
at
the
very
first
the
way
was
stopped
by
an
enormous
enough
to
frighten
the
bravest
he
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
a
great
wide
open
mouth
and
cried
a
bride
for
me
before
a
bride
for
you
then
the
made
the
coach
turn
round
and
try
another
road
but
it
was
all
no
use
for
at
the
first
there
lay
the
again
crying
out
a
bride
for
me
before
a
bride
for
you
so
the
had
to
turn
back
home
again
to
the
castle
and
give
up
his
visits
to
the
foreign
kingdoms
and
his
mother
the
had
to
confess
that
what
the
said
was
true
for
he
was
really
the
eldest
of
her
twins
and
so
he
ought
to
have
a
wedding
first
there
seemed
nothing
for
it
but
to
find
a
bride
for
the
if
his
younger
brother
the
were
to
be
married
at
all
so
the
wrote
to
a
distant
country
and
asked
for
a
princess
to
marry
his
son
but
of
course
he
did
say
which
son
and
presently
a
princess
arrived
but
she
was
allowed
to
see
her
bridegroom
until
he
stood
by
her
side
in
the
great
hall
and
was
married
to
her
and
then
of
course
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
say
she
would
have
him
but
next
morning
the
princess
had
disappeared
the
lay
sleeping
all
alone
and
it
was
quite
plain
that
he
had
eaten
her
a
little
while
after
the
prince
decided
that
he
might
now
go
journeying
again
in
search
of
a
and
off
he
drove
in
the
royal
chariot
with
the
six
white
horses
but
at
the
first
there
lay
the
crying
with
his
great
wide
open
mouth
a
bride
for
me
before
a
bride
for
you
so
the
carriage
tried
another
road
and
the
same
thing
happened
and
they
had
to
turn
back
again
this
time
just
as
formerly
and
the
king
wrote
to
several
foreign
countries
to
know
if
anyone
would
marry
his
son
at
last
another
arrived
this
time
from
a
very
far
distant
land
and
of
course
she
was
not
allowed
to
see
her
future
husband
before
the
wedding
took
place
and
then
lo
and
behold
it
was
the
who
stood
at
her
side
and
next
morning
the
princess
had
disappeared
and
the
lay
sleeping
all
alone
and
it
was
quite
clear
that
he
had
eaten
her
by
and
by
the
started
on
his
quest
for
the
third
time
and
at
the
first
there
lay
the
with
his
great
wide
open
mouth
demanding
a
bride
as
before
and
the
went
straight
back
to
the
castle
and
told
the
you
must
find
another
bride
for
my
elder
brother
i
do
know
where
i
am
to
find
her
said
the
i
have
already
made
enemies
of
two
great
kings
who
sent
their
daughters
here
as
brides
and
i
have
no
notion
how
i
can
obtain
a
third
lady
people
are
beginning
to
say
strange
things
and
i
am
sure
no
will
dare
to
come
now
down
in
a
little
cottage
near
a
wood
there
lived
the
shepherd
an
old
man
with
his
only
daughter
and
the
came
one
day
and
said
to
him
will
you
give
me
your
daughter
to
marry
my
son
the
and
i
will
make
you
rich
for
the
rest
of
your
life
no
sire
said
the
shepherd
that
i
can
not
do
she
is
my
only
child
and
i
want
her
to
take
care
of
me
when
i
am
old
besides
if
the
would
not
spare
two
beautiful
princesses
he
spare
her
either
he
will
just
gobble
her
up
and
she
is
much
too
good
for
such
a
fate
but
the
would
take
no
for
an
answer
and
at
last
the
old
man
had
to
give
in
well
when
the
old
shepherd
told
his
daughter
that
she
was
to
be
bride
she
was
utterly
in
despair
she
went
out
into
the
woods
crying
and
wringing
her
hands
and
bewailing
her
hard
fate
and
while
she
wandered
to
and
fro
an
old
suddenly
appeared
out
of
a
big
hollow
and
asked
her
why
do
you
look
so
doleful
pretty
lass
the
said
it
no
use
my
telling
you
for
nobody
in
the
world
can
help
me
oh
you
never
know
said
the
old
woman
just
you
let
me
hear
what
your
trouble
is
and
maybe
i
can
put
things
right
ah
how
can
you
said
the
girl
for
i
am
to
be
married
to
the
eldest
son
who
is
a
he
has
already
married
two
beautiful
princesses
and
devoured
them
and
he
will
eat
me
too
no
wonder
i
am
distressed
well
you
need
be
said
the
all
that
can
be
set
right
in
a
twinkling
if
only
you
will
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
so
the
girl
said
she
would
listen
then
said
the
old
woman
after
the
marriage
ceremony
is
over
and
when
it
is
time
for
you
to
retire
to
rest
you
must
ask
to
be
dressed
in
ten
shifts
and
you
must
then
ask
for
a
tub
full
of
lye
that
is
washing
water
prepared
with
and
a
tub
full
of
fresh
milk
and
as
many
whips
as
a
boy
can
carry
in
his
arms
and
have
all
these
brought
into
your
then
when
the
tells
you
to
shed
a
shift
do
you
bid
him
slough
a
skin
and
when
all
his
skins
are
off
you
must
dip
the
whips
in
the
lye
and
whip
him
next
you
must
wash
him
in
the
fresh
milk
and
lastly
you
must
take
him
and
hold
him
in
your
arms
if
it
only
for
one
moment
the
last
is
the
worst
notion
ugh
said
the
shepherd
daughter
and
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
holding
the
cold
slimy
scaly
do
just
as
i
have
said
and
all
will
go
well
said
the
old
woman
then
she
disappeared
again
in
the
when
the
arrived
the
girl
was
fetched
in
the
royal
chariot
with
the
six
white
horses
and
taken
to
the
castle
to
be
decked
as
a
bride
and
she
asked
for
ten
shifts
to
be
brought
her
and
the
tub
of
lye
and
the
tub
of
milk
and
as
many
whips
as
a
boy
could
carry
in
his
arms
the
ladies
and
courtiers
in
the
castle
thought
of
course
that
this
was
some
bit
of
peasant
superstition
all
rubbish
and
nonsense
but
the
said
let
her
have
whatever
she
asks
for
she
was
then
arrayed
in
the
most
wonderful
robes
and
looked
the
loveliest
of
brides
she
was
led
to
the
hall
where
the
wedding
ceremony
was
to
take
place
and
she
saw
the
for
the
first
time
as
he
came
in
and
stood
by
her
side
so
they
were
married
and
a
great
was
held
a
banquet
fit
for
the
son
of
a
king
illustration
she
saw
the
lindworm
for
the
first
time
as
he
came
in
and
stood
by
her
side
when
the
feast
was
over
the
bridegroom
and
bride
were
conducted
to
their
apartment
with
music
and
torches
and
a
great
procession
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
the
turned
to
her
and
said
fair
maiden
shed
a
shift
the
shepherd
daughter
answered
him
slough
a
skin
no
one
has
ever
dared
tell
me
to
do
that
before
said
but
i
command
you
to
do
it
now
said
she
then
he
began
to
moan
and
wriggle
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
long
lay
upon
the
floor
beside
him
the
girl
drew
off
her
first
shift
and
spread
it
on
top
of
the
skin
the
said
again
to
her
fair
maiden
shed
a
shift
the
shepherd
daughter
answered
him
slough
a
skin
no
one
has
ever
dared
tell
me
to
do
that
before
said
but
i
command
you
to
do
it
now
said
she
then
with
groans
and
moans
he
cast
off
the
second
skin
and
she
covered
it
with
her
second
shift
the
said
for
the
third
time
fair
maiden
shed
a
shift
the
shepherd
daughter
answered
him
again
slough
a
skin
no
one
has
ever
dared
tell
me
to
do
that
before
said
he
and
his
little
eyes
rolled
furiously
but
the
girl
was
not
afraid
and
once
more
she
commanded
him
to
do
as
she
bade
and
so
this
went
on
until
nine
skins
were
lying
on
the
floor
each
of
them
covered
with
a
shift
and
there
was
nothing
left
of
the
but
a
huge
thick
mass
most
horrible
to
see
then
the
girl
seized
the
whips
dipped
them
in
the
lye
and
whipped
him
as
hard
as
ever
she
could
next
she
bathed
him
all
over
in
the
fresh
milk
lastly
she
dragged
him
on
to
the
bed
and
put
her
arms
round
him
and
she
fell
fast
asleep
that
very
moment
next
morning
very
early
the
and
the
courtiers
came
and
peeped
in
through
the
keyhole
they
wanted
to
know
what
had
become
of
the
girl
but
none
of
them
dared
enter
the
room
however
in
the
end
growing
bolder
they
opened
the
door
a
tiny
bit
and
there
they
saw
the
girl
all
fresh
and
rosy
and
beside
her
lay
no
but
the
handsomest
prince
that
any
one
could
wish
to
see
the
ran
out
and
fetched
the
and
after
that
there
were
such
rejoicings
in
the
castle
as
never
were
known
before
or
since
the
wedding
took
place
all
over
again
much
finer
than
the
first
with
festivals
and
banquets
and
merrymakings
for
days
and
weeks
no
bride
was
ever
so
beloved
by
a
king
and
queen
as
this
peasant
maid
from
the
shepherd
cottage
there
was
no
end
to
their
love
and
their
kindness
towards
her
because
by
her
sense
and
her
calmness
and
her
courage
she
had
saved
their
son
the
lassie
and
her
godmother
once
on
a
time
a
poor
couple
lived
far
far
away
in
a
great
wood
the
wife
was
brought
to
bed
and
had
a
pretty
girl
but
they
were
so
poor
they
did
not
know
how
to
get
the
babe
christened
for
they
had
no
money
to
pay
the
parson
fees
so
one
day
the
father
went
out
to
see
if
he
could
find
any
one
who
was
willing
to
stand
for
the
child
and
pay
the
fees
but
though
he
walked
about
the
whole
day
from
one
house
to
another
and
though
all
said
they
were
willing
enough
to
stand
no
one
thought
himself
bound
to
pay
the
fees
now
when
he
was
going
home
again
a
lovely
lady
met
him
dressed
so
fine
and
she
looked
so
thoroughly
good
and
kind
she
offered
to
get
the
babe
christened
but
after
that
she
said
she
must
keep
it
for
her
own
the
husband
answered
he
must
first
ask
his
wife
what
she
wished
to
do
but
when
he
got
home
and
told
his
story
the
wife
said
right
out
no
next
day
the
man
went
out
again
but
no
one
would
stand
if
they
had
to
pay
the
fees
and
though
he
begged
and
prayed
he
could
get
no
help
and
again
as
he
went
home
towards
evening
the
same
lovely
lady
met
him
who
looked
so
sweet
and
good
and
she
made
him
the
same
offer
so
he
told
his
wife
again
how
he
had
fared
and
this
time
she
said
if
he
could
get
any
one
to
stand
for
his
babe
next
day
they
must
just
let
the
lady
have
her
way
since
she
seemed
so
kind
and
good
the
third
day
the
man
went
about
but
he
could
get
any
one
to
stand
and
so
when
towards
evening
he
met
the
kind
lady
again
he
gave
his
word
she
should
have
the
babe
if
she
would
only
get
it
christened
at
the
font
so
next
morning
she
came
to
the
place
where
the
man
lived
followed
by
two
men
to
stand
godfathers
took
the
babe
and
carried
it
to
church
and
there
it
was
christened
after
that
she
took
it
to
her
own
house
and
there
the
little
girl
lived
with
her
several
years
and
her
was
always
kind
and
friendly
to
her
now
when
the
had
grown
to
be
big
enough
to
know
right
and
wrong
her
got
ready
to
go
on
a
journey
you
have
my
leave
she
said
to
go
all
over
the
house
except
those
rooms
which
i
shew
you
and
when
she
had
said
that
away
she
went
but
the
could
not
forbear
just
to
open
one
of
the
doors
a
little
bit
when
pop
out
flew
a
star
when
her
came
back
she
was
very
vexed
to
find
that
the
star
had
flown
out
and
she
got
very
angry
with
her
and
threatened
to
send
her
away
but
the
child
cried
and
begged
so
hard
that
she
got
leave
to
stay
now
after
a
while
the
had
to
go
on
another
journey
and
before
she
went
she
forbade
the
to
go
into
those
two
rooms
into
which
she
had
never
been
she
promised
to
beware
but
when
she
was
left
alone
she
began
to
think
and
to
wonder
what
there
could
be
in
the
second
room
and
at
last
she
could
not
help
setting
the
door
a
little
ajar
just
to
peep
in
when
pop
out
flew
the
moon
illustration
she
could
not
help
setting
the
door
a
little
ajar
just
to
peep
in
when
pop
out
flew
the
moon
when
her
came
home
and
found
the
moon
let
out
she
was
very
downcast
and
said
to
the
she
must
go
away
she
could
not
stay
with
her
any
longer
but
the
wept
so
bitterly
and
prayed
so
heartily
for
forgiveness
that
this
time
too
she
got
leave
to
stay
some
time
after
the
had
to
go
away
again
and
she
charged
the
lassie
who
by
this
time
was
half
grown
up
most
earnestly
that
she
must
try
to
go
into
or
to
peep
into
the
third
room
but
when
her
had
been
gone
some
time
and
the
was
weary
of
walking
about
alone
all
at
once
she
thought
dear
me
what
fun
it
would
be
just
to
peep
a
little
into
that
third
room
then
she
thought
she
must
do
it
for
her
sake
but
when
the
bad
thought
came
the
second
time
she
could
hold
out
no
longer
come
what
might
she
must
and
would
look
into
the
room
so
she
just
opened
the
door
a
tiny
bit
when
pop
out
flew
the
sun
but
when
her
came
back
and
saw
that
the
sun
had
flown
away
she
was
cut
to
the
heart
and
said
now
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
must
and
should
go
away
she
could
hear
of
her
staying
any
longer
now
the
cried
her
eyes
out
and
begged
and
prayed
so
prettily
but
it
was
all
no
good
nay
but
i
must
punish
you
said
her
but
you
may
have
your
choice
either
to
be
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
world
and
not
to
be
able
to
speak
or
to
keep
your
speech
and
to
be
the
ugliest
of
all
women
but
away
from
me
you
must
go
and
the
said
i
would
sooner
be
lovely
so
she
became
all
at
once
wondrous
fair
but
from
that
day
forth
she
was
dumb
so
when
she
went
away
from
her
she
walked
and
wandered
through
a
great
great
wood
but
the
farther
she
went
the
farther
off
the
end
seemed
to
be
so
when
the
evening
came
on
she
clomb
up
into
a
tall
tree
which
grew
over
a
spring
and
there
she
made
herself
up
to
sleep
that
night
close
by
lay
a
castle
and
from
that
castle
came
early
every
morning
a
maid
to
draw
water
to
make
the
prince
tea
from
the
spring
over
which
the
was
sitting
so
the
maid
looked
down
into
the
spring
saw
the
lovely
face
in
the
water
and
thought
it
was
her
own
then
she
flung
away
the
pitcher
and
ran
home
and
when
she
got
there
she
tossed
up
her
head
and
said
if
i
so
pretty
i
far
too
good
to
go
and
fetch
water
so
another
maid
had
to
go
for
the
water
but
the
same
thing
happened
to
her
she
went
back
and
said
she
was
far
too
pretty
and
too
good
to
fetch
water
from
the
spring
for
the
prince
then
the
prince
went
himself
for
he
had
a
mind
to
see
what
all
this
could
mean
so
when
he
reached
the
spring
he
too
saw
the
image
in
the
water
but
he
looked
up
at
once
and
became
aware
of
the
lovely
who
sate
there
up
in
the
tree
then
he
coaxed
her
down
and
took
her
home
and
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
have
her
for
his
queen
because
she
was
so
lovely
but
his
mother
who
was
still
alive
was
against
it
illustration
then
he
coaxed
her
down
and
took
her
home
she
ca
speak
she
said
and
maybe
she
a
wicked
witch
but
the
prince
could
not
be
content
till
he
got
her
so
after
they
had
lived
together
a
while
the
was
to
have
a
child
and
when
the
child
came
to
be
born
the
prince
set
a
strong
watch
about
her
but
at
the
birth
one
and
all
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
her
came
cut
the
babe
on
its
little
finger
and
smeared
the
queen
mouth
with
the
blood
and
said
now
you
shall
be
as
grieved
as
i
was
when
you
let
out
the
star
and
with
these
words
she
carried
off
the
babe
but
when
those
who
were
on
the
watch
woke
they
thought
the
queen
had
eaten
her
own
child
and
the
old
queen
was
all
for
burning
her
alive
but
the
prince
was
so
fond
of
her
that
at
last
he
begged
her
off
but
he
had
hard
work
to
set
her
free
so
the
next
time
the
young
queen
was
to
have
a
child
twice
as
strong
a
watch
was
set
as
the
first
time
but
the
same
thing
happened
over
again
only
this
time
her
said
now
you
shall
be
as
grieved
as
i
was
when
you
let
the
moon
out
and
the
queen
begged
and
prayed
and
wept
for
when
her
was
there
she
could
speak
but
it
was
all
no
good
and
now
the
old
queen
said
she
must
be
burnt
but
the
prince
found
means
to
beg
her
off
but
when
the
third
child
was
to
be
born
a
watch
was
set
three
times
as
strong
as
the
first
but
just
the
same
thing
happened
her
came
while
the
watch
slept
took
the
babe
and
cut
its
little
finger
and
smeared
the
queen
mouth
with
the
blood
telling
her
now
she
should
be
as
grieved
as
she
had
been
when
the
let
out
the
sun
and
now
the
prince
could
not
save
her
any
longer
she
must
and
should
be
burnt
but
just
as
they
were
leading
her
to
the
stake
all
at
once
they
saw
her
who
came
with
all
three
children
two
she
led
by
the
hand
and
the
third
she
had
on
her
arm
and
so
she
went
up
to
the
young
queen
and
said
illustration
here
are
your
children
now
you
shall
have
them
again
i
am
the
virgin
mary
here
are
your
children
now
you
shall
have
them
again
i
am
the
virgin
mary
and
so
grieved
as
you
have
been
so
grieved
was
i
when
you
let
out
sun
and
moon
and
star
now
you
have
been
punished
for
what
you
did
and
henceforth
you
shall
have
your
speech
how
glad
the
queen
and
prince
now
were
all
may
easily
think
but
no
one
can
tell
after
that
they
were
always
happy
and
from
that
day
even
the
prince
mother
was
very
fond
of
the
young
queen
the
husband
who
was
to
mind
the
house
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
man
so
surly
and
cross
he
never
thought
his
did
anything
right
in
the
house
so
one
evening
in
haymaking
time
he
came
home
scolding
and
swearing
and
showing
his
teeth
and
making
a
dust
dear
love
do
be
so
angry
there
a
good
man
said
his
goody
let
change
our
work
i
go
out
with
the
mowers
and
mow
and
you
shall
mind
the
house
at
home
yes
the
thought
that
would
do
very
well
he
was
quite
willing
he
said
so
early
next
morning
his
goody
took
a
scythe
over
her
neck
and
went
out
into
the
hayfield
with
the
mowers
and
began
to
mow
but
the
man
was
to
mind
the
house
and
do
the
work
at
home
first
of
all
he
wanted
to
churn
the
butter
but
when
he
had
churned
a
while
he
got
thirsty
and
went
down
to
the
cellar
to
tap
a
barrel
of
ale
so
just
when
he
had
knocked
in
the
bung
and
was
putting
the
tap
into
the
cask
he
heard
overhead
the
pig
come
into
the
kitchen
then
off
he
ran
up
the
cellar
steps
with
the
tap
in
his
hand
as
fast
as
he
could
to
look
after
the
pig
lest
it
should
upset
the
churn
but
when
he
got
up
and
saw
the
pig
had
already
knocked
the
churn
over
and
stood
there
routing
and
grunting
amongst
the
cream
which
was
running
all
over
the
floor
he
got
so
wild
with
rage
that
he
quite
forgot
the
and
ran
at
the
pig
as
hard
as
he
could
he
caught
it
too
just
as
it
ran
out
of
doors
and
gave
it
such
a
kick
that
piggy
lay
for
dead
on
the
spot
then
all
at
once
he
remembered
he
had
the
tap
in
his
hand
but
when
he
got
down
to
the
cellar
every
drop
of
ale
had
run
out
of
the
cask
then
he
went
into
the
dairy
and
found
enough
cream
left
to
fill
the
churn
again
and
so
he
began
to
churn
for
butter
they
must
have
at
dinner
when
he
had
churned
a
bit
he
remembered
that
their
milking
cow
was
still
shut
up
in
the
byre
and
had
had
a
bit
to
eat
or
a
drop
to
drink
all
the
morning
though
the
sun
was
high
then
all
at
once
he
thought
was
too
far
to
take
her
down
to
the
meadow
so
just
get
her
up
on
the
house
top
for
the
house
you
must
know
was
thatched
with
sods
and
a
fine
crop
of
grass
was
growing
there
now
the
house
lay
close
up
against
a
steep
down
and
he
thought
if
he
laid
a
plank
across
to
the
thatch
at
the
back
he
easily
get
the
cow
up
but
still
he
could
leave
the
churn
for
there
was
his
little
babe
crawling
about
on
the
floor
and
if
i
leave
it
he
thought
the
child
is
safe
to
upset
it
so
he
took
the
churn
on
his
back
and
went
out
with
it
but
then
he
thought
he
better
first
water
the
cow
before
he
turned
her
out
on
the
thatch
so
he
took
up
a
bucket
to
draw
water
out
of
the
well
but
as
he
stooped
down
at
the
well
brink
all
the
cream
ran
out
of
the
churn
over
his
shoulders
and
so
down
into
the
well
now
it
was
near
and
he
had
even
got
the
butter
yet
so
he
thought
he
best
boil
the
porridge
and
filled
the
pot
with
water
and
hung
it
over
the
fire
when
he
had
done
that
he
thought
the
cow
might
perhaps
fall
off
the
thatch
and
break
her
legs
or
her
neck
so
he
got
up
on
the
house
to
tie
her
up
one
end
of
the
rope
he
made
fast
to
the
cow
neck
and
the
other
he
slipped
down
the
chimney
and
tied
round
his
own
thigh
and
he
had
to
make
haste
for
the
water
now
began
to
boil
in
the
pot
and
he
had
still
to
grind
the
oatmeal
so
he
began
to
grind
away
but
while
he
was
hard
at
it
down
fell
the
cow
off
the
after
all
and
as
she
fell
she
dragged
the
man
up
the
chimney
by
the
rope
there
he
stuck
fast
and
as
for
the
cow
she
hung
down
the
wall
swinging
between
heaven
and
earth
for
she
could
neither
get
down
nor
up
and
now
the
goody
had
waited
seven
lengths
and
seven
breadths
for
her
to
come
and
call
them
home
to
dinner
but
never
a
call
they
had
at
last
she
thought
she
waited
long
enough
and
went
home
but
when
she
got
there
and
saw
the
cow
hanging
in
such
an
ugly
place
she
ran
up
and
cut
the
rope
in
two
with
her
scythe
but
as
she
did
this
down
came
her
out
of
the
chimney
and
so
when
his
old
dame
came
inside
the
kitchen
there
she
found
him
standing
on
his
head
in
the
porridge
pot
the
lad
who
went
to
the
north
wind
once
on
a
time
there
was
an
old
widow
who
had
one
son
and
as
she
was
poorly
and
weak
her
son
had
to
go
up
into
the
safe
to
fetch
meal
for
cooking
but
when
he
got
outside
the
safe
and
was
just
going
down
the
steps
there
came
the
puffing
and
blowing
caught
up
the
meal
and
so
away
with
it
through
the
air
then
the
went
back
into
the
safe
for
more
but
when
he
came
out
again
on
the
steps
if
the
did
come
again
and
carry
off
the
meal
with
a
puff
and
more
than
that
he
did
so
the
third
time
at
this
the
got
very
angry
and
as
he
thought
it
hard
that
the
should
behave
so
he
thought
he
just
look
him
up
and
ask
him
to
give
up
his
meal
so
off
he
went
but
the
way
was
long
and
he
walked
and
walked
but
at
last
he
came
to
the
house
good
day
said
the
and
thank
you
for
coming
to
see
us
yesterday
good
day
answered
the
for
his
voice
was
loud
and
gruff
and
thanks
for
coming
to
see
me
what
do
you
want
oh
answered
the
i
only
wished
to
ask
you
to
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
have
back
that
meal
you
took
from
me
on
the
safe
steps
for
we
have
much
to
live
on
and
if
you
to
go
on
snapping
up
the
morsel
we
have
there
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
starve
i
have
got
your
meal
said
the
but
if
you
are
in
such
need
i
give
you
a
cloth
which
will
get
you
everything
you
want
if
you
only
say
spread
yourself
and
serve
up
all
kinds
of
good
dishes
with
this
the
was
well
content
but
as
the
way
was
so
long
he
could
get
home
in
one
day
so
he
turned
into
an
inn
on
the
way
and
when
they
were
going
to
sit
down
to
supper
he
laid
the
cloth
on
a
table
which
stood
in
the
corner
and
said
cloth
spread
yourself
and
serve
up
all
kinds
of
good
dishes
he
had
scarce
said
so
before
the
cloth
did
as
it
was
bid
and
all
who
stood
by
thought
it
a
fine
thing
but
most
of
all
the
landlady
so
when
all
were
fast
asleep
at
dead
of
night
she
took
the
cloth
and
put
another
in
its
stead
just
like
the
one
he
had
got
from
the
but
which
could
so
much
as
serve
up
a
bit
of
dry
bread
so
when
the
woke
he
took
his
cloth
and
went
off
with
it
and
that
day
he
got
home
to
his
mother
now
said
he
i
been
to
the
house
and
a
good
fellow
he
is
for
he
gave
me
this
cloth
and
when
i
only
say
to
it
spread
yourself
and
serve
up
all
kinds
of
good
dishes
i
get
any
sort
of
food
i
please
all
very
true
i
daresay
said
his
mother
but
seeing
is
believing
and
i
sha
believe
it
till
i
see
it
so
the
made
haste
drew
out
a
table
laid
the
cloth
on
it
and
said
cloth
spread
yourself
and
serve
up
all
kinds
of
good
dishes
but
never
a
bit
of
dry
bread
did
the
cloth
serve
up
well
said
the
there
no
help
for
it
but
to
go
to
the
again
and
away
he
went
so
he
came
to
where
the
lived
late
in
the
afternoon
good
evening
said
the
good
evening
said
the
i
want
my
rights
for
that
meal
of
ours
which
you
took
said
the
for
as
for
that
cloth
i
got
it
is
worth
a
penny
i
got
no
meal
said
the
but
yonder
you
have
a
ram
which
coins
nothing
but
golden
ducats
as
soon
as
you
say
to
it
ram
make
money
so
the
thought
this
a
fine
thing
but
as
it
was
too
far
to
get
home
that
day
he
turned
in
for
the
night
to
the
same
inn
where
he
had
slept
before
before
he
called
for
anything
he
tried
the
truth
of
what
the
had
said
of
the
ram
and
found
it
all
right
but
when
the
landlord
saw
that
he
thought
it
was
a
famous
ram
and
when
the
had
fallen
asleep
he
took
another
which
could
coin
gold
ducats
and
changed
the
two
next
morning
off
went
the
and
when
he
got
home
to
his
mother
he
said
after
all
the
is
a
jolly
fellow
for
now
he
has
given
me
a
ram
which
can
coin
golden
ducats
if
i
only
say
ram
make
money
all
very
true
i
daresay
said
his
mother
but
i
sha
believe
any
such
stuff
until
i
see
the
ducats
made
ram
ram
make
money
said
the
but
if
the
ram
made
anything
it
was
money
so
the
went
back
again
to
the
and
blew
him
up
and
said
the
ram
was
worth
nothing
and
he
must
have
his
rights
for
the
meal
well
said
the
i
nothing
else
to
give
you
but
that
old
stick
in
the
corner
yonder
but
its
a
stick
of
that
kind
that
if
you
say
stick
lay
on
it
lays
on
till
you
say
stick
now
stop
so
as
the
way
was
long
the
turned
in
this
night
too
to
the
landlord
but
as
he
could
pretty
well
guess
how
things
stood
as
to
the
cloth
and
the
ram
he
lay
down
at
once
on
the
bench
and
began
to
snore
as
if
he
were
asleep
now
the
landlord
who
easily
saw
that
the
stick
must
be
worth
something
hunted
up
one
which
was
like
it
and
when
he
heard
the
lad
snore
was
going
to
change
the
two
but
just
as
the
landlord
was
about
to
take
it
the
bawled
out
stick
stick
lay
on
so
the
stick
began
to
beat
the
landlord
till
he
jumped
over
chairs
and
tables
and
benches
and
yelled
and
roared
oh
my
oh
my
bid
the
stick
be
still
else
it
will
beat
me
to
death
and
you
shall
have
back
both
your
cloth
and
your
ram
when
the
thought
the
landlord
had
got
enough
he
said
stick
stick
now
stop
then
he
took
the
cloth
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
and
went
home
with
his
stick
in
his
hand
leading
the
ram
by
a
cord
round
its
horns
and
so
he
got
his
rights
for
the
meal
he
had
lost
the
three
princesses
of
whiteland
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
fisherman
who
lived
close
by
a
palace
and
fished
for
the
table
one
day
when
he
was
out
fishing
he
just
caught
nothing
do
what
he
would
however
he
tried
with
bait
and
angle
there
was
never
a
sprat
on
his
hook
but
when
the
day
was
far
spent
a
head
bobbed
up
out
of
the
water
and
said
if
i
may
have
what
your
wife
bears
under
her
girdle
you
shall
catch
fish
enough
so
the
man
answered
boldly
yes
for
he
did
not
know
that
his
wife
was
going
to
have
a
child
after
that
as
was
like
enough
he
caught
plenty
of
fish
of
all
kinds
but
when
he
got
home
at
night
and
told
his
story
how
he
had
got
all
that
fish
his
wife
fell
and
moaning
and
was
beside
herself
for
the
promise
which
her
husband
had
made
for
she
said
i
bear
a
babe
under
my
girdle
well
the
story
soon
spread
and
came
up
to
the
castle
and
when
the
heard
the
woman
grief
and
its
cause
he
sent
down
to
say
he
would
take
care
of
the
child
and
see
if
he
could
save
it
so
the
months
went
on
and
on
and
when
her
time
came
the
fisher
wife
had
a
boy
so
the
king
took
it
at
once
and
brought
it
up
as
his
own
son
until
the
lad
grew
up
then
he
begged
leave
one
day
to
go
out
fishing
with
his
father
he
had
such
a
mind
to
go
he
said
at
first
the
would
hear
of
it
but
at
last
the
lad
had
his
way
and
went
so
he
and
his
father
were
out
the
whole
day
and
all
went
right
and
well
till
they
landed
at
night
then
the
lad
remembered
he
had
left
his
handkerchief
and
went
to
look
for
it
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
got
into
the
boat
it
began
to
move
off
with
him
at
such
speed
that
the
water
roared
under
the
bow
and
all
the
lad
could
do
in
rowing
against
it
with
the
oars
was
no
use
so
he
went
and
went
the
whole
night
and
at
last
he
came
to
a
white
strand
far
far
away
there
he
went
ashore
and
when
he
had
walked
about
a
bit
an
old
old
man
met
him
with
a
long
white
beard
what
the
name
of
this
land
asked
the
lad
whiteland
said
the
man
who
went
on
to
ask
the
lad
whence
he
came
and
what
he
was
going
to
do
so
the
lad
told
him
all
illustration
you
come
to
three
princesses
whom
you
will
see
standing
in
the
earth
up
to
their
necks
with
only
their
heads
out
aye
aye
said
the
man
now
when
you
have
walked
a
little
farther
along
the
strand
here
you
come
to
three
whom
you
will
see
standing
in
the
earth
up
to
their
necks
with
only
their
heads
out
then
the
first
she
is
the
eldest
will
call
out
and
beg
you
so
prettily
to
come
and
help
her
and
the
second
will
do
the
same
to
neither
of
these
shall
you
go
make
haste
past
them
as
if
you
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
but
the
third
you
shall
go
to
and
do
what
she
asks
if
you
do
this
you
have
good
luck
that
all
when
the
lad
came
to
the
first
she
called
out
to
him
and
begged
him
so
prettily
to
come
to
her
but
he
passed
on
as
though
he
saw
her
not
in
the
same
way
he
passed
by
the
second
but
to
the
third
he
went
straight
up
if
you
do
what
i
bid
you
she
said
you
may
have
which
of
us
you
please
yes
he
was
willing
enough
so
she
told
him
how
three
had
set
them
down
in
the
earth
there
but
before
they
had
lived
in
the
castle
up
among
the
trees
now
she
said
you
must
go
into
that
castle
and
let
the
whip
you
each
one
night
for
each
of
us
if
you
can
bear
that
set
us
free
well
the
lad
said
he
was
ready
to
try
when
you
go
in
the
went
on
to
say
you
see
two
lions
standing
at
the
gate
but
if
you
only
go
right
in
the
middle
between
them
they
do
you
no
harm
then
go
straight
on
into
a
little
dark
room
and
make
your
bed
then
the
will
come
to
whip
you
but
if
you
take
the
flask
which
hangs
on
the
wall
and
rub
yourself
with
the
ointment
that
in
it
wherever
his
lash
falls
you
be
as
sound
as
ever
then
grasp
the
sword
that
hangs
by
the
side
of
the
flask
and
strike
the
dead
yes
he
did
as
the
told
him
he
passed
in
the
midst
between
the
lions
as
if
he
had
seen
them
and
went
straight
into
the
little
room
and
there
he
lay
down
to
sleep
the
first
night
there
came
a
with
three
heads
and
three
rods
and
whipped
the
lad
soundly
but
he
stood
it
till
the
was
done
then
he
took
the
flask
and
rubbed
himself
and
grasped
the
sword
and
slew
the
so
when
he
went
out
next
morning
the
stood
out
of
the
earth
up
to
their
waists
the
next
night
was
the
same
story
over
again
only
this
time
the
had
six
heads
and
six
rods
and
he
whipped
him
far
worse
than
the
first
but
when
he
went
out
next
morning
the
stood
out
of
the
earth
as
far
as
the
knee
the
third
night
there
came
a
that
had
nine
heads
and
nine
rods
and
he
whipped
and
flogged
the
lad
so
long
that
he
fainted
away
then
the
took
him
up
and
dashed
him
against
the
wall
but
the
shock
brought
down
the
flask
which
fell
on
the
lad
burst
and
spilled
the
ointment
all
over
him
and
so
he
became
as
strong
and
sound
as
ever
again
then
he
was
slow
he
grasped
the
sword
and
slew
the
and
next
morning
when
he
went
out
of
the
castle
the
stood
before
him
with
all
their
bodies
out
of
the
earth
so
he
took
the
youngest
for
his
and
lived
well
and
happily
with
her
for
some
time
at
last
he
began
to
long
to
go
home
for
a
little
to
see
his
parents
his
did
not
like
this
but
at
last
his
heart
was
so
set
on
it
and
he
longed
and
longed
so
much
there
was
no
holding
him
back
so
she
said
one
thing
you
must
promise
me
this
only
to
do
what
your
father
begs
you
to
do
and
not
what
mother
wishes
and
that
he
promised
then
she
gave
him
a
ring
which
was
of
that
kind
that
any
one
who
wore
it
might
wish
two
wishes
so
he
wished
himself
home
and
when
he
got
home
his
parents
could
not
wonder
enough
what
a
grand
man
their
son
had
become
now
when
he
had
been
at
home
some
days
his
mother
wished
him
to
go
up
to
the
palace
and
show
the
what
a
fine
fellow
he
had
come
to
be
but
his
father
said
no
do
let
him
do
that
if
he
does
we
sha
have
any
more
joy
of
him
this
time
but
it
was
no
good
the
mother
begged
and
prayed
so
long
that
at
last
he
went
so
when
he
got
up
to
the
palace
he
was
far
braver
both
in
clothes
and
array
than
the
other
king
who
did
quite
like
this
and
at
last
he
said
all
very
fine
but
here
you
can
see
my
what
like
she
is
but
i
ca
see
yours
that
i
ca
do
you
know
i
scarce
think
she
so
as
mine
would
to
heaven
said
the
young
she
were
standing
here
then
you
see
what
she
was
like
and
that
instant
there
she
stood
before
them
but
she
was
very
woeful
and
said
to
him
why
did
you
not
mind
what
i
told
you
and
why
did
you
not
listen
to
what
your
father
said
now
i
must
away
home
and
as
for
you
you
have
had
both
your
wishes
with
that
she
knitted
a
ring
among
his
hair
with
her
name
on
it
and
wished
herself
home
and
was
off
then
the
young
was
cut
to
the
heart
and
went
day
out
day
in
thinking
and
thinking
how
he
should
get
back
to
his
just
try
he
thought
if
i
ca
learn
where
whiteland
lies
and
so
he
went
out
into
the
world
to
ask
so
when
he
had
gone
a
good
way
he
came
to
a
high
hill
and
there
he
met
one
who
was
lord
over
all
the
beasts
of
the
wood
for
they
all
came
home
to
him
when
he
blew
his
horn
so
the
asked
if
he
knew
where
whiteland
was
no
i
do
said
he
but
i
ask
my
beasts
then
he
blew
his
horn
and
called
them
and
asked
if
any
of
them
knew
where
whiteland
lay
but
there
was
no
beast
that
knew
so
the
man
gave
him
a
pair
of
illustration
so
the
man
gave
him
a
pair
of
when
you
get
on
these
he
said
you
come
to
my
brother
who
lives
hundreds
of
miles
off
he
is
lord
over
all
the
birds
of
the
air
ask
him
when
you
reach
his
house
just
turn
the
shoes
so
that
the
toes
point
this
way
and
they
come
home
of
themselves
so
when
the
reached
the
house
he
turned
the
shoes
as
the
lord
of
the
beasts
had
said
and
away
they
went
home
of
themselves
so
he
asked
again
after
whiteland
and
the
man
called
all
the
birds
with
a
blast
of
his
horn
and
asked
if
any
of
them
knew
where
whiteland
lay
but
none
of
the
birds
knew
now
long
long
after
the
rest
of
the
birds
came
an
old
eagle
which
had
been
away
ten
round
years
but
he
could
tell
any
more
than
the
rest
well
well
said
the
man
i
lend
you
a
pair
of
and
when
you
get
them
on
they
carry
you
to
my
brother
who
lives
hundreds
of
miles
off
he
lord
of
all
the
fish
in
the
sea
better
ask
him
but
do
forget
to
turn
the
toes
of
the
shoes
this
way
the
was
full
of
thanks
got
on
the
shoes
and
when
he
came
to
the
man
who
was
lord
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
he
turned
the
toes
round
and
so
off
they
went
home
like
the
other
pair
after
that
he
asked
again
after
whiteland
so
the
man
called
the
fish
with
a
blast
but
no
fish
could
tell
where
it
lay
at
last
came
an
old
pike
which
they
had
great
work
to
call
home
he
was
such
a
way
off
so
when
they
asked
him
he
said
know
it
i
should
think
i
did
i
been
cook
there
ten
years
and
i
going
there
again
for
now
the
queen
of
whiteland
whose
king
is
away
is
going
to
wed
another
husband
well
said
the
man
as
this
is
so
i
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
hereabouts
on
a
moor
stand
three
brothers
and
here
they
have
stood
these
hundred
years
fighting
about
a
hat
a
cloak
and
a
pair
of
boots
if
any
one
has
these
three
things
he
can
make
himself
invisible
and
wish
himself
anywhere
he
pleases
you
can
tell
them
you
wish
to
try
the
things
and
after
that
you
pass
judgment
between
them
whose
they
shall
be
yes
the
thanked
the
man
and
went
and
did
as
he
told
him
what
all
this
he
said
to
the
brothers
why
do
you
stand
here
fighting
for
ever
and
a
day
just
let
me
try
these
things
and
give
judgment
whose
they
shall
be
they
were
very
willing
to
do
this
but
as
soon
as
he
had
got
the
hat
cloak
and
boots
he
said
when
we
meet
next
time
i
tell
you
my
judgment
and
with
these
words
he
wished
himself
away
so
as
he
went
along
up
in
the
air
he
came
up
with
the
north
wind
whither
away
roared
the
north
wind
to
whiteland
said
the
and
then
he
told
him
all
that
had
befallen
him
ah
said
the
north
wind
you
go
faster
than
i
you
do
for
you
can
go
straight
while
i
have
to
puff
and
blow
round
every
turn
and
corner
but
when
you
get
there
just
place
yourself
on
the
stairs
by
the
side
of
the
door
and
then
i
come
storming
in
as
though
i
were
going
to
blow
down
the
whole
castle
and
then
when
the
prince
who
is
to
have
your
comes
out
to
see
what
the
matter
just
you
take
him
by
the
collar
and
pitch
him
out
of
doors
then
i
look
after
him
and
see
if
i
ca
carry
him
off
illustration
the
king
went
into
the
castle
and
at
first
his
queen
did
know
him
he
was
so
wan
and
thin
through
wandering
so
far
and
being
so
woeful
well
the
did
as
the
north
wind
said
he
took
his
stand
on
the
stairs
and
when
the
north
wind
came
storming
and
roaring
and
took
hold
of
the
castle
wall
so
that
it
shook
again
the
prince
came
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
came
the
caught
him
by
the
collar
and
pitched
him
out
of
doors
and
then
the
north
wind
caught
him
up
and
carried
him
off
so
when
there
was
an
end
of
him
the
went
into
the
castle
and
at
first
his
did
know
him
he
was
so
wan
and
thin
through
wandering
so
far
and
being
so
woeful
but
when
he
shewed
her
the
ring
she
was
as
glad
as
glad
could
be
and
so
the
rightful
wedding
was
held
and
the
fame
of
it
spread
far
and
wide
soria
moria
castle
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
poor
couple
who
had
a
son
whose
name
was
ever
since
he
was
a
little
boy
he
would
turn
his
hand
to
nothing
but
just
sat
there
and
groped
about
in
the
ashes
his
father
and
mother
often
put
him
out
to
learn
this
trade
or
that
but
could
stay
nowhere
for
when
he
had
been
there
a
day
or
two
he
ran
away
from
his
master
and
never
stopped
till
he
was
sitting
again
in
the
ingle
poking
about
in
the
cinders
well
one
day
a
skipper
came
and
asked
if
he
had
a
mind
to
be
with
him
and
go
to
sea
and
see
strange
lands
yes
would
like
that
very
much
so
he
was
long
in
getting
himself
ready
how
long
they
sailed
i
sure
i
ca
tell
but
the
end
of
it
was
they
fell
into
a
great
storm
and
when
it
was
blown
over
and
it
got
still
again
they
could
tell
where
they
were
for
they
had
been
driven
away
to
a
strange
coast
which
none
of
them
knew
anything
about
well
as
there
was
just
no
wind
at
all
they
stayed
lying
there
and
asked
the
skipper
leave
to
go
on
shore
and
look
about
him
he
would
sooner
go
he
said
than
lie
there
and
sleep
do
you
think
now
you
fit
to
show
yourself
before
folk
said
the
skipper
why
you
no
clothes
but
those
rags
you
stand
in
but
stuck
to
his
own
and
so
at
last
he
got
leave
but
he
was
to
be
sure
and
come
back
as
soon
as
ever
it
began
to
blow
so
off
he
went
and
found
a
lovely
land
wherever
he
came
there
were
fine
large
flat
cornfields
and
rich
meads
but
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
living
soul
well
it
began
to
blow
but
thought
he
seen
enough
yet
and
he
wanted
to
walk
a
little
farther
just
to
see
if
he
could
meet
any
folk
so
after
a
while
he
came
to
a
broad
high
road
so
smooth
and
even
you
might
easily
roll
an
egg
along
it
followed
this
and
when
evening
drew
on
he
saw
a
great
castle
ever
so
far
off
from
which
the
sunbeams
shone
so
as
he
had
now
walked
the
whole
day
and
had
taken
a
bit
to
eat
with
him
he
was
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
but
still
the
nearer
he
came
to
the
castle
the
more
afraid
he
got
in
the
castle
kitchen
a
great
fire
was
blazing
and
went
into
it
but
such
a
kitchen
he
had
never
seen
in
all
his
born
days
it
was
so
grand
and
fine
there
were
vessels
of
silver
and
vessels
of
gold
but
still
never
a
living
soul
so
when
had
stood
there
a
while
and
no
one
came
out
he
went
and
opened
a
door
and
there
inside
sat
a
who
span
upon
a
nay
nay
now
she
called
out
dare
christian
folk
come
hither
but
now
you
best
be
off
about
your
business
if
you
do
want
the
to
gobble
you
up
for
here
lives
a
with
three
heads
all
one
to
me
said
the
lad
i
be
just
as
glad
to
hear
he
had
four
heads
beside
i
like
to
see
what
kind
of
fellow
he
is
as
for
going
i
wo
go
at
all
i
done
no
harm
but
meat
you
must
get
me
for
i
almost
starved
to
death
when
had
eaten
his
fill
the
told
him
to
try
if
he
could
brandish
the
sword
that
hung
against
the
wall
no
he
brandish
it
he
could
even
lift
it
up
oh
said
the
now
you
must
go
and
take
a
pull
of
that
flask
that
hangs
by
its
side
that
what
the
does
every
time
he
goes
out
to
use
the
sword
so
took
a
pull
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
could
brandish
the
sword
like
nothing
and
now
he
thought
it
high
time
the
came
and
lo
just
then
up
came
the
puffing
and
blowing
jumped
behind
the
door
hutetu
said
the
as
he
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
what
a
smell
of
christian
man
blood
aye
said
you
soon
know
that
to
your
cost
and
with
that
he
hewed
off
all
his
heads
now
the
was
so
glad
that
she
was
free
she
both
danced
and
sang
but
then
all
at
once
she
called
her
sisters
to
mind
and
so
she
said
would
my
sisters
were
free
too
where
are
they
asked
well
she
told
him
all
about
it
one
was
taken
away
by
a
to
his
castle
which
lay
fifty
miles
off
and
the
other
by
another
to
his
castle
which
was
fifty
miles
further
still
but
now
she
said
you
must
first
help
me
to
get
this
ugly
carcass
out
of
the
house
yes
was
so
strong
he
swept
everything
away
and
made
it
all
clean
and
tidy
in
no
time
so
they
had
a
good
and
happy
time
of
it
and
next
morning
he
set
off
at
peep
of
grey
dawn
he
could
take
no
rest
by
the
way
but
ran
and
walked
the
whole
day
when
he
first
saw
the
castle
he
got
a
little
afraid
it
was
far
grander
than
the
first
but
here
too
there
was
a
living
soul
to
be
seen
so
went
into
the
kitchen
and
did
stop
there
either
but
went
straight
further
on
into
the
house
nay
nay
called
out
the
dare
christian
folk
come
hither
i
do
know
i
sure
how
long
it
is
since
i
came
here
but
in
all
that
time
i
have
seen
a
christian
man
best
you
saw
how
to
get
away
as
fast
as
you
came
for
here
lives
a
who
has
six
heads
i
sha
go
said
if
he
has
six
heads
besides
he
take
you
up
and
swallow
you
down
alive
said
the
but
it
was
no
good
would
go
he
was
at
all
afraid
of
the
but
meat
and
drink
he
must
have
for
he
was
half
starved
after
his
long
journey
well
he
got
as
much
of
that
as
he
wished
but
then
the
wanted
him
to
be
off
again
no
said
i
wo
go
i
done
no
harm
and
i
nothing
to
be
afraid
about
he
wo
stay
to
ask
that
said
the
for
he
take
you
without
law
or
leave
but
as
you
wo
go
just
try
if
you
can
brandish
that
sword
yonder
which
the
wields
in
war
he
could
brandish
it
and
then
the
said
he
must
take
a
pull
at
the
flask
which
hung
by
its
side
and
when
he
had
done
that
he
could
brandish
it
just
then
back
came
the
and
he
was
both
stout
and
big
so
that
he
had
to
go
sideways
to
get
through
the
door
when
the
got
his
first
head
in
he
called
out
hutetu
what
a
smell
of
christian
man
blood
but
that
very
moment
hewed
off
his
first
head
and
so
on
all
the
rest
as
they
popped
in
the
was
overjoyed
but
just
then
she
came
to
think
of
her
sisters
and
wished
out
loud
they
were
free
thought
that
might
easily
be
done
and
wanted
to
be
off
at
once
but
first
he
had
to
help
the
to
get
the
carcass
out
of
the
way
and
so
he
could
only
set
out
next
morning
it
was
a
long
way
to
the
castle
and
he
had
to
walk
fast
and
run
hard
to
reach
it
in
time
but
about
nightfall
he
saw
the
castle
which
was
far
finer
and
grander
than
either
of
the
others
this
time
he
the
least
afraid
but
walked
straight
through
the
kitchen
and
into
the
castle
there
sat
a
who
was
so
pretty
there
was
no
end
to
her
loveliness
she
too
like
the
others
told
him
there
had
been
christian
folk
there
ever
since
she
came
thither
and
bade
him
go
away
again
else
the
would
swallow
him
alive
and
do
you
know
she
said
he
has
nine
heads
aye
aye
said
if
he
had
nine
other
heads
and
nine
other
heads
still
i
wo
go
away
and
so
he
stood
fast
before
the
stove
the
kept
on
begging
him
so
prettily
to
go
away
lest
the
should
gobble
him
up
but
said
let
him
come
as
soon
as
he
likes
so
she
gave
him
the
sword
and
bade
him
take
a
pull
at
the
flask
that
he
might
be
able
to
brandish
and
wield
it
just
then
back
came
the
puffing
and
blowing
and
tearing
along
he
was
far
bigger
and
stouter
than
the
other
two
and
he
too
had
to
go
on
one
side
to
get
through
the
door
so
when
he
got
his
first
head
in
he
said
as
the
others
had
said
hutetu
what
a
smell
of
christian
man
blood
that
very
moment
hewed
off
the
first
head
and
then
all
the
rest
but
the
last
was
the
toughest
of
them
all
and
it
was
the
hardest
bit
of
work
had
to
do
to
get
it
hewn
off
although
he
knew
very
well
he
had
strength
enough
to
do
it
so
all
the
came
together
to
that
castle
which
was
called
moria
and
they
were
glad
and
happy
as
they
had
never
been
in
all
their
lives
before
and
they
all
were
fond
of
and
of
them
and
he
might
choose
the
one
he
liked
best
for
his
bride
but
the
youngest
was
fondest
of
him
of
all
the
three
but
there
after
a
while
went
about
and
was
so
strange
and
dull
and
silent
then
the
princesses
asked
him
what
he
lacked
and
if
he
did
like
to
live
with
them
any
longer
yes
he
did
for
they
had
enough
and
to
spare
and
he
was
well
off
in
every
way
but
still
somehow
or
other
he
did
so
long
to
go
home
for
his
father
and
mother
were
alive
and
them
he
had
such
a
great
wish
to
see
well
they
thought
that
might
be
done
easily
enough
you
shall
go
thither
and
come
back
hither
safe
and
unscathed
if
you
will
only
follow
our
advice
said
the
yes
he
be
sure
to
mind
all
they
said
so
they
dressed
him
up
till
he
was
as
grand
as
a
king
son
and
then
they
set
a
ring
on
his
finger
and
that
was
such
a
ring
he
could
wish
himself
thither
and
hither
with
it
but
they
told
him
to
be
sure
and
not
take
it
off
and
not
to
name
their
names
for
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
his
bravery
and
then
he
never
see
them
more
if
i
only
stood
at
home
i
be
glad
said
and
it
was
done
as
he
had
wished
then
stood
at
his
father
cottage
door
before
he
knew
a
word
about
it
now
it
was
about
dusk
at
even
and
so
when
they
saw
such
a
grand
stately
lord
walk
in
the
old
couple
got
so
afraid
they
began
to
bow
and
scrape
then
asked
if
he
could
stay
there
and
have
a
lodging
there
that
night
no
that
he
could
we
ca
do
it
at
all
they
said
for
we
have
this
thing
or
that
thing
which
such
a
lord
is
used
to
have
best
your
lordship
went
up
to
the
farm
no
long
way
off
for
you
can
see
the
chimneys
and
there
they
have
lots
of
everything
would
hear
of
it
he
wanted
to
stop
but
the
old
couple
stuck
to
their
own
that
he
had
better
go
to
the
farmer
there
he
would
get
both
meat
and
drink
as
for
them
they
had
even
a
chair
to
offer
him
to
sit
down
on
no
said
i
wo
go
up
there
till
early
but
let
me
just
stay
here
worst
come
to
the
worst
i
can
sit
in
the
chimney
corner
well
they
could
say
anything
against
that
so
sat
down
by
the
ingle
and
began
to
poke
about
in
the
ashes
just
as
he
used
to
do
when
he
lay
at
home
in
old
days
and
stretched
his
lazy
bones
well
they
chattered
and
talked
about
many
things
and
they
told
about
this
thing
and
that
and
so
he
asked
them
if
they
had
never
had
any
children
yes
yes
they
had
once
a
lad
whose
name
was
but
they
know
whither
he
had
wandered
they
could
even
tell
whether
he
were
dead
or
alive
could
it
be
me
now
said
let
me
see
i
could
tell
him
well
enough
said
the
old
wife
and
rose
up
our
was
so
lazy
and
dull
he
never
did
a
thing
and
besides
he
was
so
ragged
that
one
tatter
took
hold
of
the
next
tatter
on
him
no
there
never
was
the
making
of
such
a
fine
fellow
in
him
as
you
are
master
a
little
while
after
the
old
wife
went
to
the
hearth
to
poke
up
the
fire
and
when
the
blaze
fell
on
face
just
as
when
he
was
at
home
of
old
poking
about
in
the
ashes
she
knew
him
at
once
ah
but
it
is
you
after
all
she
cried
and
then
there
was
such
joy
for
the
old
couple
there
was
no
end
to
it
and
he
was
forced
to
tell
how
he
had
fared
and
the
old
dame
was
so
fond
and
proud
of
him
nothing
would
do
but
he
must
go
up
at
once
to
the
farmer
and
show
himself
to
the
lassies
who
had
always
looked
down
on
him
and
off
she
went
first
and
followed
after
so
when
she
got
up
there
she
told
them
all
how
had
come
home
again
and
now
they
should
only
just
see
how
grand
he
was
for
said
she
he
looks
like
nothing
but
a
king
son
all
very
fine
said
the
lassies
and
tossed
up
their
heads
be
bound
he
just
the
same
beggarly
ragged
boy
he
always
was
just
then
in
walked
and
then
the
lassies
were
all
so
taken
aback
they
forgot
their
sarks
in
the
ingle
where
they
were
sitting
darning
their
clothes
and
ran
out
in
their
smocks
well
when
they
were
got
back
again
they
were
so
shamefaced
they
scarce
dared
look
at
towards
whom
they
had
always
been
proud
and
haughty
aye
aye
said
you
always
thought
yourselves
so
pretty
and
neat
no
one
could
come
near
you
but
now
you
should
just
see
the
eldest
i
have
set
free
against
her
you
look
just
like
milkmaids
and
the
midmost
is
prettier
still
but
the
youngest
who
is
my
sweetheart
she
fairer
than
both
sun
and
moon
would
to
heaven
they
were
only
here
said
then
you
see
what
you
would
see
he
had
scarce
uttered
these
words
before
there
they
stood
but
then
he
felt
so
sorry
for
now
what
they
had
said
came
into
his
mind
up
at
the
farm
there
was
a
great
feast
got
ready
for
the
and
much
was
made
of
them
but
they
would
stop
there
no
we
want
to
go
down
to
your
father
and
mother
they
said
to
and
so
we
go
out
now
and
look
about
us
so
he
went
down
with
them
and
they
came
to
a
great
lake
just
outside
the
farm
close
by
the
water
was
such
a
lovely
green
bank
here
the
said
they
would
sit
and
rest
a
while
they
thought
it
so
sweet
to
sit
down
and
look
over
the
water
so
they
sat
down
there
and
when
they
had
sat
a
while
the
youngest
said
i
may
as
well
comb
your
hair
a
little
well
laid
his
head
on
her
lap
and
she
combed
his
bonny
locks
and
it
was
long
before
fell
fast
asleep
then
she
took
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
put
another
in
its
stead
and
she
said
now
hold
me
all
together
and
now
would
we
were
all
in
moria
so
when
woke
up
he
could
very
well
tell
that
he
had
lost
the
and
began
to
weep
and
wail
and
he
was
so
downcast
they
could
comfort
him
at
all
in
spite
of
all
his
father
and
mother
said
he
would
stop
there
but
took
farewell
of
them
and
said
he
was
safe
not
to
see
them
again
for
if
he
could
find
the
again
he
thought
it
not
worth
while
to
live
well
he
had
still
about
sixty
pounds
left
so
he
put
them
into
his
pocket
and
set
out
on
his
way
so
when
he
had
walked
a
while
he
met
a
man
with
a
tidy
horse
and
he
wanted
to
buy
it
and
began
to
chaffer
with
the
man
aye
said
the
man
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
thought
of
selling
him
but
if
we
could
strike
a
bargain
perhaps
what
do
you
want
for
him
asked
i
did
give
much
for
him
nor
is
he
worth
much
he
a
brave
horse
to
ride
but
he
ca
draw
at
all
still
he
strong
enough
to
carry
your
knapsack
and
you
too
turn
and
turn
about
said
the
man
at
last
they
agreed
on
the
price
and
laid
the
knapsack
on
him
and
so
he
walked
a
bit
and
rode
a
bit
turn
and
turn
about
at
night
he
came
to
a
green
plain
where
stood
a
great
tree
at
the
roots
of
which
he
sat
down
there
he
let
the
horse
loose
but
he
did
lie
down
to
sleep
but
opened
his
knapsack
and
took
a
meal
at
peep
of
day
off
he
set
again
for
he
could
take
no
rest
so
he
rode
and
walked
and
walked
and
rode
the
whole
day
through
the
wide
wood
where
there
were
so
many
green
spots
and
glades
that
shone
so
bright
and
lovely
between
the
trees
he
did
know
at
all
where
he
was
or
whither
he
was
going
but
he
gave
himself
no
more
time
to
rest
than
when
his
horse
cropped
a
bit
of
grass
and
he
took
a
snack
out
of
his
knapsack
when
they
came
to
one
of
those
green
glades
so
he
went
on
walking
and
riding
by
turns
and
as
for
the
wood
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
it
but
at
dusk
the
next
day
he
saw
a
light
gleaming
away
through
the
trees
would
there
were
folk
hereaway
thought
that
i
might
warm
myself
a
bit
and
get
a
morsel
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
when
he
got
up
to
it
he
saw
the
light
came
from
a
wretched
little
hut
and
through
the
window
he
saw
an
old
old
couple
inside
they
were
as
as
a
pair
of
doves
and
the
old
wife
had
such
a
nose
why
it
was
so
long
she
used
it
for
a
poker
to
stir
the
fire
as
she
sat
in
the
ingle
good
evening
said
good
evening
said
the
old
wife
but
what
errand
can
you
have
in
coming
hither
she
went
on
for
no
christian
folk
have
been
here
these
hundred
years
and
more
well
told
her
all
about
himself
and
how
he
wanted
to
get
to
moria
and
asked
if
she
knew
the
way
thither
no
said
the
old
wife
that
i
do
but
see
now
here
comes
the
moon
i
ask
her
she
know
all
about
it
for
does
she
shine
on
everything
so
when
the
moon
stood
clear
and
bright
over
the
the
old
wife
went
out
thou
moon
thou
moon
she
screamed
canst
thou
tell
me
the
way
to
moria
no
said
the
moon
that
i
ca
for
the
last
time
i
shone
there
a
cloud
stood
before
me
wait
a
bit
still
said
the
old
wife
to
bye
and
bye
comes
the
west
wind
he
sure
to
know
it
for
he
puffs
and
blows
round
every
corner
nay
nay
said
the
old
wife
when
she
went
out
again
you
do
mean
to
say
you
got
a
horse
too
just
turn
the
poor
beastie
loose
in
our
and
do
let
him
stand
there
and
starve
to
death
at
the
door
then
she
ran
on
but
wo
you
swop
him
away
to
me
we
got
an
old
pair
of
boots
here
with
which
you
can
take
twenty
miles
at
each
stride
those
you
shall
have
for
your
horse
and
so
you
get
all
the
sooner
to
moria
that
was
willing
to
do
at
once
and
the
old
wife
was
so
glad
at
having
the
horse
she
was
ready
to
dance
and
skip
for
joy
for
now
she
said
i
shall
be
able
to
ride
to
church
i
too
think
of
that
as
for
he
had
no
rest
and
wanted
to
be
off
at
once
but
the
old
wife
said
there
was
no
hurry
lie
down
on
the
bench
with
you
and
sleep
a
bit
for
we
no
bed
to
offer
you
and
i
watch
and
wake
you
when
the
west
wind
comes
so
after
a
while
up
came
the
west
wind
roaring
and
howling
along
till
the
walls
creaked
and
groaned
again
out
ran
the
old
wife
thou
west
wind
thou
west
wind
canst
thou
tell
me
the
way
to
moria
here
one
who
wants
to
get
thither
yes
i
know
it
very
well
said
the
west
wind
and
now
i
just
off
thither
to
dry
clothes
for
the
wedding
that
to
be
if
he
swift
of
foot
he
can
go
along
with
me
out
ran
you
have
to
stretch
your
legs
if
you
mean
to
keep
up
said
the
west
wind
so
off
he
set
over
field
and
hedge
and
hill
and
fell
and
had
hard
work
to
keep
up
well
said
the
west
wind
now
i
no
time
to
stay
with
you
any
longer
for
i
got
to
go
away
yonder
and
tear
down
a
strip
of
spruce
wood
first
before
i
go
to
the
to
dry
the
clothes
but
if
you
go
alongside
the
hill
you
come
to
a
lot
of
lassies
standing
washing
clothes
and
then
you
not
far
to
go
to
moria
in
a
little
while
came
upon
the
lassies
who
stood
washing
and
they
asked
if
he
had
seen
anything
of
the
west
wind
who
was
to
come
and
dry
the
clothes
for
the
wedding
aye
aye
that
i
have
said
he
only
gone
to
tear
down
a
strip
of
spruce
wood
it
not
be
long
before
he
here
and
then
he
asked
them
the
way
to
moria
so
they
put
him
into
the
right
way
and
when
he
got
to
the
castle
it
was
full
of
folk
and
horses
so
full
it
made
one
giddy
to
look
at
them
but
was
so
ragged
and
torn
from
having
followed
the
west
wind
through
bush
and
brier
and
bog
that
he
kept
on
one
side
and
would
show
himself
till
the
last
day
when
the
bridal
feast
was
to
be
so
when
all
as
was
then
right
and
fitting
were
to
drink
the
bride
and
bridegroom
health
and
wish
them
luck
and
when
the
cupbearer
was
to
drink
to
them
all
again
both
knights
and
squires
last
of
all
he
came
in
turn
to
he
drank
their
health
but
let
the
ring
which
the
had
put
upon
his
finger
as
he
lay
by
the
lake
fall
into
the
glass
and
bade
the
cupbearer
go
and
greet
the
bride
and
hand
her
the
glass
then
up
rose
the
from
the
board
at
once
who
is
most
worthy
to
have
one
of
us
she
said
he
that
has
set
us
free
or
he
that
here
sits
by
me
as
bridegroom
well
they
all
said
there
could
be
but
one
voice
and
will
as
to
that
and
when
heard
that
he
was
long
in
throwing
off
his
beggar
rags
and
arraying
himself
as
bridegroom
aye
aye
here
is
the
right
one
after
all
said
the
youngest
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
and
so
she
tossed
the
other
one
out
of
the
window
and
held
her
wedding
with
the
giant
who
had
no
heart
in
his
body
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
who
had
and
he
loved
them
so
much
that
he
could
never
bear
to
be
without
them
all
at
once
but
one
must
always
be
with
him
now
when
they
were
grown
up
six
were
to
set
off
to
woo
but
as
for
the
youngest
his
father
kept
him
at
home
and
the
others
were
to
bring
back
a
princess
for
him
to
the
palace
so
the
gave
the
six
the
finest
clothes
you
ever
set
eyes
on
so
fine
that
the
light
gleamed
from
them
a
long
way
off
and
each
had
his
horse
which
cost
many
many
hundred
pounds
and
so
they
set
off
now
when
they
had
been
to
many
palaces
and
seen
many
princesses
at
last
they
came
to
a
who
had
such
lovely
king
daughters
they
had
never
seen
and
so
they
fell
to
wooing
them
each
one
and
when
they
had
got
them
for
sweethearts
they
set
off
home
again
but
they
quite
forgot
that
they
were
to
bring
back
with
them
a
sweetheart
for
their
brother
who
stayed
at
home
for
they
were
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
their
own
sweethearts
illustration
the
six
brothers
riding
out
to
woo
but
when
they
had
gone
a
good
bit
on
their
way
they
passed
close
by
a
steep
like
a
wall
where
the
house
was
and
there
the
came
out
and
set
his
eyes
upon
them
and
turned
them
all
into
stone
princes
and
princesses
and
all
now
the
waited
and
waited
for
his
but
the
more
he
waited
the
longer
they
stayed
away
so
he
fell
into
great
trouble
and
said
he
should
never
know
what
it
was
to
be
glad
again
and
if
i
had
not
you
left
he
said
to
i
would
live
no
longer
so
full
of
sorrow
am
i
for
the
loss
of
your
brothers
well
but
now
i
been
thinking
to
ask
your
leave
to
set
out
and
find
them
again
that
what
i
thinking
of
said
nay
nay
said
his
father
that
leave
you
shall
never
get
for
then
you
would
stay
away
too
but
had
set
his
heart
upon
it
go
he
would
and
he
begged
and
prayed
so
long
that
the
was
forced
to
let
him
go
now
you
must
know
the
had
no
other
horse
to
give
but
an
old
jade
for
his
six
other
sons
and
their
train
had
carried
off
all
his
horses
but
did
not
care
a
pin
for
that
he
sprang
up
on
his
sorry
old
steed
farewell
father
said
he
i
come
back
never
fear
and
like
enough
i
shall
bring
my
six
brothers
back
with
me
and
with
that
he
rode
off
so
when
he
had
ridden
a
while
he
came
to
a
which
lay
in
the
road
and
flapped
its
wings
and
was
not
able
to
get
out
of
the
way
it
was
so
starved
oh
dear
friend
said
the
give
me
a
little
food
and
help
you
again
at
your
utmost
need
i
have
much
food
said
the
and
i
do
see
how
ever
be
able
to
help
me
much
but
still
i
can
spare
you
a
little
i
see
you
want
it
so
he
gave
the
raven
some
of
the
food
he
had
brought
with
him
now
when
he
had
gone
a
bit
further
he
came
to
a
brook
and
in
the
brook
lay
a
great
which
had
got
upon
a
dry
place
and
dashed
itself
about
and
could
not
get
into
the
water
again
oh
dear
friend
said
the
to
the
shove
me
out
into
the
water
again
and
i
help
you
again
at
your
utmost
need
well
said
the
the
help
you
give
me
will
not
be
great
i
daresay
but
it
a
pity
you
should
lie
there
and
choke
and
with
that
he
shot
the
fish
out
into
the
stream
again
after
that
he
went
a
long
long
way
and
there
met
him
a
which
was
so
famished
that
it
lay
and
crawled
along
the
road
on
its
belly
dear
friend
do
let
me
have
your
horse
said
the
i
so
hungry
the
wind
whistles
through
my
ribs
i
had
nothing
to
eat
these
two
years
no
said
this
will
never
do
first
i
came
to
a
raven
and
i
was
forced
to
give
him
my
food
next
i
came
to
a
salmon
and
him
i
had
to
help
into
the
water
again
and
now
you
will
have
my
horse
it
ca
be
done
that
it
ca
for
then
i
should
have
nothing
to
ride
on
nay
dear
friend
but
you
can
help
me
said
the
wolf
you
can
ride
upon
my
back
and
i
help
you
again
in
your
utmost
need
well
the
help
i
shall
get
from
you
will
not
be
great
i
be
bound
said
the
but
you
may
take
my
horse
since
you
are
in
such
need
so
when
the
had
eaten
the
horse
took
the
bit
and
put
it
into
the
jaw
and
laid
the
saddle
on
his
back
and
now
the
was
so
strong
after
what
he
had
got
inside
that
he
set
off
with
the
like
nothing
so
fast
he
had
never
ridden
before
when
we
have
gone
a
bit
farther
said
i
show
you
the
house
so
after
a
while
they
came
to
it
see
here
is
the
house
said
the
and
see
here
are
your
six
brothers
whom
the
has
turned
into
stone
and
see
here
are
their
six
brides
and
away
yonder
is
the
door
and
in
that
door
you
must
go
nay
but
i
dare
go
in
said
the
he
take
my
life
no
no
said
the
when
you
get
in
you
find
a
and
she
tell
you
what
to
do
to
make
an
end
of
the
only
mind
and
do
as
she
bids
you
well
went
in
but
truth
to
say
he
was
very
much
afraid
when
he
came
in
the
was
away
but
in
one
of
the
rooms
sat
the
just
as
the
had
said
and
so
lovely
a
princess
had
never
yet
set
eyes
on
oh
heaven
help
you
whence
have
you
come
said
the
as
she
saw
him
it
will
surely
be
your
death
no
one
can
make
an
end
of
the
who
lives
here
for
he
has
no
heart
in
his
body
well
well
said
but
now
that
i
am
here
i
may
as
well
try
what
i
can
do
with
him
and
i
will
see
if
i
ca
free
my
brothers
who
are
standing
turned
to
stone
out
of
doors
and
you
too
i
will
try
to
save
that
i
will
well
if
you
must
you
must
said
the
and
so
let
us
see
if
we
ca
hit
on
a
plan
just
creep
under
the
bed
yonder
and
mind
and
listen
to
what
he
and
i
talk
about
but
pray
do
lie
as
still
as
a
mouse
so
he
crept
under
the
bed
and
he
had
scarce
got
well
underneath
it
before
the
came
ha
roared
the
what
a
smell
of
christian
blood
there
is
in
the
house
yes
i
know
there
is
said
the
for
there
came
a
magpie
flying
with
a
man
bone
and
let
it
fall
down
the
chimney
i
made
all
the
haste
i
could
to
get
it
out
but
all
one
can
do
the
smell
go
off
so
soon
so
the
said
no
more
about
it
and
when
night
came
they
went
to
bed
after
they
had
lain
a
while
the
said
there
is
one
thing
i
be
so
glad
to
ask
you
about
if
i
only
dared
what
thing
is
that
asked
the
only
where
it
is
you
keep
your
heart
since
you
do
carry
it
about
you
said
the
ah
that
a
thing
you
no
business
to
ask
about
but
if
you
must
know
it
lies
under
the
said
the
ho
ho
said
to
himself
under
the
bed
then
we
soon
see
if
we
ca
find
it
next
morning
the
got
up
cruelly
early
and
strode
off
to
the
wood
but
he
was
hardly
out
of
the
house
before
and
the
set
to
work
to
look
under
the
for
his
heart
but
the
more
they
dug
and
the
more
they
hunted
the
more
they
find
it
he
has
baulked
us
this
time
said
the
but
we
try
him
once
more
so
she
picked
all
the
prettiest
flowers
she
could
find
and
strewed
them
over
the
which
they
had
laid
in
its
right
place
again
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
to
come
home
again
crept
under
the
bed
just
as
he
was
well
under
back
came
the
snuff
snuff
went
the
nose
my
eyes
and
limbs
what
a
smell
of
christian
blood
there
is
in
here
said
he
i
know
there
is
said
the
for
there
came
a
magpie
flying
with
a
man
bone
in
his
bill
and
let
it
fall
down
the
chimney
i
made
as
much
haste
as
i
could
to
get
it
out
but
i
daresay
it
that
you
smell
so
the
held
his
peace
and
said
no
more
about
it
a
little
while
after
he
asked
who
it
was
that
had
strewed
flowers
about
the
oh
i
of
course
said
the
and
pray
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
said
the
ah
said
the
i
so
fond
of
you
that
i
could
help
strewing
them
when
i
knew
that
your
heart
lay
under
there
you
do
say
so
said
the
but
after
all
it
does
lie
there
at
all
so
when
they
went
to
bed
again
in
the
evening
the
asked
the
again
where
his
heart
was
for
she
said
she
would
so
like
to
know
well
said
the
if
you
must
know
it
lies
away
yonder
in
the
cupboard
against
the
wall
so
so
thought
and
the
then
we
soon
try
to
find
it
next
morning
the
was
away
early
and
strode
off
to
the
wood
and
so
soon
as
he
was
gone
and
the
were
in
the
cupboard
hunting
for
his
heart
but
the
more
they
sought
for
it
the
less
they
found
it
well
said
the
we
just
try
him
once
more
so
she
decked
out
the
cupboard
with
flowers
and
garlands
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
to
come
home
crept
under
the
bed
again
then
back
came
the
snuff
snuff
my
eyes
and
limbs
what
a
smell
of
christian
blood
there
is
in
here
i
know
there
is
said
the
for
a
little
while
since
there
came
a
magpie
flying
with
a
man
bone
in
his
bill
and
let
it
fall
down
the
chimney
i
made
all
the
haste
i
could
to
get
it
out
of
the
house
again
but
after
all
my
pains
i
daresay
it
that
you
smell
when
the
heard
that
he
said
no
more
about
it
but
a
little
while
after
he
saw
how
the
cupboard
was
all
decked
about
with
flowers
and
garlands
so
he
asked
who
it
was
that
had
done
that
who
could
it
be
but
the
and
pray
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
tomfoolery
asked
the
oh
i
so
fond
of
you
i
could
help
doing
it
when
i
knew
that
your
heart
lay
there
said
the
how
can
you
be
so
silly
as
to
believe
any
such
thing
said
the
oh
yes
how
can
i
help
believing
it
when
you
say
it
said
the
you
a
goose
said
the
where
my
heart
is
you
will
never
come
well
said
the
but
for
all
that
be
such
a
pleasure
to
know
where
it
really
lies
then
the
poor
could
hold
out
no
longer
but
was
forced
to
say
illustration
on
that
island
stands
a
church
in
that
church
is
a
well
in
that
well
swims
a
duck
far
far
away
in
a
lake
lies
an
island
on
that
island
stands
a
church
in
that
church
is
a
well
in
that
well
swims
a
duck
in
that
duck
there
is
an
egg
and
in
that
egg
there
lies
my
heart
you
darling
in
the
morning
early
while
it
was
still
grey
dawn
the
strode
off
to
the
wood
illustration
he
took
a
long
long
farewell
of
the
princess
and
when
he
got
out
of
the
giant
door
there
stood
the
wolf
waiting
for
him
yes
now
i
must
set
off
too
said
if
i
only
knew
how
to
find
the
way
he
took
a
long
long
farewell
of
the
and
when
he
got
out
of
the
door
there
stood
the
waiting
for
him
so
told
him
all
that
had
happened
inside
the
house
and
said
now
he
wished
to
ride
to
the
well
in
the
church
if
he
only
knew
the
way
so
the
bade
him
jump
on
his
back
he
soon
find
the
way
and
away
they
went
till
the
wind
whistled
after
them
over
hedge
and
field
over
hill
and
dale
after
they
had
travelled
many
many
days
they
came
at
last
to
the
lake
then
the
did
not
know
how
to
get
over
it
but
the
bade
him
only
not
be
afraid
but
stick
on
and
so
he
jumped
into
the
lake
with
the
on
his
back
and
swam
over
to
the
island
so
they
came
to
the
church
but
the
church
keys
hung
high
high
up
on
the
top
of
the
tower
and
at
first
the
did
not
know
how
to
get
them
down
you
must
call
on
the
raven
said
the
so
the
called
on
the
raven
and
in
a
trice
the
raven
came
and
flew
up
and
fetched
the
keys
and
so
the
got
into
the
church
but
when
he
came
to
the
well
there
lay
the
duck
and
swam
about
backwards
and
forwards
just
as
the
had
said
so
the
stood
and
coaxed
it
till
it
came
to
him
and
he
grasped
it
in
his
hand
but
just
as
he
lifted
it
up
from
the
water
the
duck
dropped
the
egg
into
the
well
and
then
was
beside
himself
to
know
how
to
get
it
out
again
well
now
you
must
call
on
the
salmon
to
be
sure
said
the
and
the
king
son
called
on
the
salmon
and
the
salmon
came
and
fetched
up
the
egg
from
the
bottom
of
the
well
then
the
told
him
to
squeeze
the
egg
and
as
soon
as
ever
he
squeezed
it
the
screamed
out
squeeze
it
again
said
the
and
when
the
did
so
the
screamed
still
more
piteously
and
begged
and
prayed
so
prettily
to
be
spared
saying
he
would
do
all
that
the
wished
if
he
would
only
not
squeeze
his
heart
in
two
tell
him
if
he
will
restore
to
life
again
your
six
brothers
and
their
brides
whom
he
has
turned
to
stone
you
will
spare
his
life
said
the
yes
the
was
ready
to
do
that
and
he
turned
the
six
brothers
into
king
sons
again
and
their
brides
into
daughters
now
squeeze
the
egg
in
two
said
the
so
squeezed
the
egg
to
pieces
and
the
burst
at
once
now
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
the
rode
back
again
on
the
to
the
house
and
there
stood
all
his
six
brothers
alive
and
merry
with
their
brides
then
went
into
the
after
his
bride
and
so
they
all
set
off
home
again
to
their
father
house
and
you
may
fancy
how
glad
the
old
king
was
when
he
saw
all
his
seven
sons
come
back
each
with
his
bride
but
the
loveliest
bride
of
all
is
the
bride
of
after
all
said
the
king
and
he
shall
sit
uppermost
at
the
table
with
her
by
his
side
so
he
sent
out
and
called
a
great
and
the
mirth
was
both
loud
and
long
and
if
they
have
not
done
feasting
why
they
are
still
at
it
the
princess
on
the
glass
hill
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
man
who
had
a
meadow
which
lay
high
up
on
the
and
in
the
meadow
was
a
barn
which
he
had
built
to
keep
his
hay
in
now
i
must
tell
you
there
had
been
much
in
the
barn
for
the
last
year
or
two
for
every
john
night
when
the
grass
stood
greenest
and
deepest
the
meadow
was
eaten
down
to
the
very
ground
the
next
morning
just
as
if
a
whole
drove
of
sheep
had
been
there
feeding
on
it
over
night
this
happened
once
and
it
happened
twice
so
at
last
the
man
grew
weary
of
losing
his
crop
of
hay
and
said
to
his
sons
for
he
had
three
of
them
and
the
youngest
was
nicknamed
of
course
that
now
one
of
them
must
go
and
sleep
in
the
barn
in
the
outlying
field
when
john
night
came
for
it
was
too
good
a
joke
that
his
grass
should
be
eaten
root
and
blade
this
year
as
it
had
been
the
last
two
years
so
whichever
of
them
went
must
keep
a
sharp
that
was
what
their
father
said
well
the
eldest
son
was
ready
to
go
and
watch
the
meadow
trust
him
for
looking
after
the
grass
it
should
be
his
fault
if
man
or
beast
or
the
fiend
himself
got
a
blade
of
grass
so
when
evening
came
he
set
off
to
the
barn
and
lay
down
to
sleep
but
a
little
on
in
the
night
came
such
a
clatter
and
such
an
earthquake
that
walls
and
roof
shook
and
groaned
and
creaked
then
up
jumped
the
lad
and
took
to
his
heels
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
nor
dared
he
once
look
round
till
he
reached
home
and
as
for
the
hay
why
it
was
eaten
up
this
year
just
as
it
had
been
twice
before
the
next
john
night
the
man
said
again
it
would
never
do
to
lose
all
the
grass
in
the
outlying
field
year
after
year
in
this
way
so
one
of
his
sons
must
just
trudge
off
to
watch
it
and
watch
it
well
too
well
the
next
oldest
son
was
ready
to
try
his
luck
so
he
set
off
and
lay
down
to
sleep
in
the
barn
as
his
brother
had
done
before
him
but
as
the
night
wore
on
there
came
on
a
rumbling
and
quaking
of
the
earth
worse
even
than
on
the
last
john
night
and
when
the
lad
heard
it
he
got
frightened
and
took
to
his
heels
as
though
he
were
running
a
race
next
year
the
turn
came
to
but
when
he
made
ready
to
go
the
other
two
began
to
laugh
and
to
make
game
of
him
saying
you
just
the
man
to
watch
the
hay
that
you
are
you
who
have
done
nothing
all
your
life
but
sit
in
the
ashes
and
toast
yourself
by
the
fire
but
did
not
care
a
pin
for
their
chattering
and
stumped
away
as
evening
grew
on
up
the
to
the
outlying
field
there
he
went
inside
the
barn
and
lay
down
but
in
about
an
hour
time
the
barn
began
to
groan
and
creak
so
that
it
was
dreadful
to
hear
well
said
to
himself
if
it
is
worse
than
this
i
can
stand
it
well
enough
a
little
while
after
came
another
creak
and
an
earthquake
so
that
the
litter
in
the
barn
flew
about
the
lad
ears
oh
said
to
himself
if
it
is
worse
than
this
i
daresay
i
can
stand
it
out
but
just
then
came
a
third
rumbling
and
a
third
earthquake
so
that
the
lad
thought
walls
and
roof
were
coming
down
on
his
head
but
it
passed
off
and
all
was
still
as
death
about
him
it
come
again
i
be
bound
thought
but
no
it
come
again
still
it
was
and
still
it
stayed
but
after
he
had
lain
a
little
while
he
heard
a
noise
as
if
a
horse
were
standing
just
outside
the
and
cropping
the
grass
he
stole
to
the
door
and
peeped
through
a
chink
and
there
stood
a
horse
feeding
away
so
big
and
fat
and
grand
a
horse
had
never
set
eyes
on
by
his
side
on
the
grass
lay
a
saddle
and
bridle
and
a
full
set
of
armour
for
a
knight
all
of
brass
so
bright
that
the
light
gleamed
from
it
ho
ho
thought
the
lad
it
you
is
it
that
eats
up
our
hay
i
soon
put
a
spoke
in
your
wheel
just
see
if
i
do
so
he
lost
no
time
but
took
the
steel
out
of
his
and
threw
it
over
the
horse
then
it
had
no
power
to
stir
from
the
spot
and
became
so
tame
that
the
lad
could
do
what
he
liked
with
it
so
he
got
on
its
back
and
rode
off
with
it
to
a
place
which
no
one
knew
of
and
there
he
put
up
the
horse
when
he
got
home
his
brothers
laughed
and
asked
how
he
had
fared
you
did
lie
long
in
the
barn
even
if
you
had
the
heart
to
go
so
far
as
the
field
well
said
all
i
can
say
is
i
lay
in
the
barn
till
the
sun
rose
and
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
i
ca
think
what
there
was
in
the
barn
to
make
you
both
so
afraid
a
pretty
story
said
his
brothers
but
we
soon
see
how
you
have
watched
the
meadow
so
they
set
off
but
when
they
reached
it
there
stood
the
grass
as
deep
and
thick
as
it
had
been
over
night
well
the
next
john
eve
it
was
the
same
story
over
again
neither
of
the
elder
brothers
dared
to
go
out
to
the
outlying
field
to
watch
the
crop
but
he
had
the
heart
to
go
and
everything
happened
just
as
it
had
happened
the
year
before
first
a
clatter
and
an
earthquake
then
a
greater
clatter
and
another
earthquake
and
so
on
a
third
time
only
this
year
the
earthquakes
were
far
worse
than
the
year
before
then
all
at
once
everything
was
as
still
as
death
and
the
lad
heard
how
something
was
cropping
the
grass
outside
the
so
he
stole
to
the
door
and
peeped
through
a
chink
and
what
do
you
think
he
saw
why
another
horse
standing
right
up
against
the
wall
and
chewing
and
champing
with
might
and
main
it
was
far
finer
and
fatter
than
that
which
came
the
year
before
and
it
had
a
saddle
on
its
back
and
a
bridle
on
its
neck
and
a
full
suit
of
mail
for
a
knight
lay
by
its
side
all
of
silver
and
as
grand
as
you
would
wish
to
see
ho
ho
said
to
himself
it
you
that
gobbles
up
our
hay
is
it
i
soon
put
a
spoke
in
your
wheel
and
with
that
he
took
the
steel
out
of
his
and
threw
it
over
the
horse
crest
which
stood
as
still
as
a
lamb
well
the
lad
rode
this
horse
too
to
the
where
he
kept
the
other
one
and
after
that
he
went
home
i
suppose
you
tell
us
said
one
of
his
brothers
there
a
fine
crop
this
year
too
up
in
the
hayfield
well
so
there
is
said
and
off
ran
the
others
to
see
and
there
stood
the
grass
thick
and
deep
as
it
was
the
year
before
but
they
did
give
softer
words
for
all
that
now
when
the
third
john
eve
came
the
two
elder
brothers
still
had
the
heart
to
lie
out
in
the
barn
and
watch
the
grass
for
they
had
got
so
scared
at
heart
the
nights
they
lay
there
before
that
they
could
get
over
the
fright
but
he
dared
to
go
and
to
make
a
very
long
story
short
the
very
same
thing
happened
this
time
as
had
happened
twice
before
three
earthquakes
came
one
after
the
other
each
worse
than
the
one
which
went
before
and
when
the
last
came
the
lad
danced
about
with
the
shock
from
one
barn
wall
to
the
other
and
after
that
all
at
once
it
was
still
as
death
now
when
he
had
laid
a
little
while
he
heard
something
tugging
away
at
the
grass
outside
the
barn
so
he
stole
again
to
the
and
peeped
out
and
there
stood
a
horse
close
outside
far
far
bigger
and
fatter
than
the
two
he
had
taken
before
ho
ho
said
the
lad
to
himself
it
you
is
it
that
comes
here
eating
up
our
hay
i
soon
stop
that
i
soon
put
a
spoke
in
your
wheel
so
he
caught
up
his
steel
and
threw
it
over
his
horse
neck
and
in
a
trice
it
stood
as
if
it
were
nailed
to
the
ground
and
could
do
as
he
pleased
with
it
then
he
rode
off
with
it
to
the
where
he
kept
the
other
two
and
then
went
home
when
he
got
home
his
two
brothers
made
game
of
him
as
they
had
done
before
saying
they
could
see
he
had
watched
the
grass
well
for
he
looked
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
were
walking
in
his
sleep
and
many
other
spiteful
things
they
said
but
gave
no
heed
to
them
only
asking
them
to
go
and
see
for
themselves
and
when
they
went
there
stood
the
grass
as
fine
and
deep
this
time
as
it
had
been
twice
before
now
you
must
know
that
the
king
of
the
country
where
lived
had
a
daughter
whom
he
would
only
give
to
the
man
who
could
ride
up
over
the
hill
of
glass
for
there
was
a
high
high
hill
all
of
glass
as
smooth
and
slippery
as
ice
close
by
the
palace
upon
the
tip
top
of
the
hill
the
daughter
was
to
sit
with
three
golden
apples
in
her
lap
and
the
man
who
could
ride
up
and
carry
off
the
three
golden
apples
was
to
have
half
the
kingdom
and
the
to
wife
this
the
had
stuck
up
on
all
the
in
his
realm
and
had
given
it
out
in
many
other
kingdoms
besides
now
this
was
so
lovely
that
all
who
set
eyes
on
her
fell
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
whether
they
would
or
no
so
i
need
tell
you
how
all
the
princes
and
knights
who
heard
of
her
were
eager
to
win
her
to
wife
and
half
the
kingdom
beside
and
how
they
came
riding
from
all
parts
of
the
world
on
high
prancing
horses
and
clad
in
the
grandest
clothes
for
there
one
of
them
who
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
and
he
alone
was
to
win
the
so
when
the
day
of
trial
came
which
the
king
had
fixed
there
was
such
a
crowd
of
princes
and
knights
under
the
that
it
made
one
head
whirl
to
look
at
them
and
everyone
in
the
country
who
could
even
crawl
along
was
off
to
the
hill
for
they
were
all
eager
to
see
the
man
who
was
to
win
the
so
the
two
elder
brothers
set
off
with
the
rest
but
as
for
they
said
outright
he
should
go
with
them
for
if
they
were
seen
with
such
a
dirty
changeling
all
begrimed
with
smut
from
cleaning
their
shoes
and
sifting
cinders
in
the
they
said
folk
would
make
game
of
them
very
well
said
it
all
one
to
me
i
can
go
alone
and
stand
or
fall
by
myself
now
when
the
two
brothers
came
to
the
of
the
knights
and
princes
were
all
hard
at
it
riding
their
horses
till
they
were
all
in
a
foam
but
it
was
no
good
by
my
troth
for
as
soon
as
ever
the
horses
set
foot
on
the
hill
down
they
slipped
and
there
was
one
who
could
get
a
yard
or
two
up
and
no
wonder
for
the
hill
was
as
smooth
as
a
sheet
of
glass
and
as
steep
as
a
but
all
were
eager
to
have
the
and
half
the
kingdom
so
they
rode
and
slipped
and
slipped
and
rode
and
still
it
was
the
same
story
over
again
at
last
all
their
horses
were
so
weary
that
they
could
scarce
lift
a
leg
and
in
such
a
sweat
that
the
lather
dripped
from
them
and
so
the
knights
had
to
give
up
trying
any
more
so
the
king
was
just
thinking
that
he
would
proclaim
a
new
trial
for
the
next
day
to
see
if
they
would
have
better
luck
when
all
at
once
a
knight
came
riding
up
on
so
brave
a
steed
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
the
like
of
it
in
his
born
days
and
the
knight
had
mail
of
brass
and
the
horse
a
brass
bit
in
his
mouth
so
bright
that
the
sunbeams
shone
from
it
then
all
the
others
called
out
to
him
he
might
just
as
well
spare
himself
the
trouble
of
riding
at
the
hill
for
it
would
lead
to
no
good
but
he
gave
no
heed
to
them
and
put
his
horse
at
the
hill
and
went
up
it
like
nothing
for
a
good
way
about
a
third
of
the
height
and
when
he
had
got
so
far
he
turned
his
horse
round
and
rode
down
again
so
lovely
a
knight
the
thought
she
had
never
yet
seen
and
while
he
was
riding
she
sat
and
thought
to
herself
would
to
heaven
he
might
only
come
up
and
down
the
other
side
and
when
she
saw
him
turning
back
she
threw
down
one
of
the
golden
apples
after
him
and
it
rolled
down
into
his
shoe
but
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
rode
off
so
fast
that
no
one
could
tell
what
had
become
of
him
that
evening
all
the
knights
and
princes
were
to
go
before
the
king
that
he
who
had
ridden
so
far
up
the
hill
might
show
the
apple
which
the
had
thrown
but
there
was
no
one
who
had
anything
to
show
one
after
the
other
they
all
came
but
not
a
man
of
them
could
show
the
apple
at
even
the
brothers
of
came
home
too
and
had
such
a
long
story
to
tell
about
the
riding
up
the
hill
first
of
all
they
said
there
was
not
one
of
the
whole
lot
who
could
get
so
much
as
a
stride
up
but
at
last
came
one
who
had
a
suit
of
brass
mail
and
a
brass
bridle
and
saddle
all
so
bright
that
the
sun
shone
from
them
a
mile
off
he
was
a
chap
to
ride
just
he
rode
a
third
of
the
way
up
the
of
and
he
could
easily
have
ridden
the
whole
way
up
if
he
chose
but
he
turned
round
and
rode
down
thinking
maybe
that
was
enough
for
once
oh
i
should
so
like
to
have
seen
him
that
i
should
said
who
sat
by
the
fireside
and
stuck
his
feet
into
the
cinders
as
was
his
wont
oh
said
his
brothers
you
would
would
you
you
look
fit
to
keep
company
with
such
high
lords
nasty
beast
that
you
are
sitting
there
amongst
the
ashes
next
day
the
brothers
were
all
for
setting
off
again
and
begged
them
this
time
too
to
let
him
go
with
them
and
see
the
riding
but
no
they
would
have
him
at
any
price
he
was
too
ugly
and
nasty
they
said
well
well
said
if
i
go
at
all
i
must
go
by
myself
not
afraid
so
when
the
brothers
got
to
the
of
all
the
princes
and
knights
began
to
ride
again
and
you
may
fancy
they
had
taken
care
to
shoe
their
horses
sharp
but
it
was
no
good
they
rode
and
slipped
and
slipped
and
rode
just
as
they
had
done
the
day
before
and
there
was
not
one
who
could
get
so
far
as
a
yard
up
the
hill
and
when
they
had
worn
out
their
horses
so
that
they
could
not
stir
a
leg
they
were
all
forced
to
give
it
up
as
a
bad
job
so
the
king
thought
he
might
as
well
proclaim
that
the
riding
should
take
place
the
day
after
for
the
last
time
just
to
give
them
one
chance
more
but
all
at
once
it
came
across
his
mind
that
he
might
as
well
wait
a
little
longer
to
see
if
the
knight
in
brass
mail
would
come
this
day
too
well
they
saw
nothing
of
him
but
all
at
once
came
one
riding
on
a
steed
far
far
braver
and
finer
than
that
on
which
the
knight
in
brass
had
ridden
and
he
had
silver
mail
and
a
silver
saddle
and
bridle
all
so
bright
that
the
sunbeams
gleamed
and
glanced
from
them
far
away
then
the
others
shouted
out
to
him
again
saying
he
might
as
well
hold
hard
and
not
try
to
ride
up
the
hill
for
all
his
trouble
would
be
thrown
away
but
the
knight
paid
no
heed
to
them
and
rode
straight
at
the
hill
and
right
up
it
till
he
had
gone
of
the
way
and
then
he
wheeled
his
horse
round
and
rode
down
again
to
tell
the
truth
the
liked
him
still
better
than
the
knight
in
brass
and
she
sat
and
wished
he
might
only
be
able
to
come
right
up
to
the
top
and
down
the
other
side
but
when
she
saw
him
turning
back
she
threw
the
second
apple
after
him
and
it
rolled
down
and
fell
into
his
shoe
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
had
come
down
from
the
of
he
rode
off
so
fast
that
no
one
could
see
what
became
of
him
at
even
when
all
were
to
go
in
before
the
king
and
the
that
he
who
had
the
golden
apple
might
show
it
in
they
went
one
after
the
other
but
there
was
no
one
who
had
any
apple
to
show
and
the
two
brothers
as
they
had
done
on
the
former
day
went
home
and
told
how
things
had
gone
and
how
all
had
ridden
at
the
hill
and
none
got
up
but
last
of
all
they
said
came
one
in
a
silver
suit
and
his
horse
had
a
silver
saddle
and
a
silver
bridle
he
was
just
a
chap
to
ride
and
he
got
up
the
hill
and
then
turned
back
he
was
a
fine
fellow
and
no
mistake
and
the
threw
the
second
gold
apple
to
him
oh
said
i
should
so
like
to
have
seen
him
too
that
i
should
a
pretty
story
they
said
perhaps
you
think
his
coat
of
mail
was
as
bright
as
the
ashes
you
are
always
poking
about
and
sifting
you
nasty
dirty
beast
the
third
day
everything
happened
as
it
had
happened
the
two
days
before
begged
to
go
and
see
the
sight
but
the
two
hear
of
his
going
with
them
when
they
got
to
the
hill
there
was
no
one
who
could
get
so
much
as
a
yard
up
it
and
now
all
waited
for
the
knight
in
silver
mail
but
they
neither
saw
nor
heard
of
him
at
last
came
one
riding
on
a
steed
so
brave
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
his
match
and
the
knight
had
a
suit
of
golden
mail
and
a
golden
saddle
and
bridle
so
wondrous
bright
that
the
sunbeams
gleamed
from
them
a
mile
off
the
other
knights
and
princes
could
not
find
time
to
call
out
to
him
not
to
try
his
luck
for
they
were
amazed
to
see
how
grand
he
was
so
he
rode
right
at
the
hill
and
tore
up
it
like
nothing
so
that
the
had
even
time
to
wish
that
he
might
get
up
the
whole
way
as
soon
as
ever
he
reached
the
top
he
took
the
third
golden
apple
from
the
lap
and
then
turned
his
horse
and
rode
down
again
as
soon
as
he
got
down
he
rode
off
at
full
speed
and
was
out
of
sight
in
no
time
now
when
the
brothers
got
home
at
even
you
may
fancy
what
long
stories
they
told
how
the
riding
had
gone
off
that
day
and
amongst
other
things
they
had
a
deal
to
say
about
the
knight
in
golden
mail
he
just
was
a
chap
to
ride
they
said
so
grand
a
knight
is
to
be
found
in
the
wide
world
oh
said
i
should
so
like
to
have
seen
him
that
i
should
ah
said
his
brothers
his
mail
shone
a
deal
brighter
than
the
glowing
coals
which
you
are
always
poking
and
digging
at
nasty
dirty
beast
that
you
are
next
day
all
the
knights
and
princes
were
to
pass
before
the
king
and
the
it
was
too
late
to
do
so
the
night
before
i
suppose
that
he
who
had
the
gold
apple
might
bring
it
forth
but
one
came
after
another
first
the
and
then
the
knights
and
still
no
one
could
show
the
gold
apple
well
said
the
king
some
one
must
have
it
for
it
was
something
we
all
saw
with
our
own
eyes
how
a
man
came
and
rode
up
and
bore
it
off
so
he
commanded
that
every
man
who
was
in
the
kingdom
should
come
up
to
the
palace
and
see
if
they
could
show
the
apple
well
they
all
came
one
after
another
but
no
one
had
the
golden
apple
and
after
a
long
time
the
two
brothers
of
came
they
were
the
last
of
all
so
the
king
asked
them
if
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
kingdom
who
had
come
oh
yes
said
they
we
have
a
brother
but
he
never
carried
off
the
golden
apple
he
has
stirred
out
of
the
dusthole
on
any
of
the
three
days
never
mind
that
said
the
king
he
may
as
well
come
up
to
the
palace
like
the
rest
so
had
to
go
up
to
the
palace
how
now
said
the
king
have
you
got
the
golden
apple
speak
out
yes
i
have
said
here
is
the
first
and
here
is
the
second
and
here
is
the
third
too
and
with
that
he
pulled
all
three
golden
apples
out
of
his
pocket
and
at
the
same
time
threw
off
his
sooty
rags
and
stood
before
them
in
his
gleaming
golden
mail
yes
said
the
king
you
shall
have
my
daughter
and
half
my
kingdom
for
you
well
deserve
both
her
and
it
so
they
got
ready
for
the
wedding
and
got
the
to
wife
and
there
was
great
at
the
you
may
fancy
for
they
could
all
be
merry
though
they
could
ride
up
the
of
and
all
i
can
say
is
if
they
have
left
off
their
yet
why
they
still
at
it
the
widow
son
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
poor
poor
who
had
an
only
she
dragged
on
with
the
boy
till
he
had
been
confirmed
and
then
she
said
she
could
feed
him
any
longer
he
must
just
go
out
and
earn
his
own
bread
so
the
lad
wandered
out
into
the
world
and
when
he
had
walked
a
day
or
so
a
strange
man
met
him
whither
away
asked
the
man
illustration
when
he
had
walked
a
day
or
so
a
strange
man
met
him
whither
away
asked
the
man
oh
i
going
out
into
the
world
to
try
and
get
a
place
said
the
lad
will
you
come
and
serve
me
said
the
man
oh
yes
just
as
soon
you
as
any
one
else
said
the
lad
well
you
have
a
good
place
with
me
said
the
man
for
only
have
to
keep
me
company
and
do
nothing
at
all
else
beside
so
the
lad
stopped
with
him
and
lived
on
the
fat
of
the
land
both
in
meat
and
drink
and
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
but
he
never
saw
a
living
soul
in
that
man
house
so
one
day
the
man
said
now
i
going
off
for
eight
days
and
that
time
you
have
to
spend
here
all
alone
but
you
must
not
go
into
any
one
of
these
four
rooms
here
if
you
do
i
take
your
life
when
i
come
back
no
said
the
lad
he
be
sure
not
to
do
that
but
when
the
man
had
been
gone
three
or
four
days
the
lad
could
bear
it
any
longer
but
went
into
the
first
room
and
when
he
got
inside
he
looked
round
but
he
saw
nothing
but
a
shelf
over
the
door
where
a
rod
lay
well
indeed
thought
the
lad
a
pretty
thing
to
forbid
my
seeing
this
so
when
the
eight
days
were
out
the
man
came
home
and
the
first
thing
he
said
was
you
have
been
into
any
of
these
rooms
of
course
no
no
that
i
have
said
the
lad
i
soon
see
that
said
the
man
and
went
at
once
into
the
room
where
the
lad
had
been
nay
but
you
have
been
in
here
said
he
and
now
you
shall
lose
your
life
then
the
lad
begged
and
prayed
so
hard
that
he
got
off
with
his
life
but
the
man
gave
him
a
good
thrashing
and
when
it
was
over
they
were
as
good
friends
as
ever
some
time
after
the
man
set
off
again
and
said
he
should
be
away
fourteen
days
but
before
he
went
he
forbade
the
lad
to
go
into
any
of
the
rooms
he
had
not
been
in
before
as
for
that
he
had
been
in
he
might
go
into
that
and
welcome
well
it
was
the
same
story
over
again
except
that
the
lad
stood
out
eight
days
before
he
went
in
in
this
room
too
he
saw
nothing
but
a
shelf
over
the
door
and
a
big
stone
and
a
pitcher
of
water
on
it
well
after
all
there
not
much
to
be
afraid
of
my
seeing
here
thought
the
lad
but
when
the
man
came
back
he
asked
if
he
had
been
into
any
of
the
rooms
no
the
lad
had
done
anything
of
the
kind
well
well
i
soon
see
that
said
the
man
and
when
he
saw
the
lad
had
been
in
them
after
all
he
said
ah
now
i
spare
you
no
longer
now
you
must
lose
your
life
but
the
lad
begged
and
prayed
for
himself
again
and
so
this
time
too
he
got
off
with
stripes
though
he
got
as
many
as
his
skin
would
carry
but
when
he
got
sound
and
well
again
he
led
just
as
easy
a
life
as
ever
and
he
and
the
man
were
just
as
good
friends
so
a
while
after
the
man
was
to
take
another
journey
and
now
he
said
he
should
be
away
three
weeks
and
he
forbade
the
lad
anew
to
go
into
the
third
room
for
if
he
went
in
there
he
might
just
make
up
his
mind
at
once
to
lose
his
life
then
after
fourteen
days
the
lad
bear
it
but
crept
into
the
room
but
he
saw
nothing
at
all
in
there
but
a
trap
door
on
the
floor
and
when
he
lifted
it
up
and
looked
down
there
stood
a
great
copper
cauldron
which
bubbled
up
and
boiled
away
down
there
but
he
saw
no
fire
under
it
well
i
should
just
like
to
know
if
it
hot
thought
the
lad
and
struck
his
finger
down
into
the
broth
and
when
he
pulled
it
out
again
lo
it
was
gilded
all
over
so
the
lad
scraped
and
scrubbed
it
but
the
gilding
would
go
off
so
he
bound
a
piece
of
rag
round
it
and
when
the
man
came
back
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
with
his
finger
the
lad
said
he
given
it
such
a
bad
cut
but
the
man
tore
off
the
rag
and
then
he
soon
saw
what
was
the
matter
with
the
finger
first
he
wanted
to
kill
the
lad
outright
but
when
he
wept
and
begged
he
only
gave
him
such
a
thrashing
that
he
had
to
keep
his
bed
three
days
after
that
the
man
took
down
a
pot
from
the
wall
and
rubbed
him
over
with
some
stuff
out
of
it
and
so
the
lad
was
as
sound
and
fresh
as
ever
so
after
a
while
the
man
started
off
again
and
this
time
he
was
to
be
away
a
month
but
before
he
went
he
said
to
the
lad
if
he
went
into
the
fourth
room
he
might
give
up
all
hope
of
saving
his
life
well
the
lad
stood
out
for
two
or
three
weeks
but
then
he
hold
out
any
longer
he
must
and
would
go
into
that
room
and
so
in
he
stole
there
stood
a
great
black
horse
tied
up
in
a
stall
by
himself
with
a
manger
of
coals
at
his
head
and
a
truss
of
hay
at
his
tail
then
the
lad
thought
this
all
wrong
so
he
changed
them
about
and
put
the
hay
at
his
head
then
said
the
since
you
are
so
good
at
heart
as
to
let
me
have
some
food
i
set
you
free
that
i
will
for
if
the
comes
back
and
finds
you
here
he
kill
you
outright
but
now
you
must
go
up
to
the
room
which
lies
just
over
this
and
take
a
coat
of
mail
out
of
those
that
hang
there
and
mind
whatever
you
do
do
take
any
of
the
bright
ones
but
the
most
rusty
of
all
you
see
that
the
one
to
take
and
sword
and
saddle
you
must
choose
for
yourself
just
in
the
same
way
so
the
lad
did
all
that
but
it
was
a
heavy
load
for
him
to
carry
them
all
down
at
once
when
he
came
back
the
told
him
to
pull
off
his
clothes
and
get
into
the
cauldron
which
stood
and
boiled
in
the
other
room
and
bathe
himself
there
if
i
do
thought
the
lad
i
shall
look
an
awful
fright
but
for
all
that
he
did
as
he
was
told
so
when
he
had
taken
his
bath
he
became
so
handsome
and
sleek
and
as
red
and
white
as
milk
and
blood
and
much
stronger
than
he
had
been
before
do
you
feel
any
change
asked
the
yes
said
the
lad
try
and
lift
me
then
said
the
oh
yes
he
could
do
that
and
as
for
the
sword
he
brandished
it
like
a
feather
now
saddle
me
said
the
and
put
on
the
coat
of
mail
and
then
take
the
rod
and
the
stone
and
the
pitcher
of
water
and
the
pot
of
ointment
and
then
we
be
off
as
fast
as
we
can
so
when
the
lad
had
got
on
the
horse
off
they
went
at
such
a
rate
he
could
at
all
tell
how
they
went
but
when
he
had
ridden
awhile
the
said
i
think
i
hear
a
noise
look
round
can
you
see
anything
yes
there
are
ever
so
many
coming
after
us
at
least
a
score
said
the
lad
aye
aye
that
the
coming
said
the
now
after
us
with
his
pack
so
they
rode
on
a
while
until
those
who
followed
were
close
behind
them
now
throw
your
rod
behind
you
over
your
shoulder
said
the
but
mind
you
throw
it
a
good
way
off
my
back
so
the
lad
did
that
and
all
at
once
a
close
thick
bramblewood
grew
up
behind
them
so
the
lad
rode
on
a
long
long
time
while
the
and
his
crew
had
to
go
home
to
fetch
something
to
hew
their
way
through
the
wood
but
at
last
the
said
again
look
behind
you
can
you
see
anything
now
yes
ever
so
many
said
the
lad
as
many
as
would
fill
a
large
church
aye
aye
that
the
and
his
crew
said
the
now
he
got
more
to
back
him
but
now
throw
down
the
stone
and
mind
you
throw
it
far
behind
me
and
as
soon
as
the
lad
did
what
the
said
up
rose
a
great
black
hill
of
rock
behind
him
so
the
had
to
be
off
home
to
fetch
something
to
mine
his
way
through
the
rock
and
while
the
did
that
the
lad
rode
a
good
bit
further
on
but
still
the
begged
him
to
look
behind
him
and
then
he
saw
a
troop
like
a
whole
army
behind
him
and
they
glistened
in
the
sunbeams
illustration
but
still
the
horse
begged
him
to
look
behind
him
aye
aye
said
the
that
the
and
now
he
got
his
whole
band
with
him
so
throw
the
pitcher
of
water
behind
you
but
mind
you
do
spill
any
of
it
upon
me
so
the
lad
did
that
but
in
spite
of
all
the
pains
he
took
he
still
spilt
one
drop
on
the
horse
flank
so
it
became
a
great
deep
lake
and
because
of
that
one
drop
the
horse
found
himself
far
out
in
it
but
still
he
swam
safe
to
land
but
when
the
came
to
the
lake
they
lay
down
to
drink
it
dry
and
so
they
swilled
and
swilled
till
they
burst
now
we
rid
of
them
said
the
so
when
they
had
gone
a
long
long
while
they
came
to
a
green
patch
in
a
wood
now
strip
off
all
your
arms
said
the
and
only
put
on
your
ragged
clothes
and
take
the
saddle
off
me
and
let
me
loose
and
hang
all
my
clothing
and
your
arms
up
inside
that
great
hollow
yonder
then
make
yourself
a
wig
of
and
go
up
to
the
king
palace
which
lies
close
here
and
ask
for
a
place
whenever
you
need
me
only
come
here
and
shake
the
bridle
and
come
to
you
yes
the
lad
did
all
his
told
him
and
as
soon
as
ever
he
put
on
the
wig
of
moss
he
became
so
ugly
and
pale
and
miserable
to
look
at
no
one
would
have
known
him
again
then
he
went
up
to
the
palace
and
begged
first
for
leave
to
be
in
the
kitchen
and
bring
in
wood
and
water
for
the
cook
but
then
the
asked
him
why
do
you
wear
that
ugly
wig
off
with
it
i
wo
have
such
a
fright
in
here
no
i
ca
do
that
said
the
lad
for
i
not
quite
right
in
my
head
do
you
think
then
i
have
you
in
here
about
the
food
cried
the
cook
away
with
you
to
the
coachman
you
best
fit
to
go
and
clean
the
stable
but
when
the
coachman
begged
him
to
take
his
wig
off
he
got
the
same
answer
and
he
would
have
him
either
you
best
go
down
to
the
gardener
said
he
you
best
fit
to
go
about
and
dig
in
the
garden
so
he
got
leave
to
be
with
the
gardener
but
none
of
the
other
servants
would
sleep
with
him
and
so
he
had
to
sleep
by
himself
under
the
steps
of
the
it
stood
upon
beams
and
had
a
high
staircase
under
that
he
got
some
turf
for
his
bed
and
there
he
lay
as
well
as
he
could
so
when
he
had
been
some
time
at
the
palace
it
happened
one
morning
just
as
the
sun
rose
that
the
lad
had
taken
off
his
wig
and
stood
and
washed
himself
and
then
he
was
so
handsome
it
was
a
joy
to
look
at
him
so
the
saw
from
her
window
the
lovely
gardener
boy
and
thought
she
had
never
seen
any
one
so
handsome
then
she
asked
the
gardener
why
he
lay
out
there
under
the
steps
oh
said
the
gardener
none
of
his
will
sleep
with
him
that
why
let
him
come
up
and
lie
at
the
door
inside
my
bedroom
and
then
they
not
refuse
to
sleep
with
him
any
more
said
the
so
the
gardener
told
that
to
the
lad
do
you
think
i
do
any
such
thing
said
the
lad
why
they
say
next
there
was
something
between
me
and
the
yes
said
the
gardener
you
good
reason
to
fear
any
such
thing
you
who
are
so
handsome
well
well
said
the
lad
since
it
her
will
i
suppose
i
must
go
so
when
he
was
to
go
up
the
steps
in
the
evening
he
tramped
and
stamped
so
on
the
way
that
they
had
to
beg
him
to
tread
softly
lest
the
should
come
to
know
it
so
he
came
into
the
bedroom
lay
down
and
began
to
snore
at
once
then
the
said
to
her
maid
go
gently
and
just
pull
his
wig
off
and
she
went
up
to
him
but
just
as
she
was
going
to
whisk
it
off
he
caught
hold
of
it
with
both
hands
and
said
she
should
never
have
it
after
that
he
lay
down
again
and
began
to
snore
then
the
gave
her
maid
a
wink
and
this
time
she
whisked
off
the
wig
and
there
lay
the
lad
so
lovely
and
white
and
red
just
as
the
had
seen
him
in
the
morning
sun
illustration
and
this
time
she
whisked
off
the
wig
and
there
lay
the
lad
so
lovely
and
white
and
red
just
as
the
princess
had
seen
him
in
the
morning
sun
after
that
the
lad
slept
every
night
in
the
bedroom
but
it
was
long
before
the
came
to
hear
how
the
lad
slept
every
night
in
the
bedroom
and
he
got
so
wroth
he
almost
took
the
lad
life
he
did
do
that
however
but
he
threw
him
into
the
prison
tower
and
as
for
his
daughter
he
shut
her
up
in
her
own
room
whence
she
never
got
leave
to
stir
day
or
night
all
that
she
begged
and
all
that
she
prayed
for
the
lad
and
herself
was
no
good
the
was
only
more
wroth
than
ever
some
time
after
came
a
war
and
uproar
in
the
land
and
the
had
to
take
up
arms
against
another
king
who
wished
to
take
the
kingdom
from
him
so
when
the
lad
heard
that
he
begged
the
gaoler
to
go
to
the
and
ask
for
a
coat
of
mail
and
a
sword
and
for
leave
to
go
to
the
war
all
the
rest
laughed
when
the
gaoler
told
his
errand
and
begged
the
to
let
him
have
an
old
suit
that
they
might
have
the
fun
of
seeing
such
a
wretch
in
battle
so
he
got
that
and
an
old
hack
besides
which
went
upon
three
legs
and
dragged
the
fourth
after
it
illustration
the
lad
in
the
battle
then
they
went
out
to
meet
the
foe
but
they
had
got
far
from
the
palace
before
the
lad
got
stuck
fast
in
a
bog
with
his
hack
there
he
sat
and
dug
his
spurs
in
and
cried
gee
up
gee
up
to
his
hack
and
all
the
rest
had
their
fun
out
of
this
and
laughed
and
made
game
of
the
lad
as
they
rode
past
him
but
they
were
scarcely
gone
before
he
ran
to
the
threw
on
his
coat
of
mail
and
shook
the
bridle
and
there
came
the
in
a
trice
and
said
do
now
your
best
and
i
do
mine
but
when
the
lad
came
up
the
battle
had
begun
and
the
was
in
a
sad
pinch
but
no
sooner
had
the
lad
rushed
into
the
thick
of
it
than
the
foe
was
beaten
back
and
put
to
flight
the
and
his
men
wondered
and
wondered
who
it
could
be
who
had
come
to
help
them
but
none
of
them
got
so
near
him
as
to
be
able
to
talk
to
him
and
as
soon
as
the
fight
was
over
he
was
gone
when
they
went
back
there
sat
the
lad
still
in
the
bog
and
dug
his
spurs
into
his
hack
and
they
all
laughed
again
no
only
just
look
they
said
there
the
fool
sits
still
the
next
day
when
they
went
out
to
battle
they
saw
the
lad
sitting
there
still
so
they
laughed
again
and
made
game
of
him
but
as
soon
as
ever
they
had
ridden
by
the
lad
ran
again
to
the
and
all
happened
as
on
the
first
day
every
one
wondered
what
strange
champion
it
could
be
that
had
helped
them
but
no
one
got
so
near
him
as
to
say
a
word
to
him
and
no
one
guessed
it
could
be
the
lad
that
easy
to
understand
so
when
they
went
home
at
night
and
saw
the
lad
still
sitting
there
on
his
hack
they
burst
out
laughing
at
him
again
and
one
of
them
shot
an
arrow
at
him
and
hit
him
in
the
leg
so
he
began
to
shriek
and
to
bewail
was
enough
to
break
one
heart
and
so
the
threw
his
to
him
to
bind
his
wound
when
they
went
out
to
battle
the
third
day
the
lad
still
sat
there
gee
up
gee
up
he
said
to
his
hack
nay
nay
said
the
men
if
he
wo
stick
there
till
starved
to
death
and
then
they
rode
on
and
laughed
at
him
till
they
were
fit
to
fall
from
their
horses
when
they
were
gone
he
ran
again
to
the
lime
and
came
up
to
the
battle
just
in
the
very
nick
of
time
this
day
he
slew
the
enemy
king
and
then
the
war
was
over
at
once
when
the
battle
was
over
the
caught
sight
of
his
handkerchief
which
the
strange
warrior
had
bound
round
his
leg
and
so
it
hard
to
find
him
out
so
they
took
him
with
great
joy
between
them
to
the
palace
and
the
who
saw
him
from
her
window
got
so
glad
no
one
can
believe
it
here
comes
my
own
true
love
she
said
then
he
took
the
pot
of
ointment
and
rubbed
himself
on
the
leg
and
after
that
he
rubbed
all
the
wounded
and
so
they
all
got
well
again
in
a
moment
so
he
got
the
to
wife
but
when
he
went
down
into
the
stable
where
his
horse
was
on
the
day
the
wedding
was
to
be
there
it
stood
so
dull
and
heavy
and
hung
its
ears
down
and
would
eat
its
corn
so
when
the
young
for
he
was
now
a
king
and
had
got
half
the
kingdom
spoke
to
him
and
asked
what
ailed
him
the
said
now
i
have
helped
you
on
and
now
i
wo
live
any
longer
so
just
take
the
sword
and
cut
my
head
off
no
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
the
young
but
you
shall
have
all
you
want
and
rest
all
your
life
well
said
the
if
you
do
do
as
i
tell
you
see
if
i
do
take
your
life
somehow
so
the
had
to
do
what
he
asked
but
when
he
swung
the
sword
and
was
to
cut
his
head
off
he
was
so
sorry
he
turned
away
his
face
for
he
would
not
see
the
stroke
fall
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
had
cut
off
the
head
there
stood
the
loveliest
on
the
spot
where
the
horse
had
stood
why
where
in
all
the
world
did
you
come
from
asked
the
it
was
i
who
was
a
horse
said
the
for
i
was
king
of
that
land
whose
king
you
slew

the
other
very
many
visits
the
three

on
a
time
there
were
three
who
were
to
go
up
to
the

and
the
name
of
all
three
was
on
the
way
up
was
a
bridge
over
a
burn
they
had
to
cross
and
under
the
bridge
lived
a
great
ugly
with
eyes
as
big
as
saucers
and
a
nose
as
long
as
a
poker
so
first
of
all
came
the
youngest
to
cross
the
bridge

that

and

under
him

over
my
bridge
roared
the

i
the
big

said
the
who
had
an
ugly

was
what
the
big
said
and
so
he
flew
at
the
and
poked
his
eyes
out
with
his
horns
and
crushed
him
to
bits
body
and
bones
and
tossed
him
out
into
the
burn
and
after
that
he
went
up
to
the
there
the
got
so
fat
they
were
scarce
able
to
walk
home
again
and
if
the
fat
has
fallen
off
them
why
they
still
fat
and
so
snip
snap
snout
this
tale
told
out
the
three
princesses
in
the
blue
mountain
there
were
once
upon
a
time
a
and
who
had
no
children
and
they
took
it
so
much
to
heart
that
they
hardly
ever
had
a
happy
moment
one
day
the
stood
in
the
portico
and
looked
out
over
the
big
meadows
and
all
that
was
his
but
he
felt
he
could
have
no
enjoyment
out
of
it
all
since
he
did
not
know
what
would
become
of
it
after
his
time
as
he
stood
there
pondering
an
old
beggar
woman
came
up
to
him
and
asked
him
for
a
trifle
in
heaven
name
she
greeted
him
and
curtsied
and
asked
what
ailed
the
since
he
looked
so
sad
you
ca
do
anything
to
help
me
my
good
woman
said
the
it
no
use
telling
you
i
am
not
so
sure
about
that
said
the
beggar
woman
very
little
is
wanted
when
luck
is
in
the
way
the
is
thinking
that
he
has
no
heir
to
his
crown
and
kingdom
but
he
need
not
mourn
on
that
account
she
said
the
shall
have
three
daughters
but
great
care
must
be
taken
that
they
do
not
come
out
under
the
open
heavens
before
they
are
all
fifteen
years
old
otherwise
a
snowdrift
will
come
and
carry
them
away
when
the
time
came
the
had
a
beautiful
baby
girl
the
year
after
she
had
another
and
the
third
year
she
also
had
a
girl
the
and
were
glad
beyond
all
measure
but
although
the
was
very
happy
he
did
not
forget
to
set
a
watch
at
the
palace
door
so
that
the
should
not
get
out
as
they
grew
up
they
became
both
fair
and
beautiful
and
all
went
well
with
them
in
every
way
their
only
sorrow
was
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
go
out
and
play
like
other
children
for
all
they
begged
and
prayed
their
parents
and
for
all
they
besought
the
sentinel
it
was
of
no
avail
go
out
they
must
not
before
they
were
fifteen
years
old
all
of
them
so
one
day
not
long
before
the
fifteenth
birthday
of
the
youngest
the
and
the
were
out
driving
and
the
were
standing
at
the
window
and
looking
out
the
sun
was
shining
and
everything
looked
so
green
and
beautiful
that
they
felt
that
they
must
go
out
happen
what
might
so
they
begged
and
entreated
and
urged
the
sentinel
all
three
of
them
that
he
should
let
them
down
into
the
garden
he
could
see
for
himself
how
warm
and
pleasant
it
was
no
snowy
weather
could
come
on
such
a
day
well
he
think
it
looked
much
like
it
either
and
if
they
must
go
they
had
better
go
the
soldier
said
but
it
must
only
be
for
a
minute
and
he
himself
would
go
with
them
and
look
after
them
when
they
got
down
into
the
garden
they
ran
up
and
down
and
filled
their
laps
with
flowers
and
green
leaves
the
prettiest
they
could
find
at
last
they
could
manage
no
more
but
just
as
they
were
going
indoors
they
caught
sight
of
a
large
rose
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
it
was
many
times
prettier
than
any
they
had
gathered
so
they
must
have
that
also
but
just
as
they
bent
down
to
take
the
rose
a
big
dense
snowdrift
came
and
carried
them
away
illustration
just
as
they
bent
down
to
take
the
rose
a
big
dense
came
and
carried
them
away
there
was
great
mourning
over
the
whole
country
and
the
made
known
from
all
the
churches
that
any
one
who
could
save
the
should
have
half
the
kingdom
and
his
golden
crown
and
whichever
princess
he
liked
to
choose
you
can
well
understand
there
were
plenty
who
wanted
to
gain
half
the
kingdom
and
a
princess
into
the
bargain
so
there
were
people
of
both
high
and
low
degree
who
set
out
for
all
parts
of
the
country
but
there
was
no
one
who
could
find
the
or
even
get
any
tidings
of
them
when
all
the
grand
and
rich
people
in
the
country
had
had
their
turn
a
captain
and
a
lieutenant
came
to
the
palace
and
wanted
to
try
their
luck
the
fitted
them
out
both
with
silver
and
gold
and
wished
them
success
on
their
journey
then
came
a
soldier
who
lived
with
his
mother
in
a
little
cottage
some
way
from
the
palace
he
had
dreamt
one
night
that
he
also
was
trying
to
find
the
when
the
morning
came
he
still
remembered
what
he
had
dreamt
and
told
his
mother
about
it
some
witchery
must
have
got
hold
of
you
said
the
woman
but
you
must
dream
the
same
thing
three
nights
running
else
there
is
nothing
in
it
and
the
next
two
nights
the
same
thing
happened
he
had
the
same
dream
and
he
felt
he
must
go
so
he
washed
himself
and
put
on
his
uniform
and
went
into
the
kitchen
at
the
palace
it
was
the
day
after
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
had
set
out
you
had
better
go
home
again
said
the
the
are
beyond
your
reach
i
should
say
and
besides
i
have
spent
so
much
money
on
outfits
that
i
have
nothing
left
you
had
better
come
back
another
time
if
i
go
i
must
go
said
the
soldier
money
i
do
not
want
i
only
need
a
drop
in
my
flask
and
some
food
in
my
wallet
he
said
but
it
must
be
a
good
walletful
as
much
meat
and
bacon
as
i
can
carry
yes
that
he
might
have
if
that
was
all
he
wanted
so
he
set
off
and
he
had
not
gone
many
miles
before
he
overtook
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
where
are
you
going
asked
the
captain
when
he
saw
the
man
in
uniform
i
going
to
try
if
i
can
find
the
answered
the
soldier
so
are
we
said
the
captain
and
since
your
errand
is
the
same
you
may
keep
company
with
us
for
if
we
do
find
them
you
are
not
likely
to
find
them
either
my
lad
said
he
when
they
had
gone
awhile
the
soldier
left
the
high
road
and
took
a
path
into
the
forest
where
are
you
going
said
the
captain
it
is
best
to
follow
the
high
road
that
may
be
said
the
soldier
but
this
is
my
way
he
kept
to
the
path
and
when
the
others
saw
this
they
turned
round
and
followed
him
away
they
went
further
and
further
far
across
big
moors
and
along
narrow
valleys
and
at
last
it
became
lighter
and
when
they
had
got
out
of
the
forest
altogether
they
came
to
a
long
bridge
which
they
had
to
cross
but
on
that
bridge
a
bear
stood
on
guard
he
rose
on
his
hind
legs
and
came
towards
them
as
if
he
wanted
to
eat
them
what
shall
we
do
now
said
the
captain
they
say
that
the
bear
is
fond
of
meat
said
the
soldier
and
then
he
threw
a
fore
quarter
to
him
and
so
they
got
past
but
when
they
reached
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
they
saw
a
lion
which
came
roaring
towards
them
with
open
jaws
as
if
he
wanted
to
swallow
them
i
think
we
had
better
turn
we
shall
never
be
able
to
get
past
him
alive
said
the
captain
oh
i
do
think
he
is
so
very
dangerous
said
the
soldier
i
have
heard
that
lions
are
very
fond
of
bacon
and
i
have
half
a
pig
in
my
wallet
and
then
he
threw
a
ham
to
the
lion
who
began
eating
and
gnawing
and
thus
they
got
past
him
also
in
the
evening
they
came
to
a
fine
big
house
each
room
was
more
gorgeous
than
the
other
all
was
glitter
and
splendour
wherever
they
looked
but
that
did
not
satisfy
their
hunger
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
went
round
rattling
their
money
and
wanted
to
buy
some
food
but
they
saw
no
people
nor
could
they
find
a
crumb
of
anything
in
the
house
so
the
soldier
offered
them
some
food
from
his
wallet
which
they
were
not
too
proud
to
accept
nor
did
they
want
any
pressing
they
helped
themselves
of
what
he
had
as
if
they
had
never
tasted
food
before
the
next
day
the
captain
said
they
would
have
to
go
out
shooting
and
try
to
get
something
to
live
upon
close
to
the
house
was
a
large
forest
where
there
were
plenty
of
hares
and
birds
the
lieutenant
was
to
remain
at
home
and
cook
the
remainder
of
the
food
in
the
wallet
in
the
meantime
the
captain
and
the
soldier
shot
so
much
game
that
they
were
hardly
able
to
carry
it
home
when
they
came
to
the
door
they
found
the
lieutenant
in
such
a
terrible
plight
that
he
was
scarcely
able
to
open
the
door
to
them
what
is
the
matter
with
you
said
the
captain
the
lieutenant
then
told
them
that
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
a
tiny
little
man
with
a
long
beard
who
went
on
crutches
came
in
and
asked
so
plaintively
for
a
penny
but
no
sooner
had
he
got
it
than
he
let
it
fall
on
the
floor
and
for
all
he
raked
and
scraped
with
his
crutch
he
was
not
able
to
get
hold
of
it
so
stiff
and
stark
was
he
i
pitied
the
poor
old
body
said
the
lieutenant
and
so
i
bent
down
to
pick
up
the
penny
but
then
he
was
neither
stiff
nor
stark
any
longer
he
began
to
belabour
me
with
his
crutches
till
very
soon
i
was
unable
to
move
a
limb
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
you
one
of
the
king
officers
to
let
an
old
cripple
give
you
a
thrashing
and
then
tell
people
of
it
into
the
bargain
said
the
captain
pshaw
i
stop
at
home
and
then
you
hear
another
story
the
next
day
the
lieutenant
and
the
soldier
went
out
shooting
and
the
captain
remained
at
home
to
do
the
cooking
and
look
after
the
house
but
if
he
fared
no
worse
he
certainly
fared
no
better
than
the
lieutenant
in
a
little
while
the
old
man
came
in
and
asked
for
a
penny
he
let
it
fall
as
soon
as
he
got
it
gone
it
was
and
could
not
be
found
so
he
asked
the
captain
to
help
him
to
find
it
and
the
captain
without
giving
a
thought
bent
down
to
look
for
it
but
no
sooner
was
he
on
his
knees
than
the
cripple
began
belabouring
him
with
his
crutches
and
every
time
the
captain
tried
to
rise
he
got
a
blow
which
sent
him
reeling
when
the
others
came
home
in
the
evening
he
still
lay
on
the
same
spot
and
could
neither
see
nor
speak
the
third
day
the
soldier
was
to
remain
at
home
while
the
other
two
went
out
shooting
the
captain
said
he
must
take
care
of
himself
for
the
old
fellow
will
soon
put
an
end
to
you
my
lad
said
he
oh
there
ca
be
much
life
in
one
if
such
an
old
crook
can
take
it
said
the
soldier
they
were
no
sooner
outside
the
door
than
the
old
man
came
in
and
asked
for
a
penny
again
money
i
have
never
owned
said
the
soldier
but
food
i
give
you
as
soon
as
it
is
ready
said
he
but
if
we
are
to
get
it
cooked
you
must
go
and
cut
the
wood
that
i
ca
said
the
old
man
if
you
ca
you
must
learn
said
the
soldier
i
will
soon
show
you
come
along
with
me
down
to
the
there
he
dragged
out
a
heavy
log
and
cut
a
cleft
in
it
and
drove
in
a
wedge
till
the
cleft
deepened
now
you
must
lie
down
and
look
right
along
the
cleft
and
you
soon
learn
how
to
cut
wood
said
the
soldier
in
the
meantime
i
show
you
how
to
use
the
axe
the
old
man
was
not
sufficiently
cunning
and
did
as
he
was
told
he
lay
down
and
looked
steadily
along
the
log
when
the
soldier
saw
the
old
man
beard
had
got
well
into
the
cleft
he
struck
out
the
wedge
the
cleft
closed
and
the
old
man
was
caught
by
the
beard
the
soldier
began
to
beat
him
with
the
axe
handle
and
then
swung
the
axe
round
his
head
and
vowed
that
he
would
split
his
skull
if
he
did
not
tell
him
there
and
then
where
the
were
spare
my
life
spare
my
life
and
i
tell
you
said
the
old
man
to
the
east
of
the
house
there
is
a
big
mound
on
top
of
the
mound
you
must
dig
out
a
square
piece
of
turf
and
then
you
will
see
a
big
stone
slab
under
that
there
is
a
deep
hole
through
which
you
must
let
yourself
down
and
you
then
come
to
another
world
where
you
will
find
the
but
the
way
is
long
and
dark
and
it
goes
both
through
fire
and
water
when
the
soldier
got
to
know
this
he
released
the
old
man
who
was
not
long
in
making
off
when
the
captain
and
lieutenant
came
home
they
were
surprised
to
find
the
soldier
alive
he
told
them
what
had
happened
from
first
to
last
where
the
were
and
how
they
should
find
them
they
became
as
pleased
as
if
they
had
already
found
them
and
when
they
had
had
some
food
they
took
with
them
a
basket
and
as
much
rope
as
they
could
find
and
all
three
set
off
to
the
mound
there
they
first
dug
out
the
turf
just
as
the
old
man
had
told
them
and
underneath
they
found
a
big
stone
slab
which
it
took
all
their
strength
to
turn
over
they
then
began
to
measure
how
deep
it
was
they
joined
on
ropes
both
two
and
three
times
but
they
were
no
nearer
the
bottom
the
last
time
than
the
first
at
last
they
had
to
join
all
the
ropes
they
had
both
the
coarse
and
fine
and
then
they
found
it
reached
the
bottom
the
captain
was
of
course
the
first
who
wanted
to
descend
but
when
i
tug
at
the
rope
you
must
make
haste
to
drag
me
up
again
he
said
he
found
the
way
both
dark
and
unpleasant
but
he
thought
he
would
go
on
as
long
as
it
became
no
worse
but
all
at
once
he
felt
ice
cold
water
spouting
about
his
ears
he
became
frightened
to
death
and
began
tugging
at
the
rope
the
lieutenant
was
the
next
to
try
but
it
fared
no
better
with
him
no
sooner
had
he
got
through
the
flood
of
water
than
he
saw
a
blazing
fire
yawning
beneath
him
which
so
frightened
him
that
he
also
turned
back
the
soldier
then
got
into
the
bucket
and
down
he
went
through
fire
and
water
right
on
till
he
came
to
the
bottom
where
it
was
so
pitch
dark
that
he
could
not
see
his
hand
before
him
he
dared
not
let
go
the
basket
but
went
round
in
a
circle
feeling
and
fumbling
about
him
at
last
he
discovered
a
gleam
of
light
far
far
away
like
the
dawn
of
day
and
he
went
on
in
that
direction
when
he
had
gone
a
bit
it
began
to
grow
light
around
him
and
before
long
he
saw
a
golden
sun
rising
in
the
sky
and
everything
around
him
became
as
bright
and
beautiful
as
if
in
a
fairy
world
first
he
came
to
some
cattle
which
were
so
fat
that
their
hides
glistened
a
long
way
off
and
when
he
had
got
past
them
he
came
to
a
fine
big
palace
he
walked
through
many
rooms
without
meeting
anybody
at
last
he
heard
the
hum
of
a
spinning
wheel
and
when
he
entered
the
room
he
found
the
eldest
sitting
there
spinning
copper
yarn
the
room
and
everything
in
it
was
of
brightly
polished
copper
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
are
christian
people
doing
here
said
the
heaven
preserve
you
what
do
you
want
i
want
to
set
you
free
and
get
you
out
of
the
mountain
said
the
soldier
pray
do
not
stay
if
the
troll
comes
home
he
will
put
an
end
to
you
at
once
he
has
three
heads
said
she
i
do
not
care
if
he
has
four
said
the
soldier
i
am
here
and
here
i
shall
remain
well
if
you
will
be
so
headstrong
i
must
see
if
i
can
help
you
said
the
she
then
told
him
to
creep
behind
the
big
brewing
vat
which
stood
in
the
front
hall
meanwhile
she
would
receive
the
troll
and
scratch
his
heads
till
he
went
to
sleep
and
when
i
go
out
and
call
the
hens
you
must
make
haste
and
come
in
she
said
but
you
must
first
try
if
you
can
swing
the
sword
which
is
lying
on
the
table
no
it
was
too
heavy
he
could
not
even
move
it
he
had
then
to
take
a
strengthening
draught
from
the
horn
which
hung
behind
the
door
after
that
he
was
just
able
to
stir
it
so
he
took
another
draught
and
then
he
could
lift
it
at
last
he
took
a
right
big
draught
and
he
could
swing
the
sword
as
easily
as
anything
all
at
once
the
troll
came
home
he
walked
so
heavily
that
the
palace
shook
ugh
ugh
i
smell
christian
flesh
and
blood
in
my
house
said
he
yes
answered
the
a
raven
flew
past
here
just
now
and
in
his
beak
he
had
a
human
bone
which
he
dropped
down
the
chimney
i
threw
it
out
and
swept
and
cleaned
up
after
it
but
i
suppose
it
still
smells
so
it
does
said
the
troll
but
come
and
lie
down
and
i
scratch
your
heads
said
the
the
smell
will
be
gone
by
the
time
you
wake
illustration
the
troll
was
quite
willing
and
before
long
he
fell
asleep
and
began
snoring
the
troll
was
quite
willing
and
before
long
he
fell
asleep
and
began
snoring
when
she
saw
he
was
sleeping
soundly
she
placed
some
stools
and
cushions
under
his
heads
and
went
to
call
the
hens
the
soldier
then
stole
into
the
room
with
the
sword
and
with
one
blow
cut
all
the
three
heads
off
the
troll
the
was
as
pleased
as
a
fiddler
and
went
with
the
soldier
to
her
sisters
so
that
he
could
also
set
them
free
first
of
all
they
went
across
a
courtyard
and
then
through
many
long
rooms
till
they
came
to
a
big
door
here
you
must
enter
here
she
is
said
the
when
he
opened
the
door
he
found
himself
in
a
large
hall
where
everything
was
of
pure
silver
there
sat
the
second
sister
at
a
silver
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
said
what
do
you
want
here
i
want
to
set
you
free
from
the
troll
said
the
soldier
pray
do
not
stay
but
go
said
the
if
he
finds
you
here
he
will
take
your
life
on
the
spot
that
would
be
awkward
that
is
if
i
do
take
his
first
said
the
soldier
well
since
you
will
stay
she
said
you
will
have
to
creep
behind
the
big
in
the
front
hall
but
you
must
make
haste
and
come
as
soon
as
you
hear
me
calling
the
hens
first
of
all
he
had
to
try
if
he
was
able
to
swing
the
troll
sword
which
lay
on
the
table
it
was
much
larger
and
heavier
than
the
first
one
he
was
hardly
able
to
move
it
he
then
took
three
draughts
from
the
horn
and
he
could
then
lift
it
and
when
he
had
taken
three
more
he
could
handle
it
as
if
it
were
a
rolling
pin
shortly
afterwards
he
heard
a
heavy
rumbling
noise
that
was
quite
terrible
and
directly
afterwards
a
troll
with
six
heads
came
in
ugh
ugh
he
said
as
soon
as
he
got
his
noses
inside
the
door
i
smell
christian
blood
and
bone
in
my
house
yes
just
think
a
raven
came
flying
past
here
with
a
which
he
dropped
down
the
chimney
said
the
i
threw
it
out
but
the
raven
brought
it
back
again
at
last
i
got
rid
of
it
and
made
haste
to
clean
the
room
but
i
suppose
the
smell
is
not
quite
gone
she
said
no
i
can
smell
it
well
said
the
troll
but
he
was
tired
and
put
his
heads
in
the
lap
and
she
went
on
scratching
them
till
they
all
fell
then
she
called
the
hens
and
the
soldier
came
and
cut
off
all
the
six
heads
as
if
they
were
set
on
cabbage
stalks
she
was
no
less
glad
than
her
elder
sister
as
you
may
imagine
and
danced
and
sang
but
in
the
midst
of
their
joy
they
remembered
their
youngest
sister
they
went
with
the
soldier
across
a
large
courtyard
and
after
walking
through
many
many
rooms
he
came
to
the
hall
of
gold
where
the
third
sister
was
she
sat
at
a
golden
spinning
gold
yarn
and
the
room
from
ceiling
to
floor
glistened
and
glittered
till
it
hurt
eyes
heaven
preserve
both
you
and
me
what
do
you
want
here
said
the
go
go
else
the
troll
will
kill
us
both
just
as
well
two
as
one
answered
the
soldier
the
cried
and
wept
but
it
was
all
of
no
use
he
must
and
would
remain
since
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
would
have
to
try
if
he
could
use
the
troll
sword
on
the
table
in
the
front
hall
but
he
was
only
just
able
to
move
it
it
was
still
larger
and
heavier
than
the
other
two
swords
he
then
had
to
take
the
horn
down
from
the
wall
and
take
three
draughts
from
it
but
was
only
just
able
to
stir
the
sword
when
he
had
taken
three
more
draughts
he
could
lift
it
and
when
he
had
taken
another
three
he
swung
it
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
a
feather
the
then
settled
with
the
soldier
to
do
the
same
as
her
sisters
had
done
as
soon
as
the
troll
was
well
asleep
she
would
call
the
hens
and
he
must
then
make
haste
and
come
in
and
put
an
end
to
the
troll
all
of
a
sudden
they
heard
such
a
thundering
rambling
noise
as
if
the
walls
and
roof
were
tumbling
in
ugh
ugh
i
smell
christian
blood
and
bone
in
my
house
said
the
troll
sniffing
with
all
his
nine
noses
yes
you
never
saw
the
like
just
now
a
raven
flew
past
here
and
dropped
a
human
bone
down
the
chimney
i
threw
it
out
but
the
raven
brought
it
back
and
this
went
on
for
some
time
said
the
but
she
got
it
buried
at
last
she
said
and
she
had
both
swept
and
cleaned
the
place
but
she
supposed
it
still
smelt
yes
i
can
smell
it
well
said
the
troll
come
here
and
lie
down
in
my
lap
and
i
will
scratch
your
heads
said
the
the
smell
will
be
all
gone
when
you
awake
he
did
so
and
when
he
was
snoring
at
his
best
she
put
stools
and
cushions
under
the
heads
so
that
she
could
get
away
to
call
the
hens
the
soldier
then
came
in
in
his
stockinged
feet
and
struck
at
the
troll
so
that
eight
of
the
heads
fell
off
at
one
blow
but
the
sword
was
too
short
and
did
not
reach
far
enough
the
ninth
head
woke
up
and
began
to
roar
ugh
ugh
i
smell
a
christian
yes
here
he
is
answered
the
soldier
and
before
the
troll
could
get
up
and
seize
hold
of
him
the
soldier
struck
him
another
blow
and
the
last
head
rolled
along
the
floor
you
can
well
imagine
how
glad
the
became
now
that
they
no
longer
had
to
sit
and
scratch
the
trolls
heads
they
did
not
know
how
they
could
do
enough
for
him
who
had
saved
them
the
youngest
took
off
her
gold
ring
and
knotted
it
in
his
hair
they
then
took
with
them
as
much
gold
and
silver
as
they
thought
they
could
carry
and
set
off
on
their
way
home
illustration
as
soon
as
they
tugged
at
the
rope
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
pulled
up
the
princesses
the
one
after
the
other
as
soon
as
they
tugged
at
the
rope
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
pulled
up
the
the
one
after
the
other
but
when
they
were
safely
up
the
soldier
thought
it
was
foolish
of
him
not
to
have
gone
up
before
the
for
he
had
not
very
much
belief
in
his
comrades
he
thought
he
would
first
try
them
so
he
put
a
heavy
lump
of
gold
in
the
basket
and
got
out
of
the
way
when
the
basket
was
up
they
cut
the
rope
and
the
lump
of
gold
fell
to
the
bottom
with
such
a
crash
that
the
pieces
flew
about
his
ears
now
we
are
rid
of
him
they
said
and
threatened
the
with
their
life
if
they
did
not
say
that
it
was
they
who
had
saved
them
from
the
trolls
they
were
forced
to
agree
to
this
much
against
their
will
and
especially
the
youngest
but
life
was
precious
and
so
the
two
who
were
strongest
had
their
way
when
the
captain
and
lieutenant
got
home
with
the
you
may
be
sure
there
were
great
rejoicings
at
the
palace
the
was
so
glad
he
did
know
which
leg
to
stand
on
he
brought
out
his
best
wine
from
his
cupboard
and
wished
the
two
officers
welcome
if
they
had
never
been
honoured
before
they
were
honoured
now
in
full
measure
and
no
mistake
they
walked
and
strutted
about
the
whole
of
the
day
as
if
they
were
the
cocks
of
the
walk
since
they
were
now
going
to
have
the
for
for
it
was
understood
they
should
each
have
whichever
of
the
they
liked
and
half
the
kingdom
between
them
they
both
wanted
the
youngest
but
for
all
they
prayed
and
threatened
her
it
was
of
no
use
she
would
not
hear
or
listen
to
either
they
then
asked
the
if
they
might
have
twelve
men
to
watch
over
her
she
was
so
sad
and
melancholy
since
she
had
been
in
the
mountain
that
they
were
afraid
she
might
do
something
to
herself
yes
that
they
might
have
and
the
himself
told
the
watch
they
must
look
well
after
her
and
follow
her
wherever
she
went
and
stood
they
then
began
to
prepare
for
the
wedding
of
the
two
eldest
sisters
it
should
be
such
a
wedding
as
never
was
heard
or
spoken
of
before
and
there
was
no
end
to
the
brewing
and
the
baking
and
the
slaughtering
in
the
meantime
the
soldier
walked
and
strolled
about
down
in
the
other
world
he
thought
it
was
hard
that
he
should
see
neither
people
nor
daylight
any
more
but
he
would
have
to
do
something
he
thought
and
so
for
many
days
he
went
about
from
room
to
room
and
opened
all
the
drawers
and
cupboards
and
searched
about
on
the
shelves
and
looked
at
all
the
fine
things
that
were
there
at
last
he
came
to
a
drawer
in
a
table
in
which
there
lay
a
golden
key
he
tried
this
key
to
all
the
locks
he
could
find
but
there
was
none
it
fitted
till
he
came
to
a
little
cupboard
over
the
bed
and
in
that
he
found
an
old
rusty
whistle
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
sound
in
it
he
thought
and
put
it
to
his
mouth
no
sooner
had
he
whistled
than
he
heard
a
whizzing
and
a
whirring
from
all
quarters
and
such
a
large
flock
of
birds
swept
down
that
they
blackened
all
the
field
in
which
they
settled
illustration
no
sooner
had
he
whistled
than
he
heard
a
whizzing
and
a
whirring
from
all
quarters
and
such
a
large
flock
of
birds
swept
down
that
they
blackened
all
the
field
in
which
they
settled
what
does
our
master
want
they
asked
if
he
were
their
master
the
soldier
said
he
would
like
to
know
if
they
could
tell
him
how
to
get
up
to
the
earth
again
no
none
of
them
knew
anything
about
that
but
our
mother
has
not
yet
arrived
they
said
if
she
ca
help
you
no
one
can
so
he
whistled
once
more
and
shortly
heard
something
flapping
its
wings
far
away
and
then
it
began
to
blow
so
hard
that
he
was
carried
away
between
the
houses
like
a
wisp
of
hay
across
the
courtyard
and
if
he
had
not
caught
hold
of
the
fence
he
would
no
doubt
have
been
blown
away
altogether
a
big
eagle
bigger
than
you
can
imagine
then
swooped
down
in
front
of
him
you
come
rather
sharply
said
the
soldier
as
you
whistle
so
i
come
answered
the
eagle
so
he
asked
her
if
she
knew
any
means
by
which
he
could
get
away
from
the
world
in
which
they
were
you
ca
get
away
from
here
unless
you
can
fly
said
the
eagle
but
if
you
will
slaughter
twelve
oxen
for
me
so
that
i
can
have
a
really
good
meal
i
will
try
and
help
you
have
you
got
a
knife
no
but
i
have
a
sword
he
said
when
the
eagle
had
swallowed
the
twelve
oxen
she
asked
the
soldier
to
kill
one
more
for
victuals
on
the
journey
every
time
i
gape
you
must
be
quick
and
fling
a
piece
into
my
mouth
she
said
else
i
shall
not
be
able
to
carry
you
up
to
earth
he
did
as
she
asked
him
and
hung
two
large
bags
of
meat
round
her
neck
and
seated
himself
among
her
feathers
the
eagle
then
began
to
flap
her
wings
and
off
they
went
through
the
air
like
the
wind
it
was
as
much
as
the
soldier
could
do
to
hold
on
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
he
managed
to
throw
the
pieces
of
flesh
into
the
mouth
every
time
she
opened
it
at
last
the
day
began
to
dawn
and
the
eagle
was
then
almost
exhausted
and
began
flapping
with
her
wings
but
the
soldier
was
prepared
and
seized
the
last
hind
quarter
and
flung
it
to
her
then
she
gained
strength
and
brought
him
up
to
earth
when
she
had
sat
and
rested
a
while
at
the
top
of
a
large
she
set
off
with
him
again
at
such
a
pace
that
flashes
of
lightning
were
seen
both
by
sea
and
land
wherever
they
went
close
to
the
palace
the
soldier
got
off
and
the
eagle
flew
home
again
but
first
she
told
him
that
if
he
at
any
time
should
want
her
he
need
only
blow
the
whistle
and
she
would
be
there
at
once
in
the
meantime
everything
was
ready
at
the
palace
and
the
time
approached
when
the
captain
and
lieutenant
were
to
be
married
with
the
two
eldest
who
however
were
not
much
happier
than
their
youngest
sister
scarcely
a
day
passed
without
weeping
and
mourning
and
the
nearer
the
approached
the
more
sorrowful
did
they
become
at
last
the
asked
what
was
the
matter
with
them
he
thought
it
was
very
strange
that
they
were
not
merry
and
happy
now
that
they
were
saved
and
had
been
set
free
and
were
going
to
be
married
they
had
to
give
some
answer
and
so
the
eldest
sister
said
they
never
would
be
happy
any
more
unless
they
could
get
such
checkers
as
they
had
played
with
in
the
blue
mountain
that
thought
the
could
be
easily
managed
and
so
he
sent
word
to
all
the
best
and
cleverest
goldsmiths
in
the
country
that
they
should
make
these
checkers
for
the
for
all
they
tried
there
was
no
one
who
could
make
them
at
last
all
the
goldsmiths
had
been
to
the
palace
except
one
and
he
was
an
old
infirm
man
who
had
not
done
any
work
for
many
years
except
odd
jobs
by
which
he
was
just
able
to
keep
himself
alive
to
him
the
soldier
went
and
asked
to
be
apprenticed
the
old
man
was
so
glad
to
get
him
for
he
had
not
had
an
apprentice
for
many
a
day
that
he
brought
out
a
flask
from
his
chest
and
sat
down
to
drink
with
the
soldier
before
long
the
drink
got
into
his
head
and
when
the
soldier
saw
this
he
persuaded
him
to
go
up
to
the
palace
and
tell
the
that
he
would
undertake
to
make
the
checkers
for
the
he
was
ready
to
do
that
on
the
spot
he
had
made
finer
and
grander
things
in
his
day
he
said
when
the
heard
there
was
some
one
outside
who
could
make
the
checkers
he
was
not
long
in
coming
out
is
it
true
what
you
say
that
you
can
make
such
checkers
as
my
daughters
want
he
asked
yes
it
is
no
lie
said
the
goldsmith
that
he
would
answer
for
that
well
said
the
here
is
the
gold
to
make
them
with
but
if
you
do
not
succeed
you
will
lose
your
life
since
you
have
come
and
offered
yourself
and
they
must
be
finished
in
three
days
the
next
morning
when
the
goldsmith
had
slept
off
the
effects
of
the
drink
he
was
not
quite
so
confident
about
the
job
he
wailed
and
wept
and
blew
up
his
apprentice
who
had
got
him
into
such
a
scrape
while
he
was
drunk
the
best
thing
would
be
to
make
short
work
of
himself
at
once
he
said
for
there
could
be
no
hope
for
his
life
when
the
best
and
grandest
goldsmiths
could
not
make
such
checkers
was
it
likely
that
he
could
do
it
do
fret
on
that
account
said
the
soldier
but
let
me
have
the
gold
and
i
get
the
checkers
ready
in
time
but
i
must
have
a
room
to
myself
to
work
in
he
said
this
he
got
and
thanks
into
the
bargain
the
time
wore
on
and
the
soldier
did
nothing
but
lounge
about
and
the
goldsmith
began
to
grumble
because
he
would
not
begin
with
the
work
do
worry
yourself
about
it
said
the
soldier
there
is
plenty
of
time
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
what
i
have
promised
you
had
better
make
them
yourself
the
same
thing
went
on
both
that
day
and
the
next
and
when
the
smith
heard
neither
hammer
nor
file
from
the
soldier
room
the
whole
of
the
last
day
he
quite
gave
himself
up
for
lost
it
was
now
no
use
to
think
any
longer
about
saving
his
life
he
thought
but
when
the
night
came
on
the
soldier
opened
the
window
and
blew
his
whistle
the
eagle
then
came
and
asked
what
he
wanted
those
gold
checkers
which
the
had
in
the
blue
mountain
said
the
soldier
but
you
want
something
to
eat
first
i
suppose
i
have
two
ox
carcases
lying
ready
for
you
in
the
yonder
you
had
better
finish
them
he
said
when
the
eagle
had
done
she
did
not
tarry
and
long
before
the
sun
rose
she
was
back
again
with
the
checkers
the
soldier
then
put
them
under
his
bed
and
lay
down
to
sleep
early
next
morning
the
goldsmith
came
and
knocked
at
his
door
what
are
you
after
now
again
asked
the
soldier
you
rush
about
enough
in
the
day
goodness
knows
if
one
can
not
have
peace
when
one
is
in
bed
whoever
would
be
an
apprentice
here
said
he
neither
praying
nor
begging
helped
that
time
the
goldsmith
must
and
would
come
in
and
at
last
he
was
let
in
and
then
you
may
be
sure
there
was
soon
an
end
to
his
wailing
but
still
more
glad
than
the
goldsmith
were
the
when
he
came
up
to
the
palace
with
the
checkers
and
gladdest
of
all
was
the
youngest
have
you
made
them
yourself
she
asked
no
if
i
must
speak
the
truth
it
is
not
i
he
said
but
my
apprentice
who
has
made
them
i
should
like
to
see
that
apprentice
said
the
in
fact
all
three
wanted
to
see
him
and
if
he
valued
his
life
he
would
have
to
come
he
was
not
afraid
either
of
or
said
the
soldier
and
if
it
could
be
any
amusement
to
them
to
look
at
his
rags
they
should
soon
have
that
pleasure
the
youngest
recognised
him
at
once
she
pushed
the
soldiers
aside
and
ran
up
to
him
gave
him
her
hand
and
said
good
day
and
many
thanks
for
all
you
have
done
for
us
it
is
he
who
freed
us
from
the
trolls
in
the
mountain
she
said
to
the
he
is
the
one
i
will
have
and
then
she
pulled
off
his
cap
and
showed
them
the
ring
she
had
tied
in
his
hair
it
soon
came
out
how
the
captain
and
lieutenant
had
behaved
and
so
they
had
to
pay
the
penalty
of
their
treachery
with
their
lives
and
that
was
the
end
of
their
grandeur
but
the
soldier
got
the
golden
crown
and
half
the
kingdom
and
married
the
youngest
at
the
wedding
they
drank
and
feasted
both
well
and
long
for
feast
they
all
could
even
if
they
could
not
find
the
and
if
they
have
not
yet
done
feasting
and
drinking
they
must
be
at
it
still
the
cat
on
the
dovrefell
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
man
up
in
finnmark
who
had
caught
a
great
white
bear
which
he
was
going
to
take
to
the
king
of
denmark
now
it
so
fell
out
that
he
came
to
the
just
about
christmas
eve
and
there
he
turned
into
a
cottage
where
a
man
lived
whose
name
was
halvor
and
asked
the
man
if
he
could
get
there
for
his
bear
and
himself
heaven
never
help
me
if
what
i
say
is
true
said
the
man
but
we
ca
give
anyone
just
now
for
every
christmas
eve
such
a
pack
of
come
down
upon
us
that
we
are
forced
to
flit
and
have
so
much
as
a
house
over
our
own
heads
to
say
nothing
of
lending
one
to
anyone
else
oh
said
the
man
if
that
all
you
can
very
well
lend
me
your
house
my
bear
can
lie
under
the
stove
yonder
and
i
can
sleep
in
the
well
he
begged
so
hard
that
at
last
he
got
leave
to
stay
there
so
the
people
of
the
house
flitted
out
and
before
they
went
everything
was
got
ready
for
the
the
tables
were
laid
and
there
was
rice
porridge
and
fish
boiled
in
lye
and
sausages
and
all
else
that
was
good
just
as
for
any
other
grand
feast
so
when
everything
was
ready
down
came
the
some
were
great
and
some
were
small
some
had
long
tails
and
some
had
no
tails
at
all
some
too
had
long
long
noses
and
they
ate
and
drank
and
tasted
everything
just
then
one
of
the
little
caught
sight
of
the
white
bear
who
lay
under
the
stove
so
he
took
a
piece
of
sausage
and
stuck
it
on
a
fork
and
went
and
poked
it
up
against
the
bear
nose
screaming
out
pussy
will
you
have
some
sausage
then
the
white
bear
rose
up
and
growled
and
hunted
the
whole
pack
of
them
out
of
doors
both
great
and
small
next
year
halvor
was
out
in
the
wood
on
the
afternoon
of
christmas
eve
cutting
wood
before
the
holidays
for
he
thought
the
would
come
again
and
just
as
he
was
hard
at
work
he
heard
a
voice
in
the
wood
calling
out
halvor
halvor
well
said
halvor
