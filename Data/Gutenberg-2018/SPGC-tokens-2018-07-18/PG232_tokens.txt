none

line
you
draw
when

may
tally

whenas

earth
flickers

wavers
so
let
all
be
ranged
in
equal
rows
symmetric
not

an
idle
fancy
with
the

since
not
otherwise
will
earth
afford
vigour
to
all

shouldst
haply
of

inquire
even

i

fixed
the

which
howso
far
its

soars

so
deep
strikes

it
therefore
neither

wrench
from

bed
unshaken
it
abides
sees
many
a
generation
many
an
age
of

roll
onward

survives
them
all
stretching
its

slope

neither
take
the
topmost
shoots
for

their

of

nor

the

with
blunted
blade
nor
truncheons
intersperse
of
the

olive
for
oft
from
careless
swains
a
spark
hath
fallen
that
the
unctuous
rind
hid
first
now
grips
the
tough

mounting
to
the
leaves
on

sends
forth
a
roar
to

then
coursing
through
the
boughs
and
airy
summits
reigns
victoriously
wraps
all
the
grove
in
robes
of
fire
and
gross
with
vapour
heaves
the
murky
reek
skyward
but
chiefly
if
a
storm
has
swooped
down
on
the
forest
and
a
driving
wind
rolls
up
the
conflagration
when
is
so

them
nor
when
lopped
away

they
recover

thus
alone
survives
the

with
its
bitter
leaves
let
none

water
trickle

creep

the

their

raise

with

then

they
have
hied
them
for

king

with
uproar
dire
fierce
feud
arises
and
at

from

you
may
discern
what

sways
the

and
how
their

are
throbbing
for
the
strife
hark
the
hoarse
brazen
note
that
warriors
know
chides
on
the
loiterers
and
the
ear
may
catch
a
sound
that
mocks
the
broken
blasts
then
in
hot
haste
they
muster
then
flash
wings
sharpen
their
pointed
beaks
and
knit
their
thews
and
round
the
king
even
to
his
royal
tent
throng
rallying
and
with
shouts
defy
the
foe
so
when
a
dry
spring
and
clear
space
is
given
forth
from
the
gates
they
burst
they
clash
on
high
a
din
arises
they
are
heaped
and
rolled
into
one
mighty
mass
and
headlong
fall
not
denselier
hail
through
heaven
nor
pelting
so
rains
from
the
shaken
oak
its
conspicuous

the

themselves
press
through
the

of

display
a

not

they
fare
when

wherewith
they
poise
them
through

this

of

by

will
move
thy
wonder
that
nor

yoke
they
in

nor
yield
their

to

nor
know
the

of

alone
from

gather
their

new

thy

here
by
the
brink
of
the
peneian
sire
stands
woebegone
and
weeping
and
by

cries
out
upon
thee
for
thy
cruelty
to

tread
the
threshold

so
saying
she
bids
the
flood
yawn
wide
and
yield
a
pathway
for
his
footsteps
but
the
wave
arched
closed
round
him
and
within
its
mighty
bosom
welcomed
and
let
speed
to
the
deep
and
now
with
eyes
of
wonder
gazing
on
his
mother
hall
and
watery
kingdom
and
pools
and
echoing
groves
he
went
and
stunned
by
that
stupendous
whirl
of
waters
separate
saw
all
streams
beneath
the
mighty
earth
that
glide
phasis
and
lycus
and
that
whence
first
the
deep

leaps
to

whence

whence

whom
none

through
the
laughing
plains
more
furious
pours
into
the
purple
sea
soon
as
the
chamber
hanging

of

was
gained
and
now
cyrene
from
her

had
heard
his
idle
weeping
in

course
clear
water
for
his

the

bring
with

while

heap
the

all

show
and
grant
a

end
for
save
by
force
no

he
vouchsafe
nor
shalt
thou
bend
his
soul
by
praying
whom
once
made
captive
ply
with
rigorous
force
and
fetters
against
these
his
wiles
will
break
and
spend
themselves
in
vain
i
when
the
sun
has
lit
his
noontide
fires
when
the
blades
thirst
and
cattle
love
the
shade
myself
will
guide
thee
to
the
old
man
haunt
whither
he
hies
him
weary
from
the
waves
that
thou
mayst
safelier
steal
upon
his
sleep
but
when
thou
hast
gripped
him
fast
with
hand
and
gyve
then
divers
forms
and
bestial
semblances
shall
mock
thy
grasp
for
sudden
he
will
change
to
bristly
boar
fell
tigress
dragon
scaled
and
lioness
or
send
forth
a
crackling
sound
of
fire
and
so
shake
of
the
fetters
or
in
showery
drops
anon
dissolve
and
vanish
but
the
more
he
shifts
his
endless
transformations
thou
my
son
more
straitlier
clench
the
clinging
bands
until
his
body
shape
return
to
that
thou
sawest
when
with
closed
eyelids
first
he
sank
to
sleep
so
saying
an
odour
of
ambrosial
dew
she
sheds
around
and
all
his
frame
therewith
steeps
throughly
forth
from
his
locks
breathed
effluence
sweet
and
a
lithe
vigour
leapt
into
his
limbs
there
is
a
cavern
vast
scooped
in
the
where
wave
on
wave
by
the
wind
stress
is
driven
and
breaks
far
up
its
inmost
safe
anchorage
from
of
old
for
mariners
therewithin
behind
a
rock
huge
barrier
proteus
hides
here
in
close
covert
out
of
the
sun
eye
the
youth
she
places
and
herself
the
while
swathed
in
a
shadowy
mist
stands
far
aloof
and
now
the
ravening
that
burns
up
the
thirsty
indians
blazed
in
heaven
his
course
the
fiery
sun
had
half
devoured
the
blades
were
parched
and
the
void
streams
with
droughty
jaws
baked
to
their
by
the
scorching
ray
when
proteus
seeking
his
accustomed
cave
strode
from
the
billows
round
him
frolicking
the
watery
folk
that
people
the
waste
sea
sprinkled
the
bitter
far
and
wide
along
the
shore
in
scattered
groups
to
feed
the
stretch
them
while
the
seer
himself
like
herdsman
on
the
hills
when
evening
bids
the
steers
from
pasture
to
their
stall
repair
and
the
lambs
bleating
whets
the
listening
wolves
sits
midmost
on
the
rock
and
tells
his
tale
but
aristaeus
the
foe
within
his
clutch
scarce
suffering
him
compose
his
aged
limbs
with
a
great
cry
leapt
on
him
and
ere
he
rose
forestalled
him
with
the
fetters
he
nathless
all
unforgetful
of
his
ancient
craft
transforms
himself
to
every
wondrous
thing
fire
and
a
fearful
beast
and
flowing
stream
but
when
no
trickery
found
a
path
for
flight
baffled
at
length
to
his
own
shape
returned
with
human
lips
he
spake
who
bade
thee
then
so
reckless
in
youth
hardihood
affront
our
portals
or
what
wouldst
thou
hence
but
he
proteus
thou
knowest
of
thine
own
heart
thou
knowest
for
thee
there
is
no
cheating
but
cease
thou
to
practise
upon
me
at
heaven
behest
i
for
my
fainting
fortunes
hither
come
an
oracle
to
ask
thee
there
he
ceased
whereat
the
seer
by
stubborn
force
constrained
shot
forth
the
grey
light
of
his
gleaming
eyes
upon
him
and
with
fiercely
gnashing
teeth
unlocks
his
lips
to
spell
the
fates
of
heaven
doubt
not
is
wrath
divine
that
plagues
thee
thus
nor

the
debt
thou
payest
is
orpheus

orpheus
unhappy
by
no

of
his
so
fates
prevent
not
fans
thy

fires
yet
madly
raging
for
his
ravished
bride
she
in
her
haste
to
shun
thy
hot
pursuit
along
the
stream
saw
not
the
coming
death
where
at
her
feet
kept
ward
upon
the
bank
in
the
tall
grass
a
monstrous
but
with
their
cries
the
her
peers
filled
up
the
mountains
to
their
proudest
peaks
wailed
for
her
fate
the
heights
of
rhodope
and
tall
pangaea
and
beloved
of
mars
the
land
that
bowed
to
rhesus
thrace
no

with

thee
his

on

lone
shore
alone
thee
when
day
dawned
and
when
it
died
he
sang
nay
to
the
jaws
of
taenarus
too
he
came
of
dis
the
infernal
palace
and
the
grove
grim
with
a
horror
of
great
came
entered
and
faced
the
manes
and
the
king
of
terrors
the
stone
heart
no
prayer
can
tame
then
from
the
deepest
deeps
of
erebus
wrung
by
his
minstrelsy
the
hollow
shades
came
trooping
ghostly
semblances
of
forms
lost
to
the
light
as
birds
by
myriads
hie
to
greenwood
boughs
for
cover
when
or
storms
of
winter
chase
them
from
the
hills
matrons
and

and
great
heroic
frames
done
with

boys
unwedded

youths
placed
on

before
their
fathers
eyes
round
them
with
black
slime
choked
and
hideous
weed
cocytus

there
lies
the
unlovely
swamp
of
dull
dead
water
and
to
pen
them
fast
styx
with
her
ninefold
barrier
poured
between
nay
even
the
deep
tartarean
halls
of
death
stood
lost
in
wonderment
and
the
eumenides
their
brows
with
livid
locks
of
serpents
twined
even
cerberus
held
his
triple
jaws
agape
and
the
wind
hushed
ixion
wheel
stood
still
and
now
with
homeward
footstep
he
had
passed
all
perils
scathless
and
at
length
restored
eurydice
to
realms
of
upper
air
had
won
behind
him
so
proserpine
had
ruled
when
his
heart
a
sudden
mad
desire
surprised
and
meet
fault
to
be
forgiven
might
hell
forgive
for
at
the
very
threshold
of
the
day
heedless
alas
and
vanquished
of
resolve
he
stopped
turned
looked
upon
eurydice
his
own
once
more
but
even
with
the
look
poured
out
was
all
his
labour
broken
the
bond
of
that
fell
tyrant
and
a
crash
was
heard
three
times
like
thunder
in
the
meres
of
hell
what
ruin
hath
thy
frenzy
wrought
on
me
alas
and
thee
lo
once
again
the
unpitying
fates
recall
me
and
dark
sleep
closes
my
swimming
eyes
and
now
farewell
girt
with
enormous
night
i
am
borne
away
outstretching
toward
thee
thine
alas
no
more
these
helpless
hands
she
spake
and
suddenly
like
smoke
dissolving
into
empty
air
passed
and
was
sundered
from
his
sight
nor
him
clutching
vain
shadows
yearning
sore
to
speak
thenceforth
beheld
she
nor
no
second
time
hell
boatman
brooks
he
pass
the
watery
bar
what
should
he
do
fly
whither
twice
bereaved
move
with
what
tears
the
manes
with
what
voice
the
powers
of
darkness
she
indeed
even
now
was
floating
on
the
stygian
barge
for
seven
whole
months
unceasingly
men
say
beneath
a
skyey
crag
by
thy
lone
wave
strymon
he
wept
and
in
the
caverns
chill
unrolled
his
story
melting
tigers
hearts
and
leading
with
his
lay
the
oaks
along
as
in
the
a
nightingale
mourns
her
lost
young
which
some
relentless
swain
spying
from
the
nest
has
torn
unfledged
but
she
wails
the
long
night
and
perched
upon
a
spray
with
sad
insistence
pipes
her
dolorous
strain
till
all
the
region
with
her
wrongs
no
love
no
new
desire
constrained
his
soul
by
tanais
and
the
icy
north
far
steppes
to
frost
rhipaean
forever
wed
alone
he
wandered
lost
eurydice
lamenting
and
the
gifts
of
dis
ungiven
scorned
by
which
tribute
the
ciconian
dames
amid
their
awful
bacchanalian
rites
and
midnight
revellings
tore
him
limb
from
limb
and
strewed
his
fragments
over
the
wide
fields
then
too
even
then
what
time
the
hebrus
stream
oeagrian
hebrus
down
rolled
rent
from
the
marble
neck
his
drifting
head
the
tongue
found
yet
a
voice
to
cry
ah
poor
eurydice
with
parting
breath
he
called
her
and
the
banks
from
the
broad
stream
caught
up
so
proteus
ending
plunged
into
the
deep
and
where
he
plunged
beneath
the
eddying
whirl
churned
into
foam
the
water
and
was
gone
but
not
cyrene
who
unquestioned
thus
bespake
the
trembling
listener
nay
my
son
from
that
sad
bosom
thou
mayst
banish
care
hence
came
that
plague
of
sickness
hence
the
nymphs
with
whom
in
the
tall
woods
the
dance
she
wove
wrought
on
thy
bees
alas
this
deadly
bane
bend
thou
before
the
gracious
powers
bring
gifts
and
sue
for
pardon
they
will
grant
peace
to
thine
asking
and
an
end
of
wrath
but
how
to
approach
them
will
i
first
four
chosen
bulls
of
peerless
form
and
bulk
that
browse
the
green
lycaean
heights
pick
from
thy
herds
as
many
kine
to
match
whose
necks
the
yoke
pressed
never
then
for
these
build
up
four
altars
by
the
lofty
fanes
and
from
their
throats
let
gush
the
victims
blood
and
in
the
greenwood
leave
their
bodies
lone
then
when
the
ninth
dawn
hath
displayed
its
beams
to
orpheus
shalt
thou
send
his
funeral
dues
poppies
of
lethe
and
let
slay
a
sheep
then
seek
the
grove
again
and
soon
for
pardon
found
adore
eurydice
with
a
slain
calf
for
victim
no
delay
the
hour
he
hies
him
forth
to
do
his
mother
bidding
to
the
shrine
he
came
the
appointed
altars
reared
and
thither
led
four
chosen
bulls
of
peerless
form
and
bulk
with
kine
to
match
that
never
yoke
had
known
then
when
the
ninth
dawn
had
led
in
the
day
to
orpheus
sent
his
funeral
dues
and
sought
the
grove
once
more
but
sudden
strange
to
tell
a
portent
they
espy
through
the
oxen
flesh
waxed
soft
in
dissolution
hark
there
hum
bees
from
the
belly
the
rent
ribs
overboil
in
endless
clouds
they
spread
them
till
at
last
on
yon
together
fused
they
cling
and
drop
their
cluster
from
the
bending
boughs
so
sang
i
of
the
tilth
of
furrowed
fields
of
flocks
and
trees
while
caesar
majesty
launched
forth
the
of
war
by
deep
euphrates
and
bare
rule
willing
folk
though
vanquished
and
essayed
the
heights
of

i

then
of

the
nursling
wooed
the
flowery

of
