chapter
i
the
monastery
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
caucasus
mountains
a
wild
storm
was
gathering
drear
shadows
drooped
and
thickened
above
the
pass
of
dariel
that
terrific
gorge
which
like
a
mere
thread
seems
to
hang
between
the
toppling
heights
above
and
the
black
abysmal
depths
below
clouds
fringed
ominously
with
lurid
green
and
white
drifted
heavily
yet
swiftly
across
the
jagged
peaks
where
looming
largely
out
of
the
mist
the
crest
of
mount
kazbek
rose
coldly
white
against
the
darkness
of
the
threatening
sky
night
was
approaching
though
away
to
the
west
a
road
gash
of
crimson
a
seeming
wound
in
the
breast
of
heaven
showed
where
the
sun
had
set
an
hour
since
now
and
again
the
rising
wind
moaned
sobbingly
through
the
tall
and
spectral
pines
that
with
knotted
roots
fast
clenched
in
the
reluctant
earth
clung
tenaciously
to
their
stony
vantageground
and
mingling
with
its
wailing
murmur
there
came
a
distant
hoarse
roaring
as
of
tumbling
torrents
while
at
intervals
could
be
heard
the
sweeping
thud
of
an
avalanche
slipping
from
point
to
point
on
its
disastrous
downward
way
through
the
wreathing
vapors
the
steep
bare
sides
of
the
near
mountains
were
pallidly
visible
their
icy
pinnacles
like
uplifted
daggers
piercing
with
sharp
glitter
the
density
of
the
haze
from
which
large
drops
of
moisture
began
presently
to
ooze
rather
than
fall
gradually
the
wind
increased
and
soon
with
sudden
fierce
gusts
shook
the
into
shuddering
anxiety
the
red
slit
in
the
sky
closed
and
a
gleam
of
forked
lightning
leaped
athwart
the
driving
darkness
an
appalling
crash
of
thunder
followed
almost
instantaneously
its
deep
boom
vibrating
in
sullenly
grand
echoes
on
all
sides
of
the
pass
and
then
with
a
swirling
hissing
rush
of
rain
the
unbound
hurricane
burst
forth
alive
and
furious
on
on
splitting
huge
boughs
and
flinging
them
aside
like
straws
swelling
the
rivers
into
riotous
floods
that
swept
hither
and
thither
carrying
with
them
masses
of
rock
and
stone
and
tons
of
loosened
snow
on
on
with
pitiless
force
and
destructive
haste
the
tempest
rolled
thundered
and
shrieked
its
way
through
dariel
as
the
night
darkened
and
the
clamor
of
the
conflicting
elements
grew
more
sustained
and
violent
a
sudden
sweet
sound
floated
softly
through
the
turbulent
air
the
slow
measured
tolling
of
a
bell
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
the
silvery
chime
swung
with
mild
distinctness
it
was
the
ringing
in
the
monastery
of
lars
far
up
among
the
crags
crowning
the
ravine
there
the
wind
roared
and
blustered
its
loudest
it
whirled
round
and
round
the
quaint
castellated
building
battering
the
gates
and
moving
their
heavy
iron
hinges
to
a
most
dolorous
groaning
it
flung
rattling
hailstones
at
the
narrow
windows
and
raged
and
howled
at
every
corner
and
through
every
crevice
while
snaky
twists
of
lightning
played
threateningly
over
the
tall
iron
cross
that
surmounted
the
roof
as
though
bent
on
striking
it
down
and
splitting
open
the
firm
old
walls
it
guarded
all
was
war
and
tumult
without
but
within
a
tranquil
peace
prevailed
enhanced
by
the
grave
murmur
of
organ
music
men
voices
mingling
together
in
mellow
unison
chanted
the
magnificat
and
the
uplifted
steady
harmony
of
the
grand
old
anthem
rose
triumphantly
above
the
noise
of
the
storm
the
monks
who
inhabited
this
mountain
eyrie
once
a
fortress
now
a
religious
refuge
were
assembled
in
their
little
chapel
a
sort
of
grotto
roughly
hewn
out
of
the
natural
rock
fifteen
in
number
they
stood
in
rows
of
three
abreast
their
white
woollen
robes
touching
the
ground
their
white
cowls
thrown
back
and
their
dark
faces
and
flashing
eyes
turned
devoutly
toward
the
altar
whereon
blazed
in
strange
and
solitary
brilliancy
a
cross
of
fire
at
the
first
glance
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
were
a
peculiar
community
devoted
to
some
peculiar
form
of
worship
for
their
costume
was
totally
different
in
character
and
detail
from
any
such
as
are
worn
by
the
various
religious
fraternities
of
the
greek
roman
or
armenian
faith
and
one
especial
feature
of
their
outward
appearance
served
as
a
distinctly
marked
sign
of
their
severance
from
all
known
monastic
orders
this
was
the
absence
of
the
disfiguring
tonsure
they
were
all
men
seemingly
in
the
prime
of
life
and
they
intoned
the
magnificat
not
drowsily
or
droningly
but
with
a
rich
tunefulness
and
warmth
of
utterance
that
stirred
to
a
faint
surprise
and
contempt
the
jaded
spirit
of
one
reluctant
listener
present
among
them
this
was
a
stranger
who
had
arrived
that
evening
at
the
monastery
and
who
intended
remaining
there
for
the
night
a
man
of
distinguished
and
somewhat
haughty
bearing
with
a
dark
sorrowful
poetic
face
chiefly
remarkable
for
its
mingled
expression
of
dreamy
ardor
and
cold
scorn
an
expression
such
as
the
unknown
sculptor
of
hadrian
era
caught
and
fixed
in
the
marble
of
his
whose
smile
suggests
a
perpetual
doubt
of
all
things
and
all
men
he
was
clad
in
the
garb
of
the
travelling
englishman
and
his
athletic
figure
in
its
modern
attire
looked
curiously
out
of
place
in
that
mysterious
grotto
which
with
its
rocky
walls
and
flaming
symbol
of
salvation
seem
suited
only
to
the
picturesque
forms
of
the
brethren
whom
he
now
surveyed
as
he
stood
behind
their
ranks
with
a
gleam
of
something
like
mockery
in
his
proud
weary
eyes
what
sort
of
fellows
are
these
he
mused
fools
or
knaves
they
must
be
one
or
the
other
else
they
would
not
thus
chant
praises
to
a
deity
of
whose
existence
there
is
and
can
be
no
proof
it
is
either
sheer
ignorance
or
hypocrisy
or
both
combined
i
can
pardon
ignorance
but
not
hypocrisy
for
however
dreary
the
results
of
truth
yet
truth
alone
prevails
its
killing
bolt
destroys
the
illusive
beauty
of
the
universe
but
what
then
is
it
not
better
so
than
that
the
universe
should
continue
to
seem
beautiful
only
through
the
medium
of
a
lie
his
straight
brows
drew
together
in
a
puzzled
frowning
line
as
he
asked
himself
this
question
and
he
moved
restlessly
he
was
becoming
impatient
the
chanting
of
the
monks
grew
monotonous
to
his
ears
the
lighted
cross
on
the
altar
dazzled
him
with
its
glare
moreover
he
disliked
all
forms
of
religious
service
though
as
a
lover
of
classic
lore
it
is
probable
he
would
have
witnessed
a
celebration
in
honor
of
apollo
or
diana
with
the
liveliest
interest
but
the
very
name
of
christianity
was
obnoxious
to
him
like
shelley
he
considered
that
creed
a
vulgar
and
barbarous
superstition
like
shelley
he
inquired
if
god
has
spoken
why
is
the
world
not
convinced
he
began
to
wish
he
had
never
set
foot
inside
this
abode
of
what
he
deemed
a
pretended
sanctity
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
a
special
purpose
of
his
own
in
visiting
the
purpose
so
utterly
at
variance
with
the
professed
tenets
of
his
present
life
and
character
that
the
mere
thought
of
it
secretly
irritated
him
even
while
he
was
determined
to
accomplish
it
as
yet
he
had
only
made
acquaintance
with
two
of
the
monks
courteous
personages
who
had
received
him
on
his
arrival
with
the
customary
hospitality
which
it
was
the
rule
of
the
monastery
to
afford
to
all
belated
wayfarers
journeying
across
the
perilous
pass
of
dariel
they
had
asked
him
no
questions
as
to
his
name
or
nation
they
had
simply
seen
in
him
a
stranger
overtaken
by
the
storm
and
in
need
of
shelter
and
had
entertained
him
accordingly
they
had
conducted
him
to
the
refectory
where
a
log
fire
was
cheerfully
blazing
and
there
had
set
before
him
an
excellent
supper
flavored
with
equally
excellent
wine
he
had
however
scarcely
begun
to
converse
with
them
when
the
had
rung
and
obedient
to
its
summons
they
had
hurried
away
leaving
him
to
enjoy
his
repast
in
solitude
when
he
had
finished
it
he
had
sat
for
a
while
dreamily
listening
to
the
solemn
strains
of
the
organ
which
penetrated
to
every
part
of
the
building
and
then
moved
by
a
vague
curiosity
to
see
how
many
men
there
were
dwelling
thus
together
in
this
lonely
retreat
perched
like
an
eagle
nest
among
the
frozen
heights
of
caucasus
he
had
managed
to
find
his
way
guided
by
the
sound
of
the
music
through
various
long
corridors
and
narrow
twisting
passages
into
the
cavernous
grot
where
he
now
stood
feeling
infinitely
bored
and
listlessly
dissatisfied
his
primary
object
in
entering
the
chapel
had
been
to
get
a
good
full
view
of
the
monks
and
of
their
faces
especially
but
at
present
this
was
impossible
as
from
the
position
he
was
obliged
to
occupy
behind
them
their
backs
alone
were
visible
and
who
knows
he
thought
moodily
how
long
they
will
go
on
intoning
their
dreary
latin
doggerel
priestcraft
and
sham
there
no
escape
from
it
anywhere
not
even
in
the
wilds
of
caucasus
i
wonder
if
the
man
i
seek
is
really
here
or
whether
after
all
i
have
been
misled
there
are
so
many
contradictory
stories
told
about
him
that
one
know
what
to
believe
it
seems
incredible
that
he
should
be
a
monk
it
is
such
an
altogether
foolish
ending
to
an
intellectual
career
for
whatever
may
be
the
form
of
faith
professed
by
this
particular
fraternity
the
absurdity
of
the
whole
system
of
religion
remains
the
same
religion
day
is
done
the
very
sense
of
worship
is
a
mere
coward
instinct
a
relic
of
barbarism
which
is
being
gradually
eradicated
from
our
natures
by
the
progress
of
civilization
the
world
knows
by
this
time
that
creation
is
an
empty
jest
we
are
all
beginning
to
understand
its
bathos
and
if
we
must
grant
that
there
is
some
mischievous
supreme
farceur
who
safely
shrouded
in
invisibility
continues
to
perpetrate
so
poor
and
purposeless
a
joke
for
his
own
amusement
and
our
torture
we
need
not
for
that
matter
admire
his
wit
or
flatter
his
ingenuity
for
life
is
nothing
but
vexation
and
suffering
are
we
dogs
that
we
should
lick
the
hand
that
crushes
us
at
that
moment
the
chanting
suddenly
ceased
the
organ
went
on
as
though
musically
meditating
to
itself
in
minor
cords
through
which
soft
upper
notes
like
touches
of
light
on
a
dark
landscape
flickered
ripplingly
one
monk
separated
himself
from
the
clustered
group
and
stepping
slowly
up
to
the
altar
confronted
the
rest
of
his
brethren
the
fiery
cross
shone
radiantly
behind
him
its
beams
seeming
to
gather
in
a
lustrous
halo
round
his
tall
majestic
figure
his
countenance
fully
illumined
and
clearly
visible
was
one
never
to
be
forgotten
for
the
striking
force
sweetness
and
dignity
expressed
in
its
every
feature
the
veriest
scoffer
that
ever
made
mock
of
fine
beliefs
and
fair
virtues
must
have
been
momentarily
awed
and
silenced
in
the
presence
of
such
a
man
as
this
a
man
upon
whom
the
grace
of
a
perfect
life
seemed
to
have
fallen
like
a
royal
robe
investing
even
his
outward
appearance
with
spiritual
authority
and
grandeur
at
sight
of
him
the
stranger
indifferent
air
rapidly
changed
to
one
of
eager
interest
leaning
forward
he
regarded
him
intently
with
a
look
of
mingled
astonishment
and
unwilling
admiration
the
monk
meanwhile
extended
his
hands
as
though
in
blessing
and
spoke
aloud
his
latin
words
echoing
through
the
rocky
temple
with
the
measured
utterance
of
poetical
rhythm
translated
they
ran
thus
glory
to
god
the
most
high
the
supreme
and
eternal
and
with
one
harmonious
murmur
of
accord
the
brethren
responded
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
glory
to
god
the
ruler
of
spirits
and
master
of
angels
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
glory
to
god
who
in
love
never
wearies
of
loving
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
glory
to
god
in
the
name
of
his
christ
our
redeemer
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
glory
to
god
for
the
joys
of
the
past
the
present
and
future
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
glory
to
god
for
the
power
of
will
and
the
working
of
wisdom
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
glory
to
god
for
the
briefness
of
life
the
gladness
of
death
and
the
promised
immortal
hereafter
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
then
came
a
pause
during
which
the
thunder
outside
added
a
tumultuous
gloria
of
its
own
to
those
already
recited
the
organ
music
died
away
into
silence
and
the
monk
now
turning
so
that
he
faced
the
altar
sank
reverently
on
his
knees
all
present
followed
his
example
with
the
exception
of
the
stranger
who
as
if
in
deliberate
defiance
drew
himself
resolutely
up
to
his
full
height
and
folding
his
arms
gazed
at
the
scene
before
him
with
a
perfectly
unmoved
demeanor
he
expected
to
hear
some
long
prayer
but
none
came
there
was
an
absolute
stillness
unbroken
save
by
the
rattle
of
the
against
the
high
oriel
window
and
the
whistling
rush
of
the
wind
and
as
he
looked
the
fiery
cross
began
to
grow
dim
and
pale
little
by
little
its
scintillating
lustre
decreased
till
at
last
it
disappeared
altogether
leaving
no
trace
of
its
former
brilliancy
but
a
small
bright
flame
that
gradually
took
the
shape
of
a
star
which
sparkled
through
the
gloom
like
a
suspended
ruby
the
chapel
was
left
almost
in
complete
darkness
he
could
scarcely
discern
even
the
white
figures
of
the
kneeling
worshippers
a
haunting
sense
of
the
supernatural
seemed
to
permeate
that
deep
hush
and
dense
shadow
and
notwithstanding
his
habitual
tendency
to
despise
all
religious
ceremonies
there
was
something
novel
and
strange
about
this
one
which
exercised
a
peculiar
influence
upon
his
imagination
a
sudden
odd
fancy
possessed
him
that
there
were
others
present
besides
himself
and
the
brethren
but
who
these
others
were
he
could
not
determine
it
was
an
altogether
uncanny
uncomfortable
impression
yet
it
was
very
strong
upon
him
and
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
intense
relief
when
he
heard
the
soft
melody
of
the
organ
once
more
and
saw
the
oaken
doors
of
the
grotto
swing
wide
open
to
admit
a
flood
of
cheerful
light
from
the
outer
passage
the
vespers
were
over
the
monks
rose
and
paced
forth
two
by
two
not
with
bent
heads
and
downcast
eyes
as
though
affecting
an
abased
humility
but
with
the
free
and
stately
bearing
of
kings
returning
from
some
high
conquest
drawing
a
little
further
back
into
his
retired
corner
he
watched
them
pass
and
was
forced
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
had
seldom
or
never
seen
finer
types
of
splendid
healthful
and
vigorous
manhood
at
its
best
and
brightest
as
noble
specimens
of
the
human
race
alone
they
were
well
worth
looking
at
they
might
have
been
warriors
princes
emperors
he
thought
anything
but
monks
yet
monks
they
were
and
followers
of
that
christian
creed
he
so
specially
condemned
for
each
one
wore
on
his
breast
a
massive
golden
crucifix
hung
to
a
chain
and
fastened
with
a
jewelled
star
cross
and
star
he
mused
as
he
noticed
this
brilliant
and
singular
decoration
an
emblem
of
the
fraternity
i
suppose
meaning
what
salvation
and
immortality
alas
they
are
poor
witless
builders
on
shifting
sand
if
they
place
any
hope
or
reliance
on
those
two
empty
words
signifying
nothing
do
they
can
they
honestly
believe
in
god
i
wonder
or
are
they
only
acting
the
usual
comedy
of
a
feigned
faith
and
he
eyed
them
somewhat
wistfully
as
their
white
apparelled
figures
went
by
ten
had
already
left
the
chapel
two
more
passed
then
other
two
and
last
of
all
came
one
alone
one
who
walked
slowly
with
a
dreamy
meditative
air
as
though
he
were
deeply
absorbed
in
thought
the
light
from
the
open
door
streamed
fully
upon
him
as
he
advanced
it
was
the
monk
who
had
recited
the
seven
glorias
the
stranger
no
sooner
beheld
him
than
he
instantly
stepped
forward
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
pardon
he
said
hastily
in
english
i
think
i
am
not
mistaken
your
name
is
or
used
to
be
heliobas
the
monk
bent
his
handsome
head
in
a
slight
yet
graceful
salutation
and
smiled
i
have
not
changed
it
he
replied
i
am
heliobas
still
and
his
keen
steadfast
blue
eyes
rested
half
inquiringly
half
compassionately
on
the
dark
weary
troubled
face
of
his
questioner
who
avoiding
his
direct
gaze
continued
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
in
private
can
i
do
so
now
at
once
by
all
means
assented
the
monk
showing
no
surprise
at
the
request
follow
me
to
the
library
we
shall
be
quite
alone
there
he
led
the
way
immediately
out
of
the
chapel
and
through
a
vestibule
where
they
were
met
by
the
two
brethren
who
had
first
received
and
entertained
the
unknown
guest
and
who
not
finding
him
in
the
refectory
where
they
had
left
him
were
now
coming
in
search
of
him
on
seeing
in
whose
company
he
was
however
they
drew
aside
with
a
deep
and
reverential
obeisance
to
the
personage
called
heliobas
he
silently
acknowledging
it
passed
on
closely
attended
by
the
stranger
till
he
reached
a
spacious
apartment
the
walls
of
which
were
entirely
lined
with
books
here
entering
and
closing
the
door
he
turned
and
confronted
his
visitor
his
tall
imposing
figure
in
its
trailing
white
garments
calling
to
mind
the
picture
of
some
saint
or
evangelist
and
with
grave
yet
kindly
courtesy
said
now
my
friend
i
am
at
your
disposal
in
what
way
can
heliobas
who
is
dead
to
the
world
serve
one
for
whom
surely
as
yet
the
world
is
everything
chapter
ii
confession
his
question
was
not
very
promptly
answered
the
stranger
stood
still
regarding
him
intently
for
two
of
three
minutes
with
a
look
of
peculiar
pensiveness
and
abstraction
the
heavy
double
fringe
of
his
long
dark
lashes
giving
an
almost
drowsy
pathos
to
his
proud
and
earnest
eyes
soon
however
this
absorbed
expression
changed
to
one
of
sombre
scorn
the
world
he
said
slowly
and
bitterly
you
think
care
for
the
world
then
you
read
me
wrongly
at
the
very
outset
of
our
interview
and
your
once
reputed
skill
as
a
seer
goes
for
naught
to
me
the
world
is
a
graveyard
full
of
dead
things
and
its
supposititious
creator
whom
you
have
so
be
praised
in
your
orisons
is
the
sexton
who
entombs
and
the
ghoul
who
devours
his
own
hapless
creation
i
myself
am
one
of
the
tortured
and
dying
and
i
have
sought
you
simply
that
you
may
trick
me
into
a
brief
oblivion
of
my
doom
and
mock
me
with
the
mirage
of
a
life
that
is
not
and
can
never
be
how
can
you
serve
me
give
me
a
few
hours
respite
from
wretchedness
that
is
all
i
ask
as
he
spoke
his
face
grew
blanched
and
haggard
as
though
he
suffered
from
some
painfully
repressed
inward
agony
the
monk
heliobas
heard
him
with
an
air
of
attentive
patience
but
said
nothing
he
therefore
after
waiting
for
a
reply
and
receiving
none
went
on
in
colder
and
more
even
tones
i
dare
say
my
words
seem
strange
to
you
though
they
should
not
do
so
if
as
reported
you
have
studied
all
the
varying
phases
of
that
purely
intellectual
despair
which
in
this
age
of
excessive
crushes
men
who
learn
too
much
and
think
too
deeply
but
before
going
further
i
had
better
introduce
myself
my
name
is
alwyn
theos
alwyn
the
english
author
i
presume
interposed
the
monk
interrogatively
why
yes
this
in
accents
of
extreme
surprise
how
did
you
know
that
your
celebrity
politely
suggested
heliobas
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
an
enigmatical
smile
that
might
have
meant
anything
or
nothing
alwyn
colored
a
little
your
mistake
he
said
indifferently
i
have
no
celebrity
the
celebrities
of
my
country
are
few
and
among
them
those
most
admired
are
jockeys
and
divorced
women
i
merely
follow
in
the
of
the
art
or
profession
of
literature
i
am
that
always
unluckiest
and
most
undesirable
kind
of
an
author
a
writer
of
verse
i
lay
no
claim
not
now
at
any
rate
to
the
title
of
poet
while
recently
staying
in
paris
i
chanced
to
hear
of
you
the
monk
bowed
ever
so
slightly
there
was
a
dawning
gleam
of
satire
in
his
brilliant
eyes
you
won
special
distinction
and
renown
there
i
believe
before
you
adopted
this
monastic
life
pursued
alwyn
glancing
at
him
curiously
did
i
and
heliobas
looked
cheerfully
interested
really
i
was
not
aware
of
it
i
assure
you
possibly
my
ways
and
doings
may
have
occasionally
furnished
the
parisians
with
something
to
talk
about
instead
of
the
weather
and
i
know
i
made
some
few
friends
and
an
astonishing
number
of
enemies
if
that
is
what
you
mean
by
distinction
and
renown
alwyn
smiled
his
smile
was
always
reluctant
and
had
in
it
more
of
sadness
than
sweetness
yet
it
gave
his
features
a
singular
softness
and
beauty
just
as
a
ray
of
sunlight
falling
on
a
dark
picture
will
brighten
the
tints
into
a
momentary
warmth
of
seeming
life
all
reputation
means
that
i
think
he
said
unless
it
be
mediocre
then
one
is
safe
one
has
scores
of
friends
and
scarce
a
foe
mediocrity
succeeds
wonderfully
well
nowadays
nobody
hates
it
because
every
one
feels
how
easily
they
themselves
can
attain
to
it
exceptional
talent
is
aggressive
actual
genius
is
offensive
people
are
insulted
to
have
a
thing
held
up
for
their
admiration
which
is
entirely
out
of
their
reach
they
become
like
bears
climbing
a
greased
pole
they
see
a
great
name
above
them
a
tempting
sugary
morsel
which
they
would
fain
snatch
and
devour
and
when
their
uncouth
efforts
fail
they
huddle
together
on
the
ground
beneath
look
up
with
dull
peering
eyes
and
impotently
snarl
but
you
and
here
his
gazed
rested
doubtfully
yet
questioningly
on
his
companion
open
serene
countenance
you
if
rumor
speaks
truly
should
have
been
able
to
tame
your
bears
and
turn
them
into
dogs
humble
and
couchant
your
marvellous
achievements
as
a
mesmerist
excuse
me
returned
heliobas
quietly
i
never
was
a
mesmerist
a
spiritualist
then
though
i
can
not
admit
the
existence
of
any
such
thing
as
spiritualism
neither
can
i
returned
heliobas
with
perfect
according
to
the
generally
accepted
meaning
of
the
term
pray
go
on
mr
alwyn
alwyn
looked
at
him
a
little
puzzled
and
uncertain
how
to
proceed
a
curious
sense
of
irritation
was
growing
up
in
his
mind
against
this
monk
with
the
grand
head
and
flashing
eyes
eyes
that
seemed
to
strip
bare
his
innermost
thoughts
as
lightning
strips
bark
from
a
tree
i
was
told
he
continued
after
a
pause
during
which
he
had
apparently
considered
and
prepared
his
words
that
you
were
chiefly
known
in
paris
as
being
the
possessor
of
some
mysterious
internal
force
call
it
magnetic
hypnotic
or
spiritual
as
you
please
which
though
perfectly
inexplicable
was
yet
plainly
manifested
and
evident
to
all
who
placed
themselves
under
your
influence
moreover
that
by
this
force
you
were
able
to
deal
scientifically
and
practically
with
the
active
principle
of
intelligence
in
man
to
such
an
extent
that
you
could
in
some
miraculous
way
disentangle
the
knots
of
toil
and
perplexity
in
an
brain
and
restore
to
it
its
pristine
vitality
and
vigor
is
this
true
if
so
exert
your
power
upon
me
for
something
i
know
not
what
has
of
late
frozen
up
the
once
overflowing
fountain
of
my
thoughts
and
i
have
lost
all
working
ability
when
a
man
can
no
longer
work
it
were
best
he
should
die
only
unfortunately
i
can
not
die
unless
i
kill
myself
which
it
is
possible
i
may
do
ere
long
but
in
the
meantime
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
went
on
in
the
meantime
i
have
a
strong
wish
to
be
deluded
i
use
the
word
advisedly
and
repeat
it
deluded
into
an
imaginary
happiness
though
i
am
aware
that
as
an
agnostic
and
searcher
after
truth
truth
absolute
truth
positive
such
a
desire
on
my
part
seems
even
to
myself
inconsistent
and
unreasonable
still
i
confess
to
having
it
and
therein
i
know
i
betray
the
weakness
of
my
nature
it
may
be
that
i
am
tired
and
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
with
a
troubled
gesture
or
puzzled
by
the
infinite
incurable
distress
of
all
living
things
perhaps
i
am
growing
mad
who
knows
but
whatever
my
condition
you
if
report
be
correct
have
the
magic
skill
to
ravish
the
mind
away
from
its
troubles
and
transport
it
to
a
radiant
elysium
of
sweet
illusions
and
ethereal
ecstasies
do
this
for
me
as
you
have
done
it
for
others
and
whatever
payment
you
demand
whether
in
gold
or
gratitude
shall
be
yours
he
ceased
the
wind
howled
furiously
outside
flinging
gusty
dashes
of
rain
against
the
one
window
of
the
room
a
tall
arched
casement
that
clattered
noisily
with
every
blow
inflicted
upon
it
by
the
storm
heliobas
gave
him
a
swift
searching
glance
half
pitying
half
disdainful
haschisch
or
opium
should
serve
your
turn
he
said
curtly
i
know
of
no
other
means
whereby
to
temporarily
still
the
clamorings
of
conscience
alwyn
flushed
darkly
conscience
he
began
in
rather
a
resentful
tone
aye
conscience
repeated
heliobas
firmly
there
is
such
a
thing
do
you
profess
to
be
wholly
without
it
alwyn
deigned
no
reply
the
ironical
bluntness
of
the
question
annoyed
him
you
have
formed
a
very
unjust
opinion
of
me
alwyn
continued
heliobas
an
opinion
which
neither
honors
your
courtesy
nor
your
intellect
pardon
me
for
saying
so
you
ask
me
to
and
you
as
if
it
were
my
custom
and
delight
to
make
dupes
of
my
suffering
you
come
to
me
as
though
i
were
a
mesmerist
or
magnetizer
such
as
you
can
hire
for
a
few
guineas
in
any
civilized
city
in
europe
nay
i
doubt
not
but
that
you
consider
me
that
kind
of
whose
enlightened
intelligence
and
aims
are
demonstrated
in
the
turning
of
tables
and
general
i
am
however
hopelessly
deficient
in
such
knowledge
i
should
make
a
most
unsatisfactory
conjurer
moreover
whatever
you
may
have
heard
concerning
me
in
paris
you
must
remember
i
am
in
paris
no
longer
i
am
a
monk
as
you
see
devoted
to
my
vocation
i
am
completely
severed
from
the
world
and
my
duties
and
occupations
in
the
present
are
widely
different
to
those
which
employed
me
in
the
past
then
i
gave
what
aid
i
could
to
those
who
honestly
needed
it
and
sought
it
without
prejudice
or
personal
distrust
but
now
my
work
among
men
is
finished
and
i
practice
my
science
such
as
it
is
on
others
no
more
except
in
very
rare
and
special
cases
alwyn
heard
and
the
lines
of
his
face
hardened
into
an
expression
of
frigid
hauteur
i
suppose
i
am
to
understand
by
this
that
you
will
do
nothing
for
me
he
said
stiffly
why
what
can
i
do
returned
heliobas
smiling
a
little
all
you
want
so
you
say
is
a
brief
forgetfulness
of
your
troubles
well
that
is
easily
obtainable
through
certain
narcotics
if
you
choose
to
employ
them
and
take
the
risk
of
their
injurious
action
on
your
bodily
system
you
can
drug
your
brain
and
thereby
fill
it
with
drowsy
suggestions
of
ideas
of
course
they
would
only
he
suggestions
and
very
vague
and
indefinite
ones
too
still
they
might
be
pleasant
enough
to
absorb
and
repress
bitter
memories
for
a
time
as
for
me
my
poor
skill
would
scarcely
avail
you
as
i
could
promise
you
neither
nor
visionary
joy
i
have
a
certain
internal
force
it
is
true
a
spiritual
force
which
when
strongly
exercised
overpowers
and
subdues
the
material
and
by
exerting
this
i
could
if
i
thought
it
well
to
do
so
release
your
soul
that
is
the
inner
intelligent
spirit
which
is
the
actual
you
from
its
house
of
clay
and
allow
it
an
interval
of
freedom
but
what
its
experience
might
be
in
that
unfettered
condition
whether
glad
or
sorrowful
i
am
totally
unable
to
predict
alwyn
looked
at
him
steadfastly
you
believe
in
the
soul
he
asked
most
certainly
as
a
separate
personality
that
continues
to
live
on
when
the
body
perishes
assuredly
and
you
profess
to
be
able
to
liberate
it
for
a
time
from
its
mortal
habitation
i
do
not
profess
interposed
heliobas
quietly
i
can
do
so
but
with
the
success
of
the
experiment
your
power
ceases
you
can
not
foretell
whether
the
unimprisoned
creature
will
take
its
course
to
an
inferno
of
suffering
or
a
heaven
of
delight
is
this
what
you
mean
heliobas
bent
his
head
in
grave
assent
alwyn
broke
into
a
harsh
laugh
come
then
he
exclaimed
with
a
reckless
air
begin
your
incantations
at
once
send
me
hence
no
matter
where
so
long
as
i
am
for
a
while
escaped
from
this
den
of
a
world
this
dungeon
with
one
small
window
through
which
with
the
death
rattle
in
our
throats
we
stare
vacantly
at
the
blank
unmeaning
honor
of
the
universe
prove
to
me
that
the
soul
exists
ye
gods
prove
it
and
if
mine
can
find
its
way
straight
to
the
mainspring
of
this
revolving
creation
it
shall
cling
to
the
accused
wheels
and
stop
them
that
they
may
grind
out
the
tortures
of
life
no
more
he
flung
up
his
hand
with
a
wild
gesture
his
countenance
darkly
threatening
and
defiant
was
yet
beautiful
with
the
evil
beauty
of
a
rebellious
and
fallen
angel
his
breath
came
and
went
quickly
he
seemed
to
challenge
some
invisible
opponent
heliobas
meanwhile
watched
him
much
as
a
physician
might
watch
in
his
patient
the
workings
of
a
new
disease
then
he
said
in
purposely
cold
and
tranquil
tones
a
bold
idea
singularly
blasphemous
arrogant
and
fortunately
for
us
all
impracticable
allow
me
to
remark
that
you
are
overexcited
alwyn
you
talk
as
madmen
may
but
as
reasonable
men
should
not
come
and
he
smiled
a
smile
that
was
both
grave
and
sweet
come
and
sit
down
you
are
worn
out
with
the
force
of
your
own
desperate
emotions
rest
a
few
minutes
and
recover
your
self
his
voice
thouqh
gentle
was
distinctly
authoritative
and
alwyn
meeting
the
full
gaze
of
his
calm
eyes
felt
bound
to
obey
the
implied
command
he
therefore
sank
listlessly
into
an
easy
chair
near
the
table
pushing
back
the
short
thick
curls
from
his
brow
with
a
wearied
movement
he
was
very
pale
an
uneasy
sense
of
shame
was
upon
him
and
he
sighed
a
quick
sigh
of
exhausted
passion
heliobas
seated
himself
opposite
and
looked
at
him
earnestly
he
studied
with
sympathetic
attention
the
lines
of
dejection
and
fatigue
which
marred
the
attractiveness
of
features
otherwise
frank
poetic
and
noble
he
had
seen
many
such
men
men
in
their
prime
who
had
begun
life
full
of
high
faith
hope
and
lofty
aspiration
yet
whose
fair
ideals
once
bruised
in
the
mortar
of
modern
atheistical
opinion
had
perished
forever
while
they
themselves
like
golden
eagles
suddenly
and
cruelly
shot
while
flying
in
had
fallen
helplessly
among
the
of
the
world
never
to
rise
and
soar
sunwards
again
thinking
this
his
accents
were
touched
with
a
certain
compassion
when
after
a
pause
he
said
softly
poor
boy
poor
puzzled
tired
brain
that
would
fain
judge
infinity
by
merely
finite
perception
you
were
a
far
truer
poet
theos
alwyn
when
as
a
lad
you
believed
in
god
and
therefore
in
godlike
gladness
found
all
things
good
alwyn
looked
up
his
lips
quivered
poet
poet
he
murmured
why
taunt
me
with
the
name
he
started
upright
in
his
chair
let
me
tell
you
all
he
said
suddenly
you
may
as
well
know
what
has
made
me
the
useless
wreck
i
am
though
perhaps
i
shall
only
weary
you
far
from
it
answered
heliobas
gently
speak
freely
but
remember
i
do
not
compel
your
confidence
on
the
contrary
i
think
you
do
and
again
that
faint
smile
shone
for
an
instant
in
his
deep
dark
eyes
though
you
may
not
be
conscious
of
it
anyhow
i
feel
impelled
to
unburden
my
heart
to
you
i
have
kept
silence
so
long
you
know
what
it
is
in
the
world
one
must
always
keep
silence
always
shut
in
one
grief
and
force
a
smile
in
company
with
the
rest
of
the
tormented
crowd
we
can
never
be
ourselves
our
veritable
selves
for
if
we
were
the
air
would
resound
with
our
ceaseless
lamentations
it
is
horrible
to
think
of
all
the
sufferings
of
humanity
all
the
inconceivably
hideous
agonies
that
remain
forever
dumb
and
unrevealed
when
i
was
young
how
long
ago
that
seems
yes
though
my
actual
years
are
taut
thirty
i
feel
an
of
accumulated
centuries
upon
me
when
i
was
young
the
dream
of
my
life
was
poesy
perhaps
i
inherited
the
fatal
love
of
it
from
my
mother
she
was
a
she
had
a
subtle
music
in
her
that
nothing
could
quell
not
even
my
father
english
coldness
she
named
me
theos
little
guessing
what
a
dreary
sarcasm
that
name
would
prove
it
was
well
i
think
that
she
died
early
well
for
her
but
perhaps
not
so
well
for
you
said
heliobas
with
a
keen
kindly
glance
at
him
alwyn
sighed
nay
well
for
us
both
for
i
should
have
chafed
at
her
loving
restraint
and
she
would
unquestionably
have
been
disappointed
in
me
my
father
was
a
conscientious
methodical
business
man
who
spent
all
his
days
up
to
almost
the
last
moment
of
his
life
in
amassing
money
though
it
never
gave
him
any
joy
so
far
as
i
could
see
and
when
at
his
death
i
became
sole
possessor
of
his
fortune
i
felt
far
more
sorrow
than
satisfaction
i
wished
he
had
spent
his
gold
on
himself
and
left
me
poor
for
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
need
of
nothing
save
the
little
i
earned
by
my
pen
i
was
content
to
live
an
anchorite
and
dine
off
a
crust
for
the
sake
of
the
divine
muse
i
worshipped
fate
however
willed
it
otherwise
and
though
i
scarcely
cared
for
the
wealth
i
inherited
it
gave
me
at
least
one
blessing
that
of
perfect
independence
i
was
free
to
follow
my
own
chosen
vocation
and
for
a
brief
wondering
while
i
deemed
myself
happy
happy
as
keats
must
have
been
when
the
fragment
of
broke
from
his
frail
life
as
thunder
breaks
from
a
i
was
as
a
monarch
swaying
a
sceptre
that
commanded
both
earth
and
heaven
a
kingdom
was
kingdom
of
golden
ether
peopled
with
shining
shapes
protean
alas
its
gates
are
shut
upon
me
now
and
i
shall
enter
it
no
more
more
is
a
long
time
my
friend
interposed
heliobas
gently
you
are
too
despondent
perchance
too
diffident
concerning
your
own
ability
ability
and
he
laughed
wearily
i
have
none
i
am
as
weak
and
inapt
as
an
untaught
child
the
music
of
my
heart
is
silenced
yet
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
to
regain
the
ravishment
of
the
past
when
the
sight
of
the
sunset
across
the
hills
or
the
silver
transfiguration
of
the
sea
filled
me
with
deep
and
indescribable
ecstasy
when
the
thought
of
love
like
a
full
chord
struck
from
a
magic
harp
set
my
pulses
throbbing
with
delirious
delight
fancies
thick
as
leaves
in
summer
crowded
my
brain
earth
was
a
round
charm
hung
on
the
breast
of
a
smiling
divinity
men
were
gods
women
were
angels
the
world
seemed
but
a
wide
scroll
for
the
signatures
of
poets
and
mine
i
swore
should
be
clearly
written
he
paused
as
though
ashamed
of
his
own
fervor
and
glanced
at
heliobas
who
leaning
a
little
forward
in
his
chair
was
regaling
him
with
friendly
attentive
interest
then
he
continued
more
calmly
enough
i
think
i
had
something
in
me
then
something
that
was
new
and
wild
and
though
it
may
seem
self
praise
to
say
so
full
of
that
witching
glamour
we
name
inspiration
but
whatever
that
something
was
call
it
genius
a
trick
of
song
what
you
will
it
was
soon
crushed
out
of
me
the
world
is
fond
of
slaying
its
singing
buds
and
devouring
them
for
daily
fare
one
rough
pressure
of
finger
and
thumb
on
the
little
melodious
throats
and
they
are
mute
forever
so
i
found
when
at
last
in
mingled
pride
hope
and
fear
i
published
my
poems
seeking
for
them
no
other
recompense
save
fair
hearing
and
justice
they
obtained
neither
they
were
tossed
carelessly
by
a
few
critics
from
hand
to
hand
jeered
at
for
a
while
and
finally
flung
back
to
me
as
lies
lies
all
the
finely
spun
web
of
any
fancy
the
delicate
interwoven
intricacies
of
thought
these
were
torn
to
shreds
with
as
little
compunction
as
idle
children
feel
when
destroying
for
their
own
cruel
sport
the
velvety
wonder
of
a
moth
wing
or
the
radiant
rose
and
emerald
pinions
of
a
i
was
a
fool
so
i
was
told
with
many
a
languid
sneer
and
stale
jest
to
talk
of
hidden
mysteries
in
the
whisper
of
the
wind
and
the
dash
of
the
waves
such
sounds
were
but
common
cause
and
effect
the
stars
were
merely
conglomerated
masses
of
heated
vapor
condensed
by
the
work
of
ages
into
meteorites
and
from
meteorites
into
worlds
and
these
went
on
rolling
in
their
appointed
orbits
for
what
reason
nobody
knew
but
then
nobody
cared
and
love
the
of
the
theme
to
which
i
had
set
my
mistaken
life
in
tune
love
was
only
a
graceful
word
used
to
politely
define
the
low
but
very
general
sentiment
of
coarse
animal
attraction
in
short
poetry
such
as
mine
was
altogether
absurd
and
out
of
date
when
confronted
with
the
facts
of
existence
facts
which
plainly
taught
us
that
man
chief
business
here
below
was
simply
to
live
breed
and
die
the
life
of
a
or
caterpillar
on
a
slightly
higher
platform
of
ability
beyond
this
nothing
nothing
murmured
heliobas
in
a
tone
of
suggestive
inquiry
really
nothing
nothing
repeated
alwyn
with
an
air
of
resigned
hopelessness
for
i
learned
that
according
to
the
results
arrived
at
by
the
most
advanced
thinkers
of
the
day
there
was
no
god
no
soul
no
hereafter
the
loftiest
efforts
of
the
highest
heaven
aspiring
minds
were
doomed
to
end
in
failure
and
annihilation
among
all
the
desperately
hard
truths
that
came
rattling
down
upon
me
like
a
shower
of
stones
i
think
this
was
the
crowning
one
that
killed
whatever
genius
i
had
i
use
the
word
foolishly
though
after
all
genius
itself
is
nothing
to
boast
of
since
it
is
only
a
morbid
and
unhealthy
condition
of
the
intellectual
faculties
or
at
least
was
demonstrated
to
me
as
such
by
a
scientific
friend
of
my
own
who
seeing
i
was
miserable
took
great
pains
to
make
me
more
so
if
possible
he
proved
to
his
own
satisfaction
if
not
altogether
to
mine
that
the
abnormal
position
of
certain
molecules
in
the
brain
produced
an
eccentricity
or
peculiar
bias
in
one
direction
which
practically
viewed
might
be
described
as
an
intelligent
form
of
monomania
but
which
most
people
chose
to
term
and
that
from
a
purely
scientific
standpoint
it
was
evident
that
the
poets
painters
musicians
sculptors
and
all
the
widely
renowned
ones
of
the
earth
should
be
classified
as
so
many
brains
more
or
less
affected
by
abnormal
molecular
formation
which
strictly
speaking
amounted
to
he
assured
me
that
to
the
properly
balanced
healthily
organized
brain
of
the
human
animal
genius
was
an
impossibility
it
was
a
malady
as
unnatural
as
rare
it
is
singular
very
singular
he
added
with
a
complacent
smile
the
world
should
owe
all
its
finest
art
and
literature
merely
to
a
few
varieties
of
molecular
disease
i
thought
it
singular
enough
too
however
i
did
not
care
to
argue
with
him
i
only
felt
that
if
the
illness
of
genius
had
at
any
time
affected
me
it
was
pretty
well
certain
i
should
now
suffer
no
more
from
its
delicious
pangs
and
fever
i
was
cured
the
of
the
cynicism
had
found
its
way
to
the
musically
throbbing
centre
of
divine
disquietude
in
my
brain
and
had
there
cut
down
the
growth
of
fair
imaginations
for
ever
i
thrust
aside
the
bright
illusions
that
had
once
been
my
gladness
i
forced
myself
to
look
with
unflinching
eyes
at
the
wide
waste
of
universal
nothingness
revealed
to
me
by
the
rigid
positivists
and
iconoclasts
of
the
century
but
my
heart
died
within
me
my
whole
being
froze
as
it
were
into
an
icy
apathy
i
wrote
no
more
i
doubt
whether
i
shall
ever
write
again
of
a
truth
there
is
nothing
to
write
about
all
has
been
said
the
days
of
the
troubadours
are
past
one
can
not
string
canticles
of
love
for
men
and
women
whose
ruling
passion
is
the
greed
of
gold
yet
i
have
sometimes
thought
life
would
be
drearier
even
than
it
is
were
the
voices
of
poets
altogether
silent
and
i
wish
yes
i
wish
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
brand
my
on
the
brazen
face
of
this
coldly
callous
it
deep
in
those
letters
of
living
lire
called
fame
a
look
of
baffled
longing
and
un
gratified
ambition
came
into
his
musing
eyes
strong
shapely
white
hand
clenched
nervously
as
though
it
grasped
some
unseen
yet
perfectly
tangible
substance
just
then
the
storm
without
which
had
partially
lulled
during
the
last
few
minutes
began
its
wrath
anew
a
glare
of
lightning
blazed
against
the
uncurtained
window
and
a
heavy
clap
of
thunder
burst
overhead
with
the
sudden
crash
of
an
exploding
bomb
you
care
for
fame
asked
ileliobas
abruptly
as
soon
as
the
terrific
uproar
had
subsided
into
a
distant
dull
rumbling
mingled
with
the
pattering
dash
of
hail
i
care
for
it
yes
replied
alwyn
and
his
voice
was
very
low
and
dreamy
for
though
the
world
is
a
graveyard
as
i
have
said
full
of
unmarked
tombs
still
here
and
there
we
find
graves
such
as
or
byron
whereon
pale
flowers
like
sweet
suggestions
of
music
break
into
continuous
bloom
and
shall
i
not
win
my
own
of
asphodel
there
was
an
indescribable
almost
pathos
in
his
manner
of
uttering
these
last
words
a
hopelessness
of
effort
and
a
despairing
sense
of
failure
which
he
himself
seemed
conscious
of
for
meeting
the
fixed
and
earnest
gaze
of
ileliobas
he
quickly
relapsed
into
his
usual
tone
of
indolent
indifference
you
see
he
said
with
a
forced
smile
my
story
is
not
very
interesting
no
hairbreadth
escapes
no
thrilling
adventures
no
love
intrigues
nothing
but
mental
misery
for
which
few
people
have
any
sympathy
a
child
with
a
cut
finger
gets
more
universal
commiseration
than
a
man
with
a
tortured
brain
and
breaking
heart
yet
there
can
be
no
quotion
as
to
which
is
the
most
intense
duel
long
enduring
anguish
of
the
two
however
such
as
my
troubles
are
i
have
told
you
all
i
have
laid
bare
my
of
living
a
wound
that
throbs
and
burns
and
aches
more
intolerably
with
every
pissing
hour
and
day
it
is
not
unnatural
i
think
that
i
should
seek
for
a
little
cessation
of
suffering
a
brief
dreaming
space
in
which
to
rest
for
a
while
and
escape
from
the
deathful
truth
truth
that
like
the
flaming
sword
placed
east
of
the
fabled
garden
of
eden
turns
ruthlessly
every
way
keeping
us
out
of
the
forfeited
paradise
of
imaginative
aspiration
which
made
the
men
of
old
time
great
because
they
deemed
themselves
immortal
it
was
a
glorious
faith
that
strong
consciousness
that
in
the
change
and
upheaval
of
whole
universes
the
soul
of
man
should
forever
disaster
but
now
that
we
know
ourselves
to
be
of
no
more
importance
relatively
speaking
than
the
animalculae
in
a
drop
of
stagnant
water
what
great
works
can
be
done
what
noble
deeds
accomplished
in
the
face
of
the
declared
and
proved
futility
of
everything
still
if
you
can
as
you
say
liberate
me
from
this
fleshly
prison
and
give
me
new
sensations
and
different
experiences
why
then
let
me
depart
with
all
possible
speed
for
i
am
certain
i
shall
find
in
the
areas
of
space
nothing
worse
than
life
as
lived
in
this
present
world
remember
i
am
quite
incredulous
as
to
your
professed
power
he
paused
and
glanced
at
the
priestly
figure
opposite
then
added
lightly
but
i
am
curious
to
test
it
all
the
same
are
you
ready
to
being
your
spells
and
shall
i
say
the
nunc
dimittis
chapter
iii
departure
heliobas
was
silent
he
seemed
engaged
in
deep
and
anxious
thought
and
he
kept
his
steadfast
eyes
fixed
on
alwyn
countenance
as
though
he
sought
there
the
clew
to
some
difficult
problem
what
do
you
know
of
the
nunc
dimittis
he
asked
at
last
with
a
you
might
as
well
say
pater
noster
both
canticle
and
prayer
would
be
equally
unmeaning
to
you
for
poet
as
you
are
or
let
me
say
as
you
were
inasmuch
as
no
atheist
was
ever
a
poet
at
the
same
time
you
are
wrong
interrupted
alwyn
quickly
shelley
was
an
atheist
shelley
my
good
friend
was
not
an
atheist
footnote
see
the
last
two
verses
of
adonais
he
strove
to
be
one
nay
he
made
pretence
to
be
one
but
throughout
his
poems
we
hear
the
voice
of
his
inner
and
better
self
appealing
to
that
divinity
and
eternity
which
in
spite
of
the
material
part
of
him
he
instinctively
felt
existent
in
his
own
being
i
repeat
poet
as
your
were
and
poet
as
you
will
be
again
when
the
clouds
on
your
mind
are
cleared
you
present
the
strange
but
not
uncommon
spectacle
of
an
immortal
spirit
fighting
to
disprove
its
own
immortality
in
a
word
you
will
not
believe
in
the
soul
i
can
not
said
alwyn
with
a
hopeless
gesture
why
science
can
give
us
no
positive
proof
of
its
existence
it
can
not
be
defined
what
do
you
mean
by
science
demanded
heliobas
the
foot
of
the
mountain
at
which
men
now
stand
grovelling
and
uncertain
how
to
climb
or
the
glittering
summit
itself
which
touches
god
throne
alwyn
made
no
answer
tell
me
pursued
heliobas
how
do
you
define
the
vital
principle
what
mysterious
agency
sets
the
heart
beating
and
the
blood
flowing
by
the
small
porter
lantern
of
science
will
you
fling
a
light
on
the
dark
riddle
of
an
apparently
purposeless
universe
and
explain
to
me
why
we
live
at
all
evolution
responded
alwyn
shortly
and
necessity
evolution
from
what
persisted
heliobas
from
one
atom
what
atom
and
from
whence
came
the
atom
and
why
the
necessity
of
any
atom
the
human
brain
reels
at
such
questions
said
alwyn
vexedly
and
with
impatience
i
can
not
answer
them
no
one
can
no
one
heliobas
smiled
very
tranquilly
do
not
be
too
sure
of
that
and
why
should
the
human
brain
the
sagacious
calculating
clear
human
brain
that
never
gets
tired
or
puzzled
or
perplexed
that
settles
everything
in
the
most
practical
and
manner
and
disposes
of
god
altogether
as
an
extraneous
sort
of
bargain
not
wanted
in
the
general
economy
of
our
little
solar
system
aye
the
human
brain
is
a
wonderful
thing
and
yet
by
a
sharp
knock
with
this
and
he
took
up
from
the
table
a
with
a
massive
weighty
i
could
deaden
it
in
such
wise
that
the
soul
could
no
more
hold
any
communication
with
it
and
it
would
lie
an
inert
mass
in
the
cranium
of
no
more
use
to
its
owner
than
a
paralyzed
limb
you
mean
to
infer
that
the
brain
can
not
act
without
the
influence
of
the
soul
precisely
if
the
hands
on
the
telegraph
dial
will
not
respond
to
the
electric
battery
the
telegram
can
not
be
deciphered
but
it
would
be
foolish
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
electric
battery
because
the
dial
is
unsatisfactory
in
like
manner
when
by
physical
incapacity
or
inherited
disease
the
brain
can
no
longer
receive
the
impressions
or
electric
messages
of
the
spirit
it
is
practically
useless
yet
the
spirit
is
there
all
the
same
dumbly
waiting
for
release
and
another
chance
of
expansion
is
this
the
way
you
account
for
idiocy
and
mania
asked
alwyn
incredulously
most
certainly
idiocy
and
mania
always
come
from
man
interference
with
the
laws
of
health
and
of
nature
never
otherwise
the
soul
placed
within
us
by
the
creator
is
meant
to
be
fostered
by
man
unfettered
will
if
man
chooses
to
employ
that
unfettered
will
in
wrong
directions
he
has
only
himself
to
blame
for
the
disastrous
results
that
follow
you
may
perhaps
ask
why
god
has
thus
left
our
wills
unfettered
the
answer
is
simple
that
we
may
serve
him
by
choice
and
not
by
compulsion
among
the
myriad
million
worlds
that
acknowledge
his
goodness
gladly
and
undoubtingly
why
should
he
seek
to
force
unwilling
obedience
from
us
castaways
as
we
are
on
this
subject
said
alwyn
with
a
tinge
of
satire
in
his
tone
if
you
grant
a
god
and
make
him
out
to
be
supreme
love
why
in
the
name
of
his
supposed
inexhaustible
beneficence
should
we
be
castaways
at
all
because
in
our
overweening
pride
and
egotism
we
have
elected
to
be
such
replied
heliobas
as
angels
have
fallen
so
have
we
but
we
are
not
altogether
castaways
now
since
this
signal
and
he
touched
the
cross
on
his
breast
shone
in
heaven
alwyn
shrugged
his
shoulders
disdainfully
pardon
me
he
murmured
coldly
with
every
desire
to
respect
your
religious
scruples
i
really
can
not
personally
speaking
accept
the
tenets
of
a
faith
which
all
the
most
intellectual
minds
of
the
day
reject
as
mere
ignorant
superstition
the
carpenter
son
of
judea
was
no
doubt
a
very
estimable
person
a
socialist
teacher
whose
doctrines
were
very
excellent
in
theory
but
impossible
of
practice
that
there
was
anything
divine
about
him
i
utterly
deny
and
i
confess
i
am
surprised
that
you
a
man
of
evident
culture
do
not
seem
to
see
the
hollow
absurdity
of
christianity
as
a
system
of
morals
and
civilization
it
is
an
seed
of
discord
and
hatred
between
nations
it
has
served
as
a
casus
belli
of
the
most
fanatical
and
merciless
character
it
is
answerable
for
whole
seas
of
cruel
and
unnecessary
bloodshed
have
you
nothing
new
to
say
on
the
subject
interposed
heliobas
with
a
slight
smile
i
have
heard
all
this
so
often
before
from
divers
kinds
of
men
both
educated
and
ignorant
who
have
a
willful
habit
of
forgetting
all
that
christ
himself
prophesied
concerning
his
creed
of
so
difficult
to
selfish
humanity
not
that
i
come
to
send
peace
on
the
earth
i
come
not
to
send
peace
but
a
sword
again
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name
sake
ye
shall
be
offended
because
of
me
such
plain
words
as
these
seem
utterly
thrown
away
upon
this
present
generation
and
do
you
know
i
find
a
curious
lack
of
originality
among
in
fact
their
thoughts
can
hardly
be
designated
as
when
they
all
run
in
such
extremely
narrow
grooves
of
similitude
a
flock
of
sheep
mildly
trotting
under
the
guidance
of
the
butcher
to
the
slaughterhouse
could
not
be
more
tamely
alike
in
their
bleating
ignorance
as
to
where
they
are
going
your
opinions
for
instance
differ
scarce
a
whit
from
those
of
the
common
boor
who
reading
his
penny
radical
paper
thinks
he
can
dispense
with
god
and
talks
of
the
son
of
with
the
same
easy
flippancy
and
scant
reverence
as
yourself
the
minds
of
the
day
to
which
you
allude
are
extraordinarily
limited
of
comprehension
and
none
of
them
literary
or
otherwise
have
such
a
grasp
of
knowledge
as
any
of
these
dead
and
gone
authors
and
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
surrounding
loaded
bookshelves
who
lived
centuries
ago
and
are
now
as
far
as
the
general
public
is
concerned
forgotten
all
the
volumes
you
see
here
are
vellum
manuscripts
copied
from
the
original
slabs
of
baked
clay
stone
tablets
and
engraved
sheets
of
ivory
and
among
them
is
an
ingenious
treatise
by
one
remeni
adranos
chief
astronomer
to
the
then
king
of
babylonia
setting
forth
the
atom
and
evolution
theory
with
far
more
clearness
and
precision
than
any
of
your
modern
professors
all
such
propositions
are
old
old
as
the
hills
i
assure
you
and
these
days
in
which
you
live
are
more
suggestive
of
the
second
childhood
of
the
world
than
its
progressive
prime
especially
in
your
own
country
the
general
dotage
seems
to
have
reached
a
sort
of
climax
for
there
you
have
the
people
actually
forgetting
deriding
or
denying
their
greatest
men
who
form
the
only
lasting
glories
of
their
history
they
have
even
done
their
futile
best
to
tarnish
the
unsoilable
fame
of
shakespeare
in
that
land
you
who
according
to
your
own
showing
started
for
the
race
of
life
full
of
high
hopes
and
inspiration
to
still
higher
endeavor
you
have
been
poisoned
by
the
tainted
atmosphere
of
atheism
which
is
slowly
and
insidiously
spreading
itself
through
all
ranks
particularly
among
the
upper
classes
who
while
becoming
every
day
more
lax
in
their
morals
and
more
dissolute
of
behavior
consider
themselves
far
too
wise
and
cultured
to
believe
in
anything
it
is
a
most
unwholesome
atmosphere
charged
with
the
morbidities
and
microbes
of
national
disease
and
downfall
it
is
difficult
to
breathe
it
without
becoming
and
in
your
denial
of
the
divinity
of
christ
i
do
not
blame
you
any
more
than
i
would
blame
a
poor
creature
struck
down
by
a
plague
you
have
caught
the
negative
agnostic
and
atheistical
infection
from
others
it
is
not
the
natural
healthy
condition
of
your
temperament
on
the
contrary
it
is
so
far
as
that
point
goes
said
alwyn
with
sudden
heat
i
tell
you
i
am
amazed
utterly
amazed
that
you
with
your
intelligence
should
uphold
such
a
barbaric
idea
as
the
divinity
of
christ
human
reason
revolts
at
it
and
after
all
make
as
light
of
it
as
you
will
reason
is
the
only
thing
that
exalts
us
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
beasts
nay
the
beasts
share
the
gift
of
reason
in
common
with
us
replied
heliobas
and
man
only
proves
his
ignorance
if
he
denies
the
fact
often
indeed
the
very
insects
show
superior
reasoning
ability
to
ourselves
any
thoroughly
capable
naturalist
would
bear
me
out
in
this
assertion
well
well
and
alwyn
grew
impatient
reason
or
no
reason
i
again
repeat
that
the
legend
on
which
christianity
is
founded
is
absurd
and
preposterous
why
if
there
were
a
grain
of
truth
in
it
judas
iscariot
instead
of
being
universally
condemned
ought
to
be
honored
and
canonized
as
the
first
of
saints
must
i
remind
you
of
your
early
lesson
days
asked
heliobas
mildly
you
will
find
it
written
in
a
book
you
appear
to
have
forgotten
that
christ
expressly
prophesied
to
that
man
by
whom
he
was
betrayed
i
tell
you
little
as
you
credit
it
there
is
not
a
word
that
the
sinless
one
uttered
while
on
this
earth
that
has
not
been
or
shall
not
be
in
time
fulfilled
but
i
do
not
wish
to
enter
into
any
controversies
with
you
you
have
told
me
your
story
i
have
heard
it
with
interest
and
i
may
add
with
sympathy
you
are
a
poet
struck
dumb
by
materialism
because
you
lacked
strength
to
resist
the
shock
you
would
fain
recover
your
and
this
is
in
truth
the
reason
why
you
have
come
to
me
you
think
that
if
you
could
gain
some
of
the
strange
experiences
which
others
have
had
while
under
my
influence
you
might
win
back
your
lost
inspiration
though
you
do
not
know
why
you
think
this
neither
do
i
i
can
only
guess
and
your
guess
is
demanded
alwyn
with
an
air
of
affected
indifference
that
some
higher
influence
is
working
for
your
rescue
and
safety
replied
heliobas
what
influence
i
dare
not
presume
to
imagine
but
there
are
always
angels
near
angels
alwyn
laughed
aloud
how
many
more
fairy
tales
are
you
going
to
weave
for
me
out
of
your
fertile
oriental
imagination
angels
see
here
my
good
heliobas
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
grant
that
you
may
be
a
very
clever
man
with
an
odd
prejudice
in
favor
of
christianity
but
i
must
request
that
you
will
not
talk
to
me
of
angels
and
spirits
or
any
such
nonsense
as
if
i
were
a
child
waiting
to
be
amused
instead
of
a
man
with
with
so
an
intellect
that
it
has
god
finished
heliobas
serenely
quite
so
yet
angels
after
all
are
only
immortal
souls
such
as
yours
or
mine
when
set
free
of
their
earthly
tenements
for
instance
when
i
look
at
you
thus
and
he
raised
his
eyes
with
a
lustrous
piercing
glance
i
see
the
proud
strong
and
rebellious
angel
in
you
far
more
distinctly
than
your
outward
shape
of
man
and
you
when
you
look
at
me
he
broke
off
for
alwyn
at
that
moment
sprang
from
his
chair
and
staring
fixedly
at
him
uttered
a
quick
fierce
exclamation
ah
i
know
you
now
he
cried
in
sudden
and
extraordinary
excitement
i
know
you
well
we
have
met
before
why
after
all
that
has
passed
do
we
meet
again
this
singular
speech
was
accompanied
by
a
still
more
singular
transfiguration
of
countenance
a
dark
fiery
glory
burned
in
his
eyes
and
in
the
stern
frowning
wonder
and
defiance
of
his
expression
and
attitude
there
was
something
grand
yet
terrible
menacing
yet
supernaturally
sublime
he
stood
so
for
an
instant
space
majestically
sombre
like
some
haughty
discrowned
emperor
confronting
his
conqueror
a
rumbling
roll
of
thunder
outside
seemed
to
recall
him
to
himself
and
he
pressed
his
hand
tightly
down
over
his
eyelids
as
though
to
shut
out
some
overwhelming
vision
after
a
pause
he
looked
up
again
wildly
confusedly
almost
beseechingly
and
heliobas
observing
this
rose
and
advanced
toward
him
peace
he
said
in
low
impressive
tones
we
have
recognized
each
other
but
on
earth
such
recognitions
are
brief
and
soon
forgotten
he
waited
for
a
few
seconds
then
resumed
lightly
come
look
at
me
now
what
do
you
see
nothing
but
yourself
he
replied
sighing
deeply
as
he
spoke
yet
oddly
enough
a
moment
ago
i
fancied
you
had
altogether
a
different
appearance
and
i
thought
i
saw
no
matter
what
i
can
not
describe
it
his
brows
contracted
in
a
puzzled
line
it
was
a
curious
phenomenon
very
curious
and
it
affected
me
strangely
he
stopped
abruptly
then
added
with
a
slight
flush
of
annoyance
on
his
face
i
perceive
you
are
an
adept
in
the
art
of
optical
illusion
heliobas
laughed
softly
of
course
what
else
can
you
expect
of
a
charlatan
a
trickster
and
a
monk
to
boot
deception
deception
throughout
my
dear
sir
and
have
you
not
asked
to
be
deceived
there
was
a
fine
scarcely
perceptible
satire
in
his
manner
he
glanced
at
the
tall
oaken
clock
that
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
room
its
hands
pointed
to
eleven
now
alwyn
he
went
on
i
think
we
have
talked
quite
enough
for
this
evening
and
my
advice
is
that
you
retire
to
rest
and
think
over
what
i
have
said
to
you
i
am
willing
to
help
you
if
i
can
but
with
your
beliefs
or
rather
your
i
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
you
frankly
that
the
exertion
of
my
internal
force
upon
yours
in
your
present
condition
might
be
fraught
with
extreme
danger
and
suffering
you
have
spoken
of
truth
deathful
truth
this
being
however
nothing
but
truth
according
to
the
opinion
which
changes
with
every
passing
generation
and
therefore
is
not
truth
at
all
there
is
another
truth
the
everlasting
truth
the
pivot
of
all
life
which
never
changes
and
it
is
with
this
alone
that
my
science
deals
were
i
to
set
you
at
liberty
as
you
desire
were
your
intelligence
too
suddenly
awakened
to
the
blinding
awfulness
of
your
mistaken
notions
of
life
death
and
futurity
the
result
might
be
more
overpowering
than
either
you
or
i
can
imagine
i
have
told
you
what
i
can
do
your
incredulity
does
not
alter
the
fact
of
my
capacity
i
can
sever
you
that
is
your
soul
which
you
can
not
define
but
which
nevertheless
exists
from
your
body
like
a
moth
from
its
chrysalis
but
i
dare
not
even
picture
to
myself
what
scorching
flame
the
moth
might
not
heedlessly
fly
into
you
might
in
your
temporary
state
of
release
find
that
new
impetus
to
your
thoughts
you
so
ardently
desire
or
you
might
not
in
short
it
is
impossible
to
form
a
guess
as
to
whether
your
experience
might
be
one
of
supernal
ecstasy
or
inconceivable
horror
he
paused
a
moment
alwyn
was
watching
him
with
a
close
intentness
that
bordered
on
fascination
and
presently
he
continued
it
is
best
from
all
points
of
view
that
you
should
consider
the
matter
more
thoroughly
than
you
have
yet
done
think
it
over
well
and
carefully
until
this
time
then
if
you
are
quite
resolved
i
am
resolved
now
said
alwyn
slowly
and
determinately
if
you
are
so
certain
of
your
influence
come
unbar
my
chains
open
the
let
me
go
hence
there
is
no
time
like
the
present
to
night
and
heliobas
turned
his
keen
bright
eyes
full
upon
him
with
a
look
of
amazement
and
reproach
to
night
without
faith
preparation
or
prayer
you
are
willing
to
be
tossed
through
the
realms
of
space
like
a
grain
of
dust
in
a
whirling
tempest
beyond
the
glittering
gyration
of
unnumbered
stars
through
the
flash
of
streaming
comets
through
darkness
through
light
through
depths
of
profoundest
silence
over
heights
of
vibrating
sound
you
you
will
dare
to
wander
in
these
regions
you
a
blasphemer
and
a
doubter
of
god
his
voice
thrilled
with
passion
his
aspect
was
so
solemn
and
earnest
and
imposing
that
alwyn
awed
and
startled
remained
for
a
moment
mute
then
lifting
his
head
proudly
answered
yes
i
dare
if
i
am
immortal
i
will
test
my
immortality
i
will
face
god
and
find
these
angels
you
talk
about
what
shall
prevent
me
find
the
angels
heliobas
surveyed
him
sadly
as
he
spoke
nay
pray
rather
that
they
may
find
thee
he
looked
long
and
steadfastly
at
alwyn
countenance
on
which
there
was
just
then
the
faint
glimmer
of
a
rather
mocking
smile
and
as
he
looked
his
own
face
darkened
suddenly
into
an
expression
of
vague
trouble
and
uneasiness
and
a
strange
quiver
passed
visibly
through
him
from
head
to
foot
you
are
bold
alwyn
he
said
at
last
moving
a
little
away
from
his
guest
and
speaking
with
some
apparent
effort
bold
to
a
fault
but
at
the
same
time
you
are
ignorant
of
all
that
lies
behind
the
veil
of
the
unseen
i
should
be
much
to
blame
if
i
sent
you
hence
utterly
unguided
utterly
uninstructed
i
myself
must
think
and
pray
before
i
venture
to
incur
so
terrible
a
responsibility
perhaps
no
i
can
not
moreover
i
will
not
alwyn
flushed
hotly
with
anger
trickster
he
thought
he
feels
he
has
no
power
over
me
and
he
fears
to
run
the
risk
of
failure
did
i
hear
you
aright
he
said
aloud
in
cold
determined
accents
you
can
not
you
will
not
by
heaven
and
his
voice
rose
i
say
you
shall
as
he
uttered
these
words
a
rush
of
indescribable
sensations
overcame
him
he
seemed
all
at
once
invested
with
some
mysterious
invincible
supreme
authority
he
felt
twice
a
man
and
more
than
half
a
god
and
moved
by
an
irresistible
impulse
which
he
could
neither
explain
nor
control
he
made
two
or
three
hasty
steps
forward
when
heliobas
swiftly
retreating
waved
him
off
with
an
eloquent
gesture
of
mingled
appeal
and
menace
back
back
he
cried
warningly
if
you
come
one
inch
nearer
to
me
i
can
not
answer
for
your
safety
back
i
say
good
god
you
do
not
know
your
own
power
alwyn
scarcely
heeded
him
some
fatal
attraction
drew
him
on
and
he
still
advanced
when
all
suddenly
he
paused
trembling
violently
his
nerves
began
to
throb
acutely
the
blood
in
his
veins
was
like
fire
there
was
a
curious
strangling
tightness
in
his
throat
that
interrupted
and
oppressed
his
breathing
he
stared
straight
before
him
with
large
luminous
impassioned
eyes
what
what
was
that
dazzling
something
in
the
air
that
flashed
and
whirled
and
shone
like
glittering
wheels
of
golden
flame
his
lips
parted
he
stretched
out
his
hands
in
the
uncertain
manner
of
a
blind
man
feeling
his
way
oh
god
god
he
muttered
as
though
stricken
by
some
sudden
amazement
then
with
a
smothered
gasping
cry
he
staggered
and
fell
heavily
forward
on
the
floor
insensible
at
the
instant
the
window
blew
open
with
a
loud
crash
it
swung
backward
and
forward
on
its
hinges
and
a
torrent
of
rain
poured
through
it
slantwise
into
the
room
a
remarkable
change
had
taken
place
in
the
aspect
and
bearing
of
heliobas
he
stood
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
trembling
from
head
to
foot
he
had
lost
all
his
usual
composure
he
was
deathly
pale
and
breathed
with
difficulty
presently
recovering
himself
a
little
he
strove
to
shut
the
swinging
casement
but
the
wind
was
so
boisterous
that
he
had
to
pause
a
moment
to
gain
strength
for
the
effort
and
instinctively
he
glanced
out
at
the
tempestuous
night
the
clouds
were
scurrying
over
the
sky
like
great
black
vessels
on
a
foaming
sea
the
lightning
flashed
incessantly
and
the
thunder
reverberated
over
the
mountains
in
tremendous
volleys
as
of
besieging
cannon
stinging
drops
of
icy
sleet
dashed
his
face
and
the
front
of
his
white
garb
as
he
inhaled
the
stormy
freshness
of
the
strong
blast
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
with
the
air
of
one
gathering
together
all
his
scattered
forces
he
shut
to
the
window
firmly
and
barred
it
across
turning
now
to
the
unconscious
alwyn
he
lifted
him
from
the
floor
to
a
low
couch
near
at
hand
and
there
laid
him
gently
down
this
done
he
stood
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
the
deepest
anxiety
but
made
no
attempt
to
rouse
him
from
his
swoon
his
own
habitual
serenity
was
completely
broken
through
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
having
received
some
unexpected
and
overwhelming
shock
his
very
lips
were
blanched
and
quivered
nervously
he
waited
for
several
minutes
attentively
watching
the
recumbent
figure
before
him
till
gradually
very
gradually
that
figure
took
upon
itself
the
pale
stern
beauty
of
a
corpse
from
which
life
has
but
recently
and
painlessly
departed
the
limbs
grew
stiff
and
rigid
the
features
smoothed
into
that
mysteriously
wise
placidity
which
is
so
often
seen
in
the
faces
of
the
dead
the
closed
eyelids
looked
purple
and
livid
as
though
bruised
there
was
not
a
breath
not
a
tremor
to
offer
any
outward
suggestion
of
returning
animation
and
when
after
some
little
time
heliobas
bent
down
and
listened
there
was
no
pulsation
of
the
heart
it
had
ceased
to
beat
to
all
appearances
alwyn
was
dead
any
physician
would
have
certified
the
fact
though
how
he
had
come
by
his
death
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
and
in
that
condition
stirless
breathless
white
as
marble
cold
and
inanimate
as
stone
heliobas
left
him
not
in
indifference
but
in
sure
knowledge
knowledge
far
beyond
all
mere
medical
science
that
the
senseless
clay
would
in
due
time
again
arise
to
life
and
motion
that
the
casket
was
but
temporarily
bereft
of
its
jewel
and
that
the
jewel
itself
the
soul
of
the
poet
had
by
a
superhuman
access
of
will
managed
to
break
its
bonds
and
escape
elsewhere
but
whither
into
what
vast
realms
of
translucent
light
or
drear
shadow
this
was
a
question
to
which
the
mystic
monk
gifted
as
he
was
with
a
powerful
spiritual
insight
into
things
unseen
and
eternal
could
find
no
satisfactory
answer
and
in
his
anxious
perplexity
he
betook
himself
to
the
chapel
and
there
by
the
red
glimmer
of
the
crimson
star
that
shone
dimly
above
the
altar
he
knelt
alone
and
prayed
in
silence
till
the
heavy
night
had
passed
and
the
storm
had
slain
itself
with
the
sword
of
its
own
fury
on
the
dark
slopes
of
the
pass
of
dariel
chapter
iv
angelus
domine
the
next
morning
dawned
pallidly
over
a
sea
of
gray
mist
not
a
glimpse
of
the
landscape
was
visible
nothing
but
a
shadowy
vastness
of
floating
vapor
that
moved
slowly
fold
upon
fold
wave
upon
wave
as
though
bent
on
blotting
out
the
world
a
very
faint
chill
light
peered
through
the
narrow
arched
window
of
the
room
where
alwyn
lay
still
wrapped
in
that
profound
repose
so
like
the
last
long
sleep
from
which
some
of
our
modern
scientists
tell
us
there
can
be
no
awakening
his
condition
was
unchanged
the
wan
beams
of
the
early
clay
falling
cross
his
features
intensified
their
waxen
stillness
and
pallor
the
awful
majesty
of
death
was
on
him
the
pathetic
helplessness
and
perishableness
of
body
without
spirit
presently
the
monastery
bell
began
to
ring
for
matins
and
as
its
clear
chime
struck
through
the
deep
silence
the
door
opened
and
heliobas
accompanied
by
another
monk
whose
gentle
countenance
and
fine
soft
eyes
betokened
the
serenity
of
his
disposition
entered
the
apartment
together
they
approached
the
couch
and
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
the
supernaturally
slumbering
man
he
is
still
far
away
said
heliobas
at
last
sighing
as
he
spoke
so
far
away
that
my
mind
misgives
me
alas
hilarion
how
limited
is
our
knowledge
even
with
all
the
spiritual
aids
of
spiritual
life
how
little
can
be
accomplished
we
learn
one
thing
and
another
presents
itself
we
conquer
one
difficulty
and
another
instantly
springs
up
to
obstruct
our
path
now
if
i
had
only
had
the
innate
perception
required
to
foresee
the
possible
flight
of
this
released
immortal
creature
might
i
not
have
saved
it
from
some
incalculable
misery
and
suffering
i
think
not
answered
in
rather
musing
accents
the
monk
called
hilarion
i
think
not
such
protection
can
never
be
exercised
by
mere
human
intelligence
if
this
soul
is
to
be
saved
or
shielded
in
its
invisible
journeying
it
will
be
by
some
means
that
not
all
the
marvels
of
our
science
can
calculate
you
say
he
was
without
faith
entirely
what
was
his
leading
principle
a
desire
for
what
he
called
truth
replied
heliobas
he
like
many
others
of
his
class
never
took
the
trouble
to
consider
very
deeply
the
inner
meaning
of
pilate
famous
question
is
truth
we
know
what
it
is
as
generally
accepted
a
few
so
called
facts
which
in
a
thousand
years
will
all
be
contradicted
mixed
up
with
a
few
finite
opinions
propounded
by
unstable
minded
men
in
brief
truth
according
to
the
world
is
simply
whatever
the
world
is
pleased
to
consider
as
truth
for
the
time
being
is
a
somewhat
slight
thing
to
stake
one
immortal
destinies
upon
hilarion
raised
one
of
alwyn
cold
pulseless
hands
it
was
stiff
and
white
as
marble
i
suppose
he
said
there
is
no
doubt
of
his
returning
hither
none
whatever
answered
heliobas
decisively
his
life
on
earth
is
assured
for
many
years
yet
inasmuch
as
his
penance
is
not
finished
his
recompense
not
won
thus
far
my
knowledge
of
his
fate
is
certain
then
you
will
bring
him
back
pursued
hilarion
bring
him
back
i
i
can
not
said
heliobas
with
a
touch
of
sad
humility
in
his
tone
and
for
this
very
reason
i
feared
to
send
him
hence
and
would
not
have
done
so
not
without
preparation
at
any
rate
could
i
have
had
my
way
his
departure
was
more
strange
than
any
i
have
ever
known
moreover
it
was
his
own
doing
not
mine
i
had
positively
refused
to
exert
my
influence
upon
him
because
i
felt
he
was
not
in
my
sphere
and
that
therefore
neither
i
nor
any
of
those
higher
intelligences
with
which
i
am
in
communication
could
control
or
guide
his
wanderings
he
however
was
as
positively
determined
that
i
should
exert
it
and
to
this
end
he
suddenly
concentrated
all
the
pent
up
fire
of
his
nature
in
one
rapid
effort
of
will
and
advanced
upon
me
i
warned
him
but
in
vain
quick
as
lightning
flash
meets
lightning
flash
the
two
invisible
immortal
forces
within
us
sprang
into
instant
opposition
with
this
difference
that
while
he
was
ignorant
and
unconscious
of
his
power
i
was
cognizant
and
fully
conscious
of
mine
mine
was
focused
as
it
were
upon
him
his
was
untrained
and
scattered
the
result
was
that
mine
won
the
victory
yet
understand
me
well
hilarion
if
i
could
have
held
myself
in
i
would
have
done
so
it
was
he
he
who
drew
my
force
out
of
me
as
one
would
draw
a
sword
out
of
its
scabbard
the
sword
may
be
ever
so
stiffly
fixed
in
its
sheath
but
the
strong
hand
will
wrench
it
forth
somehow
and
use
it
for
battle
when
needed
then
said
hilarion
wonderingly
you
admit
this
man
possesses
a
power
greater
than
your
own
aye
if
he
knew
it
returned
heliobas
quietly
but
he
does
not
know
only
an
angel
could
teach
him
and
in
angels
he
does
not
believe
he
may
believe
now
he
may
he
will
he
must
if
he
has
gone
where
i
would
have
him
go
a
poet
is
he
not
queried
hilarion
softly
bending
down
to
look
more
attentively
at
the
beautiful
face
colorless
and
cold
as
sculptured
alabaster
an
uncrowned
monarch
of
a
world
of
song
responded
heliobas
with
a
tender
inflection
in
his
rich
voice
a
genius
such
as
the
earth
sees
but
once
in
a
century
but
he
has
been
smitten
with
the
disease
of
unbelief
and
deprived
of
hope
and
where
there
is
no
hope
there
is
no
lasting
accomplishment
he
paused
and
with
a
touch
as
gentle
as
a
woman
rearranged
the
cushions
under
alwyn
heavy
head
and
laid
his
hand
in
grave
benediction
on
the
broad
white
brow
shaded
by
its
clustering
waves
of
dark
hair
may
the
infinite
love
bring
him
out
of
danger
into
peace
and
safety
he
said
solemnly
then
turning
away
he
took
his
companion
by
the
arm
and
they
both
left
the
room
closing
the
door
quietly
behind
them
the
chapel
bell
went
on
tolling
slowly
slowly
sending
muffled
echoes
through
the
fog
for
some
minutes
then
it
ceased
and
profound
stillness
reigned
the
monastery
was
always
a
very
silent
habitation
situated
as
it
was
on
so
lofty
and
barren
a
crag
it
was
far
beyond
the
of
the
smaller
birds
now
and
then
an
eagle
clove
the
mist
with
a
whirr
of
wings
and
a
discordant
scream
on
his
way
toward
some
distant
mountain
eyrie
but
no
other
sound
of
awakening
life
broke
the
hush
of
the
slowly
widening
dawn
an
hour
passed
and
alwyn
still
remained
in
the
same
position
as
pallidly
quiescent
as
a
corpse
stretched
out
for
burial
by
and
by
a
change
begin
to
thrill
mysteriously
through
the
atmosphere
like
the
flowing
of
amber
wine
through
crystal
the
heavy
vapors
shuddered
together
as
though
suddenly
lashed
by
a
whip
of
flame
they
rose
swayed
to
and
fro
and
parted
asunder
then
dissolving
into
thin
veils
of
fleecy
film
they
floated
away
disclosing
as
they
vanished
the
giant
summits
of
the
encircling
mountains
that
lifted
themselves
to
the
light
one
above
another
in
the
form
of
frozen
billows
over
these
a
delicate
pink
flush
flitted
in
tremulous
wavy
lines
long
arrows
of
gold
began
to
pierce
the
tender
shimmering
blue
of
the
sky
soft
puffs
of
cloud
tinged
with
vivid
crimson
and
pale
green
were
strewn
along
the
eastern
horizon
like
flowers
in
the
path
of
an
advancing
hero
and
then
all
at
once
there
was
a
slight
cessation
of
movement
in
the
heavens
an
attentive
pause
as
though
the
whole
universe
waited
for
some
great
splendor
as
yet
unrevealed
that
splendor
came
in
a
red
blaze
of
triumph
the
sun
rose
pouring
a
shower
of
beamy
brilliancy
over
the
white
vastness
of
the
heights
covered
with
perpetual
snow
jagged
peaks
sharp
as
scimetars
and
sparkling
with
ice
caught
fire
and
seemed
to
melt
away
in
an
absorbing
sea
of
radiance
the
waiting
clouds
moved
on
redecked
in
deeper
hues
of
royal
purple
and
the
full
morning
glory
was
declared
as
the
dazzling
effulgence
streamed
through
the
window
and
flooded
the
couch
where
alwyn
lay
a
faint
tinge
of
color
returned
to
his
face
his
lips
moved
his
broad
chest
heaved
with
struggling
sighs
his
eyelids
quivered
and
his
before
rigid
hands
relaxed
and
folded
themselves
together
in
an
attitude
of
peace
and
prayer
like
a
statue
becoming
slowly
and
magically
flushed
with
life
the
warm
hues
of
the
naturally
flowing
blood
deepened
through
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
his
breathing
grew
more
and
more
easy
and
regular
his
features
gradually
assumed
their
wonted
appearance
and
presently
without
any
violent
start
or
exclamation
he
awoke
but
was
it
a
real
awakening
or
rather
a
continuation
of
some
strange
impression
received
in
slumber
he
rose
to
his
feet
pushing
back
the
hair
from
his
brow
with
an
entranced
look
of
listening
wonderment
his
eyes
were
humid
yet
brilliant
his
whole
aspect
was
that
of
one
inspired
he
paced
once
or
twice
up
and
down
the
room
but
he
was
evidently
unconscious
of
his
surroundings
he
seemed
possessed
by
thoughts
which
absorbed
his
whole
being
presently
he
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
absently
fingering
the
writing
materials
that
were
upon
it
he
appeared
meditatively
to
question
their
use
and
meaning
then
drawing
several
sheets
of
paper
toward
him
he
began
to
write
with
extraordinary
rapidity
and
eagerness
his
pen
travelled
on
smoothly
uninterrupted
by
blot
or
erasure
sometimes
he
paused
but
when
he
did
it
was
always
with
an
upraised
attentively
listening
expression
once
he
murmured
aloud
ardath
nay
i
shall
not
forget
we
will
meet
at
ardath
and
again
he
resumed
his
occupation
page
after
page
he
covered
with
close
weak
uncertain
scrawl
but
a
firm
bold
neat
caligraphy
his
own
peculiar
characteristic
hand
the
sun
mounted
higher
and
higher
in
the
heavens
hour
after
hour
passed
and
still
lie
wrote
on
apparently
unaware
of
the
flitting
time
at
the
bell
which
had
not
rung
since
early
dawn
began
to
swing
quickly
to
and
fro
in
the
chapel
turret
the
deep
bass
of
the
organ
breathed
on
the
silence
a
thunderous
monotone
and
a
murmur
of
distant
voices
proclaimed
the
words
angelas
domine
nuntiavit
mariae
at
the
first
sound
of
this
chant
the
spell
that
enchained
alwyn
mind
was
broken
drawing
a
quick
dashing
line
under
what
he
had
written
he
sprang
up
erect
and
dropped
his
pen
heliobas
he
cried
loudly
heliobas
where
is
the
field
of
ardath
his
voice
seemed
strange
and
unfamiliar
to
his
own
ears
he
waited
listening
and
the
chant
went
on
et
verbo
caro
factus
est
et
habitavit
in
nobis
suddenly
as
if
he
could
endure
his
solitude
no
longer
he
rushed
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
thereby
nearly
flinging
himself
against
heliobas
who
was
entering
the
room
at
the
same
moment
he
drew
back
stared
wildly
and
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
confusedly
forced
a
laugh
i
have
been
dreaming
he
said
then
with
a
passionate
gesture
he
added
god
if
the
dream
were
true
he
was
strongly
excited
and
heliobas
slipping
one
arm
round
him
in
a
friendly
manner
led
him
back
to
the
chair
he
had
vacated
observing
him
closely
as
he
did
so
you
call
this
dreaming
he
inquired
with
a
slight
smile
pointing
to
the
table
strewn
with
manuscript
on
which
the
ink
was
not
yet
dry
then
dreams
are
more
productive
than
active
exertion
here
is
goodly
matter
for
printers
a
fair
result
it
seems
of
one
morning
labor
alwyn
started
up
seized
the
written
sheets
and
scanned
them
eagerly
it
is
my
handwriting
he
muttered
in
a
tone
of
stupefied
amazement
of
course
whose
handwriting
should
it
be
returned
heliobas
watching
him
with
scientifically
keen
yet
kindly
interest
then
it
is
true
he
exclaimed
true
by
the
sweetness
of
her
eyes
true
by
the
radiance
of
her
smile
true
o
thou
god
whom
i
dared
to
doubt
true
by
the
marvels
of
thy
matchless
wisdom
and
with
this
strange
outburst
he
began
to
read
in
feverish
haste
what
he
had
written
his
breath
came
and
went
quickly
his
cheeks
flushed
his
eyes
dilated
line
after
line
he
perused
with
apparent
wonder
and
rapture
when
suddenly
interrupting
himself
he
raised
his
head
and
recited
in
a
half
whisper
with
thundering
notes
of
song
sublime
i
cast
my
sins
away
from
me
on
stairs
of
sound
i
mount
i
climb
the
angels
wait
and
pray
for
me
i
heard
that
stanza
somewhere
when
i
was
a
boy
why
do
i
think
of
it
now
she
has
waited
so
she
said
these
many
thousand
days
he
paused
meditatively
and
then
resumed
his
reading
heliobas
touched
his
arm
it
will
take
you
some
time
to
read
that
alwyn
he
gently
observed
you
have
written
more
than
you
know
alwyn
roused
himself
and
looked
straight
at
the
speaker
putting
down
his
manuscript
and
resting
one
hand
upon
it
he
gazed
with
an
air
of
solemn
inquiry
into
the
noble
face
turned
steadfastly
toward
his
own
tell
me
he
said
wistfully
how
has
it
happened
this
composition
is
mine
and
yet
not
mine
for
it
is
a
grand
and
perfect
poem
of
which
i
dare
not
call
myself
the
author
i
might
as
well
snatch
her
crown
of
starry
flowers
and
call
myself
an
angel
he
spoke
with
mingled
fervor
and
humility
to
any
ordinary
observer
he
would
have
seemed
to
be
laboring
under
home
strange
hallucination
but
heliobas
was
more
deeply
instructed
come
come
your
thoughts
are
wide
of
this
world
he
said
kindly
try
to
recall
them
i
can
tell
you
nothing
for
i
know
nothing
you
have
been
absent
many
hours
absent
yes
and
alwyn
voice
thrilled
with
an
infinite
regret
absent
from
ah
would
to
god
i
might
hive
stayed
with
her
in
heaven
my
love
my
love
where
shal
i
find
her
if
not
in
the
field
of
ardath
chapter
a
mystic
tryst
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
his
eyes
darkened
into
a
soft
expression
of
musing
tenderness
and
he
remained
silent
for
many
minutes
during
which
the
entranced
almost
unearthly
beauty
of
his
face
underwent
a
gradual
change
the
mystic
light
that
had
for
a
time
transfigured
it
faded
and
died
away
and
by
degrees
he
recovered
all
his
ordinary
self
possession
presently
glancing
at
heliobas
who
stood
patiently
waiting
till
he
should
have
overcome
whatever
emotions
were
at
work
in
his
mind
he
smiled
you
must
think
me
mad
he
said
perhaps
i
am
but
if
so
it
is
the
madness
of
love
that
has
seized
me
love
it
is
a
passion
i
have
never
known
i
have
used
it
as
a
mere
thread
whereon
to
string
madrigals
a
background
of
uncertain
tint
serving
to
show
off
the
brighter
lines
of
poesy
but
now
now
i
am
enslaved
and
bound
conquered
and
utterly
subdued
by
love
love
for
the
sweetest
queenliest
most
radiant
creature
that
ever
captured
or
commanded
the
worship
of
man
i
may
seem
mad
but
i
know
i
am
sane
i
realize
the
actual
things
of
this
world
about
me
mind
is
my
clear
my
thoughts
are
collected
and
yet
i
repeat
i
love
aye
with
all
the
force
and
fervor
of
this
strongly
beating
human
heart
of
mine
and
he
touched
his
breast
as
he
spoke
and
it
comes
to
this
most
wise
and
worthy
heliobas
if
your
spells
have
conjured
up
this
vision
of
immortal
youth
and
grace
and
purity
that
has
suddenly
assumed
such
sovereignty
over
my
life
then
you
must
do
something
further
you
must
find
or
teach
me
how
to
find
the
living
reality
of
my
dream
heliobas
surveyed
him
with
some
wonder
and
commiseration
a
moment
ago
and
you
yourself
declared
your
dream
was
true
he
observed
this
and
he
pointed
to
the
manuscript
on
the
table
seemed
to
you
sufficient
to
prove
it
now
you
have
altered
you
opinion
why
i
have
worked
no
spells
upon
you
and
i
am
entirely
ignorant
as
to
what
your
recent
experience
has
been
moreover
what
do
you
mean
by
a
reality
the
flesh
and
blood
bone
and
substance
that
perishes
in
a
brief
seventy
years
or
so
and
crumbles
into
indistinguishable
dust
surely
if
as
i
conjecture
from
your
words
you
have
seen
one
of
the
fair
inhabitants
of
higher
spheres
than
ours
you
would
not
drag
her
spiritual
and
death
unconscious
brightness
down
to
the
level
of
the
of
a
merely
human
life
nay
if
you
would
you
could
not
alwyn
looked
at
him
inquiringly
and
with
a
perplexed
air
you
speak
in
enigmas
he
said
somewhat
vexedly
however
the
whole
thing
is
an
enigma
and
would
puzzle
the
most
sagacious
head
that
the
physicial
workings
of
the
brain
in
a
site
of
trance
should
arouse
in
me
a
passion
of
love
for
an
imaginary
being
and
at
the
same
time
enable
to
write
a
poem
such
as
must
make
the
fame
of
any
man
is
certainly
a
remarkable
and
noteworthy
result
of
scientific
mesmerism
now
my
dear
sir
interrupted
heliobas
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
do
not
if
you
have
any
respect
for
science
at
all
do
not
i
beg
of
you
talk
to
me
of
the
workings
of
a
dead
brain
a
dead
brain
echoed
alwyn
what
do
you
mean
what
i
say
returned
heliobas
composedly
workings
of
any
kind
are
impossible
unless
the
motive
power
of
physical
life
be
in
action
you
regarded
as
a
human
creature
merely
had
during
seven
hours
practically
ceased
to
be
the
vital
principle
no
longer
existed
in
your
body
having
taken
its
departure
together
with
its
inseparable
companion
the
soul
when
it
returned
it
set
the
clockwork
of
your
material
mechanism
in
motion
again
obeying
the
sovereignty
of
the
spirit
that
sought
to
express
by
material
means
the
utterance
of
thought
thus
your
hand
mechanically
found
its
way
to
the
pen
thus
you
wrote
unconscious
of
what
you
were
writing
yielding
yourself
entirely
to
the
guidance
of
the
spiritual
part
of
your
nature
which
at
that
particular
juncture
was
absolutely
predominant
though
now
weighted
anew
by
earthy
influences
it
has
partially
relaxed
its
supernal
sway
all
this
i
readily
perceive
and
understand
but
what
you
did
and
where
you
were
conducted
during
the
time
of
your
complete
severance
from
the
tenement
of
clay
in
which
you
are
again
imprisoned
this
i
have
yet
to
learn
while
heliobas
was
speaking
alwyn
countenance
had
grown
vaguely
troubled
and
now
into
his
deep
poetic
eyes
there
came
a
look
of
sudden
penitence
true
he
said
softly
almost
humbly
i
will
tell
you
everything
while
i
remember
it
though
it
is
not
likely
i
shall
ever
forget
i
believe
there
must
be
some
truth
after
all
in
what
you
say
concerning
the
soul
at
any
rate
i
do
not
at
present
feel
inclined
to
call
your
theories
in
question
to
begin
with
i
find
myself
unable
altogether
to
explain
what
it
was
that
happened
to
me
during
my
conversation
with
you
last
night
it
was
a
very
strange
sensation
i
recollect
that
i
had
expressed
a
wish
to
be
placed
under
your
magnetic
or
electric
influence
and
that
you
had
refused
my
request
then
an
odd
idea
suggested
itself
to
me
namely
that
i
could
if
i
chose
compel
your
assent
and
filled
with
this
notion
i
think
i
addressed
you
or
was
about
to
address
you
in
a
rather
peremptory
manner
when
all
at
once
a
flash
of
blinding
light
struck
me
fiercely
across
the
eyes
like
a
scourge
stung
with
the
hot
pain
and
dazzled
by
the
glare
i
turned
away
from
you
and
fled
or
so
it
seemed
fled
on
my
own
instinctive
impulse
into
darkness
he
paused
and
drew
a
long
shuddering
breath
like
one
who
has
narrowly
escaped
imminent
destruction
darkness
he
went
on
in
low
accents
that
thrilled
with
the
memory
of
a
past
feat
dense
horrible
frightful
darkness
darkness
that
palpitated
heavily
with
the
labored
motion
of
unseen
things
darkness
that
clung
and
closed
about
me
in
masses
of
clammy
tangible
thickness
its
advancing
and
resistless
weight
rolled
over
me
like
a
huge
waveless
ocean
and
absorbed
within
it
i
was
drawn
down
down
down
toward
some
hidden
impalpable
but
all
supreme
agony
the
dull
unceasing
throbs
of
which
i
felt
yet
could
not
name
god
i
cried
aloud
abandoning
myself
to
wild
despair
god
where
are
thou
then
i
heard
a
great
rushing
sound
as
of
a
strong
wind
beaten
through
with
wings
and
a
voice
grand
and
sweet
as
a
golden
trumpet
blown
suddenly
in
the
silence
of
night
answered
and
everywhere
with
that
a
slanting
stream
of
opaline
radiance
cleft
the
gloom
with
the
sweep
of
a
and
i
was
caught
up
quickly
i
know
not
how
for
i
saw
nothing
again
he
pushed
and
looked
wistfully
at
heliobas
who
in
turn
regarded
him
with
gentle
steadfastness
it
was
wonderful
terrible
he
continued
slowly
yet
beautiful
that
invisible
strength
that
rescued
surrounded
and
uplifted
me
and
here
he
hesitated
and
a
faint
flush
colored
his
cheeks
and
stole
up
to
the
roots
of
his
clustering
hair
dream
or
no
dream
i
feel
i
can
not
now
altogether
reject
the
idea
of
an
existing
divinity
in
brief
i
believe
in
god
why
asked
heliobas
quietly
alwyn
met
his
gaze
frankly
and
with
a
soft
brightening
of
his
handsome
features
i
can
not
give
you
any
logical
reasons
he
said
moreover
logical
reasoning
would
not
now
affect
me
in
a
matter
which
seems
to
me
more
full
of
conviction
than
any
logic
i
believe
simply
because
i
believe
heliobas
smiled
a
very
warm
and
kindly
smile
but
said
nothing
and
alwyn
resumed
his
narrative
as
i
tell
you
i
was
caught
up
snatched
out
of
that
black
profundity
with
inconceivable
swiftness
and
when
the
ascending
movement
ceased
i
found
myself
floating
lightly
like
a
leaf
through
twining
arches
of
amber
mist
colored
here
and
there
with
rays
of
living
flame
i
heard
whispers
and
fragments
of
song
and
speech
all
sweeter
than
the
sweetest
of
our
known
music
and
still
i
saw
nothing
presently
some
one
called
me
by
name
theos
i
strove
to
answer
but
i
had
no
words
wherewith
to
match
that
utterance
and
once
again
the
rich
vibrating
notes
pealed
through
the
vaporous
air
my
beloved
higher
higher
all
my
being
thrilled
and
quivered
to
that
call
i
yearned
to
obey
i
struggled
to
rise
my
efforts
were
in
vain
when
to
my
joy
and
wonder
a
small
invisible
hand
delicate
yet
strong
clasped
mine
and
i
was
borne
aloft
with
breathless
indescribable
rapidity
on
on
and
ever
upward
till
at
last
alighting
on
a
smooth
fair
turf
with
fragrant
blossoms
of
strange
loveliness
and
soft
hues
i
beheld
her
and
she
bade
me
welcome
and
who
questioned
heliobas
in
tones
of
hushed
reverence
who
was
this
being
that
thus
enchants
your
memory
i
know
not
replied
alwyn
with
a
dreamy
smile
of
rapture
on
his
lips
and
in
his
eyes
and
yet
her
face
oh
the
entrancing
beauty
of
that
face
was
not
altogether
unfamiliar
i
felt
that
i
must
have
loved
and
lost
her
ages
upon
ages
ago
crowned
with
white
flowers
and
robed
in
a
garb
that
seemed
spun
from
midsummer
moonbeams
she
stood
a
smiling
in
a
paradise
of
glad
sights
and
sounds
ah
eve
with
the
first
sunrise
radiance
on
her
brows
was
not
more
divinely
fair
venus
from
the
silver
was
not
more
queenly
glorious
will
remind
thee
of
all
thou
hast
forgotten
she
said
and
i
understood
her
soft
accents
is
not
yet
too
late
thou
hast
lost
much
and
suffered
much
and
thou
hast
blindly
erred
but
notwithstanding
all
these
things
thou
art
my
beloved
since
these
many
thousand
days
days
which
the
world
counts
as
years
murmured
heliobas
you
saw
no
one
but
her
no
one
we
were
alone
together
a
vast
woodland
stretched
before
us
she
took
my
hand
and
led
me
beneath
trees
to
where
a
lake
silvered
by
some
strange
radiance
glittered
in
the
stirring
of
a
balmy
wind
here
she
bade
me
rest
and
sank
gently
on
the
flowery
bank
beside
me
then
viewing
her
more
closely
i
greatly
feared
her
beauty
for
i
saw
a
wondrous
halo
wide
and
dazzling
a
golden
aureole
that
spread
itself
around
her
in
scintillating
points
of
light
light
that
reflected
itself
also
on
me
and
bathed
me
in
its
luminous
splendor
and
as
i
gazed
at
her
in
speechless
awe
she
leaned
toward
me
nearer
and
nearer
her
deep
pure
eyes
burning
softly
into
mine
her
hands
touched
me
her
arms
closed
round
me
her
bright
head
lay
in
all
its
shining
loveliness
on
my
breast
a
tremulous
ecstasy
thrilled
me
as
with
fire
i
gazed
upon
her
as
one
might
gaze
on
some
fluttering
bird
i
dare
not
move
or
speak
i
drank
her
sweetness
down
into
my
soul
now
and
then
a
sound
as
of
distant
harps
playing
broke
the
silence
and
thus
we
remained
together
a
heavenly
of
wordless
rapture
till
suddenly
and
swiftly
as
though
she
had
received
an
invisible
summons
she
arose
her
looks
expressing
a
saintly
patience
and
laying
her
two
hands
upon
my
brows
she
said
and
proclaim
a
message
of
hope
to
the
sorrowful
star
write
and
let
thine
utterance
be
a
true
echo
of
the
eternal
music
with
which
these
spheres
are
filled
write
to
the
rhythmic
beat
of
the
harmonies
within
thee
for
lo
once
more
as
in
aforetime
my
changeless
love
renews
in
thee
the
power
of
perfect
song
with
that
she
moved
away
serenely
and
beckoned
me
to
follow
i
obeyed
in
haste
and
trembling
long
rays
of
rosy
light
swept
after
her
like
trailing
wings
and
as
she
walked
the
golden
nimbus
round
her
form
glowed
with
a
thousand
brilliant
and
changeful
hues
like
the
rainbows
seen
in
the
spray
of
falling
water
through
lush
green
grass
thick
with
blossom
under
groves
heavy
with
fragrant
leaves
and
laden
with
the
songs
of
birds
over
meadows
cool
and
on
we
went
she
like
the
goddess
of
advancing
spring
i
eagerly
treading
in
her
radiant
footsteps
and
presently
we
came
to
a
place
where
two
paths
met
one
all
overgrown
with
azure
and
white
flowers
that
ascended
away
and
away
into
undiscerned
distance
the
other
sloping
deeply
downward
and
full
of
shadows
yet
dimly
illumined
by
a
pale
mysterious
splendor
like
frosty
moonlight
streaming
on
seas
here
she
turned
and
faced
me
and
i
saw
her
divine
eyes
droop
with
the
moisture
of
unshed
tears
theos
she
cried
and
the
passionate
cadence
of
her
voice
was
as
the
singing
of
a
nightingale
in
lonely
woodlands
again
we
must
part
part
oh
my
beloved
my
beloved
how
long
wilt
thou
sever
me
from
thy
soul
and
leave
me
alone
and
sorrowful
amid
the
joys
of
heaven
as
she
thus
spoke
a
sense
of
utter
shame
and
loss
and
failure
overwhelmed
me
pierced
to
the
very
core
of
my
being
by
an
unexplained
yet
most
bitter
remorse
i
cast
myself
down
in
deep
abasement
before
her
i
caught
her
glittering
robe
i
strove
to
say
but
i
was
speechless
as
a
convicted
traitor
in
the
presence
of
a
wronged
queen
all
at
once
the
air
about
us
was
rent
by
a
great
noise
of
thunder
intermingled
with
triumphal
music
she
drew
her
sheeny
garment
from
my
touch
in
haste
and
stooping
to
me
where
i
knelt
she
kissed
my
forehead
road
lies
there
she
murmured
in
quick
soft
tones
pointing
to
the
vista
of
varying
light
and
shadow
yonder
and
she
looked
toward
the
avenue
it
is
time
thou
wert
far
hence
return
to
thine
own
star
lest
its
portals
be
closed
on
thee
forever
and
thou
be
plunged
into
deeper
darkness
seek
thou
the
field
of
ardath
as
christ
lives
i
will
meet
thee
there
farewell
with
these
words
she
left
me
passing
away
arrayed
in
glory
treading
on
flowers
and
ever
ascending
till
she
disappeared
while
i
stricken
with
a
great
repentance
went
slowly
as
she
bade
me
down
into
the
shadow
and
a
rippling
melody
as
of
harps
and
lutes
most
tenderly
attuned
followed
me
as
i
descended
and
now
said
alwyn
interrupting
his
narrative
and
speaking
with
emphatic
decision
surely
there
remains
but
one
thing
for
me
to
do
that
is
to
find
the
of
ardath
heliobas
smiled
gravely
nay
if
you
consider
the
whole
episode
a
dream
he
observed
why
trouble
yourself
dreams
are
seldom
realized
and
as
to
the
name
of
ardath
have
you
ever
heard
it
before
never
replied
alwyn
still
if
there
is
such
a
place
on
this
planet
i
will
most
certainly
journey
thither
maybe
you
know
something
of
its
whereabouts
finish
your
story
said
heliobas
quietly
evading
the
question
i
am
curious
to
hear
the
end
of
your
strange
adventure
there
is
not
much
more
to
tell
and
alwyn
sighed
a
little
as
he
spoke
i
wandered
further
and
further
into
the
gloom
oppressed
by
many
thoughts
and
troubled
by
vague
fears
till
presently
it
grew
so
dark
that
i
could
scarcely
see
where
i
was
going
though
i
was
able
to
guide
myself
in
the
path
that
stretched
before
me
by
means
of
the
pale
luminous
rays
that
frequently
pierced
the
deepening
obscurity
and
these
rays
i
now
noticed
fell
ever
downwards
in
the
form
of
a
cross
as
i
went
on
i
was
pursued
as
it
were
by
the
sound
of
those
delicate
harmonies
played
on
invisible
sweet
strings
and
after
a
while
i
perceived
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
long
dim
vista
a
door
standing
open
through
which
i
entered
and
found
myself
alone
in
a
quiet
room
here
i
sat
down
to
rest
the
melody
of
the
distant
harps
and
lutes
still
floated
in
soft
echoes
on
the
silence
and
presently
words
came
breaking
through
the
music
like
buds
breaking
from
their
surrounding
words
that
i
was
compelled
to
write
down
as
quickly
as
i
heard
them
and
i
wrote
on
and
on
obeying
that
symphonious
and
rhythmical
dictation
with
a
sense
of
growing
ease
and
pleasure
when
all
suddenly
a
dense
darkness
overcame
me
followed
by
a
gradual
dawning
gray
and
golden
light
the
words
dispersed
into
fragmentary
the
music
died
away
i
started
up
amazed
to
find
myself
here
here
in
this
monastery
of
lars
listening
to
the
chanting
of
the
angelus
he
ceased
and
looked
wistfully
out
through
the
window
at
the
white
encircling
rim
of
the
opposite
now
bathed
in
the
full
splendor
of
noon
heliobas
advanced
and
laid
one
hand
kindly
on
his
shoulder
and
do
not
forget
he
said
that
you
have
brought
with
you
from
the
higher
regions
a
poem
that
will
in
all
probability
make
your
fame
fame
next
grandest
word
to
god
so
wrote
one
of
your
craft
and
no
doubt
you
echo
the
sentiment
have
you
not
desired
to
blazon
your
name
on
the
open
scroll
of
the
world
well
now
you
can
have
your
wish
the
world
waits
to
receive
your
signature
that
is
all
very
well
and
alwyn
smiled
rather
dubiously
as
he
glanced
at
the
manuscript
on
the
table
beside
him
but
the
question
is
considering
how
it
was
written
can
i
dare
i
call
this
poem
mine
most
assuredly
you
can
returned
heliobas
though
your
hesitation
is
a
worthy
one
and
as
rare
as
it
is
worthy
well
would
it
be
for
all
poets
and
artists
were
they
to
pause
thus
and
consider
before
rashly
calling
their
work
their
own
is
the
of
genius
the
poem
is
as
much
yours
as
your
life
is
yours
no
more
and
no
less
in
brief
you
have
recovered
your
lost
inspiration
the
lately
dumb
oracle
speaks
again
and
are
you
not
satisfied
no
said
alwyn
quickly
with
a
sudden
brightening
of
his
eyes
as
he
met
the
keenly
searching
glance
that
accompanied
this
question
no
for
i
love
and
the
desire
of
love
burns
in
me
as
ardently
as
the
desire
of
fame
he
paused
and
in
quieter
tones
continued
you
see
i
speak
freely
and
frankly
to
you
as
though
and
he
laughed
a
little
as
though
i
were
a
good
catholic
and
you
my
good
heavens
if
some
of
the
men
i
know
in
london
were
to
hear
me
they
would
think
me
utterly
crazed
but
craze
or
no
craze
i
feel
i
shall
never
be
satisfied
now
till
i
find
out
whether
there
is
anywhere
is
the
world
a
place
called
ardath
can
you
will
you
help
me
in
the
search
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
ask
you
for
you
have
already
done
so
much
for
me
and
i
really
owe
to
your
wonderful
power
my
trance
or
or
whatever
it
may
be
called
you
owe
me
nothing
interposed
heliobas
calmly
not
even
thanks
your
own
will
accomplished
your
freedom
and
i
am
not
responsible
for
either
your
departure
or
your
return
it
was
a
predestined
occurrence
yet
perfectly
scientific
and
easy
of
explanation
your
inward
force
attracted
mine
down
upon
you
in
one
strong
current
with
the
result
that
your
spirit
instantly
parted
asunder
from
your
body
and
in
that
released
condition
you
experienced
what
you
have
described
but
had
no
more
to
do
with
that
experience
than
i
shall
have
with
your
journey
to
the
of
ardath
should
you
decide
to
go
there
there
is
an
ardath
then
cried
alwyn
excitedly
heliobas
eyed
him
with
something
of
scorn
naturally
are
you
still
so
much
of
a
sceptic
that
you
think
an
angel
would
have
bidden
you
seek
a
place
that
had
no
existence
oh
yes
i
see
you
are
inclined
to
treat
your
ethereal
adventure
as
a
mere
dream
but
know
it
was
a
reality
more
real
than
anything
in
this
present
world
and
turning
to
the
loaded
bookshelves
he
took
down
a
large
volume
and
spread
it
open
on
the
table
you
know
this
book
he
asked
alwyn
glanced
at
it
the
bible
of
course
he
replied
indifferently
everybody
knows
it
pardon
and
heliobas
smiled
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
nobody
knows
it
to
read
is
not
always
to
understand
there
are
meanings
and
mysteries
in
it
which
have
never
yet
been
penetrated
and
which
only
the
highest
and
most
spiritually
gifted
intellects
can
ever
hope
to
unravel
now
and
he
turned
over
the
pages
carefully
till
he
came
to
the
one
he
sought
i
think
there
is
something
here
that
will
interest
you
listen
and
he
read
aloud
angel
uriel
came
unto
me
and
said
go
into
a
field
of
flowers
where
no
house
is
builded
and
eat
only
the
flowers
of
the
field
taste
no
flesh
drink
no
wine
but
eat
flowers
only
and
pray
unto
the
highest
continually
and
then
will
i
come
and
talk
to
thee
so
i
went
my
way
into
the
field
which
is
called
ardath
the
very
place
exclaimed
alwyn
eagerly
bending
over
the
sacred
book
then
drawing
back
with
a
gesture
of
disappointment
he
added
but
you
are
reading
from
esdras
the
apocrypha
an
utterly
unreliable
source
of
information
on
the
contrary
as
reliable
as
any
history
ever
written
rejoined
heliobas
calmly
study
it
for
yourself
you
will
see
that
the
prophet
was
at
that
time
resident
in
babylon
the
field
he
mentions
was
near
the
city
yes
was
interrupted
alwyn
incredulously
was
and
is
continued
heliobas
no
earthquake
has
crumbled
it
no
sea
has
invaded
it
and
no
house
has
been
thereon
it
is
as
it
was
then
a
waste
field
lying
about
four
miles
west
of
the
babylonian
ruins
and
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
hinder
you
from
journeying
thither
when
you
please
alwyn
expression
as
he
heard
this
was
one
of
stupefied
amazement
part
of
his
dream
had
already
proved
itself
true
a
field
of
ardath
actually
existed
you
are
certain
of
what
you
say
he
demanded
positively
certain
returned
heliobas
there
was
a
silence
during
which
a
little
tinkling
bell
resounded
in
the
outer
corridor
followed
by
the
tread
of
sandaled
feet
on
the
stone
pavement
heliobas
closed
the
bible
and
returned
it
to
its
shelf
that
was
the
he
announced
cheerfully
will
you
accompany
me
to
the
refectory
alwyn
we
can
talk
further
of
this
matter
afterwards
alwyn
roused
himself
from
the
fit
of
abstraction
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
gathering
together
the
loose
sheets
of
his
so
strangely
written
manuscript
he
arranged
them
all
in
an
orderly
heap
without
speaking
then
he
looked
up
and
met
the
earnest
eyes
of
heliobas
with
an
expression
of
settled
resolve
in
his
own
i
shall
set
out
for
babylon
he
said
quietly
as
well
go
there
as
anywhere
and
on
the
result
of
my
journey
i
shall
stake
my
future
in
the
mean
time
he
hesitated
then
suddenly
extending
his
hand
with
a
frank
grace
that
became
him
well
in
spite
of
my
brusquerie
last
night
i
trust
we
are
friends
why
most
assuredly
we
are
returned
heliobas
heartily
pressing
the
proffered
palm
you
had
your
doubts
of
me
and
you
have
them
still
but
what
of
that
i
take
no
offence
at
unbelief
i
pity
those
who
suffer
from
its
destroying
influence
too
profoundly
to
find
room
in
my
heart
for
anger
moreover
i
never
try
to
convert
anybody
it
is
so
much
more
satisfactory
when
sceptics
convert
themselves
as
you
are
unconsciously
doing
come
shall
we
join
the
brethren
over
alwyn
face
flitted
a
transient
shade
of
uneasiness
and
hauteur
i
would
rather
they
knew
nothing
about
all
this
he
began
make
your
mind
quite
easy
on
that
score
rejoined
heliobas
none
of
my
companions
here
are
aware
of
your
recent
departure
except
my
very
old
personal
friend
hilarion
who
with
myself
saw
your
body
while
in
its
state
of
temporary
death
but
he
is
one
of
those
remarkably
rare
wise
men
who
know
when
it
is
best
to
be
silent
then
again
he
is
ignorant
as
to
the
results
of
your
and
will
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
remain
in
ignorance
your
confidence
i
assure
you
is
perfectly
safe
with
me
as
safe
as
though
it
had
been
received
under
the
sacred
seal
of
confession
with
this
understanding
alwyn
seemed
relieved
and
satisfied
and
thereupon
they
left
the
apartment
together
chapter
vi
nourhalma
and
the
original
esdras
later
on
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
when
the
sun
poised
above
the
western
appeared
to
be
lazily
looking
about
him
with
a
drowsy
golden
smile
of
farewell
before
descending
to
his
rest
alwyn
was
once
more
alone
in
the
library
twilight
shadows
were
already
gathering
in
the
corners
of
the
long
low
room
but
he
had
moved
the
to
the
window
in
order
to
enjoy
the
magnificence
of
the
surrounding
scenery
and
sat
where
the
light
fell
full
upon
his
face
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
in
an
attitude
of
pleased
indolence
he
had
just
finished
reading
from
beginning
to
end
the
poem
he
had
composed
in
his
trance
there
was
not
a
line
in
it
he
could
have
wished
altered
not
a
word
that
would
have
been
better
omitted
the
only
thing
it
lacked
was
a
title
and
this
was
the
question
on
which
he
now
pondered
the
subject
of
the
poem
itself
was
not
new
to
him
it
was
a
story
he
had
known
from
boyhood
an
old
eastern
fantastically
beautiful
as
many
such
legends
are
full
of
grace
and
passionate
fervor
a
theme
fitted
for
the
of
a
singer
like
the
persian
hafiz
though
even
hafiz
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
match
the
exquisitely
choice
language
and
delicately
ringing
rhythm
in
which
this
quaint
idyll
of
long
past
ages
was
now
most
perfectly
set
like
a
jewel
in
fine
gold
alwyn
himself
entirely
realized
the
splendid
literary
value
of
the
composition
he
knew
that
nothing
more
artistic
in
conception
or
more
finished
in
treatment
had
appeared
since
the
agnes
eve
of
keats
and
as
he
thought
of
this
he
yielded
to
a
growing
sense
of
satisfaction
which
gradually
destroyed
all
the
deeply
devout
humility
he
had
at
first
felt
concerning
the
high
and
mysterious
origin
of
his
inspiration
the
old
inherent
pride
of
his
nature
reasserted
itself
he
reviewed
all
the
circumstances
of
his
trance
in
the
most
practical
manner
and
calling
to
mind
how
the
poet
coleridge
had
improvised
the
delicious
fragment
of
kubla
khan
in
a
dream
he
began
to
see
nothing
so
very
remarkable
in
his
own
unconscious
production
of
a
complete
poem
while
under
mesmeric
or
magnetic
influences
after
all
he
mused
the
matter
is
simple
enough
when
one
reasons
it
out
i
have
been
unable
to
write
anything
worth
writing
for
a
long
time
and
i
told
heliobas
as
much
he
knowing
my
apathetic
condition
of
brain
employed
his
force
accordingly
though
he
denies
having
done
so
and
this
poem
is
evidently
the
result
of
my
long
thoughts
that
struggled
for
utterance
yet
could
not
before
find
vent
in
words
the
only
mysterious
part
of
the
affair
is
this
of
ardath
how
its
name
haunts
me
and
how
her
face
shines
before
the
eyes
of
my
memory
that
she
should
be
a
phantom
of
my
own
creation
seems
impossible
for
when
have
i
even
in
my
wildest
freaks
of
fancy
ever
imagined
a
creature
half
so
fair
his
gaze
rested
dreamily
on
the
opposite
peaks
above
which
large
fleecy
clouds
themselves
like
moving
mountains
were
slowly
passing
their
edges
glowing
with
purple
and
gold
as
they
neared
the
sinking
sun
presently
rousing
himself
he
took
up
a
pen
and
first
of
all
addressing
an
envelope
to
the
honble
francis
villiers
constitutional
club
london
he
rapidly
wrote
off
the
following
letter
monastery
of
lars
pass
of
dariel
caucasus
my
dear
villiers
start
not
at
the
above
address
i
am
not
yet
vowed
to
perpetual
seclusion
silence
or
celibacy
that
i
of
all
men
in
the
world
should
be
in
a
monastery
will
seem
to
you
who
know
my
prejudices
in
the
last
degree
absurd
nevertheless
here
i
am
though
here
i
do
not
remain
as
it
is
my
fixed
intention
at
daybreak
to
depart
straightway
from
hence
en
route
for
the
supposed
site
and
ruins
of
babylon
yes
babylon
why
not
perished
greatness
has
always
been
a
more
interesting
subject
of
contemplation
to
me
than
existing
littleness
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
wander
among
the
tumuli
of
the
ancient
fallen
city
with
more
satisfaction
than
in
the
hot
streets
of
london
paris
or
vienna
all
destined
to
become
tumuli
in
their
turn
moreover
i
am
on
the
track
of
an
adventure
on
the
search
for
a
new
sensation
having
tried
nearly
all
the
old
ones
and
found
them
nil
you
know
my
nomadic
and
restless
disposition
perhaps
there
is
something
of
the
greek
gipsy
about
me
a
craving
for
constant
change
of
scene
and
surroundings
however
as
my
absence
from
you
and
england
is
likely
to
be
somewhat
prolonged
i
send
you
in
the
mean
time
a
poem
there
your
admiration
for
a
while
and
hear
me
out
patiently
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
all
you
would
say
concerning
the
utter
folly
and
uselessness
of
writing
poetry
at
all
in
this
present
age
of
shilling
sensationals
and
lascivious
society
dramas
and
i
have
a
very
keen
recollection
too
of
the
way
in
which
my
last
book
was
maltreated
by
the
entire
press
good
heavens
how
the
critics
yelped
like
dogs
about
my
heels
snapping
sniffing
and
snarling
i
could
have
wept
then
like
the
sensitive
fool
i
was
i
can
laugh
now
in
brief
my
friend
for
you
are
my
friend
and
the
best
of
all
possible
good
fellows
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
conquer
those
that
have
risen
against
me
to
break
through
the
ranks
of
pedantic
and
opinions
and
to
climb
the
heights
of
fame
regardless
of
the
little
popular
pipers
of
tame
verso
that
obstruct
my
path
and
blow
their
tin
whistles
in
the
public
ears
to
drown
if
possible
my
song
i
will
be
heard
and
to
this
end
i
pin
my
faith
on
the
work
i
now
transmit
to
your
care
have
it
published
immediately
and
in
the
best
style
i
will
cover
all
expenses
advertise
sufficiently
yet
with
becoming
modesty
for
is
a
thing
i
heartily
despise
and
were
the
whole
press
to
turn
round
and
applaud
me
as
much
as
it
has
hitherto
abused
and
ridiculed
me
i
would
not
have
one
of
its
penny
lines
of
condescendingly
ignorant
approval
quoted
in
connection
with
what
must
be
a
perfectly
unostentatious
and
simple
announcement
of
this
new
production
from
my
pen
the
manuscript
is
exceptionally
clear
even
for
me
who
do
not
as
a
male
write
a
very
bad
scrawl
so
that
you
can
scarcely
have
much
bother
with
the
though
even
were
this
the
case
and
the
printers
turned
out
to
be
incorrigible
blockheads
and
blunderers
i
know
you
would
grudge
neither
time
nor
trouble
expended
in
my
service
good
frank
villiers
how
much
i
owe
you
and
yet
i
willingly
incur
another
debt
of
gratitude
by
placing
this
matter
in
your
hands
and
am
content
to
borrow
more
of
your
friendship
but
only
believe
me
in
order
to
repay
it
again
with
the
truest
interest
by
the
way
do
you
remember
when
we
visited
the
last
paris
salon
together
how
fascinated
we
were
by
one
picture
the
head
of
a
monk
whose
eyes
looked
out
like
a
veritable
illumination
from
under
the
folds
of
a
drooping
white
cowl
and
on
referring
to
our
catalogues
we
found
it
described
as
the
portrait
of
one
an
eastern
mystic
a
psychist
formerly
well
known
in
paris
but
since
retired
into
monastic
life
well
i
have
discovered
him
here
he
is
apparently
the
superior
or
chief
of
this
order
though
what
order
it
is
and
when
founded
is
more
than
i
can
tell
there
are
fifteen
monks
altogether
living
contentedly
in
this
old
habitation
among
the
barren
steeps
of
the
frozen
caucasus
splendid
princely
looking
fellows
all
of
them
heliobas
himself
being
an
exceptionally
fine
specimen
of
his
race
i
have
just
dined
with
the
whole
community
and
have
been
fairly
astonished
by
the
fluent
brilliancy
and
wit
of
their
conversation
they
speak
all
languages
english
included
and
no
subject
comes
amiss
to
them
for
they
are
familiar
with
the
latest
political
situations
in
all
countries
they
know
all
about
the
newest
scientific
discoveries
which
they
smile
at
blandly
as
though
these
last
were
mere
child
play
and
they
discuss
our
modern
social
problems
and
theories
with
a
incisiveness
and
composure
such
as
our
parliamentary
howlers
would
do
well
to
imitate
their
doctrine
but
i
will
not
bore
you
by
a
theological
disquisition
enough
to
say
it
is
founded
on
christianity
and
that
at
present
i
do
quite
know
what
to
make
of
it
and
now
my
dear
villiers
farewell
an
answer
to
this
is
unnecessary
besides
i
can
give
you
no
address
as
it
is
uncertain
where
i
shall
be
for
the
next
two
or
three
months
if
i
do
get
as
much
pleasure
as
i
anticipate
from
the
contemplation
of
the
babylonian
ruins
i
shall
probably
take
up
my
abode
in
bagdad
for
a
time
and
try
to
fancy
myself
back
in
the
days
of
haroun
alrascheed
at
any
rate
whatever
becomes
of
me
i
know
i
have
entrusted
my
poem
to
safe
hands
and
all
i
ask
of
you
is
that
it
may
be
brought
out
with
the
least
possible
delay
for
its
immediate
publication
seems
to
me
just
now
the
most
vitally
important
thing
in
the
world
except
except
the
adventure
on
which
i
am
at
present
engaged
of
which
more
hereafter
when
we
meet
until
then
think
as
well
of
me
as
you
can
and
believe
me
ever
and
most
truly
your
friend
theos
alwyn
this
letter
finished
folded
and
sealed
alwyn
once
more
took
up
his
manuscript
and
meditated
anew
concerning
its
title
stay
why
not
call
it
by
the
name
of
the
ideal
heroine
whose
and
sorrow
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
legend
a
name
that
he
in
very
truth
was
all
unconscious
of
having
chosen
but
which
occurred
frequently
with
musical
persistence
throughout
the
entire
poem
nourhalma
it
had
a
soft
sound
it
seemed
to
breathe
of
eastern
languor
and
it
was
surely
the
best
title
he
could
have
straightway
deciding
thereon
he
wrote
it
clearly
at
the
top
of
the
first
page
thus
nourhalma
a
love
legend
of
the
past
then
turning
to
the
end
he
signed
his
own
name
with
a
bold
flourish
thus
attesting
his
indisputable
right
to
the
authorship
of
what
was
not
only
destined
to
be
the
most
famous
poetical
masterpiece
of
the
day
but
was
also
to
prove
the
most
astonishing
complex
and
humiliating
problem
ever
suggested
to
his
brain
carefully
numbering
the
pages
he
folded
them
in
a
neat
packet
which
he
tied
strongly
and
sealed
then
addressing
it
to
his
friend
he
put
letter
and
packet
together
and
eyed
them
both
somewhat
wistfully
feeling
that
with
them
went
his
great
chance
of
immortal
fame
immortal
fame
what
a
grand
vista
of
fair
possibilities
those
words
unveiled
to
his
imagination
lost
in
pleasant
musings
he
looked
out
again
on
the
landscape
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
mountains
so
far
that
nothing
was
left
of
his
glowing
presence
but
a
golden
rim
from
which
great
glittering
rays
spread
upward
like
lifted
lances
poised
against
the
purple
and
roseate
clouds
a
slight
click
caused
by
the
opening
of
the
door
disturbed
his
reverie
he
turned
round
in
his
chair
and
half
rose
from
it
as
heliobas
entered
carrying
a
small
richly
chased
silver
casket
ah
good
heliobas
here
you
are
at
last
he
said
with
a
smile
i
began
to
think
you
were
never
coming
my
correspondence
is
finished
and
as
you
see
my
poem
is
addressed
to
england
where
i
pray
it
may
meet
with
a
better
fate
than
has
hitherto
attended
my
efforts
you
pray
queried
heliobas
meaningly
or
you
hope
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
i
suppose
there
is
he
returned
nonchalantly
and
certainly
to
be
correct
i
should
have
said
i
hope
for
i
never
pray
what
have
you
there
this
as
heliobas
set
the
casket
he
carried
down
on
the
table
before
him
a
reliquary
and
is
it
supposed
to
contain
a
fragment
of
the
true
cross
alas
i
can
not
believe
in
these
fragments
there
are
too
many
of
them
heliobas
laughed
gently
you
are
right
moreover
not
a
single
splinter
of
the
true
cross
is
in
existence
it
was
like
other
crosses
then
in
general
use
thrown
aside
as
lumber
and
had
rotted
away
into
the
earth
long
before
the
empress
helena
started
on
her
piously
crazed
wanderings
no
i
have
nothing
of
that
sort
in
here
and
taking
a
key
from
a
small
chain
that
hung
at
his
girdle
he
unlocked
the
casket
this
has
been
in
the
possession
of
the
various
members
of
our
order
for
ages
it
is
our
chief
treasure
and
is
seldom
i
may
say
never
shown
to
strangers
but
the
mystic
mandate
you
have
received
concerning
the
of
ardath
entitles
you
to
see
what
i
think
must
needs
prove
interesting
to
you
under
the
circumstances
and
opening
the
box
he
lifted
out
a
small
square
volume
bound
in
massive
silver
and
this
he
went
on
is
the
original
text
of
a
portion
of
the
of
esdras
and
dates
from
the
thirteenth
year
after
the
downfall
of
babylon
commercial
prosperity
alwyn
uttered
an
exclamation
of
incredulous
amazement
not
possible
he
cried
then
he
added
eagerly
may
i
look
at
it
silently
heliobas
placed
it
in
his
outstretched
hand
as
he
undid
the
clasps
a
faint
odor
like
that
of
long
dead
came
like
a
breath
on
the
air
he
opened
it
and
saw
that
its
pages
consisted
of
twelve
moderately
thick
sheets
of
ivory
which
were
covered
all
over
with
curious
small
characters
finely
engraved
thereon
by
some
evidently
sharp
and
instrument
these
letters
were
utterly
unknown
to
alwyn
he
had
seen
nothing
like
them
in
any
of
the
ancient
tongues
and
he
examined
them
perplexedly
what
language
is
this
he
asked
at
last
looking
up
it
is
not
hebrew
nor
yet
sanskrit
nor
does
it
resemble
any
of
the
discovered
forms
of
hieroglyphic
writing
can
you
understand
it
perfectly
returned
heliobas
if
i
could
not
then
much
of
the
wisdom
and
science
of
past
ages
would
be
closed
to
my
researches
it
is
the
language
once
commonly
spoken
by
certain
great
nations
which
existed
long
before
the
foundations
of
babylon
were
laid
little
by
little
it
fell
into
disuse
till
it
was
only
kept
up
among
scholars
and
sages
and
in
time
became
known
only
as
language
of
prophecy
when
esdras
wrote
his
visions
they
were
originally
divided
into
two
hundred
and
four
books
and
as
you
will
see
by
referring
to
what
is
now
called
the
apocrypha
footnote
vide
esdras
he
was
commanded
to
publish
them
all
openly
to
the
and
unworthy
all
except
the
last
which
were
to
be
delivered
solely
to
such
as
were
among
the
people
thus
one
hundred
and
were
written
in
the
vulgar
tongue
the
remaining
seventy
in
the
of
prophecy
for
the
use
of
deeply
learned
and
scientific
men
alone
the
volume
you
hold
is
one
of
those
seventy
how
did
you
come
by
it
asked
alwyn
curiously
turning
the
book
over
and
over
how
did
our
order
come
by
it
you
mean
said
heliobas
very
simply
chaldean
fraternities
existed
in
the
time
of
esdras
and
to
the
supreme
chief
of
these
esdras
himself
delivered
it
you
look
dubious
but
i
assure
you
it
is
quite
authentic
we
have
its
entire
history
up
to
date
then
are
you
all
chaldeans
here
not
all
but
most
of
us
three
of
the
brethren
are
egyptians
and
two
are
natives
of
damascus
the
rest
are
like
myself
descendants
of
a
race
supposed
to
have
perished
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
yet
still
powerful
to
a
degree
undreamed
of
by
the
men
of
this
puny
age
alwyn
gave
an
upward
glance
at
the
speaker
regal
form
a
glance
of
genuine
admiration
as
far
as
that
goes
he
said
with
a
frank
laugh
i
quite
willing
to
believe
you
and
your
companions
are
kings
in
disguise
you
all
have
that
appearance
but
regarding
this
book
and
again
he
turned
over
the
relic
if
its
authenticity
can
be
proved
as
you
say
why
the
british
museum
would
give
ah
let
me
see
it
would
give
nothing
declared
heliobas
quietly
believe
me
nothing
the
british
government
would
no
doubt
accept
it
as
a
gift
just
as
it
would
with
equal
alacrity
accept
the
veritable
signature
of
homer
which
we
also
possess
in
another
retreat
of
ours
on
the
isle
of
lemnos
but
our
treasures
are
neither
for
giving
nor
selling
and
with
respect
to
this
original
it
will
certainly
never
pass
out
of
our
hands
and
what
of
the
other
missing
books
asked
alwyn
they
may
possibly
be
somewhere
in
the
world
two
of
them
i
know
were
buried
in
the
coffin
of
one
of
the
last
princes
of
chaldea
perhaps
they
will
be
unearthed
some
day
there
is
also
a
rumor
to
the
effect
that
esdras
engraved
his
prophecy
on
a
small
oval
tablet
of
pure
jasper
which
he
himself
secreted
no
one
knows
where
but
to
come
to
the
point
of
immediate
issue
shall
i
find
out
and
translate
for
you
the
allusions
to
the
of
contained
in
this
present
volume
do
said
alwyn
eagerly
at
once
returning
the
book
to
heliobas
who
seating
himself
at
the
table
began
carefully
looking
over
its
ivory
pages
i
am
all
impatience
even
without
the
vision
i
have
had
i
should
still
feel
a
desire
to
see
this
mysterious
field
for
its
own
sake
it
must
have
some
very
strange
associations
to
be
worth
specifying
in
such
a
particular
manner
heliobas
answered
nothing
he
was
entirely
occupied
in
examining
the
small
closely
engraved
characters
in
which
the
ancient
record
was
written
the
crimson
afterglow
of
the
now
descended
sun
flared
through
the
window
and
sent
a
straight
rosy
ray
on
his
bent
head
and
white
robes
lighting
to
a
more
lustrous
brilliancy
the
golden
cross
and
jeweled
star
on
his
breast
and
flashing
round
the
silver
clasps
of
the
relic
before
him
presently
he
looked
up
here
we
have
it
and
he
placed
his
finger
on
one
especial
passage
it
reads
as
follows
the
angel
bade
me
enter
a
waste
field
and
the
field
was
barren
and
dry
save
of
herbs
and
the
name
of
the
field
was
ardath
i
wandered
therein
through
the
hours
of
the
long
night
and
the
silver
eyes
of
the
field
did
open
before
me
and
i
saw
signs
and
wonders
i
heard
a
voice
crying
aloud
esdras
esdras
i
arose
and
stood
on
my
feet
and
listened
and
refrained
not
till
i
heard
the
voice
again
said
unto
me
behold
the
field
thou
thoughtest
barren
how
great
a
glory
hath
the
moon
unveiled
i
beheld
and
was
sore
amazed
for
i
was
no
longer
myself
but
another
the
sword
of
death
was
in
that
other
soul
and
yet
that
other
was
but
myself
in
pain
i
knew
not
those
things
that
were
once
familiar
and
my
heart
failed
within
me
for
very
fear
the
voice
cried
aloud
again
saying
hide
thee
from
the
perils
of
the
past
and
the
perils
of
the
future
for
a
great
and
terrible
thing
is
come
upon
thee
against
which
thy
strength
is
as
a
reed
in
the
wind
and
thy
thoughts
as
flying
sand
footnote
see
esdras
x
and
lo
i
lay
as
one
that
had
been
dead
and
mine
understanding
was
taken
from
me
and
he
the
angel
took
me
by
the
right
hand
and
comforted
me
and
set
me
upon
my
feet
and
said
unto
me
aileth
thee
and
why
art
thou
so
disquieted
and
why
is
thine
understanding
troubled
and
the
thoughts
of
thine
heart
i
said
because
thou
hast
forsaken
me
and
yet
i
did
according
to
thy
words
and
i
went
into
the
field
and
lo
i
have
seen
and
yet
see
that
i
am
not
able
to
express
here
heliobas
paused
having
read
the
last
sentence
with
peculiarly
impressive
emphasis
that
is
all
he
said
i
see
no
more
allusions
to
the
name
of
ardath
the
last
three
verses
are
the
same
as
those
in
the
accepted
apocrypha
chapter
vii
an
undesired
blessing
alwyn
had
listened
with
an
absorbed
yet
somewhat
mystified
air
of
attention
the
venerable
esdras
was
certainly
a
poet
in
his
own
way
he
remarked
lightly
there
is
something
very
fascinating
about
the
rhythm
of
his
lines
though
i
confess
i
do
grasp
their
meaning
still
i
should
like
to
have
them
all
the
same
will
you
let
me
write
them
out
just
as
you
have
translated
them
willingly
assenting
to
this
heliobas
read
the
extract
over
again
alwyn
taking
down
the
words
from
his
dictation
perhaps
he
then
added
musingly
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
copy
a
few
passages
from
the
apocrypha
also
whereupon
the
bible
was
brought
into
requisition
and
the
desired
quotations
made

the

is
requested
to
refer
to
the
parts
of
esdras
here
indicated
ninth
chapter
of
the
second
book
of
esdras
and
verses
xxv
to
xxvi
in
the
tenth
chapter
of
the
same
this
done
heliobas
closed
and
clasped
the
original
text
of
the
prophet
work
and
returned
it
to
its
casket
then
addressing
his
guest
in
a
kindly
yet
serious
tone
he
said
you
are
quite
resolved
to
undertake
this
journey
mr
alwyn
alwyn
looked
dreamily
out
of
the
window
at
the
flame
of
the
sunset
hues
reflected
from
the
glowing
sky
on
the
white
summit
of
the
mountains
yes
i
i
think
so
the
answer
had
a
touch
of
indecision
in
it
in
that
case
resumed
heliobas
i
have
prepared
a
letter
of
introduction
for
you
to
one
of
our
order
known
as
elzear
of
melyana
he
is
a
recluse
and
his
hermitage
is
situated
close
to
the
babylonian
ruins
you
will
find
rest
and
shelter
there
after
the
fatigues
of
travel
i
have
also
traced
out
a
map
of
the
district
and
the
exact
position
of
the
field
you
seek
here
it
is
and
he
laid
a
square
piece
of
parchment
on
the
table
you
can
easily
perceive
at
a
glance
how
the
land
lies
there
are
a
few
directions
written
at
the
back
so
i
think
you
will
have
no
difficulty
this
is
the
letter
to
elzear
here
he
held
out
a
folded
paper
will
you
take
it
now
alwyn
received
it
with
a
dubious
smile
and
eyed
the
donor
as
if
he
rather
suspected
the
sincerity
of
his
intentions
thanks
very
much
he
murmured
listlessly
you
are
exceedingly
good
to
make
it
all
such
plain
sailing
for
me
and
yet
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
i
ca
help
thinking
i
am
going
on
a
fool
errand
if
that
is
your
opinion
why
go
at
all
queried
heliobas
with
a
slight
disdain
in
his
accents
return
to
england
instead
forget
the
name
of
and
forget
also
the
one
who
bade
you
meet
her
there
and
who
has
waited
for
you
many
thousand
days
alwyn
started
as
if
he
had
been
stung
ah
he
exclaimed
if
i
could
be
certain
of
seeing
her
again
if
good
god
the
idea
seems
absurd
if
that
wonder
of
my
dream
should
actually
fulfill
her
promise
and
keep
her
tryst
well
demanded
heliobas
if
so
what
then
well
then
i
will
believe
in
anything
he
cried
no
miracle
will
seem
no
impossibility
impossible
heliobas
sighed
and
regarded
him
thoughtfully
you
think
you
will
believe
he
said
somewhat
sadly
but
doubts
such
as
yours
are
not
easily
dispelled
angels
have
ere
now
descended
to
men
men
have
neither
received
nor
recognized
them
angels
walk
by
our
side
through
crowded
cities
and
lonely
woodlands
they
watch
us
when
we
sleep
they
hear
us
when
we
pray
and
yet
the
human
eye
sees
nothing
save
the
material
objects
within
reach
of
its
vision
and
is
not
very
sure
of
those
while
it
can
no
more
discern
the
spiritual
presences
than
it
can
without
a
microscope
discern
the
lovely
living
creatures
contained
in
a
drop
of
dew
or
a
ray
of
sunshine
our
earthly
sight
is
very
limited
it
can
neither
perceive
the
infinitely
little
nor
the
infinitely
great
and
it
is
possible
nay
it
is
most
probable
that
even
as
peter
of
old
denied
his
divine
master
so
you
if
brought
face
to
face
with
the
angel
of
your
last
night
experience
would
deny
and
endeavor
to
disprove
her
identity
never
declared
alwyn
with
a
passionate
gesture
i
should
know
her
among
a
thousand
for
one
instant
heliobas
bent
upon
him
a
sudden
searching
almost
pitiful
glance
then
withdrawing
his
gaze
he
said
gently
well
well
let
us
hope
for
the
best
god
ways
are
inscrutable
and
you
tell
me
that
now
now
after
your
strange
you
believe
in
god
i
did
say
so
certainly
and
alwyn
face
flushed
a
but
ah
you
hesitate
there
is
a
in
the
case
and
heliobas
turned
upon
him
with
a
grand
reproach
in
his
brilliant
already
stepping
backward
on
the
road
already
rushing
once
again
into
the
darkness
he
paused
then
laying
one
hand
on
the
young
shoulder
continued
in
mild
yet
impressive
accents
my
friend
remember
that
the
doubter
and
opposer
of
god
is
also
the
doubter
and
opposer
of
his
own
let
this
unnatural
and
useless
combat
of
human
reason
against
divine
instinct
cease
within
you
you
who
as
a
poet
are
bound
to
equalize
your
nature
that
it
may
the
more
harmoniously
fulfil
its
high
commission
you
know
what
one
of
your
modern
writers
says
of
life
that
it
is
a
in
which
we
clutch
at
shadows
as
though
they
were
substances
and
sleep
deepest
when
fancying
ourselves
most
awake
footnote
carlyle
sartor
resartus
believe
me
you
have
slept
long
enough
it
is
time
you
awoke
to
the
full
realization
of
your
destinies
alwyn
heard
in
silence
feeling
inwardly
rebuked
and
half
ashamed
the
earnestly
spoken
words
moved
him
more
than
he
cared
to
show
his
head
drooped
he
made
no
reply
after
all
he
thought
he
had
really
no
more
substantial
foundation
for
his
unbelief
than
others
had
for
their
faith
with
all
his
studies
in
the
modern
schools
of
science
he
was
not
a
whit
more
advanced
in
learning
than
democritus
of
old
democritus
who
based
his
system
of
morals
on
the
severest
mathematical
lines
taking
as
his
a
vacuum
and
atoms
and
who
after
stretching
his
intellect
on
a
constant
rack
of
searching
inquiry
for
years
came
at
last
to
the
unhappy
conclusion
that
man
is
absolutely
incapable
of
positive
knowledge
and
that
even
if
truth
is
in
his
possession
he
can
never
be
certain
of
it
was
he
theos
alwyn
wiser
than
democritus
or
was
this
stately
chaldean
monk
with
the
clear
pathetic
eyes
and
tender
smile
and
the
symbol
of
christ
on
his
breast
wiser
than
both
wiser
in
the
wisdom
of
eternal
things
than
any
of
the
ancient
greek
philosophers
or
modern
imitators
of
their
theories
was
there
could
there
be
something
not
yet
altogether
understood
or
fathomed
in
the
christian
creed
as
this
idea
occurred
to
him
he
looked
up
and
met
his
companion
calm
gaze
fixed
upon
him
with
a
watchful
gentleness
and
patience
are
you
reading
my
thoughts
heliobas
he
asked
with
a
forced
laugh
i
assure
you
they
are
not
worth
the
trouble
heliobas
smiled
but
made
no
answer
just
then
one
of
the
monks
entered
the
room
with
a
large
lighted
lamp
which
he
set
on
the
table
and
the
conversation
thus
interrupted
was
not
again
resumed
the
evening
shadows
were
now
closing
in
rapidly
and
already
above
the
furthest
visible
the
first
risen
star
sparkled
faintly
in
the
darkening
sky
soon
the
vesper
bell
began
ringing
as
it
had
rung
on
the
previous
night
when
alwyn
newly
arrived
had
sat
alone
in
the
refectory
listlessly
wondering
what
manner
of
men
he
had
come
amongst
and
what
would
be
the
final
result
of
his
adventure
into
the
wilds
of
caucasus
his
feelings
had
certainly
undergone
some
change
since
then
inasmuch
as
he
was
no
longer
disposed
to
ridicule
or
condemn
religious
sentiment
though
he
was
nearly
as
far
from
actually
believing
in
religion
itself
as
ever
the
attitude
of
his
mind
was
still
distinctly
skeptical
the
immutable
pride
of
what
he
considered
his
own
firmly
rooted
convictions
was
only
very
slightly
shaken
and
he
now
even
viewed
the
prospect
of
his
journey
to
the
field
of
ardath
as
a
mere
fantastic
whim
a
caprice
of
his
own
fancy
which
he
chose
to
gratify
just
for
the
sake
of
curiosity
but
notwithstanding
the
stubbornness
of
the
materialistic
principles
with
which
he
had
become
imbued
his
higher
instincts
were
unconsciously
to
himself
beginning
to
be
aroused
his
memory
involuntarily
wandered
back
to
the
sweet
fresh
days
of
his
earliest
manhood
before
the
poison
of
doubt
had
filtered
through
his
soul
his
character
naturally
of
the
lofty
imaginative
and
ardent
cast
its
native
force
over
the
blighting
blow
of
blank
atheism
which
had
for
a
time
paralyzed
its
efforts
and
as
he
unwittingly
yielded
more
and
more
to
the
mild
persuasions
of
these
genial
influences
so
the
former
bitterness
of
his
humor
gradually
softened
there
was
no
trace
in
him
now
of
the
dark
ironic
and
reckless
scorn
that
before
his
recent
visionary
experience
had
distinguished
his
whole
manner
and
bearing
the
smile
came
more
readily
to
his
lips
and
he
seemed
content
for
the
present
to
display
the
sunny
side
of
his
nature
a
nature
impassioned
frank
generous
and
noble
in
spite
of
the
taint
of
overweening
ambitions
egotism
which
somewhat
warped
its
true
quality
and
narrowed
the
range
of
its
sympathies
in
his
then
frame
of
mind
a
curious
vague
sense
of
penitence
was
upon
him
delicate
undefined
almost
devotional
suggestions
stirred
his
thoughts
with
the
refreshment
that
a
cool
wind
brings
to
parched
and
drooping
flowers
so
that
when
heliobas
taking
up
the
silver
esdras
reliquary
and
preparing
to
leave
the
apartment
in
response
to
the
vesper
summons
said
gently
will
you
attend
our
service
mr
alwyn
he
assented
at
once
with
a
pleased
alacrity
which
somewhat
astonished
himself
as
he
remembered
how
on
the
previous
evening
he
had
despised
and
inwardly
resented
all
forms
of
religious
observance
however
he
did
not
stop
to
consider
the
reason
of
his
altered
mood
he
followed
the
monks
into
chapel
with
an
air
of
manly
grace
and
quiet
reverence
that
became
him
much
better
than
the
offensive
and
defensive
demeanor
he
had
erewhile
chosen
to
assume
in
the
same
place
he
listened
to
the
impressive
ceremonial
from
beginning
to
end
without
the
least
fatigue
or
impatience
and
though
when
the
brethren
knelt
he
could
not
humble
himself
so
far
as
to
kneel
also
he
still
made
a
slight
concession
to
appearances
by
sitting
down
and
keeping
his
head
in
a
bent
posture
out
of
respect
for
the
good
intentions
of
these
worthy
men
as
he
told
himself
to
silence
the
inner
conflict
of
his
own
opposing
and
contradictory
sensations
the
service
concluded
he
waited
as
before
to
see
the
monks
pass
out
and
was
smitten
with
a
sudden
surprise
compunction
and
regret
when
heliobas
who
walked
last
as
usual
paused
where
he
stood
and
confronted
him
saying
i
will
bid
you
farewell
here
my
friend
i
have
many
things
to
do
this
evening
and
it
is
best
i
should
see
you
no
more
before
your
departure
why
asked
alwyn
astonished
i
had
hoped
for
another
conversation
with
you
to
what
purpose
inquired
heliobas
mildly
that
i
should
assert
and
you
deny
facts
that
god
himself
will
prove
in
his
own
way
and
at
his
own
appointed
time
nay
we
should
do
no
good
by
further
arguments
but
stammered
alwyn
hastily
flushing
hotly
as
he
spoke
you
give
me
no
chance
to
thank
you
to
express
my
gratitude
gratitude
questioned
heliobas
almost
mournfully
with
a
tinge
of
reproach
in
his
soft
mellow
voice
are
you
grateful
for
being
as
you
think
deluded
by
a
trance
cheated
as
it
were
into
a
sort
of
in
the
life
to
come
by
means
of
mesmerism
your
first
request
to
me
i
know
was
that
you
might
be
deceived
by
my
influence
into
a
state
of
imaginary
happiness
and
now
you
fancy
your
last
night
experience
was
merely
the
result
of
that
foolish
desire
you
are
wrong
and
as
matters
stand
no
thanks
are
needed
if
i
had
indeed
mesmerized
or
hypnotized
you
i
might
perhaps
have
deserved
some
reward
for
the
exertion
of
my
purely
professional
skill
but
as
i
have
told
you
already
i
have
done
absolutely
nothing
your
fate
is
as
it
has
always
been
in
your
own
hands
you
sought
me
of
your
own
accord
you
used
me
as
an
instrument
an
unwilling
instrument
remember
whereby
to
break
open
the
prison
doors
of
your
chafed
and
fretting
spirit
and
the
end
of
it
all
is
that
you
depart
from
hence
tomorrow
of
your
own
and
choice
to
fulfill
the
appointed
tryst
made
with
you
as
you
believe
by
a
phantom
in
a
vision
in
brief
here
he
spoke
more
slowly
and
with
marked
emphasis
you
go
to
the
field
of
ardath
to
solve
a
puzzling
problem
namely
as
to
whether
what
we
call
life
is
not
a
dream
and
whether
a
dream
may
not
perchance
be
proved
reality
in
this
enterprise
of
yours
i
have
no
share
nor
will
i
say
more
than
this
god
speed
you
on
your
errand
he
held
out
his
hand
alwyn
grasped
it
looking
earnestly
meanwhile
at
the
fine
intellectual
face
the
clear
pathetic
eyes
the
firm
yet
sensitive
mouth
on
which
there
just
then
rested
a
serious
yet
kindly
smile
what
a
strange
man
you
are
heliobas
he
said
impulsively
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
you
heliobas
gave
him
a
friendly
glance
wish
rather
that
you
knew
more
about
yourself
he
answered
simply
fathom
your
own
mystery
of
being
you
shall
find
none
deeper
greater
or
more
difficult
of
comprehension
alwyn
still
held
his
hand
reluctant
to
let
it
go
finally
releasing
it
with
a
slight
sigh
he
said
well
at
any
rate
though
we
part
now
it
will
not
be
for
long
we
must
meet
again
why
if
we
must
we
shall
rejoined
heliobas
cheerily
must
can
not
be
prevented
in
the
mean
time
farewell
farewell
and
as
this
word
was
spoken
their
eyes
met
instinctively
and
on
a
sudden
impulse
alwyn
bowed
his
head
in
the
lowest
and
most
reverential
salutation
he
had
perhaps
ever
made
to
any
creature
of
mortal
mold
and
as
he
did
so
heliobas
paused
in
the
act
of
turning
away
do
you
care
for
a
blessing
gentle
skeptic
he
asked
in
a
soft
tone
that
thrilled
tenderly
through
the
silence
of
the
chapel
then
receiving
no
reply
he
laid
one
hand
gently
on
the
young
man
dark
clustering
curls
and
with
the
other
slowly
traced
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
the
smooth
broad
fairness
of
his
take
it
my
son
the
only
blessing
i
can
give
thee
the
blessing
of
the
cross
of
christ
which
in
spite
of
thy
desertion
claims
thee
redeems
thee
and
will
yet
possess
thee
for
its
own
and
before
alwyn
could
recover
from
his
astonishment
sufficiently
to
interrupt
and
repudiate
this
to
him
undesired
form
of
benediction
heliobas
had
gone
and
he
was
left
alone
lifting
his
head
he
stared
out
into
the
further
corridor
down
which
he
just
perceived
a
distant
glimmer
of
vanishing
white
robes
and
for
a
moment
he
was
filled
with
speechless
indignation
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sign
thus
traced
on
his
brow
must
be
actually
visible
like
a
red
brand
burnt
into
his
flesh
and
all
his
old
and
violent
prejudices
against
christianity
rushed
back
upon
him
with
the
resentful
speed
of
once
baffled
foes
returning
anew
to
storm
a
citadel
almost
as
rapidly
however
his
anger
cooled
he
remembered
that
in
his
vision
of
the
previous
night
the
light
that
had
guided
him
through
the
long
shadowy
vista
had
always
preceded
him
in
the
form
of
a
cross
and
in
a
softer
mood
he
glanced
at
the
ruby
star
shining
steadily
above
the
otherwise
darkened
altar
involuntarily
the
words
we
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east
and
have
come
to
worship
him
occurred
to
his
memory
but
he
dismissed
them
as
instantly
as
they
suggested
themselves
and
finding
his
own
thoughts
growing
perplexing
and
troublesome
he
hastily
left
the
chapel
joining
some
of
the
monks
who
were
gathered
in
a
picturesque
group
round
the
fire
in
the
refectory
he
sat
chatting
with
them
for
about
half
an
hour
or
so
hoping
to
elicit
from
them
in
the
course
of
conversation
some
particulars
concerning
the
daily
life
character
and
professing
aims
of
their
superior
but
in
this
attempt
he
failed
they
spoke
of
heliobas
as
believing
men
may
speak
of
saints
with
hushed
reverence
and
admiring
tenderness
but
on
any
point
connected
with
his
faith
or
the
spiritual
nature
of
his
theories
they
held
their
peace
evidently
deeming
the
subject
too
sacred
for
discussion
baffled
in
all
his
inquiries
alwyn
at
last
said
and
retired
to
rest
in
the
small
prepared
for
his
accommodation
where
he
enjoyed
a
sound
refreshing
and
dreamless
slumber
the
next
morning
he
was
up
at
daybreak
and
long
before
the
sun
had
risen
above
the
highest
peak
of
caucasus
he
had
departed
from
the
lars
monastery
leaving
a
handsome
donation
in
the
toward
the
various
charitable
works
in
which
the
brethren
were
engaged
such
as
the
rescue
of
travellers
lost
in
the
snow
or
the
burial
of
the
many
victims
murdered
on
or
near
the
pass
of
dariel
by
the
bands
of
fierce
mountain
robbers
and
assassins
that
at
certain
seasons
infest
that
solitary
region
making
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
fortress
of
passanaur
he
there
joined
a
party
of
adventurous
russian
climbers
who
had
just
successfully
accomplished
the
assent
of
mount
kazbek
and
in
their
company
proceeded
through
the
rugged
aragua
valley
to
tiflis
which
he
reached
that
same
evening
from
this
dark
and
town
shadowed
on
all
sides
by
barren
and
cavernous
hills
he
dispatched
the
manuscript
of
his
mysteriously
composed
poem
together
with
the
letter
concerning
it
to
his
friend
villiers
in
england
and
then
yielding
to
a
burning
sense
of
impatience
within
himself
impatience
that
would
brook
no
delay
he
set
out
resolutely
and
at
once
on
his
long
pilgrimage
to
the
land
of
sand
and
ruin
and
gold
the
land
of
terrific
prophecy
and
stern
fulfilment
the
land
of
mighty
and
mournful
memories
where
the
slow
river
euphrates
clasps
in
its
dusky
yellow
ring
the
ashes
of
great
kingdoms
fallen
to
rise
no
more
chapter
viii
by
the
waters
of
babylon
it
was
no
light
or
easy
journey
he
had
thus
rashly
undertaken
on
the
faith
of
a
dream
for
dream
he
still
believed
it
to
be
many
weary
days
and
nights
were
consumed
in
the
comfortless
tedium
of
travel
and
though
he
constantly
told
himself
what
folly
it
was
to
pursue
an
illusive
chimera
of
his
own
imagination
a
mere
phantasm
which
had
somehow
or
other
taken
possession
of
his
brain
at
a
time
when
that
brain
must
have
been
acted
upon
so
he
continued
to
think
by
strong
mesmeric
or
magnetic
influence
he
went
on
his
way
all
the
same
with
a
sort
of
dogged
obstinacy
which
no
fatigue
could
daunt
or
lessen
he
never
lay
down
to
rest
without
the
faint
hope
of
seeing
once
again
if
only
in
sleep
the
radiant
being
whose
haunting
words
had
sent
him
on
this
quest
of
ardath
but
herein
his
expectations
were
not
realized
no
more
angels
floated
before
him
no
sweet
whisper
of
love
encouragement
or
promise
came
mysteriously
on
his
ears
in
the
midnight
silences
his
slumbers
were
always
profound
and
placid
as
those
of
a
child
and
utterly
dreamless
one
consolation
he
had
however
he
could
write
not
a
day
passed
without
his
finding
some
new
inspiration
some
fresh
quaint
and
lovely
thought
that
flowed
of
itself
into
most
perfect
and
rhythmical
utterance
glorious
lines
of
verse
glowing
with
fervor
and
beauty
seemed
to
fall
from
his
pencil
without
any
effort
on
his
part
and
if
he
had
had
reason
in
former
times
to
doubt
the
strength
of
his
poetical
faculty
it
was
now
very
certain
he
could
do
so
longer
his
mind
was
as
a
fine
harp
newly
strung
attuned
and
quivering
with
the
consciousness
of
the
music
within
it
and
as
he
remembered
the
masterpiece
of
poesy
he
had
written
in
his
seeming
trance
the
manuscript
of
which
would
soon
be
in
the
hands
of
the
london
publishers
his
heart
swelled
with
a
growing
and
irrepressible
sense
of
pride
for
he
knew
and
felt
with
an
undefinable
yet
positive
certainty
that
however
much
the
public
or
the
critics
might
gainsay
him
his
fame
as
a
poet
of
the
very
highest
order
would
ere
long
be
asserted
and
assured
a
deep
tranquillity
was
in
his
soul
a
tranquillity
that
seemed
to
increase
the
further
he
went
onward
the
restless
weariness
that
had
once
possessed
him
was
past
and
a
vaguely
sweet
content
pervade
his
being
like
the
odor
of
early
roses
pervading
warm
air
he
felt
he
hoped
he
loved
and
yet
his
feelings
hopes
and
longings
turned
to
something
altogether
undeclared
and
indefinite
as
softly
dim
and
distant
as
the
first
faint
white
wafted
from
the
moon
in
heaven
when
on
the
point
of
rising
she
makes
her
queenly
purpose
known
to
her
waiting
practically
considered
his
journey
was
tedious
and
for
the
most
part
dull
and
uninteresting
in
these
days
of
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
walking
up
and
down
in
it
travelling
has
lost
much
of
its
old
romantic
charm
the
idea
of
traversing
long
distances
no
more
fills
the
expectant
adventurer
with
a
pleasurable
sense
of
uncertainty
and
mystery
he
knows
exactly
what
to
it
is
all
laid
out
for
him
plainly
on
the
level
lines
of
the
commonplace
and
nothing
is
left
to
his
imagination
the
continent
of
europe
has
been
ransacked
from
end
to
end
by
tourists
who
have
turned
it
into
a
sort
of
exhausted
whereof
the
various
entertainments
are
too
familiarly
known
to
arouse
any
fresh
curiosity
the
east
is
nearly
in
the
same
condition
hordes
of
british
and
american
scamper
over
the
soil
of
persia
and
syria
with
the
unconcerned
indifference
of
beings
to
whom
not
only
a
portion
of
the
territory
but
the
whole
world
itself
belongs
and
soon
there
will
not
be
an
inch
of
ground
left
on
the
narrow
extent
of
our
poor
planet
that
has
not
been
trodden
by
the
hasty
scrambling
irreverent
footsteps
of
some
one
or
other
of
the
race
on
his
way
alwyn
met
many
of
his
countrymen
travellers
who
like
himself
had
visited
the
caucasus
and
armenia
and
were
now
en
route
some
for
damascus
some
for
jerusalem
and
the
holy
land
others
again
for
cairo
and
alexandria
to
depart
from
thence
homeward
by
the
usual
mediterranean
line
but
among
these
acquaintance
he
chanced
upon
none
who
were
going
to
the
ruins
of
babylon
he
was
glad
of
this
for
the
peculiar
nature
of
his
enterprise
rendered
a
companion
altogether
undesirable
and
though
on
one
occasion
he
encountered
a
with
a
who
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
fraternize
with
him
and
discover
whither
he
vas
bound
he
succeeded
in
shaking
off
this
incubus
at
mosul
by
taking
him
to
a
wonderful
old
library
in
that
city
where
there
were
a
number
of
french
translations
of
turkish
and
syriac
romances
here
the
straightway
ascended
to
the
seventh
heaven
of
plagiarism
and
began
to
copy
energetically
whole
scenes
and
descriptive
passages
from
authors
unknown
to
english
critics
for
the
purpose
of
inserting
them
hereafter
into
his
own
original
work
of
fiction
and
in
this
congenial
occupation
he
forgot
all
about
the
dark
handsome
man
with
the
wide
brows
of
a
marc
antony
and
the
lips
of
a
catullus
as
he
had
already
described
alwyn
in
the
while
in
mosul
alwyn
himself
picked
up
a
curiosity
in
the
way
of
literature
a
small
quaint
volume
entitled
the
final
philosophy
of
algazzali
the
arabian
it
was
printed
in
two
languages
the
original
arabic
on
one
page
and
facing
it
the
translation
in
very
old
french
the
author
born
described
himself
as
a
poor
student
striving
to
discern
the
truth
of
things
and
his
work
was
a
serious
incisive
patiently
exhaustive
inquiry
into
the
workings
of
nature
the
capabilities
of
human
intelligence
and
the
deceptive
results
of
human
reason
reading
it
alwyn
was
astonished
to
find
that
nearly
all
the
ethical
propositions
offered
for
the
world
consideration
by
the
most
learned
and
cultured
minds
had
been
already
advanced
and
thoroughly
discussed
by
this
same
algazzali
one
passage
in
particular
arrested
his
attention
as
being
singularly
applicable
to
his
own
immediate
condition
it
ran
as
follows
i
began
to
examine
the
objects
of
sensation
and
speculation
to
see
if
they
could
possibly
admit
of
doubt
then
doubts
crowded
upon
me
in
such
numbers
that
my
incertitude
became
complete
whence
results
the
confidence
i
have
in
sensible
things
the
strongest
of
all
our
senses
is
sight
yet
if
we
look
at
the
stars
they
seem
to
be
as
small
as
but
mathematical
proofs
convince
us
that
they
are
larger
than
the
earth
these
and
other
things
are
judged
by
the
senses
but
rejected
by
reason
as
false
i
abandoned
the
senses
therefore
having
seen
my
confidence
in
their
absolute
truth
shaken
perhaps
said
i
there
is
no
assurance
but
in
the
notions
of
reason
that
is
to
say
first
principles
as
that
ten
is
more
than
three
upon
this
the
senses
replied
what
assurance
have
you
that
your
confidence
in
reason
is
not
of
the
same
nature
as
your
confidence
in
us
when
you
relied
on
us
reason
stepped
in
and
gave
us
the
lie
had
not
reason
been
there
you
would
have
continued
to
rely
on
us
well
nay
there
not
exist
some
other
judge
superior
to
reason
who
if
he
appeared
would
refute
the
judgments
of
reason
in
the
same
way
that
reason
refuted
us
the
of
such
a
judge
is
no
proof
of
his
i
strove
to
answer
this
objection
and
my
difficulties
increased
when
i
came
to
reflect
on
sleep
i
said
to
myself
during
sleep
you
give
to
visions
a
reality
and
consistence
and
on
awakening
you
are
made
aware
that
they
were
nothing
but
visions
what
assurance
have
you
that
all
you
feel
and
know
does
actually
exist
it
is
all
true
as
respects
your
condition
at
the
moment
but
it
is
nevertheless
possible
that
another
condition
should
present
itself
which
should
be
to
your
awakened
state
that
which
your
awakened
state
is
now
to
your
sleep
so
that
as
respects
this
higher
condition
your
waking
is
but
sleep
over
and
over
again
alwyn
read
these
words
and
pondered
on
the
deep
and
difficult
problems
they
suggested
and
he
was
touched
to
an
odd
sense
of
shamed
compunction
when
at
the
close
of
the
book
he
came
upon
algazzali
confession
of
utter
vanquishment
and
humility
thus
simply
recorded
i
examined
my
actions
and
found
the
best
were
those
relating
to
instruction
and
education
and
even
there
i
saw
myself
given
up
to
unimportant
sciences
all
useless
in
another
world
reflecting
on
the
aim
of
my
teaching
i
found
it
was
not
pure
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
that
all
my
efforts
were
directed
toward
the
acquisition
of
glory
to
myself
having
therefore
distributed
my
wealth
i
left
bagdad
and
retired
into
syria
where
i
remained
in
solitary
struggle
with
my
soul
combating
my
passions
and
exercising
myself
in
the
purification
of
my
heart
and
in
preparation
for
the
other
world
this
ancient
philosophical
treatise
together
with
the
mystical
passage
from
the
original
text
of
esdras
and
the
selected
verses
from
the
apocrypha
formed
all
alwyn
stock
of
reading
for
the
rest
of
his
journey
the
rhapsodical
lines
of
the
prophet
he
knew
by
heart
as
one
knows
a
favorite
poem
and
he
often
caught
himself
unconsciously
repeating
the
strange
words
behold
the
field
thou
thoughtest
barren
how
great
a
glory
hath
the
moon
unveiled
and
i
beheld
and
was
sore
amazed
for
i
was
no
longer
myself
but
another
and
the
sword
of
death
was
in
that
other
soul
and
yet
that
other
was
but
myself
in
pain
and
i
knew
not
the
things
that
were
once
familiar
and
my
heart
failed
within
me
for
very
fear
what
did
they
mean
he
wondered
or
had
they
any
meaning
at
all
beyond
the
faint
suggestions
of
thought
that
may
occasionally
and
with
difficulty
be
discerned
through
obscure
and
reckless
ecstasies
of
language
which
full
of
sound
and
fury
signify
nothing
was
there
could
there
be
anything
mysterious
or
sacred
in
this
wiste
field
anciently
known
as
ardath
these
questions
flitted
hazily
from
time
to
time
through
his
brain
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
answer
them
either
by
refutation
or
reason
indeed
sober
reason
he
was
well
aware
played
no
part
in
his
present
undertaking
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
a
sultry
parching
day
when
he
at
last
arrived
at
hillah
this
dull
little
town
built
at
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century
out
of
the
then
plentifully
scattered
fragments
of
babylon
has
nothing
to
offer
to
the
modern
traveller
save
various
annoyances
in
the
shape
of
excessive
heat
dust
or
rather
fine
blown
sand
dirt
flies
bad
food
and
general
discomfort
and
finding
the
aspect
of
the
place
not
only
untempting
but
positively
depressing
alwyn
left
his
surplus
luggage
at
a
small
and
unpretentious
hostelry
kept
by
a
frenchman
who
catered
specially
for
archaeological
tourists
and
explorers
and
after
an
hour
rest
set
out
alone
and
on
foot
for
the
eastern
quarter
of
the
ruins
namely
those
which
are
considered
by
investigators
to
begin
about
two
miles
above
hillah
a
little
beyond
them
and
close
to
the
according
to
the
deductions
he
had
received
dwelt
the
religious
recluse
for
whom
he
brought
the
letter
of
introduction
from
heliobas
a
letter
bearing
on
its
cover
a
superscription
in
latin
which
translated
ran
thus
to
the
venerable
and
much
esteemed
elzear
of
melyana
at
the
hermitage
near
hillah
in
faith
peace
and
greeting
anxious
to
reach
elzear
abode
before
nightfall
he
walked
on
as
briskly
as
the
heat
and
heaviness
of
the
sandy
soil
would
allow
keeping
to
the
indistinctly
traced
path
that
crossed
and
at
intervals
the
various
ridges
of
earth
strewn
with
pulverized
fragments
of
brick
bitumen
and
pottery
which
are
now
the
sole
remains
of
stately
buildings
once
famous
in
babylon
a
low
red
sun
was
sinking
slowly
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
when
pausing
to
look
about
him
he
perceived
in
the
near
distance
the
dark
outline
of
the
great
mound
known
as
and
realized
with
a
sort
of
shock
that
he
was
actually
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
crumbled
and
almost
indistinguishable
ruins
of
the
formerly
superb
assyrian
city
that
had
been
as
a
golden
cup
in
the
hand
and
was
now
no
more
in
very
truth
than
a
broken
and
an
empty
vessel
for
the
words
and
babylon
shall
become
heaps
have
certainly
been
verified
with
startling
exactitude
heaps
indeed
it
has
become
nothing
but
heaps
heaps
of
dull
earth
with
here
and
there
a
few
faded
green
tufts
of
wild
tamarisk
which
while
faintly
relieveing
the
blankness
of
the
ground
at
the
same
time
intensify
its
monotonous
dreaminess
alwyn
beholding
the
mournful
desolation
of
the
scene
felt
a
strong
sense
of
disappointment
he
had
expected
something
different
his
imagination
had
pictured
these
historical
ruins
as
being
of
larger
extent
and
more
imposing
character
his
eyes
rested
rather
wearily
on
the
slow
dull
gleam
of
the
euphrates
as
it
wound
past
the
deserted
spaces
where
the
mighty
city
the
astonishment
of
nations
had
once
stood
and
poet
though
he
was
to
the
very
core
of
his
nature
he
could
see
nothing
poetical
in
these
spectral
mounds
and
stone
heaps
save
in
the
significant
remembrance
they
offered
of
the
old
scriptual
prophecy
babylon
is
fallen
is
fallen
her
princes
her
wise
men
her
captains
her
rulers
and
her
mighty
men
shall
sleep
a
perpetual
sleep
and
not
wake
saith
the
king
who
is
the
lord
of
hosts
and
truly
it
seemed
as
if
the
curse
which
had
blighted
the
city
bygone
splendor
had
doomed
even
its
ruins
to
appear
contemptible
just
then
the
glow
of
the
disappearing
sun
touched
the
upper
edge
of
giving
it
for
one
instant
a
weird
effect
as
though
the
ghost
of
some
babylonian
watchman
were
waving
a
lit
torch
from
its
summit
but
the
lurid
glare
soon
faded
and
a
dead
gray
twilight
settled
solemnly
down
over
the
melancholy
landscape
with
a
sudden
feeling
of
dejection
and
lassitude
upon
him
alwyn
heaving
a
deep
sigh
went
onward
and
soon
perceived
lying
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
river
a
small
roughly
erected
tenement
with
a
wooden
cross
on
its
roof
rightly
concluding
that
this
must
be
elzear
of
hermitage
he
quickly
made
his
way
thither
and
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
opened
to
him
at
once
by
a
picturesque
old
man
who
received
him
with
a
mute
sign
of
welcome
and
who
at
the
same
time
laid
one
hand
lightly
but
expressively
on
his
own
lips
to
signify
that
he
was
dumb
this
was
elzear
himself
he
was
attired
in
the
same
sort
of
flowing
garb
as
that
worn
by
the
monks
of
dariel
and
with
his
tall
spare
figure
long
silvery
beard
and
yet
still
brilliant
dark
eyes
he
might
have
served
as
a
perfect
model
for
one
of
the
inspired
prophets
of
bygone
ancient
days
though
nature
had
deprived
him
of
speech
his
serene
countenance
spoke
eloquently
in
his
favor
its
mild
benevolent
expression
betokening
that
inward
peace
of
the
heart
which
so
often
renders
old
age
more
beautiful
than
youth
he
perused
with
careful
slowness
the
letter
alwyn
presented
to
him
and
then
inclining
his
head
gravely
he
made
a
courteous
and
comprehensive
gesture
to
intimate
that
himself
and
all
that
his
house
contained
were
at
the
service
of
the
newcomer
he
proceeded
to
testify
the
sincerity
of
this
assurance
at
once
by
setting
a
plentiful
supply
of
food
and
wine
before
his
guest
waiting
upon
him
moreover
while
he
ate
and
drank
with
a
respectful
humility
which
somewhat
embarrassed
alwyn
who
wished
to
spare
him
the
trouble
of
such
attendance
and
told
him
so
many
times
with
much
earnestness
but
all
to
no
purpose
elzear
only
smiled
gently
and
continued
to
perform
the
duties
of
hospitality
in
his
own
way
it
was
evidently
no
use
interfering
with
him
later
on
he
showed
his
visitor
a
small
apartment
containing
a
neat
bed
together
with
a
table
a
chair
and
a
large
crucifix
which
latter
object
was
suspended
against
the
wall
and
indicating
by
eloquent
signs
that
here
the
weariest
traveller
might
find
good
repose
he
made
a
low
salutation
and
departed
altogether
for
the
night
what
a
still
place
the
hermitage
was
thought
alwyn
as
soon
as
elzear
retreating
steps
had
died
away
into
silence
there
was
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
anywhere
not
even
the
faint
rustle
of
leaves
stirred
by
the
wind
and
what
a
haunting
grave
wistfully
tender
expression
filled
the
face
of
that
sculptured
image
on
the
cross
which
in
intimate
companionship
with
himself
seemed
to
possess
the
little
room
he
could
not
bear
the
appealing
penetrating
look
in
those
yet
piteous
eyes
turning
abruptly
away
he
opened
the
narrow
window
and
folding
his
arms
on
the
sill
surveyed
the
scene
before
him
the
full
moon
was
rising
slowly
round
and
large
she
hung
like
a
yellow
shield
on
the
dark
dense
wall
of
the
sky
the
rums
of
babylon
were
plainly
the
river
shone
like
a
golden
ribbon
the
outline
of
was
faintly
rimmed
with
light
and
had
little
streaks
of
amber
radiance
wandering
softly
up
and
down
its
shadowy
slopes
i
went
into
the
field
called
ardath
and
there
i
sat
among
the
flowers
mused
alwyn
half
aloud
his
dreamy
gaze
fixed
on
the
gradually
brightening
heavens
why
not
go
there
at
once
now
chapter
ix
the
field
of
flowers
this
idea
had
no
sooner
entered
his
mind
than
he
prepared
to
act
upon
it
though
only
a
short
while
previously
feeling
thoroughly
overcome
by
fatigue
he
had
resolved
to
wait
till
next
day
before
setting
out
for
the
chief
goal
of
his
long
pilgrimage
but
now
strangely
enough
all
sense
of
weariness
had
suddenly
left
him
a
keen
impatience
burned
in
his
veins
and
a
compelling
influence
stronger
than
himself
seemed
to
urge
him
on
to
the
instant
fulfillment
of
his
purpose
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
restless
he
became
and
the
more
eagerly
desirous
to
prove
with
the
least
possible
delay
the
truth
or
the
falsity
of
his
mystic
vision
at
danel
by
the
light
of
the
small
lamp
left
on
the
table
he
consulted
his
map
the
map
heliobas
had
traced
and
also
the
written
directions
that
accompanied
it
though
these
he
had
read
so
often
over
and
over
again
that
he
knew
them
by
heart
they
were
simply
and
concisely
worded
thus
on
the
east
bank
of
the
euphrates
nearly
opposite
the
there
is
the
sunken
fragment
of
a
bronze
gate
formerly
belonging
to
the
palace
of
the
babylonian
kings
three
miles
and
a
half
to
the
southwest
of
this
fragment
and
in
a
direct
line
with
it
straight
across
country
will
be
found
a
fallen
pillar
of
red
granite
half
buried
in
the
earth
the
square
tract
of
land
extending
beyond
this
broken
column
is
the
field
known
to
the
prophet
esdras
as
the
of
ardath
he
was
on
the
east
bank
of
the
euphrates
already
and
a
walk
of
three
miles
and
a
half
could
surely
be
accomplished
in
an
hour
or
very
little
over
that
time
hesitating
no
longer
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
house
deciding
that
if
he
met
elzear
he
would
say
he
was
going
for
a
moonlight
stroll
before
retiring
to
rest
that
venerable
recluse
however
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
as
the
door
of
the
hermitage
was
only
fastened
with
a
light
latch
he
had
no
difficulty
in
effecting
a
noiseless
exit
once
in
the
open
air
he
stopped
startled
by
the
sound
of
full
fresh
youthful
voices
singing
in
clear
and
harmonious
unison
kyrie
eleison
christe
eleison
kyrie
eleison
he
listened
looking
everywhere
about
him
in
utter
amazement
there
was
no
habitation
in
sight
save
elzear
and
the
chorus
certainly
did
not
proceed
from
thence
but
rather
seemed
to
rise
upward
through
the
earth
floating
in
released
sweet
echoes
to
and
fro
upon
the
hushed
air
kyrie
eleison
christe
eleison
how
it
swayed
about
him
like
a
close
chime
of
bells
he
stood
motionless
perplexed
and
wondering
was
there
a
subterranean
grotto
near
at
hand
where
devotional
chants
were
sung
or
and
a
slight
tremor
ran
through
him
at
the
thought
was
there
something
supernatural
in
the
music
notwithstanding
its
speech
and
sound
just
then
it
ceased
all
was
again
silent
as
before
and
angry
with
himself
for
his
own
foolish
fancies
he
set
about
the
task
of
discovering
the
sunken
fragment
heliobas
had
mentioned
very
soon
he
found
it
driven
deep
into
the
soil
and
so
blackened
and
defaced
by
time
that
it
was
impossible
to
trace
any
of
the
elaborate
carvings
that
must
have
once
adorned
it
in
fact
it
would
not
have
been
recognizable
as
a
portion
of
a
gate
at
all
had
it
not
still
possessed
an
enormous
hinge
which
partly
clung
to
it
by
means
of
one
huge
thickly
rusted
nail
dose
beside
it
grew
a
tree
of
weird
and
melancholy
appearance
its
trunk
was
split
asunder
and
one
half
of
it
was
withered
the
other
half
leaning
mournfully
on
one
side
bent
down
its
branches
to
the
ground
trailing
a
wealth
of
long
glossy
green
leaves
in
the
dust
of
the
ruined
city
this
was
the
famous
tree
called
by
the
natives
athel
of
which
old
legends
say
that
it
used
to
be
a
favorite
evergreen
much
cultivated
and
prized
by
the
babylonian
nobility
who
loving
its
pleasant
shade
spared
no
pains
to
make
it
grow
in
their
hanging
gardens
and
spacious
courts
though
its
nature
was
altogether
foreign
to
the
soil
and
now
with
none
to
tend
it
or
care
whether
it
flourishes
or
decays
it
faithfully
clings
to
the
deserted
spot
where
it
was
once
so
tenderly
fostered
showing
its
sympathy
with
the
surrounding
desolation
by
growing
always
in
split
halves
one
withered
and
one
green
a
creature
yet
loyal
to
the
memory
of
past
love
and
joy
alwyn
stood
under
its
dark
boughs
knowing
nothing
of
its
name
or
history
every
now
and
then
a
wailing
whisper
seemed
to
shudder
through
it
though
there
was
no
wind
and
he
heard
the
eerie
lamenting
sigh
with
an
involuntary
sense
of
awe
the
whole
scene
was
far
more
impressive
by
night
than
by
day
the
great
earth
mounds
of
babylon
looked
like
giant
graves
inclosing
a
glittering
ring
of
winding
waters
again
he
examined
the
imbedded
fragment
of
the
ancient
gate
and
then
feeling
quite
certain
of
his
he
set
his
face
steadily
toward
the
southwest
there
the
landscape
before
him
lay
flat
and
bare
in
the
beamy
lustre
of
the
moon
the
soil
was
sandy
and
heavy
to
the
tread
moreover
it
was
an
excessively
hot
night
too
hot
to
walk
fast
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
a
few
minutes
past
ten
keeping
up
the
moderate
pace
the
heat
enforced
it
was
possible
he
might
reach
the
mysterious
field
about
eleven
perhaps
earlier
and
now
his
nerves
began
to
quiver
with
strong
excitement
had
he
yielded
to
the
promptings
of
his
own
feverish
impatience
he
would
most
probably
have
run
all
the
way
in
spite
of
the
sultriness
of
the
air
but
he
restrained
this
impulse
and
walked
leisurely
on
purpose
reproaching
himself
as
he
went
along
for
the
utter
absurdity
of
his
expectations
was
ever
madman
more
mad
than
i
he
murmured
with
some
what
logical
human
being
in
his
right
mind
would
be
guilty
of
such
egregious
folly
but
am
i
logical
certainly
not
am
i
in
my
right
mind
i
think
i
am
yet
i
may
be
wrong
the
question
remains
what
is
logic
and
what
is
being
in
one
right
mind
no
one
can
absolutely
decide
let
me
see
if
i
can
review
calmly
my
ridiculous
position
it
comes
to
this
i
insist
on
being
mesmerized
i
have
a
dream
and
i
see
a
woman
in
the
dream
here
he
suddenly
corrected
himself
a
woman
did
i
say
no
she
was
something
far
more
than
that
a
lovely
phantom
a
dazzling
creature
of
my
own
imagination
an
exquisite
ideal
whom
i
will
one
day
immortalize
yes
immortalize
in
song
he
raised
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
to
the
dusky
firmament
thickly
studded
with
stars
and
just
then
caught
sight
of
a
fleecy
cloud
passing
swiftly
beneath
the
moon
and
floating
downwards
toward
the
earth
it
was
shaped
like
a
bird
and
was
here
and
there
tenderly
streaked
with
pink
as
though
it
had
just
travelled
from
some
distant
land
where
the
sun
was
rising
it
was
the
only
cloud
in
the
sky
and
it
had
a
peculiar
almost
phenomenal
effect
by
reason
of
its
rapid
motion
there
being
not
the
faintest
breeze
stirring
alwyn
watched
it
gliding
down
the
heavens
till
it
had
entirely
disappeared
and
then
began
his
meditations
anew
any
one
even
without
magnetic
influence
being
brought
to
bear
upon
him
might
have
visions
such
as
mine
take
an
for
instance
whose
life
is
one
long
confused
vista
of
visions
suppose
he
were
to
accept
all
the
wild
suggestions
offered
to
his
drugged
brain
and
persist
in
following
them
out
to
some
sort
of
definite
conclusion
the
only
place
for
that
man
would
be
a
lunatic
asylum
even
the
most
ordinary
persons
whose
minds
are
never
excited
in
any
abnormal
way
are
subject
to
very
curious
and
inexplicable
dreams
but
for
all
that
they
are
not
such
fools
as
to
believe
in
them
true
there
is
my
poem
i
do
know
how
i
wrote
it
yet
written
it
is
and
complete
from
beginning
to
end
an
actual
tangible
result
of
my
vision
and
strange
enough
in
its
way
to
say
the
least
of
it
but
what
is
stranger
still
is
that
i
love
the
radiant
phantom
that
i
saw
yes
actually
love
her
with
a
love
no
mere
woman
were
she
fair
as
helen
could
ever
arouse
in
me
of
course
in
spite
of
the
contrary
assertions
made
by
that
remarkably
interesting
chaldean
monk
heliobas
i
feel
i
am
the
victim
of
a
therefore
it
is
just
as
well
i
should
see
this
of
ardath
and
satisfy
myself
that
nothing
comes
of
it
in
which
case
i
shall
be
cured
of
my
craze
he
walked
on
for
some
time
and
presently
stopped
a
moment
to
examine
his
map
by
the
light
of
the
moon
as
he
did
so
he
became
aware
of
the
extraordinary
almost
terrible
stillness
surrounding
him
he
had
thought
the
hermitage
silent
as
a
closed
tomb
but
it
was
nothing
to
the
silence
here
he
felt
it
inclosing
him
like
a
thick
wall
on
all
sides
he
heard
the
regular
pulsations
of
his
own
heart
even
the
rushing
of
his
own
blood
but
no
other
sound
was
audible
earth
and
the
air
seemed
breathless
as
though
with
some
mysterious
excitement
the
stars
were
like
so
many
large
living
eyes
eagerly
gazing
down
on
the
solitary
human
being
who
thus
wandered
at
night
in
the
land
of
the
prophets
of
old
the
moon
itself
appeared
to
stare
at
him
in
open
wonderment
he
grew
uncomfortably
conscious
of
this
speechless
watchfulness
of
nature
he
strained
his
ears
to
listen
as
it
were
to
the
deepening
dumbness
of
all
existing
things
and
to
conquer
the
strange
sensations
that
were
overcoming
him
he
proceeded
at
a
more
rapid
pace
but
in
two
or
three
minutes
came
again
to
an
abrupt
halt
for
there
in
front
of
him
right
across
his
path
lay
the
fallen
pillar
which
according
to
heliobas
marked
the
boundary
to
the
field
he
sought
another
glance
at
his
map
decided
the
position
he
had
reached
his
journey
end
at
last
what
was
the
time
he
looked
it
was
just
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
a
curious
unnatural
calmness
suddenly
possessed
him
he
surveyed
with
a
quiet
almost
cold
unconcern
the
prospect
before
him
a
wide
level
square
of
land
covered
with
tufts
of
coarse
grass
and
clumps
of
wild
tamarisk
nothing
more
this
was
the
field
of
ardath
this
bare
unlovely
wilderness
without
so
much
as
a
tree
to
grace
its
outline
from
where
he
stood
he
could
view
its
whole
extent
and
as
he
beheld
its
complete
desolation
he
smiled
a
faint
smile
he
thought
of
the
words
in
the
ancient
book
of
esdras
and
the
angel
bade
me
enter
a
waste
field
and
the
field
was
barren
and
dry
save
of
herbs
and
the
name
of
the
field
was
ardath
and
i
wandered
therein
through
the
hours
of
the
long
night
and
the
silver
eyes
of
the
field
did
open
before
me
and
therein
i
saw
signs
and
wonders
yes
the
field
is
and
dry
enough
in
all
conscience
he
murmured
listlessly
but
as
for
the
eyes
and
the
and
wonders
they
must
have
existed
only
in
the
venerable
imagination
just
as
my
exists
in
mine
well
now
theos
alwyn
he
continued
apostrophizing
himself
aloud
are
you
contented
are
you
quite
convinced
of
your
folly
and
do
you
acknowledge
that
a
fair
dream
is
as
much
of
a
lie
and
a
cheat
as
all
the
other
things
that
puzzle
and
torture
poor
human
nature
return
to
your
former
condition
of
reasoning
and
reasonable
skepticism
aye
even
atheism
if
you
will
for
the
materialists
are
right
you
can
not
prove
a
god
or
the
possibility
of
any
purely
spiritual
life
why
thus
hanker
after
a
phantom
loveliness
fame
fame
win
fame
that
is
enough
for
you
in
this
world
and
as
for
a
next
world
who
believes
in
it
and
who
believing
cares
soliloquizing
in
this
fashion
he
set
his
foot
on
ardath
itself
determining
to
walk
across
and
around
it
from
end
to
end
the
grass
was
long
and
dry
yet
it
made
no
rustle
beneath
his
tread
he
seemed
to
be
shod
with
the
magic
shoes
of
silence
he
walked
on
till
he
reached
about
the
middle
of
the
field
where
perceiving
a
broad
flat
stone
near
him
he
sat
down
to
rest
there
was
a
light
mist
rising
a
thin
vapor
that
crept
slowly
upward
from
the
ground
and
remained
hovering
like
a
wide
gossamer
web
some
two
or
three
inches
above
it
thus
giving
a
cool
luminous
watery
effect
to
the
hot
and
arid
soil
according
to
the
apocrypha
esdras
among
the
flowers
he
idly
mused
well
perhaps
there
were
flowers
in
those
days
but
it
is
very
evident
there
are
none
now
a
more
dreary
utterly
desolate
place
than
this
famous
i
have
never
seen
at
that
moment
a
subtle
fragrance
scented
the
still
air
a
fragrance
deliciously
sweet
as
of
violets
mingled
with
myrtle
he
inhaled
the
delicate
odor
surprised
and
confounded
flowers
after
all
he
exclaimed
or
maybe
some
aromatic
herb
and
he
bent
down
to
examine
the
turf
at
his
feet
to
his
amazement
he
perceived
a
thick
cluster
of
white
blossoms
and
with
deep
golden
centres
wherein
bright
drops
of
dew
sparkled
like
brilliants
and
from
whence
puffs
of
perfume
rose
like
incense
swung
at
unseen
altars
he
looked
at
them
in
doubt
that
was
almost
dread
were
they
real
were
these
the
silver
eyes
in
which
esdras
had
seen
signs
and
wonders
or
was
he
hopelessly
with
delusions
and
dreaming
again
he
touched
them
hesitatingly
they
were
actual
living
things
with
creamy
petals
soft
as
velvet
he
was
about
to
gather
one
of
them
when
all
at
once
his
attention
was
caught
and
riveted
by
something
like
a
faint
shadow
gliding
across
the
plain
a
smothered
cry
escaped
his
lips
he
sprang
erect
and
gazed
eagerly
forward
half
in
hope
half
in
fear
what
slight
figure
was
that
pacing
slowly
serenely
and
all
alone
in
the
moonlight
without
another
pause
he
rushed
impetuously
toward
it
heedless
that
as
he
went
he
trod
on
thousands
of
those
strange
starry
blossoms
which
now
with
sudden
growth
covered
and
whitened
every
inch
of
the
ground
thus
marvellously
fulfilling
the
words
spoken
of
old
behold
the
field
thou
thoughest
barren
how
great
a
glory
hath
the
moon

chapter
x
god
maiden
edris
he
ran
on
swiftly
for
a
few
paces
then
coming
more
closely
in
view
of
the
misty
shape
he
pursued
he
checked
himself
abruptly
and
stood
still
his
heart
sinking
with
a
bitter
and
irrepressible
sense
of
disappointment
here
surely
was
no
angel
wanderer
from
unseen
spheres
only
a
girl
clad
in
floating
gray
draperies
that
clung
softly
to
her
slim
figure
and
trailed
behind
her
as
she
moved
sedately
along
through
the
blossoms
that
bent
beneath
her
noiseless
tread
he
had
no
eyes
for
the
strange
of
the
lately
barren
land
all
his
interest
was
centered
on
the
slender
graceful
form
of
the
mysterious
maiden
she
meanwhile
went
on
her
way
till
she
reached
the
western
boundary
of
the
field
there
she
turned
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
came
back
straight
toward
him
he
watched
her
approach
as
though
she
were
some
invisible
fate
and
a
tremor
shook
his
limbs
as
she
drew
nearer
still
nearer
he
could
see
her
distinctly
now
all
but
her
face
that
was
in
shadow
for
her
head
was
bent
and
her
eyes
were
downcast
her
long
fair
hair
flowed
in
a
loose
rippling
mass
over
her
shoulders
she
wore
a
wreath
of
the
ardath
flowers
and
carried
a
cluster
of
them
clasped
between
her
small
daintily
shaped
hands
a
few
steps
more
and
she
was
close
beside
him
she
stopped
as
if
in
expectation
of
some
word
or
sign
but
he
stood
mute
and
motionless
not
daring
to
speak
or
stir
then
without
raising
her
eyes
she
passed
passed
like
a
flitting
vapor
and
he
remained
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
in
a
sort
of
vague
dumb
bewilderment
his
stupefaction
was
brief
however
rousing
himself
to
swift
resolution
he
hastened
after
her
stay
stay
he
cried
aloud
obedient
to
his
call
she
paused
but
did
not
turn
he
came
up
with
her
he
caught
at
her
robe
soft
to
the
touch
as
silken
gauze
and
overwhelmed
by
a
sudden
emotion
of
awe
and
reverence
he
sank
on
his
knees
who
and
what
are
you
he
murmured
in
trembling
tones
tell
me
if
you
are
mortal
maid
i
will
not
harm
you
i
swear
see
i
am
only
a
poor
crazed
fool
that
loves
a
dream
that
stakes
his
life
upon
a
chance
of
heaven
pity
me
as
you
are
gentle
but
do
not
fear
me
only
speak
no
answer
came
he
looked
up
and
now
in
the
rich
radiance
of
the
moon
beheld
her
face
how
like
and
yet
how
altogether
unlike
it
was
to
the
face
of
the
angel
in
his
vision
for
that
ethereal
being
had
seemed
dazzlingly
supremely
beautiful
beyond
all
mortal
power
of
description
whereas
this
girl
was
simply
fair
small
and
delicate
with
something
wistful
and
pathetic
in
the
lines
of
her
sweet
mouth
and
shadows
as
of
remembered
sorrows
slumbering
in
the
depths
of
her
serene
eyes
her
fragile
figure
drooped
wearily
as
though
she
were
exhausted
by
some
long
fatigue
yet
gazing
down
upon
him
she
smiled
and
in
that
smile
the
faint
resemblance
she
bore
to
his
flashed
out
like
a
beam
of
sunlight
though
it
vanished
again
as
quickly
as
it
had
shone
he
waited
eagerly
to
hear
her
voice
waited
in
a
sort
of
breathless
suspense
but
as
she
still
kept
silence
he
sprang
up
from
his
kneeling
attitude
and
seized
her
hands
how
soft
they
were
and
warm
he
folded
them
in
his
own
and
drew
her
closer
to
himself
the
flowers
she
held
fell
from
her
grasp
and
lay
in
a
tumbled
fragrant
heap
between
them
his
brain
was
in
a
whirl
the
past
and
the
future
the
real
and
the
unreal
the
finite
and
the
infinite
seemed
all
merging
into
one
another
without
any
shade
of
difference
or
division
we
have
met
very
strangely
you
and
i
he
said
scarcely
conscious
of
the
words
he
uttered
will
you
not
tell
me
your
name
a
faint
sigh
escaped
her
my
name
is
edris
she
answered
in
low
musical
accents
that
carried
to
his
sense
of
hearing
a
suggestion
of
something
sweet
and
familiar
edris
he
repeated
edris
and
gazing
at
her
dreamily
he
raised
her
hands
to
his
lips
and
kissed
them
gently
my
fairest
edris
from
whence
do
you
come
she
met
his
eyes
with
a
mild
look
of
reproach
and
wonderment
from
a
far
far
country
theos
and
he
started
as
she
thus
addressed
him
a
land
where
no
love
is
wasted
and
no
promise
forgotten
again
that
mystic
light
passed
over
her
pale
face
the
she
wore
seemed
for
a
moment
to
glitter
like
a
circlet
of
stars
his
heart
beat
quickly
could
he
believe
her
was
she
in
very
truth
that
shining
peri
whose
aerial
loveliness
had
so
long
haunted
his
imagination
nay
it
was
impossible
for
if
she
were
why
should
she
veil
her
native
glory
in
such
simple
maiden
guise
searchingly
he
studied
every
feature
of
her
countenance
and
as
he
did
so
his
doubts
concerning
her
became
more
and
more
confirmed
she
was
a
living
breathing
woman
an
actual
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
yet
how
account
for
her
appearance
on
the
field
of
ardath
this
puzzled
him
till
all
at
once
a
logical
explanation
of
the
whole
mystery
dawned
upon
his
mind
heliobas
had
sent
her
hither
on
purpose
to
meet
him
of
course
how
dense
he
had
been
not
to
see
through
so
transparent
a
scheme
before
the
clever
chaldean
had
resolved
that
he
theos
alwyn
should
somehow
be
brought
to
accept
his
trance
as
a
real
experience
so
that
henceforth
his
faith
in
things
unseen
and
eternal
might
be
assured
many
psychological
theorists
would
uphold
such
a
deceit
as
not
only
permissible
but
even
if
practiced
for
the
furtherance
of
a
good
cause
even
the
venerable
hermit
elzear
might
have
shared
in
the
conspiracy
and
this
edris
as
she
called
herself
was
no
doubt
perfectly
trained
in
the
part
she
had
to
play
a
plot
for
his
conversion
well
he
would
enter
into
it
himself
he
resolved
why
not
the
girl
was
exquisitely
fair
a
veritable
psyche
of
soft
charms
and
a
little
lovemaking
by
moonlight
would
do
no
harm
here
he
suddenly
became
aware
that
while
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
his
brain
he
had
unconsciously
allowed
her
hands
to
slip
from
his
hold
and
she
now
stood
apart
at
some
little
distance
her
eyes
fixed
full
upon
him
with
an
expression
of
most
plaintive
piteousness
he
made
a
hasty
step
or
two
toward
her
and
as
he
did
so
his
pulses
began
to
throb
with
an
extraordinary
sensation
of
pleasure
pleasure
so
keen
as
to
be
almost
pain
edris
he
whispered
edris
and
stopped
irresolutely
she
looked
up
at
him
with
the
appealing
wistfulness
of
a
lost
and
suffering
child
and
a
slight
shudder
ran
through
all
her
delicate
frame
i
am
cold
theos
she
murmured
half
beseechingly
stretching
out
her
hands
to
him
once
more
hands
as
fine
and
fair
as
little
white
hands
which
he
gazed
at
wonderingly
yet
did
not
cold
and
very
weary
the
way
has
been
long
and
the
earth
is
dark
dark
repeated
alwyn
mechanically
still
absorbed
in
the
dubious
contemplation
of
her
lovely
yielding
form
her
sweet
upturned
face
and
hair
dark
here
beneath
the
brightness
of
the
moon
nay
i
have
seen
many
a
full
day
look
less
radiant
than
this
night
of
stars
her
eyes
dwelt
upon
him
with
a
certain
pathetic
bewilderment
she
let
her
extended
arms
drop
wearily
at
her
sides
and
a
shadow
of
pained
recollection
crossed
the
fairness
of
her
features
ah
i
forgot
and
she
sighed
deeply
this
is
that
strange
sad
world
where
darkness
is
called
light
at
these
words
uttered
with
so
much
sorrowful
meaning
a
quick
thrill
stirred
alwyn
blood
an
inexplicable
sharp
thrill
that
was
like
the
touch
of
scorching
flame
he
gazed
at
her
perplexedly
his
pride
resented
what
he
imagined
to
be
the
deception
practiced
upon
him
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
insensible
to
the
weird
romance
of
the
situation
he
began
to
consider
that
as
this
fair
girl
trained
so
admirably
in
mystical
speech
and
manner
had
evidently
been
sent
on
purpose
to
meet
him
he
could
scarcely
be
blamed
for
taking
her
as
she
presented
herself
and
enjoying
to
the
full
a
thoroughly
novel
and
picturesque
adventure
his
eyes
flashed
as
he
surveyed
her
standing
there
before
him
utterly
unprotected
and
at
his
mercy
his
old
languid
skeptical
smile
played
on
his
proud
lips
that
smile
of
the
marble
antinous
which
says
bring
me
face
to
face
with
truth
itself
and
i
shall
still
doubt
an
expression
of
reluctant
admiration
and
awakening
passion
dawned
on
his
countenance
he
was
about
to
speak
when
she
whose
looks
were
fastened
on
him
with
intense
powerful
watchful
anxious
entreaty
suddenly
wrung
her
hands
together
as
though
in
despair
and
gave
vent
to
a
desolate
sobbing
cry
that
smote
him
to
the
very
heart
theos
theos
and
her
voice
pealed
out
on
the
breathless
air
in
sweet
melodious
broken
oh
my
unfaithful
beloved
what
can
i
do
for
thee
a
love
unseen
thou
wilt
not
understand
a
love
made
manifest
thou
wilt
not
recognize
alas
my
journey
is
in
vain
my
errand
hopeless
for
while
thine
unbelief
resists
my
pleading
how
can
i
lead
thee
from
danger
into
safety
how
bridge
the
depths
between
our
parted
souls
how
win
for
thee
pardon
and
blessing
from
christ
the
king
bright
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
fell
fast
and
thick
through
her
long
drooping
lashes
and
alwyn
smitten
with
remorse
at
the
sight
of
such
grief
sprang
to
her
side
overcome
by
shame
love
and
penitence
weeping
and
for
me
he
exclaimed
sweet
edris
gentlest
of
maidens
weep
not
for
one
unworthy
but
rather
smile
and
speak
again
of
love
and
now
his
words
pouring
forth
impetuously
seemed
to
utter
themselves
independently
of
any
previous
thought
yes
speak
only
of
love
and
the
discourse
of
those
tuneful
lips
shall
be
my
gospel
the
glance
of
those
soft
eyes
my
creed
and
as
for
pardon
and
blessing
i
crave
none
but
thine
i
sought
a
i
have
found
a
fair
reality
a
living
proof
of
love
divine
omnipotence
love
is
the
only
god
who
would
doubt
his
sovereignty
or
grudge
him
his
full
measure
of
worship
not
i
believe
me
and
carried
away
by
the
force
of
a
resistless
inward
fervor
he
threw
himself
once
more
at
her
feet
see
here
do
i
pay
my
vows
at
love
high
altar
heart
desire
shall
be
the
prayer
heart
ecstasy
the
praise
together
we
will
celebrate
our
glad
service
of
love
and
heaven
itself
shall
sanctify
this
eve
of
edris
and
all
angels
she
listened
looking
down
upon
him
with
grave
half
timid
tenderness
her
tears
dried
and
a
sudden
hope
irradiated
her
fair
face
with
a
soft
bright
flush
as
lovely
as
the
light
of
morning
falling
on
newly
opened
flowers
when
he
ceased
she
spoke
her
accents
breaking
through
the
silence
like
clear
notes
of
music
sweetly
sung
so
be
it
she
said
may
heaven
truly
sanctify
all
pure
thoughts
and
free
the
soul
of
my
beloved
from
sin
and
slowly
bending
forward
as
a
delicate
bends
to
the
sway
of
the
wind
she
laid
her
hands
about
his
neck
and
touched
his
lips
with
her
own
ah
what
divine
ecstasy
what
wild
and
fiery
transport
filled
him
then
her
kiss
like
a
penetrating
pierced
to
the
very
centre
of
his
being
the
moonbeams
swam
round
him
in
eddying
circles
of
gold
the
white
field
heaved
to
and
fro
he
caught
her
waist
and
clung
to
her
and
in
the
burning
marvel
of
that
moment
he
forget
everything
save
that
whether
spirit
or
mortal
she
was
in
woman
witching
shape
and
that
all
the
glamour
of
her
beauty
was
his
for
this
one
night
at
least
this
night
which
now
in
the
speechless
glorious
delirium
of
love
that
overwhelmed
him
seemed
like
the
mahometan
night
of
better
than
a
thousand
months
drawn
to
her
by
some
subtle
mysterious
attraction
which
he
could
neither
explain
nor
control
and
absorbed
in
a
rapture
beyond
all
that
his
highest
and
most
daring
flights
of
poetical
fancy
had
ever
conceived
he
felt
as
though
his
very
life
were
ebbing
out
of
him
to
become
part
of
hers
and
this
thought
was
strangely
sweet
a
perfect
consummation
of
all
his
best
desires
all
at
once
a
cold
shudder
ran
freezingly
through
his
veins
a
something
chill
and
impalpable
appeared
to
pass
between
him
and
her
caressing
arms
his
limbs
grew
numb
and
heavy
his
sight
began
to
fail
him
he
was
sinking
sinking
he
knew
not
where
when
suddenly
she
withdrew
herself
from
his
embrace
instantly
his
strength
came
back
to
him
with
a
rush
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
erect
breathless
dizzy
and
confused
his
pulses
beating
like
and
every
fiber
in
his
frame
quivering
with
excitement
entranced
impassioned
elated
filled
with
unutterable
incomprehensible
joy
he
would
have
clasped
her
again
to
his
heart
but
she
retreated
swiftly
from
him
and
standing
several
paces
off
motioned
him
not
to
approach
her
more
nearly
he
scarcely
heeded
her
warning
gesture
plunging
recklessly
through
the
flowers
he
had
almost
reached
her
side
when
to
his
amazement
and
fear
his
eager
progress
was
stopped
stopped
by
some
invisible
intangible
barrier
which
despite
all
his
efforts
forcibly
prevented
him
from
advancing
one
step
further
she
was
close
within
an
arm
length
of
him
and
yet
he
could
not
touch
her
nothing
apparently
divided
them
save
a
small
breadth
of
the
ardath
blossoms
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
nevertheless
that
invincible
influence
thrust
him
back
and
held
him
fast
as
though
he
were
chained
to
the
ground
with
weights
of
iron
edris
he
cried
loudly
his
former
transport
of
delight
changed
into
edris
come
to
me
i
can
not
come
to
you
what
is
this
that
parts
us
death
she
and
the
solemn
word
seemed
to
toll
slowly
through
the
still
air
like
a
knell
he
stood
bewildered
and
dismayed
death
what
could
she
mean
what
in
the
name
of
all
her
beautiful
delicate
glowing
youth
had
she
to
do
with
death
gazing
at
her
in
mute
wonder
he
saw
her
stoop
and
gather
one
flower
from
the
clusters
growing
thickly
around
her
she
held
it
shieldwise
against
her
breast
where
it
shone
like
a
large
white
jewel
and
regarded
him
with
sweet
wistful
eyes
full
of
a
mournful
longing
death
lies
between
us
my
beloved
she
continued
one
line
of
shadow
only
one
little
line
but
thou
mayest
not
pass
it
save
when
god
commands
and
i
i
can
not
for
i
know
naught
of
death
save
that
it
is
a
heavy
dreamless
sleep
allotted
to
mortals
wherein
they
gain
brief
rest
many
lives
lives
that
like
recurring
dawns
rouse
them
anew
to
labor
how
often
hast
thou
slept
thus
my
theos
and
forgotten
me
she
paused
and
alwyn
met
her
clear
steadfast
looks
with
a
swift
glance
of
something
like
defiance
for
as
she
spoke
his
previous
idea
concerning
her
came
back
upon
him
with
redoubled
force
he
was
keenly
conscious
of
the
vehement
fever
of
love
into
which
her
presence
had
thrown
him
but
all
the
same
he
was
unable
to
dispossess
himself
of
the
notion
that
she
was
a
pupil
and
an
accomplice
of
heliobas
thoroughly
trained
and
practiced
in
his
mysterious
doctrine
and
that
therefore
she
most
probably
had
some
magnetic
power
in
herself
that
at
her
pleasure
not
only
attracted
him
to
her
but
also
held
him
thus
motionless
at
a
distance
from
her
she
talked
of
course
in
an
indefinite
mystic
way
either
to
intimidate
or
convince
him
but
and
he
smiled
a
in
any
case
it
only
rested
with
himself
to
unmask
this
graceful
pretender
to
angelic
honors
and
while
he
thought
thus
her
soft
tones
trembled
on
the
silence
again
he
listened
as
a
dreaming
mariner
might
listen
to
the
fancied
singing
of
the
through
long
bright
aeons
of
endless
glory
she
said
i
have
waited
and
prayed
for
thee
i
have
pleaded
thy
cause
before
the
blinding
splendors
of
god
throne
i
have
sung
the
songs
of
thy
native
paradise
but
thou
grown
dull
of
hearing
hast
caught
but
the
echo
of
the
music
life
after
life
hast
thou
lived
and
given
no
thought
to
me
yet
i
remember
and
am
faithful
heaven
is
not
all
heaven
to
me
without
thee
my
beloved
and
now
in
this
time
of
thy
last
probation
now
if
thou
lovest
me
indeed
love
thee
suddenly
exclaimed
theos
half
beside
himself
with
the
strange
passion
of
yearning
her
words
awakened
in
him
love
thee
edris
aye
as
the
gods
loved
when
earth
was
young
with
the
fullness
of
the
heart
and
the
vigor
of
glad
life
even
so
i
love
thee
what
sayest
thou
of
heaven
heaven
is
here
here
on
this
bridal
field
of
ardath
with
stars
come
sweet
one
cease
to
play
this
mystic
midnight
fantasy
i
have
done
with
dreams
edris
be
thyself
for
them
art
woman
not
angel
thy
kiss
was
warm
as
wine
nay
why
shrink
from
me
this
as
she
retreated
still
further
away
her
eyes
flashing
with
unearthly
brilliancy
i
will
make
thee
a
queen
fair
edris
as
poets
ever
make
queens
of
the
women
they
love
my
fame
shall
be
a
crown
for
thee
to
wear
a
crown
that
the
whole
world
gazing
on
shall
envy
and
in
the
heat
and
ardor
of
the
moment
forgetful
of
the
unseen
barrier
that
divided
her
from
him
he
made
a
violent
effort
to
spring
forward
when
lo
a
wave
of
rippling
light
appeared
to
break
from
beneath
her
feet
it
rolled
toward
him
and
completely
flooded
the
space
between
them
like
a
glittering
pool
and
in
it
the
flowers
of
ardath
swayed
to
and
fro
as
on
a
woodland
lake
sway
to
the
measured
dash
of
passing
oars
starting
back
with
a
cry
of
terror
he
gazed
wildly
on
this
miracle
a
voice
richer
than
all
music
rang
silvery
clear
across
the
liquid
radiance
fame
said
the
voice
wouldst
thou
crown
me
theos
with
so
perishable
a
diadem
paralyzed
and
speechless
he
lifted
his
straining
dazzled
eyes
was
that
edris
that
lustrous
figure
delicate
as
a
with
the
sun
shining
through
he
stared
upon
her
as
a
dying
man
might
stare
for
the
last
time
on
the
face
of
his
nearest
and
dearest
he
saw
her
soft
gray
garments
change
to
glistening
white
the
wreath
she
wore
sparkled
as
with
a
million
a
roseate
halo
streamed
above
her
and
around
her
long
streaks
of
crimson
flared
down
the
sky
like
threads
of
fire
swung
from
the
stars
and
in
the
deepening
glory
her
countenance
divinely
beautiful
yet
intensely
sad
expressed
the
touching
hope
and
fear
of
one
who
makes
a
final
farewell
appeal
ah
god
he
knew
her
now
too
late
too
late
he
knew
her
the
angel
of
his
vision
stood
before
him
and
humbled
to
the
very
dust
and
ashes
of
despair
he
loathed
himself
for
his
unworthiness
and
lack
of
faith
o
doubting
and
unhappy
one
she
went
on
in
accents
sweeter
than
a
chime
of
golden
bells
thou
art
lost
in
the
gloom
of
the
sorrowful
star
where
naught
is
known
of
life
save
its
shadow
and
as
yet
i
can
not
rescue
thee
ah
forlorn
edris
that
i
am
left
lonely
up
in
heaven
but
prayers
are
heard
and
god
great
patience
never
tires
learn
therefore
the
perils
of
the
past
the
perils
of
the
future
and
weigh
against
an
immortal
destiny
of
love
the
worth
of
fame
wider
and
more
dazzling
grew
the
brilliancy
surrounding
her
raising
her
eyes
she
clasped
her
hands
in
an
attitude
of
impassioned
supplication
o
fair
king
christ
she
cried
and
her
voice
seemed
to
strike
a
melodious
passage
through
the
thou
canst
prevail
a
burst
of
music
answered
her
music
that
rushed
downwards
and
swept
in
strong
vibrating
chords
over
the
land
again
the
kyrie
eleison
christe
eleison
kyrie
eleison
pealed
forth
in
the
same
full
chorus
that
had
before
sounded
so
mysteriously
outside
elzear
hermitage
and
the
separate
crimson
rays
glittering
about
her
radiant
figure
suddenly
melted
all
together
in
the
form
of
a
great
cross
which
absorbing
moon
and
stars
in
its
fiery
redness
blazed
from
end
to
end
of
the
eastern
horizon
then
like
a
fair
white
dove
or
delicate
butterfly
she
rose
she
poised
herself
above
the
bowing
ardath
bloom
anon
soaring
aloft
she
floated
higher
higher
and
ever
higher
serenely
and
with
aerial
slow
ease
till
drawn
into
the
glory
of
that
wondrous
flaming
cross
whose
outstretched
beams
seemed
waiting
to
receive
her
she
drifted
straight
up
wards
through
its
very
centre
and
so
vanished
theos
stared
aghast
at
the
glowing
sky
whither
had
she
gone
her
words
still
rang
in
his
ears
the
warmth
of
her
kiss
still
lingered
on
his
lips
he
loved
her
he
worshipped
her
why
why
had
she
left
him
lost
as
she
herself
had
said
in
a
world
that
was
mere
emptiness
without
her
he
struggled
for
utterance
edris
he
whispered
hoarsely
edris
my
come
back
come
back
pity
me
forgive
edris
his
voice
died
in
a
hard
sob
of
imploring
agony
smitten
to
the
very
soul
by
a
remorse
greater
than
he
could
bear
his
strength
failed
him
and
he
fell
senseless
face
forward
among
the
flowers
of
the
field
flowers
that
circling
snowily
around
his
dark
and
prostrate
form
looked
like
fairy
garlands
bordering
a
poet
grave
part
in
that
which
hath
been
is
now
and
that
which
is
to
be
hath
already
been
and

requireth
that
which

hushing
lethean
calm
even
so
it
was
with
theos
alwyn
drowned
in
the
deep
stillness
of
a
merciful
swoon
he
had
sunk
as
it
were
out
of
life
far
out
of
the
furthest
reach
or
sense
of
time
in
some
vast
unsounded
gulf
of
shadows
where
earth
and
heaven
were
alike
forgotten
how
long
he
lay
thus
he
never
knew
but
he
was
roused
at
roused
by
the
pressure
of
something
cold
and
sharp
against
his
throat
and
on
languidly
opening
his
eyes
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
a
small
body
of
men
in
armor
who
leaning
on
tall
pikes
which
glistened
brilliantly
in
the
full
sunlight
surveyed
him
with
looks
of
derisive
amusement
one
of
these
closer
to
him
than
the
rest
and
who
seemed
from
his
dress
and
bearing
to
be
some
officer
in
authority
held
instead
of
a
pike
a
short
sword
the
touch
of
whose
pointed
steel
blade
had
been
the
effectual
means
of
awakening
him
from
his
lethargy
how
now
said
this
personage
in
a
rough
voice
as
he
withdrew
his
weapon
what
idle
fellow
art
thou
traitor
or
spy
fool
thou
must
be
and
breaker
of
the
king
law
else
thou
hadst
never
dared
to
bask
in
such
ease
outside
the
gates
of
the
magnificent
the
magnificent
what
was
the
man
talking
about
uttering
a
hasty
exclamation
alwyn
staggered
to
his
feet
with
an
effort
and
shading
his
eyes
from
the
hot
glare
of
the
sun
stared
bewilderedly
at
his
interlocutor
is
this
he
stammered
dreamily
i
do
not
understand
you
i
have
slept
on
the
field
of
ardath
the
soldiers
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
in
which
their
leader
joined
thou
hast
drunk
deep
my
friend
he
observed
putting
up
his
sword
with
a
sharp
clatter
into
its
shining
sheath
what
name
sayst
thou
ardath
we
know
it
not
nor
dost
thou
i
warrant
when
sober
go
to
make
for
thy
home
speedily
aye
aye
the
flavor
of
good
wine
clings
to
thy
mouth
still
is
a
pleasant
sweetness
that
i
myself
am
partial
to
and
i
can
pardon
those
who
like
thee
love
it
somewhat
too
well
away
and
thank
the
gods
thou
hast
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
king
guard
rather
then
lysia
priestly
patrol
see
the
gates
are
open
in
with
thee
and
cool
thy
head
at
the
first
fountain
the
gates
what
gates
removing
his
hand
from
his
eyes
alwyn
gazed
around
confusedly
he
was
standing
on
an
open
stretch
of
level
road
and
dry
with
heat
and
right
in
front
of
him
was
an
enormously
high
wall
topped
with
rows
of
bristling
iron
spikes
and
guarded
by
the
gates
alluded
to
huge
massive
portals
seemingly
made
of
finely
molded
brass
and
embellished
on
either
side
by
thick
round
stone
watch
towers
from
whose
summits
scarlet
pennons
drooped
idly
in
the
windless
air
amazed
and
full
of
a
vague
trembling
terror
he
fixed
his
wondering
looks
once
more
upon
his
strange
companions
who
in
their
turn
regarded
him
with
cool
military
indifference
i
must
be
mad
or
dreaming
he
thought
then
growing
suddenly
desperate
he
stretched
out
his
hands
with
a
wild
appealing
gesture
i
swear
to
you
i
know
nothing
of
this
place
he
cried
i
never
saw
it
before
some
trick
has
been
played
on
me
who
brought
me
here
where
is
elzear
the
hermit
the
ruins
of
babylon
where
is
good
god
what
fearful
freak
of
fate
is
this
the
soldiers
laughed
again
their
commander
looked
at
him
a
little
curiously
nay
art
thou
one
of
the
escaped
of
lysia
lovers
he
asked
suspiciously
and
has
the
silver
nectar
failed
of
its
usual
action
and
driven
thy
senses
to
the
winds
that
thou
ravest
thus
for
if
thou
art
a
stranger
and
knowest
naught
of
us
how
speakest
thou
our
language
why
wearest
thou
the
garb
of
our
citizens
alwyn
shrank
and
shivered
as
though
he
had
received
a
deadening
blow
an
awful
inexplicable
chill
horror
froze
his
blood
it
was
true
he
understood
the
language
spoken
it
was
perfectly
familiar
to
him
more
so
than
his
own
native
tongue
stop
what
was
his
native
tongue
he
tried
to
think
and
the
sick
fear
at
his
heart
grew
stronger
he
could
not
remember
a
word
of
it
and
his
dress
he
glanced
at
it
dismayed
and
appalled
he
had
not
noticed
it
till
now
it
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
costume
of
ancient
greece
and
consisted
of
a
white
linen
tunic
and
loose
upper
vest
both
garments
being
kept
in
place
by
a
belt
of
silver
from
this
belt
depended
a
sheathed
dagger
a
square
writing
tablet
and
a
implement
which
he
immediately
recognized
as
the
antique
form
of
stylus
his
feet
were
shod
with
sandals
his
arms
were
bare
to
the
shoulder
and
clasped
at
the
upper
part
by
two
broad
silver
armlets
richly
chased
noting
all
these
details
the
fantastic
awfulness
of
his
position
smote
him
with
redoubled
force
and
he
felt
as
a
madman
may
feel
when
his
impending
doom
has
not
entirely
asserted
itself
when
only
grotesque
and
leering
suggestions
of
madness
cloud
his
brain
when
hideous
faces
dimly
discerned
loom
out
of
the
chaos
of
his
nightly
visions
and
when
all
the
air
seems
solid
darkness
with
one
white
line
of
fire
cracking
it
asunder
in
the
midst
and
that
the
fire
of
his
own
approaching
frenzy
such
a
delirium
of
agony
possessed
alwyn
at
that
moment
he
could
have
shrieked
laughed
groaned
wept
and
fallen
down
in
the
dust
before
these
bearded
armed
men
praying
them
to
slay
him
with
their
weapons
there
where
he
stood
and
put
him
mercifully
and
at
once
out
of
his
mysterious
misery
but
an
invisible
influence
stronger
than
himself
prevented
him
from
becoming
altogether
the
victim
of
his
own
torturing
emotions
and
he
remained
erect
and
still
as
a
marble
figure
with
a
wondering
white
piteous
face
of
such
unutterable
affliction
that
the
officer
who
watched
him
seemed
touched
and
advancing
clapped
his
shoulder
in
a
friendly
manner
come
come
he
said
thou
fear
nothing
we
are
not
the
men
to
blab
of
thy
trespass
against
the
city
edict
for
of
a
truth
there
is
too
much
whispering
away
of
young
and
goodly
lives
nowadays
what
thou
art
not
the
first
gay
gallant
nor
wilt
thou
be
the
last
that
has
seen
the
world
turn
upside
down
in
a
haze
of
love
and
late
feasting
if
thou
hast
not
slept
long
enough
why
sleep
again
an
thou
wilt
but
not
here
he
broke
off
abruptly
a
distant
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
was
heard
as
of
one
galloping
at
full
speed
the
soldiers
started
and
assumed
an
attitude
of
attention
their
leader
muttered
something
like
an
oath
and
seizing
alwyn
by
the
arm
hurried
him
to
the
brass
gates
which
as
he
had
said
stood
open
and
literally
thrust
him
through
in
in
my
lad
he
urged
with
rough
kindliness
thou
hast
a
face
fairer
than
that
of
the
king
own
minstrel
and
why
wouldst
thou
die
for
sake
of
an
extra
cup
of
wine
if
lysia
is
to
blame
for
this
scattering
of
thy
wits
take
heed
thou
do
not
venture
near
her
more
it
is
ill
jesting
with
the
serpent
sting
get
thee
hence
quickly
and
be
glad
of
thy
life
thou
hast
many
years
before
thee
yet
in
which
to
play
the
lover
and
fool
with
this
enigmatical
speech
he
signed
to
his
men
to
follow
him
they
all
filed
through
the
gates
which
closed
after
them
with
a
jarring
clang
a
dark
bearded
face
peered
out
of
a
narrow
loophole
in
one
of
the
and
a
deep
voice
called
what
of
the
hour
the
officer
raised
his
gauntleted
hand
and
answered
promptly
peace
and
safety
salutation
cried
the
voice
again
salutation
responded
the
officer
and
with
a
reassuring
nod
and
smile
to
the
bewildered
alwyn
he
gathered
his
little
band
around
him
and
they
all
marched
off
the
measured
of
their
footsteps
making
metallic
music
as
they
wheeled
round
a
corner
and
disappeared
from
sight
left
to
himself
alwyn
first
idea
was
to
sit
down
in
some
quiet
corner
and
endeavor
calmly
to
realize
what
strange
and
cruel
thing
had
chanced
to
him
but
happening
to
look
up
he
saw
the
bearded
face
in
the
watchtower
observing
him
suspiciously
he
therefore
roused
himself
sufficiently
to
walk
away
on
and
on
scarce
heeding
whither
he
went
till
he
had
completely
lost
sight
of
those
great
portals
which
had
shut
him
against
his
will
within
the
walls
of
a
large
splendid
and
populous
city
yes
hopelessly
perplexing
and
maddening
as
it
was
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
this
fact
and
though
he
again
and
again
tried
to
convince
himself
that
he
was
laboring
under
some
wild
and
exceptional
hallucination
his
senses
all
gave
evidence
of
the
actual
reality
of
his
situation
he
felt
he
moved
he
heard
he
saw
he
was
even
beginning
to
be
conscious
of
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
the
further
he
went
the
more
gorgeous
grew
the
surroundings
his
unguided
steps
wandered
as
it
seemed
of
their
own
accord
into
wide
streets
paved
entirely
with
mosaics
and
lined
on
both
sides
with
lofty
picturesque
and
buildings
he
crossed
and
recrossed
broad
avenues
shaded
by
tall
feathery
palms
and
masses
of
graceful
flowering
foliage
he
passed
rows
upon
rows
of
brilliant
shops
whose
frontages
glittered
with
the
most
costly
and
beautiful
wares
of
every
description
and
as
he
strolled
about
aimlessly
uncertain
whither
to
go
he
was
constantly
jostled
by
the
pressing
throngs
of
people
that
crowded
the
thoroughfares
all
more
or
less
apparently
bent
on
pleasure
to
judge
from
their
animated
countenances
and
frequent
bursts
of
gay
laughter
the
men
were
for
the
most
part
arrayed
like
himself
though
here
and
there
he
met
some
few
whose
garments
were
of
soft
silk
instead
of
linen
who
wore
gold
belts
in
place
of
silver
and
who
carried
their
daggers
in
sheaths
that
were
literally
encrusted
all
over
with
flashing
jewels
as
he
advanced
more
into
the
city
centre
the
crowds
increased
so
much
so
that
the
noise
of
traffic
and
clatter
of
tongues
became
quite
deafening
to
his
ears
richly
ornamented
chariots
drawn
by
spirited
horses
and
driven
by
personages
whose
attire
seemed
to
be
a
positive
blaze
of
gold
and
gems
rolled
past
in
a
continuous
procession
carrying
their
lovely
luscious
merchandise
in
huge
gilded
baskets
stood
at
almost
every
corner
fair
as
flowers
bore
aloft
in
their
gracefully
upraised
arms
wide
wicker
trays
overflowing
with
odorous
blossoms
tied
into
clusters
and
wreaths
and
there
were
countless
numbers
of
curious
little
open
square
carts
to
which
mules
wearing
collars
of
bells
were
harnessed
the
of
their
constant
passage
through
the
throng
making
incessant
merry
music
these
vehicles
bore
the
names
of
traders
purveyors
in
wine
and
dealers
in
all
sorts
of
provisions
but
with
the
exception
of
such
necessary
business
caterers
the
streets
were
full
of
elegant
loungers
of
both
sexes
who
seemed
to
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
but
amuse
themselves
the
women
were
especially
noticeable
for
their
lazy
grace
of
manner
they
glided
to
and
fro
with
an
indolent
floating
ease
that
was
indescribably
bewitching
the
more
so
as
many
of
them
were
endowed
with
exquisite
beauty
of
form
and
feature
beauty
greatly
enhanced
by
the
artistic
simplicity
of
their
costume
this
was
composed
of
a
straight
clinging
gown
slightly
gathered
at
the
throat
and
bound
about
the
waist
with
a
twisted
girdle
of
silver
gold
and
in
some
cases
jewels
their
arms
like
those
of
the
men
were
bare
and
their
small
delicate
feet
were
protected
by
sandals
fastened
with
crossed
bands
of
ribbon
coquettishly
knotted
the
arrangement
of
their
hair
was
evidently
a
matter
of
personal
taste
and
not
the
slavish
copying
of
any
set
fashion
some
allowed
it
to
hang
in
loosely
flowing
abundance
over
their
shoulders
others
had
it
closely
braided
or
coiled
carelessly
in
a
thick
soft
mass
at
the
top
of
the
head
but
all
without
exception
wore
white
veils
veils
long
transparent
and
filmy
as
gossamer
which
they
flung
back
or
draped
about
them
at
their
pleasure
and
presently
after
watching
several
of
these
fairy
creatures
pass
by
and
listening
to
their
low
laughter
and
dulcet
speech
a
sudden
memory
leaped
into
alwyn
confused
brain
an
old
old
memory
that
seemed
to
have
lain
hidden
among
his
thoughts
for
centuries
the
memory
of
a
story
called
lamia
told
in
verse
as
delicious
as
music
aptly
played
who
wrote
the
story
he
could
not
tell
but
he
recollected
that
it
was
about
a
snake
in
the
guise
of
a
beautiful
woman
and
these
women
in
this
strange
city
looked
as
if
they
also
had
a
origin
there
was
something
so
soft
and
lithe
and
undulating
about
their
movements
and
gestures
weary
of
walking
distracted
by
the
clamor
and
feeling
lost
among
the
crowd
he
at
last
perceived
a
wide
and
splendid
square
surrounded
wild
stately
houses
and
having
in
its
centre
a
huge
white
granite
obelisk
which
towered
like
a
pillar
of
snow
against
the
dense
blue
of
the
sky
below
it
a
massively
sculptured
lion
also
of
white
granite
lay
couchant
holding
a
shield
between
its
paws
and
on
either
side
two
fine
fountains
were
in
full
play
the
delicate
spiral
columns
of
water
being
dashed
up
beyond
the
extreme
point
of
the
obelisk
so
that
its
stone
face
was
wet
and
glistening
with
the
tossing
rainbow
shower
here
he
turned
aside
out
of
the
main
thoroughfare
there
were
tall
shady
trees
all
about
and
fantastically
carved
benches
underneath
them
he
determined
to
sit
down
and
rest
and
steadily
think
out
his
involved
and
peculiar
condition
of
mind
as
he
passed
the
sculptured
lion
he
saw
certain
words
engraved
on
the
shield
it
held
they
were
through
the
lion
and
the
serpent
shall
flourish
there
was
no
disorder
in
his
intelligence
concerning
this
sentence
he
was
able
to
read
it
clearly
and
comprehensively
and
yet
what
was
the
language
in
which
it
was
written
and
how
did
he
come
to
know
it
so
thoroughly
with
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
groan
he
sank
listlessly
on
a
seat
and
burying
his
head
in
his
hands
to
shut
out
all
the
strange
sights
which
so
direfully
perplexed
his
reason
he
began
to
subject
himself
to
a
patient
serious
in
the
first
place
who
was
he
part
of
the
required
answer
came
readily
theos
theos
what
his
brain
refused
to
clear
up
this
point
it
repeated
theos
theos
over
and
over
again
but
no
more
shuddering
with
a
vague
dread
he
asked
himself
the
next
question
from
whence
had
he
come
the
reply
was
direct
and
decisive
from
ardath
but
what
was
ardath
it
was
neither
a
country
nor
a
city
it
was
a
waste
field
where
he
had
seen
ah
whom
had
he
seen
he
struggled
furiously
with
himself
for
some
response
to
this
none
came
total
dumb
blankness
was
the
sole
result
of
the
inward
rack
to
which
he
subjected
his
thoughts
and
where
had
he
been
before
he
ever
saw
ardath
had
he
no
recollection
of
any
other
place
any
other
surroundings
absolutely
none
torture
his
wits
as
he
would
absolutely
none
this
was
frightful
incredible
surely
surely
he
mused
piteously
there
must
have
been
something
in
his
life
before
the
name
of
ardath
had
swamped
his
intelligence
he
lifted
his
head
his
face
had
grown
ashen
gray
and
rigid
in
the
deep
extremity
of
his
speechless
trouble
and
terror
there
was
a
sick
faintness
at
his
heart
and
rising
he
moved
unsteadily
to
one
of
the
great
fountains
and
there
dipping
his
hands
in
the
spray
he
dashed
some
drops
on
his
brow
and
eyes
then
making
a
cup
of
the
hollowed
palms
he
drank
thirstily
several
draughts
of
the
cool
sweet
water
it
seemed
to
allay
the
fever
in
his
blood
he
looked
around
him
with
a
wild
vague
smile
of
course
he
was
in
why
was
he
so
distressed
about
it
it
was
a
pleasant
city
there
was
much
to
see
and
also
much
to
learn
at
that
instant
a
loud
blast
of
trumpets
split
the
air
followed
by
a
of
distant
acclamation
surging
up
from
thousands
of
throats
crowds
of
men
and
women
suddenly
flocked
into
the
square
across
it
and
out
of
it
again
all
pressing
impetuously
in
one
direction
and
urged
forward
by
the
general
rush
as
well
as
by
a
corresponding
impulse
within
himself
he
flung
all
meditation
to
the
winds
and
plunged
recklessly
into
the
shouting
onsweeping
throng
he
was
borne
swiftly
with
it
down
a
broad
avenue
lined
with
grand
old
trees
and
decked
with
flying
flags
and
streamers
to
the
margin
of
a
noble
river
as
still
as
liquid
amber
in
the
wide
sheen
and
heat
of
the
noonday
sun
a
splendid
marble
embankment
adorned
with
colossal
statues
girdled
it
on
both
sides
and
here
under
silken
awnings
of
every
color
pattern
and
design
an
enormous
multitude
was
assembled
its
white
attired
closely
packed
ranks
stretching
far
away
into
the
blue
distance
on
either
hand
all
the
attention
of
this
vast
concourse
appeared
to
be
centered
on
the
slow
approach
of
a
strange
gilded
vessel
that
with
great
curved
prow
and
scarlet
sails
flapping
idly
in
the
faint
breeze
was
gliding
leisurely
yet
majestically
over
the
azure
blaze
of
the
smooth
water
huge
oars
like
golden
fins
projected
from
her
sides
and
dipped
lazily
every
now
and
then
apparently
wielded
by
the
hands
of
invisible
rowers
whose
united
voices
supplied
the
lack
of
the
needful
wind
and
as
he
caught
sight
of
this
cumbrously
quaint
galley
theos
moved
by
sudden
interest
elbowed
his
way
resolutely
though
the
dense
crowd
till
he
gained
the
edge
of
the
embankment
where
leaning
against
the
marble
balustrade
he
watched
with
a
curious
fascination
its
gradual
advance
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
brighter
and
brighter
glowed
the
vivid
scarlet
of
its
sails
a
solemn
sound
of
stringed
music
rippled
enchantingly
over
the
glassy
river
mingling
itself
with
the
wild
shouting
of
the
populace
shouting
that
seemed
to
rend
the
hollow
vault
of
heaven
nearer
nearer
and
now
the
vessel
slid
round
and
curtsied
forward
its
propelling
fins
moved
more
rapidly
another
graceful
sweep
and
lo
it
fronted
the
surging
throng
like
a
glittering
fantastic
apparition
drawn
out
of
dreamland
theos
stared
at
it
dazzled
and
stricken
with
a
breathless
wonder
was
ever
a
ship
like
this
he
thought
a
ship
that
sparkled
all
over
as
though
it
were
carven
out
of
one
great
burning
jewel
golden
hangings
falling
in
rich
loose
folds
draped
it
gorgeously
from
stem
to
stern
gold
cordage
looped
the
sails
on
the
deck
a
band
of
young
gals
clad
in
white
and
crowned
with
flowers
knelt
playing
softly
on
quaintly
shaped
instruments
and
a
cluster
of
tiny
boys
fair
as
young
cupids
were
grouped
in
pretty
reposeful
attitudes
along
the
edge
of
the
gilded
prow
holding
garlands
of
red
and
yellow
blossoms
which
trailed
down
to
the
surface
of
the
water
beneath
as
a
man
may
note
a
sudden
brilliant
glare
of
sunshine
flashing
on
the
wall
of
his
so
theos
at
first
viewed
this
floating
pageant
in
confused
uncomprehending
bewilderment
when
all
at
once
his
stupefied
senses
were
roused
to
hot
life
and
pulsing
action
with
a
smothered
cry
of
ecstasy
he
fixed
his
straining
eager
gaze
on
one
supreme
fair
figure
the
central
glory
of
the
marvellous
picture
a
woman
or
a
goddess
a
rainbow
flame
in
mortal
shape
a
spirit
of
earth
air
fire
water
or
a
thought
of
beauty
embodied
into
human
sweetness
and
made
perfect
clothed
in
gold
attire
and
girdled
with
gems
she
stood
leaning
indolently
against
the
middle
mast
of
the
vessel
her
great
sombre
dusky
eyes
resting
drowsily
on
the
swarming
masses
of
people
whose
frenzied
roar
of
rapture
and
admiration
sounded
like
the
breaking
of
billows
presently
with
a
slow
solemn
smile
on
her
haughtily
curved
lips
she
extended
one
hand
and
arm
and
glittering
with
jewels
and
made
an
imperious
gesture
to
command
silence
instantly
a
profound
hush
ensued
lifting
a
long
slender
white
wand
at
the
end
of
which
could
be
plainly
seen
the
gleaming
silver
head
of
a
serpent
she
described
three
circles
in
the
air
with
a
perfectly
even
majestic
motion
and
as
she
did
this
her
marvellous
eyes
turned
toward
theos
and
dwelt
steadily
upon
him
he
met
her
gaze
fully
absorbing
into
his
inmost
soul
the
mesmeric
spell
of
her
matchless
loveliness
he
saw
without
actually
realizing
the
circumstance
that
the
whole
vast
multitude
around
him
had
fallen
prostrate
in
an
attitude
of
worship
and
still
he
stood
erect
drinking
in
the
warmth
of
those
dark
witching
sleepy
orbs
that
flashed
at
him
and
then
the
ship
began
to
sway
gently
and
move
onwards
she
that
wondrous
was
vanishing
vanishing
she
and
her
kneeling
maidens
and
music
and
flowers
vanishing
where
with
a
start
he
sprang
from
his
post
of
observation
he
felt
he
must
go
after
her
at
all
risks
he
must
find
out
her
place
of
abode
her
rank
her
title
her
name
all
at
once
he
was
roughly
seized
by
a
dozen
or
more
of
hands
loud
angry
voices
shouted
on
all
a
traitor
a
traitor
an
infidel
a
spy
a
malcontent
into
the
river
with
him
he
refuses
worship
he
denies
the
gods
bear
him
to
the
tribunal
and
in
a
trice
of
time
he
was
completely
surrounded
and
hemmed
in
by
an
exasperated
gesticulating
crowd
whose
ominous
looks
and
indignant
mutterings
were
plainly
significant
of
prompt
hostility
with
a
few
agile
movements
he
succeeded
in
wrenching
himself
free
from
the
grasp
of
his
assailants
and
standing
among
them
like
a
stag
at
bay
he
cried
what
have
i
done
how
have
i
offended
speak
or
is
it
the
fashion
of
to
condemn
a
man
unheard
no
one
answered
this
appeal
the
very
directness
of
it
seemed
to
increase
the
irritation
of
the
mob
that
pressing
closer
and
closer
began
to
jostle
and
hustle
him
in
a
threatening
manner
that
boded
ill
for
his
safety
he
was
again
taken
prisoner
and
struggling
in
the
grasp
of
his
captors
he
was
preparing
to
fight
for
his
life
as
best
he
could
against
the
general
fury
when
the
sound
of
musical
strings
swept
carelessly
upwards
in
the
ascending
scale
struck
sweetly
through
the
clamor
a
youth
arrayed
in
crimson
and
carrying
a
small
golden
harp
marched
sedately
between
the
serried
ranks
that
parted
right
and
left
at
his
approach
thus
clearing
the
way
for
another
personage
who
followed
him
a
graceful
personage
in
glistening
white
attire
who
wore
a
on
his
dark
abundant
locks
and
whom
the
populace
forgetting
for
a
moment
the
cause
of
their
recent
disturbance
greeted
with
a
ringing
and
ecstatic
shout
of
hail
again
and
again
this
cry
was
uplifted
till
far
away
on
the
extreme
outskirts
of
the
throng
the
joyous
echo
of
it
was
repeated
faintly
yet
distinctly
hail
hail
chapter
xii
the
thus
enthusiastically
welcomed
bowed
right
and
left
with
a
condescending
air
in
response
to
the
general
acclamation
and
advancing
to
the
spot
where
theos
stood
an
enforced
prisoner
in
the
close
grip
of
three
or
four
citizens
he
said
what
turbulence
is
here
by
my
faith
when
i
heard
the
noise
of
quarrelsome
contention
jarring
the
sweetness
of
this
nectarous
noon
methought
i
was
no
longer
in
but
rather
in
some
western
city
of
barbarians
where
music
is
but
an
unvalued
name
and
he
smiled
a
dazzling
smile
half
petulant
a
smile
of
supreme
as
of
one
who
knew
his
own
resistless
power
to
charm
away
all
discord
several
voices
answered
him
in
clamorous
unison
a
traitor
a
profane
rebel
an
unbeliever
a
most
insolent
knave
he
refused
homage
to
the
high
priestess
a
renegade
from
the
faith
now
by
the
sacred
veil
cried
impatiently
think
ye
i
can
distinguish
your
jargon
when
like
ignorant
boors
ye
talk
all
at
once
tearing
my
ears
to
shreds
with
such
unmelodious
whom
have
ye
seized
thus
roughly
let
him
stand
forth
at
this
command
the
men
who
held
theos
relaxed
their
grasp
and
he
breathless
and
burning
with
indignation
at
the
treatment
he
had
received
shook
himself
quickly
free
of
all
restraint
and
sprang
forward
confronting
his
rescuer
there
was
a
brief
pause
during
which
the
two
surveyed
each
other
with
looks
of
mutual
amazement
what
mysterious
indication
of
affinity
did
they
read
in
one
another
faces
why
did
they
stand
motionless
and
dumb
for
a
while
eying
each
other
personal
appearance
and
bearing
undoubtedly
a
curious
resemblance
existed
between
them
yet
it
was
a
resemblance
that
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
actual
figure
mien
or
countenance
it
was
that
peculiar
and
often
undefinable
similarity
of
expression
which
when
noticed
between
two
brothers
who
are
otherwise
totally
unlike
instantly
proclaims
their
relationship
theos
realized
his
own
superior
height
and
superior
muscular
development
but
what
were
these
physical
advantages
compared
to
the
classic
perfection
of
beauty
beauty
combining
the
delicate
with
the
vigorous
such
as
is
shadowed
forth
in
the
of
the
god
apollo
his
features
faultlessly
regular
were
redeemed
from
all
effeminacy
by
the
ennobling
impress
of
high
thought
and
inward
inspiration
his
eyes
were
dark
with
a
brilliant
of
in
them
that
at
times
flashed
out
like
the
soft
glitter
of
in
the
dense
purple
of
an
august
heaven
his
complexion
was
flushed
warmly
with
the
glow
of
health
and
he
had
broad
bold
intellectual
brows
over
which
the
rich
hair
clustered
in
luxuriant
waves
hair
that
was
almost
black
with
here
and
there
a
curious
fleck
of
reddish
gold
brightening
its
curling
masses
as
though
a
stray
sunbeam
or
two
had
been
caught
and
entangled
therein
he
was
arrayed
in
a
costume
of
the
finest
silk
his
armlets
belt
and
daggersheath
were
all
of
jewels
and
the
general
brilliancy
of
his
attire
was
furthermore
increased
by
a
finely
worked
flexible
collar
of
gold
set
with
diamonds
the
first
exchange
of
wondering
glances
over
he
viewed
theos
with
a
critical
half
supercilious
air
what
art
thou
he
demanded
what
is
thy
calling
theos
hesitated
then
spoke
out
boldly
and
unthinkingly
i
am
a
poet
he
said
a
murmur
of
irrepressible
laughter
and
derision
ran
through
the
listening
crowd
lip
curled
haughtily
a
poet
and
his
fingers
played
idly
with
the
dagger
at
his
belt
nay
not
so
there
is
but
one
poet
in
and
i
am
he
theos
looked
at
him
steadily
a
subtle
sympathy
attracted
him
toward
this
charming
boaster
involuntarily
he
smiled
and
bent
his
head
courteously
i
do
not
seek
to
figure
as
your
rival
he
began
rival
echoed
i
have
no
rivals
a
burst
of
applause
from
those
nearest
to
them
in
the
throng
declared
the
popular
approval
of
this
assertion
and
the
boy
bearing
the
harp
who
had
loitered
to
listen
to
the
conversation
swept
the
strings
of
his
instrument
with
a
triumphant
force
and
fervor
that
showed
how
thoroughly
his
feelings
were
in
harmony
with
the
expression
of
his
master
sentiments
conquered
with
an
effort
his
momentary
irritation
and
resumed
coldly
from
whence
do
you
come
fair
sir
we
should
know
your
name
poets
are
not
so
common
this
with
an
accent
of
irony
taken
aback
by
the
question
theos
stood
irresolute
and
uncertain
what
to
say
for
he
was
afflicted
with
a
strange
and
terrible
malady
such
as
he
dimly
remembered
having
heard
of
but
never
expected
to
suffer
from
a
malady
in
which
his
memory
had
become
almost
a
blank
as
regarded
the
past
events
of
his
life
though
every
now
and
then
shadowy
images
of
things
flitted
across
his
brain
like
the
transient
reflections
of
clouds
on
still
translucent
water
presently
in
the
midst
of
his
painful
indecision
an
answer
suggested
itself
like
a
whispered
hint
from
some
invisible
prompter
poets
like
are
no
doubt
as
rare
as
nightingales
in
snow
he
said
with
a
soft
deference
and
an
increasing
sense
of
tenderness
for
his
haughty
handsome
interlocutor
as
for
me
i
am
a
singer
of
sad
songs
that
are
not
worth
the
hearing
my
name
is
theos
i
come
from
far
beyond
the
seas
and
am
a
stranger
in
therefore
if
i
have
erred
in
aught
i
must
be
blamed
for
ignorance
not
malice
as
he
spoke
regarded
him
intently
theos
met
his
gaze
frankly
and
unflinchingly
surely
there
was
some
singular
power
of
attraction
between
the
two
for
as
their
flashing
eyes
again
dwelt
earnestly
on
one
another
they
both
smiled
and
advancing
proffered
his
hand
theos
at
once
accepted
it
a
curious
sensation
of
pleasure
tingling
through
his
frame
as
he
pressed
those
slender
blown
fingers
in
his
own
cordial
clasp
a
stranger
in
and
from
beyond
the
seas
then
by
my
life
and
honor
i
insure
thy
safety
and
bid
thee
welcome
a
singer
of
sad
songs
sad
or
merry
that
thou
are
a
singer
at
all
makes
thee
the
guest
of
the
king
laureate
a
look
of
conscious
vanity
illumined
his
face
as
he
thus
announced
with
proud
emphasis
his
own
title
and
claim
to
distinction
the
brotherhood
of
poets
he
continued
laughingly
is
a
mystic
and
doubtful
tie
that
hath
oft
been
questioned
but
provided
they
do
not
like
wolves
fight
each
other
out
of
the
arena
there
should
be
joy
in
the
relationship
here
turning
full
upon
the
crowd
he
lifted
his
rich
melodious
voice
to
higher
and
more
ringing
tones
it
is
like
you
o
hasty
and
misjudging
kyrisians
that
finding
a
harmless
wanderer
from
far
off
lands
present
at
the
pageant
of
the
midsummer
benediction
ye
should
pounce
upon
him
even
as
kites
on
a
straying
and
maul
him
with
your
ruthless
talons
has
he
broken
the
law
of
worship
ye
have
broken
the
law
of
hospitality
has
he
failed
to
kneel
to
the
passing
ship
of
the
sun
so
have
ye
failed
to
handle
him
with
due
courtesy
what
report
shall
he
bear
hence
of
your
gentleness
and
culture
to
those
dim
and
unjoyous
shores
beyond
the
gray
green
wall
of
where
the
very
name
of
serves
as
a
symbol
for
all
that
is
great
and
wise
and
wondrous
in
the
whole
round
circle
of
the
world
moreover
ye
know
full
well
that
foreigners
and
sojourners
in
the
city
are
exempt
from
worship
and
the
king
command
is
that
all
such
should
be
well
and
nobly
entertained
to
the
end
that
when
they
depart
they
may
carry
with
them
a
full
store
of
pleasant
memories
hence
scatterbrains
to
your
homes
no
festival
can
ye
enjoy
without
a
gust
of
contention
ye
are
instruments
all
whose
jarring
strings
even
i
crowned
minstrel
of
the
king
can
scarce
keep
one
day
in
happy
tune
look
you
now
this
stranger
is
my
guest
is
there
a
man
in
who
will
treat
as
an
enemy
one
whom
calls
friend
a
storm
of
applause
followed
this
little
extempore
speech
applause
accompanied
by
an
odorous
rain
of
flowers
there
were
many
women
in
the
crowd
and
these
had
pressed
eagerly
forward
to
catch
every
word
that
dropped
from
the
mellifluous
lips
now
moved
by
one
common
impulse
they
hastily
snatched
off
their
posies
and
garlands
and
flung
them
in
lavish
abundance
at
his
feet
some
of
the
blossoms
chancing
to
fall
on
theos
and
cling
to
his
garments
he
quickly
shook
them
off
and
gathering
them
together
presented
them
to
the
personage
for
whom
they
were
intended
he
however
gayly
rejected
them
moving
his
small
sandalled
foot
playfully
among
the
thick
wealth
of
red
and
white
roses
that
lay
waiting
to
be
crushed
beneath
his
tread
keep
thy
share
he
said
with
an
amused
flash
of
his
glorious
eyes
such
offerings
are
my
daily
lot
i
can
spare
thee
one
handful
from
the
overflowing
harvest
of
my
song
it
was
impossible
to
be
offended
with
such
charming
the
naive
conceit
of
the
man
was
as
harmless
as
the
delight
of
a
fair
girl
who
has
made
her
first
conquest
and
theos
smiling
kept
the
flowers
by
this
time
the
surrounding
throng
had
broken
up
into
little
knots
and
groups
all
on
the
part
of
the
populace
had
completely
vanished
and
large
numbers
were
now
leaving
the
embankment
and
dispersing
in
different
directions
to
their
several
homes
all
those
who
had
been
within
hearing
distance
of
voice
appeared
highly
elated
as
though
they
had
enjoyed
some
special
privilege
and
pleasure
to
be
reproved
by
the
laureate
was
evidently
considered
better
than
being
praised
by
any
one
else
many
persons
pressed
up
to
theos
and
shaking
hands
with
him
offered
their
eager
excuses
and
apologies
for
the
misunderstanding
that
had
lately
taken
place
explaining
with
much
animation
both
of
look
and
gesture
that
the
fact
of
his
wearing
the
same
style
of
dress
as
themselves
had
induced
them
to
take
it
for
granted
that
he
must
be
one
of
their
and
therefore
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
realm
theos
was
just
beginning
to
feel
somewhat
embarrassed
by
the
excessive
politeness
and
cordiality
of
his
recent
antagonists
when
again
interposing
cut
all
explanations
short
come
come
cease
this
useless
prating
he
said
imperatively
yet
in
everything
ye
showed
your
dullard
ignorance
and
lack
of
discernment
for
concerning
the
matter
of
attire
are
not
the
fashions
of
copied
more
or
less
badly
in
every
quarter
of
the
habitable
globe
even
as
our
language
and
literature
form
the
chief
study
and
delight
of
all
scholars
and
educated
gentlemen
a
truce
to
your
discussions
let
us
get
hence
and
home
here
he
turned
to
theos
with
a
graceful
salutation
you
my
good
friend
will
doubtless
be
glad
to
rest
and
recover
from
my
countrymen
ungentle
treatment
of
your
person
thus
saying
he
made
a
slight
commanding
sign
the
clustering
people
drew
back
on
either
side
and
he
taking
theos
by
the
arm
passed
through
their
ranks
talking
laughing
and
nodding
graciously
here
and
there
as
he
went
with
the
ease
of
an
affable
monarch
who
occasionally
bows
to
some
of
his
poorest
subjects
as
he
trod
over
the
flowers
that
lay
heaped
about
his
path
several
girls
rushed
impetuously
forward
struggling
with
each
other
for
possession
of
those
particularly
favored
blossoms
that
had
received
the
pressure
of
his
foot
and
kissing
them
they
tied
them
in
little
knots
and
pinned
them
proudly
on
the
bosoms
of
their
white
gowns
one
or
two
more
daring
stretched
out
their
hands
to
touch
the
golden
frame
of
the
harp
as
it
was
carried
past
them
by
the
youth
in
crimson
a
pretty
fellow
enough
who
looked
extremely
haughty
and
almost
indignant
at
this
effrontery
on
the
part
of
the
fair
but
he
made
no
remonstrance
and
merely
held
his
head
a
little
higher
and
walked
with
a
more
consequential
air
as
he
followed
his
master
at
a
respectful
distance
another
long
ecstatic
shout
of
hail
arose
on
all
sides
rippling
away
away
down
as
it
seemed
to
the
very
furthest
edge
of
echoing
resonance
and
then
the
remainder
of
the
crowd
quickly
scattered
right
and
left
leaving
the
spacious
embankment
almost
deserted
save
for
the
presence
of
several
individuals
who
were
commencing
the
work
of
taking
down
and
rolling
up
the
silken
awnings
accompanying
their
labors
by
a
sort
of
monotonous
chant
that
mingling
with
the
slow
gliding
plash
of
the
river
sounded
as
weird
and
mournful
as
the
sough
of
the
wind
through
leafless
trees
meanwhile
theos
in
the
company
of
his
new
friend
began
to
express
his
thanks
for
the
timely
rescue
he
had
received
but
waived
all
such
acknowledgments
aside
nay
i
have
only
served
thee
as
a
crowned
laureate
should
ever
serve
a
lesser
minstrel
he
said
with
that
indescribably
delicious
air
of
which
was
so
whimsical
and
yet
so
winning
and
i
tell
thee
in
all
good
faith
that
for
a
newly
arrived
visitor
in
thy
first
venture
was
a
reckless
one
to
omit
to
kneel
in
the
presence
of
the
high
priestess
during
her
benediction
was
a
violation
of
our
customs
and
ceremonies
dangerous
to
life
and
limb
a
religiously
excited
mob
is
merciless
and
if
i
had
not
chanced
upon
the
scene
of
action
i
should
have
been
no
longer
the
man
i
am
smiled
theos
looking
down
on
his
companion
light
lithe
elegant
form
as
it
moved
gracefully
by
his
side
but
that
i
failed
in
homage
to
the
high
priestess
was
a
most
unintentional
lack
of
wit
on
my
part
for
if
that
was
the
high
priestess
that
dazzling
wonder
of
beauty
who
lately
passed
in
a
glittering
ship
on
her
triumphant
way
down
the
river
like
a
priceless
pearl
in
a
cup
of
gold
aye
aye
and
dark
brows
contracted
in
a
slight
frown
not
so
many
fine
words
i
pray
thee
thou
couldst
not
well
mistake
her
there
is
only
one
lysia
lysia
murmured
theos
dreamily
and
the
musical
name
slid
off
his
lips
with
a
soft
sibilant
sound
lysia
and
i
forgot
to
kneel
to
that
enchanting
that
adorable
being
oh
unwise
benighted
fool
where
were
my
thoughts
next
time
i
see
her
i
will
atone
no
matter
what
creed
she
represents
i
will
kiss
the
dust
at
her
feet
and
so
make
reparation
for
my
sin
glanced
at
him
with
a
somewhat
dubious
expression
what
art
thou
already
persuaded
he
queried
lightly
and
wilt
thou
also
be
one
of
us
well
thou
wilt
need
to
kiss
the
dust
in
very
truth
if
thou
servest
lysia
no
will
suit
where
she
the
untouched
and
immaculate
is
concerned
and
here
there
was
a
faint
inflection
of
mingled
mockery
and
sadness
in
his
tone
to
love
her
is
for
many
men
an
absolute
necessity
but
the
virgin
priestess
of
the
sun
and
the
serpent
receives
love
as
statues
may
receive
it
moving
all
others
to
frenzy
she
is
herself
unmoved
theos
listened
scarcely
hearing
he
was
studying
every
line
in
face
and
figure
with
fixed
and
wistful
attention
almost
unconsciously
he
pressed
the
arm
he
held
and
looked
up
at
him
with
a
i
fancy
we
shall
like
each
other
he
said
thou
art
a
western
singing
and
i
a
nested
nightingale
amid
the
roses
of
the
east
our
ways
of
making
melody
are
different
we
shall
not
quarrel
quarrel
echoed
theos
amazedly
nay
i
might
quarrel
with
my
nearest
and
dearest
but
never
with
thee
for
i
know
thee
for
a
very
prince
of
poets
and
would
as
soon
profane
the
sanctity
of
the
muse
herself
as
violate
thy
proffered
friendship
why
so
returned
his
brilliant
eyes
flashing
with
undisguised
pleasure
an
thou
thinkest
thus
of
me
we
shall
be
firm
and
fast
companions
thou
hast
spoken
well
and
not
without
good
instruction
i
perceive
my
fame
hath
reached
thee
in
thine
own
lands
where
music
is
as
rare
as
sunshine
right
glad
am
i
that
chance
has
thrown
us
together
for
now
thou
wilt
be
better
able
to
judge
of
my
unrivalled
in
sweet
thou
must
abide
with
me
for
all
the
days
of
thy
sojourn
here
art
willing
willing
aye
more
than
willing
exclaimed
theos
enthusiastically
but
if
i
burden
burden
and
laughed
talk
not
of
burdens
to
me
i
who
have
feasted
kings
and
made
light
of
their
entertaining
here
he
added
as
he
led
the
way
through
a
broad
alley
lined
with
magnificent
palms
here
is
the
entrance
to
my
poor
dwelling
and
a
sparkling
mischievous
smile
brightened
his
there
is
room
enough
in
it
methinks
to
hold
thee
even
if
thou
hadst
brought
a
retinue
of
slaves
he
pointed
before
him
as
he
spoke
and
theos
stood
for
a
moment
and
overcome
with
astonishment
at
the
size
and
splendor
of
the
palace
whose
gates
they
were
just
approaching
it
was
a
building
of
the
purest
white
marble
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
long
fluted
colonnades
and
fronted
by
spacious
court
paved
with
mosaics
where
eight
fountains
dashed
up
to
the
hot
blue
sky
incessant
showers
of
refreshing
spray
into
this
court
and
across
it
led
his
wondering
guest
ascending
a
wide
flight
of
steps
they
entered
a
vast
open
hall
where
the
light
poured
in
through
and
pale
blue
glass
that
gave
a
strange
yet
lovely
effect
of
mingled
sunset
and
moonlight
to
the
scene
here
reclining
about
on
cushions
of
silk
and
velvet
were
several
beautiful
girls
in
various
attitudes
of
indolence
and
ease
one
laughing
houri
was
amusing
herself
with
a
tame
bird
which
flew
to
and
from
her
uplifted
finger
another
in
a
posture
played
with
much
active
and
graceful
dexterity
some
were
working
at
gold
and
silver
embroidery
others
clustered
in
a
semicircle
round
a
large
osier
basket
filled
with
myrtle
were
busy
weaving
garlands
of
the
fragrant
leaves
and
one
maiden
seemingly
younger
than
the
rest
and
of
lighter
and
more
delicate
complexion
leaned
somewhat
pensively
against
an
harp
as
though
she
were
considering
what
sad
or
suggestive
chords
she
should
next
awaken
from
its
responsive
strings
as
and
theos
appeared
these
nymphs
all
rose
from
their
different
occupations
and
amusements
and
stood
with
bent
heads
and
folded
hands
in
statuesque
silence
and
humility
these
are
my
human
rosebuds
said
softly
and
gayly
as
holding
the
dazzled
theos
by
the
arm
he
escorted
him
past
these
radiant
and
exquisite
forms
they
bloom
and
fade
and
die
like
the
flowers
thrown
by
the
populace
proud
and
happy
to
feel
that
their
perishable
loveliness
has
even
for
a
brief
while
been
made
more
lasting
by
contact
with
my
deathless
ah
niphrata
and
he
paused
at
the
side
of
the
girl
standing
by
the
harp
hast
thou
sung
many
of
my
songs
or
is
thy
voice
too
weak
for
such
impassioned
cadence
thou
art
pale
i
miss
thy
soft
blush
and
dimpling
smile
what
ails
thee
my
oriole
nothing
my
lord
answered
niphrata
in
a
low
tone
raising
a
pair
of
lovely
dusky
violet
eyes
fringed
with
long
black
lashes
nothing
save
that
my
heart
is
always
sad
in
thine
absence
smiled
well
pleased
let
it
be
sad
no
longer
then
he
said
caressing
her
cheek
with
his
hand
and
theos
saw
a
wave
of
rich
color
mounting
swiftly
to
her
fair
brows
at
his
touch
as
though
she
were
a
white
poppy
warming
to
crimson
in
the
ardent
heat
of
the
sun
i
love
to
see
thee
merry
mirth
suits
a
young
and
beauteous
face
like
thine
look
you
sweet
i
bring
with
me
here
a
stranger
from
lands
one
to
whom
name
is
as
a
star
in
the
desert
i
must
needs
have
thy
voice
in
all
its
full
lusciousness
of
tune
to
warble
for
his
pleasure
those
ditties
of
mine
which
thou
hast
learned
to
render
with
such
matchless
tenderness
thanks
gisenya
this
as
another
maiden
advanced
and
gently
removing
the
he
wore
placed
one
just
freshly
woven
on
his
clustering
curls
then
turning
to
theos
he
inquired
wilt
thou
also
wear
a
my
friend
niphrata
or
gisenya
will
crown
thee
i
am
not
worthy
answered
theos
bending
his
head
in
low
salutation
to
the
two
lovely
girls
who
stood
eying
him
with
a
certain
wistful
wonder
one
spray
from
discarded
wreath
will
best
suffice
me
broke
into
a
laugh
of
absolute
delight
i
swear
thou
speakest
well
and
like
a
true
man
he
said
joyously
unfamous
as
thou
art
thou
deservest
honor
for
the
frank
confession
of
thy
lack
of
merit
believe
me
there
are
some
boastful
rhymers
in
who
would
benefit
much
by
a
share
of
thy
becoming
modesty
give
him
his
wish
gisenya
and
gisenya
obediently
detaching
a
sprig
of
myrtle
from
the
wreath
had
worn
all
day
handed
it
to
theos
with
a
graceful
obeisance
for
who
knows
but
the
leaves
may
contain
a
certain
witchery
we
wot
not
of
that
shall
endow
him
with
a
touch
of
the
divine
inspiration
at
that
moment
a
curious
figure
came
shuffling
across
the
splendid
hall
that
of
a
little
old
man
somewhat
shabbily
attired
upon
whose
wrinkled
countenance
there
seemed
to
be
a
fixed
malign
smile
like
the
smile
of
a
mocking
greek
mask
he
had
small
bright
beady
black
eyes
placed
very
near
the
bridge
of
his
large
hooked
nose
his
thin
wispy
gray
locks
streamed
scantily
over
his
bent
shoulders
and
he
carried
a
tall
staff
to
support
his
awkward
steps
a
staff
with
which
he
made
a
most
disagreeable
tapping
noise
on
the
marble
pavement
as
he
came
along
ah
sir
he
exclaimed
in
a
harsh
squeaky
voice
as
he
perceived
back
again
from
your
in
the
city
is
there
any
poor
soul
left
in
whose
ears
have
not
been
deafened
by
the
of
the
name
of
if
there
is
at
him
at
him
my
dainty
warbler
of
tiresome
trills
at
him
and
storm
his
senses
with
a
rhodomontade
of
rhymes
without
reason
at
him
immortal
of
the
immortals
bard
of
bards
stuff
him
with
quatrains
and
sextains
beat
him
with
blank
verse
blank
of
all
meaning
lash
him
with
ballad
and
till
the
tortured
wretch
howling
for
mercy
shall
swear
that
no
poet
save
ever
lived
before
or
will
ever
live
again
on
the
face
of
the
shuddering
and
astonished
earth
and
breathless
with
this
extraordinary
outburst
he
struck
his
staff
loudly
on
the
floor
and
straightway
fell
into
such
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
that
his
whole
lean
body
shook
with
the
paroxysm
laughed
heartily
laughter
in
which
he
was
joined
by
all
the
assembled
maidens
including
the
gentle
niphrata
standing
erect
in
his
glistening
princely
attire
with
one
hand
resting
familiarly
on
theos
arm
and
the
sparkle
of
mirth
lighting
up
his
handsome
features
he
formed
the
greatest
contrast
imaginable
to
the
little
shrunken
old
personage
who
clinging
convulsively
to
his
staff
was
entirely
absorbed
in
his
efforts
to
control
and
overcome
his
sudden
and
unpleasant
attack
of
threatened
suffocation
theos
my
friend
he
said
still
laughing
thou
must
know
the
admirable
zabastes
a
man
of
vast
importance
in
his
own
opinion
have
done
with
thy
wheezing
he
continued
vehemently
thumping
the
struggling
old
gentleman
on
the
back
here
is
another
one
of
the
minstrel
craft
thou
hatest
hast
aught
of
bitterness
in
thy
barbed
tongue
wherewith
to
welcome
him
as
guest
to
mine
abode
thus
adjured
the
old
man
peered
up
at
theos
inquisitively
wiping
away
the
tears
that
coughing
had
brought
into
his
eyes
and
after
a
minute
or
two
began
also
to
laugh
in
a
smothered
chuckling
way
a
laugh
that
resembled
the
croaking
of
frogs
in
a
marshy
pool
another
one
of
the
he
echoed
derisively
aye
aye
like
meets
like
and
fools
consorts
with
fool
the
guest
of
hearken
young
man
and
he
drew
closer
the
malign
grin
widening
on
his
furrowed
face
thou
shalt
learn
enough
trash
here
to
stock
thee
with
for
a
century
thou
shalt
gather
up
such
fragments
of
stupidity
as
shall
provide
thee
with
food
for
all
the
puling
girls
of
a
nation
dost
thou
write
follies
also
thou
shalt
not
write
them
here
thou
shalt
not
even
think
them
for
here
the
great
the
unrivalled
is
sole
lord
of
the
land
of
poesy
poesy
by
all
the
gods
i
would
the
accursed
art
had
never
been
invented
so
might
the
world
have
been
spared
many
nothings
enwoofed
in
obscure
and
distracting
phraseology
thou
a
poet
go
to
make
brick
mend
sandals
dig
entrenchments
fight
for
thy
country
and
leave
the
idle
stringing
of
words
and
the
tinkling
of
rhyme
to
children
like
who
play
with
life
instead
of
living
it
and
with
this
he
hobbled
off
uneasily
grunting
and
grumbling
as
he
went
and
waving
his
staff
magisterially
right
and
left
to
warn
the
smiling
maidens
out
of
his
way
and
once
more
laughter
clear
and
joyous
pealed
through
the
vaulted
vestibule
poor
zabastes
he
said
in
a
tone
of
tolerance
he
has
the
most
caustic
wit
of
any
man
in
he
is
a
positive
marvel
of
perverseness
and
well
worth
the
four
hundred
golden
pieces
i
pay
him
yearly
for
his
task
of
being
my
scribe
and
critic
like
all
of
us
he
must
live
eat
and
wear
decent
clothing
and
that
his
only
literary
skill
lies
in
the
abuse
of
better
men
than
himself
is
his
misfortune
rather
than
his
fault
yes
he
is
my
paid
critic
paid
to
rail
against
me
on
all
occasions
public
or
private
for
the
merriment
of
those
who
care
to
listen
to
the
mutterings
of
his
discontent
and
by
the
sacred
veil
i
can
not
choose
but
laugh
myself
whenever
i
think
of
him
he
deems
his
words
carry
weight
with
the
people
alas
poor
soul
his
scorn
but
adds
to
my
glory
his
derision
to
my
fame
nay
of
a
truth
i
need
him
even
as
the
king
needs
the
court
fool
to
make
mirth
for
me
in
vacant
moments
for
there
is
something
grotesque
in
the
contemplation
of
his
cankered
clownishness
that
sees
nought
in
life
but
the
eating
the
sleeping
the
building
and
the
bargaining
such
men
as
he
can
never
bear
to
know
that
there
are
others
gifted
by
heaven
for
whom
all
common
things
take
radiant
shape
and
meaning
for
whom
the
flowers
reveal
their
fragrant
secrets
for
whom
birds
not
only
sing
but
speak
in
most
melodious
utterance
for
whose
dreaming
eyes
the
very
sunbeams
spin
bright
fantasies
in
more
lasting
than
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
blind
and
unhappy
zabastes
he
is
ignorant
as
a
stone
and
for
him
the
mysteries
of
nature
are
forever
veiled
the
triumphal
of
the
stars
the
brief
bright
rhyme
of
the
flashing
comet
the
canticle
of
the
rose
as
she
bears
her
crimson
heart
to
the
smile
of
the
sun
the
chorus
of
green
leaves
chanting
orisons
to
the
wind
the
never
completed
epic
of
heaven
lofty
solitudes
where
the
white
moon
paces
wandering
like
a
maiden
in
search
of
love
all
these
and
other
unnumbered
joys
he
has
lost
joys
that
child
of
the
high
gods
and
favorite
of
destiny
drinks
in
with
the
light
and
the
air
his
eyes
softened
with
a
dreamy
intense
lustre
that
gave
them
a
new
and
almost
pathetic
beauty
while
theos
listening
to
each
word
he
uttered
wondered
whether
there
were
ever
any
sounds
sweeter
than
the
rise
and
fall
of
his
exquisite
voice
a
voice
as
deliciously
clear
and
mellow
as
a
golden
flute
tenderly
played
yes
though
we
must
laugh
at
zabastes
we
should
also
pity
him
he
resumed
in
gayer
accents
his
fate
is
not
enviable
he
is
nothing
but
a
critic
he
could
not
well
be
a
lesser
man
one
who
unable
himself
to
do
any
great
work
takes
refuge
in
finding
fault
with
the
works
of
others
and
those
who
abhor
true
poesy
are
in
time
themselves
abhorred
the
balance
of
justice
never
errs
in
these
things
the
poet
wins
the
whole
world
love
and
immortal
fame
his
adverse
critic
brief
contempt
and
measureless
oblivion
come
he
added
addressing
theos
we
will
leave
these
maidens
to
their
duties
and
pastimes
niphrata
here
his
dazzling
smile
flashed
like
a
beam
of
sunlight
over
his
face
thou
wilt
bring
us
fruit
and
wine
yonder
we
shall
pass
the
afternoon
together
within
doors
bid
my
steward
prepare
the
rose
chamber
for
my
guest
and
let
athazel
and
zimra
attend
there
to
wait
upon
him
all
the
maidens
saluted
touching
their
heads
with
their
hands
in
token
of
obedience
and
leading
the
way
courteously
beckoned
theos
to
follow
he
did
so
conscious
as
he
went
of
two
distinct
impressions
first
that
the
mysterious
mental
agitation
he
had
suffered
from
when
he
had
found
himself
so
unexpectedly
in
a
strange
city
was
not
completely
dispelled
and
secondly
that
he
felt
as
though
he
must
have
known
all
his
life
his
memory
still
remained
a
blank
as
regarded
his
past
career
but
this
fact
had
ceased
to
trouble
him
and
he
was
perfectly
tranquil
and
altogether
satisfied
with
his
present
surroundings
in
short
to
be
in
seemed
to
him
quite
in
keeping
with
the
necessary
course
of
events
while
to
be
the
friend
and
companion
of
was
more
natural
and
familiar
to
his
mind
than
all
once
natural
and
familiar
things
chapter
xiii
a
poet
palace
gliding
along
with
that
graceful
almost
swiftness
of
movement
that
was
so
much
a
part
of
his
manner
escorted
his
visitor
to
the
further
end
of
the
great
hall
there
throwing
aside
a
curtain
of
rich
azure
silk
which
partially
draped
two
large
he
ushered
him
into
a
magnificent
apartment
opening
out
upon
the
terrace
and
garden
beyond
a
garden
filled
with
such
a
marvellous
profusion
of
foliage
and
flowers
that
looking
at
it
from
between
the
glistening
marble
columns
surrounding
the
palace
it
seemed
as
though
the
very
sky
above
rested
on
towering
pyramids
of
red
and
white
bloom
awnings
of
pale
blue
stretched
from
the
windows
across
the
entire
width
of
the
spacious
outer
colonnade
and
here
two
small
boys
half
nude
and
black
as
polished
ebony
were
huddled
together
on
the
mosaic
pavement
watching
the
arrogant
deportment
of
a
superb
peacock
that
strutted
majestically
to
and
fro
with
boastfully
spreading
tail
and
glittering
crest
as
brilliant
as
the
gleam
of
the
hot
sun
on
the
silver
fringe
of
the
azure
canopies
up
lazy
rascals
cried
imperiously
as
with
the
extreme
point
of
his
sandaled
foot
he
touched
the
dimpled
shiny
back
of
the
nearest
boy
up
and
away
fetch
and
sweet
perfumes
hither
by
the
gods
ye
have
let
the
incense
in
yonder
burner
smoulder
and
he
pointed
to
a
massive
brazen
vessel
gorgeously
ornamented
from
whence
rose
but
the
very
faintest
blue
whiff
of
fragrant
smoke
off
with
ye
both
ye
basking
blackamoors
bring
fresh
frankincense
and
wherewith
to
stir
this
heated
air
hence
and
back
again
like
a
or
out
of
my
sight
forever
while
he
spoke
the
little
fellows
stood
trembling
and
ducking
their
woolly
heads
as
though
they
half
expected
to
be
seized
by
their
irate
master
and
flung
like
black
balls
out
into
the
wilderness
of
flowers
but
glancing
timidly
up
and
perceiving
that
even
in
the
midst
of
his
petulance
he
smiled
they
took
courage
and
as
soon
as
he
had
ceased
they
darted
off
with
the
swiftness
of
flying
arrows
each
striving
to
outstrip
the
other
in
a
race
across
the
terrace
and
garden
laughed
as
he
watched
them
disappear
and
then
stepping
back
into
the
interior
of
the
apartment
he
turned
to
theos
and
bade
him
be
seated
theos
sank
unresistingly
into
a
low
chair
richly
carved
and
inlaid
with
ivory
and
stretching
his
limbs
indolently
therein
surveyed
with
new
and
admiration
the
supple
elegant
figure
of
his
host
who
throwing
himself
full
length
on
a
couch
covered
with
folded
his
arms
behind
his
head
and
eyed
his
guest
with
a
complacent
smile
of
vanity
and
is
not
an
altogether
unfitting
retreat
for
a
poet
musings
he
said
assuming
an
air
of
indifference
as
he
glanced
round
his
luxurious
almost
royally
appointed
room
i
have
heard
of
worse
but
truly
it
needs
the
highest
art
of
all
known
nations
to
worthily
deck
a
habitation
wherein
the
divine
muse
may
daily
dwell
nevertheless
air
light
and
flowers
are
not
lacking
and
on
these
methinks
i
could
subsist
were
i
deprived
of
all
other
things
theos
sat
silent
looking
about
him
wistfully
was
ever
poet
king
or
even
emperor
housed
more
sumptuously
than
this
he
thought
as
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
domed
ceiling
wreathed
with
carved
clusters
of
grapes
and
pomegranates
the
walls
frescoed
with
glowing
scenes
of
love
and
the
groups
of
superb
statuary
that
gleamed
whitely
out
of
dusky
corners
the
quaintly
shaped
overflowing
with
books
and
made
so
as
to
revolve
round
and
round
at
a
touch
or
move
to
and
fro
on
noiseless
wheels
the
grand
busts
both
in
bronze
and
marble
that
stood
on
tall
pedestals
or
projecting
bracket
and
while
he
dimly
noted
all
these
splendid
evidences
of
unlimited
wealth
and
luxury
the
perfume
and
lustre
of
the
place
the
glitter
of
gold
and
azure
silver
and
scarlet
the
oriental
languor
pervading
the
very
air
and
above
all
the
rich
amber
and
light
that
bathed
every
object
in
a
and
fairy
radiance
plunged
his
senses
into
a
delicious
confusion
a
throbbing
fever
of
delight
to
which
he
could
give
no
name
but
which
permeated
every
fibre
of
his
being
he
felt
half
blinded
with
the
brilliancy
of
the
scene
the
dazzling
glow
of
color
the
sheen
of
deep
and
delicate
hues
cunningly
intermixed
and
contrasted
the
gorgeous
lavishness
of
waving
blossoms
that
seemed
to
surge
up
like
a
sea
to
the
very
windows
and
though
many
thoughts
flitted
hazily
through
his
brain
he
could
not
shape
them
into
utterance
he
stared
vaguely
at
the
floor
it
was
paved
with
variegated
mosaic
and
strewn
with
the
soft
dark
furry
skins
of
wild
animals
at
a
little
distance
from
where
he
sat
there
was
a
huge
bronze
lectern
supported
by
a
sculptured
griffin
with
horns
horns
which
curving
over
at
the
top
turned
upward
again
in
the
form
of
candelabra
the
had
brought
in
the
harp
and
it
now
stood
in
a
conspicuous
position
decked
with
myrtle
some
of
the
garlands
woven
by
the
maidens
being
no
doubt
used
for
this
purpose
yet
there
was
something
and
fantastic
in
the
splendor
that
everywhere
surrounded
him
he
felt
as
though
he
were
one
of
the
spectators
in
a
vast
auditorium
where
the
curtain
had
just
risen
on
the
first
scene
of
the
play
he
was
dubiously
considering
in
his
own
perplexed
mind
whether
such
princely
living
were
the
privilege
or
right
or
custom
of
poets
in
general
when
spoke
again
waving
his
hand
toward
one
of
the
busts
near
him
a
massive
frowning
head
magnificently
sculptured
there
is
the
glorious
orazel
he
said
the
father
as
we
all
must
own
of
the
art
of
poesy
and
indeed
of
all
true
literature
yet
there
be
some
who
swear
he
never
lived
at
all
aye
though
his
poems
have
come
down
to
us
and
many
are
the
arguments
i
have
had
with
wise
men
like
zabastes
concerning
his
style
and
method
of
versification
everything
he
has
written
bears
the
impress
of
the
same
nevertheless
garrulous
controversialists
hold
that
his
famous
work
the
descended
by
oral
tradition
from
mouth
to
mouth
till
it
came
to
us
in
its
present
condition
and
laughed
disdainfully
as
if
the
mumbling
of
an
epic
poem
from
grandsire
to
grandson
could
possibly
improve
it
it
would
rather
be
deteriorated
if
not
altogether
changed
into
the
merest
doggerel
nay
nay
the
is
the
achievement
of
one
great
mind
not
twenty
oruzels
were
born
in
succession
to
write
it
there
was
there
could
be
only
one
and
he
by
right
supreme
is
chief
of
the
bards
immortal
as
well
might
fools
hereafter
wrangle
together
and
say
there
were
many
only
i
have
taken
good
heed
posterity
shall
know
there
was
only
one
unmatched
for
singing
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
world
he
sprang
up
from
his
recumbent
posture
and
attracted
theos
attention
to
another
bust
even
finer
than
the
last
it
was
placed
on
a
pedestal
wreathed
at
the
summit
and
at
the
base
with
laurel
the
divine
hyspiros
he
exclaimed
pointing
to
it
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
the
master
from
whom
it
may
be
i
have
caught
the
perfect
entrancement
of
my
own
his
fame
as
thou
knowest
is
unrivalled
and
universal
yet
canst
thou
believe
it
there
has
been
of
late
an
ass
found
in
who
hath
chosen
him
as
a
subject
for
his
braying
and
other
asses
join
in
the
uneuphonius
chorus
the
marvellous
plays
of
hyspiros
the
grandest
tragedies
the
airiest
comedies
the
tenderest
fantasies
ever
created
by
human
brain
have
been
called
in
question
by
these
animals
and
one
most
untractable
hath
made
pretence
to
discover
therein
a
passage
of
secret
writing
which
shall
so
the
fool
thinks
prove
that
hyspiros
was
not
the
author
of
his
own
works
but
only
a
literary
cheat
and
forger
of
another
and
lesser
man
inspiration
by
the
gods
sides
would
split
with
laughter
at
the
silly
brute
were
he
not
altogether
too
contemptible
to
provoke
even
derision
hyspiros
a
traitor
to
the
art
he
served
and
glorified
hyspiros
a
literary
juggler
and
trickster
by
the
serpent
head
they
may
as
well
seek
to
prove
the
fiery
sun
in
heaven
a
common
as
strive
to
lessen
by
one
iota
the
transcendent
glory
of
the
noblest
poet
the
centuries
have
ever
seen
warmed
by
enthusiasm
with
his
eyes
flashing
and
the
impetuous
words
coursing
from
his
lips
his
head
thrown
back
his
hand
uplifted
looked
magnificent
and
theos
to
whose
misty
brain
the
names
of
oruzel
and
hyspiros
carried
no
positively
distinct
meaning
was
nevertheless
struck
by
a
certain
suggestiveness
in
his
remarks
that
seemed
to
bear
on
some
discussion
in
the
literary
world
that
had
taken
place
quite
recently
he
was
puzzled
and
tried
to
fix
the
precise
point
round
which
his
thoughts
strayed
so
hesitatingly
but
he
could
arrive
at
no
definite
conclusion
the
brilliant
meantime
flashed
hither
and
thither
about
the
room
selecting
certain
volumes
from
his
loaded
and
bringing
them
in
a
pile
he
set
them
on
a
small
table
by
his
visitor
side
these
are
some
of
the
earliest
editions
of
the
plays
of
hyspiros
he
went
on
talking
in
that
rapid
fluent
way
of
his
that
was
as
musical
as
a
bird
song
they
are
rare
and
curious
see
you
the
names
of
the
scribes
and
the
dates
of
issue
are
all
distinct
ah
the
treasures
of
poetry
enshrined
within
these
pages
was
ever
papyrus
so
gemmed
with
pearls
of
thought
and
wisdom
if
there
were
a
next
world
my
friend
and
here
he
placed
his
hand
familiarly
on
his
shoulder
while
the
bright
sparkled
in
his
splendid
eyes
be
worth
dwelling
in
for
the
sake
of
hyspiros
as
grand
a
god
as
any
of
the
thunderers
in
the
empyrean
surely
there
is
a
next
world
murmured
theos
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
a
world
where
thou
and
i
and
all
the
masters
and
servants
of
song
shall
meet
and
hold
high
festival
laughed
again
a
little
sadly
this
time
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
believe
it
not
he
said
and
there
was
a
touch
of
melancholy
in
his
rich
voice
we
are
midges
in
a
sunbeam
emmets
on
a
no
more
is
there
a
next
world
thinkest
thou
for
the
bees
who
die
of
surfeit
in
the
for
the
whirling
drift
of
brilliant
butterflies
that
sleepily
float
with
the
wind
unknowing
whither
till
met
by
the
icy
blast
of
the
north
they
fall
like
broken
and
colorless
leaves
in
the
dust
of
the
is
there
a
next
world
for
this
and
he
took
from
a
tall
vase
near
at
hand
a
delicate
flower
and
deliciously
odorous
the
expression
of
its
soul
or
mind
is
in
its
fragrance
even
as
the
expression
of
ours
finds
vent
in
thought
and
aspiration
have
we
more
right
to
live
again
than
this
most
innocently
fair
blossom
unsmirched
by
deeds
of
evil
nay
i
would
more
easily
believe
in
a
heaven
for
birds
and
flowers
than
for
women
and
men
a
shadow
of
pain
darkened
his
handsome
face
as
he
spoke
and
theos
gazing
full
at
him
became
suddenly
filled
with
pity
and
anxiety
he
passionately
longed
to
assure
him
that
there
was
in
very
truth
a
future
higher
and
happier
existence
he
theos
would
vouch
for
the
fact
but
how
and
why
what
could
he
say
what
could
he
prove
his
throat
ached
his
eyeballs
burned
he
was
as
it
were
forbidden
to
speak
notwithstanding
the
yearning
desire
he
felt
to
impart
to
the
soul
of
his
friend
something
of
that
indescribable
sense
of
everlastingness
which
he
himself
was
now
conscious
of
even
as
one
set
free
of
prison
is
conscious
of
liberty
mute
and
with
a
feeling
as
of
hot
unshed
tears
welling
up
from
his
very
heart
he
turned
over
the
volumes
of
hyspiros
almost
mechanically
they
were
formed
of
sheets
of
papyrus
artistically
bound
in
loose
leather
coverings
and
tied
together
with
ribbon
the
kyrisian
language
was
as
has
been
before
stated
perfectly
familiar
to
him
though
he
could
not
tell
how
he
had
acquired
the
knowledge
of
it
and
he
was
able
to
see
at
a
glance
that
had
good
cause
to
be
enthusiastic
in
his
praise
of
the
author
whose
genius
he
so
fervently
admired
there
was
a
ringing
richness
in
the
rush
of
the
verse
a
wealth
of
simile
combined
with
a
simplicity
and
directness
of
utterance
that
charmed
the
ear
while
influencing
the
mind
and
he
was
beginning
to
read
in
the
opening
lines
of
a
spirited
running
thus
i
tell
thee
o
thou
pride
enthroned
king
that
from
these
peaceful
fields
these
harvest
lands
strange
crops
shall
spring
not
sown
by
thee
or
thine
arm
millions
bristling
weapons
helmed
men
dreadfully
plum
and
eager
for
the
fray
steel
crested
myrmidons
toss
spears
wild
steeds
uplifted
flags
and
pennons
horrid
swords
death
gleaming
eyes
stern
hands
to
grasp
and
tear
life
from
beseeching
life
till
all
the
heavens
strike
havoc
to
the
stars
when
the
two
small
black
pages
lately
dispatched
in
such
haste
by
returned
each
one
bearing
a
huge
gilded
bowl
filled
with
rose
water
together
with
fine
cloths
and
soft
as
satin
kneeling
humbly
down
one
before
theos
the
other
before
they
lifted
these
great
shining
bowls
on
their
heads
and
remained
motionless
dipped
his
face
and
hands
in
the
cool
fragrant
fluid
theos
followed
his
example
and
when
these
light
ablutions
were
completed
the
pages
disappeared
coming
back
almost
immediately
with
baskets
of
loose
white
and
red
which
they
scattered
profusely
about
the
room
a
delightful
odor
subtly
sweet
and
yet
not
faint
began
to
freshen
the
already
perfumed
air
and
flinging
himself
again
on
his
couch
motioned
theos
to
take
a
similar
opposite
he
at
once
obeyed
yielding
anew
to
the
sense
of
indolent
luxury
and
voluptuous
ease
his
surroundings
engendered
and
presently
the
aroma
of
rising
incense
mingled
itself
with
the
scent
of
the
strewn
the
pages
had
replenished
the
and
now
these
duties
done
so
far
they
brought
each
a
broad
long
stalked
and
placing
themselves
in
proper
position
began
to
fan
the
two
young
men
slowly
and
with
measured
gentleness
standing
as
mute
as
little
black
statues
the
only
movement
about
them
being
the
occasional
rolling
of
their
white
eyeballs
and
the
swaying
to
and
fro
of
their
shiny
arms
as
they
wielded
the
graceful
bending
leaves
this
is
the
way
a
poet
should
ever
live
murmured
theos
glancing
up
from
the
soft
cushions
among
which
he
reclined
to
who
lay
with
his
eyes
and
a
musing
smile
on
his
beautiful
mouth
self
centered
in
a
circle
of
beauty
with
naught
but
fair
suggestions
and
sweet
thoughts
to
break
the
charm
of
solitude
a
kingdom
of
happy
fancies
should
be
his
with
gates
shut
last
against
unwelcome
intruders
gates
that
should
never
open
save
to
the
conquering
touch
of
woman
kiss
for
the
of
love
must
unlock
all
doors
even
the
doors
of
a
minstrel
dreaming
thinkest
thou
so
said
lazily
turning
his
dark
delicate
head
slightly
round
on
his
glistening
satin
pillow
nay
of
a
truth
there
are
times
when
i
could
bar
out
women
from
my
thoughts
as
mere
disturbers
of
the
translucent
element
of
poesy
in
which
my
spirit
bathes
there
is
fatigue
in
love
whose
pretty
human
butterflies
too
oft
weary
the
flower
whose
honey
they
seek
to
drain
nevertheless
the
passion
of
love
hath
a
certain
tingling
pleasure
in
it
i
yield
to
it
when
it
touches
me
even
as
i
yield
to
all
other
pleasant
things
but
there
are
some
who
unwisely
carry
desire
too
far
and
make
of
love
a
misery
instead
of
a
pastime
many
will
die
for
love
fools
are
they
all
to
die
for
fame
for
glory
that
i
can
understand
but
for
love
he
laughed
and
taking
up
a
crushed
he
flipped
it
into
the
air
with
his
finger
and
thumb
i
would
as
soon
die
for
sake
of
that
perished
leaf
as
for
sake
of
a
woman
transient
beauty
as
he
uttered
these
words
niphrata
entered
carrying
a
golden
salver
on
which
were
placed
a
tall
flagon
two
goblets
and
a
basket
of
fruit
she
approached
theos
first
and
he
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
surveyed
her
with
fresh
admiration
and
interest
while
he
poured
out
the
wine
from
the
flagon
into
one
of
those
glistening
cups
which
he
noticed
were
rough
with
the
quantity
of
small
gems
used
in
their
outer
ornamentation
he
was
struck
by
her
fair
and
melancholy
style
of
loveliness
and
as
she
stood
before
him
with
lowered
eyes
the
color
alternately
flushing
and
paling
on
her
cheeks
and
her
bosom
heaving
restlessly
beneath
the
loosely
drawn
folds
of
her
prim
gown
an
inexplicable
emotion
of
pity
smote
him
as
if
he
had
suddenly
been
made
aware
of
some
inward
sorrow
of
hers
which
he
was
utterly
powerless
to
console
he
would
have
spoken
but
just
then
could
find
nothing
appropriate
to
say
and
when
he
had
selected
a
fine
peach
from
the
dainties
offered
for
his
choice
he
still
watched
her
as
she
turned
to
who
smiled
and
bade
her
set
down
her
salver
on
a
low
bronze
stand
at
his
side
she
did
so
and
then
with
the
warm
blood
burning
in
her
cheeks
stood
waiting
and
silent
with
a
lithe
movement
of
his
supple
form
lifted
himself
into
a
posture
and
throwing
one
arm
round
her
waist
drew
her
close
to
his
breast
and
kissed
her
my
fairest
moonbeam
he
said
gayly
thou
art
as
noiseless
and
placid
as
thy
yet
unembodied
sisters
that
stream
through
heaven
and
dance
on
the
river
when
the
world
is
sleeping
myrtle
and
he
detached
a
spray
from
the
bosom
of
her
dress
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
the
poet
garland
by
my
faith
thou
art
like
theos
yonder
and
hast
chosen
to
wear
a
sprig
of
my
faded
crown
for
thine
adornment
not
so
a
hot
and
painful
blush
crimsoned
niphrata
face
a
softness
as
of
suppressed
tears
glistened
in
her
eyes
she
made
no
answer
but
looked
beseechingly
at
the
little
twig
held
silly
child
he
went
on
laughingly
replacing
it
himself
against
her
bosom
where
the
breath
seemed
to
struggle
with
such
panting
haste
and
fear
thou
art
welcome
to
the
dead
leaves
sanctified
by
song
if
thou
thinkest
them
of
value
but
i
would
rather
see
the
rosebud
of
love
nestled
in
that
pretty
white
breast
of
thine
than
the
ornaments
of
fame
and
filling
himself
a
cup
of
wine
he
raised
it
aloft
looking
at
theos
smilingly
as
he
did
so
to
your
health
my
noble
friend
he
cried
and
to
the
joys
of
the
passing
hour
a
wise
toast
answered
theos
placing
his
lips
to
his
own
rim
for
the
past
is
past
never
return
the
future
we
know
not
and
only
the
present
can
be
called
our
own
to
the
health
of
the
divine
whose
fame
is
my
glory
whose
friendship
is
dear
to
me
as
life
and
with
this
he
drained
off
the
wine
to
the
last
drop
scarcely
had
he
done
so
when
the
most
curious
sensation
overcame
him
a
sensation
of
bewildering
ecstasy
as
though
he
had
drunk
of
some
ambrosian
nectar
or
magic
drug
which
had
suddenly
wound
up
his
nerves
to
an
acute
tension
of
indescribable
delight
the
blood
coursed
more
swiftly
through
his
veins
he
felt
his
face
flush
with
the
impulsive
heat
and
ardor
of
the
moment
he
laughed
as
he
set
the
cup
down
empty
and
throwing
himself
back
on
his
luxurious
couch
his
eyes
flashed
on
with
a
bright
comprehensive
glance
of
complete
confidence
and
affection
it
was
strange
to
note
how
quickly
returned
that
glance
how
thoroughly
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
their
friendship
had
cemented
itself
into
a
more
than
fraternal
bond
of
union
niphrata
meanwhile
stood
a
little
aside
her
wistful
looks
wandering
from
one
to
the
other
as
though
in
something
of
doubt
or
wonder
presently
she
spoke
inclining
her
fair
head
toward
my
lord
goes
to
the
palace
to
make
his
valued
voice
heard
in
the
presence
of
the
king
she
inquired
timidly
even
so
niphrata
responded
the
laureate
passing
his
hand
carelessly
through
his
clustering
curls
i
have
been
summoned
thither
by
the
royal
command
but
what
of
that
little
one
thou
knowest
is
a
common
occurrence
and
that
the
court
is
bereft
of
all
pleasure
and
sweetness
when
is
silent
my
lord
guest
goes
with
him
pursued
niphrata
gently
aye
most
assuredly
and
smiled
at
theos
as
he
spoke
thou
wilt
accompany
me
to
the
king
my
friend
he
went
on
he
will
give
thee
a
welcome
for
my
sake
and
though
of
a
truth
his
majesty
is
most
potently
ignorant
of
all
things
save
the
arts
of
love
and
warfare
nevertheless
he
is
man
as
well
as
monarch
and
thou
wilt
find
him
noble
in
his
greeting
and
generous
of
hospitality
i
will
go
with
thee
anywhere
replied
theos
quickly
for
in
following
such
a
guide
i
follow
my
own
most
perfect
pleasure
niphrata
looked
at
him
meditatively
with
a
melancholy
expression
in
her
lovely
eyes
my
lord
presence
indeed
brings
joy
she
said
softly
and
tremulously
but
the
joy
is
too
sweet
and
brief
for
when
he
departs
none
can
fill
the
place
he
leaves
vacant
she
paused
gaze
rested
on
her
intently
a
light
leaping
from
under
the
drooping
shade
of
his
long
silky
black
lashes
she
caught
the
look
and
a
little
shiver
ran
through
her
delicate
frame
she
pressed
one
hand
on
her
heart
and
resumed
in
steadier
and
more
even
tones
my
lord
has
perhaps
not
heard
of
the
disturbances
of
the
early
morning
in
the
city
she
asked
the
riotous
crowd
in
the
marketplace
the
ravings
of
the
prophet
khosrul
the
sudden
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
many
and
the
consequent
wrath
of
the
king
no
by
my
faith
returned
yawning
slightly
and
settling
his
head
more
comfortably
on
his
pillows
nor
do
i
care
to
heed
the
turbulence
of
a
mob
that
can
not
guide
itself
and
yet
resists
all
guidance
arrests
imprisonments
they
are
common
but
why
in
the
name
of
the
sacred
veil
do
they
not
arrest
and
imprison
the
actual
disturbers
of
the
peace
the
mystics
and
philosophers
whose
street
orations
filter
through
the
mind
of
the
disaffected
rousing
them
to
foolish
frenzy
and
disordered
action
why
above
all
men
do
they
not
seize
khosrul
a
veritable
madman
for
all
his
many
years
and
seeming
wisdom
hath
he
not
denounced
the
faith
of
nagaya
and
foretold
the
destruction
of
the
city
times
out
of
number
and
are
we
not
all
weary
to
death
of
his
bombastic
mouthing
if
the
king
deemed
a
counsel
worth
the
taking
he
would
long
ago
have
shut
this
bearded
ranter
within
the
four
walls
of
a
dungeon
where
only
rats
and
spiders
would
attend
his
lectures
on
approaching
doom
nay
but
my
lord
niphrata
ventured
to
say
timidly
the
king
dare
not
lay
hands
on
khosrul
dare
not
laughed
lazily
stretching
out
his
hand
and
helping
himself
to
a
luscious
nectarine
from
the
basket
at
his
side
sweet
niphrata
settest
thou
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
king
as
well
draw
a
for
the
imagination
of
the
poet
khosrul
may
be
loved
and
feared
by
a
certain
number
of
superstitious
malcontents
who
look
upon
a
madman
as
a
sort
of
sacred
wild
animal
but
the
actual
population
of
the
people
who
are
the
blood
bone
and
sinew
of
the
city
these
are
not
in
favor
of
change
either
in
religion
laws
manners
or
customs
but
khosrul
is
old
and
that
the
king
humors
his
vagaries
is
simply
out
of
pity
for
his
age
and
infirmity
niphrata
not
because
of
fear
our
monarch
knows
no
fear
khosrul
prophesies
terrible
things
murmured
the
girl
hesitatingly
i
have
often
thought
if
they
should
come
true
thou
timid
dove
and
rising
from
his
couch
kissed
her
neck
lightly
thus
causing
a
delicate
flush
of
crimson
to
ripple
through
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
think
no
more
of
such
folly
thou
wilt
anger
me
that
a
doting
graybeard
like
khosrul
should
trouble
the
peace
of
the
magnificent
by
the
gods
the
whole
thing
is
absurd
let
me
hear
no
more
of
mobs
or
riots
or
my
soul
abhors
even
the
suggestion
of
discord
tranquillity
divinest
calm
disturbed
only
by
the
flutterings
of
winged
thoughts
hovering
over
the
cloudless
heaven
of
fancy
this
this
alone
is
the
sum
and
centre
of
my
and
i
find
that
even
thou
niphrata
here
his
voice
took
upon
itself
an
injured
tone
thou
who
art
usually
so
gentle
hast
somewhat
troubled
the
placidity
of
my
mind
by
thy
foolish
talk
concerning
common
and
unpleasant
circumstances
he
stopped
short
and
a
line
of
vexation
and
annoyance
made
its
appearance
between
his
broad
beautiful
brows
while
niphrata
seeing
this
expression
of
almost
in
the
face
she
adored
threw
herself
suddenly
at
his
feet
and
raising
her
lovely
eyes
swimming
in
tears
she
exclaimed
my
lord
of
niphrata
soul
forgive
me
it
is
true
thou
shouldst
never
hear
of
strife
or
contention
among
the
coarser
tribe
of
men
and
i
i
poor
niphrata
would
give
my
life
to
shield
thee
from
the
faintest
shadow
of
annoy
i
would
have
thy
path
all
woven
sunbeams
thou
shouldst
live
like
a
fairy
monarch
embowered
roses
sheltered
from
rough
winds
and
folded
in
loving
arms
fairer
maybe
but
not
more
fond
than
mine
her
voice
broke
stooping
she
kissed
the
silver
fastening
of
his
sandal
and
springing
up
rushed
from
the
room
before
a
word
could
be
uttered
to
bid
her
stay
looked
after
her
with
a
pretty
perplexity
she
is
often
thus
he
said
in
a
tone
of
playful
resignation
as
i
told
thee
theos
women
are
butterflies
hovering
hither
and
thither
on
uneasy
pinions
uncertain
of
their
own
desires
niphrata
is
a
sometimes
she
angers
me
sometimes
she
soothes
now
she
prattles
of
things
that
concern
me
not
and
anon
converses
with
such
high
and
lofty
earnestness
of
speech
that
i
listen
amazed
and
wonder
where
she
hath
gathered
up
her
store
of
seeming
wisdom
love
teaches
her
all
she
knows
interrupted
theos
quickly
and
with
a
meaning
glance
laughed
languidly
a
faint
color
warming
the
clear
olive
pallor
of
his
complexion
aye
poor
tender
little
soul
she
loves
me
he
said
carelessly
that
is
no
secret
but
then
all
women
love
me
i
am
more
like
to
die
of
a
surfeit
of
love
than
of
anything
else
he
moved
towards
the
open
window
come
he
added
it
is
the
hour
of
sunset
there
is
a
green
hillock
in
my
garden
yonder
from
whence
we
can
behold
the
pomp
and
panoply
of
the
golden
god
departure
is
a
sight
i
never
miss
i
would
have
thee
share
its
glory
with
me
but
art
thou
then
indifferent
to
woman
tenderness
asked
theos
half
banteringly
as
he
took
his
arm
dost
thou
love
no
one
my
friend
replied
seriously
i
love
myself
i
see
naught
that
contents
me
more
than
my
own
personality
and
with
all
my
heart
i
admire
the
miracle
and
beauty
of
my
own
existence
there
is
nothing
even
in
the
completest
fairness
of
womanhood
that
satisfies
me
so
much
as
the
contemplation
of
my
own
genius
realizing
as
i
do
its
wondrous
power
and
perfect
charm
the
life
of
a
poet
such
as
i
am
is
a
perpetual
marvel
the
whole
universe
ministers
to
my
needs
humanity
becomes
the
merest
bound
slave
to
the
caprice
of
my
imperial
imagination
with
a
thought
i
scale
the
stars
with
a
wish
i
float
in
highest
ether
among
spheres
undiscovered
yet
familiar
to
my
fancy
i
converse
with
the
spirits
of
flowers
and
fountains
and
the
love
of
women
is
a
mere
drop
in
the
deep
ocean
of
my
unfathomed
delight
yes
i
adore
my
own
identity
and
of
a
truth
is
the
only
creed
the
world
has
ever
followed
faithfully
to
the
end
he
glanced
up
with
a
bright
assured
smile
theos
met
his
gaze
wonderingly
doubtfully
but
made
no
reply
and
together
they
paced
slowly
across
the
marble
terrace
and
out
into
the
glorious
garden
rich
with
the
riotous
roses
that
clambered
and
clustered
everywhere
their
hues
deepening
to
vividness
in
the
burning
radiance
of
the
sinking
sun
chapter
xiv
the
summons
of
the
signet
they
walked
side
by
side
for
some
little
time
without
speaking
through
winding
paths
of
alternate
light
and
shade
sheltered
by
the
latticework
of
crossed
and
twisted
green
boughs
where
only
the
amorous
chant
of
charming
birds
now
and
then
broke
the
silence
with
fitful
and
tender
sweetness
all
the
air
about
them
was
fragrant
and
delicate
tiny
midges
whirled
round
and
danced
in
the
warm
like
flecks
of
gold
in
amber
wine
while
here
and
there
the
distant
glimmer
of
tossing
fountains
or
the
soft
emerald
sheen
of
a
prattling
brook
that
wound
in
and
out
the
grounds
amongst
banks
of
moss
and
drooping
fern
gave
a
pleasant
touch
of
coolness
and
refreshment
to
the
brilliant
verdure
of
the
luxuriant
landscape
speaking
of
creeds
said
theos
at
last
looking
down
with
a
curious
sense
of
compassion
and
protection
at
his
companion
slight
graceful
form
what
religion
is
it
that
dominates
this
city
and
people
through
want
of
knowledge
it
seems
i
committed
a
nearly
unpardonable
offence
by
gazing
at
the
beauty
of
the
virgin
priestess
when
i
should
have
knelt
to
her
benediction
thou
must
tell
me
something
of
the
common
laws
of
worship
that
i
err
not
thus
blindly
again
smiled
the
common
laws
of
worship
are
the
common
laws
of
custom
he
replied
no
more
no
less
and
in
this
we
are
much
like
other
nations
we
believe
in
no
actual
creed
who
does
we
accept
a
certain
given
definition
of
a
supposititious
divinity
together
with
the
suitable
maxims
and
code
of
morals
accompanying
that
definition
we
call
this
religion
and
we
wear
it
as
we
wear
our
clothing
for
the
sake
of
necessity
and
decency
though
truly
we
are
not
half
so
concerned
about
it
as
about
the
far
more
interesting
details
of
taste
in
attire
still
we
have
grown
used
to
our
doctrine
and
some
of
us
will
fight
with
each
other
for
the
difference
of
a
word
respecting
it
and
as
it
contains
within
itself
many
seeds
of
discord
and
contradiction
such
dissensions
are
frequent
especially
among
the
priests
who
were
they
but
true
to
their
professed
vocation
should
be
able
to
find
ways
of
smoothing
over
all
apparent
inconsistencies
and
maintaining
peace
and
order
of
course
we
in
union
with
all
civilized
communities
worship
the
sun
even
as
thou
must
do
in
this
one
leading
principle
at
least
our
faith
is
universal
theos
bent
his
head
in
assent
he
was
scarcely
conscious
of
the
action
but
at
that
moment
he
felt
with
that
there
was
no
other
form
of
divinity
acknowledged
in
the
world
than
the
refulgent
orb
that
gladdens
and
illumines
earth
and
visibly
controls
the
seasons
and
yet
went
on
thoughtfully
the
know
through
our
scientists
and
astronomers
many
of
whom
are
now
languishing
in
prison
for
the
boldness
of
their
researches
and
discoveries
that
the
sun
is
no
divinity
at
all
but
simply
a
huge
planet
a
dense
body
surrounded
by
a
luminous
atmosphere
neither
nor
omnipotent
but
only
one
of
many
similar
orbs
moving
in
strict
obedience
to
fixed
mathematical
laws
nevertheless
this
knowledge
is
wisely
kept
back
as
much
as
possible
from
the
multitude
for
were
science
to
unveil
her
marvels
too
openly
to
and
vulgarly
constituted
minds
the
result
would
be
first
atheism
next
republicanism
and
finally
anarchy
and
ruin
if
these
evils
which
like
birds
of
prey
continually
hover
about
all
great
kingdoms
are
to
be
averted
we
must
for
the
welfare
of
the
country
and
people
hold
fast
to
some
stated
form
and
outward
observance
of
religious
belief
he
paused
theos
gave
him
a
quick
searching
glance
even
if
such
a
belief
should
have
no
shadow
of
a
true
foundation
he
inquired
can
it
be
well
for
men
to
cling
superstitiously
to
a
false
doctrine
appeared
to
consider
this
question
in
his
own
mind
for
some
minutes
before
replying
my
friend
it
is
difficult
to
decide
what
is
false
and
what
is
true
he
said
at
last
with
a
little
shrug
of
his
shoulders
but
i
think
that
even
a
false
religion
is
better
for
the
masses
than
none
at
all
men
are
closely
allied
to
brutes
if
the
moral
sense
ceases
to
restrain
them
they
at
once
leap
the
boundary
line
and
give
as
much
rein
to
their
desires
and
appetites
as
the
hyenas
and
tigers
and
in
some
natures
the
moral
sense
is
only
kept
alive
by
fear
fear
of
offending
some
despotic
invisible
force
that
pervades
the
universe
and
whose
chief
and
most
terrible
attribute
is
not
so
much
creative
as
destructive
power
to
propitiate
and
pacify
an
unseen
supreme
destroyer
is
the
aim
of
all
religions
and
it
is
for
this
reason
we
add
to
our
worship
of
the
sun
that
of
the
white
serpent
nagaya
the
mediator
nagaya
is
the
favorite
object
of
the
people
adoration
they
may
forget
to
pay
their
vows
to
the
sun
but
never
to
nagaya
who
is
looked
upon
as
the
emblem
of
eternal
wisdom
the
only
pleader
whose
persuasions
avail
to
soften
the
tyrannic
humor
of
the
invincible
devourer
of
all
things
we
know
how
men
hate
wisdom
and
can
not
endure
to
be
instructed
and
yet
they
prostrate
themselves
in
abject
crowds
before
wisdom
symbol
every
day
in
the
sacred
temple
yonder
though
i
much
doubt
whether
such
constant
devotional
attendance
is
not
more
for
the
sake
of
lysia
than
the
deified
worm
he
laughed
with
a
little
undercurrent
of
scorn
in
his
laughter
and
theos
saw
as
it
were
the
lightning
of
an
angry
or
disdainful
thought
flashing
through
the
sombre
splendor
of
his
eyes
and
lysia
began
theos
suggestively
the
high
priestess
of
nagaya
responded
slowly
charmer
of
the
god
as
well
as
of
the
hearts
of
men
the
hot
passion
of
love
is
to
her
a
toy
clasped
and
unclasped
so
in
the
pink
hollow
of
her
hand
and
as
he
spoke
he
closed
his
fingers
softly
on
the
air
and
unclosed
them
again
with
an
expressive
gesture
and
so
long
as
she
retains
the
magic
of
her
beauty
so
long
will
nagaya
worship
hold
in
check
otherwise
who
knows
there
have
been
many
disturbances
of
late
the
teachings
of
the
philosophers
have
aroused
a
certain
discontent
and
there
are
those
who
are
weary
of
perpetual
sacrifices
and
the
shedding
of
innocent
blood
moreover
this
mad
khosrul
of
whom
niphrata
spoke
lately
thunders
angry
denunciations
of
lysia
and
nagaya
in
the
open
streets
with
so
much
fervid
eloquence
that
they
who
pass
by
can
not
choose
but
hear
he
hath
a
strange
craze
a
doctrine
of
the
future
which
he
most
furiously
proclaims
in
the
language
prophets
use
he
holds
that
far
away
in
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
pure
light
the
true
god
exists
a
vast
all
glorious
being
who
with
exceeding
marvellous
love
controls
and
guides
creation
toward
some
majestic
end
even
as
a
musician
doth
melodize
his
thought
from
small
sweet
notes
to
perfect
harmonies
furthermore
that
thousands
of
years
hence
this
god
will
embody
a
portion
of
his
own
existence
in
human
form
and
will
send
hither
a
wondrous
creature
to
live
our
life
die
our
death
and
teach
us
by
precept
and
example
the
surest
way
to
eternal
happiness
is
a
theory
both
strange
and
wild
hast
ever
heard
of
it
before
he
put
the
question
indifferently
but
theos
was
mute
that
horrible
sense
of
a
straining
desire
to
speak
when
speech
was
forbidden
again
oppressed
him
he
felt
as
though
he
were
being
strangled
with
his
own
unfalling
tears
what
a
crushing
weight
of
unutterable
thoughts
burdened
his
brain
he
gazed
up
at
the
serenely
glowing
sky
in
aching
dumb
despair
till
slowly
very
slowly
words
came
at
last
like
dull
throbs
of
pain
beating
between
his
lips
i
think
i
fancy
i
have
heard
a
rumor
of
such
doctrine
but
i
know
as
little
of
it
as
as
thou
i
can
tell
thee
no
more
than
thou
hast
said
he
paused
and
gaining
more
firmness
of
tone
went
on
it
seems
to
me
a
not
altogether
impossible
conception
of
divine
benevolence
for
if
god
lives
at
all
he
must
be
capable
of
manifesting
himself
in
many
ways
both
small
and
great
common
and
miraculous
though
of
a
truth
there
are
no
miracles
beyond
what
appear
as
such
to
our
limited
sight
and
restricted
intelligence
but
tell
me
and
here
his
voice
had
a
ring
of
suppressed
anxiety
within
it
tell
me
thine
own
thought
concerning
it
i
i
think
naught
of
it
replied
with
airy
contempt
such
a
creed
may
find
followers
in
time
to
come
but
now
of
what
avail
to
warn
us
of
things
that
do
not
concern
our
present
modes
of
life
moreover
in
the
face
of
all
religion
my
own
opinion
should
not
alter
i
have
studied
science
sufficiently
well
to
know
that
there
is
no
god
and
i
am
too
honest
to
worship
an
unproved
and
merely
supposititious
identity
a
shudder
as
of
extreme
cold
ran
through
theos
veins
and
as
if
impelled
on
by
some
invisible
monitor
he
said
almost
mournfully
art
thou
sure
thou
dost
not
instinctively
feel
that
there
is
a
higher
power
hidden
behind
the
veil
of
visible
nature
and
that
in
the
far
beyond
there
may
be
an
eternity
of
joy
where
thou
shalt
find
all
thy
grandest
aspirations
at
last
fulfilled
laughed
a
clear
vibrating
laugh
as
mellow
as
the
note
of
a
thrush
in
thou
solemn
soul
he
exclaimed
mirthfully
my
aspirations
are
fulfilled
i
aspire
to
no
more
than
fame
and
that
i
hold
that
i
shall
keep
so
long
as
this
world
is
lighted
by
the
sun
and
what
use
is
fame
to
thee
in
death
demanded
theos
with
sudden
and
emphatic
earnestness
stood
still
over
his
beautiful
face
came
a
shadow
of
intense
melancholy
he
raised
his
brilliant
eyes
full
of
wistful
pathos
and
pleading
i
pray
thee
do
not
make
me
sad
my
friend
he
murmured
tremulously
these
thoughts
are
like
muttering
thunder
in
my
heaven
death
and
a
quick
sigh
escaped
him
be
the
breaking
of
my
harp
and
heart
the
last
note
of
my
failing
voice
and
eversilenced
song
a
moisture
as
of
tears
glistened
on
the
silky
fringe
of
his
eyelids
his
lips
quivered
he
had
the
look
of
a
narcissus
regretfully
bewailing
his
own
perishable
loveliness
on
a
swift
impulse
of
affection
theos
threw
one
arm
round
his
neck
in
the
fashion
of
a
confiding
walking
with
his
favorite
companion
nay
thou
shalt
never
die
he
said
with
a
sort
of
passionate
eagerness
thy
bright
soul
shall
live
forever
in
a
sunshine
sweeter
than
that
of
earth
fairest
midsummer
noon
thy
song
can
never
be
silenced
while
heaven
pulsates
with
the
unwritten
music
of
the
spheres
and
even
were
the
crown
of
immortality
denied
to
lesser
men
it
is
it
must
be
the
heritage
of
the
poet
for
to
him
all
crowns
belong
all
kingdoms
are
thrown
open
all
barriers
broken
down
even
those
that
divide
us
from
the
unseen
and
god
himself
has
surely
a
smile
to
spare
for
his
singers
who
have
made
the
sad
world
joyful
if
only
for
an
hour
looked
up
with
a
pleased
yet
wondering
glance
thou
hast
a
silvery
and
persuasive
tongue
he
said
gently
and
thou
speakest
of
god
as
if
thou
knewest
one
akin
to
him
would
i
could
believe
all
thou
sayest
but
alas
i
can
not
we
have
progressed
too
far
in
knowledge
my
friend
for
faith
yet
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
with
a
touch
of
caressing
entreaty
in
his
tone
went
on
thinkest
thou
in
very
truth
that
i
shall
live
again
for
i
confess
to
thee
it
seems
beyond
all
things
strange
and
terrible
to
feel
that
this
genius
of
mine
this
spirit
of
melody
which
inhabits
my
frame
should
perish
utterly
without
further
scope
for
its
abilities
there
have
been
moments
when
my
soul
ravished
by
inspiration
has
as
it
were
seized
earth
like
a
full
goblet
of
wine
and
quaffed
its
beauties
its
pleasures
its
loves
its
glories
all
in
one
burning
draught
of
song
when
i
have
stood
in
thought
on
the
shadowy
peaks
of
time
waiting
for
other
worlds
to
string
like
beads
on
my
thread
of
poesy
when
wondrous
creatures
habited
in
light
and
wreathed
with
stars
have
floated
round
and
round
me
in
rosy
circles
of
fire
and
once
methought
was
long
ago
now
i
heard
a
voice
distinct
and
sweet
that
called
me
upward
onward
and
away
i
know
not
where
save
that
a
hidden
love
awaited
me
he
broke
off
with
a
rapt
almost
angelic
expression
in
his
eyes
then
sighing
a
little
he
resumed
all
dreams
of
course
vague
phantoms
creations
of
my
own
imaginative
brain
yet
fair
enough
to
fill
my
heart
with
speechless
longings
for
ethereal
raptures
unseen
unknown
thou
hast
methinks
a
certain
faith
in
the
unsolved
mysteries
but
i
have
none
for
sweet
as
the
promise
of
a
future
life
may
seem
there
is
no
proof
that
it
shall
ever
be
if
one
died
and
rose
again
from
the
dead
then
might
we
all
believe
and
but
otherwise
oh
miserable
theos
what
would
he
not
have
given
to
utter
aloud
the
burning
knowledge
that
ate
into
his
mind
like
fire
again
mute
again
oppressed
by
that
strange
swelling
at
the
heart
that
threatened
to
break
forth
in
stormy
sobs
of
penitence
and
prayer
instinctively
he
drew
closer
to
his
side
his
breath
came
thick
and
he
struggled
with
all
his
might
to
speak
the
words
one
has
died
and
risen
from
the
dead
but
not
a
syllable
could
he
form
of
the
desired
sentence
thou
shalt
live
again
was
all
he
could
say
in
low
accents
thou
hast
within
thee
a
flame
that
can
not
perish
again
eyes
dwelt
upon
him
with
a
curious
appealing
tenderness
thy
words
savor
of
sweet
consolation
he
said
half
gayly
half
sadly
may
they
be
fulfilled
and
if
indeed
there
is
a
brighter
world
than
this
beyond
the
skies
i
fancy
thou
and
i
will
know
each
other
there
as
here
and
be
somewhat
close
companions
see
and
he
pointed
to
a
small
green
hillock
that
rose
up
like
a
shining
emerald
from
the
darker
foliage
of
the
surrounding
trees
yonder
is
my
point
of
vantage
whence
we
shall
behold
the
sun
go
down
like
a
warrior
sinking
on
the
red
field
of
battle
the
chimes
are
ringing
even
now
for
his
departure
listen
they
stood
still
for
a
space
while
the
measured
swinging
cadence
of
bells
came
pealing
through
the
stillness
bells
of
every
tone
that
smote
the
air
with
soft
or
loud
resonance
as
the
faint
wind
wafted
the
sounds
toward
them
and
then
they
began
to
climb
the
little
hill
walking
somewhat
in
advance
with
a
tread
as
light
and
elastic
as
that
of
a
young
fawn
theos
following
watched
his
movements
with
a
strange
affection
every
turn
of
his
head
every
gesture
of
his
hand
seemed
fraught
with
meanings
as
yet
inexplicable
the
grass
beneath
their
feet
was
soft
as
velvet
and
dotted
with
a
myriad
wild
flowers
the
ascent
was
gradual
and
easy
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
reached
the
summit
where
throwing
himself
indolently
on
the
smooth
turf
pulled
theos
gently
down
by
his
side
there
they
rested
in
silence
gazing
at
the
magnificent
panorama
laid
out
before
them
a
panorama
as
lovely
as
a
delicately
pictured
scene
of
above
the
sky
was
of
a
dense
yet
misty
the
sun
low
on
the
western
horizon
appeared
to
rest
in
a
vast
deep
purple
hollow
rifted
here
and
there
with
broad
gashes
of
gold
long
shafts
of
light
streamed
upwards
in
order
like
the
waving
pennons
of
an
marching
and
beyond
far
away
from
this
blaze
of
splendid
color
the
wide
ethereal
expanse
paled
into
tender
blue
whereon
light
clouds
of
pink
and
white
drifted
like
the
fluttering
blossoms
that
fall
from
in
spring
below
and
seen
through
a
haze
of
rose
and
amber
lay
the
city
of
its
white
domes
towers
and
pinnacled
palaces
rising
out
of
the
mist
like
a
glorious
mirage
afloat
on
the
borders
of
a
burning
desert
the
magnificent
it
deserves
its
name
theos
thought
as
shading
his
eyes
from
the
red
glare
he
took
a
wondering
and
gradually
comprehensive
view
of
the
enormous
extent
of
the
place
he
soon
perceived
that
it
was
defended
by
six
strongly
fortified
walls
each
placed
within
the
other
at
long
equal
distances
apart
so
that
it
might
have
been
justly
described
as
six
cities
all
merged
together
in
one
and
from
where
he
sat
he
could
plainly
discern
the
great
square
where
he
had
rested
in
the
morning
by
reason
of
the
white
granite
obelisk
that
lifted
itself
sheer
up
against
the
sky
undwarfed
by
any
of
the
surrounding
buildings
this
gigantic
monument
was
the
most
prominent
object
in
sight
with
the
exception
of
the
sacred
temple
which
presently
pointed
out
a
round
piece
of
architecture
ornamented
with
twelve
gilded
towers
from
which
bells
were
now
clashing
and
jangling
in
a
storm
of
melodious
persistency
the
hum
of
the
city
traffic
and
pleasure
surged
on
the
air
like
the
noise
made
by
swarming
bees
while
every
now
and
then
the
sweet
shrill
tones
of
some
more
than
usually
clear
girl
voice
crying
out
the
sale
of
fruit
or
flowers
soared
up
through
the
luminous
vapor
that
the
clustering
tapering
spires
and
cupolas
in
a
delicate
nebulous
film
completely
fascinated
by
the
beauty
of
the
scene
theos
felt
as
though
he
could
never
look
upon
it
long
enough
to
master
all
its
charms
but
his
eyes
ached
with
the
radiance
in
which
everything
seemed
drenched
as
with
flame
and
turning
his
gaze
once
more
toward
the
sun
he
saw
that
it
had
nearly
disappeared
only
a
rim
peered
spectrally
above
the
gold
and
green
immediately
overhead
a
silver
rift
in
the
sky
had
widened
slowly
in
the
centre
and
narrowed
at
its
end
thus
taking
the
shape
of
a
great
outstretched
sword
that
pointed
directly
downward
at
the
busy
murmuring
glittering
city
beneath
it
was
a
strange
effect
and
made
on
the
mind
of
theos
a
strange
impression
he
was
about
to
call
attention
to
it
when
an
uncomfortable
consciousness
that
they
were
no
longer
alone
came
over
him
instinctively
he
turned
round
uttered
a
hasty
exclamation
and
springing
erect
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
huge
black
a
man
of
some
six
feet
in
height
and
muscular
in
proportion
who
clad
in
a
vest
and
tunic
of
the
most
vivid
scarlet
hue
leered
confidentially
upon
him
as
their
eyes
met
rising
also
but
with
less
precipitation
surveyed
the
intruder
languidly
and
with
a
certain
haughtiness
what
now
gazra
always
art
thou
like
a
worm
in
the
grass
crawling
on
thine
errand
with
less
noise
than
the
wind
makes
in
summer
i
would
thy
mistress
kept
a
fairer
messenger
the
black
smiled
if
so
hideous
a
contortion
of
his
repulsive
countenance
might
be
called
a
smile
and
slowly
raising
his
jetty
arms
hung
all
over
with
strings
of
coral
and
amber
made
a
curious
gesture
half
of
salutation
half
of
command
as
he
did
this
the
clear
olive
cheek
of
flushed
darkly
red
his
chest
heaved
and
linking
his
arm
through
that
of
theos
he
bent
his
head
slightly
and
stood
like
one
in
an
enforced
attitude
of
attention
then
gazra
spoke
his
harsh
strong
voice
seeming
to
come
from
some
devil
in
the
ground
rather
than
from
a
human
throat
the
virgin
priestess
of
the
sun
and
the
divine
nagaya
hath
need
of
thee
he
said
with
a
sort
of
suppressed
derision
underlying
his
words
and
taking
from
his
breast
a
ring
that
glittered
like
a
star
he
held
it
out
in
the
palm
of
one
hand
and
also
he
added
of
thy
friend
the
stranger
to
whom
she
desires
to
accord
a
welcome
behold
her
signet
theos
impelled
by
curiosity
would
have
taken
the
ring
up
to
examine
it
had
not
restrained
him
by
a
warning
pressure
of
his
arm
he
was
only
just
able
to
see
that
it
was
in
the
shape
of
a
serpent
with
ruby
eyes
and
a
darting
tongue
tipped
with
small
diamonds
what
chiefly
concerned
him
however
was
the
peculiar
change
in
demeanor
something
in
the
aspect
or
speech
of
gazra
had
surely
exercised
a
remarkable
influence
upon
him
his
frame
trembled
through
and
through
with
scarcely
controlled
excitement
his
eyes
shot
forth
an
almost
evil
fire
and
a
cold
calm
somewhat
cruel
smile
played
on
the
perfect
outline
of
his
delicate
month
taking
the
signet
from
gazra
palm
he
kissed
it
with
a
kind
of
angry
tenderness
then
tell
thy
mistress
we
shall
obey
her
behest
doubtless
she
knows
as
she
knows
all
things
that
i
am
summoned
by
express
command
to
the
palace
of
our
sovereign
lord
the
i
am
bound
thither
first
as
is
my
duty
but
afterwards
he
broke
off
as
if
he
found
it
impossible
to
say
more
and
waved
his
hand
in
a
light
sign
of
dismissal
but
gazra
did
not
at
once
depart
he
again
smiled
that
lowering
smile
of
his
which
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
hung
criminal
and
returned
the
jewelled
signet
to
his
breast
afterwards
afterwards
he
said
in
emphatic
yet
mock
solemn
even
so
advancing
a
little
he
laid
his
heavy
muscular
hand
on
theos
chest
and
appeared
mentally
to
measure
his
height
and
breadth
strong
nerves
iron
sinews
goodly
flesh
and
blood
serve
and
his
great
protruding
eyes
gleamed
maliciously
as
he
spoke
then
bowing
profoundly
he
added
addressing
both
and
noble
sirs
out
of
all
men
in
shall
you
be
the
most
envied
farewell
and
once
more
making
that
curious
salutation
which
had
in
it
so
much
imperiousness
and
so
little
obeisance
he
walked
backward
a
few
paces
in
the
full
lustre
of
the
set
sun
which
intensified
the
vivid
red
of
his
costume
and
lit
up
all
the
ornaments
of
amber
that
glittered
against
his
swarthy
skin
then
turning
he
descended
the
hillock
so
swiftly
that
he
seemed
to
have
melted
out
of
sight
as
utterly
as
a
dark
mist
dissolving
in
air
by
my
word
a
most
sooty
and
repellent
bearer
of
a
lady
greeting
laughed
theos
lightly
as
he
sauntered
arm
in
arm
with
his
host
on
the
downward
path
leading
to
the
garden
and
palace
and
i
have
yet
to
learn
the
true
meaning
of
his
message
is
plain
enough
replied
somewhat
sulkily
with
the
deep
flush
still
coming
and
going
on
his
face
it
means
that
we
are
summoned
thou
as
well
as
i
to
one
of
lysia
midnight
banquets
an
honor
that
falls
to
few
a
mandate
none
dare
disobey
she
must
have
spied
thee
out
this
morning
the
only
unkneeling
soul
in
all
the
abject
perhaps
her
present
desire
for
thy
company
there
was
a
touch
of
vexation
in
his
voice
but
theos
heeded
it
not
his
heart
gave
a
great
bound
against
his
ribs
as
though
pricked
by
a
arrow
something
swift
and
ardent
stirred
in
his
blood
like
the
flowing
of
quicksilver
the
picture
of
the
witchingly
beautiful
woman
he
had
seen
that
morning
in
her
ship
seemed
to
float
between
him
and
the
light
her
face
shone
out
like
a
growing
in
the
tangled
wilderness
of
his
thoughts
and
his
lips
trembled
a
little
as
he
replied
she
must
be
gracious
and
forgiving
then
even
as
she
is
fair
for
in
my
neglect
of
reverence
due
i
merited
her
scorn
not
her
courtesy

tell
me
how
could
she
know
i
was
a
guest
of
thine
glanced
at
him
half
disdainfully
how
could
she
know
easily
inasmuch
as
she
knows
all
things
have
been
strange
indeed
had
she
not
known
and
he
caught
at
a
rose
and
crushed
its
fragrant
head
in
his
hand
with
a
sort
of
wanton
petulance
the
king
himself
is
less
acquainted
with
his
people
doings
than
the
wearer
of
the
eye
thou
hast
not
yet
seen
that
weird
mirror
and
potent
dazzler
of
human
sight
no
but
thou
wilt
see
it
ere
long
the
glittering
of
the
whitest
breast
that
ever
shut
in
passion
his
voice
shook
and
he
paused
then
with
some
effort
continued
yes
lysia
has
her
secret
commissioners
everywhere
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
city
who
report
to
her
each
circumstance
that
happens
no
matter
how
trifling
and
doubtless
we
were
followed
home
tracked
step
by
step
as
we
walked
together
by
one
of
her
servitors
in
this
there
would
be
naught
unusual
then
there
is
no
freedom
in
said

wonderingly
if
the
whole
city
thus
lies
under
the
circumspection
of
a
woman
laughed
rather
harshly
freedom
by
the
gods
is
a
delusive
word
embodying
a
vain
idea
where
is
there
any
freedom
in
life
all
of
us
are
bound
in
chains
and
restricted
in
one
way
or
the
other
the
man
who
deems
himself
politically
free
is
a
slave
to
the
multitude
and
his
own
ambition
while
he
who
shakes
himself
loose
from
the
trammels
of
custom
and
creed
becomes
the
tortured
bondsman
of
desire
tied
fast
with
bruising
cords
to
the
rack
of
his
own
unbridled
sense
and
appetite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
freedom
my
friend
unless
haply
it
may
be
found
in
death
come
let
us
in
to
supper
the
hour
grows
late
and
my
heart
aches
with
an
unsought
heaviness
i
must
cheer
me
with
a
cup
of
wine
or
my
songs
will
sadden
rather
than
rouse
the
king
come
and
thou
shalt
speak
to
me
again
of
the
life
that
is
to
be
lived
hereafter
and
he
smiled
with
certain
pathos
in
his
smile
for
there
are
times
believe
me
when
in
spite
of
all
my
fame
and
the
sweetness
of
existence
i
weary
of
earth
days
and
nights
and
find
them
far
too
brief
and
mean
to
satisfy
my
longings
not
the

but
worlds

be
the

heritage
theos
looked
at
him
with
a
feeling
of
unutterable
yearning
affection
and
regret
but
said
nothing
and
together
they
ascended
the
steps
of
the
stately
marble
terrace
and
paced
slowly
across
it
keeping
as
near
to
each
other
as
shadow
to
substance
and
thus
reentered
the
palace
where
the
sound
of
a
distant
harp
alone
penetrated
the
perfumed
stillness
it

strange
and
plaintive

as
they
left
the
garden
the
night
fell
or
appeared
to
fall
with
almost
startling
suddenness
and
at
the
same
time
in
swift
defiance
of
the
darkness
palace
was
illuminated
from
end
to
end
by
thousands
of
colored
lamps
all
apparently
lit
at
once
by
a
single
flash
of
electricity
a
magnificent
repast
was
spread
for
the
laureate
and
his
guest
in
a
lofty
richly
frescoed
a
repast
voluptuous
enough
to
satisfy
the
most
ardent
votary
that
ever
followed
the
doctrines
of
epicurus
wonderful
dainties
and
still
more
wonderful
wines
were
served
in
princely
profusion
and
while
the
strangely
met
and
sympathetically
united
friends
ate
and
drank
delicious
music
was
played
on
stringed
instruments
by
unseen
performers
when
at
intervals
these
pleasing
sounds
ceased
conversation
brilliant
witty
refined
and
sparkling
with
light
anecdote
and
lighter
jest
replaced
with
admirable
sufficiency
the
harmonies
and
theos
keenly
alive
to
the
sensuous
enemy
of
his
own
emotions
felt
that
he
had
never
before
enjoyed
such
an
astonishing
delightful
and
altogether
feast
its
only
fault
was
that
it
came
to
an
end
too
soon
he
thought
when
the
last
course
of
fruit
and
sweet
comfits
being
removed
he
rose
reluctantly
from
the
glittering
board
and
prepared
to
accompany
his
host
as
agreed
to
the
presence
of
the
king
in
a
very
short
time
so
bewilderingly
short
as
to
seem
a
mere
he
found
himself
passing
through
the
broad
avenues
and
crowded
thoroughfares
of
on
his
way
to
the
royal
abode
he
occupied
a
place
in
chariot
a
gilded
car
shaped
somewhat
like
the
curved
half
of
a
shell
deeply
hollowed
and
set
on
two
high
wheels
that
as
they
rolled
made
scarcely
any
sound
there
was
no
seat
and
both
he
and
stood
erect
the
latter
using
all
the
force
of
his
slender
brown
hands
to
control
the
spirited
prancing
of
the
pair
of
steeds
which
harnessed
to
the
seemed
more
than
once
disposed
to
break
loose
into
furious
gallop
regardless
of
their
master
curbing
rein
the
full
moon
was
rising
gradually
in
a
sky
as
densely
violet
as
purple
but
her
mellow
lustre
was
almost
put
to
shame
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
streets
which
were
lit
up
on
both
sides
by
lamps
that
diffused
a
peculiar
intense
yet
soft
radiance
produced
as
explained
from
electricity
on
the
twelve
tall
towers
of
the
sacred
temple
shone
twelve
large
revolving
stars
that
as
they
turned
emitted
vivid
flashes
of
blue
green
and
amber
flame
like
signals
seen
from
ships
veering
shorewards
and
the
reflections
thus
cast
on
the
mosaic
pavement
mingling
with
the
paler
beams
of
the
moon
gave
a
weird
and
most
fantastic
effect
to
the
scene
straight
ahead
a
blazing
arch
raised
like
a
bent
bow
against
heaven
and
having
in
its
centre
the
word
zephoranim
written
in
scintillating
letters
of
fire
indicated
to
all
beholders
the
name
and
abode
of
the
powerful
monarch
under
whose
dominion
according
to
had
reached
its
present
height
of
wealth
and
prosperity
theos
looked
everywhere
about
him
seeing
yet
scarcely
realizing
the
wonders
on
which
he
gazed
leaning
one
arm
on
the
burnished
edge
of
the
car
he
glanced
now
and
then
up
at
the
dusky
skies
growing
thick
with
swarming
worlds
and
meditated
dreamily
whether
it
might
not
be
within
the
range
of
possibility
to
be
lifted
with
chariot
steeds
and
all
into
that
beautiful
fathomless
empyrean
and
drive
among
planets
as
though
they
were
flowers
reining
in
at
last
before
some
great
golden
gate
which
unbarred
should
open
into
a
lustrous
fairer
than
all
fair
regions
ever
pictured
how
like
a
god
looked
he
mused
his
eyes
resting
tenderly
on
the
light
glittering
form
he
was
never
weary
of
contemplating
could
there
be
a
more
perfect
head
than
that
dark
one
crowned
with
myrtle
could
there
be
a
more
dazzling
existence
than
that
enjoyed
by
this
child
of
happy
fortune
this
royal
laureate
of
a
mighty
king
how
many
poets
starving
in
garrets
and
waiting
for
a
hearing
would
not
curse
their
unlucky
destinies
when
comparing
themselves
with
such
a
prince
of
poesy
each
word
of
whose
utterance
was
treasured
and
enshrined
in
the
hearts
of
a
grateful
and
admiring
people
this
was
fame
indeed
fame
at
its
utmost
best
and
theos
sighed
once
or
twice
restlessly
as
he
inwardly
reflected
how
poor
and
unsatisfying
were
his
own
poetical
powers
and
how
totally
unfitted
he
was
to
cope
with
a
rival
so
vastly
his
superior
not
that
he
by
any
means
desired
to
cross
swords
with
in
a
duel
of
song
was
an
idea
that
never
entered
his
mind
he
was
simply
conscious
of
a
certain
humiliated
feeling
an
impression
that
it
he
would
be
a
poet
at
all
he
must
go
back
to
the
very
first
beginning
of
the
art
and
all
he
had
ever
known
or
thought
he
knew
many
strange
and
complex
emotions
were
at
work
within
him
emotions
which
he
could
neither
control
nor
analyze
and
though
he
felt
himself
fully
alive
alive
to
his
very
he
was
ever
and
anon
aware
of
a
curious
sensation
like
that
experienced
by
a
suddenly
startled
somnambulist
who
just
on
the
point
of
awaking
hesitates
reluctantly
on
the
threshold
of
dreamland
unwilling
to
leave
one
realm
of
shadows
for
another
more
seeming
true
yet
equally
transient
entangled
in
perplexed
reveries
he
scarcely
noticed
the
brilliant
crowds
of
people
that
were
flocking
hither
and
thither
through
the
streets
many
of
whom
recognizing
waved
their
hands
or
shouted
some
gay
word
of
greeting
he
saw
as
it
were
without
seeing
the
whirling
pageant
around
him
was
both
real
and
unreal
there
was
always
a
deep
sense
of
mystery
that
hung
like
a
cloud
over
his
mind
a
cloud
that
no
resolution
of
his
could
lift
and
often
he
caught
himself
dimly
speculating
as
to
what
lay
behind
that
cloud
something
he
felt
sure
something
that
like
the
clew
to
an
intricate
problem
would
explain
much
that
was
now
altogether
incomprehensible
moreover
he
remorsefully
realized
that
he
had
formerly
known
that
clew
and
had
foolishly
lost
it
but
how
he
could
not
tell
his
gaze
wandered
from
the
figure
of
to
that
of
the
attendant
who
perched
on
a
narrow
foothold
on
the
back
of
the
chariot
held
his
master
golden
instrument
aloft
as
though
it
were
a
flag
of
song
the
signal
of
a
poet
triumph
destined
to
float
above
the
world
forever
just
then
the
equipage
arrived
at
the
kings
palace
turning
the
horses
heads
with
a
sharp
jerk
so
that
the
mettlesome
creatures
almost
sprang
erect
on
their
haunches
drove
them
swiftly
into
a
spacious
courtyard
lined
with
soldiers
in
full
armor
and
brilliantly
illuminated
where
two
gigantic
stone
sphinxes
with
lit
stars
ablaze
between
their
enormous
brows
guarded
a
flight
of
steps
that
led
up
to
what
seemed
to
be
an
endless
avenue
of
white
marble
columns
here
slaves
in
gorgeous
attire
rushed
forward
and
seizing
the
prancing
coursers
by
the
bridle
rein
held
them
fast
while
the
laureate
and
his
companion
alighted
as
they
did
so
a
mighty
and
resounding
clash
of
weapons
struck
the
tesselated
pavement
every
soldier
flung
his
drawn
sword
on
the
ground
and
doffed
his
helmet
and
the
cry
of
hail
rose
in
one
brief
mellow
manly
shout
that
echoed
vibratingly
through
the
heated
air
meanwhile
ascended
up
the
steps
and
there
turning
round
smiled
and
bowed
with
an
exquisite
grace
and
infinite
condescension
and
again
theos
gazed
at
him
yearningly
lovingly
and
somewhat
enviously
too
what
a
picture
he
made
standing
between
the
great
frowning
sculptured
sphinxes
contrasted
with
those
cold
and
solemn
visages
of
stone
he
looked
like
a
dazzling
butterfly
or
stray
bird
of
paradise
his
white
garb
glistened
at
every
point
with
gems
and
from
his
shoulders
where
it
was
fastened
with
large
sapphire
elasps
depended
a
long
mantle
of
cloth
of
gold
bordered
thickly
with
swansdown
this
he
held
up
negligently
in
one
hand
as
ho
remained
for
a
moment
in
full
view
of
the
assembled
soldiery
graciously
acknowledging
their
enthusiastic
greetings
then
with
easy
and
unhasting
tread
he
mounted
the
rest
of
the
stairway
followed
by
theos
and
his
and
passed
into
the
immense
outer
entrance
hall
of
the
royal
palace
known
as
he
explained
to
his
guest
as
the
hall
of
the
two
thousand
columns
here
among
the
massively
carved
pillars
which
looked
like
straight
tall
frosted
trunks
of
trees
were
assembled
hundreds
of
men
young
and
old
evident
aristocrats
and
nobles
of
high
degree
to
judge
from
the
magnificence
of
their
costumes
while
in
and
out
their
brilliant
ranks
glided
little
pages
in
crimson
and
blue
black
slaves
or
clothed
in
vivid
colors
court
officials
with
jewelled
badges
and
insignias
of
authority
military
guards
clad
in
steel
armor
and
carrying
short
drawn
scimetars
all
talking
laughing
gesticulating
and
elbowing
one
another
as
they
moved
to
and
fro
and
so
thickly
were
they
pressed
together
that
at
first
sight
it
seemed
impossible
to
penetrate
through
so
dense
a
crowd
but
no
sooner
did
appear
than
they
all
fell
back
in
orderly
rows
thus
making
an
open
space
for
his
admittance
he
walked
slowly
with
mien
and
a
confident
smile
bowing
right
and
left
in
response
to
the
respectful
salutations
he
received
from
all
assembled
many
persons
glanced
inquisitively
at
theos
but
as
he
was
the
laureate
companion
he
was
saluted
with
nearly
equal
courtesy
the
old
critic
zabastes
squeezing
his
lean
bent
body
from
out
the
throng
hobbled
after
at
some
little
distance
behind
the
muttering
to
himself
as
he
went
and
bestowing
many
a
and
malicious
grin
on
those
among
his
acquaintance
whom
he
here
and
there
recognized
theos
noted
his
behavior
with
a
vague
sense
of
amusement
the
man
took
such
evident
delight
in
his
own
and
seemed
to
be
so
thoroughly
convinced
that
his
opinion
on
all
affairs
was
the
only
one
worth
having
thou
must
check
thy
tongue
today
zabastes
said
a
handsome
youth
in
dazzling
blue
and
silver
who
just
then
detaching
himself
from
the
crowd
laid
a
hand
on
the
critic
arm
and
laughed
as
he
spoke
i
doubt
me
much
whether
the
king
is
in
humor
for
thy
grim
fooling
his
majesty
hath
been
seriously
discomposed
since
his
return
from
the
royal
this
morning
notwithstanding
that
his
unerring
spear
slew
two
goodly
and
most
furious
animals
he
is
wondrous
sullen
only
the
divine
is
skilled
in
the
art
of
soothing
his
troubled
spirit
therefore
if
thou
hast
aught
of
crabbed
or
cantankerous
to
urge
against
thy
master
genius
thou
hadst
best
reserve
it
for
another
time
lest
thy
withered
head
roll
on
the
with
as
little
reverence
as
a
dried
gourd
flung
from
a
fruiterer
stall
i
thank
thee
for
thy
warning
young
jackanapes
retorted
zabastes
pausing
in
his
walk
and
leaning
on
his
staff
while
he
peered
with
his
small
black
eyes
at
the
thou
art
methinks
somewhat
over
for
a
little
lacquey
what
knowest
thou
of
his
majesty
humors
hast
been
his
or
i
pray
thee
extend
not
thy
range
of
learning
beyond
the
proper
temperature
of
the
bath
and
the
choice
of
rare
unguents
for
thy
knowledge
than
this
would
injure
the
tender
texture
of
thy
fragile
brain
pah
and
zabastes
sniffed
the
air
in
disgust
thou
hast
a
most
vile
odor
of
jessamine
about
thee
i
would
thou
wert
clean
of
perfumes
and
less
tawdry
in
attire
chuckling
hoarsely
he
ambled
onward
and
chancing
to
catch
the
wondering
backward
glance
of
pheos
he
made
expressive
signs
with
his
fingers
in
derision
of
sweeping
mantle
which
now
allowed
to
fall
to
its
full
length
trailed
along
the
marble
floor
with
a
rich
rustling
sound
the
varied
light
sparkling
on
it
at
every
point
and
making
it
look
like
a
veritable
shower
of
gold
on
through
the
seemingly
endless
colonnades
they
passed
till
they
came
to
a
huge
double
door
formed
of
two
glittering
colossed
winged
figures
holding
enormous
uplifted
shields
here
stood
a
personage
clad
in
a
silver
so
motionless
that
at
first
he
appeared
to
be
part
of
the
door
but
at
the
approach
of
he
stirred
into
life
and
action
and
touching
a
spring
beside
him
the
arms
of
the
twin
colossi
moved
the
great
double
shields
were
slowly
lowered
and
the
portals
slid
asunder
noiselessly
thus
displaying
the
sumptuous
splendor
of
the
royal
it
was
a
spacious
and
lofty
saloon
completely
lined
with
gilded
columns
between
which
hung
numerous
golden
lamps
having
long
pointed
amber
pendants
that
flashed
down
a
million
sparkles
as
of
sunlight
on
the
magnificent
mosaic
floor
beneath
on
the
walls
were
rich
tapestries
storied
with
voluptuous
scenes
of
love
as
well
as
ghastly
glimpses
of
warfare
and
languishing
beauties
reposing
in
the
arms
of
their
lovers
or
listening
to
the
songs
of
passion
were
depicted
side
by
side
with
warriors
dead
on
the
field
of
battle
or
struggling
hand
to
hand
in
grim
and
bleeding
conflict
the
corners
of
this
wonderful
apartment
were
decked
with
all
sorts
of
flags
and
weapons
and
in
the
middle
of
the
painted
ceiling
was
suspended
a
huge
bird
with
the
spread
wings
of
an
eagle
and
the
head
of
an
owl
that
held
in
its
curved
talons
a
superb
girandole
formed
of
a
hundred
extended
swords
each
bare
blade
having
at
its
point
a
bright
lamp
in
the
shape
of
a
star
while
the
clustered
hilts
composed
the
centre
officers
in
full
uniform
were
ranged
on
both
sides
of
the
room
and
a
number
of
other
men
richly
attired
stood
about
conversing
with
each
other
in
low
tones
but
though
theos
took
in
all
these
details
rapidly
at
a
glance
his
gaze
soon
became
fixed
on
the
glittering
pavilion
that
occupied
the
furthest
end
of
the
saloon
where
on
a
massive
throne
of
ivory
and
silver
sat
the
chief
object
of
attraction
zephoranim
the
king
the
steps
of
the
royal
dais
were
strewn
with
flowers
on
either
hand
a
bronze
lion
lay
couchant
and
four
gigantic
black
statues
of
men
supported
the
monarch
canopy
their
uplifted
arms
being
decked
with
innumerable
rows
of
large
and
small
pearls
the
king
features
were
not
just
then
visible
he
was
leaning
back
in
an
indolent
attitude
resting
on
his
elbow
and
half
covering
his
face
with
one
hand
the
individual
in
the
silver
whispered
something
in
ear
either
by
way
of
warning
or
advice
and
then
advanced
prostrating
himself
before
the
dais
and
touching
the
ground
humbly
with
his
forehead
and
hands
the
king
stirred
slightly
but
did
not
alter
his
position
he
was
evidently
wrapped
in
a
deep
and
seemingly
unpleasant
reverie
dread
my
lord
began
the
a
movement
of
decided
impatience
on
the
part
of
the
monarch
caused
him
to
stop
short
by
my
soul
said
a
rich
strong
voice
that
made
itself
distinctly
audible
throughout
the
spacious
hall
thou
art
ever
shivering
on
the
edge
of
thy
duty
when
thou
shouldst
plunge
boldly
into
the
midst
thereof
how
long
wilt
mouth
thy
words
canst
never
speak
plain
most
potent
sovereign
went
on
the
stammering
herald
waits
thy
royal
pleasure
and
the
monarch
sprang
erect
his
eyes
flashing
fire
nay
that
he
should
wait
bodes
ill
for
thee
thou
knave
how
darest
thou
bid
him
wait
entreat
him
hither
with
all
gentleness
as
befits
mine
equal
in
the
realm
as
he
thus
spoke
theos
was
able
to
observe
him
more
attentively
indeed
it
seemed
as
though
a
sudden
and
impressive
pause
had
occurred
in
the
action
of
a
drama
in
order
to
allow
him
as
spectator
to
thoroughly
master
the
meaning
of
one
special
scene
therefore
he
took
the
opportunity
offered
and
looking
full
at
zephoranim
thought
he
had
never
beheld
so
magnificent
a
man
of
stately
height
and
herculean
build
he
was
most
truly
royal
in
outward
bearing
though
a
physiognomist
judging
him
from
the
expression
of
his
countenance
would
at
once
have
given
him
all
the
worst
vices
of
a
reckless
voluptuary
and
utterly
selfish
sensualist
his
straight
low
brows
indicated
brute
force
rather
than
intellect
his
eyes
full
dark
and
brilliant
had
in
them
a
suggestion
of
something
sinister
and
cruel
despite
their
fine
clearness
and
lustre
while
the
heavy
lines
of
his
mouth
only
partly
concealed
by
a
short
thick
black
beard
plainly
betokened
that
the
monarch
tendencies
were
by
no
means
toward
the
strict
and
narrow
paths
of
virtue
nevertheless
he
was
a
splendid
specimen
of
the
human
animal
at
its
best
physical
development
and
his
attire
which
was
a
mixture
of
the
civilized
and
savage
suited
him
as
it
certainly
would
not
have
suited
any
less
stalwart
frame
his
tunic
was
of
the
deepest
purple
broidered
with
gold
his
vest
of
pale
amber
silk
was
thrown
open
so
as
to
display
to
the
greatest
advantage
his
broad
muscular
chest
and
throat
glittering
all
over
with
gems
and
he
wore
flung
loosely
across
his
left
shoulder
a
superb
leopard
skin
just
kept
in
place
by
a
clasp
of
diamonds
his
feet
were
shod
with
sandals
his
arms
were
bare
and
lavishly
decked
with
jewelled
armlets
his
rough
dark
hair
was
tossed
carelessly
about
his
brow
whereon
a
circlet
of
gold
studded
with
large
rubies
glittered
in
the
light
from
his
belt
hung
a
great
sheathed
sword
together
with
all
manner
of
hunting
implements
and
beside
him
on
a
stand
lay
a
short
sceptre
having
at
its
tip
one
huge
pearl
set
in
sapphires
noting
the
grand
poise
of
his
figure
and
the
statuesque
grace
of
his
attitude
a
strange
hazy
memory
began
to
urge
itself
on
theos
mind
a
memory
that
with
every
second
grew
more
painfully
distinct
he
had
seen
zephoranim
before
where
he
could
not
tell
but
he
was
as
positive
of
it
as
that
he
himself
lived
and
this
inward
conviction
was
accompanied
by
a
certain
undefinable
dread
a
vague
terror
and
foreboding
though
he
knew
no
actual
cause
for
fear
he
had
however
no
time
to
analyze
his
emotion
for
just
then
the
having
performed
a
backward
evolution
from
the
throne
to
the
threshold
of
the
beckoned
impatiently
to
who
at
once
stepped
forward
bidding
theos
keep
close
behind
him
the
followed
and
thus
all
three
approached
the
dais
where
the
king
still
stood
erect
awaiting
them
zabastes
the
critic
glided
in
also
almost
unnoticed
and
joined
a
group
of
courtiers
at
the
furthest
end
of
the
long
gorgeously
lighted
room
while
at
sight
of
the
laureate
the
assembled
officers
saluted
and
all
conversation
ceased
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
paused
but
made
no
obeisance
raising
his
glorious
eyes
to
the
monarch
face
he
smiled
and
theos
beheld
with
amazement
that
here
it
was
not
the
poet
who
reverenced
the
king
but
the
king
who
reverenced
the
poet
what
a
strange
state
of
things
he
thought
especially
when
the
mighty
zephoranim
actually
descended
three
steps
of
his
dais
and
grasping
hands
raised
them
to
his
lips
with
all
the
humility
of
a
splendid
savage
paying
homage
to
his
intellectual
conqueror
it
was
a
scene
theos
was
destined
never
to
forget
and
he
gazed
upon
it
as
one
gazes
on
a
magnificently
painted
picture
wherein
two
central
figures
fascinate
and
most
profoundly
impress
the
beholder
imagination
he
heard
with
a
vague
sense
of
mingled
pleasure
and
sadness
the
deep
mellow
tones
of
the
monarch
voice
vibrating
through
the
silence
welcome
my
welcome
at
all
times
but
chiefly
welcome
when
the
heart
is
weighted
by
care
i
have
thought
of
thee
all
day
believe
me
aye
since
early
dawn
when
on
my
way
to
the
chase
i
heard
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
a
happy
nightingale
singing
and
deemed
thy
voice
had
taken
and
followed
me
and
that
i
sent
for
thee
in
haste
blame
me
not
as
well
blame
the
desert
athirst
for
rain
or
the
hungry
heart
agape
for
love
to
come
and
fill
it
here
his
restless
eye
flashed
on
theos
who
stood
quietly
behind
passive
yet
expectant
of
he
knew
not
what
whom
hast
thou
there
a
friend
this
as
apparently
explained
something
in
a
low
tone
he
is
welcome
also
for
thy
sake
and
he
extended
one
hand
on
which
a
great
ruby
signet
burned
like
a
red
star
to
theos
who
bending
over
it
kissed
it
with
the
grave
courtesy
he
fancied
due
to
kings
zephoranim
appeared
surprised
at
this
action
and
eyed
him
somewhat
scrutinizingly
as
he
said
thou
art
not
of
divine
calling
assuredly
fair
sir
else
thou
wouldst
hardly
stoop
to
a
mere
crowned
head
like
mine
soldiers
and
statesmen
may
bend
the
knee
to
their
chosen
rulers
but
to
whom
shall
poets
bend
they
who
with
arrowy
lines
cause
thrones
to
totter
and
fall
they
who
with
deathless
utterance
brand
with
infamy
or
hallow
with
honor
the
most
potent
names
of
kings
and
emperors
they
by
whom
alone
a
nation
lives
in
the
annals
of
the
future
what
homage
do
such
elect
gods
owe
to
the
passing
holders
of
one
or
more
earthly
sceptres
thou
art
too
humble
methinks
for
the
dost
call
thyself
a
minstrel
or
a
student
of
the
art
of
song
theos
looked
up
his
eyes
resting
full
on
the
monarch
countenance
as
he
replied
in
low
clear
tones
most
noble
zephoranim
i
am
no
minstrel
nor
do
i
deserve
to
be
called
even
a
student
of
that
high
sweet
in
which
alone
excels
all
i
dare
hope
for
is
that
i
may
learn
of
him
in
some
small
degree
the
lessons
he
has
mastered
that
at
some
future
time
i
may
approach
as
nearly
to
his
genius
as
a
common
flower
on
earth
can
approach
to
a
fixed
star
in
the
furthest
blue
of
heaven
smiled
and
gave
him
a
pleased
appreciative
glance
zephoranim
regarded
him
somewhat
curiously
by
my
faith
a
modest
and
gentle
disciple
of
poesy
he
said
we
receive
thee
gladly
to
our
court
as
suits
pleasure
and
our
own
stand
thee
near
thy
friend
and
master
and
listen
to
the
melody
of
his
matchless
voice
thou
shalt
hear
therein
the
mysteries
of
many
things
unravelled
and
chiefly
the
mystery
of
love
in
which
all
other
passions
centre
and
have
power
the
steps
of
the
dais
he
flung
himself
indolently
back
in
his
throne
whereupon
two
pages
brought
a
magnificent
chair
of
inlaid
ivory
and
placed
it
near
the
foot
of
the
dais
at
his
right
hand
in
this
seated
himself
the
pages
arranging
his
golden
mantle
around
him
in
shining
picturesque
folds
while
theos
withdrawing
slightly
into
the
background
stood
leaning
against
a
piece
of
tapestry
on
which
the
dead
figure
of
a
man
was
depicted
lying
prone
on
the
sward
with
a
great
wound
in
his
heart
and
a
bird
of
prey
hovering
above
him
expectant
of
its
grim
repast
kneeling
on
one
knee
close
to
the
put
the
harp
in
tune
and
swept
his
fingers
lightly
over
the
strings
then
came
a
pause
a
clear
small
bell
chimed
sweetly
on
the
stillness
and
the
king
raising
himself
a
little
signed
to
a
black
slave
who
carried
a
tall
silver
wand
emblematic
of
some
office
let
the
women
enter
he
commanded
speak
but
name
and
they
will
gather
like
waves
rising
to
the
moon
but
bid
them
be
silent
as
they
come
lest
they
disturb
thoughts
more
lasting
than
their
loveliness
this
with
a
significant
glance
toward
the
laureate
who
sunk
in
his
ivory
chair
seemed
rapt
in
meditation
his
beautiful
face
had
grown
grave
even
sad
he
played
idly
with
the
ornaments
at
his
belt
and
his
eyes
had
a
drowsy
yet
ardent
light
within
them
as
they
flashed
now
and
then
from
under
the
shade
of
his
long
curling
lashes
the
slave
departed
on
his
errand
and
zabastes
edging
himself
out
from
the
hushed
and
attentive
throng
of
nobles
stood
as
it
were
in
the
foreground
of
the
picture
his
thin
lips
twisted
into
a
sneer
and
his
lean
hands
grasping
his
staff
viciously
as
though
he
longed
to
strike
somebody
down
with
it
a
moment
or
so
passed
and
then
the
slave
returned
his
silver
rod
uplifted
marshalling
in
a
lovely
double
procession
of
female
figures
that
came
gliding
along
as
noiselessly
as
fair
ghosts
from
forgotten
tombs
each
one
carrying
a
garland
of
flowers
they
floated
rather
than
walked
up
to
the
royal
dais
and
there
prostrated
themselves
two
by
two
before
the
king
whose
fiery
glance
rested
upon
them
more
carelessly
than
tenderly
and
as
they
rose
they
threw
back
their
veils
displaying
to
full
view
such
exquisite
faces
such
languishing
brilliant
eyes
such
necks
and
arms
such
graceful
voluptuous
forms
that
theos
caught
at
the
tapestry
near
him
in
reeling
dazzlement
of
sight
and
sense
and
wondered
how
seated
tranquilly
in
the
reflective
attitude
he
had
assumed
could
maintain
so
unmoved
and
indifferent
a
demeanor
indifferent
he
was
however
even
when
the
unveiled
fair
ones
turning
from
the
king
to
the
poet
laid
all
their
garlands
at
his
feet
he
scarcely
noticed
the
flowers
and
still
less
the
lovely
donors
who
retiring
modestly
backwards
took
their
places
on
low
silken
divans
provided
for
their
accommodation
in
a
semicircle
round
the
throne
again
a
silence
ensued
was
evidently
centred
like
a
spider
in
a
web
of
his
own
and
his
attendant
gently
swept
the
strings
of
the
harp
again
to
recall
his
wandering
fancies
suddenly
he
looked
up
his
eyes
were
sombre
and
a
musing
trouble
shadowed
the
brightness
of
his
face
strange
it
is
o
king
he
said
in
low
suppressed
tones
that
had
in
them
a
quiver
of
pathetic
sweetness
strange
it
is
that
the
soul
of
my
singing
dwells
on
sorrow
like
a
stray
bird
flying
falling
leaves
or
a
ship
drifting
out
from
sunlight
to
storm
so
does
my
fancy
soar
among
drear
flitting
images
evolved
from
the
downfall
of
kingdoms
and
i
seem
to
behold
in
the
distance
the
shadow
of
death
talk
not
of
death
interrupted
the
king
loudly
and
in
haste
is
a
raven
note
that
hath
been
croaked
in
mine
ears
too
often
and
too
harshly
already
what
hast
thou
been
met
by
the
mad
khosrul
who
lately
sprang
on
me
even
as
a
famished
wolf
on
prey
and
grasping
my
bade
me
prepare
to
die
was
an
ill
jest
and
one
not
to
be
lightly
forgiven
to
die
o
zephoranim
he
cried
thy
time
of
reckoning
is
come
by
my
soul
and
the
monarch
broke
into
a
boisterous
laugh
had
he
bade
me
prepare
live
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
but
yon
frantic
graybeard
prates
of
naught
but
death
well
he
should
be
silenced
and
as
he
spoke
he
frowned
his
hand
involuntarily
playing
with
the
jewelled
hilt
of
his
sword
aye
death
is
an
unpleasing
suggestion
suddenly
said
zabastes
who
had
gradually
moved
up
nearer
and
nearer
till
he
made
one
of
the
group
immediately
round
is
a
word
that
should
never
be
mentioned
in
the
presence
of
kings
yet
notwithstanding
the
incivility
of
the
statement
it
is
most
certain
that
his
most
potent
majesty
as
well
as
his
majesty
most
potent
laureate
and
he
accompanied
the
words
with
two
decisive
taps
of
his
staff
smacking
his
withered
lips
meanwhile
as
though
he
tasted
something
peculiarly
savory
and
thou
also
zabastes
retorted
the
king
with
a
dark
smile
jestingly
drawing
his
sword
and
pointing
it
full
at
him
then
as
the
old
critic
shrank
slightly
at
the
gleam
of
the
bare
steel
replacing
it
dashingly
in
its
sheath
thou
also
and
thine
ashes
shall
be
cast
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
as
suits
thy
vocation
while
those
of
thy
master
and
thy
master
king
lie
honorably
urned
in
porphyry
and
gold
zabastes
bowed
with
a
sort
of
mock
humility
it
may
be
so
most
mighty
zephoranim
he
returned
composedly
nevertheless
ashes
are
always
ashes
and
the
scattering
of
them
is
but
a
question
of
time
for
urns
of
gold
and
porphyry
do
but
excite
the
cupidity
of
the
and
the
ashes
therein
sealed
whether
of
king
or
poet
stand
as
little
chance
of
reverent
handling
by
future
generations
as
those
of
many
lesser
men
and
is
doubtful
whether
the
winds
will
know
any
difference
in
the
scent
or
quality
of
the
various
pinches
of
human
dust
tossed
on
their
sweeping
circles
for
the
substance
of
a
man
reduced
to
is
always
the
same
and
not
a
grain
of
him
can
prove
whether
he
was
once
a
monarch
crowned
a
minstrel
pampered
or
a
critic
contemned
and
he
chuckled
as
one
having
the
best
of
the
argument
the
king
deigned
no
answer
but
turned
his
eyes
again
on
who
still
sat
pensively
silent
how
long
wilt
thou
be
mute
my
he
demanded
gently
canst
thou
not
improvise
a
canticle
of
love
even
in
the
midst
of
thy
soul
sudden
sadness
at
this
roused
himself
signing
to
his
attendant
he
took
the
harp
from
him
and
resting
it
lightly
on
one
knee
passed
his
hands
over
it
once
or
twice
half
musingly
half
doubtfully
a
ripple
of
music
answered
his
delicate
touch
music
as
soft
as
the
evening
wind
murmuring
among
willows
another
instant
and
his
voice
thrilled
on
the
silence
a
voice
wonderful
mellow
and
luscious
as
with
suppressed
tears
containing
within
it
a
passion
that
pierced
to
the
heart
of
the
listener
and
a
divine
fullness
such
as
surely
was
never
before
heard
in
human
tones
theos
leaned
forward
breathlessly
his
pulses
beating
with
unwonted
rapidity
what
was
it
that
sang
a
in
those
caressing
which
composed
the
language
of
a
burning
as
strong
wine
tender
as
the
murmur
of
the
sea
on
mellow
evenings
an
arrowy
shaft
of
rhyme
tipped
with
fire
and
meant
to
strike
home
to
the
core
of
feeling
and
there
inflict
delicious
wounds
but
as
each
word
echoed
harmoniously
on
his
ears
theos
shrank
back
shuddering
in
every
limb
a
black
frozen
numbness
seemed
to
pervade
his
being
an
awful
maddening
terror
possessed
his
brain
and
he
felt
as
though
he
were
suddenly
thrown
into
a
vast
dark
chaos
where
no
light
should
ever
shine
for
song
was
his
song
his
own
his
very
own
he
knew
it
well
he
had
written
it
long
ago
in
the
of
his
youth
when
he
had
fancied
all
the
world
was
waiting
to
be
set
to
the
music
of
his
inspiration
he
recognized
every
fancy
every
every
rhyme
the
delicate
glowing
ballad
was
his
his
alone
and
had
no
right
to
it
he
theos
was
the
poet
not
this
royally
favored
laureate
who
had
stolen
his
deas
and
filched
his
jewels
of
thought
aye
and
he
would
tell
him
so
to
his
face
he
would
speak
he
would
cry
aloud
his
claims
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
demand
instant
justice
he
strove
for
utterance
his
voice
was
gone
his
lips
were
moveless
as
the
lips
of
a
stone
image
stricken
absolutely
mute
but
with
his
sense
of
hearing
quickened
to
an
almost
painful
acuteness
he
stood
erect
and
motionless
rage
and
fear
contending
in
his
heart
enduring
the
torture
of
a
truly
terrific
mystery
of
forced
in
spite
of
himself
to
listen
passively
to
the
of
his
own
dead
past
revived
anew
in
his
rival
singing
chapter
xvi
the
prophet
of
doom
a
few
slow
dreadful
minutes
elapsed
and
then
then
the
first
sharpness
of
his
strange
mental
agony
subsided
the
strained
tension
of
his
nerves
gave
way
and
a
dull
apathy
of
grief
inconsolable
settled
upon
him
he
felt
himself
to
be
a
man
mysteriously
accurst
banished
as
it
were
out
of
life
and
stripped
of
all
he
had
once
held
dear
and
valuable
how
had
it
happened
why
was
he
set
apart
thus
solitary
poor
and
empty
of
all
worth
while
another
reaped
the
fruits
of
his
genius
he
heard
the
loud
plaudits
of
the
assembled
court
shaking
the
vast
hall
as
the
laureate
ended
his
song
and
drooping
his
head
some
stinging
tears
welled
up
in
his
eyes
and
fell
scorchingly
on
his
clasped
hands
tears
wrung
from
the
very
depth
of
his
secretly
tortured
soul
at
that
moment
the
beautiful
turned
toward
him
smiling
as
one
who
looked
for
more
sympathetic
approbation
than
that
offered
by
a
mixed
throng
and
meeting
that
happy
bland
gaze
he
strove
his
best
to
return
the
smile
just
then
zephoranim
fiery
glance
swept
over
him
with
a
curious
expression
of
wonder
and
commiseration
by
the
gods
yon
stranger
weeps
said
the
monarch
in
a
tone
then
with
more
gentleness
he
yet
is
not
the
first
time
voice
hath
unsealed
a
fountain
of
tears
no
greater
triumph
can
minstrel
have
than
this
to
move
the
strong
man
heart
to
woman
tenderness
we
have
heard
tell
of
poets
who
singing
of
death
have
persuaded
many
straightway
to
die
but
when
they
sing
of
sweeter
themes
of
lover
vows
of
and
languorous
desires
cold
is
the
blood
that
will
not
warm
and
thrill
to
their
divinely
eloquent
allurements
come
hither
fair
sir
and
he
beckoned
to
theos
who
mechanically
advanced
in
obedience
to
the
command
thou
hast
thoughts
of
thine
own
doubtless
concerning
love
and
love
fervor
of
delight
hast
aught
new
to
tell
us
of
its
bewildering
spells
whereby
the
most
dauntless
heroes
in
every
age
have
been
caught
conquered
and
bound
by
no
stronger
chain
than
a
tress
of
hair
or
a
kiss
more
luscious
than
all
the
honey
hidden
in
theos
looked
up
dreamily
his
eyes
wandered
from
the
king
to
as
though
in
wistful
search
for
some
missing
thing
his
lips
were
parched
and
burning
and
his
brows
ached
with
a
heavy
weight
of
pain
but
he
made
an
effort
to
speak
and
succeeded
though
his
words
came
slowly
and
without
any
previous
reflection
on
his
own
part
alas
most
potent
sovereign
he
i
am
a
man
of
sad
memories
whose
soul
is
like
the
desert
barren
of
all
beauty
i
may
have
sung
of
love
in
my
time
but
my
songs
were
never
new
never
worthy
to
last
one
little
hour
and
whatsoever
of
faith
passion
or
my
fancy
could
with
devious
dreams
devise
knows
and
in
song
all
my
best
thoughts
are
said
there
was
a
ring
of
intense
pathos
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
and
the
king
eyed
him
compassionately
of
a
truth
thou
seemest
to
have
suffered
he
observed
in
gentle
thou
hast
a
look
as
of
one
bereft
of
joy
hast
lost
some
maiden
love
of
thine
and
dost
thou
mourn
her
still
a
pang
bitter
as
death
shot
through
theos
heart
had
the
monarch
suddenly
pierced
him
with
his
great
sword
he
could
scarcely
have
endured
more
anguish
for
the
knowledge
rushed
upon
him
that
he
had
indeed
lost
a
love
so
faithful
so
unfathomable
so
pure
and
perfect
that
all
the
world
weighed
in
the
balance
against
it
would
have
seemed
but
a
grain
of
dust
compared
to
its
inestimable
value
but
what
that
love
was
and
from
whom
it
emanated
he
could
no
more
tell
than
the
tide
can
tell
in
syllabled
language
the
secret
of
its
attraction
to
the
moon
therefore
he
made
no
answer
only
a
deep
sigh
broke
from
him
and
zephoranim
apparently
touched
by
his
dejection
continued
nay
nay
we
will
not
seek
to
pry
into
the
cause
of
thy
heaviness
enough
think
no
more
of
our
thoughtless
question
there
is
a
sacredness
in
sorrow
nevertheless
we
shall
strive
to
make
thee
in
part
forget
thy
grief
ere
thou
leavest
our
court
and
city
meanwhile
sit
thou
there
and
he
pointed
to
the
lower
step
of
the
dais
and
thou
sing
again
and
this
time
let
thy
song
he
set
to
a
less
plaintive
key
he
leaned
hack
in
his
throne
and
theos
sat
wearily
down
among
the
flowers
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
as
commanded
he
was
possessed
by
a
strange
inward
dread
the
dread
of
altogether
losing
the
consciousness
of
his
own
identity
and
while
he
strove
to
keep
a
firm
grasp
on
his
mental
faculties
he
at
the
same
time
abandoned
all
hope
of
ever
extricating
himself
from
the
perplexing
enigma
in
which
he
was
so
darkly
involved
forcing
himself
by
degrees
into
comparative
calmness
he
determined
to
resign
himself
to
his
fate
and
the
idea
he
had
just
had
of
boldly
claiming
the
ballad
sung
by
as
his
own
completely
passed
out
of
his
mind
how
could
he
speak
against
this
friend
whom
he
loved
more
than
he
had
ever
loved
any
living
thing
besides
what
could
he
prove
to
begin
with
in
his
present
condition
ho
could
give
no
satisfactory
account
of
himself
if
he
were
asked
questions
concerning
his
nation
or
he
could
not
answer
them
he
did
not
even
know
where
he
had
come
from
save
that
his
memory
persistently
furnished
him
with
the
name
of
a
place
called
ardath
but
what
was
this
ardath
to
him
he
mused
what
did
it
signify
what
had
it
to
do
with
his
immediate
position
nothing
so
far
as
he
could
tell
his
intellect
seemed
to
be
divided
into
two
parts
one
a
total
blank
the
other
filled
with
crowding
images
that
while
novel
were
yet
curiously
familiar
and
how
could
he
accuse
of
literary
theft
when
he
had
none
of
his
own
dated
manuscripts
to
bear
out
his
case
of
course
he
could
easily
repeat
his
boyhood
verses
word
for
word
but
what
of
that
he
a
stranger
in
the
city
befriended
and
protected
by
the
laureate
would
certainly
be
considered
by
the
people
of
as
far
more
likely
to
steal
thoughts
than
that
should
steal
his
no
there
was
no
help
for
it
as
matters
stood
he
could
say
nothing
he
could
only
feel
as
though
he
were
the
sorrowful
ghost
of
some
dead
author
returned
to
earth
to
hear
others
claiming
his
works
and
passing
them
off
as
original
compositions
and
thus
he
was
scarcely
moved
to
any
fresh
surprise
when
giving
back
the
harp
to
his
attendant
rose
up
and
standing
erect
in
an
attitude
unequalled
for
grace
and
dignity
began
to
recite
a
poem
he
remembered
to
have
written
when
he
was
about
twenty
years
of
age
a
poem
daringly
planned
which
when
published
had
aroused
the
bitterest
animosity
of
the
press
critics
on
account
of
what
they
called
its
forced
sublimity
the
sublimity
was
by
no
means
forced
it
was
the
spontaneous
outcome
of
a
fresh
and
ardent
nature
full
of
enthusiasm
and
aspiration
but
the
critics
cared
nothing
for
this
all
they
saw
was
a
young
man
presuming
to
be
original
and
down
they
came
upon
him
accordingly
he
recollected
all
the
sufferings
he
had
endured
through
that
and
cruelly
condemned
composition
and
now
he
was
listlessly
amazed
at
the
breathless
rapture
and
excitement
it
evoked
here
in
this
marvellous
city
of
where
everything
seemed
more
strange
and
weird
than
the
strangest
dream
it
was
a
story
of
the
gods
before
the
world
was
made
of
love
deep
buried
in
far
eternities
of
light
of
vast
celestial
shapes
whose
wanderings
through
the
blue
deep
of
space
were
tracked
by
the
birth
of
stars
and
suns
and
of
beauty
a
fanciful
legend
of
transcendent
heavenly
passion
telling
how
all
created
worlds
throbbed
amorously
in
the
purple
seas
of
pure
ether
and
how
love
and
love
alone
was
the
dominant
cloud
of
the
triumphal
march
of
the
universe
and
with
what
matchless
eloquence
spoke
the
glowing
lines
what
clear
and
rounded
tenderness
of
accent
how
exquisitely
his
voice
rose
and
fell
in
a
rhythmic
rush
like
the
wind
surging
through
many
leaves
while
ever
and
anon
in
the
very
midst
of
the
divinely
entrancing
joy
that
chiefly
characterized
the
poem
his
musicianly
art
infused
a
touch
of
minor
pathos
a
suggestion
of
the
eternal
complaint
of
nature
which
even
in
the
happiest
moments
asserts
itself
in
mournful
the
effect
of
his
splendid
declamation
was
heightened
by
a
few
soft
running
passages
dexterously
played
on
the
harp
by
his
attendant
harpist
and
introduced
just
at
the
right
moments
and
theos
notwithstanding
the
peculiar
position
in
which
he
was
placed
listened
to
every
word
of
his
own
work
thus
recited
with
a
gradually
deepening
sense
of
peace
he
knew
not
why
for
the
verses
in
themselves
were
strangely
passionate
and
wild
the
various
impressions
produced
on
the
hearers
were
curious
to
witness
the
king
moved
restlessly
his
bronzed
cheeks
alternately
flushing
and
paling
his
hand
now
grasping
his
sword
now
toying
with
the
innumerable
jewels
that
blazed
on
his
breast
the
women
eyes
at
one
moment
sparkled
with
delight
and
at
the
next
grew
humid
with
tears
the
assembled
courtiers
pressed
forward
awed
eager
and
attentive
the
very
soldiers
on
guard
seemed
entranced
and
not
even
a
small
disturbed
the
harmonious
fall
and
flow
of
dulcet
speech
that
rippled
from
the
laureate
lips
when
he
ceased
there
broke
forth
such
a
tremendous
uproar
of
applause
that
the
amber
pendents
of
the
lamps
swung
to
and
fro
in
the
strong
vibration
of
so
many
uplifted
voices
shouts
of
frenzied
rapture
echoed
again
and
again
through
the
vaulted
roof
like
thuds
of
thunder
shouts
in
which
theos
joined
as
why
should
he
not
he
had
as
good
a
right
as
any
one
to
applaud
his
own
poem
it
had
been
sufficiently
abused
heretofore
he
was
glad
to
find
it
now
so
well
appreciated
at
least
in
though
he
had
no
intention
of
putting
forward
any
claim
to
its
authorship
no
for
it
was
evident
he
had
in
some
inscrutable
way
been
made
an
outcast
from
all
literary
honor
and
a
sort
of
wild
recklessness
grew
up
within
him
a
bitter
mirth
arising
from
curiously
mingled
feelings
of
scorn
for
himself
and
tenderness
for
and
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
he
loudly
cheered
the
triumphant
robber
of
his
stores
of
poesy
and
even
kept
up
the
plaudits
long
after
they
might
possibly
have
been
discontinued
never
perhaps
did
any
poet
receive
a
grander
ovation
but
the
exquisitely
tranquil
vanity
of
the
laureate
was
not
a
whit
moved
by
it
his
dazzling
smile
dawned
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
all
over
his
beautiful
face
but
save
for
this
he
gave
no
sign
of
even
hearing
the
deafening
acclamations
that
resounded
about
him
on
all
sides
a
new
ilyspiros
cried
the
king
enthusiastically
and
detaching
a
magnificently
cut
ruby
from
among
the
gems
he
wore
he
flung
it
toward
his
favored
minstrel
it
flashed
through
the
air
like
a
bright
spark
of
flame
and
fell
glistening
redly
on
the
pavement
just
between
theos
and
theos
eyed
it
with
faintly
amused
indifference
the
laureate
bowed
gracefully
but
did
not
stoop
to
raise
it
he
left
that
task
to
his
who
taking
it
up
presented
it
to
his
master
humbly
on
one
knee
then
and
only
then
received
it
kissed
it
lightly
and
placed
it
negligently
among
his
other
ornaments
smiling
at
the
king
as
he
did
so
with
the
air
of
one
who
graciously
condescends
to
accept
a
gift
out
of
kindly
feeling
for
the
donor
zabastes
meanwhile
had
witnessed
the
scene
with
an
expression
of
mingled
impatience
malignity
and
disgust
written
plainly
on
his
furrowed
features
and
as
soon
as
the
hubbub
of
applause
had
subsided
he
struck
his
staff
on
the
ground
with
an
angry
clang
and
exclaimed
irritably
now
may
the
god
shield
us
from
a
plague
of
fools
what
means
this
throaty
clamor
ye
praise
what
ye
do
not
understand
like
all
the
rest
of
the
discerning
public
many
is
the
time
as
the
weariness
of
my
spirit
witnesseth
that
i
have
heard
rehearse
but
never
in
all
my
experience
of
his
prolix
multiloquence
hath
he
given
utterance
to
such
a
senseless
of
as
strange
it
is
that
the
trick
of
confusedly
heaping
words
together
regardless
of
meaning
should
so
bewilder
men
and
deprive
them
of
all
wise
and
sober
judgment
by
my
faith
i
would
as
soon
listen
to
the
gabble
of
geese
in
a
farmyard
as
to
the
silly
glibness
of
such
inflated
twaddle
such
mawkish
sentiment
such
turgid
garrulity
such
ranting
verbosity
a
burst
of
laughter
interrupted
and
drowned
his
harsh
voice
laughter
in
which
no
one
joined
more
heartily
than
himself
he
had
resumed
his
seat
in
his
ivory
chair
and
leaning
back
lazily
he
surveyed
his
critic
with
tolerant
and
complete
amusement
while
the
king
stentorian
ha
ha
ha
resounded
in
ringing
peals
through
the
great
thou
droll
knave
cried
zephoranim
at
last
dashing
away
the
drops
his
merriment
had
brought
into
his
eyes
wilt
kill
me
with
thy
jests
of
a
truth
my
sides
ache
at
thee
what
ails
thee
now
come
we
will
have
patience
if
so
be
our
mirth
can
be
restrained
speak
what
flaw
canst
thou
find
in
our
pearl
of
poesy
what
spots
on
the
sun
of
his
divine
inspiration
as
the
serpent
lives
thou
art
an
excellent
mountebank
and
well
deservest
thy
master
pay
he
laughed
again
but
zabastes
seemed
in
nowise
disconcerted
his
withered
countenance
appeared
to
harden
itself
into
lines
of
impenetrable
obstinacy
tucking
his
long
staff
under
his
arm
he
put
his
fingers
together
in
the
manner
of
one
who
inwardly
counts
up
certain
numbers
and
with
a
preparatory
smack
of
his
lips
he
began
free
speech
being
permitted
to
me
o
most
mighty
zephoranim
i
would
in
the
first
place
say
that
the
poem
so
greatly
admired
by
your
majesty
is
totally
devoid
of
common
sense
it
is
purely
a
caprice
of
the
imagination
and
what
is
imagination
a
mere
aberration
of
the
cerebral
nerves
a
morbidity
of
brain
in
which
the
thoughts
brood
on
the
impossible
on
things
that
have
never
been
and
never
will
be
thus
verse
resembles
the
incoherent
ravings
of
a
madman
moreover
it
hath
a
prevailing
tone
of
forced
sublimity
here
theos
gave
an
involuntary
start
then
recollecting
where
he
was
resumed
his
passive
attitude
which
is
in
every
way
distasteful
to
the
ears
that
love
plain
language
for
instance
what
warrant
is
there
for
this
most
foolish
line
solemn
chanting
of
the
midnight
stars
is
vile
is
vile
for
who
ever
heard
the
midnight
stars
or
any
other
stars
chant
who
can
prove
that
the
heavenly
bodies
are
given
to
the
study
of
music
hath
been
present
at
their
singing
lesson
here
the
old
critic
chuckled
and
warming
with
his
subject
advanced
a
step
nearer
to
the
throne
as
he
went
on
hear
yet
another
jarring
simile
wild
winds
moan
for
pity
of
the
world
was
ever
a
more
indiscreet
lie
a
brazen
lie
for
the
tales
of
shipwreck
sufficiently
prove
the
pitilessness
of
winds
and
however
much
a
may
pretend
to
be
in
the
confidence
of
nature
he
is
after
all
but
the
dupe
of
his
own
frenetic
dreams
one
couplet
hath
most
discordantly
annoyed
my
senses
is
the
veriest
doggerel
sun
with
amorous
clutch
tears
off
the
emerald
girdle
of
the
rose
o
monstrous
piece
of
extravagance
for
how
can
the
sun
his
deity
set
apart
without
hands
and
as
for
emerald
girdle
of
the
rose
i
know
not
what
it
means
unless
considers
the
green
calyx
of
the
flower
a
in
which
case
his
wits
must
be
far
gone
for
no
shape
of
girdle
can
any
sane
man
descry
in
the
common
natural
protection
of
a
bud
before
it
blooms
there
was
a
phrase
too
concerning
nightingales
and
the
gods
know
we
have
heard
enough
and
too
much
of
those
birds
here
he
was
interrupted
by
one
of
his
frequent
attacks
of
coughing
and
again
the
laughter
of
the
whole
court
broke
forth
in
joyous
echoes
laugh
laugh
said
zabastes
recovering
himself
and
eying
the
throng
with
a
derisive
smile
laugh
ye
witless
bantlings
born
of
folly
and
cling
as
you
will
to
the
unsubstantial
dreams
your
laureate
blows
for
you
in
the
air
like
a
child
playing
with
empty
and
perishable
are
they
all
they
shine
for
a
moment
then
break
and
vanish
and
the
colors
wherewith
they
sparkled
colors
deemed
immortal
in
their
beauty
shall
pass
away
like
a
breath
and
be
renewed
no
more
not
so
interposed
theos
suddenly
unknowing
why
he
spoke
but
feeling
inwardly
compelled
to
take
up
for
the
colors
are
immortal
and
permeate
the
universe
whether
seen
in
the
or
the
rainbow
seven
tones
of
light
exist
with
the
seven
tones
in
music
and
much
of
what
we
call
art
and
poesy
is
but
the
constant
reflex
of
these
tints
and
sounds
can
a
critic
enter
more
closely
into
the
secrets
of
nature
than
a
poet
nay
for
he
would
undo
all
creation
were
he
able
and
find
fault
with
its
fairest
productions
the
critical
mind
dwells
too
persistently
on
the
mere
surface
of
things
ever
to
comprehend
or
probe
the
central
deeps
and
of
thought
will
a
zabastes
move
us
to
tears
and
passion
will
he
make
our
pulses
beat
with
any
happier
thrill
or
stir
our
blood
into
a
warmer
glow
he
may
be
able
to
sever
the
petals
of
a
lily
and
name
its
different
sections
its
way
of
growth
and
habitude
but
can
he
raise
it
from
the
ground
alive
and
fair
a
perfect
flower
full
of
sweet
odors
and
still
sweeter
suggestions
no
but
with
entrancing
art
can
make
us
see
not
one
lily
but
a
thousand
lilies
all
waving
in
the
light
wind
of
his
fancy
not
one
world
but
a
thousand
worlds
circling
through
the
empyrean
of
his
rhythmic
splendor
not
one
joy
but
a
thousand
joys
all
quivering
through
the
radiance
of
his
clear
illumined
inspiration
the
heart
the
human
heart
alone
is
the
final
touchstone
of
a
genius
and
when
that
responds
who
shall
deny
his
deathless
fame
loud
applause
followed
these
words
and
the
king
leaning
forward
clapped
theos
familiarly
on
the
shoulder
bravely
spoken
sir
stranger
he
exclaimed
thou
hast
well
vindicated
thy
friend
honor
and
by
my
soul
thou
hast
a
musical
tongue
of
thine
own
who
knows
but
that
thou
also
may
be
a
poet
yet
in
time
to
come
and
thou
zabastes
here
he
turned
upon
the
old
critic
who
while
theos
spoke
had
surveyed
him
with
much
cynical
disdain
get
thee
hence
thine
arguments
are
all
at
fault
as
usual
thou
art
thyself
a
disappointed
author
hence
thy
spleen
thou
art
blind
and
deaf
selfish
and
obstinate
for
thee
the
very
sun
is
a
blot
rather
than
a
brightness
thou
couldst
in
thine
own
opinion
have
created
a
fairer
luminary
doubtless
had
the
matter
been
left
to
thee
aye
aye
we
know
thee
for
a
beauty
hating
fool
and
though
we
laugh
at
thee
we
find
thee
wearisome
stand
thou
aside
and
be
straightway
forgotten
we
will
entreat
for
another
song
the
discomfited
zabastes
retired
grumbling
to
himself
in
an
undertone
and
the
laureate
whose
dreamy
eyes
had
till
now
rested
on
theos
his
self
constituted
advocate
with
an
appreciative
and
almost
tender
regard
once
more
took
up
his
harp
and
striking
a
few
rich
soft
chords
was
about
to
sing
again
when
a
great
noise
as
of
clanking
armor
was
heard
outside
mingled
with
a
steadily
increasing
sonorous
hum
of
many
voices
and
the
increased
tramp
tramp
of
marching
feet
the
doors
were
flung
open
the
entered
in
hot
haste
and
excitement
and
prostrating
himself
before
the
throne
exclaimed
o
great
king
may
thy
name
live
forever
khosrul
is
taken
zephoranim
black
brows
drew
together
in
a
dark
scowl
and
he
set
his
lips
hard
so
for
once
thou
art
quick
tongued
in
the
utterance
of
news
he
said
bring
hither
the
captive
an
he
chafes
at
his
bonds
we
will
ourselves
release
him
and
he
touched
his
sword
significantly
to
a
wider
freedom
than
is
found
on
earth
a
thrill
ran
through
the
courtly
throng
at
these
words
and
the
women
shuddered
and
grew
pale
irritated
at
the
sudden
interruption
that
had
thus
distracted
the
general
attention
from
his
own
fair
and
flattered
self
gave
an
expressively
petulant
glance
toward
theos
who
smiled
back
at
him
soothingly
as
one
who
seeks
to
coax
a
spoilt
child
out
of
its
and
then
all
eyes
were
turned
expectantly
toward
the
entrance
of
the
a
band
of
soldiers
clad
from
head
to
foot
in
glittering
steel
armor
and
carrying
short
drawn
swords
appeared
and
marched
with
quick
ringing
steps
across
the
hall
toward
the
throne
arrived
at
the
dais
they
halted
wheeled
about
saluted
and
parted
asunder
in
two
compact
lines
thus
displaying
in
their
midst
the
bound
and
manacled
figure
of
a
tall
gaunt
old
man
with
eyes
that
burned
like
bright
flames
beneath
the
cavernous
shadow
of
his
bent
and
shelving
brows
a
man
whose
aspect
was
so
grand
and
withal
so
terrible
that
an
involuntary
murmur
of
mingled
admiration
and
affright
broke
from
the
lips
of
all
assembled
like
a
low
wind
surging
among
branches
this
was
khosrul
the
prophet
of
a
creed
that
was
to
revolutionize
the
world
the
fanatic
for
a
faith
as
yet
unrevealed
to
men
the
dauntless
foreteller
of
the
downfall
of
and
its
king
theos
stared
wonderingly
at
at
his
funereal
black
garments
which
clung
to
him
with
the
closeness
of
a
shroud
at
his
long
untrimmed
beard
and
hair
that
fell
in
disordered
matted
locks
below
his
shoulders
at
his
majestic
form
which
in
spite
of
cords
and
feathers
he
held
firmly
erect
in
an
attitude
of
fearless
and
composed
dignity
there
was
something
supernaturally
grand
and
about
him
something
commanding
as
well
as
defiant
in
the
straight
and
steady
look
with
which
he
confronted
the
king
and
for
a
moment
or
so
a
deep
silence
reigned
silence
apparently
born
of
superstitious
dread
inspired
by
the
mere
fact
of
his
presence
zephoranim
glance
rested
upon
him
with
cold
and
supercilious
indifference
seated
haughtily
upright
in
his
throne
with
one
hand
resting
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
he
showed
no
sign
of
anger
against
or
interest
in
his
prisoner
save
that
to
the
observant
eye
of
theos
the
veins
in
his
forehead
seemed
to
become
suddenly
knotted
and
swollen
while
the
jewels
on
his
bare
chest
heaved
restlessly
up
and
down
with
the
unquiet
panting
of
his
quickened
breath
we
give
thee
greeting
khosrul
he
said
slowly
and
with
a
sinister
smile
the
lion
paw
has
struck
thee
down
at
last
too
long
hast
thou
trifled
with
our
patience
thou
must
abjure
thy
heresies
or
die
what
sayest
thou
now
of
doom
of
judgment
of
the
waning
of
glory
wilt
prophesy
wilt
denounce
the
faith
wilt
mislead
the
people
wilt
curse
the
king
thou
mad
sorcerer
devil
bewitched
and
blasphemous
what
shall
hinder
me
from
at
once
slaying
thee
and
he
half
drew
his
formidable
sword
from
its
sheath
khosrul
met
his
threatening
gaze
unflinchingly
nothing
shall
hinder
thee
zephoranim
he
replied
and
his
voice
deeply
musical
and
resonant
struck
to
theos
heart
with
a
strange
foreboding
chill
nothing
save
thine
own
scorn
of
cowardice
the
monarch
hand
fell
from
his
a
flush
of
shame
reddened
his
dark
face
he
bent
his
fiery
eyes
full
on
the
captive
and
there
was
something
in
the
sorrowful
grandeur
of
the
old
man
bearing
coupled
with
his
enfeebled
and
defenceless
condition
that
seemed
to
touch
him
with
a
sense
of
compassion
for
turning
suddenly
to
the
armed
guard
he
raised
his
hand
with
a
gesture
of
authority
unloose
his
fetters
he
commanded
the
men
hesitated
apparently
doubting
whether
they
had
heard
aright
zephoranim
stamped
his
foot
impatiently
unloose
him
i
say
by
the
gods
must
i
repeat
the
same
thing
twice
since
when
have
soldiers
grown
deaf
to
the
voice
of
their
sovereign
and
why
have
ye
bound
this
aged
fool
with
such
many
and
tight
bonds
his
veins
and
sinews
are
not
of
iron
methinks
ye
might
have
tied
him
with
thread
and
met
with
small
resistance
i
have
known
many
a
muscular
deserter
from
the
army
fastened
less
securely
when
captured
unloose
him
and
quickly
too
our
pleasure
is
that
ere
he
dies
he
shall
speak
an
he
will
in
his
own
defence
as
a
free
man
in
trembling
haste
and
eagerness
the
guards
at
once
set
to
work
to
obey
this
order
the
twisted
cords
were
untied
the
heavy
iron
fetters
wrenched
asunder
and
in
a
very
short
space
khosrul
stood
at
comparative
liberty
at
first
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
the
generosity
toward
him
in
this
respect
for
he
made
no
attempt
to
move
his
limbs
were
rigidly
composed
as
though
they
were
still
bound
and
so
stiff
and
motionless
was
his
weird
attenuated
figure
that
theos
beholding
him
began
to
wonder
whether
he
were
made
of
actual
flesh
and
blood
or
whether
he
might
not
more
possibly
be
some
gaunt
spectre
forced
back
by
mystic
art
from
another
world
in
order
to
testify
of
things
unknown
to
living
men
zephoranim
meanwhile
called
for
his
a
beautiful
youth
radiant
as
ganymede
who
at
a
sign
from
his
royal
master
approached
the
prophet
and
pouring
wine
from
a
jewelled
flagon
into
a
goblet
of
gold
offered
it
to
him
with
a
courteous
salute
and
smile
khosrul
started
violently
like
one
suddenly
wakened
from
a
deep
dream
shading
his
eyes
with
his
lean
and
wrinkled
hand
he
stared
dubiously
at
the
young
and
gayly
attired
servitor
then
pushed
the
goblet
aside
with
a
shuddering
gesture
of
aversion
away
away
he
muttered
in
a
thrilling
whisper
that
penetrated
to
every
part
of
the
vast
hall
wilt
force
me
to
drink
blood
he
paused
and
in
the
same
low
tone
continued
blood
blood
it
stains
the
earth
and
sky
its
red
red
waves
swallow
up
the
land
the
heavens
grow
pale
and
tremble
the
silver
stars
blacken
and
decay
and
the
winds
of
the
desert
make
lament
for
that
which
shall
come
to
pass
ere
ever
the
grapes
be
pressed
or
the
harvest
gathered
blood
blood
the
blood
of
the
innocent
is
a
scarlet
sea
wherein
like
a
broken
and
empty
ship
founders
founders
never
to
rise
again
these
words
uttered
with
such
hushed
yet
passionate
intensity
produced
a
most
profound
impression
several
courtiers
exchanged
uneasy
glances
and
the
women
half
rose
from
their
seats
looking
toward
the
king
as
though
silently
requesting
permission
to
retire
but
an
imperious
negative
sign
from
zephoranim
obliged
them
to
resume
their
places
though
they
did
so
with
obvious
nervous
reluctance
thou
art
mad
khosrul
then
said
the
monarch
in
calmly
measured
accents
and
for
thy
madness
as
also
for
thine
age
we
have
till
now
retarded
justice
out
of
pity
nevertheless
excess
of
pity
in
great
kings
too
oft
degenerates
into
weakness
and
this
we
can
not
suffer
to
be
said
of
us
not
even
for
the
sake
of
sparing
thy
few
poor
remaining
years
thou
hast
overstepped
the
limit
of
our
leniency
and
madman
as
thou
art
thou
showest
a
madman
cunning
thou
dost
break
the
laws
and
art
dangerous
to
the
realm
thou
art
proved
a
traitor
and
must
straightway
die
thou
art
accused
of
honesty
interrupt
khosrul
suddenly
with
a
touch
of
melancholy
satire
in
his
tone
i
have
spoken
truth
in
an
age
of
lies
is
a
most
deed
he
ceased
and
again
seemed
to
retire
within
himself
as
though
he
were
a
voice
entering
at
will
into
the
carven
image
of
man
zephoranim
frowned
angrily
yet
answered
nothing
and
a
brief
pause
ensued
theos
grew
more
and
more
painfully
interested
in
the
scene
there
was
something
in
it
that
to
his
mind
seemed
fatefully
suggestive
and
fraught
with
impending
evil
suddenly
looked
up
his
bright
face
alit
with
laughter
now
by
the
sacred
veil
he
said
gayly
addressing
himself
to
the
king
your
majesty
considers
this
venerable
gentleman
with
too
much
gravity
i
recognize
in
him
one
of
my
craft
a
poet
tragic
and
taciturn
of
humor
and
with
a
taste
for
melodramatic
simile
marked
you
not
the
mixing
of
his
in
the
picture
he
drew
of
foundering
like
a
wrecked
ship
in
a
sea
whilst
overhead
trembled
a
white
sky
set
thick
with
blackening
stars
as
i
live
was
not
for
a
madman
brain
and
so
solemn
a
ranter
should
serve
your
majesty
to
make
merriment
withal
in
place
of
my
poor
zabastes
whose
peevish
jests
grow
somewhat
stale
owing
to
the
critic
chronic
want
of
originality
nay
i
myself
shall
be
willing
to
enter
into
a
rhyming
joust
with
so
disconsolately
morose
a
contemporary
and
who
knows
whether
betwixt
us
twain
the
chords
of
the
major
and
minor
may
not
be
harmonized
in
some
new
and
altogether
marvellous
fashion
of
music
such
as
we
wot
not
of
and
turning
to
khosrul
he
added
wilt
break
a
lance
of
song
with
me
sir
thou
shalt
croak
of
death
and
i
will
chant
of
love
and
the
king
shall
pronounce
judgment
as
to
which
melody
hath
the
most
potent
and
lasting
sweetness
khosrul
lifted
his
head
and
met
the
laureate
smile
with
a
look
of
infinite
compassion
in
his
own
deep
solemnly
penetrating
eyes
thou
poor
deluded
singer
of
a
perishable
day
he
said
mournfully
alas
for
thee
that
thou
must
die
so
soon
and
be
so
soon
forgotten
thy
fame
is
worthless
as
a
grain
of
sand
blown
by
the
breath
of
the
sea
thy
pride
and
thy
triumph
evanescent
as
the
mists
of
the
morning
that
vanish
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
great
has
been
the
measure
of
thine
inspiration
yet
thou
hast
missed
its
true
teaching
and
of
all
the
golden
threads
of
poesy
placed
freely
in
thy
hands
thou
hast
not
woven
one
clew
whereby
thou
shouldst
find
god
alas
bright
soul
unconscious
of
thy
fate
thou
shalt
be
suddenly
and
roughly
slain
and
there
sits
thy
destroyer
and
as
he
spoke
he
raised
his
shrunken
hand
and
pointed
steadfastly
to
the
king
there
was
a
momentary
hush
a
stillness
as
of
stupefied
amazement
and
horror
then
to
the
apparent
relief
of
all
present
zephoranim
burst
out
laughing
by
all
the
virtues
of
nagaya
he
cried
this
is
most
excellent
fooling
i
zephoranim
the
destroyer
of
my
friend
and
first
favorite
in
the
realm
old
man
thy
frenzy
exceeds
belief
and
exhausts
patience
though
of
a
truth
i
am
sorry
for
the
shattering
of
thy
wits
is
sad
that
reason
should
be
lacking
to
one
so
revered
and
grave
of
aspect
dear
to
me
as
my
royal
crown
is
the
life
of
through
whose
inspired
writings
alone
my
name
shall
live
in
the
annals
of
future
history
for
the
glory
of
a
great
poet
must
ever
surpass
the
renown
of
the
greatest
king
were
besieged
by
a
thousand
enemies
and
these
strong
razed
to
the
ground
by
the
engines
of
warfare
we
would
ourselves
defend
aye
even
cry
aloud
in
the
heat
of
combat
that
he
the
chief
minstrel
of
our
land
should
be
sheltered
from
fury
and
spared
from
death
as
the
only
one
capable
of
chronicling
our
vanquishment
of
victory
smiled
and
bowed
gracefully
in
response
to
this
enthusiastic
assurance
of
his
sovereign
friendship
but
nevertheless
there
was
a
slight
shadow
of
uneasiness
on
his
bold
beautiful
brows
he
had
evidently
been
uncomfortably
impressed
by
khosrul
words
and
the
restless
anxiety
reflected
in
his
face
communicated
itself
by
a
sort
of
electric
thrill
to
theos
whose
heart
began
to
beat
heavily
with
a
sense
of
vague
alarm
what
is
this
khosrul
he
thought
half
resentfully
and
how
dares
he
predict
for
the
adored
the
admired
so
dark
and
unmerited
an
end
hark
what
was
that
low
rumbling
as
of
underground
wheels
rolling
at
full
speed
he
listened
then
glanced
at
those
persons
who
stood
nearest
to
him
no
one
seemed
to
hear
anything
unusual
moreover
all
eyes
were
fixed
fearfully
on
khosrul
whose
before
rigidly
sombre
demeanor
had
suddenly
changed
and
who
now
with
raised
head
tossed
hair
outstretched
arms
and
wild
gestures
looked
like
a
flaming
terror
personified
victory
victory
he
cried
catching
at
the
king
last
word
there
shall
be
no
more
victory
for
thee
zephoranim
thy
conquests
are
ended
and
the
flag
of
thy
glory
shall
cease
to
wave
on
the
towers
of
thy
strong
citadels
death
stands
behind
thee
destruction
clamors
at
thy
and
the
enemy
that
cometh
upon
thee
unawares
is
an
enemy
that
none
shall
vanquish
or
subdue
not
even
they
who
are
mightiest
among
the
mighty
thy
strong
men
of
war
shall
be
trodden
down
as
wheat
thy
captains
and
rulers
shall
tremble
and
wail
as
children
bewildered
with
fear
thy
great
engines
of
battle
shall
be
to
thee
as
naught
and
the
arrows
of
thy
skilled
archers
shall
be
useless
as
straws
in
the
gathering
tempest
of
fire
and
fury
zephoranim
zephoranim
and
his
voice
shrilled
with
terrific
emphasis
through
the
vaulted
chamber
the
days
of
recompense
are
come
upon
thee
swift
and
terrible
as
the
the
doom
of
is
spoken
and
who
shall
avert
its
fulfilment
the
magnificent
shall
shall
fall
its
beauty
its
greatness
its
pleasantness
its
power
shall
be
utterly
and
ere
the
waning
of
the
midsummer
moon
not
one
stone
of
its
glorious
buildings
shall
be
left
to
prove
that
here
was
once
a
city
fire
fire
and
here
he
ran
abruptly
to
the
foot
of
the
royal
dais
his
dark
garments
brushing
against
theos
as
he
passed
and
springing
on
the
first
step
stood
boldly
within
of
the
king
who
taken
aback
by
the
suddenness
of
his
action
stared
at
him
with
a
sort
of
amazed
and
angry
to
arms
zephoranim
to
arms
take
up
thy
sword
and
get
thee
forth
and
fight
with
fire
fire
how
shall
the
king
quench
it
how
shall
the
mighty
monarch
defend
his
people
against
it
see
you
not
how
it
fills
the
air
with
red
devouring
tongues
of
flame
the
thick
smoke
reeks
of
blood
the
magnificent
the
pleasant
city
of
sin
the
idolatrous
city
is
broken
in
pieces
and
is
become
a
waste
of
ashes
who
will
join
with
me
in
a
lament
for
i
will
call
upon
the
desert
of
the
sea
to
hear
my
voice
i
will
pour
forth
my
sorrows
on
the
wind
and
it
shall
carry
the
burden
of
grief
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
all
nations
shall
shudder
and
be
astonished
at
the
direful
end
of
the
city
beautiful
the
empress
of
kingdoms
woe
unto
for
she
hath
suffered
herself
to
be
led
astray
by
her
rulers
she
hath
drunken
deep
of
the
innocent
blood
and
hath
followed
after
idols
her
abominations
are
manifold
and
the
hearts
of
her
young
men
and
maidens
are
full
of
evil
therefore
because
delighteth
in
pride
and
despiseth
repentance
so
shall
destruction
descend
furiously
upon
her
even
as
a
sudden
tempest
in
the
of
the
night
she
shall
be
swept
away
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
wolves
shall
make
their
lair
in
her
pleasant
gardens
and
the
generations
of
men
shall
remember
her
no
more
oh
ye
kings
princes
and
warriors
weep
weep
for
the
doom
of
and
now
his
wild
voice
sank
by
degrees
into
a
piteous
plaintiveness
weep
for
never
again
on
earth
shall
be
found
a
fairer
for
the
lovers
of
joy
never
again
shall
be
builded
a
grander
city
for
the
glory
and
wealth
of
a
people
thou
that
boastest
of
ancient
days
and
long
lineage
thou
art
become
a
forgotten
heap
of
ruin
the
sands
of
the
desert
shall
cover
thy
temples
and
palaces
and
none
hereafter
shall
inquire
concerning
thee
none
shall
bemoan
thee
none
shall
shed
tears
for
the
grievous
manner
of
thy
death
none
shall
know
the
names
of
thy
mighty
heroes
and
men
of
fame
for
thou
shalt
vanish
utterly
and
be
lost
far
out
of
memory
even
as
though
thou
hadst
never
been
here
he
stopped
abruptly
and
caught
his
breath
hard
his
blazing
eyes
preternaturally
large
and
brilliant
fixed
themselves
steadfastly
on
the
sculptured
ivory
shield
that
surmounted
the
back
of
the
king
throne
and
over
his
drawn
and
wrinkled
features
came
an
expression
of
such
ghastly
horror
that
instinctively
every
one
present
turned
their
looks
in
the
same
direction
suddenly
a
shriek
piercing
and
terrible
broke
from
his
lips
a
shriek
that
like
a
swiftly
descending
knife
seemed
to
saw
the
air
discordantly
asunder
see
see
he
cried
in
fierce
haste
and
eagerness
see
how
the
crested
head
gleams
how
the
soft
shiny
throat
curves
and
glistens
how
the
lithe
body
twists
and
twines
hence
hence
accursed
snake
poisoner
of
peace
thou
quivering
sting
in
the
flesh
thou
destroyer
of
the
strength
of
manhood
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
zephoranim
that
thou
dost
wind
thy
many
coils
about
his
heart
lysia
lysia
here
the
king
started
violently
his
face
flushing
darkly
red
thou
delicate
abomination
thou
tyrannous
what
shall
be
done
unto
thee
in
the
hour
of
darkness
put
off
put
off
the
ornaments
of
gold
and
the
jewels
wherewith
thou
adornest
thy
beauty
and
crown
thyself
with
the
crown
of
an
endless
affliction
for
thou
shalt
be
girdled
round
about
with
flame
and
fire
shall
be
thy
garment
thy
lips
that
have
drunken
sweet
wine
shall
be
steeped
in
bitterness
vainly
shalt
thou
make
thyself
fair
and
call
aloud
on
thy
legion
of
lovers
they
shall
be
as
dead
men
deaf
to
thine
entreaties
and
none
shall
answer
thee
no
not
one
none
shall
hide
thee
from
shame
or
offer
thee
comfort
in
the
midst
of
thy
lascivious
delights
shalt
thou
suddenly
perish
and
my
soul
shall
be
avenged
on
thy
sins
thou
unvirgined
virgin
thou
scarcely
had
he
uttered
the
last
word
when
the
king
with
a
furious
oath
sprang
upon
him
grasped
him
by
the
throat
and
thrusting
him
fiercely
down
on
the
steps
of
the
dais
placed
one
foot
on
his
prostrate
body
then
drawing
his
gigantic
sword
he
lifted
it
on
high
the
blight
blade
glittered
in
air
an
audible
gasp
of
terror
broke
from
the
throng
of
spectators
another
second
and
khosrul
life
would
have
paid
the
forfeit
for
his
temerity
when
crash
a
sudden
and
tremendous
clap
of
thunder
shook
the
hall
and
every
lamp
was
extinguished
impenetrable
darkness
reigned
thick
close
suffocating
darkness
the
thunder
rolled
away
in
sullen
vibrating
echoes
and
there
was
a
short
impressive
silence
then
piercing
through
the
profound
gloom
came
the
clamorous
cries
and
shrieks
of
frightened
women
the
horrible
selfish
scrambling
pushing
and
struggling
of
a
bewildered
crowd
the
helpless
nerveless
unreasoning
distraction
that
human
beings
exhibit
when
striving
together
for
escape
from
some
imminent
deadly
peril
and
though
the
king
stentorian
voice
could
be
heard
above
all
the
tumult
loudly
commanding
order
his
alternate
threats
and
persuasions
were
of
no
avail
to
calm
the
frenzy
of
fear
into
which
the
whole
court
was
thrown
groans
and
sobs
wild
entreaties
to
nagaya
and
the
curses
from
the
soldiery
who
intent
on
saving
themselves
were
brutally
trying
to
force
a
passage
to
the
door
regardless
of
the
wailing
women
whose
frantic
appeals
for
rescue
and
assistance
were
to
hear
all
these
sounds
increased
the
horror
of
the
situation
and
theos
blind
giddy
and
confused
listened
to
the
uproar
around
him
with
something
of
the
affrighted
compassion
that
a
stranger
in
hell
might
be
supposed
to
feel
when
hearkening
to
the
ceaseless
plaints
of
the
wicked
he
endeavored
to
grope
his
way
to
side
and
just
then
lights
appeared
lights
that
were
not
of
earth
kindling
strange
wandering
flames
that
danced
and
flitted
along
the
tapestried
walls
like
on
a
dark
morass
and
flung
a
ghastly
blue
glare
on
the
pale
uneasy
faces
of
the
scared
people
till
gathering
in
a
sort
of
lurid
ring
round
the
throne
they
outlined
in
strong
relief
the
enraged
titanesque
figure
of
zephoranim
whose
upraised
sword
looked
in
itself
like
an
arrested
flash
of
lightning
brighter
and
brighter
grew
the
weird
lustre
illumining
the
whole
the
vast
length
of
the
splendid
hall
the
shining
armor
of
the
soldiers
the
white
robes
of
the
women
the
flags
and
pennons
that
hung
from
the
roof
and
swayed
to
and
fro
as
though
blown
by
a
gust
of
every
object
near
and
distant
was
soon
as
visible
as
in
broad
day
and
then
a
terrible
cry
of
rage
burst
from
the
king
the
cry
of
a
maddened
wild
beast
death
and
fury
he
shouted
striking
his
sword
with
a
fierce
clang
against
the
silver
pedestal
of
the
throne
where
is
khosrul
the
silence
of
an
absolute
dismay
answered
him
khosrul
had
fled
like
a
cloud
melting
in
air
or
a
ghost
vanishing
into
the
he
had
mysteriously
disappeared
he
had
escaped
no
one
knew
how
from
under
the
very
feet
and
out
of
the
very
grasp
of
the
irate
monarch
whose
baffled
wrath
now
knew
no
bounds
dolts
idiots
cowards
and
he
hurled
these
epithets
at
the
timorous
crowd
with
all
the
ferocity
of
a
giant
hurling
stones
at
a
swarm
of
babes
that
are
frighted
by
a
summer
ye
have
let
yon
accursed
heretic
slip
from
my
hands
ere
i
had
choked
him
with
his
own
lie
o
ye
fools
ye
puny
villains
i
take
shame
to
myself
that

hearts
that
ever
failed
for
dastard
fear
shut
fast
the
close

every

and
corner
lest
haply
this
base
false
prophet
be
still
here
in

that
blasphemed
with
ribald
tongue
the
high
priestess
of
our
faith
the
holy
virgin
lysia
are
ye
all
turned
renegades
and
traitors
that
ye
will
suffer

lawless

ye
shameless
knaves
ye
rascals
what
abject
terror
makes
ye
thus
quiver
like
in
a
storm
this
darkness
is
but
a
conjurer
trick
to
scare

and
khosrul
followers

so
play
with
the
strings
of
electricity
that

duped
into

even

i
am
a
man
dauntless
a
soldier
unafraid
his
powerful
and
indignant
voice
had
the
effect
of
partially
checking
the
panic
and
restoring
something
like
order
the
pushing
and
struggling
for
an
immediate
exit
ceased
the
armed
guards
in
shamed
silence
began
to
marshal
themselves
together
in
readiness
to
start
on
the
search
for
the
fugitive
and
several
pages
rushed
in
with
flaring
torches
which
cast
a
wondrous
on
the
surging
throng
of
eager
and
timid
faces
the
brilliant
costumes
the
flash
of
jewels
the
glimmer
of
swords
and
the
dark
outlines
of
the
fluttering
tapestry
all
forming
together
a
curious
chiaroscuro
from
which
the
massive
figure
of
zephoranim
stood
out
in
bold
and
striking
prominence
against
the
white
and
silver
background
of
his
throne
vaguely
bewildered
and
lost
in
a
dim
stupefaction
of
wonderment
theos
looked
upon
everything
with
an
odd
sense
of
strained
calmness
the
glittering
saloon
whirled
before
his
eyes
like
a
passing
picture
in
a
magic
glass
and
then
an
imperative
knowledge
forced
itself
upon
his
mind
he
had
witnessed
this
scene
before
where
and
when
impossible
to
say
but
he
distinctly
remembered
each
incident
this
impression
however
left
him
as
rapidly
as
it
had
come
before
he
had
any
time
to
puzzle
himself
about
it
and
just
at
that
moment
hand
caught
his
own
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
let
us
away
my
friend
there
will
be
naught
now
but
mounting
of
guards
and
dire
confusion
the
king
is
as
a
lion
roused
and
will
not
cease
growling
till
his
vengeance
be
satisfied
a
plague
on
this
prophet
he
hath
broken
through
my
music
and
jarred
poesy
into
discord
by
the
sacred
veil
didst
ever
hear
such
a
hideous
clamor
of
contradictory
tongues
all
striving
to
explain
what
defies
explanation
namely
khosrul
flight
for
which
after
all
no
one
is
to
blame
so
much
as
zephoranim
himself
but
is
the
privilege
of
monarchs
to
shift
their
own
mistakes
and
follies
on
to
the
shoulders
of
their
subjects
come
lysia
awaits
us
and
will
not
easily
pardon
our
tardy
obedience
to
her
summons
let
us
hence
ere
the
gates
of
the
palace
close
lysia
the
unvirgined
virgin
the
queen
courtesan
so
had
said
khosrul
nevertheless
her
name
like
a
silver
clarion
made
the
heart
of
theos
bound
with
indescribable
gladness
and
feverish
expectation
and
without
an
instant
pause
he
readily
yielded
to
guidance
through
the
gorgeously
colored
confusion
of
the
swaying
crowd
the
twain
one
a
poet
renowned
the
other
a
poet
forgotten
threaded
their
rapid
way
between
the
ranks
of
nobles
officers
slaves
and
who
were
all
excitedly
discussing
the
recent
scare
the
prophet
escape
and
the
dread
wrath
of
the
king
and
hurrying
along
the
vast
hall
of
the
two
thousand
columns
they
passed
together
out
into
the
night

virgin
unshrined
under
the
cloudless
sky
in
the
soft
warm
air
that
brimmed
with
the
fragrance
of
roses
they
drove
once
more
together
through
the
spacious
streets
of
streets
that
were
now
nearly
deserted
save
for
a
few
late
whose
figures
were
almost
as
indistinct
and
rapid
in
motion
as
pale
flitting
shadows
there
was
not
a
sign
of
storm
in
the
lovely
heavens
though
now
and
again
a
sullen
roll
as
of
a
distant
cannonade
hinted
of
anger
lurking
somewhere
behind
that
clear
and
exquisitely
ether
in
which
a
million
worlds
blazed
luminously
like
pendulous
drops
of
white
fire
chariot
whirled
along
with
incredible
swiftness
the
hoofs
of
the
galloping
horses
occasionally
striking
sparks
of
flame
from
the
smooth
pavement
but
theos
now
began
to
notice
that
there
was
a
strange
noiselessness
in
their
movements
that
the
whole
cortege
appeared
to
be
environed
by
a
magic
circle
of
silence
and
that
the
very
night
itself
seemed
breathlessly
listening
in
entranced
awe
to
some
unlanguaged
warning
from
the
gods
invisible
compared
with
the
turbulence
and
terror
just
left
behind
at
the
palace
this
weird
hush
was
uncomfortably
impressive
and
gave
a
sense
of
fantastic
unreality
to
the
scene
the
sleepy
mesmeric
radiance
of
the
full
moon
shining
on
the
delicate
traceries
of
the
quaintly
sculptured
houses
on
either
hand
made
them
look
brittle
and
evanescent
the
great
heavy
hanging
and
the
feathery
frondage
of
the
tall
palms
seemed
outlined
in
mere
mist
against
the
sky
and
the
glimpses
caught
from
time
to
time
of
the
broad
and
quietly
flowing
river
were
like
so
many
flashes
of
light
seen
through
a
veil
of
cloud
theos
standing
beside
his
friend
with
one
hand
resting
familiarly
on
his
shoulder
dreamily
admired
the
beauty
of
the
city
thus
transfigured
in
the
moonbeams
and
though
he
vaguely
wondered
a
little
at
the
deep
mysterious
stillness
that
everywhere
prevailed
he
scarcely
admitted
to
himself
that
there
was
or
could
be
anything
unusual
in
it
he
took
his
position
as
he
found
it
indeed
he
could
not
well
do
otherwise
since
he
felt
his
fate
was
ruled
by
some
resolute
unseen
force
against
which
all
resistance
would
be
unavailing
moreover
his
mind
was
now
entirely
possessed
by
the
haunting
vision
of
lysia
a
vision
a
beautiful
magical
irresistible
sweetness
that
allured
his
soul
and
roused
within
him
a
wordless
passion
of
infinite
desire
he
exchanged
not
a
syllable
with
an
indefinable
yet
tacit
understanding
existed
between
them
an
intuitive
foreknowledge
and
subtle
perception
of
each
other
character
intentions
and
aims
that
for
the
moment
rendered
speech
unnecessary
and
there
was
something
after
all
in
the
profound
silence
of
the
night
that
while
strange
was
also
eloquent
eloquent
of
meanings
unutterable
such
as
lie
hidden
in
the
scented
cups
of
flowers
when
lovers
gather
them
on
idle
summer
afternoons
and
weave
them
into
posies
for
one
another
wearing
how
fleetly
the
gilded
car
sped
on
its
way
trees
houses
bridges
domes
and
cupolas
seemed
to
fly
past
in
a
varied
whirl
of
glistening
color
now
and
again
a
cluster
of
broke
from
some
thicket
of
shade
and
danced
drowsily
by
in
sparkling
tangles
of
gold
and
green
here
and
there
from
great
open
squares
and
gardens
gleamed
the
stone
face
of
an
obelisk
or
the
white
column
of
a
fountain
while
over
all
things
streamed
the
long
prismatic
rays
flung
forth
from
the
revolving
lights
in
the
twelve
towers
of
the
sacred
temple
like
flaming
spears
ranged
lengthwise
against
the
limitless
depth
of
the
midnight
horizon
with
straining
necks
tossed
manes
and
foam
flying
from
their
nostrils
fiery
coursers
dashed
onward
at
almost
lightning
speed
and
the
journey
became
a
wild
headstrong
rush
through
the
dividing
air
a
rush
toward
some
voluptuous
end
dimly
discerned
yet
indefinite
at
last
they
stopped
before
them
rose
a
lofty
building
crested
with
fantastic
pinnacles
such
as
are
formed
by
ice
on
the
roof
in
times
of
intense
cold
a
great
gate
stood
open
and
pacing
slowly
up
and
down
in
front
of
it
was
a
tall
slave
in
white
tunic
and
turban
who
turning
his
gleaming
eyeballs
on
nodded
by
way
of
salutation
and
then
uttered
a
sharp
peculiar
whistle
this
summons
brought
out
two
curious
dwarfish
figures
of
men
whose
awkward
misshapen
limbs
resembled
the
contorted
branches
of
trees
and
whose
coarse
and
repulsive
countenances
betokened
that
malignant
delight
in
which
only
demons
are
supposed
to
know
these
ungainly
servitors
possessed
themselves
of
the
laureate
chafing
steeds
and
led
them
and
the
chariot
away
into
some
unseen
courtyard
while
the
laureate
himself
still
saying
no
word
kept
fast
hold
of
his
companion
arm
and
hurried
him
along
a
dark
avenue
overshadowed
with
thick
boughs
that
drooped
heavily
downward
to
the
ground
a
solitary
place
where
the
intense
quiet
was
disturbed
only
by
the
occasional
drip
drip
of
dewy
moisture
trickling
tearfully
from
the
leaves
or
the
sweet
faint
gurgling
sound
of
fountains
playing
somewhere
in
the
distance
on
they
went
for
several
paces
till
at
a
sharp
bend
in
the
path
an
amethystine
light
broke
full
between
the
arched
green
branches
directly
in
front
of
them
glimmered
a
broad
piece
of
water
and
out
of
the
depths
rose
the
white
nude
lovely
form
of
a
woman
whose
rounded
outstretched
arms
appeared
to
beckon
them
whose
mouth
smiled
in
mingled
malice
and
sweetness
and
round
whose
tresses
sparkled
a
diadem
of
sapphire
flame
with
a
cry
of
astonishment
and
ecstacy
theos
sprang
forward
held
him
back
in
laughing
remonstrance
wilt
drown
for
a
statue
sake
he
inquired
mirthfully
by
my
soul
good
theos
if
thy
wits
thus
wander
at
sight
of
a
witching
marble
nymph
illumed
by
electric
glamours
what
will
become
of
thee
when
thou
art
face
to
face
with
living
breathing
loveliness
come
thou
hotheaded
neophyte
thou
shalt
not
waste
thy
passion
on
images
of
stone
i
warrant
thee
come
but
theos
stood
still
his
eyes
roved
from
to
the
glittering
statue
and
from
the
statue
back
again
to
in
mingled
doubt
and
dread
a
vague
foreboding
filled
his
mind
he
fancied
that
a
bevy
of
mocking
devils
peered
at
him
from
out
the
wooded
labyrinth
and
that
sin
was
the
name
of
the
white
siren
yonder
whose
delicate
body
seemed
to
palpitate
with
every
slow
ripple
of
the
surrounding
waters
he
hesitated
with
that
often
saving
hesitation
a
noble
spirit
may
feel
ere
willfully
yielding
to
what
it
instinctively
knows
to
be
wrong
and
for
the
briefest
possible
space
an
imperceptible
line
was
drawn
between
his
own
and
the
fascinating
personality
of
his
lately
found
friend
a
line
that
parted
them
asunder
as
though
by
a
gulf
of
centuries
he
said
in
a
tremulous
low
tone
tell
me
truly
is
it
good
for
us
to
be
here
regarded
him
in
amazement
good
good
he
repeated
with
a
sort
of
impatient
disdain
what
dost
thou
mean
by
what
is
good
what
is
evil
canst
thou
tell
if
so
thou
art
wiser
than
i
good
to
be
here
if
it
is
good
to
drown
remembrance
of
the
world
in
draughts
of
pleasure
if
it
is
good
to
love
and
be
beloved
if
it
is
good
to
enjoy
aye
enjoy
with
burning
zest
every
pulsation
of
the
blood
and
every
beat
of
the
heart
and
to
feel
that
life
is
a
fiery
delight
an
exquisite
dream
of
rapture
then
it
is
good
to
be
here
if
and
he
caught
theos
hand
in
his
own
warm
palm
and
pressed
it
while
his
voice
sank
to
a
soft
and
infinitely
caressing
sweetness
if
it
is
good
to
climb
the
dizzy
heights
of
joy
and
drowse
in
the
deep
sunshine
of
amorous
eyes
to
slip
away
on
elfin
wings
into
the
limitless
freedom
of
summerland
to
rifle
rich
kisses
from
warm
lips
even
as
rosebuds
are
rifled
from
the
parent
rose
and
to
forget
to
forget
all
bitter
things
that
are
best
forgotten
enough
enough
cried
theos
fired
with
a
reckless
impulse
of
passionate
ardor
on
on
i
follow
thee
on
let
us
delay
no
more
at
that
moment
a
strain
of
music
saluted
his
ears
music
evidently
played
on
stringed
instruments
it
was
accompanied
by
a
ringing
clash
of
cymbals
he
listened
and
listening
saw
a
smile
lighten
features
a
smile
sweet
yet
full
of
delicate
mockery
their
eyes
met
a
wanton
impetuosity
flashed
like
reflected
flame
from
one
face
to
the
other
and
then
without
another
pause
they
hurried
on
across
a
broad
terrace
garlanded
with
a
golden
wealth
of
and
odorous
oleanders
under
a
covered
with
magnolias
whose
buds
glistened
in
the
moonlight
like
large
suspended
pearls
then
through
a
close
and
dim
lit
only
by
a
few
flickering
placed
at
far
intervals
then
on
they
went
till
at
last
ascending
three
red
granite
steps
on
which
were
carved
some
curious
hieroglyphs
they
plunged
into
what
seemed
to
be
a
vast
jungle
enclosed
in
some
dense
tropical
forest
what
a
strange
unsightly
thicket
of
rank
verdure
was
here
thought
theos
it
was
as
though
nature
grown
tired
of
floral
beauty
had
in
a
sudden
malevolent
mood
purposely
torn
and
blurred
the
fair
green
frondage
and
twisted
every
bud
awry
great
jagged
leaves
covered
with
prickles
and
stained
all
over
with
blotches
as
of
spilt
poison
thick
brown
stems
glistening
with
slimy
moisture
and
coiled
up
like
the
sleeping
bodies
of
snakes
masses
of
purple
and
blue
fungi
and
blossoms
seemingly
of
the
orchid
species
some
like
fleshy
tongues
others
like
the
waxen
yellow
fingers
of
a
dead
hand
protruded
spectrally
through
the
matted
foliage
while
all
manner
of
strange
overpowering
odors
increased
the
swooning
oppressiveness
of
the
sultry
languorous
air
this
uncouth
botanical
garden
was
apparently
roofed
in
by
a
lofty
glass
dome
decorated
with
hangings
of
silk
but
the
grotesque
trees
and
plants
grew
to
so
enormous
a
height
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
which
were
the
falling
draperies
and
which
the
straggling
leaves
curious
birds
flew
hither
and
thither
voiceless
creatures
scarlet
and
amber
winged
a
huge
gilded
brazier
stood
in
one
corner
from
whence
ascended
the
constant
smoke
of
burning
incense
and
there
were
lamps
all
about
that
shed
a
subdued
mysterious
lustre
on
the
scene
and
bestowed
a
pale
glitter
on
a
few
fantastic
clumps
of
arums
and
nodding
that
lazily
lifted
themselves
out
of
a
greenish
pool
of
stagnant
water
sunk
deeply
in
on
one
side
of
the
marble
flooring
theos
holding
arm
stepped
eagerly
across
the
threshold
he
was
brimful
of
expectation
and
what
mattered
it
to
him
whether
the
things
that
grew
in
this
strange
pavilion
were
pure
or
poisonous
provided
he
might
look
once
more
upon
the
witching
face
that
long
ago
had
so
sweetly
enticed
him
to
his
ruin
stay
what
was
he
thinking
of
long
ago
nay
that
was
impossible
since
he
had
only
seen
the
priestess
lysia
for
the
first
time
that
very
morning
how
piteously
perplexing
it
was
to
be
thus
tormented
with
these
indistinct
ideas
these
notions
of
previous
intimate
acquaintance
with
persons
and
places
he
never
could
have
known
before
all
at
once
he
drew
back
with
a
startled
exclamation
an
enormous
tigress
sleek
and
bounded
up
from
beneath
a
tangled
mass
of
red
and
yellow
creepers
and
advanced
toward
him
with
a
low
savage
snarl
peace
aizif
peace
said
carelessly
patting
the
head
thou
art
wont
to
be
wiser
in
distinguishing
thy
friends
and
foes
then
turning
to
theos
he
added
she
is
harmless
as
a
kitten
this
poor
aizif
call
her
good
theos
she
will
come
to
thy
hand
see
and
he
smiled
as
theos
not
to
be
outdone
by
his
companion
in
physical
courage
bent
forward
and
stroked
the
beast
who
while
submitting
to
his
caress
never
for
a
moment
ceased
her
smothered
snarling
presently
however
she
was
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
savage
playfulness
and
throwing
herself
on
the
ground
before
him
she
rolled
her
lithe
body
to
and
fro
with
brief
thirsty
roars
of
satisfaction
roars
that
echoed
through
the
whole
pavilion
with
terrific
resonance
then
rising
she
shook
herself
vigorously
and
commenced
a
stealthy
pacing
up
and
down
lashing
her
tail
from
side
to
side
and
keeping
those
sly
eyes
of
hers
watchfully
fixed
on
who
merely
laughed
at
her
fierce
antics
leaning
against
one
of
the
dark
gnarled
trees
he
tapped
his
sandaled
foot
with
some
impatience
on
the
marble
pavement
while
theos
standing
close
beside
him
wondered
whether
the
mysterious
lysia
knew
of
their
arrival
appeared
to
guess
his
thoughts
for
he
answered
them
as
though
they
had
been
spoken
aloud
yes
he
said
she
knows
we
are
here
she
knew
the
instant
we
entered
her
gates
nothing
is
or
can
be
hidden
from
her
he
who
would
have
secrets
must
depart
out
of
and
find
some
other
city
to
dwell
in
for
here
he
shall
be
unable
to
keep
even
his
own
counsel
to
lysia
all
things
are
made
manifest
she
reads
human
nature
as
one
reads
an
open
scroll
and
with
merciless
analysis
she
judges
men
as
being
very
poor
creatures
limited
in
their
capabilities
disappointing
and
monotonous
in
their
passions
unproductive
and
circumscribed
in
their
destinies
to
her
ironical
humor
and
icy
wit
the
wisest
sages
seem
fools
she
probes
them
to
the
core
and
discovers
all
their
weaknesses
she
has
no
trust
in
virtue
no
belief
in
honesty
and
she
is
right
who
but
a
madman
would
be
honest
in
these
days
of
competition
and
greed
of
gain
and
as
for
virtue
is
a
pretty
icicle
that
melts
at
the
first
touch
of
a
hot
temptation
aye
the
virgin
priestess
of
nagaya
hath
a
most
profound
comprehension
of
mankind
immeasurable
brute
stupidity
and
strong
in
this
knowledge
she
governs
the
multitude
with
iron
will
intellectual
force
and
dictative
firmness
when
she
dies
i
know
not
what
will
happen
here
he
interrupted
himself
and
a
dark
shadow
crossed
his
brows
by
my
soul
he
muttered
how
this
thought
of
death
haunts
me
like
the
unburied
corpse
of
a
slain
foe
i
would
there
were
no
such
thing
as
death
is
a
cruel
and
wanton
sport
of
the
gods
to
give
us
life
at
all
if
life
must
end
so
utterly
and
so
soon
he
sighed
deeply
theos
echoed
the
sigh
but
answered
nothing
at
that
moment
the
restless
aizif
gave
another
appalling
roar
and
pounced
swiftly
toward
the
eastern
side
of
the
pavilion
where
a
large
painted
panel
could
be
dimly
discerned
the
subject
of
the
painting
being
a
hideous
idol
whose
long
inscrutable
eyes
leered
through
the
surrounding
foliage
with
an
expression
of
hateful
cunning
and
malevolence
in
front
of
this
panel
the
tigress
lay
down
licking
the
pavement
thirstily
from
time
to
time
and
giving
vent
to
short
purring
sounds
of
impatience
then
all
suddenly
she
rose
with
ears
pricked
in
an
attitude
of
attention
the
panel
slowly
moved
it
glided
back
and
the
great
brute
leaped
forward
flinging
her
two
soft
paws
on
the
shoulders
of
the
figure
that
appeared
the
figure
of
a
woman
who
clad
in
glistening
gold
from
head
to
foot
shone
in
the
dark
aperture
like
a
gilded
image
in
a
shrine
of
ebony
theos
beheld
the
brilliant
apparition
in
some
doubt
and
wonder
was
this
lysia
he
could
not
see
her
face
as
she
wore
a
thick
white
veil
through
which
only
the
faintest
sparkle
of
dark
eyes
glimmered
like
flickering
sunbeams
nor
was
he
able
to
discern
the
actual
outline
of
her
form
as
it
was
completely
enveloped
and
lost
in
the
wide
shapeless
folds
of
her
stiff
golden
gown
yet
every
nerve
in
his
body
thrilled
at
her
presence
every
drop
of
blood
seemed
to
rush
from
his
heart
to
his
brain
in
a
swift
scorching
torrent
that
for
a
second
blinded
his
eyes
with
a
red
glare
and
made
him
faint
and
giddy
woman
and
tigress
they
looked
strangely
alike
he
thought
as
they
stood
mutually
caressing
each
other
under
the
great
drooping
masses
of
fantastic
leaves
yet
where
was
the
resemblance
what
possible
similarity
could
there
be
between
a
tawny
treacherous
brute
of
the
forests
full
of
sly
malice
and
voracious
cruelty
and
that
dazzling
creature
whose
small
white
hand
flashing
with
jewels
now
tenderly
smoothed
the
black
silken
stripes
on
the
sleek
coat
of
her
savage
favorite
down
sweet
aizif
down
she
said
in
a
grave
dulcet
voice
as
softly
languorous
as
the
last
note
of
a
down
my
gentle
one
thou
art
too
fond
down
so
this
as
the
tigress
instantly
removed
its
embracing
paws
from
her
neck
and
trembling
in
every
limb
crouched
on
the
ground
in
abjectly
submissive
obedience
another
moment
and
she
advanced
leisurely
into
the
pavilion
aizif
slinking
stealthily
along
beside
her
and
seeming
to
imitate
her
graceful
gliding
movements
till
she
stood
within
a
few
paces
of
theos
and
just
near
the
spot
where
the
swayed
over
the
stagnant
pool
there
she
paused
and
apparently
scrutinized
her
visitors
intently
through
the
folds
of
her
snowy
veil
bent
his
head
before
her
in
a
half
haughty
half
humble
salutation
the
tardy
she
said
with
an
undercurrent
of
laughter
in
her
musical
tones
the
poet
who
loves
the
flattery
of
a
foolish
king
and
the
applause
of
a
still
more
foolish
court
and
so
khosrul
disturbed
the
flood
of
thine
inspiration
good
minstrel
nay
for
that
he
should
die
if
for
no
other
crime
and
this
here
she
turned
her
veiled
features
toward
theos
whose
heart
beat
furiously
as
he
caught
a
luminous
flash
from
those
brilliant
eyes
this
is
the
unwitting
stranger
who
honored
me
by
so
daring
a
scrutiny
this
morning
verily
thou
hast
a
singularly
venturesome
spirit
of
thine
own
fair
sir
still
we
must
honor
courage
even
though
it
border
on
rashness
and
i
rejoice
to
see
that
the
wrathful
mob
of
hath
yet
left
thee
man
enough
to
deserve
my
welcome
nevertheless
thou
were
guilty
of
most
heinous
presumption
here
she
extended
her
jewelled
hand
art
thou
repentant
and
wilt
thou
sue
for
pardon
scarcely
conscious
of
what
he
did
theos
approached
her
and
kneeling
on
one
knee
took
that
fair
soft
hand
in
his
own
and
kissed
it
with
passionate
fervor
criminal
as
i
am
he
murmured
tremulously
i
glory
in
my
crime
nor
will
i
seek
forgiveness
nay
rather
will
i
plead
with
thee
that
i
may
sin
so
sweet
a
sin
again
and
blind
myself
with
beauty
unreproved
slowly
she
withdrew
her
fingers
from
his
clasp
thou
art
bold
she
said
with
a
touch
of
indolent
amusement
in
her
accents
but
in
thy
boldness
there
is
something
of
the
hero
knowest
thou
not
that
i
lysia
high
priestess
of
nagaya
could
have
thee
straightway
slain
for
that
unwise
speech
of
thine
unwise
because
and
somewhat
yes
i
could
have
thee
slain
and
she
laughed
a
rippling
little
laugh
like
that
of
a
pleased
child
howbeit
thou
shalt
not
die
this
time
for
thy
foolhardiness
thy
looks
are
too
much
in
thy
favor
thou
art
like
in
his
noblest
moods
when
tired
of
and
he
condescends
to
remember
that
he
is
not
quite
divine
see
how
he
chafes
at
that
and
plucking
a
she
threw
it
playfully
at
the
laureate
whose
handsome
face
flushed
vexedly
at
her
words
and
thou
art
prudent
sir
theos
do
i
not
pronounce
thy
name
aptly
thou
wilt
be
less
petulant
than
he
and
less
absorbed
in
for
here
men
even
poets
are
deemed
no
more
than
men
and
their
constant
querulous
claim
to
be
considered
as
meets
with
no
acceptance
wilt
thyself
with
beauty
as
thou
well
then
lose
thine
eyes
but
guard
thy
heart
and
with
a
careless
movement
she
loosened
her
veil
it
fell
from
her
like
a
soft
cloud
and
theos
springing
to
his
feet
gazed
upon
her
with
a
sense
of
enraptured
bewilderment
and
passionate
pain
it
was
as
though
he
saw
the
wraith
of
some
fair
dead
woman
he
had
loved
of
old
risen
anew
to
redemand
from
him
his
former
allegiance
o
unfamiliar
yet
face
o
slumbrous
starry
eyes
that
seemed
to
hold
the
memory
of
a
thousand
o
sweet
curved
lips
whereon
a
delicious
smile
rested
as
softly
as
sunlight
on
young
where
where
in
god
name
had
he
seen
all
this
marvelous
witching
maddening
loveliness
before
his
heart
beat
with
heavy
laboring
thuds
his
brain
reeled
a
dim
golden
suffused
radiance
seemed
to
hover
like
an
aureole
above
that
dazzling
white
brow
adorned
with
a
clustering
wealth
of
tresses
whose
massive
coils
were
crowned
with
the
strangest
sort
of
diadem
a
wreath
of
small
serpents
heads
cunningly
fashioned
in
rubies
and
rose
brilliants
and
set
in
such
a
manner
that
they
appeared
to
lift
themselves
erect
from
out
the
dusky
hair
as
though
in
darting
readiness
to
sting
full
of
a
vague
wild
longing
he
instinctively
stretched
out
his
arms
then
on
a
sudden
impulse
turned
swiftly
away
in
a
dizzy
effort
to
escape
from
the
basilisk
of
those
sombre
haunting
eyes
that
plunged
into
his
inmost
soul
and
there
aroused
such
dark
desires
such
retrospective
evil
such
wild
weakness
as
shamed
the
betterness
of
his
nature
clear
mocking
laugh
just
then
rang
sharply
through
the
perfumed
stillness
thou
mad
theos
whither
art
thou
bound
cried
the
laureate
mirthfully
wilt
leave
our
noble
hostess
ere
the
entertainment
has
begun
ungallant
barbarian
what
frenzy
possesses
thee
these
words
recalled
him
to
himself
he
came
back
slowly
step
by
step
and
with
bowed
head
to
where
lysia
stood
lysia
whose
penetrating
gaze
still
rested
upon
him
with
strangely
fixed
intensity
forgive
me
he
said
in
a
low
unsteady
voice
that
to
his
own
ears
sounded
full
of
suppressed
yet
passionate
appeal
forgive
me
lady
that
for
one
moment
i
have
seemed
discourteous
i
am
not
so
in
very
truth
sad
fancies
fret
my
brain
at
times
and
and
there
is
that
within
thine
unveiled
beauty
which
wounds
my
soul
i
am
not
joyous
natured
unlike
chosen
favorite
of
fortune
i
have
lost
all
all
that
made
my
life
once
seem
fair
i
am
dead
to
those
that
loved
me
forgotten
by
those
that
honored
me
a
wanderer
in
strange
lands
a
solitary
wayfarer
perplexed
with
many
griefs
to
which
i
can
not
give
a
name
nevertheless
and
he
drew
a
quick
hard
breath
if
i
may
serve
thee
fairest
lysia
as
serves
thee
subject
to
thy
sovereign
favor
thou
shalt
not
find
me
lacking
in
obedience
command
me
as
thou
wilt
let
me
efface
myself
to
worship
thee
let
me
if
it
be
possible
drown
thought
slay
memory
murder
conscience
so
that
i
may
once
more
as
in
the
old
time
be
glad
with
the
gladness
that
only
love
can
give
and
only
death
can
take
away
as
he
finished
this
unpremeditated
uncontrollable
outburst
his
eyes
wistfully
sought
hers
she
met
his
look
with
a
languid
indifference
and
a
smile
enough
restrain
thine
ardor
she
said
coldly
her
dark
dilating
orbs
shining
like
steel
beneath
the
velvet
softness
of
her
long
lashes
thou
dost
speak
ignorantly
unknowing
what
thy
words
involve
words
to
which
i
well
might
bind
thee
were
i
less
forbearing
to
thine
inconsiderate
rashness
how
like
all
men
thou
art
how
keen
to
plunge
into
unfathomed
deeps
merely
to
snatch
the
pearl
of
present
pleasure
how
in
thy
fancied
sufferings
as
though
thy
little
wave
of
personal
sorrow
swamped
the
world
o
wondrous
human
egotism
that
sees
but
one
great
absolute
scrawled
on
the
face
of
nature
am
afflicted
let
none
dare
to
rejoice
would
be
glad
let
none
presume
to
grieve
she
laughed
a
little
low
laugh
of
icy
satire
and
then
resumed
i
thank
thee
for
thy
proffered
service
sir
stranger
albeit
i
need
it
not
nor
do
i
care
to
claim
it
at
thy
hands
thou
art
my
guest
no
more
whether
thou
wilt
hereafter
deserve
to
be
enrolled
my
bondsman
depends
upon
thy
prowess
and
my
humor
her
beautiful
eyes
flashed
scornfully
and
there
was
something
cruel
in
her
glance
theos
felt
it
sting
him
like
a
sharp
blow
his
nerves
quivered
his
spirit
rose
in
arms
against
the
cynical
hauteur
of
this
woman
whom
he
loved
yes
loved
with
a
curious
sense
of
revived
passion
passion
that
seemed
to
have
slept
in
a
tomb
for
ages
and
that
now
suddenly
sprang
into
life
and
being
like
a
fire
kindled
anew
on
dead
ashes
acting
on
a
sudden
proud
impulse
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
with
a
bold
steadfastness
a
critical
scrutiny
a
calmly
discriminating
valuation
of
her
physical
charms
that
for
the
moment
certainly
appeared
to
startle
her
for
a
deep
flush
colored
the
fairness
of
her
face
and
then
faded
leaving
her
pale
as
marble
her
emotion
whatever
it
was
lasted
but
a
second
yet
in
that
second
he
had
measured
his
mental
strength
against
hers
and
had
become
aware
of
his
own
supremacy
this
consciousness
filled
him
with
peculiar
satisfaction
he
drew
a
long
breath
like
one
narrowly
escaped
from
close
peril
he
had
now
no
fear
of
her
only
a
great
love
and
to
that
he
was
recklessly
content
to
yield
her
eyes
dwelt
glitteringly
first
upon
him
and
then
on
as
the
eyes
of
a
falcon
dwell
on
its
prey
and
her
smile
was
touched
with
a
little
malice
as
she
said
addressing
them
both
come
fair
sirs
we
will
not
linger
in
this
wilderness
of
wild
flowers
a
feast
awaits
us
yonder
a
feast
prepared
for
those
who
like
yourselves
obey
the
creed
of
sweet
self
indulgence
the
creed
wherein
men
find
no
fault
no
shadow
of
inconsistency
the
truest
wisdom
is
to
enjoy
the
only
philosophy
that
which
teaches
us
how
best
to
gratify
our
own
desires
delight
can
not
satiate
the
soul
nor
mirth
engender
weariness
follow
me
and
with
a
lithe
movement
she
swept
toward
the
door
her
pet
tigress
creeping
closely
after
her
then
suddenly
looking
back
she
darted
a
lustiously
caressing
glance
over
her
shoulder
at
and
stretched
out
her
hand
he
at
once
caught
it
in
his
own
and
kissed
it
with
an
almost
brusque
eagerness
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
me
he
murmured
in
a
vexed
tone
forgotten
you
forgotten
impossible
and
her
silvery
laughter
shook
the
air
into
little
throbs
of
music
when
the
greatest
poet
of
the
age
is
forgotten
then
fall
for
there
shall
be
no
more
need
of
kingdoms
laughing
still
and
allowing
her
hand
to
remain
in
his
she
passed
out
of
the
pavilion
and
theos
followed
them
both
as
a
man
might
follow
the
beckoning
sylphs
in
a
fairy
dream
a
mellow
luminous
radiance
seemed
to
surround
them
as
they
went
two
dazzling
figures
gliding
on
before
him
with
the
slow
light
grace
of
moonbeams
flitting
over
a
smooth
ocean
they
seemed
made
for
each
other
he
could
not
separate
them
in
his
thoughts
but
the
strangest
part
of
the
matter
was
the
feeling
he
had
that
he
himself
somehow
belonged
to
them
and
they
to
him
his
ideas
on
the
subject
however
were
very
indefinite
he
was
in
a
condition
of
more
or
less
absolute
passiveness
save
when
strong
shudders
of
grief
memory
remorse
or
roused
passion
shook
him
with
sudden
force
like
a
storm
blast
shaking
some
melancholy
cypress
whose
roots
are
in
the
grave
he
mused
on
lysia
scornful
words
with
a
perplexed
pain
was
he
then
so
selfish
the
one
great
absolute
scrawled
on
the
face
of
nature
could
that
apply
to
him
surely
not
since
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
could
hardly
lay
claim
to
any
distinct
personality
seeing
that
that
personality
was
forever
merging
itself
and
getting
lost
in
the
more
clearly
perfect
identity
of
whom
he
regarded
with
a
species
of
profound
such
as
one
man
seldom
feels
for
another
to
call
himself
a
poet
now
seemed
the
acme
of
absurdity
how
should
such
an
one
as
he
attempt
to
conquer
fame
with
a
rival
like
already
in
the
field
and
already
supremely
victorious
full
of
these
fancies
he
scarcely
heeded
the
wonders
through
which
he
passed
as
he
followed
his
two
radiant
guides
along
his
eyes
were
tired
and
rested
almost
indifferently
on
the
magnificence
that
everywhere
surrounded
him
though
here
and
there
certain
objects
attracted
his
attention
as
being
curiously
familiar
these
lofty
corridors
gorgeously
frescoed
these
splendid
groups
of
statuary
these
nooks
of
verdure
where
imprisoned
nightingales
warbled
plaintive
songs
that
were
all
the
sweeter
for
their
sadness
these
spacious
marble
loggias
cooled
by
the
rising
and
falling
spray
of
myriad
fountains
did
he
not
dimly
recognize
all
these
things
he
thought
so
yet
was
not
sure
for
he
had
arrived
at
a
pass
when
he
could
neither
rely
on
his
reason
nor
his
memory
naught
of
deeper
humiliation
could
he
have
than
this
to
feel
within
himself
that
he
was
still
an
intellectual
thinking
sentient
human
being
and
that
yet
at
the
same
time
his
intelligence
could
do
nothing
to
extricate
him
from
the
terrific
mystery
which
had
engulfed
him
like
a
huge
flood
and
wherein
he
was
now
tossed
to
and
fro
as
helplessly
as
a
floating
straw
on
still
on
he
went
treading
closely
in
footsteps
and
wistfully
noting
how
often
the
head
of
his
friend
drooped
caressingly
toward
lysia
dusky
perfumed
locks
whence
those
jewelled
serpents
fangs
darted
flashingly
upward
like
light
from
darkness
on
still
on
till
at
last
he
found
himself
in
a
grand
vestibule
built
entirely
of
sparkling
red
granite
here
were
ten
sphinxes
so
huge
in
form
that
a
dozen
men
might
have
lounged
at
ease
on
each
one
of
their
enormous
paws
they
were
ranged
in
rows
of
five
on
each
side
and
their
coldly
meditative
eyes
appeared
to
dwell
steadfastly
on
the
polished
face
of
a
large
black
disc
placed
conspicuously
on
a
pedestal
in
the
exact
centre
of
the
pavement
strange
letters
shone
from
time
to
time
on
this
ebony
tablet
letters
that
seemed
to
be
written
in
quicksilver
they
glittered
for
a
second
then
ran
off
like
phosphorescent
drops
of
water
and
again
reappeared
but
the
same
signs
were
never
repeated
twice
over
all
were
different
all
were
rapid
in
their
coming
and
going
as
flashes
of
lightning
lysia
approaching
the
disc
turned
it
slightly
at
her
touch
it
revolved
like
a
flying
wheel
and
for
a
brief
space
was
literally
covered
with
mysterious
characters
which
the
beautiful
priestess
perused
with
an
apparent
air
of
satisfaction
all
at
once
the
fiery
writing
vanished
the
disc
was
left
black
and
bare
and
then
a
silver
ball
fell
suddenly
upon
it
with
a
clang
from
some
unseen
height
and
rolling
off
again
instantly
disappeared
at
the
same
moment
a
harsh
voice
rising
as
it
were
from
the
deepest
underground
chanted
the
following
words
in
a
monotonous
recitative
fall
o
thou
lost
hour
into
the
dreadful
past
sink
o
thou
pearl
of
time
into
the
dark
and
fathomless
abyss
not
all
the
glory
of
kings
or
the
wealth
of
empires
can
purchase
thee
back
again
not
all
the
strength
of
warriors
or
the
wisdom
of
sages
can
draw
thee
forth
from
the
abode
of
silence
whither
thou
art
fled
farewell
lost
hour
and
may
the
gods
defend
us
from
thy
reproach
at
the
day
of
doom
in
the
name
of
the
sun
and
nagaya
peace
the
voice
died
away
in
a
muffled
echo
and
the
slow
solemn
boom
of
a
bell
struck
midnight
then
theos
raising
his
eyes
saw
that
all
further
progress
was
impeded
by
a
great
wall
of
solid
rock
that
glistened
at
every
point
with
flashes
of
pale
and
dark
violet
light
a
wall
composed
entirely
of
adamantine
spar
crusted
thick
with
the
rough
growth
of
oriental
amethyst
it
rose
sheer
up
from
the
ground
to
an
altitude
of
about
a
hundred
feet
and
apparently
closed
in
and
completed
the
vestibule
surely
there
was
no
passing
through
such
a
barrier
as
this
he
thought
wonderingly
nevertheless
lysia
and
still
went
on
and
he
as
perforce
he
was
compelled
still
followed
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
huge
erection
that
towered
above
him
like
a
steep
cliff
of
molten
gems
he
fancied
he
heard
a
faint
sound
behind
it
as
of
clinking
glasses
and
boisterous
laughter
but
before
he
had
time
to
consider
what
this
might
mean
lysia
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
a
small
protruding
knob
of
crystal
pressed
it
and
lo
the
whole
massive
structure
yawned
open
suddenly
without
any
noise
suspending
itself
as
it
were
in
sparkling
festoons
of
purple
stalactites
over
the
voluptuously
magnificent
scene
disclosed
at
first
it
was
difficult
to
discern
more
than
a
gorgeous
maze
of
swaying
light
and
color
as
though
a
great
field
of
tulips
in
full
bloom
should
be
seen
waving
to
and
fro
in
the
breath
of
a
soft
wind
but
gradually
this
bewildering
dazzle
of
gold
and
green
violet
and
crimson
resolved
itself
into
definite
form
and
substance
and
theos
standing
beside
his
two
companions
on
the
elevated
threshold
of
the
partition
through
which
they
had
entered
was
able
to
look
down
and
survey
with
tolerable
composure
the
wondrous
details
of
the
glittering
picture
a
picture
that
looked
like
a
poised
in
a
haze
of
radiance
as
of
vaporized
sapphire
he
saw
beneath
him
a
vast
circular
hall
or
amphitheatre
roofed
in
by
a
lofty
dome
of
richest
malachite
from
the
centre
of
which
was
suspended
a
huge
globe
of
fire
that
revolved
with
incredible
swiftness
flinging
vivid
rays
on
the
silken
carpets
and
embroideries
that
strewed
the
floor
below
the
dome
was
supported
by
rows
upon
rows
of
tall
tapering
crystal
columns
clear
as
translucent
water
and
green
as
the
grass
in
spring
and
between
and
beyond
these
columns
on
the
side
there
were
large
casements
set
wide
open
to
the
night
through
which
the
gleam
of
a
broad
lake
laden
with
could
be
seen
shimmering
in
the
yellow
moon
the
middle
of
the
hall
was
occupied
by
a
round
table
covered
with
draperies
of
gold
white
and
green
and
heaped
with
all
the
costly
accessories
of
a
sumptuous
banquet
such
as
might
have
been
spread
before
the
gods
of
olympus
in
the
full
height
of
their
legendary
prime
here
were
the
lovely
hues
of
fruit
the
tender
bloom
of
scattered
flowers
the
glisten
of
jewelled
flagons
and
goblets
the
flash
of
massive
golden
dishes
carried
aloft
by
black
slaves
attired
in
white
and
crimson
the
red
glow
of
wine
and
here
in
the
drowsy
warmth
lounging
on
divans
of
velvet
and
embroidered
satin
eating
drinking
idly
gossiping
loudly
laughing
and
occasionally
bursting
into
wild
snatches
of
song
were
a
company
of
personages
all
men
all
young
all
handsome
all
richly
clad
and
all
evidently
bent
on
enjoying
the
pleasures
offered
by
the
immediate
hour
suddenly
however
their
noisy
voices
ceased
with
one
accord
as
though
drawn
by
some
magnetic
spell
they
all
turned
their
heads
toward
the
platform
where
lysia
had
just
silently
made
her
appearance
and
springing
from
their
seats
they
broke
into
a
boisterous
shout
of
acclamation
and
welcome
one
young
man
whose
flushed
face
had
all
the
joyous
wanton
effeminate
beauty
of
a
pictured
dionysius
reeled
forward
goblet
in
hand
and
tossing
the
wine
in
air
so
that
it
splashed
down
again
at
his
feet
staining
his
white
garments
as
it
fell
with
a
stain
as
of
blood
he
cried
tipsily
all
hail
lysia
where
hast
thou
wandered
so
long
thou
goddess
of
morn
we
have
been
lost
in
the
blackness
of
night
sunk
in
the
depths
of
a
gloom
but
lo
now
the
clouds
have
broken
in
the
east
and
our
hearts
rejoice
at
the
birth
of
day
vanish
dull
moon
and
be
ashamed
for
a
fairer
planet
rules
the
sky
hence
ye
stars
puny
lazily
crawling
in
the
fields
of
ether
lysia
invests
the
heaven
and
earth
and
in
her
smile
we
live
ha
art
thou
there
come
praise
me
for
my
improvised
they
are
as
good
as
thine
i
warrant
thee
canst
compose
when
thou
art
drunk
my
dainty
laureate
drain
a
cup
then
and
string
me
a
stanza
where
is
thy
fool
zebastes
i
would
fain
tickle
his
long
ears
with
ribald
rhyme
and
hearken
to
the
barbarous
braying
forth
of
his
asinine
reflections
lysia
what
lysia
dost
thou
frown
at
me
frown
not
sweet
queen
but
rather
laugh
thy
laughter
kills
is
true
but
thy
frown
doth
torture
spirits
after
death
unbend
thy
brows
night
looms
between
them
like
a
chaos
we
will
have
no
more
night
i
say
but
only
noon
a
long
languorous
lovely
noon
and
roses
roses
roses
crown
my
head
for
my
days
are
few
and
remember
sweet
when
i
am
dead
that
my
heart
was
true
singing
unsteadily
with
the
empty
goblet
in
his
hand
he
looked
up
laughing
his
bright
eyes
flashing
with
a
wild
feverish
fire
his
fair
hair
tossed
back
from
his
brows
and
entangled
in
a
wreath
of
his
rich
garments
disordered
his
whole
demeanor
that
of
one
possessed
by
a
of
sensuous
pleasure
when
all
at
once
meeting
lysia
keen
glance
he
started
as
though
he
had
been
suddenly
stabbed
the
goblet
fell
from
his
clasp
and
a
visible
shudder
ran
through
his
strong
supple
frame
the
low
cold
merciless
laughter
of
the
beautiful
priestess
cut
through
the
air
hissingly
like
the
sweep
of
a
scimetar
thou
art
wondrous
merry
she
said
in
languid
lazily
enunciated
accents
knowest
thou
not
that
too
much
mirth
engenders
weeping
and
that
excessive
rejoicing
hath
its
fitting
end
in
grievous
lamentation
nay
even
now
already
thou
lookest
more
sadly
what
sombre
cloud
has
crossed
thy
heaven
be
happy
while
thou
mayest
good
fool
i
blame
thee
not
sooner
or
later
all
things
must
end
in
the
mean
time
make
thou
the
most
of
life
while
life
remains
at
its
best
an
uncertain
heritage
that
once
rashly
squandered
can
never
be
restored
either
here
or
hereafter
the
words
were
gently
almost
tenderly
spoken
but
hearing
them
grew
white
as
death
his
smile
faded
leaving
his
lips
set
and
stern
as
the
lips
of
a
marble
mask
stooping
he
raised
his
fallen
goblet
and
held
it
out
almost
mechanically
to
a
passing
slave
who
it
with
wine
which
he
drank
off
thirstily
at
a
draught
though
the
generous
liquid
brought
no
color
back
to
his
drawn
and
ashy
features
lysia
paid
no
further
heed
to
his
evident
discomfiture
bidding
and
theos
follow
her
she
descended
the
few
steps
that
led
from
the
raised
platform
into
the
body
of
the
brilliant
hall
the
rocky
screen
of
amethyst
closed
behind
her
as
noiselessly
as
it
had
opened
and
in
another
moment
she
stood
among
her
assembled
guests
who
at
once
surrounded
her
with
eager
salutations
and
gracefully
worded
flatteries
smiling
on
them
all
with
that
strange
smile
of
hers
that
was
more
scornful
than
sweet
and
yet
so
infinitely
bewitching
she
said
little
in
answer
to
their
greetings
she
moved
as
a
queen
moves
through
a
crowd
of
courtiers
the
varied
light
of
crimson
and
green
playing
about
her
like
so
many
sparkles
of
living
flame
her
dark
head
wreathed
with
those
jewelled
serpents
lifting
itself
proudly
erect
from
her
muffling
golden
mantle
and
her
eyes
shining
with
that
frosty
gleam
of
mockery
which
made
them
look
so
lustrous
yet
so
cold
and
now
theos
perceived
that
at
one
end
of
the
splendid
banquet
table
a
dais
was
erected
draped
richly
in
silk
and
that
on
this
dais
a
throne
was
placed
a
throne
composed
entirely
of
black
crystals
whose
points
sparkled
with
a
dark
flash
as
of
bayonets
seen
through
the
smoke
of
battle
it
was
cushioned
in
black
velvet
and
above
it
was
a
bent
arch
of
ivory
on
which
glittered
a
twisted
snake
of
clustered
emeralds
with
that
slow
superb
ease
that
distinguished
all
her
actions
lysia
attended
closely
by
her
tigress
mounted
the
dais
and
as
she
did
so
a
loud
clash
of
brazen
bells
rang
out
from
some
invisible
turret
beyond
the
summit
of
the
great
dome
at
the
sound
of
the
jangling
chime
four
negresses
appeared
goblin
creatures
that
looked
as
though
they
had
suddenly
sprung
from
some
sooty
subterranean
region
of
gnomes
and
humbly
prostrating
themselves
before
lysia
kissed
the
ground
at
her
feet
this
done
they
rose
and
began
to
undo
the
fastenings
of
her
golden
garment
but
either
they
were
slow
or
the
fair
priestess
was
impatient
for
she
suddenly
shook
herself
free
of
their
hands
and
loosening
the
gorgeous
mantle
herself
from
its
jewelled
clasps
it
fell
slowly
from
her
symmetrical
form
on
the
perfumed
floor
with
a
rustle
as
of
falling
leaves
a
sigh
quivered
audibly
through
the
room
whether
of
grief
joy
hope
relief
or
despair
it
was
difficult
to
tell
the
pride
and
peril
of
a
matchless
loveliness
was
revealed
in
all
its
fatal
seductiveness
and
invincible
strength
the
irresistible
perfection
of
woman
beauty
was
openly
displayed
to
bewilder
the
sight
and
rouse
the
reckless
passions
of
man
who
could
look
on
such
delicate
dangerous
witching
charms
unmoved
who
could
gaze
on
the
exquisite
outlines
of
a
form
fairer
than
that
of
any
sculptured
venus
and
refuse
to
acknowledge
its
powerfully
sweet
attraction
the
virgin
priestess
of
the
sun
had
stepped
out
of
her
shrine
no
longer
a
creature
removed
impersonal
and
sacred
she
had
become
most
absolutely
human
moreover
she
might
now
have
been
taken
for
a
bacchante
a
dancer
or
any
other
unsexed
example
of
womanhood
inasmuch
as
with
her
golden
mantle
she
had
thrown
off
all
disguise
of
modesty
her
beautiful
limbs
rounded
and
smooth
as
pearl
could
be
plainly
discerned
through
the
filmy
garb
of
silvery
tissue
that
clung
like
a
pale
mist
about
the
voluptuous
curves
of
her
figure
and
floated
behind
her
in
shining
gossamer
folds
her
dazzling
white
neck
and
arms
were
bare
and
from
slim
wrist
to
snowy
shoulder
little
twining
diamond
snakes
glistened
in
close
coils
against
the
velvety
fairness
of
her
flesh
a
silver
serpent
with
a
head
of
sapphires
girdled
her
waist
and
just
above
the
full
wave
of
her
bosom
that
rose
and
fell
visibly
beneath
the
transparent
gathers
of
her
gauzy
drapery
shone
a
large
fiery
jewel
fashioned
in
the
semblance
of
a
human
eye
this
singular
ornament
was
so
as
to
be
absolutely
repulsive
and
as
it
moved
to
and
fro
with
its
wearer
breathing
it
seemed
now
to
stare
aghast
anon
to
flash
wickedly
as
with
a
thought
of
evil
while
more
often
still
it
assumed
a
restlessly
watchful
expression
as
though
it
were
the
eye
of
a
intent
on
the
detection
of
some
secret
treachery
poised
between
those
fair
white
breasts
it
glared
forth
a
glittering
menace
a
warning
of
unimaginable
horror
and
theos
gazing
at
it
fixedly
felt
a
curious
thrill
run
through
him
as
if
so
to
speak
a
hook
of
steel
had
been
suddenly
thrust
into
his
quivering
veins
to
draw
him
steadily
and
securely
on
toward
some
pitfall
of
unknown
tortures
then
he
remembered
what
had
said
about
the
eye
the
weird
mirror
and
potent
dazzler
of
human
sight
and
wondered
whether
its
mystical
properties
were
such
as
to
compel
men
to
involuntarily
declare
their
inmost
thoughts
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
its
sinister
glow
penetrated
into
the
very
deepest
recesses
of
his
mind
and
there
discovered
all
the
hidden
weaknesses
follies
and
passions
of
the
worst
side
of
his
nature
he
trembled
and
grew
faint
his
dazed
eyes
wandered
over
the
dainty
grace
and
marvel
of
lysia
almost
unclad
loveliness
with
mingled
emotions
of
allurement
and
repugnance
fascinated
yet
at
the
same
time
repelled
his
soul
yearned
toward
her
as
the
soul
of
the
knight
in
the
legend
yearned
toward
the
singing
whose
embrace
was
destruction
and
then
he
became
filled
with
a
strange
sudden
fear
fear
not
for
himself
but
for
whose
ardent
glance
burned
into
her
dark
amorous
orbs
with
the
lustre
of
flame
meeting
flame
whose
beautiful
flushed
face
was
as
that
of
a
god
inspired
or
lover
triumphant
what
could
he
do
to
shield
and
save
this
so
idolized
friend
of
his
this
dear
familiar
for
whom
he
had
such
close
and
sympathy
might
he
not
possibly
guard
him
in
some
way
and
ward
off
impending
danger
but
what
danger
what
spectral
shadow
of
dread
hovered
above
this
brilliant
scene
of
high
feasting
and
voluptuous
revelry
none
that
he
could
imagine
or
define
and
yet
he
was
conscious
of
an
omimous
unuttered
premonition
of
peril
in
the
very
air
peril
for
always
for
never
for
himself
self
seemed
dead
and
entombed
forever
involuntarily
lifting
his
eyes
to
the
great
green
dome
where
the
globe
of
fire
twirled
rapidly
like
a
rolling
star
he
saw
some
words
written
round
it
in
golden
letters
they
were
large
and
distinct
and
ran
thus
live
in
the
now
but
question
not
the
afterwards
a
wise
axiom
yet
almost
a
platitude
for
did
not
every
one
occupy
themselves
exclusively
with
the
now
regardless
of
future
consequences
of
course
who
but
sages
or
fools
would
stop
to
question
the
afterwards
just
then
lysia
ascended
her
black
crystal
throne
in
all
her
statuesque
majesty
and
sinking
indolently
amid
its
sable
cushions
where
she
shone
in
her
wonderful
whiteness
like
a
glistening
pearl
set
in
ebony
she
signed
to
her
guests
to
resume
their
places
at
table
she
was
instantly
obeyed
took
what
was
evidently
his
accustomed
post
at
her
right
hand
while
theos
found
a
vacant
corner
on
her
left
next
to
the
picturesque
lounging
figure
of
the
young
man
nir
jahs
who
looked
up
at
him
with
a
half
smile
as
he
seated
himself
and
courteously
made
more
room
for
him
among
the
tumbled
emerald
silk
diapers
of
the
luxurious
divan
they
now
shared
together
nir
jahs
was
by
no
means
sober
but
he
had
recovered
a
little
of
his
since
lysia
sleepy
eyes
had
darted
such
cold
contempt
upon
him
and
he
seemed
for
the
present
to
be
on
his
guard
against
giving
any
further
possible
cause
of
offence
thou
art
a
new
comer
a
stranger
if
i
mistake
not
he
inquired
in
a
low
abrupt
yet
kindly
tone
yes
replied
theos
in
the
same
soft
i
am
a
mere
sojourner
in
for
a
few
days
only
the
guest
of
the
divine
raised
his
eyebrows
with
an
expression
of
amused
wonder
divine
he
ejaculated
by
my
faith
what
neophyte
have
we
here
and
supporting
himself
on
one
elbow
he
stared
at
his
companion
as
though
he
saw
in
him
some
singular
human
phenomenon
dost
thou
really
believe
he
went
on
jestingly
in
the
divinity
of
poets
dost
thou
think
they
write
what
they
mean
or
practice
what
they
preach
then
art
thou
the
veriest
innocent
that
ever
wore
the
muscular
semblance
of
man
poets
my
friend
are
the
most
absolute
impostors
they
melodize
their
rhymed
music
on
phases
of
emotion
they
have
never
experienced
as
for
instance
our
lameate
yonder
will
string
a
pretty
sonnet
on
the
despair
of
love
he
knowing
nothing
of
despair
he
will
write
of
a
broken
heart
his
own
being
unpricked
by
so
much
as
a
pin
point
of
trouble
and
he
will
speak
in
his
verso
of
dying
for
love
when
he
would
not
let
his
little
finger
ache
for
the
sake
of
a
woman
who
worshipped
him
look
not
so
vaguely
is
so
indeed
and
as
for
the
divine
part
of
him
wait
but
a
little
and
thou
shalt
see
thy
become
a
satyr
he
laughed
maliciously
and
theos
felt
an
angry
flush
rising
to
his
brows
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
thus
lightly
maligned
even
by
this
reveller
it
stung
him
to
the
quick
as
if
he
personally
were
included
in
the
implied
accusation
of
unworthiness
perceived
his
annoyance
and
added
good
naturedly
tush
man
vex
not
thy
soul
as
to
thy
friend
virtues
or
vices
what
are
they
to
thee
and
of
truth
is
no
worse
than
the
rest
of
us
all
i
maintain
is
that
he
is
certainly
no
better
i
have
known
many
poets
in
my
day
and
they
are
all
more
or
less
alike
petulant
as
babes
peevish
as
women
selfish
as
misers
and
conceited
as
peacocks
they
should
be
different
oh
yes
they
should
be
the
perpetual
youth
of
mankind
the
faithful
singers
of
love
idealized
and
made
perfect
but
then
none
of
us
are
what
we
ought
to
be
besides
if
we
were
all
virtuous
by
the
gods
the
world
would
become
too
dull
a
hole
to
live
in

wilt
drink
with
me
and
beckoning
a
slave
he
had
his
own
goblet
and
that
of
theos
filled
to
the
brim
with
wine
to
our
more
intimate
acquaintance
he
said
smilingly
and
theos
somewhat
captivated
by
the
easy
courtesy
of
his
manner
could
do
no
less
than
respond
cordially
to
the
proffered
toast
at
that
moment
a
triumphant
burst
of
music
like
the
sound
of
mingled
flutes
hautboys
and
harps
pushed
through
the
dome
like
a
strong
wind
sweeping
in
from
the
sea
and
with
it
the
hum
and
buzz
of
conversation
began
in
good
earnest
theos
lifting
his
gaze
toward
lysia
seat
saw
that
she
was
now
surrounded
by
the
four
attendant
negresses
who
standing
two
on
each
side
of
her
throne
held
large
fans
of
peacock
plumes
which
as
they
were
waved
slowly
to
and
fro
emitted
a
thousand
scintillations
of
splendor
a
slave
attired
in
scarlet
knelt
on
one
knee
before
her
proffering
a
golden
salver
loaded
with
the
choicest
fruits
and
wines
a
lazy
smile
played
on
her
lips
lips
that
outrivaled
the
dewy
tint
of
roses
the
serpents
in
her
hair
and
on
her
rounded
arms
quivered
in
the
light
like
living
things
the
great
symbolic
eye
glanced
wickedly
out
from
the
white
beauty
of
her
heaving
breast
and
as
he
surveyed
her
thus
resplendent
in
all
the
startling
seductiveness
of
her
dangerous
charms
her
loveliness
entranced
and
intoxicated
him
like
the
faint
perfume
of
some
rare
and
powerful
exotic
his
senses
seemed
to
sink
drowningly
in
the
whelming
influence
of
her
soft
and
dazzling
grace
and
though
he
still
resented
he
could
not
resist
her
mesmeric
power
no
wonder
he
thought
that
eyes
darkened
with
passions
as
they
dwelt
on
her
and
no
wonder
that
he
like
was
content
to
be
gently
but
surely
drawn
within
the
glittering
web
of
her
magic
spell
a
spell
fatal
yet
too
bewilderingly
sweet
for
human
strength
to
fight
against
the
mysterious
sense
he
had
of
danger
lurking
somewhere
for
applied
so
he
fancied
in
no
way
to
himself
it
did
not
much
matter
what
happened
to
him
he
was
a
mere
nobody
he
could
be
of
no
use
anywhere
he
was
as
one
banished
into
strange
exile
his
brain
that
brain
he
had
once
deemed
so
clear
so
subtle
so
eminently
reasoning
and
was
now
nothing
but
a
chaotic
confusion
of
vague
suggestions
and
only
served
to
very
slightly
guide
him
in
the
immediate
present
giving
him
no
practical
clue
at
all
as
to
the
past
through
which
he
had
lived
or
the
circumstances
he
most
wished
to
remember
he
was
a
fool
a
dreamer
ungifted
unfamous
were
he
to
die
not
a
soul
would
regret
his
loss
his
own
fate
therefore
concerned
him
little
he
could
handle
fire
recklessly
and
not
feel
the
flame
he
could
so
he
believed
run
any
risk
and
yet
escape
comparatively
free
of
harm
but
with
it
was
different
must
be
guarded
and
cherished
his
was
a
valuable
life
the
life
of
a
genius
such
as
the
world
sees
but
once
in
a
century
and
it
should
not
so
theos
determined
be
emperilled
or
wasted
no
not
even
for
the
sake
of
the
sensuous
exquisite
conquering
beauty
of
this
dazzling
priestess
of
the
sun
the
fairest
sorceress
that
ever
triumphed
over
the
frail
yet
immortal
spirit
of
man
chapter

the
love
that
kills
how
the
time
went
he
could
not
tell
in
so
gay
and
gorgeous
a
scene
hours
might
easily
pass
with
the
swiftness
of
unmarked
moments
peals
of
laughter
echoed
now
and
again
through
the
vaulted
dome
and
excited
voices
were
frequently
raised
in
clamorous
disputations
and
contentious
arguments
that
only
just
sheered
off
the
of
an
actual
quarrel
all
sorts
of
topics
were
discussed
the
laws
the
existing
mode
of
government
the
latest
discoveries
in
science
and
the
military
prowess
of
the
king
but
the
conversation
chiefly
turned
on
the
spread
of
disloyalty
atheism
and
republicanism
among
the
population
of
and
the
influence
of
khosrul
on
the
minds
of
the
lower
classes
the
episode
of
the
prophet
late
capture
and
fresh
escape
seemed
to
be
perfectly
well
known
to
all
present
though
it
had
occurred
so
recently
one
would
have
thought
the
detailed
account
of
it
had
been
received
through
some
private
telephone
communicating
with
the
king
palace
as
the
banquet
progressed
and
the
wine
flowed
more
lavishly
the
assembled
guests
grew
less
and
less
circumspect
in
their
general
behavior
they
flung
themselves
full
length
on
their
luxurious
couches
in
the
laziest
attitudes
now
pulling
out
handfuls
of
flowers
from
the
tall
porcelain
jars
that
stood
near
and
pelting
one
another
with
them
for
mere
idle
diversion
now
summoning
the
attendant
slaves
to
refill
their
while
they
lay
lounging
at
ease
among
their
cushions
of
silk
and
embroidery
and
yet
with
all
the
voluptuous
freedom
of
their
manners
the
picturesque
grace
that
distinguished
them
was
never
wholly
destroyed
these
young
men
were
dissolute
but
not
coarse
bold
but
not
vulgar
they
took
their
pleasure
in
a
delicately
wanton
fashion
that
was
infinitely
more
dangerous
in
its
influence
on
the
mind
than
would
have
been
the
gross
mirth
and
broad
jesting
of
a
similar
number
of
uneducated
plebeians
the
rude
licentiousness
of
an
uncultivated
boor
has
its
in
disgust
and
satiety
but
the
soft
enervating
sensualism
of
a
trained
and
cultured
epicurean
aristocrat
is
a
moral
poison
whose
effects
are
so
insidious
as
to
be
scarcely
felt
till
all
the
native
nobility
of
character
has
withered
and
naught
is
left
of
a
man
but
the
of
his
former
self
there
was
nothing
repulsive
in
the
merriment
of
these
patrician
revellers
their
witticisms
were
brilliant
and
pointed
but
never
indelicate
and
if
their
darker
passions
were
roused
and
ready
to
run
riot
they
showed
as
yet
no
sign
of
it
they
enjoyed
yes
with
that
selfish
animal
enjoyment
and
love
of
personal
indulgence
which
all
men
old
and
young
without
exception
take
such
delight
in
unless
indeed
they
be
sworn
and
sorrowful
anchorites
and
even
then
you
may
be
sure
they
are
always
regretting
the
easy
license
and
libertinage
of
their
bygone
days
of
unbridled
independence
when
they
could
foster
their
pet
weaknesses
cherish
their
favorite
vices
and
laugh
at
all
creeds
and
all
morality
as
though
divine
justice
were
a
mere
empty
name
and
they
themselves
the
of
creation
ah
what
a
ridiculous
spectacle
is
man
the
pigmy
of
limited
brain
and
still
more
limited
sympathies
that
standing
arrogantly
on
his
little
grave
the
earth
coolly
criticises
the
universe
settles
law
and
measures
his
puny
stature
against
that
awful
unknown
force
deeply
hidden
but
majestically
existent
which
for
want
of
ampler
designation
we
call
god
god
whom
some
of
us
will
scarcely
recognize
save
with
the
mixture
of
doubt
levity
and
general
reluctance
god
whom
we
never
obey
unless
obedience
is
enforced
by
calamity
god
whom
we
never
truly
love
because
so
many
of
us
prefer
to
stake
our
chances
of
the
future
on
the
possibility
of
his
strangely
enough
thoughts
of
this
god
this
despised
and
forgotten
creator
came
wandering
hazily
over
theos
mind
at
the
present
moment
when
glancing
round
the
splendid
he
studied
the
different
faces
of
all
assembled
and
saw
self
self
self
indelibly
impressed
on
every
one
of
them
not
a
single
countenance
was
there
that
did
not
openly
betray
the
complacent
hauteur
and
tranquil
vanity
of
absolute
egotism
especially
but
then
had
something
to
be
proud
of
his
genius
it
was
natural
that
he
should
be
satisfied
with
himself
he
was
a
great
man
but
was
it
well
for
even
a
great
man
to
admire
his
own
greatness
this
was
a
pertinent
question
and
somewhat
difficult
to
answer
a
genius
must
surely
be
more
or
less
conscious
of
his
superiority
to
those
who
have
no
genius
yet
why
may
it
not
happen
on
occasions
that
the
fool
shall
teach
a
lesson
to
the
wise
man
then
where
is
the
wise
superiority
if
a
fool
can
instruct
him
theos
found
these
suggestions
curiously
puzzling
they
seemed
simple
enough
and
yet
they
opened
up
a
vista
of
intricate
disquisition
which
he
was
in
no
humor
to
follow
to
escape
from
his
own
reflections
he
began
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
conversation
going
on
around
him
and
listened
with
an
eager
almost
painful
interest
whenever
he
heard
lysia
sweet
languid
voice
chiming
through
the
clatter
of
men
tongues
like
the
silver
stroke
of
a
small
bell
ringing
in
a
storm
at
sea
and
how
hast
thou
left
thy
pale
beauty
niphrata
she
was
asking
in
accents
does
her
singing
still
charm
thee
as
of
yore
i
understand
thou
hast
given
her
her
freedom
is
that
prudent
was
she
not
safer
as
thy
slave
glanced
up
quickly
in
surprise
safer
she
is
as
safe
as
a
rose
in
its
green
sheath
he
replied
what
harm
should
come
to
her
i
spoke
not
of
harm
said
lysia
with
a
lazy
smile
but
the
day
may
come
good
minstrel
when
thy
sheathed
rose
may
seek
some
newer
sunshine
than
thy
face
when
thy
much
poesy
may
pall
upon
her
spirit
and
thy
grow
stale
and
she
may
string
her
harp
to
a
different
tune
than
the
perpetual
of
the
handsome
laureate
looked
amused
let
her
do
so
then
he
laughed
carelessly
were
she
to
leave
me
i
should
not
miss
her
greatly
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
will
purchase
me
another
voice
as
sweet
as
hers
another
maid
as
fair
meanwhile
the
child
is
free
to
shape
her
own
fate
her
own
future
i
bind
her
no
longer
to
my
service
nevertheless
like
the
she
clings
and
will
not
easily
unwind
the
tendrils
of
her
heart
from
mine
poor
murmured
lysia
negligently
with
a
touch
of
malice
in
her
tone
what
a
rock
it
doth
embrace
how
little
it
hath
wherein
to
blossom
and
her
drowsy
eyes
shot
forth
a
fiery
glance
from
under
their
heavily
fringed
drooping
white
lids
met
her
look
with
one
of
mingled
vexation
and
reproach
she
smiled
and
raising
a
goblet
of
wine
to
her
lips
kissed
the
brim
and
gave
it
to
him
with
an
indescribably
graceful
swaying
gesture
of
her
whole
form
that
reminded
one
of
a
tall
white
lily
bowing
in
the
breeze
he
seized
the
cup
eagerly
drank
from
it
and
returned
it
his
momentary
annoyance
whatever
it
was
passed
and
a
joyous
elation
illumined
his
fine
features
then
lysia
refilling
the
cup
kissed
it
again
and
handed
it
to
theos
with
so
much
soft
animation
and
tenderness
in
her
face
as
she
turned
to
him
that
his
enforced
calmness
nearly
gave
way
and
he
had
much
ado
to
restrain
himself
from
falling
at
her
feet
in
a
transport
of
passion
and
crying
out
love
me
o
thou
of
beauty
love
me
if
only
for
an
hour
and
then
let
me
die
for
i
shall
have
lived
out
all
the
joys
of
life
in
one
embrace
of
thine
his
hand
trembled
as
he
took
the
goblet
and
he
drank
half
its
contents
thirstily
then
imitating
example
he
returned
it
to
her
with
a
profound
salutation
her
eyes
dwelt
meditatively
upon
him
what
a
dark
still
melancholy
countenance
is
thine
sir
theos
she
said
abruptly
thou
art
for
sure
a
man
of
strongly
repressed
and
concentrated
passions
is
a
nature
i
love
i
would
there
were
more
of
thy
proud
and
chilly
temperament
in
our
men
are
like
butterflies
drinking
honey
all
day
and
drowsing
in
sunshine
full
to
the
brows
of
folly
frail
and
delicate
as
the
little
dancing
maidens
of
the
king
seraglio
nervous
too
with
weak
heads
that
art
apt
to
ache
on
small
provocation
and
bodies
that
are
apt
to
fail
easily
when
but
slightly
fatigued
aye
thou
art
a
man
clothed
complete
in
manliness
moreover
she
paused
and
leaning
forward
so
that
the
dark
shower
of
her
perfumed
hair
brushed
his
arm
hast
ever
heard
travellers
talk
of
volcanoes
those
marvellous
mountains
that
oft
wear
crowns
of
ice
on
their
summits
and
yet
hold
unquenchable
fire
in
their
depths
methinks
thou
dost
resemble
these
and
that
at
a
touch
the
flames
would
leap
forth
uncontrolled
her
magical
low
voice
more
melodious
in
tone
than
the
sound
of
harps
played
by
moonlight
on
the
water
thrilled
in
his
ears
and
set
his
pulses
beating
madly
with
an
effort
he
checked
the
torrent
of
that
rushed
to
his
lips
and
looked
at
her
in
a
sort
of
wildly
wondering
appeal
her
laughter
rang
out
in
silvery
sweet
ripples
and
throwing
herself
lazily
back
in
her
throne
she
aizif
aizif
the
great
tigress
instantly
bounded
forward
like
an
obedient
hound
and
placed
its
on
her
knees
while
she
playfully
held
a
sugared
comfit
high
above
its
head
up
aizif
up
she
cried
up
and
be
like
a
man
for
once
snatch
thy
pleasure
at
all
hazards
with
a
roar
the
savage
brute
leaped
and
sprang
its
sharp
white
teeth
fully
displayed
its
sly
green
eyes
glisteningly
prominent
and
again
lysia
rich
laughter
pealed
forth
mingling
with
the
impatient
snarls
of
her
terrific
favorite
still
she
held
the
tempting
morsel
in
her
little
snowy
hand
that
glittered
all
over
with
rare
gems
and
still
the
tigress
continued
to
make
impotent
attempts
to
reach
it
growing
more
and
more
ferocious
with
every
fresh
effort
till
all
at
once
she
shut
her
palm
upon
the
dainty
so
that
it
could
not
be
seen
and
lightly
catching
the
irritated
beast
by
the
throat
brought
its
eyes
on
a
level
with
her
own
the
effect
was
instantaneous
a
strong
shudder
passed
through
its
frame
and
it
cowered
and
crouched
lower
and
lower
in
abject
fear
the
sweat
broke
out
and
stood
in
large
drops
on
its
sleek
hide
and
panting
heavily
as
the
firm
grasp
its
mistress
slowly
relaxed
it
sank
down
prone
in
trembling
abasement
on
the
second
step
of
the
dais
still
looking
up
into
those
densely
brilliant
gazelle
eyes
that
were
full
of
such
deadly
fascination
and
merciless
tyranny
good
aizif
said
lysia
then
in
that
languid
soft
voice
that
while
so
sweet
suggested
hidden
gentle
fondling
thou
hast
fairly
earned
thy
reward
here
take
it
and
unclosing
her
roseate
palm
she
showed
the
desired
and
offered
it
with
a
pretty
coaxing
air
but
the
tigress
now
refused
to
touch
it
and
lay
as
still
as
an
animal
of
painted
stone
what
a
true
philosopher
she
is
my
sweet
aizif
she
went
on
amusedly
stroking
the
creature
head
her
feminine
wit
teaches
her
what
the
dull
brains
of
men
can
never
grasp
namely
that
pleasures
no
matter
how
sweet
turn
to
ashes
and
wormwood
when
once
obtained
and
that
the
only
happiness
in
this
world
is
the
charm
of
desire
there
is
a
subject
for
thee
write
an
immortal
ode
on
the
mysteries
the
delights
the
ravishment
of
desire
but
carry
not
thy
fancy
on
to
desire
fulfilment
for
there
thou
shalt
find
infinite
bitterness
the
soul
that
wilfully
gratifies
its
dearest
wish
has
stripped
life
of
its
supremest
joy
and
stands
thereafter
in
an
emptied
sphere
sorrowful
and
alone
with
nothing
left
to
hope
for
nothing
to
look
forward
to
save
death
the
end
of
all
ambition
nay
fair
lady
said
theos
suddenly
we
who
deem
ourselves
the
children
of
the
high
gods
and
the
offspring
of
a
spirit
eternal
may
surely
aspire
to
something
beyond
this
death
that
like
a
black
seal
closes
up
the
brief
scroll
of
our
merely
human
existence
and
to
us
therefore
ambition
should
be
ceaseless
for
if
we
master
the
world
there
are
yet
more
worlds
to
win
and
if
we
find
one
heaven
we
do
but
accept
it
as
a
pledge
of
other

beyond
it
the
aspirations
of
man
are
limitless
hence
his
best
assurance
of
immortality
else
why
should
he
perpetually
long
for
things
that
here
are
impossible
of
attainment
things
that
like
faint
floating
clouds
rimmed
with
light
suggest
without
declaring
a
glory
unperceived
lysia
looked
at
him
steadfastly
an
of
malice
shining
in
her
slumbrous
eyes
why
because
good
sir
the
gods
love
mirth
and
the
wanton
immortals
are
never
more
thoroughly
diverted
than
when
leaning
downward
from
their
clear
empyrean
they
behold
man
their
arrogating
to
himself
a
share
in
their
imperishable
essence
to
keep
up
the
eternal
jest
they
torture
him
with
vain
delusions
and
prick
him
on
with
hopes
never
to
be
realized
aye
and
the
whole
vast
heaven
may
well
shake
with
thunderous
laughter
at
the
pride
with
which
he
doth
put
forth
his
puny
claim
to
be
elected
to
another
and
fairer
state
of
existence
what
hath
he
done
what
does
he
do
to
merit
a
future
life
are
his
deeds
so
noble
is
his
wisdom
so
great
is
his
mind
so
stainless
he
the
oppressor
of
all
nature
and
of
his
brother
man
he
the
insolent
tyrant
yet
bound
slave
of
the
earth
on
which
he
dwells
why
should
he
live
again
and
carry
his
ignoble
presence
into
the
splendors
of
an
eternity
too
vast
for
him
to
comprehend
nay
i
perceive
thou
art
one
of
the
credulous
for
whom
a
reasonless
worship
to
an
unproved
deity
is
for
the
sake
of
maintained
i
had
thought
thee
wiser
but
no
matter
thou
shalt
pay
thy
vows
to
the
shrine
of
nagaya
and
see
with
what
glorious
pomp
and
panoply
we
impose
on
the
faithful
who
like
thee
believe
in
their
own
deathless
and
divinely
constituted
natures
and
enjoy
to
the
full
the
grand
conceit
that
persuades
them
of
their
right
to
immortality
her
words
carried
with
them
a
certain
practical
positiveness
of
meaning
and
theos
was
somewhat
impressed
by
their
seeming
truth
after
all
it
was
a
curious
and
unfounded
conceit
of
a
man
to
imagine
himself
the
possessor
of
an
immortal
soul
and
yet
if
all
things
were
the
outcome
of
a
divine
creative
influence
was
it
not
unjust
of
that
creative
influence
to
endow
all
humanity
with
such
a
belief
if
it
had
no
foundation
whatever
and
could
injustice
be
associated
with
divine
law
he
theos
for
instance
was
certain
of
his
own
immortality
so
certain
that
surrounded
as
he
was
by
this
brilliant
company
of
evident
atheists
he
felt
himself
to
be
the
only
real
and
positive
existing
being
among
an
assembly
of
but
it
was
not
the
time
or
the
place
to
enter
into
a
theological
discussion
especially
with
lysia
and
for
the
moment
at
least
he
allowed
her
assertions
to
remain
uncontradicted
he
sat
however
in
a
somewhat
stern
silence
now
and
then
glancing
wistfully
and
anxiously
at
on
whom
the
potent
wines
were
beginning
to
take
effect
and
who
had
just
thrown
himself
down
on
the
dais
at
lysia
feet
close
to
the
tigress
that
still
lay
couched
there
in
immovable
quiet
it
was
a
picture
worthy
of
the
grandest
painter
brush
that
glistening
throne
black
as
jet
with
the
fair
form
of
lysia
shining
within
it
like
a
white
at
rest
in
a
grotto
of
the
fantastically
attired
negresses
on
each
side
with
their
waving
the
vivid
of
the
dais
against
which
the
black
and
yellow
stripes
of
the
tigress
showed
up
in
strong
and
brilliant
contrast
and
the
graceful
figure
of
the
poet
laureate
who
half
sitting
half
reclining
on
a
black
velvet
cushion
leaned
his
handsome
head
indolently
against
the
silvery
folds
of
lysia
robe
and
looked
up
at
her
with
eyes
in
which
burned
the
ardent
admiration
and
scarcely
restrained
passion
of
a
privileged
lover
suddenly
and
quite
involuntarily
theos
thought
of
niphrata
alas
poor
maiden
how
utterly
her
devotion
to
was
wasted
what
did
he
care
for
her
timid
tenderness
her
unselfish
worship
nothing
less
than
nothing
he
was
entirely
absorbed
by
the
beauty
of
this
wonderful
high
priestess
this
weaver
of
spells
more
potent
than
those
of
circe
and
musing
thereon
theos
was
sorry
for
niphrata
he
knew
not
why
he
felt
that
she
had
somehow
been
wronged
that
she
suffered
and
that
he
as
well
as
was
in
some
mysterious
way
to
blame
for
this
though
he
could
by
no
means
account
for
his
own
share
in
the
dimly
suggested
reproach
this
peculiar
remorseful
emotion
was
transitory
like
all
the
vaguely
incomplete
ideas
that
travelled
mistily
through
his
perplexed
brain
and
he
soon
forgot
it
in
the
increasing
animation
and
interest
of
the
scene
that
immediately
surrounded
him
the
general
conversation
was
becoming
more
and
more
noisy
and
the
laughter
more
and
more
boisterous
several
of
the
young
men
were
now
very
much
the
worse
for
their
frequent
libations
and
particularly
began
again
to
show
marked
symptoms
of
an
inclination
to
break
loose
from
all
the
bonds
of
prudent
reserve
he
lay
full
length
on
his
silk
divan
his
feet
touching
theos
who
sat
upright
and
singing
little
snatches
of
song
to
himself
he
pulled
the
from
his
tumbled
fair
locks
as
though
he
found
it
too
weighty
and
flung
it
on
the
ground
among
the
other
debris
of
the
feast
then
folding
his
arms
lazily
behind
his
head
he
stared
straight
and
fixedly
before
him
at
lysia
seeming
to
note
every
jewel
on
her
dress
every
curve
of
her
body
every
slight
gesture
of
her
hand
every
faint
cold
smile
that
played
on
her
lovely
lips
one
young
man
whom
the
others
addressed
as
ormaz
a
haughty
handsome
fellow
enough
though
with
rather
a
sneering
mouth
just
visible
under
his
black
mustache
was
talking
somewhat
excitedly
on
the
subject
of
khosrul
cunningly
devised
flight
for
it
seemed
to
be
universally
understood
that
the
venerable
prophet
was
one
of
the
circle
of
mystics
persons
whose
knowledge
of
science
especially
in
matters
connected
with
electricity
enabled
them
to
perform
astonishing
juggleries
that
were
frequently
accepted
by
the
uninitiated
vulgar
as
almost
divine
miracles
not
very
long
ago
according
to
ormaz
who
was
animatedly
recalling
the
circumstance
for
the
benefit
of
the
company
the
words
fall
had
appeared
emblazoned
in
letters
of
fire
on
the
sky
at
midnight
and
the
phenomenon
had
been
accompanied
by
two
tremendous
volleys
of
thunder
to
the
infinite
consternation
of
the
multitude
who
received
it
as
a
supernatural
manifestation
but
a
member
of
the
privy
council
a
satirical
skeptic
and
mistruster
of
everybody
word
but
his
own
undertook
to
sift
the
matter
and
adopting
the
dress
of
the
mystics
managed
to
introduce
himself
into
one
of
their
secret
assemblies
where
with
considerable
astonishment
he
saw
them
make
use
of
a
small
wire
by
means
of
which
they
wrote
in
characters
of
azure
flame
on
the
whiteness
of
a
blank
wall
moreover
he
discovered
that
they
possessed
a
lofty
turret
built
secretly
and
securely
in
a
deep
unfrequented
grove
of
trees
from
whence
with
the
aid
of
various
curious
instruments
and
reflectors
they
could
fling
out
any
pattern
or
device
they
chose
on
the
sky
so
that
it
should
seem
to
be
written
by
the
finger
of
lightning
having
elucidated
these
mysteries
and
become
highly
edified
thereby
the
learned
councillor
returned
to
the
king
and
gave
full
information
as
to
the
result
of
his
researches
whereupon
forty
mystics
were
at
once
arrested
and
flung
into
prison
for
life
and
their
nefarious
practices
were
made
publicly
known
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
since
then
no
spiritual
demonstrations
had
taken
place
till
now
when
on
this
very
night
zephoranim
had
been
suddenly
enveloped
in
the
thunderous
and
terrifying
darkness
which
had
so
successfully
covered
khosrul
escape
the
king
should
have
slain
him
at
once
declared
ormaz
emphatically
turning
to
lysia
as
he
i
am
surprised
that
his
majesty
permitted
so
flagrant
an
impostor
and
trespasser
of
the
law
to
speak
one
word
or
live
one
moment
in
his
royal
presence
thou
art
surprised
ormaz
at
most
things
especially
those
which
savor
of
simple
and
forbearance
responded
lysia
coldly
thou
art
a
wolfish
youth
and
wouldst
tear
thine
own
brother
to
shreds
if
he
thwarted
thy
pleasure
for
myself
i
see
little
cause
for
astonishment
that
a
like
zephoranim
should
take
some
pity
on
so
frail
and
aged
a
wreck
of
human
wit
as
khosrul
khosrul
blasphemes
the
faith
what
then
do
ye
not
all
blaspheme
not
in
the
open
streets
said
ormaz
hastily
no
ye
have
not
the
mettle
for
that
and
lysia
smiled
darkly
while
the
great
eye
on
her
breast
flashed
forth
a
sardonic
lustre
strong
as
ye
all
are
and
young
ye
lack
the
bravery
of
the
weak
old
man
who
mad
as
he
may
be
has
at
least
the
courage
of
his
opinions
who
is
there
here
that
believes
in
the
sun
as
a
god
or
in
nagaya
as
a
mediator
not
one
but
ye
are
cultured
hypocrites
all
and
careful
to
keep
your
heresies
secret
and
thou
lysia
suddenly
cried
why
if
thou
canst
so
liberally
admire
the
valor
of
thy
sworn
enemy
khosrul
why
dost
not
thou
step
boldly
forth
and
abjure
the
faith
thou
art
priestess
of
yet
in
thy
heart
deridest
as
a
miserable
superstition
she
turned
her
splendid
flashing
orbs
slowly
upon
him
what
an
awful
chill
steely
glitter
leaped
forth
from
their
depths
prithee
be
heedful
of
thy
speech
good
nirjalis
she
said
with
a
quiver
in
her
voice
curiously
like
the
suppressed
snarl
of
her
pet
the
majority
of
men
are
fools
like
thee
and
need
to
be
ruled
according
to
their
folly
ormaz
broke
into
a
laugh
and
thou
dost
rule
them
wise
virgin
with
a
rod
of
iron
he
said
satirically
the
king
himself
is
but
a
slave
in
thy
hands
the
king
is
a
devout
believer
remarked
a
dainty
youth
arrayed
in
a
wonderfully
picturesque
garb
of
glistening
purple
he
pays
his
vows
to
nagaya
three
times
a
day
at
sunrise
noon
and
sunset
and
is
said
he
hath
oft
been
seen
of
late
in
silent
meditation
alone
before
the
sacred
veil
even
after
midnight
maybe
he
is
there
at
this
very
moment
offering
up
a
royal
petition
for
those
of
his
less
pious
subjects
who
like
ourselves
love
good
wine
more
than
long
prayers
ah
he
is
a
most
austere
and
noble
monarch
a
very
anchorite
and
pattern
of
strict
religious
discipline
and
he
shook
his
head
to
and
fro
with
an
air
of
mock
solemn
fervor
every
one
laughed
and
ormaz
playfully
threw
a
cluster
of
roses
at
the
speaker
hold
thy
foolish
tongue
pharnim
he
said
the
king
doth
but
show
a
fitting
example
to
his
people
there
is
a
time
to
pray
and
a
time
to
feast
and
our
zephoranim
can
do
both
as
becomes
a
man
but
of
his
midnight
meditations
i
have
heard
naught
since
when
hath
he
deserted
his
court
of
love
for
the
colder
chambers
of
the
sacred
temple
ask
lysia
muttered
drowsily
under
his
breath
she
knows
more
of
the
king
than
she
cares
to
confess
his
words
were
spoken
in
a
low
voice
and
yet
they
were
distinct
enough
for
all
present
to
hear
a
glance
of
absolute
dismay
went
round
the
table
and
a
breathless
silence
followed
like
the
ominous
hush
of
a
heated
atmosphere
before
a
apparently
struck
by
the
sudden
stillness
looked
lazily
round
from
among
the
tumbled
cushions
where
he
reclined
a
vacant
tipsy
smile
on
his
lips
what
a
company
of
mutes
ye
are
he
said
did
ye
not
hear
me
i
bade
ye
ask
lysia
and
all
at
once
he
sat
bolt
upright
his
face
crimsoning
as
with
an
access
of
ask
lysia
he
repeated
ask
her
why
the
mighty
zephoranim
creeps
in
and
out
the
sacred
temple
at
midnight
like
a
skulking
slave
instead
of
a
king
at
midnight
when
he
should
be
shut
within
his
palace
walls
playing
the
fool
among
his
women
i
warrant
is
not
piety
that
persuades
him
to
wander
through
the
underground
passage
of
the
tombs
alone
and
in
disguise
pretty
pampered
hound
as
thou
art
thou
art
near
enough
to
our
lady
of
witcheries
ask
her
ask
her
she
knows
and
his
voice
sank
into
an
incoherent
murmur
she
knows
more
than
she
cares
to
confess
another
deep
and
death
like
pause
ensued
and
then
lysia
silvery
cold
tones
smote
the
profound
silence
with
calm
clear
resonance
friend
she
said
how
tuneful
were
her
accents
how
chilly
sweet
her
smile
methinks
thou
art
grown
altogether
too
wise
for
this
world
is
pity
thou
shouldest
continue
to
linger
in
so
narrow
and
incomplete
a
sphere
depart
hence
therefore
i
shall
frely
excuse
thine
absence
since
thy
hour
has
come
and
taking
from
the
table
at
her
side
a
tall
crystal
chalice
fashioned
in
the
form
of
a
lily
set
on
a
golden
stem
she
held
it
up
toward
him
starting
wildly
from
his
couch
he
looked
at
her
as
though
doubting
whether
he
had
heard
her
words
aright
a
strong
shudder
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
his
hands
clenched
themselves
convulsively
together
and
then
slowly
slowly
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
stood
upright
he
was
suddenly
but
effectually
sobered
the
flush
of
intoxication
died
off
his
cheeks
and
his
eyes
grew
strained
and
piteous
theos
watching
him
in
wonder
and
fear
saw
his
broad
chest
heave
with
the
gasping
of
his
breath
advanced
a
step
or
two
then
all
at
once
stretched
out
his
hands
in
imploring
agony
lysia
he
murmured
huskily
lysia
pardon
spare
me
for
the
sake
of
past
love
have
pity
at
this
sprang
up
from
his
lounging
posture
on
the
dais
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
dagger
his
whole
face
flaming
with
wrath
by
my
soul
he
cried
what
doth
this
fellow
prate
of
past
love
thou
profane
boaster
how
darest
thou
speak
of
love
to
the
priestess
of
the
faith
heeded
him
not
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
lysia
like
the
eyes
of
a
tortured
animal
who
vainly
seeks
for
mercy
at
the
hand
of
its
destroyer
step
by
step
he
came
hesitatingly
to
the
foot
of
her
throne
and
it
was
then
that
theos
perceived
rear
at
hand
a
personage
he
immediately
recognized
the
black
slave
gazia
who
had
brought
lysia
message
to
that
same
afternoon
he
had
made
his
appearance
now
so
swiftly
and
silently
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
where
he
had
come
from
and
he
stood
close
to
his
muscular
firms
folded
tightly
across
his
chest
and
his
hideous
mouth
contorted
into
a
grin
of
cruel
amusement
and
expectancy
absolute
quiet
reigned
within
the
magnificent
banquet
hall
the
music
had
ceased
and
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
save
the
delicate
murmur
of
the
wind
outside
swaying
the
on
the
moonlit
lake
every
one
attention
was
centred
on
the
unhappy
young
man
who
with
lifted
head
and
rigidly
clasped
hands
faced
lysia
as
a
criminal
faces
a
judge
lysia
whose
dazzling
smile
beamed
upon
him
with
the
brightness
of
summer
sunbeams
lysia
whose
exquisite
voice
lost
none
of
its
richness
as
she
spoke
his
doom
by
the
vow
which
thou
hast
vowed
to
me
she
said
and
by
thine
oath
sworn
on
the
symbolic
eye
of
raphon
here
she
touched
the
dreadful
jewel
on
her
breast
which
bound
thy
life
to
my
keeping
and
thy
death
to
my
day
of
choice
i
herewith
bestow
on
thee
the
chalice
of
oblivion
the
silver
nectar
of
peace
sleep
and
wake
no
more
drink
and
die
the
gateways
of
the
kingdom
of
silence
stand
open
to
receive
thee
thy
service
is
finished
with
the
utterance
of
the
last
word
she
gave
him
the
glittering
cup
she
held
he
took
it
mechanically
and
for
one
instant
glared
about
him
on
all
sides
scanning
the
faces
of
the
attentive
guests
as
though
in
the
faint
hope
of
some
pity
some
attempt
at
rescue
but
not
a
single
look
of
compassion
was
bestowed
upon
him
save
by
theos
who
full
of
struggling
amazement
and
horror
would
have
broken
out
into
indignant
remonstrance
had
not
an
imperative
glance
from
warned
him
that
any
interference
on
his
part
would
only
make
matters
worse
he
therefore
sorely
against
his
will
and
only
for
sake
kept
silence
watching
meanwhile
in
a
sort
of
horrible
fascination
there
was
something
truly
awful
in
the
radiant
unquenchable
laughter
that
lurked
in
lysia
lovely
eyes
something
positively
devilish
in
the
grace
of
her
manner
as
with
a
negligent
movement
she
reseated
herself
in
her
crystal
throne
and
taking
a
knot
of
that
lay
beside
her
idly
toyed
with
their
creamy
buds
all
the
while
keeping
her
basilisk
gaze
fixed
immovably
and
relentlessly
on
her
sentenced
victim
he
grasping
the
chalice
convulsively
in
his
right
hand
looked
up
despairingly
to
the
polished
dome
of
malachite
with
its
revolving
globe
of
fire
that
shed
a
solemn
glow
upon
his
agonized
young
face
a
smile
was
on
his
lips
the
dreadful
smile
of
desperate
maddened
misery
oh
ye
malignant
gods
he
cried
fiercely
ye
immortal
furies
that
made
woman
for
man
torture
bear
witness
to
my
death
bear
witness
to
my
parting
spirit
malediction
cursed
be
they
who
love
unwisely
and
too
well
cursed
be
all
the
wiles
of
desire
and
the
haunts
of
dear
passion
cursed
he
all
fair
faces
whose
fairness
lures
men
to
destruction
cursed
be
the
warmth
of
caresses
the
beating
of
heart
against
heart
the
kisses
that
color
midnight
with
fire
cursed
be
love
from
birth
unto
death
may
its
sweetness
be
brief
and
its
bitterness
endless
its
delight
a
snare
and
its
promise
treachery
o
ye
mad
lovers
fools
all
and
he
turned
his
splendid
wild
eyes
round
on
the
hushed
assemblage
despise
me
and
my
words
as
ye
will
throughout
ages
to
come
the
curse
of
the
dead
shall
cling
he
lifted
the
goblet
to
his
lips
and
just
then
his
delirious
glanced
lighted
on
i
drink
to
thee
sir
laureate
he
said
hoarsely
and
with
a
ghastly
attempt
at
levity
sing
as
sweetly
as
thou
wilt
thou
must
drain
the
same
cup
ere
long
and
without
another
second
hesitation
he
drank
off
the
entire
contents
of
the
chalice
at
a
draught
scarcely
had
he
done
so
when
with
a
savage
scream
he
fell
prone
on
the
ground
his
limbs
twisted
in
acute
agony
his
features
hideously
contorted
his
hands
beating
the
air
wildly
as
though
in
contention
with
some
invisible
foe
in
strange
and
terrible
dissonance
with
his
tortured
cries
laughter
musically
mellow
broke
out
in
little
quick
peals
like
the
laughter
of
a
very
young
child
ah
ah
she
exclaimed
thou
dost
suffer
that
is
well
i
do
rejoice
to
see
thee
fighting
for
life
in
the
very
jaws
of
death
fain
would
i
have
all
men
thus
tortured
out
of
their
proud
and
tyrannous
existence
their
strength
made
strengthless
their
arrogance
brought
to
naught
their
egotism
and
beaten
to
the
dust
ah
ah
thou
that
wert
the
complacent
braggart
of
love
the
proclaimer
of
thine
own
prowess
where
is
thy
boasted
vigor
now
writhe
on
good
fool
thy
little
day
is
done
all
honor
to
the
silver
nectar
whose
venom
never
fails
leaning
forward
eagerly
she
clapped
her
hands
in
a
sort
of
fierce
ecstasy
and
apparently
startled
by
the
sound
the
tigress
rose
up
from
its
couchant
posture
and
shaking
itself
with
a
snarling
yawn
glared
watchfully
at
the
convulsed
human
wretch
whose
struggles
became
with
each
moment
more
and
more
frightful
to
witness
the
impassive
calmness
with
which
all
the
men
present
even
looked
on
at
the
revolting
spectacle
of
their
late
comrade
torture
filled
theos
with
shuddering
abhorrence
sick
at
heart
he
strove
to
turn
away
his
eyes
from
the
straining
throat
and
upturned
face
of
the
miserable
a
face
that
had
a
moment
or
two
before
been
beautiful
but
was
now
so
disfigured
as
to
be
almost
beyond
recognition
presently
as
the
anguish
of
the
poisoned
victim
increased
shriek
after
shriek
broke
from
his
pallid
lips
rolling
himself
on
the
ground
like
a
wild
beast
he
bit
his
hands
and
arms
in
his
frenzy
till
he
was
covered
with
blood
and
again
and
yet
again
the
dulcet
laughter
of
the
high
priestess
echoed
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
splendid
hall
and
even
the
poet
condescended
to
smile
that
smile
so
cold
so
cruel
so
unpitying
made
theos
for
a
moment
hate
him
of
what
use
he
thought
was
it
to
be
a
writer
of
soft
and
delicate
verse
if
the
inner
nature
of
the
man
was
merciless
selfish
and
utterly
regardless
of
the
woes
of
others
the
rest
of
the
guests
were
profoundly
indifferent
they
kept
silence
it
is
true
but
they
went
on
drinking
their
wine
with
perfectly
unabated
they
were
evidently
accustomed
to
such
scenes
the
attendant
slaves
stood
all
mute
and
motionless
with
the
exception
of
gazra
who
surveyed
the
torments
of
with
an
air
of
professional
interest
and
appeared
to
be
waiting
till
they
should
have
reached
that
pitch
of
excruciating
agony
when
nature
exhausted
gives
up
the
conflict
and
welcomes
death
as
a
release
from
pain
but
this
desirable
end
was
not
yet
suddenly
springing
to
his
feet
tore
open
his
richly
jewelled
vest
and
pressed
his
two
hands
hard
upon
his
heart
the
veins
in
his
flesh
were
swollen
and
blue
his
labored
breath
seemed
as
though
it
must
break
his
ribs
in
its
terrible
panting
struggle
his
face
livid
and
lined
with
purple
marks
like
heavy
bruises
bore
not
a
single
trace
of
its
former
fairness
and
his
eyes
rolled
up
and
fixed
glassily
in
their
quivering
sockets
seemed
to
be
dreadfully
filled
with
the
speechless
memory
of
his
lately
spoken
curse
he
staggered
toward
theos
and
dropped
heavily
on
his
knees
kill
me
he
moaned
piteously
feebly
pointing
to
the
sheathed
dagger
in
the
other
belt
in
mercy
kill
me
one
thrust
release
me
this
agony
is
more
than
i
can
bear
kill
kill
his
voice
died
away
in
an
inarticulate
gasping
cry
and
theos
stared
down
upon
him
in
dizzy
fear
and
horror
for
he
had
seen
this
same
dying
thus
cruelly
before
oh
god
where
where
had
this
tragedy
been
previously
enacted
bewildered
and
overcome
with
unspeakable
dread
he
drew
his
dagger
he
would
at
least
he
thought
put
the
tortured
sufferer
out
of
his
misery
but
scarcely
had
his
weapon
left
the
sheath
when
lysia
clear
cold
voice
exclaimed
disarm
him
and
with
the
silent
rapidity
of
a
gazra
glided
to
his
side
and
the
steel
was
snatched
from
his
hand
full
of
outraged
pride
and
wrath
he
sprang
up
a
torrent
of
words
rushing
to
his
lips
but
before
he
could
utter
one
two
slaves
pounced
upon
him
and
holding
his
arms
dexterously
wound
a
silk
scarf
tight
about
his
mouth
be
silent
whispered
some
one
in
his
ear
as
you
value
your
life
and
the
life
of
be
silent
but
he
cared
nothing
for
this
warning
reckless
of
consequences
he
tore
the
scarf
away
and
breaking
loose
from
the
hands
that
held
him
made
a
bound
toward
lysia
here
he
paused
her
eyes
met
his
languidly
shedding
a
sombre
mysterious
light
upon
him
through
the
black
shower
of
her
abundant
hair
the
evil
glitter
of
the
great
symbolic
gem
she
wore
fixed
him
with
its
stony
yet
mesmeric
luster
a
delicious
smile
parted
her
roseate
lips
and
breaking
off
a
from
the
cluster
she
held
she
kissed
and
gave
it
to
him
be
at
peace
good
theos
she
said
in
a
low
tender
tone
beware
of
taking
up
arms
in
the
defence
of
the
unworthy
rather
reserve
thy
courage
for
those
who
know
how
best
to
reward
thy
service
as
one
in
a
trance
he
took
the
flower
she
offered
its
fragrance
subtle
and
sweet
seemed
to
steal
into
his
veins
and
rob
his
manhood
of
all
strength
sinking
submissively
at
her
feet
he
gazed
up
at
her
in
wondering
wistfulness
and
ardent
admiration
never
was
there
a
woman
so
bewilderingly
beautiful
as
she
what
were
the
sufferings
of
now
what
was
anything
compared
to
the
strangely
enervating
ecstasy
he
felt
in
letting
his
eyes
dwell
fondly
on
the
fairness
of
her
face
the
whiteness
of
her
bosom
the
delicate
sheeny
dazzle
of
her
polished
skin
the
soft
and
supple
curves
of
her
whole
exquisite
form
and
by
the
witchery
of
her
loveliness
he
almost
forgot
the
very
presence
of
her
dying
victim
occasionally
indeed
he
glanced
at
the
agonized
creature
where
he
lay
huddled
on
the
ground
in
the
convulsive
throes
of
his
dreadful
but
it
was
now
with
precisely
the
same
quiet
and
disdainful
smile
as
that
for
which
he
had
momentarily
hated
there
was
a
sound
of
singing
somewhere
singing
that
had
a
mirthful
in
it
as
though
a
thousand
fairies
were
dancing
to
its
sweet
refrain
and
heard
it
dying
inch
by
inch
as
he
was
he
heard
it
and
with
a
last
superhuman
effort
forced
himself
up
once
more
to
his
feet
his
arms
stiffly
outstretched
his
anguished
eyes
full
of
a
softened
strangely
piteous
glory
to
die
he
whispered
in
awed
accents
that
penetrated
the
air
with
singular
clearness
to
die
nay
not
so
there
is
no
death
i
see
it
all
i
know
die
is
to
live
to
live
and
to
remember
to
remember
and
repent
the
past
and
with
the
last
word
he
fell
heavily
face
forward
a
corpse
at
the
same
moment
a
terrific
roar
resounded
through
the
dome
and
the
tigress
aizif
sprang
stealthily
down
from
the
dais
and
pounced
upon
the
warm
lifeless
body
mounting
guard
over
it
in
an
ominously
significant
attitude
with
glistening
eyes
lashing
tail
and
nervously
quivering
claws
a
slight
thrill
of
horror
ran
through
the
company
but
not
a
man
moved
aizif
aizif
called
lysia
imperiously
the
animal
looked
round
with
an
angry
snarl
and
seemed
for
once
disposed
to
disobey
the
summons
of
its
mistress
she
therefore
rose
from
her
throne
and
stepping
forward
with
a
swift
agile
grace
caught
the
savage
beast
by
the
neck
and
dragged
it
from
its
desired
prey
then
with
the
point
of
her
little
foot
she
turned
the
fallen
face
of
the
dead
man
slightly
round
so
that
she
might
observe
it
more
attentively
and
noting
its
livid
disfigurement
smiled
so
much
for
the
beauty
and
dignity
of
manhood
she
said
with
a
contemptuous
shrug
of
her
snowy
shoulders
all
perished
in
the
space
of
a
few
brief
moments
look
you
ye
fair
sirs
that
take
pride
in
your
strength
and
muscular
attainments
ye
shall
not
find
in
all
a
fairer
face
or
more
nobly
knit
frame
than
was
possessed
by
this
dead
fool
and
yet
lo
how
the
silver
nectar
doth
make
havoc
on
the
sinews
of
adamant
the
nerves
of
steel
the
stalwart
limbs
tried
by
the
touchstone
of
death
ye
are
with
all
your
vaunted
intelligence
your
domineering
audacity
and
no
better
than
the
slain
dogs
that
serve
vultures
for
carrion
moreover
ye
are
less
than
dogs
in
honesty
and
vastly
shamed
by
them
in
fidelity
she
laughed
scornfully
as
she
spoke
still
grasping
the
tigress
by
the
neck
in
one
slight
hand
and
her
glorious
eyes
flashed
a
mocking
defiance
on
all
the
men
assembled
their
countenances
exhibited
various
expressions
of
uneasiness
amounting
to
fear
some
few
smiled
forcedly
others
feigned
a
careless
indifference
flushed
an
angry
red
and
theos
though
he
knew
not
why
felt
a
sudden
pricking
sense
of
shame
she
marked
all
these
signs
of
disquietude
with
apparently
increasing
amusement
for
her
lovely
face
grew
warm
and
radiant
with
suppressed
malicious
mirth
she
made
a
slight
imperative
gesture
of
command
to
gazra
who
at
once
approached
and
bending
over
the
dead
proceeded
to
strip
off
all
the
gold
clasps
and
valuable
jewels
that
had
so
lavishly
adorned
the
young
attire
then
beckoning
another
slave
nearly
as
tall
and
muscular
as
himself
they
attached
to
the
neck
and
feet
of
the
corpse
round
leaden
weights
fastened
by
means
of
heavy
iron
chains
this
done
they
raised
the
body
from
the
floor
and
carried
it
between
them
to
the
central
and
largest
casement
of
all
that
stood
open
to
the
midnight
air
and
with
a
dexterous
movement
flung
it
out
into
the
waters
of
the
lake
beneath
it
fell
with
a
sullen
splash
the
pale
lilies
on
the
surface
rocking
stormily
to
and
fro
as
though
blown
by
a
gust
of
wind
while
great
circling
ripples
shone
softly
in
the
yellow
gleam
of
the
moonlight
as
the
dead
man
sank
down
down
down
like
a
stone
into
his
grave
lysia
returned
to
her
throne
with
a
serene
step
and
unruffled
brow
followed
by
the
sulky
and
disappointed
aizif
smiling
gently
on
theos
and
she
reseated
herself
and
touched
a
small
bell
at
her
side
it
gave
a
sharp
like
a
suddenly
struck
cymbal
and
lo
the
marble
floor
yawned
asunder
and
the
with
all
its
costly
fruits
and
flowers
vanished
underground
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
the
floor
closed
again
the
broad
circular
of
the
hall
was
now
clear
from
all
obstruction
and
the
company
of
revellers
roused
themselves
a
little
from
their
drowsy
postures
of
languor
the
singing
voices
that
had
stirred
to
sudden
animation
even
in
his
dying
agony
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
and
the
globe
of
fire
overhead
changed
its
hue
from
that
of
crimson
to
a
delicate
pink
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
glittering
vista
of
transparent
columns
a
door
suddenly
opened
and
a
flock
of
doves
came
speeding
forth
their
white
spread
wings
colored
softly
in
the
clear
they
circled
round
and
round
the
dome
three
times
then
fluttered
in
a
palpitating
arch
over
lysia
head
and
finally
sped
straight
across
the
hall
to
the
other
end
where
they
streamed
snowily
through
another
aperture
and
disappeared
still
nearer
rippled
the
sound
of
singing
and
all
at
once
a
troop
of
girls
came
dancing
noiselessly
as
into
the
full
quivering
pinkness
of
the
light
that
floated
about
them
girls
as
lovely
as
delicate
as
dainty
as
cyclamens
that
wave
in
the
woods
in
the
early
days
of
an
italian
spring
their
garments
were
so
white
so
transparent
so
filmy
and
clinging
that
they
looked
like
elves
robed
in
rather
than
human
creatures
there
were
fifty
of
them
in
all
and
as
they
tripped
forward
they
like
the
doves
that
had
heralded
their
approach
surrounded
lysia
flutteringly
saluting
her
with
gestures
of
exquisite
grace
and
devout
humility
while
she
enthroned
in
supreme
fairness
with
her
tigress
crouched
beside
her
looked
down
on
them
like
a
goddess
calmly
surveying
a
crowd
of
vestal
worshippers
their
salutations
done
they
rushed
like
a
shower
of
white
drifting
before
a
gale
into
the
exact
centre
of
the
hall
and
there
poising
with
their
snowy
arms
upraised
as
though
about
to
fly
they
waited
their
lovely
faces
radiant
with
laughter
their
eyes
flashing
dangerous
allurement
their
limbs
glistening
like
polished
alabaster
through
the
gauzy
attire
that
betrayed
rather
than
concealed
their
exquisite
forms
then
came
the
soft
pizzicato
of
pulled
strings
and
a
tinkling
jangle
of
silver
bells
beating
out
a
measured
languorous
rhythm
and
with
one
accord
they
all
merged
together
in
the
voluptuous
grace
of
a
dance
more
ravishing
more
wild
and
wondrous
than
ever
poet
pictured
in
his
of
theos
drank
in
the
intoxicating
delight
of
the
scene
with
eager
dazzled
eyes
and
heavily
beating
heart
mysterious
passion
of
mingled
love
and
hatred
he
felt
for
lysia
stole
over
him
more
strongly
than
ever
in
the
sultry
air
of
this
strange
night
this
night
of
sweet
delirium
in
which
all
that
was
most
dangerous
and
erring
in
his
nature
woke
into
life
and
mastered
his
better
will
a
curious
instinctive
knowledge
swept
across
his
mind
namely
that
emotions
were
the
faithful
reflex
of
his
own
but
as
he
had
felt
no
anger
against
his
rival
in
fame
so
now
he
had
no
jealousy
of
his
possible
rival
in
love
their
sympathies
were
too
closely
united
for
distrust
to
mar
the
friendship
so
ardently
begun
nevertheless
as
he
fell
resistlessly
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
glittering
snares
that
were
spread
for
his
destruction
he
was
conscious
of
evil
though
he
lacked
force
to
overcome
it
at
any
rate
he
would
save
from
harm
he
resolved
if
he
could
not
save
himself
meantime
he
watched
the
bewildering
evolutions
and
witching
entanglements
of
the
gliding
maze
of
fair
faces
snowy
bosoms
and
twining
limbs
that
palpitated
to
and
fro
under
the
soft
of
the
dome
like
white
flowers
colored
by
the
sunset
and
glancing
ever
and
again
at
lysia
imperial
he
thought
dreamily
better
the
love
that
kills
than
no
love
at
all
and
he
thereupon
gave
himself
up
a
voluntary
captive
to
the
sway
of
his
own
passions
determining
to
enjoy
the
immediate
present
no
matter
what
the
future
might
have
in
store
outside
the
nodded
themselves
to
sleep
in
their
shrouding
dark
leaves
and
the
unbroken
smoothness
of
the
lake
spread
itself
out
in
the
moon
like
a
sheet
of
molten
gold
over
the
spot
where
had
found
his
chilly
rest
the
curse
of
the
dead
shall
cling
yes
possibly
in
the
hereafter
but
now
his
parting
malison
seemed
but
a
foolish
clamor
against
destiny
he
was
gone
none
of
his
late
companions
missed
him
none
regretted
him
like
all
dead
men
once
dead
he
was

chapter
xix
a
strange
temptation
on
went
the
dance
faster
faster
and
ever
faster
only
the
pen
of
some
greek
bard
could
adequately
describe
the
dazzling
wild
beauty
and
fantastic
grace
of
those
whirling
fairy
forms
that
now
inspired
to
a
ardor
urged
one
another
to
fresh
speed
with
brief
soft
cries
of
musical
rapture
now
advancing
now
retreating
now
intermingling
all
together
in
an
undulating
garland
of
living
loveliness
now
parting
asunder
with
an
air
of
sweet
coquettishness
and
caprice
anon
meeting
again
and
winding
arm
within
arm
till
bending
forward
in
attitudes
of
the
tenderest
entreaty
they
seemed
with
their
languid
praying
eyes
and
clasped
hands
to
be
waiting
for
love
to
soothe
the
breathless
sweetness
of
their
parted
lips
with
kisses
the
light
in
the
dome
again
changed
its
hue
from
pale
it
flickered
to
delicate
flooding
the
floor
with
a
radiance
as
of
watery
moonbeams
and
softening
the
daintily
draped
outlines
of
that
exquisite
group
of
human
blossoms
till
they
looked
like
the
dimly
imagined
shapes
of
nereids
floating
on
the
glistening
width
of
the
sea
and
now
the
extreme
end
of
the
vast
hall
began
to
waver
to
and
fro
as
though
shaken
at
its
foundation
by
subterranean
forces
a
flaring
shaft
of
flame
struck
through
it
like
the
sweeping
blade
of
a
sword
and
presently
with
a
thunderous
noise
the
whole
wall
split
asunder
and
recoiling
backwards
on
either
side
disclosed
a
garden
golden
with
the
sleepy
glory
of
the
late
moon
and
peacefully
fair
in
all
the
dreamy
attractiveness
of
drooping
foliage
soft
turf
and
violet
sky
in
full
view
and
lit
up
by
the
reflected
radiance
flung
out
from
the
dome
a
rushing
waterfall
made
sonorous
surgy
music
of
its
own
as
it
tumbled
headlong
into
a
rocky
recess
overgrown
with
and
plumy
fern
here
and
there
small
white
and
gold
tents
or
pavilions
glimmered
invitingly
through
the
shadows
cast
by
the
great
magnolia
trees
from
whose
lovely
buds
balmy
odors
crept
deliciously
through
the
warm
air
the
sound
of
sweet
pipes
and
faintly
tinkling
cymbals
echoed
from
distant
shady
nooks
as
though
elfin
shepherds
were
guarding
their
fairy
flocks
in
some
hidden
corner
of
this
ambrosial
pasturage
and
ever
by
degrees
the
light
grew
warmer
and
more
mellow
in
tint
till
it
resembled
the
deep
hue
of
an
autumn
yellow
sunset
flecked
through
with
emerald
haze
another
clash
of
cymbals
this
time
stormily
persistent
and
convincing
another
yet
another
and
then
a
chime
of
bells
a
steady
ringing
persuasive
chime
such
as
brings
tears
to
the
eyes
of
many
a
wanderer
who
hearing
a
similar
sound
when
far
away
from
home
straightway
thinks
of
the
village
church
of
his
earlier
years
those
years
of
the
best
happiness
we
ever
know
on
earth
because
we
enjoy
in
them
the
bliss
of
ignorance
the
glory
of
youth
a
curious
stifling
sensation
began
to
oppress
theos
heart
as
he
listened
to
those
bells
they
reminded
him
of
such
strange
things
things
to
which
he
could
not
give
a
name
things
foolish
yet
sweet
odd
suggestions
of
fair
women
who
were
wont
to
pray
for
those
they
loved
and
who
believed
alas
the
pity
of
it
that
their
prayers
would
be
heard
and
granted
what
was
it
that
these
dear
loving
credulous
ones
said
when
in
the
silence
of
the
night
they
offered
up
their
patient
supplications
to
an
irresponsive
heaven
lead
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil
yes
he
remembered
those
were
the
words
the
words
that
for
minds
had
neither
meaning
nor
reason
and
that
yet
were
so
infinitely
pathetic
in
their
perfect
humility
and
absolute
trust
lead
us
not
into
temptation
he
murmured
the
phrase
under
his
breath
as
he
gazed
with
straining
eyes
out
into
the
languorous
beauty
of
that
that
spread
its
dewy
emerald
glamour
before
him
and
deliver
us
from
evil
broke
from
his
lips
in
a
sigh
as
the
peal
of
the
chiming
bells
softened
by
degrees
into
a
subdued
tunefulness
of
indistinct
and
tremulous
semitones
and
the
of
the
cymbals
again
smote
the
still
air
with
forceful
and
jarring
clangor
then
like
a
peri
floating
easefully
out
of
some
sphere
of
an
aerial
glided
into
the
full
lustre
of
the
varying
light
a
dancer
nude
save
for
the
pearly
glistening
veil
that
was
carelessly
cast
about
her
dainty
limbs
her
white
arms
and
delicate
ankles
being
adorned
with
circlets
of
tiny
golden
bells
which
kept
up
a
melodious
as
she
moved
and
now
began
the
strangest
music
music
that
seemed
to
hover
capriciously
between
luscious
melody
and
harsh
discord
a
wild
and
curious
medley
of
fantastic
minor
suggestions
in
which
the
imaginative
soul
might
discover
hints
of
tears
and
folly
love
and
madness
to
this
uncertain
yet
voluptuous
measure
the
glittering
leaped
forward
with
a
startlingly
beautiful
abruptness
and
halting
as
it
were
on
the
between
the
dome
and
the
garden
beyond
raised
her
rounded
arms
in
a
snowy
arch
above
her
head
and
so
for
one
brief
instant
looked
like
an
exquisite
angel
ready
to
soar
upward
to
her
native
realm
her
pause
was
a
mere
breathing
space
in
duration
dropping
her
arms
again
with
a
swift
decision
that
set
all
the
little
bells
on
them
clashing
stormily
she
straightway
hurled
herself
so
to
speak
into
the
giddy
paces
of
a
dance
that
was
more
like
an
enigma
than
an
exercise
round
and
round
she
floated
wildly
like
an
butterfly
in
a
net
of
sunbeams
now
seemingly
shaken
by
delicate
tremors
as
aspen
leaves
are
shaken
by
the
faintest
wind
assuming
the
most
voluptuous
eccentricities
of
posture
sometimes
bending
wistfully
toward
the
velvet
turf
on
which
she
trod
as
though
she
listened
to
the
chanting
of
demon
voices
underground
and
again
with
her
waving
white
hands
appearing
to
summon
spirits
downward
from
their
wanderings
in
upper
air
her
figure
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
seductive
grace
of
her
gestures
not
only
her
twinkling
feet
but
her
whole
body
danced
her
very
features
bespoke
entire
abandonment
to
the
frenzy
of
rapid
movement
her
large
black
eyes
flashed
with
something
of
fierceness
as
well
as
languor
her
raven
hair
streamed
behind
her
like
a
dark
spread
wing
her
parted
lips
pouted
and
quivered
with
excitement
and
ardor
while
ever
and
anon
she
turned
her
beautiful
head
toward
the
eagerly
attentive
group
of
revelers
who
watched
her
performance
with
an
air
of
indescribable
sweetness
malice
and
mockery
again
and
again
she
whirled
she
flew
she
sprang
and
wild
cries
of
hail
nelida
triumph
to
nelida
resounded
uproariously
through
the
dome
suddenly
the
character
of
the
music
changed
from
an
appealing
murmurous
complaint
and
persuasion
it
rose
to
a
martial
and
almost
menacing
fervor
the
roll
of
drums
and
the
shrill
reedy
warbling
of
pipes
and
other
fluty
minstrelsy
crossed
the
silvery
thread
of
strung
harps
and
viols
the
light
from
the
fiery
globe
shot
forth
a
new
effulgence
this
time
in
two
broad
rays
one
a
dazzling
pale
azure
the
other
a
clear
pearly
white
nelida
graceful
movements
grew
slower
and
slower
till
she
merely
seemed
to
sway
indolently
to
and
fro
like
a
mermaid
rocking
herself
to
sleep
on
the
summit
of
a
wave
and
then
from
among
the
veiling
shadows
of
the
trees
there
stepped
forth
a
man
beautiful
as
a
sculptured
god
of
magnificently
moulded
form
and
noble
stature
clothed
from
chest
to
knee
in
a
close
fitting
garb
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
thick
network
of
massively
linked
gold
his
dark
hair
was
crowned
with
ivy
and
at
his
belt
gleamed
an
unsheathed
dagger
slowly
and
with
courtly
grace
he
approached
the
panting
nelida
who
now
with
eyes
and
slackening
steps
looked
as
though
she
were
drowsily
footing
her
way
into
dreamland
he
touched
her
snowy
shoulder
she
started
with
an
inimitable
gesture
of
surprise
a
smile
brilliant
as
morning
dawned
on
her
face
withdrawing
herself
slightly
she
assumed
an
air
of
haughtily
sweet
disdain
and
refusal
then
capriciously
relenting
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
in
another
instant
to
the
sound
of
a
joyous
melody
that
seemed
to
tumble
through
the
air
as
billows
tumble
on
the
beach
the
dazzling
pair
whirled
away
in
a
giddy
waltz
like
two
bright
flames
blown
suddenly
together
by
the
wind
no
language
could
give
an
adequate
idea
of
the
marvelous
bewitchment
and
beauty
of
their
united
movements
and
as
they
flew
over
the
dark
smooth
turf
with
the
trees
drooping
dewily
about
them
and
the
yellow
moonbeams
like
melted
amber
beneath
their
noiseless
feet
while
the
pale
sapphire
and
white
radiations
from
the
dome
sparkling
upon
them
gave
them
the
appearance
of
glittering
birds
circling
through
a
limitless
space
of
luminous
and
ether
on
on
and
they
scarcely
touched
the
earth
as
they
spun
dizzily
round
and
round
their
gracefully
entwined
limbs
shining
like
polished
ivory
in
the
light
on
on
with
swiftness
they
sped
till
their
two
forms
seemed
to
merge
into
one
when
as
though
oppressed
by
their
own
abandonment
of
joy
they
paused
hoveringly
their
embracing
arms
closing
round
one
another
their
lips
almost
touching
their
eyes
reflecting
each
other
ardent
looks
then
their
figures
grew
less
and
less
distinct
they
appeared
to
melt
mysteriously
into
the
azure
pearly
light
that
surrounded
them
and
finally
like
faint
clouds
fading
on
the
edge
of
a
they
vanished
the
effect
of
this
brief
voluptuous
dance
and
its
equally
voluptuous
end
was
simply
indescribable
the
young
men
who
had
watched
it
through
in
silence
and
flushed
ecstasy
now
sprang
from
their
couches
with
shouts
of
rapture
and
unrestrained
excitement
and
seizing
the
other
who
had
till
now
remained
in
clustered
groups
behind
the
crystalline
columns
of
the
hall
whirled
them
off
into
the
inviting
pleasaunce
beyond
where
the
little
white
and
gold
pavilions
peeped
through
the
heavy
foliage
and
before
theos
in
the
picturesque
hurry
and
confusion
of
the
scene
could
quite
realize
what
had
happened
the
great
globe
in
the
dome
was
suddenly
extinguished
a
firm
hand
closed
imperiously
on
his
own
and
he
was
drawn
along
swiftly
he
knew
not
whither
a
slight
tremor
shook
him
as
he
discovered
that
was
no
longer
by
his
side
the
friend
whom
he
so
ardently
desired
to
protect
had
gone
and
he
could
not
tell
where
he
glanced
about
him
in
the
he
was
able
to
discern
the
sheen
of
the
lake
with
its
white
burden
of
and
the
branchy
outlines
of
the
moonlit
garden
and
yes
it
was
lysia
whose
grasp
lay
so
warmly
on
his
arm
lysia
whose
lovely
tempting
face
was
so
perilously
near
his
own
lysia
whose
smile
colored
the
soft
gloom
with
such
alluring
lustre
his
heart
beat
his
blood
burned
he
strove
in
vain
to
imagine
what
fate
was
now
in
store
for
him
he
was
conscious
of
the
beauty
of
the
night
that
spread
its
splendors
about
him
conscious
too
of
the
vital
youth
and
passion
that
throbbed
amorously
in
his
veins
endowing
him
with
that
keenly
sweet
headstrong
rapture
which
is
said
to
come
but
once
in
a
lifetime
and
which
in
the
very
excess
of
its
fond
folly
is
too
often
apt
to
bring
sorrow
and
endless
remorse
in
its
train
one
moment
more
and
he
found
himself
in
an
exquisitely
adorned
pavilion
of
painted
silk
faintly
lit
by
one
lamp
of
tenderest
rose
lustre
and
carpeted
with
tissue
it
was
surrounded
by
a
thicket
of
orange
trees
in
full
bloom
and
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
clung
heavily
to
the
air
breathing
forth
delicate
suggestions
of
languor
and
sleep
the
measured
rush
of
the
near
waterfall
alone
disturbed
the
deep
silence
with
now
and
then
the
subdued
and
plaintive
trill
of
a
nightingale
soothing
itself
to
rest
with
its
own
song
in
some
deep
shadowed
copse
here
on
a
couch
of
stemless
roses
such
as
might
have
been
prepared
for
the
repose
of
titania
lysia
seated
herself
while
theos
stood
gazing
at
her
in
fascinated
wonderment
and
gradually
increasing
masterfulness
of
passion
she
looked
lovelier
than
ever
in
that
dim
soft
mingled
light
of
rosy
lamp
and
silver
moonbeams
her
smile
was
no
longer
cold
but
warmly
sweet
her
eyes
had
lost
their
mocking
glitter
and
swam
in
a
soft
languor
that
was
strangely
bewitching
even
the
orbed
symbol
on
her
white
bosom
seemed
for
once
to
drowse
her
lips
parted
in
a
faint
sigh
a
glance
like
fire
flashed
from
beneath
her
black
silken
lashes
theos
she
said
tremulously
theos
and
waited
he
mute
and
oppressed
by
indistinct
hovering
recollections
fed
his
gaze
on
her
seductive
fairness
for
one
earnest
moment
longer
then
suddenly
advancing
he
knelt
before
her
and
took
her
unresisting
hands
in
his
lysia
and
his
voice
even
to
his
own
ears
had
a
solemn
as
well
as
passionate
thrill
lysia
what
wouldst
thou
have
with
me
speak
for
my
heart
aches
with
a
burden
of
dark
memories
memories
conjured
up
by
the
wizard
spell
of
thine
eyes
those
eyes
so
that
seem
to
lure
me
to
my
soul
ruin
tell
me
have
we
not
met
before
loved
before
wronged
each
other
and
god
before
parted
before
maybe
is
but
a
brain
sick
fancy
nevertheless
my
spirit
knows
thee
feels
thee
clings
to
thee
and
yet
recoils
from
thee
as
one
whom
i
did
love
in
days
of
old
my
thoughts
of
thee
are
strange
fair
lysia
and
he
pressed
her
warm
delicate
fingers
with
unconscious
fierceness
i
would
have
sworn
that
in
the
past
thou
didst
betray
me
her
low
laugh
stirred
the
silence
into
a
faint
tuneful
echo
thou
foolish
dreamer
she
murmured
half
mockingly
half
tenderly
thou
art
dazed
with
wine
steeped
in
song
bewitched
with
beauty
and
knowest
nothing
of
what
thou
sayest
methinks
thou
art
a
crazed
poet
and
more
fervid
than
in
the
mystic
nature
of
thine
utterance
thou
shouldst
be
laureate
not
he
what
if
thou
wert
offered
his
place
his
fame
he
looked
at
her
surprised
and
perplexed
and
paused
an
instant
before
replying
then
he
said
slowly
so
strange
a
thing
could
never
be
for
place
once
empty
could
not
again
be
filled
i
grudge
him
not
his
moreover
what
is
fame
compared
to
love
he
uttered
the
last
words
in
a
low
tone
as
though
he
spoke
them
to
himself
she
heard
and
a
flash
of
triumph
brightened
her
beautiful
face
ah
and
she
drooped
her
head
lower
and
lower
till
her
dark
fragrant
tresses
touched
his
brow
then
thou
dost
love
me
he
started
a
dull
pang
ached
in
his
heart
a
chill
of
vague
uncertainty
and
dread
love
was
it
love
indeed
that
he
felt
love
or
base
desire
love
the
word
rang
in
his
ears
with
the
same
sacred
suggestiveness
as
that
conveyed
by
the
chime
of
bells
surely
love
was
a
holy
thing
a
passion
pure
impersonal
divine
and
deathless
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
somewhere
it
had
been
written
or
said
wheresoever
a
man
seeketh
himself
there
he
falleth
from
love
and
he
did
he
not
seek
himself
and
the
gratification
of
his
own
immediate
pleasure
painfully
he
considered
it
was
a
supreme
moment
with
him
a
moment
when
he
felt
himself
to
be
positively
held
within
the
grasp
of
some
great
archangel
who
turning
grandly
reproachful
eyes
upon
him
demanded
art
thou
the
servant
of
love
or
the
slave
of
self
and
while
he
remained
silent
the
silken
sweet
voice
of
the
fairest
woman
he
had
ever
seen
once
more
sent
its
musical
cadence
through
his
brain
in
that
fateful
question
thou
dost
love
me
a
deep
sigh
broke
from
him
he
moved
nearer
to
her
he
entwined
her
warm
waist
with
his
arms
and
stared
upon
her
as
though
he
drank
her
beauty
in
with
his
eyes
up
to
the
crowning
masses
of
her
dusky
hair
where
the
little
serpents
heads
darted
forth
glisteningly
over
the
dainty
curve
of
her
white
shoulders
and
bosom
where
the
symbolic
eye
seemed
to
regard
him
with
a
sleepy
weirdness
down
to
the
small
feet
in
the
silvery
sandals
and
up
again
to
the
red
witchery
of
her
mouth
and
black
splendor
of
those
twin
that
flashed
beneath
her
heavy
lashes
his
gaze
wandered
hungrily
searchingly
passionately
his
heart
beat
with
a
loud
impatient
eagerness
like
a
wild
thing
struggling
in
its
cage
but
though
his
lips
moved
he
said
no
word
she
too
was
silent
so
passed
or
seemed
to
pass
some
minutes
minutes
that
were
almost
terrible
in
the
weight
of
mysterious
meaning
they
held
unuttered
then
with
a
cry
he
suddenly
released
her
and
sprang
erect
love
he
cried
nay
is
a
word
for
children
and
angels
not
for
me
what
have
i
to
do
with
love
what
hast
thou
thou
lysia
who
dost
make
the
lives
of
men
thy
sport
and
their
torments
thy
mockery
there
is
no
name
for
this
fever
that
consumes
me
when
i
look
upon
thee
no
name
for
this
unquiet
ravishment
that
draws
me
to
thee
in
mingled
bliss
and
agony
if
i
must
perish
of
mine
own
frenzy
let
me
be
slain
now
and
most
utterly
but
love
has
no
me
and
thee
lysia
love
ah
no
no
speak
no
more
of
love
it
hath
a
charmed
sound
recalling
to
my
soul
some
glory
i
have
lost
he
spoke
wildly
incoherently
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
and
she
half
lying
on
her
couch
of
roses
looked
at
him
curiously
with
somber
meditative
eyes
a
smile
of
delicate
derision
parted
her
lips
of
a
truth
our
late
feasting
hath
roused
in
thee
a
most
singular
delirium
she
murmured
indolently
with
a
touch
of
cold
amusement
in
her
accents
thou
dost
seem
to
dwell
in
the
past
rather
than
the
present
what
ails
thee
come
hither
closer
and
she
stretched
out
her
lovely
arms
on
which
the
twisted
diamond
snakes
glittered
in
such
flashing
coils
come
or
is
thy
manful
guise
mere
feigning
and
dost
thou
fear
me
fear
thee
and
stung
to
a
sudden
heat
theos
made
one
bound
to
her
side
and
seizing
her
slim
wrists
held
them
in
a
grip
so
little
do
i
fear
thee
lysia
so
well
do
i
know
thee
that
in
my
very
caresses
i
would
slay
thee
couldst
thou
thus
be
slain
thou
art
to
me
the
living
presence
of
an
unforgotten
sin
a
sin
most
deadly
sweet
and
unrepented
of
ah
why
dost
thou
tempt
me
and
he
bent
over
her
more
ardently
must
i
not
meet
my
death
at
thy
hands
i
must
and
more
than
death
yet
for
thy
kiss
i
will
risk
hell
for
one
embrace
of
thine
i
will
brave
perdition
ah
cruel
enchantress
and
winding
his
arms
about
her
he
drew
her
close
against
his
breast
and
looked
down
on
the
dreamy
fairness
of
her
face
would
there
were
such
a
thing
as
death
for
souls
like
mine
and
thine
would
we
might
die
most
absolutely
thus
heart
against
heart
never
to
wake
again
and
loathe
eathtypo
or
archaism
other
who
speaks
of
the
cool
sweetness
of
the
grave
the
quiet
ending
of
all
strife
the
unbreaking
seal
of
fate
the
deep
and
stirless
rest
these
things
are
not
and
never
were
for
the
grave
gives
up
its
dead
the
strife
is
forever
and
ever
resumed
the
seal
is
broken
and
in
all
the
laboring
universe
there
shall
be
found
no
rest
and
no
forgetfulness
ah
god
no
forgetfulness
a
shudder
ran
through
his
frame
and
clasping
her
almost
roughly
he
stooped
toward
her
till
his
lips
nearly
touched
hers
thou
art
accursed
lysia
and
i
share
thy
curse
speak
how
shall
we
cheer
each
other
in
the
of
fiends
thou
shall
be
queen
there
and
i
thy
servitor
we
will
make
us
merry
with
the
griefs
of
others
our
music
shall
be
the
dropping
of
lost
women
tears
and
the
groans
of
betrayed
and
tortured
men
and
the
light
around
us
shall
be
quenchless
fire
shall
it
not
be
so
lysia
and
thinkest
thou
that
we
shall
ever
regret
the
loss
of
heaven
the
words
rushed
impetuously
from
his
lips
he
thought
little
and
cared
less
what
he
said
so
long
as
he
could
by
speech
no
matter
how
incoherent
relieve
in
part
the
terrible
oppression
of
vague
memories
that
burdened
his
brain
but
she
listening
drew
herself
swiftly
from
his
embrace
and
stood
up
her
large
eyes
fixed
full
upon
him
with
an
expression
of
wondering
scorn
and
fear
thou
art
mad
she
said
a
quiver
of
alarm
in
her
voice
mad
as
khosrul
and
all
his
brethren
i
offer
thee
love
and
thou
pratest
of
death
life
is
here
in
all
the
fulness
of
the
now
for
thy
delight
and
thou
ravest
of
an
immortal
hereafter
which
is
not
and
can
never
be
why
talk
thus
wildly
why
gaze
on
me
with
so
distraught
a
countenance
but
an
hour
agone
thou
wert
the
model
of
a
cold
discretion
and
quiet
valor
thus
i
had
judged
thee
worthy
of
my
favor
favor
sought
by
many
and
granted
to
few
but
an
thou
dost
wander
amid
such
chaotic
and
unreasoning
fancies
thou
canst
not
serve
me
nor
therefore
canst
thou
win
the
reward
that
would
otherwise
have
awaited
here
she
paused
a
questioning
keen
flashed
from
beneath
her
dark
lashes
he
however
with
pained
wistful
eyes
raised
steadfastly
to
hers
gave
no
sign
of
apology
or
contrition
for
the
disconnected
strangeness
of
his
recent
outburst
only
he
became
gradually
conscious
of
an
inward
growing
calm
as
though
the
divine
voice
that
had
once
soothed
the
angry
waves
of
galilee
were
now
hushing
his
turbulent
emotions
with
a
soft
peace
be
still
she
watched
him
closely
all
at
once
apparently
rendered
impatient
by
his
impassive
attitude
she
came
coaxingly
toward
him
and
laid
one
soft
hand
on
his
shoulder
canst
thou
not
be
happy
theos
she
whispered
gently
happy
as
other
men
are
when
loved
as
thou
art
loved
his
upturned
gaze
rested
on
the
glittering
serpents
heads
that
crowned
her
dusky
tresses
then
on
the
great
eye
that
stared
watchfully
between
her
white
breasts
a
strong
tremor
shook
him
and
he
sighed
happy
as
other
men
are
when
they
love
and
are
deceived
in
love
he
yes
even
so
lysia
i
can
be
happy
she
threw
one
arm
about
him
thou
shalt
not
be
deceived
she
murmured
quickly
thou
shalt
be
honored
above
the
noblest
in
the
realm
thy
dearest
hopes
shall
be
fulfilled
thy
utmost
desires
shall
be
granted
riches
power
fame
all
shall
be
thine
if
thou
wilt
do
my
bidding
she
uttered
the
last
words
with
slow
and
meaning
emphasis
he
met
her
eager
burning
looks
quietly
almost
coldly
the
curious
numb
apathy
of
his
spirit
increased
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
low
and
faint
like
the
voice
of
one
who
speaks
unconsciously
in
his
sleep
what
canst
thou
ask
that
i
will
not
grant
he
said
is
it
not
as
it
was
in
the
old
time
thou
to
command
and
i
to
obey
speak
fair
queen
how
can
i
serve
thee
her
answer
came
swift
and
fierce
as
the
hiss
of
a
snake
kill
the
brief
sentence
leaped
into
his
brain
with
the
swift
fiery
action
of
some
burning
drug
a
red
mist
rose
to
his
eyes
pushing
her
fiercely
from
him
he
started
to
his
feet
in
a
bewildered
sick
horror
kill
kill
the
gracious
smiling
happy
creature
whose
every
minute
of
existence
was
a
joy
kill
the
friend
he
loved
the
poet
he
worshipped
kill
him
ah
god
never
never
he
staggered
backward
dizzily
and
lysia
with
a
sudden
stealthy
spring
like
that
of
her
favorite
tigress
threw
herself
against
his
breast
and
looked
up
at
him
her
splendid
eyes
ablaze
with
passion
her
black
hair
streaming
her
lips
curved
in
a
cruel
smile
and
the
hateful
jewel
on
her
breast
seeming
to
flash
with
ferocious
vindictiveness
kill
him
she
repeated
eagerly
now
in
his
sottish
slumber
now
when
he
hath
lost
sight
of
his
poetmission
in
the
hot
fumes
of
wine
now
when
despite
his
genius
he
hath
made
of
himself
a
thing
lower
than
the
beasts
kill
him
i
will
keep
good
council
and
none
shall
ever
know
who
did
the
deed
he
loves
me
and
i
weary
of
his
love
i
would
have
him
dead
dead
as
but
were
he
to
drain
the
silver
nectar
the
whole
city
would
cry
out
upon
me
for
his
loss
therefore
he
may
not
perish
so
but
an
thou
wilt
slay
him
see
and
she
clung
to
theos
with
the
fierce
tenacity
of
some
wild
animal
all
this
beauty
of
mine
is
thine
thy
days
and
nights
shall
be
dreams
of
rapture
thou
shalt
be
second
to
none
in
thou
shalt
rule
with
me
over
king
and
people
and
we
will
make
the
land
a
for
our
love
and
joy
here
is
thy
and
she
thrust
into
his
hand
a
dagger
the
very
dagger
her
slave
gazra
had
deprived
him
of
when
by
its
prompt
use
he
might
have
mercifully
ended
the
cruel
torments
of
let
thy
stroke
be
strong
and
unfaltering
stab
him
to
the
heart
the
cold
cold
selfish
heart
that
has
never
ached
with
a
throb
of
pity
kill
him
is
an
easy
task
for
lo
how
fast
he
sleeps
and
suddenly
throwing
back
a
rich
gold
curtain
that
depended
from
one
side
of
the
painted
pavilion
she
disclosed
a
small
interior
chamber
hung
with
amber
and
crimson
where
on
a
low
couch
covered
with
crumpled
glistening
draperies
lay
the
king
chief
minstrel
the
dainty
darling
of
women
the
laureate
of
the
realm
sunk
in
a
heavy
drunken
stupor
so
deep
as
to
be
almost
theos
stared
upon
him
amazed
and
bewildered
how
came
he
there
had
he
heard
any
of
the
conversation
that
had
just
passed
between
lysia
and
himself
apparently
not
he
seemed
bound
as
by
chains
in
a
stirless
lethargy
his
posture
was
careless
yet
uneasy
his
brilliant
attire
was
torn
and
otherwise
disordered
and
some
of
his
priceless
jewels
had
fallen
on
the
couch
and
gleamed
here
and
there
like
big
stray
dewdrops
his
face
was
deeply
flushed
and
his
straight
dark
brows
were
knit
frowningly
his
breathing
was
hurried
and
irregular
one
arm
was
thrown
above
his
head
the
other
hung
down
nervelessly
the
relaxed
fingers
hovering
immediately
above
a
costly
jewelled
cup
that
had
dropped
from
his
clasp
two
emptied
wine
flagons
lay
cast
on
the
ground
beside
him
and
he
had
evidently
experienced
the
discomfort
and
feverous
heat
arising
from
intoxication
for
his
silken
vest
was
loosened
as
though
for
greater
ease
and
coolness
thus
leaving
the
smooth
breadth
of
his
chest
bare
and
fully
exposed
to
this
lysia
pointed
with
a
fiendish
glee
as
she
pulled
theos
forward
strike
now
she
why
dost
thou
hesitate
he
looked
at
her
fixedly
the
previous
hot
passion
he
had
felt
for
her
froze
like
ice
within
his
veins
her
fairness
seemed
no
longer
so
distinctly
fair
the
witching
radiance
of
her
eyes
had
lost
its
charm
and
he
motioned
her
from
him
with
a
silent
gesture
of
stern
repugnance
catching
sight
of
the
sheeny
glimmer
of
the
lake
through
the
curtained
entrance
of
the
tent
he
made
a
sudden
spring
thither
dashed
aside
the
draperies
and
flung
the
dagger
he
held
far
out
towards
the
watery
mirror
it
whirled
glittering
through
the
air
and
fell
with
a
quick
splash
into
the
depths
and
gravely
contented
he
turned
upon
her
dauntless
and
serene
in
the
consciousness
of
power
thus
do
i
obey
thee
he
said
in
firm
tones
that
thrilled
through
and
through
with
scorn
and
indignation
thou
evil
beauty
thou
fallen
fairness
kill
nay
sooner
would
i
kill
myself
or
thee
his
life
is
a
glory
to
the
world
his
death
shall
never
profit
thee
for
one
instant
a
lurid
anger
blazed
in
her
face
the
next
her
features
hardened
themselves
into
a
rigidly
cold
expression
of
disdain
though
her
eyes
widened
with
wrathful
wonder
a
low
laugh
broke
from
her
lips
ah
she
cried
art
thou
angel
or
demon
that
thou
darest
defy
me
thou
shouldst
be
either
or
both
to
array
thyself
in
opposition
against
the
high
priestess
of
nagaya
whose
relentless
will
hath
caused
empires
to
totter
and
thrones
to
fall
his
life
a
glory
to
the
world
and
she
pointed
to
recumbent
figure
with
a
gesture
of
loathing
and
contempt
his
the
life
of
a
drunken
voluptuary
a
sensual
egotist
a
poet
who
sees
no
genius
save
his
own
and
who
condemns
all
vice
save
that
which
he
himself
indulges
in
a
laurelled
swine
a
false
god
of
art
and
for
him
thou
dost
reject
me
ah
thou
fool
and
her
splendid
eyes
shot
forth
resentful
thou
rash
unthinking
headstrong
fool
thou
knowest
not
what
thou
hast
lost
aye
guard
thy
friend
as
thou
wilt
thou
dost
guard
him
at
thine
own
peril
think
not
that
he
or
thou
shall
escape
my
vengeance
what
dost
thou
play
the
heroic
with
me
thou
who
art
man
and
therefore
no
hero
for
men
are
cowards
all
except
when
in
the
heat
of
battle
they
follow
the
pursuit
of
their
own
brief
glory
poltroons
and
knaves
in
spirit
incapable
of
resisting
their
own
passions
and
wilt
thou
pretend
to
be
stronger
than
the
rest
wilt
thou
take
up
arms
against
thyself
and
destiny
thou
madman
and
her
lithe
form
quivered
with
concentrated
rage
thou
puny
wretch
that
dost
first
clutch
at
and
then
refuse
my
love
thou
who
dost
oppose
thy
miserable
force
to
the
fate
that
hunts
thee
down
thou
who
dost
gaze
at
me
with
such
grave
eyes
beware
beware
of
me
i
hate
thee
as
i
hate
all
men
i
will
humble
thee
as
i
have
humbled
the
proudest
of
thy
sex
wheresoever
thou
goest
i
will
track
thee
out
and
torture
thee
and
thou
shalt
die
miserably
lingeringly
horribly
as
i
would
have
every
man
die
could
i
fulfil
my
utmost
heart
desire
be
free
but
as
thou
livest
i
will
claim
thee
like
an
enraged
queen
she
stood
one
white
jewelled
arm
stretched
forth
menacingly
her
bosom
heaving
and
her
face
aflame
with
wrath
but
theos
leaning
against
couch
heard
her
with
as
much
impassiveness
as
though
her
threatening
voice
were
but
the
sound
of
an
idle
wind
only
when
she
ceased
he
turned
his
untroubled
gaze
calmly
and
full
upon
her
and
then
to
his
own
infinite
surprise
she
shivered
and
shrank
backwards
while
over
her
countenance
flitted
a
vague
undefinable
almost
spectral
expression
of
terror
he
saw
it
and
swift
words
came
at
once
to
his
lips
words
that
uttered
themselves
without
premeditation
lysia
thou
shalt
claim
nothing
he
said
in
a
still
composed
voice
that
to
himself
had
something
strange
and
unearthly
in
its
tone
not
even
a
grave
get
thee
hence
pray
to
thy
gods
if
thou
hast
any
for
truly
there
is
need
of
prayer
thou
shalt
not
harm
his
love
for
thee
may
be
his
present
curse
but
it
shall
not
work
his
future
ruin
as
for
me
though
canst
not
slay
me
lysia
seeing
that
to
myself
i
am
dead
already
dead
yet
alive
in
thought
and
thou
dost
now
seem
to
my
soul
but
the
shadow
of
a
past
crime
the
ghost
of
a
temptation
overcome
and
baffled
ah
thou
sweet
sin
here
he
suddenly
moved
toward
her
and
caught
her
hands
hard
looking
fearlessly
the
while
at
her
flushed
face
i
do
confess
that
i
have
loved
thee
i
do
own
that
i
have
found
thee
fair
but
now
now
that
i
see
thee
as
thou
art
in
all
the
nameless
horror
of
thy
beauty
i
do
entreat
and
his
accents
sank
to
a
low
yet
fervent
supplication
i
do
entreat
the
most
high
god
that
i
may
be
released
from
thee
forever
she
gazed
upon
him
with
dilated
terrified
eyes
and
he
dimly
wondered
as
he
looked
why
she
should
seem
to
fear
him
not
a
word
did
she
utter
in
reply
step
by
step
she
retreated
from
him
her
glittering
exquisite
form
grew
paler
and
more
indistinct
in
outline
and
presently
catching
at
the
gold
curtain
that
divided
the
two
pavilions
she
paused
still
regarding
him
steadfastly
an
evil
smile
curved
her
lips
a
smile
of
cold
menace
and
derisive
scorn
the
jewel
on
her
breast
darted
forth
vivid
flashes
of
azure
and
green
and
gray
the
snakes
in
her
hair
seemed
to
rise
and
hiss
at
him
and
then
with
an
awful
unspoken
threat
written
resolvedly
on
every
line
of
her
fair
features
she
let
the
gold
draperies
fall
softly
and
so
disappeared
leaving
him
alone
with
he
stood
for
a
moment
half
amazed
half
perplexed
then
drawing
a
deep
breath
he
pushed
the
clustering
hair
off
his
forehead
with
an
unconscious
gesture
of
relief
she
was
gone
and
he
felt
as
though
he
had
gained
a
victory
over
something
though
he
knew
not
what
the
cold
air
from
the
lake
blew
refreshingly
on
his
heated
brow
and
a
thousand
odors
from
and
jessamine
floated
caressingly
about
him
the
night
was
very
still
and
approaching
the
opening
of
the
tent
he
looked
out
there
in
the
soft
sky
gloom
moved
the
majestic
procession
of
the
undiscovered
worlds
seeming
to
be
no
more
than
bright
dots
on
the
measureless
expanse
of
pure
ether
there
low
on
the
horizon
the
yellow
moon
swooned
languidly
downwards
in
a
bed
of
fleecy
cloud
the
drowsy
chirrup
of
a
dreaming
bird
came
softly
now
and
again
from
the
shadows
of
the
heavy
foliage
and
the
lilies
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
nodded
mysteriously
among
the
slow
ripples
like
wise
white
elves
whispering
to
one
another
some
secret
of
fairyland
and
still
slept
and
still
that
puzzled
and
weary
frown
darkened
the
fairness
of
his
broad
brow
and
coming
back
to
his
side
theos
stood
watching
him
with
a
yearning
and
sorrowful
wistfulness
gathering
up
the
jewels
that
had
fallen
out
of
his
dress
he
replaced
them
one
by
one
and
strove
to
the
tossed
and
tumbled
garb
as
best
he
might
while
he
was
thus
occupied
his
hand
happened
to
touch
the
tablet
that
hung
by
a
silver
chain
from
the
laureate
belt
he
glanced
at
it
it
was
covered
with
fine
writing
and
turning
it
more
toward
the
light
he
soon
made
out
four
stanzas
perfectly
rhymed
and
smoothly
flowing
as
a
harmony
he
read
them
slowly
with
a
faint
smile
he
recognized
them
as
his
own
they
were
part
of
a
poem
he
had
long
ago
begun
yet
have
never
finished
and
now
had
the
same
idea
moreover
he
had
chosen
the
same
rhythm
the
same
words
well
after
all
what
did
it
matter
nothing
he
felt
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
had
ceased
to
care
for
his
own
personality
or
interests
had
become
dearer
to
him
than
himself
his
immediate
anxiety
was
centered
in
the
question
of
how
to
rouse
his
friend
from
the
torpor
in
which
he
lay
and
get
him
out
of
this
voluptuous
garden
of
delights
before
any
lurking
danger
could
overtake
him
full
of
this
intention
he
presently
ventured
to
draw
aside
the
curtain
that
concealed
lysia
pavilion
and
looking
in
he
saw
to
his
great
relief
that
she
was
no
longer
there
her
couch
of
crushed
roses
scented
the
place
with
heavy
fragrance
and
the
ruby
lamp
was
still
burning
but
she
herself
had
departed
now
was
the
time
for
escape
thought
theos
now
while
she
was
absent
now
if
could
be
persuaded
to
come
away
he
might
reach
his
own
palace
in
safety
and
once
there
he
could
be
warned
of
the
death
that
threatened
him
through
the
treachery
of
the
woman
he
loved
but
would
he
believe
in
or
accept
the
warning
at
any
rate
some
effort
must
be
made
to
rescue
him
and
theos
without
more
ado
bent
above
him
and
called
aloud

uneasily
and
smiled
in

thickly

worthy
toast
and
merits
a
deeper
draught
of
mellow
vintage
fill

the
world

but
the
drunken
dream
of
a

but
the

a
shadow

us

drown

in
wine
and
love
and
music
wine
and

his
voice
broke
in
a
short
smothered
sigh
theos
surveyed
him
with
mingled
impatience
pity
and
something
of
repulsion
and
there
was
a
warm
touch
of
indignant
remonstrance
in
his
tone
when
he
called
again
rouse
thee
man
for
very
shame
sake
art
thou
dead
to
the
honor
of
thy
calling
that
thou
dost
wilfully
consent
to
be
the
victim
of
and
debauchery
o
thou
frail
soul
how
hast
thou
quenched
the
heavenly
essence
within
thee
why
wilt
thou
be
thus
and
all
inglorious
and
he
shook
him
violently
by
the
arm
up
up
thou
truant
to
the
faith
of
art
i
will
not
let
thee
drowse
the
hours
away
in
such
unseemliness
wake
for
the
night
is
almost
past
the
morning
is
at
hand
and
danger
threatens
thee
wouldst
thou
be
found
here
drunk
at
sunrise
this
time
was
thoroughly
disturbed
and
with
a
half
uttered
oath
he
sat
up
pushed
his
tumbled
hair
from
his
brows
and
stared
at
his
companion
in
blinking
sleepy
wonderment
now
by
my
soul
thou
art
a
most
unmannerly
ruffian
he
said
pettishly
yet
with
a
vacant
smile
what
question
didst
thou
bawl
unmusically
in
mine
ear
will
i
be
drunk
at
sunrise
aye
and
at
sunset
too
sir
malapert
if
that
will
satisfy
thee
hast
thou
been
grudged
sufficient
wine
that
thou
dost
envy
me
my
slumber
what
dost
thou
here
where
hast
thou
been
and
becoming
more
conscious
of
his
surroundings
he
suddenly
stood
up
and
catching
hold
of
theos
to
support
himself
gazed
upon
him
suspiciously
with
very
dim
and
bloodshot
eyes
art
thou
fresh
from
the
arms
of
the
ravishing
nelida
is
she
not
fair
a
choice
morsel
for
a
lover
banquet
doth
she
not
dance
a
madness
into
the
veins
aye
aye
she
was
reserved
for
thee
my
jolly
roysterer
but
thou
art
not
the
first
nor
wilt
thou
be
the
last
that
hath
revelled
in
her
store
of
charms
no
matter
and
he
laughed
foolishly
better
a
wild
dancer
than
a
tame
prude
here
he
looked
about
him
in
confused
where
is
lysia
was
she
not
here
a
moment
since
and
he
staggered
toward
the
neighboring
pavilion
and
dashed
the
dividing
curtain
aside
lysia
lysia
he
shouted
noisily
then
receiving
no
answer
he
flung
himself
down
on
the
vacant
couch
of
roses
and
gathering
up
a
handful
of
the
crumpled
flowers
kissed
them
passionately
the
witch
has
flown
he
said
laughing
again
that
mirthless
stupid
laugh
as
he
spoke
she
doth
love
to
tantalize
me
thus
tell
me
what
dost
thou
think
of
her
is
she
not
a
peerless
moon
of
womanhood
doth
she
not
eclipse
all
known
or
imaginable
beauty
aye
and
i
will
tell
thee
a
secret
she
is
mine
mine
from
the
dark
tresses
down
to
the
dainty
feet
mine
all
mine
so
long
as
i
shall
please
to
call
her
so
notwithstanding
that
the
foolish
people
of
think
she
is
impervious
to
love
holy
and
bah
as
if
a
woman
ever
was
but
mark
you
though
she
loves
me
me
crowned
laureate
of
the
realm
she
loves
no
other
man
and
why
because
no
other
man
is
found
half
so
worthy
of
love
all
men
must
love
her
nirjalis
loved
her
and
he
is
dead
because
of
overmuch
presumption
and
many
there
be
who
shall
still
die
likewise
for
love
of
her
but
am
her
chosen
and
elected
one
her
faith
is
mine
her
heart
is
mine
her
very
soul
is
mine
mine
i
would
swear
though
all
the
gods
of
the
past
present
and
future
denied
her
constancy
here
his
uncertain
wandering
gaze
met
the
grave
pained
and
almost
stern
regard
of
theos
why
dost
thou
stare
thus
upon
me
he
demanded
art
thou
not
my
friend
and
worshipper
wilt
preach
wilt
moralize
on
the
folly
of
the
time
the
vices
of
the
age
thou
lookest
it
but
prithee
hold
thy
peace
an
thou
lovest
me
we
can
but
live
and
die
and
there
an
end
all
over
with
the
best
and
wisest
of
us
soon
let
us
be
merry
while
we
may
and
he
tossed
a
cluster
of
roses
playfully
in
the
air
catching
them
as
they
fell
again
in
a
soft
shower
of
severed
fluttering
pink
and
white
petals
theos
listened
to
his
rambling
unguarded
words
with
a
sense
of
acute
personal
sorrow
here
was
a
man
young
handsome
and
endowed
with
the
rarest
gift
of
nature
a
great
poetic
genius
a
man
who
had
attained
in
early
manhood
the
highest
worldly
fame
together
with
the
friendship
of
a
king
and
the
love
of
a
people
yet
what
was
he
in
himself
a
mere
petty
egoist
a
poor
deluded
fool
the
unresisting
prey
of
his
own
passions
the
besotted
slave
of
a
treacherous
woman
and
the
voluntary
degrader
of
his
own
life
what
was
the
use
of
genius
then
if
it
could
not
aid
one
to
overcome
self
what
the
worth
of
fame
if
it
were
not
made
to
serve
as
a
bright
incentive
and
noble
example
to
others
of
less
renown
as
this
thought
passed
across
his
mind
theos
sighed
he
felt
curiously
ashamed
and
humiliated
through
and
solely
for
sake
at
present
however
his
chief
anxiety
was
to
get
his
friend
safely
out
of
pavilion
before
she
should
return
to
it
and
his
spirit
chafed
within
him
at
each
moment
of
enforced
delay
come
come
he
said
at
last
gently
yet
with
persuasive
come
away
from
this
place
the
feast
is
over
the
fair
ones
are
gone
why
should
we
linger
thou
art
believe
me
is
time
thou
wert
home
and
at
rest
lean
upon
me
so
that
is
well
this
as
the
other
rose
unsteadily
to
his
feet
and
lurched
heavily
against
him
now
let
me
guide
thee
though
of
a
truth
i
know
not
the
way
through
this
wondrous
woodland
maze
canst
tell
me
whither
we
should
turn
or
hast
thou
no
remembrance
of
the
nearest
road
to
thine
own
dwelling
thus
speaking
he
managed
to
lead
his
stupefied
companion
out
of
the
tent
into
the
cool
dewy
garden
where
feeling
somewhat
refreshed
by
the
breath
of
the
night
wind
blowing
on
his
face
straightened
himself
and
made
an
absurd
attempt
to
look
exceedingly
dignified
nay
an
thou
wilt
depart
with
such
scant
ceremony
he
grumbled
peevishly
get
thee
thence
and
find
out
the
road
as
best
thou
mayest
why
should
i
aid
thee
for
myself
i
am
well
contented
here
to
remain
and
sleep
no
better
couch
can
the
poet
have
than
this
moss
and
he
waved
his
arm
with
a
grandiloquent
gesture
no
grander
canopy
than
this
heaven
leave
me
for
my
eyes
are
wondrous
heavy
and
i
would
fain
slumber
undisturbed
till
the
break
of
day
by
my
soul
thou
art
a
rough
companion
and
he
struggled
violently
to
release
himself
from
theos
resolute
and
compelling
where
wouldst
thou
drag
me
out
of
danger
and
the
shadow
of
death
replied
theos
thy
life
is
threatened
and
i
will
not
see
thee
slain
if
thou
canst
not
guard
thyself
then
i
must
guard
thee
come
delay
no
longer
i
beseech
thee
do
i
not
love
thee
friend
and
would
i
urge
thee
thus
without
good
reason
o
thou
misguided
soul
thou
dost
most
ignorantly
court
destruction
but
if
my
strength
can
shield
thee
thou
shalt
not
die
before
thy
time
and
he
hurried
his
pace
half
leading
half
carrying
the
reluctant
poet
who
however
was
too
drowsy
and
lethargic
to
do
more
than
feebly
resent
his
action
and
thus
they
went
together
along
a
broad
path
that
seemed
to
extend
itself
in
a
direct
line
straight
across
the
grounds
but
which
in
reality
turned
and
twisted
about
through
all
manner
of
perplexing
nooks
and
corners
now
under
trees
so
closely
interwoven
that
not
a
glimpse
of
the
sky
could
be
seen
through
the
dense
darkness
of
the
crossed
boughs
now
by
gorgeous
banks
of
roses
pale
yellow
and
white
that
looked
like
frozen
foam
in
the
dying
glitter
of
the
moon
now
beneath
trellis
work
overgrown
with
jasamine
and
peopled
by
thousands
of
dancing
while
at
every
undulating
bend
or
sharp
angle
in
the
road
theos
heart
beat
quickly
in
fear
lest
they
should
meet
some
armed
retainer
or
spy
of
lysia
who
might
interrupt
their
progress
or
perhaps
peremptorily
forbid
their
departure
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
or
seemed
likely
to
happen
the
splendid
gardens
were
all
apparently
deserted
and
not
a
living
soul
was
anywhere
to
be
seen
presently
through
an
archway
of
twisted
magnolia
stems
theos
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
illuminated
pool
with
the
marble
nymph
in
its
centre
which
had
so
greatly
fascinated
him
on
his
first
arrival
and
he
pressed
forward
eagerly
knowing
that
now
they
could
not
be
very
far
from
the
gates
of
exit
all
at
once
the
tall
figure
of
a
man
clad
in
complete
armor
came
into
sudden
view
between
some
heavily
drooping
boughs
it
stood
out
for
a
second
and
then
hurriedly
disappeared
muffling
its
face
in
a
black
mantle
as
it
fled
not
however
before
theos
had
recognized
those
dark
haughty
features
those
relentless
brows
and
that
stern
almost
lurid
smile
and
with
a
quick
convulsive
movement
he
grasped
his
companion
arm
hist
he
whispered
saw
you
not
the
king
started
as
though
he
had
received
a
dagger
thrust
his
very
lips
turned
pale
in
the
moonlight
the
king
he
echoed
with
an
accent
of
incredulous
amazement
the
king
thou
art
mad
it
could
not
be
where
didst
thou
see
him
in
silence
theos
pointed
to
the
dark
shrubbery
sahluma
shook
himself
free
of
his
friend
hold
and
standing
erect
gazed
in
the
direction
indicated
with
an
expression
of
mingled
fear
distrust
bewilderment
and
wrath
on
his
features
he
was
suddenly
but
effectually
sobered
and
all
the
delicate
beauty
of
his
face
came
back
like
the
rich
tone
of
a
fine
picture
restored
his
hand
fell
instinctively
toward
the
jewelled
hilt
of
the
poniard
at
his
belt
the
king
he
muttered
under
his
breath
the
king
is
khosrul
right
after
all
and
must
one
learn
wisdom
from
a
madman
by
my
soul
if
i
thought
here
he
checked
himself
abruptly
and
turned
upon
theos
nay
thou
art
deceived
he
said
with
a
forced
was
not
the
king
was
some
rash
unknown
intruder
whose
worthless
life
must
pay
the
penalty
of
trespass
and
he
drew
his
flashing
weapon
from
his
this
shall
unmask
him
and
thou
my
friend
get
thee
away
and
home
fear
nothing
for
my
safety
go
hence
and
quickly
i
follow
thee
anon
and
before
theos
could
utter
a
word
of
warning
he
plunged
impetuously
into
the
innermost
recess
of
the
dense
foliage
behind
which
the
mysterious
armed
figure
had
just
vanished
and
was
instantly
lost
to
sight
called
theos
passionately
come
back
whether
wilt
thou
go
only
silence
answered
him
silence
rendered
even
more
profound
by
the
subdued
faint
rustling
of
the
wind
among
the
leaves
and
agitated
by
all
manner
of
vague
alarms
and
dreary
forebodings
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
hesitating
as
to
whether
he
should
follow
his
friend
or
no
some
instinct
stronger
than
himself
however
persuaded
him
that
it
would
be
best
to
continue
his
road
he
therefore
went
on
slowly
hoping
against
hope
that
might
still
rejoin
him
but
herein
he
was
disappointed
he
waited
a
little
while
near
the
illuminated
water
dreamily
eying
the
beautiful
marble
nymph
crowned
with
her
wreath
of
amethystine
flame
she
resembled
lysia
somewhat
he
thought
only
this
was
a
frozen
fairness
while
the
peerless
charms
of
the
cruel
high
priestess
were
those
of
living
flesh
and
blood
yet
the
remembrance
of
all
the
tenderly
witching
loveliness
that
might
have
been
his
had
he
slain
at
her
bidding
now
moved
him
neither
to
regret
nor
lover
passion
but
only
touched
his
spirit
with
a
sense
of
bitter
repulsion
while
a
strange
pity
for
the
poet
laureate
infatuation
awoke
in
him
pity
that
any
man
could
be
so
reckless
blind
and
desperate
as
to
love
a
woman
for
her
mere
perishable
beauty
of
body
and
never
care
to
know
whether
the
graces
of
her
mind
were
equal
to
the
graces
of
her
form
we
men
have
yet
to
learn
the
true
meaning
of
love
he
mused
rather
sadly
we
consider
it
from
the
selfish
standpoint
of
our
own
unbridled
passions
we
willingly
accept
a
fair
face
as
the
visible
reflex
of
a
fair
soul
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
we
are
utterly
mistaken
we
begin
wrongly
and
we
therefore
end
miserably
we
should
love
a
woman
for
what
she
is
and
not
for
what
she
appears
to
be
yet
how
are
we
to
fathom
her
nature
how
shall
we
guess
how
can
we
decide
are
we
fooled
by
an
evil
fate
or
do
we
in
our
loves
and
marriages
deliberately
fool
ourselves
he
pondered
the
question
hazily
without
arriving
at
any
satisfactory
answer
and
as
still
did
not
return
he
resumed
his
slow
unguided
and
solitary
way
he
presently
found
himself
in
a
close
boscage
of
tall
trees
straight
as
pines
and
covered
with
very
large
thick
leaves
that
exhaled
a
peculiarly
faint
odor
and
here
pausing
abruptly
he
looked
anxiously
about
him
this
was
certainly
not
the
avenue
through
which
he
had
previously
come
with
and
he
soon
felt
uncomfortably
convinced
that
he
had
somehow
taken
the
wrong
path
perceiving
a
low
iron
gate
standing
open
in
front
of
him
he
went
thither
and
discovered
a
steep
stone
staircase
leading
down
down
into
what
seemed
to
be
a
vast
well
black
and
empty
as
a
starless
midnight
peering
doubtfully
into
this
gloomy
pit
he
fancied
he
saw
a
small
blue
flame
wavering
to
and
fro
at
the
bottom
and
pricked
by
a
sudden
impulse
of
curiosity
he
made
up
his
mind
to
descend
he
went
down
slowly
and
cautiously
counting
each
step
as
he
placed
his
foot
upon
it
there
were
a
hundred
steps
in
all
and
at
the
end
the
light
he
had
seen
completely
vanished
leaving
him
in
the
most
profound
darkness
confused
and
startled
he
stretched
out
his
hands
instinctively
as
a
blind
man
might
do
and
thus
came
in
contact
with
something
sharp
pointed
and
icy
cold
like
the
frozen
talon
of
a
dead
bird
shuddering
at
the
touch
he
recoiled
and
was
about
to
try
and
grope
his
way
up
the
stairs
again
when
the
light
once
more
appeared
this
time
casting
a
thin
slanting
azure
blaze
through
the
dense
shadows
and
he
was
able
gradually
to
realize
the
horrors
of
the
place
into
which
he
had
unwittingly
adventured
one
faint
cry
escaped
his
lips
and
then
he
was
mute
and
motionless
chilled
to
the
very
heart
a
great
awe
and
speechless
dread
overwhelmed
him
for
he
a
living
man
and
fully
conscious
of
life
stood
alone
surrounded
by
a
ghastly
multitude
of
skeletons
skeletons
bleached
white
as
ivory
and
glistening
with
a
smooth
moist
polish
as
of
pearl
shoulder
to
shoulder
arm
against
arm
they
stood
placed
upright
and
as
close
together
as
possible
every
bony
hand
held
a
rusty
spear
and
on
every
skull
gleamed
a
small
metal
casque
inscribed
with
hieroglyphic
characters
thousands
of
eyeless
sockets
seemed
to
turn
toward
him
in
blank
yet
questioning
wonder
suggesting
awfully
to
his
mind
that
the
eyes
might
still
be
there
fallen
far
back
into
the
head
from
whence
they
yet
saw
themselves
unseen
thousands
of
grinning
jaws
seemed
to
mock
at
him
as
he
leaned
against
the
damp
portal
he
fancied
he
could
hear
the
derisive
laugh
of
death
echoing
horribly
through
those
dimly
distant
arches
this
this
he
thought
wildly
was
the
sequel
to
his
brief
and
wretched
history
for
this
one
end
he
had
wandered
out
of
the
ways
of
his
former
life
and
forgotten
almost
all
he
had
ever
known
here
was
the
only
poor
finale
an
and
god
could
contrive
for
the
close
of
his
marvelous
symphony
of
creative
love
and
light
ah
cruel
cruel
then
there
was
no
justice
no
pity
no
compensation
in
all
the
width
and
breadth
of
the
universe
if
death
indeed
was
the
end
of
everything
and
god
or
the
great
force
called
by
that
name
was
nothing
but
a
tyrant
and
torturer
of
his
helpless
creature
man
so
thinking
dully
and
feebly
he
pressed
his
hand
on
his
aching
eyes
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
that
grim
crowd
of
fleshless
rigid
shapes
that
everywhere
confronted
him
the
darkness
of
the
place
seemed
to
descend
upon
him
crushingly
and
reeling
forward
he
would
have
fallen
in
a
swoon
had
not
a
strong
hand
suddenly
grasped
his
arm
and
supported
him
firmly
upright
how
now
my
son
said
a
grave
musical
voice
that
had
in
it
a
certain
touch
of
compassion
what
ails
thee
and
why
art
thou
here
art
thou
condemned
to
die
or
dost
thou
seek
an
escape
from
death
making
an
effort
to
overcome
the
sick
giddiness
that
confused
his
brain
he
looked
up
a
bright
lamp
flared
in
his
eyes
contrasting
so
dazzlingly
with
the
surrounding
gloom
that
for
a
moment
he
was
by
its
brilliancy
but
presently
steadying
his
gaze
he
was
able
to
discern
the
dark
outline
of
a
tall
figure
standing
beside
him
the
figure
of
an
old
man
whose
severe
and
dignified
aspect
at
first
reminded
him
somewhat
of
the
prophet
khosrul
only
that
khosrul
rugged
features
had
borne
the
impress
of
patient
bitter
suffering
and
the
personage
who
now
confronted
him
had
a
face
so
calm
and
seriously
impassive
that
it
might
have
been
taken
for
that
of
one
newly
dead
from
whose
lineaments
all
traces
of
earthly
passion
had
forever
been
smoothed
away
art
thou
condemned
to
die
or
dost
thou
seek
an
escape
from
death
the
question
had
or
seemed
to
have
a
curious
significance
it
reiterated
itself
almost
noisily
in
his
ears
his
mind
was
troubled
by
vague
surmises
and
dreary
forebodings
speech
was
difficult
to
him
and
his
lips
quivered
pathetically
when
he
at
last
found
force
to
frame
his
struggling
thoughts
into
language
escape
from
death
he
murmured
gazing
wildly
around
as
he
spoke
on
the
vast
skeleton
crowd
that
encircled
old
man
dost
thou
also
talk
of
impossibilities
wilt
thou
also
maintain
a
creed
of
hope
when
naught
awaits
us
but
despair
art
thou
fooled
likewise
with
the
glimmering
of
a
future
escape
from
death
how
and
where
art
not
these
dry
and
vacant
forms
sufficiently
eloquent
of
the
of
decay
and
he
caught
his
unknown
companion
almost
fiercely
by
the
long
robe
while
a
sound
that
was
half
a
sob
and
half
a
sigh
came
from
his
aching
lo
you
how
emptily
they
stare
upon
us
how
is
their
smile
poor
poor
frail
shapes
nay
who
would
think
these
hollow
shells
of
bone
had
once
been
men
men
with
strong
hearts
blood
and
throbbing
pulses
men
of
thought
and
action
who
maybe
did
most
nobly
bear
themselves
in
life
upon
the
earth
and
yet
are
now
forgotten
men
ah
great
heaven
can
it
be
that
these
most
rueful
loathly
things
have
loved
and
hoped
and
labored
through
all
their
days
for
such
an
end
as
this
escape
from
death
alas
there
is
no
escape
is
evident
we
all
must
die
die
and
with
eyes
unlearn
our
knowledge
of
the
sun
the
stars
the
marvels
of
the
universe
for
us
no
more
shall
the
flowers
bloom
or
the
sweet
birds
sing
the
poem
of
the
world
will
write
itself
anew
in
every
roseate
flushing
of
the
dawn
but
we
we
who
have
joyed
therein
we
who
have
sung
the
praises
of
the
light
the
harmonies
of
wind
and
sea
the
tunefulness
of
woods
and
fields
we
whose
ambitious
thoughts
have
soared
through
unseen
empyreans
of
space
there
to
drink
in
a
honeyed
hope
of
heaven
we
shall
be
but
dead
mute
cold
and
stirless
as
deep
undug
stones
dead
ah
god
thou
utmost
cruelty
and
in
a
sudden
access
of
grief
and
passion
he
raised
one
hand
and
shook
it
aloft
with
a
menacing
gesture
would
i
might
look
upon
thee
face
to
face
and
rebuke
thee
for
thy
merciless
injustice
he
spoke
wildly
as
though
possessed
by
a
sort
of
frenzy
his
unknown
companion
heard
him
with
an
air
of
mild
and
pitying
patience
peace
peace
blaspheme
not
the
most
high
my
son
he
said
gently
yet
reproachfully
distraught
as
thou
dost
seem
with
some
strange
misery
and
sick
with
fears
forbear
thine
ignorant
fury
against
him
who
hath
for
love
dear
sake
alone
created
thee
control
thy
soul
in
patience
surely
thou
art
afflicted
by
thine
own
vain
and
false
imaginings
which
for
a
time
contort
and
darken
the
clear
light
of
truth
why
dost
thou
thus
disquiet
thyself
concerning
the
end
of
life
seeing
that
verily
it
hath
no
end
and
that
what
we
men
call
death
is
not
a
conclusion
but
merely
a
new
beginning
waste
not
thy
pity
on
these
skeleton
forms
the
empty
dwellings
of
martial
spirits
long
since
fled
as
well
weep
over
fallen
husks
of
corn
from
which
the
blossoms
have
sprung
right
joyously
upward
this
world
is
but
our
roadside
hostelry
wherein
we
sojourners
tarry
for
one
brief
restless
night
why
regret
the
loss
of
the
poor
refreshment
offered
thee
here
when
there
are
a
thousand
better
feasts
awaiting
thee
elsewhere
on
thy
way
come
let
me
lead
thee
hence
this
place
is
known
as
the
passage
of
the
tombs
and
communicates
with
the
inner
court
of
the
sacred
temple
and
if
as
i
fear
thou
art
a
stray
fugitive
from
the
accursed
lysia
band
of
lovers
thou
mayest
be
tracked
hither
and
quickly
slain
come
i
will
show
thee
a
secret
labyrinth
by
which
thou
canst
gain
the
embankment
of
the
river
and
from
thence
betake
thyself
speedily
home
if
thou
hast
a
home
here
he
paused
and
a
keen
questioning
glance
flashed
in
his
dark
eyes
but
notwithstanding
thy
fluency
of
speech
and
fashion
of
attire
methinks
thou
hast
the
lost
and
solitary
air
of
one
who
is
a
stranger
in
the
city
of
theos
sighed
a
stranger
i
am
indeed
he
said
drearily
a
stranger
to
my
very
self
and
all
my
former
belongings
ask
me
no
questions
good
father
for
as
i
live
i
can
not
answer
them
i
am
oppressed
by
a
nameless
and
mysterious
suffering
my
brain
is
darkened
my
thoughts
but
and
never
wholly
uttered
and
i
i
who
once
deemed
human
intelligence
and
reason
am
now
compelled
to
use
that
reason
reasonlessly
and
to
work
with
that
intelligence
in
helpless
ignorance
as
to
what
end
my
mental
toil
shall
serve
woeful
and
strange
it
is
yet
true
i
am
as
a
broken
straw
in
a
whirlwind
or
the
pale
ghost
of
my
own
identity
groping
for
things
forgotten
in
a
land
of
shadows
i
know
not
whence
i
came
nor
whither
i
go
nay
do
not
fear
me
i
am
not
mad
i
am
conscious
of
my
life
my
strength
and
physical
and
though
i
may
speak
wildly
i
harbor
no
toward
any
man
my
quarrel
is
with
god
alone
he
paused
then
resumed
in
calmer
accents
you
judge
rightly
reverend
sir
i
am
a
stranger
in
i
entered
the
this
morning
when
the
sun
was
high
and
ere
noon
i
found
courteous
welcome
and
princely
shelter
i
am
the
guest
of
the
poet
the
old
man
looked
at
him
half
compassionately
ah
is
thine
host
he
said
with
a
touch
of
melancholy
surprise
in
his
tone
then
wherefore
art
thou
here
here
in
this
dark
abode
where
none
may
linger
and
escape
with
life
how
earnest
thou
within
the
bounds
of
lysid
fatal
pleasaunce
has
the
laureate
friendship
thus
misguided
thee
theos
hesitated
before
replying
he
was
again
moved
by
that
curious
instinctive
dread
of
hearing
name
associated
with
any
sort
of
reproach
and
his
voice
had
a
somewhat
defiant
ring
as
he
answered
nay
surely
i
am
neither
child
nor
woman
that
i
should
weakly
yield
to
guidance
or
misleading
some
trifling
matter
of
remains
to
me
in
spite
of
mine
affliction
and
that
i
have
supped
with
at
the
palace
of
the
high
priestess
has
been
as
much
my
choice
as
his
example
who
among
men
would
turn
aside
from
high
feasting
and
mirthful
company
not
i
believe
me
and
desires
herein
were
but
the
reflex
of
mine
own
we
came
together
through
the
woodland
and
parted
but
a
moment
since
he
stopped
abruptly
startled
by
a
sudden
clash
as
of
steel
and
the
of
approaching
feet
his
aged
companion
caught
him
by
the
arm
hush
he
not
a
word
not
a
breath
or
thy
life
must
pay
the
penalty
quick
follow
me
close
step
softly
there
is
a
near
at
hand
where
we
may
couch
unseen
till
these
dread
visitants
pass
by
moving
stealthily
and
with
anxious
precaution
he
led
the
way
to
a
niche
hollowed
deeply
out
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
and
turning
his
lamp
aside
so
that
not
the
faintest
glimmer
of
it
could
be
perceived
he
took
theos
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
into
what
seemed
to
be
a
huge
cavernous
recess
utterly
dark
and
icy
cold
here
crouching
low
in
the
furthest
gloom
they
both
waited
silently
theos
ignorant
as
to
the
cause
of
the
sudden
alarm
and
wondering
vaguely
what
strange
new
circumstance
was
about
to
happen
the
measured
of
feet
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
in
another
moment
the
flare
of
smoking
torches
illumined
the
vaulted
passage
casting
many
a
ruddy
flicker
and
flash
on
the
whiteness
of
the
vast
skeleton
army
that
stood
with
such
grim
and
pallid
patience
as
though
waiting
for
a
marching
signal
presently
there
appeared
a
number
of
men
carrying
short
axes
stained
with
blood
coarse
savage
brutes
all
whose
lowering
faces
bore
the
marks
of
a
thousand
unrepented
crimes
these
were
followed
by
four
tall
personages
clad
in
flowing
white
robes
and
closely
masked
and
finally
there
came
a
band
of
black
slaves
clothed
in
vivid
scarlet
dragging
between
them
two
writhing
bleeding
creatures
one
a
man
the
other
a
girl
in
her
earliest
youth
both
convulsed
by
the
evident
last
agonies
of
death
arrived
at
the
centre
of
that
part
of
the
vault
where
the
skeleton
crowd
was
thickest
this
horrible
cortege
halted
while
one
of
the
masked
personages
undid
from
his
girdle
a
large
bunch
of
keys
and
now
theos
watching
everything
with
dreadful
interest
from
the
obscure
corner
where
he
was
thanks
to
his
unknown
friend
successfully
concealed
perceived
for
the
first
time
a
low
iron
door
heavily
barred
and
surmounted
by
sharp
spikes
as
long
as
drawn
daggers
when
this
dreary
portal
was
with
many
a
jarring
groan
and
clang
slowly
opened
such
an
awful
cry
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
tortured
man
as
might
have
wrung
compassion
from
the
most
hardened
tyrant
wresting
himself
fiercely
out
of
the
grasp
of
the
slaves
who
held
him
he
struggled
to
his
feet
while
the
blood
poured
from
the
cruel
wounds
that
were
inflicted
all
over
his
body
and
raising
his
manacled
hands
aloft
he
mercy
mercy
not
for
me
but
for
her
for
her
my
love
my
life
my
tenderest
little
one
what
is
her
crime
ye
fiends
why
do
ye
deem
love
a
sin
and
passion
a
dishonor
shall
there
be
no
more
because
ye
are
cold
spare
her
she
is
so
young
so
fond
so
innocent
of
all
reproach
save
one
the
shame
of
loving
me
spare
her
or
if
ye
will
not
spare
slay
her
at
once
now
now
with
swift
compassionate
sword
but
cast
her
not
alive
into
yon
hideous
serpent
den
not
alive
ah
no
no
ye
gods
have
pity
here
his
voice
broke
and
a
sudden
light
passed
over
his
agonized
countenance
gazing
steadfastly
at
the
girl
whose
beautiful
white
body
now
lay
motionless
on
the
cold
stone
with
a
cloud
of
fair
hair
falling
over
it
his
eyes
seemed
to
strain
themselves
out
of
their
sockets
in
the
intensity
of
his
eager
regard
when
all
at
once
he
gave
vent
to
a
wild
peal
of
delirious
laughter
and
dead
thanks
be
to
the
merciless
gods
for
this
one
gift
of
grace
at
the
last
dead
o
the
blessed
favor
and
freedom
of
death
sweetheart
they
can
torture
thee
no
no
more
ah
devils
that
ye
are
and
his
voice
grown
frantically
loud
pierced
the
gloomy
arches
with
terrible
resonance
as
he
saw
the
slaves
vainly
endeavoring
to
rouse
with
ferocious
blows
and
thrusts
new
life
in
the
fair
stiffening
corpse
before
this
time
ye
are
baffled
baffled
and
i
live
to
see
your
vanquishment
give
her
to
me
and
he
stretched
out
his
trembling
arms
give
her
she
is
dead
and
ye
can
not
offer
to
nagaya
any
lifeless
thing
i
will
weave
her
a
shroud
of
her
own
gold
hair
i
will
bury
her
softly
away
in
the
darkness
i
will
sing
to
her
as
i
used
to
sing
in
the
silent
summer
evenings
when
we
fancied
our
secret
of
forbidden
love
unknown
and
with
my
lips
on
hers
i
will
pray
for
the
pardon
of
passion
grown
stronger
than
life
he
ceased
and
swaying
forward
fell
a
shiver
ran
through
his
limbs
one
deep
gasping
sigh
and
all
was
over
the
band
of
torturers
gathered
round
the
body
uttering
fierce
oaths
and
exclamations
of
dismay
both
dead
said
one
of
the
individuals
in
is
a
most
fatal
augury
fatal
indeed
said
another
and
turning
to
the
men
with
the
blood
stained
axes
he
added
angrily
ye
were
too
swift
and
lavish
of
your
weapons
ye
should
have
let
these
criminals
suffer
slowly
inch
by
inch
and
yet
have
left
them
life
enough
wherewith
to
linger
on
in
anguish
many
hours
the
wretches
thus
addressed
looked
sullen
and
humiliated
and
approaching
the
two
corpses
would
have
brutally
inflicted
fresh
wounds
on
them
had
not
the
seeming
chief
of
the
party
interfered
let
let
be
he
said
austerely
ye
can
not
cause
the
dead
to
feel
would
that
it
were
possible
then
might
the
glorious
and
god
like
thirst
of
vengeance
in
our
great
high
priestess
be
somewhat
more
appeased
in
this
matter
for
the
unlawful
communion
of
love
between
a
vestal
virgin
and
an
anointed
priest
can
not
be
too
utterly
abhorred
and
condemned
and
these
twain
who
thus
did
foully
violate
their
vows
have
perished
far
too
easily
the
sanctity
of
the
temple
has
been
outraged
lysia
will
not
be
satisfied
and
how
shall
we
pacify
her
righteous
wrath
concerning
this
too
tranquil
death
of
the
undeserving
and
impure
drawing
all
together
in
a
close
group
they
held
a
whispered
consultation
and
finally
appearing
to
have
come
to
some
sort
of
decision
they
took
up
the
dead
bodies
one
after
another
and
flung
them
carelessly
into
the
dark
aperture
lately
unclosed
as
they
did
this
a
stealthy
rustling
sound
was
heard
as
of
some
great
creature
moving
to
and
fro
in
the
far
interior
but
they
soon
locked
and
barred
the
iron
portal
once
more
and
then
took
their
departure
rather
hurriedly
leaving
the
vault
by
the
way
theos
had
entered
it
namely
up
the
stone
stairway
that
led
into
lysia
as
the
last
echo
of
their
retreating
steps
died
away
and
the
last
glimmer
of
their
lurid
torches
vanished
theos
sprang
out
from
his
his
venerable
companion
slowly
followed
oh
god
can
such
things
be
he
cried
loudly
reckless
of
all
possible
risk
for
himself
as
his
voice
rang
penetratingly
through
the
deep
silence
were
these
actual
men
or
but
the
wandering
grim
shadows
of
some
long
past
crime
nay
surely
i
do
but
dream
and
ghouls
and
demons
born
out
of
do
vex
my
troubled
spirit
justice
justice
for
the
innocent
is
there
none
in
all
none
replied
the
old
man
who
stood
beside
him
lamp
in
hand
fixing
his
dark
melancholy
eyes
upon
him
as
he
spoke
none
neither
in
nor
in
any
other
great
city
on
the
peopled
earth
justice
i
who
am
named
zuriel
the
mystic
because
of
my
tireless
searching
into
things
that
are
hidden
from
the
unstudious
and
unthinking
i
know
that
justice
is
an
idle
name
an
empty
forever
on
the
mouths
of
kings
and
judges
but
never
in
their
hearts
moreover
what
is
guilt
what
is
innocence
both
must
be
defined
according
to
the
law
of
the
realm
wherein
we
dwell
and
from
that
law
there
can
be
no
appeal
these
men
we
lately
saw
were
the
chief
priests
and
executioners
of
the
sacred
temple
they
have
done
no
wrong
they
have
simply
fulfilled
their
duty
the
culprits
slain
deserved
their
fate
they
loved
where
loving
was
forbidden
torture
and
death
was
the
strictly
ordained
punishment
and
herein
was
justice
justice
as
portioned
out
by
the
penal
code
of
the
high
court
of
council
theos
heard
and
gave
an
expressive
gesture
of
loathing
and
contempt
o
narrow
jurisdiction
o
false
equity
he
exclaimed
passionately
are
there
different
laws
for
high
and
low
must
the
weak
and
defenceless
be
condemned
to
death
for
the
sin
committed
openly
by
their
more
powerful
brethren
who
yet
escape
what
of
the
high
priestess
then
if
these
poor
merited
their
doom
why
is
not
lysia
slain
is
not
she
a
willingly
violated
vestal
doth
she
not
count
her
lovers
by
the
score
are
not
her
vows
long
since
broken
is
not
her
life
a
life
of
wanton
luxury
and
open
shame
why
doth
the
law
beholding
these
things
remain
in
her
case
dumb
and
ineffectual
hush
hush
my
son
said
the
aged
zuriel
anxiously
these
stone
walls
hear
thee
far
too
loudly
who
knows
but
they
may
echo
forth
thy
words
to
unsuspected
listeners
peace
peace
lysia
is
as
much
queen
as
zephoranim
is
king
of
and
surely
thou
knowest
that
the
sins
of
tyrants
are
accounted
virtues
so
long
as
they
retain
their
ruling
powers
the
public
voice
pronounces
lysia
chaste
and
zephoranim
faithful
who
then
shall
dare
to
disprove
the
verdict
is
the
same
in
all
countries
near
and
far
the
law
serves
the
strong
while
professing
to
defend
the
weak
the
rich
man
gains
his
cause
the
beggar
loses
it
how
can
it
be
otherwise
while
lust
of
gold
prevails
gold
is
the
of
this
our
era
without
it
kings
and
ministers
are
impotent
and
armies
starve
with
it
all
things
can
be
accomplished
even
to
the
concealment
of
the
foulest
crimes
come
come
and
he
laid
one
hand
kindly
on
theos
arm
thou
hast
a
generous
and
fiery
spirit
but
thou
shouldst
never
have
been
born
into
this
planet
if
thou
seekest
such
a
thing
as
justice
no
man
will
ever
deal
true
justice
to
his
fellow
man
on
earth
unless
perhaps
in
ages
to
come
when
the
old
creeds
are
swept
away
for
a
new
and
a
grander
wider
purer
form
of
faith
is
accepted
by
the
people
for
religion
in
is
a
hollow
mockery
a
sham
kept
up
partly
from
fear
partly
from
motives
of
policy
but
every
thinker
is
an
atheist
at
heart
our
splendid
civilization
is
tottering
towards
its
fall
and
should
the
destruction
of
this
city
come
to
pass
vast
ages
of
progress
discovery
and
invention
will
be
swept
away
as
though
they
had
never
been
he
paused
and
sighed
then
continued
sorrowfully
there
is
there
must
be
something
wrong
in
the
mechanism
of
life
some
little
hitch
that
stops
the
even
wheels
some
curious
perpetual
mischance
that
crosses
us
at
every
turn
but
i
doubt
not
all
is
for
the
best
and
will
prove
most
truly
so
hereafter
hereafter
echoes
theos
bitterly
thinkest
thou
that
even
god
repenting
of
the
evil
he
hath
done
will
ever
be
able
to
compensate
us
by
any
future
bliss
for
all
the
needless
anguish
of
the
present
zuriel
looked
at
him
with
a
strange
almost
spectral
expression
of
mingled
pity
fear
and
misgiving
but
he
offered
no
reply
to
this
of
a
question
in
grave
silence
and
with
slow
majestic
tread
he
began
to
lead
the
way
along
through
the
dismal
labyrinth
of
black
winding
arches
holding
his
blue
lamp
aloft
as
he
went
the
better
to
lighten
the
dense
gloom
theos
followed
him
silent
also
and
wrapped
in
stern
and
mournful
musings
of
his
own
musings
through
which
faint
threads
of
pale
recollection
connected
with
his
past
glimmered
hazily
from
time
to
time
perplexing
rather
than
enlightening
his
bewildered
brain
presently
he
found
himself
in
a
low
narrow
vestibule
illumined
by
the
bright
yet
soft
radiance
of
a
suspended
star
and
here
coming
close
up
with
his
guide
and
observing
his
dress
and
manner
more
attentively
he
suddenly
perceived
a
shining
something
which
the
old
man
wore
hanging
from
his
neck
and
which
flashed
against
the
sable
hue
of
his
garment
like
a
wandering
moonbeam
stopping
abruptly
he
examined
this
ornament
with
straining
wistful
gaze
and
slowly
very
slowly
recognized
its
fashion
of
construction
it
was
a
plain
silver
cross
nothing
more
yet
at
sight
of
the
sacred
strange
yet
familiar
symbol
a
chord
seemed
to
snap
in
his
brain
tears
rushed
to
his
tired
eyes
and
with
a
sharp
cry
he
fell
on
his
knees
grasping
his
companion
robe
wildly
as
a
drowning
man
grasps
at
a
floating
spar
while
the
venerable
zuriel
startled
at
his
action
stared
down
upon
him
in
evident
amazement
and
terror
rescue
rescue
he
cried
o
thou
blessed
among
men
thou
dost
wear
the
sign
of
eternal
safety
the
sign
of
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
the
way
there
is
no
going
without
the
truth
there
is
no
knowing
without
the
life
there
is
no
living
now
do
i
know
thee
for
a
saint
in
for
thou
dost
openly
avow
thyself
a
follower
of
the
divine
faith
that
fools
despise
and
selfish
souls
repudiate
ah
i
do
beseech
thee
thou
good
and
holy
man
absolve
me
of
my
sin
of
unbelief
teach
me
help
me
and
i
will
hear
thy
counsels
with
the
meekness
of
a
listening
child
you
i
kneel
i
pray
i
even
i
am
humiliated
to
the
very
dust
of
shame
i
have
no
pride
i
seek
no
glory
i
do
entreat
even
as
i
once
rejected
the
blessing
of
the
cross
whereby
i
shall
regain
my
lost
love
my
despised
pardon
my
vanished
peace
and
with
pathetic
earnestness
he
raised
his
hands
toward
the
silver
emblem
and
touched
it
tenderly
reverently
then
as
though
unworthy
he
bent
his
head
low
and
waited
eagerly
for
a
name
a
name
that
he
himself
could
not
remember
a
name
suggested
by
the
cross
but
not
declared
if
that
name
were
once
spoken
in
the
form
of
a
benediction
he
felt
instinctively
that
he
would
straightway
be
released
from
the
mysterious
spell
of
misery
that
bound
his
intelligence
in
such
a
grievous
thrall
but
not
a
word
of
consolation
did
his
companion
utter
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
agitated
by
the
strangest
surprise
and
alarm
now
may
all
the
gods
in
heaven
defend
thee
thou
unhappy
desperate
distracted
soul
he
said
in
trembling
affrighted
accents
thou
dost
implore
the
blessing
of
a
faith
unknown
a
mystery
predicted
but
not
yet
fulfilled
a
creed
that
shall
not
be
declared
to
men
for
full
five
thousand
years
chapter
xxi
the
crimson
river
at
these
unexpected
words
theos
sprang
wildly
to
his
feet
an
awful
darkness
seemed
to
close
in
upon
him
and
a
chaotic
confusion
of
memories
began
to
whirl
and
drift
through
his
mind
like
flotsam
and
jetsam
tossed
upon
a
sea
the
aged
and
zuriel
stood
motionless
watching
him
with
something
of
timid
pity
and
mild
patience
five
thousand
years
he
muttered
hoarsely
pressing
his
hands
into
his
aching
brows
while
his
eyes
again
fixed
themselves
yearningly
on
the
five
thousand
years
before
before
what
he
caught
the
old
man
arm
and
in
spite
of
himself
a
laugh
wild
discordant
and
out
of
all
keeping
with
his
inward
emotions
broke
from
his
parched
lips
thou
doting
fool
he
cried
almost
furiously
why
dost
thou
mock
me
then
with
this
false
image
of
a
hope
unrealized
who
gave
thee
leave
to
add
more
fuel
to
my
flame
of
torment
what
means
this
symbol
to
thine
eyes
speak
what
admonition
does
it
hold
for
thee
what
promise
what
menace
what
warning
what
love
speak
o
shall
i
force
confession
from
thy
throat
or
must
i
die
unsatisfied
and
slain
by
speechless
longing
what
didst
thou
say
five
thousand
years
nay
by
the
gods
thou
liest
and
he
pointed
excitedly
to
the
sacred
emblem
i
tell
thee
that
holy
sign
is
as
familiar
to
my
suffering
soul
as
the
chiming
of
bells
at
sunset
as
well
known
to
my
sight
as
the
unfolding
of
flowers
in
the
fields
of
spring
what
shall
be
done
or
said
of
it
in
five
thousand
years
that
has
not
already
been
said
and
done
zuriel
regarded
him
more
compassionately
than
ever
with
a
penetrating
mournful
expression
in
his
serious
dark
eyes
alas
alas
my
son
thou
art
most
grievously
distraught
he
said
in
troubled
tones
thy
words
but
prove
the
dark
disorder
of
thy
wits
may
heaven
soon
heal
thee
of
thy
mental
wound
restrain
thy
wild
and
wandering
fancies
for
surely
thou
canst
not
be
familiar
as
thou
sayest
with
this
silver
symbol
seeing
that
it
is
but
the
talisman
footnote
the
cross
was
held
in
singular
veneration
in
the
temple
of
serapis
and
by
many
tribes
in
the
east
ages
before
the
coming
of
christ
or

elect
it
was
designed
some
twenty
years
ago
by
the
inspired
chief
of
our
order
khosrul
and
such
as
are
still
his
faithful
disciples
wear
it
as
a
record
and
constant
reminder
of
his
famous
prophecy
theos
heard
and
a
dull
apathy
stole
over
him
his
recent
excitement
died
out
under
a
chilling
weight
of
vague
yet
bitter
disappointment
and
this
prophecy
he
asked
what
is
its
nature
and
whom
doth
it
concern
nay
in
very
truth
it
is
a
strange
and
marvellous
thing
replied
zuriel
his
calm
voice
thrilling
with
a
mellow
touch
of
khosrul
is
said
has
heard
the
angels
whispering
in
heaven
and
his
attentive
ears
have
caught
the
echo
of
their
distant
speech
thus
spiritually
instructed
he
doth
powerfully
predict
salvation
for
the
human
race
and
doth
announce
that
in
five
thousand
years
or
more
a
god
shall
be
moved
by
wondrous
mercy
to
descend
from
heaven
and
take
the
form
of
man
wherein
unknown
despised
rejected
he
will
live
our
life
from
commencement
to
finish
teaching
praying
and
sanctifying
by
his
divine
presence
the
whole
earth
this
done
he
will
consent
to
suffer
a
most
cruel
death
and
the
manner
of
his
death
will
be
that
he
shall
hang
nailed
hands
and
feet
to
a
cross
as
though
he
were
a
common
criminal
his
holy
brows
shall
be
bound
about
with
thorns
and
after
hours
of
agony
he
innocent
of
every
sin
shall
perish
miserably
friendless
unpitied
and
alone
but
afterward
and
mark
you
this
is
the
chiefest
glory
of
all
he
will
rise
again
triumphant
from
the
grave
to
prove
his
and
to
convince
mankind
beyond
all
doubt
an
question
that
there
is
indeed
an
immortal
hereafter
an
actual
free
eternity
of
life
compared
with
which
this
our
transient
existence
is
a
mere
brief
of
pause
and
probation
and
then
for
evermore
his
sacred
name
shall
dominate
and
civilize
the
world
what
name
interrupted
theos
with
eager
abruptness
canst
thou
pronounce
it
zuriel
shook
his
head
not
i
my
son
he
answered
not
even
khosrul
can
penetrate
thus
far
the
name
of
him
who
is
to
come
is
hidden
deep
among
unfathomed
silences
it
should
suffice
thee
that
thou
knowest
now
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
prophecy
would
i
might
live
to
see
the
days
when
all
shall
be
fulfilled
but
alas
my
remaining
years
are
few
upon
the
earth
and
heaven
time
is
not
ours
he
sighed
and
resumed
his
slow
pacing
onwards
theos
walked
beside
him
as
a
man
may
walk
in
sleep
uncertainly
and
with
unseeing
eyes
his
heart
beating
loudly
and
a
sick
sense
of
suffocation
in
his
throat
what
did
it
all
mean
had
his
life
gone
back
in
some
strange
way
or
had
he
merely
dreamed
of
a
former
existence
different
to
this
one
he
remembered
now
what
had
told
him
respecting
new
theory
of
a
future
religion
a
theory
that
to
him
had
seemed
so
old
so
old
so
utterly
exhausted
and
worn
threadbare
in
what
a
cruel
problem
was
he
hopelessly
involved
what
a
useless
perplexed
confused
being
he
had
become
he
who
would
once
to
have
staked
his
life
on
the
unflinching
strength
and
capabilities
of
human
reason
after
a
pause
forgive
me
he
said
in
a
low
tone
and
speaking
with
some
forgive
me
and
have
patience
with
my
laggard
comprehension
i
am
perplexed
at
heart
and
slow
of
thought
wilt
thou
assure
me
faithfully
that
this
thou
speakest
of
is
not
yet
born
on
earth
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
wondering
smile
flickered
over
the
old
wrinkled
countenance
like
the
reflection
of
a
passing
on
a
faded
picture
my
son
my
son
he
murmured
with
compassionate
tolerance
have
i
not
told
thee
that
five
thousand
years
and
more
must
pass
away
ere
the
prediction
be
accomplished
i
marvel
that
so
plain
a
truth
should
thus
disquiet
thee
now
by
my
soul
thou
lookest
pallid
as
the
dead
come
let
us
hasten
on
more
rapidly
thy
fainting
spirits
will
revive
in
fresher
air
he
hurried
his
pace
as
he
spoke
and
glided
along
with
such
a
curious
stealthy
noiselessness
that
by
and
by
theos
began
dubiously
to
wonder
whether
after
all
he
were
a
real
personage
or
a
phantom
he
noticed
that
his
own
figure
seemed
to
possess
much
more
substantiality
and
distinctness
of
outline
than
that
of
this
mysterious
zuriel
whose
very
garments
resembled
floating
cloud
rather
than
actual
woven
fabric
was
his
companion
then
a
fitting
spectre
he
smiled
at
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
and
to
change
the
drift
of
his
own
foolish
fancies
he
asked
suddenly
concerning
this
wondrous
city
of
is
it
of
very
ancient
days
and
long
lineage
the
annals
of
its
recorded
history
reach
over
a
period
of
twelve
thousand
years
replied
zuriel
but
is
the
present
fashion
to
count
from
the
deification
of
nagaya
or
the
snake
and
according
to
this
we
are
now
in
the
nine
hundred
and
year
of
grace
and
knowledge
rather
say
dishonor
and
crime
for
a
crueler
more
bloodthirsty
creed
than
the
worship
of
nagaya
never
debased
a
people
who
shall
number
up
the
innocent
victims
that
have
been
sacrificed
in
the
great
temple
of
the
sacred
python
and
even
on
this
very
day
which
has
just
dawned
another
holocaust
is
to
be
offered
on
the
veiled
shrine
or
so
it
hath
been
publicly
proclaimed
throughout
the
city
and
the
crowd
will
flock
to
see
a
virgin
blood
spilt
on
the
accursed
altars
where
lysia
in
all
the
potency
of
triumphant
wickedness
presides
but
if
the
auguries
of
the
stars
prevail
be
for
the
last
time
here
he
paused
and
looked
fixedly
at
theos
thou
dost
return
straightway
to
is
it
not
so
theos
bent
his
head
in
assent
art
thou
true
friend
or
mere
flatterer
to
that
spoilt
child
of
fair
fame
and
fortune
friend
cried
theos
with
eager
enthusiasm
i
would
give
my
life
to
save
his
aye
verily
is
it
so
and
zuriel
melancholy
eyes
dwelt
upon
him
with
a
strange
and
sombre
wistfulness
then
as
thou
art
a
man
persuade
him
out
of
evil
into
good
rouse
him
to
noble
shame
and
nobler
penitence
for
all
those
faults
which
mar
his
and
deprive
it
of
immortal
worth
urge
him
to
depart
from
while
there
is
yet
time
ere
the
bolt
of
destruction
falls
and
mark
you
well
this
final
warning
bid
him
avoid
the
temple
and
beware
the
king
as
he
said
this
he
stopped
and
extinguished
the
lamp
he
carried
there
was
no
longer
any
need
of
it
for
a
broad
patch
of
gray
light
fell
through
an
aperture
in
the
wall
showing
a
few
rough
broken
steps
that
led
upwards
and
pointing
to
these
he
bade
the
bewildered
theos
a
kindly
farewell
thou
wilt
find
palace
easily
he
said
not
a
child
in
the
streets
but
knows
the
way
thither
guard
thy
friend
and
be
thyself
also
on
guard
against
coming
disaster
and
if
thou
art
not
yet
resolved
to
die
escape
from
the
city
ere
soothe
thy
distempered
fancies
with
thoughts
of
god
and
cease
not
to
pray
for
thy
soul
salvation
peace
be
with
thee
he
raised
his
hands
with
an
expressive
gesture
of
benediction
and
turning
round
abruptly
disappeared
where
had
he
gone
how
had
he
vanished
it
was
impossible
to
tell
he
seemed
to
have
melted
away
like
a
mist
into
utter
nothingness
profoundly
perplexed
theos
ascended
the
steps
before
him
his
mind
anxiously
revolving
all
the
strange
adventures
of
the
night
while
a
dim
sense
of
some
unspeakable
coming
calamity
brooded
darkly
upon
him
the
solemn
admonitions
he
had
just
heard
affected
him
deeply
for
the
reason
that
they
appeared
to
apply
so
specially
to
and
the
idea
that
any
evil
fate
was
in
store
for
the
bright
beautiful
creature
whom
he
had
oddly
enough
learned
to
love
more
than
himself
moved
him
to
an
almost
womanish
apprehension
in
case
of
pressing
necessity
could
he
exercise
any
authority
over
the
capricious
movements
of
the
wilful
laureate
whose
egotism
was
so
absolute
whose
imperious
ways
were
so
charming
whose
commands
were
never
questioned
he
doubted
it
for
was
accustomed
to
follow
the
lead
of
his
own
immediate
pleasure
in
reckless
scorn
of
consequences
and
it
was
not
likely
he
would
listen
to
the
persuasions
or
exhortations
however
friendly
of
any
one
presuming
to
run
counter
to
his
wishes
again
and
again
theos
asked
himself
if
of
his
own
accord
and
despite
all
warning
deliberately
rushed
into
deadly
peril
could
i
even
loving
him
as
i
do
rescue
him
and
as
he
pondered
on
this
a
strange
answer
shaped
itself
unbidden
in
his
brain
an
answer
that
seemed
as
though
it
were
spoken
aloud
by
some
interior
no
no
ten
thousand
times
no
you
could
not
save
him
any
more
than
you
could
save
yourself
from
the
results
of
your
own
misdoing
if
you
voluntarily
choose
evil
not
all
the
forces
in
the
world
can
lift
you
into
good
if
you
voluntarily
choose
danger
not
all
the
gods
can
bring
you
into
safety
free
will
is
the
divine
condition
attached
to
human
life
and
each
man
by
thought
word
and
deed
determines
his
own
fate
and
decides
his
own
future
he
sighed
despondingly
a
curious
vague
contrition
stirred
within
him
he
felt
as
though
he
were
in
some
mysterious
way
to
blame
for
all
his
in
a
few
minutes
he
found
himself
on
the
broad
marble
embankment
close
to
the
very
spot
from
whence
he
had
first
beheld
the
beautiful
high
priestess
sailing
slowly
by
in
all
her
golden
pomp
and
splendor
and
as
he
thought
of
her
now
a
shudder
half
of
aversion
half
of
desire
quivered
through
him
flushing
his
brows
with
the
warm
uprising
blood
that
yet
burned
rebelliously
at
the
remembrance
of
her
witching
perfect
loveliness
here
too
he
had
met
ah
heaven
how
many
things
had
happened
since
then
how
much
he
had
seen
and
heard
enough
at
any
rate
to
convince
him
that
the
men
and
women
of
were
more
or
less
the
same
as
those
of
other
great
cities
he
seemed
to
have
known
in
days
that
they
plotted
against
each
other
deceived
each
other
accused
each
other
falsely
murdered
each
other
and
were
fools
traitors
and
egotists
generally
after
the
customary
fashion
of
human
pigmies
that
they
set
up
a
sham
to
serve
as
religion
gold
being
their
only
god
that
the
rich
wantoned
in
splendid
luxury
and
wilfully
neglected
the
poor
that
the
king
was
a
showy
profligate
ruled
by
a
treacherous
courtesan
just
like
many
other
famous
kings
and
princes
who
because
of
their
stalwart
martial
bearing
and
a
certain
surface
manage
to
conceal
their
vices
from
the
too
lenient
eyes
of
the
subjects
they
mislead
and
that
finally
all
things
were
evidently
tending
toward
some
great
convulsion
and
upheaval
possibly
arising
from
discontent
and
dissension
among
the
citizens
themselves
or
likelier
still
from
the
sudden
invasion
of
a
foreign
foe
for
any
more
terrific
termination
of
events
did
not
just
then
suggest
itself
to
his
imagination
absorbed
in
thought
he
walked
some
paces
along
the
embankment
before
he
perceived
that
a
number
of
people
were
already
assembled
there
men
women
and
children
who
crowding
eagerly
together
to
the
very
edge
of
the
parapet
appeared
to
be
anxiously
watching
the
waters
below
what
unusual
sight
attracted
them
and
why
were
they
all
so
silent
as
though
struck
dumb
by
some
unutterable
dismay
one
or
two
raising
their
heads
turned
their
pale
alarmed
faces
toward
theos
as
he
approached
their
eyes
seeming
to
mutely
inquire
his
opinion
concerning
the
alarming
phenomenon
which
held
them
thus
spellbound
and
he
made
his
way
quickly
to
where
they
stood
and
looking
where
they
looked
uttered
a
sharp
involuntary
exclamation
the
river
the
clear
rippling
river
was
red
as
blood
beneath
the
slowly
breaking
light
of
dawn
that
streaked
the
heavens
with
delicate
lines
of
and
daffodil
the
whole
visible
length
and
breadth
of
the
heaving
waters
shone
with
a
darkly
flickering
crimson
hue
deeper
than
the
lustre
of
the
deepest
ruby
flowing
sluggishly
the
while
as
though
clogged
with
some
thick
and
weedy
slime
as
the
sky
brightened
gradually
into
a
pale
ethereal
blue
so
the
tide
became
ruddier
and
more
pronounced
in
color
and
presently
as
though
seized
by
a
resistless
panic
the
group
of
staring
terrified
bystanders
broke
up
suddenly
and
rushed
away
in
various
directions
covering
their
faces
as
they
fled
and
uttering
loud
cries
of
lamentation
and
despair
theos
alone
remained
behind
resting
his
folded
arms
on
the
sculptured
balustrade
he
gazed
down
down
into
those
crimson
depths
till
their
strange
tint
dazzled
and
confused
his
sight
looking
up
for
relief
to
the
eastern
horizon
where
the
sun
was
just
bursting
out
in
full
splendor
from
a
pavilion
of
violet
cloud
the
red
reflection
was
still
before
his
eyes
so
much
so
that
the
very
air
seemed
flushed
with
spreading
fire
and
then
like
the
sound
of
a
tocsin
ringing
in
his
ears
the
words
of
the
prophet
khosrul
as
pronounced
in
the
presence
of
the
king
recurred
to
his
memory
with
new
and
suggestive
force
blood
blood
is
a
scarlet
sea
wherein
like
a
broken
and
empty
ship
founders
founders
never
to
rise
again
still
painfully
oppressed
by
an
increasing
sense
of
some
disaster
his
thoughts
once
more
reverted
anxiously
to
he
must
be
warned
yes
even
if
he
disdained
all
warning
yet
warn
him
against
what
bid
him
avoid
the
temple
and
beware
the
king
so
had
said
zuriel
the
mystic
but
to
the
laurelled
favorite
of
the
monarch
and
idol
of
the
people
such
an
admonition
would
seem
more
than
absurd
it
was
useless
to
talk
to
him
about
the
prophecies
of
khosrul
he
had
heard
them
all
and
laughed
them
to
scorn
how
can
i
then
mused
theos
disconsolately
how
can
i
make
him
believe
that
some
undeclared
evil
threatens
him
when
he
is
at
the
very
pinnacle
of
fame
and
fortune
with
all
at
his
feet
he
would
never
listen
to
me
nor
would
any
persuasions
of
mine
induce
him
to
leave
the
city
where
his
name
is
so
glorious
and
his
renown
so
firmly
established
of
lysia
treachery
i
may
perhaps
convince
him
yet
even
in
this
attempt
i
may
fail
and
incur
his
hatred
for
my
pains
if
i
had
only
myself
to
consider
and
here
his
reflections
suddenly
took
a
strange
unbidden
turn
if
he
had
only
himself
to
consider
well
what
then
was
it
not
just
within
the
bounds
of
probability
that
under
the
same
circumstances
he
might
be
precisely
as
and
as
haughtily
opinionated
as
the
friend
whose
arrogance
he
deplored
yet
could
not
alter
so
pointed
a
suggestion
was
not
exactly
suited
to
his
immediate
humor
and
he
felt
curiously
vexed
with
himself
for
indulging
in
such
a
foolish
association
of
ideas
the
positions
were
entirely
different
he
argued
angrily
addressing
the
troublesome
inward
monitor
that
every
now
and
then
tormented
him
there
was
no
resemblance
whatever
between
himself
the
unknown
unfamed
wanderer
in
a
strange
land
and
the
brilliant
chosen
poet
laureate
of
the
realm
no
resemblance
none
at
all
he
reiterated
over
and
over
again
in
his
own
mind
except
except
well
except
in
perhaps
a
few
trifling
touches
of
character
and
temper
that
were
scarcely
worth
the
noting
at
this
juncture
his
uncomfortable
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
a
harsh
metallic
voice
close
behind
him
what
fools
there
are
in
the
world
said
the
voice
in
emphatic
accents
of
supreme
contempt
what
braying
asses
what
swine
saw
you
not
yon
crowd
of
whimpering
idiots
flying
like
chaff
before
the
wind
weeping
wailing
and
bemoaning
their
miserable
little
sins
scattering
dust
on
their
addled
pates
and
howling
on
their
gods
for
mercy
all
forsooth
because
for
once
in
their
unobserving
lives
they
behold
the
river
red
instead
of
green
ay
me
is
a
thing
to
laugh
at
this
crass
and
brutish
ignorance
of
the
multitude
no
teaching
will
ever
cleanse
their
minds
from
the
cobwebs
of
vulgar
superstition
and
i
in
common
with
every
wise
and
worthy
sage
of
sound
repute
and
knowledge
must
needs
waste
all
my
scientific
labors
on
a
perpetually
ungrateful
public
turning
hastily
round
theos
confronted
the
speaker
a
tall
spare
man
with
a
pale
intellectual
face
small
shrewd
speculative
eyes
and
very
straight
neatly
parted
locks
a
man
on
whose
every
lineament
was
expressed
a
profound
belief
in
himself
and
an
equally
profound
scorn
for
the
opinions
of
any
one
who
might
possibly
presume
to
disagree
with
him
he
smiled
condescendingly
as
he
met
theos
look
and
saluted
him
with
a
gravely
pompous
air
which
however
was
not
without
a
saving
touch
of
that
indescribable
easy
grace
which
seemed
to
distinguish
the
manners
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
theos
returned
the
salutation
with
equal
gravity
whereupon
the
waving
his
hand
majestically
continued
you
sir
i
see
are
young
and
probably
you
are
enrolled
among
the
advanced
students
of
one
or
other
of
our
great
collegiate
institutions
therefore
the
peculiar
though
not
at
all
unnatural
tint
of
the
river
this
morning
is
of
course
no
mystery
to
you
if
as
i
presume
you
follow
the
scientific
classes
of
instruction
in
the
physiology
of
nature
of
manifestation
of
simple
and
complex
motive
force
and
the
perpetual
evolution
of
atoms
theos
smiled
the
grandiloquent
manner
of
this
individual
amused
him
most
worthy
sir
he
replied
you
form
too
favorable
an
opinion
of
my
scholarly
attainments
i
am
a
stranger
in
and
know
naught
of
its
educational
system
or
the
interior
mechanism
of
its
wondrous
civilization
i
come
from
lands
where
if
i
remember
rightly
much
is
taught
and
but
little
retained
where
petty
pedagogues
persist
in
dragging
new
generations
of
men
through
old
and
ruts
of
knowledge
that
future
ages
shall
never
have
need
of
and
concerning
even
the
progress
of
science
i
confess
to
a
certain
incredulity
seeing
that
to
my
mind
science
somewhat
resembles
a
straight
line
drawn
clear
across
country
but
leading
alas
to
an
ocean
wherein
all
landmarks
are
lost
and
swallowed
up
in
blankness
over
and
over
again
the
human
race
has
trodden
the
same
pathway
of
research
over
and
over
again
has
it
stood
bewildered
and
baffled
on
the
shores
of
the
same
vast
sea
the
most
marvellous
discoveries
are
after
all
mere
play
compared
to
the
tremendous
secrets
that
must
remain
forever
unrevealed
and
the
poor
and
trifling
comprehension
of
things
that
we
after
a
of
study
succeed
in
attaining
is
only
just
sufficient
to
add
to
our
already
burdened
existence
the
undesirable
clogs
of
discontent
and
disappointed
endeavor
we
die
in
almost
as
much
ignorance
as
we
were
born
and
when
we
come
face
to
face
with
the
last
dark
mystery
what
shall
our
little
wisdom
profit
us
with
his
arms
folded
in
an
attitude
of
enforced
patience
and
complacent
superiority
the
other
listened
curious
curious
he
murmured
in
a
mild
a
pessimist
aye
aye
is
very
greatly
the
fashion
for
young
men
in
these
days
to
assume
the
manner
of
elderly
and
exhausted
cynics
who
have
tried
everything
and
approve
of
nothing
is
a
strange
craze
but
my
good
sir
let
us
keep
to
the
subject
at
present
under
discussion
like
all
unripe
philosophers
you
wander
from
the
point
i
did
not
ask
you
for
your
opinion
concerning
the
uselessness
or
the
efficiency
of
learning
i
merely
sought
to
discover
whether
you
like
the
silly
throng
that
lately
scattered
right
and
left
of
you
had
any
foolish
forebodings
respecting
the
transformed
color
of
this
river
a
color
which
however
seeming
peculiar
arises
as
all
good
scholars
know
from
causes
that
are
perfectly
simple
and
easily
explainable
theos
hesitated
his
eyes
wandered
involuntarily
to
the
flowing
tide
which
now
with
the
fully
risen
sun
seemed
more
than
ever
brilliant
and
lurid
in
its
sanguinary
hue
strange
things
have
been
said
of
late
concerning
he
answered
at
last
slowly
and
after
a
thoughtful
pause
things
that
though
wild
and
vague
are
not
without
certain
dark
presages
and
ominous
suggestions
this
crimson
flood
may
be
as
you
say
the
natural
effect
of
purely
natural
causes
yet
notwithstanding
this
it
seems
to
me
a
singular
phenomenon
nay
even
a
weird
and
almost
fatal
augury
his
companion
laughed
a
gentle
careless
laugh
of
amused
disdain
phenomenon
augury
he
exclaimed
shrugging
his
shoulders
lightly
these
words
my
young
friend
are
terms
that
nowadays
belong
exclusively
to
the
vocabulary
of
the
uneducated
masses
we
and
by
we
i
mean
scientists
and
men
of
the
highest
culture
have
long
ago
rejected
them
as
unmeaning
and
therefore
unnecessary
phenomenon
is
a
particularly
vile
expression
serving
merely
to
designate
anything
wonderful
and
uncommon
whereas
to
the
scientific
eye
there
is
nothing
left
in
the
world
that
ought
to
excite
so
vulgar
and
barbarous
an
emotion
as
wonder
nothing
so
apparently
rare
that
can
not
be
reduced
at
once
from
the
ignorant
exaggerations
of
enthusiasm
to
the
sensible
level
of
the
commonplace
the
of
nature
have
thanks
to
the
advancement
of
practical
education
entirely
ceased
to
affect
by
either
surprise
or
admiration
the
carefully
matured
mathematically
adjusted
and
technically
balanced
brain
of
the
finished
student
or
professor
of
organic
evolution
and
as
for
the
idea
of
or
portents
nothing
could
well
be
more
entirely
at
variance
with
our
present
system
of
progressive
learning
whereby
human
reason
is
trained
and
taught
to
pulverize
into
indistinguishable
atoms
all
supernatural
propositions
and
to
gradually
eradicate
from
the
mind
the
absurd
notion
of
a
deity
or
deities
whom
it
is
necessary
to
propitiate
in
order
to
live
well
much
time
is
of
course
required
to
elevate
the
multitude
above
all
desire
for
a
religion
but
the
seed
has
been
sown
and
the
harvest
will
be
reaped
and
a
glorious
era
is
fast
approaching
when
the
people
of
all
nations
shall
govern
themselves
and
rejoice
in
the
grand
and
light
of
universal
liberty
somewhat
heated
by
the
fervor
of
his
declamatory
utterance
he
passed
his
hand
among
his
straight
locks
whether
to
cool
his
forehead
or
to
show
off
the
numerous
jewelled
rings
on
his
fingers
it
was
difficult
to
say
and
continued
more
calmly
no
young
sir
the
color
of
this
river
a
color
which
i
willingly
admit
resembles
the
tint
of
flowing
human
blood
has
naught
to
do
with
foolish
omens
and
forecasts
of
evil
is
simply
caused
by
the
influx
of
some
foreign
alluvial
matter
probably
washed
down
by
storm
from
the
sides
of
the
distant
mountains
whence
these
waters
have
their
rising
see
you
not
how
the
tide
is
thick
and
heavy
with
an
unfloatable
cargo
of
red
sand
some
sudden
disturbance
of
the
soil
or
a
volcanic
movement
underneath
the
ocean
or
even
a
distant
earthquake
any
of
these
may
be
the
may
be
why
not
say
must
be
observed
theos
half
ironically
since
learning
makes
you
sure
his
companion
pressed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
delicately
together
as
though
blandly
deprecating
this
observation
nay
nay
none
of
us
however
wise
can
say
be
he
argued
suavely
it
is
not
strictly
speaking
possible
in
this
world
to
pronounce
an
incontestable
certainty
not
even
that
two
and
two
are
four
suggested
theos
smiling
not
even
that
replied
the
other
with
perfect
gravity
inasmuch
as
in
the
kingdom
of
hypharus
whose
borders
touch
ours
the
inhabitants
also
highly
civilized
do
count
their
quantities
by
a
totally
different
method
and
to
them
two
and
two
are
not
four
the
numbers
two
and
four
not
being
included
in
their
system
of
figures
thus
a
professor
from
the
colleges
of
hypharus
could
obstinately
deny
what
to
us
seems
the
plainest
fact
known
to
yet
were
i
to
argue
against
him
i
should
never
persuade
him
out
of
his
theory
nor
could
he
move
me
one
jot
from
mine
and
viewed
from
our
differing
standpoints
therefore
the
first
simple
multiplication
of
numbers
could
never
be
proved
correct
beyond
all
question
theos
glanced
at
him
in
wonder
the
man
must
be
mad
he
thought
since
surely
any
one
in
his
senses
could
see
that
two
objects
placed
with
other
two
must
necessarily
make
four
i
confess
you
surprise
me
greatly
sir
he
said
and
in
spite
of
himself
a
little
quiver
of
laughter
shook
his
what
i
asked
was
by
way
of
jest
and
i
never
thought
to
hear
so
simple
a
subject
treated
with
so
much
profound
and
almost
doubting
seriousness
see
and
he
picked
up
four
small
stones
from
the
roadway
count
these
one
by
one
how
many
have
you
surely
even
a
professor
from
hypharus
could
find
no
more
and
no
less
than
four
very
deliberately
and
with
unruffled
equanimity
the
other
took
the
pebbles
in
his
hand
turned
them
over
and
over
and
finally
placed
them
in
a
row
on
the
edge
of
the
balustrade
near
which
he
stood
there
seem
to
be
four
he
then
observed
placidly
but
i
would
not
swear
to
it
nor
to
anything
else
of
which
the
actuality
is
only
supported
by
the
testimony
of
my
own
eyes
and
sense
of
touch
good
heavens
man
cried
theos
in
amazement
but
a
moment
since
you
were
praising
the
excellence
of
reason
and
the
progressive
system
of
learning
that
was
to
educate
human
beings
into
a
contempt
for
the
supernatural
and
spiritual
and
yet
almost
in
the
same
breath
you
tell
me
you
can
not
rely
on
the
evidence
of
your
own
senses
was
there
ever
anything
more
utterly
incoherent
and
irrational
and
he
flung
the
pebbles
into
the
redly
flowing
river
with
a
gesture
of
irritation
and
impatience
the
scientist
if
scientist
he
could
be
called
gazed
at
him
abstractedly
and
stroked
his
chin
with
a
somewhat
dejected
air
presently
heaving
a
deep
sigh
he
said
alas
i
have
again
betrayed
myself
is
my
fatal
destiny
always
by
some
mischance
i
am
compelled
to
avow
what
most
i
desire
to
conceal
can
you
not
understand
sir
and
he
laid
his
hand
persuasively
on
theos
arm
that
a
theory
may
be
one
thing
and
own
private
opinion
another
my
theory
is
my
profession
i
live
by
it
suppose
i
resigned
it
well
then
i
should
also
have
to
resign
my
present
position
in
the
royal
institutional
college
my
house
my
servants
and
my
income
i
advance
the
interests
of
pure
human
reason
because
the
age
has
a
tendency
to
place
reason
as
the
first
and
highest
attribute
of
man
and
it
would
not
pay
me
to
pronounce
my
personal
preference
for
the
natural
and
vastly
superior
gift
of
intellectual
instinct
i
advise
my
scholars
to
become
atheists
because
i
perceive
they
have
a
positive
passion
for
atheism
and
it
is
not
my
business
nor
would
it
be
to
my
advantage
to
interfere
with
the
declared
predilections
of
my
wealthiest
patrons
concerning
my
own
ideas
on
these
matters
they
are
absolutely
nil
i
have
no
fixed
principles
because
and
his
brows
contracted
in
a
puzzled
line
it
is
entirely
out
of
my
ability
to
fix
anything
the
whole
world
of
manners
and
morals
is
in
a
state
of
perpetual
ferment
and
consequent
change
equally
restless
and
mutable
is
the
world
of
nature
for
at
any
moment
mountains
may
become
plains
and
plains
mountains
the
dry
land
may
be
converted
into
oceans
and
oceans
into
dry
land
and
so
on
forever
in
this
incessant
shifting
of
the
various
particles
that
make
up
the
universe
how
can
you
expect
a
man
to
hold
fast
to
so
unstable
a
thing
as
an
idea
and
respecting
the
testimony
offered
by
sight
and
sense
can
you
rely
upon
such
slippery
evidence
theos
moved
uneasily
a
slight
shiver
ran
through
his
veins
and
a
momentary
dizziness
seized
him
as
of
one
who
gazing
down
from
some
lofty
sees
naught
below
but
the
white
deceptive
blankness
of
a
mist
that
veils
the
deeper
deathful
chasms
from
his
eyes
could
he
rely
on
sight
and
sense
dared
he
take
oath
that
these
frail
guides
of
his
intelligence
could
never
be
deceived
doubtfully
he
mused
on
this
while
his
companion
continued
for
example
i
look
an
arm
length
into
space
my
eyes
assure
me
that
i
behold
nothing
save
empty
air
my
touch
corroborates
the
assertion
of
my
eyes
and
yet
science
proves
to
me
that
every
inch
of
that
arm
length
of
supposed
blank
space
is
filled
with
thousands
of
minute
living
organisms
that
no
human
vision
shall
ever
be
able
to
note
or
examine
wonder
not
therefore
that
i
decline
to
express
absolute
confidence
in
any
fact
however
seemingly
obvious
such
as
that
two
and
two
are
four
and
that
i
prefer
to
say
the
color
of
this
river
may
be
caused
by
an
or
a
rather
than
positively
assert
that
it
must
be
so
though
i
confess
that
as
far
as
my
knowledge
guides
me
i
incline
to
the
belief
that
be
is
in
this
instance
the
correct
term
he
sighed
again
and
rubbed
his
nose
perplexedly
theos
glanced
at
him
curiously
uncertain
whether
to
laugh
at
or
pity
him
then
the
upshot
of
all
your
learning
sir
he
said
is
that
one
can
never
be
quite
certain
of
anything
exactly
so
replied
the
pensive
sage
with
a
grave
shake
of
his
head
judged
by
the
very
finest
lines
of
metaphysical
argument
you
can
not
really
be
sure
whether
you
behold
in
me
a
person
or
a
phantasm
you
think
you
see
me
i
think
i
see
you
but
after
all
it
is
only
an
impression
mutually
shared
an
impression
which
like
many
another
less
distinct
may
be
entirely
erroneous
ah
my
dear
young
sir
education
is
advancing
at
a
very
rapid
rate
and
the
art
of
close
analysis
is
reaching
such
a
pitch
of
perfection
that
i
believe
we
shall
soon
be
able
logically
to
prove
not
only
that
we
do
not
actually
exist
but
moreover
that
we
never
have
existed
and
herein
as
i
consider
will
be
the
final
triumph
of
philosophy
a
poor
triumph
murmured
theos
wearily
what
in
such
a
case
would
become
of
all
the
nobler
sentiments
and
passions
of
man
love
hope
gratitude
duty
ambition
they
would
be
precisely
the
same
as
before
rejoined
the
other
complacently
only
we
should
have
learned
to
accept
them
merely
as
the
means
whereby
to
sustain
the
impression
that
we
live
an
impression
which
would
always
be
agreeable
however
delusive
theos
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
possess
a
peculiarly
constituted
mind
sir
he
said
and
i
congratulate
you
on
the
skill
you
display
in
following
out
a
somewhat
puzzling
investigation
to
almost
its
last
of
a
conclusion
pardon
me
i
should
scarcely
think
the
discussion
of
such
debatable
theories
conducive
to
happiness
happiness
and
the
scientist
smiled
scornfully
is
a
term
and
designates
a
state
of
being
that
can
only
pertain
to
foolishness
show
me
a
perfectly
happy
man
and
i
will
show
you
an
ignorant
witling
hardhearted
and
of
a
most
powerfully
good
digestion
many
such
there
be
now
wantoning
among
us
and
the
head
and
chief
of
them
all
is
perhaps
the
most
popular
numskull
in
the
poet
bah
let
us
say
the
braying
in
office
the
laurelled
theos
gave
an
indignant
start
the
hot
color
flushed
his
brows
then
he
restrained
himself
by
an
effort
control
the
fashion
of
your
speech
i
pray
you
sir
he
said
with
excessive
haughtiness
the
noble
laureate
is
my
friend
and
host
i
suffer
no
man
to
use
his
name
unworthily
in
my
presence
the
sage
drew
back
and
spread
out
his
hands
in
a
pacifying
manner
i
crave
your
pardon
good
stranger
he
murmured
with
a
kind
of
apologetic
satire
in
his
acrid
voice
i
crave
it
most
abjectly
yet
to
somewhat
excuse
the
hastiness
of
my
words
i
would
explain
that
a
contempt
for
poets
and
poetry
is
now
universal
among
persons
of
profound
enlightenment
and
practical
knowledge
i
am
aware
of
it
interrupted
theos
swiftly
and
with
passion
i
am
aware
that
men
rooted
in
narrow
prejudice
with
a
smattering
of
even
narrower
logic
presume
out
of
their
immeasurable
littleness
to
decry
and
make
mock
of
the
truly
great
who
thanks
to

unpurchasable
gift
of
inspiration
can
do
without
the
study
of
books
or
the
teaching
of
pedants
who
flare
through
the
world
and
full
of
song
like
angels
passing
heavenward
and
whose
voices
rich
with
music
not
only
sanctify
the
ages
but

still
to

contempt
for
poets
aye
is
common
the
petty
boastful
pedagogues
of
surface
learning
ever
look
askance
on
these
kings
in
exile
these
emperors
masked
these
gods
disguised
but
humiliated
condemned
or
rejected
they
are
still
the
supreme
rulers
of
the
human
heart
and
a
chanted
in
the
by
one
such
minstrel
outlasts
the
history
of
many
kingdoms
he
spoke
with
rapid
almost
unconscious
fervor
and
as
he
ended
raised
one
hand
with
an
enthusiastic
gesture
toward
the
now
brilliant
sapphire
sky
and
glowing
sun
the
scientist
looked
at
him
furtively
and
smiled
a
bland
expostulatory
smile
oh
you
are
young
you
must
be
very
young
he
said
in
a
little
time
you
will
grow
out
of
all
this
fanaticism
for
an
art
the
pursuance
of
which
is
really
only
wasted
labor
think
of
the
absurdity
of
it
what
can
be
more
foolish
than
the
writing
of
verse
to
express
or
to
encourage
emotion
in
the
human
subject
when
the
great
aim
of
education
at
the
present
day
is
to
carefully
eradicate
emotion
by
degrees
till
we
succeed
in
completely
suppressing
it
an
outburst
of
feeling
is
always
vulgar
the
highest
culture
consists
in
being
impassively
equable
of
temperament
and
absolutely
indifferent
to
the
attacks
of
either
joy
or
sorrow
i
should
be
inclined
to
ask
you
to
consider
this
matter
more
seriously
and
from
the
strictly
point
of
view
did
i
not
know
that
for
you
to
undertake
a
course
of
useful
meditation
while
you
remain
is
companionship
would
be
impossible
quite
impossible
nevertheless
our
discourse
has
been
so
far
interesting
that
i
shall
be
happy
to
meet
you
again
and
give
you
an
opportunity
for
further
converse
should
you
desire
it
ask
for
the
head
professor
of
scientific
positivism
any
day
in
the
strangers
court
of
the
royal
institutional
college
and
i
will
at
once
receive
you
my
name
is
professor
mira
khabur
at
your
service
and
laying
one
hand
on
his
breast
he
bowed
profoundly
a
professor
of
positivism
who
is
himself
never
positive
observed
theos
with
a
slight
smile
ah
pardon
returned
the
other
gravely
on
the
contrary
i
am
always
positive
of
the
unpositiveness
of
positivism
and
with
this
final
vindication
of
his
theories
he
made
another
stately
obeisance
and
went
his
way
theos
looked
after
his
tall
retreating
figure
half
in
sadness
half
in
scorn
this
proudly
incompetent
was
no
uncommon
character
surely
there
were
many
like
him
somewhere
in
the
world
somewhere
in
far
lands
of
which
the
memory
was
now
as
indistinct
as
the
outline
of
receding
shores
blurred
by
a
falling
mist
theos
seemed
painfully
to
call
to
mind
certain
casuists
he
had
known
who
had
attempted
to
explain
away
the
mysteries
of
life
and
death
by
rule
and
line
calculations
and
who
for
no
other
reason
than
their
mathematically
argued
denial
of
existence
had
gained
for
themselves
a
temporary
spurious
celebrity
yes
surely
he
had
met
such
men
but
where
realizing
with
a
sort
of
shock
that
he
was
quite
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
with
regard
to
any
real
cognizance
of
his
former
place
of
abode
and
the
manner
of
life
he
must
have
led
before
he
entered
this
bewildering
city
of
he
roused
himself
abruptly
and
resolutely
banishing
the
heavy
thoughts
that
threatened
to
oppress
his
soul
he
began
without
further
delay
to
direct
his
steps
towards
palace
he
glanced
once
more
at
the
river
before
leaving
the
embankment
it
was
still
blood
red
and
every
now
and
then
between
the
sluggish
ripples
multitudes
of
dead
fish
could
be
seen
drifting
along
in
shoals
and
tangled
in
nets
of
slimy
weed
that
at
a
little
distance
looked
like
the
floating
tresses
of
drowned
women
it
was
an
uncanny
sight
and
though
it
might
certainly
be
as
the
wise
mira
khabur
had
stated
the
purely
natural
effect
of
purely
natural
causes
still
those
natural
causes
were
not
as
yet
explained
satisfactorily
an
earthquake
or
would
perhaps
account
sufficiently
for
everything
but
then
an
inquiring
mind
would
desire
to
know
where
the
earthquake
or
occurred
and
also
why
these
supposed
disturbances
should
thus
curiously
affect
the
river
surrounding
answers
to
such
questions
as
these
were
not
forthcoming
either
from
professor
or
any
other
sagacious
pundit
and
theos
was
therefore
still
most
illogically
and
unscientifically
puzzled
as
well
as
superstitiously
uneasy
turning
up
a
side
street
he
quickened
his
pace
in
order
to
overtake
a
young
vendor
of
wines
whom
he
perceived
sauntering
along
in
front
of
him
balancing
a
flat
tray
loaded
with
thin
crystal
flasks
on
his
head
how
gloriously
the
sunshine
quivered
through
those
delicately
tinted
glass
bottles
lighting
up
the
glittering
liquid
contained
within
them
why
they
look
more
like
than
anything
else
and
the
boy
who
carried
them
moved
with
such
a
lazy
noiseless
grace
that
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
rather
than
a
human
being
hola
my
lad
called
theos
running
after
tell
me
is
this
the
way
to
the
palace
of
the
king
laureate
the
youth
looked
up
what
a
beautiful
creature
he
was
with
his
brilliant
dark
eyes
and
dusky
warm
complexion
why
ask
for
the
king
laureate
he
demanded
with
a
pretty
scorn
the
people
lives
yonder
and
he
pointed
to
a
mass
of
towering
palms
from
whose
close
and
graceful
frondage
a
white
dome
rose
glistening
in
the
clear
air
our
poet
fame
is
not
the
outgrowth
of
a
mere
king
favor
is
the
glad
and
willing
tribute
of
the
nation
love
and
praise
a
truce
to
monarchs
they
will
soon
be
at
a
discount
in
and
with
a
flashing
glance
of
defiance
and
a
saucy
smile
he
passed
on
easily
sauntering
as
before
a
budding
republican
though
theos
amusedly
as
he
pursued
his
course
in
the
direction
indicated
that
is
how
the
equality
fraternity
system
always
begins
first
among
who
think
they
ought
to
be
gentlemen
then
among
shopkeepers
who
persuade
themselves
that
they
deserve
to
be
peers
then
comes
a
time
of
and
fierce
contention
and
by
and
by
everything
gets
shaken
together
again
in
the
form
of
a
republic
wherein
the
and
shopkeepers
are
not
a
whit
better
off
than
they
were
under
a
monarchy
they
become
neither
peers
nor
gentlemen
but
stay
exactly
in
their
original
places
with
the
disadvantage
of
finding
their
trade
decidedly
damaged
by
the
change
that
has
occurred
in
the
national
economy
strange
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
world
should
make
such
a
fuss
about
resisting
tyranny
and
oppression
when
each
particular
individual
man
by
custom
and
usage
tyrannizes
over
and
oppresses
his
to
an
extent
that
would
be
simply
impossible
to
the
fiercest
kings
thus
meditating
a
few
steps
more
brought
him
to
the
entrance
of
princely
abode
the
gates
stood
wide
open
and
a
pleasant
murmur
of
laughter
and
soft
singing
floated
toward
him
across
the
splendid
court
where
the
great
fountains
were
tossing
up
to
the
bright
sky
their
straight
glistening
columns
of
snowy
spray
he
listened
and
his
heart
leaped
with
an
intense
relief
and
joy
the
beloved
was
evidently
at
home
and
as
yet
unharmed
these
mirthful
sounds
betokened
that
all
was
well
the
vague
trouble
and
depression
that
had
weighed
upon
his
soul
for
hours
now
vanished
completely
and
hastening
along
he
sprang
lightly
up
the
marble
stairs
and
into
the
spacious
hall
where
the
first
person
he
saw
was
zabastes
the
critic
ah
good
zabastes
he
cried
gayly
where
is
thy
master
has
he
returned
in
safety
in
safety
croaked
zabastes
with
an
accent
of
ironic
to
be
sure
is
he
a
baby
in
that
he
can
not
be
trusted
out
alone
to
take
care
of
himself
in
safety
aye
i
warrant
you
he
is
safe
enough
and
silly
enough
and
lazy
enough
to
please
any
one
of
his
idiot
flatterers
moreover
my
and
he
emphasized
this
word
with
indescribable
bitterness
hath
slept
as
soundly
as
a
swine
and
hath
duly
bathed
with
the
punctiliousness
of
a
conceited
swan
and
being
suitably
combed
perfumed
attired
and
throned
as
becomes
his
dainty
puppetship
is
now
condescending
to
partake
of
vulgar
food
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
apartment
go
thither
and
you
shall
find
his
mightiness
nobly
enshrined
as
a
god
among
a
worshipping
crowd
of
witless
maidens
he
hath
inquired
for
you
many
times
which
is
somewhat
of
a
wonder
seeing
that
as
a
rule
he
concerns
his
mind
with
naught
save
himself
furthermore
he
is
graciously
pleased
to
be
in
a
manner
solicitous
on
behalf
of
the
maiden
niphrata
who
hath
suddenly
disappeared
from
the
household
leaving
no
message
to
explain
the
cause
of
her
evanishment
hath
seen
her
no
and
the
old
man
thumped
his
stick
petulantly
on
the
floor
as
theos
shook
his
head
in
the
negative
is
the
only
feminine
creature
i
ever
had
patience
to
speak
with
a
modest
wench
and
a
gentle
one
and
were
it
not
for
her
idolatrous
adoration
of
she
would
be
fairly
sensible
withal
no
matter
she
has
gone
everything
goes
even
good
women
and
nothing
lasts
save
folly
of
which
there
shall
surely
never
be
an
end
here
apparently
conscious
that
he
had
shown
more
feeling
in
speaking
of
niphrata
than
was
usual
with
him
he
looked
up
impatiently
and
waved
his
staff
toward
study
in
in
boy
in
to
the
chief
of
poets
and
prince
of
egotists
he
waits
your
service
he
is
all
agape
and
thirsty
for
more
flattery
and
delicate
cajolement
stuff
him
with
praise
good
youth
and
who
knows
but
a
portion
of
his
mantle
may
descend
on
you
hereafter
and
make
of
you
as
conceited
and
pretty
a
bantling
bard
for
the
glory
of
proud
posterity
and
chuckling
audibly
he
hobbled
down
a
side
passage
while
theos
half
angry
half
amused
crossed
the
hall
quickly
and
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
laureate
private
sanctum
where
gently
drawing
aside
the
silken
draperies
he
looked
in
for
a
moment
without
being
himself
perceived
what
a
picture
he
beheld
how
perfection
every
shade
of
color
in
every
line
of
detail
reclining
in
a
quaintly
carved
ebony
chair
was
toying
with
the
fruit
and
wine
set
out
before
him
on
an
ivory
and
gold
stand
his
dress
simpler
than
it
had
been
on
the
previous
evening
was
of
fine
white
linen
gathered
loosely
about
his
classic
figure
he
wore
neither
nor
jewels
the
expression
of
his
face
was
serious
even
noble
and
his
attitude
was
one
of
languid
grace
and
unstudied
ease
that
became
him
infinitely
well
the
maidens
of
his
household
waited
near
him
some
of
them
held
flowers
one
kneeling
at
a
small
lyre
seemed
just
about
to
strike
a
few
chords
when
silenced
her
by
a
light
gesture
peace
zoralin
he
said
i
can
not
listen
thou
hast
not
my
niphrata
tenderness
zoralin
a
beautiful
dark
girl
with
hair
as
black
as
night
and
eyes
that
looked
as
though
they
held
suppressed
yet
ever
burning
fire
let
her
hands
instantly
drop
from
the
instrument
and
sighing
shrank
back
a
little
in
abashed
silence
at
that
moment
theos
advanced
and
the
laureate
sprang
up
delightedly
ah
at
last
my
friend
he
cried
enthusiastically
clasping
him
by
both
hands
where
in
the
name
of
all
the
gods
hast
thou
been
roaming
how
did
we
part
by
my
soul
i
forget
but
no
matter
thou
art
here
once
more
and
as
i
live
we
will
not
separate
again
so
easily
my
noble
theos
and
he
threw
one
arm
affectionately
around
his
neck
i
have
missed
thee
more
than
i
can
tell
these
past
few
hours
thou
dost
seem
so
sympathetically
conjoined
with
me
that
verily
i
think
i
am
but
half
myself
in
thine
absence
come
sit
thee
down
and
break
thy
fast
i
almost
feared
thou
hadst
met
with
some
mischance
on
thy
way
hither
and
that
i
should
have
had
to
sally
forth
and
rescue
thee
again
even
as
i
did
yesternoon
say
hast
thou
occupied
thyself
with
so
much
friendly
consideration
on
my
behalf
as
i
have
on
thine
he
laughed
gayly
as
he
spoke
and
theos
looking
into
his
bright
beautiful
face
was
for
a
moment
too
deeply
moved
by
his
own
strange
inward
emotions
to
utter
a
word
in
reply
why
did
he
love
so
ardently
he
wondered
why
was
it
that
every
smile
on
that
proud
mouth
every
glance
of
those
flashing
eyes
possessed
such
singular
overwhelming
fascination
for
him
he
could
not
tell
but
he
readily
yielded
to
the
magic
influence
of
his
friend
extraordinary
attractiveness
and
sitting
down
beside
him
in
the
azure
light
and
soft
fragrance
of
his
regal
apartment
he
experienced
a
sudden
sense
of
rest
satisfaction
and
completeness
such
as
may
be
felt
by
a
man
at
one
with
himself
and
with
all
the
world
chapter
xxii
wasted
passion
the
assembled
maidens
had
retired
modestly
into
the
background
while
the
laureate
had
thus
joyously
greeted
his
returned
guest
but
now
at
a
signal
from
their
lord
they
again
advanced
and
taking
up
the
glittering
dishes
of
fruit
and
the
flasks
of
wine
proffered
them
in
turn
to
theos
with
much
deferential
grace
and
courtesy
he
was
by
no
means
slow
in
responding
to
the
humble
attentions
of
these
fair
ones
there
was
a
sort
of
deliciously
dreamy
enchantment
in
being
waited
upon
by
such
exquisitely
lovely
creatures
the
passing
touch
of
their
little
white
hands
that
supported
the
heavy
golden
salvers
seemed
to
add
new
savor
to
the
luscious
fare
the
timorous
fire
of
their
downcast
eyes
softly
sparkling
through
the
veil
of
their
long
lashes
gave
extra
warmth
to
the
ambrosial
wine
and
he
could
not
refrain
from
occasionally
whispering
a
tender
flattery
or
delicate
compliment
in
the
ear
of
one
or
other
of
his
servitors
though
they
all
appeared
curiously
unmoved
by
his
choicely
worded
adulation
now
and
then
a
pale
flickering
blush
or
sudden
smile
brightened
their
faces
but
for
the
most
part
they
maintained
a
demure
and
serious
demeanor
as
though
possessed
by
the
very
spirit
of
invincible
reserve
with
it
was
otherwise
they
hovered
about
him
like
butterflies
round
a
rose
a
thousand
wistful
passionate
glances
darted
upon
him
when
he
unconscious
or
indifferent
apparently
saw
nothing
many
a
deep
involuntary
sigh
was
stifled
quickly
ere
it
could
escape
between
the
rosy
lips
whose
duty
it
was
to
wreathe
themselves
with
smiles
and
theos
noticing
these
things
thought
heavens
how
this
man
is
loved
and
yet
he
out
of
all
men
is
perhaps
the
most
ignorant
of
love
true
meaning
scarcely
had
this
reflection
entered
his
mind
than
he
became
bitterly
angry
with
himself
for
having
indulged
in
it
how
recreant
how
base
an
idea
how
incompatible
with
the
adoring
homage
he
felt
for
his
friend
what
a
poet
whose
songs
of
love
were
so
perfect
so
wildly
sweet
and
he
to
be
ignorant
of
love
true
meaning
oh
impossible
and
a
burning
flush
of
shame
rose
to
theos
brow
shame
that
he
could
have
entertained
such
a
blasphemy
against
his
idol
for
a
moment
then
that
curious
vague
soft
contrition
he
had
before
experienced
stole
over
him
once
again
a
sudden
moisture
filled
his
eyes
and
turning
abruptly
toward
his
host
he
held
out
his
own
just
filled
goblet
drink
we
the
together
he
said
and
his
voice
trembled
a
little
with
its
own
deep
tenderness
pledge
me
thy
faith
as
i
do
pledge
thee
mine
and
for
at
least
let
me
enjoy
thy
boon
companionship
who
knows
how
soon
we
may
be
forced
to
part
forever
and
he
breathed
the
last
word
softly
with
a
faint
sigh
looked
at
him
with
an
expressive
glance
of
bright
surprise
part
he
exclaimed
joyously
nay
not
we
my
friend
not
till
we
find
each
other
tiresome
not
till
we
prove
that
our
spirits
like
steeds
do
chafe
and
fret
one
another
too
rudely
in
the
harness
of
custom
wherefore
then
and
then
only
be
time
to
break
loose
at
a
gallop
and
seek
each
one
a
wider
meanwhile
here
to
thee
and
bending
his
handsome
head
he
readily
drank
a
deep
draught
of
the
proffered
may
all
the
gods
hold
fast
our
bond
of
friendship
and
with
a
graceful
salute
he
returned
the
jewelled
cup
theos
at
once
drained
off
what
yet
remained
within
it
and
then
leaning
more
confidentially
over
the
laureate
chair
he
whispered
hast
thou
in
very
truth
forgotten
thy
rashness
of
last
night
surely
thou
must
guess
how
unquiet
i
have
been
concerning
thee
tell
me
was
thy
hot
pursuit
in
vain
didst
thou
discover
the
king
peace
and
a
quick
frown
darkened
the
smooth
beauty
of
face
as
he
grasped
theos
arm
hard
to
warn
him
into
silence
then
forcing
a
smile
he
answered
in
the
same
low
was
not
the
king
it
could
not
be
thou
wert
mistaken
nay
but
persisted
theos
gently
convince
me
of
mine
error
didst
thou
overtake
and
steadily
confront
yon
armed
and
muffled
stranger
not
i
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
petulantly
sleep
fell
upon
me
suddenly
when
i
left
thee
and
methinks
i
must
have
wandered
home
like
a
shadow
in
a
dream
was
i
not
drunk
last
night
aye
and
so
in
all
likelihood
wert
thou
little
could
we
be
trusted
to
recognize
either
king
or
clown
he
laughed
then
added
nevertheless
i
tell
thee
once
again
was
not
the
king
his
majesty
hath
too
much
at
stake
to
risk
so
dangerous
a
pleasantry
theos
heard
but
he
was
dissatisfied
and
ill
at
ease
careless
contentment
increased
his
own
disquietude
just
then
a
personage
entered
the
apartment
a
dwarfish
negro
who
carried
slung
across
his
back
a
large
bundle
consisting
of
several
neatly
pieces
of
linen
one
of
which
he
presently
detached
from
the
rest
and
set
down
before
the
laureate
who
in
return
gave
him
a
silver
coin
at
the
same
time
asking
jestingly
is
the
news
worth
paying
for
zibya
or
is
it
the
same
clumsy
chronicle
of
trumpery
events
zibya
slipping
the
coin
he
had
received
into
a
wide
leathern
pouch
which
hung
from
his
girdle
appeared
to
meditate
a
moment
then
he
replied
if
the
truth
must
be
told
most
illustrious
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
interest
the
minds
of
the
cultured
the
cheap
scribes
of
the
daily
circular
cater
chiefly
for
the
mob
and
do
all
in
their
power
to
foster
morbid
qualities
of
disposition
and
murderous
tendencies
among
the
lower
orders
hence
though
there
is
nothing
in
the
pertaining
to
literature
or
the
fine
arts
there
is
much
concerning
the
sudden
death
of
the
young
sculptor
whose
body
was
found
flung
on
the
banks
of
the
river
this
morning
theos
started
listened
with
placid
indifference
is
a
case
of
pursued
zibya
or
so
say
the
wise
writers
who
are
supposed
to
know
everything
committed
during
a
state
of
temporary
insanity
well
well
i
myself
would
have
had
a
different
opinion
and
a
sagacious
one
no
doubt
interrupted
coldly
and
with
a
dangerous
flash
as
of
steel
in
his
be
advised
good
zibya
give
thine
opinion
no
utterance
the
old
negro
shrank
back
nervously
making
numerous
apologetic
gestures
and
waited
in
abashed
silence
till
the
laureate
features
regained
their
wonted
soft
serenity
then
he
ventured
to
speak
again
though
not
without
a
little
hesitation
concerning
the
topics
of
the
hour
he
murmured
my
lord
is
perhaps
not
aware
that
the
river
itself
is
a
subject
of
much
excited
discussion
the
water
having
changed
to
a
marvellous
during
the
night
which
singular
circumstance
hath
caused
a
great
panic
among
the
populace
even
now
as
i
passed
by
the
embankment
the
crowd
there
was
thick
as
a
hive
of
swarming
bees
he
paused
but
made
no
remark
and
he
continued
more
glibly
also
contains
the
full
statement
of
the
reward
for
the
capture
of
the
prophet
khosrul
and
the
formal
programme
of
the
sacrificial
ceremonial
announced
to
take
place
this
evening
in
the
temple
of
nagaya
all
is
set
forth
in
the
fine
words
of
the
petty
public
scribes
who
needs
must
make
as
much
as
possible
out
of
little
and
there
is
likewise
a
facsimile
of
the
signature
which
will
naturally
be
of
supreme
interest
to
the
vulgar
furthermore
it
is
proclaimed
that
a
grand
combat
of
wild
beasts
in
the
royal
arena
will
follow
immediately
after
the
service
in
the
temple
is
concluded
methinks
none
will
go
to
bed
early
seeing
there
is
so
full
a
list
of
amusements
he
paused
again
somewhat
out
of
breath
and
meanwhile
unrolled
the
linen
scroll
he
had
purchased
which
measured
about
inches
in
length
and
twenty
in
width
carefully
ruled
black
and
red
lines
divided
it
into
nearly
the
same
number
of
columns
as
those
on
the
page
of
an
ordinary
newspaper
and
it
was
covered
with
close
writing
here
and
there
embellished
by
bold
profusely
ornamented
headings
one
of
these
death
of
the
sculptor
seemed
to
burn
into
theos
brain
like
letters
of
fire
how
was
it
he
wondered
that
the
body
of
that
unfortunate
victim
had
been
found
on
the
shore
of
the
river
when
he
himself
had
seen
it
loaded
with
iron
weights
and
cast
into
the
lake
that
formed
part
of
lysia
fatal
garden
presently
passed
the
scroll
to
him
with
a
smile
saying
lightly
there
my
friend
is
a
specimen
of
the
true
written
forgotten
is
a
droll
thing
to
meditate
upon
the
ephemeral
nature
of
all
this
of
unnecessary
words
and
stale
and
wouldst
thou
believe
it
theos
each
little
paid
scribe
that
adds
his
poor
quota
to
this
trash
deems
himself
wiser
and
greater
far
than
any
poet
or
philosopher
dead
or
living
why
in
this
very
i
have
seen
the
immortal
works
of
the
divine
hyspiros
so
hacked
by
the
blunt
knives
of
ignorant
and
vulgar
criticism
that
by
my
faith
were
it
not
for
contempt
one
would
be
disposed
to
nail
the
hands
of
such
trumpery
scribblers
to
a
post
and
scourge
their
bare
backs
with
thorny
rods
to
cure
them
of
their
insolence
nay
even
my
fool
zabastes
hath
found
place
in
these
narrow
columns
to
write
his
carping
diatribes
against
me
me
the
king
laureate
as
i
live
his
cumbersome
diction
hath
caused
me
infinite
mirth
and
i
have
laughed
at
his
crabbed
and
feeble
wit
till
my
sides
have
ached
most
potently
now
get
thee
gone
fellow
thou
and
thy
news
and
he
nodded
a
dismissal
to
the
deferential
zibya
who
with
his
woolly
gray
head
very
much
on
one
side
stood
listening
gravely
and
approvingly
to
all
that
was
said
yet
stay
has
gossip
whispered
thee
the
name
of
the
poor
virgin
for
this
evening
sacrifice
no
my
lord
responded
zibya
promptly
is
veiled
in
deeper
mystery
than
usual
i
have
inquired
of
many
but
in
vain
and
even
the
chief
flamen
of
the
outside
court
of
the
temple
always
drunk
and
garrulous
as
he
is
can
tell
me
naught
of
the
holy
victim
title
or
parentage
is
a
passing
fair
wench
said
he
with
a
is
all
i
know
concerning
her
a
passing
fair
wench
ah
and
zibya
rolled
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
and
sighed
in
a
comically
contemplative
if
ever
a
flamen
deserved
expulsion
from
his
office
it
is
surely
yon
ancient
crafty
soul
so
keen
a
glance
for
a
beauty
is
not
a
needful
qualification
for
a
servant
of
the
snake
divine
methinks
we
have
fallen
upon
evil
days
maybe
the
crazed
prophet
is
right
after
all
and
things
are
coming
to
an
end
like
thy
discourse
i
hope
zibya
observed
yawning
and
flinging
himself
lazily
back
on
his
velvet
couch
get
hence
and
serve
thy
customers
with
their
cheap
news
depend
upon
it
some
of
them
are
cursing
thee
mightily
for
thy
delay
and
if
thou
shouldst
chance
to
meet
the
of
my
household
niphrata
bid
her
make
haste
homeward
she
hath
been
absent
since
the
break
of
morn
too
long
for
my
contentment
maybe
i
did
unwisely
to
give
the
child
her
freedom
as
slave
she
would
not
have
presumed
to
gad
abroad
thus
wantonly
without
her
lord
permission
say
if
thou
seest
her
that
i
am
wrathful
the
thought
of
mine
anger
will
be
as
a
swift
wing
to
waft
her
hither
like
a
trembling
dove
afraid
all
penitent
and
eager
for
my
pardon
remember
be
sure
thou
tell
her
of
my
deep
displeasure
zibya
bowed
profoundly
his
outspread
hands
almost
touching
the
floor
in
the
servility
of
his
obeisance
and
backed
out
of
the
room
as
humbly
as
though
he
were
leaving
the
presence
of
royalty
when
he
had
gone
theos
looked
up
from
the
he
was
perusing
is
it
not
strange
niphrata
should
have
left
thee
thus
he
said
with
a
touch
of
anxiety
in
his
tone
maybe
and
he
hesitated
conscious
of
a
strange
unbidden
remorse
that
suddenly
and
without
any
apparent
reason
overwhelmed
his
maybe
she
was
not
happy
not
happy
ejaculated
amazedly
not
happy
with
me
not
happy
in
my
house
protected
by
my
patronage
where
then
if
not
here
could
she
find
happiness
and
his
beautiful
flashing
eyes
betokened
his
entire
and
naive
astonishment
at
the
mere
supposition
theos
smiled
how
charming
after
all
was
sublime
egotism
how
almost
was
his
confidence
in
himself
and
his
own
ability
to
engender
joy
all
at
once
the
young
girl
zoralin
spoke
her
accents
were
low
and
timorous
may
it
please
my
lord
to
hear
me
she
said
and
paused
thy
lord
hears
thee
with
pleasure
zoralin
replied
the
laureate
gently
thou
dost
speak
more
sweetly
than
many
a
bird
doth
sing
a
rich
warm
blush
crimsoned
the
maiden
cheeks
at
these
dulcet
words
she
drew
a
quick
uneasy
breath
and
then
went
on
i
love
niphrata
she
murmured
in
a
soft
tone
of
touching
tenderness
and
i
have
watched
her
often
when
she
deemed
herself
unseen
she
has
methinks
shed
many
tears
for
sake
of
some
deep
sorrow
we
have
lived
as
sisters
sharing
the
same
room
and
the
same
couch
of
sleep
but
alas
in
spite
of
all
my
lord
most
constant
kindly
favor
niphrata
is
not
happy
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
here
her
mellow
voice
sank
into
a
nervous
indistinctness
that
it
may
be
because
she
loves
my
lord
far
too
well
and
as
she
said
this
she
looked
up
with
a
sudden
affright
in
her
dark
lovely
eyes
as
though
she
were
alarmed
at
her
own
presumption
met
her
troubled
gaze
calmly
and
with
a
bright
smile
of
complacent
vanity
and
dost
thou
plead
for
thine
absent
friend
zoralin
he
asked
with
just
sufficient
satire
in
his
utterance
to
render
it
almost
am
i
to
blame
for
the
foolish
fancies
of
all
the
amorous
maidens
in
many
there
be
who
love
me
well
what
then
must
i
love
many
in
return
nay
not
so
the
poet
is
the
worshiper
of
ideal
beauty
and
for
him
the
brief
passions
of
mortal
men
and
women
serve
as
mere
pastime
to
while
away
an
hour
by
my
faith
thou
hast
gained
wondrous
boldness
in
thy
speech
to
prate
so
glibly
of
the
heart
emotion
what
knowest
thou
concerning
such
thou
who
hast
counted
scarcely
fifteen
summers
hast
thou
caught
contagion
from
niphrata
and
art
thou
too
sick
of
love
oh
the
dazzling
smile
with
which
he
accompanied
this
poignant
question
the
pitiless
burning
ardor
he
managed
to
convey
into
the
sleeping
brilliancy
of
his
soft
poetic
eyes
the
beautiful
languor
of
his
attitude
as
leaning
his
head
back
easily
on
one
arm
he
turned
upon
the
shrinking
girl
a
look
that
seemed
intended
to
pierce
into
the
very
inmost
recesses
of
her
soul
the
roseate
color
faded
from
her
cheeks
white
as
a
marble
image
she
stood
her
breath
coming
between
her
lips
in
quick
frightened
gasps
my
lord
she
stammered
i
here
her
voice
failed
her
and
suddenly
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
broke
into
a
passion
of
weeping
delicate
brows
darkened
into
a
close
frown
and
he
waved
his
hand
with
a
petulant
gesture
of
impatience
ye
gods
what
fools
are
women
he
said
wearily
ever
hovering
uncertainly
on
a
narrow
verge
between
silly
smiles
and
sillier
tears
as
i
live
they
are
most
uncomfortable
and
dwelling
with
them
long
would
drive
all
the
inspiration
out
of
man
no
matter
how
nobly
he
were
gifted
ye
butterflies
ye
little
fluttering
souls
and
beginning
to
laugh
as
readily
as
he
had
frowned
he
addressed
the
other
maidens
who
though
they
did
not
dare
to
move
or
speak
were
evidently
affected
by
the
grief
of
their
companion
go
hence
all
take
this
sensitive
baby
zoralin
into
your
charge
and
console
her
for
her
fancied
troubles
is
a
mere
frenzy
of
feminine
weakness
and
will
pass
like
an
april
shower
but
by
the
sacred
veil
if
i
saw
much
of
woman
weeping
i
would
discard
forever
woman
company
and
dwell
in
peaceful
hermit
fashion
alone
among
the
treetops
so
heed
the
warning
pretty
ones
let
me
witness
none
of
your
tears
if
ye
are
wise
or
else
say
farewell
to
and
seek
some
less
easy
and
less
pleasing
service
with
this
injunction
he
signed
to
them
all
to
depart
whereupon
the
awed
and
trembling
girls
noiselessly
surrounded
the
still
convulsively
sobbing
zoralin
and
gently
leading
her
away
they
quickly
withdrew
each
one
making
a
profound
obeisance
to
their
imperious
master
ere
leaving
his
presence
when
they
had
finally
disappeared
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
can
anything
equal
the
perverseness
of
these
frivolous
feminine
toys
he
murmured
pettishly
turning
his
head
round
toward
theos
as
he
spoke
was
ever
a
more
foolish
child
than
zoralin
just
as
i
would
fain
have
consoled
her
for
her
pricking
heartache
she
must
needs
pour
out
a
torrent
of
to
change
my
humor
and
quench
her
own
delight
is
the
most
irksome
inconsistency
theos
glanced
at
him
with
a
vague
emotion
of
wonder
and
sadness
nay
wouldst
thou
indeed
have
consoled
her
he
inquired
gravely
how
how
and
laughed
my
simple
friend
dost
thou
ask
me
such
a
babe
question
he
sprang
from
his
couch
and
standing
erect
pushed
his
clustering
dark
hair
off
his
wide
bold
brows
am
i
disfigured
aged
lame
or
can
not
these
arms
embrace
these
lips
engender
kisses
these
eyes
wax
amorous
and
shall
not
one
brief
hour
of
love
with
me
console
the
weariest
maid
that
ever
pined
for
passion
now
by
my
faith
how
solemn
is
thy
countenance
art
thou
an
anchorite
good
theos
and
wouldst
thou
have
me
scourge
my
flesh
and
groan
because
the
gods
have
given
me
youth
and
vigorous
manhood
he
drew
himself
up
with
an
inimitable
gesture
of
pride
his
attitude
was
statuesque
and
noble
and
theos
looked
at
him
as
he
would
have
looked
at
a
fine
picture
with
a
sense
of
critically
satisfied
admiration
most
assuredly
i
am
no
anchorite
he
said
smiling
slightly
yet
with
a
touch
of
sorrow
in
his
voice
but
methinks
the
consolement
thou
wouldst
offer
to
enamoured
maids
is
far
more
dangerous
than
lasting
thy
love
to
them
means
ruin
thy
embraces
shame
thy
unthinking
passion
death
what
wilt
thou
be
a
spendthrift
of
desire
wilt
thou
drain
the
fond
souls
of
women
as
a
bee
drains
the
sweetness
of
flowers
wilt
thou
being
behold
them
droop
and
wither
around
thee
and
wilt
thou
leave
them
utterly
destroyed
and
desolate
hast
thou
no
vestige
of
a
heart
my
friend
a
to
feel
the
misery
of
the
world
patient
grief
of
nature
commingled
with
the
dreadful
yet
majestic
silence
of
an
unknown
god
oh
surely
thou
hast
this
supremest
gift
of
genius
this
loving
enduring
faithful
sympathetic
heart
for
without
it
how
shall
thy
fame
be
held
long
in
remembrance
how
shall
thy
laurels
escape
decay
tell
me
and
leaning
forward
he
caught
his
friend
hand
in
his
thou
art
not
made
of
stone
thou
art
human
thou
art
not
exempt
from
mortal
suffering
not
exempt
no
interposed
thoughtfully
but
as
yet
i
have
never
really
suffered
never
really
suffered
theos
dropped
the
hand
he
held
and
an
invisible
barrier
seemed
to
rise
slowly
up
between
him
and
his
beautiful
companion
never
really
suffered
then
he
was
no
true
poet
after
all
if
he
was
ignorant
of
sorrow
if
he
could
not
spiritually
enter
into
the
pathos
of
speechless
griefs
and
unshed
tears
if
he
could
not
absorb
into
his
own
being
the
prayers
and
plaints
of
all
creation
and
utter
them
aloud
in
burning
and
immortal
language
his
calling
was
in
vain
his
election
futile
this
thought
smote
theos
with
the
strength
of
a
sudden
blow
he
sat
silent
and
weighed
with
a
dreary
feeling
of
disappointment
to
which
he
was
unable
to
give
any
fitting
expression
i
have
never
really
suffered
repeated
slowly
but
i
have
imagined
suffering
that
is
enough
for
me
the
passions
the
tortures
the
despairs
of
imagination
are
greater
far
than
the
seeming
real
petty
afflictions
with
which
human
beings
daily
perplex
themselves
indeed
i
have
often
here
his
eyes
grew
more
earnest
and
reflective
whether
this
busy
working
of
the
brain
called
may
not
perhaps
be
a
special
phase
or
supreme
effort
of
memory
and
that
therefore
we
do
not
imagine
so
much
as
we
remember
for
instance
if
we
have
ever
lived
before
our
present
recollection
may
in
certain
exalted
states
of
the
mind
serve
to
bring
back
the
of
things
long
gone
by
good
or
evil
deeds
scenes
of
love
and
strife
ethereal
and
divine
events
in
which
we
have
possibly
enacted
each
our
different
parts
as
unwittingly
as
we
enact
them
here
he
sighed
and
seemed
somewhat
troubled
but
presently
continued
in
a
lighter
yet
after
all
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
poet
to
personally
experience
the
emotions
whereof
he
writes
the
divine
hyspiros
depicts
murderers
cowards
and
slaves
in
his
sublime
tragedies
but
thinkest
thou
it
was
essential
for
him
to
become
a
murderer
coward
and
slave
himself
in
order
to
delineate
these
characters
and
i
i
write
of
love
love
spiritual
love
eternal
love
fitted
for
the
angels
i
have
dreamt
of
but
not
for
such
animals
as
men
and
what
matters
it
that
i
know
naught
of
such
love
unless
perchance
i
knew
it
years
ago
in
some
fairer
sphere
for
me
the
only
charm
of
worth
in
woman
is
beauty
beauty
to
its
entrancing
sway
my
senses
all
make
swift
surrender
oh
too
swift
and
too
degrading
a
surrender
interrupted
theos
suddenly
with
reproachful
vehemence
thy
words
do
madden
patience
better
a
thousand
times
that
thou
shouldst
perish
now
in
the
full
plenitude
of
thy
than
thus
confess
thyself
a
prey
to
thine
own
passions
a
credulous
victim
of
lysia
treachery
for
one
second
the
laureate
stood
amazed
the
next
he
sprang
upon
his
guest
and
grasping
him
fiercely
by
the
throat
treachery
he
muttered
with
white
treachery
darest
thou
speak
of
treachery
and
lysia
in
the
same
breath
o
thou
rash
fool
dost
thou
blaspheme
my
lady
name
and
yet
not
fear
to
die
and
his
lithe
brown
fingers
tightened
their
clutch
but
theos
cared
nothing
for
his
own
life
some
inward
excitation
of
feeling
kept
him
resolute
and
perfectly
controlled
kill
me
he
gasped
kill
me
friend
whom
i
love
death
will
be
easy
at
thy
hands
deprive
me
of
my
sad
existence
is
better
so
than
that
should
have
slain
thee
last
night
at
bidding
at
this
suddenly
released
his
hold
and
started
backward
with
a
sharp
cry
of
anguish
his
face
was
pale
and
his
beautiful
eyes
grew
strained
and
piteous
slain
me
me
at
lysia
bidding
he
murmured
o
ye
gods
the
world
grows
dark
is
the
sun
quenched
in
heaven
at
lysia
bidding
by
my
soul
my
sight
is
dimmed
i
see
naught
but
flaring
red
in
the
air
why
and
he
laughed
thou
poor
theos
thou
shalt
use
no
dagger
point
for
lo
i
am
dead
already
thy
words
have
killed
me
go
tell
her
how
well
her
cruel
mission
hath
sped
my
very
soul
is
slain
at
her
bidding
hasten
to
her
wilt
thou
and
his
accents
trembled
with
pathetic
plaintiveness
say
i
am
gone
lost
drawn
into
a
night
of
everlasting
blackness
like
a
taper
blown
swiftly
out
by
the
wind
tell
her
that
the
poet
the
who
loved
her
so
madly
is
no
more
his
voice
broke
his
head
drooped
while
theos
whose
every
nerve
throbbed
in
responsive
sympathy
with
the
passion
of
his
despair
strove
to
think
of
some
word
of
comfort
that
like
soothing
balm
might
temper
the
bitterness
of
his
chafed
and
wounded
spirit
but
could
find
none
for
it
was
a
case
in
which
the
truth
must
be
told
and
truth
is
always
hard
to
bear
if
it
destroys
or
attempts
to
destroy
any
one
of
our
cherished
my
friend
my
friend
he
said
presently
with
gentle
earnestness
control
this
fury
of
thy
heart
why
such
unmanly
sorrow
for
one
who
is
not
worthy
of
thee
looked
up
his
black
silky
lashes
were
wet
with
tears
not
worthy
oh
the
old
poor
consolation
he
exclaimed
quickly
dashing
the
drops
from
his
eyes
not
worthy
no
what
mortal
woman
is
ever
worthy
of
a
poet
love
not
one
in
all
the
world
nevertheless
worthy
or
unworthy
true
or
treacherous
naught
can
make
lysia
otherwise
than
fair
fair
beyond
all
fairness
and
i
i
was
sole
possessor
of
her
beauty
for
me
her
eyes
warmed
into
stars
of
fire
for
me
her
kisses
ripened
in
their
pearl
and
ruby
nest
all
all
for
me
and
now
he
flung
himself
desolately
on
his
couch
and
fixed
his
wistful
gaze
on
his
companion
grave
pained
countenance
till
all
at
once
a
hopeful
light
flashed
across
his
features
a
light
that
seemed
to
shine
through
him
like
an
inwardly
kindled
flame
ah
what
a
querulous
fool
am
i
he
cried
joyously
so
joyously
that
theos
knew
not
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
at
his
sudden
and
capricious
change
of
why
should
i
thus
bemoan
myself
for
fancied
wrong
good
noble
theos
thou
hast
been
misled
my
lysia
words
were
but
to
try
thy
mettle
to
test
thee
to
the
core
and
prove
thee
truly
faithful
as
friend
she
bade
thee
slay
me
even
so
but
hadst
thou
rashly
undertaken
such
a
deed
thine
own
life
would
have
paid
the
forfeit
now
i
begin
to
understand
it
all
is
plain
and
his
face
grew
brighter
and
brighter
as
he
cheated
himself
into
the
pleasing
idea
his
own
fancy
had
she
tried
thee
she
tempted
thee
she
found
thee
true
and
ah
was
a
jest
my
friend
and
entirely
recovering
from
his
depression
he
clapped
his
hand
heartily
on
theos
shoulder
was
all
a
jest
and
she
the
fair
inquisitor
will
herself
prove
it
so
ere
long
and
make
merry
with
our
fears
why
i
can
laugh
now
at
mine
own
despondency
come
look
thou
also
more
cheerily
gentle
theos
and
pardon
these
uncivil
fingers
that
so
nearly
gripped
thee
into
silence
and
he
laughed
thou
art
the
best
and
kindest
of
loyal
comrades
and
i
will
so
assure
lysia
of
thy
merit
that
she
shall
institute
no
more
upon
thy
frank
and
trusting
nature
heigho
and
stretching
out
his
arms
lazily
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
tranquil
satisfaction
methought
i
was
wounded
into
death
but
was
the
mere
fancied
prick
of
an
arrow
after
all
and
i
am
well
again
what
art
thou
still
melancholy
still
sombre
nay
surely
thou
wilt
not
be
a
veritable
theos
stood
mute
and
sorely
perplexed
he
saw
at
once
how
useless
it
was
now
to
try
and
convince
sah
luma
of
any
danger
threatening
him
through
the
instigation
of
the
woman
he
loved
he
would
never
believe
it
and
yet
something
must
be
done
to
put
him
on
his
guard
taking
up
the
scroll
of
the
public
news
where
the
account
of
the
finding
of
the
body
of
was
written
with
all
that
exaggerated
attention
to
repulsive
details
which
seems
to
be
a
special
gift
of
the
cheap
theos
pointed
to
it
his
was
a
cruel
end
he
said
in
a
low
uncertain
voice
canst
thou
expect
mercy
from
a
woman
who
has
once
been
so
merciless
bah
returned
the
laureate
lightly
who
and
what
was
a
hewer
of
stone
images
a
he
will
not
be
missed
besides
he
is
only
one
of
many
who
have
perished
thus
only
one
of
many
ejaculated
theos
with
a
shudder
of
and
yet
o
thou
most
reckless
and
misguided
soul
thou
dost
love
this
wanton
murderess
a
warm
flush
tinted
olive
skin
his
hands
clenched
and
unclenched
slowly
as
though
he
held
some
struggling
prisoned
thing
and
raising
his
head
he
looked
at
his
companion
full
and
steady
with
a
singularly
solemn
and
reproving
expression
in
his
luminous
eyes
hast
thou
not
loved
her
also
he
demanded
a
faint
serious
smile
curving
his
lips
as
he
spoke
if
only
for
the
space
of
some
few
passing
moments
was
not
thy
soul
ravished
thy
heart
enslaved
thy
manhood
conquered
by
her
spell
aye
thou
dost
shrink
at
that
and
his
smile
deepened
as
theos
suddenly
avoided
his
friend
blame
me
not
therefore
for
thine
own
weakness
he
then
went
on
slowly
with
a
meditative
i
love
her
yes
as
a
man
must
always
love
the
woman
that
baffles
him
the
woman
whose
moods
are
complex
and
fluctuating
as
the
winds
on
the
sea
and
whose
humor
sways
between
the
softness
of
the
dove
and
the
fierceness
of
the
tiger
nothing
is
more
fatally
fascinating
to
the
masculine
sense
than
such
a
creature
more
especially
if
to
this
temperament
is
united
rare
physical
grace
combined
with
keen
intellectual
power
is
vain
to
struggle
against
the
irresistible
witchery
exercised
over
us
by
the
commingling
of
beauty
and
ferocity
we
see
it
in
the
wild
animals
of
the
forest
and
the
birds
of
the
air
and
we
like
nothing
better
than
to
hunt
it
capture
it
tame
kill
it
as
suits
our
pleasure
he
paused
again
and
again
smiled
a
grave
reluctant
doubting
smile
such
as
seemed
to
theos
oddly
familiar
suggesting
to
his
bewildered
fancy
that
he
must
have
seen
it
before
on
his
own
face
reflected
in
a
mirror
even
thus
do
i
love
lysia
continued
she
perplexes
me
she
opposes
her
will
to
mine
the
very
irritation
and
ferment
into
which
i
am
thrown
by
her
presence
adds
fire
to
my
genius
and
but
for
the
spur
of
this
passion
who
knows
whether
i
should
sing
so
well
he
was
silent
for
a
little
space
then
he
resumed
in
a
more
ordinary
tone
the
wretched
whose
fate
thou
dost
so
persistently
deplore
deserved
his
end
for
his
presumption
didst
thou
not
hear
his
insolent
insinuation
concerning
the
king
i
heard
it
yes
replied
theos
and
i
saw
no
harm
in
the
manner
of
his
utterance
no
harm
exclaimed
excitedly
no
harm
nay
but
i
forget
thou
art
a
stranger
in
and
therefore
thou
art
ignorant
of
the
last
words
spoken
by
the
sacred
oracle
some
hundred
years
or
more
ago
they
are
these
the
high
priestess
is
the
king
mistress
then
fall
is
absolute
doggerel
and
senseless
withal
nevertheless
it
has
caused
the
enactment
of
a
law
which
is
to
the
effect
that
the
reigning
monarch
of
shall
never
under
any
sort
of
pretext
confer
with
the
high
priestess
of
the
temple
on
any
business
whatsoever
and
that
furthermore
he
shall
never
be
permitted
to
look
upon
her
face
except
at
times
of
public
service
and
state
ceremonials
now
dost
thou
not
at
once
perceive
how
vile
were
the
suggestions
of
and
also
how
foolish
was
thy
fancy
last
night
with
regard
to
the
armed
masquerader
thou
didst
see
in
lysia
garden
theos
made
no
reply
but
sat
absorbed
in
his
own
reflections
he
began
now
to
understand
much
that
had
before
seemed
doubtful
and
mysterious
no
wonder
he
thought
that
zephoranim
fury
against
the
audacious
khosrul
had
been
so
excessive
for
had
not
the
crazed
prophet
called
lysia
an
unvirgined
virgin
and
and
according
to
present
explanation
nothing
more
dire
and
offensive
in
the
way
of
open
blasphemy
could
be
uttered
yet
the
question
still
remained
was
khosrul
right
or
wrong
this
was
a
problem
which
theos
longed
to
investigate
and
yet
recoiled
from
instinctively
he
felt
that
upon
its
answer
hung
the
fate
of
and
also
what
just
then
seemed
more
precious
than
anything
else
the
life
of
he
could
not
decide
with
himself
why
this
was
so
he
simply
accepted
his
own
inward
assurance
that
so
it
was
presently
he
inquired
how
comes
it
that
the
corpse
of
was
found
on
the
shores
of
the
river
did
we
not
see
it
weighted
with
iron
and
laid
elsewhere
o
simpleton
laughed
thinkest
thou
lysia
lake
of
lilies
is
a
common
grave
for
criminals
the
body
of
sank
therein
true
but
was
there
no
of
lifting
it
from
thence
and
placing
it
where
best
such
carrion
should
be
found
hath
not
the
high
priestess
of
nagaya
slaves
enough
to
work
her
will
verily
thou
dost
trouble
thyself
overmuch
concerning
these
trivial
occurences
i
marvel
at
thee
hundreds
have
drained
the
silver
nectar
gladly
for
so
fair
a
woman
sake
hundreds
will
drain
it
gladly
still
for
the
mere
privilege
of
living
some
brief
days
in
the
presence
of
such
peerless
beauty
but
speaking
of
the
river
didst
thou
remark
it
on
thy
way
hither
aye
responded
theos
dreamily
was
red
as
blood
strange
and
looked
thoughtful
for
an
instant
then
rousing
himself
said
lightly
is
from
some
simple
cause
no
doubt
yet
create
a
silly
panic
in
the
city
and
all
the
fanatics
for
khosrul
new
creed
will
creep
forth
shouting
afresh
their
prognostications
of
death
and
doom
by
my
faith
be
a
most
desperate
howling
and
i
not
walk
abroad
till
the
terror
hath
abated
moreover
i
have
work
to
do
some
lately
budded
thoughts
of
mine
have
ripened
into
glorious
conclusion
and
zabastes
hath
orders
presently
to
attend
me
that
he
may
take
my
lines
down
from
mine
own
dictation
thou
shalt
hear
a
most
choice
legend
of
love
an
thou
wilt
listen
here
he
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
theos
shoulder
a
legend
set
about
methinks
with
wondrous
jewels
of
poetic
splendor
is
a
rare
privilege
i
offer
thee
my
friend
for
as
a
rule
zabastes
is
my
only
auditor
but
i
would
swear
thou
art
no
plagiarist
and
wouldst
not
dishonor
thine
own
intelligence
so
far
as
to
filch
pearls
of
fancy
from
another
minstrel
as
well
steal
my
garments
as
my
thoughts
for
verily
the
thoughts
are
the
garments
of
the
soul
and
the
common
thief
of
things
petty
and
material
is
no
whit
more
contemptible
than
he
who
robs
an
author
of
ideas
wherein
to
deck
the
bareness
of
his
own
poor
wit
come
place
thyself
at
ease
upon
this
cushioned
couch
and
give
me
thy
attention
i
feel
the
fervor
rising
within
me
i
will
summon
zabastes
here
he
pulled
a
small
silken
cord
which
at
once
set
a
clanging
bell
echoing
loudly
through
the
palace
and
thou
shalt
freely
hear
and
freely
judge
the
last
offspring
of
my
fertile
genius
my
lyrical
romance
theos
started
violently
he
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
restrain
the
anguished
cry
that
arose
to
his
lips
nourhalma
o
memory
reluctant
memory
why
why
was
his
brain
thus
tortured
with
these
conflicting
pang
of
piteous
recollection
little
by
little
like
sharp
deep
stabs
of
nervous
suffering
there
came
back
to
him
a
few
faint
fragmentary
suggestions
which
gradually
formed
themselves
into
a
distinct
and
comprehensive
certainty
nourhalma
was
the
title
of
his
own
poem
the
poem
he
had
written
surely
not
so
very
long
ago
among
the
mountains
of
the
pass
of
dariel
chapter
xxiii
nourhalma
his
first
emotion
on
making
this
new
mental
rediscovery
was
as
it
had
been
before
in
the
king
one
of
absolute
terror
feverish
mad
terror
which
for
a
few
moments
possessed
him
so
utterly
that
turning
away
he
buried
his
aching
head
among
the
cushion
where
he
reclined
in
order
to
hide
from
his
companion
eyes
any
outward
sign
that
might
betray
his
desperate
misery
clenching
his
hands
convulsively
he
silently
and
with
all
his
strength
combated
the
awful
horror
of
himself
that
grew
up
spectrally
within
him
the
dreadful
distracting
uncertainty
of
his
own
identity
that
again
confused
his
brain
and
paralyzed
his
reason
at
last
he
thought
wildly
at
last
he
knew
the
meaning
of
hell
the
frightful
spiritual
torment
of
a
baffled
intelligence
set
adrift
among
the
wrecks
and
shadows
of
things
that
had
formerly
been
its
pride
and
glory
what
was
any
physical
suffering
compared
to
such
a
frenzy
of
nothing
less
than
nothing
this
was
the
everlasting
thirst
and
fire
spoken
of
so
vaguely
by
prophets
and
preachers
the
thirst
and
fire
of
the
soul
unquenchable
longing
to
unravel
the
dismal
tangle
of
its
own
bygone
deeds
the
striving
forever
in
vain
to
steadfastly
establish
the
wavering
mystery
of
its
own
existence
o
god
god
what
hast
thou
made
of
me
he
groaned
inwardly
as
he
endeavored
to
calm
the
tempest
of
his
unutterable
despair
who
am
i
who
was
i
in
that
far
past
which
like
the
pale
spirit
of
a
murdered
friend
haunts
me
so
indistinctly
yet
so
threateningly
surely
the
gift
of
poesy
was
mine
surely
i
too
could
weave
the
harmony
of
words
and
thoughts
into
a
sweet
and
fitting
music
how
comes
it
then
that
all
work
is
but
the
reflex
of
my
own
o
woeful
strange
and
bitter
enigma
when
shall
it
be
unraveled
was
the
name
of
what
i
deemed
my
masterpiece
o
silly
masterpiece
if
it
prove
thus
easy
of
imitation
yet
let
me
be
patient
titles
are
often
copied
unconsciously
by
different
authors
in
different
lands
and
it
may
chance
that
poem
is
after
all
his
own
not
mine
not
mine
as
were
the
ballads
and
the
he
chanted
to
the
king
last
night
o
destiny
inscrutable
pitiless
destiny
rescue
my
tortured
soul
from
chaos
declare
unto
me
who
who
is
the
plagiarist
and
thief
of
myself
or
the
more
he
perplexed
his
mind
with
such
questions
the
deeper
grew
the
darkness
of
the
inexplicable
dilemma
to
which
a
fresh
obscurity
was
now
added
in
his
suddenly
distinct
and
distressful
remembrance
of
the
pass
of
dariel
where
was
this
place
he
wondered
wearily
when
had
he
seen
it
whom
had
he
met
there
and
how
had
he
come
to
from
thence
no
answer
could
his
vexed
brain
shape
to
these
demands
he
recollected
the
pass
of
dariel
just
as
he
recollected
the
field
of
ardath
without
the
least
idea
as
to
what
connection
existed
between
them
and
his
own
personal
adventures
presently
controlling
himself
he
raised
his
head
and
ventured
to
look
up
stood
beside
him
his
fine
face
expressive
of
an
amiable
solicitude
was
the
sunshine
too
strong
my
friend
that
thou
didst
thus
bury
thine
eyes
in
thy
pillow
he
inquired
pardon
my
discourteous
lack
of
consideration
for
thy
comfort
i
love
the
sun
myself
so
well
that
methinks
i
could
meet
his
burning
rays
at
full
and
yet
take
pleasure
in
the
warmth
of
such
a
golden
smile
but
thou
perchance
art
unaccustomed
to
the
light
of
eastern
lands
wherefore
thy
brows
must
not
be
permitted
to
ache
on
uncared
for
see
i
have
lowered
the
awnings
they
give
a
pleasant
shade
and
in
very
truth
the
heat
is
greater
far
than
ordinary
one
would
think
the
gods
had
kindled
some
new
fire
in
heaven
and
as
he
spoke
he
took
up
a
long
fan
and
waved
it
to
and
fro
with
an
exquisitely
graceful
movement
of
wrist
and
arm
while
theos
gazing
at
him
in
mute
admiration
forgot
his
own
griefs
for
the
time
in
the
subtle
strange
and
absorbing
spell
exercised
upon
him
by
his
host
irresistible
influence
just
then
too
appeared
handsomer
than
ever
in
the
tints
of
radiance
that
flickered
through
the
lowered
silken
awnings
the
effect
of
the
room
thus
shadowed
was
as
of
a
soft
azure
mountain
mist
lit
sideways
by
the
sun
a
mist
through
which
the
symmetrical
figure
of
the
laureate
stood
forth
in
curiously
brilliant
outlines
as
though
every
curve
of
supple
shoulder
and
proud
throat
was
traced
with
a
pencil
of
pure
light
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
made
its
way
through
the
casements
the
gentle
dashing
noise
of
the
fountains
in
the
court
alone
disturbed
the
deep
warm
stillness
of
the
morning
or
the
occasional
sweeping
rustle
of
peacocks
plumes
as
these
stately
birds
strutted
majestically
up
and
down
up
and
down
on
the
marble
terrace
outside
soothed
by
the
luxurious
peace
of
his
surroundings
the
delirium
of
theos
bewildering
affliction
gradually
abated
his
mind
regained
to
a
certain
extent
its
equilibrium
and
falling
into
easy
converse
with
his
fascinating
companion
he
was
soon
himself
again
that
is
as
much
himself
as
his
peculiar
condition
permitted
him
to
be
yet
he
was
not
altogether
free
from
a
certain
eager
and
decidedly
painful
suspense
with
regard
to
the
nourhalma
problem
and
he
was
conscious
of
what
he
in
his
own
opinion
considered
an
absurd
and
unnecessary
degree
of
excitement
when
the
door
of
the
apartment
presently
opened
to
admit
zabastes
who
entered
carrying
several
sheets
of
papyrus
and
other
material
for
writing
the
old
critic
countenance
was
expressively
glum
and
ironical
he
however
was
compelled
like
all
the
other
paid
servants
of
the
household
to
make
a
low
and
respectful
obeisance
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
in
presence
an
act
of
homage
which
he
performed
awkwardly
and
with
evident
his
master
nodded
condescendingly
in
response
to
his
reluctant
salute
and
signed
to
him
to
take
his
place
at
a
richly
carved
adorned
with
the
climbing
figures
of
winged
cupids
exquisitely
wrought
in
ivory
he
obeyed
shuffling
thither
uneasily
and
sniffing
the
air
as
he
went
like
an
cur
scenting
a
foe
and
seating
himself
in
a
chair
he
arranged
his
garments
fussily
about
him
rolled
up
his
long
embroidered
sleeves
to
the
elbow
and
spread
his
writing
implements
all
over
the
desk
in
front
of
him
with
much
ostentation
then
rubbing
his
lean
hands
together
he
gave
a
stealthy
glance
of
covert
derision
round
at
and
theos
a
glance
which
theos
saw
and
in
his
heart
resented
but
which
absorbed
in
his
own
reflections
apparently
failed
to
notice
all
is
in
readiness
my
lord
he
announced
in
his
disagreeable
croaking
tones
here
are
the
clean
and
harmless
slips
of
waiting
to
be
soiled
and
spotted
with
my
lord
indelible
thoughts
here
also
are
the
innocent
quills
of
the
white
heron
as
yet
unstained
by
colored
whether
black
red
gold
silver
or
purple
mark
you
most
illustrious
bard
the
touching
helplessness
and
purity
of
these
meek
servants
of
a
scribbler
fancy
blank
papyrus
and
empty
quills
bethink
you
seriously
whether
it
were
not
better
to
leave
them
thus
unblemished
the
simple
products
of
unfaulty
nature
than
use
them
to
indite
the
wondrous
things
of
my
lord
imagination
whereof
all
wondrous
though
they
seem
no
man
shall
ever
be
the
wiser
and
he
chuckled
stroking
his
stubbly
gray
beard
the
while
with
a
blandly
suggestive
yet
malign
look
directed
at
who
met
it
with
a
slight
cold
smile
of
faintly
amused
contempt
peace
fool
he
said
that
barbarous
tongue
of
thine
is
like
the
imperfect
clapper
of
a
broken
bell
that
strikes
forth
harsh
and
undesired
sounds
suggesting
nothing
thy
present
duty
is
to
hear
and
not
to
speak
therefore
listen
discerningly
and
write
with
exactitude
so
shall
thy
poor
blank
scrolls
of
reed
grow
rich
with
gems
gems
of
high
poesy
that
the
whole
world
shall
hoard
and
cherish
when
the
poet
who
created
their
bright
splendor
is
no
more
he
sighed
a
short
troubled
sigh
and
stood
for
a
moment
silent
in
an
attitude
of
pensive
thought
theos
watched
him
yearningly
waiting
in
almost
breathless
suspense
till
he
should
dictate
aloud
the
first
line
of
his
poem
zabastes
meanwhile
settled
himself
more
comfortably
in
his
chair
and
taking
up
one
of
the
long
quills
with
which
he
was
provided
dipped
it
in
a
liquid
which
at
once
stained
its
point
to
a
deep
roseate
hue
so
that
when
the
light
flickered
upon
it
from
time
to
time
it
appeared
as
though
it
were
tipped
with
fire
how
intense
the
heat
was
thought
theos
as
with
one
hand
he
pushed
his
clustering
hair
from
his
brow
not
without
noticing
that
his
action
was
imitated
almost
at
once
by
who
also
seemed
to
feel
the
oppressiveness
of
the
atmosphere
and
what
a
blaze
of
blue
pervaded
the
room
delicate
ethereal
blue
as
of
shimmering
lakes
and
summer
skies
melted
together
into
one
luminous
radiance
radiance
that
while
filmy
was
yet
perfectly
transparent
and
in
which
the
laureate
classic
form
appeared
to
be
gloriously
enveloped
like
that
of
some
new
descended
god
theos
rubbed
his
eyes
to
cure
them
of
their
dazzled
ache
what
a
marvellous
scene
it
was
to
look
upon
he
mused
would
he
could
he
ever
forget
it
ah
no
never
never
not
till
his
dying
day
would
he
be
able
to
obliterate
it
from
his
memory
and
who
could
tell
whether
even
after
death
he
might
not
still
recall
it
just
then
raised
his
hand
by
way
of
signal
to
zabastes
his
face
became
earnest
pathetic
even
grand
in
the
fervent
concentration
of
his
thoughts
he
was
about
to
begin
his
dictation
now
now
and
theos
leaned
forward
nervously
his
heart
beating
with
apprehensive
expectation
hush
the
delicious
suave
melody
of
his
voice
penetrated
the
silence
like
the
sweet
harmonic
of
a
write
said
he
write
first
the
title
of
my
poem
thus
a
of
the
past
there
was
a
pause
during
which
the
pen
of
zabastes
traveled
quickly
over
the
papyrus
for
a
moment
then
stopped
theos
almost
suffocated
with
anxiety
could
hardly
maintain
even
the
appearance
of
calmness
the
title
proclaimed
with
its
second
appendage
was
precisely
the
same
as
that
of
his
own
work
but
this
did
not
now
affect
him
so
much
what
he
waited
for
with
such
painfully
strained
attention
was
the
first
line
of
the
poem
if
it
was
his
line
he
knew
it
already
it
ran
thus
a
central
sorrow
dwells
in
perfect
joy
scarcely
had
he
repeated
this
to
himself
inwardly
than
with
majestic
grace
and
sweetness
of
utterance
dictated
aloud
a
central
sorrow
dwells
in
perfect
joy
ah
god
the
sharp
cry
half
fierce
half
despairing
broke
from
quivering
lips
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
he
made
to
control
his
agitation
and
the
laureate
turned
toward
him
with
a
surprised
and
somewhat
irritated
movement
that
plainly
evinced
annoyance
at
the
interruption
pardon
he
murmured
hastily
was
a
slight
pang
at
the
heart
troubled
me
a
mere
nothing
i
take
shame
to
myself
to
have
cried
out
for
such
a
pin
prick
speak
on
thy
first
line
is
as
soft
as
honey
dew
as
suggestive
as
the
light
of
dawn
on
sleeping
flowers
and
leaning
dizzily
back
on
his
couch
he
closed
his
eyes
to
shut
in
the
hot
and
bitter
tears
that
welled
up
rebelliously
and
threatened
to
fall
notwithstanding
his
endeavor
to
restrain
them
his
head
throbbed
and
burned
as
though
a
chaplet
of
fiery
thorns
encircled
it
instead
of
the
once
desired
crown
of
fame
he
had
so
fondly
dreamed
of
winning
fame
alas
that
bright
delusive
vision
had
fled
forever
there
were
no
left
growing
for
him
in
the
fields
of
poetic
art
and
aspiration
the
fortunate
had
gathered
and
possessed
them
all
taking
everything
into
serious
consideration
he
came
at
last
to
the
deeply
mortifying
conclusion
that
it
must
be
himself
who
was
the
plagiarist
the
unconscious
imitator
of
ideas
and
methods
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
his
imitation
was
so
terribly
exact
oh
how
heartily
he
despised
himself
for
his
poor
and
pitiful
lack
of
originality
down
to
the
very
depths
of
humiliation
he
sternly
abased
his
complaining
struggling
wounded
and
sorely
resentful
spirit
he
then
and
there
became
the
merciless
executioner
of
his
own
claims
to
literary
honor
and
deliberately
crushing
all
his
past
ambition
mutinous
discontent
and
uncompliant
desires
with
a
strong
he
lay
quiet
as
patiently
unmoved
as
is
a
dead
man
to
the
wrongs
inflicted
on
his
memory
and
forced
himself
to
listen
resignedly
to
every
glowing
line
of
his
no
not
his
but
poem
the
lovely
gracious
delicate
entrancing
poem
he
remembered
so
well
and
by
and
by
as
each
mellifluous
stanza
sounded
softly
on
his
ears
a
strangely
solemn
tranquillity
swept
over
him
a
most
soothing
halcyon
calm
as
though
some
passing
angel
hand
had
touched
his
brow
in
benediction
he
looked
at
not
enviously
now
but
all
admiringly
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
heard
a
sweeter
tenderer
music
than
the
story
of
nourhalma
as
recited
by
his
friend
and
so
to
that
friend
he
silently
awarded
his
own
glory
praise
and
everlasting
fame
that
glory
praise
and
fame
which
had
formerly
allured
his
fancy
as
being
the
best
of
all
the
world
could
offer
but
which
he
now
entirely
and
willingly
relinquished
in
favor
of
this
more
deserving
and
dear
comrade
whose
superior
genius
he
submissively
acknowledged
there
was
a
great
quietness
everywhere
the
rising
and
falling
inflections
of
soft
rich
voice
rather
deepened
than
disturbed
the
stillness
the
pen
of
zabastes
glided
noiselessly
over
the
slips
of
papyrus
and
the
small
sounds
of
the
outer
air
such
as
the
monotonous
hum
of
bees
among
the
masses
of
that
towered
in
white
clusters
between
the
festooned
awnings
the
thirsty
twitterimg
of
birds
hiding
under
the
long
palm
leaves
to
shelter
themselves
from
the
heat
and
the
incessant
splash
of
the
fountains
all
seemed
to
be
as
it
were
mere
appendages
to
enhance
the
breathless
hush
of
nature
presently
paused
and
zabastes
heaving
a
sigh
of
relief
looked
up
from
his
writing
and
laid
down
his
pen
work
is
finished
most
illustrious
he
demanded
a
curious
smile
playing
on
his
thin
satirical
lips
finished
echoed
disdainfully
nay
is
but
the
end
of
the
first
canto
the
scribe
gave
vent
to
a
dismal
groan
ye
gods
he
exclaimed
is
there
more
to
come
of
this
bombastic
ranting
and
vile
torturing
of
phrases
unheard
of
and
altogether
unnatural
o
marvellous
twaddler
what
a
brain
box
is
thine
how
full
of
dislocated
and
similes
gone
mad
now
as
i
live
expect
no
mercy
from
me
this
time
and
he
shook
his
head
threateningly
for
if
the
public
news
sheet
will
serve
me
as
mine
anvil
i
will
so
pound
thee
in
pieces
with
the
of
my
criticism
that
by
the
ship
of
the
sun
for
once
shall
be
moved
to
laughter
at
thee
mark
me
good
of
tinkling
foolishness
i
will
so
choose
out
and
handle
thy
feeblest
lines
that
they
shall
seem
but
the
doggerel
of
a
street
ballad
monger
i
will
give
so
bald
an
epitome
of
this
sickly
that
it
shall
appeal
to
all
who
read
my
commentary
the
veriest
trash
that
ever
poet
penned
moreover
i
can
most
admirably
misquote
thee
and
distort
thy
meanings
with
such
excellent
bitter
jesting
that
thou
thyself
shall
scarcely
recognize
thine
own
production
by
nagaya
shrine
what
a
feast
be
for
my
delectation
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
with
what
a
weight
of
withering
analysis
i
can
pulverize
this
idol
of
into
the
dust
and
ashes
of
a
common
sense
contempt
while
zabastes
thus
spoke
had
helped
himself
by
way
of
refreshment
to
two
ripe
figs
in
whose
luscious
crimson
pulp
his
white
teeth
met
with
all
the
enjoying
zest
of
a
child
healthy
appetite
he
now
held
up
the
rind
and
stalks
of
these
devoured
delicacies
and
smiled
wilt
thou
swallow
up
my
poem
in
thy
glib
clumsiness
zabastes
he
said
lightly
and
thus
wilt
them
hold
up
the
most
tasteless
portions
of
the
whole
for
the
judgment
of
the
public
is
the
manner
of
thy
craft
yet
see
and
with
a
dexterous
movement
of
his
arm
he
threw
the
through
the
window
far
out
into
the
garden
beyond
there
goes
thy
famous
criticism
and
he
and
those
that
taste
the
fruit
itself
at
first
hand
will
not
soon
forget
its
flavor
nevertheless
i
hope
indeed
that
thou
wilt
strive
to
slaughter
me
with
thy
blunt
paper
sword
i
do
most
mirthfully
relish
the
combat
in
which
i
stand
in
silence
to
receive
thy
blows
myself
unhurt
and
tranquil
as
a
marble
god
whom
ruffians
rail
upon
do
i
not
pay
thee
to
abuse
me
here
thou
crusty
soul
drink
and
be
content
and
with
a
charming
condescension
he
handed
a
full
goblet
of
wine
to
his
cantankerous
critic
who
accepted
it
ungraciously
muttering
in
his
beard
the
necessary
words
of
thanks
for
his
consideration
then
turning
to
theos
the
laureate
continued
and
thou
my
friend
what
dost
thou
think
of
so
far
hath
it
not
a
certain
exquisite
smoothness
of
rhythm
like
the
ripple
of
a
woodland
stream
through
the
reeds
and
is
there
not
a
tender
witchery
in
the
delineation
of
my
so
warmly
fair
so
wildly
passionate
methinks
she
doth
resemble
some
rich
flower
of
our
tropic
fields
blooming
at
sunset
and
dead
at
moonrise
theos
waited
a
moment
before
replying
truth
to
tell
he
was
inwardly
overcome
with
shame
to
remember
how
wantonly
he
had
copied
the
description
of
this
same
nourhalma
and
plaintively
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
unconsciously
committed
so
flagrant
a
theft
summoning
up
all
his
however
he
answered
bravely
thy
work
is
worthy
of
thyself
need
i
say
more
thou
hast
most
aptly
proved
thy
claim
upon
the
whole
gratitude
such
lofty
thoughts
such
noble
discourse
upon
love
such
high
philosophy
wherein
the
deepest
dearest
dreams
of
life
are
grandly
pictured
in
enduring
colors
these
things
are
gifts
to
poor
humanity
whereby
it
must
become
enriched
and
proud
thy
name
bright
soul
shall
be
as
a
quenchless
star
on
the
dark
brows
of
melancholy
time
men
gazing
thereat
shall
wonder
and
adore
and
even
the
least
among
thy
friends
may
also
win
from
thee
a
share
of
glory
for
simply
to
know
thee
to
listen
to
thy
utterance
might
bring
the
most
renownless
student
some
reflex
of
thine
honor
yes
thou
art
great
great
as
the
greatest
of
earth
gifted
sons
of
song
and
with
all
my
heart
i
offer
thee
my
homage
and
pride
myself
upon
the
splendor
of
thy
fame
and
as
the
eager
enthusiastic
words
came
from
his
lips
he
beheld
beautiful
countenance
brighten
more
and
more
till
it
appeared
mysteriously
transfigured
into
a
majestic
that
for
one
brief
moment
startled
him
by
the
divine
tenderness
of
its
compassionate
smile
this
expression
however
was
transitory
it
passed
and
the
dark
eyes
of
the
laureate
gleamed
with
a
merely
serene
and
affectionate
complacency
as
he
said
i
thank
thee
for
thy
praise
good
theos
thou
art
indeed
the
friendliest
of
critics
hadst
thou
thyself
been
the
author
of
thou
couldst
not
have
spoken
with
more
ardent
feeling
were
zabastes
like
thee
discerningly
just
and
reasonable
he
would
be
all
unfit
for
his
vocation
for
is
an
odd
circumstance
that
praise
in
the
public
does
a
writer
more
harm
than
good
while
and
malicious
abuse
doth
very
materially
increase
and
strengthen
his
reputation
yet
after
all
there
is
a
certain
sense
in
the
argument
for
if
much
eulogy
be
penned
by
the
cheap
scribes
the
reading
populace
at
once
imagine
these
fellows
have
been
bribed
to
give
their
approval
or
that
they
are
close
friends
and
of
the
author
whom
they
arduously
uphold
whereas
on
the
contrary
if
they
indulge
in
bitter
invective
flippant
gibing
or
clumsy
satire
like
my
amiable
zabsastes
here
and
he
made
an
airy
gesture
toward
the
silent
yet
evidently
chafing
critic
and
mark
you
is
not
bribed
but
merely
paid
fair
wages
to
fulfil
his
chosen
and
professed
calling
why
thereupon
the
multitude
exclaim
this
poet
hath
such
enemies
nay
then
how
great
a
genius
he
must
be
and
forthwith
they
clamor
for
his
work
which
if
it
speak
not
for
itself
is
then
and
only
then
to
be
deemed
faulty
and
meriting
oblivion
is
the
people
verdict
which
alone
gives
fame
and
yet
the
people
are
often
ignorant
of
what
is
noblest
and
best
in
literature
observed
theos
musingly
ignorant
in
some
ways
yes
agreed
but
in
many
others
no
they
may
be
ignorant
as
to
why
they
admire
a
certain
thing
yet
they
admire
it
all
the
same
because
their
natural
instinct
leads
them
so
to
do
and
this
is
the
special
gift
which
endows
the
uncultured
masses
with
an
occasional
sweeping
advantage
over
the
cultured
few
the
superiority
of
their
instinct
as
in
cases
of
political
revolution
for
example
while
the
finely
educated
orator
is
endeavoring
by
all
the
force
of
artful
rhetoric
to
prove
that
all
is
in
order
and
as
it
should
be
the
mob
moved
by
one
tremendous
impulse
discover
for
themselves
that
everything
is
wrong
and
moreover
that
nothing
will
come
right
unless
they
rise
up
and
take
authority
accordingly
down
go
the
thrones
and
the
colleges
the
palaces
the
temples
and
the
all
like
so
many
toys
before
the
resistless
instinct
of
the
people
who
revolt
at
injustice
and
who
feel
and
know
when
they
are
injured
though
they
are
not
clever
enough
to
explain
where
their
injury
lies
and
so
as
they
can
not
talk
about
it
coherently
any
more
than
a
lion
struck
by
an
arrow
can
give
a
learned
dissertation
on
his
wound
they
act
and
the
heat
and
fury
of
their
action
upheaves
dynasties
again
reverting
to
the
question
of
taste
and
literature
the
mob
untaught
and
untrained
in
the
subtilties
of
art
will
applaud
to
the
echo
certain
grand
and
convincing
set
forth
in
the
plays
of
the
divine
hyspiros
simply
because
they
instinctively
feel
them
to
be
truths
no
matter
how
far
they
themselves
may
be
from
acting
up
to
the
standard
of
morality
therein
contained
the
more
highly
cultured
will
hear
the
same
passages
unmoved
because
they
in
the
excess
of
artificially
gained
wisdom
have
deadened
their
instincts
so
far
that
while
they
listen
to
a
truth
pronounced
they
already
consider
how
best
they
can
confute
it
and
prove
the
same
a
lie
honest
enthusiasm
is
impossible
to
the
and
pedantic
scholar
but
on
the
other
hand
i
would
have
it
plainly
understood
that
a
mere
brief
local
popularity
is
not
fame
no
for
the
author
who
wins
the
first
never
secures
the
last
what
i
mean
is
that
a
book
or
poem
to
be
great
and
keep
its
greatness
hereafter
must
be
judged
worthy
by
the
natural
instinct
of
peoples
their
decision
i
own
may
be
tardy
their
hesitation
may
be
prolonged
through
a
hundred
or
more
years
but
their
acceptance
whether
it
be
declared
in
the
author
or
ages
after
his
death
must
be
considered
final
i
would
add
moreover
that
this
decision
has
never
yet
been
and
never
will
be
hastened
by
any
amount
of
written
criticism
it
is
the
responsive
beat
of
the
enormous
pulse
of
life
that
thrills
through
all
mankind
high
and
low
gentle
and
simple
its
great
throbs
are
slow
and
solemnly
measured
yet
if
once
it
answers
to
a
poet
touch
that
poet
name
is
made
glorious
forever
he
spoke
with
a
rush
of
earnestness
and
eloquence
that
was
both
persuasive
and
powerful
and
he
now
stood
silent
and
absorbed
his
dreamy
eyes
resting
meditatively
on
the
massive
bust
of
the
immortal
personage
he
called
hyspiros
which
smiled
out
in
serene
cold
whiteness
from
the
shrine
it
occupied
theos
watched
him
with
fascinated
and
fraternal
fondness
did
ever
man
possess
so
dulcet
a
voice
he
thought
so
grave
and
rich
and
marvellously
musical
yet
thrilling
with
such
suggestions
of
mingled
pride
and
plaintiveness
thou
art
a
most
alluring
orator
he
said
suddenly
methinks
i
could
listen
to
thee
all
day
and
never
tire
i
faith
so
could
not
i
interposed
zabastes
grimly
for
when
a
bard
begins
to
gabble
platitudes
which
merely
concern
his
own
vocation
the
gods
only
know
when
he
can
be
persuaded
to
stop
nay
more
irksome
far
than
the
recitation
of
his
professional
jingle
for
to
that
there
must
in
time
come
a
merciful
fitting
end
but
as
i
live
if
was
my
custom
to
say
prayers
i
would
pray
to
be
delivered
from
the
accursed
volubility
of
a
versifier
tongue
and
perchance
it
will
not
be
considered
out
of
my
line
of
duty
if
i
venture
to
remind
my
most
illustrious
and
renowned
master
this
with
a
withering
sneer
that
if
he
has
any
more
remarkable
nothings
to
dictate
concerning
this
particularly
inane
creation
of
his
fancy
be
well
that
we
should
proceed
therewith
for
the
hours
wax
late
and
the
sun
veereth
toward
his
house
of
noon
and
he
spread
out
fresh
slips
of
papyrus
and
again
prepared
his
long
quill
smiled
as
one
who
is
tolerant
of
the
whims
of
a
hired
buffoon
and
this
time
seating
himself
in
his
ebony
chair
was
about
to
commence
dictating
his
second
canto
when
theos
yielding
to
his
desire
to
speak
aloud
the
idea
that
had
just
flashed
across
his
brain
said
abruptly
has
it
ever
seemed
to
thee
as
it
now
does
to
me
that
there
is
a
strange
resemblance
between
thy
imaginative
description
of
the
ideal
and
the
actual
charms
and
virtues
of
thy
strayed
niphrata
looked
up
thoroughly
astonished
and
laughed
no
verily
i
have
not
traced
nor
can
i
trace
the
smallest
vestige
of
a
similarity
why
good
theos
there
is
none
not
the
least
in
the
world
for
this
heroine
of
mine
nourhalma
loves
in
vain
and
sacrifices
all
even
her
innocent
and
radiant
life
for
love
as
thou
wilt
hear
in
the
second
half
of
the
poem
moreover
she
loves
one
who
is
utterly
unworthy
of
her
faithful
tenderness
now
niphrata
is
a
child
of
delicate
caprice
she
loves
me
me
her
lord
and
methinks
i
am
not
negligent
or
undeserving
of
her
devotion
again
she
has
no
strength
of
spirit
her
timorous
blood
would
freeze
at
the
mere
thought
of
death
she
is
more
prone
to
play
with
flowers
and
sing
for
pure
delight
of
heart
than
perish
for
the
sake
of
love
is
an
unequal
simile
my
friend
as
well
compare
a
fiery
planet
with
a
twinkling
dewdrop
as
draw
a
parallel
between
the
heroic
ideal
maid
and
my
fluttering
niphrata
theos
sighed
involuntarily
but
forcing
a
smile
let
the
subject
drop
and
held
his
peace
while
taking
up
the
thread
of
his
poetical
narrative
went
on
reciting
when
the
story
began
to
ripen
toward
its
conclusion
he
grew
more
animated
rising
he
paced
the
room
as
he
declaimed
the
splendid
lines
that
now
rolled
gloriously
one
upon
another
like
billows
thundering
on
the
shore
his
gestures
were
all
indicative
of
the
fervor
of
his
inward
ecstasy
his
eyes
flashed
his
features
glowed
with
that
serene
proud
light
of
conscious
power
and
triumph
that
rests
on
the
calm
wide
brows
of
the
sculptured
apollo
and
theos
leaning
one
arm
in
a
posture
contemplated
him
with
a
curious
sensation
of
wistful
eagerness
and
passionate
pain
such
as
might
be
felt
by
some
forgotten
artist
mysteriously
permitted
to
come
out
of
his
grave
and
wander
back
to
earth
there
to
see
his
pictures
hung
in
places
of
honor
among
the
world
chief
treasures
a
strange
throb
of
melancholy
satisfaction
stirred
his
pulses
as
he
reflected
that
he
might
now
without
any
at
least
admire
the
poem
since
he
had
decided
that
was
no
longer
his
but
another
he
was
free
to
bestow
on
it
as
much
as
he
would
of
unstinting
praise
for
it
was
very
fine
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
whatever
zabastes
might
say
to
the
contrary
and
it
was
not
only
fine
but
intensely
humanly
pathetic
seeming
to
strike
a
chord
of
passion
such
as
had
never
before
been
sounded
a
chord
to
which
the
world
would
be
compelled
to
listen
yes
compelled
thought
theos
exultingly
as
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
close
of
his
dictation
the
deep
quiet
all
around
was
so
heavy
as
to
be
almost
uncomfortable
in
its
oppressiveness
it
exercised
a
sort
of
strain
upon
the
nerves
hark
what
was
that
through
the
hot
and
silent
air
swept
a
sullen
surging
noise
as
of
the
angry
shouting
of
a
vast
multitude
then
came
the
fast
and
furious
gallop
of
many
horses
and
again
that
fierce
resentful
roar
of
indignation
swelling
up
as
it
seemed
from
thousands
of
throats
moved
all
three
at
once
by
the
same
instinctive
desire
to
know
what
was
going
on
theos
and
zabastes
sprang
from
their
different
places
in
the
room
and
hurried
out
on
the
marble
terrace
dashing
aside
the
silken
awnings
as
they
went
in
order
the
better
to
see
the
open
glimpses
of
the
city
thoroughfares
that
lay
below
theos
leaning
far
out
over
the
western
half
of
the
balustrade
was
able
to
command
a
distant
view
of
the
great
square
in
which
the
huge
white
granite
obelisk
occupied
so
prominent
a
position
and
fixing
his
eyes
attentively
on
this
spot
saw
that
it
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
a
dense
mass
of
people
whose
forms
pressed
together
in
countless
numbers
swayed
restlessly
to
and
fro
like
the
rising
waves
of
a
stormy
sea
lifted
above
this
troubled
throng
one
tall
dark
figure
was
distinctly
outlined
against
the
dazzling
face
of
the
obelisk
a
figure
that
appeared
to
be
standing
on
the
back
of
the
colossal
lion
that
lay
couchant
beneath
and
as
theos
strained
his
sight
to
distinguish
the
details
of
the
scene
more
accurately
he
suddenly
beheld
a
glittering
regiment
of
mounted
men
in
armor
charging
straightly
and
with
cruelly
determined
speed
right
into
the
centre
of
the
crowd
apparently
regardless
of
all
havoc
to
life
and
limb
that
might
ensue
involuntarily
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
horror
at
what
seemed
to
him
so
wanton
and
brutal
an
act
when
just
then
caught
him
eagerly
by
the
arm
whose
soft
oval
countenance
was
brilliant
with
excitement
and
in
whose
eyes
gleamed
a
mingled
expression
of
mirth
and
ferocity
come
come
my
friend
he
said
hastily
yonder
is
a
sight
worth
seeing
is
the
mad
khosrul
who
is
thus
entrenched
and
fortified
by
the
mob
as
i
live
that
sweeping
gallop
of
his
majesty
royal
guards
is
magnificent
they
will
seize
the
prophet
this
time
without
fail
aye
if
they
slay
a
thousand
of
the
populace
in
the
performance
of
their
duty
come
let
us
hasten
to
the
scene
of
action
be
a
struggle
i
would
not
miss
for
all
the
world
he
sprang
down
the
steps
of
the
loggia
accompanied
by
theos
who
was
equally
excited
when
all
at
once
zabastes
thrusting
out
his
head
through
a
screen
of
cried
after
them
most
illustrious
what
of
the
poem
it
is
not
finished
no
matter
returned
be
finished
hereafter
and
he
hastened
on
theos
treading
close
in
his
footsteps
and
thinking
as
he
went
of
the
new
enigma
thus
proposed
to
puzzle
afresh
the
weary
workings
of
his
mind
his
poem
of
nourhalma
or
rather
the
poem
he
had
fancied
was
his
had
been
entirely
completed
down
to
the
last
line
now
was
left
to
be
finished
hereafter
strange
that
he
should
find
a
pale
glimmering
of
consolation
in
this
a
feeble
hope
that
perhaps
after
all
at
some
future
time
he
might
be
able
to
produce
a
few
a
very
few
lines
of
noble
verse
that
should
be
deemed
purely
original
enough
perchance
to
endow
him
with
a
faint
far
halo
of
diminished
glory

followed

chapter
xxiv
the
fall
of
the
obelisk
in
less
time
than
he
could
have
imagined
possible
he
found
himself
in
the
densely
crowded
square
buffeting
and
struggling
against
an
angry
and
rebellious
mob
who
half
resentful
and
half
terrified
had
evidently
set
themselves
to
resist
the
determined
charge
made
by
the
mounted
soldiery
into
their
midst
for
once
appearance
created
no
diversion
he
was
pushed
and
knocked
about
as
unceremoniously
as
if
he
were
the
commonest
citizen
of
them
all
he
seemed
carelessly
surprised
at
this
but
nevertheless
took
his
hustling
very
good
humoredly
and
keeping
his
shoulders
well
squared
forced
his
way
with
theos
by
slow
degrees
through
the
serried
ranks
of
people
many
of
whom
roused
to
a
sort
of
frenzy
threw
themselves
in
front
of
the
advancing
horses
of
the
guard
and
seizing
the
reins
held
on
to
these
like
grim
death
reckless
of
all
danger
as
yet
no
weapons
were
used
either
by
the
soldiers
or
the
populace
the
former
seemed
for
the
present
contented
to
simply
ride
down
those
who
impeded
their
progress
and
that
they
had
done
so
in
terrible
earnest
was
plainly
evident
from
the
numbers
of
wounded
creatures
that
lay
scattered
about
on
every
side
in
an
apparently
half
dying
condition
yet
there
was
surely
a
strange
insensibility
to
suffering
among
them
all
inasmuch
as
in
spite
of
the
contention
and
confusion
there
were
no
violent
shrieks
of
either
pain
or
fury
no
exclamations
of
rage
or
despair
no
sound
whatever
indeed
save
a
steady
sullen
monotonous
snarl
of
opposition
above
which
the
resonant
voice
of
the
prophet
khosrul
rang
out
like
a
silver
clarion
o
people
doomed
and
made
desolate
he
o
nation
once
mighty
brought
low
to
the
dust
of
destruction

me
ye
strong
men
and

you
ye
poor
little
children

never
again
shall
see

thousand
domes

up
the
burden
of
bitter
lamentation

it
up

your

and
the
sins
of
your

and
your

off
the
jewels
of

the
fine
raiment
let
your
tears
be
abundant
as
the
rain

kneel
down
and
cry
aloud
on
the
great
and
terrible
unknown
god
the
god
ye
have
denied
and
wronged
the
founder
of
worlds
who
doth
hold
in
his
hand
the
sun
as
a
torch
and
scattereth
stars
with
the
fire
of
his
breath
mourn
and
bend
ye
all
beneath
the
iron
stroke
of
destiny
for
know
ye
not
how
fierce
a
thing
has
come
upon
a
thing
that
lips
can
not
utter
nor
words
define
a
thing
more
horrible
than
strange
sounds
in
thick
darkness
more
deadly
than
the
lightning
when
it
leaps
from
heaven
with
intent
to
slay
o

thy
marble
palaces

already
ringed
round
with

river
of
blood
the
temples
of
thy
knowledge
wherein
thy
wise
men
have
studied
to
exceed
all
wisdom
begin
to
totter
to
their
fall
thou
shalt
be
swept
away
even
as
a
light
heap
of
ashes
and
what
shall
all
thy
learning
avail
thee
in
that
brief
and
fearful
end
hear
me
o

and
cease
to
strive
among
yourselves

not
thus
desperately
the
king
armed
minions
for

also
speak
and
say
lo
the
time
approaches
when
a
stronger
hand
than
that
of
the
mighty
zephoranim
shall
take
me
prisoner
and
bear
me
hence
where
most
i
long
to

i
command
you
in
the
name
of
that
god
whose
truth
i
do
proclaim
peace
as
he
uttered
the
last
word
an
instantaneous
hush
fell
upon
the
crowd
every
head
was
turned
toward
his
grand
gaunt
almost
spectral
figure
and
even
the
mounted
soldiery
reined
up
their
plunging
chafing
steeds
and
remained
motionless
as
though
suddenly
fixed
to
the
ground
by
some
powerful
magnetic
spell
theos
and
took
immediate
advantage
of
this
lull
in
the
conflict
to
try
and
secure
for
themselves
a
better
point
of
vantage
though
there
was
much
difficulty
in
pressing
through
the
closely
packed
throng
inasmuch
as
not
a
man
moved
to
give
them
presently
however
managed
to
reach
the
nearest
one
of
the
two
great
fountains
which
adorned
either
side
of
the
obelisk
and
springing
as
lightly
as
a
bird
on
its
marble
edge
he
stood
erect
there
his
picturesque
form
presenting
itself
to
the
view
like
a
fine
statue
set
against
the
background
of
foaming
water
that
dashed
high
above
him
and
sprinkled
his
garments
with
drops
of
sparkling
spray
theos
at
once
joined
him
and
the
two
friends
holding
each
other
fast
by
the
arm
gazed
down
on
the
silent
mighty
multitude
around
them
a
huge
concourse
of
the
citizens
of
who
strange
as
this
part
of
their
behavior
seemed
still
paid
no
heed
to
the
presence
of
their
laureate
but
with
pale
rapt
faces
and
anxious
frightened
eyes
riveted
their
attention
entirely
on
the
sombre
prophet
whose
thin
ghostly
arms
outstretched
above
them
appeared
to
mutely
invoke
in
their
behalf
some
special
miracle
of
mercy
see
you
not
whispered
to
his
companion
how
yon
aged
fool
wears
upon
his
breast
the
symbol
of
his
own
prophecy
is
the
maddest
freak
to
thus
display
his
only
a
month
ago
the
king
issued
a
decree
warning
all
those
whom
it
might
concern
that
any
one
of
his
born
subjects
presuming
to
carry
the
sign
of
khosrul
newly
invented
faith
should
surely
die
and
that
the
crazed
reprobate
carries
it
himself
makes
no
exemption
from
the
rule
theos
shuddered
his
eyes
were
misty
but
he
could
very
well
see
the
emblem
to
which
alluded
it
was
the
cross
again
the
same
sacred
prefigurement
of
things
to
come
according
to
the
perplexing
explanation
given
by
the
mystic
zuriel
whom
he
had
met
in
the
passage
of
the
tombs
though
to
his
own
mind
it
conveyed
no
such
meaning
what
was
it
then
if
not
a
prototype
of
the
future
was
it
a
record
of
the
past
he
dared
not
pursue
this
question
it
seemed
to
send
his
brain
reeling
on
the
verge
of
madness
he
made
no
answer
to
remark
but
fixed
his
gaze
wistfully
on
the
tall
melancholy
shape
that
like
a
black
shadow
darkened
the
whiteness
of
the
obelisk
and
his
sense
of
hearing
became
acute
almost
to
painfulness
when
once
more
khosrul
deep
vibrating
tones
peeled
solemnly
through
the
heavy
air
god
speaks
to
and
as
the
prophet
enunciated
these
words
with
majestic
emphasis
a
visible
thrill
ran
through
the
hushed
god
saith
get
thee
up
o
thou
city
of
pleasure
from
thy
couch
of
sweet
wantonness
get
thee
up
gird
thee
with
fire
and
flee
into
the
desert
of
forgotten
things
for
thou
art
become
a
blot
on
the
fairness
of
my
world
and
a
shame
to
the
brightness
of
my
heaven
thy
rulers
are
corrupt
thy
teachers
are
proud
of
heart
and
narrow
in
judgment
thy
young
men
and
maidens
go
astray
and
follow
each
after
their
own
vain
opinions
in
thy
great
temples
and
holy
places
falsehood
abides
and
vice
holds
court
in
thy
glorious
palaces
wherefore
because
thou
hast
neither
sought
nor
served
me
and
because
thou
hast
set
up
gold
as
thy
god
and
a
multitude
of
riches
as
thy
chief
good
lo
now
mine
eyes
have
grown
weary
of
beholding
thee
and
i
will
descend
upon
thee
suddenly
and
destroy
thee
even
as
a
hill
of
sand
is
destroyed
by
the
whirlwind
and
thou
shalt
be
known
in
the
land
of
my
creatures
no
more
woe
to
thee
that
thou
hast
taken
pride
in
thy
wisdom
and
learning
for
therein
lies
thy
much
wickedness
if
thou
wert
truly
wise
thou
wouldst
have
found
me
if
thou
wert
nobly
learned
thou
wouldst
have
understood
my
laws
but
thou
art
proved
altogether
gross
foolish
and
incapable
and
the
studies
whereof
thou
hast
boasted
the
writings
of
thy
wise
men
the
charts
of
sea
and
land
the
maps
of
thy
chief
astronomers
the
engraved
tablets
of
learning
in
gold
in
silver
in
ivory
in
stone
thy
chronicles
of
battle
and
conquest
the
documents
of
thine
explorers
in
far
countries
the
engines
of
thine
invention
whereby
thou
dost
press
the
lightning
into
thy
service
and
make
the
air
respond
to
the
messages
of
thy
kings
and
councillors
all
these
shall
be
thrust
away
into
an
everlasting
silence
and
no
man
hereafter
shall
be
able
to
declare
that
such
things
have
ever
been
here
the
speaker
paused
and
theos
surveying
the
vast
listening
crowds
fancied
they
looked
like
an
audience
of
moveless
ghosts
rather
than
human
beings
so
still
so
pallid
so
grave
were
they
one
and
all
khosrul
continued
in
softer
more
melancholy
accents
that
while
plaintive
were
still
singularly
impressive
o
my
my
beloved
he
exclaimed
extending
his
arms
with
a
vehemently
pleading
gesture
as
though
in
the
excess
of
emotion
he
would
have
drawn
all
the
people
to
his
ye
unhappy
ones
have
i
not
given
ye
warning
have
i
not
bidden
ye
beware
of
this
great
evil
which
should
come
to
pass
evil
for
which
there
is
no
remedy
none
neither
in
the
earth
nor
the
sea
nor
the
invisible
comforts
of
the
air
for
god
hath
spoken
and
who
shall
contradict
the
thunder
of
his
voice
behold
the
end
is
at
hand
of
all
the
pleasant
things
of
the
feasting
and
the
musical
assemblies
the
and
the
the
labors
of
students
and
the
triumphs
of
sages
all
these
shall
seem
but
the
mockery
of
madness
in
the
night
of
overwhelming
destruction
woe
is
me
that
ye
would
not
listen
when
i
called
but
turned
every
man
to
his
own
devices
and
the
following
after
idols
nay
now
what
will
ye
do
in
extremity
will
ye
chant
hymns
to
the
sun
lo
he
is
deaf
and
blind
for
all
his
golden
glory
and
is
but
a
taper
set
in
the
window
of
the
sky
to
be
extinguished
at
god
good
pleasure
will
ye
supplicate
nagaya
o
fools
and
desperate
how
shall
a
brute
beast
answer
prayer
vain
vain
is
all
beseeching
shut
forever
are
the
doors
of
escape
therefore
cover
yourselves
with
the
garments
of
burial
prepare
each
one
his
grave
and
rich
funeral
things
gather
together
the
rosemary
and
myrrh
the
precious
ointments
and
essences
the
strings
of
gold
and
the
jewelled
talismans
whereby
ye
think
to
fight
against
corruption
and
fall
down
every
man
in
his
own
wrought
hollow
in
the
ground
face
turned
to
earth
and
die
for
death
hath
broken
through
the
strong
gates
of
and
hath
taken
the
city
magnificent
captive
unknowingly
alas
alas
that
ye
would
not
follow
whither
i
led
that
ye
would
not
hearken
to
the
vision
of
the
future
dimly
yet
gloriously
revealed
the
future
the
future
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
raising
his
eyes
to
the
deep
blue
sky
above
him
seemed
for
a
moment
as
though
he
were
caught
up
in
the
cloud
of
some
wondrous
dream
still
the
enormous
throng
of
people
stood
hushed
and
motionless
not
a
word
not
a
sound
escaped
them
there
was
something
positively
appalling
in
such
absolute
immobility
at
least
it
appeared
so
to
theos
who
could
not
understand
this
dispassionate
behavior
on
the
part
of
so
large
and
lately
excited
a
multitude
all
at
once
a
voice
marvellously
tender
clear
and
pathetic
trembled
on
the
silence
was
it
could
it
be
the
voice
of
khosrul
yes
but
so
changed
so
solemn
so
infinitely
sweet
that
it
might
have
been
some
gentle
angel
speaking
like
a
fountain
of
sweet
water
in
the
desert
or
the
rising
of
the
moon
in
a
gloomy
midnight
he
said
slowly
even
so
is
the
hope
and
promise
of
the
supremely
beloved
through
the
veiling
darkness
of
the
coming
ages
his
light
already
shines
upon
my
soul
o
blessed
advent
o
happy
future
o
days
when
privileged
humanity
shall
bridge
by
love
the
gulf
between
this
world
and
heaven
what
shall
be
said
of
him
who
cometh
to
redeem
us
o
my
foreseeing
spirit
what
shall
be
told
concerning
his
most
marvellous
beauty
even
as
a
dove
that
for
pity
of
its
helpless
younglings
doth
battle
with
a
storm
even
so
shall
he
descend
from
out
his
glory
sempiternal
and
teach
us
how
to
conquer
sin
and
death
aye
even
with
the
meekness
of
a
little
child
he
shall
approach
and
choose
his
dwelling
here
among
us
o
heavenly
child
o
wisdom
of
god
contained
in
innocence
happy
the
learning
that
shall
learn
from
thee
noble
the
pride
that
shall
humble
itself
before
thy
gentleness
footnote
the
idea
of
a
saviour
who
should
be
born
as
man
to
redeem
the
world
was
prevalent
among
all
nations
and
dates
from
the
remotest
ages
coming
down
to
what
must
be
termed
quite
a
modern
period
compared
to
that
in
which
the
city
of
had
its
existence
we
find
that
the
romans
under
octavius
caesar
were
wont
to
exclaim
at
their
sacred
meetings
the
times
foretold
by
the
sybil
are
arrived
may
a
new
age
soon
restore
that
saturn
soon
may
the
child
be
born
who
shall
banish
the
age
of
iron
tacitus
and
suetonius
both
mention
the
prophecies
in
the
sacred
books
of
the
priests
which
declare
that
the
east
shall
be
in
commotion
and
that
men
from
judea
shall
subject
everything
to
their
dominion
o
prince
of
manhood
and
divinity
entwined
thou
shalt
acquaint
thyself
with
human
griefs
and
patiently
unravel
the
perplexities
of
human
longings
to
prove
thy
sacred
sympathy
with
suffering
thou
shalt
be
content
to
suffer
to
explain
the
mystery
of
death
thou
shalt
even
be
content
to
die
o
people
of
hear
ye
all
the
words
that
tell
of
this
wonderful
inestimable
king
of
peace
mine
aged
eyes
do
see
him
now
far
far
off
in
the
rising
mist
of
unformed
future
things
the
cross
the
cross
on
which
his
man
pure
life
dissolves
itself
in
glory
stretches
above
me
in
spreading
beams
of
light
ah
is
a
glittering
pathway
in
the
skies
whereon
men
and
the
angels
meet
and
know
each
other
he
is
the
strong
and
perfect
spirit
that
shall
break
loose
from
death
and
declare
the
insignificance
of
the
grave
he
is
the
lingering
star
in
the
east
that
shall
rise
and
lighten
all
spiritual
darkness
the
unknown
unnamed
redeemer
of
the
world
the
saviour
that
shall
come
shall
come
cried
theos
suddenly
roused
to
the
utmost
pitch
of
frenzied
excitement
and
pronouncing
each
word
with
loud
and
involuntary
vehemence
nay
for
he
has
come
he
died
for
us
and
rose
again
from
the
dead
more
than
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
a
frightful
silence
followed
a
breathless
cessation
of
even
the
faintest
quiver
of
sound
the
mighty
mass
of
people
apparently
moved
by
one
accord
turned
with
swift
stealthy
noiselessness
toward
the
audacious
speaker
thousands
of
glittering
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
in
solemnly
inquiring
wonderment
while
he
himself
now
altogether
dismayed
at
the
effect
of
his
own
rash
utterance
thought
he
had
never
experienced
a
more
awful
moment
for
it
was
as
though
all
the
skeletons
he
had
lately
seen
in
the
passage
of
the
tombs
had
suddenly
clothed
themselves
with
spectral
flesh
and
hair
and
the
shadowy
garments
of
men
and
had
advanced
into
broad
daylight
to
surround
him
in
their
terrible
lifeless
ranks
and
wrench
from
him
the
secret
of
an
concerning
which
they
were
ignorant
how
ghostly
and
drear
seemed
that
dense
crowd
in
this
new
light
of
his
delirious
fancy
a
clammy
dew
broke
out
on
his
forehead
he
saw
the
blue
skies
the
huge
buildings
in
the
square
the
obelisk
the
fountains
the
trees
all
whirling
round
him
in
a
wild
dance
of
the
dizziest
distraction
when
rich
voice
close
to
his
ear
recalled
his
wandering
senses
why
man
art
thou
drunk
or
mad
and
the
laureate
face
expressed
a
kind
of
sarcastic
astonishment
what
a
fool
thou
hast
made
of
thyself
good
comrade
by
my
soul
how
shall
thy
condition
be
explained
to
these
starers
below
see
how
they
gape
upon
thee
thou
art
most
assuredly
a
noticeable
spectacle
and
yon
maniac
prophet
doth
evidently
judge
thee
as
one
of
his
craft
a
fellow
professional
howler
of
marvels
else
he
would
scarcely
deign
to
fix
his
eyes
so
obstinately
on
thy
countenance
nay
verily
thou
dost
outrival
him
in
the
strangeness
of
thy
language
what
moved
thee
to
such
frenzied
utterance
surely
thou
hast
a
stroke
of
the
sun
thy
words
were
most
absolutely
devoid
of
reason
as
senseless
as
the
jabber
of
an
idiot
to
his
own
shadow
on
the
wall
theos
was
mute
he
had
no
defense
to
offer
the
crowd
still
stared
upon
him
and
his
heart
beat
fast
with
a
mingled
sense
of
fear
and
pride
fear
of
his
present
surroundings
pride
that
he
had
spoken
out
his
conviction
boldly
reckless
of
all
consequences
and
this
pride
was
a
most
curious
thing
to
analyze
because
it
did
not
so
much
consist
in
the
fact
of
his
having
openly
confessed
his
inward
thought
as
that
he
felt
he
had
gained
some
special
victory
in
thus
acknowledging
his
belief
in
the
positive
existence
of
the
saviour
who
formed
the
subject
of
khosrul
prophecy
full
of
a
singular
sort
of
which
yet
had
nothing
to
do
with
selfishness
he
became
so
absorbed
in
his
own
reflections
that
he
started
like
a
man
brusquely
aroused
from
sleep
when
the
prophet
strong
grave
voice
apostrophized
him
personally
over
the
heads
of
the
throng
who
and
what
art
thou
that
dost
speak
of
the
future
as
though
it
were
the
past
hast
thou
held
converse
with
the
angels
and
is
past
and
future
one
with
thee
in
the
dream
of
the
departing
present
answer
me
thou
stranger
to
the
city
of
has
god
taught
thee
the
way
to
everlasting
life
again
that
awful
silence
made
itself
felt
like
a
deadly
chill
on
the
sunlit
air
the
quiet
patient
crowds
seemed
waiting
in
hushed
suspense
for
some
reply
which
should
be
as
a
flash
of
spiritual
enlightenment
to
leap
from
one
to
the
other
with
kindling
heat
and
radiance
and
vivify
them
all
into
a
new
and
happier
existence
but
now
when
theos
most
strongly
desired
to
speak
he
remained
dumb
as
stone
vainly
he
struggled
against
and
contended
with
the
invisible
mysterious
and
relentless
despotism
that
smote
him
on
the
mouth
as
it
were
and
deprived
him
of
all
power
of
utterance
his
tongue
was
stiff
and
frozen
his
very
lips
were
sealed
trembling
violently
he
gazed
beseechingly
at
who
held
his
arm
in
a
firm
and
friendly
grasp
and
who
apparently
quickly
perceiving
that
he
was
distressed
and
embarrassed
undertook
himself
to
furnish
forth
what
he
evidently
considered
a
fitting
response
to
khosrul
adjuration
most
venerable
seer
he
cried
mockingly
his
bright
face
radiant
with
mirth
and
his
dark
eyes
flashing
a
careless
contempt
as
he
spoke
thou
art
as
as
thine
own
auguries
if
thou
canst
not
at
once
comprehend
the
drift
of
my
friend
humor
he
hath
caught
the
infection
of
thy
fanatic
eloquence
and
like
thee
knows
naught
of
what
he
says
moreover
he
hath
good
wine
and
sunlight
mingled
in
his
blood
whereby
he
hath
been
doubtless
moved
to
play
a
jest
upon
thee
i
pray
thee
heed
him
not
he
is
as
free
to
declare
thy
prophecy
is
of
the
past
as
thou
art
to
insist
on
its
being
of
the
future
in
both
ways
is
a
most
foolish
fallacy
nevertheless
continue
thy
entertaining
discourse
sir
graybeard
and
if
thou
must
needs
address
thyself
to
any
one
soul
in
particular
why
let
it
be
me
for
though
thanks
to
mine
own
excellent
good
sense
i
have
no
faith
in
angels
nor
crosses
nor
everlasting
life
nor
any
of
the
strange
riddles
wherewith
thou
seekest
to
perplex
and
bewilder
the
brains
of
the
ignorant
still
am
i
laureate
of
the
realm
and
ready
to
hold
argument
with
thee
yea
until
such
time
as
these
dumfounded
soldiers
and
citizens
of
shall
remember
their
duty
sufficiently
to
seize
and
take
thee
captive
in
the
king
great
name
as
he
ceased
a
deep
sigh
ran
like
the
first
sound
of
a
rising
wind
among
trees
through
the
heretofore
motionless
multitude
a
faint
dawning
yet
doubtful
smile
reflected
itself
on
their
faces
and
the
old
familiar
shout
broke
feebly
from
their
lips
hail
let
us
hear
looked
down
upon
them
all
in
airy
derision
o
fickle
fools
he
exclaimed
o
thankless
and
disloyal
people
what
ye
will
see
me
now
ye
will
hear
me
aye
but
who
shall
answer
for
your
obedience
to
my
words
nay
is
it
possible
that
i
your
country
chosen
chief
minstrel
should
have
stood
so
long
among
ye
disregarded
how
comes
it
your
dull
eyes
and
ears
were
fixed
so
fast
upon
yon
dotard
miscreant
whose
days
are
numbered
methought
but
voice
that
could
persuade
ye
to
assemble
thus
in
such
since
when
have
the
poet
and
the
people
of
ceased
to
be
as
one
a
vague
muttering
sound
answered
him
whether
of
shame
or
dissatisfaction
it
was
difficult
to
tell
khosrul
vibrating
accent
struck
sharply
across
that
muffled
murmur
the
poet
and
the
people
of
are
further
asunder
than
light
and
darkness
he
cried
vehemently
for
the
poet
has
been
false
to
his
high
vocation
and
the
people
trust
in
him
no
more
there
was
an
instant
hush
a
hush
as
it
seemed
of
grieved
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
the
populace
and
during
that
brief
pause
theos
heart
gave
a
fierce
bound
against
his
ribs
as
though
some
one
had
suddenly
shot
at
him
with
a
poisoned
arrow
he
glanced
quickly
at
but
stood
calmly
unmoved
his
handsome
head
thrown
back
a
cynical
smile
on
his
lips
and
his
eyes
darker
than
ever
with
an
intensity
of
unutterable
scorn
and
the
piercing
reproachful
voice
of
the
prophet
penetrated
every
part
of
the
spacious
square
like
a
sonorous
bell
ringing
over
a
still
landscape
o
divine
spirit
of
song
pent
up
in
gross
clay
was
ever
mortal
more
gifted
than
thou
in
thee
was
kindled
the
white
fire
of
heaven
to
thee
were
confided
the
memories
of
vanished
worlds
for
thee
god
bade
his
nature
wear
a
thousand
shapes
of
varied
meaning
the
sun
the
moon
the
stars
were
appointed
as
thy
servants
for
thou
wert
born
poet
the
mystically
chosen
teacher
and
consoler
of
mankind
what
hast
thou
done
what
hast
thou
done
with
the
treasures
bestowed
upon
thee
by
the
angels
how
hast
thou
used
the
talisman
of
thy
genius
to
comfort
the
afflicted
to
dethrone
and
destroy
the
oppressor
to
uphold
the
cause
of
justice
to
rouse
the
noblest
instincts
of
thy
race
to
elevate
and
purify
the
world
alas
alas
thou
hast
made
thyself
the
idol
of
thy
muse
and
thou
being
but
perishable
thy
fame
shall
perish
with
thee
thou
hast
drowsed
away
thy
manhood
in
the
lap
of
vice
thou
hast
slept
and
dreamed
when
thou
should
have
been
awake
and
vigilant
not
i
but
thou
shouldst
have
warned
the
people
of
their
coming
doom
not
i
but
thou
shouldst
have
marked
the
threatening
signs
of
the
pregnant
hour
not
i
but
thou
shouldst
have
perceived
the
first
faint
glimmer
of
god
future
scheme
of
glad
salvation
not
i
but
thou
shouldst
have
taught
and
pleaded
and
swayed
by
thy
matchless
sceptre
of
sweet
song
the
passions
of
thy
countrymen
hadst
thou
been
true
to
that
first
flame
of
thought
within
thee
o
how
thy
glory
would
have
dwarfed
the
power
of
kings
empires
might
have
fallen
cities
decayed
and
nations
been
absorbed
in
ruin
and
yet
thy
voice
rendered
imperishable
by
its
faithfulness
should
have
sounded
forth
in
triumph
above
the
foundering
wrecks
of
time
o
poet
unworthy
of
thy
calling
how
thou
hast
wantoned
with
the
sacred
muse
how
thou
hast
led
her
stainless
feet
into
the
mire
of
sensual
hypocrisies
and
decked
her
with
the
trumpery
of
a
meaningless
fair
speech
how
thou
hast
caught
her
by
the
virginal
hair
and
made
her
chastity
the
screen
for
all
thine
own
licentiousness
thou
shouldst
have
humbly
sought
her
benediction
thou
shouldst
have
handled
her
with
gentle
reverence
and
patient
ardor
from
her
wise
lips
thou
shouldst
have
learned
how
best
to
practice
those
virtues
whose
praise
thou
didst
evasively
proclaim
thou
shouldst
have
shrined
her
throned
her
worshiped
her
and
served
her
yea
even
as
a
sinful
man
may
serve
an
angel
who
loves
him
ah
what
a
strange
cold
thrill
ran
through
theos
as
he
heard
these
last
words
a
sinful
man
may
serve
an
angel
who
loves
him
how
happy
the
man
thus
loved
how
fortunate
the
sinner
thus
permitted
to
serve
who
was
he
could
there
be
any
one
so
marvellously
privileged
he
wondered
dimly
and
a
dull
aching
pain
throbbed
heavily
in
his
brows
it
was
a
very
singular
thing
too
that
he
should
find
himself
strongly
and
personally
affected
by
khosrul
address
to
yet
such
was
the
case
so
much
so
indeed
that
he
accepted
all
the
prophet
reproaches
as
though
they
applied
solely
to
his
own
past
life
he
could
not
understand
his
emotion
nevertheless
he
kept
on
dreamily
regretting
that
things
were
as
khosrul
had
said
that
he
had
not
fulfilled
his
vocation
and
that
he
had
neither
been
humble
enough
nor
devout
enough
nor
unselfish
enough
to
deserve
the
high
and
imperial
name
of
poet
round
and
round
like
a
flying
mote
this
troublesome
idea
circled
in
his
brain
he
must
do
better
in
future
he
resolved
supposing
that
any
future
remained
to
him
in
which
to
work
he
must
redeem
the
past
here
he
roused
his
mental
faculties
with
a
start
and
forced
himself
to
realize
that
it
was
to
whom
the
prophet
spoke
only
not
himself
then
straightway
he
became
indignant
on
his
friend
behalf
why
should
be
blamed
was
a
glorious
poet
a
of
singers
his
fume
must
and
should
endure
forever
thus
thinking
he
regained
his
composure
by
degrees
and
strove
to
assume
the
same
air
of
easy
indifference
as
that
exhibited
by
his
companion
when
again
khosrul
declamatory
tones
thundered
forth
with
an
absoluteness
of
emphasis
that
was
both
startling
and
convincing
hear
me
chief
minstrel
of
hear
me
thou
who
hast
willfully
wasted
the
golden
moments
of
time
thou
art
marked
out
for
death
death
sudden
and
fierce
as
the
leap
of
the
desert
panther
on
its
prey
death
that
shall
come
to
thee
through
the
traitorous
speech
of
the
evil
woman
whose
beauty
has
sapped
thy
strength
and
rendered
thy
glory
inglorious
death
that
for
thee
alas
shall
be
mournful
and
utter
oblivion
naught
shall
it
avail
to
thee
that
thy
musical
weaving
of
words
hath
been
graven
seven
times
over
on
tablets
of
stone
and
agate
and
ivory
of
gold
and
white
silex
and
porphyry
and
the
unbreakable
none
of
these
shall
suffice
to
keep
thy
name
in
remembrance
for
what
can
not
be
broken
shall
be
melted
with
flame
and
what
can
not
be
erased
shall
be
buried
miles
deep
in
the
bosom
of
earth
whence
it
never
again
shall
be
lifted
into
the
light
of
day
aye
thou
shalt
be
forgotten
forgotten
as
though
thou
hadst
never
sung
other
poets
shall
chant
in
the
world
yet
maybe
none
so
well
as
thou
other
laurel
and
myrtle
wreaths
shall
be
given
by
countries
and
kings
to
bards
unworthy
of
whom
none
perchance
shall
have
thy
sweetness
but
thou
thou
the
most
grandly
gifted
poet
the
world
has
ever
known
shalt
be
cast
among
the
dust
of
unremembered
nothings
and
the
name
of
shall
carry
no
meaning
to
any
man
born
in
the
coming
for
thou
hast
cherished
within
thyself
the
poison
that
withers
thee
the
deadly
poison
of
doubt
the
denial
of
existence
the
accursed
blankness
of
disbelief
in
the
things
of
the
life
eternal
wherefore
thy
spirit
is
that
of
one
lost
and
rebellious
whose
best
works
are
futile
whose
days
are
void
of
example
and
whose
carelessly
grasped
torch
of
song
shall
be
suddenly
snatched
from
thy
hand
and
extinguished
in
darkness
god
pardon
thee
dying
poet
god
give
thy
parting
soul
a
chance
of
penance
and
of
sweet
redemption

thee
in
that
drear
land
of
shadow
whither
thou

bound
god

as
thou

thee
in
thy
last
agony
fallen
angel
from
thy
peers
farewell
the
effect
of
these
strange
words
was
so
extraordinarily
impressive
that
for
one
instant
the
astonished
and
evidently
affrighted
crowds
pressed
round
eagerly
staring
at
him
in
morbid
fear
and
wonder
as
though
they
expected
him
to
drop
dead
before
them
in
immediate
fulfillment
of
the
prophet
solemn
valediction
theos
oppressed
by
an
inward
sickening
sense
of
terror
also
regarded
him
with
close
and
anxious
solicitude
but
was
almost
reassured
at
the
first
glance
never
was
a
greater
opposition
offered
to
khosrul
gloomy
prognostications
than
that
contained
in
the
handsome
laureate
aspect
at
that
moment
his
supple
graceful
figure
alert
with
life
his
glowing
face
flushed
by
the
sun
and
touched
with
that
faintly
amused
look
of
serene
scorn
his
glorious
eyes
brilliant
as
jewels
under
their
drooping
amorous
lids
and
the
regal
poise
of
his
splendid
shoulders
and
throat
as
he
lifted
his
head
a
little
more
haughtily
than
usual
and
glanced
indifferently
down
from
his
foothold
on
the
edge
of
the
fountain
at
the
upturned
questioning
faces
of
the
throng
all
even
to
the
careless
balance
and
ease
of
his
attitude
betokened
his
perfect
condition
of
health
and
the
entire
satisfaction
he
had
in
the
consciousness
of
his
own
strength
and
beauty
he
seemed
about
to
speak
and
raised
his
hand
with
the
graceful
yet
commanding
gesture
of
one
accustomed
to
the
art
of
elegant
rhetoric
when
suddenly
his
expression
changed
shrugging
his
shoulders
lightly
as
who
should
here
comes
the
conclusion
of
the
matter
no
time
for
further
argument
he
silently
pointed
across
the
square
while
a
smile
dazzling
yet
cruel
played
on
his
delicately
parted
lips
a
smile
the
covert
meaning
of
which
was
soon
explained
for
all
at
once
a
brazen
roar
of
trumpets
split
the
silence
into
torn
and
discordant
echoes
the
crowd
turned
swiftly
and
seeing
who
it
was
that
approached
rushed
hither
and
thither
in
the
wildest
confusion
making
as
though
they
would
have
fled
and
in
less
than
a
minute
a
gleaming
cohort
of
mounted
and
armed
spearmen
galloped
furiously
into
the
thick
of
the
melee
following
these
came
a
superb
car
drawn
by
six
horses
that
plunged
and
pranced
through
the
multitude
with
no
more
heed
than
if
these
groups
of
living
beings
had
been
mere
sheafs
of
corn
a
car
flashing
from
end
to
end
with
gold
and
precious
stones
in
which
towered
the
erect
massive
form
of
zephoranim
the
king
his
dark
face
was
ablaze
with
wrath
tightly
grasping
the
reins
of
his
reckless
steeds
he
drew
himself
haughtily
upright
and
turned
his
rolling
fierce
black
eyes
indignantly
from
side
to
side
on
the
scared
people
as
he
drove
through
their
retreating
ranks
smiting
down
and
mangling
with
the
sharp
spikes
of
his
tall
men
women
and
children
without
care
or
remorse
till
he
forced
his
terrible
passage
straight
to
the
foot
of
the
obelisk
there
he
came
to
an
abrupt
standstill
and
lifting
high
his
strong
hand
and
brawny
arm
glittering
with
jewels
he
cried
soldiers
seize
yon
traitorous
rebel
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
for
the
capture
of
khosrul
there
was
an
instant
of
hesitation
not
one
of
the
populace
stirred
to
obey
the
order
then
suddenly
as
though
released
by
their
command
from
some
mesmeric
spell
the
before
inactive
mounted
guards
started
into
action
cantered
sharply
forward
and
surrounded
the
obelisk
while
the
armed
spearsmen
closed
together
and
made
a
swift
advance
upon
the
venerable
figure
that
stood
alone
and
defenseless
tranquilly
awaiting
their
approach
but
there
was
evidently
some
unknown
and
mysterious
force
pent
up
within
the
prophet
feeble
frame
for
when
the
soldiers
were
just
about
an
arm
length
from
him
they
seemed
all
at
once
troubled
and
irresolute
and
turned
their
looks
away
as
though
fearing
to
gaze
too
steadfastly
upon
that
grand
countenance
in
which
the
eyes
made
young
by
inward
fervor
blazed
forth
with
unearthly
lustre
beneath
a
silvery
halo
of
tossed
white
hair
zephoranim
perceived
this
touch
of
indecision
on
the
part
of
his
men
and
his
black
brows
contracted
in
an
ominous
frown
halt
he
shouted
fiercely
apparently
to
make
it
seem
to
the
mob
that
the
pause
in
the
action
of
the
soldiery
was
in
compliance
with
his
own
behest
halt
bind
him
and
bring
him
hither
i
myself
will
slay
him
halt
echoed
a
voice
discordantly
sharp
and
halt
thou
also
great
zephoranim
for
death
bars
thy
further
progress
and
khosrul
manifestly
possessed
by
some
superhuman
access
of
frenzy
leaped
from
his
position
on
the
back
of
the
stone
lion
and
slipping
agilely
through
the
ranks
of
the
startled
spearmen
and
guards
who
were
all
unprepared
for
the
suddenness
and
rapidity
of
his
movements
he
sprang
boldly
on
the
edge
of
the
royal
chariot
and
there
clung
to
the
jewelled
wheel
looking
like
a
gaunt
aerial
spectre
an
ambassador
of
coming
ruin
the
king
speechless
with
amazement
and
fury
dragged
at
his
huge
sword
till
he
wrenched
it
out
of
its
sheath
raising
it
he
whirled
it
round
his
head
so
that
it
gave
a
murderous
hiss
in
the
air
and
was
his
strong
arm
paralyzed
that
he
forbore
to
strike
zephoranim
khosrul
in
terms
that
were
piercing
and
dolorous
as
the
whistling
of
the
wind
among
hollow
reeds
zephoranim
thou
shalt
die
art
thou
ready
art
thou
ready
proud
king
ready
to
be
made
less
than
the
lowest
of
the
low
hush
hush
and
his
aged
face
took
upon
itself
a
ghastly
greenish
pallor
hear
you
not
the
muttering
of
the
thunder
underground
there
are
strange
powers
at
work
powers
of
the
undug
earth
and
unfathomed
sea
hark
how
they
tear
at
the
stately
foundations
of
flame
flame
it
is
already
kindled
it
shall
enwrap
thee
with
more
closeness
than
thy
coronation
robe
o
mighty
sovereign
with
more
gloating
fondness
than
the
arms
of
thy
beloved
listen
zephoranim
listen
here
he
stretched
out
his
skinny
hand
and
pointed
upwards
his
eyes
grew
fixed
and
glassy
his
throat
rattled
convulsively
at
that
moment
the
monarch
recovering
his
once
more
lifted
his
sword
with
direct
and
deadly
aim
but
the
prophet
uttering
a
wild
shriek
caught
at
his
descending
wrist
and
gripped
it
fast
see
he
put
up
thy
weapon
thou
shalt
never
need
it
where
thou
art
summoned
lo
how
yon
letters
blaze
against
the
blue
of
heaven
there
there
it
comes
read
is
written
shall
fall
and
the
king
shall
die
hist
hist
dumb
oracles
speak
and
dead
voices
find
tongue
hark
how
they
chant
together
the
old
forgotten
warning
the
high
priestess
is
the
king
mistress
then
fall
fall
aye
the
city
of
a
thousand
palaces
shall
fall
o
night
of
desperate
horror
and
thou
o
king
shalt
die
and
as
he
shrilled
the
last
word
on
the
air
with
terrific
emphasis
he
threw
up
his
arms
like
a
man
suddenly
shot
and
reeling
backward
fell
heavily
on
the
ground
a
corpse
a
great
cry
went
up
from
the
crowd
the
king
leaned
eagerly
out
of
his
car
is
the
fool
dead
or
feigning
death
he
demanded
addressing
one
of
a
group
of
soldiers
standing
near
the
officer
stooped
and
felt
the
motionless
body
o
great
king
live
forever
he
is
dead
zephoranim
hesitated
cruelty
and
clemency
struggled
for
the
mastery
in
the
varying
expression
of
his
frowning
face
but
cruelty
conquered
grasping
his
sword
firmly
he
bent
still
further
forward
out
of
his
chariot
and
with
one
swift
keen
stroke
severed
the
lifeless
prophet
head
from
its
trunk
and
taking
it
up
on
the
point
of
his
weapon
showed
it
to
the
multitude
a
smothered
shuddering
sigh
that
was
half
a
groan
rippled
through
the
dense
throng
a
sound
that
evidently
added
fresh
irritation
to
the
already
heated
temper
of
the
haughty
sovereign
with
a
savage
laugh
he
tossed
his
piteous
trophy
on
the
pavement
where
it
lay
in
a
pool
of
its
own
blood
the
white
hair
about
it
stained
ruddily
and
the
still
open
eyes
upturned
as
though
in
dumb
appeal
to
heaven
then
without
deigning
to
utter
another
word
or
to
bestow
another
look
upon
the
surrounding
crowd
of
his
disconcerted
subjects
he
gathered
up
his
coursers
reins
and
prepared
to
depart
just
then
the
sun
went
behind
a
cloud
and
only
a
of
radiance
shot
forth
pouring
itself
straight
down
on
the
royally
attired
figure
of
the
monarch
and
the
headless
body
of
khosrul
and
at
the
same
time
bringing
into
sudden
and
prominent
relief
the
silver
cross
that
glittered
on
the
breast
of
the
bleeding
corpse
and
that
seemed
to
mysteriously
offer
itself
as
the
key
to
some
unsolved
enigma
as
if
drawn
by
one
strangely
mutual
attraction
all
eyes
even
those
of
zephoranim
himself
turned
instinctively
toward
the
flashing
emblem
which
appeared
to
burn
like
living
fire
on
that
perished
mass
of
stiffening
clay
and
there
was
a
brief
silence
a
pause
during
which
theos
who
had
watched
everything
with
curiously
calm
interest
such
as
may
be
felt
by
a
spectator
watching
the
progress
of
a
finely
acted
tragedy
became
conscious
of
the
same
singular
sensation
he
had
already
several
times
experienced
namely
that
he
had
witnessed
the
whole
of
this
scene
before
he
remembered
it
quite
well
particularly
that
apparently
trifling
incident
of
the
sunlight
happening
to
shine
so
brilliantly
on
the
dead
man
and
his
cross
while
the
rest
of
the
vast
assemblage
were
in
comparative
shadow
it
was
very
odd
his
memory
was
like
a
wonderful
in
which
some
pictures
were
fresh
of
tint
while
others
were
dim
and
faded
but
this
special
tableau
in
the
square
of
was
very
distinctly
painted
in
brilliant
and
vivid
colors
on
the
sombre
background
of
his
past
recollections
and
he
found
the
circumstance
so
remarkable
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
to
about
it
when
the
sun
came
out
again
in
full
splendor
and
zephoranim
spirited
steeds
started
forward
at
a
canter
the
king
controlling
them
easily
with
one
hand
extended
the
other
majestically
by
way
of
formal
salutation
to
his
people
his
tall
muscular
form
was
displayed
to
the
best
advantage
the
narrow
jewelled
fillet
that
bound
his
rough
dark
locks
emitted
a
myriad
scintillations
of
light
his
woven
from
thousands
of
small
links
of
gold
set
off
his
massive
chest
and
shoulders
to
perfection
and
as
he
moved
along
royally
in
his
sumptuous
car
the
effect
of
his
striking
presence
was
such
that
a
complete
change
took
place
in
the
before
sullen
humor
of
the
populace
for
seeing
him
thus
alive
and
well
in
direct
opposition
to
khosrul
ominous
prediction
even
as
also
stood
unharmed
in
spite
of
his
having
been
apostrophized
as
a
dying
poet
the
mob
always
fickle
and
always
dazzled
by
outward
show
suddenly
set
up
a
deafening
roar
of
cheering
the
pallid
hue
of
terror
vanished
from
faces
that
had
but
lately
looked
spectrally
thin
with
speechless
dread
and
crowds
of
servile
petitioners
and
began
to
press
eagerly
round
their
monarch
chariot
when
all
at
once
a
woman
in
the
throng
gave
a
wild
scream
and
rushed
away
shrieking
the
obelisk
the
obelisk
every
eye
was
instantly
turned
toward
the
stately
pillar
of
white
granite
that
sparkled
in
the
sunlight
like
an
immense
carven
jewel
great
heaven
it
was
tottering
to
and
fro
like
the
unsteadied
mast
of
a
ship
at
sea
one
look
sufficed
and
a
frightful
panic
ensued
a
horrible
brutish
stampede
of
creatures
without
faith
in
anything
human
or
divine
save
their
own
wretched
personalities
the
king
infected
by
the
general
scare
urged
his
horses
into
furious
gallop
and
dashed
through
the
cursing
swearing
howling
throng
like
an
embodied
whirlwind
and
for
a
few
seconds
nothing
seemed
distinctly
visible
but
a
surging
mass
of
infuriated
humanity
fighting
with
itself
for
life
theos
alone
remained
singularly
calm
his
sole
consideration
was
for
his
friend
whom
he
entwined
with
one
arm
as
he
sprang
down
from
the
position
they
had
hitherto
occupied
on
the
brink
of
the
fountain
and
made
straight
for
the
nearest
of
the
six
broad
avenues
that
opened
directly
into
the
square
looked
pale
but
was
apparently
unafraid
he
said
nothing
and
passively
allowed
himself
to
be
piloted
by
theos
through
the
madly
raging
multitude
which
oddly
enough
parted
before
them
like
mist
before
the
wind
so
that
in
a
magically
short
interval
they
successfully
reached
a
place
of
safety
and
they
reached
it
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
the
obelisk
was
now
plainly
to
be
seen
lurching
forward
at
an
angle
of
several
degrees
strange
muffled
roaring
sounds
were
heard
at
its
base
as
though
demons
were
digging
up
its
foundations
then
seemingly
shaken
by
underground
tremors
it
began
to
oscillate
violently
a
terrific
explosion
was
heard
as
of
the
bursting
of
a
giant
bomb
and
immediately
afterward
the
majestic
monolith
toppled
over
and
fell
with
the
crash
of
a
colossal
cannonade
that
sent
its
thunderous
reverberations
through
and
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
city
hundreds
of
persons
were
killed
and
wounded
many
of
the
mounted
guards
and
spearmen
who
were
striving
to
force
a
way
of
escape
through
the
crowd
were
struck
down
and
crushed
with
their
horses
as
they
rode
the
desperate
people
trampled
each
other
to
death
in
their
frenzied
efforts
to
reach
the
nearest
outlet
to
the
river
embankment
but
when
once
the
obelisk
had
actually
fallen
all
this
turmoil
was
for
an
instant
checked
and
the
gasping
torn
and
bleeding
survivors
of
the
struggle
stopped
as
it
were
to
take
breath
and
stared
in
blank
dismay
upon
the
strange
ruin
before
them
theos
still
holding
by
the
arm
with
the
protecting
fondness
of
an
elder
brother
guarding
a
younger
gazed
also
at
the
scene
with
quiet
sorrowfully
wondering
eyes
for
it
meant
something
to
him
he
was
sure
because
it
was
so
familiar
yet
he
found
it
impossible
to
grasp
the
comprehension
of
that
meaning
it
was
a
singular
spectacle
enough
the
lofty
white
pillar
that
had
so
lately
been
a
monumental
glory
of
had
split
itself
with
the
violence
of
its
fall
into
two
huge
fragments
which
now
lay
one
on
each
side
of
the
square
as
though
flung
thither
by
a
titan
hand
the
great
lion
had
been
hurled
from
its
position
and
overturned
like
a
toy
while
the
shield
it
had
supported
between
its
paws
had
entirely
disappeared
in
minutely
scattered
atoms
the
fountains
had
altogether
ceased
playing
now
and
then
a
thin
vaporous
stream
of
smoke
appeared
to
issue
between
the
crannies
of
the
pavement
otherwise
there
was
no
visible
sign
of
the
mysterious
force
that
had
wrought
so
swift
and
sudden
a
work
of
destruction
the
sun
shone
brilliantly
and
over
all
the
havoc
beamed
the
placid
brightness
of
a
cloudless
summer
sky
the
most
prominent
object
of
all
amid
the
general
devastation
and
the
one
that
fascinated
theos
more
than
the
view
of
the
destroyed
monolith
and
the
debased
lion
was
the
uninjured
head
of
the
prophet
khosrul
there
it
lay
exactly
between
the
sundered
halves
of
the
obelisk
pale
rays
of
light
glimmered
on
its
bloodstained
silvery
hair
and
open
glazed
eyes
a
solemn
smile
seemed
graven
on
its
features
and
at
a
little
distance
off
on
the
breast
of
the
headless
corpse
that
remained
totally
uncrushed
in
an
open
space
by
itself
among
the
surrounding
heaps
of
slain
and
wounded
glistened
the
cross
like
a
fiery
gem
an
talisman
that
as
he
beheld
it
filled
theos
heart
with
a
feverish
craving
an
inexplicable
desire
mingled
with
remorse
far
greater
than
any
fear
instinctively
he
drew
away
away
still
keeping
his
wistful
gaze
fixed
on
that
uncomprehended
yet
symbol
till
gradually
the
drooping
branches
of
trees
interrupted
and
shadowed
the
vista
and
as
he
moved
further
and
further
backward
closed
their
soft
network
of
green
foliage
like
the
closing
curtain
on
the
strange
but
awfully
remembered
scene
shutting
it
out
from
his
bewildered
forever
chapter
xxv
a
golden
tress
once
clear
of
the
square
the
two
friends
apparently
became
mutually
conscious
of
the
peril
they
had
just
escaped
and
coming
to
a
sudden
standstill
they
looked
at
each
other
in
blank
stupefied
silence
crowds
of
people
streamed
past
them
wandering
hither
and
thither
in
confused
cloudy
masses
some
with
groans
and
dire
lamentations
bearing
away
their
dead
and
wounded
others
rushing
frantically
about
beating
their
breasts
tearing
their
hair
calling
on
the
gods
and
lamenting
khosrul
while
not
a
few
muttered
curses
on
the
king
and
ever
and
anon
the
name
of
lysia
coupled
with
heavy
execrations
was
hissed
from
mouth
to
mouth
which
theos
overhearing
began
to
foresee
might
serve
as
a
likely
cause
for
taking
offence
and
possibly
resenting
in
his
own
person
this
public
disparagement
of
the
woman
he
loved
therefore
without
more
ado
he
roused
himself
from
his
momentarily
dazed
condition
and
urged
his
comrade
on
at
a
quick
pace
toward
the
safe
shelter
of
his
own
palace
where
at
any
rate
he
could
be
kept
out
of
the
reach
of
immediate
harm
the
twain
walked
side
by
side
exchanging
scarcely
a
word
seemed
in
a
manner
stunned
by
the
violence
of
the
late
catastrophe
and
theos
was
too
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
to
speak
on
their
way
they
were
overtaken
by
the
king
chariot
it
flew
by
with
a
glittering
whirl
and
clatter
amid
sweeping
clouds
of
dust
through
which
the
dark
face
of
zephoranim
loomed
out
upon
them
like
an
almost
palpable
shadow
as
it
vanished
stopped
short
and
stared
at
his
companion
in
utter
amazement
by
my
soul
he
exclaimed
the
whole
world
must
be
going
mad
is
the
first
time
in
all
my
days
of
laureateship
that
zephoranim
hath
failed
to
reverently
salute
me
as
he
passed
and
he
looked
far
more
perturbed
than
when
the
falling
obelisk
had
threatened
him
with
imminent
destruction
theos
caught
his
arm
with
a
quick
movement
of
vexed
impatience
tush
man
no
matter
he
said
hastily
what
are
kings
to
thee
thou
who
art
an
emperor
of
song
these
little
potentates
that
wield
earth
sceptres
are
as
fickle
in
their
moods
as
the
very
mob
they
are
supposed
to
govern
moreover
thou
knowest
zephoranim
hath
had
enough
to
startle
him
out
of
all
accustomed
rules
of
courtesy
be
assured
of
it
his
mind
is
like
a
ship
at
sea
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds
thou
canst
not
surely
blame
him
that
for
once
after
so
strange
a
turbulence
and
unwonted
a
disaster
he
hath
no
eyes
for
thee
whose
sole
sweet
mission
is
to
minister
to
pleasure
to
minister
to
pleasure
echoed
nay
have
i
done
nothing
more
than
this
art
thou
already
grown
so
disloyal
a
friend
that
thou
wilt
half
repeat
the
jargon
of
yon
dead
fanatic
khosrul
who
dared
to
tell
me
i
had
served
my
art
unfittingly
have
i
not
ministered
to
grief
as
well
as
joy
to
hours
of
pain
and
bitterness
as
well
as
to
long
days
of
ease
and
amorous
dreaming
have
i
not
here
he
paused
and
a
warm
flush
crept
through
the
olive
pallor
of
his
skin
his
eyes
grew
plaintive
and
wistful
and
he
threw
one
arm
round
theos
neck
as
he
continued
no
after
all
is
vain
to
deny
it
i
have
hated
grief
i
have
loathed
the
very
suggestion
of
care
i
have
thrust
sorrow
out
of
my
sight
as
a
thing
vile
and
unwelcome
and
i
have
chosen
to
sing
to
the
world
of
rapture
more
than
pain
inasmuch
as
methinks
humanity
suffers
enough
without
having
its
cureless
anguish
set
to
the
music
of
a
poet
rhythm
to
incessantly
haunt
and
torture
its
already
breaking
heart
say
rather
to
soothe
and
tranquillize
murmured
theos
more
to
himself
than
to
his
friend
for
suppressed
sorrow
is
hardest
to
endure
and
when
grief
once
finds
apt
utterance
is
already
half
consoled
so
should
the
world
great
singers
tenderly
proclaim
the
world
most
speechless
miseries
and
who
knows
but
vexed
creation
being
thus
relieved
of
woe
may
not
take
new
heart
of
grace
and
comfort
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
soft
and
seemed
not
to
hear
he
leaned
however
very
confidingly
and
affectionately
against
theos
shoulder
as
he
walked
along
and
appeared
to
have
speedily
forgotten
his
annoyance
at
the
recent
slighting
conduct
of
the
king
i
marvel
at
the
downfall
of
the
obelisk
he
said
presently
was
rooted
full
ten
feet
deep
in
solid
earth
maybe
the
foundations
were
nevertheless
if
history
speaks
truly
it
hath
stood
unshaken
for
two
thousand
years
strange
that
it
should
be
now
hurled
forth
thus
desperately
i
would
i
knew
the
hidden
cause
many
alas
have
met
their
death
pushed
out
of
life
in
haste
all
one
wonders
where
such
souls
have
fled
something
there
is
that
troubles
me
methinks
i
am
more
than
half
disposed
to
leave
for
a
time
and
wander
forth
into
a
world
of
unknown
things
with
me
cried
theos
impetuously
come
with
me
come
now
this
very
day
i
too
have
been
warned
of
evil
undeclared
yet
close
at
hand
us
escape
from
danger
while
time
remains
let
us
depart
whither
should
we
go
and
pausing
in
his
walk
fixed
his
large
soft
eyes
full
on
his
companion
as
he
put
the
question
theos
was
mute
covered
with
confusion
he
asked
himself
the
same
thing
whither
should
we
go
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
country
that
lay
outside
he
had
no
distinct
remembrance
of
any
other
place
than
this
in
which
he
was
all
his
past
existence
was
as
blotted
and
blurred
as
a
child
spoiled
and
discarded
copybook
true
he
retained
two
names
in
his
thoughts
namely
ardath
and
the
pass
of
dariel
but
he
was
hopelessly
ignorant
as
to
what
these
meant
or
how
he
had
become
connected
with
them
he
was
roused
from
his
distressful
cogitation
by
voice
speaking
again
half
gayly
half
sadly
nay
nay
my
friend
we
can
not
leave
the
city
we
two
alone
and
unguided
for
beyond
the
gates
is
the
desert
wide
and
bare
with
scarce
a
spring
of
cool
water
in
many
weary
miles
and
beyond
the
desert
is
a
forest
gloomy
and
tiger
haunted
wherein
the
footsteps
of
man
have
seldom
penetrated
to
travel
thus
far
we
should
need
much
preparation
many
servants
many
beasts
of
burden
and
many
months
moreover
is
a
foolish
fancy
crossed
my
mind
at
best
for
what
should
i
the
laureate
of
do
in
other
lands
besides
my
departure
would
indeed
be
the
desolation
of
the
city
well
may
fall
when
no
longer
abides
within
it
seawards
the
way
lies
open
maybe
in
days
to
come
we
twain
may
take
ship
and
sail
hence
for
a
brief
sojourn
to
those
distant
western
shores
whence
thou
though
thou
sayest
naught
of
them
must
assuredly
have
come
i
have
often
dreamed
idly
of
a
gray
coast
washed
with
dull
rain
and
swathed
in
sweeping
mists
where
ever
and
anon
the
sun
shines
through
a
country
cheerless
where
a
poet
fame
like
mine
might
ring
the
darkness
of
the
skies
with
light
and
stir
the
sleepy
silence
into
song
still
theos
said
nothing
there
were
hot
tears
in
his
throat
that
choked
his
utterance
he
gazed
up
at
the
glowing
sky
above
him
it
was
a
burning
vault
of
cloudless
blue
in
which
the
sun
glared
forth
witheringly
like
a
scorching
mass
of
flame
oh
for
the
freshness
of
a
gray
coast
washed
with
dull
rain
and
swathed
in
sweeping
mists
such
as
spoke
of
and
what
a
strange
sickening
yearning
suddenly
filled
his
soul
for
the
unforgotten
sonorous
dash
of
the
sea
he
drew
a
quick
breath
and
pressed
his
friend
arm
with
unconscious
fervor
why
why
could
he
not
take
this
dear
companion
away
out
of
possible
peril
away
to
those
far
lands
dimly
remembered
yet
now
so
completely
lost
sight
of
that
they
seemed
to
him
but
as
a
delusive
mirage
faintly
discerned
above
the
rising
waters
of
lethe
sighing
deeply
he
controlled
his
emotion
and
forced
himself
to
speak
calmly
though
his
voice
not
now
then
but
hereafter
be
my
be
a
joyous
time
when
we
set
free
of
present
hindrance
may
journey
through
a
myriad
glorious
scenes
together
sharing
such
new
and
mutual
gladness
that
perchance
we
scarce
shall
miss
the
splendor
of
left
behind
meanwhile
i
would
that
thou
couldst
promise
me
one
thing
here
he
paused
but
seeing
inquiring
look
went
on
in
a
low
eager
tone
go
not
to
the
temple
absent
thyself
from
this
sacrifice
which
though
it
be
the
law
of
the
realm
is
nevertheless
mere
murderous
barbarity
and
inasmuch
as
the
king
is
wrathful
i
pray
thee
avoid
his
presence
broke
into
a
now
by
my
faith
good
comrade
as
well
ask
me
for
my
head
as
demand
such
impossibilities
absent
myself
from
the
temple
of
all
nights
in
the
world
when
owing
to
these
late
phenomenal
occurrences
in
the
city
every
one
who
is
of
repute
and
personal
distinction
will
be
present
to
assist
at
the
service
and
offer
petitions
to
the
fabulous
gods
that
haply
their
supposititious
indignation
may
be
averted
my
friend
if
only
for
the
sake
of
custom
i
must
be
there
moreover
i
should
be
liable
to
banishment
from
the
realm
for
so
specially
marked
a
breach
of
religious
discipline
and
as
for
the
king
he
is
my
puppet
were
he
savage
as
a
starving
bear
my
voice
could
tame
him
and
concerning
his
late
churlishness
was
no
doubt
mere
heat
of
humor
and
thou
shalt
see
him
sue
to
me
for
pardon
as
only
monarchs
can
sue
to
the
bards
who
keep
them
in
their
thrones
knowest
thou
not
that
were
i
to
string
three
stanzas
of
a
fiery
republican
ditty
and
set
it
floating
on
the
lips
of
the
people
that
song
would
sing
down
zephoranim
from
his
royal
estate
more
surely
than
the
fury
of
an
armed
conqueror
believe
it
we
the
poets
rule
the
nation
a
rhyme
has
oft
had
power
to
kill
a
king
theos
smiled
at
the
proud
boast
but
made
no
reply
as
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
laureate
palace
and
were
ascending
the
steps
that
led
into
the
a
young
page
advanced
to
meet
them
and
dropping
on
one
knee
before
his
master
held
out
a
small
scroll
tied
across
and
across
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
thick
strand
of
floss
silk
for
the
most
illustrious
chief
of
poets
said
the
little
lad
keeping
his
head
bent
humbly
as
he
spoke
it
was
brought
lately
by
one
masked
who
rode
in
haste
and
fear
and
ere
he
could
be
questioned
swift
departed
took
the
missive
carelessly
scarcely
glancing
at
it
and
crossed
the
hall
toward
his
own
apartment
theos
following
him
on
his
way
however
he
paused
and
turned
round
has
niphrata
yet
come
home
he
demanded
of
the
page
who
still
lingered
no
my
lord
naught
hath
been
seen
or
heard
concerning
her
gave
a
petulant
gesture
of
annoyance
and
passed
on
arrived
in
his
study
he
seated
himself
and
allowed
his
eyes
to
rest
more
attentively
on
the
packet
just
given
him
as
he
looked
he
uttered
a
slight
exclamation
theos
hastened
to
his
side
what
has
happened
hast
thou
ill
news
ill
news
nay
of
a
truth
i
know
not
and
the
laureate
gazed
up
blankly
into
his
friend
but
this
and
he
touched
the
fair
silken
substance
that
tied
the
scroll
he
held
this
is
hair
niphrata
hair
theos
was
too
much
surprised
to
do
more
than
repeat
the
words
mechanically
while
a
strange
pang
shot
through
his
heart
as
of
inward
shame
or
sorrow
naught
can
deceive
me
in
the
color
of
that
gold
went
on
dreamily
as
with
careful
somewhat
tremulous
fingers
he
gently
loosened
the
twisted
shining
threads
that
were
so
delicately
knotted
together
and
smoothing
them
out
to
their
full
length
displayed
what
was
indeed
a
lovely
tress
of
hair
bright
as
woven
sunlight
with
a
rippling
wave
in
it
that
like
the
tendril
of
a
vine
caught
and
wound
about
his
hand
as
though
it
were
a
fond
and
feeling
thing
see
you
not
theos
how
warm
and
soft
and
shuddering
a
curl
it
is
it
clings
to
me
as
if
it
knew
my
touch
as
if
it
half
remembered
how
many
and
many
a
time
it
had
been
drawn
with
its
companions
to
my
lips
and
kissed
full
tenderly
how
sad
and
desolate
it
seems
thus
severed
and
alone
he
spoke
gently
yet
not
without
a
touch
of
passion
and
twined
the
fair
tresses
lingeringly
round
his
fingers
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
instinctively
prepared
for
some
unpleasing
tidings
he
opened
the
scroll
and
perused
its
contents
in
silence
as
he
read
on
his
face
grew
very
grave
and
full
of
pained
and
wondering
quietly
he
passed
the
missive
to
theos
who
took
it
from
his
hand
with
a
tremor
of
something
like
fear
the
delicately
traced
characters
with
which
it
was
covered
floated
for
a
moment
in
a
faint
blur
before
his
eyes
then
they
resolved
themselves
into
legible
shape
and
meaning
as
follows
to
the
and
immortally
renowned
of
the
kingdom
of
blame
me
not
o
my
beloved
lord
that
i
have
left
thy
dearest
presence
thus
unwarnedly
forever
staying
no
time
to
weary
thee
with
my
too
fond
and
foolish
tears
and
kisses
of
farewell
i
owe
to
thee
the
gift
of
freedom
and
while
i
thank
thee
for
that
gift
i
do
employ
it
now
to
serve
me
as
a
sacrifice
to
love
an
immolation
of
myself
upon
the
altars
of
my
own
desire
for
thou
knowest
i
have
loved
thee
o
not
too
well
but
most
unwisely
for
what
am
i
that
thou
shouldst
stoop
to
cover
my
unworthiness
with
the
royal
purple
of
thy
what
could
i
ever
be
save
the
poor
trembling
of
whose
endearments
thou
must
needs
most
speedily
tire
nevertheless
i
can
not
still
this
hunger
of
my
heart
this
love
that
stings
me
more
than
it
consoles
and
out
of
the
very
transport
of
my
burning
thoughts
i
have
learned
many
and
strange
things
things
whereby
i
a
woman
feebled
and
unlessoned
have
grasped
the
glimmering
foreknowledge
of
events
to
come
events
wherein
i
do
perceive
for
thee
thou
chiefest
among
men
some
dark
and
threatening
disaster
when
fore
i
have
prayed
unto
the
most
high
gods
that
they
will
deign
to
accept
me
as
thy
hostage
to
misfortune
and
set
me
as
a
bar
between
thy
life
and
dawning
peril
so
that
i
long
valueless
may
serve
at
least
awhile
to
avert
doom
from
thee
who
art
unparagoned
throughout
the
world
thus
i
go
forth
alone
to
brave
and
pacify
the
wrath
of
the
immortals
call
me
not
back
nor
weep
for
my
departure
thou
wilt
not
miss
me
long
to
die
for
thee
is
better
than
to
live
for
thee
for
living
i
must
needs
be
conquered
by
my
sin
of
love
and
lose
myself
and
thee
but
in
the
quiet
afterwards
of
death
no
passion
shall
have
strength
to
mar
the
peaceful
patient
waiting
of
my
soul
on
thine
farewell
thou
utmost
heart
of
my
weak
heart
only
life
of
my
frail
life
think
of
me
sometimes
if
thou
will
but
only
as
of
a
flower
thou
didst
gather
once
in
some
past
a
flower
that
as
it
slowly
withered
blessed
the
dear
hand
in
whose
warm
clasp
it
died
niphrata
tears
rose
to
theos
eyes
as
he
finished
reading
these
evidently
unpremeditated
pathetic
words
that
suggested
so
much
more
than
they
actually
declared
he
silently
returned
the
scroll
to
who
sat
very
still
thoughtfully
stroking
the
long
bright
curl
that
was
twisted
round
his
fingers
like
a
glittering
strand
of
spun
glass
and
he
felt
all
at
once
so
unreasonably
irritated
with
his
friend
that
he
was
even
inclined
to
find
fault
with
the
very
grace
and
beauty
of
his
person
the
mere
indolence
of
his
attitude
was
for
the
moment
provoking
why
art
thou
so
unmoved
he
demanded
almost
sternly
what
hast
thou
done
to
niphrata
to
thus
grieve
her
gentle
spirit
beyond
remedy
looked
up
like
a
surprised
child
done
nay
what
should
i
do
i
have
let
her
love
me
o
sublime
permission
he
had
let
her
love
him
he
had
condescendingly
allowed
her
as
it
were
to
waste
all
the
treasures
of
her
soul
upon
him
theos
stared
at
him
in
vague
amazement
while
he
apparently
tired
of
his
own
reflections
continued
with
some
impatience
what
more
could
she
desire
i
never
barred
her
from
my
presence
nor
checked
the
fervor
of
her
greetings
i
wore
the
flowers
she
chose
i
listened
to
the
songs
she
sang
and
when
she
looked
more
fair
than
ordinary
i
stinted
not
the
warmth
of
my
caresses
she
was
too
meek
and
loving
for
my
fancy
no
will
save
mine
no
happiness
save
in
my
company
no
thought
beyond
my
pleasure
one
wearies
of
such
a
fond
excess
of
sweetness
nevertheless
her
sole
delight
was
still
to
serve
me
could
i
debar
her
from
that
joy
because
i
saw
therein
some
danger
for
her
peace
slave
as
she
was
i
made
her
free
and
lo
how
capriciously
she
plays
with
her
liberty
is
always
the
way
with
women
no
man
shall
ever
learn
how
best
to
please
them
she
knew
i
loved
her
not
as
lovers
love
she
knew
my
heart
was
elsewhere
fixed
and
fated
and
if
notwithstanding
this
knowledge
she
still
chose
to
love
me
then
assuredly
her
grief
is
of
her
own
creating
methinks
i
who
am
most
injured
in
this
matter
all
the
day
long
i
have
tormented
myself
concerning
the
silly
maiden
absence
while
she
seized
by
some
crazed
idea
of
new
adventure
has
gone
forth
heedlessly
scarce
knowing
whither
her
letter
is
the
exalted
utterance
of
an
overwrought
excited
brain
she
has
in
all
likelihood
caught
the
contagion
of
superstitious
alarm
that
seems
just
now
to
possess
the
whole
city
and
she
knows
naught
of
what
she
writes
or
what
she
means
to
do
to
leave
me
forever
as
she
says
is
out
of
her
power
for
i
will
demand
her
back
at
the
hands
of
lysia
or
the
king
and
no
demand
of
mine
has
ever
been
refused
moreover
with
lysia
aid
her
is
soon
and
easily
discovered
how
asked
theos
mechanically
still
surveying
the
beautiful
calm
features
of
the
charming
egotist
whose
nature
seemed
such
a
curious
mixture
of
loftiness
and
she
may
have
left
the
city
no
one
can
leave
the
city
without
express
permission
rejoined
tranquilly
besides
didst
thou
not
see
the
black
disc
last
night
in
lysia
palace
theos
nodded
assent
he
at
once
remembered
the
strange
revolving
thing
that
had
covered
itself
with
brilliant
letters
at
the
approach
of
the
high
priestess
and
he
waited
somewhat
eagerly
to
hear
the
meaning
of
so
singular
an
object
explained
the
priest
of
the
temple
of
nagaya
went
on
are
the
greatest
scientists
in
the
world
with
the
exception
of
the
lately
formed
circle
of
mystics
who
it
must
be
confessed
exceed
them
in
certain
new
lines
of
discovery
but
setting
aside
the
mystic
school
which
it
behoves
us
not
to
speak
of
seeing
it
is
condemned
by
law
there
are
no
men
living
more
subtly
wise
in
matters
pertaining
to
aerial
force
and
than
the
servants
of
the
secret
doctrine
of
the
temple
all
things
are
to
them
mere
child
play
and
the
miracles
by
which
they
keep
the
multitude
in
awe
are
not
by
any
means
vulgar
but
most
exquisitely
scientific
as
for
instance
at
the
great
new
year
festival
called
by
us
of
the
ship
of
the
sun
which
takes
place
at
the
commencement
of
the
spring
solstice
a
fire
is
kindled
on
the
summit
of
the
highest
tower
and
a
ship
of
gold
rises
from
the
centre
of
the
flames
carrying
the
body
of
a
slain
virgin
eastwards
is
wondrously
performed
and
i
like
others
have
gaped
upon
the
splendor
of
the
scene
and
wholly
dazzled
for
the
ship
doth
rise
aloft
with
excellent
stateliness
plowing
the
air
with
as
much
celerity
as
plow
the
seas
departing
straightway
from
the
watching
eyes
of
thousands
of
spectators
it
plunges
deep
or
so
it
seems
into
the
very
heart
of
the
rising
sun
which
doth
apparently
absorb
it
in
devouring
flames
of
glory
for
never
again
doth
it
return
to
earth
and
none
can
solve
the
mystery
of
its
vanishing
is
a
graceful
piece
of
jugglery
and
perfectly
accomplished
while
as
for
oracles
footnote
the
phonograph
was
known
and
used
for
the
utterance
of
oracles
by
one
savan
the
asmounian
a
of
ancient
egypt
that
command
and
repeat
their
commands
in
every
shade
of
tone
from
mild
to
wrathful
there
are
only
too
many
of
these
moreover
the
secret
of
their
manufacture
is
well
known
to
all
students
of
acoustic
science
but
concerning
the
black
disc
in
lysia
hall
it
is
a
curiously
elaborate
piece
of
workmanship
it
corresponds
with
an
electric
wheel
in
the
interior
chamber
of
the
temple
where
all
the
priests
and
flamens
meet
and
sum
up
the
entire
events
of
the
day
both
public
and
private
condensing
the
same
into
brief
hieroglyphs
setting
their
wheel
in
motion
they
start
a
similar
motion
in
the
disc
and
the
bright
characters
that
flash
upon
it
and
disappear
like
quicksilver
are
the
reflection
of
the
working
electric
wires
which
write
what
only
lysia
is
skilled
to
read
from
sunset
to
midnight
these
messages
keep
coming
without
intermission
and
all
the
most
carefully
concealed
affairs
of
are
discovered
by
the
temple
spies
and
conveyed
to
lysia
by
this
means
whatever
the
news
it
is
repeated
again
and
again
on
the
disc
till
she
by
rapidly
turning
it
with
a
peculiar
movement
of
her
own
causes
a
small
bell
to
ring
in
the
temple
which
signifies
to
her
informers
that
she
has
understood
all
their
communications
and
knows
everything
her
inquisitorial
system
is
searching
and
elaborate
there
is
no
secret
so
carefully
guarded
that
the
black
disc
will
not
in
time
reveal
theos
listened
wonderingly
and
with
a
sense
of
repugnance
and
fear
he
felt
as
though
the
beautiful
priestess
with
her
glittering
robes
and
the
dreadful
jewelled
eye
upon
her
breast
were
just
then
entering
the
room
stealthily
and
rustling
hither
and
thither
like
a
snake
beneath
covering
leaves
she
was
an
temptation
a
bewildering
snare
and
distracting
evil
was
it
not
possible
to
shake
her
trail
off
the
life
of
his
also
to
pluck
from
out
his
own
heart
the
of
her
fatal
terrible
fascination
a
red
mist
swam
before
his
eyes
his
lips
were
dry
and
feverish
his
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
faint
in
his
own
ears
when
he
forced
himself
to
speak
again
so
thou
dost
think
that
wheresoever
niphrata
hath
strayed
lysia
can
find
her
he
said
assuredly
returned
with
easy
complacency
i
would
swear
that
even
at
this
very
moment
lysia
could
restore
her
to
my
arms
in
safety
then
why
suggested
theos
anxiously
why
not
go
forth
and
seek
her
now
nay
there
is
time
and
half
closed
his
languid
lids
and
stretched
himself
lazily
i
would
not
have
the
child
imagine
i
vexed
myself
too
greatly
for
her
unkind
departure
she
must
have
space
wherein
to
weep
and
repent
her
of
her
folly
she
is
the
strangest
maiden
and
he
brushed
his
lips
lightly
against
the
golden
curl
he
held
she
loves
me
and
yet
repulses
all
attempted
passion
i
remember
here
his
face
grew
more
serious
i
remember
one
night
in
the
beginning
of
summer
the
moon
was
round
and
high
in
heaven
we
were
alone
together
in
this
room
the
lamps
burned
low
and
niphrata
sang
to
me
her
voice
was
full
and
withal
tremulous
her
form
bent
to
her
ebony
harp
was
soft
and
yielding
as
an
iris
stem
her
eyes
turned
upon
mine
seemed
wonderingly
to
question
me
as
to
the
worth
of
love
or
so
i
fancied
the
worth
of
love
i
would
have
taught
it
to
her
then
in
the
rapture
of
an
hour
but
seized
with
sudden
foolish
fear
she
fled
leaving
me
dissatisfied
indifferent
and
weary
no
matter
when
she
returns
again
her
mood
will
alter
and
though
i
love
her
not
as
she
would
fain
be
loved
i
shall
find
means
to
make
her
happy
nay
but
she
speaks
of
dying
said
theos
quickly
wilt
thou
constrain
her
back
from
death
my
friend
all
women
speak
of
dying
when
they
are
replied
with
a
slight
smile
niphrata
will
not
die
she
is
too
young
and
fond
of
life
the
world
is
as
a
garden
wherein
she
has
but
lately
entered
all
ignorant
of
the
pleasures
that
await
her
there
is
an
odd
notion
that
she
has
of
danger
threatening
me
thou
also
good
theos
art
become
full
of
omens
and
yet
there
is
naught
of
visible
ill
to
trouble
the
fairness
of
the
day
he
stepped
out
as
he
spoke
on
the
terrace
and
looked
up
at
the
intense
calm
of
the
lovely
sky
theos
followed
him
and
stood
leaning
on
the
balustrade
among
the
clambering
vines
watching
him
with
earnest
eyes
he
meanwhile
gathered
a
scarcely
opened
white
rosebud
and
loosening
the
tress
of
niphrata
hair
from
his
fingers
allowed
it
to
hang
to
its
full
rippling
length
then
laying
the
flower
against
it
he
appeared
dreamily
to
admire
the
contrast
between
the
snowy
blossom
and
shining
curl
many
strange
men
there
are
in
the
world
he
said
softly
lovers
and
fools
who
set
priceless
store
on
a
rose
and
a
lock
of
woman
hair
i
have
heard
of
some
who
dying
have
held
such
trifles
as
chiefest
of
all
their
worldly
goods
and
have
implored
that
whereas
their
gold
and
household
stuff
can
be
bestowed
freely
on
him
who
first
comes
to
claim
it
the
faded
flower
and
senseless
tress
may
be
laid
on
their
hearts
to
comfort
them
in
the
cold
and
dreamless
sleep
from
which
they
shall
not
wake
again
he
sighed
and
his
eyes
darkened
into
deep
and
musing
tenderness
poets
there
have
been
too
and
are
who
would
string
many
a
canticle
on
this
soft
severed
lock
and
gathered
blossom
and
many
a
quaint
conceit
could
i
myself
contrive
concerning
it
did
i
not
feel
more
prone
to
tears
than
minstrelsy
canst
thou
believe
it
theos
and
he
forced
a
laugh
though
his
lashes
were
wet
i
the
joyous
am
for
once
most
truly
sad
this
tress
of
hair
doth
seem
to
catch
my
spirit
in
a
chain
that
binds
me
fast
and
draws
me
to
some
mournful
end
i
may
not
dare
to
see
and
as
he
spoke
he
mechanically
wound
the
golden
curl
round
and
about
the
stem
of
the
rosebud
in
the
fashion
of
a
ribbon
and
placed
the
two
entwined
together
in
his
breast
theos
looked
at
him
wistfully
but
was
silent
he
himself
was
too
full
of
dull
and
melancholy
misgivings
to
be
otherwise
than
sad
also
instinctively
he
drew
closer
to
his
friend
side
and
thus
they
remained
for
some
minutes
exchanging
no
words
and
gazing
dreamily
out
on
the
luxurious
foliage
of
the
trees
and
the
wealth
of
bright
blossoms
that
adorned
the
landscape
before
them
thou
art
confident
niphrata
will
return
questioned
theos
presently
in
a
low
tone
she
will
return
rejoined
quietly
because
she
will
do
anything
for
love
of
me
for
love
sake
she
may
die
said
theos
smiled
not
so
my
friend
for
love
sake
she
will
live
chapter
xxvi
the
priest
zel
as
he
uttered
the
last
word
the
sound
of
an
approaching
light
step
disturbed
the
silence
it
was
one
of
the
young
girls
of
the
household
a
dark
beauty
whom
theos
remembered
to
have
seen
in
the
when
he
first
arrived
lying
indolently
among
cushions
and
playing
with
a
tame
bird
which
flew
to
and
fro
at
her
beckoning
she
advanced
now
with
an
almost
imperial
stateliness
her
salute
to
was
grateful
yet
scarcely
submissive
while
he
turning
eagerly
toward
her
seemed
gladdened
and
relieved
at
her
appearance
his
face
assuming
a
gratified
expression
like
that
of
a
child
who
having
broken
one
toy
is
easily
consoled
with
another
welcome
irenya
he
exclaimed
gayly
thou
art
the
very
i
desire
thy
naughty
pout
and
coldly
mutinous
eyes
are
pleasing
contrasts
to
the
overlanguid
heat
and
brightness
of
the
day
what
news
hast
thou
my
sweet
is
there
fresh
havoc
in
the
city
more
deaths
more
troublous
tidings
nay
then
hold
thy
peace
for
thou
art
not
a
fit
messenger
of
woe
much
too
fair
irenya
red
lips
curled
disdainfully
the
naughty
pout
was
plainly
visible
my
lord
is
pleased
to
flatter
his
slave
she
said
with
a
touch
of
scorn
in
her
musical
accents
certes
of
ill
news
there
is
more
than
enough
and
evil
rumors
have
never
been
lacking
these
many
months
as
my
lord
would
have
known
had
he
deigned
to
listen
to
the
common
talk
of
those
who
are
not
poets
but
merely
sad
and
suffering
men
nevertheless
though
i
may
think
i
speak
not
at
all
of
matters
such
as
these
and
for
my
present
errand
is
but
to
say
that
a
priest
of
the
inner
temple
waits
without
desirous
of
instant
speech
with
the
most
illustrious
a
priest
of
the
inner
temple
echoed
the
laureate
wonderingly
by
my
faith
a
most
unwelcome
visitor
what
business
can
he
have
with
me
nay
that
i
know
not
responded
irenya
calmly
he
hath
come
hither
so
he
bade
me
say
by
command
of
the
absolute
authority
face
flushed
and
he
looked
annoyed
then
taking
theos
by
the
arm
he
turned
away
from
the
terrace
and
his
apartment
where
he
flung
himself
full
length
on
his
couch
pillowing
his
handsome
head
against
a
fold
of
glossy
leopard
skin
which
formed
a
most
becoming
background
for
the
soft
dark
oval
beauty
of
his
features
sit
thee
down
my
friend
he
said
glancing
smilingly
at
theos
and
signing
to
him
to
take
possession
of
a
luxurious
near
if
we
must
needs
receive
this
sanctified
professor
of
many
hypocrisies
we
will
do
it
with
suitable
indifference
and
ease
wilt
thou
stay
here
with
us
irenya
he
added
stretching
out
one
arm
and
catching
the
maiden
round
the
waist
in
spite
of
her
attempted
or
art
thou
in
a
froward
mood
and
wilt
thou
go
thine
own
proud
way
without
so
much
as
a
consoling
kiss
from
irenya
looked
full
at
him
a
repressed
anger
blazing
in
her
large
black
eyes
let
my
lord
save
his
kisses
for
those
who
value
them
she
said
contemptuously
pity
he
should
waste
them
upon
me
to
whom
they
are
unmeaning
and
therefore
all
unwelcome
he
laughed
heartily
and
instantly
loosened
her
from
his
embrace
off
off
with
thee
sweet
virtue
fairest
prude
he
cried
still
live
out
thy
life
an
thou
wilt
empty
of
love
or
passion
count
the
years
as
they
slip
by
leaving
thee
each
day
less
lovely
and
less
fit
for
pleasure
grow
old
and
on
the
brink
of
death
look
back
poor
child
and
see
the
glory
thou
hast
missed
and
left
behind
thee
the
light
of
love
and
youth
that
once
departed
can
dawn
again
no
more
and
lifting
himself
slightly
from
his
cushions
he
kissed
his
hand
playfully
to
the
girl
who
as
though
suddenly
overcome
by
a
sort
of
vague
regret
still
lingered
gazing
at
him
while
a
faint
color
crept
through
her
cheeks
like
the
deepening
hue
on
the
leaves
of
an
opening
rose
saw
her
hesitation
and
his
face
grew
yet
more
radiant
with
malicious
mirth
hence
irenya
he
exclaimed
escape
temptation
quickly
while
thou
mayest
support
thy
virgin
pride
in
peace
thou
shalt
never
say
again
kisses
are
unwelcome
the
poet
touch
shall
never
wrong
or
sanctify
thy
name
thou
art
safe
from
me
as
pillared
icicles
in
everlasting
snow
dear
little
one
be
happy
without
love
if
that
be
possible
nevertheless
take
heed
thou
do
not
weakly
clamor
in
the
for
once
rejected
joy
now
bid
yon
waiting
priest
attend
me
tell
him
i
can
but
spare
a
few
brief
moments
audience
irenya
head
drooped
theos
saw
tears
in
her
eyes
but
she
managed
to
restrain
them
and
with
something
of
a
defiant
air
she
made
her
formal
obeisance
and
withdrew
she
did
not
return
again
but
a
page
appeared
instead
ushering
in
with
ceremonious
civility
a
tall
personage
clad
in
flowing
white
robes
and
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
in
a
mantle
of
silver
tissue
a
majestic
mysterious
individual
who
pausing
on
the
threshold
of
the
apartment
described
a
circle
in
the
air
with
a
small
staff
he
carried
and
said
in
monotonous
accents
by
the
and
of
the
sun
through
the
gates
of
the
east
and
the
gates
of
the
west
by
the
vulture
of
gold
and
white
lotus
and
the
countless
virtues
of
nagaya
may
peace
dwell
in
this
house
forever
agreed
to
with
all
my
heart
responded
carelessly
looking
up
from
his
couch
but
making
no
attempt
to
rise
peace
is
an
excellent
thing
most
holy
father
excellent
returned
the
priest
slowly
advancing
and
undoing
his
mantle
so
that
his
face
became
fully
visible
so
truly
excellent
indeed
that
at
times
it
is
needful
to
make
war
in
order
to
insure
it
he
sat
down
as
he
spoke
in
a
chair
which
was
placed
for
him
at
bidding
by
the
page
who
had
ushered
him
in
and
he
maintained
a
grave
silence
till
that
youthful
servitor
had
departed
theos
meanwhile
studied
his
countenance
with
some
curiosity
it
was
so
strangely
impassive
yet
at
the
same
time
so
full
of
distinctly
marked
intellectual
power
the
features
were
handsome
but
also
singularly
repulsive
they
were
rendered
in
a
certain
degree
dignified
by
a
full
dark
beard
which
however
failed
entirely
to
conceal
the
receding
chin
and
compressed
cruel
mouth
the
eyes
were
keen
and
crafty
and
very
clear
the
forehead
was
high
and
intelligent
and
deeply
furrowed
with
lines
that
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
much
pondering
over
close
and
cunning
calculation
rather
than
the
marks
of
profound
unselfish
and
ennobling
thought
the
page
having
left
the
room
began
the
conversation
to
what
unexpected
cause
most
righteous
sir
am
i
indebted
for
the
honor
of
this
present
visit
methinks
i
recognize
the
countenance
of
the
famous
zel
the
of
the
sacrificial
altar
if
so
is
marvellous
so
great
a
man
should
venture
forth
alone
and
unattended
to
the
house
of
one
who
loves
not
priestly
company
and
who
hath
at
best
for
all
professors
of
religion
a
somewhat
indifferent
welcome
the
priest
smiled
coldly
most
rightly
dost
thou
speak
he
answered
his
measured
metallic
voice
seeming
to
strike
a
wave
of
chilling
discord
through
the
air
and
most
frankly
hast
thou
thus
declared
one
of
thy
many
deficiencies
atheist
as
thou
art
and
to
that
manner
born
thou
art
in
very
deed
outside
the
pale
of
all
religious
teaching
and
consolement
nevertheless
there
is
much
gentle
mercy
shown
thee
by
the
virgin
priestess
of
nagaya
here
he
solemnly
bent
his
head
and
made
the
rapid
sign
of
a
circle
on
his
breast
who
knowing
thy
great
genius
doth
ever
strive
with
thoughtful
zeal
to
draw
thee
closely
within
the
saving
silver
veil
yet
it
is
possible
that
even
her
patience
with
thy
sins
may
tire
at
last
wherefore
while
there
is
time
offer
due
penance
to
the
offended
gods
and
humble
thy
stiff
heart
before
the
holy
maid
lest
she
expel
thee
from
her
sight
forever
he
paused
a
satirical
smile
hovered
round
delicate
mouth
his
eyes
flashed
all
this
is
the
mere
common
rhetoric
of
the
temple
craft
he
said
why
not
good
zel
give
plainer
utterance
to
thine
errand
we
know
each
other
follies
well
enough
to
spare
formalities
lysia
has
sent
thee
hither
what
then
what
says
the
beauteous
virgin
to
her
willing
slave
an
undertone
of
mockery
rang
through
the
languid
silvery
sweetness
of
his
accents
and
the
priest
dark
brows
knitted
in
an
irritated
frown
thou
art
of
speech
he
observed
austerely
take
heed
thou
be
not
snared
into
misfortune
by
the
glibness
of
thy
tongue
thou
dost
speak
of
the
chaste
lysia
with
unseemly
learn
to
be
reverent
and
so
shalt
thou
be
wiser
laughed
and
settled
himself
more
easily
on
his
couch
turning
in
such
a
manner
as
to
look
the
stately
zel
full
in
the
face
they
exchanged
one
glance
expressive
as
it
seemed
of
some
mutual
secret
understanding
for
the
priest
coughed
as
though
he
were
embarrassed
and
stroked
his
beard
deliberately
with
one
hand
in
an
endeavor
to
hide
the
strange
smile
that
despite
his
efforts
to
conceal
it
visibly
lightened
his
cold
eyes
to
a
sudden
tigerish
brilliancy
the
mission
with
which
i
am
charged
he
resumed
presently
is
to
thee
chief
laureate
of
the
realm
and
runs
as
followeth
whereas
thou
hast
of
late
avoided
many
days
of
public
service
in
the
temple
so
that
those
among
the
people
who
admire
thee
follow
thine
ill
example
and
absent
themselves
also
with
equal
readiness
the
priestess
undefiled
the
noble
lysia
doth
command
thy
presence
as
a
duty
not
to
be
foregone
therefore
come
thou
and
take
thy
part
in
the
great
sacrifice
for
these
late
tumults
and
disaster
in
the
city
notably
the
perplexing
downfall
of
the
obelisk
have
caused
all
hearts
to
fail
and
sink
for
very
fear
the
river
darkens
in
its
crimson
hue
each
hour
by
passing
hour
strange
noises
have
been
heard
athwart
the
sky
and
in
the
deeper
underground
and
all
these
drear
unwonted
things
are
so
many
cogent
reasons
why
we
should
in
solemn
unison
implore
the
favor
of
nagaya
and
the
gods
whereby
further
catastrophes
may
be
perchance
averted
moreover
for
motives
of
most
urgent
it
is
advisable
that
all
who
hold
place
dignity
and
renown
within
the
city
should
this
night
be
seen
as
fervent
supplicants
before
the
sacred
shrine
so
may
much
threatening
rebellion
be
appeased
and
order
be
restored
out
of
impending
confusion
such
is
the
message
i
am
bidden
to
convey
to
thee
furthermore
i
am
required
to
bear
back
again
to
the
high
priestess
thy
faithful
promise
that
her
orders
shall
be
surely
and
entirely
obeyed
thou
art
not
wont
and
a
pale
sneer
flitted
over
his
to
set
her
mandate
at
defiance
bit
his
lips
angrily
and
folded
his
arms
above
his
head
with
a
lazy
yet
impatient
movement
assuredly
i
shall
be
present
at
the
service
he
said
there
needed
no
such
weighty
summoning
was
my
intention
to
join
the
ranks
of
worshippers
though
for
myself
i
have
no
faith
in
worship
the
gods
i
ween
are
deaf
and
care
not
a
jot
whether
we
mortals
weep
or
sing
nevertheless
i
shall
look
on
with
fitting
gravity
and
deport
myself
with
due
decorum
throughout
the
ceremonious
ritual
though
verily
i
tell
thee
reverend
zel
is
tedious
and
monotonous
at
best
and
concerning
the
poor
it
is
a
shuddering
horror
we
could
well
dispense
with
i
think
not
so
replied
the
priest
calmly
thou
who
art
well
instructed
in
the
capricious
humors
of
men
must
surely
know
how
dearly
the
majority
of
them
love
the
shedding
of
blood
is
a
clamorous
in
them
which
must
be
satisfied
better
therefore
that
we
the
anointed
priests
should
slay
one
willing
victim
for
the
purposes
of
religion
than
that
they
the
ignorant
mob
should
kill
a
thousand
to
gratify
their
lust
of
murder
an
unresentful
deity
would
be
impossible
of
comprehension
to
a
mutually
hating
and
malignant
race
of
beings
all
creeds
must
be
accommodated
to
the
dispositions
of
the
million
pardon
me
suddenly
interrupted
theos
i
am
a
stranger
and
in
a
great
measure
ignorant
of
this
city
customs
but
i
confess
i
am
amazed
to
hear
a
priest
uphold
so
specious
an
argument
what
must
divine
religion
be
dragged
down
from
its
pure
throne
to
pander
to
the
selfish
passions
of
the
multitude
because
men
are
vile
must
a
vile
god
be
invented
to
suit
their
savage
caprices
because
men
are
so
cruel
must
the
unseen
creator
of
things
be
delineated
as
even
more
barbarous
than
they
in
order
to
give
them
some
pietistical
excuse
for
wickedness
i
ask
these
questions
not
out
of
wanton
curiosity
but
for
the
sake
of
instruction
the
haughty
zel
turned
upon
him
in
severe
astonishment
sir
he
said
stranger
undoubtedly
thou
art
and
so
bold
a
manner
of
speech
most
truly
savors
of
the
utterly
uneducated
western
barbarian
all
wise
and
prudent
governments
have
learned
that
a
god
fit
for
the
adoration
of
men
must
be
depicted
as
much
like
men
as
possible
any
absolutely
superhuman
attributes
are
unnecessary
to
the
character
of
a
useful
deity
inasmuch
as
no
man
ever
will
or
ever
can
understand
the
worth
of
superhuman
qualities
humanity
is
only
capable
of
worshipping
self
thus
it
is
necessary
that
when
people
are
persuaded
to
pay
honor
to
an
elected
divinity
they
should
be
well
and
comfortably
assured
in
their
own
minds
that
they
are
but
offering
homage
to
an
image
of
self
placed
before
them
in
a
deified
or
heroic
form
this
satisfies
the
natural
idolatrous
cravings
of
egotism
and
this
is
all
that
priests
or
teachers
desire
now
in
the
worship
of
nagaya
we
have
the
natures
of
man
and
woman
conjoined
the
snake
is
the
emblem
of
male
wisdom
united
with
female
subtilty
and
the
two
essences
mingled
in
one
make
as
near
an
approach
to
what
we
may
imagine
the
positive
divine
capacity
as
can
be
devised
on
earth
by
earthly
intelligences
if
on
the
other
hand
such
an
absurd
doctrine
as
that
formulated
in
the
fanatic
madman
khosrul
could
be
imagined
as
actually
admitted
and
proclaimed
to
the
nations
it
would
have
very
few
followers
and
the
sincerity
of
those
few
might
well
be
open
to
doubt
for
the
deity
it
speaks
of
is
supposed
to
be
an
immortal
god
disguised
as
man
a
god
who
voluntarily
rejects
and
sets
aside
his
own
glory
to
serve
and
save
his
perishable
creatures
thus
the
root
of
that
religion
would
consist
in
and
is
as
experience
proves
utterly
impossible
to
the
human
being
why
is
it
impossible
asked
theos
with
a
quiver
of
passionate
earnestness
in
his
voice
are
there
none
in
all
the
world
who
would
sacrifice
their
own
interests
to
further
another
welfare
and
happiness
the
priest
smiled
a
delicately
derisive
smile
certainly
not
he
replied
the
very
question
strikes
me
as
singularly
foolish
inasmuch
as
we
live
in
a
planet
where
if
we
do
not
serve
ourselves
and
look
after
our
own
personal
advantage
we
may
as
well
die
the
minute
we
are
born
or
better
still
never
be
born
at
all
there
is
no
one
living
at
least
not
in
the
wide
realm
of
who
would
put
himself
to
the
smallest
inconvenience
for
the
sake
of
another
were
that
other
his
nearest
and
dearest
and
in
matters
of
love
and
friendship
is
the
same
as
in
business
each
man
eagerly
pursues
his
own
chance
of
enjoyment
even
when
he
loves
or
fancies
he
loves
a
woman
it
is
solely
because
her
beauty
or
attractiveness
gives
him
temporary
pleasure
not
because
he
has
any
tenderness
or
for
the
nature
of
her
feelings
how
can
it
be
otherwise
we
elect
friends
that
are
useful
to
us
personally
we
care
little
for
their
intrinsic
merit
and
we
only
tolerate
them
as
long
as
they
happen
to
suit
our
taste
for
generally
on
the
first
occasion
of
a
disagreement
or
difference
of
opinion
we
shake
ourselves
free
of
them
without
either
regret
or
remorse
and
seek
others
who
will
be
meek
enough
not
to
offer
us
any
open
contradiction
it
is
and
it
must
be
always
so
self
is
the
first
person
we
are
bound
to
consider
and
all
religions
if
they
are
intended
to
last
must
prudently
recognize
and
silently
acquiesce
in
this
the
chief
dogma
of
man
constitution
laughed
excellently
argued
most
politic
zel
he
yet
methinks
it
is
easy
to
worship
self
without
either
consecrated
altars
or
priestly
assistance
thou
shouldst
know
better
than
any
one
with
what
facility
such
devotion
can
be
practiced
returned
zel
ironically
rising
as
he
spoke
and
beginning
to
wrap
his
mantle
round
him
preparatory
to
departure
thou
hast
a
wider
range
of
perpetual
adoration
than
most
men
seeing
thou
dost
so
fully
estimate
the
value
of
thine
own
genius
some
heretics
there
are
in
the
city
who
say
thy
merit
is
but
a
trick
of
song
shared
by
thee
in
common
with
the
birds
who
truly
seem
to
take
no
pride
in
the
particular
sweetness
of
their
unsyllabled
language
but
thou
thyself
art
better
instructed
and
who
shall
blame
thee
for
the
veneration
with
which
thou
dost
daily
contemplate
thine
own
intellectual
powers
not
i
believe
me
and
his
crafty
eyes
glittered
mockingly
as
he
arranged
his
silver
gauze
muffler
so
that
it
entirely
veiled
the
lower
part
of
his
features
and
though
i
do
somewhat
regret
to
learn
that
thou
among
other
noblemen
of
fashion
hast
of
late
taken
part
in
the
atheistic
discussions
encouraged
by
the
positivist
school
of
thought
still
as
a
priest
my
duty
is
not
so
much
to
reproach
as
to
call
thee
to
repentance
therefore
i
inwardly
rejoice
to
know
thou
wilt
present
thyself
before
the
shrine
if
only
for
the
sake
of
custom
for
the
sake
of
custom
repeated
amusedly
nay
good
zel
custom
should
be
surely
classified
as
an
exceeding
powerful
god
inasmuch
as
it
rules
all
things
from
the
cut
of
our
clothes
to
the
form
of
our
creeds
true
replied
zel
imperturbably
and
he
who
despises
custom
becomes
an
alien
from
his
kind
a
moral
leper
among
the
pure
and
clean
oh
say
rather
a
lion
among
sheep
a
giant
among
pigmies
laughed
the
laureate
for
by
my
soul
a
man
who
had
the
courage
to
scorn
custom
and
set
the
small
hypocrisies
of
society
at
defiance
would
be
a
glorious
hero
a
warrior
of
strange
integrity
whom
it
would
be
well
worth
travelling
miles
to
see
khosrul
was
such
an
one

theos
suddenly
tush
man
khosrul
was
mad
retorted
are
not
all
men
thought
mad
who
speak
the
truth
queried
theos
gently
the
priest
zel
looked
at
him
with
proud
and
supercilious
eyes
thou
hast
strange
notions
for
one
still
young
he
said
what
art
thou
a
new
disciple
of
the
mystics
or
a
student
of
the
positive
doctrines
theos
met
his
gaze
unflinchingly
what
am

he
murmured
sadly
and
his
voice
trembled
reverend
priest
i
am
nothing
great
are
the
sufferings
of
men
who
have
lost
their
wealth
their
home
their
friends
but
i
i
have
lost
myself
were
i
anything
could
i
ever
hope
to
be
anything
i
would
pray
to
be
accepted
a
servant
of
the
cross
that
unknown
faith
to
which
my
tired
spirit
clings
as
he
uttered
these
words
he
raised
his
eyes
how
dim
and
misty
at
the
moment
seemed
the
tall
white
figure
of
the
majestic
zel
and
in
contrast
to
it
how
brilliantly
distinct
radiant
face
appeared
turned
toward
him
in
inquiring
wonderment
he
felt
a
swooning
dizziness
upon
him
but
the
sensation
swiftly
passed
and
he
saw
the
haughty
priest
dark
brows
bent
upon
him
in
a
frown
of
ominous
disapproval
is
well
thou
art
not
a
citizen
of
he
said
scornfully
to
strangers
we
accord
a
certain
license
of
opinion
but
if
thou
wert
a
native
of
these
realms
thy
speech
would
cost
thee
dear
as
it
is
i
warn
thee
dare
not
to
make
public
mention
of
the
cross
the
accursed
emblem
of
the
dead
khosrul
idolatry
guard
thy
tongue
heedfully
and
thou
if
thou
dost
bring
this
rashling
with
thee
to
the
temple
thou
must
take
upon
thyself
all
measures
for
his
safety
for
in
these
days
some
words
are
like
firebrands
and
he
who
casts
them
forth
incautiously
may
kindle
flames
that
only
the
forfeit
of
his
life
can
quench
there
was
a
quiver
of
suppressed
fury
in
his
tone
and
lifted
his
lazy
lids
and
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
tranquil
indifference
prithee
trouble
not
thyself
most
eminent
zel
he
answered
nonchalantly
i
will
answer
for
my
friend
discretion
thou
dost
mistake
his
temperament
he
is
a
budding
poet
and
utters
many
a
disconnected
thought
which
hath
no
meaning
save
to
his
own
brain
he
saw
the
frantic
khosrul
die
and
the
picture
hath
impressed
him
for
the
moment
nothing
more
i
pledge
my
word
for
his
demurest
prudence
at
the
service
i
would
not
have
him
absent
for
the
world
pity
he
should
miss
the
splendor
of
a
scene
which
doubtless
hath
been
admirably
contrived
by
priestly
art
and
skill
to
play
upon
the
passions
of
the
multitude
tell
me
good
zel
what
is
the
name
of
the
victim
the
priest
flashed
a
strangely
malevolent
glance
at
him
is
not
to
be
divulged
he
replied
curtly
the
virgin
is
no
longer
counted
among
the
living
she
is
as
one
already
departed
the
name
she
bore
hath
been
erased
from
the
city
registers
and
she
wears
instead
the
prouder
title
of
of
the
sun
and
nagaya
restrain
thy
curiosity
until
night
hath
fallen
it
may
be
that
thou
who
hast
a
wide
acquaintance
among
fair
maidens
wilt
recognize
her
countenance
nay
i
trust
i
know
her
not
said
carelessly
for
though
all
women
die
for
me
when
once
their
beauty
fades
still
am
i
loth
to
see
them
perish
ere
their
prime
yet
many
are
doomed
to
perish
so
rejoined
the
priest
impassively
men
as
well
as
women
and
methinks
those
who
are
best
beloved
of
the
gods
are
chosen
first
to
die
death
is
not
difficult
but
to
live
long
enough
for
life
to
lose
all
savor
and
love
all
charm
this
is
a
bitterness
that
comes
with
years
and
can
not
be
consoled
and
retreating
slowly
toward
the
door
he
paused
as
he
had
previously
done
on
the
threshold
farewell
he
said
beware
that
nothing
hinders
thee
from
the
fulfillment
of
thy
promise
and
let
thy
homage
to
the
holy
maid
be
reverent
at
the
parting
of
the
silver
veil
he
waited
but
made
no
answer
he
therefore
raised
his
staff
and
described
a
circle
with
it
in
the
same
solemn
fashion
that
had
distinguished
his
entrance
by
the
of
the
moon
through
the
ways
of
darkness
by
the
shining
of
stars
by
the
sleeping
sun
and
the
silence
of
night
by
the
eye
of
raphon
and
the
wisdom
of
nagaya
may
the
protection
of
the
gods
abide
in
this
house
forever
as
he
pronounced
these
words
he
noiselessly
departed
without
any
salutation
whatever
to
who
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
had
gone
and
rising
from
his
couch
came
and
placed
one
hand
affectionately
on
theos
shoulder
thou
foolish
yet
dear
comrade
he
what
moves
thee
to
blurt
forth
such
strange
and
unwarrantable
sayings
why
wouldst
thou
pray
to
be
a
servant
of
the
cross
or
why
at
any
rate
if
thou
hast
taken
a
fancy
for
the
dead
khosrul
new
doctrine
wert
thou
so
rash
as
to
proclaim
thy
sentiment
to
yon
unprincipled
bloodthirsty
zel
who
would
not
scruple
to
poison
the
king
himself
if
his
majesty
gave
sufficient
cause
of
offence
dost
thou
desire
to
be
straightway
slain
nay
i
will
not
have
thee
run
thus
furiously
into
danger
thou
wilt
be
offered
the
silver
nectar
like
and
not
even
the
intercession
of
my
friendship
would
avail
to
save
thee
then
theos
smiled
rather
sadly
and
thus
would
end
for
ever
my
mistakes
and
follies
he
answered
and
i
should
perchance
discover
the
small
hidden
secret
of
things
the
little
simple
unguessed
clue
that
would
unravel
the
mystery
and
meaning
of
existence
for
can
it
be
that
the
majestic
marvel
of
created
nature
is
purposeless
in
its
design
that
we
are
doomed
to
think
thoughts
which
can
never
be
realized
to
dream
dreams
that
perish
in
the
dreaming
to
build
up
hopes
without
foundation
to
call
upon
god
when
there
is
no
god
to
long
for
heaven
when
there
is
no
heaven
ah
no
surely
we
are
not
the
mere
fools
and
dupes
of
time
surely
there
is
some
eternal
beyond
which
is
not
annihilation
some
greater
vaster
sphere
of
where
we
shall
find
all
that
we
have
missed
on
earth
face
clouded
and
a
sigh
escaped
him
i
would
my
thoughts
were
similar
to
thine
he
said
i
would
i
could
believe
in
an
immortal
destiny
but
alas
my
friend
there
is
no
shadow
of
ground
for
such
a
happy
faith
none
neither
in
sense
nor
science
i
have
reflected
on
it
many
a
time
till
i
have
wearied
myself
with
mournful
musing
and
the
end
of
all
my
meditation
has
been
a
useless
protest
against
the
great
inevitable
a
clamor
of
disdain
hurled
at
the
huge
blind
indifferent
force
that
poisons
the
deep
sea
of
space
with
an
spawn
of
wasted
life
anon
i
have
flouted
my
own
despair
and
have
consoled
myself
with
the
old
wise
maxim
that
was
found
inscribed
on
the
statue
of
a
smiling
god
some
centuries
your
lives
ye
passing
tribes
of
men
take
pleasure
in
folly
for
this
is
the
only
wisdom
that
avails
happy
is
he
whose
days
are
filled
with
the
delight
of
love
and
laughter
for
there
is
nothing
better
found
on
earth
and
whatsoever
ye
do
whether
wise
or
foolish
the
same
end
comes
to
all
is
not
this
true
philosophy
my
theos
what
can
a
man
do
better
than
enjoy
much
depends
on
the
particular
form
of
enjoyment
responded
theos
thoughtfully
some
there
are
for
example
who
might
find
their
greatest
satisfaction
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
others
in
the
gratification
of
sensual
desires
and
gross
appetites
are
these
to
be
left
to
follow
their
own
devices
without
any
effort
being
made
to
raise
them
from
the
where
they
lie
why
in
the
name
of
all
the
gods
should
they
be
raised
demanded
impatiently
if
their
choice
is
to
grovel
in
mire
why
ask
them
to
dwell
in
a
palace
they
would
not
appreciate
the
change
again
went
on
theos
there
are
others
who
are
only
happy
in
the
pursuit
of
wisdom
and
the
more
they
learn
the
more
they
seek
to
know
one
wonders
one
can
not
help
are
their
aspirations
all
in
vain
and
will
the
grave
seal
down
their
hopes
forever
paused
a
moment
before
replying
it
seems
so
he
said
at
last
slowly
and
hesitatingly
and
herein
i
find
the
injustice
of
the
matter
because
however
great
may
be
the
imagination
and
fervor
of
a
poet
for
instance
he
never
is
able
wholly
to
utter
his
thoughts
half
of
them
remain
in
embryo
like
buds
of
flowers
that
never
come
to
bloom
yet
they
are
there
burning
in
the
brain
and
seeming
too
vast
of
conception
to
syllable
themselves
into
the
common
speech
of
mortals
i
have
often
marvelled
why
such
ideas
suggest
themselves
at
all
as
they
can
neither
be
written
nor
spoken
unless
and
here
his
voice
sank
into
a
dreamy
softness
unless
indeed
they
are
to
be
received
as
hints
of
greater
works
destined
for
our
accomplishment
hereafter
he
was
silent
a
minute
space
and
theos
watching
him
wistfully
suddenly
asked
wouldst
thou
be
willing
to
live
again
if
such
a
thing
could
be
friend
i
would
rather
never
die
responded
the
laureate
half
playfully
half
if
i
were
certain
that
death
was
no
more
than
a
sleep
from
which
i
should
assuredly
awaken
to
another
phase
of
existence
know
well
enough
what
i
would
do
what
questioned
theos
his
heart
beginning
to
beat
with
an
almost
insufferable
anxiety
i
would
live
a
different
life
now
answered
steadily
looking
his
companion
full
in
the
eyes
as
he
spoke
while
a
grave
smile
shadowed
rather
than
lightened
his
features
i
would
begin
at
once
so
that
when
the
new
future
dawned
for
me
i
might
not
be
haunted
or
tortured
by
the
remembrance
of
a
misspent
past
for
if
we
are
to
believe
in
any
everlasting
things
at
all
we
can
not
shut
out
the
fatal
everlastingness
of
memory
his
words
sounded
unlike
himself
his
voice
was
as
the
voice
of
some
reproving
angel
speaking
and
theos
listening
shuddered
he
knew
not
why
and
held
his
peace
never
to
be
able
to
forget
continued
in
the
same
grave
sweet
tone
never
to
lose
sight
of
one
own
bygone
wilful
sins
this
would
be
an
immortal
destiny
too
terrible
to
endure
for
then
inexorable
retrospection
would
forever
show
us
where
we
had
missed
the
way
and
how
we
had
failed
to
use
the
chances
given
us
moreover
we
might
haply
find
ourselves
surrounded
and
his
accents
grew
slower
and
more
by
strange
phantoms
of
our
own
creating
who
would
act
anew
the
drama
of
our
obstinate
past
follies
perplexing
us
thereby
into
an
anguish
greater
than
mortal
fancy
can
depict
thus
if
we
indeed
possessed
the
positive
foreknowledge
of
the
eternal
regeneration
of
our
lives
be
well
to
free
them
from
all
hindrance
to
perfection
here
here
while
we
are
still
conscious
of
time
and
opportunity
he
paused
then
went
on
in
his
customary
gay
manner
but
fortunately
we
are
not
positive
nothing
is
certain
no
truth
is
so
satisfactorily
demonstrated
that
some
wiseacre
can
not
be
found
to
disprove
it
hence
it
happens
my
friend
and
his
face
assumed
its
wonted
careless
expression
that
we
men
whose
is
offended
by
priestly
hypocrisy
and
occult
necromantic
jugglery
we
who
perhaps
in
our
innermost
heart
of
hearts
ardently
desire
to
believe
in
a
supreme
divinity
and
the
grandly
progressive
sublime
intention
of
the
universe
but
who
discovering
naught
but
ignoble
cant
and
imposture
everywhere
are
incontinently
thrown
back
on
our
own
resources
hence
it
comes
i
say
that
we
are
satisfied
to
accept
ourselves
each
man
in
his
own
personality
as
the
beginning
and
end
of
existence
and
to
minister
to
that
absolute
self
which
after
all
concerns
us
most
and
which
will
continue
to
engage
our
best
service
until
well
until
history
can
show
us
a
perfectly
selfless
example
which
if
human
nature
remains
consistent
with
its
own
traditions
will
assuredly
never
be
this
was
almost
more
than
theos
could
bear
there
was
a
tightening
agony
at
his
heart
that
made
him
long
to
cry
out
to
weep
or
better
still
to
fling
himself
on
his
knees
and
pray
pray
to
that
mild
presence
that
selfless
example
who
he
knew
had
hallowed
and
dignified
the
world
and
yet
whose
holy
and
beloved
name
he
miserable
sinner
was
unworthy
to
even
remember
his
suffering
at
the
moment
was
so
intense
that
he
fancied
some
reflection
of
it
must
be
visible
in
his
face
however
apparently
saw
nothing
he
stepped
across
the
room
and
out
to
the
loggia
where
he
turned
and
beckoned
his
companion
to
his
side
come
he
said
pushing
his
hair
off
his
brows
with
a
languid
gesture
the
afternoon
wears
onward
and
the
very
heavens
seem
to
smoke
with
heat
let
us
seek
cooler
air
beneath
the
shade
of
yonder
cypresses
whose
boughs
shut
out
the
glaring
sky
we
talk
of
love
and
poesy
and
tender
things
till
sunset
i
will
recite
to
thee
a
ballad
of
mine
that
niphrata
loved
is
called
idyl
of
roses
and
it
will
lighten
this
hot
and
heavy
silence
when
even
birds
sleep
and
butterflies
drowse
in
the
hollowed
shelter
of
the
come
wilt
thou
perchance
we
shall
have
little
time
for
pleasant
discourse
as
he
spoke
theos
obediently
went
toward
him
with
the
dazed
sensations
of
one
under
the
influence
of
mesmerism
the
dazzling
face
and
luminous
eyes
of
the
laureate
exercised
over
him
an
indescribable
yet
resistless
authority
and
it
was
certain
that
wherever
led
the
way
he
was
bound
to
follow
only
as
he
mechanically
descended
from
the
terrace
into
the
garden
and
linked
his
arm
within
that
of
his
companion
he
was
conscious
of
a
vague
feeling
of
pity
for
himself
pity
that
he
should
have
dwindled
into
such
a
nonentity
when
was
so
renowned
a
celebrity
pity
too
that
he
should
have
somehow
never
been
able
to
devise
anything
original
in
the
art
of
poetry
this
last
was
evident
for
he
knew
already
that
the
idyl
of
roses
purposed
reciting
could
be
no
other
than
what
he
had
fancied
was
his
idyl
of
roses
a
poem
he
had
composed
or
rather
had
plagiarized
in
some
mysterious
fashion
before
he
had
even
dreamt
of
the
design
of
nourhalma
however
he
had
become
in
part
resigned
to
the
peculiar
position
he
occupied
he
was
just
a
little
sorry
for
himself
and
that
was
all
even
as
the
parted
spirit
of
a
dead
man
might
hover
ruthfully
above
the
grave
of
its
perished
mortal
body
so
he
compassionated
his
own
forlorn
estate
and
heaved
a
passing
sigh
of
regret
not
only
for
all
he
once
had
been
but
also
for
all
he
could
never
be
chapter
xxvii
in
the
temple
of
nagaya
the
hours
wore
on
with
stealthy
rapidity
but
the
two
friends
reclining
together
under
a
canopy
of
paid
little
or
no
heed
to
the
flight
of
time
the
heat
in
the
garden
was
intense
the
grass
was
dry
and
brittle
as
though
it
had
been
scorched
by
passing
flames
and
a
singularly
profound
stillness
reigned
everywhere
there
being
no
wind
to
stir
the
faintest
rustle
among
the
foliage
lying
lazily
upon
his
back
with
his
arms
clasped
above
his
head
theos
looked
dreamily
up
at
the
patches
of
blue
sky
seen
between
the
gnarled
stems
and
listened
to
the
measured
cadence
of
the
laureate
mellow
voice
as
he
recited
with
much
tenderness
the
promised
poem
of
course
it
was
perfectly
familiar
the
lines
were
precisely
the
same
as
those
which
he
theos
remembered
to
have
written
out
thinking
them
his
own
in
an
old
manuscript
book
he
had
left
at
home
where
was
that
it
must
be
a
very
long
way
off
he
his
eyes
a
sense
of
delightful
drowsiness
was
upon
him
the
rise
and
fall
of
his
friend
rhythmic
utterance
soothed
him
into
a
languid
peace
the
idyl
of
roses
was
very
sweet
and
musical
and
though
he
knew
it
of
old
he
heard
it
now
with
special
satisfaction
inasmuch
as
it
being
no
longer
his
he
was
at
liberty
to
bestow
upon
it
that
full
measure
of
admiration
which
he
felt
it
deserved
yet
every
now
and
then
his
thoughts
wandered
and
though
he
anxiously
strove
to
concentrate
his
attention
on
the
lovely
stanzas
that
murmured
past
his
ears
like
the
gentle
sound
of
waves
flowing
beneath
the
mesmerism
of
the
moon
his
brain
was
in
a
continual
state
of
ferment
and
busied
itself
with
all
manner
of
vague
suggestions
to
which
he
could
give
no
name
a
great
weariness
weighed
down
his
spirit
a
dim
consciousness
of
the
futility
of
all
ambition
and
all
endeavor
he
was
haunted
too
by
the
sharp
hiss
of
lysia
voice
when
she
had
said
kill
her
look
her
attitude
her
murderous
smile
troubled
his
memory
and
made
him
ill
at
ease
the
thing
she
had
thus
demanded
at
his
hands
seemed
more
monstrous
than
if
she
had
bidden
him
kill
himself
for
there
had
been
one
moment
when
mastered
by
her
beauty
and
the
force
of
his
own
passion
he
would
have
killed
himself
had
she
requested
it
but
to
kill
his
adored
his
beloved
friend
ah
no
not
for
a
thousand
as
fair
as
she
he
drew
a
long
breath
an
irresistible
desire
for
rest
came
over
him
the
air
was
heavy
and
warm
and
fragrant
his
dulcet
accents
served
as
a
lullaby
to
his
tired
mind
it
seemed
a
long
time
since
he
had
enjoyed
a
pleasant
slumber
for
the
previous
night
he
had
not
slept
at
all
lower
and
lower
drooped
his
aching
lids
he
was
almost
beginning
to
slip
away
slowly
into
a
blissful
unconsciousness
when
all
at
once
ceased
reciting
and
a
harsh
brazen
clang
of
bells
echoed
through
the
silence
storming
to
and
fro
with
a
violent
hurried
uproar
suggestive
of
some
sudden
alarm
he
sprang
to
his
feet
rubbing
his
eyes
rose
also
a
slightly
petulant
expression
on
his
face
canst
thou
do
no
better
than
sleep
he
queried
complainingly
when
thou
art
privileged
to
listen
to
an
immortal
poem
impulsively
theos
caught
his
hand
and
pressed
it
fervently
nay
dost
thou
deem
me
so
indifferent
my
noble
friend
he
cried
thou
art
mistaken
for
though
perchance
mine
eyes
were
closed
my
ears
were
open
i
heard
thy
every
word
i
loved
thy
every
line
what
dost
thou
need
of
praise
thou
who
canst
do
naught
but
work
which
being
perfect
is
beyond
all
criticism
smiled
well
satisfied
and
the
little
lines
of
threatening
vanished
from
his
countenance
enough
he
i
know
that
thou
dost
truly
honor
me
above
all
poets
and
that
thou
wouldst
not
willingly
offend
hearest
thou
how
great
a
clamor
the
ringers
of
the
temple
make
is
but
the
sunset
chime
yet
one
would
think
they
were
pealing
forth
an
angry
summons
to
battle
already
sunset
exclaimed
theos
why
it
seems
scarce
a
minute
since
that
we
came
hither
aye
such
is
the
magic
charm
of
poesy
rejoined
it
makes
the
hours
flit
like
moments
and
long
days
seemed
but
short
hours
nevertheless
is
time
we
were
within
doors
and
at
supper
for
if
we
start
not
soon
for
the
temple
be
difficult
to
gain
an
entrance
and
i
at
any
rate
must
be
early
in
my
place
beside
the
king
he
heaved
a
short
impatient
sigh
and
as
he
spoke
all
theos
old
misgivings
came
rushing
back
upon
him
and
in
full
force
filling
him
with
vague
sorrow
uneasiness
fear
but
he
knew
how
useless
it
was
to
try
and
impart
any
of
his
inward
forebodings
to
who
had
so
lightly
explained
lysia
treacherous
conduct
to
his
own
entire
satisfaction
on
whom
neither
the
prophecies
of
khosrul
nor
the
various
disastrous
events
of
the
day
had
taken
any
permanent
effect
while
no
attempt
could
now
be
made
to
deter
him
from
attending
the
sacrificial
service
in
the
temple
seeing
he
had
been
so
positively
commanded
thither
by
lysia
through
the
medium
of
the
priest
zel
feeling
bitterly
his
own
incompetency
to
exercise
any
protective
influence
on
the
fate
of
his
companion
theos
said
nothing
but
silently
followed
him
as
he
thrust
aside
the
drooping
cypress
boughs
and
made
his
way
out
to
more
open
ground
his
lithe
graceful
figure
looking
even
more
brilliant
and
than
ever
contrasted
with
the
deep
green
gloom
spread
about
him
by
the
hoary
trees
that
were
as
twisted
and
grotesque
in
shape
as
a
group
of
fetich
idols
as
he
bent
back
the
last
branchy
barrier
however
and
stepped
into
the
full
light
he
stopped
short
and
uttering
a
loud
exclamation
lifted
his
hand
and
pointed
westward
his
dark
eyes
dilating
with
amazement
and
awe
theos
at
once
came
swiftly
up
beside
him
and
looked
where
he
looked
what
a
scene
of
terrific
splendor
he
beheld
right
across
the
horizon
that
glistened
with
a
pale
green
hue
like
newly
frozen
water
a
cloud
black
as
the
blackest
midnight
lay
heavy
and
motionless
in
form
resembling
an
enormous
leaf
fringed
at
the
edges
with
tremulous
lines
of
gold
this
nebulous
mass
was
absolutely
stirless
it
appeared
as
though
it
had
been
thrown
a
ponderous
weight
into
the
vault
of
heaven
and
having
fallen
there
purposed
to
remain
ever
and
anon
beamy
threads
of
lightning
played
through
it
luridly
veining
it
with
long
arrowy
flashes
of
orange
and
silver
while
poised
immediately
above
it
was
the
sun
looking
like
a
dull
scarlet
seal
a
ball
of
dim
fire
destitute
of
rays
on
all
sides
the
sky
was
crossed
by
wavy
flecks
of
pearl
and
sudden
glimpses
as
of
burning
topaz
and
down
toward
the
earth
drooped
a
thin
azure
fog
filmy
curtain
through
which
the
landscape
took
the
strangest
tints
and
unearthly
flushes
of
color
a
moment
and
the
spectral
sun
dropped
suddenly
into
the
lower
darkness
leaving
behind
it
a
glare
of
gold
and
green
lowering
purple
shadows
crept
over
across
the
heavens
darkening
them
as
smoke
darkens
flame
but
the
huge
cloud
palpitating
with
lightning
moved
not
at
all
nor
changed
its
shape
by
so
much
as
a
hair
breadth
it
appeared
like
a
vast
pall
spread
out
in
readiness
for
the
solemn
of
the
world
fascinated
by
the
aspect
of
the
weird
theos
was
at
the
same
time
curiously
impressed
by
a
sense
of
its
unreality
indeed
he
found
himself
considering
it
with
the
calm
attentiveness
of
one
who
is
brought
face
to
face
with
a
remarkable
picture
effectively
painted
this
peculiar
sensation
however
was
like
many
others
of
his
experience
very
transitory
it
passed
and
he
watched
the
lightnings
come
and
go
with
a
certain
hesitating
fear
mingled
with
wonder
was
the
first
to
speak
storm
at
last
he
said
forcing
a
smile
though
his
face
was
unusually
pale
it
has
threatened
us
all
day
break
before
the
night
is
over
how
sullenly
yonder
heavens
frown
they
have
quenched
the
sun
in
their
sable
darkness
as
though
it
were
a
beaten
foe
this
will
seem
an
ill
sign
to
those
who
worship
him
as
a
god
for
truly
he
doth
appear
to
have
withdrawn
himself
in
haste
and
anger
by
my
soul
is
a
dull
and
ominous
eve
and
a
slight
shudder
ran
through
his
delicate
frame
as
he
turned
toward
the
loggia
garlanded
with
its
climbing
vines
roses
and
through
which
there
now
floated
a
dim
golden
suffused
radiance
reflected
from
lamps
lit
within
i
would
the
night
were
past
and
that
the
new
day
had
come
with
these
words
he
entered
the
house
theos
accompanying
him
and
together
they
went
at
once
to
the
there
they
supped
royally
served
by
silent
and
attentive
slaves
they
themselves
feeling
mutually
depressed
yet
apparently
not
wishing
to
communicate
their
depression
one
to
the
other
conversed
but
little
after
the
repast
was
finished
they
set
forth
on
foot
to
the
temple
informing
his
companion
as
they
went
that
it
was
against
the
law
to
use
any
chariot
or
other
sort
of
conveyance
to
go
to
the
place
of
worship
the
king
himself
being
obliged
to
dispense
with
his
sumptuous
car
on
such
occasions
and
to
walk
thither
as
unostentatiously
as
any
one
of
his
poorest
subjects
an
excellent
rule
observed
theos
reflectively
for
the
pomp
and
glitter
of
an
earthly
potentate
display
assorts
ill
with
the
homage
he
intends
to
offer
to
the
immortals
and
kings
are
no
more
than
commoners
in
the
sight
of
an
divinity
true
if
there
were
an
divinity
rejoined
dryly
but
in
the
present
state
of
doubt
regarding
the
existence
of
any
such
omnipotent
personage
thinkest
thou
there
is
a
monarch
living
who
is
sincerely
willing
to
admit
the
possibility
of
any
power
superior
to
himself
not
zephoranim
believe
me
his
enforced
humility
on
all
occasions
of
public
religious
observance
serves
him
merely
as
a
new
channel
wherein
to
proclaim
his
pride
certes
in
obedience
to
the
priests
or
rather
let
us
say
in
obedience
to
the
high
priestess
he
paces
the
common
in
company
with
the
common
folk
uncrowned
and
simply
clad
but
what
avails
this
affectation
of
meekness
all
know
him
for
the
king
all
make
servile
way
for
him
all
flatter
him
and
his
progress
to
the
temple
resembles
as
much
a
triumphal
procession
as
though
he
were
mounted
in
his
chariot
and
returning
from
some
wondrous
victory
besides
humility
in
my
opinion
is
more
a
weakness
than
a
virtue
and
even
granting
it
were
a
virtue
it
is
not
possible
to
kings
not
as
long
as
people
continue
to
fawn
on
royalty
like
grovelling
curs
and
lick
the
sceptred
hand
that
often
loathes
their
abject
touch
he
spoke
with
a
certain
bitterness
and
impatience
as
though
he
were
suffering
from
some
inward
nervous
irritation
and
theos
observing
this
prudently
made
no
attempt
to
continue
the
conversation
they
were
just
then
passing
down
a
narrow
rather
dark
street
lined
on
both
sides
by
lofty
buildings
of
quaint
and
elaborate
architecture
long
gloomy
shadows
had
gathered
in
this
particular
spot
where
for
a
short
space
the
silence
was
so
intense
that
one
could
almost
hear
one
own
heart
beat
suddenly
a
ray
of
light
flashed
across
the
pavement
and
lo
the
upper
rim
of
the
moon
peered
above
the
looking
strangely
large
and
rosily
brilliant
the
air
seemed
all
at
once
to
grow
suffocating
and
sulphurous
and
between
whiles
there
came
the
faint
plashing
sound
of
water
lapping
against
stone
with
a
monotonous
murmur
as
of
continuous
soft
whispers
the
vast
silence
the
vast
night
were
full
of
a
solemn
weirdness
the
moon
curiously
magnified
to
twice
her
ordinary
size
soared
higher
and
higher
firing
the
lofty
solitudes
of
heaven
with
long
shooting
radiations
of
rose
and
green
while
still
in
the
purple
hollow
of
the
horizon
lay
that
immense
immovable
cloud
nerved
as
it
were
with
living
lightning
which
leaped
incessantly
from
its
centre
like
a
thousand
swords
drawn
and
from
as
many
scabbards
presently
the
deep
booming
noise
of
a
great
bell
smote
heavily
on
the
stillness
a
sound
that
theos
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
unutterable
forebodings
welcomed
with
a
vague
sense
of
relief
while
hearing
it
quickened
his
pace
they
soon
reached
the
end
of
the
street
which
terminated
in
a
spacious
quadrangular
court
guarded
on
all
sides
by
gigantic
black
statues
and
quickly
crossing
this
place
which
was
entirely
deserted
they
came
out
at
once
into
a
dazzling
blaze
of
light
the
temple
of
nagaya
in
all
its
stately
magnificence
towered
before
them
a
stupendous
pile
of
marvellously
delicate
architecture
so
fine
as
to
seem
like
rather
than
stone
it
was
lit
up
from
base
to
summit
with
glittering
lamps
of
all
colors
the
twelve
revolving
stars
on
its
twelve
tall
turrets
cast
forth
wide
beams
of
penetrating
radiance
into
the
deepening
darkness
of
the
night
aloft
in
its
topmost
crown
of
pinnacles
swung
the
bell
while
the
enormous
crowds
swarming
thick
about
it
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
brilliant
pharos
set
in
the
midst
of
a
surging
sea
the
steps
leading
up
to
it
were
strewn
with
flowers
the
doors
stood
open
and
a
thunderous
hum
of
solemn
music
vibrated
in
pulsations
through
the
heavy
heated
air
half
blinded
by
the
extreme
effulgence
and
confused
by
the
jostling
to
and
fro
of
a
multitude
immeasurably
greater
than
any
he
had
ever
seen
or
imagined
theos
instinctively
stretched
out
his
hand
in
the
helpless
fashion
of
one
not
knowing
whither
next
to
turn
immediately
caught
it
in
his
own
and
hurried
him
along
without
saying
a
word
how
they
managed
to
glide
through
the
close
ranks
of
pushing
pressing
people
and
effect
an
entrance
he
never
knew
but
when
he
recovered
from
his
momentary
dazed
bewilderment
he
found
himself
inside
the
temple
standing
near
a
pillar
of
finely
fluted
white
marble
that
shot
up
like
the
stem
of
a
and
lost
its
final
point
in
the
dim
yet
sparkling
splendor
of
the
immense
dome
above
lights
twinkled
everywhere
there
was
the
odor
of
faint
perfumes
mingled
with
the
fresher
fragrance
of
flowers
there
were
distant
glimpses
of
jewelled
shrines
and
the
leering
faces
of
grotesque
idols
clothed
in
draperies
of
amber
purple
and
green
and
between
the
multitudinous
columns
that
ringed
the
superb
fane
with
snowy
circles
one
within
the
other
hung
glittering
lamps
set
with
rare
gems
and
swinging
by
long
chains
of
gold
but
the
crowning
splendor
of
the
whole
was
concentrated
on
the
place
of
the
secret
inner
shrine
there
an
arch
of
fire
spanned
the
dome
from
left
to
right
there
from
huge
bronze
vessels
mounted
on
tall
tripods
the
smoke
of
burning
incense
arose
in
thick
and
odorous
clouds
there
children
clad
in
white
and
wearing
garlands
of
vivid
scarlet
blossoms
stood
about
in
little
groups
as
still
as
exquisitely
modelled
statuettes
their
small
hands
folded
and
their
eyes
downcast
there
the
steps
were
strewn
with
branches
of
palm
flowering
oleander
and
but
the
sanctuary
itself
was
not
visible
before
that
holy
of
holies
hung
the
dazzling
folds
of
the
silver
veil
a
curtain
of
the
most
wonderfully
woven
silver
tissue
that
seen
in
the
flashing
azure
light
of
the
luminous
arch
above
it
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
suddenly
frozen
sheet
of
foam
across
it
was
emblazoned
in
large
characters
i
am
the
past
the
present
the
future
the
and
the
the
ever
and
the
never
no
mortal
knoweth
my
name
as
theos
with
some
difficulty
owing
to
the
intense
brilliancy
of
the
veil
managed
to
decipher
these
words
he
heard
a
solitary
trumpet
sounded
a
note
that
echoed
itself
many
times
among
the
lofty
arches
before
it
finally
floated
into
silence
recognizing
this
as
an
evident
signal
for
some
new
and
important
phase
in
the
proceedings
he
turned
his
eyes
away
from
the
place
of
the
shrine
and
looking
round
the
building
was
surprised
to
see
how
completely
the
vast
area
was
filled
with
crowds
upon
crowds
of
silent
and
expectant
people
it
seemed
as
though
not
the
smallest
wedge
could
have
been
inserted
between
the
shoulders
of
one
man
and
another
yet
where
he
stood
with
there
was
plenty
of
room
the
reason
of
this
however
was
soon
apparent
they
were
in
the
place
reserved
for
the
king
and
the
immediate
officers
of
the
royal
household
and
scarcely
had
the
sweet
vibration
of
that
clear
died
away
when
zephoranim
himself
appeared
walking
slowly
and
majestically
in
the
midst
of
a
select
company
of
his
nobles
and
courtiers
he
wore
the
simple
white
garb
of
an
ordinary
citizen
of
together
with
a
silver
belt
and
dagger
not
a
jewel
relieved
the
classic
severity
of
his
costume
and
not
even
the
merest
fillet
of
gold
in
his
rough
dark
hair
denoted
his
royal
rank
but
the
pride
of
precedence
spoke
in
his
flashing
eyes
the
arrogance
of
authority
in
the
poise
of
his
figure
and
haughtiness
of
his
step
his
brows
were
knitted
in
something
of
a
frown
and
his
face
looked
pale
and
slightly
careworn
he
spied
out
at
once
and
smiled
kindly
there
was
not
a
trace
of
coldness
in
his
manner
toward
his
favored
minstrel
and
theos
noted
this
with
a
curious
sense
of
sudden
consolation
and
encouragement
why
should
i
have
feared
zephoranim
he
thought
has
no
greater
friend
except
myself
the
king
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
do
him
any
injury
just
then
a
magnificent
burst
of
triumphal
music
rolled
through
the
temple
the
music
of
some
mighty
instrument
in
sound
but
several
tones
deeper
than
the
grandest
organ
ever
made
mingled
with
children
voices
singing
the
king
seated
himself
on
a
cushioned
chair
directly
in
front
of
the
silver
veil
took
a
place
at
his
right
hand
giving
theos
a
low
bench
close
beside
him
while
the
various
distinguished
personages
who
had
attended
zephoranim
disposed
themselves
indifferently
wherever
they
could
find
only
keeping
as
near
to
their
monarch
as
they
were
able
to
do
in
the
extreme
pressure
of
so
vast
a
congregation
for
now
every
available
inch
of
space
was
occupied
as
far
as
eye
could
see
there
were
rows
upon
rows
of
men
and
women
theos
imagined
there
must
have
been
more
then
five
thousand
people
present
on
went
the
huge
pulsations
of
melody
surging
through
the
air
like
waves
thudding
incessantly
on
a
rocky
shore
and
presently
out
of
a
side
archway
near
the
came
with
slow
and
gliding
noiselessness
a
band
of
priests
walking
two
by
two
and
carrying
branches
of
palm
these
were
all
clad
in
purple
and
crowned
with
they
marched
sedately
keeping
their
eyes
lowered
while
their
lips
moved
constantly
as
though
they
muttered
inaudible
incantations
waving
their
to
and
fro
they
paced
along
past
the
king
and
down
the
centre
aisle
of
the
temple
then
turning
they
came
back
again
to
the
lowest
step
of
the
shrine
and
there
they
all
prostrated
themselves
while
the
children
who
stood
near
the
flung
fresh
perfumes
on
the
glowing
embers
and
chanted
the
following
recitative
o
nagaya
great
everlasting
and
terrible
thou
who
dost
wind
thy
coils
of
wisdom
into
the
heart
thou
whose
eyes
waking
and
sleeping
do
behold
all
things
thou
who
art
the
joy
of
the
sun
and
the
master
of
virgins
hear
us
we
beseech
thee
when
we
call
upon
thy
name
their
young
treble
voices
were
clear
and
piercing
and
pealed
up
to
the
dome
to
fall
again
like
the
drops
of
distinct
round
melody
from
a
lark
and
when
they
ceased
there
came
a
short
impressive
pause
the
silver
veil
quivered
from
end
to
end
as
though
swayed
by
a
faint
wind
and
the
flaming
arch
above
turned
from
pale
blue
to
a
strange
shimmering
green
then
in
mellow
unison
the
kneeling
priests
intoned
o
thou
who
givest
words
of
power
to
the
dumb
mouth
of
the
soul
in
hades
hear
us
nagaya
o
thou
who
openest
the
grave
and
givest
peace
to
the
heart
plead
for
us
nagaya
o
thou
who
art
companion
of
the
sun
and
controller
of
the
east
and
of
the
west
comfort
us
nagaya
here
they
ended
and
the
children
began
again
not
to
chant
but
to
a
strange
and
tristful
tune
wilder
than
any
that
vragrant
winds
could
play
on
the
strings
of
an
aeolian
lyre
o
virgin
of
virgins
holy
maid
to
what
shall
we
resemble
thee
chaste
daughter
of
the
sun
how
shall
we
praise
thy
peerless
beauty
thou
art
the
gate
of
the
house
of
stars
thou
art
the
first
of
the
seven
jewels
of
nagaya
thou
dost
wield
the
sceptre
of
ebony
and
the
eye
of
raphon
beholds
thee
with
love
and
contentment
thou
art
the
chiefest
of
women
thou
hast
the
secrets
of
earth
and
heaven
thou
knowest
the
dark
mysteries
hail
lysia
queen
of
the
hall
of
judgment
hail
pure
pearl
in
the
sea
of
the
sun
glory
declare
unto
us
we
beseech
thee
the
will
of
nagaya
they
closed
this
canticle
softly
and
slowly
then
flinging
themselves
prone
they
pressed
their
faces
to
the
earth
and
again
the
glittering
veil
waved
to
and
fro
suggestively
while
theos
his
heart
beating
fast
watched
its
shining
woof
with
straining
eyes
and
a
sense
of
suffocation
in
his
throat
what
ignorant
fools
what
mad
barbarians
what
blind
blasphemers
were
these
people
he
indignantly
thought
who
could
thus
patiently
hear
the
praise
of
an
evil
woman
like
lysia
publicly
proclaimed
with
almost
divine
honors
did
they
actually
intend
to
worship
her
he
wondered
if
so
he
at
any
rate
would
never
bend
the
knee
to
one
so
vile
he
might
have
done
so
once
perhaps
but
now
at
that
instant
a
flute
like
murmur
of
melody
crept
upward
as
it
seemed
from
the
ground
with
a
plaintive
whispering
sweetness
like
the
lament
of
some
exiled
fairy
so
exquisitely
tender
and
pathetic
and
yet
withal
so
and
passionate
that
despite
himself
he
listened
with
a
strange
swooning
sense
of
languor
stealing
insidiously
over
him
a
dreamy
lassitude
that
while
it
made
him
feel
enervated
and
deprived
of
strength
was
still
not
altogether
unpleasing
a
faint
sigh
escaped
his
lips
and
he
kept
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
silver
veil
as
pertinaciously
as
though
behind
it
lay
the
mystery
of
his
soul
ruin
or
salvation
how
the
light
flashed
on
its
shimmering
folds
like
the
rippling
phosphorescence
on
southern
seas
as
green
and
clear
and
brilliant
as
rays
reflected
from
thousands
and
thousands
of
glistening
emeralds
and
that
haunting
sorrowful
weird
music
how
it
seemed
to
eat
into
his
heart
and
there
waken
a
bitter
remorse
combined
with
an
equally
bitter
despair
once
more
the
veil
moved
and
this
time
it
appeared
to
inflate
itself
in
the
fashion
of
a
sail
caught
by
a
sudden
breeze
then
it
began
to
part
in
the
middle
very
slowly
and
without
sound
further
and
further
back
on
each
side
it
gradually
receded
and
like
a
lily
disclosed
between
folding
leaves
a
figure
white
wonderful
and
angelically
fair
shone
out
the
centre
jewel
of
the
stately
shrine
a
shrine
whose
immense
carven
pillars
grotesque
idols
bronze
and
gold
ornaments
jewelled
lamps
and
dazzling
embroideries
only
served
as
a
sort
of
background
to
intensify
with
a
more
lustrous
charm
the
statuesque
loveliness
revealed
o
lysia
unvirgined
priestess
of
the
sun
and
nagaya
how
gloriously
art
thou
arrayed
in
sin
o
singular
sweetness
whose
end
must
needs
be
destruction
was
ever
woman
fairer
than
thou
o
love
love
lost
in
the
dead
and
drowned
in
the
uttermost
darkness
of
things
evil
wilt
thou
drag
my
soul
with
thee
again
into
everlasting
night
thus
theos
inwardly
raved
without
any
real
comprehension
of
his
own
thoughts
but
only
stricken
anew
by
a
feverish
passion
of
mingled
love
and
hatred
as
he
stared
on
the
witching
sorceress
whose
marvellous
beauty
was
such
wonder
and
torture
to
his
eyes
what
mattered
it
to
him
that
king
laureate
and
people
had
all
prostrated
themselves
before
her
in
reverent
humility
he
knew
her
nature
he
had
fathomed
her
inborn
wickedness
and
though
his
senses
were
attracted
by
her
his
spirit
loathingly
repelled
her
he
therefore
remained
seated
stiffly
upright
watching
her
with
a
sort
of
passive
immovable
intentness
as
she
now
appeared
before
him
her
loveliness
was
absolutely
and
ideally
perfect
she
looked
the
embodiment
of
all
grace
the
model
of
all
chastity
she
stood
quite
still
her
hands
folded
on
her
breast
her
head
slightly
lifted
her
dark
eyes
upturned
her
unbound
black
hair
streamed
over
her
shoulders
in
loose
glossy
waves
and
above
her
brows
her
diadem
of
serpents
heads
sparkled
like
a
coronal
of
flame
her
robe
was
white
made
of
some
silky
shining
stuff
that
glistened
with
soft
pearly
hues
it
was
gathered
about
her
waist
by
a
twisted
golden
girdle
her
arms
were
bare
decked
as
before
with
the
small
jewelled
snakes
that
coiled
upward
from
wrist
to
shoulder
and
when
after
a
brief
pause
she
unfolded
her
hands
and
raised
them
with
a
slow
majestic
movement
above
her
head
the
great
symbolic
eye
flared
from
her
bosom
like
a
darting
coal
seeming
to
turn
sinister
glances
on
all
sides
as
though
on
the
search
for
some
suspected
foe
fortunately
no
one
appeared
to
notice
theos
deliberate
of
the
homage
due
to
her
no
one
lysia
herself
she
met
the
open
defiance
scorn
and
reluctant
admiration
of
his
glance
and
a
cold
smile
dawned
on
her
features
a
smile
more
dreadful
in
its
very
sweetness
than
any
frown
then
turning
away
her
beautiful
fathomless
slumberous
eyes
and
still
keeping
her
arms
raised
she
lifted
up
her
voice
a
voice
mellow
as
a
golden
flute
that
pierced
the
silence
with
a
straight
arrow
of
pure
sound
and
chanted
give
glory
to
the
sun
o
ye
people
for
his
light
doth
illumine
your
darkness
and
the
murmur
of
the
mighty
crowd
surged
back
in
answer
we
give
him
glory
here
came
a
brief
clash
of
brazen
bells
and
when
the
clamor
ceased
lysia
continued
give
glory
to
the
moon
o
ye
people
for
she
is
the
servant
of
the
sun
and
the
ruler
of
the
house
of
sleep
again
the
people
responded
we
give
her
glory
and
again
the
bells
jangled
tempestuously
give
glory
to
nagaya
o
ye
people
for
he
alone
can
turn
aside
the
wrath
of
the
immortals
we
give
him
glory
rejoined
the
multitude
and
we
give
him
glory
seemed
to
be
shouted
high
among
the
arches
of
the
temple
with
a
strange
sound
as
of
the
mocking
laughter
of
devils
this
preliminary
over
there
came
out
of
unseen
doors
on
both
sides
of
the
sanctuary
twenty
priests
in
companies
of
ten
each
ten
advancing
from
the
left
ten
from
the
right
these
were
clad
in
flowing
garments
of
silk
heavily
bordered
with
gold
and
the
leader
of
the
group
was
the
priest
zel
his
demeanor
was
austere
and
dignified
he
carried
a
square
cushion
covered
in
black
on
which
lay
a
long
thin
knife
with
a
jewelled
hilt
the
chief
of
the
priests
who
stood
on
the
left
bore
a
very
tall
and
massive
staff
of
polished
ebony
which
he
solemnly
presented
to
the
high
priestess
who
grasped
it
firmly
in
one
slight
hand
and
allowed
it
to
rest
steadily
on
the
ground
while
its
uppermost
point
reached
far
above
her
head
then
followed
the
strangest
weirdest
scene
that
even
the
pen
of
poets
or
brush
of
painter
devised
a
march
round
and
round
the
temple
of
all
the
priests
bearing
lighted
flambeaux
and
singing
in
chorus
a
wild
litany
a
confused
medley
of
supplications
to
the
sun
and
nagaya
which
accompanied
as
it
was
by
the
discordant
beating
drums
and
the
clanging
of
bells
had
an
evidently
powerful
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
assembled
populace
for
presently
they
also
joined
in
the
maddening
chant
and
growing
more
and
more
possessed
by
the
contagious
fever
of
fanaticism
began
to
howl
and
shriek
and
clap
their
hands
furiously
creating
a
frightful
din
suggestive
of
some
fiendish
clamor
in
hell
theos
half
deafened
by
the
horrible
uproar
as
well
as
roused
to
an
abnormal
pitch
of
restless
excitement
looked
round
to
see
how
comported
himself
he
was
sitting
quite
still
in
a
perfectly
composed
attitude
a
faint
derisive
smile
played
on
his
lips
his
profile
as
it
just
then
appeared
had
the
firmness
and
the
pure
soft
outline
of
a
delicately
finished
cameo
his
splendid
eyes
now
darkened
now
lightened
with
passion
as
he
gazed
at
lysia
who
all
alone
in
the
centre
of
the
shrine
held
her
ebony
staff
as
perpendicularly
erect
as
though
it
were
a
tree
rooted
fathoms
deep
in
earth
keeping
herself
too
as
motionless
as
a
figure
of
frozen
snow
and
the
king
what
of
him
glancing
at
that
brooding
countenance
theos
was
startled
and
at
the
same
time
half
fascinated
by
its
expression
such
a
mixture
of
tigerish
tenderness
servile
idolatry
intemperate
desire
and
craven
fear
he
had
never
seen
delineated
on
the
face
of
any
human
being
in
the
black
thirsty
eyes
there
was
a
look
that
spoke
volumes
a
look
that
betrayed
what
the
heart
concealed
and
reading
that
featured
emblazonment
of
hidden
guilt
theos
knew
beyond
all
doubt
that
the
rumors
concerning
the
high
priestess
and
the
king
were
true
that
the
dead
khosrul
had
spoken
rightly
that
zephoranim
loved
lysia
love
it
seemed
too
tame
a
word
for
the
fury
of
passion
that
visibly
and
violently
consumed
the
man
what
would
be
the
result
when
the
high
priestess
is
the
king
mistress
then
fall
these
foolish
doggerel
lines
why
did
they
suggest
themselves
they
meant
nothing
the
question
did
not
concern
at
all
let
the
city
stand
or
fall
as
it
list
who
cared
so
long
as
escaped
injury
such
at
least
was
the
tenor
of
theos
thoughts
as
he
rapidly
began
to
calculate
certain
contingencies
that
now
seemed
likely
to
occur
if
for
instance
the
king
were
made
aware
of
intrigue
with
lysia
would
not
his
rage
and
jealousy
exceed
all
bounds
and
if
on
the
other
hand
were
convinced
of
the
king
passion
for
the
same
fatally
fair
traitress
would
not
his
wrath
and
injured
overbear
all
loyalty
and
prudence
and
between
the
two
powerful
rivals
who
thus
by
stealth
enjoyed
her
capricious
favors
what
would
lysia
own
decision
be
like
a
loud
hissing
in
his
ears
he
heard
again
the
murderous
command
a
command
which
was
half
a
menace
kill
faint
shudders
as
of
icy
cold
ran
through
him
he
nerved
himself
to
meet
some
deadly
evil
though
he
could
not
guess
what
that
evil
might
be
he
was
willing
to
throw
away
all
the
past
that
haunted
him
and
cut
off
all
hope
of
a
future
provided
he
could
only
baffle
the
snares
of
the
pitiless
beauty
to
whom
the
torture
of
men
was
an
evident
joy
and
rescue
his
beloved
and
gifted
friend
from
her
perilous
attraction
making
a
strong
effort
to
master
the
inward
conflict
of
fear
and
pain
that
tormented
him
he
turned
his
attention
anew
to
the
gorgeous
ceremony
that
was
going
on
the
march
of
the
priests
had
come
to
an
abrupt
end
they
stood
now
on
each
side
of
the
shrine
divided
in
groups
of
equal
numbers
tossing
their
flambeaux
around
and
above
them
to
the
measured
ringing
of
bells
at
every
upward
wave
of
these
flaring
torches
a
tongue
of
fire
leaped
aloft
to
instantly
break
and
descend
in
a
sparkling
shower
of
gold
the
effect
of
this
was
wonderful
in
the
extreme
as
by
the
dexterous
way
in
which
the
flames
were
flung
forth
it
appeared
to
the
spectator
eyes
as
though
a
luminous
snake
were
twisting
and
coiling
itself
to
and
fro
in
all
loud
music
ceased
the
multitude
calmed
down
by
degrees
and
left
off
their
delirious
cries
of
frenzy
or
rapture
there
was
nothing
heard
but
a
monotonous
chanting
in
undertone
of
which
not
a
syllable
was
distinctly
intelligible
then
from
out
a
dark
portal
unperceived
in
the
shadowed
gloom
of
a
curtained
niche
there
advanced
a
procession
of
young
girls
fifty
in
all
clad
in
pure
white
and
closely
veiled
they
carried
small
citherns
and
arriving
in
front
of
the
shrine
they
knelt
down
in
a
semicircle
and
very
gently
began
to
strike
the
short
responsive
strings
the
murmur
of
a
lazy
rivulet
among
whispering
reeds
the
sighing
suggestions
of
leaves
ready
to
fall
in
autumn
the
low
languid
trilling
of
nightingales
just
learning
to
sing
any
or
all
these
might
be
said
to
resemble
the
dulcet
melody
they
played
while
every
delicate
arpeggio
every
rippling
chord
was
muffled
with
a
soft
pressure
of
their
hands
ere
the
sound
had
time
to
become
vehement
this
harping
continued
for
a
short
interval
during
which
the
priests
gathering
in
a
ring
round
a
huge
bronze
vessel
hard
by
dipped
their
flambeaux
therein
and
suddenly
extinguished
them
at
the
same
moment
the
lights
in
the
body
of
the
temple
were
all
lowered
only
the
arch
spanning
the
shrine
blazed
in
undiminished
brilliancy
its
green
tint
appearing
more
intense
in
contrast
with
the
surrounding
deepening
shadow
and
now
with
a
harsh
clanging
noise
as
of
the
turning
of
heavy
bolts
and
keys
the
back
of
the
sanctuary
parted
asunder
in
the
fashion
of
a
revolving
double
doorway
and
a
golden
grating
was
disclosed
its
strong
glistening
bars
welded
together
like
knotted
ropes
and
wrought
with
marvellous
finish
and
solidity
turning
toward
this
semblance
of
a
lysia
spoke
aloud
her
clear
tones
floating
with
mellifluous
slowness
above
the
quiverings
of
the
come
forth
o
nagaya
thou
who
didst
slumber
in
the
bosom
of
space
ere
ever
the
world
was
made
come
forth
o
nagaya
thou
who
didst
behold
the
sun
born
out
of
chaos
and
the
earth
enriched
with
life
come
forth
o
nagaya
friend
of
the
gods
and
the
people
and
comfort
us
with
the
divine
silence
of
thy
wisdom
supernal
while
she
pronounced
these
words
the
golden
grating
ascended
gradually
inch
by
inch
with
the
steady
clank
as
of
the
upward
winding
of
a
chain
and
when
she
ceased
there
came
a
mysterious
rustling
slippery
sound
suggestive
of
some
creeping
thing
forcing
its
way
through
wet
and
tangled
grass
or
over
dead
leaves
one
instant
more
and
a
huge
serpent
a
species
of
python
some
ten
feet
in
length
glided
through
the
round
aperture
made
by
the
lifted
bars
and
writhed
itself
slowly
along
the
marble
pavement
straight
to
where
lysia
stood
once
it
stopped
curving
back
its
glistening
body
in
a
strange
loop
as
though
in
readiness
to
spring
but
it
soon
resumed
its
course
and
arrived
at
the
high
priestess
feet
there
its
whole
frame
trembled
and
glowed
with
extraordinary
radiance
the
prevailing
color
of
its
skin
was
creamy
white
marked
with
countless
rings
and
scaly
bright
spots
of
silver
purple
and
a
peculiar
livid
blue
and
all
these
tints
came
into
brilliant
prominence
as
it
crouched
before
lysia
and
twisted
its
sinuous
neck
to
and
fro
with
an
evidently
fawning
and
supplicatory
gesture
while
she
keeping
her
sombre
dark
eyes
fixed
full
upon
it
moved
not
an
inch
from
her
position
but
majestically
serene
continued
to
hold
the
tall
staff
of
ebony
straight
and
erect
as
a
growing
palm
the
had
now
the
soothing
softness
of
a
mother
lullaby
to
a
tired
child
and
as
the
liquid
notes
quavered
delicately
on
the
otherwise
deep
stillness
the
formidable
reptile
began
to
coil
itself
ascendingly
round
and
round
the
ebony
rod
higher
and
higher
one
glistening
ring
after
another
higher
still
till
its
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
the
eye
of
raphon
that
flamed
on
lysia
breast
there
it
paused
in
apparent
reflectiveness
and
seemed
to
listen
to
the
slumberous
strains
that
floated
toward
it
in
breaths
of
sound
then
starting
afresh
on
its
upward
way
it
carefully
and
with
almost
human
tenderness
avoided
touching
lysia
hand
which
now
rested
on
the
staff
between
two
thick
twists
of
its
body
and
finally
it
reached
the
top
where
fully
raising
its
crested
head
it
displayed
the
prismatic
tints
of
its
soft
restless
wavy
throat
which
was
adorned
furthermore
by
a
flexible
circlet
of
magnificent
diamonds
nothing
more
striking
or
more
singular
could
theos
imagine
than
the
scene
now
before
him
the
beautiful
woman
still
as
sculptured
marble
and
the
palpitating
snake
coiled
on
that
rod
and
uplifted
above
her
while
round
the
twain
knelt
the
priests
their
faces
covered
in
their
robes
and
from
all
parts
of
the
temple
the
loud
shout
arose
all
hail
nagaya
praise
honor
and
glory
be
unto
thee
forever
and
ever
then
it
was
that
the
proud
king
flung
himself
to
earth
and
kissed
the
dust
in
abject
submission
then
carelessly
complaisant
bent
the
knee
and
smiled
to
himself
mockingly
as
he
performed
the
act
of
veneration
then
the
enormous
multitude
with
clasped
hands
and
beseeching
looks
fell
down
and
worshipped
the
glittering
beast
of
the
field
whose
shining
curiously
sad
eyes
roved
hither
and
thither
with
a
darting
yet
melancholy
eagerness
over
all
the
people
who
called
it
lord
to
theos
imagination
it
looked
a
creature
more
sorrowful
than
fierce
a
poor
charmed
brute
that
while
netted
in
the
drowsy
woofs
of
its
mistress
lysia
magnetic
spell
seemed
as
though
it
dimly
wondered
why
it
should
thus
be
raised
aloft
for
the
adoration
of
infatuated
humankind
its
brilliant
crest
quivered
and
emitted
little
arrowy
scintillations
of
lustre
the
god
was
ill
at
ease
in
the
midst
of
all
his
splendor
and
two
or
three
times
bent
back
his
gleaming
neck
as
though
desirous
of
descending
to
the
level
ground
but
when
these
hints
of
rebellion
declared
themselves
in
the
tremors
running
through
the
scaly
twists
of
his
body
lysia
looked
up
and
at
once
compelled
as
it
were
by
involuntary
attraction
nagaya
the
divine
looked
down
the
strange
subtle
mesmeric
sleepy
eyes
of
the
woman
met
the
glittering
green
mournful
eyes
of
the
snake
and
thus
the
two
beautiful
creatures
regarded
each
other
steadfastly
and
with
an
apparent
vague
sympathy
till
the
deity
evidently
overcome
by
a
stronger
will
than
his
own
and
resigning
himself
to
the
inevitable
twisted
his
radiant
head
back
again
to
the
top
of
the
ebony
staff
and
again
surveyed
the
kneeling
crowds
of
worshippers
presently
his
glistening
jaws
opened
his
tongue
darted
forth
vibratingly
and
he
gave
vent
to
a
low
hissing
sound
erecting
and
depressing
his
crest
with
extraordinary
rapidity
so
that
it
flashed
like
an
aigrette
of
rare
gems
then
with
slow
and
solemn
step
the
priest
zel
advanced
to
the
front
of
the
shrine
and
spreading
out
his
hands
in
the
manner
of
one
pronouncing
a
benediction
said
loudly
and
with
emphasis
nagaya
the
divine
doth
hear
the
prayers
of
his
people
nagaya
the
supreme
doth
accept
the
offered
sacrifice
bring
forth
the
victim
the
last
words
were
spoken
with
stern
authoritativeness
and
scarcely
had
they
been
uttered
when
the
great
entrance
doors
of
the
temple
flew
open
and
a
procession
of
children
appeared
strewing
flowers
and
singing
o
happy
bride
we
bring
thee
unto
joy
and
peace
to
thee
are
opened
the
palaces
of
the
air
the
beautiful
silent
palaces
where
the
bright
stars
dwell
o
happy
bride
of
nagaya
how
fair
a
fate
is
thine
pausing
they
flung
wreaths
and
garlands
among
the
people
and
continued
o
happy
bride
for
thee
are
past
all
sorrows
and
sin
thou
shalt
never
know
shame
or
pain
or
grief
or
the
weariness
of
tears
for
thee
no
husband
shall
prove
false
no
children
prove
ungrateful
o
happy
bride
of
nagaya
how
glad
a
fate
is
thine
o
happy
bride
when
thou
art
wedded
to
the
beautiful
god
the
god
of
rest
thou
shalt
forget
all
trouble
and
dwell
among
sweet
dreams
for
ever
thou
art
the
blessed
one
chosen
for
the
of
nagaya
o
happy
bride
how
glorious
a
fate
is
thine
thus
they
sang
in
the
soft
strange
of
and
tripped
along
with
that
innocent
unthinking
gayety
usual
to
such
young
creatures
up
to
the
centre
aisle
toward
the
sanctuary
they
were
followed
by
four
priests
in
scarlet
robes
and
closely
masked
and
walking
steadfastly
between
these
came
a
slim
girl
clad
in
white
veiled
from
head
to
foot
and
crowned
with
a
wreath
of
lotus
lilies
all
the
congregation
as
though
moved
by
an
impulse
turned
to
look
at
her
as
she
passed
but
her
features
were
not
as
yet
discernible
through
the
draperies
that
enfolded
her
the
singing
children
always
preceding
her
and
scattering
flowers
having
arrived
at
the
steps
of
the
shrine
grouped
themselves
on
either
side
and
the
red
garmented
priests
after
having
made
several
genuflections
to
the
glittering
python
that
now
with
reared
neck
and
quivering
fangs
seemed
to
watch
everything
that
was
going
on
with
absorbed
and
crafty
vigilance
proceeded
to
unveil
the
maiden
martyr
and
also
to
tie
her
slight
hands
behind
her
back
by
means
of
a
knotted
silver
cord
then
in
a
firm
voice
the
priest
zel
proclaimed
behold
the
elected
bride
of
the
sun
and
the
divine
nagaya
she
bears
away
from
the
city
the
burden
of
your
sins
o
ye
people
and
by
her
death
the
gods
are
satisfied
rejoice
greatly
for
ye
are
absolved
and
by
the
silver
veil
and
the
eye
of
raphon
we
pronounce
upon
all
here
present
the
blessing
of
pardon
and
peace
as
he
spoke
the
girl
turned
round
as
though
in
obedience
to
some
mechanical
impulse
and
fully
confronted
the
multitude
her
pale
pure
face
framed
in
a
shining
aureole
of
rippling
fair
hair
floated
before
theos
bewildered
eyes
like
a
vision
seen
indistinctly
in
a
magic
crystal
and
he
was
for
a
moment
uncertain
of
her
identity
but
quick
as
a
flash
glance
lighted
upon
her
and
with
a
cry
of
horror
that
sent
desolate
echoes
through
and
through
the
arches
of
the
temple
he
started
from
his
seat
his
arms
outstretched
his
whole
frame
convulsed
and
quivering
niphrata
niphrata
and
his
rich
voice
shook
with
a
passion
of
appeal
o
ye
gods
what
mad
blind
murderous
cruelty
zephoranim
and
he
turned
impetuously
on
the
astonished
monarch
as
thou
livest
crowned
king
i
say
this
maid
is
mine
and
in
the
very
presence
of
nagaya
i
swear
she
shall
not
die
chapter
xxviii
the
sacrifice
a
solemn
silence
ensued
consternation
and
wrath
were
depicted
on
every
countenance
the
sacred
service
was
interrupted
a
defiance
had
been
hurled
as
it
were
in
the
very
teeth
of
the
god
nagaya
and
this
horrible
outrage
to
religion
and
law
had
been
actually
committed
by
the
laureate
of
the
realm
it
was
preposterous
incredible
and
the
gaping
crowds
reached
over
each
other
shoulders
to
stare
at
the
offender
pressing
forward
eager
wondering
startled
faces
which
to
theos
looked
far
more
spectral
than
real
seen
in
the
shimmering
green
radiance
that
was
thrown
flickering
upon
them
from
the
luminous
arch
above
the
altar
the
priests
stood
still
in
speechless
indignation
lysia
moved
not
at
all
nor
raised
her
eyes
only
her
lips
parted
in
a
very
slight
cold
smile
seized
with
mortal
dread
theos
gazed
helplessly
at
his
reckless
beautiful
poet
friend
who
with
head
erect
and
visage
white
as
a
waning
moon
haughtily
confronted
his
sovereign
and
audaciously
asserted
his
right
to
be
heard
even
in
the
holy
place
of
worship
the
king
was
the
first
to
break
the
breathless
stillness
his
words
came
harshly
from
his
throat
and
the
great
muscles
in
his
neck
seemed
to
swell
visibly
with
his
hardly
controlled
anger
peace
thou
art
suddenly
distraught
he
said
in
fierce
accents
how
darest
thou
uplift
thy
clamorous
tongue
thus
wantonly
before
nagaya
and
interrupt
the
progress
of
his
sacred
ritual
check
thy
mad
speech
if
ever
yonder
maid
were
thine
is
certain
she
is
thine
no
longer
she
hath
offered
herself
a
voluntary
sacrifice
and
the
gods
are
pleased
to
claim
what
thou
perchance
hast
failed
to
value
for
all
answer
flung
himself
desperately
at
the
feet
zephoranim
he
cried
again
i
tell
thee
she
is
mine
mine
as
truly
mine
as
love
can
make
her
oh
she
is
chaster
than
in
her
sweet
body
but
in
her
spirit
she
is
wedded
wedded
to
me
whom
thou
o
king
hast
ever
delighted
to
honor
and
now
must
i
kneel
to
thee
in
vain
thou
whose
victories
i
have
sung
whose
praises
i
have
chanted
in
burning
words
that
shall
carry
thy
name
forever
with
triumph
down
to
unborn
generations
wilt
thou
become
inglorious
a
warrior
stricken
strengthless
by
the
mummeries
of
priestcraft
the
juggleries
of
a
perishing
creed
thou
art
the
ruler
of
thou
and
thou
only
restore
to
me
this
innocent
that
has
scarcely
yet
begun
to
bloom
speak
but
the
word
and
she
is
saved
and
her
timely
rescue
shall
add
lustre
to
the
record
of
thy
noblest
deeds
his
matchless
voice
full
of
passionate
pulsations
exercised
for
a
moment
a
resistless
influence
and
magnetic
charm
the
king
lowering
brows
relaxed
and
a
gleam
of
pity
passed
like
light
across
his
countenance
instinctively
he
extended
his
hand
to
raise
from
his
humble
attitude
as
though
even
in
his
wrath
he
were
conscious
of
the
immense
intellectual
superiority
of
a
great
poet
to
ever
so
great
a
king
and
a
thrill
of
involuntary
compassion
seemed
at
the
same
time
to
run
sympathetically
through
the
vast
congregation
theos
drew
a
quick
breath
of
relief
and
glanced
at
niphrata
how
cold
and
unconcerned
was
her
demeanor
did
she
not
hear
pleading
in
her
behalf
no
matter
she
would
be
saved
he
thought
and
all
would
yet
be
well
and
truly
it
now
appeared
as
if
mercy
and
not
cruelty
were
to
be
the
order
of
the
hour
for
just
then
the
priest
zel
after
having
exchanged
a
few
inaudible
words
with
lysia
advanced
again
to
the
front
of
the
shrine
and
spoke
in
distinct
tones
of
forced
gentleness
and
bland
forbearance
hear
me
o
king
princes
and
people
whereas
it
has
unhappily
occurred
to
the
wonder
and
sorrow
of
many
that
the
holy
spouse
of
the
divine
nagaya
is
delayed
in
her
desired
departure
by
the
unforeseen
opposition
and
unedifying
contumacy
of
poet
laureate
of
this
realm
and
lest
it
may
be
perchance
imagined
by
the
uninitiated
that
the
maiden
is
in
any
way
unwilling
to
fulfil
her
glorious
destiny
the
high
and
immaculate
priestess
of
the
shrine
doth
bid
me
here
pronounce
a
respite
a
brief
interval
wherein
if
the
king
and
the
people
be
willing
he
who
is
named
shall
by
virtue
of
his
high
renown
be
permitted
to
address
the
and
ascertain
her
own
wishes
from
her
own
lips
injustice
can
not
dwell
within
this
sacred
temple
and
if
on
trial
the
maiden
chooses
the
transitory
joys
of
earth
in
preference
to
the
everlasting
joys
of
the
palaces
of
the
sun
then
in
nagaya
name
shall
she
go
free
inasmuch
as
the
god
loves
not
a
reluctant
bride
and
better
no
sacrifice
at
all
than
one
that
is
grudgingly
consummated
he
ceased
and
sprang
erect
his
eyes
sparkling
his
whole
demeanor
that
of
a
man
unexpectedly
disburdened
from
some
crushing
grief
thanks
be
unto
the
benevolent
destinies
he
exclaimed
flashing
a
quick
glance
of
gratitude
toward
lysia
the
statuesque
lysia
on
whose
delicately
curved
lips
the
faintly
derisive
smile
still
lingered
and
in
return
for
the
life
of
my
niphrata
i
will
give
a
thousand
jewels
rare
beyond
all
price
to
deck
nagaya
tabernacle
and
i
will
pour
libations
to
the
sun
for
twenty
days
and
nights
in
token
of
my
heart
requital
for
mercy
well
bestowed
stooping
he
kissed
the
king
hand
whereupon
at
a
sign
from
zel
one
of
the
priests
attired
in
scarlet
unfastened
niphrata
bound
hands
and
led
her
as
one
leads
a
blind
child
straight
up
to
where
and
theos
stood
close
beside
the
king
who
together
with
many
others
stared
curiously
upon
her
how
fixed
and
feverishly
brilliant
were
her
large
eyes
how
set
were
the
sensitive
lines
of
her
mouth
how
indifferent
she
seemed
how
totally
unaware
of
the
laureate
presence
the
priest
who
brought
her
retired
into
the
background
and
she
remained
where
he
left
her
quite
mute
and
motionless
oh
how
every
nerve
in
theos
body
throbbed
with
inexpressible
agony
as
he
beheld
her
thus
the
wildest
remorse
possessed
him
it
was
as
though
he
looked
on
the
dim
picture
of
a
ruin
which
he
himself
had
recklessly
wrought
and
he
could
have
groaned
aloud
in
the
horrible
vagueness
of
his
incomprehensible
despair
caught
the
girl
hand
and
peered
into
her
white
still
face
niphrata
he
said
in
a
tremulous
i
am
here
dost
thou
not
know
me
she
sighed
a
long
shivering
sigh
and
smiled
what
a
strange
wistful
dying
smile
it
was
but
she
made
no
answer
niphrata
continued
the
laureate
passionately
pressing
the
little
cold
fingers
that
lay
so
passively
in
his
look
at
me
i
have
come
to
save
thee
to
take
thee
home
again
home
to
thy
flowers
thy
birds
thy
harp
thy
pretty
chamber
with
its
curtained
nook
where
thy
friend
zoralin
waits
and
weeps
all
day
for
thee
o
ye
gods
how
weak
am
i
and
he
fiercely
dashed
away
the
drops
that
glistened
on
his
black
silky
lashes
come
with
me
sweet
one
he
resumed
tenderly
come
why
art
thou
thus
silent
thou
whose
voice
hath
many
a
time
outrivalled
the
music
of
the
nightingales
hast
thou
no
word
for
me
thy
lord
come
and
theos
struggling
to
repress
his
own
rising
tears
heard
his
friend
accents
sink
into
a
still
lower
more
caressing
cadence
thou
shalt
never
again
have
cause
for
grief
my
niphrata
never
we
will
never
part
listen
am
i
not
he
whom
thou
lovest
the
poor
child
set
mouth
trembled
her
beautiful
sad
eyes
gazed
at
him
uncomprehendingly
he
whom
i
love
is
not
here
she
said
in
tired
soft
tones
i
left
him
but
he
followed
me
and
now
he
waits
for
me
yonder
and
she
turned
resolutely
toward
the
sanctuary
as
though
compelled
to
do
so
by
some
powerful
mesmeric
attraction
see
you
not
how
fair
he
is
and
she
pointed
with
her
disengaged
hand
to
the
formidable
python
through
whose
huge
coils
ran
the
tremors
of
impatient
and
eager
breathing
how
tenderly
his
eyes
behold
me
those
eyes
that
i
have
worshipped
so
patiently
so
faithfully
and
yet
that
never
lightened
into
love
for
me
till
now
o
thou
more
than
beloved
how
beautiful
thou
art
my
adored
one
my
heart
idol
and
a
look
of
pale
exaltation
lightened
her
features
as
she
fixed
her
wistful
gaze
like
a
fascinated
bird
on
the
shadowy
recess
whence
the
serpent
had
emerged
there
there
thou
dost
rest
on
a
couch
of
fadeless
roses
how
softly
the
moonlight
enfolds
thee
with
a
radiance
as
of
outspread
wings
i
hear
thy
voice
charming
the
silence
thou
dost
call
me
by
my
name
o
once
poor
name
made
rich
by
thy
sweet
utterance
yes
my
beloved
i
am
ready
i
come
i
shall
die
in
thy
embraces
nay
i
shall
not
die
but
sleep
and
dream
a
dream
of
love
that
shall
last
forever
and
ever
no
more
sorrow
no
more
tears
no
more
heartsick
longings
here
she
stopped
in
her
incoherent
speech
and
strove
to
release
her
hand
from
her
blue
eyes
filling
with
infinite
anxiety
and
distress
i
pray
thee
good
stranger
she
entreated
with
touching
mildness
whosoever
thou
art
delay
me
not
but
let
me
go
i
am
but
a
poor
maid
on
whom
love
hath
at
last
taken
pity
be
gentle
therefore
and
hinder
me
not
on
my
way
to
i
have
waited
for
happiness
so
long
so
long
her
young
plaintive
voice
quavered
into
a
half
sob
and
again
she
endeavored
to
break
away
from
the
laureate
hold
but
he
overcome
by
the
excess
of
his
own
grief
and
agitation
seized
her
other
hand
and
drew
her
close
up
to
him
niphrata
niphrata
he
cried
despairingly
what
evil
hath
befallen
thee
where
is
thy
thy
memory
look
look
straight
in
these
eyes
of
mine
and
read
there
my
truth
and
tenderness
am
thine
own
thy
poet
thy
lover
thy
master
thy
slave
all
that
thou
wouldst
have
me
be
i
am
whither
wouldst
thou
wander
in
search
of
me
thou
hast
no
further
to
go
dear
heart
than
these
arms
thou
art
safe
with
me
my
singing
bird
come
me
lead
thee
hence
and
home
she
watched
him
while
he
spoke
with
a
strange
expression
of
distrust
and
uneasiness
then
by
a
violent
effort
she
wrenched
her
hands
from
his
clasp
and
stood
aloof
waving
him
back
with
an
eloquent
gesture
of
amazed
reproach
away
she
said
in
firm
accents
of
sweet
severity
thou
art
a
demon
that
dost
seek
to
tempt
my
soul
to
ruin
thou
and
she
lifted
her
head
with
a
movement
of
proud
nay
thou
mayst
wear
his
look
his
smile
thou
mayst
even
borrow
the
clear
of
his
eyes
but
i
tell
thee
thou
art
fiend
not
angel
and
i
will
not
follow
thee
into
the
tangled
ways
of
sin
oh
thou
knowest
not
the
meaning
of
true
love
thou
there
is
treachery
on
thy
lips
and
thy
tongue
is
trained
to
utter
honeyed
falsehood
methinks
thou
hast
wantonly
broken
many
a
faithful
heart
and
made
light
jest
of
many
a
betrayed
virgin
sorrow
and
thou
darest
to
call
thyself
my
poet
my
in
whom
there
is
no
guile
and
who
would
die
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
wound
the
frailest
soul
that
trusted
him
depart
from
me
thou
hypocrite
in
poet
guise
thou
cruel
phantom
of
my
love
back
to
that
darkness
where
thou
dost
belong
and
trouble
not
my
peace
recoiled
from
her
amazed
and
stupefied
theos
clenched
his
hands
together
in
a
sort
of
physical
effort
to
keep
down
the
storm
of
emotions
working
within
him
for
niphrata
words
burnt
into
his
brain
like
fire
well
too
well
he
understood
their
full
intensity
of
meaning
she
loved
the
ideal
the
of
her
own
pure
fancies
and
desires
not
the
real
man
as
he
was
with
all
his
haughty
egotism
vainglory
and
vice
vice
in
which
he
took
more
pride
than
shame
perhaps
she
had
never
known
him
in
his
actual
character
she
like
other
women
of
her
lofty
and
ardent
type
had
no
doubt
set
up
the
hero
of
her
life
as
a
god
in
the
shrine
of
her
own
holy
and
enthusiastic
imagination
and
had
there
endowed
him
with
resplendent
virtues
which
he
had
never
once
deemed
it
worth
his
while
to
practise
oh
the
loving
hearts
of
women
how
much
men
have
to
answer
for
when
they
voluntarily
break
these
clear
mirrors
of
affection
wherein
they
all
unworthy
have
been
for
a
time
reflected
with
all
the
warmth
and
color
of
an
innocently
adoring
passion
shining
about
them
like
the
prismatic
rays
in
a
vase
of
polished
crystal
to
niphrata
remained
as
a
sort
of
splendid
divinity
for
whom
no
devotion
was
too
vast
too
high
or
too
complete
better
oh
surely
far
better
that
she
should
die
in
her
beautiful
than
live
to
see
her
elected
idol
descend
to
his
true
level
and
openly
display
all
the
weaknesses
of
his
volatile
flippant
godless
sensual
yet
alas
most
fascinating
and
nature
a
nature
which
overflowing
as
it
was
with
potentialities
of
noble
deeds
yet
lacked
sufficient
intrinsic
faith
and
force
to
accomplish
them
this
thought
stung
theos
like
a
sharp
and
filled
him
with
a
strange
indescribable
penitence
and
he
stood
in
dumb
misery
remorsefully
eyeing
his
friend
consternation
disappointment
and
pained
bewilderment
without
being
able
to
offer
him
the
slightest
consolation
was
indeed
the
very
picture
of
dismay
if
he
had
never
suffered
in
his
life
before
surely
he
suffered
now
niphrata
the
tender
the
humbly
adoring
niphrata
positively
rejected
him
refused
to
recognize
his
actual
presence
and
turned
insanely
away
from
him
toward
some
whom
she
fancied
could
only
be
found
in
that
unexplored
country
bordered
by
the
cold
river
of
death
meanwhile
the
silence
in
the
temple
was
intense
the
priests
were
like
so
many
wax
figures
fastened
in
fixed
positions
the
king
leaning
slightly
forward
in
his
chair
had
the
appearance
of
a
massively
moulded
image
of
bronze
and
to
theos
overwrought
condition
of
mind
the
only
actually
living
things
present
seemed
to
be
the
monster
serpent
whose
scaly
folds
palpitated
visibly
in
the
strong
light
and
the
hideous
eye
of
raphon
that
blazed
on
lysia
breast
with
a
menacing
stare
as
of
a
wrathful
ghoul
all
at
once
a
flash
of
comprehension
lightened
the
laureate
sternly
perplexed
face
a
bitter
laugh
broke
from
his
lips
she
has
been
drugged
he
cried
fiercely
pointing
to
niphrata
white
and
rigid
form
poisoned
by
some
deadly
potion
devised
of
devils
to
twist
and
torture
the
quivering
centres
of
the
brain
accursed
work
will
none
undo
it
and
springing
forward
nearer
the
shrine
he
raised
his
angry
impassioned
eyes
to
the
dark
inscrutable
ones
of
the
high
priestess
who
met
his
troubled
look
with
serene
and
irresponsive
gravity
is
there
no
touch
of
human
pity
in
things
divine
no
mercy
in
the
icy
fate
that
rules
our
destinies
this
child
knows
naught
of
what
she
does
she
hath
been
led
astray
in
a
moment
of
excitement
and
religious
exaltation
her
mind
hath
lost
its
balance
her
thoughts
float
disconnectedly
on
a
sea
of
vague
illusions
ah
by
the
gods
i
understand
it
all
now
and
he
suddenly
threw
himself
on
his
knees
his
appealing
gaze
resting
not
on
the
but
on
the
lovely
countenance
of
lysia
fair
and
brilliant
as
a
summer
morn
with
a
certain
waving
light
of
triumph
about
it
like
the
reflected
radiance
of
sunbeams
she
is
under
the
influence
of
raphon
o
withering
madness
o
cureless
she
is
ruled
by
that
most
horrible
secret
force
unknown
as
yet
to
the
outer
world
of
men
and
she
hears
things
that
are
not
and
sees
what
has
no
existence
o
lysia
daughter
of
the
sun
i
do
beseech
thee
by
all
the
inborn
gentleness
of
womanhood
unwind
the
mystic
spell
a
serious
smile
of
feigned
sorrowful
compassion
parted
the
beautiful
lips
of
the
priestess
but
she
gave
no
word
or
sign
in
answer
and
the
weird
jewel
on
her
breast
at
that
moment
shot
forth
a
myriad
scintillations
as
of
pointed
sharp
steel
some
extraordinary
power
in
it
or
in
lysia
herself
was
manifestly
at
work
for
with
a
violent
start
rose
from
his
knees
and
staggered
helplessly
backward
one
hand
pressed
to
his
eyes
as
though
to
shut
out
some
blinding
blaze
of
lightning
he
seemed
to
be
vaguely
groping
his
way
to
his
former
place
beside
the
king
and
theos
seeing
this
quickly
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
thither
whispering
anxiously
the
while
what
ails
thee
the
laureate
turned
upon
him
a
bewildered
piteous
face
white
with
an
intensity
of
speechless
anguish
nothing
he
faltered
nothing
is
over
the
child
must
die
then
all
suddenly
the
hard
drawn
lines
of
his
countenance
relaxed
great
tears
gathered
in
his
eyes
and
fell
slowly
one
by
one
and
moving
aside
he
shrank
away
as
far
as
possible
into
the
shadow
cast
by
a
huge
column
close
o
niphrata
niphrata
theos
heard
him
say
in
a
voice
broken
by
why
do
i
love
thee
only
now
now
when
thou
art
lost
to
me
forever
the
king
looked
after
him
but
presently
paid
no
further
heed
to
his
distress
theos
however
kept
near
him
whispering
whatever
poor
suggestions
of
comfort
he
could
in
the
extremity
of
his
own
grief
devise
a
hopeless
task
for
to
all
his
offered
solace
made
but
the
one
reply
oh
let
me
weep
let
me
weep
for
the
untimely
death
of
innocence
and
now
the
which
had
ceased
commenced
again
accompanied
by
the
mysterious
thrilling
bass
notes
of
the
invisible
instrument
whose
sound
resembled
the
roll
and
rush
of
huge
billows
breaking
into
foam
as
the
rich
and
solemn
strains
swept
grandly
through
the
spacious
temple
niphrata
stretched
out
her
hands
toward
the
high
priestess
a
smile
of
wonderful
beauty
lighting
up
her
fair
take
me
o
ye
immortal
gods
she
cried
her
voice
ringing
in
clear
tune
above
all
the
other
take
me
and
bear
me
away
on
your
strong
swift
wings
to
the
everlasting
palaces
of
air
wherein
all
sorrows
have
end
and
patient
love
meets
at
last
its
reward
take
for
lo
i
am
ready
to
depart
my
soul
is
wounded
and
weary
of
its
prison
it
struggles
to
be
free
o
destiny
i
thank
thee
for
thy
mercy
i
praise
thee
for
the
glory
thou
dost
here
unveil
before
mine
eyes
pardon
my
sins
accept
my
life
sanctify
my
love
a
murmur
of
relief
and
rejoicing
ran
rippling
through
the
listening
crowds
a
weight
seemed
lifted
from
their
minds
the
victim
was
willing
to
die
after
all
the
sacrifice
would
be
proceeded
with
there
was
a
slight
pause
during
which
the
priests
crossed
and
the
sanctuary
many
times
one
of
them
descending
the
steps
to
tie
niphrata
hands
behind
her
back
as
before
in
the
immediate
interest
of
the
moment
and
his
hot
interference
seemed
to
be
almost
forgotten
a
few
people
indeed
cast
injured
and
indignant
looks
toward
the
corner
where
he
dejectedly
leaned
and
once
the
wrinkled
malicious
head
of
old
zabastes
peered
at
him
with
an
expression
of
incredulous
amazement
but
otherwise
no
sympathy
was
manifested
by
any
one
for
the
popular
laureate
suffering
and
discomfiture
he
was
the
nation
puppet
its
tame
bird
whose
business
was
to
sing
when
bidden
but
he
was
not
expected
to
have
any
voice
in
matters
of
religion
or
policy
and
still
less
was
he
supposed
to
intrude
any
of
his
own
personal
griefs
on
the
public
notice
let
him
sing
and
sing
well
that
was
enough
but
let
him
dare
to
be
afflicted
and
annoy
others
with
his
wants
and
troubles
why
then
he
at
once
became
uninteresting
he
might
even
die
for
all
anybody
cared
this
was
the
unspoken
sullen
thought
that
theos
sensitive
to
the
core
on
his
friend
behalf
instinctively
felt
to
be
smouldering
in
the
heart
of
the
mighty
multitude
and
he
resented
the
latent
ungratefulness
of
the
people
with
all
his
soul
fools
he
muttered
under
his
breath
for
you
and
such
as
you
the
wisest
sages
toil
in
vain
on
you
art
wastes
her
treasures
of
suggestive
loveliness
low
grovellers
in
earth
ye
have
no
eyes
for
heaven
o
ignorant
ungenerous
fickle
hypocrites
whose
ruling
passion
is
the
greed
of
gold
why
should
great
men
perish
that
ye
may
live
and
your
acclamations
make
up
the
thing
called
fame
fame
good
god
is
a
brief
shout
in
the
universal
clamor
scarce
heard
and
soon
forgotten
and
filled
with
strange
bitterness
he
gazed
disconsolately
at
niphrata
who
stood
like
one
in
a
trance
of
ecstasy
patiently
awaiting
her
doom
her
lovely
innocent
blue
eyes
gladly
upturned
to
the
long
head
of
nagaya
which
twined
round
the
summit
of
the
ebony
staff
seemed
to
peer
down
at
her
in
a
sort
of
drowsy
reflectiveness
then
all
suddenly
lysia
spoke
how
enchanting
was
the
exquisite
modulation
of
that
slow
languid
silvery
voice
come
hither
o
maiden
fair
pure
and
faithful
the
desire
of
thy
soul
is
granted
before
thee
are
the
gates
of
the
unknown
world
already
they
open
to
admit
thee
through
their
golden
bars
gleams
the
glory
of
thy
future
speak
what
seest
thou
a
moment
of
breathless
silence
ensued
all
present
seemed
to
be
straining
their
ears
to
catch
the
victim
answer
it
came
soft
and
clear
as
a
bell
i
see
a
wondrous
land
with
skies
of
gold
and
azure
white
flowers
grow
in
the
fragrant
fields
there
are
many
trees
i
hear
the
warbling
of
many
birds
i
see
fair
faces
that
smile
upon
me
and
gentle
hands
that
beckon
figures
that
wear
glistening
robes
and
carry
garlands
of
roses
and
myrtle
pass
slowly
singing
as
they
go
how
beautiful
they
are
how
strange
how
sweet
and
as
she
uttered
these
words
in
accents
of
dreamy
delight
she
ascended
the
first
step
of
the
shrine
theos
looking
held
his
breath
in
wonder
and
fear
while
with
a
groan
turned
himself
resolutely
away
and
pressing
his
forehead
against
the
great
column
where
he
stood
hid
his
eyes
in
his
clasped
hands
the
high
priestess
continued
come
hither
o
maiden
of
chaste
and
patient
life
rejoice
greatly
for
thy
virtue
hath
pleased
the
gods
the
undiscovered
marvels
of
the
stars
are
thine
earth
has
no
more
control
over
thee
heaven
is
thine
absolute
heritage
behold
the
ship
of
the
sun
awaits
thee
speak
what
seest
thou
a
soft
cry
of
rapture
came
from
the
girl
lips
oh
i
see
glory
everywhere
she
light
everywhere
peace
everywhere
o
joy
joy
the
face
of
my
beloved
shines
upon
me
he
calls
he
bids
me
come
to
him
ah
we
shall
be
together
at
last
we
twain
shall
be
as
one
never
to
part
never
to
doubt
never
to
suffer
more
o
let
me
hasten
to
him
why
should
i
linger
thus
when
i
would
fain
be
gone
and
she
sprang
eagerly
up
the
second
and
third
steps
of
the
sanctuary
and
faced
lysia
her
head
thrown
back
her
blue
eyes
ablaze
with
excitement
her
bosom
heaving
and
her
delicate
features
transfigured
and
illumined
by
unspeakable
inward
delirious
bliss
just
then
the
priest
zel
lifted
the
long
knife
from
the
black
cushion
where
it
had
lain
till
now
and
crouching
stealthily
in
the
shadow
behind
lysia
held
it
in
both
bands
pointed
straight
forward
in
a
level
line
with
niphrata
breast
thus
armed
he
waited
silent
and
immovable
a
slight
shudder
of
morbid
expectancy
seemed
to
quiver
through
the
vast
congregation
but
theos
nerves
were
strung
up
to
such
a
high
pitch
of
frenzied
horror
that
he
could
neither
speak
nor
sigh
motionless
as
a
statue
he
could
only
watch
with
freezing
blood
each
detail
of
the
extraordinary
scene
once
more
the
high
priestess
spoke
come
hither
o
happy
maiden
whose
griefs
are
ended
the
day
of
thy
triumph
and
reward
has
dawned
for
thee
the
immortals
unveiled
the
mysteries
of
being
to
thee
they
openly
declare
all
secrets
to
thee
the
hidden
things
of
wisdom
are
made
manifest
for
the
last
time
ere
thou
leavest
us
hear
and
answer
speak
what
seest
thou
love
replied
niphrata
in
a
tone
of
thrilling
and
solemn
love
the
eternal
all
in
which
dark
things
are
made
light
love
that
is
never
served
in
vain
love
wherein
lost
happiness
is
rediscovered
and
perfected
o
divine
love
by
whom
the
passion
of
my
heart
is
sanctified
absorb
me
in
the
quenchless
glory
of
thine
immortality
draw
me
to
thyself
and
let
me
find
in
thee
my
completion
her
voice
sank
to
a
low
prayerful
emphasis
her
look
was
as
of
a
rapt
angel
waiting
for
wings
lysia
gaze
dwelt
upon
her
with
wonder
and
such
a
devout
and
earnest
supplication
was
evidently
not
commonly
heard
from
the
lips
of
victims
at
that
instant
too
nagaya
himself
seemed
curiously
excited
and
disturbed
his
great
glittering
coils
quivered
so
violently
as
to
shake
the
rod
on
which
he
was
twined
and
when
his
priestess
raised
her
mesmeric
reproving
eyes
toward
him
he
bent
back
his
head
rebelliously
and
sent
a
vehement
hiss
through
the
silence
like
the
noise
made
by
the
whirl
of
a
scimitar
suddenly
and
with
deafening
abruptness
a
clap
of
thunder
short
and
sharp
as
a
quick
volley
of
musketry
crashed
overhead
accompanied
by
a
strange
circular
sweep
of
lightning
that
blazed
through
the
windows
of
the
temple
illumining
it
from
end
to
end
with
a
brilliant
blue
glare
the
superstitious
crowd
exchanged
startled
looks
of
terror
the
king
moved
uneasily
and
glanced
frowningly
about
him
it
was
plainly
manifest
that
no
one
had
forgotten
the
disastrous
downfall
of
the
obelisk
there
seemed
to
be
a
contagion
of
alarm
in
the
very
air
but
lysia
was
perfectly
in
fact
she
appeared
to
accept
the
threat
of
a
storm
as
an
imposing
and
by
no
means
undesirable
adjunct
to
the
mysteries
of
the
sacrificial
rite
for
riveting
her
basilisk
eyes
on
niphrata
she
said
in
firm
clear
decisive
accents
the
gods
grow
impatient
wherefore
o
princess
and
people
of
let
us
hasten
to
appease
their
anger
depart
o
stainless
maid
depart
hence
and
betake
thee
to
the
golden
throne
of
the
sun
our
lord
and
ruler
and
in
the
name
of
nagaya
may
the
shedding
of
thy
virginal
blood
avert
from
us
and
ours
the
wrath
of
the
immortals
linger
no
longer
nagaya
accepts
thee
and
the
hour
strikes
death
with
the
last
word
a
sullen
bell
boomed
heavily
through
and
through
the
and
at
once
like
a
frenzied
bird
or
butterfly
winging
its
way
into
scorching
flame
niphrata
rushed
forward
with
swift
unhesitating
dreadful
precision
straight
on
the
knife
outheld
by
the
untrembling
ruthless
hands
of
the
priest
zel
one
second
and
theos
sick
with
horror
saw
her
speeding
thus
the
next
and
the
whole
place
was
enveloped
in
dense
darkness
chapter
xxix
the
cup
of
wrath
and
trembling
a
flash
of
time
an
instant
of
black
horrid
eclipse
too
brief
for
the
utterance
of
even
a
word
or
cry
and
then
with
an
appalling
roar
as
of
the
splitting
of
huge
rocks
and
the
tearing
asunder
of
mighty
mountains
the
murky
gloom
was
lifted
rent
devoured
and
swept
away
on
all
sides
by
a
sudden
bursting
forth
of
fire
fire
leaped
up
alive
in
twenty
different
parts
of
the
building
springing
aloft
in
spiral
coils
from
the
marble
pavement
that
yawned
crashingly
open
to
give
the
impetuous
flames
their
rapid
egress
fire
climbed
lithely
round
and
round
the
immense
carven
columns
and
ran
nimbly
dancing
and
crackling
its
way
among
the
painted
and
begemmed
decorations
of
the
dome
fire
enwrapped
the
and
shrivelled
the
jewelled
idols
at
a
breath
fire
unfastened
and
shook
down
the
the
garlands
the
splendid
draperies
of
silk
and
fire
fire
everywhere
and
the
madly
affrighted
multitude
stunned
by
the
abrupt
shock
of
terror
stood
for
a
moment
paralyzed
and
inert
then
with
one
desperate
yell
of
wild
brute
fear
and
ferocity
they
rushed
headlong
in
a
struggling
shrieking
cursing
sweltering
swarm
toward
the
great
closed
portals
of
the
central
aisle
as
they
did
so
a
tremendous
weight
of
thunder
seemed
to
descend
solidly
on
the
roof
with
a
thudding
burst
as
though
a
thousand
walls
had
been
battered
down
at
one
blow
the
whole
edifice
rocked
and
trembled
in
the
terrific
reverberation
and
almost
simultaneously
the
doors
were
violently
jerked
open
wrenched
from
their
hinges
and
hurled
all
burning
and
split
with
flame
against
the
crowds
several
hundred
fell
under
the
fiery
mass
a
charred
heap
of
corpses
the
raging
remainder
pressed
on
in
frenzied
haste
clambering
over
piles
of
burning
dead
trampling
on
scorched
disfigured
faces
that
perhaps
but
a
moment
since
had
been
dear
to
them
each
and
all
bent
on
forcing
a
way
out
to
the
open
air
in
the
midst
of
the
overwhelming
awfulness
of
the
scene
theos
still
retained
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
remember
that
whatever
happened
his
first
care
must
be
for
always
for
no
matter
who
else
perished
and
he
now
held
that
beloved
comrade
closely
clasped
by
the
arm
while
he
eagerly
glanced
about
him
on
every
side
for
some
outlet
through
which
to
make
a
good
and
swift
escape
the
most
immediate
place
of
safety
seemed
to
be
the
inner
sanctuary
of
nagaya
it
was
untouched
by
the
flames
and
its
titanic
pillars
of
brass
and
bronze
suggested
in
their
very
massiveness
a
nearly
impregnable
harbor
of
refuge
the
king
had
fled
thither
and
now
stood
like
a
statue
of
undaunted
gloomy
amazement
beside
lysia
who
on
her
part
appeared
literally
frozen
with
terror
her
large
startled
eyes
roving
here
and
there
in
helpless
anxiety
alone
gave
any
animation
to
the
deathly
rigid
whiteness
of
her
face
and
she
still
mechanically
supported
the
sacred
ebony
staff
without
apparently
being
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
snake
deity
convulsed
through
all
his
coils
with
fright
had
begun
to
make
his
rapid
descent
the
priests
the
virgins
the
poor
unhappy
little
singing
children
flocked
hurriedly
together
and
darted
to
the
back
of
the
great
shrine
in
the
manifest
intention
of
reaching
some
private
way
of
egress
known
only
to
themselves
but
their
attempts
were
evidently
frustrated
for
no
sooner
had
they
gone
than
they
sped
back
again
their
faces
scorched
and
blackened
and
uttering
cries
and
woeful
lamentations
they
flung
themselves
wildly
among
the
struggling
crowds
in
the
main
body
of
the
temple
and
fought
for
life
in
the
jaws
of
death
every
one
for
self
and
no
one
for
another
volumes
of
smoke
rolled
up
from
the
ground
in
thick
and
suffocating
clouds
accompanied
by
incessant
sharp
reports
like
the
close
firing
of
guns
jets
of
flame
and
showers
of
cinders
broke
forth
scattering
hot
destruction
on
every
hand
while
a
few
flying
sparks
caught
the
end
of
the
silver
veil
and
withered
it
into
nothingness
with
one
bright
resolute
flare
half
maddened
by
the
shrieks
and
dying
groans
that
resounded
everywhere
about
him
and
yet
all
the
time
feeling
as
though
he
were
some
spectator
set
apart
and
condemned
to
watch
the
progress
of
a
ghastly
phantasmagoria
in
hell
theos
was
just
revolving
in
his
mind
whether
it
would
or
would
not
be
possible
to
make
a
determined
climb
for
escape
through
one
of
the
tall
painted
windows
some
of
which
were
not
yet
reached
by
the
fire
when
with
a
sudden
passionate
exclamation
broke
from
his
hold
and
rushed
to
the
sanctuary
quick
as
lightning
theos
followed
him
followed
him
close
as
he
sprang
up
the
steps
and
confronted
lysia
with
eager
outstretched
arms
the
dead
niphrita
lay
near
him
fair
as
a
sculptured
saint
with
the
cruel
wound
of
sacrifice
in
her
breast
but
he
seemed
not
to
see
that
piteous
corpse
of
faithfulness
his
grief
for
her
death
had
been
a
mere
transient
emotion
his
stronger
earthly
passions
their
tempestuous
sway
and
for
sweet
things
perished
and
gone
to
heaven
he
had
no
further
care
on
lysia
and
on
lysia
living
beauty
alone
his
eyes
flamed
their
ardent
glory
come
come
he
come
my
love
my
life
let
me
save
thee
or
if
i
can
not
save
thee
let
us
die
together
scarcely
had
the
words
left
his
lips
when
the
king
with
a
swift
forward
movement
like
the
pounce
of
some
turned
fiercely
upon
him
amazement
jealousy
distrust
revenge
all
gathering
stormily
in
the
black
frown
of
his
bent
vindictive
brows
his
great
chest
heaved
pantingly
his
teeth
glittered
wolfishly
through
his
jetty
beard
and
in
the
terrible
of
the
moment
the
fury
of
the
spreading
conflagration
was
forgotten
at
any
rate
by
theos
who
stricken
numb
and
rigid
by
a
shock
of
alarm
too
poignant
for
expression
stared
aghast
at
the
three
figures
before
him
lysia
zephoranim
especially
zephoranim
whose
bursting
wrath
threatened
to
choke
his
utterance
what
sayest
thou
he
demanded
in
a
sort
of
ferocious
gasping
whisper
repeat
thy
words
repeat
them
and
his
hand
clutched
at
his
while
his
restless
lowering
glance
flashed
from
lysia
to
the
laureate
and
from
the
laureate
back
to
lysia
death
encompasses
us
this
is
no
time
for
trifling
speak
and
his
voice
suddenly
rose
to
a
frantic
shout
of
rage
speak
what
is
this
woman
to
thee
everything
returned
with
prompt
and
passionate
fearlessness
his
glorious
eyes
blazing
a
proud
defiance
as
he
everything
that
woman
can
be
or
ever
shall
be
unto
man
call
her
by
whatsoever
name
a
foolish
creed
enjoins
of
the
sun
or
of
nagaya
she
is
nevertheless
mine
and
mine
only
i
am
her
lover
thou
and
with
a
hoarse
cry
zephoranim
sprang
upon
and
seized
him
by
the
thou
liest
i
i
crowned
king
of
i
am
her
lover
chosen
by
her
out
of
all
men
and
dost
thou
dare
to
pretend
that
she
hath
preferred
thee
a
mere
singer
of
mad
songs
to
me
thou
unscrupulous
knave
i
tell
thee
she
is
mine
dost
hear
me
mine
and
he
shrieked
the
last
word
out
in
a
perfect
hurricane
of
passion
my
my
mistress
heart
of
my
heart
soul
of
my
soul
let
the
city
burn
to
ashes
and
the
whole
land
be
utterly
consumed
in
death
as
in
life
lysia
is
mine
and
the
gods
themselves
shall
never
part
her
from
me
and
suddenly
releasing
his
grasp
he
hurled
away
as
he
might
have
hurled
aside
a
toy
figure
and
a
peal
of
reckless
musical
laughter
echoed
mockingly
through
the
vaulted
shrine
it
was
laughter
and
theos
blood
grew
cold
as
he
heard
its
cruel
silvery
ring
even
so
had
she
laughed
when
died
reeled
backward
from
the
king
thrust
but
did
not
fall
white
and
trembling
with
his
sad
and
splendid
features
frozen
as
it
were
into
a
sculptured
mask
of
agonized
beauty
he
turned
upon
the
treacherous
woman
he
loved
the
silent
challenge
of
his
eloquent
eyes
oh
that
look
of
piteous
pain
and
wonder
a
whole
wasted
opportunities
seemed
concentrated
in
its
unspeakable
reproach
she
met
it
with
a
sort
of
triumphant
tranquil
indifference
an
uncontrollable
wicked
smile
curved
the
corners
of
her
red
lips
the
sacred
ebony
staff
had
somehow
slipped
from
her
hands
and
it
now
lay
on
the
ground
the
serpent
still
clinging
to
it
in
glittering
lengths
that
appeared
to
be
quite
motionless
ah
lysia
hast
thou
played
me
false
cried
the
unhappy
laureate
at
last
as
with
a
quick
impulsive
movement
he
caught
her
round
jewelled
arm
in
a
resolute
after
all
thy
vows
thy
endearments
thy
embraces
hast
thou
betrayed
me
speak
truly
art
thou
not
all
in
all
to
me
hast
thou
not
given
thyself
body
and
soul
into
my
keeping
to
this
braggart
king
i
deign
no
answer
one
word
of
thine
will
suffice
be
be
faithful
declare
thy
love
for
me
even
as
thou
hast
oft
declared
it
a
thousand
remembered
times
over
the
face
of
the
beautiful
priestess
swept
a
strange
expression
of
mingled
fear
antagonism
loathing
and
exultation
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
red
tongued
leaping
flames
that
tossed
in
eddying
rings
round
the
temple
running
every
second
nearer
to
the
place
where
she
stood
and
in
that
one
glance
she
seemed
to
recognize
the
hopelessness
of
rescue
and
certainty
of
death
a
careless
haughty
acceptance
of
her
fate
manifested
itself
in
the
pallid
resolve
of
her
drawn
features
but
as
she
allowed
her
gaze
to
return
and
dwell
on
the
old
malicious
mirth
flushed
and
gave
lustre
to
her
loveliness
and
she
laughed
again
a
laugh
of
uttermost
bitter
scorn
declare
my
love
for
thee
she
said
in
thrilling
thou
boaster
let
the
gods
who
have
kindled
this
fiery
end
for
us
bear
witness
to
my
hatred
i
hate
thee
aye
even
thee
and
she
pointed
at
him
jeeringly
as
he
recoiled
from
her
in
wide
eyed
anguish
and
amazement
no
man
have
i
ever
loved
but
thee
have
i
hated
most
of
all
all
men
have
i
despised
for
their
folly
greed
and
i
have
fought
them
with
their
own
weapons
of
avarice
cunning
cruelty
and
falsehood
but
thou
hast
been
even
beneath
my
contempt
was
scarcely
worth
my
while
to
fool
thee
thou
wert
so
easily
fooled
was
idle
sport
to
rouse
thy
passions
they
were
so
easily
roused
poet
and
perjurer
singer
and
sophist
thou
to
whom
the
genius
of
poesy
was
as
a
pearl
set
in
a
swine
snout
thou
wert
not
worthy
to
be
my
dupe
seeing
that
thou
camest
to
me
already
in
bonds
the
dupe
of
thine
own
self
niphrata
loved
thee
and
thou
didst
play
with
and
torture
her
more
unmercifully
than
wild
beasts
play
with
and
torture
their
prey
but
thou
couldst
never
trifle
with
me
o
thou
who
hast
taken
so
much
pride
in
the
breaking
of
many
hearts
learn
that
thou
hast
never
stirred
one
throb
of
passion
in
mine
that
i
have
loathed
thy
beauty
while
caressing
thee
and
longed
to
slay
thee
while
embracing
thee
and
that
even
now
i
would
i
saw
thee
dead
before
me
ere
i
myself
am
forced
to
die
pausing
in
the
swift
torrent
of
her
words
her
white
breast
heaved
violently
with
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
panting
breath
her
dark
brilliant
eyes
dilated
while
the
symbolic
jewel
she
wore
and
the
crown
of
serpents
heads
in
her
streaming
hair
seemed
to
glitter
about
her
like
so
many
points
of
lightning
at
that
instant
one
side
of
the
sanctuary
split
asunder
giving
way
to
a
bursting
wreath
of
flames
seeing
this
she
uttered
a
piercing
cry
and
stretched
out
her
arms
zephoranim
save
me
in
a
second
the
king
sprang
toward
her
but
not
before
wild
with
wrath
had
interposed
himself
between
them
back
he
exclaimed
passionately
addressing
the
infuriated
while
i
live
lysia
is
mine
let
her
hate
and
deny
me
as
she
will
and
sooner
than
see
her
in
thine
arms
o
king
i
will
slay
her
where
she
stands
his
bold
attitude
was
magnificent
his
countenance
more
than
beautiful
in
its
love
betrayed
despair
and
for
a
moment
the
savage
zephoranim
paused
irresolute
his
scowling
brows
bent
on
his
erstwhile
favorite
minstrel
with
an
expression
that
hovered
curiously
between
bitterest
enmity
and
reluctant
reverence
there
seemed
to
be
a
struggling
consciousness
in
his
mind
of
the
immortality
of
a
poet
as
compared
with
the
evanescent
power
of
a
king
and
also
a
quick
realization
of
the
truth
that
let
his
anger
be
what
it
would
they
twain
were
partakers
in
the
same
evil
and
were
mutually
deceived
by
the
same
false
woman
but
ere
his
saving
sense
of
justice
could
prevail
a
ripple
of
discordant
delirious
laughter
broke
once
more
from
lysia
lips
her
eye
shone
vindictively
her
whole
face
became
animated
with
a
sudden
glow
of
fiendish
triumph
zephoranim
she
cried
hero
warrior
king
thou
who
hast
risked
thy
crown
and
throne
and
life
for
my
sake
and
the
love
of
me
wilt
lose
me
now
wilt
let
me
perish
in
these
raging
flames
to
satisfy
this
wanton
liar
and
unbeliever
in
the
gods
to
whose
disturbance
of
the
holy
ritual
we
surely
owe
this
present
fiery
disaster
save
me
o
strong
and
noble
zephoranim
save
me
and
with
me
save
the
city
and
the
people
kill
o
barbarous
inexorable
words
they
rang
like
a
desolating
knell
in
the
ears
of
the
bewildered
theos
and
startled
him
from
his
rigid
trance
of
speechless
misery
uttering
an
inarticulate
dull
groan
he
made
a
violent
effort
to
rush
forward
to
serve
as
a
living
shield
of
defence
to
his
adored
friend
to
ward
off
the
imminent
blow
too
late
too
late
zephoranim
dagger
glittered
in
the
air
and
rapidly
descended
one
gasping
cry
and
lay
prone
beautiful
as
a
slain
adonis
the
rich
red
blood
pouring
from
his
heart
and
a
faint
stern
smile
frozen
on
the
proud
lips
whose
dulcet
was
now
struck
dumb
forever
with
a
shriek
of
agony
theos
threw
himself
beside
his
murdered
comrade
heedless
of
king
priestess
flames
and
all
the
fury
of
earth
and
heaven
he
bent
above
that
motionless
form
and
gazed
yearningly
into
the
fair
colorless
face
no
sign
no
tremulous
stir
of
breath
dead
dead
dead
in
his
prime
of
years
dead
in
the
zenith
of
his
glory
all
the
delicate
dreaming
genius
turned
to
dust
and
ashes
all
the
ardent
light
of
inspiration
quenched
in
the
darkness
of
the
grave
and
in
the
first
delirious
paroxysm
of
his
grief
theos
felt
as
though
life
time
and
the
world
were
ended
for
him
also
with
this
one
suddenly
destroyed
existence
o
thou
mad
king
he
cried
fiercely
thou
hast
slain
the
chief
wonder
of
thy
realm
and
reign
die
now
when
thou
wilt
thou
shalt
only
he
remembered
as
the
murderer
of
whose
name
shall
live
when
thine
is
covered
in
shameful
oblivion
zephoranim
frowned
and
threw
the
dagger
from
him
peace
clamorous
fool
he
said
hath
gone
but
a
moment
before
me
as
poet
he
hath
received
precedence
even
in
death
when
the
last
hour
comes
for
all
of
us
it
matters
not
how
we
die
and
whether
i
am
hereafter
remembered
or
forgotten
i
care
not
i
have
lived
as
a
man
should
live
fearing
nothing
and
conquered
by
none
except
perchance
by
love
that
hath
brought
many
kings
ere
now
to
untimely
ruin
here
his
moody
eyes
lighted
on
lysia
how
many
lovers
hast
thou
had
fair
soul
he
demanded
in
a
stern
yet
tremulous
voice
a
thousand
i
would
swear
this
dead
minstrel
of
mine
was
one
for
though
i
slew
him
at
thy
bidding
i
saw
the
truth
in
his
dying
eyes
no
matter
we
shall
meet
in
hades
and
there
we
shall
have
ample
time
to
urge
our
rival
claims
upon
thy
favor
ah
and
he
suddenly
laid
his
two
strong
hands
on
her
white
uncovered
shoulders
and
gazed
at
her
reproachfully
as
she
shrank
a
little
beneath
his
close
scrutiny
thou
divine
traitress
have
i
not
challenged
the
very
heavens
for
thy
sake
and
lo
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
and
must
fall
how
many
men
would
have
loved
thee
as
i
have
loved
none
not
even
this
dead
slain
like
a
dog
to
give
thee
pleasure
come
let
me
kiss
thee
once
again
ere
death
makes
cold
our
lips
false
or
true
thou
art
nevertheless
fair
and
the
wrathful
gods
know
best
how
i
worship
thy
fairness
and
folding
his
arms
about
her
he
kissed
her
passionately
she
clung
to
him
like
a
lithe
serpentine
thing
her
eyes
ablaze
her
mouth
quivering
with
suppressed
hysterical
laughter
pointing
to
body
she
said
in
a
strange
excited
whisper
nay
hast
thou
slain
him
in
very
truth
zephoranim
slain
him
utterly
for
i
have
heard
that
poets
can
not
die
they
live
when
the
whole
world
deems
them
dead
they
rise
from
their
shut
graves
and
the
earth
with
all
the
secrets
of
past
time
oh
my
brain
reels
i
talk
mere
madness
there
is
no
afterwards
of
death
no
no
no
gods
no
anything
but
and
silence
for
us
and
for
all
men
how
good
it
is
how
excellently
devised
a
jest
that
the
whole
wide
universe
should
be
but
a
cheat
of
time
a
bubble
blown
into
space
to
float
break
and
perish
all
for
the
idle
sport
of
some
unknown
and
shapeless
shuddering
she
clasped
her
hands
round
the
monarch
throat
and
hid
her
wild
eyes
in
his
breast
while
he
unnerved
by
her
distraction
and
his
own
inward
torture
glared
about
him
on
all
sides
for
some
glimmering
chance
of
rescue
but
could
see
none
the
flames
were
now
attacking
the
shrine
on
every
side
like
a
besieging
army
their
leaping
darts
of
blue
and
crimson
gleaming
here
and
there
with
indescribable
velocity
and
still
theos
knelt
by
corpse
in
despair
endeavoring
with
feverish
zeal
to
stanch
the
oozing
blood
with
a
strip
torn
from
his
own
garments
and
listening
anxiously
for
the
feeblest
or
smaller
pulsation
of
smouldering
life
in
the
senseless
stiffening
clay
all
at
once
a
hideous
scream
assailed
his
ears
another
and
yet
another
rang
above
the
crackling
roar
of
the
gradually
conquering
fire
and
body
in
his
arms
he
looked
up
o
horror
horror
his
nerves
contracted
his
blood
seemed
to
turn
to
ice
in
his
veins
his
head
swam
giddily
and
he
thought
the
moment
of
his
own
death
had
come
for
surely
no
man
could
behold
the
sight
he
saw
and
yet
continue
to
live
on
lysia
the
captor
was
made
captive
at
last
helpless
imprisoned
and
hopelessly
doomed
had
claimed
his
own
the
huge
snake
terrified
beyond
all
control
at
the
bursting
breadth
of
fire
environing
the
shrine
had
turned
in
its
brute
fear
to
the
mistress
it
had
for
years
been
accustomed
to
obey
and
had
now
with
one
stealthy
noiseless
spring
twisted
its
uppermost
coil
close
about
her
waist
where
its
restless
head
alarmed
eyes
and
darting
fangs
all
glistened
together
like
a
blazing
cluster
of
gems
the
more
she
struggled
to
release
herself
from
its
deathful
embrace
the
tighter
its
body
contracted
and
the
more
maddened
with
fright
it
became
shriek
upon
shriek
broke
from
her
lips
and
pierced
the
suffocating
air
while
with
all
his
great
muscular
force
zephoranim
the
king
strove
in
desperate
agony
to
tear
her
from
the
awful
clutch
of
the
monster
he
had
but
lately
knelt
to
as
divine
in
vain
vain
the
strongest
efforts
were
useless
the
cruel
beautiful
pitiless
priestess
of
nagaya
was
condemned
to
suffer
the
same
frightful
death
she
had
so
often
mercilessly
decreed
for
others
closer
and
closer
grew
the
fearful
python
constricting
clasp
nearer
and
nearer
swept
the
dancing
battalion
of
destroying
flames
for
one
fleeting
breath
of
time
theos
stared
aghast
at
the
horrid
scene
then
making
a
superhuman
effort
he
raised
corpse
entirely
from
the
ground
and
staggered
with
his
burden
away
away
from
the
burning
shrine
the
funeral
pyre
as
it
vaguely
seemed
to
him
of
a
wasted
love
and
a
dead
passion
whither
should
he
go
down
into
the
blazing
area
of
the
temple
surely
no
safety
could
be
found
there
where
the
fire
was
raging
at
its
utmost
height
yet
he
went
on
mechanically
as
though
urged
forward
by
some
force
superior
to
his
own
always
clinging
to
the
idea
that
his
friend
still
lived
and
that
if
he
could
only
reach
some
place
of
temporary
shelter
he
might
yet
be
able
to
restore
him
it
was
possible
the
wound
was
not
fatal
far
more
possible
to
his
mind
than
that
so
gloriously
famed
a
poet
should
be
dead
so
he
dimly
thought
while
he
stumbled
dizzily
along
his
forehead
wet
with
clammy
dews
his
limbs
trembling
under
the
weight
he
bore
his
eyes
by
the
hot
flying
sparks
and
drifting
smoke
and
his
soul
shaken
and
appalled
by
the
ghastly
sights
that
met
his
view
wheresoever
he
turned
crushed
and
writhing
bodies
of
men
women
and
children
heaps
of
corpses
fast
blazing
to
ashes
broken
and
falling
columns
yawning
gaps
in
the
ground
from
which
were
cast
forth
volleys
of
red
cinders
and
streams
of
lava
all
these
multitudinous
horrors
surrounded
him
as
with
uncertain
faltering
steps
he
moved
on
like
a
sick
man
walking
in
sleep
carrying
his
precious
burden
he
knew
nothing
of
where
he
was
bound
he
saw
no
outlet
anywhere
no
corner
wherein
the
had
not
set
up
devouring
dominion
but
nevertheless
he
steadily
continued
his
difficult
progress
clasping
corpse
with
a
strange
tenacity
and
concentrating
all
his
attention
on
protecting
it
from
the
withering
touch
of
the
ravenous
flames
all
at
once
as
he
strove
to
force
his
way
over
a
fallen
altar
from
which
the
hideous
presiding
stone
idol
had
toppled
headlong
killing
in
its
descent
some
twenty
or
thirty
people
whose
bodies
lay
crushed
beneath
it
a
face
horribly
disfigured
and
tortured
into
a
mere
burnt
sketch
of
its
former
likeness
twisted
itself
up
and
peered
at
him
the
face
of
zabastes
the
critic
his
protruding
eyes
glistened
with
something
of
their
old
malign
expression
as
he
perceived
whose
helpless
form
it
was
that
was
being
carried
by
what
is
the
famous
gone
he
gasped
his
words
half
choking
him
in
their
utterance
as
he
stretched
out
a
skinny
hand
and
caught
at
theos
garments
good
youth
stay
stay
why
burden
thyself
with
a
corpse
when
thou
mightest
rescue
a
living
man
save
me
save
me
i
was
the
poet
adverse
critic
and
who
but
i
should
write
his
eulogy
now
that
he
is
no
more
pity
pity
most
courteous
gentle
sir
save
me
if
only
for
the
sake
of
future
honor
thou
knowest
not
how
warmly
how
generously
how
nobly
i
can
praise
the
dead
theos
gazed
down
upon
him
in
unspeakable
melancholy
scorn
was
it
only
through
creatures
such
as
this
miserable
zabastes
that
the
of
perished
poets
was
proclaimed
to
the
world
what
then
was
the
actual
worth
of
fame
shuddering
he
wrenched
himself
away
and
passed
on
silently
heedless
of
the
savage
curses
the
despairing
scribe
yelled
after
him
as
he
went
and
he
involuntarily
pressed
the
dead
corpse
of
his
beloved
friend
closer
to
his
heart
as
though
he
thought
he
could
it
by
this
mute
expression
of
tenderness
meanwhile
the
fire
raged
continuously
the
temple
was
fast
becoming
a
pillared
mass
of
flames
and
presently
choked
and
giddy
with
the
sulphurous
vapors
he
stopped
abruptly
struggling
for
breath
his
time
had
come
at
last
he
thought
he
with
must
die
just
then
a
loud
muttering
and
rolling
of
thunder
swept
in
eddying
vibrations
round
him
followed
by
a
sharp
splitting
noise
raising
his
aching
eyes
he
saw
straight
before
him
a
yawning
gloomy
archway
like
the
solemn
portal
of
a
funeral
dark
yet
with
a
white
glimmer
of
steps
leading
outward
and
a
dim
sparkle
as
of
stars
in
heaven
a
rush
of
new
vigor
inspired
him
at
this
sight
and
he
resumed
his
way
stumbling
over
countless
corpses
strewn
among
fallen
blocks
of
marble
and
every
now
and
then
looking
back
in
awful
fascination
to
the
fiery
furnace
of
the
body
of
the
temple
where
of
all
the
vast
numbers
that
had
lately
crowded
it
from
end
to
end
there
were
only
a
hundred
or
so
remaining
alive
and
these
were
fast
perishing
in
frightful
agony
the
shrine
of
nagaya
was
enveloped
in
thick
black
smoke
crossed
here
and
there
by
flashes
of
flame
the
bare
outline
of
its
titanic
architecture
was
scarcely
discernible
yet
the
thought
of
the
dreadful
end
of
lysia
the
loveliest
woman
he
had
ever
seen
moved
him
now
to
no
emotion
whatever
some
deadly
evil
seemed
burnt
out
of
his
life
moreover
her
command
had
slain
enough
no
fate
however
horrible
could
be
more
so
than
she
in
her
wanton
wickedness
deserved
but
alas
her
beauty
he
dared
not
think
of
its
subtle
slumberous
charm
and
stung
to
a
new
sense
of
desperation
he
plunged
recklessly
toward
the
dusky
aperture
he
had
seen
which
appeared
to
enlarge
itself
mysteriously
as
he
approached
like
the
opening
gateway
of
some
magic
cavern
suddenly
a
faint
groan
at
his
feet
startled
him
and
looking
down
hastily
he
perceived
an
unfortunate
man
lying
half
crushed
under
the
ponderous
fragment
of
a
split
column
which
had
fallen
across
his
body
in
such
manner
that
any
attempt
to
extricate
him
would
have
been
worse
than
useless
by
the
bright
light
of
the
leaping
flames
theos
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
pallid
countenance
of
his
late
acquaintance
the
learned
professor
of
positivism
who
was
evidently
very
near
his
woeful
and
most
positive
end
struck
by
an
impulse
of
compassion
he
paused
yet
what
could
he
say
such
a
case
where
rescue
was
impossible
all
comfort
seemed
mockery
and
while
he
stood
silent
and
irresolute
he
fancied
the
professor
smiled
it
was
a
very
ghastly
smile
nevertheless
it
hid
in
it
a
curious
touch
of
bland
and
scrupulous
inquiry
is
not
this
a
remarkable
occurrence
asked
a
voice
so
feeble
and
far
away
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
it
came
from
the
lips
of
the
suffering
sage
of
course
it
arises
from
a
volcanic
eruption
and
the
mystery
of
the
red
solved
here
an
irrepressible
moan
of
anguish
broke
through
his
heroic
effort
at
equanimity
it
is
not
a
phenomenon
and
a
gleam
of
obstinate
lit
up
his
poor
glazing
eyes
nothing
is
phenonmenal
only
i
am
not
able
to
explain
i
have
no
time
no
time
to
my
very
singular
sensations
a
rush
of
blood
choked
his
utterance
his
throat
rattled
he
was
dead
and
the
dreary
speculative
smile
froze
on
his
mouth
in
the
likeness
of
a
solemn
sneer
at
that
moment
a
terrific
swirling
surging
noise
like
the
furious
boiling
of
an
underground
whirlpool
rumbled
heavily
through
the
air
and
lo
with
a
sudden
swift
shock
that
sent
theos
reeling
forward
and
almost
falling
under
the
burdensome
weight
he
carried
the
earth
opened
disclosing
a
huge
pit
of
black
nothingness
an
enormous
chasm
into
which
with
an
appalling
clamor
as
of
a
hundred
incessant
peals
of
thunder
the
whole
main
area
of
the
temple
together
with
its
mass
of
dead
and
dying
human
beings
sank
in
less
than
five
seconds
the
ground
closing
instantaneously
over
its
prey
with
a
sullen
roar
as
though
it
were
some
gigantic
beast
devouring
food
too
long
denied
and
instead
of
the
vanished
fane
arose
a
mighty
pillar
of
fire
a
vast
increasing
volume
of
scarlet
and
gold
flame
that
spread
outward
and
upward
higher
and
higher
in
tapering
lines
and
curves
of
living
light
while
theos
being
hurled
along
resistlessly
by
the
force
of
the
convulsion
had
reached
though
he
knew
not
how
the
dark
and
quiet
portal
with
its
steps
the
only
visible
last
hope
and
chance
of
safety
and
he
now
leaned
against
its
cold
stone
arch
trembling
in
every
limb
clasping
the
dead
close
and
looking
back
in
affrighted
awe
at
the
tossing
vortex
of
fury
from
which
he
had
miraculously
escaped
and
as
he
looked
a
host
of
spectral
faces
seemed
to
rise
whitely
out
of
the
flames
and
wonder
at
him
faces
that
were
solemn
wistful
warning
and
beseeching
by
turns
they
drifted
through
the
fire
and
smiled
and
wept
and
vanished
to
reappear
again
and
yet
again
and
as
with
painfully
beating
heart
he
strove
to
combat
the
terror
that
seized
him
at
this
strange
spectacular
delusion
all
suddenly
the
heavy
wreaths
of
smoke
that
had
till
now
hung
over
the
inner
shrine
of
nagaya
parted
like
drapery
drawn
aside
from
a
and
for
a
brief
breathing
space
of
direst
agony
he
saw
lysia
once
more
lysia
in
a
torture
as
horrible
as
any
ever
depicted
in
a
bigot
idea
of
his
enemy
hell
round
and
round
her
writhing
form
the
sacred
serpent
was
twined
in
all
his
many
coils
with
both
hands
she
had
grasped
the
creature
throat
in
her
frenzy
striving
to
thrust
back
its
quivering
fangs
from
her
breast
whereon
the
evil
eye
of
raphon
still
gleamed
distinctly
with
its
adamantine
chilly
stare
at
her
feet
lay
the
body
of
the
king
her
lover
dead
and
wrapped
in
a
ring
of
flames
alone
all
all
alone
she
confronted
death
in
its
most
appalling
her
countenance
was
distorted
yet
beautiful
still
with
the
beauty
of
a
maddened
medusa
white
and
glittering
as
a
fair
ghost
invoked
from
some
deadly
gulf
of
pain
she
stood
a
of
mingled
loveliness
and
horror
circled
on
every
side
by
fire
with
wild
straining
eyes
theos
gazed
upon
her
thus
for
the
last
time
for
with
a
crash
that
seemed
to
rend
the
very
heavens
the
great
bronze
columns
surrounding
her
which
had
up
to
the
present
resisted
the
repeated
onslaughts
of
the
flames
bent
together
all
at
once
and
fell
in
a
melting
and
the
victorious
fire
roared
loudly
above
them
enveloping
the
whole
shrine
anew
in
dense
clouds
of
smoke
and
jets
of
flame
lysia
had
perished
all
that
proud
loveliness
that
dazzling
supremacy
that
superb
voluptuousness
that
triumphant
dominion
swept
away
into
a
heap
of
undiscoverable
ashes
and
zephoranim
haughty
spirit
too
had
fled
fled
stained
with
guilt
and
most
unroyal
dishonor
all
for
the
sake
of
one
woman
fairness
the
fairness
of
body
only
the
brilliant
mask
of
flesh
that
too
often
hides
the
hideousness
of
a
devil
nature
for
one
moment
theos
remained
stupefied
by
the
sheer
horror
of
the
catastrophe
then
recalling
his
bewildered
wits
to
his
aid
he
peered
anxiously
through
the
archway
where
he
rested
there
seemed
to
be
a
dim
red
glow
at
the
end
of
the
steps
as
well
as
a
dusky
azure
tint
like
a
patch
of
midnight
sky
the
temple
was
now
nothing
but
a
hissing
shrieking
pyramid
of
flames
the
hot
and
blinding
glare
was
almost
too
intense
for
his
eyes
to
endure
yet
so
fascinated
was
he
by
the
sublime
terror
and
grandeur
of
the
spectacle
that
he
could
scarcely
make
up
his
mind
to
turn
away
from
it
the
thought
of
however
gave
the
needful
spur
to
his
flagging
energies
and
without
pausing
to
consider
where
he
might
be
going
he
slowly
and
hesitatingly
descended
the
steps
before
him
and
presently
reached
a
sort
of
small
open
court
paved
with
black
marble
here
he
tenderly
laid
his
burden
down
a
burden
grown
weightier
with
each
moment
of
its
bearing
and
letting
his
aching
arms
drop
listlessly
at
his
sides
he
looked
up
dreamily
not
all
at
once
comprehending
the
cause
of
the
vast
lurid
light
that
crimsoned
the
air
like
a
wide
aurora
borealis
everywhere
about
him
then
as
the
truth
suddenly
flashed
on
his
mind
he
uttered
a
loud
irrepressible
cry
of
amazement
and
awe
far
as
his
gaze
could
see
east
west
north
south
the
whole
city
of
was
in
flames
and
the
burning
temple
of
nagaya
was
but
a
mere
spark
in
the
enormous
breadth
of
the
general
conflagration
palaces
domes
towers
and
spires
were
tottering
to
red
destruction
fire
fire
everywhere
nothing
but
fire
save
when
a
furious
gust
of
scorching
wind
blew
aside
the
masses
of
cindery
smoke
and
showed
glimpses
of
sky
and
the
changeless
shining
of
a
few
cold
quiet
stars
he
cast
one
desperate
glance
from
earth
to
heaven
how
was
it
possible
to
escape
from
this
kindling
furnace
of
utter
annihilation
where
all
were
manifestly
doomed
how
could
he
expect
to
be
saved
and
moreover
if
was
indeed
dead
what
remained
for
him
but
to
die
also
calming
the
frenzy
of
his
thoughts
by
a
strong
effort
he
began
to
vaguely
wonder
why
and
how
it
happened
that
the
place
where
he
now
was
this
small
and
insignificant
court
had
so
far
escaped
the
fire
and
was
as
cool
and
sombre
as
a
sacred
tomb
set
apart
for
some
hero
or
poet
poet
the
word
acted
as
a
stimulant
to
his
tired
struggling
brain
and
he
all
at
once
remembered
what
had
said
to
him
at
their
first
meeting
there
is
but
one
poet
in
and
i
am
he
o
true
true
only
one
poet
only
one
glory
of
the
great
city
that
now
served
him
as
funeral
pyre
only
one
name
worth
remembering
in
all
its
perishing
the
name
of
the
beautiful
the
gifted
the
famous
the
beloved
he
was
dead
this
thought
in
its
absorbing
painfulness
straightway
drove
out
all
others
and
theos
who
had
carried
his
comrade
corpse
bravely
and
unshrinkingly
through
a
fiery
vortex
of
imminent
peril
now
sank
on
his
knees
all
desolate
and
unnerved
his
hot
tears
dropping
fast
on
that
fair
still
white
face
that
he
knew
would
never
flush
to
the
warmth
of
life
again
he
whispered
my
friend
my
more
than
brother
would
i
could
have
died
for
thee
would
thou
couldst
have
lived
to
fulfil
the
nobler
promise
of
thy
genius
better
far
thou
hadst
been
spared
to
the
world
than
i
for
i
am
nothing
but
thou
wert
everything
and
taking
the
hands
in
his
own
he
kissed
them
reverently
and
with
an
unconscious
memory
not
born
of
his
recent
adventures
folded
them
on
the
dead
laureate
breast
in
the
fashion
of
a
cross
as
he
did
this
an
icy
spasm
seemed
to
contract
his
heart
seized
by
a
sudden
insufferable
anxiety
he
stared
like
one
into
fixed
and
glassy
eyes
dead
eyes
yet
how
full
of
mysterious
significance
what
what
was
their
weird
secret
their
imminent
meaning
why
did
their
dark
and
frozen
depths
appear
to
retain
a
strange
living
undergleam
of
melting
sorrowful
beseeching
sweetness
like
the
eyes
of
one
who
prays
to
be
remembered
though
changed
after
long
absence
what
hot
and
terrible
delirium
was
this
that
snatched
at
his
whirling
brain
as
he
bent
closer
and
closer
over
the
marble
quiet
countenance
and
studied
with
a
sort
of
fierce
intentness
every
line
of
those
delicate
classic
features
on
which
high
thought
had
left
so
marked
an
impress
of
dignity
and
power
what
a
marvellous
smile
lingered
on
the
set
lips
how
wonderful
how
beautiful
how
beloved
beyond
all
words
was
this
fair
dead
god
of
poesy
on
whom
he
gazed
with
such
a
passion
of
yearning
stooping
more
and
more
he
threw
his
arms
round
the
senseless
form
and
partly
lifting
it
from
the
ground
brought
the
face
nearer
to
his
so
near
that
the
cold
mouth
almost
touched
his
then
filled
with
an
awful
unnamable
misgiving
he
scanned
his
murdered
comrade
perished
beauty
in
puzzled
vague
bewilderment
much
as
an
ignorant
dullard
might
perplexedly
scan
the
incomprehensible
characters
of
some
hieroglyphic
scroll
and
as
he
looked
a
sharp
pang
shot
through
him
like
a
whizzing
ball
of
fire
a
convulsion
of
mental
agony
shook
his
limbs
he
could
have
shrieked
aloud
in
the
extremity
of
his
torture
but
the
struggling
cry
died
gasping
in
his
throat
still
as
stone
he
kept
his
strained
steadfast
gaze
fixed
on
corpse
slowly
absorbing
the
full
horror
of
a
tremendous
suggestion
that
like
a
scorching
swept
into
every
subtle
channel
of
his
brain
for
the
dead
eyes
grew
into
the
semblance
of
his
own
eyes
the
dead
face
smiled
spectrally
back
at
him
in
the
image
of
his
own
face
it
was
as
though
he
beheld
the
picture
of
himself
slain
and
reflected
in
a
magician
mirror
round
him
the
very
heavens
seemed
given
up
to
fire
but
he
heeded
it
not
the
world
might
be
at
an
end
and
the
day
of
judgment
proclaimed
nothing
would
have
stirred
him
from
where
he
knelt
in
that
dreadful
stillness
of
mystic
martyrdom
drinking
in
the
gradual
glimmering
consciousness
of
a
terrific
truth
the
amazing
yet
scarcely
graspable
solution
of
a
supernatural
enigma
an
enigma
through
which
like
a
man
lost
in
the
depths
of
a
dark
forest
he
had
wandered
up
and
down
seeking
light
yet
finding
none
o
god
he
dumbly
prayed
thou
with
whom
all
things
are
possible
give
eyes
to
this
blind
trouble
of
my
heart
i
am
but
as
a
grain
of
dust
before
thee
a
poor
perishable
atom
devoid
of
simplest
comprehension
do
thou
of
thy
supernal
pity
teach
me
what
i
must
know
as
he
thought
out
this
unuttered
petition
a
tense
cord
seemed
to
snap
suddenly
in
his
brain
a
rush
of
tears
came
to
his
relief
and
through
their
salt
and
bitter
haze
the
face
of
appeared
to
melt
into
a
thin
and
spiritual
brightness
a
mere
aerial
outline
of
what
it
had
once
been
the
glazed
dark
eyes
seemed
to
flash
living
lightning
into
his
the
whole
lost
personality
of
the
dead
poet
seemed
to
environ
him
with
a
mysterious
potent
incorporeal
an
influence
that
he
felt
he
must
now
or
never
repel
reject
and
utterly
resist
with
a
shuddering
cry
he
tore
his
reluctant
arms
away
from
the
beloved
corpse
with
trembling
tender
fingers
he
closed
and
pressed
down
the
white
eyelids
of
those
eyes
and
kissed
the
broad
poetic
brow
whatever
thou
wert
or
art
to
me
he
murmured
in
sobbing
haste
thou
knowest
that
i
loved
thee
though
now
i
leave
thee
farewell
and
his
voice
broke
in
its
strong
agony
o
how
much
easier
to
divide
body
from
soul
than
part
myself
from
thee
beloved
god
give
thee
rest
god
pardon
thy
sins
and
mine
and
he
pressed
his
lips
once
more
on
the
folded
rigid
hands
as
he
did
so
he
inadvertently
touched
the
that
hung
from
the
dead
laureate
girdle
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
around
him
enabled
him
to
see
distinctly
what
was
written
on
it
there
were
about
twenty
lines
of
verse
in
exquisitely
clear
and
fine
caligraphy
and
as
he
read
he
knew
them
well
they
were
the
last
lines
of
the
poem
nourhalma
he
dared
trust
his
own
strength
no
longer
one
wild
adoring
lingering
parting
look
at
his
dead
rival
in
song
whom
he
had
loved
better
than
himself
and
then
full
of
a
nameless
fear
he
fled
fled
recklessly
and
with
swift
mad
fury
as
though
demons
followed
in
pursuit
fled
through
the
burning
city
as
a
lost
and
frenzied
spirit
might
speed
through
the
deserts
of
hell
everywhere
about
him
resounded
the
crackling
hiss
of
the
flames
and
the
crash
of
falling
buildings
mighty
pinnacles
and
lofty
domes
melted
and
vanished
before
is
eyes
in
a
blaze
of
brilliant
destruction
on
on
he
went
meeting
confused
scattered
crowds
of
people
whose
rushing
figures
looked
like
ghosts
flying
before
a
storm
the
cries
and
shrieks
of
women
and
children
and
the
groans
of
men
were
mingled
with
the
restless
roaring
of
lions
and
other
wild
beasts
burnt
out
of
their
dens
in
the
royal
arena
the
distant
circle
of
which
could
be
dimly
seen
surrounded
by
jets
of
fire
some
of
these
maddened
animals
ran
against
him
as
he
sped
along
the
blazing
thoroughfares
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
avoid
them
nor
was
he
sensible
of
any
other
terror
than
that
which
was
within
himself
and
was
purely
mental
on
on
still
on
he
went
a
desperate
lonely
man
lost
in
a
hideous
nightmare
of
flame
and
fury
seeing
nothing
but
one
vast
flying
rout
of
molten
red
and
gold
speaking
to
none
utterly
reckless
as
to
his
own
fate
only
impelled
on
and
on
but
whither
he
knew
not
nor
cared
to
know
all
at
once
his
strength
gave
way
his
nerves
seemed
to
break
asunder
like
so
many
a
sudden
silvery
clanging
of
bells
rang
in
his
ears
and
with
them
came
a
sound
of
multitudinous
soft
small
voices
kyrie
eleison
kyrie
eleison
hush
what
was
that
what
did
it
mean
halting
abruptly
he
gave
a
wild
glance
round
him
up
to
the
sky
where
the
flaring
flames
spread
in
tangled
lengths
and
webs
of
light
then
straight
before
him
to
the
city
of
now
a
wondrous
vision
of
redly
luminous
columns
and
cupolas
with
the
wet
gleam
of
the
river
enfolding
its
blazing
streets
and
towers
and
while
he
yet
beheld
it
lo
it
receded
from
his
view
further
further
further
away
till
it
seemed
nothing
but
the
toppling
and
smoldering
of
heavy
clouds
after
the
conflagration
of
the
sunset
hark
hark
again
kyrie
eleison
kyrie
eleison
with
a
sense
of
reeling
rapture
and
awe
he
listened
he
understood
he
found
the
name
he
had
so
long
forgotten
christ
have
mercy
upon
me
he
cried
and
in
that
one
urgent
supplication
he
uttered
all
the
anguish
of
his
soul
blind
and
dizzy
with
the
fevered
whirl
of
his
own
emotions
he
stumbled
forward
and
fell
fell
heavily
over
a
block
of
stone
stunned
by
the
shock
he
lost
consciousness
but
only
for
a
moment
a
dull
aching
in
his
temples
roused
him
and
making
a
faint
effort
to
rise
he
turned
slowly
and
languidly
on
his
arm
and
with
a
long
deep
shuddering
sigh
awoke
he
was
on
the
field
of
ardath
dawn
had
just
broken
the
east
was
one
wide
shimmering
stretch
of
warm
gold
and
over
it
lay
strips
of
blue
and
gray
like
fragments
of
torn
above
him
sparkled
the
morning
star
white
and
glittering
as
a
silver
lamp
among
the
delicate
spreading
tints
of
saffron
and
green
and
beside
him
her
clear
pure
features
flushed
by
the
roseate
splendor
of
the
sky
her
hands
clasped
on
her
breast
and
her
sweet
eyes
full
of
an
infinite
tenderness
and
yearning
knelt
edris
edris
his
angel
whom
last
he
had
seen
drifting
upward
and
away
like
a
dove
through
the
glory
of
the
cross
in
heaven
chapter
xxx
sunrise
entranced
in
amazed
ecstasy
he
lay
quite
quiet
afraid
to
speak
or
stir
this
gentle
presence
this
fair
beseeching
face
might
vanish
if
he
moved
so
he
dimly
fancied
as
he
gazed
up
at
her
in
mute
wonder
and
worship
his
devout
eyes
drinking
in
her
saintly
loveliness
from
the
deep
burnished
gold
of
her
hair
to
the
soft
white
slimness
of
her
prayerfully
folded
hands
and
while
he
looked
old
thoughts
like
birds
began
to
hover
round
his
soul
sweet
and
dear
remembrances
like
the
sunset
lighting
up
the
windows
of
an
empty
house
began
to
shine
on
the
before
nooks
and
crannies
of
his
brain
clearer
and
clearer
grew
the
reflecting
mirror
of
his
consciousness
trouble
and
perplexity
seemed
passing
away
forever
from
his
mind
a
great
and
solemn
peace
environed
him
and
he
began
to
believe
he
had
crossed
the
boundary
of
death
and
had
entered
at
last
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
o
let
him
not
break
this
holy
silence
let
him
rest
so
with
all
the
glory
of
that
shed
like
summer
sunbeams
over
him
let
him
absorb
into
his
innermost
being
the
exquisite
tenderness
of
those
innocent
hopeful
watchful
starry
eyes
whose
radiance
seemed
to
steal
into
the
golden
morning
and
give
it
a
sacred
poetry
and
infinite
marvel
of
meaning
so
he
mused
gravely
contented
while
all
through
the
brightening
skies
overhead
came
the
pale
pink
flushing
of
the
dawn
like
a
far
fluttering
and
scattering
of
everything
was
so
still
that
he
could
hear
his
own
heart
beating
forth
healthful
and
regular
pulsations
but
he
was
scarcely
conscious
of
his
own
existence
he
was
only
aware
of
the
vast
beautiful
halcyon
calm
that
encircled
him
shelteringly
and
soothed
all
care
away
gradually
however
this
deep
and
delicious
tranquillity
began
to
yield
to
a
sweeping
rush
of
memory
and
comprehension
he
knew
who
he
was
and
where
he
was
though
he
did
not
as
yet
feel
absolutely
certain
of
life
and
life
realities
for
if
the
city
of
with
all
its
vivid
wonders
its
distinct
experiences
its
brilliant
pageantry
had
been
indeed
a
dream
then
sorely
it
was
possible
he
might
be
dreaming
still
nevertheless
he
was
able
to
gather
up
the
fragments
of
lost
recollection
consecutively
enough
to
realize
by
gentle
degrees
his
actual
identity
and
position
in
the
world
he
was
theos
alwyn
a
man
of
the
nineteenth
century
after
christ
ah
thank
god
for
that
after
christ
not
one
who
had
lived
five
thousand
years
before
christ
birth
and
this
quiet
patient
maiden
at
his
side
who
was
she
a
vision
or
an
actually
existent
being
unable
to
resist
the
craving
desire
of
his
heart
he
spoke
her
name
as
he
now
remembered
it
spoke
it
in
a
faint
awed
whisper
edris
theos
my
beloved
o
sweet
and
thrilling
voice
more
musical
than
the
singing
of
birds
in
a
spring
he
raised
himself
a
little
and
looked
at
her
more
intently
she
smiled
and
that
smile
so
marvellous
in
its
pensive
peace
and
lofty
devotion
was
as
though
all
the
light
of
an
unguessed
paradise
had
suddenly
flashed
upon
his
soul
edris
he
said
again
trembling
in
the
excess
of
mingled
hope
and
fear
hast
thou
then
returned
again
from
heaven
to
lift
me
out
of
darkness
tell
me
fair
angel
do
i
wake
or
sleep
are
my
senses
deceived
is
this
land
a
dream
am
i
myself
a
dream
and
thou
the
only
manifest
sweet
truth
in
a
world
of
drifting
shadows
speak
to
me
gentle
saint
in
what
vast
mystery
have
i
been
engulfed
in
what
timeless
trance
of
in
what
blind
uncertainty
and
pain
o
sweet
resolve
my
wordless
wonder
where
have
i
strayed
what
have
i
seen
ah
let
not
my
rough
speech
fright
thee
back
to
paradise
stay
with
me
comfort
me
i
have
lost
thee
so
long
let
me
not
lose
thee
now
smiling
still
she
bent
over
him
and
pressed
her
warm
delicate
ringers
lightly
on
his
brow
and
lips
then
softly
she
rose
and
stood
erect
fear
nothing
my
beloved
she
answered
her
silvery
accents
sending
a
throb
of
holy
triumph
through
the
let
no
trouble
disquiet
thee
and
no
shadow
of
misgiving
dim
the
brightness
of
thy
waking
moments
thou
hast
slept
one
night
on
the
field
of
ardath
in
the
valley
of
vision
but
lo
the
night
is
past
and
she
pointed
toward
the
eastern
horizon
now
breaking
into
waves
of
rosy
gold
rise
and
behold
the
dawning
of
thy
new
day
roused
by
her
touch
and
fired
by
her
tone
and
the
grand
unworldly
dignity
of
her
look
and
bearing
he
sprang
up
but
as
he
met
the
full
pure
splendor
of
her
divine
eyes
and
saw
wavering
round
her
hair
a
shining
aureole
of
amber
radiance
like
a
wreath
of
woven
sunbeams
his
spirit
quailed
within
him
he
remembered
all
his
doubts
of
her
his
disbelief
and
falling
at
her
feet
he
hid
his
face
in
a
shame
that
was
better
than
all
glory
a
humiliation
that
was
sweeter
than
all
pride
edris
immortal
edris
he
passionately
prayed
as
thou
art
a
crowned
saint
in
heaven
shed
light
on
the
chaos
of
my
soul
from
the
depths
of
a
penitence
past
thought
and
speech
i
plead
with
thee

me
my
edris
thou
who
art
so
so
hear
me
help
me

me
i
am
all
thine
say
didst
thou
not
summon
me
to
meet
thee
here
upon
this
wondrous
field
of
ardath
did
i
not
come
hither
according
to
thy
words
and
have
i
not
seen
things
that
i
am
not
able
to
express
or
understand
teach
me
wise
and
beloved
one
i
doubt
no
more
i
know
myself
and
thee
thou
art
an
angel
but
i
alas
what
am
i
a
grain
of
sand
in
thy
sight
and
in
god
a
mere
nothing
comprehending
nothing
unable
even
to
realize
the
extent
of
my
own
nothingness
edris
o
edris
thou
canst
not
love
me
thou
mayst
pity
me
perchance
and
pardon
and
bless
me
gently
in
christ
dear
name
but
love
thy
love
oh
let
me
not
aspire
to
such
heights
of
joy
where
i
have
no
place
no
right
no
worthiness
no
worthiness
echoed
edris
what
a
rapture
trembled
through
her
sweet
caressing
voice
my
theos
who
is
so
worthy
to
win
back
what
is
thine
own
as
thou
all
heaven
has
wondered
at
thy
voluntary
exile
thy
place
in
god
supernal
sphere
has
long
been
vacant
thy
right
to
dwell
there
none
have
questioned
thy
throne
is
empty
thy
crown
unclaimed
thou
art
an
angel
even
as
i
but
thou
art
in
bonds
while
i
am
free
ah
how
sad
and
strange
it
is
to
me
to
see
thee
here
thus
fettered
to
the
sorrowful
star
when
countless
aeons
since
thou
mightest
have
enjoyed
full
liberty
in
the
eternal
light
of
the
everlasting
paradise
he
listened
a
strong
sweet
hope
began
to
kindle
in
him
like
flame
but
he
made
no
answer
only
he
caught
and
kissed
the
edge
of
her
garment
its
soft
gray
cloudy
texture
brushed
his
lips
with
the
odorous
coolness
of
a
furled
roseleaf
she
seemed
to
tremble
at
his
action
but
he
dared
not
look
up
presently
he
felt
the
pulsing
pressure
of
her
hands
upon
his
head
and
a
rush
of
strange
warm
vigor
thrilled
through
his
veins
like
an
electric
flash
of
new
and
life
thou
wouldst
seek
after
and
know
the
truth
she
said
truth
celestial
truth
unchangeable
truth
that
permeates
and
underlies
all
the
mystic
inward
workings
of
the
universe
workings
and
secret
laws
unguessed
by
man
vast
as
eternity
is
this
truth
ungraspable
in
all
its
manifestations
by
the
merely
mortal
intelligence
nevertheless
thy
spirit
being
chastened
to
noble
humility
and
repentance
hath
risen
to
new
heights
of
comprehension
whence
thou
canst
partly
penetrate
into
the
wonders
of
worlds
unseen
did
i
not
tell
thee
to
from
the
perils
of
the
past
the
perils
of
the
future
and
understandest
thou
not
the
lesson
of
the
vision
of
thou
hast
seen
the
of
thy
former
and
glory
in
old
time
thou
wert
an
agony
of
shame
possessed
him
as
he
heard
his
soul
at
once
seized
the
solution
of
the
mystery
his
quickened
thought
plunged
straight
through
the
depths
of
the
bewildering
phantasmagoria
in
which
mere
reason
had
been
of
no
practical
avail
and
straightway
sounded
its
whole
seemingly
complex
but
actually
simple
meaning
he
was
or
rather
he
had
been
in
some
far
stretch
of
time
and
in
his
dream
of
a
single
night
he
had
loved
the
brilliant
phantom
of
his
former
self
more
than
his
own
present
identity
not
less
remarkable
was
the
fact
that
in
this
strange
he
had
imagined
himself
to
be
perfectly
unselfish
whereas
all
the
while
he
had
honored
flattered
and
admired
the
more
appearance
of
himself
more
than
anything
or
everything
in
the
world
ay
even
his
occasional
reluctant
reproaches
to
himself
in
the
ghostly
impersonation
of
had
been
far
more
tender
than
severe
o
deep
and
bitter
ingloriousness
o
speechless
degradation
of
all
the
higher
capabilities
of
man
to
love
one
own
ephemeral
so
utterly
as
to
exclude
from
thought
and
sympathy
all
other
things
whether
human
or
divine
and
was
it
not
possible
that
this
spectre
of
self
might
still
be
clinging
to
him
was
it
dead
with
the
dream
of
or
had
never
truly
died
at
all
and
was
the
fine
essence
that
had
formed
the
spirit
of
the
laureate
of
yet
part
of
the
living
substance
of
his
present
nature
he
a
english
poet
of
the
nineteenth
century
did
all
light
follies
idle
passions
and
careless
cruelties
remain
inherent
in
him
had
he
the
same
pride
of
intellect
the
same
the
same
indifference
to
god
and
man
oh
no
no
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
and
his
head
sank
lower
and
lower
beneath
the
benediction
touch
of
her
whose
tenderness
revived
his
noblest
energies
and
lit
anew
in
his
heart
the
pure
bright
fire
of
aspiration
thou
wert
went
on
the
mildly
earnest
voice
and
all
the
wide
ungrudging
fame
given
to
earth
great
poets
in
ancient
days
was
thine
thy
name
was
on
all
men
mouths
thou
wert
honored
by
kings
thou
wert
the
chief
glory
of
a
great
people
great
though
misled
by
their
own
false
opinions
and
the
city
of
of
which
thou
wert
the
enshrined
jewel
was
mightier
far
than
any
now
built
upon
the
earth
christ
had
not
come
to
thee
save
by
dim
types
and
vague
prefigurements
which
only
praying
prophets
could
discern
but
god
had
spoken
to
thy
soul
in
quiet
moments
and
thou
wouldst
neither
hear
him
nor
believe
in
him
i
had
called
thee
but
thou
wouldst
not
listen
thou
didst
foolishly
prefer
to
hearken
to
the
clamorous
tempting
of
thine
own
beguiling
human
passions
and
wert
altogether
deaf
to
an
angel
whisper
things
of
the
earth
earthly
gained
dominion
over
thee
by
them
thou
wert
led
astray
deceived
and
at
last
forsaken
the
genius
god
gave
thee
thou
didst
misuse
and
indolently
waste
thy
brief
life
came
as
thou
hast
seen
to
end
and
the
proud
city
of
thy
dwelling
was
destroyed
by
fire
not
a
trace
of
it
was
left
to
mark
the
spot
where
once
it
stood
the
foundations
of
babylon
were
laid
above
it
and
no
man
guessed
that
it
had
ever
been
and
thy
poems
the
fruit
of
thy
but
carelessly
accepted
inspiration
who
is
there
that
remembers
them
no
one
save
thou
thou
hast
recovered
them
like
sunken
pearls
from
the
profound
ocean
of
limitless
memory
and
to
the
world
of
thou
dost
repeat
the
music
to
which
listened
entranced
so
many
thousands
of
generations
ago
a
deep
sigh
that
was
half
a
groan
broke
from
his
lips
he
could
now
take
the
measurement
of
his
own
utter
littleness
and
incompetency
he
could
create
nothing
new
everything
he
had
written
as
he
fancied
only
just
lately
had
been
written
by
himself
before
the
problem
of
the
poem
nourhalma
was
explained
he
had
designed
it
when
he
had
played
his
part
on
the
stage
of
life
as
and
perhaps
not
even
then
for
the
first
time
in
this
knowledge
there
was
only
one
consolation
namely
that
if
his
dream
was
a
true
reflection
of
his
past
and
exact
in
details
as
he
felt
it
must
be
then
nourhalma
had
not
been
given
to
it
had
been
composed
but
not
made
public
hence
so
far
it
was
new
to
the
world
though
not
new
to
himself
yet
he
had
considered
it
wondrously
new
a
perfectly
original
idea
ah
who
dares
to
boast
of
any
idea
as
humanly
original
seeing
that
all
ideas
whatsoever
must
be
referred
back
to
god
and
admitted
as
his
and
his
only
what
is
the
wisest
man
that
ever
lived
but
a
small
pale
mirror
of
the
eternal
thought
that
controls
and
dominates
all
things
he
remembered
with
confusion
what
pleasure
he
had
felt
what
placid
satisfaction
what
unqualified
admiration
when
listening
to
his
own
works
recited
by
the
of
his
former
self
pleasure
that
had
certainly
exceeded
whatever
pain
he
had
suffered
by
the
then
enigmatical
and
perplexing
nature
of
the
incident
o
what
a
foolish
atom
he
now
seemed
viewed
by
the
standard
of
his
newly
aroused
higher
consciousness
how
poor
and
passive
a
slave
to
the
glittering
beckoning
phantasm
of
his
own
perishable
fame
thus
on
the
field
of
ardath
he
drained
the
cup
of
humility
to
the
dregs
the
cup
which
like
that
offered
to
the
prophet
of
holy
writ
was
full
as
it
were
with
water
but
the
color
of
it
was
like
fire
the
water
of
the
fire
of
faith
and
with
that
prophet
he
might
have
when
i
had
drunk
of
it
my
heart
uttered
understanding
and
wisdom
grew
in
my
breast
for
my
spirit
strengthened
my
memory
meanwhile
edris
still
keeping
her
gentle
hands
on
his
bent
head
went
on
in
such
wise
didst
thou
my
beloved
as
the
famous
mournfully
and
the
nations
remembered
thee
no
more
but
thy
spiritual
indestructible
essence
lived
on
and
wandered
dismayed
and
forlorn
through
a
myriad
forms
of
existence
in
the
depths
of
perpetual
darkness
which
must
be
even
as
the
everlasting
light
is
thy
immortal
but
perverted
will
bore
thee
always
further
from
god
further
from
him
and
so
far
from
me
that
thou
wert
at
times
beyond
even
an
ken
ages
upon
ages
rolled
away
the
centuries
between
earth
and
earths
purposed
redemption
passed
and
though
in
heaven
these
measured
spaces
of
time
that
appear
so
great
to
men
are
as
a
mere
world
month
of
summer
still
to
me
for
once
god
golden
days
seemed
long
i
had
lost
thee
thou
wert
my
soul
other
soul
my
king
my
immortality
completion
and
though
thou
wert
alas
a
fallen
brightness
yet
i
held
fast
to
my
one
hope
the
hope
in
thy
diviner
nature
which
though
sorely
overcome
was
not
and
could
not
be
wholly
destroyed
i
knew
the
fate
in
store
for
thee
i
knew
that
thou
with
other
erring
spirits
wert
bound
to
live
again
on
earth
when
christ
had
built
his
holy
way
therefrom
to
heaven
and
never
did
i
cease
for
thy
dear
sake
to
wait
and
watch
and
pray
at
last
i
found
thee
but
ah
how
i
trembled
for
thy
destiny
to
thee
had
been
delivered
as
to
all
the
children
of
men
the
final
message
of
the
message
of
love
and
pardon
which
made
all
the
angels
wonder
but
thou
didst
utterly
reject
it
and
with
the
same
willful
arrogance
of
thy
former
self
thou
wert
blindly
and
desperately
turning
anew
into
darkness
o
my
beloved
that
darkness
might
have
been
eternal
and
crowded
with
memories
dating
from
the
very
beginning
of
life
nay
let
me
not
speak
of
that
supernal
agony
since
christ
hath
died
to
quench
its
terrors
enough
by
happy
chance
through
my
desire
thine
own
roused
better
will
and
the
strength
of
one
who
hath
many
friends
in
heaven
thy
spirit
was
released
to
temporary
liberty
and
in
thy
vision
at
dariel
which
was
no
vision
but
a
truth
i
bade
thee
meet
me
here
and
why
solely
to
test
thy
power
of
obedience
to
a
divine
impulse
unexplainable
by
human
reason
and
i
rejoiced
as
only
angels
can
rejoice
when
of
thine
own
thou
didst
keep
the
tryst
i
made
with
thee
yet
thou
knewest
me
not
or
rather
thou
wouldst
not
know
me
till
i
left
thee
is
ever
the
way
of
mortals
to
doubt
their
angels
in
disguise
her
sweet
accents
shook
with
a
liquid
thrill
suggestive
of
tears
but
he
was
silent
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
be
well
content
to
hold
his
place
forever
if
forever
he
might
hear
her
thus
melodiously
speak
on
had
she
not
called
him
her
other
soul
her
king
her
completion
and
on
those
wondrous
words
of
hers
his
spirit
hung
impassioned
dazzled
and
entranced
beyond
all
time
and
space
and
nature
and
experience
after
a
brief
pause
during
which
his
ravished
mind
floated
among
the
thousand
images
and
vague
feelings
of
a
whole
past
and
future
merged
in
one
splendid
and
celestial
present
she
resumed
always
softly
and
with
the
same
exquisite
tenderness
of
tone
i
left
thee
dearest
but
a
moment
and
in
that
moment
he
who
hath
himself
shared
in
human
sorrows
and
sympathies
he
who
is
the
embodiment
of
the
essence
of
god
love
came
to
my
aid
plunging
thy
senses
in
deep
sleep
as
hath
been
done
before
to
many
a
saint
and
prophet
of
old
time
here
on
this
very
field
of
ardath
he
summoned
up
before
thee
the
phantoms
of
a
portion
of
thy
past
phantoms
which
to
thee
seemed
far
more
real
than
the
living
presence
of
thy
faithful
edris
alas
my
beloved
thou
art
not
the
only
one
on
the
sorrowful
star
who
accepts
a
dream
for
reality
and
rejects
reality
as
a
dream
she
paused
again
and
again
continued
nevertheless
in
some
degree
thy
vision
of
was
true
inasmuch
as
thou
wert
shown
therein
as
in
a
mirror
one
phase
one
only
of
thy
former
existence
upon
earth
the
final
episode
was
chosen
as
by
the
end
of
a
man
days
alone
shall
he
be
judged
as
much
as
thy
was
able
to
see
as
much
as
thy
brain
was
able
to
bear
appeared
before
thee
but
that
thou
slumbering
wert
yet
a
conscious
personality
among
phantoms
and
that
these
phantoms
spoke
to
thee
charmed
thee
bewildered
thee
tempted
thee
and
swayed
thee
this
was
the
divine
master
work
upon
thine
own
retrospective
thought
and
memory
he
gave
the
shadows
of
thy
bygone
life
seeming
color
sense
motion
and
speech
he
blotted
out
from
thy
remembrance
his
own
most
holy
name
and
shutting
up
the
present
from
thy
gaze
he
sent
thy
spirit
back
into
the
past
there
thou
perplexed
and
sorrowful
didst
painfully
the
last
fragments
of
thy
former
history
and
not
till
thou
hadst
abandoned
the
shadow
of
thyself
didst
thou
escape
from
the
fear
of
destruction
then
when
apparently
all
alone
and
utterly
forsaken
a
cloud
of
angels
circled
round
thee
then
at
thy
first
repentant
cry
for
help
he
who
has
never
left
an
earnest
prayer
unanswered
bade
me
descend
hither
to
waken
and
comfort
thee
oh
never
was
his
bidding
more
joyously
obeyed
now
i
have
plainly
shown
thee
the
interpretation
of
thy
dream
and
dost
thou
not
comprehend
the
intention
of
the
highest
in
manifesting
it
unto
thee
remember
the
words
of
god
prophet
of
old
the
field
thou
thoughtest
barren
how
great
a
glory
hath
the
moon
unveiled
i
beheld
and
was
sore
amazed
for
i
was
no
longer
myself
but
another
the
sword
of
death
was
in
that
other
soul
and
yet
that
other
was
but
myself
in
pain
i
knew
not
the
things
which
were
once
familiar
and
my
heart
failed
within
me
for
very
fear
she
spoke
the
quaint
and
mystic
lines
with
a
grave
pure
rhythmic
utterance
that
was
like
the
singing
of
sweet
psalmody
and
when
she
ceased
the
stillness
that
followed
seemed
quivering
with
the
rich
vibrations
of
her
voice
the
very
air
was
surely
rendered
softer
and
more
delicate
by
such
sound
but
theos
who
had
listened
dumbly
until
now
began
to
feel
a
sudden
sorrowful
aching
at
his
heart
a
sense
of
coming
desolation
a
consciousness
that
she
would
soon
depart
again
and
leave
him
and
with
a
mingled
reverence
and
passion
he
ventured
to
draw
one
of
the
fair
hands
that
rested
on
his
brows
down
into
his
own
clasp
he
met
with
no
resistance
and
he
pressed
his
lips
upon
its
soft
and
dazzling
whiteness
while
the
longing
of
his
soul
broke
forth
in
words
of
fervid
irrepressible
appeal
edris
he
if
thou
dost
love
me
give
me
my
death
here
now
at
thy
feet
where
i
kneel
of
what
avail
is
it
for
me
to
struggle
in
this
dark
and
difficult
world
o
deprive
me
of
this
fluctuating
breath
called
life
and
let
me
live
indeed
i
i
know
all
thou
hast
said
i
have
learned
my
own
sins
as
in
a
glass
darkly
i
have
lived
on
earth
before
and
as
it
seems
made
no
good
use
of
life
and
now
now
i
have
found
thee
then
why
must
i
lose
thee
thou
who
camest
to
me
so
sweetly
at
the
first
nay
i
can
not
part
from
thee
i
will
not
if
thou
leavest
me
i
have
no
strength
to
follow
thee
i
shall
but
miss
the
way
to
thine
abode
thou
canst
not
miss
the
way
responded
edris
softly
look
up
my
theos
be
of
good
cheer
thou
poet
to
whom
heaven
greatest
gifts
of
song
are
now
accorded
look
up
and
tell
me
is
not
the
way
made
plain
slowly
and
in
reverential
fear
he
obeyed
and
raised
his
eyes
still
holding
her
by
the
hand
and
saw
behind
her
a
distinctly
marked
shadow
that
seemed
flung
downward
by
the
reflection
of
some
brilliant
light
above
the
shadow
of
a
cross
against
which
her
delicate
figure
stood
forth
in
shining
outlines
seeing
he
understood
but
nevertheless
his
mind
grew
more
and
more
disquieted
a
thousand
misgivings
crowded
upon
him
he
thought
of
the
world
he
remembered
what
it
was
he
was
living
in
an
age
of
heresy
and
wanton
unbelief
where
not
only
christ
divinity
was
made
blasphemous
mock
of
but
where
even
god
existence
was
itself
called
in
and
as
for
angels
a
sort
of
shock
ran
through
his
nerves
as
he
reflected
that
though
preachers
preached
concerning
these
supernatural
beings
though
the
very
birth
of
christ
rested
on
testimony
though
poets
wrote
of
them
and
painters
strove
to
delineate
them
on
their
most
famous
canvases
each
and
all
thus
practically
demonstrating
the
secret
instinctive
intuition
of
humanity
that
such
celestial
forms
are
yet
it
was
most
absolutely
certain
that
not
a
man
in
the
prosaic
nineteenth
century
would
if
asked
admit
to
any
actual
belief
in
their
existence
inconsistent
yes
but
are
not
men
more
inconsistent
than
the
very
beasts
of
the
field
their
tyranny
controls
what
as
a
rule
do
men
believe
in
themselves
only
themselves
they
are
in
their
own
opinion
the
and
the
of
everything
as
if
the
supreme
creative
force
called
god
were
incapable
of
designing
any
higher
form
of
than
their
pigmy
bodies
which
strut
on
two
legs
and
with
two
eyes
and
a
small
quickly
staggered
brain
profess
to
understand
and
weigh
the
whole
foundation
and
plan
of
the
universe
growing
swiftly
conscious
of
all
that
in
the
purgatory
of
the
present
awaited
him
theos
felt
as
though
the
that
had
swallowed
up
in
his
dream
had
opened
again
before
him
affrighting
him
with
its
black
depth
of
nothingness
and
annihilation
and
in
a
sudden
agony
of
he
gazed
yearningly
at
the
fair
wistful
face
above
him
the
divine
beauty
that
was
his
after
all
if
he
only
knew
how
to
claim
it
something
he
knew
not
what
filled
him
with
a
fiery
restlessness
a
passion
of
protest
and
aspiration
which
for
a
moment
was
so
strong
that
it
seemed
to
him
he
must
with
one
fierce
effort
wrench
himself
free
from
the
trammels
of
mortality
and
straightway
take
upon
him
the
majesty
of
immortal
nature
and
so
bear
his
angel
love
company
whithersoever
she
went
never
had
the
fetters
of
flesh
weighed
upon
him
with
but
in
spite
of
his
feverish
longing
to
escape
some
authoritative
yet
gentle
force
held
him
prisoner
god
he
muttered
why
am
i
thus
bound
why
can
i
not
be
free
because
thy
time
for
freedom
has
not
come
said
edris
quickly
answering
his
thought
because
thou
hast
work
to
do
that
is
not
yet
done
thy
poet
labors
have
up
till
now
been
merely
repetition
the
repetition
of
thy
former
self
go
the
tired
world
waits
for
a
new
gospel
of
poesy
a
new
song
that
shall
rouse
it
from
its
apathy
and
bring
it
closer
unto
god
and
all
things
high
and
fair
write
for
the
nations
wait
for
a
of
truth
the
great
poets
are
dead
their
spirits
are
in
heaven
and
there
is
none
to
replace
them
on
the
sorrowful
star
save
thou
not
for
fame
do
thy
work
nor
for
wealth
but
for
love
and
the
glory
of
god
for
love
of
humanity
for
love
of
the
beautiful
the
pure
the
holy
let
the
race
of
men
hear
one
more
faithful
apostle
of
the
divine
unseen
ere
earth
is
lost
in
the
withering
light
of
a
larger
creation
go
perform
thy
mission
that
mission
of
all
poets
worthy
the
to
raise
the
world
thou
shalt
not
lack
strength
nor
fervor
so
long
as
thou
dost
write
for
the
benefit
of
others
serve
god
and
live
serve
self
and
die
such
is
the
eternal
law
of
spheres
invisible
the
less
thou
seest
of
self
the
more
thou
seest
of
heaven
thrust
self
away
and
lo
god
invests
thee
with
his
presence
go
forth
into
the
world
a
king
uncrowned
a
master
of
song
and
fear
not
that
i
edris
will
forsake
thee
i
who
have
loved
thee
since
the
birth
of
time
he
met
her
beautiful
luminous
inspired
eyes
with
a
sad
interrogativeness
in
his
own
what
a
hard
fate
was
meted
out
to
him
to
teach
the
world
that
scoffed
at
teaching
to
rouse
the
mass
of
men
to
a
new
sense
of
things
divine
o
vain
task
o
dreary
impossibility
enough
surely
to
guide
his
own
will
aright
without
making
any
attempt
to
guide
the
wills
of
others
her
mandate
seemed
to
him
almost
cruel
it
was
like
driving
him
into
a
howling
wilderness
when
with
one
touch
one
kiss
she
might
transport
him
into
paradise
if
she
were
in
the
world
if
she
were
always
with
ah
then
how
different
how
easy
life
would
be
again
he
thought
of
those
strange
entrancing
words
of
my
other
soul
my
my
immortality
completion
and
a
sudden
wild
idea
took
swift
possession
of
his
brain
edris
he
if
i
may
not
yet
come
to
thee
then
come
thou
to
me
dwell
thou
with
me
o
by
the
force
of
my
love
which
god
knoweth
let
me
draw
thee
thou
fair
light
into
my
heart
gloom
hear
me
while
i
swear
my
faith
to
thee
as
at
some
holy
shrine
as
i
live
with
all
my
soul
i
do
accept
thy
master
christ
as
mine
utmost
good
and
his
cross
as
my
proudest
glory
but
yet
bethink
thee
edris
bethink
thee
of
this
world
its
wilful
sin
its
scorn
of
god
and
all
the
evil
that
like
a
spreading
darkens
it
day
by
day
oh
wilt
thou
leave
me
desolate
and
alone
fight
as
i
will
i
shall
often
sink
under
blows
conquer
as
i
may
i
shall
suffer
the
solitude
of
conquest
unless
thou
art
with
me
oh
speak
is
there
no
deeper
divine
intention
in
the
marvellous
destiny
that
has
brought
us
together
thou
pure
spirit
and
i
weak
mortal
has
love
the
primal
mover
of
all
things
no
hold
upon
thee
if
i
am
as
thou
sayest
thy
beloved
loved
by
thee
so
long
even
while
forgetful
of
and
unworthy
of
thy
love
can
i
not
now
now
when
i
am
all
thine
persuade
thee
to
compassionate
the
rest
of
my
brief
life
on
earth
thou
art
in
woman
shape
here
on
this
field
of
ardath
and
yet
thou
art
not
woman
oh
could
my
love
constrain
thee
in
god
name
to
wear
the
mask
of
mortal
body
for
my
sake
would
not
our
union
even
now
make
the
sorrowful
star
seem
fair
love
love
love
come
to
mine
aid
and
teach
me
how
to
shut
the
wings
of
this
sweet
bird
of
paradise
in
mine
own
breast
god
spare
her
to
me
for
one
of
thy
sweet
moments
which
are
our
mortal
years
christ
who
became
a
mere
child
for
pity
of
us
let
me
learn
from
thee
the
mystic
spell
that
makes
thine
angel
mine
carried
away
by
his
own
forceful
emotion
he
hardly
knew
what
he
said
but
an
unspeakable
dizzy
joy
flooded
his
soul
as
he
caught
the
look
she
gave
him
a
wild
sweet
amazed
wholly
human
look
suggestive
of
the
most
marvellous
possibilities
one
effort
and
she
released
her
hand
from
his
and
moved
a
little
apart
her
eyes
kindling
with
celestial
sympathy
in
which
there
was
the
very
faintest
touch
of
what
from
an
angel
to
a
mortal
ah
no
it
could
not
be
yet
he
felt
filled
all
at
once
with
a
terrible
sense
of
power
that
at
the
same
time
was
mingled
with
the
deepest
humility
and
fear
hush
she
said
and
her
lovely
low
voice
was
tremulous
hush
thou
dost
speak
as
if
we
were
already
in
world
i
love
thee
theos
and
truly
because
thou
art
prisoned
here
i
love
the
sad
earth
also
but
dost
thou
think
to
what
thou
wouldst
so
eagerly
persuade
me
to
live
a
mortal
life
to
die
to
pass
through
the
darkest
phase
of
known
in
all
the
teeming
spheres
nay
and
a
look
of
pathetic
sorrow
came
over
her
how
could
i
even
for
thee
my
theos
forsake
my
home
in
heaven
her
last
words
were
her
manner
was
as
of
one
in
and
theos
kneeling
still
surveyed
her
in
worshipping
silence
then
he
suddenly
remembered
what
the
monk
and
mystic
heliobas
had
said
to
him
at
dariel
on
the
morning
after
his
trance
of
if
as
i
conjecture
you
have
seen
one
of
the
fair
inhabitants
of
higher
spheres
than
ours
you
would
not
drag
her
spiritual
and
brightness
down
to
the
level
of
the
of
a
mere
human
life
nay
if
you
would
you
could
not
and
now
strange
to
say
he
felt
that
he
could
but
would
not
and
he
was
overcome
with
remorse
and
penitence
for
the
egotistical
nature
of
his
own
appeal
my
love
my
life
he
said
brokenly
forgive
me
forgive
my
selfish
prayer
self
spoke
not
i
yet
i
had
thought
self
dead
and
buried
forever
a
faint
sigh
escaped
him
believe
me
sweet
i
would
not
have
thee
lose
one
hour
of
heaven
ecstasies
i
would
not
have
thee
saddened
by
earth
wilful
miseries
no
not
even
for
that
which
numbers
up
man
mortal
days
speed
back
to
my
edris
i
will
love
thee
till
i
die
and
leave
the
afterward
to
christ
be
glad
thou
fairest
dearest
one
unfurl
thy
rainbow
wings
and
fly
from
me
and
wander
singing
through
the
groves
of
heaven
making
all
heaven
musical
perchance
in
the
silence
of
the
night
i
may
catch
the
echo
of
thy
voice
and
fancy
thou
art
near
and
trust
me
edris
trust
me
for
my
faith
will
not
falter
my
hope
shall
not
waver
and
though
in
the
world
i
may
i
must
have
tribulation
yet
will
i
believe
in
him
who
hath
by
simple
love
overcome
the
world
he
ceased
a
great
quiet
seemed
to
fall
upon
him
the
quiet
of
a
deep
and
passive
resignation
edris
drew
nearer
to
him
timidly
as
a
shy
bird
yet
with
a
wonderful
smile
quivering
on
her
lips
and
in
the
clear
depths
of
her
starry
eyes
very
gently
she
placed
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
looked
down
at
him
with
divinely
compassionate
tenderness
thou
beloved
one
she
said
thou
whose
spirit
was
formerly
equal
to
mine
and
to
all
angels
in
god
sight
though
through
pride
it
fell
learn
that
thou
art
nearer
to
me
now
than
thou
hast
been
for
a
myriad
ages
between
us
are
renewed
the
strong
sweet
ties
that
shall
nevermore
be
broken
unless
and
her
voice
faltered
unless
thou
of
thine
own
free
will
break
them
again
in
spite
of
all
my
prayers
for
because
thou
art
immortal
even
as
i
though
thou
art
pent
up
in
mortality
even
so
must
thy
will
remain
immortally
unfettered
and
what
thou
dost
firmly
elect
to
do
god
will
not
prevent
the
dream
of
thy
past
was
a
lesson
not
a
command
thou
art
free
to
forget
or
remember
it
as
thou
wilt
while
on
earth
since
it
is
only
after
death
that
memory
is
ineffaceable
and
with
its
companion
remorse
constitutes
hell
obey
god
or
disobey
him
he
will
not
force
thee
either
way
constrained
love
hath
no
value
only
this
is
the
universal
law
that
whosoever
disobeys
his
disobedience
recoils
on
his
own
head
as
of
necessity
it
must
whereas
obedience
is
the
working
in
perfect
harmony
with
all
nature
and
of
equal
necessity
brings
its
own
reward
cling
to
the
cross
for
one
the
moment
called
by
mortals
life
and
it
shall
lift
thee
straightway
into
highest
heaven
there
will
i
wait
for
thee
and
there
thou
shalt
make
me
thine
own
forever
he
sighed
and
gazed
at
her
wistfully
alas
my
edris
not
till
then
he
murmured
she
bent
over
him
and
kissed
his
forehead
a
caress
as
brief
and
light
as
the
passing
flutter
of
a
bird
wing
not
till
then
she
whispered
unless
the
longing
of
thy
love
compels
he
started
what
did
she
mean
his
eyes
flashed
eager
inquiry
into
hers
so
soft
and
brilliantly
clear
with
the
light
of
an
eternal
peace
dwelling
in
their
liquid
mysterious
loveliness
and
meeting
his
questioning
look
the
angelic
smile
brightened
more
gloriously
round
her
lips
but
there
was
now
something
altogether
unearthly
in
her
beauty
a
wondrous
inward
luminousness
began
to
transfigure
her
face
and
form
he
saw
her
garments
whiten
to
a
sparkling
radiance
as
of
sunbeams
on
snow
the
halo
round
her
bright
hair
deepened
into
glory
her
stature
grew
loftier
and
became
as
it
were
endowed
with
supreme
and
splendid
majesty
and
the
exquisite
fairness
of
her
countenance
waxed
warmly
transparent
with
the
delicate
hue
of
a
white
rose
through
which
the
pink
color
faintly
flushes
soft
suggestions
of
ruddier
life
his
gaze
dwelt
upon
her
in
unspeakable
wondering
adoration
mingled
with
a
sense
of
irrepressible
sorrow
and
heaviness
of
heart
he
felt
she
was
about
to
leave
him
and
was
it
not
a
parting
of
soul
from
soul
just
then
the
sun
stepped
royally
forth
from
between
the
red
and
gold
curtains
of
the
east
and
in
that
blaze
of
earth
her
figure
became
resplendently
invested
with
vivid
rays
of
roseate
lustre
that
far
surpassed
the
amber
shining
of
the
orb
of
day
awed
dazzled
and
utterly
overcome
he
yet
strove
to
keep
his
straining
eyes
steadily
upon
her
conscious
that
her
smile
still
blessed
him
with
its
tenderness
he
made
a
wild
effort
to
drag
himself
nearer
to
her
to
touch
once
more
the
glittering
edge
of
her
robe
to
detain
her
one
little
little
moment
longer
ah
how
wistfully
how
fondly
she
looked
upon
him
almost
it
seemed
as
if
she
might
after
all
consent
to
stay
he
stretched
out
his
arms
with
a
pathetic
gesture
of
love
fear
and
supplication
edris
edris
he
cried
half
despairingly
oh
by
the
strength
of
thine
angelhood
have
pity
on
the
weakness
of
my
manhood
surely
she
heard
or
seemed
to
hear
and
yet
she
gave
no
answer
no
sign
no
promise
no
gesture
of
farewell
only
a
look
of
divine
compassionating
perfect
love
a
look
so
pure
so
penetrating
so
true
so
rapturous
that
flesh
and
blood
could
bear
the
glory
of
her
transfigured
presence
no
longer
and
blind
with
the
burning
effulgence
of
her
beauty
he
shut
his
eyes
and
covered
his
face
he
knew
now
if
he
had
never
known
it
before
what
was
meant
by
an
angel
standing
in
the
sun
footnote
revelation
chap
moreover
he
also
knew
that
what
humanity
calls
miracles
are
possible
and
do
happen
and
that
instead
of
being
violations
of
the
law
of
nature
as
we
understand
it
they
are
but
confirmations
of
that
law
in
its
deeper
depths
depths
which
controlled
by
spiritual
force
alone
have
not
as
yet
been
sounded
by
the
most
searching
scientists
and
what
is
material
force
but
the
visible
manifestation
of
the
spiritual
behind
it
he
who
accepts
the
material
and
denies
the
spiritual
is
in
the
untenable
position
of
one
who
admits
an
effect
and
denies
a
cause
and
if
both
spiritual
and
material
be
accepted
then
how
can
we
reasonably
dare
to
set
a
limit
to
the
manifestations
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
when
he
at
last
looked
up
edris
had
vanished
he
was
alone
alone
on
the
field
of
ardath
the
field
that
was
barren
in
very
truth
now
she
his
angel
had
been
drawn
away
as
it
seemed
into
the
sunlight
absorbed
like
a
into
those
rays
of
gold
that
lit
and
warmed
the
reddening
earth
and
heaven
slowly
and
dizzily
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
gazed
about
him
in
vague
bewilderment
he
had
passed
one
night
on
the
field
one
night
only
and
he
felt
as
though
he
had
lived
through
years
of
experience
now
the
vision
was
ended
edris
the
reality
had
fled
and
the
world
was
before
him
the
world
with
all
the
unsatisfying
things
it
grudgingly
offers
the
world
in
which
had
been
a
city
magnificent
in
the
centuries
gone
and
in
which
he
too
had
played
his
part
before
and
had
won
fame
to
be
forgotten
as
soon
as
dead
fame
how
he
had
longed
and
thirsted
for
it
and
what
a
foolish
undesirable
distinction
it
seemed
to
him
now
steadying
his
thoughts
by
a
few
moments
of
calm
reflection
he
remembered
what
he
had
in
charge
to
do
to
redeem
his
past
to
use
and
expend
whatever
force
was
in
him
for
the
good
the
help
the
consolement
and
the
love
of
others
not
to
benefit
himself
this
was
his
task
and
the
very
comprehension
of
it
gave
him
a
rush
of
vigor
and
virile
energy
that
at
once
lifted
the
cloud
of
from
his
soul
my
edris
he
thou
shalt
have
no
cause
to
weep
for
me
in
heaven
again
with
god
help
i
will
win
back
my
lost
heritage
as
he
spoke
the
words
his
eyes
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
white
on
the
turf
where
but
a
moment
since
his
had
stood
he
stooped
toward
it
it
was
one
bud
of
the
wonderful
that
had
covered
the
field
in
such
singular
profusion
on
the
previous
night
when
she
first
appeared
one
only
might
he
not
gather
it
he
hesitated
then
very
gently
and
reverently
broke
it
off
and
tenderly
bore
it
to
his
lips
what
a
beautiful
blossom
it
was
its
fragrance
was
unlike
that
of
any
other
flower
its
whiteness
was
more
pure
and
soft
than
that
of
the
rarest
edelweiss
on
alpine
snows
and
its
partially
disclosed
golden
centre
had
an
almost
luminous
brightness
as
he
held
it
in
his
hand
all
sorts
of
vague
delicious
thoughts
came
sweeping
across
his
brain
thoughts
that
seemed
to
set
themselves
to
music
wild
and
strange
and
new
and
suggestive
of
the
sweetest
noblest
influences
a
thrill
of
expectation
stirred
in
him
as
of
great
and
good
things
to
be
done
grand
changes
to
be
wrought
in
the
complex
web
of
human
destiny
brought
about
by
the
quickening
and
development
of
a
pure
unselfish
spiritual
force
that
might
with
saving
benefit
flow
into
the
perplexed
and
weary
intelligence
of
man
and
cheered
invigorated
and
conscious
of
a
circling
widening
supreme
power
that
with
love
was
ever
on
the
side
of
work
done
for
love
sake
he
gently
shut
the
flower
within
his
breast
resolving
to
carry
it
with
him
wheresoever
he
went
as
a
token
and
proof
of
the
signs
and
wonders
of
the
prophet
field
and
now
he
prepared
to
quit
the
scene
of
his
mystic
vision
in
which
he
had
followed
with
prescient
pain
the
brief
bright
career
the
useless
fame
the
evil
and
final
fate
of
his
former
self
and
crossing
the
field
with
lingering
tread
he
looked
back
many
times
to
the
fallen
block
of
stone
where
he
had
sat
when
he
had
first
perceived
god
maiden
edris
stepping
softly
through
the
bloom
when
should
he
again
meet
her
alas
not
till
death
the
beautiful
and
beneficent
herald
of
true
liberty
summoned
him
to
those
lofty
heights
of
paradise
where
she
had
habitation
not
till
then
unless
unless
and
his
heart
beat
with
a
sudden
tumult
as
he
recollected
her
last
words
unless
the
longing
of
thy
love
compels
could
love
compel
her
he
wondered
to
come
to
him
once
more
while
yet
he
lived
on
earth
perhaps
and
yet
if
he
indeed
had
such
power
of
love
would
it
be
generous
or
just
to
exert
it
no
for
to
draw
her
down
from
heaven
to
earth
seemed
to
him
now
a
sort
of
sacrilege
dearer
to
him
was
her
joy
than
his
own
but
suppose
the
possibility
of
her
being
actually
happy
with
him
in
mortal
existence
suppose
that
love
when
absolutely
pure
unselfishly
mutual
helpful
and
steadfast
had
it
in
its
gift
to
make
even
the
sorrowful
star
a
heaven
in
miniature
what
then
he
would
not
trust
himself
to
think
of
this
the
mere
shadowy
suggestion
of
such
supreme
delight
filled
him
with
a
strong
passion
of
yearning
to
which
in
his
accepted
creed
of
he
dared
not
yield
firmly
restraining
resisting
and
renouncing
his
own
desires
he
mentally
raised
a
holy
shrine
for
her
in
his
soul
a
shrine
of
pure
faith
warm
with
eternal
aspirations
and
bright
with
truth
wherein
he
hallowed
the
memory
of
her
beauty
with
a
sense
of
devout
gladness
she
was
she
was
content
she
blossomed
in
the
highest
gardens
of
god
where
all
things
fared
well
enough
for
him
to
worship
her
at
a
distance
to
keep
the
clear
reflection
of
her
loveliness
in
his
mind
and
to
live
so
that
he
might
deserve
to
follow
and
find
her
when
his
work
on
earth
was
done
moreover
heaven
to
him
was
no
longer
a
vague
mythical
realm
by
the
prosy
descriptions
of
it
was
an
actual
world
to
which
he
was
linked
in
which
he
had
possessions
of
which
he
was
a
native
and
for
the
perpetuation
and
enlargement
of
whose
splendor
all
worlds
existed
arrived
at
the
boundary
of
the
field
the
spot
marked
by
the
broken
pillar
of
red
granite
heliobas
had
mentioned
he
paused
thinking
dreamily
of
the
words
of
esdras
who
in
answer
to
his
inquiry
why
art
thou
disquieted
had
replied
because
thou
hast
forsaken
me
and
yet
i
did
according
to
thy
words
and
i
went
into
the
field
and
lo
i
have
seen
and
yet
see
that
i
am
not
able
to
express
whereupon
the
angel
had
said
stand
up
manfully
and
i
will
advise
thee
stand
up
manfully
yes
this
is
what
he
theos
alwyn
meant
to
do
he
would
stand
up
manfully
against
the
howling
iconoclasm
and
atheism
of
the
age
he
would
be
poet
henceforth
in
the
true
meaning
of
the
word
namely
maker
he
would
make
not
break
the
grand
ideal
hopes
and
ambitions
of
humanity
he
would
endeavor
his
utmost
best
to
be
that
hierarch
and
pontiff
of
the
world
as
a
modern
rugged
apostle
of
truth
has
nobly
said
who
can
shape
new
symbols
and
bring
new
fire
from
heaven
to
fix
them
into
the
deep
infinite
faculties
of
man
with
a
brief
silent
prayer
he
turned
away
at
last
and
walked
slowly
in
the
lovely
silence
of
the
early
eastern
morning
back
to
the
place
from
whence
he
had
last
night
wandered
the
hermitage
of
elzear
near
the
ruins
of
babylon
he
soon
came
in
sight
of
it
and
also
perceived
elzear
himself
stooping
over
a
small
plot
of
ground
in
front
of
his
dwelling
apparently
gathering
herbs
when
he
approached
the
old
man
looked
up
and
smiled
giving
him
a
silent
expressively
courteous
morning
greeting
by
his
manner
it
was
evident
that
he
thought
his
guest
had
merely
been
out
for
an
early
stroll
ere
the
heat
of
the
day
set
in
and
yet
how
real
had
seemed
that
in
that
the
figure
of
elzear
looked
scarcely
more
substantial
than
the
of
zephoranim
khosrul
zuriel
or
zabastes
while
lysia
exquisite
face
and
seductive
form
niphrata
pensive
beauty
and
all
the
local
characteristics
of
the
place
were
stamped
on
the
dreamer
memory
as
faithfully
as
scenes
flashed
by
the
sun
on
the
plates
of
photography
true
the
pictures
were
perhaps
now
slightly
fading
into
the
similitude
of
pale
negatives
but
still
would
not
everything
that
happened
in
the
actual
world
merge
into
that
same
undecided
dimness
with
the
lapse
of
time
he
thought
so
and
smiled
at
the
thought
the
transitory
nature
of
earthly
things
was
a
subject
for
joy
to
him
now
not
regret
with
a
kindly
word
or
two
to
his
venerable
host
he
went
through
the
open
door
of
the
hermitage
and
entered
the
little
room
he
had
left
only
a
few
hours
previously
it
appeared
to
him
as
familiar
and
unfamiliar
as
itself
till
raising
his
eyes
he
saw
the
great
crucifix
against
the
wall
the
sacred
symbol
whose
meaning
he
had
forgotten
and
hopelessly
longed
for
in
his
dream
and
from
which
before
his
visit
to
the
field
of
ardath
he
had
turned
with
a
sense
of
bitter
scorn
and
proud
rejection
but
now
now
he
gazed
upon
it
in
unspeakable
remorse
in
tenderest
desire
to
atone
the
sweet
grave
patient
eyes
of
the
holy
figure
seemed
to
meet
his
with
a
wondrous
challenge
of
love
longing
and
most
fraternal
sympathetic
comprehension
of
his
nature
he
paused
looking
and
the
false
words
of
george
herbert
suddenly
occurred
to
him
thy
saviour
sentenced
joy
o
blasphemy
sentenced
joy
nay
rather
it
and
invested
it
with
divine
certainties
beyond
all
temporal
change
or
evanishment
yielding
to
a
swift
impulse
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
with
clasped
hands
leaned
his
brows
against
the
feet
of
the
sculptured
christ
there
he
rested
in
wordless
peace
his
whole
soul
entranced
in
a
divine
passion
of
faith
hope
and
love
there
with
the
ardath
flower
in
his
breast
he
consecrated
his
life
to
the
highest
good
and
there
in
absolute
humility
and
pure
devotion

fresh
laurels
it
was
a
dismal
march
evening
london
lay
swathed
in
a
melancholy
fog
a
fog
too
dense
to
be
more
than
temporarily
disturbed
even
by
the
sudden
gusts
of
the
bitter
east
wind
rain
fell
steadily
sometimes
changing
to
sleet
that
drove
in
sharp
showers
on
the
slippery
roads
and
pavements
bewildering
the
tired
horses
and
stirring
up
much
irritation
in
the
minds
of
those
whom
business
certainly
not
pleasure
forced
to
encounter
the
inconveniences
of
the
weather
against
one
house
in
particular
an
irregular
building
situated
in
a
somewhat
but
picturesque
part
of
kensington
the
cold
wet
blast
blew
with
specially
keen
ferocity
as
though
it
were
angered
by
the
sounds
within
sounds
that
in
truth
rather
resembled
its
own
cross
groaning
curious
short
grunts
and
plaintive
cries
interspersed
with
an
occasional
pathetic
whine
suggested
dimly
the
idea
that
somebody
was
playing
or
trying
to
play
on
a
refractory
stringed
instrument
the
composition
known
as
raff
cavatina
and
in
fact
had
the
vexed
wind
been
able
to
break
through
the
wall
and
embody
itself
into
a
substantial
being
it
would
have
discovered
the
producer
of
the
noise
in
the
person
of
the
honorable
frank
villiers
who
with
that
amazingly
serious
ardor
so
often
displayed
by
amateur
lovers
of
music
was
persistently
endeavoring
to
combat
the
difficulties
of
the
violoncello
he
adored
his
big
instrument
the
more
unmanageable
it
became
in
his
hands
the
more
he
loved
it
its
grumbling
complaints
at
his
unskilful
touch
delighted
him
when
he
could
succeed
in
awakening
a
peevish
dull
sob
from
its
troubled
depths
he
felt
a
positive
thrill
of
almost
professional
triumph
and
he
refused
to
be
daunted
in
his
efforts
by
the
frequently
barbaric
clamor
his
awkward
bowing
wrung
from
the
tortured
strings
he
tried
every
sort
of
music
easy
and
intricate
and
his
happiest
hours
were
those
when
with
glass
in
eye
and
brow
knitted
in
anxious
scrutiny
he
could
peer
his
way
through
the
labyrinth
of
a
sonata
or
fantasia
much
too
complex
for
any
one
but
a
trained
artist
enjoying
to
the
full
the
mental
excitement
of
the
discordant
struggle
and
comfortably
conscious
that
as
his
residence
was
detached
no
obtrusive
neighbor
could
either
warn
him
to
desist
or
set
up
an
opposition
nuisance
next
door
by
constant
practice
on
the
distressingly
piano
one
thing
very
much
in
his
favor
was
that
he
never
manifested
any
desire
to
perform
in
public
no
one
had
ever
heard
him
play
he
pursued
his
favorite
amusement
in
solitude
and
was
amply
satisfied
if
when
questioned
on
the
subject
of
music
he
could
find
an
opportunity
to
say
with
a
air
my
instrument
is
the
that
was
quite
enough
for
him
and
if
any
one
ever
urged
him
to
display
his
talent
he
would
elude
the
request
with
such
charming
grace
and
diffidence
that
many
people
imagined
he
must
really
be
a
great
musical
genius
who
only
lacked
the
necessary
insolence
and
aplomb
to
make
that
genius
known
the
apart
villiers
was
very
generally
recognized
as
a
discerning
dilettante
in
most
matters
artistic
he
was
an
excellent
judge
of
literature
painting
and
sculpture
his
house
though
small
was
a
perfect
model
of
taste
in
design
and
adornment
he
knew
where
to
pick
up
choice
bits
of
antique
furniture
dainty
porcelain
bronzes
and
while
in
the
acquisition
of
rare
books
he
was
justly
considered
a
notable
connoisseur
his
delicate
and
fastidious
instincts
were
displayed
in
the
very
arrangement
of
his
numerous
volumes
none
were
placed
on
such
high
shelves
as
to
be
out
of
hand
reach
all
were
within
close
touch
and
ready
to
command
ranged
in
low
carved
oak
cases
or
on
revolving
stands
while
a
few
particularly
rare
editions
and
first
folios
were
shut
in
curious
little
side
niches
with
locked
somewhat
resembling
small
shrines
such
as
are
used
for
the
reception
of
sacred
relics
the
apartment
he
called
his
den
where
he
now
sat
practising
the
cavatina
for
about
the
time
was
perhaps
the
most
fascinating
nook
in
the
whole
house
inasmuch
as
it
contained
a
little
bit
of
everything
arranged
with
that
perfect
attention
to
detail
which
makes
each
object
small
and
great
appear
not
only
ornamental
but
positively
necessary
in
one
corner
a
quaint
old
jar
overflowed
with
the
brightness
of
fresh
yellow
daffodils
in
another
a
long
tapering
venetian
vase
held
feathery
clusters
of
african
grass
and
fern
here
the
medallion
of
a
greek
philosopher
or
roman
emperor
gleamed
whitely
against
the
sombrely
painted
wall
there
a
rembrandt
portrait
flashed
out
from
the
background
of
some
rich
carefully
disposed
fold
of
drapery
while
a
few
admirable
casts
from
the
antique
lit
up
the
deeper
shadows
of
the
room
such
as
the
immortally
youthful
head
of
the
apollo
belvedere
the
wisely
serene
countenance
of
the
pallas
athene
that
goethe
loved
and
the
cupid
of
praxiteles
judging
from
his
outward
appearance
only
few
would
have
given
villiers
credit
for
being
the
man
of
penetrative
and
almost
classic
refinement
he
really
was
he
looked
far
more
athletic
than
aesthetic
and
with
a
round
blunt
head
firmly
set
on
a
full
strong
throat
he
had
on
the
whole
a
somewhat
obstinate
and
pugilistic
air
which
totally
belied
his
nature
his
features
open
and
ruddy
were
without
being
handsome
decidedly
attractive
the
mouth
was
rather
large
yet
the
eyes
bright
blue
and
sparklingly
suggestive
of
a
native
inborn
love
of
humor
there
was
something
fresh
and
piquant
in
the
very
expression
of
naive
bewilderment
with
which
he
now
adjusted
his
eyeglass
a
wholly
unnecessary
appendage
and
set
himself
strenuously
to
examine
anew
the
chords
of
that
extraordinary
piece
of
music
which
others
thought
so
easy
and
which
he
found
so
puzzling
he
could
manage
the
simple
melody
fairly
well
but
the
chords
they
are
the
very
devil
he
murmured
plaintively
staring
at
the
score
and
hitching
up
his
unruly
instrument
more
securely
against
his
knee
perhaps
the
bow
wants
a
little
rosin
this
was
one
of
his
minor
weaknesses
he
would
never
quite
admit
that
false
notes
were
his
own
fault
they
could
be
you
know
he
mildly
argued
addressing
the
obtrusive
neck
of
the
which
had
a
curious
stubborn
way
of
poking
itself
into
his
chin
and
causing
him
to
wonder
how
it
got
there
surely
the
manner
in
which
he
held
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
awkward
occurrence
i
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
understand
how
to
find
the
right
notes
after
all
my
practice
there
something
wrong
with
the
strings
or
the
bridge
has
gone
awry
or
and
this
was
his
last
resource
the
bow
wants
more
rosin
thus
he
hugged
himself
in
deliciously
wilful
ignorance
of
his
own
shortcomings
and
shut
his
ears
to
the
whispered
reproaches
of
musical
conscience
had
he
been
married
his
wife
would
no
doubt
have
lost
no
time
in
enlightening
him
she
would
have
told
him
he
was
a
wretched
player
that
his
scrapings
on
the
were
enough
to
drive
one
mad
and
sundry
other
assurances
of
the
perfectly
conjugal
type
of
frankness
but
as
it
chanced
he
was
a
happy
bachelor
a
free
and
independent
man
with
more
than
sufficient
means
to
gratify
his
particular
tastes
and
whims
he
was
partner
in
a
steadily
prosperous
banking
concern
and
had
just
enough
to
do
to
keep
him
pleasantly
and
profitably
occupied
asked
why
he
did
not
marry
he
replied
with
blunt
and
almost
brutal
honesty
that
he
had
never
yet
met
a
woman
whose
conversation
he
could
stand
for
more
than
an
hour
silly
or
clever
he
said
they
are
all
possessed
of
the
same
infinite
tedium
either
they
say
nothing
or
they
say
everything
they
are
always
at
the
two
extremes
and
announce
themselves
as
dunces
or
one
wants
the
just
medium
the
dainty
commingling
of
simplicity
and
wisdom
that
shall
yet
be
pure
womanly
and
this
is
precisely
the
jewel
above
rubies
that
one
can
not
find
i
given
up
the
search
long
ago
and
am
entirely
resigned
to
my
lot
i
like
women
very
well
i
may
say
very
much
as
friends
but
to
take
one
on
chance
as
a
comrade
for
life
no
thank
you
such
was
his
fixed
opinion
and
consequent
rejection
of
matrimony
and
for
the
rest
he
studied
art
and
literature
and
became
an
authority
on
both
so
much
so
that
on
one
occasion
he
kept
a
goodly
number
of
people
away
from
visiting
the
royal
academy
exhibition
he
having
voted
it
a
disgrace
to
art
english
artists
occupy
the
last
grade
in
the
whole
school
of
painting
he
had
said
indignantly
with
that
decisive
manner
of
his
which
somehow
or
other
carried
conviction
the
very
dutch
surpass
them
and
instead
of
trying
to
raise
their
standard
each
year
sees
them
grovelling
in
lower
depths
the
academy
is
becoming
a
mere
gallery
of
portraits
painted
to
please
the
caprices
of
vain
men
and
women
at
a
thousand
or
two
thousand
guineas
apiece
ugly
portraits
too
woodeny
portraits
utterly
uninteresting
portraits
of
prosaic
nobodies
who
cares
to
see
flummery
in
her
except
flummery
own
particular
friends
or
miss
smox
eldest
daughter
of
professor
smox
or
baines
bryce
who
is
baines
bryce
nobody
ever
heard
of
him
before
he
may
be
a
retired
for
all
any
one
knows
portraits
even
of
celebrities
are
a
mistake
take
algernon
charles
swinburne
for
instance
the
man
who
when
left
to
himself
writes
some
of
the
grandest
lines
in
the
english
language
he
had
his
portrait
in
the
academy
and
everybody
ran
away
from
it
it
was
such
an
unutterable
hideous
disappointment
it
was
a
positive
libel
of
course
swinburne
has
fine
eyes
and
a
still
finer
brow
but
instead
of
idealizing
the
poet
in
him
the
silly
artist
painted
him
as
if
he
had
no
more
intellectual
distinction
than
a
english
art
pooh
do
speak
to
me
about
it
go
to
spain
italy
bavaria
see
what
they
can
do
and
then
say
a
miserere
for
the
sins
of
the
r
a
thus
he
would
talk
and
his
criticisms
carried
weight
with
a
tolerably
large
circle
of
influential
and
wealthy
persons
who
when
they
called
upon
him
and
saw
the
perfection
of
his
house
and
the
rarity
of
his
art
collections
came
at
once
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
wise
as
well
as
advantageous
to
themselves
to
consult
him
before
purchasing
pictures
books
statues
or
china
so
that
he
occupied
the
powerful
position
of
being
able
with
a
word
to
start
an
artist
reputation
or
depreciate
it
as
he
chose
a
distinction
he
had
not
desired
and
which
was
often
a
source
of
trouble
to
him
because
there
were
so
few
so
very
few
whose
work
he
felt
he
could
conscientiously
approve
and
encourage
he
was
eminently
and
sympathetic
he
would
not
give
pain
to
others
without
being
infinitely
more
pained
himself
and
yet
for
all
his
amiability
there
was
a
stubborn
instinct
in
him
which
forbade
him
to
promote
by
word
or
look
the
fatal
nineteenth
century
spread
of
mediocrity
either
a
thing
must
be
truly
great
and
capable
of
being
measured
by
the
highest
standards
or
for
him
it
had
no
value
this
rule
he
carried
out
in
all
branches
of
art
except
his
own
that
was
not
great
that
would
never
be
great
but
it
was
his
pet
pastime
he
chose
it
in
preference
to
the
billiards
betting
and
that
make
up
the
amusements
of
the
majority
of
the
hopeful
manhood
of
london
and
as
has
already
been
said
he
never
inflicted
it
upon
others
he
rubbed
the
rosin
now
thoughtfully
up
and
down
his
bow
and
glanced
at
the
quaint
old
clock
an
importation
from
nurnberg
that
ticked
solemnly
in
one
corner
near
the
deep
across
which
the
heavy
olive
green
plush
curtains
were
drawn
to
shut
out
the
penetrating
chill
of
the
wind
it
wanted
ten
minutes
to
nine
he
had
given
orders
to
his
man
servant
that
he
was
on
no
account
to
be
disturbed
that
evening
no
matter
what
visitors
called
for
him
none
were
to
be
admitted
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
have
a
long
and
energetic
practice
and
he
felt
a
secret
satisfaction
as
he
heard
the
steady
patter
of
the
rain
outside
the
very
weather
favored
his
desire
for
solitude
no
one
was
likely
to
venture
forth
on
such
a
night
still
gravely
rubbing
his
brow
his
eyes
travelled
from
the
clock
in
the
corner
to
a
photograph
on
the
the
photograph
of
a
man
face
dark
haughty
beautiful
yet
repellent
in
its
beauty
and
with
a
certain
hard
sternness
in
its
outline
the
face
of
theos
alwyn
from
this
portrait
his
glance
wandered
to
the
table
where
amid
a
picturesque
litter
of
books
and
papers
lay
a
square
simply
bound
volume
with
an
ivory
thrust
in
it
to
mark
the
place
where
the
reader
left
off
and
its
title
plainly
lettered
in
gold
at
the
back
nourhalma
i
wonder
where
he
is
he
mused
his
thoughts
naturally
reverting
to
the
author
of
the
he
can
not
know
what
all
london
knows
or
surely
he
would
be
back
here
like
a
shot
it
is
six
months
ago
now
since
i
received
his
letter
and
that
poem
in
manuscript
from
tiflis
in
armenia
and
not
another
line
has
he
sent
to
tell
me
of
his
whereabouts
curious
fellow
he
is
but
by
jove
what
a
genius
no
wonder
he
has
besieged
fame
and
taken
it
by
storm
i
do
remember
any
similar
instance
except
that
of
byron
in
which
such
an
unprecedented
reputation
was
made
so
suddenly
and
in
byron
case
it
was
more
the
domestic
scandal
about
him
than
his
actual
merit
that
made
him
the
rage
now
the
world
knows
literally
nothing
about
alwyn
private
life
or
character
there
no
woman
in
his
history
that
i
know
of
no
vice
he
has
outraged
the
law
upset
morals
flouted
at
decency
or
done
anything
that
according
to
modern
fashions
ought
to
have
made
him
famous
no
he
has
simply
produced
a
perfect
poem
stately
grand
pure
and
pathetic
and
all
of
a
sudden
some
secret
spring
in
the
human
heart
is
touched
some
valve
opened
and
lo
and
behold
all
intellectual
society
is
raving
about
him
his
name
is
in
everybody
mouth
his
book
in
every
one
hands
i
do
altogether
like
his
being
made
the
subject
of
a
experience
shows
me
a
kind
of
thing
that
does
last
in
fact
it
ca
the
reaction
invariably
sets
in
and
the
english
public
is
of
all
publics
the
most
insane
in
its
periodical
frenzies
and
the
most
capricious
now
it
is
all
agog
for
a
sensational
then
it
discusses
itself
hoarse
over
a
theological
novel
made
up
out
of
theories
long
ago
propounded
and
exhaustively
set
forth
by
voltaire
and
others
of
his
school
anon
it
revels
in
the
gross
descriptions
of
shameless
vice
depicted
in
an
translated
romance
of
the
paris
slums
now
it
writes
thousands
of
letters
to
a
black
man
to
sympathize
with
him
because
he
has
been
called
black
could
anything
be
more
absurd
it
has
even
followed
the
departure
of
an
elephant
from
the
zoo
in
weeping
crowds
however
i
wish
all
the
crazes
to
which
it
is
subject
were
as
harmless
and
wholesome
as
the
one
that
has
seized
it
for
alwyn
book
for
if
true
poetry
were
brought
to
the
front
instead
of
being
as
it
often
is
sneered
at
and
kept
in
the
background
we
should
have
a
chance
of
regaining
the
lost
divine
art
that
wherever
it
has
been
worthily
followed
has
proved
the
glory
of
the
greatest
nations
and
then
we
should
not
have
to
put
up
with
such
detestable
inanities
as
are
produced
every
day
by
persons
calling
themselves
poets
who
are
scarcely
fit
to
write
mottoes
for
dessert
crackers
and
we
might
escape
for
good
and
all
from
the
infliction
of
which
is
emphatically
a
positive
affront
to
the
human
intelligence
ah
me
what
wretched
upholders
we
are
of
shakespeare
standard
keats
was
our
last
splendor
then
there
is
an
unfilled
gap
bridged
in
part
by
tennyson
and
now
comes
alwyn
blazing
abroad
like
a
veritable
meteor
only
i
believe
he
will
do
more
than
merely
flare
across
the
heavens
he
promises
to
become
a
notable
fixed
star
here
he
smiled
somewhat
pleased
with
his
own
skill
in
metaphor
and
having
rubbed
his
bow
enough
he
drew
it
lingeringly
across
the
strings
a
long
sweet
shuddering
sound
rewarded
him
like
the
upward
wave
of
a
wind
among
high
trees
and
he
heard
it
with
much
gratification
he
would
try
the
cavatina
again
now
he
decided
and
bringing
his
closer
he
settled
himself
in
readiness
to
begin
just
then
the
nurnberg
clock
commenced
striking
the
hour
accompanying
each
stroke
with
a
very
soft
and
mellow
little
chime
of
bells
that
sent
echoes
through
the
quiet
room
a
bright
flame
started
up
from
the
glowing
fire
in
the
grate
flinging
ruddy
flashes
along
the
walls
a
rattling
gust
of
rain
dashed
once
at
the
windows
the
tuneful
clock
ceased
and
all
was
still
villiers
waited
a
moment
then
with
heedful
earnestness
started
the
first
bar
of
raff
composition
when
a
knock
at
the
door
disturbed
him
and
considerably
ruffled
his
equanimity
come
in
he
called
testily
his
appeared
a
look
on
his
staid
countenance
please
sir
a
gentleman
called
well
you
said
i
was
out
no
sir
leastways
i
thought
you
might
be
at
home
to
him
sir
confound
you
exclaimed
villiers
petulantly
throwing
down
his
bow
in
disgust
what
business
had
you
to
think
anything
about
it
i
tell
you
i
was
at
home
to
anybody
come
come
villiers
said
a
mellow
voice
outside
with
a
ripple
of
suppressed
laughter
in
its
tone
do
be
inhospitable
i
sure
you
are
at
home
to
me
and
passing
by
the
servant
who
at
once
retired
the
speaker
entered
the
apartment
lifted
his
hat
and
smiled
villiers
sprang
from
his
chair
in
delighted
astonishment
alwyn
he
cried
and
the
two
friends
whose
friendship
dated
from
boyhood
clasped
each
other
hands
heartily
and
were
for
a
moment
both
silent
of
those
affectionate
emotions
to
which
impulsive
women
may
freely
give
vent
but
to
which
men
may
not
yield
without
being
supposed
to
lose
somewhat
of
the
dignity
of
manhood
by
jove
said
villiers
at
last
drawing
a
deep
breath
this
is
a
surprise
only
a
few
minutes
ago
i
was
considering
whether
we
should
not
have
to
note
you
down
in
the
newspaper
as
one
of
the
disappearances
grown
common
of
late
where
do
you
come
from
old
fellow
from
paris
just
directly
responded
alwyn
divesting
himself
of
his
overcoat
and
stepping
outside
the
door
to
hang
it
on
an
evidently
familiar
nail
in
the
passage
and
then
but
from
bagdad
in
the
first
instance
i
visited
that
city
sacred
to
and
from
thence
journeyed
to
damascus
like
one
of
our
favorite
merchants
in
the
arabian
nights
then
i
went
to
beyrout
and
alexandria
from
which
latter
place
i
took
ship
homeward
stopping
at
delicious
venice
while
on
my
way
then
you
did
the
holy
land
i
suppose
queried
villiers
regarding
him
with
sudden
and
growing
inquisitiveness
my
dear
fellow
certainly
not
the
holy
land
invested
by
touts
and
overrun
by
tourists
would
neither
appeal
to
my
imagination
nor
my
sentiments
and
in
its
present
state
of
vulgar
abuse
and
unchristian
sacrilege
it
is
better
left
unseen
by
those
who
wish
to
revere
its
associations
do
you
think
so
he
smiled
as
he
put
the
question
and
drawing
up
an
oak
chair
to
the
fire
seated
himself
villiers
meanwhile
stared
at
him
in
unmitigated
amazement
what
had
come
to
the
fellow
he
wondered
how
had
he
managed
to
invest
himself
with
such
an
overpowering
distinction
of
look
and
grace
of
bearing
he
had
always
been
a
handsome
man
yes
but
there
was
certainly
something
more
than
handsome
about
him
now
there
was
a
singular
magnetism
in
the
flash
of
the
fine
soft
eyes
a
marvellous
sweetness
in
the
firm
lines
of
the
perfect
mouth
a
royal
grandeur
and
freedom
in
the
very
poise
of
his
figure
and
noble
head
that
certainly
had
not
before
been
apparent
in
him
moreover
that
was
an
odd
remark
for
him
to
make
about
wishing
to
revere
the
associations
of
the
holy
land
very
odd
considering
his
formerly
skeptical
theories
rousing
himself
from
his
momentary
bewilderment
villiers
remembered
the
duties
of
hospitality
have
you
dined
alwyn
he
asked
with
his
hand
on
the
bell
excellently
was
the
response
accompanied
by
a
bright
upward
glance
i
went
to
that
big
hotel
opposite
the
park
had
dinner
left
the
surplus
of
my
luggage
in
charge
selected
one
small
portmanteau
took
a
hansom
and
came
on
here
resolved
to
pass
one
night
at
least
under
your
roof
one
night
interrupted
villiers
you
very
much
mistaken
if
you
think
you
are
going
to
get
off
so
easily
you
not
escape
from
me
for
a
month
i
tell
you
consider
yourself
a
prisoner
good
send
for
the
luggage
laughed
alwyn
flinging
himself
back
in
his
chair
in
an
attitude
of
lazy
comfort
i
give
in
i
resign
myself
to
my
fate
but
what
of
the
and
he
pointed
to
the
casket
of
sweet
sleeping
sounds
sleeping
generally
so
far
as
villiers
was
concerned
but
ready
to
wake
at
the
first
touch
of
the
villiers
glanced
at
it
with
a
comical
air
of
admiring
vanquishment
oh
never
mind
the
he
said
indifferently
that
can
bear
being
put
by
for
a
while
it
a
most
curious
instrument
sometimes
it
seems
to
sound
better
when
i
have
let
it
rest
a
little
just
like
a
human
thing
you
know
it
gets
occasionally
tired
of
me
i
suppose
but
i
say
why
did
you
come
straight
here
bag
baggage
and
all
what
business
had
you
to
stop
on
the
way
at
any
hotel
do
you
call
that
friendship
alwyn
laughed
at
his
mock
injured
tone
i
apologize
villiers
i
really
do
but
i
felt
it
would
be
scarcely
civil
of
me
to
come
down
upon
you
for
bed
board
and
lodging
without
giving
you
previous
notice
and
at
the
same
time
i
wanted
to
take
you
by
surprise
as
i
did
besides
i
was
sure
whether
i
should
find
you
in
town
of
course
i
knew
i
should
be
welcome
if
you
were
rather
assented
villiers
shortly
and
with
affected
if
you
were
sure
of
nothing
else
in
this
world
you
might
be
sure
of
that
he
paused
squared
his
shoulders
and
put
up
his
eyeglass
through
which
he
scanned
his
friend
with
such
a
persistently
scrutinizing
air
that
alwyn
was
somewhat
amused
what
are
you
staring
at
me
for
he
demanded
gayly
am
i
so
bronzed
well
you
are
rather
brown
admitted
villiers
slowly
but
that
does
surprise
me
the
fact
is
it
very
odd
and
i
ca
altogether
explain
it
but
somehow
i
find
you
changed
positively
very
much
changed
too
changed
in
appearance
do
you
mean
how
here
upon
this
picture
and
on
this
quoted
villiers
dramatically
taking
down
alwyn
portrait
from
the
mantleshelf
and
mentally
comparing
it
with
the
smiling
original
no
two
heads
were
ever
more
alike
and
yet
more
distinctly
unlike
here
and
he
tapped
the
photograph
you
have
the
appearance
of
a
modern
timon
or
but
now
as
you
actually
are
i
see
more
resemblance
in
your
face
to
that
and
he
pointed
to
the
serene
and
splendid
bust
of
the
apollo
than
to
this
presentment
of
your
former
self
alwyn
flushed
not
so
much
at
the
implied
compliment
as
at
the
words
former
self
but
quickly
shaking
off
his
embarrassment
he
glanced
round
at
the
apollo
and
lifted
his
eyebrows
incredulously
then
all
i
can
say
my
dear
boy
is
that
that
eyeglass
of
yours
represents
objects
to
your
own
view
in
a
classic
light
which
is
entirely
deceptive
for
i
fail
to
trace
the
faintest
similitude
between
my
own
features
and
that
of
the
sunborn
lord
of
laurels
oh
you
may
not
trace
it
said
villiers
calmly
but
nevertheless
others
will
some
people
say
that
no
man
knows
what
he
really
is
like
and
that
even
his
own
reflection
in
the
glass
deceives
him
besides
it
is
not
so
much
the
actual
contour
for
the
features
that
impresses
one
it
is
the
look
you
have
the
look
of
the
greek
god
the
look
of
conscious
power
and
inward
happiness
he
spoke
seriously
thoughtfully
surveying
his
friend
with
a
vague
feeling
of
admiration
akin
to
reverence
alwyn
stooped
and
stirred
the
fire
into
a
brighter
blaze
well
so
far
my
looks
do
not
belie
me
he
said
gently
after
a
i
am
conscious
of
both
power
and
joy
why
naturally
and
villiers
laid
one
hand
affectionately
on
his
of
course
the
face
of
the
whole
world
has
changed
for
you
now
that
you
have
won
such
tremendous
fame
fame
alwyn
sprang
upright
so
suddenly
that
villiers
was
quite
startled
fame
who
says
i
am
famous
and
his
eyes
flashed
forth
an
amazed
almost
haughty
resentment
his
friend
stared
then
laughed
outright
who
says
it
why
all
london
says
it
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
alwyn
that
you
not
seen
the
english
papers
and
magazines
containing
all
the
critical
reviews
and
discussions
on
your
poem
of
alwyn
winced
at
the
title
what
a
host
of
strange
memories
it
recalled
i
have
seen
nothing
he
replied
hurriedly
i
have
made
it
a
point
to
look
at
no
papers
lest
i
should
chance
on
my
own
name
coupled
as
it
has
been
before
with
the
languid
abuse
common
to
criticism
in
this
country
not
that
i
should
have
cared
now
and
a
slight
smile
played
on
his
in
fact
i
have
ceased
to
care
moreover
as
i
know
modern
success
in
literature
is
chiefly
commanded
by
the
praise
of
a
or
the
services
of
and
as
i
am
not
included
in
any
of
the
journalistic
rings
i
have
neither
hoped
nor
expected
any
particular
favor
or
recognition
from
the
public
then
said
villiers
excitedly
seizing
him
by
the
hand
let
me
be
the
first
to
congratulate
you
it
is
often
the
way
that
when
we
no
longer
specially
crave
a
thing
that
thing
is
suddenly
thrust
upon
us
whether
we
will
or
no
and
so
it
has
happened
in
your
case
learn
therefore
my
dear
fellow
that
your
poem
which
you
sent
to
me
from
tiflis
and
which
was
published
under
my
supervision
about
four
months
ago
has
already
run
through
six
editions
and
is
now
in
its
seventh
seven
editions
of
a
poem
poem
mark
you
in
four
months
bad
moreover
the
demand
continues
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
your
name
is
actually
at
the
present
moment
the
most
celebrated
in
all
london
in
fact
you
are
very
generally
acknowledged
the
greatest
poet
of
the
day
and
continued
villiers
wringing
his
friend
hand
with
uncommon
i
say
god
bless
you
old
boy
if
ever
a
man
deserved
success
you
do
is
magnificent
such
a
genius
as
yours
will
raise
the
literature
of
the
age
to
a
higher
standard
than
it
has
known
since
the
death
of
adonais
footnote
keats
you
ca
imagine
how
sincerely
i
rejoice
at
your
triumph
alwyn
was
silent
he
returned
his
companion
cordial
almost
unconsciously
he
stood
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
and
looking
gravely
down
into
the
fire
his
first
emotion
was
one
of
repugnance
of
rejection
what
did
he
need
of
this
called
fame
dancing
again
across
his
path
this
transitory
torch
of
fame
in
london
what
was
it
what
could
it
be
compared
to
the
brilliancy
of
the
fame
he
had
once
enjoyed
as
laureate
of
as
this
thought
passed
across
his
mind
he
gave
a
quick
interrogative
glance
at
villiers
who
was
observing
him
with
much
wondering
intentness
and
his
handsome
face
lighted
with
sudden
laughter
dear
old
boy
he
said
with
a
very
tender
inflection
in
his
mellow
mirthful
voice
you
are
the
best
of
good
fellows
and
i
thank
you
heartily
for
your
news
which
if
it
seems
satisfactory
to
you
ought
certainly
to
be
satisfactory
to
me
but
tell
me
frankly
if
i
am
as
famous
as
you
say
how
did
i
become
so
how
was
it
worked
up
worked
up
villiers
was
completely
taken
back
by
the
oddity
of
this
question
come
continued
alwyn
persuasively
his
fine
eyes
sparkling
with
mischievous
you
ca
make
me
believe
that
took
to
me
suddenly
of
its
own
accord
it
is
not
so
romantic
so
so
independent
or
so
generous
as
that
how
was
my
first
started
if
my
book
which
has
all
the
disadvantage
of
being
a
poem
instead
of
a
novel
has
so
suddenly
leaped
into
high
favor
and
renown
why
then
some
leading
critic
or
other
must
have
thought
that
i
myself
was
dead
the
whimsical
merriment
of
his
face
seemed
to
reflect
itself
on
that
of
villiers
you
too
alwyn
positively
you
are
he
remonstrated
with
a
frankly
humorous
but
as
it
happens
you
perfectly
right
not
one
critic
but
three
three
of
our
most
influential
men
too
thought
you
were
dead
and
that
was
a
posthumous
work
of
perished
genius
chapter
xxxii
zabastesism
and
paulism
the
delighted
air
of
triumphant
conviction
with
which
alwyn
received
this
candid
statement
was
irresistible
and
villiers
attempt
at
equanimity
entirely
gave
way
before
it
he
broke
into
a
roar
of
laughter
laughter
in
which
his
friend
joined
and
for
a
minute
or
two
the
room
rang
with
the
echoes
of
their
mutual
mirth
it
was
my
doing
said
villiers
at
last
when
he
could
control
himself
a
little
and
even
now
i
do
in
the
least
know
how
the
misconception
arose
was
published
according
to
your
instructions
as
rapidly
as
it
could
be
got
through
the
press
and
i
had
no
preliminary
or
announcements
of
any
kind
circulated
in
the
papers
i
merely
advertised
it
with
a
notable
simplicity
thus
a
of
the
past
a
poem
by
theos
alwyn
that
was
all
well
when
it
came
out
copies
of
it
were
sent
according
to
custom
round
to
all
the
leading
newspaper
offices
and
for
about
three
weeks
after
its
publication
i
saw
not
a
word
concerning
it
anywhere
meanwhile
i
went
on
advertising
one
day
at
the
constitutional
club
while
glancing
over
the
parthenon
i
suddenly
spied
in
it
a
long
review
occupying
four
columns
and
headed
and
just
out
of
curiosity
i
began
to
read
it
i
remember
in
fact
i
shall
never
forget
its
opening
sentence
it
was
so
original
and
he
laughed
again
it
commenced
thus
has
been
truly
said
that
those
whom
the
gods
love
die
young
and
then
on
it
went
dragging
in
memories
of
chatterton
and
shelley
and
keats
till
i
found
myself
yawning
and
wondering
what
the
deuce
the
writer
was
driving
at
presently
about
the
end
of
the
second
column
i
came
to
the
assertion
that
posthumous
poem
of
nourhalma
must
be
admitted
as
one
of
the
most
glorious
productions
in
the
english
language
this
woke
me
up
considerably
and
i
read
on
groping
my
way
through
all
sorts
of
wordy
phrases
and
arguments
till
my
mind
gradually
grasped
the
fact
that
the
critic
of
the
parthenon
had
evidently
never
heard
of
theos
alwyn
before
and
being
astonished
and
perhaps
perplexed
by
the
original
beauty
and
glowing
style
of
had
jumped
without
warrant
to
the
conclusion
that
its
author
must
be
dead
the
of
his
lengthy
dissertation
was
as
far
as
i
can
recollect
as
follows
is
a
thousand
pities
this
gifted
poet
is
no
more
splendid
as
the
work
of
his
youthful
genius
is
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
had
he
lived
he
would
have
endowed
the
world
anew
with
an
inheritance
of
thought
worthy
of
the
grandest
well
when
i
had
fully
realized
the
situation
i
began
to
think
to
myself
shall
i
enlighten
this
sir
oracle
of
the
press
and
tell
him
the
author
he
so
enthusiastically
eulogizes
is
alive
and
well
or
was
so
at
any
rate
the
last
time
i
heard
from
him
i
debated
the
question
seriously
and
after
much
cogitation
decided
to
leave
him
for
the
present
in
ignorance
first
of
all
because
critics
like
to
consider
themselves
the
wisest
men
in
the
world
and
hate
to
be
told
anything
secondly
because
i
rather
enjoyed
the
fun
the
publisher
of
a
very
excellent
fellow
sent
me
the
critique
and
wrote
asking
me
whether
it
was
true
that
the
author
of
the
poem
was
really
dead
and
if
not
whether
he
should
contradict
the
report
i
waited
a
bit
before
answering
that
letter
and
while
i
waited
two
more
critiques
appeared
in
two
of
the
most
assertively
pompous
and
dictatorial
journals
of
the
day
echoing
the
eulogies
of
the
parthenon
declaring
dead
worthy
rank
with
the
highest
of
the
immortals
and
a
number
of
other
similar
grandiose
declarations
one
reviewer
took
an
infinite
deal
of
pains
to
prove
if
the
genius
of
theos
alwyn
had
only
been
spared
to
england
he
must
have
infallibly
been
elected
poet
laureate
as
soon
as
the
post
became
vacant
and
that
too
without
a
single
dissentient
voice
save
such
as
were
raised
in
envy
or
malice
but
being
dead
continued
this
estimable
scribe
we
can
say
is
that
he
yet
speaketh
and
that
nourhalma
is
a
poem
of
which
the
literary
world
can
not
be
otherwise
than
justly
proud
let
the
tears
that
we
shed
for
this
gifted
singer
untimely
decease
be
mingled
with
gratitude
for
the
priceless
value
of
the
work
his
creative
genius
has
bequeathed
to
us
here
villiers
paused
his
blue
eyes
sparkling
with
inward
amusement
and
looked
at
alwyn
whose
face
though
perfectly
serene
had
now
the
faintest
softest
shadow
of
a
grave
pathos
hovering
about
it
by
this
time
he
i
thought
we
had
had
about
enough
sport
so
i
wrote
off
to
the
publisher
to
at
once
contradict
the
erroneous
rumor
but
now
that
publisher
had
his
story
to
tell
he
called
upon
me
and
with
a
blandly
persuasive
air
said
that
as
was
having
an
extraordinary
sale
was
it
worth
while
to
deny
the
statement
of
your
death
just
yet
he
was
very
anxious
but
i
was
firm
and
lest
he
should
waver
i
wrote
several
letters
myself
to
the
leading
journals
to
establish
the
certainty
so
far
as
i
was
aware
of
your
being
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
then
what
do
you
think
happened
alwyn
met
his
bright
satirical
glance
with
a
look
that
was
but
said
nothing
it
was
the
most
laughable
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
beautifully
instructive
lesson
ever
taught
by
the
whole
annals
of
journalism
the
press
turned
round
like
a
weathercock
with
the
wind
and
exhausted
every
epithet
of
abuse
they
could
find
in
the
dictionaries
was
a
work
outrage
to
intellectual
perception
good
idea
spoilt
in
the
treatment
an
amazingly
obscure
attempt
at
sublimity
et
cetera
but
there
you
can
yourself
peruse
all
the
criticisms
both
favorable
and
adverse
for
i
have
acted
the
part
of
the
fond
granny
to
you
in
the
careful
cutting
out
and
pasting
of
everything
i
could
find
written
concerning
you
and
your
work
in
a
book
devoted
to
the
purpose
and
i
believe
missed
nothing
mark
you
however
the
parthenon
never
reversed
its
judgment
nor
did
the
other
two
leading
journals
of
literary
opinion
it
would
do
for
such
bigwigs
to
confess
they
had
blundered
you
know
and
the
vituperation
of
the
smaller
fry
was
just
the
other
weight
in
the
balance
which
made
the
thing
equal
the
sale
of
grew
fast
and
furious
all
expenses
were
cleared
three
times
over
and
at
the
present
moment
the
publisher
is
getting
conscientiously
anxious
for
some
publishers
are
more
conscientious
than
some
authors
will
admit
to
hand
you
over
a
nice
little
check
for
an
amount
which
is
not
to
be
despised
in
this
workaday
world
i
assure
you
i
did
not
write
for
money
interrupted
alwyn
nor
shall
i
ever
do
so
of
course
not
assented
villiers
promptly
no
poet
and
indeed
no
author
whatsoever
who
lays
claim
to
a
fraction
of
conscience
writes
for
money
only
those
with
whom
money
is
the
first
consideration
debase
their
art
into
a
coarse
huckstering
trade
and
are
no
better
than
contentious
bakers
and
cheesemongers
who
jostle
each
other
in
a
vulgar
struggle
as
to
which
shall
sell
perishable
goods
at
the
highest
profit
none
of
the
lasting
works
of
the
world
were
written
so
nevertheless
if
the
public
voluntarily
choose
to
lavish
what
they
can
of
their
best
on
the
author
who
imparts
to
them
inspired
thoughts
and
noble
teachings
then
that
author
must
not
be
churlish
or
slow
to
accept
the
gratitude
implied
i
think
the
most
appropriate
maxim
for
a
poet
to
address
to
his
readers
is
ye
have
received
freely
give
there
was
a
moment
silence
alwyn
resumed
his
seat
in
the
chair
near
the
fire
and
villiers
leaning
one
arm
on
the
mantelpiece
still
stood
looking
down
upon
him
such
my
dear
fellow
he
went
on
is
the
history
of
the
success
of
it
certainly
began
with
the
belief
that
you
were
no
longer
able
to
benefit
by
the
eulogy
but
all
the
same
that
eulogy
has
been
uttered
and
can
not
be
unuttered
it
has
led
all
the
lovers
of
the
highest
literature
to
get
the
book
for
themselves
and
to
prove
your
actual
worth
independently
of
press
opinions
and
the
result
is
an
immense
and
steadily
widening
verdict
in
your
favor
speaking
personally
i
have
never
read
anything
that
gave
me
quite
so
much
artistic
pleasure
as
this
poem
of
yours
except
only
is
distinctly
classical
while
takes
us
back
into
some
hitherto
unexplored
world
of
antique
paganism
which
though
essentially
pagan
is
wonderfully
full
of
pure
and
lofty
sentiment
when
did
the
idea
first
strike
you
a
long
time
ago
returned
alwyn
with
a
slight
serious
smile
i
assure
you
it
is
by
no
means
original
villiers
gave
him
a
quick
surprised
glance
no
well
it
seems
to
me
singularly
original
he
in
fact
one
of
your
critics
says
you
are
too
original
mind
you
alwyn
that
is
a
very
serious
fault
in
this
imitative
age
alwyn
laughed
a
little
his
thoughts
were
very
busy
again
in
imagination
he
beheld
the
burning
temple
of
nagaya
in
his
dream
of
again
he
saw
himself
carrying
the
corpse
of
his
former
self
through
fire
and
flame
and
again
he
heard
the
last
words
of
the
dying
zabastes
i
was
the
poet
adverse
critic
and
who
but
i
should
write
his
eulogy
save
me
if
only
for
the
sake
of
future
honor
thou
knowest
not
how
warmly
how
generously
how
nobly
i
can
praise
the
dead
true
how
easy
to
praise
the
poor

either
with

or
make

the
splendors
of

fame
some
such
thoughts
as
these
passed
through
alwyn
mind
as
he
dreamily
gazed
into
the
red
hollows
of
the
fire
and
reconsidered
all
that
his
friend
had
told
him
he
had
no
personal
acquaintances
on
the
press
no
literary
club
or
clique
to
haul
him
up
into
the
mast
of
renown
by
persistent
puffery
he
was
not
related
even
distantly
to
any
great
personage
either
statesman
professor
or
divine
he
had
not
the
mysterious
recommendation
of
being
a
university
man
none
of
the
many
wheels
within
wheels
which
are
nowadays
so
frequently
set
in
motion
to
make
up
a
momentary
literary
furore
were
his
to
command
and
yet
the
parthenon
had
praised
him
wonder
of
wonders
the
parthenon
was
a
singularly
obtuse
journal
which
glanced
at
the
whole
world
of
letters
merely
through
the
eyes
of
three
or
four
men
of
distinctly
narrow
and
egotistical
opinions
and
these
three
or
four
men
kept
it
as
much
as
possible
to
themselves
using
its
columns
chiefly
for
the
purpose
of
admiring
one
another
as
a
consequence
of
this
restricted
arrangement
very
few
outsiders
could
expect
to
be
noticed
for
their
work
unless
they
were
in
the
set
or
at
least
had
occasionally
dined
with
one
of
the
mystic
three
or
four
and
so
it
had
chanced
that
alwyn
first
venture
into
literature
had
been
totally
disregarded
by
the
parthenon
in
fact
that
first
venture
being
a
small
and
unobtrusive
book
had
most
probably
been
thrown
into
the
basket
or
sold
for
a
few
pence
to
the
dealer
and
now
now
because
he
had
been
imagined
dead
the
leading
critic
had
singled
him
out
and
held
him
up
for
universal
admiration
well
well
after
all
nourhalma
was
a
posthumous
work
it
had
been
written
before
ages
since
when
he
as
had
perished
ere
he
had
had
time
to
give
it
to
the
world
he
had
merely
remembered
drawn
it
forth
again
as
it
were
from
the
dim
deep
vistas
of
past
deeds
so
those
who
had
reviewed
it
as
the
production
of
one
dead
in
youth
were
right
in
their
judgment
though
they
did
not
know
it
it
was
old
nothing
but
repetition
but
now
he
had
something
new
and
true
and
passionate
to
say
something
that
if
god
pleased
it
should
be
his
to
utter
with
the
clearness
and
forcibleness
common
to
the
greek
thunderers
of
yore
who
spoke
out
what
was
in
them
grandly
simply
and
with
the
fearless
majesty
of
thought
that
reeked
nothing
of
opinions
oh
he
would
rouse
the
hearts
of
men
from
paltry
greed
and
covetousness
from
lust
and
hatred
and
all
things
evil
no
matter
if
he
lost
his
own
life
in
the
effort
he
would
still
do
his
utmost
best
to
lift
if
only
in
a
small
degree
the
deepening
weight
of
agony
from
mankind
yes
he
must
work
to
fulfil
the
commands
and
deserve
the
blessings
of
edris
edris
ah
the
memory
of
her
pure
rushed
upon
him
like
a
flood
of
invigorating
warmth
and
light
and
when
he
looked
up
from
his
brief
reverie
his
countenance
beautiful
and
kindling
with
inward
ardor
affected
villiers
strangely
almost
as
a
very
grand
and
perfect
strain
of
music
might
affect
and
unsteady
one
nerves
the
attraction
he
had
always
felt
for
his
deepened
to
quite
a
fervent
intensity
of
admiration
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
betray
his
feelings
outwardly
and
to
shake
off
his
emotion
he
rushed
into
speech
again
by
the
by
alwyn
your
old
acquaintance
professor
moxall
is
very
much
on
your
book
you
know
he
does
write
reviews
except
on
matters
connected
with
evolutionary
phenomena
but
i
met
him
the
other
day
and
he
was
quite
upset
about
you
transcendental
he
said
dismally
shaking
his
bald
pate
to
and
fro
whole
poem
is
a
vaporous
tissue
of
absurd
impossibilities
ah
dear
dear
me
what
a
terrible
in
a
young
man
of
such
hopeful
ability
i
thought
he
had
done
with
poetry
forever
i
took
the
greatest
pains
to
prove
to
him
what
a
ridiculous
pastime
it
was
and
how
unworthy
to
be
considered
for
a
moment
seriously
as
an
art
and
he
seemed
to
understand
my
reasoning
thoroughly
indeed
he
promised
to
be
one
of
our
most
powerful
adherents
he
had
an
excellent
grasp
of
the
material
sciences
and
a
fine
contempt
for
religion
why
with
such
a
quick
analytical
brain
as
his
he
might
have
carried
on
darwin
researches
to
an
extremer
point
of
the
origination
of
species
than
has
yet
been
reached
all
a
ruin
sir
a
positive
ruin
a
man
who
will
in
cold
blood
write
such
lines
as
these
grander
is
death
than
life
and
sweeter
far
the
splendors
of
the
infinite
future
than
our
eyes
weary
with
tearful
watching
yet
can
see
condemns
himself
as
a
positive
lunatic
and
young
alwyn
too
he
who
had
so
completely
recognized
the
foolishness
and
futility
of
expecting
any
other
life
than
this
one
good
heavens
nourhalma
as
i
understand
it
is
a
sort
of
pagan
poem
but
with
such
incredible
ideas
and
sentiments
as
are
expressed
in
it
the
author
might
as
well
go
and
be
a
christian
at
once
and
with
that
he
hobbled
off
for
it
was
sunday
afternoon
and
he
was
on
his
way
to
george
hall
to
delight
the
assembled
skeptics
by
telling
them
in
an
elaborate
lecture
what
absurd
animalculae
they
all
were
alwyn
smiled
there
was
a
soft
light
in
his
eyes
an
expression
of
serene
contentment
on
his
face
poor
old
moxall
he
said
gently
i
am
sorry
for
him
he
makes
life
very
desolate
both
for
himself
and
others
who
accept
his
theories
afraid
his
disappointment
in
me
will
have
to
continue
for
as
it
happens
i
am
a
christian
that
is
so
far
as
i
can
in
my
unworthiness
be
a
follower
of
a
faith
so
grand
and
pure
and
true
villiers
started
his
month
opened
in
sheer
astonishment
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
own
ears
and
he
uttered
some
sound
between
a
gasp
and
an
exclamation
of
incredulity
alwyn
met
his
widely
wondering
gaze
with
a
most
sweet
and
unembarrassed
calm
how
amazed
you
look
he
observed
half
playfully
religion
must
be
at
a
very
low
ebb
if
in
a
christian
country
you
are
surprised
to
hear
a
man
openly
acknowledge
himself
a
disciple
of
the
christian
creed
there
was
a
brief
pause
during
which
the
chiming
clock
rang
out
the
hour
musically
on
the
stillness
then
villiers
still
in
a
state
of
most
profound
bewilderment
sat
down
deliberately
in
a
chair
opposite
alwyn
and
placed
one
hand
familiarly
on
his
knee
look
here
old
fellow
he
said
impressively
do
you
really
mean
it
are
you
over
to
some
church
or
other
alwyn
laughed
his
friend
anxiety
was
so
genuine
not
i
he
responded
do
be
alarmed
villiers
i
am
not
a
to
any
particular
set
form
of
faith
what
i
care
for
is
the
faith
itself
one
can
follow
and
serve
christ
without
any
church
dogma
he
has
himself
told
us
plainly
in
words
simple
enough
for
a
child
to
understand
what
he
would
have
us
to
do
and
though
i
like
many
others
must
regret
the
absence
of
a
true
universal
church
where
the
servants
of
christ
may
meet
altogether
without
a
shadow
of
difference
in
opinion
and
worship
him
as
he
should
be
worshipped
still
that
is
no
reason
why
i
should
refrain
from
endeavoring
to
fulfil
as
far
as
in
me
lies
my
personal
duty
toward
him
the
fact
is
christianity
has
never
yet
been
rightly
taught
grasped
or
comprehended
moreover
as
long
as
men
seek
through
it
their
own
worldly
advantage
it
never
will
be
so
that
the
majority
of
the
people
are
really
as
yet
ignorant
of
its
true
spiritual
meaning
thanks
to
the
quarrels
and
differences
of
sects
and
preachers
but
notwithstanding
the
unhappy
position
of
religion
at
the
present
day
i
repeat
i
am
a
christian
if
love
for
christ
and
implicit
belief
in
him
can
make
me
so
he
spoke
simply
and
without
the
slightest
affectation
of
reserve
villiers
was
still
puzzled
i
thought
alwyn
he
ventured
to
say
presently
with
some
little
diffidence
that
you
entirely
rejected
the
idea
of
christ
divinity
as
a
mere
superstition
in
dense
ignorance
of
the
extent
of
god
possibilities
i
certainly
did
so
returned
alwyn
quietly
but
i
have
had
good
reason
to
see
that
my
own
inability
to
comprehend
supernatural
causes
was
entirely
to
blame
for
that
rejection
are
we
able
to
explain
all
the
numerous
and
complex
variations
and
manifestations
of
matter
no
then
why
do
we
dare
to
doubt
the
certainly
conceivable
variations
and
manifestations
of
spirit
the
doctrine
of
a
purely
human
christ
is
untenable
a
creed
founded
on
that
idea
alone
would
make
no
way
with
the
immortal
aspirations
of
the
soul
what
link
could
there
be
between
a
mere
man
like
ourselves
and
heaven
none
whatever
it
needs
the
divine
in
christ
to
overleap
the
darkness
of
the
grave
to
serve
us
as
the
symbol
of
certain
resurrection
to
teach
us
that
this
life
is
not
the
all
but
only
one
loop
in
the
chain
of
existence
only
one
of
the
mansions
in
the
father
house
human
teachers
of
high
morals
there
have
always
been
in
the
world
confucius
buddha
zoroaster
socrates
plato
there
is
no
end
to
them
and
their
teachings
have
been
valuable
so
far
as
they
went
but
even
plato
majestic
arguments
in
favor
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
fall
short
of
anything
sure
and
graspable
there
were
so
many
prefigurements
of
what
was
to
come
just
as
the
sign
of
the
cross
was
used
in
the
temple
of
serapis
and
was
held
in
singular
mystic
veneration
by
various
tribes
of
egyptians
arabians
and
indians
ages
before
christ
came
and
now
that
these
prefigurements
have
resolved
themselves
into
an
actual
divine
symbol
the
doubting
world
still
hesitates
and
by
this
hesitation
paralyzes
both
its
will
and
instinct
so
that
it
fails
to
cut
out
the
core
of
christianity
true
solution
or
to
learn
what
christ
really
meant
when
he
said
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
no
man
cometh
to
the
father
but
by
me
have
you
ever
considered
the
particular
weight
of
that
word
in
that
text
it
is
rightly
specified
that
man
cometh
for
there
are
hosts
of
other
beings
in
other
universes
who
are
not
of
our
puny
race
and
who
do
not
need
to
be
taught
either
the
way
truth
or
life
as
they
know
all
three
and
have
never
lost
their
knowledge
from
the
beginning
his
voice
quivered
a
little
and
he
paused
villiers
watched
him
with
a
strange
sense
of
fascination
and
wonder
i
have
lately
studied
the
whole
thing
carefully
he
resumed
presently
and
i
see
no
reason
why
we
who
call
ourselves
a
progressive
generation
should
revert
back
to
the
old
theory
of
corinthus
who
as
early
as
years
after
christ
denied
his
divinity
there
is
nothing
new
in
the
hypothesis
it
is
no
more
original
than
the
doctrine
of
evolution
which
was
skilfully
enough
handled
by
democritus
and
probably
by
many
another
before
him
voltaire
certainly
threshed
out
the
subject
exhaustively
and
i
think
carlyle
address
to
him
on
the
uselessness
of
his
work
is
one
of
the
finest
of
its
kind
do
you
remember
it
villiers
shook
his
head
in
the
negative
whereupon
alwyn
rose
and
glancing
along
an
evidently
took
from
thence
sartor
resartus
and
turned
over
the
pages
quickly
here
it
is
and
he
read
out
the
following
my
herr
von
voltaire
shut
thy
sweet
voice
for
the
task
appointed
thee
seems
finished
sufficiently
hast
thou
demonstrated
this
proposition
considerable
or
otherwise
that
the
mythus
of
the
christian
religion
looks
not
in
the
eighteenth
century
as
it
did
in
the
eighth
alas
were
thy
quartos
and
the
thousand
other
quartos
and
folios
and
flying
sheets
or
reams
printed
before
and
since
on
the
same
subject
all
needed
to
convince
us
of
so
little
but
what
next
wilt
thou
help
us
to
embody
the
divine
spirit
of
that
religion
in
a
new
mythus
in
a
new
vehicle
and
vesture
that
our
souls
otherwise
too
like
perishing
may
live
what
thou
hast
no
faculty
in
that
kind
only
a
torch
for
burning
and
no
hammer
for
building
take
our
thanks
then
and
thyself
away
villiers
smiled
and
straightened
himself
in
military
fashion
as
was
his
habit
when
particularly
gratified
excellent
old
teufelsdrockh
he
murmured
he
had
a
rugged
method
of
explaining
himself
but
it
was
decisive
enough
in
all
conscience
decisive
and
to
the
point
assented
alwyn
putting
the
book
back
in
its
place
and
then
confronting
his
and
he
states
precisely
what
is
wanted
by
the
world
wanted
pressingly
eagerly
namely
that
the
spirit
of
the
christian
religion
should
be
set
forth
in
a
vehicle
and
vesture
to
keep
pace
with
the
advancing
inquiry
and
scientific
research
of
man
and
truly
for
this
it
need
only
be
expounded
according
to
its
old
pure
primal
spiritual
intention
and
then
the
more
science
progresses
the
more
true
will
it
be
proved
christ
distinctly
claimed
his
divinity
and
everywhere
gave
manifestations
of
it
of
course
it
can
be
said
that
these
manifestations
rest
on
testimony
and
that
the
was
drawn
up
afterward
and
is
a
spurious
invention
but
we
have
no
more
proof
that
it
is
spurious
than
we
have
of
footnote
see
chapter
xiii
in
the
allusion
to
oruzel
homer
iliad
being
a
compilation
of
several
writers
and
not
the
work
of
a
homer
at
all
nothing
not
even
the
events
of
the
past
week
can
be
safely
rested
on
absolute
undiffering
testimony
inasmuch
as
no
two
narrators
tell
the
same
story
alike
but
all
the
same
we
have
the
iliad
it
can
not
be
taken
from
us
by
any
amount
of
argument
and
we
have
the
fruits
of
christ
gospel
half
obscured
as
it
is
visible
among
us
everywhere
civilization
of
a
high
and
aspiring
order
has
followed
christianity
even
at
the
cost
of
blood
and
tears
has
been
abolished
and
women
lifted
from
unspeakable
degradation
to
honor
and
reverence
and
had

been
more
reasonable
and

have
been
done
peacefully

it

upset

name
of
religion
has
been
made
a
ghastly
mockery
that
however
is
not
the
fault
of
christianity
but
the
fault
of
those
who
profess
to
follow
it
like
paul
while
merely
following
a
scheme
of
their
own
personal
advantage
or
convenience
and
the
result
of
it
all
is
that
at
this
very
moment
there
is
not
a
church
in
christendom
where
christ
actual
commands
are
really
and
to
the
letter
fulfilled
strong
ejaculated
villiers
with
a
slight
must
say
that
before
a
clergyman
why
not
demanded
why
should
not
clerics
be
told
once
and
for
all
how
ill
they
perform
their
sacred
mission
look
at
the
wilderness
of
spreading
atheism
and
look
at
the
multitudes
of
men
and
women
who
are
hungering
and
thirsting
for
a
greater
comprehension
of
spiritual
things
than
they
have
hitherto
had
and
yet
the
preachers
trudge
drowsily
on
in
the
old
ruts
they
have
made
for
themselves
and
give
neither
sympathy
nor
heed
to
the
increasing
pain
feverish
bewilderment
and
positive
want
of
those
they
profess
to
guide
concerning
science
too
what
is
the
good
of
telling
a
toiling
more
or
less
suffering
race
that
there
are
eighteen
millions
of
suns
in
the
milky
way
and
that
viewed
by
the
immensity
of
the
universe
man
is
nothing
but
a
small
mean
and
perishable
insect
humanity
hears
the
statement
with
dull
perplexed
brain
and
its
weight
of
sorrow
is
doubled
it
demands
at
once
why
if
an
insect
its
insect
life
should
be
at
all
if
nothing
is
to
come
of
it
but
weariness
and
woe
the
marvels
of
scientific
discovery
offer
no
solace
to
the
huge
majority
of
the
afflicted
unless
we
point
the
lesson
that
the
soul
of
man
is
destined
to
live
through
more
than
these
wonders
and
that
the
millions
of
planetary
systems
in
the
milky
way
are
but
the
alpha
beta
of
the
sublime
hereafter
which
is
our
natural
heritage
if
we
will
but
set
ourselves
earnestly
to
win
it
moreover
we
should
not
foolishly
imagine
that
we
are
to
lead
good
lives
merely
for
the
sake
of
some
suggested
reward
or
wages
no
but
simply
because
in
practising
progressive
good
we
are
equalizing
ourselves
and
placing
ourselves
in
active
working
harmony
with
the
whole
progressive
good
of
the
plan
we
have
no
more
right
to
do
a
deliberately
evil
thing
than
a
musician
has
a
right
to
spoil
a
melody
by
a
false
note
on
his
instrument
why
should
we
willfully
jar
god
music
of
which
we
are
a
part
i
tell
you
that
religion
as
taught
is
rather
one
of
custom
and
fear
than
love
and
confidence
men
cower
and
propitiate
when
they
should
be
full
of
thankfulness
and
praise
and
as
for
any
reserve
on
these
matters
i
have
none
in
fact
i
fail
to
see
why
truth
spiritual
truth
should
not
be
openly
proclaimed
now
even
as
it
is
sure
to
be
proclaimed
hereafter
his
manner
had
warmed
with
his
words
and
he
lifted
his
head
with
an
involuntary
gesture
of
eloquent
resolve
his
eyes
flashing
splendid
scorn
for
all
things
hypocritical
and
mean
villiers
looked
at
him
feeling
curiously
moved
and
impressed
by
his
fervent
earnestness
well
i
was
right
in
one
thing
at
any
rate
alwyn
he
said
you
are
changed
there
not
a
doubt
about
it
but
it
seems
to
me
the
change
is
distinctly
for
the
better
it
does
my
heart
good
to
hear
you
speak
with
such
distinct
and
manly
emphasis
on
a
subject
which
though
it
is
one
of
the
burning
questions
of
the
day
is
too
often
treated
irreverently
or
altogether
dismissed
with
a
few
sentences
of
languid
banter
or
cheap
sarcasm
as
regards
myself
personally
i
must
say
that
a
man
without
faith
in
anything
but
himself
has
always
seemed
to
me
exactly
in
keeping
with
the
description
given
of
an
atheist
by
lady
ashburton
to
carlyle
namely
person
who
robs
himself
not
only
of
clothes
but
of
flesh
as
well
and
walks
about
the
world
in
his
bones
and
oddly
enough
in
spite
of
all
the
controversies
going
on
about
christianity
i
have
always
really
worshipped
christ
in
my
heart
of
hearts
and
i
ca
go
to
church
i
seem
to
lose
the
idea
of
him
altogether
there
but
and
his
frank
face
took
upon
itself
a
dreamy
light
of
deep
feeling
there
are
times
when
walking
alone
in
the
fields
or
through
a
very
quiet
grove
of
trees
or
on
the
i
begin
to
think
of
his
majestic
life
and
death
and
the
immense
unfailing
sympathy
he
showed
for
every
sort
of
human
suffering
and
then
i
can
really
believe
in
him
as
divine
friend
comrade
teacher
and
king
and
i
am
scarcely
able
to
decide
which
is
the
deepest
emotion
in
my
mind
toward
him
love
or
reverence
he
paused
alwyn
eyes
rested
upon
him
with
a
quick
comprehensive
friendliness
in
one
exchange
of
looks
the
two
men
became
mutually
aware
of
the
strong
undercurrents
of
thought
that
lay
beneath
each
other
individual
surface
history
and
that
perhaps
had
never
been
so
clearly
recognized
before
and
a
kind
of
swift
speechless
satisfactory
agreement
between
their
two
separate
natures
seemed
suddenly
drawn
up
ratified
and
sealed
in
a
glance
i
have
often
thought
continued
villiers
more
lightly
and
smiling
as
he
spoke
that
we
are
all
angels
or
devils
angels
in
our
best
moments
devils
in
our
worst
if
we
could
only
keep
the
best
moments
always
uppermost
poor
deluded
human
nature
as
old
moxall
says
while
in
the
same
breath
he
contradicts
himself
by
asserting
that
human
reason
is
the
only
infallible
means
of
ascertaining
anything
how
it
can
be
and
at
the
same
time
i
ca
quite
understand
but
alwyn
you
have
told
me
how
you
like
the
of
your
book
and
he
handed
the
volume
in
question
to
its
author
who
turned
it
over
with
the
most
curious
air
of
careless
recognition
in
his
fancy
he
again
saw
zabastes
writing
each
line
of
it
down
to
dictation
it
very
well
printed
he
said
at
last
and
very
tastefully
bound
you
have
superintended
the
work
con
amore
villiers
and
i
am
as
obliged
to
you
as
friendship
will
let
me
be
you
know
what
that
means
it
means
no
obligation
at
all
declared
villiers
because
friends
who
are
the
least
worthy
the
name
take
delight
in
furthering
each
other
interests
and
have
no
need
to
be
thanked
for
doing
what
is
particularly
agreeable
to
them
you
really
like
the
appearance
of
it
then
but
you
got
the
sixth
edition
this
is
the
first
and
he
took
up
from
a
a
quaint
small
quarto
bound
is
a
very
superb
imitation
of
old
embossed
leather
which
alwyn
beholding
was
at
once
struck
by
the
resemblance
it
bore
to
the
elaborate
designs
that
had
adorned
the
covers
of
the
papyrus
volumes
possessed
by
his
sahluma
this
is
very
sumptuous
he
said
with
a
dreamy
smile
it
looks
quite
antique
does
it
exclaimed
villiers
delighted
i
had
it
copied
from
a
first
edition
of
petrarca
which
happens
to
be
in
my
collection
this
specimen
of
has
become
valuable
and
unique
it
was
published
at
and
ca
be
got
anywhere
under
five
or
six
guineas
if
for
that
of
course
a
copy
of
each
edition
has
been
set
aside
for
you
alwyn
laid
down
the
book
with
a
gentle
indifference
my
dear
fellow
i
had
enough
of
he
said
keep
a
copy
of
the
first
edition
if
only
as
a
souvenir
of
your
and
energy
in
bringing
it
out
so
admirably
but
for
the
rest
the
book
belongs
to
me
no
more
but
to
the
public
and
so
let
the
public
do
with
it
what
they
will
villiers
raised
his
eyebrows
perplexedly
i
believe
after
all
alwyn
you
do
really
care
for
your
fame
not
in
the
least
replied
alwyn
laughing
why
should
i
you
longed
for
it
once
as
the
utmost
good
true
but
there
are
other
utmost
goods
my
friend
that
i
desire
more
keenly
but
are
they
attainable
queried
villiers
men
and
specially
poets
often
hanker
after
what
is
not
possible
to
secure
granted
responded
alwyn
cheerfully
but
i
do
not
crave
for
the
impossible
i
only
seek
to
recover
what
i
have
lost
and
that
is
what
most
men
have
lost
or
are
insanely
doing
their
best
to
lose
said
alwyn
a
grasp
of
things
eternal
through
the
veil
of
things
temporal
there
was
a
short
silence
during
which
villiers
eyed
his
friend
wistfully
what
was
that
you
spoke
about
in
your
letter
from
the
monastery
on
the
pass
of
dariel
he
asked
after
a
while
you
said
you
were
on
the
search
for
a
new
you
experience
it
alwyn
smiled
i
certainly
did
did
it
arise
from
a
contemplation
of
the
site
of
the
ruins
of
babylon
not
exactly
babylon
or
rather
the
which
are
now
called
babylon
had
very
little
to
do
with
it
do
you
want
to
tell
me
about
it
demanded
tilliers
abruptly
not
just
yet
answered
alwyn
with
frankness
not
at
any
rate
but
i
will
tell
you
never
fear
for
the
present
we
talked
enough
do
you
think
bed
suggests
itself
as
a
fitting
conclusion
to
our
converse
villiers
laughed
and
acquiesced
and
after
pressing
his
friend
to
partake
of
something
in
the
way
of
supper
which
refreshment
was
declined
he
preceded
him
to
a
small
pleasantly
cosy
room
his
as
he
called
it
but
which
was
really
almost
exclusively
set
apart
for
alwyn
use
alone
and
was
always
in
readiness
for
him
whenever
he
chose
to
occupy
it
turning
on
the
pretty
electric
lamp
that
lit
the
whole
apartment
with
a
soft
and
shaded
lustre
villiers
shook
hands
heartily
with
his
old
and
favorite
comrade
and
bidding
him
a
brief
but
cordial
left
him
to
repose
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
alwyn
took
out
from
his
breast
pocket
a
small
velvet
from
which
he
gently
drew
forth
a
slightly
pressed
but
unfaded
white
flower
setting
this
in
a
glass
of
water
he
placed
it
near
his
bed
and
watched
it
for
a
moment
delicately
and
gradually
its
pressed
petals
expanded
its
golden
corolla
brightened
in
hue
a
subtle
sweet
odor
permeated
the
air
and
soon
the
angelic
immortelle
of
the
field
of
ardath
shone
wondrously
as
a
white
star
in
the
quiet
room
and
when
the
lamp
was
extinguished
and
the
poet
slept
that
strange
fair
blossom
seemed
to
watch
him
like
a
soft
luminous
eye
in
the
darkness
a
symbol
of
things
divine
and
lasting
a
token
of
far
and
brilliant
worlds
where
even
flowers
can
not
fade
chapter
xxxiii
realism
at
the
end
of
about
a
week
or
so
it
became
very
generally
known
among
the
mystic
upper
ten
of
artistic
and
literary
circles
that
theos
alwyn
the
famous
author
of
nourhalma
was
to
put
it
fashionably
in
town
according
to
the
classic
phrasing
of
a
leading
society
journal
theos
alwyn
the
poet
whom
some
of
our
contemporaries
erroneously
reported
as
dead
has
arrived
in
london
from
his
tour
in
the
east
he
is
for
the
present
a
guest
of
the
honorable
francis
villiers
the
consequence
of
this
and
other
similar
announcements
was
that
the
postman
seemed
never
to
be
away
from
villiers
door
and
every
time
he
came
he
was
laden
with
letters
and
cards
of
invitation
addressed
for
the
most
part
to
villiers
himself
who
with
something
of
dismay
saw
his
study
table
getting
gradually
covered
with
accumulating
piles
of
society
litter
such
as
is
comprised
in
the
various
formal
notifications
of
dinners
dances
balls
soirees
at
homes
and
all
the
divers
sorts
of
entertainment
with
which
the
english
moult
tristement
some
of
these
invitations
less
ceremonious
were
in
form
of
pretty
little
notes
from
great
ladies
who
entreated
their
dear
villiers
to
give
them
the
extreme
honor
and
pleasure
of
his
company
at
certain
select
and
extra
brilliant
receptions
where
royalty
itself
would
be
represented
adding
as
an
earnest
postscript
and
do
bring
the
lion
you
know
your
very
interesting
friend
alwyn
with
you
a
good
many
such
were
addressed
to
alwyn
personally
and
as
he
opened
and
read
them
he
was
somewhat
amused
to
see
how
many
who
had
formerly
been
mere
bowing
acquaintances
were
now
suddenly
almost
magically
transformed
into
apparently
eager
admiring
and
devoted
friends
one
would
think
these
people
really
liked
me
for
myself
he
said
one
morning
tossing
aside
a
particularly
gushing
pressing
note
from
a
lady
who
was
celebrated
for
the
motley
crowds
she
managed
to
squeeze
into
her
rooms
regardless
of
any
one
comfort
or
convenience
and
yet
as
the
matter
stands
they
actually
know
nothing
of
me
i
might
be
a
villain
of
the
deepest
dye
a
kickable
cad
or
a
coarse
ruffian
but
so
long
as
i
have
written
a
book
and
am
a
a
literary
what
matter
my
tastes
my
morals
or
my
disposition
if
this
sort
of
thing
is
fame
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
savors
of
very
detestable
vulgarity
of
course
it
does
assented
but
what
else
do
you
expect
from
modern
society
what
can
you
expect
from
a
community
which
is
chiefly
ruled
by
moneyed
parvenus
but
vulgarity
if
you
go
to
this
woman
place
for
instance
and
he
glanced
at
the
note
alwyn
had
thrown
on
the
table
you
will
share
the
honors
of
the
evening
with
the
famous
of
bond
street
an
in
gowns
the
female
upholsterer
and
house
decorator
likewise
an
the
ladies
who
sonnets
in
regent
street
also
and
chiefest
among
the
motley
crowd
perhaps
the
new
of
aestheticism
a
ponderous
gentleman
who
says
nothing
and
does
nothing
and
who
by
reason
of
his
stupendous
inertia
and
taciturnity
is
considered
the
greatest
of
all
it
no
use
your
going
among
such
people
in
fact
no
one
who
has
any
reverence
left
in
him
for
the
truth
of
art
can
mix
with
those
whose
profession
of
it
is
a
mere
trade
and
hypocritical
sham
such
dunderheads
would
see
no
artistic
difference
between
phidias
and
the
man
of
who
hews
out
and
sets
up
a
common
marble
i
not
a
fellow
to
moan
over
the
old
times
no
not
a
bit
of
it
for
those
good
old
times
had
much
in
them
that
was
decidedly
bad
but
i
wish
progress
would
not
rob
us
altogether
of
refinement
but
society
professes
to
be
growing
more
and
more
cultured
every
day
observed
alwyn
oh
it
professes
yes
that
just
the
mischief
of
it
its
professions
are
not
worth
a
groat
it
professes
to
be
one
thing
while
anybody
with
eyes
can
see
that
it
actually
is
another
the
old
style
of
aristocrat
and
gentleman
is
dying
out
the
new
style
is
the
horsey
lord
the
betting
duke
the
earl
the
viscount
trade
is
a
very
excellent
thing
a
very
necessary
and
important
thing
but
its
influence
is
distinctly
not
refining
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
my
cheesemonger
for
instance
and
he
has
an
equal
respect
for
me
since
he
has
found
that
i
know
the
difference
between
real
butter
and
butterine
but
all
the
same
i
do
want
to
see
him
in
parliament
i
am
arrogant
enough
to
believe
that
i
even
i
having
studied
somewhat
know
more
about
the
country
interest
than
he
does
i
view
it
by
the
light
of
ancient
and
modern
historical
evidence
he
views
it
according
to
the
demand
it
makes
on
his
cheese
we
may
both
be
narrow
and
limited
in
judgment
nevertheless
i
think
with
all
due
modesty
that
his
judgment
is
likely
to
be
more
limited
than
mine
but
it
no
good
talking
about
it
this
dear
old
land
is
given
up
to
a
sort
of
ignorant
democracy
which
only
needs
time
to
become
anarchy
and
we
have
got
a
strong
man
among
us
who
dares
speak
out
the
truth
of
the
inevitable
disasters
looming
above
us
all
and
society
is
not
only
vulgar
but
demoralized
moreover
what
is
worse
is
that
aided
by
its
preachers
and
teachers
it
is
sinking
into
deeper
depths
of
demoralization
with
every
passing
month
and
year
of
time
alwyn
leaned
hack
in
his
chair
thoughtfully
a
sorrowful
expression
clouding
his
face
surely
things
are
not
so
bad
as
they
seem
villiers
he
said
gently
are
you
not
taking
a
pessimistic
view
of
affairs
not
at
all
and
villiers
warming
with
his
subject
walked
up
and
down
the
room
excitedly
nor
am
i
judging
by
the
narrow
observation
of
any
particular
or
circle
i
look
at
the
expressive
visible
outcome
of
the
whole
the
plainly
manifest
signs
of
the
threatening
future
of
course
there
are
ever
so
many
good
people
earnest
people
thinking
people
but
they
are
a
mere
handful
compared
to
the
overpowering
millions
opposed
to
them
and
whose
motto
is
be
thou
my
good
now
you
for
instance
are
full
of
splendid
ideas
and
lucid
plans
of
check
and
reform
you
are
seized
with
a
passionate
desire
to
do
something
great
for
the
world
and
you
are
ready
to
speak
the
truth
fearlessly
on
all
occasions
but
just
think
of
the
enormous
task
it
would
be
to
stir
to
even
half
an
inch
of
aspiring
nobleness
the
frightful
mass
of
corruption
in
london
in
all
trades
and
professions
it
is
the
same
story
everything
is
a
question
of
gain
to
begin
with
look
at
the
church
the
of
the
state
there
all
sorts
of
worthless
incompetent
men
are
hastily
thrust
into
livings
by
wealthy
patrons
who
care
not
a
jot
as
to
whether
they
are
morally
or
intellectually
fit
for
their
sacred
mission
and
a
disgraceful
universal
muddle
is
the
result
from
this
muddle
which
resembles
a
sort
of
stagnant
pool
emerge
the
strangest
clergymen
who
take
to
acting
a
ostensibly
for
the
purposes
of
charity
but
really
to
gratify
their
own
tastes
and
leanings
toward
the
mummer
art
all
the
time
utterly
regardless
of
the
effect
their
behavior
is
likely
to
have
on
the
minds
of
the
unthinking
populace
who
are
led
by
the
newspapers
and
who
read
therein
bantering
inquiries
as
to
whether
the
church
is
coquetting
with
the
stage
whether
the
two
are
likely
to
become
one
and
whether
religion
will
in
the
future
occupy
no
more
serious
consideration
than
the
drama
what
is
one
to
think
when
one
sees
clerical
notabilities
seated
in
the
stalls
of
a
theatre
complacently
looking
on
at
the
representation
of
a
degrading
in
plot
repulsive
in
detail
and
in
nearly
every
case
having
to
do
with
a
married
woman
who
indulges
in
a
lover
as
a
matter
of
course
a
play
full
of
ambiguous
side
hits
and
equivocal
jests
which
if
the
men
of
the
church
were
staunch
to
their
vocation
they
would
be
the
first
to
condemn
why
i
saw
the
other
day
in
a
fairly
reliable
journal
that
some
of
these
excellent
were
going
to
start
sermons
a
sort
of
imitation
of
smoking
concerts
i
suppose
which
are
vile
enough
in
all
conscience
but
to
mix
up
religious
matters
with
the
selfish
mania
is
viler
still
i
say
that
any
clergyman
who
will
allow
men
to
smoke
in
his
presence
while
he
is
preaching
sacred
doctrine
is
a
coarse
cad
and
ought
to
be
hounded
out
of
the
church
he
paused
his
face
flushing
with
vigorous
righteous
wrath
eyes
grew
dark
with
an
infinite
pain
his
thoughts
always
fled
back
to
his
dream
of
with
a
tendency
to
draw
comparisons
between
the
past
and
the
present
the
religion
of
that
city
had
been
mere
mummery
and
splendid
outward
show
what
was
the
religion
of
london
he
moved
restlessly
how
all
the
warnings
of
history
repeat
themselves
he
said
an
age
of
mockery
sham
sentiment
and
irreverence
has
always
preceded
a
downfall
can
it
be
possible
that
we
are
already
receiving
hints
of
the
downfall
of
england
aye
not
only
of
england
but
of
a
good
many
other
nations
besides
said
villiers
or
if
not
actual
downfall
change
and
terrific
upheaval
france
and
england
particularly
are
the
prey
of
the
demon
of
realism
and
all
the
writers
who
should
use
their
pens
to
inspire
and
elevate
the
people
assist
in
degrading
them
when
their
books
are
not
obscene
they
are
blasphemous
russia
too
joins
in
the
cry
of
realism
realism
let
us
have
the
filth
of
the
gutters
the
scourgings
of
dustholes
the
corruption
of
graves
the
odors
of
malaria
the
howlings
of
drunkards
the
revellings
of
sensualists
the
worst
side
of
the
world
in
its
vilest
aspect
which
is
the
only
real
aspect
of
those
who
are
voluntarily
vile
let
us
see
to
what
a
reeking
depth
of
unutterable
shameless
brutality
man
can
fall
if
he
chooses
not
as
formerly
when
it
was
shown
to
what
glorious
heights
of
noble
supremacy
he
could
rise
for
in
this
age
the
heights
are
called
folly
and
the
reeking
depths
are
called
realism
and
yet
what
is
realism
really
queried
does
anybody
know
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
actuality
of
everyday
existence
without
any
touch
of
romance
or
pathos
to
soften
its
frequently
hideous
commonplace
but
the
fact
is
the
commonplace
is
not
the
real
the
highest
flights
of
imagination
in
the
human
being
fail
to
grasp
the
reality
of
the
splendors
everywhere
surrounding
him
and
viewed
rightly
realism
would
become
romance
and
romance
realism
we
see
a
ragged
woman
in
the
streets
picking
up
scraps
for
her
daily
food
that
is
what
we
may
call
realistic
but
we
are
not
looking
at
the
actual
woman
after
all
we
can
not
see
her
inner
self
or
form
any
certain
comprehension
of
the
possible
romance
or
tragedy
which
that
inner
self
has
experienced
or
is
experiencing
we
see
the
outer
appearance
of
the
woman
but
what
of
that
the
realism
of
the
suffering
creature
hidden
history
lies
beyond
us
so
far
beyond
us
that
it
is
called
romance
because
it
seems
so
impossible
to
fathom
or
understand
true
most
absolutely
true
said
villiers
emphatically
but
it
is
a
truth
you
will
get
very
few
to
admit
everything
is
in
a
state
of
substantiality
and
sham
we
have
even
sham
realism
as
well
as
sham
sentiment
sham
religion
sham
art
sham
morality
we
have
a
parliament
that
sits
and
jabbers
lengthy
platitudes
that
lead
to
nothing
while
army
and
navy
are
slowly
slipping
into
a
state
of
helpless
desuetude
and
the
mutterings
of
discontented
millions
are
almost
unregarded
the
spectre
of
revolution
assuming
somewhat
of
the
shape
in
which
it
appalled
the
french
in
is
dimly
approaching
in
the
distance
even
our
london
county
council
hears
the
faint
shadow
of
a
very
prosaic
resemblance
to
the
national
assembly
of
that
era
and
our
weak
efforts
to
cure
cureless
grievances
and
to
deafen
our
ears
to
crying
evils
are
very
similar
to
the
clumsy
attempts
made
by
louis
xvi
and
his
partisans
to
botch
up
a
terribly
bad
business
oh
the
people
the
people
they
are
unquestionably
the
flesh
blood
bone
and
sinew
of
the
country
and
the
english
people
say
what
sneerers
will
to
the
contrary
are
a
good
people
patient
plodding
forbearing
strong
and
on
the
whole
most
but
their
teachers
teach
them
wrongly
and
confuse
their
brains
instead
of
clearing
them
and
throw
a
weight
of
compulsory
education
at
their
heads
without
caring
how
they
may
use
it
or
how
such
a
blow
from
the
clenched
fist
of
knowledge
may
stupefy
and
bewilder
them
and
the
consequence
is
that
now
were
a
strong
man
to
arise
with
a
lucid
brain
an
eloquent
power
of
expressing
truth
a
great
sympathy
with
his
kind
and
an
immense
indifference
to
his
own
fate
in
the
contest
he
could
lead
this
vast
waiting
wandering
growling
london
wheresoever
he
would
what
an
orator
you
are
villiers
said
alwyn
with
a
i
never
heard
you
come
out
so
strongly
before
my
dear
fellow
replied
villiers
in
a
calmer
tone
it
enough
to
make
any
man
with
warm
blood
in
his
veins
feel
everywhere
signs
of
weakness
cowardice
compromise
hesitation
vacillation
incompetency
and
everywhere
in
thoughtful
minds
the
keen
sense
of
a
fate
advancing
like
the
giant
in
the
boots
at
huge
strides
every
day
the
ponderous
law
and
the
solid
police
hem
us
in
on
each
side
as
though
the
nation
were
a
helpless
infant
toddling
between
two
portly
nurses
we
dare
not
denounce
a
scoundrel
and
liar
but
must
needs
put
up
with
him
lest
we
should
be
involved
in
an
action
for
libel
and
we
dare
not
knock
down
a
vulgar
bully
lest
we
should
be
given
in
charge
for
assault
hence
liars
and
scoundrels
and
vulgar
bullies
abound
and
men
skulk
and
grin
and
play
the
till
they
lose
all
manfulness
society
sits
smirking
foolishly
on
the
top
of
a
smouldering
volcano
and
the
chief
symbols
of
greatness
among
us
religion
poesy
art
are
burning
as
feebly
as
tapers
in
the
catacombs
the
church
resembles
a
drudge
who
tired
of
routine
is
gradually
sinking
into
laziness
and
inertia
and
the
press
ye
gods
the
press
here
speech
seemed
to
fail
him
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
to
relieve
his
mind
kicked
away
the
advertisement
sheet
of
the
newspaper
with
so
much
angry
vehemence
that
alwyn
laughed
outright
what
ails
you
now
villiers
he
demanded
you
are
a
regular
a
crusader
against
a
modern
saracen
host
why
are
you
choked
with
such
seemingly
unutterable
wrath
what
of
the
press
it
is
at
any
rate
free
free
cried
villiers
sitting
bolt
upright
and
shooting
out
the
word
like
a
bullet
from
a
gun
free
the
press
it
is
the
veriest
bound
slave
that
was
ever
hampered
by
the
chains
of
party
prejudice
and
the
only
attempt
at
freedom
it
ever
makes
in
its
lower
grades
is
an
occasional
outbreak
into
scurrility
and
yet
think
what
a
majestic
power
for
good
the
true
real
liberty
of
the
press
might
wield
over
the
destinies
of
nations
broadly
viewed
the
press
should
be
the
strong
practical
helping
right
hand
of
civilization
dealing
out
equal
justice
equal
sympathy
equal
instruction
it
should
be
the
fosterer
of
the
arts
and
sciences
the
everyday
guide
of
the
morals
and
culture
of
the
people
it
should
not
specially
advocate
any
cause
save
honor
it
should
be
as
far
as
possible
the
unanimous
voice
of
the
nation
it
should
be
but
what
is
it
look
round
and
judge
for
yourself
every
daily
paper
panders
more
or
less
to
the
lowest
tastes
of
the
mob
while
if
the
higher
sentiments
of
man
are
not
actually
sneered
at
they
are
made
a
subject
for
feeble
surprise
or
vapid
an
act
of
heroic
unselfishness
meets
with
such
a
cackling
chorus
of
amazed
approval
from
the
writers
that
one
is
forced
to
accept
the
suggestion
implied
namely
that
to
be
heroic
or
unselfish
is
evidently
an
outbreak
of
noble
instinct
that
is
entirely
unexpected
and
remarkable
nay
even
eccentric
and
inexplicable
the
spirit
of
mockery
pervades
everything
and
while
the
story
of
a
murder
is
allowed
to
occupy
three
and
four
columns
of
print
the
account
of
some
great
scientific
discovery
or
the
report
of
some
famous
literary
or
artistic
achievement
is
squeezed
into
a
few
lukewarm
and
unsatisfactory
lines
i
have
seen
a
female
paragraphist
idiotic
description
of
an
gown
allowed
to
take
more
space
in
a
journal
than
the
review
of
a
book
moreover
if
an
honest
man
desirous
of
giving
vent
to
an
honest
opinion
on
some
crying
abuse
of
the
day
were
to
set
forth
that
opinion
in
letter
form
and
try
to
get
it
published
in
a
leading
and
important
newspaper
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
that
it
would
never
he
inserted
unless
he
happened
to
know
the
editor
or
one
of
the
staff
and
perhaps
not
even
then
because
mark
you
his
opinion
must
be
in
accordance
with
the
literary
editor
opinion
or
it
will
be
considered
of
no
value
to
the
world
consider
that
gigantic
absurdity
consider
that
when
we
read
our
newspapers
we
are
not
learning
the
views
of
europe
on
a
certain
point
we
are
absorbing
the
ideas
of
the
editor
to
whom
everything
must
be
submitted
before
insertion
in
the
oracular
columns
we
pin
our
faith
on
thus
it
is
that
criticism
literary
criticism
at
any
rate
is
a
lost
art
you
know
that
a
man
must
either
be
dead
or
considered
dead
or
in
a
to
receive
any
open
encouragement
at
all
from
the
critics
and
the
cliquey
men
are
generally
such
stupendous
bigots
for
their
own
particular
and
restricted
form
of
anything
new
they
hate
anything
daring
they
treat
with
ridicule
some
of
them
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
they
prefer
matthew
arnold
remember
he
dead
to
tennyson
and
swinburne
as
yet
living
while
as
a
fact
if
we
are
to
go
by
the
high
standards
of
poetical
art
left
us
by
shakespeare
keats
shelley
and
byron
matthew
arnold
is
about
the
very
tamest
most
unimaginative
bald
bard
that
ever
kindled
a
lucifer
match
of
verse
and
fancied
it
the
fire
of
apollo
it
utterly
impossible
to
get
either
a
just
or
broad
view
of
literature
out
of
cliques
and
the
press
like
many
of
our
other
institutions
is
working
entirely
on
a
wrong
system
but
who
is
going
to
be
wise
or
strong
or
diplomatic
enough
to
reform
it
no
one
at
present
and
we
shall
jog
along
and
read
up
the
details
of
vice
in
our
dailies
and
weeklies
till
we
almost
lose
the
savor
of
virtue
and
till
the
last
degraded
end
comes
of
it
all
and
blatant
young
america
thrones
herself
on
the
shores
of
britain
and
sends
her
eagle
screech
of
conquest
echoing
over
old
world
and
new
do
think
it
villiers
exclaimed
alwyn
there
is
a
mettle
in
the
english
that
will
never
be
conquered
villiers
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
will
hope
so
my
dear
boy
he
said
resignedly
but
the
under
bad
government
with
bad
weapons
and
more
or
less
untried
ships
can
scarcely
be
blamed
if
it
should
not
be
able
to
resist
a
tremendous
force
majeure
besides
all
the
parliaments
in
the
world
can
not
upset
the
laws
of
the
universe
if
things
are
false
and
corrupt
they
must
be
swept
away
nature
will
not
have
them
she
will
transmute
and
transform
them
somehow
no
matter
at
what
cost
it
is
the
cry
of
the
old
prophets
over
again
ye
have
not
obeyed
god
law
therefore
shall
ye
meet
with
destruction
egoism
is
certainly
not
god
law
and
we
shall
have
to
return
on
our
imagined
progressive
steps
and
be
beaten
with
rods
of
affliction
till
we
understand
what
his
law
is
it
is
for
one
thing
the
wheel
that
keeps
this
universe
going
our
laws
are
no
use
whatever
in
the
management
of
his
sublime
cosmos
nations
like
individuals
are
punished
for
their
own
wilful
misdeeds
the
punishment
may
be
tardy
but
sure
as
death
it
comes
and
i
fancy
america
will
be
our
in
the
lord
hand
as
the
bible
hath
it
that
pretty
young
republican
wants
an
aristocracy
she
will
engraft
it
on
the
old
roots
here
in
fact
she
has
already
begun
to
engraft
it
it
is
even
on
the
cards
that
she
may
need
a
monarchy
if
she
does
she
will
plant
here
then
it
will
be
time
for
englishmen
to
adopt
another
country
and
forget
if
they
can
their
own
disgraced
nationality
and
yet
if
as
shakespeare
says
england
were
to
herself
but
true
if
she
had
great
statesmen
as
of
yore
intellectual
earnest
fearless
unhesitating
workers
who
would
devote
themselves
heart
and
soul
to
her
welfare
she
might
gather
not
only
her
colonies
but
america
also
to
her
knee
as
a
mother
gathers
children
and
the
most
magnificent
christian
empire
the
world
has
ever
seen
might
rise
up
a
supreme
marvel
of
civilization
and
union
that
would
make
all
other
nations
wonder
and
revere
but
the
selfishness
of
the
day
and
the
ruling
passion
of
gain
are
the
fatal
obstructions
in
the
path
of
such
a
desirable
millennium
he
ended
abruptly
he
had
unburdened
his
mind
to
one
who
he
knew
understood
him
and
sympathized
with
him
and
he
turned
to
the
perusal
of
some
letters
just
received
the
two
friends
were
sitting
that
morning
in
the
a
charming
little
octagonal
apartment
looking
out
on
a
small
very
small
garden
which
despite
the
london
atmosphere
looked
just
now
very
bright
with
tastefully
arranged
parterres
of
white
and
yellow
crocuses
mingled
with
the
soft
blue
of
the
dainty
hepatica
that
little
blossom
which
seems
to
express
such
an
honest
confidence
in
the
goodness
of
god
sky
a
few
sparrows
of
dissipated
appearance
were
bathing
their
sooty
plumes
in
a
pool
of
equally
sooty
water
left
in
the
garden
as
a
token
of
last
night
rain
and
they
splashed
and
twittered
and
debated
and
fussed
with
each
other
concerning
their
ablutions
with
almost
as
much
importance
as
could
have
been
displayed
by
the
effeminate
romans
of
the
augustan
era
when
disporting
themselves
in
their
sumptuous
thermae
alwyn
eyes
rested
on
them
unseeingly
his
thoughts
were
very
far
away
from
all
his
surroundings
before
his
imagination
rose
a
picture
of
the
world
in
which
he
had
to
live
the
world
of
fashion
and
form
and
usage
the
world
he
was
to
try
and
rouse
to
a
sense
of
better
things
a
promethean
task
indeed
to
fill
human
life
with
new
symbols
of
hope
to
set
up
a
white
standard
of
faith
amid
the
swift
rushing
on
and
reckless
tramping
down
of
desperate
battle
to
pour
out
on
all
rich
or
poor
worthy
or
unworthy
the
balm
of
sympathy
which
when
given
freely
and
sincerely
from
man
to
man
serves
often
as
a
check
to
vice
a
silent
yet
all
eloquent
rebuke
to
crime
and
can
more
easily
instill
into
refractory
intelligences
things
of
god
and
desires
for
good
than
any
preacher
argument
no
matter
how
finely
worded
to
touch
the
big
wayward
better
heart
of
humanity
could
he
in
very
truth
do
it
or
was
the
work
too
vast
for
his
ability
tormented
by
various
of
feeling
he
gave
vent
to
a
troubled
sigh
and
looked
dubiously
at
his
friend
in
such
a
state
of
things
as
you
describe
villiers
he
aid
what
a
useless
unit
am
a
poet
who
wants
me
in
this
age
of
sale
and
barter
is
not
a
producer
of
poems
always
considered
more
or
less
of
a
fool
nowadays
no
matter
how
much
his
works
may
be
in
fashion
for
the
moment
i
am
sure
in
spite
of
the
success
of
that
the
era
of
poetry
has
passed
and
moreover
it
certainly
seems
to
have
given
place
to
the
very
baldest
and
most
unbeauteous
forms
of
prose
as
for
instance
if
a
book
is
written
which
contains
what
is
called
prose
the
critics
are
all
ready
to
denounce
it
as
for
effect
and
sublime
reisebilder
which
is
one
of
the
most
exquisite
poems
in
prose
ever
given
to
the
world
is
nearly
incomprehensible
to
the
majority
of
english
minds
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
english
translators
in
their
rendering
of
it
have
not
only
lost
the
delicate
glamour
of
its
fancifulness
but
have
also
blunted
all
the
fine
points
of
its
dazzling
sarcasm
and
wealth
of
imagery
it
is
evident
enough
that
the
larger
mass
of
people
prefer
mediocrity
to
high
excellence
else
such
a
number
of
merely
mediocre
works
of
art
would
not
and
could
not
be
tolerated
and
as
long
as
mediocrity
is
permitted
to
hold
ground
it
is
almost
an
impossibility
to
do
much
toward
raising
the
standard
of
literature
the
few
who
love
the
best
authors
are
as
a
mere
drop
in
the
ocean
of
those
who
not
only
choose
the
worst
but
who
also
fail
to
see
any
difference
between
good
and
bad
true
enough
assented
villiers
still
the
you
speak
of
are
worth
all
the
rest
for
the
homer
wrote
plato
marcus
aurelius
epictetus
and
the
are
capable
of
teaching
the
majority
if
they
will
only
set
about
it
rightly
but
at
present
they
are
setting
about
it
wrongly
all
children
are
taught
to
read
but
no
child
is
guided
in
what
to
read
this
is
like
giving
a
loaded
gun
to
a
boy
and
saying
away
no
matter
in
which
direction
you
point
your
aim
shoot
yourself
if
you
like
and
others
too
anyhow
you
got
the
gun
of
course
there
are
a
few
fellows
who
have
occasionally
drawn
up
a
list
of
books
as
suitable
for
everybody
perusal
but
then
these
lists
can
not
be
taken
as
true
criterions
as
they
all
differ
from
one
another
as
much
as
church
sects
one
instructor
in
the
art
of
reading
says
we
ought
all
to
study
jones
now
i
do
see
the
necessity
of
that
and
oddly
enough
these
lists
scarcely
ever
include
the
name
of
a
poet
which
is
the
absurdest
mistake
ever
made
a
liberal
education
in
the
highest
works
of
poesy
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
thinking
abilities
of
man
but
alwyn
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
about
what
is
good
for
the
million
and
what
is
whatever
you
write
is
sure
to
be
read
now
you
got
the
ear
of
the
public
the
large
ear
of
the
ass
head
which
disguises
bottom
the
weaver
who
frankly
says
of
himself
am
such
a
tender
ass
if
my
hair
do
but
tickle
me
i
must
scratch
alwyn
smiled
he
was
thinking
of
what
his
had
said
on
this
very
subject
a
book
or
poem
to
be
great
and
keep
its
greatness
hereafter
must
be
judged
by
the
natural
instinct
of
peoples
this
decision
has
never
yet
been
and
never
will
be
hastened
by
any
amount
of
written
criticism
it
is
the
responsive
beat
of
the
enormous
pulse
of
life
that
thrills
through
all
mankind
high
and
low
gentle
and
simple
its
great
throbs
are
slow
and
solemnly
measured
yet
if
once
it
answers
to
a
poet
touch
that
poet
name
is
made
glorious
forever
in
the
character
of
had
seemed
to
utter
these
sentiments
many
ages
ago
and
now
the
words
repeated
themselves
in
his
thoughts
with
a
new
and
deep
intensity
of
meaning
of
course
added
villiers
suddenly
you
must
expect
plenty
of
adverse
criticism
now
as
it
is
known
beyond
all
doubt
that
you
are
alive
and
able
to
read
what
is
written
concerning
you
but
if
you
once
pay
attention
to
critics
you
may
as
well
put
aside
pen
altogether
as
it
is
the
business
of
these
worthies
never
to
be
entirely
satisfied
with
anything
even
shelley
and
byron
in
the
critical
capacity
abused
keats
till
the
poor
suffering
youth
who
promised
to
be
greater
then
either
of
them
died
of
a
broken
heart
as
much
as
disease
this
sort
of
injustice
will
go
on
to
the
end
of
time
or
till
men
become
more
christianized
than
paul
version
of
christianity
has
ever
yet
made
them
here
a
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
the
conversation
the
servant
entered
bringing
a
note
gorgeously
crested
and
coroneted
in
gold
villiers
to
whom
it
was
addressed
opened
and
read
it
what
shall
we
do
about
this
he
asked
when
his
man
had
retired
it
is
an
invitation
from
the
duchess
de
la
santoisie
she
asks
us
to
go
and
dine
with
her
next
week
a
party
of
twenty
reception
afterward
i
think
we
better
accept
what
do
you
say
alwyn
roused
himself
from
his
reverie
anything
to
please
you
my
dear
boy
he
answered
cheerfully
but
i
have
the
faintest
idea
who
the
duchess
de
la
santoisie
is
no
well
she
an
englishwoman
who
has
married
a
french
duke
he
is
a
delightful
old
fellow
the
pink
of
courtesy
and
the
model
of
perfect
egotism
a
true
parisian
and
of
course
an
atheist
a
very
polished
atheist
too
with
a
most
charming
reliance
on
his
own
infallibility
his
wife
writes
novels
which
have
a
slight
leaning
toward
zolaism
she
is
an
extremely
witty
woman
sarcastic
and
enough
to
be
a
female
robespierre
yet
on
the
whole
amusing
as
a
study
of
what
curious
nondescript
forms
the
feminine
nature
can
adopt
unto
itself
if
it
chooses
she
has
an
immense
respect
for
genius
mind
i
say
genius
advisedly
because
she
really
is
one
of
those
rare
few
who
can
not
endure
mediocrity
everything
at
her
house
is
the
best
of
its
kind
and
the
people
she
entertains
are
the
best
of
theirs
her
welcome
of
you
will
be
at
any
rate
a
sincerely
admiring
one
and
as
i
think
in
spite
of
your
desire
for
quiet
you
will
have
to
show
yourself
somewhere
it
may
as
well
be
there
alwyn
looked
dubious
and
not
at
all
resigned
to
the
prospect
of
showing
himself
your
description
of
her
does
not
strike
me
as
particularly
attractive
he
said
i
can
not
endure
that
hermaphroditic
production
a
mannish
woman
oh
but
she
is
altogether
mannish
declared
villiers
besides
i
must
forget
to
add
that
she
is
extremely
beautiful
alwyn
shrugged
his
shoulders
indifferently
his
friend
noticed
the
gesture
and
laughed
still
impervious
to
beauty
old
boy
he
said
gayly
you
always
were
i
remember
alwyn
flushed
a
little
and
rose
from
his
chair
not
always
he
answered
steadily
there
have
been
times
in
my
life
when
the
beauty
of
women
mere
physical
beauty
has
exercised
great
influence
over
me
but
i
have
lately
learned
how
a
fair
face
may
sometimes
mask
a
foul
mind
and
unless
i
can
see
the
substance
of
soul
looking
through
the
semblance
of
body
then
i
know
that
the
beauty
i
seem
to
behold
is
mere
appearance
and
not
reality
hence
unless
your
beautiful
duchess
be
like
the
daughter
of
david
psalm
glorious
within
her
apparent
loveliness
will
have
no
charm
for
me
now
and
he
smiled
and
spoke
in
a
less
serious
if
you
have
no
objection
i
am
off
to
my
room
to
scribble
for
an
hour
or
so
come
for
me
if
you
want
me
you
know
i
do
in
the
least
mind
being
disturbed
but
villiers
detained
him
a
moment
and
looked
inquisitively
at
him
full
in
the
eyes
you
got
some
singular
new
attraction
about
you
alwyn
he
said
with
a
strange
sense
of
keen
inward
excitement
as
he
met
his
calm
yet
flashing
glance
something
mysterious
something
that
compels
what
is
it
i
believe
that
visit
of
yours
to
the
ruins
of
babylon
had
a
more
important
motive
than
you
will
admit
i
believe
you
are
in
love
in
love
alwyn
laughed
a
little
as
he
repeated
the
what
a
foolish
term
that
is
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
for
to
be
in
love
suggests
the
possibility
of
getting
out
again
which
if
love
be
true
can
never
happen
say
that
i
love
and
you
will
be
nearer
the
mark
now
do
look
so
mystified
and
do
ask
me
any
more
questions
just
now
when
we
are
sitting
together
in
the
library
i
tell
you
the
whole
story
of
my
babylonian
adventure
and
with
a
light
parting
wave
of
the
hand
he
left
the
room
and
villiers
heard
him
humming
a
tune
softly
to
himself
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
to
his
own
apartments
where
ever
since
he
arrived
he
had
made
it
his
custom
to
do
two
or
three
hours
steady
writing
every
morning
for
a
moment
or
so
after
he
had
gone
villiers
stood
lost
in
thought
with
knitted
brows
and
meditative
eyes
then
rousing
himself
he
went
on
to
his
study
and
sitting
down
at
his
desk
wrote
an
answer
to
the
duchess
de
la
santoisie
accepting
her
invitation
chapter
xxxiv
rewards
of
fame
an
habitual
resident
in
london
who
is
gifted
with
a
keen
faculty
of
hearing
and
observation
will
soon
learn
to
know
instinctively
the
various
characteristics
of
the
people
who
call
upon
him
by
the
particular
manner
in
which
each
one
handles
his
or
knocker
he
will
recognize
the
timid
from
the
bold
the
modest
from
the
arrogant
the
meditative
thinker
from
the
bustling
man
of
fashion
the
familiar
friend
from
the
formal
acquaintance
every
individual
method
of
announcing
his
or
her
arrival
to
the
household
is
distinctly
different
and
villiers
who
studied
a
little
of
everything
had
not
failed
to
take
note
of
the
curiously
diversified
degrees
of
single
and
double
rapping
by
means
of
which
his
visitors
sought
admittance
to
his
abode
in
fact
he
rather
prided
himself
on
being
able
to
guess
with
almost
invariable
correctness
what
special
type
of
man
or
woman
was
at
his
door
provided
he
could
hear
the
whole
diapason
of
their
knock
from
beginning
to
end
when
he
was
shut
in
his
den
however
the
sounds
were
muffled
by
distance
and
he
could
form
no
just
judgment
sometimes
indeed
he
did
not
hear
them
at
all
especially
if
he
happened
to
be
playing
his
at
the
time
so
that
this
morning
he
was
considerably
startled
when
having
finished
his
letter
to
the
duchess
de
la
santoisie
a
long
and
persistent
echoed
noisily
through
the
house
like
the
smart
quick
blows
of
a
carpenter
hammer
a
species
of
knock
that
was
entirely
unfamiliar
to
him
and
that
while
so
emphatic
in
character
suggested
to
his
mind
neither
friend
nor
foe
he
laid
down
his
pen
listened
and
waited
in
a
minute
or
two
his
servant
entered
the
room
if
you
please
sir
a
lady
to
see
alwyn
shall
i
show
her
up
villiers
rose
slowly
out
of
his
chair
and
stood
eyeing
his
man
in
blank
bewilderment
a
lady
to
see
mr
alwyn
he
repeated
his
thoughts
instantly
reverting
to
his
friend
vaguely
hinted
what
name
she
gives
no
name
sir
she
says
it
is
needed
alwyn
will
know
who
she
is
alwyn
will
know
who
she
is
will
he
murmured
villiers
what
is
she
like
young
and
pretty
over
the
staid
countenance
came
the
glimmer
of
a
demure
respectful
smile
oh
no
sir
not
young
sir
a
person
about
fifty
i
should
say
this
was
mystifying
a
person
about
fifty
who
could
she
be
villiers
hastily
considered
there
must
be
some
mistake
he
thought
at
any
rate
he
would
see
the
unknown
intruder
himself
first
and
find
out
what
her
business
was
before
breaking
in
upon
alwyn
peaceful
studies
upstairs
show
the
lady
in
here
he
said
i
ca
disturb
alwyn
just
now
the
servant
retired
and
soon
ushering
in
a
tall
gaunt
female
who
walked
with
the
stride
of
a
dragoon
and
the
demeanor
of
a
and
who
merely
nodding
briskly
in
response
to
villiers
amazed
bow
selected
with
one
comprehensive
glance
the
most
comfortable
chair
in
the
room
and
seated
herself
at
ease
therein
she
then
put
up
her
veil
displaying
a
long
narrow
face
cold
pale
arrogant
eyes
a
nose
inclined
to
redness
at
the
tip
and
a
thin
mouth
lined
with
little
sarcastic
wrinkles
which
came
into
prominent
and
unbecoming
play
as
soon
as
she
began
to
speak
which
she
did
almost
immediately
i
suppose
i
had
better
introduce
myself
to
you
alwyn
she
said
with
a
condescending
and
confident
air
though
really
we
know
each
other
so
well
by
reputation
that
there
seems
scarcely
any
necessity
for
it
of
course
you
have
heard
of
villiers
gazed
at
her
helplessly
he
had
never
felt
so
uncomfortable
in
all
his
life
here
was
a
strange
woman
who
had
actually
taken
bodily
possession
of
his
apartment
as
though
it
were
her
own
who
had
settled
herself
down
in
his
particular
pet
louis
quatorze
chair
who
stared
at
him
with
the
scrutinizing
complacency
of
a
professional
physiognomist
and
who
seemed
to
think
no
explanation
of
her
extraordinary
conduct
was
necessary
inasmuch
as
of
course
he
villiers
had
heard
of
it
was
very
singular
almost
like
madness
perhaps
she
was
mad
how
could
he
tell
she
had
a
remarkably
high
knobby
brow
a
brow
with
an
unpleasantly
bald
appearance
owing
to
the
uncompromising
way
in
which
her
hair
was
brushed
well
off
it
he
had
seen
such
brows
before
in
certain
spiritualists
who
believed
or
pretended
to
believe
in
the
suddenly
willed
dematerialization
of
matter
and
they
were
mad
he
knew
or
else
very
foolishly
feigning
madness
endeavoring
to
compose
his
bewildered
mind
he
fixed
glass
in
eye
and
regarded
her
through
it
with
an
inquiring
solemnity
he
would
have
spoken
but
before
he
could
utter
a
word
she
went
on
rapidly
you
are
not
in
the
least
like
the
person
i
imagined
you
to
be
however
that
does
matter
literary
celebrities
are
always
so
different
to
what
we
expect
pardon
me
madam
began
villiers
you
are
making
a
slight
error
my
servant
probably
did
not
explain
i
am
not
alwyn
my
name
is
villiers
alwyn
is
my
guest
but
he
is
at
present
very
much
occupied
and
unless
your
business
is
extremely
urgent
certainly
it
is
urgent
said
the
lady
otherwise
i
should
not
have
come
and
so
you
are
not
alwyn
well
i
thought
you
could
be
now
then
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
tell
alwyn
i
am
here
by
this
time
villiers
had
recovered
his
customary
and
he
met
her
commanding
glance
with
a
somewhat
defiant
coolness
i
am
not
aware
to
whom
i
have
the
honor
of
speaking
he
said
frigidly
perhaps
you
will
oblige
me
with
your
name
my
name
does
in
the
least
matter
she
replied
calmly
though
i
will
tell
you
afterward
if
you
wish
but
you
do
seem
to
understand
i
am
the
situation
was
becoming
ludicrous
villiers
felt
strongly
disposed
to
laugh
i
afraid
i
am
very
ignorant
he
said
with
a
humorous
sparkle
in
his
blue
eyes
but
really
i
am
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
your
meaning
will
you
explain
the
lady
nose
grew
deeper
of
tint
and
the
look
she
shot
at
him
had
quite
a
killing
vindictiveness
with
evident
difficulty
she
forced
a
smile
oh
you
must
have
heard
of
me
she
declared
with
a
ponderous
attempt
at
playfulness
you
read
the
papers
do
you
some
of
them
returned
villiers
cautiously
not
all
not
the
sunday
ones
for
instance
still
you
ca
possibly
have
helped
seeing
my
descriptions
of
famous
people
home
you
know
i
write
for
ever
so
many
journals
i
think
and
she
became
complacently
reflective
i
think
i
may
say
with
perfect
truth
that
i
have
interviewed
everybody
who
has
ever
done
anything
worth
noting
from
our
biggest
provision
dealer
to
our
latest
sensational
novelist
and
all
my
articles
are
signed
now
do
you
remember
oh
you
must
remember
i
am
so
very
well
known
there
was
a
touch
of
genuine
anxiety
in
her
voice
that
was
almost
pathetic
but
villiers
made
no
attempt
to
soothe
her
wounded
vanity
i
have
no
recollection
whatever
of
the
name
he
said
bluntly
but
that
is
easily
accounted
for
as
i
never
read
newspaper
descriptions
of
celebrities
so
you
are
an
for
the
press
exactly
and
the
lady
leaned
back
more
comfortably
in
the
louis
quatorze
fauteuil
and
of
course
i
want
to
interview
alwyn
i
want
here
drawing
out
a
business
looking
from
her
pocket
she
opened
it
and
glanced
at
the
different
headings
therein
enumerated
i
want
to
describe
his
personal
appearance
to
know
when
he
was
born
and
where
he
was
educated
whether
his
father
or
mother
had
literary
tastes
whether
he
had
or
has
brothers
or
sisters
or
both
whether
he
is
married
or
likely
to
be
and
how
much
money
he
has
made
by
his
book
she
paused
and
gave
an
upward
glance
at
villiers
who
returned
it
with
a
blank
and
stony
stare
then
she
resumed
energetically
i
wish
to
know
what
are
his
methods
of
work
where
he
gets
his
ideas
and
how
he
elaborates
them
how
many
hours
he
writes
at
a
time
and
whether
he
is
an
early
riser
also
what
he
usually
takes
for
dinner
whether
he
drinks
wine
or
is
a
total
abstainer
and
at
what
hour
he
retires
to
rest
all
this
is
so
intensely
interesting
to
the
public
perhaps
he
might
be
inclined
to
give
me
a
few
notes
of
his
recent
tour
in
the
east
and
of
course
i
should
be
very
glad
if
he
will
state
his
opinions
on
the
climate
customs
and
governments
of
the
countries
through
which
he
has
passed
it
a
great
pity
this
is
not
his
own
house
it
is
a
pretty
place
and
a
description
of
it
would
read
well
let
me
see
and
she
meditated
i
think
i
could
manage
to
insert
a
few
lines
about
this
apartment
it
would
be
easy
to
say
picturesque
library
in
the
house
of
the
honble
francis
villiers
where
alwyn
received
me
yes
that
would
do
very
well
very
well
indeed
i
should
like
to
know
whether
he
has
a
residence
of
his
own
anywhere
and
if
not
whether
he
intends
to
take
one
in
london
because
in
the
latter
case
it
would
be
as
well
to
ascertain
by
whom
he
intends
to
have
it
furnished
a
little
discussion
on
upholstery
is
so
specially
fascinating
to
my
readers
then
naturally
i
am
desirous
to
learn
how
the
erroneous
rumor
of
his
death
was
first
started
whether
in
the
course
of
his
travels
he
met
with
some
serious
accident
or
illness
which
gave
rise
to
the
report
now
and
she
shut
her
and
folded
her
hands
i
do
mind
waiting
an
hour
or
more
if
necessary
but
i
am
sure
if
you
will
tell
alwyn
who
i
am
and
what
i
have
come
for
he
will
be
only
too
delighted
to
see
me
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
she
ceased
villiers
drew
a
long
breath
his
compressed
lips
parted
in
a
slightly
sarcastic
smile
squaring
his
shoulders
with
that
peculiar
pugnacious
gesture
of
his
which
always
indicated
to
those
who
knew
him
well
that
his
mind
was
made
up
and
that
nothing
would
induce
him
to
alter
it
he
said
in
a
tone
of
stiff
civility
i
am
sorry
madam
very
sorry
but
i
am
compelled
to
inform
you
that
your
visit
here
is
entirely
useless
were
i
to
tell
my
friend
of
the
purpose
you
have
in
view
concerning
him
he
would
not
feel
so
much
flattered
as
you
seem
to
imagine
but
rather
insulted
excuse
my
frankness
you
have
spoken
plainly
i
must
speak
plainly
too
provision
dealers
and
sensational
story
writers
may
find
that
it
serves
their
purpose
to
be
interviewed
if
only
as
a
means
of
gaining
extra
advertisement
but
a
truly
great
and
conscientious
author
like
theos
alwyn
is
quite
above
all
that
sort
of
thing
the
lady
raised
her
pale
eyebrows
with
an
expression
of
interrogative
scorn
above
all
that
sort
of
thing
she
echoed
incredulously
dear
me
how
very
extraordinary
i
have
always
found
all
our
celebrities
so
exceedingly
pleased
to
be
given
a
little
additional
notoriety
and
i
should
have
thought
a
poet
this
with
much
depreciative
emphasis
would
have
been
particularly
glad
of
the
chance
because
of
course
you
know
that
unless
a
very
astonishing
success
is
made
as
in
the
case
of
alwyn
people
really
take
such
slight
interest
in
writers
of
verse
that
it
is
hardly
ever
worth
while
interviewing
them
precisely
agreed
villiers
ironically
the
private
history
of
a
would
naturally
be
much
more
thrilling
he
paused
his
temper
was
fast
rising
but
quickly
reflecting
that
after
all
the
indignation
he
felt
was
not
so
much
against
his
visitor
as
against
the
system
she
represented
he
resumed
quietly
may
i
ask
you
madam
whether
you
have
ever
her
majesty
the
queen
her
glance
swept
slightingly
over
him
certainly
not
such
a
thing
would
be
impossible
then
you
have
never
thought
went
on
villiers
with
a
thrill
of
earnestness
in
his
manly
vibrating
voice
that
it
might
be
quite
as
impossible
to
a
great
poet
who
if
great
indeed
is
in
every
way
as
royal
as
any
sovereign
that
ever
adorned
a
throne
i
do
not
speak
of
petty
i
say
a
great
poet
by
which
term
i
imply
a
great
creative
genius
who
is
honestly
faithful
to
his
high
vocation
such
an
one
could
no
more
tell
you
his
methods
of
work
than
a
rainbow
could
prattle
about
the
way
it
shines
and
as
for
his
personal
history
i
should
like
to
know
by
what
right
society
is
entitled
to
pry
into
the
sacred
matters
of
a
man
private
life
simply
because
he
happens
to
be
famous
i
consider
the
modern
love
of
prying
and
probing
into
other
people
affairs
a
most
degrading
and
abominable
sign
of
the
times
it
is
morbid
unwholesome
and
utterly
contemptible
moreover
i
think
that
writers
who
consent
to
be
condemn
themselves
as
literary
charlatans
unworthy
of
the
profession
they
have
wrongfully
adopted
you
see
i
have
the
courage
of
my
opinions
on
this
matter
in
fact
i
believe
if
every
one
were
to
speak
their
honest
mind
openly
a
better
state
of
things
might
be
the
result
and
would
gradually
come
to
be
considered
in
its
true
light
namely
as
a
vulgar
and
illegitimate
method
of
advertisement
i
mean
no
disrespect
to
you
madam
this
as
the
lady
suddenly
put
down
her
veil
thrust
her
in
her
pocket
and
rose
somewhat
bouncingly
from
her
chair
i
am
only
sorry
you
should
find
such
an
occupation
as
that
of
the
open
to
you
i
can
scarcely
imagine
such
work
to
be
congenial
to
a
lady
feelings
as
in
the
case
of
really
distinguished
personages
she
must
assuredly
meet
with
many
a
rebuff
i
hope
i
have
not
offended
you
by
my
bluntness
here
he
trailed
off
into
inaudible
polite
murmurs
while
the
marched
steadily
toward
the
door
oh
dear
no
i
am
not
in
the
least
offended
she
retorted
contemptuously
on
the
contrary
this
has
been
a
most
amusing
experience
most
amusing
i
assure
you
and
quite
unique
why
and
suddenly
stopping
short
she
turned
smartly
round
and
gesticulated
with
one
hand
i
have
interviewed
all
the
favorite
actors
and
actresses
in
london
the
biggest
brewers
in
great
britain
have
received
me
at
their
country
mansions
and
have
given
me
all
the
particulars
of
their
lives
from
earliest
childhood
the
author
of
mugger
took
the
greatest
pains
to
explain
to
me
how
he
first
collected
the
materials
for
his
design
the
author
of
that
most
popular
story
twins
gave
me
a
description
of
all
the
houses
he
has
ever
lived
in
he
even
told
me
where
he
purchased
his
pens
and
ink
and
to
think
that
a
poet
should
be
too
grand
to
be
interrogated
oh
the
idea
is
really
very
funny
quite
too
funny
for
anything
she
gave
a
short
laugh
then
relapsing
into
severity
she
added
you
will
i
hope
tell
alwyn
i
called
villiers
bowed
assuredly
thank
you
because
it
is
possible
he
may
have
different
opinions
to
yours
in
that
case
if
he
writes
me
a
line
fixing
an
appointment
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
call
again
i
will
leave
my
card
and
if
alwyn
is
a
sensible
man
he
will
certainly
hold
broader
ideas
on
the
subject
of
than
you
appear
to
entertain
you
are
quite
sure
i
can
not
see
him
quite
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
firm
emphasis
of
this
reply
oh
very
well
here
she
opened
the
door
rattling
the
handle
with
rather
an
unnecessary
violence
i
sorry
to
have
taken
up
any
of
your
time
villiers
returned
villiers
calmly
touching
the
bell
that
his
servant
might
be
in
readiness
to
show
her
out
but
the
baffled
was
not
altogether
gone
she
looked
back
her
face
wrinkling
into
one
of
those
strangely
unbecoming
expressions
of
grim
playfulness
i
half
a
mind
to
make
an
home
out
of
you
she
said
nodding
at
him
energetically
only
you
not
important
enough
villiers
burst
out
laughing
he
was
not
proof
against
this
touch
of
humor
and
on
a
sudden
impulse
sprang
to
the
door
and
shook
hands
with
her
no
indeed
i
am
not
he
said
with
a
charming
smile
think
of
it
i
have
even
invented
a
new
biscuit
come
let
me
see
you
into
the
hall
i
really
sorry
if
i
spoken
roughly
but
i
assure
you
alwyn
not
at
all
the
sort
of
man
you
want
for
interviewing
he
far
too
modest
and
believe
me
i
not
romancing
a
bit
i
in
earnest
there
are
some
few
fine
manly
gifted
fellows
left
in
the
world
who
do
their
work
for
the
love
of
the
work
alone
and
not
for
the
sake
of
notoriety
and
he
is
one
of
them
now
i
not
certain
if
you
were
quite
candid
with
me
you
admit
that
you
yourself
do
think
much
of
the
people
who
actually
like
to
be
interviewed
his
amiable
glance
his
kindly
manner
took
the
gaunt
female
by
surprise
and
threw
her
quite
off
her
guard
she
laughed
a
natural
unforced
laugh
in
which
there
was
not
a
trace
of
bitterness
he
was
really
a
delightful
young
man
she
thought
in
spite
of
his
notions
well
perhaps
i
do
she
replied
frankly
but
you
see
it
is
not
my
business
to
think
about
them
at
all
i
simply
them
and
i
generally
find
they
are
very
willing
and
often
eager
to
tell
me
all
about
themselves
even
to
quite
trifling
and
unnecessary
details
and
of
course
each
one
thinks
himself
or
herself
the
only
or
the
chief
in
london
or
for
that
matter
in
the
world
i
have
always
to
tone
down
the
egotistical
part
of
it
a
little
especially
with
authors
for
if
i
were
to
write
out
exactly
what
they
separately
say
of
their
contemporaries
it
would
be
simply
frightful
they
would
be
all
at
daggers
drawn
in
no
time
i
assure
you
is
often
a
most
delicate
and
difficult
business
would
it
were
altogether
impossible
said
villiers
heartily
but
as
long
as
there
is
a
plethora
of
little
authors
and
a
scarcity
of
great
ones
so
long
i
suppose
must
it
continue
for
little
men
love
notoriety
and
great
ones
shrink
from
it
just
in
the
same
way
that
good
women
like
flattery
while
bad
ones
court
it
i
hope
you
bear
me
any
grudge
because
i
consider
my
friend
alwyn
both
good
and
great
and
resent
the
idea
of
his
being
placed
no
matter
with
what
excellent
intention
soever
on
the
level
of
the
small
and
mean
the
lady
surveyed
him
with
a
twinkle
of
latent
approval
in
her
eyes
not
in
the
least
she
replied
in
a
tone
of
perfect
on
the
contrary
i
rather
admire
your
frankness
still
i
think
that
as
matters
stand
nowadays
you
are
very
odd
and
i
suppose
your
friend
is
odd
too
but
of
course
there
must
be
exceptions
to
every
rule
at
the
same
time
you
should
recollect
that
in
many
people
opinion
to
be
is
one
of
the
chiefest
rewards
of
fame
villiers
shrugged
his
shoulders
expressively
oh
yes
it
seems
a
poor
reward
to
you
no
doubt
she
continued
smilingly
but
there
are
no
end
of
authors
who
would
do
anything
to
secure
the
notoriety
of
it
now
suppose
that
after
all
alwyn
does
care
to
submit
to
the
operation
you
will
let
me
know
wo
you
certainly
i
will
and
villiers
accepting
her
card
on
which
was
inscribed
her
own
private
name
and
address
shook
hands
once
more
and
bowed
her
courteously
out
no
sooner
had
the
door
closed
upon
her
than
he
sprang
upstairs
three
steps
at
a
time
and
broke
impetuously
in
upon
alwyn
who
seated
at
a
table
covered
with
papers
looked
up
with
a
surprised
smile
at
the
abrupt
fashion
of
his
entrance
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
disburdened
himself
of
the
whole
story
of
the
visit
telling
it
in
a
whimsical
way
of
his
own
much
to
the
amusement
of
his
friend
who
listened
pen
in
hand
with
a
light
in
his
fine
poetic
eyes
now
did
i
express
the
proper
opinion
he
demanded
in
conclusion
was
i
not
right
in
thinking
you
would
never
consent
to
be
interviewed
right
why
of
course
you
were
responded
alwyn
quickly
can
you
imagine
me
calmly
stating
the
details
of
my
personal
life
and
history
to
a
strange
woman
and
allowing
her
to
turn
it
into
a
article
for
some
society
journal
but
villiers
what
an
extraordinary
state
of
things
we
are
coming
to
if
the
press
can
actually
condescend
to
employ
a
sort
of
spy
or
literary
detective
to
inquire
into
the
private
experience
of
each
man
or
woman
who
comes
honorably
to
the
front
honorably
or
dishonorably
it
does
matter
which
said
villiers
that
is
just
the
worst
of
it
one
day
it
is
an
author
who
is
the
next
it
is
a
murderer
now
a
statesman
then
a
ballet
dancer
the
same
honor
is
paid
to
all
who
have
won
any
distinct
notoriety
and
what
is
so
absurd
is
that
the
reading
million
seem
able
to
distinguish
between
and
the
two
things
are
so
widely
utterly
apart
byron
reputation
for
instance
was
much
more
notoriety
during
his
life
than
fame
while
keats
had
actually
laid
hold
on
fame
while
as
yet
deeming
himself
unfamous
it
curious
but
true
nevertheless
that
very
often
the
writers
who
thought
least
of
themselves
during
their
lifetime
have
become
the
most
universally
renowned
after
their
deaths
shakespeare
i
dare
say
had
no
very
exaggerated
idea
of
the
beauty
of
his
own
plays
he
seems
to
have
written
just
the
best
that
was
in
him
without
caring
what
anybody
thought
of
it
and
i
believe
that
is
the
only
way
to
succeed
in
the
end
in
the
end
repeated
alwyn
dreamily
in
the
end
no
worldly
success
is
worth
attaining
a
few
thousand
years
and
the
greatest
are
forgotten
not
the
greatest
said
villiers
warmly
the
greatest
must
always
be
remembered
no
my
friend
not
even
the
greatest
do
you
not
think
there
must
have
been
great
and
wise
and
gifted
men
in
tyre
in
sidon
in
carthage
in
babylon
there
are
five
men
mentioned
in
scripture
as
being
to
write
swiftly
sarea
dabria
selemia
ecanus
and
ariel
where
is
the
no
doubt
admirable
work
done
by
these
perhaps
who
knows
one
of
them
was
as
great
as
homer
in
genius
we
can
not
tell
true
we
can
not
tell
responded
villiers
meditatively
but
alwyn
if
you
persist
in
viewing
things
through
such
tremendous
vistas
of
time
and
in
measuring
the
future
by
the
past
then
one
may
ask
what
is
the
use
of
anything
there
is
no
use
in
anything
except
in
the
making
of
a
strong
persistent
steady
effort
after
good
said
alwyn
earnestly
we
men
are
cast
as
it
were
between
two
swift
currents
wrong
and
right
self
and
god
and
it
seems
more
easy
to
shut
our
eyes
and
drift
into
self
and
wrong
than
to
strike
out
brave
arms
and
swim
despite
all
difficulty
toward
god
and
right
yet
if
we
once
take
the
latter
course
we
shall
find
it
the
most
natural
and
the
least
fatiguing
and
with
every
separate
stroke
of
high
endeavor
we
carry
others
with
us
we
raise
our
race
we
bear
it
onward
upward
and
the
true
reward
or
best
result
of
fame
is
that
having
succeeded
in
winning
brief
attention
from
the
multitude
a
man
may
be
able
to
pronounce
one
of
god
lightning
messages
of
inspired
truth
plainly
to
them
while
they
are
yet
willing
to
stand
and
listen
this
momentary
hearing
from
the
people
is
as
i
take
it
the
sole
reward
any
writer
can
dare
to
hope
for
and
when
he
obtains
it
he
should
remember
that
his
audience
remains
with
him
but
a
very
short
while
so
that
it
is
his
duty
to
see
that
he
employ
his
chance
well
not
to
win
applause
for
himself
but
to
cheer
and
lift
others
to
noble
thought
and
still
more
noble
fulfilment
villiers
regarded
him
wistfully
alwyn
my
dear
fellow
do
you
want
to
be
the
sisyphus
of
this
era
you
will
find
the
stone
of
evil
heavy
to
roll
upward
moreover
it
will
exhibit
the
usually
painful
tendency
to
slip
back
and
crush
you
how
can
it
crush
me
asked
his
friend
with
a
serene
smile
my
heart
can
not
be
broken
or
my
spirit
dismayed
and
as
for
my
body
it
can
but
die
and
death
comes
to
every
man
i
would
rather
try
to
roll
up
the
stone
however
fruitless
the
task
than
sit
idly
looking
at
it
and
doing
nothing
your
heart
can
not
be
broken
ah
how
do
you
know
and
villiers
shook
his
head
dubiously
what
man
can
be
certain
of
his
own
destiny
everyman
can
will
his
own
destiny
returned
alwyn
firmly
that
is
just
it
but
here
we
are
getting
into
a
serious
discussion
and
i
had
determined
to
talk
no
more
on
such
subjects
till
and
we
are
to
go
in
for
them
thoroughly
i
suppose
inquired
villiers
with
a
quick
look
my
dear
boy
you
will
have
to
decide
whether
you
consider
me
mad
or
sane
said
alwyn
cheerfully
i
shall
tell
you
truths
that
seem
like
romances
and
facts
that
sound
like
fables
moreover
i
shall
have
to
assure
you
that
miracles
do
happen
whenever
god
chooses
in
spite
of
all
human
denial
of
their
possibility
do
you
remember
whately
clever
skit
doubts
of
napoleon
i
showing
how
easy
it
was
to
logically
prove
that
napoleon
never
existed
that
ought
to
enlighten
people
as
to
the
very
precise
and
convincing
manner
in
which
we
can
if
we
choose
argue
away
what
is
nevertheless
an
incontestible
fact
thus
do
skeptics
deny
miracles
yet
we
live
surrounded
by
miracles
do
you
think
me
crazed
for
saying
so
villiers
laughed
crazed
no
indeed
i
wish
every
man
in
london
were
as
sane
and
sound
as
you
are
ah
but
wait
till
and
alwyn
eyes
sparkled
mirthfully
perhaps
you
will
alter
your
opinion
then
here
collecting
his
scattered
manuscripts
he
put
them
by
i
done
work
for
the
present
he
said
shall
we
go
for
a
walk
somewhere
villiers
assented
and
they
left
the
room
together
chapter
xxxv
one
against
many
the
beautiful
and
socially
popular
duchess
de
la
santoisie
sat
her
at
brilliantly
appointed
and
flashed
her
bright
eyes
comprehensively
round
the
board
her
party
was
complete
she
had
secured
twenty
of
the
men
and
women
of
letters
in
all
london
and
yet
she
was
not
quite
satisfied
with
the
result
attained
one
dark
splendid
face
on
her
right
hand
had
taken
the
lustre
out
of
all
the
rest
one
quiet
courteous
smile
on
a
mouth
haughty
yet
sweet
had
somehow
or
other
made
the
entertainment
of
little
worth
in
her
own
estimation
she
was
very
fair
to
look
upon
very
witty
very
but
for
once
her
beauty
seemed
to
herself
defective
and
powerless
to
charm
while
the
graceful
cloak
of
social
hypocrisy
she
was
always
accustomed
to
wear
would
not
adapt
itself
to
her
manner
tonight
so
well
as
usual
the
author
of
nourhalma
the
successful
poet
whose
acquaintance
she
had
very
eagerly
sought
to
make
was
not
at
all
the
kind
of
man
she
had
expected
and
now
when
he
was
beside
her
as
her
guest
she
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
him
she
had
met
plenty
of
poets
so
called
before
and
had
for
the
most
part
found
them
insignificant
looking
men
with
an
enormous
opinion
of
themselves
and
a
suave
condescending
contempt
for
all
others
of
their
craft
but
this
being
this
stately
kingly
creature
with
the
noble
head
and
luminous
eyes
this
man
whose
every
gesture
was
graceful
whose
demeanor
was
more
royal
than
that
of
many
a
crowned
monarch
whose
voice
had
such
a
singular
soft
thrill
of
music
in
its
tone
he
was
a
personage
for
whom
she
had
not
been
prepared
and
in
whose
presence
she
felt
curiously
embarrassed
and
almost
ill
at
ease
and
she
was
not
the
only
one
present
who
experienced
these
odd
sensations
alwyn
appearance
when
with
his
friend
villiers
he
had
first
entered
the
duchess
that
evening
and
had
there
been
introduced
to
his
hostess
had
been
a
sort
of
revelation
to
the
languid
fashionable
guests
assembled
sudden
quick
whispers
were
exchanged
surprised
glances
how
unlike
he
was
to
the
general
type
of
the
nervous
fagged
dyspeptic
literary
man
and
now
that
every
one
was
seated
at
dinner
the
same
impression
remained
on
all
an
impression
that
was
to
some
disagreeable
and
humiliating
and
that
yet
could
not
be
got
over
namely
that
this
poet
whom
in
a
way
the
duchess
and
her
friends
had
intended
to
patronize
was
distinctly
superior
to
them
all
nature
as
though
proud
of
her
handiwork
proclaimed
him
as
such
while
he
quite
unconscious
of
the
effect
he
produced
wondered
why
this
bevy
of
human
beings
most
of
whom
were
more
or
less
distinguished
in
the
world
of
art
and
literature
had
so
little
to
say
for
themselves
their
conversation
was
banal
tame
ordinary
they
might
have
been
elegantly
dressed
peasants
for
aught
they
said
of
wise
cheerful
or
witty
the
weather
the
parks
the
theatres
the
newest
actress
and
the
newest
remedies
for
indigestion
these
sort
of
subjects
were
bandied
about
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
vaguely
tame
persistence
that
was
really
irritating
the
question
of
remedies
for
indigestion
seemed
to
hold
ground
longest
owing
to
the
variety
of
opinions
expressed
thereon
the
duchess
grew
more
and
more
inwardly
vexed
and
her
little
foot
beat
an
impatient
tattoo
under
the
table
as
she
replied
with
careless
brevity
to
a
few
of
the
commonplace
observations
addressed
to
her
and
cast
an
occasional
annoyed
glance
at
her
lord
m
le
duc
a
thin
individual
with
a
well
waxed
and
pointed
mustache
whose
countenance
suggested
an
admirably
executed
mask
it
was
a
face
that
said
absolutely
nothing
yet
beneath
its
cold
impassiveness
linked
the
complex
half
civilized
half
brutish
mind
of
the
born
and
bred
parisian
the
with
whom
pure
virtues
whether
in
man
or
woman
are
no
more
sacred
than
nuts
to
a
monkey
the
suave
charm
of
a
polished
civility
sat
on
m
le
due
smooth
brow
and
beamed
in
his
urbane
smile
his
manners
were
exquisite
his
courtesy
irreproachable
his
whole
demeanor
that
of
a
very
precise
and
elegant
master
of
deportment
yet
notwithstanding
his
calm
and
perfectly
exterior
he
was
oddly
enough
the
frequent
prey
of
certain
extraordinary
and
ungovernable
passions
there
were
times
when
he
became
impossible
to
himself
and
when
to
escape
from
his
own
horrible
thoughts
he
would
plunge
headlong
into
an
orgie
of
wild
riot
and
debauchery
such
as
might
have
made
the
hair
of
his
respectable
english
acquaintances
stand
on
end
had
they
known
to
what
an
extent
he
carried
his
excesses
but
at
these
seasons
of
moral
attack
he
went
abroad
for
his
health
as
he
said
delicately
touching
his
chest
in
order
to
suggest
some
interesting
latent
weakness
there
and
in
these
migratory
excursions
his
wife
never
accompanied
him
nor
did
she
complain
of
his
absence
when
he
returned
after
two
or
three
months
he
looked
more
the
chevalier
sans
peur
et
sans
reproche
than
ever
and
neither
he
nor
the
fair
partner
of
his
joys
and
sorrows
even
committed
such
a
breach
of
politeness
as
to
inquire
into
each
other
doings
during
the
time
of
their
separation
so
they
jogged
on
together
presenting
the
most
delightful
outward
show
of
wedded
harmony
to
the
world
and
only
a
few
were
found
to
hazard
the
remark
that
the
racy
novels
madame
la
duchesse
wrote
to
wile
away
her
duller
hours
were
singularly
bitter
in
tone
for
a
woman
whose
lot
in
life
was
so
extremely
enviable
on
this
particular
evening
the
duke
affected
to
be
utterly
unconscious
of
the
meaning
looks
his
beautiful
spouse
shot
at
him
every
now
and
then
looks
which
plainly
said
why
do
you
start
some
interesting
subject
of
conversation
and
stop
these
people
from
talking
such
twaddle
he
was
a
clever
man
in
his
way
and
his
present
mood
was
malign
and
mischievous
therefore
he
went
on
eating
daintily
and
discussing
mild
platitudes
in
the
most
languidly
amiable
manner
imaginable
enjoying
to
the
full
the
mental
confusion
and
discomfort
of
his
guests
confusion
and
discomfort
which
as
he
very
well
knew
was
the
psychological
result
of
their
having
one
in
their
midst
whose
life
and
character
were
totally
opposite
to
and
distinctly
separate
from
their
own
as
emerson
truly
says
let
the
world
beware
when
a
thinker
comes
into
it
and
here
was
this
thinker
this
type
of
the
godlike
in
man
this
uncomfortably
sincere
personage
whose
eyes
were
clear
of
falsehood
whose
genius
was
incontestable
whose
fame
had
taken
society
by
assault
and
who
therefore
was
entitled
to
receive
every
attention
and
consideration
everybody
had
desired
to
see
him
and
here
he
was
the
great
man
the
new
celebrity
and
now
that
he
was
actually
present
no
one
knew
what
to
say
to
him
moreover
there
was
a
very
general
tendency
in
the
company
to
avoid
his
direct
gaze
people
fidgeted
on
their
chairs
and
looked
aside
or
downward
whenever
his
glance
accidentally
fell
on
them
and
to
the
analytical
voltairean
mind
of
le
duc
there
was
something
grimly
humorous
in
the
whole
situation
he
was
a
great
admirer
of
physical
strength
and
beauty
and
alwyn
noble
face
and
fine
figure
had
won
his
respect
though
of
the
genius
of
the
poet
he
knew
nothing
and
cared
less
it
was
enough
for
all
the
purposes
of
social
usage
that
the
author
of
nourhalma
was
considered
illustrious
no
matter
whether
he
deserved
the
appellation
or
not
and
so
the
duke
satirically
amused
at
the
obvious
embarrassment
of
the
other
notabilities
assembled
did
nothing
whatsoever
to
relieve
or
to
lighten
the
conversation
which
remained
so
utterly
dull
and
inane
that
alwyn
who
had
been
compelled
for
politeness
sake
to
appear
interested
in
the
account
of
a
bicycle
race
detailed
to
him
by
a
very
masculine
looking
whose
seat
at
table
was
next
his
own
began
to
feel
a
little
weary
and
to
wonder
dismally
how
long
this
feast
of
reason
and
flow
of
soul
was
going
to
last
villiers
too
whose
easy
and
clever
talk
generally
gave
some
sparkle
and
animation
to
the
dreariest
social
gathering
was
unusually
taciturn
he
was
bored
by
his
partner
a
woman
with
a
mania
for
philology
and
moreover
his
thoughts
like
those
of
most
of
the
persons
present
were
centered
on
alwyn
whom
every
now
and
then
he
regarded
with
a
certain
wistful
wonder
and
reverence
he
had
heard
the
whole
story
of
the
field
of
ardath
and
he
knew
not
how
much
to
accept
of
it
as
true
or
how
much
to
set
down
to
his
friend
ardent
imagination
he
had
come
to
a
fairly
logical
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
namely
that
as
the
city
of
had
been
proved
a
dream
so
surely
the
visit
of
the
edris
must
have
been
a
dream
likewise
that
the
trance
at
the
monastery
of
dariel
followed
by
the
constant
reading
of
the
passages
from
esdras
and
the
treatise
of
algazzali
had
produced
a
vivid
impression
on
alwyn
susceptible
brain
which
had
resolved
itself
into
the
visionary
result
narrated
he
found
in
this
the
most
practical
and
probable
view
of
what
must
otherwise
be
deemed
by
mortal
minds
incredible
and
being
a
frank
and
honest
fellow
he
had
not
scrupled
to
openly
tell
his
friend
what
he
thought
alwyn
had
received
his
remarks
with
the
most
perfect
sweetness
and
equanimity
but
all
the
same
had
remained
unchanged
in
his
opinion
as
to
the
reality
of
his
betrothal
to
his
in
heaven
and
one
or
two
points
had
certainly
baffled
villiers
and
perplexed
him
in
his
precise
analysis
of
the
circumstances
first
there
was
the
remarkable
change
in
alwyn
own
nature
from
an
embittered
sarcastic
disappointed
violently
ambitious
man
he
had
become
softened
gracious
kindly
showing
the
greatest
tenderness
and
forethought
for
others
even
in
small
trifles
while
for
himself
he
took
no
care
he
wore
his
fame
as
lightly
as
a
child
might
wear
a
flower
just
plucked
and
soon
to
fade
his
intelligence
seemed
to
expand
itself
into
a
broad
loving
sympathetic
comprehension
of
the
wants
and
afflictions
of
and
he
was
writing
a
new
poem
of
which
villiers
had
seen
some
lines
that
had
fairly
amazed
him
by
their
grandeur
of
conception
and
clear
passion
of
utterance
thus
it
was
evident
there
was
no
morbidness
in
him
no
obscurity
nothing
eccentric
nothing
that
removed
him
in
any
way
from
his
fellows
except
that
royal
personality
of
his
that
strong
beautiful
spirit
in
him
which
exercised
such
a
bewildering
spell
on
all
who
came
within
its
influence
he
believed
himself
loved
by
an
angel
well
if
there
were
angels
why
not
villiers
argued
the
proposition
thus
whether
we
are
christians
jews
buddhists
or
mahometans
we
are
supposed
to
accept
angels
as
forming
part
of
the
system
of
our
faith
if
we
are
nothing
then
of
course
we
believe
in
nothing
but
granted
we
are
something
then
we
are
bound
in
honor
if
consistent
to
acknowledge
that
angels
help
to
guide
our
destinies
and
if
as
we
are
assured
by
holy
writ
such
loftier
beings
do
exist
why
should
they
not
communicate
with
and
even
love
human
creatures
provided
those
human
creatures
are
worthy
of
their
tenderness
certainly
viewed
by
all
the
chief
religions
of
the
world
there
is
nothing
new
or
outrageous
in
the
idea
of
an
angel
descending
to
the
help
of
man
such
thoughts
as
these
were
in
his
mind
now
as
he
ever
and
anon
glanced
across
the
glittering
table
with
its
profusion
of
lights
and
flowers
to
where
his
sat
slightly
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
a
certain
expression
on
his
handsome
features
though
his
eyes
brightened
into
a
smile
as
he
caught
villiers
look
and
he
gave
the
smallest
scarcely
perceptible
shrug
as
who
should
say
is
this
your
brilliant
duchess
your
witty
and
cultured
society
villiers
flashed
back
an
amused
responsive
glance
and
then
conscientiously
strove
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
irrepressible
feminine
philologist
beside
him
determining
to
take
her
as
he
said
to
himself
by
way
of
penance
for
his
unremembered
sins
after
a
while
there
came
one
of
those
extraordinary
sudden
rushes
of
gabble
that
often
occur
at
even
the
stiffest
a
galloping
race
of
tongues
in
which
nothing
really
distinct
is
heard
but
in
which
each
talks
to
the
other
as
though
moved
by
an
impulse
of
sheer
desperation
this
burst
of
noise
was
a
relief
after
the
strained
murmurs
of
trite
commonplaces
that
had
hitherto
been
the
order
of
the
hour
and
the
fair
duchess
somewhat
easier
in
her
mind
turned
anew
to
alwyn
with
greater
grace
and
gentleness
of
manner
than
she
had
yet
shown
i
am
afraid
she
said
smilingly
you
must
find
us
all
very
stupid
after
your
travels
abroad
in
england
we
are
dull
our
tristesse
can
not
be
denied
but
really
the
climate
is
responsible
we
want
more
sunshine
i
suppose
in
the
east
where
the
sun
is
so
warm
and
bright
the
people
are
always
cheerful
on
the
contrary
i
have
found
them
rather
serious
and
contemplative
than
otherwise
returned
alwyn
yet
their
gravity
is
certainly
of
a
pleasant
and
not
of
a
forbidding
type
i
do
myself
think
the
sun
has
much
to
do
with
the
disposition
of
man
after
all
i
fancy
his
temperament
is
chiefly
moulded
by
the
life
he
leads
in
the
east
for
instance
men
accept
their
existence
as
a
sort
of
divine
command
which
they
obey
cheerfully
yet
with
a
consciousness
of
high
responsibility
on
the
continent
they
take
it
as
a
bagatelle
lightly
won
lightly
lost
hence
their
indifferent
almost
childish
gayety
but
in
great
britain
and
he
smiled
it
looks
nowadays
as
if
it
were
viewed
very
generally
as
a
personal
injury
and
bore
a
kind
of
title
bestowed
without
the
necessary
money
to
keep
it
up
and
this
money
people
set
themselves
steadily
to
obtain
with
many
a
weary
grunt
and
groan
while
they
are
for
the
most
part
forgetful
of
anything
else
life
may
have
to
offer
but
what
is
life
without
plenty
of
money
inquired
the
duchess
carelessly
surely
not
worth
the
trouble
of
living
alwyn
looked
at
her
steadily
and
a
swift
flush
colored
her
smooth
cheek
she
toyed
with
the
magnificent
diamond
spray
at
her
breast
and
wondered
what
strange
spell
was
in
this
man
brilliant
eyes
did
he
guess
that
she
even
she
had
sold
herself
to
the
duc
de
la
santoisie
for
the
sake
of
his
money
and
title
as
easily
and
unresistingly
as
though
she
were
a
mere
purchasable
animal
that
is
an
argument
i
would
rather
not
enter
into
he
said
gently
it
would
lead
us
too
far
but
i
am
convinced
that
whether
dire
poverty
or
great
riches
be
our
portion
life
considered
apart
from
its
worldly
appendages
is
always
worth
living
if
lived
well
pray
how
can
you
separate
life
from
its
worldly
appendages
inquired
a
gentleman
opposite
life
is
the
world
and
the
things
of
the
world
when
we
lose
sight
of
the
world
we
lose
ourselves
in
short
we
die
and
the
world
is
at
an
end
and
we
with
it
that
plain
practical
philosophy
possibly
it
may
be
called
philosophy
returned
alwyn
it
is
not
christianity
oh
christianity
and
the
gentleman
gave
a
portentous
sniff
of
contempt
that
is
a
system
of
faith
that
is
rapidly
dying
out
fast
falling
into
contempt
in
fact
with
the
scientific
and
cultured
classes
it
is
already
an
exploded
doctrine
indeed
alwyn
glance
swept
over
him
with
a
faint
cold
scorn
and
what
religion
do
the
scientific
and
cultured
classes
propose
to
invent
as
a
substitute
there
no
necessity
for
any
substitute
said
the
gentleman
rather
for
those
who
want
to
believe
in
something
supernatural
there
are
plenty
of
different
ideas
afloat
esoteric
buddhism
for
example
and
what
is
called
scientific
religion
and
natural
religion
any
or
all
of
these
are
sufficient
to
gratify
the
imaginative
cravings
of
the
majority
till
they
have
been
educated
out
of
imagination
altogether
but
for
advanced
thinkers
religion
is
really
not
required
at
all
footnote
the
world
is
indebted
to
andrew
lang
for
the
newest
logical
explanation
of
the
religious
instinct
in
man
namely
that
the
very
idea
of
god
first
arose
from
the
terror
and
amazement
of
an
ape
at
the
sound
of
the
thunder
so
choice
and
a
definition
of
deity
needs
no
comment
nay
i
think
we
must
worship
something
retorted
alwyn
a
fine
satire
in
his
rich
voice
if
it
be
only
self
self
is
an
excellent
deity
accommodating
and
always
ready
to
excuse
sin
why
should
we
not
build
temples
raise
altars
and
institute
services
to
the
glory
and
honor
of
self
perhaps
the
time
is
ripe
for
a
public
proclamation
of
this
creed
it
will
be
easily
propagated
for
the
beginnings
of
it
are
in
the
heart
of
every
man
and
need
very
little
fostering
his
thrilling
tone
together
with
the
calm
persuasiveness
of
his
manner
sent
a
sudden
hush
down
the
table
every
one
turned
eagerly
toward
him
some
amused
some
wondering
some
admiring
while
villiers
felt
his
heart
beating
with
uncomfortable
quickness
he
hated
religious
discussions
and
always
avoided
them
and
now
here
was
alwyn
beginning
one
and
he
the
centre
of
a
company
of
persons
who
were
for
the
most
part
avowed
agnostics
to
whose
opinions
his
must
necessarily
be
in
direct
and
absolute
opposition
at
the
same
time
he
remembered
that
those
who
were
sure
of
their
faith
never
lost
their
temper
about
it
and
as
he
glanced
at
his
friend
perfectly
serene
and
coldly
smiling
countenance
he
saw
there
was
no
danger
of
his
letting
slip
even
for
a
moment
his
admirable
power
of
the
duc
de
la
santoisie
meanwhile
settling
his
mustache
and
gracefully
waving
one
hand
on
which
sparkled
a
large
diamond
ring
bent
forward
a
little
with
a
courteous
deprecatory
gesture
i
think
he
said
in
soft
purring
accents
that
my
friend
mudley
here
he
bowed
toward
the
saturnine
looking
individual
who
had
entered
into
conversation
with
alwyn
takes
a
very
proper
and
indeed
a
very
lofty
view
of
the
whole
question
the
moral
sense
and
he
laid
a
severely
weighty
emphasis
on
these
words
the
moral
sense
of
each
man
if
properly
trained
is
quite
sufficient
to
guide
him
through
existence
without
any
such
weakness
as
reliance
on
a
merely
supposititious
deity
the
duke
french
way
of
speaking
english
was
charming
he
gave
an
expressive
roll
to
his
r
especially
when
he
said
the
moral
sense
that
of
itself
almost
carried
conviction
his
wife
smiled
as
she
heard
him
and
her
smile
was
not
altogether
pleasant
perhaps
she
wondered
by
what
criterion
of
excellence
he
measured
his
own
moral
sense
or
whether
despite
his
education
and
culture
he
had
any
moral
sense
at
all
higher
than
that
of
the
pig
who
eats
to
be
eaten
but
alwyn
spoke
and
she
listened
intently
finding
a
singular
fascination
in
the
soft
and
quiet
modulation
of
his
voice
which
gave
a
vaguely
delicious
suggestion
of
music
underlying
speech
to
guide
people
by
their
moral
sense
alone
he
said
you
must
first
prove
plainly
to
them
that
the
moral
sense
exists
together
with
moral
responsibility
you
will
find
this
difficult
as
the
virtue
implied
is
intangible
unseeable
one
can
not
say
of
it
lo
here
or
lo
there
it
is
as
complicated
and
subtle
as
any
other
of
the
manifestations
of
pure
spirit
then
you
must
decide
on
one
universal
standard
or
reasonable
conception
of
what
is
again
you
are
met
by
a
crowd
of
perplexities
as
every
nation
and
every
tribe
has
a
totally
different
idea
of
the
same
thing
in
some
countries
it
is
to
have
many
wives
in
others
to
drown
female
children
in
others
to
solemnly
roast
one
grandparents
for
dinner
supposing
however
that
you
succeed
with
the
aid
of
all
the
philosophers
teachers
and
scientists
in
drawing
up
a
practical
code
of
morality
do
you
not
think
an
enormous
majority
will
be
found
to
ask
you
by
whose
authority
you
set
forth
this
code
and
by
what
right
you
deem
it
necessary
to
enforce
it
you
may
say
the
authority
of
knowledge
and
by
the
right
of
morality
but
since
you
admit
to
there
being
no
spiritual
or
divine
inspiration
for
your
law
you
will
be
confronted
by
a
legion
of
opponents
who
will
assure
you
and
probably
with
perfect
justice
that
their
idea
of
morality
is
as
good
as
yours
and
their
knowledge
as
excellent
that
your
code
appears
to
them
faulty
in
many
respects
and
that
therefore
they
purpose
making
another
one
more
suited
to
their
liking
thus
out
of
your
one
famous
moral
system
would
spring
thousands
of
others
formed
to
gratify
the
various
tastes
of
different
individuals
precisely
in
the
same
manner
as
sects
have
sprung
out
of
the
wholly
unnecessary
and
foolish
human
arguments
on
christianity
only
that
there
would
lack
the
one
indestructible
pure
selfless
example
that
even
the
most
quarrelsome
bigot
must
inwardly
respect
namely
christ
himself
and
would
remain
exactly
where
it
is
neither
better
nor
worse
for
all
the
trouble
taken
concerning
it
it
needs
something
more
than
the
sense
to
rightly
ennoble
man
it
needs
the
spiritual
sense
the
fostering
of
the
instinctive
immortal
aspiration
of
the
creature
to
make
him
comprehend
the
responsibility
of
his
present
life
as
a
preparation
for
his
higher
and
better
destiny
the
cultured
the
scholarly
the
may
live
well
and
uprightly
by
their
sense
if
they
so
choose
provided
they
have
some
great
ideal
to
measure
themselves
by
but
even
these
without
faith
in
god
may
sometimes
slip
and
fall
into
deeper
depths
of
ruin
than
they
dreamed
of
when
on
those
heights
of
virtue
where
they
fancied
themselves
exempt
from
danger
he
paused
there
was
a
curious
stillness
in
the
room
many
eyes
were
lowered
and
le
duc
composure
was
evidently
not
quite
so
absolute
as
usual
taken
at
its
best
he
continued
the
world
alone
is
certainly
not
worth
fighting
for
we
see
the
fact
exemplified
every
day
in
the
cases
of
those
who
surrounded
by
all
that
a
fair
fortune
can
bestow
upon
them
deliberately
hurl
themselves
out
of
existence
by
their
own
free
will
and
act
indeed
suicide
is
a
very
general
accompaniment
of
agnosticism
and
though
it
may
be
called
madness
is
far
more
often
the
result
of
intellectual
misery
of
course
too
much
learning
breeds
brain
disease
remarked
mudley
sententiously
but
only
in
weak
subjects
and
in
my
opinion
the
weak
are
better
out
of
the
world
we
no
room
for
them
nowadays
you
say
truly
sir
replied
alwyn
we
have
no
room
for
them
and
no
patience
they
show
themselves
feeble
and
forthwith
the
strong
oppress
them
they
can
hope
for
little
comfort
here
and
less
help
it
is
well
therefore
that
some
of
these
should
still
believe
in
god
since
they
can
certainly
pin
no
faith
on
the
justice
of
their
but
i
can
not
agree
with
you
that
much
learning
breeds
brain
disease
provided
the
learning
be
accompanied
by
a
belief
in
the
supreme
wisdom
provided
every
step
of
study
be
taken
upward
toward
that
source
of
all
knowledge
one
can
not
learn
too
much
since
hope
increases
with
discernment
and
on
such
food
the
brain
grows
stronger
healthier
and
more
capable
of
high
effort
but
dispense
with
the
spirit
of
the
whole
and
every
movement
though
it
seem
forward
is
in
truth
backward
study
involves
bewilderment
science
becomes
a
reeling
infinitude
of
atoms
madly
whirling
together
for
no
purpose
save
death
or
at
the
best
incessant
change
in
which
mortal
life
is
counted
as
nothing
and
nature
frowns
at
us
a
vast
question
to
which
there
is
no
answer
an
incomprehensible
force
against
which
wretched
man
gifted
with
all
manner
of
splendid
and
godlike
capacities
battles
forever
and
forever
in
vain
this
is
the
terrible
material
lesson
you
would
have
us
learn
the
lesson
that
maddens
pupil
and
teacher
alike
and
has
not
a
glimmer
of
consolation
to
offer
to
any
living
soul
what
a
howling
wilderness
this
world
would
be
if
given
over
entirely
to
materialism
scarce
a
line
of
division
could
be
drawn
between
men
and
the
brute
beasts
of
the
field
i
consider
though
possibly
i
am
only
one
among
many
of
widely
differing
opinion
that
if
you
take
the
hope
of
an
and
blessedness
away
from
the
weary
perpetually
toiling
million
you
destroy
at
one
wanton
blow
their
best
purest
and
noblest
aspirations
as
for
the
christian
religion
i
can
not
believe
that
so
grand
and
holy
a
symbol
is
perishing
among
us
we
have
a
monarch
whose
title
is
of
the
faith
we
live
in
an
age
of
civilization
which
is
primarily
the
result
of
that
faith
and
if
as
this
gentleman
assures
me
and
he
made
a
slight
courteous
inclination
toward
his
opposite
neighbor
christianity
is
exploded
then
certainly
the
greatness
of
this
hitherto
great
nation
is
exploding
with
it
but
i
do
not
think
that
because
a
few
skeptics
uplift
their
wailing
is
vanity
from
their
desert
of
agnosticism
therefore
the
majority
of
men
and
women
are
turning
renegades
from
the
simplest
most
humane
most
unselfish
creed
that
ever
the
world
has
known
it
may
be
so
but
at
present
i
prefer
to
trust
in
the
higher
spiritual
instincts
of
man
at
his
best
rather
than
accept
the
testimony
of
the
lesser
unbelieving
against
the
greater
many
whose
strength
comfort
patience
and
endurance
if
these
virtues
come
not
from
god
come
not
at
all
his
forcible
incisive
manner
of
speaking
together
with
his
perfect
equanimity
and
concise
clearness
of
argument
had
an
evident
effect
on
those
who
listened
here
was
no
rampant
fanatic
for
particular
forms
of
doctrine
or
pietism
here
was
a
man
who
stated
his
opinions
calmly
frankly
and
with
an
absolute
of
facts
which
could
scarcely
be
denied
a
man
who
firmly
grounded
himself
made
no
attempt
to
force
any
one
belief
but
who
simply
took
a
large
view
of
the
whole
and
saw
as
it
were
in
a
glance
what
the
world
might
become
without
faith
in
a
divine
cause
and
principle
of
creation
and
once
grant
this
divine
cause
and
principle
to
be
actually
existent
then
all
other
divine
and
spiritual
things
become
possible
no
matter
how
impossible
they
seem
to
dull
mortal
comprehension
a
brief
pause
followed
his
words
a
pause
of
vague
embarrassment
the
duchess
was
the
first
to
break
it
you
have
very
noble
ideas
alwyn
she
said
with
a
faint
wavering
smile
but
i
am
afraid
your
conception
of
things
both
human
and
divine
is
too
exalted
and
poetically
imaginative
to
be
applied
to
our
life
we
can
not
close
our
ears
to
the
thunders
of
science
we
can
not
fail
to
perceive
that
we
mortals
are
of
as
small
account
in
the
plan
of
the
universe
as
grains
of
sand
on
the
seashore
it
is
very
sad
that
so
it
should
be
and
yet
so
it
is
and
concerning
christianity
the
poor
system
has
been
so
belabored
of
late
with
hard
blows
that
it
is
almost
a
wonder
it
still
breathes
there
is
no
end
to
the
books
that
have
been
written
disproving
and
denouncing
it
moreover
we
have
had
the
subject
recently
treated
in
a
novel
which
excites
our
sympathies
in
behalf
of
a
clergyman
who
overwhelmed
by
scholarship
finds
he
can
no
longer
believe
in
the
religion
he
is
required
to
teach
and
who
renounces
his
living
in
consequence
the
story
is
in
parts
pathetic
it
has
had
a
large
circulation
and
numbers
of
people
who
never
doubted
their
creed
before
certainly
doubt
it
now
alwyn
shrugged
his
shoulders
faith
uprooted
by
a
novel
he
said
alas
poor
faith
it
could
never
have
been
well
established
at
any
time
to
be
so
easy
of
destruction
no
book
in
the
world
whether
of
fact
or
fiction
could
persuade
me
either
to
or
from
the
consciousness
of
what
my
own
individual
spirit
instinctively
knows
faith
can
not
be
taught
or
forced
neither
if
true
can
it
be
really
destroyed
it
is
a
intuition
immortal
as
god
himself
the
ephemeral
theories
set
forth
in
books
should
not
be
able
to
influence
it
by
so
much
as
a
hair
breadth
truth
is
however
often
conveyed
through
the
medium
of
fiction
observed
mudley
and
the
novel
alluded
to
was
calculated
to
disturb
the
mind
and
arouse
trouble
in
the
heart
of
many
an
ardent
believer
it
was
written
by
a
woman
nay
then
said
alwyn
quickly
with
a
darkening
flash
in
his
eyes
if
women
give
up
faith
let
the
world
prepare
for
strange
disaster
good
women
women
who
pray
women
who
hope
women
who
inspire
men
to
do
the
best
that
is
in
them
these
are
the
safety
and
glory
of
nations
when
women
forget
to
kneel
when
women
cease
to
teach
their
children
the
father
by
whose
grandly
simple
plea
humanity
claims
divinity
as
its
origin
then
shall
we
learn
what
is
meant
by
hearts
failing
them
for
fear
and
for
looking
after
those
things
which
are
coming
on
the
earth
a
woman
who
denies
christ
repudiates
him
who
above
all
others
made
her
sex
as
free
and
honored
as
everywhere
in
christendom
it
is
he
never
refused
woman
prayer
he
had
patience
for
her
weakness
pardon
for
her
sins
and
any
book
written
by
woman
hand
that
does
him
the
smallest
shadow
of
wrong
is
to
me
as
gross
an
act
as
that
of
one
who
loaded
with
benefits
scruples
not
to
murder
his
benefactor
the
duchess
de
la
santoisie
moved
uneasily
there
was
a
vibration
in
alwyn
voice
that
went
to
her
very
heart
strange
thoughts
swept
across
her
mind
again
she
saw
in
fancy
a
little
fair
dead
child
that
she
had
loved
her
only
one
on
whom
she
had
spent
all
the
tenderness
of
which
her
nature
was
capable
it
had
died
at
the
prettiest
age
of
children
the
age
of
lisping
speech
and
softly
tottering
feet
when
a
journey
from
the
protecting
background
of
a
wall
to
outstretched
maternal
arms
seems
fraught
with
dire
peril
to
the
tiny
adventurer
and
is
only
undertaken
with
the
help
of
much
coaxing
sweet
laughter
and
still
sweeter
kisses
she
remembered
how
in
spite
of
her
free
opinions
she
had
found
it
impossible
not
to
teach
her
little
one
a
prayer
and
a
sudden
mist
of
tears
blurred
her
sight
as
she
recollected
the
child
last
words
words
uttered
plaintively
in
the
death
grasp
of
a
cruel
fever
suffer
to
come
to
thee
a
quick
sigh
escaped
her
lips
the
diamonds
on
her
breast
heaved
restlessly
lifting
her
eyes
grown
soft
with
gentle
memory
she
encountered
those
of
alwyn
and
again
she
asked
herself
could
he
read
her
thoughts
his
steadfast
gaze
seemed
to
encompass
her
and
absorb
in
a
grave
compassionate
earnestness
the
entire
comprehension
of
her
life
her
husband
polite
mellifluous
accents
roused
her
from
this
i
confess
i
am
surprised
alwyn
he
was
saying
that
you
a
man
of
such
genius
and
ability
should
be
still
in
the
leading
strings
of
the
church
there
is
no
church
returned
alwyn
quietly
the
world
is
waiting
for
one
the
alpha
beta
of
christianity
has
been
learned
and
recited
more
or
less
badly
by
the
children
of
men
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
the
actual
grammar
and
meaning
of
the
whole
language
has
yet
to
be
deciphered
there
have
been
and
are
what
are
called
churches
one
especially
which
if
it
would
bravely
discard
mere
vulgar
superstition
and
accept
absorb
and
use
the
discoveries
of
science
instead
might
and
possibly
will
blossom
into
the
true
universal
and
pure
christian
fabric
meanwhile
in
the
shaking
to
and
fro
of
things
the
troublous
sifting
of
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
we
must
be
content
to
follow
by
the
way
of
the
cross
as
best
we
can
christianity
has
fallen
into
disrepute
probably
because
of
the
it
demands
for
in
this
age
the
primal
object
of
each
individual
is
manifestly
to
serve
self
only
it
is
a
wrong
road
a
that
leads
nowhere
and
we
shall
inevitably
have
to
turn
back
upon
it
and
recover
the
right
path
if
not
now
why
then
hereafter
his
voice
had
a
tremor
of
pain
within
it
he
was
thinking
of
the
millions
of
men
and
women
who
were
voluntarily
wandering
astray
into
a
darkness
they
did
not
dream
of
and
his
heart
the
great
true
heart
of
the
poet
became
filled
with
an
indescribable
passion
of
yearning
no
wonder
he
mused
no
wonder
that
christ
came
hither
for
the
sake
of
love
to
rescue
to
redeem
to
save
to
bless
o
divine
sympathy
for
sorrow
if
i
a
man
can
feel
such
aching
pity
for
the
woes
of
others
how
vast
how
limitless
how
tender
must
be
the
pity
of
god
and
his
eyes
softened
he
almost
forgot
his
surroundings
he
was
entirely
unaware
of
the
various
deep
and
wistful
emotions
he
had
wakened
in
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
there
was
a
great
attractiveness
in
him
that
he
was
not
conscious
of
and
while
all
present
certainly
felt
that
he
though
among
them
was
not
of
them
they
were
at
the
same
time
curiously
moved
by
an
impression
that
notwithstanding
his
being
as
it
were
set
apart
from
their
ways
of
existence
his
sympathetic
influence
surrounded
them
as
resistlessly
as
a
pure
atmosphere
in
which
they
drew
long
refreshing
breaths
of
healthier
life
i
should
like
suddenly
said
a
bearded
individual
who
was
seated
down
the
table
and
who
had
listened
attentively
to
everything
i
should
like
to
tell
you
a
few
things
about
esoteric
buddhism
i
am
sure
it
is
a
faith
that
would
suit
you
admirably
alwyn
smiled
courteously
enough
i
shall
be
happy
to
hear
your
views
on
the
subject
sir
he
answered
gently
but
i
must
tell
you
that
before
i
left
england
for
the
east
i
had
studied
that
theory
together
with
many
others
that
were
offered
as
substitutes
for
christianity
and
i
found
it
totally
inadequate
to
meet
the
highest
demands
of
the
spiritual
intelligence
i
may
also
add
that
i
have
read
carefully
all
the
principal
works
against
religion
from
the
treatises
of
the
earliest
skeptics
down
to
voltaire
and
others
of
our
own
day
moreover
i
had
not
so
very
long
ago
rejected
the
christian
faith
that
i
now
accept
and
adhere
to
it
is
not
the
result
of
my
merit
or
attainment
but
simply
the
outcome
of
an
undeserved
blessing
and
singularly
happy
fortune
pardon
me
alwyn
said
madame
de
la
santoisie
with
a
sweet
smile
by
all
the
laws
of
nature
i
must
contradict
you
there
your
fame
and
fortune
must
needs
be
the
reward
of
merit
since
true
happiness
never
comes
to
the
undeserving
alwyn
made
no
reply
inasmuch
as
to
repudiate
the
idea
of
personal
merit
too
warmly
is
as
such
matters
are
judged
nowadays
suggestive
of
more
conceit
than
modesty
he
skilfully
changed
the
conversation
and
it
glided
off
by
degrees
into
various
other
channels
music
art
science
and
the
political
situation
of
the
hour
the
men
and
women
assembled
as
though
stimulated
and
inspired
by
some
new
interest
now
strove
to
appear
at
their
very
best
and
the
friction
of
intellect
with
intellect
resulted
in
more
or
less
brilliancy
of
talk
which
for
once
was
totally
free
from
the
flippant
and
mocking
spirit
which
usually
pervaded
the
santoisie
social
circle
on
all
the
subjects
that
came
up
for
discussion
alwyn
proved
himself
thoroughly
at
home
and
le
duc
sitting
in
a
silence
that
was
most
unwonted
with
him
became
filled
with
amazement
to
think
that
this
man
so
full
of
fine
qualities
and
intellectual
abilities
should
be
actually
a
christian
the
thing
was
quite
incongruous
or
seemed
so
to
the
ironical
wit
of
the
born
and
bred
parisian
he
tried
to
consider
it
absurd
even
laughable
but
his
efforts
merely
resulted
in
a
sense
of
uneasy
personal
shame
this
poet
was
at
any
rate
a
man
he
might
have
posed
for
a
coriolanus
or
marc
antony
and
there
was
something
supreme
about
him
that
could
not
be
sneered
down
the
dinner
meanwhile
reached
its
dessert
climax
and
the
duchess
rose
giving
the
customary
departing
signal
to
her
alwyn
hastened
to
open
the
door
for
her
and
she
passed
out
followed
by
a
train
of
women
in
rich
and
rustling
costumes
all
of
whom
as
they
swept
past
the
kingly
figure
that
with
slightly
bent
head
and
courteous
mien
thus
paid
silent
homage
to
their
sex
were
conscious
of
very
unusual
emotions
of
respect
and
reverence
how
would
it
be
some
of
them
thought
if
they
were
more
frequently
brought
into
contact
with
such
royal
and
gracious
manhood
would
not
love
then
become
indeed
a
hallowed
glory
and
marriage
a
true
sacrament
was
it
not
possible
for
men
to
be
the
gods
of
this
world
rather
than
the
devils
they
so
often
are
such
were
a
few
of
the
questions
that
flitted
dimly
through
the
minds
of
the
fair
ones
that
clustered
round
the
duchess
de
la
santoisie
and
eagerly
discussed
alwyn
personal
beauty
and
extraordinary
charm
of
manner
the
gentlemen
did
not
absent
themselves
long
and
with
their
appearance
from
the
the
reception
of
the
evening
began
crowds
of
people
arrived
and
crammed
up
the
stairs
filling
every
corridor
and
corner
and
alwyn
growing
tired
of
the
various
introductions
and
shaking
of
hands
to
which
he
was
submitted
managed
presently
to
slip
away
into
a
conservatory
adjoining
the
great
a
cool
softly
lighted
place
full
of
flowering
azaleas
and
rare
palms
here
he
sat
for
a
while
among
the
red
and
white
blossoms
listening
to
the
incessant
hum
of
voices
and
wondering
what
enjoyment
human
beings
could
find
in
thus
herding
together
en
masse
and
chattering
all
at
once
as
though
life
depended
on
chatter
when
the
rustling
of
a
dress
disturbed
his
brief
solitude
he
rose
directly
as
he
saw
his
fair
hostess
approaching
him
ah
you
have
fled
away
from
us
mr
alwyn
she
said
with
a
slight
smile
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
these
receptions
are
the
bane
of
social
existence
then
why
do
you
give
them
asked
alwyn
half
laughingly
why
oh
because
it
is
the
fashion
i
suppose
she
answered
languidly
leaning
against
a
marble
column
that
supported
the
towering
frondage
of
a
tropical
fern
and
toying
with
her
fan
and
i
like
others
am
a
slave
to
fashion
i
have
escaped
for
one
moment
but
i
must
go
back
directly
alwyn
she
hesitated
then
came
straight
up
to
him
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
i
want
to
thank
you
to
thank
me
he
repeated
in
surprised
accents
yes
she
said
steadily
to
thank
you
for
what
you
have
said
we
live
in
a
dreary
age
when
no
one
has
much
faith
or
hope
and
still
less
charity
death
is
set
before
us
as
the
final
end
of
all
and
life
as
lived
by
most
people
is
not
only
not
worth
living
but
utterly
contemptible
your
clearly
expressed
opinions
have
made
me
think
it
is
possible
to
do
better
her
lips
quivered
a
little
and
her
breath
came
and
went
quickly
and
i
shall
begin
to
try
and
find
out
how
this
can
be
consummated
pray
do
not
think
me
foolish
think
you
foolish
and
with
gravest
courtesy
alwyn
raised
her
hand
and
touched
it
gently
with
his
lips
then
as
gently
released
it
his
action
was
full
of
grace
it
implied
reverence
trust
honor
and
the
duchess
looked
at
him
with
soft
wet
eyes
in
which
a
smile
still
lingered
if
there
were
more
men
like
you
she
said
suddenly
what
a
difference
it
would
make
to
us
women
we
should
be
proud
to
share
the
burdens
of
life
with
those
on
whose
absolute
integrity
and
strength
we
could
rely
but
in
these
days
we
do
not
rely
so
much
as
we
despise
we
can
not
love
so
much
as
we
condemn
you
are
a
poet
and
for
you
the
world
takes
ideal
colors
for
you
perchance
the
very
heavens
have
opened
but
remember
that
the
millions
who
in
the
present
era
are
ground
down
under
the
heels
of
the
grimmest
necessity
have
no
such
glimpses
of
god
as
are
vouchsafed
to
you
they
are
truly
in
the
darkness
and
shadow
of
death
they
hear
no
angel
music
they
sit
in
dungeons
howled
at
by
preachers
and
teachers
who
make
no
actual
attempt
to
lead
them
into
light
and
liberty
while
we
the
classes
are
imprisoned
as
closely
as
they
and
crushed
by
intolerable
weights
of
learning
such
as
many
of
us
are
not
fitted
to
bear
those
who
aspire
heavenwards
are
hurled
to
earth
those
who
of
their
own
choice
cling
to
death
become
so
fastened
to
it
that
even
if
they
wished
they
could
not
rise
believe
me
you
will
be
sorely
disheartened
in
your
efforts
toward
the
highest
good
you
will
find
most
people
callous
careless
ignorant
and
forever
scoffing
at
what
they
do
not
and
will
not
understand
you
had
better
leave
us
to
our
dust
and
ashes
and
a
little
mirthless
laugh
escaped
her
lips
for
to
pluck
us
from
thence
now
will
almost
need
a
second
visitation
of
christ
in
whom
if
he
came
we
should
probably
not
believe
moreover
you
must
not
forget
that
we
have
read
darwin
and
we
are
so
charmed
with
our
monkey
ancestors
that
we
are
doing
our
best
to
imitate
them
in
every
possible
way
in
the
hope
that
with
time
and
patience
we
may
resolve
ourselves
back
into
the
original
species
with
which
bitter
sarcasm
uttered
half
mockingly
half
in
good
earnest
she
left
him
and
returned
to
her
guests
not
very
long
afterward
he
having
sought
and
found
villiers
and
suggested
to
him
that
it
was
time
to
make
a
move
homeward
approached
her
in
company
with
his
friend
and
bade
her
farewell
i
do
think
we
shall
see
you
often
in
society
alwyn
she
said
rather
wistfully
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
you
are
too
much
of
a
titan
among
pigmies
he
flushed
and
waved
aside
the
remark
with
a
few
playful
words
unlike
his
former
self
if
there
was
anything
in
the
world
he
shrank
from
it
was
flattery
or
what
seemed
like
flattery
once
outside
the
house
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
glanced
gratefully
up
at
the
sky
bright
with
the
glistening
multitude
of
stars
thank
god
there
were
worlds
in
that
glorious
expanse
of
ether
peopled
with
loftier
types
of
being
than
what
is
called
humanity

looked
at
him
questioningly
tired
of
your
own
celebrity
alwyn
he
asked
taking
him
by
the
arm
are
the
pleasures
of
fame
already
exhausted
alwyn
smiled
he
thought
of
the
fame
of
laureate
bard
of
nay
if
the
dream
that
i
told
you
of
had
any
meaning
at
all
he
replied
then
i
enjoyed
and
exhausted
those
pleasures
long
ago
perhaps
that
is
the
reason
why
my
seems
such
a
poor
and
tame
circumstance
now
but
i
was
not
thinking
of
myself
i
was
wondering
whether
after
all
the
slight
power
i
have
attained
can
be
of
much
use
to
others
i
am
only
one
against
many
nevertheless
there
is
an
old
maxim
which
says
that
one
hero
makes
a
thousand
said
villiers
quietly
and
it
is
an
undeniable
fact
that
the
vastest
number
ever
counted
begins
at
the
very
beginning
with
one
alwyn
met
his
smiling
earnest
eyes
with
a
quick
responsive
light
in
his
own
and
the
two
friends
walked

chapter
xxxvi
heliobas
some
few
days
after
the
duchess
alwyn
was
strolling
one
morning
through
the
park
enjoying
to
the
full
the
keen
fresh
odors
of
the
spring
odors
that
even
in
london
can
not
altogether
lose
their
sweetness
so
long
as
hyacinths
and
violets
consent
to
bloom
and
to
flower
beneath
the
too
often
unpropitious
murkiness
of
city
skies
it
had
been
raining
but
now
the
clouds
had
rolled
off
and
the
sun
shone
as
brightly
as
it
ever
can
shine
on
the
english
capital
sending
sparkles
of
gold
among
the
still
wet
foliage
and
reviving
the
little
crocuses
that
had
lately
tumbled
down
in
heaps
on
the
grass
like
a
frightened
fairy
army
put
to
rout
by
the
onslaught
of
the
recent
shower
a
blackbird
whose
cheery
note
suggested
melodious
memories
drawn
from
the
heart
of
the
quiet
country
was
whistling
a
lively
improvisation
on
the
bough
of
a
whereof
the
brown
shining
buds
were
just
bursting
into
leaf
and
alwyn
whose
every
sense
was
pleasantly
attuned
to
the
small
as
well
as
great
harmonies
of
nature
paused
for
a
moment
to
listen
to
the
luscious
piping
of
the
feathered
minstrel
that
in
its
own
wild
woodland
way
had
as
excellent
an
idea
of
musical
variation
as
any
mozart
or
chopin
leaning
against
one
of
the
park
benches
with
his
back
turned
to
the
main
thoroughfare
he
did
not
observe
the
approach
of
a
man
tall
stately
figure
that
with
something
of
his
own
light
easy
swinging
step
had
followed
him
rapidly
along
for
some
little
distance
and
that
now
halted
abruptly
within
a
pace
or
two
of
where
he
stood
a
man
whose
fine
face
and
singular
distinction
of
bearing
had
caused
many
a
to
stare
at
him
in
vague
admiration
and
to
wonder
who
such
a
personage
might
possibly
be
alwyn
however
absorbed
in
thought
saw
no
one
and
was
about
to
resume
his
onward
walk
when
suddenly
as
though
moved
by
some
instinctive
impulse
he
turned
sharply
around
and
in
so
doing
confronted
the
stranger
who
straightway
advanced
lifting
his
hat
and
smiling
one
amazed
glance
and
then
with
an
ejaculation
of
wonder
recognition
and
delight
alwyn
sprang
forward
and
grasped
his
extended
hand
heliobas
he
exclaimed
is
it
possible
you
are
in
london
you
of
all
men
in
the
world
even
so
replied
heliobas
gayly
and
why
not
am
i
incongruous
and
out
of
keeping
with
the
march
of
modern
civilization
alwyn
looked
at
him
he
could
hardly
believe
his
own
eyes
it
seemed
such
an
altogether
amazing
thing
to
meet
this
devout
and
grave
chaldean
philosopher
this
mystic
monk
of
the
caucasus
here
in
the
very
centre
as
it
were
of
the
business
traffic
and
pleasure
one
might
as
well
have
expected
to
find
a
haloed
saint
in
the
whirl
of
a
carnival
masquerade
incongruous
out
of
keeping
yes
certainly
he
was
for
though
clad
in
the
plain
conventional
garb
to
which
the
men
of
the
present
day
are
doomed
by
the
fiat
of
commerce
and
custom
the
splendid
dignity
and
picturesqueness
of
his
fine
personal
appearance
was
by
no
means
abated
and
it
was
just
this
that
marked
him
out
and
made
of
him
as
wonderful
a
figure
in
london
as
though
some
god
or
evangelist
should
suddenly
pass
through
a
wilderness
of
chattering
apes
and
screaming
vultures
but
how
and
when
did
you
come
asked
alwyn
presently
recovering
from
his
first
glad
shock
of
surprise
you
see
how
genuine
is
my
astonishment
why
i
thought
you
were
a
perpetually
vowed
recluse
that
you
never
went
into
the
world
at
all
neither
i
do
rejoined
heliobas
save
when
strong
necessity
demands
but
our
order
is
not
so
that
if
duty
calls
we
can
not
advance
to
its
beckoning
and
there
are
certain
times
when
both
i
and
those
of
my
fraternity
mingle
with
men
in
common
undistinguished
from
the
ordinary
inhabitants
of
cities
either
by
dress
customs
or
manners
as
you
see
and
he
laughingly
touched
his
overcoat
the
dark
rough
cloth
of
which
was
relieved
by
a
broad
collar
and
revers
of
rich
sealskin
would
you
not
take
me
for
a
highly
respectable
brewer
par
example
conscious
that
his
prowess
in
the
making
of
beer
has
entitled
him
not
only
to
an
immediate
seat
in
parliament
but
also
to
a
dukedom
in
prospective
alwyn
smiled
at
the
droll
inapplicability
of
this
comparison
and
heliobas
cheerfully
continued
i
am
on
the
wing
just
now
bound
for
mexico
i
had
business
in
london
and
arrived
here
two
days
since
two
days
more
will
see
me
again
en
voyage
i
am
glad
to
have
met
you
thus
by
chance
for
i
did
not
know
your
address
and
though
i
might
have
obtained
that
through
your
publishers
i
hesitated
about
it
not
being
quite
certain
as
to
whether
a
letter
or
visit
from
me
might
be
welcome
surely
began
alwyn
and
then
he
paused
a
flush
rising
to
his
brow
as
he
remembered
how
obstinately
he
had
doubted
and
suspected
this
man
good
faith
and
intention
toward
him
and
how
he
had
even
received
his
farewell
benediction
at
dariel
with
more
resentment
than
gratitude
everywhere
i
hear
great
things
of
you
alwyn
went
on
heliobas
gently
taking
no
notice
of
his
embarrassment
your
fame
is
now
indeed
unquestionable
with
all
my
heart
i
congratulate
you
and
wish
you
long
life
and
health
to
enjoy
the
triumph
of
your
genius
alwyn
smiled
and
turning
fixed
his
clear
soft
eyes
full
on
the
speaker
i
thank
you
he
said
simply
but
you
who
have
such
a
quick
instinctive
comprehension
of
the
minds
and
characters
of
men
judge
for
yourself
whether
i
attach
any
value
to
the
poor
renown
i
have
won
renown
that
i
once
would
have
given
my
very
life
to
possess
as
he
spoke
he
stopped
they
were
walking
down
a
quiet
under
the
wavering
shadow
of
newly
bourgeoning
beeches
and
a
bright
shaft
of
sunshine
struck
through
the
delicate
foliage
straight
on
his
serene
and
handsome
countenance
heliobas
gave
him
a
swift
keen
observant
glance
in
a
moment
he
noticed
what
a
marvellous
change
had
been
wrought
in
the
man
who
but
a
few
months
before
had
come
to
him
a
wreck
of
wasted
life
a
wreck
that
was
not
only
ready
but
willing
to
drift
into
downward
currents
and
whirlpools
of
desperate
godless
blank
and
hopeless
misery
and
now
how
completely
he
was
transformed
health
colored
his
cheeks
and
sparkled
in
his
eyes
health
both
of
body
and
mind
gave
that
quick
brilliancy
to
his
smile
and
that
easy
yet
powerful
poise
to
his
whole
figure
while
the
supreme
consciousness
of
the
immortal
spirit
within
him
surrounded
him
with
the
same
indescribable
fascination
and
magnetic
attractiveness
that
distinguished
heliobas
himself
even
as
it
distinguishes
all
who
have
in
good
earnest
discovered
and
accepted
the
only
true
explanation
of
their
individual
mystery
of
being
one
steady
flashing
look
and
then
heliobas
silently
held
out
his
hand
as
silently
alwyn
clasped
it
and
the
two
men
understood
each
other
all
constraint
was
at
an
end
and
when
they
resumed
their
slow
sauntering
under
the
glistening
green
branches
they
were
mutually
aware
that
they
now
held
an
almost
equal
rank
in
the
hierarchy
of
spiritual
knowledge
strength
and
sympathy
evidently
your
adventure
to
the
ruins
of
babylon
was
not
altogether
without
results
said
heliobas
softly
your
appearance
indicates
happiness
is
your
life
at
last
complete
complete
no
and
alwyn
sighed
somewhat
impatiently
it
can
not
be
complete
so
long
as
its
best
and
purest
half
is
elsewhere
my
fame
is
as
you
can
guess
a
mere
ephemera
a
small
vanishing
point
in
comparison
with
the
higher
ambition
i
have
now
in
view
listen
you
know
nothing
of
what
happened
to
me
on
the
field
of
ardath
i
should
have
written
to
you
perhaps
but
it
is
better
to
speak
i
will
tell
you
all
as
briefly
as
i
can
and
talking
in
an
undertone
with
his
arm
linked
through
that
of
his
companion
he
related
the
whole
strange
story
of
the
visitation
of
edris
the
dream
of
his
awakening
on
the
prophet
field
at
sunrise
and
his
final
renunciation
of
self
at
the
cross
of
christ
heliobas
listened
to
him
in
perfect
silence
his
eyes
alone
expressing
with
what
eager
interest
and
attention
he
followed
every
incident
of
the
narrative
and
now
said
alwyn
in
conclusion
i
always
try
to
remember
for
my
own
comfort
that
i
left
my
dead
self
in
the
burning
ruin
of
that
dream
built
city
of
the
past
or
seemed
to
leave
it
and
yet
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
its
shadow
presence
clung
to
me
still
i
look
in
the
mirror
and
see
strange
faint
reflections
of
the
actual
personal
attributes
of
the
slain
occasionally
these
are
so
strong
and
distinctly
marked
that
i
turn
away
in
anger
from
my
own
image
why
i
loved
that
phantasm
of
a
poet
in
my
dream
as
i
must
for
ages
have
loved
myself
to
my
own
utter
undoing
i
admired
his
work
with
such
extravagant
fondness
that
thinking
of
it
i
blush
for
shame
at
my
own
thus
manifest
conceit
in
truth
there
is
only
one
thing
in
that
pictured
character
of
his
i
can
for
the
present
judge
myself
free
from
namely
the
careless
rejection
of
true
love
for
false
the
wanton
misprisal
of
a
faithful
heart
such
as
niphrata
whose
fair
even
now
often
flits
before
my
remorseful
memory
and
the
evil
sensual
passion
for
a
woman
whose
wickedness
was
as
evident
as
her
beauty
was
paramount
i
could
never
understand
or
explain
this
wilful
headstrong
weakness
in
my
it
was
the
one
circumstance
in
my
vision
that
seemed
to
have
little
to
do
with
the
positive
me
in
its
application
but
now
i
thoroughly
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
lesson
conveyed
which
is
that
no
man
ever
really
knows
himself
or
fathoms
the
depths
of
his
own
possible
inconsistencies
and
as
matters
stand
with
me
at
the
present
time
i
am
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
by
difficulties
for
since
the
modern
success
of
that
very
anciently
composed
poem
and
he
smiled
my
friends
and
acquaintances
are
doing
their
best
to
make
me
think
as
much
of
myself
as
if
i
were
well
all
that
i
am
not
do
what
i
will
i
believe
am
still
an
egoist
nay
i
am
sure
of
it
for
even
as
regards
my
heavenly
saint
edris
i
am
selfish
how
so
asked
heliobas
with
a
grave
of
admiration
at
the
thoughtful
face
and
meditative
earnest
eyes
of
this
poet
this
once
bitter
and
blasphemous
skeptic
grown
up
now
to
a
majesty
of
faith
that
not
all
the
scorn
of
men
or
devils
could
ever
shake
again
i
want
her
he
replied
and
there
was
a
thrill
of
pathetic
yearning
in
his
voice
i
long
for
her
every
moment
of
the
day
and
night
it
seems
too
as
if
everything
combined
to
encourage
this
craving
in
me
this
fond
mad
desire
to
draw
her
down
from
her
own
bright
sphere
of
joy
down
to
my
arms
my
heart
my
life
see
and
he
stopped
by
a
bed
of
white
hyacinths
nodding
softly
in
the
faint
breeze
even
those
flowers
remind
me
of
her
when
i
look
up
at
the
blue
sky
i
think
of
the
radiance
of
her
eyes
they
were
the
heaven
own
color
when
i
see
light
clouds
floating
together
half
gray
half
tinted
by
the
sun
they
seem
to
me
to
resemble
the
soft
and
noiseless
garb
she
wore
the
birds
sing
only
to
recall
to
me
the
sweetness
of
her
voice
and
at
night
when
i
behold
the
millions
upon
millions
of
stars
that
are
worlds
peopled
as
they
must
be
with
thousands
of
wonderful
living
creatures
perhaps
as
spiritually
composed
as
she
i
sometimes
find
it
hard
that
out
of
all
the
exhaustless
types
of
being
that
love
serve
and
praise
god
in
heaven
this
one
fair
spirit
only
this
one
should
not
be
spared
to
help
and
comfort
me
yes
i
am
selfish
to
the
heart
core
my
friend
and
his
eyes
darkened
with
a
vague
wistfulness
and
trouble
moreover
i
have
weakly
striven
to
excuse
my
selfishness
to
my
own
conscience
thus
i
have
thought
that
if
she
were
vouchsafed
to
me
for
the
remainder
of
my
days
i
might
then
indeed
do
lasting
good
and
leave
lasting
consolation
to
the
world
such
work
might
be
performed
as
would
stir
the
most
callous
souls
to
life
and
energy
and
aspiration
with
her
sweet
presence
near
me
visibly
close
and
constant
there
is
no
task
so
difficult
that
i
would
not
essay
and
conquer
in
for
her
sake
her
service
her
greater
glory
but
alone
and
he
gave
a
slight
hopeless
gesture
nay
christ
knows
i
will
do
the
utmost
best
i
can
but
the
solitary
ways
of
life
are
hard
heliobas
regarded
him
fixedly
you
seem
to
be
alone
he
said
presently
after
a
pause
but
truly
you
are
not
so
you
think
you
are
set
apart
to
do
your
work
in
solitude
nevertheless
she
whom
you
love
may
be
near
you
even
while
you
speak
still
i
understand
what
you
mean
you
long
to
see
her
again
to
realize
her
tangible
form
and
presence
well
this
can
not
be
until
you
pass
from
this
earth
and
adopt
her
nature
unless
unless
she
descends
hither
and
adopts
yours
the
last
words
were
uttered
slowly
and
impressively
and
countenance
brightened
with
a
sudden
irresistible
rapture
that
would
be
impossible
he
said
but
his
voice
trembled
and
there
was
more
interrogativeness
than
assertion
in
his
tone
impossible
in
most
cases
yes
agreed
heliobas
but
in
your
specially
chosen
and
privileged
estate
i
can
not
positively
say
that
such
a
thing
might
not
be
for
one
moment
a
strange
eager
brilliancy
shone
in
alwyn
eyes
the
next
he
set
his
lips
hard
and
made
a
firm
gesture
of
denial
do
not
tempt
me
good
heliobas
he
said
with
a
faint
smile
or
rather
do
not
let
me
tempt
myself
i
bear
in
constant
mind
what
she
my
edris
told
me
when
she
left
me
that
we
should
not
meet
again
till
after
death
unless
the
longing
of
my
love
compelled
now
if
it
be
true
as
i
have
often
thought
that
i
could
compel
by
what
right
dare
i
use
such
power
if
power
i
have
upon
her
she
loves
me
i
love
her
and
by
the
force
of
love
such
love
as
ours
who
knows
i
might
perchance
persuade
her
to
adopt
a
while
this
mean
uneasy
vesture
of
mere
mortal
life
and
the
very
innate
perception
that
i
might
do
so
is
the
sharpest
trial
i
have
to
endure
because
if
i
would
thoroughly
conquer
myself
i
must
resist
this
feeling
nay
i
will
resist
it
for
let
it
cost
me
what
it
may
i
have
sworn
that
the
selfishness
of
my
own
personal
desire
shall
never
cross
or
cloud
the
radiance
of
her
perfect
happiness
but
suppose

quietly
suppose
she
were
to
find
an
even
more
complete
happiness
in
making
you
happy
alwyn
shook
his
head
my
friend
do
not
let
us
talk
of
it
he
answered
no
joy
can
be
more
complete
than
the
joy
of
heaven
and
that
in
its
full
blessedness
is
hers
that
in
its
full
blessedness
is
not
hers
declared
heliobas
with
emphasis
and
moreover
it
can
never
be
hers
while
you
are
still
an
exile
and
a
wanderer
friend
poet
do
you
think
that
even
heaven
is
wholly
happy
to
one
who
loves
and
whose
beloved
is
absent
a
tremor
shook
alwyn
nerves
his
eyes
glowed
as
though
the
inward
fire
of
his
soul
had
lightened
them
but
his
face
grew
very
pale
no
more
of
this
for
god
sake
he
said
passionately
i
must
not
dream
of
it
i
dare
not
i
become
the
slave
of
my
own
imagined
rapture
the
coward
who
falls
conquered
and
trembling
before
his
own
desire
of
delight
rather
let
me
strive
to
be
glad
that
she
my
is
so
far
removed
from
my
unworthiness
let
her
if
she
be
near
me
now
read
my
thoughts
and
see
in
them
how
dear
how
sacred
is
her
fair
and
glorious
memory
how
i
would
rather
endure
an
eternity
of
anguish
than
make
her
sad
for
one
brief
hour
of
time
he
was
greatly
moved
his
voice
trembled
with
the
fervor
of
its
own
music
and
heliobas
looked
at
him
with
a
grave
and
very
tender
smile
enough
he
said
gently
i
will
speak
no
further
on
this
subject
which
i
see
affects
you
deeply
nevertheless
i
would
have
you
remember
how
when
the
master
whom
we
serve
passed
through
his
agony
at
gethsemane
and
with
all
the
knowledge
of
his
own
power
and
glory
strong
upon
him
still
in
his
vast
said
my
will
but
thine
be
done
that
then
appeared
an
angel
unto
him
from
heaven
strengthening
him
think
of
this
for
every
incident
in
that
life
is
a
hint
for
ours
and
often
it
chances
that
when
we
reject
happiness
for
the
sake
of
goodness
happiness
is
suddenly
bestowed
upon
us
god
miracles
are
endless
god
blessings
exhaustless
and
the
marvels
of
this
wondrous
universe
are
as
nothing
compared
to
the
working
of
his
sovereign
will
for
good
on
the
lives
of
those
who
serve
him
faithfully
alwyn
flashed
upon
him
a
quick
glance
but
was
silent
and
they
walked
on
together
for
some
minutes
without
exchanging
a
word
a
few
people
passed
and
repassed
them
some
little
children
were
playing
behind
the
trunks
of
the
largest
trees
the
air
was
fresh
and
invigorating
and
the
incessant
roar
of
busy
traffic
outside
the
park
palings
offered
a
perpetual
noisy
reminder
of
the
great
world
that
surged
around
them
the
world
of
petty
aims
and
transitory
pleasures
with
which
they
filled
full
of
the
knowledge
of
higher
and
eternal
things
had
so
little
in
common
save
sympathy
sympathy
for
the
wilful
of
man
and
pity
for
his
blindness
presently
heliobas
spoke
again
in
his
customary
light
and
cheerful
tone
are
you
writing
anything
new
just
now
he
asked
or
are
you
resting
from
literary
labor
well
rest
and
work
are
with
me
very
nearly
one
and
the
same
replied
alwyn
i
think
the
most
absolutely
tiring
and
exhausting
thing
in
the
world
would
be
to
have
nothing
to
do
then
i
can
imagine
life
becoming
indeed
a
weighty
burden
yes
i
am
engaged
on
a
new
poem
it
gives
me
intense
pleasure
to
write
it
but
whether
it
will
give
any
one
equal
pleasure
to
read
it
is
quite
another
question
does
still
loom
on
your
horizon
inquired
his
companion
mirthfully
or
are
you
still
inclined
as
in
the
past
to
treat
him
whether
he
comes
singly
or
in
numbers
as
the
poet
and
paid
fool
alwyn
laughed
lightly
perhaps
he
answered
with
a
sparkle
of
amusement
in
his
eyes
but
really
so
far
as
the
wind
of
criticism
goes
i
do
think
any
author
nowadays
particularly
cares
whether
it
blows
fair
weather
or
foul
you
see
we
all
know
how
it
is
done
we
can
name
the
clubs
and
cliques
from
whence
it
emanates
and
we
are
fully
aware
that
if
one
leading
man
of
a
gives
the
starting
signal
of
praise
or
blame
the
rest
follow
like
sheep
without
either
thought
or
personal
discrimination
moreover
some
of
us
have
met
and
talked
with
certain
of
these
magazine
and
newspaper
oracles
and
have
tested
for
ourselves
the
limited
extent
of
their
knowledge
and
the
shallowness
of
their
wit
i
assure
you
it
often
happens
that
a
great
author
is
tried
judged
and
condemned
by
a
little
casual
who
in
his
very
criticism
proves
himself
ignorant
of
grammar
of
course
if
the
public
choose
to
accept
such
a
verdict
why
then
all
the
worse
for
the
public
but
luckily
the
majority
of
men
are
beginning
to
learn
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
modern
business
they
see
his
or
her
methods
it
is
a
notable
fact
that
women
do
a
great
deal
of
criticism
now
they
being
willing
to
scribble
oracular
commonplaces
at
a
cheaper
rate
of
pay
than
men
so
that
if
a
book
is
condemned
people
are
dubious
and
straight
way
read
it
for
themselves
to
see
what
is
in
it
that
excites
aversion
if
it
is
praised
they
are
still
dubious
and
generally
decide
that
the
critical
eulogist
must
have
some
personal
interest
in
its
sale
it
is
difficult
for
an
author
to
win
his
public
but
when
won
the
critics
may
applaud
or
deride
as
suits
their
humor
it
makes
no
appreciable
difference
to
his
popularity
now
i
consider
my
own
present
fame
was
won
by
chance
a
misconception
that
as
know
had
its
ancient
foundation
in
truth
but
that
as
far
as
everybody
else
is
concerned
remains
a
misconception
so
that
i
estimate
my
success
at
its
right
value
or
rather
let
me
say
at
its
proper
worthlessness
and
in
a
few
words
he
related
how
the
leaders
of
english
journalism
had
judged
him
dead
and
had
praised
his
work
chiefly
because
it
was
posthumous
i
believe
he
added
that
if
this
mistake
had
not
arisen
i
should
scarcely
have
been
heard
of
since
i
advocate
no
particular
and
belong
to
no
mutual
admiration
alliance
offensive
or
defensive
but
my
supposed
untimely
decease
served
me
better
than
the
browning
society
serves
browning
again
he
laughed
heliobas
had
listened
with
a
keen
and
sarcastic
enjoyment
of
the
whole
story
undoubtedly
your
was
no
phantom
he
observed
emphatically
his
was
evidently
a
very
real
existence
and
he
must
have
divided
himself
from
one
into
several
to
sit
in
judgment
again
upon
you
in
this
present
day
history
repeats
itself
and
unhappily
all
the
injustice
hypocrisy
and
inconsistency
of
man
is
repeated
too
and
out
of
the
multitudes
that
inhabit
the
earth
how
few
will
succeed
in
fulfilling
their
highest
destinies
this
is
the
one
bitter
drop
in
the
cup
of
our
knowledge
we
can
if
we
choose
save
ourselves
but
we
can
seldom
if
ever
save
others
alwyn
stopped
short
his
eyes
darkening
with
a
swift
intensity
of
feeling
why
not
he
asked
earnestly
must
we
look
on
and
see
men
rushing
toward
certain
misery
without
making
an
effort
to
turn
them
hack
to
warn
them
of
the
darkness
whither
they
are
bound
to
rescue
them
before
it
is
too
late
my
friend
we
can
make
the
effort
certainly
and
we
are
bound
to
make
it
because
it
is
our
duty
but
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
we
shall
fail
of
our
persuasion
what
can
i
or
you
or
any
one
do
against
the
iron
force
of
god
himself
will
not
constrain
it
how
then
shall
we
in
the
books
of
esdras
which
have
already
been
of
such
use
to
you
you
will
find
the
following
significant
words
most
high
hath
made
this
world
for
many
but
the
world
to
come
for
few
as
when
thou
askest
the
earth
it
shall
say
unto
thee
that
it
giveth
much
mold
wherein
earthen
vessels
are
made
and
but
little
dust
that
gold
cometh
of
even
so
is
the
course
of
this
present
world
there
be
many
created
but
few
shall
be
saved
god
elects
to
be
served
by
choice
and
not
by
compulsion
it
is
his
law
that
man
shall
work
out
his
own
immortal
destiny
and
nothing
can
alter
this
overwhelming
fact
the
sublime
example
of
christ
was
given
us
as
a
means
to
assist
us
in
forming
our
own
conclusions
but
there
is
no
coercion
in
it
only
a
divine
love
you
for
instance
were
and
are
still
perfectly
free
to
reject
the
whole
of
your
experience
on
the
field
of
ardath
as
a
delusion
nothing
would
be
easier
and
from
the
world
point
of
view
nothing
more
natural
faith
and
doubt
are
equally
voluntary
acts
the
one
is
the
instinct
of
the
immortal
soul
the
other
the
tendency
of
the
perishable
body
and
the
will
decides
which
of
the
two
shall
conquer
in
the
end
i
know
that
you
are
firm
in
your
high
and
true
conviction
i
know
also
what
thoughts
are
at
work
in
your
brain
you
are
bending
all
your
energies
on
the
task
of
trying
to
instil
into
the
minds
of
your
some
comprehension
of
the
enlightenment
and
hope
you
yourself
possess
ah
you
must
prepare
for
disappointment
for
though
the
times
are
tending
toward
strange
upheavals
and
terrors
when
the
of
an
inspired
poet
may
do
enormous
good
still
the
name
of
the
wilfully
ignorant
is
legion
the
age
is
one
of
the
grossest
mammon
worship
and
coarsest
atheism
and
the
noblest
teachings
of
the
noblest
teacher
were
he
even
another
shakespeare
must
of
necessity
be
but
a
casting
of
pearls
before
swine
still
and
his
rare
sweet
smile
brightened
the
serene
dignity
of
his
features
fling
out
the
pearls
freely
all
the
same
the
swine
may
grunt
at
but
can
not
rend
you
and
a
genius
should
be
like
the
sunlight
that
falls
on
rich
and
poor
good
and
bad
with
glorious
impartiality
if
you
can
comfort
one
sorrow
check
one
sin
or
rescue
one
soul
from
the
widening
quicksand
of
the
atheist
world
you
have
sufficient
reason
to
be
devoutly
thankful
by
this
time
their
walk
had
led
them
imperceptibly
to
one
of
the
gates
of
egress
from
the
park
and
heliobas
pointing
to
a
huge
square
building
opposite
said
there
is
the
hotel
at
which
i
am
staying
one
of
the
americanized
monster
fabrics
in
which
tired
travellers
find
much
splendid
show
and
little
rest
will
you
lunch
with
me
i
am
quite
alone
alwyn
gladly
assented
he
was
most
unwilling
to
part
at
once
from
this
man
to
whom
in
a
measure
he
felt
he
owed
his
present
happy
and
tranquil
condition
of
body
and
mind
besides
he
was
curious
to
find
out
more
about
him
to
obtain
from
him
if
possible
an
entire
explanation
of
the
actual
tenets
and
chief
characteristics
of
the
system
of
religious
worship
he
himself
practiced
and
followed
heliobas
seemed
to
guess
his
thoughts
for
suddenly
turning
upon
him
with
a
quick
glance
he
observed
you
want
to
out
the
heart
of
my
mystery
as
hamlet
says
do
you
not
my
friend
and
he
smiled
well
so
you
shall
if
you
can
discover
aught
in
me
that
is
not
already
in
yourself
i
assure
you
there
is
nothing
preternatural
about
me
my
peculiar
consists
in
steadily
adapting
myself
to
the
scientific
spiritual
as
well
as
scientific
material
laws
of
the
universe
the
two
sets
of
laws
united
make
harmony
hence
i
find
my
life
harmonious
and
satisfactory
this
is
my
condition
of
mind
and
you
are
now
fully
as
as
i
am
come
we
will
discuss
our
mutual
strange
to
the
wild
world
custom
or
caprice
over
a
glass
of
good
wine
observe
please
that
i
am
neither
a
abstainer
nor
a
and
that
i
have
a
curious
fashion
of
being
temperate
and
of
using
all
the
gifts
of
beneficent
nature
equally
and
without
prejudice
while
he
spoke
they
had
crossed
the
road
and
they
now
entered
the
vestibule
of
the
hotel
where
declining
the
offer
of
the
lift
heliobas
ascended
the
stairs
leisurely
to
the
second
floor
and
ushered
his
companion
into
a
comfortable
private
fancy
men
consenting
to
be
drawn
up
to
their
apartments
like
babes
in
a
basket
he
said
laughingly
alluding
to
the
lift
process
upon
my
word
when
i
think
of
the
strong
people
of
a
past
age
and
compare
them
with
the
enervated
race
of
i
feel
not
only
pity
but
shame
for
the
visible
degeneration
of
mankind
frail
nerves
weak
hearts
uncertain
limbs
these
are
common
characteristics
of
the
young
nowadays
instead
of
being
as
formerly
the
natural
failings
of
the
old
wear
and
tear
and
worry
of
modern
existence
oh
yes
i
know
but
why
the
wear
tear
and
worry
at
all
what
is
it
for
simply
for
the
of
money
one
must
live
certainly
but
one
is
not
bound
to
live
in
foolish
luxury
for
the
sake
of
neighbors
better
to
live
simply
and
preserve
health
than
gain
a
fortune
and
be
a
moping
dyspeptic
for
life
but
unless
one
toils
and
moils
like
a
beast
of
burden
one
can
not
even
live
simply
some
will
say
i
do
believe
that
assertion
the
peasants
of
france
live
simply
and
save
the
peasants
of
england
live
wretchedly
and
waste
voila
la
difference
as
with
nations
so
with
individuals
it
is
all
a
question
of
will
there
a
will
there
a
way
is
a
dreadfully
trite
copybook
maxim
but
it
amazingly
true
all
the
same
now
let
us
to
the
acceptation
of
these
good
things
this
as
a
pallid
waiter
just
then
entered
the
room
with
the
luncheon
and
in
his
bustling
to
and
fro
manifested
unusual
eagerness
to
make
himself
agreeable
i
have
made
excellent
friends
with
this
young
ganymede
he
has
sworn
never
to
palm
off
upon
me
for
chambertin
the
waiter
blushed
and
chuckled
as
though
he
were
conscious
of
having
gained
special
new
dignity
and
importance
and
having
laid
the
table
and
set
the
chairs
he
departed
with
a
flourishing
bow
worthy
of
a
prince
your
name
must
seem
a
curious
one
to
these
fellows
observed
alwyn
when
he
had
gone
unusual
and
even
mysterious
why
yes
returned
heliobas
with
a
laugh
it
would
be
judged
so
i
suppose
if
i
ever
gave
it
but
i
do
it
was
only
in
england
and
by
an
englishman
that
i
was
once
to
my
utter
amazement
addressed
as
and
i
was
quite
alarmed
at
the
sound
of
it
one
would
think
that
most
people
in
these
educational
days
knew
the
greek
word
helios
and
one
would
also
imagine
it
as
easy
to
say
heliobas
as
heliograph
but
now
to
avoid
mistakes
whenever
i
touch
british
territory
and
come
into
contact
with
british
tongues
i
give
my
christian
name
only
cassimir
the
result
of
which
arrangement
is
that
i
am
known
in
this
hotel
as
kasmer
oh
i
do
mind
in
the
least
why
should
i
neither
the
english
nor
the
americans
ever
pronounce
foreign
names
properly
why
i
met
a
newly
established
young
publisher
yesterday
who
assured
me
that
most
of
his
authors
the
female
ones
especially
are
so
ignorant
of
foreign
literature
that
he
doubts
whether
any
of
them
know
whether
cervantes
was
a
writer
or
an
ointment
alwyn
laughed
i
dare
say
the
young
publisher
may
be
perfectly
right
he
said
but
all
the
same
he
has
no
business
to
publish
the
literary
emanations
of
such
ignorance
perhaps
not
but
what
is
he
to
do
if
nothing
else
is
offered
to
him
he
has
to
keep
his
occupation
going
somehow
from
bad
he
must
select
the
best
he
can
not
create
a
great
genius
he
has
to
wait
till
nature
in
the
course
of
events
evolves
one
from
the
elements
and
in
the
present
general
dearth
of
high
ability
the
publishers
are
really
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
they
spend
large
sums
and
incur
large
risks
in
launching
new
ventures
on
the
fickle
sea
of
popular
favor
and
often
their
trouble
is
taken
all
in
vain
it
is
really
the
stupid
egotism
of
authors
that
is
the
in
the
way
of
true
literature
each
little
scribbler
that
produces
a
shilling
sensational
thinks
his
or
her
own
work
a
marvel
of
genius
and
nothing
can
shake
them
from
their
obstinate
conviction
if
every
man
or
woman
before
putting
pen
to
paper
would
be
sure
they
had
something
new
suggestive
symbolical
or
beautiful
to
say
how
greatly
art
might
gain
by
their
labors
authors
who
take
up
arms
against
publishers
en
masse
and
in
every
transaction
expect
to
be
cheated
are
doing
themselves
irreparable
injury
they
betray
the
cloven
hoof
namely
a
greed
for
money
and
when
once
that
passion
dominates
them
down
goes
their
reputation
and
they
with
it
it
is
the
old
story
over
again
can
not
serve
god
and
mammon
and
all
art
is
a
portion
of
god
a
descending
of
the
divine
into
humanity
alwyn
sat
for
a
minute
silent
and
thoughtful
a
descending
of
the
divine
into
humanity
he
repeated
slowly
it
seems
to
me
that
is
forever
being
enacted
and
yet
we
doubt
we
do
not
doubt
said
heliobas
we
know
we
have
touched
reality
but
see
yonder
and
he
pointed
through
the
window
to
the
crowded
thoroughfare
below
there
are
the
flying
phantoms
of
life
the
men
and
women
who
are
and
who
are
therefore
no
more
actually
living
than
the
shadows
of
they
shall
pass
as
a
breath
and
be
no
more
and
this
roaring
trafficking
metropolis
this
immediate
centre
of
civilization
shall
ere
long
disappear
off
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
leave
not
a
stone
to
mark
the
spot
where
once
it
stood
so
have
thousands
of
such
cities
fallen
since
this
planet
was
flung
into
space
and
even
so
shall
thousands
still
fall
learning
civilization
science
progress
these
things
exist
merely
for
the
training
and
education
of
a
chosen
few
and
out
of
many
earth
centuries
and
generations
of
men
shall
be
won
only
a
very
small
company
of
angels
be
glad
that
you
have
fathomed
the
mystery
of
your
own
purpose
for
you
are
now
as
much
a
positive
identity
among
vanishing
spectres
as
you
were
when
on
the
field
of
ardath
you
witnessed
and
took
part
in
the
mirage
of
your
past
chapter
xxxvii
a
missing
record
he
spoke
the
last
words
with
deep
feeling
and
earnestness
and
alwyn
meeting
his
clear
grave
brilliant
eyes
was
more
than
ever
impressed
by
the
singular
dignity
and
overpowering
magnetism
of
his
presence
remembering
how
insufficiently
he
had
realized
this
man
true
worth
when
he
had
first
sought
him
out
in
his
monastic
retreat
he
was
struck
by
a
sudden
sense
of
remorse
and
leaning
across
the
table
gently
touched
his
hand
how
greatly
i
wronged
you
once
heliobas
he
said
penitently
with
a
tremor
of
appeal
in
his
voice
forgive
me
will
you
though
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
heliobas
smiled
and
cordially
pressed
the
extended
hand
in
his
own
nay
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
my
friend
he
answered
cheerfully
and
nothing
to
regret
your
doubts
of
me
were
very
natural
indeed
viewed
by
the
world
standard
of
opinion
much
more
natural
than
your
present
faith
for
faith
is
always
a
instinct
would
you
be
practically
sensible
according
to
modern
social
theories
then
learn
to
suspect
everybody
and
everything
even
your
best
friend
good
intentions
he
laughed
and
the
luncheon
being
concluded
he
rose
from
the
table
and
taking
an
nearer
the
window
motioned
alwyn
to
do
the
same
i
want
to
talk
to
you
he
continued
we
may
not
meet
again
for
years
you
are
entering
on
a
difficult
career
and
a
few
hints
from
one
who
knows
and
thoroughly
understands
your
position
may
possibly
be
of
use
to
you
in
the
first
place
then
let
me
ask
you
have
you
told
any
one
save
me
the
story
of
your
ardath
adventure
one
friend
only
my
old
school
comrade
frank
villiers
replied
alwyn
and
what
does
he
say
about
it
oh
he
thinks
it
was
a
dream
from
beginning
to
end
and
alwyn
smiled
a
little
he
believes
that
i
set
out
on
my
journey
with
my
brain
already
heated
to
an
imaginative
excess
and
that
the
whole
thing
even
my
angel
presence
was
a
pure
delusion
of
my
own
overwrought
fancy
a
curious
and
wonderful
delusion
but
always
a
delusion
he
is
a
very
excellent
fellow
to
judge
you
so
leniently
observed
heliobas
composedly
most
people
would
call
you
mad
mad
exclaimed
alwyn
hotly
why
i
am
as
sane
as
any
man
in
london
saner
i
should
say
replied
heliobas
smiling
compared
with
some
of
the
eminently
speculating
maniacs
that
howl
and
struggle
among
the
fluctuating
currents
of
the
stock
exchange
for
instance
you
are
indeed
a
marvel
of
sound
and
wholesome
mental
capability
but
let
us
view
the
matter
coolly
you
must
not
expect
such
an
exceptional
experience
as
yours
to
be
believed
in
by
ordinary
persons
because
the
majority
of
people
being
utterly
unspiritual
and
worldly
have
no
such
experiences
and
they
therefore
deem
them
impossible
they
are
the
born
in
a
bowl
who
have
no
consciousness
of
the
existence
of
an
ocean
moreover
you
have
no
proofs
of
the
truth
of
your
narrative
beyond
the
change
in
your
own
life
and
disposition
and
that
can
be
easily
referred
to
various
other
causes
you
spoke
of
having
gathered
one
of
the
on
the
prophet
field
may
i
see
it
silently
alwyn
drew
from
his
the
velvet
case
in
which
he
always
kept
the
cherished
blossom
and
taking
it
tenderly
out
placed
it
in
his
companion
hand
an
immortelle
said
heliobas
softly
while
the
flower
uncurling
its
silvery
petals
in
the
warmth
of
his
palm
opened
and
white
as
snow
an
immortelle
rare
and
possibly
unique
that
is
all
the
world
would
say
of
it
it
can
not
be
matched
it
will
not
fade
true
but
you
will
get
no
one
to
believe
that
frown
not
good
poet
i
want
you
to
consider
me
for
the
moment
a
practical
worldling
bent
on
driving
you
from
the
spiritual
position
yon
have
taken
up
and
you
will
see
how
necessary
it
is
for
you
to
keep
the
secret
of
your
own
enlightenment
to
yourself
or
at
least
only
hint
at
it
through
the
parables
of
poesy
he
gave
back
the
ardath
blossom
to
its
owner
with
reverent
care
and
when
alwyn
had
as
reverently
put
it
by
he
resumed
your
friend
villiers
has
offered
you
a
perfectly
logical
and
solution
of
the
mystery
of
ardath
one
which
if
you
chose
to
accept
it
would
drive
you
back
into
skepticism
as
easily
as
a
strong
wind
blows
a
straw
only
see
how
simple
the
intricate
problem
is
unravelled
by
this
means
you
a
man
of
ardent
and
imaginative
temperament
made
more
or
less
unhappy
by
the
doctrines
of
materialism
come
to
me
heliobas
a
chaldean
student
of
the
higher
philosophies
an
individual
whose
supposed
mysterious
power
and
inexplicably
studious
way
of
life
entitle
him
to
be
considered
by
the
world
at
large
an
imposter
now
do
look
so
indignant
and
he
laughed
i
am
merely
discussing
the
question
from
the
point
of
view
that
would
be
sure
to
be
adopted
by
modern
society
thus
i
heliobas
the
impostor
take
advantage
of
your
state
of
mind
to
throw
you
into
a
trance
in
which
by
occult
means
you
see
the
vision
of
an
angel
who
bids
you
meet
her
at
a
place
called
ardath
and
you
also
in
your
hypnotized
condition
write
a
poem
which
you
entitle
then
i
always
playing
my
own
little
underhand
game
read
you
portions
of
and
prove
to
you
that
exists
while
i
delicately
suggest
if
i
do
not
absolutely
command
your
going
thither
you
go
but
i
still
by
magnetic
power
retain
my
influence
over
you
you
visit
elzear
a
hermit
whom
we
will
for
the
sake
of
the
present
argument
call
my
accomplice
he
reads
between
the
lines
of
the
letter
you
deliver
to
him
from
me
and
he
understands
its
secret
import
he
continues
no
matter
how
your
delusion
you
broke
your
fast
with
him
and
surely
it
was
easy
for
him
to
place
some
potent
drug
in
the
wine
he
gave
you
which
made
you
dream
the
rest
nay
viewed
from
this
standpoint
it
is
open
to
question
whether
you
ever
went
to
the
field
of
ardath
at
all
but
merely
dreamed
you
did
you
see
how
admirably
i
can
with
little
trouble
disprove
the
whole
story
and
make
myself
out
to
be
the
veriest
charlatan
and
trickster
that
ever
duped
his
credulous
how
do
you
like
my
practical
dissection
of
your
joys
alwyn
was
gazing
at
him
with
puzzled
and
anxious
eyes
i
do
not
like
it
at
all
he
murmured
in
a
pained
tone
it
is
an
insidious
semblance
of
truth
but
i
know
it
is
not
the
truth
itself
why
how
obstinate
you
are
said
heliobas
with
a
quick
flashing
glance
at
him
you
insist
on
seeing
things
in
a
directly
reverse
way
to
that
in
which
the
world
sees
them
how
can
you
be
so
foolish
to
the
world
your
ardath
adventure
is
the
semblance
of
truth
and
only
man
opinion
thereon
is
worth
trusting
as
the
truth
itself
over
the
wistful
brooding
thoughtfulness
of
alwyn
countenance
swept
a
sudden
light
of
magnificent
resolution
heliobas
do
not
jest
with
me
he
cried
passionately
i
know
better
perhaps
than
most
men
how
divine
things
can
be
argued
away
by
the
jargon
of
tongues
till
heart
and
brain
grow
weary
i
know
god
help
me
how
the
noblest
ideals
of
the
soul
can
be
swept
down
and
dispersed
into
blank
ruin
by
the
specious
arguments
of
casuists
but
i
also
know
by
a
supreme
inner
knowledge
beyond
all
human
proving
that
god
exists
and
with
his
being
exist
likewise
all
splendors
great
and
small
spiritual
and
material
splendors
vaster
than
our
intelligence
can
reach
ideals
loftier
than
imagination
can
depict
i
want
no
proof
of
this
save
those
that
burn
in
my
own
individual
consciousness
i
do
not
need
a
miserable
taper
of
human
reason
to
help
me
to
discern
the
sun
i
of
my
own
choice
prayer
and
hope
voluntarily
believe
in
god
in
christ
in
angels
in
all
things
beautiful
and
pure
and
grand
let
the
world
and
its
ephemeral
opinions
wither
i
will
not
be
shaken
down
from
the
first
step
of
the
ladder
whereon
one
climbs
to
heaven
his
features
were
radiant
with
fervor
and
feeling
his
eyes
brilliant
with
the
kindling
inward
light
of
noblest
aspiration
and
heliobas
who
had
watched
him
intently
now
bent
toward
him
with
a
grave
gesture
of
the
gentlest
homage
how
strong
is
he
whom
an
angel
love
makes
glorious
he
said
we
are
partners
in
the
same
destiny
my
friend
and
i
have
but
spoken
to
you
as
the
world
might
speak
to
prepare
you
for
opposition
the
specious
arguments
of
men
confront
us
at
every
turn
in
every
book
in
every
society
and
it
is
not
always
that
we
are
ready
to
meet
them
as
a
rule
silence
on
all
matters
of
personal
faith
is
best
let
your
life
bear
witness
for
you
it
shall
thunder
loud
oracles
when
your
mortal
limbs
are
dumb
he
paused
a
moment
then
went
on
you
have
desired
to
know
the
secret
of
the
active
and
often
miraculous
power
of
the
special
form
of
religion
i
and
my
brethren
follow
well
it
is
all
contained
in
christ
and
christ
only
his
is
the
only
true
spiritualism
in
the
world
there
was
never
any
before
he
came
we
obey
christ
in
the
simple
rules
he
preached
christ
according
to
his
own
enunciated
wish
and
will
moreover
we
that
is
our
fraternity
received
our
commission
from
christ
himself
in
person
alwyn
started
his
eyes
dilated
with
amazement
and
awe
from
christ
himself
in
person
he
echoed
incredulously
even
so
returned
heliobas
calmly
what
do
you
suppose
our
divine
master
was
about
during
the
years
between
his
appearance
among
the
rabbis
of
the
temple
and
the
commencement
of
his
public
preaching
do
you
can
you
imagine
with
the
rest
of
the
purblind
world
that
he
would
have
left
his
marvellous
gospel
in
the
charge
of
a
few
fishermen
and
common
folk
only
i
never
thought
i
never
inquired
began
alwyn
hurriedly
no
and
heliobas
smiled
rather
sadly
few
men
do
think
or
inquire
very
far
on
sacred
subjects
listen
for
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
will
but
strengthen
you
in
your
faith
and
you
will
need
more
than
all
the
strength
of
the
four
evangelists
to
bear
you
stiffly
up
against
the
suicidal
negation
of
this
present
disastrous
epoch
ages
ago
ay
more
than
six
or
seven
thousand
years
ago
there
were
certain
communities
of
men
in
the
east
scholars
sages
poets
astronomers
and
scientists
who
desiring
to
give
themselves
up
entirely
to
study
and
research
withdrew
from
the
world
and
formed
themselves
into
fraternities
dividing
whatever
goods
they
had
in
common
and
living
together
under
one
roof
as
the
brotherhoods
of
the
catholic
church
do
to
this
day
the
primal
object
of
these
men
investigations
was
a
search
after
the
divine
cause
of
creation
and
as
it
was
undertaken
with
prayer
penance
humility
and
reverence
much
enlightenment
was
vouchsafed
to
them
and
secrets
of
science
both
spiritual
and
material
were
discovered
by
them
secrets
which
the
wisest
of
modern
sages
know
nothing
of
as
yet
out
of
these
fraternities
came
many
of
the
prophets
and
preachers
of
the
old
testament
esdras
for
one
isaiah
for
another
they
were
the
chroniclers
of
many
now
forgotten
events
they
kept
the
history
of
the
times
as
far
is
it
was
possible
and
in
their
ancient
records
your
city
of
is
mentioned
as
a
great
and
populous
place
which
was
suddenly
destroyed
by
the
bursting
out
of
a
volcano
beneath
its
foundations
yes
this
as
alwyn
uttered
an
eager
exclamation
your
vision
was
a
perfectly
faithful
reflection
of
the
manner
in
which
it
perished
i
must
tell
you
however
that
nothing
concerning
its
kings
or
great
men
has
been
preserved
only
a
few
allusions
to
one
hyspiros
a
writer
of
tragedies
whose
genius
seems
to
have
corresponded
to
that
of
our
shakespeare
of
the
name
of
is
nowhere
extant
a
burning
wave
of
color
flushed
alwyn
face
but
he
was
silent
heliobas
went
on
gently
at
a
very
early
period
of
their
formation
these
fraternities
i
tell
you
of
were
in
possession
of
most
of
the
material
scientific
facts
of
the
present
day
such
things
as
the
electric
wire
and
battery
the
phonograph
the
telephone
and
other
discoveries
being
perfectly
familiar
to
them
the
spiritual
manifestations
of
nature
were
more
intricate
and
difficult
to
penetrate
and
though
they
knew
that
material
effects
could
only
be
produced
by
spiritual
causes
they
worked
in
the
dark
as
it
were
only
groping
toward
the
light
however
the
wisdom
and
purity
of
the
lives
they
led
was
not
without
its
effect
emperors
and
kings
sought
their
advice
and
gave
them
great
stores
of
wealth
which
they
divided
according
to
rule
into
equal
portions
and
used
for
the
benefit
of
those
in
need
willing
the
remainder
to
their
successors
so
that
at
the
present
time
the
few
brotherhoods
that
are
left
hold
immense
treasures
accumulated
through
many
centuries
treasures
which
are
theirs
to
share
with
one
another
in
prosecution
of
discoveries
and
the
carrying
on
of
good
works
in
secret
ages
before
the
coming
of
christ
one
aselzion
a
man
of
austere
and
strict
life
belonging
to
a
fraternity
stationed
in
syria
was
engaged
in
working
out
a
calculation
of
the
average
quantity
of
heat
and
light
provided
per
minute
by
the
sun
rays
when
glancing
upward
at
the
sky
the
hour
being
clear
noonday
he
beheld
a
cross
of
crimson
hue
suspended
in
the
sky
whereon
hung
the
cloudy
semblance
of
a
human
figure
believing
himself
to
be
the
victim
of
some
optical
delusion
he
hastened
to
fetch
some
of
his
brethren
who
at
a
glance
perceived
the
marvel
which
presently
was
viewed
with
reverent
wonder
by
the
whole
assembled
community
for
one
entire
hour
the
symbol
stayed
then
vanished
suddenly
a
noise
like
thunder
accompanying
its
departure
within
a
few
months
of
its
appearance
messages
came
from
all
the
other
fraternities
stationed
in
egypt
in
spain
in
greece
in
etruria
stating
that
they
also
had
seen
this
singular
sight
and
suggesting
that
from
henceforth
the
cross
should
be
adopted
by
the
united
brotherhoods
as
a
holy
sign
of
some
deity
unrevealed
a
proposition
that
was
at
once
agreed
to
this
happened
some
five
thousand
years
before
christ
and
hence
the
sign
of
the
cross
became
known
in
all
or
nearly
all
the
ancient
rites
of
worship
the
multitude
considering
that
because
it
was
the
emblem
of
the
philosophical
fraternities
it
must
have
some
sacred
meaning
so
it
was
used
in
the
service
of
serapis
and
the
adoration
of
the
it
has
been
found
carved
on
egyptian
disks
and
obelisks
and
it
was
included
among
the
numerous
symbols
of
saturn
he
paused
alwyn
was
listening
with
eager
almost
breathless
attention
after
this
went
on
heliobas
came
a
long
period
of
prefigurements
types
and
suggestions
that
running
through
all
the
various
religions
that
sprang
up
swiftly
and
as
swiftly
decayed
hinted
vaguely
at
the
birth
of
a
child
offspring
of
a
pure
virgin
a
miraculously
generated
an
absolutely
sinless
one
who
should
be
sent
to
remind
humanity
of
its
intended
final
high
destiny
and
who
should
by
precept
and
example
draw
the
earth
nearer
to
heaven
i
would
here
ask
you
to
note
what
most
people
seem
to
forget
namely
that
since
christ
came
all
these
shadowy
types
and
prefigurements
have
ceased
a
notable
fact
even
to
skeptical
minds
the
world
waited
dimly
for
something
it
knew
not
what
the
various
fraternities
of
the
cross
waited
also
feeling
conscious
that
some
great
era
of
hope
and
happiness
was
about
to
dawn
for
all
men
when
the
star
in
the
east
arose
announcing
the
birth
there
were
some
forty
or
fifty
of
these
fraternities
existing
three
in
the
ancient
province
of
chaldea
from
whence
a
company
of
the
wisest
seers
and
sages
were
sent
to
acknowledge
by
their
immediate
homage
the
divinity
born
in
bethlehem
these
were
the
men
out
of
the
east
mentioned
in
the
gospel
we
knew
i
say
we
because
i
am
descended
directly
from
one
of
these
men
and
have
always
belonged
to
their
brotherhood
we
knew
it
was
divinity
that
had
come
amongst
us
and
in
our
parchment
chronicles
there
is
a
long
account
of
how
the
deserts
of
arabia
rang
with
music
that
holy
night
what
wealth
of
flowers
sprang
up
in
places
that
had
hither
to
lain
waste
and
dry
how
the
sky
blazed
with
rings
of
roseate
radiance
how
fair
and
wondrous
shapes
were
seen
flitting
across
the
heavens
the
road
of
communication
between
men
and
angels
being
opened
at
a
touch
by
the
saviour
advent
again
he
paused
and
after
a
little
silence
resumed
then
we
added
the
star
to
our
existing
symbol
the
cross
and
became
the
brotherhood
of
the
cross
and
star
as
such
after
the
birth
we
put
all
other
matters
from
us
and
set
ourselves
to
chronicle
his
life
and
actions
to
pray
and
wait
unknowing
what
might
be
the
course
of
his
work
or
will
one
day
he
came
to
us
ah
happy
those
whom
he
found
watching
and
whose
privilege
it
was
to
receive
their
divine
guest
his
voice
had
a
passionate
thrill
within
it
as
of
tears
and
heart
beat
fast
what
a
wonderful
new
chapter
was
here
revealed
of
the
old
old
story
of
the
only
perfect
life
on
earth
one
of
the
fraternities
went
on
heliobas
had
its
habitation
in
the
wilderness
where
some
years
later
the
master
wandered
fasting
forty
days
and
forty
nights
to
that
solitary
abode
of
prayerful
men
he
came
when
he
was
about
earthly
years
of
age
the
record
of
his
visit
has
been
reverently
penned
and
preserved
and
from
it
we
know
how
fair
and
strong
he
was
how
stately
and
like
a
king
how
gracious
and
noble
in
bearing
how
far
exceeding
in
beauty
all
the
sons
of
men
his
speech
was
music
that
thrilled
to
the
heart
the
wondrous
glory
of
his
eyes
gave
life
to
those
who
knelt
and
worshipped
him
his
touch
was
pardon
his
smile
was
peace
from
his
own
lips
a
store
of
wisdom
was
set
down
and
prophecies
concerning
the
fate
of
his
own
teaching
which
then
he
uttered
are
only
now
at
this
very
day
being
fulfilled
therefore
we
know
the
time
has
come
he
broke
off
and
sighed
deeply
the
time
has
come
for
what
demanded
alwyn
eagerly
for
certain
secrets
to
be
made
known
to
the
world
which
till
now
have
been
kept
sacred
returned
heliobas
you
must
understand
that
the
chief
vow
of
the
fraternity
of
the
cross
and
star
is
secrecy
a
promise
never
to
divulge
the
mysteries
of
god
and
nature
to
those
who
are
unfitted
to
receive
such
high
instruction
it
is
christ
own
saying
faithless
and
perverse
generation
asketh
for
a
sign
and
no
sign
shall
be
given
you
surely
are
aware
how
even
in
the
simplest
discoveries
of
material
science
the
world
attitude
is
at
first
one
of
jeering
incredulity
how
much
more
so
then
in
things
which
pertain
solely
to
the
spiritual
side
of
existence
but
god
will
not
be
mocked
and
it
behooves
us
to
think
long
and
pray
much
before
we
unveil
even
one
of
the
lesser
mysteries
to
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
christ
knew
the
immutable
condition
of
he
knew
that
faith
humility
and
obedience
are
the
hardest
of
all
hard
virtues
to
the
arrogance
of
man
and
we
learned
from
him
that
his
gospel
simple
though
it
is
would
be
denied
disputed
quarrelled
over
shamefully
distorted
and
almost
lost
sight
of
in
a
multitude
of
opinions
that
his
truth
would
be
obscured
and
rendered
incomprehensible
by
the
wilful
obstinacy
of
human
arguments
concerning
it
christ
has
no
part
whatever
in
the
distinctly
human
atrocities
that
have
been
perpetrated
under
cover
of
his
name
such
as
the
inquisition
the
wars
of
the
crusades
the
slaughter
of
martyrs
and
the
degrading
bitterness
of
sects
in
all
these
things
teaching
is
entirely
set
aside
and
lost
he
knew
how
the
proud
of
this
world
would
misread
his
words
that
is
why
he
came
to
men
who
for
thousands
of
years
in
succession
had
steadily
practised
the
qualities
he
most
desired
namely
faith
humility
and
obedience
and
finding
them
ready
to
carry
out
his
will
he
left
with
them
the
mystic
secrets
of
his
doctrine
which
he
forbade
them
to
give
to
the
multitude
till
men
quarrels
and
disputations
had
called
his
very
existence
into
doubt
then
through
pure
channels
and
by
slow
degrees
we
were
to
proclaim
to
the
world
his
last
message
alwyn
eyes
rested
on
the
speaker
in
reverent
yet
anxious
inquiry
surely
he
said
you
will
begin
to
proclaim
it
now
yes
we
shall
begin
answered
heliobas
his
brow
darkening
as
with
a
cloud
of
troubled
thought
but
we
are
in
a
certain
difficulty
for
we
may
not
speak
in
public
ourselves
nor
write
for
publication
our
ancient
vow
binds
us
to
this
and
may
not
be
broken
moreover
the
master
gave
us
a
strange
command
namely
that
when
the
hour
came
for
the
gradual
declaration
of
the
secret
of
his
doctrine
we
should
intrust
it
in
the
first
place
to
the
hands
of
one
who
should
be
young
in
the
world
yet
not
of
it
simple
as
a
child
yet
wise
with
the
wisdom
of
faith
of
little
or
no
estimation
among
men
and
who
should
have
the
distinctive
quality
of
loving
nothing
in
earth
or
heaven
more
dearly
than
his
name
and
honor
for
this
unique
being
we
have
searched
and
are
searching
still
we
can
find
many
who
are
young
and
both
wise
and
innocent
but
alas
one
who
loves
the
unseen
christ
actually
more
than
all
things
this
is
indeed
a
perplexity
i
have
fancied
of
late
that
i
have
discovered
in
my
own
circle
that
is
among
those
who
have
been
drawn
to
study
god
and
nature
according
to
my
views
one
who
makes
swift
and
steady
progress
in
the
higher
sciences
and
who
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
trace
really
loves
our
master
with
singular
adoration
above
all
joys
on
earth
and
hopes
of
heaven
but
i
can
not
be
sure
and
there
are
many
tests
and
trials
to
be
gone
through
before
we
dare
bid
this
little
human
lamp
of
love
shine
forth
upon
the
raging
storm
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
went
on
in
a
low
tone
as
though
speaking
to
himself
when
the
mechanism
of
this
universe
is
explained
in
such
wise
that
no
discovery
of
science
can
ever
disprove
but
must
rather
support
it
when
the
essence
of
the
immortal
soul
in
man
is
described
in
clear
and
concise
language
and
when
the
marvellous
action
of
spirit
on
matter
is
shown
to
be
actually
existent
and
never
idle
then
if
the
world
still
doubts
and
denies
god
it
will
only
have
itself
to
blame
but
to
you
and
he
resumed
his
ordinary
tone
all
things
through
your
angel
love
are
made
more
or
less
plain
and
i
have
told
you
the
history
of
our
fraternity
merely
that
you
may
understand
how
it
is
we
know
so
much
that
the
outer
world
is
ignorant
of
there
are
very
few
of
us
left
nowadays
only
a
dozen
brotherhoods
scattered
far
apart
on
different
portions
of
the
earth
but
such
as
we
are
we
are
all
united
and
have
never
through
these
eighteen
hundred
years
had
a
shade
of
difference
in
opinion
concerning
the
divinity
of
christ
through
him
we
have
learned
true
spiritualism
and
all
the
miraculous
power
which
is
the
result
of
it
and
as
there
is
a
great
deal
of
false
spiritualism
rampant
just
now
i
may
as
well
give
you
a
few
hints
whereby
you
may
distinguish
it
at
once
imprimis
if
a
spiritualist
tells
you
that
he
can
summon
spirits
who
will
remove
tables
and
chairs
write
letters
play
the
piano
and
rap
on
the
walls
he
is
a
charlatan
for
spirits
can
touch
nothing
corporeal
unless
they
take
corporeal
shape
for
the
moment
as
in
the
case
of
your
angelic
edris
but
in
this
condition
they
are
only
seen
by
the
one
person
whom
they
visit
never
by
several
persons
at
once
remember
that
nor
can
they
keep
their
corporeal
state
long
except
by
their
express
wish
and
will
they
should
seek
to
enter
absolutely
into
the
life
of
humanity
which
i
must
tell
you
has
been
done
but
so
seldom
that
in
all
the
history
of
christian
spirituality
there
are
only
about
four
examples
here
are
six
tests
for
all
the
you
may
chance
to
meet
first
do
they
serve
themselves
more
than
others
if
so
they
are
entirely
lacking
in
spiritual
attributes
secondly
will
they
take
money
for
their
professed
knowledge
if
so
they
condemn
themselves
as
paid
tricksters
thirdly
are
they
men
and
women
of
commonplace
and
thoroughly
material
life
then
it
is
plain
they
can
not
influence
others
to
strive
for
a
higher
existence
fourthly
do
they
love
notoriety
if
they
do
the
gates
of
the
unseen
world
are
shut
upon
them
fifthly
do
they
disagree
among
themselves
and
speak
against
one
another
if
so
they
contradict
by
their
own
behavior
all
the
laws
of
spiritual
force
and
harmony
sixthly
and
do
they
reject
christ
if
they
do
they
know
nothing
whatever
about
spiritualism
there
being
none
without
him
again
when
you
observe
professing
psychists
living
in
any
eccentric
way
so
as
to
cause
their
trifling
actions
to
be
remarked
and
commented
upon
you
may
be
sure
the
real
power
is
not
in
them
as
for
instance
people
who
become
vegetarians
because
they
imagine
that
by
so
doing
they
will
see
spirits
people
who
adopt
a
singular
mode
of
dress
in
order
to
appear
different
from
their
people
who
are
lachrymose
dissatisfied
or
in
any
way
morbid
never
forget
that
true
spiritualism
engenders
health
of
body
and
mind
serenity
and
brightness
of
aspect
cheerfulness
and
perfect
contentment
and
that
its
influence
on
those
who
are
brought
within
its
radius
is
distinctly
marked
and
beneficial
the
chief
characteristic
of
a
true
that
is
christian
spiritualist
is
that
he
or
she
can
not
be
shaken
from
faith
or
thrown
into
despair
by
any
earthly
misfortune
whatsoever
and
while
on
this
subject
i
will
show
you
where
the
existing
forms
of
christianity
depart
from
the
teachings
of
christ
first
in
lack
of
self
abnegation
secondly
in
lack
of
unity
thirdly
in
failing
to
prove
to
the
multitude
that
death
is
is
not
destruction
but
simply
change
nothing
really
dies
and
the
priests
should
make
use
of
science
to
illustrate
this
fact
to
the
people
each
of
these
virtues
has
its
miracle
effect
unity
is
strength
self
abnegation
attracts
the
divine
influences
and
death
viewed
as
a
glorious
transformation
which
it
is
inspires
the
soul
with
a
sense
of
larger
life
sects
are
unchristian
there
should
be
only
one
vast
united
church
for
all
the
christian
world
a
church
whose
pure
doctrines
should
include
all
the
hints
received
from
nature
and
the
scientific
working
of
the
universe
the
marvels
of
the
stars
and
the
planetary
systems
the
wonders
of
plants
and
minerals
the
magic
of
light
and
color
and
music
and
the
true
miracles
of
spirit
and
matter
should
be
inquired
into
reverently
prayerfully
and
always
with
the
deepest
humility
while
the
first
act
of
worship
performed
every
holy
morn
and
eve
should
be
gratitude
gratitude
gratitude
ay
even
for
a
sorrow
we
should
be
thankful
it
may
conceal
a
blessing
we
wot
not
of
for
sight
for
sense
for
touch
for
the
natural
beauty
of
this
present
world
for
the
smile
on
a
face
we
love
for
the
dignity
and
responsibility
of
our
lives
and
the
immortality
with
which
we
are
endowed
oh
my
friend
would
that
every
breath
we
drew
could
in
some
way
express
to
the
all
loving
creator
our
adoring
recognition
of
his
countless
benefits
carried
away
by
his
inward
fervor
his
eyes
flashed
with
extraordinary
brilliancy
his
countenance
was
grand
inspired
and
beautiful
and
alwyn
gazed
at
him
in
wondering
fascinated
silence
here
was
a
man
who
had
indeed
made
the
best
of
his
manhood
what
a
life
was
his
how
satisfying
and
serene
master
of
himself
he
was
as
it
were
master
of
the
world
all
nature
ministered
to
him
and
the
pageant
of
passing
history
was
as
a
mere
brilliant
picture
painted
for
his
instruction
a
picture
on
which
he
looking
learned
all
that
it
was
needful
for
him
to
know
and
concerning
this
mystic
brotherhood
of
the
cross
and
star
what
treasures
of
wisdom
they
must
have
secreted
in
their
chronicles
through
so
many
thousands
of
years
what
a
privilege
it
would
be
to
explore
such
tracks
of
time
yielding
to
a
sudden
impulse
alwyn

replied
if
you

to
submit
to
fifteen
years
severe
trial
and

but
i
think
a
different
sphere
of
duty
is
designed

the
rules

the

such

constitute
liberty
laughed
heliobas
i
assure
you
i
am
closely
constrained
by
my
vows
wherever
i
am
as
closely
as
though
i
were
shut
in
our
turret
among
the
heights
of
caucasus
i
am
going
to
mexico
solely
to
receive
some
manuscripts
from
one
of
our
brethren
who
is
dying
there
he
has
lived
as
a
recluse
like
elzear
of
melyana
and
to
him
have
been
confided
certain
important
chronicles
which
must
be
taken
into
trustworthy
hands
for
preservation
such
is
the
object
of
my
journey
but
now
tell
me
have
you
thoroughly
understood
all
i
have
said
to
you
perfectly
rejoined
alwyn
my
way
seems
very
clear
before
me
a
happy
way
enough
too
if
it
were
not
quite
so
lonely
and
he
sighed
a
little
heliobas
rose
and
laid
one
hand
kindly
on
his
shoulder
courage
he
said
softly
bear
with
the
loneliness
a
while
it
may
not
last
long
a
slight
thrill
ran
through
alwyn
nerves
he
felt
as
though
he
were
on
the
giddy
verge
of
some
great
and
unexpected
joy
his
heart
beat
quickly
and
his
eyes
grew
dim
mastering
the
strange
emotion
with
an
effort
he
was
reluctantly
beginning
to
think
it
was
time
to
take
his
leave
when
heliobas
who
had
been
watching
him
intently
spoke
in
a
cheerful
friendly
tone
now
that
we
have
had
our
serious
talk
out
alwyn
suppose
you
come
with
me
and
hear
the
of
music
at
james
hall
will
you
he
can
bestow
upon
you
a
perfect
benediction
of
sweet
sound
a
benediction
not
to
be
despised
in
this
workaday
world
of
clamor
and
out
of
all
the
exquisite
symbols
of
heaven
offered
to
us
on
earth
music
i
think
is
the
grandest
and
best
i
will
go
with
you
wherever
you
please
replied
alwyn
glad
of
any
excuse
that
gave
him
more
of
the
attractive
chaldean
company
but
what
are
you
speaking
of
sarasate
or
sayty
as
some
of
the
clear
britishers
call
him
laughed
heliobas
putting
on
his
overcoat
as
he
spoke
the
fiddler
as
the
crabbed
musical
critics
define
him
when
they
want
to
be
contemptuous
which
they
do
pretty
often
these
together
with
the
literary
have
their
special
cliques
their
little
chalked
out
circles
in
which
they
like
tranced
geese
stand
cackling
unable
to
move
beyond
the
marked
narrow
limit
as
there
are
fools
to
be
found
who
have
the
ignorance
as
well
as
the
effrontery
to
declare
that
the
obfuscated
and
ephemeral
productions
of
browning
are
equal
if
not
superior
to
the
clear
majestic
matchless
and
immortal
utterances
of
shakespeare
ye
gods
the
force
of
asinine
braying
can
no
further
go
than
this
even
so
there
are
similar
fools
who
say
that
the
cold
correct
playing
of
joachim
is
superior
to
that
of
sarasate
but
come
and
judge
for
yourself
if
you
have
never
heard
him
it
will
be
a
sort
of
musical
revelation
to
you
he
is
not
so
much
a
violinist
as
a
human
violin
played
by
some
invisible
sprite
of
song
london
listens
to
him
but
does
know
quite
what
to
make
of
him
he
is
a
riddle
that
only
poets
can
read
if
we
start
now
we
shall
be
just
in
time
i
have
two
stalls
shall
we
go
alwyn
needed
no
second
invitation
he
was
passionately
fond
of
music
his
interest
was
aroused
his
curiosity
excited
moreover
whatever
the
fine
taste
of
heliobas
pronounced
as
good
must
he
felt
sure
be
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
left
the
hotel
together
and
were
walking
briskly
toward
piccadilly
their
singularly
handsome
faces
and
stately
figures
causing
many
a
to
glance
after
them
admiringly
and
murmur
sotto
voce
fellows
not
english
for
though
englishmen
are
second
to
none
in
mere
muscular
strength
and
symmetry
of
form
it
is
a
fact
worth
noting
that
if
any
one
possessing
poetic
distinction
of
look
or
picturesque
and
animated
grace
of
bearing
be
seen
suddenly
among
the
more
or
less
monotonously
uniform

in
the
streets
of
london
he
or
she
is
pretty
sure
to
be
set
down
rightly
or
wrongly

is
not
this
rather
a
pity

chapter
xxxviii
the
wizard
of
the
bow
when
they
entered
the
the
orchestra
had
already
begun
the
programme
of
the
day
with
mendelssohn
italian
symphony
the
house
was
crowded
to
excess
numbers
of
people
were
standing
apparently
willing
to
endure
a
whole
afternoon
fatigue
rather
than
miss
hearing
the
orpheus
of
andalusia
the
endymion
out
of
spain
as
one
of
our
latest
and
best
poets
has
aptly
called
him
only
a
languidly
tolerant
interest
was
shown
in
the
orchestral
performance
the
italian
symphony
is
not
a
really
great
or
suggestive
work
and
this
is
probably
the
reason
why
it
so
often
fails
to
arouse
popular
enthusiasm
for
be
it
understood
by
the
critical
elect
that
the
appreciation
of
the
million
is
by
no
means
so
vulgar
as
it
is
frequently
considered
it
is
the
impulsive
response
of
those
who
not
being
bound
hand
and
foot
by
any
special
fetters
of
thought
or
prejudice
express
what
they
instinctively
feel
to
be
true
you
can
not
force
these
vulgar
by
any
amount
of
societies
to
adopt
browning
as
a
household
god
but
they
will
appropriate
shakespeare
and
glory
in
him
too
without
any
one
compulsion
if
authors
painters
and
musicians
would
probe
more
earnestly
than
they
do
to
the
core
of
this
instinctive
higher
aspiration
of
peoples
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
their
future
fame
for
each
human
unit
in
a
nation
has
its
great
as
well
as
base
passions
and
it
is
the
clear
duty
of
all
the
votaries
of
art
to
appeal
to
and
support
the
noblest
side
of
nature
only
moreover
to
do
so
with
a
simple
unforced
yet
graphic
eloquence
of
meaning
that
can
be
grasped
equally
and
at
once
by
both
the
humble
and
exalted
it
is
not
in
the
least
italian
said
heliobas
alluding
to
the
symphony
when
it
was
concluded
and
the
buzz
of
conversation
surged
through
the
hall
like
the
noise
that
might
be
made
by
thousands
of
swarming
bees
there
is
not
a
breath
of
italian
air
or
a
glimpse
of
italian
light
about
it
the
dreamy
warmth
of
the
south
the
radiant
color
that
lies
all
day
and
all
night
on
the
lakes
and
mountains
of
dante
land
the
fragrance
of
flowers
the
snatches
of
peasants
and
fishermen
songs
the
tunefulness
of
nightingales
in
the
moonlight
the
tinkle
of
passing
mandolins
all
these
things
should
be
hinted
at
in
an
symphony
and
all
these
are
lacking
mendelssohn
tried
to
do
what
was
not
in
him
i
do
not
believe
the
nature
of
a
german
could
ever
understand
the
impetuously
passionate
soul
of
italy
as
he
spoke
a
fair
girl
with
gray
eyes
that
were
almost
black
glanced
round
at
him
inquiringly
a
faint
blush
flitted
over
her
cheeks
and
she
seemed
about
to
speak
but
as
though
restrained
by
timidity
she
looked
away
again
and
said
nothing
heliobas
smiled
that
pretty
child
is
italian
he
whispered
to
alwyn
patriotism
sparkled
in
those
bright
eyes
of
hers
love
for
the
land
of
lilies
from
which
she
is
at
present
one
transplanted
alwyn
smiled
also
assentingly
and
thought
how
gracious
kindly
and
gentle
were
the
look
and
voice
of
the
speaker
he
found
it
difficult
to
realize
that
this
man
who
now
sat
beside
him
in
the
stalls
of
a
fashionable
london
was
precisely
the
same
one
who
clad
in
the
long
flowing
white
robes
of
his
order
had
stood
before
the
altar
in
the
chapel
at
dariel
a
stately
embodiment
of
evangelical
authority
intoning
the
seven
glorias
it
seemed
strange
and
yet
not
strange
for
heliobas
was
a
personage
who
might
be
imagined
anywhere
by
the
bedside
of
a
dying
child
among
the
parliaments
of
the
learned
in
the
most
brilliant
social
assemblies
at
the
head
of
a
church
anything
he
chose
to
do
would
equally
become
him
inasmuch
as
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
depict
him
engaged
in
otherwise
than
good
and
noble
deeds
at
that
moment
a
tumultuous
clamor
of
applause
broke
out
on
all
sides
applause
that
was
joined
in
by
the
members
of
the
orchestra
as
well
as
the
audience
a
figure
emerged
from
a
side
door
on
the
left
and
ascended
the
platform
a
slight
agile
creature
with
rough
dark
hair
and
eager
passionate
eyes
no
other
than
the
hero
of
the
occasion
sarasate
himself
sarasate
e
il
suo
violino
there
they
were
the
two
companions
master
and
servant
king
and
subject
the
one
a
lithe
active
looking
man
of
handsome
somewhat
serious
countenance
and
absorbed
expression
the
other
a
mere
frame
of
wood
with
four
strings
deftly
knotted
across
it
in
which
cunningly
contrived
little
bit
of
mechanism
was
imprisoned
the
intangible
yet
living
spirit
of
sound
a
miracle
in
its
way
that
out
of
such
common
and
even
vile
materials
as
wood
catgut
and
horsehair
the
divinest
music
can
be
drawn
forth
by
the
hand
of
the
master
who
knows
how
to
use
these
rough
implements
suggestive
too
is
it
not
my
friends
for
if
man
can
by
his
own
poor
skill
and
limited
intelligence
so
invoke
spiritual
melody
by
material
means
shall
not
god
contrive
some
wondrous
tunefulness
for
himself
even
out
of
our
common
earthly
discord
hush
a
sound
sweet
and
far
as
the
chime
of
angelic
bells
in
some
vast
rang
clearly
through
the
hall
over
the
heads
of
the
now
hushed
and
attentive
audience
and
alwyn
hearing
the
penetrating
silveriness
of
those
first
notes
that
fell
from
bow
gave
a
quick
sigh
of
amazement
and
ecstasy
such
marvellous
purity
of
tone
was
intoxicating
to
his
senses
and
set
his
nerves
quivering
for
sheer
delight
in
sympathetic
tune
he
glanced
at
the
programme
concerto
beethoven
and
swift
as
a
flash
there
came
to
his
mind
some
lines
he
had
lately
read
and
learned
to
love
it
was
the
kaiser
of
the
land
of
song
the
giant
singer
who
did
storm
the
gates
of
heaven
and
hell
a
man
to
whom
the
fates
were
fierce
as
furies
and
who
suffered
wrong
and
ached
and
bore
it
and
was
brave
and
strong
and
grand
as
ocean
when
its
rage
abates
beethoven
musical
fullness
of
divine
light
how
the
glorious
nightingale
notes
of
his
unworded
poesy
came
dropping
through
the
air
like
pearls
rolling
off
the
magic
wand
of
the
violin
wizard
whose
delicate
dark
face
now
slightly
flushed
with
the
glow
of
inspiration
seemed
to
reflect
by
its
very
expression
the
various
phases
of
the
mighty
composer
thought
alwyn
half
closed
his
eyes
and
listened
entranced
allowing
his
soul
to
drift
like
an
oarless
boat
on
the
sweeping
waves
of
the
music
will
he
was
under
the
supreme
sway
of
two
emperors
of
art
beethoven
and
sarasate
and
he
was
content
to
follow
such
leaders
through
whatever
sweet
tangles
and
tall
growths
of
melody
they
might
devise
for
his
wandering
at
one
mad
passage
of
dancing
semitones
he
started
it
was
as
though
a
sudden
wind
dreaming
an
enraged
dream
had
leaped
up
to
shake
tall
trees
to
and
fro
and
the
pass
of
dariel
with
its
frozen
its
tottering
pines
and
howling
hurricanes
loomed
back
upon
his
imagination
as
he
had
seen
it
first
on
the
night
he
had
arrived
at
the
monastery
but
soon
these
wild
notes
sank
and
slept
again
in
the
dulcet
harmony
of
an
adagio
softer
than
a
lover
song
at
midnight
many
strange
suggestions
began
to
glimmer
through
this
same
adagio
the
fair
dead
face
of
niphrata
flitted
past
him
as
a
wandering
moonbeam
flits
athwart
a
cloud
then
came
flashing
reflections
of
light
and
color
the
bewildering
dazzlement
of
lysia
beauty
shone
before
the
eyes
of
his
memory
with
a
blinding
lustre
as
of
flame
the
phantasmagoria
of
the
city
of
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
like
a
faintly
discovered
mirage
ascending
from
the
sea
again
he
saw
its
picturesque
streets
its
domes
and
its
courts
and
again
he
heard
the
dreamy
melody
of
the
dance
that
had
followed
the
death
of
and
saw
the
cruel
lysia
wondrous
garden
lying
white
in
the
radiance
of
the
moon
anon
he
beheld
the
great
square
with
its
fallen
obelisk
and
the
prostrate
lifeless
form
of
the
prophet
and
oh
most
sad
and
dear
remembrance
of
all
the
cherished
shadow
of
himself
the
brilliant
the
joyous
appeared
to
beckon
him
from
the
other
side
of
some
vast
gulf
of
mist
and
darkness
with
a
smile
that
was
sorrowful
yet
persuasive
a
smile
that
seemed
to
say
o
friend
why
hast
thou
left
me
as
though
i
were
a
dead
thing
and
unworthy
of
regard
lo
i
have
never
died
here
an
abandoned
part
of
thee
ready
to
become
thine
inseparable
comrade
once
more
if
thou
make
but
the
slightest
sign
then
it
seemed
as
though
voices
whispered
in
his
ear
beloved
and
theos
theos
my
beloved
till
moved
by
a
vague
tremor
of
anxiety
he
lifted
his
drooping
eyelids
and
gazed
full
in
a
sort
of
amaze
at
the
musical
necromancer
who
had
conjured
up
all
these
apparitions
what
did
this
wonderful
sarasate
know
of
his
past
nothing
indeed
he
had
ceased
and
was
gravely
bowing
to
the
audience
in
response
to
the
thunder
of
applause
that
like
a
sudden
whirlwind
seemed
to
shake
the
building
but
he
had
not
quite
finished
his
incantations
the
last
part
of
the
concerto
was
yet
to
come
and
as
soon
as
the
hubbub
of
excitement
had
calmed
down
he
dashed
into
it
with
the
delicious
speed
and
joy
of
a
lark
soaring
into
the
springtide
air
and
now
on
all
sides
what
clear
showers
and
sparkling
coruscations
of
melody
what
a
broad
blue
sky
above
what
a
fair
green
earth
below
how
warm
and
odorous
this
radiating
space
made
resonant
with
the
ring
of
sweet
wild
thrills
of
ecstasy
and
tenderness
snatches
of
song
caught
up
from
the
meadows
and
set
to
float
in
echoing
liberty
through
the
azure
dome
of
heaven
and
in
all
and
above
all
the
light
and
heat
and
lustre
of
the
unclouded
sun
here
there
was
no
dreaming
possible
nothing
but
glad
life
glad
youth
glad
love
with
an
ambrosial
rush
of
tune
like
the
lark
descending
the
dancing
bow
cast
forth
the
final
chord
from
the
violin
as
though
it
were
a
diamond
flung
from
the
hand
of
a
king
a
flawless
jewel
of
pure
sound
and
the
minstrel
monarch
of
andalusia
serenely
saluting
the
now
wildly
enthusiastic
audience
left
the
platform
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
escape
so
soon
again
and
again
and
yet
again
the
enormous
crowd
summoned
him
before
them
for
the
mere
satisfaction
of
looking
at
his
slight
figure
his
dark
poetic
face
and
soft
eyes
as
though
anxious
to
convince
themselves
that
he
was
indeed
human
and
not
a
supernatural
being
as
his
marvellous
genius
seemed
to
indicate
when
at
last
he
had
retired
for
a
heliobas
turned
to
alwyn
with
the
question
what
do
you
think
of
him
think
of
him
echoed
alwyn
why
what
can
one
think
what
can
one
say
of
such
an
artist
he
is
like
a
grand
sunrise
baffling
all
description
and
all
criticism
heliobas
smiled
there
was
a
little
touch
of
satire
in
his
smile
do
you
see
that
gentleman
he
said
in
a
low
tone
pointing
out
by
a
gesture
a
pale
young
man
who
was
lounging
languidly
in
a
stall
not
very
far
from
where
they
themselves
sat
he
is
the
musical
critic
for
one
of
the
leading
london
daily
papers
he
has
not
stirred
an
inch
or
moved
an
eyelash
during
performance
and
the
violent
applause
of
the
audience
was
manifestly
distasteful
to
him
he
has
merely
written
one
line
down
in
his
it
is
most
probably
to
the
effect
that
the
fiddler
met
with
his
usual
success
at
the
hands
of
the
undiscriminating
public
alwyn
laughed
not
possible
and
he
eyed
the
impassive
individual
in
question
with
a
certain
compassionate
amusement
why
if
he
can
not
admire
such
a
magnificent
artist
as
sarasate
what
is
there
in
the
world
that
will
rouse
his
admiration
nothing
rejoined
heliobas
his
eyes
twinkling
humorously
as
he
spoke
nothing
unless
it
is
his
own
perspicuity
nil
admirari
is
the
critic
motto
the
modern
must
always
be
careful
to
impress
his
readers
in
the
first
place
with
his
personal
superiority
to
all
men
and
all
things
and
the
musical
oracle
yonder
will
no
doubt
be
clever
enough
to
make
his
report
of
sarasate
in
such
a
manner
as
to
suggest
the
idea
that
he
could
play
the
violin
much
better
himself
if
he
only
cared
to
try
ass
said
alwyn
under
his
breath
one
would
like
to
shake
him
out
of
his
absurd
heliobas
shrugged
his
shoulders
expressively
my
dear
fellow
he
would
only
bray
and
the
braying
of
an
ass
is
not
euphonious
no
you
might
as
well
shake
a
dry
and
expect
it
to
blossom
into
fruit
and
flower
as
argue
with
a
musical
critic
and
expect
him
to
be
enthusiastic
the
worst
of
it
is
these
men
are
not
really
musical
they
perhaps
know
a
little
of
the
grammar
and
technique
of
the
thing
but
they
can
not
understand
its
full
eloquence
in
the
presence
of
a
genius
like
pablo
de
sarasate
they
are
more
or
less
perplexed
it
is
as
though
you
ask
them
to
describe
in
set
cold
terms
the
counterpoint
and
thoroughbass
of
the
wind
symphony
to
the
trees
the
great
ocean
sonata
to
the
shore
or
the
delicate
madrigals
sung
almost
inaudibly
by
little
to
the
tinkling
fall
of
april
rain
the
man
is
too
great
for
them
he
is
a
blazing
star
that
dazzles
and
confounds
their
sight
and
after
the
manner
of
their
craft
they
abuse
what
they
ca
understand
music
is
distinctly
the
language
of
the
emotions
and
they
have
no
emotion
they
therefore
generally
prefer
joachim
the
good
stolid
joachim
who
so
delights
all
the
dreary
old
spinsters
and
dowagers
who
nod
over
their
at
the
popular
concerts
and
fancy
themselves
lovers
of
the
in
music
sarasate
appeals
to
those
who
have
loved
and
thought
and
suffered
those
who
have
climbed
the
heights
of
passion
and
wrung
out
the
depths
of
pain
and
therefore
the
people
taken
en
masse
as
for
instance
in
this
crowded
hall
instinctively
respond
to
his
magic
touch
and
why
because
the
greater
majority
of
human
beings
are
full
of
the
deepest
and
most
passionate
feelings
not
as
yet
having
been
out
of
them
here
the
orchestra
commenced
liszt
preludes
and
all
conversation
ceased
afterwards
sarasate
came
again
to
bestow
upon
his
eager
admirers
another
saving
grace
of
sound
in
the
shape
of
the
famous
mendelssohn
concerto
which
he
performed
with
such
fiery
ardor
tenderness
purity
of
tone
and
marvellous
execution
that
many
listeners
held
their
breath
for
sheer
amazement
and
delighted
awe
anything
approaching
the
beauty
of
his
rendering
of
the
final
allegro
alwyn
had
never
heard
and
indeed
it
is
probable
none
will
ever
hear
a
more
poetical
more
exquisite
singing
of
thought
than
this
matchless
example
of
sarasate
genius
and
power
who
would
not
warm
to
the
brightness
and
delicacy
of
those
delicious
rippling
tones
that
seemed
to
leap
from
the
strings
alive
like
sparks
of
fire
the
dainty
tripping
ease
of
the
arpeggi
that
float
from
the
bow
with
the
grace
of
rainbow
bubbles
blown
forth
upon
the
air
the
brilliant
runs
that
glide
and
glitter
up
and
down
like
chattering
brooks
sparkling
among
violets
and
the
lovely
softer
notes
that
here
and
there
sigh
between
the
varied
harmonies
with
the
dreamy
passion
of
lovers
who
part
only
to
meet
again
in
a
rush
of
eager
joy
alwyn
sat
absorbed
and
spellbound
he
forgot
the
passing
of
time
he
forgot
even
the
presence
of
heliobas
he
could
only
listen
and
gratefully
drink
in
every
drop
of
sweetness
that
was
so
lavishly
poured
upon
him
from
such
a
glorious
sky
of
sunlit
sound
presently
toward
the
end
of
the
performance
a
curious
thing
happened
sarasate
had
appeared
to
play
the
last
piece
set
down
for
him
a
composition
of
his
own
entitled
zigeunerweisen
a
gypsy
song
or
medley
of
gypsy
songs
it
would
be
thought
alwyn
glancing
at
his
programme
then
looking
towards
the
artist
who
stood
with
lifted
bow
like
another
prospero
prepared
to
summon
forth
the
ariel
of
music
at
a
touch
he
saw
that
the
dark
spanish
eyes
of
the
maestro
were
fixed
full
upon
him
with
as
he
then
fancied
a
strange
penetrating
smile
in
their
fiery
depths
one
and
a
weird
lament
came
sobbing
from
the
smitten
violin
a
wildly
beautiful
despair
was
wordlessly
proclaimed
a
melody
that
went
straight
to
the
heart
and
made
it
ache
and
burn
and
throb
with
a
rising
tumult
of
unlanguaged
passion
and
desire
the
solemn
yet
unfettered
grace
of
its
rhythmic
respiration
suggested
to
alwyn
first
darkness
then
twilight
then
the
gradual
of
a
silvery
dawn
till
out
of
the
shuddering
notes
there
seemed
to
grow
up
a
vague
vast
and
cool
whiteness
splendid
and
mystical
a
whiteness
that
from
shapeless
fleecy
mist
took
gradual
form
and
substance
the
great
with
its
closely
packed
throng
of
people
appeared
to
fade
away
like
vanishing
smoke
and
lo
before
the
poet
entranced
gaze
there
rose
up
a
wondrous
vision
of
stately
architectural
grandeur
a
vision
of
snowy
columns
and
lofty
arches
upon
which
fell
a
shimmering
play
of
radiant
color
flung
by
the
beams
of
the
sun
through
stained
glass
windows
glistening
a
tremulous
sound
of
voices
floated
aloft
singing
kyrie
eleison
kyrie
eleison
and
the
murmuring
undertone
of
the
organ
shook
the
still
air
with
deep
vibrations
of
holy
tune
everywhere
peace
everywhere
purity
everywhere
that
spacious
whiteness
flecked
with
of
royal
purple
gold
and
ardent
crimson
and
in
the
midst
of
all
o
dearest
tenderness
o
fairest
glory
a
face
shining
forth
like
a
star
in
a
cloud
a
face
dazzlingly
beautiful
and
sweet
a
golden
head
above
which
the
pale
halo
of
a
light
ethereal
hovered
lovingly
in
a
radiant
ring
edris
the
chaste
name
breathed
itself
silently
in
thoughts
silently
and
yet
with
all
the
passion
of
a
lover
prayer
how
was
it
he
wondered
dimly
that
he
saw
her
thus
distinctly
now
now
when
the
wept
its
wildest
tears
now
when
love
love
love
seemed
to
clamor
in
a
tempestuous
agony
of
appeal
from
the
low
pulsating
melody
of
the
marvellous
zigeunerweisen
a
melody
which
despite
its
name
had
revealed
to
one
listener
at
any
rate
nothing
concerning
the
wanderings
of
gypsies
over
forest
and
moorland
but
on
the
contrary
had
built
up
all
these
sublime
cathedral
arches
this
lustrous
light
this
exquisite
face
whose
loveliness
was
his
life
how
had
he
found
his
way
into
such
a
dream
sanctuary
of
frozen
snow
what
was
his
mission
there
and
why
when
the
picture
slowly
faded
did
it
still
haunt
his
memory
invitingly
persuasively
nay
almost
commandingly
he
could
not
tell
but
his
mind
was
entirely
ravished
and
possessed
by
an
absorbing
impression
of
white
sculptured
calm
and
he
was
as
startled
as
though
he
had
been
brusquely
awakened
from
a
deep
sleep
when
the
loud
plaudits
of
the
people
made
him
aware
that
sarasate
had
finished
his
programme
and
was
departing
from
the
scene
of
his
triumphs
the
frenzied
shouts
and
encores
however
brought
him
once
more
before
the
excited
public
to
play
a
set
of
spanish
dances
fanciful
and
delicate
as
the
gamboling
of
a
light
breeze
over
and
dashing
fountains
and
when
this
ceased
alwyn
woke
from
tranced
rapture
into
enthusiasm
and
joined
in
the
thunders
of
applause
with
fervent
warmth
and
zeal
eight
several
times
did
the
wearied
but
ever
affable
maestro
ascend
the
platform
to
bow
and
smile
his
graceful
acknowledgments
till
the
audience
satisfied
with
having
thoroughly
emphasized
their
hearty
appreciation
of
his
genius
permitted
him
to
finally
retire
then
the
people
flocked
out
of
the
hall
in
crowds
talking
laughing
and
delightedly
commenting
upon
the
afternoon
enjoyment
the
brief
remarks
exchanged
by
two
americans
who
were
sauntering
on
immediately
in
front
of
heliobas
and
alwyn
being
perhaps
the
very
pith
and
essence
of
the
universal
opinion
concerning
the
great
artist
they
had
just
heard
i
tell
you
what
he
is
said
one
he
a
oh
do
halve
it
rejoined
the
other
wittily
he
the
whole
thing
anyway
once
outside
the
hall
and
in
the
busy
street
now
rendered
doubly
brilliant
by
the
deep
saffron
light
of
a
gloriously
setting
sun
heliobas
prepared
to
take
leave
of
his
somewhat
silent
and
preoccupied
companion
i
see
you
are
still
under
the
sway
of
the
he
remarked
cheerfully
as
he
shook
hands
is
he
not
an
amazing
fellow
that
bow
of
his
is
a
veritable
it
finds
out
the
fountain
of
elusidis
footnote
a
miraculous
fountain
spoken
of
in
old
chronicles
whose
waters
rose
to
the
sound
of
music
and
the
music
ceasing
sank
again
in
each
human
heart
it
has
but
to
pronounce
a
note
and
straightway
the
hidden
waters
begin
to
bubble
but
do
forget
to
read
the
newspaper
accounts
of
this
concert
you
will
see
that
the
critics
will
make
no
allusion
whatever
to
the
enthusiasm
of
the
audience
and
that
the
numerous
encores
will
not
even
be
mentioned
that
is
unfair
said
alwyn
quickly
the
expression
of
the
appreciation
should
always
be
chronicled
of
course
but
it
never
is
unless
it
suits
the
immediate
taste
of
the
cliques
keep
all
three
things
on
a
low
ground
that
slopes
daily
more
and
more
toward
decadence
and
the
pity
of
it
is
that
the
english
get
judged
abroad
chiefly
by
what
their
own
journalists
say
of
them
thus
if
sarasate
is
coldly
criticised
foreigners
laugh
at
the
english
whereas
the
fact
is
that
the
nation
itself
is
not
unmusical
but
its
musical
critics
mostly
are
they
are
very
often
picked
out
of
the
rank
and
file
of
the
dullest
academy
students
and
contrapuntists
who
are
incapable
of
understanding
anything
original
and
therefore
are
the
persons
most
unfitted
to
form
a
correct
estimate
of
genius
however
it
has
always
been
so
and
i
suppose
it
always
will
be
so
do
you
remember
that
when
beethoven
began
his
grand
innovations
a
certain
wrote
of
him
absurdity
of
his
effort
is
only
equalled
by
the
hideousness
of
its
result
he
laughed
lightly
and
once
more
shook
hands
while
alwyn
looking
at
him
wistfully
said
i
wonder
when
we
shall
meet
again
oh
very
soon
i
dare
say
he
rejoined
the
world
is
a
wonderfully
small
place
after
all
as
men
find
when
they
jostle
up
against
each
other
unexpectedly
in
the
most
unlikely
corners
of
far
countries
you
may
if
you
choose
correspond
with
me
and
that
is
a
privilege
i
accord
to
few
i
assure
you
he
smiled
and
then
went
on
in
a
more
serious
tone
you
are
of
course
welcome
at
our
monastery
whenever
you
wish
to
come
but
take
my
advice
do
not
wilfully
step
out
of
the
sphere
in
which
you
are
placed
live
in
society
it
needs
men
of
your
stamp
and
intellectual
calibre
show
it
a
high
and
consistent
example
let
no
eccentricity
mar
your
daily
actions
work
at
your
destiny
steadily
cheerfully
serenely
and
leave
the
rest
to
god
and
the
angels
there
was
a
slight
tender
inflection
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
and
alwyn
gave
him
a
quick
searching
glance
but
his
blue
penetrating
eyes
were
calm
and
steadfast
full
of
their
usual
luminous
softness
and
pathos
and
there
was
nothing
expressed
in
them
but
the
gentlest
friendliness
well
i
glad
i
may
write
to
you
at
any
rate
said
alwyn
at
last
reluctantly
releasing
his
hand
it
is
possible
i
may
not
remain
long
in
london
i
want
to
finish
my
poem
and
it
gets
on
too
slowly
in
the
tumult
of
daily
life
in
town
then
will
you
go
abroad
again
inquired
heliobas
perhaps
i
may
bonn
where
i
was
once
a
student
for
a
time
it
is
a
peaceful
sleepy
little
place
i
shall
probably
complete
my
work
easily
there
moreover
it
will
be
like
going
back
to
a
bit
of
my
youth
i
remember
i
first
began
to
entertain
all
my
dreams
of
poesy
at
bonn
inspired
by
the
seven
mountains
and
the
drachenfels
laughed
heliobas
no
wonder
you
recalled
the
lost
period
in
the
sight
of
the
entrancing
rhine
ah
sir
poet
you
have
had
your
fill
of
fame
and
i
fear
the
plaudits
of
london
will
never
be
like
those
of
no
monarchs
will
honor
you
now
but
rather
despise
for
the
kings
and
queens
of
this
age
prefer
financiers
to
laureates
now
wherever
you
wander
let
me
hear
of
your
and
progress
in
contentment
when
you
write
address
to
our
dariel
retreat
for
though
on
my
return
from
mexico
i
shall
probably
visit
lemnos
my
letters
will
always
be
forwarded

adieu
and
their
eyes
met
a
grave
sweet
smile
brightened
the
chaldean

features
god
remain
with
you
my
friend
he
said
in
a
low
thrillingly
earnest
tone
believe
me
you
are
elected
to
a
strangely
happy
fate
far
happier
than
you
at
present
know
with
these
words
he
turned
and
was
gone
lost
to
sight
in
the
surging
throng
of
alwyn
looked
eagerly
after
him
but
saw
him
no
more
his
tall
figure
had
vanished
as
utterly
as
any
of
the
phantom
shapes
in
only
that
far
from
being
he
had
seemed
more
actually
a
living
personality
than
any
of
the
people
in
the
streets
who
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
on
their
various
errands
of
business
or
pleasure
that
same
night
when
alwyn
related
his
day
adventure
to
villiers
who
heard
it
with
the
most
absorbed
interest
he
was
describing
the
effect
of
sarasate
when
all
at
once
he
was
seized
by
the
same
curious
overpowering
impression
of
white
lofty
arches
stained
windows
and
glimmerings
of
color
and
he
suddenly
stopped
short
in
the
midst
of
his
narrative
what
the
matter
asked
villiers
astonished
go
on
you
were
saying
that
sarasate
is
one
of
the
divinest
of
god

on
alwyn
slowly
and
with
a
faint
smile
and
that
though
as
a
rule
musicians
are
forgotten
when
their
music
ceases
this
andalusian
orpheus
in

will
be
remembered
long
after
his
violin
is
laid
aside
and
he
himself
has
journeyed
to
a
sunnier
land
than
spain
but
i
am
not
master
of
my
thoughts
villiers
my
chaldean
friend
has
perhaps
mesmerized
me
who
knows
and
i
have
an
odd
fancy
upon
me
i
should
like
to
spend
an
hour
in
some
great
and
beautiful
cathedral
and
see
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
flashing
through
the
stained
windows
across
the

laughed
villiers
you
ca
gratify
that
whim
in
london
there
no

beautiful
edifice
of
the
kind
here
only
the
unfinished
oratory
westminster
abbey
broken
up
into
ugly
pews
and
vile
monuments
and
the
repellently
grimy
paul
so
go
to
bed
old
boy
and
indulge
yourself
in
some
more
for
i
assure
you
you
never
find
any
reality
come
up
to
your
ideal
of
things
in
general
no
and
alwyn
smiled
strange
that
i
see
it
in
quite
the
reverse
way
it
seems
to
me
no
ideal
will
ever
come
up
to
the
splendor
of
reality
but
remember
said
villiers
quickly
your
reality
is
heaven
a
that
is
every
one

myth
true
terribly
true
and
alwyn
eyes
darkened
sorrowfully
yet
the

myth
is
the
only
eternal
real

for
the
shadows
of
this
present
seeming

immortal

by
the
rhine
in
the
two
or
three
weeks
that
followed
his
meeting
with
heliobas
alwyn
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
london
for
a
while
he
was
tired
and
restless
tired
of
the
routine

more
or
less
imposed
upon
him
restless
because
he
had
come
to
a
standstill
in
his
work
an
invisible
barrier
over
which
his
creative
fancy
was
unable
to
take
its
usual
sweeping
flight
he
had
an
idea
of
seeking
some
quiet
spot
among
mountains
as
far
remote
as
possible
from
the
travelling
world
of
men
a
peaceful
place
where
with
the
majestic
silence
of
nature
all
about
him
he
might
plead
in
retirement
with
his
refractory
muse
and
strive
to
coax
her
into
a
sweeter
and
more
indulgent
humor
it
was
not
that
thoughts
were
lacking
to
him
what
he
complained
of
was
the
monotony
of
language
and
the
difficulty
of
finding
new
true
and
choice
forms
of
expression
a
great
thought
leaps
into
the
brain
like
a
lightning
flash
there
it
is
an
indescribable
mystery
warming
the
soul
and
pervading
the
intellect
but
the
proper
expression
of
that
thought
is
a
matter
of
the
deepest
anxiety
to
the
true
poet
who
if
he
be
worthy
of
his
vocation
is
bound
not
only
to
proclaim
it
to
the
world
clearly
but
also
clad
in
such
a
perfection
of
wording
that
it
shall
chime
on
men
ears
with
a
musical
sound
as
of
purest
golden
bells
there
are
very
few
faultless
examples
of
this
felicitous
utterance
in
english
or
in
any
literature
so
few
indeed
that
they
could
almost
all
be
included
in
one
newspaper
column
of
ordinary
print
keats
exquisite
line
aeea
isle
was
wondering
at
the
moon
in
which
the
word
wondering
paints
a
whole
landscape
of
dreamy
enchantment
and
the
couplet
in
the
ode
to
a
nightingale
that
speaks
with
a
delicious
vagueness
of
magic
casements
opening
on
the
foam
of
perilous
seas
in
faery
lands
forlorn
are
absolutely
unique
and
unrivalled
as
is
the
exquisite
alliteration
taken
from
a
poet
of
our
own
day
the
holy
lark
with
fire
from
heaven
and
sunlight
on
his
wing
who
wakes
the
world
with
witcheries
of
the
dark
renewed
in
rapture
in
the
reddening
air
again
from
the
same
the
chords
of
the
lute
are
entranced
with
the
weight
of
the
wonder
of
things
and
his
skyward
notes
have
drenched
the
summer
with
the
dews
of
song
this
last
line
being
certainly
one
of
the
most
suggestive
and
beautiful
in
all
poetical
literature
such
expressions
have
the
intrinsic
quality
of
completeness
once
said
we
feel
that
they
can
never
be
said
again
they
belong
to
the
centuries
rather
than
the
seasons
and
any
imitation
of
them
we
immediately
and
instinctively
resent
as
an
outrage
and
theos
alwyn
was
essentially
and
above
all
things
faithful
to
the
lofty
purpose
of
his
calling
he
dealt
with
his
art
reverently
and
not
in
rough
haste
and
scrambling
carelessness
if
he
worked
out
any
idea
in
rhyme
the
idea
was
distinct
and
the
rhyme
was
perfect
he
was
not
content
like
browning
to
jumble
together
such
hideous
and
ludicrous
combinations
as
high
humph
and
triumph
moreover
he
knew
that
what
he
had
to
tell
his
public
must
be
told
comprehensively
yet
grandly
with
all
the
authority
and
persuasiveness
of
incisive
rhetoric
yet
also
with
all
the
sweetness
and
fascination
of
a
passioned
occupied
with
such
work
as
this
london
with
its
myriad
mad
noises
and
vulgar
distractions
became
impossible
to
him
and
villiers
his
fidus
achates
who
had
read
portions
of
his
great
poem
and
was
impatient
to
see
it
finished
knowing
as
he
did
what
an
enormous
sensation
it
would
create
when
published
warmly
seconded
his
own
desire
to
gain
a
couple
of
months
complete
seclusion
and
tranquillity
he
left
town
therefore
about
the
middle
of
may
and
started
across
the
channel
resolving
to
make
for
switzerland
by
the
leisurely
and
delightful
way
of
the
rhine
in
order
to
visit
bonn
the
scene
of
his
old
student
days
what
days
they
had
been
days
of
dreaming
more
than
action
for
he
had
always
regarded
learning
as
a
pastime
rather
than
a
drudgery
and
so
had
easily
distanced
his
comrades
in
the
race
for
knowledge
while
they
were
flirting
with
the
lischen
or
gretchen
of
the
hour
he
had
willingly
absorbed
himself
in
study
thus
he
had
attained
the
head
of
his
classes
with
scarce
an
effort
and
in
fact
had
often
found
time
hanging
heavily
on
his
hands
for
want
of
something
more
to
do
he
had
astonished
the
university
professors
but
he
had
not
astonished
himself
inasmuch
as
no
special
branch
of
learning
presented
any
difficulties
to
him
and
the
more
he
mastered
the
more
dissatisfied
he
became
it
had
seemed
such
a
little
thing
to
win
the
honors
of
scholarship
for
at
that
time
his
ambition
was
always
climbing
up
the
apparently
inaccessible
heights
of
fame
fame
that
he
then
imagined
was
the
greatest
glory
any
human
being
could
aspire
to
he
smiled
as
he
recollected
this
and
thought
how
changed
he
was
since
then
what
a
difference
between
the
former
discontented
mutability
of
his
nature
and
the
deep
unswerving
calm
of
patience
that
characterized
it
now
learning
and
scholarship
these
were
the
mere
child
alphabet
of
things
and
fame
was
a
passing
breath
that
ruffled
for
one
brief
moment
the
flood
of
time
a
bubble
blown
in
the
air
to
break
into
nothingness
thus
much
wisdom
he
had
acquired
and
what
more
a
great
deal
more
he
had
won
the
difficult
comprehension
of
himself
he
had
grasped
the
priceless
knowledge
that
man
has
no
enemy
save
that
which
is
within
him
and
that
the
pride
of
a
rebellious
will
is
the
parent
sin
from
which
all
others
are
generated
the
old
scriptural
saying
is
true
for
all
time
that
through
pride
the
angels
fell
and
it
is
only
through
humility
that
they
will
ever
rise
again
pride
the
proud
will
that
is
left
free
by
divine
law
to
work
for
itself
and
answer
for
itself
and
wreak
upon
its
own
head
the
punishment
of
its
own
errors
the
will
that
once
voluntarily
crushed
down
in
the
dust
at
the
cross
of
christ
with
these
words
truly
drawn
from
the
depths
of
penitence
lord
not
as
i
will
but
as
thou
wilt
is
straightway
lifted
up
from
its
humiliation
a
supreme
stately
force
resistless
miraculous
smoothing
the
way
for
all
greatness
and
all
goodness
and
guiding
the
happy
soul
from
joy
to
joy
from
glory
to
glory
till
heaven
itself
is
reached
and
the
perfection
of
all
love
and
life
begins
for
true
humility
is
not
slavish
as
some
people
imagine
but
rather
royal
since
while
acknowledging
the
supremacy
of
god
it
claims
close
kindred
with
him
and
is
at
once
invested
with
all
the
diviner
virtues
fame
and
wealth
the
two
perishable
prizes
for
which
men
struggle
with
one
another
in
ceaseless
and
cruel
combat
bring
no
absolute
satisfaction
in
the
end
they
are
toys
that
please
for
a
time
and
then
grow
wearisome
but
the
conquering
of
self
is
a
battle
in
which
each
fresh
victory
bestows
a
deeper
content
a
larger
happiness
a
more
perfect
peace
and
neither
poverty
sickness
nor
misfortune
can
quench
the
courage
or
abate
the
ardor
of
the
warrior
who
is
absorbed
in
a
crusade
against
his
own
worser
passions
egotism
is
the
vice
of
this
age
the
maxim
of
modern
society
is
each
man
for
himself
and
no
one
for
his
neighbor
and
in
such
a
state
of
things
when
personal
interest
or
advantage
is
the
chief
boon
desired
we
can
not
look
for
honesty
in
either
religion
politics
or
commerce
nor
can
we
expect
any
grand
work
to
be
done
in
art
or
literature
when
pictures
are
painted
and
books
are
written
for
money
only
when
laborers
take
no
pleasure
in
labor
save
for
the
wage
it
brings
when
no
real
enthusiasm
is
shown
in
anything
except
the
accumulation
of
wealth
and
when
all
the
finer
sentiments
and
nobler
instincts
of
men
are
made
subject
to
mammon
worship
is
any
one
so
mad
and
blind
as
to
think
that
good
can
come
of
it
nothing
but
evil
upon
evil
can
accrue
from
such
a
system
and
those
who
have
prophetic
eyes
to
see
through
the
veil
of
events
can
perceive
even
now
the
not
far
distant
end
namely
the
ruin
of
the
country
that
has
permitted
itself
to
degenerate
into
a
mere
nation
of
shopkeepers
and
something
worse
than
ruin
degradation
it
was
past
eight
in
the
evening
when
alwyn
after
having
spent
a
couple
of
days
in
bright
little
brussels
arrived
at
cologne
most
travelers
know
to
their
cost
how
noisy
narrow
and
unattractive
are
the
streets
of
this
ancient
colonia
agrippina
of
the
romans
how
persistent
and
wearying
is
the
rattle
of
the
vehicles
over
the
rough
cobbly
stones
how
irritating
to
the
nerves
is
the
incessant
shrieking
whistle
and
clank
of
the
rhine
steamboats
as
they
glide
in
or
glide
out
from
the
cheerless
and
dirty
pier
but
at
night
when
these
unpleasant
sounds
have
partially
subsided
and
the
lights
twinkle
in
the
and
the
majestic
mass
of
the
cathedral
casts
its
broad
shadow
on
the
moonlit
and
a
few
soldiers
with
clanking
swords
and
glittering
spurs
come
marching
out
from
some
dark
stone
archway
and
the
green
gleam
of
the
river
sparkles
along
in
luminous
ripples
then
it
is
that
a
something
weird
and
mystical
creeps
over
the
town
and
the
glamour
of
ancient
historical
memories
begins
to
cling
about
its
irregular
buildings
one
thinks
of
the
legendary
three
kings
and
believes
in
them
too
of
ursula
and
her
company
of
virgins
of
marie
de
medicis
dying
alone
in
that
house
in
the
of
rubens
who
it
is
said
here
first
saw
the
light
of
this
world
of
an
angry
satan
flinging
his
teufelstein
from
the
seven
mountains
in
an
impotent
attempt
to
destroy
the
dom
and
gradually
the
indestructible
romantic
spell
of
the
rhine
steals
into
the
spirit
of
common
things
that
were
unlovely
by
day
and
makes
the
old
city
beautiful
under
the
sacred
glory
of
the
stars
alwyn
dined
at
his
hotel
and
then
finding
it
still
too
early
to
retire
to
rest
strolled
slowly
across
the
platz
looking
up
at
the
sublime
god
temple
above
him
the
stately
cathedral
with
its
wondrously
delicate
carvings
and
flying
buttresses
on
which
the
moonlight
glittered
like
little
points
of
pale
flame
he
knew
it
of
old
many
and
many
a
time
had
he
taken
train
from
bonn
for
the
sole
pleasure
of
spending
an
hour
in
gazing
on
that
splendid
sermon
in
stone
one
of
the
grandest
testimonies
in
the
world
of
instinctive
desire
to
acknowledge
and
honor
by
his
noblest
design
and
work
the
unseen
but
felt
majesty
of
the
creator
he
had
a
great
longing
to
enter
it
now
and
ascended
the
steps
with
that
intention
but
much
to
his
vexation
the
doors
were
shut
he
walked
from
the
side
to
the
principal
entrance
that
superb
western
frontage
which
is
so
cruelly
blocked
in
by
a
dwarfish
street
of
the
commonest
shops
and
meanest
houses
and
found
that
also
closed
against
him
disappointed
and
sorry
he
went
back
again
to
the
side
of
the
colossal
structure
and
stood
on
the
top
of
the
steps
close
to
the
central
barred
doors
studying
the
sculptured
saints
in
the
niches
and
feeling
a
sudden
singular
impression
of
extreme
loneliness
a
sense
of
being
shut
out
as
it
were
from
some
high
festival
in
which
he
would
gladly
have
taken
part
not
a
cloud
was
in
the
sky
the
evening
was
one
of
the
most
absolute
calm
and
a
delicious
warmth
pervaded
the
air
the
warmth
of
a
fully
declared
and
balmy
spring
the
platz
was
almost
deserted
only
a
few
persons
crossed
it
now
and
then
like
flitting
shadows
and
somewhere
down
in
one
of
the
opposite
streets
a
long
way
off
there
was
a
sound
of
men
voices
singing
a
presently
however
this
distant
music
ceased
and
a
deep
silence
followed
alwyn
still
remained
in
the
sombre
shade
of
the
cathedral
archway
arguing
with
himself
against
the
foolish
and
unaccountable
depression
that
had
seized
him
and
watching
the
brilliant
may
moon
soar
up
higher
and
higher
in
the
heavens
when
all
at
once
the
throbbing
murmur
of
the
great
organ
inside
the
dom
startled
him
from
pensive
dreaminess
into
swift
attention
he
listened
the
rich
round
notes
thundered
through
the
stillness
with
forceful
and
majestic
harmony
anon
wierd
tones
like
the
passionate
lament
of
sarasate
zigeunerweisen
floated
around
and
above
him
then
a
silvery
chorus
of
young
voices
broke
forth
in
solemn
unison
kyrie
eleison
christe
eleison
kyrie
eleison
a
faint
cold
tremor
crept
through
his
veins
his
heart
beat
violently
again
he
vainly
strove
to
open
the
great
door
was
there
a
choir
practising
inside
at
this
hour
of
the
night
surely
not
then
from
whence
had
this
music
its
origin
stooping
he
bent
his
ear
to
the
crevice
of
the
closed
portal
but
as
suddenly
as
they
had
begun
the
harmonies
ceased
and
all
was
once
more
profoundly
still
drawing
a
long
deep
breath
he
stood
for
a
moment
amazed
and
lost
in
thought
these
sounds
he
felt
sure
were
not
of
earth
but
of
heaven
they
had
the
same
ringing
sweetness
as
those
he
had
heard
on
the
field
of
ardath
what
might
they
mean
to
him
here
and
now
quick
as
a
flash
the
answer
came
death
god
had
taken
pity
upon
his
solitary
earth
wanderings
and
the
prayers
of
edris
had
shortened
his
and
probation
he
was
to
die
and
that
solemn
singing
was
the
warning
or
the
promise
of
his
approaching
end
yes
it
must
be
so
he
decided
as
with
a
strange
peace
at
his
heart
he
quietly
descended
the
steps
of
the
dom
would
perhaps
be
permitted
to
finish
the
work
he
was
at
present
doing
and
then
then
the
would
be
laid
aside
forever
chains
would
be
undone
and
he
would
be
set
at
liberty
such
was
his
fixed
idea
was
he
glad
of
the
prospect
he
asked
himself
yes
and
no
for
himself
he
was
glad
but
in
these
latter
days
he
had
come
to
understand
the
thousand
wordless
wants
and
aspirations
of
mankind
wants
and
aspirations
to
which
only
the
poet
can
give
fitting
speech
he
had
begun
to
see
how
much
can
be
done
to
cheer
and
raise
and
ennoble
the
world
by
even
one
true
brave
earnest
and
unselfish
worker
and
he
had
attained
to
such
a
height
in
sympathetic
comprehension
of
the
difficulties
and
drawbacks
of
others
that
he
had
ceased
to
consider
himself
at
all
in
the
question
either
with
regard
to
the
present
or
the
immortal
future
he
was
without
knowing
it
in
the
simple
unconsciously
perfect
attitude
of
a
soul
that
is
absolutely
at
one
with
god
and
that
thus
in
involuntary
is
only
happy
in
the
engendering
of
happiness
he
believed
that
with
the
divine
help
he
could
do
a
lasting
good
for
his
and
to
this
cause
he
was
willing
to
sacrifice
everything
that
pertained
to
his
own
mere
personal
advantage
but
now
now
or
so
he
imagined
he
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
pursue
his
labors
of
love
his
trial
was
to
end
suddenly
and
he
so
long
banished
from
his
higher
heritage
was
to
be
restored
to
it
without
delay
restored
and
drawn
back
to
the
land
of
perfect
loveliness
where
edris
his
angel
waited
for
him
his
saint
his
queen
his
bride
a
thrill
of
ecstatic
joy
rushed
through
him
joy
intermingled
with
an
almost
supernal
pain
for
he
had
not
as
yet
said
enough
to
the
world
the
world
of
many
afflictions
the
little
sorrowful
star
covered
with
toiling
anxious
deluded
millions
in
every
unit
of
which
was
a
spark
of
heavenly
flame
a
germ
of
the
spiritual
essence
that
makes
the
angel
if
only
fostered
aright
lost
in
a
deep
reverie
his
footsteps
had
led
him
unconsciously
to
the
rhine
bridge
paying
the
customary
fee
he
walked
about
across
it
and
stood
for
a
while
listening
to
the
incessant
swift
rush
of
the
river
beneath
him
lights
twinkled
from
the
boats
moored
on
either
side
the
moon
poured
down
a
wide
shower
of
white
beams
on
the
rapid
flood
the
city
dusky
and
crowned
with
the
majestic
towers
of
the
dom
looked
picturesquely
calm
and
grand
it
was
a
night
of
perfect
beauty
and
wondrous
peace
and
he
was
to
die
to
die
and
leave
all
this
the
present
fairness
of
the
world
he
was
to
depart
with
as
he
felt
his
message
half
unspoken
he
was
to
be
made
eternally
happy
while
many
of
the
thousands
he
left
behind
were
through
ignorance
wilfully
electing
to
be
eternally
miserable
a
great
almost
divine
longing
to
save
one
only
one
downward
drifting
soul
possessed
him
and
the
comprehension
of
christ
sacrifice
was
no
longer
a
mystery
yet
he
was
so
certain
that
death
sudden
and
speedy
closely
awaited
him
that
he
seemed
to
feel
it
in
the
very
air
not
like
a
coming
chill
of
dread
but
like
the
soft
approach
of
some
holy
seraph
bringing
benediction
it
mattered
little
to
him
that
he
was
actually
in
the
very
plenitude
of
health
and
strength
that
perhaps
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
felt
such
a
keen
delight
in
the
physical
perfection
of
his
manhood
as
now
death
without
warning
and
at
a
touch
could
smite
down
the
most
vigorous
and
to
be
so
smitten
he
believed
was
his
imminent
destiny
and
while
he
lingered
on
the
bridge
between
grief
and
joy
a
small
window
opened
in
a
quaint
house
that
bent
its
bulging
gables
crookedly
over
the
gleaming
water
and
a
girl
holding
a
small
lamp
looked
out
for
a
moment
her
face
fresh
and
smiling
was
fair
to
see
against
the
background
of
dense
shadow
the
light
she
carried
flashed
like
a
star
and
leaning
down
from
the
lattice
she
sang
half
mischievously
the
first
two
or
three
bars
of
the
old
du
du

said
a

voice
below
gute

a
light
laugh
and
the
window
closed
sleep
well
best

and
for
some
sad
souls
life
last
hope
a
and
sleep
well
poor
tired
world
for
whose
weary
inhabitants
oftentimes
the
greatest
blessing
is
sleep
sleep
well
but
the
sleep
implies
waking
to
a
morning
of
pleasure
or
sorrow
or
labor
that
is
only
lightened
by
love
love
love
divine
love
human
and
sweetest
love
of
all
for
us
as
christ
has
taught
when
both
divine
and
human
are
mingled
in
one
alwyn
glancing
up
at
the
clustering
stars
hanging
like
pendent
above
him
thought
of
this
of
love
this
celestial
visitant
who
on
noiseless
pinions
comes
flying
divinely
into
the
poorest
homes
transfiguring
common
life
with
ethereal
radiance
making
toil
easy
giving
beauty
to
the
plainest
faces
and
poetry
to
the
dullest
brains
love
its
tremulous
its
rapturous
kiss
the
speechless
eloquence
it
gives
to
gentle
eyes
the
grace
it
bestows
on
even
the
smallest
gift
from
lover
to
beloved
were
such
gift
but
a
handful
of
meadow
blossoms
tied
with
some
silken
threads
of
hair
not
for
the
poet
creator
of
nourhulma
such
love
any
more
had
he
not
drained
the
cup
of
passion
to
the
dregs
in
the
far
past
and
tasted
its
mixed
sweetness
and
bitterness
to
no
purpose
save
all
that
was
over
and
yet
as
he
walked
away
from
the
bridge
back
to
his
hotel
in
the
quiet
moonlight
he
thought
what
a
transcendent
thing
love
might
be
even
on
earth
between
two
whose
spirits
were
spiritually
akin
whose
lives
were
like
two
notes
played
in
tuneful
concord
whose
hearts
beat
echoing
faith
and
tenderness
to
one
another
and
who
held
their
love
as
a
sacred
bond
of
union
a
gift
from
god
not
to
be
despoiled
by
that
rough
familiarity
which
surely
brings
contempt
and
then
before
his
fancy
appeared
to
float
the
radiant
visage
of
edris
he
seemed
to
see
her
beautiful
eyes
so
pure
so
clear
so
unshadowed
by
any
knowledge
of
sin
and
the
exquisite
lines
of
a
whose
work
he
specially
admired
occurred
to
him
with
singular
suggestiveness
oh
confess
that
love
from
man
to
maid
is
more
than
kingdoms
more
than
light
and
shade
in
gardens
where
the
minstrels
dwell
and
more
than
ransom
from
the
bonds
of
hell
thou
wilt
i
say
admit
the
truth
of
this
and
half
relent
that
shrinking
from
a
kiss
thou
didst
consign
me
to
mine
own
disdain
athwart
the
raptures
of
a
vision
bliss
i
seek
no
joy
that
is
not
linked
with
thine
no
touch
of
hope
no
taste
of
holy
wine
and
after
death
no
home
in
any
star
that
is
not
shared
by
thee
supreme
afar
as
here
first
and
foremost
of
all
things
glory
is
thine
and
gladness
and
the
wings
that
wait
on
thought
when
in
thy
thou
dost
invest
a
realm
unknown
to
kings
had
not
she
edris
consigned
him
to
his
own
disdain
athwart
the
raptures
of
a
visioned
bliss
ay
truly
and
deservedly
and
this
disdain
of
himself
had
now
reached
its
culminating
point
namely
that
he
did
not
consider
himself
worthy
of
her
love
or
worthy
to
do
aught
than
sink
again
into
far
spaces
of
darkness
and
perpetually
retrospective
memory
there
to
explore
the
uttermost
depths
of
anguish
and
count
up
his
errors
one
by
one
from
the
very
beginning
of
life
in
every
separate
phase
he
had
passed
through
till
he
had
penitently
striven
his
best
to
atone
for
them
all
christ
had
atoned
yes
but
was
it
not
almost
base
on
his
part
to
shield
himself
with
that
divine
light
and
do
nothing
further
he
could
not
yet
thoroughly
grasp
the
amazing
truth
that
one
absolutely
pure
act
of
faith
in
christ
blots
out
past
sin
forever
it
seemed
too
marvellous
and
great
a
boon
when
he
retired
to
rest
that
night
he
was
fully
and
firmly
prepared
to
die
with
this
expectation
upon
him
he
was
nevertheless
happy
and
tranquil
the
line
glory
is
thine
and
gladness
and
the
wings
haunted
him
and
he
repeated
it
over
and
over
again
without
knowing
why
wings
the
brilliant
shafts
of
radiance
that
part
angels
from
mortals
wings
that
after
all
are
not
really
wings
but
lambent
rays
of
living
lightning
of
which
neither
painter
nor
poet
has
any
true
conception
long
dazzling
rays
such
as
encircled
maiden
edris
with
an
arch
of
roseate
effulgence
so
that
the
very
air
was
in
the
splendor
of
her
presence
how
if
she
were
a
wingless
angel
made
woman
glory
is
thine
and
gladness
and
the
wings
and
with
the
name
of
his
upon
his
lips
he
closed
his
eyes
and
sank
into
a
deep
and
dreamless
slumber
chapter

in
the
cathedral
a
booming
thunderous
yet
mellow
sound
a
grand
solemn
sonorous
swing

and

you

and

gravely
persistent
sublimely
eloquent
the
huge
sustained
and
heavy
monotone
went
thudding
through
the
stillness
till
startled
from
his
profound
sleep
by
such
loud
lofty
and
incessant
clangor
alwyn
turned
on
his
pillow
and
listened
then
remembering
where
he
was
he
understood
it
was
the
great
bell
of
the
dom
pealing
forth
its
first
summons
to
the
earliest
mass
he
lay
quiet
for
a
little
while
dreamily
counting
the
number
of
reverberations
each
separate
stroke
sent
quivering
on
the
air
but
presently
finding
it
impossible
to
sleep
again
he
got
up
and
drawing
aside
the
curtain
looked
out
of
the
window
of
his
room
which
fronted
on
the
platz
though
it
was
not
yet
six
the
city
was
all
astir
the
rhinelanders
are
an
early
working
people
and
to
see
the
sun
rise
is
not
with
them
a
mere
fiction
of
poesy
but
a
daily
fact
it
was
one
of
the
loveliest
of
lovely
spring
mornings
the
sky
was
clear
as
a
pale
polished
sapphire
and
every
little
bib
of
delicate
carving
and
sculpture
on
the
dom
stood
out
from
its
groundwork
with
microscopically
beautiful
distinctness
and
as
his
gaze
rested
on
the
perfect
fairness
of
the
day
a
strange
and
sudden
sense
of
rapturous
anticipation
possessed
his
mind
he
felt
as
one
prepared
for
some
high
and
exquisite
happiness
some
great
and
wondrous
celebration
or
feast
of
joy
the
thoughts
of
death
on
which
he
had
brooded
so
persistently
during
the
past
had
fled
leaving
no
trace
behind
only
a
keen
and
vigorous
delight
in
life
absorbed
him
now
it
was
good
to
be
alive
even
on
this
present
earth
it
was
good
to
see
to
feel
to
know
and
there
was
much
to
be
thankful
for
in
the
mere
capability
of
easy
and
healthful
breathing
full
of
a
singular
he
hummed
a
soft
tune
to
himself
as
he
moved
about
his
room
his
desire
to
view
the
interior
of
the
cathedral
had
not
abated
with
sleep
but
had
rather
augmented
and
he
resolved
to
visit
it
now
while
he
had
the
chance
of
beholding
it
in
all
the
impressive
splendor
of
uncrowded
tranquillity
for
he
knew
that
by
the
time
he
was
dressed
the
first
mass
would
be
over
the
priests
and
people
would
be
gone
and
he
would
be
alone
to
enjoy
the
magnificence
of
the
place
in
full
the
luxury
of
silence
and
solitude
he
attired
himself
quickly
and
with
a
vaguely
nervous
eagerness
he
was
in
almost
as
great
a
hurry
to
enter
the
dom
as
he
had
been
to
arrive
at
the
field
of
ardath
the
same
feverish
impatience
was
upon
him
impatience
that
he
was
conscious
of
yet
could
not
account
for
his
fancy
busied
itself
with
a
whole
host
of
memories
and
fragments
of
he
had
written
in
his
youth
came
back
to
him
without
his
wish
or
will
songs
that
he
instinctively
felt
belonged
to
his
past
when
as
he
had
won
golden
opinions
in
and
though
they
were
but
echoes
they
seemed
this
morning
to
touch
him
with
suggestiveness
two
lines
especially
from
the
idyl
of
roses
he
had
penned
so
long
ah
so
very
long
ago
came
floating
through
his
brain
like
a
message
sent
from
some
other
world
by
the
pureness
of
love
shall
our
glory
in
loving
increase
and
the
roses
of
passion
for
us
are
the
lilies
of
peace
the
lilies
of
peace
and
the
flowers
of
ardath
the
roses
of
passion
and
the
love
of
edris
these
were
all
mingled
almost
unconsciously
in
his
thoughts
as
with
an
inexplicable
happy
sense
of
tremulous
expectation
expectation
of
he
knew
not
went
walking
as
one
in
haste
across
the
broad
platz
and
ascended
the
steps
of
the
cathedral
but
the
was
fast
shut
as
on
the
previous
night
he
therefore
made
his
rapid
way
round
to
the
great
western
door
that
stood
open
the
bell
had
long
ago
ceased
mass
was
over
and
all
was
profoundly
still
out
of
the
warm
sunlit
air
he
stepped
into
the
vast
cool
white
glory
of
the
stately
shrine
with
bared
head
and
noiseless
reverent
feet
he
advanced
a
little
way
up
the
nave
and
then
stood
motionless
every
artistic
perception
in
him
satisfied
soothed
and
entranced
anew
as
in
his
by
the
tranquil
grandeur
of
the
scene
what
majestic
silence
what
hallowed
peace
how
the
radiance
of
the
sun
pouring
through
the
rich
stained
glass
on
those
superb
carved
pillars
that
like
petrified
stems
of
bear
lightly
up
the
lofty
vaulted
roof
to
that
vast
height
suggestive
of
a
white
sky
rather
than
stone
moving
on
slowly
further
toward
the
altar
he
was
suddenly
seized
by
an
overpowering
impression
a
memory
that
rushed
upon
him
with
a
sort
of
shock
albeit
it
was
only
the
memory
of
a
tune
a
wild
melody
haunting
and
passionate
rang
in
his
eras
the
melody
that
sarasate
the
orpheus
of
spain
had
evoked
from
the
heart
of
his
speaking
violin
the
sobbing
of
the
zigeunerweisen
the
weird
that
had
so
forcibly
suggested
what
this
very
place
these
snowy
columns
this
sculptured
sanctity
this
flashing
light
of
rose
and
blue
and
amber
this
wondrous
hush
of
consecrated
calm
what
next
dear
god
sweet
christ
what
next
the
face
of
edris
would
that
heavenly
countenance
shine
suddenly
though
those
beams
that
struck
slantwise
down
toward
him
and
should
he
presently
hear
her
dulcet
voice
charming
the
silence
into
deeper
ecstasy
overcome
by
a
sensation
that
was
something
like
fear
he
stopped
abruptly
and
leaning
against
one
of
the
quaint
old
oaken
benches
strove
to
control
the
quick
excited
throbbing
of
his
heart
then
gradually
very
gradually
he
become
conscious
that
he
was
not
alone
another
besides
himself
was
in
the
church
another
whom
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
see
he
could
not
tell
how
he
first
grew
to
be
certain
of
this
but
he
was
soon
so
completely
possessed
by
the
idea
that
for
a
moment
he
dared
not
raise
his
eyes
or
move
some
invincible
force
held
him
there
yet
trembling
in
every
limb
and
while
he
thus
waited
hesitatingly
the
great
organ
woke
up
in
a
glory
of
tuneful
utterance
wave
after
wave
of
richest
harmony
rolled
through
the
stately
aisles
and
kyrie
eleison
kyrie
eleison
rang
forth
in
loud
full
and
chorus
lifting
his
head
he
stared
wonderingly
around
him
not
a
living
creature
was
visible
in
all
the
spacious
width
and
length
of
the
cathedral
his
lips
parted
he
felt
as
though
he
could
scarcely
breathe
strong
shudders
ran
through
him
and
he
was
penetrated
by
a
pleasing
terror
that
was
almost
a
physical
pang
an
agonized
entrancement
like
death
or
the
desire
of
love
presently
mastering
himself
by
a
determined
effort
he
advanced
steadily
with
the
absorbed
air
of
one
who
is
drawn
along
by
magnetic
power
steadily
and
slowly
up
the
nave
and
as
he
went
the
music
surged
more
tumultuously
among
the
vaulted
arches
there
was
a
faint
echo
afar
off
as
of
tinkling
crystal
bells
and
at
each
onward
step
he
gained
a
new
access
of
courage
strength
firmness
and
untrammelled
ease
till
every
timorous
doubt
and
fear
had
fled
away
and
he
stood
directly
in
front
of
the
altar
railing
gazing
at
the
enshrined
cross
and
seeing
for
the
moment
nothing
save
that
divine
symbol
alone
and
still
the
organ
played
and
still
the
voices
sang
he
knew
these
sounds
were
not
of
earth
and
he
also
knew
that
they
were
intended
to
convey
a
meaning
to
him
but
what
meaning
all
at
once
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
he
turned
toward
the
right
hand
side
of
the
altar
where
the
great
statue
of
christopher
stands
and
where
one
of
the
loveliest
windows
in
the
world
gleams
like
a
great
carven
gem
aloft
filtering
the
light
through
a
myriad
marvellous
shades
of
color
and
there
he
beheld
kneeling
on
the
stone
pavement
one
solitary
worshipper
a
girl
her
hands
were
clasped
and
her
face
was
bent
upon
them
so
that
her
features
were
not
visible
but
the
radiance
from
the
window
fell
on
her
uncovered
golden
hair
encircling
it
with
the
glistening
splendor
of
a
heavenly
nimbus
and
round
her
slight
devotional
figure
rays
of
azure
and
rose
jasper
and
emerald
flickered
in
wide
and
lustrous
patterns
like
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
on
a
translucent
sea
how
very
still
she
was
how
fervently
absorbed
in
prayer
vaguely
startled
and
thrilled
by
an
electric
indefinable
instinct
alwyn
went
toward
her
with
hushed
and
reverential
tread
his
eyes
dwelling
upon
the
drooping
delicate
outline
of
her
form
with
fascinated
and
eager
attention
she
was
clad
in
gray
a
soft
silken
gray
that
clung
about
her
in
picturesque
daintily
draped
folds
he
approached
her
still
more
nearly
and
then
could
scarcely
refrain
from
a
loud
cry
of
amazement
what
flowers
were
those
she
wore
at
her
breast
so
white
so
so
suggestive
of
paradise
lilies
were
they
not
the
flowers
of
ardath
dizzy
with
the
sudden
tumult
of
his
own
emotions
he
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
her
she
did
not
stir
was
she
real
or
a
phantom
trembling
violently
he
touched
her
garment
it
was
of
tangible
smooth
texture
actual
enough
if
the
sense
of
touch
could
be
relied
upon
in
an
agony
of
excitement
and
suspense
he
lost
all
remembrance
of
time
place
or
custom
her
bewildering
presence
must
be
explained
he
must
know
who
she
was
he
must
speak
to
her
speak
if
he
died
for
it
pardon
me
he
whispered
faintly
scarcely
conscious
of
his
own
words
i
fancy
i
think
we
have
met
before
may
i
dare
i
ask
your
name
slowly
she
unclasped
her
gently
folded
hands
slowly
very
slowly
she
lifted
her
bent
head
and
smiled
at
him
oh
the
lovely
light
upon
her
face
oh
the
angel
glory
of
those
strange
sweet
eyes
my
name
is
edris
she
said
and
as
the
pure
tone
of
her
voice
smote
the
air
with
its
silvery
sound
the
mysterious
music
of
the
organ
and
the
invisible
singers
throbbed
away
away
away
into
softer
and
softer
echoes
that
died
at
last
tremulously
and
with
a
sigh
as
of
farewell
into
the
deepest
silence
edris
in
a
trance
of
passionate
awe
and
rapture
he
caught
her
hand
the
warm
delicate
hand
that
yielded
to
his
strong
clasp
in
submissive
tenderness
pulsations
of
terror
pain
and
wild
joy
all
commingled
rushed
through
him
with
adoring
wistful
gaze
he
scanned
every
feature
of
that
countenance
a
countenance
no
longer
lustrous
with
heaven
blinding
glory
but
only
most
and
innocently
fair
dazzled
perplexed
and
half
afraid
he
could
not
at
once
grasp
the
true
comprehension
of
his
ineffable
delight
he
had
no
doubt
of
her
identity
he
knew
her
well
she
was
his
own
heartworshipped
angel
but
on
what
errand
had
she
wandered
out
of
paradise
had
she
come
once
more
as
on
the
field
of
ardath
to
comfort
him
for
a
brief
space
with
the
beauty
of
her
visible
existence
or
did
she
bring
from
heaven
the
warrant
for
his
death
edris
he
said
as
softly
as
one
may
murmur
a
prayer
edris
my
life
my
love
speak
to
me
again
make
me
sure
that
i
am
not
dreaming
tell
me
where
i
have
failed
in
my
sworn
faith
since
we
parted
teach
me
how
i
must
still
further
atone
is
this
the
hour
appointed
for
my
spirit
ransom
has
this
dear
and
sacred
hand
i
hold
brought
me
my
quittance
of
earth
and
have
i
so
soon
won
the
privilege
to
die
as
he
spoke
she
rose
and
stood
erect
with
all
the
glistening
light
of
the
stained
window
falling
royally
about
her
and
he
obeying
her
mute
gesture
rose
also
and
faced
her
in
wondering
ecstasy
half
expecting
to
see
her
vanish
suddenly
in
the
that
poured
through
the
cathedral
even
as
she
had
vanished
before
like
a
white
cloud
absorbed
in
clear
space
but
no
she
remained
quiet
as
a
tame
bird
her
eyes
met
his
with
beautiful
trust
and
tenderness
and
when
she
answered
him
her
low
sweet
accents
thrilled
to
his
heart
with
a
pathetic
note
of
human
affection
as
well
as
of
angelic
sympathy
theos
my
beloved
i
am
all
thine
she
said
a
holy
rapture
vibrating
through
her
exquisite
thine
now
in
mortal
life
as
in
immortal
one
with
thee
in
nature
and
condition
pent
up
in
perishable
clay
even
as
thou
art
subject
to
sorrow
and
pain
and
weariness
willing
to
share
with
thee
thine
earthly
lot
ready
to
take
my
part
in
thy
grief
or
joy
by
mine
own
choice
have
i
come
hither
sinless
yet
not
exempt
from
sin
but
safe
in
christ
every
time
thou
hast
renounced
the
desire
of
thine
own
happiness
so
much
the
nearer
hast
thou
drawn
me
to
thee
every
time
thou
hast
prayed
god
for
my
peace
rather
than
thine
own
so
much
the
closer
has
my
existence
been
linked
with
thine
and
now
o
my
poet
my
lord
my
king
we
are
together
forever
more
together
in
the
brief
present
as
in
the
eternal
future
the
solitary
of
edris
are
past
and
her
mission
is
not
death
but
love
oh
the
transcendent
beauty
of
that
warm
flush
upon
her
face
the
splendid
hope
faith
and
triumph
of
her
attitude
what
strange
miracle
was
here
accomplished
an
angel
had
become
human
for
the
sake
of
love
even
as
light
substantiates
itself
in
the
colors
of
flowers
the
eden
lily
had
consented
to
be
gathered
the
paradise
dove
had
fluttered
down
to
earth
breathless
bewildered
lifted
to
a
height
of
transport
beyond
all
words
alwyn
gazed
upon
her
in
entranced
devout
silence
the
vast
cathedral
seemed
to
swing
round
and
round
in
great
glittering
circles
and
nothing
was
real
nothing
steadfast
but
that
slight
sweet
maiden
in
her
soft
gray
robes
with
the
gleaming
white
against
her
breast
angel
she
was
angel
she
ever
would
be
and
yet
what
did
she
seem
naught
but
a
woman
wise
and
very
fair
crowned
with
the
garland
of
her
golden
hair
this
and
no
more
and
yet
in
this
was
all
earth
and
all
heaven
comprised
he
gazed
and
gazed
overwhelmed
by
the
amazement
of
his
own
bliss
he
could
have
gazed
upon
her
so
in
speechless
ravishment
for
hours
when
with
a
gesture
of
infinite
grace
and
appeal
she
stretched
out
her
hands
toward
him
speak
to
me
dearest
one
she
murmured
wistfully
tell
me
am
i
welcome
o
exquisite
humility
o
beautiful
hesitation
was
she
even
she
god
angel
so
far
removed
from
pride
as
to
be
uncertain
of
her
lover
reception
of
such
a
gift
of
love
roused
from
his
sense
of
wonder
he
caught
those
gentle
hands
and
laid
them
tenderly
against
his
breast
tremblingly
and
all
devoutly
he
drew
the
lovely
yielding
form
into
his
arms
close
to
his
heart
with
dazzled
sight
he
gazed
down
into
that
pure
perfect
face
those
clear
and
holy
eyes
shining
like
stars
beneath
the
soft
cloud
of
clustering
fair
hair
welcome
he
echoed
in
a
tone
that
thrilled
with
passionate
awe
and
ecstasy
my
edris
my
saint
my
queen
welcome
more
welcome
than
the
first
flowers
seen
after
winter
snows
welcome
more
welcome
than
swift
rescue
to
one
in
dire
peril
welcome
my
angel
into
the
darkness
of
mortal
things
which
haply
so
sweet
a
presence
shall
make
bright
o
sacred
innocence
that
i
am
not
worthy
to
shield
o
sinless
beauty
that
i
am
all
unfitted
to
claim
or
possess
welcome
to
my
life
my
heart
my
soul
welcome
sweet
trust
sweet
hope
sweet
love
that
as
christ
lives
i
will
never
wrong
betray
or
resign
again
through
all
the
glory
spaces
of
far
eternity
as
he
spoke
his
arms
closed
more
surely
about
her
his
lips
met
hers
and
in
the
mingled
human
and
divine
rapture
of
that
moment
there
came
a
rushing
noise
as
of
thousands
of
wings
beating
the
air
followed
by
a
mighty
wave
of
music
that
rolled
approachingly
and
then
departingly
through
and
through
the
cathedral
arches
and
a
voice
clear
and
resonant
as
a
silver
clarion
proclaimed
aloud
those
whom
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
then
with
a
surging
jubilant
sound
like
the
sea
in
a
storm
the
music
seemed
to
tread
past
in
a
measured
march
of
stately
harmony
and
presently
there
was
silence
once
more
the
silence
and
sunshine
of
the
morning
pouring
through
the
rose
windows
of
the
church
and
sparkling
on
the
cross
above
the
altar
the
silence
of
a
love
made
perfect
of
twin
souls
made
one
and
then
edris
drew
herself
gently
from
her
lover
embrace
and
raised
her
head
putting
her
hand
confidingly
in
his
a
lovely
smile
played
on
her
sweetly
parted
lips
take
me
theos
she
said
softly
lead
me
into
the
world
slowly
the
great
of
the
cathedral
swung
back
on
their
hinges
and
out
on
the
steps
in
a
glorious
blaze
of
sunlight
came
poet
and
angel
together
the
one
a
man
in
the
full
prime
of
splendid
and
vigorous
manhood
the
other
a
maiden
timid
and
sweet
robed
in
gray
attire
with
a
posy
of
white
flowers
at
her
throat
a
simple
girl
and
most
distinctly
human
the
fresh
pure
color
reddened
in
her
cheeks
the
soft
springtide
wind
fanned
her
gold
hair
and
the
sunbeams
seemed
to
dance
about
her
in
a
bright
revel
of
amaze
and
curiosity
her
lustrous
eyes
dwelt
on
the
busy
platz
below
with
a
vaguely
compassionate
wonder
a
look
that
suggested
some
far
foreknowledge
of
things
that
at
the
same
time
were
strangely
unfamiliar
hand
in
hand
with
her
companion
she
stood
while
he
holding
her
fast
drunk
in
the
pureness
of
her
beauty
the
of
her
glance
the
holy
radiance
of
her
smile
till
every
sense
in
him
was
spiritualized
anew
by
the
passionate
faith
and
reverence
in
his
heart
the
marvellous
glory
that
had
fallen
upon
his
life
the
nameless
rapture
that
possessed
his
soul
to
have
knelt
at
her
feet
and
bowed
his
head
before
her
in
worshipping
silence
would
have
been
to
follow
the
strongest
impulse
in
him
but
she
had
given
him
a
higher
duty
than
this
he
was
to
lead
her
lead
her
into
the
world
the
dreary
dark
world
so
unfitted
to
receive
such
brightness
she
had
come
to
him
clad
in
all
the
sacred
weakness
of
womanhood
and
it
was
his
proud
privilege
to
guard
and
shelter
her
from
evil
from
the
evil
in
others
but
chiefly
from
the
evil
in
himself
no
taint
must
touch
that
spotless
life
with
which
god
had
entrusted
him
sorrow
might
come
nay
must
come
since
so
long
as
humanity
errs
so
long
must
angels
grieve
sorrow
but
not
sin
a
grand
awed
sense
of
responsibility
filled
him
a
responsibility
that
he
accepted
with
passionate
gratitude
and
joy
he
had
attained
a
vaster
dignity
than
any
king
on
any
throne
and
all
the
visible
universe
was
transfigured
into
a
golden
pageant
of
loveliness
and
light
fairer
than
the
fabled
valley
of
avilion
yet
still
he
kept
her
close
beside
him
on
the
steps
of
the
mighty
dom
to
take
her
further
and
ever
and
anon
assailed
by
a
dreamy
doubt
as
to
whether
she
might
not
even
now
pass
away
from
him
suddenly
and
swiftly
as
a
mist
fading
into
heaven
when
all
at
once
the
sound
of
beating
drums
and
martial
trumpets
struck
loudly
on
the
quiet
morning
air
a
brilliant
regiment
of
mounted
uhlans
emerged
from
an
opposite
street
and
cantered
sharply
across
the
platz
and
over
the
with
streaming
pennons
burnished
helmets
and
accoutrements
glistening
in
a
long
compact
line
of
silvery
white
that
vanished
as
speedily
as
it
had
appeared
like
a
winding
flash
of
meteor
flame
alwyn
drew
a
deep
quick
breath
the
sight
of
those
armed
soldiers
roused
him
to
the
fact
that
he
was
actually
in
the
turmoil
of
present
daily
events
that
his
supernal
happiness
was
no
vision
but
reality
that
edris
his
was
with
him
in
tangible
human
guise
of
flesh
and
blood
though
how
such
a
mysterious
marvel
had
been
accomplished
he
knew
no
more
than
scientists
know
how
the
lovely
life
of
green
leaf
and
perfect
flower
can
still
be
existent
in
seeds
that
have
lain
dormant
and
dry
in
old
tombs
for
thousands
of
years
and
as
he
looked
at
her
proudly
adoringly
she
raised
her
beautiful
innocent
questioning
eyes
to
his
this
is
a
city
she
asked
a
city
of
men
who
labor
for
good
and
serve
each
other
alas
not
so
my
sweet
he
answered
his
voice
trembling
with
its
own
infinite
tenderness
there
is
no
city
on
the
sad
earth
where
men
do
not
labor
for
mere
vanity
sake
and
oppose
each
other
her
inquiring
gaze
softened
into
a
celestial
compassion
come
let
us
go
she
said
gently
we
twain
made
one
in
love
and
faith
must
hasten
to
begin
our
work
darkness
gathers
and
deepens
over
the
sorrowful
star
but
we
perchance
with
christ
most
holy
blessing
may
help
to
lift
the
shadows
into
light
away
in
a
sheltered
mountainous
retreat
apart
from
the
louder
clamor
of
the
world
the
poet
and
his
heavenly
companion
dwell
in
peace
together
their
love
their
wondrous
happiness
no
mortal
language
can
define
for
spiritual
love
perfected
as
far
exceeds
material
passion
as
the
steadfast
glory
of
the
sun
outshines
the
nickering
of
an
earthly
taper
few
very
few
there
are
who
recognize
or
who
attain
such
joy
for
men
chiefly
occupy
themselves
with
the
semblances
of
things
and
therefore
fail
to
grasp
all
high
realities
perishable
beauty
perishable
fame
these
are
mere
appearances
imperishable
worth
is
the
only
positive
and
lasting
good
and
in
the
search
for
imperishable
worth
alone
the
seeker
must
needs
encounter
angels
unawares
but
for
those
whose
pleasure
it
is
to
doubt
and
deny
all
spiritual
life
and
being
the
history
of
theos
alwyn
can
be
disposed
of
with
much
languid
ease
and
cold
logic
as
a
foolish
chimera
scarce
worth
narrating
practically
viewed
there
is
nothing
wonderful
in
it
since
it
can
all
be
traced
to
a
powerful
exertion
of
magnetic
skill
tranced
into
a
dream
bewilderment
by
the
arts
of
the
mystic
chaldean
heliobas
tricked
into
visiting
the
field
of
ardath
what
more
likely
than
that
a
real
maiden
trained
to
her
part
should
have
met
the
dreamer
there
and
with
the
secret
aid
of
the
hermit
elezar
continued
his
strange
delusion
what
more
fitting
as
a
sequel
to
the
whole
than
that
the
same
maiden
should
have
been
sent
to
him
again
in
the
great
rhine
cathedral
to
complete
the
deception
and
satisfy
his
imagination
by
linking
her
life
finally
with
his
it
is
a
perfectly
simple
explanation
of
what
some
credulous
souls
might
be
inclined
to
consider
a
mystery
and
let
the
dear
wise
oracular
people
who
can
not
admit
any
mystery
in
anything
and
who
love
to
trace
all
seeming
miracles
to
clever
imposture
accept
this
elucidation
by
all
means
they
will
be
able
to
fit
every
incident
of
the
story
into
such
an
hypothesis
with
most
admirable
and
consecutive
neatness
was
truly
a
vision
the
rest
was
what
merely
the
working
of
a
poetic
imagination
under
mesmeric
influence
so
be
it
the
poet
knows
the
truth
but
what
are
poets
only
the
prophets
and
seers
only
the
eyes
of
time
which
clearly
behold
heaven
fact
beyond
this
world
fable
let
them
sing
if
they
choose
and
we
will
hear
them
in
our
idle
hours
we
will
give
them
a
little
of
our
gold
a
little
of
our
grudging
praise
together
with
much
of
our
private
practical
contempt
and
misprisal
so
say
the
unthinking
and
foolish
so
will
they
ever
say
and
hence
it
is
that
though
the
fame
of
theos
alwyn
widens
year
by
year
and
his
sweet
clarion
harp
of
song
rings
loud
warning
promise
hope
and
consolation
above
the
noisy
tumult
of
the
whirling
age
people
listen
to
him
merely
in
vague
wonderment
and
awe
doubting
his
prophet
utterance
and
loth
to
put
away
their
sin
but
he
never
weary
in
works
on
ever
regardless
of
self
caring
nothing
for
fame
but
giving
all
the
riches
of
his
thought
for
love
clear
grand
pure
and
musical
his
writings
fill
the
time
with
hope
and
passionate
faith
and
courage
his
inspiration
fails
not
and
can
never
fail
since
edris
is
his
fount
of
ecstasy
his
name
made
glorious
by
god
blessing
shall
never
as
in
his
perished
past
be
again
forgotten
and
what
of
edris
what
of
the
wonder
of
the
field
of
ardath
strayed
for
a
while
out
of
her
native
heaven
does
the
world
know
her
marvellous
origin
perhaps
the
mystic
heliobas
knows
perhaps
even
good
frank
villiers
has
hazarded
a
reverent
guess
at
his
great
secret
but
to
the
uninstructed
what
does
she
seem
nothing
but
a
woman
most
pure
womanly
a
woman
whose
influence
on
all
is
strangely
sweet
and
lasting
whose
spirit
overflows
with
tenderest
sympathy
for
the
many
wants
and
sorrows
of
mankind
whose
voice
charms
away
care
whose
smile
engenders
peace
whose
eyes
lustrous
and
thoughtful
are
unclouded
by
any
shadow
of
sin
and
on
whose
serene
beauty
the
passing
of
years
leaves
no
visible
trace
that
she
is
fair
and
wise
joyous
radiant
and
holy
is
apparent
to
all
but
only
the
poet
her
lover
and
lord
her
subject
and
servant
can
tell
how
truly
his
edris
is
not
so
much
sweet
woman
as
most
perfect
angel
a
dream
of
heaven
made
human
let
some
of
us
hesitate
ere
we
doubt
the
miracle
for
we
are
sleepers
and
dreamers
all
and
the
hour
is
close
at
hand
when
we
shall
wake
the
end
