note

since
the
publication
of
the
first
edition
of
this
book
two
or
three
readers
have
pointed
out
that
it
needs
an
index
by
the
addition
of
an
index
they
say
its
value
as
a
work
of
reference
would
become
almost
wholly
negligible
impressed
by
the
force
of
their
remarks
i
employed
expert
aid
and
the
index
now
printed
at
the
end
of
the
volume
is
the
result
it
was
prepared
by
miss
narcissa
bloom
an
honor
graduate
of
the
philander
library
school
and
it
may
therefore
be

the

the
interest
gauge
we
are
thinking
of
calling
them
gauges
said
the
agent
but
perhaps
you
can
suggest
a
better
name
i
took
one
of
the
little
instruments
and
examined
it
hardly
over
an
inch
long
with
its
glass
tube
and
scale
it
resembled
a
tiny
thermometer
the
figures
and
letters
were
so
small
that
i
could
not
make
them
out
though
they
became
clear
enough
through
a
interest
gauges
i
remarked
sounds
like
something
connected
with
banks
i
should
think
you
could
find
a
better
name
who
invented
them
the
agent
looked
important
they
were
invented
he
explained
by
professor
dufunnie
the
great
psychologist
they
are
a
practical
application
of
psychology
let
me
show
you
how
they
are
used
allow
me
i
will
take
this
book
the
of
junius
and
attach
the
interest
gauge
here
in
the
back
you
see
the
gauge
is
invisible
to
the
reader
you
will
notice
now
if
you
look
through
the
glass
that
the
gauge
marks
zero
no
one
is
reading
the
book
we
have
not
even
opened
it
and
the
human
mind
is
not
acting
upon
the
book
if
you
will
take
it
into
your
hand
and
look
down
at
the
gauge
through
the
glass
you
will
see
probably
some
little
agitation
of
the
liquid
within
the
tube
you
do
do
you
not
i
thought
so
that
is
because
you
are
probably
already
familiar
to
some
extent
with
the
of
junius
and
the
recollections
that
they
arouse
in
your
mind
are
exerting
themselves
upon
the
fluid
now
if
you
will
oblige
me
open
the
book
and
read
attentively
for
a
few
moments
i
did
so
and
then
handed
it
back
to
the
agent
look
he
cried
as
soon
as
you
cease
reading
the
fluid
sinks
back
to
zero
but
the
little
aluminum
arrow
remains
at
the
highest
point
which
the
fluid
reached
that
is
the
highest
point
of
interest
which
you
felt
in
the
book
ah
yes
degrees
a
faint
interest
you
will
notice
that
the
are
marked
at
intervals
with
descriptive
phrases
is
interest
is
is
not
keep
you
awake
after
and
so
on
the
thing
was
very
fascinating
it
is
astounding
i
said
for
that
is
exactly
my
feeling
towards
junius
and
yet
i
tried
to
get
more
interested
in
him
than
usual
the
agent
laughed
you
ca
fool
the
gauges
he
said
you
ca
do
it
even
when
you
know
one
is
attached
to
your
book
i
need
not
say
that
it
is
absolutely
correct
when
the
reader
is
not
aware
that
there
is
a
gauge
upon
his
book
you
must
see
the
value
of
these
to
a
librarian
let
me
show
you
how
incorruptible
they
are
have
you
something
there
in
which
you
have
absolutely
no
interest
some
book
or
article
that
is
dry
as
dust
i
looked
about
this
pretty
nearly
fills
the
bill
i
said
and
i
handed
him
a
copy
of
a
library
magazine
with
an
article
by
oscar
gustafsen
on
how
to
make
the
workingman
read
the
greek
tragedies
the
agent
attached
an
interest
gauge
and
told
me
to
read
gustafsen
article
and
to
try
as
hard
as
i
could
to
become
interested
to
pretend
if
i
could
not
feel
the
greatest
excitement
over
it
i
did
so
and
strained
every
muscle
in
my
brain
so
to
speak
to
find
something
in
it
to
interest
or
attract
me
it
was
no
use
the
fluid
gave
a
few
convulsive
wabbles
but
at
the
end
the
little
arrow
had
not
even
reached
or
bored
to
death
then
the
agent
took
a
copy
of
the
doctor
dilemma
and
putting
an
interest
gauge
on
the
volume
asked
me
to
read
a
few
pages
and
to
remain
as
indifferent
as
possible
i
read
it
calmly
enough
but
the
liquid
in
the
tube
mounted
slow
and
sure
and
when
we
examined
the
arrow
it
pointed
to
try
it
on
this
said
the
agent
handing
me
conan
doyle
round
the
fire
stories
i
put
on
an
interest
gauge
and
read
the
tale
of
the
lost
special
the
arrow
shot
up
to
before
i
had
half
finished
the
yarn
the
highest
that
the
gauge
will
record
you
see
is
though
we
guarantee
them
to
stand
a
pressure
of
they
are
not
often
subjected
to
anything
like
that
the
average
novel
or
short
story
does
not
put
them
under
a
very
severe
strain
the
greatest
risk
we
run
is
from
authors
reading
their
own
books
we
had
an
especially
dangerous
case
the
other
day
during
some
tests
in
the
laboratory
we
had
a
young
author
reading
the
proofs
of
his
first
book
and
we
put
on
a
high
pressure
scale
capable
of
recording
up
to
and
even
then
we
took
off
the
gauge
only
just
in
time
it
had
reached
the
limit
and
there
were
danger
signs
what
are
danger
signs
i
asked
the
liquid
begins
to
boil
he
said
and
then
you
have
to
look
out
for
trouble
now
how
many
of
these
will
you
take
i
can
let
you
have
a
trial
dozen
for
or
two
dozen
for
two
dozen
thank
you
you
attach
them
in
the
back
of
the
book
so
fashion
or
if
the
book
is
bound
with
a
loose
back
then
you
put
them
down
here
there
is
no
danger
of
their
being
seen
in
either
case
here
is
our
card
we
shall
be
very
pleased
to
fill
any
further
orders
thank
you
good
day
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
i
left
my
office
and
went
out
into
the
public
part
of
the
library
i
had
started
for
the
when
i
heard
my
name
called
it
was
professor
frugles
the
scientific
historian
he
is
giving
his
course
of
lectures
on
the
constitutional
development
of
and
i
had
attended
one
or
two
of
them
they
had
already
been
going
on
for
two
months
and
although
he
lectured
four
times
a
week
he
had
progressed
beyond
the
introduction
and
preliminaries
both
of
the
lectures
i
had
heard
were
long
wrangles
in
which
the
professor
devoted
his
energies
to
proving
that
some
writer
on
this
subject
a
german
whose
name
i
did
not
catch
was
wholly
untrustworthy
i
was
told
by
some
of
the
most
patient
listeners
that
so
far
no
single
thing
about
itself
had
been
mentioned
and
that
it
did
not
appear
to
be
in
sight
the
course
consisted
merely
of
frugles
opinions
of
the
authorities
now
the
professor
came
slowly
toward
me
wiping
his
face
with
a
large
red
handkerchief
and
waving
his
cane
got
any
new
books
he
shouted
i
told
him
we
had
a
few
and
took
him
back
into
one
of
the
workrooms
he
examined
them
this
will
do
i
look
this
over
and
he
picked
up
something
in
german
i
offered
him
another
in
english
and
as
i
thought
rather
interesting
in
appearance
pah
he
ejaculated
as
if
i
had
put
some
nauseous
thing
under
his
nose
popular
he
exploded
this
last
word
which
was
his
most
violent
term
of
condemnation
and
ran
through
the
rest
of
the
books
well
i
take
this
into
the
and
look
it
through
and
he
started
with
the
german
book
i
prevailed
upon
him
to
take
the
other
as
well
and
he
consented
with
a
grunt
he
did
not
notice
that
i
had
slipped
an
interest
gauge
into
both
of
them
after
a
bit
i
followed
him
into
the
he
was
in
a
far
corner
hard
at
work
cornelia
crumpet
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
miss
bixby
the
reference
librarian
when
i
came
in
oh
here
mr
edwards
she
exclaimed
why
what
a
library
you
have
i
ca
find
anything
at
all
about
the
flemish
renaissance
and
i
do
not
know
what
i
shall
do
for
i
have
to
read
a
paper
on
it
afternoon
before
the
culture
club
miss
bixby
was
just
saying
she
would
get
me
something
now
what
would
you
advise
there
is
nothing
at
all
in
the
books
i
looked
at
perhaps
you
looked
in
the
wrong
books
i
suggested
observing
that
she
had
a
copy
of
thelma
under
her
arm
oh
edwards
how
ridiculous
of
you
i
carrying
this
book
home
for
the
housemaid
she
sick
in
bed
and
the
cook
said
she
was
homesick
and
threatened
to
leave
so
i
said
i
would
get
her
something
to
read
to
occupy
her
mind
this
is
fearful
trash
i
suppose
but
i
thought
it
would
keep
her
contented
until
she
got
well
but
i
do
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
to
consult
about
the
flemish
renaissance
crumpet
i
said
miss
bixby
knows
more
about
that
subject
in
one
minute
than
i
do
all
day
and
i
advise
you
to
let
her
prescribe
crumpet
agreed
to
wait
while
miss
bixby
went
for
the
books
where
that
copy
of
i
put
it
down
here
oh
you
have
it
edwards
well
you
had
better
let
me
take
it
i
sure
it
is
too
frivolous
for
you
librarians
to
read
i
sit
here
and
look
it
over
until
she
comes
back
with
those
books
she
took
it
interest
gauge
and
all
and
sat
down
miss
larkin
came
into
the
room
just
then
and
asked
me
to
come
over
to
the
children
department
i
want
to
show
you
she
said
what
an
interest
these
children
take
in
serious
reading
and
it
is
most
encouraging
when
we
arrived
at
the
children
room
she
had
two
or
three
small
persons
arranged
about
the
desks
now
willie
she
said
which
do
you
like
best
or
nature
books
willie
answered
with
great
promptness
nacher
books
the
others
all
confessed
to
an
extraordinary
fondness
for
or
biography
or
nacher
i
asked
miss
larkin
leave
to
try
a
little
experiment
and
then
explained
to
her
the
workings
of
the
interest
gauges
we
chose
willie
as
a
subject
for
our
investigations
and
gave
him
a
copy
of
one
of
his
beloved
nacher
books
with
a
gauge
attached
five
minutes
reading
by
willie
sent
the
arrow
up
to
but
the
same
time
on
the
crimson
sweater
sent
it
up
to
he
seems
to
like
barbour
better
than
the
rev
fakir
miss
larkin
i
afraid
that
his
enthusiasm
for
is
in
accordance
with
what
he
knows
will
please
you
why
do
you
use
your
influence
with
him
to
lead
him
toward
truthfulness
it
a
better
quality
even
than
a
fondness
for
as
i
went
back
i
met
professor
frugles
let
me
have
this
as
soon
as
it
is
ready
to
go
out
he
said
brandishing
the
german
work
this
other
trifling
sir
trifling
and
away
he
went
but
i
noticed
that
the
german
book
had
only
sent
the
gauge
up
to
forty
while
the
trifling
work
which
had
caused
him
to
express
so
much
contempt
had
registered
at
the
issue
desk
was
crumpet
having
her
books
charged
as
there
were
no
gauges
on
the
books
about
the
flemish
renaissance
i
had
no
data
to
go
on
except
the
fact
that
although
she
declared
she
had
skimmed
through
them
all
and
found
them
very
helpful
she
had
not
so
far
cut
any
of
the
pages
i
did
not
mention
this
to
her
as
she
might
have
retorted
that
we
ought
to
have
cut
them
ourselves
which
was
quite
true
but
while
she
talked
with
miss
carey
i
managed
to
extract
the
gauge
from
thelma
at
least
i
took
away
the
fragments
of
it
the
arrow
had
gone
up
to
and
trying
to
get
still
higher
the
little
glass
tube
had
been
smashed
to
bits
the
gardener
guide
the
gardner
guide
i
was
looking
over
the
proof
sheets
for
some
library
of
congress
catalogue
cards
when
i
observed
the
name
of
bunkum
martha
matilda
bunkum
was
the
full
name
and
i
was
further
privileged
to
learn
that
she
was
born
in
everyone
knows
bunkum
two
great
works
handy
hints
for
hillside
gardens
and
care
and
cultivation
of
crocuses
now
it
seemed
she
had
accumulated
all
her
horticultural
wisdom
into
one
book
which
was
called
the
gardener
guide
or
a
vade
mecum
of
useful
information
for
amateur
gardeners
by
martha
matilda
bunkum
the
library
of
congress
card
went
on
to
say
that
the
book
was
published
in
new
york
by
the
firm
of
ponsonby
perks
in
the
year
it
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
recalling
the
days
when
i
too
was
a
cataloguer
to
see
that
the
book
had
xiv
xv
plates
and
moreover
was
centimeters
high
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
from
my
emotion
i
pressed
the
electric
bell
three
times
a
signal
that
brings
miss
anderson
the
head
of
the
order
department
into
my
office
unless
she
happens
to
be
arranging
her
hair
before
the
mirror
in
the
at
the
moment
this
time
she
came
promptly
miss
anderson
i
said
we
must
get
a
copy
of
guide
she
instantly
looked
intelligent
and
replied
we
have
one
here
now
on
approval
it
came
in
from
malkan
this
morning
and
she
hurried
out
to
get
it
when
i
had
the
book
i
regarded
it
lovingly
i
wish
i
knew
what
the
a
book
list
says
about
this
i
pondered
it
will
be
along
in
a
couple
of
months
said
miss
anderson
and
then
we
can
find
out
i
told
miss
anderson
to
keep
the
book
anyhow
and
to
have
this
copy
charged
to
my
private
account
that
night
on
the
way
home
i
expended
for
flower
seeds
they
were
all
put
up
in
attractive
little
envelopes
with
the
most
gorgeous
pictures
on
the
front
representing
blossoms
of
tropical
splendor
on
the
backs
was
a
great
deal
of
information
as
well
as
latin
names
confident
prediction
of
what
a
dazzling
mass
of
bloom
the
little
packets
would
bring
forth
and
warnings
not
to
plant
these
seeds
deeper
than
of
an
inch
all
but
the
sunflowers
i
could
not
get
any
sunflower
seeds
in
packets
and
finally
had
to
get
them
in
a
paper
bag
an
enormous
lot
of
them
for
five
cents
but
there
were
no
pictures
and
no
directions
about
depth
all
this
i
reflected
would
be
forthcoming
from
the
pages
of
bunkum
on
the
following
evening
in
company
with
jane
i
went
forth
to
sow
jane
had
the
gardener
guide
and
i
took
certain
tools
and
implements
by
the
time
i
had
a
trench
excavated
a
little
shower
came
up
and
jane
retreated
to
the
veranda
i
had
on
old
clothes
and
mind
jane
i
called
look
up
bunkum
and
see
how
deep
to
plant
sunflower
seeds
all
the
directions
on
the
little
packets
were
so
precise
about
depths
some
seeds
an
inch
some
half
an
inch
and
some
the
poppies
for
instance
only
a
sixteenth
of
an
inch
below
the
surface
that
i
was
tremendously
impressed
with
the
importance
of
it
all
previously
i
had
thought
you
just
stuck
seeds
in
any
old
way
but
the
rain
was
coming
down
harder
now
and
my
spectacles
were
getting
blurred
jane
seemed
to
be
lost
in
admiration
of
the
frontispiece
to
the
gardener
guide
she
began
to
turn
the
leaves
of
the
index
rapidly
and
i
could
hear
her
mutter
q
r
s
here
it
is
screens
slugs
sowing
spider
on
box
oh
i
hate
spiders
sunbonnet
sweet
peas
why
there
is
anything
about
sunflowers
this
annoyed
me
very
much
jane
i
said
how
perfectly
absurd
do
you
suppose
an
authority
like
bunkum
would
write
a
book
on
gardening
and
not
mention
such
common
things
as
sunflowers
look
again
she
did
so
but
presently
shouted
back
well
i
do
care
it
goes
right
from
to
sweet
peas
and
then
sweet
william
and
then
to
the
t
tigrinum
and
tobacco
water
i
do
see
what
this
means
do
you
perhaps
it
a
misprint
for
sunflower
i
look
it
up
page
presently
jane
found
the
reference
she
was
hunting
and
read
it
to
me
leaning
out
over
the
rail
of
the
veranda
unless
a
woman
possesses
a
skin
impervious
to
wind
and
sun
she
is
apt
to
come
through
the
summer
looking
as
red
and
brown
as
an
indian
and
if
one
is
often
out
in
the
glare
about
the
only
headgear
that
can
be
worn
to
prevent
this
is
the
sunbonnet
with
its
poke
before
and
cape
behind
protecting
the
neck
one
really
can
not
become
sunburned
and
pink
ones
are
not
so
bad
retired
behind
its
friendly
shelter
you
are
somewhat
deaf
to
the
world
and
at
the
distant
house
people
may
shout
to
you
and
bells
be
rung
at
you
and
if
your
occupation
be
engrossing
the
excuse
one
can
hear
through
a
sunbonnet
must
be
accepted
jane
read
this
with
the
liveliest
interest
and
at
its
conclusion
remarked
i
believe
i
get
a
blue
one
in
spite
of
her
i
sneezed
two
or
three
times
at
this
point
and
asked
her
to
try
again
for
sunflowers
look
here
i
suggested
i
noticed
that
index
perhaps
sunflowers
are
entered
under
their
class
as
hardy
annuals
or
biennials
or
periodicals
or
whatever
they
are
look
up
that
way
she
did
so
nothing
under
annuals
she
announced
except
roses
under
it
says
also
names
of
flowers
this
made
her
laugh
and
say
here
a
librarian
getting
a
taste
of
his
own
medicine
no
it
gives
a
reference
to
page
here
it
is
are
but
few
hardy
biennials
the
important
ones
which
no
garden
should
be
without
are
digitalis
and
campanula
medium
why
i
thought
digitalis
was
something
you
put
in
your
eye
did
you
look
under
i
retorted
i
could
put
something
in
eye
did
you
look
under
jane
referred
again
to
the
index
there
is
any
such
thing
she
said
presently
do
you
mean
perennials
here
a
lot
about
them
oh
yes
and
a
list
of
them
too
now
let
me
see
aquilegia
dianthus
barbatus
dicentra
spectabilis
gracious
do
you
suppose
any
of
those
are
sunflowers
i
groaned
would
you
mind
getting
me
a
i
afraid
these
seeds
will
sprout
in
my
hand
in
a
few
minutes
if
we
do
get
some
information
soon
jane
went
into
the
house
but
returned
in
about
five
minutes
with
an
umbrella
your
is
here
she
said
you
left
it
at
the
library
that
day
that
it
cleared
during
the
afternoon
i
will
send
amanda
out
with
this
umbrella
do
so
by
all
means
i
replied
as
i
have
only
two
hands
occupied
with
the
trowel
and
the
sunflower
seeds
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
balance
an
umbrella
as
well
but
jane
did
not
notice
the
sarcasm
and
presently
amanda
tiptoed
out
through
the
wet
grass
with
the
umbrella
i
was
left
trying
to
hold
it
and
wondering
how
bunkum
acted
in
a
crisis
like
this
but
of
course
she
never
got
caught
in
one
she
would
know
right
off
the
bat
just
how
deep
to
put
the
seeds
at
any
rate
jane
researches
among
the
aquilegias
had
given
me
an
idea
look
here
i
called
bunkum
is
so
confounded
classical
or
scientific
or
whatever
it
is
that
i
believe
she
scorns
to
use
such
a
vulgar
word
as
sunflower
she
probably
put
it
under
its
scientific
name
jane
looked
as
though
the
last
difficulty
had
been
removed
what
would
the
scientific
name
be
she
inquired
i
am
trying
to
think
as
well
as
i
can
standing
in
this
puddle
i
was
sparring
for
time
it
would
be
something
i
suppose
i
added
heliotrope
of
course
exclaimed
jane
with
a
glad
chortle
here
they
are
all
about
them
no
no
no
i
shouted
i
do
wish
you
would
jump
at
conclusions
so
heliotrope
means
a
flower
that
turns
around
to
follow
the
sun
well
she
said
i
thought
sunflowers
did
that
so
they
do
i
told
her
but
heliotropes
are
little
blue
things
as
you
very
well
know
or
ought
to
now
you
go
to
the
telephone
and
call
up
the
library
and
ask
for
miss
fairfax
she
is
in
the
reference
room
now
or
ought
to
be
there
was
a
pause
while
i
could
hear
jane
at
the
telephone
north

six

foolish
exhibition

i
know
these
librarians
if
they

stingy

giving
them

well

package

david
what
bailey
who
i
know

some
of
them

oh
well
wait
a
minute
hold
the
line
sam
and
she
came
out
to
the
veranda
again
sam
what
bailey
is
it
they
are
to
look
it
up
in
liberty
hyde
i
yelled
cyclopædia
of
american
horticulture
but
any
dictionary

probably
do
and
for
the
love
of
mike
get
a
move
on
i
drowned
paralyzed
i
have
rheumatism
for
a
week
but
she
was
already
back
at
the
telephone
david
are
you
there
edwards
says
it
liberty
hyde
cyclopædia
of
horticulture
and
you
are
to
hurry
hurry
what
is
that
you
do
know
where
it
is
well
look
it
up
in
the
catalogue
oh
ask
miss
anderson
to
come
back
is
that
you
miss
anderson
will
you
look
it
up
please
yes
the
scientific
name
for
sunflowers
in
freedom
bailey
cyclopædia
of
agriculture
or
any
dictionary
did
you
find
it
yes
what
spell
it
oh
thank
you
so
much
and
do
forget
to
send
chaperone
home
by
edwards
night
thank
you
for
keeping
me
a
copy
she
came
back
to
the
veranda
i
got
it
at
last
sam
it
where
bunkum
oh
i
left
her
in
the
study
just
wait
a
minute
now
yes
here
it
is
helianthus
sure
enough
how
silly
why
does
she
call
sunflowers
there
page
this
is
what
bunkum
says
helianthus
grandiflora
or
common
sunflower
is
one
of
the
most
attractive
and
satisfactory
of
the
perennials
nothing
is
so
suitable
to
place
against
a
wall
or
to
employ
to
cover
a
shed
or
any
other
unattractive
feature
of
the
landscape
the
stalks
grow
sometimes
as
high
as
eight
to
ten
feet
and
bloom
from
july
to
september
it
is
well
not
to
plant
delphiniums
too
near
the
helianthus
as
the
shade
from
the
former
is
too
intense
and
it
would
not
do
to
risk
spoiling
the
lovely
blossoms
of
the
delphinium
the
latter
why
broke
out
jane
she
goes
on
about
delphiniums
now
and
does
tell
any
more
about
sunflowers
do
you
mean
to
say
i
asked
and
there
was
a
hard
steely
ring
in
my
voice
do
you
mean
to
say
that
bunkum
does
not
tell
how
deep
i
am
to
plant
these
cussed
seeds
jane
was
about
to
laugh
or
to
cry
i
am
not
sure
which
not
a
word
more
than
what
i
read
she
answered
jane
i
said
solemnly
and
firmly
go
into
the
house
what
is
going
to
happen
is
not
a
fit
sight
for
your
eyes
praise
be
that
book
is
mine
and
not
the
library
and
i
can
deal
with
it
justly
give
it
here
and
if
you
have
any
affection
for
martha
matilda
bunkum
kiss
her
i
do
not
know
how
deep
these
seeds
go
but
i
know
how
deep
she
goes
and
i
began
to
dig
a
suitable
hole
i
rejoined
my
wife
at
dinner
after
a
bath
and
certain
remedies
milton
uttered
curses
on
him
who
destroyed
a
good
book
but
what
do
you
think
will
come
up
in
ground
fertilized
by
mrs
bunkum
i
asked
jane
giggled
i
do
not
know
she
said
but
if
you
erect
a
tombstone
to
her
i
can
suggest
an
epitaph
what
is
it
i
questioned
the
gardeners
guyed
said
jane
vanishing
favorites
vanishing
favorites
it
is
nearly
twelve
months
since
anyone
has
lamented
the
disappearance
of
our
old
favorite
characters
of
fiction
while
these
expressions
of
sorrow
are
undoubtedly
sincere
they
are
seldom
practical
no
one
for
instance
has
ever
suggested
any
method
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
heroes
and
villains
of
the
old
plays
and
romances
no
one
has
urged
that
when
the
government
subsidizes
authors
and
pensions
poets
a
sum
shall
be
set
aside
for
such
writers
as
will
agree
to
stick
to
the
characters
yet
it
would
prove
effective
of
its
desirability
nothing
need
be
said
it
is
no
answer
to
those
who
regret
the
passing
of
their
old
friends
to
say
that
they
can
still
be
found
in
the
old
books
that
is
like
sending
to
a
museum
to
view
dried
bones
some
person
who
yearns
to
behold
the
ichthyosaurus
splashing
among
the
waves
or
the
pterodactyl
soaring
overhead
indeed
the
cases
are
similar
for
more
than
one
reason
how
greatly
would
the
joy
of
life
increase
if
we
only
had
a
few
extinct
animals
left
the
african
hunter
returns
with
an
assortment
of
hippopotamuses
elephants
and
jubjub
birds
it
would
be
more
delightful
if
he
could
also
fetch
the
mighty
glyptodon
the
terrible
dinotherium
and
the
stately
bandersnatch
there
are
few
of
the
old
characters
of
fiction
more
generally
missed
than
the
retired
colonel
home
from
india
he
was
usually
rather
portly
in
figure
though
sometimes
tall
and
thin
always
his
face
was
the
color
of
a
boiled
lobster
and
his
white
moustache
and
eyebrows
bristled
furiously
for
forty
years
he
had
lived
exclusively
on
curries
chutney
and
brandy
and
soda
so
his
liver
was
not
all
it
should
be
his
temper
had
not
sweetened
he
was
what
you
might
call
irritable
during
forty
years
he
had
been
lord
and
master
over
a
regiment
of
soldiers
and
a
village
of
natives
and
he
had
the
habit
of
command
his
favorite
remark
was
that
is
as
near
as
it
can
be
reproduced
in
print
but
from
the
manner
in
which
his
lips
rolled
when
he
delivered
it
and
the
explosive
force
with
which
it
ended
you
could
see
that
he
had
learned
it
from
a
bengal
tiger
his
was
an
imposing
presence
but
his
speaking
part
was
not
large
in
fact
his
only
contributions
to
social
intercourse
were
the
exclamation
which
has
been
quoted
and
one
other
this
sounded
like
yah
but
it
was
delivered
with
a
rasping
snarl
which
must
be
heard
to
be
appreciated
such
was
his
manner
toward
his
equals
toward
servants
and
underlings
he
was
not
so
agreeable
on
the
whole
there
was
reason
to
think
that
he
was
somehow
related
to
the
celebrated
personage
who
eats
alive
or
to
that
other
individual
called
gritchfang
who
guzzled
hot
blood
and
blew
up
with
a
bang
the
colonel
was
a
genial
and
interesting
old
party
and
we
lament
his
disappearance
there
was
a
to
coo
however
in
the
same
stories
where
the
colonel
roared
this
was
the
dying
maiden
she
has
not
altogether
left
us
her
final
struggles
are
protracted
her
dissolution
is
expected
at
almost
any
moment
now
her
specialty
was
being
wan
come
what
might
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
under
all
circumstances
she
was
very
very
wan
you
could
never
catch
her
forgetting
it
she
reminded
you
of
bunthorne
injunction
to
the
twenty
lovesick
maidens
she
made
you
think
of
faint
lilies
usually
she
lay
on
a
couch
in
the
but
she
could
with
assistance
make
her
way
to
the
window
to
wave
her
handkerchief
to
cousin
harry
departing
to
the
war
she
was
in
love
with
cousin
harry
but
knew
that
he
cared
most
for
proud
sister
gladys
so
she
suffered
in
silence
and
when
cousin
harry
forged
a
few
checks
she
bought
them
up
and
arranged
a
happy
marriage
between
harry
and
gladys
who
was
in
love
with
someone
else
this
was
so
that
she
could
be
a
martyr
she
loved
being
a
martyr
and
was
willing
to
make
everyone
else
intensely
uncomfortable
in
order
to
accomplish
her
object
she
was
very
gentle
and
sweet
and
even
the
colonel
would
cease
to
bellow
and
snort
in
her
presence
the
really
learned
heroine
has
gone
for
good
she
is
as
rare
as
the
megatherium
her
successors
the
women
who
can
discuss
a
little
politics
or
who
know
something
about
literature
are
only
collateral
descendants
there
is
some
doubt
about
even
that
degree
of
kinship
they
are
not
the
real
things
our
old
friend
had
stockings
of
cerulean
blue
though
she
would
have
died
had
she
shown
half
an
inch
of
one
of
them
her
idea
of
courtship
was
to
get
the
hero
in
a
woodland
bower
and
then
say
something
like
this
perhaps
you
have
never
realized
montmorency
how
profoundly
the
philosophy
of
the
rosicrucians
has
affected
modern
thought
in
its
ultimate
conception
of
ontology
the
epistemological
sciences
exhibit
the
effect
of
thales
dictum
concerning
the
fourth
state
of
material
cosmogony
and
montmorency
liked
it
too
he
had
a
reply
all
ready
he
wondered
if
it
really
was
thales
so
much
as
empedocles
or
ctesias
she
showed
him
that
his
suspicions
were
groundless
thales
was
the
man
he
gave
up
all
idea
of
holding
her
hand
and
listened
to
a
discourse
on
the
peripatetics
after
this
kind
of
heroine
is
it
any
wonder
that
we
object
to
the
ladies
with
a
passion
for
alcohol
who
are
served
to
us
by
the
novelist
of
the
learned
heroine
of
the
old
books
talked
as
no
one
can
talk
now
except
possibly
a
radcliffe
girl
with
a
blue
book
in
front
of
her
the
clock
pointing
to
a
quarter
of
twelve
and
a
realization
that
a
failure
to
get
b
minus
in
the
exam
will
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
secure
a
degree
in
three
years
the
saintly
children
of
the
old
fiction
are
perhaps
the
offspring
of
the
learned
heroine
and
montmorency
certainly
such
a
marriage
would
result
in
children
of
no
commonplace
type
these
however
tend
not
so
much
to
scholarship
as
to
good
behavior
they
would
get
in
all
their
studies
but
plus
in
deportment
they
are
too
good
to
be
true
they
have
enough
piety
to
fit
out
a
convocation
of
bishops
with
a
great
deal
left
over
the
little
girls
among
them
are
addicted
to
the
habit
only
they
carry
the
matter
further
than
the
invalid
heroine
they
actually
die
the
one
thing
worth
living
for
in
their
estimation
is
to
gather
a
group
of
weeping
relatives
and
the
minister
about
their
beds
on
a
beautiful
morning
in
june
and
then
pass
serenely
away
uttering
sentiments
of
such
lofty
morality
that
even
the
minister
feels
abashed
the
pet
lamb
the
hoop
the
golden
curls
and
the
pantalettes
which
had
been
their
accessories
during
seven
years
in
the
mortal
vale
are
cheerfully
left
behind
for
the
joy
of
this
solemn
moment
there
ought
to
be
no
dispute
over
the
statement
that
one
other
fictitious
character
is
badly
missed
this
is
the
family
ghost
the
modern
substitute
for
the
real
thing
is
like
offering
a
seat
in
a
trolley
car
to
someone
who
has
been
used
to
a
sedan
chair
the
modern
ghost
is
a
product
of
a
psychological
laboratory
and
you
know
that
his
bertillon
measurements
are
filed
away
in
a
somewhere
the
old
ghost
used
to
groan
and
clank
chains
and
leave
gouts
of
blood
gouts
always
never
drops
all
over
the
place
or
if
it
were
a
lady
ghost
she
sighed
sweetly
and
slipped
out
of
your
bedroom
window
to
the
moonlit
balcony
you
could
get
along
with
ghosts
like
either
of
them
you
knew
what
they
were
up
to
but
the
ghost
of
contemporary
fiction
is
as
obscure
as
henry
james
he
is
a
kind
of
disembodied
idea
he
never
groans
nor
clanks
chains
and
you
can
not
be
sure
whether
he
is
a
ghost
or
a
psychological
suggestion
or
a
slight
attack
of
malarial
fever
in
nothing
is
the
degeneracy
and
effeminacy
of
our
literature
more
apparent
than
in
its
anæmic
ghosts
hashimura
togo
says
that
when
a
negro
janitor
sees
a
ghost
he
are
a
superstition
but
when
a
college
professor
sees
one
he
are
a
scientific
phenomenon
when
that
point
has
been
reached
with
real
ghosts
what
can
be
expected
of
the
fictitious
ones
along
with
the
family
ghost
disappeared
the
faithful
old
family
servant
he
was
usually
a
man
and
he
looked
like
willard
as
cyrus
blenkarn
he
dressed
in
clothes
and
he
bent
over
swaying
from
side
to
side
like
a
in
a
cage
he
rubbed
his
hands
but
he
was
very
devoted
to
the
young
mistress
lor
bless
yer
sir
he
knew
her
mother
he
did
when
she
was
only
that
high
carried
her
in
his
arms
when
she
was
a
little
babby
but
he
is
afraid
something
is
going
wrong
with
the
old
place
he
does
like
the
looks
of
things
nohow
with
the
superhuman
instinct
granted
to
servants
but
denied
to
their
superiors
he
has
become
suspicious
of
the
villain
on
sight
it
is
lucky
that
no
one
believes
the
old
servant
or
they
would
pitch
out
the
villain
then
and
there
and
the
story
would
come
to
an
end
at
chapter
ii
the
utter
chaos
into
which
villains
have
fallen
has
been
a
cause
for
regretful
comment
for
years
past
long
ago
it
was
pointed
out
that
villains
no
longer
employ
direct
and
honorable
methods
like
murder
and
assault
the
sum
of
their
criminal
activities
is
a
operation
that
ruins
the
hero
things
have
gone
from
bad
to
worse
now
you
can
not
tell
which
is
the
villain
and
which
the
hero
the
old
simple
days
when
the
villain
as
jerome
said
was
immediately
recognized
by
the
fact
that
he
smoked
a
cigarette
have
long
since
passed
away
now
the
villain
and
hero
in
chapter
have
usually
changed
places
two
or
three
times
by
the
end
of
the
book
let
no
one
think
that
this
complaint
is
made
because
we
regret
losing
our
admiration
for
the
hero
we
never
had
any
he
was
always
such
a
ninny
that
you
longed
to
throw
rocks
at
him
from
the
start
the
lamentable
thing
is
to
see
the
villain
falling
steadily
away
from
the
paths
of
vice
and
crime
and
taking
up
with
one
virtuous
practice
after
another
meanwhile
the
hero
is
making
feeble
efforts
at
villainy
which
result
of
course
in
complete
failure
you
can
not
learn
to
be
a
villain
at
chapter
xxiv
it
is
too
late
villains
like
poets
are
born
not
made
and
in
the
older
books
the
faithful
servant
could
tell
you
that
the
villain
was
bad
from
the
cradle
hereditary
influence
and
unremitting
attention
to
business
are
as
necessary
in
the
villain
trade
as
in
any
other
there
is
one
other
phase
of
the
making
of
villains
which
deserves
consideration
that
is
their
nationality
once
you
had
only
to
know
that
the
man
who
appeared
at
chapter
twirling
his
moustache
and
making
polite
speeches
was
a
french
count
or
a
russian
prince
to
be
sure
that
on
him
would
fall
the
responsible
post
of
chief
villain
during
the
rest
of
the
story
if
the
novel
were
written
in
america
an
english
lord
could
be
added
to
the
list
the
titled
foreigner
whatever
he
might
be
was
expected
to
try
to
elope
with
the
heroine
for
the
sake
of
her
money
the
hero
baffled
him
finally
and
seized
the
opportunity
at
the
moment
of
bafflement
to
deliver
a
few
patriotic
sentences
on
the
general
superiority
of
republican
institutions
this
is
all
changed
we
have
had
novels
and
plays
with
virtuous
even
admirable
english
lords
once
or
twice
members
of
the
french
nobility
have
appeared
in
another
capacity
than
that
of
advance
agent
of
wickedness
it
is
time
to
call
a
halt
or
the
first
thing
we
know
someone
will
write
a
book
with
a
virtuous
russian
prince
in
it
the
line
must
be
drawn
somewhere
the
mission
of
russia
in
english
literature
is
to
furnish
tall
smooth
diabolical
persons
devoted
to
vodka
absinthe
oppression
of
the
peasantry
cultivation
of
a
black
beard
and
general
cussedness
we
foresee
that
the
novelists
will
soon
have
to
draw
upon
japan
for
their
villains
much
ought
to
be
made
of
a
small
oily
smiling
oriental
who
is
nursing
horrid
plots
beneath
a
courteous
exterior
at
the
time
of
the
first
performances
of
moody
play
the
great
divide
it
was
pleasant
to
see
that
a
sense
of
fitness
in
the
nationality
of
villains
had
not
entirely
died
out
it
may
be
remembered
that
the
first
act
represents
an
american
man
joining
with
a
mexican
and
a
nondescript
in
an
atrocious
criminal
enterprise
at
least
one
newspaper
had
the
sturdy
patriotism
to
call
the
dramatist
to
account
for
insinuating
that
an
american
could
possibly
do
such
a
thing
furriners
perhaps
but
americans
never
shame
on
you
moody
while
so
many
of
the
chief
characters
of
the
old
fiction
have
vanished
there
is
a
chorus
of
minor
ones
who
have
also
moved
away
where
for
instance
is
the
village
simpleton
he
was
a
useful
personage
for
he
could
be
depended
upon
to
make
the
necessary
heroic
sacrifice
in
the
last
chapter
but
one
when
the
church
steeple
burst
into
flames
or
the
dam
broke
and
the
flood
descended
on
the
town
or
the
secondary
villain
was
tying
the
heroine
mother
to
the
railroad
track
the
hero
was
holding
the
center
of
the
stage
and
seeing
that
the
heroine
escaped
in
safety
but
who
was
that
slight
figure
climbing
aloft
in
the
lurid
glare
of
the
burning
belfry
or
swimming
across
the
raging
torrent
or
running
up
to
the
bridge
waving
a
red
lantern
who
indeed
but
poor
despised
benny
bilkins
the
village
idiot
he
fell
with
a
crash
when
the
steeple
came
down
or
disappeared
forever
in
the
angry
swirling
waters
or
was
ground
under
the
wheels
of
the
locomotive
but
then
there
was
a
grave
for
the
heroine
to
strew
violets
upon
in
the
last
chapter
the
miser
too
has
utterly
disappeared
in
facial
characteristics
he
resembled
the
faithful
old
family
servant
except
that
he
had
deeper
lines
on
his
brow
he
liked
to
get
out
a
table
and
sit
over
it
with
a
bag
of
gold
no
banks
for
him
he
wanted
his
gold
pieces
near
at
hand
so
that
he
could
fetch
them
out
at
any
hour
clink
them
together
and
gloat
over
them
he
was
a
clinker
and
a
gloater
he
cared
for
nothing
else
we
do
not
have
any
misers
now
or
if
they
exist
they
go
away
to
a
safety
deposit
vault
get
their
bonds
and
gloat
over
them
half
the
fun
is
gone
you
see
you
can
gloat
over
bonds
as
much
as
you
like
but
not
a
clink
can
you
get
out
of
them
that
probably
accounts
for
the
disappearance
of
misers
we
earnestly
request
some
novelist
to
bring
about
a
resurrection
of
these
characters
they
would
be
welcome
in
the
short
stories
as
well
during
the
past
fifteen
years
american
fiction
has
gone
through
two
epochs
the
gadzooks
school
and
the
school
it
is
now
congealed
in
what
may
be
called
the
ten
below
zero
school
any
constant
reader
of
the
magazines
has
to
keep
on
his
ulster
mittens
and
from
one
year
end
to
another
it
never
thaws
loggers
miners
trappers
explorers
any
kind
of
persons
so
long
as
they
dwell
in
the
frozen
north
are
what
the
magazine
writer
adores
one
of
kipling
characters
says
that
there
never
a
law
of
god
or
man
runs
north
of
the
magazine
editors
seem
to
think
there
never
a
thing
worth
writing
of
lives
south
of
will
not
some
of
them
dig
up
one
or
two
of
the
old
characters
we
have
been
discussing
and
see
if
they
can
not
send
the
thermometer
up
a
few
degrees
we
are
tired
of
stamping
our
feet
blowing
on
our
hands
and
rubbing
snow
on
our
noses
to
keep
them
from
falling
off
by
telephone
by
telephone
on
january
so
announced
a
circular
issued
last
month
by
the
ezra
beesly
free
public
library
of
baxter
we
shall
install
a
telephone
service
at
the
library
telephone
your
inquiries
to
the
library
and
they
will
be
answered
over
the
wire
now
january
was
last
saturday
and
this
is
undoubtedly
the
first
account
of
the
innovation
at
baxter
miss
pansy
patterson
assistant
reference
librarian
took
her
seat
at
the
telephone
promptly
at
nine
ready
to
answer
all
questions
she
had
near
her
a
small
revolving
bookcase
containing
an
encyclopædia
a
dictionary
the
statesman
year
book
who
who
in
america
mulhall
dictionary
of
statistics
the
old
almanack
the
catalogue
of
the
boston
athenæum
baedeker
guide
book
to
the
united
states
cruden
concordance
and
a
few
others
of
the
most
valuable
reference
books
in
daily
use
among
librarians
should
this
stock
fail
her
she
could
send
the
stenographer
miss
parkinson
on
a
hurry
call
to
the
where
miss
bixby
the
head
reference
librarian
would
be
able
to
draw
on
a
larger
collection
of
books
to
find
the
necessary
information
amos
vanhoff
the
new
librarian
of
baxter
stood
over
the
telephone
rubbing
his
hands
in
pleasant
anticipation
of
the
workings
of
the
new
system
which
he
had
installed
the
bell
rang
almost
immediately
and
miss
patterson
took
the
receiver
from
its
hook
is
this
the
library
yes
this
is
humphrey
mayo
i
understand
that
you
answer
inquiries
by
telephone
yes
thank
you
have
you
any
books
about
birds
oh
yes
a
great
many
which
well
i
am
so
much
interested
in
a
large
bird
that
has
been
perching
on
a
syringa
bush
on
our
front
lawn
for
the
last
half
hour
it
is
a
very
bird
i
have
never
seen
one
like
it
i
can
not
make
it
out
clearly
through
the
opera
glass
and
i
do
not
dare
to
go
nearer
than
the
piazza
for
fear
of
startling
it
i
only
discovered
it
as
i
was
eating
breakfast
and
i
do
not
know
how
long
it
has
been
there
none
of
the
bird
books
i
own
seem
to
tell
anything
about
such
a
bird
now
if
i
should
describe
it
to
you
do
you
think
you
could
look
it
up
in
some
of
your
books
why
i
think
so
well
it
a
very
large
bird
like
an
eagle
or
a
large
hawk
and
it
is
nearly
all
black
but
its
feathers
are
very
much
ruffled
up
it
has
a
collar
or
ruff
around
its
neck
and
on
its
head
there
is
a
splash
of
bright
crimson
or
scarlet
i
think
it
must
be
some
tropical
bird
that
has
lost
its
way
perhaps
it
is
hurt
now
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
you
see
i
have
any
bird
books
right
at
hand
i
send
in
to
the
will
you
hold
the
line
please
miss
patterson
turned
to
the
stenographer
and
repeated
description
of
the
strange
bird
will
you
please
ask
miss
bixby
to
look
it
up
and
let
me
know
as
soon
as
possible
during
the
interval
that
followed
the
operator
at
central
asked
three
times
did
you
get
them
and
three
times
mayo
and
miss
patterson
chanted
in
unison
yes
hold
the
line
please
finally
the
messenger
returned
remarking
timidly
he
says
it
a
crow
a
crow
exclaimed
miss
patterson
a
crow
echoed
mayo
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
oh
that
is
impossible
i
know
when
i
see
them
why
this
has
a
ruff
and
a
magnificent
red
coloring
about
its
head
oh
it
no
crow
whom
did
you
see
in
there
inquired
miss
patterson
miss
bixby
no
replied
the
young
and
timid
stenographer
it
was
that
young
man
i
do
know
his
name
she
had
entered
the
library
service
only
the
week
before
oh
edgar
he
does
know
anything
about
anything
miss
bixby
must
have
left
the
room
for
a
moment
and
i
suppose
he
had
brought
in
a
book
for
a
reader
he
is
only
a
page
you
must
ask
him
any
questions
do
go
back
and
see
if
miss
bixby
is
there
now
and
ask
her
a
long
wait
ensued
and
as
mayo
neighbor
insisted
on
using
the
telephone
to
order
her
dinner
from
the
marketmen
the
line
had
to
be
abandoned
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
however
the
assistant
reference
librarian
was
once
more
in
communication
with
mayo
we
think
the
bird
might
possibly
be
a
california
grebe
but
we
can
not
say
for
sure
it
is
either
that
or
else
hawkins
giant
kingfisher
unless
it
has
a
tuft
back
of
each
ear
if
it
has
the
tufts
it
may
be
the
hoopoo
but
reginald
kookle
is
in
the
library
and
we
have
asked
him
about
it
you
know
of
kookle
of
course

author
of
warblers
of
waltham
and
or
garden
birds
yes
and
of
i
have
seen
between
temple
place
and
boylston
street
and
chickadee
and
his
children
yes
indeed
i
know
his
books
very
well
i
own
several
of
them
what
does
he
think
he
is
not
sure
but
miss
bixby
described
this
bird
to
him
and
he
is
very
much
interested
he
has
started
for
your
house
already
because
he
wants
to
see
the
bird
oh
that
will
be
perfectly
lovely
thank
you
so
much
it
will
be
fine
to
have
kookle
opinion
and
the
conference
was
ended
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
relate
that
kookle
the
eminent
bird
author
arrived
at
mayo
a
few
minutes
later
as
he
heard
that
the
mysterious
stranger
was
on
the
front
lawn
he
approached
the
house
carefully
from
the
rear
and
climbed
over
the
back
fence
he
walked
around
the
piazza
to
the
front
door
where
mayo
awaited
him
kookle
was
dressed
in
his
famous
brown
suit
worn
in
order
that
he
might
be
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
color
of
dead
grass
and
hence
as
nearly
as
possible
unseen
on
the
snowless
winter
landscape
he
had
his
field
glasses
already
leveled
on
the
syringa
bush
when
mayo
greeted
him
she
carried
an
opera
glass
right
there
do
you
see
mr
kookle
yes
i
see
him
all
right
they
both
looked
intently
at
the
bird
the
weather
was
a
little
unfavorable
for
close
observation
for
as
it
may
be
remembered
saturday
morning
was
by
turns
foggy
and
rainy
a
light
mist
hung
over
the
wet
grass
now
but
the
tropical
visitor
or
whatever
he
was
could
be
descried
without
much
difficulty
he
sat
or
stood
either
on
the
lower
branches
of
the
bush
or
amongst
them
on
the
ground
his
feathers
were
decidedly
ruffled
and
he
turned
his
back
toward
his
observers
his
shoulders
were
a
little
drawn
up
in
the
attitude
usually
ascribed
by
artists
to
napoleon
looking
out
over
the
ocean
from
helena
rocky
isle
but
it
was
possible
even
at
that
distance
to
see
his
magnificent
crimson
crest
kookle
took
a
deep
breath
yes
he
said
i
suspected
it
what
inquired
mayo
eagerly
what
is
it
madam
returned
the
bird
author
impressively
you
have
my
sincerest
congratulations
i
envy
you
you
have
the
distinction
of
having
been
the
first
observer
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
of
the
only
specimen
of
the
bulbus
claristicus
giganticus
ever
known
to
come
north
of
the
fourteenth
parallel
of
latitude
mayo
was
moved
nearly
to
tears
never
in
all
her
career
as
a
bird
enthusiast
not
even
when
she
addressed
the
twenty
minute
culture
club
on
sparrows
i
have
known
never
had
she
felt
the
solemn
joy
that
filled
her
at
this
minute
are
you
sure
that
is
what
it
is
she
asked
in
hushed
tones
absolutely
positive
replied
the
authority
at
least
if
i
could
only
get
a
nearer
view
of
his
feet
i
could
speak
with
certainty
now
if
we
could
surround
the
bush
so
to
speak
you
creeping
up
from
one
side
and
i
from
the
other
we
might
get
nearer
to
him
i
will
make
a
détour
to
your
driveway
and
so
get
on
the
other
side
of
him
you
approach
him
from
the
house
just
let
me
get
my
rubbers
said
mayo
please
hurry
the
other
returned
when
the
rubbers
were
procured
they
commenced
their
strategic
movement
if
i
could
only
be
sure
that
it
is
the
bulbus
ejaculated
kookle
mayo
turned
toward
him
do
you
suppose
she
whispered
that
it
is
the
great
condor
of
the
andes
kookle
shook
his
head
then
they
both
started
again
on
their
stealthy
errand
slowly
quietly
they
proceeded
until
they
stood
opposite
each
other
with
the
syringa
and
its
strange
visitant
between
them
then
kookle
raised
his
hand
as
a
signal
and
they
began
to
approach
the
bush
the
bird
seemed
to
hear
them
for
he
immediately
took
interest
in
the
proceedings
he
raised
his
head
hopped
out
from
the
bush
and
uttered
a
peculiar
hoarse
note
that
sounded
like
kookle
and
mayo
stopped
in
their
tracks
electrified
then
the
bird
put
its
other
foot
on
the
ground
and
gave
vent
to
this
remarkable
song
cut
cut
cut
cut
cut
then
it
gave
two
or
three
more
raucous
squawks
ran
toward
the
fence
flew
over
it
ran
across
the
street
under
higgins
fence
and
joined
his
other
black
minorca
fowls
that
were
seeking
their
breakfast
in
the
side
yard
then
mayo
returned
to
the
house
and
reginald
kookle
the
author
of
winged
warblers
of
waltham
and
the
chickadee
and
his
children
returned
his
field
glasses
to
their
case
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
famous
brown
suit
and
walked
rapidly
down
the
street
but
miss
patterson
had
been
busy
at
the
library
telephone
all
this
time
scarcely
had
she
ended
her
conversation
with
mayo
when
someone
called
her
to
have
her
repeat
curfew
shall
not
ring
over
the
telephone
this
was
only
finished
when
the
bell
rang
again
hello
this
the
library
yes
well
i
wish
you
tell
me
the
answer
to
this
there
a
prize
offered
in
the
howl
for
the
first
correct
answer
am
only
half
as
old
as
my
uncle
said
a
man
if
i
were
twice
as
old
as
he
is
i
should
only
be
three
years
older
than
my
grandfather
who
was
born
at
the
age
of
sixteen
how
old
was
the
man
now
would
you
let
x
equal
the
age
of
the
uncle
or
the
man
miss
patterson
could
not
think
of
any
immediate
answer
to
this
nor
of
any
book
of
reference
that
would
tell
her
instantly
so
she
appealed
to
vanhoff
who
had
returned
to
the
room
what
was
that
inquired
vanhoff
get
him
to
repeat
it
she
did
so
and
the
librarian
struggled
with
it
for
a
moment
why
it
is
all
nonsense
tell
him
that
we
can
not
solve
any
newspaper
puzzles
over
the
telephone
he
will
have
to
come
to
the
library
then
pomfret
smith
announced
herself
on
the
telephone
that

miss
patterson

vanhoff
i
was

down
to
the
library
this
telephone
booth
is
so
hot
i
ca

my
breath
pomfret
smith
unlike
jeffries
had
come
back
she
greeted
miss
patterson
with
enthusiasm
oh
miss
patterson
i
remembered
all
about
it
now
you
see
it
starts
this
way
there
is
a
girl
a
new
york
girl
who
has
married
an
english
lord
or
rather
she
is
just
going
to
marry
him
the
brother
of
the
first
man
she
was
engaged
to
steps
in
and
tells
her
that
the
lord
is
genuine
and
he
presents
her
maid
with
a
jeweled
pin
which
his
mother
the
countess
received
from
her
husband
her
first
husband
that
is
three
days
after
the
battle
of
oh
i
do
know
the
name
of
the
battle
the
of
the
light
brigade
it
was
and
he
was
in
that
no
his
uncle
was
and
he
said
to
his
the
night
before
the
battle
i
not
coming
out
of
this
alive
and
my
cousin
will
be
the
lawful
heir
but
i
want
you
to
take
this
and
dig
with
it
underneath
the
floor
of
the
old
summer
house
and
the
papers
that
you
will
find
there
will
make
gerald
a
rich
man
and
so
he
took
it
and
when
he
got
to
washington
he
handed
it
to
the
old
family
servant
who
had
seen
him
for
sixty
years
and
then
dropped
dead
so
they
never
knew
whether
he
was
the
real
one
or
only
the
impostor
and
so
just
as
the
wedding
was
about
to
take
place
the
uncle
he
was
a
senator
said
to
the
bishop
who
was
going
to
marry
them
get
off
this
line
i
am
using
it
and
so
it
never
took
place
after
all
now
can
you
tell
me
what
the
name
of
the
book
is
miss
patterson
why
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
recognize
it
it
sounds
a
little
like
humphry
ward
and
ouida
and
frances
hodgson
burnett
and
someone
else
all
at
once
was
it
by
any
of
them
mrs
smith
oh
no
i
am
sure
it
was
not
why
i
am
surprised
i
thought
you
would
know
it
now
without
any
hesitation
i
am
sorry
oh
very
well
then
the
last
in
a
tone
as
acid
and
cold
as
lemon
ice
it
seemed
to
express
smith
opinion
of
all
librarians
miss
patterson
was
much
grieved
but
the
telephone
bell
rang
again
before
she
had
time
to
reflect
is
this
the
library
oh
yes
i
wonder
if
you
have
a
life
of
mrs
browning

can
not
enter
into
a
detailed
description
of
the
game
but
we
must
say
that
a
more
hopelessly
affair
we
have
never
witnessed
the
team
captained
by
the
prince
of
denmark
had
about
as
much
chance
against
that
led
by
the
son
of
peleus
as
miss
select
school
for
girls
would
against
the
yale
both
teams
were
badly
off
for
tackles
and
while
we
do
not
wish
to
criticise
the
fairly
good
game
played
by
sir
launcelot
and
captain
brassbound
we
can
not
help
remarking
that
neither
mercutio
nor
raffles
had
any
business
in
that
position
we
understand
that
raffles
formerly
had
some
reputation
as
a
cricketer
and
we
advise
him
to
stick
to
that
game
as
for
mercutio
whose
reputation
we
believe
rests
chiefly
on
a
rather
unsuccessful
duel
in
verona
a
number
of
years
ago
it
was
plain
that
his
was
the
weakest
part
of
the
line
time
and
again
hector
tore
through
mercutio
for
big
gains
indeed
if
hamlet
had
had
the
sense
to
keep
pounding
at
left
tackle
his
team
might
at
least
have
scored
one
touchdown
but
instead
captain
hamlet
would
wander
off
between
the
plays
muttering
to
himself
something
about
to
punt
or
not
to
punt
and
the
quarter
ortheris
was
left
to
run
the
team
alone
this
was
unfortunate
for
although
ortheris
played
a
quick
and
snappy
game
himself
his
signals
were
badly
chosen
we
believe
that
the
climate
of
india
where
he
used
to
reside
affected
him
in
some
unfavorable
manner
so
that
he
is
subject
to
occasional
fits
of
madness
what
with
the
peculiarity
of
the
captain
of
his
team
in
this
respect
it
seemed
as
if
their
side
were
badly
handicapped
umslopogaas
played
brilliantly
at
right
end
but
it
was
no
use
what
in
the
name
of
common
sense
impelled
their
coach
to
put
sir
john
falstaff
at
center
the
day
has
gone
by
when
weight
is
the
only
consideration
in
that
position
moreover
you
can
not
train
for
football
on
sack
and
capons
ursus
made
the
old
knight
look
like
thirty
cents
in
counterfeit
money
luckily
he
was
taken
out
at
the
end
of
the
first
period
wheezing
badly
and
hercules
took
his
place
the
game
ended
as
might
have
been
expected
to
in
favor
of
achilles
team
the
football
game
had
occupied
most
of
the
morning
but
after
it
was
over
there
was
still
time
for
the
spectators
to
witness
some
minor
contests
before
luncheon
many
wandered
over
to
the
tennis
courts
a
set
of
mixed
doubles
was
in
progress
with
lady
macbeth
and
wilson
opposed
by
morgan
le
fay
and
isaacs
the
queen
of
scotland
and
her
partner
from
missouri
took
a
love
set
at
the
beginning
of
the
match
but
the
second
set
was
hotly
contested
and
finally
went
to
morgan
le
fay
and
isaacs
morgan
le
fay
won
ace
after
ace
proving
herself
the
mistress
of
a
very
powerful
and
puzzling
service
while
isaacs
covered
the
court
with
the
agility
of
a
cat
they
took
the
final
set
and
the
match
winning
easily
with
a
score
of
gentlemen
singles
were
also
being
played
and
at
the
time
when
our
representative
had
to
leave
the
courts
the
tournament
was
practically
won
by
nathan
burke
as
the
only
undefeated
players
remaining
were
hugh
wynne
and
alfred
jingle
under
the
trees
near
by
some
games
of
cards
were
in
progress
miss
lily
bart
was
instructing
diana
of
the
crossways
major
pendennis
and
pickwick
in
auction
bridge
horatius
hearing
the
word
bridge
mentioned
hurried
over
to
the
table
but
when
he
saw
what
was
going
on
lost
his
interest
and
walked
away
toward
the
golf
links
with
sir
patrick
spens
at
another
table
john
oakhurst
seemed
to
have
obliterated
the
for
he
was
deeply
engaged
in
a
game
of
poker
with
rev
johnsing
and
brother
cyanide
whiffles
of
the
thompson
street
poker
club
everybody
was
interested
in
aviation
and
when
the
rumor
got
about
that
the
aviators
were
going
to
make
some
flights
there
was
a
general
rush
toward
the
hangars
only
three
made
ascents
however
darius
green
icarus
and
peter
pan
the
first
tried
one
of
his
celebrated
spiral
descents
and
of
course
came
to
the
ground
with
a
crash
his
machine
was
a
total
wreck
icarus
did
not
have
much
better
luck
he
was
carried
off
to
the
hospital
he
rose
to
an
enormous
height
and
is
said
to
have
beaten
all
previous
records
for
altitude
but
something
went
wrong
with
his
biplane
and
he
fell
with
terrible
force
king
arthur
his
duties
as
umpire
of
the
football
game
finished
challenged
macbeth
to
nine
holes
of
golf
and
beat
the
scottish
king
on
his
own
heath
so
to
speak
king
arthur
drives
were
magnificent
showing
that
the
arm
that
once
wielded
excalibur
had
not
weakened
since
its
owner
retirement
to
the
island
valley
of
avilion
they
play
very
classy
golf
in
avilion
macbeth
putts
were
beautiful
to
watch
but
as
he
usually
arrived
on
the
green
in
at
least
two
strokes
more
than
the
monarch
of
the
round
table
they
did
him
very
little
good
twice
on
the
drive
he
sliced
and
the
ball
went
wide
into
a
grove
of
trees
when
he
asked
his
caddie
the
name
of
the
grove
and
the
youth
replied
birnam
wood
your
majesty
the
former
thane
of
cawdor
turned
pale
and
hammered
the
ground
with
his
brassie
when
the
royal
players
came
to
the
ninth
tee
macbeth
was
heard
to
mutter
what
though
i
foozle
top
and
slice
and
thou
opposed
be
now
three
up
yet
will
i
try
the
last
lay
on
mac
i
mean
it
your
honor
arthur
king
arthur
did
the
difficult
ninth
hole
in
bogey
but
poor
old
macbeth
plowed
up
the
turf
all
along
the
fair
green
and
finally
holed
out
amid
a
burst
of
scotch
profanity
sad
to
hear
neither
of
their
queens
was
present
her
majesty
of
scotland
being
engaged
as
we
have
said
on
the
tennis
courts
while
queen
guinevere
well
it
is
enough
for
anyone
to
read
the
of
one
of
the
football
teams
to
know
that
queen
guinevere
was
still
lingering
around
the
clubhouse
waiting
for
the
players
to
come
out
we
have
no
wish
to
mention
unpleasant
things
and
we
abhor
scandals
still
facts
are
facts
and
it
is
the
duty
of
a
conscientious
newspaper
to
record
them
down
on
the
lake
that
expert
submarine
navigator
captain
nemo
was
entertaining
a
large
crowd
by
the
maneuvers
of
his
celebrated
boat
the
nautilus
and
an
exhibition
of
skillful
paddling
was
offered
by
hiawatha
in
his
canoe
the
sound
of
revolver
shots
drew
a
number
of
spectators
to
see
a
match
between
sherlock
holmes
and
the
virginian
the
greatest
throng
however
surrounded
a
fencing
bout
between
cyrano
de
bergerac
and
cyrano
had
some
dispute
with
the
referee
before
beginning
on
the
question
of
whether
he
should
be
allowed
to
compose
a
poem
while
he
was
fencing
he
alleged
that
it
was
his
custom
to
do
so
and
that
he
could
not
possibly
appear
at
his
best
if
the
privilege
were
denied
his
opponent
objected
however
just
a
ballade
monsieur
pleaded
cyrano
or
at
least
a
vilanelle
cut
out
the
poet
business
cy
shouted
someone
it
is
suspected
that
chimmie
fadden
was
the
man
and
the
referee
so
ruled
was
declared
the
winner
of
the
match
that
followed
after
luncheon
the
whole
assemblage
were
gathered
about
the
diamond
for
the
long
expected
game
of
baseball
this
was
to
be
played
between
two
scrub
teams
known
as
the
boys
and
the
old
men
though
some
of
the
latter
notably
romeo

more
in

huck
however
began
to
look
better
and
after
the
fourth
he
was
swinging
the
ball
over
in
great
shape
the
old

made
but
two
hits
in
the
last
seven
innings
and
none
in

star

himself
came

with

tally

proved

the
greatest
difference
came
in
the
defensive
work
of
the
teams
the
boys
went
through
without
a
break
tom
jones
had
a
case
of
the
wabbles
for
the

there
was
a
lot
of

floating

off

light
as
soon
as
he
had
examined
the
papers
which
are
slightly
damaged
by

he
perceived
their
bearing
upon
an
important
literary
question
of
the
day
and
very
properly
sent
them
to
the

the
original

the
following
remarkable
statement
i
professor
horatio
fassett
write
this
appeal
with
a
perfectly
detestable
on
an
uninhabited
and
so
far
as
i
am
aware
unknown
island
somewhere
off
the
eastern
coast
of
south
america
on
as
near
as
i
can
guess
the
twelfth
of
december
for
two
years
have
i
dwelt
in
wretchedness
in
this
place
a
most
unwilling
and
unsuccessful
follower
of
robinson
crusoe
i
know
that
it
is
customary
in
such
appeals
as
this
which
i
am
about
in
the
words
of
the
burial
service
to
commit
to
the
deep
to
give
approximately
at
least
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
my
desert
isle
in
order
that
searching
parties
which
i
earnestly
pray
may
be
sent
for
me
shall
know
where
to
look
alas
all
my
studies
have
been
devoted
to
literature
and
the
fine
arts
and
although
i
have
certain
instruments
which
poor
captain
bucko
used
to
ascertain
the
ship
position
i
am
as
helpless
with
them
as
an
infant
true
i
have
endeavored
to
look
at
the
sun
with
them
and
the
moon
too
but
i
could
not
observe
that
those
bodies
had
any
than
their
usual
aspect
when
thus
viewed
as
for
the
signs
which
are
engraved
on
the
surface
of
these
instruments
i
could
copy
them
down
here
in
hope
that
they
might
give
a
clue
to
those
expert
in
navigation
but
as
they
are
so
far
as
i
can
see
exactly
the
same
as
those
which
were
on
the
instruments
when
we
left
new
york
i
fear
it
would
be
of
no
avail
the
only
hint
then
of
the
geographical
position
of
this
island
must
come
from
my
narrative
i
beseech
whatever
person
finds
it
to
send
news
of
me
without
delay
to
the
president
and
faculty
of
upidee
university
where
alas
i
suppose
my
chair
the
james
rewbarb
professorship
of
german
literature
is
already
filled
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
speak
much
of
my
career
in
the
obituary
notices
that
doubtless
appeared
when
the
ship
hardtack
failed
to
arrive
at
valparaiso
i
suppose
it
was
stated
that
i
was
the
only
passenger
on
that
unfortunate
vessel
i
am
i
believe
the
only
survivor
of
her
wreck
worn
out
with
revising
proof
of
the
second
edition
of
my
doctor
thesis
that
the
umlaut
should
be
placed
of
a
millimetre
higher
than
is
now
the
custom
i
had
at
the
advice
of
my
physician
embarked
on
the
hardtack
sailing
from
new
york
for
valparaiso
the
voyage
was
uneventful
for
about
four
weeks
and
life
on
the
ship
which
i
think
by
the
way
was
called
by
the
captain
a
brig
was
not
distasteful
to
me
one
morning
however
i
heard
a
commotion
overhead
and
going
upstairs
found
captain
bucko
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
i
asked
him
the
cause
and
he
replied
that
the
mate
had
put
the
brig
in
irons
i
had
often
read
of
this
custom
in
times
of
mutiny
so
i
remarked
i
suppose
it
was
by
your
orders
captain
he
did
not
reply
and
i
presently
learned
the
cause
of
his
anxiety
they
did
not
seem
to
be
able
to
make
the
ship
go
ahead
in
a
straight
line
and
to
make
matters
worse
a
rocky
island
on
which
the
waves
were
breaking
violently
had
been
discovered
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
vessel
i
ought
to
explain
that
i
am
not
perfectly
familiar
with
all
the
technicalities
of
and
i
retain
only
a
confused
idea
of
what
followed
i
know
that
i
was
ordered
to
get
into
a
small
rowboat
which
was
jumping
about
in
a
most
alarming
fashion
at
one
side
of
the
ship
and
that
when
i
refused
to
take
such
a
ridiculous
step
i
was
seized
by
two
sailors
and
thrown
into
the
boat
i
must
have
struck
my
head
on
something
for
i
knew
nothing
else
until
i
found
myself
lying
on
a
beach
pounded
and
bruised
by
the
waves
i
got
up
and
staggered
to
a
place
where
the
sand
was
dry
and
there
i
fell
again
exhausted
of
the
captain
and
the
crew
of
the
hardtack
i
have
never
seen
a
trace
except
a
coat
belonging
to
the
mate
which
was
washed
on
shore
a
few
days
later
their
small
boat
was
probably
tipped
over
by
the
waves
and
they
were
all
drowned
it
is
strange
that
i
the
only
one
of
them
unfamiliar
with
the
ocean
should
have
been
spared
the
hardtack
itself
evidently
became
hitched
on
a
rock
some
little
distance
from
the
shore
for
there
it
stayed
for
part
of
that
day
with
great
waves
beating
upon
it
at
last
the
masts
fell
down
and
in
a
few
days
the
ship
was
broken
in
pieces
till
nothing
remained
many
of
these
fragments
floated
to
the
shore
with
various
articles
from
the
cargo
for
the
first
three
days
i
was
excessively
miserable
i
was
forced
to
sleep
out
of
doors
on
the
first
night
and
when
i
felt
hungry
the
next
morning
there
was
nothing
to
eat
my
tastes
are
simple
but
my
habits
are
regular
and
in
my
rooms
at
upidee
as
well
as
in
the
hardtack
i
was
accustomed
to
have
a
cup
of
coffee
at
seven
each
morning
now
i
searched
the
shore
for
some
hours
but
could
find
nothing
except
some
mussels
or
clams
and
a
few
starfish
the
starfish
were
very
tough
and
not
at
all
agreeable
in
taste
and
though
a
little
neck
clam
properly
iced
and
served
with
lemon
and
other
condiments
is
not
an
ill
beginning
to
a
dinner
i
can
not
pretend
that
i
found
these
shellfish
eaten
raw
on
a
windy
beach
other
than
nauseous
but
i
hasten
over
these
troubles
and
also
over
my
discovery
of
a
large
number
of
boxes
of
food
which
floated
ashore
three
days
later
from
the
wreck
some
of
it
was
edible
and
it
sufficed
until
i
found
other
means
of
sustenance
on
the
island
of
my
discovery
of
two
deserted
huts
relics
of
former
castaways
perhaps
of
my
domestication
of
several
wild
goats
whom
i
learned
not
without
difficulty
to
milk
and
of
my
capture
of
fish
in
the
inlet
of
all
these
things
i
need
not
write
my
troubles
are
not
material
but
intellectual
and
they
are
so
great
that
i
earnestly
implore
some
one
to
come
to
my
rescue
to
make
my
sufferings
clear
i
must
remind
the
reader
that
i
am
that
horatio
fassett
who
won
the
prize
from
somebody
magazine
four
years
ago
for
the
best
answer
to
the
question
if
you
were
cast
away
on
a
desert
island
what
one
hundred
books
would
you
prefer
to
have
with
you
i
worked
hard
to
compile
my
list
and
it
was
generally
agreed
to
be
the
most
scholarly
selection
of
one
hundred
titles
ever
made
the
publishers
of
somebody
magazine
not
only
paid
me
the
but
presented
me
with
a
copy
well
bound
of
each
of
the
books
these
packed
securely
in
a
box
so
constructed
as
to
float
accompanied
me
in
the
hardtack
and
i
need
tell
no
scholar
that
during
my
first
days
on
this
island
as
i
walked
the
beach
and
watched
the
remnants
of
the
vessel
float
ashore
it
was
not
so
much
for
cases
of
concentrated
soup
nor
tins
of
that
i
yearned
as
for
my
box
of
the
one
hundred
best
books
at
last
it
came
that
was
a
happy
day
about
a
week
after
my
arrival
on
the
island
i
saw
the
box
tossed
about
in
the
surf
and
i
dashed
in
and
secured
it
i
was
now
living
with
comparative
comfort
in
one
of
the
huts
and
thither
i
carried
the
books
i
was
overjoyed
it
was
my
privilege
to
put
my
books
to
the
test
something
that
had
never
been
accorded
to
the
compilers
of
any
of
the
similar
lists
which
have
been
made
in
such
profusion
with
trembling
hands
and
a
screwdriver
i
opened
the
box
and
took
out
the
books
they
were
in
perfect
order
the
waterproof
box
had
been
well
made
from
this
point
i
copy
the
entries
in
my
diary
and
let
them
tell
the
rest
of
my
dismal
story
i
arranged
the
books
neatly
this
afternoon
on
top
of
some
empty
biscuit
boxes
they
were
all
there
tasso
homer
don
quixote
the
divine
comedy
browning
and
the
rest
they
looked
delightful
and
reminded
me
of
my
study
at
upidee
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
see
that
study
again
and
i
wonder
what
will
become
of
the
second
edition
of
my
thesis
on
the
umlaut
it
was
to
appear
next
april
and
now
who
knows
whether
i
shall
be
there
ready
to
reply
to
the
attacks
which
i
know
it
will
provoke
from
this
gloomy
line
of
thought
i
turned
again
to
the
hundred
best
books
which
should
i
begin
to
read
there
were
my
beloved
goethe
and
schiller
should
i
start
with
them
i
took
a
volume
and
had
opened
it
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
not
yet
gone
that
day
to
the
high
rock
where
i
looked
for
passing
ships
i
put
goethe
back
on
the
biscuit
box
and
spent
an
anxious
afternoon
staring
at
the
ocean
but
i
saw
nothing
the
evening
i
spent
in
trying
to
arrange
some
fishing
lines
as
the
firelight
my
only
illumination
is
not
favorable
for
reading
to
one
afflicted
with
astigmatism
i
miss
the
electric
droplight
that
i
used
at
upidee
or
even
the
kerosene
lamp
in
the
cabin
of
the
i
must
try
to
make
some
candles
i
passed
the
morning
in
trying
to
tame
a
wild
goat
or
perhaps
i
had
better
say
in
trying
to
induce
one
to
graze
outside
my
cabin
instead
of
investigating
the
interior
they
are
not
at
all
shy
but
are
inclined
to
be
rather
sociable
in
the
afternoon
i
took
goethe
with
me
to
the
high
rock
where
i
sat
with
the
volume
on
my
knee
keeping
a
watch
for
vessels
i
can
not
say
that
i
read
much
german
literature
makes
me
feel
rather
homesick
and
i
find
brings
me
recollections
of
the
distressing
recitations
of
last
year
freshman
class
when
i
went
to
the
lookout
i
took
browning
with
me
good
heavens
i
found
i
can
no
longer
read
browning
this
was
an
astounding
state
of
things
and
i
had
to
examine
myself
rather
sharply
i
remembered
that
i
had
never
for
a
moment
been
in
doubt
when
i
made
up
my
list
of
including
browning
i
had
read
twenty
years
ago
the
lyrics
with
the
greatest
of
pleasure
but
the
longer
poems
had
seemed
to
me
rather
dull
and
indeed
a
large
proportion
of
the
poet
work
was
intensely
irritating
to
me
on
account
of
its
needless
and
exasperating
obscurity
at
the
time
i
did
not
consider
this
a
cause
for
worry
browning
was
a
great
poet
everyone
said
so
his
treasures
did
not
lie
on
the
surface
one
must
dive
below
in
order
to
find
the
rich
pearls
which
lay
concealed
there
i
remember
using
this
metaphor
in
a
lecture
that
i
delivered
before
the
woman
club
of
buffalo
i
had
always
intended
to
study
the
longer
poems
but
i
had
never
done
it
now
they
were
unreadable
to
me
as
for
the
lyrics
they
did
not
charm
me
as
formerly
i
found
myself
longing
for
a
volume
of
wordsworth
or
tennyson
neither
was
included
in
my
best
books
though
i
can
not
see
now
for
the
life
of
me
why
i
did
include
tennyson
could
it
have
been
because
his
poems
are
easy
to
understand
and
that
i
thought
it
would
seem
more
to
put
in
browning
i
have
not
been
to
the
high
rock
lately
except
for
a
brief
visit
after
breakfast
i
have
had
a
little
rheumatism
not
being
used
to
sleeping
in
draughty
cabins
the
goats
have
been
a
source
of
entertainment
to
me
and
i
have
caught
some
crabs
which
i
keep
in
a
little
pool
of
salt
water
near
the
cabin
they
are
amusing
to
watch
and
toasted
is
far
from
bad
at
supper
time
i
kill
one
with
a
stick
and
then
broil
him
on
a
hot
stone
yesterday
i
tried
reading
again
but
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
there
was
not
much
solace
in
it
the
odyssey
i
soon
put
down
too
much
shipwreck
and
wandering
in
strange
lands
there
is
no
penelope
waiting
for
me
even
if
i
ever
get
home
alive
and
the
thought
of
ithaca
reminded
me
of
cornell
and
professor
von
füglemann
who
is
all
ready
to
tear
my
thesis
on
the
umlaut
to
pieces
shakspeare
i
picked
up
but
the
first
play
i
opened
to
was
tempest
i
closed
shakspeare
and
put
him
back
nothing
has
happened
worth
recording
for
weeks
once
i
saw
smoke
from
a
steamboat
i
suppose
but
smoke
did
not
do
me
any
good
there
is
something
the
matter
with
this
list
of
best
books
for
one
thing
they
are
most
of
them
so
tragic
i
would
give
anything
for
a
volume
of
dooley
but
that
is
not
all
i
have
always
realized
that
the
great
literature
of
the
world
is
very
largely
sombre
and
i
have
no
more
sympathy
now
than
i
ever
had
with
the
people
who
want
to
read
nothing
but
that
which
keeps
them
on
a
broad
grin
even
in
my
dreary
situation
i
could
read
tragedy
but
i
have
brought
precious
little
tragedy
that
i
care
for
no
doubt
most
of
my
books
are
great
monuments
of
literature
but
i
am
afraid
i
must
have
forgotten
when
i
wrote
my
list
how
few
of
these
books
i
read
now
i
must
have
put
them
in
because
they
are
praised
by
writers
of
and
because
it
seemed
the
proper
thing
to
do
as
i
go
over
my
reading
for
the
past
five
years
at
upidee
in
what
do
i
find
it
to
consist
first
the
literature
and
of
my
profession
second
current
books
history
biography
art
criticism
and
an
infrequent
novel
or
book
of
verse
there
are
not
many
living
novelists
or
poets
that
i
care
about
it
makes
me
fairly
rage
when
i
think
that
i
hesitated
between
and
when
i
made
up
my
list
and
finally
decided
in
favor
of
the
latter
as
more
weighty
which
it
certainly
is
i
used
my
copy
to
help
sink
a
lobster
trap
the
other
day
almost
the
only
novel
which
i
condescended
to
include
in
my
list
is
quixote
and
why
did
i
do
that
because
it
has
been
praised
for
three
hundred
years
i
suppose
instead
of
for
only
forty
or
fifty
it
is
about
the
only
humorous
work
which
i
did
include
and
except
for
places
here
and
there
it
is
a
dreary
waste
it
is
now
months
since
i
have
had
the
courage
to
face
this
diary
i
dreamed
last
night
that
i
had
wandered
into
a
book
shop
there
were
rows
of
books
for
any
one
of
which
i
would
have
gladly
given
my
whole
celebrated
one
hundred
at
least
i
would
give
what
is
left
of
them
quixote
has
been
used
to
paste
over
cracks
in
the
walls
of
my
cabin
furioso
served
to
boil
some
eggs
one
morning
for
breakfast
when
i
was
short
of
firewood
and
the
fell
into
the
fire
one
night
when
i
hurled
it
at
some
animal
a
fox
i
think
that
came
into
the
hut
the
sight
of
that
bookshop
made
me
weep
i
had
seized
a
volume
of
tennyson
stevenson
letters
and
holmes
when
the
shopkeeper
jumped
over
his
counter
at
me
and
i
woke
sobbing
one
of
the
goats
ate
the
æneid
the
goat
is
ill
and
i
have
had
to
give
it
one
of
my
few
pepsin
tablets
this
is
the
last
entry
from
the
diary
that
i
need
transcribe
over
a
year
has
elapsed
since
i
wrote
it
and
my
case
is
desperate
i
will
now
seal
up
this
narrative
in
a
bottle
and
throw
it
into
the
sea
come
to
my
rescue
or
i
fear
i
shall
go
mad
the
conversation
room
the
conversation
room
to
the
honorable
the
board
of
directors
of
the
blankville
public
library
gentlemen
i
am
forced
to
lay
my
complaint
before
you
because
your
librarian
pierce
so
i
am
told
has
sailed
for
europe
to
attend
a
meeting
of
librarians
in
brussels
whence
he
will
not
return
for
six
or
seven
weeks
my
name
is
doubtless
familiar
to
you
but
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
i
am
engaged
in
an
important
piece
of
research
in
your
library
when
i
state
that
my
work
is
an
inquiry
into
the
origins
of
the
noun
and
its
possible
derivation
from
the
semitic
you
will
understand
that
it
requires
the
closest
possible
application
and
an
entire
freedom
from
interruptions
and
distractions
when
i
began
my
researches
in
your
library
six
days
ago
i
presented
letters
to
pierce
he
very
kindly
installed
me
in
an
alcove
where
he
had
placed
a
table
and
chairs
and
where
he
allowed
me
to
assemble
the
books
needed
in
my
studies
some
one
hundred
and
thirty
or
forty
volumes
these
together
with
my
papers
and
writing
materials
are
permitted
to
remain
on
the
table
from
one
day
to
another
as
obviously
it
would
be
inconvenient
for
me
to
have
to
call
for
them
each
morning
it
is
my
custom
to
begin
work
at
nine
every
day
and
to
continue
save
for
an
hour
at
noon
until
for
a
few
days
all
went
very
well
and
i
was
making
fair
progress
in
my
work
but
during
the
last
two
days
and
particularly
yesterday
i
have
been
subjected
to
such
annoyances
that
all
of
my
studies
have
been
held
at
a
standstill
the
library
and
particularly
the
remote
part
of
it
in
which
my
alcove
is
situated
has
been
little
frequented
during
this
hot
weather
yesterday
however
an
invasion
began
the
alcove
next
to
mine
was
visited
by
a
succession
of
incongruous
inconsequent
persons
whose
conversation
made
it
utterly
impossible
for
me
to
work
a
complaint
to
miss
mayhew
the
assistant
in
charge
of
the
library
elicited
the
fact
that
conversation
is
allowed
in
this
alcove
it
is
out
of
the
question
for
me
to
move
my
work
as
an
inspection
of
the
building
has
shown
that
there
is
no
other
spot
where
the
light
suits
my
eyes
yesterday
afternoon
totally
unable
to
do
any
serious
work
i
took
down
in
shorthand
the
stream
of
driveling
talk
that
occurred
in
that
alcove
i
now
transcribe
it
here
in
order
that
your
honorable
board
may
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
the
nature
of
the
interruptions
to
which
i
am
subjected
after
giving
them
due
consideration
i
trust
that
you
will
be
able
to
take
action
in
the
matter
in
the
meanwhile
my
philological
researches
are
of
necessity
suspended
i
returned
to
my
work
after
luncheon
at
two
the
alcove
next
mine
was
occupied
by
two
persons
a
young
man
and
woman
both
about
twenty
years
of
age
their
talk
reached
me
and
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
follow
any
consecutive
line
of
thought
at
the
time
when
i
began
to
take
down
their
conversation
the
young
woman
was
saying
what
people
are
always
talking
about
reading
gibbon
and
then
they
look
awfully
wise
i
never
dared
to
ask
what
they
mean
oh
it
gibbon
history

you

read
it
great
scott
no
it
in
about
a
dozen
volumes
i
do
know
how
many
i
read

of
it
they
made

it
pretty
fierce
nothing
to
grote
though
grote
of
greece
that
the
limit
gibbon
is
a
man
then
i
was
sure
what
he
was
yes
he
the
author
oh
why
i
seen
him
how
stupid
of
me
i
saw
him
when
i
was
in
baltimore
visiting
the
ashfords
why
he
just
the
thing
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
he
came
at
the
end
of
a
great
long
procession
with
the
dearest
little
at
the
head
and
he
was
all
in
scarlet
robes
and
a
great
long
train
with
two
more
little
boys
holding
up
his
train
and
he
had
the
loveliest
lace
collar
i
just
went
crazy
over
him
and
i
saw
him
on
the
street
afterwards
too
only
he
did
have
on
his
scarlet
robes
then
he
had
on
black
clothes
and
a
tall
hat
and
when
he
lifted
his
hat
to
someone
he
had
on
a
little
red
underneath
it
oh
he
a
perfect
dear
i
like
to
read
his
book
i
wonder
if
they
got
it
here
no
no
that
not
the
man
this
was
an
englishman
his
first
name
was
i
forget
what
it
was
anyhow
he
been
dead
a
long
time
he
was
a
very
fat
man
and
he
proposed
to
mme
de
staël
or
george
sand
or
one
of
those
women
and
when
he
got
down
on
his
knees
he
was
so
fat
that
he
could
get
up
again
and
had
to
ask
her
to
help
him
up
how
perfectly
ridiculous
i
hate
fat
men
i
hope
she
did
accept
him
did
she
i
do
know
well
i
do
want
to
read
his
book
anyhow
but
i
simply
got
to
read
something
that
sounds
cultured
and
learned
aunt
ella
has
been
at
me
again
she
says
this
is
a
good
time
during
vacation
fanny
brooks
has
a
great
long
list
of
the
books
she
has
read
i
am
so
tired
of
having
fanny
brooks
thrown
at
me
she
never
reads
anything
interesting
or
does
anything
at
all
for
pleasure
she
ought
to
be
a
nun
ca
you
think
of
something
that
will
impress
aunt
ella
something
that
sounds
awfully
impressive
and
dry
and
cultured
but
really
is
easy
to
read
well
let
me
see
how
about
browning
i
read
him
like
him
no
it
seems
to
be
a
tough
proposition
what
does
your
aunt
ella
read

do
you
take
some
of
her
books

i
do
know
she
reads
of
the
renaissance

things
like
that

tried
to
read
some
of
hers
and
i
told
her
i
did
like
them
she
said
i
could
expect
to
because
i
have
any
foundation

do
you
get
a
foundation

what

sure

whereupon
these
two
nuisances
departed
really
it
seems
amazing
that
children
and
frivolous
persons
should
be
allowed
in
libraries
as
it
was
four
now
i
did
hope
to
be
allowed
to
study
in
peace
for
what
remained
of
the
afternoon
but
the
hope
was
vain
for
inside
of
five
minutes
two
women
came
into
that
alcove
that
cave
of
the
winds
as
i
may
call
it
they
apparently
brought
some
books
with
them
and
they
instantly
began
to
discuss
them
in
a
manner
that
drove
every
idea
from
my
head
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
but
to
record
their
talk
in
order
to
make
my
complaint
perfectly
clear
to
your
honorable
board
this
was
the
conversation
well
now
this
says
that
daniel
pingree
died
at
marblehead
in
if
that
so
how
under
the
sun
i
like
to
know
was
he
married
to
pamela
perkins
in
why
it
does
say
that
does
it
look
for
yourself
there
it
is
and
who
was
pamela
pingree
who
died
in
oh
she
was
his
i
got
her
traced
all
clear
enough
her
mother
was
a
jimson
they
lived
in
the
old
jimson
homestead
in
worcester
her
father
was
zachariah
jimson
and
he
was
my
ancestor
he
was
the
third
cousin
of
the
earl
of
dingleberry
i
got
into
the
dames
of
the
pequot
war
and
the
order
of
american
descendants
of
third
cousins
of
earls
both
of
them
through
zachariah
but
that
does
explain
how
molly
bixby
whose
mother
came
over
in
the
sarah
jane
from
bristol
and
who
settled
at
cohasset
in
turned
up
in
philadelphia
in
married
to
an
officer
in
the
english
army
then
i
am
nearly
distracted
about
jabez
whicher
he
was
an
intimate
friend
of
sir
harry
vane
and
i
do
see
how
i
can
ever
get
into
the
of
persons
who
were
acquainted
with
people
worth
unless
i
can
find
out
something

married
a
diddleback
my
grandfather
always
said
and
in
the
genealogies

most
prominent
families

court
records

townsfolk

ancestor

very
unusual
name

at
all
whicher
is
a
common
name
i
mean
that
is
i
mean
oh
of
course
this
is
some
one
else
i
can
not
chronicle
their
conversation
any
further
enough
has
been
given
to
show
you
the
nature
of
the
annoyances
to
which
i
was
subjected
yesterday
i
look
to
you
gentlemen
for
relief
yours
very
truly
obadiah
wurzberger
to
the
board
of
directors
of
the
blankville
public
library
gentlemen
i
regret
to
hear
from
my
colleague
wurzberger
that
you
have
denied
his
application
for
relief
in
the
matter
of
conversation
within
the
library
alcoves
wurzberger
has
been
unable
to
work
for
over
a
week
on
account
of
the
disturbing
chatter
that
goes
on
in
the
alcove
next
to
his
and
yet
you
reply
that
conversation
has
always
been
allowed
there
and
that
you
do
not
see
your
way
to
forbidding
it
in
order
to
show
you
that
he
is
not
alone
in
finding
this
conversation
disturbing
i
wish
to
state
that
i
have
been
intolerably
annoyed
i
have
been
trying
to
work
in
the
alcove
on
the
other
side
of
the
one
where
the
talking
occurs
the
first
volume
of
my
arabic
dictionary
on
which
i
have
been
engaged
continuously
since
is
soon
to
appear
and
i
had
hoped
to
devote
a
few
weeks
to
a
final
revision
but
how
much
i
was
able
to
accomplish
for
instance
you
may
see
from
this
clack
and
chatter
which
took
place
within
eight
feet
of
me
the
first
to
begin
at
nine
were
two
youths
this
is
a
literal
account
of
what
they
said
when
is
the
exam
september
what
in
thunder
are
you
beginning
to
grind
now
for
why
we
are
going
to
start
for
squid
cove
day
after
and
we
always
stay
till
after
labor
day
of
course
i
sha
do
any
grinding
down
there
and
then
when
we
get
back
pete
brown
and
i
are
going
to
take
the
car
and
go
up
to
lake
george
for
the
rest
of
the
month
or
till
the
exam
anyhow
so
you
only
got
and
that
all
gee
what
does
the
course
cover
english
literature
from
beowulf
to
the
death
of
swinburne
know
anything
about
it
not
a
damned
thing
know
who
beowulf
was
no
i
thought
you
were
going
to
put
me
on
to
that
well
you
know
who
swinburne
was
do
you
sure
thing
he
wrote
blessed
damozel
snappy
work
old
man
you
came
pretty
near
it
anyhow
only
put
that
in
the
exam
you
wo
get
asked
many
questions
about
modern
writers
so
do
worry
over
them
perhaps
you
get
one
on
tennyson
do
say
he
lived
in
the
craigie
house
on
brattle
street
and
wrote
will
you
now
we
might
as
well
open
the
book
and
take
a
chance
anywhere
here
milton
ever
hear
of
him
john
milton
england
greatest
epic
poet
was
the
son
of
a
scrivener
he
was
born
in
in
grub
street
london
he
lived
there
till
he
was
sixteen
so
it
is
possible
that
his
youthful
eyes
may
have
beheld
shakspeare
his
only
superior
he
well
well
where
did
you
get
all
this
wait
a
minute
little
did
his
worthy
parents
realize
that
their
son
was
destined
to
write
some
of
the
most
charming
lyrics
the
most
powerful
sonnets
and
the
greatest
epic
in
the
english
language
and
to
lose
his
sight
in
in
oh
i
forget
what
he
lost
his
sight
in
but
say
how
is
that
learned
it
this
morning
while
i
was
eating
breakfast
marvelous
but
what
was
that
about
grub
street
this
book
says
bread
street
yes
that
right
bread
street
knew
it
was
something
about
grub
well
you
better
cut
all
that
out
about
the
street
you
might
get
mixed
again
and
put
it
pudding
lane
it
does
make
a
hit
anyhow
they
would
rather
have
some
drool
about
his
influence
on
literature
or
something
of
that
sort
they
probably
ask
you
to
contrast
with
penseroso
or
describe
his
attitude
toward
the
presbyterians
or
that
all
right
i
there
with
the
goods
describes
the
life
of
the
happy
man
the
philosophy
falsely
attributed
to
the
followers
of
epicurus
which
is
summed
up
in
the
maxim
drink
and
be
merry
more
completely
described
in
the
rubaiyat
of
omar
khayyam
penseroso
on
the
other
hand
is
the
thoughtful
sober
student
by
no
means
to
be
confounded
with
the
melancholy
man
but
on
the
other
hand
oh
i
got
that
down
cold
i
can
go
on
that
way
for
three
pages
we
let
milton
alone
then
you
seem
to
know
everything
to
be
known
about
him
how
are
you
on
swift
addison
and
that
crowd
they
always
give
you
three
or
four
questions
about
them
i
got
to
read
over
what
that
book
says
on
that
period
i
am
not
very
sure
whether
swift
or
defoe
wrote
the
and
those
other
things
they
all
mixed
up
in
my
mind
anyway
how
about
shakspeare
oh
yes
no
one
knows
when
he
was
born
or
died
what
he
did
or
whether
he
wrote
his
plays
or
not
you
get
in
trouble
if
you
say
that
i
do
believe
you
will
get
any
question
about
him
here
jane
austen
she
was
the
woman
that
was
married
three
or
four
times
and
ought
to
have
been
two
or
three
other
times
was
she
no
you
mixed
her
with
someone
else
you
ought
to
be
able
to
discuss
her
style
and
compare
it
with
charlotte
bronte
dippy
about
jane
out
there
so
be
sure
and
read
her
up
and
do
fail
to
express
great
admiration
for
spenser
if
you
get
a
chance
was
he
the
fellow
who
said
we
were
all
descended
from
monkeys
no
no
what
are
you
talking
about
he
was
a
poet
time
of
shakspeare
or
about
then
you
ought
to
read
some
of
him
read
some
of
shepherd
calendar
and
quote
from
it
you
hate
it
but
it
will
work
a
great
swipe
with
the
examiner
well
i
have
to
go
along
now
mighty
good
of
you
to
put
me
on
to
these
points
do
mention
it
let
see
swift
jane
austen
and
spenser
are
the
ducks
you
say
i
ought
to
look
up
yes
and
addison
and
marlowe
and
say
find
out
something
about
wordsworth
they
ask
about
his
attitude
toward
the
french
revolution
or
some
damfool
thing
like
that
all
right
i
will
what
was
his
attitude
toward
it
i
do
know
i
had
it
all
down
fine
once
when
i
took
that
exam
he
liked
it
or
else
he
did
i
forget
which
but
say
you
want
to
know
a
little
about
dryden
and
pope
too
dryden
and
pope
all
right
i
got
on
my
list
i
be
able
to
write
three
pages
about
both
of
before
i
go
to
bed
so
long
so
long
they
parted
but
the
alcove
was
empty
only
three
minutes
it
was
then
occupied
by
a
man
and
a
woman
the
woman
began
the
conversation
brooks
said
i
certainly
ought
to
consult
you
wigglesworth
she
said
your
knowledge
of
local
history
will
be
indispensable
to
us
now
i
wonder
if
i
understand
you
correctly
you
and
the
other
ladies
of
your
club
wish
to
give
a
pageant
illustrating
past
events
in
the
history
of
the
town
that
it
exactly
now
we
thought
it
would
be
so
nice
if
we
could
have
the
visit
of
lafayette
to
blankville
for
one
thing
i
am
to
be
the
marquise
de
lafayette
in
a
louis
quinze
gown
and
powdered
hair
ah
yes
and
your
husband
i
presume
will
represent
the
marquis
daniel
oh
dear
no
jones
would
never
take
any
interest
in
it
he
is
so
busy
you
know
peabody
will
be
lafayette
i
see
peabody
will
be
lafayette
i
suppose
of
course
that
you
wish
to
carry
out
the
pageant
with
due
regard
for
historical
accuracy
correctness
of
costume
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
oh
yes
certainly
that
is
what
will
make
it
so
charming
and
interesting
and
picturesque
and
er
er
educational
peabody
has
picked
out
his
costume
already
he
has
spent
hours
over
it
it
is
all
white
satin
shoes
a
jeweled
sword
and
a
powdered
wig
we
thought
we
would
represent
the
ball
given
to
the
marquis
and
marchioness
by
the
leading
citizens
of
the
town
then
we
could
have
a
minuet
you
know
peabody
dances
so
beautifully
ah
yes
i
see
only
one
objection
to
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
historical
truth
i
mean
lafayette
did
not
visit
blankville
on
his
first
sojourn
in
this
country
oh
would
that
make
any
difference
well
it
would
rather
i
do
see
why
well
for
one
thing
when
he
did
come
here
he
was
an
old
man
he
was
about
old
enough
to
be
peabody
grandfather
i
should
judge
oh
furthermore
there
was
no
ball
given
by
the
leading
citizens
and
no
minuet
but
there
must
have
been
something
there
was
the
selectmen
gathered
at
the
and
presented
an
address
of
welcome
well
why
could
we
have
that
undoubtedly
you
could
but
it
occurred
at
about
nine
on
a
rainy
night
lafayette
did
not
alight
from
his
coach
for
he
was
trying
to
get
on
to
fairfield
that
night
he
was
suffering
from
a
headache
and
not
only
had
on
a
nightcap
but
had
his
head
swathed
in
flannel
bandages
as
well
he
merely
put
out
his
head
for
a
moment
from
the
coach
window
took
the
address
thanked
the
selectmen
and
immediately
retired
from
view
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
about
this
for
abner
willcox
the
first
historian
of
blankville
was
one
of
the
selectmen
i
do
see
how
we
could
have
that
very
well
it
is
possible
that
you
could
persuade
peabody
to
appear
in
a
nightcap
and
flannel
bandages
but
from
what
i
know
of
the
young
man
i
should
think
it
extremely
doubtful
well
it
would
not
be
picturesque
possibly
not
but
it
would
be
historically
correct
which
is
even
better
i
do
not
think
so
i
do
not
believe
that
a
pageant
should
follow
the
facts
of
history
slavishly
the
object
is
to
reproduce
in
a
beautiful
manner
the
events
of
the
past
exactly
so
jones
i
have
no
objection
to
the
beauty
of
the
spectacle
but
if
the
historical
association
whose
president
and
representative
i
am
are
to
contribute
toward
the
pageant
i
must
insist
upon
some
regard
for
historical
truth
well
what
could
we
have
are
there
not
some
events
that
would
be
suitable
did
not
general
washington
and
washington
visit
our
town
they
did
not
they
seem
to
have
overlooked
it
was
there
never
an
indian
raid
yes
there
was
in
how
would
that
do
i
will
leave
you
to
judge
the
indians
there
were
three
of
them
were
all
intoxicated
they
endeavored
to
steal
a
horse
but
were
discovered
by
a
servant
girl
of
one
enoch
winslow
who
owned
the
horse
she
locked
them
up
in
the
barn
until
the
constable
could
come
and
take
them
to
the
village
jail
it
does
not
sound
very
dramatic
i
am
no
judge
of
what
is
or
is
not
dramatic
jones
i
merely
give
you
the
facts
possibly
you
might
like
to
represent
the
landing
of
the
first
settlers
yes
that
sounds
delightful
it
was
not
a
delightful
occasion
for
the
settlers
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
on
landing
they
were
instantly
attacked
by
mosquitoes
in
such
large
numbers
that
they
had
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
to
their
ship
perhaps
we
could
have
that
and
leave
out
the
mosquitoes
it
would
be
hard
to
have
them
anyway
that
would
be
impossible
madam
the
modern
school
of
history
of
which
i
am
a
follower
allows
the
omission
of
no
detail
which
makes
for
accuracy
perhaps
you
would
not
be
able
to
introduce
the
mosquitoes
though
it
might
be
managed
if
not
i
should
insist
that
the
persons
representing
the
settlers
beat
their
arms
and
hands
about
and
retreat
to
the
vessel
in
evident
distress
it
does
seem
hard
to
find
anything
i
must
go
now
i
hope
you
will
think
it
over
wigglesworth
good
morning
these
gentlemen
of
the
board
were
the
annoyances
i
suffered
can
you
do
nothing
to
remedy
this
state
of
things
respectfully
yours
nicholas
jasper
the
literary
zoo
the
literary
zoo
the
idea
is
not
exactly
original
i
complained
perhaps
not
gooch
replied
at
least
perhaps
it
is
wholly
original
in
a
general
sense
still
disregarding
what
private
collectors
may
have
done
i
am
sure
this
is
the
first
public
library
to
establish
a
annex
on
so
extensive
a
scale
we
aim
at
nothing
less
than
completeness
oh
that
is
what
you
call
it
a
annex
i
thought
i
had
heard
it
called
a
literary
zoo
we
think
the
other
name
a
little
more
dignified
that
is
what
it
will
be
termed
on
the
invitations
let
me
see
i
believe
i
sent
you
an
advance
invitation
they
are
not
to
be
issued
till
next
monday
he
had
sent
me
one
and
i
took
it
from
my
pocket
and
read
it
over
again
the
public
library
of
east
caraway
it
said
requests
the
honor
of
your
presence
at
the
opening
of
its
annex
thursday
september
at
ten
we
have
to
set
that
hour
gooch
explained
because
the
animals
are
so
much
brighter
then
in
the
afternoon
they
get
sleepy
and
at
four
which
is
feeding
time
they
are
noisy
and
quarrelsome
but
come
we
will
go
and
inspect
them
he
rose
and
led
the
way
out
of
his
office
we
went
through
the
delivery
room
where
a
dozen
or
twenty
people
were
waiting
for
books
and
out
through
the
stacks
to
the
door
of
the
big
wooden
annex
gooch
drew
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
and
unfastened
the
padlock
of
course
you
understand
said
he
as
he
pushed
back
the
heavy
doors
there
are
still
very
many
empty
cages
our
collection
is
about
what
we
hope
to
have
in
two
years
it
is
slow
work
and
most
of
the
specimens
are
obtained
only
after
long
research
and
difficult
negotiation
some
owners
of
the
most
desirable
animals
hold
them
at
prices
absolutely
prohibitive
to
a
library
like
ours
i
could
tell
you
of
haggling
and
bargaining
that
we
have
done
well
you
would
never
believe
for
instance
what
the
owner
of
the
horse
who
brought
the
news
from
ghent
to
aix
wants
for
him
and
as
for
circe
swine
there
are
only
two
of
them
extant
now
they
might
be
made
of
pure
gold
those
pigs
but
we
have
enough
animals
to
make
a
respectable
showing
on
opening
day
i
think
and
i
believe
the
collection
will
be
decidedly
educational
in
its
effects
gooch
has
a
firmer
trust
in
the
educational
value
of
many
things
than
i
have
been
able
to
share
but
i
looked
forward
with
great
interest
to
this
first
view
of
his
animals
this
section
is
devoted
to
birds
said
gooch
that
swan
floating
around
on
the
pool
is
the
one
who
was
once
an
ugly
duckling
the
cockatoo
on
the
perch
belonged
to
count
fosco
and
the
red
bird
is
of
course
the
kentucky
cardinal
one
moment
i
interposed
how
do
you
classify
your
animals
not
by
authors
i
take
it
gooch
looked
a
little
embarrassed
well
no
he
admitted
it
was
a
very
painful
thing
for
as
a
librarian
i
naturally
wished
to
do
everything
according
to
library
methods
but
it
was
absolutely
impossible
we
tried
it
and
we
had
some
harrowing
experiences
gooch
wiped
his
brow
with
his
handkerchief
the
kipling
section
was
a
perfect
pandemonium
in
no
time
he
went
on
there
was
a
terrific
battle
between
the
tiger
and
one
of
the
elephants
i
thought
the
whole
place
would
be
torn
to
pieces
we
got
them
separated
somehow
and
we
saw
then
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
classify
by
authors
in
some
cases
it
might
be
done
but
we
had
to
stick
to
one
system
or
another
so
we
adopted
the
usual
methods
of
the
zoölogical
museums
the
birds
by
themselves
the
carnivora
together
and
so
on
it
is
hardly
scholarly
i
know
but
we
had
to
do
it
i
could
not
deny
that
he
had
acted
for
the
best
by
way
of
changing
the
subject
i
asked
him
about
a
small
bird
of
inconspicuous
appearance
it
is
the
nightingale
that
inspired
john
keats
he
replied
he
sings
sometimes
on
moonlit
nights
i
can
tell
you
however
that
the
ode
is
better
than
his
song
the
raven
sitting
there
on
the
pallid
bust
of
pallas
you
will
recognize
without
any
difficulty
this
other
raven
belonged
to
barnaby
rudge
i
suppose
no
is
owned
by
a
private
collector
this
one
flew
and
croaked
ahead
of
queen
guinevere
when
she
fled
all
night
long
by
glimmering
waste
and
weald
and
heard
the
spirits
of
the
waste
and
weald
moan
as
she
fled
our
ravens
are
not
very
cheerful
birds
the
other
large
black
bird
is
solomon
caw
who
lived
in
kensington
gardens
there
at
the
edge
of
the
pool
stands
the
caliph
stork
and
this
hen
i
asked
that
is
who
was
once
the
object
of
attention
from
a
virginian
the
other
is
the
little
red
hin
you
will
be
able
to
make
an
addition
to
your
poultry
soon
i
remarked
what
do
you
mean
why
one
chantecler
will
we
i
do
know
we
do
go
in
for
every
animal
that
becomes
notorious
through
advertising
do
you
recognize
the
canary
little
nell
no
this
one
hung
in
the
cabin
of
the
brig
flying
scud
here
are
the
dogs
well
penned
you
see
i
did
intend
that
outrageous
pun
because
some
of
them
are
dangerous
this
is
wolf
who
once
belonged
to
rip
van
winkle
many
persons
have
the
impression
that
his
name
is
snider
the
bloodhound
is
one
of
those
which
pursued
eliza
across
the
ice
there
are
many
impostors
but
our
specimen
is
undoubtedly
genuine
and
the
stuffed
bloodhound
i
inquired
he
was
shot
with
a
bottle
of
daffy
elixir
by
micah
clarke
the
other
stuffed
dog
that
gigantic
black
one
is
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
of
course
i
interrupted
certainly
there
are
the
marks
of
sherlock
holmes
bullets
this
fox
terrier
who
is
so
lively
and
amiable
is
montmorency
who
once
went
on
a
trip
with
three
men
in
a
boat
this
stuffed
pug
who
looks
flattened
and
damaged
is
willoughby
who
was
killed
by
having
a
fallen
idol
tumble
on
him
the
enormous
bernard
is
porthos
who
belonged
to
peter
ibbetson
and
that
collie
once
had
the
extreme
honor
of
being
chased
about
in
the
snow
and
caught
by
van
bibber
we
walked
on
down
the
long
passage
with
cages
on
either
side
on
shelves
here
and
there
were
animals
dead
and
stuffed
it
had
been
impossible
to
procure
them
alive
gooch
pointed
out
a
fox
who
plainly
had
been
cut
in
two
the
stitches
where
the
taxidermist
sewed
him
together
were
easy
to
see
it
was
the
fox
so
the
librarian
told
me
killed
in
spain
by
the
brigadier
gerard
here
are
the
cats
announced
gooch
and
their
characters
vary
the
persian
kitten
who
is
chasing
her
tail
has
been
celebrated
in
rubaiyat
that
large
tom
is
not
named
tom
but
peter
he
once
had
some
painkiller
administered
to
him
by
tom
sawyer
the
disagreeable
looking
creature
belonged
to
wilde
the
repairer
of
reputations
in
king
in
yellow
perhaps
you
recognize
the
other
it
must
be
the
black
cat
i
exclaimed
it
is
indeed
said
gooch
before
we
look
at
the
horses
i
want
you
to
come
into
this
little
room
the
collection
here
is
unique
it
can
not
be
approached
by
any
other
in
the
world
this
large
cage
is
intended
for
the
jabberwock
when
we
obtain
him
in
the
meanwhile
here
are
some
mome
raths
a
sort
of
green
pig
who
has
lost
his
way
you
know
two
borogoves
and
a
slithy
tove
i
gazed
with
feelings
of
deep
emotion
on
the
slithy
tove
something
like
a
badger
something
like
a
lizard
and
something
like
a
corkscrew
the
two
borogoves
who
were
both
very
mimsy
indeed
did
not
belie
their
reputation
for
looking
like
live
mops
this
room
is
admirable
have
you
any
other
animals
in
it
yes
gooch
replied
here
is
the
pobble
who
has
no
toes
the
genuine
pobble
absolutely
genuine
the
veritable
pobble
who
went
to
fish
for
his
aunt
jobiska
runcible
cat
with
crimson
whiskers
over
there
you
can
see
the
griffin
who
once
carried
a
minor
canon
on
his
back
and
beside
him
i
saw
a
large
and
bird
seated
in
a
chair
in
a
state
of
deep
dejection
and
invalidism
his
head
was
tied
up
as
if
he
were
very
surely
that
is
the
cockalorum
gooch
nodded
follow
me
please
this
room
he
opened
a
door
that
led
into
what
seemed
to
be
a
vast
and
absolutely
empty
apartment
this
room
contains
a
snark
and
the
invisible
dog
who
figured
in
the
stories
of
three
burglars
beyond
are
some
of
the
animals
who
once
lived
on
a
certain
island
with
one
moreau
would
you
like
to
see
them
i
shuddered
and
declined
very
well
then
we
will
return
to
the
main
building
we
did
so
and
the
librarian
paused
beside
a
small
case
here
is
the
gold
bug
this
caterpillar
is
the
one
that
sergeant
troy
removed
on
the
tip
of
his
sword
from
the
dress
of
bathsheba
everdene
and
the
bees
were
of
the
swarm
that
traveled
about
with
the
bee
man
of
orn
the
two
cages
beyond
both
contained
large
apes
our
remarked
gooch
have
decidedly
bad
reputations
the
one
on
the
right
committed
the
murders
in
the
rue
morgue
the
other
is
called
bimi
he
belonged
to
a
frenchman
named
bertran
the
next
cage
has
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
bander
log
oh
here
are
some
horses
and
cattle
the
pony
once
belonged
to
tom
bailey
this
donkey
was
one
of
those
which
used
to
annoy
miss
betsy
trotwood
priscilla
alden
on
her
rode
on
this
white
bull
the
stuffed
donkey
is
the
one
whose
dead
body
lay
once
in
the
pathway
of
a
traveler
on
a
sentimental
journey
and
the
other
donkey
was
the
of
the
luck
of
roaring
camp
i
pointed
to
some
enormous
and
crabs
that
were
crawling
about
on
the
sand
at
the
edge
of
a
tank
and
asked
what
they
were
the
librarian
told
me
that
they
were
from
the
subterranean
river
over
which
allan
quatermain
and
his
friends
traveled
but
they
said
gooch
are
nothing
to
the
fellow
in
the
next
tank
i
looked
where
he
indicated
and
saw
the
most
hideous
monster
it
has
ever
been
my
bad
luck
to
come
across
it
was
a
tremendous
crab
the
creature
of
a
nightmare
it
is
one
of
those
found
on
the
shores
of
the
future
by
the
traveler
who
voyaged
on
the
time
machine
i
think
i
have
had
enough
of
your
aquariums
i
said
just
look
at
this
here
is
the
jumping
frog
of
calaveras
county
whose
name
was
daniel
webster
he
has
recovered
from
his
meal
of
birdshot
and
can
jump
surprisingly
oh
and
over
there
is
the
crocodile
who
swallowed
an
alarm
clock
gooch
stopped
before
a
row
of
elephants
who
were
swaying
about
eating
hay
and
requesting
peanuts
i
was
shown
moti
guj
the
mutineer
and
the
elephant
on
whose
back
private
mulvaney
once
went
for
a
ride
there
was
also
zenobia
who
fell
in
love
with
a
country
doctor
and
her
ladyship
elephant
there
were
a
number
of
tigers
including
of
course
the
shere
khan
the
one
in
the
second
cage
said
my
guide
is
one
of
those
hunted
by
isaacs
when
he
was
after
a
to
present
to
miss
westonhaugh
but
perhaps
the
most
interesting
of
all
was
one
which
so
gooch
told
me
had
been
confined
in
a
cage
beside
a
lady
apartment
to
await
the
opening
of
a
door
by
a
young
man
but
gooch
was
unable
to
tell
me
whether
the
man
opened
the
door
of
the
lady
or
the
tiger
among
the
lions
i
saw
the
beast
which
fought
with
a
crocodile
in
the
presence
of
leo
vincey
and
horace
holly
a
black
panther
was
recognizable
as
bagheera
and
another
of
the
normal
color
was
the
same
animal
who
conceived
a
passion
for
a
french
soldier
in
the
desert
here
are
some
smaller
animals
said
gooch
do
you
know
this
fellow
with
the
sharp
nose
it
is
a
mongoose
is
it
not
yes
himself
and
these
white
mice
belonged
to
count
fosco
like
the
cockatoo
this
mouse
alone
by
herself
was
the
pet
of
barty
josselin
we
moved
on
but
i
began
to
look
at
my
watch
for
i
had
a
train
to
catch
the
snakes
are
an
especially
fine
part
of
the
collection
gooch
remarked
do
you
see
this
swamp
adder
it
is
the
speckled
band
that
gave
sherlock
holmes
an
uncomfortable
five
minutes
that
little
coral
snake
in
the
pickle
bottle
was
responsible
for
the
death
of
one
reingelder
the
two
rattlesnakes
were
intimates
of
elsie
venner
and
in
that
cage
you
may
see
kaa
the
great
rock
python
but
here
is
a
greater
prize
than
any
he
indicated
an
extraordinary
and
beautiful
serpent
at
which
i
looked
with
the
greatest
surprise
and
wonder
she
was
a
gordian
shape
of
dazzling
hue
golden
green
and
blue
striped
like
a
zebra
freckled
like
a
pard
eyed
like
a
peacock
and
all
crimson
barred
and
full
of
silver
moons
that
as
she
breathed
dissolved
or
brighter
shone
or
their
lustres
with
the
gloomier
tapestries
so
touched
with
miseries
she
seemed
at
once
some
penanced
lady
elf
some
demon
mistress
or
the
demon
self
upon
her
crest
she
wore
a
wannish
fire
sprinkled
with
stars
like
ariadne
tiar
her
head
was
serpent
but
ah
she
had
a
woman
mouth
with
all
its
pearls
complete
that
said
the
librarian
i
consider
the
gem
of
the
collection
it
is
truly
i
replied
but
i
think
it
a
profanation
to
have
poor
lamia
here
you
do
consider
began
gooch
yes
i
do
and
i
must
hurry
now
for
it
is
nearly
train
time
i
am
deeply
indebted
to
you
for
this
sight
of
your
animals
and
i
hope
your
opening
day
will
be
a
great
success
it
is
my
advice
to
you
not
to
let
any
nervous
persons
see
those
crabs
though
just
a
minute
we
have
a
rhinoceros
here
who
got
inside
his
skin
his
name
is
strorks
and
thank
you
very
much
but
i
really
must
hurry
and
i
went
out
and
left
him
beside
the
rhinoceros
their
just
reward
their
just
reward
i
looked
and
beheld
and
there
were
a
vast
number
of
girls
standing
in
rows
many
of
them
wore
pigtails
and
most
of
them
chewed
gum
who
are
they
i
asked
my
guide
and
he
said
they
are
the
girls
who
wrote
or
sweet
or
old
thing
on
the
of
library
books
some
of
them
used
to
put
comments
on
the
margins
of
the
pages
such
as
him
right
or
you
mean
old
cat
what
will
happen
to
them
i
inquired
they
are
to
stand
up
to
the
neck
in
a
lake
of
ice
cream
soda
for
ten
years
he
answered
that
will
not
be
much
of
a
punishment
to
them
i
suggested
but
he
told
me
that
i
had
never
tried
it
and
i
could
not
dispute
him
the
ones
over
there
he
remarked
pointing
to
a
detachment
of
the
girls
who
were
chewing
gum
more
vigorously
than
the
others
are
sentenced
for
fifteen
years
in
the
ice
cream
soda
lake
and
moreover
they
will
have
hot
molasses
candy
dropped
on
them
at
intervals
they
are
the
ones
who
wrote
if
my
name
you
wish
to
see
look
on
page
and
then
when
you
had
turned
to
page
cursing
yourself
for
a
fool
as
you
did
it
you
only
found
if
my
name
you
would
discover
look
upon
the
inside
cover
and
so
on
and
so
on
until
you
were
ready
to
drop
from
weariness
and
exasperation
hang
me
he
suddenly
exploded
if
i
had
the
say
of
it
i
bury
alive
in
cocoanut
taffy
i
told
the
boss
so
myself
i
agreed
with
him
that
they
were
getting
off
easy
a
lot
of
them
are
named
too
he
added
as
though
that
made
matters
worse
then
he
showed
me
a
great
crowd
of
older
people
they
were
mostly
men
though
there
were
one
or
two
women
here
and
there
these
are
the
annotators
he
said
the
people
who
work
off
their
idiotic
opinions
on
the
margins
and
of
books
they
dispute
the
author
statements
call
him
a
liar
and
abuse
him
generally
the
one
on
the
end
used
to
get
all
the
biographies
of
shakespeare
he
could
find
and
cover
every
bit
of
blank
paper
in
them
with
signed
baconian
he
usually
began
with
the
statement
author
of
this
book
is
a
fool
the
man
next
to
him
believed
that
the
earth
is
flat
and
he
aired
that
theory
so
extensively
with
a
that
he
ruined
about
two
hundred
dollars
worth
of
books
they
caught
him
and
put
him
in
jail
for
six
months
but
he
will
have
to
take
his
medicine
here
just
the
same
there
are
two
religious
cranks
standing
just
behind
him
at
least
they
were
cranks
about
religion
one
of
them
was
an
atheist
and
he
used
to
write
blasphemy
all
over
religious
books
the
other
suffered
from
too
much
religion
he
would
jot
down
texts
and
pious
mottoes
in
every
book
he
got
hold
of
he
would
cross
out
or
scratch
out
all
the
oaths
and
cuss
words
in
a
book
draw
a
pencil
line
through
any
reference
to
wine
or
strong
drink
and
call
especial
attention
to
any
passage
or
phrase
he
thought
improper
by
scrawling
over
it
he
is
tied
to
the
atheist
you
notice
the
woman
in
the
second
row
used
to
write
true
after
any
passage
or
sentence
that
pleased
her
she
gets
only
six
years
most
of
the
others
will
have
to
keep
it
up
for
eight
keep
what
up
i
asked
climbing
fences
was
the
answer
they
do
have
to
hurry
but
they
must
keep
moving
they
begin
at
seven
we
walked
down
the
hill
toward
a
group
of
infamous
looking
people
my
guide
stopped
and
pointed
toward
them
these
are
snippers
cutters
clippers
gougers
and
they
vary
all
the
way
from
men
who
cut
ads
out
of
the
newspapers
in
the
to
those
who
go
into
the
alcoves
and
lift
valuable
plates
by
the
method
you
see
they
come
from
all
classes
of
society
and
there
are
men
and
women
girls
and
boys
you
notice
they
are
all
a
little
and
they
keep
glancing
suspiciously
right
and
left
this
is
because
they
got
into
the
habit
of
sinking
down
in
their
chairs
to
get
behind
a
newspaper
and
watching
to
see
if
anyone
was
looking
there
is
one
man
who
was
interested
in
heraldry
he
extended
his
operations
over
five
or
six
libraries
public
and
private
when
they
found
him
out
and
visited
his
room
it
looked
like
the
college
of
heralds
he
had
a
couple
of
years
in
prison
but
here
he
is
now
just
the
same
the
man
next
to
him
is
well
no
need
to
mention
names
you
recognize
him
famous
millionaire
and
politician
never
went
into
a
library
but
once
in
his
life
then
he
went
to
see
an
article
in
a
london
newspaper
decided
he
wanted
to
keep
it
and
tore
out
half
the
page
library
attendant
saw
him
called
a
policeman
and
tried
to
have
him
arrested
you
see
the
attendant
did
know
who
he
was
did
anything
come
of
it
i
asked
yes
replied
the
guide
there
did
the
library
attendant
was
discharged
blank
simply
told
the
board
of
trustees
that
he
had
been
insulted
by
a
whippersnapper
who
did
look
as
if
he
had
ever
had
a
square
meal
in
his
life
one
or
two
of
the
board
wanted
to
investigate
but
the
majority
would
have
jumped
through
hoops
if
blank
had
told
them
to
he
is
in
this
section
for
five
years
but
he
has
over
eight
hundred
to
work
off
in
other
departments
the
men
on
the
end
of
the
line
five
or
six
dozen
of
them
used
to
cut
plates
out
of
the
art
magazines
a
common
habit
woman
standing
next
used
to
steal
sermons
man
next
but
one
to
her
was
a
minister
he
was
writing
a
book
on
the
holy
land
and
he
cut
maps
out
of
every
atlas
in
a
library
said
he
did
mean
to
keep
them
long
this
group
interested
me
and
i
wondered
what
was
to
be
done
with
them
you
will
see
in
a
minute
said
the
guide
they
are
going
to
begin
work
right
away
as
he
spoke
a
number
of
officials
came
down
the
hill
with
enormous
sheets
of
sticky
these
were
distributed
among
the
snippers
cutters
clippers
gougers
and
who
thereupon
set
to
work
with
penknives
cutting
small
bits
out
of
the
in
a
few
minutes
the
wretched
creatures
were
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
pieces
of
the
horrible
stuff
pulling
it
off
one
hand
to
have
it
stick
on
the
other
getting
it
in
their
hair
on
their
eyebrows
and
plastering
themselves
completely
that
is
not
very
painful
i
observed
no
said
my
companion
perhaps
not
gets
somewhat
monotonous
after
four
years
though
come
over
to
the
end
of
this
valley
i
want
you
to
see
a
dinner
party
that
is
taking
place
we
left
the
sticky
folks
behind
us
and
proceeded
through
the
valley
on
the
side
of
the
hill
i
noticed
a
small
body
of
people
mostly
men
the
guide
pointed
over
his
shoulder
at
them
remarking
reformed
spellers
they
were
busily
engaged
in
clipping
one
another
ears
off
with
large
scissors
there
was
a
sign
on
the
hill
beside
them
it
read
ears
are
unnecessary
why
not
get
rid
of
them
leave
enuf
to
hear
with
do
stop
til
you
are
thru
at
the
end
of
the
valley
there
was
a
large
level
space
something
like
a
picnic
was
going
on
people
were
eating
at
hundreds
of
little
tables
and
some
were
dancing
or
strolling
about
on
the
grass
the
guide
stopped
the
boss
is
prouder
of
this
than
of
anything
else
in
the
whole
place
he
said
the
people
who
are
giving
this
party
are
the
genealogists
nearly
all
women
you
notice
these
are
the
folks
who
have
driven
librarians
to
profanity
and
gray
hairs
some
of
them
wanted
ancestors
for
public
and
social
reasons
some
of
them
for
historical
or
financial
purposes
some
merely
to
gratify
personal
pride
or
private
curiosity
but
they
all
wanted
ancestors
for
one
reason
or
another
and
ancestors
they
have
for
years
they
charged
into
libraries
demanding
ancestors
over
there
you
see
that
big
crowd
they
are
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
lineal
descendants
of
william
brewster
next
to
them
are
six
thousand
rightful
lords
baltimore
that
vast
mob
beginning
at
the
big
tree
and
extending
for
six
miles
to
the
northeast
are
the
john
smith
and
pocahontas
crowd
some
descended
from
one
and
some
from
the
other
we
have
got
them
sorted
out
yet
how
many
of
them
are
there
i
demanded
according
to
our
best
estimates
he
replied
in
the
neighborhood
of
eight
million
at
present
but
of
course
we
are
receiving
fresh
additions
all
the
time
hundred
came
in
last
month
there
is
no
time
to
count
them
however
i
laughed
at
this
time
i
exclaimed
why
you
got
eternity
but
he
merely
waved
his
hand
and
went
on
they
are
the
largest
crowd
here
anyway
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
mayflower
descendants
they
have
a
whole
valley
to
themselves
beyond
the
second
hill
some
say
there
are
twelve
million
of
them
but
no
one
knows
recently
they
applied
for
another
valley
for
theirs
is
full
you
see
it
is
so
thickly
planted
with
family
trees
that
they
have
to
live
in
deep
shade
all
the
time
and
it
is
very
damp
and
chilly
then
there
are
upwards
of
three
hundred
thousand
tons
of
clocks
brass
cradles
chairs
and
tables
so
they
hardly
can
find
standing
room
we
walked
down
amongst
the
people
who
were
giving
the
picnic
i
wanted
to
see
what
was
the
object
of
this
lawn
party
for
it
struck
me
that
it
looked
more
like
the
elysian
fields
than
any
other
place
i
soon
discovered
my
mistake
near
the
first
group
of
tables
was
a
sign
with
the
inscription
grand
dames
of
the
pequot
war
and
at
one
of
the
tables
sat
cornelia
crumpet
i
remembered
the
hours
i
had
spent
hunting
up
two
ancestors
to
enable
crumpet
to
join
the
grand
dames
i
had
found
them
at
last
and
so
apparently
had
crumpet
for
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
pair
of
rascals
whom
she
was
entertaining
at
luncheon
were
the
ancestors
one
of
them
was
the
most
completely
soiled
individual
i
have
ever
seen
he
was
eating
something
or
other
and
he
did
not
waste
time
with
forks
or
any
other
implements
the
other
had
finished
his
meal
and
was
leaning
negligently
back
in
his
chair
he
was
smoking
a
large
pipe
and
he
had
his
feet
on
the
table
crumpet
wore
an
expression
that
showed
that
her
past
desire
to
discover
these
ancestors
was
as
a
passing
whim
compared
with
her
present
deep
overpowering
anxiety
to
be
rid
of
them
i
felt
sorry
for
the
poor
lady
but
she
was
not
alone
in
her
misery
all
about
her
were
grand
dames
of
the
pequot
war
engaged
in
entertaining
their
ancestors
some
of
the
ancestors
were
more
agreeable
some
far
more
distasteful
to
their
descendants
than
crumpet
pair
none
of
the
grand
dames
seemed
to
be
having
what
could
be
called
a
jolly
time
my
guide
at
last
led
me
through
the
maze
of
tables
and
out
into
the
open
we
have
a
good
many
japanese
visitors
in
this
section
said
he
they
come
to
get
some
points
from
the
americans
on
what
do
they
say
i
asked
him
they
just
giggle
and
go
away
he
replied
beyond
the
genealogists
we
found
a
large
group
of
people
who
the
guide
said
were
the
persons
who
borrow
books
and
never
return
them
the
complainants
in
their
case
were
mainly
private
individuals
rather
than
public
libraries
they
are
not
particularly
interesting
remarked
the
guide
but
their
punishment
will
appeal
to
you
as
we
passed
them
i
shuddered
to
see
that
they
were
all
engaged
in
filing
catalogue
cards
in
alphabetical
order
how
long
do
they
have
to
keep
that
up
was
my
question
and
i
was
horrified
to
learn
that
the
terms
varied
from
twenty
to
years
why
that
is
the
most
damnable
thing
i
ever
heard
i
said
the
sticky
folks
were
nothing
to
this
the
guide
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
the
rule
he
said
the
next
lot
of
people
we
came
on
were
curiously
engaged
long
lines
of
bookshelves
were
set
up
about
them
and
they
wandered
up
and
down
forever
taking
a
book
from
the
shelf
only
to
sigh
and
put
it
back
again
as
we
came
amongst
them
i
could
see
the
cause
of
their
weariness
the
shelves
seemed
to
be
lined
with
the
most
brilliant
looking
books
in
handsome
bindings
they
were
lettered
in
gold
complete
works
of
charles
dickens
works
of
dumas
edition
de
luxe
works
of
scott
and
so
on
yet
when
i
took
one
of
the
books
in
my
hand
to
look
at
it
it
was
no
book
at
all
but
just
a
wooden
dummy
painted
on
the
back
but
absolutely
blank
everywhere
else
they
were
like
the
things
used
by
furniture
dealers
to
put
in
a
bookcase
to
make
it
look
as
if
it
were
full
of
books
or
those
used
on
the
stage
when
a
library
setting
is
required
there
were
many
cords
of
wood
but
there
was
not
a
real
book
in
any
of
the
cases
i
asked
one
of
the
sufferers
why
he
was
doing
this
and
he
stopped
for
a
moment
his
patrol
and
turned
his
weary
eyes
upon
me
we
are
all
alike
he
said
indicating
his
associates
we
are
the
literary
bluffers
most
of
us
were
rich
i
was
myself
and
he
groaned
heavily
we
bought
books
by
the
yard
expensive
ones
always
editions
de
luxe
limited
editions
limited
to
ten
thousand
sets
and
each
set
numbered
of
which
this
is
no
he
added
in
a
dull
mechanical
fashion
as
though
he
were
repeating
a
lesson
we
were
easy
marks
for
all
the
dealers
and
agents
especially
illustrated
editions
with
extra
copies
of
the
engravings
in
a
portfolio
bindings
in
white
kid
or
any
other
tomfool
nonsense
was
what
we
were
always
looking
for
and
they
saw
that
we
got
them
whispered
information
that
this
set
of
paul
de
kock
or
balzac
was
complete
and
unexpurgated
and
that
if
we
would
buy
it
for
the
publishers
would
throw
in
an
extra
volume
privately
printed
and
given
away
to
purchasers
since
it
was
against
the
law
to
sell
it
this
was
the
sort
of
bait
we
always
bit
at
cheerily
and
now
here
we
are
and
he
began
again
his
tramp
up
and
down
taking
down
the
wooden
dummies
and
putting
them
back
again
with
dolorous
groans
i
could
not
stand
this
dismal
spectacle
very
long
so
we
hurried
on
to
a
crowd
of
men
bent
nearly
double
over
desks
they
were
pale
and
emaciated
which
my
guide
told
me
was
due
to
the
fact
that
they
had
nothing
to
eat
but
paper
they
are
bibliomaniacs
he
exclaimed
collectors
of
unopened
copies
seekers
after
misprints
measurers
by
the
millimetre
of
the
height
of
books
they
are
kept
busy
here
reading
the
seaside
novels
in
paper
covers
next
to
them
are
the
bibliographers
compilers
of
lists
and
counters
of
fly
leaves
they
cared
more
for
a
list
of
books
than
for
books
themselves
and
they
searched
out
unimportant
errors
in
books
and
rejoiced
mightily
when
they
found
one
exactitude
was
their
god
so
here
we
let
them
split
hairs
with
a
razor
and
dissect
the
legs
of
fleas
in
a
large
troop
of
school
children
a
few
hundred
yards
beyond
i
came
across
a
boy
about
fifteen
years
old
i
seemed
to
know
him
when
he
came
nearer
he
proved
to
have
two
books
tied
around
his
neck
the
sickly
covers
of
them
were
disgustingly
familiar
to
me
somebody
geometry
and
somebody
else
algebra
the
boy
was
blubbering
when
he
got
up
to
me
and
the
sight
of
him
with
those
noxious
books
around
his
neck
made
me
sob
aloud
i
was
still
crying
when
i
awoke
the
crowded
hour
the
crowded
hour
scene
the
circulating
department
of
the
public
library
time
four
of
a

me
sick

way

run
addressing
the
public
generally
what
right
have
these
library
people
paid
public
servants
public
employees

right

imposing

ever
borrowed
books
from
the
library
the
personage
never
in
my
life
suddenly
exploding
great
scott
i
never
saw
so
much
red
tape
in
my
life
miss
well
here
and
she
breaks
a
library
rule
herself
by
getting
the
name
and
address
of
the
personage
and
giving
him
the
book
charged
on
her
own
card
but
she
gets
rid
of
him
at
last
a
man
with
a
confidential
manner
leaning
over
the
desk
and
whispering
say
lady
i
want
to
get
a
book
miss
what
book
do
you
want
the
confidential
man
pursing
up
his
lips
and
nodding
his
head
as
if
to
tip
her
the
wink
why
er
why
same
yer
know
miss
looks
at
him
carefully
but
as
she
can
not
distinguish
him
amongst
the
forty
thousand
persons
who
have
entered
the
library
during
the
past
year
she
is
forced
to
make
further
inquiries
miss
which
same
one
i
do
remember
the
confidential
man
why
know
his
manner
indicates
that
it
is
a
delicate
personal
secret
between
miss
and
himself
that
one
i
had
last
summer
yer
know
miss
what
was
the
title
the
confidential
man
the
title
oh
the
of
it
he
regards
miss
with
the
tolerant
air
of
one
who
is
humoring
a
person
whose
curiosity
verges
on
the
impertinent
hoh
the
of
it
clean
forgot
having
thus
brushed
aside
her
trivial
question
he
regards
the
ceiling
and
awaits
the
arrival
of
the
book
miss
who
was
the
author
who
wrote
it
the
confidential
man
is
now
convinced
that
miss
for
some
playful
reason
of
her
own
is
merely
trying
to
keep
him
at
the
desk
that
she
has
the
book
within
reach
but
chooses
to
be
kittenish
about
it
he
smiles
pleasantly
at
her
the
confidential
man
lord
i
dunno
just
let
me
have
it
will
yer
he
is
still
quite
agreeable
as
if
he
were
saying
come
come
young
lady
i
know
it
very
nice
to
string
out
this
conversation
but
after
all
business
is
business
let
me
have
my
book
for
i
must
be
going
miss
i
afraid
i
ca
give
it
to
you
unless
you
can
tell
me
something
more
about
it
something
definite
we
have
over
four
hundred
thousand
books
in
this
library
you
know
and
if
you
do
recall
the
author
or
the
title
the
confidential
man
receives
the
news
about
the
four
hundred
thousand
books
with
the
air
of
a
person
listening
to
a
fairy
tale
the
idea
that
there
are
as
many
books
as
that
in
the
whole
world
to
say
nothing
of
one
library
strikes
him
as
it
would
if
miss
should
tell
him
that
she
is
the
rightful
queen
of
england
miss
ca
you
tell
me
about
the
book
what
it
was
about
i
mean
the
confidential
man
beginning
to
lose
his
patience
at
last
why
it
was
about
a
lot
of
things
miss
was
it
fiction
a
novel
the
confidential
man
huh
miss
was
it
a
story
or
a
book
of
travels
the
confidential
man
gazes
at
her
with
oystery
eyes
suddenly
he
becomes
more
animated
the
confidential
man
there
it
looked
just
like
that
he
points
across
the
desk
at
a
novel
bound
in
the
uniform
style
of
the
library
bindery
from
which
six
thousand
volumes
bound
precisely
alike
come
every
year
miss
is
that
it
she
hands
him
the
book
the
confidential
man
no
no
oh
no
nothin
like
it
he
puts
it
down
and
wanders
away
thinking
that
he
will
come
back
when
there
is
some
intelligent
attendant
at
the
desk
an
excited
person
look
here
i
been
reading
those
names
on
the
ceiling
and
longfellow
is
there
now
i
like
to
know
why
that
is
another
man
and
they
have
got
appeal
to
reason
in
the
reading
room
another
man
that
because
it
carnegie
library
ai
it
miss
miss
no
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
library
at
all
the
man
why
i
thought
he
run
it
do
he
miss
he
gave
the
money
for
the
building
that
is
all
he
has
never
been
in
it
nor
seen
it
so
far
as
i
know
the
man
that
all
right
i
guess
you
find
he
runs
it
just
the
same
the
first
man
i
guess
so
too
miss
it
must
keep
him
rather
busy
do
you
think
running
all
his
libraries
the
man
oh
he
can
have
people
in
his
pay
all
right
he
and
his
friend
gaze
about
to
see
if
they
can
detect
any
of
these
secret
agents

both
look
suspiciously
toward
miss
randlett
at
the
return
desk

very
large
woman

fernald
got
off
the
trolley
car
and
looked
about
for
graham
house
he
did
not
have
to
look
long
for
on
the
steps
of
a
brick
building
there
were
thirty
to
fifty
children
waiting
for
the
settlement
library
to
open
that
event
ought
to
happen
at
seven
and
the
illuminated
dial
on
the
fire
engine
house
across
the
street
now
indicated
five
minutes
of
seven
fernald
went
up
the
steps
through
the
crowd
and
turned
to
the
right
into
the
library
room
there
was
a
confusion
of
noises
two
or
three
nervous
giggles
and
snickers
a
loud
shuffling
of
feet
and
a
few
articulate
questions
where
the
teacher
ai
the
teacher
comin
mister
you
ai
got
the
lady
job
away
from
her
have
yer
and
then
apparently
in
derogation
of
the
last
inquiry
shut
up
you
fernald
took
off
his
coat
and
left
it
on
a
bench
then
he
unlocked
the
bookcases
which
were
instantly
surrounded
by
a
hungry
swarm
he
took
the
boxes
of
card
records
from
a
shelf
and
established
himself
with
rubber
stamp
pencil
and
pen
at
the
smaller
table
a
few
children
already
sat
about
the
larger
table
looking
at
the
worn
copies
of
puck
and
collier
a
girl
about
twelve
years
old
came
behind
the
table
and
whispered
confidentially
into
his
ear
ai
the
real
teacher
comin
mister
yes
explained
fernald
she
is
coming
in
about
half
an
hour
you
can
get
your
books
from
me
until
she
comes
oh
there
was
deep
christian
resignation
in
the
tone
and
fernald
felt
the
rebuke
at
the
main
library
he
was
superior
in
station
to
the
real
teacher
but
here
his
evident
inferiority
was
painful
but
he
had
no
time
to
dwell
on
it
for
there
were
at
least
seventeen
children
both
boys
and
girls
from
ten
to
sixteen
years
old
standing
about
him
on
three
sides
and
all
holding
one
or
two
books
toward
him
he
tried
to
remember
miss
grant
the
real
teacher
final
instructions
five
cents
a
week
on
all
books
which
have
been
kept
out
longer
than
two
weeks
do
give
back
any
cards
which
have
due
stamped
on
them
if
any
of
them
ask
for
new
cards
give
them
a
guarantor
slip
tell
them
to
fill
it
out
get
it
signed
by
some
grown
person
whose
name
is
in
the
directory
and
bring
it
back
next
week
look
out
for
minnie
leboskey
she
owes
fifteen
cents
and
will
try
to
get
her
card
back
do
lose
your
temper
with
them
they
all
behave
pretty
well
but
if
any
of
the
boys
throw
snowballs
in
at
the
top
of
the
window
get
flaherty
the
janitor
to
drive
them
away
he
looked
into
the
numerous
faces
wondering
if
the
nefarious
minnie
leboskey
were
there
in
the
meanwhile
he
was
mechanically
taking
in
the
books
stamping
the
cards
and
handing
them
back
he
noticed
that
his
fingers
grew
very
sticky
in
the
process
most
of
the
children
brought
another
book
to
the
desk
with
the
one
they
were
returning
this
was
one
they
had
already
selected
from
the
shelves
and
they
now
desired
to
exchange
it
for
the
books
they
handed
in
sometimes
their
preconcerted
schemes
were
confusing
to
the
substitute
librarian
as
when
for
instance
theresa
sullivan
returned
two
books
one
of
which
was
to
be
immediately
to
margaret
clancy
while
the
other
was
to
be
charged
on
the
card
of
nora
clancy
who
was
sick
with
ammonia
and
so
come
to
the
library
that
evening
but
the
book
which
margaret
returned
must
be
loaned
to
theresa
that
is
one
of
them
must
be
while
the
other
was
to
be
given
into
the
keeping
of
mary
finnegan
who
in
her
turn
brought
back
three
books
two
on
her
own
cards
and
one
on
her
mother
and
her
mother
wanted
the
book
that
eustacia
had
returned
there
it
is
right
on
the
desk
in
front
of
you
eustacia
over
there
at
the
and
please
mary
finnegan
herself

this
book
that
mary
divver

on
her
white
card
and

her
blue
card
she
wants
the
one

elbow
jabs
in
the
ribs
will
have
any
effect
from
agnes
casey
and
that
ai
nothin
on
the
cover
except
a
teeny
little
piece
of
tolu
gum
and
nellie
sullivan
wants

you
please

something
out
for
her
mister

times
to

and

me
this
book
that
lizzie
brady
has
just
brought

on
my
white
card
and
this
is
my
blue
card
and
my
father
says
that
this
book
on
electric
ai
no
good
and
he
wants
another
after
twenty
uninterrupted
minutes
of
this
sort
of
thing
fernald
who
had
once
pitched
for
his
class
nine
and
stood
calm
while
the
sophomores
exploded
bunches
of
cannon
crackers
around
him
and
sprayed
him
with
a
garden
hose
felt
inclined
to
jump
up
and
roar
for
god
sake
hold
your
tongues
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
however
for
at
that
moment
a
scuffle
broke
out
at
the
bookcase
between
two
boys
he
left
his
table
long
enough
to
separate
the
boys
and
tell
them
to
stop
fighting
or
he
would
put
them
out
he
could
help
remembering
miss
grant
and
her
associate
miss
french
who
after
eight
hours
in
the
main
library
during
the
day
came
over
here
each
thursday
evening
for
the
mere
love
of
it
the
chief
librarian
had
visited
the
place
once
a
year
ago
coming
at
eight
when
all
was
orderly
and
quiet
he
looked
blandly
around
for
a
few
moments
and
then
went
away
a
few
weeks
later
he
included
in
his
annual
report
a
perfunctory
sentence
about
the
faithful
service
of
the
two
young
women
miss
grant
came
at
about
seven
and
fernald
turned
the
desk
over
to
her
i
wish
you
would
get
that
girl
a
book
he
remarked
she
has
been
after
me
ever
since
i
arrived
for
a
book
have
you
anything
sufficiently
mournful
miss
grant
thought
she
could
supply
the
need
but
fernald
did
not
learn
what
the
book
was
for
as
she
came
back
from
the
shelves
she
remarked
i
am
afraid
that
boy
needs
watching
he
comes
here
only
for
mischief
never
takes
any
books
she
indicated
a
tall
lank
youth
of
unpleasant
countenance
and
about
fifteen
years
old
he
was
sitting
at
the
center
table
moving
the
magazines
about
and
watching
the
librarians
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
have
you
had
trouble
with
him
before
asked
fernald
oh
yes
said
miss
grant
he
tripped
me
up
last
thursday
night
tripped
you
up
yes
stuck
out
his
foot
as
i
went
by
the
table
with
an
armful
of
books
i
fell
and
spilled
the
books
all
over
the
floor
why
the
young
pup
shall
i
put
him
out
no
he
has
done
anything
at
this
moment
the
boy
seized
a
magazine
and
rapidly
slapped
three
smaller
boys
over
the
head
with
it
one
of
the
little
boys
began
to
cry
and
fernald
remarking
i
guess
that
will
do
wo
it
conducted
the
perpetrator
of
the
offence
to
the
outer
door
as
soon
as
he
felt
the
grip
on
his
collar
relax
the
boy
ran
to
the
middle
of
the
street
and
armed
himself
not
with
the
gentle
snowball
but
with
four
or
five
of
the
hard
lumps
of
ice
which
mingled
with
dirt
and
gravel
covered
the
street
come
out
from
in
front
of
that
glass
door
the
boy
shouted
and
let
me
have
a
shot
at
yer
aw
yer
do
dare
to
yer
scared
to
and
fernald
not
being
a
true
sportsman
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
was
scared
to
he
gazed
at
the
boy
a
moment
or
two
and
then
went
slowly
inside
the
boy
set
up
a
derisive
yell
showing
that
the
victory
remained
with
the
child
of
darkness
as
it
frequently
does
his
experience
of
one
evening
in
the
settlement
library
made
fernald
anxious
to
see
more
of
the
work
he
returned
on
the
following
thursday
but
a
little
later
than
the
time
of
his
first
visit
it
was
seven
and
the
settlement
was
in
full
swing
loud
whoops
and
yells
combined
with
noise
as
of
a
herd
of
buffaloes
indicated
that
a
basketball
game
was
in
progress
in
the
basement
gymnasium
the
rumble
and
crash
of
a
bowling
alley
were
partly
drowned
by
the
cries
from
a
back
room
where
various
minor
games
were
being
enjoyed
the
two
library
assistants
miss
grant
and
miss
french
were
dispensing
books
in
the
room
near
the
entrance
fernald
had
just
taken
his
coat
off
when
flaherty
the
janitor
beckoned
him
to
the
door
of
the
library
by
the
nonchalant
method
of
standing
in
the
door
and
throwing
his
chin
in
the
air
with
a
series
of
short
jerks
when
fernald
went
across
the
room
to
find
what
was
wanted
flaherty
drew
him
mysteriously
into
the
passage
say
i
guess
yer
got
into
some
trouble
here
last
week
did
yer
trouble
no
i
do
remember
any
trouble
did
yer
put
a
feller
out
or
somethin
oh

a
boy

the
old
man
here
though
been
waitin
for
an
hour
says
he
going
to
have
the
law
on
yer
fernald
became
interested
where
is
he
he
inquired

in
here
been
settin
by
the
stove
and
now
he
gone
to
sleep
i
send
him
out
to

but
do

worry
about
no
law
godfrey
i
had
forty
of
goin
to
have
the
law
on
me
i
not
worried
fernald
assured
him
and
the
other
departed
in
search
of
the
wrathful
parent
this
person
soon
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
short
stout
man
with
a
straggly
yellow
moustache
and
a
very
red
face
he
had
enormously
long
arms
so
that
his
hat
which
he
carried
in
one
hand
hung
nearly
on
a
level
with
his
ankles
he
was
blinking
at
the
lights
and
was
plainly
more
than
half
asleep
also
it
was
evident
that
the
wrath
had
gone
out
of
him
he
looked
inquiringly
at
fernald
as
though
the
librarian
not
he
were
seeking
the
interview
he
continued
to
blink
until
at
last
fernald
had
to
begin
the
conversation
you
wanted
to
see
me
something
about
your
son
oh
yes
say
he
come
home
an
he
says
you
put
him
outer
here
yes
i
did
replied
fernald
that
was
a
week
ago
and
if
i
had
been
here
two
weeks
ago
and
had
had
a
i
would
have
given
him
a
good
licking
he
needs
one
the
man
looked
greatly
astonished
but
said
nothing
so
the
librarian
continued
i
put
him
out
last
week
for
banging
three
little
boys
over
the
heads
with
a
magazine
i
had
been
watching
him
for
ten
minutes
he
come
in
here
to
play
in
the
gymnasium
which
is
what
he
needs
nor
to
read
he
comes
into
the
library
every
week
just
to
raise
the
devil
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
touched
a
book
when
he
picked
up
one
to
lambaste
these
boys
with
it
and
two
weeks
ago
he
stuck
his
foot
out
when
one
of
the
women
who
had
charge
of
the
library
was
passing
the
table
and
she
tripped
and
fell
flat
with
an
armful
of
books
if
he
wants
to
come
back
and
behave
he
may
but
he
ca
come
otherwise
he
says
you
choked
him
remarked
the
man
he
lies
said
fernald
i
took
him
by
the
collar
and
put
him
out
that
all
he
was
quite
able
as
soon
as
i
let
him
go
to
run
into
the
street
and
pick
up
half
a
dozen
lumps
of
ice
and
swear
at
me
and
dare
me
to
come
out
from
in
front
of
the
glass
door
so
he
could
have
the
pleasure
of
breaking
my
face
without
any
risk
of
breaking
the
glass
oh
well
the
man
returned
it
all
right
then
as
soon
as
i
see
you
i
knew
it
was
all
right
fernald
was
somewhat
mystified
at
the
impression
he
had
made
he
was
not
especially
tremendous
physically
and
although
he
came
clad
in
the
armor
of
righteousness
on
this
particular
occasion
he
had
no
delusions
about
the
effect
that
kind
of
armor
is
likely
to
have
on
a
man
of
this
sort
but
the
father
of
the
boy
went
on
to
explain
say
yer
know
i
did
know
but
it
was
some
of
these
here
kids
that
had
been
pickin
on
him
i
would
stand
for
that
yer
know
but
soon
i
see
you
i
knew
it
was
all
right
say
he
ai
got
no
business
here
anyhow
i
told
him
so
i
do
want
him
to
come
it
ai
a
fit
place
and
the
man
departed
wishing
the
librarian
fernald
was
thoroughly
resigned
to
the
idea
of
the
boy
not
coming
any
more
but
he
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
idea
that
it
was
a
fit
place
graham
house
the
pet
charity
of
a
large
and
prosperous
church
had
been
described
in
the
words
that
its
officers
might
have
used
of
some
particularly
obnoxious
saloon
or
gambling
joint
he
imagined
how
the
rev
alexander
lambeth
who
came
over
once
or
twice
a
week
to
smile
around
the
place
clerically
how
he
would
look
at
hearing
one
of
the
residents
of
the
neighborhood
describe
it
as
not
a
fit
place
for
his
son
to
visit
in
the
evening
fernald
went
back
into
the
library
room
it
was
crowded
with
children
and
the
two
librarians
had
their
hands
full
one
of
them
was
charging
books
at
the
desk
the
other
was
making
desperate
endeavors
to
get
the
books
in
the
cases
in
some
sort
of
order
to
find
certain
volumes
which
some
of
the
children
wished
to
keep
the
children
fairly
quiet
and
in
general
to
regulate
the
discipline
of
the
place
there
were
no
particularly
youngsters
one
or
two
who
were
pretending
to
look
at
the
picture
papers
at
the
table
in
reality
were
merely
waiting
for
a
chance
to
get
into
a
scuffle
or
in
some
other
way
to
put
the
liberry
on
the
bum
the
children
room
at
the
central
library
was
a
quieter
place
it
was
in
a
much
quieter
part
of
the
town
the
impressive
architecture
impressive
to
children
at
least
spacious
rooms
and
other
accessories
produced
a
more
typical
library
atmosphere
here
the
fact
that
their
feet
were
on
their
native
heath
the
familiar
noises
of
wagons
and
clanging
trolley
cars
outside
and
the
hubbub
of
the
gymnasium
below
all
conspired
to
make
the
children
a
little
more
restless
fernald
listened
to
miss
grant
who
sat
at
the
desk
with
fifteen
girls
and
boys
and
one
or
two
older
persons
around
her
the
older
ones
were
parents
or
friends
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
and
frequented
the
library
miss
grant
was
discharging
the
books
as
they
were
returned
charging
new
ones
and
incidentally
acting
as
literary
adviser
and
bureau
of
information

the

in

observes
that
another
small

experimenting
with
a
penful
of
red
ink
while
miss
grant
back
is
turned
to
see
how
far

the
young

decides

she
departs
hastily
assuring
the
librarian
that

minutes
miss
two
women
oh
what
he
putting
out
the
lights
for
i
have
found
a
book
yet
mulch
mulch
toward
spring
the
books
on
gardening
begin
to
come
into
the
library
and
i
look
them
over
with
fresh
enthusiasm
bunkum
is
no
longer
my
favorite
author
in
this
field
but
her
sister
writers
are
very
dear
to
my
heart
there
is
reginald
creasus
i
seize
her
latest
volume
with
the
eagerness
of
a
child
i
like
to
see
the
pictures
of
the
new
marble
bench
which
she
has
imported
from
pompeii
and
set
up
at
the
end
of
the
rose
walk
then
she
usually
has
a
new
sculptured
group
a
fountain
or
some
other
little
trifle
by
rodin
or
gaudens
which
looks
so
well
amidst
the
japanese
iris
after
gazing
at
these
illustrations
for
a
while
i
go
home
and
observe
the
red
woodshed
and
i
declare
it
looks
altogether
different
it
is
wonderful
how
discontented
with
your
lot
you
can
get
by
reading
creasus
books
on
gardening
sometimes
i
think
that
i
am
making
a
mistake
in
voting
the
republican
ticket
year
after
year
debs
may
be
right
after
all
this
year
creasus
calls
her
volume
the
simple
garden
from
it
i
gathered
that
anyone
who
knows
anything
at
all
will
not
pass
the
summer
without
an
abyssinian
hibiscus
unfolding
its
lovely
blooms
somewhere
on
the
place
they
are
absolutely
necessary
in
fact
you
have
to
be
careful
with
them
when
you
plant
them
that
is
the
fertilizer
which
they
require
has
to
be
fetched
from
the
island
of
ascension
i
calculated
that
by
going
without
food
or
clothes
for
two
years
i
could
just
about
buy
and
support
one
of
them
i
wish
creasus
would
write
a
book
about
the
complicated
garden
i
should
like
to
see
it
just
as
i
had
bought
a
garden
hose
along
came
creasus
book
remarking
casually
that
it
is
well
to
have
the
whole
garden
laid
out
with
underground
placed
at
least
six
feet
below
the
surface
to
avoid
frost
two
or
three
private
reservoirs
are
of
course
an
essential
i
wonder
what
creasus
keeps
in
these
reservoirs
i
suppose
it
is
champagne
but
i
would
like
to
ask
scotch
gardeners
are
going
out
she
says
the
chinese
are
the
only
kind
although
they
demand
and
get
forty
to
fifty
dollars
more
per
month
than
the
others
i
made
a
note
to
employ
no
more
scotchmen
and
then
i
looked
to
see
what
she
had
to
say
about
she
was
ever
so
enthusiastic
about
them
no
family
should
be
without
she
said
you
dig
a
trench
and
you
put
in
four
or
five
different
kinds
of
dressing
separated
by
layers
of
earth
and
then
you
plant
the
peas
and
as
fast
as
they
come
up
you
keep
discouraging
them
by
putting
more
earth
and
things
on
top
and
then
you
build
a
trellis
for
them
to
run
on
sinking
the
posts
not
less
than
four
feet
and
there
you
are
only
you
must
mulch
them
mulch
that
struck
me
as
a
pleasant
word
it
had
a
nice
squshy
sound
about
it
i
thought
it
would
be
so
nice
on
hot
evenings
to
go
around
mulching
and
mulching
i
went
to
the
dictionary
to
look
it
up
and
find
out
what
it
meant
but
just
at
that
minute
general
bumpus
came
into
my
office
he
was
interested
to
see
creasus
book
lying
open
on
my
desk
he
is
president
of
the
library
board
and
he
is
another
gardening
enthusiast
going
to
have
some
he
asked
observing
the
picture
yes
i
replied
i
thought
i
would
well
he
said
that
all
right
only
you
must
mulch
them
good
and
plenty
is
that
necessary
i
inquired
looking
him
straight
in
the
eye
oh
yes
absolutely
before
we
could
say
anything
more
about
it
someone
came
in
to
tell
the
general
that
bumpus
said
the
horses
were
uneasy
and
that
she
wished
he
would
come
out
he
went
away
and
then
miss
davis
came
to
get
me
there
was
a
man
in
the
who
wanted
me
to
give
him
permission
to
break
some
rule
or
other
so
i
forgot
all
about
the
until
i
was
on
my
way
home
then
i
stepped
in
at
the
seed
shop
to
get
the
peas
philip
morris
was
there
buying
a
he
had
paid
for
it
and
was
starting
toward
the
door
when
he
saw
me
hullo
buying
yes
have
you
ever
raised
any
tried
to
one
year
they
did
come
up
at
all
and
another
year
the
got
and
another
they
just
sort
of
sickened
and
died
but
i
did
mulch
that
was
the
trouble
well
why
you
mulch
why
i
would
have
but
george
that
my
car
and
he
rushed
out
i
did
not
like
to
display
my
ignorance
before
the
dealer
so
i
merely
took
the
peas
and
started
up
the
street
with
them
inside
of
two
minutes
i
met
miss
abernathy
she
has
a
marvelous
i
stopped
her
and
told
her
of
my
purchase
oh
you
going
to
have
i
envy
you
i
never
been
very
successful
with
them
what
happened
to
them
i
do
know
they
seemed
to
get
disappointed
they
need
very
rich
soil
maybe
i
suggested
tentatively
you
did
mulch
oh
that
does
make
any
difference
does
it
not
a
bit
and
she
bade
me
good
evening
and
passed
on
when
i
reached
home
and
had
eaten
dinner
i
told
jane
that
i
was
going
to
plant
some
i
described
the
process
to
her
she
was
very
much
interested
and
offered
to
help
i
dug
the
trench
and
put
in
the
peas
i
thought
some
bushes
might
do
instead
of
creasus
trellis
now
i
said
all
they
need
is
to
be
mulched
to
be
what
asked
jane
mulched
you
always
have
to
mulch
that
is
creasus
and
general
bumpus
and
philip
morris
say
so
but
miss
abernathy
thinks
not
how
do
you
do
it
jane
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
not
know
how
to
mulch
of
course
i
do
how
do
you
do
it
i
felt
in
my
pocket
ca
you
roll
me
a
cigarette
there
some
paper
and
tobacco
in
the
house
on
my
desk
jane
went
dutifully
away
and
when
she
returned
i
lighted
the
cigarette
there
i
said
they
all
mulched
i
did
it
with
this
hoe
is
what
it
means
all
this
happened
in
april
and
now
it
is
august
and
the
still
maintain
a
somewhat
sullen
appearance
i
wonder
if
miss
abernathy
was
right
after
all
perhaps
i
did
wrong
to
mulch
them
at
least
so
savagely
a
bookman

a
bookman
armory
anthony
gooch
brother
of
the
librarian
of
east
caraway
owns
one
of
the
choicest
private
libraries
it
has
ever
been
my
good
luck
to
see
i
spent
an
evening
with
him
recently
and
inspected
his
books
anthony
gooch
was
highly
amused
at
the
account
of
his
brother
literary
zoölogical
annex
which
i
wrote
for
the
boston
transcript
percival
has
tacked
that
barn
on
his
library
he
said
and
filled
it
with
all
those
absurd
animals
not
of
which
are
genuine
poor
percy
the
dealers
have
pulled
his
leg
unmercifully
and
he
spends
all
his
evenings
and
holidays
shoveling
hay
to
those
preposterous
elephants
and
wandering
around
in
that
menagerie
i
afraid
the
old
fellow
is
getting
dotty
why
what
do
you
think
he
told
me
last
week
i
had
not
the
least
idea
and
i
said
so
why
he
is
negotiating
with
a
london
dealer
for
the
oysters
mentioned
in
walrus
and
the
carpenter
you
remember
them
of
course
and
gooch
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
waving
the
stem
of
his
long
pipe
in
time
with
the
beat
of
lewis
carroll
exquisite
verses
repeated
four
young
oysters
hurried
up
all
eager
for
the
treat
their
coats
were
brushed
their
faces
washed
their
shoes
were
clean
and
neat
and
this
was
odd
because
you
know
they
had
any
feet
other
oysters
followed
them
and
yet
another
four
i
told
him
that
he
was
being
cheated
for
the
poem
distinctly
states
see
stanza
lines
and
that
the
walrus
and
the
carpenter
ate
all
the
oysters
but
he
replied
that
perhaps
these
were
some
of
the
elder
oysters
for
in
the
poem
it
says
eldest
oyster
looked
at
him
but
never
a
word
he
said
the
eldest
oyster
winked
his
eye
and
shook
his
heavy
head
meaning
to
say
he
did
not
choose
to
leave
the
it
is
useless
to
argue
with
him
continued
anthony
gooch
and
if
his
trustees
will
let
him
spend
the
money
i
suppose
i
ought
not
mind
still
i
do
hate
to
think
of
the
name
of
gooch
being
connected
with
a
fraudulent
collection
i
agreed
that
it
was
distressing
and
remarked
that
i
thought
it
curious
that
one
brother
should
be
a
collector
and
the
other
have
no
interest
in
that
kind
of
hobby
for
anthony
gooch
library
is
remarkably
free
from
all
items
that
appeal
merely
to
the
bibliomaniac
his
books
are
beautiful
but
they
are
to
be
read
and
gooch
has
read
them
he
owns
no
unopened
copies
nor
any
such
nonsense
my
host
smiled
well
of
course
i
do
not
go
in
for
fakes
and
i
certainly
do
not
care
to
act
as
keeper
to
a
lot
of
crocodiles
and
flounders
and
jackdaws
and
other
livestock
as
percival
does
still
my
little
museum
you
have
never
seen
it
come
this
way
gooch
led
me
to
a
door
at
the
right
of
the
fireplace
between
two
bookcases
he
opened
the
door
turned
on
the
lights
and
we
entered
a
small
room
i
exclaimed
with
astonishment
for
we
stood
in
an
arsenal
or
rather
an
armory
the
walls
were
lined
with
weapons
stands
of
arms
were
in
the
corners
and
a
number
of
flags
and
banners
hung
from
the
ceiling
the
weapons
were
of
every
variety
and
period
old
spears
and
battleaxes
stone
hatchets
bows
and
sheaves
of
arrows
these
were
mingled
with
modern
rifles
automatic
pistols
and
bowie
knives
daggers
of
a
dozen
patterns
hung
on
the
walls
or
lay
on
the
tables
one
or
two
ancient
pieces
of
artillery
culverins
and
drakes
i
fancy
were
in
a
corner
together
with
a
gun
from
some
modern
these
said
gooch
looking
me
in
the
eye
very
seriously
are
absolutely
genuine
every
one
of
them
and
not
one
but
has
figured
in
some
scene
in
literature
i
have
spent
fifteen
years
in
assembling
this
collection
and
well
i
prize
it
highly
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
disgusts
me
to
have
my
brother
percival
waste
his
time
over
that
ridiculous
aggregation
of
animals
so
many
of
which
are
sheer
frauds
it
tends
to
bring
my
collection
of
weapons
under
suspicion
and
i
do
not
need
to
say
that
i
can
not
bear
to
have
anyone
doubt
the
absolute
authenticity
of
my
treasures
if
you
feel
any
doubt
about
them
i
wish
you
would
say
so
now
and
we
will
go
back
to
the
library
but
i
told
gooch
that
suspicion
was
a
trait
foreign
to
my
nature
long
ago
i
said
i
took
the
advice
of
the
white
queen
in
the
and
practised
believing
impossible
things
for
half
an
hour
every
day
like
her
sometimes
i
believed
as
many
as
six
impossible
things
before
breakfast
then
i
have
no
hesitation
in
showing
you
my
collection
remarked
gooch
look
at
this
sword
it
is
the
envenomed
rapier
of
laertes
dipped
in
an
unction
which
he
bought
of
a
mountebank
be
careful
not
to
touch
the
point
i
think
some
of
the
poison
lingers
on
it
now
and
it
has
already
been
responsible
for
two
no
three
deaths
you
remember
that
hamlet
used
it
to
kill
the
king
after
it
had
wounded
both
him
and
laertes
in
the
fencing
bout
i
put
down
the
rapier
gingerly
and
inquired
about
a
pistol
which
lay
on
the
table
near
at
hand
gooch
told
me
that
it
was
the
weapon
owned
by
madame
defarge
through
which
she
came
to
her
death
and
what
was
probably
worse
from
her
point
of
view
added
the
collector
she
was
thus
unavoidably
detained
from
her
front
seat
at
the
guillotine
on
that
day
of
days
when
she
hoped
to
see
the
marquis
of
evremond
lose
his
life
someone
has
said
that
the
whole
french
revolution
seemed
to
have
been
brought
about
so
madame
defarge
might
have
her
revenge
so
of
course
the
blow
was
a
severe
one
to
her
this
pistol
exploded
while
she
was
struggling
with
miss
pross
in
the
empty
house
and
the
explosion
killed
her
and
deafened
miss
pross
even
then
the
tumbril
was
carrying
sydney
carton
to
the
guillotine
your
relics
are
rather
gruesome
i
observed
i
pride
myself
that
there
are
more
horrors
comprised
in
this
small
room
than
in
most
of
its
size
said
gooch
but
they
are
not
all
connected
with
tragedies
here
for
instance
is
the
mace
which
the
white
knight
used
in
his
battle
with
the
red
knight
and
i
have
also
up
there
on
the
wall
his
sword
made
of
a
lath
you
see
still
weapons
are
naturally
instruments
of
crime
or
at
any
rate
of
violence
and
some
very
notorious
murders
are
commemorated
here
he
picked
up
a
long
knife
with
this
he
said
markheim
killed
the
shopkeeper
one
of
the
very
finest
murders
in
literature
in
my
opinion
you
recall
the
circumstances
christmas
day
the
two
men
alone
in
the
shop
i
do
indeed
i
replied
willing
to
show
my
familiarity
with
stevenson
wonderful
tale
and
i
remember
the
terrible
moments
that
followed
the
murderer
alone
with
the
dead
man
the
silence
the
ticking
of
the
clocks
the
man
who
knocked
on
the
outside
door
and
all
the
rest
of
it
gooch
replaced
the
knife
and
drew
my
attention
to
a
shield
and
a
long
spear
which
hung
on
the
wall
these
he
said
belonged
to
a
they
were
a
shield
an
the
implements
for
a
day
with
fuzzy
on
the
rush
near
them
hung
an
old
musket
it
was
a
perfect
wreck
the
stock
and
the
lock
and
barrel
covered
with
rust
it
was
never
used
to
kill
anything
more
dangerous
than
a
squirrel
or
a
wild
goose
said
my
host
yet
its
original
owner
was
nearly
arrested
for
carrying
it
on
one
occasion
surely
you
can
guess
who
that
owner
was
i
guessed
rip
van
winkle
and
gooch
said
that
was
correct
it
does
improve
a
musket
or
a
man
to
lie
out
on
the
mountains
day
and
night
for
twenty
years
he
added
then
he
showed
me
othello
sword
of
spain
of
the
temper
with
which
the
moor
smote
himself
as
once
in
aleppo
he
smote
a
malignant
and
a
turban
turk
this
box
said
gooch
contains
one
of
my
greatest
prizes
nothing
less
than
the
dagger
which
led
macbeth
to
sleeping
chamber
but
it
was
an
dagger
it
was
imaginary
i
began
and
then
the
old
story
about
the
man
and
his
mongoose
recurred
to
me
and
i
stopped
i
looked
in
the
box
and
of
course
found
it
empty
the
collector
of
weapons
laughed
and
seemed
greatly
delighted
with
his
little
joke
i
judged
that
he
was
accustomed
to
play
it
on
every
visitor
what
is
this
bottle
it
seems
out
of
place
here
not
at
all
replied
gooch
it
is
falstaff
pocket
pistol
this
cane
once
belonged
to
wackford
squeers
but
it
was
used
on
only
one
occasion
and
then
against
the
owner
himself
by
nicholas
nickleby
he
then
showed
me
a
sword
broken
near
the
hilt
it
was
henry
esmond
he
broke
it
when
he
denied
the
prince
and
heaped
reproaches
upon
him
for
going
dangling
after
beatrix
when
the
opportunity
of
his
life
was
at
hand
little
the
prince
cared
he
deigned
a
few
moments
later
to
cross
swords
with
esmond
and
frank
used
this
broken
blade
to
strike
up
their
weapons
it
was
such
a
condescension
esmond
knew
the
prince
to
be
worthless
and
he
had
just
been
insulting
him
in
every
way
he
could
think
but
he
was
of
the
sacred
blood
of
the
stuarts
enough
for
any
jacobite
you
will
find
a
full
account
of
it
in
the
novel
if
you
care
to
refresh
your
memory
this
is
a
knife
a
curious
weapon
is
it
carmen
used
it
to
slash
the
face
of
the
woman
she
quarreled
with
she
cut
a
neat
andrew
cross
on
her
enemy
cheek
that
led
to
her
subsequent
arrest
by
don
josé
the
escape
at
which
he
connived
and
all
the
train
of
events
which
followed
this
is
the
knife
that
don
josé
killed
carmen
with
how
did
you
get
all
these
weapons
i
asked
him
oh
in
various
ways
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
patience
some
money
and
some
imagination
i
traveled
for
three
or
four
years
but
since
then
i
have
had
to
employ
agents
some
authors
would
almost
fill
this
room
by
themselves
if
i
cared
to
collect
all
the
weapons
for
which
they
are
responsible
see
all
those
spears
and
broadswords
that
is
my
sir
thomas
malory
corner
walter
scott
covered
almost
that
entire
wall
spears
claymores
daggers
battleaxes
and
pistols
i
could
not
get
the
sword
of
saladin
that
like
some
other
valuable
pieces
is
owned
by
a
virtuoso
of
whom
you
may
have
heard
this
sword
was
used
by
rudolf
rassendyll
he
employed
it
in
freeing
the
prisoner
of
zenda
a
revolver
would
have
been
quicker
probably
but
not
half
so
picturesque
i
was
glad
to
get
that
sword
but
i
soon
had
to
stop
buying
the
mass
of
cutlery
that
came
into
the
market
shortly
after
it
was
forged
i
could
have
filled
my
house
with
it
poor
weapons
they
were
mostly
see
those
rapiers
over
the
fireplace
they
are
of
the
finest
temper
and
came
from
alexandre
dumas
the
one
on
the
left
of
somewhat
the
same
shape
was
used
by
a
gentleman
of
france
that
spear
was
carried
by
the
squire
of
sir
nigel
loring
when
he
rode
into
spain
at
the
head
of
the
white
company
there
is
the
good
broadsword
of
young
lochinvar
and
this
is
the
sword
with
which
horatius
held
the
bridge
in
the
brave
days
of
old
the
one
with
which
he
killed
the
lord
of
luna
precisely
how
does
it
go
teeth
and
skull
and
helmet
so
fierce
a
thrust
he
sped
the
good
sword
stood
a
handbreadth
out
behind
the
tuscan
head
no
one
does
anything
like
that
now
those
were
the
days
they
were
certainly
the
two
swords
next
to
horatius
who
owned
them
lord
barnard
and
little
musgrave
you
know
the
old
ballad
and
gooch
quoted
again
first
stroke
little
musgrave
struck
he
hurt
lord
barnard
sore
the
next
stroke
that
lord
barnard
struck
little
musgrave
never
struck
more
then
the
collector
showed
me
a
rifle
of
modern
pattern
the
regular
rifle
of
the
british
army
twenty
years
ago
this
belonged
to
private
stanley
ortheris
he
took
it
with
him
that
day
he
went
out
to
look
for
a
native
deserter
who
was
making
things
unpleasant
by
night
for
the
old
regiment
ortheris
had
his
two
companions
with
him
and
while
they
waited
learoyd
told
the
story
greenhow
hill
at
its
end
the
deserter
appeared
and
ortheris
ended
his
career
at
long
range
there
was
a
lass
tewed
up
wi
him
too
opined
learoyd
i
nodded
for
i
liked
the
story
well
here
is
the
pistol
said
gooch
that
was
found
by
the
side
of
john
oakhurst
gambler
who
struck
a
streak
of
bad
luck
on
the
of
november
and
handed
in
his
checks
on
the
of
december
then
i
asked
about
a
hammer
that
lay
among
other
objects
on
the
table
it
is
not
a
weapon
exactly
admitted
gooch
but
it
belonged
to
adam
bede
he
used
it
in
making
a
coffin
the
night
his
father
was
drowned
the
musket
is
the
one
with
which
carver
doone
shot
lorna
in
the
church
that
peculiar
machine
in
the
corner
it
does
look
earthly
does
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
a
heat
ray
apparatus
which
was
employed
by
the
martians
in
the
war
of
the
worlds
we
moved
around
the
room
slowly
gooch
sometimes
pointing
to
weapons
which
hung
high
above
our
heads
and
sometimes
taking
them
down
so
i
could
examine
them
closely
in
this
more
satisfactory
fashion
he
now
showed
me
a
remarkable
axe
the
haft
was
of
rhinoceros
horn
wound
with
copper
wire
this
handle
was
over
a
yard
long
the
head
was
of
steel
as
i
had
suspected
the
axe
had
belonged
to
umslopogaas
the
zulu
warrior
with
this
axe
he
had
terrorized
the
french
cook
alphonse
and
with
it
he
fought
his
great
fight
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
it
had
numerous
nicks
in
the
horn
handle
each
nick
representing
a
man
killed
with
it
in
battle
here
is
another
knife
which
figured
in
a
murder
said
gooch
tess
killed
alec
with
it
and
this
is
the
unsheathed
sword
that
lay
between
tristram
and
iseult
on
a
shelf
in
a
corner
was
a
piece
of
some
red
stone
i
inquired
about
it
remarking
that
it
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
the
collection
no
it
does
not
gooch
agreed
but
it
served
very
effectively
on
a
certain
occasion
that
was
the
meeting
of
the
scientific
society
on
the
stanislow
if
i
can
quote
correctly
the
incident
is
described
as
follows
peleg
jones
of
angels
raised
a
point
of
order
when
a
chunk
of
old
red
sandstone
took
him
in
the
abdomen
and
he
smiled
a
kind
of
sickly
smile
and
curled
up
on
the
floor
and
the
subsequent
proceedings
interested
him
no
more
i
remember
now
said
i
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
serious
battle
yes
events
followed
fast
and
furious
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
every
member
did
engage
in
a
battle
with
those
remnants
of
a
paleozoic
age
and
the
way
they
hurled
those
fossils
in
their
anger
was
a
sin
till
the
skull
of
an
old
mammoth
caved
the
head
of
thompson
in
gooch
then
showed
me
bob
acres
dueling
pistols
they
gave
no
signs
of
having
been
used
and
it
is
doubtful
if
they
would
have
been
very
deadly
at
forty
paces
bob
favorite
fighting
distance
here
was
also
the
with
which
the
ancient
mariner
killed
the
albatross
i
found
hanging
from
a
hook
two
curious
weapons
which
resembled
light
darts
or
spears
my
host
reached
them
down
for
me
and
i
looked
them
over
closely
their
composition
was
apparent
the
halves
of
a
pair
of
scissors
had
been
tied
to
two
wands
they
look
much
more
harmless
than
bob
acres
pistols
do
they
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
used
in
a
duel
and
one
of
them
killed
its
man
the
duel
was
fought
in
edinburgh
castle
between
two
french
prisoners
one
of
whom
was
st
ives
and
the
lasso
that
hangs
above
them
employed
in
a
tournament
by
a
connecticut
yankee
at
king
court
until
merlin
stole
it
this
is
the
sword
with
which
sergeant
troy
displayed
his
dexterity
before
bathsheba
everdene
and
this
blade
you
have
heard
celebrated
in
song
a
good
many
times
it
is
the
sword
of
bunker
hill
and
with
this
miles
standish
stirred
the
posset
here
is
the
revolver
with
which
sherlock
holmes
used
to
amuse
himself
in
his
room
on
baker
street
sitting
in
his
chair
and
making
a
patriotic
in
bullet
pocks
on
the
wall
much
to
the
annoyance
of
the
good
watson
these
daggers
are
rather
odd
four
of
them
and
two
swords
you
see
they
came
from
critic
where
the
two
nieces
draw
their
two
daggers
to
strike
whiskerandos
the
two
uncles
point
their
swords
at
whiskerandos
and
he
draws
two
daggers
and
holds
them
to
the
two
nieces
bosoms
so
they
would
have
stood
forever
if
the
beefeater
had
come
in
and
commanded
them
in
the
queen
name
to
drop
their
weapons
there
the
beefeater
halberd
too
doubtless
wondered
at
this
naval
gun
it
fired
the
shot
that
did
the
business
for
the
and
gave
kipling
a
chance
to
air
his
knowledge
of
engines
and
machinery
in
general
you
can
read
about
it
in
devil
and
the
deep
sea
this
sword
is
in
its
sheath
you
see
sword
was
in
its
sheath
his
fingers
held
the
pen
when
kempenfelt
went
down
with
twice
four
hundred
men
i
plenty
of
swords
here
the
one
that
pierced
the
master
of
ballantrae
when
he
and
his
brother
fought
together
by
this
pretty
little
pair
of
scissors
they
helped
in
the
rape
of
the
lock
this
club
is
my
oldest
specimen
it
belonged
to
ab
you
know
his
story
no
doubt
and
the
big
axe
was
carried
by
the
executioner
when
the
queen
of
hearts
went
about
shouting
with
their
heads
that
is
a
beautiful
dagger
i
remarked
is
it
it
was
brought
by
some
italian
twins
to
a
village
in
missouri
where
it
had
an
exciting
history
look
at
the
finger
prints
in
blood
on
the
handle
they
betrayed
a
murderer
and
he
was
denounced
in
court
by
wilson
we
had
finished
our
circuit
of
the
room
and
it
was
time
for
me
to
bid
gooch
i
started
to
thank
him
for
showing
me
his
collection
but
he
interrupted
oh
that
all
right
but
he
added
laying
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
in
a
paternal
fashion
one
last
request
if
you
write
it
up
for
the
do
try
to
be
funny
i
do
hate
to
have
books
and
libraries
and
literature
treated
flippantly
now
i
read
your
column
oh
very
often
no
yes
i
do
he
persisted
i
do
after
i
have
finished
the
genealogical
department
of
course
and
all
those
other
fellows
the
and
the
bishop
afloat
and
all
the
rest
of
i
read
the
librarian
i
blushed
slightly
and
i
wish
continued
my
host
that
you
would
treat
my
collection
seriously
gooch
i
promised
i
will
be
as
solemn
as
as
oh
as
your
brother
annual
reports
i
can
say
no
more
than
that
