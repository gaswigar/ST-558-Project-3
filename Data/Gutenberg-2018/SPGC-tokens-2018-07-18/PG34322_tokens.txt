note
this
tale
is
offered
to
the
memory
of
one
william
hawkins
a
seaman
and
adventurer
who
was
the
first
englishman
to
reach
the
court
of
jahangir
the
great
moghul
of
india
there
he
delivered
gifts
from
the
new
east
india
company
and
a
letter
from
king
james
proposing
direct
trade
then
a
zealously
protected
monopoly
of
portugal
as
he
gradually
adopted
indian
ways
hawkins
became
a
court
favorite
of
the
moghul
who
made
him
a
knightly
eventually
tried
to
keep
him
in
india
after
several
attempts
to
murder
him
hawkins
attached
himself
for
safety
to
a
certain
willful
indian
woman
the
end
of
their
story
eventually
became
a
minor
legend
throughout
the
early
east
india
company
as
astonishing
as
some
of
the
elements
in
the
historical
landscape
described
here
may
seem
today
they
are
all
by
and
large
fictional
creations
of
actual
events
practices
people
drawn
from
diaries
of
european
travelers
and
from
indian
historical
materials
aside
from
the
names
only
the
clocks
in
this
remote
world
have
been
knowingly
altered
years
in
historical
time
have
become
months
in
these
pages
months
have
become
days
several
vicious
naval
engagements
between
english
frigates
and
portuguese
galleons
several
major
land
battles
between
indian
armies
have
each
been
compressed
into
one
but
the
major
occurrences
in
this
faraway
saga
all
happened
while
shakespeare
wrote
of
commoners
and
kings
while
colonists
hewed
log
cabins
from
the
wilds
of
the
new
world
a
land
ruled
by
violent
intrigue
powerful
drugs
and
sensual
beauty
lay
hidden
in
that
legendary
place
known
as

book
one
landfall
chapter
one
he
watched
from
the
quarterdeck
as
the
chain
fed
through
the
whitecaps
of
the
bay
its
staccato
clatter
muffled
hollow
in
the
midday
heat
then
he
sensed
the
anchor
grab
and
felt
an
uneasy
tremor
pass
along
the
hull
as
the
links
snapped
taut
against
the
tide
the
cannon
were
already
run
in
and
cooling
but
vagrant
threads
of
smoke
still
traced
skyward
through
the
scuttles
and
open
hatch
curling
ringlets
over
two
draped
bodies
by
the
mainmast
along
the
main
deck
seamen
haggard
and
shirtless
to
the
sun
eased
the
wounded
toward
the
shade
of
the
he
drew
the
last
swallow
of
brandy
from
his
hooped
wooden
tankard
and
instinctively
shifted
his
gaze
aloft
squinting
against
the
midday
sun
to
watch
as
two
bosun
mates
edged
along
the
yards
to
furl
the
mainsail
then
he
turned
to
inspect
the
triangular
lateen
sail
behind
him
parted
into
shreds
by
the
first
portuguese
cannon
salvo
its
canvas
now
strewn
among
the
mizzenmast
shrouds
a
round
of
cheers
told
him
the
last
two
casks
of
salt
pork
had
finally
emerged
from
the
smoky
hold
and
he
moved
to
the
railing
to
watch
as
they
were
rolled
toward
the
cauldron
boiling
on
deck
as
he
surveyed
the
faces
of
the
gathering
men
he
asked
himself
how
many
could
still
chew
the
briny
meat
he
had
hoarded
so
carefully
for
this
final
morning
of
the
voyage
the
crowd
parted
as
he
moved
down
the
companionway
steps
and
onto
the
deck
he
was
tall
with
lines
of
fatigue
etched
down
his
angular
face
and
smoke
residue
laced
through
his
unkempt
hair
and
short
beard
his
doublet
was
plain
canvas
and
his
breeches
and
boots
scarcely
differed
from
those
of
a
common
seaman
his
only
adornment
was
a
small
gold
ring
in
his
left
ear
today
he
also
wore
a
bloodstained
binding
around
his
thigh
where
a
musket
shot
from
a
portuguese
maintop
had
furrowed
the
skin
he
was
brian
hawksworth
captain
of
the
english
frigate
of
the
third
voyage
of
england
new
east
india
company
his
commission
assigned
in
london
over
seven
months
past
was
to
take
two
armed
trading
frigates
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
up
the
eastern
coast
of
africa
and
then
through
the
arabian
sea
to
the
northwest
coast
of
india
the
company
had
twice
before
sailed
eastward
from
the
cape
to
the
equatorial
islands
of
the
indies
no
english
vessel
in
history
had
ever
sailed
north
for
india
the
destination
of
this
the
first
english
voyage
to
challenge
control
of
the
india
trade
was
the
port
of
surat
twelve
leagues
inland
up
the
tapti
river
largest
of
the
only
two
harbors
on
the
indian
subcontinent
not
controlled
by
portugal
he
reached
for
the
second
tankard
of
brandy
that
had
been
brought
and
squinted
again
toward
the
mouth
of
the
tapti
where
four
armed
portuguese
galleons
had
been
anchored
earlier
that
morning
damn
the
company
no
one
planned
on
galleons
at
the
river
mouth
not
now
not
this
early
in
the
season
did
the
portugals
somehow
learn
our
destination
and
if
they
knew
that
do
they
know
the
rest
of
the
company
plan
since
the
tapti
had
been
badly
silted
for
decades
navigable
only
by
cargo
barge
or
small
craft
he
and
the
merchants
must
travel
upriver
to
surat
by
pinnace
the
sailboat
lashed
amidships
on
the
main
deck
there
the
merchants
would
try
to
negotiate
england
first
direct
trade
with
india
and
brian
hawksworth
would
undertake
a
separate
mission
one
the
east
india
company
hoped
might
someday
change
the
course
of
trade
throughout
the
indies
he
remounted
the
steps
to
the
quarterdeck
and
paused
to
study
the
green
shoreline
circling
their
inlet
the
hills
undulated
in
the
sun
heat
washing
the
the
dense
perfume
of
land
already
india
beckoned
the
lure
even
stronger
than
all
the
legends
told
he
smiled
to
himself
and
drank
again
this
time
a
toast
to
the
first
english
captain
ever
to
hoist
colors
off
the
coast
of
india
then
with
a
weary
hand
he
reached
for
the
telescope
an
expensive
new
dutch
invention
and
trained
it
on
his
second
frigate
the
anchored
a
musket
shot
away
like
the
she
rode
easily
at
anchor
bearing
to
lee
he
noted
with
relief
that
her
ship
carpenter
had
finally
sealed
a
patch
of
oakum
and
sail
in
the
gash
along
her
portside
bow
for
a
few
hours
now
the
men
on
the
pumps
could
retire
from
the
sweltering
hold
finally
he
directed
the
glass
toward
the
remains
of
two
portuguese
galleons
aground
in
the
sandy
shallows
off
his
starboard
quarter
black
smoke
still
streaming
from
gaps
in
their
planking
where
explosions
had
ripped
through
the
hull
and
for
an
instant
his
stomach
tightened
just
as
it
had
earlier
that
morning
when
one
of
those
same
galleons
had
laid
deep
shadows
across
the
so
close
he
could
almost
read
the
eyes
of
the
infantry
poised
with
grapples
to
swing
down
and
board
the
portugals
will
be
back
he
told
himself
and
soon
with
fireships
he
scanned
the
river
mouth
once
more
it
was
deserted
now
even
the
fishing
craft
had
fled
but
upriver
would
be
another
matter
portuguese
longboats
launched
with
boarding
parties
of
infantry
had
been
stranded
when
the
two
galleons
were
lost
together
they
had
carried
easily
a
hundred
perhaps
two
hundred
musketmen
they
made
for
the
tapti
he
thought
grimly
and
they
be
upriver
waiting
we
have
to
launch
before
they
can
set
a
blockade
tonight
on
the
tide
he
revolved
to
find
giles
mackintosh
quartermaster
of
the
waiting
mutely
by
his
side
mackintosh
start
outfitting
the
pinnace
we
launch
at
sunset
before
the
last
dog
watch
the
quartermaster
pulled
at
his
matted
red
curls
in
silence
as
he
studied
the
river
mouth
then
he
turned
abruptly
to
hawksworth
takin
the
pinnace
upriver
be
a
death
sentence
i
warrant
you
portugals
be
layin
for
us
whores
at
a
tyburn
hangin
he
paused
deliberately
and
knotted
the
string
holding
back
hair
from
his
cheeks
i
say
we
weigh
at
the
tide
and
ease
the
frigates
straight
up
their
river
she
wide
as
the
thames
at
woolwich
we
run
out
the
guns
and
hand
the
papists
another
taste
o
english
courtesy
can
you
navigate
the
sandbars
i
seen
nae
sign
of
bars
the
indian
pilot
we
took
on
yesterday
claims
there
shallows
upriver
all
the
more
reason
to
sail
by
my
thinkin
the
pilot
a
moor
an
they
all
the
same
indian
or
turk
mackintosh
blew
his
nose
over
the
railing
punctuating
his
disgust
show
me
one
that
na
a
liar
a
thief
or
a
damned
sodomite
nae
honest
christian
credit
the
word
of
a
moor
there
risk
either
way
hawksworth
drew
slowly
on
the
brandy
appearing
to
weigh
the
scotsman
views
but
there
the
cargo
to
think
of
taken
for
all
it
got
to
be
the
pinnace
and
this
moorish
pilot
not
like
the
turks
i
should
know
aye
as
you
will
mackintosh
nodded
with
seeming
reluctance
admiring
how
hawksworth
had
retained
mastery
of
their
old
game
even
after
two
years
apart
but
i
be
watchin
the
bastard
move
he
makes
hawksworth
turned
and
slowly
descended
the
quarterdeck
steps
as
he
entered
the
passageway
leading
aft
to
the
great
cabin
and
the
merchants
cabins
he
saw
the
silhouette
of
george
elkington
the
chief
merchant
of
the
voyage
was
standing
by
the
quarter
gallery
railing
drawing
on
a
long
clay
pipe
as
he
urinated
into
the
swells
when
he
spotted
hawksworth
he
whirled
and
marched
heavily
down
the
corridor
perfunctorily
securing
the
single
remaining
button
of
his
breeches
elkington
jowls
were
slack
and
pasty
and
his
stained
doublet
sagged
over
what
had
been
seven
months
past
a
luxuriant
belly
sweat
trickled
down
from
the
sides
of
his
large
hat
streaming
oily
rivulets
across
his
cheeks
hawksworth
did
i
hear
you
order
the
pinnace
launch
tonight
before
we
made
safe
anchorage
for
the
cargo
the
sooner
the
better
the
portugals
know
we
have
to
go
upriver
by
tomorrow
they
be
ready
your
first
obligation
sirrah
is
the
goods
every
shilling
the
company
subscrib
is
cargo
in
these
two
damn
merchantmen
a
fine
fortune
in
wool
broadcloth
devonshire
kersey
pig
iron
tin
quicksilver
i
a
good
ten
thousand
pound
of
my
own
accounts
invest
and
you
leave
it
all
hove
to
in
this
piss
crock
of
a
bay
whilst
the
portugals
are
doubtless
crewin
up
a
dozen
down
the
coast
in
goa
is
sure
they
be
laid
full
about
this
anchorage
inside
a
fortnight
hawksworth
inspected
elkington
with
loathing
musing
what
he
disliked
about
him
most
his
grating
voice
or
his
small
lifeless
eyes
and
what
you
probably
do
realize
is
they
be
back
next
time
with
trained
gunners
not
like
today
when
their
gun
crews
clearly
were
lisbon
dockside
rabble
private
traders
who
earned
passage
out
to
the
indies
on
the
easy
claim
they
were
gunners
half
not
knowing
a
linstock
from
a
lamppost
elkington
i
tell
you
as
much
of
our
plans
as
befits
your
place
hawksworth
moved
past
him
toward
the
door
of
the
great
cabin
taking
the
pinnace
upriver
tonight
on
the
tide
and
you
be
in
it
along
with
your
coxcomb
clerk
captain
kerridge
of
the
will
take
command
of
the
ships
i
already
prepared
orders
to
move
both
frigates
to
a
new
anchorage
i
demand
to
know
what
damn
fool
scheme
you
hatch
there
no
reason
you
have
to
know
right
now
the
fewer
who
know
the
better
particularly
the
men
going
upriver
well
i
know
this
much
hawksworth
this
voyage
to
india
may
well
be
the
east
india
company
last
chance
to
trade
in
the
indies
if
we
fail
three
voyages
in
a
row
we
as
well
close
down
the
company
and
just
buy
pepper
and
spice
outright
from
the
damn
hollanders
england
got
no
goods
that
trade
in
the
spice
islands
south
o
here
remember
lancaster
cargo
wool
down
to
the
islands
on
the
first
two
company
voyages
thinkin
to
swap
it
for
pepper
and
discover
for
himself
what
i
guess
all
along
a
tribe
of
heathens
sweatin
in
the
sun
have
no
call
for
woolen
breeches
so
either
we
trade
up
here
in
the
north
where
they
take
wool
or
we
finish
the
anchorage
i
found
should
keep
the
cargo
and
the
men
safe
till
we
make
surat
with
luck
you
have
your
cargo
aland
before
the
portugals
locate
us
hawksworth
pushed
open
the
heavy
oak
door
of
the
great
cabin
and
entered
stranding
elkington
in
the
passageway
and
now
i
wish
you
good
day
the
cabin
dark
overhead
beams
were
musty
from
the
heat
and
its
air
still
dense
with
smoke
from
the
cannon
the
stern
windows
were
partly
blocked
now
by
the
two
bronze
that
had
been
run
out
aft
cannon
that
could
spit
a
ball
with
deadly
accuracy
their
lighter
bronze
permitting
longer
barrels
than
those
of
the
guns
below
decks
he
strode
directly
to
the
oil
lantern
swaying
over
the
great
center
desk
and
turned
up
the
wick
the
cabin
brightened
slightly
but
the
face
of
the
english
lute
wedged
in
the
corner
seemed
suddenly
to
come
alive
shining
gold
over
the
cramped
quarters
like
a
full
moon
he
stared
at
it
wistfully
for
a
moment
then
shook
his
head
and
settled
himself
behind
the
large
oak
desk
and
asked
himself
once
more
why
he
had
ever
agreed
to
the
voyage
to
prove
something
to
the
company
to
himself
he
reflected
again
on
how
it
had
come
about
and
why
he
had
finally
accepted
the
company
offer
it
had
been
a
dull
morning
in
late
october
the
kind
of
day
when
all
london
seems
trapped
in
an
icy
gloom
creeping
up
from
the
thames
his
weekly
lodgings
were
frigid
as
always
and
his
mind
was
still
numb
from
the
previous
night
tavern
brandy
back
from
tunis
scarcely
a
month
he
already
had
nothing
left
to
pawn
two
years
before
he
had
been
leading
a
convoy
of
merchantmen
through
the
mediterranean
when
their
ships
and
cargo
were
seized
by
turkish
corsairs
galleys
owned
by
the
notorious
tunis
he
had
finally
managed
to
get
back
to
london
but
now
he
was
a
captain
without
a
ship
in
years
past
this
might
have
been
small
matter
to
remedy
but
no
longer
england
he
discovered
had
changed
the
change
was
apparent
mainly
to
seamen
the
lower
house
of
parliament
was
still
preoccupied
fighting
king
james
new
proposal
that
scotland
be
joined
to
england
viewed
by
most
englishmen
as
a
sufferance
of
proud
beggars
and
ruffians
upon
a
nation
of
uniformly
upright
taxpayers
in
london
idle
crowds
still
swarmed
the
bear
gardens
to
wager
on
the
huge
mastiffs
pitted
against
the
chained
bears
rioting
tenant
farmers
continued
to
outrage
propertied
men
by
tearing
down
enclosures
and
grazing
their
flocks
on
the
gentry
private
hunting
estates
and
the
new
puritans
increasingly
harassed
everyone
they
disapproved
of
from
clerics
who
wore
vestments
to
women
who
wore
cosmetics
to
children
who
would
play
ball
on
sunday
around
london
more
talk
turned
on
which
handsome
young
courtier
was
the
latest
favorite
of
their
effeminate
new
king
than
on
his
enforcement
of
his
new
and
strict
decree
forbidding
privateering
the
staple
occupation
of
england
seamen
for
the
last
three
decades
of
elizabeth
reign
king
james
had
cravenly
signed
a
treaty
of
peace
with
spain
and
by
that
act
brought
ruin
to
half
a
hundred
thousand
english
sea
dogs
they
awoke
to
discover
their
historic
livelihood
legally
plundering
the
shipping
of
spain
and
portugal
under
wartime
letters
of
marque
had
become
a
criminal
offense
for
a
captain
without
a
ship
another
commission
by
a
trading
company
seemed
out
of
the
question
and
especially
now
with
experienced
seamen
standing
idle
the
length
of
london
worst
of
all
the
woman
he
had
hoped
to
return
to
maggie
tyne
of
billingsgate
had
disappeared
from
her
old
lodgings
and
haunts
leaving
no
trace
rumor
had
her
married
some
said
to
the
master
of
a
newcastle
coal
barge
others
to
a
gentleman
london
seemed
empty
now
and
he
passed
the
vacant
days
with
brandy
and
his
lute
and
thoughts
of
quitting
the
sea
to
do
he
knew
not
what
then
in
that
cold
early
dawn
appeared
the
letter
requesting
his
immediate
appearance
at
the
director
office
of
the
east
india
company
should
this
coincide
with
his
convenience
he
found
its
tone
ominous
was
some
merchant
planning
to
have
him
jailed
for
his
loss
of
cargo
to
the
turks
but
he
been
sailing
for
the
levant
company
not
the
east
india
company
he
debated
with
himself
all
morning
and
finally
decided
to
go
and
face
the
mercantile
bastards
the
new
offices
of
the
company
already
seemed
embalmed
in
the
smell
of
lamp
oil
and
sweat
their
freshly
painted
wood
timbers
masked
in
dull
soot
a
stale
odor
of
ink
paper
and
arid
commerce
assailed
his
senses
as
he
was
announced
and
ushered
through
the
heavy
oak
door
of
the
director
suite
and
he
was
astonished
by
what
awaited
standing
hard
by
the
desk
was
maggie
he
searched
the
length
of
london
in
vain
for
her
and
here
she
was
but
he
almost
did
recognize
her
their
two
years
apart
had
brought
a
change
beyond
anything
he
could
have
imagined
no
one
would
have
guessed
what
she
once
had
been
a
dockside
girl
happiest
at
the
southwark
or
in
a
bed
and
somehow
she
had
always
managed
to
turn
a
shilling
at
both
wagering
with
a
practiced
eye
on
the
snarling
dogs
brought
in
to
bloody
the
bears
or
taking
her
pleasure
only
after
deftly
extracting
some
loan
to
allay
an
urgent
need
she
inevitably
remembered
the
moment
she
entered
his
lodgings
that
morning
however
she
reigned
like
an
exotic
flower
flourishing
amid
the
mercantile
gloom
she
was
dressed
and
painted
in
the
very
latest
style
her
red
hair
now
bleached
deep
yellow
sprinkled
thick
with
gold
dust
and
buried
under
a
feathered
hat
her
bodice
cut
fashionably
just
below
the
nipples
then
tied
at
the
neck
with
a
silk
lace
ruff
her
breasts
now
painted
pale
with
blue
veins
penciled
in
and
her
face
carefully
powdered
save
the
red
dye
on
her
lips
and
cheeks
and
the
beauty
patches
of
stars
and
his
dockside
girl
had
become
a
completely
modern
lady
of
fashion
he
watched
in
disbelief
as
she
curtsied
to
him
awkwardly
then
he
noticed
sir
randolph
spencer
director
of
the
company
captain
hawksworth
so
you
the
man
we
heard
so
much
about
understand
you
escaped
from
tunis
under
the
very
nose
of
the
damned
turks
he
extended
a
manicured
hand
while
he
braced
himself
on
the
silver
knob
of
his
cane
although
spencer
flowing
hair
was
pure
white
his
face
still
clung
tenuously
to
youth
his
doublet
was
expensive
and
in
the
new
longer
style
hawksworth
remembered
seeing
on
young
is
indeed
a
pleasure
nay
is
an
honor
the
tone
was
practiced
and
polite
a
transparent
attempt
at
sincerity
rendered
difficult
by
hawksworth
ragged
appearance
he
had
listened
to
spencer
mutely
suddenly
realizing
his
loss
of
cargo
had
been
forgotten
he
was
being
congratulated
for
coming
back
alive
was
the
wife
margaret
here
set
me
thinkin
about
you
says
you
two
were
lightly
acquainted
in
younger
years
pity
i
never
knew
her
then
myself
spencer
motioned
him
toward
a
carved
wooden
chair
facing
the
desk
she
ask
to
be
here
today
to
help
me
welcome
you
uncommonly
winsome
lady
what
say
hawksworth
looked
at
maggie
gloating
eyes
and
felt
his
heart
turn
it
was
obvious
enough
she
found
her
price
at
last
she
had
what
always
really
wanted
a
rich
widower
but
why
trouble
to
flaunt
it
he
suspected
he
already
knew
she
simply
could
resist
now
i
pride
myself
on
being
a
sound
judge
of
humanity
hawksworth
and
i
made
sufficient
inquiry
to
know
you
can
work
a
ship
with
the
best
so
i
come
right
to
it
i
suppose
is
common
talk
the
dispatchin
another
voyage
down
to
the
indies
this
comin
spring
soon
as
our
new
frigate
the
is
out
of
the
yard
and
this
time
our
first
port
of
call
to
be
india
spencer
caught
look
without
realizing
it
was
directed
past
him
at
maggie
aye
i
know
we
all
know
the
damned
portugals
been
there
a
hundred
year
thick
as
flies
on
pudding
but
by
jesus
we
no
choice
but
to
try
openin
india
to
english
trade
spencer
had
paused
and
examined
hawksworth
skeptically
a
process
of
sizing
up
seemed
underway
of
pondering
whether
this
shipless
captain
with
the
bloodshot
eyes
and
gold
earring
was
really
the
man
he
looked
down
and
inspected
his
manicured
nails
for
a
long
moment
then
continued
now
what
i
about
to
tell
you
must
go
past
this
room
but
first
let
me
ask
you
is
everything
i
heard
about
you
true
is
said
the
tunis
held
you
there
after
he
took
your
merchantmen
in
hopes
you
teach
his
damned
turks
how
to
use
the
english
cannon
you
had
on
board
he
started
building
sailing
bottoms
now
thinking
he
replace
the
galleys
his
turkish
pirates
have
used
for
so
long
his
shipwrights
are
some
english
privateers
who
relocated
in
tunis
to
escape
prison
here
and
he
was
planning
to
outfit
his
new
sailing
ships
with
my
cannon
he
claims
english
culverin
are
the
best
in
the
world
god
damn
the
barbary
turks
and
the
englishmen
who
started
helping
them
spencer
bristled
next
thing
and
they
be
out
past
gibraltar
pillaging
our
shipping
right
up
the
thames
but
i
understand
you
revised
his
plans
the
turks
do
have
any
more
cannon
now
than
they
had
two
years
ago
when
i
refused
to
help
them
they
put
me
in
prison
under
guard
but
one
night
i
managed
to
knife
two
of
the
guards
and
slip
down
to
the
yard
i
worked
till
dawn
and
had
the
guns
spiked
before
anybody
realized
i
was
gone
and
i
hear
you
next
stole
a
shallop
and
sail
the
length
of
the
barbary
coast
alone
right
up
to
gibraltar
where
you
hailed
an
english
merchantman
did
seem
much
point
in
staying
on
after
that
you
the
man
all
right
now
is
said
you
learn
the
language
of
the
turks
while
you
were
in
tunis
well
sirrah
answer
me
now
can
you
speak
it
or
no
for
two
years
i
scarcely
heard
a
word
of
english
but
what
that
to
do
with
trade
in
india
from
what
i
know
you
need
a
few
merchants
who
speak
portuguese
and
plenty
of
english
hear
me
out
sir
if
all
i
wanted
was
to
anchor
a
cargo
of
english
goods
and
pull
off
some
trade
for
a
season
i
not
be
needin
a
man
like
you
but
let
me
tell
you
a
thing
or
so
about
india
the
rulers
there
now
are
named
moghuls
they
used
to
be
called
mongols
from
turkistan
before
they
took
over
india
about
a
hundred
years
back
and
their
king
the
one
they
call
the
great
moghul
still
speaks
some
turki
the
language
of
the
central
asian
steppes
now
i
told
this
turki
bears
fair
resemblance
to
the
language
of
the
damned
turks
in
the
mediterranean
spencer
assumed
a
conspiratorial
smile
i
a
plan
in
mind
but
it
needs
a
man
who
speaks
this
great
moghul
language
hawksworth
suddenly
realized
maggie
must
have
somehow
convinced
spencer
he
was
the
only
seaman
in
england
who
knew
turkish
it
could
scarcely
be
true
now
i
ask
you
hawksworth
what
the
purpose
of
the
east
india
company
well
is
to
trade
wool
for
pepper
and
spice
simple
as
that
to
find
a
market
for
english
commodity
mainly
wool
and
to
ship
home
with
cheap
pepper
now
we
can
buy
all
the
pepper
we
like
down
in
java
and
sumatra
but
they
not
take
wool
in
trade
and
if
we
keep
on
buying
there
with
gold
there
never
be
a
farthing
profit
in
our
voyages
to
the
indies
by
the
same
token
we
sure
these
moghuls
in
north
india
will
take
wool
they
already
buy
it
from
the
damned
portugals
but
they
do
grow
pepper
spencer
leaned
forward
and
his
look
darkened
slightly
the
hard
fact
is
the
east
india
company
not
done
nearly
as
well
as
our
subscribers
hoped
but
now
the
idea
come
along
i
hate
to
admit
was
george
elkington
first
thought
of
it
that
we
try
swappin
wool
for
the
cotton
goods
they
produce
in
north
india
then
ship
these
south
and
trade
for
pepper
and
spice
indian
traders
have
sold
their
cotton
calicoes
in
the
spice
islands
for
years
do
you
follow
the
strategy
spencer
had
scrutinized
hawksworth
for
a
moment
puzzling
at
his
flash
of
anger
when
elkington
name
was
mentioned
then
pressed
forward
overall
not
a
bad
idea
considerin
it
came
from
elkington
then
spencer
dropped
his
voice
to
just
above
a
whisper
but
what
he
understand
is
if
we
goin
to
start
tradin
in
india
we
need
a
real
treaty
like
the
hollanders
have
down
in
some
of
the
islands
because
once
you
got
a
treaty
you
can
settle
a
permanent
trading
station
what
we
call
a
and
bargain
year
round
buy
when
prices
are
best
hawksworth
sensed
the
interview
would
not
be
short
and
he
settled
uneasily
into
the
chair
maggie
still
stood
erect
and
formal
affecting
a
dignity
more
studied
than
natural
as
spencer
warmed
to
his
subject
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
now
sir
once
we
have
a
factory
we
can
start
sending
in
a
few
cannon
to
our
merchants
like
the
hollanders
do
in
the
islands
and
soon
enough
we
got
the
locals
edgy
handle
it
right
and
pretty
soon
they
sign
over
exclusive
trade
no
more
competition
spencer
smiled
again
in
private
satisfaction
are
you
startin
to
follow
my
thinkin
what
you
described
is
the
very
arrangement
the
portugals
have
in
india
now
hawksworth
tried
to
appear
attentive
but
he
could
keep
his
eyes
off
maggie
who
stood
behind
spencer
wearing
a
triumphant
smile
and
they
got
plenty
of
cannon
and
sail
to
make
sure
their
trade
exclusive
we
know
all
about
the
portugals
fleet
of
warships
and
their
shipyards
in
goa
and
all
the
rest
but
these
things
always
take
time
took
the
portugals
many
a
year
to
get
their
hooks
into
india
ports
but
their
days
are
numbered
there
hawksworth
the
whole
eastern
empire
of
the
portugals
is
rotten
i
can
almost
smell
it
but
if
we
dally
about
the
damned
hollanders
are
sure
to
move
in
spencer
had
become
increasingly
excited
and
hawksworth
watched
as
he
began
pacing
about
the
room
well
if
you
saying
you
want
a
treaty
why
not
just
send
an
ambassador
to
the
great
moghul
court
damn
me
hawksworth
it
not
that
easy
we
send
some
dandified
gentry
who
does
know
the
language
and
he
end
up
havin
to
do
all
his
talkin
through
court
interpreters
and
who
might
they
be
well
let
me
just
show
you
sirrah
spencer
began
to
shuffle
impatiently
through
the
papers
on
his
desk
they
jesuits
damned
jesuits
papists
straight
out
o
lisbon
we
know
for
a
fact
they
do
all
the
for
the
court
in
agra
he
paused
as
he
rummaged
the
stacks
in
front
of
him
we
just
got
hold
of
some
jesuit
letters
sent
out
from
the
moghul
capital
at
agra
through
goa
intended
for
lison
they
tell
you
plain
enough
what
the
company
up
against
his
search
became
increasingly
frenetic
damn
me
they
were
here
he
rose
and
shuffled
toward
the
door
waving
his
cane
in
nervous
agitation
hold
a
minute
hawksworth
had
watched
him
disappear
through
the
doorway
then
looked
back
to
see
maggie
laughing
she
retrieved
a
packet
from
the
mantel
and
tossed
it
carelessly
onto
the
desk
he
found
himself
watching
her
in
admiration
realizing
some
things
never
change
what
the
hell
this
about
she
smiled
and
her
voice
was
like
always
methinks
is
plain
enough
you
want
me
gone
from
london
this
badly
he
takes
care
o
me
at
least
he
loves
me
something
you
were
capable
of
and
what
were
you
capable
of
all
you
wanted
was
i
she
looked
away
i
know
he
give
me
what
you
would
at
least
he
has
feelin
for
me
more
than
you
did
or
could
then
she
turned
back
and
looked
at
him
for
a
long
moment
say
you
go
knowin
you
still
damn
it
all
spencer
burst
back
through
the
doorway
then
he
spied
the
leather
packet
that
it
he
seized
the
bundle
and
thrust
it
toward
hawksworth
read
these
through
sirrah
and
you
see
clear
enough
what
we
up
against
there
absolutely
no
point
whatever
in
postin
a
real
ambassador
now
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
though
unsure
how
to
phrase
his
next
point
the
most
amazing
thing
is
what
they
say
about
the
great
moghul
himself
the
one
they
call
arangbar
the
jesuits
claim
the
man
scarcely
ever
sober
seems
he
lives
on
some
kind
of
poppy
sap
they
call
opium
and
on
wine
he
a
moor
sure
enough
but
he
drinks
like
a
christian
downs
a
full
gallon
of
wine
a
day
holds
audiences
with
a
flagon
in
his
hand
from
the
letters
i
can
sense
the
jesuits
all
marvel
how
the
damned
heathen
does
it
but
they
swear
is
true
no
sirrah
we
ca
send
some
ambassador
now
that
later
we
want
a
man
of
quality
it
goes
without
sayin
but
he
got
to
be
able
to
drink
with
that
damned
moor
and
parlay
with
him
in
his
cups
no
jesuit
interpreters
hawksworth
steadied
his
hand
on
the
carved
arm
of
the
chair
still
amazed
by
maggie
what
will
your
subscribers
think
about
sending
the
captain
of
a
merchantman
to
the
court
of
moghul
india
never
you
mind
the
subscribers
just
tell
me
if
you
consider
it
be
a
hard
voyage
and
a
perilous
trip
inland
once
you
make
landfall
but
you
sail
the
mediterranean
half
a
decade
and
you
know
enough
about
the
turks
spencer
tapped
his
fingers
impatiently
on
his
blotter
and
lest
you
worried
have
no
doubt
the
company
knows
how
to
reward
success
hawksworth
looked
again
at
maggie
her
blue
eyes
were
mute
as
stone
to
tell
the
truth
i
not
sure
i
interested
in
a
voyage
to
india
george
elkington
might
be
able
to
tell
you
the
reason
why
have
you
told
me
all
of
it
damn
elkington
what
he
to
do
with
this
spencer
stopped
in
front
of
the
desk
and
fixed
hawksworth
gaze
aye
there
more
but
what
i
about
to
tell
you
now
absolutely
has
to
remain
between
us
so
have
i
your
word
hawksworth
found
himself
nodding
very
well
sir
then
i
give
you
the
rest
his
majesty
king
james
is
sending
a
personal
letter
to
be
delivered
to
this
great
moghul
and
gifts
all
the
usual
diplomatic
falderal
these
potentates
expect
deliver
the
whole
affair
now
the
letter
offer
full
and
free
trade
between
england
and
india
nothing
more
wo
mention
the
portugals
that
come
later
this
is
just
the
beginning
for
now
all
we
want
is
a
treaty
to
trade
alongside
the
damned
papists
break
their
monopoly
but
why
all
the
secrecy
is
plain
as
a
pikestaff
sirrah
the
fewer
know
what
we
plannin
the
less
chance
of
word
gettin
out
to
the
portugals
or
the
hollanders
let
the
papists
and
the
butterboxes
look
to
their
affairs
after
we
have
a
treaty
remember
the
portugals
are
swarmin
about
the
moghul
court
audiences
every
day
not
to
mention
a
fleet
of
warships
holdin
the
entire
coast
and
if
they
spy
your
colors
they
not
apt
to
welcome
you
aland
for
roast
capon
and
grog
who
else
knows
about
this
nobody
least
of
all
that
windbag
elkington
who
have
it
talk
the
length
of
cheapside
in
a
fortnight
he
be
on
the
voyage
i
regret
to
say
but
just
as
chief
merchant
which
is
all
he
fit
for
though
warrant
he
presumes
otherwise
i
like
a
few
days
to
think
about
it
hawksworth
looked
again
at
maggie
still
disbelieving
first
i
like
to
see
the
and
i
also
like
to
see
your
navigation
charts
for
the
indian
ocean
seen
plenty
of
logs
down
to
the
cape
and
east
but
nothing
north
from
there
and
with
good
reason
we
got
no
rutters
north
of
the
cape
no
english
sea
dog
ever
sail
it
but
i
made
some
inquiries
and
i
think
i
located
a
salt
here
who
shipp
it
once
a
long
time
past
a
dutchman
named
huyghen
the
truth
is
he
was
born
and
rais
right
here
in
london
he
started
out
a
papist
and
when
things
got
a
bit
hot
in
england
back
around
time
of
the
armada
he
left
for
holland
took
a
dutch
name
next
he
mov
on
down
to
portugal
thinkin
to
be
a
jesuit
then
shipp
out
to
goa
and
round
the
indies
but
he
got
a
bellyfull
of
popery
soon
enough
and
came
back
to
amsterdam
some
years
later
he
help
out
their
merchants
by
tellin
them
exactly
how
the
portugals
navigate
the
passage
round
the
cape
and
out
the
hollanders
say
been
for
the
maps
he
drew
up
they
never
have
been
able
to
double
the
cape
in
the
first
place
but
he
back
in
london
now
and
we
him
down
i
understand
he
may
gone
a
bit
daft
but
perhaps
do
no
harm
if
you
spoke
to
him
and
what
about
the
i
want
to
see
her
too
that
you
will
sir
she
in
our
shipyard
down
at
deptford
might
be
well
if
i
just
had
huyghen
see
you
there
by
all
means
look
her
over
he
beamed
and
a
lovelier
sight
you
like
to
meet
then
remembering
himself
he
quickly
turned
aside
unless
of
course
be
my
margaret
here
as
agreed
hawksworth
was
taken
to
deptford
the
next
day
the
carriage
inching
through
london
teeming
streets
for
what
seemed
a
lifetime
his
first
sight
of
the
shipyard
was
a
confused
tangle
of
planking
ropes
and
workmen
but
he
knew
at
a
glance
the
was
destined
to
be
handsome
the
keel
had
been
laid
weeks
before
and
he
could
already
tell
her
would
be
low
and
rakish
she
was
a
hundred
and
thirty
feet
from
the
red
lion
of
her
beakhead
to
the
taffrail
at
her
stern
where
gilding
already
was
being
applied
to
the
ornate
quarter
galleries
she
was
five
hundred
tons
burden
each
ton
some
six
hundred
cubic
feet
of
cargo
space
and
she
would
carry
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
when
fully
crewed
over
her
swarmed
an
army
of
carpenters
painters
coopers
riggers
and
joiners
while
skilled
artisans
were
busy
attaching
newly
gilded
sculptures
to
her
bow
and
stern
that
day
they
were
completing
the
installation
of
the
hull
that
would
secure
deadeyes
for
the
shrouds
and
he
moved
closer
to
watch
stories
had
circulated
the
docks
that
less
than
a
month
into
the
company
last
voyage
the
mainmast
yard
of
a
vessel
had
split
and
the
shipbuilder
william
benten
and
his
foreman
edward
chandler
had
narrowly
escaped
charges
of
lining
their
pockets
by
substituting
cheap
uncured
wood
he
noticed
that
barrels
of
beer
had
been
stationed
around
the
yard
for
the
workmen
to
blunt
the
lure
of
nearby
alehouses
and
as
he
stood
watching
he
saw
chandler
seize
a
grizzled
old
bystander
who
had
helped
himself
to
a
tot
of
beer
and
begin
forcibly
evicting
him
from
the
yard
as
they
passed
he
heard
the
old
man
clad
in
a
worn
leather
jerkin
his
face
ravaged
by
decades
of
salt
wind
and
hard
drink
reviling
the
company
what
does
the
rottin
east
india
company
know
o
the
indies
double
the
cape
in
that
pissin
shallop
scarce
serve
to
ferry
the
thames
the
old
man
struggled
weakly
to
loosen
grasp
on
his
jerkin
but
i
can
tell
you
th
portugals
got
carracks
that
do
it
full
easy
bottoms
that
hold
this
skiff
in
the
orlop
deck
and
leave
air
for
a
hundred
barrel
o
biscuit
an
shipped
by
all
the
saints
where
the
man
standin
that
knows
the
indies
better
hawksworth
realized
he
must
be
huyghen
he
intercepted
him
at
the
edge
of
the
yard
and
invited
him
to
a
tavern
but
the
old
dutchman
bitterly
declined
i
ha
none
o
your
fancy
taverns
lad
aswarm
wi
gentry
fingerin
their
meat
pies
they
take
in
the
likes
o
me
then
he
examined
hawksworth
and
flashed
a
toothless
grin
but
there
an
alehouse
right
down
the
way
where
a
man
wi
salt
in
his
veins
can
still
taste
a
drop
in
peace
they
went
and
hawksworth
had
ordered
the
first
round
when
the
tankards
arrived
huyghen
attacked
his
thirstily
maintaining
a
cynical
silence
as
hawksworth
began
describing
the
company
planned
voyage
then
asked
him
what
he
knew
of
the
passage
east
and
north
of
the
cape
as
soon
as
his
first
tankard
was
dry
the
old
man
spoke
aye
i
made
the
passage
once
wi
portugals
back
to
goa
i
been
to
the
indies
many
a
time
since
wi
dutchmen
but
again
to
that
pissin
sinkhole
but
what
about
the
passage
north
through
the
indian
ocean
i
tell
you
this
lad
is
a
sight
different
from
shootin
down
to
java
like
the
company
done
before
is
the
roughest
passage
like
to
ship
portugals
post
bottoms
twice
the
burden
o
the
company
damn
little
frigates
and
still
lose
a
hundred
men
voyage
out
when
scurvy
do
take
all
the
dutchmen
are
scared
o
it
then
huyghen
returned
to
his
stories
of
goa
something
in
the
experience
seemed
to
preoccupy
his
mind
hawksworth
found
the
digression
irritating
and
he
impatiently
pressed
forward
but
what
about
the
passage
how
do
they
steer
north
from
the
cape
the
company
has
no
charts
no
rutters
by
pilots
made
the
passage
an
how
could
they
huyghen
evaluated
hawksworth
purse
lying
on
the
wooden
table
and
discreetly
signaled
another
round
the
portugals
know
the
trick
lad
but
you
find
one
o
the
whoremasters
give
it
out
but
is
there
a
trade
wind
you
can
ride
like
the
westerly
to
the
americas
nothin
o
the
sort
lad
but
there
a
wind
sure
enough
only
she
shifts
about
month
by
month
give
me
that
chart
an
i
show
you
huyghen
stretched
for
the
parchment
hawksworth
had
brought
the
new
map
of
the
world
published
by
john
davis
in
he
spread
it
over
the
table
oblivious
to
the
grease
and
encrusted
ale
and
stared
at
it
for
a
moment
in
groggy
disbelief
then
he
turned
on
hawksworth
who
drew
up
this
map
it
was
assembled
by
an
english
navigator
from
charts
he
made
on
his
voyages
he
the
lyin
son
of
a
spaniard
whore
i
made
this
chart
o
the
indies
wi
my
own
hand
years
ago
for
the
dutchmen
but
what
the
difference
he
copied
it
right
huyghen
spat
on
the
floor
and
then
stabbed
the
east
coast
of
africa
with
a
stubby
finger
now
you
come
out
o
the
mozambique
channel
and
into
the
indian
ocean
too
early
in
the
summer
and
you
be
the
only
bottom
fool
enough
to
be
out
port
the
monsoon
batter
you
to
plankin
get
there
too
late
say
past
the
middle
o
september
and
you
fightin
a
head
wind
all
the
way
she
already
turn
on
you
but
come
north
round
by
sokatra
near
the
end
o
august
and
you
ride
a
steady
gale
right
into
north
india
that
the
tail
o
the
monsoon
lad
just
before
the
winds
switch
about
two
weeks
three
at
most
that
all
you
get
but
steer
it
true
an
you
make
landfall
just
as
india
ports
reopen
for
the
autumn
tradin
season
huyghen
voice
trailed
off
as
he
morosely
inspected
the
bottom
of
his
tankard
hawksworth
motioned
for
a
third
round
and
as
the
old
man
drew
on
the
ale
his
eyes
mellowed
aye
you
might
make
it
there
a
look
about
you
tells
me
you
can
work
a
ship
but
why
would
you
want
to
be
goin
swallow
you
up
lad
i
only
been
to
goa
mind
you
down
on
india
west
coastline
but
that
was
near
enough
i
saw
a
man
come
back
once
he
went
in
india
proper
somethin
about
it
keeps
there
portugals
says
she
always
changes
a
man
he
loses
touch
wi
what
he
was
nothin
we
know
about
counts
for
anything
there
lad
what
do
you
mean
how
different
could
it
be
i
saw
plenty
of
moors
in
tunis
huyghen
laughed
bitterly
if
you
thinkin
is
the
same
as
tunis
then
you
a
bigger
fool
than
i
took
you
for
nay
lad
the
moor
part
the
very
least
o
it
he
drew
on
his
tankard
slowly
deliberately
i
thought
o
a
considerable
time
an
i
think
decipher
what
is
but
is
not
a
thing
easy
to
spell
out
huyghen
was
beginning
to
drift
now
his
eyes
glazed
in
warm
forgetfulness
from
the
ale
but
still
he
continued
you
know
lad
i
actually
saw
some
englishmen
go
into
india
once
before
back
in
year
i
was
in
goa
an
they
were
heard
from
since
hawksworth
stared
at
the
old
man
a
moment
and
suddenly
the
name
clicked
and
the
date
huyghen
must
have
been
the
dutch
catholic
the
one
said
to
speak
fluent
english
who
intervened
for
the
english
scouting
party
imprisoned
in
goa
that
year
by
the
portuguese
he
tried
to
still
his
pulse
do
you
remember
the
englishmen
names
seem
to
recall
they
were
led
by
a
man
nam
symmes
but
was
a
long
time
past
lad
aye
goa
was
quite
the
place
then
lucky
i
escap
when
i
did
there
you
stay
awhile
an
somethin
starts
to
hold
you
too
much
o
india
about
the
place
after
a
while
all
this
huyghen
gestured
fondly
about
the
alehouse
where
laborers
and
seamen
were
drinking
quarreling
swearing
as
they
bargained
with
a
scattering
of
weary
prostitutes
in
dirty
tattered
shifts
all
this
seems
he
took
a
deep
draft
of
ale
attempting
vainly
to
formulate
his
thoughts
i
been
one
wi
words
but
do
do
it
lad
you
go
in
go
all
the
way
in
to
india
an
i
wager
be
heard
from
more
i
seen
it
happen
hawksworth
listened
as
huyghen
continued
his
stories
of
the
indies
a
mixture
of
ale
and
dreams
after
a
time
he
signaled
another
round
for
them
both
it
was
many
empty
tankards
later
when
they
parted
but
huyghen
words
stayed
and
that
night
brian
hawksworth
walked
alone
on
the
quay
beside
the
thames
bundled
against
the
wet
autumn
wind
and
watched
the
ferry
lanterns
ply
through
the
fog
and
heard
the
muffled
harangues
of
streetwalkers
and
cabmen
from
the
muddy
street
above
he
thought
about
huyghen
and
about
the
man
named
roger
symmes
and
about
the
voyage
to
india
and
he
thought
too
about
maggie
who
wanted
him
out
of
london
before
her
rich
widower
discovered
the
truth
or
before
she
admitted
the
truth
to
herself
but
either
way
it
no
longer
seemed
to
matter
that
night
he
decided
to
accept
the
commission
the
heavily
and
hawksworth
glanced
instinctively
toward
the
pulley
lines
that
secured
the
two
bronze
cannon
then
he
remembered
why
he
had
left
the
quarterdeck
and
he
unlocked
the
top
drawer
of
the
desk
and
removed
the
ship
log
he
leafed
one
more
time
through
its
pages
admiring
his
own
script
strong
but
with
an
occasional
flourish
someday
this
could
be
the
most
valuable
book
in
england
he
told
himself
if
we
return
this
will
be
the
first
log
in
england
to
describe
what
the
voyage
to
india
is
really
like
the
company
will
have
a
full
account
of
the
weather
and
sea
recorded
by
estimated
longitude
the
distance
traveled
east
he
congratulated
himself
again
on
the
care
with
which
he
had
taken
their
daily
speed
and
used
it
to
estimate
longitude
every
morning
since
the
cape
the
last
location
where
it
was
known
exactly
and
as
he
studied
the
pages
of
the
log
he
realized
how
exact
prediction
had
been
the
old
man
had
been
eerily
correct
about
the
winds
and
the
sea
they
had
caught
the
tail
o
the
monsoon
precisely
august
course
ft
the
wind
at
with
gusts
and
rain
made
leagues
today
estimated
longitude
from
the
cape
august
course
the
wind
at
west
a
fresh
gale
with
gusts
and
rain
this
hours
leagues
estimated
longitude
from
the
cape
the
late
august
westerly
huyghen
had
foretold
was
carrying
them
a
good
hundred
land
miles
a
day
they
rode
the
monsoon
tail
and
it
was
still
angry
but
there
was
no
longer
a
question
that
english
frigates
could
weather
the
passage
as
august
drew
to
a
close
however
scurvy
had
finally
grown
epidemic
on
his
sister
ship
the
the
men
teeth
loosened
their
gums
bled
and
they
began
to
complain
of
aching
and
burning
in
their
limbs
it
was
all
the
more
tragic
for
the
fact
that
this
timeless
scourge
of
ocean
travelers
might
at
long
last
be
preventable
lancaster
on
the
very
first
voyage
of
the
east
india
company
had
stumbled
onto
an
historic
as
a
test
he
shipped
bottles
of
the
juice
of
lemons
on
his
flagship
and
ordered
every
seaman
to
take
three
spoonfuls
a
day
and
his
had
been
the
only
vessel
of
the
three
to
withstand
scurvy
hawksworth
had
argued
with
captain
kerridge
of
the
insisting
they
both
stow
lemon
juice
as
a
preventative
but
kerridge
had
always
resented
lancaster
particularly
the
fact
he
been
knighted
on
return
from
a
voyage
that
showed
almost
no
profit
he
refused
to
credit
lancaster
findings
no
connection
by
my
thinkin
lancaster
just
had
a
run
o
luck
then
he
goes
about
claimin
salt
meat
brings
on
the
scurvy
a
pack
o
damn
foolishness
i
say
salt
meat
fine
for
the
lads
boil
it
up
with
a
mess
o
dried
peas
and
i
have
it
myself
the
be
provision
like
always
sea
biscuit
salt
pork
hollander
cheese
any
fool
knows
scurvy
comes
from
men
sleepin
in
the
night
dews
off
the
sea
secure
your
gunports
by
night
and
you
see
the
damn
scurvy
hawksworth
had
suspected
kerridge
real
reason
was
the
cost
lemon
juice
was
imported
and
expensive
when
the
company
rejected
his
own
request
for
an
allowance
he
had
provisioned
the
of
his
own
advance
kerridge
had
called
him
a
fool
and
when
they
sailed
in
late
february
the
was
unprovided
just
as
hawksworth
had
feared
the
had
been
plagued
by
scurvy
throughout
the
voyage
even
though
both
vessels
had
put
in
for
fresh
provisions
at
zanzibar
in
late
june
six
weeks
ago
he
had
had
no
choice
but
to
order
half
his
own
remaining
store
of
lemon
juice
transferred
to
the
sister
ship
even
though
this
meant
reducing
the
ration
to
a
spoon
a
day
not
enough
by
the
first
week
of
september
they
were
so
near
india
they
could
almost
smell
land
but
he
dared
not
try
for
landfall
not
yet
not
without
an
indian
pilot
to
guide
them
past
the
notorious
sandbars
and
shoals
that
lined
the
coast
like
giant
submerged
claws
the
monsoon
winds
were
dying
indian
shipping
surely
would
begin
soon
so
they
hove
to
waiting
and
as
they
waited
they
watched
the
last
kegs
of
water
choke
with
green
slime
the
wax
candles
melt
in
the
heat
and
the
remaining
biscuit
all
but
disappear
to
weevils
hungry
seamen
set
a
price
on
the
rats
that
ran
the
shrouds
how
long
could
they
last
hawksworth
reached
the
last
entry
in
the
log
yesterday
the
day
they
had
waited
for
laid
by
the
lee
estimated
longitude
from
the
cape
latitude
observed
at
in
the
morning
we
command
a
large
ship
from
the
country
to
heave
to
by
shooting
four
pieces
across
her
bow
took
from
this
ship
an
indian
pilot
paying
in
spanish
rials
of
eight
first
offered
english
gold
sovereigns
but
these
refused
as
unknown
coin
also
purchased
casks
water
some
baskets
lemons
melons
plantains
the
provisions
had
scarcely
lasted
out
the
day
spread
over
twice
a
hundred
hungry
seamen
but
with
a
pilot
they
could
at
last
make
landfall
and
landfall
they
had
made
at
a
terrible
price
yet
even
this
anchorage
could
not
be
kept
it
was
too
exposed
and
vulnerable
he
had
expected
it
to
be
so
and
he
had
been
right
but
he
also
knew
where
they
might
find
safety
the
previous
night
he
had
ordered
the
indian
pilot
to
sketch
a
chart
of
the
coastline
on
both
sides
of
the
tapti
river
delta
he
did
not
tell
him
why
and
on
the
map
he
had
spotted
a
cove
five
leagues
to
the
north
called
swalley
that
looked
to
be
shallow
and
was
also
shielded
by
hills
screening
it
from
the
sea
even
if
the
portuguese
discovered
them
the
deep
draft
of
portuguese
galleons
would
hold
them
at
sea
the
most
they
could
do
would
be
send
boarding
parties
by
pinnace
or
fireships
the
cove
would
buy
time
time
to
replenish
stores
perhaps
even
to
set
the
men
ashore
and
attend
the
sick
the
longer
the
anchorage
could
be
kept
secret
the
better
their
chances
he
had
already
prepared
sealed
orders
for
captain
kerridge
directing
him
to
steer
both
frigates
there
after
dark
when
their
movement
could
not
be
followed
by
the
hidden
eyes
along
the
coast
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
flipped
forward
to
a
blank
page
in
the
log
and
realized
this
was
the
moment
he
had
been
dreading
been
postponing
the
last
entry
for
the
voyage
out
perhaps
his
last
ever
if
events
in
india
turned
against
him
he
swabbed
more
sweat
from
his
face
and
glanced
one
last
time
at
the
glistening
face
of
the
lute
wondering
what
he
would
be
doing
now
at
this
moment
if
he
still
were
in
london
penniless
but
on
his
own
then
he
wiped
off
the
quill
lying
neatly
alongside
the
volume
inked
it
and
shoved
back
the
sleeve
of
his
doublet
to
write
chapter
two
the
events
of
that
morning
were
almost
too
improbable
to
be
described
after
taking
on
the
indian
pilot
hawksworth
plan
had
been
to
make
landfall
immediately
then
launch
a
pinnace
for
surat
there
to
negotiate
trade
for
their
goods
and
safe
conduct
to
the
capital
at
agra
for
himself
if
things
went
as
planned
the
goods
would
be
exchanged
and
he
would
be
on
his
way
to
the
moghul
capital
long
before
word
of
their
arrival
could
reach
goa
and
the
portuguese
the
pilot
worth
was
never
in
question
a
practiced
seaman
he
had
steered
them
easily
through
the
uncharted
currents
and
hidden
swallows
of
the
bay
they
had
plotted
a
course
directly
running
with
topgallants
on
the
night
breeze
to
make
dawn
anchorage
at
the
mouth
of
the
tapti
river
through
the
night
the
had
stayed
with
them
handily
steering
by
their
stem
lantern
when
the
first
light
broke
in
the
east
hard
and
sudden
there
it
lay
the
coast
of
india
the
landfall
the
sight
they
had
waited
for
the
long
seven
months
amid
the
cheers
he
had
ordered
their
colors
hoisted
the
red
cross
bordered
in
white
on
a
field
of
blue
the
first
english
flag
ever
to
fly
off
india
coast
but
as
the
flag
snapped
its
way
along
the
poop
staff
and
the
men
struck
up
a
hornpipe
on
deck
their
triumph
suddenly
was
severed
by
a
cry
from
the
maintop
sails
off
the
starboard
quarter
in
the
sudden
hush
that
rolled
across
the
ship
like
a
shroud
freezing
the
tumult
of
voice
and
foot
hawksworth
had
charged
up
the
companionway
to
the
quarterdeck
and
there
while
the
masts
tuned
a
melancholy
dirge
he
had
studied
the
ships
in
disbelief
with
his
glass
four
galleons
anchored
at
the
river
mouth
portuguese
each
easily
a
thousand
ton
twice
the
size
of
the
he
had
sorted
quickly
through
his
options
strike
sail
and
heave
to
on
the
odds
they
may
leave
it
was
too
late
run
up
portuguese
colors
the
old
privateers
ruse
and
possibly
catch
them
by
surprise
unlikely
come
about
and
run
for
open
sea
never
that
never
an
english
seadog
way
no
keep
to
windward
and
engage
here
in
the
bay
mackintosh
hawksworth
turned
to
see
the
quartermaster
already
poised
expectantly
on
the
main
deck
order
malloyre
to
draw
up
the
gunports
have
the
sails
wet
down
and
see
the
cookroom
fire
is
out
aye
sir
this
be
a
bloody
one
what
counts
is
who
bleeds
most
get
every
able
man
on
station
as
hawksworth
turned
to
check
the
whipstaff
the
long
wooden
lever
that
guided
the
ship
rudder
he
passingly
noted
that
curious
conflict
of
body
sensation
he
remembered
from
two
encounters
in
years
past
once
when
on
the
amsterdam
run
he
had
seen
privateers
suddenly
loom
off
the
coast
of
scotland
and
then
on
his
last
voyage
through
the
mediterranean
when
his
convoy
first
spotted
the
turkish
pirate
galleys
while
his
mind
calculated
the
elements
of
a
strategy
coolly
refining
each
individual
detail
his
stomach
belied
his
rational
facade
and
knotted
in
instinctive
primal
fear
and
he
had
asked
himself
whether
this
day
his
mind
or
his
body
would
prevail
the
odds
were
very
bad
even
if
they
could
keep
the
wind
and
if
the
portuguese
had
trained
gun
crews
then
he
spotted
the
indian
pilot
leaning
casually
against
the
steering
house
his
face
expressionless
he
wore
a
tiny
moustache
and
long
trimmed
sideburns
and
unlike
the
english
seamen
all
barefoot
and
naked
to
the
waist
he
was
still
dressed
formally
just
as
when
he
came
aboard
a
fresh
turban
of
white
cotton
embroidered
in
a
delicate
brown
was
secured
neatly
about
the
crown
of
his
head
exposing
his
long
ears
and
small
jeweled
earrings
a
spotless
yellow
cloak
covered
the
waist
of
his
tightly
tailored
blue
trousers
damn
him
did
he
somehow
know
did
he
steer
us
into
a
trap
seeming
to
read
hawksworth
thoughts
the
pilot
broke
the
silence
between
them
his
turki
heavily
accented
with
his
native
gujarati
this
is
your
first
test
officers
of
the
moghul
army
are
doubtless
at
the
shore
observing
what
will
you
do
what
do
you
think
we
do
we
stand
the
bastards
and
with
malloyre
gunners
i
think
we
can
then
permit
me
an
observation
a
modest
thought
but
possibly
useful
do
you
see
there
he
pulled
erect
and
pointed
toward
the
shore
hard
by
the
galleons
there
where
the
seabirds
swirl
in
a
dark
cloud
that
is
the
river
mouth
and
on
either
side
are
many
sandbars
borne
there
from
the
river
delta
along
the
coast
beyond
these
though
you
can
not
see
them
now
are
channels
too
shallow
for
the
draft
of
a
galleon
but
perhaps
safe
for
these
frigates
reach
them
and
you
will
be
beyond
range
of
all
portuguese
ordnance
save
their
stern
then
they
will
be
forced
to
try
boarding
you
by
longboat
something
their
infantry
does
poorly
and
with
great
reluctance
are
there
channels
on
both
sides
of
the
river
mouth
to
windward
and
to
leeward
certainly
my
captain
he
examined
hawksworth
with
a
puzzled
stare
but
only
a
fool
would
not
hold
to
port
to
windward
hawksworth
studied
the
shoreline
with
the
glass
and
an
audacious
gamble
began
to
take
form
in
his
mind
why
try
to
keep
both
frigates
to
windward
that
what
they
expect
and
any
moment
now
they
weigh
and
beat
to
windward
also
and
from
their
position
they
probably
gain
the
weather
gage
forcing
us
to
leeward
downwind
where
we
maneuver
that
means
an
open
fight
when
the
can
barely
muster
a
watch
how
can
she
crew
the
gun
deck
and
man
the
sheets
but
maybe
she
wo
have
to
maybe
there
another
way
mackintosh
the
quartermaster
was
mounting
the
quarterdeck
companionway
order
the
and
reefed
and
the
shortened
we
heave
to
while
we
run
out
the
guns
and
signal
the
while
i
prepare
orders
for
kerridge
the
grizzled
scotsman
stood
listening
in
dismay
and
hawksworth
read
his
thoughts
precisely
in
his
eyes
there
nae
time
to
heave
to
and
for
wha
we
strike
an
inch
o
canvas
an
the
fornicatin
take
the
weather
gage
sure
ha
you
nae
stomach
for
a
fight
why
na
just
haul
down
colors
and
ha
done
with
it
but
he
said
nothing
he
turned
automatically
and
bellowed
orders
aloft
hawksworth
felt
out
the
morning
breeze
tasting
its
cut
while
he
watched
the
seamen
begin
swinging
themselves
up
the
shrouds
warming
the
morning
air
with
oaths
as
the
and
heeled
in
the
chop
and
then
he
turned
and
strode
down
the
quarterdeck
companionway
toward
the
great
cabin
to
prepare
orders
for
the
as
he
passed
along
the
main
deck
half
a
dozen
crewmen
were
already
unlashing
the
longboat
from
its
berth
amidships
and
when
he
emerged
again
on
deck
with
the
wrapped
dispatch
after
what
seemed
only
moments
the
longboat
was
already
launched
oarsmen
at
station
he
passed
the
packet
to
mackintosh
without
a
word
then
mounted
the
companionway
ladder
back
to
the
quarterdeck
the
indian
pilot
stood
against
the
banister
shaded
by
the
lateen
sail
calmly
studying
the
galleons
three
of
these
i
know
very
well
his
accented
turki
was
almost
lost
in
a
roll
of
spray
off
the
stern
they
are
the
the
and
the
they
arrived
new
from
lisbon
last
year
after
the
monsoon
to
patrol
our
shipping
lanes
to
enforce
the
regulation
that
all
indian
vessels
purchase
a
trading
license
from
authorities
in
goa
and
what
of
the
fourth
it
is
said
she
berthed
in
goa
only
this
spring
i
do
not
know
her
name
there
were
rumors
she
brought
the
new
viceroy
but
early
before
his
term
began
i
have
never
before
seen
her
north
in
these
waters
my
god
hawksworth
looked
at
the
warships
in
dismay
is
this
the
course
of
the
company
fortune
a
voyage
depending
on
secrecy
blunders
across
a
fleet
bearing
the
incoming
viceroy
of
goa
the
most
powerful
portuguese
in
the
indies
they
are
invincible
the
pilot
continued
his
voice
still
fact
the
galleons
own
our
waters
they
have
two
decks
of
guns
no
indian
vessel
even
the
reckless
corsairs
along
our
southern
coast
of
malabar
dare
meet
them
in
the
open
sea
owners
who
refuse
to
submit
and
buy
a
portuguese
trading
license
must
sail
hundreds
of
leagues
off
course
to
avoid
their
patrol
and
what
do
you
propose
that
we
heave
to
and
strike
our
colors
without
even
a
fight
hawksworth
was
astonished
by
the
pilot
casual
unconcern
is
he
owned
by
the
portugals
too
you
may
act
as
you
choose
i
have
witnessed
many
vain
boasts
of
english
bravery
during
my
brief
service
aboard
your
ship
but
an
indian
captain
would
choose
prudence
at
such
a
time
strike
colors
and
offer
to
pay
for
a
license
otherwise
you
will
be
handled
as
a
pirate
no
englishman
will
ever
pay
a
portugal
or
a
spaniard
for
a
license
to
trade
or
a
permit
to
piss
hawksworth
turned
away
trying
to
ignore
the
cold
sweat
beading
on
his
chest
we
never
have
we
never
will
the
pilot
watched
him
for
a
moment
and
then
smiled
you
are
in
the
seas
off
india
now
captain
here
the
portuguese
have
been
masters
for
a
hundred
years
his
voice
betrayed
a
trace
of
annoyance
at
hawksworth
seeming
preoccupation
and
he
moved
closer
you
would
do
well
to
hear
me
out
we
know
the
portuguese
very
well
better
perhaps
than
you
their
cruelties
here
began
a
full
century
ago
when
the
barbarous
captain
vasco
de
gama
first
discovered
our
malabar
coast
near
the
southern
tip
of
india
he
had
the
portuguese
nose
for
others
wealth
and
when
he
returned
again
with
twenty
ships
our
merchants
rose
against
him
but
he
butchered
their
fleet
and
took
prisoners
by
the
thousand
he
did
not
however
simply
execute
them
first
he
cut
away
their
ears
noses
and
hands
and
sent
these
to
the
local
raja
recommending
he
make
a
curry
next
a
portuguese
captain
named
albuquerque
came
with
more
warships
to
ravage
our
trade
in
the
north
that
on
the
red
sea
and
when
servants
of
islam
again
rose
up
to
defend
what
is
ours
allah
the
merciful
once
more
chose
to
turn
his
face
from
them
leaving
all
to
defeat
soon
the
infidel
portuguese
came
with
many
fleets
and
in
a
span
no
more
than
a
male
child
reaching
manhood
had
seized
our
ocean
and
stolen
our
trade
the
pilot
face
remained
blandly
expressionless
as
he
continued
but
he
reached
out
and
caught
hawksworth
sleeve
next
they
needed
a
portuguese
trading
station
so
they
bribed
pirates
to
help
storm
our
coastal
fortress
at
goa
an
island
citadel
with
a
deep
port
and
this
place
they
made
the
collection
point
for
all
the
pepper
spices
jewels
dyes
silver
and
gold
they
have
plundered
from
us
they
lacked
the
courage
to
invade
india
herself
as
the
moghuls
did
soon
after
so
they
made
our
sea
their
infidel
empire
it
is
theirs
from
the
coast
of
africa
to
the
gulf
of
persia
to
the
molucca
islands
and
they
seek
not
merely
conquest
or
enforced
commerce
but
also
our
conversion
to
their
religion
of
cruelty
they
have
flooded
our
ports
with
ignorant
priests
to
them
this
is
a
crusade
against
islam
against
the
one
true
faith
a
crusade
that
has
triumphed
for
a
time
where
barbarous
christian
land
assaults
on
our
holy
mecca
have
always
failed
then
the
pilot
turned
directly
to
hawksworth
and
a
smile
flickered
momentarily
across
his
lips
and
now
you
english
have
come
to
challenge
them
by
sea
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
smile
even
if
you
prevail
today
which
i
must
tell
you
i
doubt
and
even
if
one
day
more
of
your
warships
follow
and
drive
them
from
our
seas
entirely
even
if
all
this
should
take
place
you
will
find
your
victory
hollow
as
theirs
has
been
for
we
have
already
destroyed
them
the
way
india
consumes
all
who
come
with
arms
the
ancient
way
they
have
robbed
our
wealth
but
in
return
we
have
consumed
their
spirit
until
at
last
they
are
left
with
nothing
but
empty
commodity
it
will
be
no
different
for
you
english
captain
you
will
never
have
india
it
is
india
who
will
have
you
he
paused
and
looked
again
toward
the
galleons
their
sails
swelling
on
the
horizon
but
today
i
think
the
portuguese
will
spare
us
the
trouble
hawksworth
examined
the
pilot
struggling
to
decipher
his
words
let
me
tell
you
something
about
england
all
we
ask
is
trade
for
you
and
for
us
and
we
do
have
any
priests
to
send
only
catholic
traders
do
that
and
if
you
think
we
not
stand
well
today
you
know
even
less
about
the
english
the
thing
we
do
best
is
fight
at
sea
our
sea
dogs
destroyed
the
entire
navy
of
spain
twenty
years
ago
when
they
sent
their
armada
to
invade
england
and
even
to
this
day
the
spaniards
and
portugals
have
never
understood
our
simple
strategy
they
still
think
a
warship
merely
a
land
fortress
afloat
all
they
know
to
do
is
throw
infantry
against
a
ship
and
try
to
board
her
the
english
know
sea
battles
are
won
with
cannon
and
maneuverability
not
soldiers
hawksworth
directed
the
pilot
gaze
down
the
the
ship
was
of
the
new
english
class
low
in
the
water
and
swift
absent
were
the
bulky
superstructures
on
bow
and
stern
that
weighed
down
a
galleon
the
castles
that
spanish
and
portuguese
commanders
used
to
stage
infantry
for
boarding
an
enemy
vessel
a
full
thirty
years
before
the
english
seaman
and
explorer
john
hawkins
had
scoffed
at
these
as
had
francis
drake
and
walter
raleigh
they
saw
clearly
that
the
galleons
towering
bow
and
stem
their
forecastle
and
poop
slow
them
since
the
bluff
beamy
hull
needed
to
support
their
weight
would
bite
the
water
a
superstructure
above
decks
serves
only
to
spoil
a
warship
handling
in
a
breeze
they
declared
and
to
lend
a
better
target
to
an
english
gunner
your
ships
assuredly
are
smaller
than
portuguese
galleons
i
agree
the
pilot
volunteered
after
a
pause
but
i
see
no
advantage
in
this
you
see
soon
enough
the
be
low
but
she
sail
within
six
points
of
the
wind
and
she
quicker
on
the
helm
than
anything
afloat
hawksworth
raised
the
glass
and
studied
the
galleons
again
as
he
expected
they
were
beating
to
windward
laboring
under
a
full
head
of
canvas
good
now
the
can
make
her
move
the
longboat
was
returning
its
prow
biting
the
trough
of
each
swell
while
on
the
seamen
swarmed
the
shrouds
and
rigging
hawksworth
watched
with
satisfaction
as
his
sister
ship
main
course
swiveled
precisely
into
the
breeze
and
her
bellied
for
a
run
down
the
wind
her
orders
were
to
steer
to
leeward
skirting
the
edge
of
the
galleons
cannon
range
and
if
i
know
the
portugals
he
told
himself
they
be
impatient
enough
to
start
loosing
round
after
round
of
shot
at
her
even
from
a
quarter
mile
off
it
takes
courage
to
hold
fire
till
you
under
an
enemy
guns
but
only
then
do
you
have
accuracy
noise
and
smoke
are
battle
enough
for
most
portugals
but
the
main
result
is
to
overheat
and
immobilize
their
cannon
as
the
lay
hove
to
biding
time
the
cut
directly
down
the
leeward
side
of
the
galleons
laboring
under
full
press
of
sail
masts
straining
against
the
load
the
indian
pilot
watched
the
frigate
in
growing
astonishment
then
turned
to
hawksworth
your
english
frigates
may
be
swift
but
your
english
strategy
is
unworthy
of
a
common
who
commands
an
old
with
greater
cunning
your
sister
frigate
has
now
forfeited
the
windward
position
why
give
over
your
only
advantage
even
as
he
spoke
the
four
portuguese
warships
caught
beating
to
windward
began
to
shorten
sail
and
pay
off
to
leeward
to
intercept
the
their
bows
slowly
crossing
the
wind
as
they
turned
i
made
a
gamble
something
a
portugal
would
never
do
hawksworth
replied
and
now
i
have
to
do
something
no
englishman
would
ever
do
unless
outgunned
and
forced
to
before
the
pilot
could
respond
hawksworth
was
gone
heading
for
the
gun
deck
the
ring
of
his
boots
on
the
oak
ladder
leading
to
the
lower
deck
was
lost
in
the
grind
of
wooden
trucks
as
seamen
threw
their
weight
against
the
heavy
ropes
and
tackles
slowly
hauling
out
the
guns
the
was
armed
with
two
rows
of
culverin
and
she
had
sailed
with
barrels
of
powder
and
almost
four
hundred
round
shot
hawksworth
had
also
stowed
a
supply
of
crossbar
shot
and
deadly
langrel
thin
casings
filled
with
iron
fragments
for
use
against
enemy
rigging
and
sail
at
close
quarters
shafts
of
dusty
light
from
the
gunports
and
overhead
scuttles
relieved
the
gloom
illuminating
the
massive
beams
supporting
the
decks
above
sleeping
hammocks
were
lashed
away
but
the
space
was
airless
already
sultry
from
the
morning
sun
and
the
rancid
tang
of
sweat
mixed
with
fresh
saltpeter
from
the
gunpowder
caught
in
hawksworth
mouth
bittersweet
he
walked
down
the
deck
alert
to
the
details
that
could
spell
victory
or
loss
first
he
checked
the
wooden
tubs
of
vinegared
urine
and
the
long
swabs
stationed
between
the
cannon
used
for
cleaning
burning
fragments
of
metal
from
the
smoking
barrels
after
each
round
fail
to
swab
a
barrel
and
there
could
be
an
unplanned
detonation
when
the
next
powder
charge
was
tamped
into
place
then
he
counted
the
of
powder
now
swathed
in
blankets
to
fend
off
sparks
and
watched
as
edward
malloyre
the
man
some
called
the
best
master
gunner
in
england
inspected
each
cannon
touchhole
as
its
lead
plate
was
removed
assuring
himself
it
had
not
corroded
from
the
gases
expelled
during
their
last
gunnery
practice
in
the
mozambique
channel
master
malloyre
aye
sir
all
in
order
we
hand
the
spanish
bastards
a
taste
english
iron
malloyre
who
had
never
troubled
to
differentiate
portugal
from
spain
was
built
like
a
bear
with
short
bowed
legs
and
a
frame
he
drew
himself
erect
his
balding
pate
easily
clearing
the
rugged
overhead
beams
and
searched
the
gloom
the
worshipful
company
may
ha
signed
on
a
sorry
lot
o
pimpin
apple
squires
but
by
jesus
i
made
englishmen
o
them
my
sovereign
to
your
shilling
we
hole
the
papists
wi
the
first
round
i
stand
the
wager
malloyre
and
add
the
last
keg
of
brandy
but
you
earn
it
i
want
the
portside
battery
loaded
with
crossbar
forward
and
langrel
aft
and
set
the
langrel
for
the
decks
not
the
sail
malloyre
stared
at
him
incredulously
the
command
told
him
immediately
that
this
would
be
a
battle
with
no
quarter
the
use
of
langrel
against
personnel
left
no
room
for
truce
then
suddenly
the
true
implications
of
hawksworth
command
hit
him
like
a
blow
in
the
chest
that
for
close
quarters
we
lay
alongside
and
the
bastards
grapple
and
board
us
sure
swarm
us
like
curs
on
a
bitch
that
the
order
malloyre
be
quick
on
it
set
the
starboard
round
first
and
light
the
linstocks
hawksworth
turned
to
count
the
shot
and
absently
picked
up
one
of
the
linstocks
lying
on
deck
an
plated
staff
used
to
set
off
a
cannon
fingering
the
match
rope
at
its
tip
and
inhaling
its
dank
musk
and
the
smell
awoke
again
the
memory
of
that
last
day
two
years
before
in
the
mediterranean
with
turkish
pirate
galleys
fore
and
aft
when
there
had
been
no
quarter
and
no
hope
beggin
your
pardon
sir
malloyre
voice
was
urgent
bringing
him
back
what
the
firin
orders
just
fire
the
starboard
round
as
a
broadside
and
set
for
the
lower
gun
deck
aye
aye
sir
he
paused
and
lord
jesus
pray
we
live
to
swab
out
malloyre
parting
words
would
have
followed
him
up
the
ladder
to
the
main
deck
but
they
were
swallowed
in
the
muffled
roll
of
cannon
fire
sounding
over
the
bay
the
galleons
were
spreading
circling
the
as
they
bore
down
upon
her
and
they
had
begun
to
vomit
round
after
round
jets
of
water
randomly
around
the
frigate
as
she
plunged
toward
the
shallows
and
safety
any
minute
now
hawksworth
told
himself
and
she
be
in
the
shallows
if
she
does
run
aground
on
a
bar
then
he
saw
the
begin
to
come
about
reefing
and
furling
her
sails
she
made
the
shallows
and
the
portugals
guns
have
quieted
permission
to
set
sail
sir
the
bleedin
portugals
be
on
her
in
a
trice
mackintosh
stood
on
the
quarterdeck
by
the
steering
house
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
the
anxiety
in
his
eyes
give
the
portugals
time
mackintosh
and
you
see
their
second
fatal
mistake
the
first
was
overheating
the
cannon
on
their
upper
decks
the
second
will
be
to
their
crews
they
out
of
cannon
range
now
so
they
launch
longboats
and
assign
half
the
watch
as
oarsmen
here
take
the
glass
tell
me
what
you
see
mackintosh
studied
the
shallows
with
the
telescope
while
a
smile
slowly
grew
on
his
hard
face
i
a
motherless
dutchman
an
there
a
king
guard
o
portugal
musketmen
loadin
in
wearin
their
silver
helmets
they
have
changed
in
thirty
years
hawksworth
smiled
to
himself
the
portugals
still
think
their
infantry
is
too
dignified
to
row
so
they
assign
their
crews
to
the
oars
and
leave
their
warships
shorthanded
but
they
wo
find
it
easy
to
board
the
from
longboats
not
with
english
musketmen
in
her
maintop
and
that
should
give
us
just
enough
time
are
all
the
longboats
out
yet
mackintosh
aye
sir
the
quartermaster
steadied
the
glass
against
the
roll
of
the
ship
and
making
for
the
they
was
runnin
from
hell
itself
then
bear
full
sail
two
points
to
windward
of
the
bastard
on
the
left
full
press
and
hoist
the
spritsail
keep
the
wind
and
pay
her
room
till
we
in
range
with
an
exultant
whoop
mackintosh
jabbed
the
telescope
toward
hawksworth
and
began
bellowing
orders
to
the
mates
within
moments
sails
unfurled
and
snapped
in
the
wind
sending
the
bow
biting
into
the
chop
and
hurtling
spray
over
the
bulwarks
hawksworth
kept
to
the
quarterdeck
studying
the
nearest
warship
with
the
glass
the
galleon
forecastle
towered
above
the
horizon
now
like
some
gothic
fortress
and
with
the
glass
he
could
make
out
pennants
blazoned
from
all
her
yardarms
then
he
turned
toward
the
indian
pilot
whose
gaze
was
riveted
on
the
portuguese
warships
what
the
name
of
the
galleon
on
the
left
the
large
one
hawksworth
pointed
toward
the
vessel
he
had
been
observing
with
the
glass
i
ca
read
it
from
this
distance
that
one
is
the
we
know
her
to
be
heavily
armed
i
say
she
over
a
thousand
tons
burden
i
wonder
how
handy
be
with
her
best
men
out
in
the
longboats
she
meet
you
soon
enough
with
her
full
bounty
it
is
said
that
last
year
she
caught
and
sank
a
dutch
frigate
trading
in
the
moluccas
she
still
have
to
come
about
into
the
wind
hawksworth
seemed
not
to
hear
the
pilot
now
so
absorbed
was
he
in
the
looming
battle
as
though
in
answer
to
his
thoughts
the
ventura
to
heel
slowly
about
like
an
angered
bull
but
the
now
had
the
windward
position
secure
and
the
portuguese
ship
would
have
to
tack
laboriously
into
the
wind
her
canvas
was
and
she
would
be
slow
we
got
the
weather
gage
now
hawksworth
told
himself
and
we
hold
it
then
he
noticed
that
the
second
galleon
in
the
row
the
had
also
begun
wearing
around
bringing
her
stern
across
the
wind
as
she
too
turned
to
meet
the
they
deciphered
our
plan
hawksworth
said
quietly
to
himself
and
now
it
two
of
the
bastards
we
face
but
with
luck
we
engage
the
before
the
sebastian
beat
to
range
and
the
is
drawing
away
from
the
fleet
that
bit
of
bravado
will
cost
her
the
closing
rapidly
on
the
in
minutes
they
would
be
within
range
mackintosh
was
at
the
whipstaff
now
holding
their
course
his
senses
alert
to
every
twist
in
the
wind
he
involuntarily
clenched
and
unclenched
his
teeth
while
his
knuckles
were
bloodless
white
from
his
grip
on
the
hardwood
steering
lever
hawksworth
raised
the
glass
again
knowing
what
he
hoped
to
see
the
portugals
have
just
made
their
third
mistake
mackintosh
he
tried
to
mask
his
excitement
they
sealed
the
lower
gunports
to
shut
out
water
while
they
tacking
so
after
they
get
position
they
still
have
to
run
out
the
lower
guns
aye
that
why
wo
buy
a
whore
chastity
on
a
day
like
this
but
they
have
the
upper
guns
on
us
soon
enough
wait
and
see
mackintosh
i
warrant
their
upper
guns
are
overheated
by
now
they
think
twice
about
trying
to
prime
them
just
yet
they
have
to
wait
a
bit
perhaps
just
long
enough
for
us
to
get
alongside
then
the
upper
guns
touch
nothing
but
our
rigging
the
breeze
freshened
even
more
driving
the
toward
her
target
mackintosh
eyed
the
galleon
nervously
knowing
the
frigate
was
heavily
outgunned
finally
he
could
bear
the
tension
no
longer
we
got
range
now
permission
to
bring
her
about
steady
as
she
goes
they
slow
on
the
helm
hawksworth
glanced
at
the
line
of
seamen
along
the
port
side
untying
bundles
of
musket
arrows
and
lighting
the
linstock
bosun
are
the
men
at
stations
aye
sir
a
gravel
voice
sounded
through
the
din
stocks
were
a
bit
damp
but
i
warrant
the
hellish
sun
dryin
out
we
give
the
fornicators
a
fine
english
salute
hawksworth
gauged
the
galleon
course
estimating
her
speed
and
her
ability
to
maneuver
then
he
saw
her
start
coming
about
in
the
water
turning
to
position
the
starboard
battery
for
a
broadside
gunports
on
the
lower
deck
flipped
up
and
cannon
began
slowly
to
emerge
like
hard
black
fangs
nervous
sweat
began
to
bead
on
mackintosh
brow
as
the
her
course
directly
down
the
galleon
windward
side
the
broadside
battery
was
not
yet
set
but
a
sudden
burst
of
black
smoke
from
her
starboard
sent
a
ball
smashing
through
the
gallery
removing
much
of
its
ornate
embellishment
then
came
another
flare
of
smoke
and
flame
hurtling
a
second
ball
through
the
lateen
sail
above
mackintosh
head
the
quartermaster
went
pale
and
looked
imploringly
at
hawksworth
steady
as
she
goes
mackintosh
they
still
have
fully
set
their
guns
the
knot
in
hawksworth
stomach
was
like
a
searing
ball
of
fire
god
for
a
brandy
but
we
got
to
hold
till
we
got
sure
range
to
come
about
now
would
keep
our
distance
and
mean
a
classic
battle
one
we
sure
to
lose
he
pushed
away
the
realization
of
the
immense
chance
they
were
taking
but
now
there
was
no
turning
back
even
if
he
wanted
finally
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
god
make
it
right
now
mackintosh
bring
her
hard
about
the
quartermaster
threw
his
weight
against
the
whipstaff
shouting
orders
to
the
two
seamen
on
the
deck
below
to
haul
the
tackles
on
the
tiller
helping
him
flip
the
rudder
then
he
turned
and
bellowed
commands
to
the
mates
hands
to
the
braces
bring
her
hard
about
the
seamen
poised
incredulously
in
the
maintop
and
foretop
cheered
as
they
began
to
haul
in
the
ropes
securing
the
yards
and
in
moments
the
sails
swiveled
off
the
wind
the
in
the
chopping
seas
responding
readily
to
the
shift
in
rudder
and
canvas
by
this
time
hawksworth
was
standing
over
the
scuttle
above
the
gun
deck
shouting
to
malloyre
coming
about
prepare
to
fire
the
starboard
battery
when
your
guns
bear
the
had
wheeled
a
sharp
arc
in
the
water
laying
herself
broadside
to
the
galleon
hardly
fifty
yards
away
the
english
seamen
aloft
stared
mutely
at
the
towering
forecastle
of
the
portuguese
warship
most
never
before
having
seen
a
galleon
at
close
range
although
the
guns
on
her
upper
deck
were
still
silent
had
they
spoken
now
they
would
have
touched
nothing
but
the
frigate
but
as
the
galleon
turned
the
cannon
on
her
lower
deck
were
coming
into
final
position
in
moments
she
would
lay
the
with
a
broadside
hawksworth
watched
her
carefully
calculating
and
then
the
knot
in
his
stomach
dissolved
like
ice
in
the
sun
the
be
in
position
seconds
ahead
malloyre
command
to
fire
cut
the
silence
the
next
instant
a
low
roar
seemed
to
emanate
from
all
the
timbers
of
the
english
frigate
while
flame
tongued
from
her
starboard
side
the
ship
heeled
dangerously
sideways
while
black
smoke
acrid
and
searing
boiled
up
through
the
scuttles
and
hatch
as
though
propelled
on
its
way
by
the
round
of
cheers
from
below
decks
the
traditional
salute
of
ship
gunners
hawksworth
later
remembered
noting
that
the
battery
had
fired
in
perfect
unison
not
losing
the
set
of
a
single
gun
by
the
ship
recoil
a
medley
of
screams
came
first
piercing
the
blackened
air
then
the
smoke
drifted
downwind
over
the
side
of
the
revealing
a
savage
incision
where
her
lower
gun
deck
had
once
been
cannon
were
thrown
askew
and
the
mangled
forms
of
portuguese
gunners
many
with
limbs
shattered
or
missing
could
be
seen
through
the
splintered
hull
but
hawksworth
did
not
pause
to
inspect
the
damage
he
was
already
yelling
the
next
orders
to
mackintosh
hoping
to
be
heard
above
the
din
the
advantage
of
surprise
would
be
pay
off
the
helm
bring
her
hard
about
again
the
rudder
swiveled
in
its
locks
while
seamen
aloft
hauled
the
sheets
and
braces
but
this
time
the
about
easily
using
the
wind
to
advantage
as
he
turned
to
check
the
whipstaff
hawksworth
heard
a
ricochet
off
the
steering
house
and
sensed
a
sudden
dry
numbness
in
his
thigh
only
then
did
he
look
up
to
see
the
line
of
portuguese
musketmen
on
the
decks
of
the
firing
sporadically
at
the
english
seamen
on
decks
and
aloft
damn
a
lucky
shot
by
some
lisbon
recruit
he
seized
a
handful
of
coarse
salt
from
a
bucket
by
the
binnacle
and
pressed
it
against
the
blood
a
flash
of
pain
passed
briefly
through
his
consciousness
and
then
was
forgotten
the
had
crossed
the
wind
there
was
no
time
to
lose
he
moved
down
the
companionway
to
again
shout
orders
to
malloyre
on
the
gun
deck
set
for
the
and
rigging
fire
as
your
guns
bear
the
still
lay
immobile
so
unexpected
had
been
the
broadside
but
a
boarding
party
of
portuguese
infantry
was
poised
on
the
galleon
forecastle
superstructure
armed
with
swords
and
pikes
ready
to
fling
grapples
and
swing
aboard
the
frigate
the
portuguese
had
watched
in
helpless
amazement
as
the
completely
came
about
and
again
was
broadside
suddenly
the
captain
of
the
infantry
realized
what
was
in
store
and
yelled
frantically
at
his
men
to
take
cover
but
his
last
command
was
lost
in
the
roar
of
the
this
time
flames
and
smoke
erupted
from
the
battery
but
now
it
spewed
chunks
of
metal
and
twisting
crossbars
again
the
screams
came
first
as
the
musketmen
and
infantry
on
the
were
swept
across
the
decks
in
the
deadly
rain
crossbars
chewed
through
the
galleon
mainsail
parting
it
into
two
flapping
remnants
while
the
rigging
on
the
foremast
was
blown
by
the
boards
tangling
and
taking
with
it
a
party
of
musketmen
stationed
in
the
foretop
now
the
galleon
bobbed
helpless
in
the
water
as
the
last
seamen
remaining
on
the
shrouds
plunged
for
the
decks
and
safety
when
you
ready
mackintosh
the
quartermaster
signaled
the
bosun
and
a
line
of
seamen
along
the
port
gunwales
touched
musket
arrows
to
the
lighted
linstock
and
took
aim
streaks
of
flame
forked
into
the
tattered
rigging
of
the
and
in
moments
her
canvas
billowed
red
again
the
portuguese
were
caught
unaware
and
only
a
few
manned
water
buckets
to
extinguish
the
burning
shreds
of
canvas
drifting
to
the
deck
they
were
almost
alongside
now
but
no
portuguese
infantry
would
pour
down
the
side
of
the
forecastle
onto
their
decks
the
galleon
decks
were
a
hemorrhage
of
the
wounded
and
dying
by
jesus
is
a
sight
for
english
eyes
edward
malloyre
blackened
face
streaked
with
sweat
bobbed
up
through
the
hatch
over
the
gun
deck
and
he
surveyed
the
wreckage
of
the
had
to
give
a
look
see
if
my
lads
earn
their
biscuit
he
beamed
with
open
pride
malloyre
how
does
it
stand
below
decks
hawksworth
yelled
from
the
quarterdeck
starboard
side
swabbed
out
how
shall
we
load
sir
malloyre
leaned
backward
to
gain
a
better
look
at
the
galleon
which
now
towered
above
them
round
shot
and
run
them
out
fast
as
you
can
aye
sir
an
no
more
close
quarters
if
you
please
want
to
be
this
close
to
one
o
the
bastards
again
malloyre
started
to
retreat
through
the
hatch
but
then
he
turned
paused
for
a
second
and
yelled
at
hawksworth
beggin
your
pardon
i
knew
all
along
was
best
to
pull
alongside
and
lay
wi
crossbar
just
wanted
to
give
the
lads
a
bit
o
a
scare
keep
jumpin
hawksworth
waved
his
hand
and
watched
as
malloyre
pudgy
frame
dropped
through
the
hatch
like
a
rabbit
diving
for
its
warren
mackintosh
was
standing
on
the
main
deck
his
tangled
red
mane
blackened
with
smoke
watching
as
the
slowly
toward
the
side
of
the
bobbing
galleon
then
when
they
were
only
feet
away
he
signaled
the
bosun
and
a
line
of
english
seamen
lit
the
waiting
fuses
and
began
to
loft
clay
powder
pots
across
the
waist
of
the
now
almost
above
their
heads
when
they
had
finished
he
passed
orders
and
the
to
pull
away
before
her
sails
could
ignite
then
one
by
one
the
powder
pots
started
to
explode
spewing
burning
sulphur
over
the
portuguese
vessel
decks
hawksworth
watched
the
carnage
and
asked
himself
if
he
had
been
right
to
do
what
he
done
they
have
sunk
us
cut
down
the
men
and
taken
the
officers
and
merchants
to
a
goa
prison
and
then
what
we
have
sunk
them
with
cannon
in
a
week
the
only
choice
was
fire
then
he
turned
to
see
the
sebastian
toward
them
her
cannon
were
already
run
out
and
at
any
moment
she
would
start
coming
about
for
a
broadside
again
he
felt
the
throb
in
his
thigh
and
it
triggered
a
wave
of
fear
that
swept
upward
from
his
stomach
the
indian
pilot
stood
next
to
him
also
watching
the
approaching
galleon
i
have
seen
a
miracle
captain
allah
the
compassionate
has
watched
over
you
today
the
pilot
face
showed
none
of
the
strain
of
battle
and
his
clothes
were
still
spotless
oddly
immune
from
the
oily
smoke
that
blackened
all
the
english
seamen
but
i
fear
there
can
not
be
two
miracles
on
the
same
morning
you
are
about
to
pay
for
your
fortune
perhaps
there
is
still
time
to
strike
your
colors
and
save
the
lives
of
your
men
we
surrender
now
and
we
rot
in
a
goa
prison
forever
or
be
pulled
apart
on
the
hawksworth
glared
back
and
i
seem
to
recall
the
quran
says
not
falter
when
you
gained
the
upper
hand
you
do
not
have
the
upper
hand
my
captain
and
the
holy
quran
speaks
only
of
those
who
trust
in
allah
the
merciful
his
voice
trailed
off
as
he
turned
to
stare
at
hawksworth
it
is
not
common
for
a
to
know
the
holy
quran
how
is
it
you
i
just
spent
two
years
in
a
turkish
prison
and
i
heard
little
else
hawksworth
turned
and
was
testing
the
wind
weighing
his
options
the
sebastian
almost
on
them
her
cannon
were
already
run
out
and
at
any
moment
she
would
start
coming
about
for
a
broadside
he
could
still
hear
the
trucks
of
the
cannon
below
decks
as
the
starboard
battery
was
being
run
out
and
he
knew
the
portside
crews
were
only
now
beginning
to
swab
the
last
glowing
shreds
of
metal
from
the
cannon
barrels
good
god
there
no
time
to
set
the
ordnance
they
blow
us
to
hell
he
deliberated
for
a
long
moment
weighing
his
options
as
he
watched
the
sebastian
to
shorten
sail
preparing
to
come
about
and
fire
only
minutes
remained
then
he
noticed
that
the
wind
on
the
burning
ventura
was
drifting
her
in
the
direction
of
the
approaching
and
he
hit
on
another
gamble
they
shortened
sail
in
order
to
come
about
which
means
they
vulnerable
now
if
i
can
make
them
try
to
take
their
bow
across
the
wind
with
their
sails
shortened
mackintosh
take
her
hard
about
set
the
courses
for
a
port
tack
once
again
the
heeled
in
the
water
her
stern
deftly
crossing
the
wind
and
then
she
was
back
under
full
sail
still
to
windward
of
the
burning
galleon
the
sudden
tack
had
left
the
burning
ventura
between
the
english
frigate
and
the
approaching
galleon
the
away
keeping
the
wind
forcing
the
galleon
to
tack
also
if
she
would
engage
them
hawksworth
watched
holding
his
breath
as
portuguese
seamen
began
to
man
the
sheets
bringing
the
sebastian
into
the
wind
it
was
fatal
the
approaching
galleon
had
shortened
too
much
sail
in
preparation
to
come
about
for
the
broadside
and
now
she
lacked
the
momentum
to
cross
the
wind
instead
the
sluggish
warship
hung
in
stays
her
sails
slack
her
bulky
bow
fighting
the
wind
refusing
to
pay
off
onto
the
opposite
tack
all
the
while
the
was
drifting
inexorably
toward
her
flaming
i
was
right
hawksworth
thought
she
did
have
the
speed
to
bring
her
bow
around
with
his
glass
he
watched
the
galleon
captain
order
her
back
to
the
original
tack
but
time
had
run
out
blinding
explosions
suddenly
illuminated
the
gunports
of
the
burning
as
powder
barrels
on
the
gun
decks
ignited
first
the
upper
and
then
the
lower
in
only
moments
the
fire
found
the
powder
room
aft
of
the
orlop
deck
and
as
the
english
seamen
looked
on
spellbound
the
galleon
seemed
to
erupt
in
a
single
cloud
of
fire
rocketing
burning
timbers
and
spars
across
the
sea
surface
the
mainmast
flaming
like
a
giant
taper
snapped
and
heaved
slowly
into
the
then
the
superstructure
on
the
stern
folded
and
dropped
through
the
main
deck
throwing
a
plume
of
sparks
high
into
the
morning
air
although
the
sebastian
righted
herself
she
still
had
not
regained
speed
for
now
the
sails
had
lost
their
luff
and
sagged
to
leeward
why
is
she
underway
hawksworth
asked
himself
surely
she
circle
and
engage
us
he
looked
again
with
the
glass
and
the
reason
became
clear
the
portuguese
crewmen
on
the
had
begun
throwing
themselves
into
the
sea
terrified
at
the
sight
of
the
ventura
hull
drifting
slowly
across
their
bow
the
wind
had
freshened
again
and
was
pushing
the
burning
galleon
rapidly
now
the
blaze
had
become
an
inferno
fueled
by
casks
of
coconut
oil
stored
below
decks
on
the
galleon
and
hawksworth
involuntarily
shielded
his
eyes
and
face
from
the
heat
that
even
at
their
distance
seared
the
as
he
watched
the
drifting
ventura
lurched
crazily
sideways
and
then
came
the
sound
of
a
coarse
grinding
impact
as
her
burning
timbers
sprayed
across
the
decks
of
the
in
moments
the
second
galleon
was
also
an
abandoned
inferno
her
crew
long
since
afloat
in
the
safety
of
the
sea
clinging
to
debris
and
making
for
shore
allah
has
been
merciful
twice
to
you
in
one
morning
captain
i
had
never
before
known
the
extent
of
his
bounty
you
are
a
man
most
fortunate
the
pilot
words
spoken
softly
and
with
pronounced
gravity
were
almost
drowned
in
the
cheers
that
engulfed
the
decks
and
rigging
of
the
the
battle
just
begun
boarding
parties
are
at
the
and
there
are
two
more
galleons
hawksworth
reached
for
the
glass
by
the
binnacle
no
captain
i
doubt
very
much
the
portuguese
will
trouble
you
further
your
luck
has
been
too
exceptional
but
they
will
return
another
day
the
pilot
squinted
toward
the
shore
as
though
confirming
something
he
knew
should
be
there
hawksworth
trained
his
glass
on
the
two
galleons
that
still
held
the
pinned
in
the
shallows
they
were
heeling
about
preparing
to
run
southward
on
the
wind
under
full
press
of
sail
he
also
realized
their
longboats
had
been
abandoned
some
were
following
futilely
after
the
retreating
galleons
while
others
were
already
rowing
toward
the
river
mouth
the
english
frigate
had
been
forgotten
then
he
noted
that
although
pennants
no
longer
flew
from
the
yardarms
of
the
galleons
the
large
unnamed
vessel
had
run
out
a
brilliant
red
ensign
on
her
poop
staff
he
studied
it
carefully
then
turned
to
the
pilot
extending
the
glass
take
a
look
and
tell
me
what
the
colors
are
on
the
large
i
never
seen
them
before
the
pilot
waved
away
the
telescope
with
a
smile
i
need
no
christian
device
to
tell
you
that
we
all
know
it
with
all
your
fortune
you
have
failed
to
understand
the
most
important
thing
that
happened
today
and
what
is
that
those
are
the
colors
of
the
viceroy
of
goa
flown
only
when
he
is
aboard
his
flagship
you
have
humiliated
him
today
the
colors
speak
his
defiance
his
promise
to
you
as
the
pilot
spoke
mackintosh
came
bounding
up
the
companionway
to
the
quarterdeck
his
face
beaming
what
a
bleedin
day
bleedin
day
then
his
eyes
dimmed
for
an
instant
but
a
man
be
called
a
liar
who
told
the
story
how
many
dead
and
wounded
mackintosh
two
maintopmen
killed
by
musket
fire
and
a
bosun
mate
took
a
splinter
in
the
side
very
bad
when
the
bastards
laid
us
wi
the
first
bowchasers
a
few
other
lads
took
musket
fire
but
the
surgeon
sew
up
fine
then
break
out
the
last
keg
of
brandy
and
see
that
malloyre
men
get
the
first
tot
but
do
forget
to
send
a
tankard
to
the
quarterdeck
mackintosh
broke
an
appreciative
grin
and
headed
down
the
companionway
ladder
the
sun
was
baking
the
decks
now
and
a
swarm
of
locusts
had
appeared
from
nowhere
to
buzz
about
the
maintop
the
wind
was
beginning
to
slacken
in
the
heat
and
silence
slowly
settled
over
the
hawksworth
turned
his
glass
one
last
time
to
the
large
galleon
he
could
still
make
out
the
ensign
over
the
crests
of
surf
blood
red
in
the
sun
chapter
three
the
bells
sounded
ending
the
afternoon
watch
and
calling
the
first
dog
watch
only
four
hours
since
noon
but
already
the
morning
carnage
seemed
a
memory
from
a
distant
lifetime
sultry
tropic
air
motionless
and
stifling
immersed
the
as
the
seamen
labored
to
finish
securing
the
mast
of
the
pinnace
mackintosh
had
ordered
the
pinnace
sail
unrolled
on
deck
and
as
he
inspected
the
stitches
for
rot
he
alternately
reviled
the
men
the
heat
the
company
hawksworth
had
completed
the
log
and
stood
in
the
companionway
outside
the
great
cabin
to
watch
the
preparations
take
the
air
and
exercise
his
leg
all
the
previous
night
he
had
stood
on
the
quarterdeck
keeping
the
helm
and
translating
for
the
pilot
and
tonight
again
there
would
be
no
sleep
there
time
for
a
rest
now
his
weary
mind
urged
till
the
first
bell
of
this
watch
half
an
hour
then
he
cursed
himself
for
his
weakness
his
readiness
to
yield
and
shoved
open
the
door
of
the
great
cabin
the
oil
lamp
swayed
with
each
roll
of
the
ship
punctuating
the
rhythmic
creak
of
the
wood
paneling
and
adding
to
the
sweltering
heat
he
locked
the
door
then
strode
aft
to
push
ajar
the
two
stern
windows
but
the
stolid
air
lay
inert
refusing
to
lift
he
would
have
to
prepare
the
chest
in
suffocating
misery
so
be
it
brushing
the
hair
back
from
his
eyes
he
unlocked
a
bronzed
sea
chest
and
began
to
extract
one
by
one
the
articles
entrusted
to
the
company
by
king
james
first
was
the
letter
in
english
with
a
formal
copy
in
diplomatic
spanish
both
scribed
on
parchment
and
sealed
in
a
leather
case
secured
with
his
majesty
impression
in
red
wax
the
seal
set
in
london
over
seven
months
before
was
soft
in
the
heat
now
pliant
to
his
touch
he
surveyed
the
room
for
a
moment
and
then
his
eye
hit
on
the
pair
of
formal
length
stockings
the
company
had
insisted
he
pack
perfect
he
bound
his
hose
around
the
king
letter
knotted
it
protectively
over
the
seal
and
tossed
the
bundle
into
the
smaller
wooden
chest
he
would
take
ashore
then
he
began
to
transfer
the
royal
presents
a
brace
of
pistols
a
half
dozen
swords
a
small
saddle
a
set
of
delicate
norwich
crystal
jeweled
rings
a
bound
mirror
a
silver
whistle
studded
with
emeralds
a
large
cocked
hat
trimmed
in
silk
a
miniature
portrait
of
king
james
and
finally
a
dozen
bottles
of
fine
english
sack
he
checked
each
item
for
damage
and
then
packed
them
tightly
into
the
small
chest
finally
he
inserted
a
tightly
fitting
false
bottom
and
covered
it
with
a
coarse
woolen
rug
then
the
second
packing
began
he
started
with
more
gifts
these
for
port
officials
mainly
knives
and
rings
set
with
small
inexpensive
pearls
he
also
enclosed
several
boxed
sets
of
english
gold
sovereigns
which
the
company
had
requested
be
distributed
as
widely
as
possible
in
hopes
they
would
begin
to
be
accepted
finally
he
looked
about
the
room
for
personal
goods
first
he
folded
in
a
new
leather
jerkin
then
next
to
it
packed
a
new
pair
of
leather
boots
he
stared
at
the
boots
for
a
moment
and
then
removed
them
while
he
carefully
wrapped
two
primed
pistols
and
slid
one
deep
into
each
hollow
toe
next
to
the
boots
he
packed
a
case
of
spanish
brandy
he
had
been
saving
for
personal
use
aland
lastly
he
took
his
glistening
english
lute
from
its
corner
berth
held
it
for
a
moment
and
tested
the
strings
he
adjusted
the
tuning
on
one
string
then
wrapped
the
lute
body
in
a
silk
cloth
and
nestled
it
next
to
the
brandy
as
he
secured
the
lock
on
the
chest
and
pocketed
the
large
brass
key
he
suddenly
asked
himself
how
he
would
get
the
chest
into
india
without
its
being
searched
i
not
a
genuine
ambassador
i
the
captain
of
a
merchantman
with
no
diplomatic
standing
the
company
for
all
its
mercantile
wisdom
neglected
to
consider
that
small
difficulty
so
i
just
have
to
sound
like
an
ambassador
that
should
be
so
hard
just
be
impressed
with
your
own
importance
and
find
nothing
food
or
lodgings
sufficiently
extravagant
then
he
drew
himself
erect
and
unlocked
the
door
of
the
great
cabin
only
one
thing
remained
mackintosh
the
quartermaster
was
in
the
pinnace
now
fitting
the
tiller
and
he
glanced
up
in
irritation
send
the
pilot
to
my
cabin
hawksworth
had
scarcely
seated
himself
behind
the
great
oak
table
before
the
tall
man
appeared
in
the
doorway
hawksworth
examined
the
face
again
expressionless
and
secure
asking
himself
its
years
is
he
thirty
is
he
fifty
the
features
seemed
cast
from
an
ageless
mold
hard
and
seamless
immune
to
time
may
i
be
of
service
repeat
your
name
for
me
hawksworth
spoke
in
turkish
and
tell
me
again
the
business
of
your
vessel
my
name
is
karim
hasan
ali
the
reply
came
smoothly
but
almost
too
rapidly
for
hawksworth
to
follow
my
ship
was
the
rahimi
a
pilgrim
vessel
on
her
return
voyage
from
mecca
by
way
of
aden
to
our
northern
port
of
diu
we
carry
muslim
pilgrims
outbound
from
india
in
the
spring
and
return
after
the
monsoon
as
you
assuredly
must
know
for
a
thousand
years
mecca
has
been
the
shrine
all
followers
of
islam
must
visit
once
in
their
life
our
cabins
are
always
full
hawksworth
recalled
the
vessel
and
his
astonishment
at
her
size
she
had
had
five
masts
and
was
easily
twelve
hundred
tons
over
twice
the
burden
of
the
and
greater
than
anything
he
had
ever
seen
before
even
the
most
ambitious
spanish
carrack
but
when
they
spotted
her
tacking
eastward
across
the
bay
of
cambay
she
was
unarmed
and
hove
to
almost
before
they
had
fired
across
her
bow
why
unarmed
he
had
asked
himself
then
and
why
strike
so
readily
now
he
understood
and
you
were
the
pilot
for
the
i
am
called
the
a
note
of
formality
entered
the
voice
and
he
instinctively
drew
himself
more
erect
is
that
the
pilot
yes
but
more
perhaps
it
is
like
your
first
mate
but
i
am
in
full
charge
of
navigation
for
the
the
owner
to
you
he
would
be
captain
and
what
was
your
salary
for
the
voyage
i
received
two
hundred
rupees
for
the
trip
to
aden
and
am
allowed
two
extra
cabins
of
goods
for
personal
trade
hawksworth
smiled
resignedly
to
himself
remembering
he
had
unquestioningly
delivered
to
the
bag
of
spanish
rials
of
eight
equivalent
to
five
hundred
indian
rupees
to
buy
out
the
contract
then
he
spoke
tonight
we
go
upriver
to
surat
you
still
in
my
service
and
be
pilot
i
had
expected
it
i
know
the
river
well
will
there
be
any
portugal
traders
on
the
river
hawksworth
searched
his
eyes
hoping
to
monitor
their
truthfulness
i
would
not
expect
it
although
this
year
monsoons
are
past
and
the
river
has
returned
to
normal
there
are
new
sandbanks
every
season
they
shift
becoming
more
treacherous
only
those
of
us
who
know
the
river
well
understand
the
moods
of
her
sands
i
have
never
seen
in
surat
this
early
in
the
season
karim
paused
following
hawksworth
puzzled
expression
then
continued
with
an
air
of
condescension
our
word
meaning
who
wear
hats
we
call
christian
traders
he
fixed
hawksworth
squarely
and
we
have
other
names
for
their
priests
call
christians
what
you
will
but
just
remember
england
is
not
portugal
hawksworth
tone
stiffened
england
has
rid
herself
of
the
popery
that
still
rules
the
spaniards
and
portugals
along
with
their
jesuits
and
their
damned
inquisition
it
now
treason
to
practice
catholic
rites
in
england
i
have
heard
something
of
your
petty
european
squabbles
your
christian
rivalries
is
it
your
intention
now
to
spread
them
to
india
as
well
all
england
wants
is
trade
nothing
else
hawksworth
shifted
his
leg
leaning
forward
to
tighten
the
bandage
i
here
as
an
ambassador
to
convey
the
friendship
of
my
king
and
his
offer
of
free
and
open
trade
and
after
you
begin
this
trade
what
then
will
you
next
try
to
drive
the
portuguese
from
our
ports
so
that
you
can
steal
away
shipping
from
our
own
merchantmen
as
they
have
done
and
demand
we
pay
you
for
a
license
to
ply
our
own
seas
i
told
you
we
only
want
trade
england
has
no
use
for
sailing
licenses
or
priests
our
only
enemies
here
are
the
portugals
and
the
damned
hollanders
if
they
start
trying
to
interfere
karim
studied
hawksworth
in
silence
fingering
his
jeweled
earring
in
thought
as
he
recalled
the
morning
battle
two
small
english
merchant
frigates
had
prevailed
over
four
portuguese
warships
galleons
never
before
he
told
himself
have
the
portuguese
been
humiliated
before
our
eyes
pigeons
must
already
be
winging
word
of
this
incredible
encounter
to
agra
separately
no
doubt
to
the
moghul
and
to
the
queen
but
queen
janahara
will
know
first
as
always
and
she
will
know
her
portuguese
profits
are
no
longer
secure
and
what
about
prince
jadar
yes
the
prince
will
already
have
heard
hours
ago
what
will
prince
jadar
decide
to
do
that
the
most
important
question
now
just
tell
me
about
the
navigation
of
the
river
hawksworth
continued
unable
to
decipher
karim
distant
expression
how
long
will
it
take
for
our
pinnace
to
reach
surat
we
cast
off
at
sunset
the
tide
will
be
running
in
tonight
and
that
will
aid
your
oarsmen
karim
instantly
became
businesslike
there
will
also
be
a
night
breeze
off
the
sea
but
the
portuguese
have
no
authority
on
our
river
once
you
are
inland
you
are
under
the
rule
of
the
governor
of
surat
and
of
course
prince
jadar
whom
the
moghul
has
appointed
to
administrate
this
province
hawksworth
heard
the
first
bell
and
walked
to
the
stern
windows
to
monitor
the
slant
of
the
dying
sun
and
to
inhale
the
fresh
evening
air
then
he
wheeled
and
examined
karim
the
pilot
face
shadowed
in
the
half
light
and
who
are
these
officials
this
governor
and
prince
karim
smiled
and
carefully
secured
the
fold
of
his
turban
the
governor
administers
the
port
of
surat
he
collects
trading
duties
of
the
moghul
court
in
agra
prince
jadar
is
the
son
of
the
moghul
and
the
military
ruler
of
gujarat
this
province
then
who
will
i
meet
in
surat
hawksworth
groped
for
a
pattern
the
governor
or
the
prince
again
karim
paused
wondering
how
much
to
tell
before
continuing
evenly
neither
of
these
need
concern
you
now
the
first
official
you
must
satisfy
will
be
the
shahbandar
what
the
moghuls
call
the
the
shahbandar
controls
the
customs
house
the
portal
for
all
who
would
enter
the
moghul
domain
his
power
over
the
port
is
absolute
hawksworth
slapped
one
of
the
bronze
cannon
to
punctuate
his
dismay
in
india
also
good
jesus
every
muslin
port
in
the
world
must
have
this
same
petty
official
i
heard
that
shahbandar
is
persian
for
lord
of
the
haven
and
if
that
true
the
office
is
named
perfectly
every
one
i
known
has
had
the
right
to
refuse
entry
to
anyone
at
his
whim
if
bribes
are
insufficient
and
no
more
powerful
official
intervenes
who
does
the
shahbandar
here
answer
to
the
governor
the
prince
the
moghul
himself
or
somebody
have
told
me
about
yet
hawksworth
tried
to
push
back
his
rising
anxiety
captain
you
have
in
your
guileless
raised
a
question
it
is
wiser
not
to
pursue
i
can
only
assure
you
the
shahbandar
is
a
man
of
importance
in
surat
and
in
india
but
who
should
i
seek
out
when
we
reach
surat
at
that
moment
two
bells
sounded
on
the
quarterdeck
and
with
them
a
ray
from
the
fading
sun
pierced
the
stern
window
glancing
off
the
oak
boards
of
the
table
a
twilight
silence
seemed
to
settle
uneasily
over
the
amplifying
the
creaking
of
her
boards
captain
i
have
already
told
you
more
than
most
foreigners
know
you
would
be
wise
to
prepare
now
to
meet
the
shahbandar
karim
rose
abruptly
and
bowed
palms
together
hands
at
his
brow
you
must
forgive
me
in
islam
we
pray
at
sunset
hawksworth
stared
after
him
in
perplexity
as
karim
turned
and
vanished
into
the
darkened
companionway
not
yet
even
aland
and
already
i
sense
trouble
he
fears
the
shahbandar
that
clear
enough
but
i
not
sure
it
for
the
usual
reasons
is
there
some
intrigue
underway
that
we
about
to
be
drawn
into
god
help
us
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
fighting
the
ache
in
his
leg
made
his
way
out
to
the
quarter
gallery
on
the
stern
a
lone
flying
fish
marooned
in
the
bay
from
its
home
in
the
open
sea
burst
from
the
almost
placid
waters
glinting
the
orange
sun
off
its
body
and
settling
with
a
splash
annoying
the
seabirds
that
squabbled
over
gallery
scraps
along
the
port
side
seamen
carrying
rations
of
salt
pork
and
biscuit
were
clambering
down
the
companionway
and
through
the
hatch
leading
to
the
lower
deck
and
their
hammocks
hawksworth
listened
to
them
curse
the
close
humid
air
below
and
then
he
turned
to
inhale
again
the
land
breeze
permeated
with
a
green
perfume
of
almost
palpable
intensity
following
the
direction
of
the
sweetened
air
he
turned
and
examined
the
darkening
shore
one
last
time
india
now
seemed
vaguely
obscured
as
through
a
light
mist
or
was
it
merely
encroaching
darkness
and
through
this
veil
the
land
seemed
somehow
to
brood
or
did
it
beckon
it
my
imagination
he
told
himself
india
is
there
all
right
solid
ground
and
scarcely
a
cannon
shot
away
india
the
place
of
fable
and
mystery
to
englishmen
for
centuries
and
also
the
place
where
a
certain
party
of
english
travelers
disappeared
so
many
years
ago
that
should
have
been
a
warning
he
told
himself
it
almost
too
ironic
that
you
the
next
man
to
try
to
go
in
you
of
all
the
men
in
england
are
you
destined
to
repeat
their
tragedy
he
recalled
again
the
story
he
knew
all
too
well
the
man
financing
those
english
travelers
almost
three
decades
past
had
been
none
other
than
peter
elkington
father
of
george
elkington
chief
merchant
on
this
voyage
like
his
son
peter
elkington
was
a
swearing
drinking
whoring
merchant
a
giant
of
a
man
who
many
people
claimed
looked
more
and
more
like
king
harry
the
older
and
fatter
he
got
it
was
peter
elkington
original
idea
those
many
years
back
to
send
englishmen
to
india
the
time
was
before
england
met
and
obliterated
the
armada
of
spain
and
long
before
she
could
hope
to
challenge
the
oceanic
trade
networks
of
the
catholic
countries
spain
to
the
new
world
portugal
to
the
east
in
those
days
the
only
possible
road
to
india
for
england
and
the
rest
of
europe
still
was
overland
the
caravan
trail
that
long
preceded
portugal
secret
new
sea
route
around
the
cape
the
idea
of
an
english
mission
overland
to
india
had
grown
out
of
peter
elkington
levant
company
franchised
by
queen
elizabeth
to
exploit
her
new
treaty
with
the
ottoman
turks
controllers
of
the
caravan
trade
between
india
and
the
mediterranean
through
the
levant
company
english
traders
could
at
last
buy
spices
directly
at
tripoli
from
overland
caravans
traveling
the
persian
gulf
and
across
arabia
thereby
circumventing
the
greedy
venetian
brokers
who
for
centuries
had
served
as
middlemen
for
europe
pepper
and
spices
but
peter
elkington
wanted
more
why
buy
expensive
spices
at
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
why
not
extend
england
own
trade
lines
all
the
way
to
india
and
buy
directly
to
gain
intelligence
for
this
daring
trade
expansion
he
decided
to
finance
a
secret
expedition
to
scout
the
road
to
india
to
send
a
party
of
english
traders
through
the
mediterranean
to
tripoli
and
on
from
there
in
disguise
across
arabia
to
the
persian
gulf
where
they
would
hire
passage
on
a
native
trader
all
the
way
to
the
western
shore
of
india
their
ultimate
destination
was
the
great
moghufs
court
deep
in
india
and
hidden
in
their
bags
would
be
a
letter
from
queen
elizabeth
proposing
direct
trade
eventually
three
adventurous
traders
were
recruited
to
go
led
by
roger
symmes
of
the
levant
company
but
peter
elkington
wanted
a
fourth
for
protection
and
he
eventually
persuaded
a
young
army
captain
of
some
reputation
to
join
the
party
the
captain
originally
a
painter
who
had
later
turned
soldier
after
the
death
of
his
wife
was
vigorous
spirited
and
a
deadly
marksman
peter
elkington
promised
him
a
nobleman
fortune
if
they
succeeded
and
he
promised
to
take
responsibility
for
captain
hawksworth
son
brian
if
they
failed
peter
elkington
himself
came
down
to
the
thames
that
cold
gray
february
dawn
they
set
sail
bringing
along
his
own
son
george
a
pudgy
pampered
adolescent
in
a
silk
doublet
young
george
elkington
regally
ignored
brian
hawksworth
a
snub
only
one
of
the
two
still
remembered
as
the
sails
slowly
dissolved
into
the
icy
mist
brian
climbed
atop
his
uncle
shoulders
to
catch
a
long
last
glimpse
no
one
dreamed
that
only
one
of
the
four
would
ever
see
london
again
letters
smuggled
back
in
cipher
kept
the
levant
company
informed
of
progress
the
party
reached
tripoli
without
incident
made
their
way
successfully
overland
through
arabia
and
then
hired
passage
on
an
arab
trader
for
her
trip
down
the
persian
gulf
the
plan
seemed
to
be
working
perfectly
then
came
a
final
letter
from
the
portuguese
fortress
of
hormuz
a
island
peopled
by
traders
overlooking
the
straits
between
the
persian
gulf
and
the
gulf
of
oman
gateway
to
the
arabian
sea
and
india
ports
while
waiting
at
hormuz
for
passage
on
to
india
the
english
party
had
been
betrayed
by
a
suspicious
venetian
and
accused
of
being
spies
the
portuguese
governor
of
hormuz
had
nervously
imprisoned
them
and
decreed
they
be
shipped
to
goa
for
trial
after
waiting
a
few
more
months
for
further
word
peter
elkington
finally
summoned
brian
hawksworth
to
the
offices
of
the
levant
company
and
read
him
this
last
letter
he
then
proceeded
to
curse
the
contract
with
captain
hawksworth
that
rendered
the
levant
company
responsible
for
brian
education
should
the
expedition
meet
disaster
peter
elkington
admitted
his
plan
had
failed
and
with
that
admission
the
levant
company
quietly
abandoned
its
vision
of
direct
trade
with
india
but
brian
hawksworth
now
had
a
private
tutor
engaged
by
the
levant
company
a
young
apostate
recently
dismissed
from
his
post
at
eton
for
his
views
this
new
tutor
scorned
as
dogmatic
the
accepted
subjects
of
latin
rhetoric
and
hebrew
all
intended
to
help
elizabethan
scholars
fathom
abstruse
theological
disputations
and
insisted
instead
on
mathematics
and
the
new
subject
of
science
his
outlook
also
meant
he
would
teach
none
of
the
german
in
fashion
with
the
puritans
or
the
french
and
spanish
favored
by
catholics
for
him
all
that
mattered
was
classical
greek
the
language
of
logic
pure
philosophy
mathematics
and
science
the
end
result
was
that
the
commoner
brian
hawksworth
received
an
education
far
different
from
if
not
better
than
that
of
most
gentlemen
and
one
that
greatly
surpassed
the
hornbook
alphabet
and
numbers
that
passed
for
learning
among
others
of
his
own
class
to
no
one
surprise
brian
hawksworth
was
his
father
son
and
he
took
naturally
to
marksmanship
and
fencing
but
his
first
love
came
to
be
the
english
lute
his
escape
from
the
world
of
his
tutor
hard
numbers
and
theorems
it
lasted
until
the
day
he
was
fourteen
the
day
the
levant
responsibility
expired
the
next
morning
brian
hawksworth
found
himself
apprenticed
to
a
thames
waterman
and
placed
in
service
on
one
of
the
ferryboats
that
plied
london
main
artery
after
three
months
of
misery
and
ill
pay
he
slipped
away
to
take
a
berth
on
a
north
sea
merchantman
there
he
sensed
at
once
his
calling
was
the
sea
and
he
also
discovered
his
knowledge
of
mathematics
gave
him
an
understanding
of
navigation
few
other
seamen
enjoyed
by
then
he
scarcely
remembered
his
father
or
the
luckless
expedition
to
india
until
the
day
roger
symmes
appeared
alone
back
in
london
almost
ten
years
after
that
icy
morning
the
levant
company
expedition
had
sailed
the
and
hawksworth
sensed
the
wind
freshen
as
it
whipped
through
the
stern
quarter
gallery
and
noticed
the
increasingly
brisk
swirl
of
the
tide
almost
time
to
cast
off
as
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
great
cabin
for
a
last
check
his
thoughts
returned
again
to
london
those
many
years
ago
he
had
found
symmes
at
the
offices
of
the
levant
company
nursing
a
tankard
of
ale
as
he
sat
very
close
to
their
large
roaring
fireplace
he
bore
little
resemblance
to
the
jaunty
adventurer
hawksworth
remembered
from
that
morning
on
the
thames
now
he
was
an
incongruous
figure
costumed
in
a
new
silk
doublet
and
wearing
several
large
gold
rings
yet
with
a
face
that
was
haggard
beyond
anything
hawksworth
had
ever
seen
his
vacant
eyes
seemed
unable
to
focus
as
he
glanced
up
briefly
and
then
returned
his
stare
to
the
crackling
logs
in
the
hearth
but
he
needed
no
prompting
to
begin
his
story
aye
is
a
tale
to
make
the
blood
run
ice
symmes
eased
open
a
button
of
his
ornate
doublet
and
shakily
loosened
his
new
ruff
collar
after
the
venetian
rogue
gets
us
arrest
with
his
damnable
lie
the
bastard
portugals
clap
us
in
the
hold
of
a
coastin
barge
makin
for
goa
in
company
with
near
a
hundred
arab
horses
when
we
finally
make
port
they
haul
us
out
of
that
stink
hole
and
slam
us
in
another
this
time
the
viceroy
dungeons
we
took
ourselves
for
dead
men
but
what
happened
to
my
father
hawksworth
blinked
the
sweat
from
his
eyes
wanting
the
story
but
wanting
almost
more
to
escape
the
overheated
timbered
offices
that
loomed
so
alien
that
the
horrible
part
o
the
story
it
happen
the
next
mornin
poor
luckless
bastard
we
all
march
into
this
big
room
where
they
keep
the
what
that
tis
a
kindly
little
invention
o
the
portugals
lad
first
they
bind
your
hands
behind
your
back
and
run
the
rope
up
over
a
hangin
pulley
block
then
they
hoist
you
up
in
the
air
and
set
to
givin
it
little
tugs
makin
you
hop
like
you
dancin
the
french
lavolta
when
they
tire
o
the
sport
or
they
due
to
go
say
their
rosary
beads
they
just
give
it
a
good
strong
heave
and
pop
your
arms
out
o
your
shoulders
jesuits
claim
make
a
moor
pray
to
the
pope
hawksworth
found
himself
watching
symmes
wild
eyes
as
he
recounted
the
story
and
wondering
how
he
could
remember
every
detail
of
events
a
decade
past
then
this
young
captain
comes
in
struttin
bastard
hardly
a
good
twenty
year
on
him
later
i
made
a
point
to
learn
his
name
vaijantes
miguel
vaijantes
what
did
he
do
had
to
see
him
lad
eyes
black
and
hard
as
onyx
an
he
sports
this
sword
he
had
made
up
with
rubies
in
the
handle
saw
the
likes
o
it
before
or
since
in
india
but
he
a
portugal
tho
through
an
through
no
doubt
on
that
one
but
what
did
he
do
why
he
has
the
guards
sling
hawksworth
up
in
the
lad
seein
he
the
strongest
one
o
us
figur
he
last
longer
i
suppose
make
more
sport
vaijantes
had
them
torture
my
father
aye
think
he
squeeze
a
confession
and
be
a
hero
but
hawksworth
said
a
word
all
day
by
nightfall
vaijantes
has
pull
his
arms
right
out
they
carried
him
out
of
the
room
a
dead
man
hawksworth
still
remembered
how
his
stomach
turned
at
that
moment
with
the
final
knowledge
that
his
father
was
not
merely
missing
or
away
as
he
had
told
himself
and
others
but
had
been
coldly
murdered
he
had
checked
his
tears
lest
symmes
see
and
pressed
on
what
happened
to
you
and
to
the
others
did
he
torture
you
next
would
have
not
a
doubt
o
we
all
wonder
who
be
the
next
one
then
that
night
they
post
a
jesuit
down
to
our
cell
a
turncoat
dutchman
by
the
name
of
huyghen
who
spoke
perfect
english
he
cozen
us
into
confessin
but
he
hates
the
portugals
we
do
an
he
tells
us
we
most
likely
go
free
if
we
pretend
to
turn
papist
so
the
next
day
we
blurt
out
we
actually
a
band
o
wealthy
adventurers
in
disguise
rich
lads
out
to
taste
the
world
but
seen
the
error
o
our
ways
an
we
decided
to
foreswear
the
flesh
and
turn
jesuits
ourselves
thinkin
of
donatin
everything
we
own
to
their
holy
order
symmes
paused
and
nervously
drew
a
small
sip
from
his
tankard
of
spiced
ale
vicious
papist
bastards
did
they
really
believe
you
guess
the
dutchman
must
convinc
somehow
anyway
our
story
look
square
enough
to
get
us
out
on
bail
there
bein
no
evidence
for
the
charge
o
spyin
in
any
case
but
we
hardly
took
a
breath
of
air
before
our
old
friend
the
hollander
comes
runnin
with
news
the
viceroy
council
just
voted
to
ship
us
back
to
lisbon
for
trial
that
happens
and
we
dead
men
no
question
we
had
to
look
to
it
symmes
seemed
to
find
concentration
increasingly
difficult
but
he
extracted
a
pipe
and
began
stuffing
black
strands
into
it
with
a
trembling
hand
while
he
composed
himself
finally
he
continued
had
to
leave
goa
that
very
night
what
else
could
we
do
so
we
traded
what
little
we
had
for
diamonds
sew
up
in
our
clothes
and
waded
the
river
into
india
by
dawn
we
beyond
reach
o
the
portugals
in
india
an
then
lad
is
when
it
began
what
happened
take
a
year
to
tell
it
all
somehow
we
eventually
got
to
the
great
moghul
court
i
think
he
was
named
akman
an
we
start
like
i
never
thought
i
see
should
seen
his
city
lad
made
london
look
like
a
shropshire
village
he
had
a
big
red
marble
palace
called
fatehpur
sekri
with
jewels
common
as
rocks
an
gold
gardens
filled
with
fountains
an
mystical
music
like
i
heard
an
dancin
women
that
look
like
angels
his
voice
trailed
off
ah
lad
the
women
there
symmes
suddenly
remembered
himself
and
turned
to
examine
hawksworth
with
his
glassy
eyes
but
i
fancy
you
a
bit
young
to
appreciate
that
part
o
it
lad
then
his
gaze
returned
to
the
fire
and
he
rambled
on
warming
to
his
own
voice
an
there
was
poets
persian
and
painters
drawin
pictures
that
took
days
to
do
one
the
size
of
a
book
page
an
the
banquets
feasts
you
like
to
see
this
side
o
judgment
day
symmes
paused
to
draw
on
his
pipe
for
a
moment
his
hand
still
shaking
and
then
he
plunged
ahead
but
it
was
the
drugs
that
did
it
lad
what
they
call
affion
and
bhang
made
out
o
poppy
flowers
and
some
kind
of
hemp
take
enough
of
them
and
the
world
around
you
starts
to
get
lost
after
a
while
you
want
to
come
back
it
kill
the
others
lad
god
only
knows
how
i
escap
then
symmes
took
up
his
monologue
about
the
wealth
witnessed
stories
of
potential
trade
that
had
earned
him
a
place
at
many
a
merchant
table
his
tale
expanded
becoming
ever
more
fantastic
until
it
was
impossible
to
tell
where
fact
ended
and
wishful
fabrication
began
although
symmes
had
never
actually
met
any
indian
officials
and
though
the
letter
from
queen
elizabeth
had
been
lost
en
route
his
astonishing
story
of
india
riches
inspired
the
greed
of
all
england
merchants
excitement
swelled
throughout
london
cheapside
as
traders
began
to
clamor
for
england
to
challenge
portugal
monopoly
of
the
sea
passage
around
the
cape
symmes
by
his
inflated
account
had
unwittingly
sown
the
first
seeds
of
the
east
india
company
only
young
brian
hawksworth
who
nourished
no
mercantile
fantasies
seemed
to
realize
that
roger
symmes
had
returned
from
india
quite
completely
mad
chapter

pinnace

i
thinkin
we
should
stow
the

and
be
underway
if
we
goin
mackintosh
silhouette
was
framed
in
the
doorway
of
the
great
cabin
his
eyes
gaunt
in
the
lantern
light
dark
had
dropped
suddenly
over
the
bringing
with
it
a
cooling
respite
from
the
inferno
of
day
we
cast
off
before
the
watch
is
out
start
loading
the
cloth
and
hawksworth
turned
and
pointed
toward
his
own
locked
sea
chest
and
send
for
the
purser
mackintosh
backed
through
the
doorway
and
turned
automatically
to
leave
but
then
he
paused
his
body
suspended
in
uncertainty
for
a
long
moment
finally
he
revolved
again
to
hawksworth
have
to
tell
you
i
a
feelin
we
na
be
sailin
out
o
this
hole
alive
he
squinted
across
the
of
the
cabin
it
my
nose
tellin
me
sir
and
she
always
right
the
company
sailed
to
the
indies
twice
before
mackintosh
aye
but
na
to
india
the
bleedin
company
dropped
anchor
in
this
nest
o
portugals
was
down
to
java
before
with
nothin
but
a
few
dutchmen
to
trouble
india
na
the
indies
the
indies
is
down
in
the
spice
islands
where
seas
are
open
the
ports
o
india
belong
to
the
portugals
sure
as
england
owns
the
straits
o
dover
so
beggin
your
pardon
this
is
na
the
indies
this
might
well
be
lisbon
harbor
we
have
a
secure
anchorage
and
once
we
inland
the
portugals
ca
touch
us
hawksworth
tried
to
hold
a
tone
of
confidence
in
his
voice
the
pilot
says
he
can
take
us
upriver
tonight
under
cover
of
dark
no
christian
can
trust
a
bleedin
moor
an
this
one
got
a
curious
look
somethin
in
his
eyes
ca
tell
if
he
lookin
at
you
or
na
hawksworth
wanted
to
agree
but
he
stopped
himself
moors
just
have
their
own
ways
mackintosh
their
mind
works
differently
but
i
can
already
tell
this
one
not
like
the
turks
hawksworth
still
had
not
decided
what
he
thought
about
the
pilot
it
scarcely
matters
now
he
told
himself
we
no
choice
but
to
trust
him
whatever
he
thinking
he
have
no
room
to
play
us
false
maybe
na
but
he
keeps
lookin
toward
the
shore
like
he
expectin
somethin
the
bastard
na
tellin
us
what
he
knows
i
smell
it
the
nose
we
have
muskets
mackintosh
and
the
cover
of
dark
now
load
the
pinnace
and
let
be
on
with
it
mackintosh
stared
at
the
boards
shifting
and
tightening
his
belt
he
started
to
argue
more
but
hawksworth
voice
stopped
him
and
mackintosh
order
the
muskets
primed
with
pistol
shot
hawksworth
recalled
a
trick
his
father
had
once
told
him
about
many
long
years
past
if
anybody
ventures
to
surprise
us
we
hand
them
a
surprise
in
turn
a
musket
ball
useless
in
the
dark
of
night
clump
of
pistol
shot
at
close
quarters
is
another
story
the
prospect
of
a
fight
seemed
to
transform
mackintosh
with
a
grin
he
snapped
alert
whirled
and
stalked
down
the
companionway
toward
the
main
deck
moments
later
the
balding
purser
appeared
a
lifelong
seaman
with
an
unctuous
smile
and
rapacious
eyes
who
had
dispensed
stores
on
many
a
prosperous
merchantman
and
grown
rich
on
a
career
of
bribes
he
mechanically
logged
hawksworth
chest
in
his
account
book
and
then
signaled
the
bosun
to
stow
the
heavy
wooden
trunk
into
the
pinnace
hawksworth
watched
the
proceedings
absently
as
he
checked
the
edge
on
his
sword
then
he
slipped
the
belt
over
his
shoulder
and
secured
its
large
brass
buckle
finally
he
locked
the
stern
windows
and
surveyed
the
darkened
cabin
one
last
time
the
may
god
defend
her
and
see
us
all
home
safe
every
man
then
without
looking
back
he
firmly
closed
the
heavy
oak
door
latched
it
and
headed
down
the
companionway
toward
the
main
deck
rolls
of
broadcloth
lay
stacked
along
the
waist
of
the
ship
and
beside
them
were
muskets
and
a
keg
of
powder
george
elkington
was
checking
off
samples
of
cloth
as
they
were
loaded
irto
the
pinnace
noting
his
selection

of
accounts
standing

humphrey
spencer
youngest
son
of
sir
randolph
spencer
he
had
shipped
the
voyage
as
the
assistant
to
elkington
but
his
real
motivation
was
not
commerce
but
adventure
and
a
stock
of
tales
to
spin
out
in
taverns
when
he
returned
his
face
of
twenty
had
suffered
little
from
the
voyage
for
a
stream
of
bribes
to
the
knowing
purser
had
reserved
for
him
the
choice
provisions
including
virtually
all
the
honey
and
raisins
humphrey
spencer
had
donned
a
tall
brimmed
hat
a
feather
protruding
from
its
beaver
band
and
his
fresh
doublet
of
green
taffeta
fairly
glowed
in
the
lantern
rays
his
new
hose
were
an
immaculate
tan
and
his
ruff
collar
pure
silk
a
bouquet
of
perfume
hovered
about
him
like
an
invisible
cloud
spencer
turned
and
began
to
pace
the
deck
in
distraught
agitation
oblivious
to
his
interference
as
weary
seamen
worked
around
him
to
drag
rolls
of
broadcloth
next
to
the
gunwales
stacking
them
for
others
to
hoist
and
stow
in
the
pinnace
then
he
spotted
hawksworth
and
his
eyes
brightened
captain
at
last
you
here
your
bosun
is
an
arrant
knave
my
life
o
he
not
have
these
rogues
stow
my
chest
there
no
room
in
the
pinnace
for
your
chest
spencer
but
how
i
to
conduct
affairs
the
moors
without
a
fittings
he
reviewed
hawksworth
leather
jerkin
and
seaboots
with
disdain
before
hawksworth
could
reply
elkington
was
pulling
himself
erect
wincing
at
the
gout
as
his
eyes
blazed
spencer
you
enough
to
do
just
mindin
the
accounts
which
thus
far
you
shown
scant
aptness
for
he
turned
and
spat
into
the
scuppers
your
father
have
me
make
you
a
merchant
but
methinks
i
sooner
school
an
ape
to
sing
is
tradin
we
here
for
not
to
preen
like
a
damn
coxcomb
now
look
to
it
you
accompany
us
spencer
as
is
your
charge
hawksworth
walked
past
the
young
clerk
headed
for
the
the
only
you
need
are
a
sword
and
musket
which
i
dearly
hope
you
know
enough
to
use
now
prepare
to
board
as
hawksworth
passed
the
mainmast
bosun
mate
john
garway
dropped
the
bundle
he
was
holding
and
stepped
forward
beaming
a
toothless
smile
beggin
your
pardon
might
i
be
havin
a
word
what
is
it
garway
would
you
ask
the
heathen
sir
for
the
men
we
been
wonderin
if
there
like
to
be
an
alehouse
or
such
in
this
place
we
goin
an
a
few
o
the
kindly
sex
what
might
be
friendly
disposed
if
you
follow
my
reckonin
sir
hawksworth
looked
up
and
saw
karim
waiting
by
the
his
effects
rolled
in
a
small
woven
tapestry
under
his
arm
when
the
question
was
translated
the
pilot
laid
aside
the
bundle
and
stepped
toward
the
group
of
waiting
seamen
who
had
all
stopped
work
to
listen
he
studied
them
for
a
moment
ragged
and
rank
with
sweat
their
faces
blotched
with
scurvy
and
their
hair
matted
with
grease
and
lice
and
smiled
with
expressionless
eyes
your
men
will
find
they
can
purchase
a
local
liquor
as
potent
as
any
i
have
seen
from
europe
and
the
public
women
of
surat
are
masters
of
all
refinements
of
the
senses
they
are
exquisite
worthy
even
of
the
moghul
himself
accomplished
women
of
pleasure
have
been
brought
here
from
all
civilized
parts
of
the
world
even
egypt
and
persia
i
sure
your
seamen
will
find
the
accommodations
of
surat
worthy
of
their
expectations
hawksworth
translated
the
reply
and
a
cheer
rose
from
the
men
hear
that
mates
master
mate
thomas
davies
turned
to
the
crowd
his
face
a
haggard
leer
let
the
rottin
portugals
swab
cannon
in
hell
i
be
aswim
in
grog
an
snuffin
my
wick
with
a
willin
wench
heathen
or
no
is
all
one
what
say
a
confirming
hurrah
lifted
from
the
decks
and
the
men
resumed
their
labor
with
spirits
noticeably
replenished
hawksworth
turned
and
ascended
the
companionway
ladder
to
the
quarterdeck
leaving
behind
the
tense
bravado
as
he
surveyed
the
deck
below
from
his
new
vantage
he
suddenly
sensed
an
eerie
light
enveloping
the
chip
a
curious
glow
that
seemed
almost
to
heighten
the
pensive
lament
of
the
boards
and
the
lulling
melody
of
wind
through
the
rigging
then
he
realized
why
the
moon
i
forgotten
or
was
i
too
tired
to
think
but
now
it
almost
like
daylight
god
help
us
we
lost
the
last
of
our
luck
ready
to
cast
off
mackintosh
mounted
the
companionway
to
the
quarterdeck
his
face
now
drawn
deep
with
fatigue
shall
i
board
the
men
hawksworth
turned
with
a
nod
and
followed
him
down
to
the
main
deck
oarsmen
began
scrambling
down
the
side
of
the
a
motley
host
shoeless
and
clad
only
in
smudged
breeches
though
a
rope
ladder
dangled
from
the
gunwales
the
seamen
preferred
to
grasp
the
easing
themselves
onto
the
raised
gunport
lids
and
from
there
dropping
the
last
few
feet
into
the
pinnace
they
were
followed
by
george
elkington
who
lowered
himself
down
the
swaying
ladder
breathing
oaths
hawksworth
lingered
by
the
railing
searching
the
moonlit
horizon
and
the
darkened
coast
his
senses
quickened
as
he
probed
for
some
clue
that
would
trigger
an
advance
alert
but
the
moonlit
water
edge
lay
barren
deserted
save
for
an
occasional
beached
fishing
skiff
its
sisal
nets
exposed
on
poles
to
dry
why
the
emptiness
during
the
day
there
were
people
then
he
sensed
karim
standing
beside
him
also
intent
on
the
empty
shore
the
pilot
back
was
to
the
lantern
that
swung
from
the
mainmast
and
his
face
was
shrouded
in
shadow
abruptly
he
addressed
hawksworth
in
turki
the
face
of
india
glories
in
the
moonlight
do
you
agree
it
is
beautiful
and
lies
at
peace
you
right
about
the
beauty
it
could
almost
be
the
coast
of
wales
hawksworth
thought
he
sensed
a
powerful
presence
about
karim
now
something
he
could
not
explain
only
detect
with
a
troubled
intuition
then
the
pilot
spoke
again
have
you
prepared
yourself
to
meet
the
shahbandar
we
ready
we
have
samples
of
english
goods
and
i
an
ambassador
from
king
james
there
no
reason
to
deny
us
entry
i
told
you
he
is
a
man
of
importance
and
he
already
knows
as
all
who
matter
will
soon
know
of
your
exceptional
fortune
today
do
you
really
think
today
battle
will
go
unnoticed
in
india
i
think
the
portugals
noticed
and
i
know
they
be
back
but
with
luck
we
manage
hawksworth
felt
the
muscles
in
his
throat
tighten
involuntarily
knowing
a
fleet
of
warships
from
goa
would
probably
be
headed
north
within
a
fortnight
no
captain
again
you
miss
my
meaning
karim
turned
to
draw
closer
to
hawksworth
flashing
a
joyless
smile
i
speak
of
india
not
the
portuguese
they
are
nothing
yes
they
trouble
our
seas
but
they
are
nothing
they
do
not
rule
india
do
you
understand
hawksworth
stiffened
unsure
how
to
respond
i
know
the
moghul
rules
india
and
that
he
have
to
wonder
if
the
damned
portugals
are
still
master
of
his
seas
surely
you
realize
captain
that
the
portuguese
profits
are
staggering
are
you
also
aware
these
profits
are
shared
with
certain
persons
of
importance
in
india
you
mean
the
portugals
have
bribed
officials
that
nothing
new
hawksworth
thought
who
the
shahbandar
let
us
say
they
often
give
commissions
karim
waved
his
hand
as
though
administering
a
dispensation
but
there
are
others
whom
they
allow
to
invest
directly
in
their
trade
the
profits
give
these
persons
power
they
often
do
not
use
wisely
are
you
telling
me
the
moghul
himself
invests
with
the
damned
portugals
hawksworth
hopes
plummeted
on
the
contrary
his
majesty
is
an
honorable
man
and
a
simple
man
who
knows
but
little
of
what
some
do
in
his
name
but
do
you
understand
there
must
be
one
in
his
realm
who
will
someday
have
his
place
remember
he
is
mortal
he
rules
like
a
god
but
he
is
mortal
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
the
shahbandar
surely
he
not
challenge
the
moghul
and
i
know
the
moghul
has
sons
of
course
he
is
not
the
one
karim
smile
was
gentle
but
do
not
forget
the
shahbandar
is
powerful
more
powerful
than
most
realize
he
knows
all
that
happens
in
india
for
his
many
friends
repay
their
obligation
to
him
with
knowledge
as
for
you
if
he
judges
your
wisdom
worthy
of
your
fortune
today
he
may
choose
to
aid
you
your
journey
to
agra
will
not
be
without
peril
there
are
already
those
in
india
who
will
not
wish
you
there
perhaps
the
shahbandar
can
give
you
guidance
it
will
be
for
him
to
decide
hawksworth
studied
karim
incredulously
how
could
he
know
whatever
i
may
find
necessary
to
do
it
will
not
involve
a
port
official
like
the
shahbandar
and
a
trip
to
agra
surely
would
not
require
his
approval
but
you
must
find
your
way
karim
examined
hawksworth
with
a
quick
sidelong
glance
realizing
he
had
guessed
correctly
my
friend
your
defeat
of
the
portuguese
today
may
have
implications
you
do
not
realize
but
at
times
you
talk
as
a
fool
even
more
than
the
portuguese
you
will
need
a
guide
on
your
journey
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
karim
paused
for
a
moment
to
examine
hawksworth
as
though
wondering
how
to
couch
his
next
words
perhaps
you
should
let
the
stars
guide
you
in
the
holy
quran
the
prophet
has
said
of
allah
he
hath
set
for
you
the
stars
you
may
guide
your
course
by
them
hawksworth
picked
up
the
verse
the
dark
of
land
and
sea
yes
i
learned
that
verse
in
tunis
and
i
knew
already
a
seaman
steers
by
the
stars
but
i
understand
what
bearing
that
has
on
a
journey
to
agra
just
as
i
begin
to
think
you
have
wisdom
again
you
cease
to
listen
but
i
think
now
you
will
remember
what
i
have
said
hawksworth
elkington
voice
boomed
from
the
pinnace
below
have
we
sail
a
blessed
seven
month
to
this
nest
o
heathens
so
to
idle
about
and
palaver
hawksworth
turned
to
see
humphrey
spencer
gingerly
lowering
himself
down
the
ladder
into
the
pinnace
the
feather
in
his
hatband
whipping
in
the
night
wind
the
oarsmen
were
at
their
stations
ready
one
thing
more
captain
karim
pressed
a
hand
against
arm
holding
him
back
one
thing
more
i
will
tell
you
many
foreigners
who
come
to
india
are
very
unwise
because
our
women
keep
the
veil
and
dwell
indoors
foreigners
assume
they
have
no
power
no
influence
do
not
act
as
other
foolish
make
this
mistake
in
surat
what
women
do
you
mean
the
wives
of
officials
please
listen
when
you
reach
surat
remember
one
last
admonition
from
the
quran
there
it
is
written
for
women
from
whom
you
fear
rebellion
admonish
them
and
banish
them
to
beds
apart
but
sometimes
a
woman
too
can
be
she
can
be
the
one
who
banishes
her
husband
denying
him
his
rights
if
she
is
important
there
is
nothing
he
can
do
remember
damn
it
to
hell
elkington
voice
roared
again
i
not
these
moonlight
ventures
tis
full
risk
aplenty
when
you
can
see
holdin
a
knife
to
your
throat
but
if
we
goin
i
say
let
be
done
with
it
and
have
off
hawksworth
turned
back
to
karim
but
he
was
gone
swinging
himself
lightly
over
the
side
of
the
into
the
pinnace
across
the
swells
the
lay
quiet
her
stern
lantern
reassuringly
aglow
ready
to
hoist
sail
for
the
cove
and
on
the
seamen
were
at
station
poised
to
follow
hawksworth
looked
once
more
toward
the
abandoned
shore
troubled
and
then
dropped
quickly
down
the
side
into
the
pinnace
there
was
no
sound
now
only
the
cadence
of
the
boards
as
the
chain
argued
against
the
tide
and
then
a
dull
thud
as
the
mooring
line
dropped
onto
the
floor
planking
of
the
pinnace
hawksworth
ordered
mackintosh
to
row
with
the
tide
until
they
reached
the
shelter
of
the
river
mouth
and
then
to
ship
the
oars
and
hoist
sail
if
the
breeze
held
he
had
picked
the
ablest
men
as
oarsmen
those
not
wounded
and
least
touched
by
scurvy
and
next
to
each
lay
a
heavy
cutlass
he
watched
mackintosh
in
admiration
as
the
quartermaster
effortlessly
maneuvered
the
tiller
with
one
hand
and
directed
the
oarsmen
with
the
other
the
moon
was
even
more
alive
now
glinting
off
the
scotsman
red
hair
as
the
hypnotic
rhythm
of
the
oars
lulled
hawksworth
mind
he
felt
a
growing
tiredness
begin
to
beg
at
his
senses
against
his
will
he
started
to
drift
to
follow
the
moonlight
dancing
prismatic
tinge
on
the
moving
crest
of
waves
and
to
puzzle
over
what
lay
ahead
he
found
his
thoughts
drawn
to
the
shahbandar
who
waited
in
surat
almost
like
a
gatekeeper
who
held
the
keys
to
india
he
mulled
karim
words
again
the
hints
of
what
would
unlock
that
doorway
and
slowly
his
waking
mind
drifted
out
of
reach
he
passed
unknowing
into
that
dreamlike
state
where
deepest
truth
so
often
lies
waiting
unknown
to
rationality
and
there
somehow
the
pilot
words
made
perfect
sense
permission
to
hoist
the
sail
mackintosh
cut
the
pinnace
into
the
river
mouth
holding
to
the
center
of
the
channel
hawksworth
startled
momentarily
at
the
voice
then
forced
himself
alert
and
scanned
the
dark
riverbanks
there
was
still
nothing
he
nodded
to
mackintosh
and
watched
as
the
sail
slipped
quietly
up
the
mast
soon
the
wind
and
tide
were
carrying
them
swiftly
silently
as
he
watched
the
run
of
the
tide
against
the
hull
he
suddenly
noticed
a
group
of
round
objects
deep
red
bobbing
past
karim
hawksworth
drew
his
sword
and
pointed
toward
one
of
the
balls
what
are
those
a
fruit
of
our
country
captain
the
them
karim
voice
was
scarcely
above
a
whisper
and
his
eyes
left
the
shore
for
only
a
moment
they
are
the
last
remains
of
the
august
festival
what
festival
is
that
the
celebration
of
the
hindu
traders
marking
the
end
of
the
monsoon
and
the
opening
of
the
tapti
river
to
trade
hindus
at
surat
smear
coconuts
with
vermilion
and
cast
them
into
the
tapti
believing
this
will
appease
the
angry
of
the
sea
they
also
cover
barges
with
flowers
and
span
them
across
the
harbor
if
you
were
there
you
would
hear
them
play
their
music
and
chant
songs
to
their
heathen
gods
and
the
coconuts
eventually
float
out
to
sea
a
few
yes
but
mostly
they
are
stolen
by
wicked
boys
who
swim
after
them
these
few
perhaps
their
gods
saved
for
themselves
hawksworth
examined
the
bobbing
balls
anew
the
coconut
was
yet
another
legend
of
the
indies
stories
passed
that
a
man
could
live
for
days
on
the
liquor
sealed
within
its
shell
the
moon
chased
random
clouds
but
still
the
riverbank
was
illuminated
like
day
the
damp
air
was
still
amplifying
the
music
of
the
night
the
buzz
of
gnats
the
call
of
night
birds
even
the
occasional
trumpet
of
a
distant
elephant
pierced
the
solid
wood
line
on
either
side
of
the
narrowing
river
hawksworth
tasted
the
dark
alert
troubled
where
are
the
human
sounds
where
are
the
barges
i
saw
plying
the
river
mouth
during
the
day
i
sense
an
uneasiness
in
the
pilot
an
alarm
he
does
not
wish
me
to
see
damn
the
moon
if
only
we
had
dark
karim
hawksworth
spoke
softly
his
eyes
never
long
from
the
dense
rampart
of
trees
along
the
riverbank
what
do
you
wish
captain
have
you
ever
traveled
up
the
river
before
by
moonlight
once
yes
many
years
ago
when
i
was
young
and
burning
for
a
woman
after
our
ship
had
dropped
anchor
in
the
bay
i
was
only
a
then
a
common
seaman
and
i
thought
i
would
not
be
missed
i
was
wrong
the
discovered
me
in
surat
and
reclaimed
my
wage
for
the
entire
voyage
it
was
a
very
hungry
time
was
the
river
quiet
then
as
it
is
now
yes
captain
just
the
same
though
karim
looked
at
him
directly
the
darkness
still
guarded
his
eyes
mackintosh
hawksworth
voice
cut
the
silence
issue
the
muskets
his
eyes
swept
along
the
shore
and
then
to
the
narrow
bend
they
were
fast
approaching
karim
is
lying
he
told
himself
at
last
the
pilot
has
begun
to
play
false
with
us
why
what
does
he
fear
aye
aye
mackintosh
was
instantly
alert
what
do
you
see
the
sudden
voices
startled
elkington
awake
and
his
nodding
head
snapped
erect
the
damn
moors
have
settl
in
for
the
night
if
you
hold
your
peace
i
could
join
i
need
the
full
o
my
wits
for
hagglin
with
that
subtle
lot
o
thieves
come
the
morrow
no
portugals
the
night
birds
are
quiet
as
mice
precisely
hawksworth
shot
back
and
i
would
thank
you
to
take
a
musket
and
note
its
flintlock
is
and
the
flashpan
dry
then
he
continued
mackintosh
strike
the
sail
and
karim
take
the
tiller
the
pinnace
was
a
sudden
burst
of
activity
as
seamen
quickly
hauled
in
the
sail
and
began
to
check
the
prime
on
their
flintlocks
with
the
sail
lashed
their
view
was
unobstructed
in
all
directions
the
tide
rushing
through
the
narrows
of
the
approaching
bend
carried
the
pinnace
ever
more
rapidly
and
now
only
occasional
help
was
needed
from
the
oarsmen
to
keep
it
aright
a
cloud
drifted
over
the
moon
and
for
an
instant
the
river
turned
black
hawksworth
searched
the
darkness
ahead
silent
waiting
then
he
saw
it
on
the
boards
a
blaze
of
musket
fire
spanned
the
river
ahead
illuminating
the
blockade
of
longboats
balls
sang
into
the
water
around
them
while
others
splattered
off
the
side
of
the
pinnace
or
hissed
past
the
mast
then
the
returning
moon
glinted
off
the
silver
helmets
of
the
portuguese
infantry
as
karim
instinctively
cut
the
pinnace
toward
the
shore
portuguese
longboats
maneuvered
easily
toward
them
muskets
spewing
sporadic
flame
the
english
oarsmen
positioned
themselves
to
return
the
fire
but
hawksworth
stopped
them
not
yet
he
told
himself
we
have
no
chance
to
reload
the
first
round
has
to
count
and
damn
my
thoughtlessness
for
not
bringing
pikes
we
could
have
the
pinnace
lurched
crazily
and
careened
sideways
hurtling
around
broadside
to
the
longboats
a
sandbar
we
struck
a
damned
sandbar
but
we
got
to
face
them
with
the
prow
otherwise
as
though
sensing
hawksworth
thoughts
karim
seized
an
oar
and
began
to
pole
the
pinnace
stern
off
the
bar
slowly
it
eased
around
coming
about
to
face
the
approaching
longboats
no
sooner
had
the
pinnace
righted
itself
than
the
first
longboat
glanced
off
the
side
of
the
bow
and
a
grapple
caught
their
gunwale
then
the
first
portuguese
soldier
leaped
aboard
and
doubled
in
a
flame
of
sparks
as
mackintosh
shoved
a
musket
into
his
belly
and
pulled
the
trigger
as
the
other
english
muskets
spoke
out
in
a
spray
of
pistol
shot
several
portuguese
in
the
longboat
pitched
forward
writhing
mackintosh
began
to
bark
commands
for
reloading
your
muskets
wipe
your
pans
handle
your
primers
cast
about
to
charge
but
time
had
run
out
two
more
longboats
bracketed
each
side
of
the
bow
and
now
portuguese
were
piling
aboard
damn
the
muskets
hawksworth
yelled
take
your
swords
the
night
air
came
alive
with
the
sound
of
steel
against
steel
while
each
side
taunted
the
other
with
unintelligible
obscenities
the
english
were
outnumbered
many
to
one
and
slowly
they
found
themselves
being
driven
to
the
stern
of
the
pinnace
still
more
portuguese
poured
aboard
now
as
the
pinnace
groaned
against
the
sand
hawksworth
kept
to
the
front
of
his
men
matching
the
poorly
trained
portuguese
infantry
easily
thank
god
there
no
more
foot
room
he
thought
we
can
almost
stand
them
man
for
man
at
that
moment
two
portuguese
pinned
hawksworth
sword
against
the
mast
allowing
a
third
to
gain
footing
and
lunge
as
hawksworth
swerved
to
avoid
the
thrust
his
foot
crashed
through
the
thin
planking
covering
the
keel
bringing
him
down
mackintosh
yelled
a
warning
and
leaped
forward
slashing
the
first
soldier
through
the
waist
and
sending
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
pinnace
moaning
then
the
quartermaster
seized
the
other
man
by
the
throat
and
lunging
like
a
bull
whipped
him
against
the
mast
snapping
his
neck
hawksworth
groped
blindly
for
his
sword
and
watched
as
the
third
soldier
poised
for
a
mortal
sweep
where
is
it
good
god
he
cut
me
in
half
suddenly
he
felt
a
cold
metal
object
pressed
against
his
hand
and
above
the
din
he
caught
humphrey
spencer
voice
urging
it
was
a
pocket
pistol
did
he
prime
it
does
he
know
how
as
the
portuguese
soldier
began
his
swing
hawksworth
raised
the
pistol
and
squeezed
there
was
a
dull
snap
a
hiss
and
then
a
blaze
that
melted
the
soldier
face
into
red
he
flung
the
pistol
aside
and
seized
the
dying
portuguese
sword
he
was
armed
again
but
there
was
little
advantage
left
slowly
the
english
were
crowded
into
a
huddle
of
the
stern
cornered
abaft
the
mast
they
no
longer
had
room
to
parry
hawksworth
watched
in
horror
as
a
burly
portuguese
his
silver
helmet
askew
braced
himself
against
the
mast
and
drew
back
his
sword
to
send
a
swath
through
the
english
hawksworth
tried
to
set
a
parry
but
his
arms
were
pinned
he
kill
half
the
men
the
bastard
will
a
bemused
expression
unexpectedly
illuminated
the
soldier
face
a
smile
with
no
mirth
in
an
instant
it
transmuted
to
disbelief
while
his
raised
sword
clattered
to
the
planking
as
hawksworth
watched
the
portuguese
hand
began
to
work
mechanically
at
his
chest
then
his
helmet
tumbled
away
and
he
slumped
forward
motionless
but
still
erect
he
stood
limp
head
cocked
sideways
as
though
distracted
during
prayer
why
does
he
move
was
this
all
some
bizarre
senseless
jest
then
hawksworth
saw
the
arrows
a
neat
row
of
thin
bamboo
shafts
had
pierced
the
soldier
portuguese
armor
riveting
him
to
the
mast
a
hum
swallowed
the
sudden
silence
as
volleys
of
bamboo
arrows
sang
from
the
darkness
of
the
shore
measured
deadly
hawksworth
watched
in
disbelief
as
one
by
one
the
portuguese
soldiers
around
them
crumpled
a
few
firing
wildly
into
the
night
in
what
seemed
only
moments
it
was
over
the
air
a
cacophony
of
screams
and
moaning
death
hawksworth
turned
to
karim
noting
fright
in
the
pilot
eyes
for
the
very
first
time
the
arrows
he
finally
found
his
voice
whose
are
they
i
can
probably
tell
you
the
pilot
stepped
forward
and
deftly
broke
away
the
feathered
tip
on
one
of
the
shafts
still
holding
the
portuguese
to
the
mast
as
he
did
so
the
other
arrows
snapped
and
the
portuguese
slumped
against
the
gunwale
then
slipped
over
the
side
and
into
the
dark
water
karim
watched
him
disappear
then
raised
the
arrow
to
the
moonlight
for
an
instant
hawksworth
thought
he
saw
a
quizzical
look
enter
the
pilot
eyes
before
he
could
speak
lines
of
fire
shot
across
the
surface
of
the
water
as
fire
arrows
came
slamming
into
the
longboats
as
they
drifted
away
on
the
tide
streak
after
streak
found
the
hulls
and
in
moments
they
were
torches
in
the
flickering
light
hawksworth
could
make
out
what
seemed
to
be
grapples
flashing
from
the
shore
pulling
the
floating
bodies
of
the
dead
and
dying
to
anonymity
he
watched
spellbound
for
a
moment
then
turned
again
toward
the
stern
karim
i
asked
whose
arrows
the
pilot
was
gone
only
the
english
seamen
remained
dazed
and
uncomprehending
then
the
night
fell
suddenly
silent
once
more
save
for
the
slap
of
the
running
tide
against
the
hull
book
two
surat
the
threshold
chapter
five
the
room
was
musty
and
close
as
though
the
rainy
season
had
not
passed
and
the
floor
was
hard
mud
through
crude
wooden
shutters
they
could
glimpse
the
early
sun
stoking
anew
for
the
day
inferno
but
now
it
merely
washed
the
earthen
walls
in
stripes
of
golden
light
hawksworth
stood
by
the
window
examining
the
grassy
square
that
spanned
out
toward
the
river
the
porters
in
whose
lodge
they
were
confined
milled
about
the
open
area
chanting
and
sweating
as
they
unloaded
large
bales
of
cotton
from
the
bullock
carts
that
continually
rolled
into
the
square
he
steadied
himself
against
the
heavy
wooden
frame
of
the
window
and
wondered
if
his
land
legs
would
return
before
the
day
was
out
god
curse
all
moors
mackintosh
stooped
over
the
tray
resting
on
the
center
carpet
and
pulled
a
lid
from
one
of
the
earthen
bowls
he
stared
critically
at
the
dense
milky
liquid
inside
then
gingerly
dipped
in
a
finger
and
took
a
portion
to
his
lips
he
tested
the
substance
tangy
curds
smelling
faintly
of
spice
and
his
face
hardened
tis
damned
spoilt
milk
he
spat
fiercely
onto
the
carpet
and
seized
a
piece
of
fried
bread
to
purge
the
taste
fitter
for
swine
than
men
what
they
do
with
the
samples
elkington
sprawled
heavily
in
the
corner
his
eyes
bloodshot
from
the
vigil
upriver
with
no
guards
the
heathens
be
thievin
the
lot
he
squinted
toward
the
window
but
made
no
effort
to
move
his
exhaustion
and
despair
were
total
the
goods
are
still
where
they
unloaded
them
hawksworth
revolved
toward
the
room
they
say
nothing
happens
till
the
shahbandar
arrives
what
they
say
about
him
elkington
slowly
drew
himself
to
his
feet
they
said
he
arrives
at
mid
morning
verifies
his
seal
on
the
customs
house
door
and
then
orders
it
opened
they
also
said
that
all
traders
must
be
searched
personally
by
his
officers
he
imposes
duty
on
everything
right
down
to
the
shillings
in
your
pocket
damn
if
i
pay
duty
not
for
samples
that
what
i
said
and
they
ignored
me
it
seems
to
be
law
hawksworth
noticed
that
the
gold
was
dissolving
from
the
dawn
sky
surrendering
to
a
brilliant
azure
he
turned
scooped
a
portion
of
curds
onto
a
piece
of
fried
bread
and
silently
chewed
as
he
puzzled
over
the
morning
and
the
night
before
who
had
saved
them
and
why
did
someone
in
india
hate
the
portuguese
so
much
they
would
defend
the
english
before
even
knowing
who
they
were
no
one
in
india
could
know
about
king
james
letter
about
the
east
india
company
plans
no
one
even
george
elkington
did
not
know
everything
yet
someone
in
india
already
wanted
the
english
alive
he
had
wrestled
with
the
question
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
upriver
and
he
could
think
of
no
answers
they
had
been
saved
for
a
reason
a
reason
he
did
not
know
and
that
worried
him
even
more
than
the
portuguese
without
a
pilot
they
had
had
to
probe
upriver
slowly
sounding
for
sandbars
with
an
oar
finally
when
they
were
near
exhaustion
the
river
suddenly
curved
and
widened
then
in
the
first
dim
light
of
morning
they
caught
the
unmistakable
outlines
of
a
harbor
it
had
to
be
surat
the
river
lay
now
with
the
main
city
sprawled
along
its
eastern
shore
the
tide
began
to
fall
back
depleted
and
he
realized
they
had
timed
its
flow
perfectly
as
they
waited
for
dawn
the
port
slowly
revealed
itself
in
the
eastern
glow
long
stone
steps
emerged
directly
from
the
tapti
river
and
broadened
into
a
wide
airy
square
flanked
on
three
sides
by
massive
stone
buildings
the
structure
on
the
downriver
side
was
obviously
a
fortress
built
square
with
a
large
turret
at
each
corner
and
along
the
top
of
walls
hawksworth
could
see
the
muzzles
of
cannon
they
looked
to
be
trained
directly
on
the
water
and
in
the
waning
dark
he
spotted
tiny
points
of
light
spaced
regularly
along
the
top
of
the
fortress
walls
that
could
only
mean
one
thing
mackintosh
ship
the
oars
and
drop
anchor
we
ca
dock
until
daylight
aye
but
why
not
take
her
in
now
we
can
see
to
make
a
landin
and
they
can
see
us
well
enough
to
position
their
cannon
look
carefully
along
there
hawksworth
directed
his
gaze
toward
the
top
of
the
fortress
they
lighted
linstocks
for
the
guns
mother
of
god
do
they
think
we
goin
to
storm
their
harbor
with
a
pinnace
probably
a
standard
precaution
but
if
we
hold
here
at
least
keep
at
the
edge
of
their
range
and
we
better
put
all
weapons
out
of
sight
i
want
them
to
see
a
pinnace
of
friendly
traders
at
sunup
the
dawn
opened
quickly
and
as
they
watched
the
square
blossomed
to
life
large
carts
appeared
through
the
drawn
by
muscular
black
oxen
some
of
whose
horns
had
been
tipped
in
silver
one
by
one
the
oxen
lumbered
into
the
square
urged
forward
by
the
shouts
and
beatings
of
turbaned
drivers
who
wore
folded
white
skirts
instead
of
breeches
small
fires
were
kindled
by
some
of
the
men
and
the
unmistakable
scent
of
glowing
dung
chips
savored
the
dark
clouds
of
smoke
that
drifted
out
across
the
river
surface
then
hawksworth
first
noticed
the
bathers
that
had
appeared
along
the
shore
on
either
side
of
the
stone
steps
brown
men
stripped
to
loincloths
and
women
in
brilliantly
colored
wraps
were
easing
themselves
ceremoniously
into
the
chilled
water
some
bowing
repeatedly
in
the
direction
of
the
rising
sun
only
the
waters
fronting
the
stairway
remained
unobstructed
when
the
dawn
sky
had
lightened
to
a
muted
red
hawksworth
decided
to
start
their
move
he
surveyed
the
men
crowded
in
the
pinnace
one
last
time
and
read
in
some
faces
expectation
and
in
others
fear
but
in
all
there
was
fatigue
only
elkington
seemed
fully
absorbed
in
the
vision
that
lay
before
them
even
from
their
distance
the
chief
merchant
was
already
assessing
the
goods
being
unloaded
from
the
carts
rolls
of
brown
cloth
bundles
of
indigo
and
bales
of
combed
cotton
fiber
he
would
point
then
turn
and
gesture
excitedly
as
he
lectured
spencer
the
young
clerk
was
now
a
bedraggled
remnant
of
fashion
in
the
smudged
remains
of
his
new
doublet
the
plumed
hat
he
had
worn
as
they
cast
off
had
been
lost
in
the
attack
downriver
and
now
he
crouched
in
the
bottom
of
the
pinnace
humiliated
and
morose
his
eyes
vacant
mackintosh
weigh
anchor
we
row
to
the
steps
slowly
the
men
bobbed
alert
as
they
hoisted
the
chain
into
the
prow
of
the
pinnace
oars
were
slipped
noisily
into
their
rowlocks
and
mackintosh
signaled
to
get
underway
as
they
approached
the
stairway
alarmed
cries
suddenly
arose
from
the
sentinels
stationed
on
stone
platforms
flanking
either
side
of
the
steps
in
moments
a
crowd
collected
along
the
river
with
turbaned
men
shouting
in
a
language
hawksworth
could
not
place
and
gesturing
the
pinnace
away
from
the
dock
what
could
they
want
he
asked
himself
who
are
they
they
not
armed
they
do
look
hostile
just
upset
permission
to
land
hawksworth
shouted
to
them
in
turkish
his
voice
slicing
through
the
din
and
throwing
a
sudden
silence
over
the
crowd
the
customs
house
does
not
open
until
two
hours
before
midday
a
tall
bearded
man
shouted
back
then
he
squinted
toward
the
pinnace
who
are
you
portuguese
no
we
english
so
that
it
hawksworth
thought
they
assumed
we
were
portugals
with
a
boatload
of
booty
here
for
a
bit
of
private
trade
the
man
examined
the
pinnace
in
confusion
then
he
shouted
again
over
the
waters
you
are
not
portuguese
i
told
you
we
english
only
portuguese
are
allowed
to
trade
the
man
was
now
scrutinizing
the
pinnace
in
open
perplexity
we
no
goods
for
trade
only
samples
hawksworth
tried
to
think
of
a
way
to
confound
the
bureaucratic
mind
we
only
want
food
and
drink
you
can
not
land
at
this
hour
in
name
of
allah
the
merciful
hawksworth
stretched
for
his
final
ploy
invocation
of
that
hospitality
underlying
all
islamic
life
demands
can
be
ignored
a
traveler
need
never
food
and
drink
for
my
men
miraculously
it
seemed
to
work
the
bearded
man
stopped
short
and
examined
them
again
closely
then
he
turned
and
dictated
rapidly
to
the
group
of
waiting
porters
in
moments
the
men
had
plunged
into
the
chilled
morning
water
calling
for
the
mooring
line
of
the
pinnace
as
they
towed
the
pinnace
into
the
shallows
near
the
steps
other
porters
swarmed
about
the
boat
and
gestured
to
indicate
the
english
should
climb
over
the
gunwales
and
be
carried
ashore
they
caught
hold
of
george
elkington
first
he
clung
futilely
to
the
gunwales
as
he
was
dragged
cursing
from
the
bobbing
pinnace
and
hoisted
on
the
backs
of
two
small
indian
men
arms
flailing
he
toppled
himself
from
their
grasp
and
splashed
backward
into
the
muddy
tapti
after
he
floated
to
the
surface
sputtering
he
was
dragged
bodily
from
the
water
and
up
the
steps
then
the
others
were
carried
ashore
and
only
mackintosh
tried
to
protest
the
last
to
leave
the
pinnace
hawksworth
hoisted
himself
off
the
prow
and
onto
the
back
of
a
wiry
indian
whose
thin
limbs
belied
their
strength
the
man
turban
smelled
faintly
of
sweat
but
his
shirt
was
spotless
his
dark
eyes
assessed
hawksworth
with
a
practiced
sidelong
glance
evaluating
his
attire
his
importance
and
the
approximate
cash
value
of
his
sword
in
a
single
sweep
only
after
the
porters
had
deposited
them
on
the
stone
steps
did
hawksworth
finally
realize
that
india
best
port
had
no
wharf
that
human
backs
served
as
the
loading
platform
for
all
men
and
goods
as
he
looked
around
he
also
noticed
they
had
been
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
men
not
identified
by
turbans
as
were
the
porters
but
uniformed
more
expensively
and
wielding
long
heavy
canes
wordlessly
automatically
the
men
aligned
themselves
in
two
rows
to
create
a
protected
pathway
leading
up
the
steps
and
into
the
square
hawksworth
watched
as
they
beat
back
the
gathering
crowd
of
onlookers
with
their
canes
and
he
suddenly
understood
this
was
how
the
port
prevented
traders
from
passing
valuables
to
an
accomplice
in
the
crowd
and
circumventing
customs
then
the
tall
bearded
man
approached
hawksworth
smiled
professionally
and
bowed
in
the
manner
of
karim
hands
together
at
the
brow
you
are
welcome
in
the
name
of
the
shahbandar
as
a
guest
only
not
as
a
trader
without
further
greeting
he
directed
them
across
the
open
square
toward
a
small
stone
building
you
will
wait
in
the
porters
lodge
until
the
customs
house
opens
as
he
ordered
the
heavy
wooden
door
opened
he
curtly
added
the
shahbandar
will
rule
whether
your
presence
here
is
permitted
he
had
watched
them
enter
and
then
he
was
gone
shortly
after
the
food
had
appeared
hawksworth
examined
the
room
once
more
its
close
air
still
damp
with
the
chill
of
dawn
the
walls
were
squared
and
the
ceiling
high
and
arched
in
a
back
corner
a
niche
had
been
created
and
in
it
rested
a
small
round
stone
pillar
presumably
a
religious
object
but
one
hawksworth
did
not
recognize
who
would
venerate
a
column
of
stone
he
mused
particularly
one
which
seems
almost
like
a
man
organ
it
be
the
muslims
they
worship
their
own
organs
like
no
other
race
but
they
generally
honor
their
law
against
icons
so
it
must
be
for
the
gentiles
the
hindus
which
means
that
the
porters
are
hindus
and
their
overseers
moors
that
the
privilege
of
conquerors
just
like
every
other
land
the
moors
have
seized
by
the
sword
he
glanced
again
at
the
tray
and
noted
that
the
food
had
been
completely
devoured
consumed
by
ravenous
seamen
who
would
have
scorned
to
touch
milk
curds
six
months
before
after
a
moment
consideration
hawksworth
turned
and
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
carpet
nothing
to
be
done
we
may
as
well
rest
while
we
have
the
chance
george
elkington
had
rolled
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
carpet
and
now
he
dozed
fitfully
humphrey
spencer
fought
sleep
as
he
worked
vainly
to
brush
away
the
powder
smudges
from
his
doublet
mackintosh
had
finished
whetting
his
seaman
knife
and
now
sat
absorbed
in
searching
his
hair
for
lice
bosun
mate
john
garway
lounged
against
a
side
wall
idly
scratching
his
codpiece
and
dreaming
of
the
women
he
would
soon
have
his
toothless
smile
fixed
in
sleepy
anticipation
the
master
mate
thomas
davies
dozed
in
a
heap
by
the
door
his
narrow
face
depleted
and
aged
with
scurvy
in
a
back
corner
dice
and
a
pile
of
coins
had
miraculously
appeared
and
the
other
seamen
sprawled
about
them
on
the
floor
bloodshot
eyes
focused
on
the
chance
numbers
that
would
spell
the
longest
splurge
in
port
hawksworth
stretched
his
wounded
leg
once
more
leaned
stiffly
against
the
front
wall
and
forced
his
mind
to
drift
again
into
needed
rest
hawksworth
was
suddenly
alert
his
senses
troubled
the
sun
had
reached
midmorning
now
and
it
washed
the
mud
floor
in
brilliant
yellow
light
he
sensed
that
a
heavy
shadow
had
passed
through
its
beam
he
had
not
specifically
seen
it
but
somehow
intuitively
he
knew
without
a
word
he
edged
to
the
side
of
the
heavy
wooden
door
his
hand
close
to
his
sword
handle
all
the
others
except
mackintosh
were
by
now
asleep
only
the
quartermaster
had
noticed
it
he
quickly
moved
to
the
side
of
the
door
opposite
hawksworth
and
casually
drew
his
heavy
knife
without
warning
the
door
swung
outward
facing
them
was
the
same
bearded
man
who
had
invited
them
ashore
the
square
behind
him
was
bright
now
with
the
glare
of
late
morning
and
in
the
light
hawksworth
realized
he
was
wearing
an
immaculate
white
turban
a
long
blue
skirt
over
tightly
fitting
white
breeches
and
ornate
leather
shoes
turned
up
at
the
toe
in
a
curved
point
this
time
however
he
no
longer
bore
welcome
where
have
you
anchored
your
ships
the
turki
was
accented
and
abrupt
news
travels
fast
hawksworth
thought
as
he
tried
to
shove
the
haze
from
his
mind
where
is
the
shahbandar
your
merchantmen
were
not
in
the
bay
this
morning
where
are
they
now
the
man
seemed
to
ignore
hawksworth
question
i
demand
to
see
the
shahbandar
and
i
answer
no
questions
till
i
do
you
do
not
demand
of
the
shahbandar
the
man
black
beard
worked
nervously
even
when
he
paused
you
and
all
your
men
are
to
be
brought
to
the
customs
house
together
with
your
goods
where
is
he
now
he
is
here
where
the
indian
turned
and
gestured
quickly
across
the
maidan
the
square
toward
the
large
windowless
stone
building
that
sat
on
the
water
edge
opposite
the
fortress
hawksworth
looked
at
the
cluster
of
armed
guards
and
realized
this
must
be
the
mint
this
was
the
building
he
now
remembered
karim
telling
him
where
foreign
money
was
exchanged
all
foreign
coins
even
spanish
rials
of
eight
were
required
to
be
melted
down
and
reminted
into
rupees
before
they
could
be
used
for
purchase
supposedly
a
protection
against
counterfeit
or
base
coin
this
requirement
produced
months
of
delay
the
shahbandar
gave
only
one
alternative
to
traders
in
a
hurry
borrow
rupees
at
exorbitant
interest
after
he
has
authorized
the
beginning
of
today
work
at
the
mint
he
will
verify
the
seal
on
the
door
of
the
customs
house
he
pointed
to
the
squat
building
adjoining
their
lodge
and
open
it
for
today
all
goods
must
be
taxed
and
receive
his
seal
before
they
can
enter
or
leave
india
the
men
had
begun
to
stir
and
hawksworth
turned
to
translate
the
english
assembled
warily
and
the
air
came
alive
with
an
almost
palpable
apprehension
as
hawksworth
led
them
into
the
bustling
square
we
must
wait
the
tall
indian
suddenly
paused
near
the
center
of
the
maidan
just
as
a
group
of
guards
emerged
from
the
mint
each
wore
a
heavy
sword
and
they
were
escorting
a
large
closed
palanquin
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
four
bearers
dressed
only
in
white
skirts
folded
about
their
waist
the
guards
cleared
a
path
through
the
crowd
of
merchants
and
made
their
way
slowly
to
the
door
of
the
customs
house
the
crowd
surged
in
behind
them
blocking
the
view
but
moments
later
the
tall
doors
of
the
customs
house
were
seen
to
swing
open
and
the
crowd
funneled
in
behind
the
palanquin
and
the
guards
then
the
indian
motioned
for
them
to
follow
the
interior
of
the
customs
house
smelled
of
sweat
mingled
with
spice
and
the
dusty
fragrance
of
indigo
as
oil
lamps
were
lighted
and
attached
to
the
side
walls
the
milling
crowd
grew
visible
through
the
porters
were
already
bearing
the
english
goods
in
from
the
and
piling
them
in
one
of
the
allotted
stalls
the
tall
guide
turned
to
hawksworth
you
and
all
your
men
must
now
be
searched
here
in
the
counting
room
i
not
allow
it
hawksworth
motioned
the
english
back
i
told
you
i
demand
to
see
the
shahbandar
he
receive
you
when
he
will
he
has
not
granted
an
audience
then
we
not
be
searched
tell
him
that
now
the
indian
paused
for
a
moment
then
reluctantly
turned
and
made
his
way
toward
a
door
at
the
rear
of
the
large
room
elkington
pressed
forward
his
face
strained
tell
the
bleedin
heathen
we
english
we
not
be
treated
like
this
rabble
he
motioned
around
the
room
a
bedlam
of
arab
persian
and
indian
traders
who
eyed
the
english
warily
as
they
shouted
for
the
attention
of
customs
inspectors
and
competed
to
bribe
porters
just
hold
quiet
i
think
they
know
exactly
who
we
are
and
they
know
about
the
ships
as
they
waited
hawksworth
wondered
what
he
should
tell
the
shahbandar
and
he
again
puzzled
over
the
words
of
karim
think
what
can
you
tell
him
that
he
has
already
heard
i
wager
he
knows
full
well
we
were
attacked
by
portugals
in
the
bay
that
we
burned
and
sank
two
galleons
will
he
now
hold
us
responsible
for
warfare
in
indian
waters
i
even
wager
he
knows
we
were
attacked
on
the
river
and
who
saved
us
the
large
indian
was
returning
striding
through
the
center
aisle
accompanied
by
four
of
the
shahbandar
guards
he
motioned
for
hawksworth
to
follow
alone
the
door
of
the
rear
chamber
was
sheathed
in
bronze
with
heavy
ornate
hinges
and
an
immense
hasp
it
seemed
to
swing
open
of
itself
as
they
approached
and
they
were
in
the
chamber
of
the
shahbandar
as
he
entered
hawksworth
was
momentarily
blinded
by
the
blaze
of
oil
lamps
that
lined
the
walls
of
the
room
unlike
the
simple
plaster
walls
and
pillars
of
the
outer
receiving
area
this
inner
chamber
was
forbiddingly
ornate
with
gilded
ceilings
almost
thirty
feet
high
the
room
was
already
bustling
with
clerks
straightening
piles
of
account
books
and
readying
themselves
for
the
day
affairs
the
room
fell
silent
and
a
way
suddenly
cleared
through
the
center
as
the
hindu
clerks
fell
back
along
the
walls
they
all
wore
tight
neat
headdresses
and
formal
cotton
top
shirts
and
hawksworth
felt
a
sudden
consciousness
of
his
own
clothes
muddy
boots
and
jerkin
and
breeches
for
the
first
time
since
they
arrived
he
found
himself
in
a
room
with
no
other
europeans
the
isolation
felt
sudden
and
complete
then
he
saw
the
shahbandar
on
a
raised
dais
at
the
rear
of
the
room
beneath
a
canopy
of
embroidered
cloth
sat
the
chief
port
official
of
india
he
rested
stiffly
on
a
couch
strewn
with
cushions
and
he
wore
a
turban
of
blue
silk
patterned
trousers
and
an
embroidered
tan
robe
that
crossed
to
the
right
over
his
plump
belly
and
was
secured
with
a
row
of
what
appeared
to
be
rubies
he
seemed
oblivious
to
hawksworth
as
he
cursed
and
drew
on
the
end
of
a
tube
being
held
to
his
mouth
by
an
attending
clerk
the
clerk
other
hand
worked
a
burning
taper
over
the
open
top
of
a
clay
pot
the
tube
being
held
to
the
shahbandar
mouth
was
attached
to
a
spout
on
the
side
suddenly
hawksworth
heard
a
gurgle
from
the
pot
and
saw
the
shahbandar
inhale
a
mouthful
of
dark
smoke
tobacco
is
the
only
thing
the
brought
to
india
that
she
did
not
already
have
even
then
we
still
had
to
devise
the
hookah
to
smoke
it
properly
he
inhaled
appreciatively
it
is
forbidden
during
this
month
of
ramadan
but
no
man
was
made
to
fast
during
daylight
and
also
forgo
tobacco
the
morning
sun
still
rose
in
the
east
and
thus
it
is
written
the
gate
of
repentance
remains
open
to
god
servants
the
shahbandar
examined
hawksworth
with
curiosity
his
face
recalled
hard
desert
nomad
blood
but
now
it
was
softened
with
ease
plump
and
moustachioed
he
wore
gold
earrings
and
he
was
barefoot
favor
me
by
coming
closer
i
must
see
this
who
brings
such
turmoil
to
our
waters
he
turned
and
cursed
the
servant
as
the
hookah
continued
to
gurgle
inconclusively
then
a
roll
of
smoke
burst
through
the
tube
and
the
shahbandar
eyes
mellowed
as
he
drew
it
deeply
into
his
lungs
he
held
the
smoke
for
a
moment
while
he
gazed
quizzically
at
hawksworth
squinting
as
though
the
air
between
them
were
opaque
they
tell
me
you
are
english
may
i
have
the
pleasure
to
know
your
name
i
brian
hawksworth
captain
of
the
frigate
may
i
also
have
the
privilege
of
an
introduction
i
will
stand
before
allah
as
mirza
nuruddin
he
again
drew
deeply
on
the
hookah
but
here
i
am
the
shahbandar
he
exhaled
a
cloud
and
examined
hawksworth
your
ship
and
another
were
in
our
bay
yesterday
i
am
told
they
weighed
anchor
at
nightfall
do
english
vessels
customarily
sail
without
their
captain
when
they
have
reason
to
do
so
hawksworth
fixed
him
squarely
wondering
if
he
was
really
almost
blind
or
if
he
merely
wanted
to
appear
so
and
what
captain
hawksworth
brings
you
and
your
contentious
warships
to
our
port
it
is
not
often
our
friends
the
portuguese
permit
their
fellow
christians
to
visit
us
our
ships
are
traders
of
england
east
india
company
do
not
squander
my
time
telling
me
what
i
already
know
the
shahbandar
suddenly
seemed
to
erupt
they
have
never
before
come
to
india
why
are
you
here
now
hawksworth
sensed
suddenly
that
the
shahbandar
had
been
merely
toying
with
him
that
he
knew
full
well
why
they
had
come
and
had
already
decided
what
to
do
he
recalled
the
words
of
karim
declaring
the
shahbandar
had
his
own
private
system
of
spies
we
are
here
for
the
same
reason
we
have
visited
the
islands
to
trade
the
goods
of
europe
but
we
already
do
trade
with
europeans
the
portuguese
who
also
protect
our
seas
have
you
found
profit
in
it
enough
but
it
is
not
your
place
to
question
me
captain
hawksworth
then
you
may
wish
to
profit
through
english
trade
as
well
and
your
merchants
i
assume
also
expect
to
profit
here
that
the
normal
basis
of
trade
hawksworth
shifted
easing
his
leg
the
shahbandar
glanced
downward
but
without
removing
his
lips
from
the
tube
of
the
hookah
i
notice
you
have
a
wound
captain
hawksworth
yours
would
seem
a
perilous
profession
it
sometimes
even
more
perilous
for
our
enemies
i
presume
you
mean
the
portuguese
the
shahbandar
cursed
the
servant
anew
and
called
for
a
new
taper
to
fire
the
hookah
but
their
perils
are
over
yours
have
only
begun
surely
you
do
not
expect
they
will
allow
you
to
trade
here
trade
here
is
a
matter
between
england
and
india
it
does
not
involve
the
portugals
the
shahbandar
smiled
but
we
have
a
trade
agreement
with
the
portuguese
a
signed
by
his
majesty
the
moghul
of
india
allowing
them
free
access
to
our
ports
we
have
no
such
agreement
with
england
then
we
were
mistaken
we
believed
the
port
of
surat
belonged
to
india
not
to
the
portugals
hawksworth
felt
his
palms
moisten
at
the
growing
game
of
nerves
india
you
would
say
has
no
ports
of
her
own
no
authority
to
trade
with
whom
she
will
you
come
to
our
door
with
warfare
and
insolence
captain
hawksworth
perhaps
i
would
have
been
surprised
if
you
had
done
otherwise
the
shahbandar
paused
to
draw
thoughtfully
on
the
smoking
mouthpiece
why
should
i
expect
this
although
you
would
not
ask
let
me
assume
you
have
the
reputation
of
english
sea
dogs
is
not
unknown
in
the
indies
and
i
can
easily
guess
who
brought
you
these
libelous
reports
of
england
perhaps
you
should
examine
their
motives
we
have
received
guidance
in
our
judgment
from
those
we
have
trusted
for
many
years
the
shahbandar
waved
aside
the
hookah
and
fixed
hawksworth
with
a
hard
gaze
hawksworth
returned
the
unblinking
stare
for
a
moment
while
an
idea
formed
in
his
mind
i
believe
it
once
was
written
are
those
who
purchase
error
at
the
price
of
guidance
so
their
commerce
does
not
prosper
neither
are
they
guided
a
sudden
hush
enveloped
the
room
as
the
shahbandar
examined
hawksworth
with
uncharacteristic
surprise
for
a
moment
his
eyes
seemed
lost
in
concentration
then
they
quickly
regained
their
focus
the
holy
quran
surah
ii
if
i
have
not
lost
the
lessons
of
my
youth
he
stopped
and
smiled
in
disbelief
it
impossible
a
should
know
the
words
of
the
merciful
prophet
on
whom
be
peace
you
are
a
man
of
curious
parts
english
captain
again
he
paused
and
you
dissemble
with
all
the
guile
of
a
i
merely
speak
the
truth
then
speak
the
truth
to
me
now
captain
hawksworth
is
it
not
true
the
english
are
a
notorious
nation
of
pirates
that
your
merchants
live
off
the
commerce
of
others
pillaging
where
they
see
fit
should
i
not
inquire
therefore
whether
you
intrude
into
our
waters
for
the
same
purpose
england
has
warred
in
years
past
on
her
rightful
enemies
but
our
wars
are
over
the
east
india
company
was
founded
for
peaceful
trade
and
the
company
is
here
for
no
purpose
but
to
trade
peacefully
with
merchants
in
surat
hawksworth
dutifully
pressed
forward
our
two
merchantmen
bring
a
rich
store
of
english
goods
woolens
ironwork
lead
while
you
war
with
the
portuguese
in
sight
of
our
very
shores
will
you
next
make
war
on
our
own
merchants
i
told
it
is
your
historic
livelihood
as
he
studied
hawksworth
the
shahbandar
found
himself
reflecting
on
the
previous
evening
the
sun
had
set
and
the
ramadan
meal
was
already
underway
when
father
manoel
pinheiro
the
portuguese
jesuit
in
india
had
appeared
at
his
gates
demanding
an
audience
for
two
tiresome
hours
he
had
endured
the
jesuit
pained
excuses
for
portugal
latest
humiliation
at
sea
and
his
boasts
that
the
english
would
never
survive
a
trip
upriver
and
for
the
first
time
mirza
nuruddin
could
remember
he
had
smelled
fear
mirza
nuruddin
had
sensed
no
fear
in
the
portuguese
eight
years
before
when
an
english
captain
named
lancaster
had
attacked
and
pillaged
a
portuguese
galleon
in
the
seas
off
java
then
the
viceroy
of
goa
brayed
he
would
know
retribution
although
nothing
was
ever
done
and
a
mere
five
years
ago
the
viceroy
himself
led
a
fleet
of
twelve
warships
to
malacca
boasting
to
burn
the
eleven
dutch
merchantmen
lading
there
and
the
dutch
sank
almost
his
entire
fleet
now
the
pirates
of
malabar
daily
harassed
indian
shipping
the
length
of
the
western
coast
and
the
portuguese
patrols
seemed
powerless
to
control
them
in
one
short
decade
he
told
himself
the
portuguese
have
shown
themselves
unable
to
stop
the
growing
dutch
spice
trade
in
the
islands
unable
to
rid
india
coasts
of
pirates
and
now
now
unable
to
keep
other
europeans
from
india
own
doorstep
he
studied
hawksworth
again
and
asked
himself
why
the
english
had
come
and
why
the
two
small
english
vessels
had
challenged
four
armed
galleons
instead
of
turning
and
making
for
open
sea
to
trade
a
cargo
of
wool
no
cargo
was
worth
the
risk
they
had
taken
there
had
to
be
another
reason
and
that
reason
or
whatever
lay
behind
it
terrified
the
portuguese
for
the
first
time
ever
we
defend
ourselves
when
attacked
that
all
hawksworth
found
himself
wanting
to
end
the
questions
to
escape
the
smoky
room
and
the
shahbandar
intense
gaze
that
has
no
bearing
on
our
request
to
trade
in
this
port
i
will
take
your
request
under
advisement
in
the
meantime
you
and
your
men
will
be
searched
and
your
goods
taxed
in
keeping
with
our
law
you
may
search
the
men
if
you
wish
but
i
am
here
as
representative
of
the
king
of
england
and
as
his
representative
i
will
not
allow
my
personal
chest
to
be
searched
no
more
than
his
majesty
king
james
of
england
would
submit
to
such
an
indignity
hawksworth
decided
to
reach
for
all
the
authority
his
ragged
appearance
would
allow
all
except
ambassadors
must
be
searched
do
you
claim
that
immunity
i
am
an
ambassador
and
i
will
be
traveling
to
agra
to
represent
my
king
permission
for
travel
in
india
must
come
from
the
moghul
himself
the
shahbandar
face
remained
impassive
but
his
mind
raced
the
stakes
of
the
english
game
were
not
wool
he
suddenly
realized
but
india
the
english
king
was
challenging
portugal
for
the
trade
of
india
their
audacity
as
astonishing
a
request
can
be
sent
to
agra
by
the
governor
of
this
province
then
i
must
see
him
to
ask
that
a
message
be
sent
to
agra
for
now
i
demand
that
my
personal
effects
be
released
from
the
customs
house
and
that
no
duty
be
levied
on
our
goods
which
are
samples
and
not
for
sale
if
your
goods
are
not
taxed
they
will
remain
in
the
customs
house
that
is
the
law
because
you
claim
to
represent
your
king
i
will
forgo
my
obligation
to
search
your
person
all
of
your
men
however
will
be
searched
down
to
their
boots
and
any
goods
or
coin
they
bring
through
this
port
will
be
taxed
according
to
the
prevailing
rate
two
and
half
percent
of
value
our
chief
merchant
wishes
to
display
his
samples
to
your
traders
i
have
told
you
i
will
consider
your
request
for
trade
there
are
many
considerations
he
signaled
for
the
hookah
to
be
lighted
again
the
interview
seemed
to
be
ended
hawksworth
bowed
with
what
formality
he
could
muster
and
turned
toward
the
door
captain
hawksworth
you
will
not
be
returning
to
your
men
i
have
made
other
arrangements
for
your
lodging
hawksworth
revolved
to
see
four
porters
waiting
by
an
open
door
at
the
shahbandar
left
i
must
be
tired
i
had
noticed
the
door
until
now
then
he
realized
it
had
been
concealed
in
the
decorations
on
the
wall
when
he
did
not
move
the
porters
surrounded
him
no
they
not
porters
they
the
guards
who
held
back
the
crowds
from
the
steps
and
they
armed
now
i
think
you
will
find
your
lodgings
suitable
the
shahbandar
watched
hawksworth
body
tense
my
men
will
escort
you
your
chest
will
remain
here
under
my
care
the
shahbandar
returned
again
to
his
gurgling
hookah
my
chest
will
not
be
subject
to
search
if
it
is
to
be
searched
i
will
return
now
to
my
ship
hawksworth
still
did
not
move
your
officials
will
respect
my
king
and
his
honor
it
is
in
my
care
the
shahbandar
waved
hawksworth
toward
the
door
he
did
not
look
up
from
his
pipe
as
hawksworth
passed
into
the
midday
sunshine
he
saw
the
own
palanquin
waiting
by
the
door
directly
ahead
spread
the
teeming
horse
and
cattle
bazaar
while
on
his
right
under
a
dense
banyan
tree
a
beggar
sat
on
a
pallet
clothed
only
in
a
white
loincloth
and
wearing
ashes
in
his
braided
hair
and
curious
white
and
red
marks
on
his
forehead
his
eyes
were
burning
and
intense
and
he
inspected
the
new
though
he
just
seen
the
person
of
the
devil
why
should
i
travel
hidden
from
view
hawksworth
puzzled
but
there
was
no
time
to
ponder
an
answer
the
cloth
covering
was
lifted
and
he
found
himself
urged
into
the
cramped
conveyance
made
even
more
comfortless
and
hot
by
its
heavy
carpet
lining
and
bolster
seat
in
moments
the
street
had
disappeared
into
jolting
darkness
chapter
six
he
felt
the
palanquin
drop
roughly
onto
a
hard
surface
and
when
the
curtains
were
pulled
aside
he
looked
down
to
see
the
stone
mosaic
of
a
garden
courtyard
they
had
traveled
uphill
at
least
part
of
the
time
with
what
seemed
many
unnecessary
turns
and
windings
and
now
they
were
hidden
from
the
streets
by
the
high
walls
of
a
garden
enclosure
tall
slender
palms
lined
the
inside
of
the
garden
white
plaster
wall
and
denser
trees
shaded
a
central
building
decorated
around
its
entry
with
raised
arabic
lettering
in
ornate
plasterwork
the
guards
motioned
him
through
the
large
wooden
portico
of
the
house
which
he
began
to
suspect
might
be
the
residence
of
a
wealthy
merchant
after
a
long
hallway
they
entered
a
spacious
room
with
clean
white
walls
and
a
thick
center
carpet
over
a
floor
of
patterned
marble
inlay
large
pillows
lay
strewn
about
the
carpet
and
the
air
hung
heavy
with
the
stale
scent
of
spice
it
the
house
of
a
rich
merchant
or
official
all
right
what
else
can
it
be
the
decorated
panels
on
the
doors
and
the
large
brass
knobs
all
indicate
wealth
but
what
the
room
for
for
guests
no
it
too
empty
there
almost
no
furniture
no
bed
no
then
suddenly
he
understood
a
banquet
room
he
realized
he
had
never
seen
a
more
sumptuous
private
dining
hall
even
among
the
aristocracy
in
london
the
guards
closed
the
heavy
wooden
doors
but
there
was
no
sound
of
their
footsteps
retreating
who
are
they
protecting
me
from
a
servant
with
skin
the
color
of
ebony
and
a
white
turban
that
seemed
to
enclose
a
large
part
of
his
braided
and
beard
pushed
open
an
interior
door
to
deposit
a
silver
tray
more
fried
bread
and
a
bowl
of
curds
where
am
i
whose
house
the
man
bowed
made
hand
signs
pleading
incomprehension
and
retreated
without
a
word
as
hawksworth
started
to
reach
for
a
piece
of
the
bread
the
outer
door
opened
and
one
of
the
guards
stepped
briskly
to
the
tray
and
stopped
his
hand
he
said
nothing
merely
signaled
to
wait
moments
later
another
guard
also
entered
and
with
him
was
a
woman
she
was
unveiled
with
dark
skin
and
heavy
gold
bangles
about
her
ankles
she
stared
at
hawksworth
with
frightened
eyes
brisk
words
passed
in
an
alien
language
and
then
the
woman
pointed
to
hawksworth
and
raised
her
voice
as
she
replied
to
the
guard
he
said
nothing
but
simply
lifted
a
long
sheathed
knife
from
his
waist
and
pointed
it
toward
the
tray
his
gesture
signifying
all
after
a
moment
pause
the
woman
edged
forward
and
gingerly
sampled
the
curds
with
her
fingers
first
sniffing
and
then
reluctantly
tasting
more
words
passed
after
which
the
guards
bowed
to
hawksworth
almost
imperceptibly
and
escorted
the
woman
from
the
room
closing
the
door
hawksworth
watched
in
dismay
and
then
turned
again
to
examine
the
dishes
if
they
that
worried
food
can
wait
who
was
she
probably
a
slave
of
the
shahbandar
he
removed
his
boots
tossed
them
in
the
corner
and
eased
himself
onto
the
bolsters
piled
at
one
end
of
the
central
carpet
the
wound
in
his
leg
had
become
a
dull
ache
jesus
help
me
i
tired
what
does
the
shahbandar
really
want
why
was
karim
so
fearful
of
him
and
what
the
role
of
the
governor
in
all
this
will
all
these
requests
and
permissions
and
permits
end
up
delaying
us
so
long
the
portugals
will
find
our
anchorage
and
what
will
the
governor
want
out
of
me
he
tried
to
focus
his
mind
on
the
governor
on
a
figure
he
sculpted
in
his
imagination
a
fat
repugnant
pompous
bureaucrat
but
the
figure
slowly
began
to
transform
and
in
time
it
became
the
turk
who
had
imprisoned
him
in
tunis
with
a
braided
fez
and
a
jeweled
dagger
at
his
waist
the
fat
turk
was
not
listening
he
was
issuing
a
decree
you
will
stay
only
then
will
i
have
what
i
want
what
i
must
have
next
a
veiled
woman
entered
the
room
and
her
eyes
were
like
maggie
she
seized
his
hand
and
guided
him
toward
the
women
apartments
past
the
frowning
guards
who
raised
large
scimitars
in
interdiction
until
she
waved
them
aside
then
she
led
him
to
the
center
of
a
brilliantly
lighted
room
until
they
stood
before
a
large
stone
pillar
a
pillar
like
the
one
in
the
porters
lodge
except
it
was
immense
taller
than
his
head
you
belong
to
me
now
her
eyes
seemed
to
say
and
she
began
to
bind
him
to
the
pillar
with
silken
cords
he
struggled
to
free
himself
but
the
grasp
on
his
wrists
only
became
stronger
in
panic
he
struck
out
and
yelled
through
the
haze
of
incense
let
i
only
trying
to
wake
you
captain
a
voice
cut
through
the
nightmare
his
eminence
the
shahbandar
has
requested
that
i
attend
your
wound
hawksworth
startled
awake
and
was
reaching
for
his
sword
before
he
saw
the
swarthy
little
man
incongruous
in
a
white
swath
of
a
skirt
and
a
portuguese
doublet
nervously
shaking
his
arm
the
man
pulled
back
in
momentary
surprise
then
dropped
his
cloth
medicine
bag
on
the
floor
and
began
to
carefully
fold
a
large
red
umbrella
hawksworth
noted
he
wore
no
shoes
on
his
dusty
feet
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
he
bowed
ceremoniously
my
name
is
mukarjee
it
is
my
honor
to
attend
the
celebrated
new
his
turki
was
halting
and
strongly
accented
he
knelt
and
deftly
cut
away
the
wrapping
on
hawksworth
leg
and
who
applied
this
with
transparent
disdain
he
began
uncoiling
the
muddy
bandage
the
christian
astound
me
even
though
my
daughter
is
married
to
one
one
eyebrow
twitched
nervously
as
he
worked
hawksworth
stared
at
him
through
a
groggy
haze
marveling
at
the
dexterity
of
his
hands
then
he
glanced
nervously
at
the
vials
of
colored
liquid
and
jars
of
paste
the
man
was
methodically
extracting
from
his
cloth
bag
it
was
our
ship
physician
he
swathed
this
after
attending
a
dozen
men
with
like
wounds
or
worse
no
explanations
are
necessary
methods
are
always
unmistakable
in
goa
where
i
lived
for
many
years
after
leaving
bengal
i
once
served
in
a
hospital
built
by
christian
priests
you
worked
in
a
jesuit
hospital
i
did
indeed
he
began
to
scrape
away
the
oily
powder
residue
from
the
wound
hawksworth
leg
jerked
involuntarily
from
the
flash
of
pain
please
do
not
move
yes
i
served
there
until
i
could
abide
it
no
more
it
was
a
very
exclusive
hospital
only
allowed
to
go
there
to
be
bled
he
began
to
wash
the
wound
superficial
but
already
festering
with
a
solution
from
one
of
the
vials
yes
we
indians
were
denied
that
almost
certain
entry
into
christian
paradise
represented
by
its
portals
but
it
was
usually
the
first
stop
for
arriving
portuguese
after
the
brothels
but
why
do
so
many
portuguese
sicken
after
they
reach
goa
hawksworth
watched
mukarjee
begin
to
knead
a
paste
that
smelled
strongly
of
sandalwood
spice
it
well
that
you
ask
captain
hawksworth
mukarjee
tested
the
consistency
of
the
sandalwood
paste
with
his
finger
and
then
placed
it
aside
apparently
to
thicken
you
appear
to
be
a
strong
man
but
after
many
months
at
sea
you
may
not
be
as
virile
as
you
assume
he
absently
extracted
a
large
dark
green
leaf
from
the
pocket
of
his
doublet
and
dabbed
it
in
a
paste
he
kept
in
a
crumpled
paper
then
he
rolled
it
around
the
cracked
pieces
of
a
small
brown
nut
popped
it
into
his
mouth
and
began
to
chew
suddenly
remembering
himself
he
stopped
and
produced
another
leaf
from
his
pocket
would
you
care
to
try
betel
what
they
call
pan
here
in
surat
very
healthy
for
the
teeth
and
the
digestion
what
is
it
a
delicious
leaf
i
find
i
can
not
live
without
it
so
perhaps
it
a
true
addiction
it
slightly
bitter
by
itself
but
if
you
roll
it
around
an
areca
nut
and
dip
it
in
a
bit
of
lime
which
we
make
from
mollusk
shells
it
is
perfectly
exquisite
hawksworth
shook
his
head
in
wary
dissent
whereupon
mukarjee
continued
settling
himself
on
his
haunches
and
sucking
contentedly
on
the
rolled
leaf
as
he
spoke
you
ask
why
i
question
your
captain
because
a
large
number
of
the
who
come
to
goa
and
india
are
doomed
to
die
you
already
said
that
from
what
poison
in
their
food
mukarjee
examined
him
quizzically
for
a
moment
as
he
concentrated
on
the
rolled
leaf
savoring
the
taste
and
hawksworth
noticed
a
red
trickle
emerge
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
slide
slowly
off
his
chin
he
turned
and
discharged
a
mouthful
of
juice
into
a
small
brass
container
clearing
his
mouth
to
speak
the
most
common
illness
for
europeans
here
is
called
the
bloody
flux
mukarjee
tested
the
paste
again
with
his
finger
and
then
began
to
stir
it
vigorously
with
a
wooden
spatula
for
four
or
five
days
the
body
burns
with
intense
heat
and
then
either
it
is
gone
or
you
are
dead
are
there
no
medicines
hawksworth
watched
as
he
began
to
spread
the
paste
over
the
wound
of
course
there
are
medicines
mukarjee
chuckled
resignedly
but
the
portuguese
scorn
to
use
them
probably
wisely
hawksworth
reflected
it
said
the
flux
is
caused
by
an
excess
of
humors
in
the
blood
bleeding
is
the
only
real
remedy
i
see
mukarjee
began
to
apply
the
paste
and
then
to
bind
hawksworth
leg
with
a
swath
of
white
cloth
yes
my
friend
that
is
what
the
portuguese
do
you
must
hold
still
and
i
have
personally
observed
how
effective
it
is
in
terminating
illness
the
damned
jesuits
are
the
best
physicians
in
europe
so
i
have
often
been
told
most
frequently
at
funerals
mukarjee
quickly
tied
a
knot
in
the
binding
and
spat
another
mouthful
of
red
juice
your
wound
is
really
nothing
more
than
a
scratch
but
you
would
have
been
dead
in
a
fortnight
by
this
if
not
by
exertion
what
do
you
mean
hawksworth
rose
and
tested
his
leg
amazed
that
the
pain
seemed
to
have
vanished
the
greatest
scourge
of
all
for
newly
arrived
europeans
here
seems
to
be
our
women
it
is
inevitable
and
my
greatest
source
of
amusement
he
spat
the
exhausted
betel
leaf
toward
the
corner
of
the
room
and
paused
dramatically
while
he
prepared
another
explain
what
you
mean
about
the
women
let
me
give
you
an
example
from
goa
mukarjee
squatted
again
the
portuguese
soldiers
arriving
from
lisbon
each
year
tumble
from
their
ships
more
dead
than
alive
weak
from
months
at
sea
and
the
inevitable
scurvy
they
are
in
need
of
proper
food
but
they
pay
no
attention
to
this
for
they
are
even
more
starved
for
the
company
of
women
by
the
way
how
is
your
wound
mukarjee
made
no
attempt
to
suppress
a
smile
at
hawksworth
astonished
testing
of
his
leg
the
pain
seems
to
be
gone
he
tried
squatted
in
indian
style
like
mukarjee
and
found
that
this
posture
too
brought
no
discomfort
well
these
soldiers
immediately
avail
themselves
of
goa
many
brothels
which
i
note
christians
seem
to
frequent
with
greater
devotion
than
their
fine
churches
what
uneven
test
of
skill
and
vigor
transpires
i
would
not
speculate
but
many
of
these
find
the
only
beds
suited
for
them
are
in
the
jesuit
kings
hospital
where
few
ever
leave
i
watched
some
five
hundred
portuguese
a
year
tread
this
path
of
folly
mukarjee
lips
were
now
the
hue
of
the
rose
and
what
happens
to
those
who
do
live
they
eventually
wed
one
of
our
women
or
one
of
their
own
and
embrace
the
life
of
sensuality
that
marks
the
portuguese
in
goa
with
twenty
sometimes
even
thirty
slaves
to
supply
their
wants
and
pleasure
and
after
a
time
they
develop
stones
in
the
kidney
or
gout
or
some
other
affliction
of
excess
what
do
their
wives
die
of
the
same
thing
some
yes
but
i
have
also
seen
many
charged
with
adultery
by
their
fat
portuguese
husbands
a
suspicion
rarely
without
grounds
for
they
really
have
nothing
more
to
do
on
hot
afternoons
than
chew
betel
and
intrigue
with
the
lusty
young
soldiers
and
executed
the
women
are
said
to
deem
it
an
honorable
martyrdom
vowing
they
die
for
love
mukarjee
rose
and
began
meticulously
replacing
the
vials
in
his
cloth
bag
i
may
be
allowed
to
visit
you
again
if
you
wish
but
i
think
there
no
need
only
forgo
the
company
of
our
women
for
a
time
my
friend
practice
prudence
before
pleasure
a
shaft
of
light
from
the
hallway
cut
across
the
room
as
the
door
opened
without
warning
a
guard
stood
in
the
passageway
wearing
a
uniform
hawksworth
had
not
seen
before
i
must
be
leaving
now
mukarjee
voice
rose
to
public
volume
as
he
nervously
scooped
up
his
umbrella
and
his
bag
without
pausing
to
secure
the
knot
at
its
top
then
he
bent
toward
hawksworth
with
a
quick
whisper
captain
the
shahbandar
has
sent
his
rajputs
you
must
take
care
he
deftly
slipped
past
the
guard
in
the
doorway
and
was
gone
hawksworth
examined
the
rajputs
warily
they
wore
leather
helmets
secured
with
a
colored
headband
length
tunics
over
heavy
fitting
trousers
and
a
broad
cloth
belt
a
large
round
leather
shield
hung
at
each
man
side
suspended
from
a
shoulder
strap
and
each
guard
wore
an
ornate
quiver
at
his
waist
from
which
protruded
a
heavy
horn
bow
and
bamboo
arrows
all
were
intent
and
unsmiling
their
leader
his
face
framed
in
a
thicket
of
coarse
black
hair
stepped
through
the
doorway
and
addressed
hawksworth
in
halting
turki
the
shahbandar
has
requested
your
presence
at
the
customs
house
i
am
to
inform
you
he
has
completed
all
formalities
for
admission
of
your
personal
chest
and
has
approved
it
with
his
the
palanquin
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
when
they
entered
the
street
but
now
hawksworth
was
surrounded
as
they
began
walking
he
noticed
the
pain
in
his
leg
was
gone
the
street
was
lined
by
plaster
walls
and
the
cool
evening
air
bore
the
scent
of
flowers
from
their
concealed
gardens
the
houses
behind
the
walls
were
partially
shielded
by
tall
trees
but
he
could
tell
they
were
several
stories
high
with
flat
roofs
on
which
women
clustered
watching
these
must
all
be
homes
of
rich
muslim
merchants
palaces
for
the
princes
of
commerce
and
the
streets
are
filled
with
poor
probably
servants
or
slaves
in
no
hurry
to
end
the
errand
that
freed
them
from
their
drudgery
inside
then
as
they
started
downhill
toward
the
river
they
began
to
pass
homes
he
guessed
were
owned
by
hindu
merchants
since
they
were
without
gardens
or
the
high
walls
muslims
used
to
hide
their
women
as
they
neared
the
river
the
air
started
to
grow
sultry
and
they
began
passing
the
huts
of
shopkeepers
and
clerks
roofed
in
palm
leaves
with
latticework
grills
for
windows
finally
they
reached
the
bazaar
of
surat
its
rows
of
palm
trees
deserted
now
with
silence
where
earlier
he
had
heard
a
tumult
of
hawkers
and
strident
women
voices
next
to
the
bazaar
stood
the
stables
and
hawksworth
noticed
flocks
of
small
boys
naked
save
for
a
loincloth
scavenging
to
find
any
dung
cakes
that
had
been
overlooked
by
the
women
who
collected
fuel
the
air
was
dense
and
smelled
of
earth
and
its
taste
overwhelmed
his
lingering
memory
of
the
wind
off
the
sea
the
streets
of
surat
converged
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
with
the
customs
house
and
port
as
its
hub
just
like
every
port
town
in
the
world
hawksworth
smiled
to
himself
all
roads
lead
to
the
sea
except
here
all
roads
lead
to
the
customs
house
and
the
shahbandar
then
as
they
approached
the
last
turn
in
the
road
just
outside
the
enclosure
of
the
customs
house
they
were
suddenly
confronted
by
a
band
of
mounted
horsemen
armed
with
muskets
the
horsemen
spanned
the
roadway
and
were
probably
twenty
in
all
well
outnumbering
the
rajputs
the
horsemen
made
no
effort
to
move
aside
as
hawksworth
and
his
guards
approached
hawksworth
noticed
the
rajputs
stiffen
slightly
and
their
hands
drop
loosely
to
the
horn
bows
protruding
from
their
quivers
but
they
did
not
break
their
pace
my
god
they
not
going
to
halt
there
be
bloodshed
and
sure
to
lose
without
warning
a
hand
threw
hawksworth
sprawling
against
the
thick
plaster
side
of
a
building
and
a
large
round
buckler
suddenly
was
covering
his
body
shielding
him
entirely
from
the
horsemen
next
came
a
melee
of
shouts
and
he
peered
out
to
see
the
rajputs
encircling
him
crouched
in
a
firing
pose
each
bow
aimed
on
a
horseman
and
taut
with
its
first
arrow
the
horsemen
fumbled
with
their
still
uncocked
weapons
in
lightning
moves
of
only
seconds
the
rajputs
had
seized
the
advantage
not
only
are
their
bows
more
accurate
than
muskets
hawksworth
thought
they
also
handier
they
can
loose
half
a
dozen
arrows
before
a
musket
can
be
reprimed
but
what
was
the
signal
i
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
yet
they
acted
as
one
i
never
before
seen
such
speed
such
discipline
then
more
shouting
hawksworth
did
not
recognize
the
language
but
he
guessed
it
might
be
urdu
the
mixture
of
imported
persian
and
native
hindi
karim
had
said
was
used
in
the
moghul
army
as
a
compromise
between
the
language
of
its
officers
and
the
speaking
infantry
the
rajputs
did
not
move
as
the
horseman
in
the
lead
withdrew
a
rolled
paper
from
his
waist
and
contemptuously
tossed
it
onto
the
ground
in
front
of
them
while
the
others
covered
him
with
their
bows
the
leader
of
the
rajputs
advanced
and
retrieved
the
roll
from
the
dust
hawksworth
watched
as
he
unscrolled
it
and
examined
in
silence
at
the
bottom
hawksworth
could
make
out
the
red
mark
of
a
like
the
one
he
had
seen
on
bundles
in
the
customs
house
the
paper
was
passed
among
the
rajputs
each
studying
it
in
turn
particularly
the
seal
then
there
were
more
shouts
and
finally
resolution
the
leader
of
guard
approached
him
and
bowed
then
he
spoke
in
turki
his
voice
betraying
none
of
the
emotion
hawksworth
had
witnessed
moments
before
they
are
guards
of
the
governor
mukarrab
khan
they
have
shown
us
orders
by
the
shahbandar
bearing
his
seal
instructing
that
you
be
transferred
to
their
care
you
will
go
with
them
then
he
dropped
his
bow
casually
into
his
quiver
and
led
the
other
men
off
in
the
direction
of
the
customs
house
all
still
marching
as
though
they
knew
no
other
pace
captain
hawksworth
please
be
tolerant
of
our
hindu
friends
they
are
soldiers
of
fortune
and
a
trifle
in
their
manners
the
leader
of
the
guard
smiled
and
pointed
to
a
riderless
saddled
horse
being
held
by
one
of
the
riders
we
have
a
mount
for
you
will
you
kindly
join
us
hawksworth
looked
at
the
horse
a
spirited
arabian
mare
and
then
at
the
saddle
a
heavy
round
tapestry
embroidered
in
silver
thread
with
tassels
front
and
back
held
by
a
thick
girth
also
of
tapestry
the
stirrups
were
small
triangles
of
iron
held
by
a
leather
strap
attached
to
a
ring
at
the
top
of
the
girth
a
second
tapestry
band
around
the
mare
neck
secured
the
saddle
near
the
mane
the
mane
itself
had
been
woven
with
decorations
of
beads
and
small
feathers
the
horse
neck
was
held
in
a
permanent
arch
by
a
leather
checkrein
extending
from
the
base
of
the
bridle
through
the
chest
strap
and
secured
to
the
lower
girth
the
mare
pranced
in
anticipation
while
her
coat
sparkled
in
the
waning
sun
she
was
a
thing
of
pure
beauty
where
are
we
going
but
of
course
the
governor
mukarrab
khan
has
staged
a
small
celebration
this
afternoon
and
would
be
honored
if
you
could
join
him
today
is
the
final
day
of
ramadan
our
muslim
fast
he
at
the
field
but
come
patience
is
not
his
most
enduring
quality
hawksworth
did
not
move
why
did
the
shahbandar
change
his
order
we
were
going
to
the
customs
house
to
fetch
my
chest
the
governor
is
a
persuasive
man
it
was
his
pleasure
that
you
join
him
this
afternoon
but
please
mount
he
is
waiting
the
man
stroked
his
moustache
with
a
manicured
hand
as
he
nodded
toward
the
waiting
mount
his
excellency
sent
one
of
his
finest
horses
i
think
he
has
a
surprise
for
you
hawksworth
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
and
immediately
his
mare
tossed
her
head
in
anticipation
she
was
lanky
and
spirited
nothing
like
the
lumbering
mount
his
father
had
once
taught
him
to
ride
at
the
army
camp
outside
london
so
many
many
years
ago
without
another
word
the
men
wheeled
their
horses
and
started
off
in
a
direction
parallel
to
the
river
then
the
one
who
had
spoken
abruptly
halted
the
entire
party
please
forgive
me
but
did
i
introduce
myself
i
am
the
secretary
to
his
excellency
mukarrab
khan
we
were
cast
from
the
civilized
comforts
of
agra
onto
this
dung
heap
port
of
surat
together
perhaps
it
was
our
stars
hawksworth
was
only
to
the
man
he
turned
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
in
time
to
see
the
rajputs
entering
into
the
compound
of
the
customs
house
the
leader
of
the
horsemen
caught
his
glance
and
smiled
let
me
apologize
again
for
our
friends
of
the
rajput
guard
you
do
understand
they
have
no
official
standing
they
serve
whomever
they
are
paid
to
serve
if
that
thief
the
shahbandar
discharged
them
tomorrow
and
then
another
hired
them
to
kill
him
they
would
do
so
without
a
word
rajputs
are
professional
mercenaries
who
do
battle
as
coldly
as
the
tiger
hunts
game
he
turned
his
horse
onto
a
wide
avenue
that
paralleled
the
river
the
sunlight
was
now
filtered
through
the
haze
of
evening
smoke
from
cooking
fires
that
was
enveloping
the
city
do
rajputs
also
serve
the
governor
the
man
laughed
broadly
and
smoothed
the
braided
mane
of
his
horse
as
he
twisted
sideways
in
the
saddle
and
repeated
hawksworth
question
for
the
other
riders
a
peal
of
amusement
cut
the
quiet
of
the
evening
streets
my
dear
english
captain
he
might
wish
to
hang
them
but
he
would
never
hire
them
his
excellency
has
the
pick
of
the
moghul
infantry
and
cavalry
in
this
district
men
of
lineage
and
breeding
why
should
he
need
hindus
hawksworth
monitored
the
riders
carefully
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
thought
he
detected
a
trace
of
nervousness
in
their
mirth
yes
he
told
himself
why
use
hindus
except
the
shahbandar
hindu
mercenaries
got
the
advantage
of
you
in
only
seconds
while
you
and
your
pick
of
the
moghul
cavalry
were
fiddling
with
your
uncocked
muskets
perhaps
there
a
good
reason
the
shahbandar
does
hire
men
of
lineage
and
breeding
hawksworth
noticed
they
were
paralleling
a
wall
of
the
city
a
high
brick
barrier
with
iron
pikes
set
along
its
capstone
abruptly
the
wall
curved
across
the
road
they
were
traveling
and
they
were
facing
a
massive
wooden
gate
that
spanned
the
width
of
the
street
suddenly
guards
appeared
each
in
uniform
and
holding
a
pike
they
hurriedly
swung
wide
the
gate
as
the
procession
approached
then
snapped
crisply
to
attention
along
the
roadside
this
is
the
abidjan
gate
the
secretary
nodded
in
response
to
the
salute
of
the
guards
you
can
just
see
the
field
from
here
he
pointed
ahead
then
urged
his
horse
to
a
gallop
a
cooling
dampness
was
invading
the
evening
air
and
now
the
sun
had
entirely
disappeared
into
the
cloud
of
dense
cooking
smoke
that
boiled
above
the
city
layering
a
dark
mantle
over
the
landscape
again
hawksworth
felt
his
apprehension
rising
what
the
purpose
of
bringing
me
to
a
field
outside
the
city
with
dark
approaching
he
instinctively
fingered
the
cool
handle
of
his
sword
but
its
feel
did
nothing
to
ease
his
mind
then
he
heard
cheers
from
the
field
ahead
and
saw
a
burning
ball
fly
across
the
evening
sky
ahead
was
a
large
green
and
on
it
horsemen
raced
back
and
forth
shouting
and
cursing
in
several
languages
their
horses
jostling
recklessly
other
mounted
horsemen
watched
from
the
side
of
the
green
and
bellowed
encouragement
as
they
approached
the
edge
of
the
field
hawksworth
saw
one
of
the
players
capture
the
burning
ball
guiding
it
along
the
green
with
a
long
stick
whose
end
appeared
to
be
curved
he
spurred
his
mottled
gray
mount
toward
two
tall
posts
stationed
at
one
end
of
the
green
another
player
was
hard
in
chase
and
his
horse
a
dark
stallion
was
closing
rapidly
toward
the
rolling
ball
as
the
first
player
swept
upward
with
his
stick
lofting
the
burning
ball
toward
the
posts
the
second
player
passed
him
and
in
a
maneuver
that
seemed
dazzling
to
hawksworth
circled
his
own
stick
over
his
head
and
captured
the
ball
in
midair
deflecting
it
toward
the
edge
of
the
green
where
hawksworth
and
his
guards
waited
cheers
went
up
from
some
of
the
players
and
spectators
and
the
horsemen
all
dashed
for
the
edge
of
the
green
in
chase
of
the
ball
which
rolled
in
among
hawksworth
entourage
and
out
of
play
the
horseman
on
the
dark
stallion
suddenly
noticed
hawksworth
and
with
a
shout
to
the
other
players
whipped
his
steed
toward
the
arriving
group
as
he
approached
hawksworth
studied
his
face
carefully
he
was
pudgy
but
still
athletic
with
a
short
moustache
and
a
tightly
wound
turban
secured
with
a
large
red
stone
that
looked
like
a
ruby
he
carried
himself
erect
with
a
confidence
only
full
vigor
could
impart
yet
his
face
was
incongruously
debauched
almost
ravaged
and
his
eyes
deeply
weary
there
was
no
hint
of
either
triumph
or
pleasure
in
those
eyes
or
in
his
languorous
mouth
although
he
had
just
executed
a
sensational
block
of
an
almost
certain
score
he
reined
his
wheezing
mount
only
when
directly
in
front
of
hawksworth
sending
up
a
cloud
of
dust
are
you
the
english
captain
the
voice
was
loud
with
an
impatient
tone
indicating
long
years
of
authority
i
command
the
frigates
of
the
east
india
company
hawksworth
tried
to
keep
his
gaze
steady
what
sort
of
man
can
this
be
he
asked
himself
is
this
the
one
who
can
demand
the
shahbandar
signature
and
seal
whenever
he
wishes
then
i
welcome
you
captain
the
dark
stallion
reared
suddenly
for
no
apparent
reason
in
a
display
of
exuberance
the
man
expertly
reined
him
in
never
removing
his
gaze
from
hawksworth
and
continued
in
an
even
voice
i
been
most
eager
to
meet
the
man
who
is
suddenly
so
interesting
to
our
portuguese
friends
although
i
have
a
personal
rule
never
to
dabble
in
the
affairs
of
europeans
as
a
sportsman
i
must
congratulate
you
on
your
victory
a
pity
i
missed
the
encounter
i
accept
your
congratulations
on
behalf
of
the
east
india
company
hawksworth
watched
him
for
some
sign
of
his
attitude
toward
the
portuguese
but
he
could
detect
nothing
but
smooth
diplomacy
yes
the
east
india
company
i
suppose
this
company
of
yours
wants
something
from
india
and
i
can
easily
imagine
it
might
be
profit
perhaps
i
should
tell
you
straightaway
that
such
matters
bore
me
not
a
little
the
man
glanced
impatiently
back
toward
the
field
but
come
it
growing
darker
as
we
talk
i
hoped
you
might
join
us
in
our
little
game
it
elementary
should
be
child
play
for
a
man
who
commands
at
sea
he
turned
to
one
of
the
men
standing
by
the
side
of
the
field
ahmed
prepare
a
stick
for
captain
by
the
way
i
given
your
name
hawksworth
yes
prepare
a
stick
for
captain
hawksworth
he
be
joining
us
hawksworth
stared
at
the
man
trying
to
gauge
his
impulsiveness
you
i
presume
are
the
governor
forgive
me
i
so
rarely
find
introductions
required
mukarrab
khan
your
humble
servant
yes
it
my
fate
to
be
governor
of
surat
but
only
because
there
no
outpost
less
interesting
but
come
we
lose
precious
time
he
pivoted
his
pawing
mount
about
and
signaled
for
a
new
ball
to
be
ignited
you
find
our
game
very
simple
captain
hawksworth
the
object
is
to
take
the
ball
between
the
posts
you
see
there
what
we
call
the
there
are
two
teams
of
five
players
but
we
normally
rotate
players
every
twenty
minutes
his
horse
reared
again
in
anticipation
as
the
new
ball
was
brought
onto
the
field
years
ago
we
played
only
during
the
hours
of
day
but
then
our
moghul
father
the
great
akman
introduced
the
burning
ball
so
he
could
play
at
night
it
very
light
and
hawksworth
felt
a
nudge
on
his
hand
and
looked
down
to
see
a
stick
being
passed
upward
by
one
of
the
attendants
the
handle
was
sheathed
in
silver
and
the
stick
itself
was
over
six
feet
long
with
a
flattened
curve
at
the
bottom
like
a
distorted
shepherd
crook
hawksworth
lifted
it
gingerly
testing
its
weight
and
was
surprised
by
its
lightness
you
will
be
playing
on
the
team
of
abul
hasan
he
nodded
toward
a
man
with
a
youthful
face
and
no
moustache
he
is
a
here
in
surat
a
judge
who
interprets
and
dispenses
law
and
when
not
busy
abusing
the
powers
of
his
office
he
presumes
to
challenge
me
at
the
official
bowed
slightly
but
did
not
smile
his
dappled
gray
mare
was
sniffing
at
the
governor
stallion
he
thinks
he
has
me
at
a
disadvantage
since
in
agra
we
played
with
only
one
goal
whereas
here
they
use
two
but
a
test
of
skill
not
rules
he
leads
the
white
turbans
only
then
did
hawksworth
notice
that
the
governor
team
all
wore
red
turbans
the
governor
waved
to
his
attendant
a
clean
turban
for
the
english
captain
i
prefer
to
play
as
i
am
hawksworth
saw
a
flash
of
disbelief
in
the
governor
eyes
it
was
obvious
he
was
never
contradicted
i
never
wear
a
hat
though
it
seems
in
india
i
still
called
a
very
well
captain
hawksworth
the
no
turban
he
seemed
to
smile
as
he
turned
to
the
other
players
and
signaled
for
play
to
start
abul
hasan
team
is
composed
of
surat
officials
captain
you
will
notice
however
that
i
am
teamed
with
some
of
our
merchants
muslim
of
course
not
hindus
something
i
must
do
to
ensure
challenging
opponents
the
mere
presence
of
merchants
here
today
should
give
you
some
idea
how
very
tedious
i
find
living
in
surat
in
agra
no
merchant
would
be
allowed
near
a
but
here
my
officials
enjoy
winning
their
money
so
much
that
i
am
forced
to
relent
and
he
laughed
warmly
the
burning
ball
was
slammed
toward
the
middle
of
the
field
and
the
players
spurred
their
horses
after
it
in
lunging
pursuit
hawksworth
gripped
the
stick
in
his
right
hand
and
the
reins
in
the
other
as
his
mount
galloped
after
the
others
obviously
eager
to
begin
the
red
turbans
reached
the
ball
first
with
the
governor
in
the
lead
he
caught
the
ball
on
a
bounce
and
wielding
his
stick
in
a
graceful
arc
whipped
it
under
the
neck
of
the
dark
stallion
and
directly
toward
the
while
in
the
same
motion
reining
in
his
mount
sharply
to
follow
its
trajectory
but
a
white
turban
had
anticipated
his
shot
and
was
already
in
position
to
intercept
the
ball
he
cut
directly
in
front
of
the
governor
path
and
with
a
practiced
swipe
bulleted
the
ball
back
toward
the
center
of
the
field
knocking
a
spray
of
sparks
across
the
face
of
the
horse
mukarrab
khan
stallion
seemed
scarcely
to
notice
as
he
reared
whirled
and
flew
in
chase
the
shot
had
passed
over
the
heads
of
the
three
other
white
turbans
and
bounced
off
the
grass
a
few
feet
behind
hawksworth
still
well
to
the
rear
hawksworth
reined
his
mount
about
and
bore
down
on
the
ball
beginning
to
feel
some
of
the
exhilaration
of
the
play
he
reached
the
ball
on
its
second
bounce
and
with
a
rigid
arc
of
his
arm
swung
the
the
impact
recoiled
a
dizzying
shock
through
the
wood
and
up
his
right
shoulder
he
dimly
heard
the
cheers
of
his
teammates
seeming
to
congratulate
him
on
his
stroke
but
where
the
ball
he
wondered
as
he
scanned
the
darkened
empty
expanse
down
the
field
then
he
realized
he
had
only
deflected
it
back
toward
the
three
white
turbans
in
the
center
of
the
field
the
last
white
turban
in
the
row
snared
the
ball
with
his
stick
deflecting
it
again
but
now
in
the
direction
of
the
reds
dust
was
boiling
from
the
surface
of
the
field
increasingly
obscuring
the
players
and
the
play
the
darkened
arena
had
become
a
jostling
mob
friend
scarcely
distinguishable
from
foe
and
all
in
pursuit
of
the
only
certain
object
the
ball
hawksworth
eyes
seared
and
his
throat
choked
as
he
raced
after
the
others
always
it
seemed
bringing
up
the
rear
while
his
mount
took
her
head
and
rarely
acknowledged
his
awkward
attempts
to
command
he
clung
to
the
iron
ring
of
his
saddle
content
merely
to
stay
astride
give
me
a
quarterdeck
any
day
the
red
turbans
again
had
command
of
the
ball
and
hawksworth
watched
as
the
governor
now
raced
to
the
lead
urged
on
by
his
teammates
he
snared
the
ball
effortlessly
and
with
a
powerful
swing
sent
it
arcing
back
toward
his
own
the
other
red
turbans
rushed
in
pursuit
but
a
white
turban
was
already
at
the
waiting
to
deflect
the
play
he
snared
the
ball
in
the
crook
of
his
stick
and
flung
it
back
toward
the
center
the
reds
seemed
to
anticipate
this
for
they
reined
as
one
man
and
dashed
back
but
now
a
white
had
control
and
he
guided
the
ball
alone
across
the
grassy
expanse
while
a
phalanx
of
other
whites
rode
guard
hawksworth
was
still
lagging
in
front
of
his
own
when
suddenly
he
saw
the
ball
lofting
toward
him
a
flaming
mortar
in
the
darkened
sky
it
slammed
to
earth
near
his
horse
flank
spewing
sparks
he
cut
his
mare
sharply
to
the
left
and
galloped
in
pursuit
above
the
shouts
he
only
dimly
heard
the
reds
thundering
behind
him
closing
in
as
he
reached
the
ball
and
caught
it
in
the
curve
of
his
stick
roll
it
he
told
himself
keep
it
on
the
ground
the
reds
were
on
him
in
what
seemed
a
swing
for
the
ball
abul
hasan
brought
his
stick
in
a
wide
arc
its
hardened
crook
accurately
intersecting
hawksworth
directly
in
the
middle
hawksworth
felt
an
uneven
shudder
pulse
through
his
arm
and
heard
his
own
stick
shatter
the
lower
half
flew
to
his
right
and
he
watched
in
dismay
as
it
sailed
across
the
path
of
mukarrab
khan
mount
just
as
the
governor
cut
inward
to
block
hawksworth
the
hard
wood
caught
the
dark
stallion
directly
across
its
front
shins
and
the
horse
stumbled
awkwardly
hawksworth
stared
at
horse
and
rider
dumbly
for
a
moment
as
the
stallion
lost
its
stride
and
he
suddenly
realized
the
governor
horse
would
fall
and
when
it
did
mukarrab
khan
would
be
thrown
directly
below
the
horses
thundering
behind
them
he
cut
his
mount
sharply
to
the
right
and
deliberately
slammed
into
the
governor
stallion
mukarrab
khan
dazed
eyes
flashed
understanding
and
he
stretched
for
the
center
ring
of
hawksworth
saddle
during
the
fractional
second
their
horses
were
in
collision
at
the
same
instant
he
disengaged
himself
from
his
own
stirrups
and
pulled
himself
across
the
neck
of
hawksworth
mare
two
alert
reds
pulled
their
mounts
alongside
hawksworth
and
grabbed
the
reins
of
his
mare
the
dark
stallion
collapsed
in
the
dust
behind
them
with
a
pitiful
neigh
then
it
rose
and
limped
painfully
toward
the
edge
of
the
field
its
left
foreleg
dangling
shattered
and
useless
mukarrab
khan
lowered
himself
to
the
ground
with
an
elaborate
oath
a
cheer
sounded
as
the
whites
scored
the
ball
unmolested
hawksworth
was
still
watching
the
governor
when
one
of
the
attendants
rushed
from
the
sidelines
seized
the
fragment
of
his
broken
stick
and
thrust
it
toward
him
the
silver
is
yours
to
keep
sahib
it
is
the
custom
that
one
whose
stick
is
broken
in
play
may
keep
its
silver
tip
as
a
token
of
bravery
for
you
it
is
especially
deserved
he
was
short
swarthy
and
dressed
in
a
covered
white
shirt
he
bowed
slightly
while
his
eyes
gleamed
their
admiration
in
the
darkness
take
it
captain
it
is
an
honor
abul
hasan
rode
up
stiffly
brushing
the
dust
from
the
mane
of
his
horse
no
to
my
knowledge
has
ever
before
attempted
and
certainly
none
has
earned
a
silver
knob
captain
hawksworth
you
rode
well
mukarrab
khan
had
commandeered
a
mount
and
also
drew
alongside
there
was
a
light
scratch
along
the
right
side
of
his
face
and
the
whimsical
look
had
vanished
from
his
eyes
as
he
searched
the
faces
clustered
around
a
very
curious
accident
it
has
never
happened
before
he
stared
directly
at
hawksworth
how
was
your
stick
broken
the
made
an
unfortunate
swing
excellency
abul
hasan
interjected
he
played
superbly
for
a
beginner
but
he
has
still
to
fully
master
the
stroke
obviously
but
he
compensated
by
his
luck
my
luck
in
saving
me
from
a
fall
he
rides
well
enough
no
matter
how
uncertain
his
stroke
the
governor
examined
them
both
skeptically
hawksworth
watched
the
exchange
in
incredulous
silence
the
may
be
covering
for
his
own
accident
or
perhaps
it
was
an
accident
and
if
not
then
he
tried
to
kill
the
mukarrab
khan
in
a
way
that
would
look
like
it
was
my
responsibility
i
still
maintain
it
was
most
curious
mukarrab
khan
turned
to
watch
as
the
prepared
to
shoot
his
favorite
horse
but
tell
me
now
what
you
think
of
captain
hawksworth
it
exhilarating
and
dangerous
a
seaman
might
say
it
like
taking
the
whipstaff
all
alone
in
a
gale
without
a
safety
line
hawksworth
tried
unsuccessfully
to
decipher
mukarrab
khan
thoughts
a
quaint
analogy
but
doubtless
apt
he
tried
to
smile
you
know
captain
there
are
those
who
mistakenly
regard
merely
a
game
whereas
it
is
actually
much
much
more
it
a
crucible
of
courage
it
sharpens
one
quickness
of
mind
tests
one
powers
of
decision
the
great
akman
believed
the
same
and
for
that
reason
he
encouraged
it
years
ago
among
his
officials
of
course
it
requires
horsemanship
but
in
the
last
count
it
a
flawless
test
of
manhood
you
did
not
entirely
disappoint
me
i
suspect
you
english
could
one
day
be
worthy
of
our
little
game
a
shot
rang
out
and
the
governor
face
went
pale
for
an
instant
his
eyes
glossed
with
sadness
then
he
turned
again
to
hawksworth
deplorable
waste
to
think
i
bought
him
just
last
year
especially
for
from
a
grasping
arab
a
confirmed
thief
who
sensed
i
fancied
that
stallion
and
absolutely
refused
to
bargain
the
voice
was
calmer
now
the
official
facade
returning
but
enough
perhaps
i
could
interest
you
in
a
drink
he
signaled
toward
the
edge
of
the
field
and
a
waiting
groom
ran
toward
them
bearing
a
black
clay
pot
with
a
long
spout
the
sun
has
set
ramadan
is
finished
for
this
year
so
i
will
join
you
let
me
show
you
how
we
drink
on
horseback
he
lifted
the
pot
above
his
head
tilted
the
spout
toward
him
and
caught
the
stream
effortlessly
in
his
mouth
then
he
passed
it
to
hawksworth
called
the
seem
to
like
it
and
mispronounce
it
the
water
was
sugar
sweet
and
tangy
with
bits
of
lemon
god
hawksworth
thought
would
we
had
barrels
of
this
for
the
voyage
home
as
he
drank
drenching
his
beard
he
first
noticed
the
icy
stars
a
splendor
of
cold
fire
in
an
overhead
canopy
the
town
smoke
had
been
banished
by
the
freshening
wind
and
a
placid
silence
now
mantled
the
field
the
players
were
preparing
to
leave
and
the
grooms
were
harnessing
the
remaining
horses
to
lead
them
home
tonight
we
feast
to
mark
the
end
of
ramadan
captain
our
month
of
fasting
during
daylight
hours
it
an
evening
celebrating
the
return
of
sensual
pleasure
mukarrab
khan
stared
at
hawksworth
for
a
moment
by
the
looks
of
you
i
suspect
you
no
jesuit
i
would
be
honored
if
you
could
join
me
he
forced
a
blithe
cheerfulness
his
weary
eyes
belied
as
hawksworth
listened
he
realized
he
very
much
wanted
to
go
to
lose
himself
for
a
time
and
suddenly
the
words
of
huyghen
and
of
roger
symmes
flashed
through
his
mind
of
the
india
you
would
not
want
to
leave
you
would
not
be
able
to
leave
they
rode
toward
the
town
mukarrab
khan
fell
silent
and
abul
hasan
too
seemed
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
hawksworth
slowly
let
his
horse
draw
to
the
rear
in
order
to
count
the
governor
personal
retinue
of
guards
thirty
men
with
quivers
of
arrows
beside
their
saddle
pikes
at
their
right
stirrup
and
a
matchlock
musket
as
they
rode
the
other
horsemen
eyed
hawksworth
warily
keeping
to
themselves
and
making
no
effort
to
talk
hawksworth
thought
he
sensed
an
underlying
hostility
lurking
through
the
crowd
but
whether
it
was
between
the
merchants
and
officials
or
toward
him
he
could
not
discern
then
a
presumptuous
thought
passed
through
his
mind
could
this
entire
scene
have
been
staged
by
mukarrab
khan
to
somehow
test
me
but
to
what
purpose
what
could
he
want
to
find
out
whatever
it
was
i
think
he
just
may
have
found
it
then
he
leaned
back
in
the
saddle
pushed
aside
his
misgivings
and
sampled
the
perfumed
evening
air
chapter
seven
they
were
deep
within
the
center
of
surat
nearing
the
river
when
suddenly
the
street
opened
onto
a
wide
plaza
the
first
thing
hawksworth
saw
through
the
torchlight
was
a
high
iron
fence
sentries
posted
with
bucklers
and
pikes
along
its
perimeter
and
an
ornate
iron
gate
then
as
they
neared
he
realized
the
fence
was
the
outer
perimeter
of
an
immense
pink
sandstone
fortress
with
high
turrets
and
a
wide
arched
entryway
finally
he
spotted
the
filled
moat
that
lay
between
the
fence
and
the
fortress
walls
the
moat
was
spanned
by
a
single
wooden
bridge
and
hawksworth
noted
that
when
the
bridge
was
drawn
inward
it
neatly
sealed
the
entry
of
the
fortress
as
they
approached
the
iron
outer
gate
the
party
of
began
to
disperse
after
formal
and
minimal
farewells
the
merchants
and
officials
turned
and
disappeared
into
the
night
soon
only
hawksworth
and
mukarrab
khan
were
left
together
with
the
governor
private
grooms
and
guards
hawksworth
studied
the
departing
players
with
curiosity
what
sway
does
mukarrab
khan
hold
over
them
respect
fear
then
the
iron
gate
swung
wide
and
their
horses
clattered
across
the
wooden
drawbridge
hawksworth
looked
about
and
began
to
understand
that
the
governor
palace
guards
were
not
merely
ceremonial
lining
both
sides
of
the
drawbridge
were
uniformed
infantrymen
armed
with
pikes
then
as
they
passed
under
the
stone
archway
leading
into
the
fortress
hawksworth
turned
to
see
even
more
armed
guards
poised
just
inside
pikes
in
formal
salute
and
farther
back
he
saw
two
armored
animals
gigantic
many
times
larger
than
the
biggest
horse
with
massive
ears
and
a
snout
several
feet
in
length
that
must
be
what
a
war
elephant
looks
like
so
they
really
do
exist
but
why
so
many
guards
it
virtually
a
private
army
then
he
felt
a
groom
tug
the
reins
of
his
horse
and
signal
for
him
to
dismount
they
were
now
inside
the
palace
grounds
ahead
through
an
intricate
formal
garden
stood
the
residence
of
the
governor
of
surat
the
elaborate
carvings
of
its
pink
sandstone
decoration
reflected
hard
red
in
the
torchlight
mukarrab
khan
directed
him
through
a
marble
entryway
ornately
rounded
at
the
top
like
the
turret
of
a
mosque
they
had
entered
some
form
of
reception
hallway
and
hawksworth
noticed
that
the
marble
floor
was
decorated
with
a
complex
geometry
of
colored
stone
above
his
head
were
galleries
of
white
plasterwork
supported
by
delicate
arches
and
along
the
sides
were
ornate
curtained
recesses
hanging
oil
lamps
brilliantly
illuminated
the
glistening
walls
while
rows
of
servants
dressed
in
matching
white
turbans
lined
the
sides
in
welcome
as
they
approached
the
end
of
the
reception
hallway
hawksworth
studied
the
door
ahead
it
was
massive
and
thick
enough
to
withstand
any
war
machine
that
could
be
brought
into
the
hallway
and
yet
its
protective
function
was
concealed
from
obvious
notice
by
a
decoration
of
intricate
carvings
and
a
flawless
polish
the
servants
slowly
revolved
it
outward
on
its
heavy
brass
hinges
and
mukarrab
khan
led
them
into
a
vast
open
courtyard
surrounded
by
a
veranda
with
columns
supporting
balconies
of
marble
filigree
it
seemed
a
vast
reception
hall
set
in
the
open
air
an
elegant
plaza
whose
roof
was
stars
and
whose
centerpiece
was
a
canopied
pavilion
under
which
stood
a
raised
couch
of
juniper
wood
lined
with
red
satin
not
unlike
an
english
bed
save
the
posts
were
delicately
thin
and
polished
to
a
burnished
ebony
large
bronze
lanterns
along
the
balconies
furnished
a
flickering
vision
of
the
complex
interworking
of
paths
flower
beds
and
fountains
surrounding
the
central
pavilion
waiting
on
the
veranda
just
inside
the
entryway
were
six
tall
figures
three
on
either
side
of
the
doorway
they
were
turbaned
exquisitely
robed
and
wore
conspicuous
jewels
that
gleamed
against
their
dark
skin
as
they
bowed
to
the
governor
hawksworth
examined
them
for
a
brief
moment
and
then
his
recognition
clicked
eunuchs
they
must
be
mukarrab
khan
private
guards
since
they
can
go
anywhere
even
the
women
apartments
captain
hawksworth
perhaps
you
should
meet
my
household
officials
they
are
bengalis
slaves
actually
whom
i
bought
young
and
trained
years
ago
in
agra
one
must
regrettably
employ
eunuchs
to
maintain
a
household
such
as
this
one
palace
women
can
never
be
trusted
and
one
intriguing
wives
least
of
all
i
named
them
in
the
arab
fashion
after
their
position
in
the
palace
so
i
need
not
trouble
to
remember
their
names
merely
what
they
do
this
is
nahir
who
is
in
charge
of
my
accounts
he
gestured
toward
a
pudgy
face
now
glaring
out
from
beneath
a
deep
blue
headdress
a
tall
conical
turban
tied
in
place
with
a
wrap
of
white
silk
that
circled
his
bloated
throat
the
eunuch
open
jacket
was
a
heavy
brocade
and
it
heaved
as
he
breathed
betraying
the
sagging
fat
around
his
nipples
the
one
next
to
him
selects
my
wardrobe
the
second
eunuch
gazed
at
hawksworth
impassively
his
puffed
indulgent
lips
red
with
betel
juice
that
one
selects
the
clothes
for
my
spendthrift
women
and
the
one
on
his
left
is
responsible
for
all
their
jewels
the
one
over
there
takes
care
of
the
household
linens
and
oversees
the
servants
and
the
one
behind
him
is
in
charge
of
the
kitchen
you
will
be
asked
to
endure
his
handiwork
tonight
the
eunuchs
examined
hawksworth
ragged
appearance
with
transparent
contempt
and
they
seemed
to
melt
around
him
as
he
walked
through
the
doorway
two
ahead
two
behind
and
one
on
either
side
none
spoke
a
greeting
hawksworth
examined
them
carefully
wondering
which
was
in
charge
of
the
women
apartments
that
the
most
powerful
position
he
smiled
to
himself
nothing
else
really
counts
a
servant
came
down
the
veranda
bearing
a
tray
and
brought
it
directly
to
the
governor
then
he
kneeled
and
offered
it
it
was
of
beaten
silver
and
on
it
were
two
large
crystal
goblets
of
a
pastel
green
liquid
captain
would
you
care
to
refresh
yourself
with
a
glass
of
it
the
traditional
way
we
break
the
fast
of
ramadan
he
directed
the
servant
toward
hawksworth
it
prepared
in
the
women
apartments
during
the
day
as
an
excuse
for
something
to
do
hawksworth
touched
the
drink
lightly
with
his
tongue
it
was
a
mixture
of
sweet
and
tang
quite
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
known
perhaps
the
closest
was
a
brisk
mug
of
spiced
ale
pungent
with
clove
and
cinnamon
but
this
spiced
drink
was
mysteriously
subtle
puzzling
he
turned
to
mukarrab
khan
what
is
this
it
tastes
like
the
air
in
a
garden
this
i
never
paid
any
notice
although
the
women
down
it
by
the
basinful
after
sunset
as
he
received
his
own
goblet
he
turned
to
one
of
the
eunuchs
nahir
how
do
the
women
prepare
with
seeds
khan
sahib
seeds
of
melons
cucumber
lettuce
and
coriander
are
pounded
and
then
blended
with
rosewater
pomegranate
essence
and
juice
of
the
aloe
flower
but
the
secret
is
to
strain
it
properly
and
i
find
i
must
carefully
oversee
the
work
doubtless
mukarrab
khan
voice
was
curt
i
suspect
you
should
attend
the
accounts
more
and
the
women
apartments
less
he
turned
to
another
eunuch
is
my
bath
ready
as
always
khan
sahib
as
the
eunuch
bowed
he
examined
face
and
hair
discreetly
will
the
distinguished
require
a
bath
he
was
on
the
this
afternoon
just
as
i
was
hawksworth
groaned
inwardly
what
english
host
would
have
the
effrontery
to
suggest
a
guest
needed
a
bath
for
that
matter
what
englishman
would
even
consider
bathing
more
than
twice
a
year
known
well
enough
king
james
never
bathes
that
he
never
even
washes
his
hands
only
brushes
them
with
a
moist
napkin
at
mealtime
yet
this
moor
wants
a
full
bath
before
a
meal
merely
to
remove
a
bit
of
dust
i
would
be
content
to
rinse
my
hands
mukarrab
khan
examined
him
for
a
moment
and
then
broke
into
a
wide
smile
i
always
forget
positively
afraid
of
water
he
spoke
quickly
to
one
of
the
eunuchs
who
turned
and
barked
orders
to
the
servants
in
a
language
hawksworth
did
not
understand
the
servants
will
provide
whatever
you
require
mukarrab
khan
bowed
perfunctorily
to
hawksworth
and
disappeared
through
one
of
the
arched
doorways
leading
off
the
courtyard
followed
by
the
eunuchs
then
hawksworth
turned
to
see
a
man
bearing
a
large
silver
basin
down
the
veranda
behind
him
a
second
man
carried
a
red
velvet
cushion
shaped
like
a
long
cylinder
and
placed
it
on
a
stool
next
to
the
canopied
pavilion
gesturing
for
hawksworth
to
sit
as
hawksworth
seated
himself
and
turned
toward
the
basin
the
servant
held
waiting
he
caught
the
fresh
aroma
of
a
full
bouquet
as
though
the
fragrances
of
some
tropic
eden
had
been
distilled
into
the
water
he
looked
down
to
see
flower
petals
floating
on
its
shimmering
covered
surface
how
curious
he
thought
english
countrywomen
sometimes
distill
toilet
water
from
the
flowers
in
their
gardens
but
never
in
such
it
can
be
used
merely
to
wash
hands
and
while
english
toilet
waters
are
cloying
and
sweet
violets
and
gilliflowers
this
aroma
is
light
and
delicate
war
elephants
and
perfumed
waters
in
the
same
palace
it
incredible
he
gingerly
splashed
his
hands
and
looked
up
to
find
a
steaming
towel
being
proffered
he
sponged
away
the
remaining
mud
of
the
playing
field
and
watched
as
one
by
one
the
servants
began
to
melt
into
the
darkened
recesses
of
the
marble
galleries
the
last
was
an
old
withered
gamekeeper
who
wandered
through
the
garden
berating
a
sullen
peacock
toward
its
roost
and
then
the
courtyard
fell
austerely
quiet
illuminated
now
only
by
lanterns
and
pale
moonlight
it
became
a
fairyland
almost
outside
of
time
he
smiled
as
he
thought
of
where
he
had
been
only
the
previous
night
fending
off
an
attack
by
portuguese
infantry
and
now
this
his
thoughts
began
to
drift
randomly
to
float
in
and
among
the
marble
latticework
of
the
veranda
and
he
thought
once
more
of
roger
symmes
and
his
bizarre
stories
of
india
he
was
right
it
a
heaven
on
earth
but
with
an
undertow
of
violence
just
beneath
the
serene
polished
surface
all
this
beauty
and
yet
it
guarded
with
war
elephants
and
a
moat
it
a
world
that
artificial
it
carved
of
marble
and
jewels
and
then
locked
away
now
i
beginning
to
understand
why
he
found
it
so
enticing
and
frightening
god
for
a
brandy
now
khan
sahib
awaits
you
hawksworth
looked
up
to
see
the
eunuch
standing
directly
in
front
of
him
freshly
attired
in
a
long
robe
of
patterned
silk
as
he
rose
startled
from
his
reveries
a
pudgy
hand
shot
out
and
seized
his
arm
your
sword
is
not
permitted
in
the
banquet
room
hawksworth
froze
then
he
remembered
the
knife
strapped
inside
the
top
of
his
boot
and
the
thought
gave
him
comfort
he
unbuckled
his
sword
slowly
deliberately
pausing
to
meet
the
eunuch
defiant
stare
as
he
passed
it
over
the
eunuch
seemed
to
ignore
hawksworth
look
as
he
continued
you
will
also
remove
your
boots
it
is
against
custom
to
wear
them
in
the
banquet
room
hawksworth
moved
to
protest
then
sadly
concluded
there
would
be
no
point
of
course
the
room
would
be
filled
with
carpets
and
that
must
be
the
reason
everyone
i
seen
here
wears
open
shoes
with
the
backs
folded
down
they
constantly
being
removed
at
doorways
he
bent
over
and
unbuckled
his
boots
the
eunuch
stiffened
momentarily
when
he
saw
the
glint
of
the
knife
handle
in
the
lamplight
but
he
said
nothing
merely
swept
up
the
boots
with
his
other
hand
as
they
walked
slowly
down
the
marble
hallway
toward
the
bronzed
door
of
the
banquet
room
hawksworth
tried
to
rehearse
what
he
would
say
to
mukarrab
khan
he
has
to
petition
the
court
in
agra
to
grant
safe
conduct
for
the
trip
he
just
has
to
send
one
letter
how
can
he
possibly
refuse
remember
you
an
ambassador
the
eunuch
shoved
wide
the
bronzed
door
and
hawksworth
was
astonished
by
what
he
saw
the
governor
of
surat
lounged
against
a
purple
velvet
bolster
at
the
far
end
of
a
long
room
whose
walls
were
a
cool
expanse
of
flawless
white
and
whose
marble
floor
was
softened
with
an
enormous
carpet
in
the
thick
persian
style
his
skin
glistened
with
light
oil
and
he
had
donned
a
fresh
turban
patterned
in
brown
and
white
tied
in
intricate
swirls
and
bound
with
a
strand
of
dark
jewels
a
single
large
pearl
hung
over
his
forehead
and
two
tassels
each
also
suspending
a
pearl
brushed
his
shoulders
he
wore
a
patterned
shirt
in
pale
brown
and
over
this
a
heavy
green
vest
lined
in
white
satin
and
embroidered
in
gold
it
was
bound
with
a
woven
cinch
decorated
with
brocade
around
his
neck
were
two
strings
of
pearls
the
shorter
suspending
a
large
ruby
from
its
center
he
had
put
on
heavy
bracelets
and
intricate
rings
circled
the
first
and
fourth
fingers
of
both
hands
hawksworth
also
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
he
wore
earrings
each
a
tiny
green
emerald
the
eunuchs
stood
behind
him
and
around
the
sides
of
the
room
servants
and
slaves
stood
waiting
along
a
back
wall
two
men
sat
silently
poised
one
behind
a
pair
of
small
drums
and
the
other
holding
an
ornate
stringed
instrument
its
polished
body
glistening
in
the
light
the
only
women
in
the
room
mingled
among
the
servers
captain
hawksworth
our
fare
tonight
will
be
simple
and
unworthy
but
please
honor
my
table
by
your
indulgence
mukarrab
khan
smiled
warmly
and
motioned
hawksworth
to
enter
at
least
we
can
talk
freely
is
this
an
official
meeting
hawksworth
did
not
move
but
stood
as
officiously
as
he
could
muster
if
you
wish
our
meeting
can
be
considered
formal
even
if
we
are
not
then
as
ambassador
of
his
majesty
king
james
of
england
i
must
insist
that
you
rise
to
receive
me
hawksworth
tried
to
suppress
the
feeling
that
he
looked
vaguely
foolish
as
a
barefoot
ambassador
but
no
one
else
in
the
room
wore
shoes
either
a
governor
is
still
his
subject
i
represent
my
king
person
i
was
not
informed
you
were
an
ambassador
mukarrab
khan
face
sobered
noticeably
but
he
did
not
move
you
are
of
two
merchant
vessels
i
here
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
england
with
authority
to
speak
for
him
in
all
matters
regarding
trade
hawksworth
recalled
the
effect
this
had
had
on
the
shahbandar
i
entrusted
with
his
personal
letter
to
the
moghul
mukarrab
khan
examined
hawksworth
for
a
long
moment
seeming
to
collect
and
assemble
a
number
of
thoughts
your
request
would
be
proper
for
an
ambassador
let
us
say
i
comply
in
the
interest
of
mutual
good
will
he
rose
and
bowed
formally
if
only
sightly
more
a
nod
the
governor
of
surat
welcomes
you
a
representative
of
the
english
king
and
i
convey
my
king
acknowledgement
of
your
welcome
hawksworth
entered
and
seated
himself
facing
mukarrab
khan
against
a
large
velvet
bolster
already
positioned
for
him
and
what
is
this
letter
your
english
king
sends
to
his
majesty
mukarrab
khan
reclined
back
on
his
own
bolster
and
arched
his
fingertips
together
that
is
a
concern
between
king
james
and
the
moghul
hawksworth
caught
the
quickly
suppressed
flash
of
anger
in
mukarrab
khan
eyes
i
only
ask
that
you
petition
the
court
in
agra
for
permission
to
travel
there
it
would
also
be
helpful
if
you
would
order
the
shahbandar
to
allow
our
merchants
to
trade
their
goods
at
the
port
of
surat
yes
i
understand
you
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
our
shahbandar
i
regret
deeply
having
to
tell
you
i
have
virtually
no
influence
over
that
notorious
man
he
was
appointed
by
the
moghul
son
prince
jadar
who
is
in
charge
of
administering
this
province
he
acts
very
much
as
he
pleases
lie
number
one
hawksworth
thought
you
forced
him
to
order
my
transfer
here
surely
you
aware
mukarrab
khan
continued
evenly
that
no
other
europeans
besides
the
portuguese
have
ever
before
landed
cargo
on
the
shores
of
india
arabs
persians
even
turks
are
a
common
sight
but
no
other
europeans
not
even
your
dutch
who
i
told
consort
with
some
of
our
southeastern
neighbors
in
fact
the
moghul
trade
agreement
with
the
portuguese
is
intended
to
exclude
all
other
europeans
mukarrab
khan
stirred
on
his
bolster
and
signaled
one
of
the
eunuchs
to
prepare
the
carpet
for
dining
although
frankly
he
has
little
choice
since
they
control
the
seas
in
fact
it
might
be
said
that
they
allow
our
merchants
to
trade
indian
cargo
vessels
must
all
acquire
a
license
from
portuguese
officials
in
goa
before
leaving
port
the
portugals
control
india
trade
because
you
allowed
them
to
your
territorial
waters
belong
to
india
or
should
mukarrab
khan
seemed
to
ignore
hawksworth
as
he
watched
the
servants
spread
a
large
covering
of
tooled
leather
across
the
carpet
in
front
of
them
after
a
moment
his
concentration
reappeared
and
he
turned
abruptly
ambassador
hawksworth
we
do
not
need
to
be
advised
by
you
how
india
should
manage
her
own
affairs
but
perhaps
i
will
advise
you
that
his
excellency
the
portuguese
viceroy
has
already
sent
notice
by
messenger
that
he
intends
to
lodge
charges
of
piracy
against
your
two
ships
he
has
requested
that
they
be
confiscated
and
that
you
your
merchants
and
your
crews
be
transferred
to
goa
for
trial
hawksworth
heart
stopped
and
he
examined
mukarrab
khan
in
dismay
so
the
had
merely
been
an
excuse
to
take
him
into
confinement
after
a
moment
he
stiffened
and
drew
himself
erect
and
i
say
the
portugals
were
the
ones
acting
as
pirates
their
attack
on
our
english
merchantmen
was
in
violation
of
the
treaty
of
peace
that
now
exists
between
england
and
spain
and
by
extension
to
the
craven
portugals
who
are
now
nothing
more
than
a
vassal
of
the
spanish
king
yes
i
heard
rumors
of
this
treaty
we
in
india
are
not
entirely
ignorant
of
europe
but
his
excellency
denies
there
any
such
treaty
extending
to
our
shores
as
i
recall
he
characterized
england
as
an
island
of
stinking
fishermen
who
should
remain
content
to
fish
their
own
sea
the
treaty
between
england
and
spain
exists
hawksworth
decided
to
ignore
the
insult
we
have
exchanged
ambassadors
and
it
is
honored
by
both
our
kings
it
ended
almost
two
decades
of
war
i
will
grant
you
such
a
treaty
may
indeed
exist
whether
it
applies
here
i
do
not
know
nor
frankly
do
i
particularly
care
what
i
do
know
english
ambassador
is
that
you
are
very
far
from
the
law
courts
of
europe
the
portuguese
still
control
the
seas
off
india
as
they
have
done
for
a
hundred
years
and
unenforceable
treaties
have
little
bearing
on
the
rule
of
might
we
showed
you
the
of
the
portugals
yesterday
mukarrab
khan
laughed
heartily
and
when
he
glanced
toward
his
eunuchs
they
returned
obsequious
grins
you
are
truly
more
naive
than
i
ever
imagined
english
captain
hawksworth
what
effect
can
one
small
engagement
have
on
the
fleet
of
warships
at
goa
if
you
want
protection
at
sea
you
will
have
to
provide
it
yourself
is
that
what
your
king
hopes
to
gain
from
the
moghul
or
from
me
i
told
you
i
have
only
two
requests
one
is
your
message
to
agra
requesting
permission
for
my
journey
the
other
is
your
approval
to
trade
the
cargo
we
brought
yes
so
you
have
said
unfortunately
what
you
ask
may
not
be
all
that
easy
to
grant
your
unhappy
engagement
with
the
portuguese
fleet
has
made
my
situation
more
than
a
trifle
awkward
he
leaned
back
and
spoke
rapidly
in
persian
to
the
eunuchs
standing
behind
him
then
he
turned
back
to
hawksworth
but
as
one
of
our
agra
poets
a
sufi
rascal
named
samad
once
penned
the
thread
of
life
is
all
too
short
the
soul
tastes
wine
and
passes
on
before
we
explore
these
tiresome
concerns
further
let
us
taste
some
wine
the
eunuchs
were
already
dictating
orders
to
the
servants
a
silver
chalice
of
fresh
fruit
appeared
beside
hawksworth
brimming
with
mangoes
oranges
larger
than
he
had
ever
before
seen
slices
of
melon
and
other
unknown
fruits
of
varied
colors
a
similar
bowl
was
placed
beside
mukarrab
khan
who
seemed
to
ignore
it
then
as
hawksworth
watched
the
servants
began
spreading
a
white
linen
cloth
over
the
red
leather
coverlet
that
had
been
placed
on
the
carpet
in
front
of
them
a
host
is
expected
ambassador
to
apologize
for
the
meal
he
offers
i
will
take
the
occasion
to
do
that
now
mukarrab
khan
flashed
a
sprightly
smile
but
perhaps
after
your
months
at
sea
you
will
be
lenient
for
my
own
part
i
have
fasted
today
and
there
an
arab
proverb
that
hunger
is
the
best
spice
still
i
prefer
leisurely
gratification
i
concur
with
our
hindu
sensualists
that
pleasure
prolonged
is
pleasure
enhanced
all
pleasure
perhaps
this
evening
you
will
see
their
wisdom
before
hawksworth
could
respond
two
heavy
doors
at
the
back
of
the
room
slowly
opened
glinting
the
lamplight
off
their
elaborate
filigree
of
gold
and
bronze
and
the
first
trays
appeared
covered
with
silver
lids
and
borne
by
young
men
from
the
kitchen
uniformed
servants
preceded
them
into
the
room
one
by
one
the
trays
were
passed
to
the
eunuchs
who
removed
their
lids
and
carefully
inspected
the
contents
of
each
dish
after
a
brief
consultation
the
eunuchs
ordered
several
of
the
dishes
returned
to
the
kitchen
hawksworth
suddenly
realized
he
was
ravenous
and
he
watched
the
departing
dishes
in
dismay
did
they
somehow
fail
the
eunuchs
exacting
standards
sweet
jesus
who
cares
it
all
looks
delicious
after
final
approval
by
the
eunuchs
the
silver
serving
bowls
were
passed
to
servants
waiting
along
the
sides
of
the
room
who
in
turn
arrayed
them
across
the
linen
cloth
between
hawksworth
and
mukarrab
khan
a
chief
server
then
knelt
behind
the
dishes
while
several
stacks
of
porcelain
plates
were
placed
next
to
him
hawksworth
tried
to
count
the
silver
serving
bowls
but
stopped
after
twenty
one
by
one
the
server
ceremoniously
removed
the
silver
lids
from
the
bowls
beneath
them
the
contents
of
the
dishes
had
been
arrayed
in
the
colors
of
a
rainbow
on
beds
of
rice
that
ranged
from
white
to
saffron
to
green
and
even
purple
was
an
overwhelming
array
of
meats
fish
and
birds
of
all
sizes
there
were
carved
baked
fruits
tiny
balls
of
meat
flaked
with
spice
and
coconut
fried
vegetables
surrounded
by
silver
cups
of
a
pastel
green
sauce
large
flat
fish
encased
in
dark
baking
shells
flecked
with
red
and
green
spices
and
a
virtual
aviary
of
wild
fowl
from
small
game
birds
to
plump
pea
hens
the
server
dished
hearty
helpings
from
each
bowl
onto
separate
porcelain
plates
together
with
mounds
of
almond
rice
and
jellied
fruits
as
he
started
to
pass
the
first
plate
to
hawksworth
mukarrab
khan
roughly
arrested
his
hand
this
kitchen
will
serve
in
the
stables
after
tonight
he
seized
the
serving
spoons
and
with
a
flourish
of
traditional
moghul
etiquette
personally
laded
extra
portions
from
each
of
the
dishes
onto
hawksworth
plates
the
server
beamed
a
knowing
smile
hawksworth
stared
at
the
food
for
a
moment
dazzled
and
then
he
gingerly
sampled
a
meatball
the
taste
was
delicious
yet
hardy
and
he
caught
the
musky
flavor
of
lamb
lightened
and
transmuted
by
a
bouquet
of
spice
he
next
pulled
away
the
side
of
a
fish
and
wolfed
it
before
realizing
the
red
and
green
flecks
on
its
surface
were
some
incendiary
garnish
he
surveyed
the
room
in
agony
praying
for
a
mug
of
ale
till
an
alert
eunuch
signaled
a
servant
to
pass
a
dish
of
yogurt
to
his
amazement
the
tangy
ice
cold
liquid
seemed
to
instantly
dissolve
the
fire
on
his
tongue
he
plunged
back
into
the
dishes
he
had
never
eaten
like
this
before
even
in
england
he
suddenly
recalled
with
a
smile
an
episode
six
months
into
the
voyage
after
zanzibar
when
he
had
become
so
weary
of
stale
salt
pork
and
biscuit
he
thought
he
could
not
bear
to
see
it
again
he
had
locked
the
door
of
the
great
cabin
and
composed
a
full
english
banquet
in
his
mind
roast
capon
next
a
pigeon
pie
larded
in
bacon
fat
then
a
dripping
red
side
of
roast
mutton
followed
by
oysters
on
the
shell
spiced
with
grilled
eel
and
finally
a
thick
goose
pudding
on
honeyed
ham
and
to
wash
it
down
a
bottle
of
sack
to
begin
and
a
sweet
muscadel
mulled
even
sweeter
with
sugar
to
end
but
this
no
luscious
pork
fat
and
not
nearly
cloying
enough
for
a
true
englishman
yet
it
worked
poetry
symmes
was
right
this
was
heaven
with
both
hands
he
ripped
the
leg
off
a
huge
bird
that
had
been
basted
to
a
glistening
red
and
to
the
visible
horror
of
the
server
dipped
it
directly
into
one
of
the
silver
bowls
of
saffron
sauce
meant
for
pigeon
eggs
hawksworth
looked
up
in
time
to
catch
the
server
look
does
he
think
i
do
like
the
food
to
demonstrate
appreciation
he
hoisted
a
goblet
of
wine
to
toast
the
server
while
he
stretched
for
a
piece
of
lamb
with
his
other
hand
but
instead
of
acknowledging
the
compliment
the
server
went
pale
it
customary
ambassador
to
use
only
one
right
hand
when
eating
mukarrab
khan
forced
a
polite
smile
the
left
is
normally
reserved
for
attending
to
other
functions
hawksworth
then
noticed
how
mukarrab
khan
was
dining
he
too
ate
with
his
fingers
just
as
you
would
in
england
but
somehow
he
managed
to
lift
his
food
gracefully
with
balls
of
rice
the
sauce
never
soiling
his
fingertips
a
breeze
lightly
touched
hawksworth
cheek
and
he
turned
to
see
a
servant
standing
behind
him
banishing
the
occasional
fly
with
a
large
whisk
fashioned
from
stiff
horsehair
attached
to
a
long
stick
another
servant
stood
opposite
politely
but
unnecessarily
cooling
him
with
a
large
fan
made
of
red
leather
stretched
over
a
frame
as
i
said
ambassador
your
requests
present
a
number
of
difficulties
mukarrab
khan
looked
up
and
took
a
goblet
of
fruit
nectar
from
a
waiting
servant
you
ask
certain
things
from
me
things
not
entirely
in
my
power
to
grant
while
there
are
others
who
make
entirely
different
requests
you
mean
the
portugals
yes
the
portuguese
viceroy
who
maintains
you
have
acted
illegally
in
violation
of
his
law
and
ours
and
should
be
brought
to
account
and
i
accuse
them
of
acting
illegally
as
i
told
you
there
been
a
spanish
ambassador
in
london
ever
since
the
war
ended
and
when
we
return
i
assure
you
the
east
india
company
will
this
is
india
captain
hawksworth
not
london
please
understand
i
must
consider
portuguese
demands
but
we
are
pragmatic
i
urge
you
to
tell
me
a
bit
more
about
your
king
intentions
your
king
letter
surely
you
must
know
what
it
contains
mukarrab
khan
paused
to
dip
a
fried
mango
into
a
shimmering
orange
sauce
asking
himself
what
he
should
do
he
had
of
course
posted
pigeons
to
agra
at
sunrise
but
he
suspected
already
what
the
reply
would
be
he
had
received
a
full
account
of
the
battle
and
the
attack
on
the
river
before
the
early
ramadan
meal
and
it
was
only
shortly
afterward
that
father
manoel
pinheiro
had
appeared
frantic
and
bathed
in
sweat
was
it
a
sign
of
portuguese
contempt
he
often
wondered
that
they
would
assign
such
an
incompetent
to
india
throughout
their
entire
society
of
jesus
could
there
possibly
be
any
priest
more
the
jesuit
had
repeated
facts
already
known
throughout
the
palace
and
mukarrab
khan
had
listened
politely
masking
his
amusement
how
often
did
a
smug
portuguese
find
himself
explaining
a
naval
disaster
four
portuguese
warships
galleons
with
two
gundecks
humiliated
by
two
small
english
frigates
how
mukarrab
khan
had
wondered
aloud
could
this
have
happened
there
were
reasons
excellency
we
have
learned
the
english
captain
fired
langrel
into
our
infantry
shredded
metal
a
most
flagrant
violation
of
the
unwritten
ethics
of
warfare
are
there
really
supposed
to
be
ethics
in
warfare
then
i
suppose
you
should
have
sent
only
two
of
your
warships
against
him
instead
you
sent
four
and
still
he
prevailed
today
he
has
no
need
for
excuses
and
tell
me
again
what
happened
when
your
infantry
assaulted
the
english
traders
on
the
river
mukarrab
khan
had
monitored
the
eyes
in
secret
glee
watching
him
mentally
writhe
in
humiliation
am
i
to
understand
you
could
not
even
capture
a
pinnace
no
one
knows
excellency
the
men
sent
apparently
disappeared
without
a
trace
perhaps
the
english
had
set
a
trap
father
pinheiro
had
swabbed
his
greasy
brow
with
the
sleeve
of
his
cassock
his
dark
eyes
showed
none
of
the
haughty
disdain
he
usually
brought
to
their
meetings
i
would
ask
you
not
to
speak
of
it
outside
the
palace
it
was
after
all
a
special
mission
you
would
prefer
the
court
in
agra
not
know
there
is
no
reason
to
trouble
the
moghul
excellency
the
jesuit
paused
carefully
or
her
majesty
the
queen
this
really
concerns
the
viceroy
alone
the
jesuit
persian
was
grammatically
flawless
if
heavily
accented
and
he
awkwardly
tried
to
leaven
it
with
the
polite
complexities
he
had
been
taught
in
goa
still
less
is
there
any
need
for
prince
jadar
to
know
as
you
wish
mukarrab
khan
had
nodded
gravely
knowing
the
news
had
already
reached
half
of
india
and
most
certainly
prince
jadar
how
then
may
i
assist
the
english
pirate
and
his
merchants
must
be
delayed
here
at
least
four
weeks
until
the
fleet
of
galleons
now
unlading
in
goa
those
of
the
spring
voyage
just
arrived
from
lisbon
can
be
outfitted
to
meet
him
but
surely
he
and
his
merchants
will
sail
when
they
choose
and
sooner
if
we
deny
them
trade
do
you
suggest
that
i
approve
this
trade
you
must
act
as
you
see
fit
excellency
you
know
the
viceroy
has
always
been
of
service
to
queen
janahara
pinheiro
had
paused
slyly
just
as
you
have
been
the
cynicism
of
pinheiro
flaunting
his
knowledge
had
galled
mukarrab
khan
most
of
all
if
this
jesuit
knew
who
else
must
know
that
the
governor
of
surat
was
bound
inescapably
to
the
queen
that
on
any
matter
involving
portuguese
trade
he
must
always
send
a
formal
message
to
the
moghul
and
a
secret
one
to
the
queen
and
then
wait
while
she
dictated
the
ruling
arangbar
would
give
did
this
jesuit
know
also
why
mukarrab
khan
had
been
exiled
from
agra
to
the
wilderness
of
provincial
surat
that
it
was
on
orders
of
the
queen
to
marry
and
take
with
him
a
woman
becoming
dangerous
the
of
the
moghul
before
the
woman
influence
outweighed
that
even
of
janahara
and
now
this
female
viper
was
in
his
palace
forever
could
not
be
removed
or
divorced
because
she
was
still
a
favorite
of
the
moghul
so
you
tell
me
i
must
make
them
rich
before
you
can
destroy
them
that
seems
to
be
christian
wisdom
at
its
most
incisive
mukarrab
khan
had
summoned
a
tray
of
rolled
betel
leaves
signifying
that
the
interview
was
ended
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
see
you
father
you
will
have
my
reply
when
allah
wills
the
jesuit
had
departed
as
awkwardly
as
he
had
come
and
it
was
then
that
mukarrab
khan
decided
to
meet
the
englishman
for
himself
while
there
was
still
time
how
long
he
wondered
before
the
shahbandar
realized
the
obvious
and
the
prince
in
the
banquet
room
the
air
was
now
dense
with
the
aroma
of
spice
hawksworth
realized
he
had
so
gorged
he
could
scarcely
breathe
and
he
was
having
increasing
difficulty
deflecting
mukarrab
khan
probing
questions
the
governor
was
skillfully
angling
for
information
he
properly
did
not
need
and
he
did
not
seem
a
man
given
to
aimless
curiosity
what
do
you
mean
when
you
ask
about
the
of
england
if
the
moghul
should
approve
a
trade
agreement
with
your
east
india
company
what
volume
of
goods
would
you
bring
through
our
port
here
in
surat
mukarrab
khan
smiled
disarmingly
is
the
company
fleet
extensive
that
a
matter
better
addressed
to
the
merchants
of
the
company
hawksworth
monitored
mukarrab
khan
expression
searching
for
a
clue
to
his
thoughts
right
now
the
company
merely
wishes
to
trade
the
goods
in
our
two
merchantmen
english
wool
for
indian
cotton
yes
i
am
aware
that
was
the
first
of
your
two
requests
mukarrab
khan
motioned
away
the
silver
trays
incidentally
i
hope
you
are
fond
of
lamb
the
bronzed
doors
opened
again
and
a
single
large
tray
was
borne
in
by
the
unsmiling
servants
it
supported
a
huge
cooking
vessel
still
steaming
from
the
oven
the
lid
was
decorated
with
lifelike
silver
castings
of
various
birds
and
animals
after
two
eunuchs
examined
it
the
servants
delivered
it
to
the
center
of
the
linen
serving
cloth
tonight
to
signify
the
end
of
ramadan
i
instructed
my
cooks
to
prepare
my
special
biryani
i
hope
you
will
not
be
disappointed
my
kitchen
here
is
scandalous
by
agra
standards
but
i
succeeded
in
teaching
them
a
few
things
the
lid
was
lifted
from
the
pot
and
a
bouquet
of
saffron
burst
over
the
room
inside
covering
a
flawless
white
crust
was
a
second
menagerie
of
birds
and
animals
wrought
from
silver
the
thinness
of
paper
the
server
spooned
impossible
portions
from
the
pot
onto
silver
plates
one
for
hawksworth
and
one
for
mukarrab
khan
the
menagerie
was
distributed
around
the
sides
of
each
plate
actually
i
once
bribed
a
cook
in
the
moghul
own
kitchen
to
give
me
this
recipe
you
will
taste
nothing
like
it
here
in
surat
hawksworth
watched
as
he
assembled
a
ball
of
the
melange
with
his
fingers
and
reverently
popped
it
into
his
mouth
please
try
it
ambassador
i
think
you
find
it
remarkable
it
requires
the
preparation
of
two
sauces
and
seems
to
occupy
half
my
incompetent
kitchen
staff
the
governor
smiled
appreciatively
hawksworth
watched
dumbfounded
as
he
next
chewed
up
and
swallowed
one
of
the
animals
hawksworth
tried
to
construct
a
ball
of
the
mixture
but
finally
despaired
and
simply
scooped
up
a
handful
it
was
rich
but
light
and
seemed
to
hint
of
every
spice
in
the
indies
there
are
times
mukarrab
khan
continued
when
i
positively
yearn
for
the
deprivation
of
ramadan
when
the
appetite
is
whetted
day
long
the
nightly
indulgence
is
all
the
more
gratifying
hawksworth
took
another
mouthful
of
the
savory
mixture
after
the
many
long
months
of
salt
meat
and
biscuit
he
found
his
taste
confused
and
overwhelmed
by
its
complexity
its
spices
were
all
assertive
yet
he
could
not
specifically
identify
a
single
one
they
had
been
blended
it
seemed
to
enhance
one
another
to
create
a
pattern
from
many
parts
much
as
the
marble
inlays
of
the
floor
in
which
there
were
many
colors
yet
the
overall
effect
was
that
of
a
single
design
not
its
components
i
never
tasted
anything
quite
like
this
even
in
the
levant
could
you
prepare
instructions
for
our
ship
cook
it
would
be
my
pleasure
ambassador
but
i
doubt
very
much
a
cook
could
reproduce
this
dish
it
far
too
complex
first
my
kitchen
prepares
a
masala
a
blend
of
nuts
and
spices
such
as
almonds
turmeric
and
ginger
the
bits
of
lamb
are
cooked
in
this
and
in
ghee
which
we
make
by
boiling
and
clarifying
butter
next
a
second
sauce
is
prepared
this
a
lighter
mixture
curds
seasoned
with
mint
clove
and
many
other
spices
i
sure
you
know
nothing
of
this
is
blended
with
the
lamb
and
then
layered
in
the
pot
you
see
there
together
with
rice
cooked
in
milk
and
saffron
finally
it
covered
with
a
crust
of
wheat
flour
and
baked
in
a
special
clay
oven
is
this
really
something
a
ship
cook
could
do
hawksworth
smiled
resignedly
and
took
another
mouthful
whoever
thought
there
could
be
so
many
uses
for
spice
we
use
spice
in
england
to
be
sure
clove
cinnamon
pepper
even
ginger
and
cardamom
but
they
intended
mainly
to
disguise
the
taste
of
meat
past
its
prime
but
here
spices
are
essential
ingredients
let
us
return
to
your
requests
captain
hawksworth
i
afraid
neither
of
these
is
entirely
within
my
power
to
bestow
in
the
matter
of
trading
privileges
for
your
cargo
i
see
what
can
be
done
yours
is
an
unusual
request
in
the
sense
that
no
europeans
have
ever
come
here
to
war
with
the
portuguese
then
asked
to
compete
with
them
in
trade
it
seems
simple
enough
we
merely
exchange
our
goods
for
some
of
the
cotton
cloth
i
saw
arriving
at
the
customs
house
this
morning
the
shahbandar
stated
you
have
the
power
to
authorize
this
trade
yes
i
enjoy
some
modest
influence
and
i
really
do
expect
that
prince
jadar
would
object
he
the
moghul
son
correct
he
has
full
authority
over
this
province
but
he
frequently
on
campaign
and
difficult
to
reach
his
other
duties
include
responsibility
for
military
conscription
here
and
maintaining
order
these
are
somewhat
uneasy
times
especially
in
the
deccan
southeast
of
here
when
will
we
learn
your
decision
or
his
decision
there
are
other
markets
for
our
goods
you
will
learn
his
decision
when
it
is
decided
mukarrab
khan
shoved
aside
his
plate
and
a
servant
whisked
it
from
the
carpet
concerning
your
second
request
that
i
petition
agra
to
authorize
your
travel
there
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
but
it
will
require
time
i
would
ask
the
request
be
sent
immediately
naturally
mukarrab
khan
watched
absently
as
more
brimming
trays
were
brought
in
these
piled
with
candied
fruits
and
sweetmeats
a
hookah
water
pipe
appeared
and
was
placed
beside
hawksworth
do
you
enjoy
the
new
of
smoking
tobacco
captain
hawksworth
it
was
introduced
recently
and
already
it
become
fashionable
so
much
so
the
moghul
just
issued
a
decree
denouncing
it
king
james
has
denounced
it
too
claiming
it
destroys
health
but
also
the
fashion
in
london
personally
i
think
it
ruins
the
taste
of
brandy
and
wine
overall
i
inclined
to
agree
but
tell
me
now
what
your
opinion
of
the
wine
you
drinking
it
persian
better
than
the
french
though
frankly
it
could
be
sweeter
mukarrab
khan
laughed
a
common
complaint
from
some
actually
add
sugar
to
our
wine
abominable
he
paused
so
i
gather
then
you
only
use
spirits
what
do
you
mean
there
are
many
subtle
pleasures
in
the
world
ambassador
liquors
admittedly
enhance
one
dining
but
they
do
little
for
appreciation
of
art
as
hawksworth
watched
him
puzzling
he
turned
and
spoke
quietly
to
one
of
the
eunuchs
hovering
behind
him
moments
later
a
small
golden
cabinet
encrusted
with
jewels
was
placed
between
them
mukarrab
khan
opened
a
tiny
drawer
on
the
side
of
the
box
and
extraced
a
small
brown
ball
may
i
suggest
a
ball
of
he
offered
it
to
hawksworth
it
carried
a
strange
alien
fragrance
what
a
preparation
of
opium
and
spice
ambassador
i
think
it
might
help
you
better
experience
this
evening
entertainment
he
nodded
lightly
in
the
direction
of
the
rear
wall
the
snap
of
a
drum
exploded
behind
hawksworth
and
he
whirled
to
see
the
two
musicians
begin
tuning
to
perform
the
drummer
sat
before
two
drums
each
nestled
in
a
circular
roll
of
fabric
next
to
him
was
a
wizened
old
man
in
a
black
muslim
skullcap
tuning
a
large
stringed
instrument
made
of
two
gourds
both
lacquered
and
polished
connected
by
a
long
teakwood
fingerboard
about
a
dozen
curved
brass
frets
were
tied
to
the
fingerboard
with
silk
cords
and
as
hawksworth
watched
the
player
began
shifting
the
location
of
two
frets
sliding
them
an
inch
or
so
along
the
neck
to
create
a
new
musical
scale
then
he
began
adjusting
the
tension
on
a
row
of
fine
wires
that
lay
directly
against
the
teakwood
fingerboard
sympathetic
strings
that
passed
beneath
those
to
be
plucked
these
he
seemed
to
be
tuning
to
match
the
notes
in
the
new
scale
he
had
created
by
moving
the
frets
when
the
sitarist
had
completed
his
tuning
he
settled
back
and
the
room
fell
totally
silent
he
paused
a
moment
as
though
in
meditation
then
struck
the
first
note
of
a
somber
melody
hawksworth
at
first
found
almost
totally
rootless
using
a
wire
plectrum
attached
to
his
right
forefinger
he
seemed
to
be
waving
sounds
from
the
air
above
the
fingerboard
a
note
would
shimmer
into
existence
from
some
undefined
starting
point
then
glide
through
the
scale
via
a
subtle
arabesque
as
he
stretched
the
playing
string
diagonally
against
a
fret
manipulating
its
tension
finally
the
sound
would
dissolve
meltingly
into
its
own
silence
each
note
of
the
alien
melody
if
melody
it
could
be
called
was
first
lovingly
explored
for
its
own
character
approached
from
both
above
and
below
as
though
a
glistening
prize
on
display
only
after
the
note
was
suitably
embroidered
was
it
allowed
to
enter
the
melody
as
though
the
song
were
a
necklace
that
had
to
be
strung
one
pearl
at
a
time
and
only
after
each
pearl
had
been
carefully
polished
the
tension
of
some
vague
melodic
quest
began
to
grow
with
no
hint
of
a
resolution
in
the
emotional
intensity
of
his
haunting
search
the
passage
of
time
had
suddenly
ceased
to
exist
finally
as
though
satisifed
with
his
chosen
scale
he
returned
to
the
very
first
note
he
had
started
from
and
actually
began
a
song
deftly
tying
together
the
musical
strands
he
had
so
painstakingly
evolved
the
resolution
had
never
come
only
the
sense
that
the
first
note
was
the
one
he
had
been
looking
for
the
entire
time
this
must
be
the
mystical
music
symmes
spoke
of
hawksworth
thought
and
he
was
right
it
unlike
anything
i
ever
heard
where
the
harmony
the
chords
of
thirds
and
fifths
whatever
going
on
i
think
opium
is
going
to
help
me
understand
it
hawksworth
turned
still
puzzling
back
to
mukarrab
khan
and
waved
away
the
brown
ball
which
the
governor
immediately
washed
down
himself
with
fruit
nectar
is
our
music
a
bit
difficult
for
you
to
grasp
ambassador
mukarrab
khan
leaned
back
on
his
bolster
with
an
easy
smile
pity
for
truly
little
else
in
this
backwater
port
worth
the
bother
the
cuisine
is
abominable
the
classical
dancers
despicable
in
desperation
even
had
to
train
my
own
musicians
although
i
did
manage
to
steal
one
ustad
a
grand
master
away
from
agra
he
impulsively
reached
for
the
water
pipe
and
absorbed
a
deep
draw
his
eyes
misting
i
confess
i
do
find
it
hard
to
follow
hawksworth
took
a
draft
of
wine
from
the
fresh
cup
that
had
been
placed
beside
him
on
the
carpet
it
demands
a
connoisseur
taste
ambassador
not
unlike
an
appreciation
of
fine
wine
the
room
grew
ominously
still
for
a
moment
and
then
the
drums
suddenly
exploded
in
a
torrent
of
rhythm
wild
and
exciting
yet
unmistakably
disciplined
by
some
rigorous
underlying
structure
the
rhythm
soared
in
a
cycle
returning
again
and
again
after
each
elaborate
interlocking
of
time
and
its
divisions
back
to
a
forceful
crescendo
hawksworth
watched
mukarrab
khan
in
fascination
as
he
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes
in
wistful
anticipation
and
at
that
moment
the
instrumentalist
began
a
ascent
of
the
scale
quavering
each
note
in
erotic
suggestiveness
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
it
was
fingered
the
governor
seemed
absorbed
in
some
intuitive
communication
with
the
sound
a
reaction
to
music
hawksworth
had
never
before
witnessed
his
entire
body
would
perceptibly
tense
as
the
drummer
began
a
cycle
then
it
would
pulse
and
relax
the
instant
the
cycle
thudded
to
a
resolution
hawksworth
was
struck
by
the
sensuality
inherent
in
the
music
the
almost
sexual
sense
of
tension
and
release
then
he
noticed
two
eunuchs
leading
a
young
boy
into
the
room
the
youth
appeared
to
be
hovering
at
the
age
of
puberty
with
still
no
trace
of
a
beard
he
wore
a
small
but
elaborately
tied
pastel
turban
pearl
earrings
and
a
large
sapphire
on
a
chain
around
his
pale
throat
his
elaborate
ensemble
included
a
transparent
blouse
through
which
his
delicate
skin
glistened
in
the
lamplight
a
long
quilted
sash
at
his
waist
and
trousers
beneath
light
gauze
pajamas
that
clung
to
his
thighs
as
he
moved
his
lips
were
lightly
red
and
his
perfume
a
mixture
of
flowers
and
musk
the
boy
reached
for
a
ball
of
spiced
opium
and
settled
back
against
a
quilted
gold
bolster
next
to
mukarrab
khan
the
governor
studied
him
momentarily
and
then
returned
to
the
music
and
his
thoughts
he
reflected
again
on
abul
hasan
blundering
accident
on
the
field
and
what
it
must
signify
if
it
were
true
the
had
been
bought
by
the
shahbandar
as
some
whispered
then
it
meant
mirza
nuruddin
must
be
alarmed
to
the
point
of
imprudence
fearful
of
what
could
happen
if
the
english
were
detained
long
enough
for
the
portuguese
warships
to
prepare
which
meant
that
somewhere
behind
it
all
lay
the
hand
of
prince
jadar
he
examined
hawksworth
again
wondering
how
this
english
captain
could
have
savaged
the
viceroy
fleet
with
such
embarrassing
ease
what
he
asked
himself
again
will
the
queen
order
done
i
sorry
you
do
find
our
music
more
congenial
ambassador
perhaps
i
too
would
be
wiser
if
i
loved
it
less
the
passion
for
classical
music
has
cost
many
a
great
warrior
his
kingdom
in
india
over
the
last
centuries
for
example
when
the
great
moghul
patriarch
akman
conquered
baz
bahadur
once
the
proud
ruler
of
malwa
it
was
because
that
prince
was
a
better
patron
of
music
than
of
the
arts
of
war
he
smiled
reflectively
admittedly
the
great
akman
himself
also
flooded
his
court
with
musicians
but
then
he
had
the
wit
to
study
arms
as
well
regrettably
i
find
myself
lacking
his
strength
of
character
he
paused
to
take
a
sip
of
nectar
then
shrugged
but
enough
tell
me
now
what
you
really
think
of
my
ustad
my
master
sitarist
there
are
those
in
agra
who
will
never
forgive
me
for
stealing
him
away
i
not
sure
what
i
think
i
never
heard
a
composition
quite
like
the
one
he
playing
what
do
you
mean
by
mukarrab
khan
tone
was
puzzled
that
how
a
piece
of
music
is
written
out
mukarrab
khan
paused
and
examined
him
skeptically
for
a
long
moment
written
out
you
write
down
your
music
but
whatever
for
does
that
mean
your
musicians
play
the
same
song
again
and
again
precisely
the
same
way
if
they
good
they
do
a
composer
writes
a
piece
of
music
and
musicians
try
to
play
it
how
utterly
tiresome
mukarrab
khan
sighed
and
leaned
back
on
his
bolster
music
is
a
living
art
ambassador
it
meant
to
illuminate
the
emotions
of
the
one
who
gives
it
life
how
can
written
music
have
any
feeling
my
ustad
would
never
play
a
raga
the
same
way
twice
indeed
i
doubt
he
would
be
physically
capable
of
such
a
boorish
feat
you
mean
he
creates
a
new
composition
each
time
he
plays
not
precisely
but
his
handling
of
the
specific
notes
of
a
raga
must
speak
to
his
mood
mv
mood
these
vary
why
not
his
art
but
what
is
a
raga
then
if
not
a
song
that
always
difficult
to
explain
at
some
rudimentary
level
you
might
say
it
simply
a
melody
form
a
fixed
series
of
notes
around
which
a
musician
improvises
but
although
a
raga
has
a
rigorously
prescribed
ascending
and
descending
note
sequence
and
specific
melodic
motifs
it
also
has
its
own
mood
what
we
call
its
how
could
one
possibly
write
down
a
mood
i
guess
i
see
your
point
but
it
still
confusing
hawksworth
took
another
sip
of
wine
how
many
ragas
are
there
there
are
primary
scales
on
which
ragas
are
based
but
some
scales
have
more
than
one
raga
there
are
ragas
for
morning
for
evening
for
late
at
night
my
ustad
is
playing
a
late
evening
raga
now
although
he
uses
only
the
notes
and
motifs
peculiar
to
this
raga
what
he
does
with
them
is
entirely
governed
by
his
feeling
tonight
but
why
is
there
no
harmony
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
by
striking
several
notes
together
so
they
blend
to
produce
a
chord
mukarrab
khan
studied
him
uncomprehending
and
hawksworth
continued
if
i
had
my
lute
i
show
you
how
harmony
and
chords
are
used
in
an
english
song
hawksworth
thought
again
of
his
instrument
and
of
the
difficulty
he
had
protecting
it
during
the
voyage
he
knew
all
along
it
was
foolish
to
bring
it
but
he
often
told
himself
every
man
had
the
right
to
one
folly
then
by
all
means
the
governor
curiosity
seemed
to
arouse
him
instantly
from
the
opium
would
you
believe
i
never
met
a
who
could
play
an
instrument
any
instrument
but
my
lute
was
detained
along
with
all
my
belongings
at
the
customs
house
i
was
going
to
retrieve
my
chest
from
the
shahbandar
when
you
intercepted
his
men
ambassador
please
believe
i
had
good
reason
but
i
thought
i
told
you
arrangements
have
been
made
he
turned
and
dictated
rapidly
to
one
of
the
eunuchs
there
was
an
expressionless
bow
and
the
man
left
the
room
moments
later
he
returned
through
the
bronze
entry
doors
followed
by
two
servants
carrying
hawksworth
chest
one
at
each
end
i
ordered
your
belongings
sent
from
the
customs
house
this
afternoon
you
would
honor
me
by
staying
here
as
my
guest
mukarrab
khan
smiled
warmly
and
now
i
would
hear
you
play
this
english
instrument
hawksworth
was
momentarily
startled
wondering
why
his
safety
was
suddenly
of
such
great
interest
to
mukarrab
khan
but
he
pushed
aside
the
question
and
turned
to
examine
the
large
brass
lock
on
his
chest
although
it
had
been
newly
polished
to
a
high
sheen
as
had
the
entire
chest
there
was
no
visible
evidence
it
had
been
opened
he
extracted
the
key
from
his
doublet
slipped
it
into
the
lock
and
turned
it
twice
it
revolved
smoothly
opening
with
a
soft
click
the
lute
rested
precisely
where
he
had
left
it
its
body
was
shaped
like
a
huge
pear
cut
in
half
lengthwise
with
the
back
a
glistening
melon
of
curved
cedar
staves
and
the
face
a
polished
cherry
the
neck
was
broad
and
the
head
where
the
strings
were
wound
to
their
pegs
angled
sharply
back
he
admired
it
for
a
moment
already
eager
for
the
touch
of
its
dark
frets
during
the
voyage
it
had
been
wrapped
in
heavy
cloth
sealed
in
oilskins
and
stored
deep
in
his
cabin
chest
not
till
landfall
at
zanzibar
had
he
dared
expose
it
to
the
sea
air
of
all
english
music
he
still
loved
the
galliards
of
dowland
best
he
was
only
a
boy
when
dowland
first
book
of
galliards
was
published
but
he
had
been
made
to
learn
them
all
by
heart
because
his
exacting
tutor
had
despised
popular
ballads
and
street
songs
mukarrab
khan
called
for
the
instrument
and
slowly
turned
it
in
the
lamplight
its
polished
cedar
shining
like
a
great
jewel
he
then
passed
it
to
his
two
musicians
and
a
brief
discussion
in
persian
ensued
as
brows
were
wrinkled
and
grave
points
adjudicated
after
its
appearance
was
agreed
upon
the
instrumentalist
gingerly
plucked
a
gut
string
with
the
wire
plectrum
attached
to
his
forefinger
and
studied
its
sound
with
a
distant
expression
the
torrent
of
persian
began
anew
as
each
string
was
plucked
in
turn
and
its
particular
quality
debated
then
the
governor
revolved
to
hawksworth
i
congratulate
your
wisdom
ambassador
in
not
hazarding
a
truly
fine
instrument
on
a
sea
voyage
it
would
have
been
a
waste
of
real
workmanship
hawksworth
stared
at
him
dumbfounded
there
not
a
finer
lute
in
london
he
seized
it
back
i
had
it
specially
crafted
several
years
ago
by
a
master
a
man
once
to
the
queen
it
one
of
the
last
he
made
you
must
pardon
me
then
but
why
no
embellishment
no
ivory
inlay
no
carved
decoration
compare
if
you
will
ustad
qasim
sitar
it
a
work
of
fine
art
a
full
year
was
spent
on
its
decoration
note
the
head
has
been
carved
as
the
body
of
a
swan
the
neck
and
pegs
inlaid
with
finest
ivory
the
face
decorated
with
and
your
lute
has
absolutely
no
decoration
whatsoever
the
beauty
of
an
instrument
is
in
its
tone
yes
that
a
separate
point
but
perhaps
we
should
hear
it
played
by
one
skilled
in
its
use
i
must
confess
we
are
all
curious
what
can
be
done
with
so
simple
an
instrument
mukarrab
khan
shifted
on
his
bolster
while
the
young
man
next
to
him
toyed
with
a
jewel
not
troubling
to
disguise
his
boredom
hawksworth
tuned
the
strings
quickly
and
meticulously
then
he
settled
himself
on
the
carpet
and
took
a
deep
breath
his
fingers
were
stiff
his
mind
groggy
with
wine
but
he
would
play
a
song
he
knew
well
a
galliard
dowland
had
written
when
queen
elizabeth
was
still
alive
in
honor
of
a
cornwall
sea
captain
named
piper
whom
she
given
a
letter
of
marque
to
attack
the
spanish
but
who
instead
turned
an
uncontrollable
pirate
pillaging
the
shipping
of
any
flag
convenient
he
become
an
official
outlaw
but
a
genuine
english
folk
hero
and
dowland
had
honored
his
memory
with
a
rousing
composition
galliard
a
full
chord
followed
by
a
run
of
crisp
notes
cut
the
close
air
the
theme
was
somber
a
plaintive
query
in
a
minor
mode
followed
by
a
melodic
but
defiant
reply
just
the
answer
piper
would
have
given
to
the
charges
hawksworth
thought
the
servants
had
all
gathered
to
listen
and
the
eunuchs
had
stopped
gossiping
then
hawksworth
glanced
toward
the
musicians
who
had
shifted
themselves
onto
the
carpet
to
watch
both
the
sitarist
and
his
drummer
still
eyed
the
instrument
skeptically
no
hint
of
appreciation
in
their
look
hawksworth
had
expected
it
wait
till
they
hear
this
he
crouched
over
the
lute
and
attacked
the
strings
with
all
four
fingers
producing
a
dense
toccata
with
three
melodic
lines
advancing
at
once
two
in
the
treble
and
one
in
the
base
his
hand
flew
over
the
frets
until
it
seemed
every
fingertip
commanded
a
string
each
embellishing
a
theme
another
had
begun
then
he
brought
the
galliard
to
a
rousing
crescendo
with
a
flourish
that
spanned
two
entire
octaves
a
polite
silence
seemed
to
grip
the
room
mukarrab
khan
sipped
thoughtfully
from
his
cup
for
a
moment
his
jeweled
rings
refracting
the
lamplight
then
summoned
a
eunuch
and
whispered
briefly
in
his
ear
as
the
eunuch
passed
the
order
to
a
hovering
servant
mukarrab
khan
turned
to
hawksworth
your
english
music
is
interesting
ambassador
if
somewhat
simple
he
cleared
his
throat
as
an
excuse
to
pause
but
frankly
i
must
tell
you
it
touched
only
my
mind
not
my
heart
although
i
heard
it
i
did
not
feel
it
do
you
understand
the
difference
i
sensed
nothing
of
its
rasa
the
emotion
and
desire
one
should
taste
at
a
moment
like
this
the
merging
of
sound
and
spirit
your
english
music
seems
to
stand
aloof
unapproachable
mukarrab
khan
searched
for
words
it
inhabits
its
own
world
admirably
but
it
did
not
enter
mine
servants
suddenly
appeared
bearing
two
silver
trays
on
which
were
crystal
cups
of
green
frothy
liquid
as
the
servant
placed
hawksworth
tray
on
the
patterned
carpet
he
bowed
beaming
mukarrab
khan
ignored
his
own
tray
and
instead
summoned
the
sitarist
bahram
qasim
to
whisper
brief
instructions
in
his
ear
then
the
governor
turned
to
hawksworth
perhaps
i
can
show
you
what
i
mean
this
may
be
difficult
for
you
so
first
i
would
urge
you
try
a
cup
of
it
has
the
remarkable
effect
of
opening
one
heart
hawksworth
tested
the
beverage
warily
its
underlying
bitterness
had
been
obscured
with
sweet
yogurt
and
potent
spices
it
was
actually
very
palatable
he
drank
again
this
time
thirstily
what
did
you
call
this
yes
it
made
from
the
leaves
of
hemp
unlike
wine
which
only
dulls
the
spirit
the
senses
now
i
arranged
a
demonstration
for
you
he
signaled
the
sitarist
and
bahram
qasim
began
the
unmistakable
theme
of
piper
galliard
the
song
was
drawn
out
slowly
languorously
as
each
individual
note
was
introduced
lovingly
explored
for
its
own
pure
sound
and
then
framed
with
microtone
embellishment
and
a
sensual
vibrato
the
clear
simple
notes
of
the
lute
were
transmuted
into
an
almost
orchestral
richness
by
an
undertone
of
harmonic
density
from
the
sitar
sympathetic
strings
the
second
row
of
wires
beneath
those
being
plucked
tuned
to
match
the
notes
of
the
song
and
respond
without
being
touched
dowland
harmonies
were
absent
but
now
the
entire
room
resonated
with
a
single
majestic
chord
underlying
each
note
gradually
the
sitarist
accelerated
the
tempo
while
also
beginning
to
insert
his
own
melodic
variations
over
the
original
notes
of
the
theme
hawksworth
took
another
sip
of
suddenly
noticed
the
notes
seemed
to
be
weaving
a
tapestry
in
his
mind
evolving
an
elaborate
pattern
that
enveloped
the
room
with
shapes
as
colored
as
the
geometries
of
the
persian
carpet
next
the
drummer
casually
introduced
a
rhythmic
underpinning
his
lithe
fingers
touring
easily
over
and
around
the
taut
drumheads
as
he
dissected
then
restructured
the
simple
meter
of
dowland
music
he
seemed
to
regard
the
original
meter
as
merely
a
frame
a
skeleton
on
which
the
real
artistry
had
yet
to
be
applied
he
knowingly
subdivided
dowland
meter
into
minuscule
elements
of
time
and
with
these
devised
elaborate
new
interlockings
of
sound
and
silence
yet
each
new
structure
always
to
its
perfect
culmination
at
the
close
of
a
musical
phrase
then
as
he
punctuated
his
transient
edifice
with
a
thud
of
the
larger
drum
much
as
an
artist
might
sign
a
painting
with
an
elaborate
flourish
he
would
catch
hawksworth
incredulous
gaze
and
wink
his
eyes
twinkling
in
triumph
meanwhile
the
sitarist
structured
dowland
spirited
theme
to
the
drummer
frame
adding
microtones
dowland
had
never
imagined
and
matching
the
ornate
tempo
of
the
drum
as
they
blended
together
to
become
a
single
racing
heartbeat
hawksworth
realized
suddenly
that
he
was
no
longer
merely
hearing
the
music
that
instead
he
seemed
to
be
absorbing
it
how
curious
the
music
soared
on
to
a
final
crescendo
a
simultaneous
climax
of
sitar
and
drum
and
then
the
english
song
seemed
to
dissolve
slowly
into
the
incense
around
them
after
only
a
moment
pause
the
musicians
immediately
took
up
a
sensuous
late
evening
raga
hawksworth
looked
about
and
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
the
lamps
in
the
room
had
been
lowered
settling
a
darkness
about
the
musicians
and
the
moving
figures
around
him
he
felt
for
his
glass
of
and
saw
that
it
was
dry
and
that
another
had
been
placed
beside
it
he
drank
again
to
clear
his
mind
what
going
on
damned
if
i
stay
here
my
god
it
impossible
to
think
i
tired
no
not
tired
it
just
just
that
my
mind
is
like
i
swilled
a
cask
of
ale
but
i
still
in
perfect
control
and
where
mukarrab
khan
now
there
are
screens
where
he
was
sitting
covered
with
peacocks
that
strut
obscenely
from
one
screen
to
the
other
and
the
eunuchs
are
all
watching
bastards
i
take
back
my
sword
jesus
where
is
it
i
never
felt
so
adrift
but
i
not
staying
i
take
the
chest
and
damn
his
eunuchs
and
his
guards
he
ca
hold
me
here
not
even
on
charges
there
are
no
charges
leaving
i
find
the
men
he
pulled
himself
defiantly
to
his
feet
and
collapsed
chapter
eight
the
dream
was
more
vivid
than
reality
intensely
colored
and
astir
with
vague
forms
that
drifted
through
his
mind
ken
appearing
then
fading
the
room
seemed
airless
a
cell
of
gilded
blue
panels
and
gold
brocade
guarded
faces
hovered
around
and
above
their
eyes
intense
yet
unseeing
distant
as
masks
of
cathedral
sinner
and
saint
a
fingertip
brushed
his
cheek
and
with
its
touch
the
room
gloried
in
a
powerful
fragrance
of
saffron
then
a
hand
floating
unattached
gently
removed
his
doublet
another
slid
away
his
breeches
he
was
naked
he
looked
down
as
though
from
afar
at
the
texture
of
chest
and
thigh
and
he
wondered
dimly
if
they
were
his
own
then
other
hands
and
suddenly
he
was
immersed
in
a
sea
whose
shores
were
white
marble
whose
surface
sheened
with
oil
of
the
rose
translucent
petals
drifted
randomly
atop
the
crests
hands
toured
his
frame
discovering
every
tightened
nerve
while
powdered
sandalwood
enveloped
his
hair
and
beard
until
he
seemed
lost
in
a
fragrant
forest
as
suddenly
as
the
sea
had
come
it
drew
away
but
now
there
were
steaming
wraps
tingling
with
astringent
orange
and
clove
and
he
drifted
through
a
land
of
aloe
balm
and
amber
the
room
dissolved
into
until
at
last
only
a
single
face
remained
a
woman
with
eyes
round
and
moist
and
coldly
dark
her
lips
were
the
deep
red
of
betel
while
her
hair
was
coal
and
braided
in
a
skein
of
jeweled
tresses
a
faceted
stone
sparkled
on
her
left
nostril
and
heavy
gold
rings
swung
gently
from
each
ear
nipples
pressed
erect
against
her
diaphanous
blouse
and
between
her
breasts
clung
a
garland
of
pearls
the
heavy
bracelets
on
her
wrists
and
her
upper
arms
glistened
gold
in
the
flickering
candlelight
as
he
studied
her
eyes
they
seemed
locked
into
his
own
and
betrayed
no
notice
of
his
body
he
sent
his
voice
through
the
dream
carpeted
chambers
but
his
words
were
swallowed
in
dark
air
that
drew
out
their
sound
and
washed
it
to
thin
silence
in
a
final
awkward
futility
he
struggled
to
free
himself
from
the
velvet
bolster
but
gently
she
pressed
him
back
what
would
you
have
my
love
sweet
my
hand
a
cup
found
his
lips
and
before
he
knew
he
had
taken
more
of
the
incendiary
green
confection
its
warmth
grew
slowly
into
a
pale
light
that
shimmered
off
the
gilded
panels
and
then
coalesced
into
the
rainbow
now
pivoting
above
him
a
glistening
fan
of
peacock
feathers
swayed
by
a
faceless
woman
his
gaze
returned
to
the
eyes
and
again
he
searched
for
sound
then
came
a
voice
he
recognized
as
his
own
who
are
you
you
may
call
me
kali
others
do
it
a
name
you
would
not
understand
but
can
you
understand
that
love
is
surrender
the
words
coiled
about
his
head
coruscating
and
empty
of
meaning
he
shook
them
away
and
watched
as
she
brushed
a
strand
of
hair
from
his
face
with
that
simple
motion
her
nipples
traced
twin
heliotrope
arcs
across
the
gossamer
screen
of
her
blouse
he
examined
her
in
disbelief
unable
to
find
words
when
my
lover
lies
silent
i
do
as
i
choose
deftly
she
uncoiled
the
white
silk
sash
from
around
her
waist
and
in
a
single
practiced
motion
bound
it
over
his
eyes
the
room
vanished
in
the
dream
sudden
night
he
grew
intensely
aware
of
touch
and
smell
commands
came
in
an
alien
tongue
and
he
felt
his
breast
and
thighs
brushed
lightly
by
a
new
pungent
fragrance
we
have
cloaked
you
in
petals
of
spikenard
to
banish
the
sight
of
your
unshaven
body
a
so
little
of
what
pleases
a
woman
he
felt
a
light
brush
across
his
parted
lips
and
then
her
eyelashes
stiffened
dark
with
antimony
trilled
a
path
downward
over
his
skin
to
his
nipples
the
hardened
lashes
stroked
each
nipple
in
turn
with
rapid
flutters
until
the
skin
tightened
almost
to
bursting
an
excruciating
sensitivity
burned
through
him
but
still
the
lashes
fluttered
determinedly
almost
unendurably
until
his
aroused
tips
touched
the
aching
portals
of
pain
then
he
sensed
a
tongue
circle
each
nipple
in
turn
searching
out
the
one
most
ripe
he
felt
her
kneel
above
him
surrounding
him
with
open
thighs
that
clasped
his
chest
the
room
fell
expectantly
silent
then
as
an
unknown
syllable
sounded
somewhere
above
him
he
felt
the
nipple
of
his
right
breast
seized
in
the
lock
of
a
warm
moist
grasp
the
surrounding
thighs
rocked
gently
at
first
but
slowly
increased
their
rhythm
in
time
with
the
sound
of
breath
suddenly
he
felt
her
body
twist
lightly
and
another
tip
hardened
as
that
on
his
chest
began
to
trace
the
nipple
swollen
point
her
thighs
were
smooth
and
moist
as
she
pressed
in
with
spiraling
ever
more
rapid
intensity
he
found
himself
deeply
conscious
of
her
rhythms
and
the
hard
cadence
of
breath
he
reached
for
the
strength
to
rip
the
silk
from
his
eyes
to
end
the
tantalizing
dark
but
strength
was
not
there
or
time
before
he
could
stir
he
sensed
the
hardened
tip
shudder
again
a
grasp
took
his
nipple
and
worked
it
with
measured
spasms
until
the
austere
silence
was
cut
by
her
sharp
intake
of
breath
timed
to
match
a
single
insistent
contraction
that
seemed
to
envelope
the
whole
of
his
breast
he
felt
her
seize
his
hands
in
her
own
and
although
he
could
see
nothing
in
his
mind
there
grew
a
vision
of
her
eyes
at
that
moment
then
there
came
a
sound
partially
stifled
in
her
throat
but
not
before
it
had
found
the
gilded
walls
and
returned
annealed
to
a
glassy
relic
of
release
he
felt
her
slowly
withdraw
but
then
her
mouth
took
his
breast
till
it
had
drawn
away
the
musk
at
last
perhaps
to
signify
repletion
she
lightly
brushed
his
lips
with
the
tip
of
her
tongue
you
have
pleased
me
her
voice
was
quiet
now
almost
a
whisper
now
we
will
please
each
other
a
hand
worked
at
his
loins
methodically
applying
a
viscous
harshly
scented
oil
would
you
could
see
with
my
eyes
the
the
fabled
shiva
was
never
garlanded
such
as
this
or
anointed
so
lovingly
then
her
voice
turned
harsh
as
she
spoke
short
staccato
commands
in
an
unknown
tongue
bangles
sounded
and
silk
rustled
as
the
room
emptied
now
he
caught
a
new
scent
the
harsh
smell
he
remembered
from
the
box
the
governor
had
offered
i
will
tell
you
my
secret
she
whispered
close
to
his
ear
there
is
no
more
exciting
way
to
experience
the
ecstasy
of
love
than
with
the
essence
of
the
poppy
but
i
have
a
way
to
receive
it
no
one
else
knows
it
is
like
the
burst
of
a
lightning
stroke
its
power
envelopes
the
senses
he
felt
her
smooth
a
thick
paste
along
the
sides
of
his
phallus
and
sensed
a
tingle
as
she
clasped
it
carefully
with
both
hands
again
she
moved
above
him
but
curiously
there
was
no
touch
of
her
body
only
the
presence
of
her
scent
a
tight
ring
seemed
to
circle
his
flesh
and
he
felt
the
weight
of
her
rounded
buttocks
slide
down
onto
his
thighs
he
startled
upward
in
shock
and
disbelief
never
will
i
you
must
lie
still
my
love
in
your
surrender
only
i
may
have
my
will
she
began
at
once
to
move
above
his
thighs
and
again
muted
sounds
struggled
stillborn
in
her
throat
with
deliberate
regularity
her
rhythm
mounted
while
an
overwhelming
sensation
spread
upward
through
his
body
slowly
he
felt
his
new
slipping
from
him
the
convulsions
started
in
his
lower
thighs
as
muscles
tightened
involuntarily
and
then
the
precipice
grew
near
and
he
was
at
its
edge
and
he
was
falling
he
felt
the
surge
as
though
drawn
out
by
the
twist
of
her
buttocks
then
again
and
again
each
spasm
matched
by
her
own
as
she
worked
to
envelop
him
completely
he
was
scarcely
aware
of
her
nails
fixed
in
his
breasts
at
that
instant
he
seemed
to
drift
apart
from
his
body
and
observe
mutely
as
it
was
consumed
by
its
own
sensations
until
numbness
washed
over
him
stilling
his
sense
as
he
lay
in
exhaustion
his
mind
sorted
through
her
words
and
in
the
dream
darkness
he
vowed
to
take
her
again
the
next
time
it
you
who
surrender
woman
called
kali
to
my
will
and
you
find
out
the
meaning
of
surrender
but
his
thoughts
were
lost
among
the
gilded
panels
as
she
pulled
the
silk
from
his
eyes
and
quietly
whispered
something
he
did
not
understand
in
that
instant
he
thought
he
saw
where
a
tear
had
stained
a
path
across
one
cheek
she
looked
at
him
longingly
then
touched
his
lips
with
her
own
for
a
long
moment
before
slipping
quietly
into
the
dark
the
dream
dissolved
in
sleep
and
she
was
gone
hawksworth
was
suddenly
awake
the
chill
of
early
dawn
penetrated
his
face
and
hands
and
his
hair
sparkled
with
light
jewels
of
dew
his
leather
couch
was
moist
and
glistening
while
the
pale
sky
above
was
blocked
by
a
tapestried
canopy
only
in
the
east
above
the
white
railing
of
the
rooftop
could
he
see
the
glitter
of
a
waning
venus
her
brief
reign
soon
to
dissolve
in
the
red
wash
of
early
sun
he
looked
about
his
white
brick
enclosure
and
saw
only
a
light
wooden
door
leading
into
a
apartment
he
had
no
sooner
drawn
himself
up
to
inhale
the
scented
dawn
than
two
smiling
men
were
standing
over
him
bowing
both
wore
turbans
jackets
and
a
white
wrap
about
their
lower
torso
squinting
into
their
eyes
hawksworth
remembered
them
from
the
evening
before
they
had
brought
the
basin
of
water
in
which
he
had
first
washed
as
he
pulled
the
embroidered
coverlet
closer
about
him
he
noticed
a
strange
numbness
in
his
body
and
his
mind
ached
as
he
tried
to
remember
what
precisely
had
happened
there
was
a
game
on
horseback
with
the
governor
and
then
a
banquet
with
an
argument
in
which
mukarrab
khan
threatened
to
betray
us
to
the
portugals
a
curious
evening
of
music
and
then
dreams
pulling
himself
up
off
the
couch
he
started
unsteadily
across
the
hard
flat
tile
of
the
roof
immediately
a
servant
was
beside
him
producing
a
heavy
silk
wrap
and
swathing
it
around
his
shoulders
and
waist
then
the
man
bowed
again
and
spoke
in
accented
turki
may
allah
prosper
you
today
sahib
may
your
fortunes
answer
the
prayers
of
the
poor
the
man
expression
softened
to
match
his
own
compliment
should
it
please
the
sahib
his
morning
bath
is
waiting
without
thinking
without
even
hearing
the
words
he
allowed
himself
to
be
led
through
the
doorway
into
the
apartment
there
in
the
center
of
the
room
was
his
chest
its
lock
intact
he
examined
it
with
a
quick
glance
then
followed
the
servants
down
a
set
of
stone
stairs
to
the
veranda
where
a
steaming
marble
tub
waited
good
jesus
not
again
how
can
i
make
them
understand
bathing
weakens
a
man
he
started
to
turn
but
suddenly
two
eunuchs
appeared
out
of
nowhere
and
were
guiding
him
up
the
two
marble
steps
to
a
stone
platform
where
they
seated
him
on
a
filigreed
wooden
stool
silently
the
servants
stripped
away
his
light
wrap
and
began
to
knead
his
body
and
his
hair
with
a
fragrant
powder
a
blend
of
wood
bark
and
some
astringent
fruit
the
scent
was
mild
pleasant
and
as
their
hands
traveled
over
him
he
felt
the
pores
of
his
skin
open
to
divulge
their
residual
rankness
this
is
better
he
thought
cleaning
without
water
with
only
some
sort
of
powder
i
feel
refreshed
already
his
muscles
loosened
as
the
men
vigorously
worked
the
mixture
into
his
skin
and
then
carefully
cleansed
it
away
with
bulky
cotton
towels
next
they
turned
to
his
hair
combing
and
massaging
more
of
the
powder
through
it
strand
by
strand
at
last
they
signaled
for
him
to
rise
and
enter
the
tub
its
surface
glistened
with
a
perfumed
oil
and
the
rising
steam
smelled
faintly
of
clove
before
he
could
protest
the
eunuchs
guided
him
down
the
marble
steps
as
he
settled
into
the
steam
again
he
was
surrounded
by
waiting
servants
who
sprinkled
more
oil
over
the
water
and
massaged
the
emulsion
into
his
hair
and
skin
i
being
bathed
in
oil
he
smiled
marveling
it
absurd
yet
here
it
seems
perfectly
right
the
men
worked
devotedly
as
though
he
were
an
inanimate
utensil
whose
purity
was
their
lifelong
obligation
his
body
now
glistened
with
a
reddish
tint
of
the
oil
matching
the
early
glow
of
the
sun
that
penetrated
the
shuttered
windows
as
they
motioned
for
him
to
leave
the
bath
he
discovered
to
his
amazement
that
he
would
have
been
perfectly
content
to
stay
forever
but
again
hands
were
there
guiding
him
this
time
toward
a
low
wooden
bench
covered
with
thick
woven
tapestries
what
now
what
else
can
they
do
i
cleaner
than
the
day
i
was
born
what
more
he
was
prostrate
on
the
couch
a
rough
haircloth
worked
against
his
legs
and
torso
sending
the
blood
surging
at
the
same
time
a
piece
of
porous
sandstone
in
the
practiced
hands
of
another
servant
stripped
away
the
loosened
calluses
and
scales
from
his
feet
a
third
man
massaged
still
more
perfumed
oil
hinting
of
aloe
and
orange
into
his
back
and
along
his
sides
and
shoulders
his
body
had
become
an
invigorated
pliant
reed
they
motioned
for
him
to
sit
up
and
as
he
watched
one
of
the
men
produced
a
mirror
and
razor
next
he
opened
a
bottle
of
fragrant
liquid
and
began
to
apply
it
to
hawksworth
beard
and
chest
and
then
also
to
his
legs
and
crotch
what
the
purpose
of
that
razor
we
have
orders
to
shave
you
sahib
in
our
manner
the
turbaned
man
who
had
greeted
him
that
morning
bowed
slightly
as
he
signaled
the
barber
to
begin
you
are
to
be
shaved
completely
as
is
our
custom
trim
my
beard
if
you
like
but
no
more
damn
you
if
you
shave
me
like
some
catamite
hawksworth
started
to
rise
from
his
stool
but
the
barber
was
already
over
him
the
blade
flying
across
his
face
with
a
menacing
deftness
it
has
been
ordered
sahib
the
turbaned
man
bowed
again
and
without
pausing
for
a
reply
produced
a
short
curved
metal
device
and
began
to
probe
hawksworth
ears
his
face
intent
in
concentration
as
he
carefully
extracted
an
enormous
ball
of
gray
mud
and
encrusted
sea
salt
he
scraped
the
other
ear
with
the
same
deft
twist
then
he
flipped
the
same
instrument
and
began
to
trim
hawksworth
ragged
fingernails
hawksworth
turned
to
the
mirror
to
discover
that
his
beard
had
already
disappeared
leaving
him
at
least
i
be
in
fashion
back
home
he
thought
if
i
ever
get
back
beards
are
passing
from
style
but
what
he
doing
now
by
heaven
no
the
razor
swept
cleanly
across
hawksworth
chest
leaving
a
swath
of
soft
skin
in
its
wake
it
came
down
again
barely
missing
a
nipple
as
he
moved
to
rise
you
must
be
still
sahib
you
will
harm
yourself
i
told
you
i
not
have
it
hawksworth
pushed
the
razor
away
but
it
is
our
custom
the
man
seemed
to
plead
khan
sahib
ordered
that
you
be
groomed
as
an
honored
guest
well
damn
your
customs
enough
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
then
the
turbaned
man
bowed
his
face
despondent
as
the
sahib
desires
he
signaled
the
barber
to
rub
a
light
coat
of
oil
on
hawksworth
face
and
then
to
begin
trimming
hawksworth
hair
with
the
pair
of
silver
scissors
he
had
brought
the
barber
quickly
snipped
away
the
growth
of
the
voyage
leaving
the
hair
moderately
cropped
in
the
moghul
fashion
hawksworth
examined
the
mirror
again
damn
if
i
would
make
a
proper
cheapside
dandy
right
in
style
and
i
hate
being
in
style
then
the
turbaned
man
produced
a
heavy
lead
comb
and
began
to
work
it
repeatedly
through
hawksworth
hair
hawksworth
watched
the
mirror
in
confusion
what
he
doing
it
already
been
combed
and
it
so
short
there
no
point
anyway
then
he
noticed
the
slight
traces
of
gray
around
the
sides
beginning
to
darken
taking
on
the
color
of
the
lead
please
open
your
mouth
the
turbaned
man
stood
above
him
holding
a
dark
piece
of
wood
frayed
at
the
end
and
crooked
and
i
will
scrape
your
teeth
with
root
but
that
insane
teeth
are
cleaned
with
a
piece
of
cloth
and
a
toothpick
or
rubbed
with
a
bit
of
sugar
and
salt
ash
the
man
was
scrubbing
away
at
hawksworth
mouth
tongue
gums
teeth
using
a
dentifrice
that
tasted
like
burnt
almond
shells
next
he
offered
a
mouth
rinse
to
remove
the
debris
the
turbaned
man
then
inspected
hawksworth
critically
from
several
sides
finally
venturing
to
speak
if
i
may
suggest
a
bit
of
castor
oil
darkened
with
lampblack
would
render
your
eyes
much
more
striking
without
waiting
for
confirmation
he
applied
a
few
quick
strokes
to
eyelids
much
as
an
artist
might
touch
up
a
canvas
then
one
of
the
eunuchs
stepped
forward
and
supplied
a
silver
tray
to
the
turbaned
servants
on
it
were
folded
garments
a
pair
of
blue
trousers
a
patterned
shirt
and
a
coat
of
thin
muslin
they
dressed
hawksworth
quickly
and
then
secured
a
patterned
sash
about
his
waist
waiting
on
the
floor
were
leather
slippers
with
a
curved
toe
and
a
back
what
have
you
done
with
my
doublet
and
breeches
and
my
boots
they
are
being
cleaned
today
sahib
you
may
have
them
again
when
you
wish
but
you
may
prefer
to
wear
our
garments
while
our
guest
the
turbaned
man
bowed
again
then
he
moved
away
and
held
a
long
mirror
for
hawksworth
to
examine
himself
have
we
pleased
you
sahib
hawksworth
scarcely
recognized
himself
he
had
been
transformed
from
a
rank
but
honest
seaman
into
a
moghul
noble
youthful
smelling
of
spice
the
soreness
was
banished
from
his
limbs
and
even
his
wound
had
all
but
disappeared
his
hair
was
clean
and
completely
dark
and
his
skin
glowed
and
his
new
clothes
were
more
elaborate
than
anything
he
had
ever
worn
now
if
you
will
please
follow
us
to
the
garden
khan
sahib
has
suggested
you
begin
your
day
with
some
hawksworth
followed
the
men
through
the
shuttered
doorway
into
the
open
courtyard
the
morning
sun
now
illuminated
the
tops
of
a
large
grove
of
palm
trees
that
circled
an
open
cistern
he
quickly
surveyed
the
buildings
hoping
to
gain
his
bearings
so
i
been
quartered
in
one
of
the
side
buildings
off
the
main
palace
but
there
are
many
many
rooms
who
living
here
a
group
of
servants
stood
waiting
at
the
base
of
one
of
the
palms
when
they
saw
hawksworth
they
mobilized
to
action
one
young
man
among
them
wearing
a
white
wrap
around
his
lower
torso
immediately
secured
his
belt
and
began
to
shimmy
up
the
leaning
palm
when
he
reached
the
top
he
locked
his
legs
around
the
trunk
and
carefully
detached
an
earthen
pot
that
hung
beneath
an
incision
in
the
bark
of
the
tree
balancing
the
pot
in
one
hand
he
stretched
and
nimbly
pulled
off
a
number
of
leaves
from
the
tree
and
then
lowered
himself
carrying
his
load
the
moment
his
feet
touched
ground
he
raced
toward
the
veranda
and
delivered
the
pot
and
leaves
to
a
waiting
eunuch
hawksworth
watched
as
the
eunuchs
first
inspected
the
items
and
then
ordered
them
prepared
the
leaves
were
washed
thoroughly
with
water
from
the
cistern
and
then
folded
into
natural
cups
the
liquor
from
the
pot
was
strained
through
muslin
into
a
crystal
decanter
and
the
earthen
receptacle
discarded
then
one
of
the
turbaned
servants
poured
a
large
portion
of
the
liquor
from
the
decanter
into
a
cup
and
offered
it
to
hawksworth
it
sahib
one
of
the
pleasures
of
early
morning
in
india
his
manner
could
not
entirely
hide
his
pride
palm
wine
makes
itself
overnight
it
does
not
last
out
the
day
when
the
sun
shines
the
trees
only
give
off
vinegar
hawksworth
gingerly
sipped
the
newly
fermented
palm
sap
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
its
light
flavor
totally
unlike
ale
or
even
canary
wine
after
the
third
cup
the
world
around
began
to
acquire
a
light
sparkle
of
its
own
and
he
realized
the
sap
was
more
potent
than
it
seemed
not
a
bad
way
to
start
the
day
what
do
you
call
it
it
comes
from
the
and
some
it
toddy
toddy
it
called
it
more
than
passable
grog
thank
you
sahib
drink
too
much
and
you
will
spend
the
day
with
your
head
in
a
buzz
the
servant
giggled
so
now
perhaps
you
should
eat
he
consulted
briefly
with
the
eunuchs
who
nodded
and
signaled
toward
the
veranda
moments
later
a
tray
appeared
piled
high
with
covered
breads
and
glass
dishes
of
sweet
curds
some
hard
cheese
also
had
found
its
way
onto
the
tray
and
hawksworth
wondered
if
this
was
to
placate
his
european
taste
he
sipped
more
of
the
toddy
and
munched
the
bread
and
curds
then
he
saw
the
women
there
were
five
they
seemed
clustered
in
a
group
as
they
entered
the
courtyard
but
then
he
realized
it
was
an
aristocratic
lady
surrounded
by
four
maids
they
did
not
know
he
was
there
for
none
covered
her
face
as
he
watched
them
they
seemed
preoccupied
in
an
increasingly
animated
exchange
then
the
aristocratic
woman
stepped
determinedly
ahead
turned
and
curtly
gave
instructions
whose
seriousness
was
clear
even
if
her
words
were
foreign
her
voice
was
not
strident
but
its
authority
was
unmistakable
the
other
women
paused
then
slowly
one
by
one
they
seemed
to
acknowledge
her
orders
and
they
bowed
the
lady
whirled
and
continued
on
her
way
while
the
other
four
women
turned
toward
the
direction
they
had
come
then
as
though
the
resolution
of
the
argument
had
suddenly
made
them
aware
of
their
surroundings
they
all
seemed
to
see
hawksworth
at
once
all
five
women
froze
hawksworth
smiled
and
tried
to
remember
the
bow
he
had
seen
performed
to
him
so
often
but
he
could
not
remove
his
eyes
from
the
first
woman
who
was
more
striking
than
any
he
had
ever
before
seen
her
skin
was
fair
with
a
warm
hint
of
olive
and
her
high
cheekbones
stood
in
stunning
relief
as
they
glanced
away
the
golden
light
of
dawn
her
nose
was
thin
and
sculptured
while
her
lips
would
have
been
full
had
they
not
been
drawn
tight
in
response
to
some
unspecified
inner
determination
yet
her
eyes
seemed
untouched
by
what
had
just
transpired
they
were
clear
and
receptive
even
warm
and
hawksworth
asked
himself
at
that
moment
if
this
bespoke
innocence
or
guile
in
dress
and
adornment
she
scarcely
differed
from
her
maids
all
had
long
black
hair
brushed
to
gleaming
and
protected
from
the
morning
air
with
a
transparent
gossamer
scarf
edged
in
gold
embroidery
at
first
glance
there
seemed
little
to
distinguish
among
the
tight
strands
of
pearls
each
wore
at
the
neck
or
the
jeweled
bands
on
their
wrists
and
upper
arms
each
wore
a
tight
silk
halter
for
a
blouse
and
to
hawksworth
assessing
eyes
the
maids
all
seemed
to
have
abundant
breasts
swelling
their
halters
to
overflowing
some
perhaps
all
with
breasts
more
generous
than
the
lady
herself
then
he
noted
in
amazement
that
the
women
actually
wore
a
form
of
tapered
silk
trouser
a
legged
pajama
similar
to
that
worn
by
aristocratic
men
unlike
the
male
style
however
each
woman
body
was
enveloped
by
a
long
transparent
skirt
suspended
from
a
band
that
circled
her
torso
just
beneath
her
breasts
and
whereas
men
all
wore
a
long
scarf
tied
about
the
waist
of
their
cloaks
and
hanging
down
the
front
the
women
all
had
a
long
pleated
panel
tucked
directly
into
the
front
waistband
of
their
trousers
and
reaching
almost
to
the
ground
he
could
not
help
noticing
that
it
clung
sensually
to
their
thighs
as
they
walked
while
its
hem
tinkled
against
the
gold
bracelets
each
woman
wore
at
her
ankles
their
shoes
were
red
turkish
leather
with
gold
decorations
sewn
across
the
top
and
a
pointed
toe
that
curved
upward
the
only
difference
between
the
lady
and
her
maids
seemed
to
be
in
the
rich
fabric
of
her
lightly
clinging
trousers
then
too
there
was
slightly
more
gold
thread
in
her
long
transparent
skirt
and
among
the
pearls
at
her
neck
nestled
an
unmistakable
blue
sapphire
as
large
as
a
walnut
but
her
primary
distinction
was
not
merely
the
classic
lines
of
her
face
or
the
perfect
curve
of
her
waist
and
thighs
but
rather
something
in
her
bearing
in
her
assured
but
unmannered
carriage
her
real
beauty
lay
in
her
breeding
all
five
women
stared
at
hawksworth
in
momentary
surprise
and
shock
then
each
maid
automatically
seized
her
transparent
scarf
and
pulled
it
across
her
lower
face
the
woman
also
moved
instinctively
to
do
the
same
but
then
she
seemed
to
consciously
stop
herself
and
with
an
obvious
attempt
at
restraint
she
walked
on
barefaced
past
the
courtyard
and
into
the
garden
beyond
alone
hawksworth
watched
her
form
disappear
among
the
clipped
hedges
and
elaborate
marble
pavilions
of
the
garden
he
noticed
a
curious
sensation
in
his
chest
as
she
passed
from
view
and
he
suddenly
found
himself
wanting
very
much
to
follow
her
when
he
finally
turned
and
looked
back
the
other
women
had
already
vanished
only
then
did
he
realize
that
all
the
servants
had
been
watching
him
the
one
nearest
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
and
smiled
knowingly
perhaps
it
will
not
surprise
you
sahib
to
learn
that
she
was
once
the
favorite
of
the
moghul
himself
and
now
she
is
in
surat
amazing
but
why
she
here
hawksworth
glanced
back
at
the
garden
once
more
to
assure
himself
she
was
indeed
lost
to
its
recesses
she
is
shirin
the
first
wife
of
khan
sahib
he
moved
closer
to
hawksworth
so
that
his
lowered
voice
would
not
reach
the
eunuchs
she
was
removed
from
the
moghul
married
to
khan
sahib
last
year
by
queen
janahara
just
before
her
majesty
had
him
appointed
the
governor
of
surat
some
believe
she
appointed
him
here
to
remove
shirin
from
agra
because
she
feared
her
the
servant
voice
became
a
whisper
we
all
know
she
has
refused
his
excellency
the
legal
rights
of
a
husband
the
silence
of
the
court
was
cut
by
the
unmistakable
voice
of
mukarrab
khan
sounding
in
anger
as
he
gave
some
command
from
within
the
palace
there
followed
a
chorus
of
women
wails
hawksworth
turned
to
the
servant
but
the
man
read
his
inquiring
glance
he
has
ordered
the
women
whipped
for
disobeying
his
order
to
accompany
shirin
at
all
times
even
when
she
walks
in
the
garden
then
the
door
opened
again
and
mukarrab
khan
strode
into
the
morning
sunshine
captain
hawksworth
i
trust
allah
gave
you
rest
i
slept
so
well
i
find
difficulty
remembering
all
we
said
last
night
hawksworth
watched
him
carefully
will
he
honor
his
threat
to
deliver
us
to
the
viceroy
for
a
trial
at
goa
it
was
an
amusing
evening
hardly
a
time
for
weighty
diplomatic
exchange
and
did
you
enjoy
my
little
present
hawksworth
pondered
his
question
for
a
moment
and
the
drugged
dream
of
the
night
before
suddenly
became
real
you
mean
the
woman
she
was
very
unusual
very
different
from
the
women
of
england
yes
i
daresay
she
was
one
of
my
final
gifts
from
agra
i
often
have
her
entertain
my
guests
if
you
like
you
may
keep
her
while
you
stay
with
me
i
already
hear
she
fancies
you
the
serving
women
call
her
kali
after
a
goddess
from
their
infidel
pantheon
i
think
that
one
their
deity
of
destruction
why
did
they
give
her
that
name
perhaps
she
tell
you
herself
sometime
mukarrab
khan
gestured
for
a
servant
to
bring
his
cloak
i
hope
you
forgive
me
but
i
regret
i
must
abandon
you
for
a
time
among
my
least
pleasant
duties
is
a
monthly
journey
to
cambay
our
northern
port
in
this
province
it
always
requires
almost
a
week
but
i
have
no
choice
their
shahbandar
would
rob
the
moghul
treasury
itself
if
he
were
not
watched
but
i
think
you
enjoy
yourself
in
my
absence
i
would
enjoy
it
more
if
i
could
be
with
my
men
and
forgo
the
endless
intrigues
my
kali
undoubtedly
plans
for
you
he
monitored
hawksworth
unsettled
expression
or
perhaps
it
a
boy
you
prefer
very
well
if
you
wish
you
may
even
have
i
more
interested
in
the
safety
of
our
merchants
and
seamen
and
our
cargo
i
have
seen
the
men
since
yesterday
at
the
customs
house
they
all
quite
well
i
lodged
them
with
a
port
official
who
speaks
portuguese
which
your
chief
merchant
also
seems
to
understand
i
told
by
the
way
he
a
thoroughly
unpleasant
specimen
when
can
i
see
them
why
any
time
you
choose
you
have
only
to
speak
to
one
of
the
eunuchs
but
why
trouble
yourself
today
spend
it
here
and
rest
perhaps
enjoy
the
grounds
and
the
garden
tomorrow
is
time
enough
to
the
wearisome
halls
of
commerce
hawksworth
decided
that
the
time
had
come
to
raise
the
critical
question
and
what
about
the
portugals
and
their
false
charges
i
think
that
tiresome
matter
can
be
with
time
i
sent
notice
to
the
court
in
agra
officially
that
you
wish
to
travel
there
when
the
reply
is
received
matters
can
be
settled
in
the
meantime
i
must
insist
you
stay
here
in
the
palace
it
a
matter
of
your
position
and
frankly
your
safety
the
portuguese
do
not
always
employ
upright
means
to
achieve
their
ends
he
tightened
his
traveling
cloak
do
worry
yourself
unduly
just
try
to
make
the
most
of
my
humble
hospitality
the
palace
grounds
are
at
your
disposal
perhaps
find
something
in
all
this
to
engage
your
curiosity
mukarrab
khan
brushed
away
a
fly
from
his
cloak
there
the
garden
and
if
bored
by
that
then
you
might
wish
to
examine
the
persian
observatory
constructed
by
my
predecessor
you
a
seaman
and
i
presume
a
navigator
perhaps
you
can
fathom
how
it
all
works
i
never
been
able
to
make
anything
out
of
it
ask
the
servants
to
show
you
or
just
have
some
wine
on
the
veranda
and
enjoy
the
view
he
bowed
with
official
decorum
and
was
gone
his
entourage
of
guards
in
tow
hawksworth
turned
to
see
the
servants
waiting
politely
the
turbaned
man
whose
high
forehead
and
noble
visage
were
even
more
striking
now
in
the
direct
sunshine
was
dictating
in
a
low
voice
to
the
others
discreetly
translating
mukarrab
khan
orders
into
hindi
the
language
that
seemed
common
to
all
the
servants
the
palace
and
its
grounds
are
at
your
disposal
sahib
the
servant
with
the
large
white
turban
stood
waiting
our
pleasure
is
to
serve
you
i
like
to
be
alone
for
a
while
to
think
about
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
garden
of
course
sahib
perhaps
i
could
have
the
honor
of
being
your
guide
i
think
i
prefer
to
see
it
alone
the
servant
dismay
was
transparent
but
he
merely
bowed
and
immediately
seemed
to
dissolve
into
the
marble
porticoes
of
the
veranda
as
did
all
the
others
hawksworth
watched
in
amazement
they
really
do
follow
orders
now
if
i
can
start
to
figure
out
this
place
i
do
need
guides
all
i
need
are
my
eyes
and
luck
the
garden
spread
out
before
him
unlike
the
closely
clipped
geometry
of
the
courtyard
he
had
seen
the
night
before
this
was
less
formal
and
more
natural
with
a
long
waterway
receding
into
the
horizon
the
pond
was
flanked
by
parallel
arbors
along
each
side
shading
wide
paved
walkways
he
noticed
there
were
no
flowers
the
main
focus
in
an
english
garden
only
gravel
walks
and
the
watercourse
the
sense
was
one
of
sublime
control
several
gardeners
in
loincloths
were
wading
in
the
shallow
reservoir
adjusting
the
flow
from
bubbling
fountains
that
spewed
from
its
surface
at
geometrically
regular
spacings
while
others
were
intently
pruning
in
what
seemed
a
superfluous
almost
compulsive
act
the
already
immaculate
hedges
as
hawksworth
walked
past
trying
to
absorb
a
sense
of
place
the
gardeners
appraised
him
mutely
with
quick
flicking
sweeps
of
their
eyes
but
none
made
any
move
to
acknowledge
his
presence
the
sun
burned
through
the
almost
limitless
sky
whose
blue
was
polished
to
a
ceramic
glaze
and
the
air
was
clean
and
perfumed
with
nectar
the
garden
lay
about
him
like
a
mosaic
of
naturalism
perfected
through
the
conspicuous
hand
of
man
nature
had
been
coerced
or
charmed
to
exquisite
refinement
the
gravel
pathway
ended
abruptly
as
he
reached
the
pond
far
shore
terminated
by
a
row
of
marble
flagstones
beyond
lay
geometrical
arbors
of
trees
mangoes
apples
pears
lemons
and
even
oranges
hawksworth
tightened
his
new
robe
about
his
waist
and
entered
one
of
the
orchard
many
pathways
marveling
i
found
the
garden
of
eden
the
rows
of
trees
spread
out
in
perfect
regularity
squared
as
carefully
as
the
columns
of
the
palace
verandas
and
organized
by
species
of
fruit
as
he
explored
the
forest
he
began
to
find
its
regularity
satisfying
and
curiously
calming
then
in
the
distance
over
the
treetops
a
high
stone
wall
came
into
view
and
from
beyond
could
be
heard
the
splashes
of
men
laboring
in
the
moat
he
realized
he
had
reached
the
farthest
extent
of
the
palace
grounds
as
he
neared
the
wall
the
orchard
gave
way
to
an
abandoned
clearing
in
whose
center
stood
a
marble
stairway
projecting
upward
into
space
leading
nowhere
the
original
polish
on
its
steps
was
now
buried
in
layers
of
dust
and
overgrowth
was
there
once
a
villa
here
but
where
the
then
he
saw
the
rest
curving
upward
on
either
side
of
the
stairway
was
a
band
of
marble
over
two
feet
wide
and
almost
twenty
feet
in
length
concave
etched
and
numbered
it
some
sort
of
sundial
but
it
enormous
he
turned
and
realized
he
was
standing
next
to
yet
another
stone
instrument
a
round
plaque
in
red
and
white
marble
like
the
dial
of
a
water
clock
on
which
persian
symbols
for
the
zodiac
had
been
inscribed
and
beyond
that
was
the
remains
of
a
circular
building
perforated
with
dozens
of
doorways
with
a
tall
pillar
in
the
middle
next
to
it
was
a
shallow
marble
well
half
a
hemisphere
sunk
into
the
ground
with
precise
gradations
etched
all
across
the
bottom
hawksworth
walked
in
among
the
marble
instruments
his
astonishment
growing
they
were
all
etched
to
a
precision
he
had
never
before
seen
in
stone
this
observatory
is
incredible
the
sundial
is
obvious
even
if
the
purpose
of
the
stairway
over
its
center
is
but
what
the
round
vertical
plaque
or
that
round
building
there
and
the
curious
marble
well
could
those
be
some
sort
of
persian
astrolabe
like
navigators
use
to
estimate
latitude
by
fixing
the
elevation
of
the
sun
or
stars
what
are
they
all
for
some
to
fix
stars
others
to
predict
eclipses
but
there
has
to
be
more
these
are
for
observation
which
means
there
have
to
be
charts
or
computations
or
something
it
said
the
persians
once
mastered
a
level
of
mathematics
and
astronomy
far
beyond
anything
known
in
europe
is
this
some
forgotten
outpost
of
that
time
just
waiting
to
be
rediscovered
he
turned
and
examined
the
instruments
again
finding
himself
wondering
for
an
instant
if
they
could
somehow
be
hoisted
aboard
the
and
returned
to
england
and
if
the
observatory
still
here
perhaps
the
charts
are
here
somewhere
too
his
excitement
mounted
as
he
searched
the
rest
of
the
clearing
then
he
saw
what
he
wanted
it
has
to
be
there
abutting
the
stone
wall
was
a
small
hut
of
stone
with
slatted
windows
and
a
weathered
wooden
door
that
was
wedged
ajar
its
base
permanently
encrusted
in
the
dried
mud
of
the
rainy
season
the
wall
behind
was
so
weathered
that
the
metal
spikes
along
its
top
had
actually
rusted
away
this
whole
place
must
have
been
deserted
for
years
what
a
waste
as
he
approached
the
weathered
stone
hut
he
tried
to
dampen
his
own
hopes
how
can
there
be
anything
left
who
knows
how
long
it
been
abandoned
and
even
if
there
are
calculations
or
maybe
even
books
they
most
likely
written
in
persian
or
arabic
he
took
hold
of
the
rotting
door
which
left
a
layer
of
decaying
wood
on
his
hand
and
wrenched
it
open
wider
kicking
a
path
for
its
base
through
the
crusted
mud
then
he
slipped
sideways
through
the
opening
a
stifled
startled
cry
cut
the
dense
air
of
the
hut
and
an
oil
lamp
glowing
in
the
black
was
smothered
in
a
single
movement
then
came
a
woman
voice
you
not
allowed
here
servants
are
forbidden
beyond
the
orchard
she
had
begun
in
persian
then
repeated
herself
in
hindi
who
are
you
hawksworth
startled
by
the
unknown
languages
began
in
english
and
then
switched
to
turkish
i
thought
the
english
the
voice
suddenly
found
control
and
its
turki
was
flawless
you
were
in
the
courtyard
this
morning
she
advanced
slowly
toward
the
shaft
of
light
from
the
doorway
what
are
you
doing
here
khan
sahib
could
have
you
killed
if
the
eunuchs
discover
you
he
watched
as
her
face
emerged
from
the
shadows
then
his
heart
skipped
it
was
shirin
the
govern
khan
sahib
told
me
about
this
observatory
he
said
i
stars
do
not
shine
in
the
day
nor
the
sun
in
this
room
what
are
you
doing
in
here
i
thought
there
might
be
charts
or
a
library
hawksworth
heard
his
own
voice
echo
against
the
raw
stone
walls
of
the
room
he
studied
her
face
in
the
half
light
realizing
with
a
shock
that
she
was
even
more
striking
now
than
in
the
sunshine
of
the
garden
did
he
also
tell
you
to
plunder
all
you
find
in
the
palace
grounds
he
said
i
might
find
the
observatory
curious
as
a
navigator
he
was
right
but
there
must
be
some
charts
i
thought
this
room
might
there
are
some
old
papers
here
perhaps
he
thought
this
place
would
keep
you
occupied
or
test
you
one
more
time
what
do
you
mean
she
answered
with
a
hard
laugh
then
circled
hawksworth
and
examined
him
in
the
glancing
morning
light
her
dark
hair
was
backlighted
now
from
the
sun
streaming
through
the
doorway
her
gauze
head
scarf
glistening
like
spun
gold
yes
you
a
just
like
all
the
rest
her
eyes
flashed
how
many
more
like
you
are
there
in
europe
enough
i
would
guess
to
amuse
our
debauched
governor
forever
i
did
double
the
cape
for
his
amusement
or
yours
what
the
matter
everybody
talks
in
riddles
does
this
room
have
a
library
yes
but
the
writings
are
in
persian
which
you
do
understand
how
do
you
know
what
i
understand
she
looked
at
him
with
open
astonishment
do
you
suppose
anyone
in
the
palace
who
does
already
know
all
about
you
and
what
do
you
know
about
me
silence
held
the
room
for
a
moment
then
she
spoke
i
know
you
a
like
the
portuguese
here
for
gold
and
the
rest
she
turned
and
walked
back
into
the
darkness
there
was
a
spark
of
light
and
the
lamp
glowed
again
as
for
this
room
nothing
here
you
would
understand
and
when
you
return
to
the
palace
and
to
his
excellency
his
remember
what
happens
to
a
man
who
is
discovered
with
another
wife
i
will
forget
i
saw
you
here
you
should
forget
also
if
you
wish
to
see
the
sun
tomorrow
hawksworth
found
himself
watching
her
spellbound
almost
not
hearing
her
words
he
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
then
walked
directly
toward
her
trying
not
to
feel
in
his
new
moghul
clothes
i
want
to
talk
with
you
to
find
out
what
going
on
begin
with
this
place
it
an
observatory
or
was
what
harm
can
there
be
in
looking
around
this
room
she
stared
at
him
without
moving
you
certainly
have
a
manner
if
you
wo
leave
then
i
ask
you
some
questions
what
do
you
say
is
your
reason
for
coming
to
india
it
rumored
you
here
for
the
english
king
what
else
have
you
heard
other
things
as
well
she
moved
closer
and
her
perfume
enveloped
him
her
eyes
were
intense
almost
overwhelming
the
jewel
at
her
throat
but
i
like
to
hear
them
from
you
there
much
dismay
about
you
about
the
battle
about
the
letter
hawksworth
studied
her
wistfully
you
know
about
the
letter
of
course
everyone
knows
she
sighed
at
his
naivete
the
contents
of
your
chest
were
examined
very
carefully
last
night
but
no
one
dared
touch
the
seal
on
the
letter
for
fear
of
the
moghul
is
it
true
the
english
king
may
send
an
armada
to
attack
goa
and
if
it
were
it
could
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
many
people
here
who
people
who
matter
the
only
one
who
should
matter
is
the
moghul
she
laughed
again
he
the
very
last
one
who
matters
i
see
you
comprehend
very
little
she
paused
and
examined
him
closely
but
you
an
interesting
man
we
all
listened
to
you
play
the
english
sitar
last
night
and
today
the
first
place
you
chose
to
come
was
here
you
the
first
ever
to
seek
out
this
place
which
was
once
famous
throughout
india
did
you
truly
come
here
this
morning
just
to
learn
i
have
learned
very
much
so
far
at
least
in
this
room
he
looked
about
them
noticing
for
the
first
time
a
small
table
on
which
there
was
a
book
and
fresh
writings
you
not
told
what
doing
here
or
why
you
can
come
here
when
the
servants
are
forbidden
servants
once
tried
to
steal
some
of
the
marble
steps
for
a
house
but
the
reason
i
come
here
is
not
really
your
concern
captain
hawksworth
she
caught
his
startled
look
and
laughed
of
course
i
know
your
name
i
also
know
you
should
learn
not
to
drink
with
kali
she
more
than
your
equal
hawksworth
stifled
his
embarrassment
and
tried
to
ignore
the
barb
there
surely
must
be
charts
here
what
harm
if
i
merely
look
around
shirin
stiffened
not
now
not
today
you
have
to
leave
but
are
there
calculations
or
charts
more
than
likely
but
i
told
you
they
in
persian
then
maybe
you
could
translate
i
could
but
not
today
i
told
you
you
have
to
leave
really
you
must
she
pushed
the
door
open
wider
and
stood
waiting
i
be
back
he
paused
in
the
doorway
and
turned
will
you
be
here
tomorrow
possibly
then
i
be
back
for
sure
she
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
resignedly
you
truly
do
realize
how
dangerous
it
is
for
you
to
come
here
are
you
afraid
i
always
afraid
you
should
be
too
she
studied
him
in
the
sunshine
examining
his
eyes
and
for
a
moment
her
face
softened
slightly
but
if
you
do
come
will
you
bring
your
english
sitar
like
very
much
to
hear
it
once
more
and
what
will
you
do
for
me
in
return
she
laughed
i
try
to
excavate
some
musty
persian
books
here
that
might
tell
you
something
about
the
observatory
but
remember
no
one
must
ever
know
now
please
she
urged
him
out
then
reached
and
pulled
the
door
tightly
closed
hawksworth
suddenly
realized
the
heat
had
grown
intense
and
now
the
sun
cut
a
sharp
line
down
the
face
of
the
red
marble
dial
telling
that
midmorning
approached
he
examined
the
dial
quickly
and
then
turned
to
look
again
at
the
stone
hut
with
the
door
closed
the
ramshackle
hut
again
looked
completely
deserted
what
in
christ
name
can
she
be
doing
no
matter
she
astonishing
and
there
something
in
the
way
she
handles
herself
little
wonder
she
was
the
favorite
concubine
or
whatever
they
call
it
of
the
moghul
and
it
easy
to
see
why
his
queen
married
her
off
to
mukarrab
khan
and
sent
them
both
here
to
get
her
out
of
the
way
a
clever
way
to
banish
hawksworth
froze
that
the
word
the
pilot
karim
used
from
the
quran
as
for
women
from
whom
you
fear
rebellion
banish
them
to
beds
apart
could
this
be
the
woman
he
meant
but
what
rebellion
whatever
going
on
nobody
talking
all
i
see
are
armed
guards
and
fear
this
palace
is
like
a
and
deadly
he
stared
again
at
the
marble
instruments
but
i
be
back
if
she
be
here
absolutely
nothing
could
stop
me
chapter
nine
the
two
at
the
same
instant
and
pulled
taut
the
chains
on
their
collars
they
were
tawny
indian
hunting
leopards
and
they
rode
in
carpeted
litters
one
on
each
side
of
the
elephant
back
each
wore
a
brocade
saddlecloth
signifying
its
rank
and
now
both
began
to
flick
the
striped
tips
of
their
tails
in
anticipation
prince
jadar
caught
their
motion
and
reined
in
his
dun
stallion
the
bright
morning
sunshine
glanced
off
his
freshly
oiled
olive
skin
and
highlighted
the
crevices
of
his
lean
angular
face
and
his
tightly
trimmed
short
beard
he
wore
a
hunting
turban
secured
with
a
heavy
strand
of
pearls
and
a
dark
green
jacket
emblazoned
with
his
own
royal
crest
his
rajput
guard
had
drawn
alongside
and
their
horses
tossed
their
heads
and
pawed
impatiently
rattling
the
arrows
in
the
brocade
quivers
by
each
man
saddle
then
jadar
spotted
the
large
bovine
indian
deer
grazing
in
a
herd
upwind
near
the
base
of
a
hill
with
a
flick
of
his
hand
he
signaled
the
keepers
who
rode
alongside
the
to
begin
removing
the
leopards
saddlecloths
he
watched
as
first
the
male
and
then
the
female
shook
themselves
and
stretched
their
paws
in
readiness
fifty
rupees
the
male
will
make
the
first
kill
jadar
spoke
quietly
to
vasant
rao
the
moustachioed
young
rajput
captain
who
rode
alongside
the
commander
of
the
prince
personal
guards
he
was
the
only
man
in
india
jadar
trusted
fully
then
give
me
two
hundred
on
the
female
highness
a
hundred
and
half
the
hides
for
your
regiment
shield
maker
jadar
turned
toward
the
waiting
keepers
release
the
female
then
count
to
a
hundred
and
release
the
male
in
moments
the
bulleting
toward
the
unsuspecting
deer
darting
from
bush
to
bush
occasionally
kicking
up
dust
with
their
forefeet
and
hind
legs
to
create
camouflage
then
as
they
approached
the
final
clearing
they
suddenly
parted
the
female
to
the
north
the
male
to
the
south
seconds
later
as
though
on
some
private
signal
the
female
sprang
she
seemed
to
cover
the
remaining
twenty
yards
in
less
than
a
second
and
before
the
she
was
there
she
had
already
pawed
down
a
bleating
straggler
the
striped
ears
of
the
other
erect
at
the
sound
and
the
herd
panicked
sweeping
blindly
away
from
her
and
directly
toward
the
cover
where
the
male
crouched
he
waited
coolly
and
then
as
the
deer
darted
by
pounced
what
followed
was
a
fearsome
devastation
as
he
brought
down
one
after
another
of
the
confused
prey
with
his
powerful
claws
the
female
killed
first
highness
i
assume
our
bet
was
in
gold
coins
not
silver
vasant
rao
laughed
lightly
and
turned
to
study
the
brooding
man
at
his
side
can
it
be
true
what
many
suspect
about
the
prince
he
again
found
himself
wondering
that
he
choses
his
strategy
for
a
campaign
from
the
final
hunt
of
his
but
what
strategy
is
left
for
us
the
deccanis
have
already
reclaimed
the
city
of
ahmadnagar
deep
in
their
territory
and
once
again
made
it
their
rebel
capital
they
drove
the
moghul
garrison
north
to
the
fort
at
burhanpur
and
now
they
threaten
that
city
as
well
the
most
important
station
in
the
vital
route
between
agra
and
surat
we
the
men
and
horse
to
turn
them
back
not
this
time
this
was
prince
jadar
second
campaign
in
the
deccan
india
torn
central
plains
which
lay
far
south
of
agra
and
east
of
the
port
of
surat
and
the
second
time
he
had
led
his
army
to
regain
cities
lost
to
malik
ambar
the
abyssinian
adventurer
and
military
genius
who
periodically
rose
to
lead
the
deccan
against
moghul
rule
the
deccan
had
never
been
secure
even
under
the
moghurs
father
akman
but
under
arangbar
it
had
become
a
burial
ground
of
reputation
one
of
the
moghurs
finest
generals
whose
dispatches
from
ahmadnagar
only
the
previous
year
had
boasted
that
the
deccan
was
finally
subdued
now
cowered
in
the
fortress
at
burhanpur
arangbar
had
no
choice
but
to
send
jadar
again
did
you
see
how
they
planned
their
attack
jadar
fingered
the
edges
of
his
short
beard
then
pointed
she
drove
them
toward
his
trap
by
attacking
the
weak
she
frightened
the
strong
who
flew
to
their
doom
we
not
facing
highness
vasant
rao
shifted
in
his
saddle
to
face
the
prince
and
shielded
his
eyes
against
the
sun
and
our
position
is
much
worse
than
on
the
last
campaign
this
time
we
have
only
eighteen
thousand
men
all
encamped
here
at
ujjain
all
weary
to
their
bones
from
our
siege
at
the
kangra
north
in
the
punjab
and
then
the
long
march
down
country
while
malik
ambar
waits
rested
and
secure
in
ahmadnagar
his
own
capital
a
two
months
march
south
we
bring
ambar
to
terms
just
as
before
three
years
ago
by
fear
jadar
watched
as
the
keepers
began
measuring
the
rations
of
meat
to
reward
the
and
he
reflected
over
the
secret
envoy
received
early
that
morning
from
the
commander
of
the
fortress
at
mandu
the
northern
outpost
of
the
deccan
your
highness
is
respectfully
advised
the
situation
is
worse
much
worse
than
told
in
the
reports
sent
by
ghulam
adl
they
were
alone
in
jadar
tent
and
the
envoy
was
on
his
knees
prostrate
terrified
at
his
obligation
to
bring
ill
tidings
to
the
son
of
the
moghul
ghulam
adl
was
the
general
in
charge
of
the
deccan
who
had
abandoned
ahmadnagar
to
malik
ambar
and
retreated
north
to
burhanpur
his
official
reports
still
maintained
an
air
of
bravado
claiming
a
few
reinforcements
were
all
that
was
required
to
drive
the
rebels
to
final
extinction
we
have
asked
ghulam
adl
for
troops
to
help
defend
mandu
but
he
can
not
leave
burhanpur
the
envoy
continued
the
deccanis
have
surrounded
the
city
but
they
do
not
trouble
themselves
with
a
siege
they
know
he
can
not
move
so
they
have
sent
eight
thousand
light
cavalry
maratha
irregulars
north
across
the
narbada
river
to
plunder
outlying
districts
they
are
approaching
mandu
and
will
be
at
the
fortress
within
the
week
why
does
ghulam
adl
call
up
troops
from
among
the
they
all
been
granted
their
annual
allowance
for
maintenance
of

it
please
your
highness
the
envoy
face
was
buried
in
the
carpet
showing
to
jadar
only
the
back
of
his
turban
conditions
have
been
severe
over
the
past
year
crops
have
been
bad
and
many
not
collect
taxes
because
of
the
deccani
raids
many
have
not
paid

over
a

that
have
been
branded
and
placed
in
their

they
have
not

the

who
must
ride
most
of
those
have
returned
to
their
villages
there
can
be
no
army
without
coin
to
lure
them
back
the
fearful
of
malik
ambar
now
and
many
have
secretly
agreed
with
him
not
to
muster
even
the
troops
they
still
have
how
many

are
encamped
around

no

than
five
thousand

still
remaining
loyal
and
his

are
short
jadar
had
ordered
immediate
solitary
confinement
for
the
envoy
lest
the
news
reach
the
camp
now
watching
his
he
calculated
his
next
move
i
have
to
requisition
silver
coin
from
the
treasury
at
agra
and
hope
a
supply
caravan
can
still
get
through
in
the
meantime
i
muster
the
remaining
cavalry
from
the
on
the
threat
their
will
be
confiscated
if
they
fail
to
deliver
it
wo
raise
many
men
but
it
will
slow
defections
but
if
we
to
recall
the
men
still
loyal
we
must
have
silver
to
raise
the
thirty
thousand
men
we
need
men
who
not
been
paid
for
a
year
will
require
at
least
five
million
rupees
fifty
i
must
have
it
by
the
time
we
reach
burhanpur
if
we
can
hold
that
city
we
can
raise
the
army
from
there
malik
ambar
sued
for
peace
three
years
ago
because
his
alliance
came
apart
vasant
rao
spoke
again
watching
jadar
carefully
knowing
that
the
prince
was
deeply
troubled
had
imprisoned
a
courier
that
very
morning
for
which
there
could
only
be
one
reason
then
released
pigeons
that
flew
north
and
his
alliance
will
come
apart
again
if
we
sow
enough
fear
jadar
seemed
annoyed
at
the
delay
as
the
waiting
and
the
last
carcasses
of
blue
loaded
onto
the
wagons
for
return
to
the
camp
you
still
have
learned
to
think
like
a
jadar
signaled
the
hunt
was
finished
and
wheeled
his
horse
back
toward
the
camp
vasant
rao
rode
a
few
paces
behind
asking
himself
how
long
that
regal
head
would
remain
on
those
royal
shoulders
you
threatened
now
on
every
side
you
can
not
be
as
oblivious
as
you
seem
he
thought
back
over
prince
jadar
career
of
the
moghul
four
sons
prince
jadar
was
the
obvious
one
to
succeed
jadar
elder
brother
khusrav
had
been
blinded
by
the
moghul
years
before
for
attempting
a
palace
revolt
jadar
brother
parwaz
also
older
than
the
prince
was
a
notorious
drunkard
and
unacceptably
dissolute
even
by
the
lax
standards
of
the
moghul
court
and
jadar
younger
brother
allaudin
was
the
handsome
but
witless
son
of
a
concubine
who
well
deserved
his
secret
nickname
the
since
there
was
no
law
in
india
that
the
oldest
must
automatically
succeed
power
devolved
to
the
fittest
only
jadar
son
of
a
royal
rajput
mother
could
lead
an
army
or
rule
india
among
the
moghul
four
sons
he
was
the
obvious
deserving
heir
but
ability
alone
was
never
enough
to
ensure
success
in
the
mire
of
palace
intrigue
one
must
also
have
a
powerful
friend
for
years
prince
jadar
had
the
most
powerful
friend
of
all
the
grooming
of
jadar
for
office
had
begun
over
five
years
earlier
when
he
was
taken
under
the
protection
of
queen
janahara
she
had
made
herself
the
guardian
of
jadar
interests
at
court
and
two
years
ago
she
had
induced
the
moghul
to
elevate
jadar
his
honorary
rank
to
twelve
thousand
in
income
and
prestige
he
had
soared
far
beyond
his
brothers
as
is
always
the
case
jadar
was
expected
to
repay
his
obligation
on
the
day
he
ascended
to
the
throne
and
assumed
power
from
the
ailing
arangbar
he
was
expected
to
share
that
power
with
queen
janahara
but
their
unofficial
alliance
had
begun
to
go
wrong
very
wrong
and
what
had
gone
wrong
was
the
most
obvious
problem
of
all
jadar
had
lived
half
his
life
in
army
camps
fighting
the
moghul
wars
because
he
was
the
only
son
who
could
fight
them
and
he
no
longer
saw
any
reason
to
relinquish
his
inheritance
to
the
queen
what
will
the
queen
do
vasant
rao
asked
himself
again
i
know
she
has
turned
on
the
prince
i
know
she
tried
to
marry
her
persian
daughter
to
jadar
blinded
brother
khusrav
but
jadar
discovered
this
and
demanded
khusrav
be
sent
out
of
agra
to
be
kept
in
confinement
by
a
raja
loyal
to
the
prince
but
the
queen
is
still
in
agra
and
sooner
or
later
she
will
produce
another
successor
a
creature
she
can
dominate
her
task
will
be
easy
if
jadar
fails
in
this
campaign
i
have
reports
maratha
irregulars
may
be
at
the
fort
at
mandu
within
a
week
jadar
broke
the
silence
between
them
as
they
rode
the
noisy
rajput
horsemen
rode
discreetly
well
behind
cursing
laughing
wagering
the
flawless
blue
sky
seemed
to
cloud
as
jadar
spoke
tell
me
what
you
would
do
strike
camp
and
march
south
we
have
no
choice
sometimes
you
rajputs
show
less
wit
than
your
monkey
god
hanumanji
jadar
laughed
you
learned
nothing
from
the
hunt
today
do
you
see
that
would
merely
scatter
them
they
never
dare
meet
us
if
we
march
in
force
they
only
stage
small
raids
harass
our
baggage
train
no
we
must
do
just
the
opposite
jadar
reined
in
his
horse
turned
to
vasant
rao
and
lowered
his
voice
think
like
a
once
not
like
an
impulsive
rajput
we
send
a
small
cavalry
force
only
five
hundred
horse
you
will
help
me
pick
them
who
will
disperse
ride
separately
never
show
their
numbers
like
a
no
supply
contingent
no
elephants
no
wagons
and
after
the
marathas
have
set
their
siege
at
mandu
our
cavalry
will
quietly
group
and
attack
their
flank
as
they
fall
back
which
they
always
do
when
facing
a
disciplined
unit
the
cavalry
in
the
fort
will
ride
out
in
force
forming
the
second
arm
of
a
pincer
and
that
will
be
the
last
we
see
of
malik
ambar
famous
maratha
irregulars
return
to
pillaging
baggage
trains
and
helpless
villages
and
after
that
we
march
directly
on
burhanpur
we
should
reach
it
in
less
than
a
month
the
marathas
will
begin
to
harass
our
supply
trains
as
soon
as
we
cross
the
narbada
river
if
they
do
attack
us
while
we
cross
after
mandu
that
the
one
thing
they
will
not
do
remember
the
the
marathas
will
never
know
where
our
mandu
cavalry
may
be
waiting
in
ambush
and
when
we
reach
burhanpur
we
make
our
camp
there
and
muster
cavalry
from
all
the
jadar
passed
over
how
he
intended
to
do
this
that
will
be
the
end
of
ambar
many
alliances
we
have
the
men
we
need
to
march
in
force
on
the
south
on
to
ahmadnagar
within
the
week
and
malik
ambar
will
sue
for
peace
and
return
the
territory
he
seized
just
like
before
vasant
rao
nodded
in
silent
acknowledgment
asking
himself
what
the
prince
was
withholding
the
strategy
was
far
too
straightforward
for
jadar
the
camp
was
coming
into
view
now
a
vast
movable
city
it
was
easily
several
miles
in
circuit
even
from
afar
however
jadar
massive
central
tent
dominated
it
was
bright
red
and
stationed
in
the
center
of
the
a
restricted
central
zone
almost
two
hundred
yards
on
the
side
that
formed
the
focal
point
of
the
camp
behind
tent
separated
by
a
figured
satin
partition
were
the
red
chintz
tents
of
the
women
where
his
first
wife
mumtaz
and
her
attendants
stayed
directly
in
front
of
jadar
tent
was
a
canopied
platform
with
four
massive
corner
pillars
called
the
where
jadar
held
private
briefings
the
entire
sealed
from
common
view
by
a
high
cloth
wall
near
the
entrance
to
jadar
enclosure
was
the
camp
artillery
including
the
cannon
and
the
tents
of
the
lead
horses
and
war
elephants
its
entry
was
guarded
by
mounted
horsemen
and
next
to
these
were
the
tents
for
jadar
leopards
around
the
perimeter
were
the
striped
tents
of
the
nobles
and
officers
whose
respective
colors
flew
above
for
easy
identification
and
spreading
out
from
each
officer
tent
were
the
tents
of
his
men
their
wives
and
their
bazaar
the
camp
itself
was
laid
out
with
such
consistent
precision
that
a
soldier
might
easily
find
his
tent
in
total
darkness
regardless
of
where
the
army
might
be
as
jadar
dismounted
at
the
entry
to
the
gulal
bar
and
strode
toward
his
tent
his
mind
sorted
through
the
moves
that
lay
ahead
he
had
notified
the
moghul
of
the
envoy
secret
report
and
asked
for
five
million
rupees
in
silver
coin
it
was
the
price
for
the
deccan
surely
he
could
not
refuse
arangbar
own
administrators
who
were
supposed
to
monitor
the
mansabdars
were
to
blame
there
were
also
other
new
and
disquieting
complexities
word
had
come
through
surat
only
the
day
before
that
the
portuguese
were
secretly
planning
to
arm
malik
ambar
why
it
was
common
knowledge
they
feared
and
hated
jadar
because
he
distrusted
all
christians
and
said
so
and
they
certainly
were
aware
that
if
he
should
someday
unite
the
infested
province
of
gujarat
where
their
ports
of
daimon
and
diu
were
situated
he
would
undoubtedly
try
to
regain
these
ports
for
india
but
they
would
not
dare
to
openly
or
even
secretly
support
rebels
within
the
moghul
empire
unless
they
were
sure
there
would
be
no
reprisals
from
agra
which
meant
they
had
powerful
accomplices
in
court
accomplices
who
would
venture
to
endanger
the
empire
itself
to
ruin
jadar
whose
interests
in
agra
were
served
if
the
deccan
remained
in
turmoil
if
jadar
were
kept
occupied
and
harried
in
the
south
the
question
virtually
answered
itself
if
this
were
not
perplexing
enough
news
had
arrived
two
days
before
telling
of
an
incredible
incident
two
merchant
frigates
of
another
european
nation
calling
themselves
english
had
appeared
off
the
bar
of
surat
and
humiliated
four
portuguese
warships
jadar
had
released
pigeons
for
surat
immediately
ordering
that
the
english
be
protected
until
he
could
determine
their
intentions
the
dispatch
received
the
following
morning
yesterday
reported
that
his
orders
had
been
timely
a
portuguese
ambush
of
the
english
as
they
came
up
the
tapti
river
had
been
averted
by
rajputs
using
arrows
stolen
from
the
governor
own
guard
and
this
morning
there
had
been
another
message
from
surat
with
news
that
the
governor
had
sent
the
moghul
a
dispatch
claiming
credit
for
the
action
this
only
after
he
discovered
the
english
captain
had
gifts
for
arangbar
but
who
knew
the
intentions
of
the
captain
of
this
english
fleet
or
the
content
of
a
letter
he
had
brought
for
the
moghul
reports
said
only
that
he
was
quartered
in
the
governor
palace
where
he
could
no
longer
be
protected
his
eunuchs
bowed
and
relayed
an
urgent
message
from
mumtaz
his
wife
begged
to
receive
his
highness
the
moment
he
returned
without
entering
his
own
tent
jadar
proceeded
through
the
circle
of
guards
protecting
the
women
quarters
mumtaz
was
waiting
surrounded
by
two
of
her
women
and
the
midwife
she
was
almost
to
term
with
jadar
third
child
the
first
two
had
been
daughters
his
first
thought
when
he
saw
her
was
that
this
birth
must
be
male
merciful
allah
make
this
a
son
mumtaz
gleaming
black
hair
had
been
tightly
braided
and
she
wore
a
shawl
and
trousers
of
silk
she
had
a
pronounced
fondness
for
gold
and
silk
few
other
luxuries
were
to
be
found
in
the
army
camps
that
had
been
her
home
for
most
of
their
marriage
features
were
delicate
with
high
persian
cheeks
and
she
was
well
over
thirty
the
age
at
which
most
muslim
women
ceased
to
interest
their
mates
but
she
had
found
ways
to
remain
the
center
of
jadar
life
if
not
dominate
it
the
flash
of
her
eyes
told
jadar
she
was
in
an
extreme
temper
pigeons
arrived
just
after
you
left
the
report
from
agra
is
astonishing
what
do
you
mean
do
you
and
your
women
receive
my
dispatches
now
which
are
rarely
worth
the
bother
no
i
receive
my
own
from
father
mumtaz
was
the
daughter
of
nadir
sharif
prime
minister
of
the
moghul
empire
and
brother
of
queen
janahara
i
had
the
sense
to
leave
him
pigeons
for
here
at
ujjain
and
also
for
burhanpur
which
may
prove
to
be
vital
for
you
assuming
that
city
is
not
overrun
by
deccanis
by
the
time
you
reach
it
what
message
did
nadir
sharif
ever
send
that
was
dictated
by
our
noble
queen
you
a
fool
not
to
trust
him
but
you
do
well
to
begin
and
soon
mumtaz
eyes
snapped
momentary
fire
matching
the
hard
red
jewel
on
her
forehead
and
she
eased
herself
slowly
onto
a
velvet
bolster
to
lighten
the
weight
of
the
child
i
think
you
discover
your
many
friends
may
be
difficult
to
find
if
we
ever
return
to
the
capital
come
to
the
point
i
want
to
see
into
their
tent
they
killed
well
today
jadar
was
always
amused
by
mumtaz
temper
he
had
long
ago
despaired
of
receiving
proper
respect
from
her
she
defied
him
exactly
the
way
janahara
defied
the
moghul
and
he
delighted
in
it
perhaps
all
persian
wives
were
incorrigible
perhaps
it
was
a
racial
trait
very
well
you
should
be
pleased
to
know
that
his
majesty
has
already
forgotten
you
exist
he
has
agreed
to
the
queen
outrageous
scheme
an
affront
to
sense
but
it
will
be
the
end
of
you
nonetheless
agreed
to
what
the
very
marriage
i
warned
you
about
but
you
would
listen
you
were
too
clever
yes
you
were
brilliant
you
sent
the
wrong
brother
away
from
agra
you
sent
khusrav
the
competent
one
you
should
have
sent
allaudin
i
do
believe
it
i
do
and
i
told
you
it
would
happen
the
queen
has
foisted
her
scrawny
offspring
the
simpering
princess
layla
onto
allaudin
but
it
the
perfect
match
the
moghul
youngest
son
the
notorious
betrothed
to
that
fumbling
little
sparrow
both
weak
and
useless
what
could
allaudin
possibly
do
even
arangbar
realizes
incompetent
but
arangbar
will
soon
be
dead
so
what
he
knows
wo
matter
perfect
for
the
queen
she
rule
them
both
in
the
meantime
make
sure
you
nowhere
near
agra
your
next
appointment
will
probably
be
the
punjab
or
perhaps
the
himalayas
where
you
can
chase
yak
with
your
leopards
mumtaz
could
scarcely
contain
her
anger
and
frustration
the
time
will
come
and
soon
when
the
moghul
will
chance
his
twenty
glasses
of
wine
and
his
twelve
grains
of
opium
one
night
too
many
and
the
next
day
while
you
somewhere
sporting
with
your
she
summon
her
lackey
general
inayat
latif
and
his
bengal
agra
and
declare
allaudin
the
next
moghul
jadar
was
stunned
allaudin
was
incapable
of
anything
except
bowing
to
the
queen
orders
like
a
hand
puppet
once
moghul
he
certainly
could
not
rule
she
would
rule
for
him
or
probably
eliminate
him
entirely
after
a
few
months
so
janahara
had
finally
made
her
move
to
challenge
prince
jadar
the
son
who
had
earned
the
throne
for
his
rightful
place
the
battle
had
been
joined
so
what
do
you
propose
to
do
she
waited
just
long
enough
to
trap
you
in
the
deccan
mumtaz
fury
was
turning
to
despair
if
you
go
back
now
you
be
accused
of
abandoning
burhanpur
if
you
march
on
south
you
be
unable
to
return
for
months
and
by
that
time
allaudin
will
be
married
father
said
she
has
convinced
the
moghul
to
give
him
a
personal
mansab
rank
of
eight
thousand
a
horse
rank
of
four
thousand
allaudin
who
scarcely
knows
a
bow
from
a
wine
bowl
will
now
have
his
own
cavalry
jadar
was
looking
at
her
but
he
no
longer
heard
this
changes
everything
there
be
no
silver
the
queen
will
see
to
that
and
no
silver
means
no
troops
can
be
recalled
from
the
deccan
which
means
we
lose
the
deccan
but
she
gladly
give
the
deccan
to
destroy
me
jadar
looked
at
mumtaz
and
smiled
yes
i
must
do
something
but
right
now
i
see
my
and
he
turned
and
strode
briskly
back
toward
his
tent
a
dense
mantle
of
evening
smoke
enveloped
the
camp
as
the
three
generals
passed
through
the
entry
of
the
gulal
bar
they
advanced
to
the
front
of
the
sarachah
platform
and
halted
to
wait
for
jadar
each
had
brought
a
silver
cup
as
jadar
had
instructed
all
three
were
seasoned
military
leaders
abdullah
khan
a
young
moghul
warrior
had
been
promoted
to
a
rank
of
three
thousand
the
successful
siege
at
the
northern
fortress
of
kangra
under
the
prince
he
had
risen
from
the
rank
of
foot
soldier
to
cavalry
and
now
he
commanded
his
own
division
the
next
was
abul
hasan
a
afghan
strategist
with
rank
of
five
thousand
who
had
led
prince
jadar
to
his
first
victory
in
the
deccan
three
years
before
finally
there
was
raja
a
bearded
rajput
of
royal
blood
who
led
the
hindus
he
scorned
matchlocks
and
fought
only
with
his
sword
and
he
was
the
bravest
man
in
battle
that
jadar
had
ever
known
moments
later
prince
jadar
emerged
through
the
smoke
carrying
his
heavy
sword
and
accompanied
by
vasant
rao
a
servant
trailed
after
them
bearing
a
crystal
decanter
of
wine
and
two
silver
goblets
on
a
tray
the
prince
assumed
his
seat
in
the
center
of
the
platform
and
ordered
the
servant
to
place
the
decanter
on
a
small
table
by
his
side
then
he
motioned
away
the
servant
and
all
the
surrounding
guards
i
propose
we
all
take
a
glass
of
wine
to
clear
our
thoughts
persian
and
i
had
it
cooled
in
the
saltpeter
tent
especially
for
this
evening
jadar
personally
poured
wine
for
each
of
the
men
then
filled
the
two
goblets
on
the
tray
for
vasant
rao
and
for
himself
i
hereby
propose
a
toast
to
ahmadnagar
which
malik
ambar
now
calls
his
own
capital
and
to
its
recapture
within
a
hundred
days
the
men
raised
their
goblets
and
drank
in
silence
skepticism
filled
their
eyes
jadar
looked
at
them
and
smiled
you
do
not
agree
then
let
me
tell
you
more
the
situation
is
very
bad
how
bad
even
you
do
not
yet
know
but
battles
are
more
than
a
matter
of
numbers
they
are
a
test
of
the
will
to
win
that
why
i
called
you
here
tonight
jadar
paused
but
first
is
the
wine
to
your
liking
the
men
nodded
silent
assent
good
drink
deeply
for
none
of
us
will
drink
again
until
we
drink
in
ahmadnagar
now
i
will
take
your
cups
jadar
reached
for
each
man
cup
individually
and
placed
them
in
a
row
alongside
the
tray
together
with
his
own
and
that
of
vasant
rao
then
he
laid
his
own
cup
on
its
side
on
the
tray
and
slowly
drew
his
heavy
sword
from
its
scabbard
with
a
fierce
swing
he
sliced
the
cup
in
half
then
the
next
cup
and
the
next
until
all
were
destroyed
the
men
watched
him
spellbound
assemble
your
ranks
in
the
bazaar
at
midnight
in
full
battle
dress
i
will
address
them
and
at
dawn
we
march
jadar
rose
and
as
quickly
as
he
had
come
disappeared
into
the
darkness
battle
gear
helmets
buckles
pikes
swords
muskets
glistened
in
the
torchlight
as
jadar
rode
a
fully
armored
war
elephant
slowly
down
the
center
of
the
main
bazaar
the
bristling
infantry
arrayed
in
rows
on
either
side
watched
him
expectantly
a
midnight
muster
was
unheard
of
but
rumors
had
already
swept
the
camp
telling
of
the
pending
marriage
of
the
queen
daughter
to
allaudin
all
knew
jadar
had
been
betrayed
and
with
him
all
of
them
as
well
then
they
noticed
carts
following
him
with
barrels
of
wine
from
jadar
tent
when
the
prince
reached
the
center
of
the
bazaar
he
raised
his
arms
for
silence
for
a
moment
all
that
could
be
heard
was
the
neigh
of
horses
from
the
stables
and
the
cries
of
infants
in
the
far
reaches
of
the
camp
he
began
in
urdu
a
hybrid
camp
tongue
of
persian
and
hindi
his
voice
ringing
toward
abul
hassan
muslim
troops
tonight
we
are
many
jadar
paused
deliberately
but
in
battle
the
many
are
nothing
in
battle
there
is
only
the
one
each
of
you
is
that
one
again
a
pause
then
he
shouted
in
a
voice
that
carried
to
the
far
hills
is
there
a
believer
among
us
tonight
who
would
fight
to
the
death
for
our
victory
a
roar
of
assent
sounded
from
the
men
will
you
swear
it
on
the
holy
quran
this
time
the
roar
shook
the
tent
poles
of
the
bazaar
is
there
one
who
would
not
silence
suddenly
jadar
turned
to
the
troops
of
moghul
lineage
and
switched
his
language
to
exquisite
persian
some
here
tonight
swear
to
embrace
death
itself
for
our
victory
but
i
know
not
the
will
of
all
is
there
among
you
a
man
who
would
give
his
life
for
us
again
a
roar
of
assent
what
man
will
swear
it
the
roar
seemed
to
envelop
the
camp
without
pausing
jadar
turned
to
the
rajput
contingent
addressing
them
easily
in
their
native
rajasthani
does
any
among
you
know
how
to
fight
cheers
does
any
know
how
to
die
more
cheers
and
then
the
rajputs
began
banging
their
swords
on
their
bucklers
jadar
bellowed
above
the
sudden
dim
i
know
hindus
can
not
take
an
oath
but
if
you
could
would
it
be
to
fight
to
the
death
for
our
victory
bedlam
seized
the
camp
and
the
chant
jadar
is
great
swept
through
the
ranks
jadar
let
the
chant
continue
for
a
time
and
as
he
listened
he
saw
that
mumtaz
and
her
women
had
appeared
at
the
gateway
of
the
gulal
bar
as
he
had
instructed
them
all
activity
had
ceased
in
the
camp
and
even
in
the
far
background
the
women
had
gathered
in
the
shadows
of
the
tents
listening
intently
then
jadar
motioned
for
silence
and
continued
tonight
we
each
will
make
a
pledge
i
to
you
you
to
me
first
my
pledge
to
you
jadar
commanded
his
elephant
to
kneel
and
he
dismounted
and
walked
directly
to
the
waiting
wagons
containing
his
wine
barrels
he
was
handed
a
battle
axe
and
with
a
powerful
overhand
swing
he
shattered
the
first
barrel
then
he
signaled
his
waiting
guard
and
in
moments
every
barrel
had
been
axed
the
center
of
the
bazaar
ran
red
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
wine
sweet
persian
perfume
then
he
motioned
toward
the
entry
of
the
bar
his
women
emerged
followed
by
an
elephant
whose
the
livery
on
its
back
was
filled
with
silver
utensils
when
the
procession
reached
the
clearing
where
jadar
stood
the
elephant
mahout
commanded
it
to
kneel
without
a
word
jadar
walked
directly
to
the
as
though
meeting
an
enemy
in
ambush
he
suddenly
drew
his
long
sword
and
swung
it
through
the
livery
leaving
a
wide
gash
in
its
embroidered
side
a
glittering
array
of
silver
and
gold
plate
goblets
jewelry
poured
onto
the
ground
with
a
single
motion
he
sheathed
the
sword
and
again
took
the
axe
while
the
assembled
camp
watched
spellbound
he
quickly
methodically
smashed
each
of
the
silver
and
gold
objects
into
small
shreds
then
he
broke
the
silver
handle
of
the
axe
and
again
mounted
the
elephant
my
pledge
to
you
his
voice
pierced
the
stunned
silence
of
the
camp
as
he
repeated
each
sentence
in
three
languages
my
pledge
to
you
is
not
to
touch
wine
not
to
lie
with
women
not
to
look
on
silver
or
gold
until
we
have
taken
ahmadnagar
the
camp
seemed
to
come
apart
with
the
cheer
that
followed
and
again
came
the
chant
the
sound
was
as
one
voice
and
now
even
the
distant
hills
echoed
back
the
sound
again
jadar
stopped
them
your
pledge
to
me
must
be
the
same
and
together
we
will
take
ahmadnagar
in
a
hundred
days
by
the
head
of
the
prophet
i
swear
it
to
you
again
the
chant
and
again
jadar
stopped
them
tonight
i
offer
to
fight
for
you
you
must
be
ready
to
fight
for
me
and
each
must
hold
the
other
to
his
pledge
more
cheers
i
have
spilled
my
wine
i
will
stay
apart
from
my
women
i
have
smashed
my
gold
and
silver
i
will
give
it
to
you
each
tent
will
have
a
shard
but
my
eyes
must
never
see
it
again
the
roar
of
approval
was
deafening
that
is
my
pledge
you
must
also
give
me
yours
leave
your
women
in
their
tents
and
lie
beside
me
under
the
stars
empty
your
wine
flasks
into
the
narbada
river
as
we
cross
as
your
oath
to
fight
to
the
death
and
all
your
silver
that
of
your
vessels
that
on
your
saddles
that
on
your
women
must
be
brought
here
tonight
mark
it
with
your
seal
and
leave
it
under
guard
in
my
own
wagons
away
from
all
eyes
until
the
day
we
reach
ahmadnagar
then
we
will
drink
wine
we
will
have
women
we
will
wear
our
finest
in
victory
jadar
paused
dramatically
tonight
we
are
many
tomorrow
we
are
one
we
march
at
sunrise
the
cheers
began
again
and
immediately
the
pile
of
silver
started
to
grow
muslim
nobles
began
bringing
saddles
plates
even
jewelry
but
the
most
silver
came
from
the
hindu
infantry
as
their
women
were
stripped
of
the
silver
bracelets
and
massive
silver
anklets
that
had
been
their
dowries
jadar
sat
unmoving
on
his
elephant
as
the
men
began
to
come
forward
with
items
of
silver
soon
there
was
a
line
stretching
into
the
dark
of
the
tents
he
watched
the
pile
growing
and
his
calculations
began
will
it
be
enough
the
weight
must
be
enough
or
the
shahbandar
motherless
thief
that
he
is
will
never
agree
but
i
think
we
will
have
it
he
thought
back
over
the
plan
it
had
required
almost
the
entire
afternoon
to
refine
but
when
he
had
convinced
himself
that
it
would
succeed
he
had
posted
the
pigeons
to
surat
where
he
had
asked
himself
can
i
find
fifty
lakhs
of
silver
five
million
rupees
within
a
month
and
have
them
at
burhanpur
when
we
arrive
i
not
squeeze
a
copper
penny
from
agra
if
not
agra
where
and
slowly
in
his
mind
a
form
had
taken
shape
he
had
examined
it
almost
touched
it
puzzled
over
it
and
then
he
knew
what
it
was
the
mint
at
surat
where
foreign
coin
is
melted
and
recast
as
rupees
fifty
lakhs
of
silver
rupees
would
scarcely
be
missed
especially
if
the
shahbandar
would
allow
his
minters
to
work
a
normal
day
the
backlog
of
foreign
coin
he
holds
unmelted
creating
an
artificial
shortage
of
silver
would
easily
cover
fifty
lakhs
of
rupees
i
need
only
borrow
what
i
need
and
with
it
buy
back
into
service
the
cavalry
i
need
to
reclaim
the
deccan
the
shahbandar
but
will
he
do
it
he
will
if
i
can
show
him
collateral
i
do
have
enough
collateral
not
in
my
own
funds
not
even
in
the
local
treasuries
but
there
must
be
enough
silver
in
eighteen
thousand
tents
to
assemble
five
million
rupees
i
will
hold
it
and
give
him
a
note
of
obligation
using
it
as
collateral
if
we
reach
ahmadnagar
i
will
squeeze
the
five
million
rupees
many
times
over
from
every
traitorous
do
not
hang
i
will
confiscate
their
estates
and
let
them
buy
them
back
i
can
easily
confiscate
enough
to
return
the
shahbandar
his
loan
and
then
my
men
will
have
back
their
silver
if
we
do
not
reach
ahmadnagar
it
will
be
because
we
are
dead
so
what
will
it
matter
we
will
make
an
oath
to
reach
the
city
or
die
only
one
problem
remains
how
to
move
the
coin
from
surat
to
burhanpur
secretly
no
one
must
know
where
it
came
from
or
that
it
being
transferred
but
a
train
with
fifty
lakhs
of
rupees
must
be
heavily
guarded
and
the
guards
will
betray
its
value
unless
there
can
be
some
other
reason
for
a
heavily
guarded
train
from
surat
to
burhanpur
a
reason
that
would
not
automatically
evoke
suspicion
possibly
a
person
of
importance
someone
whom
all
india
knows
can
not
be
touched
someone
important
to
the
moghul
and
then
the
perfect
answer
came
the
most
obvious
answer
of
all
who
will
soon
be
traveling
from
surat
to
burhanpur
en
route
to
agra
under
safe
conduct
of
the
moghul
the
englishman
the
infidel
never
know
that
with
him
will
be
the
silver
that
will
save
prince
jadar
chapter
ten
brian
hawksworth
stepped
lightly
off
the
prow
of
the
barge
as
it
eased
into
the
riverbank
and
worked
his
way
through
the
tidal
mud
onto
the
sandy
shore
even
here
across
the
harbor
the
water
still
stank
of
the
sewers
of
surat
then
he
turned
and
surveyed
the
sprawling
city
back
across
the
broad
estuary
astonished
that
they
could
have
crossed
the
harbor
so
easily
on
nothing
more
substantial
than
a
wide
raft
of
boards
lashed
with
rope
what
the
indians
called
a
bark
ahead
waiting
on
the
shore
was
a
line
of
loaded
bullock
carts
conveyances
with
two
wooden
wheels
higher
than
a
man
head
a
flat
bed
some
six
feet
wide
and
a
heavy
bamboo
pole
for
a
tongue
each
yoked
to
two
tall
humpbacked
gray
cattle
with
conspicuous
ribs
the
carts
stretched
down
the
muddy
road
that
emerged
from
the
tangle
of
coastal
scrub
and
were
piled
to
overflowing
with
rolls
of
english
wool
cloth
the
turbaned
drivers
now
shouted
hindi
obscenities
as
they
walked
alongside
and
lashed
the
sullen
cattle
into
place
for
unloading
as
hawksworth
watched
the
porters
who
had
ridden
with
him
splashed
their
way
toward
the
shore
and
began
driving
stakes
to
secure
the
mooring
lines
of
the
bark
wool
would
be
ferried
across
the
harbor
and
cotton
brought
back
with
each
trip
then
hawksworth
caught
sight
of
george
elkington
ragged
hat
bobbing
in
the
midday
sunshine
as
the
chief
merchant
and
his
aide
humphrey
spencer
climbed
down
from
their
indian
coach
drawn
by
two
white
oxen
which
had
been
loaned
by
shahbandar
farther
down
the
line
of
carts
was
a
detail
of
english
seamen
led
by
mackintosh
and
all
carrying
muskets
who
had
walked
the
trek
to
guard
the
cargo
the
trading
season
was
well
underway
and
over
the
past
three
weeks
a
motley
assemblage
of
cargo
vessels
from
the
length
of
the
indian
ocean
had
appeared
downriver
at
the
bar
to
commence
unlading
foreign
traders
normally
transported
goods
inland
to
surat
on
the
barks
that
plied
the
tapti
between
the
port
and
the
shallow
bar
at
the
river
mouth
but
these
vessels
had
arrived
at
the
bar
with
the
blessings
of
portugal
for
they
all
had
acquired
a
portuguese
license
and
paid
duty
on
their
cargo
at
some
tax
point
after
evaluating
the
risk
of
exposing
his
english
frigates
at
the
bar
where
maneuverability
was
limited
and
the
possibility
of
portuguese
surprise
great
brian
hawksworth
had
elected
to
unlade
directly
onshore
from
their
protected
anchorage
north
of
the
river
mouth
the
cove
called
swalley
then
haul
the
goods
overland
to
the
banks
of
the
tapti
opposite
surat
there
would
be
no
risk
of
portuguese
interference
inland
and
once
across
from
the
port
the
goods
could
be
easily
barged
to
the
he
turned
again
toward
the
river
and
examined
the
town
of
surat
from
his
new
vantage
it
was
easy
to
see
now
why
this
location
had
been
chosen
for
the
port
for
here
the
river
curved
and
widened
creating
a
natural
protected
harbor
the
most
conspicuous
landmarks
visible
from
across
the
harbor
were
three
stone
villas
along
the
riverfront
all
owned
by
the
shahbandar
and
the
square
stone
fort
that
stood
on
the
downriver
side
of
the
harbor
its
heavy
ordnance
trained
perpetually
on
the
water
the
fort
was
surrounded
by
a
moat
on
three
sides
and
on
the
fourth
by
the
river
entry
could
only
be
gained
through
a
gate
on
the
riverside
or
a
drawbridge
that
connected
its
entrance
to
the
open
the
square
where
traders
congregated
the
square
had
swarmed
with
merchants
and
brokers
as
they
passed
through
and
he
had
watched
as
two
brokers
stood
together
near
its
center
one
from
ahmedabad
and
the
other
from
surat
arguing
loudly
over
the
price
and
quality
of
a
pile
of
indigo
the
porters
explained
that
the
surat
broker
was
accusing
the
other
of
mixing
sand
with
the
indigo
to
increase
its
weight
then
disguising
his
deception
by
also
adding
enough
oil
that
the
indigo
would
still
float
on
water
the
test
used
to
establish
purity
of
the
dried
extract
of
the
indigo
leaf
as
the
argument
grew
more
vigorous
hawksworth
noticed
the
men
join
hands
beneath
a
piece
of
cloth
where
they
began
negotiating
the
actual
price
by
means
of
their
fingers
a
figure
undoubtedly
little
related
to
the
movement
of
their
tongues
now
that
the
high
trading
season
of
had
begun
surat
narrow
streets
were
one
loud
bazaar
swollen
to
almost
two
hundred
thousand
grasping
traders
bargaining
seamen
hawking
merchants
a
dozen
languages
stirred
the
air
as
a
motley
mélange
of
country
indian
traders
arabs
jains
parsis
persians
jews
egyptians
portuguese
and
returning
muslim
pilgrims
every
nationality
known
to
the
indian
ocean
swaggered
through
the
mud
paths
called
streets
hawksworth
gazed
back
at
the
city
and
reflected
over
the
curious
events
of
the
past
three
weeks
the
english
had
inexplicably
been
received
first
with
open
hostility
and
then
with
suspiciously
cordial
deference
first
by
the
governor
and
afterward
by
the
shahbandar
something
is
very
wrong
he
told
himself
a
contest
of
wills
is
underway
between
the
shahbandar
mirza
nuruddin
and
the
governor
mukarrab
khan
and
so
far
mukarrab
khan
seems
to
be
winning
or
is
he
six
days
before
the
governor
had
suddenly
reversed
his
policy
of
noninterference
in
port
affairs
and
authorized
a
license
for
the
english
to
sell
their
cargo
in
surat
and
buy
indian
goods
something
the
shahbandar
had
found
one
excuse
after
another
to
delay
however
mukarrab
khan
had
delivered
this
license
directly
to
the
english
rather
than
forwarding
it
to
the
shahbandar
through
normal
channels
leaving
brian
hawksworth
the
unpleasant
responsibility
of
presenting
this
document
to
the
shahbandar
in
person
but
the
meeting
turned
out
to
be
nothing
like
hawksworth
had
expected
once
more
you
astound
me
captain
the
close
chamber
of
the
customs
house
office
had
fallen
expectantly
silent
as
the
shahbandar
drew
slowly
on
his
hookah
and
squinted
with
his
opaque
glassy
eyes
at
the
black
seal
of
mukarrab
khan
affixed
to
the
top
of
the
page
hawksworth
had
waited
for
a
glimmer
of
anger
at
this
insulting
breach
of
port
protocol
which
surely
was
mukarrab
reason
for
insisting
the
license
be
delivered
by
the
english
general
but
the
shahbandar
eyes
never
lost
their
noncommittal
squint
instead
he
had
turned
to
hawksworth
with
a
cordial
smile
your
refusal
to
negotiate
seems
to
have
worked
remarkable
dispatch
with
his
excellency
officials
i
ca
recall
ever
seeing
them
act
this
quickly
hawksworth
had
been
amazed
how
could
mirza
nuruddin
possibly
know
the
terms
he
had
demanded
of
the
governor
produce
a
license
for
trade
within
ten
days
or
the
two
english
frigates
would
weigh
anchor
and
sail
and
accept
english
sovereigns
at
bullion
value
rather
than
the
prevailing
discount
rate
of
percent
required
to
circumvent
minting
time
the
weeks
required
by
the
shahbandar
minters
to
melt
down
foreign
coin
and
it
as
indian
rupees
no
one
could
have
been
more
surprised
than
brian
hawksworth
when
mukarrab
khan
had
immediately
conceded
the
english
terms
and
approved
the
license
valid
for
sixty
days
to
land
goods
and
to
buy
and
sell
why
had
the
governor
agreed
so
readily
overriding
the
dawdling
clerks
naturally
you
need
an
officer
here
to
schedule
the
river
barks
the
shahbandar
voice
was
even
but
hawksworth
thought
he
sensed
an
air
of
tension
suddenly
grip
the
room
normally
barks
are
reserved
weeks
in
advance
now
during
the
high
season
but
we
can
always
accommodate
friends
of
mukarrab
khan
it
was
then
that
hawksworth
had
told
the
shahbandar
he
would
not
be
bringing
cargo
up
the
river
that
instead
it
would
be
transported
overland
from
their
protected
anchorage
using
bullock
carts
arranged
for
by
mukarrab
khan
the
cove
you
call
swalley
is
several
leagues
up
the
coast
captain
foreign
cargo
has
never
before
been
unladed
there
nor
has
it
ever
been
brought
overland
as
you
propose
he
had
seemed
genuinely
disturbed
i
suggest
it
both
irregular
and
unworkable
i
think
you
understand
why
we
have
to
unlade
from
the
cove
the
decision
is
made
hawksworth
tried
to
keep
his
voice
as
firm
as
that
of
mirza
nuruddin
we
unload
the
bullock
carts
just
across
the
river
from
the
port
here
and
we
only
need
a
bark
to
ferry
goods
across
the
harbor
as
you
wish
i
arrange
to
have
one
at
your
disposal
the
shahbandar
drew
pensively
on
the
hookah
ejecting
coils
of
smoke
into
the
already
dense
air
of
the
chamber
and
examined
hawksworth
then
he
continued
i
understand
your
frigates
are
some
five
hundred
tons
each
full
unlading
will
require
at
least
three
weeks
perhaps
four
is
that
a
reasonable
estimate
we
arrange
the
scheduling
why
do
you
ask
merely
for
information
captain
again
the
shahbandar
flashed
his
empty
smile
then
he
bowed
as
lightly
as
protocol
would
admit
and
called
for
a
tray
of
rolled
betel
leaves
signifying
the
meeting
was
ended
as
hawksworth
took
one
he
marveled
that
he
had
so
quickly
acquired
a
taste
for
their
strange
alkaline
sweetness
then
he
looked
again
at
mirza
nuruddin
impassive
eyes
damn
him
does
he
know
what
the
portugals
were
planning
and
was
he
hoping
we
be
caught
unlading
in
the
shallows
at
the
river
mouth
he
knows
i
just
spoiled
their
plans
as
he
had
passed
back
through
the
customs
shed
headed
toward
the
and
sunshine
hawksworth
could
feel
the
hostile
stares
and
he
knew
the
reason
the
new
english
visitors
had
already
made
an
unforgettable
impression
on
the
town
of
surat
the
merchants
george
elkington
and
humphrey
spencer
had
been
given
accommodations
by
a
muslim
whom
spencer
had
immediately
outraged
by
demanding
they
be
served
pork
the
other
men
had
been
temporarily
lodged
in
a
vacant
house
owned
by
an
indigo
broker
after
the
english
seamen
had
disrupted
orderly
proceedings
in
three
separate
brothels
and
been
banned
in
turn
by
each
the
shahbandar
had
ordered
five
girls
sent
to
them
at
the
house
but
with
fewer
women
than
men
a
fight
inevitably
had
ensued
with
thorough
demolition
of
the
plaster
walls
and
shutters
worst
of
all
bosun
mate
john
garway
had
gone
on
a
drunken
spree
in
the
streets
and
in
a
flourish
of
exuberance
severed
the
tail
of
a
bullock
calf
an
animal
sacred
to
the
hindus
with
his
seaman
knife
a
riot
in
the
hindu
quarter
had
erupted
soon
after
forcing
mukarrab
khan
to
remove
the
english
seamen
outside
the
town
walls
in
tents
erected
by
the
tank
the
city
reservoir
yes
hawksworth
sighed
it
be
a
long
time
before
india
forgets
her
first
taste
of
the
english
the
barge
bobbed
lightly
as
two
indian
porters
in
the
mud
hoisted
the
first
roll
of
woolen
cloth
onto
the
planking
this
begins
the
final
leg
of
the
india
voyage
hawksworth
thought
to
himself
and
this
has
been
the
easiest
part
of
all
almost
too
easy
pox
on
it

in
your

that
long
he
reached
into
his
belt
and
drew
out
a
long
portuguese
stiletto
an
elaborate
cross
was
etched
into
the
blade
and
the
handle
was
silver
with
a
ram
head
at
the
butt
the
ram
eyes
were
two
small
rubies
he
had
been
carrying
it
for
two
days
and
he
reflected
again
on
what
had
happened
still
puzzling
he
had
returned
to
the
observatory
the
next
morning
after
he
had
met
shirin
and
this
time
he
brought
his
lute
but
she
did
not
come
that
morning
or
the
morning
after
or
the
morning
after
finally
he
swallowed
his
disappointment
and
concluded
he
would
not
see
her
again
then
it
was
he
had
gone
to
work
cleaning
away
the
moss
and
accumulated
mud
from
the
stone
instruments
parts
of
some
seemed
to
be
missing
and
he
had
searched
the
hut
for
these
without
success
all
he
had
found
was
a
astrolabe
an
instrument
used
to
take
the
altitude
of
the
sun
but
he
also
found
tables
piles
of
handwritten
tables
that
seemed
to
hold
the
key
to
the
use
of
the
instruments
his
hopes
had
soared
it
seemed
possible
just
possible
that
buried
somewhere
in
the
hut
was
the
key
to
the
greatest
mystery
of
all
time
how
to
determine
longitude
at
sea
hawksworth
had
often
pondered
the
difficulties
of
navigation
in
the
deep
ocean
where
only
the
sun
and
stars
were
guides
they
were
the
primary
determent
to
england
new
ambition
to
explore
the
globe
for
english
navigators
were
still
far
less
experienced
than
those
of
the
spanish
and
portuguese
the
problem
seemed
overwhelming
since
the
great
earth
was
curved
no
line
on
its
surface
was
straight
and
once
at
sea
there
was
absolutely
no
way
to
determine
exactly
where
you
were
which
way
you
were
going
or
how
fast
the
least
uncertain
measurement
was
probably
latitude
a
location
north
or
south
of
the
equator
in
the
northern
hemisphere
the
height
of
the
polestar
was
a
reasonably
accurate
determinant
of
latitude
although
it
was
a
full
three
degrees
distant
from
the
northernmost
point
in
the
sky
another
measure
of
latitude
was
the
height
of
the
sun
at
midday
corrected
for
the
specific
day
of
the
year
the
problem
lay
in
how
to
measure
either
of
these
elevations
accurately
a
hundred
years
before
the
portuguese
had
come
across
an
ingenious
arab
device
for
telling
the
elevation
of
the
sun
it
consisted
of
a
board
with
a
knotted
length
of
string
run
through
the
middle
if
a
mariner
held
the
board
vertically
and
sighted
the
horizon
at
one
end
and
some
object
in
the
sky
at
the
other
the
length
of
the
string
between
the
board
and
his
eye
could
be
used
to
calculate
the
elevation
of
the
object
in
a
short
time
a
version
appeared
in
europe
with
a
second
board
replacing
the
string
called
the
however
since
locating
both
the
horizon
and
a
star
was
almost
impossible
at
any
time
except
dawn
or
dusk
this
device
worked
best
for
sighting
the
sun
save
that
it
required
staring
into
the
disc
of
the
sun
to
find
its
exact
center
also
the
could
not
be
used
when
the
sun
was
high
in
the
sky
which
was
the
case
in
equatorial
waters
another
version
of
the
was
the
astrolabe
a
round
brass
dial
etched
with
degree
markings
and
provided
with
a
movable
sight
that
permitted
taking
the
elevation
of
the
sun
by
its
shadow
but
even
with
the
astrolabe
there
was
the
problem
of
catching
the
sun
precisely
at
midday
and
on
a
rolling
ship
the
error
in
reading
it
could
easily
be
four
degrees
for
longitude
a
ship
location
east
or
west
on
the
globe
there
were
no
fixed
references
at
all
but
as
a
mariner
traveled
east
or
west
the
sun
would
come
up
somewhat
earlier
or
later
each
day
and
precisely
how
much
earlier
or
later
could
be
used
to
compute
how
far
he
had
gone
therefore
calculating
longitude
depended
solely
on
keeping
time
extremely
accurately
something
completely
impossible
the
best
timekeeping
device
available
was
the
hourglass
or
sandglass
invented
somewhere
in
the
western
mediterranean
in
the
eleventh
or
twelfth
century
sandglass
makers
never
achieved
real
accuracy
or
consistency
and
careful
mariners
always
used
several
at
once
hoping
to
average
out
variations
but
on
a
long
voyage
seamen
soon
totally
lost
track
of
absolute
time
since
they
were
unable
to
determine
a
ship
location
from
the
skies
mariners
also
tried
to
compute
it
from
a
vessel
speed
and
direction
speed
was
estimated
by
throwing
a
log
with
a
knotted
rope
attached
overboard
and
timing
the
rate
at
which
the
knots
in
the
rope
played
out
using
a
sandglass
margins
of
error
in
computing
speed
were
usually
substantial
direction
too
was
never
known
completely
accurately
a
compass
pointed
to
magnetic
north
not
true
north
and
the
difference
between
these
seemed
to
vary
unaccountably
at
different
locations
on
the
globe
some
thought
it
had
to
do
with
the
lodestone
used
to
magnetize
the
needle
and
others
like
the
grand
pilot
of
the
king
of
spain
maintained
seamen
were
merely
lying
to
cover
their
own
errors
for
it
all
however
longitude
was
the
most
vital
unknown
many
attempts
had
been
made
to
find
a
way
to
fix
longitude
but
nothing
ever
worked
seamen
found
the
only
real
solution
to
the
problem
was
latitude
sailing
a
and
expensive
procedure
whereby
a
captain
would
sail
north
or
south
to
the
approximate
latitude
of
his
destination
and
then
sail
due
east
or
west
rather
than
trying
to
sail
on
the
diagonal
king
philip
iii
of
spain
had
offered
a
fortune
to
the
first
man
who
discovered
how
to
tell
longitude
at
sea
hawksworth
spent
days
poring
through
the
piles
of
tables
many
of
which
were
strewn
about
the
floor
of
the
room
and
damaged
from
mildew
and
rot
next
he
carefully
copied
the
symbols
off
the
walls
of
the
circular
building
and
matched
these
with
those
on
several
of
the
charts
were
these
the
names
of
the
major
stars
or
constellations
of
the
zodiac
or
what
the
number
was
and
then
it
came
to
him
they
were
the
daily
stations
of
the
moon
as
he
continued
to
sift
through
the
documents
he
realized
that
the
scholar
who
wrote
them
had
predicted
eclipses
of
the
moon
for
many
years
in
advance
then
he
found
a
book
obviously
old
with
charts
that
seemed
to
provide
geometric
corrections
for
the
distortion
caused
by
the
atmosphere
when
sighting
stars
near
the
horizon
something
that
always
had
been
troublesome
for
navigators
he
also
found
other
writings
new
some
appeared
to
be
verses
and
others
tables
of
names
and
numbers
sums
of
money
were
written
next
to
some
of
the
names
but
none
of
it
meant
anything
without
the
persian
which
he
could
not
read
and
shirin
had
never
returned
to
the
observatory
at
least
not
when
he
was
there
until
two
days
ago
at
the
observatory
that
morning
the
sky
had
been
a
perfect
ice
blue
the
garden
and
orchard
still
the
air
dry
and
exhilarating
no
workmen
were
splashing
in
the
moat
beyond
the
wall
that
day
only
the
buzz
of
gnats
intruded
on
the
silence
he
had
brought
a
bottle
of
dry
persian
wine
to
make
the
work
go
faster
finding
he
was
growing
accustomed
to
its
taste
and
he
had
brought
his
lute
as
always
in
hope
shirin
would
come
again
he
was
in
the
stone
hut
cleaning
and
sorting
pages
of
manuscript
when
she
appeared
silently
in
the
doorway
he
looked
up
and
felt
a
sudden
rush
in
his
chest
have
you
uncovered
all
of
jamshid
beg
secrets
her
voice
was
lilting
but
with
a
trace
of
unease
i
found
out
that
was
our
famous
astronomer
name
he
was
originally
from
samarkand
i
think
i
beginning
to
understand
some
of
the
tables
hawksworth
kept
his
tone
he
should
have
been
a
navigator
he
could
have
been
a
fellow
at
trinity
house
what
is
that
it
a
guild
in
england
where
navigators
are
trained
she
laughed
i
think
he
preferred
a
world
made
only
of
numbers
her
laugh
was
gone
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
and
she
moved
toward
him
with
a
vaguely
troubled
look
what
have
you
found
a
lot
of
things
take
a
look
at
this
drawing
hawksworth
tried
to
remain
nonchalant
as
he
moved
the
lamp
back
to
the
table
from
where
he
had
placed
it
on
the
floor
he
identified
what
we
call
parallax
the
slight
circular
motion
of
the
moon
throughout
the
day
caused
by
the
fact
it
not
sighted
from
the
center
of
the
earth
but
from
a
spot
on
its
surface
that
moves
as
the
earth
rotates
now
if
he
could
measure
that
accurately
enough
with
these
instruments
shirin
waved
her
hand
and
laughed
again
if
you
understand
all
this
why
not
just
take
the
papers
back
to
the
palace
and
work
with
them
there
she
was
in
the
room
now
her
olive
cheeks
exquisitely
shadowed
by
the
partially
open
door
where
flickering
shadows
played
lightly
through
the
brilliant
sunshine
today
rather
hear
you
play
your
english
instrument
with
pleasure
i
been
trying
to
learn
an
indian
raga
he
kept
his
voice
even
and
moved
himself
deftly
between
shirin
and
the
doorway
blocking
her
exit
but
it
sounds
wrong
on
the
lute
when
i
get
to
agra
i
thinking
i
have
a
sitar
made
he
reached
as
though
for
the
lute
then
swung
his
hand
upward
and
clapped
it
over
shirin
mouth
before
she
could
move
he
shoved
her
against
the
wall
beside
the
door
and
stretched
with
his
other
hand
to
seize
the
heavy
brass
astrolabe
that
rested
on
a
stand
by
the
table
he
caught
a
look
of
pure
terror
in
her
eyes
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
she
might
scream
he
pressed
her
harder
against
the
wall
to
seal
her
mouth
and
as
the
shaft
of
light
from
the
doorway
dimmed
momentarily
he
stepped
forward
and
swung
the
brass
astrolabe
upward
there
was
a
soft
sound
of
impact
followed
by
a
choked
groan
and
the
clatter
of
metal
against
the
wooden
door
he
drew
back
the
astrolabe
now
with
a
trace
of
blood
along
its
sharp
edge
and
the
remains
of
a
tooth
wedged
between
its
discs
then
he
looked
out
to
see
a
skinned
indian
man
in
a
loincloth
rolling
himself
across
the
top
of
the
garden
wall
a
faint
splash
followed
as
he
dropped
into
the
moat
when
hawksworth
released
shirin
and
placed
the
astrolabe
back
on
its
stand
he
caught
the
glint
of
sunshine
off
a
stiletto
lying
in
the
doorway
he
bent
down
to
retrieve
it
and
suddenly
she
was
next
to
him
holding
his
arm
and
staring
at
the
place
where
the
man
had
scaled
the
wall
he
was
a
sudra
a
low
caste
she
looked
at
the
stiletto
in
hawksworth
hand
and
her
voice
turned
to
scorn
it
portuguese
only
the
portuguese
would
hire
someone
like
that
instead
of
a
rajput
then
she
laughed
nervously
if
they
hired
a
rajput
someone
would
be
dead
now
hire
a
sudra
and
you
get
a
sudra
work
who
was
it
who
knows
the
horse
bazaar
is
full
of
men
who
would
kill
for
ten
rupees
she
pointed
toward
the
wall
do
you
see
that
piece
of
cloth
there
on
the
old
spike
i
think
it
a
piece
of
his
would
you
get
it
for
me
after
hawksworth
had
retrieved
the
shred
of
cotton
loincloth
brown
from
a
hundred
washings
in
the
river
she
had
taken
it
from
him
without
a
word
what
will
you
do
with
it
do
she
touched
a
finger
to
his
lips
these
are
things
it
best
not
to
ask
then
she
tucked
the
brown
scrap
into
the
silken
sash
at
her
waist
and
moved
toward
the
door
and
it
would
be
better
if
you
forgot
about
today
hawksworth
watched
her
for
a
second
then
seized
her
arm
and
turned
her
facing
him
i
may
not
know
what
going
on
but
by
jesus
i
know
before
you
leave
and
you
can
start
by
telling
me
why
you
come
here
she
stared
back
at
him
for
a
moment
meeting
his
eyes
there
was
something
in
them
he
had
never
seen
before
almost
admiration
then
she
caught
herself
and
drew
back
dropping
into
a
chair
very
well
perhaps
you
do
deserve
to
know
she
slipped
the
translucent
scarf
from
her
hair
and
tossed
it
across
the
table
why
do
you
open
the
wine
you
brought
i
not
tell
you
everything
because
you
should
want
me
to
but
i
tell
you
what
important
for
you
hawksworth
remembered
how
he
had
slowly
poured
the
wine
for
her
his
hand
still
trembling
have
you
ever
heard
of
samad
she
had
begun
taking
a
small
sip
i
think
he
the
poet
mukarrab
khan
quoted
once
he
called
him
a
sufi
rascal
is
that
what
he
said
good
that
only
confirms
once
again
what
i
think
of
his
excellency
she
laughed
with
contempt
samad
is
a
great
poet
he
perhaps
the
last
great
persian
writer
in
the
tradition
of
omar
khayyam
he
has
favored
me
by
allowing
me
to
be
one
of
his
disciples
so
you
come
here
to
write
poems
when
i
feel
something
i
want
to
say
but
i
also
found
lists
of
names
here
and
numbers
i
told
you
i
ca
tell
you
everything
shirin
look
darkened
momentarily
as
she
drank
again
lightly
from
the
cup
then
settled
it
on
the
table
he
found
himself
watching
her
face
drawn
to
her
by
something
he
could
not
fully
understand
but
i
can
tell
you
this
there
someone
in
india
who
will
one
day
rid
us
of
the
infidel
portuguese
do
you
know
of
prince
jadar
he
the
son
of
the
moghul
i
guessing
he
probably
succeed
one
day
he
should
if
he
not
betrayed
things
are
very
unsettled
in
agra
he
has
many
enemies
there
she
paused
he
has
enemies
here
i
not
sure
i
understand
then
you
should
because
what
happens
in
agra
will
affect
everyone
even
you
but
what
does
agra
politics
have
to
do
with
me
the
knife
was
portuguese
to
understand
what
happening
you
should
first
know
about
akman
the
one
we
remember
now
as
the
great
moghul
he
was
the
father
of
arangbar
the
moghul
now
i
was
only
a
small
girl
when
akman
died
but
i
still
remember
my
sadness
my
feeling
the
universe
would
collapse
we
worshiped
him
almost
it
not
talked
about
now
but
the
truth
is
akman
did
really
want
arangbar
to
succeed
him
nobody
did
but
he
had
no
choice
in
fact
when
akman
died
arangbar
eldest
son
started
a
rebellion
to
deny
him
the
throne
but
that
son
troops
betrayed
him
and
after
they
surrendered
arangbar
blinded
him
in
punishment
khusrav
his
own
son
although
prince
jadar
was
still
only
a
young
boy
then
we
all
thought
after
that
he
would
be
moghul
himself
one
day
but
that
was
before
the
persians
came
to
power
in
agra
but
are
you
persian
yourself
i
was
born
in
india
but
yes
i
have
the
great
fortune
to
be
of
persian
blood
there
are
many
persians
in
india
you
know
persians
still
intimidate
the
moghuls
ours
is
a
magnificent
culture
an
ancient
culture
and
persians
never
let
the
moghuls
forget
it
shirin
had
dabbed
at
her
brow
and
rose
to
peer
out
the
door
of
the
observatory
building
as
though
by
instinct
did
you
know
that
the
first
moghul
came
to
india
less
than
a
hundred
years
ago
actually
after
the
portuguese
he
was
named
babur
a
distant
descendant
of
the
mongol
warrior
genghis
khan
and
he
was
from
central
asia
babur
was
the
grandfather
of
akman
they
say
he
had
wanted
to
invade
persia
but
that
the
ruling
dynasty
the
safavis
was
too
strong
so
he
invaded
india
instead
and
the
moghuls
have
been
trying
to
make
it
into
persia
ever
since
that
why
persians
can
always
find
work
in
india
they
teach
their
language
at
court
and
give
lessons
in
fashion
and
in
painting
and
garden
design
samad
came
here
from
persia
and
now
he
the
national
poet
what
do
these
persians
have
to
do
with
whatever
happening
in
agra
are
you
or
your
family
somehow
involved
too
my
father
was
shayhk
mirak
she
hesitated
a
moment
as
though
expecting
a
response
then
she
continued
evenly
of
course
you
not
know
of
him
he
was
a
court
painter
he
came
to
india
when
akman
was
moghul
and
took
a
position
under
the
persian
mir
sayyid
ali
who
directed
the
painting
studio
akman
founded
you
know
i
always
found
it
amusing
that
akman
had
to
use
persian
artists
to
create
the
moghul
school
of
indian
painting
anyway
my
father
was
very
skilled
at
moghul
portraits
which
everybody
now
says
were
invented
by
akman
and
when
akman
died
arangbar
named
my
father
to
head
the
school
it
lasted
until
she
was
brought
to
agra
who
the
queen
the
one
called
janahara
but
why
was
your
father
sent
away
because
i
was
sent
away
hawksworth
thought
he
sensed
a
kind
of
nervous
intensity
quivering
behind
shirin
voice
it
your
story
he
told
himself
that
really
like
to
hear
but
he
said
nothing
and
the
silence
swelled
finally
she
spoke
again
to
understand
the
trouble
now
you
must
understand
about
the
queen
her
story
is
almost
amazing
and
already
legends
are
growing
around
her
it
said
she
was
born
the
day
her
father
zainul
beg
left
persia
as
an
adventurer
bound
for
india
he
ordered
her
abandoned
in
the
sun
to
die
but
after
the
caravan
traveled
on
his
wife
lamented
for
the
baby
so
much
he
decided
to
return
for
her
although
the
sun
was
intense
they
found
her
still
alive
it
said
a
cobra
was
shading
her
with
his
hood
shirin
turned
to
hawksworth
her
dark
eyes
seeming
to
snap
can
you
believe
such
a
story
no
it
sounds
like
a
fable
neither
can
i
but
half
the
people
in
india
do
her
father
finally
reached
lahore
the
city
in
india
where
akman
was
staying
and
managed
to
enter
his
service
like
any
persian
he
did
very
well
and
before
long
akman
gave
him
a
of
three
hundred
his
wife
and
daughter
were
allowed
to
come
and
go
among
the
palace
women
then
when
she
was
seventeen
this
little
persian
girl
of
the
cobra
began
her
plan
she
repeatedly
threw
herself
across
the
path
of
the
moghul
son
arangbar
whom
she
rightly
guessed
would
be
next
in
line
for
the
throne
he
was
no
match
for
her
and
now
people
say
she
won
his
heart
before
he
knew
it
himself
my
own
belief
is
she
cast
a
spell
on
him
and
he
married
her
of
course
not
akman
was
no
fool
he
knew
she
was
a
schemer
and
when
he
saw
what
she
was
doing
he
immediately
had
her
married
to
a
persian
general
named
sher
afgan
whom
he
then
appointed
governor
of
bengal
a
province
in
the
distant
east
of
india
akman
died
a
few
years
after
that
still
thinking
he
had
saved
arangbar
from
her
but
he
counted
on
the
spell
so
how
did
she
get
back
to
agra
and
become
queen
that
part
i
know
very
well
shirin
laughed
bitterly
i
was
there
you
see
arangbar
never
forgot
his
persian
cobra
girl
even
after
he
became
moghul
himself
and
he
found
a
way
to
get
her
back
one
day
he
announced
he
was
receiving
reports
of
unrest
in
bengal
where
sher
afgan
was
still
governor
and
he
summoned
the
governor
to
agra
to
explain
when
no
answer
came
he
sent
troops
nobody
knows
what
happened
but
the
story
was
given
out
that
sher
afgan
drew
a
sword
on
arangbar
men
perhaps
he
did
they
say
he
was
impulsive
but
the
imperial
troops
cut
him
down
then
arangbar
ordered
sher
persian
wife
and
her
little
daughter
layla
back
to
agra
and
put
them
under
the
protection
of
his
mother
the
dowager
queen
then
just
as
we
all
predicted
he
married
her
at
first
he
was
going
to
put
her
in
the
the
harem
but
she
refused
she
demanded
to
be
made
his
queen
an
equal
and
that
what
he
did
except
now
she
actually
more
she
the
real
ruler
of
india
and
you
were
in
the
harem
the
then
hawksworth
decided
to
gamble
on
the
story
he
had
heard
shirin
stared
at
him
trying
to
hide
what
seemed
to
be
surprise
you
know
for
a
moment
he
thought
she
might
reach
out
and
touch
his
hand
but
then
she
drew
back
into
herself
yes
i
was
still
in
the
then
but
not
for
long
the
first
thing
janahara
did
was
find
out
which
women
arangbar
favored
and
she
then
had
us
all
married
off
to
governors
of
provinces
far
from
agra
you
know
a
muslim
man
is
allowed
four
wives
so
there
always
room
for
one
more
mukarrab
khan
got
me
she
seems
very
clever
you
have
heard
even
half
her
story
yet
next
she
arranged
to
have
her
brother
nadir
sharif
appointed
prime
minister
and
her
father
zainul
beg
made
chief
adviser
to
arangbar
so
now
she
and
her
family
control
the
moghul
and
everyone
around
him
shirin
paused
not
quite
everyone
yet
not
prince
jadar
but
he
be
the
next
moghul
when
that
happens
what
becomes
of
her
he
the
next
moghul
and
if
he
is
her
power
will
be
gone
that
why
she
wants
to
destroy
him
now
but
how
can
she
if
he
the
rightful
heir
hawksworth
found
himself
suddenly
dismayed
by
the
specter
of
agra
in
turmoil
no
one
knows
but
she
think
of
a
way
and
then
she
find
someone
she
can
control
to
be
the
next
moghul
why
do
you
care
so
much
who
succeeds
arangbar
one
reason
i
care
is
because
of
samad
her
eyes
suddenly
saddened
now
i
really
do
understand
he
a
poet
why
should
it
matter
to
him
because
the
queen
would
like
to
see
him
dead
he
has
too
much
influence
you
must
understand
that
the
queen
and
her
family
are
a
persian
sect
of
islam
they
believe
all
men
should
bow
to
some
dogmatic
mullah
whom
they
call
an
but
this
was
never
in
the
teachings
given
to
the
prophet
a
curse
on
all
religions
hawksworth
had
thought
am
i
caught
in
the
middle
of
some
muslim
holy
war
but
why
do
these
persians
or
their
want
to
be
rid
of
samad
because
he
a
sufi
a
mystic
who
teaches
that
we
all
should
find
god
within
our
own
selves
without
the
mullahs
that
why
the
persian
despise
him
and
want
him
dead
then
he
supporting
prince
jadar
samad
does
not
concern
himself
with
politics
but
it
the
duty
of
the
others
of
us
those
who
understand
what
is
happening
to
help
prince
jadar
because
we
know
he
will
stop
the
persians
and
their
who
are
now
spreading
their
poison
of
hate
in
india
and
he
also
rid
india
of
the
portuguese
i
sure
of
it
she
paused
for
a
moment
you
know
it
always
seemed
ironic
that
the
persians
and
the
portuguese
should
actually
work
together
but
in
a
way
each
needs
the
other
the
portuguese
have
made
the
persians
particularly
the
queen
and
her
brother
nadir
sharif
very
rich
and
in
return
they
allowed
to
send
their
jesuits
to
preach
so
both
the
persians
and
the
portuguese
want
to
prevent
prince
jadar
from
becoming
the
next
moghul
since
they
know
he
like
nothing
better
than
to
rid
india
of
them
both
but
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
me
i
just
want
a
trading
from
arangbar
he
still
alive
and
healthy
and
he
should
know
the
portugals
ca
stop
english
trading
ships
from
coming
here
why
should
he
give
us
a
ca
you
see
the
english
can
never
be
allowed
to
trade
here
it
would
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
the
portuguese
it
would
show
all
the
world
they
no
longer
can
control
india
ports
but
what
i
really
trying
to
make
you
see
is
that
it
not
only
the
portuguese
who
want
to
stop
you
it
also
the
people
who
support
them
so
no
one
can
aid
you
openly
the
persians
are
already
too
powerful
still
there
are
those
here
who
would
protect
you
who
do
you
mean
how
could
i
possibly
tell
you
she
held
him
with
her
eyes
i
scarcely
know
you
but
you
should
listen
to
your
intuition
samad
says
we
all
have
an
inner
voice
that
tells
us
what
is
true
this
time
she
did
reach
and
touch
his
hand
and
her
touch
was
strangely
warm
in
the
chill
of
the
room
i
ca
tell
you
any
more
really
so
now
will
you
play
for
me
something
tender
perhaps
a
song
you
would
play
for
the
woman
you
left
behind
you
in
england
i
did
have
all
that
much
to
leave
behind
he
picked
up
the
lute
but
i
be
happy
to
play
for
you
you
have
no
one
there
was
a
woman
in
london
but
she
married
while
i
was
gone
she
would
wait
while
you
were
away
shirin
sipped
again
from
her
cup
and
her
eyes
darkened
that
must
have
been
very
sad
for
you
it
could
be
she
did
think
i
was
worth
waiting
for
he
hesitated
i
had
some
time
to
think
about
it
since
in
a
way
it
was
probably
my
own
fault
i
think
she
wanted
more
than
i
was
ready
to
give
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
perhaps
what
she
wanted
was
you
and
you
would
give
yourself
tell
me
what
she
was
like
what
was
she
like
he
looked
away
remembering
maggie
face
with
a
strange
mixture
of
longing
and
bitterness
well
she
like
nobody
i
seen
in
india
red
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
salty
tongue
he
laughed
if
she
was
ever
anybody
fourth
wife
i
pity
the
other
three
he
felt
his
laugh
fade
i
missed
her
a
lot
when
i
was
away
before
but
now
he
tried
to
shrug
she
looked
at
him
as
though
she
understood
it
all
then
if
you
play
for
her
any
more
will
you
play
just
for
me
one
of
your
english
ragas
what
if
i
played
a
suite
by
dowland
one
of
our
english
composers
it
one
of
my
favorites
he
found
himself
smiling
again
the
lute
comfortable
and
reassuring
in
his
grasp
i
hope
you
wo
think
it
sounds
too
out
of
place
we
both
out
of
place
here
now
she
returned
his
smile
wistfully
and
glanced
at
the
papers
on
the
desk
you
and
me
hawksworth
saw
george
elkington
approaching
and
dropped
the
dagger
quickly
into
his
boot
take
a
lifetime
the
rate
these
heathens
dawdle
elkington
wiped
a
sweaty
arm
across
his
brow
deep
bags
sagged
under
his
bloodshot
eyes
an
we
be
months
movin
the
lead
and
ironwork
with
these
damn
rickety
carts
not
to
mention
the
silver
bullion
for
buyin
commodity
we
have
to
get
a
barge
how
many
more
trips
do
you
need
to
bring
in
the
wool
ca
say
but
is
clear
we
need
more
of
these
damn
carts
for
what
little
they
worth
as
elkington
turned
to
spit
he
spotted
a
porter
who
had
let
a
roll
of
woolen
cloth
dip
into
the
river
and
his
neck
veins
pulsed
hey
you
heathen
bastard
mind
the
water
he
stumbled
after
the
terrified
man
trailing
a
stream
of
oaths
hawksworth
leaned
against
the
wooden
spokes
of
a
bullock
cart
and
quickly
passed
the
stiletto
from
his
boot
back
to
his
belt
as
he
watched
the
bark
tipped
beginning
to
list
dangerously
and
then
he
heard
elkington
command
the
porters
to
stop
the
loading
and
prepare
to
get
underway
only
five
of
the
bullock
carts
had
been
emptied
and
the
sun
was
already
approaching
midafternoon
as
hawksworth
had
watched
the
men
at
work
some
corner
of
his
mind
had
become
dimly
aware
of
a
curious
anomaly
whereas
the
porters
were
working
at
full
speed
the
drivers
of
the
bullock
carts
seemed
actually
to
be
hindering
the
unloading
moving
the
carts
around
in
a
confused
way
that
always
kept
the
work
disorganized
and
a
number
of
answers
began
just
began
to
fall
into
place
hawksworth
do
you
expect
to
be
joinin
us
george
elkington
stalked
up
and
began
to
scrape
his
muddy
boots
on
the
spokes
of
the
bullock
cart
elkington
i
want
you
to
dismiss
these
drivers
hawksworth
ignored
his
sarcastic
tone
i
want
the
shahbandar
to
supply
all
our
men
from
now
on
what
the
bloody
hell
for
elkington
tightened
his
hat
and
hitched
up
his
belt
something
wrong
did
you
have
any
accidents
coming
in
from
swalley
accidents
nay
not
a
bleedin
one
unless
you
call
the
axle
of
a
cart
breakin
the
first
day
and
blockin
a
narrow
turn
in
the
road
with
mud
on
both
sides
so
we
could
pass
and
had
to
unload
the
whole
bleedin
lot
and
look
half
the
mornin
for
another
cart
to
hire
then
the
drivers
had
a
fight
over
who
was
responsible
and
who
pay
for
what
and
we
could
start
till
after
midday
and
yesterday
one
of
their
damn
bullocks
died
right
in
the
road
which
is
scarce
wonder
considerin
how
worn
out
they
are
nay
we
had
no
accidents
the
whole
bleedin
trip
was
an
accident
then
let
get
rid
of
them
all
men
carts
bullocks
the
lot
and
hire
new
let
the
shahbandar
hire
them
for
us
we
pay
in
silver
and
give
him
his
commission
and
i
sure
he
provide
us
what
we
need
think
he
can
do
any
better
elkington
skeptical
eyes
squinted
against
the
sun
these
damn
heathens
all
appear
similar
i
think
he
make
a
difference
they
all
seem
terrified
of
him
we
have
to
try
hawksworth
started
for
the
barge
you
do
have
much
time
left
shirin
had
said
try
to
understand
what
happening
the
porters
were
loosening
the
lines
on
the
pegs
the
bark
was
ready
to
get
underway
do
assume
you
know
who
aid
you
she
had
said
help
may
come
in
a
way
that
surprises
you
it
ca
be
known
who
helping
you
he
waded
through
the
mud
and
pulled
himself
onto
the
bark
then
he
turned
and
rolled
over
onto
a
bale
of
cloth
the
sky
was
flawless
and
empty
just
trust
what
feels
right
she
had
said
and
for
no
reason
at
all
she
had
reached
out
and
touched
his
lute
learn
to
trust
your
senses
most
of
all
she
had
taken
his
hand
and
held
it
longer
than
she
should
have
learn
to
open
yourself
they
were
underway
the
shahbandar
watched
from
the
as
the
bark
of
english
woolens
moved
in
short
spurts
toward
the
steps
below
him
oars
sparkled
in
the
sunshine
and
the
faint
chant
of
the
rowers
bounced
garbled
across
the
waves
behind
him
two
short
men
held
the
large
umbrella
that
shaded
his
face
and
rotund
belly
a
circle
of
guards
with
poles
pushed
away
traders
who
shouted
begs
and
bribes
for
a
moment
of
his
time
injtheir
tent
to
inspect
their
goods
please
and
render
them
salable
commodity
with
his
chapp
and
an
invoice
stating
their
worth
preferably
undervalued
the
percent
duty
was
prescribed
by
the
moghul
the
assessed
value
was
not
mirza
nuruddin
ignored
them
he
was
calculating
time
not
rupees
his
latest
report
was
that
four
weeks
more
were
needed
for
the
viceroy
to
outfit
the
galleons
and
fireships
but
the
frigatta
bringing
the
news
from
goa
was
two
weeks
in
travel
which
means
the
galleons
will
be
here
within
three
perhaps
two
weeks
he
told
himself
a
portuguese
armada
of
twelve
warships
the
englishman
luck
has
run
out
they
be
caught
unlading
and
burned
he
fingered
the
shred
of
dirty
cloth
tucked
in
his
waist
it
had
been
sent
by
shirin
wrapped
with
a
gift
of
aga
of
the
rose
her
cryptic
note
had
told
him
all
he
had
needed
to
know
when
his
spies
reported
no
one
recently
injured
among
the
servants
of
the
portuguese
jesuits
the
search
had
begun
in
the
horse
bazaar
they
had
found
the
man
the
next
day
the
truth
had
come
quickly
when
mirza
nuruddin
name
was
mentioned
and
nothing
had
been
learned
the
man
had
been
given
the
knife
by
servants
their
master
name
was
never
divulged
but
they
knew
well
the
routine
of
the
englishman
and
the
location
of
the
observatory
and
now
i
must
tamper
with
your
destiny
english
captain
we
are
all
you
i
the
prince
captives
of
a
world
we
no
longer
can
fully
control
he
asked
himself
again
why
he
had
made
the
choice
finally
to
take
the
risks
jadar
had
asked
when
the
odds
against
the
prince
were
growing
daily
it
was
stupid
to
support
him
now
and
mirza
nuruddin
had
always
held
absolute
contempt
for
stupidity
particularly
when
it
meant
supporting
a
hopeless
cause
if
the
queen
crushes
him
as
she
very
likely
will
i
jeopardized
my
position
my
holdings
probably
my
life
the
prince
does
not
understand
how
difficult
my
task
is
the
infidel
englishman
is
almost
too
clever
i
had
planned
it
perfectly
i
had
shown
them
the
opportunity
for
great
profit
then
denied
it
to
them
they
were
preparing
to
leave
but
surely
they
would
have
returned
with
a
fleet
then
mukarrab
khan
approved
their
trade
after
waiting
until
he
was
certain
the
portuguese
preparations
were
almost
complete
so
now
they
remain
awaiting
their
own
destruction
never
to
leave
again
and
when
these
frigates
are
destroyed
will
any
english
ever
return
the
englishman
will
surely
be
dead
or
sent
to
goa
there
be
no
trip
to
agra
and
arangbar
will
never
know
why
but
the
silver
coin
will
soon
be
ready
and
the
prince
cipher
today
said
vasant
rao
himself
will
arrive
in
ten
days
to
escort
the
englishman
and
the
silver
as
far
as
burhanpur
time
is
running
out
there
only
one
solution
left
will
it
work
the
barge
eased
into
the
shallows
and
the
porters
slid
into
the
water
each
already
carrying
a
roll
of
cloth
i
expected
this
difficulty
captain
hawksworth
but
your
path
is
of
your
own
making
you
yourself
chose
to
unlade
at
that
distance
from
the
port
they
were
in
mirza
nuruddin
chamber
and
the
shahbandar
faced
hawksworth
and
elkington
with
his
rheumy
fogbound
eyes
the
chamber
had
been
emptied
as
hawksworth
had
demanded
i
propose
you
consider
the
following
unlade
the
woolens
from
your
smaller
frigate
immediately
and
let
me
oversee
their
transport
here
he
drew
nonchalantly
on
the
hookah
my
fee
would
be
a
small
commission
above
the
cost
of
hiring
the
carts
one
percent
if
they
are
delivered
here
within
two
weeks
two
percent
if
they
are
delivered
within
one
week
do
you
accept
hawksworth
decided
not
to
translate
the
terms
for
elkington
we
accept
it
seems
fair
he
told
himself
this
is
no
time
to
bargain
you
show
yourself
reasonable
now
the
lead
and
ironwork
you
have
cargoed
is
another
matter
bullock
carts
are
totally
unsuitable
for
those
weights
in
this
sandy
coastal
delta
the
weights
involved
require
they
be
transported
by
river
bark
and
that
means
unlading
at
the
river
mouth
hawksworth
shook
his
head
we
dump
the
cargo
first
we
ca
take
the
risk
now
captain
there
is
risk
and
there
is
risk
what
is
life
itself
if
not
risk
without
risk
what
man
can
call
himself
alive
mirza
nuruddin
thought
of
his
own
risk
at
this
moment
how
his
offer
of
help
to
the
english
would
immediately
be
misconstrued
by
the
entire
port
until
the
plan
had
played
through
to
its
ending
then
the
thought
of
the
ending
buoyed
him
and
he
continued
his
voice
full
of
solicitude
i
can
suggest
a
strategy
for
unlading
your
ironwork
at
the
river
mouth
in
reasonable
safety
after
your
frigates
have
been
lightened
of
their
wool
with
an
experienced
pilot
you
can
sail
along
the
shoreline
south
to
the
bar
and
anchor
under
cover
of
dark
barks
can
be
waiting
to
unlade
you
if
the
lead
and
ironwork
are
ready
for
unlading
perhaps
it
can
be
completed
in
one
night
you
can
unlade
the
smaller
frigate
first
return
it
to
the
cove
you
call
swalley
and
then
unlade
the
other
vessel
that
way
only
one
frigate
is
exposed
at
a
time
as
hawksworth
and
elkington
listened
mirza
nuruddin
outlined
the
details
of
his
offer
he
would
hire
whatever
men
were
needed
he
normally
did
this
for
foreign
traders
and
took
a
percentage
from
them
as
well
as
from
the
meager
salary
of
the
men
he
hired
and
he
already
had
a
pilot
in
mind
a
man
who
knew
every
shoal
and
sandbar
on
the
coastline
as
hawksworth
listened
his
senses
suddenly
told
him
to
beware
shirin
told
him
to
trust
his
intuition
and
this
scheme
was
too
pat
this
time
his
guts
told
him
to
dump
the
lead
in
the
bay
and
write
off
the
loss
but
elkington
would
never
agree
he
would
want
to
believe
they
could
unlade
and
sell
the
lead
his
responsibility
was
profit
on
the
cargo
not
the
risk
of
a
vessel
so
he
would
take
this
final
risk
perhaps
mirza
nuruddin
was
right
risk
exhilarated
he
smiled
inwardly
and
thought
again
of
shirin
and
of
what
she
had
said
about
trusting
his
instincts
then
ignoring
them
he
agreed
to
mirza
nuruddin
plan
and
the
shahbandar
produced
a
document
already
prepared
for
their
signature
chapter
eleven
now
we
will
begin
as
my
guest
you
have
first
throw
of
the
dice
mirza
nuruddin
fingered
the
gold
and
ivory
inlay
of
the
wooden
dice
cup
as
he
passed
it
to
hawksworth
then
he
drew
a
heavy
gurgle
of
smoke
from
his
hookah
savoring
the
way
it
raced
his
heart
for
that
brief
instant
before
its
marvelous
calm
washed
over
his
nerves
he
needed
the
calm
he
knew
that
any
plan
even
one
as
carefully
conceived
as
the
one
tonight
could
fail
through
the
blundering
of
incompetents
or
betrayal
but
tonight
he
told
himself
tonight
you
will
win
the
game
the
inner
court
of
the
shahbandar
sprawling
brick
estate
house
was
crowded
almost
to
overflowing
with
wealthy
hindu
lenders
whose
mercenary
hearts
were
as
black
as
their
robes
were
white
muslim
port
officials
in
silks
and
jewels
private
riches
gleaned
at
public
expense
the
turbaned
captains
of
arab
cargo
ships
anchored
at
the
bar
hard
men
in
varicolored
robes
who
sat
sweltering
smoking
and
drinking
steaming
coffee
and
a
sprinkling
of
portuguese
in
starched
doublets
the
captains
and
officers
of
the
three
portuguese
trading
frigatta
now
anchored
at
the
bar
downriver
servants
wearing
only
white
loincloths
circulated
decanters
of
wine
and
boxes
of
rolled
betel
leaves
as
an
antidote
to
the
stifling
air
that
lingered
even
now
almost
at
midnight
from
a
broiling
day
the
torchbearers
of
mirza
nuruddin
household
stood
on
the
balconies
continuously
dousing
a
mixture
of
coconut
oil
and
rose
attar
onto
their
huge
flambeaux
behind
latticework
screens
the
girls
waited
in
boredom
braiding
their
hair
smoothing
their
skintight
trousers
inspecting
themselves
in
the
on
their
right
thumb
and
chewing
betel
the
dancing
would
not
begin
until
well
after
midnight
as
hawksworth
took
the
dice
cup
the
sweating
crowd
fell
expectantly
silent
and
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
the
gentle
splash
of
the
river
below
them
through
the
trees
he
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
lined
board
lying
on
the
carpet
between
them
then
he
wished
himself
luck
and
tossed
the
three
dice
along
its
side
they
were
ivory
and
rectangular
their
four
long
sides
numbered
one
two
five
and
six
with
inlaid
teakwood
dots
he
had
thrown
a
one
and
two
sixes
a
propitious
start
you
english
embrace
fortune
as
a
brahmin
his
birthright
the
shahbandar
turned
and
smiled
toward
the
portuguese
captains
loitering
behind
him
who
watched
mutely
scarcely
masking
their
displeasure
at
being
thrown
together
with
the
heretic
english
captain
but
an
invitation
from
the
shahbandar
was
not
something
a
prudent
trader
declined
the
night
will
be
long
however
this
is
only
your
beginning
hawksworth
passed
the
cup
to
the
shahbandar
and
stared
at
the
board
trying
to
understand
the
rules
of
the
favorite
game
of
india
from
the
moghul
the
lowliest
loitering
scribe
the
board
was
divided
into
four
quadrants
and
a
central
square
using
two
sets
of
parallel
lines
which
formed
a
large
cross
in
its
middle
each
quadrant
was
divided
into
three
rows
marked
with
spaces
for
moving
pieces
two
or
four
could
play
and
each
player
had
four
pieces
of
colored
teak
that
were
placed
initially
at
the
back
of
two
of
the
three
spaced
rows
after
each
dice
throw
pieces
were
moved
forward
one
or
more
spaces
in
a
row
until
reaching
its
end
then
up
the
next
row
until
they
reached
the
square
in
the
center
a
piece
reaching
the
center
was
called
arrived
hawksworth
remembered
that
a
double
six
allowed
him
to
move
two
of
his
pieces
those
standing
together
a
full
twelve
spaces
ahead
as
he
moved
the
pieces
forward
groans
and
oaths
in
a
number
of
languages
sounded
through
the
night
air
betting
had
been
heavy
on
the
shahbandar
who
had
challenged
both
hawksworth
and
the
senior
portuguese
captain
to
a
set
of
games
only
an
adventurous
few
in
the
crowd
would
straddle
their
wagers
and
accept
the
long
odds
that
the
english
captain
would
or
could
be
so
impractical
as
to
defeat
the
man
who
must
value
and
apply
duty
to
his
goods
did
i
tell
you
captain
hawksworth
that
favored
by
the
great
moghul
akman
the
shahbandar
rattled
the
dice
in
the
cup
for
a
long
moment
there
a
story
hundreds
of
years
old
that
once
a
ruler
of
india
sent
the
game
of
chess
what
we
call
in
india
to
persia
as
a
challenge
to
their
court
they
in
return
sent
to
india
he
paused
dramatically
it
a
lie
invented
by
a
persian
he
led
the
explosion
of
laughter
and
threw
the
dice
a
servant
called
the
numbers
and
the
laughter
died
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
the
merciful
prophet
wives
were
bengalis
he
had
thrown
three
ones
a
terrified
servant
moved
the
pieces
while
mirza
nuruddin
took
a
betel
leaf
from
a
tray
and
munched
it
sullenly
the
crowd
tension
was
almost
palpable
hawksworth
took
the
cup
and
swirled
it
again
he
absently
noted
that
the
moon
had
emerged
from
the
trees
and
was
now
directly
overhead
the
shahbandar
seemed
to
notice
it
as
well
mackintosh
watched
as
the
last
grains
of
red
marble
sand
slipped
through
the
hourglass
by
the
binnacle
and
then
he
mechanically
flipped
it
over
the
moon
now
cast
the
shadow
of
the
mainmast
yard
precisely
across
the
waist
of
the
ship
and
the
tide
had
begun
to
flow
in
rapidly
the
men
of
the
new
watch
were
silently
working
their
way
up
the
shrouds
midnight
the
tide
up
there
nae
need
to
wait
more
he
turned
to
captain
kerridge
who
stood
beside
him
on
the
quarterdeck
of
the
george
elkington
stood
directly
behind
kerridge
let
get
under
sail
elkington
tapped
out
his
pipe
on
the
railing
then
he
turned
to
kerridge
did
you
remember
to
douse
the
stern
lantern
i
give
the
orders
elkington
and
you
can
save
your
questions
for
the
pilot
captain
jonathan
kerridge
was
a
small
man
with
no
chin
and
large
bulging
eyes
he
signaled
the
quartermaster
and
the
anchor
chain
began
to
rattle
slowly
up
the
side
then
the
mainsail
dropped
hung
slack
for
a
moment
and
bellied
against
the
wind
sending
a
groan
through
the
mast
they
were
underway
the
only
light
on
board
was
a
small
shielded
lantern
by
the
binnacle
for
reading
the
large
boxed
compass
the
needle
showed
their
course
to
be
almost
due
south
toward
the
bar
at
the
mouth
of
the
tapti
on
their
right
was
the
empty
bay
and
on
their
left
the
glimmer
of
occasional
fires
from
the
shoreline
the
whipstaff
had
been
taken
by
the
indian
pilot
a
wrinkled
man
the
shahbandar
had
introduced
as
ahmet
he
spoke
a
smattering
of
portuguese
and
had
succeeded
in
explaining
that
he
could
reliably
cover
the
stretch
south
from
swalley
to
the
unloading
bar
at
the
tapti
river
mouth
in
one
turn
of
the
hourglass
if
allah
willed
with
high
tide
he
had
also
managed
to
explain
there
were
only
two
sandbars
they
would
have
to
avoid
and
there
would
be
no
hostiles
abroad
this
night
even
the
portuguese
trading
frigates
were
safely
at
anchor
off
the
river
mouth
for
this
evening
their
captains
had
been
honored
by
an
invitation
to
attend
the
gathering
at
mirza
nuruddin
estate
your
beginning
has
been
impressive
captain
hawksworth
but
now
you
must
still
maintain
your
advantage
mirza
nuruddin
watched
as
hawksworth
threw
a
double
five
and
a
two
advancing
two
of
his
four
pieces
into
the
central
square
the
crowd
groaned
coins
began
to
change
hands
you
have
gained
two
pieces
i
save
time
and
concede
this
game
but
we
have
six
more
to
play
a
bit
like
life
it
favors
those
with
endurance
as
the
board
was
cleared
for
the
next
game
mirza
nuruddin
rose
and
strode
to
the
end
of
the
court
the
wind
was
coming
up
now
as
it
always
did
on
this
monthly
night
of
full
moon
and
tide
sweeping
up
the
river
bringing
the
fresh
salt
air
of
the
sea
and
the
currents
would
be
shifting
along
the
coast
as
sandbars
one
by
one
were
submerged
by
the
incoming
tide
he
barked
an
inconsequential
order
to
a
hovering
servant
and
then
made
his
way
back
to
the
board
his
guests
parting
automatically
before
him
the
drinking
crowd
had
already
begun
to
turn
boisterous
impatient
for
the
appearance
of
the
women
as
always
the
would
remain
for
additional
entertainment
after
their
dance
in
private
quarters
available
in
the
rambling
new
palace
this
game
i
will
throw
first
the
shahbandar
seated
himself
and
watched
as
hawksworth
drew
on
a
tankard
of
brandy
especially
provided
for
the
europeans
present
then
mirza
nuruddin
made
a
deft
twist
of
the
cup
and
the
ivories
dropped
on
the
carpet
in
a
neat
row
of
three
sixes
a
servant
barked
the
numbers
and
the
crowd
pressed
forward
as
one
to
watch
fifteen
fathom
and
falling
the
bosun
leaned
back
from
the
railing
and
shouted
toward
the
quarterdeck
in
disbelief
he
quickly
drew
the
line
in
over
the
gunwale
at
the
waist
of
the
and
fed
it
out
again
now
she
reads
thirteen
fathom
kerridge
glanced
at
the
hourglass
the
sand
was
half
gone
and
the
compass
reading
still
gave
their
course
as
due
south
ahead
the
sea
was
blind
dark
but
on
the
left
the
fires
of
shore
still
flickered
now
perhaps
even
brighter
than
he
had
remembered
them
then
he
realized
a
cloud
had
drifted
momentarily
over
the
moon
and
he
told
himself
this
was
why
the
pilot
held
the
whipstaff
on
a
steady
course
i
reef
the
foresail
a
notch
and
ease
her
two
points
to
starboard
i
lay
a
hundred
sovereigns
the
current

mackintosh
ventured
to
break
protocol
and
speak
his
concern
growing
i
dinna
like
the
feel
of
this
he
told
himself
we
too
fast
i
can
feel
it
eight
fathoms
sir
the
bosun
voice
again
cut
the
dark
jesus
mackintosh
erupted
take

about
the
rotted
current
she
ride
in
three
fathom
i
sailed
the
james
six
hundred

in
less
let
her
run
he
turned
to
elkington
ask
the
moor
how
much
longer
to
the
river
mouth
george
elkington
turned
and
shot
a
stream
of
questions
rapidly
at
the
pilot
whose
eyes
glazed
in
his
partial
comprehension
he
shook
his
head
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
mean
both
yes
and
no
simultaneously
and
then
pointed
into
the
dark
and
shrugged
emitting
fragments
of
portuguese
frente

diretamente
em
then
he
gestured
toward
the
waist
of
the
ship
and
seemed
to
be
asking
the
depth
reading
as
though
in
answer
the
bosun
voice
came
again
trembling
five
fathom
and
still
dropping
cinco
elkington
translated
but
his
concerned
tone
was
a
question
what
does
it
mean
the
pilot
shouted
an
alarm
in
gujarati
and
threw
his
fragile
weight
against
the
whipstaff
the
pitched
and
shuddered
groaning
like
some
mourning
animal
at
tether
but
it
no
longer
seemed
to
respond
to
the
rudder
kerridge
glared
at
the
pilot
in
dismay
tell
the
blathering
heathen
steady
as
she
goes
she
take
the
deck
tipped
crazily
sideways
and
a
low
grind
seemed
to
pass
up
through
its
timbers
then
the
whipstaff
kicked
to
port
strained
against
its
rope
and
with
a
snap
from
somewhere
below
drifted
free
the
dangerously
into
the
wind
while
a
wave
caught
the
waist
of
the
ship
and
swept
the
bosun
and
his
sounding
line
into
the
dark
whorin
mary
mother
of
god
we
lost
the
rudder
mackintosh
lunged
down
the
companionway
toward
the
main
deck
drawing
a
heavy
knife
from
his
belt
as
the
frightened
seamen
clung
to
the
tilting
deck
and
braced
themselves
against
the
shrouds
he
began
slashing
the
lines
securing
the
main
sail
another
wave
seemed
to
catch
the
somewhere
beneath
her
stern
quarter
gallery
and
lifted
her
again
she
poised
in
midair
for
a
long
moment
then
groaned
farther
into
the
sand
as
the
frigate
tipped
mackintosh
felt
a
rumble
from
the
deck
below
and
at
that
instant
he
knew
with
perfect
certainty
the
doomed
to
go
down
a
cannon
had
snapped
its
securing
lines
and
jumped
its
blocks
he
grabbed
a
shroud
and
braced
himself
then
it
came
the
muffled
sound
of
splintering
as
the
cannon
bore
directly
through
the
hull
well
below
the
waterline
of
the
heeling
frigate
takin
water
in
the
hold
a
frightened
shout
trailed
out
through
the
scuttles
the
seamen
on
decks
still
clung
to
the
shrouds
wedging
themselves
against
the
gunwales
man
the
pumps
in
the
well
you
fatherless
pimps
mackintosh
shouted
at
the
paralyzed
seamen
knowing
it
was
already
too
late
and
then
he
began
to
sever
the
moorings
of
the
longboat
lashed
to
the
mainmast
elkington
was
clinging
to
the
lateen
mast
winding
a
safety
line
about
his
waist
and
bellowing
unintelligible
instructions
into
the
dark
for
hoisting
the
chests
of
silver
bullion
from
the
hold
no
one
on
the
quarterdeck
had
noticed
when
its
railing
splintered
sending
captain
kerridge
and
the
indian
pilot
into
the
dark
sea
the
strumpet
luck
seems
to
have
switched
her
men
tonight
captain
hawksworth
like
a
girl
when
her
rupees
are
spent
mirza
nuruddin
signaled
for
his
hookah
to
be
relighted
he
had
just
thrown
another
row
of
three
sixes
and
was
now
near
to
taking
the
seventh
game
giving
him
six
to
hawksworth
one
all
betting
on
hawksworth
had
stopped
after
the
fourth
game
but
the
infinite
will
of
god
is
always
mysterious
mercifully
granting
us
what
we
need
more
often
than
what
we
want
hawksworth
had
studied
the
last
throw
carefully
through
the
haze
of
brandy
and
he
suddenly
realized
mirza
nuruddin
had
been
cheating
by
jesus
the
dice
are
weighted
he
sets
them
up
somehow
in
the
cup
then
slides
them
quickly
across
the
carpet
damn
me
if
he
not
a
thief
but
why
bother
to
cheat
me
i
only
laid
five
sovereigns
on
the
game
he
pushed
aside
the
confusion
and
reflected
again
on
the
astounding
genius
who
sat
before
him
now
cheating
at
dice
his
plan
was
masterful
host
a
gathering
for
the
captains
at
the
bar
the
night
we
will
unload
even
the
portuguese
no
one
in
command
of
a
ship
will
be
at
the
river
mouth
no
one
who
could
possibly
interfere
all
our
wool
already
been
unladed
and
brought
overland
to
surat
then
we
transferred
the
ironwork
and
lead
on
the
the
so
all
the
lead
and
ironwork
in
cargo
will
be
unladed
by
moonlight
tonight
and
on
its
way
upriver
by
morning
before
the
portugals
here
even
sleep
off
their
liquor
and
the
be
underway
again
by
dawn
back
to
swalley
with
no
one
to
challenge
her
not
even
the
portuguese
trading
frigatta
with
their
laughable
stern
chasers
the
almost
laded
with
cotton
another
couple
of
days
should
finish
her
and
then
the
another
two
week
at
most
and
they
be
underway
the
east
india
company
the
worshipful
damned
east
india
company
will
earn
a
fortune
on
this
voyage
and
a
certain
captain
named
brian
hawksworth
will
be
toasted
the
length
of
cheapside
as
the
man
who
did
what
lancaster
could
the
man
who
sent
the
east
india
frigates
home
with
a
cargo
of
the
cheapest
pepper
in
history
the
butterbox
hollanders
will
be
buying
pepper
from
the
east
india
company
next
year
and
cursing
captain
brian
hawksworth
or
will
it
be
sir
brian
hawksworth
he
tried
the
name
on
his
tongue
as
he
swirled
the
dice
for
one
last
throw
this
time
he
tried
to
duplicate
the
shahbandar
technique
easy
swirls
and
then
just
let
them
slide
onto
the
carpet
as
you
make
some
distracting
remark
perhaps
it
allah
will
that
a
man
make
his
own
luck
is
that
written
somewhere
the
dice
slid
onto
the
carpet
and
hawksworth
reached
for
his
brandy
three
sixes
mirza
nuruddin
studied
the
three
ivories
indifferently
as
he
drew
on
his
hookah
but
traces
of
a
smile
showed
at
the
corner
of
his
lips
and
his
foggy
eyes
sparkled
for
an
instant
you
see
captain
hawksworth
you
never
know
the
hand
of
fortune
till
you
play
to
the
end
he
motioned
to
a
servant
refresh
the
english
captain
glass
i
think
he
starting
to
learn
our
game
the
longboat
scraped
crazily
across
the
deck
and
into
the
surf
then
another
wave
washed
over
the
deck
chilling
the
seamen
who
struggled
to
secure
the
longboat
line
two
chests
of
silver
bullion
newly
hoisted
from
the
hold
were
now
wedged
against
the
mainmast
elkington
clung
to
their
handles
shouting
between
waves
for
the
seamen
to
lower
them
into
the
longboat
mackintosh
ignored
him
hoist
the
line
to
the
poop
we
board
her
from
the
stern
gallery
take
the
longboat
under
and
drop
a
ladder
you
and
you
garway
and
davies
bring
the
line
about
to
the
gallery
rail
the
current
tugged
at
the
longboat
but
its
line
held
secure
and
the
seamen
passed
the
end
up
the
companionway
and
toward
the
stern
gallery
where
the
rope
ladder
was
being
played
out
the
longboat
not
take
all
the
men
and
the
silver
blessed
jesus
there
ten
thousand
pound
sterling
in
these
chests
elkington
gasped
as
another
wave
washed
over
him
sending
his
hat
into
the
surf
he
seized
a
running
seaman
by
the
neck
and
yanked
him
toward
the
chests
take
one
end
you
whoreson
bastard
and
help
hoist
it
through
the
companionway
to
the
poop
but
the
man
twisted
free
and
disappeared
toward
the
stem
with
an
oath
elkington
began
dragging
the
chest
across
the
deck
and
down
the
companionway
by
the
time
he
reached
the
gallery
the
ladder
had
already
been
dropped
into
the
longboat
and
five
seamen
were
waiting
with
i
send
you
to
hell
if
you
try
loadin
that
chest
bosun
mate
john
garway
held
his
pike
in
elkington
face
we
all
not
make
it
as
is
then
thomas
davies
acting
on
the
thought
in
every
man
mind
thrust
his
pike
through
the
lock
hinge
on
the
chest
and
wrenched
it
off
with
a
single
powerful
twist
who
needs
the
money
more
say
i
the
worshipful
company
or
a
man
who
knows
how
to
spend
it
in
moments
a
dozen
hands
had
ripped
away
the
lid
of
the
chest
and
seamen
began
shoveling
coins
into
their
pockets
elkington
was
pushed
sprawling
into
the
companionway
other
seamen
ran
to
begin
rifling
the
second
chest
silver
spilled
from
their
pockets
as
the
men
poured
down
the
swaying
ladder
into
the
longboat
as
elkington
fought
his
way
back
toward
the
stem
he
took
a
long
last
look
at
the
chests
then
began
stuffing
the
pockets
of
his
own
doublet
mackintosh
emerged
from
the
great
cabin
holding
the
ship
log
as
he
waited
for
the
last
seaman
to
board
the
longboat
he
too
lightened
the
a
pocketful
of
silver
with
all
men
on
board
the
longboat
gunwales
rode
a
scant
three
inches
above
waterline
bailing
began
after
the
first
wave
washed
over
her
then
they
hoisted
sail
and
began
to
row
for
the
dark
shore
tonight
you
may
have
been
luckier
than
you
suppose
captain
hawksworth
the
shahbandar
fingers
deftly
counted
the
five
sovereigns
through
the
leather
pouch
hawksworth
had
handed
him
around
them
the
final
side
bets
were
being
placed
against
the
portuguese
captain
who
would
play
mirza
nuruddin
next
it
hard
to
see
how
for
the
price
of
a
mere
five
sovereigns
captain
you
learned
a
truth
some
men
fail
to
master
in
a
lifetime
mirza
nuruddin
motioned
away
the
portuguese
captain
his
doublet
stained
with
wine
who
waited
to
take
his
place
at
the
board
i
really
must
call
the
dancers
now
lest
some
of
my
old
friends
lose
regard
for
our
hospitality
i
hope
you
find
them
entertaining
captain
hawksworth
if
you
never
seen
the
you
yet
to
call
yourself
a
man
hawksworth
pulled
himself
up
and
thought
about
the
river
and
slowly
worked
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
edge
of
the
marble
court
the
damp
chill
air
purged
the
torch
smoke
from
his
lungs
and
began
to
sweep
away
the
haze
of
brandy
from
his
brain
he
stared
into
the
dark
and
asked
the
winds
if
they
knew
of
the
could
it
all
have
been
a
trap
what
if
he
told
the
portugals
and
they
had
warships
waiting
without
warning
the
slow
almost
reverent
strains
of
a
sarangi
the
indian
violin
stirred
from
the
corner
of
the
courtyard
and
the
crowd
shifted
expectantly
hawksworth
turned
to
notice
that
a
carpeted
platform
had
been
erected
directly
in
the
center
of
the
court
and
as
he
watched
a
group
of
women
perhaps
twenty
slowly
began
to
mount
steps
along
its
side
the
torches
had
grown
dim
but
he
could
still
see
enough
to
tell
they
all
wore
the
veil
of
purdah
and
long
skirts
over
their
trousers
as
they
moved
chastely
toward
the
center
of
the
platform
he
thought
they
looked
remarkably
like
village
women
going
to
a
well
save
they
wore
rows
of
tiny
bells
around
their
ankles
and
heavy
bangles
on
their
wrists
the
air
was
rent
by
a
burst
of
drumming
and
the
courtyard
suddenly
flared
as
servants
threw
oil
on
the
smoldering
torches
around
the
balcony
at
that
instant
in
a
gesture
of
high
drama
the
women
ripped
away
their
turquoise
veils
and
flung
them
skyward
the
crowd
erupted
in
a
roar
hawksworth
stared
at
the
women
in
astonishment
their
skirts
the
skintight
trousers
beneath
and
their
short
halters
were
all
gossamer
completely
transparent
the
dance
was
underway
hips
jerked
spasmodically
in
perfect
time
with
the
drummer
accelerating
hypnotic
rhythms
arching
now
to
the
side
now
suggestively
forward
hawksworth
found
himself
exploring
the
dancers
faces
all
heavily
painted
and
expressionless
then
he
watched
their
hands
which
moved
in
sculptural
arcs
through
a
kind
of
sign
language
certain
indians
in
the
crowd
seemed
to
know
other
hand
messages
were
understood
by
all
as
the
women
stroked
themselves
intimately
in
what
seemed
almost
a
parody
of
sensuality
as
the
rhythm
continued
to
intensify
they
begap
to
rip
away
their
garments
one
by
one
beginning
with
their
parted
waist
wraps
next
their
halters
were
thrown
to
the
crowd
though
their
breasts
had
long
since
found
release
from
whatever
minimal
containment
they
might
have
known
at
the
beginning
of
the
dance
their
skin
now
glistened
bare
in
the
perfumed
torchlight
the
dance
seemed
to
hawksworth
to
go
on
and
on
incredibly
building
to
ever
more
frantic
levels
of
intensity
the
drunken
crowd
swayed
with
the
women
its
excitement
and
expectation
swelling
then
at
last
the
women
trousers
also
were
ripped
away
leaving
them
adorned
with
only
bangles
and
reflecting
jewels
yet
the
dance
continued
still
as
they
writhed
onto
their
knees
at
the
edge
of
the
platform
then
slowly
as
though
by
some
unseen
hand
the
platform
lowered
to
the
level
of
the
courtyard
and
they
glided
into
the
drunken
crowd
thrusting
breasts
thighs
against
the
ecstatic
onlookers
the
cheers
had
grown
deafening
hawksworth
finally
turned
away
and
walked
slowly
down
the
embankment
to
the
river
there
in
the
first
hint
of
dawn
bathers
had
begun
to
assemble
for
hindu
prayers
and
a
ritual
morning
bath
among
them
were
young
village
girls
swathed
head
to
foot
in
wraps
who
descended
one
by
one
into
the
chilled
water
and
began
to
modestly
change
garments
while
they
bathed
chastely
coiling
a
fresh
cloth
around
themselves
even
as
the
other
was
removed
they
had
never
seemed
more
beautiful
hawksworth
was
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
maidan
when
the
sail
of
the
english
longboat
showed
at
the
turn
of
the
river
news
of
the
shipwreck
had
reached
surat
by
village
runner
an
hour
after
sunup
and
barks
had
already
been
sent
to
try
to
recover
the
remaining
silver
before
the
ship
broke
apart
the
frigate
was
reportedly
no
more
than
a
thousand
yards
off
the
coast
and
all
the
men
even
kerridge
the
bosun
and
the
pilot
had
been
safely
carried
ashore
by
the
current
hawksworth
watched
the
longboat
sail
being
lowered
in
preparation
for
landing
and
tried
to
think
over
his
next
step
how
to
minimize
the
delay
and
loss
we
ca
risk
staying
on
past
another
day
or
two
not
with
only
one
vessel
if
we
caught
at
anchor
in
the
cove
there
nothing
one
ship
can
do
the
portugals
can
send
in
fireships
and
there
be
no
way
to
sink
them
with
crossfire
the
to
sail
immediately
we
enough
cotton
laded
now
to
fill
the
hold
with
pepper
in
java
damn
kerridge
why
was
he
steering
so
close
to
shore
did
he
realize
there
be
a
current
or
was
it
the
pilot
were
we
steered
into
this
disaster
on
the
orders
of
our
new
friend
mirza
nuruddin
has
he
been
playing
false
with
us
all
along
only
claiming
to
help
us
stay
clear
of
the
portugals
by
the
looks
of
the
traders
on
the
this
morning
i
can
tell
they
all
think
we
were
played
for
fools
he
tried
to
remember
all
the
shahbandar
had
said
the
night
before
particularly
the
remarks
he
had
not
understood
but
now
the
evening
seemed
swallowed
in
a
fog
of
brandy
but
the
game
he
finally
realized
had
been
more
than
a
game
the
voyage
will
be
lucky
to
break
even
now
george
elkington
slid
from
the
back
of
the
sweating
porter
and
collapsed
heavily
on
the
stone
steps
the
old
but
take
forty
thousand
pound
to
replace
her
what
do
you
plan
to
do
hawksworth
eyed
kerridge
as
he
mounted
the
steps
his
doublet
unrecognizable
under
the
smeared
mud
and
decided
to
ignore
him
not
a
damn
thing
we
can
do
now
save
lade
the
last
of
the
cotton
and
some
indigo
on
the
and
weigh
anchor
and
day
after
tomorrow
not
too
soon
by
my
thinkin
elkington
examined
hawksworth
and
silently
cursed
him
he
still
had
not
swallowed
his
disbelief
when
hawksworth
had
announced
only
three
days
before
that
he
planned
to
leave
the
ships
and
travel
to
agra
with
a
letter
from
king
james
the
shahbandar
has
asked
to
meet
with
you
hawksworth
motioned
to
elkington
as
the
last
seaman
climbed
over
the
side
of
the
longboat
and
onto
the
back
of
a
waiting
porter
we
may
as
well
go
in
a
crowd
of
the
curious
swarmed
about
them
as
they
made
their
way
across
the
and
through
the
customs
house
mirza
nuruddin
was
waiting
on
his
bolster
captain
my
sincere
condolences
to
you
and
to
elkington
please
be
sure
that
worthless
pilot
will
never
work
out
of
this
port
again
i
can
not
believe
he
was
at
fault
but
he
be
dealt
with
nonetheless
which
is
partially
true
mirza
nuruddin
told
himself
since
my
cousin
muhammad
haidar
the
rahimi
will
take
him
on
the
pilgrim
ship
for
the
next
aden
run
and
allow
him
to
work
there
until
his
reputation
is
repaired
you
were
fortunate
at
least
that
the
largest
part
of
her
cargo
had
already
been
unladed
elkington
listened
to
hawksworth
translation
his
face
growing
ever
more
florid
was
the
damned
pilot
knavery
tell
him
i
see
him
hanged
if
this
was
england
mirza
nuruddin
listened
then
sighed
perhaps
the
pilot
was
at
fault
perhaps
not
i
do
quite
know
whose
story
to
believe
but
you
should
know
that
in
india
only
the
moghul
can
impose
the
death
penalty
this
matter
of
the
pilot
is
past
saving
however
it
best
we
move
on
so
tell
me
what
do
you
propose
to
do
now
settle
our
accounts
weigh
anchor
and
be
gone
elkington
bristled
but
you
not
heard
the
last
o
the
east
india
company
i
warrant
you
we
be
back
with
a
fleet
soon
enough
and
next
time
we
do
our
own
hirin
of
a
pilot
as
you
wish
i
have
our
accountants
total
your
invoices
mirza
nuruddin
face
did
not
change
as
he
heard
the
translation
but
his
spirit
exulted
it
worked
they
be
well
at
sea
within
the
week
days
before
the
portuguese
warships
arrive
not
even
that
genius
of
intrigue
mukarrab
khan
will
know
i
planned
it
all
and
by
saving
these
greedy
english
from
certain
disaster
i
lured
to
our
seas
the
only
europeans
with
the
spirit
to
drive
out
the
portuguese
forever
after
a
century
of
humiliation
india
historic
tradition
of
free
trade
the
shahbandar
had
often
thought
had
also
brought
her
undoing
to
all
who
came
to
buy
and
sell
india
had
thrived
since
the
beginning
of
time
until
the
portuguese
came
in
those
forgotten
days
huge
arks
vast
as
eight
hundred
tons
freely
plied
the
length
of
the
arabian
sea
from
mecca
jidda
they
came
groaning
with
the
gold
silver
copper
wool
and
brocades
of
italy
greece
damascus
or
with
the
pearls
horses
silks
of
persia
and
afghanistan
they
put
in
at
india
northern
port
of
cambay
where
they
laded
india
prized
cotton
or
sailed
farther
south
to
port
of
calicut
where
they
bargained
for
the
hard
black
pepper
of
india
malabar
coast
for
ginger
and
cinnamon
from
ceylon
india
own
merchants
sailed
eastward
to
the
moluccas
where
they
bought
silks
and
porcelains
from
chinese
traders
or
cloves
nutmeg
and
mace
from
the
islanders
india
ports
linked
china
on
the
east
with
europe
on
the
west
and
touched
all
that
moved
between
the
arabian
sea
was
free
as
the
air
and
the
richest
traders
who
sailed
it
prayed
to
allah
the
one
true
god
then
a
hundred
years
ago
the
portuguese
came
they
seized
strategic
ocean
outlooks
from
the
mouth
of
the
persian
gulf
to
the
coast
of
china
on
these
they
built
strongholds
forts
to
control
not
the
lands
of
asia
but
its
seas
and
if
no
man
could
remember
the
centuries
of
freedom
today
all
knew
well
the
simple
device
that
held
the
arabian
sea
in
bondage
it
was
a
small
slip
of
paper
on
which
was
the
signature
of
a
portuguese
governor
or
the
captain
of
a
portuguese
fort
today
no
vessel
not
even
the
smallest
bark
dared
venture
the
arabian
sea
without
a
portuguese
this
hated
license
must
name
the
captain
of
a
vessel
and
verify
its
tonnage
its
cargo
its
crew
its
destination
and
its
armament
vessels
could
trade
only
at
ports
controlled
or
approved
by
the
portuguese
where
they
must
pay
a
duty
of
percent
on
all
cargo
in
and
out
indian
and
arab
vessels
no
longer
could
carry
spices
pepper
copper
or
iron
the
richest
cargo
and
now
the
monopoly
of
portuguese
shippers
an
indian
vessel
caught
at
sea
without
a
or
steering
south
when
its
stated
destination
was
north
was
confiscated
its
captain
and
crew
were
executed
immediately
if
they
were
lucky
or
sent
to
the
galleys
if
they
were
not
fleets
of
armed
galleons
cruised
the
coastlines
in
patrol
if
a
vessel
gave
cause
for
suspicion
portuguese
soldiers
boarded
her
in
full
battle
dress
with
naked
swords
and
battle
cries
of
santiago
and
while
their
commander
inspected
the
portuguese
soldiers
relieved
passengers
of
any
jewelry
salable
in
the
streets
of
goa
enforcement
was
strict
and
since
a
percentage
of
all
seized
cargo
went
to
captains
and
crews
of
patrol
galleons
enthusiastic
the
seas
off
india
were
theirs
by
right
the
portuguese
liked
to
explain
because
they
were
the
first
ever
to
have
the
ingenuity
to
make
claim
to
them
the
revenues
the
portugal
were
immense
not
because
it
was
expensive
to
obtain
it
cost
only
a
few
rupees
but
because
it
funneled
every
ounce
of
commodity
traded
in
the
arabian
sea
through
a
portuguese
tax
port
and
it
is
the
portuguese
taxes
mirza
nuruddin
told
himself
not
just
their
galleons
that
the
english
will
one
day
drive
from
our
ports
and
on
that
day
our
merchant
ships
will
again
lade
the
best
cargo
sail
the
richest
routes
return
with
the
boldest
profits
there
seems
nothing
further
then
elkington
i
can
do
for
you
the
shahbandar
smiled
and
bowed
his
small
ceremonial
salaam
save
wish
you
a
fair
wind
and
allah
blessing
so
it
over
hawksworth
thought
as
they
turned
to
leave
the
last
time
i
ever
see
you
and
thank
you
very
much
you
unscrupulous
deceiving
son
of
a
whore
captain
hawksworth
perhaps
you
and
i
can
share
a
further
word
you
are
not
as
i
understand
planning
to
depart
india
at
least
not
immediately
i
like
you
always
to
know
my
modest
offices
remain
at
your
behest
elkington
paused
as
did
hawksworth
but
one
of
the
officials
took
the
merchant
arm
and
urged
him
firmly
toward
the
door
of
the
chamber
too
firmly
hawksworth
thought
i
think
you
done
about
all
for
us
you
can
hawksworth
made
no
attempt
to
strain
the
irony
from
his
voice
be
that
as
it
may
i
heard
rumors
that
your
trip
to
agra
may
be
approved
should
that
happen
you
must
know
you
can
not
travel
alone
captain
no
man
in
india
is
that
foolhardy
the
roads
here
are
no
more
safe
than
those
so
i
hear
in
europe
all
travelers
inland
need
a
guide
and
an
armed
escort
are
you
proposing
to
help
me
secure
a
guide
equal
in
competence
may
i
presume
to
the
pilot
you
hired
for
the
captain
hawksworth
please
god
will
is
mysterious
he
sighed
no
man
can
thwart
mischance
if
it
is
his
destiny
hear
me
out
i
have
just
learned
there
currently
a
man
in
surat
who
knows
the
road
to
burhanpur
like
his
own
sword
handle
in
fact
he
only
just
arrived
from
the
east
and
i
understand
he
expects
to
return
when
his
affairs
here
apparently
brief
are
by
a
fortuitous
coincidence
he
happens
to
have
an
armed
escort
of
guards
with
him
i
suggest
it
might
be
wise
to
attempt
to
engage
him
while
you
still
have
a
chance
and
who
is
this
man
a
rajput
captain
with
the
army
a
soldier
of
no
small
reputation
i
can
assure
you
his
name
is
vasant
rao
mukarrab
khan
reread
the
order
carefully
scrutinized
the
black
ink
seal
at
the
top
of
the
page
to
assure
himself
it
was
indeed
the
moghul
and
then
placed
it
aside
so
at
last
it
had
come
the
prospect
of
english
presents
was
too
great
a
temptation
for
the
acquisitive
arangbar
ever
anxious
for
new
baubles
the
englishman
would
be
going
to
agra
no
one
at
court
could
have
prevented
it
but
that
road
east
through
chopda
to
burhanpur
then
north
the
long
road
through
mandu
ujjain
and
gwalior
to
agra
was
a
journey
of
two
hard
months
the
moghul
seal
meant
less
than
nothing
to
highwaymen
or
to
servants
and
drivers
whose
loyalties
were
always
for
sale
it
a
long
road
englishman
and
mishaps
on
that
road
are
common
as
summer
mildew
he
smiled
to
himself
and
took
up
the
other
bamboo
tube
it
had
arrived
by
the
same
runner
the
date
on
the
outside
was
one
week
old
it
always
amazed
mukarrab
khan
that
india
runners
the
mewras
were
actually
swifter
than
post
horses
this
message
had
traveled
the
three
hundred
from
agra
to
burhanpur
and
then
the
remaining
hundred
and
fifty
to
surat
a
combined
distance
of
almost
seven
hundred
english
miles
in
only
seven
days
runners
were
stationed
at
posts
spaced
five
along
the
great
road
that
akman
had
built
to
link
agra
to
the
seaport
of
surat
they
wore
an
identifying
plume
at
their
head
and
two
bells
at
their
belt
and
they
gained
energy
by
eating
a
mixture
of
opium
and
hemp
extract
akman
even
conceived
of
lining
the
sides
of
the
road
with
white
stones
so
his
mewras
could
run
in
darkest
midnight
without
lanterns
there
were
now
some
four
thousand
runners
stationed
along
india
five
main
arteries
the
only
things
swifter
mukarrab
khan
had
often
told
himself
are
lightning
and
a
blue
rath
pigeon
a
distance
requiring
a
full
day
for
a
runner
could
be
covered
by
a
pigeon
in
one
three
hours
given
good
weather
arangbar
kept
pigeons
all
over
india
even
in
surat
but
then
so
did
everyone
else
at
court
recently
it
seemed
everyone
was
training
pigeons
next
to
the
date
was
the
seal
of
nadir
sharif
prime
minister
and
brother
of
the
queen
mukarrab
khan
knew
nadir
sharif
well
a
dispatch
from
nadir
sharif
though
it
always
reflected
the
wishes
of
the
moghul
or
the
queen
could
be
relied
upon
to
be
reasonable
if
the
moghul
in
fury
condemned
a
man
over
some
trivial
transgression
nadir
sharif
always
forgot
to
deliver
the
sentence
until
the
next
day
having
found
that
arangbar
often
tended
to
reverse
sentences
of
death
when
musing
in
his
evening
wine
cups
this
order
will
be
reasonable
mukarrab
khan
told
himself
but
it
will
have
to
be
obeyed
eventually
as
always
mukarrab
khan
tried
to
guess
the
message
before
unsealing
the
silver
cap
attached
to
the
end
of
the
tube
probably
taxes
late
delivery
or
perhaps
there
been
a
discrepancy
between
the
open
report
filed
from
my
chamber
by
the
wakianavis
the
public
reportefs
and
the
private
report
which
i
supposedly
do
not
see
sent
directly
to
the
moghul
by
the
harkaras
the
confidential
reporters
and
if
that
the
complaint
it
will
disprove
my
suspicion
that
no
one
in
the
imperial
chancery
ever
actually
reads
the
reports
i
deliberately
inserted
a
difference
of
lakh
of
rupees
as
reported
logged
at
the
mint
last
month
just
to
see
if
they
would
catch
it
mukarrab
khan
unrolled
the
dispatch
and
his
heart
stopped
clasping
the
paper
he
wandered
distractedly
out
of
the
audience
hall
and
down
the
stairs
toward
the
courtyard
when
he
reached
the
veranda
he
only
the
heavy
clouds
threatening
in
the
west
toward
the
sea
and
the
moist
air
promising
one
last
spatter
of
the
monsoon
servants
were
removing
the
tapestried
canopy
that
shaded
his
cushioned
bench
and
when
they
saw
him
they
discreetly
melted
out
of
sight
leaving
one
side
of
the
cloth
still
dangling
from
the
poles
he
dropped
heavily
onto
the
bench
and
reread
the
order
carefully
his
disbelief
growing
on
the
recommendation
of
queen
janahara
mukarrab
khan
had
just
been
appointed
india
first
ambassador
to
portuguese
goa
he
would
leave
in
two
weeks
chapter
twelve
the
moon
was
high
bathing
the
sleeping
veranda
in
a
wash
of
glistening
silver
and
the
air
was
deliciously
moist
heavy
with
perfume
from
the
garden
below
from
somewhere
among
the
distant
rooftops
came
the
thread
of
a
man
voice
intoning
a
melody
trilling
out
wordless
syllables
like
some
intense
poetry
of
sound
hawksworth
leaned
back
against
one
of
the
carved
posts
supporting
the
canopy
above
his
sleeping
couch
and
explored
kali
body
with
his
gaze
as
a
mariner
might
search
a
map
for
unknown
islands
and
inlets
she
lounged
opposite
him
resting
against
an
oblong
velvet
bolster
examining
him
with
eyes
while
she
drew
contentedly
on
a
hookah
fired
with
black
tobacco
and
a
concentrated
arabs
called
her
hair
hung
loose
in
gleaming
black
strands
reaching
almost
to
her
waist
and
her
head
was
circled
by
a
thin
tiara
of
gold
and
pearls
supporting
the
large
green
emerald
that
always
hung
suspended
in
the
center
of
her
forehead
even
when
she
made
love
the
gold
she
wore
long
bracelets
at
her
wrists
and
upper
arms
swinging
earrings
even
tiny
bells
at
her
ankles
seemed
to
excite
her
in
a
way
hawksworth
could
never
understand
her
eyes
and
eyebrows
were
and
her
lips
carefully
painted
a
deep
red
matching
the
color
of
her
fingernails
and
toenails
and
as
always
she
had
dyed
her
palms
and
the
soles
of
her
feet
red
with
henna
four
different
strands
of
pearls
hung
in
perfect
array
beneath
her
transparent
blouse
glistening
white
against
her
delicate
skin
he
noticed
too
that
her
nipples
had
been
rouged
and
told
himself
this
was
the
only
thing
about
her
that
recalled
the
women
in
london
tonight
your
thoughts
were
far
away
my
love
do
you
weary
of
me
so
soon
she
laid
aside
the
the
rubber
ring
impregnated
with
powdered
hair
that
she
often
asked
him
to
wear
for
her
then
took
a
vial
of
rose
attar
from
beside
the
couch
and
dabbed
herself
absently
along
the
arms
tell
me
the
truth
are
you
now
beginning
to
recoil
from
women
like
so
many
bragging
and
posturing
men
i
known
and
to
long
for
a
boy
who
fears
to
seek
his
own
pleasure
or
a
subservient
whose
parts
are
dry
from
lack
of
desire
hawksworth
studied
her
for
a
moment
without
replying
in
truth
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
your
nightly
visits
to
this
couch
have
been
the
most
astonishing
experience
of
my
life
to
imagine
i
once
thought
being
with
the
same
woman
night
after
night
would
eventually
grow
monotonous
but
you
always
come
here
as
someone
different
always
with
something
new
you
play
on
my
senses
like
an
instrument
with
touch
with
scent
with
tongue
until
they
seem
to
merge
with
my
mind
or
is
it
the
reverse
but
you
right
when
you
say
the
mind
must
surrender
itself
first
when
that
done
when
the
mind
is
given
up
to
the
body
then
you
somehow
forget
your
own
self
and
think
only
of
the
other
and
eventually
there
grows
a
union
of
pleasure
a
bond
that
intense
overwhelming
but
tonight
he
could
not
repress
his
vagrant
mind
his
feeling
of
failure
churned
too
deep
it
had
stolen
his
spirit
day
after
tomorrow
the
weighs
anchor
he
told
himself
with
half
the
cargo
we
planned
and
twice
the
men
she
needs
while
the
slowly
breaks
apart
on
a
sandbar
i
failed
the
company
and
myself
and
there
nothing
that
can
be
done
kali
dear
kali
the
woman
i
really
want
to
be
with
tonight
is
shirin
why
ca
i
drive
her
from
my
mind
half
the
time
when
you
in
my
arms
i
pretend
you
her
do
you
sense
that
too
i
sorry
i
not
myself
tonight
you
right
as
always
he
marveled
the
mind
and
the
body
are
one
as
he
paused
the
voice
cut
the
stillness
between
them
how
did
you
know
it
my
duty
as
your
courtesan
to
feel
your
moods
and
to
try
to
lift
the
weight
of
the
world
from
your
heart
you
do
it
very
well
it
just
that
sometimes
there
too
much
to
lift
he
studied
her
wondering
what
she
was
really
thinking
then
leaned
back
and
looked
at
the
stars
tell
me
what
do
you
do
when
the
world
weighs
on
you
that
never
your
worry
my
love
i
here
to
think
of
you
not
you
of
me
tell
me
anyway
say
it
a
curiosity
what
do
i
do
she
smiled
wistfully
and
drew
again
on
the
hookah
sending
a
tiny
gurgle
into
the
quiet
i
escape
with
and
i
remember
when
i
was
in
agra
in
the
she
lay
aside
the
mouthpiece
of
the
hookah
and
began
to
roll
betel
leaves
for
them
both
carefully
measuring
in
a
portion
of
nutmeg
her
favorite
aphrodisiac
tell
me
how
you
came
to
be
here
away
from
agra
is
it
really
me
you
wish
to
hear
about
she
looked
at
him
squarely
her
voice
quiet
or
is
it
shirin
you
hawksworth
lied
and
absently
stroked
the
edge
of
her
foot
where
the
henna
line
began
then
he
looked
into
her
dark
eyes
and
he
knew
she
knew
will
we
make
love
again
if
i
tell
you
possibly
i
know
how
to
make
you
keep
your
promise
she
took
his
toe
in
her
mouth
and
brushed
it
playfully
with
her
tongue
before
biting
it
ever
so
lightly
so
i
will
tell
you
anything
you
want
to
know
he
scarcely
knew
where
to
start
what
was
it
about
the
harem
the
that
you
liked
so
much
she
sighed
we
had
everything
there
wine
and
sweet
and
we
bribed
the
eunuchs
to
bring
us
opium
and
nutmeg
and
tobacco
we
could
wear
tight
trousers
which
none
of
the
women
here
in
surat
dare
for
fear
the
mullahs
will
condemn
them
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
grew
distant
we
wore
jewels
the
way
women
in
surat
wear
scarves
and
silks
from
china
the
way
they
wear
their
dreary
cotton
here
there
was
always
music
dance
and
we
had
all
the
perfumes
musk
scented
oil
attar
of
rose
we
could
want
the
moghul
had
melons
brought
by
runner
from
kabul
pomegranates
and
pears
from
samarkand
apples
from
kashmir
pineapples
from
goa
she
remembered
herself
and
reached
to
place
a
rolled
betel
leaf
in
his
mouth
about
the
only
thing
we
were
supposed
to
have
was
cucumbers
she
giggled
and
took
a
betel
leaf
for
herself
i
think
his
majesty
was
afraid
he
might
suffer
in
comparison
but
we
bribed
the
eunuchs
and
got
them
anyway
and
we
also
pleasured
each
other
hawksworth
studied
her
not
quite
sure
whether
to
believe
it
all
heard
the
harems
of
the
turks
in
the
levant
are
said
to
be
like
some
sort
of
prison
was
it
like
that
not
at
all
she
smiled
easily
a
bit
too
easily
he
thought
we
used
to
take
trips
to
the
countryside
or
even
go
with
his
majesty
when
he
went
to
kashmir
in
the
hot
summer
in
a
way
we
were
freer
than
the
poor
third
wife
of
some
stingy
merchant
but
were
you
always
under
guard
of
course
you
know
the
word
is
actually
arabic
for
sanctuary
here
we
call
it
by
the
persian
name
but
still
the
same
it
really
a
city
of
women
all
cities
must
have
guards
but
we
each
received
a
salary
and
were
like
government
officials
with
our
own
servants
we
each
had
our
own
apartment
immense
and
decorated
with
paintings
and
bubbling
fountains
at
the
door
except
there
were
no
doors
since
we
were
always
supposed
to
be
open
to
receive
his
majesty
was
there
anything
about
it
you
did
like
he
examined
her
skeptically
it
seems
to
me
i
could
list
a
few
drawbacks
a
few
things
i
did
like
the
intrigues
all
the
women
scheming
how
to
lure
his
majesty
to
their
apartment
and
giving
him
aphrodisiacs
to
try
to
prolong
his
time
there
the
beautiful
ones
were
constantly
afraid
of
being
poisoned
or
spied
on
by
the
older
women
and
the
female
slaves
and
some
of
the
women
were
always
trying
to
bribe
eunuchs
to
bring
in
young
men
disguised
as
she
took
the
stem
of
a
flower
and
began
to
weave
it
between
his
toes
but
there
are
always
intrigues
anywhere
it
the
price
we
pay
for
life
you
never
told
me
how
you
came
to
be
in
the
the
first
place
were
you
bought
the
way
women
are
in
the
levant
kali
burst
into
laughter
can
be
such
simpletons
sometimes
what
wonderful
legends
must
be
told
in
this
place
called
europe
then
she
sobered
i
was
there
because
my
mother
was
very
clever
the
is
powerful
and
she
did
everything
she
could
to
get
me
there
she
knew
if
his
majesty
liked
me
there
could
be
a
good
post
for
my
father
she
planned
it
for
years
and
when
i
finally
reached
fifteen
she
took
me
to
the
annual
mina
bazaar
that
arangbar
always
holds
on
the
persian
new
year
just
like
his
father
akman
did
what
that
it
a
mock
held
on
the
grounds
of
the
palace
and
only
women
can
go
anyone
who
wants
to
be
seen
by
his
majesty
sets
up
a
stall
made
of
silk
and
gauze
and
pretends
to
sell
handiwork
things
like
lace
and
perfume
but
no
woman
can
get
in
who
is
beautiful
was
that
where
the
moghul
first
saw
you
of
course
arangbar
came
to
visit
all
the
stalls
riding
around
on
a
litter
that
some
tartar
women
from
the
surrounded
by
his
eunuchs
he
would
pretend
to
bargain
for
the
handiwork
calling
the
women
pretty
thieves
but
he
was
really
inspecting
them
and
the
daughters
they
brought
i
was
there
with
my
mother
and
i
wore
a
thin
silk
blouse
because
my
breasts
were
lovely
she
paused
and
looked
at
him
hopefully
brushing
a
finger
across
one
nipple
you
think
they
still
are
a
little
everything
about
you
is
beautiful
it
was
all
too
true
as
he
looked
at
her
he
told
himself
he
much
preferred
her
now
to
how
she
must
have
looked
at
fifteen
well
i
suppose
arangbar
must
have
thought
so
too
because
the
next
day
he
sent
a
broker
to
pay
my
mother
to
let
me
come
to
the
hawksworth
paused
then
forced
nonchalance
into
his
voice
did
shirin
or
her
mother
do
the
same
of
course
not
kali
seemed
appalled
at
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
she
persian
her
father
was
already
some
kind
of
official
he
was
far
too
dignified
to
allow
his
women
to
go
to
the
mina
bazaar
the
moghul
must
have
seen
her
somewhere
else
but
if
he
wanted
her
her
father
could
not
refuse
what
eventually
happened
to
you
and
to
her
she
became
his
favorite
kali
took
out
her
betel
leaf
and
tossed
it
aside
that
always
very
dangerous
she
was
in
great
trouble
after
the
queen
came
to
agra
i
heard
something
about
that
he
found
himself
wanting
to
hear
a
lot
more
about
it
but
he
held
back
and
what
happened
to
you
after
you
entered
the
his
majesty
only
came
to
me
once
as
was
his
duty
she
laughed
but
there
was
no
mirth
in
her
voice
remember
i
was
only
fifteen
then
i
knew
nothing
about
lovemaking
though
i
tried
very
hard
to
please
him
but
by
that
time
he
was
already
entranced
with
shirin
he
began
to
call
for
her
almost
every
afternoon
so
what
did
you
do
after
that
i
began
to
make
love
to
the
other
women
there
i
suppose
it
sounds
strange
to
you
but
i
found
i
actually
enjoyed
other
women
bodies
very
much
were
you
ever
lonely
a
little
but
i
lonely
here
sometimes
too
she
paused
and
looked
away
a
courtesan
is
always
lonely
no
man
will
ever
truly
love
her
he
listen
to
her
sing
to
him
and
joke
with
him
but
his
heart
will
never
be
hers
regardless
of
all
the
sweet
promises
he
think
to
make
her
hawksworth
watched
her
quickly
mask
the
sadness
in
her
eyes
as
she
reached
for
the
hookah
at
that
moment
he
wanted
more
than
anything
in
the
world
to
tell
her
it
was
always
true
but
he
knew
she
would
hate
the
lie
instead
he
took
out
his
own
betel
leaf
and
cleared
his
throat
awkwardly
you
never
told
me
how
you
came
to
be
called
kali
mukarrab
khan
said
that
not
your
real
name
she
looked
at
him
and
her
eyes
became
ice
he
a
truly
vicious
man
what
did
he
say
that
you
would
tell
me
he
paused
bewildered
do
you
want
to
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
a
quick
motion
why
not
you
may
as
well
know
before
someone
else
tells
you
but
please
try
to
understand
i
was
very
lonely
you
ca
know
how
lonely
it
becomes
in
the
how
you
long
for
a
man
to
touch
you
just
once
you
ca
imagine
after
a
while
you
become
sort
of
mad
it
becomes
your
obsession
can
you
understand
even
a
little
i
seen
men
at
sea
for
months
at
a
time
i
could
tell
you
a
few
stories
about
that
that
might
shock
you
she
laughed
nothing
absolutely
nothing
shocks
me
any
more
but
now
i
shock
you
there
was
this
beautiful
eunuch
who
guarded
the
at
night
he
was
abyssinian
very
tall
and
striking
and
he
was
named
abnus
because
he
was
the
color
of
ebony
he
was
truly
exquisite
a
eunuch
hawksworth
stared
at
her
disbelieving
i
always
thought
she
stopped
him
i
probably
know
what
you
always
thought
but
eunuchs
are
not
all
the
same
the
bengali
eunuchs
like
mukarrab
khan
has
were
sold
by
their
parents
when
they
were
very
young
and
they
had
everything
cut
away
with
a
razor
muslim
merchants
buy
boys
in
bengal
and
take
them
to
egypt
where
coptic
monks
specialize
in
the
operation
that
the
type
called
they
even
have
to
pass
water
through
a
straw
but
the
operation
is
so
dangerous
few
of
the
boys
live
so
they
very
expensive
abnus
had
been
sent
to
his
majesty
as
a
gift
from
some
arab
merchant
who
was
so
stingy
he
simply
crushed
the
testicles
of
one
of
his
grown
slaves
instead
of
buying
a
bengali
boy
no
one
realized
abnus
could
still
do
almost
everything
any
man
can
do
it
was
our
secret
so
you
made
love
to
a
eunuch
hawksworth
found
himself
incredulous
kali
smiled
and
nodded
then
one
day
our
kashmiri
ward
servant
entered
my
apartment
unannounced
she
had
suspected
us
i
did
know
until
that
moment
she
was
a
spy
for
the
palace
she
stopped
and
a
small
shiver
seemed
to
pass
through
her
we
were
both
condemned
to
death
i
did
care
i
did
want
to
live
anyway
he
was
killed
the
next
day
left
on
a
pike
to
die
in
the
sun
kali
paused
and
her
lips
quivered
slightly
then
she
continued
i
was
buried
up
to
the
neck
in
the
courtyard
to
watch
him
die
then
in
late
afternoon
some
imperial
guards
came
and
uncovered
me
and
they
took
me
back
into
the
palace
i
was
delirious
they
took
me
into
this
room
and
there
she
was
who
queen
janahara
she
offered
me
a
chance
to
live
i
did
know
what
i
was
doing
where
i
was
anything
before
i
thought
i
already
agreed
at
last
a
tear
came
and
i
never
told
anyone
i
so
ashamed
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
stiffened
but
i
never
done
what
i
told
her
i
would
do
not
once
what
was
that
kali
looked
at
him
and
laughed
to
come
here
with
mukarrab
khan
and
spy
on
shirin
so
now
and
then
i
just
send
some
silly
nonsense
to
her
majesty
i
know
what
shirin
is
doing
and
i
admire
her
for
it
hawksworth
tried
to
keep
his
voice
even
what
exactly
is
it
doing
kali
stopped
abruptly
and
stared
at
him
that
the
one
thing
i
tell
you
but
i
will
tell
you
that
i
now
also
supposed
to
be
spying
on
you
too
for
khan
sahib
she
laughed
again
but
you
never
say
anything
for
me
to
report
hawksworth
found
himself
stunned
before
he
could
speak
she
continued
but
you
asked
about
my
name
it
probably
the
real
reason
i
despise
janahara
so
much
before
i
was
named
mira
my
father
was
hakim
ali
and
he
came
to
india
from
arabia
back
when
akman
was
moghul
but
the
queen
said
i
could
never
use
those
names
again
she
said
that
because
i
caused
abnus
death
she
was
renaming
me
kali
the
name
the
hindus
have
for
their
bloodthirsty
goddess
of
death
and
destruction
she
said
it
would
remind
me
always
of
what
i
done
i
hate
the
name
then
i
call
you
mira
she
took
his
hand
and
brushed
it
against
her
cheek
it
does
matter
now
besides
i
probably
never
see
you
again
after
tonight
tomorrow
you
be
getting
ready
to
leave
for
agra
khan
sahib
told
me
i
not
to
come
to
you
any
more
after
this
i
think
he
very
upset
about
something
that
happened
with
your
ships
i
very
upset
about
it
too
hawksworth
studied
her
what
exactly
did
he
say
no
i
told
you
enough
already
too
much
she
pinched
his
toe
now
you
will
keep
your
promise
my
love
and
then
after
tonight
you
can
forget
me
hawksworth
was
watching
her
entranced
i
never
forget
you
she
tried
to
smile
oh
yes
you
will
i
know
men
better
than
that
but
i
always
remember
you
when
a
man
and
a
woman
share
their
bodies
with
each
other
a
bond
is
made
between
them
it
never
entirely
forgotten
at
least
by
me
so
tonight
our
last
night
i
want
you
to
let
me
give
you
something
of
mine
to
keep
she
reached
under
the
couch
and
withdrew
a
box
teakwood
and
trimmed
in
gold
she
placed
it
on
the
velvet
tapestry
between
them
i
never
shown
this
to
a
before
but
i
want
you
to
have
it
to
make
you
remember
me
at
least
for
a
while
i
never
had
a
present
from
an
indian
woman
before
hawksworth
carefully
opened
the
box
gold
latch
inside
was
a
book
bound
in
leather
and
gilded
with
exquisite
calligraphy
on
its
cover
it
called
the
the
pleasures
of
women
it
was
written
over
a
hundred
years
ago
by
a
brahmin
poet
who
called
himself
kalyana
mai
he
wrote
it
in
sanskrit
for
his
patron
the
viceroy
of
gujarat
the
same
province
where
you
are
now
but
why
are
you
giving
it
to
me
hawksworth
looked
into
her
eyes
i
remember
you
without
a
book
i
promise
and
i
remember
you
you
given
me
much
pleasure
but
there
are
those
in
india
who
believe
the
union
of
man
and
woman
should
be
more
than
pleasure
the
hindus
believe
this
union
is
an
expression
of
all
the
sacred
forces
of
life
you
know
i
not
a
hindu
i
a
muslim
courtesan
so
for
me
lovemaking
is
only
to
give
you
pleasure
but
i
want
you
to
know
there
still
more
beyond
what
we
had
together
beyond
my
skills
and
knowledge
according
to
the
hindu
teachings
the
union
of
male
and
female
is
a
way
to
reach
the
divine
nature
why
i
want
you
to
have
this
book
it
describes
the
many
different
orders
of
women
and
tells
how
to
share
pleasure
with
each
it
tells
of
many
things
beyond
what
i
know
she
took
the
leatherbound
copy
of
the
and
opened
it
to
the
first
page
the
calligraphy
was
bold
and
sensuous
in
this
book
kalyana
mai
explains
that
there
are
four
orders
of
women
the
three
highest
orders
he
calls
the
lotus
woman
the
art
woman
and
the
conch
woman
the
rest
he
dismisses
as
elephant
women
hawksworth
took
the
book
and
examined
its
pages
for
a
time
there
were
many
paintings
small
colored
miniatures
of
couples
pleasuring
one
another
in
postures
that
seemed
astounding
finally
he
mounted
his
courage
which
of
woman
are
you
i
think
i
must
be
the
third
order
the
conch
woman
the
book
says
that
the
conch
woman
delights
in
clothes
flowers
red
ornaments
that
she
is
given
to
fits
of
amorous
passion
which
make
her
head
and
mind
confused
and
at
the
moment
of
exquisite
pleasure
she
thrusts
her
nails
into
the
man
flesh
have
you
ever
noticed
me
do
that
hawksworth
felt
the
scratches
along
his
chest
and
smiled
only
in
india
he
thought
could
you
make
love
so
many
ways
all
kneeling
before
a
woman
rather
than
lying
with
her
so
she
scratches
you
on
the
chest
so
far
it
sounds
a
bit
like
you
and
it
says
the
conch
woman
love
cleft
what
the
hindus
call
her
yoni
is
always
moist
with
the
love
seed
and
its
taste
is
salt
does
that
also
remind
you
of
me
hawksworth
was
startled
with
wry
delight
when
he
realized
he
actually
knew
the
answer
something
he
never
had
the
slightest
desire
to
know
about
a
woman
in
england
in
england
where
baths
were
limited
to
the
face
neck
hands
and
feet
and
those
only
once
every
few
weeks
where
women
wore
unwashed
petticoats
and
stays
until
they
literally
fell
off
where
a
member
of
the
peerage
was
recently
quoted
as
complaining
the
nobler
parts
are
never
in
this
island
washed
by
the
women
they
are
left
to
be
lathered
by
the
men
but
kali
was
scrubbed
and
perfumed
each
day
like
a
flower
and
she
had
taught
him
the
pleasure
in
the
taste
of
all
her
body
i
guess
that
makes
you
a
conch
woman
but
what
are
the
others
supposed
to
be
like
let
me
tell
you
what
it
says
she
reached
and
took
back
the
book
the
next
one
the
art
woman
has
a
voice
like
a
peacock
and
she
delights
in
singing
and
poetry
her
carnal
desire
may
be
less
strong
than
the
conch
woman
at
least
until
she
properly
aroused
but
then
her
salila
hot
with
a
perfume
like
honey
and
it
abundant
producing
a
sound
with
the
act
of
union
she
is
sensuous
but
for
her
lovemaking
is
always
a
kind
of
art
who
would
be
an
art
woman
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
wryly
i
think
shirin
the
one
who
fascinates
you
so
much
may
well
be
an
art
woman
but
i
do
know
her
body
well
but
i
will
hawksworth
told
himself
i
know
all
of
her
somehow
i
swear
it
and
what
about
the
lotus
woman
according
to
kalyana
mai
she
actually
the
highest
order
of
woman
she
a
spiritual
being
who
loves
to
converse
with
teachers
and
hindu
priests
she
always
very
beautiful
never
dark
and
her
breasts
are
full
and
high
her
like
an
opening
lotus
bud
and
her
salila
perfumed
like
a
lily
newly
burst
and
who
would
be
a
lotus
woman
the
only
one
i
ever
known
for
sure
is
in
agra
now
she
a
classical
dancer
a
hindu
temple
dancer
her
name
is
kamala
i
saw
a
few
dancers
recently
at
the
shahbandar
estate
house
in
my
opinion
they
were
of
a
very
high
order
those
were
girls
common
whores
they
degrade
and
debase
the
classical
dance
of
india
for
the
purpose
of
enticing
customers
kamala
is
nothing
like
them
she
a
great
artist
for
her
the
dance
and
lovemaking
are
a
kind
of
worship
of
the
hindu
gods
i
do
entirely
understand
it
but
i
could
sense
her
power
the
one
time
i
saw
her
dance
when
i
saw
her
i
began
to
believe
what
people
say
that
she
embodies
the
female
principle
the
divine
female
principle
that
defines
india
for
the
hindu
people
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
she
very
different
from
anyone
here
in
surat
she
knows
things
that
no
one
else
knows
people
say
they
explained
in
a
very
old
book
she
has
how
can
there
possibly
be
any
more
to
know
hawksworth
thought
of
the
hundreds
of
pleasure
tricks
kali
had
taught
him
delights
unknown
in
europe
what
left
to
put
in
this
other
book
her
book
is
one
i
never
actually
seen
i
only
heard
about
it
it
a
sacred
text
of
the
hindus
an
ancient
sutra
in
which
the
union
of
man
and
woman
are
shown
to
be
a
way
of
finding
your
own
divine
natures
the
god
within
you
both
i
told
it
called
the
kama
sutra
the
scripture
of
love
and
pleasure
hawksworth
found
himself
beginning
to
be
overwhelmed
maybe
better
start
with
this
book
what
exactly
does
it
say
the
explains
that
each
order
of
woman
must
be
aroused
must
be
awakened
to
her
pleasure
in
a
different
way
at
different
times
of
day
with
different
caresses
different
kinds
of
kisses
and
scratches
and
bites
different
words
different
embraces
during
union
it
says
if
you
learn
to
know
women
well
you
will
understand
how
to
give
and
receive
the
greatest
enjoyment
with
each
is
it
really
so
complicated
now
you
starting
to
sound
like
some
muslim
men
i
know
who
lock
their
women
away
and
make
love
to
boys
claiming
women
are
insatiable
with
desires
ten
times
stronger
than
those
of
a
man
but
actually
afraid
of
a
woman
so
they
believe
she
to
be
enjoyed
quickly
and
as
little
as
possible
they
care
nothing
for
her
own
pleasure
but
a
woman
must
be
aroused
to
enjoy
union
to
its
fullest
that
why
this
book
is
so
important
i
happen
to
think
you
are
one
who
cares
about
a
woman
pleasure
hawksworth
stroked
her
smooth
leg
mischievously
then
took
the
book
and
gently
laid
it
aside
tell
me
what
it
says
about
a
conch
woman
what
have
i
been
doing
that
right
and
wrong
the
book
says
that
the
conch
woman
prefers
union
with
a
man
in
the
third
of
the
night
when
is
that
time
is
counted
in
india
by
the
day
and
the
night
are
each
divided
into
four
the
first
the
night
would
be
between
six
and
nine
in
the
evening
by
the
third
be
your
hours
between
midnight
and
three
in
the
morning
is
that
not
the
very
time
i
come
to
your
couch
that
convenient
it
also
says
that
on
certain
days
of
the
moon
which
it
tells
the
conch
woman
particularly
enjoys
having
her
body
pressed
with
the
nails
of
the
man
some
days
roughly
some
days
gently
and
on
certain
days
the
embrace
must
be
forceful
on
certain
days
gentle
there
are
many
special
ways
to
touch
and
embrace
a
conch
woman
and
they
are
explained
here
also
there
are
certain
ways
of
kissing
her
of
biting
her
of
scratching
her
for
example
you
may
kiss
her
upper
lip
or
her
lower
lip
or
you
may
kiss
her
with
your
tongue
only
and
how
am
i
supposed
to
be
able
to
kiss
you
with
my
tongue
only
hawksworth
cast
a
skeptical
glance
at
the
book
it
very
easy
she
smiled
at
him
slyly
perhaps
it
easier
if
i
show
you
she
took
his
lower
lip
gently
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
passed
her
tongue
over
it
slowly
and
languorously
and
then
suddenly
nipped
it
playfully
he
started
in
surprise
there
you
see
there
are
many
ways
to
please
a
woman
to
kiss
her
to
bite
her
to
scratch
her
when
you
have
become
a
true
lover
of
women
my
strong
you
will
know
them
all
hawksworth
shifted
uncomfortably
what
next
the
book
also
tells
of
the
bodies
of
women
foolish
men
often
do
not
know
these
things
my
love
but
i
think
you
are
beginning
to
learn
it
tells
that
in
the
upper
cleft
of
the
a
small
organ
it
likens
to
a
sprouting
from
the
ground
this
is
the
seat
of
pleasure
in
a
woman
and
when
it
is
excited
kama
salila
in
profusion
and
then
when
the
woman
is
ready
you
may
both
enjoy
the
act
of
union
to
its
fullest
and
there
are
many
many
ways
this
may
be
done
the
book
tells
of
it
is
the
great
wisdom
of
kalyana
mai
that
a
woman
must
have
variety
in
her
love
couch
if
she
does
not
find
this
with
one
man
she
will
seek
others
it
is
the
same
with
men
i
think
hawksworth
nodded
noncommittally
not
wishing
to
appear
overly
enthusiastic
finally
he
tells
the
importance
of
a
woman
reaching
her
moment
of
enjoyment
if
she
does
not
she
will
be
unsatisfied
and
may
seek
pleasure
elsewhere
in
india
a
woman
is
taught
to
signify
this
moment
by
the
the
drawing
in
of
breath
between
the
closed
teeth
there
are
many
different
ways
a
woman
may
do
this
but
you
will
know
my
love
enough
of
the
book
he
took
it
and
replaced
it
in
the
box
somehow
i
think
i
already
had
a
lot
of
its
lessons
that
was
merely
my
duty
to
you
to
be
a
new
woman
for
you
each
night
and
i
think
you
learned
well
she
took
the
box
and
settled
it
beside
the
couch
then
she
laughed
lightly
but
you
still
have
a
few
things
to
learn
tonight
for
our
last
time
together
i
will
show
you
the
most
erotic
embrace
i
know
she
examined
him
with
her
eyes
and
drew
one
last
burst
of
smoke
from
the
hookah
then
she
carefully
positioned
the
large
velvet
bolster
in
the
center
of
the
couch
are
you
capable
of
it
try
me
very
well
but
i
must
be
deeply
aroused
to
enjoy
this
fully
come
and
let
me
show
you
all
the
places
you
must
bite
the
sun
was
directly
overhead
when
vasant
rao
reined
his
stallion
to
a
halt
at
the
abidjan
gate
behind
him
beyond
the
grove
of
mango
and
tamarind
trees
lay
the
stone
reservoir
of
surat
it
was
almost
a
mile
in
circumference
and
he
had
chosen
its
far
bank
as
campground
for
his
rajput
guard
accommodations
in
surat
were
nonexistent
during
the
season
and
although
he
could
have
cleared
a
guest
house
with
a
single
name
prince
jadar
he
had
chosen
to
remain
inconspicuous
through
the
dark
bamboo
slats
of
the
gate
he
could
now
see
the
englishman
riding
toward
him
holding
his
arabian
mare
at
an
easy
pace
vasant
rao
studied
the
gait
carefully
he
had
learned
he
could
always
judge
the
character
of
a
man
by
observing
that
man
handling
of
a
mount
he
casually
stroked
his
moustache
and
judged
brian
hawksworth
the
englishman
is
unpracticed
yet
there
an
unmistakable
sense
of
command
about
him
not
unlike
the
control
the
prince
holds
over
a
horse
he
handles
the
mare
almost
without
her
knowing
it
forcing
discipline
onto
her
natural
gait
perhaps
our
treacherous
friend
mirza
nuruddin
was
right
perhaps
the
englishman
will
suit
our
requirements
vasant
rao
remembered
that
jadar
had
been
insistent
on
the
point
the
english
captain
must
be
a
man
of
character
and
nerve
or
he
must
never
reach
burhanpur
you
need
only
be
seen
providing
his
guard
as
you
depart
surat
if
he
weak
like
a
christian
he
will
not
serve
our
needs
the
times
ahead
will
be
difficult
enough
vasant
rao
told
himself
without
having
to
worry
about
the
englishman
the
prince
has
been
trapped
in
the
south
and
now
there
news
inayat
latif
and
his
troops
are
being
recalled
to
agra
from
bengal
the
queen
will
soon
have
at
her
right
hand
the
most
able
general
in
the
moghul
army
vasant
rao
turned
his
eyes
from
the
englishman
to
look
again
at
his
own
rajput
guard
and
his
pride
in
them
restored
his
spirit
only
rajputs
would
have
the
courage
to
one
day
face
the
numerically
superior
troops
of
inayat
latif
the
origin
of
the
warrior
clans
who
called
themselves
rajputs
sons
of
kings
was
lost
in
legend
they
had
appeared
mysteriously
in
western
india
over
half
a
millennium
before
the
arrival
of
the
moghuls
and
they
had
royalty
and
honor
in
their
blood
they
had
always
demanded
to
be
known
as
kshatriya
the
ancient
hindu
warrior
caste
the
men
and
women
of
the
warrior
kshatriya
clans
lived
and
died
by
the
sword
and
maintained
a
timeless
tradition
of
personal
honor
theirs
was
a
profession
of
arms
and
they
lived
by
rules
of
conduct
unvaried
since
india
epic
age
a
member
of
the
warrior
caste
must
never
turn
his
back
in
battle
must
never
strike
with
concealed
weapons
no
warrior
could
strike
a
foe
who
was
fleeing
who
asked
for
mercy
whose
own
sword
was
broken
who
slept
who
had
lost
his
armor
who
was
merely
an
onlooker
who
was
facing
another
foe
surrender
was
unthinkable
a
rajput
defeated
in
battle
need
not
return
home
since
his
wife
would
turn
him
out
in
dishonor
for
not
having
given
his
life
but
if
a
rajput
perished
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
the
highest
honor
his
wife
would
proudly
follow
him
in
death
joining
his
body
on
the
funeral
pyre
and
many
times
in
centuries
past
rajput
women
themselves
had
taken
up
swords
to
defend
the
honor
of
their
clain
when
they
had
no
external
foes
the
rajput
clans
warred
among
themselves
since
they
knew
no
other
life
for
convenience
each
clan
decreed
its
immediate
neighboring
clans
its
enemies
and
an
elaborate
code
was
devised
to
justify
war
over
even
the
smallest
slight
their
martial
skills
were
never
allowed
to
gather
rust
even
if
the
cost
was
perpetual
slaughter
of
each
other
though
they
were
divided
among
themselves
the
rajput
clans
had
for
centuries
defended
their
lands
from
the
muslim
invaders
of
india
only
with
the
coming
of
the
great
moghul
genius
akman
was
there
a
muslim
ruler
with
the
wisdom
to
understand
the
rajputs
could
be
more
valuable
as
allies
than
as
foes
he
abandoned
attempts
to
subdue
them
instead
making
them
partners
in
his
empire
he
married
rajput
princesses
and
he
used
rajput
fighting
prowess
to
extend
moghul
control
south
and
west
in
india
the
men
with
vasant
rao
were
the
elite
of
the
dominant
chauhan
clan
and
all
claimed
descent
from
royal
blood
they
held
strong
loyalties
powerful
beliefs
and
absolutely
no
fear
of
what
lay
beyond
death
they
also
were
men
from
the
northwest
mountains
of
india
who
had
never
before
seen
surat
never
before
seen
the
sea
never
before
seen
a
but
vasant
rao
had
seen
when
he
had
stood
by
the
side
of
prince
jadar
in
agra
when
jesuit
fathers
had
been
called
to
dispute
with
muslim
mullahs
before
arangbar
he
had
seen
their
tight
assured
faces
and
heard
their
narrow
intolerant
views
could
this
any
different
already
he
had
witnessed
the
englishman
nerve
and
it
had
reminded
him
curiously
of
jadar
the
englishman
had
refused
to
come
to
their
camp
claiming
this
demeaned
his
office
of
ambassador
and
vasant
rao
representative
of
prince
jadar
had
refused
to
meet
the
englishman
inside
surat
finally
it
was
agreed
that
they
would
meet
at
the
wall
of
the
city
at
the
abidjan
gate
nimaste
ambassador
hawksworth
his
highness
prince
jadar
conveys
his
most
respectful
greetings
to
you
and
to
the
english
king
vasant
rao
turki
had
been
excellent
since
his
boyhood
and
he
tried
to
remember
the
phrases
mirza
nuruddin
had
coached
then
he
watched
through
the
bamboo
poles
of
the
gate
as
hawksworth
performed
a
lordly
salaam
from
horseback
the
gate
opened
i
am
pleased
to
offer
my
good
offices
to
you
and
your
king
vasant
rao
continued
in
the
name
of
his
highness
the
prince
it
is
his
pleasure
and
my
honor
to
provide
you
escort
for
your
journey
east
to
burhanpur
from
there
his
highness
will
arrange
a
further
escort
for
the
trip
north
to
agra
his
majesty
king
james
is
honored
by
his
highness
concern
hawksworth
examined
the
waiting
rajputs
his
apprehension
mounting
their
eyes
were
expressionless
beneath
their
leather
helmets
but
their
horses
pawed
impatiently
he
found
himself
wondering
if
mirza
nuruddin
had
contrived
to
provide
more
help
and
yet
another
surprise
but
my
route
is
not
yet
decided
although
i
grateful
for
his
offer
i
not
certain
traveling
east
on
the
burhanpur
road
is
best
his
excellency
mukarrab
khan
has
offered
to
provide
an
escort
if
i
take
the
udaipur
road
north
past
cambay
and
then
east
vasant
rao
examined
hawksworth
choosing
his
words
carefully
we
have
orders
to
remain
here
for
three
days
captain
and
then
to
return
to
burhanpur
it
would
be
considered
appropriate
by
the
prince
who
has
full
authority
to
administer
this
province
if
we
rode
escort
for
you
hawksworth
shifted
in
the
saddle
this
is
an
offer
it
an
ultimatum
is
his
highness
aware
i
have
with
me
a
large
sea
chest
it
will
require
a
cart
which
i
plan
to
hire
perhaps
the
delay
this
will
impose
would
inconvenience
you
and
your
men
since
you
surely
prefer
to
ride
swiftly
on
the
contrary
captain
we
will
have
with
us
a
small
convoy
of
supplies
lead
for
molding
shot
we
will
travel
at
a
pace
that
best
suits
us
all
your
chest
presents
no
difficulty
but
there
will
be
many
difficulties
he
told
himself
and
he
thought
again
about
mirza
nuruddin
and
the
terms
he
had
demanded
twenty
percent
interest
on
the
loan
and
only
a
hundred
and
eighty
days
to
repay
both
the
new
silver
coin
and
the
interest
but
why
vasant
rao
asked
himself
again
did
the
shahbandar
agree
to
the
plan
at
all
is
this
mirza
nuruddin
final
wager
that
jadar
will
win
will
three
days
be
sufficient
for
your
preparations
captain
hawksworth
it
will
if
i
decide
to
use
the
burhanpur
road
hawksworth
wondered
how
long
he
could
taunt
the
raput
perhaps
i
should
tell
you
something
about
travel
in
india
ambassador
there
are
as
you
say
two
possible
routes
between
surat
and
agra
both
present
certain
risks
the
northern
route
through
udaipur
and
rajputana
is
at
first
appearance
faster
since
the
roads
are
drier
and
the
rivers
there
have
already
subsided
from
the
monsoon
but
it
is
not
a
part
of
india
where
travelers
are
always
welcomed
by
the
local
rajput
clans
you
may
well
find
yourself
in
the
middle
of
a
local
war
or
the
reluctant
guest
of
a
petty
raja
who
judges
you
worth
a
ransom
on
the
other
hand
if
you
travel
east
through
burhanpur
you
may
find
that
some
rivers
are
still
heavy
from
the
monsoon
at
least
for
another
month
but
the
clans
there
are
loyal
to
prince
jadar
and
only
near
chopda
halfway
to
burhanpur
will
you
encounter
any
local
brigands
theirs
however
is
an
honorable
profession
and
they
are
always
willing
to
accept
bribes
in
return
for
safe
passage
we
ordinarily
do
not
kill
them
though
we
easily
could
since
petty
robbery
they
view
it
as
a
toll
is
their
livelihood
and
their
tradition
they
are
weak
and
they
make
weak
demands
such
is
not
true
of
the
rajas
in
rajputana
the
choice
is
yours
but
if
you
value
your
goods
and
your
life
you
will
join
us
as
we
make
our
way
east
to
burhanpur
hawksworth
studied
the
bearded
rajput
guards
as
vasant
rao
spoke
i
either
a
captive
of
the
prince
or
of
mukarrab
khan
regardless
of
what
i
do
which
one
wants
me
dead
more
my
frigate
sails
tomorrow
i
can
leave
the
following
day
good
it
agreed
then
our
convoy
will
leave
in
three
days
it
will
be
my
pleasure
to
travel
with
you
captain
hawksworth
your
reputation
has
already
reached
his
highness
we
will
meet
you
here
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
i
believe
that
your
hour
of
nine
in
the
morning
he
smiled
with
a
warmth
that
was
almost
genuine
you
should
consider
yourself
fortunate
few
have
ever
traveled
inland
you
will
find
the
interior
far
different
from
surat
until
then
he
bowed
lightly
and
snapped
a
command
to
the
waiting
horsemen
in
moments
they
were
lost
among
the
trees
this
evening
must
be
a
time
of
farewell
for
us
both
captain
hawksworth
you
know
the
hindus
believe
life
and
death
are
an
endless
cycle
that
dooms
them
to
repeat
their
miserable
existence
over
and
over
again
i
myself
prefer
to
think
that
this
one
life
is
itself
cyclical
ever
renewing
what
was
new
exciting
yesterday
is
today
tedious
and
tiresome
so
tomorrow
brings
us
both
rebirth
for
you
it
is
agra
for
me
goa
but
i
expect
to
see
surat
again
as
no
doubt
do
you
who
knows
when
our
paths
will
cross
once
more
mukarrab
khan
watched
as
a
eunuch
shoved
wide
the
door
leading
onto
the
torchlit
garden
you
have
been
a
most
gracious
visitor
tolerating
with
exemplary
forbearance
my
unworthy
hospitality
tonight
perhaps
you
will
endure
one
last
evening
of
my
company
even
if
i
have
little
else
left
to
offer
the
courtyard
was
a
confused
jumble
of
packing
cases
and
household
goods
servants
were
everywhere
wrapping
and
crating
rolled
carpets
bolsters
furniture
vases
and
women
clothing
elephants
stood
near
the
back
of
the
courtyard
howdahs
on
their
backs
waiting
to
be
loaded
goods
would
be
transferred
to
barks
for
the
trip
downriver
to
the
bar
where
they
would
be
loaded
aboard
a
waiting
portuguese
frigate
my
dining
hall
has
been
dismantled
its
carpet
rolled
we
have
no
choice
but
to
dine
this
evening
in
the
open
air
like
soldiers
on
the
march
hawksworth
was
no
longer
hearing
mukarrab
khan
he
was
staring
past
him
through
the
smoke
not
quite
believing
what
he
saw
but
it
was
all
too
real
standing
in
the
corner
of
the
courtyard
were
two
europeans
in
black
cassocks
portuguese
jesuits
mukarrab
khan
noticed
hawksworth
diplomatic
smile
suddenly
freeze
on
his
face
and
turned
to
follow
his
gaze
ah
i
must
introduce
you
you
do
understand
the
portuguese
language
captain
enough
i
should
have
thought
so
i
personally
find
it
abominable
and
refuse
to
study
it
but
both
the
fathers
here
have
studied
persian
in
goa
and
i
think
one
of
them
knows
a
bit
of
turki
from
his
time
in
agra
what
are
they
doing
here
hawksworth
tried
to
maintain
his
composure
they
returned
to
surat
just
today
from
goa
where
they
been
these
past
few
weeks
i
understand
they
en
route
to
the
jesuit
mission
in
lahore
a
city
in
the
punjab
well
to
the
north
of
agra
they
specifically
asked
to
meet
you
he
laughed
they
carrying
no
cannon
captain
and
i
assumed
you
had
no
objection
you
assumed
wrong
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
a
jesuit
you
meet
jesuits
enough
in
agra
captain
at
the
moghul
court
consider
this
evening
a
foretaste
mukarrab
khan
tried
to
smile
politely
but
there
was
a
strained
look
in
his
eyes
and
he
fingered
his
jeweled
ring
uncomfortably
you
would
favor
me
by
speaking
to
them
the
two
europeans
were
now
moving
toward
them
working
their
way
through
the
swarm
of
servants
and
crates
in
the
courtyard
the
studded
crucifixes
they
wore
against
their
black
cassocks
seemed
to
shoot
red
sparks
into
the
evening
air
mukarrab
khan
urged
hawksworth
forward
apprehensively
may
i
have
the
pleasure
to
present
ambassador
brian
hawksworth
who
represents
his
majesty
king
james
of
england
and
is
also
i
believe
an
official
of
england
east
india
company
and
to
you
ambassador
i
have
the
honor
to
introduce
father
alvarez
sarmento
superior
for
the
society
of
jesus
mission
in
lahore
and
father
francisco
da
silva
hawksworth
nodded
lightly
and
examined
them
although
sarmento
was
aged
his
face
remained
strong
and
purposeful
with
hard
cheeks
and
eyes
that
might
burn
through
marble
the
younger
priest
could
not
have
been
more
different
his
ruddy
neck
bulged
from
the
tight
collar
of
his
cassock
and
his
eyes
shifted
uncomfortably
behind
his
puffed
cheeks
hawksworth
wondered
absently
how
long
his
bloat
too
much
capon
and
port
wine
would
last
if
mackintosh
had
him
on
the
third
watch
for
a
month
you
are
a
celebrated
man
captain
hawksworth
father
sarmento
spoke
in
flawless
turki
but
his
voice
was
like
ice
there
is
much
talk
of
you
in
goa
the
new
viceroy
himself
requested
that
we
meet
you
and
convey
a
message
his
last
message
was
to
order
an
unlawful
attack
on
my
merchantmen
i
think
he
still
remembers
my
reply
is
he
now
offering
to
abide
by
the
treaty
your
spanish
king
signed
with
king
james
that
treaty
has
no
force
in
asia
captain
his
excellency
has
asked
us
to
inform
you
that
your
mission
to
agra
will
not
succeed
our
fathers
have
already
informed
the
moghul
that
england
is
a
lawless
nation
living
outside
the
grace
of
the
church
perhaps
you
are
unaware
of
the
esteem
he
now
holds
for
our
agra
mission
we
have
a
church
there
now
and
through
it
we
have
led
many
moors
to
god
we
have
refuted
the
islamic
mullahs
in
his
majesty
very
presence
and
shown
him
the
falsity
of
their
prophet
and
his
laws
indeed
it
is
only
because
of
the
esteem
we
have
earned
that
he
now
sends
an
ambassador
to
the
portuguese
viceroy
before
hawksworth
could
respond
father
sarmento
suddenly
reached
out
and
touched
his
arm
imploringly
captain
let
me
speak
now
not
for
the
viceroy
but
for
the
holy
church
hawksworth
realized
with
a
shock
that
he
was
speaking
english
do
you
understand
the
importance
of
god
work
in
this
sea
of
damned
souls
for
decades
we
have
toiled
in
this
vineyard
teaching
the
grace
of
god
and
his
holy
church
and
now
at
last
our
prayers
are
near
to
answer
when
arangbar
became
moghul
our
third
mission
had
already
been
here
for
ten
long
fruitless
years
we
strove
to
teach
the
grace
of
god
to
his
father
akman
but
his
damnation
was
he
could
never
accept
a
single
true
church
he
would
harken
to
a
heathen
fakir
as
readily
as
to
a
disciple
of
god
at
first
arangbar
seemed
like
him
save
his
failing
was
not
ecumenicity
it
was
indifference
and
suspicion
now
after
years
of
ignominy
we
have
secured
his
trust
and
with
that
trust
will
soon
come
his
soul
sarmento
paused
to
cross
himself
when
at
last
a
christian
holds
the
throne
of
india
there
will
be
rejoicing
at
the
throne
of
heaven
you
may
choose
to
live
outside
the
mystery
of
the
most
holy
sacrament
my
son
but
surely
you
would
not
wish
to
undo
god
great
work
i
implore
you
not
to
go
before
the
moghul
now
not
to
sow
unrest
in
his
believing
mind
with
stories
of
the
quarrels
and
hatreds
of
europe
england
was
once
in
the
bosom
of
the
holy
church
until
your
heretic
king
henry
and
england
had
returned
again
before
your
last
heretic
queen
led
you
once
more
to
damnation
know
the
church
always
stands
with
open
heart
to
receive
you
or
any
apostate
lutheran
who
wishes
to
repent
and
save
his
immortal
soul
i
see
now
why
jesuits
are
made
diplomats
is
your
concern
the
loss
of
the
moghul
soul
or
the
loss
of
his
trade
revenues
in
goa
hawksworth
deliberately
answered
in
turki
tell
your
pope
to
stop
trying
to
meddle
in
england
politics
and
tell
your
viceroy
to
honor
our
treaty
and
there
be
no
between
us
here
will
you
believe
my
word
sworn
before
god
that
i
have
told
his
excellency
that
very
thing
that
this
new
war
could
destroy
our
years
of
work
and
prayer
sarmento
still
spoke
in
english
but
he
is
a
man
with
a
personal
vendetta
toward
the
english
it
is
our
great
tragedy
the
viceroy
of
goa
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
is
a
man
nourished
by
hatred
may
god
forgive
him
hawksworth
stood
speechless
as
father
sarmento
crossed
himself
what
did
you
say
his
name
was
miguel
vaijantes
he
was
in
goa
as
a
young
captain
and
now
he
has
returned
as
viceroy
we
must
endure
him
for
three
more
years
the
antichrist
himself
could
not
have
made
our
cup
more
bitter
could
not
have
given
us
a
greater
test
of
our
christian
love
do
you
understand
now
why
i
beg
you
in
god
name
to
halt
this
war
between
us
hawksworth
felt
suddenly
numb
he
stumbled
past
the
aged
priest
and
blindly
stared
into
the
torchlit
courtyard
trying
to
remember
precisely
what
roger
symmes
had
said
that
day
so
many
years
ago
in
the
offices
of
the
levant
company
one
of
the
few
things
he
had
never
forgotten
from
symmes
monologue
of
hallucinations
and
dreams
was
the
name
miguel
vaijantes
hawksworth
slowly
turned
to
face
father
sarmento
and
switched
to
english
i
will
promise
you
this
father
if
i
reach
agra
i
will
never
speak
of
popery
unless
asked
it
honestly
does
interest
me
i
here
on
a
mission
not
a
crusade
and
in
return
i
would
ask
one
favor
of
you
i
would
like
you
to
send
a
message
to
miguel
vaijantes
tell
him
that
twenty
years
ago
in
goa
he
once
ordered
the
death
of
an
english
captain
named
hawksworth
on
the
tell
him
the
crash
of
shattering
glass
from
the
hallway
of
the
palace
severed
the
air
between
them
then
the
heavy
bronze
door
swung
wide
and
shirin
emerged
grasping
the
broken
base
of
a
chinese
vase
her
eyes
blazed
and
her
disheveled
hair
streamed
out
behind
her
hawksworth
thought
he
saw
a
stain
on
one
cheek
where
a
tear
had
trailed
but
now
that
trail
was
dry
she
strode
directly
to
mukarrab
khan
and
dashed
the
remainder
of
the
vase
at
his
feet
where
it
shattered
to
powder
on
the
marble
tiles
of
the
veranda
that
is
my
gift
to
the
queen
you
may
send
it
with
a
message
in
your
next
dispatch
tell
her
that
i
too
am
persian
that
i
too
know
the
name
of
my
father
father
of
his
father
father
of
his
father
father
for
ten
generations
but
unlike
her
i
was
born
in
india
and
it
is
in
india
that
i
will
stay
she
can
banish
me
to
the
remotest
village
of
the
punjab
but
she
will
never
send
me
to
goa
to
live
among
unwashed
portuguese
never
she
does
not
have
the
power
and
if
you
were
a
man
you
would
divorce
me
here
tonight
for
all
to
see
and
i
will
return
to
my
father
or
go
where
i
wish
or
you
may
kill
me
as
you
have
already
tried
to
do
but
you
must
decide
mukarrab
khan
face
was
lost
in
shock
the
courtyard
stood
lifeless
caught
in
a
silence
more
powerful
than
any
hawksworth
had
ever
known
he
looked
in
confusion
at
father
sarmento
and
the
old
jesuit
quietly
whispered
a
translation
of
the
persian
his
own
eyes
wide
in
disbelief
never
before
had
he
seen
a
muslim
woman
defy
her
husband
publicly
the
humiliation
was
unthinkable
mukarrab
khan
had
no
power
to
order
her
death
he
had
no
choice
but
to
divorce
her
as
she
demanded
but
everyone
knew
why
she
was
his
wife
what
would
a
divorce
mean
you
will
proceed
to
goa
as
my
wife
or
you
will
spend
the
rest
of
your
days
and
what
little
remains
of
your
fading
beauty
as
a
girl
at
the
port
your
price
will
be
one
copper
i
will
order
it
in
the
morning
his
majesty
will
know
of
it
within
a
week
i
have
friends
enough
in
agra
as
do
i
and
mine
have
the
power
to
act
then
divorce
me
mukarrab
khan
paused
painfully
then
glanced
down
and
absently
whisked
a
fleck
of
lint
from
his
brocade
sleeve
which
form
do
you
wish
an
audible
gasp
passed
through
the
servants
and
not
one
breathed
as
they
waited
for
the
answer
there
were
three
forms
of
divorce
for
muslims
the
first
called
a
revocable
divorce
was
performed
when
a
man
said
i
have
divorced
you
only
once
he
had
three
months
to
reconsider
and
reconcile
before
it
became
final
the
second
form
called
irrevocable
required
the
phrase
be
repeated
twice
after
which
she
could
only
become
his
wife
again
through
a
second
marriage
ceremony
the
third
absolute
required
three
repetitions
of
the
phrase
and
became
effective
the
day
her
next
reproductive
cycle
ended
there
could
be
no
remarriage
unless
she
had
in
the
interim
been
married
to
another
absolute
do
you
i
do
then
by
law
you
must
return
the
entire
marriage
settlement
you
took
it
from
me
and
squandered
it
long
ago
on
and
pretty
boys
what
is
left
to
return
then
it
is
done
hawksworth
watched
in
disbelief
as
mukarrab
khan
repeated
three
times
the
arabic
phrase
from
the
quran
that
cast
her
out
the
two
jesuits
also
stood
silently
their
faces
horrified
shirin
listened
impassively
as
his
voice
echoed
across
the
stunned
courtyard
then
without
a
word
she
ripped
the
strands
of
pearls
from
her
neck
and
threw
them
at
his
feet
before
mukarrab
khan
could
speak
again
she
had
turned
and
disappeared
through
the
doorway
of
the
palace
in
the
eyes
of
god
excellency
you
will
always
be
man
and
wife
father
sarmento
broke
the
silence
what
he
has
joined
man
can
not
rend
a
look
of
great
weariness
seemed
to
flood
mukarrab
khan
face
as
he
groped
to
find
the
facade
of
calm
that
protected
him
then
with
an
almost
visible
act
of
will
it
came
again
perhaps
you
understand
now
father
why
the
prophet
laws
grant
us
more
than
one
wife
allah
allows
for
certain
mistakes
he
forced
a
smile
then
whirled
on
a
eunuch
will
the
packing
be
finished
by
morning
as
ordered
khan
sahib
the
eunuch
snapped
to
formality
then
see
dinner
is
served
my
guests
or
put
my
kitchen
to
the
lash
he
turned
back
to
hawksworth
i
told
you
met
her
once
ambassador
i
trust
she
was
more
pleasant
then
merely
by
accident
excellency
while
i
was
at
the
in
the
garden
she
does
very
little
by
accident
you
should
mark
her
well
your
counsel
is
always
welcome
excellency
hawksworth
felt
his
pulse
surge
what
will
she
do
now
i
think
she
will
have
all
her
wishes
granted
he
turned
wearily
toward
the
marble
columns
of
the
veranda
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
must
leave
you
now
for
a
while
you
understand
i
have
further
dispatches
to
prepare
he
turned
and
was
gone
after
a
moment
pause
the
despairing
jesuits
trailed
after
and
suddenly
the
courtyard
seemed
empty
the
waves
curled
gently
against
the
shore
breaking
iridescent
over
the
staves
of
a
keg
before
him
the
sea
spread
wide
and
empty
only
a
single
sail
broke
the
horizon
his
mare
pawed
impatiently
but
hawksworth
could
not
bring
himself
to
turn
her
back
toward
the
road
not
yet
only
when
the
sail
white
had
blended
with
the
sea
did
he
rein
her
around
and
with
one
last
glance
at
the
empty
blue
give
her
the
spur
he
rode
briskly
past
the
nodding
palms
along
the
shore
then
turned
inland
toward
surat
through
villages
of
roofed
houses
on
low
stilts
women
watched
from
the
wide
porches
sewing
nursing
infants
after
a
time
he
no
longer
saw
them
no
longer
urged
the
mare
his
thoughts
were
filled
with
images
from
the
tumultuous
evening
past
he
had
paced
the
vacant
rooms
of
the
palace
till
the
early
hours
of
morning
his
mind
in
turmoil
sleep
was
never
a
possibility
when
the
courtyard
at
last
grew
still
he
had
slipped
back
into
the
garden
wanting
its
openness
the
feel
of
its
order
in
the
moonlight
it
lay
deserted
and
as
he
strolled
alongside
the
bubbling
fountain
he
felt
himself
even
more
lost
in
this
alien
place
this
alien
land
the
pilot
karim
had
been
right
india
had
already
unsettled
him
more
than
he
thought
he
could
bear
in
time
he
found
himself
wandering
once
more
through
the
orchard
amid
the
wistful
calls
of
night
birds
the
trees
formed
a
roof
of
leafy
shadows
cold
and
joyless
as
the
moon
above
even
then
all
he
could
see
was
shirin
poised
defiant
in
the
stark
torchlight
taunting
the
queen
she
had
offered
herself
up
to
almost
certain
death
for
reasons
he
scarcely
comprehended
before
he
fully
realized
where
he
was
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
observatory
a
tiny
blinking
owl
perched
atop
the
staircase
studying
him
critically
as
he
approached
around
him
the
marble
instruments
glistened
like
silver
while
ahead
stood
the
stone
hut
forlorn
now
more
ramshackle
than
he
had
ever
remembered
more
abandoned
he
reflected
sadly
that
it
probably
would
soon
be
forgotten
entirely
who
would
ever
come
here
again
the
door
of
the
hut
was
sealed
tightly
and
for
a
time
he
stood
simply
looking
at
it
trying
to
recall
all
that
had
passed
inside
finally
he
reached
with
a
determined
hand
and
pulled
it
wide
shirin
stared
up
from
the
table
in
shock
grabbing
the
lamp
as
though
to
extinguish
it
then
she
recognized
him
in
the
flickering
light
why
why
are
you
here
before
he
could
answer
she
moved
in
front
of
the
table
masking
it
from
his
view
you
should
not
have
come
if
you
seen
as
his
own
surprise
passed
he
felt
himself
suddenly
wanting
to
take
her
in
his
arms
what
does
it
matter
now
you
divorced
the
words
filled
him
with
momentary
exhilaration
till
he
remembered
the
rest
you
also
in
danger
whether
i
seen
or
not
that
my
concern
what
are
you
planning
to
do
leave
but
i
still
have
friends
he
reached
out
and
took
the
lamp
from
her
to
feel
the
touch
of
her
hand
it
was
soft
and
warm
will
i
ever
see
you
again
who
knows
what
will
happen
now
the
wildness
in
her
eyes
was
beginning
to
gentle
she
moved
back
from
the
table
and
dropped
into
a
chair
he
realized
it
was
the
same
chair
she
had
sat
in
when
telling
him
about
the
queen
on
the
table
before
her
were
piles
of
papers
tied
into
small
neat
bundles
she
examined
him
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
then
reached
to
brush
the
hair
back
from
her
eyes
did
you
come
here
just
to
see
me
not
really
he
stopped
then
laughed
i
think
maybe
i
did
i
think
i
somehow
knew
you
would
be
here
without
realizing
i
knew
been
thinking
about
you
all
night
why
her
voice
quickened
just
enough
for
him
to
notice
i
not
sure
i
do
know
i
very
worried
about
what
may
happen
to
you
no
one
else
seems
to
be
no
one
will
talk
to
me
now
not
even
the
servants
suddenly
i
do
exist
her
eyes
softened
thank
you
thank
you
for
coming
it
means
you
not
afraid
i
glad
why
do
you
care
whether
i
came
or
not
he
asked
almost
before
realizing
what
he
was
saying
she
hesitated
and
unconsciously
ran
her
glance
down
his
frame
to
see
you
one
more
time
he
thought
he
saw
something
enter
her
eyes
rising
up
unbidden
do
you
realize
you
become
very
special
for
me
tell
me
he
studied
her
eyes
in
the
lamplight
watching
them
soften
even
more
you
not
like
anyone
i
ever
known
you
part
of
something
that
very
strange
to
me
i
sometimes
find
myself
dreaming
of
you
you
you
very
powerful
something
about
you
she
caught
herself
then
laughed
but
maybe
it
not
really
you
i
dream
about
at
all
maybe
it
what
you
are
what
do
you
mean
you
a
man
from
the
west
there
a
strength
about
you
i
fully
understand
he
watched
her
holding
herself
in
check
go
on
maybe
it
partly
the
way
you
touch
and
master
the
things
around
you
she
looked
at
him
directly
let
me
try
to
explain
what
i
mean
for
most
people
in
india
the
world
that
matters
most
is
the
world
within
we
explore
the
seas
inside
our
own
mind
and
so
we
wait
we
wait
for
the
world
outside
to
be
brought
to
us
but
for
you
the
inner
world
seems
secondary
she
laughed
again
and
now
her
voice
was
controlled
and
even
perhaps
i
not
explaining
it
well
let
me
try
again
do
you
remember
the
first
thing
you
did
on
your
very
first
morning
in
the
palace
i
walked
out
here
to
the
observatory
but
why
did
you
because
i
a
seaman
and
i
thought
no
that
only
partly
the
reason
she
smiled
i
think
you
came
to
see
it
because
it
belongs
to
the
world
of
things
like
a
good
european
you
felt
you
must
first
and
always
be
the
master
of
things
of
ships
of
guns
even
of
the
stars
maybe
that
why
i
find
you
so
strong
she
paused
then
reached
out
and
touched
his
hand
the
gesture
had
been
impulsive
and
when
she
realized
what
she
done
she
moved
to
pull
it
back
then
stopped
herself
he
looked
at
her
in
the
lamplight
then
gently
placed
his
other
hand
over
hers
and
held
it
firm
then
let
me
tell
you
something
i
find
you
just
as
hard
to
understand
i
find
myself
drawn
to
something
about
you
and
it
troubles
me
why
should
it
trouble
you
because
i
do
know
who
you
are
what
you
are
even
what
doing
or
why
you
risked
everything
for
principles
that
are
completely
outside
me
he
looked
into
her
eyes
trying
to
find
words
and
regardless
of
what
you
say
i
think
you
somehow
know
everything
there
is
to
know
about
me
i
do
even
have
to
tell
you
things
pass
between
a
man
and
woman
that
go
beyond
words
not
everything
has
to
be
said
she
shifted
her
gaze
away
you
had
great
sadness
in
your
life
and
i
think
it
killed
some
part
of
you
you
no
longer
allow
yourself
to
trust
or
to
love
i
had
some
bad
experiences
with
trust
but
do
let
it
die
her
eyes
met
his
it
the
thing
most
worthwhile
he
looked
at
her
a
long
moment
feeling
the
tenderness
beneath
her
strength
and
he
knew
he
wanted
her
more
than
anything
before
he
thought
he
had
slipped
his
arm
around
her
waist
and
drawn
her
up
to
him
he
later
remembered
his
amazement
at
her
softness
her
warmth
as
he
pulled
her
body
against
his
own
before
she
could
speak
he
had
kissed
her
bringing
her
mouth
full
to
his
lips
he
had
thought
for
an
instant
she
would
resist
and
he
meant
to
draw
her
closer
only
then
did
he
realize
it
was
she
who
had
come
to
him
pressing
her
body
against
his
they
clung
together
in
the
lamplight
neither
wanting
the
moment
to
end
at
last
with
an
act
of
will
she
pulled
herself
away
no
her
breath
was
coming
almost
faster
than
his
own
impossible
nothing
impossible
he
suddenly
knew
with
an
absolute
certainty
that
he
had
to
make
her
his
own
come
with
me
to
agra
together
do
say
it
she
stopped
his
lips
with
her
finger
not
yet
she
glanced
at
the
papers
on
the
table
then
reached
for
his
hand
bringing
it
to
her
moist
cheek
not
yet
you
leaving
so
am
i
we
leave
together
i
ca
she
was
slipping
from
him
he
felt
it
i
think
of
you
when
you
in
agra
and
when
we
ready
we
find
each
other
i
promise
it
before
he
knew
she
had
turned
and
gathered
the
bundles
when
she
reached
for
the
lamp
suddenly
her
hand
stopped
let
leave
it
she
looked
toward
him
still
burning
then
she
reached
out
and
brushed
his
lips
with
her
fingertips
one
last
time
he
watched
in
dismay
as
she
passed
on
through
the
doorway
in
moments
she
was
lost
among
the
shadows
of
the
orchard
book
three
the
road
chapter
thirteen
east
along
the
tapti
river
valley
the
land
was
a
verdant
paradise
a
patchwork
of
mango
and
pipal
groves
and
freshly
turned
dark
earth
by
the
fields
of
cotton
corn
and
sugarcane
were
in
harvest
and
in
the
lowlands
paired
buffalo
strained
to
turn
the
crusted
mud
to
readiness
for
broadcast
sowing
the
grain
crops
of
autumn
millet
wheat
and
barley
the
roads
had
again
grown
passable
and
now
they
were
a
continual
procession
as
caravans
of
bullock
carts
inched
ponderously
west
toward
the
shipping
port
of
surat
the
distance
from
surat
to
burhanpur
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
in
dry
weather
it
could
be
traversed
in
just
over
a
fortnight
vasant
rao
had
hired
fifty
carts
to
transport
the
sealed
bundles
which
he
said
were
lead
to
burhanpur
swelling
his
entourage
of
forty
raput
horsemen
by
fifty
drivers
and
bullock
teams
he
had
also
hired
five
additional
carts
to
carry
provisions
brian
hawksworth
had
contracted
for
his
own
cart
and
driver
negotiating
a
price
of
twenty
rupees
for
cartage
of
his
belongings
all
the
way
from
surat
to
agra
he
was
amused
to
reflect
that
the
chest
containing
king
james
gifts
for
the
moghul
of
india
traveled
lashed
to
the
bed
of
a
ramshackle
cart
originally
intended
for
hay
the
caravan
had
been
scheduled
to
depart
early
on
a
saturday
morning
but
the
drivers
had
suddenly
refused
to
budge
until
the
following
day
hawksworth
had
confronted
his
driver
nayka
a
man
with
the
spindly
limbs
of
the
underfed
and
demanded
to
know
why
nayka
had
twisted
his
head
deferentially
riveting
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
explained
in
halting
turki
today
is
saturday
captain
sahib
saturdays
and
tuesdays
are
sacred
to
the
goddess
devi
the
divine
mother
journeys
begun
on
those
days
always
meet
disaster
bandits
tigers
roads
a
mussalman
once
made
my
cousin
bring
a
cart
of
indigo
to
surat
from
a
village
down
the
river
on
a
tuesday
and
a
bridge
broke
under
his
load
both
of
his
bullocks
were
drowned
it
was
on
sunday
when
the
caravan
finally
pulled
out
from
the
water
tank
at
surat
abidjan
gate
by
nightfall
they
had
traveled
three
reaching
the
outskirts
of
the
village
of
cossaria
the
next
day
they
made
twelve
to
reach
the
town
of
karod
a
strategic
fort
on
the
tapti
dominated
by
a
hilltop
castle
that
garrisoned
two
hundred
rajput
soldiers
the
next
three
days
their
camp
stages
had
been
the
towns
of
viara
corka
and
the
large
garrison
city
of
narayanpur
on
the
insistence
of
mirza
nuruddin
hawksworth
had
carried
only
a
minimal
amount
of
money
with
him
instead
he
had
adopted
the
practice
of
indian
merchants
leaving
a
chest
of
silver
in
surat
and
receiving
a
letter
of
credit
which
could
be
debited
for
cash
at
major
stops
along
the
road
to
agra
moneylenders
received
negotiable
notes
against
the
silver
deposit
which
would
be
paid
in
surat
at
percent
surcharge
thereby
allowing
travelers
along
the
roads
to
carry
cheques
instead
of
cash
hawksworth
found
himself
annoyed
that
vasant
rao
never
allowed
the
caravan
to
stop
inside
the
towns
where
traditional
indian
guest
houses
a
stone
floor
and
a
roof
were
available
free
for
travelers
instead
they
camped
each
evening
on
the
outskirts
while
a
few
rajputs
rode
in
to
the
town
bazaar
to
buy
fresh
vegetables
bricks
of
cow
dung
for
cooking
and
betel
leaves
for
the
drivers
the
evening
they
reached
narayanpur
the
governor
of
the
garrison
partab
shah
had
paid
a
surprise
visit
to
their
camp
bringing
his
own
troup
of
women
while
the
women
entertained
the
rajputs
with
an
evening
of
dance
and
intimacy
partab
shah
whispered
warnings
to
hawksworth
that
the
road
farther
east
was
no
longer
safe
now
that
civil
rule
in
the
deccan
was
teetering
the
governor
had
offered
to
provide
additional
troops
to
escort
the
english
ambassador
and
his
gifts
for
the
moghul
safely
through
the
district
to
the
governor
and
hawksworth
dismay
vasant
rao
had
politely
declined
it
had
been
well
after
midnight
when
the
governor
and
his
aides
rose
to
return
to
narayanpur
vasant
rao
had
insisted
that
the
women
be
sent
with
him
then
he
convened
the
rajputs
and
drivers
and
announced
that
they
would
assemble
the
caravan
two
hours
before
sunup
the
following
morning
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
they
would
try
to
reach
and
ford
the
tapti
before
nightfall
then
veer
northeast
for
burhanpur
hawksworth
thought
he
detected
a
trace
of
worry
in
vasant
rao
voice
for
the
first
time
they
were
well
underway
by
sunup
the
next
day
and
as
he
fought
off
sleep
in
the
rising
heat
hawksworth
reflected
on
what
he
had
seen
along
the
road
it
was
clear
the
larger
towns
were
collection
depots
for
the
surat
region
centers
where
grain
cotton
indigo
and
hemp
were
assembled
for
delivery
to
the
port
as
their
caravan
rumbled
through
town
after
town
hawksworth
began
to
find
them
merely
a
provincial
version
of
surat
equally
frenetic
and
their
bazaars
bustled
with
haggling
brokers
and
an
air
of
commerce
triumphant
after
a
time
he
began
to
find
them
more
wearisome
than
exotic
but
between
these
towns
lived
the
other
india
one
of
villages
unchanged
for
centuries
to
a
londoner
and
seaman
they
were
another
world
and
hawksworth
understood
almost
nothing
of
what
he
saw
several
times
he
had
started
to
ask
vasant
rao
some
question
about
a
village
but
the
time
never
seemed
right
the
rajput
was
constantly
occupied
with
the
progress
of
the
caravan
and
never
spoke
unless
he
was
giving
an
order
the
long
silence
of
the
road
had
gathered
between
them
until
it
was
almost
an
invisible
wall
for
no
apparent
reason
this
changed
suddenly
on
the
afternoon
after
narayanpur
as
the
caravan
rumbled
into
the
small
village
of
nimgul
and
began
working
its
way
along
the
single
road
through
the
town
vasant
rao
drew
his
mount
alongside
hawksworth
and
pointed
to
a
white
plaster
building
up
ahead
that
dominated
the
center
of
the
village
i
grew
to
manhood
in
a
village
such
as
this
captain
in
a
house
much
like
that
one
there
hawksworth
examined
the
house
and
then
the
village
around
it
spreading
away
on
all
sides
were
tumbledown
homes
of
sticks
and
clay
many
raised
on
stilts
to
keep
them
above
the
seasonal
mud
gaunt
naked
children
swarmed
about
the
few
remaining
trees
their
voices
piping
shrilly
at
play
while
elderly
men
lounged
on
the
porches
smoking
hookahs
most
of
the
men
seemed
to
be
in
the
fields
leaving
their
women
unsmiling
laborers
in
drab
length
wraps
a
large
marriage
ring
dangling
from
one
nostril
to
toil
in
the
midday
sun
combing
seeds
from
large
stacks
of
cotton
shelling
piles
of
corn
and
boiling
a
dense
brown
liquid
in
wide
iron
pans
vasant
rao
drew
up
his
horse
in
front
of
the
pans
and
spoke
rapidly
with
one
of
the
women
there
was
a
tinkle
of
her
heavy
silver
bracelets
as
she
bowed
to
him
then
turned
to
ask
a
turbaned
overseer
to
offer
them
two
clay
cups
of
the
liquid
vasant
rao
threw
the
man
a
small
coin
a
copper
and
passed
one
of
the
cups
to
hawksworth
it
was
viscous
and
sweeter
than
anything
he
had
ever
tasted
vasant
rao
savored
a
mouthful
then
discarded
the
cup
into
the
road
they
boiling
cane
juice
to
make
those
brown
blocks
of
sugar
you
see
in
the
bazaars
for
the
brahmin
landholders
to
sell
she
a
camar
a
low
caste
and
she
works
from
sunup
to
dusk
for
a
day
supply
of
fried
wheat
cakes
for
her
household
wages
risen
in
the
villages
since
i
was
a
boy
why
did
she
ask
the
overseer
to
bring
you
the
cup
because
i
a
rajput
vasant
rao
seemed
startled
by
the
question
i
would
pollute
my
caste
if
i
took
a
cup
from
the
hand
of
a
camar
if
a
rajput
or
a
brahmin
eats
food
that
been
handled
by
a
member
of
the
low
castes
he
may
be
obligated
to
undergo
ritual
purification
if
you
are
born
to
a
high
caste
captain
you
must
honor
its
obligations
hawksworth
studied
him
wondering
why
he
had
finally
decided
to
talk
security
had
been
unaccountably
tight
for
a
shipment
of
lead
vasant
rao
had
insisted
that
all
carts
be
kept
within
the
perimeter
of
the
camp
inside
the
circle
of
guards
no
one
neither
drivers
nor
guards
had
been
allowed
to
touch
the
contents
of
the
carts
sealed
packages
individually
wrapped
and
lashed
in
bricks
did
you
grow
up
around
here
hawksworth
tried
to
widen
the
opening
no
of
course
not
he
laughed
sharply
only
a
would
ask
that
i
was
born
in
the
foothills
of
the
himalayas
hundreds
of
north
of
agra
in
a
rajput
village
the
villages
in
the
surat
district
are
ruled
by
brahmins
are
rajput
villages
like
this
all
villages
are
more
or
less
the
same
captain
how
could
it
be
otherwise
they
all
hindu
this
is
the
real
india
my
friend
muslims
and
moghuls
and
now
christians
come
and
go
this
stays
the
same
these
villages
will
endure
long
after
the
marble
cities
of
the
moghuls
are
dust
that
why
i
feel
peace
here
knowing
this
can
not
be
destroyed
no
matter
who
rules
in
agra
hawksworth
looked
about
the
village
it
seemed
to
be
ruled
by
cattle
they
roamed
freely
arrogantly
secure
in
the
instinct
that
they
were
sacred
and
inviolable
naked
children
had
begun
to
swarm
after
the
carts
and
a
few
young
women
paused
to
cast
discreet
glances
at
the
handsome
rajput
horsemen
but
the
main
work
pressed
monotonously
forward
it
was
a
place
untouched
by
the
world
beyond
its
horizons
you
said
this
was
a
brahmin
village
are
all
the
men
here
priests
of
course
not
vasant
rao
grunted
a
laugh
and
gestured
toward
the
fields
beyond
who
would
do
the
work
there
must
be
the
other
castes
or
the
brahmins
would
starve
brahmins
and
rajputs
are
forbidden
by
the
laws
of
caste
from
working
the
land
i
meant
this
village
is
ruled
by
brahmins
although
i
guess
no
more
than
one
family
in
ten
is
high
caste
the
brick
and
plaster
homes
there
in
the
center
of
the
village
probably
belong
to
brahmins
the
villages
of
india
captain
hawksworth
are
not
ruled
by
the
ruled
by
the
high
castes
here
the
brahmins
in
other
villages
the
rajputs
these
together
with
some
merchants
called
banias
make
up
the
hindus
the
wearers
of
the
sacred
thread
of
the
twice
born
the
real
owners
and
rules
of
india
all
the
other
castes
exist
to
serve
them
i
thought
there
were
only
four
castes
hawksworth
remembered
that
mukarrab
khan
had
once
described
the
caste
system
of
the
hindus
with
obvious
muslim
disgust
there
are
four
castes
he
had
explained
each
striving
to
exploit
those
below
the
greatest
exploiters
called
themselves
brahmin
probably
aryan
invaders
who
had
arrived
thousands
of
years
past
and
now
proclaimed
themselves
preservers
of
tradition
that
tradition
which
they
invented
was
mainly
subjugation
of
all
the
others
next
came
the
kshatriya
the
warrior
caste
which
had
been
claimed
by
rajput
tribes
who
also
had
invaded
india
probably
well
after
the
brahmins
the
third
caste
also
high
was
called
vaisya
and
was
supposed
to
be
made
up
of
producers
of
foods
and
goods
now
it
was
the
caste
claimed
by
rich
grasping
hindu
merchants
below
all
these
were
the
sudra
who
were
in
effect
the
servants
and
laborers
for
the
powerful
high
castes
but
even
the
sudra
had
someone
to
exploit
for
beneath
them
were
the
untouchables
those
unfortunates
in
whose
veins
probably
ran
the
blood
of
the
original
inhabitants
of
india
the
untouchables
had
no
caste
the
part
that
annoyed
mukarrab
khan
the
most
was
that
hindus
regarded
all
muslims
as
part
of
the
mass
of
untouchables
the
four
main
castes
are
those
prescribed
in
the
order
of
the
the
ancient
aryan
scriptures
but
the
world
of
the
village
has
little
to
do
with
the
today
there
are
many
castes
vasant
rao
continued
reflecting
to
himself
how
he
loathed
most
brahmins
who
took
every
opportunity
to
claim
caste
superiority
over
rajputs
for
example
the
brahmins
here
probably
have
two
subcastes
one
for
the
priests
who
think
up
ceremonies
as
an
excuse
to
collect
money
and
the
other
for
the
landowners
most
of
whom
are
also
moneylenders
there
he
pointed
that
man
is
a
brahmin
hawksworth
saw
a
shirtless
man
standing
by
one
of
the
white
plaster
homes
he
wore
a
dingy
loincloth
beneath
his
enormous
belly
and
as
hawksworth
examined
him
he
noticed
a
strand
of
thread
that
circled
around
his
neck
and
under
his
left
arm
why
is
he
wearing
a
cord
around
his
shoulder
that
the
sacred
thread
of
the
high
castes
i
wear
one
myself
vasant
rao
opened
his
shirt
to
reveal
a
strand
of
three
colored
threads
woven
together
it
consecrated
and
given
to
boys
around
age
ten
at
a
very
important
ceremony
before
the
thread
ceremony
a
boy
has
no
caste
an
orthodox
brahmin
wo
even
eat
with
his
son
until
after
the
boy
thread
ceremony
hawksworth
examined
the
thread
it
was
the
first
time
he
noticed
it
what
about
the
men
who
do
wear
a
thread
they
the
middle
castes
the
ones
who
do
the
work
in
a
village
carpenters
potters
weavers
barbers
they
serve
the
high
castes
and
each
other
the
barber
shaves
the
potter
the
potter
makes
his
vessels
the
brahmins
here
probably
wo
sell
them
any
land
so
they
always
be
poor
that
why
the
middle
castes
live
in
houses
of
mud
and
thatch
instead
of
brick
and
below
them
are
the
unclean
castes
sweepers
servants
shoemakers
and
below
them
are
the
hawksworth
thought
me
what
the
hell
the
reason
for
all
this
it
worse
than
the
class
system
in
england
i
drink
with
any
man
high
or
low
i
have
and
i
usually
prefer
to
drink
with
the
low
that
may
explain
why
most
seem
so
confused
and
unhappy
caste
is
the
most
important
thing
in
life
vasant
rao
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
receding
village
it
the
reason
india
civilization
has
lasted
for
thousands
of
years
i
pity
your
misfortune
captain
hawksworth
not
to
have
been
born
a
hindu
perhaps
you
were
once
and
will
be
again
in
some
future
life
i
think
you
someday
be
reborn
a
kshatriya
a
member
of
the
warrior
caste
then
you
know
who
you
are
what
you
must
do
unlike
the
moghuls
and
the
other
muslims
who
have
no
caste
and
never
know
their
purpose
in
life
a
rajput
always
knows
as
they
rode
on
through
the
countryside
hawksworth
tried
to
understand
the
purpose
of
castes
its
absurdity
annoyed
him
mukarrab
khan
was
right
for
once
it
just
a
class
system
devised
by
the
highborn
to
keep
the
others
in
submission
but
why
do
they
all
seem
to
believe
in
it
why
do
the
lower
castes
just
tell
the
others
to
go
to
hell
as
they
neared
the
next
village
he
decided
to
try
to
guess
who
was
in
which
caste
but
the
central
road
in
the
village
was
deserted
instead
all
the
villagers
men
and
women
were
clustered
around
a
tall
brightly
painted
pole
that
had
been
erected
near
one
of
the
dingy
thatch
homes
vasant
rao
face
brightened
when
he
saw
the
pole
there
must
be
a
wedding
here
today
have
you
ever
seen
one
no
not
in
india
this
is
a
powerful
moment
captain
when
you
feel
the
force
of
the
life
spirit
vasant
rao
pointed
toward
a
pavilion
that
had
been
erected
next
to
the
marriage
pole
from
horseback
hawksworth
could
just
make
out
the
bride
and
groom
both
dressed
in
red
wraps
trimmed
in
silver
the
groom
wore
a
high
turban
on
top
of
which
were
ceremonial
decorations
and
the
bride
was
so
encrusted
with
precious
metals
she
might
have
been
a
size
ornament
her
hands
wrists
feet
ankles
and
her
head
were
all
adorned
with
elaborately
worked
silver
rings
bracelets
medallions
her
necklace
was
a
string
of
large
gold
coins
where
she
get
all
the
silver
and
gold
her
father
is
probably
a
big
landowner
those
ornaments
are
her
savings
and
part
of
her
dowry
look
all
the
women
wear
thick
bracelets
of
silver
on
their
ankles
there
much
gold
and
silver
in
india
captain
as
hawksworth
watched
a
brahmin
priest
his
forehead
streaked
with
white
clay
finished
lighting
a
fire
in
a
central
brazier
and
then
began
to
recite
the
priest
is
reciting
from
the
vedas
sanskrit
scriptures
thousands
of
years
old
vasant
rao
continued
as
they
watched
this
is
a
ritual
going
back
to
the
dawn
of
time
the
couple
began
repeating
the
priest
verses
their
faces
intent
and
solemn
they
taking
the
marriage
vows
now
there
are
seven
the
most
important
is
the
wife
vow
of
complete
obedience
to
her
husband
see
the
silver
knife
he
carries
that
to
symbolize
his
dominion
over
her
but
really
she
will
belong
to
his
entire
family
when
she
finally
comes
to
live
at
his
house
what
do
you
mean
by
these
things
take
time
to
begin
with
a
marriage
proposal
must
come
from
the
family
of
the
girl
as
she
approaches
womenhood
her
father
will
hire
a
marriage
broker
probably
the
village
barber
to
go
to
surrounding
villages
to
look
for
a
suitable
match
i
remember
when
i
was
young
and
they
used
to
come
to
my
village
vasant
rao
face
assumed
a
faraway
expression
i
did
want
to
marry
and
i
dreaded
seeing
them
but
unfortunately
i
was
a
good
catch
my
subcaste
is
high
and
i
had
many
sisters
which
meant
more
women
to
share
the
work
in
our
house
then
one
day
my
father
ordered
the
priest
to
cast
my
horoscope
and
i
knew
i
was
lost
a
broker
had
brought
an
inquiry
from
a
girl
who
had
a
compatible
horoscope
soon
after
the
engagement
ceremony
was
held
in
our
house
the
girl
was
not
there
of
course
i
did
see
her
until
three
years
later
when
we
finally
had
the
ceremony
you
see
here
the
bride
and
groom
were
standing
together
now
and
they
began
to
circle
the
fire
while
the
women
standing
nearby
sang
a
monotonous
repetitive
song
hawksworth
counted
seven
turns
of
the
fire
then
they
seated
themselves
and
the
priest
placed
a
red
dot
on
the
forehead
of
man
and
wife
they
feast
tonight
and
then
the
groom
will
return
to
his
village
vasant
rao
spurred
his
mount
to
catch
up
with
the
caravan
later
she
and
her
family
will
go
there
for
more
ceremonies
after
that
the
groom
may
not
see
her
again
for
several
years
until
the
day
her
father
decides
she
ready
for
the
the
consummation
of
the
marriage
i
did
see
my
bride
again
for
two
years
what
happened
then
she
came
to
my
village
for
a
few
days
and
stayed
in
the
quarters
the
men
and
women
sleep
apart
in
these
villages
and
i
had
to
go
there
and
try
to
find
her
cot
after
that
she
went
back
home
and
it
was
several
months
later
before
i
saw
her
again
then
she
came
back
for
a
longer
time
finally
she
moved
to
my
village
but
by
then
i
was
nineteen
and
soon
after
i
left
on
a
campaign
she
stayed
with
my
younger
brother
while
i
was
gone
and
when
i
returned
she
was
with
child
who
can
say
whether
it
was
mine
or
his
but
none
of
it
matters
for
she
died
in
childbirth
he
spurred
his
horse
past
the
line
of
carts
let
try
to
make
the
river
before
sundown
hawksworth
could
believe
what
he
had
heard
and
he
whipped
his
mount
to
catch
up
your
brother
kept
your
wife
while
you
were
away
of
course
i
do
know
how
it
is
here
but
in
the
part
of
india
where
i
was
born
brothers
normally
share
each
other
wives
i
used
to
go
to
my
older
brother
house
when
he
was
gone
and
visit
his
wife
she
expected
it
and
would
have
been
upset
if
i
had
come
to
her
vasant
rao
was
puzzled
by
hawksworth
surprise
do
brothers
share
one
another
wives
in
england
well
not
usually
i
mean
no
hell
no
it
damned
close
to
incest
the
truth
is
a
husband
would
have
grounds
to
call
out
a
man
he
caught
with
his
wife
and
especially
a
brother
him
out
captain
what
does
that
mean
a
duel
with
swords
or
maybe
pistols
vasant
rao
was
incredulous
but
what
if
a
man
goes
away
on
a
campaign
his
wife
will
grow
frustrated
hindus
believe
a
woman
has
seven
times
the
sexual
energy
of
a
man
she
would
start
meeting
other
men
in
the
village
if
a
man
have
a
brother
to
keep
her
satisfied
in
the
village
where
i
grew
up
if
a
man
and
woman
met
together
by
chance
in
the
forest
and
they
had
the
same
caste
we
all
assumed
they
would
make
the
most
of
the
opportunity
so
it
better
for
the
honor
of
the
family
if
your
brothers
care
for
your
wife
it
an
important
duty
for
brothers
and
besides
as
long
as
a
woman
attends
to
her
own
husband
needs
what
does
it
matter
if
his
brother
enjoys
her
also
hawksworth
found
himself
astonished
how
does
i
mean
what
about
this
brother
own
wife
what
does
she
think
about
all
this
if
her
husband
wants
to
visit
his
brothers
wives
what
should
she
care
it
normal
she
also
find
ways
to
meet
her
husband
brothers
for
the
same
purpose
women
married
to
brothers
often
try
to
send
each
other
away
on
errands
in
order
to
enjoy
the
other
husband
so
wives
have
no
reason
to
complain
in
fact
if
a
woman
returns
to
her
own
village
for
a
visit
she
will
probably
seek
out
some
of
the
men
she
knew
when
she
was
young
and
enjoy
them
since
her
husband
is
not
around
and
no
one
in
her
own
village
would
tell
him
hindus
in
the
villages
do
lock
away
their
women
the
way
the
muslims
do
captain
hawksworth
and
because
they
free
to
enjoy
whoever
they
wish
they
frustrated
and
unhappy
the
way
muslim
women
are
surely
your
england
is
an
advanced
country
where
women
have
the
same
freedom
hawksworth
puzzled
for
a
minute
before
trying
to
answer
the
truth
is
there
a
big
difference
between
what
said
and
what
done
with
chastity
praised
from
the
pulpits
and
whores
the
length
of
london
and
highborn
ladies
thronging
the
playhouses
ready
to
cuckold
their
husbands
with
any
cavalier
who
give
them
a
look
how
can
i
explain
it
i
guess
you
say
women
have
the
most
freedom
to
take
lovers
usually
young
gallants
or
soldiers
and
no
one
is
surprised
if
her
husband
makes
full
use
of
his
serving
wench
are
these
soldiers
and
serving
women
from
a
lower
caste
well
we
do
exactly
have
hawksworth
paused
for
a
moment
actually
i
guess
you
could
say
they
a
lower
in
a
way
vasant
reined
in
his
mount
and
inspected
hawksworth
for
a
moment
in
disgust
please
excuse
me
if
i
say
yours
must
be
a
very
immoral
country
captain
such
a
thing
would
never
happen
in
india
no
rajput
would
touch
the
body
of
a
low
caste
it
would
be
pollution
you
do
care
what
your
women
do
all
that
matters
is
who
they
do
it
with
hawksworth
suddenly
realized
he
found
it
all
too
absurd
to
believe
it
sounds
like
another
tale
of
the
indies
concocted
to
entertain
credulous
seamen
all
right
then
what
about
your
own
wife
did
she
have
other
men
besides
your
brothers
how
would
i
know
vasant
rao
waved
his
hand
dismissing
the
question
as
insignificant
i
suppose
it
possible
but
after
she
died
i
decided
i
had
enough
of
wives
and
women
i
took
a
vow
of
chastity
there
the
legend
of
a
god
named
hanumanji
who
took
on
the
flesh
of
a
monkey
and
who
gained
insuperable
strength
by
retaining
his
semen
it
made
him
invulnerable
vasant
rao
smiled
so
far
it
worked
for
me
as
well
but
to
protect
the
charm
i
eat
no
meat
and
drink
a
glass
of
opium
each
day
the
rajput
suddenly
spurred
his
mount
toward
the
head
of
the
caravan
the
sun
had
disappeared
behind
a
heavy
bank
of
storm
clouds
in
the
west
and
the
road
had
already
begun
to
darken
the
river
was
probably
still
another
hour
away
perhaps
two
hours
hawksworth
studied
vasant
rao
tall
commanding
form
sitting
erect
and
easy
in
the
saddle
sweet
jesus
he
thinks
he
invulnerable
because
he
avoids
women
and
drinks
opium
rajputs
are
even
madder
than
the
damned
turks
and
he
thinks
the
high
castes
rule
by
the
will
of
god
i
wonder
what
the
low
castes
think
hawksworth
puzzled
through
the
rajput
words
and
in
the
saddle
until
he
realized
they
were
finally
approaching
the
river
ahead
past
groves
of
mango
trees
lay
a
sandy
expanse
leading
down
toward
the
water
edge
as
they
approached
vasant
rao
sent
some
of
his
horsemen
to
scout
along
the
riverbank
in
both
directions
to
find
a
shallow
spot
for
crossing
the
caravan
followed
the
stream
for
half
a
then
halted
on
a
sandy
plain
that
sloped
gradually
down
toward
the
wide
stream
the
water
rippled
slightly
all
the
way
across
signifying
there
were
no
lurking
depths
to
swallow
a
cart
the
sun
was
dying
washing
a
veneer
of
gold
over
the
high
dark
clouds
threatening
in
the
east
the
smell
of
rain
hinted
in
the
evening
air
vasant
rao
peered
across
the
water
darkening
surface
for
a
time
while
the
drivers
waited
patiently
for
orders
to
begin
crossing
then
he
turned
to
the
waiting
rajputs
the
light
is
too
far
gone
he
stroked
the
mane
of
his
gray
stallion
and
again
studied
the
clouds
building
where
the
sun
had
been
safer
to
camp
here
and
cross
in
the
morning
he
signaled
the
head
driver
and
pointed
the
rajputs
toward
a
sandy
expanse
close
to
the
water
edge
in
moments
the
drivers
were
urging
their
teams
toward
the
spot
circling
them
in
preparation
for
the
night
the
carts
will
go
on
the
riverside
and
we
camp
here
he
specified
areas
for
the
rajputs
and
the
drivers
and
then
he
turned
to
hawksworth
and
pointed
out
a
large
mango
tree
your
tent
can
go
there
hawksworth
had
been
required
by
the
rajputs
to
keep
a
separate
area
for
his
campfire
and
cooking
vasant
rao
had
explained
the
reasons
the
first
evening
of
the
journey
food
is
merely
an
external
part
of
the
body
captain
so
naturally
it
must
be
kept
from
pollution
food
is
transformed
into
blood
and
the
blood
eventually
turns
to
flesh
the
flesh
to
fat
and
the
fat
to
marrow
the
marrow
turns
to
semen
the
since
you
have
no
caste
a
rajput
would
become
polluted
if
he
allowed
you
to
touch
his
food
or
even
the
pots
in
which
he
cooked
hawksworth
driver
being
a
low
caste
had
no
objection
to
cooking
and
eating
with
the
english
ambassador
their
diet
on
the
trip
had
been
simple
the
rajputs
lived
mainly
on
game
they
killed
as
they
rode
though
some
occasionally
ate
fish
a
few
seemed
to
subsist
on
rice
wheat
cakes
and
boiled
lentils
that
night
as
an
experiment
hawksworth
ordered
his
driver
nayka
to
prepare
a
dinner
of
whatever
he
himself
was
having
then
he
reclined
against
his
saddle
poured
himself
a
tankard
of
brandy
and
watched
the
preparations
nayka
struck
up
a
fire
of
twigs
to
ignite
the
chips
of
dried
cow
dung
used
for
the
real
cooking
and
then
he
began
to
heat
a
curved
pan
containing
butter
that
had
been
boiled
and
strained
to
prevent
rancidity
although
the
rajputs
cooked
in
vegetable
oil
nayka
had
insisted
from
the
first
that
a
personage
as
important
as
the
english
should
eat
only
clarified
butter
the
smoldering
chips
of
dung
took
a
long
time
to
heat
but
finally
the
ghee
seemed
ready
nayka
had
ground
spices
as
he
waited
and
he
began
to
throw
them
into
the
hot
fat
to
sputter
then
he
chopped
vegetables
and
dropped
them
in
to
fry
in
a
separate
pot
he
was
already
boiling
lentils
together
with
a
yellow
spice
he
called
turmeric
as
the
meal
neared
readiness
he
began
to
fry
thin
patties
of
unleavened
wheat
flour
mixed
with
water
and
ghee
then
hawksworth
watched
in
shock
as
nayka
discreetly
dropped
a
coal
of
burning
cow
dung
into
the
pot
of
cooking
lentils
what
the
hell
was
that
flavoring
captain
sahib
nayka
turkish
had
been
learned
through
procuring
women
for
turkish
seamen
and
it
was
heavily
accented
and
abrupt
it
the
secret
of
the
flavor
of
our
lentils
is
that
practice
i
think
it
is
the
same
for
all
nayka
examined
him
for
a
moment
twisting
his
head
deferentially
does
the
sahib
know
about
caste
i
know
it
a
damnable
practice
the
sahib
says
what
the
sahib
says
but
caste
is
a
very
good
thing
how
do
you
figure
that
because
i
will
be
reborn
a
brahmin
i
went
to
a
soothsayer
who
told
me
my
next
life
will
be
marvelous
but
what
about
this
life
my
present
birth
was
due
to
a
very
grave
mistake
the
soothsayer
explained
it
he
said
that
in
my
last
life
i
was
a
rajput
once
i
ordered
my
cook
to
prepare
a
gift
for
some
brahmins
to
bake
bread
for
them
and
inside
the
bread
i
had
put
gold
it
was
an
act
of
great
merit
but
the
faithless
cook
betrayed
me
he
stole
the
gold
and
put
stones
in
its
place
the
brahmins
were
very
insulted
but
no
one
ever
told
me
why
because
i
had
insulted
brahmins
i
was
reborn
as
i
am
but
my
next
life
will
be
different
i
will
be
rich
and
have
many
women
like
a
brahmin
or
a
rajput
nayka
eyes
gleamed
in
anticipation
the
improvement
in
money
i
can
understand
hawksworth
examined
nayka
ragged
dhoti
but
what
does
it
matter
when
it
comes
to
women
there
seems
to
be
plenty
of
randy
women
to
go
around
in
all
castes
that
true
if
you
are
a
rajput
or
a
brahmin
then
no
woman
of
any
caste
can
refuse
you
but
if
you
are
a
low
caste
and
you
are
caught
with
a
woman
you
probably
be
beaten
to
death
by
the
rajputs
they
would
say
you
were
polluting
her
caste
wait
a
minute
i
thought
rajputs
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
caste
woman
hawksworth
remembered
vasant
rao
stern
denial
who
told
you
that
nayka
smiled
at
hawksworth
naivete
i
would
guess
a
rajput
they
always
deny
it
to
strangers
so
you
wo
form
unfavorable
ideas
about
the
high
castes
let
me
tell
you
that
it
is
a
lie
captain
sahib
they
take
our
women
all
the
time
and
there
is
nothing
we
can
say
but
a
man
with
a
woman
is
another
matter
but
what
about
their
pollution
they
not
supposed
to
touch
the
low
castes
it
very
simple
a
rajput
can
take
one
of
our
women
if
he
chooses
and
then
just
take
a
bath
afterward
and
he
is
clean
again
but
ca
a
woman
do
the
same
if
she
been
with
a
caste
man
no
captain
sahib
because
they
say
her
pollution
is
internal
she
has
the
polluting
emissions
of
the
man
within
her
so
there
is
no
way
she
can
be
purified
it
the
way
the
high
castes
control
their
women
but
if
you
a
man
you
can
have
any
woman
you
please
and
there
nothing
anyone
can
say
again
nayka
eyes
brightened
it
will
be
wonderful
the
day
i
am
reborn
caste
is
a
wonderful
thing
hawksworth
studied
the
almost
toothless
man
who
stood
before
him
barefoot
grinning
happily
well
enjoy
your
dreams
you
poor
miserable
bitch
i
not
be
the
one
to
tell
you
this
life
is
all
you
get
he
took
a
slug
of
brandy
and
returned
to
his
lentils
taken
with
some
of
the
bread
they
were
actually
better
than
he
expected
vasant
rao
had
already
summoned
the
rajputs
and
made
assignments
for
the
evening
guard
duty
guards
were
to
be
doubled
hawksworth
remained
astounded
by
the
rajput
concept
of
security
a
large
kettledrum
was
set
up
at
the
head
of
the
camp
and
continually
beaten
from
dusk
to
dawn
a
detail
of
rajputs
would
march
around
the
perimeter
of
the
camp
throughout
the
night
and
on
the
quarter
hour
a
shout
of
khabardar
meaning
take
heed
would
circle
the
camp
the
first
night
hawksworth
had
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
for
the
noise
but
the
second
night
and
thereafter
his
weariness
overtook
him
he
poured
himself
another
brandy
and
watched
as
nayka
scrubbed
out
the
cooking
pans
with
ashes
and
sand
then
the
driver
rolled
a
betel
leaf
for
hawksworth
and
another
for
himself
and
set
to
work
erecting
the
tent
which
was
nothing
more
than
four
poles
with
a
canopy
after
this
he
unloaded
hawksworth
cot
a
wooden
frame
strung
with
hemp
none
of
the
rajputs
used
cots
they
preferred
a
thin
pallet
on
the
ground
nayka
seemed
to
work
more
slowly
as
he
started
unrolling
the
bedding
onto
the
hemp
strings
of
the
cot
and
he
began
to
glance
nervously
at
the
sky
suddenly
he
stopped
and
slipped
quietly
to
where
the
other
drivers
were
encamped
seated
on
their
haunches
around
a
fire
passing
the
mouthpiece
of
a
hookah
a
long
discussion
followed
with
much
pointing
at
the
sky
then
nayka
returned
and
approached
hawksworth
twisting
his
head
in
the
deferential
bow
all
indians
seemed
to
use
to
superiors
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
hesitation
and
then
summoned
the
courage
to
speak
it
is
not
well
tonight
sahib
we
have
traveled
this
road
many
times
he
pointed
east
into
the
dark
where
new
lightning
played
across
the
hovering
bank
of
clouds
there
has
been
rain
near
chopda
farther
east
where
the
river
forks
in
two
time
six
of
your
hours
the
river
will
begin
to
rise
here
how
much
will
it
rise
only
the
gods
can
tell
but
the
river
will
spread
beyond
its
banks
and
reach
this
camp
i
have
seen
it
and
it
will
remain
impassable
for
three
days
how
can
you
be
sure
i
have
seen
it
before
sahib
the
drivers
all
know
and
they
are
becoming
afraid
we
know
the
treachery
of
this
river
very
well
but
the
other
bank
is
near
high
ground
if
we
crossed
tonight
we
would
be
safe
again
he
shifted
his
head
deferentially
will
you
please
tell
the
raja
to
the
drivers
vasant
rao
could
only
be
a
raja
a
hereditary
prince
all
important
rajputs
were
automatically
called
rajas
tell
him
yourself
we
would
rather
you
tell
him
captain
sahib
he
is
a
high
caste
it
would
not
be
right
for
us
to
tell
a
raja
what
to
do
hawksworth
watched
for
a
moment
as
the
rajput
guards
began
taking
their
place
around
the
perimeter
of
the
camp
and
then
he
looked
sadly
at
his
waiting
cot
damn
crossing
in
the
dark
could
be
a
needless
risk
why
did
the
drivers
say
something
while
we
still
had
light
god
curse
them
and
their
castes
then
with
a
shrug
of
resignation
he
rose
and
made
his
way
to
vasant
rao
tent
the
rajput
leader
had
already
removed
his
helmet
but
after
listening
to
hawksworth
he
reluctantly
strapped
it
back
on
and
called
for
his
second
in
command
together
they
examined
the
clouds
and
then
walked
down
to
the
river
in
the
dark
no
one
could
tell
if
it
had
begun
to
rise
vasant
rao
ordered
three
rajputs
to
ride
across
carrying
torches
to
test
the
depth
and
mark
out
a
path
the
river
was
wide
but
it
still
was
no
more
than
a
foot
or
two
deep
when
the
third
rajput
finally
reached
the
far
shore
over
a
hundred
yards
away
vasant
rao
issued
orders
to
assemble
the
convoy
the
drivers
moved
quickly
to
harness
their
bullocks
which
had
been
tethered
to
stakes
near
bundles
of
hay
the
weary
cattle
tossed
their
heads
and
sniffed
suspiciously
at
the
moist
air
as
they
were
whipped
into
harness
meanwhile
the
rajput
guards
began
saddling
their
horses
hawksworth
saddled
his
own
mare
and
watched
as
his
cot
and
tent
were
rolled
and
strapped
into
the
cart
alongside
his
chest
he
stared
again
into
the
darkness
that
enveloped
the
river
nothing
could
be
seen
except
the
three
torches
on
the
distant
shore
suddenly
he
seemed
to
hear
a
warning
bell
in
the
back
of
his
mind
we
too
exposed
half
the
guard
will
be
in
the
river
while
we
cross
and
there
be
no
way
to
group
the
carts
if
we
need
to
he
paused
a
moment
then
retrieved
his
sword
from
the
cart
and
buckled
it
on
next
he
checked
the
prime
on
the
two
matchlock
pocket
pistols
he
carried
one
in
each
boot
five
mounted
rajputs
holding
torches
led
as
the
convoy
started
across
the
sandy
alluvium
toward
the
river
hawksworth
cart
was
the
first
to
move
and
as
he
drew
his
mare
alongside
nayka
threw
him
a
grateful
smile
through
the
flickering
light
of
the
torch
strapped
against
one
of
the
cart
poles
you
saved
us
all
captain
sahib
when
the
river
grows
angry
nothing
can
appease
her
the
bullocks
nosed
warily
at
the
water
but
nayka
gave
them
the
lash
and
they
waded
in
without
protest
the
bed
was
gravel
smoothed
by
the
long
action
of
the
stream
and
the
water
was
still
shallow
allowing
the
large
wheels
of
the
carts
to
roll
easily
hawksworth
pulled
his
mount
close
to
the
cart
and
let
its
enormous
wheel
splash
coolness
against
his
horse
flank
the
current
grew
swifter
as
they
reached
the
center
of
the
stream
but
the
bullocks
plodded
along
evenly
almost
as
though
they
were
on
dry
ground
then
the
current
eased
again
and
hawksworth
noticed
that
the
rajputs
riding
ahead
had
already
reined
in
their
mounts
signifying
they
had
gained
the
far
shore
their
five
torches
merged
with
the
three
of
the
rajputs
already
waiting
and
together
they
lined
the
edge
hawksworth
twisted
in
the
saddle
and
looked
back
at
the
line
of
carts
they
traveled
abreast
in
pairs
a
torchman
riding
between
and
the
caravan
had
become
an
eerie
procession
of
waving
lights
and
shadows
against
the
dark
water
the
last
carts
were
in
the
river
now
and
vasant
rao
was
riding
rapidly
toward
him
carrying
a
torch
looks
like
i
was
wrong
again
hawksworth
thought
and
he
turned
to
rein
his
horse
as
it
stumbled
against
a
submerged
rock
the
torches
along
the
shore
were
gone
he
stared
in
disbelief
for
a
moment
and
then
he
saw
them
sputtering
in
the
water
edge
lightning
flashed
in
the
east
revealing
the
silhouettes
of
the
rajputs
mounts
stumbling
along
the
shore
their
saddles
empty
he
whirled
to
check
the
caravan
behind
him
and
at
that
moment
an
arrow
ricocheted
off
the
pole
of
the
cart
and
ripped
cleanly
through
the
side
of
his
jerkin
he
suddenly
realized
the
torch
lashed
to
the
side
of
the
cart
illuminated
him
brilliantly
and
he
drew
his
sword
and
swung
at
its
base
slicing
it
in
half
as
it
fell
sputtering
he
saw
a
second
arrow
catch
nayka
squarely
in
the
throat
and
he
watched
the
driver
spin
and
slump
wordlessly
into
the
water
godforsaken
luckless
hindu
now
you
can
be
reborn
a
brahmin
only
sooner
than
you
thought
a
shout
of
alarm
erupted
from
behind
and
he
looked
to
see
the
remaining
rajputs
charging
in
formation
bows
already
drawn
the
water
churned
around
him
as
they
dashed
by
advancing
on
the
shore
the
rajputs
horn
bows
hissed
in
rapid
succession
as
they
sent
volleys
of
bamboo
arrows
into
the
darkness
but
the
returning
rain
of
arrows
was
dense
and
deadly
he
saw
the
rajput
nearest
him
suddenly
pivot
backward
in
the
saddle
an
arrow
lodged
in
his
groin
below
his
leather
chest
guard
hawksworth
watched
incredulously
as
the
man
clung
to
his
saddle
horn
for
a
long
last
moment
pulling
himself
erect
and
releasing
a
final
arrow
before
tumbling
into
the
water
again
lightning
flared
across
the
sky
and
in
the
sudden
illumination
hawksworth
could
see
shapes
along
the
shore
an
army
of
mounted
horsemen
well
over
a
hundred
they
were
drawn
in
tight
formation
calmly
firing
into
the
approaching
rajputs
the
lightning
flashed
once
more
a
broad
sheet
of
fire
across
the
sky
and
at
that
moment
hawksworth
saw
vasant
rao
gain
the
shore
where
he
was
instantly
surrounded
by
a
menacing
wall
of
shields
and
pikes
then
more
of
the
rajputs
gained
the
shore
and
he
could
hear
their
chant
of
ram
ram
their
famous
battle
cry
the
horsemen
were
moving
on
the
caravan
now
and
when
the
lightning
blazed
again
hawksworth
realized
he
had
been
surrounded
the
dark
figure
in
the
lead
seized
hawksworth
right
arm
from
behind
and
began
to
grapple
for
his
sword
as
he
struggled
to
draw
it
away
the
butt
end
of
a
pike
came
down
hard
on
his
forearm
a
shot
of
pain
pierced
through
to
his
mind
clearing
away
the
last
haze
of
the
brandy
you
bastard
hawksworth
realized
he
was
shouting
in
english
get
ready
to
die
he
twisted
forward
and
with
his
free
hand
stretched
for
the
pistol
in
his
boot
slowly
his
grip
closed
about
the
cool
horn
of
the
handle
and
with
a
single
motion
he
drew
it
upward
still
grasping
the
sword
as
he
raised
himself
erect
he
caught
the
outline
of
a
dark
object
swinging
above
him
in
the
air
then
the
lightning
flashed
again
glinting
off
the
three
large
silver
knobs
they
were
being
swung
by
the
man
who
held
his
sword
arm
my
god
it
a
the
club
some
of
the
rajputs
carry
on
their
saddle
it
a
killer
he
heard
it
arc
above
him
singing
through
the
dark
unlike
the
rajputs
he
had
no
leather
helmet
no
padded
armor
there
was
no
time
to
avoid
the
blow
but
he
had
the
pistol
now
and
he
shoved
it
into
the
man
gut
and
squeezed
there
was
a
sudden
blinding
flash
of
light
it
started
at
his
hand
but
then
it
seemed
to
explode
inside
his
skull
the
world
had
grown
white
like
the
marble
walls
of
mukarrab
khan
music
room
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
heard
again
the
echo
of
drumbeats
the
cycle
swelled
sensuously
then
suddenly
reached
its
culmination
when
all
emotion
dissolved
in
the
silence
that
followed
there
was
only
the
face
of
mukarrab
khan
surrounded
by
his
eunuchs
his
smile
slowly
fading
into
black
chapter
fourteen
the
light
of
a
single
flame
tip
burned
through
the
haze
of
his
vision
and
then
he
heard
words
around
him
in
a
terse
language
as
ancient
as
time
he
tried
to
move
and
an
aching
soreness
shot
through
his
shoulders
and
into
his
groin
his
head
seemed
afire
i
must
be
dead
why
is
there
still
pain
he
forced
his
swollen
eyelids
wider
and
a
room
slowly
began
to
take
form
it
was
a
cell
with
heavy
bamboo
slats
over
the
windows
and
an
ancient
wooden
latch
on
the
door
the
floor
was
earth
and
the
walls
gray
mud
with
occasional
inscriptions
in
red
next
to
him
was
a
silhouette
the
outline
of
a
man
squatting
before
an
oil
lamp
and
slowly
repeating
a
sharp
toneless
verse
he
puzzled
at
the
words
as
he
studied
the
figure
it
the
language
of
the
priest
at
the
wedding
it
must
be
sanskrit
but
who
he
pulled
himself
upward
on
an
elbow
and
turned
toward
the
figure
which
seemed
to
flicker
in
the
undulating
shadows
then
he
recognized
the
profile
of
vasant
rao
the
verses
stopped
abruptly
and
the
rajput
turned
to
examine
him
so
you
not
dead
that
could
be
a
mistake
you
regret
vasant
rao
face
sagged
and
his
moustache
was
an
unkempt
tangle
he
stared
at
hawksworth
a
moment
more
then
turned
back
to
the
lamp
the
sanskrit
verses
resumed
where
the
hell
are
we
vasant
rao
paused
and
then
slowly
revolved
toward
hawksworth
in
the
fortress
village
of
bhandu
ten
northwest
of
the
town
of
chopda
it
the
mountain
stronghold
of
the
chandella
dynasty
of
rajputs
and
who
the
hell
are
they
they
claim
direct
descent
from
the
ancient
solar
race
of
rajputs
described
in
the
puranas
who
knows
but
that
what
they
believe
what
we
all
do
know
is
they
defended
these
hills
for
all
of
time
did
they
take
the
caravan
a
bolt
of
humiliation
and
pain
swept
through
vasant
rao
eyes
for
a
moment
and
then
his
reserve
returned
yes
it
was
taken
so
your
mighty
race
is
really
a
breed
of
cursed
common
bandits
bandits
they
are
they
always
have
been
common
no
professionals
honorable
men
of
high
caste
thieves
like
some
of
the
merchants
i
met
hawksworth
paused
and
tried
to
find
his
tongue
his
mouth
was
like
cotton
how
long
we
been
here
this
is
the
morning
of
our
second
day
we
arrived
yesterday
after
traveling
all
night
i
feel
like
i
been
keelhauled
for
a
week
hawksworth
gingerly
touched
his
forehead
and
there
was
a
pulse
of
pain
vasant
rao
listened
with
a
puzzled
expression
you
were
tied
over
your
horse
some
of
the
clan
wanted
to
kill
you
and
leave
you
there
but
then
they
decided
that
would
give
you
too
much
honor
what
the
hell
are
you
talking
about
i
remember
i
gave
them
a
fight
you
used
a
pistol
you
killed
a
man
the
head
of
this
dynasty
with
a
pistol
the
words
seemed
to
cut
through
the
shadows
of
the
room
the
pain
returned
and
ached
through
hawksworth
body
more
deaths
the
two
men
who
died
on
the
i
saw
nayka
die
with
an
arrow
in
his
throat
and
how
many
of
the
rajput
guards
died
why
am
i
always
in
the
middle
of
fighting
and
death
the
bastards
killed
my
driver
the
driver
was
nothing
a
low
caste
he
shrugged
it
away
you
are
an
important
you
would
not
have
been
harmed
you
should
never
have
drawn
a
pistol
and
then
you
allowed
yourself
to
be
captured
it
was
an
act
beneath
honor
the
women
spat
on
you
and
your
horse
when
you
were
brought
through
the
streets
i
have
no
doubt
they
kill
us
both
now
who
left
alive
no
one
my
men
died
like
rajputs
a
trace
of
pride
flashed
through
his
eyes
before
they
dimmed
again
with
sadness
when
they
knew
they
could
not
win
that
they
had
failed
the
prince
they
vowed
to
die
fighting
and
all
did
but
you
still
alive
the
words
seemed
almost
like
a
knife
in
the
rajput
heart
they
would
not
kill
me
or
let
me
die
honorably
he
paused
and
stared
at
hawksworth
there
was
a
reason
but
it
does
concern
you
so
all
the
men
died
but
why
did
they
kill
the
drivers
the
drivers
were
killed
vasant
rao
looked
surprised
i
never
said
that
i
keep
forgetting
hawksworth
told
himself
that
only
high
castes
count
as
men
in
this
land
this
whole
damned
country
is
mad
the
absurdity
overwhelmed
him
low
castes
your
own
people
handled
like
slaves
and
high
castes
who
kill
each
other
in
the
name
of
honor
a
pox
on
rajputs
and
their
fornicating
honor
honor
is
very
important
without
honor
what
is
left
we
may
as
well
be
without
caste
the
warrior
caste
lives
by
a
code
set
down
in
the
laws
of
manu
many
thousands
of
years
ago
he
saw
hawksworth
impatience
and
smiled
sadly
do
you
understand
what
meant
by
it
sounds
like
another
damned
hindu
invention
another
excuse
to
take
life
is
something
captain
hawksworth
without
which
life
no
longer
matters
no
christian
or
muslim
has
ever
been
able
to
understand
since
it
is
the
order
that
defines
our
castes
and
those
born
outside
india
are
doomed
to
live
forever
without
a
caste
defines
who
we
are
and
what
we
must
do
if
we
are
to
maintain
our
caste
warfare
is
the
of
the
kshatriya
the
warrior
caste
and
i
say
a
pox
on
caste
what
so
honorable
about
rajputs
slaughtering
each
other
warriors
are
bound
by
their
to
join
in
battle
against
other
warriors
a
warrior
who
fails
in
his
duty
sins
against
the
of
his
caste
vasant
rao
paused
but
why
am
i
bothering
to
tell
you
this
i
sound
like
krishna
lecturing
arjuna
on
his
duty
as
a
warrior
who
krishna
another
rajput
he
a
god
captain
hawksworth
sacred
to
all
rajputs
he
teaches
us
that
a
warrior
must
always
honor
his
vasant
rao
eyes
seemed
to
burn
through
the
shadows
of
the
cell
from
outside
hawksworth
heard
the
distant
chantings
of
some
village
ceremony
if
you
listen
captain
i
tell
you
something
about
a
warrior
there
a
legend
many
thousands
of
years
old
of
a
great
battle
joined
between
two
branches
of
a
powerful
dynasty
in
ancient
india
two
kings
were
brothers
and
they
shared
a
kingdom
but
their
sons
could
not
live
in
peace
one
branch
wished
to
destroy
the
other
eventually
a
battle
was
joined
a
battle
to
the
death
as
they
waited
on
the
field
for
the
sound
of
the
conch
shell
to
summon
the
forces
the
leader
of
those
sons
who
had
been
wronged
suddenly
declared
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
kill
his
own
kinsmen
but
the
god
krishna
who
was
charioteer
for
this
son
reminded
him
he
must
follow
his
that
there
is
no
greater
good
for
a
warrior
than
to
join
battle
for
what
is
right
it
wrong
only
if
he
is
attached
to
the
fruits
of
battle
if
he
does
it
for
gain
it
told
in
the
gita
a
sanskrit
scripture
sacred
to
all
warriors
i
was
reciting
a
verse
from
chapter
twelve
when
you
woke
what
did
this
god
krishna
say
he
declared
that
all
who
live
must
die
and
all
who
die
will
be
reborn
the
spirit
within
us
all
the
can
not
be
destroyed
it
travels
through
us
on
its
journey
from
birth
to
rebirth
but
it
not
correct
to
say
merely
that
it
exists
it
is
existence
it
is
the
only
reality
it
is
present
in
everything
because
it
is
everything
therefore
there
no
need
to
mourn
for
death
there
is
no
death
the
body
is
merely
an
appearance
by
which
the
reveals
itself
the
body
is
only
its
guardian
but
a
warrior
who
turns
away
from
the
duty
of
his
caste
sins
against
his
honor
and
his
krishna
warned
that
this
loss
of
honor
could
one
day
lead
to
the
mixture
of
castes
and
then
the
dharma
of
the
universe
its
necessary
order
would
be
destroyed
it
not
wrong
for
a
rajput
to
kill
a
worthy
foe
captain
hawksworth
it
his
duty
just
as
it
also
his
duty
to
die
a
worthy
death
why
all
this
killing
in
the
name
of
and
always
want
to
know
to
you
always
seem
to
believe
that
words
somehow
contain
all
truth
but
dharma
simply
is
it
is
the
air
we
breathe
the
changeless
order
around
us
we
part
of
it
does
the
earth
ask
why
the
monsoons
come
does
the
seed
ask
why
the
sun
shines
each
day
no
it
the
dharma
of
the
seed
is
to
bear
fruit
the
dharma
of
the
warrior
caste
is
to
do
battle
only
who
live
outside
our
dharma
ask
truth
is
not
something
you
it
something
you
part
of
something
you
feel
with
your
being
and
when
you
try
to
catch
it
with
words
it
gone
can
the
eagle
tell
you
how
he
flies
captain
hawksworth
or
if
he
could
he
would
no
longer
be
an
eagle
this
is
the
great
wisdom
of
india
we
learned
it
wasted
on
captain
as
i
fear
it
now
wasted
on
you
the
talk
left
hawksworth
feeling
strangely
insecure
his
mind
wrestling
with
ideas
that
defied
rationality
i
know
there
are
things
you
understand
with
your
gut
not
with
your
head
then
there
may
be
hope
for
you
captain
hawksworth
now
we
will
see
if
you
can
die
like
a
rajput
if
you
can
perhaps
you
will
be
reborn
one
of
us
then
i
might
even
learn
to
be
a
bandit
all
rajputs
are
not
the
same
captain
there
are
many
tribes
descended
from
different
dynasties
each
has
its
own
tradition
and
genealogy
i
from
the
north
from
the
races
descended
from
the
moon
this
tribe
claims
descent
from
the
solar
dynasty
which
also
began
in
the
north
i
think
their
genealogy
goes
back
to
the
god
indra
who
they
claim
brought
them
into
being
with
the
aid
of
the
sun
vasant
rao
turned
and
continued
reciting
in
sanskrit
his
face
again
became
a
mask
hawksworth
rubbed
his
head
in
confusion
and
suddenly
felt
a
hard
lump
where
the
club
had
dropped
the
fear
began
to
well
up
in
his
stomach
as
he
remembered
the
riders
who
had
surrounded
him
in
the
river
but
he
pushed
aside
thoughts
of
death
be
damned
what
did
he
mean
they
members
of
a
clan
descended
from
the
solar
dynasty
they
killers
looking
for
an
excuse
to
plunder
i
not
planning
to
die
like
a
rajput
just
yet
or
be
reborn
as
one
life
is
too
sweet
just
as
it
is
i
beginning
to
feel
alive
here
for
the
first
time
ever
shirin
is
free
i
got
a
feeling
i
be
seeing
her
again
whatever
happens
i
do
care
to
die
in
this
piss
hole
with
empty
talk
about
honor
think
he
remembered
the
river
again
and
quickly
felt
in
his
boot
the
other
pistol
was
still
there
we
find
a
way
to
get
out
somehow
we
may
just
lose
a
few
time
that
all
we
made
good
time
so
far
six
days
we
left
on
sunday
and
we
been
here
two
days
so
today
is
probably
monday
he
suddenly
froze
where
are
the
carts
at
the
south
end
of
the
village
where
they
have
the
the
cattle
sheds
the
drivers
are
there
too
is
my
chest
there
no
it
right
there
behind
you
vasant
rao
pointed
into
the
dark
i
told
them
it
belonged
to
the
moghul
and
they
brought
it
here
i
guess
the
moghul
still
counts
for
something
here
maybe
superstitious
about
him
hawksworth
pulled
himself
up
and
reached
behind
him
the
chest
was
there
he
fingered
the
cool
metal
of
the
lock
and
his
mind
began
to
clear
even
more
quickly
he
began
to
search
his
jerkin
for
the
key
its
pockets
were
empty
of
course
if
i
was
tied
over
a
horse
then
he
remembered
for
safety
he
had
transferred
it
to
the
pocket
of
his
breeches
the
second
day
out
he
felt
down
his
leg
fighting
the
ache
in
his
arm
miraculously
the
key
was
still
there
he
tried
to
hold
his
excitement
as
he
twisted
it
into
the
lock
on
the
chest
once
twice
and
it
clicked
he
quickly
checked
the
contents
lute
on
top
letter
still
wrapped
clothes
then
he
felt
deeper
and
touched
the
metal
slowly
he
drew
it
out
holding
his
breath
it
was
still
intact
the
light
from
the
lamp
glanced
off
the
burnished
brass
of
the
persian
astrolabe
from
the
observatory
it
had
been
mukarrab
khan
parting
gift
he
carried
it
to
the
slatted
window
and
carefully
twisted
each
slat
until
the
sun
began
to
stream
through
thank
god
it
late
in
the
year
when
the
sun
already
lower
at
midday
he
took
a
quick
reading
of
the
sun
elevation
it
had
not
yet
reached
its
zenith
he
made
a
mental
note
of
the
reading
and
began
to
wait
five
minutes
passed
they
seemed
hours
and
he
checked
the
elevation
again
the
sun
was
still
climbing
but
he
knew
it
would
soon
reach
its
highest
point
vasant
rao
continued
to
chant
verses
from
the
gita
in
terse
toneless
sanskrit
he
probably
thinks
i
praying
too
hawksworth
smiled
to
himself
the
reading
increased
then
stayed
the
same
then
began
to
decrease
the
sun
had
passed
its
zenith
and
he
had
the
exact
reading
of
its
elevation
he
mentally
recorded
the
reading
then
began
to
rummage
in
the
bottom
of
the
chest
for
the
seaman
book
he
always
carried
with
him
we
left
surat
on
october
so
october
was
karod
the
was
viara
the
was
corka
the
was
narayanpur
the
was
the
river
today
has
to
be
october
the
book
was
there
its
pages
still
musty
from
the
moist
air
at
sea
he
reached
the
page
he
wanted
and
ran
his
finger
down
a
column
of
figures
until
he
reached
the
one
he
had
read
off
the
astrolabe
from
the
reading
the
latitude
here
is
degrees
and
minutes
north
then
he
began
to
search
the
chest
for
a
sheaf
of
papers
and
finally
his
fingers
closed
around
them
buried
beneath
his
spare
jerkin
he
squinted
in
the
half
light
as
he
went
through
the
pages
the
handwriting
hurried
from
hasty
work
in
the
observatory
finally
he
found
what
he
wanted
he
had
copied
it
directly
from
the
old
samarkand
astronomer
calculations
the
numerals
were
as
bold
as
the
day
he
had
written
them
the
latitude
was
there
and
the
date
with
a
tight
smile
that
pained
his
aching
face
he
carefully
wrapped
the
astrolabe
and
returned
it
to
the
bottom
of
the
chest
together
with
the
books
he
snapped
the
lock
in
place
just
as
the
door
of
the
cell
swung
open
he
looked
up
to
see
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
swung
the
club
good
jesus
i
thought
he
was
dead
and
he
looks
even
younger
then
hawksworth
realized
it
had
to
be
his
son
but
the
heavy
brow
the
dark
beard
the
narrow
eyes
were
all
the
same
almost
as
though
his
father
blood
had
flowed
directly
into
his
veins
he
wore
no
helmet
or
breastplate
now
only
a
simple
robe
entirely
white
the
man
spoke
curtly
to
vasant
rao
in
a
language
hawksworth
did
not
understand
he
has
ordered
us
to
come
with
him
it
time
for
the
ceremony
he
says
you
must
watch
how
the
man
you
killed
is
honored
vasant
rao
rose
easily
and
pinched
out
the
oil
lamp
in
the
darkened
silence
hawksworth
heard
the
lowing
of
cattle
as
well
as
the
distant
drone
of
a
chant
outside
the
guards
were
waiting
he
noted
they
carried
sheathed
swords
and
they
too
were
dressed
in
white
in
the
midday
sunshine
he
quickly
tried
to
survey
the
terrain
jagged
rock
outcrops
seemed
to
ring
the
village
with
a
gorge
providing
an
easily
protected
entrance
he
was
right
it
a
fortress
and
probably
impregnable
the
road
was
wide
with
rows
of
homes
on
either
side
and
ahead
was
an
open
square
where
a
crowd
had
gathered
facing
the
square
at
the
far
end
was
an
immense
house
of
baked
brick
the
largest
in
the
fortress
village
with
a
wide
front
and
a
high
porch
as
they
approached
the
square
hawksworth
realized
a
deep
pit
had
been
newly
excavated
directly
in
the
center
mourners
clustered
nearby
silently
waiting
while
a
group
of
women
five
in
all
held
hands
and
moved
slowly
around
the
pit
intoning
a
dirge
as
they
reached
the
side
of
the
opening
he
saw
the
rajput
body
lying
face
up
on
a
fragrant
bier
of
sandalwood
and
branches
his
head
and
beard
had
been
shaved
and
his
body
bound
in
a
silk
winding
sheet
he
was
surrounded
by
garlands
of
flowers
the
wood
in
the
pit
smelled
of
and
coconut

alongside

clear
the
brahmins

enough
hawksworth
looked
around
at
the
square
and
the
nearby
houses
their
shutters
all
sealed
in
mourning
chanting
priests
in
ceremonial
robes
had
stationed
themselves
near
the
large
house
and
an
arabian
mare
all
white
and
bedecked
with
flowers
was
tied
at
the
entrance
suddenly
the
tones
of
mournful
discordant
music
sounded
around
him
as
hawksworth
watched
the
heavy
wooden
doors
of
the
great
house
opened
slowly
and
a
woman
stepped
into
the
midday
sunshine
even
from
their
distance
he
could
see
that
she
was
resplendent
in
an
immaculate
white
wrap
that
sparkled
with
gold
ornaments
and
her
movements
regal
as
she
descended
the
steps
and
was
helped
onto
the
horse
as
she
rode
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
pit
she
was
supported
on
each
side
by
brahmin
priests
men
with
stripes
of
white
clay
painted
down
their
forehead
she
is
his
wife
vasant
rao
had
also
turned
to
watch
now
you
see
a
woman
of
the
warrior
caste
follow
her
as
the
woman
rode
slowly
by
hawksworth
sensed
she
was
only
barely
conscious
of
her
surroundings
as
though
she
had
been
drugged
she
circled
the
pit
three
times
then
stopped
near
where
hawksworth
and
vasant
rao
were
standing
as
the
priests
helped
her
down
from
the
mare
one
urged
her
to
drink
again
from
a
cup
of
dense
liquid
he
carried
her
silk
robe
was
fragrant
with
scented
oil
and
hawksworth
saw
that
decorations
of
saffron
and
sandalwood
had
been
applied
to
her
arms
and
forehead
it
a
curious
form
of
mourning
she
dressed
and
perfumed
as
though
for
a
banquet
not
a
funeral
and
what
she
drinking
from
the
way
she
moves
i
guess
it
some
opium
concoction
she
paused
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
seemed
to
glare
for
an
instant
at
the
five
women
who
moved
around
her
then
she
drank
again
from
the
cup
and
calmly
began
removing
her
jewels
handing
them
to
the
priest
until
her
only
ornament
was
a
necklace
of
dark
seeds
next
the
brahmins
sprinkled
her
head
with
water
from
a
pot
and
as
a
bell
began
to
toll
started
helping
her
into
the
pit
hawksworth
watched
in
disbelief
as
she
knelt
next
to
her
husband
body
and
lovingly
cradled
his
head
against
her
lap
her
eyes
were
lifeless
but
serene
the
realization
of
what
was
happening
struck
hawksworth
like
a
blow
in
the
chest
but
how
could
it
be
true
it
was
unthinkable
then
the
man
who
had
brought
them
the
son
held
out
his
hand
and
one
of
the
brahmins
bowed
and
handed
him
a
burning
torch
it
flared
brilliantly
against
the
dark
pile
of
earth
at
the
front
of
the
pit
god
almighty
no
hawksworth
instinctively
started
to
reach
for
his
pistol
a
deafening
chorus
of
wails
burst
from
the
waiting
women
as
the
young
man
flung
the
torch
directly
by
the
head
of
the
bier
next
the
priests
threw
more
lighted
torches
alongside
the
corpse
followed
by
more
oil
the
flames
licked
tentatively
around
the
edges
of
the
wood
then
burst
across
the
top
of
the
pyre
the
fire
swirled
around
the
woman
and
in
an
instant
her
robes
flared
enveloping
her
body
and
igniting
her
hair
hawksworth
saw
her
open
her
mouth
and
say
something
words
he
did
not
understand
and
then
the
pain
overcame
her
and
she
screamed
and
tried
frantically
to
move
toward
the
edge
of
the
pit
as
she
reached
the
edge
she
saw
the
hovering
priests
waiting
with
long
poles
to
push
her
away
and
she
stumbled
backward
her
last
screams
were
drowned
by
the
chorus
of
wailing
women
as
she
collapsed
across
the
body
of
her
husband
a
human
torch
hawksworth
stepped
back
in
horror
and
whirled
on
vasant
rao
who
stood
watching
impassively
this
is
murder
is
this
more
of
your
rajput
it
is
what
we
call
when
a
brave
woman
joins
her
husband
in
death
did
you
hear
what
she
said
she
pronounced
the
words
as
the
left
her
at
the
moment
of
death
we
sometimes
have
the
gift
of
prophecy
she
was
saying
this
is
the
fifth
time
she
has
burned
herself
with
the
same
husband
and
that
only
two
times
more
are
required
to
release
her
from
the
cycle
of
birth
and
death
to
render
her
a
perfect
being
i
ca
believe
she
burned
herself
willingly
of
course
she
did
rajput
women
are
noble
it
was
the
way
she
honored
her
husband
and
her
caste
it
was
her
hawksworth
stared
again
at
the
pit
priests
were
throwing
more
oil
on
the
raging
flames
which
already
had
enveloped
the
two
bodies
and
now
licked
around
the
edges
almost
at
hawksworth
feet
the
five
women
seemed
crazed
with
grief
as
they
held
hands
and
moved
along
the
edge
in
a
delirious
dance
the
heat
had
become
intense
and
hawksworth
instinctively
stepped
back
as
tongues
of
fire
licked
over
the
edge
of
the
pit
the
mourning
women
appeared
heedless
of
their
own
danger
as
they
continued
to
circle
their
light
cloth
robes
now
only
inches
from
the
flame
the
air
was
filled
with
the
smell
of
death
and
burning
flesh
they
must
be
mad
with
grief
they
catch
their
clothes
at
that
instant
the
hem
of
one
of
the
women
robes
ignited
she
examined
the
whipping
flame
with
a
wild
empty
gaze
almost
as
though
not
seeing
it
then
she
turned
on
the
other
women
terror
and
confusion
in
her
eyes
hawksworth
was
already
peeling
off
his
jerkin
he
seen
enough
fires
on
the
gun
deck
to
know
the
man
whose
clothes
caught
always
panicked
if
i
can
reach
her
in
time
i
can
smother
the
robe
before
she
burned
and
maimed
her
legs
before
he
could
move
the
woman
suddenly
turned
and
poised
herself
at
the
edge
of
the
roaring
pit
she
emitted
one
long
intense
wail
then
threw
herself
directly
into
the
fire
at
that
moment
the
robes
of
a
second
woman
caught
and
she
too
turned
and
plunged
into
the
flames
merciful
god
what
are
they
doing
the
three
remaining
women
paused
for
a
moment
then
they
clasped
hands
and
as
though
on
a
private
signal
plunged
over
the
edge
into
the
inferno
their
hair
and
robes
igniting
like
dry
tinder
in
a
furnace
the
women
all
clung
together
as
the
flames
enveloped
them
hawksworth
tried
to
look
again
into
the
pit
but
turned
away
in
revulsion
what
in
hell
is
happening
vasant
rao
eyes
were
flooded
with
disbelief
they
must
have
been
his
concubines
or
his
other
wives
only
his
first
wife
was
allowed
to
have
the
place
of
honor
beside
his
body
i
the
rajput
struggled
for
composure
i
never
seen
so
many
women
die
in
a
it
he
seemed
unable
to
find
words
it
almost
too
much
how
did
such
a
murderous
custom
begin
hawksworth
eyes
were
seared
now
from
the
smoke
and
the
smell
of
burning
flesh
it
unworthy
of
humanity
we
believe
aristocratic
rajput
women
have
always
wished
to
do
it
to
honor
their
brave
warriors
the
moghul
has
tried
to
stop
it
however
he
claims
it
began
only
a
few
centuries
ago
when
a
rajput
raja
suspected
the
women
in
his
palace
were
trying
to
poison
him
and
his
ministers
some
believe
the
raja
decreed
that
custom
as
protection
for
his
own
life
and
then
others
followed
but
i
do
think
that
true
i
believe
women
in
india
have
always
done
it
from
ancient
times
but
what
does
it
matter
when
it
began
now
all
rani
the
wives
of
rajas
follow
their
husbands
in
death
and
consider
it
a
great
honor
today
it
seems
his
other
women
also
insisted
on
joining
her
i
think
it
was
against
her
wishes
she
did
not
want
to
share
her
moment
of
glory
is
a
noble
custom
captain
hawksworth
part
of
that
rajput
strength
of
character
wanting
in
other
races
a
hand
seized
hawksworth
arm
roughly
and
jerked
him
back
through
the
crowd
a
sea
of
eyes
burning
with
contempt
amid
the
drifting
smoke
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
bullock
carts
of
the
caravan
lined
along
the
far
end
of
the
road
leading
into
the
fortress
the
drivers
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
near
the
carts
were
cattle
sheds
for
the
bullocks
if
they
can
send
innocent
women
to
their
death
life
means
nothing
here
they
kill
us
for
sure
he
turned
to
vasant
rao
whose
face
showed
no
trace
of
fear
the
rajput
seemed
oblivious
to
the
smell
of
death
as
smoke
from
the
fire
engulfed
the
palms
that
lined
the
village
roads
they
were
approaching
the
porch
of
the
great
house
where
the
head
of
the
dynasty
had
lived
two
guards
shoved
hawksworth
roughly
to
his
knees
he
looked
up
to
see
standing
on
the
porch
of
the
house
the
young
man
who
had
tossed
the
torch
into
the
pit
he
began
speaking
to
them
in
the
tones
of
an
announcement
he
the
son
of
the
man
you
killed
he
has
claimed
leadership
of
the
dynasty
and
calls
himself
raj
singh
vasant
rao
translated
rapidly
as
the
man
continued
speaking
he
says
that
tomorrow
there
will
be
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
here
it
is
predicted
in
the
panjika
the
hindu
manual
of
astrology
his
father
the
leader
of
this
dynasty
of
the
sun
has
died
and
tomorrow
the
sun
will
die
also
for
a
time
the
brahmins
have
said
it
is
fitting
that
you
die
with
it
for
high
castes
in
india
the
death
of
the
sun
is
an
evil
time
a
time
when
the
two
great
powers
of
the
sky
are
in
conflict
on
the
day
of
an
eclipse
no
fires
are
lit
in
our
homes
food
is
discarded
and
all
open
earthenware
pots
are
smashed
no
one
who
wears
the
sacred
thread
of
the
can
be
out
of
doors
during
an
eclipse
the
brahmin
astrologers
have
judged
it
is
the
proper
time
for
you
to
pay
for
your
cowardly
act
you
will
be
left
on
a
pike
to
die
in
the
center
of
the
square
hawksworth
drew
himself
up
his
eyes
still
smarting
from
the
smoke
and
tried
to
fix
the
man
eyes
then
he
spoke
in
a
voice
he
hoped
would
carry
to
all
the
waiting
crowd
tell
him
his
brahmin
astrologers
know
not
the
truth
neither
past
nor
future
hawksworth
forced
himself
to
still
the
tremble
in
his
voice
there
will
be
no
eclipse
tomorrow
his
brahmins
who
can
not
foretell
the
great
events
in
the
heavens
should
have
no
right
to
work
their
will
on
earth
have
you
gone
mad
vasant
rao
turned
and
glared
at
him
as
he
spat
the
words
in
disgust
why
not
try
to
die
with
dignity
tell
him
vasant
rao
stared
at
hawksworth
in
dumb
amazement
do
you
think
all
fools
the
eclipse
is
foretold
in
the
panjika
it
is
the
sacred
book
of
the
brahmins
it
used
to
pick
auspicious
days
for
ceremonies
for
weddings
for
planting
crops
eclipses
are
predicted
many
years
ahead
in
the
panjika
they
have
been
forecast
in
india
for
centuries
do
europeans
know
an
eclipse
is
a
meeting
of
the
sun
and
moon
nothing
can
change
that
tell
him
what
i
said
exactly
vasant
rao
hesitated
for
a
few
moments
and
then
reluctantly
translated
the
rajput
chieftain
face
did
not
change
and
his
reply
was
curt
vasant
rao
turned
to
hawksworth
he
says
you
are
a
fool
as
well
as
an
untouchable
tell
him
that
if
i
am
to
die
with
the
sun
he
must
kill
me
now
i
spit
on
his
brahmins
and
their
panjika
i
say
the
eclipse
will
be
this
very
day
in
less
than
three
hours
in
one
yes
no
god
and
certainly
no
man
can
control
such
things
why
tell
him
this
invention
vasant
rao
voice
rose
with
his
anger
when
this
thing
does
not
happen
you
will
die
in
even
greater
dishonor
tell
him
vasant
rao
again
translated
his
voice
hesitant
raj
singh
examined
hawksworth
skeptically
then
he
turned
and
spoke
to
one
of
the
tall
rajputs
standing
nearby
who
walked
to
the
end
of
the
porch
and
summoned
several
brahmin
priests
after
a
conference
marked
by
much
angry
shouting
and
gesturing
one
of
the
brahmins
turned
and
left
moments
later
he
reappeared
carrying
a
book
they
have
consulted
the
panjika
again
vasant
rao
pointed
toward
the
book
as
one
of
the
brahmins
directed
a
stream
of
language
at
raj
singh
he
says
there
is
no
mistaking
the
date
of
the
eclipse
and
the
time
it
is
in
the
lunar
month
of
asvina
which
is
your
here
in
the
deccan
the
month
begins
and
ends
with
the
full
moon
the
or
lunar
day
of
the
eclipse
begins
tomorrow
as
hawksworth
listened
he
felt
his
heart
begin
to
race
the
calculations
at
the
observatory
had
a
lot
to
say
about
your
panjika
lunar
calendar
and
they
showed
how
unwieldy
it
is
compared
to
the
solar
calendar
the
arabs
and
europeans
use
a
cycle
of
the
moon
does
divide
evenly
into
the
days
in
a
year
so
your
astrologers
have
to
keep
adding
and
subtracting
days
and
months
to
keep
years
the
same
length
it
almost
impossible
to
relate
a
lunar
calendar
accurately
to
a
solar
year
jamshid
beg
the
astronomer
from
samarkand
loved
to
check
out
the
predictions
in
the
hindu
panjika
if
i
deciphered
his
calculations
right
this
is
one
eclipse
the
panjika
called
wrong
the
astrologer
must
have
miscopied
his
calculations
or
maybe
he
just
bungled
one
of
the
main
rules
of
lunar
bookkeeping
solar
days
begin
at
sunrise
but
lunar
days
are
different
the
moon
can
rise
at
any
time
of
day
according
to
the
system
the
lunar
day
current
at
sunrise
is
supposed
to
be
the
day
that
counted
but
if
the
moon
rises
just
after
sunrise
and
sets
before
sunrise
the
next
day
then
that
whole
lunar
day
has
to
be
dropped
from
the
count
today
was
one
of
those
days
it
should
have
been
dropped
from
the
lunar
calendar
but
it
was
so
the
prediction
in
the
panjika
is
a
day
off
according
to
jamshid
beg
calculations
at
least
god
help
me
if
he
was
wrong
tell
him
his
panjika
is
false
if
i
to
be
killed
the
day
of
the
eclipse
he
must
kill
me
now
today
raj
singh
listened
with
increasing
disquiet
as
vasant
rao
translated
he
glanced
nervously
at
the
brahmins
and
then
replied
in
a
low
voice
vasant
rao
turned
to
hawksworth
he
asks
what
proof
you
have
of
your
forecast
hawksworth
looked
around
what
proof
could
there
be
of
an
impending
eclipse
my
word
is
my
word
another
exchange
followed
he
is
most
doubtful
you
are
wiser
than
the
panjika
vasant
rao
paused
for
a
moment
then
continued
i
am
doubtful
as
well
he
says
that
if
you
have
invented
a
lie
you
are
very
foolish
and
we
will
all
soon
know
tell
him
he
can
believe
as
he
chooses
the
eclipse
will
be
today
again
there
was
an
exchange
then
vasant
rao
turned
to
hawksworth
a
mystified
expression
on
his
face
he
says
if
what
you
say
is
true
then
you
are
an
the
incarnation
of
a
god
if
the
eclipse
is
today
as
you
say
then
the
village
must
begin
to
prepare
immediately
people
must
all
move
indoors
once
more
is
what
you
say
true
it
true
hawksworth
strained
to
keep
his
voice
confident
and
his
eyes
on
the
rajput
chieftain
as
he
spoke
it
does
matter
whether
he
believes
or
not
raj
singh
consulted
again
with
the
brahmin
priests
who
had
now
gathered
around
they
shifted
nervously
and
several
spat
to
emphasize
their
skepticism
then
the
rajput
leader
returned
and
spoke
again
to
vasant
rao
he
says
that
he
will
take
the
precaution
of
ordering
the
high
castes
indoors
if
what
you
say
comes
to
pass
then
you
have
saved
the

of
criminal
untouchables
as
the
smoke
from
the
funeral
pyre
continued
to
drift
through
the
village
the

entered

hawksworth
suddenly
found
himself
without
guards
and
he
wandered
back
to
the
square
to
look
once
more
at
the
pit
where
the
funeral
pyre
had
been
all
that
remained

were
charred
skeletons
an
hour

was

there
death

is

he
knelt
down
beside

pit
to
look
at
death
and
to
wait
chapter
fifteen
prince
jadar
passed
the
signal
to
the
waiting
guards
as
he
strode
briskly
down
the
hallway
and
they
nodded
imperceptibly
in
acknowledgment
there
was
no
sound
in
the
corridor
save
the
pad
of
his
riding
slippers
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
third
midday
and
he
had
come
directly
from
the
hunt
when
the
runner
brought
word
that
mumtaz
had
entered
labor
it
would
have
been
unseemly
to
have
gone
to
her
side
so
he
had
spoken
briefly
with
the
midwife
he
had
overruled
the
hindu
woman
suggestion
that
mumtaz
be
made
to
give
birth
squatting
by
a
bed
so
that
a
broom
could
be
pressed
against
her
abdomen
as
the
midwife
rubbed
her
back
it
was
he
knew
the
barbarous
practice
of
unbelievers
and
he
cursed
himself
for
taking
on
the
woman
in
the
first
place
it
had
been
a
symbolic
gesture
for
the
hindu
troops
to
quell
concern
that
all
the
important
details
attending
the
birth
would
be
muslim
jadar
had
insisted
that
mumtaz
be
moved
to
a
velvet
mat
on
the
floor
of
her
room
and
carefully
positioned
with
her
head
north
and
her
feet
south
in
case
she
should
die
in
childbirth
and
he
fervently
prayed
she
would
not
this
was
the
position
in
which
she
would
be
buried
her
face
directed
toward
mecca
he
had
ordered
all
cannon
of
the
fort
primed
with
powder
to
be
fired
in
the
traditional
muslim
salute
if
a
male
child
was
the
issue
preparations
also
were
underway
for
the
naming
ceremony
he
had
prayed
for
many
days
that
this
time
a
son
would
be
named
there
were
two
daughters
already
and
yet
another
would
merely
mean
one
more
intriguing
woman
to
be
locked
away
forever
for
he
knew
he
could
never
allow
a
daughter
to
marry
the
complications
of
yet
another
aspiring
family
in
the
palace
circle
were
inconceivable
the
scheming
persian
like
the
queen
and
her
family
who
had
descended
on
agra
would
like
nothing
better
than
another
opportunity
to
use
marriage
to
dilute
the
influence
of
sunni
muslims
at
court
allah
this
time
it
has
to
be
a
son
has
everything
possible
been
done
and
if
akman
was
right
that
a
change
of
residence
during
the
term
ensures
a
male
heir
then
i
have
a
son
twelve
times
over
from
this
birthing
she
been
in
a
dozen
cities
and
camps
i
even
tested
the
augury
of
the
hindus
and
had
a
household
snake
killed
and
tossed
in
the
air
by
one
of
their
brahmin
unbelievers
to
see
how
it
would
land
and
it
landed
on
its
back
which
they
say
augurs
a
boy
also
the
milk
squeezed
from
her
breasts
three
days
ago
was
thin
which
the
hindus
believe
foretells
a
son
still
the
omens
have
been
mixed
why
did
it
come
a
day
earlier
than
the
hindu
astrologers
had
predicted
now
i
realize
it
was
exactly
seven
days
before
the
birth
no
one
can
recall
when
they
failed
to
compute
an
eclipse
correctly
what
did
it
mean
that
my
line
will
die
out
or
that
a
son
will
be
born
here
who
will
one
day
overshadow
me
who
can
know
the
future
what
allah
wills
must
be
and
he
told
himself
the
meeting
set
for
the
third
must
still
take
place
regardless
of
the
birth
unless
he
did
what
he
had
planned
the
birth
would
be
meaningless
all
the
years
of
planning
now
could
be
forfeited
in
this
single
campaign
if
i
fail
now
what
will
happen
to
the
legacy
of
akman
his
great
work
to
unify
india
will
india
return
to
warring
fiefdoms
neighbor
pitted
against
neighbor
or
fall
to
the
the
very
air
around
me
hints
of
treachery
with
that
thought
he
momentarily
inspected
the
placement
of
his
personal
crest
on
the
thick
wooden
door
of
the
fortress
reception
hall
and
pushed
it
wide
a
phalanx
of
guards
trailed
behind
him
into
the
room
which
he
had
claimed
as
his
command
post
for
the
duration
of
his
stay
in
burhanpur
the
immense
central
carpet
had
been
freshly
garlanded
around
the
edges
with
flowers
the
fortress
the
only
secure
post
remaining
in
the
city
had
been
commandeered
by
jadar
and
his
guard
his
officers
had
taken
accommodations
in
the
town
and
the
troops
had
erected
an
enormous
tent
complex
along
the
road
leading
into
the
city
from
the
north
their
women
now
swarmed
over
the
bazaar
accumulating
stores
for
the
march
south
bullock
carts
of
fresh
produce
glutted
the
roads
leading
into
the
city
for
word
had
reached
the
surrounding
villages
that
burhanpur
was
host
to
the
retinue
of
the
prince
and
his
soldiers
from
the
north
buyers
accustomed
to
high
northern
prices
the
villagers
also
knew
from
long
experience
that
a
wise
man
would
strip
his
fields
and
gardens
and
orchards
now
and
sell
before
an
army
on
the
march
simply
took
what
it
wanted
rumors
had
already
reached
the
city
that
the
army
of
malik
ambar
abyssinian
leader
of
the
deccanis
was
marching
north
toward
burhanpur
with
eighty
thousand
infantry
and
horsemen
an
advance
contingent
was
already
encamped
no
more
than
ten
south
of
the
city
jadar
inspected
the
reception
room
until
he
was
certain
it
was
secure
with
every
doorway
under
command
of
his
men
then
he
signaled
the
leader
of
the
rajput
guard
who
relayed
a
message
to
a
courier
waiting
outside
finally
he
settled
himself
against
an
immense
velvet
bolster
relishing
this
moment
of
quiet
to
clear
his
mind
the
deccan
the
central
plains
of
india
will
they
ever
be
ours
how
many
more
campaigns
must
there
be
he
recalled
with
chagrin
all
the
humiliations
dealt
arangbar
by
the
deccanis
when
arangbar
took
the
throne
at
akman
death
he
had
announced
he
would
continue
his
father
policy
of
military
control
of
the
deccan
a
general
named
ghulam
adl
had
requested
and
received
confirmation
of
his
existing
post
of
khan
khanan
khan
of
khans
the
supreme
commander
of
the
moghul
armies
in
the
south
to
subdue
the
deccan
once
and
for
all
arangbar
had
sent
an
additional
twelve
thousand
cavalry
south
and
had
given
ghulam
adl
a
million
rupees
to
refurbish
his
army
but
in
spite
of
these
forces
the
abyssinian
malik
ambar
soon
had
set
up
a
rebel
capital
at
ahmadnagar
and
declared
himself
prime
minister
in
disgust
arangbar
had
taken
the
command
from
ghulam
adl
and
given
it
to
his
own
son
the
second
oldest
parwaz
this
dissolute
prince
marched
south
with
great
pomp
once
there
he
set
up
an
extravagant
military
headquarters
a
royal
court
in
miniature
and
spent
several
years
drinking
and
bragging
of
his
inevitable
victory
ghulam
adl
had
watched
this
with
growing
resentment
and
finally
he
succumbed
to
bribes
by
malik
ambar
and
retreated
with
his
own
army
in
anger
arangbar
then
appointed
two
other
generals
to
march
on
the
deccan
one
from
the
north
and
one
from
the
west
hoping
to
trap
malik
ambar
in
a
pincer
but
the
abyssinian
deftly
kept
them
apart
and
badly
defeated
each
in
turn
eventually
both
were
driven
back
to
the
north
with
heavy
losses
this
time
on
the
advice
of
queen
janahara
arangbar
transferred
his
son
parwaz
out
of
the
deccan
to
allahbad
and
in
his
place
sent
prince
jadar
the
younger
prince
had
marched
on
the
deccan
with
forty
thousand
additional
troops
to
supplement
the
existing
forces
when
jadar
and
his
massive
army
reached
burhanpur
malik
ambar
wisely
proposed
a
truce
and
negotiations
he
returned
the
fort
at
ahmadnagar
to
the
moghul
and
withdrew
his
troops
arangbar
was
jubilant
and
rewarded
jadar
with
sixteen
of
rupees
and
a
prize
diamond
triumphant
jadar
had
returned
to
agra
and
begun
to
think
of
becoming
the
next
moghul
that
had
been
three
long
years
ago
but
malik
ambar
had
the
cunning
of
a
jackal
and
his
surrender
had
been
merely
a
ruse
to
remove
the
moghul
troops
again
to
the
north
this
year
he
had
waited
for
the
monsoon
when
conventional
armies
could
not
move
rapidly
and
again
risen
in
rebellion
easily
driving
ghulam
army
north
from
ahmadnagar
reclaiming
the
city
and
laying
siege
to
its
moghul
garrison
the
despairing
arangbar
again
appealed
to
jadar
to
lead
troops
south
to
relieve
the
permanent
forces
of
ghulam
adl
after
demanding
and
receiving
a
substantial
increase
in
and
personal
cavalry
jadar
had
agreed
the
wide
wooden
door
of
the
reception
hall
opened
and
ghulam
adl
strode
regally
into
the
room
wearing
a
braided
turban
with
a
feather
and
a
great
sword
at
his
belt
his
beard
was
longer
than
jadar
had
remembered
and
now
it
had
been
reddened
with
henna
perhaps
jadar
thought
to
hide
the
gray
but
his
eyes
were
still
haughty
and
and
his
swagger
seemed
to
belie
reports
he
had
barely
escaped
with
his
life
from
the
besieged
fortress
at
ahmadnagar
only
five
weeks
before
ghulam
adl
gaze
quickly
swept
the
room
but
his
eyes
betrayed
no
notice
of
the
exceptional
size
of
jadar
guard
with
an
immense
show
of
dignity
he
nodded
a
perfunctory
bow
hands
clasped
at
the
sparkling
jewel
of
his
turban
salaam
highness
may
allah
lay
his
hand
on
both
our
swords
and
temper
them
once
more
with
fire
he
seated
himself
easily
as
he
might
with
an
equal
and
when
no
servant
came
forward
he
poured
himself
a
glass
of
wine
from
the
decanter
that
waited
on
the
carpet
beside
his
bolster
is
there
anything
he
wondered
i
despise
more
than
these
presumptuous
young
princes
from
agra
i
rejoice
your
journey
was
swift
arrived
in
time
to
witness
my
army
savage
the
abyssinian
unbeliever
and
his
rabble
how
many
troops
are
left
jadar
seemed
not
to
hear
the
boast
waiting
are
fifty
thousand
men
highness
and
twenty
thousand
horse
ready
to
tender
their
lives
at
my
command
ghulam
adl
delicately
shielded
his
beard
as
he
drank
off
the
glass
of
wine
and
when
again
no
servant
appeared
poured
himself
another
jadar
remained
expressionless
my
reports
give
you
only
five
thousand
men
left
most
chelas
from
the
hindu
slang
for
slave
was
a
reference
to
the
mercenary
troops
taken
in
childhood
and
raised
in
the
camp
that
commanders
maintained
as
a
kernel
of
their
forces
unlike
soldiers
from
the
villages
they
were
loyal
even
in
misfortune
because
they
literally
had
no
place
to
return
to
what
troops
do
you
have
from
the
who
been
granted
stipends
from
their
estate
revenue
to
maintain
men
and
horse
those
were
the
ones
i
mean
highness
ghulam
adl
hand
trembled
slightly
as
he
again
lifted
the
wineglass
the
have
assured
me
we
have
only
to
sound
the
call
and
their
men
will
muster
in
due
time
then
pay
is
not
in
arrears
for
their
men
and
cavalry
highness
it
well
known
pay
must
always
be
in
arrears
how
else
are
men
loyalties
to
be
guaranteed
a
commander
foolish
enough
to
pay
his
troops
on
time
will
lose
them
at
the
slightest
setback
since
they
have
no
reason
to
remain
with
him
in
adversity
ghulam
adl
eased
his
wineglass
on
the
carpet
and
bent
forward
i
concede
some
of
the
may
have
allowed
matters
of
pay
to
slip
longer
than
is
wise
but
they
assure
me
that
when
the
time
is
right
their
men
will
muster
nonetheless
then
why
not
call
the
muster
in
another
twenty
days
ambar
troops
will
be
encamped
at
our
doorstep
he
could
well
control
all
lands
south
of
the
narbada
river
and
that
ghulam
adl
smiled
to
himself
is
precisely
the
plan
he
thought
of
the
arrangement
that
had
been
worked
out
jadar
was
to
be
kept
in
burhanpur
for
another
three
weeks
delayed
by
any
means
possible
by
then
malik
ambar
would
have
the
city
surrounded
all
access
cut
off
the
imperial
troops
would
be
isolated
and
demoralized
no
troops
would
be
forthcoming
from
the
only
promises
of
troops
cut
off
from
agra
and
provisions
jadar
would
have
no
choice
but
to
sign
a
treaty
the
paper
had
already
been
prepared
malik
ambar
would
rule
the
deccan
from
his
new
capital
at
ahmadnagar
and
ghulam
adl
would
be
appointed
governor
of
all
provinces
north
from
ahmadnagar
to
the
narbada
river
with
their
combined
troops
holding
the
borders
no
moghul
army
could
ever
again
challenge
the
deccan
ghulam
adl
knew
the
would
support
him
because
he
had
offered
to
cut
their
taxes
in
half
he
had
neglected
to
specify
for
how
long
i
respectfully
submit
the
time
for
muster
is
premature
highness
crops
are
not
yet
in
the
revenues
of
the
estates
will
suffer
if
men
are
called
now
ghulam
adl
shifted
uncomfortably
they
have
no
revenues
at
all
if
they
do
muster
immediately
confiscate
the
of
any
who
has
not
mustered
his
men
and
cavalry
within
seven
days
jadar
watched
ghulam
adl
throat
muscles
tense
and
he
asked
himself
if
a
granted
by
the
moghul
could
be
legally
confiscated
probably
not
but
the
threat
would
serve
to
reveal
loyalties
and
reveal
them
quickly
but
there
no
possible
way
to
pay
the
men
now
highness
ghulam
adl
easily
retained
his
poise
hold
firm
and
this
aspiring
young
upstart
will
waver
and
then
agree
give
him
numbers
first
make
it
sound
hopeless
then
show
him
a
way
he
can
still
win
there
not
enough
silver
in
all
the
deccan
let
me
give
you
some
idea
of
the
problem
assume
it
would
require
a
year
back
pay
to
muster
the
troops
not
unreasonable
since
most
of
the
are
at
least
two
years
behind
now
the
usual
yearly
allowance
for
cavalry
here
is
three
hundred
rupees
for
a
muslim
and
two
hundred
and
forty
for
a
hindu
you
will
certainly
need
to
raise
a
minimum
of
thirty
thousand
men
from
the
assuming
some
loyal
troops
might
possibly
muster
on
notes
of
promise
you
still
need
almost
fifty
of
rupees
an
impossible
sum
it
clear
the
wo
have
the
revenues
to
pay
their
men
until
the
fall
crops
are
harvested
then
i
confiscate
their
now
and
pay
the
troops
myself
and
deduct
the
sum
from
their
next
revenues
that
impossible
the
money
is
nowhere
to
be
found
ghulam
adl
realized
with
relief
that
jadar
was
bluffing
the
prince
could
not
possibly
raise
the
money
needed
he
shifted
closer
and
smiled
warmly
but
listen
carefully
if
we
wait
but
two
months
everything
will
be
changed
then
it
be
simple
to
squeeze
the
revenue
from
the
and
we
can
pay
the
men
ourselves
if
we
need
until
then
we
can
easily
contain
the
abyssinian
and
his
rabble
perhaps
we
could
raise
a
few
men
and
horse
from
the
now
but
frankly
i
advise
against
it
why
trouble
them
yet
with
the
troops
we
have
we
can
keep
malik
ambar
diverted
for
weeks
months
even
then
when
the
time
is
right
we
sound
the
call
march
south
with
our
combined
forces
and
drive
him
into
the
southern
jungles
forever
but
that
call
will
raise
no
men
ghulam
adl
told
himself
not
a
single
wagon
driver
it
has
been
agreed
we
wait
a
few
weeks
until
ambar
has
his
supply
lines
extended
then
we
begin
to
harass
him
in
no
time
he
begin
to
fall
back
to
ahmadnagar
to
wait
for
winter
and
by
that
time
we
have
our
full
strength
we
march
in
force
and
crush
him
i
lead
the
men
personally
you
need
never
leave
burhanpur
highness
he
took
another
sip
of
wine
though
i
daresay
its
pleasures
must
seem
rustic
for
one
accustomed
to
the
more
luxurious
diversions
of
agra
jadar
examined
the
commander
and
a
slight
knowing
smile
played
across
his
lips
let
me
propose
a
slight
alternative
he
began
evenly
i
will
lead
the
army
this
time
and
you
will
remain
here
at
the
fortress
i
called
you
here
today
to
notify
you
that
as
of
this
moment
you
are
relieved
of
your
command
and
confined
to
the
fort
jadar
watched
ghulam
adl
stiffen
and
his
sly
grin
freeze
on
his
face
i
will
assemble
the
army
myself
and
march
south
in
ten
days
this
is
a
weak
jest
highness
ghulam
adl
tried
to
laugh
no
one
knows
the
deccan
the
way
i
and
my
commanders
know
it
the
terrain
is
treacherous
your
knowledge
of
the
terrain
admittedly
is
excellent
you
and
your
commanders
have
retreated
the
length
of
the
deccan
year
after
year
this
time
i
will
use
my
own
generals
abdullah
khan
will
command
the
advance
guard
with
three
thousand
horse
from
our
own
troops
abul
hasan
will
take
the
left
flank
and
raja
vikramajit
the
right
i
will
personally
command
the
center
jadar
fixed
ghulam
adl
squarely
you
will
be
confined
to
the
fort
where
you
send
no
ciphers
to
ambar
your
remaining
troops
will
be
divided
and
put
under
our
command
you
will
order
it
in
writing
today
and
i
will
send
the
dispatches
for
your
sake
i
trust
this
is
a
jest
highness
you
dare
not
carry
it
out
ghulam
adl
slammed
his
glass
onto
the
carpet
spilling
his
wine
the
rajputs
around
jadar
stiffened
but
made
no
move
i
have
the
full
support
of
the
moghul
himself
your
current
position
in
agra
is
already
talked
about
here
in
the
south
do
you
think
we
so
far
away
we
hear
nothing
your
return
this
time
if
you
are
allowed
to
return
will
be
nothing
like
the
grand
celebrations
three
years
ago
if
i
were
you
be
marching
back
now
leave
the
deccan
to
those
who
know
it
you
right
about
agra
on
one
point
it
is
far
away
and
this
campaign
is
mine
not
the
moghul
you
never
raise
the
troops
young
prince
only
i
can
induce
the
to
muster
i
muster
the
men
with
full
pay
you
muster
nothing
highness
you
be
ambar
prisoner
inside
a
month
i
can
swear
it
if
you
are
still
alive
ghulam
adl
bowed
low
and
his
hand
shot
for
his
sword
by
the
time
it
touched
the
handle
the
rajputs
were
there
he
was
circled
by
drawn
blades
jadar
watched
impassively
for
a
moment
and
then
signaled
the
guards
to
escort
ghulam
adl
from
the
audience
room
i
see
you
dead
he
shouted
over
his
shoulder
as
the
men
dragged
him
toward
the
door
within
the
month
jadar
watched
ghulam
adl
turban
disappear
through
the
torchlit
opening
and
down
the
corridor
his
sword
remained
on
the
carpet
where
it
had
been
removed
by
the
rajput
guards
jadar
stared
at
it
for
a
moment
admiring
the
silver
trim
along
the
handle
and
it
reminded
him
of
the
silver
shipment
and
the
englishman
vasant
rao
blundered
badly
with
the
english
captain
he
should
have
found
a
way
to
disarm
him
in
advance
always
disarm
a
their
instincts
are
too
erratic
the
whole
scenario
fell
apart
after
he
killed
the
headman
of
the
dynasty
my
rajput
games
almost
became
a
war
but
what
happened
in
the
village
did
the
work
sorcery
why
was
the
caravan
released
so
suddenly
the
horsemen
i
had
massed
in
the
valley
in
case
of
an
emergency
panicked
after
the
eclipse
began
they
became
just
so
many
terrified
hindus
then
suddenly
the
caravan
assembled
and
left
with
rajputs
from
the
village
riding
guard
escorting
them
all
the
way
back
to
the
river
and
even
now
vasant
rao
refuses
to
talk
about
what
really
happened
it
seems
his
honor
is
too
besmirched
he
refuses
even
to
eat
with
the
other
men
allah
the
merciful
rajputs
and
their
cursed
honor
but
i
learned
what
i
need
to
know
about
the
english
his
nerve
is
astonishing
how
could
he
dare
refuse
to
attend
my
morning
durbar
audience
in
the
reception
room
should
i
accept
his
claim
that
he
an
ambassador
and
therefore
i
should
come
to
him
should
i
simply
have
him
brought
before
me
no
i
have
a
better
idea
but
tomorrow
after
the
child
is
born
and
i
sent
runners
to
the
a
member
of
mumtaz
guard
burst
through
the
doorway
then
remembered
himself
and
salaamed
deeply
to
the
prince
guards
around
jadar
already
had
their
swords
half
drawn
forgive
a
fool
highness
he
fell
to
his
knees
just
in
case
ordered
to
report
that
your
son
is
born
the
says
he
perfectly
formed
and
has
the
lungs
of
a
cavalry
commander
cheers
swept
the
room
and
the
air
blossomed
with
flying
turbans
jadar
motioned
the
terrified
man
closer
and
he
nervously
knelt
again
this
time
directly
before
jadar
the
respectfully
asks
if
it
would
please
your
highness
to
witness
the
ceremony
she
suggests
a
gold
knife
instead
of
the
usual
silver
jadar
barely
heard
the
words
but
he
did
recall
that
tradition
allowed
the
midwife
to
keep
the
knife
she
can
have
her
knife
of
gold
and
you
are
granted
a
thousand
gold
but
the
cord
will
be
cut
with
a
string
this
ceremony
must
be
a
signal
to
all
india
jadar
told
himself
and
he
tried
to
recall
exactly
the
tradition
started
by
akman
for
newborn
moghul
princes
the
birth
cord
of
all
akman
three
sons
was
cut
with
a
silken
string
then
placed
in
a
velvet
bag
with
writings
from
the
quran
and
kept
under
the
new
child
pillow
for
forty
days
the
guard
salaamed
once
more
his
face
in
the
carpet
and
then
scurried
toward
the
door
praising
allah
as
jadar
rose
and
made
his
way
toward
the
corridor
a
chant
of
jadar
is
great
rose
from
the
cheering
rajputs
every
man
knew
that
with
an
heir
the
prince
was
at
last
ready
to
claim
his
birthright
and
they
would
fight
beside
him
for
it
mumtaz
lay
against
a
bolster
a
fresh
scarf
tied
around
her
head
and
a
roller
bound
about
her
abdomen
taking
a
draft
of
strong
scented
asafetida
gum
as
jadar
came
into
the
room
he
immediately
knew
she
was
well
for
this
precaution
was
taken
only
after
the
placenta
was
expelled
and
the
mother
assured
next
to
her
side
was
a
box
of
betel
leaves
rolled
especially
with
myrrh
to
purge
the
taste
of
the
asafetida
my
congratulations
highness
the
salaamed
awkwardly
from
the
bedside
may
it
please
you
to
know
the
child
is
blind
of
an
eye
jadar
stared
at
her
dumbfounded
then
remembered
she
was
a
local
hindu
midwife
from
gujarat
province
where
the
birth
of
a
boy
is
never
spoken
of
lest
the
gods
grow
jealous
of
the
parents
good
fortune
and
loose
the
evil
eye
instead
boys
were
announced
by
declaring
the
child
blind
in
one
eye
no
precautions
against
divine
jealousy
were
thought
necessary
for
a
girl
child
a
financial
liability
no
plausible
god
would
covet
the
returned
to
washing
mumtaz
breasts
stroking
them
carefully
with
wet
blades
of
grass
jadar
knew
this
local
ritual
was
believed
to
ensure
fortune
for
the
child
and
he
did
not
interrupt
he
merely
returned
mumtaz
weak
smile
and
strode
to
the
silver
basin
resting
by
the
bedside
where
another
midwife
was
washing
his
new
son
in
a
murky
mixture
of
gram
flour
and
water
the
frightened
woman
dried
off
the
child
brushed
his
head
with
perfumed
oil
and
placed
him
on
a
thin
pillow
of
quilted
calico
for
jadar
to
see
he
was
red
and
wrinkled
and
his
dark
eyes
were
startled
but
he
was
a
prince
jadar
touched
the
infant
warm
hand
as
he
examined
him
for
imperfections
there
were
none
someday
my
first
son
you
may
rule
india
as
moghul
if
we
both
live
that
long
is
he
well
mumtaz
spoke
at
last
her
normally
shrill
voice
now
scarcely
above
a
whisper
are
you
pleased
he
do
for
now
jadar
smiled
as
he
examined
her
tired
face
she
had
never
seemed
as
beautiful
as
she
did
at
this
moment
he
knew
there
was
no
way
he
could
ever
show
his
great
love
for
her
but
he
knew
she
understood
and
returned
it
do
these
unbelievers
know
enough
to
follow
muslim
tradition
yes
a
mullah
has
been
summoned
to
sound
the
the
call
to
prayer
in
his
ear
but
a
male
child
must
first
be
announced
with
artillery
so
never
be
afraid
to
fight
jadar
was
sure
how
much
belief
he
put
in
all
these
muslim
traditions
but
the
troops
expected
it
and
every
ceremony
for
this
prince
had
to
be
observed
lest
superstitions
begin
that
he
was
somehow
superstitions
are
impossible
to
bury
this
one
is
a
prince
he
will
be
greeted
with
cannon
then
immediately
have
his
horoscope
cast
for
the
hindu
troops
and
schedule
his
naming
ceremony
for
the
believers
what
will
you
name
him
his
first
name
will
be
nushirvan
you
can
pick
the
others
nushirvan
was
a
haughty
persian
king
and
it
an
ugly
name
it
the
name
i
chosen
jadar
smiled
wickedly
still
mulling
over
what
name
he
would
eventually
pick
mumtaz
did
not
argue
she
had
already
selected
the
name
salaman
the
handsome
young
man
persian
legends
said
was
once
created
by
a
wise
magician
salaman
was
an
ideal
lover
whatever
name
jadar
chose
salaman
would
be
his
second
name
and
the
one
she
would
call
him
all
the
coming
years
in
the
when
he
would
creep
into
her
bed
after
jadar
had
departed
for
his
own
quarters
and
we
see
what
name
he
answers
to
seven
years
hence
on
his
circumcision
day
the
busy
spooning
a
mixture
of
honey
ghee
and
opium
into
the
child
mouth
then
a
drop
of
milk
was
pressed
from
mumtaz
breast
and
rubbed
on
the
breast
of
the
wet
nurse
jadar
watched
the
ritual
with
approval
now
for
the
most
important
tradition
the
one
begun
by
akman
is
the
wrap
ready
akman
had
believed
that
the
first
clothes
a
moghul
prince
wore
should
be
fashioned
from
an
old
garment
of
a
muslim
holy
man
and
he
had
requested
a
garment
from
the
revered
sayyid
ali
shjirazi
for
his
first
son
the
custom
had
become
fixed
for
the
royal
family
it
here
the
woman
in
surat
heard
a
child
was
due
and
had
this
sent
to
me
in
agra
before
we
left
she
pointed
to
a
folded
loincloth
which
had
been
washed
to
a
perfect
white
it
was
once
worn
by
that
sufi
you
adore
samad
good
i
glad
it
from
samad
but
what
woman
in
surat
do
you
mean
you
know
who
she
is
mumtaz
looked
around
the
crowded
room
and
switched
from
turki
to
persian
she
sent
the
weekly
reports
of
mukarrab
khan
affairs
and
handled
all
the
payments
to
those
who
collected
information
in
surat
jadar
nodded
almost
imperceptibly
that
one
of
course
i
remember
her
her
reports
were
always
more
reliable
than
the
shahbandar
i
find
i
can
never
trust
any
number
that
thief
gives
me
i
always
have
to
ask
myself
what
he
would
wish
it
to
be
and
then
adjust
but
what
happened
to
her
i
learned
a
month
ago
that
mukarrab
khan
was
being
sent
to
goa
i
think
a
certain
woman
of
power
in
agra
finally
realized
i
was
learning
everything
that
went
on
at
the
port
before
she
was
and
thought
mukarrab
khan
had
betrayed
her
the
surat
woman
did
go
to
goa
with
mukarrab
khan
she
made
him
divorce
her
it
was
a
scandal
mumtaz
smiled
mysteriously
you
should
come
to
the
women
quarters
more
often
and
learn
the
news
but
what
happened
to
her
there
a
rumor
in
surat
that
the
shahbandar
mirza
nuruddin
is
hiding
her
in
the
women
quarters
of
his
estate
house
but
actually
she
left
for
agra
the
next
day
by
the
northern
road
i
very
worried
what
may
happen
to
her
there
how
do
you
know
all
this
it
sounds
like
bazaar
gossip
it
all
true
enough
she
sent
a
pigeon
to
the
fortress
here
the
message
was
waiting
when
we
arrived
it
good
she
out
of
surat
with
mukarrab
khan
gone
she
no
longer
any
help
there
but
i
always
wanted
to
thank
her
somehow
she
one
of
the
best
and
our
only
woman
i
do
think
anyone
ever
guessed
what
she
really
did
i
will
thank
her
for
you
her
message
was
a
request
something
only
i
could
arrange
a
favor
for
a
favor
and
what
was
that
just
something
between
women
my
love
nothing
to
do
with
armies
and
wars
mumtaz
shifted
on
the
bolster
and
took
a
perfumed
pan
allah
i
tired
jadar
studied
her
face
again
marveling
as
always
how
it
seemed
to
attest
to
her
spirit
then
rest
i
hope
the
cannon
wo
disturb
you
it
should
have
been
another
girl
then
there
be
no
cannon
and
no
heir
jadar
turned
to
leave
and
mumtaz
eased
herself
back
on
the
bolster
then
she
lifted
herself
again
and
called
jadar
who
is
escorting
the
english
to
agra
unfortunately
it
vasant
rao
and
just
when
i
need
him
but
he
demanded
to
do
it
personally
i
glad
mumtaz
smiled
weakly
have
him
see
one
of
my
servants
before
they
leave
why
should
i
bother
him
with
that
to
humor
me
she
paused
is
this
handsome
why
do
you
ask
a
woman
curiosity
i
have
seen
him
yet
i
do
suspect
he
quick
perhaps
too
quick
but
i
find
out
more
tomorrow
and
then
i
decide
what
i
have
to
do
jadar
paused
at
the
doorway
while
the
dai
pulled
aside
the
curtains
that
had
been
newly
hung
sleep
and
watch
over
my
new
prince
he
our
first
victory
in
the
deccan
i
pray
to
allah
he
not
our
last
he
turned
and
was
gone
minutes
later
the
cannon
salutes
began
hawksworth
began
to
count
the
stone
stairs
after
the
third
twisting
turn
of
the
descending
corridor
and
his
eyes
searched
through
the
smoke
and
flickering
torchlight
for
some
order
in
the
arched
doorways
that
opened
out
on
each
level
as
they
went
farther
and
farther
down
ail
object
struck
him
across
the
face
and
his
hand
plunged
for
his
sword
before
he
remembered
he
had
left
it
in
his
quarters
on
jadar
command
then
he
heard
the
shriek
of
a
bat
and
saw
it
flutter
into
the
shadows
the
torchbearers
were
ten
rajputs
of
jadar
personal
guard
armed
with
the
usual
swords
and
none
spoke
as
their
footsteps
clattered
through
the
musty
subterranean
air
hawksworth
felt
the
dankness
against
the
beads
of
sweat
forming
on
his
skin
as
the
old
memory
of
a
dark
prison
welled
up
he
suddenly
realized
he
was
terrified
why
did
i
agree
to
meet
him
here
this
is
not
the
lower
level
of
the
fortress
this
is
a
dungeon
but
he
ca
detain
me
not
with
a
safe
conduct
pass
from
the
moghul
still
he
might
try
if
he
wants
to
keep
me
out
of
agra
while
he
away
on
campaign
and
he
may
i
already
smell
this
campaign
is
doomed
it
was
the
evening
of
hawksworth
third
day
in
the
burhanpur
fortress
when
the
convoy
arrived
at
the
village
of
bahadurpur
three
west
of
burhanpur
they
had
been
met
by
jadar
personal
guards
and
escorted
through
the
city
and
into
the
walled
compound
of
the
fortress
he
had
been
given
spacious
carpeted
quarters
always
guarded
and
had
seen
no
one
not
even
vasant
rao
communications
with
jadar
had
been
by
courier
and
finally
they
had
agreed
on
a
neutral
meeting
place
jadar
had
suggested
a
location
in
the
palace
where
they
would
have
privacy
yet
be
outside
his
official
quarters
since
they
would
meet
as
officials
of
state
jadar
had
insisted
on
no
weapons
no
visible
weapons
hawksworth
told
himself
glad
he
wore
boots
the
corridor
narrowed
slightly
then
ended
abruptly
at
a
heavy
wooden
door
iron
braces
were
patterned
over
the
face
of
the
door
and
in
its
center
was
a
small
window
secured
with
heavy
bars
armed
rajputs
stood
on
either
side
and
as
hawksworth
party
approached
they
snapped
about
hands
at
their
swords
then
the
leader
of
hawksworth
guards
spoke
through
the
air
his
voice
echoing
off
the
stone
walls
krishna
plays
his
flute
a
voice
came
from
the
sentries
at
the
door
and
longing
burn
again
hawksworth
guard
with
a
maid
desire
immediately
the
sentries
slid
back
the
ancient
iron
bolt
that
spanned
the
face
of
the
door
then
came
the
rasping
scrape
of
another
bolt
on
the
inside
being
released
when
he
heard
the
sound
hawksworth
felt
a
surge
of
fear
and
stared
around
wildly
at
the
faces
of
the
guards
they
all
stood
menacingly
with
a
regal
bearing
and
expressionless
faces
each
man
had
his
hand
loosely
on
his
sword
the
door
creaked
slowly
inward
and
hawksworth
realized
it
was
almost
a
foot
thick
and
probably
weighed
tons
the
guards
motioned
him
forward
and
stood
stiffly
waiting
for
him
to
move
he
calculated
his
chances
one
more
time
and
with
a
shrug
walked
through
the
room
was
enormous
with
a
high
vaulted
stone
ceiling
and
a
back
wall
lost
in
its
smoky
recesses
rows
of
oil
lamps
trailed
down
the
walls
on
either
side
of
the
door
the
walls
themselves
were
heavy
gray
blocks
of
cut
stone
carefully
smoothed
until
they
fit
seamlessly
together
without
mortar
he
asked
himself
how
air
reached
the
room
then
he
traced
the
lamp
smoke
upward
and
noticed
it
disappeared
through
ornate
carvings
that
decorated
the
high
roof
of
the
chamber
a
heavy
slam
echoed
off
the
walls
and
he
turned
to
see
the
door
had
been
sealed
as
his
eyes
adjusted
to
the
lamplight
he
searched
the
chamber
all
he
could
see
were
long
neat
rows
of
bundles
lining
the
length
of
the
stone
floor
with
a
shock
he
realized
they
were
the
bundles
from
the
caravan
otherwise
the
room
seemed
empty
at
that
moment
he
caught
a
flicker
of
movement
a
tall
figure
at
the
far
end
of
the
chamber
passing
shadowlike
among
the
bundles
an
apparition
then
a
voice
sounded
through
the
dense
air
at
last
we
meet
the
stone
walls
threw
back
an
eerie
echo
is
the
place
to
your
liking
i
prefer
sunlight
hawksworth
felt
the
cool
of
the
room
envelop
his
skin
where
i
can
see
who
i
talking
to
you
are
speaking
to
prince
shapur
firdawsi
jadar
third
son
of
the
moghul
it
customary
to
salaam
general
hawksworth
i
speak
for
his
majesty
king
james
the
first
of
england
the
sons
of
kings
normally
bow
before
him
when
i
meet
him
perhaps
i
will
bow
jadar
emerged
from
among
the
bundles
he
had
an
elegant
short
beard
and
seemed
much
younger
somehow
than
hawksworth
had
expected
i
surprised
to
see
you
alive
captain
how
is
it
you
still
live
while
so
many
of
my
rajputs
died
i
live
by
my
wits
not
by
my
caste
jadar
roared
with
genuine
delight
spoken
like
a
moghul
then
he
sobered
you
be
wise
never
to
say
that
to
a
rajput
however
i
often
wonder
how
an
army
of
moghul
troops
would
fare
against
a
division
of
hindu
unbelievers
i
pray
to
allah
i
never
find
out
jadar
suddenly
slipped
a
dagger
from
his
waist
and
held
it
loosely
fingering
the
blade
christians
would
be
another
matter
entirely
however
did
you
come
unarmed
captain
as
we
agreed
i
did
hawksworth
stared
at
the
knife
in
dismay
come
captain
please
do
ask
me
to
believe
you
be
such
a
fool
jadar
slipped
the
dagger
into
his
other
hand
with
a
quick
twist
and
tossed
it
atop
one
of
the
bundles
but
this
meeting
must
be
held
in
trust
i
ask
that
you
leave
your
weapon
beside
mine
hawksworth
hesitated
then
slowly
reached
into
his
boot
and
withdrew
a
small
stiletto
the
portuguese
knife
left
at
the
observatory
as
he
dropped
it
beside
jadar
weapon
he
noticed
the
prince
knife
was
missing
half
its
handle
jadar
smiled
you
know
captain
if
i
killed
you
here
now
there
would
be
no
witness
to
the
deed
save
your
christian
god
do
you
plan
to
try
i
do
not
to
do
anything
captain
jadar
opened
his
hand
to
reveal
that
a
dagger
remained
it
was
the
other
side
of
his
original
knife
which
had
been
two
blades
fitted
to
appear
as
one
what
i
do
captain
is
merely
a
matter
of
what
i
decide
to
do
right
now
i
have
serious
misgivings
about
your
intentions
in
india
jadar
blade
glinted
in
the
lamplight
as
he
moved
toward
hawksworth
is
this
your
greeting
for
any
who
refuse
to
salaam
hawksworth
took
a
step
backward
toward
the
door
feinted
toward
his
boot
and
rose
with
a
cocked
pistol
leveled
directly
at
jadar
what
game
is
this
the
prince
exploded
with
laughter
and
before
hawksworth
caught
the
quick
motion
of
his
arm
the
knife
thudded
deeply
into
the
wooden
door
behind
him
well
done
captain
very
well
done
jadar
beamed
in
appreciation
you
are
as
i
suspected
truly
without
the
smallest
shred
of
rajput
honor
put
away
your
pistol
i
think
we
can
talk
and
by
the
way
there
are
twenty
matchlocks
trained
on
you
right
now
he
waved
toward
the
vaulted
ceiling
of
the
crypt
where
dark
musket
barrels
were
visible
through
slits
in
the
carved
decoration
he
barked
a
command
in
urdu
and
the
barrels
slowly
withdrew
why
do
we
talk
about
releasing
me
and
my
chest
to
travel
on
to
agra
hawksworth
lowered
the
pistol
but
kept
it
still
cocked
in
his
hand
agra
you
say
captain
there
are
already
europeans
in
agra
jadar
leaned
against
one
of
the
bundles
portuguese
they
been
there
many
years
how
many
more
christians
can
india
endure
you
infidel
europeans
are
beginning
to
annoy
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
what
do
you
mean
hawksworth
tried
to
read
jadar
eyes
remembering
shirin
story
of
the
persians
and
portuguese
both
hating
the
prince
tell
me
about
your
english
ships
captain
jadar
seemed
not
to
hear
hawksworth
question
tell
me
how
you
defeated
the
portuguese
so
easily
english
frigates
are
better
designed
than
the
portugals
galleons
and
english
seamen
are
better
gunners
and
sailors
words
captain
easy
words
perhaps
the
portuguese
allowed
themselves
to
be
defeated
this
one
time
waiting
for
a
bigger
prize
how
can
you
know
is
that
what
the
portugals
say
happened
i
asked
you
a
english
frigate
is
the
match
of
any
two
galleons
then
how
many
of
your
would
it
take
to
blockade
the
port
at
goa
hawksworth
saw
a
small
flicker
in
jadar
eyes
as
the
prince
waited
for
the
answer
i
think
a
dozen
could
do
it
if
we
caught
their
fleet
in
the
harbor
before
they
could
put
out
to
sea
christians
typically
exaggerate
their
strength
how
many
would
it
really
take
five
times
what
you
said
ten
times
i
said
it
depends
on
seamanship
and
surprise
christians
always
seem
to
have
answers
particularly
when
there
is
no
answer
jadar
turned
and
pointed
to
the
stacks
of
bundles
by
the
way
do
you
know
what
the
caravan
carried
captain
i
doubt
very
much
it
was
lead
so
it
probably
silver
hawksworth
marveled
at
the
way
jadar
seemed
to
lead
the
conversation
always
getting
what
he
wanted
before
what
he
wanted
had
become
obvious
and
then
quickly
moving
on
your
is
exactly
right
and
do
you
know
why
it
carried
silver
you
have
a
long
supply
line
you
needed
to
buy
supplies
and
arms
i
see
you
do
think
like
a
moghul
after
all
jadar
moved
closer
studying
hawksworth
eyes
why
bother
to
buy
what
i
could
easily
take
no
my
christian
captain
or
ambassador
or
spy
i
needed
men
what
is
it
about
human
character
that
allows
men
to
be
bought
like
so
many
girls
not
every
man
is
born
to
wealth
hawksworth
glared
directly
at
jadar
beginning
to
find
the
conversation
growing
sinister
and
few
men
are
without
a
price
captain
i
think
i
could
even
find
yours
if
i
looked
enough
for
it
jadar
paused
reflectively
for
a
moment
then
continued
tell
me
should
i
be
pleased
with
your
presence
here
you
have
no
reason
not
to
be
my
only
mission
here
is
to
open
trade
between
our
kings
you
know
your
has
brought
about
many
deaths
since
you
landed
in
india
the
most
recent
were
the
deaths
of
forty
of
my
best
men
i
did
order
the
attack
on
the
caravan
those
men
lives
are
on
the
head
of
whoever
did
hawksworth
stopped
and
as
he
looked
at
jadar
something
clicked
in
his
mind
something
about
the
attack
that
had
bothered
him
ever
since
your
caravan
was
attacked
by
bandits
captain
who
could
order
them
to
do
anything
but
the
men
i
provided
as
escort
gave
their
lives
protecting
you
those
men
were
murdered
they
never
had
a
chance
hawksworth
mind
was
racing
suddenly
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
began
to
fall
together
everything
fit
vasant
rao
had
been
too
nervous
he
must
have
known
the
attack
was
coming
but
not
when
it
was
all
a
game
some
deadly
serious
war
game
and
none
of
the
other
men
knew
but
i
think
i
have
an
idea
who
did
order
the
attack
hawksworth
continued
glaring
at
jadar
and
you
do
too
your
rajputs
guards
were
growing
careless
captain
they
made
a
foolish
mistake
what
commander
can
afford
men
who
make
mistakes
even
if
they
are
rajputs
all
men
grow
complacent
if
they
are
never
tested
it
was
vicious
it
was
discipline
security
has
improved
considerably
here
since
that
incident
jadar
continued
evenly
ignoring
the
look
on
face
the
only
real
difficulties
that
night
were
caused
by
you
it
was
very
imprudent
of
you
to
kill
one
of
the
bandits
with
a
pistol
they
were
instructed
merely
to
disarm
you
you
were
completely
safe
but
after
your
rash
killing
it
became
much
more
difficult
for
me
to
try
to
rescue
you
and
after
the
eclipse
it
actually
become
impossible
jadar
wanted
to
ask
hawksworth
what
had
really
happened
but
he
suppressed
the
impulse
still
after
your
first
mistake
you
appear
to
have
handled
yourself
reasonably
well
that
why
we
having
this
talk
in
a
dungeon
surrounded
by
muskets
in
a
room
surrounded
by
silver
more
i
suspect
than
you
have
ever
known
how
many
sailing
ships
your
could
be
bought
with
this
much
silver
i
do
know
exactly
i
do
know
english
frigates
are
not
for
sale
come
captain
would
you
have
me
believe
your
king
never
has
allies
who
share
a
common
cause
that
he
never
aids
those
who
war
against
his
enemies
allies
have
been
known
to
become
enemies
if
they
grow
too
ambitious
just
who
would
your
frigates
assuming
you
had
them
and
the
trained
seamen
to
man
them
be
used
against
the
portugals
or
against
the
english
eventually
sometimes
unfortunately
an
ally
becomes
a
tyrant
forcing
you
to
act
in
your
own
interest
i
know
it
all
too
well
jadar
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
smiled
smoothly
but
tell
me
about
your
plans
when
you
reach
agra
you
have
no
frigates
there
what
do
you
hope
to
gain
open
trade
that
and
nothing
more
england
wants
no
war
with
the
portugals
truly
i
believe
they
may
think
otherwise
time
will
tell
there
may
be
changes
in
agra
soon
the
christian
portuguese
may
find
their
time
has
run
out
if
that
happens
what
will
you
do
i
wait
and
see
there
may
be
no
time
to
english
captain
hawksworth
the
times
may
require
you
to
choose
if
the
portuguese
decide
to
act
in
the
interest
of
one
party
here
will
england
act
in
the
interest
of
the
other
i
want
to
know
the
king
of
england
acts
in
his
own
interest
but
your
king
will
not
be
here
you
will
be
here
then
i
will
act
in
his
interest
hawksworth
fixed
jadar
squarely
and
the
king
of
england
is
not
interested
in
who
rules
india
only
in
free
trade
between
us
but
the
one
who
rules
india
will
have
the
power
to
permit
or
deny
that
trade
you
know
there
an
indian
folk
tale
of
a
brahmin
who
once
discovered
a
tiger
in
a
well
he
gave
aid
to
the
tiger
helped
him
escape
from
the
well
and
years
later
when
the
brahmin
was
starving
the
tiger
brought
him
a
necklace
of
gold
and
jewels
won
from
a
rich
man
in
a
battle
to
the
death
do
you
understand
i
understand
but
i
still
serve
my
king
first
jadar
listened
silently
but
his
eyes
were
intent
and
that
king
is
english
for
now
jadar
filled
the
last
words
with
a
tone
of
presumption
that
left
hawksworth
uncomfortable
but
enough
let
talk
of
other
matters
i
assume
you
are
aware
the
portuguese
will
probably
try
to
have
you
assassinated
when
you
reach
agra
already
there
are
many
rumors
about
you
there
perhaps
you
should
remember
your
own
personal
interests
too
as
well
as
your
king
one
day
i
think
we
will
meet
again
if
you
are
still
alive
and
if
you
are
still
alive
jadar
smiled
lightly
we
both
difficult
to
kill
so
we
both
must
think
of
the
future
now
i
have
a
last
question
for
you
jadar
retrieved
his
knife
from
atop
the
bundles
and
deftly
ripped
open
the
side
of
one
rolls
of
new
silver
coin
glistened
in
the
light
what
do
you
see
in
this
package
ambassador
hawksworth
a
king
ransom
in
silver
i
surprised
at
you
captain
for
a
seaman
you
have
remarkably
bad
eyesight
what
you
see
here
what
came
with
you
from
surat
is
lead
captain
ingots
of
lead
that
forty
men
died
to
protect
those
men
died
protecting
you
captain
do
you
remember
your
safety
is
very
important
to
me
so
important
that
it
may
be
necessary
to
keep
you
under
guard
here
in
the
fortress
until
this
campaign
is
over
look
again
at
the
bundle
and
tell
me
once
more
what
you
see
you
ca
hold
me
here
i
have
a
safe
conduct
pass
from
the
moghul
himself
do
you
good
in
that
case
there
should
be
any
difficulty
only
need
to
examine
it
to
make
sure
it
not
a
forgery
there
should
be
an
opportunity
sometime
after
i
return
from
this
campaign
hawksworth
examined
jadar
and
realized
the
threat
was
not
empty
there
no
reason
for
me
to
stay
you
have
your
lead
jadar
smiled
an
empty
grin
but
with
a
trace
of
bizarre
warmth
at
last
we
beginning
to
understand
each
other
neither
of
us
has
a
rajput
honor
he
tossed
hawksworth
the
portuguese
stiletto
an
interesting
knife
did
you
know
it
took
me
almost
two
weeks
to
find
out
for
sure
who
really
hired
the
assassin
and
for
all
that
trouble
it
was
exactly
who
you
expect
hawksworth
examined
him
in
amazement
and
decided
to
gamble
another
guess
i
suppose
i
have
thanked
you
yet
for
saving
us
from
the
ambush
on
the
river
the
day
we
made
landfall
jadar
waved
his
hand
in
dismissal
mere
curiosity
nothing
more
if
i
had
allowed
them
to
kill
you
we
could
never
have
had
this
interesting
talk
but
you
still
have
many
troubles
ahead
we
both
do
but
i
know
who
my
enemies
are
captain
that
the
difference
the
door
had
begun
to
swing
slowly
inward
yes
these
are
interesting
times
captain
you
may
find
it
difficult
to
stay
alive
but
somehow
i
think
you
manage
for
a
while
longer
hawksworth
watched
nervously
as
the
rajput
guards
filed
into
the
room
and
stationed
themselves
by
the
door
i
plan
to
march
south
in
ten
days
you
would
be
wise
to
leave
tomorrow
for
the
north
while
the
roads
are
still
secure
vasant
rao
has
asked
to
accompany
you
and
i
afraid
i
have
no
choice
but
to
humor
him
i
need
him
here
but
he
is
a
man
of
temperament
i
will
provide
guards
for
you
as
far
north
as
the
narbada
river
after
that
he
will
hire
his
own
horsemen
i
give
him
a
letter
for
a
raja
in
mandu
who
can
supply
whatever
he
needs
jadar
studied
hawksworth
one
last
time
his
eyes
calculating
we
both
have
difficult
times
ahead
but
i
think
we
meet
again
time
may
change
a
few
things
for
both
of
us
as
hawksworth
passed
through
the
open
doorway
he
looked
back
to
see
the
prince
leaning
easily
aginst
a
stack
of
bundles
flipping
a
large
silver
coin
and
suddenly
he
wanted
to
leave
the
fortress
of
burhanpur
more
than
he
had
ever
wanted
anything
in
his
life
the
next
morning
vasant
rao
and
forty
horsemen
were
waiting
with
hawksworth
cart
by
midday
they
had
left
burhanpur
far
behind
and
were
well
on
the
way
north
the
journey
north
through
mandu
ujjain
and
gwalior
to
agra
normally
took
six
weeks
but
when
roads
were
dry
it
was
an
easy
trip
two
days
later
five
prominent
in
the
northern
deccan
died
painfully
in
separate
ambushes
by
bandits
their

confiscated
immediately
by

nadir
sharif
leaned
uneasily
against
the
rooftop
railing
of
his
sprawling
riverside
palace
above
the
and
absently
watched
his
kabuli
pigeons
wing
past
the
curve
of
the
jamuna
river
headed
toward
the
red
fort
they
swept
over
the
heavy
battlements
at
the
river
gate
and
then
veered
precisely
upward
along
the
sheer
eastern
wall
of
the
fort
until
they
reached
the
gold
minaret
atop
the
jasmine
tower
the
private
quarters
of
queen
janahara
they
circled
her
tower
once
then
coalesced
into
a
plumed
spear
driving
directly
upward
toward
the
cloud
bank
that
hovered
over
agra
from
the
east
imported
kabuli
pigeons
with
their
flawless
white
eyes
and
wings
were
nadir
sharifs
secret
joy
unlike
the
inferior
local
breeds
of
the
other
devoted
along
the
west
bank
of
the
jamuna
agra
showplace
his
kabulis
did
not
flit
aimlessly
from
rooftop
to
rooftop
on
their
daily
morning
flight
after
he
opened
the
shutters
on
their
rooftop
grillwork
cage
they
would
trace
a
single
circle
of
his
palace
next
wing
past
the
red
fort
in
a
salute
to
the
queen
then
simply
disappear
into
the
infinite
for
fully
half
a
day
returning
as
regally
as
they
had
first
taken
wing
nadir
sharif
was
the
prime
minister
of
the
moghul
empire
the
brother
of
queen
janahara
and
the
father
of
prince
jadar
favorite
wife
mumtaz
even
in
the
first
light
of
dawn
there
was
no
mistaking
he
was
persian
and
proud
the
early
sun
glanced
off
his
finely
woven
gauze
cape
and
quickened
a
warm
glow
in
the
gold
thread
laced
through
his
yellow
cloak
and
his
pastel
morning
turban
his
quick
eyes
plump
face
and
graying
moustache
testified
to
his
almost
sixty
years
of
life
thirty
spent
at
the
moghul
court
as
close
adviser
to
arangbar
and
before
that
to
arangbar
father
the
great
akman
in
power
and
authority
he
was
exceeded
only
by
the
moghul
himself
nadir
sharifs
palace
was
deliberately
situated
next
to
the
red
fort
just
around
the
broad
curve
of
the
jamuna
the
red
fort
home
of
the
moghul
was
a
vast
rambling
fortress
whose
river
side
towered
over
a
hundred
feet
above
the
western
curve
of
the
jamuna
from
nadir
sharifs
rooftop
the
view
of
the
river
side
of
the
fort
and
arangbar
window
was
unobstructed
darshan
was
the
dawn
appearance
arangbar
made
daily
at
a
special
balcony
in
the
east
wall
of
the
red
fort
next
to
the
river
gate
it
was
strict
custom
that
the
chief
officials
of
arangbar
court
also
appear
daily
on
a
high
platform
just
beneath
the
balcony
where
along
with
the
moghul
they
greeted
the
who
streamed
in
through
the
river
gate
and
provided
visual
confirmation
that
rule
was
intact
the
square
below
the
balcony
a
grassy
expanse
between
the
side
of
the
fort
and
the
river
wall
where
arangbar
held
noontime
elephant
fights
and
on
tuesdays
executions
by
specially
trained
elephants
had
already
filled
almost
to
capacity
agra
most
prominent
noblemen
were
there
as
prudence
required
and
today
there
also
were
clusters
of
important
visitors
several
rajput
chieftains
from
the
northwest
astride
prancing
arabian
horses
passed
regally
through
the
river
gate
and
assumed
prominent
positions
then
a
path
was
cleared
for
a
large
embassy
of
safavid
persian
diplomats
each
of
whose
palanquins
was
borne
by
four
slaves
in
gleaming
velvet
liveries
next
several
desert
uzbek
khans
in
leather
headdress
rode
into
the
square
and
finally
three
portuguese
jesuits
in
black
cassocks
trooped
through
the
river
gate
and
moved
imperiously
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
nadir
sharif
watched
as
his
pigeons
were
swallowed
by
the
morning
haze
and
then
settled
himself
onto
a
canopied
couch
to
observe
the
eunuchs
of
the
had
whispered
that
this
morning
would
be
different
that
there
would
be
a
occurrence
for
once
a
rumor
seemed
all
too
plausible
and
late
the
previous
evening
he
had
sent
a
dispatch
through
a
a
high
judge
pleading
illness
and
excusing
himself
from
and
now
he
had
stationed
himself
to
watch
how
would
the
court
officials
react
had
they
too
heard
the
rumors
and
what
of
those
who
had
gathered
below
to
salute
arangbar
with
the
traditional
most
importantly
what
of
nadir
sharif
this
day
could
well
be
a
turning
point
in
the
course
of
india
history
and
in
the
three
decades
of
his
preeminence
at
court
if
the
rumors
were
true
nadir
sharif
was
easily
the
most
accomplished
courtier
in
india
a
skill
that
had
earned
him
the
most
splendid
palace
in
agra
after
the
moghul
himself
his
position
brought
with
it
not
merely
a
palace
but
also
the
rank
and
wealth
required
to
maintain
it
only
enormous
wealth
could
sustain
the
hungry
host
of
slaves
eunuchs
concubines
musicians
dancers
and
wives
who
thronged
his
agra
palace
success
for
nadir
sharif
had
always
seemed
so
effortless
so
inevitable
he
often
marveled
that
so
few
others
had
ever
grasped
the
elementary
secret
his
simple
formula
for
longevity
in
a
court
where
favorites
daily
rose
and
fell
was
first
to
establish
with
certainty
which
side
of
a
difference
would
inevitably
triumph
and
then
to
unveil
his
own
supporting
views
he
had
made
a
lifelong
habit
of
seeing
everything
and
saying
almost
nothing
he
understood
well
that
thoughts
unsaid
often
served
better
than
those
voiced
too
hastly
whereas
the
way
of
others
might
be
flawed
by
a
penchant
for
the
or
jewels
or
those
intoxicants
the
prophet
ha
so
futilely
prohibited
nadir
sharifs
sole
worldly
obsession
was
power
from
which
nothing
absolutely
nothing
had
ever
turned
his
head
for
a
decade
he
had
ruled
the
moghul
empire
in
all
but
name
forwarding
to
arangbar
only
those
petitions
he
favored
holding
in
advisement
any
he
opposed
counseling
the
moghul
at
every
turn
but
always
through
other
unsuspecting
voices
if
the
advice
was
anything
save
disguised
flattery
his
meticulous
attention
to
affairs
at
court
did
not
exclude
foreign
trade
for
years
his
voice
had
been
raised
against
any
who
counseled
arangbar
in
directions
adverse
to
portuguese
interests
this
attention
did
not
pass
unnoticed
in
goa
and
when
a
kingly
jewel
was
sent
to
arangbar
another
of
only
slightly
inferior
dimensions
always
found
its
way
into
the
hands
of
nadir
sharif
the
first
rays
of
sun
struck
the
hard
ocher
sandstone
of
the
red
east
wall
and
suddenly
it
glowed
like
an
inflamed
ruby
throwing
its
warmth
across
the
face
of
the
jamuna
river
moments
later
the
heightening
sun
illuminated
the
rooftops
of
agra
a
sea
of
red
tile
and
thatch
that
spread
out
in
a
wide
arc
west
of
the
fort
agra
the
capital
of
moghul
india
was
one
of
the
great
cities
of
the
east
it
was
home
to
over
half
a
million
more
than
lived
in
any
capital
of
europe
and
some
said
a
man
on
horseback
could
scarcely
circle
it
in
a
day
yet
most
of
the
city
was
far
from
grand
it
was
a
jumble
of
brick
and
tile
merchant
houses
homes
of
hindu
tradesmen
and
a
spreading
sea
of
mud
and
thatch
hovels
that
sheltered
the
rest
but
along
the
river
on
either
side
of
the
red
fort
had
been
created
a
different
world
there
glistened
the
mansions
of
moghul
grandees
like
nadir
sharif
magical
and
remote
behind
whose
walls
lay
spacious
gardens
cooled
by
marble
fountains
and
gilded
rooms
filled
with
carpets
from
persia
porcelains
from
china
imported
crystal
from
venice
their
thronging
with
exquisite
women
and
their
tapestried
halls
with
hosts
of
slaves
and
eunuchs
nadir
sharif
inhaled
the
clean
air
of
morning
and
surveyed
the
palaces
on
either
side
along
the
riverbank
they
were
all
sumptuous
but
none
more
than
his
own
a
vainer
man
might
have
swelled
with
pride
at
such
a
moment
but
nadir
sharif
knew
from
years
of
court
experience
that
vanity
always
led
inevitably
to
excess
and
finally
to
debt
and
ruin
to
keep
one
place
he
often
told
himself
one
must
know
it
he
also
knew
that
to
hold
one
ground
one
must
know
when
to
shift
his
reverie
was
abruptly
dispelled
by
the
noise
of
shuffling
feet
and
then
a
hesitant
voice
a
man
is
at
the
outer
gate
sharif
sahib
asking
to
see
you
nadir
sharif
turned
to
see
the
eunuch
spotless
white
turban
bowing
toward
him
he
flared
inwardly
that
his
orders
for
absolute
privacy
had
been
ignored
and
then
as
always
he
waited
a
few
seconds
for
composure
before
speaking
i
too
ill
to
receive
have
you
already
forgotten
my
orders
forgive
me
sharif
sahib
the
eunuch
bowed
ever
lower
and
raised
his
clasped
palms
in
involuntary
supplication
he
has
demanded
an
audience
he
claimed
he
has
arrived
last
night
from
the
deccan
he
was
with
the
prince
nadir
sharifs
body
tensed
perceptibly
what
name
did
he
give
a
rajput
name
sharif
sahib
he
said
he
was
requested
by
her
highness
the
princess
to
report
to
you
immediately
on
arriving
nadir
sharifs
heart
skipped
a
beat
does
this
mean
the
english
has
arrived
allah
on
this
of
all
days
tell
him
i
am
at
home
the
voice
was
coolly
the
eunuch
bowed
again
and
disappeared
without
a
word
as
nadir
sharif
watched
his
skirt
vanish
past
the
doorway
tapestry
he
tried
to
clear
his
mind
and
decide
quickly
what
now
must
be
done
instinctively
he
turned
once
more
to
monitor
the
balcony
still
nothing
then
he
smiled
fleetingly
realizing
that
the
fate
of
the
englishman
would
depend
very
much
on
what
happened
at
this
very
morning
the
visitor
appeared
in
freshly
brushed
red
turban
and
jeweled
earrings
and
wordlessly
strode
past
the
eunuch
at
the
doorway
pushing
the
partially
opened
tapestry
aside
as
though
a
foe
in
battle
there
was
about
the
man
the
haughty
carriage
and
contemptuous
eyes
always
encountered
among
rajputs
in
high
places
and
nadir
sharif
recognized
him
immediately
the
prime
minister
also
knew
this
particular
rajput
had
never
trusted
him
and
never
would
nimaste
sharif
sahib
vasant
rao
salaam
was
correct
but
cold
it
always
a
pleasure
to
see
you
when
did
you
arrive
last
evening
have
you
arranged
lodgings
for
the
english
even
before
informing
me
you
were
here
he
has
no
lodgings
yet
sharif
sahib
only
rooms
at
a
guest
house
the
insisted
no
one
be
informed
of
his
arrival
he
did
not
say
why
vasant
rao
returned
nadir
sharifs
expressionless
stare
the
prince
orders
were
to
honor
the
requests
whenever
possible
nadir
sharifs
face
betrayed
none
of
his
anger
as
he
turned
again
toward
the
balcony
a
flock
of
vagrant
pigeons
darted
overhead
following
the
line
of
palaces
along
the
river
how
is
the
child
he
is
well
formed
sharif
sahib
your
daughter
her
highness
was
also
well
when
i
left
burhanpur
she
gave
me
this
dispatch
for
you
nadir
sharif
accepted
the
bamboo
tube
and
controlling
his
expression
tossed
it
aside
as
though
it
were
of
no
more
consequence
than
a
gardener
report
brought
by
a
eunuch
i
received
no
pigeons
from
her
for
four
weeks
only
official
dispatches
from
ghulam
secretary
in
burhanpur
which
tell
nothing
why
is
he
in
the
field
with
jadar
what
is
happening
i
not
with
the
army
now
sharif
sahib
vasant
rao
casually
stroked
his
moustache
perhaps
the
prince
has
ordered
secrecy
to
protect
his
movements
toward
the
south
nadir
sharif
started
to
reply
but
immediately
thought
better
of
it
instead
he
traced
his
finger
along
the
railing
of
the
balcony
in
silence
and
seemed
to
listen
to
the
distant
pigeons
as
he
rotated
the
answer
in
his
mind
knowing
it
was
a
lie
and
quickly
evaluating
the
possible
reasons
why
in
the
north
dispatching
pigeons
in
the
field
might
be
a
risk
but
never
in
the
south
where
the
infidel
deccanis
always
know
the
deployment
of
our
army
better
than
its
own
commanders
no
something
planned
that
jadar
does
not
want
me
to
know
which
can
only
mean
his
impulsive
highness
prince
jadar
has
undertaken
something
foolish
i
know
him
too
well
after
a
moment
nadir
sharif
broke
the
silence
without
turning
his
face
from
the
balcony
tell
me
about
the
do
you
mean
what
he
says
or
what
i
think
about
him
both
he
claims
to
be
an
ambassador
for
the
english
king
but
his
only
credentials
are
a
letter
he
brings
said
to
request
a
trading
from
his
majesty
what
are
the
intentions
of
this
king
trade
or
eventual
meddling
no
one
has
seen
the
letter
sharif
sahib
but
the
englishman
says
his
king
merely
asks
to
trade
yearly
at
surat
which
means
the
english
must
again
contest
with
the
portuguese
until
one
of
them
eventually
abandons
our
ports
they
can
not
both
trade
the
portuguese
viceroy
would
never
allow
it
what
you
say
seems
true
it
said
the
christians
in
europe
are
having
a
holy
war
i
do
understand
the
cause
but
the
english
and
the
portuguese
seem
to
be
historic
enemies
because
of
it
however
the
englishman
claims
their
disputes
in
europe
are
now
over
and
that
the
portuguese
attack
on
his
ships
was
in
violation
of
a
treaty
of
peace
recently
signed
whether
this
is
actually
true
no
one
knows
the
english
ships
are
gone
now
but
if
they
come
again
who
can
say
what
will
happen
will
they
come
again
nadir
sharifs
eyes
told
nothing
of
his
thoughts
but
his
voice
sharpened
soon
the
englishman
has
not
said
perhaps
next
year
perhaps
before
that
vasant
rao
caught
the
inflection
in
nadir
sharif
voice
and
it
triggered
a
chain
of
improbable
possibilities
goa
will
never
allow
them
open
access
to
surat
there
must
be
war
on
our
seas
if
the
english
return
nadir
sharif
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
who
do
you
think
will
triumph
ask
those
who
claim
the
gift
of
prophecy
sharif
sahib
i
only
a
soldier
that
why
i
asked
you
i
can
only
say
that
if
other
english
are
like
this
man
then
they
are
a
determined
race
he
seems
to
seek
the
new
because
it
is
there
yet
perhaps
not
knowing
what
he
will
do
with
it
once
it
is
his
what
do
you
mean
the
englishman
hawksworth
he
claims
to
be
here
for
his
king
and
his
king
only
but
i
sense
this
is
only
partly
true
he
is
a
man
of
complex
desires
then
why
is
he
here
i
think
he
is
here
also
for
himself
he
wants
something
perhaps
it
to
make
war
on
the
portuguese
he
will
not
shrink
from
it
but
i
think
his
own
coming
to
india
is
to
find
something
he
is
searching
for
what
i
can
not
say
he
is
a
man
of
curious
parts
he
spoke
once
of
spending
time
in
prison
and
he
is
devoted
to
playing
a
small
stringed
instrument
he
understands
the
tongue
of
the
moghuls
and
he
questions
all
he
sees
he
is
beginning
to
know
india
because
he
has
made
it
his
purpose
to
know
india
if
he
stays
he
could
become
very
troubling
for
the
portuguese
and
will
that
bring
no
good
to
affairs
here
nadir
sharif
paused
will
it
i
do
not
follow
matters
of
state
sharif
sahib
nadir
sharif
let
the
silence
swell
then
in
a
voice
brittle
as
ice
he
spoke
why
did
the
prince
meet
with
him
vasant
rao
tried
without
success
to
mask
his
surprise
lord
krishna
they
know
everything
in
agra
there
was
a
meeting
vasant
rao
hesitated
then
decided
to
maintain
discretion
but
neither
spoke
of
it
afterwards
nadir
sharif
studied
him
pondering
if
it
were
true
then
he
turned
to
glance
at
the
balcony
as
he
spoke
the
moghul
has
demanded
that
the
english
be
brought
to
immediately
after
he
arrives
does
that
mean
today
vasant
rao
shifted
with
surprise
his
majesty
will
hear
soon
enough
he
has
arrived
there
is
no
choice
then
the
must
be
told
to
prepare
sharif
sahib
he
has
a
chest
containing
gifts
and
the
letter
i
know
what
he
has
tell
him
he
must
bring
the
gifts
to
for
his
sake
i
hope
they
not
trifles
his
majesty
is
most
anxious
to
see
them
and
the
queen
is
even
more
anxious
to
see
the
letter
nadir
sharif
told
himself
then
he
smiled
as
he
realized
he
would
see
it
first
it
will
be
an
interesting
afternoon
a
fanfare
of
drums
sounded
faintly
from
the
ramparts
of
the
red
fort
and
for
a
moment
the
morning
sun
seemed
to
glow
even
brighter
against
the
gleaming
panels
of
the
jasmine
tower
nadir
sharif
turned
toward
the
balcony
from
the
shadow
of
its
embroidered
satin
awning
a
figure
had
suddenly
emerged
it
was
just
possible
to
make
out
the
man
glistening
robe
and
his
elaborate
patterned
turban
then
the
heavy
jewels
of
his
earrings
momentarily
caught
the
morning
sunshine
and
sent
streams
of
light
flashing
outward
all
the
waiting
crowd
bowed
low
each
man
touching
the
back
of
his
right
hand
to
the
ground
and
then
bringing
the
palm
to
his
forehead
as
he
drew
erect
it
was
the
formal
given
the
moghul
signifying
each
man
readiness
to
give
himself
as
an
offering
nadir
sharif
scrutinized
the
scene
carefully
and
drew
an
almost
audible
sigh
of
relief
then
he
turned
to
vasant
rao
have
you
ever
seen
the
moghul
at
morning
he
continued
on
distractedly
neglecting
to
pause
for
an
answer
you
know
actually
a
custom
began
by
akman
who
worshiped
the
sun
as
one
of
the
gods
but
arangbar
appears
in
order
to
maintain
his
own
authority
if
he
missed
for
a
day
rumors
would
begin
he
was
dead
three
days
and
there
would
be
anarchy
suddenly
the
cheers
from
the
courtyard
died
abruptly
in
the
silence
that
followed
a
single
pigeon
cry
could
be
heard
from
overhead
nadir
sharif
whirled
to
see
a
second
figure
now
standing
on
the
balcony
beside
arangbar
it
was
a
woman
he
could
not
tell
if
she
wore
a
veil
but
her
tiara
of
jewels
glistened
in
the
early
sun
the
color
drained
from
nadir
sharif
face
as
he
watched
so
the
rumor
was
true
for
the
first
time
in
history
she
has
appeared
beside
him
at
to
be
worshiped
equally
vasant
rao
found
himself
staring
in
astonishment
queen
janahara
this
is
truly
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
the
prince
he
will
never
see
agra
again
unless
he
at
the
head
of
an
army
or
in
chains
what
does
it
mean
vasant
rao
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
times
and
fashions
change
perhaps
it
a
whim
of
his
majesty
nadir
sharif
did
not
turn
his
gaze
from
the
balcony
he
did
not
want
vasant
rao
to
see
his
eyes
escort
the
to
today
he
not
safe
here
alone
as
you
wish
sharif
sahib
vasant
rao
paused
and
studied
the
back
of
nadir
sharifs
turban
do
you
have
a
message
for
the
prince
when
i
return
official
channels
will
serve
for
any
message
i
have
to
give
the
prince
the
prime
minister
whirled
with
uncharacteristic
abruptness
that
will
be
all
you
would
be
wise
to
be
out
of
agra
when
the
sun
rises
tomorrow
as
vasant
rao
made
his
way
past
the
waiting
eunuchs
nadir
sharif
turned
once
more
to
examine
the
balcony
he
watched
in
growing
dismay
as
the
courtiers
on
the
platform
began
salaams
to
queen
janahara
who
now
stood
boldly
at
the
forefront
of
the
canopied
marble
portico
then
he
recalled
the
dispatch
from
mumtaz
a
line
of
mounted
imperial
guards
cleared
a
pathway
through
the
narrow
street
now
a
midday
throng
of
bullock
carts
porters
ambling
cattle
and
women
balancing
heavy
brass
pots
atop
their
heads
along
both
sides
of
the
street
tan
awnings
shielded
lines
of
eyed
bearded
merchants
who
squatted
on
their
porches
beckoning
all
to
inspect
their
unprecedented
bargains
in
cloth
reeds
betel
leaves
vendors
sizzled
flat
bread
in
round
pans
and
dropped
balls
of
brown
dough
into
dark
pots
of
smoking
oil
seasoning
the
dusty
air
with
piquant
spice
above
the
clatter
of
their
horses
hooves
came
a
cacophony
of
street
hindi
squeaking
cart
wheels
children
discordant
piping
between
the
open
shops
were
ornate
doorways
framed
in
delicate
plasterwork
scallops
leading
upward
to
overhead
balconies
supported
by
red
sandstone
brackets
behind
the
latticework
screens
that
fronted
these
balconies
some
carved
rosewood
some
filigreed
marble
hawksworth
could
see
clusters
of
idle
women
chewing
betel
and
fanning
themselves
as
they
leaned
forward
to
inspect
the
procession
below
hawksworth
studied
the
helmeted
guards
around
him
whose
ornate
shields
bore
the
moghurs
personal
seal
and
reflected
on
his
introduction
to
agra
his
caravan
from
the
south
had
arrived
at
the
city
outskirts
the
evening
before
after
the
sun
light
had
died
away
and
as
he
requested
vasant
rao
had
found
a
traditional
guest
house
for
them
it
was
near
the
center
of
town
inconspicuous
and
its
primary
amenities
were
a
rainproof
thatch
roof
and
a
stone
floor
tomorrow
the
rajput
had
told
him
he
must
find
a
house
befitting
an
ambassador
the
guards
accompanying
them
into
agra
had
not
even
dismounted
had
turned
back
immediately
for
the
south
and
only
vasant
rao
stayed
to
share
the
evening
meal
they
had
dined
quickly
on
fried
bread
and
lentils
and
afterward
the
rajput
had
retrieved
his
saddle
from
the
stable
and
pillowing
it
under
his
helmet
immediately
fallen
asleep
curved
sword
in
hand
hawksworth
had
lain
awake
listening
to
the
night
sounds
of
agra
wondering
what
his
next
move
should
be
sleep
finally
overtook
him
just
before
dawn
broke
he
awoke
to
discover
vasant
rao
already
gone
but
the
rajput
had
mysteriously
returned
in
time
to
share
a
breakfast
of
more
fried
bread
and
spiced
curds
after
eating
vasant
rao
had
announced
that
arangbar
expected
him
in
that
afternoon
the
rest
of
the
morning
had
been
spent
hastily
procuring
bearers
for
his
chest
of
gifts
and
cleaning
the
mildewed
doublet
and
hose
he
had
been
instructed
by
the
company
to
wear
just
after
noon
a
contingent
of
the
moghul
personal
guard
had
arrived
unexpectedly
with
orders
to
escort
them
through
the
center
of
agra
directly
to
the
moghul
private
entrance
to
the
red
fort
their
horses
emerged
abruptly
from
the
narrow
jostling
street
and
hawksworth
realized
they
had
entered
a
wide
sunlit
plaza
opening
outward
from
the
fort
south
gate
the
close
acrid
smells
of
the
town
were
immediately
scourged
by
the
searing
midday
heat
hawksworth
reined
in
his
horse
and
stared
at
the
fort
incredulous
at
its
immensity
they
were
facing
two
concentric
walls
of
polished
red
sandstone
the
outer
easily
forty
feet
high
and
the
inner
at
least
seventy
both
were
obviously
thick
with
battlements
for
musketry
and
crowned
by
a
wide
wooden
drawbridge
leading
to
the
entrance
spanned
a
moat
that
followed
the
outer
wall
in
both
directions
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
it
had
to
be
the
largest
most
powerfully
built
fortress
hawksworth
had
ever
seen
no
story
he
had
heard
no
imagined
grandeur
had
prepared
him
for
this
first
view
the
sight
was
at
once
awesome
and
chilling
no
wonder
the
moghul
frightens
all
of
india
it
impregnable
the
outer
blocks
of
the
walls
seem
to
be
linked
by
massive
iron
rings
and
the
round
towers
spaced
along
them
have
slots
designed
for
heavy
ordnance
with
two
thick
walls
which
probably
also
have
a
moat
between
it
would
be
impossible
to
storm
and
cannon
would
be
almost
useless
vasant
rao
monitored
hawksworth
reaction
and
his
dark
eyes
betrayed
his
pride
do
you
understand
now
why
the
moghul
is
held
in
such
regard
no
king
in
the
world
could
have
a
palace
as
grand
as
this
did
you
know
that
the
distance
around
the
walls
is
over
one
what
would
that
be
around
two
of
your
english
miles
hawksworth
nodded
assent
as
their
guards
led
them
directly
across
the
wide
drawbridge
and
through
a
passageway
the
outer
edge
of
the
drawbridge
was
connected
by
heavy
chains
to
rollers
at
the
top
of
the
entryway
the
two
rollers
worked
in
a
stone
channel
cut
upward
into
the
steep
walls
of
the
passage
and
were
held
in
place
by
iron
bars
inserted
into
the
channel
the
bridge
would
lift
automatically
by
simple
removal
of
the
iron
bars
around
them
now
was
a
small
heavily
defended
barbican
and
ahead
between
the
outer
and
inner
wall
was
a
gateway
set
in
a
towering
portal
almost
eighty
feet
high
that
was
faced
with
gleaming
blue
enamel
tiles
how
many
gates
like
this
are
there
the
red
fort
actually
has
four
gates
one
on
the
river
and
one
on
each
of
the
other
sides
this
is
the
southern
gate
which
the
moghul
recently
renamed
the
amar
singh
gate
vasant
rao
lowered
his
voice
after
a
defiant
rajput
who
he
murdered
i
have
never
seen
it
before
but
it
is
even
more
beautiful
than
the
public
delhi
gate
on
the
north
which
is
inlaid
marble
the
red
fort
is
truly
astonishing
tell
me
captain
is
there
anything
in
your
england
to
compare
nothing
hawksworth
seached
for
his
voice
why
is
it
so
large
this
is
the
place
where
india
is
governed
and
the
moghul
does
not
live
alone
he
has
to
house
over
a
thousand
women
an
army
to
protect
him
and
his
treasury
and
more
servants
than
man
can
count
the
rajput
seemed
momentarily
puzzled
by
the
question
then
he
continued
with
a
sly
smile
the
fort
was
built
by
the
moghul
father
the
great
akman
people
say
it
required
over
eight
years
to
complete
he
also
built
another
complete
city
in
the
desert
a
few
west
of
here
but
later
he
abandoned
it
and
moved
back
to
agra
surely
your
english
king
governs
from
a
palace
his
majesty
king
james
has
a
palace
at
hampton
court
hawksworth
paused
but
england
is
governed
by
laws
made
in
parliament
which
has
its
own
place
to
meet
it
sounds
like
you
have
a
very
weak
king
captain
hawksworth
if
he
can
not
rule
vasant
rao
glanced
nervously
at
the
guards
you
would
do
well
not
to
tell
that
to
arangbar
in
india
there
is
only
one
law
the
word
of
the
moghul
as
they
entered
the
portico
of
the
amar
singh
gate
hawksworth
glanced
behind
him
relieved
to
see
that
their
porters
still
followed
one
at
each
side
of
his
sea
chest
vasant
rao
had
cautioned
him
not
to
deliver
all
the
gifts
at
once
since
arangbar
would
expect
a
new
gift
each
time
they
met
king
james
letter
he
carried
personally
carefully
secreted
inside
his
doublet
inside
the
archway
of
the
gate
were
sets
of
thick
wooden
doors
opened
back
against
the
sides
these
inner
doors
bristled
with
long
iron
spikes
and
as
hawksworth
puzzled
over
them
vasant
rao
caught
his
questioning
look
those
spikes
embedded
in
the
doors
are
to
prevent
war
elephants
from
battering
them
in
with
their
foreheads
it
common
in
a
fortress
he
smiled
but
then
i
keep
forgetting
your
england
probably
has
no
elephants
ahead
at
the
terminus
of
the
archway
the
path
was
blocked
by
a
heavy
chain
and
armed
sentries
the
guards
reined
in
their
horses
and
began
to
dismount
while
their
leader
passed
brusque
orders
to
vasant
rao
we
ride
no
farther
vasant
rao
translated
as
he
swung
from
the
saddle
he
says
no
one
except
the
moghul
himself
his
sons
or
his
women
is
allowed
to
ride
through
the
amar
singh
gate
it
strictly
enforced
hawksworth
paused
one
last
time
feeling
about
him
the
weight
of
the
thick
walls
and
the
ornate
tower
rising
above
them
a
great
blue
jewel
in
the
afternoon
sun
for
a
moment
he
had
the
curious
sensation
of
entering
a
giant
tomb
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
slowly
dismounted
feeling
suddenly
conspicuous
in
his
formal
silk
hose
and
ruffled
doubtlet
vasant
rao
passed
the
reins
of
his
horse
to
a
waiting
servant
and
drew
alongside
his
eyes
intent
does
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
the
moghul
would
name
one
of
the
four
gates
to
the
red
fort
after
a
rajput
he
stroked
the
curl
of
his
moustache
and
lowered
his
voice
it
a
story
you
should
hear
it
not
meant
as
an
honor
what
do
you
mean
it
intended
to
be
a
warning
to
all
rajputs
of
what
happens
when
he
is
defied
there
was
several
years
ago
a
rajput
adventurer
named
amar
singh
he
sought
to
rise
to
position
in
arangbar
court
he
eventually
did
rise
to
the
rank
of
a
thousand
horse
and
along
the
way
he
asked
and
received
the
help
of
an
old
courtier
who
had
influence
only
later
did
the
rajput
find
out
that
this
man
expected
his
younger
daughter
in
payment
vasant
rao
smile
wryly
they
say
she
was
incredibly
beautiful
well
amar
singh
was
a
true
rajput
and
he
was
outraged
naturally
he
refused
so
the
courtier
who
had
helped
him
decided
to
have
revenge
and
he
went
to
arangbar
and
told
him
about
a
certain
beautiful
rajput
girl
who
would
make
an
excellent
addition
to
the
the
moghul
immediately
sent
some
of
his
personal
guards
to
amar
singh
house
to
take
the
girl
when
amar
singh
realized
why
the
guards
had
come
he
called
for
the
girl
and
stabbed
her
to
death
before
their
eyes
then
he
took
horse
and
rode
to
the
red
fort
even
riding
through
this
gate
he
rode
into
the
audience
hall
and
demanded
that
arangbar
appear
and
explain
such
things
captain
are
simply
not
done
in
agra
the
moment
he
dismounted
he
was
cut
to
pieces
by
a
dozen
of
arangbar
guards
then
the
moghul
decided
to
name
this
gate
after
him
to
remind
all
rajputs
of
his
fate
but
he
need
not
have
bothered
no
rajput
will
ever
forget
leaving
the
servants
with
their
horses
they
proceeded
on
foot
up
a
wide
inclined
path
that
led
through
an
enclosed
square
around
the
sides
of
the
square
were
porticoes
and
galleries
where
horsemen
with
swords
and
pikes
waited
those
men
are
on
their
their
watch
vasant
rao
pointed
to
the
porticoes
every
soldier
in
agra
must
stand
watch
once
every
seven
days
either
here
or
in
the
large
square
inside
where
we
going
it
the
moghul
law
they
passed
through
another
large
gate
and
suddenly
a
half
dozen
turbaned
guards
in
leather
armor
and
wearing
long
curved
swords
drew
alongside
as
though
expecting
them
now
with
a
double
escort
they
began
the
ascent
of
a
long
walkway
perhaps
twenty
paces
wide
situated
between
two
high
brick
walls
hawksworth
leather
shoes
padded
against
the
square
paving
stones
which
had
been
striated
to
permit
easy
footing
for
the
moghurs
horses
and
elephants
as
they
reached
the
end
they
emerged
into
another
large
court
comprising
the
southeast
corner
of
the
fort
ahead
was
yet
a
fourth
gate
as
they
passed
through
hawksworth
realized
it
was
protected
by
more
mounted
horsemen
in
the
recessed
lower
porticoes
and
archers
in
elevated
galleries
they
walked
past
the
wide
wooden
doors
and
into
a
vast
milling
square
it
was
several
hundred
feet
on
the
side
and
ringed
with
arcades
where
still
more
mounted
horsemen
waited
a
wide
roadway
divided
the
square
this
is
the
quadrangle
i
only
saw
it
once
before
but
then
i
entered
from
the
public
side
vasant
rao
indicated
an
identical
gate
directly
opposite
over
there
the
guards
directed
them
toward
a
large
multicolored
silk
canopy
fanning
out
from
the
tall
buildings
on
their
right
the
area
beneath
the
canopy
was
cordoned
off
from
the
square
by
a
red
velvet
railing
and
porters
with
cudgels
stood
around
the
perimeter
vasant
rao
seemed
increasingly
nervous
as
their
escorts
led
them
forward
past
the
guards
at
the
entry
to
the
canopy
hawksworth
noticed
that
the
air
beneath
the
canopy
was
heavy
with
incense
ambergris
and
aloe
burning
in
gold
and
silver
censers
hanging
from
poles
the
arcade
ahead
is
the
the
hall
of
public
audience
where
the
moghul
holds
his
daily
vasant
rao
pointed
toward
the
steps
that
led
upward
to
a
large
open
pavilion
at
the
far
end
of
the
canopy
it
was
several
stories
high
and
over
a
hundred
feet
on
each
side
the
roof
was
borne
by
marble
arches
supported
by
rows
of
white
columns
no
man
with
rank
under
five
hundred
horse
is
allowed
to
enter
inside
the
railing
i
think
that
why
we
have
a
special
escort
above
the
crowd
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
was
a
raised
platform
of
white
marble
standing
about
three
feet
from
the
floor
and
covered
by
its
own
tapestried
canopy
the
platform
was
surrounded
by
a
silver
railing
and
several
turbaned
men
holding
rolls
of
documents
were
now
struggling
to
gain
a
position
at
the
rail
all
around
them
the
crowd
buzzed
with
anticipation
behind
and
above
the
platform
in
a
marble
gallery
set
in
the
wall
rested
an
immense
throne
carved
from
black
marble
at
its
four
corners
were
statues
of
rearing
lions
each
spangled
with
jewels
which
supported
in
their
silver
paws
a
canopy
of
pure
gold
the
walls
on
either
side
of
the
throne
were
latticework
marble
screens
through
which
the
women
could
watch
i
never
seen
the
throne
this
close
before
it
famous
vasant
rao
paused
and
there
are
some
in
agra
who
would
sell
their
brother
to
have
it
the
imperial
guards
suddenly
saluted
fists
against
their
leather
shields
turned
and
marched
down
the
steps
of
the
and
back
into
the
square
vasant
rao
watched
them
disappear
into
the
crowd
and
then
he
shook
the
left
sleeve
of
his
riding
cloak
and
a
naked
the
deadly
tiger
knife
all
rajputs
carried
dropped
into
his
hand
its
handle
was
a
grip
between
two
prongs
designed
to
be
held
in
the
fist
and
thrust
directly
forward
without
a
word
he
slipped
it
into
a
sheath
secured
in
the
sash
of
his
belt
hawksworth
pretended
not
to
notice
and
instead
turned
to
examine
the
crowd
next
to
them
an
assembly
of
persian
diplomats
wearing
heavy
robes
and
turbans
eyed
hawksworth
plain
doublet
and
hose
with
open
contempt
the
air
was
thick
was
sweat
and
incense
and
the
sparkle
of
gold
and
jewels
uniformed
servants
sounded
a
drum
roll
on
two
large
brass
kettles
at
the
back
of
the
throne
and
the
velvet
curtains
behind
the
throne
parted
two
guards
with
swords
entered
briskly
and
stood
at
attention
one
on
either
side
of
the
parted
curtains
hawksworth
felt
his
pulse
surge
as
the
next
figure
entered
through
the
curtains
he
was
of
middle
height
with
a
small
moustache
and
glistening
diamond
earrings
he
wore
a
tight
patterned
turban
a
blue
robe
secured
by
a
gold
brocade
sash
jeweled
rings
on
both
hands
and
a
massive
string
of
pearls
a
sword
and
dagger
were
at
his
waist
and
two
feline
cubs
frisked
by
his
side
hawksworth
studied
them
in
confusion
and
after
a
moment
realized
they
must
be
baby
lions
an
animal
famous
in
english
folklore
but
never
actually
seen
firsthand
by
anyone
in
england
at
that
instant
a
din
of
kettledrums
erupted
from
galleries
at
the
sides
of
the
square
almost
as
one
those
waiting
called
out
a
salaam
bent
forward
and
touched
the
back
of
their
right
hand
to
the
ground
and
then
to
their
forehead
as
they
drew
erect
the
of
the
moghul
had
begun
you
did
not
perform
the
vasant
rao
turned
to
hawksworth
with
dismay
in
his
voice
he
may
have
taken
note
of
it
that
was
unwise
my
friend
an
ambassador
for
a
king
does
prostrate
himself
you
new
to
india
that
may
be
taken
as
an
excuse
the
other
ambassadors
here
know
better
as
they
watched
three
other
men
slowly
emerged
from
behind
the
throne
and
took
their
places
on
the
marble
platform
standing
beside
the
moghul
they
all
wore
jeweled
turbans
and
each
had
a
sash
of
gold
cloth
about
the
waist
hawksworth
turned
to
vasant
rao
in
time
to
see
a
look
of
hatred
flash
through
his
eyes
who
are
they
the
two
younger
men
are
his
sons
i
saw
them
once
before
in
agra
traditional
that
his
sons
join
him
at
the
when
they
are
here
the
younger
one
is
allaudin
he
will
be
married
next
month
to
queen
janahara
daughter
the
other
one
is
his
drunken
brother
parwaz
the
older
man
is
zainul
beg
the
moghurs
his
chief
counsel
the
father
of
nadir
sharif
the
prime
minister
and
he
also
the
father
of
queen
janahara
hawksworth
watched
as
yet
another
man
emerged
through
the
curtain
walked
casually
past
the
throne
and
was
helped
onto
the
marble
platform
directly
in
front
he
turned
to
the
silver
rail
where
a
dozen
petitions
were
immediately
thrust
up
to
him
vasant
rao
nudged
hawksworth
and
pointed
and
that
nadir
sharif
the
prime
minister
remember
him
well
no
one
reaches
the
moghul
without
his
consent
the
prime
minister
paused
to
study
the
faces
below
and
then
reached
out
for
a
petition
he
unrolled
it
scanned
it
quickly
and
turned
to
arangbar
passing
it
upward
with
a
comment
only
those
by
the
throne
could
hear
the
business
of
the
day
was
underway
arangbar
listened
with
obvious
boredom
as
one
petition
after
another
was
set
before
him
he
held
counsel
with
his
sons
and
with
the
and
frequently
he
would
turn
to
the
marble
screen
off
the
right
side
of
the
throne
and
discuss
a
petition
with
someone
waiting
behind
it
below
the
platform
several
ambassadors
shuffled
trying
to
mask
their
impatience
hawksworth
suddenly
realized
that
the
boxes
they
held
many
of
beaten
gold
contained
presents
for
the
moghul
he
looked
at
his
own
leatherbound
wooden
chest
shabby
by
comparison
and
his
heart
began
to
sink
after
a
short
while
the
moghul
seemed
to
lose
patience
with
the
petitions
and
ignoring
the
waiting
nobles
abruptly
signaled
for
a
review
of
the
day
elephant
troops
moments
later
a
line
of
war
elephants
entered
through
the
public
gate
and
began
to
march
file
across
the
back
of
the
square
their
tusks
were
wreathed
with
gold
bands
and
they
wore
coverings
of
embroidered
cloth
which
were
strung
with
tinkling
bells
and
tassels
of
tibetan
yak
hair
as
each
reached
a
spot
directly
in
front
of
the
it
stopped
kneeled
and
trumpeted
to
arangbar
when
the
last
elephant
had
passed
drums
were
sounded
again
and
a
group
of
eight
men
came
into
the
square
leading
a
snarling
beast
by
heavy
chains
attached
to
its
iron
collar
it
was
tawny
with
a
heavy
mane
and
powerful
paws
and
it
roared
out
its
displeasure
as
it
writhed
and
clawed
at
the
chains
hawksworth
took
one
look
and
realized
it
was
a
male
lion
that
seems
to
be
his
majesty
new
toy
vasant
rao
pointed
nervously
he
collects
lions
as
pets
that
one
must
have
just
been
captured
arangbar
studied
the
lion
with
obvious
delight
then
he
bent
down
and
stroked
one
of
the
cubs
by
his
side
lifting
it
to
better
view
the
new
prize
the
assembly
watched
spellbound
for
a
moment
then
burst
into
cheers
as
hawksworth
watched
arangbar
set
down
the
lion
cub
and
spoke
with
his
zainul
beg
stared
into
the
crowd
and
then
pointed
moments
later
the
black
cassock
of
a
jesuit
appeared
at
the
railing
with
a
start
hawksworth
recognized
father
alvarez
sarmento
last
seen
in
the
courtyard
of
mukarrab
khan
palace
in
surat
the
jesuit
listened
to
the
instructions
and
then
turned
to
the
crowd
his
announcement
was
in
english
his
majesty
orders
the
ambassador
from
england
to
come
forward
vasant
rao
touched
hawksworth
arm
and
reached
out
to
clasp
his
hand
this
is
your
moment
my
friend
by
the
time
is
through
i
will
be
far
from
here
why
are
you
leaving
hawksworth
turned
and
looked
into
his
eyes
suddenly
realizing
that
vasant
rao
was
the
closest
thing
he
had
to
a
friend
in
india
it
impossible
for
me
to
stay
longer
vasant
rao
paused
and
hawksworth
sensed
his
warmth
was
genuine
suddenly
the
rajput
reached
into
the
sash
at
his
belt
and
drew
out
his
sheathed
you
saved
my
life
once
in
the
village
and
i
never
found
the
words
to
thank
you
perhaps
this
can
say
it
for
me
take
it
as
a
token
of
friendship
from
a
rajput
it
was
given
to
me
by
my
father
and
it
has
tasted
blood
more
times
than
i
can
count
you
a
brave
and
honest
man
and
i
think
we
meet
again
before
hawksworth
could
speak
vasant
rao
embraced
him
warmly
and
melted
into
the
crowd
a
pathway
was
clearing
through
the
glaring
nobles
and
hawksworth
quickly
slipped
the
katar
into
his
doublet
as
he
leaned
over
to
secure
the
chest
when
he
reached
the
silver
railing
sarmento
was
waiting
let
me
welcome
you
to
agra
captain
the
jesuit
spoke
quietly
in
english
his
face
a
hard
mask
i
pray
god
gave
you
a
pleasant
journey
i
thought
you
were
bound
for
lahore
in
time
captain
in
time
but
we
have
an
agra
mission
as
well
our
flock
here
grows
it
must
be
tended
and
do
you
remember
what
we
agreed
that
night
in
surat

for
the
inglish
ambassador
arangbar
voice
interrupted
speaking
in
persian
i
would
know
his
name
he
asks
your
name
sarmento
spoke
quietly
to
hawksworth
in
english
you
must
bow
when
you
give
it
i
am
brian
hawksworth
ambassador
of
his
majesty
king
james
the
first
of
england
hawksworth
replied
in
turkish
trying
to
remember
the
speech
he
had
been
told
to
deliver
a
look
of
delighted
surprise
flashed
through
arangbar
eyes
hawksworth
bowed
and
then
continued
his
majesty
king
james
has
asked
me
to
convey
his
friendship
to
his
most
noble
majesty
arangbar
moghul
of
india
together
with
certain
unworthy
tokens
of
his
regard
hawksworth
tried
to
think
quickly
of
a
way
to
explain
the
unimpressive
gifts
king
james
had
sent
those
trifles
he
sends
are
not
intended
as
gifts
deserving
of
your
majesty
for
that
would
be
a
bounty
no
single
man
could
deliver
instead
he
has
asked
me
to
bring
certain
common
products
of
our
country
not
as
gifts
for
they
are
too
unworthy
but
as
samples
of
english
workmanship
that
your
majesty
may
examine
personally
the
goods
he
offers
your
merchants
in
trade
these
are
the
first
of
many
worthy
gifts
he
is
now
assembling
for
your
majesty
to
be
sent
on
future
voyages
to
your
land
you
speak
the
tongue
of
the
moghuls
ambassador
already
your
king
does
me
honor
i
welcome
you
in
his
name
arangbar
leaned
forward
to
watch
as
hawksworth
opened
the
clasp
on
the
chest
the
first
items
were
samples
of
english
woolens
lace
and
brocade
crafted
into
doublets
hawksworth
laid
these
aside
and
took
out
a
brace
of
pistols
a
handled
sword
an
hourglass
in
carved
ivory
and
finally
a
gold
whistle
studded
with
small
diamonds
the
moghul
peered
down
from
his
marble
throne
impassively
and
then
called
for
them
to
be
brought
to
him
while
he
examined
each
gift
briefly
assessing
it
with
a
quick
glance
and
calling
for
the
next
hawksworth
reached
into
the
corner
of
the
box
and
withdrew
the
next
present
a
english
hat
topped
with
a
feather
when
arangbar
saw
the
hat
his
eyes
brightened
at
last
i
can
look
like
a
he
pushed
aside
the
other
gifts
and
called
for
the
hat
he
turned
it
in
his
hand
for
a
moment
then
removed
his
jeweled
turban
and
clapped
it
on
his
head
with
delight
the
hat
is
a
puzzling
invention
ambassador
khawksworth
arangbar
stumbled
over
the
pronunciation
of
the
name
as
he
signaled
for
a
mirror
what
purpose
it
serves
i
have
never
understood
you
i
observe
do
not
wear
one
yourself
hats
are
not
to
my
taste
may
it
please
your
majesty
hawksworth
bowed
again
and
then
continued
his
majesty
king
james
of
england
also
has
asked
me
to
deliver
a
portrait
of
himself
to
your
majesty
together
with
letter
expressing
his
desire
for
friendship
between
your
land
and
his
hawksworth
produced
a
small
framed
watercolor
from
the
wooden
chest
it
was
a
miniature
on
vellum
scarcely
more
than
an
inch
square
by
isaac
oliver
a
celebrated
artist
from
the
school
of
nicholas
hilliard
who
had
been
fashionable
under
queen
elizabeth
while
arangbar
examined
the
painting
scrutinizing
the
workmanship
as
might
a
connoisseur
hawksworth
reached
into
his
doublet
and
withdrew
the
letter
it
was
passed
to
nadir
sharif
who
presented
it
to
arangbar
the
moghul
reluctantly
handed
the
portrait
to
allaudin
then
inspected
the
leather
binding
of
the
letter
finally
he
broke
the
red
wax
seal
and
began
to
study
the
writing
a
quizzical
expression
spreading
over
his
face
the
seal
and
script
are
worthy
of
a
king
but
it
is
in
a
language
of
europe
there
are
two
copies
your
majesty
one
in
english
the
language
of
my
king
and
one
in
spanish
a
language
something
like
the
portugals
speak
then
we
will
have
father
sarmento
translate
sarmento
moved
to
the
silver
railing
and
took
the
leatherbound
letter
with
a
distasteful
expression
he
examined
it
for
a
moment
and
then
began
to
read
it
silently
the
color
slowly
draining
from
his
face
what
message
does
your
king
send
ambassador
his
admiration
for
your
majesty
whose
reputation
has
reached
even
europe
and
his
offer
of
full
and
open
trade
between
your
nation
and
his
the
letter
is
basely
penned
your
majesty
sarmento
face
was
red
with
dismay
as
he
turned
to
arangbar
its
style
is
unworthy
of
a
great
prince
arangbar
examined
the
jesuit
with
a
troubled
gaze
and
shifted
on
his
throne
may
it
please
your
majesty
this
man
is
the
enemy
of
england
hawksworth
pointed
at
sarmento
how
can
my
king
letter
be
penned
when
he
entreats
your
majesty
friendship
arangbar
paused
a
moment
and
then
he
smiled
broadly
a
reasonable
reply
the
inglish
i
see
are
a
race
he
glanced
at
sarmento
and
we
have
already
seen
their
seamanship
your
words
honor
my
king
your
majesty
hawksworth
found
himself
bowing
again
and
wondering
how
to
respond
we
would
hear
more
of
england
is
it
large
not
nearly
as
large
as
india
your
majesty
it
is
an
island
but
the
queen
of
all
the
islands
of
the
west
it
is
a
rocky
barren
speck
in
the
great
seas
of
europe
your
majesty
sarmento
interjected
himself
straining
to
hold
his
composure
a
breeder
of
drunken
fishermen
and
pirates
its
king
is
a
heretic
a
sovereign
of
lawless
privateers
and
an
enemy
of
the
holy
church
it
is
a
noble
land
your
majesty
ruled
by
a
free
king
not
by
a
spanish
tyrant
or
an
italian
pope
like
the
land
of
the
portugals
our
cannon
are
the
best
in
the
world
our
ships
the
swiftest
our
men
the
bravest
no
flag
but
our
own
has
ever
flown
above
our
soil
our
ships
have
sailed
all
the
seas
of
the
world
from
the
east
to
the
west
my
king
seamen
have
explored
the
seas
north
of
england
searching
for
a
northeast
passage
to
the
indies
and
the
americas
searching
for
a
northwest
passage
off
your
own
shores
we
have
met
the
galleons
of
portugal
as
your
majesty
must
know
and
in
the
west
indies
we
have
challenged
and
overcome
the
carracks
of
papist
spain
there
brave
english
captains
named
hawkins
and
drake
stood
off
spaniards
ten
times
their
number
the
very
name
of
england
strikes
fear
in
the
heart
of
a
portugal
or
a
spaniard
arangbar
toyed
with
the
jeweled
whistle
as
he
listened
your
england
interests
us
ambassador
khawksworth
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
reviewed
the
small
dispiriting
assemblage
of
gifts
we
would
know
when
your
king
next
voyage
will
be
very
soon
may
it
please
your
majesty
hawksworth
squirmed
and
noticed
nadir
sharif
suddenly
edge
closer
to
listen
but
your
king
must
send
out
voyages
regularly
we
have
heard
of
the
english
traders
in
our
southern
seas
do
you
not
know
when
the
next
voyage
will
be
or
what
gifts
your
king
is
preparing
surely
he
will
send
them
this
year
may
it
please
your
majesty
hawksworth
fumbled
with
the
railing
trying
to
gain
time
i
prince
parwaz
suddenly
plucked
at
arangbar
arm
and
pointed
into
the
crowd
a
tall
bearded
man
with
a
vast
turban
and
two
ornate
swords
at
his
side
had
moved
next
to
the
silver
railing
near
hawksworth
holding
a
petition
in
his
hand
he
is
the
man
i
spoke
of
yesterday
parwaz
spoke
in
turki
and
his
words
seemed
slurred
hawksworth
realized
he
was
tipsy
i
told
him
to
bring
his
petition
today
personally
he
a
commander
with
the
rank
of
a
thousand
horse
his
stipend
is
eight
thousand
rupees
a
month
he
claims
he
has
served
honorably
most
recently
in
the
siege
of
qandahar
but
that
he
must
resign
his
and
dismiss
his
men
and
horse
unless
his
stipend
is
increased
arangbar
examined
the
man
for
a
moment
then
addressed
him
in
turki
what
is
your
name
and
rank
i
am
amanat
mubarik
your
majesty
i
maintain
a
thousand
horse
the
finest
arabian
blood
in
india
the
man
stood
straight
and
spoke
with
a
loud
clear
voice
is
not
your
stipend
the
amount
prescribed
any
man
who
maintains
that
number
it
is
your
highness
but
i
am
not
any
man
i
am
a
pathan
and
my
father
was
fath
shah
no
enemy
of
your
majesty
has
ever
seen
the
back
of
my
shield
his
highness
prince
parwaz
saw
me
defend
the
royal
encampment
five
years
ago
when
he
moved
south
of
the
narbada
with
my
cavalry
i
held
position
when
all
others
called
for
retreat
i
challenge
any
man
here
today
to
do
me
battle
in
your
presence
with
any
weapon
on
horseback
or
on
foot
then
you
may
decide
if
i
am
as
other
men
the
moghul
examined
him
carefully
for
a
long
moment
if
you
are
not
like
other
men
then
i
will
let
you
prove
it
arangbar
pointed
beyond
the
marble
porticoes
will
you
fight
with
the
lion
the
pathan
commander
turned
and
stared
blankly
into
the
sunlit
square
where
the
captured
lion
was
snarling
and
pawing
at
its
chains
a
lion
is
a
wild
beast
your
majesty
what
trial
is
it
for
a
man
to
contest
with
a
lion
i
think
it
would
be
the
best
trial
of
all
arangbar
eyes
began
to
glow
a
beast
has
no
understanding
majesty
he
shifted
nervously
as
he
realized
arangbar
was
not
jesting
it
not
a
fit
thing
for
a
man
to
fight
you
will
joust
with
him
the
fancy
seemed
to
flood
arangbar
with
pleasure
and
he
turned
abruptly
to
one
of
the
guards
give
him
a
glove
and
a
truncheon
that
should
suffice
for
a
man
who
claims
bravery
above
all
others
hawksworth
watched
in
disbelief
as
the
dazed
commander
was
led
from
the
and
into
the
quadrangle
a
murmur
of
amazement
passed
through
the
crowd
the
square
cleared
quickly
as
the
lion
was
brought
forward
by
its
keepers
still
incredulous
the
pathan
slowly
pulled
the
heavy
glove
onto
his
left
hand
then
he
took
the
truncheon
no
more
than
a
foot
and
a
half
long
in
his
right
guards
took
his
swords
and
turban
and
in
moments
he
and
the
lion
were
faced
off
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
hawksworth
forced
himself
to
watch
as
the
commander
began
to
spar
with
the
lion
a
young
male
with
powerful
claws
he
managed
to
cudgel
the
lion
several
times
with
the
effect
that
it
became
more
enraged
than
harmed
then
with
a
roar
it
sprang
pulling
free
of
its
keepers
and
they
went
down
together
rolling
in
the
dust
of
the
square
the
pathan
continued
to
bravely
cudgel
the
lion
even
while
its
claws
ripped
across
his
face
and
arms
hawksworth
watched
the
lion
hard
tail
whip
for
balance
as
it
pawed
again
and
again
at
the
truncheon
suddenly
the
man
pulled
free
of
its
grasp
and
with
a
wide
arcing
swing
brought
the
truncheon
directly
across
the
crown
of
the
head
its
rear
haunches
clawed
upward
spastically
and
then
it
pitched
unconscious
into
the
bloody
dust
its
body
still
twitching
a
cheer
rose
from
the
crowd
of
onlookers
as
the
pathan
slowly
drew
himself
erect
hawksworth
realized
that
the
right
side
of
his
face
had
been
completely
ripped
away
by
the
lion
sharp
claws
he
made
a
few
halting
steps
toward
the
wheeled
dizzily
and
collapsed
in
a
pool
of
blood
he
was
dead
by
the
time
the
guards
reached
him
arangbar
had
watched
in
spellbound
delight
he
clapped
his
hands
and
turned
to
parwaz
whose
glazed
eyes
seemed
not
to
have
fully
comprehended
the
spectacle
astounding
i
never
knew
a
man
could
kill
a
lion
with
a
mere
club
he
was
braver
than
he
knew
if
he
has
sons
i
will
allow
them
to
keep
half
his
estate
arangbar
turned
to
the
guard
captain
standing
by
the
curtained
entrance
tomorrow
select
ten
of
your
best
men
and
we
will
bring
more
lions
what
better
test
of
bravery
the
uniformed
men
standing
at
attention
around
the
perimeter
of
the
all
blanched
but
their
eyes
remained
fixed
straight
ahead
then
arangbar
suddenly
remembered
hawksworth
does
england
have
men
as
brave
as
ours
ambassador
hawksworth
felt
a
cold
sweat
in
his
palms
no
man
in
england
would
dare
challenge
one
of
your
majesty
lions
arangbar
laughed
loudly
before
he
could
respond
the
was
whispering
in
his
ear
he
glanced
at
the
marble
screen
directly
behind
his
throne
and
nodded
then
he
turned
to
hawksworth
we
are
called
away
ambassador
i
told
i
must
take
my
afternoon
rest
this
is
the
time
of
day
i
retire
to
the
for
one
he
winked
and
gestured
toward
the
marble
screen
her
majesty
rules
our
time
but
i
want
to
speak
more
with
you
today
about
this
island
of
england
and
about
your
king
schedule
for
trade
you
will
attend
me
in
the
this
evening
as
your
majesty
pleases
as
arangbar
rose
his
eye
caught
the
painting
he
picked
it
up
and
scrutinized
it
then
turned
to
hawksworth
is
this
a
fair
example
of
inglish
painting
it
came
from
the
school
of
a
celebrated
artist
your
majesty
his
majesty
king
james
sat
to
have
it
painted
especially
for
you
hawksworth
sensed
that
arangbar
had
taken
more
interest
in
the
painting
than
in
any
of
the
other
gifts
except
perhaps
the
hat
the
painters
of
england
are
the
finest
in
the
world
the
moghul
stirred
slightly
and
then
summoned
a
small
wiry
man
with
heavy
brows
from
the
first
row
of
courtiers
he
briskly
moved
to
the
front
and
salaamed
to
arangbar
the
moghul
passed
the
painting
to
him
and
together
they
studied
it
conversing
quietly
in
persian
then
arangbar
turned
to
hawksworth
we
have
a
school
of
artists
here
in
the
palace
ambassador
khawksworth
this
man
who
directs
the
school
says
this
background
is
too
dark
the
eyes
lifeless
and
it
is
neither
quarter
nor
full
face
as
is
our
proven
convention
consequently
it
gives
no
sense
of
your
king
depth
of
character
arangbar
smiled
he
also
says
the
portraits
he
and
his
men
execute
are
far
more
difficult
they
catch
the
soul
of
the
man
not
merely
his
physical
likeness
may
it
please
your
majesty
i
can
not
accept
what
he
says
arangbar
translated
to
the
artist
who
replied
quickly
in
persian
casting
a
quick
contemptuous
glance
at
hawksworth
he
declares
he
could
easily
duplicate
this
simple
portrait
of
your
king
in
a
likeness
so
exact
you
could
not
tell
his
copy
from
the
original
such
a
thing
is
not
possible
your
majesty
no
man
in
the
world
could
execute
this
exact
painting
save
the
man
who
first
put
in
on
paper
arangbar
again
translated
for
his
painter
who
replied
animatedly
my
chief
painter
says
he
and
his
workshop
could
easily
produce
four
copies
of
this
any
one
of
which
would
pass
for
the
original
may
it
please
your
majesty
i
say
it
is
impossible
european
painting
is
a
centuries
old
tradition
requiring
years
of
apprenticeship
and
study
the
men
around
hawksworth
had
begun
to
shift
uncomfortably
the
moghul
was
never
contradicted
yet
he
seemed
to
relish
the
dispute
then
we
set
a
wager
what
will
you
wager
me
ambassador
that
i
can
make
this
one
painting
of
your
king
into
five
i
know
not
what
to
lay
with
so
great
a
prince
nor
does
it
befit
me
to
name
a
sum
to
your
majesty
hawksworth
shifted
uneasily
unsure
of
the
protocol
of
betting
with
kings
then
if
you
not
wager
with
me
wager
with
my
painter
begging
your
majesty
pardon
your
painter
is
no
more
suited
to
wager
with
an
ambassador
than
i
am
to
wager
with
your
majesty
then
wager
with
my
prime
minister
he
turned
to
nadir
sharif
what
will
you
lay
five
thousand
gold
mohurs
majesty
hawksworth
swallowed
hard
realizing
the
amount
was
almost
ten
thousand
pounds
english
sterling
more
money
than
he
had
ever
seen
money
is
not
an
honorable
bet
among
those
who
speak
for
great
princes
your
majesty
hawksworth
glanced
about
wildly
then
an
idea
came
but
perhaps
i
could
wager
your
prime
minister
a
horse
a
fine
arabian
stallion
done
arangbar
beamed
i
have
the
paintings
tonight
the
painter
stared
at
arangbar
in
dismay
it
not
possible
majesty
there
not
time
you
find
a
way
or
you
owe
nadir
sharif
a
horse
arangbar
passed
the
painting
back
to
the
painter
and
whirled
with
a
flourish
to
leave
around
hawksworth
the
nobles
all
bowed
to
the
ground
hawksworth
turned
quickly
to
scan
the
back
of
the
crowd
but
vasant
rao
had
disappeared
then
guards
surrounded
him
and
before
he
knew
what
was
happening
he
was
swept
past
sarmento
whose
eyes
still
glowed
with
hatred
toward
a
marble
doorway
at
the
corner
of
the
chapter
seventeen
ambassador
hawksworth
his
majesty
has
asked
me
to
ensure
you
are
wanting
in
nothing
while
you
wait
nadir
sharif
was
standing
on
the
wide
marble
balcony
when
hawksworth
emerged
from
the
stairs
that
led
upward
from
the
to
the
interior
courtyard
of
the
palace
he
salaamed
with
practiced
dignity
even
as
his
darting
eyes
assessed
hawksworth
in
a
quick
sweep
as
prime
minister
for
his
majesty
it
is
my
duty
indeed
my
pleasure
to
attend
your
comfort
and
acquaint
you
with
our
protocol
i
thank
you
on
behalf
of
his
majesty
king
james
hawksworth
awkwardly
tried
to
salaam
in
return
careful
not
to
bend
as
low
as
the
prime
minister
perhaps
i
can
begin
by
acquainting
you
with
the
palace
he
gestured
toward
the
open
courtyard
where
workmen
thronged
installing
marble
fountains
and
the
rest
of
the
encircling
balcony
the
stalls
below
us
are
where
the
wives
of
merchants
sometimes
come
to
offer
finery
to
the
women
of
the
now
they
are
being
readied
for
his
majesty
birthday
celebration
and
there
across
the
way
he
pointed
to
a
massive
silk
canopy
covering
a
pavilion
opposite
the
square
on
the
riverside
of
the
palace
is
the
where
his
majesty
holds
his
evening
gatherings
to
the
left
are
his
baths
and
on
the
right
projecting
out
over
the
river
is
the
jasmine
tower
of
queen
janahara
now
please
follow
me
his
majesty
has
honored
you
by
inviting
you
to
wait
for
him
in
the
the
only
other
to
see
it
are
the
jesuits
he
sometimes
invites
here
to
debate
with
the
mullahs
around
them
the
marble
porticoes
had
been
carved
in
relief
a
profusion
of
flowers
and
vines
creating
a
monochromatic
garden
in
stone
the
floors
were
patterned
marble
and
the
walls
decorated
with
hanging
tapestries
as
they
entered
the
noticed
its
floor
was
covered
with
a
vast
persian
carpet
over
which
had
been
scattered
bolsters
and
pillows
for
lounging
on
the
side
nearest
the
interior
square
was
a
platform
in
white
marble
and
on
the
opposite
side
facing
a
gallery
overlooking
the
arena
below
and
the
jamuna
river
beyond
was
a
similar
platform
in
black
marble
both
were
padded
with
rich
carpets
his
majesty
uses
the
white
throne
in
evenings
and
the
black
in
the
afternoons
when
he
sometimes
comes
here
to
watch
elephant
fights
in
the
square
below
the
doorway
there
leads
to
her
majesty
apartments
where
is
his
majesty
now
he
has
retired
to
the
one
three
hours
where
he
dines
on
roasted
meats
some
wine
and
passes
the
time
agreeably
each
afternoon
her
majesty
selects
a
woman
for
him
moghul
smiled
naturally
it
never
the
same
one
her
majesty
is
always
first
in
his
heart
but
she
never
allows
his
wanton
affections
to
wander
afterward
he
comes
here
for
his
evening
gathering
nadir
sharif
walked
to
the
gallery
and
looked
down
on
the
river
far
below
on
the
opposite
bank
a
caravan
of
heavily
loaded
camels
passed
silently
by
the
way
his
majesty
has
asked
me
to
inquire
if
you
have
a
lodging
yet
ambassador
i
have
references
for
brokers
and
tomorrow
i
begin
to
look
and
personal
servants
i
hoped
they
be
provided
with
the
house
his
majesty
may
wish
to
arrange
lodgings
for
you
nadir
sharif
turned
back
toward
hawksworth
and
paused
for
a
moment
before
continuing
in
agra
ambassadors
must
acquire
their
lodgings
and
servants
with
care
there
is
regrettably
a
certain
amount
of
intrigue
in
our
city
trustworthy
and
efficient
servants
are
not
always
the
easiest
thing
to
find
perhaps
i
should
raise
the
matter
of
your
lodging
and
servants
with
his
majesty
there
no
reason
to
trouble
his
majesty
i
contact
the
brokers
tomorrow
hawksworth
tone
was
level
but
firm
suspecting
that
any
servants
picked
for
him
would
be
spies
and
if
they
turned
out
to
be
trustworthy
and
efficient
rather
than
lazy
and
begrudging
there
would
be
no
doubt
the
matter
rests
with
his
majesty
nadir
sharif
watched
as
a
eunuch
entered
bearing
a
tray
with
glasses
of
a
followed
him
and
settled
in
the
corner
striking
up
a
tune
on
an
instrument
that
looked
like
a
bloated
violin
and
sounded
to
hawksworth
like
a
distressed
cat
have
you
engaged
an
agent
yet
ambassador
nadir
sharif
directed
the
tray
toward
hawksworth
what
do
you
mean
if
your
king
wishes
to
trade
large
quantities
of
commodity
he
will
certainly
require
an
agent
here
in
agra
to
ensure
that
documents
and
approvals
are
handled
efficiently
nadir
sharif
sighed
officials
here
naturally
prefer
to
work
with
someone
who
understands
their
requirements
an
agent
will
be
essential
if
your
king
expects
to
trade
heavily
nadir
sharif
paused
i
presume
that
is
his
intention
assuming
his
majesty
approves
the
hawksworth
examined
nadir
sharif
for
a
moment
assuming
he
was
offering
to
be
the
agent
for
king
james
or
was
he
merely
hoping
to
elicit
trade
information
to
pass
on
to
the
portuguese
i
engage
an
agent
when
the
time
seems
proper
for
now
i
have
no
then
a
light
suddenly
dawned
somewhere
in
brain
but
i
suppose
i
need
an
for
that
as
well
it
could
prove
useful
his
majesty
can
be
distressingly
absentminded
and
what
would
be
this
agent
fee
it
depends
on
the
difficulty
involved
nadir
sharif
face
remained
impassive
i
would
say
it
also
depends
on
whether
he
successful
so
it
would
but
he
would
need
more
information
on
english
trading
intentions
than
you
have
divulged
so
far
that
will
come
in
time
when
i
know
more
about
the
naturally
nadir
sharif
cleared
his
throat
but
enough
of
affairs
permit
me
to
toast
your
arrival
when
your
request
for
a
pass
arrived
from
surat
we
all
wondered
if
a
to
india
could
successfully
travel
our
roads
even
with
the
moghul
pass
he
took
a
delicate
sip
of
the
beverage
i
trust
your
journey
was
without
mishap
for
the
most
part
a
diplomatic
answer
but
you
seem
to
have
survived
all
parts
well
enough
did
you
take
the
burhanpur
road
i
did
ah
then
perhaps
you
passed
prince
jadar
i
understand
he
was
there
recently
nadir
sharif
smiled
disarmingly
i
always
welcome
news
of
him
you
may
know
he
married
to
my
first
daughter
mumtaz
i
hear
she
just
presented
him
with
his
first
son
he
was
in
burhanpur
when
i
arrived
but
i
was
only
there
for
three
days
not
a
very
interesting
city
i
told
but
they
say
the
deccan
itself
is
quite
beautiful
in
harvest
i
envy
you
your
trip
i
alas
rarely
can
escape
agra
except
when
his
majesty
goes
to
kashmir
in
the
heat
of
summer
nadir
sharif
signaled
the
eunuch
to
refill
hawksworth
cup
the
had
been
joined
by
a
drummer
who
took
up
a
slow
even
rhythm
did
i
understand
you
to
say
you
met
the
prince
while
you
were
there
hawksworth
hesitated
and
studied
nadir
sharif
not
remembering
he
had
mentioned
meeting
jadar
actually
i
did
see
him
briefly
once
he
was
in
the
fortress
where
i
stayed
ah
yes
the
fortress
that
was
wise
of
you
considering
the
situation
now
i
pleased
he
invited
you
to
join
him
as
it
happened
i
traveled
from
surat
with
men
from
his
guard
their
destination
was
the
fortress
his
guards
then
you
were
most
fortunate
indeed
nadir
sharif
seemed
to
listen
absently
to
the
melody
for
a
moment
i
always
a
bit
stupid
about
military
campaigns
what
would
men
from
his
guards
be
doing
in
surat
hawksworth
heard
an
inner
alarm
suddenly
sound
i
think
they
were
there
to
accompany
a
convoy
a
convoy
from
surat
odd
but
then
i
rarely
understand
these
things
what
was
it
bringing
nadir
sharif
chuckled
congenially
barrels
of
persian
wine
for
the
prince
i
would
venture
to
guess
i
understand
it
was
lead
for
shot
nadir
sharif
gave
hawksworth
a
quick
troubled
glance
i
see
yes
lead
would
require
a
guard
but
prince
jadar
rajputs
virtually
scorn
to
use
muskets
so
i
assume
it
was
rather
a
small
number
of
carts
hawksworth
straightened
his
doublet
shifting
the
location
of
vasant
rao
katar
i
do
recall
the
precise
number
naturally
i
confused
by
numbers
myself
probably
something
like
twenty
i
suppose
certainly
i
would
presume
no
more
than
fifty
i
did
count
the
exact
number
too
many
to
count
i
see
nadir
sharif
seemed
to
be
only
half
attentive
to
the
conversation
as
he
swung
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
appreciation
of
the
accelerating
tempo
of
the
drummer
doubtless
it
was
some
of
the
very
lead
i
told
you
brought
for
trade
it
was
english
ah
then
i
suppose
it
was
portuguese
i
assume
you
must
have
noticed
not
actually
hawksworth
paused
it
was
really
my
concern
yes
quite
so
nadir
sharif
walked
again
to
the
gallery
and
stood
silent
still
swinging
his
head
absently
to
the
time
of
the
music
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
had
already
dropped
into
place
so
that
how
jadar
did
it
and
only
one
man
in
surat
could
have
provided
the
prince
the
silver
he
needed
that
contemptible
son
of
a
moneylender
mirza
nuruddin
he
uncontrollable
but
even
if
the
prince
survives
the
deccan
what
can
he
do
the
imperial
army
allah
it
obvious
there
only
one
way
he
can
ever
march
north
with
enough
men
to
meet
janahara
army
by
the
merciful
prophet
he
mad
nadir
sharif
coughed
lightly
and
turned
back
toward
the
room
ambassador
hawksworth
would
you
care
for
some
wine
you
need
not
be
squeamish
his
majesty
has
always
admired
men
who
drink
i
would
join
you
but
regrettably
i
can
not
while
his
majesty
retires
the
rest
of
us
must
labor
on
a
glass
would
be
welcome
a
glass
ambassador
did
you
say
glass
nadir
sharif
laughed
you
need
more
than
a
glass
if
you
drink
with
his
majesty
i
send
the
servants
he
bowed
again
at
the
doorway
of
the
vestibule
rejoin
you
when
i
can
in
the
meantime
summon
the
eunuchs
if
you
require
anything
he
turned
and
was
gone
in
what
seemed
only
moments
two
turbaned
servants
appeared
smiling
as
they
placed
a
large
chalice
of
wine
on
the
carpet
next
to
hawksworth
bolster
it
all
too
incredible
queen
janahara
slumped
onto
a
velvet
divan
and
distractedly
took
a
rolled
betel
leaf
from
the
silver
tray
offered
by
a
hovering
eunuch
behind
her
a
female
fanned
a
plume
of
peacock
feathers
against
the
afternoon
heat
as
she
spoke
she
brushed
back
her
scarf
revealing
gleaming
dark
hair
the
few
gray
strands
had
been
perfectly
dyed
pulled
back
tightly
against
her
head
and
secured
with
a
golden
band
her
only
jewels
were
in
a
necklace
diamonds
with
a
massive
blue
sapphire
that
complemented
her
dark
eyes
she
was
nearing
fifty
but
still
possessed
of
a
beauty
that
had
with
the
years
evolved
to
magnificent
dignity
her
face
was
statuesque
and
her
persian
was
both
elegant
and
mellifluous
still
marching
south
i
think
he
actually
enjoys
living
in
the
field
surrounded
by
mud
and
rajputs
how
much
longer
can
he
continue
be
assured
this
time
the
prince
will
bring
his
own
undoing
nadir
sharif
accepted
a
betel
leaf
from
the
tray
a
gesture
and
absently
rolled
it
between
his
thumb
and
finger
he
wondered
nervously
why
she
had
summoned
him
to
the
jasmine
tower
the
minute
he
left
the
english
he
normally
enjoyed
meeting
her
there
amid
the
marble
screens
where
they
could
recline
on
the
carpeted
terrace
and
admire
the
broad
jamuna
as
her
brother
and
prime
minister
it
was
not
unseemly
for
him
to
visit
her
in
her
quarters
the
campaign
in
the
deccan
will
change
everything
your
majesty
it
can
not
end
as
did
the
last
one
with
malik
ambar
surrendering
out
of
fright
the
abyssinian
surely
suspects
by
now
that
jadar
is
isolated
queen
janahara
was
no
longer
listening
her
thoughts
were
seething
over
the
two
surprises
of
the
day
the
first
was
nadir
sharif
absence
from
her
historic
appearance
at
the
she
had
already
been
informed
of
his
absence
by
four
separate
eunuchs
all
assumed
it
was
deliberate
nadir
sharif
my
own
brother
can
he
be
wavering
or
merely
bargaining
why
has
something
happened
with
jadar
the
march
south
should
have
been
the
end
of
him
the
their
troops
south
of
the
narbada
were
in
shambles
but
somehow
jadar
has
managed
to
recall
enough
cavalry
to
continue
his
campaign
what
is
he
planning
that
question
called
to
mind
the
second
problem
of
the
day
the
englishman
she
knew
as
arangbar
did
not
that
the
englishman
had
already
met
with
jadar
why
had
jadar
contrived
such
a
meeting
the
prince
must
know
that
both
she
and
nadir
sharif
had
full
support
of
the
viceroy
of
goa
did
he
also
know
that
the
viceroy
had
even
offered
secretly
to
help
arm
the
deccanis
against
him
an
arrangement
she
was
now
negotiating
what
of
the
english
his
letter
his
meeting
with
jadar
she
had
studied
him
carefully
through
her
screen
when
he
appeared
at
the
afternoon
she
had
ordered
a
persian
translation
of
his
letter
prepared
immediately
and
what
she
read
was
disturbing
the
english
king
had
it
was
true
asked
merely
for
a
trading
but
who
knew
what
sea
power
waited
behind
the
english
appearance
at
surat
she
knew
jadar
despised
christians
but
he
would
not
scruple
to
use
them
one
against
the
other
where
would
it
lead
if
jadar
could
enlist
english
sea
power
in
the
struggle
that
loomed
ahead
and
somehow
neutralize
the
influence
of
the
portuguese
maddeningly
the
moghul
seemed
amused
by
the
englishman
by
his
rude
manner
why
did
his
majesty
invite
the
the
khas
my
esteemed
sister
you
were
at
today
durbar
you
know
his
whims
far
better
than
i
perhaps
he
was
fascinated
by
finding
a
speaks
his
barbarous
turki
for
his
majesty
the
new
be
anything
more
than
merely
a
new
toy
like
a
new
dog
or
horse
he
will
amuse
himself
with
the
dangle
promises
before
him
and
wait
to
see
if
more
gifts
are
forthcoming
you
know
he
is
the
same
with
all
ambassadors
this
one
i
think
is
different
did
you
see
him
refuse
to
i
think
his
majesty
is
already
awed
by
him
i
fear
for
india
if
the
english
ever
gain
influence
here
do
you
really
believe
the
english
king
wants
nothing
more
than
trade
janahara
found
herself
searching
for
the
key
to
nadir
sharifs
thoughts
what
do
you
suppose
would
happen
if
these
english
defy
the
portuguese
and
one
day
decide
to
blockade
surat
to
allow
trade
only
to
those
who
have
supported
them
at
court
she
paused
as
she
studied
him
could
there
be
some
here
already
who
are
fearful
enough
to
pretend
friendship
to
the
englishman
who
could
know
these
things
nadir
sharif
walked
to
the
white
marble
railing
and
gazed
along
the
side
of
the
fort
where
the
jamuna
lapped
gently
against
the
thick
red
walls
he
remembered
his
pigeons
and
then
he
remembered
the
morning
and
janahara
unprecedented
appearance
the
englishman
is
hardly
a
problem
my
dear
sister
he
is
already
tamed
you
are
the
problem
now
you
and
your
newfound
power
but
if
you
fear
this
harmless
more
than
you
fear
me
then
i
have
at
last
found
a
way
to
manage
you
as
well
at
long
last
tonight
i
will
drink
with
the
english
and
then
we
may
learn
something
useful
a
man
lounging
with
a
wine
cup
in
his
hands
says
things
he
would
never
utter
standing
at
i
think
his
majesty
may
also
be
wondering
about
the
intentions
of
his
king
janahara
chewed
silently
on
the
betel
leaf
and
eyed
him
knowing
he
had
met
that
morning
with
the
rajput
who
brought
the
english
agra
and
wondering
why
whatever
the
reason
she
told
herself
nadir
sharif
would
never
be
so
foolish
as
to
side
with
jadar
not
so
long
as
the
prince
was
isolated
and
weak
nadir
sharif
did
not
gamble
the
be
watched
closely
find
a
way
we
need
to
know
what
he
is
doing
what
he
is
thinking
do
you
understand
to
hear
is
to
obey
nadir
sharif
bowed
lightly
and
you
will
be
at
morning
even
if
you
were
not
there
today
naturally
had
i
but
known
majesty
father
made
you
prime
minister
you
can
be
just
as
easily
removed
your
majesty
nadir
sharif
bowed
and
with
an
unseen
flick
sent
the
rolled
betel
leaf
spinning
past
the
railing
toward
the
dark
waters
of
the
jamuna
below
hawksworth
sipped
from
the
new
cup
of
wine
his
third
and
watched
the
musicians
begin
to
retune
around
him
the
members
of
arangbar
inner
circle
were
assembling
in
the
this
must
be
evening
dress
in
agra
he
marveled
silk
turbans
studded
with
rubies
and
sapphires
diamond
earrings
swords
trimmed
in
gold
and
silver
pearl
necklaces
cloaks
of
rich
brocade
velvet
slippers
the
faces
around
him
all
betrayed
the
indolent
eyes
and
pasty
cheeks
of
men
long
indulged
in
rich
food
hard
spirits
sensuality
it
was
he
now
realized
the
fairyland
that
symmes
had
described
that
freezing
day
so
long
ago
in
the
offices
of
the
levant
company
what
man
not
a
papist
monk
could
resist
the
worldly
seductions
of
the
court
then
he
remembered
the
brave
pathan
who
had
been
torn
apart
by
a
lion
that
very
afternoon
while
all
arangbar
nobles
watched
unprotesting
on
the
signal
of
a
eunuch
standing
by
the
doorway
the
drummer
suddenly
pounded
out
a
loud
rhythmic
fanfare
and
then
the
sitarist
took
up
a
martial
motif
the
brocade
drapery
hanging
inside
a
marble
archway
at
the
back
of
the
room
was
drawn
aside
by
a
guard
and
a
moment
later
arangbar
swept
into
the
room
the
courtiers
all
bowed
in
the
rising
with
their
hands
on
their
forehead
arangbar
had
changed
to
evening
dress
he
wore
a
dark
velvet
turban
encrusted
with
jewels
patterned
trousers
beneath
a
transparent
muslin
skirt
and
a
gold
brocade
cinch
at
his
waist
he
clapped
his
hands
in
delight
when
he
saw
hawksworth
holding
a
wine
cup
the
ambassador
has
already
tasted
our
persian
wine
how
do
you
find
it
ambassador
khaw
he
stumbled
over
the
name
wait
the
first
thing
we
must
do
is
rename
you
henceforth
we
will
call
you
now
have
we
pronounced
that
properly
perfectly
your
majesty
and
so
please
your
majesty
the
wine
is
excellent
though
perhaps
not
as
sweet
as
the
wines
of
europe
every
the
same
inglish
but
we
will
civilize
you
and
also
teach
you
something
about
painting
he
seized
a
glass
of
wine
from
a
waiting
eunuch
and
then
shouted
to
nadir
sharif
who
had
entered
moments
before
from
the
back
where
are
my
five
paintings
i
told
they
will
be
ready
before
your
majesty
retires
the
painters
are
still
hard
at
work
so
please
your
majesty
it
does
not
please
me
but
then
i
have
no
wager
he
roared
with
amusement
your
stables
will
be
reduced
by
a
prize
stallion
come
morning
if
the
paintings
are
not
ready
soon
look
to
it
as
nadir
sharif
bowed
in
acknowledgment
arangbar
whirled
to
hawksworth
tell
me
something
about
your
king
inglish
how
many
wives
does
he
have
we
have
hundreds
he
has
but
one
your
majesty
and
i
believe
she
is
mostly
for
show
king
james
prefers
the
company
of
young
men
very
like
most
christians
i
met
and
you
inglish
have
you
any
wives
arangbar
had
already
finished
his
first
glass
of
wine
and
taken
a
second
i
have
none
your
majesty
but
you
i
suspect
are
not
a
jesuit
or
a
eunuch
no
your
majesty
then
we
shall
find
you
a
wife
inglish
he
took
a
ball
of
opium
and
washed
it
down
with
wine
no
we
will
find
you
two
yes
you
shall
be
well
wived
may
it
please
your
majesty
i
have
no
means
to
care
for
a
wife
i
am
here
for
only
a
season
hawksworth
shifted
uncomfortably
you
will
only
leave
agra
inglish
when
it
is
our
pleasure
but
if
you
will
not
have
a
wife
you
must
at
least
have
a
house
i
am
arranging
it
now
your
majesty
arangbar
looked
at
hawksworth
sharply
then
continued
as
though
he
had
not
heard
now
tell
us
more
about
your
king
we
would
know
what
he
like
hawksworth
bowed
as
he
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
the
wine
was
already
toying
with
his
brain
although
most
of
what
he
knew
about
king
james
was
hearsay
he
knew
he
did
not
care
for
england
new
king
overly
much
no
english
subject
did
and
idle
seamen
had
reason
to
dislike
him
the
most
of
all
he
was
not
the
sovereign
elizabeth
had
been
he
of
middle
stature
your
majesty
not
overly
fat
though
he
seems
so
since
he
always
wears
quilted
doublets
arangbar
seemed
surprised
is
he
not
safe
has
he
no
guards
he
a
prudent
man
your
majesty
as
befits
a
sovereign
and
hawksworth
thought
also
a
coward
if
you
believe
the
talk
in
london
what
all
men
know
for
fact
though
is
that
he
a
weakling
whose
legs
are
so
spindly
he
has
to
be
helped
to
walk
leaning
on
other
shoulders
while
he
fiddles
spastically
with
his
codpiece
does
your
king
wear
many
jewels
ambassador
inglish
of
course
your
majesty
hawksworth
drank
calmly
from
his
wine
cup
hoping
the
lie
would
pass
unnoticed
what
would
the
moghul
think
if
he
knew
the
truth
hawksworth
asked
himself
that
king
james
of
england
only
changes
his
clothes
when
they
are
rags
and
his
fashion
never
he
was
once
they
say
given
a
hat
and
he
cast
it
away
swearing
he
loved
neither
them
nor
their
fashions
another
time
he
was
given
shoes
with
brocade
roses
on
them
and
he
railed
at
the
giver
asking
if
he
was
to
be
made
a
dove
is
your
king
generous
of
nature
ambassador
we
are
loved
by
our
people
because
we
give
of
our
bounty
on
every
holy
day
baskets
of
silver
rupees
are
flung
down
the
streets
of
agra
king
james
is
giving
also
your
majesty
with
the
moneys
of
others
he
part
willingly
with
a
hundred
pounds
not
in
his
own
keeping
before
he
release
ten
shillings
from
his
private
purse
and
it
said
rather
spend
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
on
embassies
abroad
buying
peace
with
bribes
than
ten
thousand
on
an
army
that
would
enforce
peace
with
honor
he
is
a
man
among
men
your
majesty
admired
and
loved
by
all
his
subjects
as
are
we
ambassador
arangbar
took
another
ball
of
opium
and
washed
it
down
with
a
third
glass
of
wine
tell
me
does
your
king
drink
spirits
it
is
said
he
drinks
often
your
majesty
though
many
declare
it
is
more
out
of
custom
than
delight
he
drinks
strong
liquors
frontiniack
canary
high
canary
wine
tent
wine
scottish
ale
but
never
it
said
more
than
a
few
spoonfuls
then
he
could
never
drink
with
the
moghul
of
india
ambassador
we
have
twenty
cups
of
wine
a
night
and
twelve
grains
of
opium
arangbar
paused
as
he
accepted
yet
another
glass
his
voice
had
begun
to
slur
slightly
but
perhaps
your
king
can
trade
with
me
when
will
the
ships
from
your
king
next
voyage
arrive
and
how
many
of
your
frigates
will
we
see
yearly
if
we
grant
him
the
trading
requests
hawksworth
noticed
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
that
nadir
sharif
had
now
moved
directly
beside
him
the
prime
minister
held
a
glass
of
wine
from
which
he
sipped
delicately
around
him
the
other
courtiers
were
already
drinking
heavily
to
the
obvious
approval
of
arangbar
he
not
finish
a
single
glass
of
wine
if
my
guess
is
right
nadir
sharif
find
a
way
to
stay
stone
sober
while
the
rest
of
the
room
sinks
into
its
cups
and
they
all
be
too
drunk
to
notice
king
james
will
one
day
send
an
armada
of
frigates
your
majesty
keep
arangbar
mind
off
the
next
voyage
he
just
may
try
to
hold
you
here
until
it
comes
or
refuse
to
grant
a
he
sees
the
next
batch
of
presents
his
majesty
king
james
is
always
eager
to
trade
the
seas
where
his
ships
are
welcome
even
if
other
nations
of
europe
would
quarrel
with
his
rights
to
those
seas
england
has
no
quarrels
in
europe
your
majesty
if
you
refer
to
the
engagement
off
surat
you
should
know
that
was
caused
by
a
misunderstanding
of
the
treaties
that
now
exist
in
europe
england
is
at
peace
with
all
her
neighbors
a
skeptical
silence
seemed
to
envelop
the
room
arangbar
took
another
cup
of
wine
and
drank
it
off
then
he
turned
to
hawksworth
the
matter
ambassador
inglish
does
not
seem
to
us
to
be
that
simple
but
we
will
examine
it
more
later
nights
are
made
for
beauty
days
for
affairs
of
state
arangbar
voice
had
begun
to
slur
even
more
noticeably
you
may
have
heard
there
will
be
a
wedding
here
soon
my
youngest
prince
is
betrothed
to
the
daughter
of
my
queen
the
wedding
will
be
held
one
month
after
my
own
birthday
celebration
and
it
will
be
an
event
to
remember
tonight
i
begin
the
task
of
selecting
the
women
who
will
dance
do
you
know
anything
of
indian
dance
very
little
your
majesty
i
have
only
seen
it
once
in
surat
at
a
gathering
one
evening
at
the
palace
of
the
shahbandar
arangbar
roared
and
seized
another
glass
of
wine
i
can
well
imagine
the
kind
of
entertainment
the
shahbandar
of
surat
provides
for
his
guests
no
ambassador
i
mean
the
real
dance
of
india
the
dance
of
great
artists
perhaps
you
have
classical
dance
in
england
no
your
majesty
we
have
nothing
similar
at
least
similar
to
the
dance
i
saw
then
a
pleasant
surprise
awaits
you
arangbar
examined
cup
and
motioned
for
a
servant
to
refill
it
drink
up
inglish
the
evening
is
only
beginning
arangbar
clapped
drunkenly
and
the
guests
began
to
settle
themselves
around
the
bolsters
that
had
been
strewn
about
the
carpet
an
ornate
silk
pillow
was
provided
for
each
man
to
rest
against
and
a
number
of
large
hookahs
each
with
several
mouthpieces
were
lighted
and
stationed
about
the
room
the
servants
also
distributed
garlands
of
yellow
flowers
and
as
nadir
sharif
took
his
place
next
to
hawksworth
he
wrapped
one
of
the
garlands
about
his
left
wrist
with
the
other
hand
he
set
down
his
wineglass
still
full
and
signaled
a
servant
to
replenish
hawksworth
arangbar
was
reclining
now
on
the
throne
against
his
own
bolster
and
the
oil
lamps
around
the
side
of
the
room
were
lowered
leaving
illumination
only
on
the
musicians
and
on
a
bare
spot
in
the
center
of
the
carpet
the
air
was
rich
with
the
aroma
of
roses
as
servants
passed
shaking
rosewater
on
the
guests
from
necked
silver
decanters
the
musicians
were
completing
their
tuning
and
hawksworth
noticed
that
now
there
were
two
drummers
a
sitar
player
and
a
new
musician
holding
a
in
the
background
another
man
sat
methodically
strumming
a
simple
upright
instrument
shaped
like
the
sitar
save
it
provided
nothing
more
than
a
droning
against
which
the
other
instruments
had
been
tuned
next
a
man
entered
wearing
a
simple
white
shirt
and
settled
himself
on
the
carpet
in
front
of
the
musicians
as
silence
gripped
the
room
arangbar
signaled
to
the
seated
man
with
his
wineglass
and
the
man
began
to
sing
a
low
soulful
melody
that
seemed
to
consist
of
only
a
few
syllables
ga
ma
the
voice
soared
upward
da
ni
sa
after
a
few
moments
hawksworth
guessed
he
must
be
singing
the
names
of
the
notes
in
the
indian
scale
they
were
virtually
identical
to
the
western
scale
except
certain
notes
seemed
to
be
a
few
microtones
higher
or
lower
depending
whether
approached
from
ascent
or
descent
the
singer
voice
soared
slowly
upward
in
pitch
and
volume
growing
more
intense
as
it
quavered
around
certain
of
the
high
notes
while
the
sarangi
player
listened
attentively
and
bowed
the
exact
notes
he
sang
always
seeming
to
guess
which
note
he
would
find
next
the
song
was
melodic
and
gradually
what
had
at
first
seemed
almost
a
dirge
grew
to
be
a
poignant
line
of
beauty
suddenly
the
singer
voice
cut
the
air
with
a
phrase
which
was
brief
and
immediately
repeated
the
second
time
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
drum
as
both
players
picked
up
the
notes
on
the
third
repetition
of
the
phrase
the
curtains
on
arangbar
right
were
swept
aside
and
a
young
woman
seemed
to
fairly
burst
across
the
room
her
every
skipping
step
announced
by
a
band
of
tiny
bells
bound
around
her
ankles
and
across
the
tops
of
her
bare
feet
as
she
spun
into
the
light
she
whirled
a
fast
pirouette
that
sent
her
long
braided
pigtail
so
long
the
end
was
attached
to
her
waist
whistling
in
an
arc
behind
her
her
flowered
silk
tunic
flew
outward
from
her
spinning
body
revealing
all
of
her
white
trousers
she
wore
a
crown
of
jewels
straight
pendant
earrings
of
emerald
and
an
long
string
of
diamonds
dangled
from
the
center
of
her
nose
she
paused
for
an
instant
whirled
toward
arangbar
and
performed
a
her
right
hand
fingers
slightly
bent
thumb
across
her
palm
as
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
forehead
the
movement
was
possessed
of
so
much
grace
it
seemed
a
perfect
dance
figure
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
interpreting
for
you
ambassador
nadir
sharif
ignored
the
hookah
mouthpiece
that
another
slightly
tipsy
guest
was
urging
on
him
and
slid
closer
to
hawksworth
kathak
is
an
art
like
painting
or
best
appreciated
when
you
know
the
rules
he
pointed
toward
the
dancer
her
name
is
sangeeta
and
she
has
just
performed
the
invocation
for
the
hindus
it
is
a
salute
to
their
god
ganesh
for
muslims
it
is
a
next
she
turned
slowly
toward
the
guests
and
struck
a
pose
one
foot
crossed
behind
the
other
arms
bent
as
though
holding
a
drawn
bow
as
the
a
slow
tuneful
melody
she
seemed
to
control
the
rhythm
of
the
drums
by
quietly
stroking
together
again
and
again
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
each
hand
the
explosive
tension
in
her
body
seemed
focused
entirely
in
this
single
virtually
imperceptible
motion
almost
as
a
glass
marshals
the
power
of
the
sun
to
a
tiny
point
then
her
eyes
began
to
dart
from
side
to
side
and
first
one
eyebrow
and
then
the
other
lifted
seductively
gradually
the
rhythm
was
taken
up
by
her
head
as
it
began
to
glide
from
side
to
side
in
a
subtle
elegant
expression
that
seemed
an
extension
of
the
music
she
had
possessed
the
room
almost
as
a
spirit
of
pure
dance
chaste
powerful
disciplined
and
there
was
nothing
of
the
overt
suggestiveness
of
the
nautch
dancers
of
the
shahbandar
courtyard
she
wore
a
tight
vest
of
brocade
over
a
silk
shirt
and
of
her
body
only
her
hands
feet
and
face
were
visible
it
was
these
hawksworth
realized
not
her
body
that
were
the
elements
of
kathak
dance
now
she
begin
the
second
section
of
the
dance
it
the
introduction
and
corresponds
to
the
opening
of
a
raga
it
sets
the
atmosphere
and
makes
you
long
for
more
i
know
of
no
has
ever
seen
kathak
but
perhaps
you
can
understand
do
you
feel
it
hawksworth
sipped
his
wine
slowly
and
tried
to
clear
his
head
in
truth
he
felt
very
little
save
the
intensity
that
seemed
to
be
held
in
check
it
appears
to
be
rather
subtle
very
little
seems
to
be
happening
hawksworth
drank
again
and
found
himself
longing
for
a
lively
hornpipe
a
great
deal
will
happen
ambassador
and
very
soon
in
india
you
must
learn
patience
almost
at
that
moment
the
drummers
erupted
with
a
dense
rhythmic
cycle
and
the
up
a
single
repetitive
phrase
sangeeta
looked
directly
at
hawksworth
and
called
out
a
complex
series
of
rhythmic
syllables
in
a
melodic
if
slightly
strident
voice
all
the
while
duplicating
the
exact
pattern
of
sounds
by
slapping
the
soles
of
her
feet
against
the
carpet
then
she
glided
across
the
carpet
in
a
series
of
syncopated
foot
movements
saluting
each
of
the
guests
in
turn
and
calling
out
strings
of
syllables
after
which
she
would
dance
a
sequence
that
replicated
the
rhythm
exactly
her
feet
a
precise
percussion
instrument
the
syllables
she
recites
are
called
ambassador
which
are
the
names
of
the
many
different
strokes
on
the
tabla
drums
drummers
sometimes
call
out
a
sequence
before
they
play
it
she
does
the
same
except
she
uses
her
feet
almost
as
a
drummer
uses
his
hands
as
hawksworth
watched
sangeeta
called
strings
of
syllables
that
were
increasingly
longer
and
more
complex
he
could
not
understand
the
or
perceive
the
rhythms
as
she
danced
them
but
the
drunken
men
around
him
were
smiling
and
swinging
their
heads
from
side
to
side
in
what
he
took
to
be
appreciative
approval
suddenly
arangbar
shouted
something
to
her
and
pointed
toward
the
first
drummer
the
drummer
beamed
nodded
and
as
sangeeta
watched
called
out
a
dense
series
of
then
she
proceeded
to
dance
the
sequence
with
her
feet
the
room
exploded
with
cries
of
appreciation
when
she
finished
the
sequence
and
hawksworth
assumed
she
had
managed
to
capture
the
instructions
the
musician
had
called
then
arangbar
pointed
to
the
other
drummer
and
he
also
called
out
a
string
of
which
again
sangeeta
repeated
finally
the
singer
called
a
rhythm
sequence
the
most
complex
yet
and
both
dancer
and
drummer
repeated
them
precisely
together
as
the
tempo
became
wilder
sangeeta
began
a
series
of
lightning
spins
still
pounding
the
carpet
with
her
reddened
soles
and
in
time
she
seemed
to
transform
into
a
whirling
top
her
pigtail
loose
now
and
singing
through
the
air
like
a
deadly
whip
she
had
become
a
blur
and
for
a
brief
moment
she
appeared
to
have
two
heads
hawksworth
watched
in
wonder
and
sipped
from
his
wine
cup
now
she
begin
the
last
part
ambassador
the
most
demanding
of
all
the
rhythm
became
almost
a
frenzy
now
then
as
suddenly
as
they
had
begun
the
whirls
ended
sangeeta
struck
a
statuesque
pose
arms
extended
in
rigid
curves
and
began
a
display
of
intensely
rhythmic
footwork
her
body
seemed
frozen
in
space
as
nothing
moved
save
her
feet
the
bells
on
her
ankles
became
a
continuous
chime
increasing
in
tempo
with
the
drum
and
the
the
rhythmic
phrase
itself
was
nothing
more
than
a
dense
blur
of
notes
suddenly
the
drummer
and
instrumentalist
fell
silent
conceding
the
room
to
sangeeta
whirring
bells
she
seemed
at
the
last
to
be
treading
on
pure
air
her
feet
almost
invisible
when
the
intensity
of
her
rhythm
became
almost
unbearable
the
drummers
and
reentered
urging
the
excitement
to
a
crescendo
a
final
phrase
was
introduced
repeated
with
greater
intensity
and
then
a
third
and
final
time
ending
with
a
powerful
crash
on
the
large
drum
that
seemed
to
explode
the
tension
in
the
room
several
of
the
musicians
cried
out
involuntarily
almost
orgasmically
in
exultation
in
the
spellbound
silence
that
followed
the
nobles
around
hawksworth
burst
into
cheers
sangeeta
seemed
near
collapse
as
she
bowed
to
arangbar
the
moghul
smiled
broadly
withdrew
a
velvet
purse
of
coins
from
his
cloak
and
threw
it
at
her
feet
moments
later
several
others
in
the
room
followed
suit
with
a
second
bow
she
scooped
the
purses
from
the
carpet
and
vanished
through
the
curtains
the
cheers
followed
her
long
after
she
was
gone
what
do
you
think
ambassador
you
know
half
the
men
here
would
give
a
thousand
gold
have
her
tonight
nadir
sharif
beamed
mischievously
the
other
half
two
thousand
come
forward
arangbar
motioned
to
the
singer
sitting
on
the
carpet
he
was
hawksworth
now
realized
an
aging
portly
man
with
short
white
hair
and
a
painful
limp
as
he
approached
arangbar
dais
he
began
removing
the
tiny
cymbals
attached
to
the
fingers
of
one
hand
that
he
had
used
to
keep
time
for
the
dancer
he
her
guru
her
teacher
nadir
sharif
pointed
to
the
man
as
he
bowed
obsequiously
before
the
moghul
if
his
majesty
decides
to
select
sangeeta
to
dance
at
the
wedding
his
fortune
will
be
made
frankly
i
thought
she
was
good
though
there
is
still
a
trifle
too
much
flair
in
her
style
too
many
tricks
but
then
she
young
and
perhaps
it
too
soon
to
expect
genuine
maturity
still
i
noticed
his
majesty
was
taken
with
her
she
could
well
find
herself
in
the
soon
arangbar
flipped
another
purse
of
coins
to
the
man
and
then
spoke
to
him
curtly
in
persian
his
majesty
has
expressed
his
admiration
and
says
he
may
call
him
again
after
he
has
seen
the
other
dancers
nadir
sharif
winked
choosing
the
dancers
is
a
weighty
responsibility
naturally
his
majesty
will
want
to
carefully
review
all
the
women
the
lamps
brightened
again
and
servants
bustled
about
the
carpet
filling
glasses
and
exchanging
the
tobacco
chillum
clay
bowls
at
the
top
of
each
hookah
when
they
had
finished
arangbar
took
another
glass
of
wine
and
signaled
for
the
lamps
to
be
lowered
once
more
a
new
group
of
musicians
began
filing
into
the
room
carrying
instruments
hawksworth
had
never
before
seen
first
came
the
drummer
who
carried
not
the
two
short
tabla
drums
but
rather
a
single
long
instrument
designed
to
be
played
at
both
ends
simultaneously
a
singer
entered
next
already
wearing
small
gold
cymbals
on
each
hand
finally
a
third
man
entered
carrying
nothing
but
a
piece
of
bamboo
less
than
two
feet
in
length
and
perforated
with
a
line
of
holes
arangbar
looked
quizzically
at
nadir
sharif
as
though
reading
the
question
the
prime
minister
rose
and
spoke
in
turki
this
one
name
is
kamala
your
majesty
she
is
originally
from
the
south
but
now
she
is
famous
among
the
hindus
in
agra
although
i
have
never
seen
her
dance
i
assumed
your
majesty
would
want
to
humor
the
hindus
by
auditioning
her
we
are
a
sovereign
of
all
our
subjects
i
have
never
seen
this
hindu
dance
nor
these
instruments
of
the
south
what
are
they
called
the
drum
is
called
a
mirdanga
majesty
they
use
it
in
the
south
with
a
type
of
sitar
they
call
the
veena
the
other
instrument
is
a
bamboo
flute
arangbar
shifted
impatiently
tell
them
this
should
be
brief
nadir
sharif
spoke
quickly
to
the
musicians
in
a
language
few
in
the
room
seemed
to
understand
they
nodded
and
immediately
the
flautist
began
a
haunting
lyric
line
that
bathed
the
room
in
a
soft
echoing
melody
hawksworth
was
startled
that
so
simple
an
instrument
could
produce
such
rich
warm
tones
the
curtains
parted
and
a
tall
elaborately
jeweled
woman
swept
across
the
carpet
she
took
command
of
the
space
around
her
possessed
it
almost
as
though
it
were
part
of
her
being
her
long
silk
been
gathered
about
each
leg
so
that
it
seemed
like
trousers
and
her
every
step
was
announced
by
dense
bracelets
of
bells
at
her
ankles
most
striking
however
was
her
carriage
hawksworth
had
never
before
seen
such
dignity
of
motion
as
he
stared
at
her
he
realized
she
was
wearing
an
immense
encrusted
nose
ring
and
long
pendant
earrings
also
of
diamonds
not
even
the
moghul
wore
stones
to
equal
hers
her
face
was
heavily
painted
but
still
he
suspected
she
might
no
longer
be
in
the
first
bloom
of
youth
her
was
too
secure
she
knew
exactly
who
she
was
she
turned
her
back
to
arangbar
as
she
reverently
gave
an
invocation
both
hands
together
and
raised
above
her
head
to
some
absent
god
the
only
sound
was
the
slow
measured
cadence
of
the
drum
suddenly
it
seemed
as
though
her
body
had
captured
some
perfect
moment
of
balance
a
feeling
of
timelessness
within
time
hawksworth
glanced
toward
arangbar
whose
irritation
was
obvious
how
can
she
be
so
imprudent
as
to
ignore
him
are
hindus
afraid
of
him
what
was
her
name
kamala
his
eyes
shot
back
to
the
woman
kamala
can
she
be
the
woman
kali
spoke
of
that
last
night
in
surat
the
lotus
woman
nadir
sharif
said
she
was
famous
just
who
are
you
arangbar
voice
cut
through
the
carpeted
room
toward
the
woman
back
he
was
speaking
turki
and
he
was
outraged
kamala
whirled
on
him
one
who
dances
for
shiva
in
his
aspect
as
nataraj
the
god
of
the
dance
for
him
and
for
him
alone
what
do
you
call
this
dance
for
your
infidel
god
bharata
natyam
the
dance
of
the
temple
the
sacred
tradition
as
old
as
india
itself
the
god
shiva
set
the
world
in
motion
by
the
rhythms
of
his
dance
my
dance
is
a
prayer
to
shiva
kamala
eyes
snapped
with
hatred
i
dance
for
no
one
else
you
were
summoned
here
to
dance
for
me
arangbar
pulled
himself
drunkenly
erect
around
the
room
the
nobles
began
to
shift
uneasily
their
bleary
eyes
filling
with
alarm
then
i
will
not
dance
you
have
the
world
in
your
hands
but
you
can
not
possess
the
dance
of
shiva
our
dance
is
prescribed
in
the
natya
shastra
of
the
ancient
sage
bharata
over
a
thousand
years
ago
he
declared
that
dance
is
not
merely
for
pleasure
dance
is
the
blending
of
all
art
religion
philosophy
it
gives
mankind
wisdom
discipline
endurance
through
dance
we
are
allowed
to
know
the
totality
of
all
that
is
my
dance
is
not
for
your
sport
arangbar
anger
increased
but
now
it
was
leavened
with
puzzlement
if
you
will
not
dance
your
shiva
dance
then
dance
kathak
the
dance
muslims
call
kathak
is
the
perversion
of
yet
another
of
our
sacred
traditions
perhaps
there
are
some
hindu
dancers
who
will
for
muslim
gold
debase
the
ancient
kathak
dance
of
india
will
make
it
a
display
of
empty
technique
for
the
amusement
of
india
oppressors
muslims
and
she
turned
and
glared
at
hawksworth
now
but
i
will
not
do
it
the
kathak
you
want
to
see
is
no
longer
true
kathak
it
has
been
made
empty
without
meaning
i
will
never
debase
our
true
kathak
dance
for
you
as
others
have
done
any
more
than
i
will
dedicate
a
performance
of
bharata
natyam
to
a
mortal
man
the
guards
near
the
entrance
of
the
all
tensed
their
hands
dropping
uneasily
to
their
swords
i
have
heard
enough
a
man
who
dared
speak
to
me
as
you
have
would
be
sent
to
the
elephants
you
i
think
deserve
more
since
you
speak
to
your
god
through
dance
you
do
not
need
a
tongue
arangbar
turned
to
summon
the
waiting
guards
when
at
the
rear
of
the
the
figure
of
the
chief
painter
emerged
his
assistants
trailing
behind
they
carried
a
long
thin
board
nadir
sharif
spotted
them
and
immediately
leaped
to
his
feet
almost
as
though
he
had
been
expecting
their
entrance
your
majesty
he
quickly
moved
between
arangbar
and
kamala
who
stood
motionless
the
paintings
have
arrived
i
ready
for
my
horse
let
the
english
ambassador
see
them
now
arangbar
looked
up
in
confusion
his
eyes
half
closed
from
the
opium
then
he
saw
the
painters
and
remembered
bring
them
in
suddenly
his
alertness
seemed
to
return
i
want
to
see
five
inglish
kings
the
paintings
were
brought
to
the
foot
of
arangbar
dais
and
he
inspected
them
drunkenly
but
with
obvious
satisfaction
ambassador
inglish
have
a
look
arangbar
called
toward
the
hushed
shadows
of
the
seated
guests
a
path
immediately
cleared
among
the
bolsters
as
hookahs
were
pushed
aside
wineglasses
seized
hawksworth
walked
unsteadily
forward
his
mind
still
stunned
by
the
imminent
death
sentence
waiting
for
the
woman
as
he
passed
her
he
sensed
her
powerful
presence
and
inhaled
her
musky
perfume
there
was
no
hint
of
fear
in
her
eyes
as
she
stood
waiting
statuesque
and
defiant
by
the
time
he
reached
the
throne
eunuchs
were
waiting
with
candles
one
on
each
side
of
the
board
bathing
it
in
flickering
light
on
it
was
a
line
of
five
english
miniatures
of
king
james
each
approximately
an
inch
square
good
jesus
they
identical
am
i
so
drunk
i
ca
tell
a
painting
of
king
james
he
looked
up
shakily
at
arangbar
whose
smile
was
a
gloat
well
ambassador
inglish
what
say
you
are
the
painters
of
my
school
equal
to
any
your
king
has
one
moment
majesty
until
my
eyes
adjust
hawksworth
grasped
one
edge
of
the
board
to
steady
himself
behind
him
there
were
murmurs
of
delight
and
he
caught
the
word
as
he
walked
along
the
board
studying
each
painting
in
turn
he
suddenly
noticed
that
the
reflection
of
the
candlelight
was
different
for
one
the
paint
is
still
wet
on
the
new
portraits
that
the
difference
or
is
it
are
my
eyes
playing
tricks
damn
me
for
letting
nadir
sharif
fill
my
wineglass
every
chance
he
had
come
ambassador
inglish
we
do
not
have
all
night
arangbar
voice
was
brimming
with
triumph
hawksworth
studied
the
paintings
more
closely
yes
there
a
slight
difference
the
colors
on
the
one
painting
are
slightly
different
duller
they
did
use
varnish
and
there
are
fewer
shadows
theirs
are
more
i
astounded
your
majesty
but
i
believe
this
is
the
one
by
isaac
oliver
hawksworth
pointed
to
the
painting
second
from
the
right
end
let
me
see
them
again
arangbar
voice
was
a
husky
slur
i
will
tell
if
you
have
guessed
correctly
the
board
was
handed
up
arangbar
glanced
at
the
paintings
for
only
an
instant
you
have
guessed
right
ambassador
inglish
and
i
realize
how
you
did
it
the
light
from
the
candles
the
portraits
are
identical
your
majesty
i
confess
it
so
we
have
won
our
point
and
you
won
the
wager
inglish
still
you
won
only
because
of
my
haste
tomorrow
you
would
not
have
known
do
you
admit
it
i
do
your
majesty
hawksworth
bowed
slightly
so
you
did
not
really
win
the
wager
after
all
we
lost
it
but
i
am
a
man
of
honor
we
will
release
nadir
sharif
from
his
pledge
i
am
the
one
who
must
pay
what
would
you
have
perhaps
a
diamond
the
wager
was
only
for
a
horse
your
majesty
hawksworth
was
stunned
no
that
was
the
wager
of
nadir
sharif
you
have
won
a
wager
from
a
king
yours
must
be
the
payment
of
a
king
if
not
a
jewel
then
what
would
you
have
before
hawksworth
could
reply
nadir
sharif
stepped
forward
and
bent
toward
arangbar
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
suggest
your
majesty
the
a
woman
give
him
this
dancer
let
him
amuse
himself
with
her
until
you
can
find
a
suitable
wife
for
him
arangbar
looked
toward
hawksworth
with
glazed
eyes
it
was
obvious
he
had
already
forgotten
about
kamala
the
kathak
dancer
who
was
here
she
was
excellent
yes
that
would
be
perfect
your
majesty
of
course
means
the
woman
standing
here
now
nadir
sharif
directed
arangbar
groggy
gaze
toward
kamala
who
stood
mutely
eyes
flashing
there
she
is
of
course
what
do
you
say
to
her
inglish
hawksworth
was
astounded
by
nadir
sharifs
quickness
of
wit
he
saved
the
woman
he
a
genius
of
course
i
take
her
good
jesus
been
enough
bloodshed
today
the
woman
would
be
the
gift
of
a
great
prince
your
majesty
so
there
manhood
about
you
after
all
inglish
i
had
begun
to
think
you
were
like
your
king
arangbar
laughed
in
delight
so
it
a
woman
you
would
have
ambassador
merciful
allah
i
have
too
many
now
perhaps
you
would
like
two
i
recall
there
an
armenian
christian
somewhere
in
the
perhaps
several
they
said
to
be
as
lusty
as
the
portuguese
harlots
in
goa
he
choked
for
a
moment
on
laughter
let
me
summon
the
eunuchs
this
one
will
do
for
now
your
majesty
think
how
to
phrase
this
merely
to
serve
me
yes
she
will
you
ambassador
or
we
will
have
her
head
if
she
would
amuse
you
she
yours
kamala
look
met
hawksworth
it
was
strangely
without
emotion
then
arangbar
suddenly
remembered
kamala
defiance
and
turned
to
study
her
again
with
eyes
but
not
this
one
it
must
be
the
other
one
you
want
this
one
will
be
hanged
tonight
in
a
room
far
beneath
the
after
she
has
answered
for
her
words
tomorrow
her
carcass
will
pollute
the
jamuna
a
man
in
her
place
would
already
be
dead
may
it
please
your
majesty
it
would
satisfy
me
even
more
to
have
this
one
hawksworth
paused
perhaps
it
what
the
english
call
honor
we
both
know
i
did
not
win
our
wager
fairly
only
by
taking
something
of
no
value
like
this
woman
could
i
maintain
my
honor
and
my
king
you
are
persuasive
inglish
and
i
am
drunk
but
not
too
drunk
to
suspect
you
taken
a
fancy
to
this
infidel
but
if
you
prefer
her
to
the
other
then
so
be
it
we
offered
you
whatever
you
wished
yours
but
never
let
her
be
seen
on
the
streets
of
agra
again
we
will
have
her
cut
down
as
please
your
majesty
it
done
arangbar
turned
to
nadir
sharif
is
it
true
you
found
a
house
for
the
inglish
i
have
your
majesty
then
send
her
there
he
turned
to
hawksworth
allah
protect
you
from
these
infidel
hindus
inglish
they
have
none
of
your
inglish
honor
i
humbly
thank
your
majesty
jesus
christ
i
just
been
imprisoned
in
a
house
staffed
by
nadir
sharifs
spies
enough
we
been
told
to
retire
early
tonight
her
majesty
thinks
we
drink
to
excess
he
laughed
a
slurred
chortle
but
we
will
see
you
tomorrow
inglish
to
talk
more
we
have
much
to
discuss
we
want
to
hear
what
gifts
your
king
is
preparing
for
us
we
would
very
much
like
a
large
mastiff
from
europe
we
hear
they
hunt
game
like
a
arangbar
drew
himself
up
shakily
and
two
eunuchs
immediately
were
at
his
side
helping
him
from
the
white
marble
throne
none
of
the
guests
moved
until
he
had
passed
through
the
curtains
immediately
the
eunuchs
began
moving
about
the
room
extinguishing
the
lamps
by
the
time
the
guests
assembled
to
leave
the
room
was
virtually
dark
kamala
and
the
musicians
had
been
escorted
from
the
room
by
arangbar
guards
suddenly
hawksworth
felt
nadir
sharifs
hand
on
his
arm
that
was
a
noble
thing
you
did
ambassador
we
all
owe
you
a
debt
of
thanks
i
have
rarely
seen
his
majesty
so
out
of
temper
the
repercussions
could
have
been
distressing
for
many
of
us
it
was
your
idea
merely
a
quick
fancy
an
act
of
desperation
but
without
your
cooperation
it
would
have
been
impossible
i
do
thank
you
there
nothing
to
thank
me
for
hawksworth
drew
his
arm
away
where
this
house
you
found
for
me
nadir
sharif
sighed
finding
a
secure
lodging
these
days
is
more
difficult
than
you
might
first
imagine
ambassador
but
you
were
in
luck
i
remembered
there
a
small
lodge
in
my
palace
grounds
that
is
unoccupied
i
did
not
reckon
on
quarters
for
two
but
of
course
the
woman
will
be
living
with
your
servants
the
house
should
serve
until
something
more
fitting
can
be
found
my
thanks
damn
you
when
do
i
move
there
your
effects
have
already
been
moved
on
his
majesty
authority
you
can
come
tonight
my
men
will
show
you
there
your
dinner
is
probably
waiting
at
that
moment
the
last
lamp
was
extinguished
along
with
the
other
guests
they
groped
their
way
out
of
the
total
darkness
chapter
eighteen
many
years
ago
i
was
a
kamala
sat
pillowless
on
the
carpet
watching
as
hawksworth
ate
her
musicians
the
flautist
and
the
drummer
knelt
silently
behind
her
nadir
sharif
servants
stood
by
nervously
attentive
pretending
to
ignore
everyone
but
hawksworth
the
white
plaster
walls
of
the
room
fairly
flashed
with
kamala
diamonds
do
you
know
what
that
is
hawksworth
shook
his
head
his
mouth
gorged
with
roast
lamb
the
room
was
filled
with
its
aroma
it
was
his
first
lamb
since
burhanpur
and
he
was
ravenous
does
that
mean
yes
kamala
turki
was
surprisingly
good
hawksworth
suddenly
remembered
the
curious
indian
convention
of
swinging
the
head
from
side
to
side
to
signify
concurrence
he
had
meant
to
say
no
which
in
indian
body
language
was
an
almost
twist
of
the
neck
he
swallowed
the
lamb
and
reached
for
another
shank
no
i
meant
no
is
that
a
kind
of
dancer
it
means
servant
of
the
gods
in
south
india
there
a
special
caste
of
women
who
serve
in
the
great
stone
temples
who
are
married
to
the
god
of
the
temple
when
we
are
very
young
we
have
a
marriage
ceremony
like
any
wedding
except
we
are
a
bride
of
the
temple
and
then
we
serve
its
god
with
music
and
with
our
dance
hawksworth
examined
her
quizzically
you
mean
you
were
like
a
nun
what
is
that
they
something
like
papist
priests
women
who
give
themselves
to
god
or
at
least
to
the
pope
church
hawksworth
paused
awkwardly
and
claim
to
be
married
to
christ
so
they
never
lie
with
a
man
kamala
looked
at
him
with
surprise
not
even
the
men
who
come
to
the
temple
but
how
then
do
they
serve
this
christian
god
by
dance
only
nuns
are
known
to
do
much
dancing
they
mainly
well
i
really
know
what
they
do
except
claim
to
be
virgins
virgins
kamala
exploded
in
laughter
this
christian
god
must
be
a
eunuch
we
the
temple
with
our
bodies
not
with
empty
words
then
what
exactly
did
you
do
hawksworth
looked
up
and
examined
her
i
was
at
the
famous
shiva
temple
of
brihadishwari
in
tanjore
the
great
fountainhead
of
bharata
natyam
dance
in
india
there
we
danced
for
the
god
of
the
temple
and
we
danced
too
at
the
courts
of
the
dravidian
kings
of
the
south
she
hesitated
then
continued
devadasis
there
also
honor
the
temple
god
by
lying
with
men
of
high
caste
who
come
to
worship
and
by
wearing
the
jewels
they
give
us
all
part
of
our
sacred
tradition
she
laughed
as
she
watched
the
disbelief
flood
worth
face
i
gather
we
must
be
quite
different
from
your
christian
but
you
know
honored
in
the
south
many
are
granted
lands
by
the
men
they
know
and
though
they
can
never
marry
become
attached
to
a
man
and
bear
his
children
but
our
children
always
take
our
name
and
are
dedicated
to
the
temple
our
daughters
become
and
our
sons
temple
musicians
our
dance
gurus
are
part
of
a
hereditary
guild
and
they
are
esteemed
above
all
men
they
are
the
ones
who
preserve
and
pass
down
the
sacred
bharata
natyam
dance
you
may
not
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
we
are
highly
revered
by
the
kings
who
reign
in
the
south
lands
where
the
moghuls
fear
to
tread
they
know
we
are
special
among
women
we
are
cultivated
artists
and
among
the
few
hindu
women
in
india
who
teach
our
daughters
to
read
and
write
i
believe
you
hawksworth
studied
her
not
quite
sure
it
was
true
but
if
you
dedicated
to
a
temple
in
the
south
why
are
you
here
in
agra
kamala
dark
eyes
grew
lifeless
and
then
she
turned
away
i
no
longer
a
true
in
truth
i
have
not
danced
at
my
temple
for
many
years
the
first
time
the
moghul
army
invaded
the
south
a
rajput
officer
who
had
deserted
came
to
our
temple
to
hide
he
fell
in
love
with
me
and
forced
me
to
come
with
him
when
he
returned
to
agra
telling
me
i
must
dance
for
him
only
her
voice
hardened
but
i
never
danced
for
him
not
once
and
three
years
later
he
was
killed
in
a
campaign
in
bengal
since
that
time
i
have
had
to
live
by
my
own
hand
for
many
years
now
i
lived
by
teaching
dance
to
the
agra
who
muslim
dancing
girls
courtesans
who
live
in
beautiful
houses
here
and
entertain
men
there
are
many
in
agra
and
in
the
city
of
lucknow
to
the
east
kamala
tone
grew
vague
and
i
teach
them
other
things
as
well
but
why
did
you
insult
the
moghul
tonight
do
you
really
believe
all
the
things
you
said
what
i
said
was
not
a
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
by
that
things
either
are
or
they
are
not
what
does
it
matter
whether
we
them
but
what
i
did
was
foolish
i
agree
impulsive
i
so
despise
the
moghuls
you
know
i
told
the
moghul
prime
minister
this
afternoon
i
would
never
dance
for
arangbar
that
nothing
could
make
me
but
he
forced
me
to
come
anyway
hawksworth
eyes
narrowed
and
he
dropped
the
shank
of
lamb
he
was
holding
what
did
you
say
nadir
sharif
knew
all
along
you
would
refuse
to
dance
for
arangbar
of
course
he
knew
and
i
knew
arangbar
would
order
me
killed
why
i
wore
all
my
diamonds
i
thought
if
i
was
to
die
it
must
be
my
dharma
she
paused
and
you
know
it
strange
but
i
felt
nothing
except
perhaps
pity
for
my
pretty
little
courtesans
some
of
them
are
only
girls
and
i
wondered
who
would
teach
them
after
i
was
gone
hawksworth
was
no
longer
listening
he
was
trying
to
remember
the
exact
sequence
of
what
had
happened
in
the
he
arranged
it
the
bastard
even
the
paintings
nadir
sharif
played
with
me
like
a
puppet
just
so
he
could
send
her
here
he
knew
i
try
to
save
her
but
why
would
he
do
it
and
in
such
a
way
i
was
never
supposed
to
know
is
this
so
called
dancer
supposed
to
be
another
of
his
spies
you
said
you
worshipped
a
god
named
shiva
i
thought
hindus
worshiped
krishna
kamala
looked
at
him
with
surprise
you
know
of
krishna
yes
he
is
the
god
worshiped
by
the
rajputs
of
the
north
but
he
is
a
young
god
lord
shiva
is
the
ancient
god
of
south
india
he
presides
over
the
generation
of
life
his
lingam
symbolizes
the
male
half
of
the
force
that
created
the
universe
and
i
suppose
you
about
to
tell
me
that
the
part
of
him
you
worship
hawksworth
kept
a
straight
face
he
is
revered
in
many
aspects
including
nataraj
the
god
of
the
dance
but
yes
his
lingam
is
worshiped
have
you
seen
the
round
stone
pillars
wreathed
in
garlands
of
flowers
as
a
matter
of
fact
hawksworth
paused
then
looked
at
her
sharply
there
was
something
of
that
sort
in
the
porters
lodge
of
the
customs
house
at
surat
where
my
men
and
i
were
kept
the
morning
we
arrived
those
pillars
symbolize
shiva
lingam
let
me
tell
you
about
it
once
back
in
the
time
of
the
gods
lord
shiva
was
burdened
with
unhappiness
he
was
bereaved
of
his
consort
and
weary
with
his
being
and
he
wandered
into
a
forest
where
there
were
sages
and
their
wives
but
the
sages
scorned
lord
shiva
because
he
was
haggard
and
they
forsook
him
in
his
time
of
sadness
so
he
had
to
make
his
way
through
the
forest
begging
alms
however
the
women
of
these
sages
felt
love
for
him
and
they
left
the
beds
of
their
men
and
followed
him
when
the
sages
saw
their
wives
leaving
to
follow
shiva
they
set
a
curse
on
him
their
curse
was
that
his
lingam
would
fall
to
the
ground
then
one
day
shiva
did
shed
his
lingam
and
he
was
gone
only
his
lingam
remained
emerging
upright
from
the
earth
it
had
become
stone
and
it
was
of
infinite
length
all
the
other
gods
came
to
worship
it
and
told
mankind
to
do
likewise
they
said
that
if
it
was
worshiped
consort
the
goddess
parvati
would
come
to
receive
the
lingam
in
her
and
the
earth
would
be
made
fertile
and
even
now
we
worship
the
stone
lingam
set
erect
with
a
stone
its
base
we
honor
them
with
flowers
and
fire
and
incense
shiva
and
parvati
are
a
symbol
of
the
creation
of
life
she
looked
at
him
puzzling
christians
have
such
a
symbol
not
quite
like
that
one
hawksworth
suppressed
a
grin
i
guess
the
main
symbol
for
christians
is
the
cross
what
do
you
mean
christians
believe
the
son
of
the
christian
god
came
down
to
earth
and
sacrificed
himself
on
a
cross
so
the
cross
became
a
symbol
for
that
act
yes
i
seen
that
symbol
jesuits
wear
them
covered
with
jewels
but
i
never
knew
its
meaning
kamala
paused
seeming
to
ponder
the
idea
somehow
though
it
seems
very
static
surely
there
are
other
symbols
the
christians
have
symbols
more
dynamic
and
powerful
i
suppose
christians
think
it
pretty
powerful
but
do
christians
have
any
symbols
like
our
bronze
statues
of
the
dancing
shiva
lord
shiva
in
his
aspect
as
nataraj
the
god
of
the
dance
embodies
everything
in
the
world
that
what
you
said
to
arangbar
hawksworth
examined
her
and
tried
to
clear
his
mind
of
the
wine
but
i
do
understand
why
you
think
symbols
are
so
important
whatever
their
meaning
symbols
are
a
visible
sign
of
things
we
know
but
ca
actually
see
like
an
idea
kamala
voice
was
soft
and
warm
all
right
but
it
hard
to
imagine
how
one
symbol
could
contain
everything
no
matter
what
it
is
but
the
dancing
shiva
does
my
handsome
perhaps
you
have
not
seen
it
it
came
out
of
the
great
civilization
of
the
south
let
me
explain
it
for
you
and
then
perhaps
you
will
understand
why
dance
is
the
deepest
form
of
worship
kamala
rose
bells
tinkling
and
assumed
a
dance
posture
arms
outstretched
one
foot
raised
across
the
other
nadir
sharifs
muslim
servants
paused
to
stare
in
amazement
the
bronze
statues
of
dancing
shiva
have
four
arms
so
you
will
have
to
imagine
the
other
two
one
leg
is
crossed
over
the
other
and
raised
as
you
see
now
and
the
figure
stands
inside
a
great
circle
of
bronze
she
made
a
momentary
sweep
around
her
body
with
her
hands
on
this
circle
are
flame
tips
everywhere
pointing
outward
the
circle
signifies
the
world
as
we
know
it
the
world
of
time
and
of
things
and
the
flame
tips
are
the
limitless
energy
of
the
universe
lord
shiva
dances
within
this
great
circle
because
he
is
everywhere
in
fact
the
universe
itself
was
created
through
his
dance
and
our
world
here
is
merely
his
his
sport
you
mean
he
created
both
good
and
bad
christians
believe
there
evil
only
because
woman
tempted
man
into
sin
somewhere
along
the
way
sin
what
do
you
mean
by
that
kamala
stared
at
him
blankly
for
a
moment
whatever
it
is
shiva
created
it
his
dance
created
everything
in
nature
what
does
he
look
like
besides
having
four
arms
first
he
has
long
hair
which
represents
the
hair
of
the
yogi
the
contemplative
one
and
this
long
hair
streams
out
from
his
head
to
the
very
ends
of
the
universe
since
he
has
all
knowledge
and
each
of
his
four
arms
has
a
different
meaning
in
this
one
the
upper
right
arm
he
holds
a
small
drum
signifying
sound
music
and
words
the
first
thing
that
appeared
in
the
universe
and
in
his
left
hand
he
holds
a
burning
fire
his
symbol
of
destruction
he
creates
and
he
also
destroys
his
lower
right
hand
is
held
up
in
a
sign
she
held
up
her
hand
palm
out
as
though
in
a
blessing
this
is
a
part
of
the
hand
language
we
use
in
the
dance
and
it
means
not
it
is
his
benediction
of
peace
the
fourth
hand
points
down
toward
his
feet
one
foot
is
crushing
a
repugnant
powerful
dwarf
who
represents
man
willfulness
and
the
other
is
held
up
against
the
forces
of
the
earth
signifying
man
spiritual
freedom
kamala
paused
and
looked
at
hawksworth
hopefully
do
you
understand
do
you
see
how
the
dancing
shiva
symbolizes
everything
space
time
creation
destruction
and
also
hope
hawksworth
scratched
his
head
in
silent
confoundment
kamala
watched
him
then
sighed
and
resumed
her
seat
on
the
floor
then
just
try
to
feel
what
i
am
saying
words
really
can
not
express
these
ideas
as
well
as
dance
when
we
dance
we
invoke
the
energy
and
the
life
force
that
moves
through
the
world
outside
its
great
cycles
of
time
hawksworth
picked
up
his
wineglass
and
drew
on
it
to
tell
the
truth
i
find
your
hindu
symbols
a
trifle
abstract
but
they
not
really
they
merely
embody
truths
already
within
us
like
the
life
force
we
do
not
have
to
think
about
it
it
simply
there
and
we
can
reach
out
and
experience
this
force
when
woman
and
man
join
together
in
union
that
is
our
our
play
that
why
we
worship
lord
shiva
with
dance
and
with
as
hawksworth
watched
sipping
his
wine
and
scarcely
understanding
her
words
he
realized
he
had
begun
to
desire
this
bizarre
woman
intensely
you
have
told
me
what
that
because
i
not
sure
you
can
understand
she
scrutinized
him
professionally
how
old
are
you
i
closer
to
forty
than
thirty
time
i
think
has
treated
you
harshly
or
is
it
the
spirits
you
drink
what
wrong
with
a
bit
of
grog
now
and
then
i
think
you
should
not
drink
so
much
i
drink
nothing
look
at
me
she
pushed
back
the
hair
from
both
sides
of
her
forehead
her
face
was
flawless
you
know
most
muslims
despise
their
women
after
thirty
usually
before
but
many
young
officers
still
ask
to
visit
me
can
you
guess
how
old
i
am
a
woman
only
asks
that
if
she
thinks
she
looks
younger
than
she
is
i
over
fifty
she
examined
him
directly
invitingly
how
much
over
you
must
only
speculate
i
do
want
to
i
still
trying
to
figure
out
what
exactly
happened
tonight
he
studied
her
but
whatever
it
was
i
not
sure
i
care
anymore
hawksworth
shoved
aside
his
plates
of
lamb
and
rice
pilaf
and
watched
as
the
servants
began
hastily
clearing
the
carpet
in
the
quiet
that
followed
he
reached
behind
him
to
his
chest
opened
the
latch
and
took
out
his
lute
kamala
watched
with
curiosity
what
instrument
is
that
someone
in
surat
once
called
it
an
english
sitar
kamala
laughed
it
far
too
plain
for
that
but
it
does
have
a
simple
beauty
will
you
play
it
for
me
for
you
and
for
me
hawksworth
strummed
a
chord
the
white
plaster
walls
echoed
back
the
wave
of
notes
a
choir
of
thin
voices
it
brings
back
my
sea
legs
when
i
ashore
now
i
do
not
understand
you
but
i
will
listen
he
began
a
short
plaintive
galliard
suddenly
his
heart
was
in
london
with
honest
english
faces
clear
english
air
and
he
felt
an
overwhelming
ache
of
separation
he
played
through
to
the
end
then
wistfully
laid
the
lute
aside
after
a
moment
kamala
reached
for
his
wineglass
and
held
it
for
him
waiting
the
music
of
your
english
sitar
is
simple
young
ambassador
like
the
instrument
itself
but
i
think
it
moves
you
perhaps
i
felt
something
of
your
loneliness
in
the
notes
she
paused
and
studied
him
quietly
but
you
yourself
are
not
simple
nothing
about
you
comes
easily
i
sense
you
are
filled
with
something
you
can
not
express
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
longer
and
then
her
voice
came
again
soft
as
the
wine
why
did
you
say
what
you
did
to
arangbar
tonight
i
was
nothing
to
you
you
violated
my
perhaps
it
is
true
as
many
tell
me
that
i
have
mastered
the
arts
of
fully
than
any
woman
in
agra
but
still
there
is
less
and
less
pleasure
in
my
life
what
will
you
do
now
perhaps
you
think
i
belong
to
you
like
some
courtesan
you
have
bought
but
you
are
wrong
i
belong
to
no
man
you
here
because
someone
wanted
you
here
hawksworth
glanced
around
them
the
room
was
empty
now
save
for
kamala
two
musicians
i
do
know
why
but
i
do
know
you
the
first
person
i
met
in
a
long
time
who
was
not
afraid
of
arangbar
the
last
one
was
a
woman
in
surat
hawksworth
paused
suddenly
i
starting
to
wonder
if
you
know
her
i
do
know
anyone
in
surat
she
swept
him
with
her
eyes
but
what
does
some
woman
in
surat
have
to
do
with
me
perhaps
someone
thought
i
should
meet
you
who
someone
in
surat
but
why
perhaps
she
thought
i
needed
i
do
know
exactly
then
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
that
an
odd
phrase
a
perhaps
you
mean
our
meeting
is
part
of
your
you
mean
like
it
a
rajput
be
a
warrior
and
kill
can
be
many
things
it
what
each
of
us
must
do
our
purpose
that
something
i
heard
before
but
do
you
know
what
your
is
i
still
trying
to
find
it
maybe
it
to
be
here
and
then
what
i
i
guess
i
still
working
out
the
rest
well
for
hindus
there
a
second
aim
in
life
besides
our
honoring
our
dharma
we
call
it
that
aim
is
to
have
things
knowledge
wealth
friends
is
that
part
of
why
you
here
kamala
smiled
scornfully
some
merchants
seem
to
believe
their
primary
aim
it
ca
be
for
me
i
somehow
always
manage
to
lose
whatever
i
have
hindus
also
believe
there
a
third
aim
in
life
my
handsome
and
that
it
to
take
pleasure
in
the
senses
i
think
i
like
the
sound
of
that
better
than
the
other
two
do
not
speak
of
it
lightly
for
hindus
it
is
just
as
essential
as
the
other
two
aims
taught
by
lord
shiva
and
his
consort
parvati
it
means
love
pleasure
the
primal
force
of
desire
she
stared
at
hawksworth
for
a
long
moment
and
then
at
the
lute
standing
in
the
corner
music
is
part
of
it
one
way
we
experience
beauty
and
pleasure
that
the
the
heart
but
there
also
the
body
and
i
do
not
think
you
yet
know
it
your
music
betrays
you
you
are
a
man
of
sensuality
kamala
looked
at
him
regretfully
but
not
of
the
sensuous
do
you
even
understand
the
difference
how
do
you
know
what
i
am
remember
i
was
once
a
it
my
know
the
hearts
of
men
who
they
are
and
what
gives
them
pleasure
she
fell
silent
for
a
moment
then
continued
the
sensualist
is
one
who
only
knows
his
own
feelings
the
one
who
is
sensuous
knows
also
how
to
give
hawksworth
shifted
uncomfortably
uncertain
how
to
reply
do
you
ambassador
touch
a
woman
with
the
same
feeling
you
touch
the
strings
of
your
english
sitar
i
do
see
any
connection
the
arts
of
not
unlike
the
mastery
of
your
sitar
you
can
spend
a
lifetime
learning
to
sound
its
notes
but
you
do
not
create
music
unless
your
hand
is
in
touch
with
your
heart
with
the
breath
of
life
it
the
same
with
she
paused
discreetly
have
you
ever
known
it
with
a
woman
in
india
well
i
knew
a
courtesan
in
surat
who
kamala
eyes
hardened
but
her
voice
remained
dulcet
is
this
the
woman
you
spoke
of
no
this
was
a
different
woman
her
name
was
kali
and
she
was
thrown
out
of
arangbar
ah
she
was
probably
badly
trained
but
still
did
you
feel
the
force
of
with
this
surat
courtesan
hawksworth
shifted
again
uneasily
that
not
the
type
of
thing
we
normally
talk
about
in
england
do
be
foolish
you
judge
the
skill
of
a
musician
why
not
of
a
courtesan
she
turned
and
said
something
hawksworth
did
not
understand
both
musicians
immediately
rose
and
moved
a
screen
across
the
corner
of
the
room
where
they
were
sitting
then
from
behind
the
screen
came
the
first
notes
of
a
simple
poignant
melody
the
soft
tones
of
the
bamboo
swelling
slowly
to
envelop
the
room
in
their
gentleness
i
have
asked
him
to
play
the
the
opening
section
of
a
south
indian
raga
for
you
to
help
you
understand
his
music
has
the
life
breath
of
he
speaks
to
lord
shiva
with
his
music
too
must
come
from
the
heart
if
we
are
worthy
we
evoke
the
power
within
us
her
eyes
snapped
back
to
hawksworth
but
tell
me
more
about
this
surat
courtesan
perhaps
i
not
entirely
qualified
to
judge
she
certainly
knew
more
tricks
than
most
women
in
england
that
not
surprising
it
well
known
know
nothing
of
pleasure
kamala
paused
and
studied
hawksworth
carefully
with
her
dark
eyes
but
i
never
known
a
could
move
my
senses
with
music
you
did
that
just
now
even
though
i
do
understand
how
i
can
not
dance
for
you
that
is
for
shiva
but
i
want
to
touch
you
she
shifted
on
the
carpet
until
she
was
at
hawksworth
feet
with
a
gentle
motion
she
removed
a
boot
and
quickly
ran
a
finger
across
one
toe
nerves
throughout
his
body
tingled
unexpectedly
what
did
you
do
just
then
the
secret
of
touch
to
touch
and
be
touched
by
one
we
desire
always
gives
pleasure
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
is
that
a
very
small
part
you
know
the
courtesan
in
surat
actually
told
me
about
you
she
said
you
had
a
book
an
ancient
text
kamala
laughed
and
began
to
remove
the
other
boot
and
i
always
heard
that
everything
can
be
put
in
books
you
probably
mean
the
whoever
told
you
about
it
has
probably
never
seen
it
of
course
i
have
it
and
i
can
tell
you
it
is
one
of
the
great
frauds
of
india
it
was
compiled
by
a
musty
scholar
named
vatsyayana
who
obviously
knew
nothing
about
giving
pleasure
and
simply
copied
things
here
and
there
from
much
older
books
amusing
perhaps
but
it
also
pedantic
and
ignorant
it
certainly
not
sensuous
and
the
reason
is
he
knew
nothing
about
desire
he
probably
had
none
he
only
knew
how
to
make
lists
of
things
like
ways
of
biting
and
scratching
during
love
play
but
he
had
no
idea
why
these
are
exciting
she
stroked
the
other
foot
very
lightly
along
the
arch
with
her
long
red
fingernail
and
again
a
bolt
of
sensation
shot
through
him
i
beginning
to
see
your
point
i
do
think
you
understand
anything
yet
did
you
know
the
pleasure
the
power
the
beauty
possible
in
your
music
on
the
very
first
day
you
touched
a
string
of
this
instrument
i
knew
there
was
something
in
music
that
moved
me
but
i
was
sure
what
it
was
and
now
many
years
later
you
know
she
shifted
next
to
him
and
began
unfastening
the
bells
on
her
ankles
they
chimed
gently
as
she
carefully
laid
them
aside
then
she
opened
a
small
silver
box
she
had
brought
and
placed
a
red
dot
in
the
middle
of
her
forehead
just
below
the
pendant
jewel
i
sense
the
first
stirrings
of
me
now
the
awakening
of
desire
and
because
i
feel
it
i
know
you
must
feel
it
too
she
loosened
his
doublet
and
pushed
him
gently
against
the
bolster
the
notes
of
the
flute
wound
through
the
dark
air
around
them
kamala
listened
a
moment
in
silence
then
slowly
rose
off
the
bolster
she
stood
before
him
holding
his
gaze
with
her
eyes
and
pulled
away
the
heavy
jeweled
belt
at
the
waist
of
her
dance
sari
she
dropped
it
at
his
feet
never
averting
her
eyes
then
she
made
a
half
turn
and
twisted
her
hip
gracefully
into
a
voluptuous
bulge
the
silk
clung
even
tighter
to
the
statuesque
curve
of
her
legs
as
she
crossed
her
feet
with
an
almost
ceremonial
deliberation
wordlessly
she
slowly
drew
the
silk
end
of
the
across
her
shoulder
and
let
it
drop
before
her
revealing
the
curve
of
a
perfectly
spherical
breast
seen
from
behind
her
body
was
fixed
in
a
perfect
double
curve
a
sensuous
s
whose
top
was
the
full
line
of
her
breast
and
whose
bottom
was
the
rounded
edge
of
her
hip
in
those
few
simple
motions
she
had
transmuted
her
body
as
though
through
some
deep
cultural
memory
into
an
ancient
fertility
totem
a
prayer
for
the
bounty
of
the
human
loins
it
was
hawksworth
suddenly
realized
a
pose
identical
to
that
of
a
statue
he
seen
in
a
mossy
temple
in
mandu
on
the
way
north
from
burhanpur
it
was
the
essence
of
the
female
principle
sharing
with
the
earth
itself
the
power
of
life
that
stone
goddess
had
automatically
stirred
his
desire
as
it
had
the
desire
of
man
thousands
of
years
before
as
it
was
meant
to
do
now
it
stood
before
him
before
he
could
move
she
turned
again
and
swept
up
the
pleats
of
silk
that
comprised
the
front
of
her
she
whipped
the
loose
ends
of
silk
about
her
head
once
twice
and
magically
it
seemed
to
evaporate
from
her
body
all
that
remained
was
a
small
drape
of
silk
about
her
waist
held
in
place
by
a
thin
band
of
jade
her
body
was
like
ivory
perfect
from
the
band
at
her
neck
to
the
small
rings
on
her
toes
and
her
breasts
billowed
full
and
geometrically
round
a
long
necklace
of
pearls
nestled
between
them
as
hawksworth
stared
at
her
dumbfounded
the
drummer
commenced
a
finely
metered
rhythm
timed
exactly
with
his
heartbeat
she
moved
to
hawksworth
side
and
slid
her
left
hand
beneath
his
open
doublet
the
very
first
note
of
a
raga
can
contain
everything
if
it
is
sounded
with
and
the
first
touch
between
a
man
and
a
woman
can
become
the
om
the
syllable
that
carries
the
totality
of
creation
her
hand
glided
over
his
body
with
the
gentleness
of
a
feather
and
in
moments
his
ambassador
ensemble
slipped
away
like
some
superfluous
ancient
skin
he
looked
at
her
again
still
overwhelmed
by
her
physical
perfection
and
reached
to
touch
the
curve
of
her
breast
her
hand
stopped
his
in
midair
shiva
in
his
dance
had
four
hands
but
he
did
not
use
them
for
touch
do
you
want
to
feel
the
touch
of
my
breasts
then
feel
them
with
your
body
she
guided
him
over
across
the
round
bolster
then
rose
above
him
your
body
is
hard
and
firm
like
the
stone
lingam
of
shiva
but
your
skin
still
has
a
hidden
softness
like
a
covering
of
raw
silk
he
felt
the
hard
touch
of
her
nipple
as
it
began
to
trace
the
crease
of
his
back
it
moved
slowly
tantalizingly
trailing
just
at
the
skin
now
the
musk
of
her
perfume
had
begun
to
hover
about
his
head
fogging
his
mind
even
more
but
the
sensation
of
her
touch
and
the
knowledge
it
was
the
breast
he
wanted
exquisitely
to
hold
attuned
his
starved
senses
to
everything
around
him
even
the
quiet
rhythm
of
her
breath
suddenly
without
warning
she
slid
the
tip
of
her
long
red
fingernail
sharply
down
the
same
crease
in
his
back
where
his
nerves
strained
for
sensation
he
felt
a
delicious
burst
of
pain
and
whirled
to
meet
her
smiling
eyes
what
do
you
see
now
how
your
sense
of
touch
can
be
awakened
now
you
may
touch
my
breasts
but
only
with
the
nails
of
your
fingers
here
she
drew
him
to
his
feet
and
twined
one
leg
about
his
body
her
heel
in
the
small
of
his
back
enveloping
him
with
her
warmth
as
though
it
were
a
cloak
then
she
embraced
him
with
her
thighs
and
took
his
hands
in
her
own
forcing
a
pattern
of
scratches
on
each
of
her
breasts
with
his
nails
each
was
different
and
each
time
she
pressed
his
hand
she
named
the
shape
of
the
mark
her
breathing
grew
increasingly
rapid
from
the
pain
and
soon
both
her
breasts
were
decorated
with
a
garland
of
hard
red
lines
at
last
hawksworth
tried
to
speak
but
she
seized
his
lower
lip
between
her
teeth
while
her
nails
quickly
imprinted
a
pattern
of
identical
scratches
across
his
own
chest
he
found
the
pain
oddly
exhilarating
it
seemed
to
flow
between
their
bodies
attuning
them
deeply
one
to
the
other
instinctively
he
moved
to
take
her
but
she
twined
herself
even
tighter
about
him
unattainable
then
when
he
thought
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
she
lowered
herself
easily
against
the
bolster
he
scarcely
noticed
as
the
pace
of
the
drum
intensified
remember
you
can
not
touch
with
your
hands
anything
else
is
allowed
the
wine
had
saturated
his
mind
but
now
he
found
the
pleasure
of
desiring
of
her
body
overwhelming
he
moved
across
her
lightly
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
first
tasting
her
lips
then
her
dark
nipples
then
the
arch
beneath
her
arms
there
her
skin
was
soft
as
a
child
and
so
sensitive
he
caused
her
to
shudder
involuntarily
he
teased
her
slowly
languorously
until
she
erupted
with
cries
of
pleasure
then
he
moved
his
tongue
slowly
down
her
body
trailing
the
circle
of
the
navel
lightly
to
find
the
few
light
wisps
of
down
she
had
failed
to
banish
these
he
teased
lightly
with
his
breath
until
he
sensed
she
could
endure
it
no
longer
then
he
traced
his
sex
along
the
inside
of
her
thighs
upward
to
the
fringe
of
her
silk
wrap
until
at
last
they
were
both
lost
in
desire
with
a
quick
motion
she
rose
and
drew
astride
his
body
still
scarcely
touching
him
the
silk
at
her
waist
came
away
in
her
hands
and
without
a
sound
she
twined
it
into
a
moist
rope
kneeling
above
him
now
she
drew
it
slowly
across
the
tips
of
her
own
nipples
then
across
his
then
she
pulled
the
binding
of
jewels
from
her
hair
and
with
a
toss
of
her
head
spread
the
dark
strands
across
his
chest
as
he
watched
she
seized
the
ends
of
her
hair
and
began
to
draw
them
slowly
expertly
against
the
sensitive
underside
of
the
phallus
that
stood
beneath
her
her
breath
came
in
short
bursts
as
she
drew
close
enough
to
tease
her
own
sex
as
well
he
knew
he
had
lost
when
he
felt
his
last
attempts
at
restraint
dissolve
then
her
breath
told
him
she
had
lost
as
well
with
their
eyes
joined
each
exquisitely
aware
of
the
other
imminent
resolution
she
quickly
slipped
her
left
hand
beneath
her
and
caught
the
uppermost
tip
of
the
phallus
with
her
nails
holding
it
taut
the
pain
intensifying
his
pleasure
she
had
directed
the
pulse
at
the
point
of
her
own
ecstasy
guiding
the
warm
seed
exactly
as
she
wanted
against
her
own
hard
bud
as
it
struck
her
she
gave
the
of
release
and
with
a
hard
shudder
fell
across
him
loin
against
loin
exquisitely
replete
as
the
drummer
pounded
the
final
the
raga
hawksworth
realized
she
used
his
resolution
to
bring
her
own
without
their
bodies
touching
the
room
lay
silent
about
them
as
though
enfolded
in
their
content
only
their
hard
breath
remained
i
never
knew
lovemaking
could
be
so
intense
he
startled
himself
by
his
own
admission
because
i
loved
you
with
more
than
just
with
my
body
she
smiled
at
him
carefully
and
reached
out
to
touch
the
marks
on
his
chest
but
that
was
merely
the
first
stage
of
are
you
ready
now
for
the
second
chapter
nineteen
nadir
sharif
studied
the
pigeon
as
it
glided
onto
the
red
sandstone
ledge
and
rustled
its
feathers
in
exhausted
satisfaction
it
cocked
its
head
for
a
moment
as
it
examined
the
prime
minister
then
waddled
contentedly
toward
the
water
cup
waiting
just
inside
the
carved
stone
pigeon
house
he
immediately
recognized
it
as
one
of
the
birds
he
kept
stationed
in
gwalior
his
last

the

the

to
its

its

of
goa
miguel
vaijantes
nadir
sharif
waited
patiently
for
the
pigeon
to
drink
he
knew
well
the
rewards
of
patience
he
had
waited
patiently
studying
the
for
a
full
week
and
he
had
learned
almost
all
he
needed
to
know
the
englishman
had
been
invited
to
durbar
every
day
since
his
arrival
arangbar
was
diverted
by
his
stories
and
bemused
by
his
rustic
gifts
the
only
gift
that
had
not
entertained
arangbar
was
the
book
of
maps
he
had
wheedled
out
of
the
englishman
which
upon
inspection
showed
india
as
something
far
less
than
the
greatest
continent
on
the
globe
but
arangbar
found
the
map
rendering
of
india
coastline
to
be
sufficiently
naive
to
cast
the
accuracy
of
the
entire
book
into
question
this
was
the
first
had
ever
met
who
could
speak
turkish
and
understand
his
native
turki
and
the
moghul
rejoiced
in
being
able
to
snub
the
jesuits
and
dispense
with
their
services
as
translators
but
most
of
all
arangbar
loved
to
challenge
the
englishman
to
drinking
bouts
as
night
after
night
they
matched
cups
in
the
near
midnight
as
arangbar
and
the
englishman
drew
closer
the
jesuits
had
grown
distraught
to
near
madness
the
englishman
bragged
of
the
east
india
company
and
its
bold
plans
for
trade
of
the
old
levant
company
and
its
disputes
with
spain
over
mediterranean
routes
of
english
privateering
in
the
west
indies
of
everything
except
when
the
next
voyage
would
come
nadir
sharif
had
listened
closely
to
their
expansive
talk
all
those
nights
and
he
had
finally
deciphered
to
his
own
satisfaction
the
answer
to
the
question
uppermost
in
arangbar
mind
the
englishman
is
bluffing
england
has
no
fleet
at
least
no
fleet
that
can
ever
hope
to
threaten
portuguese
control
of
the
indian
ocean
there
be
no
more
voyages
and
no
more
presents
for
at
least
a
year
the
englishman
is
living
a
fool
dream
when
his
european
presents
are
gone
and
he
spent
what
left
of
his
money
buying
jewels
and
gifts
for
the
moghul
he
be
dropped
from
court
arangbar
plays
him
like
a
puppet
always
hinting
the
be
ready
tomorrow
but
there
be
no
arangbar
can
be
convinced
the
english
king
is
powerful
enough
to
protect
indian
shipping
from
portuguese
reprisals
at
sea
and
this
the
english
clearly
can
not
do
at
least
not
now
not
without
a
fleet
the
englishman
is
living
on
borrowed
time
and
i
beginning
to
think
he
suspects
it
himself
he
drinks
more
than
a
man
in
his
place
should
he
always
able
to
stay
in
control
but
just
barely
if
arangbar
were
not
always
drunk
himself
he
would
have
noticed
it
also
nadir
sharif
glanced
at
the
silver
cylinder
and
smiled
to
himself
so
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
is
worried
undoubtedly
demanding
i
contain
the
englishman
isolate
him
from
arangbar
it
will
hardly
be
necessary
the
englishman
is
destined
to
be
forgotten
soon
how
much
longer
can
he
hold
the
moghul
attention
a
month
two
months
i
know
his
supply
of
trifles
for
arangbar
is
already
half
depleted
but
why
burden
the
viceroy
with
this
insight
bargain
with
him
let
him
pay
enough
and
i
will
guarantee
with
my
life
that
the
sun
will
rise
tomorrow
morning
the
end
of
the
englishman
is
no
less
sure
nadir
sharif
stroked
the
pigeon
lovingly
as
he
began
to
unwind
the
silk
binding
holding
the
cylinder
and
it
reminded
him
again
of
the
deccan
still
no
pigeons
from
mumtaz
how
curious
that
her
one
dispatch
in
the
last
month
the
one
brought
by
the
rajput
was
merely
to
request
that
small
accommodation
for
the
englishman
who
knows
why
she
asked
it
perhaps
it
was
a
joke
of
the
prince
nadir
sharif
congratulated
himself
on
how
easy
it
had
been
the
englishman
had
never
known
and
it
was
obvious
the
woman
kamala
him
smoothed
him
was
the
prince
grooming
him
for
something
if
so
why
send
the
request
through
mumtaz
whatever
the
reason
it
had
been
a
pleasure
to
grant
this
one
favor
for
the
daughter
he
doted
on
he
also
realized
it
might
well
be
the
last
favor
he
could
ever
do
for
her
it
was
clear
now
that
prince
jadar
would
be
banished
from
agra
forever
the
events
of
the
next
four
weeks
were
inexorable
today
arangbar
birthday
celebrations
begin
next
week
allaudin
will
be
guest
of
honor
at
a
a
royal
hunt
two
weeks
after
that
the
wedding
formalities
begin
and
the
following
week
is
the
wedding
itself
four
weeks
and
jadar
will
be
finished
even
if
he
returned
to
agra
today
he
could
not
forestall
the
inevitable
nadir
sharif
took
the
pigeon
on
his
wrist
and
offered
it
a
few
grains
of
soaked
from
his
own
hand
as
he
gently
slipped
off
the
silver
cylinder
when
the
bird
was
pecking
contentedly
he
eased
it
onto
the
ledge
twisted
away
the
silver
cap
of
the
cylinder
and
settled
against
the
rooftop
divan
to
translate
the
cipher
the
morning
wind
from
the
jamuna
grew
suddenly
chill
against
his
skin
then
as
the
message
slowly
emerged
the
wind
from
the
jamuna
became
ice
nadir
sharif
translated
the
cipher
again
to
be
sure
but
there
could
be
no
mistaking
what
it
said
or
what
it
meant
he
would
have
declared
its
contents
an
absurd
hoax
perhaps
even
a
hoax
inspired
by
the
englishman
had
not
the
message
been
intercepted
by
the
portuguese
by
capture
of
one
of
jadar
own
pigeons
the
cipher
did
not
say
so
but
doubtless
a
copy
had
also
been
sent
to
arangbar
even
had
it
not
the
moghul
still
would
hear
the
news
within
the
day
his
own
intelligence
network
was
the
best
in
india
after
that
of
the
queen
he
closed
the
door
of
the
pigeon
house
picked
up
a
small
silver
bell
beside
the
divan
and
rang
lightly
almost
before
he
had
replaced
the
bell
a
eunuch
was
waiting
your
pleasure
sharif
sahib
the
englishman
where
is
he
now
in
the
garden
sharif
sahib
he
always
there
at
this
time
of
day
with
the
hindu
woman
what
he
doing
there
who
can
say
sharif
sahib
all
we
know
is
he
goes
into
the
garden
every
day
around
noon
i
think
the
hindu
woman
may
be
teaching
him
to
play
the
sitar
there
before
going
to
the
red
fort
but
he
will
be
leaving
soon
now
as
you
must
to
be
present
for
his
birthday
weighings
the
english
invited
nadir
sharif
was
momentarily
startled
he
received
an
invitation
sharif
sahib
bring
him
to
the
reception
room
i
will
see
him
now
before
he
leaves
the
eunuch
snapped
around
and
was
gone
nadir
sharif
paused
to
translate
the
cipher
one
last
time
before
ringing
for
his
turban
ambassador
hawksworth
please
forgive
my
preoccupation
these
past
few
days
nadir
sharif
was
bowing
it
seemed
unusually
low
we
not
always
privileged
to
entertain
our
guests
as
we
might
wish
preparations
for
today
birthday
ceremonies
have
kept
me
rushing
about
the
palace
but
please
be
seated
hawksworth
gaze
swept
the
room
it
was
cavernous
hung
with
thick
tapestries
on
every
wall
and
lightly
perfumed
with
rose
incense
before
he
could
reply
a
bowing
servant
was
proffering
a
chalice
of
persian
wine
as
nadir
sharif
watched
a
glass
being
poured
his
voice
continued
silken
have
you
found
anything
here
to
pass
the
time
they
tell
me
developed
an
interest
in
the
sitar
a
marvelous
instrument
really
and
in
my
garden
tell
me
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
ca
decide
hawksworth
felt
his
caution
rising
automatically
as
it
did
any
time
he
found
himself
alone
with
nadir
sharif
it
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
tudor
gardens
connected
with
english
castles
but
still
it
different
i
like
the
precise
geometry
of
the
walkways
and
hedges
and
the
running
water
it
a
soothing
place
to
sit
and
practice
so
you
find
the
persian
garden
soothing
it
is
persian
you
know
the
whole
idea
of
a
symmetrical
garden
comes
from
persia
not
from
this
barbarous
wasteland
nadir
sharif
motioned
him
to
a
bolster
and
paused
until
he
was
seated
yes
it
soothing
i
agree
with
you
but
of
course
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
a
garden
nadir
sharif
eased
himself
against
a
bolster
and
accepted
a
glass
of
it
pleases
me
that
you
enjoy
my
garden
you
see
ambassador
to
a
man
in
the
desert
an
oasis
a
spot
of
water
and
green
is
like
a
paradise
so
we
sometimes
believe
we
are
creating
a
bit
of
allah
paradise
when
we
create
a
garden
you
know
the
holy
quran
itself
tells
us
that
paradise
will
be
something
like
a
garden
but
whose
idea
was
it
to
build
persian
gardens
here
when
the
first
moghul
conqueror
arrived
in
india
almost
a
century
ago
he
declared
the
land
here
around
agra
to
be
particularly
barren
and
depressing
so
he
immediately
built
a
persian
garden
but
we
must
all
do
our
share
so
today
there
are
many
gardens
all
over
india
the
garden
you
see
is
our
tribute
to
nature
but
why
so
geometrical
your
garden
uses
water
stones
and
plants
to
create
designs
that
seem
almost
like
the
marble
floors
of
your
palace
mathematics
ambassador
principles
of
law
islam
is
the
rule
of
law
why
do
you
think
we
have
so
many
mathematicians
i
deliberately
designed
this
garden
with
calculated
geometric
divisions
it
provides
me
great
satisfaction
to
impose
order
on
the
willfulness
of
nature
but
why
are
the
stone
pathways
all
elevated
above
the
level
of
the
garden
in
english
gardens
they
at
ground
level
and
lined
with
shrubs
but
surely
that
obvious
as
well
our
gardens
are
really
concealed
waterways
with
water
constantly
flowing
from
one
end
to
the
other
we
must
put
the
walkways
above
the
water
nadir
sharif
waved
his
hand
but
all
of
that
is
merely
mechanics
the
garden
is
where
we
find
peace
it
where
we
wait
to
greet
the
spring
whose
arrival
we
celebrate
at
the
persian
new
year
nadir
sharif
strolled
to
a
window
and
looked
out
on
the
garden
spring
in
india
seems
to
come
up
from
the
south
it
said
that
buds
appear
each
day
a
few
north
like
a
tender
army
on
the
march
but
we
persians
believe
that
spring
must
have
a
haven
if
she
is
to
stay
and
that
another
reason
we
build
gardens
i
do
understand
there
a
famous
poem
in
persian
by
the
poet
farrukhi
about
gardens
and
spring
he
once
wrote
of
a
place
where
spring
always
arrived
feeling
lowly
and
despised
because
there
was
no
land
for
her
save
desert
a
place
of
rocks
and
thistles
but
then
a
rich
man
actually
the
patron
of
farrukhi
whom
he
was
writing
to
flatter
built
a
garden
for
her
and
the
next
year
spring
came
forth
from
the
south
and
found
a
home
there
nadir
sharif
smiled
in
fact
the
poem
begins
by
comparing
spring
original
arrivals
to
that
of
a
bankrupt
who
appeared
with
no
carpet
no
livelihood
but
after
spring
discovered
the
garden
she
brought
from
the
south
turquoise
for
the
willows
rubies
for
the
rose
nadir
sharif
smiled
what
do
you
think
of
farrukhi
poem
ambassador
what
do
you
mean
curiosity
i
was
wondering
what
are
the
chances
that
spring
will
come
again
from
the
south
this
year
did
the
merely
come
to
see
if
the
garden
was
ready
was
the
first
arrival
of
spring
false
with
the
real
arrival
yet
to
come
hawksworth
studied
nadir
sharifs
face
i
do
understand
what
trying
to
say
but
i
would
like
to
know
if
you
spoken
to
his
majesty
about
the
please
believe
i
mention
it
daily
i
think
now
he
soon
agree
to
terms
then
there
nothing
yet
hawksworth
set
down
the
glass
of
wine
i
assumed
that
was
why
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
but
you
just
wanted
to
talk
about
persian
gardens
and
persian
poets
ambassador
i
not
a
man
for
idle
talk
surely
we
know
each
other
better
than
that
nadir
sharif
turned
and
banished
the
servants
and
eunuchs
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
tell
me
i
know
you
met
prince
jadar
once
give
me
your
honest
opinion
do
you
think
he
a
clever
man
hawksworth
nodded
noncommittally
i
can
assure
you
ambassador
that
he
very
clever
indeed
even
his
staunchest
detractors
would
agree
on
that
and
he
also
resourceful
not
many
here
are
aware
he
has
a
full
intelligence
network
of
his
own
he
does
not
of
course
have
access
to
the
dispatches
of
the
official
court
reporters
in
the
provinces
the
or
the
dispatches
of
his
majesty
confidential
reporters
the
nadir
sharif
paused
at
least
we
do
not
think
he
has
access
to
their
reports
but
in
a
way
he
does
really
need
them
you
see
he
has
his
own
system
of
reporters
which
we
know
he
began
creating
over
two
years
ago
spies
whose
identity
is
carefully
guarded
we
do
not
know
any
of
their
names
but
we
do
know
he
calls
them
his
and
they
prepare
detailed
information
on
anything
in
the
provinces
he
asks
them
to
his
network
is
extensive
and
i
understand
quite
effective
hawksworth
suddenly
found
himself
remembering
shirin
the
papers
in
the
observatory
and
wondering
naturally
he
has
agents
along
the
southern
coast
but
at
times
they
can
be
a
bit
too
careless
about
the
information
they
gather
for
example
a
cipher
intended
for
the
prince
sent
by
one
of
secret
in
cochin
on
the
far
southern
end
of
the
malabar
coast
was
just
intercepted
by
a
portuguese
shipping
agent
at
the
port
of
mangalore
down
the
coast
south
of
goa
the
message
was
of
great
interest
to
the
portuguese
and
they
saw
fit
to
forward
it
to
me
what
do
you
suppose
the
message
contained
hawksworth
pulled
himself
alert
i
have
no
idea
tell
me
ambassador
the
east
india
company
does
trade
on
java
am
i
correct
six
years
ago
the
company
established
a
factory
a
trading
station
at
bantam
the
main
port
on
the
island
was
there
a
voyage
to
bantam
this
year
the
was
bound
for
bantam
this
year
with
cargo
from
surat
ambassador
the
time
for
games
is
over
your
charade
has
made
things
very
difficult
for
those
of
us
who
would
try
to
help
you
nadir
sharif
studied
hawksworth
deliberately
almost
sadly
it
would
have
been
helpful
if
you
had
told
me
everything
sooner
it
embarrassing
that
i
must
receive
my
information
through
captured
intelligence
when
authorized
to
serve
as
your
agent
i
sure
it
will
not
surprise
you
that
the
portuguese
viceroy
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
is
most
disturbed
at
the
news
there
will
be
consequences
what
are
you
talking
about
the
cipher
for
jadar
you
could
have
told
me
sooner
of
your
plans
it
would
have
made
all
the
difference
nadir
sharif
stared
coldly
at
hawksworth
there
no
longer
any
need
to
pretend
you
know
the
fleet
was
sighted
off
the
malabar
coast
by
coastal
fishing
barks
only
three
days
ago
four
armed
frigates
showing
english
colors
with
a
course
north
by
northwest
which
means
they
will
stand
to
sea
and
avoid
the
portuguese
patrols
along
the
coast
it
was
only
by
the
slightest
chance
that
they
were
seen
and
then
another
accident
that
the
cipher
intended
for
jadar
was
intercepted
otherwise
no
one
would
have
known
it
was
very
resourceful
of
your
east
india
company
ambassador
to
have
a
second
fleet
sail
up
our
west
coast
from
the
english
factory
at
java
unless
the
portuguese
had
intercepted
and
decoded
jadar
cipher
they
would
have
been
taken
completely
by
surprise
now
they
estimate
the
english
fleet
is
scheduled
to
reach
surat
within
the
month
unless
they
are
met
and
engaged
which
they
most
assuredly
will
be
the
perfumed
air
of
midmorning
still
seemed
to
hover
above
the
inner
courtyard
of
arangbar
palace
as
hawksworth
approached
its
towering
wooden
gates
the
astonishing
news
of
the
english
fleet
had
sent
his
spirits
soaring
and
he
had
donned
his
finest
doublet
and
hose
for
the
occasion
as
scimitared
eunuchs
scrutinized
his
gilded
invitation
and
bowed
obsequiously
for
him
to
pass
he
suddenly
felt
he
was
walking
through
the
portals
of
a
persian
dreamland
for
the
past
two
months
servants
and
slaves
had
toiled
through
the
crisp
autumn
nights
transforming
the
courtyard
of
the
red
fort
inner
palace
from
an
marble
arcade
into
a
vast
magnificent
reception
room
for
arangbar
lunar
birthday
fete
the
surrounding
galleries
had
been
softened
with
rich
carpets
their
walls
cloaked
in
new
tapestries
and
in
the
central
square
a
flowering
garden
freshened
by
interlocking
marble
fountains
had
appeared
out
of
nothing
in
this
new
garden
time
had
ceased
to
flow
night
and
day
knew
not
their
passage
one
into
the
other
for
the
sky
itself
was
now
a
vast
canopy
of
imperial
red
velvet
embroidered
in
gold
and
held
aloft
by
poles
forty
feet
high
and
the
size
of
ship
masts
the
horizons
of
this
velvet
sky
were
secured
to
protruding
stone
eyelets
along
the
galleries
by
multicolored
cotton
cords
the
thickness
of
cable
the
centerpiece
of
the
upcoming
celebration
was
an
enormous
balance
the
scale
on
which
arangbar
yearly
weight
would
be
taken
by
that
weight
his
physicians
would
foretell
the
future
estate
of
his
body
and
if
his
weight
had
increased
since
the
previous
year
there
was
universal
rejoicing
but
greater
or
less
his
weight
always
seemed
to
augur
well
for
india
his
physicians
inevitably
found
it
reason
to
forecast
another
hundred
years
of
his
benevolent
rule
nor
was
the
balance
itself
suggestive
of
anything
less
than
a
portentous
occasion
the
measure
of
a
king
demanded
kingly
measures
its
weighing
pans
were
two
cushioned
platforms
gilded
and
inlaid
with
jewels
suspended
from
each
end
of
a
central
beam
by
heavy
gold
chains
interwoven
with
silken
cords
the
beam
itself
and
its
supports
were
carved
from
rosewood
inlaid
with
jewels
and
plated
with
gold
leaf
this
event
of
universal
joy
was
never
witnessed
by
more
than
a
few
of
arangbar
closest
circle
the
first
tier
of
court
officials
were
permitted
in
watch
family
members
favored
officers
with
rank
over
five
thousand
horse
and
a
minuscule
list
of
select
foreign
ambassadors
hawksworth
tried
to
look
formal
and
attentive
but
his
mind
was
still
reeling
from
the
news
all
the
way
to
the
red
fort
he
had
tried
to
sort
out
the
implications
that
crafty
bastard
spencer
he
well
deserves
to
be
director
of
the
east
india
company
it
perfect
he
timed
it
perfectly
why
did
he
decide
to
send
a
second
voyage
did
they
accidentally
rendezvous
with
the
at
bantam
or
was
it
no
accident
could
elkington
have
ordered
them
north
or
maybe
it
some
sort
of
scheme
with
the
hollanders
who
could
the
be
spencer
you
deceiving
whoremaster
you
elkington
never
told
him
about
the
letter
from
king
james
and
now
you
or
somebody
has
me
or
saved
the
mission
there
sure
to
be
a
bounty
of
gifts
for
arangbar
if
they
can
make
it
around
goa
and
avoid
the
portugals
ambassador
this
way
nadir
sharif
was
standing
near
the
balance
motioning
him
to
the
front
ambassador
his
majesty
is
overjoyed
at
the
news
of
the
english
fleet
he
has
asked
that
i
seat
you
here
next
to
me
so
i
may
translate
the
persian
for
you
and
allow
you
to
prepare
a
full
report
to
your
king
the
prime
minister
had
changed
to
formal
dress
with
a
tapestried
turban
and
cloak
under
which
were
pants
he
wore
a
necklace
of
enormous
pearls
and
in
the
sash
at
his
waist
was
a
with
emeralds
he
was
barefoot
this
is
an
ancient
yearly
custom
of
all
the
great
moghuls
hawksworth
quickly
unbuckled
his
shoes
and
tossed
them
by
the
edge
of
the
vast
carpet
near
the
arcade
seat
yourself
here
next
to
me
and
i
will
explain
everything
to
you
his
majesty
thinks
the
news
of
your
trading
fleet
is
extremely
auspicious
coming
as
it
did
on
the
first
day
of
his
birthday
celebration
he
wants
to
return
the
honor
by
allowing
you
to
join
him
in
the
royal
circle
at
the
wedding
of
prince
allaudin
and
princess
layla
that
very
gracious
of
his
majesty
and
when
do
you
think
planning
to
sign
firman
english
trade
your
be
little
more
than
a
formality
now
ambassador
he
has
already
accepted
in
principle
the
terms
you
requested
but
you
must
realize
he
is
quite
preoccupied
i
think
you
will
have
what
you
want
in
a
few
more
weeks
his
majesty
has
assumed
a
natural
fondness
for
you
but
i
still
foresee
various
encumbrances
from
our
friends
in
goa
much
depends
on
the
fleet
and
what
happens
if
the
portuguese
intercept
it
nadir
sharif
moved
closer
and
lowered
his
voice
you
know
ambassador
the
appearance
of
your
fleet
bring
nearer
the
time
we
should
work
more
closely
together
someday
soon
perhaps
we
can
discuss
the
price
of
english
wool
i
have
five
northern
gujarat
that
produce
superb
indigo
they
are
convenient
to
the
port
of
cambay
just
a
few
of
surat
and
as
it
happens
i
have
a
private
understanding
with
the
shahbandar
of
cambay
it
may
be
possible
to
make
arrangements
that
would
help
us
both
avoid
some
of
the
normal
customs
duties
i
suggest
we
explore
it
hawksworth
looked
at
him
and
smiled
i
trade
with
you
the
day
after
hell
turns
to
ice
you
unscrupulous
son
of
a
whore
kettledrums
sounded
at
the
back
of
the
square
and
hawksworth
turned
to
see
arangbar
making
his
entry
followed
by
allaudin
and
a
the
men
around
hawksworth
bounded
to
their
feet
as
one
performed
the
and
then
settled
again
on
the
carpets
on
nadir
sharifs
whispered
urgings
hawksworth
also
rose
and
bowed
without
the
causing
nadir
sharif
eyes
to
flash
momentary
disapproval
as
they
both
resumed
their
seats
the
moghul
was
outfitted
in
the
most
magnificent
attire
hawksworth
had
ever
seen
he
seemed
to
be
clothed
in
a
fabric
of
jewels
diamonds
rubies
pearls
were
woven
into
his
cloak
and
his
sword
handle
appeared
to
consist
entirely
of
emeralds
his
fingers
were
covered
with
jeweled
rings
and
chains
from
which
dangled
rubies
his
chest
was
covered
with
sparkling
necklaces
and
even
his
turban
was
bejeweled
the
crowd
watched
with
anticipation
as
arangbar
strode
directly
to
the
nearest
platform
of
the
balance
and
tested
its
cushions
with
a
sparkling
hand
he
waited
with
a
broad
smile
while
it
was
lowered
to
the
carpet
then
without
a
word
seated
himself
onto
the
cushions
in
the
hunched
squat
all
indians
performed
allaudin
and
the
on
either
side
and
steadied
him
as
officials
from
the
mint
all
wearing
bright
red
turbans
approached
bearing
dark
brown
bags
bag
after
bag
was
piled
onto
the
opposite
platform
until
side
slowly
began
to
levitate
off
the
carpet
when
a
perfect
balance
had
been
achieved
his
side
was
tipped
gently
back
down
by
allaudin
and
the
while
the
officials
began
to
remove
and
count
the
bags
on
the
opposite
platform
when
the
bags
were
counted
the
weighing
commenced
again
this
time
with
bags
of
purple
silk
the
first
weighing
is
in
silver
rupees
nadir
sharif
whispered
through
the
reverential
silence
afterwards
they
are
taken
back
to
the
mint
and
distributed
to
the
poor
by
his
majesty
today
is
one
of
great
rejoicing
in
agra
how
much
does
he
weigh
his
usual
weight
is
about
nine
thousand
silver
rupees
that
over
a
thousand
pounds
in
english
sterling
is
that
a
large
amount
in
your
king
coinage
ambassador
it
a
substantial
sum
of
money
over
the
following
year
during
the
evenings
his
majesty
will
call
the
poor
of
agra
to
come
before
him
and
he
will
give
them
the
money
with
his
own
hand
how
far
will
nine
thousand
rupees
go
to
feed
all
the
poor
of
agra
i
do
understand
your
question
ambassador
nothing
i
i
was
just
wondering
if
perhaps
king
james
should
do
the
same
it
is
an
old
moghul
tradition
here
nadir
sharif
turned
back
to
the
scales
where
arangbar
was
calling
for
the
next
weighing
but
watch
now
he
will
be
weighed
against
gold
the
pile
of
bags
was
mounting
and
again
arangbar
platform
slowly
began
to
rise
into
the
air
there
are
twelve
weighings
in
all
you
will
see
after
the
gold
coins
he
is
weighed
against
gold
cloth
that
has
been
given
to
him
on
his
birthday
by
the
women
of
the
then
bags
of
jewels
that
were
contributed
by
the
governors
of
india
provinces
carpets
and
brocades
from
agra
nobles
and
so
forth
he
is
also
weighed
against
silk
linen
spices
and
even
ghee
and
grains
which
are
distributed
later
to
the
hindu
merchant
caste
arangbar
continued
to
smile
serenely
as
the
weighing
proceeded
during
the
weighing
of
silk
he
spotted
hawksworth
and
winked
raising
a
hand
to
flash
a
diamond
the
size
of
a
bullet
hawksworth
noted
wryly
that
he
had
not
seen
any
of
the
wealth
actually
being
distributed
that
it
was
all
in
fact
returned
directly
to
the
palace
when
all
the
weighings
were
completed
arangbar
drew
himself
erect
and
regally
moved
to
a
raised
platform
that
had
been
constructed
at
the
back
of
the
arcade
he
then
signaled
for
the
massive
balance
to
be
removed
and
in
moments
it
had
disappeared
into
the
recesses
of
the
palace
the
crowd
had
begun
to
shuffle
expectantly
as
hawksworth
watched
he
suddenly
realized
why
large
covered
baskets
were
being
brought
before
arangbar
and
when
their
lids
were
removed
hawksworth
caught
the
glisten
of
silver
arangbar
took
the
first
basket
and
stood
to
his
full
height
on
the
dais
then
with
a
swing
he
flung
the
contents
over
the
top
of
the
crowd
the
air
seemed
to
rain
silver
and
the
assembled
nobles
began
scrambling
over
the
carpet
retrieving
the
silver
objects
nadir
sharif
picked
up
one
and
handed
it
to
hawksworth
it
was
a
silver
nutmeg
and
topped
with
a
tiny
gold
flower
hawksworth
rolled
it
over
and
it
deflated
to
a
thin
piece
of
foil
arangbar
flung
another
basket
and
the
turmoil
intensified
only
hawksworth
stood
firm
as
even
nadir
sharif
could
not
resist
scooping
up
several
of
the
foil
replicas
of
nuts
fruits
and
spices
that
scattered
on
the
carpet
around
them
the
dignified
assemblage
had
been
reduced
to
bedlam
then
the
beaming
arangbar
spotted
hawksworth
and
called
out
ambassador
inglish
is
there
nothing
you
would
have
may
it
please
your
majesty
an
ambassador
of
the
english
king
does
not
scramble
for
toys
then
come
forward
and
you
not
have
to
when
hawksworth
reached
the
dais
he
bowed
lightly
and
as
he
drew
himself
up
arangbar
seized
the
front
of
his
doublet
and
dumped
a
basket
of
gold
foil
flowers
down
the
front
of
his
shirt
before
he
could
move
the
nobles
were
there
pulling
open
his
doublet
and
scooping
up
the
worked
foil
in
moments
his
doublet
was
plucked
clean
he
looked
about
in
disbelief
and
saw
that
arangbar
was
already
tossing
more
baskets
to
the
turbaned
crowd
when
the
silver
and
gold
were
gone
arangbar
spoke
quickly
to
the
eunuchs
and
trays
appeared
with
chalices
of
hard
spirits
the
assembled
nobles
all
toasted
the
moghul
health
and
he
joined
in
as
the
drinking
began
musicians
appeared
followed
by
food
on
plates
of
silver
worked
in
gold
finally
hookahs
were
set
about
the
carpet
together
with
more
drinks
and
a
singer
arrived
to
perform
an
afternoon
raga
this
is
an
auspicious
day
for
us
both
inglish
arangbar
beamed
down
from
his
throne
as
he
motioned
hawksworth
forward
the
news
just
reached
me
was
this
meant
to
be
a
surprise
the
english
fleet
is
my
king
birthday
gift
to
your
majesty
nothing
could
gratify
me
more
arangbar
drank
from
a
large
cup
of
wine
we
think
it
might
be
time
we
considered
sending
an
ambassador
of
our
own
to
the
court
of
your
inglish
king
we
just
sent
our
first
ambassador
to
goa
king
james
would
be
most
honored
your
majesty
tell
me
ambassador
inglish
when
will
these
ships
reach
the
port
at
surat
it
depends
on
whether
the
portugals
want
to
honor
the
treaty
between
spain
and
england
and
allow
our
fleet
to
pass
unchallenged
sailing
up
from
the
islands
will
mean
tacking
against
the
wind
but
the
fleet
could
possibly
make
landfall
within
a
month
hawksworth
paused
your
majesty
must
realize
this
adds
urgency
to
the
matter
of
the
trading
within
the
week
or
so
inglish
within
a
week
or
so
hawksworth
caught
a
slight
elevation
of
nadir
sharif
eyebrows
how
long
now
do
you
intend
to
be
staying
with
us
inglish
arangbar
popped
a
ball
of
opium
into
his
mouth
a
bit
too
early
in
the
day
hawksworth
thought
until
you
signed
the
trade
your
majesty
i
return
it
to
king
james
by
the
next
shipping
west
we
would
prefer
that
you
stayed
with
us
awhile
longer
inglish
no
one
regrets
more
than
i
that
it
not
possible
your
majesty
but
my
king
awaits
your
majesty
pleasure
regarding
the
terms
of
the
we
have
conceived
a
new
idea
inglish
we
will
send
the
ito
your
king
by
our
own
ambassador
then
you
can
remain
here
with
us
until
your
king
sends
another
ambassador
to
replace
you
arangbar
laughed
but
he
must
be
a
man
who
drinks
as
well
as
you
or
we
may
send
him
back
hawksworth
felt
his
stomach
tighten
who
can
say
when
another
ambassador
will
be
sent
your
majesty
should
your
majesty
approve
the
my
duties
here
will
be
but
you
must
remain
here
to
ensure
we
keep
our
word
inglish
arangbar
winked
broadly
else
our
heart
could
grow
fickle
i
am
honored
your
majesty
hawksworth
shifted
but
my
first
duty
is
to
my
king
we
have
been
thinking
perhaps
you
should
have
other
duties
arangbar
voice
trailed
off
as
he
sipped
on
his
wine
and
studied
hawksworth
then
he
looked
up
and
his
glance
fell
on
the
portuguese
jesuits
lingering
at
the
back
of
the
courtyard
as
he
examined
them
he
recalled
the
many
long
evenings
when
he
had
allowed
the
jesuit
pinheiro
and
his
superior
father
sarmento
to
debate
with
him
the
merits
of
christianity
and
again
he
found
himself
marveling
how
refreshingly
different
the
englishman
was
out
of
curiosity
he
had
once
inquired
of
the
jesuits
how
exactly
a
king
such
as
himself
could
become
a
christian
and
the
very
first
thing
they
had
said
was
he
must
select
only
one
of
all
his
wives
and
dismiss
the
rest
he
had
tried
to
point
out
to
them
the
absurdity
of
allowing
a
man
only
one
wife
without
even
the
option
to
rid
oneself
of
her
once
she
grew
tiresome
and
what
he
had
asked
was
this
king
to
do
if
his
single
remaining
wife
suddenly
became
blind
one
day
was
he
to
keep
her
still
of
course
they
had
replied
blindness
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
act
of
marriage
and
what
if
she
becomes
a
leper
patience
they
had
counseled
aided
by
god
grace
which
renders
all
things
easy
such
patience
he
had
pointed
out
might
be
customary
for
a
jesuit
who
had
abstained
from
women
all
his
life
but
what
about
one
who
had
not
and
they
had
replied
that
christians
also
were
sometimes
known
to
sin
but
that
the
grace
of
christ
provided
the
remedy
of
penitence
even
for
those
who
transgressed
against
the
law
of
chastity
he
had
listened
with
mounting
astonishment
as
they
next
proceeded
to
describe
how
jesuits
scourged
themselves
to
still
the
fires
of
the
flesh
at
this
last
he
had
realized
that
christian
doctrines
were
incomprehensible
and
unworthy
of
further
inquiry
from
that
time
forward
he
had
never
bothered
to
take
the
jesuits
seriously
but
this
englishman
is
different
he
told
himself
a
real
man
drink
a
cup
of
wine
or
eye
a
pretty
woman
with
plenty
of
unchaste
thoughts
on
his
sleeve
from
this
day
forth
you
be
serving
us
inglish
as
well
as
your
king
we
have
decided
to
make
you
a
hawksworth
stared
at
him
uncomprehending
a
murmur
swept
the
crowd
but
quickly
died
away
to
stunned
silence
a
your
majesty
is
a
title
given
to
officers
in
our
service
it
carries
with
it
great
honor
and
a
salary
no
ever
before
been
made
a
us
you
will
be
the
first
he
laughed
broadly
so
now
you
must
stay
in
india
and
drink
with
us
you
are
in
our
hire
i
flattered
by
your
majesty
generosity
hawksworth
found
himself
stunned
by
the
honor
and
also
by
the
disquieting
implications
for
his
planned
return
to
england
what
are
the
duties
of
a
first
inglish
we
must
have
a
ceremony
to
invest
you
properly
arangbar
seemed
to
ignore
the
looks
of
disbelief
on
the
faces
around
him
you
will
be
given
a
personal
honorary
rank
called
of
four
hundred
and
a
horse
rank
called
of
fifty
does
it
mean
i
have
to
maintain
that
many
cavalry
hawksworth
blanched
realizing
his
money
was
already
growing
short
if
you
do
you
will
be
the
first
india
who
ever
did
no
inglish
you
will
be
provided
salary
for
that
number
but
you
need
not
maintain
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
we
will
personally
select
them
for
you
after
the
wedding
arangbar
turned
and
motioned
to
nadir
sharif
the
prime
minister
came
forward
and
one
of
the
eunuchs
handed
him
a
small
box
of
teakwood
worked
in
gold
he
motioned
for
hawksworth
to
kneel
directly
in
front
of
arangbar
the
nobles
around
them
still
could
not
disguise
their
astonished
looks
nadir
sharif
moved
directly
above
where
hawksworth
was
kneeling
and
opened
the
box
his
majesty
by
this
symbol
initiates
you
into
discipleship
it
is
bestowed
only
on
the
very
few
he
took
out
a
small
gold
medal
attached
to
a
chain
and
slipped
the
chain
over
hawksworth
head
hawksworth
noted
that
the
medal
had
the
likeness
of
arangbar
imprinted
on
both
sides
now
you
must
prostrate
yourself
before
his
majesty
may
it
please
his
majesty
the
ambassador
of
a
king
must
show
his
gratitude
after
the
custom
of
his
own
country
hawksworth
replied
to
nadir
sharif
then
bowed
lightly
to
arangbar
i
humbly
thank
your
majesty
in
the
name
of
king
james
nadir
sharif
face
darkened
you
must
his
majesty
no
not
the
inglish
arangbar
waved
nadir
sharif
aside
he
must
follow
his
own
custom
now
give
him
the
pearl
nadir
sharif
took
a
large
pearl
from
the
box
and
stood
before
hawksworth
this
you
must
wear
in
your
left
ear
where
your
gold
earring
is
now
hawksworth
examined
the
pearl
it
was
immense
and
perfect
again
i
thank
your
majesty
hawksworth
looked
up
to
see
arangbar
beaming
how
shall
i
wear
it
my
jeweler
will
fit
it
for
you
inglish
a
wry
portly
man
stepped
forward
and
quickly
removed
the
small
gold
earring
from
hawksworth
ear
just
as
deftly
he
attached
the
pearl
where
it
had
been
and
now
inglish
i
will
bestow
on
you
the
highest
favor
of
my
court
he
turned
and
signaled
another
eunuch
to
come
forward
the
eunuch
carried
a
cloak
woven
with
gold
this
cloak
i
have
myself
worn
then
kept
aside
to
bestow
on
a
worthy
disciple
it
is
for
you
arangbar
took
the
cloak
himself
and
laid
it
over
shoulders
i
thank
your
majesty
the
honor
is
more
than
i
could
ever
merit
that
may
well
be
true
inglish
arangbar
roared
but
it
yours
you
speak
my
tongue
and
you
drink
almost
as
well
few
men
here
today
can
equal
you
and
you
have
the
wits
of
ten
portuguese
i
think
you
deserve
to
be
one
of
my
arangbar
signaled
for
him
to
rise
your
salary
will
begin
with
the
next
lunar
month
after
that
you
will
be
known
in
this
court
as
the
inglish
khan
day
after
tomorrow
you
will
ride
with
us
in
the
royal
hunt
you
may
soon
decide
you
like
india
better
than
england
have
you
ever
seen
a
tiger
never
your
majesty
you
will
soon
enough
day
after
tomorrow
so
you
had
best
do
your
drinking
now
for
tigers
require
a
clear
head
arangbar
laughed
again
and
clapped
and
the
tension
in
the
courtyard
semed
to
evaporate
the
singer
immediately
began
a
second
raga
as
hawksworth
fingered
the
earring
the
medal
and
the
cloak
he
found
himself
remembering
huyghen
burning
eyes
that
day
in
the
london
alehouse
you
forget
who
you
are
the
old
seaman
had
said
could
this
be
what
he
meant
but
maybe
it
not
so
bad
after
all
he
told
himself
it
like
a
dream
come
true
and
when
the
fleet
makes
landfall
of
course
i
heard
it
was
my
idea
although
his
majesty
naturally
assumes
he
thought
of
it
all
by
himself
making
the
confuse
the
portuguese
and
it
will
take
everyone
mind
off
the
a
while
queen
janahara
had
received
nadir
sharif
immediately
after
arangbar
retired
to
the
for
his
afternoon
dalliance
the
balcony
of
the
jasmine
tower
was
empty
the
servants
all
ordered
back
to
the
i
more
interested
in
the
english
fleet
do
you
know
what
has
happened
what
do
you
mean
majesty
nadir
sharif
noted
that
he
had
not
been
invited
to
sit
there
was
another
message
today
a
private
message
from
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
janahara
raised
a
silver
shaped
cuspidor
to
her
lips
and
delicately
discharged
red
betel
juice
can
you
guess
what
he
has
dared
to
do
what
do
you
mean
miguel
vaijantes
is
a
man
without
courage
the
understanding
was
very
clear
the
understanding
your
majesty
we
have
kept
our
side
of
the
agreement
there
has
been
no
the
english
but
now
his
excellency
has
declared
that
he
must
the
arms
he
has
begun
assembling
an
armada
to
sail
north
and
intercept
the
english
the
arms
your
majesty
nadir
sharif
moved
closer
miguel
vaijantes
was
shipping
arms
surely
you
knew
my
dear
brother
has
anything
ever
escaped
your
rapacious
eyes
she
smiled
then
spat
again
for
ahmadnagar
small
arms
and
cannon
you
were
arming
malik
ambar
against
jadar
nadir
sharif
could
not
strain
the
surprise
from
his
voice
we
were
not
arming
him
the
portuguese
were
miguel
vaijantes
was
to
have
armed
a
maratha
division
on
the
western
coast
at
a
portuguese
port
called
bom
bahia
on
the
coast
west
of
ahmadnagar
he
had
his
own
reasons
but
now
it
seems
he
has
lost
his
nerve
i
had
no
idea
how
alarmed
these
portuguese
were
by
the
english
nadir
sharifs
mind
was
reeling
say
something
anything
if
i
may
inject
a
word
on
his
excellency
behalf
majesty
you
must
understand
that
matters
between
the
portuguese
and
the
english
are
extremely
delicate
at
the
moment
nadir
sharif
voice
grew
more
statesmanlike
as
he
spoke
he
scarcely
heard
his
own
words
as
his
mind
plowed
through
the
consequences
of
it
all
and
the
treachery
the
english
could
conceivably
interrupt
the
entire
trade
of
the
portuguese
all
the
prince
could
ever
possibly
do
would
be
to
tighten
restrictions
on
our
ports
at
surat
and
cambay
the
viceroy
decision
is
clearly
strategic
nothing
more
i
sure
the
regard
he
holds
for
your
majesty
remains
undiminished
that
is
a
touching
consolation
janahara
voice
was
frigid
and
she
seemed
suddenly
much
older
footsteps
sounded
through
the
marble
corridor
and
allaudin
appeared
at
the
doorway
he
had
changed
to
a
foppish
green
turban
set
off
by
an
effeminate
necklace
of
rubies
his
elaborate
secured
by
a
sash
of
threaded
brocade
and
an
emerald
was
set
at
the
top
of
each
slipper
he
wore
heavy
perfume
your
majesty
he
salaamed
to
queen
janahara
and
then
stood
attentively
somewhat
sheepishly
until
she
gestured
for
him
to
sit
you
late
i
was
detained
in
my
quarters
majesty
janahara
seemed
completely
preoccupied
unable
even
to
look
at
the
prince
the
question
now
is
what
to
do
about
the
englishman
what
do
you
mean
allaudin
did
not
trouble
to
mask
his
sneer
perfectly
clear
his
majesty
adores
the
he
surely
sign
the
for
english
trade
then
there
be
a
war
on
the
seas
it
really
most
exciting
the
is
not
yet
signed
janahara
moved
to
the
balcony
and
studied
the
river
below
her
walk
was
purposeful
yet
still
the
perfection
of
elegance
nor
do
i
think
it
ever
will
be
his
majesty
will
not
have
the
time
the
wedding
will
be
moved
forward
before
his
highness
prince
jadar
has
the
leisure
to
trouble
us
more
janahara
turned
and
examined
the
two
men
one
her
brother
and
one
her
future
finding
herself
astonished
by
their
credulity
somehow
she
told
herself
the
hand
of
jadar
lies
behind
all
this
the
coincidence
was
just
too
great
first
he
had
succeeded
in
raising
troops
from
the
southern
and
now
the
deccanis
could
not
be
armed
could
he
possibly
still
forge
a
peace
in
the
deccan
still
after
the
wedding
he
would
be
isolated
then
what
he
did
would
no
longer
matter
but
if
the
signed
there
would
no
longer
be
leverage
with
the
portuguese
janahara
looked
directly
at
nadir
sharif
if
his
majesty
signs
the
the
wedding
you
will
be
held
responsible
i
understand
majesty
nadir
sharif
shifted
when
will
the
wedding
be
i
think
it
would
be
auspicious
to
hold
it
the
week
following
the
birthday
celebration
which
means
the
preparations
must
begin
now
hold
the
wedding
immediately
after
the
hunt
there
scarcely
time
there
will
be
time
for
that
and
more
janahara
turned
to
allaudin
and
you
would
do
well
to
start
spending
more
time
with
a
sword
and
bow
and
less
with
your
pretty
slave
girls
i
will
know
before
long
if
you
are
a
match
for
jadar
i
pray
to
allah
i
do
already
suspect
the
answer
chapter
twenty
there
on
that
hill
inglish
is
where
i
was
born
arangbar
pointed
to
the
high
sandstone
walls
of
a
distant
hilltop
fortress
outlined
against
the
midday
sky
it
called
fatehpur
sekri
it
was
a
great
city
during
the
time
of
my
father
akman
but
now
it
abandoned
it
romantic
but
it
also
forbidding
i
only
been
back
once
in
my
life
and
that
was
enough
hawksworth
elephant
was
half
a
length
behind
those
of
arangbar
and
allaudin
even
with
that
of
nadir
sharif
it
was
the
second
morning
of
their
ride
and
they
were
nearing
the
locale
of
the
royal
hunt
it
seemed
to
him
that
half
of
agra
had
traveled
along
the
queen
and
her
retinue
were
behind
them
as
were
many
of
arangbar
favorite
women
his
guard
his
eunuchs
the
entire
palace
staff
the
location
of
the
hunt
was
a
ride
from
agra
what
there
now
it
abandoned
inglish
except
for
a
few
sufi
muslims
they
were
there
before
and
i
guess
they
be
there
forever
what
do
you
mean
were
there
before
before
what
ah
inglish
we
had
a
very
romantic
birth
you
seem
to
know
nothing
of
it
you
see
my
father
the
great
akman
had
tried
for
many
years
to
have
a
son
before
i
was
born
many
hundreds
of
women
inglish
but
not
one
could
give
him
a
son
once
twin
boys
were
born
to
a
rajput
princess
he
had
wived
but
both
died
a
few
days
later
gradually
he
became
obsessed
with
fears
of
death
of
dying
without
a
lineage
and
he
began
calling
holy
men
to
the
evening
to
question
them
about
mortality
once
a
hindu
holy
man
came
who
told
akman
the
greatest
duty
of
a
king
is
to
leave
a
male
heir
who
can
carry
his
lineage
forward
the
great
akman
was
plunged
into
even
greater
sadness
by
this
and
he
to
renounce
everything
until
he
could
have
a
son
he
walked
all
the
way
from
agra
to
that
mountain
inglish
arangbar
pointed
toward
the
fortress
he
came
to
see
a
holy
sufi
living
there
among
the
rocks
and
wild
beasts
it
was
a
momentous
meeting
akman
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
holy
man
and
the
sufi
held
out
his
arms
in
welcome
to
the
great
moghul
of
india
in
later
years
many
of
akman
artists
painted
the
scene
akman
told
him
that
he
had
come
to
find
the
peace
of
allah
to
find
his
own
destiny
as
a
seeker
after
truth
the
sufi
offered
this
great
warrior
berries
to
eat
and
gave
him
his
own
simple
hut
for
an
abode
akman
stayed
for
many
days
meditating
with
the
sufi
and
finally
when
he
made
ready
to
leave
the
sufi
told
him
he
would
have
three
sons
and
now
arangbar
grinned
we
reach
the
interesting
part
when
next
a
wife
announced
she
was
with
child
akman
moved
her
out
here
to
stay
in
the
same
abode
as
the
holy
man
and
as
the
sufi
predicted
a
male
child
was
born
and
the
child
was
you
are
riding
beside
him
inglish
that
is
the
story
of
my
birth
akman
was
so
elated
that
he
decided
to
build
an
entire
city
here
and
move
the
capital
from
agra
he
built
the
city
but
it
was
an
obvious
act
of
excess
he
never
found
time
to
live
there
and
soon
it
was
abandoned
so
now
the
mountain
is
like
it
was
before
my
birth
home
to
wild
birds
and
a
few
mad
sufis
the
only
difference
is
they
have
a
magnificent
abandoned
city
to
live
in
instead
of
straw
huts
he
laughed
again
perhaps
i
owe
my
very
life
to
a
sufi
incidentally
descendants
of
that
holy
man
still
live
there
are
they
all
sufis
who
knows
inglish
i
think
holy
men
from
all
over
india
can
be
found
there
from
time
to
time
it
become
a
kind
of
retreat
i
like
permission
to
visit
it
sometime
majesty
of
course
inglish
you
find
it
magnificent
hawksworth
squinted
against
the
sun
and
studied
the
distant
red
walls
of
the
something
about
its
remote
purity
beckoned
him
after
the
hunt
he
told
himself
when
there
time
right
after
the
hunt
arangbar
fell
silent
and
hawksworth
leaned
back
in
his
it
rocked
gently
along
elephants
made
better
mounts
than
he
had
first
suspected
he
thought
again
of
the
previous
morning
and
his
first
reaction
when
told
he
would
be
riding
an
elephant
for
the
next
two
days
he
had
arrived
at
the
red
fort
to
be
greeted
by
nadir
sharif
who
directed
him
to
the
royal
elephants
being
readied
in
the
courtyard
of
the
his
majesty
has
selected
one
of
his
favorites
for
you
her
name
is
kumada
nadir
sharif
had
pointed
toward
a
large
female
elephant
her
body
dyed
black
and
festooned
with
golden
bells
tassels
gold
tusk
rings
what
does
the
name
mean
the
infidel
hindus
believe
the
eight
points
of
the
earth
are
each
guarded
by
a
heavenly
being
in
the
shape
of
an
elephant
your
english
fleet
is
coming
to
us
out
of
our
ocean
from
the
southwest
and
kumada
is
the
name
hindus
give
to
the
elephant
who
guards
that
point
of
the
hindu
compass
his
majesty
believes
this
elephant
will
be
auspicious
for
you
i
most
grateful
to
his
majesty
hawksworth
surveyed
the
assembled
crowd
in
astonishment
around
him
nobles
wearing
jeweled
turbans
and
silk
trousers
were
selecting
elephants
he
had
worn
sea
boots
and
a
leather
jerkin
nadir
sharif
signaled
toward
the
mahout
perched
atop
the
neck
of
kumada
and
the
man
tapped
her
flapping
ear
with
a
short
barbed
rod
and
gave
her
directions
in
hindi
as
he
guided
her
toward
hawksworth
she
lumbered
forward
to
where
hawksworth
stood
and
then
her
mountainous
flesh
seemed
to
roll
like
a
wave
as
she
kneeled
front
legs
out
back
legs
bent
at
the
knee
ready
to
be
mounted
two
keepers
were
there
opening
the
gate
of
the
then
kneeling
ready
to
hoist
the
aboard
have
you
ever
ridden
an
elephant
before
ambassador
nadir
sharif
monitored
hawksworth
apprehensive
expression
with
delight
never
i
never
actually
been
this
close
to
one
before
hawksworth
eyed
the
elephant
warily
mistrusting
her
seeming
docility
elizabethans
circulated
fabulous
tales
about
this
mountainous
beast
that
it
could
pull
down
great
trees
with
the
power
of
its
trunk
that
it
had
two
hearts
one
it
used
when
calm
the
other
when
incensed
and
that
in
ethiopia
there
were
dragons
who
killed
elephants
merely
to
drink
their
blood
said
to
be
ice
cold
at
all
times
you
will
find
an
elephant
has
more
wit
than
most
men
his
majesty
keeps
a
thousand
in
his
stables
here
in
the
red
fort
the
great
akman
used
to
trap
them
in
the
wild
using
a
female
in
heat
but
then
he
learned
to
induce
tame
ones
to
couple
your
elephant
i
believe
is
she
a
animal
kumada
examined
hawksworth
with
her
sad
dark
eyes
and
waved
her
fanlike
ears
skeptically
i
not
entirely
sure
she
taken
to
me
here
ambassador
nadir
sharif
slipped
a
stick
of
sugarcane
into
hawksworth
hand
and
nodded
his
head
toward
the
elephant
hawksworth
gingerly
approached
her
and
began
unwrapping
the
paper
no
sooner
was
the
cane
in
view
than
kumada
nipped
it
deftly
from
his
hand
with
a
flourish
of
her
trunk
she
popped
the
cane
into
her
mouth
and
flapped
her
ears
with
obvious
pleasure
as
she
cracked
it
with
her
immense
teeth
for
a
second
hawksworth
thought
he
caught
a
flash
of
appreciation
in
her
eyes
he
paused
a
moment
then
walked
close
enough
to
stroke
the
heavy
skin
at
her
neck
she
not
forget
you
now
ambassador
nadir
sharif
was
feeding
his
own
elephant
it
said
these
animals
have
a
memory
longer
than
a
man
hawksworth
vaulted
into
the
the
entire
world
suddenly
seemed
to
shudder
as
her
mahout
signaled
kumada
to
rise
he
seized
the
railing
surrounding
him
and
gasped
as
she
rumbled
to
her
feet
you
soon
ride
like
a
rajput
ambassador
the
elephant
rocked
into
motion
it
was
worse
than
heavy
weather
at
sea
i
think
it
may
take
practice
women
from
the
elephants
all
the
way
to
kashmir
in
the
summer
i
sure
you
manage
a
hunt
nadir
sharif
swung
easily
into
his
howdah
around
them
other
elephants
were
kneeling
for
nobles
to
mount
where
will
the
hunt
be
this
time
we
going
west
out
toward
the
old
city
of
fatehpur
sekri
but
his
majesty
has
hunting
preserves
all
over
in
the
neighborhood
of
agra
and
near
the
small
town
of
delhi
north
of
here
along
the
course
of
the
jamuna
and
reaching
into
the
mountains
there
is
much
uncultivated
land
there
are
many
places
with
grasses
over
six
feet
high
and
copse
wood
this
land
is
guarded
with
great
care
by
the
army
and
no
person
high
or
low
is
allowed
to
hunt
there
except
for
partridge
quail
and
hare
which
are
caught
with
nets
so
the
game
nilgai
deer
antelope
tiger
even
some
lions
is
plentiful
some
of
his
majesty
hunting
preserves
may
extend
as
far
as
ten
every
direction
i
believe
that
around
twenty
of
your
miles
you
said
preparations
for
the
hunt
had
been
underway
for
days
of
course
when
his
majesty
announces
a
a
royal
hunt
the
grand
master
of
the
hunt
in
that
particular
location
has
to
begin
extensive
preparations
the
hunts
now
are
usually
a
which
was
invented
by
akman
what
that
first
sentries
are
posted
on
all
the
roads
leading
into
the
preserve
to
keep
villagers
out
and
then
the
entire
preserve
is
surrounded
by
beaters
we
call
them
who
begin
to
close
the
circle
and
drive
in
the
game
for
this
week
hunt
he
used
thirty
thousand
the
grand
master
of
the
hunt
informs
his
majesty
when
the
game
has
been
brought
together
the
next
day
the
court
and
officers
from
the
army
leave
early
to
be
at
the
appointed
place
to
meet
his
majesty
when
he
arrives
his
majesty
usually
hunts
alone
at
first
if
there
are
no
tigers
and
everyone
else
must
wait
at
a
distance
of
about
one
only
some
members
of
the
imperial
army
are
allowed
to
accompany
him
for
protection
after
his
majesty
wearies
of
the
kill
then
others
of
his
choosing
are
allowed
to
kill
the
last
of
the
game
but
if
tigers
are
to
be
hunted
it
customary
that
only
his
majesty
and
the
royal
family
enter
the
circle
it
always
been
the
tradition
of
moghul
rulers
that
only
they
and
their
kinsmen
are
allowed
to
hunt
tigers
but
this
hunt
will
be
different
this
time
his
majesty
will
merely
watch
who
do
the
killing
then
that
my
surprise
you
ambassador
let
me
merely
say
that
it
is
no
man
you
will
see
hawksworth
was
still
wondering
what
he
meant
but
the
time
was
not
far
away
when
he
would
know
they
were
nearing
the
area
that
nadir
sharif
had
said
was
designated
for
the
hunt
inglish
arangbar
shouted
back
over
his
shoulder
does
your
king
hunt
rarely
your
majesty
but
he
has
no
elephants
perhaps
we
should
send
him
some
but
then
i
assume
he
has
no
tigers
either
should
we
also
send
him
some
tigers
to
run
free
in
ingland
so
he
can
hunt
them
i
remember
to
ask
his
majesty
but
first
you
must
see
our
tigers
for
yourself
inglish
today
you
and
nadir
sharif
will
join
us
as
we
go
into
the
the
hunting
round
have
your
elephants
fitted
with
leather
armor
nadir
sharif
started
with
surprise
i
thank
your
majesty
for
the
honor
allaudin
stirred
in
his
and
hawksworth
caught
the
disdain
in
his
eyes
majesty
why
are
you
inviting
the
the
her
majesty
suggested
it
and
it
amuses
me
arangbar
seemed
to
dismiss
allaudin
question
he
will
not
have
a
weapon
all
he
do
is
watch
as
servants
rushed
forward
to
begin
fitting
the
leather
armor
hawksworth
saw
the
queen
elephant
approach
this
was
the
closest
he
had
ever
been
to
her
and
still
he
could
not
see
her
her
completely
enclosed
with
curtains
which
now
flapped
lightly
in
the
midday
breeze
her
majesty
queen
janahara
will
be
going
into
the
hunting
circle
nadir
sharifs
voice
was
discreet
as
he
spoke
to
hawksworth
she
rarely
joins
in
but
she
is
an
excellent
shot
this
is
a
rare
honor
for
you
ambassador
hawksworth
studied
the
closed
howdah
and
wondered
why
the
honor
seemed
to
leave
him
with
such
an
uneasy
feeling
the
waiting
nobles
formed
a
line
with
their
elephants
as
the
imperial
entourage
moved
past
armed
guards
followed
on
horseback
at
a
distance
leather
padding
had
been
fitted
over
the
face
and
shanks
of
hawksworth
and
nadir
sharif
elephants
and
they
joined
the
end
of
the
procession
hawksworth
held
firmly
to
the
side
of
the
his
elephant
rocked
along
with
only
occasional
instructions
from
her
mahout
now
they
followed
a
winding
road
which
was
surrounded
on
either
side
by
tall
brown
grass
he
warily
studied
every
sway
of
the
grass
imagining
tigers
waiting
to
spring
why
do
we
have
guns
he
turned
to
nadir
sharif
who
rode
alongside
rocking
placidly
in
his
swaying
howdah
there
no
need
ambassador
i
told
you
the
tiger
will
not
be
killed
with
guns
today
of
course
his
majesty
and
prince
allaudin
have
guns
but
they
merely
for
protection
in
case
there
some
minor
difficulty
minor
difficulty
what
are
to
do
if
there
a
difficulty
the
army
will
be
there
men
with
he
smiled
easily
you
in
no
danger
ahead
the
woods
seemed
to
open
up
and
the
grass
was
shorter
perhaps
only
as
high
as
a
man
waist
deer
darted
wildly
from
side
to
side
contained
by
high
nets
that
had
been
erected
around
the
sides
of
the
clearing
as
they
approached
hawksworth
saw
a
long
line
of
several
hundred
water
buffalo
waiting
heavy
bovine
animals
with
thick
curved
horns
dipping
back
against
their
heads
each
fitted
with
a
leather
saddle
and
reined
by
a
rider
on
its
back
the
reins
which
passed
through
the
buffalo
nostrils
were
held
in
one
hand
by
a
mounted
soldier
whose
other
hand
grasped
a
naked
broadsword
those
men
may
well
be
the
bravest
soldiers
in
the
army
nadir
sharif
pointed
to
the
riders
who
were
all
saluting
arangbar
arrival
theirs
is
a
task
i
do
not
envy
what
do
they
do
you
will
see
for
yourself
ambassador
in
just
a
few
moments
from
beyond
the
other
side
of
the
clearing
as
though
on
an
agreed
signal
came
the
sound
of
beaters
as
the
imperial
elephants
drew
near
the
gray
line
of
buffalo
their
riders
began
to
urge
them
ahead
the
buffalo
snorted
knowing
what
waited
in
the
grass
and
then
they
lumbered
forward
tossing
their
heads
in
disquiet
the
line
of
buffalo
was
curved
in
the
shape
of
a
and
arangbar
urged
his
elephant
directly
behind
them
the
grass
ahead
swarmed
with
frightened
game
as
deer
and
antelope
dashed
against
the
nets
and
were
thrown
back
and
from
the
woods
beyond
the
clatter
and
shouts
of
the
beaters
increased
suddenly
from
out
of
the
grass
a
tawny
head
appeared
with
gold
and
black
stripes
and
heavy
whiskers
the
animal
dashed
for
the
side
of
the
enclosure
sprang
for
freedom
and
was
thrown
back
by
the
heavy
net
hawksworth
watched
it
speechless
unprepared
for
the
size
and
ferocity
of
an
indian
tiger
it
was
enormous
with
powerful
haunches
and
a
long
striped
tail
the
tiger
flipped
to
its
feet
and
turned
to
face
the
line
of
buffalo
with
an
angry
growl
arangbar
clapped
his
hands
with
delight
and
shouted
in
urdu
to
the
line
of
riders
all
hawksworth
now
realized
rajputs
the
buffalo
snorted
and
tried
to
turn
back
but
their
riders
whipped
them
forward
the
tiger
assumed
a
crouching
stalk
along
the
gray
horned
wall
eyeing
a
large
dark
buffalo
with
a
bearded
rider
then
it
sprang
the
buffalo
head
went
down
and
when
it
came
up
a
heavy
curved
horn
had
pierced
the
tiger
neck
there
was
a
snort
and
a
savage
toss
of
the
head
that
flung
the
wounded
tiger
upward
as
it
whirled
in
the
air
hawksworth
saw
a
deep
gash
across
its
throat
the
rajput
riders
nearby
slipped
to
the
ground
and
formed
a
wall
of
swords
between
arangbar
and
the
tiger
as
the
line
of
buffalo
closed
in
bellowing
for
the
kill
in
what
seemed
only
moments
the
tiger
was
horned
and
pawed
to
a
lifeless
pulp
superb
arangbar
shouted
something
to
the
enclosed
hawksworth
did
not
understand
a
hundred
gold
to
every
man
on
the
line
the
rajputs
remounted
their
buffalo
retrieving
the
reins
from
the
bloody
grass
and
the
line
again
moved
forward
this
is
a
variation
on
his
majesty
usual
tiger
hunt
nadir
sharif
shouted
through
the
dust
above
the
din
of
bellowing
buffalo
and
trumpeting
elephants
often
he
shoots
but
today
his
majesty
elected
merely
to
watch
actually
animal
fights
have
long
been
a
favorite
pastime
in
india
at
that
moment
a
pair
of
tigers
emerged
from
the
grass
and
stared
at
the
approaching
line
of
buffalo
they
did
not
seem
frightened
as
had
the
first
and
they
watched
the
line
coolly
as
though
selecting
a
strategy
then
they
dropped
into
a
crouching
stalk
moving
directly
toward
the
center
of
the
line
hawksworth
noticed
arangbar
suddenly
order
his
mahout
to
hold
back
his
elephant
the
other
imperial
elephants
had
also
paused
to
wait
then
arangbar
turned
and
ordered
the
servant
who
rode
behind
him
to
pass
forward
a
sporting
piece
allaudin
whose
fright
was
transparent
also
signaled
for
a
gun
hawksworth
mahout
pulled
his
elephant
directly
behind
arangbar
as
though
for
protection
the
tigers
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
engage
the
buffalo
they
scrutinized
the
approaching
line
and
waited
for
their
moment
then
when
the
buffalo
were
no
more
than
ten
feet
away
both
sprang
simultaneously
the
female
was
speared
on
the
horn
of
a
buffalo
but
she
flipped
in
midair
and
sank
her
teeth
into
the
leather
shielding
on
its
neck
as
its
rajput
rider
slipped
to
the
ground
the
male
of
the
pair
dashed
past
his
mate
and
sprang
for
him
the
rajput
swung
his
broadsword
catching
the
tiger
in
the
flank
but
it
swatted
him
aside
with
a
powerful
sweep
of
its
paw
and
he
crumpled
his
neck
shattered
other
rajputs
rushed
the
male
tiger
with
their
swords
as
their
buffalo
closed
in
to
kill
the
female
but
it
eluded
their
thrusts
as
it
circled
arangbar
elephant
soldiers
with
had
already
rushed
to
form
a
barricade
between
arangbar
elephant
and
the
tiger
but
the
moghul
seemed
unperturbed
while
the
panting
male
tiger
stalked
arangbar
the
female
tiger
was
forgotten
as
hawksworth
watched
spellbound
his
pulse
pounding
he
caught
a
yellow
flicker
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
turned
to
see
the
female
tiger
slip
past
the
ring
of
buffalo
and
dash
toward
the
rear
of
arangbar
elephant
it
was
on
the
opposite
side
from
the
armed
soldiers
where
the
moghul
elephant
was
undefended
hawksworth
opened
his
mouth
to
shout
just
as
the
female
tiger
sprang
for
arangbar
but
at
that
moment
a
shot
rang
out
from
the
enclosed
howdah
of
queen
janahara
and
the
female
tiger
crumpled
in
midair
curving
into
a
lifeless
ball
as
it
smashed
against
the
side
of
the
moghul
mount
the
jolt
caused
arangbar
shot
at
the
male
tiger
to
go
wide
merely
grazing
its
foreleg
a
dozen
pierced
its
side
as
it
stumbled
forward
and
it
whirled
to
slap
at
the
rajputs
allaudin
also
fired
his
tiger
gun
but
his
shot
missed
entirely
almost
hitting
one
of
the
men
trying
to
hold
the
tiger
back
it
whirled
in
a
bloody
circle
for
a
moment
and
then
stopped
it
was
staring
at
hawksworth
he
heard
his
mahout
shout
in
terror
as
the
tiger
sprang
for
the
head
of
their
elephant
a
wrap
of
yellow
fur
seemed
to
twist
itself
around
the
elephant
forehead
as
the
tiger
dug
its
claws
into
the
protective
leather
padding
as
kumada
tossed
her
head
in
panic
the
mahout
screamed
again
and
plunged
for
safety
rolling
through
a
clump
of
brown
grass
and
scrambling
toward
the
soldiers
the
tiger
caught
hawksworth
eyes
with
a
hypnotic
gaze
as
it
began
pulling
itself
over
the
forehead
of
the
terrified
elephant
directly
toward
his
howdah
kumada
had
begun
to
whirl
in
a
circle
and
shake
her
head
futilely
trying
to
dislodge
the
wounded
fury
slashing
at
her
leather
armor
the
tiger
slipped
momentarily
then
caught
its
claws
more
firmly
and
began
to
climb
again
almost
without
thinking
hawksworth
reached
forward
and
grabbed
the
the
short
pike
and
claw
used
for
guiding
an
elephant
that
the
mahout
had
left
lodged
in
a
leather
fold
behind
the
elephant
head
he
wrenched
it
free
and
began
to
tease
the
tiger
back
kumada
was
running
now
wildly
it
seemed
toward
a
large
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
but
the
tiger
had
pulled
itself
atop
her
head
and
as
hawksworth
jabbed
its
whiskered
face
with
the
he
heard
a
deep
growl
and
saw
a
flash
of
yellow
and
claw
as
a
sharp
pain
cut
through
his
shoulder
he
knew
he
was
falling
dizzily
hands
grasping
against
smooth
leather
as
he
slipped
past
the
neck
of
the
elephant
past
its
flapping
ear
against
a
thundering
foot
that
slammed
the
dust
next
to
his
face
kumada
had
suddenly
stopped
dead
still
throwing
him
sprawling
against
the
base
of
the
he
looked
up
to
see
the
tiger
suspended
above
him
glaring
down
clawing
at
the
face
of
the
elephant
and
bellowing
with
pain
then
he
heard
the
snap
of
the
tiger
spine
as
kumada
slammed
it
again
and
again
against
the
massive
trunk
of
the
tree
only
when
the
tiger
was
motionless
did
she
let
it
drop
carefully
tossing
its
body
away
from
hawksworth
as
it
tumbled
lifeless
onto
the
grass
hawksworth
looked
up
through
the
dust
to
see
arangbar
pulling
his
elephant
alongside
that
was
most
auspicious
inglish
it
an
ominous
and
evil
protent
for
the
state
if
a
tiger
i
have
shot
escapes
the
hunt
if
that
beast
had
succeeded
in
going
free
we
would
have
had
to
send
the
entire
army
into
the
countryside
to
find
and
kill
it
your
kumada
saved
me
the
trouble
the
gods
of
the
southwest
have
been
auspicious
for
our
reign
today
i
think
you
brought
us
luck
i
thank
your
majesty
hawksworth
found
himself
gasping
for
breath
no
it
is
you
we
must
thank
you
were
enough
to
keep
the
tiger
where
kumada
could
crush
it
arangbar
called
for
his
own
elephant
to
kneel
and
he
walked
briskly
to
kumada
who
was
still
quivering
from
fright
he
stroked
her
face
beneath
the
eye
and
she
gentled
perceptibly
it
was
obvious
she
loved
arangbar
magnificent
only
once
before
have
i
ever
seen
an
elephant
do
that
i
hereby
promote
her
immediately
to
first
rank
even
though
a
female
he
turned
to
nadir
sharif
have
it
recorded
as
hawksworth
tried
to
rise
he
felt
a
bolt
of
pain
through
the
shoulder
where
the
tiger
had
slapped
him
he
looked
to
see
his
leather
jerkin
shredded
arangbar
seemed
to
notice
it
too
and
he
turned
and
motioned
to
nadir
sharif
who
signaled
to
another
man
who
called
yet
another
moments
later
a
physician
was
bending
over
hawksworth
he
probed
the
skin
for
a
painful
moment
and
then
slammed
a
knee
against
hawksworth
side
giving
the
pained
arm
a
quick
twist
hawksworth
heard
himself
cry
out
from
the
pain
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
might
lose
consciousness
but
then
his
mind
began
to
clear
and
he
realized
he
could
move
the
arm
again
the
pain
was
already
starting
to
abate
i
suggest
the
shoulder
be
treated
with
compresses
for
a
few
days
majesty
nadir
sharif
had
dismounted
from
his
elephant
and
was
there
attentive
as
always
then
he
must
be
sent
back
to
agra
of
course
majesty
nadir
sharif
stepped
closer
to
arangbar
but
perhaps
it
would
be
equally
wise
to
let
the
somewhere
near
here
perhaps
at
the
old
city
he
turned
and
pointed
toward
the
west
there
at
fatehpur
i
think
there
may
still
be
a
few
sufi
hermits
there
who
could
attend
the
shoulder
until
over
then
he
could
return
with
us
arangbar
turned
and
shaded
his
eyes
as
he
stared
at
the
horizon
above
the
tree
line
could
be
seen
the
gate
of
the
fortress
at
fatehpur
sekri
but
my
shoulder
is
fine
now
hawksworth
tried
to
move
into
the
circle
of
conversation
there
no
need
very
reasonable
arangbar
seemed
to
ignore
hawksworth
as
he
turned
back
to
nadir
sharif
you
can
escort
the
inglish
to
the
fortress
call
up
a
palanquin
for
him
leave
your
elephant
here
and
take
a
horse
as
the
physician
bound
hawksworth
arm
in
readiness
a
palanquin
was
brought
from
among
the
women
elephants
a
contingent
of
rajputs
can
go
with
him
arangbar
shouted
instructions
to
the
captain
of
his
guard
and
watched
the
men
fall
into
formation
then
he
remounted
his
elephant
and
signaled
for
the
buffalo
to
resume
their
sweep
of
the
tall
grass
as
the
party
started
forward
hawksworth
saw
nadir
sharif
shout
orders
to
one
of
the
servants
attending
him
and
as
four
rajputs
lifted
hawksworth
palanquin
off
the
ground
a
servant
rushed
forward
to
shove
a
flask
inside
it
was
brandy
hawksworth
turned
to
see
nadir
sharif
grinning
a
gleam
in
his
eye
she
watched
the
palanquin
ease
up
the
weathered
winding
path
leading
to
the
fortress
gate
the
procession
had
moved
slowly
through
the
gate
at
the
northeast
corner
of
the
city
walls
and
now
the
rajputs
were
clustered
around
the
palanquin
and
the
lone
rider
the
night
was
still
awash
in
a
wild
desert
fragrance
and
the
moon
was
curing
slowly
from
white
to
a
rarified
gold
her
vantage
in
a
corner
turret
of
the
wall
was
and
perfect
she
examined
the
rider
and
smiled
when
she
recognized
the
face
nadir
sharif
you
have
kept
your
part
of
the
bargain
all
of
it
as
she
studied
him
through
the
half
light
she
wondered
why
they
were
coming
a
day
earlier
than
planned
then
the
palanquin
stopped
and
the
other
figure
emerged
she
hesitated
before
looking
at
last
forcing
herself
willing
her
eyes
to
see
after
a
long
moment
she
turned
to
the
tall
man
standing
next
to
her
his
beard
was
white
as
were
his
robes
his
eyes
saw
what
she
saw
but
he
did
not
smile
he
turned
to
her
and
nodded
wordlessly
then
he
tightened
his
white
robe
and
moved
easily
down
the
stone
staircase
toward
the
courtyard
below
hawksworth
had
sensed
the
autumn
light
begin
to
fall
rapidly
as
they
approached
the
gates
of
the
already
there
was
a
pale
moon
promising
fullness
in
size
and
grandeur
the
portals
of
the
gate
reminded
hawksworth
of
the
red
fort
in
agra
only
the
walls
themselves
were
considerably
less
formidable
the
palace
itself
sat
atop
a
wooded
hill
and
already
the
stones
of
the
abandoned
roadway
leading
up
the
hill
were
becoming
overgrown
there
was
a
small
village
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
where
smoke
from
evening
cooking
fires
had
begun
to
rise
but
from
the
fortress
itself
there
was
no
smoke
no
hint
of
life
or
habitation
he
alighted
from
the
palanquin
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
stairway
leading
to
the
palace
gate
and
together
with
nadir
sharif
passed
slowly
up
the
abandoned
steps
the
rajputs
trailed
behind
them
as
they
reached
the
top
and
passed
under
the
shadow
of
a
arch
that
framed
the
gateway
the
dark
surrounded
them
like
an
envelope
and
the
rajput
guards
pushed
forward
toward
the
black
outline
of
two
massive
wooden
doors
at
the
back
of
the
recess
they
pushed
open
the
doors
and
before
them
lay
a
vast
open
courtyard
empty
in
the
moonlight
is
this
place
completely
abandoned
i
still
do
understand
why
here
nadir
sharif
smiled
on
the
contrary
ambassador
it
far
from
abandoned
but
it
appears
so
does
it
not
then
hawksworth
saw
a
figure
approaching
them
gliding
noiselessly
across
the
red
sandstone
pavement
of
the
court
the
figure
carried
an
oil
lamp
which
illuminated
a
bearded
face
framed
in
a
white
shawl
you
are
welcome
in
the
name
of
allah
the
figure
bowed
a
greeting
what
brings
armed
men
to
our
door
it
is
too
late
now
to
pray
we
long
ago
sounded
the
last
his
majesty
has
sent
a
to
be
cared
for
by
you
for
two
days
nadir
sharif
stepped
forward
he
was
injured
today
during
our
hands
are
always
open
the
figure
turned
and
moved
across
the
plaza
toward
a
building
that
looked
in
the
new
moonlight
to
be
a
mosque
when
they
reached
the
entrance
the
man
turned
and
spoke
to
the
rajputs
in
a
language
hawksworth
did
not
understand
he
says
this
is
the
house
of
god
nadir
sharif
translated
he
has
commanded
the
rajputs
to
leave
their
shoes
and
their
weapons
here
if
they
wish
to
follow
i
think
they
will
refuse
perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
we
all
left
you
now
you
be
well
cared
for
day
after
tomorrow
i
send
a
horse
for
you
what
going
on
you
mean
i
going
to
be
here
alone
hawksworth
suddenly
realized
he
was
being
abandoned
at
an
abandoned
city
he
whirled
on
nadir
sharif
you
suggested
this
you
brought
me
here
what
the
hell
is
this
for
i
could
have
returned
to
agra
or
even
stayed
with
the
hunt
you
a
perceptive
man
ambassador
nadir
sharif
smiled
and
looked
up
at
the
moon
but
as
far
as
i
know
you
here
entirely
by
coincidence
i
can
not
be
responsible
for
anything
that
happens
to
you
or
anyone
you
see
this
is
merely
the
hand
of
chance
please
try
to
understand
what
do
you
mean
i
will
see
you
in
two
days
ambassador
enjoy
your
rest
nadir
sharif
bowed
and
in
moments
he
and
the
rajputs
had
melted
into
the
moonlight
hawksworth
watched
them
leave
with
a
mounting
sense
of
disquiet
then
he
turned
and
peered
past
the
hooded
figure
who
stood
waiting
the
mosque
looked
empty
a
cavern
of
flickering
shadows
against
intricate
plaster
calligraphy
he
unbuckled
the
sheath
of
his
sword
and
passed
it
to
the
man
as
he
kicked
away
his
loose
slippers
the
man
took
the
sword
without
a
word
examined
it
for
a
moment
as
though
evaluating
its
workmanship
then
turned
to
lead
the
way
they
moved
silently
across
the
polished
stone
floor
past
enormous
columns
that
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
vaulted
space
above
them
hawksworth
relished
the
coolness
of
the
stones
against
his
bare
feet
then
ducked
barely
in
time
to
avoid
a
hanging
lamp
extinguished
now
its
polished
metalwork
almost
invisible
against
the
gloom
ahead
a
lamp
flickered
through
the
dark
they
passed
beneath
it
then
stopped
at
a
closed
door
at
the
rear
of
the
mosque
the
man
spoke
a
word
hawksworth
did
not
understand
and
the
door
was
swung
open
from
the
inside
revealing
an
illuminated
passageway
four
men
were
waiting
as
hawksworth
and
his
guide
passed
through
the
door
closed
behind
them
and
the
men
silently
drew
around
the
passageway
was
long
freshly
plastered
and
floored
in
marble
mosaic
it
was
cool
as
though
immune
from
the
heat
of
the
day
and
scented
faintly
with
rose
incense
that
had
been
blended
with
the
oil
in
the
hanging
lamps
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
was
another
stairway
again
of
white
marble
and
as
they
moved
up
its
steps
the
man
who
had
greeted
hawksworth
extinguished
his
lamp
with
a
brass
cup
he
carried
beyond
the
stair
was
another
corridor
then
another
door
that
opened
as
they
approached
hawksworth
realized
they
were
in
an
upper
story
of
a
large
building
directly
behind
the
mosque
they
passed
through
the
door
and
emerged
into
a
room
facing
a
balcony
that
overlooked
the
abandoned
square
below
in
the
center
of
the
room
was
a
raised
dais
covered
with
a
thick
persian
carpet
the
man
who
had
been
hawksworth
guide
moved
to
the
dais
mounted
it
and
seated
himself
with
a
flourish
he
dropped
his
white
hood
and
the
wrap
that
had
been
around
him
hawksworth
realized
with
a
shock
that
his
long
white
hair
streamed
to
his
waist
he
was
naked
save
for
a
loincloth
he
gestured
for
hawksworth
to
sit
indicating
a
bolster
welcome
english
he
waited
until
the
surprise
had
registered
in
hawksworth
face
we
been
expecting
you
but
not
quite
so
soon
who
are
you
i
was
once
a
persian
he
smiled
but
i
almost
forgotten
my
country
manners
first
i
should
offer
you
some
refreshment
and
only
then
turn
to
affairs
normally
i
would
offer
but
i
understand
you
prefer
wine
hawksworth
stared
at
him
speechless
no
pious
muslim
would
drink
wine
that
much
he
knew
do
look
so
surprised
we
persian
poets
often
drink
wine
for
divine
inspiration
he
laughed
broadly
at
least
that
our
excuse
perhaps
allah
will
forgive
us
garden
of
flowers
a
cup
of
wine
mark
the
repose
of
a
joyous
mind
he
signaled
one
of
the
men
and
a
chalice
of
wine
appeared
seemingly
from
nowhere
i
once
learned
a
latin
expression
vino
veritas
as
a
christian
you
must
know
it
wine
there
is
truth
have
some
wine
and
we
will
search
for
truth
together
let
start
with
some
truth
from
you
how
do
you
know
so
much
about
me
and
you
still
have
told
me
who
you
are
who
am
i
you
know
that
the
most
important
question
you
can
ask
any
man
let
us
say
i
am
one
who
has
forsworn
everything
the
world
would
have
and
thereby
found
the
one
thing
most
others
have
lost
he
smiled
easily
can
you
guess
what
that
is
tell
me
my
own
freedom
to
make
verse
to
drink
wine
to
love
i
have
nothing
now
that
can
be
taken
away
so
i
live
without
fear
i
am
a
muslim
reviled
by
the
mullahs
a
poet
denounced
by
the
moghul
court
versifiers
a
teacher
rejected
by
those
who
no
longer
care
to
learn
i
live
here
because
there
is
no
other
place
i
can
be
perhaps
i
soon
will
be
gone
but
right
here
right
now
i
am
free
because
i
bear
nothing
but
love
for
those
who
would
harm
me
he
stared
out
over
the
balcony
for
a
moment
in
silence
show
me
the
man
who
lives
in
fear
of
death
and
i
will
show
you
one
already
dead
in
his
soul
show
me
the
man
who
knows
hate
and
i
will
show
you
one
who
can
never
truly
know
love
he
paused
again
and
once
more
the
room
grew
heavy
with
silence
love
english
love
is
the
sweetness
of
desert
honey
it
is
life
itself
but
you
i
think
have
yet
to
know
its
taste
because
you
are
a
slave
to
your
own
striving
but
until
you
give
all
else
over
as
i
have
done
you
can
never
truly
know
love
how
do
you
think
you
know
so
much
about
me
i
know
nothing
about
you
or
about
why
i
here
but
i
think
you
heard
of
me
hawksworth
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
and
suddenly
everything
came
together
he
could
have
shouted
his
realization
you
samad
the
sufi
he
stopped
his
heart
racing
where
is
yes
i
a
poet
and
i
called
a
sufi
because
there
is
nothing
else
to
call
me
you
not
really
a
sufi
who
knows
what
a
sufi
is
my
english
friend
not
even
a
sufi
knows
sufis
do
not
teach
beliefs
they
merely
ask
that
you
know
who
you
are
i
thought
they
supposed
to
be
mystics
like
some
of
the
spanish
catholics
mystics
yearn
to
merge
with
god
to
find
that
part
within
us
all
that
is
god
sufis
teach
methods
for
clearing
away
the
clutter
that
obscures
our
knowledge
of
who
we
are
so
perhaps
we
mystics
but
we
not
beloved
by
the
mullahs
why
not
sufis
are
muslims
because
sufis
ignore
them
the
mullahs
say
we
must
guide
our
lives
by
the
laws
of
the
prophet
but
sufis
know
god
can
only
be
reached
through
love
a
pure
life
counts
for
nothing
if
the
heart
is
impure
prayers
five
times
a
day
are
empty
words
if
there
is
no
love
samad
paused
again
and
then
spoke
slowly
and
quietly
i
am
trying
to
decide
if
then
is
love
about
you
english
you
seem
to
think
you
know
a
lot
about
me
there
only
one
person
who
wanted
me
to
meet
you
and
she
was
in
surat
where
is
she
now
is
she
here
she
no
longer
in
surat
be
sure
of
that
but
at
this
moment
you
are
here
with
me
why
always
seek
after
what
you
do
not
have
you
see
i
do
know
much
about
you
you
a
pilgrim
he
waved
his
hand
absently
but
then
we
all
are
pilgrims
all
searching
for
something
we
call
it
different
names
fulfillment
knowledge
beauty
god
but
you
still
have
not
found
what
you
seek
is
that
not
true
samad
watched
hawksworth
in
silence
as
he
drank
from
his
own
wineglass
yes
it
is
given
many
names
but
it
is
in
fact
only
one
thing
we
are
all
searching
my
english
for
our
own
self
but
the
self
is
not
easy
to
find
so
we
travel
afar
hoping
it
lies
elsewhere
searching
inward
in
a
much
more
difficult
journey
hawksworth
started
to
speak
but
samad
silenced
him
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
know
that
you
will
find
the
thing
you
most
want
only
when
you
cease
to
search
only
then
can
you
listen
to
the
quiet
of
the
heart
only
then
can
you
find
true
content
samad
drank
again
from
his
wine
this
last
week
you
have
found
so
you
think
your
fortune
you
have
received
worldly
honors
from
the
moghul
you
have
news
of
imminent
success
for
your
english
king
but
these
things
will
only
bring
you
despair
in
the
end
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
samad
laughed
and
finished
off
his
glass
then
let
me
tell
you
a
story
about
myself
english
i
was
born
a
persian
jew
a
merchant
at
my
birth
by
historic
family
vocation
but
my
people
have
ignored
the
greatest
prophet
of
all
the
prophet
mohammed
his
voice
invites
all
and
i
heard
that
voice
i
became
muslim
but
still
i
was
a
merchant
a
persian
merchant
and
perhaps
not
unlike
you
i
traveled
to
india
search
of
not
the
greater
prophet
but
the
baser
profit
and
here
my
english
i
found
the
other
thing
i
searched
for
i
found
love
pure
love
consuming
love
the
kind
of
love
few
men
are
privileged
to
know
the
love
of
a
boy
whose
beauty
and
purity
could
only
have
come
from
god
but
this
love
was
mistaken
by
the
world
was
called
impure
and
he
was
hidden
from
me
so
the
only
one
left
for
me
to
love
was
god
thus
i
cast
away
my
garments
my
worldliness
and
gave
myself
to
him
and
once
more
i
was
misunderstood
samad
paused
and
called
for
another
glass
of
wine
then
he
turned
back
to
hawksworth
so
i
have
told
the
world
my
story
in
verse
and
now
there
are
many
who
understand
not
the
mullahs
but
the
people
i
have
given
them
words
that
could
only
come
from
a
pure
heart
words
of
joy
that
all
men
can
share
samad
stopped
and
smiled
you
know
we
persians
are
born
poets
it
said
we
changed
sufism
from
mystic
speculation
to
mystic
art
all
i
know
is
the
great
poets
of
persia
found
in
sufism
a
vehicle
for
their
art
that
gave
back
to
islam
almost
more
than
it
took
but
then
a
poet
vocation
must
always
be
to
give
i
have
given
the
people
of
india
my
heart
and
they
have
loved
me
in
return
yet
such
love
engenders
envy
in
the
minds
of
men
who
know
it
not
the
mullahs
would
have
condemned
me
for
heresy
long
ago
were
it
not
for
one
man
a
man
who
has
understood
and
protected
me
the
only
man
in
india
who
is
not
afraid
of
he
persian
at
court
and
now
he
too
is
gone
with
him
went
my
life
and
who
was
that
can
you
not
guess
you
have
already
met
him
samad
smiled
prince
jadar
hawksworth
suddenly
felt
as
though
the
world
had
closed
about
him
why
did
you
contrive
to
get
me
here
tonight
because
i
wished
to
see
you
and
i
can
no
longer
walk
abroad
it
has
been
forbidden
on
pain
of
death
but
death
is
something
i
am
almost
ready
to
welcome
one
day
soon
i
will
walk
the
streets
of
agra
once
more
for
the
last
time
hawksworth
wondered
if
the
claim
was
bravado
or
truth
but
why
did
you
want
to
see
me
hawksworth
studied
samad
closely
suddenly
he
decided
to
ask
the
question
directly
to
ask
me
to
help
jadar
you
can
tell
him
for
me
that
i
want
no
part
of
his
politics
here
to
get
a
trade
agreement
a
that
my
mission
why
i
was
sent
samad
settled
his
wineglass
on
the
carpet
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
you
heard
nothing
i
have
said
i
am
telling
you
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
forget
about
your
your
destiny
is
no
longer
in
your
hands
but
if
you
will
open
your
heart
you
will
find
it
has
riches
to
compensate
you
manyfold
still
they
can
be
yours
only
if
you
can
know
love
but
now
i
fear
the
only
love
you
know
is
ambition
you
have
not
yet
understood
it
is
empty
as
mirror
the
world
is
but
a
waking
dream
the
eye
of
heart
sees
clear
the
garden
of
this
tempting
world
is
wrought
of
sand
and
tear
hawksworth
shifted
and
stared
about
the
room
it
was
darker
now
but
several
men
had
entered
few
of
them
seemed
to
understand
turki
so
what
do
i
do
now
stay
with
us
for
a
while
learn
to
know
yourself
samad
rose
and
stepped
off
the
dais
perhaps
then
you
will
at
last
find
what
you
want
he
motioned
for
hawksworth
to
walk
with
him
to
the
balcony
across
the
courtyard
a
single
lamp
burned
in
the
turret
of
one
of
the
buildings
tonight
must
be
remembered
as
a
dream
my
english
and
like
a
dream
it
is
to
be
recalled
on
waking
as
mere
light
and
shadow
he
turned
and
led
hawksworth
to
the
door
the
men
stood
aside
for
them
and
now
i
bid
you
farewell
others
will
attend
you
hawksworth
walked
into
the
marble
corridor
standing
in
the
her
face
warm
in
the
glow
of
a
lamp
was
shirin
chapter
the
night
sky
above
the
courtyard
was
afire
an
overturned
jewel
box
strewn
about
an
ivory
moon
they
passed
through
a
gateway
of
carved
columns
and
ornate
brackets
into
a
smaller
plaza
the
mosque
was
left
behind
around
them
low
were
empty
pavilions
several
stories
high
decorated
with
whimsical
carvings
railings
cornices
now
they
were
alone
in
the
abandoned
palace
surrounded
by
silence
and
moonlight
only
then
did
she
speak
her
voice
opening
through
the
stillness
i
promised
to
think
of
you
and
i
have
more
than
you
can
know
tonight
i
want
to
share
this
with
you
the
private
palace
of
the
great
akman
the
most
beautiful
place
in
all
india
she
paused
and
pointed
to
a
wide
marble
pond
in
the
middle
of
the
plaza
in
its
center
was
a
platform
surrounded
by
a
railing
and
joined
to
the
banks
by
delicate
bridges
they
say
when
akman
court
musician
the
revered
tansen
sat
there
and
sang
a
raga
for
the
rainy
season
the
clouds
themselves
would
come
to
listen
and
bless
the
earth
with
their
tears
once
all
this
was
covered
by
one
magnificent
canopy
tonight
we
have
only
the
stars
how
did
you
arrange
this
he
still
was
lost
in
astonishment
do
ask
me
to
tell
you
now
can
we
just
share
this
moment
she
took
his
arm
and
motioned
ahead
there
glistening
in
the
moonlight
were
the
open
arcades
of
a
palace
pavilion
i
prepared
something
especially
for
us
she
guided
him
through
a
archway
and
into
a
large
arcade
illuminated
by
a
single
oil
lamp
atop
a
stone
table
in
front
of
them
on
the
walls
were
brilliantly
colored
renderings
of
elephants
horses
birds
she
picked
up
the
lamp
and
led
him
past
the
paintings
and
into
the
next
room
a
vast
red
chamber
whose
floor
was
a
fragrant
standing
pool
of
water
in
the
flickering
light
he
could
see
a
marble
stairway
leading
to
a
red
sandstone
platform
projecting
out
over
the
water
supported
by
square
stone
columns
topped
by
ornate
brackets
this
is
where
akman
spent
the
hot
summer
nights
up
there
on
the
platform
above
a
cooling
pool
of
rosewater
from
there
he
would
summon
his
women
to
come
to
him
from
the
hawksworth
dipped
his
fingers
into
the
water
and
brought
it
to
his
lips
it
was
like
perfume
he
turned
to
he
and
she
smiled
yes
the
sufis
still
keep
rosewater
here
in
memory
of
akman
she
urged
him
forward
up
the
stairs
come
and
together
we
try
to
imagine
how
it
must
have
felt
to
be
the
great
moghul
of
india
as
they
emerged
onto
the
platform
the
vaulted
ceiling
above
them
glowed
a
ruby
red
from
the
lamp
under
their
feet
was
a
thick
carpet
strewn
with
small
velvet
bolsters
at
the
farthest
edge
was
a
large
sleeping
couch
fashioned
from
red
marble
its
dark
velvet
canopy
held
aloft
by
four
finely
worked
stone
columns
the
covering
of
the
couch
was
a
patterned
blue
velvet
bordered
in
gold
lace
just
for
tonight
i
made
this
room
like
it
was
when
akman
slept
here
with
his
chosen
from
the
she
slipped
the
gauze
wrap
from
her
shoulders
he
looked
at
her
dark
hair
secured
with
a
transparent
scarf
and
a
strand
of
pearls
and
realized
it
contrasted
perfectly
with
the
green
emerald
brooch
that
swung
gently
against
her
forehead
she
wore
a
necklace
of
pearl
strands
and
about
each
upper
arm
was
a
band
ringed
with
pearl
drops
her
eyes
and
eyebrows
were
painted
dark
with
kohl
and
her
lips
were
a
brilliant
red
without
a
word
she
took
a
garland
of
yellow
flowers
from
the
bed
and
gently
slipped
it
over
his
head
next
to
the
couch
was
a
round
rosewood
table
holding
several
small
brass
vials
of
perfume
and
incense
tonight
this
room
is
like
a
bridal
chamber
for
us
a
second
garland
of
flowers
lay
on
the
bed
next
to
the
one
she
had
taken
without
thinking
he
reached
and
took
it
and
slipped
it
around
her
neck
then
he
drew
his
fingertips
slowly
down
her
arm
sending
a
small
shiver
through
them
both
seeing
her
in
the
lamplight
he
realized
again
how
he
had
ached
for
her
a
wedding
for
us
not
a
wedding
can
we
just
call
it
a
new
beginning
the
end
of
one
journey
and
the
beginning
of
another
hawksworth
heard
a
sudden
rustling
behind
him
and
then
a
sound
he
turned
and
searched
the
gloom
where
two
eyes
peered
out
of
the
darkness
reflecting
the
lamplight
he
was
reaching
for
his
pistol
when
she
stopped
his
arm
that
one
of
the
little
green
parrots
who
live
here
they
never
been
harmed
and
they
never
been
caged
so
they
unafraid
she
turned
and
called
to
it
if
they
caught
and
imprisoned
their
spirit
dies
and
their
beauty
starts
to
fade
the
bird
ruffled
its
wings
again
and
flew
to
the
top
of
the
bolster
beside
shirin
hawksworth
watched
her
for
a
moment
still
incredulous
then
settled
himself
on
the
carpet
next
to
a
chalice
of
wine
that
sat
waiting
she
reached
and
touched
his
arm
i
never
asked
you
what
your
lovers
call
you
you
so
important
nobody
in
india
knows
your
first
name
just
your
titles
my
only
other
name
is
brian
he
found
her
touch
had
already
begun
to
stir
him
brian
will
you
tell
me
everything
about
you
what
you
like
and
what
you
do
she
began
to
pour
the
wine
for
them
did
i
ever
tell
you
what
i
like
most
about
you
in
surat
you
said
you
liked
the
fact
i
was
a
european
who
always
had
to
be
master
of
worldly
things
well
i
thought
about
you
a
lot
since
then
her
expression
grew
pensive
i
decided
it
not
so
simple
there
a
directness
about
you
and
an
openness
an
honesty
that
very
appealing
that
european
we
not
very
good
at
intrigue
what
we
thinking
always
shows
on
our
face
she
laughed
and
i
think
i
know
what
you
thinking
right
now
but
let
me
finish
i
feel
i
must
tell
you
this
there
something
else
about
you
that
may
also
be
european
but
think
it
just
your
special
quality
you
always
ready
to
watch
and
learn
from
what
you
see
looking
for
new
things
and
new
ideas
is
that
also
european
i
think
it
probably
is
it
rare
here
most
indians
think
everything
they
have
and
everything
they
do
is
absolutely
perfect
exactly
the
way
it
is
they
might
take
something
foreign
and
use
it
or
copy
it
but
they
always
have
to
appear
disdainful
of
anything
not
indian
you
right
i
always
being
told
everything
here
is
better
he
reached
for
her
sometimes
it
even
true
wo
you
let
me
tell
you
the
rest
she
took
his
hand
and
held
it
i
also
think
you
have
more
concern
for
those
around
you
than
most
indians
do
you
respect
the
dignity
of
others
regardless
of
their
station
something
you
seldom
see
here
particularly
among
the
high
castes
and
there
a
kindness
about
you
too
i
feel
it
when
you
with
me
she
laughed
again
you
know
it
a
tragic
thing
about
muslim
men
they
claim
to
honor
women
they
write
poems
to
their
beauty
but
i
do
think
they
could
ever
truly
love
a
woman
they
believe
she
a
willful
thing
whom
it
their
duty
to
contain
she
paused
then
continued
but
you
so
very
different
it
hard
to
comprehend
you
sometimes
you
love
your
european
music
but
now
i
think
you
starting
to
understand
and
love
the
music
of
india
i
even
heard
you
learning
the
sitar
you
sensitive
to
all
beauty
almost
the
way
samad
is
it
makes
me
feel
very
comfortable
with
you
but
also
a
lot
like
prince
jadar
you
not
afraid
of
risks
you
guide
your
own
destiny
instead
of
just
accepting
whatever
happens
the
way
most
indians
do
she
smiled
and
traced
her
fingers
down
his
chest
that
part
makes
you
very
exciting
she
hesitated
again
and
do
you
know
what
i
like
least
about
you
the
you
wear
he
burst
into
laughter
tell
me
why
they
so
undignified
when
i
first
saw
you
that
night
you
came
to
mukarrab
khan
palace
i
could
believe
you
could
be
anyone
of
importance
then
the
next
morning
at
the
observatory
you
looked
like
a
nobleman
tonight
you
dressed
like
a
i
like
boots
and
a
leather
jerkin
when
i
wearing
a
fancy
doublet
and
hose
then
i
feel
i
have
to
be
false
false
as
the
clothes
and
when
i
dress
like
a
moghul
i
always
wonder
if
people
think
i
trying
to
be
something
i
not
all
right
she
smiled
resignedly
but
perhaps
sometime
tonight
you
at
least
take
off
your
leather
jerkin
i
would
enjoy
seeing
you
he
looked
at
her
in
wonderment
i
still
do
understand
you
at
all
you
once
said
you
thought
i
was
powerful
but
you
seem
to
be
pretty
powerful
yourself
nobody
i
know
could
force
mukarrab
khan
or
nadir
sharif
to
do
anything
yet
you
made
the
governor
divorce
you
and
then
you
made
the
prime
minister
deceive
half
of
agra
to
arrange
this
you
so
many
different
things
do
forget
sometimes
i
also
a
woman
she
rose
and
began
to
slowly
draw
out
the
long
cinch
holding
the
waist
of
her
wrap
her
halter
seemed
to
trouble
her
as
she
tried
to
loosen
it
she
laughed
at
her
own
awkwardness
and
then
it
too
came
away
she
was
left
with
only
her
jewels
and
the
long
scarf
over
her
hair
which
she
did
not
remove
then
she
turned
to
him
do
you
still
remember
our
last
night
in
surat
do
you
he
looked
at
her
in
the
dim
lamplight
the
line
of
her
body
was
flawless
with
gently
rounded
breasts
perfect
thighs
legs
lithe
yet
strong
i
remember
what
i
felt
when
i
kissed
you
he
laughed
and
moved
to
take
her
in
his
arms
but
i
thought
i
was
the
one
who
kissed
you
maybe
we
should
try
it
once
more
and
decide
with
a
mischievous
look
she
caught
his
arms
and
wrapped
herself
around
him
as
he
touched
her
lips
she
turned
abruptly
and
the
world
suddenly
seemed
to
twist
crazily
around
them
sending
his
head
spinning
in
shock
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
it
was
flooded
with
the
essence
of
rose
the
pool
beneath
the
platform
had
broken
their
fall
he
came
up
gasping
and
found
her
lips
she
tasted
of
another
world
sweet
fragrant
he
enclosed
her
slowly
in
his
arms
clasping
her
lean
body
gently
at
first
then
feeling
more
and
more
of
her
warmth
he
pressed
her
to
him
both
of
them
still
gasping
they
seemed
to
float
weightless
serene
in
the
darkness
awkwardly
he
began
pulling
away
his
wet
jerkin
you
just
as
i
imagined
her
hands
traveled
across
his
chest
lightly
caressing
his
skin
while
the
lamp
flickered
against
the
paintings
on
the
walls
above
them
there
a
strength
about
you
a
roughness
she
nuzzled
his
chest
with
her
face
tonight
will
you
let
me
be
your
poet
tonight
you
can
be
anything
you
want
i
want
to
sing
of
you
a
man
i
adore
of
the
desire
i
feel
for
you
after
we
know
each
other
fully
the
great
longing
will
be
gone
the
most
intense
moment
we
can
ever
share
will
be
past
the
ache
of
wanting
what
you
just
said
reminds
me
of
something
john
donne
once
wrote
who
is
he
one
of
our
english
poets
and
songwriters
but
he
had
a
slightly
different
idea
he
hesitated
then
smiled
to
tell
the
truth
i
think
i
may
like
his
better
she
lifted
herself
up
in
the
water
rose
petals
patterned
across
her
body
then
tell
me
what
he
said
it
the
only
poem
of
his
i
can
still
remember
but
only
the
first
verse
for
some
reason
i
never
forget
it
i
sometimes
think
of
it
when
i
think
of
you
let
me
say
it
in
english
first
and
then
try
to
translate
i
wonder
by
my
troth
what
thou
and
i
did
till
we
lov
were
we
not
wean
till
then
but
suck
on
country
pleasures
childishly
or
snorted
we
in
the
seven
sleepers
den
was
so
but
this
all
pleasures
fancies
be
if
ever
any
beauty
i
did
see
which
i
desir
and
got
was
but
a
dream
of
thee
she
listened
to
the
hard
english
rhythm
and
then
to
his
translation
awkward
and
halting
then
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
floating
her
hand
across
the
surface
of
the
pond
you
know
i
also
wonder
now
what
i
did
before
i
met
you
before
i
held
you
she
slipped
her
hands
about
his
neck
and
as
she
did
he
drew
her
up
out
of
the
water
and
cradled
her
against
him
then
he
lifted
her
her
body
still
strewn
with
rose
petals
and
carried
her
slowly
up
the
marble
stairs
to
the
couch
of
akman
he
felt
her
cling
to
him
like
no
woman
ever
had
and
as
he
placed
her
on
the
bed
she
took
his
face
in
her
hands
and
kissed
him
for
a
long
moment
then
he
heard
her
whisper
tonight
we
will
know
just
each
other
and
there
will
be
nothing
else
and
they
gave
each
to
each
until
there
was
nothing
more
to
give
because
each
was
the
other
together
complete
he
was
on
the
quarterdeck
the
whipstaff
aching
against
his
hand
the
mainsail
furled
as
storm
winds
lashed
the
waist
of
the
ship
with
wave
after
powerful
wave
the
ship
was
the
his
vessel
when
he
sailed
for
the
levant
company
and
the
rocks
that
towered
off
his
starboard
bow
were
gibraltar
he
shouted
into
the
dark
for
the
quartermaster
to
reef
the
and
he
leaned
on
the
whipstaff
to
bring
her
about
but
neither
responded
he
had
no
crew
he
was
being
swept
helpless
toward
the
empty
darkness
that
lay
ahead
another
wave
caught
him
across
the
face
and
somewhere
in
the
dark
came
a
screech
as
though
the
sea
had
given
up
some
dying
leviathan
beast
his
seaboots
were
losing
their
hold
on
the
quarterdeck
and
now
the
whipstaff
had
grown
sharp
talons
that
cut
into
his
hand
then
a
woman
voice
a
distant
siren
calling
him
again
the
screech
and
then
yet
another
wave
cut
across
his
face
the
water
tasted
of
roses
he
jerked
violently
awake
on
his
hand
a
green
parrot
was
perched
preening
itself
and
ruffling
its
feathers
and
from
the
pool
below
shirin
was
flinging
handfuls
of
water
up
over
the
side
of
the
platform
laughing
as
she
tried
to
splash
his
face
she
was
floating
naked
below
him
her
hair
streaming
out
across
the
surface
of
the
water
tangled
among
the
drifting
rose
petals
he
looked
about
and
saw
his
own
wet
clothes
mingled
among
her
silks
and
jewels
for
a
moment
he
felt
again
the
terror
of
the
dream
the
rudderless
ship
impelled
by
something
beyond
control
and
then
he
caught
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
slipped
over
the
side
the
water
was
cool
against
his
skin
and
involuntarily
he
caught
his
breath
then
he
reached
out
and
wrapped
her
in
his
arms
pulling
her
against
him
she
turned
her
face
to
his
twined
her
hair
around
his
head
and
crushed
his
lips
with
her
own
just
as
suddenly
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
with
joy
he
found
himself
laughing
with
her
why
do
we
both
just
stay
i
do
have
to
be
back
in
agra
until
the
wedding
we
could
have
a
week
he
studied
the
perfect
lines
of
her
face
the
dark
eyes
at
once
defiant
and
anxious
and
wished
he
could
hold
her
forever
the
worshipful
east
india
company
be
damned
but
we
both
have
things
we
must
do
she
revolved
in
the
flowered
water
and
drew
her
face
above
his
she
kissed
him
again
languorously
then
she
drew
herself
out
of
the
water
and
twisted
a
wrap
around
her
covering
her
breasts
both
you
and
i
and
what
this
thing
you
have
to
do
her
eyes
shadowed
one
thing
i
must
try
to
do
is
convince
samad
he
can
not
stay
here
any
longer
he
has
to
go
south
where
prince
jadar
can
protect
him
but
he
refuses
to
listen
and
time
is
growing
short
now
i
truly
fear
for
what
may
happen
to
him
after
the
wedding
the
persian
mullahs
will
certainly
be
powerful
enough
then
to
demand
he
be
tried
and
executed
on
charges
of
heresy
for
violating
some
obscure
precept
of
islamic
law
it
will
be
the
end
for
him
she
paused
and
for
anyone
who
has
helped
him
then
if
he
wo
leave
at
least
you
should
he
lifted
himself
out
of
the
water
and
settled
beside
her
on
the
marble
paving
why
do
you
come
back
to
england
with
me
when
the
fleet
from
bantam
makes
landfall
at
surat
arangbar
will
surely
have
the
courage
to
sign
the
and
then
my
mission
will
be
finished
it
should
only
be
a
matter
of
weeks
regardless
of
what
the
portugals
try
to
do
she
studied
the
water
of
the
pool
with
sadness
in
her
eyes
and
said
nothing
for
a
moment
as
she
kicked
the
surface
lightly
neither
of
us
is
master
of
what
will
happen
things
are
going
to
soon
be
out
of
control
for
both
of
us
things
are
going
to
happen
that
you
will
not
understand
hawksworth
squinted
through
the
what
going
to
happen
who
can
know
but
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
prince
betrayed
totally
in
one
final
act
that
will
eventually
destroy
him
he
is
too
isolated
too
weak
and
when
that
happens
we
all
doomed
even
you
though
i
do
think
you
believe
that
now
why
should
i
i
not
betting
on
prince
jadar
i
agree
with
you
i
do
think
he
has
a
chance
i
betting
on
a
arangbar
and
soon
you
never
get
a
the
moghul
and
arangbar
will
be
gone
in
half
a
year
the
queen
has
already
started
appearing
at
morning
directing
his
decisions
at
afternoon
as
soon
as
she
has
allaudin
under
her
control
arangbar
will
be
finished
mark
it
he
die
from
too
much
opium
or
from
some
mysterious
poison
or
accident
he
will
cease
to
exist
to
matter
i
do
believe
it
he
seems
pretty
well
in
control
if
that
what
you
think
then
you
are
very
deceived
he
ca
live
much
longer
everyone
knows
it
perhaps
even
he
knows
it
in
his
heart
soon
he
will
give
up
even
the
appearance
of
rule
then
the
queen
will
take
full
command
of
the
imperial
army
and
prince
jadar
will
be
hunted
down
like
a
wild
boar
he
studied
her
not
sure
he
could
reasonable
contradict
her
and
felt
his
stomach
knot
what
will
happen
to
you
if
the
queen
takes
over
i
do
know
but
i
do
know
i
love
you
i
truly
do
how
sad
it
makes
me
that
i
ca
tell
you
everything
her
eyes
darkened
and
she
took
his
hand
please
understand
i
did
not
know
the
prince
would
use
you
the
way
he
has
but
it
is
for
good
try
to
believe
that
what
do
you
mean
she
hesitated
and
looked
away
let
me
ask
you
this
what
do
you
think
the
prince
will
do
after
the
wedding
i
do
know
but
i
think
he
be
very
wise
to
keep
clear
of
agra
nobody
at
court
will
even
talk
about
him
now
at
least
not
openly
still
i
think
he
might
be
able
to
stay
alive
if
he
careful
if
he
survives
the
campaign
in
the
deccan
maybe
he
can
bargain
something
out
of
the
queen
but
i
agree
with
you
about
one
thing
she
can
finish
him
any
time
she
wants
i
understand
she
already
has
de
facto
control
of
the
imperial
army
in
arangbar
name
of
course
what
can
jadar
do
he
outnumbered
beyond
any
reasonable
odds
maybe
she
make
him
a
governor
in
the
south
if
he
does
challenge
her
do
you
really
believe
he
accept
that
ca
you
see
impossible
you
met
prince
jadar
do
you
think
he
just
give
up
that
the
one
thing
he
never
do
he
has
a
son
now
the
people
will
support
him
she
pulled
herself
next
to
him
i
feel
so
isolated
and
hopeless
just
thinking
about
it
all
i
so
glad
nadir
sharif
brought
you
here
he
slipped
his
arm
around
her
so
am
i
will
you
tell
me
now
how
you
managed
to
make
him
do
it
i
still
have
friends
left
in
agra
she
smiled
and
nadir
sharif
still
has
a
few
indiscretions
he
like
kept
buried
sometimes
he
can
be
persuaded
did
he
know
samad
was
here
if
he
did
before
he
does
now
but
he
wo
say
anything
anyway
it
hardly
matters
any
more
the
queen
probably
already
knows
here
she
sighed
the
worst
is
still
waiting
for
him
and
for
both
of
us
he
caught
a
handful
of
water
and
splashed
it
against
her
thigh
then
let
not
talk
about
it
until
tomorrow
the
worry
in
her
eyes
seemed
to
dissolve
and
she
laughed
do
you
realize
how
much
you
changed
since
i
first
met
you
you
were
as
stiff
as
a
portuguese
jesuit
then
before
kali
and
kamala
got
their
painted
fingernails
into
you
kali
the
lover
of
the
flesh
and
kamala
the
lover
of
the
spirit
she
glared
momentarily
now
i
must
take
care
lest
you
start
comparing
me
with
them
never
forget
different
i
believe
love
should
be
both
he
pulled
her
away
and
looked
at
her
face
i
amazed
by
how
different
you
are
i
still
have
no
idea
what
you
really
like
what
you
really
think
about
what
anything
everything
he
shrugged
about
this
even
you
mean
being
here
with
you
making
love
with
you
that
a
perfect
place
to
start
she
smiled
and
eased
back
in
the
water
silently
toying
for
a
moment
with
the
rose
petals
drifting
around
her
i
think
making
love
with
someone
is
how
we
share
our
deepest
feelings
things
we
ca
express
any
other
way
it
how
i
tell
you
my
love
for
you
she
paused
the
way
music
or
poetry
reveal
the
soul
of
the
one
who
creates
them
are
you
saying
you
think
lovemaking
is
like
creating
music
he
examined
her
puzzling
they
both
express
what
we
feel
inside
he
lifted
up
a
handful
of
water
and
watched
it
trickle
back
into
the
pool
i
never
thought
of
it
quite
like
that
before
why
not
it
true
before
you
can
create
music
you
have
to
teach
both
your
body
and
your
heart
it
the
same
with
making
love
what
do
you
mean
she
reached
and
touched
his
thigh
when
we
very
young
lovemaking
is
mostly
just
desire
we
may
think
it
more
but
it
is
really
then
gradually
we
learn
more
of
its
ways
how
to
give
and
receive
but
even
then
we
still
do
fully
understand
its
deeper
significance
we
like
a
novice
who
has
learned
the
techniques
of
the
sitar
the
way
to
strike
and
pull
a
string
to
make
one
note
blend
into
another
but
who
still
does
comprehend
the
spiritual
depth
of
a
raga
its
power
to
move
our
heart
we
still
do
understand
that
its
meaning
and
feeling
can
only
come
from
within
and
love
like
a
raga
is
an
expression
of
reverence
and
of
wonder
wonder
at
what
we
are
and
can
be
so
even
after
all
the
techniques
are
mastered
we
still
must
learn
to
experience
this
wonder
this
sense
of
our
spirit
becoming
one
with
the
other
otherwise
it
somehow
still
empty
like
perfect
music
that
has
no
feeling
no
life
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
trying
to
comprehend
what
she
was
saying
if
you
look
at
it
like
that
i
suppose
you
could
be
right
with
music
we
first
have
to
learn
its
language
then
learn
to
open
our
spirit
lovemaking
is
just
the
same
she
nestled
her
head
against
his
chest
sending
her
warmth
through
him
as
he
held
her
he
noticed
lying
alongside
the
pool
the
garland
of
flowers
she
had
worn
the
night
before
he
reached
and
took
it
and
slipped
it
over
her
head
then
he
kissed
her
gently
finding
he
was
indeed
filled
with
wonder
at
the
feeling
he
had
for
her
he
held
her
silently
for
a
time
looking
at
the
paintings
on
the
walls
of
the
palace
around
them
then
he
noticed
a
large
straw
basket
at
the
entryway
what
is
that
he
pointed
she
rose
and
looked
i
think
it
something
samad
had
left
for
us
she
lifted
herself
out
of
the
water
and
holding
her
wrap
against
her
brought
the
basket
it
was
filled
with
fruits
and
melons
they
not
from
samarkand
or
kabul
like
you
probably
grown
accustomed
to
at
the
palace
in
agra
but
i
think
you
like
them
anyway
she
squinted
across
the
square
in
the
direction
of
the
mosque
i
love
samad
dearly
he
did
all
of
this
for
me
but
he
refuses
to
listen
to
anything
i
say
she
handed
him
an
apple
then
reached
and
took
some
grapes
you
know
i
think
he
secretly
wants
to
die
a
martyr
like
a
lover
eager
to
die
for
his
or
her
beloved
he
wants
to
die
for
his
wild
freedom
for
what
he
thinks
is
beautiful
perhaps
to
be
remembered
as
one
who
never
bowed
to
anyone
i
wish
i
had
his
strength
where
he
now
you
wo
see
him
any
more
but
he
still
here
he
have
food
sent
to
us
he
loves
me
like
a
daughter
and
he
happy
when
i
am
and
he
knows
now
you
make
me
happy
but
you
must
see
him
here
again
even
know
that
he
here
it
would
be
too
dangerous
for
you
perhaps
someday
if
we
all
still
alive
he
took
her
face
in
his
hands
and
held
it
up
to
him
you
have
as
much
strength
as
anyone
including
samad
and
i
want
to
get
you
away
from
here
before
your
strength
makes
you
do
something
foolish
i
love
you
more
than
my
own
life
and
i
love
you
like
i
never
loved
anyone
not
even
the
great
moghul
when
you
were
in
his
she
laughed
you
know
that
was
very
different
i
was
scarcely
more
than
a
girl
then
i
did
know
anything
you
learned
a
few
things
somewhere
he
remembered
the
night
past
still
astonished
the
way
she
had
in
the
learn
everything
about
lovemaking
but
nothing
about
love
she
rose
and
took
his
hand
together
they
walked
to
the
open
portico
of
the
palace
around
them
the
red
pavilions
were
empty
in
the
early
sunshine
the
morning
was
still
save
for
the
cries
of
the
green
parrots
who
scurried
across
eaves
and
peered
down
impassively
from
weathered
red
railings
and
banisters
his
gaze
followed
the
wide
arches
then
turned
to
her
dark
shining
hair
he
reached
out
and
stroked
it
tell
me
more
about
it
how
did
you
learn
turki
in
the
we
had
to
learn
it
even
though
arangbar
speaks
perfect
persian
she
turned
to
him
and
how
did
you
learn
to
understand
it
in
a
turkish
prison
he
laughed
it
seems
about
the
same
to
me
i
had
to
learn
it
too
will
you
tell
me
about
it
why
were
you
in
prison
like
you
i
had
no
choice
the
turks
took
a
ship
i
was
commanding
in
the
mediterranean
tell
me
what
happened
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
all
right
we
trade
you
tell
me
all
about
you
and
i
tell
you
everything
about
me
we
leave

nothing

she
reached
and
kissed
him
will
you
begin
first
chapter
the
imminent
wedding
of
prince
allaudin
and
princess
layla
was
a
momentous
event
in
the
history
of
the
moghul
empire
it
represented
the
final
merging
of
two
dynasties
one
that
of
the
moghul
akman
and
his
first
son
arangbar
was
in
direct
assent
from
the
mongols
of
the
steppes
who
had
conquered
india
by
the
sword
less
than
a
century
before
melding
under
one
rule
a
disorganized
array
of
muslim
and
hindu
states
the
other
dynasty
that
of
queen
janahara
her
persian
father
zainul
beg
her
brother
nadir
sharif
and
now
her
daughter
layla
represented
a
very
different
kind
of
conqueror
at
court
they
were
called
always
in
whispers
the
persian
junta
whereas
no
combination
of
forces
indigenous
to
india
even
the
recalcitrant
rajput
warrior
chieftains
of
the
northwest
had
ever
succeeded
in
wresting
power
from
the
invading
moghuls
this
extraordinary
persian
family
had
in
one
generation
come
to
rule
india
virtually
as
equals
with
the
dynasty
of
akman
assuming
the
power
that
the
decadent
arangbar
had
let
slowly
slip
away
with
the
marriage
of
queen
janahara
daughter
to
the
weakling
son
of
arangbar
a
son
she
was
carefully
promoting
to
the
role
of
the
last
element
in
the
persian
strategy
would
be
in
place
when
arangbar
died
or
was
dethroned
the
powerful
line
of
akman
who
had
unified
india
by
a
blend
of
force
and
diplomatic
marriages
would
be
supplanted
by
what
was
in
effect
a
palace
coup
the
persian
junta
would
have
positioned
itself
to
assume
effective
control
of
india
prince
allaudin
for
so
long
as
he
was
allowed
to
maintain
even
the
appearance
of
rule
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
titular
sovereign
queen
janahara
together
with
her
father
and
her
brother
would
be
the
real
ruler
of
india
the
queen
could
of
course
have
contented
herself
for
a
time
longer
merely
to
direct
arangbar
from
beside
the
throne
but
that
could
never
be
entirely
satisfactory
arangbar
still
wielded
power
when
he
so
chose
and
that
power
could
be
enormous
india
had
no
independent
judiciary
no
parliament
no
constitution
there
was
instead
and
only
the
word
of
the
moghul
criminals
were
brought
before
him
to
be
tried
and
sentenced
offices
of
state
were
filled
or
vacated
on
his
personal
whim
the
army
marched
at
his
word
and
he
owned
in
effect
a
large
part
of
indian
soil
since
large
estates
went
not
to
heirs
but
returned
to
the
moghul
when
their
current
owner
died
he
granted
lands
and
salaries
as
reward
for
loyalty
and
service
and
he
alone
granted
titles
seldom
in
history
had
a
land
so
vast
and
a
people
so
diverse
been
held
so
absolutely
under
the
unquestioned
rule
of
a
single
hand
queen
janahara
now
looked
confidently
forward
to
the
day
that
hand
would
be
hers
the
power
arangbar
now
possessed
was
thought
by
many
to
have
brought
his
own
undoing
originally
an
introspective
if
sometimes
whimsical
sovereign
whose
early
memoirs
were
filled
with
scientific
observations
on
india
fauna
and
flora
and
ruminations
on
the
philosophy
of
governing
he
had
become
slowly
dissolute
to
the
point
of
incapacity
a
man
who
had
forsworn
both
alcohol
and
drugs
until
well
into
his
third
decade
of
life
he
was
now
hopelessly
addicted
to
both
in
consequence
his
judgment
and
instincts
had
grown
ever
more
unreliable
and
since
all
appointments
of
salary
and
place
depended
on
his
word
alone
no
career
or
fortune
was
truly
secure
it
was
into
this
vacuum
of
sound
leadership
that
the
persian
junta
of
family
had
moved
the
persian
junta
was
supported
by
all
those
at
court
who
feared
arangbar
growing
caprice
by
other
influential
persians
by
the
powerful
mullahs
of
the
sect
of
islam
by
hindus
who
still
habored
historic
grievances
against
moghul
rule
and
by
the
portuguese
the
persian
junta
was
not
loved
but
it
did
not
need
to
be
loved
it
enjoyed
an
even
more
compelling
ingredient
for
success
it
was
feared
even
those
who
might
have
preferred
the
succession
of
prince
jadar
wisely
held
silent
the
tides
of
history
were
there
for
all
to
see
even
brian
hawksworth
saw
them
the
private
palace
of
zainul
beg
father
of
janahara
and
nadir
sharif
and
grandfather
of
princess
layla
was
more
modest
than
that
of
nadir
sharif
and
its
architecture
more
persian
almost
consciously
reminiscent
of
the
land
of
his
birth
it
lay
on
the
banks
of
the
jamuna
river
farther
down
from
the
palace
of
nadir
sharif
and
this
evening
it
was
brilliantly
illuminated
by
bonfires
along
the
riverside
even
the
river
itself
was
lighted
a
dozen
barks
filled
with
lamps
had
been
towed
upriver
from
the
red
fort
and
now
their
flames
cast
a
dazzling
white
sheen
over
the
pink
turrets
of
the
palace
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
jamuna
men
were
lighting
candles
and
floating
them
in
hollow
clay
pots
across
the
surface
of
the
water
where
they
drifted
gently
downstream
toward
the
red
fort
creating
a
line
of
illumination
that
would
eventually
stretch
for
miles
although
hawksworth
money
was
starting
to
grow
short
he
had
used
a
large
portion
of
what
was
left
to
purchase
a
new
pair
of
striped
indian
trousers
an
expensive
brocade
turban
and
ornate
velvet
slippers
he
alighted
from
his
palanquin
at
the
palace
gate
looking
like
a
moghul
grandee
to
be
greeted
almost
immediately
by
zainul
beg
eunuchs
and
ushered
into
the
main
hall
as
he
entered
the
eunuchs
directed
him
toward
a
large
silver
fish
stationed
by
the
door
it
was
ornamented
with
green
lapis
lazuli
scales
and
fitted
with
seven
spouts
shooting
thin
streams
of
rosewater
outward
into
a
large
basin
hawksworth
was
by
now
accustomed
to
this
moghul
ritual
and
he
quickly
removed
his
new
slippers
and
splashed
his
feet
in
the
basin
to
the
minimal
extent
acceptable
then
he
turned
and
made
his
way
through
the
line
of
nobles
reverently
awaiting
the
arrival
of
arangbar
he
had
become
such
a
familiar
sight
at
royal
gatherings
that
his
presence
excited
no
unusual
notice
the
marble
walls
of
the
hall
were
hung
with
new
persian
tapestries
and
the
floors
covered
with
silk
carpets
embroidered
with
silver
and
gold
at
the
corners
were
immense
vases
of
solid
gold
studded
with
precious
stones
that
sparkled
in
the
lamp
light
incense
burners
wrought
from
silver
hung
from
the
walls
servants
circulated
among
the
crowd
bearing
trays
of
rolled
betel
leaves
glasses
of
lemony
and
cups
of
green
milky
in
deference
to
the
ceremonial
significance
of
this
holy
muslim
occasion
there
would
be
no
wine
until
after
the
mullahs
had
left
hawksworth
decided
to
take
a
glass
of
wait
for
the
wine
he
strolled
through
the
buzzing
crowd
of
bejeweled
men
and
anonymous
veiled
women
and
reflected
on
the
bizarre
ceremonies
of
a
moghul
marriage
his
first
taste
had
come
only
the
previous
evening
when
he
had
been
invited
to
the
red
fort
to
witness
and
take
part
in
the
henna
the
square
just
below
the
where
birthday
weighing
was
held
only
two
weeks
before
had
been
cleared
and
made
ready
for
the
henna
ceremony
hawksworth
had
arrived
and
been
granted
a
place
near
nadir
sharif
and
arangbar
the
crowd
was
already
being
entertained
by
music
and
dancing
women
allaudin
was
there
slightly
nervous
in
anticipation
of
his
upcoming
ordeal
then
the
procession
arrived
women
of
the
into
the
courtyard
on
palanquins
in
a
line
bearing
henna
a
red
paste
extracted
from
the
plant
of
the
same
name
and
gifts
sent
from
layla
to
allaudin
the
bride
was
not
present
she
had
not
yet
been
seen
by
allaudin
or
any
of
his
family
including
arangbar
the
women
of
the
all
veiled
spread
before
the
moghul
the
gifts
that
on
this
night
the
bride
was
expected
to
present
to
the
bridegroom
the
eunuchs
bore
trays
which
had
been
covered
with
basketwork
raised
in
domes
over
which
were
thrown
draperies
of
gold
cloth
and
brocade
in
a
rainbow
of
colors
they
were
brought
before
allaudin
and
arangbar
and
uncovered
one
by
one
the
first
tray
was
of
beaten
silver
and
it
held
a
new
suit
for
the
bridegroom
a
tailored
cloak
and
trousers
woven
with
strands
of
gold
others
bore
gold
and
silver
vessels
containing
cosmetics
and
toiletries
collyrium
kohl
musky
perfumes
and
plates
of
sweets
betel
leaves
tied
with
strings
of
gold
and
a
confectionary
of
dried
fruits
and
preserves
the
eunuchs
also
brought
in
sprays
of
flowers
containing
disguised
fireworks
wheels
which
were
ignited
as
they
entered
to
create
a
startling
fiery
garden
of
color
next
the
women
led
allaudin
to
rooms
behind
the
where
he
was
dressed
in
the
new
clothes
provided
for
him
by
the
bride
bamboo
slats
were
placed
across
the
doorway
to
enable
the
to
watch
the
ceremony
while
he
was
gone
an
opening
was
prepared
in
the
screen
separating
the
the
courtyard
and
a
low
stool
was
placed
just
outside
the
screen
was
specially
constructed
to
allow
the
hands
and
feet
of
the
one
sitting
on
the
stool
to
be
reached
from
behind
it
when
allaudin
returned
he
assumed
his
place
again
beside
arangbar
shifting
occasionally
in
mild
discomfort
from
the
stiff
new
clothes
it
was
obvious
to
hawksworth
that
he
wished
to
appear
bored
by
the
ceremonies
but
his
eyes
betrayed
his
apprehension
then
a
eunuch
approached
and
announced
to
the
male
assembly
arangbar
allaudin
nadir
sharif
zainul
beg
and
a
retinue
of
other
men
with
vague
ties
to
royal
blood
who
were
waiting
at
the
center
of
the
courtyard
that
the
bridegroom
is
wanted
go
quickly
arangbar
pushed
allaudin
toward
the
stool
waiting
in
front
of
the
screen
covering
the
entrance
to
the
zenana
it
always
a
man
fate
to
be
made
the
fool
by
his
women
allaudin
marched
across
the
courtyard
with
as
much
dignity
as
his
stiff
new
clothes
allowed
and
seated
himself
with
a
flourish
on
the
stool
the
air
was
rich
with
incense
and
music
from
the
upper
balconies
as
hawksworth
and
the
other
male
guests
watched
women
from
behind
the
screen
ordered
allaudin
to
insert
his
hands
and
feet
through
the
new
holes
he
was
then
teased
and
fed
small
lumps
of
sugar
candy
while
the
women
behind
the
screen
began
to
tie
dark
red
cloths
soaked
in
a
paste
of
moist
leaves
of
henna
onto
his
hands
and
feet
this
ceremony
is
very
important
inglish
arangbar
had
beamed
with
satisfaction
as
he
watched
henna
is
a
charm
to
promote
their
union
the
women
anoint
the
bride
with
it
also
in
private
it
will
make
him
virile
and
her
fertile
as
the
women
continued
to
dye
allaudin
hands
and
feet
with
the
paste
musicians
and
singers
began
to
entertain
him
some
of
the
songs
all
extemporary
lauded
him
as
a
prince
among
men
while
others
rhapsodized
over
the
beauty
of
the
bride
listening
to
their
songs
hawksworth
had
to
remind
himself
that
none
of
the
singers
had
actually
seen
the
bride
whose
beauty
they
now
extolled
as
that
of
one
woman
in
thousands
then
the
singers
sang
of
the
impending
happiness
of
the
pair
as
inevitable
they
declared
as
that
paradise
awaiting
believers
after
life
on
earth
is
past
after
the
women
had
finished
their
task
allaudin
turned
to
face
the
assembled
men
wearing
a
vaguely
sheepish
expression
hawksworth
had
caught
himself
laughing
out
loud
at
the
preposterous
figure
allaudin
struck
standing
before
them
with
hands
and
feet
dripping
red
with
henna
then
he
noticed
a
group
of
veiled
women
filing
out
from
behind
the
screen
and
approaching
they
carried
a
silver
chalice
filled
with
red
henna
paste
the
women
stopped
in
front
of
arangbar
bowed
with
the
and
began
to
anoint
his
fingers
with
henna
then
they
tied
each
reddened
finger
with
a
small
handkerchief
he
smiled
widely
and
signaled
a
eunuch
to
bring
him
a
ball
of
opium
next
the
women
proceeded
to
zainul
beg
and
reddened
his
fingers
also
then
nadir
sharif
then
all
the
other
family
members
finally
they
stopped
in
front
of
hawksworth
a
robust
woman
from
the
his
fingers
and
began
to
daub
them
with
henna
paste
it
was
thick
and
smelled
of
saffron
he
watched
helplessly
as
his
fingers
disappeared
into
the
red
after
which
they
too
were
swathed
in
the
small
kerchiefs
of
silk
and
gold
it
will
make
you
virile
too
inglish
this
is
a
great
omen
for
your
good
fortune
arangbar
observed
wryly
delighted
by
the
confused
look
on
hawksworth
face
the
women
disappeared
back
into
the
the
music
began
again
now
with
more
dancers
hawksworth
recognized
among
them
the
young
women
sangeeta
who
had
danced
kathak
for
arangbar
that
first
night
in
the
she
was
resplendent
and
her
face
announced
her
pride
in
being
selected
for
the
first
night
of
the
wedding
celebrations
after
she
had
finished
her
dance
the
veiled
women
again
emerged
from
the
carrying
a
large
silver
vessel
and
saluted
allaudin
he
was
brought
to
the
center
of
the
square
where
they
began
to
remove
the
red
bindings
on
his
hands
and
feet
his
hands
then
his
feet
were
bathed
in
rosewater
after
they
were
dried
he
was
taken
back
to
the
attired
in
yet
another
of
the
new
suits
of
clothes
given
to
him
by
the
bride
he
returned
to
the
general
cheers
of
the
assembled
guests
whose
hands
had
also
been
washed
while
he
was
gone
as
the
formal
ceremonies
drew
to
a
close
arangbar
produced
heavy
brocade
waist
sashes
for
all
the
male
guests
hawksworth
was
last
and
when
he
received
his
from
arangbar
hand
he
bowed
in
thanks
and
examined
it
quizzically
it
is
a
inglish
for
you
to
wear
tomorrow
night
at
the
wedding
arangbar
took
hawksworth
fingers
and
examined
them
for
a
moment
if
you
can
get
the
rest
of
the
henna
off
your
fingers
by
then
he
roared
with
delight
and
signaled
the
musicians
to
start
again
allaudin
was
escorted
from
the
square
by
a
number
of
young
men
in
foppish
cloaks
hawksworth
assumed
they
were
his
friends
and
then
as
midnight
approached
servants
appeared
with
the
evening
meal
while
the
men
drank
and
dined
sangeeta
entertained
them
with
more
kathak
dance
when
she
was
near
exhaustion
other
dancers
were
brought
out
and
the
music
and
dance
continued
undiminished
through
the
short
hours
remaining
before
dawn
only
when
the
eastern
sky
began
to
lighten
did
arangbar
rise
and
bid
the
guests
farewell
the
courtyard
cleared
in
moments
as
the
crowd
dispersed
hawksworth
watched
the
moghul
down
another
ball
of
opium
and
call
for
sangeeta
to
accompany
him
into
the
palace
she
was
escorted
by
the
eunuchs
her
smile
brighter
than
the
rising
sun
hawksworth
was
momentarily
startled
as
a
fanfare
of
trumpets
announced
to
the
guests
in
zainul
beg
hall
that
arangbar
was
approaching
the
center
of
the
hall
cleared
leaving
a
pathway
from
the
entrance
to
a
low
platform
at
the
opposite
end
on
which
were
two
large
cushions
fashioned
from
gold
cloth
on
some
unseen
command
musicians
in
an
adjacent
room
began
to
play
and
then
the
doors
of
the
hall
opened
wide
women
from
arangbar
first
sweeping
past
the
guests
in
a
glitter
of
silks
and
jewels
unlike
anything
hawksworth
had
ever
seen
the
women
displayed
heavy
gold
necklaces
and
multiple
strands
of
pearls
their
arms
were
scarcely
visible
beneath
their
wide
gold
bracelets
for
this
evening
all
wore
a
headdress
of
silver
cloth
and
a
veil
more
trumpets
sounded
as
arangbar
himself
entered
queen
janahara
striding
imperiously
behind
him
hawksworth
examined
her
hard
features
with
curiosity
for
a
moment
before
the
significance
of
the
scene
registered
she
was
not
wearing
a
veil
he
looked
about
him
and
realized
that
the
other
guests
had
noticed
as
well
nadir
sharif
trailed
behind
the
royal
couple
and
after
him
came
a
few
select
officials
of
the
court
including
the
would
perform
the
ceremony
and
officially
record
the
marriage
as
arangbar
and
janahara
seated
themselves
on
the
cushioned
platform
the
guests
all
performed
the
arangbar
motioned
for
the
crowd
to
be
seated
and
hawksworth
was
already
halfway
to
the
carpet
before
he
noticed
that
no
one
else
had
moved
only
after
arangbar
had
demanded
three
times
that
the
guests
seat
themselves
did
those
around
hawksworth
accede
to
his
request
more
trays
of
rolled
betel
leaves
and
circulated
and
the
guests
settled
to
listen
to
a
lively
raga
performed
on
sitar
and
tabla
drums
by
musicians
who
were
seated
on
a
small
dais
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
hall
the
time
was
approaching
eight
when
the
musicians
brought
the
music
to
a
rousing
finish
hawksworth
found
himself
beginning
to
wonder
where
the
bride
and
groom
were
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
no
sooner
had
the
last
notes
of
the
raga
melted
into
the
tapestried
walls
than
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
closed
doors
of
the
hall
there
were
sounds
of
a
raucous
but
not
rancorous
argument
everyone
around
hawksworth
fell
silent
to
listen
there
were
more
words
and
he
managed
to
grasp
that
the
family
of
the
bride
was
demanding
a
payment
for
entry
apparently
a
mock
ritual
finally
there
was
the
jingle
of
coins
dropping
into
a
cup
the
money
seemed
to
settle
the
dispute
for
the
doors
of
the
hall
suddenly
burst
open
to
the
sounds
of
a
trumpet
fanfare
hawksworth
looked
through
the
doorway
to
see
a
horse
and
rider
surrounded
by
a
milling
crowd
in
the
lamplight
he
could
see
the
horse
was
covered
with
a
fine
brocade
tapestry
into
which
fresh
flowers
had
been
woven
its
legs
tail
and
mane
had
been
dyed
red
with
henna
and
all
its
body
outside
the
tapestry
was
covered
with
glistening
spangles
the
rider
cloak
and
turban
were
heavy
with
gold
thread
and
his
face
was
hidden
behind
a
thick
veil
of
silver
cloth
attached
to
the
top
of
this
turban
and
hanging
to
his
waist
on
either
side
of
the
horse
two
young
men
stood
each
carrying
a
large
paper
umbrella
which
they
held
over
the
head
behind
them
clustered
singers
dancers
musicians
and
a
mob
of
tipsy
young
men
in
extravagant
finery
the
crowd
cheered
the
veiled
rider
and
he
saluted
them
from
the
chatter
of
the
guests
hawksworth
gathered
that
the
horse
had
led
a
procession
through
the
streets
of
agra
for
the
past
two
hours
in
preparation
for
this
grand
entrance
the
rider
whom
hawksworth
assumed
to
be
prince
allaudin
was
helped
onto
the
back
of
one
of
the
young
men
he
was
then
carried
to
the
dais
where
arangbar
and
janahara
sat
and
gently
lowered
to
the
ground
the
silver
veil
was
removed
and
he
performed
the
the
fatigue
in
his
face
beginning
to
show
arangbar
beckoned
him
to
rise
and
two
eunuchs
who
had
been
part
of
the
moghul
train
stepped
forward
and
placed
two
large
silver
boxes
beside
him
on
the
dais
arangbar
opened
the
first
and
drew
out
a
string
of
large
pearls
he
admired
them
for
a
moment
showed
them
to
janahara
then
looped
them
around
allaudin
neck
next
he
opened
the
other
box
and
drew
out
a
crown
of
silver
trimmed
in
gold
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
held
it
aloft
two
months
past
i
presented
a
a
marriage
present
of
two
silver
rupees
to
honor
the
bride
and
tonight
i
bestow
on
my
son
the
same
the
same
bridegroom
crown
that
was
placed
on
my
head
the
night
i
wed
her
majesty
queen
janahara
allaudin
slipped
off
his
turban
and
knelt
before
arangbar
after
the
crown
was
fitted
he
stood
erect
to
acknowledge
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
without
further
ceremony
arangbar
turned
and
spoke
to
zainul
beg
the
old
two
eunuchs
forward
and
passed
an
order
there
were
shouts
and
torches
were
lighted
in
the
upper
balcony
of
the
hall
then
as
hawksworth
watched
in
amazement
the
tapestries
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
were
drawn
away
opening
the
pavilion
to
the
riverfront
arangbar
and
janahara
revolved
on
their
cushions
to
face
the
water
which
was
now
a
sea
of
floating
candles
and
lamps
the
guests
surged
forward
toward
the
opening
and
as
hawksworth
passed
near
the
royal
dais
arangbar
voice
cut
through
the
din
inglish
come
and
join
us
there
will
be
no
henna
on
your
fingers
tonight
he
gestured
toward
the
carpet
near
his
feet
sit
here
i
would
have
your
opinion
of
this
thank
you
your
majesty
hawksworth
sensed
that
arangbar
was
already
partly
drunk
what
will
happen
now
just
more
tradition
inglish
but
the
part
i
always
enjoy
most
he
pointed
toward
the
river
where
servants
were
carrying
torches
in
the
direction
of
three
decorated
wheels
each
several
feet
across
mounted
atop
what
appeared
to
be
cannon
tell
me
if
your
king
has
anything
to
equal
this
as
he
spoke
the
servants
touched
the
torches
to
the
center
of
each
wheel
lines
of
burning
sulfur
traced
their
spokes
then
ignited
the
squibs
attached
around
their
perimeter
at
that
instant
other
servants
stepped
forward
and
thrust
a
burning
taper
to
the
touchhole
of
each
cannon
the
cannon
spewed
flame
lofting
the
wheels
upward
over
the
river
they
suddenly
began
to
rotate
creating
a
whirling
circle
of
colored
flame
tips
in
the
night
sky
just
as
they
reached
the
top
of
their
trajectory
they
began
to
explode
one
by
one
showering
sparks
and
fire
across
the
face
of
the
jamuna
the
turbaned
crowd
scarcely
had
time
to
exclaim
its
delight
before
a
blue
flame
suddenly
appeared
from
behind
where
the
wheels
had
been
illuminating
the
palace
walls
in
a
shimmering
ghostly
light
as
it
grew
hawksworth
realized
it
was
an
artificial
tree
whose
branches
were
saturated
with
black
powder
and
brimstone
next
more
flames
spewed
from
the
tops
of
five
towers
that
had
been
erected
near
the
riverfront
there
were
sharp
reports
as
though
a
musket
had
been
fired
and
dense
streaks
of
red
billowed
into
the
sky
all
around
powder
pots
began
to
explode
hurtling
lightning
dazzling
white
with
camphor
and
writhing
serpents
of
flame
into
the
smoky
night
air
well
inglish
what
do
you
think
arangbar
turned
to
hawksworth
with
a
delighted
smile
have
you
ever
seen
anything
to
compare
we
have
fireworks
in
england
too
your
majesty
particularly
on
the
eve
of
john
day
when
we
have
barges
of
fireworks
on
the
thames
and
sometimes
they
used
in
plays
and
pageants
and
at
the
wedding
of
his
majesty
daughter
four
of
king
james
gunners
gave
a
show
with
a
fiery
castle
a
dragon
a
damsel
and
george
but
english
fireworks
generally
make
more
noise
than
these
hawksworth
paused
wondering
how
much
to
tell
and
some
countries
in
europe
use
fireworks
in
battle
majesty
helmets
that
throw
fire
swords
and
lances
with
fiery
points
and
bucklers
that
give
out
flames
when
struck
arangbar
gave
him
a
puzzled
glance
but
what
good
are
those
inglish
in
battle
the
most
important
use
of
flame
is
the
fire
lance
what
use
are
sparking
swords
watch
and
you
will
see
what
i
mean
arangbar
pointed
to
a
line
of
rajput
marksmen
carrying
horn
bows
and
heavy
spears
who
had
assembled
at
one
side
of
the
clearing
while
they
fell
into
a
formation
perpendicular
to
the
river
servants
were
placing
clay
pots
on
small
stands
at
the
opposite
side
perhaps
seventy
yards
away
the
rajputs
watched
impassively
as
the
arrows
in
their
bows
were
lighted
and
then
on
the
shout
of
their
commander
they
lifted
their
bows
and
fired
in
unison
ten
streaks
of
flame
shot
across
the
riverfront
and
the
crowd
fell
expectantly
silent
all
the
arrows
seemed
to
reach
their
target
at
precisely
the
same
instant
each
had
been
aimed
at
a
separate
pot
and
as
they
impacted
the
silence
was
rent
by
what
sounded
like
a
single
explosion
the
pots
hawksworth
realized
had
been
primed
with
powder
ready
to
detonate
the
smoke
was
still
drifting
across
the
grounds
when
torch
carriers
with
large
flambeaux
moved
to
the
center
illuminating
scaffolding
that
had
been
hastily
erected
more
clay
pots
painted
white
hung
suspended
from
the
scaffolds
on
long
ropes
the
servants
set
the
pots
swinging
and
then
fell
back
while
the
rajputs
ignited
the
tips
of
their
spears
again
flame
streaked
across
the
clearing
and
again
there
was
a
simultaneous
explosion
as
the
spears
caught
the
swinging
pots
arangbar
joined
the
cheers
then
turned
and
slapped
hawksworth
on
the
shoulder
that
inglish
is
how
you
use
fire
in
battle
you
must
put
it
where
you
want
it
no
soldier
of
india
would
be
daunted
by
trick
swords
and
bucklers
my
king
agrees
with
you
majesty
he
leaves
such
toys
to
the
germans
the
display
continued
for
almost
an
hour
as
one
exotic
device
after
another
was
carried
next
to
the
riverfront
the
water
became
littered
with
burning
paper
and
the
air
so
dense
with
smoke
that
queen
janahara
finally
started
to
cough
arangbar
immediately
ordered
an
end
to
the
fireworks
and
as
the
crowd
filed
back
into
the
hall
the
tapestries
were
lowered
to
again
conceal
the
smoky
view
of
the
river
now
the
music
began
and
the
dancing
as
musicians
and
women
moved
to
the
center
of
the
hall
servants
circulated
with
more
betel
leaves
and
and
arangbar
took
his
first
ball
of
opium
hawksworth
glanced
guardedly
at
the
queen
her
manner
was
imperious
regal
everything
a
sovereign
should
be
everything
allaudin
was
not
and
he
thought
probably
a
lot
arangbar
himself
is
not
she
soon
have
india
by
the
not
a
doubt
on
it
and
then
it
farewell
jadar
and
probably
farewell
arangbar
too
will
i
get
a
signed
trade
before
it
too
late
as
midnight
neared
the
music
and
dance
were
suddenly
interrupted
by
trumpets
and
a
drum
roll
and
shouts
of
the
bride
comes
the
curtains
covering
a
large
doorway
leading
into
the
palace
were
drawn
open
and
a
closed
palanquin
was
brought
in
by
four
eunuchs
it
was
accompanied
by
veiled
women
singing
something
hawksworth
did
not
understand
the
palanquin
was
carried
to
the
center
of
the
room
where
a
low
platform
covered
with
gold
brocade
had
been
positioned
and
then
the
eunuchs
lowered
it
to
the
marble
floor
the
curtains
were
drawn
aside
and
a
veiled
woman
emerged
her
small
body
almost
smothered
in
a
dress
that
seemed
made
of
multiple
layers
of
beaten
gold
she
was
helped
to
the
middle
of
the
platform
still
wearing
a
veil
that
covered
her
entire
face
chants
of
hail
to
the
bride
arose
on
all
sides
then
allaudin
was
escorted
forward
taking
his
place
on
the
platform
beside
her
he
stole
a
quick
distasteful
glance
at
the
veiled
figure
beside
him
then
an
official
smile
illuminated
his
face
and
he
sat
patiently
as
the
summoned
in
front
of
them
the
official
was
bearded
faced
and
transparently
arrogant
he
stood
before
the
veiled
bride
and
motioned
around
him
for
silence
is
it
by
your
own
consent
that
this
marriage
take
place
with
prince
allaudin
son
of
his
royal
majesty
from
beneath
the
layers
of
the
veil
came
a
muffled
almost
hesitant
it
is
by
my
consent
the
satisfied
and
began
reading
a
passage
from
the
quran
informing
her
that
marriage
depends
on
three
circumstances
the
assent
of
the
bride
and
groom
the
evidence
of
two
witnesses
and
the
marriage
settlement
he
then
turned
to
allaudin
and
asked
him
to
name
the
sum
he
brought
allaudin
mumbled
a
figure
that
hawksworth
did
not
catch
but
then
the
it
for
the
guests
hawksworth
caught
his
breath
when
he
realized
the
amount
named
was
fifty
rupees
then
allaudin
said
something
else
which
the
not
repeat
later
hawksworth
learned
that
allaudin
had
added
he
was
giving
only
ten
lakhs
of
rupees
then
and
the
balance
at
some
indefinite
future
time
the
the
royal
pair
praying
that
they
would
be
blissful
in
this
world
and
in
eternity
and
then
wrote
something
quickly
in
a
book
he
carried
finally
the
eunuchs
appeared
again
and
assisted
the
bride
into
the
palanquin
the
marriage
ceremony
seemed
to
be
over
a
glass
of
wine
was
placed
in
hawksworth
hand
and
he
looked
up
to
see
arangbar
beaming
with
satisfaction
now
we
drink
inglish
come
sit
closer
and
help
me
toast
the
bridegroom
it
was
truly
a
royal
wedding
your
majesty
but
it
not
over
inglish
arangbar
roared
with
laughter
the
hardest
part
is
yet
to
come
does
my
son
have
the
strength
to
complete
the
work
he
offered
to
undertake
no
one
can
leave
until
we
sure
hawksworth
had
begun
his
third
glass
of
wine
when
princess
layla
reappeared
wearing
a
lighter
dress
though
still
resplendent
behind
her
eunuchs
carried
several
palanquins
piled
high
with
vessels
and
trays
of
silver
following
them
were
servants
bearing
bundles
on
their
heads
those
are
the
wares
she
brings
to
the
marriage
inglish
and
her
servants
i
think
she
will
make
him
a
good
wife
the
royal
pair
moved
together
layla
still
veiled
and
then
queen
janahara
stepped
down
from
the
dais
and
took
a
large
mirror
handed
her
by
a
turbaned
eunuch
she
walked
to
the
couple
and
stopped
directly
in
front
of
them
as
they
stood
facing
her
she
held
the
mirror
before
allaudin
and
reached
to
lift
layla
veil
giving
him
his
first
glimpse
of
his
bride
hawksworth
studied
her
with
curiosity
she
was
plain
and
she
looked
very
frightened
it
auspicious
inglish
if
his
first
sight
of
his
bride
is
in
a
mirror
i
have
not
seen
her
before
either
arangbar
examined
her
for
a
moment
then
turned
to
nadir
sharif
what
do
you
think
should
i
buy
him
another
one
for
his
bed
she
a
goddess
of
beauty
majesty
inspiration
for
a
poet
is
that
what
you
think
arangbar
sipped
pensively
from
his
cup
well
perhaps
it
true
we
discover
soon
enough
if
she
inspires
her
groom
the
guests
watched
as
allaudin
and
layla
were
helped
into
a
large
palanquin
in
moments
their
procession
was
winding
out
of
the
palace
followed
by
layla
household
silver
to
a
great
fanfare
of
drums
and
trumpets
and
the
shouts
of
servants
peace
on
the
prophet
there
is
no
nobility
but
the
nobility
of
mohammed
allah
be
with
him
the
noblest
the
purest
the
highest
hawksworth
settled
back
against
his
bolster
and
realized
groggily
that
it
was
already
past
two
in
the
morning
when
the
wedding
procession
had
disappeared
from
view
the
jubilant
servants
immediately
turned
to
preparations
for
the
banquet
sometimes
life
can
be
sweet
inglish
arangbar
leaned
back
against
a
bolster
and
pinched
janahara
hand
i
think
he
should
have
more
wives
you
know
there
a
saying
in
india
man
should
have
four
wives
a
persian
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
a
khurasani
to
keep
his
house
a
hindu
from
the
south
to
nurse
his
children
and
a
bengali
to
whip
as
a
warning
to
the
other
three
so
far
he
has
only
the
persian
hawksworth
noticed
that
janahara
did
not
join
in
the
general
laughter
then
arangbar
took
another
drink
and
turned
to
hawksworth
but
you
know
i
do
entirely
agree
with
that
wisdom
inglish
the
holy
prophet
on
whom
be
peace
wisely
realized
a
man
needs
more
than
one
wife
he
also
demanded
of
us
that
we
give
each
of
them
equal
attention
never
to
turn
away
from
any
one
of
them
what
man
can
do
that
even
with
allah
help
it
is
never
possible
so
we
all
do
the
best
we
can
it
is
the
will
of
allah
arangbar
paused
to
swallow
a
ball
of
affion
as
he
watched
the
trays
of
lamb
being
placed
before
them
tell
me
inglish
have
you
found
a
wife
for
yourself
yet
not
as
yet
your
majesty
he
paused
there
are
so
many
to
choose
then
take
more
than
one
inglish
arangbar
washed
down
the
opium
it
not
allowed
for
a
christian
majesty
then
become
a
muslim
arangbar
smiled
and
took
another
sip
from
his
glass
are
you
circumcised
inglish
majesty
never
mind
arangbar
laughed
out
loud
neither
am
i
how
are
the
mullahs
to
know
my
father
akman
actually
wanted
to
start
his
own
religion
combining
the
wisdom
of
india
persia
and
the
west
he
thought
circumcision
was
an
absurd
practice
you
know
there
was
once
a
i
believe
he
was
portuguese
who
decided
to
become
a
muslim
a
true
believer
apparently
he
had
found
a
muslim
woman
he
wanted
to
marry
and
her
father
declared
she
could
never
marry
a
christian
so
he
had
himself
circumcised
arangbar
paused
dramatically
and
immediately
bled
to
death
but
doubtless
he
was
healed
by
the
time
he
reached
paradise
perhaps
he
made
up
there
for
what
he
missed
here
arangbar
chuckled
and
took
a
sip
of
wine
hawksworth
noticed
that
queen
janahara
was
trying
with
great
difficulty
to
retain
her
pleased
expression
do
you
believe
there
is
a
paradise
after
death
inglish
what
man
can
say
majesty
no
one
has
returned
from
death
to
tell
what
he
found
i
think
life
is
best
lived
in
the
present
i
always
believed
the
same
inglish
and
i
lived
as
few
men
on
allah
earth
have
lived
arangbar
settled
himself
against
his
bolster
and
reached
for
another
glass
he
was
starting
to
grow
visibly
tipsy
i
now
enjoy
all
allah
could
possibly
grant
to
a
living
man
there
is
nothing
on
earth
i
can
not
have
and
yet
do
you
know
i
still
have
many
griefs
show
me
the
man
whose
heart
is
free
of
grief
he
took
a
piece
of
lamb
from
a
dish
and
washed
it
down
so
i
find
my
greatest
happiness
with
wine
like
a
camel
driver
why
must
i
still
endure
sorrow
inglish
we
all
are
mortal
majesty
that
we
are
inglish
but
i
will
soon
see
this
paradise
if
it
exists
i
will
find
out
the
truth
soon
enough
and
when
i
finally
wise
who
will
then
come
after
me
now
my
sons
practically
war
among
themselves
someday
inglish
i
fear
they
may
decide
to
war
against
me
as
well
and
what
of
those
i
see
around
me
do
they
think
i
am
blind
to
their
deceit
arangbar
leaned
farther
back
on
the
bolster
nadir
sharif
sat
listening
rolling
a
ball
of
lamb
between
his
fingers
sometimes
i
think
you
may
be
the
only
honest
man
left
in
india
inglish
you
are
the
only
one
who
has
ever
dared
refuse
to
it
is
only
with
the
greatest
forbearance
that
i
do
not
order
you
hanged
i
thank
your
majesty
hawksworth
took
a
decanter
and
poured
more
wine
into
arangbar
glass
before
replenishing
his
own
no
inglish
instead
you
should
thank
your
christian
god
if
he
listens
to
you
but
sometimes
i
wonder
i
heard
you
called
a
heretic
more
than
once
and
i
have
names
for
the
jesuits
your
majesty
would
you
care
to
hear
them
no
inglish
frankly
i
have
names
for
them
too
but
tell
me
what
am
i
to
do
to
find
peace
arangbar
lowered
his
voice
but
only
slightly
i
see
around
me
an
army
of
sycophants
dressed
as
men
whom
dare
i
trust
you
know
my
own
people
were
once
warriors
mongols
of
the
steppes
they
knew
that
the
only
ties
that
last
are
blood
and
that
why
this
wedding
cheers
me
it
is
blood
to
blood
arangbar
turned
and
again
touched
janahara
hand
her
face
was
expressionless
as
she
accepted
the
gesture
the
only
person
in
india
i
dare
trust
completely
is
my
own
queen
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
not
will
not
deceive
me
never
i
feel
it
is
true
as
i
feel
nothing
else
in
life
nothing
else
janahara
face
remained
a
mask
as
arangbar
drank
again
nadir
sharif
was
watching
wordlessly
his
face
beginning
to
turn
noticeably
grim
hawksworth
realized
he
had
not
been
mentioned
i
have
loved
her
since
i
was
a
youth
inglish
arangbar
continued
his
voice
growing
maudlin
and
she
has
never
betrayed
my
trust
the
reason
i
would
do
anything
she
asked
me
anything
anytime
i
always
know
it
is
right
hawksworth
found
himself
marveling
as
he
glanced
at
calculating
eyes
i
not
trust
her
with
two
pence
he
must
be
god
own
fool
arangbar
sat
silent
for
a
moment
savoring
his
own
pronouncement
then
he
turned
to
janahara
and
spoke
to
her
in
a
dull
slur
ask
something
of
me
let
me
prove
to
the
inglish
that
i
can
never
deny
you
janahara
turned
as
though
she
had
not
been
listening
hawksworth
knew
she
had
been
straining
for
every
word
what
could
i
ask
majesty
you
have
given
me
all
i
could
ever
want
tonight
you
even
gave
me
a
husband
for
my
daughter
now
i
can
die
with
the
peace
of
allah
but
i
must
give
you
something
he
settled
his
wine
cup
shakily
on
the
carpet
jostling
red
splashes
across
the
persian
design
you
must
name
it
but
there
is
nothing
i
could
ask
that
i
do
not
already
have
sometimes
you
vex
me
with
your
good
nature
the
inglish
will
now
suspect
the
moghul
of
india
is
a
vain
braggart
he
fumbled
with
his
turban
trying
to
detach
the
large
blue
sapphire
attached
to
the
front
i
will
give
you
a
jewel
even
though
you
have
not
asked
it
i
beg
your
majesty
she
reached
to
stay
his
hand
there
is
nothing
more
i
could
ever
want
but
i
must
give
you
something
she
smiled
in
defeat
if
you
must
bestow
a
present
why
not
give
something
to
the
bride
and
groom
this
is
their
wedding
not
mine
then
at
least
you
must
name
it
it
will
be
my
gift
to
you
through
them
he
turned
to
hawksworth
whatever
else
you
do
inglish
never
marry
a
persian
they
forever
study
to
try
your
patience
hawksworth
noticed
nadir
sharifs
eyes
harden
as
he
listened
he
slowly
gripped
the
side
of
his
bolster
and
absently
pulled
away
a
piece
of
gold
fringe
then
give
them
a
small
token
to
show
your
confidence
in
allaudin
i
asked
you
to
name
it
very
well
perhaps
you
could
grant
him
the
royal
dholpur
those
closest
to
agra
arangbar
sleepy
eyes
widened
slightly
those
go
to
the
prince
nearest
the
throne
i
granted
them
only
last
year
to
prince
jadar
as
part
of
his
price
to
undertake
the
campaign
in
the
deccan
but
prince
allaudin
can
administer
them
more
easily
he
here
and
you
can
compensate
jadar
with
others
perhaps
some
in
the
north
near
the
fortress
of
qandahar
you
have
to
send
him
there
after
the
campaign
in
the
deccan
janahara
voice
was
silken
now
hawksworth
turned
to
see
nadir
sharifs
face
growing
ashen
she
trying
to
drive
jadar
into
oblivion
rob
him
of
his
best
estates
then
send
him
to
defend
a
piece
of
mountain
rock
surely
arangbar
will
refuse
jadar
will
never
agree
she
must
know
that
nadir
sharif
certainly
knows
it
what
would
prince
jadar
say
to
such
a
trade
arangbar
sipped
from
his
wineglass
and
shifted
slightly
his
eyes
again
barely
in
focus
why
should
he
object
he
never
here
and
surely
he
be
ready
to
obey
your
majesty
and
return
to
defend
qandahar
after
he
completes
his
campaign
in
the
south
the
threat
from
the
persian
safavis
in
the
north
is
already
growing
i
doubt
very
much
he
will
agree
so
easily
to
march
north
again
not
yet
though
i
pray
to
allah
that
he
would
then
this
will
give
him
all
the
more
reason
he
may
not
see
it
as
a
reason
he
may
see
it
as
a
betrayal
you
know
he
temperamental
hawksworth
suddenly
found
himself
wondering
if
the
trade
had
been
planned
with
allaudin
it
was
obvious
nadir
sharif
had
been
taken
completely
by
surprise
then
i
suppose
it
best
dropped
janahara
turned
her
face
away
you
can
just
forget
i
ever
asked
arangbar
looked
crushed
he
sipped
thoughtfully
on
his
wine
for
a
moment
perhaps
if
i
consulted
prince
jadar
first
he
paused
to
study
his
empty
wine
cup
the
were
granted
perhaps
your
majesty
thinks
prince
allaudin
should
have
no
estates
at
all
perhaps
you
think
he
is
not
yet
fit
he
fit
by
allah
he
my
son
arangbar
impulsively
seized
another
ball
of
opium
and
began
to
chew
on
it
thoughtfully
i
find
a
way
to
compensate
jadar
surely
he
be
reasonable
after
all
there
must
be
a
wedding
gift
then
you
agree
to
grant
it
janahara
tone
was
quiet
and
inquiring
majesty
nadir
sharifs
voice
seemed
strangely
unguarded
prince
jadar
arangbar
seemed
not
to
hear
him
i
grant
it
in
the
morning
summon
the
and
let
this
be
recorded
as
my
gift
to
my
youngest
son
and
his
new
bride
arangbar
tenseness
seemed
to
dissolve
as
he
leaned
back
on
the
bolster
and
took
another
ball
of
opium
but
only
on
the
condition
that
he
perform
his
duty
tonight
let
him
plow
the
field
he
has
before
he
granted
more
arangbar
turned
to
hawksworth
do
you
know
what
else
will
happen
inglish
if
he
fails
in
his
duty
the
first
night
no
majesty
some
of
her
women
will
send
him
a
distaff
which
they
use
with
their
spinning
wheels
with
a
message
that
since
he
can
not
do
a
man
work
it
is
fitting
he
should
do
a
woman
but
i
think
he
succeed
arangbar
turned
to
janahara
with
a
wink
he
been
practicing
for
months
with
the
in
the
palace
the
queen
did
not
smile
as
she
took
a
rolled
betel
leaf
from
a
tray
a
messenger
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
and
performed
the
his
voice
was
quivering
the
sheet
has
not
yet
come
out
may
it
please
your
majesty
arangbar
laughed
then
perhaps
the
furrow
is
too
narrow
to
receive
his
plow
have
a
mullah
bless
some
water
and
send
it
in
to
him
and
tell
him
i
waiting
to
see
if
he
yet
a
man
a
mullah
your
majesty
or
a
sunni
from
this
night
forward
he
will
have
mullahs
perform
all
the
duties
for
his
household
janahara
interrupted
the
messenger
performed
the
the
queen
and
backed
from
the
room
arangbar
sat
silent
drinking
what
does
it
matter
he
finally
turned
to
her
let
him
have
whatever
he
pleases
that
is
easy
for
you
to
say
but
it
does
not
please
allah
tonight
should
be
taken
as
an
omen
tonight
is
an
omen
of
nothing
tonight
my
son
is
charged
to
make
a
woman
out
of
a
persian
girl
of
fifteen
who
knows
nothing
of
her
duties
in
bed
but
he
succeed
give
him
time
i
think
tonight
is
an
omen
allah
is
not
pleased
when
you
allow
open
heresies
to
flourish
arangbar
was
watching
a
dancer
who
had
approached
the
dais
to
begin
a
suggestive
for
him
it
seemed
to
hawksworth
that
they
were
already
well
acquainted
for
she
smiled
at
him
knowingly
avoiding
the
queen
glance
i
care
nothing
for
heresies
arangbar
turned
back
to
janahara
i
only
care
for
the
honor
of
my
reign
but
a
faith
divided
does
you
no
honor
then
unite
it
if
you
care
so
much
i
have
other
duties
arangbar
turned
again
to
watch
the
dancer
she
had
a
large
ring
in
one
side
of
her
nose
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
snap
as
she
slapped
her
bare
feet
against
the
carpeted
floor
i
never
knew
she
was
so
good
he
turned
to
nadir
sharif
send
her
a
small
ruby
and
find
out
for
me
tomorrow
what
her
salary
is
whatever
it
is
i
think
she
should
have
more
as
you
wish
majesty
nadir
sharif
bowed
lightly
and
turned
again
to
watch
the
dancer
hawksworth
studied
the
prime
minister
face
it
was
grim
leaden
it
everything
shirin
said
would
happen
prince
jadar
has
been
stripped
of
his
lands
and
the
queen
has
been
granted
license
to
start
an
inquisition
you
better
get
the
before
the
country
starts
coming
apart
the
doors
of
the
hall
burst
open
and
a
crowd
of
women
entered
they
carried
a
silver
plate
on
which
was
a
folded
silken
sheet
they
moved
quickly
before
the
queen
and
performed
the
then
one
held
out
the
plate
the
queen
took
the
sheet
and
inspected
it
hawksworth
watched
her
puzzling
then
remembered
that
in
muslim
society
a
bloodstained
wedding
sheet
is
considered
evidence
vital
to
the
honor
of
both
the
families
of
the
bride
virginity
and
the
groom
virility
with
a
triumphant
smile
janahara
nodded
and
turned
to
exhibit
the
sheet
to
arangbar
there
were
light
pink
traces
across
the
white
silk
he
a
man
after
all
arangbar
passed
the
sheet
to
zainul
beg
who
beamed
and
passed
it
to
nadir
sharif
the
prime
minister
smiled
with
approval
he
has
earned
his
arangbar
turned
to
janahara
let
it
be
recorded
and
now
we
feast
more
silver
dishes
of
baked
lamp
appeared
from
inside
the
palace
brought
by
eunuchs
who
inspected
them
carefully
before
handing
them
to
serving
women
the
music
and
dancing
were
exultant
now
and
lasted
until
the
light
of
dawn
showed
the
drunken
guests
waited
reverently
until
arangbar
who
had
gone
to
sleep
was
carried
from
the
hall
on
a
palanquin
then
they
began
to
disperse
hawksworth
reached
nadir
sharif
side
as
the
prime
minister
was
moving
out
through
the
large
doorway
what
really
happened
tonight
what
do
you
mean
ambassador
the
transfer
of
what
will
jadar
do
ambassador
that
a
matter
for
the
rulers
of
india
to
decide
not
your
affair
nadir
sharif
did
not
look
around
instead
let
me
ask
you
a
question
when
will
your
english
fleet
make
landfall
they
are
overdue
but
there
have
been
no
further
sightings
i
beginning
to
wonder
if
there
really
is
a
fleet
perhaps
the
weather
been
against
them
hawksworth
tried
to
steady
himself
on
his
feet
after
all
it
was
sighted
by
jadar
men
was
it
or
did
you
and
prince
jadar
deceive
us
all
if
there
no
fleet
ambassador
you
in
very
serious
trouble
there
will
be
no
his
majesty
is
hardly
a
fool
he
promised
to
sign
the
before
the
sighting
you
do
not
know
him
as
i
do
you
have
another
week
perhaps
two
and
then
let
me
merely
say
you
can
not
drink
the
fleet
into
existence
we
are
both
going
to
have
difficulty
explaining
this
deception
to
his
majesty
you
met
with
the
prince
i
beginning
to
wonder
now
if
you
both
planned
this
if
you
did
it
was
most
unwise
then
wait
two
weeks
and
see
hawksworth
felt
his
palms
grow
moist
two
weeks
is
not
so
long
a
time
it
is
a
very
long
time
ambassador
much
is
happening
you
have
made
many
of
the
wrong
friends
good
evening
ambassador
i
must
speak
to
her
majesty
nadir
sharif
turned
and
was
swallowed
by
the
crowd
as
hawksworth
moved
into
the
street
he
saw
that
the
front
of
the
palace
was
already
bathed
in
morning
light
and
agra
was
beginning
to
come
to
life
he
strolled
for
a
time
along
the
side
of
the
jamuna
where
candles
still
floated
and
studied
the
outline
of
the
red
fort
against
the
morning
sky
what
if
there
really
is
no
fleet
what
if
it
really
was
a
trick
by
jadar
for
some
reason
of
his
own
to
destroy
my
mission
has
he
cozened
us
all
midmorning
was
approaching
when
he
finally
reached
his
lodge
at
the
rear
of
nadir
sharifs
estate
as
he
passed
through
the
curtained
doorway
he
saw
kamala
waiting
her
eyes
dark
she
was
wearing
none
of
her
jewels
have
you
heard
she
took
his
turban
and
knelt
to
remove
his
heard
what
do
you
know
the
sufi
samad
and
the
persian
woman
who
was
with
him
hawksworth
examined
her
wondering
who
else
knew
of
his
stay
in
fatehpur
sekri
why
do
you
ask
if
you
do
know
them
it
is
no
longer
wise
to
admit
it
why
hawksworth
felt
his
gut
tighten
suddenly
kamala
touch
no
longer
stirred
him
the
news
is
already
spreading
in
agra
she
began
removing
his
cloak
pausing
to
smooth
her
hand
across
his
chest
they
were
arrested
last
night
while
the
wedding
was
underway
in
the
bazaar
this
morning
they
say
he
is
sure
to
be
condemned
to
death
for
heresy
and
she
for
aiding
him
people
think
they
will
both
be
executed
within
the
week
chapter
father
manoel
pinheiro
face
was
grim
and
his
lips
set
tightly
against
the
brisk
air
as
he
pushed
a
path
through
the
crowded
alley
headed
toward
the
riverside
palace
of
nadir
sharif
around
him
large
black
cauldrons
of
frying
bread
filled
the
dawn
with
the
aroma
of
oil
and
spice
he
had
slipped
from
the
mission
house
at
first
light
and
clasping
his
peaked
black
hat
tightly
over
his
forehead
he
had
tried
to
melt
inconspicuously
among
the
rattling
bullock
carts
and
noisy
street
vendors
now
he
paused
for
breath
and
watched
as
a
large
white
cow
licked
the
few
grains
of
rice
from
the
begging
bowl
of
a
dozing
leper
the
image
seemed
to
capture
all
the
despair
of
india
and
he
suddenly
felt
himself
overwhelmed
by
the
enormity
of
the
burden
before
he
could
move
on
a
crowd
of
chanting
hindus
jostled
him
against
a
wall
as
they
poured
into
a
small
garishly
decorated
temple
brimming
with
heathen
idols
on
either
side
hindu
fakirs
sat
listlessly
long
white
hair
streaming
down
over
their
streaked
faces
their
limpid
eyes
devoid
of
god
understanding
he
shook
his
head
sadly
as
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
them
and
found
his
heart
near
bursting
on
every
hand
he
told
himself
the
fields
are
ripe
unto
harvest
the
flocks
wanting
a
keeper
for
every
soul
in
this
forgotten
land
we
bring
to
god
and
the
church
a
hundred
nay
a
thousand
are
born
into
eternal
darkness
damned
forever
our
task
is
overwhelming
even
with
help
he
thought
of
the
holy
church
the
society
of
jesus
and
their
long
years
of
disappointment
in
india
but
now
at
last
it
seemed
their
hopes
and
prayers
might
be
nearing
fulfillment
after
all
the
years
of
humiliation
and
ignominy
there
seemed
a
chance
a
genuine
chance
that
arangbar
the
great
moghul
himself
would
at
last
consent
to
be
baptized
into
the
holy
church
after
him
all
of
india
would
surely
soon
follow
father
pinheiro
crossed
himself
again
and
prayed
silently
that
god
would
make
him
a
worthy
instrument
of
his
will
the
burden
of
india
was
by
now
a
jesuit
legend
it
had
been
taken
up
when
the
first
mission
came
to
the
court
of
akman
over
three
decades
before
and
even
now
the
pagan
fields
of
india
remained
in
many
ways
the
greatest
challenge
of
the
society
of
jesus
and
the
holy
church
india
had
it
was
true
been
held
in
the
grip
of
portuguese
sea
power
for
many
years
before
the
first
mission
arrived
in
agra
but
portuguese
arms
and
trade
had
not
served
the
work
of
the
church
they
had
served
the
greed
of
portuguese
merchants
and
the
coffers
of
portuguese
royalty
the
lost
souls
of
india
were
denied
the
grace
of
the
holy
church
then
in
a
priest
named
ignatius
loyola
once
a
nobleman
and
a
soldier
founded
the
society
of
jesus
whose
dual
purpose
was
to
defend
the
holy
church
against
the
protestant
reformation
and
begin
preaching
the
true
faith
to
the
pagan
lands
of
asia
and
the
americas
in
the
society
of
jesus
reached
portuguese
goa
on
the
very
shores
of
india
in
the
person
of
francis
xavier
a
close
friend
of
ignatius
loyola
from
student
days
at
the
university
of
paris
with
goa
as
base
of
operations
the
society
had
immediately
pushed
farther
eastward
reaching
japan
and
macao
a
few
short
years
later
paradoxically
it
was
india
itself
that
had
initially
eluded
their
influence
finally
in
the
great
akman
journeyed
south
and
encountered
the
members
of
the
society
of
jesus
for
the
first
time
he
was
awed
by
their
learning
and
moral
integrity
and
soon
thereafter
he
posted
an
envoy
to
goa
requesting
that
a
jesuit
mission
be
sent
to
his
court
three
jesuit
fathers
traveled
to
fatehpur
sekri
the
jesuits
hopes
soared
when
they
were
immediately
invited
to
debate
the
orthodox
islamic
mullahs
at
akman
court
the
leader
of
the
mission
a
italian
father
with
encyclopedic
learning
knew
the
quran
well
in
translation
and
easily
refuted
the
absolutist
arguments
to
the
obvious
delight
of
akman
it
was
only
after
several
months
at
fatehpur
sekri
that
the
three
learned
fathers
began
to
suspect
that
akman
real
purpose
in
inviting
them
was
to
have
on
hand
skilled
debaters
for
entertainment
akman
may
have
had
scant
patience
with
islam
but
it
had
grown
obvious
he
had
no
desire
to
become
a
christian
either
he
was
an
intellectual
who
amused
himself
by
questioning
the
ideas
and
teachings
of
all
faiths
with
the
inevitable
result
that
he
always
found
something
in
each
to
affront
his
own
reason
he
was
in
fact
beginning
to
form
the
notion
that
he
himself
was
as
great
a
leader
as
any
of
the
spiritual
teachers
he
had
heard
about
and
accordingly
should
simply
declare
himself
an
object
of
worship
after
a
decade
the
three
jesuits
finally
conceded
their
first
mission
was
a
failure
and
abjectly
returned
to
goa
almost
a
decade
later
in
akman
again
requested
that
jesuit
fathers
be
sent
to
his
court
once
more
a
mission
was
sent
and
once
more
its
members
eventually
concluded
akman
had
no
real
intention
of
encouraging
christianity
in
india
the
second
mission
was
also
abandoned
there
remained
some
however
in
goa
and
in
rome
who
believed
the
great
moghul
akman
still
could
be
converted
furthermore
as
the
protestant
countries
began
to
venture
into
the
indies
the
political
usefulness
of
having
portuguese
priests
near
the
ruler
of
india
became
increasingly
obvious
thus
in
a
third
mission
was
sent
to
akman
court
father
pinheiro
remembered
well
their
instructions
upon
departing
goa
they
would
convert
akman
if
they
could
but
equally
important
now
they
would
ensure
that
portuguese
trading
interests
were
protected
the
jesuit
fathers
drew
close
to
akman
became
valued
advisers
and
found
themselves
being
consulted
on
questions
ranging
from
whether
jesus
was
the
son
of
god
or
merely
a
prophet
to
the
advisability
of
smoking
tobacco
still
the
only
lasting
achievement
of
the
mission
was
to
extract
from
akman
a
jesuits
the
right
to
free
exercise
of
the
catholic
religion
they
wanted
his
soul
and
through
it
the
soul
of
india
but
the
most
they
ever
attained
was
his
protection
he
died
a
royal
skeptic
but
a
sovereign
whose
religious
tolerance
shocked
the
dogmatic
world
father
pinheiro
paused
to
study
the
outline
of
the
red
fort
against
the
morning
sky
and
listened
to
the
to
islamic
prayer
sounding
from
a
nearby
mosque
he
smiled
to
think
that
the
schism
between
the
rule
of
arangbar
and
the
rule
of
islam
might
soon
be
complete
like
akman
arangbar
had
never
bothered
to
hide
his
distaste
for
the
mullahs
who
flooded
his
court
he
collected
italian
paintings
of
the
virgin
for
his
palace
even
scandalizing
the
mullahs
by
hanging
one
in
the
and
whenever
one
of
the
jesuit
fathers
journeyed
to
goa
there
was
always
a
request
for
more
christian
art
true
the
understanding
of
blasphemy
was
erratic
as
evidenced
by
a
recent
evening
in
the
drunk
and
roaring
with
laughter
arangbar
had
set
a
wager
with
the
jesuits
on
how
long
he
could
stand
with
his
arms
outstretched
as
a
cross
but
then
he
had
built
a
church
for
the
mission
and
also
provided
them
a
house
which
he
now
visited
ever
more
frequently
to
secretly
indulge
his
passion
for
forbidden
pork
a
scant
two
months
before
arangbar
had
taken
an
action
that
sent
the
mission
hopes
soaring
he
had
summoned
the
jesuit
fathers
to
baptize
two
of
his
young
nephews
ordering
the
boys
to
become
christians
the
mullahs
had
been
outraged
immediately
spreading
the
pernicious
rumor
he
had
done
so
merely
to
better
remove
them
from
the
line
of
succession
in
goa
however
the
mission
was
roundly
congratulated
on
nearing
its
goal
if
arangbar
became
a
christian
many
in
his
court
and
perhaps
eventually
all
of
india
would
someday
follow
this
had
all
been
before
the
arrival
of
the
english
heretic
hawksworth
at
the
very
moment
when
arangbar
mind
seemed
within
their
grasp
there
had
now
emerged
the
specter
that
all
their
work
might
be
undone
arangbar
had
treated
the
englishman
as
though
he
were
qualified
to
speak
on
theological
matters
and
had
even
questioned
him
about
the
most
holy
sacrament
when
the
church
doctrine
regarding
this
mystery
had
already
been
fully
expounded
to
him
by
father
sarmento
himself
arangbar
had
listened
with
seeming
interest
while
the
englishman
proceeded
to
tell
him
much
that
was
contrary
to
the
truth
and
to
church
teaching
when
asked
point
blank
the
englishman
had
even
denied
that
his
holiness
the
pope
should
be
acknowledged
head
of
the
universal
church
going
on
to
characterize
his
holiness
political
concerns
in
almost
scatological
terms
father
sarmento
normally
the
most
forbearing
of
priests
was
nearing
despair
most
disturbing
of
all
arangbar
had
only
last
week
asked
the
englishman
by
what
means
the
portuguese
fortress
at
the
northern
port
of
diu
could
be
recaptured
by
india
the
englishman
had
confided
that
he
believed
a
blockade
by
a
dozen
english
frigates
supported
by
an
indian
land
army
of
no
more
than
twenty
thousand
could
force
the
portuguese
garrison
to
capitulate
from
hunger
clearly
arangbar
was
growing
eccentric
the
english
heretic
had
beguiled
him
and
was
near
to
becoming
a
serious
detriment
to
portuguese
interests
to
make
matters
worse
there
was
the
latest
dispatch
from
goa
which
had
arrived
only
the
previous
evening
father
pinheiro
had
studied
it
well
into
the
night
and
finally
concluded
that
the
time
had
come
to
stop
the
englishman
he
also
concluded
it
was
time
to
make
this
unmistakably
clear
to
nadir
sharif
as
the
situation
continued
to
deteriorate
only
the
influence
of
nadir
sharif
could
still
neutralize
the
englishman
father
pinheiro
moved
on
through
the
jostling
street
occasionally
swabbing
his
brow
and
as
he
looked
about
him
he
began
to
dream
of
the
day
there
would
be
a
christian
india
it
would
be
the
greatest
triumph
what
would
it
be
like
what
would
arangbar
do
to
silence
the
heretical
mullahs
would
the
time
come
when
india
like
europe
would
require
an
inquisition
to
purify
the
sovereignty
of
the
church
one
thing
was
certain
with
a
catholic
monarch
in
india
there
would
be
no
further
english
trade
no
dutch
trade
no
protestant
trade
the
declining
fortunes
of
portuguese
commerce
at
goa
the
protestant
challenge
to
portuguese
supremacy
in
the
indies
would
both
be
permanently
reversed
in
a
single
stroke
the
thought
heartened
him
as
he
looked
up
to
see
the
sandstone
turrets
of
nadir
sharif
palace
gleaming
in
the
morning
sun
father
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
see
you
nadir
sharif
bowed
lightly
and
indicated
a
bolster
he
did
not
order
refreshments
from
the
servants
no
matter
what
the
hour
i
realize
the
time
is
early
i
wanted
to
find
you
at
home
and
to
come
here
when
there
were
the
fewest
possible
eyes
on
the
street
pinheiro
paused
and
then
decided
to
sit
he
was
perspiring
heavily
from
the
walk
even
though
the
real
heat
of
the
day
lay
hours
ahead
nadir
sharif
flinched
at
the
jesuit
persian
and
examined
him
with
disdain
knowing
word
of
his
visit
surely
had
already
found
the
ears
of
the
queen
then
i
should
ask
the
occasion
for
this
unexpected
pleasure
nadir
sharif
seated
himself
and
discreetly
examined
the
jesuit
soiled
black
habit
the
english
trading
fleet
excellency
the
news
is
most
disturbing
i
received
a
pigeon
last
evening
from
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
the
armada
he
dispatched
along
the
coast
to
sweep
for
the
english
fleet
returned
three
days
ago
finding
nothing
the
english
may
have
eluded
us
he
has
now
ordered
the
armada
to
sail
north
from
goa
into
the
bay
but
by
now
the
english
fleet
could
be
nearing
surat
or
perhaps
they
have
veered
north
to
the
port
of
cambay
his
excellency
fears
that
they
may
possibly
escape
our
patrols
entirely
and
make
landfall
he
has
asked
me
to
inform
you
privately
that
the
english
trade
must
be
delayed
at
all
costs
until
the
english
fleet
can
be
sighted
and
engaged
i
have
made
every
effort
the
viceroy
knows
that
nadir
sharif
casually
adjusted
the
jewel
on
his
turban
it
has
been
stopped
so
far
but
if
the
fleet
lands
and
if
the
heretic
english
king
has
sent
new
gifts
for
his
majesty
pinheiro
tried
to
maintain
his
dignity
as
he
nervously
wiped
his
face
with
the
black
fold
of
a
sleeve
if
the
english
do
make
landfall
and
dispatch
more
gifts
for
his
majesty
i
fear
no
power
in
agra
can
stop
him
from
signing
the
nadir
sharifs
face
assumed
an
expression
of
conciliatory
resignation
the
english
will
undoubtedly
make
the
trading
a
condition
of
further
presents
you
know
that
is
unacceptable
excellency
pinheiro
eyes
narrowed
the
mission
can
not
allow
it
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
forgive
me
but
i
always
understood
your
mission
here
was
not
to
concern
itself
with
trade
the
holy
church
is
not
engaged
in
trade
excellency
but
our
position
here
is
dependent
as
you
are
well
aware
on
the
fortunes
of
goa
the
two
are
entwined
as
are
all
secular
and
spiritual
aspects
of
life
whatever
disturbs
one
must
inevitably
affect
the
other
it
can
not
be
otherwise
obviously
nadir
sharif
stroked
the
tip
of
his
moustache
a
moment
in
thought
so
what
would
you
have
me
do
the
english
be
harmed
he
drinks
every
evening
with
his
majesty
there
are
other
ways
to
negate
the
heretic
influence
perhaps
the
englishman
situation
with
his
majesty
can
be
rendered
less
intimate
perhaps
he
could
be
removed
from
favor
if
only
for
a
time
so
you
have
come
to
ask
me
to
work
miracles
for
you
when
you
do
nothing
for
yourself
nadir
sharif
rose
and
strolled
to
a
latticework
window
he
studied
the
garden
for
a
moment
then
spoke
without
turning
have
you
advised
his
majesty
in
explicit
terms
of
the
displeasure
with
the
english
intrusion
into
our
into
portuguese
waters
it
has
been
made
known
many
times
but
have
you
suggested
the
consequences
nadir
sharif
turned
and
gazed
past
pinheiro
his
eyes
playing
on
the
scalloped
marble
arch
of
the
entryway
the
consequences
are
obvious
the
warships
at
goa
are
capable
of
terminating
all
trade
in
the
indian
ocean
if
his
excellency
so
pleases
then
you
should
merely
engage
the
english
nadir
sharif
consciously
deleted
the
irony
from
his
voice
that
is
an
entirely
separate
matter
the
english
frigates
are
of
a
new
design
very
swift
they
may
possibly
have
eluded
us
for
a
time
pinheiro
voice
hardened
but
do
not
doubt
our
galleons
are
swifter
than
any
of
the
trading
vessels
of
his
majesty
fleet
india
own
red
sea
trade
continues
only
at
the
viceroy
discretion
that
is
true
enough
but
are
you
prepared
to
demonstrate
your
displeasure
nadir
sharif
revolved
back
to
the
window
i
do
not
think
his
majesty
actually
believes
the
viceroy
would
ever
take
hostile
action
what
are
you
suggesting
pinheiro
voice
betrayed
momentary
disbelief
nothing
that
you
have
not
already
brought
to
his
majesty
attention
but
possibly
he
does
not
believe
you
have
the
conviction
or
the
strength
to
carry
it
through
the
english
brags
to
him
of
english
superiority
at
sea
hinting
that
his
king
will
soon
drive
portugal
from
the
indian
ocean
i
heard
it
so
often
myself
i
confess
i
near
to
believing
him
too
i
can
assure
you
that
the
protection
and
control
of
india
ports
will
always
remain
in
portuguese
hands
then
you
would
still
have
me
believe
you
have
the
power
to
impound
indian
shipping
even
a
vessel
owned
by
his
majesty
thereby
exposing
the
english
as
helpless
to
prevent
it
nadir
sharif
seemed
absorbed
in
the
garden
his
hands
clasped
easily
behind
him
in
perfect
repose
of
course
pinheiro
stood
dazed
at
the
implications
of
nadir
sharifs
words
he
paused
for
a
moment
digesting
them
do
i
understand
you
to
be
suggesting
the
viceroy
take
hostile
action
against
one
of
his
majesty
own
trading
ships
you
have
contested
the
englishman
with
words
and
he
seems
to
be
winning
nadir
sharif
turned
and
examined
pinheiro
your
viceroy
is
undoubtedly
aware
that
her
majesty
queen
janahara
is
equally
disturbed
by
the
englishman
she
too
is
concerned
with
the
possible
effects
on
her
trading
arrangements
if
the
english
gain
undue
influence
would
she
be
willing
to
speak
to
his
majesty
again
you
talk
merely
of
words
what
have
they
gained
you
father
sarmento
would
never
consent
to
an
overt
action
he
would
be
too
fearful
of
the
possible
consequences
to
the
mission
bold
measures
are
for
bold
men
i
think
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
understands
boldness
and
his
majesty
understands
boldness
better
than
anyone
nadir
sharif
paused
it
may
be
of
interest
to
his
excellency
to
know
that
his
majesty
currently
has
a
vessel
en
route
from
the
red
sea
with
cargo
owned
by
the
mother
of
his
majesty
the
dowager
maryam
zamani
it
is
due
to
make
landfall
within
the
week
if
it
has
managed
to
hold
its
schedule
the
vessel
safety
is
quite
naturally
of
utmost
concern
to
his
majesty
i
think
i
understand
father
pinheiro
again
swabbed
the
moisture
from
his
brow
but
father
sarmento
what
possible
concern
could
father
sarmento
have
with
decisions
made
by
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
he
is
the
viceroy
nadir
sharif
nodded
toward
a
pudgy
eunuch
hovering
at
the
doorway
who
immediately
entered
with
a
tray
of
betel
leaves
signaling
that
the
meeting
was
adjourned
his
excellency
will
undoubtedly
be
most
appreciative
of
your
thoughts
pinheiro
paused
still
would
it
be
prudent
to
advise
her
majesty
lest
she
mistake
our
viceroy
intentions
i
will
attend
to
it
nadir
sharif
smiled
warmly
you
must
be
aware
however
that
if
his
majesty
chooses
to
respond
irresponsibly
i
will
know
nothing
about
any
action
that
may
be
taken
the
viceroy
must
weather
his
own
seas
naturally
pinheiro
bowed
you
have
always
been
a
friend
i
thank
you
and
bless
you
in
god
name
your
thanks
are
sufficient
nadir
sharif
smiled
again
and
watched
as
the
jesuit
was
led
through
the
scalloped
doorway
by
the
waiting
eunuch
only
when
he
turned
back
to
the
window
did
he
realize
his
palms
were
drenched
with
perspiration
arangbar
moved
groggily
through
the
arched
corridor
carrying
a
fresh
silver
cup
of
wine
and
quietly
humming
the
motif
of
his
favorite
hindustani
raga
his
afternoon
nap
in
the
been
fitful
unusually
so
and
when
he
finally
admitted
to
himself
why
he
had
dismissed
the
two
young
women
who
waited
to
pleasure
him
retrieved
his
jeweled
turban
and
waved
aside
the
attending
eunuchs
he
had
announced
he
wanted
to
stroll
among
the
fruit
trees
in
the
courtyard
of
the
anguri
bagh
which
lay
down
the
marble
steps
from
the
khas
mahal
the
breezy
upper
pavilion
of
the
but
when
he
reached
the
trees
he
had
turned
and
slipped
through
his
private
doorway
leading
to
the
women
apartments
in
the
lower
level
of
the
fort
the
quiet
even
the
eunuchs
were
dozing
and
no
one
noticed
when
he
passed
along
the
shadowed
afternoon
corridor
toward
the
circular
staircase
leading
to
the
lower
apartments
as
he
began
to
descend
the
curved
stone
steps
he
felt
his
legs
momentarily
grow
unsteady
and
he
paused
to
rest
against
the
hard
polished
wall
tightening
his
light
brocade
cloak
against
the
cooler
air
and
taking
a
short
sip
of
wine
for
warmth
then
he
continued
on
carefully
feeling
for
each
step
in
the
dim
light
of
the
overhead
oil
lamps
he
emerged
on
the
next
level
and
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
on
the
balcony
that
opened
out
over
the
jamuna
this
was
the
level
where
he
had
built
private
apartments
for
his
favorite
women
and
behind
him
was
the
large
room
with
a
painted
cupola
ceiling
high
above
a
large
shaped
marble
fountain
which
he
had
granted
to
one
of
his
hindu
wives
now
he
could
no
longer
recall
precisely
who
she
was
she
had
reached
thirty
some
time
past
and
he
had
not
summoned
her
to
his
couch
in
many
years
since
she
was
a
devout
hindu
he
had
ordered
it
decorated
with
brilliantly
colored
scenes
from
the
ramayana
the
room
itself
was
cooled
by
a
high
waterfall
in
the
rear
that
murmured
down
an
inclined
and
striated
marble
slab
stairways
on
either
side
of
the
room
curved
around
to
an
overhead
balcony
directly
above
where
he
now
stood
which
was
the
post
where
eunuchs
waited
when
the
women
came
to
cool
themselves
by
the
fountain
the
balcony
where
he
now
stood
jutted
out
from
the
fort
supported
by
thick
sandstone
columns
and
from
his
position
he
could
look
along
the
side
of
the
fort
and
see
the
jasmine
tower
of
queen
janahara
when
he
realized
he
also
could
be
seen
he
instinctively
stepped
back
into
the
cool
corridor
the
women
were
inside
their
apartments
asleep
and
the
corridor
empty
as
he
began
to
descend
the
circular
stairs
leading
to
the
next
level
below
the
quarters
for
eunuchs
and
female
servants
as
he
rounded
the
last
curve
of
the
stair
and
emerged
into
the
light
three
eunuchs
stared
up
in
shock
from
their
game
of
cards
it
vaguely
registered
that
they
probably
were
gambling
which
he
had
strictly
prohibited
in
the
but
he
decided
to
ignore
it
this
afternoon
the
circular
pasteboard
cards
of
the
eunuchs
scattered
across
the
stone
floor
as
they
hurried
to
he
paused
to
drink
again
from
the
cup
and
absently
studied
the
painted
faces
on
the
cards
dropped
by
the
eunuch
nearest
him
it
was
not
a
bad
hand
lying
on
the
marble
were
four
high
cards
from
the
powerful
suits
the
lord
of
horses
the
king
of
elephants
the
king
of
infantry
and
the
throned
the
fort
and
three
from
the
weaker
suits
the
king
of
snakes
the
king
of
divinities
and
the
throned
queen
he
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
king
of
elephants
the
suit
he
always
preferred
to
play
and
wondered
at
the
happenstance
that
the
king
had
fallen
beneath
the
queen
whose
face
covered
his
golden
crown
he
shrugged
it
away
as
coincidence
and
turned
toward
the
stairs
leading
to
the
next
lower
level
two
more
levels
remained
the
air
was
increasingly
musty
now
noticeably
smoky
from
the
lamps
and
he
hurried
on
reaching
the
next
landing
without
stopping
the
windows
on
this
level
had
shrunk
to
only
a
few
hand
spans
and
now
they
were
secured
with
heavy
stone
latticework
the
eunuchs
were
arguing
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
and
failed
even
to
notice
him
he
told
himself
to
try
to
remember
this
and
drank
again
as
he
paused
to
listen
to
the
metrical
splash
of
the
jamuna
lapping
against
the
outer
wall
then
he
stepped
quietly
down
the
last
flight
of
stairs
the
final
level
as
he
emerged
into
the
corridor
two
guarding
eunuchs
who
had
been
dozing
leaped
to
their
feet
and
drew
swords
before
recognizing
him
both
fell
on
their
face
in
their
turbans
tumbling
across
the
stone
floor
arangbar
said
nothing
merely
pointed
toward
a
doorway
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
the
startled
eunuchs
strained
against
their
fat
as
they
lifted
torches
from
the
walls
and
then
turned
officiously
to
lead
the
way
as
they
walked
arangbar
paused
to
stare
through
an
arched
doorway
leading
into
a
large
domed
room
off
the
side
of
the
hall
a
dozen
eunuchs
were
inside
some
holding
torches
while
others
laced
a
white
cotton
rope
through
a
wooden
pulley
attached
to
the
lower
side
of
a
heavy
wooden
beam
that
spanned
the
room
approximately
ten
feet
above
the
floor
the
two
eunuchs
with
arangbar
also
stopped
wondering
if
his
majesty
had
come
to
supervise
the
hanging
that
afternoon
of
the
two
who
had
been
discovered
in
a
flagrant
sexual
act
in
the
shish
mahal
the
mirrored
arangbar
studied
the
hanging
room
for
a
moment
with
glazed
eyes
not
remembering
that
he
had
sentenced
the
women
that
same
morning
and
then
waved
the
guards
on
along
the
corridor
past
the
doors
that
secured
dark
cells
these
were
the
cells
used
to
confine
women
who
had
broken
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
was
a
door
wider
than
the
others
and
behind
it
was
a
special
cell
with
a
window
overlooking
the
jamuna
he
walked
directly
to
the
door
and
drank
again
from
his
cup
as
he
ordered
it
opened
the
guards
were
there
at
once
keys
jangling
the
door
was
massive
and
thick
and
it
creaked
heavily
on
its
hinges
as
they
pushed
it
slowly
inward
from
the
gloom
came
the
unmistakable
fragrance
of
musk
and
sandalwood
he
inhaled
it
for
a
moment
and
it
seemed
to
penetrate
his
memory
calling
up
long
forgotten
pleasures
grasping
the
door
for
support
he
moved
past
the
bowing
guards
and
into
the
cell
there
standing
by
the
small
barred
window
her
face
caught
in
a
shaft
of
afternoon
sun
was
shirin
her
eyes
were
carefully
darkened
with
kohl
and
her
mouth
red
and
fresh
she
wore
a
gossamer
scarf
decorated
with
gold
thread
and
a
thin
skirt
that
betrayed
the
curve
of
her
thighs
against
the
outline
of
her
flowered
trousers
the
musty
air
of
the
room
was
immersed
in
her
perfume
as
though
by
her
very
being
she
would
defy
the
walls
of
her
prison
she
looked
just
as
he
had
remembered
she
turned
and
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
seeming
not
to
believe
what
she
saw
then
her
eyes
hardened
shall
i
my
sentence
arangbar
said
nothing
as
he
examined
her
wordlessly
sipping
slowly
from
his
cup
now
more
than
ever
he
realized
why
she
had
once
been
his
favorite
she
could
bring
him
to
ecstasy
and
then
recite
persian
poetry
to
him
for
hours
she
had
been
exquisite
you
as
beautiful
as
ever
too
beautiful
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
with
you
i
expect
that
i
will
die
your
majesty
that
i
think
is
the
usual
sentence
for
the
women
who
disobey
you
you
could
have
stayed
in
surat
where
you
were
sent
or
gone
on
to
goa
with
the
husband
i
gave
you
but
instead
you
returned
here
why
arangbar
eased
himself
onto
the
stone
bench
beside
the
door
i
do
think
you
would
understand
majesty
did
you
come
because
of
the
inglish
i
learned
yesterday
that
you
conspired
to
meet
with
him
it
displeased
me
very
much
he
was
not
responsible
majesty
i
met
with
him
because
i
chose
to
but
i
came
to
agra
to
be
with
samad
again
her
voice
began
to
tremble
slightly
samad
is
guilty
of
nothing
except
defiance
of
the
mullahs
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
if
you
want
to
hear
me
beg
for
him
i
will
arangbar
seemed
not
to
notice
the
tear
that
stained
the
kohl
beneath
one
eye
it
was
a
death
sentence
for
you
to
disobey
me
and
come
back
perhaps
you
actually
want
to
die
is
there
nothing
you
would
die
for
majesty
arangbar
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
window
its
hexagonal
grillwork
throwing
a
pattern
across
his
glazed
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
searching
for
words
yes
perhaps
i
might
die
for
india
perhaps
someday
soon
i
will
but
i
would
never
die
for
the
glory
of
islam
his
gaze
came
back
to
shirin
and
certainly
not
for
some
sufi
mullah
samad
is
not
a
mullah
by
force
of
will
she
held
any
trace
of
shrillness
from
her
voice
he
is
a
persian
poet
one
of
the
greatest
ever
you
know
that
he
defies
the
because
he
will
not
bow
to
their
dogma
the
want
his
head
arangbar
examined
his
empty
cup
and
tossed
it
to
the
floor
listening
as
the
silver
rang
hard
against
the
stone
it
seems
a
small
price
for
tranquility
whose
tranquility
theirs
the
tears
were
gone
now
her
eyes
again
defiant
mine
every
day
i
flooded
with
petitions
about
this
or
that
heresy
it
wearies
and
consumes
me
samad
ignored
the
laws
of
islam
and
he
has
followers
you
ignore
the
laws
of
islam
arangbar
laughed
it
true
between
us
i
despise
the
mullahs
you
know
i
once
told
them
i
had
decided
to
become
a
christian
because
i
enjoyed
eating
pork
and
the
prophet
denied
it
to
all
men
the
next
day
they
brought
the
quran
and
declared
although
it
was
true
pork
was
denied
to
men
the
prophet
said
nothing
specifically
about
what
a
king
could
eat
so
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
become
a
christian
he
paused
and
sobered
but
samad
is
not
a
king
he
is
a
sufi
the
mullahs
claim
that
if
he
dead
the
inspiration
for
heresy
will
die
with
him
they
say
his
death
will
serve
as
an
example
i
hear
this
everywhere
even
from
her
majesty
her
majesty
shirin
searched
for
his
eyes
as
she
spoke
but
they
were
shrouded
in
shadow
does
she
make
laws
for
you
now
she
disrupts
my
tranquility
with
all
her
talk
about
islam
and
perhaps
it
age
she
never
used
to
talk
about
the
but
now
she
wants
to
bring
the
islam
of
persia
to
india
she
forbade
sunni
mullahs
even
to
attend
the
wedding
but
if
it
pleases
her
what
does
it
matter
i
despise
them
all
but
why
samad
why
sentence
him
to
death
frankly
i
do
really
care
about
this
poet
either
way
but
he
has
not
tried
to
help
himself
when
i
allowed
him
to
confront
the
mullahs
who
accused
him
he
refused
to
recite
the
kalima
is
no
god
but
allah
what
did
he
say
perhaps
just
to
spite
them
he
would
only
recite
the
first
phrase
is
no
god
the
negation
he
refused
to
recite
the
rest
the
affirmation
he
said
he
was
still
searching
for
truth
that
when
he
finally
saw
god
he
would
recite
the
remainder
that
to
affirm
his
existence
without
proof
would
be
giving
false
evidence
i
thought
the
mullahs
would
strangle
him
on
the
spot
arangbar
laughed
to
himself
as
he
watched
her
turn
again
to
the
window
you
have
to
admit
that
qualifies
as
blasphemy
by
any
measure
so
if
the
mullahs
want
him
so
badly
why
not
let
them
have
him
but
samad
is
a
mystic
a
pantheist
shirin
returned
her
eyes
to
arangbar
for
him
god
is
everywhere
not
just
where
the
mullahs
choose
to
put
him
do
you
remember
those
quatrains
in
his
rubaiyat
that
say
here
in
the
garden
the
sunshine
glows
a
presence
moves
in
all
that
grows
he
is
the
lover
the
belov
too
he
is
the
bramble
and
the
rose
we
know
him
when
our
hearts
are
moved
he
our
lover
and
our
loved
open
your
eyes
with
joy
and
see
the
hundred
ways
his
love
is
proved
i
seen
his
poetry
it
sings
of
the
love
of
some
god
although
his
god
sounds
a
bit
too
benign
to
be
allah
but
i
also
know
his
rubaiyat
will
not
save
him
it
may
make
him
immortal
someday
but
he
be
long
since
dead
by
then
arangbar
rose
unsteadily
and
moved
beside
her
staring
out
onto
the
glinting
surface
of
the
jamuna
for
a
moment
he
watched
a
fleet
of
barges
pass
piled
high
with
dark
bundles
of
indigo
i
believe
i
myself
will
die
someday
soon
i
can
almost
feel
my
strength
ebbing
but
i
hope
i
be
remembered
as
my
father
akman
is
a
ruler
who
tolerated
all
faiths
i
protected
hindus
from
the
bigoted
followers
of
mohammed
religion
who
would
convert
them
forcibly
to
islam
and
allowed
all
religions
to
build
places
of
worship
did
you
know
even
built
a
church
for
the
portuguese
jesuits
who
have
to
buy
most
of
their
converts
with
bribes
i
even
gave
them
a
stipend
since
they
would
starve
otherwise
they
tell
me
they
astonished
i
allow
so
much
religious
freedom
here
since
it
unheard
of
in
europe
but
i
can
do
all
this
only
if
i
remain
the
nominal
defender
of
islam
islam
holds
the
power
in
india
and
as
india
ruler
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
can
defy
the
mullahs
myself
now
and
then
but
i
ca
permit
your
sufi
mystic
to
do
it
too
there
a
limit
you
can
do
anything
if
you
wish
the
orthodox
mullahs
have
always
hated
mystics
the
mullahs
are
men
who
live
on
hate
you
see
it
burning
in
their
eyes
they
even
hate
their
own
women
ca
you
see
they
keep
them
prisoner
claiming
that
the
way
they
honor
and
respect
them
the
mullahs
even
resent
that
samad
allows
me
to
come
into
his
presence
without
a
veil
they
say
he
a
poison
in
islam
yes
his
example
is
poison
his
poetry
is
filled
with
love
the
mullahs
can
not
bear
it
since
their
own
lives
are
filled
with
hate
god
help
india
if
it
ever
becomes
an
state
there
be
mobs
in
the
streets
murdering
hindus
in
the
name
of
is
that
the
tranquility
you
want
i
want
to
die
in
peace
just
like
your
poet
and
i
want
to
be
remembered
for
the
good
i
done
for
india
arangbar
paused
seeming
to
search
on
the
stone
ledge
for
his
cup
i
think
samad
will
be
remembered
too
tomorrow
i
make
him
famous
let
him
live
on
through
his
words
he
knows
and
i
know
that
he
must
die
we
understand
each
other
perfectly
i
ca
disappoint
him
now
arangbar
suddenly
recalled
the
rajput
raja
who
had
asked
for
an
early
audience
in
the
and
he
turned
and
moved
unsteadily
toward
the
door
when
he
reached
it
he
revolved
and
looked
back
sadly
at
shirin
i
found
myself
dreaming
about
you
this
afternoon
i
do
know
why
so
i
decided
to
come
and
see
you
alone
i
did
come
to
talk
about
samad
it
you
i
uncertain
about
her
majesty
wants
you
hanged
but
i
can
not
yet
find
the
courage
to
sentence
you
arangbar
continued
on
wearily
toward
the
door
where
will
it
all
end
he
paused
and
as
though
remembering
something
turned
again
jadar
is
plotting
something
against
me
i
sense
it
but
i
do
know
what
he
can
do
recently
i
heard
rumors
you
part
of
it
have
you
turned
against
me
if
you
kill
samad
i
will
defy
you
with
every
power
i
have
then
perhaps
i
should
execute
you
he
stared
at
her
trying
to
focus
but
you
have
no
powers
left
unless
you
plotting
something
with
the
inglish
if
you
are
then
i
will
kill
you
both
he
turned
to
leave
tightening
his
cloak
against
the
chill
the
guards
saw
him
emerge
and
hurried
from
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
arangbar
watched
them
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
looked
one
last
time
at
shirin
samad
will
die
tomorrow
you
will
have
to
wait
brian
hawksworth
lean
frame
towered
above
the
crowd
conspicuous
in
jerkin
and
seaboots
he
had
heard
the
rumor
and
he
had
come
to
the
plaza
to
watch
mingling
among
the
turbaned
assembly
of
nobles
shopkeepers
mullahs
and
assorted
street
touts
his
presence
was
immediately
noted
by
all
especially
the
crippled
beggars
in
dirty
brown
who
dragged
themselves
through
the
crowd
their
hands
upturned
calling
for
a
in
the
name
of
allah
they
knew
from
experience
that
however
ragged
a
appear
he
was
always
more
likely
to
be
moved
by
their
plight
than
a
wealthy
indian
merchant
the
plaza
was
a
confined
area
between
the
steep
eastern
side
of
the
red
fort
and
the
outer
wall
of
the
fortress
beyond
the
fortress
wall
lay
the
wide
jamuna
river
while
high
above
and
with
a
commanding
view
of
the
plaza
sat
arangbar
watching
from
the
black
throne
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
next
to
him
sat
queen
janahara
and
allaudin
the
day
was
tuesday
and
the
sun
was
approaching
midday
as
hawksworth
pushed
his
way
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
the
last
elephant
fight
of
the
morning
had
just
begun
two
bull
elephants
were
locked
head
to
head
in
the
dusty
square
their
blunted
tusks
were
wreathed
with
brass
rings
and
the
back
of
each
was
covered
with
a
brocaded
canvas
on
which
sat
two
riders
perched
on
each
animal
neck
and
directing
it
was
its
mahout
and
on
its
rump
sat
its
keeper
whose
assignment
was
to
urge
the
animal
to
greater
frenzy
the
dusty
air
was
alive
with
a
festive
clanging
from
large
bells
attached
to
each
elephant
harness
hawksworth
noticed
that
a
long
chain
called
the
was
secured
to
the
left
foreleg
of
each
elephant
and
circled
over
its
back
where
it
was
attached
to
a
heavy
log
held
by
the
second
rider
both
elephants
also
had
other
keepers
who
ran
alongside
holding
long
poles
at
the
end
of
which
was
crossed
a
long
piece
of
bamboo
nearby
another
keeper
stood
holding
a
smoldering
taper
hawksworth
watched
in
awe
as
the
elephants
backed
away
and
lunged
together
again
and
again
tusk
resounding
against
tusk
often
rearing
on
their
hind
legs
as
each
strained
for
advantage
do
you
have
a
favorite
a
man
with
a
slightly
soiled
turban
was
tugging
at
hawksworth
sleeve
there
is
still
time
to
wager
no
thanks
hawksworth
moved
to
brush
him
aside
but
it
is
our
habit
in
india
to
wager
on
the
elephants
sahib
perhaps
the
sahib
does
not
yet
know
indian
customs
he
pushed
closer
directly
in
hawksworth
face
his
few
remaining
teeth
were
stained
red
with
betel
i
myself
am
a
poor
judge
of
elephants
l
can
never
guess
which
will
win
still
i
love
to
wager
may
allah
forgive
me
i
not
here
to
bet
just
this
once
sahib
for
my
weakness
he
turned
and
pointed
through
the
dust
although
the
dark
elephant
is
smaller
and
already
growing
tired
i
will
even
offer
to
bet
on
him
to
give
you
a
guest
in
india
a
chance
to
win
so
when
you
return
to
your
you
will
say
there
is
one
honest
man
in
india
i
will
wager
you
ten
rupees
the
dark
one
will
be
declared
the
winner
the
man
backed
away
for
an
instant
and
discreetly
assessed
hawksworth
worn
jerkin
with
a
quick
glance
if
ten
rupees
are
too
much
i
will
wager
you
five
hawksworth
studied
the
two
elephants
again
the
dark
one
was
slightly
smaller
and
did
seem
to
be
growing
tired
the
other
elephant
larger
and
brown
had
a
mahout
less
skilled
but
he
also
clearly
was
gaining
the
advantage
all
right
i
take
the
brown
hawksworth
reached
for
his
purse
feeling
slightly
relieved
that
it
was
still
there
and
i
lay
twenty
rupees
as
pleases
the
sahib
the
man
smiled
broadly
the
sahib
must
be
a
very
rich
man
in
his
even
as
he
spoke
the
large
brown
elephant
wheeled
and
slammed
its
black
adversary
in
the
side
with
its
tusks
barely
missing
the
leg
of
the
mahout
the
black
elephant
staggered
backward
against
the
side
of
the
fort
it
was
now
clearly
on
the
defensive
as
the
larger
elephant
began
slamming
it
repeatedly
in
the
side
hawksworth
found
himself
caught
up
in
the
taste
of
imminent
victory
charkhi
charkhi
a
cry
began
to
rise
from
the
crowd
the
man
holding
the
burning
taper
looked
up
toward
arangbar
who
signaled
lightly
with
his
hand
then
the
men
holding
the
long
poles
tipped
them
toward
the
taper
and
the
two
ends
of
papered
bamboo
were
quickly
ignited
the
bamboo
sticks
started
to
whirl
like
pinwheels
popping
and
throwing
sparks
from
the
gunpowder
packed
inside
the
keepers
turned
and
thrust
the
poles
under
the
face
of
the
brown
elephant
sending
him
rearing
backward
in
fright
although
the
black
elephant
now
lay
crushed
against
the
wall
the
brown
was
too
distracted
by
the
sudden
noise
to
press
his
advantage
instead
he
wheeled
away
from
the
exploding
bamboo
and
began
to
charge
wildly
toward
the
edge
of
the
crowd
retreating
bodies
pummeled
about
hawksworth
and
there
were
frightened
calls
of
as
the
elephant
neared
the
crowd
its
second
rider
with
a
look
of
infinite
regret
threw
down
the
log
chained
to
its
forefoot
the
chain
whipped
against
its
leg
and
in
moments
it
was
tangled
and
stumbling
by
then
the
smaller
black
elephant
had
recovered
its
feet
and
came
galloping
in
chase
in
moments
he
was
there
slamming
his
larger
adversary
with
his
tusks
the
brown
elephant
stumbled
awkwardly
tangled
in
the
chain
and
then
collapsed
into
the
dust
with
a
victory
yell
the
mahout
of
the
black
elephant
pulled
a
cord
releasing
a
canvas
cloth
over
its
eyes
the
heaving
animal
immediately
began
to
gentle
and
its
jubilant
keepers
ran
forward
to
lead
it
away
your
elephant
lost
sahib
my
regrettings
may
i
have
the
twenty
rupees
but
it
was
fixed
hawksworth
held
tightly
to
his
purse
the
brown
was
clearly
winning
before
he
was
frightened
by
the
damned
fireworks
did
i
neglect
to
tell
the
sahib
that
the
black
elephant
is
a
from
his
majesty
private
stable
his
majesty
does
not
like
to
see
his
elephants
lose
you
conniving
bastard
his
majesty
makes
the
rules
sahib
it
is
permitted
to
use
the
once
during
a
contest
if
his
majesty
judges
that
the
elephants
need
to
be
disciplined
may
allah
grant
you
better
luck
next
week
the
man
stood
waiting
hand
outstretched
you
a
damned
thief
that
is
a
harsh
judgment
sahib
i
am
merely
a
poor
man
who
must
live
if
you
wait
you
will
see
what
happens
to
criminals
here
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
hawksworth
began
to
count
out
the
twenty
silver
rupees
trying
to
look
as
sporting
as
he
could
muster
he
found
himself
in
grudging
admiration
of
the
swindler
style
then
he
suddenly
realized
what
the
man
had
said
the
rumors
must
have
been
right
you
mean
there
be
an
execution
this
is
the
day
his
majesty
always
has
executions
on
tuesday
after
the
elephant
fights
hawksworth
looked
up
to
see
another
bull
elephant
being
ridden
into
the
plaza
he
had
sharpened
tusks
each
decorated
with
a
single
heavy
brass
ring
and
was
guided
by
a
single
rider
a
unshaven
mahout
the
elephant
was
festooned
with
bells
but
there
were
no
chains
about
any
of
its
legs
at
the
other
end
of
the
square
a
balding
man
with
a
short
black
beard
and
a
ragged
green
cloak
was
being
dragged
forward
by
imperial
guards
hawksworth
noticed
that
his
arms
had
been
bound
behind
him
by
a
heavy
cord
circled
just
above
the
elbows
his
eyes
brimmed
with
fear
the
guards
shoved
him
struggling
toward
the
middle
of
the
plaza
when
they
reached
the
central
clearing
the
officer
of
the
guard
knocked
him
to
his
knees
with
the
butt
end
of
a
lance
the
stunned
prisoner
turned
to
watch
in
terror
as
the
elephant
lumbered
toward
him
flapping
its
ears
in
anticipation
he
was
sentenced
yesterday
sahib
what
did
he
do
steal
some
nobleman
sheep
in
england
that
a
hanging
offense
oh
no
sahib
islamic
law
does
not
give
the
death
penalty
for
theft
unless
a
thief
is
notorious
and
even
then
he
must
be
caught
in
the
act
if
it
is
proved
you
have
stolen
something
worth
more
than
a
certain
amount
then
the
sentence
is
to
have
your
right
hand
cut
off
but
for
that
to
happen
there
must
either
be
two
witnesses
or
the
thief
must
himself
confess
islamic
law
is
not
cruel
it
is
just
what
this
man
accused
of
then
he
was
tried
and
found
guilty
under
islamic
law
of
a
willful
murder
his
name
is
kaliyan
and
he
is
a
hindu
and
the
son
of
bijai
ganga
ram
he
is
accused
of
having
kept
a
common
muslim
woman
as
his
concubine
and
when
the
woman
father
discovered
this
and
went
to
reclaim
her
to
restore
his
family
honor
this
man
murdered
him
and
buried
him
behind
his
house
he
confessed
the
act
yesterday
morning
before
his
majesty
the
elephant
moved
with
calm
deliberation
toward
the
kneeling
prisoner
guided
by
the
mahout
until
it
towered
directly
over
the
quivering
man
suddenly
it
whipped
its
trunk
about
the
man
torso
and
lifted
him
squirming
into
the
air
holding
him
firmly
against
its
banded
tusks
it
swung
the
screaming
man
back
and
forth
in
delight
for
a
long
moment
seeming
to
relish
the
torment
then
dashed
him
violently
to
the
ground
the
prisoner
hit
on
his
back
gasping
and
weakly
tried
to
roll
to
his
feet
before
he
could
gain
his
footing
the
elephant
was
there
again
seizing
him
once
more
with
its
leathery
trunk
and
again
slamming
him
to
the
ground
the
elephant
will
torment
him
for
a
time
sahib
before
the
moment
of
death
the
small
brown
man
eyes
shone
in
anticipation
again
the
prisoner
was
lifted
and
again
dashed
to
the
ground
now
he
no
longer
attempted
to
struggle
he
merely
lay
moaning
in
a
broken
voice
then
the
mahout
shouted
something
to
the
elephant
and
the
animal
suddenly
reared
above
the
man
crushing
down
on
him
with
both
front
feet
there
was
a
final
rending
scream
and
then
silence
as
blood
sprayed
over
the
dust
the
elephant
reared
again
and
again
mashed
the
lifeless
body
then
again
finally
the
animal
placed
one
foot
on
the
man
lower
torso
and
seized
his
crushed
chest
with
its
trunk
wrenching
upward
and
rending
the
body
in
two
maddened
by
the
smell
of
blood
he
whipped
the
torn
half
upward
and
slammed
it
once
more
against
the
hard
earth
finally
the
mahout
tapped
the
elephant
with
his
and
began
guiding
it
toward
the
back
of
the
square
the
crowd
which
had
held
a
spellbound
silence
erupted
into
cheers
that
the
most
brutal
death
i
ever
seen
hawksworth
found
his
voice
only
after
the
initial
shock
had
passed
it
why
so
few
men
dare
to
commit
murder
sahib
but
his
majesty
is
very
just
all
criminals
are
given
a
full
islamic
trial
before
they
are
executed
hawksworth
looked
up
to
see
yet
another
man
being
led
into
the
plaza
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
died
abruptly
he
wore
only
a
loincloth
which
was
pure
white
and
his
hands
were
bound
not
behind
him
but
in
front
secured
through
a
large
wooden
clamp
that
had
been
locked
together
like
european
stocks
hawksworth
took
one
look
and
felt
his
own
groin
tighten
all
praise
to
allah
the
merciful
and
to
the
holy
prophet
on
whom
be
peace
one
of
the
mullahs
shouted
through
the
silence
he
wore
a
gray
turban
a
dingy
collarless
shirt
that
reached
to
his
knees
and
over
that
a
long
black
vest
he
carried
a
staff
and
was
barefoot
other
mullahs
clustered
around
him
immediately
and
joined
his
call
murder
murder
another
voice
began
to
chant
from
a
young
man
standing
near
hawksworth
then
other
young
men
with
him
took
up
the
cry
and
began
to
surge
forward
they
were
with
clean
white
shirts
and
trousers
and
they
awkwardly
began
to
brandish
short
swords
imperial
guards
immediately
threw
a
line
across
the
crowd
and
held
the
young
men
back
with
short
pikes
while
the
crowd
watched
the
prisoner
continued
to
walk
alone
and
unescorted
toward
the
center
of
the
square
hawksworth
studied
the
face
again
the
deep
sad
eyes
above
a
flowing
white
beard
and
there
was
no
doubt
he
turned
to
the
man
standing
beside
him
do
you
know
who
that
is
of
course
sahib
he
the
heretic
poet
samad
did
you
hear
that
he
denied
the
existence
of
allah
in
an
islamic
court
he
has
been
sentenced
to
death
who
are
those
men
with
the
swords
they
his
disciples
i
think
they
came
today
to
try
to
save
him
hawksworth
turned
to
see
the
elephant
again
being
urged
forward
what
about
what
about
the
persian
woman
i
heard
was
arrested
with
him
i
do
not
think
she
has
been
executed
yet
sahib
they
say
she
will
be
hanged
secretly
in
the
fort
women
are
not
executed
by
elephant
when
hawksworth
struggled
to
contain
his
voice
when
do
they
say
she
be
hanged
perhaps
in
a
week
or
two
perhaps
she
is
already
dead
he
moved
forward
to
watch
what
do
poor
believers
know
of
justice
inside
the
fort
but
the
heretic
samad
will
die
for
all
to
see
so
there
will
be
no
rumors
that
he
still
lives
already
there
are
stories
in
agra
that
he
had
escaped
to
persia
samad
had
reached
the
center
of
the
square
as
the
elephant
approached
he
turned
to
the
crowd
of
young
men
raising
his
bound
hands
toward
them
in
a
gesture
of
recognition
do
not
grieve
for
this
weak
clay
his
voice
was
sonorous
hypnotic
and
the
crowd
fell
curiously
quiet
grieve
for
yourselves
you
who
must
travel
on
a
short
while
sorrowing
still
the
crowd
erupted
again
the
mullahs
and
many
others
urging
his
death
the
young
followers
decrying
it
again
he
lifted
his
hands
and
his
voice
seemed
to
bring
silence
around
it
i
say
to
you
do
not
grieve
you
will
all
soon
know
far
greater
sorrow
soon
death
will
lay
his
dark
hand
across
the
city
of
agra
upon
muslim
and
hindu
alike
upon
woman
and
child
many
will
perish
without
cause
therefore
grieve
not
for
me
grieve
for
yourselves
when
death
will
descend
upon
your
doorsteps
there
to
take
the
innocent
sorrow
for
your
own
the
crowd
had
listened
in
hushed
silence
then
a
bearded
mullah
shouted
death
to
the
heretic
and
others
took
up
the
cry
samad
watched
the
elephant
quietly
as
it
continued
to
lumber
forward
when
it
reached
him
he
bowed
to
it
with
an
ironic
smile
the
mahout
looked
upward
toward
the
black
throne
of
the
where
arangbar
and
janahara
sat
waiting
arangbar
turned
to
the
queen
with
what
seemed
a
question
and
she
replied
without
moving
her
stare
from
the
court
below
arangbar
paused
a
moment
then
signaled
the
mahout
to
proceed
the
bearded
mahout
saluted
the
moghul
then
urged
the
elephant
forward
with
his
sharp
the
elephant
flapped
its
bloodstained
ears
in
confusion
but
did
not
move
the
mahout
goaded
it
again
and
shouted
something
in
its
ear
but
it
merely
waved
its
trunk
and
trumpeted
merciful
allah
the
elephant
does
not
smell
his
crime
the
small
man
caught
hawksworth
questioning
look
the
great
akman
believed
elephants
would
not
kill
an
innocent
man
that
they
can
always
smell
a
man
guilt
but
i
have
never
before
seen
one
refuse
to
kill
a
prisoner
i
think
samad
must
be
a
wizard
who
has
entranced
the
animal
innocent
a
young
man
from
the
group
of
disciples
yelled
out
above
the
silence
the
mahout
goaded
the
elephant
once
more
but
still
it
stood
unmoving
innocent
more
cries
went
up
from
samad
young
followers
and
again
they
pressed
forward
swords
in
hand
in
moments
the
plaza
became
a
battleground
blood
staining
the
earth
as
the
imperial
guards
began
turning
their
pikes
against
the
line
of
disciples
then
others
in
the
crowd
mullahs
leading
them
broke
through
and
joined
the
battle
against
the
young
men
sword
rang
against
sword
and
calls
to
allah
rent
the
air
samad
stood
quietly
watching
as
the
battle
edged
toward
him
then
suddenly
a
group
of
bearded
mullahs
broke
from
the
crowd
and
surged
toward
him
swords
drawn
hawksworth
instinctively
reached
for
his
own
weapon
but
the
man
beside
him
caught
his
arm
he
looked
down
to
see
a
small
against
his
chest
this
is
the
will
of
allah
an
infidel
must
not
interfere
the
mullahs
had
formed
a
ring
around
samad
he
stood
silently
waiting
as
the
leader
stepped
forward
and
thrust
a
long
sword
into
the
bare
skin
of
his
lower
stomach
he
jerked
but
did
not
fall
standing
tall
as
another
swung
a
sharp
blade
across
his
open
neck
his
head
dropped
to
one
side
and
he
slumped
forward
as
two
more
men
thrust
swords
into
his
belly
in
seconds
he
disappeared
beneath
a
crowd
of
black
cloaks
from
a
low
latticework
window
down
the
east
side
of
the
red
fort
past
the
jasmine
tower
and
many
levels
down
the
khas
mahal
it
was
just
possible
to
see
the
center
of
the
plaza
a
woman
stood
by
the
window
watching
as
the
crowd
turned
on
the
young
men
and
one
by
one
cut
them
down
then
she
saw
a
bloodstained
body
being
hoisted
above
a
cloaked
assembly
and
carried
triumphantly
toward
the
river
gate
there
had
been
tears
as
shirin
watched
but
as
she
turned
away
toward
the
darkness
of
the
cell
her
eyes
were
hard
and
dry
chapter
hawksworth
waited
anxiously
by
the
rear
entryway
of
the
watched
the
three
jesuits
file
silently
through
the
tapestried
archway
beside
him
father
alvarez
sarmento
imperious
in
his
freshly
laundered
black
habit
moved
directly
to
the
silver
railing
that
circled
the
throne
the
old
priest
eyes
seemed
to
fairly
glow
in
triumph
behind
him
trailed
father
pinheiro
and
the
pudgy
father
francisco
da
silva
their
attempts
at
poise
marred
by
shifting
anxious
glances
of
disquiet
hawksworth
studied
all
three
and
puzzled
even
more
what
could
be
afoot
over
a
week
had
passed
since
the
death
of
samad
and
since
that
day
he
had
no
longer
been
invited
to
arangbar
evenings
in
the
even
his
requests
for
an
audience
had
been
ignored
before
the
poet
death
it
had
been
possible
for
him
to
believe
that
the
absurdity
of
samad
and
shirin
arrest
would
eventually
itself
that
the
nightmare
would
fade
into
reality
and
bring
their
release
but
the
killing
of
samad
had
blotted
out
that
illusion
when
he
saw
arangbar
presiding
high
above
the
square
signal
the
death
he
had
realized
finally
the
nightmare
was
all
too
real
since
that
time
he
had
spent
the
sleepless
nights
alone
distraught
counting
the
passage
of
each
hour
as
he
awaited
news
shirin
was
also
dead
in
his
mind
he
had
conceived
a
dozen
stratagems
to
try
to
save
her
a
dozen
arguments
threats
bargains
for
her
release
but
nothing
could
be
done
if
he
was
denied
even
an
audience
with
the
moghul
that
they
should
have
tasted
so
much
only
to
lose
it
all
he
found
himself
aware
for
the
first
time
ever
how
much
he
could
want
could
need
a
woman
like
shirin
beside
him
with
her
life
itself
seemed
renewed
she
was
like
no
other
he
had
ever
known
strong
beautiful
he
had
found
himself
admiring
the
last
most
of
all
even
though
he
still
found
it
startling
but
the
love
he
had
known
with
her
in
his
arms
now
only
made
the
despair
deeper
nothing
was
left
now
there
was
only
abiding
sorrow
loss
beyond
healing
she
had
given
him
something
he
had
never
known
something
he
realized
for
the
first
time
ever
he
no
longer
wanted
to
live
without
he
would
have
taken
her
place
a
hundred
times
over
but
even
that
seemed
impossible
then
that
morning
hope
had
appeared
almost
a
a
sudden
urgent
message
had
been
delivered
instructing
him
to
appear
once
more
in
the
it
almost
certainly
meant
arangbar
had
received
word
of
the
english
fleet
if
shirin
were
still
alive
and
there
had
been
no
news
of
her
death
it
must
mean
that
the
moghul
was
uncertain
about
her
guilt
he
was
not
a
man
who
normally
waited
to
act
and
if
she
was
alive
all
things
again
became
possible
he
had
asked
himself
again
and
again
over
the
past
week
why
he
had
suddenly
been
forgotten
by
arangbar
he
finally
concluded
it
was
the
distracting
turmoil
that
had
gripped
agra
and
the
court
since
death
the
sufi
last
words
had
been
repeated
throughout
the
city
and
already
there
were
rumors
of
impending
calamity
the
bazaars
were
alive
with
talk
of
a
persian
safavid
invasion
from
the
northwest
a
rebellion
among
the
imperial
guards
an
impending
holocaust
that
would
burn
all
agra
to
ash
a
universal
plague
the
streets
had
an
apocalyptic
air
with
omens
foreseen
in
every
temple
another
reason
for
arangbar
preoccupation
could
be
the
rumors
from
the
south
word
was
sweeping
agra
that
prince
jadar
and
his
army
had
been
savaged
by
the
deccani
forces
and
were
now
retreating
northward
with
malik
ambar
in
pursuit
if
this
story
were
true
then
the
abyssinian
defeat
of
jadar
must
have
been
overwhelming
since
rebels
did
not
normally
pursue
moghul
forces
but
this
story
was
still
merely
rumor
there
had
been
no
actual
reports
of
any
engagements
in
the
south
jadar
possible
defeat
so
the
talk
in
agra
went
had
gone
very
heavily
with
arangbar
and
accounted
for
his
increasing
dependence
on
opium
and
wine
those
who
had
seen
him
reported
the
moghul
was
growing
noticeably
weaker
and
as
his
strength
waned
so
too
did
his
authority
ever
since
the
night
of
the
wedding
queen
janahara
had
been
moving
to
assume
more
and
more
of
the
prerogatives
of
power
arangbar
already
seemed
to
be
becoming
a
figurehead
the
only
sanctuary
she
had
not
yet
invaded
was
the
those
evening
gatherings
arangbar
still
ruled
like
a
god
and
the
unusual
note
he
had
sent
to
hawksworth
was
worded
almost
more
like
an
order
than
an
invitation
it
confirmed
vividly
the
reports
that
arangbar
was
growing
more
erratic
by
the
day
around
hawksworth
sat
the
usual
assembly
of
arangbar
closest
advisers
men
whose
perpetually
smiling
faces
he
had
come
to
know
well
over
the
past
weeks
prominent
among
them
as
always
was
nadir
sharif
who
now
seemed
to
be
avoiding
hawksworth
glance
also
in
attendance
was
a
special
contingent
of
rajput
guards
in
imperial
turbans
and
tunics
hawksworth
could
never
remember
having
seen
these
particular
guards
in
the
when
the
last
official
had
arrived
the
rajput
guards
moved
across
the
doorway
and
the
kettledrum
was
sounded
moments
later
the
tapestry
behind
the
throne
was
pushed
aside
by
two
eunuchs
and
arangbar
emerged
into
the
light
he
stumbled
momentarily
on
the
edge
of
a
carpet
then
recovered
his
balance
and
took
his
seat
on
the
white
marble
throne
his
dull
eyes
glistened
against
the
lamplight
as
the
men
in
the
room
dropped
to
for
the
first
time
he
seemed
more
annoyed
than
amused
when
hawksworth
failed
to
bow
to
the
carpet
he
glared
at
him
for
a
long
moment
and
then
spoke
to
nadir
sharif
who
stood
waiting
by
his
side
the
prime
minister
turned
to
the
room
ambassador
hawksworth
his
majesty
commands
you
to
come
forward
it
was
abrupt
language
rarely
heard
in
the
and
the
room
immediately
fell
silent
hawksworth
rose
and
tightened
his
belt
feeling
his
apprehension
rising
as
he
neared
the
throne
he
found
himself
seeing
not
arangbar
expressionless
gaze
but
the
face
of
shirin
as
she
waited
for
help
inglish
stand
there
he
pointed
to
the
side
of
the
throne
opposite
the
jesuits
tell
me
any
fresh
news
of
your
king
fleet
hawksworth
felt
his
heart
explode
realizing
there
was
no
arrival
and
no
possibility
of
using
king
james
presents
to
bargain
for
shirin
i
expect
it
any
day
your
majesty
possibly
the
winds
have
been
against
them
the
winds
arangbar
turned
to
father
sarmento
his
voice
sarcastic
do
you
think
the
winds
have
been
against
them
padre
undoubtedly
majesty
sarmento
could
not
suppress
a
malicious
smile
the
winds
of
truth
they
have
been
arrested
in
a
gale
of
deception
i
object
your
majesty
to
this
papist
innuendos
hawksworth
felt
himself
suddenly
bristle
an
englishman
does
not
accept
insults
from
a
portugal
you
will
listen
quietly
to
what
you
are
about
to
hear
inglish
or
you
will
be
removed
by
my
guards
arangbar
again
turned
to
father
sarmento
padre
repeat
to
the
inglish
conspirator
what
you
told
me
this
afternoon
may
it
please
your
majesty
not
only
is
the
english
a
heretic
before
god
and
the
holy
church
he
is
also
a
liar
sarmento
paused
with
the
dramatic
timing
of
a
practiced
there
is
no
english
fleet
hawksworth
stared
at
the
jesuit
in
speechless
dismay
his
entire
being
seemed
to
crash
down
about
him
as
sarmento
continued
because
of
the
foresight
of
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
viceroy
of
goa
we
have
now
uncovered
the
truth
your
majesty
after
his
patrols
encountered
no
english
merchantmen
either
north
or
south
he
began
to
grow
suspicious
he
ordered
his
personal
guards
to
find
and
detain
the
man
who
claimed
to
have
intercepted
jadar
cipher
reporting
the
fleet
the
traitor
was
found
not
surprisingly
in
a
goan
brothel
where
he
had
been
for
many
days
spending
more
money
than
such
a
man
could
normally
earn
in
a
lifetime
he
was
brought
to
the
palace
and
interrogated
on
the
sarmento
turned
triumphantly
to
hawksworth
where
he
readily
admitted
being
paid
to
bring
a
false
report
and
who
do
you
believe
paid
him
on
that
his
excellency
is
still
uncertain
your
majesty
he
was
paid
by
agents
in
the
south
but
who
does
the
viceroy
believe
paid
the
money
the
coins
were
assayed
and
traced
to
the
mint
at
surat
your
majesty
they
were
part
of
a
special
minting
that
took
place
just
before
the
english
hawksworth
left
the
city
the
assay
also
revealed
they
were
a
debased
alloy
slightly
lower
in
silver
content
than
is
normal
although
not
enough
to
be
readily
detectable
similar
coins
have
begun
to
be
used
throughout
the
deccan
reportedly
they
were
given
out
recently
by
prince
jadar
as
back
pay
to
the
troops
of
certain
who
were
the
coins
minted
for
the
shahbandar
at
surat
mirza
nuruddin
claims
to
have
misplaced
the
records
for
this
particular
minting
however
he
maintains
the
lower
silver
content
was
probably
due
to
a
minter
oversight
the
former
governor
of
surat
mukarrab
khan
is
returning
to
the
city
to
investigate
the
minting
run
appears
to
have
been
approximately
fifty
lakhs
of
rupees
but
the
actual
silver
content
was
only
lakhs
of
rupees
he
paused
for
breath
the
shahbandar
says
he
has
no
idea
what
could
have
happened
to
the
other
lakh
worth
of
silver
bullion
authorized
to
be
used
in
the
minting
that
not
so
difficult
to
explain
knowing
mirza
nuruddin
arangbar
seemed
to
be
talking
to
himself
then
he
glanced
again
at
sarmento
of
course
the
discrepancy
would
probably
never
have
been
detected
if
the
coins
given
to
the
traitor
had
not
been
melted
down
and
assayed
the
question
remains
who
ordered
him
paid
arangbar
turned
to
hawksworth
who
stood
with
his
mind
churning
refusing
to
accept
the
consequences
of
what
he
was
hearing
it
meant
the
end
of
everything
perhaps
the
inglish
ambassador
can
help
explain
it
i
have
no
idea
why
there
was
a
false
report
majesty
i
believed
it
too
did
you
inglish
arangbar
glared
down
drunkenly
from
his
throne
or
did
you
plot
this
with
prince
jadar
when
you
met
with
him
in
burhanpur
did
you
and
he
conspire
together
to
deceive
me
exchanging
bribes
in
the
pocket
of
the
prince
with
some
of
this
debased
silver
coin
for
his
help
in
a
ruse
you
thought
would
produce
a
brought
to
my
ears
i
gave
nothing
to
the
prince
majesty
and
i
asked
nothing
from
him
that
is
the
truth
the
truth
from
you
is
not
always
easy
to
obtain
inglish
your
deceptions
have
distressed
me
very
much
and
curiously
enough
her
majesty
even
more
there
is
no
fleet
inglish
instead
there
are
lies
by
you
and
i
beginning
to
suspect
now
by
my
own
son
i
no
longer
have
any
idea
what
he
is
doing
in
the
south
but
i
fear
his
arrogance
has
brought
ruin
to
his
army
i
am
recalling
him
to
agra
immediately
for
an
inquiry
and
i
am
hereby
ordering

the
title
of
ambassador

as

conspirator

and

of
this
moment

are
stripped
of
your
title
of
khan
he
motioned
to
the
rajput
guards

him
away
hawksworth
turned
to
see
father
sarmento
beaming
alas
it
seems
we
soon
must
part
ambassador
may
god
in
his
mercy
grant
you
a
pleasant
and
speedy
journey
should
you
wish
to
travel
through
goa
i
can
give
you
a
letter
to
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
requesting
safe
passage
on
a
westbound
galleon
damn
your
viceroy
as
hawksworth
turned
back
toward
arangbar
he
felt
rough
hands
close
about
his
arms
before
he
could
speak
he
was
being
guided
through
the
rear
doorway
and
into
the
long
gallery
leading
to
the
public
square
majesty
nadir
sharif
watched
the
curtains
close
behind
hawksworth
then
rose
and
moved
closer
to
the
throne
may
it
please
you
the
englishman
unfortunately
remains
my
guest
at
least
for
a
few
more
days
as
his
host
i
feel
a
trifling
obligation
to
see
he
finds
his
way
home
safely
i
ask
leave
to
excuse
myself
for
a
few
moments
to
ensure
he
finds
a
palanquin
as
you
wish
arangbar
was
watching
a
eunuch
bring
in
a
box
of
opium
when
nadir
sharif
moved
toward
the
doorway
father
pinheiro
rose
unobtrusively
and
slipped
out
behind
him
as
the
jesuit
moved
into
the
hallway
he
appeared
not
to
hurry
but
his
brisk
walk
brought
him
alongside
the
prime
minister
midway
down
the
corridor
have
you
told
her
majesty
as
we
agreed
told
her
what
nadir
sharif
did
not
break
his
pace
or
remove
his
eyes
from
hawksworth
still
being
led
by
the
guards
several
yards
ahead
about
the
ship
that
would
be
seized
nadir
sharif
stopped
as
though
hit
by
an
arrow
but
surely
you
not
take
the
vessel
now
did
you
see
that
the
englishman
has
been
ordered
out
of
agra
he
finished
there
certainly
be
no
trading
him
now
or
ever
but
the
warships
were
dispatched
from
surat
day
before
yesterday
just
before
the
pigeons
arrived
from
goa
with
the
word
of
the
hoax
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
message
revoking
their
order
to
sail
arrived
a
day
too
late
they
were
already
at
sea
the
indian
ship
may
have
already
been
seized
nadir
sharif
inspected
him
with
astonishment
your
viceroy
must
be
mad
to
take
the
vessel
now
there
no
purpose
in
it
his
majesty
will
be
most
annoyed
but
you
were
the
one
who
suggested
it
the
jesuit
voice
rose
quivering
in
dismay
you
said
that
bold
measures
were
for
bold
men
those
were
your
words
his
excellency
agreed
it
would
be
a
decisive
stroke
of
firmness
and
what
does
father
sarmento
think
of
this
folly
father
sarmento
does
not
yet
know
i
thought
it
best
not
to
inform
him
pinheiro
eyes
were
despairing
what
did
her
majesty
queen
janahara
say
about
the
plan
what
do
you
mean
we
agreed
you
would
tell
her
i
not
forgotten
our
agreement
i
been
watching
carefully
for
the
right
moment
she
does
not
even
know
pinheiro
seized
his
arm
and
stared
at
him
incredulously
but
i
told
his
excellency
you
i
planned
to
tell
her
any
day
the
time
was
approaching
but
now
given
what
has
happened
then
he
smiled
and
touched
the
arm
lightly
but
i
think
she
can
still
bring
reason
to
his
majesty
it
can
all
be
readily
explained
as
a
misunderstanding
but
you
must
tell
her
immediately
pinheiro
shock
was
growing
if
she
hears
of
it
before
you
explained
she
think
of
course
but
there
no
reason
yet
for
concern
nadir
sharif
smiled
again
i
assure
you
it
all
can
be
handled
very
routinely
but
please
tell
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
not
to
do
anything
else
this
for
at
least
a
week
i
can
only
excuse
so
much
at
one
time
as
nadir
sharif
turned
to
continue
down
the
corridor
pinheiro
reached
out
and
seized
his
arm
again
you
must
also
do
one
other
thing
you
must
make
sure
the
englishman
is
removed
from
agra
immediately
we
both
know
his
majesty
may
well
forget
by
tomorrow
that
he
has
ordered
him
gone
this
time
i
doubt
very
much
his
majesty
will
forget
it
will
only
be
a
matter
of
days
in
any
case
nadir
sharif
turned
and
smiled
and
remember
what
i
told
you
that
as
far
as
his
majesty
is
concerned
i
know
nothing
about
your
viceroy
impetuous
act
but
i
do
advise
you
to
inform
father
sarmento
before
he
hears
it
in
open
he
be
furious
he
probably
order
me
back
to
goa
i
doubt
it
i
sure
he
knows
your
value
here
nadir
sharif
turned
without
another
word
and
hurried
on
down
the
corridor
ahead
of
him
hawksworth
was
being
led
by
the
guards
through
the
marble
archways
as
they
reached
the
end
facing
the
doorway
leading
to
the
courtyard
stairs
he
turned
one
last
time
and
stared
back
seeing
nadir
sharif
for
the
first
time
what
do
you
want
now
my
money
or
my
life
or
both
i
merely
came
to
see
you
safely
home
ambassador
nadir
sharif
waved
the
guards
back
toward
the
and
they
bowed
with
relief
as
they
turned
to
retreat
and
to
offer
my
condolences
and
no
doubt
to
cozen
me
as
well
i
intend
to
find
out
who
played
me
false
even
if
it
jadar
somebody
has
hell
to
pay
that
would
be
most
unwise
ambassador
i
afraid
we
were
all
a
bit
too
credulous
i
readily
confess
even
i
had
begun
to
believe
your
story
it
was
story
i
knew
nothing
about
but
you
never
denied
it
ambassador
surely
you
knew
the
truth
all
along
the
truth
is
always
wisest
that
my
cardinal
rule
in
life
but
it
could
have
been
true
it
was
entirely
possible
why
did
you
explain
that
to
arangbar
you
still
supposed
to
be
my
agent
that
would
be
rather
difficult
for
his
majesty
to
believe
given
what
really
happened
but
i
do
suppose
it
possible
nadir
sharif
patted
hawksworth
shoulder
i
see
if
there
anything
i
can
do
but
in
the
meantime
i
suggest
you
begin
preparations
to
leave
his
majesty
was
unusually
disturbed
tonight
he
disturbed
over
a
lot
of
things
most
of
which
have
little
to
do
with
me
if
you
mean
the
matter
of
the
prince
i
assure
you
it
alarming
to
us
all
no
one
is
certain
what
has
happened
in
the
south
in
fact
you
were
one
of
the
last
men
to
see
prince
jadar
he
seems
almost
to
have
disappeared
all
sorts
of
rumors
are
working
their
way
to
the
court
where
it
will
end
no
one
can
any
longer
even
guess
nadir
sharif
followed
hawksworth
out
into
the
open
square
of
the
incidentally
ambassador
did
you
yourself
know
anything
about
the
fifty
lakhs
of
silver
coin
spoken
of
tonight
hawksworth
examined
him
a
moment
maybe
the
shahbandar
stole
it
all
that
hardly
an
answer
ambassador
it
was
by
any
chance
traveling
with
you
from
surat
to
burhanpur
you
know
his
majesty
has
demanded
a
full
investigation
i
think
he
may
just
summon
mirza
nuruddin
to
agra
for
an
explanation
then
let
him
ask
mirza
nuruddin
what
happened
i
sure
he
get
the
truth
hawksworth
turned
toward
the
large
gate
at
the
far
end
of
the
square
very
well
ambassador
nadir
sharif
smiled
warmly
by
the
way
i
understand
mirza
nuruddin
has
suggested
you
may
have
smuggled
it
out
of
surat
yourself
leaving
a
worthless
letter
of
credit
in
order
to
swindle
your
merchants
the
bastard
the
truth
will
surely
come
out
ambassador
as
you
say
so
i
wish
you
good
night
and
a
restful
sleep
nadir
sharif
turned
and
in
moments
had
melted
into
the
darkness
hawksworth
slowly
worked
his
way
down
the
cobblestone
roadway
past
the
guards
at
the
amar
singh
gate
and
into
the
agra
night
he
turned
left
and
headed
toward
the
banks
of
the
jamuna
hoping
the
smells
and
sounds
of
water
would
soothe
his
mind
when
he
reached
the
riverbank
he
found
himself
looking
back
at
the
massive
walls
of
the
red
fort
wondering
again
where
shirin
was
being
kept
wanting
to
be
with
her
to
hold
her
one
last
time
but
the
high
stone
walls
stood
dark
and
mute
as
his
own
despair
you
are
home
sahib
the
servants
were
waiting
beaming
and
immaculate
in
fresh
muslin
as
hawksworth
pushed
open
the
doors
of
his
compound
it
was
nearing
midnight
your
house
is
honored
tonight
with
a
special
evening
what
are
you
planning
my
farewell
the
servants
examined
him
uncomprehending
as
he
pushed
past
the
portiere
of
the
doorway
the
room
was
heavy
with
sandalwood
incense
in
the
lamplight
he
recognized
kamala
musicians
the
flautist
in
a
long
and
bare
to
the
waist
the
drummer
smiling
widely
in
a
plain
white
shirt
and
brown
although
he
had
not
seen
them
for
days
they
paused
only
briefly
to
acknowledge
him
the
drummer
was
absorbed
in
tuning
his
instrument
using
a
small
hammer
to
tap
blocks
of
wood
wedged
beneath
the
leather
thongs
securing
the
drumhead
as
he
adjusted
the
tension
on
the
thongs
he
periodically
tested
the
pitch
against
a
note
from
the
flute
kamala
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
hawksworth
stared
about
the
room
quizzically
then
turned
to
the
musicians
they
responded
with
a
puzzled
shrug
and
motioned
toward
a
rear
door
she
summoned
them
here
tonight
sahib
she
did
not
tell
them
why
no
one
has
seen
her
all
day
it
is
very
worrying
the
servant
shuffled
uneasily
has
the
sahib
heard
the
stories
in
the
bazaar
what
stories
from
behind
the
curtains
came
the
sudden
tinkling
of
tiny
bells
the
musicians
smiled
in
recognition
as
the
servants
edged
toward
the
curtained
doorway
to
look
hawksworth
extracted
a
bottle
of
brandy
from
his
chest
and
threw
himself
down
against
a
bolster
what
this
all
about
why
ca
i
be
alone
for
once
tonight
of
all
nights
she
does
this
he
puzzled
a
moment
over
kamala
her
erratic
and
powerful
moods
then
his
thoughts
returned
gloomily
to
the
to
shirin
he
could
not
give
up
hope
never
he
never
gave
up
hope
there
was
another
tinkling
of
bells
and
the
curtain
at
the
doorway
was
swept
aside
standing
there
jewels
afire
in
the
lamplight
was
kamala
he
noticed
the
two
musicians
stare
at
her
for
an
instant
then
exchange
quick
disturbed
glances
she
was
it
seemed
more
striking
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
her
eyes
were
seductively
lined
with
her
lips
were
an
inviting
red
matching
the
large
dot
on
her
forehead
in
one
side
of
her
nose
she
wore
a
small
ring
studded
with
diamonds
her
hair
was
swept
back
and
secured
with
rows
of
rubies
and
her
throat
and
arms
were
circled
with
bands
of
gold
imbedded
with
small
green
emeralds
she
wore
a
silken
wrap
folded
in
pleats
about
each
leg
in
a
way
that
enhanced
the
full
curve
of
her
hips
her
waist
was
circled
by
a
belt
of
beaten
gold
and
her
palms
and
the
soles
of
her
feet
had
been
reddened
with
henna
as
she
came
toward
him
the
bands
of
tiny
bells
at
her
ankles
punctuated
the
sensuous
sway
of
her
breasts
beneath
her
silk
halter
you
returned
early
i
glad
as
she
moved
into
the
light
he
thought
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
profound
melancholy
in
her
eyes
he
also
noted
her
voice
was
strangely
frail
is
there
supposed
to
be
a
ceremony
tonight
i
did
know
about
as
hawksworth
studied
her
he
took
another
long
swallow
of
brandy
its
heat
burning
away
at
his
anguish
this
is
a
special
evening
i
have
decided
to
dance
bharata
natyam
one
last
time
for
lord
shiva
what
do
you
mean
one
last
time
she
seemed
to
stare
past
him
for
a
moment
then
she
slowly
turned
truly
glad
you
come
to
be
here
tonight
i
would
have
waited
for
you
but
there
was
no
time
and
i
wondered
if
you
would
really
understand
perhaps
i
was
wrong
bharata
natyam
is
never
only
for
the
dancer
so
it
is
good
you
are
here
perhaps
it
was
meant
to
be
perhaps
you
can
understand
something
of
what
i
feel
tonight
i
have
understood
much
that
happened
tonight
so
far
hawksworth
settled
his
brandy
bottle
awkwardly
onto
the
carpet
and
forced
himself
to
bring
her
into
focus
you
do
not
seem
yourself
my
she
studied
him
for
a
moment
did
you
hear
sad
news
of
your
persian
woman
nothing
but
i
afraid
i
just
lost
my
best
chance
to
save
her
i
do
understand
it
not
your
trouble
he
examined
her
wistfully
it
seems
i
be
leaving
agra
sooner
than
i
thought
so
dance
if
you
want
and
then
wish
you
well
your
trouble
is
always
my
trouble
she
frowned
as
she
studied
him
but
you
are
leaving
so
soon
she
seemed
not
to
wait
for
an
answer
as
she
went
on
never
mind
i
never
understood
the
affairs
of
ambassadors
and
kings
but
our
parting
must
not
be
sad
let
my
dance
to
shiva
be
my
farewell
to
you
she
turned
and
signaled
to
the
flautist
who
began
a
pitched
poignant
melody
have
you
ever
seen
the
bharata
natyam
never
hawksworth
sipped
more
brandy
from
the
bottle
and
found
himself
wishing
he
could
send
them
all
away
and
play
a
suite
on
his
lute
the
one
he
had
played
for
shirin
that
day
at
the
observatory
then
it
may
be
difficult
for
you
to
comprehend
at
first
with
my
body
and
my
song
i
will
tell
lord
shiva
of
my
longing
for
him
do
you
think
you
can
understand
it
i
try
hawksworth
looked
up
at
her
and
again
sensed
some
great
sadness
in
her
eyes
she
examined
him
silently
for
a
moment
but
i
want
you
to
understand
not
the
words
i
sing
they
in
ancient
sanskrit
but
if
you
watch
my
hands
they
will
also
speak
i
will
sing
to
lord
shiva
but
i
give
life
to
his
song
with
my
eyes
my
hands
my
body
i
will
the
poem
with
my
dance
my
eyes
will
speak
the
desire
of
my
heart
the
language
of
my
hands
will
tell
my
longing
for
lord
shiva
my
feet
will
show
the
rhythms
by
which
he
brings
order
to
the
world
if
you
will
try
to
feel
what
i
feel
perhaps
lord
shiva
will
touch
you
and
lighten
your
burden
and
this
is
called
bharata
natyam
what
does
that
mean
hawksworth
slipped
off
his
boots
and
wearily
tossed
them
next
to
the
carpet
the
ancient
temple
dance
of
india
is
bharata
natyam
bhava
means
mood
raga
means
song
tala
means
rhythm
all
these
are
brought
together
in
the
dance
natyam
means
the
merging
of
dance
and
story
the
true
bharata
natyam
has
seven
movements
some
are
called
pure
dance
and
these
are
only
rhythms
but
some
also
tell
a
story
if
i
were
to
dance
them
all
as
i
would
in
the
temple
i
would
have
to
dance
all
night
she
tried
wanly
to
smile
but
not
now
tonight
i
am
not
so
strong
tonight
i
will
dance
only
the
varnam
the
most
important
movement
in
it
i
will
tell
the
story
of
how
the
goddess
parvati
shiva
beloved
consort
longs
for
her
lord
if
i
dance
well
i
will
become
parvati
and
through
the
story
of
her
love
for
shiva
i
will
tell
my
own
so
it
really
just
a
love
song
it
is
parvati
song
of
longing
for
her
lord
the
words
are
very
simple
great
with
love
for
you
this
night
am
i
oh
lord
do
not
avert
yourself
from
me
do
not
tease
me
do
not
scorn
me
oh
great
oh
beautiful
god
of
the
brihadishwari
temple
great
god
who
gives
release
from
the
sorrows
of
the
world
kamala
paused
to
tighten
the
straps
securing
the
bells
around
her
ankles
the
song
goes
on
to
say
that
she
can
not
bear
even
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
nightingale
now
that
she
is
separated
from
her
lord
shiva
she
can
not
endure
the
dark
night
now
that
he
has
taken
himself
from
her
it
a
very
touching
love
song
hawksworth
found
himself
thinking
again
of
shirin
and
of
the
dark
nights
they
had
both
endured
it
is
really
much
more
you
see
lord
shiva
is
her
beloved
but
he
is
also
her
god
so
her
song
also
praises
the
beauty
of
the
great
shiva
in
all
his
many
aspects
as
her
own
consort
as
one
who
has
the
third
eye
of
knowledge
as
the
great
god
of
the
dance
nataraj
through
my
dance
i
will
show
all
the
many
aspects
of
shiva
as
creator
as
destroyer
as
lord
of
the
cosmic
rhythms
of
life
hawksworth
watched
in
groggy
fascination
as
she
rose
and
clasping
her
hands
above
her
head
bowed
toward
a
small
bronze
statue
of
the
dancing
shiva
she
had
placed
on
a
corner
table
then
as
the
drummer
took
up
a
steady
cadence
and
the
flute
began
a
searching
lament
she
struck
a
statuesque
pose
of
her
own
feet
crossed
arms
above
her
head
gradually
her
eyes
began
to
dart
seductively
from
side
to
side
growing
in
power
until
it
seemed
her
entire
body
might
explode
abruptly
she
assumed
a
second
pose
reminiscent
of
the
statue
as
the
drummer
rhythms
slowly
increased
she
began
to
follow
them
with
her
body
next
with
her
feet
slapping
heel
then
ball
fiercely
against
the
carpet
the
drummer
began
to
call
out
his
bols
the
strokes
he
was
sounding
on
the
drum
and
as
he
did
she
matched
his
rhythms
with
the
rows
of
tiny
bells
around
her
ankles
hawksworth
found
himself
being
drawn
into
her
dance
her
rhythms
were
not
flamboyant
like
those
of
the
kathak
style
but
rather
seemed
to
duplicate
some
deep
natural
cadence
as
she
returned
again
and
again
to
the
pose
of
the
dancing
shiva
it
was
pure
dance
and
he
slowly
began
to
feel
the
power
of
her
controlled
sensuality
without
warning
she
began
a
brief
song
to
shiva
in
a
pitched
repetitive
refrain
as
she
sang
her
hands
formed
the
signs
for
woman
for
beauty
for
desire
for
dozens
of
other
words
and
ideas
hawksworth
could
not
decipher
yet
her
expressive
eyes
exquisitely
translated
many
of
the
hand
signs
while
her
body
left
no
mistaking
the
intensity
of
their
emotion
when
the
song
and
its
mime
reached
some
climactic
plateau
she
suddenly
resumed
the
pure
dance
with
the
drummer
once
more
reciting
the
bols
as
he
sounded
them
again
she
matched
his
rhythms
perfectly
after
a
time
she
began
another
verse
of
the
song
by
her
mime
hawksworth
concluded
she
was
describing
some
aspect
of
lord
shiva
when
the
song
concluded
the
drummer
called
out
more
again
she
danced
only
his
rhythms
then
she
began
yet
another
verse
of
the
song
followed
by
still
more
rhythmic
dance
the
aspects
of
shiva
that
she
created
all
seemed
different
some
wise
some
fierce
some
clearly
of
a
beauty
surpassing
words
as
hawksworth
watched
he
began
to
sense
some
alien
power
growing
around
him
enveloping
him
and
his
despair
just
as
she
had
said
kamala
seemed
to
be
gradually
merging
with
an
energy
far
beyond
herself
almost
as
though
she
had
invoked
some
primal
rhythm
of
life
into
existence
and
as
he
watched
the
growing
intensity
of
her
dance
he
began
to
experience
a
deep
almost
primitive
sense
of
fear
a
stark
knowledge
of
life
and
death
beyond
words
he
found
himself
fighting
to
resist
the
force
of
some
malevolent
evil
settling
about
the
room
beginning
to
possess
it
and
all
it
contained
he
felt
its
power
begin
to
draw
out
his
own
life
hungry
and
insistent
terrifying
and
still
she
danced
on
now
only
rhythms
her
body
dipping
and
whirling
her
arms
everywhere
at
once
her
smile
frozen
in
an
ecstatic
trance
forcing
himself
at
last
to
turn
away
he
looked
toward
the
musicians
they
seemed
entranced
by
her
as
well
captured
by
the
delirium
of
her
dance
he
finally
caught
the
eye
of
the
drummer
and
weakly
signaled
him
to
stop
but
the
man
stared
as
though
not
comprehending
spellbound
her
dance
had
now
grown
to
a
frenzy
surpassing
human
limits
summoning
his
last
strength
he
tried
to
pull
himself
up
off
the
bolster
but
he
discovered
his
legs
were
no
longer
his
own
the
room
had
become
a
whirling
pattern
of
color
and
sound
beyond
all
control
uncertainly
he
turned
and
began
to
feel
about
the
carpet
for
his
boots
his
grip
closed
about
a
sheath
of
soft
leather
and
he
probed
inside
there
strapped
and
still
loaded
was
his
remaining
pocket
pistol
shakily
he
took
it
in
his
hand
checked
the
prime
and
began
trying
to
aim
at
the
long
drum
resting
between
the
musicians
now
the
drum
seemed
to
drift
back
and
forth
in
his
vision
while
the
players
smiled
at
him
with
glazed
eyes
he
heard
a
hiss
and
felt
his
hand
fly
upward
as
though
unconnected
to
his
body
then
the
world
around
erupted
in
smoke
and
flying
splinters
of
wood
the
shot
had
been
timed
perfectly
with
the
end
of
a
rhythm
cycle
as
the
drum
exploded
into
fragments
on
the
sum
the
smoky
room
was
suddenly
gripped
in
silence
the
musicians
stared
wildly
for
a
moment
then
threw
themselves
face
down
on
the
carpet
pleading
in
unknown
words
needing
no
translation
hawksworth
looked
in
confusion
at
the
smoking
pistol
in
his
hand
not
recognizing
it
then
he
threw
it
onto
the
carpet
and
turned
toward
kamala
she
was
gazing
at
him
with
open
vacant
eyes
as
though
awakened
suddenly
from
a
powerful
dream
her
breath
was
coming
in
short
bursts
and
her
skin
seemed
afire
she
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
then
tried
to
move
toward
him
holding
out
her
arms
after
two
hesitant
steps
she
crumpled
to
the
carpet
when
he
bolted
upward
to
reach
for
her
the
servants
were
there
holding
him
back
you
must
not
touch
her
sahib
but
she
no
sahib
they
gripped
his
arms
tighter
ca
you
see
she
has
the
sickness
what
are
you
talking
about
it
began
late
today
in
the
bazaar
perhaps
they
do
not
know
of
it
yet
in
the
fort
at
first
no
one
realized
what
it
was
but
tonight
while
she
was
dancing
one
of
the
slaves
from
sharif
sahib
kitchen
came
to
tell
us
two
of
the
eunuchs
and
five
of
his
servants
have
become
very
sick
he
paused
to
look
at
kamala
i
think
she
must
have
known
that
is
why
she
wanted
to
dance
tonight
knew
what
what
did
she
know
the
plague
sahib
the
slave
who
came
said
that
the
plague
has
struck
all
over
agra
it
has
never
happened
in
india
before
the
servant
paused
it
is
the
will
of
allah
the
prophet
samad
foretold
it
now
it
has
come
hawksworth
turned
again
to
kamala
she
was
still
watching
him
with
empty
expressionless
eyes
as
though
her
life
had
just
poured
out
of
her
he
looked
down
at
her
for
a
moment
then
reached
for
a
pillow
and
carefully
slipped
it
beneath
her
head
her
lips
moved
as
she
tried
to
form
words
but
at
first
no
sound
came
then
as
though
again
finding
some
strength
beyond
herself
her
voice
came
in
a
whisper
did
you
see
what
did
you
see
him
the
great
god
shiva
he
came
tonight
and
danced
beside
me
did
you
see
his
beauty
she
paused
to
breathe
then
her
voice
rose
again
full
and
warm
he
was
as
i
knew
he
would
be
beautiful
beyond
telling
he
danced
in
a
ring
of
fire
with
his
hair
streaming
out
in
burning
strands
he
came
as
shiva
the
destroyer
but
his
dance
was
so
beautiful
so
very
very
beautiful
chapter
the
the
court
chronicles
of
his
imperial
on
the
day
of
the
of
the
month
of
dai
there
came
first
reports
of
the
pestilence
in
the
city
of
agra
on
this
day
over
five
hundred
people
were
stricken
the
first
signs
are
headache
and
fever
and
much
bleeding
at
the
nose
after
this
the
the
plague
buboes
form
under
the
armpits
or
in
the
groin
or
below
the
throat
the
infected
ones
turn
in
color
from
yellow
inclining
to
black
they
vomit
and
endure
much
high
fever
and
pain
and
then
they
die
if
one
in
a
household
contracts
the
pestilence
and
dies
others
in
the
same
house
inevitably
follow
after
traveling
the
same
road
of
annihilation
those
in
whom
the
buboes
appeared
if
they
call
another
person
for
water
to
drink
or
wash
will
also
infect
the
latter
with
the
sirayat
the
infection
it
has
come
to
pass
that
through
excessive
apprehension
none
will
minister
unto
those
infected
it
has
become
known
from
men
of
great
age
and
from
old
histories
that
this
disease
has
never
before
shown
itself
in
this
land
of
hindustan
many
physicians
and
learned
men
have
been
questioned
as
to
its
cause
some
say
it
has
come
because
there
has
been
drought
for
two
years
in
succession
others
say
it
is
owing
to
the
corruption
of
the
air
some
attribute
it
to
other
causes
the
infection
is
now
spreading
to
all
towns
and
villages
in
the
region
of
agra
save
one
the
noble
city
of
the
great
akman
fatehpur
wisdom
is
of
allah
and
all
men
must
submit

last
day
of

muharram
in
the
hijri

after
the
prophet
of
by

second
wazir
to
his
imperial
majesty
arangbar
brian
hawksworth
walked
slowly
up
worn
stone
steps
leading
from
the
riverside
funeral
ghats
the
pathway
was
narrow
crowded
and
lined
with
carved
statues
of
hindu
gods
a
god
with
human
form
and
the
head
of
an
elephant
a
god
with
a
lion
body
and
a
grotesquely
grinning
human
face
an
austere
deity
with
a
pointed
head
and
a
trident
in
his
hand
all
were
ancient
weathered
tame
monkeys
small
brown
malicious
chased
among
them
screeching
the
smoke
from
the
him
still
seared
in
his
lungs
only
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
steps
could
he
force
himself
to
look
back
scavenger
birds
wheeled
in
the
sky
above
and
small
barks
with
single
oarsmen
plied
the
muddy
face
of
the
jamuna
along
the
banks
were
toiling
washermen
untouchables
who
wore
nothing
save
a
brown
loincloth
and
a
kerchief
over
their
heads
they
stood
in
a
long
row
at
the
water
edge
mechanically
slapping
folded
lengths
of
cloth
against
stacks
of
flat
stones
they
seemed
unconcerned
by
the
nearness
of
the
funeral
ghats
stone
platforms
at
the
river
edge
that
were
built
out
above
the
steps
leading
down
into
the
water
as
he
silently
surveyed
the
crowd
around
him
from
somewhere
on
the
street
above
a
voice
chanted
a
funeral
litany
ram
nam
sach
hai
the
name
of
ram
is
truth
itself
it
had
taken
four
days
for
kamala
to
die
the
morning
after
she
had
danced
she
had
begun
to
show
unmistakable
symptoms
of
the
plague
she
had
called
for
brahmin
priests
and
seating
herself
on
a
wooden
plank
in
their
presence
had
removed
her
the
ear
pendants
that
were
the
mark
of
her
and
placed
them
together
with
twelve
gold
coins
on
the
plank
before
her
it
was
her
deconsecration
then
with
a
look
of
infinite
peace
she
had
announced
she
was
ready
to
die
next
she
informed
the
priests
that
since
she
had
no
sons
in
agra
no
family
at
all
she
wanted
brian
hawksworth
to
officiate
at
her
funeral
he
had
not
understood
what
she
wanted
until
the
servants
whispered
it
to
him
the
brahmins
had
been
scandalized
and
at
first
had
refused
to
agree
insisting
he
had
no
caste
and
consequently
was
a
despicable
untouchable
finally
after
more
payments
they
had
reluctantly
consented
then
she
had
turned
to
him
and
explained
what
she
had
done
when
he
tried
to
argue
she
had
appealed
to
him
in
the
name
of
shiva
i
only
ask
you
do
this
one
last
thing
for
me
she
had
said
going
on
to
insist
his
responsibilities
would
not
be
difficult
there
are
hindu
servants
in
the
palace
though
they
are
low
caste
they
know
enough
turki
to
guide
you
after
the
brahmins
had
departed
she
called
the
servants
and
as
hawksworth
watched
ordered
them
to
remove
all
her
jewels
from
the
rosewood
box
where
she
kept
them
then
she
asked
him
to
accompany
them
as
they
took
the
jewels
through
the
hindu
section
of
agra
to
a
temple
of
the
goddess
mari
who
presides
over
epidemics
they
were
to
donate
all
her
jewels
to
the
goddess
smiling
at
hawksworth
astonishment
she
had
explained
that
hindus
believe
a
person
reincarnation
is
directly
influenced
by
the
amount
of
alms
given
in
his
or
her
previous
life
this
last
act
of
charity
might
even
bring
her
back
as
a
brahmin
two
days
later
she
lapsed
into
a
delirium
of
fever
as
death
drew
near
the
hindu
servants
again
summoned
the
priests
to
visit
the
palace
the
plague
was
spreading
now
and
with
it
fear
and
at
first
none
had
been
willing
to
comply
only
after
it
was
agreed
that
they
would
be
paid
three
times
the
usual
price
for
the
ceremonies
did
the
brahmins
come
they
had
laid
kamala
body
on
a
bed
of
in
the
open
air
sprinkled
her
head
with
water
brought
from
the
sacred
ganges
river
and
smeared
her
brow
with
ganges
clay
she
had
seemed
only
vaguely
conscious
of
what
they
were
doing
when
at
last
she
died
her
body
was
immediately
washed
perfumed
and
bedecked
with
flowers
then
she
was
wrapped
in
linen
lifted
onto
a
bamboo
bier
and
carried
toward
the
river
ghats
by
the
hindu
servants
winding
through
the
streets
with
her
body
held
above
their
heads
intoning
a
funeral
dirge
hawksworth
had
led
the
procession
carrying
a
firepot
with
sacred
fire
provided
by
nadir
sharifs
hindu
servants
the
riverside
was
already
crowded
with
mourners
for
there
had
been
many
deaths
and
the
air
was
acrid
from
the
smoke
of
cremation
pyres
on
the
steps
above
the
ghats
was
a
row
of
thatch
umbrellas
and
sitting
on
a
reed
mat
beneath
each
was
a
brahmin
priest
all
were
shirtless
potbellied
and
wore
three
stripes
of
white
clay
down
their
forehead
in
honor
of
vishnu
trident
the
servants
approached
one
of
the
priests
and
began
to
bargain
with
him
after
a
time
the
man
rose
and
signified
agreement
the
servants
whispered
to
hawksworth
that
he
was
there
to
provide
funeral
rites
for
hire
adding
with
some
satisfaction
that
brahmins
who
served
at
the
ghats
were
despised
as
mercenaries
by
the
rest
of
their
caste
after
the
bargain
had
been
struck
the
priest
retired
beneath
his
umbrella
to
watch
while
they
purchased
logs
from
vendors
and
began
construction
of
a
pyre
when
finished
it
was
small
no
more
than
three
feet
high
and
irregular
but
no
one
seemed
to
care
satisfied
they
proceeded
to
douse
it
with
oil
then
the
brahmin
priest
was
summoned
from
his
umbrella
and
he
rose
and
came
down
the
steps
bowing
to
a
stone
shiva
lingam
as
he
passed
after
he
had
performed
a
short
ceremony
chanting
from
the
vedas
the
winding
sheet
was
cut
away
and
kamala
body
was
lifted
atop
the
stack
of
wood
a
mortal
sadness
had
swept
through
hawksworth
as
he
stood
holding
the
torch
listening
to
the
brahmin
chant
and
studying
the
flow
of
the
river
he
thought
again
of
kamala
of
the
times
he
had
secretly
admired
her
erotic
bearing
the
times
she
had
sat
patiently
explaining
how
best
to
draw
the
long
sensuous
notes
from
his
new
sitar
the
times
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
and
he
thought
again
of
their
last
evening
when
she
had
danced
with
the
power
of
a
god
when
at
last
he
moved
toward
the
bier
the
servants
had
touched
his
arm
and
pointed
him
toward
her
feet
explaining
that
only
if
the
deceased
were
a
man
could
the
pyre
be
lighted
at
the
head
the
logs
had
kindled
quickly
sending
out
the
sweet
smoke
of
soon
the
pyre
was
nothing
but
yellow
tongues
of
fire
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
glimpsed
her
once
more
in
among
the
flames
dancing
as
the
goddess
parvati
the
beloved
consort
of
shiva
when
he
turned
to
walk
away
the
servants
had
caught
his
sleeve
and
indicated
he
must
remain
as
her
son
it
was
his
duty
to
ensure
that
the
heat
burst
her
skull
releasing
her
soul
otherwise
he
would
have
to
do
it
himself
he
waited
the
smoke
drifting
over
him
astonished
that
a
religion
capable
of
the
beauty
of
her
dance
could
treat
death
with
such
barbarity
at
last
to
his
infinite
relief
the
servants
indicated
they
could
leave
they
gathered
up
the
pot
of
sacred
fire
and
took
his
arm
to
lead
him
away
it
was
then
he
had
pulled
away
wanting
to
be
alone
with
her
one
last
time
finally
no
longer
able
to
check
his
tears
he
had
turned
and
started
blindly
up
the
steps
alone
now
he
stared
numbly
back
as
though
awakened
from
a
nightmare
almost
without
thinking
he
searched
the
pocket
of
his
jerkin
until
his
fingers
closed
around
a
flask
of
brandy
he
drew
deeply
on
it
twice
before
turning
to
make
his
way
on
through
the
streets
of
agra
you
took
an
astonishing
risk
merely
to
honor
the
whims
of
your
hindu
dancer
ambassador
nadir
sharif
had
summoned
hawksworth
to
his
reception
room
at
sunset
few
men
here
would
have
done
it
i
lived
through
plagues
twice
before
in
over
ten
thousand
in
london
died
of
the
plague
and
in
in
the
summer
after
king
james
coronation
over
thirty
thousand
died
one
person
out
of
every
five
if
i
were
going
to
die
i
would
have
by
now
hawksworth
listened
to
his
own
bravado
and
wondered
if
it
sounded
as
hollow
as
it
was
he
remembered
his
own
haunting
fear
during
the
height
of
the
last
plague
when
rowdy
swearing
bearers
rogues
some
declared
more
than
hangmen
plied
the
city
with
rented
barrows
their
cries
of
cast
out
your
dead
ringing
through
the
deserted
streets
they
charged
sixpence
a
corpse
and
for
their
fee
they
carted
the
bodies
to
open
pits
at
the
city
edge
for
unconsecrated
anonymous
burial
the
cutpurse
and
the
alderman
piled
side
by
side
as
he
remembered
london
again
suddenly
the
hindu
rites
seemed
considerably
less
barbaric
you
a
brave
man
nonetheless
or
a
foolish
one
nadir
sharif
gestured
him
toward
a
bolster
tell
me
have
your
english
physicians
determined
the
cause
of
the
infection
there
are
many
theories
the
puritans
say
it
god
vengeance
and
astrologers
point
out
that
there
was
a
conjunction
of
the
planets
jupiter
and
saturn
when
the
last
plague
struck
but
our
physicians
seem
to
have
two
main
theories
some
hold
it
caused
by
an
excess
of
corrupt
humors
in
the
body
whereas
others
claim
it
spread
by
poisonous
air
which
has
taken
up
vapors
contrary
to
nature
nadir
sharif
sat
pensive
and
silent
for
a
moment
as
though
pondering
the
explanations
then
he
turned
to
hawksworth
what
you
seem
to
have
told
me
is
that
your
physicians
have
absolutely
no
idea
what
causes
the
plague
so
they
have
very
ingeniously
invented
names
for
the
main
points
of
their
ignorance
he
smiled
indian
physicians
have
been
known
to
do
the
same
tell
me
then
what
do
you
think
causes
it
i
do
know
either
it
seems
to
worsen
in
the
years
after
crops
have
been
bad
when
there
are
hungry
dogs
and
rats
scavenging
in
the
streets
during
the
last
plague
all
the
dogs
in
london
were
killed
or
sent
out
of
the
city
but
it
did
seem
to
help
and
what
about
the
rats
there
always
been
men
in
england
who
make
a
living
as
but
with
the
dogs
gone
during
the
plague
the
rats
naturally
started
to
multiply
nadir
smiled
thoughtfully
you
know
the
hindus
have
a
book
the
bhagavata
parana
that
warns
men
to
quit
their
house
if
they
see
a
sickly
rat
near
it
indians
have
long
assumed
vermin
bring
disease
have
you
considered
the
possibility
that
the
source
of
the
plague
might
be
the
rats
rather
than
the
dogs
perhaps
by
removing
the
dogs
you
eliminated
the
best
deterrent
to
the
bearer
of
the
plague
the
rats
no
one
has
thought
of
that
well
the
european
plague
has
finally
reached
india
whatever
its
cause
nadir
sharif
looked
away
gloomily
almost
a
hundred
people
died
in
agra
this
past
week
our
physicians
are
still
searching
for
a
cure
what
remedies
do
you
use
in
england
i
think
his
majesty
would
be
most
interested
to
know
i
suppose
the
measures
are
more
general
than
specific
englishmen
try
to
ward
it
off
by
purging
the
pestilent
air
around
them
they
burn
rosemary
and
juniper
and
bay
leaves
in
their
homes
during
the
last
plague
the
price
of
rosemary
went
up
from
twelve
pence
an
armful
to
six
shillings
a
handful
but
the
only
people
helped
seemed
to
be
herb
wives
and
gardeners
one
physician
claimed
the
plague
could
be
avoided
by
wearing
a
bag
of
arsenic
next
to
the
skin
there
also
a
belief
that
if
you
bury
half
a
dozen
peeled
onions
near
your
home
they
gather
all
the
infection
in
the
neighborhood
and
some
people
fumigate
the
contagious
vapors
from
their
rooms
by
dropping
a
brick
into
a
basin
of
vinegar
do
these
curious
nostrums
work
nadir
sharif
tried
to
mask
his
skepticism
i
suppose
it
possible
who
can
say
for
sure
but
the
plague
always
diminishes
after
a
time
usually
with
the
onset
of
winter
does
your
king
do
anything
he
usually
leaves
london
if
an
infection
starts
to
spread
in
the
year
of
his
coronation
he
first
went
to
richmond
then
to
southampton
then
to
wilton
he
traveled
all
summer
and
only
returned
in
the
autumn
is
that
all
he
did
travel
there
were
plague
orders
in
all
the
infected
towns
and
any
house
where
someone
was
infected
had
to
have
a
red
cross
painted
on
the
door
and
a
plague
bill
attached
no
one
inside
could
leave
anyone
caught
outside
was
whipped
and
set
in
the
stocks
and
did
these
measures
help
englishmen
resent
being
told
they
ca
leave
home
so
people
would
tear
the
plague
bills
off
their
doors
and
go
about
their
business
some
towns
hired
warders
at
sixpence
a
day
to
watch
the
houses
and
make
sure
no
one
left
but
when
so
many
are
infected
it
impossible
to
watch
everyone
so
there
were
also
orders
forbidding
assemblies
king
james
banned
the
holding
of
fairs
within
fifty
miles
of
london
and
all
gatherings
in
london
were
prohibited
by
a
city
order
playhouses
gaming
houses
cockpits
bowling
football
even
ballad
singers
were
told
to
stay
off
the
streets
his
majesty
may
find
that
interesting
nadir
sharif
turned
and
signaled
for
the
servants
perhaps
he
should
issue
laws
forbidding
assembly
before
he
leaves
agra
is
he
leaving
hawksworth
felt
his
heart
stop
day
after
tomorrow
nadir
sharif
watched
as
the
tray
of
arrived
and
immediately
directed
it
toward
hawksworth
i
have
to
see
him
one
last
time
before
he
leaves
before
i
leave
i
really
think
that
impossible
now
he
canceled
the
daily
no
one
can
see
him
even
i
have
difficulty
meeting
with
him
nadir
sharif
accepted
a
cup
from
the
tray
and
examined
hawksworth
sorrowfully
as
he
sipped
it
in
any
case
i
fear
a
meeting
would
do
you
little
good
ambassador
he
busy
arranging
the
departure
for
all
the
court
including
the
there
are
thousands
of
people
to
move
and
on
very
short
notice
in
fact
i
been
trying
to
see
her
majesty
for
several
days
but
she
has
received
no
one
he
smiled
evenly
not
even
her
own
brother
where
his
majesty
planning
to
go
not
so
very
far
actually
ordinarily
he
probably
would
travel
north
toward
kashmir
but
since
winter
is
approaching
decided
to
go
west
to
fatehpur
sekri
the
area
around
the
old
palace
has
remained
free
of
the
infection
but
i
have
to
see
him
hawksworth
hesitated
do
you
know
happened
to
shirin
nothing
so
far
as
i
hear
i
believe
she
still
being
held
in
the
fort
nadir
sharif
studied
hawksworth
but
i
would
advise
you
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
to
avoid
meddling
in
the
business
of
that
persian
adventuress
and
her
departed
sufi
heretic
what
i
do
is
my
affair
hawksworth
set
down
his
cup
harder
than
necessary
i
insist
on
seeing
his
majesty
i
want
you
to
arrange
it
but
a
formal
meeting
is
really
quite
impossible
ambassador
have
i
made
that
clear
nadir
sharif
paused
to
collect
his
poise
but
perhaps
if
you
appeared
when
his
entourage
is
departing
agra
you
might
be
able
to
speak
with
him
i
have
to
insist
however
that
a
meeting
now
would
be
pointless
and
possibly
even
dangerous
considering
his
majesty
disposition
at
the
moment
i
see
him
before
he
leaves
somehow
i
find
a
way
then
i
wish
you
godspeed
ambassador
nadir
sharif
put
down
his
incidentally
there
a
large
caravan
leaving
for
surat
day
after
tomorrow
should
i
make
arrangements
for
you
to
join
it
i
not
going
anywhere
until
i
see
the
moghul
you
a
headstrong
man
ambassador
please
believe
i
wish
you
well
notwithstanding
his
majesty
current
views
i
always
regarded
you
highly
he
signaled
for
a
tray
of
betel
leaves
and
rose
flashing
one
of
his
official
smiles
who
knows
perhaps
your
luck
is
due
for
a
change
queen
janahara
read
the
dispatch
twice
the
lines
of
her
mouth
growing
tighter
each
time
before
passing
it
back
to
arangbar
he
studied
it
again
holding
it
with
a
trembling
hand
seeming
not
to
fully
comprehend
its
meaning
then
extended
it
to
nadir
sharif
the
courtyard
off
arangbar
private
library
was
deadly
silent
all
servants
and
eunuchs
banished
the
tapestries
shading
the
inner
compartment
had
been
drawn
back
permitting
the
hard
light
of
morning
to
illuminate
the
flowered
murals
on
the
library
red
sandstone
walls
arangbar
sipped
wine
from
a
gilded
cup
and
studied
nadir
sharifs
face
while
the
prime
minister
read
as
though
hoping
somehow
to
decipher
the
significance
from
his
expression
he
has
plainly
refused
majesty
nadir
sharifs
voice
was
strangely
calm
when
did
this
arrive
this
morning
it
his
reply
to
the
pigeon
i
sent
to
burhanpur
the
day
after
the
wedding
ordering
him
to
return
the
command
in
the
south
to
ghulam
adl
and
march
to
the
northwest
to
relieve
the
fortress
at
qandahar
arangbar
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
grim
at
least
we
know
now
where
he
is
we
know
nothing
janahara
reached
for
the
document
and
scrutinized
it
this
dispatch
was
sent
four
days
ago
he
could
be
as
far
north
as
mandu
by
now
or
well
on
his
way
to
agra
i
doubt
very
much
he
will
march
anywhere
nadir
sharif
cut
her
off
without
seeming
to
do
so
until
he
receives
a
response
to
the
terms
he
has
demanded
repeat
them
to
me
arangbar
was
having
difficulty
focusing
on
the
wine
cup
and
he
shifted
his
gaze
into
the
courtyard
they
are
very
explicit
majesty
nadir
sharif
rolled
the
document
and
replaced
it
in
the
bamboo
sleeve
jadar
has
refused
to
march
to
defend
qandahar
unless
his
horse
rank
is
raised
to
thirty
thousand
and
unless
the
dholpur
those
that
were
granted
to
prince
allaudin
are
returned
what
will
you
do
there
can
be
no
bargaining
with
an
imperial
order
queen
janahara
interjected
how
many
times
will
you
be
intimidated
remember
he
refused
to
undertake
this
campaign
which
i
should
add
he
has
apparently
bungled
until
his
was
elevated
and
his
elder
brother
khusrav
was
sent
out
of
agra
when
will
his
demands
end
her
voice
rose
even
now
we
do
not
know
what
has
happened
all
we
know
for
sure
is
that
two
months
ago
he
marched
south
from
burhanpur
and
four
days
ago
he
was
there
again
was
he
driven
back
when
he
tried
to
recapture
ahmadnagar
from
malik
ambar
does
the
deccan
still
belong
to
the
abyssinian
prince
jadar
has
much
to
answer
but
the
dispatch
was
sent
from
burhanpur
at
least
he
has
abandoned
the
city
entirely
as
some
of
the
rumors
said
nadir
sharif
continued
evenly
and
i
do
believe
he
has
abandoned
the
south
either
he
would
not
permit
it
to
remain
in
rebel
hands
whatever
else
he
is
a
soldier
first
for
all
we
know
he
is
now
isolated
at
the
fortress
in
burhanpur
janahara
studied
the
empty
courtyard
if
he
has
not
already
lost
the
city
so
what
do
you
propose
be
done
arangbar
voice
was
slurred
as
he
sipped
from
his
cup
there
only
one
choice
remaining
if
you
ever
hope
to
control
jadar
she
spoke
directly
to
arangbar
order
inayat
latif
to
mobilize
the
imperial
army
and
march
south
now
we
have
to
know
what
happening
there
inayat
latif
is
a
far
abler
general
than
jadar
he
at
least
can
ensure
the
deccan
is
secure
then
we
can
handle
the
matter
of
jadar
demands
but
that
could
also
give
the
appearance
the
imperial
army
is
marching
against
jadar
nadir
sharif
shifted
uncomfortably
he
will
see
it
as
an
ultimatum
do
you
really
think
he
will
respond
to
threats
you
must
know
him
better
than
that
i
know
him
all
too
well
janahara
voice
was
hard
your
majesty
nadir
sharif
turned
directly
to
the
queen
perhaps
if
he
is
given
more
time
he
will
come
to
better
appreciate
his
position
i
suggest
the
first
thing
we
do
is
request
a
clarification
of
the
military
situation
throughout
the
deccan
then
we
can
send
the
imperial
army
as
reinforcements
if
it
still
seems
advisable
i
growing
weary
of
constantly
trying
to
outguess
jadar
arangbar
examined
his
cup
and
noted
gloomily
that
it
was
dry
first
the
plague
and
now
the
preparations
for
the
move
i
exhausted
when
do
we
depart
i
told
the
last
of
the
elephants
will
be
ready
within
one
majesty
nadir
sharif
studied
the
queen
casually
wondering
how
far
she
would
push
her
influence
with
arangbar
i
agree
with
you
it
would
be
wisest
to
wait
if
you
insist
on
doing
nothing
at
least
the
imperial
army
should
be
mobilized
and
made
ready
janahara
dulcet
voice
was
betrayed
by
the
quick
flash
in
her
eyes
then
jadar
will
understand
we
are
prepared
to
act
quickly
if
he
remains
defiant
how
many
men
and
horse
does
inayat
latif
have
under
his
command
now
arangbar
searched
the
darkened
recesses
behind
them
for
a
servant
to
summon
with
more
wine
there
are
over
a
hundred
thousand
men
here
majesty
and
probably
fifty
thousand
cavalry
over
three
times
the
force
jadar
took
with
him
to
the
south
nadir
sharif
paused
they
could
always
move
out
within
say
two
to
three
weeks
i
insist
the
forces
here
at
least
be
mobilized
and
moved
to
fatehpur
with
the
court
lest
the
army
itself
become
contaminated
by
the
plague
janahara
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
evenly
i
prepared
to
order
it
in
your
name
today
it
would
protect
the
army
from
infection
you
would
have
them
with
you
if
you
needed
them
and
it
would
also
put
jadar
on
notice
then
prepare
the
orders
for
my
seal
if
it
pleases
you
arangbar
sighed
and
reached
for
his
turban
you
usually
right
you
know
i
right
she
smiled
warmly
and
regardless
no
harm
will
be
done
then
it
settled
arangbar
tried
unsuccessfully
to
rise
and
nadir
sharif
stepped
forward
assisting
him
to
his
feet
i
have
to
hold
last
time
today
quickly
before
we
leave
the
persian
safavid
ambassador
notified
the
has
gifts
and
a
petition
that
must
be
brought
to
me
before
the
court
leaves
agra
he
grinned
the
safavis
are
so
worried
i
will
form
an
alliance
with
the
northwestern
uzbeks
that
their
emperor
shah
abbas
sends
gifts
every
month
you
decided
to
hold
after
all
nadir
sharifs
eyes
quickened
if
so
there
a
portuguese
official
from
surat
who
also
wishes
to
present
some
gifts
from
the
viceroy
and
speak
with
you
on
a
matter
he
said
was
delicate
what
matter
does
his
excellency
have
janahara
stopped
sharply
on
her
way
toward
the
corridor
and
turned
back
i
heard
nothing
about
it
i
suppose
we
all
discover
that
in
majesty
nadir
sharif
bowed
and
was
gone
brian
hawksworth
waited
in
the
crowded
square
of
the
holding
a
large
package
and
hoping
the
rumored
appearance
of
arangbar
was
true
for
the
past
four
days
the
moghul
had
not
held
had
remained
in
complete
isolation
but
only
an
hour
before
talk
had
circulated
in
the
square
that
arangbar
would
hold
a
brief
reception
before
departing
probably
in
a
tent
pavilion
that
had
been
erected
in
the
center
of
the
square
as
though
to
verify
the
speculation
slaves
had
unrolled
several
thick
carpets
beneath
the
tent
installed
a
dais
and
were
now
positioning
his
throne
onto
the
platform
hawksworth
stared
about
the
square
and
felt
his
palms
sweat
is
this
the
last
time
i
ever
see
the
moghul
of
india
and
shirin
never
again
is
this
how
it
ends
he
had
spent
the
last
several
days
in
a
private
hell
thinking
of
shirin
and
waiting
for
the
first
fever
the
first
nodules
that
would
signal
the
plague
so
far
there
had
been
no
signs
of
the
disease
and
he
had
heard
that
the
consensus
in
the
bazaar
was
the
infection
would
subside
within
the
month
clearly
it
would
be
nothing
like
london
in
palace
rumors
said
that
shirin
was
still
alive
all
executions
had
ceased
after
the
appearance
of
the
plague
and
stories
were
that
the
moghul
was
rarely
seen
sober
perhaps
hawksworth
told
himself
arangbar
has
stayed
so
drunk
he
has
forgotten
her
he
had
finally
conceived
one
last
plan
to
try
to
save
her
then
he
had
packed
his
chest
settled
his
accounts
and
dismissed
his
servants
if
nothing
came
of
the
meeting
today
if
there
was
a
meeting
he
would
have
to
leave
in
any
case
he
moved
closer
to
the
royal
pavilion
pushing
his
way
through
the
melee
of
shirtless
servants
the
elephants
for
the
been
moved
into
the
square
and
were
now
being
readied
there
were
by
hawksworth
rough
count
approximately
a
hundred
elephants
to
carry
arangbar
women
the
the
main
wives
were
fashioned
from
gold
with
gratings
of
gold
wire
around
the
sides
to
provide
a
view
and
an
umbrella
canopy
of
silver
cloth
for
shade
a
special
elephant
was
waiting
for
queen
janahara
and
princess
layla
decorated
with
a
canvas
of
gold
brocade
and
bearing
a
as
hawksworth
watched
another
elephant
shining
with
black
paint
and
the
largest
he
had
ever
seen
lumbered
regally
into
the
square
ridden
by
a
mahout
with
a
turban
its
covering
was
even
more
lavish
than
that
of
the
queen
mount
and
its
emblazoned
with
the
imperial
standard
of
arangbar
a
lion
crouching
menacingly
in
front
of
a
golden
sun
face
beneath
the
verandas
rows
of
saddled
horses
waited
for
the
lesser
members
of
the
court
each
with
a
slave
stationed
alongside
bearing
an
umbrella
of
gold
cloth
and
in
front
of
the
horses
were
rows
of
palanquins
their
velvet
gleaming
in
the
light
ready
for
high
officials
the
roadway
leading
from
the
square
of
the
been
lined
with
a
guard
of
three
hundred
male
war
elephants
each
with
a
cannon
turret
on
its
back
behind
those
three
hundred
female
elephants
stood
idling
in
the
sunshine
their
backs
covered
with
gold
cloth
marked
with
the
moghurs
insignia
waiting
to
be
loaded
with
household
goods
from
the
just
beyond
the
gate
a
host
of
watermen
were
poised
with
waterskins
slung
from
their
backs
ready
to
run
before
the
procession
sprinkling
the
roadway
to
banish
dust
near
them
a
small
party
of
men
stood
holding
the
harness
of
a
camel
bearing
a
roll
of
white
cloth
used
to
cover
and
banish
from
sight
any
dead
animals
that
might
lie
along
the
route
of
the
moghuls
party
the
courtyard
erupted
with
a
sudden
blare
of
trumpets
and
kettledrums
and
hawksworth
turned
to
see
arangbar
being
carried
in
on
an
open
palanquin
supported
by
uniformed
eunuchs
a
slave
walked
along
one
side
holding
a
satin
umbrella
over
his
head
for
shade
while
on
the
other
two
chubby
eunuchs
walked
fanning
him
with
sprays
of
peacock
feathers
attached
to
long
poles
as
the
palanquin
neared
the
tent
hawksworth
pushed
through
the
crowd
to
gain
a
better
view
arangbar
was
dressed
for
a
ceremonial
occasion
wearing
a
velvet
turban
with
a
plume
of
white
almost
two
feet
in
length
a
ruby
dangled
from
one
side
of
the
turban
and
on
the
other
side
was
a
massive
diamond
paired
with
a
emerald
around
his
turban
was
a
sash
wreathed
with
a
chain
of
pearls
rings
bearing
flashing
jewels
decorated
every
finger
and
his
cloak
was
gold
brocade
decorated
with
jeweled
armlets
as
he
descended
from
the
palanquin
at
the
entry
of
the
pavilion
the
nobles
near
him
yelled
padshah
salamat
long
live
the
emperor
and
performed
the
as
he
moved
toward
his
throne
two
more
eunuchs
were
waiting
one
stepped
forward
and
presented
an
enormous
pink
carp
on
a
silver
tray
while
the
other
held
out
a
dish
of
starchy
white
liquid
arangbar
dipped
his
finger
in
the
liquid
touched
it
to
the
fish
then
rubbed
his
own
forehead
a
moghul
ceremony
presaging
good
omens
for
a
march
next
another
eunuch
stepped
forward
bowed
and
presented
him
with
a
sword
he
stared
at
it
for
a
moment
as
though
confused
then
shakily
ran
his
finger
along
the
diamonds
set
in
the
scabbard
and
the
braided
gold
belt
as
the
eunuch
urged
it
toward
him
he
nodded
and
allowed
it
to
be
buckled
at
his
waist
another
eunuch
then
presented
him
with
a
golden
quiver
containing
thin
bamboo
arrows
and
a
gleaming
lacquer
bow
as
he
mounted
the
dais
two
eunuchs
moved
to
his
side
each
waving
a
tail
of
white
yak
hair
intended
to
drive
away
flies
another
fanfare
of
trumpets
and
drums
cut
the
air
as
the
eunuchs
helped
him
onto
the
throne
only
when
arangbar
was
seated
did
hawksworth
notice
that
nadir
sharif
and
zainul
beg
were
already
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
he
also
noted
queen
janahara
was
not
present
and
then
he
realized
why
the
servants
had
neglected
to
erect
her
screen
the
one
she
normally
sat
behind
to
dictate
his
decisions
since
the
appearance
of
arangbar
solitary
rule
still
had
to
be
maintained
she
could
not
be
seen
publicly
issuing
orders
at
least
not
yet
hawksworth
smiled
to
himself
wondering
whose
head
would
roll
for
the
oversight
then
as
he
watched
nadir
sharif
begin
explaining
petitions
to
arangbar
he
thought
he
sensed
a
gleam
of
triumph
in
the
prime
minister
eye
could
it
be
the
failure
to
install
a
screen
was
deliberate
the
persian
safavid
ambassador
approached
with
the
obligatory
gift
this
time
an
ornamental
case
containing
a
ruby
on
a
gold
chain
and
then
handed
up
a
paper
arangbar
listened
to
nadir
sharif
explain
the
document
then
appeared
to
ponder
it
a
moment
finally
he
waved
his
arms
lightly
and
agreed
to
something
hawksworth
did
not
catch
the
ambassador
bowed
his
appreciation
revolved
with
enormous
dignity
and
retreated
into
the
sunshine
arangbar
was
already
beginning
to
grow
restless
clearly
anxious
to
dismiss
everyone
and
begin
loading
the
onto
their
elephants
he
turned
and
spoke
to
nadir
sharif
who
replied
quickly
and
motioned
toward
a
portuguese
emissary
in
a
starched
doublet
who
stood
waiting
together
with
father
sarmento
it
was
the
first
time
hawksworth
had
noticed
them
and
he
felt
his
gut
knot
in
hatred
as
he
shoved
his
own
way
forward
toward
the
pavilion
arangbar
listened
with
a
glazed
expression
nodding
occasionally
as
the
portuguese
emissary
delivered
an
elaborate
speech
translated
by
sarmento
and
began
laying
out
the
contents
of
a
chest
he
carried
with
theatrical
flair
he
drew
out
several
large
silver
candlesticks
a
brace
of
handled
knives
with
sheaths
a
dozen
wine
cups
of
venetian
crystal
then
he
produced
a
leather
packet
with
a
red
wax
seal
he
spoke
a
few
more
words
and
passed
it
to
nadir
sharif
the
prime
minister
examined
it
broke
the
seal
to
extract
the
parchment
then
gestured
for
sarmento
to
come
forward
to
translate
the
jesuit
suddenly
looked
very
old
and
very
uneasy
as
he
adjusted
his
peaked
black
hat
and
took
the
paper
hawksworth
shoved
closer
and
for
the
first
time
arangbar
seemed
to
notice
him
the
moghul
eyes
darkened
and
he
started
to
say
something
in
hawksworth
direction
but
sarmento
had
already
begun
the
translation
into
turki
his
excellency
miguel
vaijantes
sends
this
message
of
his
high
regard
and
everlasting
friendship
for
his
most
high
majesty
the
great
moghul
of
india
he
bows
before
you
and
hopes
you
will
honor
him
by
accepting
these
few
small
tokens
of
his
admiration
sarmento
shifted
and
cleared
his
throat
arangbar
eyes
had
fluttered
partially
closed
and
his
head
seemed
to
nod
sleepily
at
the
conventional
flattery
his
excellency
asks
your
majesty
indulgence
of
a
grievous
misdeed
last
week
by
a
captain
of
one
of
our
patrol
vessels
he
assures
your
majesty
that
the
captain
will
be
stripped
of
all
rank
and
returned
in
chains
to
goa
within
the
month
arangbar
eyes
had
again
opened
and
he
shifted
slightly
on
the
throne
what
is
referred
to
sarmento
looked
at
the
emissary
who
quickly
replied
in
portuguese
the
jesuit
turned
again
to
arangbar
your
majesty
will
doubtless
receive
a
dispatch
from
surat
within
a
short
time
describing
an
unfortunate
incident
his
excellency
wants
you
to
understand
in
advance
that
it
was
a
mistaken
order
undertaken
entirely
without
his
knowledge
or
approval
arangbar
was
fully
awake
now
and
staring
down
at
the
two
portuguese
what
order
did
the
viceroy
order
something
he
now
wishes
to
disown
what
was
it
it
the
unfortunate
matter
of
the
your
majesty
sarmento
turned
helplessly
toward
the
portuguese
emissary
as
though
he
too
were
searching
for
an
explanation
what
about
the
she
my
largest
cargo
vessel
she
due
in
surat
in
two
days
with
goods
from
persia
arangbar
face
was
sober
now
her
highness
maryam
zamani
had
eighty
rupees
the
is
safe
your
majesty
she
has
only
been
detained
at
sea
on
a
mistaken
interpretation
of
his
excellency
orders
sarmento
seemed
to
be
blurting
out
the
words
but
he
wishes
to
assure
you
impossible
arangbar
voice
was
suddenly
a
roar
he
would
not
dare
he
knows
the
cargo
was
under
my
seal
i
have
a
copy
of
the
cartaz
sent
to
goa
it
was
a
grievous
mistake
majesty
his
excellency
sends
his
deepest
apologies
and
offers
to
it
was
done
on
it
had
to
be
his
how
can
it
be
a
arangbar
face
had
gone
purple
why
was
it
ordered
in
the
first
place
sarmento
stood
speechless
while
the
envoy
spoke
rapidly
into
his
ear
then
he
looked
back
at
arangbar
mistakes
are
always
possible
majesty
his
excellency
wishes
to
assure
you
the
vessel
and
all
cargo
will
be
released
within
two
weeks
i
demand
it
be
released
immediately
and
damages
equal
the
value
of
the
cargo
brought
to
me
personally
arangbar
face
was
livid
or
he
will
never
again
have
a
trade
in
an
indian
port
sarmento
turned
and
translated
quickly
to
the
emissary
the
portuguese
face
dropped
over
his
moustache
and
he
hesitantly
spoke
something
to
sarmento
we
regret
we
have
no
power
at
this
time
to
authorize
a
payment
for
damages
majesty
but
we
assure
you
his
excellency
will
then
excellency
will
have
no
more
trade
in
india
arangbar
turned
his
face
overflowing
with
rage
and
shouted
to
the
guards
standing
behind
him
as
they
ran
to
his
side
he
drew
his
sword
and
waved
it
drunkenly
at
the
emissary
whose
face
had
gone
white
take
him
away
as
the
guards
seized
the
terrified
portuguese
by
the
arms
sending
his
hat
tumbling
onto
the
carpet
he
looked
imploringly
at
nadir
sharif
but
the
prime
minister
face
was
a
mask
then
arangbar
turned
on
father
sarmento
if
his
excellency
has
anything
else
to
say
to
me
he
will
say
it
himself
or
he
will
send
someone
with
the
authority
to
answer
me
i
do
not
receive
his
sarmento
flinched
at
the
insulting
goan
slang
for
dockhand
your
majesty
again
i
assure
you
you
will
never
again
assure
me
of
anything
i
listened
to
your
assurances
for
years
largely
on
matters
about
which
you
have
only
belief
never
proof
you
assured
me
of
the
power
of
the
christian
god
but
never
once
would
you
accept
the
challenge
of
the
islamic
mullahs
to
cast
a
bible
and
the
quran
into
a
fire
together
to
show
once
and
for
all
which
held
sacred
truth
but
their
test
is
no
longer
needed
your
christian
lies
are
over
arangbar
rose
unsteadily
from
his
throne
his
brow
harrowed
by
his
fury
i
order
your
stipend
terminated
and
your
church
in
agra
closed
and
your
mission
in
lahore
there
will
never
again
be
a
christian
church
in
india
never
your
majesty
there
are
many
christians
in
india
sarmento
voice
was
pleading
they
must
have
a
priest
to
minister
the
holy
sacrament
then
do
it
in
your
lodgings
you
no
longer
have
a
church
arangbar
settled
back
on
the
throne
his
anger
seeming
to
overwhelm
him
never
see
me
again
unless
you
bring
news
the
ship
is
released
and
my
demands
met
never
sarmento
watched
in
horror
as
arangbar
dismissed
him
with
a
gesture
of
his
arm
the
old
jesuit
turned
and
moved
trembling
into
the
crowd
that
had
pushed
around
the
sides
of
the
pavilion
as
he
passed
by
hawksworth
he
suddenly
stopped
this
was
all
because
of
you
his
voice
quivered
i
learned
of
this
only
today
from
my
foolish
prodigal
pinheiro
may
god
have
mercy
on
you
heretic
you
and
your
accomplices
have
destroyed
all
his
work
in
india
as
hawksworth
tried
to
find
an
answer
he
heard
a
drunken
shout
inglish
what
are
you
doing
here
come
forward
and
explain
yourself
he
looked
up
to
see
arangbar
motioning
at
him
are
you
deaf
come
forward
arangbar
glared
mischievously
why
are
you
still
in
agra
we
were
told
we
sent
you
away
almost
a
week
ago
i
think
i
may
decide
to
have
you
and
every
other
christian
in
india
hanged
may
it
please
your
majesty
i
came
to
request
an
audience
hawksworth
moved
quickly
forward
past
the
confused
guards
carrying
the
package
he
had
brought
and
what
have
you
stolen
of
ours
inglish
have
you
come
now
to
tell
us
it
was
all
a
mistake
before
i
order
your
hand
cut
off
englishmen
are
not
portugals
your
majesty
we
do
not
take
what
is
not
our
own
what
have
i
ever
taken
that
your
majesty
did
not
freely
give
it
true
what
you
say
inglish
you
are
not
a
portuguese
arangbar
suddenly
beamed
as
a
thought
flashed
through
his
eyes
tell
me
inglish
will
your
king
destroy
their
fleets
for
me
now
why
would
he
do
so
your
majesty
you
have
denied
him
the
right
to
trade
you
have
refused
to
grant
the
requested
not
if
he
will
rout
the
portuguese
infidels
from
our
seas
inglish
they
are
a
pestilence
a
plague
that
sickens
all
it
touches
arangbar
waved
in
the
direction
of
a
eunuch
ordering
wine
for
himself
you
deceived
me
once
inglish
but
you
did
not
rob
me
perhaps
we
will
have
you
stay
here
a
few
days
longer
i
have
already
made
preparations
to
depart
your
majesty
on
your
orders
you
can
not
travel
without
our
permission
inglish
we
still
rule
india
despite
what
the
portuguese
viceroy
may
think
arangbar
paused
and
drank
thirstily
from
the
glass
of
wine
so
why
did
you
want
an
audience
inglish
if
you
were
planning
to
leave
hawksworth
paused
thinking
of
the
decision
he
had
made
wondering
again
if
there
was
a
chance
i
come
to
make
a
trifling
request
of
your
majesty
he
moved
forward
and
bowed
presenting
his
parcel
the
obligatory
gift
what
this
have
you
brought
us
inglish
may
it
please
your
majesty
after
settling
my
accounts
in
agra
i
have
no
money
remaining
to
purchase
gifts
worthy
of
your
majesty
i
have
only
this
remaining
i
offer
it
to
your
majesty
in
hopes
you
will
understand
its
unworthiness
in
your
eyes
is
matched
only
by
its
unequaled
value
to
me
it
is
my
treasure
i
have
had
it
by
my
side
for
over
twenty
years
at
sea
and
on
land
arangbar
accepted
the
parcel
with
curiosity
and
flipped
aside
the
velvet
wrap
an
english
lute
sparkled
against
the
sunshine
what
is
this
inglish
arangbar
turned
it
in
his
hand
examining
the
polished
cedar
staves
that
curved
to
form
its
back
an
instrument
of
england
your
majesty
which
we
hold
in
the
same
esteem
you
grant
your
indian
sitar
this
is
a
curious
toy
inglish
it
has
so
few
strings
he
examined
it
a
moment
longer
then
turned
to
hawksworth
do
you
yourself
play
this
instrument
i
do
your
majesty
then
we
will
hear
it
arangbar
passed
the
lute
back
to
hawksworth
while
the
nobles
around
them
buzzed
in
astonishment
hawksworth
cradled
it
against
him
the
feel
of
its
body
flooded
him
with
sadness
as
he
realized
he
would
never
play
it
again
memories
of
london
tunis
gibraltar
a
dozen
cabins
and
lodgings
flooded
over
him
he
inhaled
deeply
and
began
a
short
suite
by
dowland
it
was
the
one
he
had
played
for
shirin
that
afternoon
so
long
ago
in
the
observatory
in
surat
the
clear
notes
flooded
the
canopied
pavilion
with
their
rich
full
voice
then
drifted
outward
into
the
square
settling
silence
in
their
path
the
suite
was
melancholy
a
lament
of
lost
love
and
beauty
and
hawksworth
found
his
own
eyes
misting
as
he
played
when
he
reached
the
end
the
last
crisp
note
died
into
a
void
that
seemed
to
be
his
own
heart
he
held
the
lute
a
moment
longer
then
turned
to
pass
it
back
to
arangbar
the
moghul
eyes
seemed
to
be
misting
as
well
i
have
never
heard
anything
quite
like
it
inglish
it
has
a
sadness
we
never
hear
in
a
raga
why
have
you
never
played
for
us
before
your
majesty
has
musicians
of
your
own
but
no
instrument
like
this
inglish
will
you
have
your
king
send
us
one
but
i
have
given
you
mine
majesty
arangbar
examined
the
lute
once
more
then
looked
at
hawksworth
and
smiled
but
if
i
keep
this
instrument
now
inglish
i
will
most
probably
forget
by
tomorrow
where
i
have
put
it
he
winked
at
hawksworth
and
handed
back
the
lute
have
your
king
send
us
one
inglish
and
a
teacher
to
instruct
our
musicians
hawksworth
could
not
believe
what
he
was
hearing
i
humbly
thank
your
majesty
i
now
what
was
it
you
came
to
ask
of
us
inglish
arangbar
continued
to
study
the
lute
as
he
sipped
from
his
wine
ask
it
quickly
merely
a
trifling
indulgence
of
your
majesty
then
tell
us
what
it
is
inglish
arangbar
turned
and
searched
the
square
with
his
eyes
as
though
monitoring
the
state
of
preparations
hawksworth
cleared
his
throat
and
tried
to
still
his
pulse
your
majesty
release
of
the
persian
woman
shirin
who
is
guilty
of
no
crime
against
your
majesty
arangbar
smile
faded
as
he
turned
back
to
hawksworth
we
have
not
yet
decided
her
fate
inglish
she
does
not
concern
you
may
it
please
your
majesty
she
concerns
me
very
much
i
come
to
ask
your
majesty
permission
to
make
her
my
wife
and
to
take
her
back
to
england
with
me
if
your
majesty
will
release
her
she
will
be
gone
from
india
soon
and
will
trouble
your
majesty
no
further
but
we
just
told
you
you
are
not
returning
inglish
not
until
we
permit
it
he
grinned
you
must
stay
and
play
this
instrument
for
us
more
then
i
beg
that
her
life
be
spared
until
the
time
i
am
allowed
to
leave
arangbar
studied
hawksworth
and
a
grudging
smile
played
on
his
lips
you
are
an
excellent
judge
of
women
inglish
perhaps
too
much
so
i
suspected
it
the
first
time
i
saw
you
she
wishes
no
ill
toward
your
majesty
there
is
no
purpose
in
taking
her
life
how
do
you
know
what
she
wishes
for
us
inglish
i
think
we
know
better
than
you
arangbar
paused
to
sip
again
from
his
wine
cup
but
we
will
spare
her
for
now
if
your
king
will
agree
to
send
warships
to
drive
the
infidel
portuguese
from
our
shores
and
if
you
will
agree
to
play
more
for
me
will
your
majesty
order
her
release
i
will
move
her
to
my
for
now
inglish
until
matters
are
settled
i
will
order
her
brought
with
us
to
fatehpur
that
is
my
part
of
the
bargain
what
will
you
do
about
yours
i
will
inform
my
king
of
your
majesty
wishes
and
he
will
comply
if
he
wants
to
trade
in
india
arangbar
turned
to
nadir
sharif
order
a
horse
for
the
inglish
he
will
ride
with
us
today
and
have
the
woman
shirin
sent
to
the
nadir
sharif
bowed
and
edged
next
to
arangbar
adopting
a
confidential
tone
if
i
may
be
allowed
your
majesty
you
are
aware
the
woman
shirin
would
not
be
entirely
welcome
in
the
her
majesty
queen
janahara
her
majesty
is
not
the
moghul
of
india
arangbar
seemed
suddenly
exhilarated
by
the
absence
of
the
queen
i
have
ordered
it
to
hear
is
to
obey
nadir
sharif
bowed
low
casting
a
worried
glance
toward
hawksworth
but
perhaps
it
would
be
equally
pleasing
to
your
majesty
and
to
her
majesty
as
well
to
allow
the
woman
to
travel
to
fatehpur
under
the
cognizance
of
the
english
ambassador
arangbar
glanced
toward
the
palace
and
his
exhilaration
seemed
to
dissolve
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
until
fatehpur
then
after
that
we
will
decide
where
she
will
be
kept
until
the
inglish
satisfies
his
part
of
the
bargain
arangbar
turned
to
hawksworth
agreed
inglish
i
bow
to
your
majesty
will
is
concluded
arangbar
rose
by
himself
and
moved
to
the
edge
of
the
tent
pavilion
as
the
trumpets
and
drums
again
sounded
the
fanning
eunuchs
scurried
to
stay
beside
him
he
stepped
into
the
sunshine
stared
about
the
square
for
a
moment
then
turned
to
nadir
sharif
order
everyone
cleared
and
the
women
brought
i
am
suddenly
growing
weary
of
agra
nadir
sharif
bowed
again
and
spoke
quickly
to
the
captain
of
the
guard
as
the
order
was
circulated
he
quietly
moved
next
to
hawksworth
so
it
seems
your
luck
changed
after
all
ambassador
for
now
but
i
fear
it
may
not
last
as
a
friend
i
suggest
you
make
the
most
of
it
chapter
the
dark
sky
had
begun
to
show
pale
in
the
east
heralding
the
first
traces
of
day
hawksworth
stood
in
the
shadows
of
his
tent
at
the
edge
of
the
vast
imperial
camp
and
pulled
his
frayed
leather
jerkin
tighter
against
the
cold
he
watched
as
the
elephants
filed
past
bulky
silhouettes
against
the
dawn
they
were
being
led
from
the
temporary
stables
on
the
hill
behind
him
toward
the
valley
below
where
cauldrons
of
water
were
being
stoked
for
their
morning
bath
heating
the
water
for
the
elephant
baths
had
become
routine
during
the
reign
of
akman
who
had
noticed
his
elephants
shivering
from
their
baths
on
chilly
mornings
and
decreed
their
bath
water
warmed
henceforth
as
he
watched
the
line
of
giant
animals
winding
their
way
through
the
camp
waving
their
trunks
in
the
morning
air
he
realized
they
were
not
docile
female
but
male
war
elephants
first
and
second
rank
war
elephants
called
full
blood
were
selected
from
young
males
who
had
demonstrated
the
endurance
and
even
temper
essential
in
battle
those
granted
second
rank
called
were
slightly
smaller
but
with
the
same
temperament
and
strength
each
elephant
had
five
keepers
and
was
placed
under
the
training
of
a
special
military
superintendent
whose
responsibility
was
to
school
the
animal
in
boldness
amid
artillery
fire
the
keepers
were
monitored
monthly
by
imperial
inspectors
who
fined
them
a
month
wages
if
their
elephant
had
noticeably
lost
weight
should
an
elephant
lose
a
tusk
through
its
keepers
inattention
to
an
infection
they
were
fined
one
eighth
the
value
of
the
animal
and
if
an
elephant
died
in
their
care
they
received
a
penalty
of
three
months
wages
and
a
year
suspension
but
the
position
of
elephant
keeper
was
a
coveted
place
of
great
responsibility
a
war
elephant
could
be
valued
at
a
hundred
thousand
rupees
a
full
and
experienced
commanders
had
been
known
to
declare
one
good
elephant
worth
five
hundred
horses
in
a
battle
hawksworth
studied
the
elephants
admiring
their
disciplined
stride
and
easy
footing
and
wondered
again
why
the
army
had
stationed
its
stables
so
near
the
imperial
camp
did
arangbar
somehow
feel
he
needed
protection
they
magnificent
do
you
think
shirin
emerged
from
her
tent
to
join
him
absently
running
her
hand
across
the
back
of
his
jerkin
it
had
been
six
days
since
they
had
left
agra
and
it
seemed
to
hawksworth
she
had
grown
more
beautiful
each
day
more
loving
each
night
the
nightmare
of
the
past
weeks
had
already
faded
to
a
distant
memory
she
was
fully
dressed
now
with
a
transparent
scarf
pinned
to
her
dark
hair
by
a
band
of
pearls
thick
gold
bracelets
flowered
trousers
beneath
a
translucent
skirt
and
dark
her
eyes
and
eyebrows
he
watched
enthralled
as
she
pulled
a
light
cloak
over
her
shoulders
especially
in
the
morning
they
say
akman
used
to
train
his
royal
elephants
to
dance
to
music
and
to
shoot
a
bow
i
do
think
i
ever
get
used
to
elephants
hawksworth
admired
her
a
moment
longer
in
the
dawn
light
then
looked
back
at
the
immense
forms
lumbering
past
trying
to
push
aside
the
uneasy
feeling
their
presence
gave
him
you
be
very
amused
to
hear
what
people
in
london
think
they
like
nobody
there
has
ever
seen
an
elephant
but
there
are
lots
of
fables
about
them
it
said
elephants
wo
ford
a
clear
stream
during
the
day
because
they
afraid
of
their
reflection
so
they
only
cross
streams
at
night
shirin
laughed
out
loud
and
reached
to
kiss
him
quickly
on
the
cheek
i
never
know
whether
to
believe
your
stories
of
england
i
swear
it
and
the
coaches
you
told
me
about
describe
one
again
it
has
four
wheels
instead
of
two
like
your
carts
have
and
it
really
is
pulled
by
horses
usually
two
but
sometimes
four
it
enclosed
and
inside
there
are
seats
and
cushions
almost
like
a
palanquin
does
that
mean
your
king
all
ride
in
these
strange
coaches
instead
of
on
elephants
in
the
first
place
king
james
has
no
i
do
think
know
what
to
do
with
that
many
women
and
there
are
absolutely
no
elephants
in
england
not
even
one
can
you
possibly
understand
how
hard
it
is
for
me
to
imagine
a
place
without
elephants
and
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
and
no
camels
either
no
camels
but
we
have
lots
of
stories
about
camels
too
tell
me
is
it
true
that
if
you
poisoned
you
can
be
put
inside
a
newly
slain
camel
and
it
will
draw
out
the
poison
shirin
laughed
again
and
looked
up
the
hill
toward
the
stables
where
pack
camels
were
being
fed
and
massaged
with
sesame
oil
the
bells
on
their
chest
ropes
sounded
lightly
as
their
keepers
began
harnessing
them
in
strings
of
five
hawksworth
turned
to
watch
as
the
men
began
fitting
two
of
the
camels
to
carry
a
a
wooden
turret
suspended
between
them
by
heavy
wooden
poles
all
the
camels
were
groaning
pitifully
and
biting
at
their
keepers
their
customary
response
to
the
prospect
of
work
that
sounds
like
some
tale
you
hear
in
the
bazaar
why
should
a
dead
camel
draw
out
poison
she
turned
back
to
hawksworth
sometimes
you
make
the
english
sound
awfully
naive
tell
me
what
it
really
like
there
it
is
truly
beautiful
the
fairest
land
there
is
especially
in
the
late
spring
and
early
summer
when
it
green
and
cool
hawksworth
watched
the
sun
emerge
from
behind
a
distant
hill
beginning
to
blaze
savagely
against
the
parched
winter
landscape
almost
the
moment
it
appeared
thoughts
of
england
suddenly
made
him
long
for
shade
and
he
took
shirin
arm
leading
her
around
the
side
of
their
rise
and
back
into
the
morning
cool
ahead
of
them
lay
yet
another
bleak
valley
rocky
and
sere
i
sometimes
wonder
how
you
can
survive
here
in
summer
it
was
already
autumn
when
i
made
landfall
and
the
heat
was
still
unbearable
late
spring
is
even
worse
than
summer
at
least
in
summer
rain
but
we
accustomed
to
the
heat
we
say
no
gets
used
to
it
i
do
think
anyone
from
your
england
could
ever
really
love
or
understand
india
do
give
up
hope
yet
i
starting
to
like
it
he
took
her
chin
in
his
hand
and
carefully
studied
her
face
with
a
scrutinizing
frown
his
eyes
playing
critically
from
her
eyes
to
her
mouth
to
her
vaguely
aquiline
persian
nose
what
part
do
i
like
best
he
laughed
and
kissed
the
tip
of
her
nose
i
think
it
the
diamond
you
wear
in
your
left
nostril
all
women
wear
those
she
bit
at
him
so
i
have
to
also
but
never
liked
it
you
better
think
of
something
else
he
slipped
his
arm
around
her
and
held
her
next
to
him
wondering
if
he
should
tell
her
of
his
bargain
with
arangbar
that
she
had
been
released
only
because
he
had
offered
to
take
her
from
india
forever
for
a
moment
the
temptation
was
powerful
but
he
resisted
not
yet
give
her
a
chance
to
turn
headstrong
and
refuse
you
know
i
think
you
like
england
once
you
saw
it
even
with
no
elephants
and
no
slaves
to
fan
away
the
flies
we
not
as
primitive
as
you
seem
to
imagine
we
have
music
and
if
you
learn
our
language
you
might
discover
england
has
many
fine
poets
like
the
one
you
once
recited
for
me
she
turned
to
face
him
what
was
his
name
that
was
john
donne
i
hear
he
a
cleric
now
so
i
doubt
he
writing
his
randy
poems
and
songs
any
more
but
there
are
others
like
sir
walter
raleigh
a
staunch
adventurer
who
writes
passable
verse
and
there
also
ben
jonson
who
writes
poems
and
plays
also
in
fact
lots
of
english
plays
are
in
verse
what
do
you
mean
by
plays
english
plays
they
like
nothing
else
in
the
world
he
stared
wistfully
into
the
parched
valley
spread
out
before
them
sometimes
i
think
they
what
i
miss
most
about
london
when
i
away
well
what
are
they
they
stories
that
are
acted
out
by
players
in
playhouses
she
laughed
then
perhaps
you
should
begin
by
explaining
a
playhouse
the
best
one
is
the
globe
which
is
just
across
the
thames
from
london
in
the
bankside
edge
of
southwark
near
the
bridge
it
was
built
by
some
merchants
and
by
an
actor
from
who
also
writes
their
plays
it
three
stories
high
and
circular
with
high
balconies
and
there
a
covered
stage
at
one
side
where
the
players
perform
do
the
women
in
these
plays
dance
like
our
actually
the
players
are
all
men
sometimes
they
take
the
roles
of
women
but
i
never
seen
them
dance
all
that
much
there
are
plays
about
famous
english
kings
and
sometimes
there
are
stories
of
thwarted
love
usually
set
in
italy
plays
are
a
new
thing
in
england
and
there
nothing
like
them
anywhere
else
shirin
settled
against
a
boulder
and
watched
the
shadows
cast
by
the
rising
sun
stretch
out
across
the
valley
she
sat
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
and
then
she
laughed
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
india
had
dramas
about
kings
and
thwarted
love
over
a
thousand
years
ago
they
were
in
sanskrit
and
they
were
written
by
men
named
bhavabhuti
and
bhasa
and
kalidasa
whose
lives
are
legends
now
a
pandit
the
title
hindus
give
their
scholars
once
told
me
about
a
play
called
the
clay
cart
it
was
about
a
poor
king
who
fell
in
love
with
a
rich
courtesan
but
there
are
no
plays
here
now
unless
you
count
the
dance
dramas
they
have
in
the
south
sanskrit
is
a
dead
language
and
muslims
do
really
care
for
plays
i
wager
you
like
the
plays
in
london
they
exciting
and
sometimes
the
poetry
can
be
very
moving
what
it
like
to
go
to
see
one
first
on
the
day
a
play
is
performed
they
fly
a
big
white
banner
of
silk
from
a
staff
atop
the
globe
and
you
can
see
it
all
over
london
the
admission
is
only
a
penny
for
old
plays
and
two
pence
for
new
ones
that
all
you
ever
have
to
pay
if
you
willing
to
stand
in
the
pit
if
you
want
to
pay
a
little
more
you
can
get
a
seat
in
the
galleries
around
the
side
up
out
of
the
dust
and
chips
and
for
a
little
extra
you
can
get
a
cushion
for
the
seat
or
for
sixpence
you
can
enter
directly
through
the
stage
door
and
sit
in
a
stall
at
the
side
of
the
stage
just
before
the
play
begins
there
a
trumpet
fanfare
like
arangbar
has
when
he
enters
the
and
the
doorkeepers
pass
through
the
galleries
to
collect
the
money
what
do
they
do
with
it
they
put
it
into
a
locked
box
hawksworth
grinned
which
wags
have
taken
to
calling
the
box
office
because
they
so
officious
about
it
but
the
money
perfectly
safe
plays
are
in
the
afternoon
while
there
daylight
but
are
they
performed
inside
this
building
shirin
seemed
to
be
only
half
listening
the
globe
has
an
open
roof
except
over
the
stage
but
if
it
gets
too
dull
on
winter
afternoons
they
light
the
stage
with
torches
of
burning
pitch
or
tar
who
exactly
goes
to
these
playhouses
everyone
except
maybe
the
puritans
anybody
can
afford
a
penny
and
the
globe
is
not
that
far
from
the
southwark
bear
gardens
so
a
lot
of
people
come
after
they
been
to
see
bearbaiting
the
pit
is
usually
full
of
rowdy
tradesmen
who
stand
around
the
stage
and
turn
the
air
blue
with
tobacco
smoke
so
women
and
women
from
good
families
would
go
of
course
women
go
hawksworth
tried
unsuccessfully
to
suppress
a
smile
there
are
gallants
in
london
who
tell
you
the
globe
is
the
perfect
place
to
spot
a
comely
wench
or
even
a
woman
of
fashion
looking
for
some
sport
while
her
husband
drunk
at
a
gaming
house
i
do
believe
such
things
happen
well
that
the
way
it
is
in
england
hawksworth
settled
against
the
boulder
you
have
to
understand
women
there
do
let
themselves
be
locked
up
and
hidden
behind
veils
so
if
a
cavalier
spies
a
comely
woman
at
the
globe
he
find
a
way
to
praise
her
dress
or
her
figure
and
then
he
offer
to
sit
next
to
her
you
know
just
to
make
sure
some
rude
fellow
does
trod
on
the
hem
of
her
petticoats
with
muddy
boots
and
no
chips
fall
in
her
lap
then
after
the
play
begins
he
buy
her
a
bag
of
roasted
chestnuts
or
maybe
some
oranges
from
one
of
the
walking
through
the
galleries
and
if
she
carries
on
with
him
a
bit
he
offer
to
squire
her
home
i
suppose
you
done
just
that
she
examined
him
in
dismay
hawksworth
shifted
avoiding
her
gaze
i
mainly
heard
of
it
well
i
do
enjoy
hearing
about
it
what
about
the
honor
of
these
women
families
they
sound
reprehensible
with
less
dignity
than
oh
no
they
very
different
he
turned
with
a
wink
and
tweaked
her
ear
they
do
dance
that
even
worse
at
least
most
have
some
training
you
already
think
english
women
are
wicked
and
you
never
even
met
one
that
not
fair
but
i
think
you
come
to
love
england
if
we
were
in
london
now
right
this
minute
we
could
hire
one
of
those
coaches
you
do
believe
exist
a
coach
with
two
horses
and
a
coachman
cost
scarcely
more
than
ten
shillings
a
day
if
prices
gone
up
and
ride
out
to
a
country
inn
just
outside
london
the
country
is
as
green
as
nadir
sharif
palace
garden
with
fields
and
hedgerows
that
look
like
a
great
patchwork
coverlet
sewed
by
some
sotted
alewife
hawksworth
chest
tightened
with
homesickness
if
you
want
to
look
like
an
englishwoman
you
could
powder
your
breasts
with
white
lead
and
rouge
your
nipples
and
maybe
paste
some
beauty
stars
on
your
cheeks
i
dine
you
on
goose
and
veal
and
capon
and
nappy
english
ale
and
english
mutton
dripping
with
more
fat
than
any
lamb
you
taste
in
agra
shirin
studied
him
silently
for
a
moment
you
love
to
talk
of
england
do
you
but
i
rather
you
talked
about
india
i
want
you
to
stay
why
would
you
ever
want
to
leave
i
trying
to
tell
you
you
love
england
if
you
gave
yourself
a
chance
i
have
the
and
when
i
return
the
east
india
company
will
arangbar
will
never
sign
a
the
english
king
to
trade
do
you
realize
queen
janahara
will
never
allow
it
right
now
i
less
worried
about
the
queen
than
about
jadar
i
think
he
wants
to
stop
the
why
i
do
know
but
he
succeeded
so
far
he
almost
stopped
it
permanently
with
his
false
rumor
about
the
fleet
he
did
it
deliberately
to
raise
arangbar
hopes
and
then
disappoint
him
with
the
blame
falling
on
me
who
knows
what
think
to
do
next
you
so
wrong
about
him
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
do
you
understand
why
he
had
to
do
that
you
never
once
asked
me
hawksworth
stared
at
her
tell
me
why
to
divert
the
portuguese
fleet
it
so
obvious
he
somehow
discovered
queen
janahara
had
paid
the
portuguese
viceroy
to
ship
cannons
to
malik
ambar
if
the
marathas
had
gotten
cannon
they
could
have
defended
ahmadnagar
forever
so
he
tricked
the
portuguese
into
searching
for
the
english
fleet
that
was
there
the
portuguese
are
a
lot
more
worried
about
their
trade
monopoly
than
about
what
happens
to
prince
jadar
he
knew
they
would
be
i
know
you
support
him
but
for
my
money
he
still
a
certified
bastard
hawksworth
studied
her
for
a
moment
wondering
whether
to
believe
her
words
if
it
were
actually
true
it
would
all
make
sense
would
fill
out
a
bizarre
tapestry
of
palace
deception
but
in
the
end
his
ruse
had
done
jadar
no
good
and
for
all
his
scheming
he
was
still
defeated
in
the
south
i
hear
the
rumors
too
hawksworth
rose
and
took
shirin
arm
she
started
to
reply
then
stopped
herself
they
began
to
walk
slowly
back
toward
his
tent
so
he
deceived
everyone
to
no
purpose
as
they
rounded
the
curve
of
the
slope
and
emerged
into
the
sunshine
hawksworth
noted
that
some
of
the
war
elephants
had
already
been
led
back
to
their
stables
and
were
being
harnessed
he
looked
across
the
valley
toward
the
tents
of
the
imperial
army
and
thought
he
sensed
a
growing
urgency
in
the
air
as
though
men
and
horse
were
being
quietly
mobilized
to
move
out
but
do
you
realize
the
prince
is
not
retreating
shirin
finally
seized
his
arm
and
stopped
him
no
one
here
yet
realizes
that
malik
ambar
has
her
voice
trailed
off
as
she
looked
ahead
a
group
of
rajput
officers
was
loitering
aimlessly
near
the
entrance
to
her
tent
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
now
what
happening
her
voice
grew
quieter
just
be
ready
to
ride
hawksworth
stared
at
her
uncomprehending
ride
where
he
reached
to
touch
her
hand
but
she
glanced
at
the
rajputs
and
quickly
pulled
it
away
i
do
want
to
ride
anywhere
i
want
to
tell
you
more
about
england
do
you
think
you
like
to
see
it
someday
i
do
know
perhaps
she
shifted
her
gaze
away
from
the
rajputs
for
an
instant
hawksworth
thought
he
saw
her
make
a
quick
movement
with
her
hands
urging
them
to
leave
or
had
she
they
casually
moved
on
down
the
hill
their
shields
swinging
loosely
from
their
shoulder
straps
after
after
things
are
settled
after
what
after
arangbar
signs
the
i
ca
seem
to
make
you
understand
she
turned
to
face
him
squarely
about
prince
jadar
even
if
you
got
a
would
soon
be
worthless
i
understand
this
much
if
he
thinking
to
challenge
arangbar
and
the
queen
then
he
god
own
fool
have
you
seen
the
army
traveling
with
us
it
three
times
the
size
of
jadar
he
turned
and
continued
to
walk
his
imperial
majesty
may
be
a
sot
but
he
in
no
peril
from
young
prince
jadar
as
they
approached
the
entrance
to
his
tent
she
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
at
him
her
eyes
a
mixture
of
longing
and
apprehension
i
ca
stay
now
not
today
she
kissed
him
quickly
and
before
he
could
speak
she
was
moving
rapidly
down
the
hill
in
the
direction
the
rajputs
had
gone
queen
janahara
studied
allaudin
thoughtfully
as
he
strode
toward
her
tent
his
floral
turban
was
set
rakishly
to
one
side
in
the
latest
style
and
his
purple
gauze
cloak
was
too
effeminate
for
anyone
but
a
eunuch
or
a
dandy
she
caught
a
flash
from
the
katar
at
his
waist
too
ornamental
ever
to
be
used
and
suddenly
realized
that
she
had
never
seen
him
actually
hold
a
knife
or
a
sword
she
had
never
seen
him
respond
to
any
crisis
and
princess
layla
had
hinted
he
was
not
quite
the
husband
she
had
envisioned
whatever
that
might
imply
suddenly
it
all
mattered
it
had
only
been
a
week
since
jadar
demands
had
been
refused
and
already
he
had
taken
the
initiative
now
she
sighed
she
would
have
to
protect
her
her
nothing
he
could
never
protect
himself
not
from
jadar
your
majesty
allaudin
salaamed
formally
as
he
dipped
below
the
tapestried
portiere
of
her
tent
never
forgetting
that
his
new
was
also
the
queen
the
princess
sends
her
wishes
for
your
health
this
morning
sit
down
janahara
continued
to
examine
him
with
her
brooding
dark
eyes
where
is
nadir
sharif
the
eunuchs
said
he
would
be
a
few
moments
late
he
always
tries
to
irritate
me
her
voice
trailed
off
as
she
watched
allaudin
ensconce
himself
with
a
wide
flourish
against
a
velvet
bolster
tell
me
are
you
content
with
your
bride
she
is
very
pleasing
to
me
majesty
are
you
satisfying
your
obligations
as
a
husband
majesty
allaudin
looked
up
at
her
as
though
not
comprehending
the
question
your
duties
are
not
merely
to
her
or
to
me
they
also
to
india
jadar
has
a
male
heir
now
such
things
matter
in
agra
or
were
you
aware
allaudin
giggled
i
visit
her
tent
every
night
majesty
but
for
what
purpose
after
you
drunk
and
you
spent
yourself
with
a
do
deny
it
i
know
it
true
do
you
forget
she
has
servants
there
are
no
secrets
in
this
camp
i
think
sooner
sire
an
heir
on
a
slave
girl
than
on
my
daughter
i
will
not
have
it
majesty
allaudin
twisted
uncomfortably
and
glanced
up
with
relief
to
see
nadir
sharif
pushing
aside
the
portiere
of
the
tent
as
he
entered
janahara
motioned
toward
the
servants
and
eunuchs
waiting
in
attendance
and
in
moments
they
had
disappeared
through
the
curtained
doorways
at
the
rear
you
late
my
sincerest
apologies
majesty
there
are
endless
matters
to
attend
you
know
his
majesty
still
holds
morning
his
tent
and
has
two
a
day
the
difficulties
your
are
only
beginning
she
was
extracting
a
dispatch
from
a
gilded
bamboo
tube
read
this
nadir
sharif
took
the
document
and
moved
into
the
light
at
the
entrance
he
had
always
despised
the
red
chintz
tents
of
the
imperial
family
whose
doorways
were
forever
sealed
with
persian
hangings
that
kept
in
all
the
smoke
and
lamp
soot
as
he
studied
the
dispatch
he
moved
even
closer
to
the
light
astonishment
growing
in
his
eyes
he
read
it
through
twice
before
turning
back
to
janahara
has
his
majesty
seen
this
yet
of
course
not
but
he
will
have
to
eventually
who
is
it
from
allaudin
stared
up
from
the
bolster
his
voice
uneasy
your
brother
janahara
studied
him
with
eyes
verging
on
contempt
jadar
has
declared
he
is
no
longer
under
the
authority
of
the
moghul
she
paused
to
make
sure
the
news
had
reached
allaudin
do
you
understand
what
that
means
jadar
has
rebelled
he
probably
marching
on
agra
right
now
with
his
army
that
impossible
as
long
as
his
majesty
lives
jadar
has
declared
his
majesty
is
no
longer
fit
to
reign
he
has
offered
to
assume
the
himself
it
a
preposterous
affront
to
legitimate
rule
then
he
must
be
brought
to
agra
for
trial
allaudin
voice
swelled
with
determination
obviously
nadir
sharif
moved
toward
the
door
of
the
tent
and
stared
into
the
sunshine
for
a
long
moment
then
he
turned
to
janahara
we
have
no
choice
now
but
to
send
the
imperial
army
your
intuition
about
jadar
last
week
was
all
too
correct
and
now
you
agree
after
a
week
has
been
lost
janahara
had
followed
him
with
her
eyes
now
you
concede
that
the
army
must
move
there
nothing
else
to
be
done
nadir
sharif
seemed
to
study
the
parched
landscape
of
the
valley
below
although
containing
jadar
may
well
be
more
difficult
than
we
first
assumed
why
should
it
be
difficult
allaudin
watched
nadir
sharif
in
bewilderment
his
forces
were
very
small
to
begin
with
and
after
his
defeat
by
malik
ambar
how
many
men
and
cavalry
can
he
have
left
perhaps
you
should
read
the
dispatch
nadir
sharif
tossed
the
scrolled
paper
into
allaudin
lap
jadar
never
engaged
malik
ambar
instead
he
forged
an
alliance
it
would
appear
his
north
to
burhanpur
was
merely
a
ruse
he
never
met
the
maratha
armies
in
the
first
place
so
he
did
not
lose
a
single
infantryman
instead
he
intimidated
malik
ambar
and
struck
a
truce
with
him
there
no
knowing
how
large
his
army
is
now
or
even
where
he
is
this
dispatch
came
from
mandu
so
he
already
well
on
his
way
north
i
think
he
probably
lay
siege
to
agra
within
two
weeks
if
he
not
stopped
merciful
allah
allaudin
voice
was
suddenly
tremulous
what
do
we
do
then
he
looked
imploringly
at
janahara
i
lead
the
army
myself
if
you
want
janahara
seemed
not
to
hear
him
as
she
rose
and
walked
toward
the
door
of
the
tent
nadir
sharif
stepped
aside
as
she
shoved
back
the
tapestry
and
stared
out
into
the
valley
this
morning
i
ordered
inayat
latif
to
mobilize
and
march
without
telling
his
majesty
nadir
sharif
stared
at
her
incredulously
i
ordered
it
in
his
name
i
suspected
something
like
this
might
happen
so
i
had
him
sign
and
stamp
the
order
four
days
ago
was
his
majesty
entirely
sob
nadir
sharif
hesitated
was
he
in
full
understanding
of
what
he
was
authorizing
that
hardly
matters
now
but
you
must
place
the
seal
you
keep
on
the
order
also
before
it
forwarded
to
the
be
officially
recorded
she
did
not
shift
her
gaze
from
the
sunlit
valley
it
on
the
table
behind
you
nadir
sharif
turned
and
stared
down
at
the
stand
the
order
was
there
a
single
folded
piece
of
paper
inside
a
gilded
leather
cover
the
string
which
would
secure
it
had
not
yet
been
tied
you
were
wise
to
have
taken
this
precaution
majesty
nadir
sharif
glanced
back
at
janahara
his
voice
flowing
with
admiration
no
predicting
his
majesty
mind
these
days
only
yesterday
i
discovered
he
had
completely
forgotten
have
you
stamped
it
my
seal
is
not
here
majesty
he
paused
and
i
was
wondering
would
it
be
wise
to
review
our
strategy
briefly
with
his
majesty
lest
he
become
confused
later
and
forget
he
authorized
the
order
perhaps
even
countermand
it
your
seal
will
be
sufficient
it
in
the
pocket
of
your
cloak
where
you
always
carry
it
the
pocket
on
the
left
your
majesty
memory
is
astonishing
sometimes
nadir
sharif
quickly
extracted
the
metal
case
flipped
off
the
cover
and
with
a
flourish
imprinted
the
black
seal
of
the
realm
on
the
top
of
the
order
beneath
arangbar
signature
and
the
impression
of
his
royal
signet
ring
when
will
the
army
be
able
to
move
tomorrow
most
of
the
elephants
are
moving
out
this
morning
janahara
turned
back
and
glanced
at
the
paper
with
satisfaction
and
tomorrow
we
will
all
return
to
agra
the
plague
is
subsiding
and
i
think
his
majesty
should
be
in
the
fort
i
agree
entirely
has
it
been
ordered
i
will
order
it
later
today
jadar
can
not
move
his
army
that
rapidly
i
will
begin
preparations
to
go
with
the
army
allaudin
rose
and
adjusted
the
jeweled
katar
at
his
belt
you
will
be
returning
to
the
red
fort
with
his
majesty
and
with
me
janahara
did
not
look
at
him
as
she
spoke
but
want
to
face
jadar
i
insist
he
tightened
his
gauze
cloak
i
will
demand
an
audience
with
his
majesty
if
you
refuse
janahara
studied
him
silently
for
a
moment
i
have
an
even
better
idea
since
jadar
has
refused
to
lead
the
army
to
defend
the
fortress
at
qandahar
how
would
you
like
to
be
appointed
in
his
place
allaudin
eyes
brightened
what
rank
would
i
have
i
think
we
can
persuade
his
majesty
to
raise
your
personal
rank
to
twelve
thousand
your
horse
rank
to
eight
thousand
twice
what
you
have
now
then
i
will
go
allaudin
tightened
his
cloak
beaming
i
drive
the
safavid
king
persian
troops
back
into
the
desert
you
are
as
sensible
as
you
are
brave
i
will
speak
to
his
majesty
tonight
allaudin
grinned
a
parting
salaam
squared
his
shoulders
and
pushed
his
way
through
the
portiere
and
into
the
sunshine
nadir
sharif
watched
without
a
word
until
he
had
disappeared
into
his
own
tent
was
that
entirely
wise
majesty
what
else
do
you
propose
we
do
it
will
keep
him
in
agra
i
see
to
that
you
do
really
think
i
allow
him
to
leave
anyway
it
time
his
rank
was
elevated
now
all
he
needs
is
a
son
i
sure
he
have
one
in
time
majesty
the
hindu
astrologers
all
say
princess
layla
horoscope
is
favorable
the
hindu
astrologers
may
have
to
help
him
do
a
husband
work
if
they
want
to
save
their
reputation
give
him
time
majesty
nadir
sharif
smiled
and
he
have
more
heirs
than
the
holy
prophet
all
the
prophet
children
were
daughters
she
took
the
paper
inserted
it
into
the
gold
case
and
began
tying
the
string
there
are
times
you
do
not
entirely
amuse
me
i
always
half
distracted
by
worrying
nadir
sharif
followed
her
with
his
eyes
even
now
what
in
particular
worries
you
at
the
moment
janahara
paused
as
she
was
slipping
the
case
into
her
sleeve
i
thinking
just
now
about
the
imperial
army
the
loyalty
of
some
of
the
men
what
do
you
mean
inayat
latif
is
entirely
beholden
to
his
majesty
he
would
gladly
give
his
life
for
the
moghul
i
heard
it
from
his
own
lips
and
i
know
it
true
i
never
questioned
your
commander
loyalty
but
now
you
his
majesty
will
be
ordering
the
men
to
march
against
jadar
are
you
aware
that
fully
a
third
of
the
army
is
under
rajput
field
commanders
officers
from
the
northwest
some
of
the
rajas
there
still
bear
ill
feelings
toward
his
majesty
because
of
inayat
latifs
campaign
there
ten
years
ago
these
rajputs
sometimes
have
long
memories
and
who
knows
what
jadar
could
be
promising
them
remember
his
treachery
with
malik
ambar
what
are
you
suggesting
that
the
rajput
commanders
will
not
fight
for
his
majesty
the
legitimate
moghul
that
absurd
no
one
respects
authority
more
than
the
rajput
rajas
i
not
suggesting
it
at
all
but
i
do
believe
the
rajputs
here
should
be
monitored
closely
nonetheless
any
discontent
should
be
addressed
before
it
grows
unwieldy
perhaps
their
commanders
should
be
placed
under
a
separate
authority
someone
who
could
reason
with
them
in
his
majesty
name
if
there
are
signs
of
unrest
inayat
latif
is
an
able
general
but
he
no
diplomat
janahara
studied
him
closely
do
you
believe
there
would
be
unrest
your
majesty
is
perhaps
not
always
fully
informed
as
to
the
activities
of
some
of
the
more
militant
rajput
loyalists
i
have
ordered
them
watched
at
all
times
what
are
you
suggesting
then
that
the
rajputs
should
be
placed
under
a
separate
top
command
some
raja
whose
loyalty
is
unquestionable
i
suggesting
precisely
that
if
there
were
extensive
defections
it
would
be
demoralizing
for
the
rest
of
the
army
at
the
very
least
who
do
you
propose
there
are
any
number
of
rajput
commanders
i
would
trust
to
a
point
but
it
always
difficult
to
know
where
their
final
loyalties
lie
nadir
sharif
paused
lost
in
thought
perhaps
an
alternate
solution
might
be
to
allow
someone
of
unquestioned
loyalty
to
monitor
the
rajput
field
commanders
someone
experienced
in
handling
rajput
concerns
though
not
necessarily
a
general
then
the
command
could
remain
unified
with
orders
passing
through
this
other
individual
who
would
ensure
compliance
again
is
there
someone
you
would
recommend
there
are
several
men
near
his
majesty
who
could
serve
it
is
of
course
essential
their
loyalty
to
you
be
beyond
question
in
a
way
it
a
pity
prince
allaudin
is
not
older
blood
is
always
best
that
leaves
only
you
or
father
who
is
far
too
old
my
responsibilities
here
would
really
make
it
impossible
for
me
nadir
sharif
turned
and
walked
again
to
the
door
of
the
tent
pulling
back
the
portiere
certainly
i
could
not
leave
his
majesty
for
an
extended
campaign
but
if
the
campaign
were
short
perhaps
for
a
few
weeks
janahara
studied
him
silently
her
thoughts
churning
at
times
even
nadir
sharif
loyalty
seemed
problematical
but
now
there
was
a
perfect
way
to
test
it
in
advance
i
will
advise
inayat
latif
you
are
now
in
charge
of
the
rajput
commanders
your
majesty
nadir
sharif
bowed
lightly
i
honored
by
your
confidence
i
sure
it
well
placed
she
did
not
smile
but
before
i
make
the
arrangements
there
one
other
assignment
for
you
totally
confidential
anything
within
my
power
nadir
sharif
bowed
elegantly
tonight
i
want
you
to
order
the
imperial
guards
stationed
in
your
compound
to
execute
the
englishman
and
the
woman
shirin
on
your
sole
authority
of
course
nadir
sharifs
smile
did
not
flicker
hawksworth
finally
returned
to
his
compound
near
midnight
carrying
his
empty
flask
of
brandy
he
had
wandered
the
length
of
the
chaotic
tent
city
searching
for
shirin
over
the
past
five
hours
he
had
combed
the
wide
streets
of
the
bazaar
searched
through
the
elephant
stables
and
circled
the
high
chintz
border
of
the
imperial
enclosure
the
periphery
of
the
camp
swarmed
with
infantrymen
and
their
wives
gathering
supplies
for
the
march
and
already
there
had
been
numerous
fights
in
the
bazaar
where
prices
had
soared
after
the
announcement
the
army
would
march
as
he
neared
his
tent
he
looked
up
at
the
stars
brilliant
even
through
the
lingering
evening
smoke
from
the
cooking
fires
and
mused
about
jadar
the
rebel
prince
would
soon
be
facing
inayat
latif
just
recalled
to
agra
two
months
earlier
after
a
brutally
successful
campaign
in
bengal
extending
the
imperial
frontier
against
local
hindu
chieftains
inayat
latif
was
a
veteran
commander
who
revered
the
moghul
and
would
do
anything
in
his
power
to
protect
him
although
he
had
made
no
secret
of
his
dislike
of
the
persian
junta
he
shared
their
common
alarm
at
the
threat
of
rebellion
it
was
arangbar
he
would
be
fighting
to
defend
not
the
queen
the
imperial
army
is
invincible
now
hawksworth
told
himself
its
cavalry
outnumbers
jadar
easily
three
to
one
and
its
officers
are
at
full
strength
there
are
at
least
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
ready
to
march
how
many
can
jadar
have
fifty
thousand
perhaps
less
jadar
can
never
meet
them
the
most
he
can
possibly
do
is
skirmish
and
retreat
perhaps
he
thought
ruefully
it
was
all
just
as
well
a
decisive
defeat
for
jadar
would
the
paralysis
at
court
and
the
indecision
in
shirin
mind
she
would
realize
finally
that
jadar
had
attempted
to
move
too
fast
the
mission
might
still
be
saved
with
the
portuguese
resistance
neutralized
there
were
even
rumors
that
arangbar
had
ordered
father
sarmento
back
to
goa
there
would
be
no
voices
in
agra
to
poison
arangbar
mind
daily
against
the
king
james
after
all
he
asked
himself
who
else
could
arangbar
turn
to
england
alone
has
the
naval
strength
to
challenge
portugal
even
if
it
might
require
years
to
break
their
monopoly
completely
he
would
bargain
for
a
exchange
for
a
vague
promise
of
king
james
help
against
the
portuguese
it
was
a
bargain
england
surely
could
keep
eventually
he
slipped
through
the
doorway
of
his
tent
and
groped
for
the
lamp
an
open
bronze
dish
of
oil
with
a
wick
protruding
through
the
spout
it
rested
where
he
had
left
it
on
a
stand
near
his
sea
chest
and
he
sparked
a
flint
against
the
wick
suddenly
the
striped
cotton
walls
of
the
tent
glowed
around
him
he
removed
the
sword
at
his
belt
and
slipped
it
onto
the
carpet
then
he
removed
his
leather
jerkin
and
dropped
against
a
bolster
still
puzzling
about
shirin
her
status
during
the
past
few
days
had
been
ambiguous
as
a
divorced
muslim
woman
she
was
free
to
move
about
as
she
chose
but
everyone
knew
she
was
on
very
uncertain
terms
with
the
moghul
after
they
had
arrived
outside
the
western
wall
of
the
old
city
of
fatehpur
arangbar
had
been
too
preoccupied
to
remember
his
threat
to
move
her
into
the
she
had
remained
free
able
to
move
inconspicuously
about
the
camp
mingling
with
the
other
muslim
women
and
each
night
after
the
final
watch
was
announced
hawksworth
had
been
able
to
slip
unnoticed
to
her
tent
once
late
one
night
he
had
suggested
they
try
to
return
to
the
old
palace
of
akman
inside
the
walls
of
fatehpur
but
they
both
finally
decided
the
risk
would
be
too
great
he
had
hoped
the
days
and
nights
at
the
camp
would
bring
them
closer
together
and
in
a
way
they
had
although
shirin
still
seemed
to
retreat
at
times
into
a
special
realm
of
mourning
she
had
devised
for
herself
she
could
never
stop
remembering
samad
and
his
brutal
death
something
he
told
himself
had
to
change
he
had
begun
to
wonder
if
he
should
gamble
and
tell
her
of
the
terms
the
moghul
had
demanded
for
her
release
would
she
then
understand
she
had
no
choice
but
to
return
to
england
with
him
he
rose
and
rummaged
through
his
sea
chest
finding
another
bottle
of
brandy
almost
his
last
and
to
fight
his
despondency
he
poured
himself
a
cup
the
liquor
burned
its
way
down
like
a
warm
soothing
salve
and
he
turned
to
begin
assembling
his
few
belongings
for
packing
in
the
morning
he
had
reprimed
and
loaded
his
remaining
pistol
and
now
he
laid
it
on
the
table
beside
his
chest
then
he
drew
his
sword
from
its
scabbard
to
check
its
edge
and
the
polish
on
the
metal
holding
it
to
the
lamp
he
spotted
a
few
random
flecks
of
rust
and
he
found
a
cloth
and
burnished
them
away
his
few
clothes
were
already
piled
haphazardly
in
the
chest
now
virtually
empty
save
for
his
lute
he
found
his
leather
purse
at
the
bottom
and
counted
his
remaining
money
five
hundred
rupees
he
counted
them
twice
beginning
to
wonder
if
he
might
eventually
have
to
walk
all
the
way
back
to
surat
he
searched
the
floor
for
any
stray
items
and
came
across
vasant
katar
caught
between
the
folds
of
the
carpet
it
seemed
years
now
since
the
rajput
aide
of
jadar
had
slipped
it
into
his
hand
in
the
square
of
the
and
he
had
almost
forgotten
he
had
it
with
a
smile
of
recollection
he
gingerly
slipped
it
from
its
brocade
sheath
and
held
it
in
his
hand
puzzling
how
such
a
curiously
constructed
weapon
could
be
so
lethal
the
grip
was
diagonal
to
the
blade
so
that
it
could
only
be
used
to
thrust
like
a
pike
head
growing
out
of
your
fist
rajputs
were
said
to
kill
tigers
with
only
a
katar
and
a
leather
shield
but
he
was
sure
he
believed
the
stories
he
grasped
it
and
made
a
few
trial
thrusts
its
inch
blade
shining
in
the
lamplight
like
a
mirror
then
tossed
it
atop
his
sea
chest
it
would
make
a
nice
memento
of
the
trip
every
fighting
man
in
india
seemed
to
carry
one
who
in
london
would
ever
believe
such
a
weapon
unless
they
saw
it
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
caught
a
flutter
in
the
portiere
of
his
tent
and
he
looked
up
to
see
shirin
standing
silently
in
the
doorway
what
he
looked
up
to
greet
her
unsure
whether
to
betray
his
relief
by
taking
her
immediately
in
his
arms
or
to
scold
and
tease
her
a
bit
first
she
silenced
him
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
are
you
ready
her
voice
was
barely
above
a
whisper
ready
for
what
where
in
christ
name
have
you
been
i
been
again
she
silenced
him
as
she
moved
inside
are
you
ready
to
ride
she
glanced
in
dismay
at
the
belongings
he
had
scattered
about
the
tent
we
have
to
leave
now
before
dawn
have
you
gone
mad
he
stared
at
her
we
returning
to
agra
day
after
tomorrow
the
moghul
has
we
have
to
leave
now
tonight
she
examined
him
in
the
lamplight
consternation
growing
in
her
eyes
the
prince
jadar
is
finished
he
cut
her
off
do
be
a
sentimental
fool
he
brought
this
on
himself
you
ca
help
him
nobody
can
now
they
stood
eyes
locked
together
for
a
moment
that
seemed
as
long
as
eternity
hawksworth
did
not
move
from
his
place
on
the
carpet
gradually
her
eyes
clouded
with
sorrow
and
he
thought
he
saw
her
begin
to
turn
he
was
on
his
feet
seizing
her
arm
pulling
her
toward
him
i
not
letting
you
die
for
jadar
if
he
meant
to
win
he
do
it
without
either
of
he
sensed
a
movement
in
the
portiere
behind
her
and
looked
up
to
see
the
glint
of
a
sword
thrust
exactly
where
she
had
been
standing
she
caught
his
bewildered
look
and
revolved
in
time
to
see
the
sword
slash
through
the
fringed
cloth
an
imperial
guard
wearing
light
chain
mail
and
a
red
turban
moved
through
the
doorway
weapon
in
hand
you
son
of
a
whore
hawksworth
reached
back
for
the
naked
sword
lying
on
the
carpet
behind
him
and
grabbed
his
leather
jerkin
holding
the
leather
as
a
shield
he
lunged
at
the
attacker
as
hawksworth
sword
thrust
reached
him
the
guard
caught
the
blade
with
his
own
and
instinctively
parried
it
aside
throwing
hawksworth
against
a
tent
pole
as
he
tried
to
regain
his
footing
he
heard
shirin
cry
out
and
turned
to
see
a
heavy
sword
cut
through
the
side
of
the
tent
behind
them
creating
a
second
opening
a
hand
ripped
away
the
striped
chintz
and
another
imperial
guard
entered
weapon
in
hand
jesus
shirin
get
back
hawksworth
shouted
in
english
and
shoved
her
across
his
sea
chest
sending
her
tumbling
away
from
the
second
attacker
as
she
fell
he
saw
her
grab
the
pocket
pistol
lying
on
the
table
and
turn
to
face
the
guard
approaching
her
hawksworth
felt
a
blade
rip
through
the
jerkin
in
his
hand
and
tangle
in
the
leather
he
shoved
the
jerkin
and
sword
aside
and
cut
upward
with
his
own
blade
miraculously
imbedding
it
in
the
exposed
neck
of
the
turbaned
guard
the
man
yelled
out
and
dropped
his
weapon
which
slid
harmlessly
onto
the
carpet
then
he
stumbled
and
fell
forward
holding
his
neck
still
incredulous
hawksworth
looked
up
to
see
two
more
imperial
guards
standing
in
the
doorway
behind
him
both
with
drawn
swords
as
he
moved
to
keep
them
at
bay
with
his
own
weapon
he
turned
and
saw
the
guard
who
had
entered
through
the
side
of
the
tent
advancing
menacingly
toward
shirin
just
as
the
guard
raised
his
weapon
hawksworth
heard
a
sharp
report
followed
by
a
moan
and
watched
the
man
crumple
and
fall
directly
in
front
of
her
smoking
pistol
as
he
fell
two
more
guards
appeared
at
the
opening
behind
him
and
began
pushing
their
way
through
shirin
the
lamp
again
he
shouted
in
english
before
realizing
she
could
not
understand
without
waiting
he
grabbed
the
open
oil
lamp
and
flung
it
against
the
uniforms
of
the
guards
bathing
them
in
burning
oil
their
turbans
and
hair
ignited
and
they
pulled
back
against
the
side
of
the
tent
slapping
at
the
flames
he
turned
back
to
the
doorway
in
time
to
see
the
other
two
guards
coming
toward
him
as
he
attempted
to
parry
them
away
he
found
his
feet
tangled
in
the
leather
jerkin
on
the
carpet
and
he
stumbled
backward
losing
his
balance
long
enough
for
one
of
the
attackers
to
bring
his
sword
around
with
a
heavy
sweep
and
knock
his
own
weapon
spinning
into
the
dark
recesses
of
the
tent
as
he
grabbed
a
tent
pole
for
balance
he
suddenly
noticed
the
dark
outline
of
two
more
men
approaching
behind
the
guards
at
the
door
in
the
shadows
he
could
tell
they
were
shirtless
wearing
only
dirty
loincloths
and
the
gray
turbans
of
servants
they
carried
no
weapons
and
had
been
attracted
by
the
uproar
looking
quickly
around
the
tent
he
noticed
the
burning
outline
of
his
powder
horn
lying
on
the
carpet
near
his
feet
he
kicked
it
toward
the
approaching
guard
and
as
it
struck
his
leg
the
cap
jarred
free
sending
hissing
powder
flaming
through
the
tent
the
man
stumbled
backward
in
surprise
and
lowered
his
sword
just
as
he
did
hawksworth
saw
one
of
the
servants
standing
at
the
doorway
slip
a
naked
katar
from
his
loincloth
and
seize
the
guard
by
the
neck
he
pulled
the
attacker
around
and
with
a
flash
of
steel
gutted
him
silently
with
a
savage
upward
thrust
the
other
imperial
guard
at
the
doorway
turned
just
in
time
to
watch
the
katar
drawn
by
the
second
servant
enter
his
own
throat
hawksworth
stared
in
astonishment
realizing
he
had
never
before
seen
the
two
servants
even
now
their
faces
were
largely
obscured
by
the
loose
ends
of
their
turbans
he
revolved
to
see
the
other
two
guards
turning
back
toward
the
opening
that
had
been
cut
through
the
side
of
the
tent
still
slapping
at
the
burning
oil
on
their
uniforms
as
they
reached
the
opening
they
seemed
to
hesitate
momentarily
then
stumbled
backward
as
they
sprawled
across
the
carpet
in
front
of
him
their
throats
cut
he
saw
two
more
grimy
servants
standing
in
the
opening
holding
bloody
katars
the
burning
oil
blazed
across
the
fringe
of
a
carpet
and
suddenly
the
interior
of
the
tent
was
crisscrossed
with
fire
the
four
alien
servants
all
still
holding
katars
seemed
to
ignore
the
flames
as
they
advanced
on
shirin
and
hawksworth
without
a
word
he
watched
them
for
a
moment
in
horror
then
reached
and
groped
blindly
across
the
top
of
his
sea
chest
it
was
bare
then
he
remembered
shirin
fall
and
he
felt
along
the
carpet
behind
the
chest
next
to
where
she
stood
just
as
the
first
man
reached
the
edge
of
the
chest
hawksworth
hand
closed
around
the
handle
of
his
katar
jesus
what
do
they
want
did
they
kill
the
imperial
guards
so
they
could
have
the
pleasure
of
murdering
us
themselves
bracing
himself
against
the
side
of
the
chest
he
swung
the
blade
upward
he
still
could
not
see
the
attacker
face
masked
behind
the
end
of
his
turban
the
man
stepped
deftly
to
the
side
and
caught
hawksworth
wrist
in
a
grip
of
iron
laughing
out
loud
never
try
to
kill
a
rajput
with
his
own
katar
captain
hawksworth
he
knows
its
temperament
too
well
vasant
rao
flipped
back
the
ragged
end
of
his
turban
what
the
bloody
hell
we
been
waiting
for
you
by
shirin
tent
it
would
appear
your
welcome
here
has
run
out
he
glanced
mockingly
at
shirin
so
much
for
your
famous
muslim
hospitality
you
know
very
well
who
responsible
her
eyes
snapped
back
at
him
i
can
probably
guess
vasant
rao
released
hawksworth
wrist
and
stared
about
the
burning
tent
are
you
ready
to
ride
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
here
this
is
hardly
the
spot
for
long
explanations
the
fact
is
i
here
tonight
to
lead
some
of
our
friends
back
to
the
camp
of
his
highness
the
prince
and
you
if
you
cared
to
join
us
vasant
rao
signaled
the
men
around
him
to
move
out
through
the
doorway
the
smoke
was
already
growing
dense
i
afraid
your
fire
has
made
our
departure
that
much
more
difficult
it
was
a
particularly
good
idea
on
your
part
now
we
have
to
ride
quickly
what
about
all
this
hawksworth
looked
about
the
burning
tent
i
have
to
just
roll
what
you
need
in
a
carpet
if
you
going
with
us
have
to
leave
now
before
the
entire
imperial
army
comes
to
see
us
off
but
who
want
to
kill
us
hawksworth
still
could
not
move
as
he
stared
through
the
smoke
whoever
it
was
they
probably
succeed
if
we
wait
here
talking
much
longer
hawksworth
turned
on
shirin
you
knew
i
could
tell
you
before
it
would
have
been
too
dangerous
she
quickly
grabbed
a
carpet
from
the
floor
stamping
out
the
burning
fringe
then
flipped
open
hawksworth
chest
she
grabbed
his
lute
a
handful
of
clothes
his
boots
his
books
and
his
depleted
purse
as
he
watched
in
a
daze
she
rolled
them
in
the
carpet
and
shoved
it
into
his
hands
he
looked
around
the
burning
tent
one
last
time
and
caught
the
glint
of
his
sword
lying
behind
a
tent
pole
he
grabbed
it
scooped
up
his
pistol
and
jerkin
and
took
shirin
by
the
arm
as
they
pushed
through
the
smoke
toward
the
entrance
stepping
over
the
bodies
of
the
guards
as
they
emerged
into
the
night
air
ahead
beside
shirin
tent
waited
saddled
horses
and
a
group
of
turbaned
riders
as
they
ran
toward
the
horses
hawksworth
recognized
several
rajputs
from
arangbar
private
guard
among
the
horsemen
we
were
ready
to
ride
vasant
rao
seized
the
rein
of
one
of
the
horses
and
vaulted
into
the
saddle
you
were
out
walking
or
we
could
have
left
sooner
shirin
demanded
we
wait
it
was
well
we
did
lord
krishna
still
seems
to
be
watching
over
you
captain
which
way
are
we
headed
hawksworth
helped
shirin
into
a
saddle
watching
as
she
uncertainly
grabbed
the
horn
for
balance
then
still
clasping
the
bundle
pulled
himself
onto
a
pawing
arabian
mare
west
the
rest
of
the
men
are
already
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
valley
vasant
rao
whipped
his
horse
and
led
the
way
as
they
galloped
toward
the
perimeter
of
the
tent
city
this
will
be
a
long
ride
my
friend
as
hawksworth
watched
the
last
of
the
tents
recede
into
the
dark
he
saw
disappearing
with
them
his
final
chance
for
a
firman
he
would
never
see
arangbar
again
probably
he
would
never
see
london
again
i
traded
it
all
for
a
woman
and
i
still
wonder
if
she
mine
god
help
me
book
five
prince
jadar
chapter
hawksworth
heard
the
exultant
cheer
of
the
rajputs
riding
behind
him
and
snapped
awake
it
was
midmorning
of
the
third
day
and
he
had
been
dozing
fitfully
in
the
saddle
since
dawn
fatigue
deep
in
his
bones
through
the
trees
ahead
the
camp
of
prince
jadar
lay
spread
before
them
blanketing
half
the
valley
i
told
you
we
make
the
camp
in
three
days
ride
vasant
rao
smiled
wearily
at
hawksworth
and
spurred
his
lathered
mount
forward
every
man
with
us
is
eager
to
be
with
the
prince
they
had
covered
it
seemed
to
hawksworth
well
over
a
hundred
miles
since
departing
the
environs
of
fatehpur
between
five
and
six
hundred
rajputs
rode
behind
them
all
heavily
armed
with
an
array
of
swords
pikes
clubs
each
man
body
armor
a
woven
network
of
steel
and
the
quilted
garment
worn
beneath
it
was
secured
behind
his
saddle
ready
to
be
donned
for
combat
hanging
at
the
side
of
each
rider
was
a
round
leather
shield
and
a
large
quiver
containing
his
horn
bow
and
arrows
none
carried
muskets
hawksworth
glanced
back
at
shirin
who
rode
a
few
paces
behind
and
they
shared
a
tired
smile
she
had
ridden
the
distance
like
a
rajput
but
now
her
eyes
were
glazed
with
weariness
he
had
suddenly
realized
the
morning
after
they
all
galloped
out
of
the
camp
at
fatehpur
that
he
had
never
before
seen
a
woman
in
india
ride
where
had
she
learned
he
had
pondered
the
question
for
an
hour
riding
behind
her
to
watch
her
easy
posture
in
the
saddle
and
then
he
had
pulled
alongside
and
asked
her
she
said
nothing
merely
smiled
and
tossed
the
loose
strands
of
hair
back
from
her
face
he
understood
her
well
enough
to
know
this
meant
she
had
never
ridden
before
and
did
wish
vasant
rao
to
know
this
is
the
moment
i
waited
for
so
long
she
reined
her
mount
alongside
hawksworth
reached
out
and
touched
his
hand
you
must
help
the
prince
now
too
i
not
so
sure
i
eager
to
die
for
prince
jadar
you
can
always
go
back
to
agra
and
wait
to
be
murdered
by
guards
the
prince
has
saved
your
life
and
mine
once
already
what
makes
you
think
he
bother
with
you
again
to
tell
the
truth
he
also
saved
my
life
several
months
ago
the
night
we
made
landfall
at
surat
and
were
ambushed
on
the
tapti
river
by
the
portugals
i
know
she
spurred
her
horse
ahead
i
received
the
pigeon
from
prince
jadar
ordering
it
i
passed
the
message
to
the
shahbandar
mirza
nuruddin
who
sent
his
personal
rajputs
to
protect
you
hawksworth
urged
his
horse
back
alongside
so
i
was
right
you
were
one
of
jadar
agents
in
surat
what
did
nadir
sharif
once
call
them
i
gathered
information
for
the
prince
she
smiled
in
consent
i
kept
his
accounts
and
coded
his
ciphers
at
the
old
observatory
then
you
came
along
and
started
combing
through
it
you
made
my
work
that
much
more
difficult
i
never
knew
when
you
decide
to
go
out
there
or
what
you
find
why
did
you
just
tell
me
what
did
i
care
too
much
was
at
risk
the
prince
once
said
never
to
trust
a
hawksworth
laughed
but
surely
mukarrab
khan
knew
what
you
were
doing
i
think
he
probably
guessed
but
what
could
he
do
he
was
only
the
governor
not
allah
he
finally
forbade
me
to
go
into
the
palace
grounds
alone
when
i
refused
to
obey
he
thought
of
sending
you
to
the
observatory
just
to
annoy
me
she
smoothed
the
mane
of
her
horse
so
i
think
he
knew
i
was
doing
something
there
but
he
was
too
entangled
by
his
own
intrigues
for
janahara
to
really
care
mukarrab
khan
worked
for
the
queen
how
two
ways
naturally
he
gathered
intelligence
for
her
mainly
about
the
portuguese
but
he
also
collected
her
portuguese
revenues
at
the
ports
of
surat
and
cambay
her
revenues
i
thought
all
duties
went
to
the
moghul
imperial
treasury
shirin
stifled
a
smile
that
what
arangbar
thinks
too
and
at
surat
it
mostly
true
she
collects
very
little
mirza
nuruddin
despises
her
and
always
finds
devious
ways
to
muddle
her
accounts
probably
keeping
some
of
her
money
for
himself
but
the
shahbandar
at
the
port
of
cambay
where
mukarrab
khan
used
to
go
every
two
weeks
would
accept
bribes
from
the
portuguese
to
undervalue
their
goods
and
then
split
the
money
with
mukarrab
khan
and
janahara
she
paused
to
watch
a
bird
dart
past
arangbar
could
never
understand
why
his
revenue
from
cambay
was
so
low
i
heard
he
thinking
about
closing
the
port
she
laughed
if
only
he
knew
it
going
mostly
to
janahara
hawksworth
rode
silently
for
a
moment
thinking
you
know
nadir
sharif
once
proposed
the
same
arrangement
for
english
goods
if
i
would
trade
with
him
personally
through
the
port
of
cambay
i
ignored
him
i
suspected
he
planned
to
find
some
way
to
confiscate
the
goods
later
on
claiming
nonpayment
of
duty
no
on
that
i
think
nadir
sharif
would
have
been
very
fair
he
always
honors
his
agreements
with
friend
or
foe
she
looked
ahead
her
weary
eyes
brightening
as
they
approached
the
first
jumble
of
tents
and
roaming
livestock
that
formed
the
edge
of
the
camp
servants
in
soiled
leading
camels
bearing
huge
baskets
of
fodder
along
the
makeshift
streets
between
the
tents
but
their
swindle
will
be
finished
when
prince
jadar
becomes
moghul
he
despises
the
portuguese
traders
and
their
christian
priests
the
perimeter
of
the
compound
reserved
for
jadar
and
his
clearly
visible
now
towering
above
the
center
of
the
camp
it
was
bordered
by
a
wall
of
billowing
red
chintz
decorated
with
a
white
hem
at
the
top
and
held
up
with
gilded
poles
spaced
no
more
than
two
feet
apart
spreading
out
around
it
were
clusters
of
smaller
tents
red
and
white
striped
cloth
for
noblemen
and
onesided
shelters
ranging
from
brocade
to
ragged
blankets
for
their
troops
the
prince
asked
that
we
all
ride
directly
to
the
his
personal
compound
vasant
rao
shouted
back
over
his
shoulder
at
hawksworth
i
think
he
particularly
want
to
see
you
captain
cheers
erupted
as
they
entered
the
camp
tents
emptied
and
infantrymen
lined
the
sides
of
the
wide
avenue
leading
to
jadar
compound
beating
their
swords
against
their
leather
shields
as
hawksworth
studied
the
forest
of
flying
standards
spreading
out
on
either
side
he
suddenly
realized
that
each
was
flying
his
own
insignia
above
his
cluster
of
tents
ahead
rising
upward
from
the
center
of
jadar
compound
was
a
pole
some
fifty
feet
high
with
a
huge
vessel
of
burning
oil
secured
on
its
tip
hawksworth
examined
the
flame
with
astonishment
then
drew
his
horse
alongside
vasant
rao
why
there
a
light
in
the
middle
of
the
camp
it
can
be
seen
for
miles
that
called
the
captain
the
light
of
heaven
it
the
great
camp
light
and
it
used
by
everyone
to
keep
their
bearings
at
night
how
else
could
a
man
find
his
tent
there
are
probably
fifty
thousand
men
here
with
their
women
and
servants
in
the
evenings
after
all
the
fires
are
lighted
for
cooking
it
so
smoky
here
you
ca
see
your
own
tent
till
you
practically
in
it
this
camp
a
town
almost
the
size
of
london
how
do
the
people
live
the
camp
bazaar
travels
with
us
captain
but
you
right
it
is
a
city
merely
one
that
moves
he
gestured
around
them
the
prince
of
course
has
his
own
personal
supplies
but
everyone
else
must
shift
for
himself
see
those
small
tents
on
the
street
over
there
between
those
two
high
poles
bearing
standards
that
one
of
the
bazaars
for
the
hindu
merchants
who
follow
the
army
and
sell
grain
oil
rice
everything
you
find
in
any
town
they
feed
the
men
the
horses
are
fed
by
sending
servants
out
to
gather
fodder
they
cut
grass
and
bring
it
back
on
camels
or
baggage
ponies
or
even
on
their
own
head
on
a
long
campaign
many
of
the
men
bring
their
women
to
cook
and
carry
water
the
women
have
to
bring
water
from
any
wells
or
streams
nearby
he
laughed
incidentally
i
should
warn
you
the
prices
these
are
as
inflated
as
the
market
will
bear
for
once
i
ca
fault
the
merchants
they
may
well
be
out
of
buyers
soon
vasant
rao
snorted
and
whipped
his
horse
ahead
they
were
approaching
the
entry
to
jadar
compound
a
wide
silk
awning
with
the
banners
flying
from
atop
its
posts
on
either
side
stood
rows
of
ornate
red
tents
with
yellow
fringe
along
the
eaves
as
hawksworth
rode
by
he
noticed
a
high
open
tent
on
the
left
holding
caged
hunting
leopards
next
to
it
stood
a
massive
canopy
surrounded
by
guards
sheltering
light
artillery
he
squinted
against
the
sun
to
look
inside
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
several
dozen
cannon
mounted
on
carriages
he
also
noticed
swivel
guns
fitted
with
a
harness
on
their
base
obviously
intended
to
be
mounted
atop
elephants
or
camels
in
the
center
were
several
stacks
of
indian
muskets
wrapped
in
cloth
the
last
tent
on
the
left
adjacent
to
the
gate
sheltered
several
gilded
palanquins
and
a
row
of
immaculate
bullock
carts
for
jadar
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
avenue
was
a
row
of
stables
for
elephants
camels
and
horses
turbaned
grooms
were
busy
brushing
the
animals
and
fitting
harness
next
to
the
stables
were
quarters
for
the
superintendents
does
all
this
belong
to
jadar
these
are
for
the
prince
his
women
and
guards
each
nobleman
also
has
his
own
stables
and
light
artillery
the
top
command
is
split
three
ways
with
separate
field
commanders
for
the
rajputs
for
the
muslims
for
the
men
of
moghul
descent
vasant
rao
smiled
reflectively
always
wisest
not
to
mix
for
one
thing
each
needs
its
own
bazaar
no
rajput
would
eat
food
handled
by
an
untouchable
muslim
their
horses
drew
into
the
shade
of
the
awning
above
the
entrance
to
the
gulal
bar
vasant
rao
and
the
other
rajputs
reined
in
their
mounts
and
began
to
dismount
this
is
the
captain
hawksworth
the
entry
to
his
highness
private
compound
vasant
rao
waved
toward
the
red
awning
come
you
be
welcomed
warmly
by
the
prince
i
promise
you
i
know
he
hoped
you
join
him
hawksworth
swung
down
from
his
dark
mare
and
stroked
her
one
last
time
wiping
away
the
lather
around
the
saddle
then
he
turned
to
help
shirin
alight
she
leaned
over
and
dropped
into
his
arms
the
sweat
of
exhaustion
mingled
with
her
perfume
grooms
from
jadar
stables
were
already
waiting
as
they
took
the
horses
the
leader
of
the
rajput
riders
shouted
staccato
orders
to
them
in
urdu
the
lingua
franca
of
the
camp
then
turned
and
dismissed
his
men
who
immediately
swaggered
into
the
gathering
crowd
to
embrace
old
acquaintances
his
highness
is
expecting
you
vasant
rao
smiled
and
bowed
lightly
to
the
rajput
commander
who
was
tan
and
beardless
save
for
a
small
moustache
with
a
white
skirt
a
small
turban
of
braided
gold
cloth
and
a
katar
in
a
red
waist
sash
the
rajput
nodded
then
adjusted
his
turban
and
retrieved
a
tightly
wrapped
brocade
bundle
from
behind
his
saddle
as
he
led
the
way
through
the
vasant
rao
turned
and
motioned
for
hawksworth
and
shirin
to
follow
jadar
guards
directed
them
along
a
pathway
of
carpets
leading
through
the
outer
barbican
ahead
was
another
gate
decorated
with
striped
chintz
and
sealed
with
a
hanging
tapestry
as
they
approached
it
the
guards
swept
the
tapestry
aside
and
ushered
them
through
the
second
compound
was
floored
entirely
with
carpets
and
in
its
center
stood
an
open
satin
canopy
held
aloft
by
four
gilded
poles
the
canopy
shaded
a
rich
persian
carpet
and
a
throne
fashioned
from
velvet
bolsters
several
men
with
kettledrums
and
long
brass
trumpets
were
waiting
nearby
as
hawksworth
watched
two
eunuchs
emerged
through
a
curtain
at
the
far
gate
and
lifted
it
high
while
a
fanfare
of
drums
and
trumpets
filled
the
air
prince
jadar
strolled
jauntily
through
the
entryway
alone
he
was
dressed
formally
with
an
elaborate
silk
cloak
in
pastel
blue
and
a
jeweled
turban
that
reminded
hawksworth
of
the
one
worn
by
the
moghul
himself
the
brocade
sash
at
his
waist
held
a
heavy
katar
with
a
ruby
on
each
side
of
the
handle
his
beard
was
accenting
his
dark
eyes
nothing
about
him
suggested
the
appearance
of
a
man
facing
impending
defeat
nimaste
mahdu
my
old
friend
jadar
walked
directly
to
the
rajput
commander
grasped
the
man
turban
and
pressed
it
to
his
own
breast
how
long
since
we
sat
together
and
ate
your
udaipur
the
same
dish
the
new
year
festival
of
years
past
highness
in
my
brother
palace
and
i
wore
the
gold
cloak
you
gave
me
in
honor
of
the
treaty
between
your
armies
and
his
five
years
before
and
tonight
we
will
dine
together
again
he
smiled
if
my
cooks
can
find
enough
all
the
bazaars
to
sweeten
your
seeing
you
again
highness
sweetens
my
tongue
already
he
bowed
and
produced
the
brocade
bundle
my
brother
the
sends
this
unworthy
token
together
with
his
prayers
for
your
victory
a
eunuch
stepped
forward
and
brought
it
to
jadar
when
the
prince
opened
the
wrapping
a
scabbard
holding
a
sword
glistened
in
the
mid
morning
light
he
does
me
honor
a
rajput
blade
knows
its
friends
and
its
foes
jadar
smiled
as
he
brushed
the
sword
handle
next
he
drew
out
the
blade
and
tested
its
edge
with
his
finger
the
rajput
watched
as
jadar
sheathed
the
sword
then
lifted
the
katar
from
his
own
belt
to
honor
him
i
grant
his
brother
my
own
katar
may
its
blade
soon
be
crimson
with
the
blood
of
his
foes
the
rajput
bowed
as
he
received
the
knife
jadar
admired
his
new
sword
a
moment
longer
then
continued
how
many
of
our
friends
rode
west
with
you
half
a
thousand
highness
more
would
have
joined
us
now
but
i
thought
it
unwise
your
highness
will
understand
why
but
those
who
did
come
i
picked
carefully
twenty
officers
of
superior
class
and
the
rest
first
and
second
class
the
eunuchs
watched
your
banners
enter
the
camp
i
already
heard
some
of
the
names
the
prince
voice
rose
i
think
you
gutted
the
rajput
field
command
in
the
imperial
army
not
entirely
highness
ah
but
i
know
you
did
jadar
smiled
and
leaned
forward
dropping
his
voice
again
and
switching
from
turki
to
rajasthani
the
tent
poles
here
can
repeat
my
words
he
drew
himself
erect
again
and
signaled
for
a
tray
of
pan
leaves
from
the
eunuchs
a
tent
has
been
prepared
for
you
tonight
we
will
dine
again
from
the
same
dish
and
you
can
tell
me
how
many
cranes
you
bagged
on
pichola
lake
last
winter
the
rajput
clasped
his
hands
together
and
bowed
lightly
before
taking
a
pan
leaf
tonight
highness
as
mahdu
marched
regally
back
through
the
entryway
jadar
turned
and
studied
shirin
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
then
he
motioned
her
forward
and
smiled
toward
vasant
rao
and
who
else
did
you
bring
yet
another
old
friend
shirin
salaamed
lightly
i
thank
your
highness
for
still
remembering
me
i
remember
you
very
well
but
the
last
i
heard
janahara
had
ordered
you
imprisoned
i
astonished
to
see
you
still
alive
i
was
released
by
arangbar
highness
after
samad
was
executed
she
tried
unsuccessfully
to
diguise
the
fatigue
in
her
voice
i
still
do
not
know
why
perhaps
it
was
his
weakness
for
beauty
jadar
smiled
but
just
now
i
think
you
need
rest
mumtaz
has
asked
me
to
invite
you
to
stay
with
her
in
the
shirin
stays
with
me
hawksworth
heard
his
own
voice
abruptly
rising
above
his
exhaustion
jadar
turned
and
studied
him
for
a
moment
then
laughed
out
loud
suddenly
i
understand
many
many
things
mumtaz
was
right
after
all
why
is
it
women
always
seem
to
see
these
things
so
clearly
his
gaze
swept
hawksworth
tattered
jerkin
well
how
are
you
captain
hawksworth
still
alive
i
see
just
as
i
foretold
and
still
the
fashionable
english
ambassador
there
is
no
other
unfortunately
however
my
mission
was
not
a
complete
success
first
india
must
have
a
just
rule
then
trade
can
be
conducted
with
an
even
hand
jadar
leaned
back
on
his
bolster
tell
me
captain
have
you
seen
enough
of
agra
and
court
intrigue
to
rethink
the
matter
we
once
discussed
i
probably
seen
all
of
agra
i
ever
see
hawksworth
fixed
jadar
squarely
but
then
i
have
much
company
jadar
sobered
and
regarded
hawksworth
a
moment
in
silence
i
see
time
still
has
not
mellowed
you
or
taught
you
very
much
do
you
understand
anything
at
all
of
land
tactics
sea
captain
hawksworth
i
never
claimed
to
but
i
can
count
infantry
jadar
laughed
again
you
still
amuse
me
captain
i
never
know
why
it
saddens
me
there
be
so
few
occasions
for
us
to
pass
the
time
together
during
the
next
few
days
but
at
least
let
me
show
you
around
my
compound
you
see
the
next
moghul
of
india
does
not
campaign
entirely
like
a
destitute
arab
why
do
we
start
with
your
fortifications
jadar
roared
as
he
lifted
nimbly
from
his
bolster
throne
and
walked
into
the
sunshine
then
he
paused
and
turned
to
shirin
join
us
if
you
wish
and
by
the
way
where
you
decided
to
stay
shirin
looked
at
hawksworth
for
a
moment
and
their
eyes
locked
then
he
saw
a
smile
flicker
across
her
face
i
stay
with
the
english
ambassador
highness
as
you
wish
jadar
tone
was
wistful
i
no
longer
try
to
reason
with
the
mind
of
a
woman
but
just
let
me
caution
you
if
you
stay
among
the
muslims
here
their
women
will
spit
on
you
unless
you
put
on
a
veil
they
never
heard
of
persia
then
we
stay
with
the
rajputs
shirin
tossed
her
head
and
followed
along
as
jadar
led
them
through
a
side
exit
in
the
interior
chintz
wall
and
into
the
outer
perimeter
of
the
compound
the
kettledrums
thundered
jadar
exit
this
side
is
for
food
captain
jadar
gestured
toward
a
row
of
ornate
tents
that
lined
the
inside
of
the
chintz
walls
the
first
is
for
fruit
and
melons
no
man
can
campaign
without
them
particularly
if
he
has
a
hungry
the
tent
over
there
is
for
making
and
that
one
is
for
keeping
betel
leaves
to
make
jadar
smiled
try
denying
a
woman
her
betel
and
you
have
nothing
but
squabbles
he
led
them
on
pointing
as
he
walked
the
large
tent
there
is
the
kitchen
the
one
beyond
it
the
bakery
and
the
one
past
that
for
grinding
spices
hawksworth
found
himself
astonished
who
could
lead
an
army
amid
such
extravagance
the
tents
were
all
red
satin
with
gilded
poles
around
the
outside
giving
them
the
appearance
of
luxurious
pavilions
some
like
the
one
for
fruits
and
melons
were
raised
on
a
platform
above
the
ground
while
others
were
with
an
interior
stair
as
he
watched
the
servants
scurry
from
tent
to
tent
bearing
silver
trays
he
found
it
difficult
to
remember
a
war
was
looming
you
soon
discover
traveling
with
women
is
always
burdensome
captain
for
example
on
the
other
side
of
the
bar
had
to
erect
a
special
tent
just
for
their
perfumes
another
for
their
tailors
another
to
hold
their
wardrobes
then
there
a
tent
for
mattresses
one
for
basins
and
one
for
lamps
and
oil
these
women
rule
my
life
the
things
i
really
need
workshops
guardhouses
my
arsenal
i
had
to
situate
back
behind
the
near
where
the
servingwomen
stay
jadar
paused
his
eyes
gleaming
mischievously
well
what
do
you
think
i
think
an
army
camp
should
have
fewer
women
and
more
men
jadar
laughed
and
looked
pointedly
at
shirin
but
what
is
life
without
women
captain
wives
do
travel
with
an
army
in
europe
then
europe
could
learn
something
from
india
about
fighting
or
about
women
before
you
through
you
may
learn
a
few
thing
about
both
jadar
turned
and
started
back
down
the
row
of
tents
war
here
is
very
different
from
wars
on
the
seas
captain
you
should
see
my
men
fight
before
you
judge
them
but
my
question
now
is
whether
you
know
how
to
fight
well
enough
to
be
of
any
help
tell
me
can
you
handle
a
bow
armies
do
use
bows
in
england
any
more
i
certainly
never
used
one
i
think
the
last
time
bows
were
issued
for
battle
was
back
around
the
time
of
the
spanish
armada
about
thirty
years
ago
some
of
the
local
forces
in
devonshire
equipped
eight
hundred
men
with
longbows
jadar
paused
uncertainly
what
do
you
mean
by
it
a
bow
about
five
feet
in
length
the
best
ones
are
made
of
yew
but
they
also
made
from
ash
and
elm
you
mean
your
bows
are
made
entirely
from
wood
jadar
voice
betrayed
his
skepticism
what
weight
did
they
pull
i
do
know
exactly
but
they
were
powerful
enough
you
can
draw
a
longbow
all
the
way
back
to
your
ear
during
the
time
of
king
harry
it
was
forbidden
to
practice
with
a
longbow
using
a
range
less
than
a
full
furlong
the
english
longbow
drove
the
crossbow
right
out
of
europe
i
heard
it
said
a
longbow
can
pierce
a
oak
door
but
you
do
use
them
now
we
prefer
muskets
he
seemed
to
ponder
the
answer
as
he
led
them
back
into
his
carpeted
reception
area
he
took
his
place
beneath
the
canopy
then
turned
to
hawksworth
we
use
muskets
too
but
frankly
they
often
more
trouble
than
they
worth
they
cumbersome
and
inaccurate
and
while
reloading
and
priming
your
matchlock
a
rajput
archer
will
put
half
a
dozen
arrows
through
you
infantry
here
normally
is
matchlock
men
and
archers
if
you
going
to
be
any
help
to
us
captain
you
need
to
learn
to
use
a
bow
jadar
stopped
and
turned
to
look
at
shirin
her
eyes
were
fluttering
with
fatigue
but
i
forget
my
manners
you
must
have
some
rest
while
we
teach
the
to
fight
perhaps
the
best
thing
would
be
to
clear
a
tent
for
you
at
the
rear
of
the
near
the
workshops
and
the
english
captain
can
stay
there
too
jadar
laughed
so
i
can
watch
him
practice
his
bow
he
glanced
back
at
hawksworth
and
his
eyes
froze
on
the
pearl
earring
i
see
you
a
now
as
well
as
an
ambassador
congratulations
if
arangbar
can
make
you
a
i
can
surely
make
you
an
archer
jadar
motioned
to
the
eunuchs
who
came
forward
and
escorted
shirin
through
the
rear
doorway
of
the
compound
hawksworth
was
watching
her
leave
praying
for
sleep
himself
when
jadar
voice
brought
him
back
let
me
begin
by
explaining
our
indian
bow
to
you
captain
i
think
it
probably
quite
different
from
the
english
bow
you
described
jadar
turned
to
vasant
rao
and
motioned
toward
his
quiver
a
flat
leather
case
hanging
from
a
strap
over
one
shoulder
it
was
covered
with
gold
embossing
and
held
both
his
bow
and
his
arrows
you
know
we
have
a
proverb
the
sword
is
better
than
the
katar
the
spear
is
better
than
the
sword
the
arrow
better
than
the
spear
i
heard
muslims
claim
the
bow
and
arrow
were
first
given
to
adam
by
the
archangel
gabriel
jadar
paused
while
vasant
rao
took
out
his
bow
and
passed
it
over
now
the
first
thing
you
need
to
learn
is
how
to
string
this
it
more
difficult
than
you
might
suppose
since
a
bow
is
reflexed
curved
back
around
the
opposite
way
when
unstrung
it
stressed
against
the
strung
position
to
give
it
more
weight
on
the
pull
jadar
examined
the
bow
for
a
moment
in
fact
you
can
tell
how
much
use
a
bow
has
had
by
the
way
it
bent
when
unstrung
the
original
curve
in
this
bow
is
almost
gone
which
means
it
had
a
lot
of
use
here
hold
it
for
a
moment
hawksworth
grasped
the
bow
in
his
hand
it
was
some
four
feet
long
shaped
in
a
wide
curve
with
the
ends
bent
back
the
grip
was
velvet
with
a
design
on
the
inner
side
you
say
your
english
bows
are
made
of
wood
but
i
find
that
difficult
to
believe
this
one
is
a
composite
a
core
with
strips
of
buffalo
horn
glued
over
the
outside
and
the
outer
curve
is
lined
with
catgut
to
give
it
even
more
force
that
why
this
bow
had
to
be
sealed
on
the
outside
with
leather
we
use
leather
or
lacquer
to
protect
the
glue
from
the
dampness
of
the
monsoon
the
string
by
the
way
is
a
silk
skein
with
a
crisscross
binding
at
the
center
how
do
you
string
it
jadar
grinned
as
he
took
back
the
bow
it
not
easy
if
you
have
to
string
a
bow
while
riding
you
hook
one
end
between
the
stirrup
and
the
instep
of
your
foot
and
brace
it
backward
against
your
knee
but
usually
we
bend
it
over
our
back
he
took
the
string
in
his
hand
and
slipped
the
bow
around
his
waist
then
he
flipped
it
against
his
back
and
pulled
its
free
end
over
his
left
shoulder
inverting
the
curve
and
hooking
the
string
in
a
single
motion
it
was
done
in
an
instant
there
but
i
made
it
look
easier
than
it
is
you
should
practice
and
it
would
also
be
well
if
you
could
learn
to
string
a
bow
and
shoot
from
horseback
horseback
all
horsemen
use
a
bow
how
can
you
possibly
hit
anything
from
horseback
practice
a
good
rajput
archer
can
shoot
as
well
from
horseback
as
standing
the
uzbeks
shoot
better
as
jadar
spoke
he
was
extracting
a
heavy
ring
from
inside
his
cloak
one
side
of
the
ring
was
a
green
emerald
flat
and
square
and
half
an
inch
wide
this
is
a
a
bow
ring
to
protect
your
thumb
when
you
draw
it
also
increases
your
range
he
pushed
the
emerald
ring
over
his
thumb
notched
an
arrow
into
the
string
and
drew
it
back
effortlessly
holding
the
thin
bamboo
arrow
in
position
with
a
touch
of
his
forefinger
the
whole
sequence
had
taken
less
than
a
second
hawksworth
found
himself
staring
in
admiration
by
the
way
jadar
turned
to
vasant
rao
show
him
how
you
shoot
under
a
shield
the
rajput
turned
to
one
of
jadar
guards
whose
shield
was
hanging
loosely
from
a
shoulder
strap
he
took
the
shield
and
slipped
it
onto
his
wrist
it
was
circular
a
quarter
inch
thick
and
about
two
feet
in
diameter
and
curved
like
a
wide
bowl
the
front
was
figured
with
a
silver
ensign
and
in
the
center
were
four
steel
nailheads
which
secured
the
handgrips
on
the
back
that
shield
one
of
the
best
it
made
with
cured
rhino
hide
and
toughened
with
lacquer
you
hold
it
by
those
two
straps
attached
inside
there
in
the
center
jadar
pointed
as
vasant
rao
held
out
the
back
of
the
shield
notice
the
straps
are
large
and
loose
so
when
you
want
to
shoot
you
can
slip
your
hand
through
and
slide
the
shield
up
your
wrist
like
he
doing
now
then
your
hand
extends
out
beyond
the
rim
and
you
can
hold
the
grip
of
the
bow
but
remember
you
have
no
protection
when
shooting
so
you
learn
to
shoot
fast
or
you
wo
live
long
in
a
battle
here
try
the
shield
hawksworth
took
the
shield
and
gripped
the
leather
thongs
on
the
back
it
light
how
much
protection
does
it
give
a
shield
is
really
only
effective
against
arrows
but
a
shield
like
this
one
will
usually
deflect
musket
fire
find
a
rhino
shield
for
you
somewhere
jadar
rose
to
leave
incidentally
after
seeing
how
you
handle
that
bow
i
think
i
better
assign
you
to
the
guards
stationed
back
with
the
that
should
keep
you
well
out
of
the
battle
i
do
want
my
first
english
ambassador
dead
just
yet
he
fingered
his
long
pearl
necklace
and
studied
hawksworth
you
may
be
interested
to
know
my
reports
say
the
imperial
army
will
reach
us
in
two
days
tomorrow
i
plan
to
poison
all
the
tanks
and
water
wells
within
twenty
of
here
forcing
them
to
attack
immediately
i
hope
you
be
ready
he
turned
and
was
gone
hawksworth
awoke
at
noon
the
following
day
to
discover
work
had
begun
on
fortification
of
the
camp
he
left
shirin
sleeping
and
walked
to
the
eastern
perimeter
where
the
heavy
cannon
were
being
drawn
into
position
as
he
paused
to
study
one
of
the
cannon
he
found
himself
comparing
it
with
the
european
design
it
looked
to
be
a
bore
with
a
molded
iron
barrel
strengthened
by
brass
hoops
shrunk
around
the
outside
it
was
bolted
onto
its
own
carriage
a
flat
base
supported
by
four
solid
wooden
wheels
and
pulled
by
a
team
of
ten
white
bullocks
yoked
in
pairs
cotton
ropes
almost
two
inches
in
diameter
were
tied
around
the
breech
looped
beneath
the
axles
and
then
through
a
heavy
iron
ring
on
the
front
of
the
mount
extending
forward
to
hooks
on
the
yokes
of
the
bullocks
while
their
drivers
whipped
the
animals
forward
a
crowd
of
moustachioed
infantry
in
red
and
green
tunics
clustered
around
the
gun
carriages
pushing
a
drummer
in
an
orange
cloak
sat
astraddle
the
breech
of
the
cannon
beating
cadence
for
the
other
men
on
two
large
drums
strapped
along
each
side
of
the
barrel
a
large
bull
elephant
trailed
behind
heavy
padding
on
his
forehead
and
whenever
the
gun
carriage
bogged
the
elephant
would
be
moved
forward
to
shove
the
breech
with
his
head
as
the
cannon
were
rolled
into
position
some
fifteen
feet
apart
they
were
being
linked
to
each
other
with
heavy
ropes
of
twisted
bull
hide
the
size
and
strength
of
metal
chain
to
prevent
cavalry
from
riding
through
and
cutting
down
the
gunners
after
the
hide
ropes
were
camouflaged
with
brush
a
leather
screen
was
placed
behind
the
breech
of
each
gun
to
protect
the
gunners
when
it
fired
hawksworth
counted
approximately
three
hundred
cannon
along
the
camp
perimeter
firepots
were
being
stationed
behind
each
gun
together
with
linstocks
and
leather
barrels
of
powder
a
few
bags
of
dirt
had
been
piled
between
some
of
the
cannon
to
provide
protection
for
matchlock
men
around
the
cannon
men
were
assembling
piles
of
iron
claws
and
beyond
diggers
with
picks
and
wicker
baskets
had
begun
a
halfhearted
effort
to
start
construction
of
a
trench
he
studied
the
preparations
uneasily
for
a
moment
sensing
something
was
wrong
and
then
he
froze
there
was
no
shot
only
stacks
of
iron
claws
he
whirled
and
made
his
way
back
to
the
munitions
depot
rows
of
tents
the
shot
was
there
waiting
in
gauge
ranging
from
two
inch
to
ten
inch
but
none
had
been
moved
he
moved
on
to
other
tents
and
discovered
several
hundred
more
cannon
some
were
the
same
gauge
as
those
being
deployed
others
much
larger
all
had
been
fitted
with
harness
ready
to
be
moved
but
now
they
stood
in
long
rows
waiting
as
he
moved
onto
another
row
of
tents
pushing
through
the
swarm
of
men
and
bullocks
he
discovered
a
vast
cache
of
smaller
cannon
thousands
also
mounted
on
wooden
carriages
but
small
enough
to
be
moved
by
a
bullock
or
even
two
men
these
too
were
harnessed
and
sat
untouched
beyond
there
were
other
rows
of
tents
where
long
muskets
together
with
powder
bags
of
shot
and
a
wooden
prong
to
rest
the
barrel
on
when
firing
were
now
being
broken
out
and
distributed
to
the
infantry
the
men
were
being
armed
but
the
camp
itself
was
practically
without
fortification
hawksworth
stood
brooding
about
the
preparations
about
the
rajput
horn
bow
he
had
only
barely
learned
to
use
he
was
finally
able
to
hit
the
practice
target
a
mound
of
earth
piled
near
jadar
tent
but
shooting
under
a
shield
seemed
impossible
and
the
situation
began
to
overwhelm
him
jadar
position
was
becoming
more
hopeless
by
the
minute
he
stared
around
the
open
camp
and
decided
he
would
try
to
requisition
as
many
matchlocks
as
possible
and
perhaps
also
try
to
teach
shirin
to
shoot
in
the
time
remaining
if
they
had
muskets
he
told
himself
perhaps
they
could
somehow
defend
themselves
when
the
imperial
army
swept
through
the
camp
he
turned
and
pushed
his
way
back
toward
where
muskets
were
being
issued
men
were
walking
past
him
carrying
heavy
matchlocks
five
feet
in
length
with
a
barrel
of
rolled
steel
welded
together
end
to
end
the
barrel
was
attached
to
the
stock
by
a
broad
steel
band
and
both
were
profusely
ornamented
with
embossing
and
colored
enamel
some
of
the
muskets
had
wooden
tripods
attached
to
the
end
of
the
barrel
as
he
approached
the
munitions
tent
he
saw
vasant
rao
standing
in
its
center
issuing
orders
with
an
easy
smile
his
moustache
and
turban
as
prim
as
though
he
were
on
muster
behind
him
was
a
pile
of
muskets
each
wrapped
in
a
roll
of
green
broadcloth
hawksworth
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
then
pushed
forward
through
the
shouting
mob
he
finally
managed
to
catch
the
rajput
arm
and
pull
him
toward
the
rear
of
the
open
tent
why
are
the
cannon
being
deployed
but
they
are
captain
vasant
rao
stroked
his
moustache
and
looked
past
hawksworth
shoulder
toward
the
next
stack
of
matchlocks
but
only
the
guns
and
even
those
have
no
shot
nothing
else
has
been
moved
by
medium
bore
i
assume
you
mean
the
the
cannon
that
true
but
these
things
all
take
time
you
spending
what
little
time
you
have
left
deploying
cannon
and
those
with
no
shot
who
the
hell
is
in
charge
prince
jadar
of
course
the
are
the
key
to
his
strategy
vasant
rao
moved
past
hawksworth
and
barked
orders
for
the
next
stack
of
muskets
to
be
unstrapped
waiting
infantrymen
in
ragged
cloaks
pushed
forward
take
a
musket
captain
if
you
want
one
they
probably
of
some
small
use
when
i
finished
here
i
have
to
check
all
the
harness
on
the
the
large
guns
that
will
be
drawn
into
position
by
elephants
then
i
still
have
to
issue
the
the
small
cannon
that
are
assigned
to
teams
where
will
this
other
artillery
be
deployed
hawksworth
shouted
toward
vasant
rao
back
the
rajput
seemed
not
to
hear
as
he
paused
to
speak
to
one
of
the
men
assisting
him
then
he
turned
and
unwrapped
a
musket
selected
a
tripod
and
passed
both
to
hawksworth
the
other
man
was
bringing
a
wide
velvet
belt
from
the
back
of
the
tent
and
he
handed
it
to
hawksworth
hanging
from
it
were
a
powder
flask
bullet
pouch
priming
horn
match
cord
and
flint
and
steel
the
prince
will
issue
orders
for
deployment
of
the
after
all
been
harnessed
he
better
issue
them
soon
it
start
growing
dark
in
a
couple
of
hours
three
at
most
i
sure
he
aware
of
the
time
captain
vasant
rao
turned
and
disappeared
into
a
circle
of
bearded
rajputs
barking
orders
hawksworth
watched
him
disappear
then
turned
and
grabbed
two
more
muskets
holding
them
ahead
of
him
like
a
prow
he
pushed
his
way
back
into
the
milling
street
the
air
was
rank
with
sweat
and
the
crowds
seemed
more
disorganized
than
ever
women
jostled
in
the
streets
haggling
with
the
merchants
for
clay
jars
of
oil
while
grooms
moved
among
them
leading
prancing
horses
each
wearing
a
saddle
blanket
that
glowed
like
ancient
coin
in
the
waning
sun
hawksworth
studied
the
crowd
searching
vainly
for
some
sense
of
organization
then
turned
to
begin
working
his
way
back
toward
compound
and
his
own
tent
shirin
was
still
there
asleep
he
stood
admiring
her
again
her
soft
mouth
the
olive
skin
of
her
high
cheeks
her
shining
dark
hair
and
realized
he
loved
her
more
than
ever
dear
god
we
only
just
begun
to
live
jadar
is
a
madman
almost
without
knowing
why
he
began
to
rummage
through
the
remains
of
his
clothing
still
rolled
in
the
carpet
and
lying
where
he
had
thrown
it
his
pulse
suddenly
quickened
when
his
fingers
closed
around
a
hard
round
object
it
was
his
very
last
bottle
of
brandy
miraculously
entangled
in
the
remains
of
his
formal
doublet
if
there
was
ever
a
time
he
ripped
away
the
rotting
cork
with
his
teeth
and
pulled
deeply
on
the
brandy
twice
as
always
it
seemed
to
work
at
the
knot
in
his
gut
he
took
one
more
swallow
then
shook
shirin
she
startled
awake
and
stared
at
him
wildly
for
a
second
then
she
broke
into
a
smile
until
she
saw
the
brandy
do
you
really
need
that
now
i
need
this
and
a
lot
more
how
can
you
sleep
this
whole
camp
is
going
to
be
leveled
by
the
imperial
army
in
a
few
hours
he
stopped
and
stared
at
her
are
you
listening
only
a
fraction
of
jadar
cannon
are
deployed
most
are
still
waiting
to
be
pulled
into
position
it
unbelievable
shirin
pulled
herself
up
and
leaned
against
a
bolster
examining
him
with
weary
eyes
then
why
are
you
here
i
thought
you
decided
to
help
prince
jadar
how
can
anyone
help
him
when
he
wo
help
himself
hawksworth
took
another
burning
mouthful
of
brandy
and
stared
at
his
bow
quiver
lying
on
the
carpet
in
a
fit
of
disgust
he
kicked
it
toward
the
center
of
the
tent
shirin
watched
the
bow
fall
and
laughed
have
you
mastered
your
rajput
bow
yet
no
and
what
does
it
matter
you
know
jadar
is
outnumbered
three
to
one
hawksworth
pointed
toward
the
muskets
he
had
leaned
against
a
coil
of
rope
by
the
tent
pole
i
got
three
weapons
for
us
do
you
think
you
can
shoot
a
matchlock
i
can
shoot
a
bow
she
dismissed
the
muskets
with
a
glance
i
sincerely
hope
you
learned
enough
to
shoot
one
too
a
trumpet
sounded
from
the
center
of
the
compound
immediately
it
was
answered
by
others
the
length
of
the
camp
shirin
snapped
alert
and
rose
off
the
bolster
pulling
her
gauze
cloak
around
her
waist
that
the
signal
to
begin
preparing
the
firewood
come
at
least
you
can

hawksworth
examined
her
aghast
firewood
what
in
god
name
are
you
talking
about
is
jadar
planning
to
light
fires
is
he
worried
the
imperial
army
wo
find
our
camp
he
turned
and
walked
to
the
doorway
rubbing
his
brow
in
disbelief
i
think
there
damned
small
risk
of
that
the
red
tents
of
his
be
seen
for
miles
shirin
laughed
and
pushed
her
way
ahead
of
him
past
the
portiere
of
the
tent
servants
had
already
begun
assembling
piles
of
logs
along
the
center
of
the
walkway
that
ran
the
length
of
the
compound
hawksworth
stood
at
the
doorway
and
stared
in
astonishment
as
clay
jars
of
oil
were
carried
from
the
kitchen
tent
and
stationed
near
the
logs
as
he
watched
he
noticed
the
long
shadows
of
dusk
beginning
to
play
across
the
walls
of
nearby
tents
he
turned
to
retrieve
the
brandy
and
when
he
emerged
again
from
the
tent
shirin
was
lost
among
the
crowd
of
servants
bringing
wood
he
slipped
the
bottle
into
his
jerkin
and
started
working
his
way
down
the
side
of
the
compound
back
toward
the
munitions
tent
pairs
of
elephants
had
been
harnessed
to
the
larger
cannon
and
now
they
were
being
led
out
of
the
camp
into
the
dusk
following
these
were
camels
with
swivel
guns
mounted
on
their
backs
together
with
infantry
pulling
the
smaller
guns
after
them
on
carriages
bullock
carts
heaving
with
powder
and
shot
came
after
pyramids
of
firewood
were
scattered
among
the
tents
and
already
many
of
the
rajputs
had
assembled
by
the
unlit
piles
talking
and
embracing
some
had
seated
themselves
and
removed
their
turbans
chanting
verses
from
the
as
they
began
to
oil
and
comb
their
long
black
hair
hawksworth
watched
silently
as
they
started
passing
around
inlaid
teakwood
boxes
taking
and
eating
handfuls
of
small
brown
balls
as
he
stood
puzzling
he
recognized
vasant
rao
standing
among
the
men
the
rajput
was
somber
now
clasping
each
of
the
men
in
what
seemed
a
farewell
gesture
he
looked
up
and
saw
hawksworth
and
smiled
captain
hawksworth
i
glad
you
here
you
almost
a
rajput
yourself
by
now
do
you
want
to
comb
your
hair
it
how
we
prepare
for
what
may
happen
who
knows
which
of
us
will
see
the
morrow
i
can
die
just
as
well
with
my
hair
the
way
it
is
then
you
not
entirely
a
rajput
after
all
but
you
still
welcome
to
join
us
he
held
out
one
of
the
boxes
hawksworth
opened
the
box
and
gingerly
took
out
one
of
the
balls
as
he
rolled
it
under
his
nose
it
triggered
a
distant
memory
of
his
first
night
in
surat
and
mukarrab
khan
dinner
party
suddenly
he
stopped
dead
still
it
was
opium
jesus
christ
have
you
all
gone
mad
he
flung
the
ball
to
the
ground
and
whirled
on
vasant
rao
that
the
last
thing
you
need
if
you
hope
to
fight
at
all
it
like
eating
death
affion
prepares
a
rajput
for
battle
captain
the
more
we
eat
the
stronger
we
become
it
gives
us
the
strength
of
lions
good
jesus
help
us
all
hawksworth
pushed
his
way
incredulously
back
through
the
milling
crowd
of
infantry
and
mounted
cavalry
feeling
as
though
the
world
had
collapsed
all
around
him
rajputs
were
eating
handfuls
of
opium
combing
their
hair
embracing
in
farewell
many
had
already
put
on
their
the
quilted
vest
they
wore
under
their
armor
he
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
they
became
drunk
with
opium
and
began
killing
each
other
god
we
all
going
to
die
ca
jadar
stop
it
ca
he
at
least
stop
them
from
eating
opium
before
we
attacked
and
where
are
they
moving
the
cannon
out
of
the
camp
what
the
hell
is
happening
he
wheeled
and
headed
for
the
the
entry
to
compound
when
he
reached
it
he
realized
the
guards
were
gone
amazed
he
walked
through
the
entry
and
discovered
all
the
interior
partitions
of
the
gulal
bar
were
also
gone
the
satin
tents
that
had
held
the
melons
the
pan
leaves
the
kitchen
all
were
deserted
empty
he
made
his
way
on
through
the
deserted
gulal
bar
feeling
like
a
man
lost
in
the
dark
there
were
no
guards
no
troops
nothing
ahead
he
heard
the
sound
of
elephants
trumpeting
and
he
felt
his
way
forward
through
the
the
ground
a
mosaic
of
flickering
shadows
from
the
camp
light
his
despair
absolute
he
reached
into
the
pocket
of
his
jerkin
for
the
bottle
a
katar
was
at
his
throat
it
forbidden
by
death
to
draw
a
weapon
in
the
captain
i
was
only
there
was
an
explosion
of
laughter
and
he
turned
to
see
the
shadowed
face
of
jadar
what
what
are
you
doing
here
thinking
captain
hawksworth
do
you
never
think
before
a
battle
at
sea
surely
you
must
i
think
and
i
also
keep
my
gunners
sober
hawksworth
felt
vaguely
foolish
as
he
finished
extracting
the
brandy
bottle
do
you
know
half
your
men
are
eating
handfuls
of
opium
i
glad
to
hear
it
it
means
my
rajputs
will
be
invincible
tomorrow
jadar
flipped
the
katar
in
his
hand
and
dropped
it
into
is
leather
sheath
by
the
way
i
understand
you
failed
to
master
the
bow
but
let
talk
about
something
more
important
perhaps
you
can
be
of
help
after
all
i
sure
you
realize
captain
that
a
commander
must
always
understand
two
things
he
must
know
his
own
strengths
and
he
must
know
the
strengths
of
those
who
oppose
him
but
he
can
really
only
know
one
of
these
for
sure
he
can
never
know
exactly
what
he
will
meet
jadar
paused
tell
me
if
you
were
inayat
latif
how
would
you
deploy
the
imperial
army
tomorrow
what
do
you
mean
how
would
you
choose
to
attack
the
position
of
infantry
cavalry
elephants
is
never
exactly
the
same
in
any
battle
for
example
often
the
front
line
is
held
by
rows
of
infantry
the
first
row
will
be
men
wearing
plate
armor
which
is
much
heavier
than
the
usual
steel
netting
forming
a
protective
wall
with
special
broad
shields
they
are
always
excellent
archers
behind
these
will
be
another
row
wearing
only
helmets
and
breastplates
and
armed
with
swords
and
pikes
the
third
row
is
infantry
with
swords
bows
and
axes
the
fourth
carries
lances
and
swords
the
rows
are
segmented
so
those
behind
can
see
ahead
and
cavalry
can
get
through
that
deployment
would
mean
a
attack
and
a
very
bloody
fight
precisely
that
why
many
commanders
prefer
to
use
their
cavalry
as
the
vanguard
horsemen
can
move
faster
and
they
can
more
easily
avoid
defense
barricades
hawksworth
looked
at
jadar
wishing
he
could
see
his
eyes
but
cavalry
can
be
cut
to
ribbons
with
small
artillery
is
it
wise
to
charge
with
your
cavalry
if
your
enemy
has
heavy
gun
emplacements
he
heard
jadar
laugh
you
may
make
a
commander
yet
you
see
inayat
latif
will
naturally
assume
our
camp
is
heavily
defended
now
although
it
considered
questionable
manners
to
attack
a
camp
at
night
your
manners
become
excusable
if
you
attack
at
early
dawn
even
though
it
still
dark
i
known
of
attacks
occurring
almost
half
a
dawn
what
that
in
european
measure
an
hour
an
hour
and
a
half
but
if
it
still
dark
how
can
you
see
the
enemy
lines
you
can
see
them
if
your
enemy
camp
has
been
negligent
enough
to
leave
a
few
fires
burning
jadar
smiled
as
he
paused
to
let
the
words
sink
but
now
let
examine
the
third
possibility
leading
the
attack
with
your
elephants
elephant
armor
is
steel
plate
and
it
can
withstand
everything
except
heavy
cannon
if
you
can
entice
your
foe
into
firing
his
biggest
artillery
before
you
charge
then
you
can
send
a
wave
of
war
elephants
and
devastate
his
gunners
before
their
cannon
cool
enough
to
reload
since
it
can
take
at
least
half
a
a
large
cannon
to
cool
large
guns
are
rarely
fired
more
than
once
in
a
battle
and
never
after
your
cavalry
has
moved
out
leading
the
vanguard
with
war
elephants
always
entails
danger
since
if
they
panic
they
can
turn
around
and
trample
your
own
infantry
but
in
this
case
it
probably
worth
the
risk
and
you
think
that
what
inayat
latif
will
try
to
do
hawksworth
absently
twirled
the
brandy
bottle
in
his
hand
i
asking
you
it
sounds
the
most
plausible
he
position
his
biggest
cannon
to
fire
into
the
camp
and
after
he
drawn
your
fire
in
return
stampede
about
a
thousand
war
elephants
right
through
here
crushing
everything
in
their
path
including
your
rajputs
and
their
invincible
bows
you
doing
remarkably
well
so
far
captain
jadar
took
arm
and
guided
him
toward
the
back
of
the
compound
and
then
what
would
you
do
i
send
an
infantry
wave
right
after
the
war
elephants
with
lines
so
thick
it
would
be
a
wall
of
death
and
behind
them
i
have
cavalry
with
muskets
to
contain
the
camp
and
meet
your
own
cavalry
when
it
broke
through
as
it
probably
would
eventually
cavalrymen
would
bother
with
muskets
just
bows
but
you
still
thinking
very
clearly
now
tell
me
from
what
direction
would
you
attack
this
particular
camp
they
were
approaching
the
tents
where
servants
were
beginning
to
soak
the
wood
piles
with
oil
hawksworth
found
himself
astonished
that
jadar
would
listen
calmly
to
the
strategy
spelling
his
own
destruction
from
the
east
the
way
we
came
in
and
why
that
particular
direction
several
reasons
hawksworth
tried
to
remember
the
terrain
as
they
came
into
the
camp
first
if
i
marched
from
the
east
i
already
have
my
army
deployed
there
second
and
probably
more
important
the
only
direction
that
really
accessible
the
other
sides
are
too
forested
but
from
the
east
there
a
wide
clearing
that
funnels
down
right
into
the
perimeter
of
the
camp
with
a
very
clear
demarcation
of
forest
on
each
side
which
helps
keep
your
army
grouped
correct
and
also
the
sun
would
not
be
in
my
men
eyes
if
i
hit
you
from
the
east
jadar
stopped
and
looked
at
him
so
that
is
precisely
what
you
would
do
attack
at
dawn
on
the
eastern
perimeter
and
lead
with
a
front
line
of
war
elephants
with
the
biggest
and
best
i
had
jadar
sighed
you
know
it
troubles
me
that
a
conclude
the
same
thing
i
have
but
i
think
it
a
classic
problem
and
that
will
dictate
a
classic
solution
in
the
mind
of
inayat
latif
whose
alleged
brilliance
does
not
include
a
flair
for
originality
he
have
to
mount
a
conventional
attack
what
more
because
of
the
restricted
terrain
he
have
no
room
to
split
his
army
into
a
right
wing
and
a
left
wing
they
have
to
be
a
single
phalanx
that
dangerous
if
you
ever
need
to
retreat
but
he
not
even
consider
that
possibility
and
you
say
you
also
believe
he
hold
his
cavalry
for
the
third
wave
jadar
paused
that
more
important
here
than
you
probably
realize
everything
else
depends
on
it
the
cavalry
must
attack
last
it
seems
best
and
his
cavalry
is
mainly
rajput
he
not
risk
cutting
up
his
finest
troops
by
sending
them
in
the
first
attack
wave
when
your
artillery
is
still
in
place
hawksworth
hesitated
then
continued
bitterly
or
should
be
jadar
laughed
and
looked
at
hawksworth
then
at
his
bottle
what
that
in
your
hand
captain
a
bottle
of
brandy
spanish
i
ashamed
to
admit
but
it
still
the
best
may
i
try
it
jadar
took
the
bottle
and
gingerly
swallowed
a
swig
he
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
and
then
coughed
violently
merciful
allah
now
i
understand
why
the
prophet
forbade
its
use
he
shoved
back
the
bottle
but
i
wanted
to
drink
once
with
you
captain
i
told
it
a
european
custom
you
eased
my
mind
eased
your
mind
i
just
told
you
how
your
camp
will
be
devastated
at
sunrise
absolutely
i
will
regret
losing
these
tents
jadar
tone
grew
pensive
you
know
some
of
them
have
been
with
me
since
my
first
campaign
in
the
deccan
years
ago
how
about
your
rajputs
and
your
women
will
you
regret
losing
them
as
much
as
your
tents
i
do
expect
to
lose
them
jadar
took
hawksworth
arm
and
led
him
around
the
last
tent
in
the
firelight
baggage
elephants
were
being
loaded
with
women
from
the
the
elephants
were
covered
with
steel
plates
around
the
sides
of
their
bodies
and
a
special
steel
casement
for
their
head
and
trunk
the
women
were
being
helped
up
tall
ladders
and
into
their
elephants
an
octagonal
box
of
heavy
boards
strengthened
with
iron
plate
why
are
you
loading
the
women
now
but
we
leaving
captain
hawksworth
stared
at
him
speechlessly
for
a
moment
then
noticed
shirin
walking
toward
them
carrying
a
bow
and
two
quivers
of
arrows
you
leaving
you
just
predicted
this
camp
would
be
devastated
i
agree
with
you
entirely
in
fact
i
planned
it
that
way
so
why
should
anyone
be
here
when
it
happens
the
camp
will
be
empty
by
dawn
captain
naturally
we
had
to
wait
until
dark
to
move
out
and
continue
work
on
the
trenches
until
the
very
end
inayat
latif
undoubtedly
has
scouts
all
around
but
by
dawn
there
only
be
smoldering
fires
here
and
the
troops
needed
to
man
our
decoy
cannon
across
the
eastern
perimeter
i
loaded
half
the
cannon
with
elephant
barbs
made
in
my
workshops
the
other
half
with
nothing
why
waste
shot
we
fire
the
blank
cannon
to
induce
them
to
charge
and
after
the
elephants
have
come
inside
cannon
range
we
shoot
the
barbs
in
among
them
a
barb
in
the
foot
of
an
elephant
can
immobilize
it
completely
inayat
latif
will
never
expect
barbs
they
have
been
used
in
india
for
fifty
years
his
war
elephants
should
be
contained
right
out
there
unable
to
advance
or
retreat
but
where
will
your
army
be
captain
just
when
i
thought
you
were
beginning
to
understand
tactics
my
army
will
be
waiting
along
both
sides
of
the
open
plain
on
the
east
behind
a
foliage
camouflage
we
been
erecting
over
the
past
two
weeks
after
the
attack
force
of
imperial
war
elephants
has
been
funneled
into
the
empty
camp
we
will
open
fire
against
them
with
our
biggest
cannon
from
both
sides
the
cannon
will
fire
into
the
infantry
as
will
the
small
artillery
all
the
guns
should
be
in
place
just
before
dawn
if
i
timed
it
right
hawksworth
turned
to
see
keepers
leading
an
armored
elephant
forward
for
him
and
shirin
only
its
ears
could
be
seen
behind
the
steel
plate
then
he
looked
again
at
jadar
but
you
still
outnumbered
in
infantry
three
to
one
all
things
in
time
captain
he
turned
and
embraced
shirin
lightly
this
was
my
best
guard
her
well
shirin
examined
hawksworth
brandy
bottle
with
her
dark
eyes
and
laughed
skeptically
i
brought
my
own
bow
hawksworth
cleared
his
throat
as
he
slipped
the
bottle
back
into
his
jerkin
i
requisitioned
a
brace
of
muskets
it
still
the
weapon
i
prefer
congratulations
captain
jadar
laugh
was
cynical
i
admire
your
initiative
but
i
do
want
to
see
you
harmed
like
i
told
you
i
sending
you
with
the
they
be
moved
to
that
hilltop
there
west
of
the
camp
so
at
least
you
be
able
to
watch
the
battle
he
turned
to
leave
farewell
until
tomorrow
captain
may
allah
ride
with
you
and
i
wish
you
godspeed
you
a
ten
times
better
strategist
then
i
realized
for
whatever
it
may
be
worth
jadar
laughed
just
save
some
of
your
for
our
victory
celebration
and
perhaps
i
drink
with
you
one
more
time
his
eyes
darkened
if
not
then
tomorrow
we
be
eating
lamb
side
by
side
in
paradise
chapter
a
drum
roll
lifted
across
the
dark
plain
swelling
in
intensity
like
angry
caged
thunder
it
rose
to
fill
the
valley
with
a
foreboding
voice
of
death
then
faded
slowly
to
silence
gorged
on
its
own
immensity
that
the
imperial
army
call
to

inayat
latif
is
attacking
now
before
dawn
shirin
was
seated
next
to
hawksworth
in
the
dark
she
rose
to
peer
over
the
high
steel
rim
out
into
the
blackness
around
them
were
the
shapes
of
the
elephants
silently
swinging
their
trunks
beneath
their
armor
the
farther
back
on
female
baggage
elephants
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
bullock
carts
piled
with
clothing
and
utensils
merciful
allah
he
must
have
a
thousand
war
drums
you
saw
the
size
of
the
imperial
army
mustering
at
fatehpur
hawksworth
rose
to
stand
beside
her
grasping
the
side
of
the
rocking
inhaling
the
cold
morning
air
the
queen
had
begun
recalling
their
troops
from
every
province
suddenly
a
chorus
of
battle
horns
cut
through
the
dark
followed
by
the
drums
again
now
a
steady
pulse
that
resounded
off
the
wooded
hills
swelling
in
power
that
the
signal
for
the
men
and
cavalry
to
deploy
themselves
in
battle
array
shirin
pointed
toward
the
sound
the
imperial
forces
are
almost
ready
below
them
fires
smoldered
in
jadar
abandoned
camp
a
thousand
specks
of
winking
light
although
the
east
was
beginning
to
hint
the
first
tinges
of
light
the
valley
where
the
imperial
army
had
massed
was
still
shrouded
in
black
the
drums
suddenly
ceased
mantling
the
valley
in
eerie
portentous
quiet
hawksworth
felt
for
shirin
hand
and
noticed
it
perspiring
even
in
the
cold
dawn
air
from
the
eastern
edge
of
jadar
abandoned
camp
points
of
cannon
fire
erupted
tongues
of
light
that
divulged
the
length
and
location
of
the
camp
defenses
a
few
moments
later
less
time
than
hawksworth
would
have
wished
the
sound
reached
them
dull
pops
impotent
and
hollow
the
firing
lapsed
increasingly
sporadic
until
the
camp
weak
perimeter
defense
seemed
to
exhaust
itself
like
the
last
melancholy
thrusts
of
a
spent
lover
the
defense
perimeter
of
the
camp
had
betrayed
itself
and
in
the
tense
silence
that
ensued
hawksworth
knew
the
imperial
guns
were
being
set
suddenly
a
wall
of
flame
illuminated
the
center
of
the
plain
below
sending
rockets
of
fire
plunging
toward
the
empty
camp
jesus
they
launching
fireworks
with
cannon
what
are
they
i
do
know
i
heard
that
cannon
in
india
were
once
called
a
second
volley
followed
hard
after
the
first
although
this
time
no
fireworks
were
hurtled
the
impact
was
even
more
deadly
imperial
shot
ripped
wide
trenches
through
the
flaming
tents
of
the
prince
camp
in
moments
the
where
they
had
been
standing
only
hours
before
was
devastated
an
inferno
of
shredded
cloth
and
billowing
flame
a
harsh
chant
began
to
drift
upward
from
the
valley
swelling
as
voices
joined
in
unison
god
is
great
it
was
the
battle
cry
of
inayat
latifs
muslim
infantry
the
plain
below
had
grown
tinged
with
light
now
as
dawn
approached
and
the
fires
from
jadar
camp
spread
as
hawksworth
watched
nervously
gripping
the
handle
of
his
sword
a
force
of
war
elephants
advanced
on
the
eastern
perimeter
of
the
camp
their
polished
armor
plate
glowing
red
in
the
firelight
those
in
the
vanguard
bore
through
which
a
single
heavy
cannon
protruded
probably
a
hawksworth
told
himself
the
steel
on
the
next
rows
of
elephants
were
almost
three
feet
high
and
perforated
to
allow
their
archers
to
shoot
without
rising
above
the
open
top
sporadic
cannon
and
matchlock
fire
from
the
few
hundred
men
left
in
the
camp
pelted
the
elephants
but
did
nothing
to
impede
their
advance
directly
behind
them
the
imperial
infantry
swept
in
dense
martialed
ranks
jadar
knew
exactly
what
he
was
doing
when
he
picked
this
terrain
for
the
camp
hawksworth
told
himself
he
used
it
to
set
the
terms
for
the
battle
there
no
room
to
maneuver
when
they
discover
the
camp
is
abandoned
the
elephants
ca
retreat
and
regroup
without
crushing
their
own
infantry
he
slipped
his
arm
around
shirin
waist
and
held
her
next
to
him
they
watched
as
the
imperial
war
elephants
crashed
through
the
camp
outer
edge
scarcely
slowing
at
the
ditch
when
the
elephants
were
at
blank
range
the
specially
loaded
cannon
along
the
perimeter
opened
fire
spraying
a
rain
of
steel
barbs
among
them
even
from
the
hilltop
he
could
hear
the
clang
of
steel
as
the
barbs
ricocheted
off
their
armor
we
soon
know
if
jadar
plan
has
a
chance
can
he
contain
the
elephants
there
or
will
they
obliterate
the
camp
then
regroup
and
the
first
row
of
elephants
suddenly
reared
chaotically
lashing
out
with
their
armored
trunks
and
dismounting
some
of
the
gunners
as
barbs
caught
in
their
feet
they
trumpeted
in
pain
and
started
to
mill
randomly
in
angry
confusion
crushing
several
of
the
men
they
had
thrown
just
as
jadar
predicted
the
deadly
carpet
of
barbs
had
temporarily
disrupted
their
advance
their
ranks
were
broken
and
their
guns
in
disarray
behind
the
elephants
the
infantry
still
marched
unaware
until
the
confusion
in
the
elephant
ranks
began
to
disrupt
their
front
lines
gradually
the
order
in
the
infantry
ranks
completely
disintegrated
as
the
men
stopped
to
eye
the
milling
war
elephants
ahead
of
them
in
growing
fear
and
confusion
by
a
single
cannon
salvo
jadar
men
had
robbed
the
attack
of
its
momentum
now
jadar
moment
hawksworth
watched
in
growing
admiration
will
he
use
it
as
though
in
answer
a
blare
of
trumpets
from
the
hills
on
both
sides
of
the
plain
suddenly
electrified
the
morning
air
as
they
died
away
the
woods
opened
wide
with
a
single
chorus
deep
and
throaty
and
unforgiving
ram
ram
ram
ram
ram
ram
it
was
the
ancient
rajput
war
cry
a
blaze
of
fire
from
jadar
camouflaged
cannon
shredded
away
the
leafy
blinds
erected
along
the
foot
of
the
hills
sending
a
rain
of
pound
lead
shot
into
the
imperial
war
elephants
their
disordered
ranks
erupted
in
tangled
steel
and
blood
seconds
later
a
volley
by
small
artillery
ripped
into
the
unsuspecting
infantry
massed
behind
the
elephants
hurtling
fragmented
bodies
and
orphaned
weapons
spinning
through
the
ranks
finally
came
the
fiery
streaks
of
rockets
thin
iron
tubes
filled
with
gunpowder
and
set
with
a
lighted
fuse
many
with
a
sword
blade
attached
to
the
end
which
cut
in
a
deadly
wave
through
the
imperial
troops
slashing
and
exploding
as
they
flew
a
dense
roll
of
jadar
war
drums
sounded
from
both
hillsides
and
the
first
wave
of
rajput
cavalry
still
bellowing
their
war
cry
charged
down
on
the
disrupted
imperial
forces
discharging
volleys
of
arrows
with
mechanical
precision
they
wore
cloaks
and
helmet
guards
and
their
horses
were
armored
with
woven
steel
netting
encased
in
heavy
quilting
with
a
wide
frontlet
over
the
chest
a
collar
secured
to
the
top
of
the
bridle
and
a
body
shroud
over
their
sides
and
hindquarters
emblazoned
with
each
man
family
crest
the
startled
infantry
turned
to
meet
them
and
in
moments
the
air
darkened
with
opposing
arrows
from
the
hill
above
came
the
din
of
supporting
matchlock
fire
from
jadar
own
infantry
the
rajput
cavalry
plowed
into
the
first
rows
of
imperial
infantry
with
their
long
held
at
arm
length
high
above
their
heads
thrusting
downward
as
they
rode
veins
fueled
with
opium
the
rajputs
had
forgotten
all
fear
they
brushed
aside
imperial
spears
and
swords
and
slaughtered
with
undisguised
pleasure
as
though
each
death
endowed
more
honor
to
their
hawksworth
stomach
knotted
as
he
watched
a
thousand
men
fall
in
less
than
a
minute
while
the
rajputs
attacked
the
prince
division
of
armored
war
elephants
had
emerged
from
their
camouflage
and
begun
advancing
across
the
western
edge
of
the
plain
isolating
the
ragged
remainder
of
the
imperial
elephants
from
the
battlefield
although
jadar
had
far
fewer
war
elephants
they
now
were
easily
able
to
contain
the
shattered
imperial
forces
hawksworth
turned
to
watch
as
yet
another
wave
of
jadar
cavalry
bore
down
on
the
plain
these
rode
through
the
tangle
of
imperial
infantry
wielding
long
curved
swords
killing
any
the
first
wave
had
missed
i
not
sure
i
believe
what
i
seeing
hawksworth
peered
through
the
dust
and
smoke
boiling
across
the
plain
below
jadar
has
already
seized
the
advantage
he
immobilized
their
war
elephants
their
major
advantage
and
he
timed
the
counterattack
perfectly
the
battle
has
only
just
begun
shirin
took
his
hand
for
no
reason
at
all
and
gripped
it
and
their
major
advantage
was
not
elephants
but
numbers
i
fear
for
him
look
there
she
pointed
toward
the
east
where
the
red
sky
now
illuminated
a
vast
sea
of
infantry
poised
as
reinforcements
the
prince
rajputs
can
not
stop
them
all
prince
jadar
does
not
have
the
forces
to
meet
them
i
think
he
will
be
defeated
today
badly
and
if
he
dies
do
we
die
with
him
perhaps
not
you
but
they
will
surely
kill
me
and
probably
mumtaz
most
certainly
they
have
orders
to
kill
his
son
on
the
field
below
jadar
cavalry
fought
as
though
possessed
rajputs
with
one
two
even
three
arrows
in
their
back
continued
to
sound
their
war
cry
and
take
head
after
bearded
head
until
they
finally
slumped
unconscious
from
the
saddle
riderless
horses
many
with
their
stomachs
slashed
open
could
be
seen
running
wildly
through
the
imperial
ranks
unused
arrows
still
rattling
in
their
saddle
quivers
waves
of
jadar
infantry
had
begun
pouring
down
from
the
hills
following
the
cavalry
the
men
wore
heavy
leather
helmets
and
a
skirt
of
woven
steel
a
hood
of
steel
netting
hung
down
from
each
helmet
protecting
his
face
and
neck
they
advanced
firing
volley
after
volley
of
arrows
into
the
imperial
infantry
when
they
reached
the
plain
they
drew
their
long
curved
swords
and
waving
them
above
their
heads
threw
themselves
into
the
forces
of
inayat
latif
the
field
quickly
became
a
vast
arena
of
combat
as
inevitably
happened
when
two
indian
armies
met
with
jadar
forces
badly
outnumbered
shirin
watched
the
slaughter
in
silence
for
a
time
as
though
tallying
the
dead
and
dying
on
both
sides
and
then
she
turned
her
face
away
allah
preserve
us
prince
jadar
rajputs
have
eaten
so
much
affion
i
think
they
can
fight
even
after
they
die
but
their
numbers
are
already
shrinking
how
long
can
they
protect
the
prince
where
he
now
she
turned
back
and
peered
through
the
dust
on
the
field
for
a
long
moment
then
she
pointed
he
on
the
field
now
there
in
the
center
do
you
see
him
she
paused
he
very
courageous
to
take
the
field
so
early
it
will
inspire
his
men
but
it
a
very
bad
omen
hawksworth
squinted
toward
the
east
he
could
barely
make
out
a
phalanx
of
elephants
moving
across
the
plains
into
the
middle
of
the
fiercest
fighting
several
of
the
elephants
had
clusters
of
swivel
guns
mounted
on
their
backs
a
few
had
rocket
launchers
but
most
carried
howdahs
filled
with
rajput
archers
in
the
center
moved
a
large
black
elephant
heavily
armored
and
bearing
a
steel
with
ornate
gilding
standing
erect
in
the
howdah
beneath
a
huge
embroidered
umbrella
was
the
figure
of
prince
jadar
loosing
arrows
in
rhythmic
succession
as
the
imperial
infantry
closed
around
him
why
is
it
a
bad
sign
it
unwise
for
the
supreme
commander
of
an
army
to
expose
himself
so
early
in
the
battle
shirin
was
watching
jadar
transfixed
if
killed
the
battle
will
be
over
all
his
troops
will
flee
even
his
fearless
rajputs
that
the
way
in
india
if
he
lost
what
do
they
have
left
to
fight
for
they
will
melt
into
the
forest
in
india
a
commander
must
always
be
visible
to
his
men
standing
above
the
armor
of
his
howdah
so
they
know
for
certain
he
alive
as
the
circle
of
elephants
surrounding
jadar
advanced
through
the
field
a
triple
line
of
his
rajput
infantry
moved
into
place
around
him
he
quickly
became
the
focus
of
the
battle
and
the
imperial
infantry
massed
to
encircle
him
like
the
king
in
a
game
of
chess
his
protective
buffer
of
elephants
was
coming
under
increasingly
heavy
attack
the
advantage
of
surprise
enjoyed
by
his
original
offensive
was
gone
now
he
was
clearly
on
the
defensive
i
think
jadar
starting
to
be
in
serious
trouble
you
were
right
i
do
know
how
much
longer
his
circle
of
elephants
can
protect
him
in
the
silence
he
slowly
turned
to
shirin
and
their
eyes
met
nothing
more
was
said
because
no
more
words
were
needed
she
reached
out
and
touched
his
lips
and
a
lifetime
seemed
to
flow
between
them
then
he
drew
his
sword
and
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
howdah
yes
with
a
single
stroke
he
severed
the
tether
rope
tying
their
elephant
their
startled
mahout
turned
and
stared
in
disbelief
when
hawksworth
shouted
at
him
to
start
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
flung
his
barbed
iron
their
plunged
for
the
grass
hawksworth
grabbed
the
but
before
he
could
move
the
elephant
lifted
its
trunk
into
the
morning
air
and
emitted
a
long
defiant
trumpet
then
he
plunged
past
the
tethered
and
broke
into
a
gallop
eastward
down
the
hill
and
directly
toward
the
battle
hawksworth
staggered
backward
and
grasped
the
side
of
the
swaying
how
how
did
he
know
prince
jadar
did
give
us
a
baggage
elephant
he
gave
us
one
of
his
personal
war
elephants
to
protect
you
he
knows
where
he
should
be
now
in
only
minutes
their
elephant
reached
the
edge
of
the
plain
and
began
advancing
like
a
dreadnought
through
the
swarm
of
imperial
infantry
headed
directly
for
jadar
any
luckless
infantryman
caught
in
his
path
would
be
seized
in
his
trunk
and
flung
viciously
aside
or
simply
crushed
beneath
his
feet
but
how
could
he
know
jadar
threatened
he
knows
his
whole
life
is
to
protect
the
prince
a
steel
arrowhead
sang
off
the
side
of
the
howdah
then
another
thudded
into
one
of
the
wooden
beams
supporting
the
armor
hawksworth
grabbed
shirin
and
shoved
her
down
below
the
steel
rim
she
fell
sprawling
and
turned
to
grab
their
bows
as
hawksworth
took
them
and
began
to
notch
the
string
on
each
one
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
jadar
had
given
them
one
of
his
combat
with
firing
holes
all
around
the
sides
war
cries
and
sounds
of
steel
on
steel
ranged
around
them
as
they
advanced
but
their
elephant
seemed
oblivious
only
beginning
to
slow
when
they
approached
the
dense
lines
of
imperial
infantry
encircling
jadar
hawksworth
found
his
bow
ring
and
slipped
it
awkwardly
over
his
right
thumb
then
he
strung
an
arrow
and
took
aim
through
one
of
the
firing
holes
in
the
side
of
the
howdah
the
arrow
sang
off
his
thumb
and
glanced
harmlessly
against
the
steel
net
cloak
of
an
imperial
infantryman
the
man
looked
up
then
paused
to
aim
an
arrow
at
the
howdah
it
was
a
lethal
decision
their
elephant
turned
and
seized
him
as
he
took
aim
flinging
him
down
and
crushing
him
under
its
foot
with
a
single
motion
at
once
the
imperial
infantry
again
started
to
clear
a
path
in
front
of
them
jesus
i
see
why
elephants
are
so
feared
on
a
battlefield
yes
but
they
can
not
fight
the
entire
battle
shirin
voice
trailed
off
as
she
stared
through
a
hole
in
the
side
of
the
suddenly
her
eyes
flooded
with
fear
oh
allah
merciful
allah
look
a
formation
of
imperial
horsemen
perhaps
fifty
in
number
was
advancing
toward
them
from
the
eastern
perimeter
of
the
plain
they
wore
body
armor
of
black
steel
and
they
ignored
the
infantry
battling
around
them
as
they
charged
directly
for
the
circle
of
elephants
who
are
they
i
think
they
latifs
special
bundella
guards
i
only
heard
about
them
his
elephant
must
be
near
and
he
ordered
them
to
attack
he
must
realize
the
prince
is
vulnerable
now
he
hopes
to
kill
prince
jadar
in
a
quick
action
and
so
end
the
battle
she
stared
over
the
side
of
the
steel
if
they
fail
then
he
will
send
his
regular
rajput
cavalry
what
so
special
about
bundellas
they
from
the
region
of
bundelkhand
and
their
horses
are
said
to
be
specially
trained
against
elephants
the
native
bundellas
she
ducked
down
and
stared
wildly
around
the
howdah
as
an
arrow
grazed
by
where
the
matchlocks
hawksworth
quickly
pulled
up
one
of
the
muskets
and
checked
the
prime
he
passed
it
to
shirin
and
took
a
second
for
himself
as
he
looked
again
over
the
top
of
the
he
saw
the
elephants
guarding
jadar
start
turning
to
face
the
approaching
horsemen
their
own
elephant
had
now
reached
the
defense
lines
and
it
immediately
assumed
its
normal
place
in
the
protective
circle
many
of
the
approaching
bundellas
were
already
being
cut
down
by
the
spears
of
the
rajput
infantry
but
over
half
managed
to
penetrate
the
outer
defense
perimeter
and
reach
the
circle
of
elephants
the
horsemen
immediately
began
firing
rockets
into
jadar
elephants
from
long
bamboo
tubes
they
carried
intending
to
frighten
them
and
disrupt
their
ranks
as
hawksworth
watched
three
of
jadar
encircling
war
elephants
shied
skittishly
away
from
the
fireworks
creating
a
momentary
opening
in
the
line
before
the
opening
could
be
secured
two
of
the
bundella
cavalry
dashed
through
the
space
once
inside
the
defense
perimeter
they
parted
one
riding
toward
either
side
of
jadar
elephant
one
of
the
horsemen
took
careful
aim
with
his
bow
and
shot
a
barbed
arrow
connected
to
a
line
deep
into
the
armor
of
the
mahout
seated
on
the
neck
of
jadar
elephant
the
horseman
quickly
whipped
the
arrow
line
around
his
saddle
horn
and
reined
his
mount
the
horse
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
was
expected
as
it
instantly
reared
backward
unseating
jadar
mahout
and
toppling
him
into
the
dust
as
the
mahout
fell
his
steel
against
jadar
momentarily
distracting
the
prince
when
he
whirled
to
look
for
his
mahout
the
other
bundella
spurred
his
stallion
alongside
the
elephant
rump
lifting
a
heavy
spear
above
his
head
but
instead
of
hurtling
the
spear
toward
jadar
he
turned
and
plunged
it
deep
into
the
ground
beside
the
elephant
shirin
what
he
doing
how
can
the
horseman
twirled
his
long
reins
around
the
shaft
in
a
quick
motion
tethering
the
horse
then
he
balanced
himself
atop
the
saddle
unsheathed
his
sword
and
with
an
agile
leap
landed
on
the
armored
rump
of
jadar
elephant
he
secured
his
balance
in
less
than
a
second
then
grabbed
the
side
of
jadar
gilded
hawksworth
stared
spellbound
as
a
rain
of
rajput
arrows
glanced
harmlessly
off
his
black
steel
body
armor
now
shirin
voice
was
almost
a
scream
as
though
in
a
dream
hawksworth
leveled
the
long
barrel
of
his
matchlock
against
the
rim
of
the
took
aim
the
stock
felt
alien
and
bulky
in
his
grip
and
its
lacquer
inlay
smooth
and
cold
he
saw
shirin
thrust
her
own
musket
alongside
his
own
struggling
to
keep
its
heavy
barrel
balanced
as
the
horseman
raised
his
sword
to
plunge
it
into
jadar
exposed
back
hawksworth
squeezed
the
gun
inlaid
trigger
the
stock
kicked
into
his
face
and
a
burst
of
black
smoke
momentarily
blinded
him
shirin
matchlock
had
discharged
at
the
same
moment
and
he
looked
down
as
she
tumbled
backward
against
the
padded
side
of
the
howdah
still
grasping
the
gun
heavy
stock
then
he
heard
a
cheer
from
the
rajputs
and
turned
in
time
to
see
the
bundella
spin
in
a
half
circle
hawksworth
realized
one
musket
ball
had
caught
him
directly
in
the
face
the
other
in
the
groin
he
vainly
reached
to
seize
the
side
of
jadar
regain
his
balance
but
his
foot
skidded
and
he
slipped
backward
into
a
forest
of
rajput
spears
the
flash
of
a
sword
took
his
head
jadar
had
never
seen
him
that
settles
one
debt
you
cocky
bastard
there
were
shouts
from
the
other
attackers
still
outside
the
defense
perimeter
and
two
horsemen
reined
their
mounts
and
charged
toward
hawksworth
and
shirin
as
they
approached
the
elephant
began
revolving
to
meet
them
hawksworth
reached
down
and
grabbed
the
last
remaining
musket
and
rose
to
fire
as
he
looked
up
he
stopped
in
astonishment
for
a
second
refusing
to
believe
what
he
saw
both
bundelkhand
horses
were
advancing
on
their
hind
legs
rearing
and
bounding
toward
them
in
high
leaps
he
watched
transfixed
as
one
of
the
bundellas
discharged
his
bow
past
the
neck
of
his
horse
directly
at
the
the
arrow
missed
shirin
hair
by
only
inches
hawksworth
lifted
his
matchlock
and
leveled
it
against
the
rim
wondering
for
an
instant
whether
to
aim
for
the
man
or
the
horse
then
the
matchlock
blazed
and
he
watched
the
horseman
buckle
backward
in
the
saddle
toppling
into
a
circle
of
waiting
rajput
swords
suddenly
the
howdah
shuddered
throwing
him
sprawling
against
the
side
as
he
pulled
himself
up
he
realized
the
other
horse
had
secured
its
front
feet
against
the
side
of
their
elephant
the
bundella
was
staring
directly
in
his
face
pulling
an
arrow
from
his
saddle
quiver
the
horseman
bow
was
already
half
drawn
when
hawksworth
heard
the
sing
of
a
bowstring
beside
him
as
he
watched
the
end
of
a
shaft
suddenly
appeared
in
the
right
cheek
of
the
bundella
buried
to
the
feathers
the
horseman
own
arrow
slammed
into
the
side
of
the
and
he
reached
to
claw
at
his
face
with
his
saddle
hand
forfeiting
his
grip
as
he
slipped
backward
off
the
rearing
horse
the
rajput
infantrymen
beheaded
him
in
midair
hawksworth
turned
to
see
shirin
drop
her
bow
onto
the
floor
of
the
she
slumped
against
the
steel
side
her
eyes
glazed
with
incredulity
at
what
she
had
done
they
watched
wordlessly
as
the
perimeter
of
jadar
elephants
was
again
drawn
together
and
secured
as
the
other
horsemen
were
driven
back
a
coherent
defense
barricade
of
concentric
circles
was
gradually
established
around
the
prince
the
outer
perimeter
was
a
line
of
rajput
infantry
armed
with
long
spears
inside
their
line
were
rajput
swordsmen
who
now
had
linked
together
the
skirts
of
their
long
mesh
cloaks
to
form
a
solid
barrier
and
inside
these
was
the
last
defense
line
the
circle
of
armored
war
elephants
as
their
own
elephant
instinctively
rejoined
the
line
protecting
jadar
hawksworth
reached
to
touch
shirin
hand
as
he
did
he
noticed
her
thumb
was
bleeding
and
realized
for
the
first
time
she
had
not
been
supplied
a
bow
ring
i
think
we
can
hold
off
the
infantry
with
the
elephants
but
i
know
how
long
her
voice
trailed
off
as
he
looked
up
at
her
face
she
was
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
pointing
wordlessly
toward
the
east
he
turned
to
see
a
vast
wave
of
the
imperial
rajput
horsemen
bearing
down
on
their
position
they
numbered
in
the
thousands
god
almighty
he
reached
weakly
for
another
arrow
trying
to
count
those
remaining
in
the
quiver
and
asking
if
he
would
live
long
enough
to
shoot
them
all
it
over
their
battle
cry
lifted
above
the
plain
as
the
approaching
cavalry
neared
the
edge
of
the
massed
imperial
infantry
engulfing
jadar
they
began
advancing
directly
through
the
infantry
not
slowing
heading
straight
for
jadar
hawksworth
notched
an
arrow
and
rose
up
in
the
to
take
aim
he
drew
back
the
string
and
picked
the
man
in
the
lead
for
the
first
arrow
as
he
sighted
the
rajput
bearded
face
down
the
shaft
he
suddenly
froze
the
rajput
had
just
driven
the
long
point
of
his
spear
into
an
imperial
infantryman
hawksworth
lowered
his
bow
in
disbelief
and
stared
as
the
approaching
imperial
cavalry
began
cutting
down
their
own
infantry
taking
heads
as
they
rode
toward
jadar
leaving
a
carpet
of
death
in
their
bloody
wake
holy
jesus
what
happening
they
attacking
their
own
troops
are
they
sotted
with
opium
too
suddenly
their
chant
of
ram
ram
was
taken
up
by
the
rajputs
surrounding
jadar
and
they
turned
on
the
imperial
infantry
nearest
them
with
the
ferocity
of
a
wounded
tiger
today
allah
took
on
the
armor
of
a
rajput
shirin
slumped
against
the
side
of
the
howdah
and
dropped
her
bow
i
had
prayed
they
would
all
one
day
join
with
the
prince
but
i
never
really
believed
it
would
happen
jadar
circle
of
war
elephants
began
to
cut
their
way
through
the
remaining
infantry
to
join
the
rajput
forces
swivel
guns
blazing
from
their
backs
in
what
seemed
only
minutes
his
entourage
merged
with
the
vanguard
of
rajput
cavalry
and
together
they
moved
like
a
steel
phalanx
against
the
imperial
infantry
reserves
waiting
in
the
east
hawksworth
watched
as
the
imperial
lines
were
cut
separating
the
infantry
fighting
on
the
plain
from
their
reserves
next
a
corps
of
rajput
horsemen
wielding
long
spears
overran
the
imperial
gun
emplacements
then
grouped
to
assault
the
imperial
command
post
when
the
elephant
bearing
the
banner
of
inayat
latif
started
for
higher
ground
discipline
in
the
imperial
ranks
evaporated
by
late
afternoon
the
outcome
was
no
longer
in
question
a
final
attempt
by
the
imperial
forces
to
regroup
disintegrated
into
a
rout
with
thousands
of
fleeing
imperial
infantry
falling
before
the
swords
and
spears
of
the
rajput
cavalry
only
the
merciful
descent
of
dark
enabled
inayat
latif
and
his
imperial
commanders
to
escape
death
at
the
hands
of
pursuing
rajput
archers
as
hawksworth
rode
with
jadar
entourage
through
the
dusty
shrouded
battlefield
headed
back
for
the
camp
he
felt
he
was
witnessing
the
gaping
mouth
of
hell
the
plain
was
littered
with
the
bodies
of
almost
forty
thousand
men
and
over
ten
thousand
horses
the
proud
war
cries
were
forgotten
through
the
dusky
twilight
came
the
plaintive
moans
of
dying
men
and
the
shrill
neighing
of
shattered
horses
rajputs
moved
among
the
bodies
plundering
the
dead
enemy
searching
for
fallen
comrades
dispatching
with
their
long
swords
any
lingering
men
or
horses
who
could
not
be
saved
all
because
of
jadar
hawksworth
thought
and
his
stomach
sickened
now
what
will
happen
jadar
won
the
day
in
this
valley
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
but
the
moghul
is
still
in
agra
and
tonight
he
still
rules
india
and
i
think
he
still
rule
india
if
only
in
name
till
the
day
he
dies
jadar
ca
march
against
the
red
fort
in
agra
not
with
this
ragtag
army
even
his
division
of
rajput
defectors
could
storm
that
fortress
i
not
sure
god
himself
could
take
the
red
fort
so
what
now
noble
prince
jadar
so
far
you
merely
brought
death
to
half
the
fighting
men
in
india
the
torchbearers
marching
four
abreast
at
the
front
of
their
elephants
were
now
approaching
the
remains
of
the
camp
through
the
flickering
light
emerged
the
vision
of
a
ruin
scorched
furrows
from
the
first
imperial
cannonade
trailed
between
among
through
the
few
remaining
tents
small
clusters
of
wounded
men
some
begging
for
water
and
some
for
death
were
being
fed
opium
and
their
wounds
wrapped
with
the
shreds
of
tents
jadar
moved
through
the
camp
acknowledging
the
triumphant
cheers
of
his
men
ahead
his
servants
were
already
erecting
a
new
chintz
wall
around
the
bar
replacing
the
tents
for
the
hawksworth
watched
as
carpets
were
unrolled
from
bullock
carts
and
carried
inside
the
compound
jadar
elephant
proceeded
instinctively
to
the
very
entry
of
the
where
it
kneeled
for
him
to
dismount
around
him
rajputs
pushed
forward
to
cheer
and
as
he
stood
acknowledging
them
the
other
elephants
also
began
to
kneel
jadar
servants
rushed
forward
to
help
hawksworth
and
shirin
alight
this
was
the
most
horrible
day
i
ever
known
her
arms
closed
around
his
neck
as
her
feet
touched
ground
and
she
held
him
for
a
long
moment
tears
staining
her
cheeks
i
never
before
seen
so
much
killing
i
pray
to
allah
i
never
see
it
again
hawksworth
returned
her
embrace
then
looked
at
her
sadly
there
be
a
lot
more
before
jadar
sees
agra
if
he
ever
does
this
is
just
one
battle
not
the
war
i
not
sure
we
want
to
be
here
to
find
out
how
it
ends
she
looked
back
at
him
and
smiled
wistfully
in
silence
then
she
turned
and
performed
the
jadar
the
prince
was
scarcely
recognizable
his
helmet
had
been
torn
by
countless
arrows
or
matchlock
fire
and
his
haughty
face
and
beard
were
smeared
with
dust
and
smoke
the
emerald
bow
ring
was
missing
from
his
right
thumb
which
was
now
caked
with
blood
beneath
his
armor
the
torn
leather
of
his
right
sleeve
was
stained
where
he
had
ripped
out
an
arrow
as
he
lifted
his
arms
to
acknowledge
the
rising
cheers
his
eyes
were
shadowed
and
tired
but
they
betrayed
no
pain
hawksworth
turned
and
examined
jadar
it
was
a
forest
of
arrows
and
broken
spear
shafts
grooms
from
the
stables
had
already
brought
water
and
sugarcane
for
his
elephant
and
begun
extracting
iron
arrowheads
from
its
legs
and
from
a
section
of
its
right
shoulder
where
its
armor
had
been
shot
away
as
he
watched
the
scene
hawksworth
slowly
became
aware
of
a
pathway
being
cleared
through
the
camp
toward
the
east
next
the
cheers
of
some
of
jadar
rajputs
began
to
swell
through
the
smoky
air
through
the
encroaching
dark
there
slowly
emerged
the
form
of
another
elephant
approaching
in
the
torchlight
he
could
tell
it
was
regal
in
size
and
bore
a
gilded
by
a
wide
brocade
umbrella
there
were
no
arrows
in
the
side
of
this
nor
was
there
more
than
a
trace
of
dust
on
the
elephant
gilded
and
enameled
armor
with
its
elaborate
decoration
of
swinging
yak
tails
and
tinkling
bells
it
seemed
more
suited
for
a
royal
procession
than
for
a
battlefield
jadar
watched
impassively
as
the
elephant
neared
the
center
of
the
clearing
while
the
rajputs
around
him
stood
at
attention
the
elephant
performed
a
small
bow
then
began
to
kneel
with
practiced
dignity
several
rajputs
rushed
forward
to
help
the
rider
alight
the
man
jeweled
turban
and
rows
of
finger
rings
sparkled
in
the
torchlight
as
he
moved
directly
toward
jadar
hawksworth
suddenly
recognized
the
walk
and
caught
his
breath
it
was
nadir
sharif
the
prime
minister
paused
a
few
feet
from
jadar
and
salaamed
lightly
he
did
not
nor
did
he
speak
as
he
stood
waiting
from
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
bar
figure
of
a
woman
emerged
she
was
veiled
surrounded
by
her
women
and
accompanied
by
a
line
of
eunuchs
wearing
sheathed
scimitars
in
their
waist
sash
she
stopped
and
performed
the
jadar
then
she
turned
to
nadir
sharif
he
stared
at
her
for
a
long
moment
then
said
something
in
persian
without
a
word
she
lifted
her
veil
and
threw
it
back
next
she
turned
and
gestured
to
one
of
the
servants
standing
behind
her
the
servant
stepped
forward
with
a
bundle
wrapped
in
a
brocade
satin
blanket
and
carried
it
directly
to
nadir
sharif
the
prime
minister
stood
for
a
moment
as
though
unsure
whether
to
take
it
finally
he
reached
out
and
lifted
the
blanket
from
the
servant
and
cradled
it
against
one
arm
he
stared
down
for
a
long
moment
his
eyes
seeming
to
cloud
and
then
he
pushed
back
part
of
the
blanket
to
examine
its
contents
more
closely
with
a
withered
finger
he
reached
in
and
stroked
something
inside
the
blanket
then
he
looked
up
and
smiled
and
said
something
to
jadar
in
persian
the
prince
laughed
and
strolled
to
his
side
taking
the
blanket
in
his
own
hands
and
peering
down
into
it
with
nadir
sharif
they
exchanged
more
words
in
persian
laughed
again
and
then
nadir
sharif
walked
to
the
waiting
woman
whose
dark
eyes
now
brimmed
with
joy
he
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
long
moment
then
spoke
to
her
in
persian
and
enfolded
her
in
his
arms
a
cheer
went
up
again
from
the
onlookers
as
they
pushed
forward
to
watch
hawksworth
turned
to
shirin
is
that
who
i
think
it
is
shirin
nodded
her
eyes
misting
it
mumtaz
the
first
wife
of
prince
jadar
and
the
only
daughter
of
nadir
sharif
he
told
prince
jadar
he
decided
today
he
wanted
to
see
his
grandson
since
he
wanted
to
see
the
face
of
the
child
who
would
be
moghul
himself
one
day
then
he
told
mumtaz
he
will
die
in
peace
now
knowing
that
his
blood
will
someday
flow
in
the
veins
of
the
moghul
of
india
shirin
voice
started
to
choke
i
ca
tell
you
what
this
moment
means
it
the
beginning
of
just
rule
for
india
nadir
sharif
knew
that
if
prince
jadar
was
defeated
today
the
child
would
be
murdered
by
janahara
by
defecting
with
his
rajputs
he
saved
prince
jadar
and
he
saved
his
grandson
she
paused
again
and
he
saved
us
too
when
do
you
think
he
decided
to
do
this
i
do
know
i
still
ca
believe
it
true
hawksworth
stopped
for
a
moment
then
whirled
and
seized
her
arm
jadar
knew
by
jesus
he
knew
last
night
the
cavalry
he
said
the
cavalry
had
to
be
held
to
the
last
he
knew
they
would
turn
on
the
imperial
infantry
if
he
began
to
he
knew
all
shirin
examined
him
with
a
curious
expression
i
wonder
if
mumtaz
herself
planned
it
perhaps
she
convinced
nadir
sharif
to
save
his
grandson
she
paused
this
must
have
been
the
most
closely
guarded
secret
in
all
of
agra
nadir
sharif
somehow
kept
even
the
queen
from
knowing
he
would
defect
with
the
rajputs
or
she
would
have
surely
killed
him
shirin
voice
trailed
off
as
she
pondered
the
implications
he
astonishing
janahara
has
never
entirely
trusted
him
but
somehow
he
must
have
convinced
her
to
let
him
command
the
rajput
cavalry
what
did
he
do
to
make
her
finally
trust
him
nadir
sharif
embraced
mumtaz
once
more
then
bowed
lightly
again
to
jadar
and
turned
to
leave
as
his
glance
swept
the
torchlit
crowd
he
noticed
hawksworth
he
stopped
for
a
second
as
though
not
believing
what
he
saw
then
broke
into
a
wide
smile
by
the
beard
of
the
prophet
can
it
be
my
old
guest
he
moved
toward
hawksworth
seeming
not
to
notice
shirin
may
allah
preserve
you
ambassador
everyone
at
court
thinks
you
fled
india
for
your
sake
i
almost
wish
you
had
what
in
god
name
are
you
doing
here
someone
tried
to
murder
me
at
fatehpur
hawksworth
turned
and
took
shirin
arm
and
shirin
it
seemed
like
a
good
time
to
switch
sides
someone
actually
tried
to
kill
you
i
do
hope
you
jesting
with
me
not
at
all
if
vasant
rao
and
his
men
had
appeared
in
time
to
help
us
we
both
be
dead
now
nadir
sharifs
eyes
darkened
and
he
looked
away
for
a
moment
i
must
tell
you
that
shocks
even
me
he
turned
back
and
smiled
but
pleased
to
see
you
still
very
much
alive
hawksworth
studied
nadir
sharif
for
a
moment
do
you
have
any
idea
who
might
have
ordered
it
this
world
of
ours
is
fraught
with
evil
ambassador
nadir
sharif
shook
his
head
in
resignation
i
sometimes
marvel
any
of
us
survive
it
then
he
looked
back
at
hawksworth
and
beamed
but
then
always
found
you
to
be
a
man
blessed
with
rare
fortune
ambassador
i
think
allah
must
truly
stand
watch
over
you
night
and
day
you
seem
to
live
on
coincidences
i
was
always
amazed
that
just
when
his
majesty
ordered
you
out
of
agra
the
portuguese
decided
to
seize
one
of
his
majesty
personal
cargo
vessels
and
by
that
imprudent
folly
restored
you
to
favor
now
i
hear
you
were
attacked
in
the
fatehpur
camp
by
some
scurrilous
hirelings
at
the
very
moment
the
prince
rajputs
just
happened
to
be
nearby
to
protect
you
i
only
wish
i
enjoyed
a
small
portion
of
your
luck
he
smiled
but
what
will
you
be
doing
now
will
you
be
joining
with
us
or
will
you
stay
with
the
prince
what
do
you
mean
i
understand
his
highness
is
striking
camp
tomorrow
and
marching
west
for
the
rajput
city
of
udaipur
the
new
a
distinguished
if
somewhat
renegade
rajput
prince
named
karan
singh
apparently
has
offered
his
lake
palace
as
a
refuge
for
the
prince
i
do
seem
to
have
much
choice
i
probably
no
more
welcome
in
agra
right
now
than
you
are
nadir
sharif
examined
him
quizzically
for
a
moment
i
not
sure
i
understand
exactly
what
you
mean
then
he
broke
into
laughter
ambassador
surely
you
do
assume
i
had
anything
to
do
with
the
tragedy
today
the
honest
truth
is
i
used
every
means
at
my
command
to
dissuade
the
rajput
cavalry
from
their
insidious
treachery
they
absolutely
refused
to
heed
anything
i
said
in
fact
i
actually
tried
to
forewarn
her
majesty
something
just
like
this
might
happen
what
are
you
talking
about
their
betrayal
was
astonishing
and
i
must
tell
you
frankly
entirely
unaccountable
i
intend
to
prepare
a
complete
report
for
her
majesty
but
this
is
merely
a
temporary
setback
for
us
never
fear
he
turned
and
bowed
lightly
to
shirin
acknowledging
her
for
the
first
time
i
really
must
be
leaving
for
the
imperial
camp
now
we
scheduled
a
war
council
tonight
to
plan
our
next
strategy
he
smiled
i
feel
i
should
counsel
you
once
again
that
you
chosen
very
unsavory
company
prince
jadar
is
a
thorough
disgrace
to
the
empire
he
bowed
lightly
once
more
to
hawksworth
then
to
shirin
and
turned
to
remount
his
elephant
good
night
ambassador
perhaps
someday
soon
we
drink
again
in
agra
even
as
he
spoke
his
elephant
rose
and
began
to
move
out
his
last
words
were
drowned
by
cheering
rajputs
he
never
get
away
with
it
hawksworth
watched
incredulously
as
the
elephant
began
delicately
picking
its
way
through
the
shattered
camp
oh
yes
he
will
you
do
know
nadir
sharif
as
i
do
hawksworth
turned
to
stare
in
bewilderment
at
jadar
the
prince
was
standing
next
to
mumtaz
their
faces
expressionless
as
nadir
elephant
disappeared
into
the
dark
mumtaz
said
something
in
persian
and
gestured
toward
shirin
she
replied
in
the
same
language
and
they
moved
together
embracing
your
face
is
still
fresh
as
the
dawn
though
your
the
dust
of
war
mumtaz
persian
was
delicate
and
laced
with
poetic
allusions
she
kissed
shirin
then
looked
down
and
noticed
her
right
hand
and
what
happened
to
your
thumb
i
had
no
bow
ring
you
know
we
are
supposed
to
shoot
or
do
anything
else
except
bear
sons
mumtaz
flashed
a
mock
frown
in
the
direction
of
jadar
if
i
would
let
him
his
highness
would
treat
me
like
some
stupid
arab
wet
nurse
instead
of
a
persian
she
embraced
shirin
again
and
kissed
her
once
more
i
also
know
you
learned
to
fire
a
matchlock
today
how
did
you
find
out
some
of
the
rajputs
saw
you
shoot
a
bundella
horseman
who
had
breached
their
lines
and
reached
his
highness
elephant
one
of
them
told
my
eunuchs
her
voice
dropped
he
said
you
saved
his
highness
life
i
want
to
thank
you
it
was
my
duty
no
it
was
your
love
i
sorry
i
dare
not
tell
his
highness
what
you
did
he
must
never
find
out
he
already
worried
about
too
many
obligations
you
saw
what
just
happened
tonight
with
father
i
think
he
very
troubled
about
what
price
he
may
be
asked
to
pay
someday
for
what
happened
today
i
must
tell
you
the
english
shot
the
bundella
who
had
mounted
his
highness
elephant
is
he
the
one
there
mumtaz
nodded
discreetly
toward
hawksworth
who
stood
uncomprehending
his
haggard
face
and
jerkin
smeared
with
smoke
her
voice
had
risen
slightly
and
now
her
persian
was
lilting
again
he
the
one
mumtaz
scrutinized
hawksworth
with
a
quick
flick
of
her
eyes
never
looking
up
he
interesting
truly
as
striking
as
i
heard
i
love
him
more
than
my
life
i
wish
you
could
know
him
persian
was
equally
as
genteel
as
that
of
mumtaz
but
is
he
yet
a
worthy
lover
in
your
bed
mumtaz
smile
was
almost
hidden
i
sent
your
message
to
father
about
the
hindu
shirin
smiled
and
said
nothing
then
you
must
bring
him
with
us
to
udaipur
if
his
highness
will
have
us
there
will
have
you
there
she
laughed
and
looked
again
at
hawksworth
if
you
tell
me
sometime
what
it
like
to
share
your
pillow
with
a
captain
hawksworth
jadar
martial
voice
rose
above
the
assembled
crowd
of
congratulating
rajputs
did
i
notice
you
on
the
field
today
i
thought
i
had
assigned
you
to
guard
my
are
you
aware
the
punishment
for
disobeying
orders
in
an
army
in
india
is
immediate
beheading
of
if
you
like
i
can
have
you
shot
from
a
cannon
as
is
sometimes
done
which
would
you
prefer
your
cannon
were
mostly
overrun
i
guess
you
have
to
behead
me
if
you
can
find
anyone
left
with
a
sword
sharp
enough
jadar
roared
and
pulled
out
his
own
sword
there
was
a
deep
nick
in
the
blade
by
tomorrow
i
sure
we
can
find
one
in
the
meantime
i
have
to
confine
you
in
the
bar
prevent
your
escape
he
slipped
the
sword
back
into
his
belt
tell
me
did
you
manage
to
hit
anything
today
with
your
matchlocks
possibly
there
were
so
many
in
the
imperial
infantry
i
may
have
succeeded
in
hitting
someone
jadar
laughed
again
from
the
looks
of
her
thumb
it
would
seem
the
woman
in
your
most
of
the
shooting
i
astounded
permit
her
such
liberty
she
has
a
mind
of
her
own
like
all
persians
jadar
reached
and
lowered
mumtaz
veil
over
her
face
she
let
it
hang
for
a
moment
then
shoved
it
back
again
allah
protect
us
he
turned
and
stared
a
moment
into
the
dark
toward
the
direction
nadir
sharif
had
departed
yes
allah
protect
us
from
all
persians
and
from
all
persian
ambition
then
he
suddenly
remembered
himself
and
glanced
back
at
hawksworth
so
tonight
we
may
eat
lamb
together
after
all
if
there
one
still
to
be
found
but
not
yet
in
paradise
for
that
you
will
have
to
wait
a
few
days
longer
hawksworth
shifted
uncomfortably
what
exactly
do
you
mean
udaipur
captain
tomorrow
we
strike
camp
and
march
for
udaipur
a
rajput
paradise
he
turned
and
beckoned
toward
the
rajput
commander
who
had
ridden
from
fatehpur
with
them
it
time
you
met
my
friend
mahdu
singh
brother
of
his
highness
rana
karan
singh
the
maharana
of
udaipur
the
generously
offered
us
his
new
guest
palace
on
his
island
of
jagmandir
it
on
pichola
lake
in
the
rajput
capital
of
udaipur
he
was
only
just
building
the
palace
when
i
was
there
before
but
i
seem
to
remember
it
designed
in
a
very
interesting
new
style
he
glanced
at
mumtaz
i
think
her
highness
will
approve
then
he
continued
rajputana
captain
is
beautiful
what
more
its
mountains
are
impregnable
i
led
the
only
moghul
army
ever
to
escape
defeat
by
the
rajputs
who
live
in
those
mountains
but
today
i
have
many
loyal
friends
there
mahdu
singh
bowed
lightly
to
hawksworth
while
jadar
watched
in
satisfaction
his
highness
the
maharana
may
decide
to
make
a
rajput
out
of
you
and
keep
you
there
if
you
seem
worth
the
trouble
who
can
tell
he
turned
and
dismissed
mumtaz
and
her
eunuchs
with
a
wave
he
watched
fondly
as
she
disappeared
into
the
then
turned
and
joined
the
waiting
rajputs
together
they
moved
out
through
the
camp
embracing
and
consoling
did
you
hear
what
he
said
hawksworth
turned
to
shirin
who
stood
waiting
a
light
smile
erasing
some
of
the
fatigue
in
her
face
planning
to
recruit
another
army
of
rajputs
this
war
is
only
beginning
good
christ
when
will
it
end
when
he
moghul
nothing
will
stop
him
now
she
took
his
hand
and
together
they
pushed
through
the
shattered
gulal
bar
toward
the
remains
of
their
tent
chapter
the
advance
of
prince
jadar
army
west
toward
the
rajput
stronghold
of
udaipur
was
like
nothing
brian
hawksworth
had
ever
seen
jadar
was
marching
into
the
heart
of
ancient
rajput
country
and
the
movement
of
his
army
suddenly
came
to
resemble
a
triumphant
victory
procession
the
heavy
artillery
formed
the
first
contingent
drawn
by
teams
of
elephants
and
bullocks
two
thousand
infantry
moved
in
front
smoothing
the
ground
with
spades
the
army
baggage
animals
followed
the
artillery
and
after
this
came
jadar
personal
treasury
camels
loaded
with
gold
and
silver
coin
together
with
his
records
and
archives
next
in
the
line
of
march
were
elephants
carrying
the
jewels
and
a
collection
of
ornate
swords
and
daggers
that
jadar
periodically
gave
to
his
officers
as
presents
then
came
the
water
camels
and
finally
jadar
kitchen
and
provisions
the
baggage
was
followed
by
the
ordinary
cavalry
and
after
them
rode
jadar
and
his
retinue
of
nobles
behind
him
came
his
the
rear
of
the
procession
was
brought
up
by
women
and
servants
then
elephants
camels
and
mules
carrying
the
remainder
of
the
baggage
and
tents
some
of
jadar
traveled
in
gilded
on
the
shoulders
of
four
bearers
and
shaded
with
netting
of
colored
embroidered
silk
others
were
transported
in
enclosed
palanquins
also
covered
with
silk
nets
decorated
with
gold
fringe
and
tassels
still
others
chose
to
ride
in
swaying
litters
suspended
between
two
elephants
or
two
strong
camels
a
female
slave
walked
near
each
litter
carrying
a
peacock
tail
to
brush
off
dust
and
keep
away
flies
jadar
first
and
favorite
wife
mumtaz
seemed
to
scorn
all
these
comforts
displaying
herself
regally
all
day
long
from
atop
her
own
personal
elephant
riding
in
a
gold
by
a
vast
tapestry
umbrella
her
elephant
was
festooned
with
embroideries
yak
tails
and
large
silver
bells
and
directly
behind
her
on
six
smaller
elephants
rode
the
women
of
her
immediate
household
her
eunuchs
rode
clustered
around
her
on
horses
each
carrying
a
wand
signifying
his
office
and
sweating
profusely
beneath
his
jeweled
turban
a
vanguard
of
footmen
with
bamboo
canes
walked
ahead
of
mumtaz
elephant
clearing
a
path
through
the
crowds
jadar
himself
traveled
mainly
on
his
favorite
arabian
horse
except
when
passing
through
cities
when
he
would
switch
to
a
conspicuously
bedecked
elephant
surrounded
by
the
nobles
trailing
out
behind
this
first
circle
were
the
ranks
of
the
lesser
who
rode
in
full
military
dress
displaying
swords
bows
shields
while
this
procession
inched
along
at
its
regal
pace
jadar
and
his
nobles
frequently
paused
ostentatiously
to
bag
tiger
or
chase
antelope
with
the
prince
brace
of
hunting
a
complete
set
of
tents
for
jadar
and
his
a
day
ahead
to
ensure
that
a
fully
prepared
camp
always
awaited
him
and
his
women
when
at
approximately
three
in
the
afternoon
the
procession
would
stop
and
begin
to
settle
for
the
night
each
of
his
larger
tents
could
be
disassembled
into
three
separate
sections
and
all
of
these
together
required
a
full
fifty
baggage
elephants
for
transport
moving
the
smaller
tents
required
almost
a
hundred
camels
wardrobes
and
kitchen
utensils
were
carried
by
some
fifty
mules
and
special
porters
carried
by
hand
jadar
personal
porcelains
his
gilt
beds
and
a
few
of
his
silk
tents
the
procession
was
a
lavish
display
of
all
the
wealth
and
arms
jadar
had
remaining
and
nothing
about
it
hinted
that
his
was
an
army
on
the
run
which
in
fact
it
was
hawksworth
puzzled
over
jadar
extravagant
pomp
for
several
days
finding
it
uncharacteristic
and
finally
concluded
it
was
a
deliberate
indian
strategy
jadar
has
to
raise
another
army
and
quickly
he
not
do
it
if
he
has
the
look
of
a
fugitive
and
loser
about
him
he
managed
to
hold
the
imperial
army
at
bay
for
a
while
wound
them
enough
to
escape
entrapment
but
he
wounded
too
and
badly
the
imperial
army
may
be
shattered
for
the
moment
but
jadar
lost
half
his
own
men
the
winner
will
be
the
one
who
can
rebuild
first
and
attack
if
jadar
does
make
some
alliances
and
get
some
men
soon
inayat
latif
and
the
queen
will
chase
him
from
one
end
of
india
to
the
other
along
the
way
a
few
independent
rajput
chieftains
had
come
to
his
banner
but
not
enough
when
hawksworth
asked
shirin
what
she
thought
jadar
chances
were
of
raising
a
rajput
army
large
enough
to
face
inayat
latif
she
had
made
no
effort
to
conceal
her
concern
the
greatest
rajput
nobles
are
waiting
to
see
whether
maharana
karan
singh
of
udaipur
will
decide
to
openly
support
him
he
the
leader
of
the
ranas
of
mewar
which
is
the
name
for
the
lands
of
rajputana
around
udaipur
and
they
the
highest
in
rank
of
all
the
rajput
chieftains
of
india
if
maharana
karan
singh
agrees
to
support
him
with
his
own
army
the
other
ranas
of
mewar
may
follow
and
after
them
perhaps
all
of
rajputana
what
do
you
mean
he
providing
jadar
a
place
to
stay
or
at
least
to
hide
while
he
licks
his
wounds
that
looks
like
support
to
me
shirin
had
tried
to
smile
permitting
prince
jadar
to
camp
in
udaipur
does
necessarily
imply
support
it
could
also
be
interpreted
merely
as
traditional
rajput
hospitality
it
one
thing
to
open
your
guesthouse
to
a
son
of
the
moghul
it
something
quite
different
to
commit
your
army
to
aid
his
rebellion
she
drew
her
horse
closer
to
hawksworth
you
see
maharana
karan
singh
and
his
father
amar
singh
before
him
have
had
a
treaty
of
peace
with
arangbar
for
almost
ten
years
after
many
decades
of
bloody
war
between
mewar
and
the
moghuls
there
are
many
rajput
chieftains
in
mewar
who
do
not
want
him
to
renounce
that
treaty
they
weary
of
moghul
armies
invading
rajputana
and
burning
their
fields
and
cities
prince
jadar
will
have
to
negotiate
with
maharana
karan
singh
if
he
to
be
persuaded
to
help
the
prince
will
have
to
offer
him
something
in
return
for
his
aid
for
the
risk
he
be
taking
should
the
prince
lose
that
why
the
other
rajputs
are
waiting
everyone
here
knows
the
prince
has
no
chance
if
the
maharana
withholds
his
support
a
noticeable
feeling
of
relief
swept
through
the
long
columns
of
jadar
cavalry
the
afternoon
that
maharana
karan
singh
was
sighted
riding
out
on
his
elephant
surrounded
by
a
retinue
of
his
personal
guard
to
welcome
prince
jadar
at
the
high
stone
gate
leading
through
the
walls
of
the
mountain
city
of
udaipur
throughout
the
ranks
of
jadar
bedraggled
army
it
was
seen
as
a
positive
omen
the
army
and
the
lesser
outside
the
city
walls
the
nobles
were
invited
to
stay
in
the
maharana
city
palace
set
on
a
high
cliff
overlooking
pichola
lake
and
jadar
his
and
his
personal
guards
were
ferried
with
much
pomp
across
to
the
new
guest
palace
on
jagmandir
island
in
the
center
of
the
lake
as
one
of
arangbar
khans
and
a
foreign
ambassador
brian
hawksworth
was
installed
by
the
maharana
in
a
special
suite
in
his
city
palace
reserved
for
dignitaries
in
an
even
more
auspicious
gesture
the
maharana
invited
prince
jadar
to
dine
with
him
in
the
palace
that
evening
the
ancient
rajputana
tradition
of
hospitality
did
not
normally
require
dining
with
your
guests
and
the
rajput
chieftains
traveling
with
jadar
were
again
heartened
late
in
the
afternoon
an
invitation
also
arrived
requesting
that
ambassador
hawksworth
and
shirin
characterized
as
personal
aide
join
the
dinner
why
do
you
think
he
wants
us
when
the
maharana
servants
had
left
hawksworth
showed
the
gilded
invitation
to
shirin
she
was
on
their
balcony
watching
cranes
glide
across
the
surface
of
pichola
lake
spreading
out
hundreds
of
feet
below
them
perhaps
the
maharana
is
curious
to
meet
a
i
sure
never
seen
one
before
she
hesitated
or
perhaps
prince
jadar
arranged
for
you
to
be
there
to
imply
he
has
the
support
of
the
english
king
warships
you
know
i
do
speak
for
king
james
on
matters
of
war
tonight
you
must
appear
to
do
so
i
sure
your
king
would
help
prince
jadar
if
he
knew
him
he
support
him
if
he
becomes
moghul
then
you
must
help
prince
jadar
tonight
so
that
he
will
shirin
had
overseen
the
servants
who
had
been
sent
to
clean
and
repair
hawksworth
doublet
and
hose
then
a
bath
was
brought
accompanied
by
barbers
and
manicurists
the
maharana
sent
a
vial
of
musk
perfume
to
shirin
buried
in
a
basket
of
flowers
by
the
time
they
were
escorted
through
the
high
scalloped
archway
leading
into
the
palace
banquet
hall
they
both
were
bathed
perfumed
and
refreshed
and
hawksworth
again
looked
almost
like
an
ambassador
accustomed
to
the
red
sandstone
of
agra
he
was
momentarily
astounded
to
see
a
room
fashioned
entirely
from
purest
white
marble
the
hall
was
long
and
wide
with
two
rows
of
bracketed
columns
its
entire
length
maharana
karan
singh
sat
at
the
far
end
in
front
of
a
marble
screen
his
gold
wand
of
office
at
his
side
reclining
against
an
enormous
bolster
of
gold
brocade
he
appeared
to
be
jadar
age
with
eyes
that
sparkled
mischievously
a
long
rajput
moustache
glistening
with
wax
which
curled
upward
at
the
ends
and
a
turban
of
gold
brocade
he
wore
a
long
red
and
white
striped
satin
skirt
beneath
a
translucent
cloak
his
necklace
and
earrings
were
matching
green
emeralds
seated
around
him
on
red
carpets
woven
with
designs
of
fighting
elephants
were
his
rajput
nobles
each
in
white
with
an
orange
turban
and
a
brocade
sash
at
his
waist
every
rajput
in
the
room
had
a
katar
jadar
saw
hawksworth
and
shirin
enter
and
rose
to
greet
them
the
prince
was
dressed
in
his
finest
with
a
cloak
of
gold
cloth
pale
green
trousers
red
velvet
slippers
a
long
double
string
of
pearls
around
his
neck
and
a
pink
silk
turban
crisscrossed
with
flowered
brocade
and
secured
with
a
large
ruby
he
led
hawksworth
before
the
maharana
and
introduced
him
in
rajasthani
jadar
then
translated
the
introduction
into
turki
for
hawksworth
who
was
startled
to
learn
that
he
was
a
member
of
angrezi
english
royalty
he
looked
around
and
realized
he
was
easily
the
most
shabbily
attired
man
in
the
room
including
the
servants
after
the
introduction
hawksworth
took
his
place
among
jadar
own
retinue
of
nobles
shirin
was
seated
on
the
carpet
directly
behind
him
all
the
guests
sat
in
a
line
facing
a
long
cloth
spread
along
the
floor
food
was
brought
in
on
silver
trays
which
were
placed
on
silver
stools
directly
in
front
of
each
diner
hawksworth
had
scarcely
taken
his
seat
before
a
full
wine
cup
was
placed
in
his
hands
it
was
never
allowed
to
approach
dryness
the
banquet
was
lavish
equaling
anything
he
had
seen
in
agra
it
was
immediately
apparent
that
roast
game
was
the
speciality
of
udaipur
as
tray
after
tray
of
antelope
venison
hare
and
wild
duck
were
placed
before
him
in
its
emphasis
on
roasted
meats
the
food
could
almost
have
been
english
save
it
was
all
seasoned
with
spices
he
had
never
tasted
in
london
the
centerpiece
was
an
elaborately
glazed
wild
boar
the
maharana
had
bagged
personally
from
horseback
with
a
spear
nominal
muslim
though
he
was
prince
jadar
downed
a
generous
portion
of
the
boar
and
praised
the
flavor
the
trays
of
meat
were
accompanied
by
spiced
curds
local
yogurts
and
baked
vegetables
swimming
in
ghee
the
meal
concluded
with
dried
fruits
which
had
been
sugared
and
perfumed
followed
by
the
betel
leaves
wrapped
around
spiced
bhang
currants
sweet
imported
coconut
the
final
offering
eagerly
awaited
by
all
the
rajputs
was
opium
as
they
popped
down
handfuls
of
the
brown
balls
hawksworth
discreetly
signaled
for
more
wine
after
the
dishes
were
cleared
several
jeweled
women
in
red
trousers
and
thin
billowing
blouses
entered
drank
glasses
of
wine
in
honor
of
the
maharana
then
danced
among
the
guests
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
large
sarangi
after
the
dancers
had
been
dismissed
prince
jadar
rose
and
proposed
a
toast
to
the
maharana
the
toast
was
ceremonial
elaborate
and
it
seemed
entirely
expected
by
everyone
to
his
highness
the
maharana
of
udaipur
whose
line
flows
directly
from
the
great
kusa
son
of
rama
king
of
ajodhya
and
the
noble
hero
of
the
ramayana
descendant
of
the
royal
house
of
the
sun
whose
subjects
will
refuse
their
food
if
neither
he
nor
his
brother
the
sun
are
present
to
show
their
face
upon
it
and
bless
it
the
maharana
reply
was
equally
effusive
describing
jadar
as
the
greatest
moghul
warrior
in
all
of
history
the
equal
of
his
mongol
forebears
genghis
khan
and
tamerlane
a
worthy
descendant
of
the
early
moghul
conquerors
babur
and
humayun
and
finally
the
one
moghul
whose
martial
skills
might
actually
approach
those
of
the
fighting
rajputs
of
mewar
an
oblique
reference
to
the
fact
that
jadar
had
led
the
moghul
army
that
subdued
mewar
a
decade
earlier
and
induced
its
rajputs
to
finally
acknowledge
moghul
dominance
over
northwest
india
immoderate
praise
of
one
another
armies
followed
next
then
the
maharana
said
something
else
and
jadar
turned
suddenly
toward
hawksworth
ambassador
hawksworth
his
highness
has
asked
to
speak
with
you
hawksworth
rose
from
the
carpet
and
moved
forward
around
him
the
udaipur
rajputs
studied
him
with
open
curiosity
they
had
listened
to
lavish
toasts
for
years
but
none
had
ever
before
seen
a
a
doublet
the
very
concept
of
such
a
phenomenon
exceeded
their
imagination
his
highness
has
asked
permission
to
allow
his
court
painters
to
make
your
portrait
so
that
he
may
remember
your
likeness
dressed
as
you
are
tonight
do
you
have
any
objection
please
tell
his
highness
i
would
be
honored
hawksworth
found
himself
startled
and
unsure
what
reply
was
appropriate
please
tell
him
that
my
own
father
was
once
a
painter
in
england
jadar
smiled
through
his
teeth
you
mean
i
should
tell
him
there
are
of
course
many
skilled
artists
in
your
noble
land
of
england
your
own
father
as
we
both
know
was
a
great
khan
in
england
not
a
lowly
craftsman
as
hawksworth
nodded
dully
jadar
turned
and
translated
this
to
the
maharana
karan
singh
eyes
brightened
as
he
replied
to
jadar
he
asks
if
your
king
painters
are
expert
in
ragamala
i
not
entirely
sure
what
his
highness
refers
to
hawksworth
examined
jadar
with
a
puzzled
expression
jadar
translated
and
the
rajput
looked
surprised
he
turned
and
quickly
said
something
to
one
of
the
servants
who
vanished
and
reappeared
moments
later
with
a
leatherbound
folio
the
maharana
spoke
briefly
to
jadar
then
passed
the
book
the
maharana
politely
suggests
that
possibly
your
english
painters
have
not
yet
achieved
the
sophistication
required
for
ragamala
he
asks
me
to
show
you
one
of
his
personal
albums
jadar
opened
the
book
and
handed
it
to
hawksworth
it
was
filled
with
vibrant
miniature
paintings
executed
on
heavy
sheets
of
paper
that
had
been
treated
with
a
white
pigment
of
rice
water
and
lavishly
embellished
with
gold
leaf
they
showed
young
women
with
firm
breasts
and
slender
wrists
lounging
in
beautifully
stylized
gardens
and
courtyards
playing
gilded
instruments
or
sensuously
embracing
their
lovers
many
surrounded
by
doves
peacocks
tame
deer
and
elephants
in
some
the
faced
god
krishna
played
an
instrument
that
looked
something
like
a
sitar
to
the
wistful
gaze
of
longing
women
whose
breasts
swelled
through
their
gauze
wraps
the
paintings
imparted
to
hawksworth
a
curious
world
of
emotional
intensity
a
celebration
of
life
love
and
devotion
each
ragamala
painting
depicts
the
mood
of
a
specific
raga
jadar
pointed
to
one
of
a
jeweled
woman
feeding
a
peacock
which
leaned
down
from
a
white
marble
rooftop
while
her
lover
reached
his
arms
to
encircle
her
this
is
a
raga
named
hindol
a
morning
raga
of
love
the
ragamala
paintings
of
mewar
are
a
perfect
blend
of
music
poetry
and
pure
art
jadar
winked
after
the
maharana
has
painted
you
in
your
native
costume
perhaps
he
will
have
his
artists
paint
you
as
the
young
god
krishna
enticing
some
milkmaids
to
your
leafy
bed
the
maharana
spoke
again
to
jadar
he
asks
whether
these
are
anything
like
the
paintings
your
artists
create
for
english
ragas
tell
him
we
do
have
ragas
in
england
our
music
is
different
jadar
tried
to
mask
his
discomfort
perhaps
i
should
merely
say
your
english
ragas
are
in
a
different
style
from
those
we
have
in
india
he
will
not
be
impressed
to
learn
that
english
music
is
not
yet
advanced
enough
to
have
developed
the
raga
jadar
reply
seemed
to
satisfy
the
maharana
he
turned
and
said
something
to
one
of
the
men
sitting
near
him
his
highness
has
ordered
that
you
be
given
an
album
of
ragamala
paintings
to
take
back
to
your
king
so
the
painters
at
his
court
may
try
to
copy
them
and
begin
to
learn
greatness
his
majesty
king
james
will
be
deeply
honored
by
the
rana
gift
hawksworth
bowed
diplomatically
deciding
not
to
inform
the
maharana
that
king
james
had
no
painters
and
little
taste
the
maharana
beamed
in
satisfaction
and
dismissed
hawksworth
with
a
nod
then
the
exchange
of
gifts
began
jadar
produced
a
gold
cloak
for
the
maharana
a
sword
a
jeweled
saddle
and
promised
to
deliver
an
elephant
with
a
silver
howdah
the
maharana
in
turn
gave
jadar
an
emerald
the
size
of
a
large
walnut
a
gilded
shield
studded
with
jewels
and
a
brace
of
jeweled
katars
each
thanked
the
other
extravagantly
and
set
the
presents
aside
then
jadar
suddenly
stood
up
and
began
removing
his
turban
the
room
fell
silent
at
this
unprecedented
act
tonight
in
gratitude
for
his
friendship
for
his
offer
of
an
abode
to
one
who
no
longer
has
any
roof
save
a
tent
i
offer
to
his
highness
the
maharana
of
udaipur
my
own
turban
that
he
may
have
a
lasting
token
of
my
gratitude
that
in
the
years
ahead
when
allah
willing
these
dark
days
are
past
we
will
neither
of
us
forget
my
indebtedness
on
this
night
as
jadar
stepped
forward
to
present
the
turban
the
maharana
eyes
flooded
with
emotion
before
jadar
had
moved
more
than
a
pace
karan
singh
was
on
his
feet
ripping
off
his
own
turban
they
met
in
the
center
of
the
room
each
reverently
placing
his
own
turban
on
the
other
head
then
embracing
hawksworth
looked
around
the
room
and
saw
rajputs
who
would
gut
an
enemy
without
a
blink
now
near
to
tears
he
leaned
back
toward
shirin
what
the
significance
of
the
turbans
it
the
rarest
gift
any
man
could
present
to
another
i
never
before
heard
of
a
moghul
or
a
rajput
giving
his
turban
the
story
of
this
will
be
told
throughout
mewar
we
have
just
seen
the
creation
of
a
legend
then
the
maharana
voice
rose
mewar
the
abode
of
all
that
is
beautiful
in
the
world
is
made
even
more
beautiful
by
your
presence
in
years
past
we
have
stood
shield
to
shield
with
you
tonight
we
embrace
you
in
friendship
we
wish
you
victory
over
those
who
would
deny
you
your
birthright
which
you
have
earned
both
by
blood
and
by
deed
no
other
in
india
is
more
fit
to
reign
more
just
to
govern
more
honorable
to
his
friends
more
feared
by
his
foes
tonight
we
offer
you
our
hand
and
our
prayers
that
lord
krishna
will
always
stand
with
you
hawksworth
turned
to
shirin
and
whispered
what
he
saying
her
eyes
were
dark
he
delaying
his
answer
to
the
prince
offering
him
prayers
to
lord
krishna
prince
jadar
does
need
prayers
to
krishna
he
needs
rajputs
thousands
of
rajputs
but
perhaps
in
time
the
maharana
can
be
convinced
banquets
are
not
the
place
for
negotiation
they
the
place
for
perfumed
talk
jadar
was
smiling
as
though
he
had
just
been
offered
the
whole
of
rajputana
he
managed
to
thank
the
maharana
lavishly
the
maharana
beamed
and
signaled
for
again
signifying
the
evening
was
ended
the
room
emptied
in
moments
i
think
jadar
could
be
in
serious
trouble
hawksworth
turned
to
shirin
as
they
entered
the
hallway
if
he
fails
to
get
support
here
what
will
he
do
i
do
know
i
think
he
may
still
manage
an
alliance
before
through
but
it
will
be
costly
otherwise
he
probably
have
to
move
south
and
try
to
convince
malik
ambar
to
commit
him
his
maratha
army
but
rajputs
are
better
she
moved
closer
i
suddenly
so
very
very
tired
of
armies
and
tents
and
strategies
i
do
know
where
it
will
end
time
is
running
out
for
him
and
for
us
she
brushed
him
lightly
with
her
body
will
you
make
love
to
me
tonight
as
though
we
never
heard
of
rajputs
and
marathas
we
look
at
the
lake
in
the
moonlight
and
forget
everything
just
for
tonight
she
opened
her
hand
inside
were
several
small
brown
balls
i
took
some
of
the
tonight
we
have
no
battles
to
fight
hawksworth
sat
beside
shirin
watching
the
oarsmen
strain
against
the
locks
their
orange
oars
flashing
against
the
ornately
gilded
boat
like
the
immense
gills
of
some
ceremonial
fish
a
turbaned
drummer
sat
at
one
end
sounding
the
beat
and
the
tillerman
stood
behind
him
they
were
headed
for
jagmandir
island
on
the
invitation
of
prince
jadar
in
a
boat
provided
by
maharana
karan
singh
three
weeks
of
banquets
hunting
and
oaths
of
lasting
friendship
seemed
to
have
done
little
to
the
question
of
the
maharana
support
for
rebellion
time
hawksworth
told
himself
is
starting
to
work
heavily
against
the
prince
the
imperial
army
let
us
escape
because
they
were
too
shattered
to
attack
again
but
we
all
know
they
rebuilding
jadar
has
to
decide
soon
how
much
longer
he
can
afford
to
stay
here
and
listen
to
vague
promises
behind
them
the
high
walls
and
turrets
of
the
maharana
palace
towered
above
the
cliff
reflecting
gold
in
the
late
afternoon
sun
as
they
neared
the
island
hawksworth
turned
back
to
see
the
thick
stone
walls
of
the
city
following
the
curve
of
the
surrounding
hilltops
and
finally
angling
down
to
a
tall
watchtower
at
the
very
edge
of
the
lake
he
realized
the
lake
itself
was
actually
the
city
fourth
defense
barrier
ahead
the
white
sandstone
palace
on
jagmandir
glistened
against
the
water
at
the
front
a
large
pavilion
surrounded
by
delicate
white
pillars
jutted
out
into
the
lake
its
entrance
was
guarded
by
a
row
of
stone
elephants
rising
out
of
the
water
their
trunks
raised
above
their
heads
in
silent
salute
as
their
boat
neared
the
arched
entryway
of
the
pavilion
hawksworth
saw
a
veiled
woman
surrounded
by
eunuchs
standing
on
the
dock
to
greet
them
it
her
highness
princess
mumtaz
shirin
voice
was
suddenly
flooded
with
surprised
delight
then
she
turned
to
hawksworth
with
a
laugh
welcome
to
the
ambassador
what
she
doing
here
hawksworth
examined
the
figure
whose
jewels
glistened
in
the
afternoon
sun
then
warily
studied
the
eunuchs
she
come
to
meet
us
shirin
voice
was
lilting
in
anticipation
i
think
she
bored
to
frustration
trapped
on
this
island
prison
as
their
boat
touched
the
dock
mumtaz
moved
forward
and
immediately
embraced
shirin
her
eyes
swept
hawksworth
as
he
bowed
your
highness
mumtaz
giggled
behind
her
veil
and
turned
to
shirin
speaking
in
persian
do
we
have
to
speak
barbarous
turki
because
of
him
just
for
this
afternoon
i
welcome
you
in
the
name
of
his
highness
mumtaz
turki
was
accented
but
otherwise
flawless
he
asked
me
to
meet
you
and
show
you
the
garden
and
the
palace
she
began
chattering
to
shirin
in
a
mixture
of
persian
and
turki
as
they
walked
into
the
garden
it
soon
revealed
itself
to
be
a
matrix
of
bubbling
fountains
and
geometrical
stone
walkways
beside
which
rows
of
brightly
colored
flowers
bloomed
ahead
of
them
the
small
palace
rose
skyward
like
a
lotus
its
top
a
high
dome
with
a
sensuous
curve
the
ground
floor
was
an
open
arcade
with
light
interior
columns
and
a
row
of
connecting
quarters
off
each
side
for
women
and
servants
screened
behind
marble
grillwork
mumtaz
directed
them
on
through
the
garden
and
into
the
cool
arcade
of
the
palace
at
one
side
near
the
back
a
stone
stairway
spiraled
upward
to
the
second
floor
mumtaz
led
the
way
motioning
them
to
follow
at
the
second
floor
they
emerged
into
a
small
chamber
strewn
with
bolsters
and
carpets
that
seemed
to
be
jadar
reception
room
mumtaz
ignored
it
as
she
started
up
the
next
circular
staircase
the
topmost
room
was
tiny
dazzling
white
completely
unfurnished
the
ornate
marble
cupola
of
the
dome
towered
some
thirty
feet
above
their
heads
and
around
the
sides
were
carved
niches
decorated
with
colored
stone
light
beamed
through
the
room
from
a
wide
doorway
leading
to
a
balcony
which
was
also
bare
save
for
an
ornately
carved
sitar
leaned
against
its
railing
his
highness
has
taken
a
particular
fondness
for
this
room
and
refuses
to
allow
anything
to
be
placed
in
it
he
sits
here
for
hours
and
on
the
balcony
there
doing
i
do
know
what
mumtaz
gestured
toward
the
doorway
he
wanted
me
to
bring
you
here
to
wait
for
him
she
sighed
i
agree
with
him
that
this
room
brings
a
great
feeling
of
peace
but
what
good
is
peace
that
can
not
last
i
do
know
how
much
longer
we
can
stay
here
mumtaz
turned
and
hugged
shirin
again
i
so
miss
agra
and
the
jamuna
sometimes
i
wonder
if
we
ever
see
it
again
shirin
stroked
mumtaz
dark
hair
then
said
something
to
her
in
persian
mumtaz
smiled
and
turned
to
hawksworth
do
you
really
love
her
more
than
anything
hawksworth
was
momentarily
startled
by
her
directness
then
take
her
with
you
away
from
here
away
from
all
the
killing
and
death
how
much
longer
can
any
of
us
endure
it
her
hard
eyes
blinked
away
a
hint
of
a
tear
i
lived
most
of
my
life
with
his
highness
in
tents
bearing
children
i
so
weary
of
it
all
and
now
i
wonder
if
we
ever
have
a
place
just
for
ourselves
she
would
have
continued
but
footsteps
sounded
on
the
stone
stairs
and
jadar
emerged
beaming
from
the
stairwell
his
turban
set
rakishly
on
the
side
of
his
head
he
seemed
in
buoyant
spirits
you
here
let
me
welcome
you
and
offer
you
something
to
banish
the
afternoon
heat
he
gave
mumtaz
a
quick
hug
hawksworth
sensed
this
was
not
the
official
jadar
this
was
a
prince
very
much
at
his
ease
i
hope
shirin
will
join
me
in
having
some
but
for
you
captain
i
had
a
surprise
prepared
i
think
you
might
even
like
it
better
than
your
foul
brandy
he
spoke
quickly
to
a
eunuch
waiting
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
then
turned
back
to
hawksworth
and
shirin
have
you
found
the
maharana
palace
to
your
liking
his
view
of
the
lake
and
the
mountains
is
the
finest
in
india
shirin
performed
a
we
so
thank
your
highness
mumtaz
embraced
shirin
once
more
said
something
to
her
in
persian
then
bowed
to
jadar
and
disappeared
down
the
stairwell
he
watched
her
tenderly
until
she
was
gone
before
he
turned
back
to
hawksworth
and
shirin
come
outside
with
me
he
walked
past
them
through
the
marble
doorway
have
you
seen
the
lake
yet
from
the
balcony
this
one
afternoon
we
will
drink
together
and
watch
the
sunset
before
we
all
leave
udaipur
i
wanted
you
to
see
this
place
it
become
very
special
for
me
when
i
sit
here
in
the
cool
afternoon
i
seem
to
forget
all
the
wounds
ever
felt
in
battle
for
a
moment
nothing
else
exists
i
think
this
palace
is
almost
finer
than
the
one
rana
karan
singh
has
hawksworth
stroked
shirin
thigh
as
they
followed
jadar
onto
the
cool
balcony
impulsively
wanting
her
in
his
arms
then
he
cleared
his
throat
i
do
remember
ever
seeing
anything
quite
like
it
in
india
at
times
you
can
be
a
perceptive
man
captain
allah
may
have
showed
his
wisdom
when
he
sent
you
here
jadar
smiled
you
know
i
still
remember
my
first
word
of
your
arrival
and
your
encounter
with
the
portuguese
i
think
that
morning
will
someday
change
the
history
of
both
our
lands
the
morning
india
and
england
met
he
looked
pensively
down
into
the
garden
below
it
all
depends
on
what
happens
next
what
do
you
think
will
happen
highness
shirin
moved
next
to
jadar
at
the
edge
of
the
balcony
he
squinted
into
the
waning
sun
for
a
moment
then
turned
his
eyes
away
it
difficult
to
know
probably
the
imperial
army
will
be
sent
against
me
again
any
day
now
will
the
maharana
support
you
with
his
cavalry
jadar
fell
silent
as
though
choosing
his
words
carefully
then
he
shrugged
away
discretion
i
think
he
might
but
i
still
do
know
i
hear
that
many
of
the
other
ranas
of
rajputana
have
warned
him
not
to
side
with
me
openly
they
still
remember
the
devastation
inayat
latif
wrought
here
fifteen
years
ago
when
he
was
sent
by
arangbar
to
put
down
their
rebellion
rajputs
love
to
battle
but
not
amid
their
own
cities
and
fields
and
that
easy
to
understand
rana
karan
singh
is
in
a
difficult
position
he
knows
if
i
stand
here
and
fight
the
battle
could
well
destroy
udaipur
what
will
you
do
i
probably
have
to
move
out
soon
and
move
quickly
farther
north
into
the
mountains
or
back
south
to
burhanpur
i
ca
stand
and
fight
again
not
yet
that
one
of
the
reasons
i
sent
for
you
he
turned
to
face
hawksworth
i
think
it
time
you
left
india
no
one
in
agra
except
nadir
sharif
knows
you
alive
but
it
obvious
you
return
there
not
under
the
present
circumstances
it
probably
best
that
you
return
to
england
at
least
until
my
fortunes
are
you
must
not
join
me
in
any
more
battles
it
not
your
war
hawksworth
felt
a
sudden
chill
against
his
skin
there
no
reason
for
me
to
leave
and
besides
i
have
no
way
to
return
to
england
now
the
company
is
supposed
to
send
a
voyage
this
autumn
but
there
always
a
way
to
do
anything
captain
jadar
stopped
and
laughed
well
almost
anything
here
at
udaipur
you
only
a
few
days
ride
south
to
our
port
of
cambay
like
surat
it
still
free
of
portuguese
control
i
may
have
very
few
friends
left
in
agra
but
i
do
have
friends
in
cambay
i
can
arrange
for
your
passage
on
an
indian
trader
as
far
as
the
moluccas
where
you
can
doubtless
hail
a
dutch
fleet
you
can
leave
india
secretly
and
safely
no
one
in
agra
need
ever
know
you
helped
me
i
am
not
sure
i
want
to
leave
now
hawksworth
slipped
his
arm
around
shirin
waist
jadar
looked
at
him
and
smiled
but
shirin
has
to
leave
with
you
her
life
is
no
safer
here
now
than
yours
he
fixed
them
both
squarely
i
hereby
command
her
to
accompany
you
you
can
both
return
to
india
someday
if
allah
is
kind
and
i
succeed
and
you
be
first
among
all
my
ambassadors
captain
i
promise
you
you
receive
my
first
trade
but
if
i
die
in
the
days
to
come
your
english
king
will
not
be
accused
someday
of
aiding
a
renegade
i
hereby
order
you
both
to
leave
tomorrow
i
do
run
from
a
fight
there
some
sea
dog
left
in
me
i
know
you
do
captain
and
that
one
of
the
things
i
like
most
about
you
but
i
sending
you
away
ordering
you
to
go
i
always
remember
it
was
against
your
will
jadar
looked
up
to
see
a
eunuch
entering
with
a
tray
of
cups
now
for
your
drink
i
ordered
my
kitchen
to
make
you
i
understand
the
surat
think
it
called
punch
what
is
it
an
indian
delicacy
a
special
blend
of
wine
water
sugar
lemons
and
spices
five
ingredients
actually
just
the
hindi
word
for
five
try
it
hawksworth
tasted
the
perfumed
red
mixture
slices
of
lemon
rind
floating
on
its
surface
it
was
so
delicious
he
almost
drank
it
off
at
one
gulp
jadar
watched
him
smiling
then
lifted
a
cup
of
the
tray
and
gestured
the
eunuch
toward
shirin
i
gather
you
find
it
acceptable
it
perfect
to
watch
a
sunset
with
i
thought
you
like
it
you
know
captain
i
rather
enjoyed
seeing
you
grow
to
understand
and
love
india
that
rare
among
that
why
i
absolutely
insist
your
king
send
you
back
as
his
next
ambassador
nothing
would
please
me
more
i
think
you
mean
it
and
i
want
you
to
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
nothing
would
please
me
more
together
we
rid
india
of
the
portuguese
scourge
forever
jadar
lifted
his
cap
in
a
toast
and
hawksworth
joined
him
and
here
to
ridding
india
of
one
portuguese
in
particular
jadar
paused
who
do
you
mean
the
viceroy
miguel
vaijantes
i
do
think
i
ever
told
you
he
murdered
my
father
in
goa
many
years
ago
jadar
listened
in
silence
i
had
no
idea
then
his
eyes
grew
grim
i
know
him
all
too
well
you
may
or
may
not
be
aware
he
was
once
planning
to
arm
malik
ambar
against
me
unfortunately
there
very
little
i
can
do
about
him
just
now
but
i
have
a
long
memory
too
and
someday
allah
willing
i
put
an
end
to
his
trade
will
that
be
justice
enough
for
us
both
i
drink
to
it
and
i
drink
with
you
jadar
took
a
deep
swallow
of
to
england
and
india
and
now
for
the
other
reason
i
asked
you
both
here
today
to
see
what
you
think
about
something
it
curious
but
living
here
in
this
little
palace
i
found
myself
growing
obsessed
by
an
idea
i
like
to
know
if
you
think
it
mad
he
drank
again
then
signaled
the
waiting
eunuch
to
refill
their
cups
if
i
become
moghul
one
day
i
decided
to
build
something
very
special
for
mumtaz
a
work
of
beauty
unlike
anything
india
has
ever
seen
staying
here
on
jagmandir
island
has
given
me
the
idea
but
first
come
inside
and
let
me
show
you
something
jadar
rose
and
strolled
back
through
the
columned
doorway
into
the
domed
room
did
you
happen
to
notice
this
when
you
came
in
he
pointed
to
one
of
the
high
niches
in
the
curved
walls
hawksworth
realized
that
each
niche
was
decorated
around
its
top
and
sides
with
inlays
of
stones
set
into
the
marble
each
inlay
was
a
painting
of
a
different
flower
do
you
see
what
he
done
here
jadar
motioned
hawksworth
and
shirin
closer
this
is
far
more
than
merely
a
design
it
actually
a
painting
in
rare
colored
stone
onyx
carnelian
jasper
agate
jadar
paused
think
carefully
have
either
of
you
ever
seen
anything
like
this
in
agra
i
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
anywhere
of
course
you
have
this
is
unique
it
truly
astonishing
here
on
jagmandir
island
with
the
design
of
this
room
rana
karan
singh
has
actually
invented
a
new
style
of
art
it
phenomenal
now
look
up
jadar
pointed
to
the
cupola
ceiling
notice
the
sensuous
curve
of
the
dome
like
a
bud
just
before
it
bursts
into
flower
and
at
the
top
you
see
more
inlays
of
precious
stone
i
think
it
the
most
magnificent
thing
i
ever
seen
its
shape
and
color
and
purity
move
me
almost
to
tears
he
paused
and
looked
at
hawksworth
mischievously
so
can
you
guess
what
i
decided
to
do
someday
build
a
room
like
this
in
agra
jadar
exploded
with
laughter
but
this
room
is
so
small
what
sort
of
gift
would
that
be
for
mumtaz
no
captain
if
i
should
eventually
find
myself
ruling
india
i
decided
to
build
mumtaz
an
entire
palace
like
this
a
mahal
all
of
white
marble
and
inlay
i
surround
it
with
a
garden
larger
and
more
beautiful
than
anything
india
has
ever
seen
it
will
be
a
place
of
love
and
of
mystery
with
the
strength
of
a
rajput
warrior
in
the
harsh
sunshine
the
warmth
of
a
persian
woman
in
the
moonlight
the
outside
will
be
covered
with
verses
from
the
quran
carved
in
marble
and
inside
the
walls
will
be
a
garden
of
jeweled
flowers
minarets
will
rise
at
each
corner
calling
all
india
to
prayer
and
its
dome
will
be
a
cupola
with
the
subtle
sensuous
curve
of
a
ripening
bud
it
will
be
immense
the
most
magnificent
mahal
in
the
world
and
it
will
be
my
gift
to
her
he
paused
his
eyes
glowing
is
the
idea
completely
insane
it
beautiful
shirin
was
beaming
i
think
it
magnificent
jadar
seemed
not
to
need
encouragement
as
he
drank
again
from
his
so
now
you
know
the
other
reason
i
invited
you
here
this
afternoon
to
tell
you
what
you
may
see
when
you
return
to
agra
i
have
decided
on
the
exact
location
yet
but
it
will
be
on
the
bank
of
the
jamuna
placed
so
mumtaz
can
watch
the
sun
set
over
the
water
just
as
we
do
here
i
wanted
to
tell
you
both
for
i
sense
you
two
are
among
the
few
who
could
really
appreciate
what
a
bold
idea
this
is
jadar
looked
sharply
at
shirin
now
you
must
never
never
tell
mumtaz
whatever
else
you
two
persians
may
chatter
on
about
for
now
let
keep
it
a
secret
among
us
but
someday
someday
it
will
tell
all
the
world
how
much
i
love
her
he
sighed
you
know
at
times
i
worry
i
nothing
more
than
a
romantic
persian
myself
deep
inside
he
looked
about
the
glistening
walls
once
more
then
reluctantly
turned
and
walked
out
onto
the
balcony
again
the
peace
i
feel
here
overwhelms
me
sometimes
it
quiets
all
the
unrest
in
my
soul
perhaps
i
a
fool
to
ever
think
of
agra
but
agra
is
my
destiny
the
hindus
would
say
it
my
he
stopped
to
watch
as
mumtaz
and
her
women
emerged
from
their
quarters
and
gathered
around
the
fountain
in
the
garden
below
the
evening
air
was
flooded
with
the
women
rose
attar
and
musk
perfume
he
inhaled
deeply
then
turned
to
hawksworth
by
the
way
i
had
a
small
farewell
gift
made
for
you
captain
there
beside
you
he
pointed
to
the
sitar
by
the
railing
i
understand
you
started
learning
to
play
it
hawksworth
turned
startled
and
picked
up
the
instrument
its
workmanship
was
fine
art
with
ivory
inlays
along
both
sides
of
the
body
and
a
neck
carved
as
the
head
of
a
swan
he
found
himself
stunned
i
only
just
begun
to
learn
highness
this
is
much
finer
than
i
deserve
it
worthy
of
an
ustad
then
perhaps
it
will
inspire
you
to
become
a
master
yourself
someday
he
laughed
and
now
i
want
to
hear
how
you
play
it
the
hindus
believe
the
sitar
is
a
window
to
the
soul
that
the
sound
of
the
first
note
tells
everything
there
is
to
know
about
a
man
i
want
to
see
if
actually
understood
anything
since
you
been
here
what
raga
have
you
been
studying
malkauns
an
ambitious
choice
i
seem
to
remember
that
a
devotional
raga
for
late
evening
but
the
sun
almost
down
we
pretend
it
the
moon
just
rising
let
go
inside
where
you
can
sit
hawksworth
carried
the
sitar
and
followed
numbly
as
jadar
led
the
way
back
into
the
tiny
marble
room
the
apprehension
he
had
momentarily
felt
on
the
balcony
seemed
to
dissolve
among
the
bouquets
of
precious
stones
in
the
inlaid
walls
he
slipped
off
his
shoes
and
seated
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
room
then
he
quickly
tested
the
tuning
on
the
strings
both
the
upper
and
the
lower
he
could
already
tell
the
sound
it
produced
was
magnificent
with
the
resonance
of
an
organ
jadar
and
shirin
seated
themselves
opposite
speaking
persian
in
low
voices
as
they
watched
him
cradle
the
round
body
of
the
sitar
in
the
curved
instep
of
his
left
foot
then
they
both
fell
expectantly
silent
he
knew
what
they
were
waiting
to
hear
for
the
raga
malkauns
a
master
would
sound
the
first
note
powerfully
yet
with
a
sense
of
great
subtlety
slipping
his
finger
quickly
down
the
string
and
into
the
note
just
as
it
was
struck
then
instantly
pulling
the
string
across
the
fret
almost
in
the
same
motion
again
raising
the
pitch
and
giving
the
feeling
the
note
had
merely
been
tasted
dipped
down
into
and
out
again
as
it
quavered
into
existence
but
it
was
much
more
than
mere
technique
that
was
the
easiest
part
it
was
a
sense
a
feeling
it
came
not
from
the
hand
but
from
the
heart
the
note
must
be
felt
not
merely
sounded
when
done
with
lightness
life
seemed
to
be
created
a
the
music
that
the
player
and
listener
shared
as
one
but
if
the
player
heart
was
false
regardless
of
how
skilled
he
might
be
then
his
music
was
hollow
and
dead
he
breathed
deeply
trying
to
clear
his
mind
then
slipped
the
wire
plectrum
over
his
finger
and
gently
stroked
the
lower
sympathetic
strings
once
twice
to
establish
the
mood
the
cool
air
was
crisp
and
and
the
sound
rose
gently
upward
toward
the
marble
cupola
above
them
as
he
listened
he
found
himself
looking
at
shirin
and
jadar
their
dark
eyes
delicate
faces
then
his
eyes
moved
beyond
them
to
the
garden
of
inlaid
stones
in
the
marble
walls
and
for
a
moment
he
felt
something
he
had
never
felt
before
this
was
the
india
he
had
until
that
moment
only
been
in
but
here
now
he
was
finally
part
of
it
he
took
another
deep
breath
and
struck
the
first
note
was
perfect
encompassing
he
felt
it
he
knew
it
he
sensed
his
hand
merge
with
the
music
the
music
with
his
own
life
shirin
eyes
seemed
to
melt
and
jadar
immediately
swung
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
approval
then
he
began
to
alap
the
virtuoso
first
section
of
the
raga
meant
to
be
played
solo
and
without
drum
accompaniment
he
felt
the
music
slowly
growing
around
him
as
he
found
and
explored
note
after
note
of
the
raga
structure
he
found
himself
wanting
to
taste
and
feel
each
note
to
its
essence
reluctant
to
move
on
to
the
next
but
each
time
he
was
beckoned
forward
until
at
last
nothing
but
the
music
mattered
he
played
on
and
on
the
intensity
of
the
alap
growing
organically
almost
of
its
own
self
until
it
burst
to
completion
like
a
flower
that
had
gloriously
escaped
the
entrapment
of
its
bud
when
the
final
note
died
into
silence
shirin
slowly
rose
and
slipped
her
arms
around
his
neck
jadar
sat
motionless
for
a
moment
longer
then
reached
out
and
put
his
hand
on
the
strings
of
the
sitar
you
have
earned
it
captain
i
heard
what
i
hoped
to
hear
your
music
tells
me
all
i
want
to
know
about
you
he
rose
and
led
them
back
out
onto
the
balcony
i
know
now
you
can
understand
why
i
also
want
to
create
something
of
beauty
someday
a
mahal
that
will
last
as
long
as
this
music
if
we
can
not
taste
love
and
beauty
our
hearts
are
dead
he
smiled
at
hawksworth
there
is
love
in
your
music
captain
your
heart
is
as
it
should
be
and
in
the
end
nothing
else
really
matters
nothing
else
he
turned
and
stared
pensively
into
the
twilight
my
mahal
will
have
it
too
because
it
is
in
my
own
heart
jadar
stopped
abruptly
and
gazed
toward
the
darkening
shore
through
the
dimming
light
a
boat
could
be
seen
approaching
rowed
furiously
by
lines
of
oarsmen
sitting
in
the
center
on
a
gilded
platform
was
maharana
karan
singh
wearing
full
battle
dress
his
powerful
bow
hung
loosely
from
his
leather
quiver
and
his
shield
rested
at
his
side
jadar
studied
the
boat
for
a
moment
and
concern
gathered
in
his
eyes
he
would
never
come
here
unannounced
merciful
allah
has
the
imperial
army
moved
against
us
already
how
can
it
be
so
soon
my
preparations
have
scarcely
begun
jadar
watched
as
the
maharana
leaped
from
the
boat
almost
before
it
touched
the
marble
dock
the
women
around
mumtaz
fled
the
courtyard
and
now
the
eunuchs
pressed
forward
to
bow
and
welcome
him
he
brushed
them
aside
as
he
moved
quickly
through
the
garden
and
into
the
lower
arcade
of
the
palace
jadar
stood
listening
expectantly
to
the
quick
pad
of
his
footsteps
on
the
stone
stairs
then
walked
inside
to
greet
him
nimaste
my
friend
you
already
missed
the
best
part
of
the
sunset
but
i
have
more
the
maharana
glanced
in
surprise
at
hawksworth
and
shirin
for
a
second
then
turned
and
bowed
quickly
to
jadar
the
news
is
very
bad
highness
then
we
sweeten
it
with
there
is
no
time
highness
there
always
time
for
this
has
been
a
special
afternoon
for
me
highness
i
came
to
tell
you
arangbar
is
dead
the
moghul
of
india
joined
the
immortals
two
days
ago
jadar
examined
him
a
moment
almost
as
though
not
comprehending
then
he
turned
and
stared
out
through
the
balcony
doorway
past
hawksworth
and
shirin
i
would
not
have
wished
it
i
sincerely
would
not
have
wished
it
he
turned
back
to
karan
singh
how
did
he
die
did
janahara
murder
my
father
as
she
killed
so
many
others
no
highness
it
almost
seems
as
though
he
deemed
it
his
time
to
die
two
weeks
ago
he
was
hunting
and
saw
a
beater
stumble
and
fall
over
a
ledge
killing
himself
his
majesty
grew
despondent
saying
he
had
caused
the
man
death
next
he
began
to
declare
it
an
omen
of
his
own
death
he
refused
food
and
drink
finally
even
the
physicians
despaired
he
died
in
his
bed
word
was
given
out
that
he
was
still
hunting
so
the
news
was
carefully
kept
from
all
of
agra
until
the
very
end
how
did
you
learn
nadir
sharif
sent
runners
he
dared
not
send
a
pigeon
jadar
walked
out
onto
the
balcony
and
peered
down
into
the
darkened
garden
after
a
long
moment
he
spoke
allah
then
it
finished
he
turned
back
to
the
rajput
has
janahara
declared
allaudin
moghul
yet
she
has
announced
she
will
do
so
highness
karan
singh
moved
out
onto
the
balcony
next
to
jadar
hesitant
to
interrupt
his
thoughts
the
cries
of
water
birds
flooded
the
evening
air
around
them
jadar
studied
the
garden
again
as
though
lost
in
some
distant
reverie
when
he
spoke
his
voice
seemed
to
emanate
from
a
bottomless
void
allaudin
will
be
in
the
red
fort
it
can
never
be
taken
not
even
with
a
hundred
thousand
rajputs
he
will
never
come
to
face
me
he
will
never
need
to
he
turned
slowly
to
karan
singh
i
lost
it
all
my
friend
and
i
brought
ignominy
to
your
lands
by
my
presence
as
your
guest
for
that
i
am
truly
sorry
karan
singh
stared
at
jadar
but
highness
allaudin
may
not
yet
be
in
agra
you
know
he
wanted
queen
janahara
to
appoint
him
to
command
the
army
sent
against
you
naturally
she
refused
and
instead
convinced
arangbar
to
appoint
him
commander
of
the
forces
to
be
sent
against
the
persian
safavis
threatening
the
northwest
fortress
of
qandahar
it
was
obvious
to
everyone
except
allaudin
that
she
meant
it
to
be
merely
a
ceremonial
appointment
an
excuse
to
elevate
his
to
equal
yours
she
had
carefully
arranged
to
have
him
detained
in
agra
but
he
decided
on
his
own
that
he
would
actually
go
north
to
prove
himself
a
commander
just
before
the
hunting
accident
he
persuaded
arangbar
to
allow
him
to
march
arangbar
was
apparently
drunk
on
wine
and
approved
the
order
before
janahara
discovered
it
allaudin
departed
agra
a
week
ago
with
twenty
thousand
men
and
a
huge
train
of
courtiers
because
of
their
numbers
it
thought
he
has
traveled
very
slowly
but
nadir
sharif
said
as
of
the
day
before
yesterday
he
still
had
not
returned
to
agra
no
one
knows
for
sure
how
near
he
may
actually
be
and
where
are
inayat
latif
and
the
imperial
army
jadar
voice
quickened
of
that
we
not
yet
certain
highness
they
may
be
in
agra
by
now
holding
the
red
fort
for
allaudin
but
we
have
no
way
to
know
jadar
turned
and
seized
his
arm
then
i
will
ride
tonight
have
you
told
my
men
two
thousand
of
my
men
are
now
in
their
saddles
waiting
highness
by
sunup
another
twenty
thousand
will
be
ready
to
ride
jadar
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
then
reached
out
and
touched
the
turban
the
rajput
was
wearing
hawksworth
realized
it
was
jadar
gift
then
give
me
three
of
your
best
horses
tonight
i
will
rotate
as
i
ride
jadar
turned
and
ordered
a
waiting
eunuch
to
bring
his
riding
cloak
his
sword
and
his
katar
i
will
be
riding
with
you
too
highness
karan
singh
stepped
forward
this
time
jadar
embraced
karan
singh
for
a
long
moment
then
he
pulled
back
no
i
will
not
allow
it
if
i
am
too
late
and
the
odds
are
strong
against
me
no
one
who
rides
with
me
will
leave
agra
alive
no
my
friend
this
i
forbid
jadar
silenced
karan
singh
gesture
of
protest
your
offer
is
enough
i
want
my
good
friends
alive
jadar
started
for
the
stairs
then
paused
and
turned
back
to
look
one
last
time
at
hawksworth
and
shirin
so
our
farewell
was
more
timely
than
we
knew
i
regret
we
did
not
have
longer
he
paused
to
take
his
riding
cloak
from
the
eunuch
then
he
reached
for
hawksworth
hand
remember
me
my
friend
and
remember
the
mahal
i
told
no
one
else
if
i
still
alive
when
you
come
again
to
agra
i
take
you
there
if
i
dead
remember
what
i
dreamed
he
turned
and
disappeared
down
the
stairwell
a
tear
stained
shirin
cheek
as
she
watched
him
move
across
the
courtyard
below
when
he
reached
mumtaz
anxiously
waiting
by
the
dock
he
paused
and
said
something
to
her
then
embraced
her
closely
as
he
pulled
away
she
reached
out
to
stop
him
but
he
was
already
joining
the
maharana
in
the
boat
in
moments
they
were
swallowed
in
the
dusk
none
of
us
will
ever
see
him
again
you
know
it
true
voice
was
strangely
quiet
what
does
it
matter
where
allaudin
is
prince
jadar
can
never
challenge
the
troops
janahara
will
have
holding
the
red
fort
not
with
two
thousand
rajputs
not
with
two
hundred
thousand
rajputs
it
impregnable
he
never
see
the
inside
of
the
red
fort
again
she
moved
next
to
him
and
rested
her
head
against
his
chest
will
you
help
me
remember
him
from
tonight
and
the
mahal
he
will
never
live
to
build
i
remember
it
all
he
encircled
her
in
his
arms
wanting
her
warmth
and
together
they
watched
the
last
shafts
of
sun
die
in
the
dark
waters
below
london
sir
randolph
spencer
studied
the
leatherbound
packet
for
a
long
moment
turning
it
apprehensively
in
his
hand
then
he
meticulously
untied
the
wrapping
and
smoothed
the
weathered
parchment
against
the
top
of
his
desk
around
the
timbered
room
the
company
secretaries
waited
nervously
in
prim
wigs
and
doublets
watching
as
he
quickly
scanned
the
contents
then
he
looked
up

and
with
a

be
fully
laded
within
the
month
and
ready
to
sail
in
the
meanwhile
i
forward
this
letter
by
capt
otterinck
of
the
spiegel
bound
this
day
for
amsterdam
to
advise
you
of
certain
new
conditions
affecting
the
company
trade
i
have
inform
you
by
earlier
letter
of
our
entertainment
provided
the
portugals
in
the
surat
bay
with
the
two
of
their
vessels
set
to
fire
by
which
they
were
all
consumed
and
between
four
and
five
hundred
men
slain
burnt
and
drowned
and
of
ours
god
be
praised
only
two
and
some
few
hurt
with
all
commodity
safe
i
have
reported
also
the
loss
of
the
at
surat
by
lamentable
circumstance
yet
i
maintain
great
hope
that
we
are
like
to
discover
profitable
trade
with
the
country
of
india
i
write
now
to
advise
you
the
hollanders
have
late
brought
news
of
a
new
king
of
that
country
reports
have
reached
the
moluccas
that
the
moghul
arangbar
died
suddenly
some
two
months
past
to
be
succeeded
by
one
of
his
sons
whose
pleasure
toward
england
is
uncertain
the
full
events
are
not
clearly
known
here
but
this
will
doubtless
require
our
new
petition
for
license
to
trade
as
is
oft
the
way
in
heathen
lands
the
story
of
the
son
succession
is
a
marvelous
convoluted
tale
there
were
said
to
be
two
sons
in
contention
belike
both
knaves
and
the
hollanders
have
deduced
that
the
late
arangbar
queen
named
janahara
favor
one
son
over
the
other
for
reasons
known
best
to
her
self
and
intrigued
in
his
succession
they
have
concluded
thus
because
the
new
moghul
is
said
to
have
promptly
rewarded
her
with
a
large
secluded
estate
of
her
own
outside
of
agra
with
his
personal
guards
to
protect
her
something
the
dutchmen
claim
has
never
before
been
done
for
a
moorish
queen
in
india
the
hollanders
further
deduce
that
this
queen
effected
the
favored
son
succession
through
her
prime
minister
a
subtle
rogue
called
sharif
who
when
the
moghul
arangbar
died
secretly
arranged
the
assassination
of
the
other
son
before
he
could
reach
agra
and
make
his
own
claim
for
the
throne
this
said
sharif
was
again
appointed
prime
minister
by
the
new
moghul
doubtless
a
reward
for
his
cunning
service
so
it
is
his
majesty
king
james
may
now
desire
to
dispatch
another
ambassador
to
agra
to
petition
this
new
moghul
to
grant
english
trade
if
a
petition
is
to
be
sent
know
that
before
taking
the
throne
this
son
was
called
by
the
name
prince
jadar
though
doubtless
he
is
now
to
be
addressed
formally
as
the
moghul
i
have
as
yet
been
unable
to
discover
whether
the
mission
of
capt
hawksworth
to
agra
authorized
by
your
worship
in
your
wisdom
met
success
though
his
mission
will
no
longer
assist
the
company
in
any
instance
since
he
would
not
be
known
to
this
new
moghul
jadar
however
the
hollanders
have
advised
that
an
english
seaman
named
hawksworth
was
taken
from
an
indian
vessel
off
malabar
one
month
past
in
company
with
a
moorish
woman
by
a
frigate
of
theirs
that
later
was
caught
by
a
storm
off
the
same
malabar
coast
her
mainmast
split
in
that
storm
and
the
vessel
was
lost
sight
of
soon
after
leaving
the
hollanders
to
lament
it
may
have
sunk
or
gone
aground
on
the
coast
together
with
over
five
hundred
ton
of
their
malabar
pepper
if
this
was
our
former
he
is
either
gone
to
god
or
is
now
again
in
india
if
the
vessel
haply
made
landfall
and
saved
the
hollanders
pepper
in
closing
for
the
dutchmen
advise
they
are
preparing
to
hoist
sail
i
am
content
to
report
that
indian
commodity
is
readily
vendable
at
the
port
of
bantam
particularly
fine
calicoes
and
indigo
and
i
adjudge
the
company
would
be
well
advis
to
dispatch
a
new
voyage
to
surat
upon
receipt
of
this
letter
the
monopoly
of
the
portugals
holds
no
more
esp
after
their
humiliation
in
the
late
engagement
off
surat
on
condition
the
company
post
a
gentleman
of
quality
to
agra
one
less
susceptable
to
moorish
ways
than
capt
hawksworth
and
therefore
in
my
judgement
like
to
be
better
respected
by
the
new
moghul
our
subscribers
stand
to
enjoy
great
profit
in
the
company
indies
trade
so
desiring
god
to
add
a
blessing
to
all
endeavours
tending
to
this
business
of
ours
and
of
all
that
may
succeed
us
to
god
glory
and
the
company
benefit
your
worship
faithful
servant
geo
elkington
afterword
for
those
curious
how
much
of
the
foregoing
tale
is
true
perhaps
it
may
be
helpful
to
unmask
the
original
inspiration
for
several
of
the
characters
the
great
moghul
akman
his
son
arangbar
and
primary
consort
queen
janahara
had
counterparts
in
the
great
moghul
akbar
his
successor
jahangir
and
jahangir
resourceful
persian
queen
nur
jahan
nadir
sharif
for
all
his
duplicity
had
nothing
on
jahangir
devious
prime
minister
asaf
khan
the
brother
of
queen
nur
jahan
similarly
prince
jadar
was
no
more
ingenious
and
no
less
wronged
than
asaf
khan
the
subsequent
moghul
and
builder
of
the
taj
mahal
shah
jahan
prince
jadar
strategies
and
intrigues
first
with
and
then
against
queen
janahara
resemble
in
many
ways
those
of
shah
jahan
as
he
struggled
to
thwart
the
ambitions
of
nur
jahan
the
shahbandar
and
the
governor
of
surat
also
had
counterparts
in
real
individuals
as
did
jadar
beloved
mumtaz
his
younger
brother
prince
allaudin
princess
layla
malik
ambar
and
inayat
latif
the
sufi
mystic
samad
was
from
the
poet
sarmad
who
was
admired
by
shah
jahan
and
who
was
executed
by
a
later
moghul
for
precisely
the
reasons
given
in
the
story
of
the
portuguese
father
alvarez
sarmento
was
drawn
in
some
part
from
the
learned
father
jerome
xavier
it
should
be
noted
that
the
unofficial
actions
of
the
early
jesuits
in
india
are
remembered
today
primarily
through
the
perceptions
of
english
travelers
all
of
whom
were
all
staunchly
the
role
of
portuguese
jesuits
in
the
preceding
story
was
faithful
in
spirit
to
the
english
reports
although
today
these
may
seem
mildly
paranoid
in
their
fear
and
suspicion
of
the
english
characters
only
huyghen
and
roger
symmes
are
beholden
to
single
recognizable
individuals
being
jan
van
linschoten
and
ralph
fitch
respectively
brian
hawksworth
is
largely
a
fictional
composite
whose
experiences
recall
in
part
those
of
william
hawkins
in
india
from
to
and
in
part
those
of
other
european
adventurers
his
defeat
of
the
four
portuguese
galleons
was
only
a
slight
dramatization
of
historic
victories
by
severely
outnumbered
english
frigates
off
surat
in
and
commanded
by
english
captains
thomas
best
and
nicholas
downton
both
sailing
for
the
early
east
india
company
hawksworth
mercurial
relationship
with
the
moghul
and
his
experiences
at
the
moghul
court
were
in
part
from
the
letters
and
diaries
of
william
hawkins
and
those
of
his
successor
sir
thomas
roe
as
did
brian
hawksworth
william
hawkins
adopted
the
indian
style
of
life
in
dress
and
diet
much
to
the
astonishment
of
his
european
contemporaries
brian
hawksworth
love
affair
with
shirin
was
suggested
by
william
hawkins
marriage
to
an
indian
women
of
noble
descent
possibly
a
member
of
the
moghul
court
on
the
encouragement
of
jahangir
who
suspected
the
jesuits
of
attempting
to
poison
him
and
wanted
his
food
monitored
hawkins
wife
later
journeyed
to
london
where
she
caused
the
east
india
company
considerable
disruption
over
their
responsibilities
toward
her
and
eventually
she
returned
to
india
although
most
of
the
early
englishmen
in
india
resembled
our
george
elkington
far
more
than
they
did
brian
hawksworth
there
was
one
early
traveler
thomas
coryat
whose
cultural
and
human
sensibilities
would
not
have
clashed
greatly
with
those
of
brian
hawksworth
at
the
end
of
his
story
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
bubonic
plague
in
india
was
taken
from
the
court
history
of
the
moghul
jahangir
similarly
the
capture
of
the
moghul
trading
vessel
by
the
portuguese
intended
to
intimidate
him
and
forestall
an
english
trade
agreement
and
his
retaliatory
closure
of
jesuit
missions
happened
essentially
as
described
the
jesuits
were
allowed
to
reopen
their
missions
a
few
years
later
but
the
damage
was
done
there
seems
evidence
that
the
portuguese
did
conspire
to
assist
the
forces
opposing
the
succession
of
shah
jahan
whom
they
justifiably
feared
the
rebellion
of
shah
jahan
extended
over
several
years
and
did
include
at
one
point
a
stay
on
the
udaipur
island
of
jagmandir
where
some
historians
now
believe
he
first
saw
inlay
work
of
the
type
that
later
became
a
distinguishing
feature
of
his
crowning
creation
the
taj
mahal
for
those
who
may
wish
to
gain
more
familiarity
with
moghul
india
various
sources
can
be
recommended
lively
historical
works
on
the
moghul
period
include
waldemar
hansen
classic
panorama
the
peacock
throne
and
the
even
more
recent
cities
of
mughul
india
by
gavin
hambly
to
mention
two
of
my
favorites
for
those
still
more
curious
and
adventurous
there
are
the
original
writings
from
the
seventeenth
century
which
will
require
more
digging
but
are
decidedly
worth
the
effort
readers
with
access
to
a
major
library
may
be
able
to
find
reprinted
editions
of
the
diaries
of
several
english
and
european
travelers
in
india
these
are
the
works
with
their
trenchant
firsthand
accounts
that
all
students
of
the
era
find
indispensable
perhaps
the
most
easily
obtainable
is
a
collection
entitled
early
travels
in
india
william
foster
which
contains
edited
versions
of
the
diaries
of
william
hawkins
and
several
others
following
this
the
most
thorough
account
of
england
early
diplomacy
in
india
is
contained
in
the
diary
entitled
the
embassy
of
sir
thomas
roe
written
by
england
first
real
ambassador
to
india
many
subsequent
diaries
and
letters
of
european
travelers
have
been
reprinted
by
the
hakluyt
society

publications
comprise
a
virtual
bibliography
of
the
era
the
most
relevant

writings
also

down
by

chief

and
close
friend
abul

in

such
as
this
a
writer
must
necessarily
be
indebted
far
beyond
his
ability
to
acknowledge
adequately
the
scholar
who
provided
the
