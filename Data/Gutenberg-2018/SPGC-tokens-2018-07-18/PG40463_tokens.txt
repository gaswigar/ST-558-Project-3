chapter
i
the
magic
kettle
once
upon
a
time
so
the
story
goes
you
may
read
it
for
yourself
in
the
dear
old
tales
of
hans
christian
andersen
there
was
a
prince
who
disguised
himself
as
a
swineherd
it
was
to
gain
admittance
to
a
beautiful
princess
that
he
thus
came
in
disguise
to
her
father
palace
and
to
attract
her
attention
he
made
a
magic
caldron
hung
around
with
strings
of
silver
bells
whenever
the
water
in
the
caldron
boiled
and
bubbled
the
bells
rang
a
little
tune
to
remind
her
of
him
oh
thou
dear
augustine
all
is
lost
and
gone
they
sang
such
was
the
power
of
the
magic
kettle
that
when
the
water
bubbled
hard
enough
to
set
the
bells
any
one
holding
his
hand
in
the
steam
could
smell
what
was
cooking
in
every
kitchen
in
the
kingdom
it
has
been
many
a
year
since
the
swineherd
kettle
was
set
and
its
string
of
bells
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
a
princess
but
a
time
has
come
for
it
to
be
used
again
not
that
anybody
nowadays
cares
to
know
what
his
neighbour
is
going
to
have
for
dinner
but
all
the
little
princes
and
princesses
in
the
kingdom
want
to
know
what
happened
next
what
happened
after
the
little
colonel
house
party
they
demand
and
they
send
letters
to
the
valley
by
the
score
asking
did
betty
go
blind
did
the
two
little
knights
of
kentucky
ever
meet
joyce
again
or
find
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
did
the
little
colonel
ever
have
any
more
good
times
at
locust
or
did
eugenia
ever
forget
that
she
too
had
started
out
to
build
a
road
of
the
loving
heart
it
would
be
impossible
to
answer
all
these
questions
through
the
so
that
is
why
the
magic
kettle
has
been
dragged
from
its
after
all
these
years
and
set
once
more
gather
in
a
ring
around
it
all
you
who
want
to
know
and
pass
your
curious
fingers
through
its
wreaths
of
rising
steam
now
you
shall
see
the
little
colonel
and
her
guests
of
the
house
party
in
turn
and
the
bells
shall
ring
for
each
a
different
song
but
before
they
begin
for
the
sake
of
some
who
may
happen
to
be
in
your
midst
for
the
first
time
and
do
not
know
what
it
is
all
about
let
the
kettle
give
them
a
glimpse
into
the
past
that
they
may
be
able
to
understand
all
that
is
about
to
be
shown
to
you
those
who
already
know
the
story
need
not
put
their
fingers
into
the
steam
until
the
bells
have
rung
this
explanation
in
parenthesis
in
lloydsboro
valley
stands
an
old
southern
mansion
known
as
locust
the
place
is
named
for
a
long
avenue
of
giant
stretching
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
house
to
entrance
gate
in
a
great
arch
of
green
here
for
years
an
old
confederate
colonel
lived
all
alone
save
for
the
negro
servants
his
only
child
elizabeth
had
married
a
northern
man
against
his
wishes
and
gone
away
from
that
day
he
would
not
allow
her
name
to
be
spoken
in
his
presence
but
she
came
back
to
the
valley
when
her
little
daughter
lloyd
was
five
years
old
people
began
calling
the
child
the
little
colonel
because
she
seemed
to
have
inherited
so
many
of
her
grandfather
lordly
ways
as
well
as
a
goodly
share
of
his
high
temper
the
military
title
seemed
to
suit
her
better
than
her
own
name
for
in
her
fearless
baby
fashion
she
won
her
way
into
the
old
heart
and
he
made
a
complete
surrender
afterward
when
she
and
her
mother
and
papa
jack
went
to
live
with
him
at
locust
one
of
her
favourite
games
was
playing
soldier
the
old
man
never
tired
of
watching
her
march
through
the
wide
halls
with
his
spurs
strapped
to
her
tiny
slipper
heels
and
her
dark
eyes
flashing
out
fearlessly
from
under
the
little
napoleon
cap
she
wore
she
was
eleven
when
she
gave
her
house
party
one
of
the
guests
was
joyce
ware
whom
some
of
you
have
met
perhaps
in
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
a
bright
girl
from
the
west
eugenia
forbes
was
another
she
was
a
distant
cousin
of
lloyd
who
had
no
like
the
other
girls
her
winters
were
spent
in
a
fashionable
new
york
and
her
summers
at
the
except
the
few
weeks
when
her
busy
father
could
find
time
to
take
her
to
some
seaside
resort
the
third
guest
elizabeth
lloyd
lewis
or
betty
as
every
one
lovingly
called
her
was
sherman
little
she
was
an
orphan
boarding
on
a
backwoods
farm
on
green
river
she
had
never
been
on
the
cars
until
lloyd
invitation
found
its
way
to
the
cuckoo
nest
only
these
three
came
to
stay
in
the
house
but
malcolm
and
keith
macintyre
the
two
little
knights
of
kentucky
were
there
nearly
every
day
so
was
rob
moore
one
of
the
little
colonel
summer
neighbours
the
four
bobs
were
four
little
fox
terrier
puppies
named
for
rob
who
had
given
one
to
each
of
the
girls
they
were
so
much
alike
they
could
only
be
distinguished
by
the
colour
of
the
ribbons
tied
around
their
necks
tarbaby
was
the
little
colonel
pony
and
lad
the
one
that
betty
rode
during
her
visit
after
six
weeks
of
picnics
and
parties
and
all
sorts
of
surprises
and
good
times
the
house
party
came
to
a
close
with
a
grand
feast
of
lanterns
joyce
regretfully
went
home
to
the
little
brown
house
in
plainsville
kansas
taking
her
bob
with
her
eugenia
and
her
father
went
to
new
york
but
not
until
they
had
promised
to
come
back
for
betty
in
the
fall
and
take
her
abroad
with
them
it
was
on
account
of
something
that
had
happened
at
the
house
party
but
which
is
too
long
a
tale
to
repeat
here
betty
stayed
on
at
locust
until
the
end
of
the
summer
in
the
house
beautiful
as
she
called
her
godmother
home
and
here
on
the
long
porch
with
its
stately
white
pillars
you
shall
see
them
first
through
the
steam
of
the
magic
caldron
listen
now
the
kettle
boils
and
the
bells
begin
the
story
chapter
ii
the
end
of
the
summer
oh
the
sun
shines
bright
on
my
old
kentucky
home
is
summer
the
darkies
are
gay
the
ripe
and
the
meadows
are
in
bloom
and
the
birds
make
music
all
the
day
it
was
malcolm
who
started
the
old
tune
thrumming
a
soft
accompaniment
on
his
banjo
as
he
sat
leaning
against
one
of
the
great
white
pillars
of
the
porch
then
betty
swinging
in
a
hammock
with
a
new
in
her
lap
began
to
hum
with
him
rob
moore
sitting
on
the
step
below
took
it
up
next
whistling
it
softly
but
the
little
colonel
and
keith
went
on
talking
it
was
a
warm
september
afternoon
and
all
down
the
long
avenue
of
giant
there
was
scarcely
a
leaf
astir
keith
fanned
himself
with
his
hat
as
he
talked
i
wish
schools
had
never
been
invented
he
exclaimed
or
else
there
was
a
law
that
they
could
begin
until
cold
weather
it
makes
me
wild
when
i
think
of
having
to
go
back
to
louisville
and
begin
lessons
in
that
hot
old
town
lloyd
i
do
believe
that
you
are
half
thankful
enough
for
being
able
to
live
in
the
country
all
the
year
round
but
it
is
half
so
nice
out
heah
aftah
you
all
leave
answered
the
little
colonel
you
do
know
how
lonesome
the
valley
is
with
you
all
gone
i
ca
beah
to
pass
judge
moore
place
for
weeks
aftah
the
house
is
closed
for
the
season
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
somebody
dead
when
i
see
every
window
shut
and
all
the
blinds
down
when
betty
goes
home
next
week
i
do
know
how
i
shall
stand
it
to
be
all
by
myself
this
has
been
such
a
lovely
summah
we
had
some
jolly
good
times
that
a
fact
answered
keith
with
a
sigh
to
think
that
they
were
so
nearly
over
then
beating
time
with
his
foot
to
the
music
of
malcolm
banjo
he
began
to
sing
with
the
others
weep
no
more
my
lady
weep
no
more
we
will
sing
one
song
for
my
old
kentucky
home
for
my
old
kentucky
home
far
away
something
in
the
mournful
melody
coupled
with
the
thought
that
this
was
the
end
of
the
summer
and
the
last
of
such
visits
to
beautiful
old
locust
for
many
a
long
day
touched
each
face
with
a
little
shade
of
sadness
for
several
minutes
after
the
last
note
of
the
song
died
away
no
one
spoke
the
only
sounds
were
the
and
the
voices
of
the
cook
grandchildren
who
were
playing
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
as
in
many
old
southern
mansions
the
kitchen
at
locust
was
a
room
some
distance
back
from
the
house
in
the
path
that
led
from
one
to
the
other
three
little
darkies
were
romping
and
tumbling
over
each
other
like
three
black
kittens
fat
old
aunt
cindy
waddling
into
the
pantry
to
or
glanced
at
them
occasionally
through
the
open
window
to
see
that
they
were
in
no
mischief
and
then
went
calmly
on
with
her
baking
she
knew
that
they
were
not
like
white
children
who
need
a
nurse
to
watch
every
step
they
had
taken
care
of
themselves
and
each
other
from
the
time
that
they
had
learned
to
crawl
in
aunt
cindy
slow
journeys
around
the
kitchen
she
stopped
from
time
to
time
to
open
the
oven
door
and
peep
in
finally
she
flung
it
wide
open
and
with
a
satisfied
grunt
took
out
a
big
square
pan
a
warm
delicious
odour
filled
the
kitchen
and
floated
out
around
the
house
to
the
group
on
the
porch
i
smell
gingerbread
exclaimed
rob
starting
up
and
sniffing
the
air
excitedly
with
his
short
freckled
nose
me
too
exclaimed
keith
it
the
best
thing
i
ever
smelled
in
my
life
does
it
make
you
hungry
fairly
starved
answered
malcolm
lloyd
tiptoed
to
the
end
of
the
porch
and
listened
if
aunt
singin
one
of
her
old
tunes
then
i
know
she
was
good
and
i
would
mind
tellin
her
that
we
wanted
the
whole
pan
full
but
if
she
happened
to
be
in
one
of
her
black
tempahs
i
would
ask
for
a
crumb
she
always
grumbles
if
she
has
to
cut
a
cake
while
hot
she
says
it
spoils
them
no
she
is
singin
a
note
somebody
might
slip
it
out
while
she
is
looking
suggested
rob
i
offer
to
try
but
aunt
cindy
seems
to
have
a
grudge
against
me
she
cracked
me
over
the
head
one
day
with
a
gourd
dipper
because
i
spilled
molasses
on
the
pantry
floor
we
wanted
to
make
some
candy
and
lloyd
sent
me
in
through
the
window
to
get
it
i
dropped
the
jug
and
aunt
cindy
charged
at
me
so
furiously
that
i
went
out
of
that
window
a
sight
faster
than
i
came
in
whew
i
can
feel
that
whack
yet
he
added
screwing
up
his
face
and
rubbing
his
head
you
better
believe
kept
out
of
her
reach
ever
since
i
tell
you
what
let
do
suggested
keith
growing
hungrier
every
minute
as
he
snuffed
that
tantalising
fragrance
let
play
that
aunt
cindy
is
an
ogre
a
dreadful
old
fat
black
ogre
and
the
gingerbread
is
some
kind
of
a
magic
cake
that
will
break
the
spell
she
has
cast
over
us
if
we
can
only
manage
to
get
it
and
eat
some
oh
yes
agreed
rob
eagerly
do
you
remember
the
story
that
joyce
used
to
tell
us
about
the
giant
scissors
that
could
do
anything
they
were
bidden
if
the
command
were
only
given
in
rhyme
whoever
rescues
the
cake
will
be
the
magic
scissors
we
can
draw
lots
to
see
who
will
be
it
make
up
a
rhyme
somebody
giant
scissahs
so
bewitchin
get
the
cake
out
of
the
kitchen
ventured
the
little
colonel
after
a
moment
thought
giant
scissors
for
our
sake
will
you
please
to
take
the
cake
added
malcolm
while
betty
followed
with
the
suggestion
giant
scissors
rush
ahead
and
bring
us
back
the
gingerbread
that
the
best
one
said
rob
for
that
calls
the
article
that
starving
for
by
name
now
we
draw
lots
and
see
who
has
to
play
the
part
of
the
scissors
and
storm
old
gruffanuff
castle
carefully
arranging
five
blades
of
grass
between
his
thumbs
he
passed
around
the
circle
saying
the
one
who
draws
the
shortest
piece
has
to
be
there
was
a
shout
from
all
the
others
and
a
groan
from
himself
when
he
discovered
that
the
shortest
piece
had
been
left
between
his
own
thumbs
i
have
to
put
on
my
thinking
cap
and
plan
some
way
to
get
it
by
strategy
he
exclaimed
dropping
down
on
the
steps
again
to
consider
i
would
brave
aunt
cindy
in
single
combat
any
more
than
i
beard
a
lion
in
his
den
help
me
think
of
something
all
of
you
just
then
the
three
little
pickaninnies
who
had
been
playing
in
the
path
by
the
kitchen
door
ran
around
the
corner
of
the
porch
in
hot
pursuit
of
a
grasshopper
here
pearline
called
rob
beckoning
to
the
largest
and
blackest
of
them
the
child
stopped
and
came
slowly
toward
him
her
head
with
its
tight
little
braids
of
wool
sticking
out
in
all
directions
like
tails
was
tipped
shyly
to
one
side
one
finger
was
in
her
mouth
with
the

beatin
aigs
in
de

pearline
was
wriggling
and
screwing
her
little
black
toes
around
in
the
dust
as
she
answered
almost
overcome
with
embarrassment
pearline
said
rob
lowering
his
voice
impressively
do

that
you
could
slip
into
the
kitchen
as
as
a
and
tiptoe
into
the
pantry
behind

back

that
pan
of
gingerbread
out
through
the
window
to
me
while
she
is
looking
i
give
you
a
nickel
if
you
try
pearline
gave
a
swift
inquiring
look
toward
the
little
colonel
and
seeing
her
nod
consent
she
turned
to
rob
with
a
delighted
flash
of
white
teeth
and
yessa
mist
rob
i
kin

the
so

pantry
window
i

bird

a
pewee
when
you
hear
that
pearline
you

she
always

things

on

shelf
under
the
pantry
window
to
cool
and
you

in
and
pass
that
gingerbread
out
to
me
before
she
has
time
to
guess
what
happened
rob
started
off
and
a
moment
later
the
clear
call
of
pewee
floated
up
from
under
the
pantry
window
to
the
waiting
group
on
the
porch
come
on
let
see
the
ogre
get
him
called
keith
just
as
they
rushed
around
the
corner
of
the
house
they
heard
a
scream
and
then
a
mighty
clatter
of
falling
tinware
in
the
kitchen
made
them
pause
there
was
a
scurry
of
flying
feet
through
the
orchard
and
a
snapping
of
dry
twigs
rob
had
made
his
escape
with
the
gingerbread
but
hapless
pearline
had
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
the
ogre
only
for
a
moment
however
through
the
window
came
a
flash
of
red
calico
and
up
the
path
two
bare
black
legs
went
flying
like
windmills
the
broad
of
aunt
cindy
pursuing
slipper
soles
followed
but
it
was
an
uneven
race
pearline
wasting
not
a
single
breath
in
outcry
fled
around
the
house
and
down
the
avenue
like
a
swift
black
shadow
and
her
panting
pursuer
was
left
to
hold
her
fat
sides
in
helpless
wrath
just
you
wait
till
i
get
my
hands
on
you
chile
she
called
with
an
angry
toss
of
her
head
i
make
you
i
learn
you
to
come
carryin
off
white
folkses
vittles
an
scarin
me
out
of
my
seven
senses
no
aunt
cindy
you
touch
her
you
must
do
a
thing
to
pearline
called
the
little
colonel
meeting
her
squarely
in
the
path
and
stamping
her
foot
it
all
ou
fault
because
we
sent
her
and
it
was
rob
who
carried
off
the
gingahbread
there
he
comes
now
aunt
cindy
darted
an
angry
look
at
her
sworn
enemy
as
he
came
up
with
hands
and
mouth
both
full
then
facing
the
children
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
she
launched
into
such
a
scolding
as
only
an
old
black
mammy
who
has
faithfully
served
three
generations
of
a
family
is
permitted
to
give
for
mercy
sakes
aunt
cindy
what
are
you
making
such
a
fuss
for
exclaimed
keith
it
all
your
own
fault
you
know
as
well
as
we
do
that
nobody
in
the
valley
can
make
cake
as
good
as
yours
you
to
have
tempted
us
with
such
delicious
gingerbread
it
the
best
i
ever
tasted
here
he
stuffed
his
mouth
full
again
with
an
ecstatic
but
that
good
and
passed
the
plate
back
to
betty
there
was
no
resisting
the
flattery
of
keith
expression
as
he
swallowed
the
stolen
sweets
a
grim
smile
twitched
aunt
cindy
black
face
but
to
hide
the
fact
that
her
vanity
had
been
touched
by
the
chorus
of
unstinted
praise
which
followed
keith
compliments
she
began
flapping
her
face
with
her
gingham
apron
oh
you
go
she
exclaimed
in
a
gruff
voice
but
knowing
aunt
cindy
they
knew
that
they
had
appeased
her
and
even
pearline
need
no
longer
fear
her
wrath
although
she
grumbled
loudly
all
the
way
back
to
her
savoury
kitchen
they
carried
the
plate
around
to
the
porch
followed
by
the
three
bobs
in
their
big
bows
of
yellow
pink
and
green
who
tumbled
around
their
feet
begging
for
crumbs
until
the
last
one
was
eaten
and
then
curled
up
in
the
hammock
beside
betty
i
wonder
what
we
be
doing
ten
years
from
now
said
malcolm
as
he
picked
up
his
banjo
again
and
began
striking
soft
chords
he
was
looking
dreamily
down
the
long
locust
avenue
where
the
afternoon
shadows
were
lengthening
across
the
lawn
i
be
through
college
by
that
time
and
rob
and
keith
will
be
starting
back
for
their
junior
year
you
girls
will
be
out
in
society
probably
and
old
aunt
cindy
will
surely
be
dead
and
gone
i
wonder
if
we
ever
sit
here
together
again
and
talk
about
old
times
and
laugh
over
this
afternoon
the
way
pearline
flew
through
that
window
it
funny
i
am
more
interested
in
what
i
may
be
doing
ten
weeks
from
now
said
betty
i
have
an
idea
whether
i
be
in
london
or
paris
or
the
black
forest
i
do
know
where
cousin
carl
expects
to
take
us
first
but
i
rather
not
know
the
whole
trip
is
sure
to
be
full
of
delightful
surprises
as
a
is
of
goodies
i
rather
happen
on
them
as
they
come
than
crumble
it
up
to
find
what
there
be
ten
bites
ahead
well
i
know
what
i
be
doing
said
the
little
colonel
decidedly
school
begins
then
and
it
will
be
the
same
old
things
ovah
and
ovah
again
music
lessons
practice
an
school
school
an
practice
an
music
lessons
oh
i
know
what
is
ahead
of
me
all
plain
cake
without
a
single
plum
in
it
do
be
so
sure
of
that
little
daughter
said
a
pleasant
voice
in
the
doorway
and
looking
up
they
saw
sherman
standing
there
with
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
we
can
never
be
sure
of
our
or
even
our
and
here
is
a
surprise
for
you
to
begin
with
lloyd
malcolm
sprang
up
to
bring
her
a
chair
and
lloyd
tumbled
the
bobs
out
of
the
hammock
that
she
might
take
their
place
beside
betty
while
she
listened
to
the
reading
of
the
letter
it
is
from
appleton
from
your
cousin
hetty
began
sherman
turning
to
betty
i
wrote
her
that
you
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
farm
a
little
while
before
starting
abroad
with
eugenia
and
her
father
and
this
is
her
answer
she
has
invited
lloyd
and
me
to
go
with
you
for
a
short
visit
oh
godmother
and
you
go
cried
betty
nearly
spilling
lloyd
out
of
the
hammock
as
she
sprang
up
in
joyful
surprise
you
do
know
how
i
dreaded
leaving
you
and
dear
old
locust
it
will
not
be
half
so
hard
if
you
can
go
with
me
and
i
want
you
both
to
see
davy
and
all
the
places
i
talked
about
so
often
but
how
can
i
miss
school
mothah
cried
the
little
colonel
fall
behind
in
all
my
classes
not
so
far
but
that
you
can
make
it
up
afterward
by
a
little
extra
study
besides
you
will
be
going
to
school
every
day
that
you
are
away
i
do
mean
the
kind
you
are
thinking
of
she
hastened
to
say
seeing
the
look
of
wonder
in
lloyd
eyes
but
every
day
will
be
a
school
day
and
you
learn
more
of
some
things
than
all
your
books
can
teach
you
there
are
all
sorts
of
lessons
waiting
for
you
in
the
cuckoo
nest
lloyd
and
betty
gave
each
other
a
delighted
hug
while
rob
remarked
mournfully
i
wish
my
father
and
mother
wanted
me
to
have
some
school
days
that
are
all
holidays
think
of
it
boys
not
a
line
of
latin
the
five
train
came
rumbling
down
the
track
with
a
shrill
warning
whistle
as
it
passed
the
entrance
gate
at
locust
it
is
time
to
go
keith
exclaimed
malcolm
you
know
we
promised
grandmother
and
aunt
allison
to
be
back
at
five
we
must
say
now
for
ten
whole
months
it
will
be
longer
than
that
for
me
said
betty
wistfully
as
the
boys
came
up
to
shake
hands
there
is
no
telling
what
will
happen
with
the
ocean
between
us
but
no
matter
where
i
go
i
never
forget
how
lovely
you
have
all
been
to
me
this
summer
and
i
always
think
of
this
as
the
dearest
spot
on
earth
my
old
kentucky
home
they
watched
the
three
boys
go
strolling
off
down
the
avenue
shoulder
to
shoulder
feeling
that
all
the
good
times
were
disappearing
with
them
then
they
fell
to
talking
of
the
cuckoo
nest
and
making
plans
for
their
visit
but
what
happened
there
must
wait
to
be
told
at
the
second
bubbling
of
the
caldron
and
another
ringing
of
the
bells
chapter
iii
back
to
the
cuckoo
nest
it
was
very
early
on
a
bright
september
morning
that
sherman
betty
and
lloyd
took
the
train
for
the
cuckoo
nest
but
there
was
such
a
long
time
to
wait
at
the
little
way
station
where
they
changed
cars
that
it
was
nearly
sundown
when
they
came
to
the
end
of
their
journey
appleton
was
waiting
for
them
with
the
big
farm
wagon
into
which
he
lifted
betty
bob
whining
in
his
hamper
sherman
trunk
and
then
betty
shabby
little
leather
one
that
had
gone
away
half
empty
it
was
coming
back
now
nearly
bursting
with
all
that
her
godmother
had
packed
into
it
with
the
magic
necklace
for
love
sweet
sake
shall
we
have
to
wait
long
for
the
carriage
asked
lloyd
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
to
look
down
the
dusty
road
there
is
nothing
in
sight
now
appleton
gave
a
hearty
laugh
as
he
pointed
with
his
whip
to
the
wagon
that
the
kind
of
a
carriage
folks
ride
in
out
here
he
said
i
reckon
you
never
rode
in
one
before
well
it
will
be
a
new
experience
for
you
for
it
jolts
considerable
i
could
put
in
more
than
one
spring
seat
on
account
of
the
trunks
but
there
room
enough
for
you
and
your
ma
beside
me
and
i
brought
along
a
little
stool
for
betty
to
sit
on
lloyd
face
flushed
at
her
mistake
and
she
was
very
quiet
as
they
drove
along
the
wagon
did
jolt
considerable
as
appleton
said
and
she
wondered
if
she
should
find
everything
as
queer
during
her
visit
as
this
ride
from
the
railroad
station
to
the
house
the
spring
seat
was
so
high
that
her
feet
dangled
helplessly
she
could
not
touch
the
floor
of
the
wagon
bed
even
with
her
toes
every
time
they
went
down
a
hill
she
had
to
clutch
her
mother
arm
to
keep
from
pitching
forward
on
top
of
betty
seated
on
the
low
stool
at
her
feet
betty
was
quiet
too
thinking
how
much
had
happened
in
the
three
months
since
she
had
passed
along
that
road
she
had
gone
away
in
a
sunbonnet
with
an
brown
wicker
basket
on
her
arm
and
a
feeling
in
her
frightened
little
heart
that
the
world
was
a
great
jungle
full
of
all
sorts
of
unknown
terrors
she
was
coming
back
now
in
a
hat
as
stylish
as
lloyd
own
with
a
handsome
little
travelling
satchel
in
her
hands
and
a
heartful
of
beautiful
memories
for
she
had
met
nothing
but
kindness
so
far
as
she
had
travelled
in
the
world
wide
jungle
there
the
schoolhouse
she
cried
presently
with
a
thrill
of
pleasure
as
they
passed
the
deserted
playground
overgrown
with
weeds
it
was
still
vacation
time
in
this
country
district
there
our
playhouse
under
the
she
added
half
rising
from
the
stool
to
point
it
out
to
lloyd
and
that
bare
spot
by
the
is
where
we
play
vineyard
and
prisoner
base
we
always
have
so
much
fun
at
recess
the
little
colonel
looked
where
betty
pointed
but
the
schoolhouse
the
weeds
and
the
trampled
spot
of
ground
did
not
suggest
any
good
times
to
her
it
seemed
the
lonesomest
dreariest
place
she
had
ever
seen
and
she
turned
away
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
not
so
slight
however
but
betty
saw
it
then
suddenly
she
began
to
look
at
everything
through
the
little
colonel
eyes
somehow
everything
began
to
appear
ragged
and
and
little
and
countrified
and
common
so
she
did
not
exclaim
again
when
they
passed
any
of
the
other
old
landmarks
that
had
grown
dear
to
her
from
long
acquaintance
there
was
the
tree
and
the
bridge
where
they
always
stopped
to
lean
over
the
railing
and
make
rings
in
the
water
below
by
dropping
pebbles
into
the
clear
pools
and
there
was
the
flat
rock
where
they
could
nearly
always
find
a
clover
and
farther
along
the
stile
where
a
pet
toad
lived
she
and
davy
always
pretended
that
the
toad
was
a
keeper
who
would
not
let
them
climb
the
stile
unless
they
paid
him
with
flies
all
these
places
were
dear
to
betty
and
she
had
intended
to
point
them
out
to
lloyd
as
they
went
along
but
after
that
shrug
she
felt
that
they
would
have
no
interest
for
any
one
but
herself
so
she
sat
quietly
on
the
little
stool
wishing
that
lloyd
could
enjoy
the
ride
home
as
much
as
she
was
doing
oh
how
lonesome
looking
exclaimed
lloyd
as
they
turned
the
last
corner
and
came
to
the
graveyard
with
its
gleaming
tombstones
betty
only
smiled
in
reply
they
were
like
old
friends
to
her
but
of
course
lloyd
could
not
understand
that
she
had
never
strolled
among
them
with
davy
on
summer
afternoons
or
parted
the
tangled
grass
and
myrtle
vines
to
read
the
names
and
verses
on
the
mossy
marbles
or
smelled
the
pinks
and
lilies
growing
over
the
neglected
mounds
the
wild
rose
was
gone
that
had
hung
over
the
old
gray
to
wave
to
betty
the
morning
she
went
away
but
the
same
bush
held
out
a
long
straggling
branch
that
almost
touched
her
face
as
they
drove
past
and
the
sunset
glow
shone
pink
across
it
beside
it
was
the
headstone
with
the
marble
hand
for
ever
pointing
to
the
place
in
the
marble
book
where
were
deeply
carven
the
letters
of
the
text
ye
also
with
that
familiar
greeting
betty
felt
that
at
last
she
had
really
reached
home
and
indeed
that
she
had
scarcely
been
away
for
everything
was
just
as
she
had
left
it
from
the
spicy
smell
of
the
cedar
boughs
to
the
soft
cooing
of
a
dove
in
a
distant
woodland
jingled
in
the
lane
and
the
country
quiet
and
contentment
seemed
to
fill
the
meadows
as
the
sunset
glow
filled
all
the
evening
sky
there
davy
said
appleton
as
a
chubby
barefoot
boy
came
racing
down
the
lane
to
open
the
gate
for
them
and
then
hang
on
the
back
of
the
wagon
as
it
rattled
along
to
the
house
he
has
been
talking
about
you
all
week
betty
he
could
eat
any
dinner
he
was
so
excited
about
your
coming
betty
smiled
back
at
the
beaming
little
face
as
shining
as
yellow
soap
and
perfect
happiness
could
make
it
and
her
conscience
smote
her
that
she
had
not
missed
him
more
and
written
to
him
oftener
while
she
was
away
from
him
but
however
great
his
loneliness
might
have
been
it
was
all
forgotten
at
the
sight
of
her
and
his
delight
was
unbounded
when
the
hamper
was
unstrapped
and
bob
came
tumbling
out
to
frisk
over
his
bare
toes
now
betty
will
have
two
shadows
laughed
appleton
that
boy
follows
her
everywhere
betty
led
the
way
into
the
house
on
the
porch
steps
lloyd
stopped
her
to
whisper
mercy
betty
how
many
children
are
there
several
tow
heads
like
davy
were
peering
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
a
baby
toddled
across
the
porch
squeezing
a
kitten
in
his
arms
there
are
six
altogether
answered
betty
scott
is
just
rob
age
but
he
is
so
bashful
that
you
not
see
much
of
him
then
bradley
he
is
such
a
tease
that
we
keep
out
of
his
way
as
much
as
possible
davy
comes
next
he
the
nicest
in
the
bunch
then
morgan
is
six
and
lee
is
four
and
that
the
baby
over
there
they
have
named
him
yet
so
the
boys
just
call
him
pudding
and
is
that
your
cousin
hetty
whispered
lloyd
as
a
tall
thin
woman
came
out
on
the
porch
to
greet
her
guests
in
that
greeting
betty
forgot
that
appleton
was
only
a
fourth
cousin
her
welcome
was
so
warm
she
thought
only
how
nice
it
was
to
have
a
family
to
come
back
to
looking
into
the
woman
tired
face
with
eyes
that
had
grown
wiser
in
the
summer
absence
the
child
saw
that
it
was
hard
work
and
care
that
had
made
it
grow
old
before
its
time
and
realised
that
the
tenderness
she
had
longed
for
had
been
withheld
only
because
her
cousin
hetty
had
been
too
overworked
to
take
time
to
show
it
maybe
she
might
have
been
as
bright
and
sweet
as
godmother
if
she
had
had
to
work
so
hard
thought
betty
still
i
ca
imagine
godmother
saying
snappy
cross
things
no
matter
how
tired
she
might
get
supper
ready
said
appleton
ushering
them
into
the
house
i
reckon
you
want
to
tidy
up
a
bit
after
that
long
ride
on
the
dusty
cars
well
molly
did
forget
to
fill
the
after
all
though
she
usually
forgets
everything
unless
i
at
her
heels
every
blessed
minute
to
remind
her
molly
repeated
betty
in
surprise
who
is
she
oh
i
forgot
you
did
know
she
is
an
orphan
i
took
from
the
asylum
soon
after
you
left
it
been
such
a
hard
summer
that
i
had
to
have
somebody
to
help
so
appleton
went
to
joseph
orphan
asylum
and
picked
me
out
this
girl
she
fourteen
and
big
for
her
age
but
as
wild
as
a
comanche
indian
so
i
ca
say
she
been
as
much
help
as
hoped
for
but
she
good
to
the
baby
and
she
can
wash
dishes
they
taught
her
that
at
the
asylum
i
tell
you
i
missed
betty
i
did
realise
how
many
steps
you
saved
me
until
you
were
gone
now
if
you
excuse
me
sherman
i
go
and
see
about
supper
find
your
room
just
as
you
left
it
betty
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
betty
the
little
colonel
turned
to
her
mother
with
a
puzzled
face
did
you
evah
see
anything
so
queah
in
all
yo
life
she
asked
a
bed
in
the
pahlah
what
if
somebody
should
come
to
call
aftah
i
gone
to
sleep
oh
i
think
this
place
is
awful
i
do
see
how
people
can
be
happy
living
in
such
an
odd
way
that
is
your
first
holiday
lesson
said
sherman
beginning
to
unpack
her
travelling
bag
you
have
to
learn
that
our
way
of
living
is
not
the
only
way
and
that
people
can
be
just
as
good
and
useful
and
happy
in
one
place
as
another
some
people
are
so
that
they
never
learn
that
they
are
like
that
can
move
only
when
they
have
a
certain
kind
of
track
to
run
on
you
can
be
that
kind
of
a
person
or
you
can
be
like
a
bicycle
able
to
run
on
any
road
from
the
narrowest
path
to
the
broadest
avenue
i
found
that
people
who
can
fit
themselves
to
any
road
they
may
happen
to
be
on
are
the
happiest
and
they
are
the
easiest
to
live
with
that
is
one
of
the
greatest
accomplishments
any
one
can
have
lloyd
i
rather
have
my
little
daughter
able
to
adapt
herself
gracefully
to
all
circumstances
than
to
sing
or
paint
or
model
or
embroider
you
are
going
to
find
things
very
different
here
from
what
you
have
been
accustomed
to
at
home
but
it
would
be
polite
or
kind
to
appear
to
notice
any
difference
for
instance
some
of
the
best
people
i
ever
knew
think
it
is
silly
to
serve
dinner
in
courses
as
we
do
they
like
to
see
everything
on
the
table
at
once
soup
salad
meats
and
desserts
i
hate
everything
all
muttered
the
little
colonel
with
her
face
in
a
towel
i
try
not
to
show
it
mothah
but
afraid
i
ca
help
it
sometimes
meanwhile
betty
with
davy
tagging
after
her
and
bob
frisking
on
ahead
had
started
up
the
steps
to
her
own
little
room
in
the
west
gable
as
she
turned
on
the
landing
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
moved
slightly
and
she
caught
the
gleam
of
a
pair
of
sharp
gray
eyes
peering
at
her
through
the
crack
it
molly
whispered
davy
catching
betty
skirts
and
scrambling
after
her
as
fast
as
his
short
fat
legs
would
allow
say
betty
did
you
know
that
she
a
she
says
that
she
can
go
through
keyholes
and
that
on
dark
nights
she
sails
away
over
the
chimney
on
a
broomstick
with
a
black
cat
on
her
shoulder
even
scott
and
bradley
are
afraid
of
her
they
das
do
anything
she
tells
them
not
to
sh
whispered
betty
warningly
with
a
backward
glance
over
her
shoulder
the
girl
behind
the
door
had
stepped
out
on
the
landing
for
a
better
view
but
she
darted
back
to
her
as
betty
turned
and
their
eyes
met
she
looks
like
a
gypsy
thought
betty
noticing
her
straight
black
hair
hanging
around
her
eyes
and
she
seems
ready
to
dodge
at
a
word
she
tells
us
ghost
stories
every
night
after
supper
exclaimed
davy
they
had
reached
the
gable
room
and
while
betty
hung
up
her
hat
and
unlocked
her
trunk
he
curled
himself
up
comfortably
on
the
foot
of
her
bed
she
can
make
you
shiver
no
matter
how
hot
a
night
it
is
betty
scarcely
noticed
what
the
boy
was
saying
at
any
other
time
she
would
have
been
surprised
at
his
talking
so
much
just
now
she
was
looking
around
her
with
a
feeling
of
strangeness
everything
seemed
so
much
smaller
than
when
she
had
left
the
place
her
room
had
not
seemed
bare
and
cheerless
before
she
went
away
because
she
had
seen
no
better
but
now
remembering
the
pretty
room
that
had
been
hers
in
the
house
beautiful
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
for
a
moment
the
contrast
made
her
homesick
instead
of
the
crystal
candlesticks
here
was
a
battered
tin
one
here
were
no
filmy
curtains
at
the
windows
no
white
fur
rugs
on
a
dark
polished
floor
only
a
breadth
of
faded
rag
carpet
spread
down
on
bare
unpainted
boards
here
was
no
white
with
furnishings
of
gold
and
ivory
no
polished
mirror
in
which
she
could
see
herself
from
head
to
foot
she
looked
mournfully
into
the
tiny
that
was
so
small
that
she
could
see
only
of
her
face
at
a
time
then
from
force
of
habit
she
stood
on
tiptoe
to
see
the
other
half
the
mouth
was
not
smiling
as
it
used
to
in
the
old
days
she
was
recalled
from
her
homesick
reverie
by
davy
voice
again
molly
did
want
you
and
that
other
girl
to
come
here
he
confided
she
said
you
be
snobs
that
all
rich
people
were
bradley
asked
molly
what
a
snob
was
and
said
if
it
was
anything
bad
that
she
should
call
you
that
you
was
one
and
always
tied
his
fingers
up
when
he
cut
hisself
and
helped
him
with
his
tables
and
everything
and
molly
said
she
call
you
what
she
pleased
and
treat
you
just
as
mean
as
you
deserved
and
if
we
dared
say
a
word
she
shut
the
first
one
that
tried
it
up
in
the
in
the
dark
then
she
say
over
us
davy
voice
sank
to
a
frightened
whisper
as
he
rolled
the
dread
word
over
his
tongue
in
unconscious
imitation
of
molly
he
was
quivering
with
excitement
and
his
cheeks
were
unusually
red
he
had
talked
more
in
the
few
minutes
than
he
often
did
in
days
why
davy
what
the
matter
cried
betty
what
do
you
mean
by
abracadabra
hush
do
say
it
so
loud
he
begged
earnestly
it
molly
hoodoo
word
bradley
says
she
can
conjure
you
with
it
same
as
coloured
folks
when
they
put
a
rabbit
foot
on
you
i
had
to
tell
i
afraid
molly
going
to
do
something
mean
to
you
does
your
mother
know
that
she
tells
you
those
silly
things
demanded
betty
turning
on
him
quickly
but
davy
had
lost
his
tongue
now
that
his
confession
was
made
and
only
shook
his
head
in
reply
then
do
listen
to
her
any
more
davy
boy
she
said
taking
him
by
the
ears
and
kissing
him
playfully
first
on
one
dimpled
cheek
and
then
on
the
other
poor
molly
does
know
any
better
and
she
must
have
lived
with
dreadful
people
before
she
went
to
the
orphan
asylum
you
stay
with
lloyd
and
me
after
this
and
do
have
anything
more
to
do
with
her
when
she
tells
you
such
stories
that
just
what
she
said
you
do
said
davy
finding
his
voice
again
she
said
that
you
and
that
other
girl
would
be
stuck
up
and
would
play
with
her
or
let
us
either
and
that
she
always
be
left
out
of
everything
but
she
get
even
with
you
for
coming
in
with
your
high
and
mighty
airs
and
fine
clothes
to
turn
us
against
her
that
the
silliest
thing
i
ever
heard
answered
betty
indignantly
then
a
puzzled
look
crept
into
her
brown
eyes
as
she
stood
pouring
out
the
water
to
wash
her
face
i
ask
godmother
about
it
she
said
to
herself
she
tell
us
how
we
ought
to
treat
her
but
there
was
no
opportunity
that
evening
molly
sat
down
to
the
with
them
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
little
colonel
unused
to
the
primitive
customs
of
farm
life
where
no
social
difference
is
made
between
those
who
are
served
and
those
who
do
the
serving
remembering
her
mother
little
sermon
she
did
not
show
her
surprise
by
the
smallest
change
of
expression
after
supper
betty
offered
to
help
with
the
dishes
as
usual
but
her
cousin
hetty
sent
her
away
saying
it
would
not
do
to
soil
her
pretty
travelling
dress
that
she
was
company
now
and
to
run
away
and
entertain
lloyd
so
betty
with
a
sigh
of
relief
went
back
to
the
porch
where
appleton
with
pudding
in
his
lap
was
talking
with
sherman
betty
hated
and
after
her
long
holiday
at
the
house
party
it
seemed
doubly
hard
to
go
back
to
such
unpleasant
duties
she
did
not
see
the
swift
jealous
look
that
followed
her
from
molly
keen
eyes
or
the
sullen
pout
that
settled
on
the
older
girl
lips
as
left
to
herself
she
rattled
the
cups
and
plates
recklessly
in
her
envious
mood
out
on
the
porch
betty
sank
into
a
comfortable
and
sat
looking
up
at
the
stars
is
it
sweet
and
still
out
here
godmother
she
asked
after
awhile
i
love
to
hear
that
owl
hooting
away
off
in
the
woods
and
listen
to
the
whispering
that
way
and
the
frogs
croaking
down
in
the
meadow
pond
oh
i
do
cried
the
little
colonel
with
something
like
a
sob
in
her
voice
as
she
nestled
her
head
closer
against
her
mother
shoulder
it
makes
me
feel
as
lonesome
as
when
mom
beck
sings
my
friends
i
think
they
the
most
doleful
sounds
i
evah
heard
presently
when
appleton
went
in
to
carry
the
sleepy
baby
to
bed
the
little
colonel
put
her
arms
around
her
mother
neck
whispering
oh
mothah
i
wish
we
were
back
at
locust
i
so
homesick
and
disappointed
in
the
place
ca
we
go
home
in
the
mawnin
i
think
my
little
girl
is
so
tired
and
sleepy
that
she
does
know
what
she
wants
whispered
sherman
in
reply
come
let
me
take
you
to
bed
you
think
differently
in
the
morning
do
you
remember
the
old
song
seen
by
never
look
the
same
by
day
chapter
iv
to
the
next
few
days
went
by
happily
for
the
little
colonel
for
betty
took
her
to
all
her
favourite
haunts
and
kept
her
entertained
from
morning
till
night
once
they
stayed
all
day
in
the
woods
below
the
barn
building
a
playhouse
at
the
base
of
a
great
with
carpets
of
moss
and
cups
and
saucers
made
of
acorns
scott
and
bradley
joined
them
and
for
once
played
peaceably
building
a
furnace
in
the
ravine
with
some
flat
stones
and
an
old
piece
of
stove
pipe
there
they
cooked
their
dinner
davy
was
sent
to
raid
the
garden
and
and
even
lee
and
morgan
were
allowed
a
place
at
the
feast
when
one
came
in
with
a
hatful
of
guinea
eggs
that
he
had
found
in
the
orchard
and
the
other
loaned
his
new
red
wheelbarrow
to
add
to
the
housekeeping
outfit
is
this
fun
exclaimed
the
little
colonel
as
she
watched
betty
who
stood
over
the
furnace
with
a
very
red
face
scrambling
the
eggs
in
an
old
i
bid
to
be
the
cook
next
time
we
play
out
here
and
i
going
to
make
a
furnace
like
this
when
i
go
back
to
locust
high
above
them
up
the
hill
on
the
back
porch
of
the
farmhouse
molly
stood
ironing
sheets
and
towels
whenever
she
glanced
down
into
the
shady
hollow
she
could
see
lloyd
pink
dress
fluttering
along
the
ravine
or
betty
white
sunbonnet
bobbing
up
from
behind
the
rocks
the
laughing
voices
and
the
shouts
of
the
boys
came
tantalisingly
to
her
ears
and
the
old
sullen
pout
settled
on
her
face
as
she
listened
it
is
fair
that
i
should
have
to
work
all
day
long
while
they
are
off
having
a
good
time
she
muttered
slapping
an
iron
angrily
down
on
the
stove
i
they
think
that
because
i
so
big
i
ought
to
care
about
playing
but
i
could
help
growing
so
fast
if
i
nearly
as
big
as
appleton
that
does
keep
me
from
feeling
like
a
little
girl
inside
i
only
a
year
older
than
scott
i
them
i
wish
that
little
sherman
girl
would
fall
into
a
brier
patch
and
scratch
her
face
and
that
a
hornet
would
sting
betty
lewis
smack
in
the
mouth
by
and
by
a
tear
sizzled
down
on
the
hot
iron
in
her
hand
it
fair
she
sobbed
again
for
them
to
have
everything
and
me
nothing
not
even
to
know
where
my
poor
little
sister
is
maybe
beating
her
this
very
minute
or
she
is
shut
up
in
a
dark
closet
crying
for
me
with
that
thought
all
the
distressing
scenes
that
had
made
her
past
life
miserable
began
to
crowd
into
her
mind
and
the
tears
sizzled
faster
and
faster
on
the
hot
iron
as
she
jerked
it
back
and
forth
over
a
long
towel
there
had
been
beatings
and
dark
closets
for
molly
many
a
time
before
she
was
rescued
by
the
orphan
asylum
and
the
great
fear
of
her
life
was
that
there
was
still
the
same
cruel
treatment
for
the
little
sister
who
had
not
been
rescued
but
who
had
been
hidden
away
by
their
drunken
father
when
the
humane
society
made
its
search
for
her
three
years
had
passed
since
they
were
lost
from
each
other
molly
was
only
eleven
then
and
dot
although
nearly
seven
was
such
a
tiny
little
thing
that
she
seemed
only
a
baby
in
her
eyes
many
a
night
when
the
wind
moaned
in
the
chimney
or
the
rats
scampered
in
the
walls
molly
had
started
up
out
of
a
sound
sleep
staring
fearfully
into
the
darkness
thinking
that
she
had
heard
dot
calling
to
her
then
suddenly
remembering
that
dot
was
too
far
away
to
make
her
hear
no
matter
how
wildly
she
might
call
she
had
buried
her
face
in
her
pillow
and
sobbed
and
sobbed
until
she
fell
asleep
the
matron
of
the
asylum
knew
why
she
often
came
down
in
the
morning
with
red
eyes
and
swollen
face
and
the
knowledge
made
her
more
patient
with
the
wayward
girl
nobody
taxed
her
patience
more
than
molly
with
her
unhappy
moods
her
outbursts
of
temper
and
her
suspicious
jealous
disposition
she
loved
to
play
and
yelled
and
ran
like
some
wild
creature
whenever
she
had
a
chance
climbing
the
highest
trees
making
daring
leaps
from
forbidden
heights
and
tearing
her
clothes
into
ribbons
but
she
rebelled
at
having
to
work
and
in
all
the
time
she
was
at
the
asylum
the
matron
had
found
only
one
lovable
trait
in
her
it
was
her
affection
for
the
little
lost
sister
that
made
her
gentle
to
the
smaller
children
on
the
place
and
kind
to
the
animals
she
had
been
happier
since
coming
to
the
appleton
farm
where
there
were
no
rules
and
the
boys
accepted
her
leadership
admiringly
she
found
great
pleasure
in
inventing
wild
tales
for
their
entertainment
in
frightening
them
with
stories
of
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
and
in
teaching
them
new
games
which
she
had
played
in
alleys
with
and
street
gamins
all
that
had
stopped
with
the
arrival
of
the
visitors
their
coming
brought
her
more
work
and
left
her
less
time
to
play
the
sight
of
lloyd
and
betty
in
their
dainty
dresses
aroused
her
worst
jealousy
and
awoke
the
old
bitterness
that
had
grown
up
in
her
slum
life
and
that
always
raged
within
her
whenever
she
saw
people
with
whom
fortune
had
dealt
more
kindly
than
with
herself
all
that
day
while
the
seven
happy
children
played
and
sang
in
the
shady
woodland
she
went
around
at
her
work
with
a
rebellious
feeling
against
her
lot
everything
she
did
was
to
the
tune
of
a
bitter
refrain
that
kept
echoing
through
her
sore
heart
it
is
fair
it
is
fair
late
in
the
afternoon
a
boy
came
riding
up
from
the
railroad
station
with
a
telegram
for
sherman
it
was
the
first
one
that
had
ever
been
sent
to
the
farm
and
bradley
who
had
gone
up
to
the
house
for
a
hatchet
waited
to
watch
sherman
tear
open
the
yellow
envelope
take
it
to
lloyd
please
she
said
after
a
hurried
reading
tell
her
to
hurry
up
to
the
house
thrusting
the
message
into
his
hand
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
to
find
appleton
bradley
felt
very
important
at
being
the
bearer
of
a
telegram
and
ran
down
the
hill
as
fast
as
his
bare
feet
could
carry
him
over
the
briers
and
dry
stubble
he
would
have
teased
lloyd
awhile
by
making
her
guess
what
he
had
before
giving
it
to
her
if
it
had
not
been
for
sherman
request
to
hurry
lloyd
read
the
message
aloud
jane
alarmingly
ill
wants
to
see
you
come
oh
how
provoking
she
exclaimed
i
we
have
to
start
right
off
we
always
do
we
nevah
plan
to
go
anywhere
or
do
anything
without
aunt
jane
gets
sick
and
thinks
goin
to
die
she
an
old
old
lady
she
hastened
to
explain
seeing
betty
shocked
face
she
my
you
know
she
my
grandmothah
sistah
i
would
have
minded
it
so
much
when
we
first
came
she
confessed
but
i
do
want
to
leave
now
one
bit
we
had
a
lovely
time
and
i
hate
to
go
away
befo
i
seen
the
cave
you
promised
to
take
me
to
and
the
glenrock
watahfall
and
all
those
places
it
never
occurred
to
the
little
colonel
that
she
might
be
left
behind
until
she
reached
the
house
and
found
her
mother
with
her
hat
on
packing
her
satchel
i
barely
time
to
catch
the
next
train
she
said
as
lloyd
came
running
into
the
room
it
is
a
drive
to
the
station
you
know
and
there
not
time
to
get
you
and
all
your
things
ready
to
take
with
me
it
would
be
wise
anyhow
for
everything
is
always
in
confusion
at
aunt
jane
when
she
is
appleton
will
take
good
care
of
you
and
you
can
follow
me
next
week
if
aunt
jane
is
better
betty
will
come
with
you
and
we
have
a
nice
little
visit
in
the
city
while
she
does
her
shopping
and
gets
ready
for
her
journey
i
write
to
you
as
soon
as
i
can
decide
when
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
come
aunt
illness
is
probably
half
scare
like
all
her
others
but
still
i
feel
that
i
must
never
lose
a
moment
when
she
sends
for
me
as
she
might
be
worse
than
we
think
sherman
packed
rapidly
while
she
talked
and
almost
before
lloyd
realised
that
she
was
really
to
be
left
behind
a
light
buckboard
was
at
the
door
and
appleton
was
standing
beside
the
horse
head
waiting
there
was
not
even
time
for
lloyd
to
cling
around
her
mother
neck
and
be
petted
and
comforted
for
the
sudden
separation
there
was
a
hasty
hug
a
loving
kiss
and
a
whispered
little
daughter
sorry
to
go
without
her
little
girl
but
it
ca
be
helped
the
time
will
soon
pass
only
a
week
and
remember
this
is
one
of
your
school
days
and
the
lesson
set
for
you
to
learn
is
lloyd
smiled
bravely
while
she
promised
to
be
good
and
not
give
appleton
any
trouble
her
mother
looking
back
as
they
drove
away
saw
the
two
little
girls
standing
with
their
arms
around
each
other
waving
their
handkerchiefs
and
thought
thankfully
i
am
glad
that
lloyd
is
here
with
betty
instead
of
at
locust
she
not
have
time
to
be
lonesome
with
so
many
playmates
it
was
hard
for
lloyd
to
keep
back
the
tears
as
the
carriage
passed
out
of
sight
around
the
corner
of
the
graveyard
but
bradley
challenged
her
to
a
race
and
with
a
loud
whoop
they
all
started
back
to
the
ravine
to
play
she
had
been
busy
making
some
chairs
for
the
little
parlour
at
the
roots
of
the
when
the
telegram
called
her
away
and
now
she
went
back
to
that
delightful
occupation
working
busily
until
the
blew
to
call
the
men
from
the
field
it
was
always
a
pleasure
to
lloyd
to
hear
that
horn
and
several
times
she
had
puffed
at
it
until
she
was
red
in
the
face
in
her
vain
attempts
to
blow
it
herself
all
the
sound
she
could
awaken
was
a
short
dismal
toot
it
was
a
cow
horn
carved
and
polished
that
had
been
used
for
nearly
forty
years
to
call
the
men
from
the
field
when
appleton
puckered
her
lips
to
blow
it
her
thin
cheeks
puffed
out
until
they
were
as
round
and
pink
as
the
baby
and
the
long
mellow
note
went
floating
across
the
fields
clear
and
sweet
till
the
men
at
work
in
the
farthest
field
heard
it
and
answered
with
a
cheer
let
get
molly
to
play
with
us
said
bradley
as
they
trudged
up
the
hill
it
is
a
fine
game
and
if
we
help
her
with
the
dishes
she
get
done
in
just
a
few
minutes
and
we
have
nearly
an
hour
to
play
before
it
gets
dark
the
same
thought
was
in
molly
mind
for
after
supper
she
called
the
boys
aside
and
whispered
to
them
she
wanted
to
slip
away
from
the
girls
and
not
allow
them
to
join
in
the
game
but
bradley
would
not
listen
to
such
an
arrangement
he
insisted
that
the
game
would
not
be
any
fun
without
them
then
molly
growing
jealous
turned
away
with
a
pout
saying
that
she
might
have
known
it
would
be
that
way
they
had
had
plenty
of
fun
before
the
girls
came
but
to
go
ahead
and
do
as
they
pleased
it
did
make
any
difference
to
could
get
on
very
well
by
herself
lloyd
had
gone
down
to
the
with
appleton
but
betty
heard
the
dispute
and
put
an
end
to
it
at
once
here
she
cried
catching
up
a
towel
everybody
come
and
help
and
we
be
through
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
pour
out
the
hot
water
molly
get
another
towel
bradley
we
wipe
and
davy
can
carry
the
dishes
to
the
pantry
we
be
through
before
scott
has
half
filled
the
molly
could
not
keep
her
jealous
mood
and
sulky
frowns
very
long
in
the
midst
of
the
laughing
chatter
that
followed
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
betty
had
talked
her
into
good
humour
with
herself
and
all
the
world
such
light
work
did
the
many
hands
make
of
the
that
the
sky
was
still
pink
with
the
sunset
glow
when
they
were
ready
to
begin
the
game
we
always
go
down
to
the
to
play
said
bradley
i
never
cared
for
it
when
we
played
it
at
school
in
the
but
when
we
play
it
molly
way
it
is
the
most
exciting
game
i
know
we
usually
wait
till
it
begins
to
get
dark
and
the
are
flying
about
illustration
to
their
excited
fancy
she
seemed
a
real
witch
molly
and
i
will
stand
the
crowd
this
time
our
base
will
be
here
at
the
in
front
of
the
barn
and
yours
will
be
the
pasture
bars
down
yonder
the
barn
will
be
and
after
we
call
out
the
questions
and
answers
you
to
try
to
run
around
our
base
to
the
barn
and
back
again
to
yours
without
being
caught
by
a
witch
there
are
six
of
you
so
you
can
have
six
runs
to
and
back
and
if
by
that
time
we
have
caught
half
of
you
the
game
is
ours
the
witch
has
the
right
to
hide
and
jump
out
at
you
from
any
place
she
chooses
but
i
ca
touch
you
except
when
you
pass
my
base
now
shut
your
eyes
till
i
count
one
hundred
while
the
witch
hides
six
pairs
of
hands
were
clasped
over
six
pairs
of
eyes
while
bradley
slowly
counted
and
molly
darting
away
from
his
side
hid
behind
the
one
all
eyes
open
he
shouted
they
looked
around
the
fireflies
were
flashing
across
the
pasture
and
the
dusk
was
beginning
to
deepen
then
six
voices
rang
out
in
chorus
bradley
shrill
pipe
answering
them
how
many
miles
to
score
and
ten
can
i
get
there
by
if
your
legs
are
long
and
and
back
again
out
the
witches
will
catch
you
molly
was
nowhere
in
sight
so
with
a
delicious
thrill
of
excitement
not
knowing
from
what
ambush
they
would
be
pounced
upon
the
six
pilgrims
to
started
off
at
the
top
of
their
speed
across
the
pasture
they
rushed
around
bradley
base
at
the
and
up
to
the
big
barn
door
which
they
were
obliged
to
touch
before
they
could
turn
and
make
a
wild
dash
back
to
the
pasture
bars
just
as
they
reached
the
barn
door
molly
sprang
out
from
behind
the
but
they
could
not
believe
it
was
molly
she
was
so
changed
to
their
excited
fancy
she
seemed
a
real
witch
her
black
hair
was
unbraided
and
streamed
out
in
elfish
wisps
from
under
a
tall
pointed
black
hat
a
hideous
mask
covered
her
face
and
she
brandished
the
stump
of
an
old
broom
with
such
effect
that
they
ran
from
her
shrieking
wildly
some
heavy
wrapping
paper
a
strip
of
white
cotton
cloth
and
from
the
bottom
of
a
stove
lid
had
changed
an
ordinary
girl
of
fourteen
into
a
nameless
terror
from
which
they
fled
shrieking
at
the
top
of
their
voices
the
boys
had
been
through
the
performance
many
times
but
they
enjoyed
the
cold
thrill
it
gave
them
as
much
as
betty
and
lloyd
who
were
feeling
it
for
the
first
time
lee
was
caught
in
that
first
mad
race
and
morgan
in
the
second
and
they
had
to
go
over
to
the
enemy
base
where
bradley
stood
guard
under
the
as
they
came
in
from
the
third
run
lloyd
leaned
against
the
pasture
bars
out
of
breath
oh
i
believe
i
should
drop
dead
she
panted
if
that
awful
thing
should
get
me
i
ca
believe
that
it
is
only
molly
she
seems
like
a
real
suah
witch
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
again
with
a
little
nervous
shudder
as
the
others
began
calling
again
many
miles
to
betty
was
caught
this
time
and
lloyd
to
whom
the
game
was
becoming
a
terrible
reality
stood
with
her
heart
beating
like
a
and
her
eyes
peering
in
a
startled
way
through
the
dusk
this
time
the
witch
popped
up
from
behind
the
pasture
bars
and
lloyd
giving
a
startled
look
over
her
shoulder
as
she
flew
saw
that
the
broomstick
was
flourished
in
her
direction
and
the
hideous
black
and
white
mask
was
almost
upon
her
with
an
scream
she
redoubled
her
speed
racing
around
and
around
the
barn
instead
of
touching
the
door
and
turning
back
when
she
saw
that
she
was
followed
finally
with
one
sharp
scream
of
terror
after
another
she
darted
into
the
great
dark
barn
in
a
blind
frenzy
to
escape
she
heard
the
voices
of
the
children
outside
the
bang
of
the
broomstick
against
the
door
and
then
plunging
forward
felt
herself
falling
falling
there
was
just
an
instant
in
which
she
seemed
to
see
the
faces
of
her
mother
and
papa
jack
then
she
remembered
nothing
more
for
her
head
struck
something
hard
and
she
lay
in
a
little
heap
on
the
floor
below
she
had
fallen
through
a
into
an
empty
manger
chapter
a
time
for
patience
they
thought
at
first
that
she
was
hiding
in
the
barn
afraid
to
come
out
lest
molly
might
be
lying
in
wait
to
grab
her
so
they
began
calling
come
on
lloyd
king
x
king
excuse
home
free
you
may
come
home
free
but
there
was
no
answer
and
betty
suddenly
remembering
the
grew
white
with
fear
the
children
played
in
the
barn
so
much
that
appleton
first
order
when
he
hired
a
new
man
was
that
the
must
always
be
closed
and
fastened
the
moment
he
finished
pitching
the
hay
down
to
the
manger
below
the
children
themselves
had
been
cautioned
time
and
again
to
keep
away
from
it
but
lloyd
never
having
played
in
the
barn
before
was
not
aware
of
its
existence
lloyd
lloyd
called
betty
hurrying
into
the
twilight
of
the
big
barn
there
was
no
answer
and
peering
anxiously
ahead
betty
saw
that
the
was
open
and
on
the
floor
below
was
the
gleam
of
the
little
colonel
light
pink
dress
shining
white
through
the
dusk
betty
startled
cry
brought
the
other
children
who
clattered
down
the
barn
stairs
after
her
into
the
circle
where
the
young
calves
were
kept
they
met
appleton
coming
in
from
the
with
a
basket
on
his
shoulder
and
all
began
to
talk
at
once
the
words
lloyd
and
were
all
he
could
distinguish
in
the
jumble
of
excited
exclamations
but
they
told
the
whole
story
hastily
dropping
his
basket
he
strode
across
to
the
manger
that
betty
pointed
out
with
a
look
of
grave
concern
on
his
face
they
all
crowded
breathlessly
around
him
as
he
bent
over
the
quiet
little
figure
lifting
it
gently
in
his
arms
it
was
a
little
company
that
followed
him
up
the
hill
with
his
unconscious
burden
a
cold
fear
seized
betty
as
she
walked
along
glancing
at
the
little
colonel
closed
eyes
and
the
tiny
stream
of
blood
trickling
across
the
still
white
face
oh
if
godmother
were
only
here
she
groaned
there
no
telling
how
badly
lloyd
is
hurt
maybe
she
be
a
cripple
for
life
oh
i
wish
i
never
heard
of
such
a
game
as
if
the
accident
had
happened
at
locust
a
doctor
would
have
been
summoned
to
the
spot
as
fast
as
telephones
and
swift
horses
could
bring
him
and
the
whole
household
would
have
held
its
breath
in
anxiety
but
very
little
fuss
was
made
over
accidents
at
the
cuckoo
nest
it
was
a
weekly
occurrence
for
some
of
the
children
to
be
brought
in
limp
and
bleeding
from
various
falls
bradley
had
once
sprained
his
neck
turning
somersaults
down
the
so
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
look
over
his
shoulder
for
two
weeks
scott
had
been
picked
up
senseless
twice
once
from
falling
out
of
the
top
of
a
and
the
other
time
because
a
high
ladder
broke
under
him
every
one
of
the
boys
but
pudding
had
at
some
time
or
another
left
a
trail
of
blood
behind
him
from
barn
to
house
as
he
went
weeping
homeward
with
some
part
of
his
body
to
be
bandaged
so
lloyd
fall
did
not
cause
the
commotion
it
might
have
done
in
a
less
adventurous
family
oh
she
coming
around
all
right
said
appleton
cheerfully
as
her
head
stirred
a
little
on
his
shoulder
and
she
half
opened
her
eyes
here
you
are
he
added
a
moment
later
laying
her
on
the
bed
in
the
parlour
scott
run
call
your
mother
bring
a
light
molly
we
soon
see
what
is
the
matter
there
were
no
bones
broken
and
in
a
little
while
lloyd
sat
up
white
and
dizzy
then
she
walked
across
the
room
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
little
mirror
hanging
over
a
shelf
on
which
stood
a
bouquet
of
stiff
wax
flowers
it
was
hung
so
high
and
tilted
forward
so
much
and
the
wax
flowers
were
in
the
way
so
that
she
could
not
get
a
very
satisfactory
view
of
her
wounds
but
she
saw
enough
to
make
her
feel
like
an
old
soldier
home
from
the
wars
with
the
marks
of
many
battles
upon
her
a
bandage
wet
with
arnica
was
tied
around
her
head
over
a
large
knot
that
was
rapidly
swelling
larger
several
strips
of
covered
the
cut
on
her
temple
one
cheek
was
scratched
and
she
was
stiff
and
sore
from
many
bruises
but
not
half
so
stiff
as
you
be
in
the
morning
appleton
assured
her
cheerfully
all
that
side
of
your
body
that
struck
against
the
manger
is
black
and
blue
i
think
i
go
to
bed
said
the
little
colonel
faintly
this
day
has
been
long
enough
and
i
do
want
anything
else
to
happen
to
me
fallin
through
a
and
havin
my
mothah
leave
me
is
enough
one
while
i
think
i
need
her
moah
than
aunt
jane
does
you
have
to
sleep
with
me
betty
i
would
stay
down
heah
alone
anything
it
was
very
early
to
go
to
bed
scarcely
more
than
seven
when
betty
blew
out
the
candle
and
climbed
in
beside
the
little
colonel
she
lay
for
a
long
time
listening
to
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
thinking
that
lloyd
had
forgotten
her
troubles
in
dreamland
until
a
mournful
little
voice
whispered
say
betty
are
you
asleep
no
but
i
thought
you
were
i
was
for
a
few
minutes
but
that
dreadful
false
face
of
molly
woke
me
up
i
dreamed
it
was
chasing
me
and
i
seemed
to
be
falling
and
falling
and
somebody
screamed
at
me
out
the
witches
will
catch
you
it
frightened
me
so
that
i
woke
up
all
a
tremble
i
know
i
am
safe
here
in
bed
with
you
but
i
shaking
so
hard
that
i
ca
go
to
sleep
again
oh
betty
you
do
know
how
much
i
want
my
mothah
nevah
leave
her
again
as
long
as
i
live
my
head
aches
and
i
so
stiff
and
soah
i
ca
ovah
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
a
story
asked
betty
hearing
the
sob
in
lloyd
voice
and
divining
that
her
pillow
had
caught
more
than
one
tear
under
cover
of
the
darkness
oh
yes
begged
the
little
colonel
talk
to
me
even
if
you
do
say
anything
but
the
multiplication
table
it
will
keep
me
from
those
dreadful
frogs
and
seein
that
face
in
the
dark
i
ashamed
to
be
frightened
at
nothing
i
do
know
what
makes
me
such
a
coward
maybe
the
fall
was
a
sort
of
shock
to
your
nerves
said
betty
comfortingly
reaching
out
to
pat
the
trembling
shoulders
with
a
motherly
air
there
go
to
sleep
and
i
stay
awake
and
keep
away
the
hobgoblins
i
recite
the
lady
jane
because
it
jingles
so
beautifully
it
goes
like
a
cradle
a
little
groping
hand
reached
through
the
darkness
and
touched
face
then
buried
itself
in
her
soft
curls
as
if
the
touch
brought
a
soothing
sense
of
safety
in
a
slow
tone
as
monotonous
as
the
droning
of
a
bee
betty
began
accenting
every
other
syllable
with
a
sleepy
drawl
the
was
and
the
was
sir
her
was
of
his
was
and
his
were
and
he
green
with
a
shell
and
his
was
in
the
and
was
of
and
were
a
and
the
and
the
of
this
and
his
were
with
the
but
it
took
more
than
the
lady
jane
to
put
the
restless
little
listener
to
sleep
that
night
maud
muller
was
recited
in
the
same
measure
and
lord
ullin
daughter
followed
without
a
pause
till
betty
herself
grew
sleepy
and
like
a
tired
little
mosquito
droned
lower
and
lower
finally
stopping
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
they
woke
in
the
morning
to
hear
thunder
rumbling
in
the
distance
betty
peeping
through
the
curtains
announced
that
the
sky
was
gray
with
clouds
and
she
thought
that
it
must
surely
begin
to
rain
soon
lloyd
so
stiff
and
sore
from
the
effects
of
her
fall
that
she
could
scarcely
move
sat
up
with
a
groan
oh
deah
she
exclaimed
what
is
there
to
do
heah
on
rainy
days
no
books
no
games
no
piano
mothah
said
that
the
lesson
set
fo
me
to
learn
was
patience
but
i
lose
my
mind
just
sitting
still
in
front
of
a
clock
and
watching
the
minutes
go
by
i
do
see
how
job
stood
it
job
did
do
that
way
said
betty
soberly
as
she
looked
up
from
lacing
her
shoes
they
did
have
any
clocks
in
those
days
and
besides
patience
is
just
sitting
still
all
day
without
fidgeting
it
putting
up
with
whatever
happens
to
you
without
making
a
fuss
about
it
the
best
way
to
do
it
is
not
to
think
about
it
any
more
than
you
can
help
i
like
to
know
how
i
goin
to
keep
from
thinkin
about
my
bruises
and
cuts
groaned
the
little
colonel
limping
stiffly
across
the
room
to
look
again
in
the
little
mirror
at
her
bandaged
forehead
her
scratched
cheek
and
her
temple
with
strips
of
what
papa
jack
say
if
he
could
see
me
now
she
repeated
betty
definition
of
patience
to
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
making
a
wry
face
as
she
did
so
up
with
whatevah
happens
to
you
without
makin
a
fuss
about
it
well
i
try
but
it
mighty
hard
to
do
when
one
of
the
happenings
is
fallin
through
a
and
gettin
as
stiff
and
soah
as
i
am
she
thought
about
the
definition
more
than
once
during
the
long
morning
that
followed
when
the
hash
was
too
salty
at
breakfast
and
the
oatmeal
was
scorched
when
betty
was
busy
in
the
and
she
was
left
all
alone
for
awhile
with
nothing
to
entertain
herself
with
but
the
almanac
and
a
paper
the
thunder
that
had
been
only
a
low
muttering
over
the
distant
hills
when
they
awoke
was
coming
nearer
and
the
damp
air
was
heavy
with
the
approaching
storm
i
have
one
little
run
befo
it
begins
to
rain
thought
lloyd
and
started
up
to
skip
across
the
porch
but
her
skipping
changed
to
a
painful
walk
as
her
aching
muscles
reminded
her
of
her
fall
and
she
limped
slowly
down
the
lane
toward
the
gate
a
strong
wind
suddenly
began
lashing
the
that
lined
the
lane
and
sent
a
gust
of
dust
and
leaves
into
her
face
she
stopped
a
moment
to
rub
her
eyes
and
as
she
did
so
something
fluttering
on
the
broke
loose
from
the
thorns
that
held
it
and
came
blowing
toward
her
it
was
something
soft
and
gray
and
it
fluttered
along
uncertainly
like
a
bit
of
fleecy
thistledown
as
the
wind
bore
it
to
her
feet
oh
it
mothah
gray
veil
she
exclaimed
it
was
on
the
back
of
the
seat
when
she
waved
to
me
and
they
were
drivin
so
fast
it
must
have
blown
away
she
picked
up
the
dainty
piece
of
silk
tissue
soft
and
filmy
as
a
cloud
and
held
it
against
her
cheek
then
she
hurried
into
the
house
with
it
lest
some
of
the
boys
should
see
her
and
notice
the
tears
in
her
eyes
but
inside
the
dark
closet
where
she
climbed
to
lay
the
veil
on
a
shelf
the
lonely
feeling
was
too
strong
for
her
to
overcome
crouching
down
in
a
corner
with
her
face
hidden
in
the
soft
veil
she
cried
quietly
for
a
long
time
then
something
came
to
her
mind
that
had
happened
when
she
was
only
five
years
old
before
she
had
gone
to
locust
to
live
it
was
that
first
lonesome
evening
when
she
had
been
left
to
spend
the
night
at
her
grandfather
and
she
grew
so
homesick
as
twilight
fell
that
she
decided
to
run
away
and
while
she
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
great
gate
peering
through
the
bars
at
the
darkening
world
outside
fritz
the
wisest
little
terrier
that
ever
peeped
through
tangled
bangs
found
something
in
the
dead
leaves
at
her
feet
it
was
a
little
gray
glove
that
her
mother
had
dropped
when
she
stooped
to
kiss
her
lloyd
remembered
how
she
had
squeezed
it
and
cried
over
it
and
fondled
it
as
if
it
held
the
touch
of
her
mother
hand
and
then
baby
though
she
was
she
had
tucked
it
into
her
tiny
apron
pocket
as
a
talisman
to
help
her
be
brave
then
she
walked
back
to
the
house
without
another
tear
that
visit
had
a
beautiful
ending
thought
lloyd
tenderly
folding
the
veil
then
i
had
only
fritz
for
company
but
now
i
have
betty
just
stop
wishin
i
could
run
away
from
the
cuckoo
nest
and
i
have
all
the
good
times
that
i
can
get
out
of
this
visit
she
felt
better
now
the
tears
seemed
to
have
washed
away
the
ache
in
her
throat
bradley
was
calling
her
and
only
stopping
at
the
a
moment
to
bathe
her
red
eyes
she
went
out
to
see
what
he
wanted
his
freckled
face
was
all
alight
with
a
beaming
smile
as
if
he
were
the
bearer
of
good
news
his
hands
were
behind
his
back
and
as
he
came
toward
her
he
called
out
in
the
pleasantest
of
voices
which
will
you
take
lloyd
right
or
left
forgetting
that
betty
had
cautioned
her
about
his
love
of
teasing
and
remembering
the
apples
he
had
brought
her
the
day
before
she
answered
with
a
friendly
smile
i
choose
what
in
the
right
hand
then
shut
your
eyes
and
hold
fast
all
i
give
you
squinting
her
eyelids
tightly
together
lloyd
held
out
her
unsuspecting
little
hand
only
to
receive
a
squirming
bunch
of
clammy
wriggling
fishing
worms
she
gave
a
loud
shriek
and
wrung
the
hand
that
the
worms
had
touched
as
if
it
had
been
stung
bradley
appleton
you
horrid
boy
she
cried
how
could
you
be
so
mean
there
nothing
i
like
worms
i
could
touch
a
mouse
or
even
a
snake
soonah
than
those
bare
crawly
things
oh
i
nevah
nevah
be
able
to
get
the
feel
of
them
off
my
hands
even
if
i
should
scrub
them
a
week
i
do
mind
things
with
feet
but
the
feel
of
the
squirmin
is
awful
bradley
laughed
so
loudly
over
the
success
of
his
joke
that
betty
came
out
smiling
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
was
surprised
to
see
lloyd
marching
indignantly
into
the
house
her
head
held
high
and
her
face
very
red
well
i
did
do
anything
but
give
her
a
handful
of
angleworms
said
bradley
in
reply
to
betty
demand
for
an
explanation
molly
heard
her
say
that
she
despised
worms
and
that
nothing
could
make
her
touch
one
or
put
it
on
a
hook
i
was
just
showing
her
for
her
own
good
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
in
a
harmless
little
and
she
had
to
go
off
and
get
mad
girls
are
such
touchy
things
they
make
me
tired
long
experience
had
taught
betty
that
the
best
thing
to
do
when
bradley
was
in
a
teasing
mood
was
to
keep
out
of
his
way
so
she
turned
without
a
word
and
went
in
search
of
lloyd
as
she
did
so
the
rain
that
they
had
been
expecting
all
morning
came
dashing
against
the
in
torrents
suddenly
it
grew
so
dark
one
could
scarcely
see
to
read
without
lighting
a
lamp
come
up
to
my
room
lloyd
called
betty
stopping
at
the
parlour
door
with
davy
tagging
behind
her
it
lighter
up
there
and
i
love
to
be
close
up
under
the
roof
when
the
rain
patters
on
it
wait
till
i
finish
washing
my
hands
answered
lloyd
looking
up
with
a
disgusted
face
ugh
i
ca
wash
away
that
horrid
squirmin
feelin
even
with
a
as
davy
climbed
the
stairs
after
them
he
caught
lloyd
by
the
dress
say
he
exclaimed
in
a
half
whisper
it
was
molly
that
told
bradley
to
put
those
worms
on
you
she
dared
him
to
and
they
laughing
about
it
now
down
in
the
kitchen
it
was
on
the
tip
of
lloyd
tongue
to
say
they
both
of
them
mean
hateful
things
and
i
get
even
with
them
if
it
takes
all
the
rest
of
my
visit
to
do
it
but
before
the
words
could
slip
out
she
remembered
the
definition
putting
up
with
anything
that
happens
to
you
without
making
a
fuss
about
it
there
could
anything
nastier
happen
than
she
said
to
herself
so
this
must
be
one
of
the
times
i
need
patience
the
very
most
although
the
lesson
was
remembered
in
time
to
keep
her
from
getting
into
a
rage
it
did
not
put
her
into
a
good
humour
it
was
a
very
unhappy
little
face
that
looked
out
of
the
gable
window
against
which
the
autumn
rain
was
dashing
her
head
ached
from
all
its
bumps
and
bruises
and
her
eyes
wore
as
forlorn
an
expression
as
if
she
were
some
unhappy
crusoe
cast
away
on
a
desert
island
with
no
hope
of
rescue
davy
perched
himself
on
the
trunk
and
awaited
developments
betty
looked
around
the
room
in
search
of
something
to
brighten
the
dull
day
but
the
bare
walls
offered
no
suggestion
of
entertainment
lloyd
fingers
drumming
restlessly
on
the
and
the
patter
of
the
rain
on
the
roof
were
the
only
sounds
in
the
room
i
wondah
if
it
rainin
where
joyce
and
eugenia
are
said
the
little
colonel
after
awhile
breaking
the
long
silence
oh
let
write
to
them
cried
betty
eagerly
one
can
write
east
and
one
can
write
west
and
we
tell
them
all
that
has
happened
in
the
cuckoo
nest
since
we
came
back
to
it
davy
slid
off
the
trunk
in
silent
disapproval
when
the
writing
material
was
brought
out
and
the
girls
began
their
letters
the
scratching
of
the
pens
across
the
paper
and
the
dismal
dripping
of
the
rain
was
too
monotonous
for
him
and
he
felt
forced
to
go
below
in
search
of
livelier
companionship
chapter
vi
molly
story
they
had
been
writing
a
long
time
when
the
little
colonel
looked
up
with
a
mischievous
smile
joyce
will
think
that
this
is
a
wondahful
place
she
said
i
told
her
all
about
my
bein
chased
by
a
witch
and
how
ugly
she
was
and
what
davy
said
about
her
goin
through
keyholes
it
sounds
so
real
when
i
read
it
ovah
that
i
could
make
myself
believe
that
she
is
one
i
goin
to
slip
across
into
her
room
now
and
see
if
i
ca
find
the
broomstick
that
she
rides
around
on
at
night
if
there
just
be
a
black
cat
sittin
on
her
pillow
i
could
almost
believe
what
davy
said
about
her
hoodoo
word
would
she
be
mad
if
she
knew
what
was
in
this
letter
i
told
joyce
how
mean
she
acted
about
the
too
and
how
she
scowled
at
us
evah
since
we
came
betty
looked
up
with
a
preoccupied
smile
for
she
had
long
ago
finished
her
letter
to
eugenia
and
was
busy
with
some
verses
that
she
was
trying
to
write
about
the
rain
the
rhymes
were
falling
into
place
almost
as
easily
and
musically
as
the
tinkling
down
the
eaves
and
her
face
was
flushed
with
the
pleasure
of
it
she
was
so
wrapped
up
in
her
own
thoughts
that
she
did
not
understand
what
lloyd
was
saying
and
smiled
a
reply
without
the
faintest
idea
of
what
it
was
that
she
proposed
to
do
lloyd
laid
down
her
pen
and
tiptoeing
across
the
narrow
passage
that
divided
betty
room
from
molly
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
she
had
thought
that
the
parlour
bedroom
was
queer
and
that
betty
room
was
pitifully
bare
and
common
but
such
cheerlessness
as
this
she
had
certainly
never
seen
before
and
scarcely
imagined
it
was
an
room
over
the
kitchen
with
such
a
low
sloping
ceiling
that
she
could
touch
it
with
her
hand
except
when
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
there
was
a
rough
unpainted
floor
a
cot
a
box
covered
with
newspaper
on
which
stood
a
tin
basin
and
a
some
nails
driven
along
the
wall
held
a
row
of
clothes
and
a
chair
with
both
rockers
broken
off
was
propped
against
the
wall
lloyd
looked
around
her
with
a
shiver
the
only
bright
spot
in
the
room
was
a
bunch
of
in
a
bottle
and
the
only
picture
a
page
torn
from
an
illustrated
newspaper
and
pinned
to
the
wall
wondering
what
kind
of
a
picture
such
a
creature
as
the
witch
would
choose
to
decorate
her
room
lloyd
walked
across
to
examine
it
it
was
the
front
page
from
an
old
the
date
caught
her
eye
first
december
and
then
she
found
herself
looking
into
a
room
still
more
pitiful
than
the
one
in
which
she
stood
for
the
pictured
room
was
part
of
an
old
new
york
tenement
and
sobbing
in
the
corner
was
a
ragged
little
waif
heartbroken
because
santa
claus
had
passed
her
by
and
she
had
found
an
empty
stocking
on
christmas
morning
lloyd
could
not
see
the
face
hidden
in
the
tattered
apron
which
the
disappointed
little
hands
held
up
she
could
not
hear
the
sobs
that
she
knew
were
shaking
the
thin
little
shoulders
but
she
felt
the
misery
of
the
scene
as
forcibly
as
if
the
real
child
stood
before
her
as
she
stood
and
looked
she
knew
that
if
all
the
troubles
and
disappointments
of
her
whole
life
could
be
put
together
they
would
be
as
only
a
drop
compared
to
the
grief
of
the
poor
little
creature
in
the
picture
oh
betty
she
called
come
heah
quick
i
want
to
show
you
something
the
distress
in
lloyd
voice
made
betty
hurry
across
the
passage
with
her
pen
in
her
hand
wondering
what
could
be
the
matter
look
exclaimed
lloyd
pointing
to
the
picture
how
can
molly
keep
such
a
thing
in
her
room
do
you
she
was
evah
like
that
enough
to
make
her
cry
every
time
she
looks
at
it
maybe
she
used
to
be
like
that
said
betty
examining
the
picture
carefully
and
maybe
she
keeps
it
here
to
remind
her
how
much
better
off
she
is
now
than
she
used
to
be
i
ca
see
that
her
room
is
much
nicer
said
lloyd
looking
around
with
an
expression
of
disgust
it
always
has
been
used
as
a
sort
of
storeroom
explained
betty
this
is
the
first
time
i
been
in
here
since
i
came
back
and
i
did
know
how
it
had
been
fixed
for
molly
cousin
hetty
has
any
time
or
money
to
spend
making
it
look
nice
besides
she
is
only
in
here
for
a
little
while
she
is
to
have
my
room
when
i
go
away
if
i
abroad
all
winter
and
with
joyce
next
summer
and
at
locust
going
to
school
the
year
after
as
godmother
has
planned
i
suppose
i
never
be
back
here
again
to
really
live
i
going
to
make
a
new
pincushion
and
a
cover
for
my
bureau
and
put
a
white
curtain
at
the
window
before
i
leave
maybe
it
will
look
as
fine
to
molly
as
my
white
and
gold
room
did
to
me
at
the
house
beautiful
it
is
any
wonder
she
feels
jealous
of
us
when
she
has
a
single
nice
thing
in
the
whole
world
maybe
i
ought
to
have
written
such
spiteful
things
about
her
to
joyce
said
lloyd
whose
heart
began
to
soften
and
whose
conscience
pricked
as
she
turned
again
to
the
picture
but
even
while
they
were
planning
the
changes
they
would
make
in
the
gable
room
for
molly
there
was
a
stealthy
step
on
the
stairs
and
molly
herself
stood
in
the
door
glaring
at
them
like
an
angry
tigress
how
you
she
cried
stamping
her
foot
in
a
furious
rage
how
dare
you
come
in
here
spying
on
me
and
making
fun
of
my
things
and
looking
at
my
picture
you
look
at
my
little
dot
when
she
is
so
miserable
you
put
eyes
on
her
again
with
a
white
angry
face
she
dashed
past
them
tore
the
picture
from
the
wall
and
with
it
held
tightly
against
her
threw
herself
face
downward
on
the
cot
we
were
not
spying
on
you
began
lloyd
indignantly
we
were
not
making
fun
of
your
things
i
know
better
get
out
of
this
room
both
of
you
this
minute
cried
molly
lifting
her
white
face
in
which
her
angry
eyes
burned
like
flames
then
she
buried
her
head
in
her
pillow
sobbing
bitterly
if
were
an
and
had
but
one
thing
in
the
world
you
would
want
to
come
on
that
way
puzzled
and
almost
frightened
at
such
an
outburst
the
girls
retreated
to
the
doorway
and
then
as
she
continued
to
storm
at
them
they
went
back
to
betty
room
they
could
hear
her
sobbing
even
with
the
door
shut
presently
betty
said
i
going
in
there
again
and
see
if
i
can
find
out
what
the
matter
i
am
an
orphan
too
and
maybe
i
can
coax
her
to
tell
me
when
she
knows
how
sorry
i
am
for
her
people
wondered
sometimes
at
betty
way
of
walking
into
their
hearts
but
sympathy
is
an
open
sesame
to
nearly
all
gates
and
sympathy
was
betty
unfailing
key
it
was
always
ready
in
her
loving
little
hand
presently
when
molly
wild
burst
of
angry
sobbing
had
subsided
somewhat
betty
ventured
back
to
her
lloyd
heard
a
low
murmuring
of
voices
first
betty
and
then
molly
as
one
little
orphan
poured
out
her
story
to
the
other
it
was
nearly
an
hour
before
betty
came
back
to
her
room
lloyd
had
written
another
letter
while
she
waited
and
now
sat
leaning
against
the
listening
to
the
monotonous
from
a
leaky
spout
above
the
window
well
what
was
it
she
asked
eagerly
as
betty
opened
the
door
oh
you
never
heard
anything
so
pitiful
exclaimed
betty
sitting
down
on
her
bed
and
drawing
her
feet
up
under
her
comfortably
before
she
began
it
is
just
like
a
story
in
a
book
molly
says
that
when
she
was
little
her
father
was
a
railroad
conductor
and
she
and
her
mother
and
grandmother
and
baby
sister
lived
in
a
little
house
at
the
edge
of
town
it
was
near
enough
the
railroad
track
for
them
to
wave
to
her
father
from
the
front
door
whenever
his
train
passed
he
could
come
home
only
once
a
week
she
and
dot
thought
he
was
the
best
father
anybody
ever
had
for
he
never
came
home
without
something
in
his
pockets
for
them
and
he
rode
them
around
on
his
shoulders
and
played
with
them
all
the
time
he
was
in
the
house
he
was
always
bringing
things
to
their
mother
too
a
pretty
cup
and
saucer
or
a
pot
of
flowers
or
something
to
wear
and
as
for
the
old
grandmother
she
spent
her
time
telling
the
neighbours
how
good
her
son
was
to
her
but
molly
says
one
summer
they
moved
away
from
the
house
by
the
railroad
track
and
took
a
smaller
one
in
town
where
there
was
any
garden
and
trees
and
where
there
was
even
any
grass
except
a
narrow
strip
in
the
front
yard
her
father
had
lost
his
place
as
a
conductor
and
was
out
of
work
for
a
long
time
by
and
by
they
sold
their
piano
and
the
carpets
and
the
nicest
chairs
then
they
moved
again
this
time
it
was
to
a
cottage
without
even
a
strip
of
grass
the
front
door
opened
out
on
the
pavement
and
there
was
no
place
for
them
to
play
except
on
the
streets
their
father
never
brought
anything
home
to
them
any
more
and
never
played
with
them
they
could
understand
what
made
him
so
cross
or
what
made
their
mother
cry
so
much
until
one
day
she
heard
some
of
their
neighbours
talking
she
and
dot
were
waiting
in
the
corner
grocery
for
a
loaf
of
bread
and
she
heard
one
woman
say
to
another
in
a
low
tone
are
jim
conner
children
poor
little
kids
my
man
says
he
used
to
be
one
of
the
best
conductors
on
the
road
but
he
lost
his
job
when
he
took
to
getting
drunk
every
saturday
night
he
going
now
fast
as
a
man
can
go
heaven
only
knows
what
become
of
his
family
if
he
put
on
the
brakes
soon
then
molly
knew
what
was
the
matter
and
she
did
make
her
mother
cry
by
asking
any
more
questions
when
they
moved
again
the
next
week
that
time
they
had
only
two
rooms
over
a
barber
shop
and
molly
mother
died
that
summer
then
her
father
drank
harder
than
ever
and
never
brought
any
money
home
and
by
fall
they
had
sold
nearly
everything
that
was
left
and
moved
into
one
room
in
an
old
up
two
flights
of
stairs
their
grandmother
had
to
go
away
every
morning
to
look
for
work
she
was
too
old
to
wash
or
she
might
have
had
plenty
to
do
sometimes
she
got
odd
jobs
of
cleaning
and
sometimes
she
made
buttonholes
for
a
pants
factory
it
took
nearly
all
the
money
she
could
make
to
pay
the
rent
of
that
room
and
often
and
often
molly
said
there
were
days
when
they
had
nothing
but
scraps
of
stale
bread
to
eat
sometimes
there
even
that
and
she
and
dot
would
be
so
cold
and
hungry
that
they
would
huddle
together
in
a
corner
and
cry
she
said
it
made
her
feel
so
awful
to
hear
poor
little
dot
sobbing
for
something
to
eat
that
she
would
have
gone
out
on
the
streets
and
begged
but
their
grandmother
always
locked
them
up
when
she
went
away
what
for
interrupted
lloyd
who
was
listening
with
breathless
attention
she
was
afraid
that
their
father
would
come
home
drunk
and
find
them
alone
he
did
live
with
them
any
more
but
several
times
before
she
began
locking
them
up
he
staggered
in
and
frightened
them
dreadfully
their
ragged
clothes
and
their
looks
seemed
to
make
him
furious
it
hurt
his
conscience
i
suppose
and
that
made
him
want
to
hurt
somebody
molly
says
he
beat
them
sometimes
till
the
neighbours
interfered
more
than
once
he
shut
them
up
in
a
dark
closet
trying
to
make
them
tell
where
their
grandmother
kept
her
money
they
tell
him
for
she
did
have
any
money
but
he
kept
them
shut
up
in
the
dark
hours
at
a
time
one
night
he
came
in
crosser
than
they
had
ever
seen
him
and
threw
things
around
dreadfully
he
struck
his
old
mother
in
the
face
beat
molly
and
threw
a
stick
of
wood
at
little
dot
it
just
missed
putting
out
her
right
eye
and
made
such
a
deep
cut
over
it
that
they
had
to
send
for
a
doctor
to
sew
it
up
he
said
she
would
carry
the
scar
all
her
life
and
he
could
not
see
how
the
blow
had
missed
killing
her
it
nearly
broke
the
old
grandmother
heart
she
sat
up
all
night
and
molly
says
she
remembers
that
time
like
a
dreadful
dream
half
the
time
the
old
woman
was
rocking
dot
in
her
arms
crying
over
her
and
half
the
time
she
was
walking
the
floor
molly
says
that
now
when
she
shuts
her
eyes
at
night
she
can
hear
her
saying
over
and
over
my
jimmy
my
jimmy
to
think
that
my
only
child
should
come
to
this
oh
my
jimmy
the
baby
boy
that
was
my
sunshine
how
can
it
be
that
become
the
sorrow
of
my
life
then
she
walk
up
and
down
the
room
as
if
she
were
crazy
calling
out
it
the
drink
that
did
it
it
the
drink
and
a
curse
be
on
everything
that
helps
to
bring
it
into
the
world
molly
says
that
she
looked
so
terrible
with
her
white
hair
streaming
over
her
shoulders
and
her
eyes
staring
that
she
hid
her
face
in
the
bedclothes
but
she
could
shut
out
the
words
she
shouted
them
so
loud
that
the
family
in
the
next
room
could
sleep
and
knocked
on
the
wall
for
her
to
stop
but
she
only
went
on
walking
and
wringing
her
hands
and
calling
curse
on
all
who
buy
and
all
who
brew
a
curse
on
every
distiller
on
every
on
every
man
who
has
so
much
as
a
finger
in
this
business
of
death
may
all
the
shame
and
the
sin
and
the
sorrow
they
have
sown
in
other
homes
be
reaped
a
hundredfold
in
their
own
i
suppose
it
made
such
a
strong
impression
on
molly
hearing
her
grandmother
take
on
so
terribly
that
she
remembered
every
word
and
will
as
long
as
she
lives
she
said
the
rain
poured
that
night
till
it
leaked
down
on
the
bed
and
she
and
dot
had
to
snuggle
up
together
at
the
foot
to
keep
dry
her
grandmother
walked
the
floor
till
daylight
the
neighbours
complained
of
her
and
said
that
her
troubles
had
unsettled
her
mind
and
that
she
would
have
to
be
sent
some
place
to
be
taken
care
of
all
she
could
talk
about
was
the
drink
that
had
ruined
her
jimmy
and
the
awful
things
she
prayed
would
happen
to
anybody
who
had
anything
to
do
with
making
or
selling
whiskey
she
could
work
any
longer
and
they
were
almost
starving
one
day
she
was
taken
to
the
almshouse
and
the
family
in
the
next
room
took
care
of
molly
and
dot
until
arrangements
could
be
made
to
send
them
to
an
orphan
asylum
it
was
hard
to
get
them
into
one
you
know
because
their
father
was
living
they
stayed
several
weeks
with
those
people
and
molly
helped
take
care
of
the
baby
for
she
was
a
big
girl
eleven
years
old
then
dot
was
seven
but
so
little
and
starved
that
she
looked
scarcely
half
that
old
she
could
do
much
to
help
but
they
sent
her
on
errands
sometimes
one
day
she
went
to
the
around
the
corner
and
never
came
molly
hunted
in
all
the
alleys
and
courtyards
for
her
until
some
one
brought
her
a
message
from
her
father
that
he
had
taken
dot
away
to
another
town
he
did
care
what
became
of
molly
he
said
she
had
been
saucy
to
him
but
no
orphan
asylum
should
have
his
baby
hide
her
where
she
would
be
found
in
a
hurry
molly
says
she
would
have
liked
it
at
the
asylum
if
dot
could
have
been
with
her
but
because
she
could
it
made
her
hate
everything
and
everybody
in
the
world
there
was
a
big
distillery
in
sight
of
her
window
she
could
see
the
roof
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
the
last
thing
at
night
many
a
time
before
she
got
out
of
bed
she
think
of
her
grandmother
words
and
repeat
them
just
like
it
was
her
prayers
she
think
drink
that
put
me
here
and
it
what
separated
me
from
dot
and
then
she
say
curse
on
those
who
sell
and
those
who
make
it
and
on
every
hand
that
helps
to
bring
it
into
the
world
amen
how
dreadful
exclaimed
the
little
colonel
with
a
shudder
she
is
as
bad
as
a
heathen
but
you
ca
wonder
at
it
said
betty
we
would
have
felt
the
same
way
in
her
place
suppose
it
was
your
papa
jack
that
had
been
made
a
drunkard
and
that
he
begin
to
be
mean
to
you
and
make
so
much
trouble
that
godmother
would
die
and
you
have
to
leave
the
house
beautiful
and
be
sent
to
an
asylum
and
all
on
account
of
the
saloons
would
hate
them
and
everything
that
helped
keep
them
going
lloyd
only
shivered
at
the
thought
without
answering
it
was
not
possible
for
her
to
suppose
such
a
horrible
thing
about
her
beloved
father
but
she
felt
the
justice
of
betty
view
while
she
was
at
the
asylum
continued
betty
some
one
sent
a
pile
of
old
magazines
and
among
them
she
found
the
picture
that
we
saw
she
says
that
it
looks
exactly
like
dot
and
that
is
the
way
she
used
to
stand
and
cry
sometimes
when
she
was
cold
and
hungry
and
there
anything
in
the
house
to
eat
it
makes
her
perfectly
miserable
whenever
she
looks
at
it
but
it
is
so
much
like
dot
that
she
ca
bear
to
give
it
up
now
you
see
why
she
did
like
us
it
did
seem
fair
to
her
that
we
should
have
so
much
to
make
us
happy
when
she
has
so
little
she
has
had
a
hard
enough
time
to
spoil
anybody
disposition
i
think
lloyd
was
in
tears
by
this
time
and
reaching
across
the
table
for
the
letter
she
had
written
about
the
witch
she
began
tearing
it
into
pieces
oh
if
i
only
known
she
said
i
never
would
have
written
those
things
about
her
i
write
another
one
this
afternoon
and
tell
joyce
all
about
her
is
she
still
crying
in
there
betty
no
she
stopped
before
i
left
i
told
her
we
would
all
try
to
find
her
little
sister
and
that
i
was
sure
godmother
could
do
it
even
if
everybody
else
failed
but
she
did
seem
to
think
that
there
was
much
hope
did
you
tell
her
about
fairchance
asked
lloyd
or
joyce
finding
jules
desiré
that
time
she
went
to
the
little
sisters
of
the
poor
no
said
betty
then
let
me
tell
her
cried
the
little
colonel
starting
up
eagerly
she
ran
on
into
molly
room
while
thoughtful
betty
slipped
to
offer
her
services
in
molly
place
that
she
might
listen
undisturbed
to
lloyd
tale
of
comfort
all
about
jonesy
and
his
brother
and
the
bear
who
had
found
a
fair
chance
to
begin
life
again
in
the
home
that
the
two
little
knights
built
for
them
in
their
efforts
to
right
the
wrong
and
follow
the
king
all
about
old
desiré
who
had
been
found
in
a
pauper
home
and
brought
back
to
her
own
again
through
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
on
christmas
day
in
the
morning
it
is
too
good
to
be
true
sighed
molly
when
lloyd
had
finished
it
might
happen
to
some
people
but
it
too
good
to
happen
to
me
it
sounds
like
something
out
of
a
most
of
the
things
in
had
to
happen
first
before
they
were
written
about
answered
the
little
colonel
you
got
so
many
friends
now
that
surely
some
of
them
will
be
able
to
do
something
to
find
her
presently
molly
looked
up
saying
in
a
hesitating
way
several
people
have
been
good
to
me
before
but
i
never
thought
about
them
doing
it
because
they
were
my
i
thought
they
treated
me
kindly
just
because
they
pitied
me
and
that
made
me
cross
lloyd
was
turning
the
little
ring
that
eugenia
had
given
her
around
on
her
finger
and
something
in
the
touch
of
the
little
lover
knot
of
gold
recalled
all
that
she
had
resolved
about
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
it
was
the
ring
that
made
her
say
gently
you
must
think
that
about
betty
and
me
we
be
your
really
truly
friends
just
as
we
are
joyce
and
eugenia
then
to
molly
great
surprise
the
little
colonel
pretty
face
leaned
over
hers
an
instant
and
she
felt
a
quick
kiss
on
her
forehead
she
lay
there
a
moment
longer
without
speaking
and
then
sat
up
a
bright
smile
flashing
across
her
face
somehow
the
whole
world
seems
different
she
cried
it
seems
so
queer
to
think
i
really
got
like
other
people
there
was
a
warm
glow
in
the
little
colonel
heart
when
she
went
back
to
betty
room
the
consciousness
that
she
had
carried
comfort
and
sunshine
into
another
life
brightened
the
rainy
day
until
it
no
longer
seemed
dark
and
dreary
that
comfortable
consciousness
was
still
with
her
in
the
afternoon
when
she
sat
down
to
write
another
letter
to
joyce
a
letter
not
filled
this
time
with
her
own
mishaps
and
misfortunes
but
so
full
of
sympathy
for
molly
troubles
that
no
one
who
read
it
could
fail
to
be
touched
and
interested
chapter

a
feast
of

bells
of
the
magic

is
a
birthday
feast
that
awakes
your
chiming
so
make
your
joy
and
now
if
the
little
princes
and
princesses
will
thrust
their
curious
fingers
into
the
steam
as
the
water
bubbles
again
it
will
take
them
far
away
from
the
cuckoo
nest
they
will
see
the
village
of
plainsville
kansas
and
the
little
brown
house
where
the
ware
family
lived
the
day
that
the
little
colonel
letter
reached
joyce
was
tenth
birthday
one
would
not
have
dreamed
that
there
was
a
party
of
ten
boys
in
the
parlour
that
bright
september
afternoon
for
the
shutters
were
closed
and
every
blind
tightly
drawn
jack
had
darkened
the
room
to
give
them
a
magic
lantern
exhibition
while
joyce
was
spreading
the
table
under
an
in
the
side
yard
mary
her
funny
little
braids
with
their
big
bows
of
blue
ribbon
continually
bobbing
over
her
shoulders
was
helping
to
carry
out
the
curious
dishes
from
the
house
that
had
taken
all
morning
to
prepare
there
was
never
much
money
to
spend
in
entertainments
in
the
little
brown
house
but
birthdays
never
passed
unheeded
love
can
always
find
some
way
to
keep
the
days
of
its
calendar
joyce
and
her
mother
had
planned
a
novel
supper
for
holland
and
his
friends
thinking
it
would
make
a
merry
feast
for
them
to
laugh
over
now
and
a
pleasant
memory
by
and
by
when
three
score
years
had
been
added
to
his
ten
looking
back
on
the
day
when
somebody
cared
that
it
was
his
birthday
and
celebrated
it
with
loving
forethought
would
kindle
a
glow
in
his
heart
no
matter
how
old
and
he
might
live
to
be
the
little
mother
could
not
take
much
time
from
her
sewing
but
she
suggested
and
helped
with
the
verses
and
came
out
when
the
table
was
nearly
ready
to
add
a
few
finishing
touches
a
feast
of
sails
joyce
called
it
saying
that
if
godmother
could
change
a
pumpkin
into
a
gilded
coach
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
not
transform
an
ordinary
luncheon
into
a
fleet
of
boats
for
a
boy
whose
greatest
ambition
was
to
be
a
naval
officer
and
who
was
always
talking
about
the
sea
these
were
the
invitations
printed
in
jack
best
style
and
decorated
by
joyce
with
a
little
sketch
of
a
ship
in
full
sail
please
come
hale
and
hearty
to
holland
ware
party
september
the
day
and
partake
in
a
bunch
of
a
queer
birthday
lunch
and
afterward
join
in
a
play
the
things
which
we
eat
will
be
boats
sour
and
sweet
with
maybe
an
entrée
of
whales
will
you
please
to
arrive
awhile
before
five
the
hour
that
this
sails
the
invitations
aroused
great
interest
among
all
holland
friends
and
every
boy
was
at
the
gate
long
before
the
appointed
hour
curious
to
see
the
boats
sour
and
sweet
that
could
be
eaten
but
even
holland
did
not
know
what
was
in
store
for
them
joyce
had
driven
him
out
of
the
kitchen
while
she
was
preparing
the
surprise
and
would
not
begin
to
set
the
table
until
jack
had
marshalled
every
boy
into
the
dark
parlour
and
begun
his
magic
lantern
show
the
baby
was
with
them
a
baby
no
longer
he
stoutly
declared
as
he
had
that
day
been
promoted
from
kilts
to
his
first
pair
of
trousers
and
he
insisted
on
being
called
henceforth
by
his
own
name
norman
as
he
and
jack
were
to
be
added
to
the
party
of
ten
the
table
was
set
for
twelve
it
was
a
gay
sight
when
everything
was
ready
from
the
mirror
lake
in
the
middle
on
which
a
dozen
toy
swans
were
afloat
arose
a
lighthouse
made
of
doughnuts
it
was
surmounted
by
a
little
lantern
from
which
floated
a
tiny
flag
at
one
end
of
the
table
a
huge
watermelon
cut
lengthwise
and
furnished
with
masts
and
sails
of
red
crêpe
paper
looked
like
a
brig
just
launched
at
the
other
end
rose
the
great
white
island
of
the
birthday
cake
with
its
ten
red
candles
all
down
the
sides
of
the
table
was
a
flutter
of
yellow
and
green
and
white
and
blue
sails
for
at
each
plate
was
a
little
fleet
sporting
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
it
had
been
an
interesting
task
to
make
the
dressed
eggs
into
canoes
to
cut
the
cheese
into
square
rafts
and
hollow
out
the
long
cucumber
pickles
into
skiffs
fitting
sails
or
pennons
to
each
broomstraw
mast
it
had
been
still
more
interesting
to
change
a
bag
of
big
fat
raisins
into
turtles
by
poking
five
cloves
and
a
bit
of
stem
into
each
one
for
the
head
legs
and
tail
joyce
took
an
artistic
pleasure
in
arranging
the
orange
boats
around
the
table
she
had
made
them
by
cutting
an
orange
in
two
and
putting
a
stick
of
peppermint
candy
in
each
half
for
a
mast
and
they
had
a
foreign
chinese
look
with
their
queer
sails
flaming
with
little
dragons
jack
had
drawn
them
here
and
there
over
the
sea
of
white
tablecloth
she
had
scattered
candy
fish
and
the
raisin
turtles
at
the
last
moment
there
were
potato
chips
to
be
heated
and
islands
of
sandwiches
and
jelly
to
distribute
and
the
can
of
sardines
to
open
mary
had
insisted
on
having
the
sardines
to
personate
whales
and
she
herself
served
one
to
each
guest
on
a
little
plate
belonging
to
her
set
of
doll
dishes
it
had
taken
so
long
to
prepare
all
these
boats
that
joyce
had
had
no
time
to
decorate
the
menu
cards
as
she
had
planned
but
jack
had
cut
them
in
the
shape
of
an
anchor
and
stuck
a
through
each
one
for
a
souvenir
this
was
what
was
printed
on
them
menu
an
egg
canoe
a
skiff
of
pickle
a
cheese
raft
too
your
taste
to
tickle
turtles
galore
entrée
of

found
alongshore
a
la
sardine
tails
chips
in
a
pile
and
a
sandwich
island
the
brig
an
orange
boat
last
with
sails
all
with
a
candy
mast
the
island
of
cake
with
fish
from
sweet
lake
mary
gave
the
signal
when
everything
was
ready
a
long
toot
on
an
old
tin
whistle
that
sounded
like
a
she
blew
it
through
the
keyhole
of
the
parlour
door
expecting
a
speedy
answer
but
was
not
prepared
for
the
sensation
her
summons
created
the
door
flew
open
so
suddenly
that
she
was
nearly
taken
off
her
feet
and
the
boys
fell
all
over
each
other
in
their
race
for
the
table
when
they
were
all
seated
norman
standing
up
at
the
foot
of
the
table
repeated
the
rhyme
which
joyce
had
carefully
taught
him
heave
ho
my
hearties
let
these
boats
sail
down
the
red
sea
of
your
throats
they
surely
obeying
orders
said
mary
mournfully
a
few
minutes
later
when
she
hurried
into
the
kitchen
for
another
sandwich
island
they
swallowing
up
those
boats
the
real
red
sea
swallowed
up
old
pharaoh
and
all
his
chariots
there
be
nothing
left
for
us
but
the
rinds
and
the
oh
yes
there
will
said
joyce
cheerfully
opening
the
pantry
door
and
showing
her
three
plates
on
the
lower
shelf
there
is
our
supper
i
put
it
aside
for
boys
are
like
grasshoppers
they
eat
everything
in
sight
i
did
take
time
to
put
sails
in
my
boats
or
in
mother
but
you
got
one
of
every
kind
just
like
the
boys
even
to
a
with
a
in
it
there
was
a
broad
smile
on
mary
beaming
little
face
as
she
surveyed
her
part
of
the
feast
and
popping
one
of
the
fat
into
her
mouth
she
hurried
back
to
her
duties
as
waitress
joyce
followed
to
pass
around
the
birthday
cake
telling
each
boy
to
blow
out
a
candle
as
he
took
a
slice
and
to
make
a
birthday
wish
just
as
she
finished
there
was
a
click
of
the
and
one
of
her
schoolmates
came
up
the
path
it
was
grace
link
one
of
her
best
friends
yet
joyce
wished
she
had
not
happened
in
at
that
particular
time
grace
had
a
way
of
looking
around
her
with
a
very
superior
air
it
may
have
been
due
to
her
effort
to
keep
her
in
position
but
joyce
found
it
irritating
at
times
the
glances
made
her
feel
how
shabby
the
little
brown
house
must
look
in
comparison
to
the
links
elegant
home
and
she
resented
grace
apparent
notice
of
the
fact
in
just
a
minute
grace
she
called
thinking
she
would
pass
the
cake
around
once
more
and
leave
the
boys
to
finish
quietly
by
themselves
but
she
did
not
have
a
chance
to
do
that
with
a
whoop
as
of
one
voice
each
boy
started
up
grabbing
another
slice
of
cake
in
one
hand
as
he
passed
the
plate
and
all
the
candy
fish
he
could
scoop
up
with
the
other
and
was
off
for
a
noisy
game
of
in
the
back
yard
my
gracious
what
a
noisy
lot
exclaimed
grace
recognising
her
own
small
brother
among
them
and
making
mental
note
of
a
lecture
she
meant
to
give
him
after
awhile
oh
you
ought
to
have
seen
how
beautiful
everything
looked
when
they
sat
down
cried
mary
noticing
grace
critical
glances
as
she
surveyed
the
wreck
they
had
made
of
the
table
they
eaten
up
the
lighthouse
all
but
the
lantern
and
the
flag
and
the
watermelon
ship
was
pretty
here
what
the
little
boats
looked
like
she
dashed
into
the
pantry
for
her
own
gay
little
fleet
of
egg
and
orange
and
pickle
boats
with
their
sails
how
cunning
said
grace
looking
admiringly
from
the
boats
to
the
row
of
but
what
a
lot
of
time
and
trouble
you
all
must
have
taken
for
those
kids
do
you
think
boys
appreciate
it
i
do
my
brothers
do
said
joyce
stoutly
we
ca
afford
to
have
ices
and
fine
things
from
the
confectioner
so
we
have
to
think
up
all
sorts
of
odd
surprises
to
take
their
place
mother
began
it
long
ago
when
jack
and
i
were
little
and
she
gave
us
our
first
valentine
tea
she
said
it
was
no
more
trouble
to
cut
the
cookies
and
sandwiches
than
to
make
them
round
and
it
took
very
little
time
to
decorate
the
table
to
look
like
a
valentine
but
it

mary
called
out
triumphantly
after
them
as
the
two
girls
walked
slowly
toward
the
house
that
makes
fifteen
ca
you
go
over
to
elsie
somers
with

at
the
centrepiece
she

joyce
sitting
wearily
down
on
the
doorstep
and
making
room
for
grace
beside
her
there
all
that
mess
to
clean
up
and
the
boys
will
be
coming
in
soon
when
it
begins
to
get
dark
for
their
bonfire
stories
do
you
see
that
enormous
pile
of
leaves
over
there
we
going
to
have
a
jolly
big
bonfire
after
awhile
and
sit
around
it
telling
stories
that
is
holland
idea
and
part
of
our
way
of
keeping
birthdays
is
to
let
the
one
who
celebrates
choose
what
he
would
like
to
do
bum
here
i
come
shouted
several
voices
from
the
stable
roof
and
alley
fence
and
jack
repeated
it
at
the
top
of
his
voice
as
he
dashed
around
the
corner
of
the
house
here
joyce
he
cried
pitching
a
letter
toward
her
it
came
in
the
last
mail
and
i
forgot
to
give
it
to
you
when
i
came
back
from
the
just
thought
of
it
and
off
he
went
again
it
is
from
the
little
colonel
said
joyce
in
a
pleased
tone
you
want
to
hear
it
grace
who
had
heard
so
much
about
the
happenings
at
the
house
party
that
she
almost
felt
as
if
she
had
been
one
of
the
guests
promptly
settled
herself
to
listen
and
at
joyce
call
ware
who
was
still
stitching
beside
the
window
laid
down
her
sewing
and
came
out
to
be
part
of
the
interested
audience
oh
goody
betty
has
written
too
said
joyce
as
she
unfolded
the
closely
written
pages
i
wondered
so
often
what
lloyd
would
think
of
life
at
the
cuckoo
nest
and
if
it
would
seem
the
same
to
betty
after
her
visit
at
locust
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
little
colonel
experience
in
either
letter
not
a
word
about
aunt
jane
illness
or
the
game
of
or
the
accident
they
had
just
come
from
listening
to
molly
pitiful
story
and
both
letters
were
full
of
it
the
gift
that
was
to
make
betty
famous
in
after
years
showed
in
the
pathetic
little
tale
she
wrote
joyce
and
so
real
did
she
make
the
scene
that
joyce
could
scarcely
keep
a
tremble
out
of
her
voice
as
she
read
it
aloud
would
you
love
to
see
the
picture
that
looks
so
much
like
little
lost
sister
asked
mary
drawing
a
deep
breath
when
the
letter
was
done
maybe
we
got
it
at
home
said
grace
eagerly
we
taken
the
for
years
and
there
is
a
pile
of
them
in
the
attic
some
of
them
have
been
lost
or
torn
up
but
if
i
can
find
the
picture
i
bring
it
over
what
did
betty
say
is
the
date
of
that
number
illustration
the
picture
passed
around
the
circle
december
said
joyce
referring
to
the
letter
well
as
you
ca
go
over
to
elsie
with
me
now
i
wait
till
some
other
time
i
go
home
now
and
look
for
that
picture
before
dark
come
back
in
time
for
the
bonfire
said
joyce
cordially
we
have
some
fine
stories
ready
all
right
responded
grace
i
love
to
in
the
meantime
we
clear
away
the
wreck
and
eat
our
supper
said
joyce
as
grace
went
down
the
path
and
mary
followed
the
little
mother
into
the
pantry
they
had
just
hung
up
the
last
tea
towel
and
called
jack
to
light
the
bonfire
when
grace
came
back
she
had
the
picture
with
her
and
they
looked
long
and
earnestly
at
the
little
bunch
of
misery
sobbing
in
the
corner
what
if
dot
father
has
brought
her
out
west
exclaimed
mary
impulsively
as
she
continued
to
gaze
at
the
forlorn
little
figure
what
if
she
should
come
to
our
house
begging
some
day
and
we
should
find
her
would
it
be
grand
and
would
molly
and
the
girls
be
glad
illustration
the
picture
passed
around
the
circle
it
makes
me
want
to
cry
said
joyce
if
i
were
rich
i
go
out
and
hunt
for
all
the
poor
little
children
like
this
that
i
could
find
and
do
something
to
make
them
happy
surely
somebody
of
all
the
thousands
who
have
seen
that
picture
must
have
been
moved
to
pity
by
it
no
telling
how
much
good
that
artist
has
done
by
making
people
see
some
of
the
misery
in
the
world
that
they
can
help
that
is
the
kind
of
an
artist
i
hope
to
be
some
day
there
were
many
stories
told
that
evening
around
the
birthday
bonfire
which
jack
kept
ablaze
not
only
with
leaves
but
with
pine
cones
and
hickory
knots
giants
and
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
indians
and
burglars
and
wild
beasts
took
their
turns
in
the
thrilling
tales
but
none
made
such
a
profound
impression
as
the
story
of
molly
little
lost
sister
who
perhaps
at
that
very
moment
was
locked
in
a
dark
closet
by
a
drunken
father
or
sobbing
herself
to
sleep
bruised
and
hungry
for
one
reason
it
was
real
and
for
another
the
picture
passed
around
the
circle
in
the
light
of
the
glowing
bonfire
appealed
to
every
child
heart
there
i
wish
the
giant
scissors
were
real
said
holland
referring
to
his
favourite
tale
they
find
her
joyce
what
would
you
have
to
say
to
them
to
make
them
go
in
search
giant
scissors
rise
in
power
find
little
dot
this
very
hour
and
then
they
would
go
rushing
away
over
mountains
and
dales
continued
joyce
who
knew
how
greatly
holland
enjoyed
these
variations
of
his
favourite
story
through
streets
and
through
alleys
they
go
through
mansions
and
tenements
until
they
found
her
and
brought
her
back
to
molly
then
hand
in
hand
the
big
sister
and
the
little
one
would
follow
the
scissors
back
to
the
home
of
ethelred
because
like
him
the
only
kingdom
that
they
crave
is
the
kingdom
of
a
loving
heart
and
a
happy
fireside
there
would
be
feasting
and
merrymaking
for
seventy
days
and
seventy
nights
with
the
scissors
keeping
guard
at
the
portal
of
ethelred
so
that
only
those
who
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
loving
hearts
and
gentle
hands
might
enter
in
strangely
moved
by
the
story
little
norman
got
up
from
his
seat
and
ran
to
joyce
burying
his
head
in
her
lap
i
hope
i
never
be
losted
from
big
sister
he
cried
his
voice
quivering
despite
the
fact
that
he
no
longer
wore
kilts
me
too
said
holland
sliding
along
the
bench
a
little
closer
to
her
fellows
that
have
got
any
sisters
to
get
up
birthday
parties
for
and
everything
do
know
what
they
miss
joyce
looked
over
at
grace
with
a
smile
that
seemed
to
say
what
did
i
tell
you
these
kids
as
you
call
them
do
appreciate
what
their
sisters
do
for
them
long
after
the
bonfire
was
out
and
the
birthday
guests
had
departed
holland
turned
restlessly
on
his
pillow
the
many
boats
he
had
eaten
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
his
restlessness
but
the
thought
of
the
lonely
little
child
for
whom
molly
was
grieving
was
still
in
his
mind
when
his
mother
looked
in
an
hour
later
to
see
if
all
was
well
for
the
night
i
thankful
for
the
party
he
announced
unexpectedly
as
she
bent
over
him
and
i
thankful
for
most
everything
i
can
think
of
but
most
thankfullest
because
we
are
any
of
us
in
this
house
lost
from
each
other
please
god
you
may
say
that
on
all
your
birthdays
whispered
his
mother
kissing
him
then
she
went
away
with
the
light
and
silence
reigned
in
the
little
brown
house

had
just
brought
her
a
letter
and
she
was
reading
it
aloud
to
her
maid
patient
old
eliot
had
taken
such
a
deep
interest
in
all
that
belonged
to
lloydsboro
valley
since
their
journey
to
locust
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
confide
in
her
even
if
eugenia
had
had
any
one
else
to
confide
in
she
could
have
found
no
one
who
had
her
interest
at
heart
more
than
this
sensible
elderly
woman
who
had
taken
care
of
her
for
so
many
years
eugenia
had
not
gone
back
to
as
a
regular
pupil
it
had
scarcely
seemed
worth
while
since
she
was
to
leave
so
soon
for
her
trip
abroad
but
riverdale
seminary
being
in
the
suburbs
was
not
such
a
great
distance
from
the
hotel
but
that
she
could
go
out
every
morning
for
her
french
lesson
knowing
that
she
would
soon
have
practical
use
for
the
language
she
was
doing
extra
work
in
french
and
taking
a
greater
interest
in
it
than
she
had
ever
shown
before
in
any
study
if
the
three
girls
who
had
been
her
devoted
friends
the
year
before
had
come
back
to
riverdale
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
she
would
have
insisted
on
taking
her
place
in
the
as
a
regular
pupil
in
order
to
be
with
them
as
long
as
possible
but
the
summer
vacation
had
brought
many
changes
the
day
that
eugenia
reached
new
york
on
her
return
from
the
house
party
a
letter
had
come
saying
that
molly
blythe
would
never
be
back
at
the
school
there
had
been
an
accident
on
the
mountain
where
she
had
gone
to
spend
the
summer
with
her
family
a
runaway
team
a
wild
dash
down
the
mountainside
and
the
merry
picnic
had
ended
in
a
sad
accident
she
was
lying
now
in
a
long
serious
illness
that
would
either
leave
her
a
cripple
for
life
or
take
her
away
in
a
little
while
from
the
devoted
family
that
was
nearly
distracted
by
the
thought
of
losing
her
kell
still
in
the
bermudas
was
not
coming
back
to
school
until
after
christmas
and
fay
while
she
still
called
eugenia
her
dearest
divided
her
affections
with
a
blonde
girl
from
ohio
they
had
passed
the
summer
on
the
same
island
in
the
lawrence
and
eugenia
felt
that
her
place
was
taken
by
this
stranger
with
molly
and
kell
away
and
fay
so
changed
eugenia
would
have
lost
all
interest
in
the
school
had
it
not
been
that
she
wanted
to
acquire
as
much
french
as
possible
before
going
abroad
in
most
things
she
was
not
so
overbearing
and
thoughtless
in
her
treatment
of
poor
old
eliot
since
her
visit
to
locust
the
ring
she
wore
was
a
daily
reminder
of
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
that
she
was
trying
to
leave
behind
her
in
everybody
memory
but
eliot
still
found
her
patience
sorely
tried
at
times
missing
the
girls
at
school
eugenia
was
lonely
and
wished
a
hundred
times
a
day
that
she
were
back
at
the
house
party
sometimes
she
grumbled
and
moped
until
the
atmosphere
around
her
was
as
gloomy
and
depressing
as
a
london
fog
nothing
to
do
is
a
dreadful
complaint
eliot
had
said
a
few
moments
before
the
boy
brought
up
the
letter
you
break
one
of
the
commandments
every
day
you
live
miss
eugenia
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
demanded
eugenia
indignantly
i
lie
or
steal
or
murder
or
do
any
of
those
things
it
says
not
to
it
is
any
of
the
shalt
nots
said
eliot
determined
to
speak
her
mind
now
that
she
had
started
it
is
a
days
shalt
thou
labour
and
do
all
thy
work
it
is
plain
talk
miss
eugenia
but
there
nobody
else
to
say
it
and
i
feel
that
it
ought
to
be
said
more
than
of
your
life
you
are
miserable
because
you
are
doing
nothing
but
grumbling
and
trying
to
kill
time
you
need
be
unhappy
at
all
if
you
look
around
you
and
see
some
of
the
world
work
lying
around
waiting
for
just
such
hands
as
yours
to
take
hold
of
it
oh
do
be
so
preachy
pouted
eugenia
impatiently
it
was
just
at
this
point
that
the
little
colonel
letter
was
brought
in
and
the
sight
of
the
familiar
handwriting
made
eugenia
face
brighten
as
if
by
magic
one
from
betty
too
she
cried
as
a
second
closely
written
sheet
dropped
into
her
lap
then
forgetting
her
impatience
with
preaching
she
began
reading
aloud
the
news
from
the
cuckoo
nest
it
was
the
same
pathetic
little
tale
that
had
touched
the
hearts
of
the
birthday
banqueters
circled
around
the
glowing
bonfire
and
it
moved
eugenia
to
pity
just
as
it
had
moved
all
who
listened
at
the
little
brown
house
eugenia
folded
up
the
letters
and
slipped
them
back
into
the
envelope
if
i
were
down
there
at
the
cuckoo
nest
with
lloyd
and
betty
there
would
be
something
for
me
to
do
i
find
molly
sister
even
if
i
had
to
spend
all
my
year
allowance
to
employ
a
detective
poor
lonesome
little
thing
i
taken
a
fancy
to
that
girl
maybe
it
is
on
account
of
her
name
being
the
same
as
molly
blythe
even
for
no
other
reason
than
that
i
would
be
glad
to
help
her
you
do
have
to
go
travelling
to
find
lonely
people
miss
eugenia
said
eliot
who
seemed
to
have
much
on
her
mind
that
afternoon
and
a
determination
to
share
it
with
eugenia
all
the
aching
hearts
belong
to
little
orphans
and
some
of
the
loneliest
people
in
the
world
touch
elbows
with
you
every
day
who
for
instance
demanded
eugenia
unbelievingly
i
never
saw
them
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
sprang
up
and
glanced
into
the
mirror
and
gave
a
few
hasty
touches
to
her
hair
and
belt
bring
me
my
hat
eliot
and
get
into
your
bonnet
i
going
out
to
riverdale
i
sure
i
can
find
the
picture
they
wrote
about
somewhere
in
the
seminary
library
they
always
save
the
old
files
of
illustrated
papers
i
wild
to
see
what
that
picture
looks
like
that
molly
made
such
a
fuss
about
and
it
will
give
me
some
amusement
for
the
afternoon
little
miss
gray
the
librarian
at
the
riverdale
seminary
looked
up
in
surprise
when
eugenia
came
rustling
into
the
an
hour
later
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
in
that
term
it
was
a
and
up
to
that
time
no
one
had
come
in
all
the
afternoon
sitting
by
the
window
cataloguing
new
books
miss
gray
had
looked
out
from
time
to
time
wishing
that
she
too
could
have
a
and
that
she
could
change
places
with
some
of
the
schoolgirls
outside
on
the
campus
she
could
see
them
strolling
along
the
shady
avenues
by
twos
and
threes
and
fours
never
one
alone
the
sight
made
her
feel
even
more
lonely
than
usual
she
looked
up
eagerly
at
the
sound
of
the
approaching
footsteps
glad
of
any
companionship
but
shrank
back
timidly
when
she
saw
who
was
rustling
toward
her
eugenia
had
always
had
such
a
supercilious
air
in
asking
for
a
book
that
she
disliked
to
wait
on
her
but
eugenia
came
forward
so
intent
on
her
errand
that
she
forgot
to
be
haughty
and
asked
for
the
old
volume
of
as
eagerly
as
a
little
girl
asking
for
a
that
the
date
she
said
handing
miss
gray
a
slip
of
paper
oh
i
do
hope
you
have
it
you
see
the
girls
wrote
such
an
interesting
account
of
the
little
waif
that
i
anxious
to
have
the
picture
it
will
be
so
nice
to
know
that
i
looking
at
the
same
thing
they
saw
in
room
what
a
little
morsel
of
misery
she
exclaimed
as
miss
gray
opened
the
volume
is
it
pitiful
i
never
would
have
imagined
that
a
real
child
could
be
so
forlorn
and
miserable
as
this
if
the
girls
had
written
about
it
i
thought
such
tales
were
made
up
by
newspapers
and
magazines
just
for
something
to
write
about
before
she
realised
that
she
was
taking
the
little
librarian
into
her
confidence
she
was
pouring
out
the
story
of
molly
and
dot
as
if
she
were
talking
to
one
of
the
girls
when
she
finished
miss
gray
turned
her
head
away
but
eugenia
saw
two
tears
splash
down
on
the
table
excuse
my
taking
it
so
much
to
heart
said
miss
gray
with
a
smile
as
she
wiped
away
the
drops
but
it
seems
so
real
to
me
that
i
could
help
it
i
like
the
little
lost
sister
you
know
not
ragged
and
torn
and
like
the
waif
in
the
picture
for
this
position
gives
me
all
the
comforts
of
life
but
i
just
as
much
alone
in
the
world
as
she
when
i
am
busy
i
never
think
of
it
but
sometimes
the
thought
sweeps
over
me
like
a
great
overwhelming
wave
i
all
alone
in
this
big
strange
city
only
a
drop
in
the
bucket
with
nobody
to
care
whether
i
fare
ill
or
well
eugenia
did
not
know
how
to
answer
she
thought
this
must
be
one
of
the
people
whom
eliot
meant
who
touched
elbows
with
her
every
day
stirred
by
a
great
pity
and
a
desire
to
comfort
this
little
woman
whose
big
blue
eyes
were
as
appealing
as
a
baby
and
whose
voice
was
as
mournful
as
a
dove
eugenia
stood
a
moment
in
awkward
silence
she
wished
that
betty
could
be
there
to
say
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
as
she
always
did
or
that
better
still
she
had
betty
way
of
comforting
people
then
a
thought
came
to
her
like
an
inspiration
oh
miss
gray
maybe
if
you
have
so
much
sympathy
for
the
little
lost
child
you
take
an
interest
in
helping
me
find
her
nobody
knows
where
her
father
took
her
he
sent
word
that
he
had
left
louisville
and
there
is
no
telling
where
he
has
drifted
they
are
as
likely
to
be
here
in
new
york
as
anywhere
maybe
if
we
went
around
to
all
the
orphanages
and
hospitals
and
free
kindergartens
we
could
find
some
trace
of
her
papa
wo
let
me
go
out
in
the
city
alone
and
eliot
is
such
a
stick
about
going
to
strange
places
she
always
loses
her
head
and
gets
flustered
and
makes
a
mess
of
everything
oh
you
mind
going
any
day
after
four
exclaimed
miss
gray
eagerly
and
on
wednesdays
the
library
closes
at
one
we
begin
next
wednesday
said
eugenia
come
and
take
lunch
with
me
at
the
waldorf
and
we
can
get
an
early
start
oh
i
be
so
much
obliged
to
you
before
miss
gray
could
say
anything
more
she
had
rustled
out
into
the
hall
where
eliot
sat
waiting
the
little
librarian
was
left
to
clasp
her
hands
in
silent
delight
over
the
thought
of
such
a
lark
as
a
lunch
at
the
waldorf
and
an
afternoon
outing
with
the
wealthiest
and
most
exclusive
girl
in
the
seminary
we
are
on
the
track
too
wrote
eugenia
to
betty
some
time
after
miss
gray
and
i
are
playing
private
detective
on
the
trail
of
little
dot
we
have
found
any
trace
of
her
yet
but
we
haunting
all
sorts
of
places
where
we
think
there
is
any
prospect
of
coming
across
her
we
have
found
plenty
of
other
children
who
need
help
and
papa
gave
me
a
big
check
last
night
to
use
for
a
little
cripple
that
we
became
interested
in
miss
gray
is
lovely
we
been
to
several
things
together
a
matinee
and
a
concert
and
an
art
exhibition
i
showed
her
my
ring
the
day
she
was
here
to
lunch
and
told
her
all
about
the
time
when
you
were
blind
and
what
you
said
to
me
about
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
and
she
said
that
blessed
little
betty
that
she
has
given
me
an
inspiration
for
life
instead
of
thinking
of
my
own
loneliness
i
shall
begin
to
think
more
of
other
people
and
to
leave
a
memory
behind
me
too
as
enduring
as
tusitala
one
other
person
took
the
trouble
to
hunt
up
an
old
file
of
papers
and
find
the
picture
like
the
one
pinned
on
molly
wall
that
was
sherman
the
morning
that
lloyd
letter
came
she
happened
to
be
passing
the
city
library
and
went
in
to
ask
for
it
the
sight
of
the
poor
little
creature
haunted
her
all
morning
and
remembering
sullen
face
she
longed
to
do
something
to
give
it
a
happier
expression
that
afternoon
she
went
down
to
an
art
store
to
choose
a
picture
for
lloyd
to
hang
in
molly
room
beside
the
pitiful
little
newspaper
clipping
it
was
a
picture
of
the
good
shepherd
carrying
in
his
arms
a
little
stray
lamb
that
had
wandered
away
from
the
shelter
of
the
sheepfold
chapter
ix
left
behind
every
evening
for
a
week
at
the
cuckoo
nest
a
fire
had
been
kindled
on
the
hearth
for
the
autumn
rains
made
the
nights
chilly
here
until
eight
the
boys
could
play
any
game
they
chose
left
chalk
marks
on
the
new
rag
carpet
and
tag
upset
the
furniture
as
if
a
cyclone
had
swept
through
the
room
but
never
a
word
of
reproof
interrupted
their
sport
no
matter
how
boisterous
lloyd
wondered
sometimes
that
the
roof
did
not
tumble
in
around
their
ears
when
she
and
betty
and
molly
joined
the
five
boys
in
a
game
of
blind
man
buff
it
is
nice
to
have
old
furniture
and
stout
rag
carpets
she
confided
to
betty
in
a
breathless
pause
of
the
game
we
could
romp
in
the
house
this
way
at
locust
i
like
the
place
now
it
does
seem
a
bit
queah
i
would
care
if
mothah
would
write
for
us
to
stay
heah
anothah
week
but
the
summons
to
leave
came
next
day
a
howl
went
up
from
all
the
little
appletons
as
the
letter
was
read
aloud
it
had
been
the
most
exciting
week
of
their
lives
for
betty
and
the
little
colonel
were
on
the
friendliest
terms
with
molly
and
the
three
together
introduced
new
games
into
the
cuckoo
nest
with
an
enthusiasm
that
made
the
evening
playtime
a
delight
the
charades
and
tableaux
and
private
theatricals
were
something
to
enjoy
with
keen
zest
at
the
moment
and
dream
of
for
weeks
afterward
we
will
have
one
more
jolly
old
evening
together
anyhow
said
bradley
i
go
out
and
get
the
firewood
now
but
when
supper
was
over
and
the
two
trunks
stood
in
a
corner
packed
and
strapped
for
their
morrow
journey
nobody
seemed
in
a
mood
for
romping
the
boys
squatted
on
the
as
solemnly
as
indians
around
a
as
the
shadows
danced
on
the
ceiling
betty
reached
down
from
the
low
stool
where
she
sat
to
stroke
the
puppy
stretched
across
her
feet
what
do
you
all
want
me
to
bring
you
from
europe
she
asked
playfully
pretend
that
i
could
bring
you
anything
you
wanted
only
remember
the
story
of
beauty
and
the
beast
and
do
anybody
ask
for
a
white
rose
molly
you
are
the
oldest
you
begin
and
choose
first
molly
gray
eyes
gazed
wistfully
into
the
embers
oh
you
know
that
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
whole
world
that
i
ever
wish
for
and
that
is
dot
but
of
course
she
is
in
europe
you
do
know
interrupted
lloyd
i
read
of
stranger
things
than
that
i
have
a
story
at
home
about
a
boy
that
was
kidnapped
and
yeahs
aftah
he
was
found
strollin
around
in
a
foreign
country
with
a
band
of
gypsies
they
taken
him
across
the
ocean
with
them
and
there
a
piece
in
my
fourth
reader
added
scott
eagerly
about
a
child
that
was
stolen
by
indians
when
she
was
so
young
that
she
soon
forgot
how
to
talk
english
she
grew
up
to
look
just
like
a
squaw
when
the
tribe
was
captured
her
own
mother
did
not
recognise
her
her
mother
was
an
old
woman
then
but
there
was
a
queer
kind
of
scar
that
had
always
been
on
the
girl
arm
and
when
her
mother
saw
that
she
knew
it
was
her
daughter
and
she
began
to
sing
a
song
that
she
used
to
sing
when
she
rocked
her
children
to
sleep
and
the
girl
remembered
it
and
it
seemed
to
bring
back
all
the
other
things
she
had
forgotten
and
she
ran
up
to
her
mother
and
put
her
arms
around
her
dot
has
a
scar
said
molly
i
could
tell
her
anywhere
by
that
mark
over
her
eye
where
the
stick
of
wood
hit
her
betty
should
find
her
somewhere
abroad
said
lloyd
her
eyes
shining
like
stars
at
the
thought
they
be
driving
along
in
paris
and
a
little
flower
girl
would
come
up
with
a
basket
of
violets
and
eugenia
would
say
papa
please
stop
the
carriage
i
want
some
of
those
violets
and
while
they
were
buying
them
betty
would
talk
to
the
little
flower
girl
and
find
out
that
she
was
dot
of
cousin
carl
would
take
her
right
into
the
carriage
and
they
whirl
away
to
the
hotel
and
aftah
they
bought
her
a
lot
of
pretty
clothes
take
her
travellin
with
them
and
finally
bring
her
back
to
america
just
as
if
it
were
in
a
fairy
tale
or
eugenia
might
find
her
in
new
york
before
we
leave
suggested
betty
you
know
she
wrote
that
she
is
hunting
and
that
her
father
promised
to
ask
the
police
force
to
look
too
joyce
is
lookin
too
said
lloyd
dot
is
as
apt
to
wandah
west
as
east
there
so
many
people
interested
now
in
tryin
to
find
her
i
do
wondah
who
be
the
one
godmother
most
likely
said
betty
would
it
be
lovely
if
she
should
suppose
she
find
her
about
christmas
time
and
she
send
word
to
molly
to
hang
up
two
stockings
because
she
was
going
to
send
her
a
present
so
big
that
it
would
go
into
one
and
christmas
morning
molly
would
run
down
here
to
the
chimney
where
she
hung
them
and
there
would
be
dot
standing
in
her
stockings
oh
said
molly
imploringly
with
a
little
choke
in
her
voice
you
make
it
seem
so
real
that
i
ca
bear
to
talk
about
it
any
more
there
was
silence
in
the
room
for
a
little
space
and
only
the
shadows
moved
as
the
flames
leaped
and
flickered
on
the
old
hearthstone
then
lloyd
leaning
forward
took
hold
of
one
of
betty
long
brown
curls
tell
us
a
story
tusitala
she
said
coaxingly
it
will
be
the
last
one
before
we
go
away
why
did
you
call
her
that
asked
the
inquisitive
bradley
tusitala
oh
that
means
you
know
that
is
the
name
the
samoan
chiefs
gave
to
robert
louis
stevenson
when
he
went
to
live
on
their
island
and
that
is
the
name
we
gave
betty
when
we
thought
she
was
going
blind
the
time
we
all
had
the
measles
why
asked
bradley
again
because
mothah
said
betty
writes
stories
so
well
now
that
she
will
be
known
as
the
children
tusitala
some
day
besides
she
told
us
the
tale
about
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
and
eugenia
gave
us
each
a
ring
to
help
us
remembah
it
see
they
are
just
alike
she
laid
her
hand
against
betty
a
moment
to
compare
the
little
twists
of
gold
each
tied
in
a
lover
knot
and
then
slipped
hers
off
passing
it
around
the
circle
that
each
might
see
the
name
tusitala
engraved
inside
tell
them
about
it
betty
she
insisted
there
is
much
to
tell
began
betty
clasping
her
hands
around
her
knees
only
stevenson
was
so
good
to
those
poor
old
samoan
chiefs
visiting
them
when
they
were
put
in
prison
and
treating
them
so
kindly
in
every
way
he
could
think
of
that
they
called
him
their
white
brother
they
wanted
to
do
something
to
show
their
appreciation
for
they
said
day
is
not
longer
than
his
kindness
they
had
heard
him
wish
for
a
road
across
part
of
the
island
so
they
banded
together
and
began
to
dig
it
was
hard
work
for
the
heat
was
terrible
there
in
the
tropics
and
they
were
weak
from
being
in
prison
so
long
but
they
worked
for
days
and
days
almost
fainting
when
it
was
done
they
set
up
an
inscription
over
it
calling
it
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
that
they
had
built
to
last
for
ever
betty
paused
a
moment
twisting
the
little
ring
on
her
finger
and
then
repeated
what
she
had
confessed
to
joyce
the
afternoon
that
she
thought
she
must
be
blind
all
the
rest
of
her
life
i
wanted
to
build
a
road
like
that
for
godmother
of
course
i
dig
one
like
those
chiefs
did
and
she
would
have
wanted
it
even
if
i
could
but
i
thought
maybe
i
could
leave
a
memory
behind
me
of
my
visit
that
would
be
like
a
smooth
white
road
you
know
remembering
things
is
like
looking
back
over
a
road
the
unpleasant
things
that
have
happened
are
like
the
rocks
we
stumble
over
but
if
we
have
done
nothing
unpleasant
to
remember
then
we
can
look
back
and
see
it
stretched
out
behind
us
all
smooth
and
white
and
shining
so
from
the
very
first
day
of
my
visit
i
tried
to
leave
nothing
behind
me
for
her
memory
to
stumble
over
not
a
frown
or
a
cross
word
or
a
single
disobedience
nothing
in
all
my
life
ever
made
me
so
happy
as
what
she
said
to
me
the
day
i
left
locust
i
knew
then
that
i
had
succeeded
there
was
nothing
preachy
about
betty
she
did
not
apply
the
story
to
her
hearers
even
in
the
tone
in
which
she
told
it
but
the
silence
that
followed
was
uncomfortable
to
one
squirming
boy
at
least
bradley
remembered
the
and
was
in
haste
to
change
the
subject
say
betty
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
bob
when
you
go
away
i
have
been
trying
for
some
time
to
make
up
my
mind
said
betty
first
i
thought
i
would
take
him
back
to
locust
and
let
him
stay
with
his
brothers
but
i
be
away
so
long
that
he
wo
know
me
when
i
come
back
and
this
afternoon
i
decided
to
give
him
to
davy
oh
really
truly
betty
cried
the
child
tumbling
forward
at
her
feet
in
a
quiver
of
delight
for
he
had
loved
the
frolicsome
puppy
at
first
sight
and
had
kept
it
with
him
every
waking
moment
since
it
came
really
truly
she
repeated
picking
up
the
puppy
and
dropping
him
into
davy
arms
there
sir
go
to
your
new
master
you
rascal
and
remember
that
your
name
is
bob
lewis
any
longer
it
is
bob
appleton
now
davy
squeezed
the
fat
puppy
so
close
in
his
arms
that
his
beaming
face
was
nearly
hidden
by
the
big
bow
of
yellow
ribbon
he
had
never
been
so
happy
in
all
his
life
the
road
that
betty
had
left
in
her
memory
was
not
the
only
one
that
stretched
out
white
and
shining
behind
her
no
matter
how
long
she
might
be
gone
from
the
cuckoo
nest
or
how
the
years
might
pile
up
between
them
in
davy
heart
she
would
be
the
dearest
memory
of
his
childhood
with
bob
she
had
given
him
its
crowning
joy
a
reminder
of
herself
to
live
and
move
and
frisk
beside
him
to
keep
pace
with
every
step
and
to
bring
her
to
his
loving
remembrance
with
every
wag
of
its
stumpy
tail
and
every
glance
of
its
faithful
brown
eyes
again
it
was
early
morning
with
dew
on
the
meadows
as
it
had
been
when
betty
first
ventured
out
into
the
world
now
she
fared
forth
on
another
and
a
longer
pilgrimage
but
this
time
there
was
no
lonely
sinking
of
the
heart
when
she
waved
to
the
group
on
the
porch
she
was
sorry
to
leave
them
but
the
little
colonel
was
with
her
her
godmother
was
to
meet
them
at
the
junction
and
just
beyond
was
the
wonderland
of
the
old
world
through
which
cousin
carl
was
to
be
her
guide
it
was
one
when
they
reached
louisville
the
afternoon
was
taken
up
in
shopping
for
there
were
many
things
that
betty
needed
for
her
voyage
but
by
six
the
new
steamer
trunk
with
all
the
bundles
was
aboard
the
suburban
train
and
betty
with
the
check
in
her
purse
followed
her
godmother
and
lloyd
into
the
car
for
lloydsboro
valley
then
there
were
three
more
nights
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
white
and
gold
room
of
the
house
beautiful
three
more
days
to
wander
up
and
down
the
long
avenue
under
the
locusts
arm
in
arm
with
the
little
colonel
or
to
go
riding
through
the
valley
with
her
on
lad
and
tarbaby
three
more
evenings
to
sit
in
the
long
where
the
light
fell
softly
from
all
the
wax
tapers
in
the
silver
candelabra
and
lloyd
standing
below
the
portrait
of
the
girl
with
the
june
rose
in
her
hair
played
the
harp
that
had
belonged
to
her
beautiful
grandmother
amanthis
then
it
was
time
to
start
to
new
york
for
business
called
him
there
and
betty
was
to
go
in
his
care
it
seemed
to
the
little
colonel
that
the
week
which
followed
that
last
week
of
september
was
the
longest
one
she
had
ever
known
since
the
beginning
of
the
house
party
she
had
not
been
without
a
companion
now
as
she
wandered
aimlessly
around
from
one
old
haunt
to
another
not
knowing
how
to
pass
the
time
it
seemed
she
had
forgotten
how
to
amuse
herself
she
was
waiting
until
the
first
of
october
to
start
to
school
at
last
betty
steamer
letter
came
and
she
dashed
home
from
the
as
fast
as
tarbaby
could
run
to
share
it
with
her
mother
the
letter
was
dated
on
board
the
and
ran
dearest
godmother
and
lloyd
everybody
is
in
the
cabin
writing
letters
to
send
back
by
the
so
here
is
a
little
note
to
tell
you
that
we
are
starting
off
in
fine
style
the
band
is
playing
the
sun
is
shining
and
the
harbour
is
smooth
as
glass
i
have
been
looking
over
the
and
the
deep
green
water
rocking
the
little
boats
out
in
the
harbour
makes
me
think
of
the
white
seal
lullaby
that
godmother
sang
to
us
when
we
had
the
measles
storm
shall
not
wake
thee
nor
shark
overtake
thee
asleep
in
the
arms
of
the
seas
i
know
that
i
shall
think
of
that
many
times
during
the
passage
and
am
sure
we
are
going
to
enjoy
every
minute
of
it
eugenia
sends
lots
of
love
to
you
both
she
is
writing
to
joyce
the
next
time

should
be
perfectly
happy
till

from
me

the
other
side

was
a
hasty
postscript
scribbled
across
the
end
be

you
let
me
know
the
minute
you
hear
anything
from
dot
if
anybody
finds
her
cousin
carl
says
cable
the
word
and
we
will
know
what
you
mean
for
a
few
minutes
after
the
reading
of
the
letter
the
little
colonel
stood
by
the
window
looking
out
without
a
word
then
she
began
i
wish
i
nevah
had
a
house
party
i
wish
i
nevah
known
joyce
or
eugenia
or
betty
i
wish
i
nevah
laid
eyes
on
any
of
them
or
been
to
the
cuckoo
nest
or
or
what
is
the
trouble
now
lloyd
asked
her
mother
wonderingly
then
i
would
be
so
lonesome
now
that
everything
is
ovah
i
despise
that
behind
feelin
moah
than

i
know

and
left

now
and
i
nevah

as
happy
again
as

this
summah
i
suah
of
it
is
the
last
rose
of
summer
left
blooming
alone
all
her
lovely
companions
are
faded
and
gone
sang
sherman
gaily
as
she
came
and
put
an
arm
around
drooping
shoulders
every
summer
brings
its
own
roses
little
daughter
when
the
old
friends
go
look
around
for
new
ones
and
you
always
find
them
i
do
want
any
new
ones
exclaimed
the
little
colonel
gloomily
there
nevah
be
anybody
that
i
take
the
same
interest
in
that
i
do
in
betty
and
joyce
and
eugenia
yet
even
as
she
spoke
there
were
coming
toward
her
life
nearer
and
nearer
as
the
days
went
by
other
friends
who
were
to
have
a
large
part
in
making
its
happiness
and
who
were
to
fill
it
with
new
interests
and
new
pleasures
chapter
and
it
was
hard
for
the
little
colonel
to
start
back
to
school
after
her
long
holiday
hard
in
the
first
place
because
she
was
a
month
behind
her
classes
and
had
extra
to
learn
hard
in
the
second
place
because
a
more
gorgeous
october
had
never
been
known
in
the
valley
and
all
called
to
her
to
come
and
play
in
the
lanes
the
sumach
flamed
crimson
and
in
the
avenues
the
maples
turned
gold
in
the
woods
where
the
nuts
were
dropping
all
day
long
the
hung
out
their
coral
berries
and
every
beech
and
sweet
gum
put
on
a
glory
of
its
own
oh
mothah
i
ca
study
lloyd
declared
one
afternoon
i
do
care
whethah
the
amazon
rivah
rises
in
south
america
or
the
south
pole
an
i
think
those
old
mexicans
were
horrid
to
give
their
volcanoes
an
things
such
terrible
long
names
they
ought
to
have
thought
about
the
trouble
they
were
makin
for
all
the
poah
children
in
the
world
who
would
have
to
learn
to
spell
them
i
nevah
can
learn
popocatepetl
why
did
they
call
it
something
easy
like
like
crosspatch
she
added
closing
her
book
with
a
bang
that
the
way
it
makes
me
feel
anyhow
it
is
going
to
take
all
afternoon
to
get
this
one
lesson
illustration
the
plan
worked
like
a
charm
not
if
you
put
your
mind
on
it
your
lips
have
been
saying
it
over
and
over
but
your
thoughts
seem
to
be
miles
away
but
everything
interrupts
me
complained
lloyd
the
the
woodpeckahs
an
the
are
all
i
goin
in
the
house
an
sit
on
the
stair
steps
an
put
my
fingahs
in
my
yeahs
maybe
i
can
study
bettah
that
way
the
plan
worked
like
a
charm
in
less
than
ten
minutes
she
was
back
again
glibly
reciting
her
geography
lesson
after
that
all
her
were
learned
on
the
stairs
where
no
sights
and
sounds
could
arrest
her
attention
she
was
in
the
midst
of
her
lessons
one
afternoon
her
book
open
on
her
knees
and
her
hands
over
her
ears
when
she
felt
rather
than
heard
the
jar
of
a
heavy
chair
drawn
across
the
porch
dropping
her
hands
from
her
ears
she
heard
her
mother
say
take
this
rocker
allison
i
so
glad
you
have
come
i
have
been
wishing
that
you
would
all
afternoon
oh
it
is
miss
allison
macintyre
thought
lloyd
i
wish
i
did
have
to
study
while
she
is
heah
i
love
to
listen
to
her
talk
thinking
to
get
through
as
soon
as
possible
she
turned
her
attention
resolutely
to
her
book
but
after
a
few
moments
she
could
not
resist
stopping
to
lift
her
head
and
listen
just
to
find
out
what
subject
they
were
discussing
although
miss
allison
was
her
mother
friend
lloyd
claimed
her
as
her
own
especial
property
but
all
children
did
that
such
was
the
charming
interest
with
which
she
entered
into
comradeship
with
every
boy
and
girl
in
the
valley
that
they
counted
her
one
of
themselves
a
party
without
miss
allison
was
not
to
be
thought
of
and
a
picnic
was
sure
to
be
a
failure
unless
she
was
one
of
the
number
the
two
little
knights
keith
and
malcolm
were
privileged
by
reason
of
family
ties
to
call
her
auntie
but
there
were
many
like
lloyd
who
put
her
on
a
pedestal
in
their
affections
and
claimed
a
kinship
almost
as
dear
presently
lloyd
caught
a
word
that
made
her
prick
up
her
ears
and
she
leaned
forward
listening
eagerly
sister
mary
children
are
coming
out
next
saturday
i
was
lying
awake
last
night
wondering
what
i
could
do
to
entertain
them
when
it
popped
into
my
head
that
saturday
will
be
the
last
day
of
october
and
of
course
they
want
to
celebrate
sister
mary
children
repeated
lloyd
to
herself
with
a
puzzled
expression
that
suddenly
turned
to
one
of
joyful
recollection
oh
she
means
the
little
waltons
i
wondah
how
long
they
been
back
in
america
her
geography
slipped
unnoticed
to
the
floor
as
she
sat
thinking
of
her
old
playmates
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
their
departure
for
the
philippines
and
wondering
if
they
had
changed
much
in
their
long
absence
there
were
four
of
them
ranald
she
remembered
that
he
must
be
fourteen
now
counting
by
his
cousin
malcolm
age
and
his
three
younger
sisters
allison
kitty
and
elise
some
of
the
happiest
days
that
lloyd
could
remember
had
been
the
ones
spent
with
them
in
the
big
tent
pitched
on
the
macintyre
lawn
for
no
matter
how
far
west
was
the
army
post
at
which
their
father
happened
to
be
stationed
they
had
been
brought
back
every
summer
to
visit
their
grandmother
in
the
old
kentucky
home
lloyd
had
not
seen
them
since
their
father
had
been
made
a
general
and
they
had
gone
away
on
the
transport
to
the
strange
new
life
in
the
philippines
although
many
interesting
letters
were
sent
back
to
the
valley
in
which
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
interested
it
happened
that
lloyd
had
never
heard
any
of
them
read
her
old
playmates
seemed
to
have
dropped
completely
out
of
her
life
until
one
sad
day
when
the
country
hung
its
flags
at
and
the
black
in
every
newspaper
in
the
land
announced
the
loss
of
a
nation
hero
lloyd
remembered
how
strange
it
seemed
to
read
the
account
and
know
it
was
ranald
father
who
was
meant
she
thought
of
them
often
in
the
weeks
that
followed
for
papa
jack
could
not
pick
up
a
newspaper
without
reading
some
touching
tribute
to
the
brave
general
memory
some
beautiful
eulogy
on
his
heroic
life
but
somehow
the
strange
experiences
her
little
playmates
were
passing
through
seemed
to
set
them
apart
from
other
children
in
lloyd
imagination
and
she
thought
of
them
as
people
in
a
book
instead
of
children
she
had
romped
with
through
many
a
long
summer
day
as
she
listened
to
the
voice
on
the
porch
she
found
that
miss
allison
was
talking
about
her
sister
and
telling
some
of
the
interesting
things
that
had
happened
to
the
children
in
manila
it
was
more
than
the
little
colonel
could
endure
to
sit
in
the
house
and
hear
only
snatches
of
conversation
oh
mothah
let
me
come
out
and
listen
she
begged
study
instead
if
you
will
i
learn
two
sets
of
lessons
if
you
let
me
put
it
off
just
this
once
there
was
a
laughing
consent
given
and
the
next
moment
lloyd
was
seated
on
a
low
stool
at
miss
allison
feet
looking
up
into
her
face
with
an
expectant
smile
ready
for
every
word
that
might
fall
from
her
lips
i
was
telling
your
mother
about
ranald
began
miss
allison
she
asked
me
how
it
came
about
that
such
a
little
fellow
was
made
captain
in
the
army
oh
was
he
a
captain
cried
lloyd
in
surprise
i
thought
it
was
just
a
nickname
like
mine
that
they
gave
him
because
his
father
was
a
general
no
he
was
really
a
captain
the
youngest
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
volunteers
for
he
received
his
appointment
and
his
a
few
weeks
before
his
twelfth
birthday
he
never
forget
that
fourth
of
july
if
he
lives
to
be
a
hundred
for
those
meant
more
to
him
than
all
the
noise
and
and
of
all
the
boys
in
america
put
together
you
see
he
had
been
under
fire
at
the
battle
of
san
pedro
macati
he
had
gone
out
with
his
father
a
short
time
after
they
landed
in
manila
and
the
general
in
command
invited
them
out
on
the
firing
line
before
they
realised
their
peril
they
suddenly
found
themselves
under
a
sharp
fire
from
the
enemy
one
of
the
staff
said
afterward
that
he
had
never
seen
greater
coolness
in
the
face
of
as
great
danger
and
all
the
officers
praised
his
for
a
little
while
the
bullets
whizzed
around
him
thick
and
fast
one
hit
the
ground
between
his
feet
another
grazed
his
hat
but
all
he
said
as
one
hummed
by
was
papa
did
you
see
that
it
looked
like
a
it
was
a
terrible
sight
for
a
child
eyes
for
he
saw
war
in
all
its
horrors
and
his
mother
did
not
want
him
to
take
the
risks
of
any
more
but
he
was
a
true
soldier
son
and
insisted
on
following
his
father
wherever
it
was
possible
for
him
to
go
at
the
battle
of
zapote
river
he
was
in
no
danger
for
he
had
been
put
in
a
church
tower
overlooking
the
field
but
that
was
a
terrible
ordeal
for
all
day
long
he
stood
by
the
window
expecting
any
minute
to
see
his
father
fall
all
day
long
he
looked
for
him
towering
above
his
men
and
whenever
he
lost
sight
of
him
for
awhile
he
leaned
out
to
watch
the
litters
the
men
were
carrying
into
the
church
below
where
they
brought
the
dead
and
dying
it
was
always
with
the
sickening
dread
that
the
still
figure
on
some
one
of
them
might
be
that
of
his
beloved
father
sister
mary
sent
me
a
copy
of
the
official
announcement
that
gave
him
the
rank
of
captain
it
mentions
his
coolness
under
fire
you
may
imagine
i
am
quite
proud
of
that
little
document
for
i
always
think
of
ranald
as
he
was
when
i
had
him
with
me
most
a
sensitive
little
fellow
with
golden
curls
and
big
brown
eyes
as
silent
and
reserved
as
his
father
you
see
i
know
that
his
courage
has
no
element
of
daring
recklessness
so
many
things
he
did
showed
that
even
when
he
was
a
baby
it
is
just
quiet
grit
that
takes
him
through
the
things
that
hardier
boys
might
court
that
and
his
strong
will
at
first
he
was
appointed
on
his
father
staff
and
went
with
him
on
all
his
expeditions
and
rode
on
a
dear
little
filipino
pony
the
natives
called
him
the
pickaninny
captain
he
was
under
fire
again
at
the
capture
of
calamba
and
soon
after
he
was
made
an
aide
on
fred
grant
staff
once
while
under
him
he
was
ordered
back
in
charge
of
some
insurgents
guns
that
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
americans
to
be
turned
in
at
headquarters
so
you
see
he
was
a
captain
as
you
called
him
oh
tell
some
more
miss
allison
begged
lloyd
thinking
that
the
subject
might
be
dropped
when
miss
allison
paused
for
a
moment
well
i
hardly
know
what
else
to
tell
his
room
is
full
of
relics
and
trophies
he
brought
home
with
him
shells
and
bullets
and
bolos
great
savage
knives
with
zigzag
blades
flags
curios
all
sorts
of
things
that
he
picked
up
or
that
the
officers
gave
him
his
mother
can
tell
you
volumes
of
interesting
experiences
he
has
had
but
he
is
as
shy
and
modest
as
ever
about
his
own
affairs
and
maybe
he
never
speak
of
them
he
tell
you
possibly
of
the
deer
which
the
english
consul
gave
him
and
the
pet
monkey
that
followed
him
everywhere
even
when
it
had
to
swim
out
through
a
rice
swamp
after
him
maybe
he
mention
the
filipino
pony
that
the
officers
gave
him
when
he
came
back
to
america
but
he
rarely
speaks
of
those
graver
experiences
those
scenes
of
battle
and
bloodshed
it
does
seem
possible
that
it
is
ranald
who
has
seen
and
done
all
those
things
said
the
little
colonel
thoughtfully
when
you
play
with
people
and
fuss
with
them
and
slap
their
faces
when
they
pull
your
hair
or
throw
away
their
marbles
when
they
break
your
dolls
as
we
did
when
we
were
little
it
seems
so
queah
to
think
of
them
miss
allison
laughed
heartily
that
a
universal
trouble
she
said
we
never
can
be
heroes
to
our
family
and
neighbours
even
brass
buttons
and
can
not
outshine
the
memory
of
early
tell
about
the
girls
said
lloyd
fearing
that
if
a
pause
were
allowed
in
the
conversation
miss
allison
would
begin
talking
about
something
less
entertaining
than
her
nephew
and
nieces
do
they
still
love
to
play
papah
dolls
and
have
tableaux
in
the
barn
yes
i
am
sure
they
do
they
did
have
as
exciting
a
time
as
ranald
for
of
course
they
stayed
at
home
with
their
mother
in
the
palace
at
manila
but
it
was
interesting
it
had
queer
windows
of
little
sliding
squares
of
that
were
shut
only
when
it
rained
they
could
peep
through
and
see
the
coolies
in
their
capes
and
skirts
of
fibre
and
the
big
hats
like
inverted
baskets
that
made
them
look
as
if
they
had
stepped
out
of
robinson
crusoe
story
on
one
side
of
the
palace
was
the
pasig
river
where
the
natives
go
by
in
their
long
skiffs
on
the
other
side
were
the
sights
of
the
streets
sometimes
it
was
only
an
old
peanut
vendor
whom
they
watched
or
a
man
with
fruit
or
boiled
eggs
or
shrimps
or
dulce
sometimes
it
was
the
seller
of
parched
corn
squatting
beside
the
earthen
pot
of
embers
which
he
constantly
fanned
as
he
turned
the
ears
laid
across
it
to
roast
and
sometimes
the
ambulances
went
by
on
their
way
to
the
hospital
reminding
them
that
life
on
the
island
was
not
a
happy
for
every
one
i
am
sure
that
the
lady
of
shalott
never
saw
more
entertaining
pictures
in
her
magic
mirror
than
the
panorama
that
daily
passed
those
windows
of
time
never
dragged
there
you
may
be
sure
sometimes
they
were
invited
to
spend
an
afternoon
on
the
english
and
the
young
officers
gave
them
a
spread
and
a
romp
over
the
ship
allison
still
keeps
an
old
hat
with
the
ship
ribbon
on
it
for
a
which
a
gallant
little
midshipman
gave
her
to
remind
her
of
the
good
times
they
had
had
together
on
the
vessel
the
english
consul
and
frequently
invited
them
to
tiffin
or
to
parties
and
their
garden
of
monkeys
was
open
to
their
little
american
neighbours
at
all
times
coming
home
the
transport
stopped
in
a
japanese
harbour
for
a
week
the
faithful
old
japanese
servants
fuzzi
and
her
husband
who
had
lived
with
them
in
california
and
followed
them
to
the
philippines
were
with
them
on
the
transport
this
place
where
they
stopped
happened
to
be
their
native
town
so
they
took
the
children
on
land
every
day
and
gave
them
a
glimpse
behind
the
scenes
of
japanese
life
which
few
foreigners
see
then
allison
had
a
birthday
while
they
were
homeward
bound
away
out
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
and
the
ship
cook
surprised
her
by
making
her
a
magnificent
birthday
cake
with
her
name
on
it
in
icing
oh
they
had
all
sorts
of
unusual
experiences
and
many
no
doubt
that
i
have
never
heard
of
although
they
have
been
back
in
america
a
year
but
now
that
they
have
taken
a
house
in
town
i
expect
to
have
them
with
me
a
great
deal
and
that
brings
me
to
the
matter
i
came
up
to
see
you
both
about
they
are
coming
out
saturday
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
give
them
a
party
another
holiday
exclaimed
lloyd
clapping
her
hands
i
had
forgotten
that
there
was
anything
to
celebrate
between
fourth
of
july
and
thanksgiving
i
never
went
to
a
party
in
my
life
but
it
sounds
as
if
it
would
be
lots
of
fun
do
you
remember
the
old
house
at
hartwell
hollow
that
has
been
vacant
so
long
asked
miss
allison
the
coloured
people
say
it
is
haunted
of
course
we
do
not
believe
such
foolish
things
or
any
of
the
foolishness
of
in
fact
but
as
long
as
we
going
to
resurrect
the
old
superstitions
it
is
appropriate
to
have
a
haunted
house
for
the
purpose
the
landlord
says
that
it
is
that
report
which
keeps
it
vacant
i
saw
him
this
morning
and
got
his
permission
to
use
it
for
the
party
i
think
we
can
make
an
ideal
spot
of
it
i
have
it
swept
and
cleaned
and
on
saturday
afternoon
i
want
you
both
to
come
and
help
me
decorate
it
of
course
the
only
lights
must
be
said
sherman
entering
into
the
plan
as
heartily
as
if
she
had
been
lloyd
age
the
is
full
of
pumpkins
walker
can
make
lanterns
all
day
if
necessary
it
will
take
nearly
a
hundred
will
it
not
allison
i
think
so
although
we
will
light
only
the
rooms
but
there
ought
to
be
some
large
ones
on
the
porches
we
try
all
the
old
charms
that
we
tried
when
we
were
children
bake
a
fate
cake
melt
lead
bob
for
apples
and
observe
every
silly
old
custom
that
we
can
think
of
the
house
is
unfurnished
except
for
an
old
stove
in
the
kitchen
but
i
can
easily
send
over
enough
tables
and
chairs
miss
allison
went
away
soon
after
they
had
finished
all
their
plans
and
lloyd
stood
looking
after
her
as
long
as
she
was
in
sight
how
can
i
wait
until
saturday
she
asked
with
a
wriggle
of
impatience
i
so
glad
she
asked
us
to
help
getting
ready
for
things
is
nearly
as
much
fun
as
the
things
themselves
but
pahties
and
do
mix
very
well
i
be
thinking
about
that
now
instead
of
my
lessons
oh
mothah
it
seems
to
me
i
nevah
can
learn
to
spell
that
old
volcano
i
knew
how
last
week
but
i
missed
it
again
yestahday
when
we
had
review
in
spelling
i
have
thought
of
a
way
to
mix
and
in
such
a
way
that
you
will
never
forget
one
word
at
least
said
her
mother
tell
walker
to
bring
the
largest
roundest
pumpkin
that
he
can
find
in
the
field
and
put
it
on
the
bench
by
the
call
me
when
he
is
ready
wondering
what
pumpkins
and
volcanoes
had
to
do
with
each
other
but
charmed
with
the
novelty
of
her
mother
way
of
teaching
spelling
lloyd
went
skipping
down
the
path
to
give
the
order
to
walker
it
was
only
a
little
while
until
she
was
back
again
it
is
the
biggest
pumpkin
i
evah
saw
she
reported
it
was
too
big
fo
walkah
to
carry
he
had
to
bring
it
up
on
a
wheelbarrow
taking
a
as
she
passed
through
the
kitchen
sherman
caught
up
her
dainty
skirts
and
followed
lloyd
down
the
path
to
the
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
a
touch
of
frost
was
in
the
air
the
yellow
maple
leaves
were
floating
softly
down
from
the
branches
above
the
path
and
wherever
the
sun
touched
them
on
the
ground
lay
a
carpet
of
shining
gold
see
mothah
is
it
a
whoppah
cried
lloyd
trying
to
put
her
arms
around
the
mammoth
pumpkin
on
the
bench
it
is
a
beauty
answered
sherman
as
she
began
deftly
outlining
a
face
on
one
side
of
it
with
the
sharp
first
she
drew
two
large
circles
in
the
yellow
skin
where
the
eyes
were
to
be
cut
a
triangle
for
the
nose
and
a
grinning
crescent
just
below
for
the
mouth
now
she
said
passing
the
knife
to
lloyd
carve
the
letters
in
each
circle
it
does
not
matter
if
they
are
crooked
they
are
to
be
cut
out
with
the
circle
afterwhile
now
in
the
triangle
put
the
word
cat
and
the
letter
e
after
it
and
in
the
crescent
the
word
pet
and
the
letter
now
what
does
the
face
say
to
you
the
eyes
say
popo
the
nose
and
the
mouth
answered
lloyd
laughing
at
the
comical
face
outlined
on
the
pumpkin
shut
your
eyes
and
spell
popocatepetl
said
sherman
why
it
is
just
as
easy
cried
lloyd
as
she
rattled
it
off
i
can
see
each
syllable
grinning
at
me
one
aftah
the
othah
i
am
suah
nevah
it
now
i
like
your
way
of
teaching
bettah
than
anybody
presently
as
she
scooped
out
the
seeds
while
her
mother
made
a
mandarin
hat
of
the
slice
she
had
cut
off
below
the
stem
she
said
old
popocatepetl
will
make
the
biggest
of
them
all
it
a
good
name
for
him
too
because
he
be
all
smoke
and
fiah
inside
aftah
the
candles
are
lighted
we
can
put
him
ovah
the
front
doah
i
wondah
what
allison
and
kitty
and
elise
will
think
of
him
oh
mothah
do
you
remembah
the
time
that
kitty
set
all
the
clocks
and
watches
in
the
house
back
a
whole
hour
and
made
everybody
late
fo
church
and
the
time
she
folded
a
grasshoppah
up
in
everybody
napkin
the
night
the
ministah
was
invited
to
macintyre
to
dinnah
and
what
a
mighty
there
was
as
soon
as
the
napkins
were
unfolded
once
started
on
kitty
pranks
lloyd
went
on
with
a
chapter
of
you
remember
this
and
do
you
remember
that
until
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
western
hills
and
old
popocatepetl
grinned
in
ugly
completeness
even
to
the
last
tooth
in
his
jaw
chapter
xi
a
party
nothing
worse
than
rats
and
spiders
haunted
the
old
house
of
hartwell
hollow
but
set
far
back
from
the
road
in
a
tangle
of
vines
and
cedars
it
looked
lonely
and
neglected
enough
to
give
rise
to
almost
any
report
the
long
unused
road
winding
among
the
rockeries
from
gate
to
house
was
hidden
by
a
rank
growth
of
grass
and
mullein
from
one
of
the
trees
beside
it
an
aged
swung
down
its
long
snaky
limbs
as
if
a
bunch
of
giant
serpents
had
been
caught
up
in
a
writhing
mass
and
left
to
dangle
from
to
earth
cobwebs
veiled
the
windows
and
dead
leaves
had
drifted
across
the
porches
until
they
lay
in
some
of
the
corners
as
miss
allison
paused
in
front
of
the
doorstep
with
the
keys
a
snake
glided
across
her
path
and
disappeared
in
one
of
the
tangled
rockeries
both
the
coloured
women
who
were
with
her
jumped
back
and
one
screamed
it
wo
hurt
you
sylvia
said
miss
allison
laughingly
an
old
poet
who
owned
this
place
when
i
was
a
child
made
pets
of
all
the
snakes
and
even
brought
some
up
from
the
woods
as
he
did
the
wild
flowers
that
is
a
perfectly
harmless
kind
maybe
so
honey
said
old
sylvia
with
a
wag
of
her
turbaned
head
but
i
all
i
do
it
a
bad
sign
to
meet
up
wid
one
right
on
de
if
it
was
fo
you
miss
allison
i
would
put
foot
in
such
a
house
an
i
tell
you
what
i
says
is
gospel
truth
if
i
ketch
sound
of
a
ha
so
much
as
even
a
rustlin
on
de
flo
ole
sylvia
gwine
a
windah
fo
you
kin
say
ketch
dis
ole
niggah
foolin
roun
long
whar
is
pete
got
to
go
in
first
an
open
de
house
but
not
even
the
rats
interrupted
sylvia
in
her
sweeping
and
garnishing
and
by
four
all
the
rooms
which
were
to
be
used
were
as
clean
as
three
of
macintyre
best
trained
servants
could
make
them
even
ole
miss
would
call
that
clean
said
sylvia
looking
around
on
the
white
floors
and
shining
with
a
satisfied
air
sherman
had
driven
down
some
time
before
with
a
of
and
was
now
arranging
them
in
rows
on
all
the
black
mantels
she
looked
around
as
sylvia
spoke
it
would
have
been
spookier
to
have
left
the
dust
and
cobwebs
she
said
but
this
is
certainly
nicer
and
more
cheerful
fires
were
blazing
on
every
hearth
in
parlour
and
hall
to
dissipate
the
dampness
of
the
long
unused
rooms
a
kettle
was
singing
on
the
kitchen
stove
and
tables
and
chairs
had
been
brought
over
and
arranged
in
the
empty
rooms
all
that
the
woods
could
contribute
in
the
way
of
crimson
berries
trailing
vines
and
late
autumn
leaves
had
been
brought
in
to
brighten
the
bare
walls
and
festoon
the
uncurtained
windows
the
chestnuts
the
apples
the
tubs
of
water
the
lead
and
everything
else
necessary
for
the
working
of
the
charms
was
in
readiness
the
refreshments
were
in
the
pantry
and
on
the
kitchen
table
lloyd
was
arranging
the
ingredients
for
the
fate
cake
there
could
be
a
bettah
place
for
a
pahty
she
said
looking
around
the
rooms
when
all
was
done
no
mattah
how
much
we
romp
and
play
there
nothing
that
can
be
hurt
wo
it
look
shivery
when
all
the
are
lighted
just
as
if
some
old
ogah
of
a
bluebeard
lived
heah
who
kept
the
heads
of
all
his
wives
and
neighbours
sittin
around
on
all
the
mantels
an
shelves
it
was
in
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
last
bright
october
sunset
that
they
drove
away
from
the
house
to
go
home
to
dinner
even
then
the
grounds
looked
desolate
and
forlorn
but
it
was
doubly
gruesome
when
they
came
back
at
night
the
little
colonel
and
her
mother
were
first
to
arrive
they
had
offered
to
come
early
and
light
the
lanterns
as
miss
allison
was
expecting
all
her
nieces
and
nephews
on
the
seven
train
and
wanted
to
go
down
to
meet
them
the
wind
was
blowing
in
fitful
gusts
rustling
the
dead
leaves
and
swaying
the
snaky
branches
of
the
until
they
seemed
startlingly
alive
now
and
then
the
moon
looked
out
like
a
pale
bleared
eye
it
is
a
real
tam
night
said
miss
allison
as
she
led
the
way
up
the
winding
walk
to
the
front
door
i
can
easily
imagine
witches
flying
over
my
head
ca
you
she
asked
turning
to
the
little
group
surrounding
her
there
were
eight
children
for
not
only
ranald
and
his
sisters
had
come
with
malcolm
and
keith
but
rob
moore
and
his
cousin
anna
had
been
invited
to
come
out
from
town
to
try
their
fortunes
at
hartwell
hollow
and
spend
the
night
in
the
valley
where
they
always
passed
their
happy
summers
oh
auntie
what
that
cried
little
elise
holding
tightly
to
miss
allison
hand
as
she
caught
sight
of
lloyd
old
popocatepetl
grinning
a
welcome
by
the
front
door
he
looked
like
a
mammoth
dragon
spouting
fire
from
nose
eyes
and
mouth
elise
clung
a
little
closer
to
miss
allison
side
as
they
drew
nearer
what
awful
teeth
it
got
has
it
nothing
but
grains
of
corn
dear
lloyd
stuck
them
in
you
forgotten
the
little
colonel
have
you
she
is
inside
the
house
now
waiting
to
see
you
then
miss
allison
turned
to
the
others
step
high
children
every
one
of
you
when
you
come
to
this
broomstick
lying
across
the
be
sure
to
step
over
it
or
some
witch
might
slip
in
with
you
it
is
the
only
way
to
keep
them
out
on
step
high
elise
here
we
go
that
one
of
the
nice
things
about
auntie
kitty
confided
to
anna
moore
as
they
followed
she
acts
as
if
she
really
believes
those
old
charms
and
that
makes
them
seem
so
real
that
we
enjoy
them
so
much
more
the
little
colonel
waiting
in
the
hall
for
the
guests
to
arrive
had
been
feeling
a
little
shy
about
renewing
her
acquaintance
with
ranald
and
his
sisters
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
must
have
seen
so
much
and
learned
so
much
in
their
trip
around
the
world
that
they
would
not
care
to
talk
about
ordinary
matters
but
when
they
all
came
tumbling
in
over
the
broomstick
they
seemed
to
tumble
at
the
same
time
from
the
pedestals
where
her
imagination
had
placed
them
back
into
the
old
familiar
footing
just
where
they
had
been
before
they
went
away
lloyd
had
thought
about
ranald
many
times
since
miss
allison
account
of
him
had
made
him
a
hero
in
her
eyes
she
could
not
think
of
him
in
any
way
but
as
dressed
in
a
uniform
riding
along
under
fluttering
flags
to
the
sound
of
martial
music
so
when
miss
allison
called
here
is
the
captain
little
colonel
her
face
flushed
as
if
she
were
about
to
meet
some
distinguished
stranger
but
it
was
the
same
quiet
ranald
who
greeted
her
much
taller
than
when
he
went
away
but
dressed
just
like
the
other
boys
and
not
even
bronzed
by
his
long
marches
under
the
tropical
sun
the
year
that
had
passed
since
his
return
had
blotted
out
all
trace
of
his
soldier
life
in
his
appearance
except
perhaps
the
military
erectness
with
which
he
held
himself
kitty
after
catching
lloyd
by
the
shoulders
for
an
impulsive
hug
and
kiss
started
at
once
to
examine
the
haunted
house
there
be
mischief
brewing
in
a
little
bit
i
promise
you
said
miss
allison
as
kitty
head
with
its
short
black
hair
dodged
past
her
and
there
was
a
flash
of
a
red
dress
up
the
stairway
she
is
looking
for
the
that
sylvia
told
her
were
up
there
elise
clung
to
allison
hand
for
the
little
sister
wanted
the
protection
of
the
big
one
in
those
rooms
lighted
only
by
the
fires
and
the
yellow
gleam
of
those
rows
of
weird
uncanny
faces
like
kitty
both
allison
and
elise
had
big
dark
eyes
that
might
have
been
the
pride
of
a
spanish
señorita
they
were
so
large
and
lustrous
kitty
curls
had
been
cut
but
theirs
hung
thick
and
long
on
their
shoulders
the
sight
of
them
moved
rob
to
a
compliment
you
and
anna
moore
make
me
think
of
night
and
morning
he
said
looking
from
anna
golden
hair
to
allison
dusky
curls
one
is
so
light
and
one
is
so
black
you
ought
to
go
around
together
all
the
time
you
look
fine
together
rob
is
growing
up
laughed
anne
two
years
ago
he
would
have
thought
about
making
pretty
speeches
about
our
hair
he
just
have
pulled
it
here
comes
a
whole
crowd
of
people
exclaimed
allison
as
the
door
opened
again
i
wonder
how
many
of
the
girls
i
know
oh
corinne
and
katie
and
margery
and
julia
forrest
why
nobody
seems
to
have
changed
a
bit
come
on
lloyd
let
go
and
speak
to
them
i
glad
that
everybody
is
coming
early
said
lloyd
so
that
we
can
begin
the
fate
cake
that
was
the
first
performance
when
the
guests
had
all
arrived
they
were
taken
into
the
kitchen
under
the
ban
of
silence
for
the
speaking
of
a
word
would
have
broken
the
charm
they
stood
around
the
table
giggling
as
the
cake
was
concocted
out
of
a
cup
of
salt
a
cup
of
flour
and
enough
water
to
make
a
thick
batter
a
ring
a
thimble
a
dime
and
a
button
were
dropped
into
it
and
each
guest
gave
the
mixture
a
solemn
stir
before
the
pan
was
put
into
the
oven
and
left
in
charge
of
old
mom
beck
by
that
time
the
two
tubs
of
water
had
been
carried
into
the
hall
several
dozen
apples
were
set
afloat
in
them
with
a
folded
strip
of
paper
pinned
to
each
bearing
a
hidden
name
by
the
time
these
had
been
lifted
out
by
their
stems
in
the
teeth
of
the
laughing
contestants
the
lead
was
melted
ready
to
use
they
tried
their
fate
with
that
next
pouring
a
little
out
into
a
plate
of
water
to
see
into
what
shapes
the
drops
would
instantly
harden
strangely
enough
ranald
took
the
shape
of
a
sword
malcolm
was
a
lion
and
keith
a
ship
the
little
colonel
a
star
and
rob
a
spur
some
could
have
been
called
almost
anything
like
the
one
little
elise
found
in
her
plate
she
could
not
decide
whether
to
call
it
a
or
a
chicken
but
miss
allison
explained
them
all
giving
some
funny
meaning
to
each
and
setting
them
all
to
laughing
with
the
queer
fortunes
she
declared
these
lead
drops
predicted
they
tried
all
the
old
customs
they
had
ever
heard
of
they
popped
chestnuts
on
a
shovel
they
counted
they
threw
the
parings
over
their
heads
to
see
what
initials
they
would
form
in
falling
they
blindfolded
each
other
and
groped
across
the
room
to
the
table
on
which
stood
three
saucers
one
filled
with
ashes
one
with
water
and
one
standing
empty
to
see
whether
life
death
or
single
blessedness
awaited
them
in
the
coming
year
in
the
midst
of
these
games
kitty
beckoned
the
boys
aside
and
led
them
out
on
the
porch
what
do
you
think
she
whispered
after
all
the
trouble
auntie
has
taken
to
plan
different
entertainments
cora
ferris
is
satisfied
i
heard
her
talking
to
some
of
the
older
girls
she
told
eliza
hughes
that
she
expected
some
excitement
when
she
came
and
that
she
was
dying
to
go
down
cellar
backward
with
a
in
one
hand
and
a
candle
in
the
other
you
know
if
you
do
that
the
person
whom
you
to
marry
will
come
and
look
over
your
shoulder
and
you
can
see
him
in
the
glass
the
girls
begged
her
not
to
and
told
her
that
she
be
frightened
to
death
if
she
saw
anybody
but
she
whispered
to
eliza
that
she
knew
she
would
be
scared
for
she
was
sure
walter
cummins
was
her
fate
and
would
have
to
be
down
in
the
cellar
if
she
tried
the
charm
and
that
she
would
be
afraid
of
going
into
a
lion
den
if
she
thought
walter
would
be
there
and
eliza
giggled
and
threatened
to
tell
and
cora
got
red
and
put
her
hand
over
eliza
mouth
and
carried
on
awfully
silly
it
made
me
tired
but
she
bound
to
go
down
cellar
after
awhile
and
somebody
has
told
walter
what
she
said
and
he
going
just
for
fun
now
i
think
it
would
be
lots
of
fun
to
watch
walter
and
keep
him
from
going
on
some
excuse
or
another
and
then
one
of
you
boys
look
over
her
shoulder
rob
you
the
biggest
and
almost
as
tall
as
walter
you
ought
to
be
the
one
to
go
suggested
keith
down
in
that
spook
cellar
demanded
rob
not
much
keithie
my
son
i
might
see
something
myself
without
the
help
of
a
or
candle
i
am
not
afraid
of
flesh
and
blood
but
i
vow
i
not
ready
to
have
my
hair
turn
white
in
a
single
night
i
have
been
brought
up
on
stories
of
the
haunts
that
live
in
that
cellar
my
old
black
mammy
used
to
live
here
and
she
has
made
me
feel
as
if
my
blood
had
turned
to
lots
of
times
with
her
tales
you
go
captain
said
malcolm
turning
to
ranald
you
been
under
fire
and
ought
to
be
afraid
of
anything
you
got
a
reputation
to
keep
up
and
here
is
a
chance
for
you
to
show
the
stuff
you
are
made
of
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
cellar
said
the
little
captain
stoutly
but
i
not
going
to
be
the
one
to
look
over
her
shoulder
into
the
i
do
want
to
run
any
risk
of
marrying
that
fat
cora
ferris
a
shout
of
laughter
went
up
at
his
answer
you
wo
have
to
goosey
said
rob
there
nothing
in
those
old
signs
well
i
am
not
going
to
take
any
chances
with
her
he
persisted
backing
up
against
the
wall
that
settled
it
they
could
have
moved
the
rock
foundation
of
the
house
itself
easier
than
the
captain
when
he
took
that
kind
of
a
stand
looking
at
it
from
ranald
point
of
view
none
of
the
boys
were
willing
to
go
down
cellar
for
they
could
easily
imagine
how
the
others
would
tease
them
afterward
kitty
prank
would
have
fallen
through
if
she
had
not
been
quicker
than
a
weasel
at
planning
mischief
what
to
hinder
fixing
up
a
dummy
man
and
putting
him
down
there
she
suggested
you
boys
can
run
home
and
get
uncle
harry
rubber
boots
and
his
old
slouch
hat
and
some
pillows
and
that
military
cape
that
ginger
father
left
there
and
she
think
it
is
an
army
officer
that
she
going
to
marry
wo
she
be
fooled
the
boys
were
as
quick
to
act
as
kitty
was
to
plan
a
noisy
game
of
blind
man
buff
was
going
on
inside
the
house
so
no
one
missed
the
conspirators
although
they
were
gone
for
some
time
we
just
ran
home
a
minute
for
something
was
keith
excuse
when
he
and
malcolm
and
ranald
came
in
and
breathless
rob
and
kitty
were
still
in
the
cellar
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
army
officer
kitty
was
recklessly
fastening
the
dummy
together
with
big
regardless
of
the
holes
she
was
making
in
her
uncle
high
rubber
is
he
a
dandy
exclaimed
rob
putting
the
slouched
hat
on
the
pillow
head
at
a
fierce
angle
and
fastening
the
military
cape
up
around
the
chin
as
far
as
possible
come
on
now
kitty
let
us
make
our
escape
before
anybody
comes
illustration
she
began
the
old
rhyme
meanwhile
the
boys
had
corralled
walter
cummins
and
cora
seeing
him
leave
the
room
thought
that
the
proper
time
had
come
slipping
the
from
the
in
the
room
where
they
had
left
their
wraps
she
took
a
candle
from
one
of
the
on
the
side
porch
and
signalled
the
girls
who
had
agreed
to
follow
her
she
was
nearly
sixteen
but
the
three
girls
who
groped
their
way
across
the
courtyard
in
the
flickering
light
of
her
candle
were
much
younger
the
cellar
was
entered
from
the
courtyard
by
an
door
the
kind
best
adapted
to
sliding
and
it
took
the
united
strength
of
all
the
girls
to
lift
it
a
rush
of
cold
damp
air
greeted
them
and
an
earthy
smell
that
would
have
checked
the
enthusiasm
of
any
girl
less
sentimental
than
cora
i
am
frightened
to
death
girls
she
confessed
at
the
last
moment
her
teeth
chattering
yet
she
was
not
so
frightened
as
she
would
have
been
had
she
not
been
sure
that
walter
had
gone
down
the
steps
ahead
of
her
hold
the
door
open
she
said
preparing
to
back
slowly
down
her
fluffy
light
hair
stood
out
like
an
aureole
in
the
yellow
and
the
face
reflected
in
the
was
pretty
enough
to
answer
every
requirement
of
the
old
spell
despite
the
silly
simper
on
her
lips
when
she
was
nearly
at
the
bottom
of
the
cellar
steps
she
began
the
old
rhyme
if
in
this
glass
his
face
i
see
then
my
true
love
will
marry
me
but
the
couplet
ended
in
a
scream
so
terrifying
so
so
that
katie
dropped
in
a
cold
trembling
little
heap
on
the
ground
and
eliza
hughes
sank
down
on
top
of
katie
weak
and
shivering
cora
had
seen
the
in
the
cellar
dropping
the
with
a
crash
but
clinging
desperately
to
the
candle
she
dashed
up
the
steps
shrieking
at
every
breath
just
at
the
top
she
stepped
on
the
front
of
her
skirt
and
fell
sprawling
forward
she
dropped
the
candle
then
but
not
before
it
had
touched
her
hair
and
set
it
afire
the
soft
fluffy
bangs
blazed
up
like
tow
and
too
terrified
to
move
eliza
hughes
still
sat
on
top
of
katie
screaming
louder
than
cora
had
done
the
sight
brought
katie
to
her
senses
however
and
scrambling
up
from
under
eliza
she
flew
at
cora
and
began
beating
out
the
fire
with
her
bare
hands
cora
who
had
not
discovered
that
her
hair
was
ablaze
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
such
strange
treatment
her
first
thought
was
that
katie
had
gone
crazy
with
fright
and
that
was
why
she
had
flown
at
her
and
begun
to
beat
her
on
the
head
it
was
all
over
in
an
instant
and
the
fire
put
out
so
quickly
that
only
cora
bangs
were
scorched
and
katie
fingers
but
slightly
burned
but
the
screams
had
reached
through
the
uproar
of
blind
man
buff
and
the
whole
party
poured
out
into
the
courtyard
to
see
what
had
happened
there
was
great
excitement
for
a
little
while
and
kitty
enjoying
the
confusion
she
had
stirred
up
giggled
as
she
listened
to
startling
description
of
the
man
that
had
peeped
over
her
shoulder
he
did
look
like
any
one
i
ever
seen
before
she
declared
he
was
tall
and
handsome
and
dressed
like
a
soldier
oh
surely
not
cora
answered
miss
allison
who
saw
that
some
of
the
little
girls
gathered
around
her
were
badly
frightened
that
be
you
know
the
cellar
is
quite
empty
give
me
the
candle
and
i
go
down
and
show
you
oh
no
please
auntie
do
go
down
cried
kitty
seeing
that
the
time
had
come
to
confess
it
is
just
a
joke
we
suppose
that
cora
would
be
scared
we
just
wanted
to
tease
her
because
she
seemed
so
sure
that
she
would
find
walter
down
there
go
and
bring
him
up
boys
ranald
and
rob
started
down
the
stairs
with
keith
carrying
a
candle
and
malcolm
calling
for
walter
to
come
on
and
help
carry
out
his
rival
the
four
boys
picking
up
the
dummy
as
if
it
had
been
a
real
man
carried
it
up
the
steps
and
laid
it
carefully
on
the
ground
so
comical
did
it
look
with
its
pudgy
pillow
face
that
everybody
laughed
except
cora
she
was
furiously
angry
and
not
all
kitty
penitent
speeches
or
the
boys
polite
apologies
could
appease
her
if
it
had
not
been
for
miss
allison
she
would
have
flounced
home
in
high
displeasure
but
she
as
usual
poured
oil
on
the
troubled
waters
and
talked
in
such
a
tactful
way
of
her
niece
many
pranks
that
there
was
no
resisting
such
an
appeal
she
allowed
herself
to
be
led
back
to
the
house
but
she
would
not
join
in
any
of
the
games
mom
beck
says
i
have
bad
luck
for
seven
years
because
i
broke
that
she
said
mournfully
oh
nonsense
exclaimed
miss
allison
do
give
it
another
thought
dear
it
is
only
an
old
negro
superstition
she
might
have
added
that
it
was
to
herself
and
brother
the
ill
luck
had
come
since
it
was
her
silver
mirror
that
was
broken
and
harry
rubber
boots
that
would
be
henceforth
useless
for
wading
because
of
the
holes
thoughtless
kitty
had
made
in
them
with
when
she
fastened
them
to
the
pillows
refreshments
were
served
soon
after
they
went
back
to
the
house
not
the
cakes
and
ices
that
usually
attended
parties
in
the
valley
but
things
suggestive
of
nuts
and
apples
doughnuts
and
molasses
candy
then
the
fate
cake
was
cut
and
everybody
took
a
slice
to
carry
home
to
dream
on
eat
it
the
last
thing
before
you
retire
said
miss
allison
then
walk
to
bed
backwards
without
taking
a
drink
of
water
or
speaking
another
word
it
is
so
salty
that
it
is
likely
you
will
dream
of
being
thirsty
and
of
somebody
bringing
you
water
they
say
if
you
dream
of
its
being
brought
in
a
golden
goblet
you
will
marry
into
wealth
if
in
a
tin
cup
poverty
will
be
your
lot
the
kind
of
vessel
you
see
in
your
dream
will
decide
your
fate
ah
walter
got
the
button
in
his
slice
that
means
he
will
be
an
old
bachelor
and
sew
his
own
buttons
on
all
his
life
anna
moore
got
the
dime
and
eliza
hughes
the
ring
which
foretold
that
she
would
be
the
first
one
in
the
company
to
have
a
wedding
the
thimble
fell
to
no
one
as
it
slipped
out
between
two
slices
in
the
cutting
that
means
none
of
us
will
be
old
maids
said
little
elise
miss
allison
slipped
it
on
kitty
finger
to
mend
your
mischievous
ways
with
she
said
and
everybody
who
had
enjoyed
the
laughed
the
moon
was
hiding
behind
a
cloud
when
at
last
the
merry
party
said
so
miss
allison
provided
each
little
group
with
a
to
light
them
on
their
homeward
way
as
the
grotesque
yellow
heads
with
their
grinning
went
bobbing
down
the
lonely
road
it
was
well
for
tam
that
he
need
not
pass
that
way
all
the
witches
of
allway
kirk
could
not
have
made
such
a
weird
procession
well
too
for
old
ichabod
crane
that
he
need
not
ride
that
night
through
the
shadowy
valley
one
pumpkin
in
the
hands
of
the
headless
rider
had
been
enough
to
banish
him
from
sleepy
hollow
for
ever
what
would
have
happened
no
one
can
tell
could
he
have
met
the
long
procession
of
bodiless
heads
that
straggled
through
the
gate
that
from
the
haunted
house
of
hartwell
hollow
chapter
xii
the
home
of
a
hero
with
november
came
heavier
frosts
and
the
first
light
snowfall
of
the
season
a
skim
of
ice
on
the
shorter
days
and
long
cheerful
evenings
around
the
library
fire
more
than
that
it
brought
the
end
of
the
extra
for
by
this
time
the
little
colonel
had
not
only
caught
up
with
her
classes
but
stood
at
the
head
of
most
of
them
i
think
she
deserves
a
reward
of
merit
said
papa
jack
when
she
came
home
one
day
proudly
bearing
a
record
of
perfect
recitations
for
a
week
and
so
it
came
about
that
the
next
friday
afternoon
she
had
a
reward
of
her
own
choosing
allison
kitty
and
elise
were
invited
out
to
stay
until
monday
so
for
two
happy
days
four
little
girls
raced
back
and
forth
under
the
bare
branches
of
the
locusts
where
usually
one
lonely
child
walked
to
and
fro
by
herself
and
because
the
daylight
did
not
last
half
long
enough
and
because
bedtime
seemed
to
come
hours
too
soon
they
were
invited
to
come
out
next
week
also
it
is
almost
like
having
betty
back
again
to
have
allison
lloyd
confided
to
her
mother
she
is
so
sensible
and
has
the
same
sweet
little
ways
that
betty
had
of
thinking
of
other
people
pleasure
first
sometimes
i
forget
and
call
her
betty
i
wish
they
could
all
come
out
again
next
week
have
you
looked
at
the
calendar
to
see
what
comes
next
week
lloyd
no
mothah
what
is
it
anybody
birthday
what
do
we
always
have
the
last
thursday
in
november
oh
thanksgiving
exclaimed
lloyd
joyfully
anothah
holiday
how
fast
they
come
usually
thanksgiving
was
made
a
great
occasion
at
locust
and
the
house
was
full
of
guests
but
this
year
sherman
was
obliged
to
be
in
new
york
all
week
and
the
old
colonel
was
in
virginia
lloyd
and
her
mother
were
planning
to
celebrate
alone
when
aunt
jane
sent
for
them
to
spend
the
thanksgiving
vacation
with
her
in
town
lloyd
never
enjoyed
her
visits
to
her
jane
the
house
was
too
big
and
solemn
with
its
dark
furniture
and
heavily
curtained
windows
the
chairs
were
all
so
tall
that
they
lifted
her
feet
high
above
the
floor
the
books
in
the
library
were
all
heavy
volumes
with
dull
hard
names
that
she
could
not
pronounce
the
tedious
hours
when
she
sat
in
the
invalid
dimly
lighted
room
and
listened
to
the
details
of
her
many
ailments
or
to
tales
of
people
whom
she
had
never
seen
seemed
endless
this
thanksgiving
day
it
was
unusually
cheerless
all
so
and
grumbly
thought
lloyd
seems
to
me
the
lesson
set
for
me
to
learn
on
every
holiday
is
patience
i
tiahed
of
being
patient
aunt
jane
had
her
thanksgiving
dinner
in
the
middle
of
the
day
much
turkey
and
made
lloyd
drowsy
and
the
hour
that
followed
was
a
stupid
one
she
sat
motionless
in
a
big
velvet
armchair
listening
to
more
of
aunt
jane
long
stories
of
unknown
people
now
and
then
she
stifled
a
yawn
wishing
with
all
her
heart
that
she
could
change
places
with
the
little
newsboy
calling
papers
in
the
street
below
the
window
or
with
the
dog
frisking
by
in
the
snow
she
fairly
ached
with
sitting
still
so
long
and
wondered
how
her
mother
could
be
so
interested
in
all
that
aunt
jane
was
telling
she
could
have
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
when
the
maid
broke
the
tediousness
of
the
hour
by
asking
sherman
to
step
out
into
the
hall
walton
wanted
to
speak
to
her
at
the
telephone
lloyd
slipped
from
her
chair
and
followed
her
mother
out
of
the
room
thankful
for
any
excuse
to
make
her
escape
she
wished
she
could
hear
what
walton
was
saying
instead
of
only
one
side
of
the
conversation
this
is
what
she
heard
her
mother
say
is
that
you
mary
yes
we
came
in
for
the
thanksgiving
holidays
and
expect
to
stay
until
saturday
afternoon
a
butterfly
carnival
how
lovely
no
i
could
possibly
leave
for
any
length
of
time
thank
you
aunt
jane
is
counting
on
my
staying
with
her
but
i
gladly
accept
for
lloyd
if
she
is
willing
to
stay
away
all
night
without
me
wait
a
moment
please
i
ask
her
lloyd
she
said
turning
from
the
instrument
walton
has
just
telephoned
me
that
you
are
included
in
the
invitation
that
anna
moore
has
given
the
girls
to
the
butterfly
carnival
at
the
opera
house
afternoon
it
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
free
kindergarten
in
which
moore
is
interested
and
she
has
taken
a
box
at
the
matinée
for
anna
and
her
friends
anna
is
going
to
give
a
butterfly
luncheon
just
before
the
performance
she
heard
that
you
were
in
town
and
thought
that
you
were
visiting
allison
so
she
called
at
to
invite
you
walton
has
asked
you
to
stay
all
night
with
the
girls
would
you
like
to
go
sherman
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
expression
of
delight
on
lloyd
face
as
she
began
noiselessly
clapping
her
hands
oh
if
it
would
be
rude
to
aunt
jane
she
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
i
just
i
so
glad
to
get
out
of
this
dismal
place
it
is
all
so
and
grumbly
heah
and
a
buttahfly
cahnival
has
such
a
delicious
sound
sherman
turned
to
the
receiver
again
and
lloyd
listened
eagerly
to
one
side
of
a
short
conversation
about
what
to
wear
and
when
to
go
then
sherman
hung
up
the
receiver
saying
allison
and
kitty
are
coming
for
you
they
will
start
on
the
next
car
i
ask
aunt
jane
to
send
the
man
over
with
your
clothes
in
a
little
while
and
i
call
in
the
morning
twenty
minutes
later
two
bright
faces
smiled
up
at
the
window
two
little
muffs
waved
an
excited
greeting
and
kitty
and
allison
ran
up
the
front
steps
to
meet
the
little
colonel
we
going
to
have
the
best
time
that
ever
was
cried
kitty
malcolm
and
keith
and
rob
are
invited
too
so
is
ranald
but
he
went
out
to
grandmother
directly
after
dinner
he
said
he
would
miss
the
good
times
he
have
in
the
country
for
forty
old
butterfly
carnivals
but
the
lunch
is
going
to
be
beautiful
and
it
will
be
so
nice
to
go
to
the
carnival
afterward
and
all
sit
in
the
same
box
sherman
watching
from
an
upper
window
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
as
she
saw
the
three
girls
going
gaily
down
the
street
together
she
knew
that
lloyd
vacation
time
could
not
fail
to
be
a
happy
one
if
spent
in
the
home
of
her
old
friend
mary
walton
i
feel
so
queah
said
the
little
colonel
as
she
followed
kitty
and
allison
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
to
their
rooms
it
is
just
as
if
some
one
had
waved
a
wand
and
said
change
only
half
an
hour
ago
i
was
in
a
big
dark
house
that
was
as
quiet
as
a
deaf
and
dumb
person
but
heah
it
seems
as
if
the
very
walls
were
talkin
and
i
ca
take
a
step
without
seeing
something
curious
i
am
sure
that
there
is
a
story
about
that
indian
tomahawk
and
on
the
wall
and
all
those
pretty
things
hanging
ovah
the
doah
there
is
answered
allison
pausing
to
point
over
the
bannister
to
the
curios
arranged
in
the
hall
below
papa
brought
them
back
from
that
indian
campaign
when
he
was
out
so
long
and
captured
that
dreadful
old
apache
chief
geronimo
the
things
in
that
other
corner
are
relics
of
the
cuban
war
and
the
other
things
are
from
the
philippines
lloyd
lingered
a
moment
on
the
stairs
leaning
over
the
bannister
to
peep
into
the
library
where
a
flag
a
portrait
and
a
sword
shrined
the
memory
of
one
of
the
nation
best
belovèd
it
was
only
a
glimpse
she
caught
but
with
it
came
the
impressive
thought
that
she
was
in
the
home
of
a
hero
and
a
queer
feeling
that
she
could
not
understand
surged
over
her
warm
and
tender
it
was
as
if
she
were
in
a
church
and
ought
to
tread
softly
and
move
reverently
in
such
a
presence
come
on
called
allison
throwing
open
the
door
into
her
room
how
different
this
is
from
the
cuckoo
nest
was
lloyd
next
thought
as
she
looked
about
the
interesting
room
filled
with
toys
and
souvenirs
from
all
parts
of
the
world
i
lots
rathah
look
at
these
things
than
play
she
said
when
a
choice
of
entertainment
was
offered
her
oh
what
a
darling
book
it
was
a
quaint
little
volume
of
japanese
fairy
tales
she
pounced
upon
printed
on
queer
crinkly
paper
with
pictures
of
amazing
dragons
and
brilliant
birds
such
as
only
the
japanese
artists
can
paint
but
before
she
could
examine
that
kitty
had
brought
her
a
jinrikisha
and
allison
a
toy
filipino
bed
elise
marshalled
out
a
whole
colony
of
dolls
from
spanish
soldiers
to
esquimaux
babies
each
brought
out
her
special
treasures
and
all
talked
at
once
they
piled
the
floor
around
her
with
interesting
things
they
filled
her
lap
they
covered
the
chairs
and
tables
and
for
every
article
there
was
an
interesting
tale
of
the
time
or
place
where
it
had
come
into
their
possession
outside
the
snow
began
to
fall
again
the
electric
cars
passed
and
repassed
with
whirr
and
rush
and
clang
the
short
winter
day
ended
in
sudden
dusk
and
the
maid
came
in
to
light
the
gas
why
how
could
it
get
dark
so
soon
exclaimed
lloyd
looking
up
in
surprise
as
she
suddenly
realised
that
it
was
night
it
does
seem
to
me
that
i
have
been
heah
any
time
at
all
i
have
enjoyed
it
so
much
after
the
big
thanksgiving
dinner
nobody
was
very
hungry
but
they
all
followed
walton
down
to
the
for
a
light
lunch
here
lloyd
found
herself
in
another
of
interesting
things
she
could
not
turn
her
head
without
a
glimpse
of
something
to
arouse
her
curiosity
the
quaint
chinese
ladle
on
the
sideboard
the
gay
procession
of
elephants
and
peacocks
around
the
border
of
the
the
old
army
chest
the
silver
candlesticks
that
had
lighted
the
devotions
of
many
a
spanish
friar
in
the
gray
monasteries
of
cuba
and
the
exquisite
needlework
of
the
nuns
of
luzon
walton
was
the
now
and
lloyd
listened
with
an
intense
eagerness
that
made
her
dark
eyes
grow
more
starlike
than
ever
and
brought
the
delicate
pink
flushing
up
into
her
cheeks
seeing
what
pleasure
it
was
giving
her
little
guest
walton
took
her
into
the
library
afterward
and
opened
the
cabinets
pointing
out
one
object
of
interest
after
another
but
the
things
that
pleased
lloyd
most
were
the
bells
in
the
hall
near
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
an
oaken
frame
placed
there
for
the
purpose
swung
three
spanish
bells
that
had
been
presented
to
walton
as
trophies
of
war
they
had
been
taken
from
different
church
towers
on
the
island
of
luzon
by
the
filipino
insurgents
when
they
were
sacking
the
villages
and
taking
everything
before
them
these
bells
had
been
captured
from
the
insurgents
by
the
soldiers
of
the
general
division
a
thrill
went
through
the
little
colonel
as
walton
told
her
their
history
and
swung
one
of
the
great
iron
tongues
back
and
forth
till
the
hall
echoed
with
the
clear
ringing
several
times
during
the
evening
lloyd
slipped
out
into
the
hall
again
to
stand
before
these
mute
witnesses
of
the
ravages
of
war
and
tap
the
rims
with
light
finger
tips
she
tapped
so
lightly
that
only
the
faintest
echo
sounded
in
the
hall
but
from
her
rapt
face
walton
knew
that
the
note
awakened
other
voices
in
the
little
imagination
she
had
known
lloyd
ever
since
she
had
gone
to
live
at
locust
and
she
remembered
the
child
quaint
habit
of
singing
to
herself
all
the
words
that
pleased
her
fancy
she
strung
together
on
the
thread
of
a
soft
minor
tune
in
a
crooning
little
melody
of
her
own
oh
the
buttercups
an
daisies
she
had
heard
her
sing
one
time
standing
in
a
field
of
nodding
bloom
oh
the
buttercups
an
daisies
all
white
an
gold
an
yellow
they
all
at
me
all
howdy
howdy
and
another
time
when
the
august
lilies
standing
white
and
waxen
in
the
moonlight
had
moved
the
old
colonel
to
speak
tenderly
of
the
wife
of
his
youth
walton
had
seen
a
smile
cross
his
face
when
the
baby
voice
unconscious
of
an
audience
crooned
softly
from
the
doorstep
oh
the
an
the
stars
through
them
an
the
moonlight
an
the
lilies
an
amanthis
an
amanthis
now
curious
to
know
what
thoughts
the
bells
were
awakening
walton
bent
her
head
to
listen
as
the
little
colonel
chanted
to
herself
in
a
oh
the
bells
the
bells
and
the
tales
they
ring
for
evah
of
the
an
victory
an
their
hero
their
hero
the
tears
sprang
to
walton
eyes
as
she
listened
to
the
interpretation
of
the
voices
of
the
bells
and
presently
when
she
looked
up
and
saw
lloyd
standing
in
front
of
the
general
portrait
gazing
reverently
into
the
brave
calm
face
she
crossed
the
room
and
put
an
arm
around
her
do
you
know
said
the
little
colonel
in
a
confiding
undertone
when
i
look
up
at
that
i
know
just
how
betty
feels
when
she
writes
poetry
she
heahs
voices
inside
and
thinks
things
too
beautiful
to
find
words
for
there
something
in
his
face
and
about
that
sword
that
he
used
for
his
country
and
the
flag
that
he
followed
and
the
bells
that
ring
for
his
memory
that
make
me
want
to
cry
and
yet
there
a
glad
proud
feelin
in
my
heart
because
he
was
so
brave
as
if
he
sort
of
belonged
to
me
too
it
makes
me
wish
i
could
be
a
man
and
go
out
and
do
something
brave
and
grand
what
do
you
suppose
makes
me
feel
both
ways
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
part
of
patriotism
said
walton
with
a
caressing
hand
on
her
hair
i
did
know
i
had
any
said
lloyd
seriously
looking
up
with
wondering
eyes
i
always
took
grandfathah
side
you
know
because
the
yankees
shot
his
arm
off
i
hated
for
it
and
i
nevah
would
hurrah
for
the
union
i
despised
republicans
and
the
nawth
from
the
time
i
could
talk
do
say
that
lloyd
said
walton
still
caressing
her
soft
hair
what
have
we
to
do
with
that
old
quarrel
its
time
has
long
gone
by
i
too
am
a
daughter
of
the
south
lloyd
but
surely
such
lives
as
his
have
not
been
sacrificed
in
vain
she
pointed
impressively
to
the
portrait
that
if
nothing
else
would
make
me
want
to
forget
that
north
and
south
had
ever
been
arrayed
against
each
other
surely
such
lives
as
his
by
their
high
loyalty
should
inspire
a
love
of
country
deep
enough
to
make
america
the
guiding
star
of
the
nations
bedtime
came
long
before
lloyd
was
ready
for
it
do
you
want
to
tell
your
mother
good
night
asked
walton
stopping
at
the
telephone
as
they
passed
through
the
upper
hall
oh
yes
cried
lloyd
how
different
it
is
from
the
cuckoo
nest
you
ca
get
homesick
when
you
know
you
at
one
end
of
a
wiah
and
mothah
is
at
the
othah
walton
called
up
aunt
jane
number
and
putting
the
receiver
into
lloyd
hand
passed
on
into
her
room
oh
mothah
allison
heard
her
say
it
like
livin
in
that
fairy
tale
where
everything
in
the
picture
was
made
alive
do
you
remembah
the
birds
sang
and
the
fishes
swam
and
the
rivah
ran
everything
in
the
picture
acted
as
if
it
were
alive
and
out
of
its
frame
everything
in
the
house
talks
for
it
has
a
story
of
its
own
all
the
family
have
been
tellin
me
stories
and
i
had
a
lovely
thanksgiving
day
there
was
a
long
pause
while
sherman
answered
then
allison
heard
lloyd
voice
again
the
lesson
is
a
beautiful
one
this
time
it
is
patience
any
moah
it
is
good
night
can
you
catch
a
kiss
heah
it
is
allison
heard
the
noise
of
her
lips
and
then
a
laughing
good
night
as
she
hung
up
the
receiver
they
often
had
what
they
called
parties
at
the
waltons
and
they
had
one
that
night
when
they
were
all
ready
for
bed
the
little
group
of
figures
gathered
on
the
hearth
rug
at
feet
counting
their
causes
for
thankfulness
and
chattering
sociably
of
many
things
presently
across
the
merry
conversation
fell
a
recollection
that
rested
on
lloyd
mind
like
a
shadow
she
remembered
molly
in
her
bare
little
bedroom
over
the
kitchen
at
the
cuckoo
nest
poor
little
molly
who
could
never
know
a
happy
thanksgiving
so
long
as
dot
was
away
from
her
here
was
shelter
and
and
but
molly
had
none
of
the
latter
to
be
thankful
for
lloyd
could
not
drive
away
the
thought
and
when
there
came
a
pause
in
the
conversation
she
began
telling
molly
story
to
her
interested
listeners
it
had
the
same
effect
on
them
that
it
had
on
joyce
and
eugenia
and
presently
allison
slipped
down
to
the
library
to
bring
up
a
volume
of
bound
magazines
that
the
girls
might
see
the
picture
that
reminded
molly
of
dot
the
grief
of
the
poor
little
waif
seemed
very
real
to
elise
who
hung
over
the
picture
calling
attention
to
every
detail
of
the
shabby
room
look
at
the
old
broken
stool
she
said
and
her
thin
little
arms
and
her
shoes
are
all
worn
out
too
i
wish
she
had
a
pair
of
mine
long
after
she
was
tucked
away
in
her
little
white
bed
she
called
out
through
the
darkness
mamma
do
you
dot
knows
how
to
say
her
prayers
i
do
know
darling
came
the
answer
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
she
had
any
one
to
teach
her
there
was
a
pause
then
another
whispered
call
mamma
do
you
it
would
do
any
good
if
i
say
them
for
her
yes
love
i
am
sure
it
would
there
was
a
rustling
of
bedclothes
two
bare
feet
struck
the
floor
and
elise
knelt
down
in
the
dark
saying
softly
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
i
pray
thee
lord
her
soul
to
keep
if
she
should
die
before
i
wake
i
pray
thee
lord
my
soul
to
take
please
god
help
poor
little
lost
dot
to
get
back
to
her
sister
amen
there
i
guess
he
know
even
if
it
did
sound
sort
of
mixed
up
she
said
climbing
back
to
bed
with
a
sigh
of
mingled
relief
and
satisfaction
that
the
kind
he
loves
best
little
one
said
her
mother
coming
into
the
room
to
tuck
her
in
once
more
it
does
make
any
difference
about
the
pronouns
the
more
we
mix
our
neighbours
with
ourselves
in
our
prayers
the
better
he
is
pleased
chapter
xiii
the
day
after
thanksgiving
there
you
are
ready
at
last
said
sherman
as
she
finished
buttoning
lloyd
gloves
and
fastened
the
jewelled
clasp
of
her
long
party
cloak
she
had
come
over
to
help
the
little
colonel
dress
for
the
butterfly
luncheon
at
anna
moore
feeling
very
elegant
in
her
unusual
party
array
lloyd
surveyed
herself
in
the
mirror
with
a
satisfied
air
and
sat
down
beside
allison
to
wait
for
the
carriage
that
moore
had
promised
to
send
for
them
walton
was
tying
kitty
sash
and
in
the
next
room
elise
was
buzzing
around
like
an
excited
little
bee
hold
still
do
now
they
heard
milly
say
impatiently
i
never
get
the
tangles
brushed
out
of
your
curls
and
the
others
will
go
off
and
leave
you
and
you
have
to
miss
the
party
presently
there
was
a
long
protesting
wail
from
elise
oh
milly
what
did
you
put
that
ribbon
on
my
hair
for
it
is
pink
enough
to
match
my
stockings
there
scarcely
any
difference
at
all
in
the
shades
answered
milly
sure
it
would
take
a
microscope
to
tell
even
if
they
were
side
by
side
and
your
head
is
too
far
away
from
your
heels
for
anybody
to
notice
oh
but
it
wo
do
at
all
cried
elise
breaking
away
from
her
to
run
into
the
next
room
see
mamma
they
do
match
in
her
eagerness
elise
leaned
over
bending
herself
like
a
little
acrobat
till
the
pink
bow
on
her
hair
was
on
a
level
with
the
pink
silk
stockings
there
barely
a
shade
difference
laughed
walton
the
difference
is
so
slight
that
nobody
will
notice
it
unless
you
expect
to
double
up
occasionally
like
a
and
call
attention
to
it
of
course
i
do
expect
to
do
that
said
elise
with
such
a
funny
little
air
of
injured
dignity
that
her
mother
caught
her
up
with
a
hasty
kiss
you
a
dear
little
peacock
even
if
you
do
think
too
much
of
your
fine
feathers
but
you
ca
stop
to
make
a
fuss
about
your
ribbons
now
it
would
be
making
a
mountain
out
of
a
run
back
to
milly
for
your
hat
i
hear
the
carriage
stopping
out
in
front
what
a
lot
of
things
i
have
to
write
about
in
my
next
letter
to
the
girls
thought
lloyd
as
they
rolled
along
in
the
carriage
a
few
minutes
later
joyce
and
betty
will
like
to
hear
about
the
home
and
all
the
interesting
things
in
it
and
eugenia
will
enjoy
this
part
of
my
visit
most
illustration
the
butterfly
carnival
it
was
with
a
view
to
impressing
eugenia
with
the
elegance
of
her
friends
that
lloyd
noticed
every
detail
of
the
beautiful
luncheon
she
intended
that
eugenia
should
hear
about
it
all
gay
butterflies
so
lifelike
that
one
could
not
believe
that
human
hands
had
made
them
were
poised
everywhere
on
the
flowers
the
the
curtains
the
menu
cards
were
decorated
with
them
the
fine
china
bore
swarms
of
them
around
their
dainty
rims
and
even
the
ices
were
moulded
to
represent
them
the
little
hostess
herself
fluttering
around
among
her
guests
as
gracefully
as
if
she
too
were
a
winged
creature
wore
a
gauzy
dress
of
palest
blue
embroidered
in
butterflies
and
there
were
butterflies
caught
here
and
there
in
her
golden
curls
the
little
colonel
could
scarcely
eat
for
admiring
her
she
felt
very
elegant
and
grown
up
to
be
the
guest
at
such
an
entertainment
and
as
she
took
her
place
at
the
table
between
malcolm
and
rob
she
wished
with
all
her
heart
that
eugenia
could
peep
in
and
see
her
it
was
time
to
start
to
the
butterfly
carnival
almost
immediately
when
luncheon
was
over
and
again
lloyd
felt
very
elegant
and
grown
up
rolling
along
in
the
carriage
to
the
matinee
moore
ushered
the
party
into
the
box
she
had
taken
for
anna
and
her
little
friends
and
more
than
one
person
in
the
audience
turned
to
ask
his
neighbour
who
are
those
lovely
children
did
you
ever
see
such
handsome
boys
they
have
such
charming
manners
it
is
like
a
scene
from
some
old
the
little
colonel
sitting
beside
anna
with
the
two
little
knights
leaning
forward
to
talk
to
her
to
pick
up
her
fan
or
adjust
her
lorgnette
was
all
unconscious
that
any
one
in
the
audience
was
watching
her
admiringly
but
she
wished
again
that
eugenia
could
see
her
when
the
curtain
went
up
the
scene
on
the
stage
was
so
absorbing
that
she
forgot
eugenia
she
forgot
where
she
was
for
the
play
carried
her
bodily
into
the
queen
of
the
fairies
was
there
with
her
wand
and
all
her
spangled
court
and
lloyd
looked
and
listened
with
breathless
attention
while
the
naughty
puck
played
pranks
on
all
the
butterflies
and
finally
catching
them
at
play
in
a
moonlighted
forest
took
all
the
creatures
captive
it
was
as
entrancing
as
looking
into
a
living
fairy
tale
and
when
at
last
the
queen
released
the
prisoners
with
a
wave
of
her
wand
and
to
the
soft
notes
of
the
violins
the
butterflies
danced
off
the
stage
lloyd
drew
a
long
breath
and
came
down
to
earth
with
a
sigh
she
could
have
listened
gladly
for
hours
more
but
the
curtain
was
down
the
people
were
rising
all
over
the
house
and
keith
was
holding
her
party
cloak
for
her
to
slip
into
moore
turned
to
allison
elise
is
wild
to
see
behind
the
scenes
she
said
i
am
going
to
keep
her
with
me
a
little
while
your
cousin
malcolm
says
that
he
and
keith
can
take
you
home
in
their
carriage
with
lloyd
and
kitty
so
i
send
anna
and
rob
home
in
mine
and
wait
here
until
it
comes
back
tell
your
mother
i
take
good
care
of
elise
and
bring
her
home
as
soon
as
i
attend
to
my
little
protegés
behind
the
scene
many
of
the
children
who
had
taken
part
in
the
performance
were
from
the
free
kindergarten
and
elise
holding
fast
to
moore
hand
watched
the
transformation
behind
the
scenes
from
gauzy
wings
to
gingham
gowns
with
wondering
eyes
it
is
like
when
cinderella
lost
her
glass
slipper
she
said
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
her
silks
turned
to
rags
all
the
glitter
and
glory
of
had
disappeared
with
the
footlights
in
the
wintry
light
of
the
late
afternoon
some
of
the
faces
were
pitifully
thin
and
wan
here
are
three
little
butterflies
that
must
go
back
home
and
be
grubs
again
said
moore
as
she
beckoned
to
the
children
whom
she
had
promised
to
take
home
in
her
carriage
elise
looked
at
them
wondering
if
it
could
be
possible
that
they
were
the
same
children
who
fifteen
minutes
before
had
looked
so
radiantly
beautiful
in
their
spangled
costumes
on
the
stage
they
were
shy
little
things
who
could
scarcely
find
words
to
answer
moore
questions
but
they
seemed
to
enjoy
the
drive
in
the
warm
closed
carriage
behind
the
team
of
prancing
bays
elise
chatted
on
gaily
telling
moore
how
much
she
had
enjoyed
the
carnival
how
she
had
admired
the
fairy
queen
and
how
she
longed
for
a
real
live
fairy
she
had
looked
for
them
often
in
the
and
the
if
she
could
find
one
maybe
it
would
tell
her
where
to
look
for
dot
presently
they
turned
into
a
side
street
among
unfamiliar
and
paused
at
an
alley
entrance
i
am
going
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
with
the
children
said
moore
preparing
to
step
out
of
the
carriage
i
want
to
inquire
about
the
baby
who
is
sick
i
be
back
in
a
moment
elise
as
the
carriage
door
closed
behind
her
she
spoke
to
the
coachman
wait
here
a
moment
dickson
the
man
on
the
box
touched
his
hat
and
then
turned
his
fur
collar
higher
around
his
ears
there
was
a
cold
wind
whistling
through
the
alley
elise
pressed
her
face
against
the
glass
and
looked
out
into
the
wintry
street
moore
moment
stretched
out
into
five
the
baby
was
worse
and
she
was
making
a
list
of
the
many
things
it
needed
for
its
comfort
there
was
little
of
interest
to
watch
from
the
carriage
window
few
people
were
passing
along
the
narrow
pavement
and
elise
wondered
impatiently
why
moore
did
not
come
presently
down
the
street
came
a
ragged
child
with
its
arm
held
up
over
its
eyes
sobbing
and
sniffling
as
it
shuffled
along
in
a
pair
of
wornout
shoes
many
sizes
too
large
for
its
little
feet
elise
heart
gave
a
great
thump
and
she
started
forward
eagerly
molly
little
lost
sister
she
exclaimed
aloud
it
must
be
for
she
looks
just
like
the
girl
in
the
picture
oh
i
must
call
her
she
was
fumbling
at
the
knob
of
the
carriage
door
but
before
she
could
get
it
open
the
child
turned
and
started
up
the
dirty
alley
still
sobbing
aloud
with
her
arm
over
her
face
oh
i
must
call
her
back
thought
elise
everybody
will
be
so
glad
if
she
is
found
i
must
let
her
get
away
it
took
all
her
strength
to
turn
the
knob
but
with
another
desperate
wrench
she
got
the
door
open
and
climbed
out
to
the
pavement
the
coachman
half
asleep
in
his
great
fur
collar
and
heavy
did
not
hear
the
tap
of
the
little
pink
boots
as
she
ran
up
the
dark
alley
between
the
high
rickety
buildings
with
their
bad
smells
and
dirty
sewers
oh
she
is
going
so
fast
panted
elise
i
never
catch
up
with
her
the
pretty
pink
boots
were
wet
and
snowy
now
the
silk
stockings
splashed
with
muddy
water
her
big
velvet
hat
was
tipped
over
one
eye
and
her
curls
were
blowing
in
tangles
over
the
wide
collar
of
her
cloak
but
forgetting
all
about
her
fine
feathers
she
ran
on
around
corners
into
strange
passages
across
unfamiliar
streets
following
the
flutter
of
a
tattered
gown
all
of
a
sudden
she
paused
looking
around
in
bewilderment
the
child
she
was
following
had
disappeared
with
a
bitter
sense
of
disappointment
swelling
in
her
little
heart
she
turned
to
go
back
to
the
carriage
and
then
stood
still
in
bewilderment
she
could
not
tell
which
way
she
had
come
she
was
lost
herself
for
a
few
minutes
the
little
pink
boots
trudged
bravely
on
then
the
tears
began
to
gather
in
her
big
black
eyes
they
feel
so
bad
at
home
she
thought
when
they
hunt
and
hunt
and
ca
find
me
anywhere
oh
what
if
i
stay
lost
and
get
to
look
all
ragged
and
dirty
like
dot
and
just
have
to
stand
in
a
corner
and
cry
if
there
was
any
nice
stores
along
here
i
go
in
and
ask
the
man
to
send
me
home
but
these
places
look
so
dreadful
i
afraid
she
was
in
a
disreputable
part
of
the
town
where
clothing
stores
and
were
crowded
in
between
saloons
and
cheap
restaurants
and
she
dared
not
venture
into
any
of
them
to
ask
for
help
little
as
she
was
she
felt
that
she
was
safer
on
the
streets
than
inside
those
crowded
dirty
quarters
where
negroes
and
coarse
brawling
white
men
quarrelled
and
swore
in
loud
tones
it
the
saloons
that
brought
all
the
trouble
to
molly
and
dot
thought
elise
shrinking
away
from
a
group
of
noisy
loafers
as
they
straggled
out
of
one
they
made
their
father
mean
and
their
mother
die
and
their
grandmother
go
crazy
and
them
lose
each
other
they
worse
than
wild
beasts
and
i
afraid
of
maybe
if
i
walk
far
enough
come
to
a
nice
policeman
but
i
so
tired
now
her
lip
quivered
as
she
whispered
the
words
oh
it
seems
as
if
i
drop
and
i
so
cold
i
am
nearly
frozen
as
she
walked
on
across
her
way
an
electric
arch
suddenly
shot
its
cold
white
light
into
the
street
then
another
and
another
appeared
and
as
far
as
she
could
see
in
any
direction
the
streets
were
brilliantly
illuminated
oh
it
night
she
sobbed
i
freeze
to
death
before
morning
if
somebody
does
come
and
find
me
still
she
dragged
on
growing
more
tired
and
frightened
at
every
step
until
she
could
walk
no
longer
at
the
end
of
a
long
block
she
sat
down
on
a
doorstep
and
huddled
up
in
one
corner
out
of
the
wind
a
dismal
picture
came
to
her
mind
of
the
little
in
hans
fairy
tales
the
little
who
had
frozen
to
death
on
christmas
eve
on
the
threshold
of
somebody
happy
home
she
had
a
box
of
matches
to
warm
herself
with
sobbed
elise
i
have
even
that
oh
it
awful
to
be
lost
with
the
tears
trickling
down
her
face
she
pictured
to
herself
the
grief
of
the
family
in
case
they
should
never
find
her
mamma
will
stand
in
the
door
and
look
out
into
the
dark
and
call
and
call
but
her
little
elise
will
never
answer
and
allison
and
kitty
will
feel
so
bad
that
they
wo
want
to
play
they
divide
my
things
between
them
to
remember
me
by
and
for
a
long
time
it
make
them
cry
whenever
they
see
my
dolls
and
books
or
my
place
at
the
table
or
my
little
wicker
chair
in
the
library
that
i
never
sit
in
any
more
ranald
wo
cry
he
a
captain
and
he
brave
but
he
be
just
as
sorry
oh
i
wish
ranald
was
out
in
the
country
he
could
find
me
if
he
was
at
home
it
was
growing
colder
and
colder
on
the
doorstep
the
child
teeth
chattered
and
her
lips
were
blue
still
she
sat
there
until
an
man
in
the
next
house
slouched
out
on
to
the
street
with
a
lean
spotted
dog
at
his
heels
suddenly
for
no
reason
that
elise
could
discover
for
she
did
not
know
that
he
was
half
drunk
he
turned
and
kicked
the
poor
beast
cursing
it
violently
it
shrank
away
yelping
with
pain
seeing
that
the
man
was
coming
toward
her
elise
sprang
up
in
terror
and
with
one
frightened
glance
over
her
shoulder
darted
around
the
corner
once
out
of
his
sight
she
stopped
running
but
fear
kept
her
moving
and
she
walked
wearily
on
and
on
every
step
carried
her
farther
away
from
home
through
unwashed
windows
she
could
see
the
yellow
lamplight
streaming
over
dingy
rooms
most
of
the
sights
were
unattractive
but
in
one
house
cleaner
than
the
rest
she
saw
a
crowd
of
clamouring
children
seated
around
a
all
reaching
their
spoons
and
plates
toward
a
big
steaming
platter
in
the
middle
it
reminded
her
that
she
was
hungry
herself
and
she
lingered
a
moment
looking
wistfully
in
at
the
cheerful
scene
then
on
she
started
again
once
she
stumbled
and
fell
in
the
slush
of
a
snowy
crossing
but
scrambled
bravely
up
again
walking
on
and
on
meanwhile
allison
kitty
and
the
little
colonel
who
had
gone
ahead
in
the
carriage
with
the
boys
had
stopped
at
klein
for
a
box
of
candy
and
at
a
book
store
for
a
dissected
game
they
had
been
discussing
at
the
luncheon
when
they
reached
walton
malcolm
sent
the
carriage
home
and
both
the
boys
went
into
the
house
with
the
girls
tell
mamma
we
come
in
a
few
minutes
and
tell
her
all
about
the
carnival
said
allison
to
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
the
five
children
went
into
the
library
with
their
candy
and
game
and
walton
busy
with
many
letters
did
not
notice
how
allison
few
minutes
lengthened
out
until
it
grew
so
dark
that
she
had
to
lay
down
her
pen
as
she
did
so
a
carriage
drove
rapidly
up
to
the
house
moore
hurried
up
the
steps
and
there
was
a
hasty
dialogue
at
the
door
between
her
and
allison
walton
did
not
hear
the
frightened
cry
oh
mamma
elise
is
lost
that
went
up
from
allison
and
impetuous
kitty
hearing
no
answer
and
feeling
that
she
must
summon
help
in
some
way
began
beating
madly
on
the
bells
of
luzon
as
if
she
were
trying
to
call
out
the
whole
fire
department
as
the
clangour
startled
her
walton
first
thought
was
that
the
house
must
be
on
fire
and
she
hurried
out
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
looked
over
the
bannister
kitty
was
still
beating
on
the
bells
with
an
umbrella
that
she
had
snatched
from
the
rack
stop
kitty
she
called
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
elise
is
lost
repeated
allison
and
walton
with
a
white
face
hurried
down
to
hear
moore
explanation
she
had
been
detained
some
time
in
the
listening
to
the
tale
of
woe
that
the
sick
baby
mother
poured
out
to
her
but
she
had
felt
no
uneasiness
about
elise
knowing
that
the
in
the
carriage
would
keep
her
warm
and
comfortable
when
she
came
down
to
her
utter
amazement
the
carriage
door
stood
open
and
the
child
was
gone
the
sleepy
coachman
who
roused
himself
from
his
cold
doze
when
he
heard
her
coming
was
as
surprised
as
she
and
declared
he
had
not
heard
the
carriage
door
open
or
the
child
slip
out
he
had
no
idea
what
could
have
become
of
her
they
made
inquiries
of
people
all
along
the
block
but
nobody
had
seen
a
child
answering
to
the
description
of
elise
then
moore
thought
that
the
child
must
have
grown
tired
of
waiting
and
for
some
reason
had
started
to
walk
home
she
had
driven
out
to
the
house
with
the
hope
that
she
might
find
her
there
or
might
overtake
her
on
the
way
walton
acted
quickly
telephone
to
your
father
malcolm
she
cried
and
to
the
police
station
oh
my
poor
baby
out
in
the
cold
streets
with
night
coming
on
i
must
look
for
her
without
losing
a
minute
she
started
up
the
stairs
to
call
milly
to
help
her
dress
for
the
search
get
my
furs
she
called
and
my
heaviest
coat
it
will
be
a
cold
night
but
malcolm
stopped
her
do
go
aunt
mary
he
cried
papa
is
on
his
way
here
now
and
we
boys
will
go
in
your
place
the
policemen
are
being
notified
all
over
the
city
and
it
will
do
more
good
for
you
to
stay
here
ready
to
answer
any
questions
that
may
come
i
wait
until
macintyre
comes
said
moore
so
that
i
can
take
him
straight
back
to
that
tenement
district
if
he
thinks
best
to
go
while
they
were
still
standing
an
anxious
little
group
in
the
hall
macintyre
came
in
and
after
a
hurried
consultation
he
and
moore
drove
in
one
direction
and
the
boys
started
in
another
none
of
them
like
to
remember
the
three
hours
that
followed
the
news
spread
like
and
the
telephone
bell
rang
constantly
with
friendly
messages
each
time
they
hoped
that
some
one
of
the
searching
party
was
calling
them
up
but
each
time
they
were
disappointed
at
intervals
one
of
the
girls
stole
to
the
front
door
to
look
out
into
the
night
and
listen
every
voice
made
them
start
every
footstep
every
roll
of
carriage
wheels
along
the
avenue
made
them
hold
their
breath
in
suspense
until
it
had
passed
presently
kitty
leaving
her
mother
at
the
telephone
and
allison
and
lloyd
on
the
stairs
strolled
down
to
the
kitchen
where
milly
and
the
cook
were
talking
about
charlie
ross
and
all
the
children
they
had
ever
heard
of
who
had
mysteriously
disappeared
from
home
an
it
just

the

it

a
sorry
day
for
this
house
if
they
niver
coom
walking
into
it
again
kitty
stole
out
of
the
kitchen
cold
with
this
new
horror
and
went
back
to
whisper
it
to
allison
and
lloyd
as
they
sat
on
the
stairs
ready
to
spring
forward
at
the
first
sound
of
coming
footsteps
now
if
it
had
been
allison
who
was
lost
thought
walton
she
could
have
found
her
way
home
without
any
difficulty
she
is
such
a
sensible
womanly
child
always
to
be
trusted
for
doing
the
right
thing
in
the
right
place
kitty
might
not
act
so
wisely
but
she
would
bang
ahead
and
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
she
is
the
kind
one
might
expect
to
see
come
home
in
almost
any
style
from
a
coal
cart
to
a
triumphal
car
but
my
baby
elise
is
so
little
and
so
timid
my
heart
aches
for
her
she
will
be
so
sorely
frightened
dinner
was
put
on
the
table
and
carried
out
again
nobody
could
eat
and
as
the
moments
dragged
by
the
girls
still
sat
on
the
stairs
and
the
anxious
mother
sprang
to
the
telephone
at
every
tinkle
of
the
bell
praying
for
a
hopeful
message
from
the
elise
stumbling
on
down
strange
streets
exhausted
hungry
and
cold
stopped
on
a
street
corner
and
looked
around
her
she
had
strayed
down
among
the
warehouses
now
and
the
little
feet
numb
with
cold
were
too
tired
to
go
much
farther
down
here
few
people
were
passing
a
big
tobacco
warehouse
looming
up
tall
and
dark
above
her
made
her
feel
so
tiny
and
lost
that
the
last
bit
of
her
courage
ebbed
away
and
she
began
to
sob
aloud
out
of
the
shadow
just
ahead
a
man
was
coming
toward
her
so
tall
and
he
looked
that
he
seemed
a
giant
to
her
terrified
eyes
she
put
her
little
gloved
hands
over
her
eyes
to
shut
out
the
sight
and
crouched
close
against
the
wall
her
baby
heart
fluttering
like
a
frightened
bird
on
he
came
with
slow
heavy
tread
his
footsteps
ringing
through
the
silent
street
with
a
strange
metallic
echo
as
he
passed
out
from
the
black
shadow
of
the
warehouse
into
the
light
of
the
elise
peeped
between
her
fingers
again
and
then
smiled
through
her
tears
it
was
a
big
burly
policeman
the
next
instant
she
was
running
toward
him
calling
oh
mister
policeman
i
lost
take
me
home
it
was
a
safe
haven
she
had
run
into
the
policeman
had
just
come
from
home
to
go
on
his
beat
and
in
a
little
cottage
not
many
blocks
away
were
three
children
who
were
still
in
his
thoughts
they
had
followed
him
to
the
door
to
swarm
over
him
and
kiss
him
and
had
called
after
him
down
the
snowy
street
good
night
daddy
the
childish
voices
were
still
ringing
in
his
ears
as
tenderly
as
if
she
had
been
one
of
his
own
he
lifted
elise
in
his
strong
fatherly
arms
wiped
her
face
and
began
to
question
her
she
told
him
her
name
but
in
her
confusion
could
not
remember
the
name
of
the
street
where
she
lived
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
moment
to
carry
her
into
a
around
the
corner
ring
up
headquarters
and
report
his
discovery
and
it
was
only
a
few
moments
after
that
until
they
were
on
an
electric
car
homeward
bound
elise
was
not
the
first
lost
child
the
big
policeman
had
taken
home
but
he
had
never
had
such
a
royal
welcome
as
the
one
that
awaited
him
in
the
hall
when
the
joyful
family
met
him
he
glanced
around
him
curiously
seeing
on
every
side
the
relics
of
victorious
the
grim
weapons
of
warfare
that
stood
as
mute
witnesses
of
a
brave
soldier
life
beyond
in
the
library
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
portrait
the
flag
and
the
sword
and
then
suddenly
realised
in
whose
presence
he
stood
do
mention
it
madam
he
said
awkwardly
as
the
grateful
mother
tried
to
express
her
thanks
do
you
know
that
this
is
about
the
proudest
moment
of
my
life
to
know
that
it
was
little
one
i
found
and
brought
back
with
her
arms
around
my
neck
i
read
everything
there
was
about
him
in
the
papers
he
nodded
toward
the
portrait
and
i
always
did
say
he
was
exactly
my
idea
of
a
hero
but
i
never
thought
the
day
would
come
when
i
stand
in
his
house
and
see
all
the
things
he
touched
and
looked
at
that
the
way
everybody
seems
to
feel
about
the
general
thought
the
little
colonel
glancing
from
the
policeman
to
the
portrait
it
grand
to
be
a
hero
elise
was
too
tired
and
sleepy
to
talk
about
her
adventures
that
night
and
asked
to
be
put
to
bed
as
soon
as
she
had
had
the
bowl
of
oyster
soup
that
was
being
kept
hot
for
her
when
the
cook
brought
it
in
loudly
blessing
all
the
saints
in
the
calendar
that
the
child
had
been
found
all
the
family
remembered
that
they
were
hungry
and
the
long
delayed
dinner
was
brought
on
again
elise
fell
asleep
at
the
table
before
she
finished
the
soup
but
she
opened
her
drowsy
eyes
as
they
were
carrying
her
away
to
bed
to
say
you
all
wo
feel
very
bad
will
you
if
i
give
you
just
a
teenty
weenty
christmas
present
this
year
i
want
to
save
most
of
my
money
to
buy
something
nice
for
that
big
policeman
that
brought
me
home
being
found
is
the
very
best
thing
in
all
the
world
and
i
would
have
been
lost
yet
if
it
had
been
for
him
chapter
xiv
lloyd
makes
a
discovery
it
molly
little
lost
sister
i
sure
of
it
insisted
elise
next
morning
stopping
in
the
middle
of
her
dressing
to
argue
the
matter
with
lloyd
and
allison
of
course
i
could
see
her
face
for
she
had
her
apron
up
over
it
crying
but
neither
can
you
see
the
little
face
in
the
picture
allison
walton
and
the
rest
of
her
was
exactly
like
the
picture
see
she
ran
across
the
room
for
the
magazine
that
had
been
brought
up
from
the
library
on
the
night
of
thanksgiving
and
which
still
lay
open
on
the
table
they
have
the
same
thin
little
arms
and
ragged
clothes
and
everything
oh
i
am
sure
it
was
dot
that
i
ran
after
and
now
that
i
know
how
awful
it
is
to
be
lost
i
do
anything
to
find
her
i
dreamed
about
her
last
night
and
i
ca
think
about
anybody
else
so
positive
was
she
that
lloyd
could
hardly
wait
for
ten
to
come
the
hour
that
her
mother
had
promised
to
call
for
her
they
were
to
begin
their
christmas
shopping
that
morning
for
the
calendar
showed
them
that
whatever
gifts
they
intended
sending
betty
and
eugenia
must
soon
be
started
on
their
way
in
order
to
reach
them
in
time
lloyd
was
so
excited
over
the
prospect
of
finding
dot
that
she
wanted
to
postpone
the
shopping
and
start
at
once
for
the
tenement
district
where
elise
had
wandered
away
from
her
carriage
i
know
that
betty
and
eugenia
would
rather
do
without
any
christmas
gifts
she
declared
almost
tearfully
than
miss
this
chance
of
finding
her
betty
used
to
talk
about
it
all
the
time
and
if
we
do
go
this
morning
something
may
happen
that
we
may
never
find
her
but
be
reasonable
dear
answered
sherman
it
would
be
like
hunting
for
a
needle
in
a
you
have
such
a
slight
clue
lloyd
that
picture
is
a
picture
of
molly
sister
it
is
only
one
that
reminded
molly
of
her
and
there
are
thousands
of
poor
little
waifs
in
the
world
that
look
like
that
i
will
see
the
humane
society
about
her
and
the
teachers
of
the
free
kindergarten
who
work
in
that
district
and
we
will
report
the
case
to
the
police
it
would
be
useless
for
us
to
go
wandering
aimlessly
around
up
one
flight
of
dirty
stairs
and
down
another
lloyd
had
to
be
content
with
that
but
all
the
time
she
was
going
around
among
the
shops
trying
to
choose
gifts
appropriate
to
send
across
the
sea
she
kept
thinking
of
molly
as
she
had
seen
her
that
rainy
day
lying
face
downward
on
her
cot
and
sobbing
out
her
misery
in
the
little
attic
room
of
the
cuckoo
nest
they
went
back
to
walton
for
lunch
where
elise
was
still
talking
of
her
adventure
of
the
night
before
i
wish
dot
had
some
of
this
good
she
remarked
she
looked
so
cold
and
hungry
maybe
she
was
crying
because
she
did
have
anything
to
eat
walton
shook
her
head
in
perplexity
everything
leads
straight
back
to
that
subject
she
exclaimed
the
child
has
talked
of
nothing
else
all
morning
oh
i
almost
forgot
to
tell
you
lloyd
moore
called
while
you
were
out
this
morning
and
promised
elise
she
would
take
her
through
all
those
tenements
next
week
she
is
very
charitable
and
has
helped
so
many
poor
people
in
that
part
of
the
city
that
they
will
do
anything
for
her
she
thinks
that
there
really
may
be
some
possibility
of
finding
the
child
lloyd
face
shone
as
if
she
had
come
into
the
possession
of
a
fortune
she
was
sure
now
that
dot
would
be
found
in
time
to
keep
christmas
with
them
and
she
could
scarcely
wait
until
she
reached
home
to
write
to
betty
about
the
search
that
was
to
be
made
she
went
back
to
her
aunt
jane
that
afternoon
to
wait
until
train
time
much
to
the
disappointment
of
allison
and
kitty
who
were
arranging
some
tableaux
you
write
to
me
if
they
find
out
anything
about
dot
wo
you
she
asked
allison
at
parting
yes
the
very
next
breath
answered
allison
so
the
little
colonel
went
away
quite
hopeful
and
for
days
she
haunted
the
before
school
after
school
at
recess
sometimes
the
last
thing
before
dark
she
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
to
stand
on
tiptoe
and
see
if
anything
was
in
their
box
but
the
days
went
by
and
the
letter
never
came
there
were
papers
and
magazines
thick
letters
from
joyce
and
thin
ones
from
betty
and
eugenia
but
none
that
told
of
a
successful
search
for
dot
two
weeks
before
christmas
there
came
a
letter
from
allison
inviting
her
to
spend
the
following
saturday
in
town
on
the
opposite
page
her
mother
had
pencilled
a
postscript
almost
as
long
as
the
letter
itself
saying
do
come
in
with
lloyd
sister
elise
usually
makes
a
merry
christmas
for
the
little
ones
at
the
children
hospital
but
this
year
she
will
be
so
busy
with
other
things
that
she
has
asked
us
to
take
her
place
malcolm
and
keith
have
asked
for
an
unusually
big
celebration
at
fairchance
this
christmas
and
she
will
have
her
hands
full
trying
to
carry
out
all
their
plans
i
have
promised
to
take
her
place
here
and
we
have
planned
a
tiny
individual
christmas
tree
for
each
child
in
the
hospital
i
am
going
to
take
the
girls
down
there
saturday
and
let
them
talk
to
the
children
and
find
out
as
far
as
possible
what
gift
would
make
each
one
happy
be
sure
to
come
in
with
lloyd
even
if
we
have
failed
in
our
efforts
to
find
little
dot
we
may
have
a
hand
in
making
twenty
other
little
souls
supremely
happy
on
christmas
day
come
on
the
early
train
and
we
will
go
to
the
hospital
first
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
shopping
luckily
it
was
late
in
the
week
when
the
letter
arrived
or
lloyd
would
have
had
a
hard
time
waiting
for
saturday
so
impatient
was
she
for
the
holiday
to
come
that
she
began
to
count
the
hours
and
then
even
the
minutes
two
whole
days
and
nights
she
exclaimed
that
makes
hours
and
there
sixty
minutes
in
an
hour
and
sixty
seconds
in
a
minute
that
makes
let
me
see
it
was
too
big
a
sum
to
do
in
her
head
so
she
ran
for
pencil
and
paper
and
began
multiplying
carefully
putting
down
the
amount
in
neat
little
figures
one
hundred
and
thousand
eight
hundred
seconds
she
announced
finally
what
a
terrible
lot
the
clock
has
to
tick
that
many
times
before
i
can
go
but
remember
part
of
that
time
you
will
be
asleep
suggested
papa
jack
over
fifty
thousand
of
these
seconds
will
be
ticked
off
when
you
know
nothing
about
it
that
was
some
comfort
and
the
little
colonel
putting
on
her
warmest
winter
wrappings
went
out
to
make
some
of
the
other
seconds
go
by
unnoticed
by
rolling
up
snowballs
for
a
huge
on
the
lawn
it
had
been
a
dull
week
in
the
hospital
gray
skies
and
falling
snow
is
a
dreary
outlook
for
children
who
can
do
nothing
but
lie
in
their
narrow
beds
and
look
wearily
out
of
the
windows
this
saturday
morning
the
nurses
had
given
the
little
invalids
their
baths
and
breakfasts
the
doctors
had
made
their
rounds
and
in
each
ward
were
restless
little
bodies
who
longed
to
be
amused
those
who
were
well
enough
to
be
propped
up
in
bed
fingered
the
games
and
pictures
that
had
entertained
them
before
but
a
dozen
pairs
of
eyes
in
search
of
some
new
interest
turned
expectantly
toward
the
door
every
time
it
opened
suddenly
a
stir
went
through
the
ward
where
the
convalescents
lay
and
the
wintry
morning
seemed
to
blossom
into
four
little
girls
each
with
her
arms
full
of
great
red
roses
with
leafy
stems
so
long
that
it
seemed
the
whole
bush
must
have
been
cut
down
with
them
passed
down
the
room
leaving
one
at
each
pillow
my
aunt
elise
sent
them
said
the
smallest
child
pausing
at
the
first
white
bed
she
asked
us
to
bring
them
she
could
come
herself
they
american
beauties
and
they
always
make
me
think
of
my
aunt
elise
she
must
be
a
dandy
then
was
the
response
of
micky
on
whom
she
bestowed
one
taking
it
up
awkwardly
in
his
left
hand
his
right
one
was
still
in
a
sling
and
one
leg
had
just
been
taken
out
of
a
plaster
cast
for
he
had
been
run
over
by
a
heavy
truck
and
narrowly
escaped
being
made
a
cripple
for
life
elise
stopped
to
question
him
about
his
accident
and
found
that
despite
his
crippled
leg
a
pair
of
skates
was
what
he
wished
for
above
all
things
while
she
was
chattering
away
to
him
like
a
little
magpie
kitty
and
allison
went
on
down
the
room
with
their
roses
it
was
not
the
first
time
they
had
been
there
and
they
knew
some
of
the
children
by
name
but
it
was
all
new
to
lloyd
in
the
next
room
the
sight
of
the
white
little
faces
some
of
them
drawn
with
pain
almost
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
there
were
only
six
beds
in
this
ward
and
at
the
last
one
lloyd
laid
a
rose
down
very
softly
because
in
that
bed
the
little
invalid
lay
on
one
side
as
if
she
were
asleep
but
as
the
perfume
of
the
great
american
beauty
reached
her
she
opened
her
eyes
and
smiled
weakly
lloyd
was
so
startled
that
she
dropped
the
rest
of
the
roses
to
the
floor
and
clasped
both
hands
around
the
bedpost
for
the
eyes
that
smiled
up
at
her
keen
and
gray
with
their
curly
black
lashes
might
have
been
molly
own
they
were
so
like
hers
the
black
hair
brushed
back
from
the
white
face
waved
over
the
left
temple
exactly
as
molly
did
there
were
the
same
straight
black
eyebrows
and
the
familiar
droop
of
the
pretty
little
mouth
and
it
seemed
to
lloyd
as
she
stared
at
her
with
a
fascinated
gaze
that
it
was
molly
herself
who
lay
there
white
and
wan
only
a
much
smaller
molly
with
a
sad
hopeless
little
face
as
if
the
battle
with
life
had
proved
too
hard
and
she
was
slowly
giving
it
up
illustration
is
your
name
the
child
still
smiling
weakly
raised
her
bony
little
hand
to
lift
the
rose
from
the
pillow
and
even
the
gesture
with
which
she
laid
it
against
her
cheek
was
familiar
oh
is
your
name
cried
lloyd
forgetting
that
she
had
been
told
not
to
talk
in
that
room
the
people
i
lived
with
last
called
me
muggins
said
the
child
faintly
but
a
long
time
ago
it
used
to
be
dot
as
she
spoke
she
turned
her
head
so
that
both
sides
of
her
face
were
visible
and
lloyd
saw
that
across
the
right
eyebrow
was
a
thin
white
scar
oh
i
knew
it
cried
lloyd
under
her
breath
i
knew
it
the
minute
i
looked
at
you
then
to
the
child
astonishment
without
waiting
to
pick
up
the
fallen
roses
she
ran
breathlessly
into
the
hall
mothah
mrs
walton
she
cried
breaking
into
their
conversation
with
one
of
the
nurses
come
quick
i
found
her
it
really
truly
dot
she
says
that
is
her
name
and
she
looks
exactly
like
molly
oh
do
come
and
see
her
she
wanted
to
rush
back
to
the
child
with
the
news
that
she
knew
her
sister
molly
and
that
they
should
soon
be
together
but
the
nurse
said
it
would
excite
her
too
much
if
it
were
really
so
then
she
wanted
to
send
a
telegram
to
molly
and
a
cable
to
betty
saying
that
dot
had
been
found
but
nobody
except
herself
was
sure
that
this
little
dot
was
molly
sister
we
must
be
absolutely
sure
of
that
first
said
sherman
who
saw
the
same
strong
resemblance
to
molly
that
had
startled
the
little
colonel
but
who
knew
how
often
such
resemblances
exist
between
entire
strangers
think
how
cruel
it
would
be
to
raise
any
false
hopes
in
either
one
think
how
sure
elise
was
that
the
child
she
followed
was
molly
sister
you
both
could
be
right
for
this
one
was
brought
to
the
hospital
before
elise
was
lost
the
nurse
could
tell
very
little
the
child
had
been
picked
up
on
the
street
so
ill
that
she
was
delirious
and
all
their
investigating
had
proved
little
beyond
the
fact
that
she
had
been
deserted
by
her
drunken
father
her
illness
was
evidently
caused
by
lack
of
proper
food
and
clothing
nobody
knew
her
by
any
other
name
than
muggins
while
they
were
still
discussing
the
matter
in
the
hall
allison
had
a
bright
idea
why
could
you
telephone
for
ranald
to
bring
his
camera
and
take
a
picture
of
her
and
send
that
to
molly
if
she
says
it
is
dot
that
will
settle
it
the
nurse
thought
that
would
be
a
sensible
thing
to
do
but
they
had
to
wait
until
one
of
the
doctors
was
consulted
as
soon
as
he
gave
his
permission
they
began
to
make
arrangements
ranald
answered
his
mother
summons
promptly
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
setting
up
his
tripod
in
the
room
where
the
child
lay
a
pleased
smile
came
over
the
child
face
when
she
discovered
what
was
to
be
done
put
in
all
the
things
that
have
made
me
so
happy
while
i
have
been
in
the
hospital
she
said
to
the
nurse
so
that
when
i
leave
here
i
can
have
the
picture
of
them
to
look
at
so
they
laid
a
big
wax
doll
in
her
arms
that
had
been
her
constant
companion
and
around
her
on
the
counterpane
they
spread
the
games
and
pictures
she
had
played
with
before
she
grew
so
weak
on
her
pillow
was
the
and
close
beside
the
bed
they
wheeled
the
little
table
that
held
a
plate
of
white
grapes
and
oranges
just
as
ranald
was
ready
to
take
the
picture
the
matron
came
in
with
a
plate
of
oh
put
that
in
too
cried
muggins
miss
hale
sends
it
every
day
and
one
of
the
happiest
things
to
remember
about
the
hospital
it
is
like
heaven
is
it
she
exclaimed
glancing
around
at
the
luxuries
she
had
never
known
until
she
came
to
the
hospital
and
that
smile
was
on
her
face
when
ranald
took
the
picture
i
develop
it
as
soon
as
i
get
home
and
print
one
for
you
this
afternoon
he
promised
you
shall
have
one
will
you
print
me
one
too
inquired
the
little
colonel
anxiously
when
they
had
bidden
muggins
and
were
going
through
the
hall
i
want
one
to
send
to
betty
and
eugenia
and
one
to
send
to
joyce
and
one
to
keep
i
print
a
dozen
next
week
if
you
want
them
promised
ranald
but
the
first
one
must
be
for
that
little
dot
or
muggins
or
whatever
you
call
her
and
the
next
one
for
molly
it
was
sherman
who
wrote
the
letter
that
carried
the
picture
to
molly
by
the
same
mail
there
went
a
note
to
appleton
saying
that
in
case
molly
recognised
it
as
her
sister
they
would
send
for
her
to
come
and
spend
christmas
with
her
in
the
hospital
for
the
nurse
had
said
it
would
probably
be
the
child
last
christmas
and
they
wanted
to
do
all
they
could
to
make
it
a
happy
one
in
a
few
days
the
answer
came
molly
was
almost
wild
with
joy
and
would
start
as
soon
as
the
promised
railroad
ticket
reached
her
the
photograph
of
little
dot
was
scarcely
out
of
her
hands
appleton
said
she
propped
it
up
in
front
of
her
while
she
washed
the
dishes
it
lay
in
her
lap
when
she
was
at
the
table
and
at
night
she
slept
with
it
under
her
pillow
to
bring
her
happy
dreams
the
day
that
appleton
letter
came
allison
went
up
to
her
mother
room
and
stood
beside
her
desk
waiting
for
her
pen
to
come
to
the
end
of
a
page
mamma
she
said
as
walton
finally
looked
up
i
thought
of
such
a
nice
plan
have
you
time
to
listen
walton
smiled
up
at
the
thoughtful
face
of
her
eldest
daughter
you
should
have
been
named
pansy
my
dear
is
for
thought
you
know
and
i
glad
to
say
you
are
always
having
thoughts
of
some
sensible
way
to
help
other
people
i
very
busy
but
i
am
sure
your
plan
is
a
good
one
so
i
let
the
letters
wait
for
awhile
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
allison
dropping
down
on
the
rug
at
her
feet
began
eagerly
out
at
the
hospital
mamma
there
is
a
little
empty
room
at
the
end
of
a
side
hall
it
is
a
dear
little
room
with
a
fireplace
and
a
sunny
south
window
it
has
never
been
furnished
because
they
have
enough
money
i
asked
one
of
the
nurses
about
it
and
she
said
they
often
need
it
for
cases
like
dot
it
would
be
so
much
pleasanter
to
have
her
away
from
all
the
noise
and
i
been
thinking
if
it
could
be
fixed
up
for
dot
to
spend
christmas
in
how
much
nicer
it
would
be
for
her
and
molly
both
it
would
cost
very
much
to
furnish
it
just
enough
to
get
the
little
white
bedroom
set
and
the
sheets
and
towels
and
things
anyhow
it
would
be
much
more
than
you
often
spent
on
my
christmas
presents
and
i
wanted
to
know
if
you
would
let
me
do
that
this
year
instead
of
your
giving
me
a
christmas
present
please
mamma
i
set
my
heart
on
it
if
i
got
books
they
soon
be
read
and
jewelry
or
games
i
get
tired
of
after
awhile
and
things
to
wear
no
matter
how
pretty
would
be
worn
out
soon
but
this
is
something
that
would
last
for
years
i
could
think
every
day
that
some
poor
little
soul
who
has
never
known
anything
but
to
be
sick
or
sad
was
enjoying
my
pretty
room
that
is
as
beautiful
a
as
ever
blossomed
in
any
i
am
sure
said
walton
softly
smoothing
the
curly
head
resting
against
her
knee
and
mother
is
glad
that
her
little
girl
plans
are
such
sweet
unselfish
ones
we
go
this
very
afternoon
and
talk
to
the
matron
about
it
aladdin
lamp
is
not
the
only
thing
that
can
suddenly
bring
wonderful
things
to
pass
there
is
a
modern
magic
of
telephones
and
electric
cars
and
the
great
genii
of
sympathy
and
are
when
once
unbottled
so
a
few
hours
wrought
wonderful
changes
in
the
empty
little
room
and
next
morning
allison
stood
in
the
centre
of
it
looking
around
her
with
delighted
eyes
everything
was
as
white
and
fresh
as
a
snowdrop
from
the
little
bed
to
the
dainty
beside
the
window
a
soft
firelight
shone
on
the
hearth
of
the
open
fireplace
the
morning
sun
streamed
in
through
the
wide
south
window
where
a
pot
of
pink
hyacinths
swung
its
rosy
bells
and
allison
japanese
canary
nagasaki
twittered
in
its
gilded
cage
she
had
brought
it
all
the
way
from
japan
of
course
they
wo
want
it
in
the
room
all
the
time
she
said
but
there
will
be
days
when
the
children
will
love
to
have
it
brought
in
a
little
while
to
sing
to
them
if
you
give
up
nagasaki
then
i
give
my
globe
of
goldfish
said
kitty
anxious
to
do
her
part
toward
making
a
happy
time
for
little
dot
afterward
if
the
child
who
stays
in
that
room
is
too
sick
to
enjoy
it
it
can
go
into
the
convalescent
ward
it
was
into
this
room
that
molly
came
bringing
her
picture
of
the
good
shepherd
she
had
carried
it
in
her
arms
all
the
way
frequently
taking
it
out
of
its
brown
paper
wrapping
for
down
in
one
corner
of
the
frame
she
had
fastened
the
photograph
of
dot
all
that
morning
on
the
train
the
refrain
that
had
gone
through
her
happy
heart
as
she
looked
at
the
picture
was
oh
she
been
happy
for
a
month
she
got
grapes
and
oranges
and
a
doll
and
roses
in
the
picture
and
and
there
lace
on
her
nightgown
and
she
is
shall
we
name
the
room
for
you
miss
allison
asked
the
nurse
when
the
picture
of
the
good
shepherd
was
hung
over
the
mantel
and
dot
lay
looking
up
at
it
with
tired
eyes
her
little
hand
clasped
in
molly
and
a
satisfied
smile
on
her
face
no
whispered
allison
her
glance
following
the
gaze
of
the
eyes
call
it
fold
of
the
good
she
looks
like
a
poor
little
lost
lamb
that
had
just
found
its
way
home
i
wish
all
the
poor
little
stray
lambs
might
find
as
warm
a
shelter
answered
the
nurse
in
an
undertone
and
i
hope
my
dear
that
all
your
christmases
will
be
as
happy
as
the
one
you
are
making
for
her
chapter
xv
a
happy
christmas
there
was
a
fortnight
vacation
at
christmas
time
lloyd
spent
nearly
all
the
week
before
in
town
and
not
once
in
all
that
time
did
it
occur
to
her
to
wonder
what
she
might
find
in
her
own
stocking
she
was
too
busy
helping
get
the
little
trees
ready
for
the
children
in
the
hospital
there
were
twenty
of
them
each
one
complete
with
starry
tapers
and
glittering
ornaments
with
candy
apples
and
sugar
animals
hung
by
the
neck
with
tiny
tarlatan
stockings
of
bonbons
with
festoons
of
snowy
popcorn
and
all
that
goes
to
make
up
the
christmas
trees
that
are
the
dearest
memories
of
childhood
and
somewhere
hidden
among
the
branches
of
each
one
or
lying
at
its
base
was
the
especial
book
or
toy
or
game
that
its
owner
had
been
known
to
long
for
i
believe
that
molly
and
dot
would
rather
have
theirs
together
said
allison
as
they
are
in
a
room
by
themselves
we
can
give
them
as
large
a
one
as
we
please
and
the
others
will
never
know
it
so
it
was
a
tree
that
was
set
aside
for
the
fold
the
very
prettiest
of
the
ornaments
were
put
with
it
the
brightest
coloured
candles
and
at
the
top
was
fastened
a
glittering
christmas
angel
and
a
shining
christmas
star
it
was
not
till
the
day
before
christmas
that
they
began
to
think
of
their
own
affairs
then
kitty
brought
out
four
stockings
which
the
little
colonel
examined
with
interest
they
were
long
and
wide
with
tiny
on
the
top
the
heels
and
the
toes
that
jingled
musically
at
the
slightest
movement
two
were
pink
and
two
were
blue
what
charmed
lloyd
the
most
were
the
fascinating
pictures
printed
on
them
they
told
the
whole
story
of
christmas
holly
and
mistletoe
and
christmas
trees
were
on
one
side
down
which
ran
a
road
where
pranced
the
reindeer
with
the
magic
sleigh
driven
by
jolly
old
santa
claus
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
stocking
was
the
picture
of
the
fireplace
and
a
row
of
stockings
hanging
from
the
mantel
in
a
cradle
near
by
lay
a
baby
asleep
down
on
the
toe
was
printed
in
fancy
letters
hang
up
the
baby
stocking
be
sure
and
do
forget
the
dear
little
dimpled
darling
has
never
seen
christmas
yet
we
hang
them
up
every
year
explained
kitty
ranald
and
all
of
us
it
would
seem
like
christmas
if
we
used
any
other
kind
we
had
them
in
washington
and
at
every
army
post
we
lived
at
and
they
been
around
the
world
with
us
if
they
could
talk
they
could
tell
of
more
good
times
than
any
other
stockings
in
the
world
um
i
just
mine
cried
elise
catching
hers
up
with
a
caressing
squeeze
and
then
swinging
it
around
her
head
until
every
little
bell
was
set
musically
a
little
while
later
she
said
with
a
serious
face
i
do
molly
and
dot
ever
saw
a
beautiful
picture
stocking
like
this
do
you
gifts
seem
so
much
nicer
when
they
come
out
of
it
than
out
of
the
common
kind
that
i
believe
i
lend
them
mine
this
year
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
lost
you
know
i
so
glad
that
i
was
found
that
i
like
to
do
something
to
show
how
thankful
i
am
about
it
but
how
will
santa
claus
know
it
to
be
filled
for
them
asked
kitty
he
has
always
filled
it
for
you
and
he
might
put
your
things
in
it
and
they
get
them
i
could
pin
a
note
on
it
saying
it
was
mine
but
to
please
put
their
things
in
it
this
one
time
said
elise
with
a
troubled
look
as
she
went
over
to
the
window
to
consider
the
matter
by
herself
a
little
while
later
she
carried
her
stocking
to
her
mother
with
this
note
pinned
to
it
dear
santa
claus
this
is
my
stocking
i
you
recognise
it
as
i
carried
it
around
the
world
with
me
and
you
have
put
lots
of
pretty
things
in
it
for
me
every
year
since
i
was
born
but
this
year
please
put
molly
and
dot
presents
in
it
and
i
shall
be
a
million
times
obliged
to
you
your
loving
little
friend
elise
walton
but
what
will
you
do
little
one
asked
walton
hang
up
one
of
my
blue
silk
stockings
said
elise
promptly
as
she
danced
around
the
room
jingling
the
bells
on
heel
and
toe
in
time
to
a
gay
little
tune
of
her
own
lloyd
would
not
have
missed
taking
part
in
the
christmas
celebration
at
the
hospital
for
anything
yet
she
could
not
give
up
her
usual
custom
of
hanging
her
stocking
beside
the
old
fireplace
at
locust
so
in
order
to
give
her
both
pleasures
it
was
finally
decided
that
the
trees
should
be
taken
to
the
hospital
at
dusk
on
christmas
eve
and
she
could
go
home
afterward
on
the
nine
train
malcolm
and
keith
were
having
a
great
celebration
out
at
fairchance
for
jonesy
and
all
who
had
been
gathered
into
the
home
since
its
founding
miss
allison
was
helping
them
and
could
not
go
into
town
much
to
the
disappointment
of
the
girls
i
wish
that
auntie
was
twins
said
kitty
mournfully
then
she
could
be
in
both
places
at
once
the
boys
are
always
wanting
her
whenever
we
do
your
auntie
helped
with
the
celebration
last
year
at
the
hospital
said
her
mother
so
it
is
only
fair
that
they
should
have
her
in
the
country
this
year
but
malcolm
and
keith
were
with
her
both
times
persisted
kitty
jealously
i
think
that
it
is
just
too
bad
that
she
is
twins
rob
and
ranald
went
with
the
girls
to
help
distribute
the
trees
it
seemed
as
if
a
tiny
forest
had
been
carried
out
of
fairyland
and
set
in
long
glittering
rows
down
the
sides
of
the
wards
one
twinkled
and
bloomed
beside
each
little
white
bed
the
children
did
not
stay
long
in
the
wards
they
were
more
interested
in
the
little
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
allison
room
that
was
known
all
over
the
building
now
as
the
fold
of
the
good
shepherd
the
room
where
two
little
sisters
lost
from
each
other
so
long
but
brought
together
at
last
lived
through
the
happy
hours
hand
in
hand
molly
face
had
lost
every
trace
of
its
old
sullen
pout
and
fairly
shone
with
contentment
as
she
sat
by
dot
bed
smoothing
her
pillow
feeding
her
from
time
to
time
as
the
nurse
directed
and
singing
softly
when
the
tired
eyes
drooped
wearily
to
sleep
she
would
make
a
fine
nurse
said
the
matron
to
walton
she
is
strong
and
patient
and
seems
to
have
so
much
sense
about
what
to
do
for
a
sick
person
usually
we
would
think
of
letting
anybody
come
in
as
she
is
doing
but
she
minds
the
nurse
slightest
nod
and
seems
to
be
doing
dot
more
good
than
medicine
it
had
cost
elise
a
pang
to
give
up
her
cherished
stocking
even
as
a
loan
but
she
was
more
than
repaid
by
the
pleasure
it
gave
the
child
who
had
known
no
christmas
story
and
none
of
its
joy
since
she
had
been
large
enough
to
remember
they
went
back
to
their
homes
as
soon
afterward
as
possible
lloyd
to
hang
up
her
stocking
at
locust
and
the
children
to
put
theirs
by
the
library
fire
one
plain
little
blue
one
hung
among
the
gay
pictured
ones
no
mistletoe
upon
it
no
holly
no
jingling
bells
no
printed
rhymes
but
as
walton
gathered
elise
little
white
gowned
form
in
her
arms
she
repeated
something
that
made
the
child
look
up
wonderingly
oh
mamma
she
cried
does
it
mean
that
the
little
counts
it
just
the
same
my
lending
the
stocking
to
dot
and
molly
as
if
i
had
loaned
it
to
him
just
the
same
little
one
and
he
is
glad
she
asked
the
question
in
an
awed
whisper
i
am
sure
he
is
far
gladder
than
they
somehow
the
thought
that
she
had
really
brought
joy
to
the
made
more
music
in
her
heart
that
christmas
eve
than
all
the
tinkling
of
the
tiny
christmas
bells
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
of
all
the
good
times
that
filled
the
happy
holiday
at
fairchance
it
was
a
sight
worth
travelling
miles
to
see
those
merry
little
lads
and
the
two
little
knights
who
had
gone
so
far
in
their
trying
to
right
the
wrong
and
follow
the
king
at
locust
lloyd
spent
a
happy
day
in
a
bewilderment
of
gifts
for
besides
all
that
she
found
in
her
overflowing
stocking
were
the
packages
from
joyce
and
eugenia
and
betty
there
was
a
new
saddle
for
tarbaby
from
her
grandfather
and
a
silver
collar
from
rob
for
his
frisky
namesake
with
bob
engraved
on
the
clasp
all
day
there
were
woolly
little
heads
popping
into
the
hall
to
say
gif
miss
lloyd
and
then
white
would
shine
and
snowy
teeth
gleam
as
she
handed
out
the
candy
and
nuts
and
oranges
reserved
for
such
calls
every
old
black
mammy
or
uncle
who
had
ever
worked
on
the
place
every
little
pickaninny
who
could
find
the
slightest
claim
visited
the
great
house
at
some
time
during
the
day
for
a
share
of
its
holiday
cheer
in
the
walton
household
there
was
a
chattering
in
the
library
long
before
sunrise
for
kitty
impatient
to
see
what
was
in
her
stocking
had
stolen
down
when
the
clock
struck
five
and
the
other
girls
had
followed
in
her
wake
i
got
fourteen
presents
said
kitty
chattering
back
to
bed
in
the
gray
dawn
after
a
blissful
examination
of
her
stocking
so
did
i
said
elise
everything
in
the
world
that
i
wanted
and
lots
of
things
i
never
dreamed
of
getting
besides
auntie
and
aunt
elise
always
think
of
such
lovely
things
allison
gifts
did
not
make
such
a
brave
showing
when
spread
out
with
the
others
but
she
thought
of
the
little
white
room
at
the
hospital
with
a
warm
glow
in
her
heart
that
was
worth
more
than
all
the
gifts
that
money
could
buy
down
in
the
toe
of
her
stocking
she
found
a
box
from
her
aunt
allison
and
took
it
back
to
bed
with
her
to
open
inside
the
jeweller
cotton
was
a
little
enamelled
pansy
of
royal
purple
and
gold
and
in
the
centre
sparkled
a
tiny
diamond
like
a
drop
of
dew
mamma
must
have
told
her
thought
allison
as
she
read
the
greeting
written
on
the
card
with
it
for
my
dear
little
namesake
may
your
whole
lifetime
blossom
with
such
beautiful
thoughts
for
others
as
has
made
this
christmas
day
a
joy
out
at
the
hospital
as
the
day
went
by
dot
sat
with
her
hand
in
molly
looking
from
time
to
time
with
eyes
that
never
lost
their
expression
of
content
at
the
angel
and
the
star
that
crowned
the
tree
she
grew
weaker
and
weaker
as
the
hours
passed
but
opening
her
eyes
now
and
then
she
smiled
at
molly
and
squeezed
her
hand
and
looked
again
from
the
gay
stocking
hanging
on
the
foot
of
her
bed
to
the
shining
angel
atop
of
the
tree
the
japanese
canary
twittered
in
his
cage
the
goldfish
flashed
around
and
around
in
their
sunny
globe
the
deep
red
roses
on
the
table
bloomed
as
if
it
were
outside
there
was
snow
and
ice
and
winter
winds
inside
it
was
all
cheer
and
comfort
and
peace
that
happy
christmas
day
walton
and
the
girls
came
down
again
in
the
twilight
dot
was
too
weak
to
say
much
but
she
asked
walton
to
sing
and
wanted
the
tapers
lighted
again
on
the
tree
thoughtful
allison
had
brought
fresh
ones
with
her
which
she
soon
fastened
in
place
and
so
presently
with
only
the
soft
firelight
in
the
room
and
the
starlight
of
the
little
christmas
candles
walton
began
an
old
tune
that
she
loved
her
beautiful
voice
had
sung
it
in
many
a
hospital
in
the
cheerless
tents
of
many
a
camp
many
a
brave
soldier
dying
thousands
of
miles
away
from
home

my

countrie
she
sang
not
the
sweet
old
scotch
words
with
the
breath
of
the
moors
and
the
scent
of
the
heather
in
them
that
she
loved
she
changed
them
so
that
the
child
could
understand
dot
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
up
at
the
picture
of
the
good
shepherd
hanging
over
the
mantel
as
she
sang
he
gathers
in
his
bosom
all
the
helpless
lambs
like
me
and
he
takes
them
where
he
going
to
my
own
country
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
dot
asked
suddenly
will
everything
there
be
as
lovely
as
it
is
here
in
the
hospital
when
walton
nodded
yes
she
added
with
a
long
fluttering
sigh
oh
i
been
so
happy
here
i
do
see
how
heaven
could
be
any
nicer

illustration
the
little
hand
held
hers
she
fell
asleep
a
little
later
to
the
soothing
refrain
of
an
old
lullaby
and
never
knew
when
her
guests
slipped
out
with
a
whispered
good
night
to
molly
an
hour
went
by
the
christmas
tapers
burned
lower
and
lower
and
finally
went
out
one
by
one
till
there
was
left
only
the
one
above
the
angel
and
the
star
the
fire
flickered
on
the
hearth
but
molly
did
not
rise
to
replenish
it
for
the
little
hand
held
hers
and
she
did
not
want
to
waken
such
sweet
sleep
the
nurse
looked
in
at
the
door
once
or
twice
and
slipped
out
again
nagasaki
curled
up
like
a
feather
ball
with
his
head
under
his
wing
stirred
once
with
a
sleepy
twitter
but
no
other
sound
broke
the
stillness
of
the
little
room
again
the
door
opened
softly
and
the
doctor
stepped
in
on
his
round
of
evening
visits
he
laid
his
finger
on
the
little
one
pulse
a
moment
and
then
turned
away
the
last
taper
on
the
tree
that
lit
the
star
glowing
above
the
christmas
angel
gave
a
final
flicker
and
went
out
the
doctor
stepping
into
the
hall
met
one
of
the
nurses
have
to
tell
her
sister
he
said
she
is
still
holding
the
little
one
hand
thinking
that
she
is
asleep
but
her
life
went
out
with
the
last
of
the
christmas
candles
it
was
not
until
next
day
that
the
children
heard
what
had
happened
the
evening
before
the
matron
had
telephoned
immediately
to
walton
but
she
did
not
tell
the
children
or
send
word
to
locust
until
next
morning
she
did
not
want
a
single
shadow
to
rest
on
their
glad
christmas
day
i
do
not
believe
in
taking
children
to
funerals
she
said
to
her
sister
elise
but
death
seems
so
beautiful
in
this
instance
that
i
want
them
to
see
it
the
at
the
hospital
had
been
fitted
up
like
a
chapel
an
altar
draped
in
white
was
covered
with
flowers
and
before
it
stood
the
white
casket
where
dot
frail
little
body
was
tenderly
tucked
away
for
its
last
sleep
all
of
the
children
were
there
the
two
little
knights
with
a
sweet
seriousness
in
their
handsome
faces
wearing
in
their
buttonholes
aunt
allison
badge
the
pin
that
was
to
remind
them
that
they
were
trying
to
wear
also
the
white
flower
of
a
blameless
life
the
little
captain
stood
beside
them
thinking
as
he
looked
at
the
little
body
the
saloons
had
killed
for
nothing
but
the
cruelty
and
neglect
of
a
drunken
father
had
caused
dot
illness
and
death
that
there
were
battles
to
fight
for
his
country
at
home
as
well
as
those
on
foreign
fields
the
manly
little
shoulders
squared
themselves
with
a
grave
resolution
to
wear
whatever
duty
the
future
might
lay
upon
them
in
warfare
against
evil
as
worthily
as
he
had
worn
the
epaulets
in
luzon
allison
and
kitty
and
elise
were
there
and
the
little
colonel
all
strongly
moved
by
the
unusual
scene
it
was
a
very
short
and
simple
service
the
late
afternoon
sun
shone
in
aslant
through
the
western
window
like
a
wide
bar
of
gold
the
minister
read
the
parable
of
the
ninety
and
nine
and
repeated
the
burial
service
then
there
was
a
prayer
and
miss
allison
seating
herself
at
the
organ
touched
the
keys
in
soft
chords
for
walton
to
sing
she
sung
the
lullaby
that
dot
had
asked
for
the
night
before
the
of
hundreds
of
happy
children
tender
shepherd
hear
me
bless
thy
little
lamb
through
the
darkness
be
thou
near
me
keep
me
safe
till
morning
light
my
sins
be
all
forgiven
bless
the
friends
i
love
so
well
take
me
when
i
die
to
heaven
happy
there
with
thee
to
dwell
when
it
was
all
over
they
filed
softly
out
into
the
corridor
feeling
that
they
had
only
said
good
night
to
little
dot
and
that
it
was
good
that
one
so
tired
and
worn
should
find
such
deep
and
restful
sleep
it
was
not
at
all
like
what
they
had
imagined
dying
to
be
even
molly
did
cry
said
kitty
wonderingly
as
they
went
home
together
in
the
twilight
no
said
walton
she
said
to
me
that
she
had
done
all
her
crying
in
those
dreadful
years
when
they
were
separated
she
said
walton
now
that
i
know
that
she
comfortable
and
happy
i
ca
feel
so
bad
about
her
as
i
used
to
she
so
safe
now
no
matter
what
happens
the
saloons
ca
hurt
her
now
there
be
no
more
hungry
days
no
more
beatings
and
it
will
always
be
such
a
comfort
to
me
to
think
she
had
such
a
good
time
in
the
hospital
for
six
weeks
she
had
plenty
to
eat
and
everybody
was
good
to
her
every
time
i
look
at
her
picture
i
think
of
that
she
had
white
grapes
and
roses
even
in
the
and
she
had
all
she
wanted
and
i
made
up
my
mind
this
morning
that
when
i
old
enough
i
am
going
to
be
a
trained
nurse
and
help
take
care
of
poor
little
children
the
way
she
was
taken
care
of
here
miss
agnes
says
she
can
find
room
for
me
right
away
for
there
all
sorts
of
things
that
i
can
do
and
i
love
to
do
it
for
my
poor
little
dot
sake
i
must
write
that
to
betty
thought
the
little
colonel
that
is
the
most
beautiful
way
of
all
to
build
a
road
of
the
loving
heart
she
thought
of
it
all
the
way
home
as
the
train
sped
on
through
the
wintry
fields
between
fences
it
was
dark
when
the
brakeman
called
lloydsboro
valley
but
walker
was
waiting
with
the
carriage
and
they
were
soon
driving
in
at
the
great
entrance
gate
oh
mothah
said
the
little
colonel
nestling
closer
under
the
warm
carriage
robes
see
how
the
stars
shine
through
the
and
how
the
light
streams
out
from
the
house
down
the
avenue
to
meet
us
somehow
no
mattah
how
happy
the
holidays
are
it
always
seems
so
good
to
get
home
chapter

a
peep
into
the
future
and
what
happened
next
ah
that
i
can
not
tell
you
for
the
rest
of
the
story
is
yet
to
be
lived
only
the

magic
caldron
can
give
you
a

into
the
future
gather
around
it
all
you
curious

princes
and
princesses

thrust
your
fingers
into
the
steam
as
the
water
bubbles
and
the
bells
begin
again
i
can
not
tell
what
it
will
show
you
glimpses
of
college
life
perhaps
and
gay
vacation
times
as
rob
and
the
captain
and
the
two
little
knights
leave
their
boyhood
days
behind
them
and
grow
up
into
manly
young
fellows
ready
to
take
the
places
waiting
for
them
in
the
world
perhaps
there
will
be
college
days
and
gay
vacation
times
for
the
girls
too
with
white
commencement
gowns
and
diplomas
and
june
roses
and
away
off
in
the
distance
there
may
be
the
sound
of
wedding
bells
ringing
for
them
all

if
it
is
