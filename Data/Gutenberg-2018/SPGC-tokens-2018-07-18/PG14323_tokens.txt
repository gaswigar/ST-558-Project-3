chapter
i
you
believe
pretty
thoroughly
in
these
things
or
you
would
abandon
the
eternal
triangle
and
the
other
stock
subjects
of
the
modern
novelists
to
write
the
story
of
gilles
de
rais
and
after
a
silence
des
hermies
added
i
do
not
object
to
the
latrine
hospital
and
workshop
vocabulary
of
naturalism
for
one
thing
the
subject
matter
requires
some
such
diction
again
zola
in
has
shown
that
a
artist
can
slap
words
together
and
give
an
effect
of
tremendous
power
i
do
not
really
care
how
the
naturalists
maltreat
language
but
i
do
strenuously
object
to
the
earthiness
of
their
ideas
they
have
made
our
literature
the
incarnation
of
materialism
and
they
glorify
the
democracy
of
art
say
what
you
will
their
theory
is
pitiful
and
their
tight
little
method
squeezes
all
the
life
out
of
them
filth
and
the
flesh
are
their
all
in
all
they
deny
wonder
and
reject
the
i
believe
they
would
know
what
you
meant
if
you
told
them
that
artistic
curiosity
begins
at
the
very
point
where
the
senses
leave
off
you
shrug
your
shoulders
but
tell
me
how
much
has
naturalism
done
to
clear
up
life
really
troublesome
mysteries
when
an
ulcer
of
the
soul
or
indeed
the
most
benign
little
pimple
is
to
be
probed
naturalism
can
do
nothing
and
instinct
seem
to
be
its
sole
motivation
and
rut
and
brainstorm
its
chronic
states
the
field
of
naturalism
is
the
region
below
the
umbilicus
oh
it
a
hernia
clinic
and
it
offers
the
soul
a
truss
i
tell
you
durtal
it
superficial
quackery
and
that
is
all
this
fetid
naturalism
eulogizes
the
atrocities
of
modern
life
and
flatters
our
positively
american
ways
it
ecstasizes
over
brute
force
and
apotheosizes
the
cash
register
with
amazing
humility
it
defers
to
the
nauseating
taste
of
the
mob
it
repudiates
style
it
rejects
every
ideal
every
aspiration
towards
the
supernatural
and
the
beyond
it
is
so
perfectly
representative
of
bourgeois
thought
that
it
might
be
sired
by
homais
and
dammed
by
lisa
the
butcher
girl
in
de
heavens
how
you
go
after
it
said
durtal
somewhat
piqued
he
lighted
his
cigarette
and
went
on
i
am
as
much
revolted
by
materialism
as
you
are
but
that
is
no
reason
for
denying
the
unforgettable
services
which
naturalism
has
rendered
it
has
demolished
the
inhuman
puppets
of
romanticism
and
rescued
our
literature
from
the
clutches
of
booby
idealists
and
old
maids
it
has
created
visible
and
tangible
human
beings
after
balzac
and
put
them
in
accord
with
their
surroundings
it
has
carried
on
the
work
which
romanticism
began
of
developing
the
language
some
of
the
naturalists
have
had
the
veritable
gift
of
laughter
a
very
few
have
had
the
gift
of
tears
and
in
spite
of
what
you
say
they
have
not
all
been
carried
away
by
an
obsession
for
baseness
yes
they
have
they
are
in
love
with
the
age
and
that
shows
them
up
for
what
they
are
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
flaubert
and
the
de
goncourts
were
in
love
with
the
age
of
course
not
but
those
men
were
artists
honest
seditious
and
aloof
and
i
put
them
in
a
class
by
themselves
i
will
also
grant
that
zola
is
a
master
of
backgrounds
and
masses
and
that
his
tricky
handling
of
people
is
unequalled
then
too
thank
god
he
has
never
followed
out
in
his
novels
the
theories
enunciated
in
his
magazine
articles
adulating
the
intrusion
of
positivism
upon
art
but
in
the
works
of
his
best
pupil
rosny
the
only
talented
novelist
who
is
really
imbued
with
the
ideas
of
the
master
naturalism
has
become
a
sickening
jargon
of
chemist
slang
serving
to
display
a
layman
erudition
which
is
about
as
profound
as
the
scientific
knowledge
of
a
shop
foreman
no
there
is
no
getting
around
it
everything
this
whole
school
has
produced
shows
that
our
literature
has
fallen
upon
evil
days
the
grovellers
they
do
rise
above
the
moral
level
of
the
tumblebug
read
the
latest
book
what
do
you
find
simple
anecdotes
murder
suicide
and
accident
histories
copied
right
out
of
the
newspaper
tiresome
sketches
and
wormy
tales
all
written
in
a
colorless
style
and
containing
not
the
faintest
hint
of
an
outlook
on
life
nor
an
appreciation
of
human
nature
when
i
have
waded
through
one
of
these
books
its
insipid
descriptions
and
interminable
harangues
go
instantly
out
of
my
mind
and
the
only
impression
that
remains
is
one
of
surprise
that
a
man
can
write
three
or
four
hundred
pages
when
he
has
absolutely
nothing
to
reveal
to
us
nothing
to
say
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
des
hermies
let
speak
of
something
else
we
shall
never
agree
on
the
subject
of
naturalism
as
the
very
mention
of
it
makes
you
see
red
what
about
this
mattei
system
of
medicine
your
globules
and
electric
phials
at
least
relieve
a
few
sufferers
hmph
a
little
better
than
the
panaceas
of
the
codex
though
i
say
the
effects
are
either
lasting
or
sure
but
it
serves
like
anything
else
and
now
i
must
run
along
the
clock
is
striking
ten
and
your
concierge
is
coming
to
put
out
the
hall
light
see
you
again
very
soon
i
hope
good
night
when
the
door
closed
durtal
put
some
more
coke
in
the
grate
and
resumed
a
comfortless
train
of
thought
aggravated
by
this
too
pertinent
discussion
with
his
friend
for
some
months
durtal
had
been
trying
to
reassemble
the
fragments
of
a
shattered
literary
theory
which
had
once
seemed
inexpugnable
and
des
hermies
opinions
troubled
him
in
spite
of
their
exaggerated
vehemence
certainly
if
naturalism
confined
one
to
monotonous
studies
of
mediocre
persons
and
to
interminable
inventories
of
the
objects
in
a
or
a
landscape
an
honest
and
artist
would
soon
cease
to
produce
and
a
less
conscientious
workman
would
be
under
the
necessity
of
repeating
himself
over
and
over
again
to
the
point
of
nausea
nevertheless
durtal
could
see
no
possibilities
for
the
novelist
outside
of
naturalism
were
we
to
go
back
to
the
pyrotechnics
of
romanticism
rewrite
the
lanuginous
works
of
the
cherbuliez
and
feuillet
tribe
or
worse
yet
imitate
the
lachrymose
storiettes
of
theuriet
and
george
sand
then
what
was
to
be
done
and
durtal
with
desperate
determination
set
to
work
sorting
out
a
tangle
of
confused
theories
and
inchoate
postulations
he
made
no
headway
he
felt
but
could
not
define
he
was
afraid
to
definition
of
his
present
tendencies
would
plump
him
back
into
his
old
dilemma
we
must
he
thought
retain
the
documentary
veracity
the
precision
of
detail
the
compact
and
sinewy
language
of
realism
but
we
must
also
dig
down
into
the
soul
and
cease
trying
to
explain
mystery
in
terms
of
our
sick
senses
if
possible
the
novel
ought
to
be
compounded
of
two
elements
that
of
the
soul
and
that
of
the
body
and
these
ought
to
be
inextricably
bound
together
as
in
life
their
interreactions
their
conflicts
their
reconciliation
ought
to
furnish
the
dramatic
interest
in
a
word
we
must
follow
the
road
laid
out
once
and
for
all
by
zola
but
at
the
same
time
we
must
trace
a
parallel
route
in
the
air
by
which
we
may
go
above
and
beyond
a
spiritual
naturalism
it
must
be
complete
powerful
daring
in
a
different
way
from
anything
that
is
being
attempted
at
present
perhaps
as
approaching
my
concept
i
may
cite
dostoyevsky
yet
that
russian
is
less
an
elevated
realist
than
an
evangelic
socialist
in
france
right
now
the
purely
corporal
recipe
has
brought
upon
itself
such
discredit
that
two
clans
have
arisen
the
liberal
which
prunes
naturalism
of
all
its
boldness
of
subject
matter
and
diction
in
order
to
fit
it
for
the
and
the
decadent
which
gets
completely
off
the
ground
and
raves
incoherently
in
a
telegraphic
patois
intended
to
represent
the
language
of
the
soul
intended
rather
to
divert
the
reader
attention
from
the
author
utter
lack
of
ideas
as
for
the
right
wing
verists
i
can
only
laugh
at
the
frantic
puerilities
of
these
psychologists
who
have
never
explored
an
unknown
district
of
the
mind
nor
ever
studied
an
unhackneyed
passion
they
simply
repeat
the
saccharine
feuillet
and
the
saline
stendhal
their
novels
are
dissertations
in
style
they
do
seem
to
realize
that
there
is
more
spiritual
revelation
in
that
one
reply
of
old
hulot
in
balzac
i
take
the
little
girl
along
than
in
all
their
doctoral
theses
we
must
expect
of
them
no
idealistic
straining
toward
the
infinite
for
me
then
the
real
psychologist
of
this
century
is
not
their
stendhal
but
that
astonishing
ernest
hello
whose
unrelenting
unsuccess
is
simply
miraculous
he
began
to
think
that
des
hermies
was
right
in
the
present
disorganized
state
of
letters
there
was
but
one
tendency
which
seemed
to
promise
better
things
the
unsatisfied
need
for
the
supernatural
was
driving
people
in
default
of
something
loftier
to
spiritism
and
the
occult
now
his
thoughts
carried
him
away
from
his
dissatisfaction
with
literature
to
the
satisfaction
he
had
found
in
another
art
in
painting
his
ideal
was
completely
realized
by
the
primitives
these
men
in
italy
germany
and
especially
in
flanders
had
manifested
the
amplitude
and
purity
of
vision
which
are
the
property
of
saintliness
in
authentic
and
patiently
accurate
settings
they
pictured
beings
whose
postures
were
caught
from
life
itself
and
the
illusion
was
compelling
and
sure
from
these
heads
common
enough
many
of
them
and
these
physiognomies
often
ugly
but
powerfully
evocative
emanated
celestial
joy
or
acute
anguish
spiritual
calm
or
turmoil
the
effect
was
of
matter
transformed
by
being
distended
or
compressed
to
afford
an
escape
from
the
senses
into
remote
infinity
durtal
introduction
to
this
naturalism
had
come
as
a
revelation
the
year
before
although
he
had
not
then
been
so
weary
as
now
of
de
silliness
in
germany
before
a
crucifixion
by
matthæus
grünewald
he
had
found
what
he
was
seeking
he
shuddered
in
his
armchair
and
closed
his
eyes
as
if
in
pain
with
extraordinary
lucidity
he
revisualized
the
picture
and
the
cry
of
admiration
wrung
from
him
when
he
had
entered
the
little
room
of
the
cassel
museum
was
reechoing
in
his
mind
as
here
in
his
study
the
christ
rose
before
him
formidable
on
a
rude
cross
of
barky
wood
the
arm
an
untrimmed
branch
bending
like
a
bow
under
the
weight
of
the
body
this
branch
seemed
about
to
spring
back
and
mercifully
hurl
afar
from
our
cruel
sinful
world
the
suffering
flesh
held
to
earth
by
the
enormous
spike
piercing
the
feet
dislocated
almost
ripped
out
of
their
sockets
the
arms
of
the
christ
seemed
trammelled
by
the
knotty
cords
of
the
straining
muscles
the
laboured
tendons
of
the
armpits
seemed
ready
to
snap
the
fingers
wide
apart
were
contorted
in
an
arrested
gesture
in
which
were
supplication
and
reproach
but
also
benediction
the
trembling
thighs
were
greasy
with
sweat
the
ribs
were
like
staves
or
like
the
bars
of
a
cage
the
flesh
swollen
blue
mottled
with
specked
as
with
by
spines
broken
off
from
the
rods
of
the
scourging
and
now
festering
beneath
the
skin
where
they
had
penetrated
purulence
was
at
hand
the
fluvial
wound
in
the
side
dripped
thickly
inundating
the
thigh
with
blood
that
was
like
congealing
mulberry
juice
milky
pus
which
yet
was
somewhat
reddish
something
like
the
colour
of
grey
moselle
oozed
from
the
chest
and
ran
down
over
the
abdomen
and
the
loin
cloth
the
knees
had
been
forced
together
and
the
rotulæ
touched
but
the
lower
legs
were
held
wide
apart
though
the
feet
were
placed
one
on
top
of
the
other
these
beginning
to
putrefy
were
turning
green
beneath
a
river
of
blood
spongy
and
blistered
they
were
horrible
the
flesh
tumefied
swollen
over
the
head
of
the
spike
and
the
gripping
toes
with
the
horny
blue
nails
contradicted
the
imploring
gesture
of
the
hands
turning
that
benediction
into
a
curse
and
as
the
hands
pointed
heavenward
so
the
feet
seemed
to
cling
to
earth
to
that
ochre
ground
ferruginous
like
the
purple
soil
of
thuringia
above
this
eruptive
cadaver
the
head
tumultuous
enormous
encircled
by
a
disordered
crown
of
thorns
hung
down
lifeless
one
lacklustre
eye
half
opened
as
a
shudder
of
terror
or
of
sorrow
traversed
the
expiring
figure
the
face
was
furrowed
the
brow
seamed
the
cheeks
blanched
all
the
drooping
features
wept
while
the
mouth
unnerved
its
under
jaw
racked
by
tetanic
contractions
laughed
atrociously
the
torture
had
been
terrific
and
the
agony
had
frightened
the
mocking
executioners
into
flight
against
a
dark
blue
the
cross
seemed
to
bow
down
almost
to
touch
the
ground
with
its
tip
while
two
figures
one
on
each
side
kept
watch
over
the
christ
one
was
the
virgin
wearing
a
hood
the
colour
of
mucous
blood
over
a
robe
of
wan
blue
her
face
was
pale
and
swollen
with
weeping
and
she
stood
rigid
as
one
who
buries
his
fingernails
deep
into
his
palms
and
sobs
the
other
figure
was
that
of
saint
john
like
a
gipsy
or
sunburnt
swabian
peasant
very
tall
his
beard
matted
and
tangled
his
robe
of
a
scarlet
stuff
cut
in
wide
strips
like
slabs
of
bark
his
mantle
was
a
chamois
yellow
the
lining
caught
up
at
the
sleeves
showed
a
feverish
yellow
as
of
unripe
lemons
spent
with
weeping
but
possessed
of
more
endurance
than
mary
who
was
yet
erect
but
broken
and
exhausted
he
had
joined
his
hands
and
in
an
access
of
outraged
loyalty
had
drawn
himself
up
before
the
corpse
which
he
contemplated
with
his
red
and
smoky
eyes
while
he
choked
back
the
cry
which
threatened
to
rend
his
quivering
throat
ah
this
coarse
calvary
was
at
the
opposite
pole
from
those
debonair
golgothas
adopted
by
the
church
ever
since
the
renaissance
this
lockjaw
christ
was
not
the
christ
of
the
rich
the
adonis
of
galilee
the
exquisite
dandy
the
handsome
youth
with
the
curly
brown
tresses
divided
beard
and
insipid
features
whom
the
faithful
have
adored
for
four
centuries
this
was
the
christ
of
justin
basil
cyril
tertullian
the
christ
of
the
apostolic
church
the
vulgar
christ
ugly
with
the
assumption
of
the
whole
burden
of
our
sins
and
clothed
through
humility
in
the
most
abject
of
forms
it
was
the
christ
of
the
poor
the
christ
incarnate
in
the
image
of
the
most
miserable
of
us
he
came
to
save
the
christ
of
the
afflicted
of
the
beggar
of
all
those
on
whose
indigence
and
helplessness
the
greed
of
their
brother
battens
the
human
christ
frail
of
flesh
abandoned
by
the
father
until
such
time
as
no
further
torture
was
possible
the
christ
with
no
recourse
but
his
mother
to
whom
then
powerless
to
aid
him
he
had
like
every
man
in
torment
cried
out
with
an
infant
cry
in
an
unsparing
humility
doubtless
he
had
willed
to
suffer
the
passion
with
all
the
suffering
permitted
to
the
human
senses
and
obeying
an
incomprehensible
ordination
he
in
the
time
of
the
scourging
and
of
the
blows
and
of
the
insults
spat
in
his
face
had
put
off
divinity
nor
had
he
resumed
it
when
after
these
preliminary
mockeries
he
entered
upon
the
unspeakable
torment
of
the
unceasing
agony
thus
dying
like
a
thief
like
a
dog
basely
vilely
physically
he
had
sunk
himself
to
the
deepest
depth
of
fallen
humanity
and
had
not
spared
himself
the
last
ignominy
of
putrefaction
never
before
had
naturalism
transfigured
itself
by
such
a
conception
and
execution
never
before
had
a
painter
so
charnally
envisaged
divinity
nor
so
brutally
dipped
his
brush
into
the
wounds
and
running
sores
and
bleeding
nail
holes
of
the
saviour
grünewald
had
passed
all
measure
he
was
the
most
uncompromising
of
realists
but
his
morgue
redeemer
his

let
the
observer
know
that
realism
could
be
truly
transcendent
a
divine
light
played
about
that
ulcerated
head
a
superhuman
expression
illuminated
the
fermenting
skin
of
the
epileptic
features
this
crucified
corpse
was
a
very
god
and
without
aureole
without
nimbus
with
none
of
the
stock
accoutrements
except
the
crown
of
thorns
jesus
appeared
in
his
celestial
between
the
stunned
virgin
and
a
saint
john
whose
calcined
eyes
were
beyond
the
shedding
of
tears
these
faces
by
nature
vulgar
were
resplendent
transfigured
with
the
expression
of
the
sublime
grief
of
those
souls
whose
plaint
is
not
heard
thief
pauper
and
peasant
had
vanished
and
given
place
to
supraterrestial
creatures
in
the
presence
of
their
god
grünewald
was
the
most
uncompromising
of
idealists
never
had
artist
known
such
magnificent
exaltation
none
had
ever
so
resolutely
bounded
from
the
summit
of
spiritual
altitude
to
the
rapt
orb
of
heaven
he
had
gone
to
the
two
extremes
from
the
rankest
weeds
of
the
pit
he
had
extracted
the
finest
essence
of
charity
the
mordant
liquor
of
tears
in
this
canvas
was
revealed
the
masterpiece
of
an
art
obeying
the
unopposable
urge
to
render
the
tangible
and
the
invisible
to
make
manifest
the
crying
impurity
of
the
flesh
and
to
make
sublime
the
infinite
distress
of
the
soul
it
was
without
its
equivalent
in
literature
a
few
pages
of
anne
emmerich
upon
the
passion
though
comparatively
attenuated
approached
this
ideal
of
supernatural
realism
and
of
veridic
and
exsurrected
life
perhaps
too
certain
effusions
of
ruysbroeck
seeming
to
spurt
forth
in
twin
jets
of
black
and
white
flame
were
worthy
of
comparison
with
the
divine
befoulment
of
grünewald
hardly
either
grünewald
masterpiece
remained
unique
it
was
at
the
same
time
infinite
and
of
earth
earthy
but
said
durtal
to
himself
rousing
out
of
his
revery
if
i
am
consistent
i
shall
have
to
come
around
to
the
catholicism
of
the
middle
ages
to
naturalism
ah
no
i
will
not
and
yet
perhaps
i
may
here
he
was
in
the
old
dilemma
how
often
before
now
had
he
halted
on
the
threshold
of
catholicism
sounding
himself
thoroughly
and
finding
always
that
he
had
no
faith
decidedly
there
had
been
no
effort
on
the
part
of
god
to
reclaim
him
and
he
himself
had
never
possessed
the
kind
of
will
that
permits
one
to
let
oneself
go
trustingly
without
reserve
into
the
sheltering
shadows
of
immutable
dogma
momentarily
at
times
when
after
reading
certain
books
his
disgust
for
everyday
life
was
accentuated
he
longed
for
lenitive
hours
in
a
cloister
where
the
monotonous
chant
of
prayers
in
an
atmosphere
would
bring
on
a
somnolence
a
dreamy
rapture
of
mystical
ideas
but
only
a
simple
soul
on
which
life
wear
and
tear
had
left
no
mark
was
capable
of
savouring
the
delights
of
such
a
and
his
own
soul
was
battered
and
torn
with
earthly
conflict
he
must
admit
that
the
momentary
desire
to
believe
to
take
refuge
in
the
timeless
proceeded
from
a
multitude
of
ignoble
motives
from
lassitude
with
the
petty
and
repeated
annoyances
of
existence
quarrels
with
the
laundress
with
the
waiter
with
the
landlord
the
sordid
scramble
for
money
in
a
word
from
the
general
spiritual
failure
of
a
man
approaching
forty
he
thought
of
escaping
into
a
monastery
somewhat
as
street
girls
think
of
going
into
a
house
where
they
will
be
free
from
the
dangers
of
the
chase
from
worry
about
food
and
lodging
and
where
they
will
not
have
to
do
their
own
washing
and
ironing
unmarried
without
settled
income
the
voice
of
carnality
now
practically
stilled
in
him
he
sometimes
cursed
the
existence
he
had
shaped
for
himself
at
times
weary
of
attempting
to
coerce
words
to
do
his
bidding
he
threw
down
his
pen
and
looked
into
the
future
he
could
see
nothing
ahead
of
him
but
bitterness
and
cause
for
alarm
and
seeking
consolation
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
only
religion
could
heal
but
religion
demanded
in
return
so
arrant
a
desertion
of
common
sense
so
pusillanimous
a
willingness
to
be
astonished
at
nothing
that
he
threw
up
his
hands
and
begged
off
yet
he
was
always
playing
with
the
thought
indeed
he
could
not
escape
it
for
though
religion
was
without
foundation
it
was
also
without
limit
and
promised
a
complete
escape
from
earth
into
dizzy
unexplored
altitudes
then
too
durtal
was
attracted
to
the
church
by
its
intimate
and
ecstatic
art
the
splendour
of
its
legends
and
the
radiant
naïveté
of
the
histories
of
its
saints
he
did
not
believe
and
yet
he
admitted
the
supernatural
right
here
on
earth
how
could
any
of
us
deny
that
we
are
hemmed
in
by
mystery
in
our
homes
in
the
street
everywhere
when
we
came
to
think
of
it
it
was
really
the
part
of
shallowness
to
ignore
those
extrahuman
relations
and
account
for
the
unforeseen
by
attributing
to
fate
the
more
than
inexplicable
did
not
a
chance
encounter
often
decide
the
entire
life
of
a
man
what
was
love
what
the
other
incomprehensible
shaping
influences
and
knottiest
enigma
of
all
what
was
money
there
one
found
oneself
confronted
by
primordial
organic
law
atrocious
edicts
promulgated
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
world
and
applied
ever
since
the
rules
were
precise
and
invariable
money
attracted
money
accumulating
always
in
the
same
places
going
by
preference
to
the
scoundrelly
and
the
mediocre
when
by
an
inscrutable
exception
it
heaped
up
in
the
coffers
of
a
rich
man
who
was
not
a
miser
nor
a
murderer
it
stood
idle
incapable
of
resolving
itself
into
a
force
for
good
however
charitable
the
hands
which
fain
would
administer
it
one
would
say
it
was
angry
at
having
got
into
the
wrong
box
and
avenged
itself
by
going
into
voluntary
paralysis
when
possessed
by
one
who
was
neither
a
sharper
nor
an
ass
it
acted
still
more
strangely
when
by
some
extraordinary
chance
it
strayed
into
the
home
of
a
poor
man
immediately
it
defiled
the
clean
debauched
the
chaste
and
acting
simultaneously
on
the
body
and
the
soul
it
insinuated
into
its
possessor
a
base
selfishness
an
ignoble
pride
it
suggested
that
he
spend
for
himself
alone
it
made
the
humble
man
a
boor
the
generous
man
a
skinflint
in
one
second
it
changed
every
habit
revolutionized
every
idea
metamorphosed
the
most
deeply
rooted
passions
it
was
the
instigator
and
vigilant
accomplice
of
all
the
important
sins
if
it
permitted
one
of
its
detainers
to
forget
himself
and
bestow
a
boon
it
awakened
hatred
in
the
recipient
it
replaced
avarice
with
ingratitude
and
equilibrium
so
that
the
account
might
balance
and
not
one
sin
of
commission
be
wanting
but
it
reached
its
real
height
of
monstrosity
when
concealing
its
identity
under
an
assumed
name
it
entitled
itself
capital
then
its
action
was
not
limited
to
individual
incitation
to
theft
and
murder
but
extended
to
the
entire
human
race
with
one
word
capital
decided
monopolies
erected
banks
cornered
necessities
and
if
it
wished
caused
thousands
of
human
beings
to
starve
to
death
and
it
grew
and
begot
itself
while
slumbering
in
a
safe
and
the
two
worlds
adored
it
on
bended
knee
dying
of
desire
before
it
as
before
a
god
well
money
was
the
devil
otherwise
its
mastery
of
souls
was
inexplicable
and
how
many
other
mysteries
equally
unintelligible
how
many
other
phenomena
were
there
to
make
a
reflective
man
shudder
but
thought
durtal
seeing
that
there
are
so
many
more
things
betwixt
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamed
of
in
anybody
philosophy
why
not
believe
in
the
trinity
why
reject
the
divinity
of
christ
it
is
no
strain
on
one
to
admit
the
quia
of
saint
augustine
and
tertullian
and
say
that
if
the
supernatural
were
comprehensible
it
would
not
be
supernatural
and
that
precisely
because
it
passes
the
faculties
of
man
it
is
divine
and
oh
to
hell
with
it
what
it
all
about
anyway
and
again
as
so
often
when
he
had
found
himself
before
this
unbridgeable
gulf
between
reason
and
belief
he
recoiled
from
the
leap
well
his
thoughts
had
strayed
far
from
the
subject
of
that
naturalism
so
reviled
by
des
hermies
he
returned
to
grünewald
and
said
to
himself
that
the
great
crucifixion
was
the
masterpiece
of
an
art
driven
out
of
bounds
one
need
not
go
far
in
search
of
the
as
to
fall
into
perfervid
catholicism
perhaps
spiritualism
would
give
one
all
one
required
to
formulate
a
supernaturalistic
method
he
rose
and
went
into
his
tiny
workroom
his
pile
of
manuscript
notes
about
the
marshal
de
rais
surnamed
bluebeard
looked
at
him
derisively
from
the
table
where
they
were
piled
all
the
same
he
said
it
good
to
be
here
in
out
of
the
world
and
above
the
limits
of
time
to
live
in
another
age
never
read
a
newspaper
not
even
know
that
the
theatres
exist
ah
what
a
dream
to
dwell
with
bluebeard
and
forget
the
grocer
on
the
corner
and
all
the
other
petty
little
criminals
of
an
age
perfectly
typified
by
the
café
waiter
who
ravishes
the
boss
daughter
the
goose
who
lays
the
golden
egg
as
he
calls
her
so
that
she
will
have
to
marry
him
bed
was
a
good
place
he
added
smiling
for
he
saw
his
cat
a
creature
with
a
perfect
time
sense
regarding
him
uneasily
as
if
to
remind
him
of
their
common
convenience
and
to
reproach
him
for
not
having
prepared
the
couch
durtal
arranged
the
pillows
and
pulled
back
the
coverlet
and
the
cat
jumped
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
but
remained
humped
up
tail
coiled
beneath
him
waiting
till
his
master
was
stretched
out
at
length
before
burrowing
a
little
hollow
to
curl
up
in
chapter
ii
nearly
two
years
ago
durtal
had
ceased
to
associate
with
men
of
letters
they
were
represented
in
books
and
in
the
columns
of
magazines
as
forming
an
aristocracy
which
had
a
monopoly
on
intelligence
their
conversation
if
one
believed
what
one
read
sparkled
with
effervescent
and
stimulating
wit
durtal
had
difficulty
accounting
to
himself
for
the
persistence
of
this
illusion
his
sad
experience
led
him
to
believe
that
every
literary
man
belonged
to
one
of
two
classes
the
thoroughly
commercial
or
the
utterly
impossible
the
first
consisted
of
writers
spoiled
by
the
public
and
drained
dry
in
consequence
but
successful
ravenous
for
notice
they
aped
the
ways
of
the
world
of
big
business
delighted
in
gala
dinners
gave
formal
evening
parties
spoke
of
copyrights
sales
and
long
run
plays
and
made
great
display
of
wealth
the
second
consisted
of
café
loafers
bohemians
rolling
on
the
benches
gorged
with
beer
they
feigned
an
exaggerated
modesty
and
at
the
same
time
cried
their
wares
aired
their
genius
and
abused
their
betters
there
was
now
no
place
where
one
could
meet
a
few
artists
and
privately
intimately
discuss
ideas
at
ease
one
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
café
crowd
or
the
company
one
interlocutor
was
listening
avidly
to
steal
one
ideas
and
behind
one
back
one
was
being
vituperated
and
the
women
were
always
intruding
in
this
indiscriminate
world
there
was
no
illuminating
criticism
nothing
but
small
talk
elegant
or
inelegant
then
durtal
learned
also
by
experience
that
one
can
not
associate
with
thieves
without
becoming
either
a
thief
or
a
dupe
and
finally
he
broke
off
relations
with
his
confrères
he
not
only
had
no
sympathy
but
no
common
topic
of
conversation
with
them
formerly
when
he
accepted
naturalism
airtight
and
unsatisfactory
as
it
was
he
had
been
able
to
argue
esthetics
with
them
but
now
the
point
is
des
hermies
was
always
telling
him
that
there
is
a
basic
difference
between
you
and
the
other
realists
and
no
alliance
could
possibly
be
of
long
duration
you
execrate
the
age
and
they
worship
it
there
is
the
whole
matter
you
were
fated
some
day
to
get
away
from
this
americanized
art
and
attempt
to
create
something
less
vulgar
less
miserably
commonplace
and
infuse
a
little
spirituality
into
it
in
all
your
books
you
have
fallen
on
our
de
our
du
tooth
and
nail
but
lord
a
man
soon
gets
tired
of
whacking
something
that
does
fight
back
but
merely
goes
its
own
way
repeating
its
offences
you
needed
to
escape
into
another
epoch
and
get
your
bearings
while
waiting
for
a
congenial
subject
to
present
itself
that
explains
your
spiritual
disarray
of
the
last
few
months
and
your
immediate
recovery
as
soon
as
you
stumbled
onto
giles
de
rais
des
hermies
had
diagnosed
him
accurately
the
day
on
which
durtal
had
plunged
into
the
frightful
and
delightful
latter
mediæval
age
had
been
the
dawn
of
a
new
existence
the
flouting
of
his
actual
surroundings
brought
peace
to
durtal
soul
and
he
had
completely
reorganized
his
life
mentally
cloistering
himself
far
from
the
furore
of
contemporary
letters
in
the
château
de
tiffauges
with
the
monster
bluebeard
with
whom
he
lived
in
perfect
accord
even
in
mischievous
amity
thus
history
had
for
durtal
supplanted
the
novel
whose
forced
banality
conventionality
and
tidy
structure
of
plot
simply
griped
him
yet
history
too
was
only
a
peg
for
a
man
of
talent
to
hang
style
and
ideas
on
for
events
could
not
fail
to
be
coloured
by
the
temperament
and
distorted
by
the
bias
of
the
historian
as
for
the
documents
and
sources
well
attested
as
they
might
be
they
were
all
subject
to
revision
even
to
contradiction
by
others
exhumed
later
which
were
no
less
authentic
than
the
first
and
which
also
but
waited
their
turn
to
be
refuted
by
newer
discoveries
in
the
present
rage
for
grubbing
around
in
dusty
archives
writing
of
history
served
as
an
outlet
for
the
pedantry
of
the
moles
who
reworked
their
mouldy
findings
and
were
duly
rewarded
by
the
institute
with
medals
and
diplomas
for
durtal
history
was
then
the
most
pretentious
as
it
was
the
most
infantile
of
deceptions
old
clio
ought
to
be
represented
with
a
sphinx
head
whiskers
and
one
of
those
padded
bonnets
which
babies
wore
to
keep
them
from
bashing
their
little
brains
out
when
they
took
a
tumble
of
course
exactitude
was
impossible
why
should
he
dream
of
getting
at
the
whole
truth
about
the
middle
ages
when
nobody
had
been
able
to
give
a
full
account
of
the
revolution
of
the
commune
for
that
matter
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
imagine
himself
in
the
midst
of
creatures
of
that
other
epoch
wearing
their
antique
garb
thinking
their
thoughts
and
then
having
saturated
himself
with
their
spirit
to
convey
his
illusion
by
means
of
adroitly
selected
details
that
is
practically
what
michelet
did
and
though
the
garrulous
old
gossip
drivelled
endlessly
about
matters
of
supreme
unimportance
and
ecstasized
in
his
mild
way
over
trivial
anecdotes
which
he
expanded
beyond
all
proportion
and
though
his
sentimentality
and
chauvinism
sometimes
discredited
his
quite
plausible
conjectures
he
was
nevertheless
the
only
french
historian
who
had
overcome
the
limitation
of
time
and
made
another
age
live
anew
before
our
eyes
hysterical
garrulous
manneristic
as
he
was
there
was
yet
a
truly
epic
sweep
in
certain
passages
of
his
history
of
france
the
personages
were
raised
from
the
oblivion
into
which
the
professors
had
sunk
them
and
became
live
human
beings
what
matter
then
if
michelet
was
the
least
trustworthy
of
historians
since
he
was
the
most
personal
and
the
most
evocative
as
for
the
others
they
simply
ferreted
around
among
the
old
state
papers
clipped
them
and
following
taine
example
arranged
ticketed
and
mounted
their
sensational
gleanings
in
logical
sequence
rejecting
of
course
everything
that
did
not
advance
the
case
they
were
trying
to
make
they
denied
themselves
imagination
and
enthusiasm
and
claimed
that
they
did
not
invent
true
enough
but
they
did
none
the
less
distort
history
by
the
selection
they
employed
and
how
simply
and
summarily
they
disposed
of
things
it
was
discovered
that
such
and
such
an
event
occurred
in
france
in
several
communities
and
straightway
it
was
decided
that
the
whole
country
lived
acted
and
thought
in
a
certain
manner
at
a
certain
hour
on
a
certain
day
in
a
certain
year
no
less
than
michelet
they
were
doughty
falsifiers
but
they
lacked
his
vision
they
dealt
in
knickknacks
and
their
trivialities
were
as
far
from
creating
a
unified
impression
as
were
the
pointillistic
puzzles
of
modern
painters
and
the
word
hashes
cooked
up
by
the
decadent
poets
and
worst
of
all
thought
durtal
the
biographers
the
depilators
taking
all
the
hair
off
a
real
man
chest
they
wrote
ponderous
tomes
to
prove
that
jan
steen
was
a
teetotaler
somebody
had
deloused
villon
and
shown
that
the
grosse
margot
of
the
ballade
was
not
a
woman
but
an
inn
sign
pretty
soon
they
would
be
representing
the
poet
as
a
priggishly
honest
and
judicious
man
one
would
say
that
in
writing
their
monographs
these
historians
feared
to
dishonour
themselves
by
treating
of
artists
who
had
tasted
somewhat
fully
and
passionately
of
life
hence
the
expurgation
of
masterpieces
that
an
artist
might
appear
as
commonplace
a
bourgeois
as
his
commentator
this
rehabilitation
school
today
exasperated
durtal
in
writing
his
study
of
gilles
de
rais
he
was
not
going
to
fall
into
the
error
of
these
bigoted
sustainers
of
morality
with
his
ideas
of
history
he
could
not
claim
to
give
an
exact
likeness
of
bluebeard
but
he
was
not
going
to
concede
to
the
public
taste
for
mediocrity
in
by
whitewashing
the
man
durtal
material
for
this
study
consisted
of
a
copy
of
the
memorial
addressed
by
the
heirs
of
gilles
de
rais
to
the
king
notes
taken
from
the
several
true
copies
at
paris
of
the
proceedings
in
the
criminal
trial
at
nantes
extracts
from
vallet
de
viriville
history
of
charles
vii
finally
the
by
armand
guéraut
and
the
biography
of
the
abbé
bossard
these
sufficed
to
bring
before
durtal
eyes
the
formidable
figure
of
that
satanic
fifteenth
century
character
who
was
the
most
artistically
exquisitely
cruel
and
the
most
scoundrelly
of
men
no
one
knew
of
the
projected
study
but
des
hermies
whom
durtal
saw
nearly
every
day
they
had
met
in
the
strangest
of
homes
that
of
chantelouve
the
catholic
historian
who
boasted
of
receiving
all
classes
of
people
and
every
week
in
the
social
season
that
in
the
rue
de
bagneux
was
the
scene
of
a
heterogeneous
gathering
of
under
sacristans
café
poets
journalists
actresses
partisans
of
the
cause
of
naundorff
and
dabblers
in
equivocal
sciences

bade
everyone
make

through
his
smoked
spectacles
there
stole
an
ambiguous
look

might
have
given
an

pause

the
man
bonhomie
quite
ecclesiastical
was
instantly
disarming
madame
was
no

but
possessed
a
certain
bizarre
charm
and
was
always
surrounded
she
however
remained
silent
and
did
nothing
to
encourage
her
voluble
admirers
as
void
of
prudery
as
her
husband
she
listened
impassively
absently
with
her
thoughts
evidently
afar
to
the
boldest
of
conversational
imprudences
at
one
of
these
evening
parties
while
la
rousseil
recently
converted
howled
a
hymn
durtal
sitting
in
a
corner
having
a
quiet
smoke
had
been
struck
by
the
physiognomy
and
bearing
of
des
hermies
who
stood
out
sharply
from
the
motley
throng
of
defrocked
priests
and
grubby
poets
packed
into
chantelouve
library
and
among
these
smirking
and
carefully
composed
faces
des
hermies
evidently
a
man
of
forceful
individuality
seemed
and
probably
felt
singularly
out
of
place
he
was
tall
slender
somewhat
pale
his
eyes
narrowed
in
a
frown
had
the
cold
blue
gleam
of
sapphires
the
nose
was
short
and
sharp
the
cheeks
smooth
shaven
with
his
flaxen
hair
and
vandyke
he
might
have
been
a
norwegian
or
an
englishman
in
not
very
good
health
his
garments
were
of
london
make
and
the
long
tight
coat
buttoned
clear
up
to
the
neck
seemed
to
enclose
him
like
a
box
very
careful
of
his
person
he
had
a
manner
all
his
own
of
drawing
off
his
gloves
rolling
them
up
with
an
almost
inaudible
crackling
then
seating
himself
crossing
his
long
thin
legs
and
leaning
over
to
the
right
reaching
into
the
patch
pocket
on
his
left
side
and
bringing
forth
the
embossed
japanese
pouch
which
contained
his
tobacco
and
cigarette
papers
he
was
methodic
guarded
and
very
cold
in
the
presence
of
strangers
his
superior
and
somewhat
bored
attitude
not
exactly
relieved
by
his
curt
dry
laugh
awakened
at
a
first
meeting
a
serious
antipathy
which
he
sometimes
justified
by
venomous
words
by
meaningless
silences
by
unspoken
innuendoes
he
was
respected
and
feared
at
chantelouve
but
when
one
came
to
know
him
one
found
beneath
his
defensive
shell
great
warmth
of
heart
and
a
capacity
for
true
friendship
of
the
kind
that
is
not
expansive
but
is
capable
of
sacrifice
and
can
always
be
relied
upon
how
did
he
live
was
he
rich
or
just
comfortable
no
one
knew
and
he
tight
lipped
never
spoke
of
his
affairs
he
was
doctor
of
the
faculty
of
paris
durtal
had
chanced
to
see
his
diploma
but
he
spoke
of
medicine
with
great
disdain
he
said
he
had
become
convinced
of
the
futility
of
all
he
had
been
taught
and
had
thrown
it
over
for
homeopathy
which
in
turn
he
had
thrown
over
for
a
bolognese
system
and
this
last
he
was
now
excoriating
there
were
times
when
durtal
could
not
doubt
that
his
friend
was
an
author
for
des
hermies
spoke
understandingly
of
tricks
of
the
trade
which
one
learns
only
after
long
experience
and
his
literary
judgment
was
not
that
of
a
layman
when
one
day
durtal
reproached
him
for
concealing
his
productions
he
replied
with
a
certain
melancholy
no
i
caught
myself
in
time
to
choke
down
a
base
instinct
the
desire
of
resaying
what
has
been
said
i
could
have
plagiarized
flaubert
as
well
as
if
not
better
than
the
poll
parrots
who
are
doing
it
but
i
decided
not
to
i
would
rather
phrase
abstruse
medicaments
of
rare
application
perhaps
it
is
not
very
necessary
but
at
least
it
is
cheap
what
surprised
durtal
was
his
friend
prodigious
erudition
des
hermies
had
the
run
of
the
most
book
shops
he
was
an
authority
on
antique
customs
and
at
the
same
time
on
the
latest
scientific
discoveries
he
hobnobbed
with
all
the
freaks
in
paris
and
from
them
he
became
deeply
learned
in
the
most
diverse
and
hostile
sciences
he
so
cold
and
correct
was
almost
never
to
be
found
save
in
the
company
of
astrologers
cabbalists
demonologists
alchemists
theologians
or
inventors
weary
of
the
advances
and
the
facile
intimacies
of
artists
durtal
had
been
attracted
by
this
man
fastidious
reserve
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
durtal
surfeited
with
friendships
should
feel
drawn
to
des
hermies
but
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
why
des
hermies
with
his
taste
for
strange
associations
should
take
a
liking
to
durtal
who
was
the
soberest
steadiest
most
normal
of
men
perhaps
des
hermies
felt
the
need
of
talking
with
a
sane
human
being
now
and
then
as
a
relief
and
too
the
literary
discussions
which
he
loved
were
out
of
the
question
with
these
addlepates
who
monologued
indefatigably
on
the
subject
of
their
monomania
and
their
ego
at
odds
like
durtal
with
his
confrères
des
hermies
could
expect
nothing
from
the
physicians
whom
he
avoided
nor
from
the
specialists
with
whom
he
consorted
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
had
been
a
juncture
of
two
beings
whose
situation
was
almost
identical
at
first
restrained
and
on
the
defensive
they
had
come
finally
to
each
other
and
establish
a
relation
which
had
been
a
great
advantage
to
durtal
his
family
were
dead
the
friends
of
his
youth
married
and
scattered
and
since
his
withdrawal
from
the
world
of
letters
he
had
been
reduced
to
complete
solitude
des
hermies
kept
him
from
going
stale
and
then
finding
that
durtal
had
not
lost
all
interest
in
mankind
promised
to
introduce
him
to
a
really
lovable
old
character
of
this
man
des
hermies
spoke
much
and
one
day
he
said
you
really
ought
to
know
him
he
likes
the
books
of
yours
which
i
have
lent
him
and
he
wants
to
meet
you
you
think
i
am
interested
only
in
obscure
and
twisted
natures
well
you
will
find
carhaix
really
unique
he
is
the
one
catholic
with
intelligence
and
without
sanctimoniousness
the
one
poor
man
with
envy
and
hatred
for
none
chapter
iii
durtal
was
in
a
situation
familiar
to
all
bachelors
who
have
the
concierge
do
their
cleaning
only
these
know
how
a
tiny
lamp
can
fairly
drink
up
oil
and
how
the
contents
of
a
bottle
of
cognac
can
become
paler
and
weaker
without
ever
diminishing
they
know
too
how
a
once
comfortable
bed
can
become
forbidding
and
how
scrupulously
a
concierge
can
respect
its
least
fold
or
crease
they
learn
to
be
resigned
and
to
wash
out
a
glass
when
they
are
thirsty
and
make
their
own
fire
when
they
are
cold
durtal
concierge
was
an
old
man
with
drooping
moustache
and
a
powerful
breath
of
indolent
and
placid
he
opposed
an
unbudgeable
inertia
to
durtal
frantic
and
profanely
expressed
demand
that
the
sweeping
be
done
at
the
same
hour
every
morning
threats
prayers
insults
the
withholding
of
gratuities
were
without
effect
père
rateau
took
off
his
cap
scratched
his
head
promised
in
the
tone
of
a
man
much
moved
to
mend
his
ways
and
next
day
came
later
than
ever
what
a
nuisance
thought
durtal
today
as
he
heard
a
key
turning
in
the
lock
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
observed
that
once
again
the
concierge
was
arriving
after
three
in
the
afternoon
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit
with
a
sigh
to
the
ensuing
hullabaloo
rateau
somnolent
and
pacific
in
his
lodge
became
a
demon
when
he
got
a
broom
in
his
hand
in
this
sedentary
being
who
could
drowse
all
morning
in
the
stale
basement
atmosphere
heavy
with
the
cumulative
aroma
of
many
a
martial
ardour
a
warlike
ferocity
then
asserted
themselves
and
like
a
red
revolutionary
he
assaulted
the
bed
charged
the
chairs
manhandled
the
picture
frames
knocked
the
tables
over
rattled
the
water
pitcher
and
whirled
brogues
about
by
the
laces
as
when
a
pillaging
conqueror
hauls
a
ravished
victim
along
by
the
hair
so
he
stormed
the
apartment
like
a
barricade
and
triumphantly
brandished
his
battle
standard
the
dust
rag
over
the
reeking
carnage
of
the
furniture
durtal
at
such
times
sought
refuge
in
the
room
which
was
not
being
attacked
today
rateau
launched
his
offensive
against
the
workroom
so
durtal
fled
to
the
bedroom
from
there
through
the
half
open
door
he
could
see
the
enemy
with
a
feather
duster
like
a
mohican
war
bonnet
over
his
head
doing
a
scalp
dance
around
a
table
if
i
only
knew
at
what
time
that
pest
would
break
in
on
me
so
i
could
always
arrange
to
be
out
groaned
durtal
now
he
ground
his
teeth
as
rateau
with
a
yell
grabbed
up
the
mop
and
skating
around
on
one
leg
belaboured
the
floor
lustily
the
perspiring
conqueror
then
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
advanced
to
reduce
the
chamber
where
durtal
was
the
latter
had
to
return
to
the
subjugated
workroom
and
the
cat
shocked
by
the
racket
arched
its
back
and
rubbing
against
its
master
legs
followed
him
to
a
place
of
safety
in
the
thick
of
the
conflict
des
hermies
rang
the
door
bell
i
put
on
my
shoes
cried
durtal
and
we
get
out
of
this
look
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
table
and
brought
back
a
coat
of
grime
that
made
him
appear
to
be
wearing
a
grey
glove
look
that
brute
turns
the
house
upside
down
and
knocks
everything
to
pieces
and
the
result
he
leaves
more
dust
when
he
goes
than
he
found
when
he
came
in
bah
said
des
hermies
dust
is
a
bad
thing
besides
having
the
taste
of
ancient
biscuit
and
the
smell
of
an
old
book
it
is
the
floating
velvet
which
softens
hard
surfaces
the
fine
dry
wash
which
takes
the
garishness
out
of
crude
colour
schemes
it
is
the
caparison
of
abandon
the
veil
of
oblivion
who
then
can
despise
it
aside
from
certain
persons
whose
lamentable
lot
must
often
have
wrung
a
tear
from
you
imagine
living
in
one
of
these
paris
think
of
a
consumptive
spitting
blood
and
suffocating
in
a
room
one
flight
up
behind
the
gables
of
say
the
passage
des
panoramas
for
instance
when
the
window
is
open
the
dust
comes
in
impregnated
with
snuff
and
saturated
with
clammy
exudations
the
invalid
choking
begs
for
air
and
in
order
that
he
may
breathe
the
window
is
well
the
dust
that
you
complain
of
is
rather
milder
than
that
anyway
i
do
hear
you
coughing
but
if
you
ready
we
be
on
our
way
where
shall
we
go
asked
durtal
des
hermies
did
not
answer
they
left
the
rue
du
regard
in
which
durtal
lived
and
went
down
the
rue
du
as
far
as
the
let
go
on
to
the
place
said
des
hermies
and
after
a
silence
he
continued
speaking
of
dust
of
which
we
came
and
to
which
we
shall
return
do
you
know
that
after
we
are
dead
our
corpses
are
devoured
by
different
kinds
of
worms
according
as
we
are
fat
or
thin
in
fat
corpses
one
species
of
maggot
is
found
the
rhizophagus
while
thin
corpses
are
patronized
only
by
the
phora
the
latter
is
evidently
the
aristocrat
the
fastidious
gourmet
which
turns
up
its
nose
at
a
heavy
meal
of
copious
breasts
and
juicy
fat
bellies
just
think
there
is
no
perfect
equality
even
in
the
manner
in
which
we
feed
the
worms
but
this
is
where
we
stop
they
had
come
to
where
the
rue
férou
opens
into
the
place
durtal
looked
up
and
on
an
unenclosed
porch
in
the
flank
of
the
church
of
he
read
the
placard
tower
open
to
visitors
let
go
up
said
des
hermies
what
for
in
this
weather
and
durtal
pointed
at
the
yellow
sky
over
which
black
clouds
like
factory
smoke
were
racing
so
low
that
the
tin
chimneys
seemed
to
penetrate
them
and
crenelate
them
with
little
spots
of
clarity
i
am
not
enthusiastic
about
trying
to
climb
a
flight
of
broken
irregular
stairs
and
anyway
what
do
you
think
you
can
see
up
there
it
misty
and
getting
dark
no
have
a
heart
what
difference
is
it
to
you
where
you
take
your
airing
come
on
i
assure
you
you
will
see
something
unusual
oh
you
brought
me
here
on
purpose
yes
why
did
you
say
so
he
followed
des
hermies
into
the
darkness
under
the
porch
at
the
back
of
the
cellarway
a
little
essence
lamp
hanging
from
a
nail
lighted
a
door
the
tower
entrance
for
a
long
time
in
utter
darkness
they
climbed
a
winding
stair
durtal
was
wondering
where
the
keeper
had
gone
when
turning
a
corner
he
saw
a
shaft
of
light
then
he
stumbled
against
the
rickety
supports
of
a
lamp
in
front
of
a
door
des
hermies
pulled
a
bell
cord
and
the
door
swung
back
above
them
on
a
landing
they
could
see
feet
whether
of
a
man
or
of
a
woman
they
could
not
tell
ah
it
you
des
hermies
and
a
woman
bent
over
describing
an
arc
so
that
her
head
was
in
a
stream
of
light
louis
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
is
he
in
asked
des
hermies
reaching
up
and
shaking
hands
with
the
woman
he
is
in
the
tower
wo
you
stop
and
rest
a
minute
why
when
we
come
down
if
you
do
mind
then
go
up
until
you
see
a
grated
door
but
what
an
old
fool
i
am
you
know
the
way
as
well
as
i
do
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
but
in
passing
permit
me
to
introduce
my
friend
durtal
durtal
somewhat
flustered
made
a
bow
in
the
darkness
ah
monsieur
how
fortunate
louis
is
so
anxious
to
meet
you
where
is
he
taking
me
durtal
wondered
as
again
he
groped
along
behind
his
friend
now
and
then
just
as
he
felt
completely
lost
coming
to
the
narrow
strip
of
light
admitted
by
a
barbican
and
again
proceeding
in
inky
darkness
the
climb
seemed
endless
finally
they
came
to
the
barred
door
opened
it
and
found
themselves
on
a
frame
balcony
with
the
abyss
above
and
below
des
hermies
who
seemed
perfectly
at
home
pointed
downward
then
upward
they
were
halfway
up
a
tower
the
face
of
which
was
overlaid
with
enormous
joists
and
beams
riveted
together
with
bolt
heads
as
big
as
a
man
fist
durtal
could
see
no
one
he
turned
and
clinging
to
the
hand
rail
groped
along
the
wall
toward
the
daylight
which
stole
down
between
the
inclined
leaves
of
the
leaning
out
over
the
precipice
he
discerned
beneath
him
a
formidable
array
of
bells
hanging
from
oak
supports
lined
with
iron
the
sombre
bell
metal
was
slick
as
if
oiled
and
absorbed
light
without
refracting
it
bending
backward
he
looked
into
the
upper
abyss
and
perceived
new
batteries
of
bells
overhead
these
bore
the
raised
effigy
of
a
bishop
and
a
place
in
each
worn
by
the
striking
of
the
clapper
shone
golden
all
were
in
quiescence
but
the
wind
rattled
against
the
stormed
through
the
cage
of
timbers
howled
along
the
spiral
stair
and
was
caught
and
held
whining
in
the
bell
vases
suddenly
a
light
breeze
like
the
stirring
of
confined
air
fanned
his
cheek
he
looked
up
the
current
had
been
set
in
motion
by
the
swaying
of
a
great
bell
beginning
to
get
under
way
there
was
a
crash
of
sound
the
bell
gathered
momentum
and
now
the
clapper
like
a
gigantic
pestle
was
grinding
the
great
bronze
mortar
with
a
deafening
clamour
the
tower
trembled
the
balcony
on
which
durtal
was
standing
trepidated
like
the
floor
of
a
railway
coach
there
was
the
continuous
rolling
of
a
mighty
reverberation
interrupted
regularly
by
the
jar
of
metal
upon
metal
in
vain
durtal
scanned
the
upper
abyss
finally
he
managed
to
catch
sight
of
a
leg
swinging
out
into
space
and
back
again
in
one
of
those
wooden
stirrups
two
of
which
he
had
noticed
were
fastened
to
the
bottom
of
every
bell
leaning
out
so
that
he
was
almost
prone
on
one
of
the
timbers
he
finally
perceived
the
ringer
clinging
with
his
hands
to
two
iron
handles
and
balancing
over
the
gulf
with
his
eyes
turned
heavenward
durtal
was
shocked
by
the
face
never
had
he
seen
such
disconcerting
pallor
it
was
not
the
waxen
hue
of
the
convalescent
not
the
lifeless
grey
of
the
it
was
a
prison
pallor
of
a
bloodless
lividness
unknown
today
the
ghastly
complexion
of
a
wretch
of
the
middle
ages
shut
up
till
death
in
a
damp
airless
the
eyes
were
blue
prominent
even
bulging
and
had
the
readiness
to
tears
but
their
expression
was
singularly
contradicted
by
the
truculent
kaiser
wilhelm
moustache
the
man
seemed
at
once
a
dreamer
and
a
fighter
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
tell
which
character
predominated
he
gave
the
bell
stirrup
a
last
yank
with
his
foot
and
with
a
heave
of
his
loins
regained
his
equilibrium
he
mopped
his
brow
and
smiled
down
at
des
hermies
well
well
he
said
you
here
he
descended
and
when
he
learned
durtal
name
his
face
brightened
and
the
two
shook
hands
cordially
we
have
been
expecting
you
a
long
time
monsieur
our
friend
here
speaks
of
you
at
great
length
and
we
have
been
asking
him
why
he
bring
you
around
to
see
us
but
come
he
said
eagerly
i
must
conduct
you
on
a
tour
of
inspection
about
my
little
domain
i
have
read
your
books
and
i
know
a
man
like
you
ca
help
falling
in
love
with
my
bells
but
we
must
go
higher
if
we
are
really
to
see
them
and
he
bounded
up
a
staircase
while
des
hermies
pushed
durtal
along
in
front
of
him
in
a
way
that
made
retreat
impossible
as
he
was
once
more
groping
along
the
winding
stairs
durtal
asked
why
did
you
tell
me
your
friend
carhaix
for
of
course
that
who
he
is
was
a
des
hermies
did
not
have
time
to
answer
for
at
that
moment
having
reached
the
door
of
the
room
beneath
the
tower
roof
carhaix
was
standing
aside
to
let
them
pass
they
were
in
a
rotunda
pierced
in
the
centre
by
a
great
circular
hole
which
had
around
it
a
corroded
iron
balustrade
orange
with
rust
by
standing
close
to
the
railing
which
was
like
the
well
curb
of
the
pit
one
could
see
down
down
to
the
foundation
the
well
seemed
to
be
undergoing
repairs
and
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
tube
the
beams
supporting
the
bells
were
crisscrossed
with
timbers
bracing
the
walls
do
be
afraid
to
lean
over
said
carhaix
now
tell
me
monsieur
how
do
you
like
my
foster
children
but
durtal
was
hardly
heeding
he
felt
uneasy
here
in
space
and
as
if
drawn
toward
the
gaping
chasm
whence
ascended
from
time
to
time
the
desultory
clanging
of
the
bell
which
was
still
swaying
and
would
be
some
time
in
returning
to
immobility
he
recoiled
would
you
like
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
top
of
the
tower
asked
carhaix
pointing
to
an
iron
stair
sealed
into
the
wall
no
another
day
they
descended
and
carhaix
in
silence
opened
a
door
they
advanced
into
an
immense
storeroom
containing
colossal
broken
statues
of
saints
scaly
and
dilapidated
apostles
saint
matthew
legless
and
armless
saint
luke
escorted
by
a
fragmentary
ox
saint
mark
lacking
a
shoulder
and
part
of
his
beard
saint
peter
holding
up
an
arm
from
which
the
hand
holding
the
keys
was
broken
off
there
used
to
be
a
swing
in
here
said
carhaix
for
the
little
girls
of
the
neighbourhood
but
the
privilege
was
abused
as
privileges
always
are
in
the
dusk
all
kinds
of
things
were
done
for
a
few
sous
the
curate
finally
had
the
swing
taken
down
and
the
room
closed
up
and
what
is
that
over
there
inquired
durtal
perceiving
in
a
corner
an
enormous
fragment
of
rounded
metal
like
half
a
gigantic
on
it
the
dust
lay
thick
and
and
in
the
hollow
the
meshes
on
meshes
of
fine
silken
web
dotted
with
the
black
bodies
of
lurking
spiders
were
like
a
fisherman
hand
net
weighted
with
little
slugs
of
lead
that
ah
monsieur
and
there
was
fire
in
carhaix
mild
eyes
that
is
the
skull
of
an
old
old
bell
whose
like
is
not
cast
these
days
the
ring
of
that
bell
monsieur
was
like
a
voice
from
heaven
and
suddenly
he
exploded
bells
have
had
their
day
as
i
suppose
des
hermies
has
told
bell
ringing
is
a
lost
art
and
why
would
it
be
look
at
the
men
who
are
doing
it
nowadays
charcoal
burners
roofers
masons
out
of
a
job
discharged
firemen
ready
to
try
their
hand
at
anything
for
a
franc
there
are
curates
who
think
nothing
of
saying
a
man
go
out
in
the
street
and
pick
up
a
soldier
for
ten
sous
he
do
why
you
read
about
accidents
like
the
one
that
happened
lately
at
notre
dame
i
think
the
fellow
did
withdraw
in
time
and
the
bell
came
down
like
the
blade
of
a
guillotine
and
whacked
his
leg
right
off
people
will
spend
thirty
thousand
francs
on
an
altar
baldachin
and
ruin
themselves
for
music
and
they
have
to
have
gas
in
their
churches
and
lord
knows
what
all
besides
but
when
you
mention
bells
they
shrug
their
shoulders
do
you
know
durtal
there
are
only
two
men
in
paris
who
can
ring
chords
myself
and
père
michel
and
he
is
not
married
and
his
morals
are
so
bad
that
he
ca
be
regularly
attached
to
a
church
he
can
ring
music
the
like
of
which
you
never
heard
but
he
too
is
losing
interest
he
drinks
and
drunk
or
sober
goes
to
work
then
he
bowls
up
again
and
goes
to
sleep
yes
the
bell
has
had
its
day
why
this
very
morning
monsignor
made
his
pastoral
visit
to
this
church
at
eight
we
sounded
his
arrival
the
six
bells
you
see
down
here
boomed
out
melodiously
but
there
were
sixteen
up
above
and
it
was
a
shame
those
extras
jangled
away
haphazard
it
was
a
riot
of
discord
carhaix
ruminated
in
silence
as
they
descended
then
ah
monsieur
he
said
his
watery
eyes
fairly
bubbling
the
ring
of
bells
there
your
real
sacred
music
they
were
now
above
the
main
door
of
the
building
and
they
came
out
into
the
great
covered
gallery
on
which
the
towers
rest
carhaix
smiled
and
pointed
out
a
complete
peal
of
miniature
bells
installed
between
two
pillars
on
a
plank
he
pulled
the
cords
and
in
ecstasies
his
eyes
protruding
his
moustache
bristling
he
listened
to
the
frail
tinkling
of
his
toy
and
suddenly
he
relinquished
the
cords
i
once
had
a
crazy
idea
he
said
of
forming
a
class
here
and
teaching
all
the
intricacies
of
the
craft
but
no
one
cared
to
learn
a
trade
which
was
steadily
going
out
of
existence
why
you
know
we
even
sound
for
weddings
any
more
and
nobody
comes
to
look
at
the
tower
but
i
really
ca
complain
i
hate
the
streets
when
i
try
to
cross
one
i
lose
my
head
so
i
stay
in
the
tower
all
day
except
once
in
the
early
morning
when
i
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
square
for
a
bucket
of
water
now
my
wife
does
like
it
up
here
you
see
the
snow
does
come
in
through
all
the
loopholes
and
it
heaps
up
and
sometimes
we
are
snowbound
with
the
wind
blowing
a
gale
they
had
come
to
carhaix
lodge
his
wife
was
waiting
for
them
on
the
threshold
come
in
gentlemen
she
said
you
have
certainly
earned
some
refreshment
and
she
pointed
to
four
glasses
which
she
had
set
out
on
the
table
the
lighted
a
little
briar
pipe
while
des
hermies
and
durtal
each
rolled
a
cigarette
pretty
comfortable
place
remarked
durtal
just
to
be
saying
something
it
was
a
vast
room
vaulted
with
walls
of
rough
stone
and
lighted
by
a
window
just
under
the
ceiling
the
tiled
floor
was
badly
covered
by
an
infamous
carpet
and
the
furniture
very
simple
consisted
of
a
round
table
some
old
armchairs
covered
with
utrecht
velours
a
little
stained
walnut
sideboard
on
which
were
several
plates
and
pitchers
of
breton
faience
and
opposite
the
sideboard
a
little
black
bookcase
which
might
contain
fifty
books
of
course
a
literary
man
would
be
interested
in
the
books
said
carhaix
who
had
been
watching
durtal
you
must
be
too
critical
monsieur
i
have
only
the
tools
of
my
trade
durtal
went
over
and
took
a
look
the
collection
consisted
largely
of
works
on
bells
he
read
some
of
the
titles
on
the
cover
of
a
slim
parchment
volume
he
deciphered
the
faded
legend
in
ink
by
jerome
magius
then
there
were
curious
and
edifying
miscellany
concerning
church
by
dom
rémi
carré
another
anonymous
a
of
by
thiers
curate
of
champrond
and
vibraye
a
ponderous
tome
by
an
architect
named
blavignac
a
smaller
work
entitled
on
the
symbolism
of
by
a
parish
priest
of
poitiers
a
by
the
abbé
baraud
then
a
whole
series
of
brochures
with
covers
of
grey
paper
bearing
no
titles
it
no
collection
at
all
said
carhaix
with
a
sigh
the
best
ones
are
wanting
the
campanis
of
angelo
rocca
and
the
of
percichellius
but
they
are
so
hard
to
find
and
so
expensive
when
you
do
find
them
a
glance
sufficed
for
the
rest
of
the
books
most
of
them
being
pious
works
latin
and
french
bibles
an
of
in
five
volumes
the
abbé
aubert
and
theory
of
religious
pluquet
of
and
several
lives
of
saints
ah
monsieur
my
own
books
are
not
much
account
but
des
hermies
lends
me
what
he
knows
will
interest
me
do
talk
so
much
said
his
wife
give
monsieur
a
chance
to
sit
down
and
she
handed
durtal
a
brimming
glass
aromatic
with
the
acidulous
perfume
of
genuine
cider
in
response
to
his
compliments
she
told
him
that
the
cider
came
from
brittany
and
was
made
by
relatives
of
hers
at
landévennec
her
and
carhaix
native
village
she
was
delighted
when
durtal
affirmed
that
long
ago
he
had
spent
a
day
in
landévennec
why
then
we
know
each
other
already
she
said
shaking
hands
with
him
again
the
room
was
heated
to
suffocation
by
a
stove
whose
pipe
zigzagged
over
to
the
window
and
out
through
a
square
nailed
to
the
sash
in
place
of
one
of
the
panes
carhaix
and
his
good
wife
with
her
honest
weak
face
and
frank
kind
eyes
were
the
most
restful
of
people
durtal
made
drowsy
by
the
warmth
and
the
quiet
domesticity
let
his
thoughts
wander
he
said
to
himself
if
i
had
a
place
like
this
above
the
roofs
of
paris
i
would
fix
it
up
and
make
of
it
a
real
haven
of
refuge
here
in
the
clouds
alone
and
aloof
i
would
work
away
on
my
book
and
take
my
time
about
it
years
perhaps
what
inconceivable
happiness
it
would
be
to
escape
from
the
age
and
while
the
waves
of
human
folly
were
breaking
against
the
foot
of
the
tower
to
sit
up
here
out
of
it
all
and
pore
over
antique
tomes
by
the
shaded
light
of
the
lamp
he
smiled
at
the
naïveté
of
his
daydream
i
certainly
do
like
your
place
he
said
aloud
as
if
to
sum
up
his
reflections
oh
you
would
if
you
had
to
live
here
said
the
good
wife
we
have
plenty
of
room
too
much
room
because
there
are
a
couple
of
bedchambers
as
big
as
this
besides
plenty
of
closet
space
but
it
so
inconvenient
and
so
cold
and
no
kitchen
and
she
pointed
to
a
landing
where
blocking
the
stairway
the
cook
stove
had
had
to
be
installed
and
there
are
so
many
many
steps
to
go
up
when
you
come
back
from
market
i
am
getting
old
and
i
have
a
twinge
of
the
rheumatics
whenever
i
think
about
making
the
climb
you
ca
even
drive
a
nail
into
this
rock
wall
and
have
a
peg
to
hang
things
on
said
carhaix
but
i
like
this
place
i
was
made
for
it
now
my
wife
dreams
constantly
of
spending
her
last
days
in
landévennec
des
hermies
rose
all
shook
hands
and
monsieur
and
madame
made
durtal
swear
that
he
would
come
again
what
refreshing
people
exclaimed
durtal
as
he
and
des
hermies
crossed
the
square
and
carhaix
is
a
mine
of
information
but
tell
me
what
the
devil
is
an
educated
man
of
no
ordinary
intelligence
doing
working
as
a
as
a
day
labourer
if
carhaix
could
hear
you
but
my
friend
in
the
middle
ages
were
high
officials
true
the
craft
has
declined
considerably
in
modern
times
i
could
tell
you
myself
how
carhaix
became
hipped
on
the
subject
of
bells
all
i
know
is
that
he
studied
at
a
seminary
in
brittany
that
he
had
scruples
of
conscience
and
considered
himself
unworthy
to
enter
the
priesthood
that
he
came
to
paris
and
apprenticed
himself
to
a
very
intellectual
master
père
gilbert
who
had
in
his
cell
at
notre
dame
some
ancient
and
of
course
unique
plans
of
paris
that
would
make
your
mouth
water
gilbert
was
a
either
he
was
an
enthusiastic
collector
of
documents
relating
to
old
paris
from
notre
dame
carhaix
came
to
saint
sulpice
fifteen
years
ago
and
has
been
there
ever
since
how
did
you
happen
to
make
his
acquaintance
first
he
was
my
patient
then
my
friend
i
known
him
ten
years
funny
he
does
look
like
a
seminary
product
most
of
them
have
the
shuffling
gait
and
sheepish
air
of
an
old
gardener
carhaix
will
be
all
right
for
a
few
more
years
said
des
hermies
as
if
to
himself
and
then
let
us
mercifully
wish
him
a
speedy
death
the
church
which
has
begun
by
sanctioning
the
introduction
of
gas
into
the
chapels
will
end
by
installing
mechanical
chimes
instead
of
bells
that
will
be
charming
the
machinery
will
be
run
by
electricity
and
we
shall
have
real
timbreless
protestant
peals
then
carhaix
wife
will
have
a
chance
to
go
back
to
finistère
no
they
are
too
poor
and
then
too
carhaix
would
be
if
he
lost
his
bells
curious
a
man
affection
for
the
object
that
he
manipulates
the
mechanic
love
for
his
machine
the
thing
that
one
tends
and
that
obeys
one
becomes
personalized
and
one
ends
by
falling
in
love
with
it
and
the
bell
is
an
instrument
in
a
class
of
its
own
it
is
baptized
like
a
christian
anointed
with
sacramental
oil
and
according
to
the
pontifical
rubric
it
is
also
to
be
sanctified
in
the
interior
of
its
chalice
by
a
bishop
in
seven
cruciform
unctions
with
the
oil
of
the
infirm
that
it
may
send
to
the
dying
the
message
which
shall
sustain
them
in
their
last
agonies
it
is
the
herald
of
the
church
the
voice
from
without
as
the
priest
is
the
voice
from
within
so
you
see
it
is
a
mere
piece
of
bronze
a
reversed
mortar
to
be
swung
at
a
rope
end
add
that
bells
like
fine
wines
ripen
with
age
that
their
tone
becomes
more
ample
and
mellow
that
they
lose
their
sharp
bouquet
their
raw
flavour
that
will
explain
imperfectly
how
one
can
become
attached
to
them
why
you
seem
to
be
an
enthusiast
yourself
oh
i
do
know
anything
about
it
i
am
simply
repeating
what
i
have
heard
carhaix
say
if
the
subject
interests
you
he
will
be
only
too
glad
to
teach
you
the
symbolism
of
bells
he
is
inexhaustible
the
man
is
a
monomaniac
i
can
understand
said
durtal
dreamily
i
live
in
a
quarter
where
there
are
a
good
many
convents
and
at
dawn
the
air
is
with
the
vibrance
of
the
chimes
when
i
was
ill
i
used
to
lie
awake
at
night
awaiting
the
sound
of
the
matin
bells
and
welcoming
them
as
a
deliverance
in
the
grey
light
i
felt
that
i
was
being
cuddled
by
a
distant
and
secret
caress
that
a
lullaby
was
crooned
over
me
and
a
cool
hand
applied
to
my
burning
forehead
i
had
the
assurance
that
the
folk
who
were
awake
were
praying
for
the
others
and
consequently
for
me
i
felt
less
lonely
i
really
believe
the
bells
are
sounded
for
the
special
benefit
of
the
sick
who
can
not
sleep
the
bells
ring
for
others
notably
for
the
the
rather
common
inscription
for
the
side
of
a
bell
pacify
the
is
singularly
apt
when
you
think
it
over
this
conversation
was
still
haunting
durtal
when
he
went
to
bed
carhaix
phrase
the
ring
of
the
bells
is
the
real
sacred
music
took
hold
of
him
like
an
obsession
and
drifting
back
through
the
centuries
he
saw
in
dream
the
slow
processional
of
monks
and
the
kneeling
congregations
responding
to
the
call
of
the
angelus
and
drinking
in
the
balm
of
holy
sound
as
if
it
were
consecrated
wine
all
the
details
he
had
ever
known
of
the
liturgies
of
ages
came
crowding
into
his
mind
he
could
hear
the
sounding
of
matin
invitatories
chimes
telling
a
rosary
of
harmony
over
tortuous
labyrinths
of
narrow
streets
over
cornet
towers
over
pignons
over
dentelated
walls
the
chimes
chanting
the
canonical
hours
prime
and
tierce
sexte
and
none
vespers
and
compline
celebrating
the
joy
of
a
city
with
the
tinkling
laughter
of
the
little
bells
tolling
its
sorrow
with
the
ponderous
lamentation
of
the
great
ones
and
there
were
master
ringers
in
those
times
makers
of
chords
who
could
send
into
the
air
the
expression
of
the
whole
soul
of
a
community
and
the
bells
which
they
served
as
submissive
sons
and
faithful
deacons
were
as
humble
and
as
truly
of
the
people
as
was
the
church
itself
as
the
priest
at
certain
times
put
off
his
chasuble
so
the
bell
at
times
had
put
off
its
sacred
character
and
spoken
to
the
baptized
on
fair
day
and
market
day
inviting
them
in
the
event
of
rain
to
settle
their
affairs
inside
the
nave
of
the
church
and
that
the
sanctity
of
the
place
might
not
be
violated
by
the
conflicts
arising
from
sharp
bargaining
imposing
upon
them
a
probity
unknown
before
or
since
today
bells
spoke
an
obsolete
language
incomprehensible
to
man
carhaix
was
under
no
misapprehension
living
in
an
aërial
tomb
outside
the
human
scramble
he
was
faithful
to
his
art
and
in
consequence
no
longer
had
any
reason
for
existing
he
vegetated
superfluous
and
demoded
in
a
society
which
insisted
that
for
its
amusement
the
holy
place
be
turned
into
a
concert
hall
he
was
like
a
creature
reverted
a
relic
of
a
bygone
age
and
he
was
supremely
contemptuous
of
the
miserable
de
church
showmen
who
to
draw
fashionable
audiences
did
not
fear
to
offer
the
attraction
of
cavatinas
and
waltzes
rendered
on
the
cathedral
organ
by
manufacturers
of
profane
music
by
ballet
mongers
and
comic

he
blew
out
the
candle

who
loves
this
epoch
about
as
well
as
des
hermies
and
i
do
but
he
has
the
tutelage
of
his
bells
and
certainly
among
his
wards
he
has
his
favourite
he
is
not
to
be
pitied
he
has
his
hobby
which
renders
life
possible

him

chapter
iv
how
is
gilles
de
rais
progressing
i
have
finished
the
first
part
of
his
life
making
just
the
briefest
possible
mention
of
his
virtues
and
achievements
which
are
of
no
interest
remarked
des
hermies
evidently
since
the
name
of
gilles
de
rais
would
have
perished
four
centuries
ago
but
for
the
enormities
of
vice
which
it
symbolizes
i
am
coming
to
the
crimes
now
the
great
difficulty
you
see
is
to
explain
how
this
man
who
was
a
brave
captain
and
a
good
christian
all
of
a
sudden
became
a
sacrilegious
sadist
and
a
coward
metamorphosed
over
night
as
it
were
worse
as
if
at
a
touch
of
a
fairy
wand
or
of
a
playwright
pen
that
is
what
mystifies
his
biographers
of
course
untraceable
influences
must
have
been
at
work
a
long
time
and
there
must
have
been
occasional
outcropping
not
mentioned
in
the
chronicles
here
is
a
recapitulation
of
our
material
gilles
de
rais
was
born
about
on
the
boundary
between
brittany
and
anjou
in
the
château
de
mâchecoul
we
know
nothing
of
his
childhood
his
father
died
about
the
end
of
october
and
his
mother
almost
immediately
married
a
sieur
abandoning
her
two
sons
gilles
and
rené
they
became
the
wards
of
their
grandfather
jean
de
craon
man
old
and
ancient
and
of
exceeding
great
age
as
the
texts
say
he
seems
to
have
allowed
his
two
charges
to
run
wild
and
then
to
have
got
rid
of
gilles
by
marrying
him
to
catherine
de
thouars
november
gilles
is
known
to
have
been
at
the
court
of
the
dauphin
five
years
later
his
contemporaries
represent
him
as
a
robust
active
man
of
striking
beauty
and
rare
elegance
we
have
no
explicit
statement
as
to
the
rôle
he
played
in
this
court
but
one
can
easily
imagine
what
sort
of
treatment
the
richest
baron
in
france
received
at
the
hands
of
an
impoverished
king
for
at
that
moment
charles
vii
was
in
extremities
he
was
without
money
prestige
or
real
authority
even
the
cities
along
the
loire
scarcely
obeyed
him
france
decimated
a
few
years
before
by
the
plague
and
further
depopulated
by
massacres
was
in
a
deplorable
situation
england
rising
from
the
sea
like
the
fabled
polyp
the
kraken
had
cast
her
tentacles
over
brittany
normandy
de
france
part
of
picardy
the
entire
north
the
interior
as
far
as
orléans
and
crawling
forward
left
in
her
wake
towns
squeezed
dry
and
country
exhausted
in
vain
charles
clamoured
for
subsidies
invented
excuses
for
exactions
and
pressed
the
imposts
the
paralyzed
cities
and
fields
abandoned
to
the
wolves
could
afford
no
succour
remember
his
very
claim
to
the
throne
was
disputed
he
became
like
a
blind
man
going
the
rounds
with
a
tin
cup
begging
sous
his
court
at
chinon
was
a
snarl
of
intrigue
complicated
by
an
occasional
murder
weary
of
being
hunted
more
or
less
out
of
harm
way
behind
the
loire
charles
and
his
partisans
finally
consoled
themselves
by
flaunting
in
the
face
of
inevitable
disaster
the
debaucheries
of
the
condemned
making
the
most
of
the
few
moments
left
them
forays
and
loans
furnished
them
with
opulent
cheer
and
permitted
them
to
carouse
on
a
grand
scale
the
eternal
and
the
misfortunes
of
war
were
forgotten
in
the
arms
of
courtesans
what
more
could
have
been
expected
of
a
king
the
issue
of
an
infamous
mother
and
a
mad
father
oh
whatever
you
say
about
charles
vii
pales
beside
the
testimony
of
the
portrait
of
him
in
the
louvre
painted
by
foucquet
that
bestial
face
with
the
eyes
of
a
ursurer
and
the
sly
mouth
that
butter
would
melt
in
has
often
arrested
me
foucquet
depicts
a
debauched
priest
who
has
a
bad
cold
and
has
been
drinking
sour
wine
yet
you
can
see
that
this
monarch
is
of
the
very
same
type
as
the
more
refined
less
salacious
more
prudently
cruel
more
obstinate
and
cunning
louis
xi
his
son
and
successor
well
charles
vii
was
the
man
who
had
jean
sans
peur
assassinated
and
who
abandoned
jeanne
what
more
need
be
said
what
indeed
well
gilles
de
rais
who
had
raised
an
army
at
his
own
expense
was
certainly
welcomed
by
this
court
with
open
arms
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
footed
the
bills
for
tournaments
and
banquets
that
he
was
vigilantly
by
the
courtiers
and
that
he
lent
the
king
staggering
sums
but
in
spite
of
his
popularity
he
never
seems
to
have
evaded
responsibility
and
wallowed
in
debauchery
like
the
king
we
find
gilles
shortly
afterward
defending
anjou
and
maine
against
the
english
the
chronicles
say
that
he
was
good
and
hardy
captain
but
his
and
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
borne
back
by
force
of
numbers
the
english
armies
uniting
inundated
the
country
and
pushing
on
unchecked
invaded
the
interior
the
king
was
ready
to
flee
to
the
mediterranean
provinces
and
let
france
go
when
jeanne
appeared
gilles
returned
to
court
and
was
entrusted
by
charles
with
the
and
defence
of
the
maid
of
orleans
he
followed
her
everywhere
fought
at
her
side
even
under
the
walls
of
paris
and
was
with
her
at
rheims
the
day
of
the
coronation
at
which
time
says
monstrelet
the
king
rewarded
his
valour
by
naming
him
marshal
of
france
at
the
age
of
lord
des
hermies
interrupted
promotion
came
rapidly
in
those
times
but
i
suppose
warriors
then
were
the
bemedalled
incompetents
they
are
now
oh
do
be
misled
the
title
of
marshal
of
france
did
mean
so
much
in
gilles
time
as
it
did
afterward
in
the
reign
of
francis
i
and
nothing
like
what
it
has
come
to
mean
since
napoleon
what
was
the
conduct
of
gilles
de
rais
toward
jeanne
we
have
no
certain
knowledge
vallet
de
viriville
without
proof
accuses
him
of
treachery
bossard
on
the
contrary
claims
and
alleges
plausible
reasons
for
entertaining
the
opinion
that
he
was
loyal
to
her
and
watched
over
her
devotedly
what
is
certain
is
that
gilles
soul
became
saturated
with
mystical
ideas
his
whole
history
proves
it
he
was
constantly
in
association
with
this
extraordinary
maid
whose
adventures
seemed
to
attest
the
possibility
of
divine
intervention
in
earthly
affairs
he
witnessed
the
miracle
of
a
peasant
girl
dominating
a
court
of
ruffians
and
bandits
and
arousing
a
cowardly
king
who
was
on
the
point
of
flight
he
witnessed
the
incredible
episode
of
a
virgin
bringing
back
to
the
fold
such
black
rams
as
la
hire
xaintrailles
beaumanoir
chabannes
dunois
and
gaucourt
and
washing
their
old
fleeces
whiter
than
snow
undoubtedly
gilles
also
under
her
shepherding
docilely
cropped
the
white
grass
of
the
gospel
took
communion
the
morning
of
a
battle
and
revered
jeanne
as
a
saint
he
saw
the
maid
fulfil
all
her
promises
she
raised
the
siege
of
orléans
had
the
king
consecrated
at
rheims
and
then
declared
that
her
mission
was
accomplished
and
asked
as
a
boon
that
she
be
permitted
to
return
home
now
i
should
say
that
as
a
result
of
such
an
association
mysticism
began
to
soar
henceforth
we
have
to
deal
with
a
man
who
is
moreover
pardon
the
interruption
but
i
am
not
so
sure
that
jeanne
intervention
was
a
good
thing
for
france
why
not
i
will
explain
you
know
that
the
defenders
of
charles
were
for
the
most
part
mediterranean
ferocious
pillagers
execrated
by
the
very
people
they
came
to
protect
the
hundred
years
war
in
effect
was
a
war
of
the
south
against
the
north
england
at
that
epoch
had
not
got
over
the
conquest
and
was
norman
in
blood
language
and
tradition
suppose
jeanne
had
stayed
with
her
mother
and
stuck
to
her
knitting
charles
vii
would
have
been
dispossessed
and
the
war
would
have
come
to
an
end
the
plantagenets
would
have
reigned
over
england
and
france
which
in
primeval
times
before
the
channel
existed
formed
one
territory
occupied
by
one
race
as
you
know
thus
there
would
have
been
a
single
united
and
powerful
kingdom
of
the
north
reaching
as
far
as
the
province
of
languedoc
and
embracing
peoples
whose
tastes
instincts
and
customs
were
alike
on
the
other
hand
the
coronation
of
a
valois
at
rheims
created
a
heterogeneous
and
preposterous
france
separating
homogeneous
elements
uniting
the
most
incompatible
nationalities
races
the
most
hostile
to
each
other
and
identifying
us
inseparably
alas
with
those
munchers
of
chocolate
and
raveners
of
garlic
who
are
not
frenchmen
at
all
but
spaniards
and
italians
in
a
word
if
it
had
been
for
jeanne
france
would
not
now
belong
to
that
line
of
histrionic
forensic
perfidious
chatterboxes
the
precious
latin
race
devil
take
it
durtal
raised
his
eyebrows
my
my
he
said
laughing
your
remarks
prove
to
me
that
you
are
interested
in
own
our
native
land
i
should
never
have
suspected
it
of
you
of
course
you
would
said
des
hermies
relighting
his
cigarette
as
has
so
often
been
said
own
my
native
land
is
wherever
i
happen
to
feel
at
home
now
i
do
feel
at
home
except
with
the
people
of
the
north
but
i
interrupted
you
let
get
back
to
the
subject
what
were
you
saying
i
forget
oh
yes
i
was
saying
that
the
maid
had
completed
her
task
now
we
are
confronted
by
a
question
to
which
there
is
seemingly
no
answer
what
did
gilles
do
when
she
was
captured
how
did
he
feel
about
her
death
we
can
not
tell
we
know
that
he
was
lurking
in
the
vicinity
of
rouen
at
the
time
of
the
trial
but
it
is
too
much
to
conclude
from
that
like
certain
of
his
biographies
that
he
was
plotting
her
rescue
at
any
rate
after
losing
track
of
him
completely
we
find
that
he
has
shut
himself
in
at
his
castle
of
tiffauges
he
is
no
longer
the
rough
soldier
the
uncouth
at
the
time
when
the
misdeeds
are
about
to
begin
the
artist
and
man
of
letters
develop
in
gilles
and
taking
complete
possession
of
him
incite
him
under
the
impulsion
of
a
perverted
mysticism
to
the
most
sophisticated
of
cruelties
the
most
delicate
of
crimes
for
he
was
almost
alone
in
his
time
this
baron
de
rais
in
an
age
when
his
peers
were
simple
brutes
he
sought
the
delicate
delirium
of
art
dreamed
of
a
literature
and
profound
he
even
composed
a
treatise
on
the
art
of
evoking
demons
he
gloried
in
the
music
of
the
church
and
would
have
nothing
about
his
that
was
not
rare
and
difficult
to
obtain
he
was
an
erudite
latinist
a
brilliant
conversationalist
a
sure
and
generous
friend
he
possessed
a
library
extraordinary
for
an
epoch
when
nothing
was
read
but
theology
and
lives
of
saints
we
have
the
description
of
several
of
his
manuscripts
suetonius
valerius
maximus
and
an
ovid
on
parchment
bound
in
red
leather
with
vermeil
clasp
and
key
these
books
were
his
passion
he
carried
them
with
him
when
he
travelled
he
had
attached
to
his
household
a
painter
named
thomas
who
illuminated
them
with
ornate
letters
and
miniatures
and
gilles
himself
painted
the
enamels
which
a
specialist
discovered
after
an
assiduous
search
set
in
the
bindings
gilles
taste
in
furnishings
was
elevated
and
bizarre
he
revelled
in
abbatial
stuffs
voluptuous
silks
in
the
sombre
gilding
of
old
brocade
he
liked
knowingly
spiced
foods
ardent
wines
heavy
with
aromatics
he
dreamed
of
unknown
gems
weird
stones
uncanny
metals
he
was
the
des
esseintes
of
the
fifteenth
century
all
this
was
very
expensive
less
so
perhaps
than
the
luxurious
court
which
made
tiffauges
a
place
like
none
other
he
had
a
guard
of
two
hundred
men
knights
captains
squires
pages
and
all
these
people
had
personal
attendants
who
were
magnificently
equipped
at
gilles
expense
the
luxury
of
his
chapel
and
collegium
was
madly
extravagant
there
was
in
residence
at
tiffauges
a
complete
metropolitan
clergy
deans
vicars
treasurers
canons
clerks
deacons
scholasters
and
choir
boys
there
is
an
inventory
extant
of
the
surplices
stoles
and
amices
and
the
fur
choir
hats
with
crowns
of
squirrel
and
linings
of
vair
there
are
countless
sacerdotal
ornaments
we
find
vermilion
altar
cloths
curtains
of
emerald
silk
a
cope
of
velvet
crimson
and
violet
with
orpheys
of
cloth
of
gold
another
of
rose
damask
satin
dalmatics
for
the
deacons
baldachins
figured
with
hawks
and
falcons
of
cyprus
gold
we
find
plate
hammered
chalices
and
ciboria
crusted
with
uncut
jewels
there
are
reliquaries
among
them
a
silver
head
of
saint
honoré
a
mass
of
sparkling
jewelleries
which
an
artist
installed
in
the
château
cuts
to
order
and
anyone
who
came
along
was
welcome
from
all
corners
of
france
caravans
journeyed
toward
this
château
where
the
artist
the
poet
the
scholar
found
princely
hospitality
cordial
goodfellowship
gifts
of
welcome
and
largesse
at
departure
already
undermined
by
the
demands
which
the
war
had
made
on
it
his
fortune
was
giving
way
beneath
these
expenditures
now
he
began
to
walk
the
terrible
ways
of
usury
he
borrowed
of
the
most
unscrupulous
bourgeois
hypothecated
his
châteaux
alienated
his
lands
at
times
he
was
reduced
to
asking
advances
on
his
religious
ornaments
on
his
jewels
on
his
books
i
am
glad
to
see
that
the
method
of
ruining
oneself
in
the
middle
ages
did
not
differ
sensibly
from
that
of
our
days
said
des
hermies
however
our
ancestors
did
not
have
monte
carlo
the
notaries
and
the
bourse
and
have
sorcery
and
alchemy
a
memorial
addressed
to
the
king
by
the
heirs
of
gilles
de
rais
informs
us
that
this
immense
fortune
was
squandered
in
less
than
eight
years
now
it
the
signories
of
confolens
chabanes
châteaumorant
lombert
ceded
to
a
captain
for
a
ridiculous
price
now
it
the
fief
of
fontaine
milon
of
angers
the
fortress
of
saint
etienne
de
mer
morte
acquired
by
guillaume
le
ferron
for
a
song
again
it
the
châteaux
of
blaison
and
of
chemille
forfeited
to
guillaume
de
la
jumelière
who
never
has
to
pay
a
sou
but
look
there
a
long
list
of
castellanies
and
forests
salt
mines
and
farm
lands
said
durtal
spreading
out
a
great
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
had
copied
the
account
of
the
purchases
and
sales
frightened
by
his
mad
course
the
family
of
the
marshal
supplicated
the
king
to
intervene
and
charles
vii
as
he
said
the
malgovernance
of
the
sire
de
rais
forbade
him
in
grand
council
by
letters
dated
to
sell
or
make
over
any
fortress
any
château
any
land
this
order
simply
hastened
the
ruin
of
the
interdicted
the
grand
skinflint
the
master
usurer
of
the
time
jean
v
duke
of
brittany
refused
to
publish
the
edict
in
his
states
but
underhandedly
notified
all
those
of
his
subjects
who
dealt
with
gilles
no
one
now
dared
to
buy
the
marshal
domains
for
fear
of
incurring
the
wrath
of
the
king
so
jean
v
remained
the
sole
purchaser
and
fixed
the
prices
you
may
judge
how
liberal
his
prices
were
that
explains
gilles
hatred
of
his
family
who
had
solicited
these
letters
patent
of
the
king
and
why
as
long
as
he
lived
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
wife
nor
with
his
daughter
whom
he
consigned
to
a
dungeon
at
pouzauges
now
to
return
to
the
question
which
i
put
a
while
ago
how
and
with
what
motives
gilles
quitted
the
court
i
think
the
facts
which
i
have
outlined
will
partially
explain
it
is
evident
that
for
quite
a
while
long
before
the
marshal
retired
to
his
estates
charles
had
been
assailed
by
the
complaints
of
wife
and
other
relatives
moreover
the
courtiers
must
have
execrated
the
young
man
on
account
of
his
riches
and
luxuries
and
the
king
the
same
king
who
abandoned
jeanne
when
he
considered
that
she
could
no
longer
be
useful
to
him
found
an
occasion
to
avenge
himself
on
gilles
for
the
favours
gilles
had
done
him
when
the
king
needed
money
to
finance
his
debaucheries
or
to
raise
troops
he
had
not
considered
the
marshal
lavish
now
that
the
marshal
was
ruined
the
king
censured
him
for
his
prodigality
held
him
at
arm
length
and
spared
him
no
reproach
and
no
menace
we
may
be
sure
gilles
had
no
reason
to
regret
leaving
this
court
and
another
thing
is
to
be
taken
into
consideration
he
was
doubtless
sick
and
tired
of
the
nomadic
existence
of
a
soldier
he
was
doubtless
impatient
to
get
back
to
a
pacific
atmosphere
among
books
moreover
he
seems
to
have
been
completely
dominated
by
the
passion
for
alchemy
for
which
he
was
ready
to
abandon
all
else
for
it
is
worth
noting
that
this
science
which
threw
him
into
demonomania
when
he
hoped
to
stave
off
inevitable
ruin
with
it
he
had
loved
for
its
own
sake
when
he
was
rich
it
was
in
fact
toward
the
year
when
his
coffers
bulged
with
gold
that
he
attempted
the
work
for
the
first
time
we
shall
find
him
then
bent
over
his
retorts
in
the
château
de
tiffauges
that
is
the
point
to
which
i
have
brought
my
history
and
now
i
am
about
to
begin
on
the
series
of
crimes
of
magic
and
sadism
but
all
this
said
des
hermies
does
not
explain
how
from
a
man
of
piety
he
was
suddenly
changed
into
a
satanist
from
a
placid
scholar
into
a
violator
of
little
children
a
of
boys
and
girls
i
have
already
told
you
that
there
are
no
documents
to
bind
together
the
two
parts
of
this
life
so
strangely
divided
but
in
what
i
have
been
narrating
you
can
pick
out
some
of
the
threads
of
the
duality
to
be
precise
this
man
as
i
have
just
had
you
observe
was
a
true
mystic
he
witnessed
the
most
extraordinary
events
which
history
has
ever
shown
association
with
jeanne
certainly
stimulated
his
desires
for
the
divine
now
from
lofty
mysticism
to
base
satanism
there
is
but
one
step
in
the
beyond
all
things
touch
he
carried
his
zeal
for
prayer
into
the
territory
of
blasphemy
he
was
guided
and
controlled
by
that
troop
of
sacrilegious
priests
transmuters
of
metals
and
evokers
of
demons
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
at
tiffauges
you
think
then
that
the
maid
of
orleans
was
really
responsible
for
his
career
of
evil
to
a
certain
point
consider
she
roused
an
impetuous
soul
ready
for
anything
as
well
for
orgies
of
saintliness
as
for
ecstasies
of
crime
there
was
no
transition
between
the
two
phases
of
his
being
the
moment
jeanne
was
dead
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
sorcerers
who
were
the
most
learned
of
scoundrels
and
the
most
unscrupulous
of
scholars
these
men
who
frequented
the
château
de
tiffauges
were
fervent
latinists
marvellous
conversationalists
possessors
of
forgotten
arcana
guardians
of
secrets
gilles
was
evidently
more
fitted
to
live
with
them
than
with
men
like
dunois
and
la
hire
these
magicians
whom
all
the
biographers
agree
to
represent
wrongly
i
think
as
vulgar
parasites
and
base
knaves
were
as
i
view
them
the
patricians
of
intellect
of
the
fifteenth
century
not
having
found
places
in
the
church
where
they
would
certainly
have
accepted
no
position
beneath
that
of
cardinal
or
pope
they
could
in
those
troubled
times
of
ignorance
but
take
refuge
in
the
patronage
of
a
great
lord
like
gilles
and
gilles
was
indeed
the
only
one
at
that
epoch
who
was
intelligent
enough
and
educated
enough
to
understand
them
to
sum
up
natural
mysticism
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
daily
association
with
savants
obsessed
by
satanism
the
sword
of
damocles
hanging
over
his
head
to
be
conjured
away
by
the
will
of
the
devil
perhaps
an
ardent
a
mad
curiosity
concerning
the
forbidden
sciences
all
this
explains
why
little
by
little
as
the
bonds
uniting
him
to
the
world
of
alchemists
and
sorcerers
grow
stronger
he
throws
himself
into
the
occult
and
is
swept
on
by
it
into
the
most
unthinkable
crimes
then
as
to
being
a
of
children
and
he
did
immediately
become
one
no
gilles
did
not
violate
and
trucidate
little
boys
until
after
he
became
convinced
of
the
vanity
of
alchemy
why
he
does
not
differ
greatly
from
the
other
barons
of
his
times
he
exceeds
them
in
the
magnitude
of
his
debauches
in
opulence
of
murders
and
that
all
it
a
fact
read
michelet
you
will
see
that
the
princes
of
this
epoch
were
redoubtable
butchers
there
was
a
sire
de
giac
who
poisoned
his
wife
put
her
astride
of
his
horse
and
rode
at
breakneck
speed
for
five
leagues
until
she
died
there
was
another
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
who
collared
his
father
dragged
him
barefoot
through
the
snow
and
calmly
thrust
him
into
a
subterranean
prison
and
left
him
there
until
he
died
and
how
many
others
i
have
tried
without
success
to
find
whether
in
battles
and
forays
the
marshal
committed
any
serious
misdeeds
i
have
discovered
nothing
except
that
he
had
a
pronounced
taste
for
the
gibbet
for
he
liked
to
string
up
all
the
renegade
french
whom
he
surprised
in
the
ranks
of
the
english
or
in
the
cities
which
were
not
very
much
devoted
to
the
king
we
shall
find
his
taste
for
this
kind
of
torture
manifesting
itself
later
on
in
the
château
de
tiffauges
now
in
conclusion
add
to
all
these
factors
a
formidable
pride
a
pride
which
incites
him
to
say
during
his
trial
potent
was
the
star
under
which
i
was
born
that
i
have
done
what
no
one
in
the
world
has
done
nor
ever
can
do
and
assuredly
the
marquis
de
sade
is
only
a
timid
bourgeois
a
mediocre
fantasist
beside
him
since
it
is
difficult
to
be
a
saint
said
des
hermies
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
be
a
satanist
one
of
the
two
extremes
of
impotence
hatred
of
the
mediocre
that
perhaps
is
one
of
the
more
indulgent
definitions
of
diabolism
perhaps
one
can
take
pride
in
going
as
far
in
crime
as
a
saint
in
virtue
and
that
expresses
gilles
de
rais
exactly
all
the
same
it
a
mean
subject
to
handle
it
certainly
is
but
happily
the
documents
are
abundant
satan
was
terrible
to
the
middle
ages
and
to
the
modern
what
do
you
mean
that
satanism
has
come
down
in
a
straight
unbroken
line
from
that
age
to
this
oh
no
you
do
believe
that
at
this
very
hour
the
devil
is
being
evoked
and
the
black
mass
celebrated
yes
you
are
sure
perfectly
you
amaze
me
but
man
do
you
know
that
to
witness
such
things
would
aid
me
signally
in
my
work
no
joking
you
believe
in
a
contemporary
satanistic
manifestation
you
have
proofs
yes
and
of
them
we
shall
speak
later
for
today
i
am
very
busy
tomorrow
evening
when
we
dine
with
carhaix
do
forget
i
come
by
for
you
meanwhile
think
over
the
phrase
which
you
applied
a
moment
ago
to
the
magicians
they
had
entered
the
church
they
would
not
have
consented
to
be
anything
but
cardinals
and
popes
and
then
just
think
what
kind
of
a
clergy
we
have
nowadays
the
explanation
of
satanism
is
there
in
great
part
anyway
for
without
sacrilegious
priests
there
is
no
mature
satanism
but
what
do
these
priests
want
everything
exclaimed
des
hermies
hmmm
like
gilles
de
rais
who
asked
the
demon
for
power
riches
all
that
humanity
covets
to
be
deeded
to
him
by
a
title
signed
with
his
own
blood
chapter
v
come
right
in
and
get
warm
ah
messieurs
you
must
not
do
that
any
more
said
mme
carhaix
seeing
durtal
draw
from
his
pocket
some
bottles
wrapped
in
paper
while
des
hermies
placed
on
the
table
some
little
packages
tied
with
twine
you
must
spend
your
money
on
us
oh
but
you
see
we
enjoy
doing
it
mme
carhaix
and
your
husband
he
is
in
the
tower
since
morning
he
has
been
going
from
one
tantrum
into
another
my
the
cold
is
terrible
today
said
durtal
and
i
should
think
it
would
be
no
fun
up
there
oh
he
is
grumbling
for
himself
but
for
his
bells
take
off
your
things
they
took
off
their
overcoats
and
came
up
close
to
the
stove
it
is
what
you
would
call
hot
in
here
said
mme
carhaix
but
to
thaw
this
place
you
would
have
to
keep
a
fire
going
night
and
day
why
do
you
get
a
portable
stove
oh
heavens
that
would
asphyxiate
us
it
would
be
very
comfortable
at
any
rate
said
des
hermies
for
there
is
no
chimney
you
might
get
some
joints
of
pipe
and
run
them
out
of
the
window
the
way
you
have
fixed
this
tubing
but
speaking
of
that
kind
of
apparatus
durtal
does
it
seem
to
you
that
those
hideous
galvanized
iron
contraptions
perfectly
typify
our
utilitarian
epoch
just
think
the
engineer
offended
by
any
object
that
has
a
sinister
or
ignoble
form
reveals
himself
entire
in
this
invention
he
tells
us
want
heat
you
shall
have
heat
and
nothing
else
anything
agreeable
to
the
eye
is
out
of
the
question
no
more
snapping
crackling
wood
fire
no
more
gentle
pervasive
warmth
the
useful
without
the
fantastic
ah
the
beautiful
jets
of
flame
darting
out
from
a
red
cave
of
coals
and
spurting
up
over
a
roaring
log
but
there
are
lots
of
stoves
where
you
can
see
the
fire
objected
madame
yes
and
then
it
worse
yet
fire
behind
a
grated
window
of
mica
flame
in
prison
depressing
ah
those
fine
fires
of
faggots
and
dry
vine
stocks
out
in
the
country
they
smell
good
and
they
cast
a
golden
glow
over
everything
modern
life
has

refused

no

dinner
is
ready
mighty
appetizing
said
durtal
inhaling
the
odour
of
a
peppery
perfumed
with
a
symphony
of
vegetables
of
which
the
keynote
was
celery
everybody
sit
down
said
carhaix
reappearing
with
a
clean
blouse
on
his
face
shining
of
soap
and
water
they
sat
down
the
glowing
stove
purred
durtal
felt
the
sudden
relaxation
of
a
chilly
soul
dipped
into
a
warm
bath
at
carhaix
one
was
so
far
from
paris
so
remote
from
the
epoch
the
lodge
was
poor
but
cosy
comfortable
cordial
the
very
table
set
country
style
the
polished
glasses
the
covered
dish
of
sweet
butter
the
cider
pitcher
the
somewhat
battered
lamp
casting
reflections
of
tarnished
silver
on
the
great
cloth
contributed
to
the
atmosphere
of
home
next
time
i
come
i
must
stop
at
the
english
store
and
buy
a
jar
of
that
reliable
orange
marmalade
said
durtal
to
himself
for
by
common
consent
with
des
hermies
he
never
dined
with
the
without
furnishing
a
share
of
the
provisions
carhaix
set
out
a
and
a
simple
salad
and
poured
his
cider
not
to
be
an
expense
to
him
des
hermies
and
durtal
brought
wine
coffee
liquor
desserts
and
managed
so
that
their
contributions
would
pay
for
the
soup
and
the
beef
which
would
have
lasted
for
several
days
if
the
carhaixes
had
eaten
alone
this
time
i
did
it
said
mme
carhaix
triumphantly
serving
to
each
in
turn
a
bouillon
whose
iridescent
surface
was
looped
with
rings
of
topaz
it
was
succulent
and
unctuous
robust
and
yet
delicate
flavoured
as
it
was
with
the
broth
of
a
whole
flock
of
boiled
chickens
the
diners
were
silent
now
their
noses
in
their
plates
their
faces
brightened
by
steam
from
the
savoury
soup
soup
two
selected
dishes
a
salad
and
a
dessert
now
is
the
time
to
repeat
the
chestnut
dear
to
flaubert
dine
like
this
in
a
restaurant
said
durtal
let
not
malign
the
restaurants
said
des
hermies
they
afford
a
very
special
delight
to
the
person
who
has
the
instinct
of
the
inspector
i
had
an
opportunity
to
gratify
this
instinct
just
the
other
night
i
was
returning
from
a
call
on
a
patient
and
i
dropped
into
one
of
these
establishments
where
for
the
sum
of
three
francs
you
are
entitled
to
soup
two
selected
dishes
a
salad
and
a
dessert
the
restaurant
where
i
go
as
often
as
once
a
month
has
an
unvarying
clientele
hostile
highbrows
officers
in
mufti
members
of
parliament
bureaucrats
while
laboriously
gnawing
my
way
through
a
redoubtable
sole
with
sauce
au
gratin
i
examined
the
habitués
seated
all
around
me
and
i
found
them
singularly
altered
since
my
last
visit
they
had
become
bony
or
bloated
their
eyes
were
either
hollow
with
violet
rings
around
them
or
puffy
with
crimson
pouches
beneath
the
fat
people
had
become
yellow
and
the
thin
ones
were
turning
green
more
deadly
than
the
forgotten
venefices
of
the
days
of
the
avignon
papacy
the
terrible
preparations
served
in
this
place
were
slowly
poisoning
its
customers
it
was
interested
as
you
may
believe
i
made
myself
the
subject
of
a
course
of
toxicological
research
and
studying
my
food
as
it
went
down
i
identified
the
frightful
ingredients
masking
the
mixtures
of
tannin
and
powdered
carbon
with
which
the
fish
was
embalmed
and
i
penetrated
the
disguise
of
the
marinated
meats
painted
with
sauces
the
colour
of
sewage
and
i
diagnosed
the
wine
as
being
coloured
with
fuscin
perfumed
with
furfurol
and
enforced
with
molasses
and
plaster
i
have
promised
myself
to
return
every
month
to
register
the
slow
but
sure
progress
of
these
people
toward
the
tomb
oh
cried
mme
carhaix
and
you
will
claim
said
durtal
that
you
are
satanic
see
carhaix
he
at
it
already
he
wo
even
give
us
time
to
get
our
breath
but
must
be
dogging
us
about
satanism
it
true
i
promised
him
i
try
and
get
you
to
tell
us
something
about
it
tonight
yes
continued
des
hermies
in
response
to
carhaix
look
of
astonishment
yesterday
durtal
who
is
engaged
as
you
know
in
writing
a
history
of
gilles
de
rais
declared
that
he
possessed
all
the
information
there
was
about
diabolism
in
the
middle
ages
i
asked
him
if
he
had
any
material
on
the
satanism
of
the
present
day
he
asked
me
what
i
was
talking
about
and
would
believe
that
these
practices
are
being
carried
on
right
now
but
they
are
replied
carhaix
becoming
grave
it
is
only
too
true
before
we
go
any
further
there
is
one
question
i
like
to
put
to
des
hermies
said
durtal
can
you
honestly
without
joking
without
letting
that
saturnine
smile
play
around
the
corner
of
your
mouth
tell
me
in
perfectly
good
faith
whether
you
do
or
do
not
believe
in
catholicism
he
exclaimed
the
why
he
worse
than
an
unbeliever
he
a
heresiarch
the
fast
is
if
i
were
certain
of
anything
i
would
be
inclined
toward
manicheism
said
des
hermies
it
one
of
the
oldest
and
it
is
simplest
of
religions
and
it
best
explains
the
abominable
mess
everything
is
in
at
the
present
time
the
principle
of
good
and
the
principle
of
evil
the
god
of
light
and
the
god
of
darkness
two
rivals
are
fighting
for
our
souls
that
at
least
clear
right
now
it
is
evident
that
the
evil
god
has
the
upper
hand
and
is
reigning
over
the
world
as
master
now
and
on
this
point
carhaix
who
is
distressed
by
these
theories
ca
reprehend
me
i
am
for
the
under
dog
that
a
generous
and
perfectly
proper
idea
but
manicheism
is
impossible
cried
the
two
infinities
can
not
exist
together
but
nothing
can
exist
if
you
get
to
reasoning
the
moment
you
argue
the
catholic
dogma
everything
goes
to
pieces
the
proof
that
two
infinities
can
coexist
is
that
this
idea
passes
beyond
reason
and
enters
the
category
of
those
things
referred
to
in
ecclesiasticus
not
into
things
higher
than
thou
for
many
things
have
shown
themselves
to
be
above
the
sense
of
men
manicheism
you
see
must
have
had
some
good
in
it
because
it
was
bathed
in
blood
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
thousands
of
albigenses
were
roasted
for
practising
this
doctrine
of
course
i
ca
say
that
the
manicheans
did
abuse
their
cult
mostly
made
up
of
devil
worship
because
we
know
very
well
they
did
on
this
point
i
am
not
with
them
he
went
on
slowly
after
a
silence
he
was
waiting
till
mme
carhaix
who
had
got
up
to
remove
the
plates
should
go
out
of
the
room
to
fetch
the
beef
while
we
are
alone
he
said
seeing
her
disappear
through
the
stairway
door
i
can
tell
you
what
they
did
an
excellent
man
named
psellus
has
revealed
to
us
in
a
book
entitled
operatione
the
fact
that
they
tasted
of
the
two
excrements
at
the
beginning
of
their
ceremonial
and
that
they
mixed
human
semen
with
the
host
horrible
exclaimed
carhaix
oh
as
they
took
both
kinds
of
communion
they
did
better
than
that
returned
des
hermies
they
cut
children
throats
and
mixed
the
blood
with
ashes
and
this
paste
dissolved
in
liquid
constituted
the
eucharistic
wine
you
bring
us
right
back
to
satanism
said
durtal
why
yes
as
you
see
i
have
strayed
off
your
subject
i
am
sure
monsieur
des
hermies
has
been
saying
something
awful
murmured
mme
carhaix
as
she
came
in
bearing
a
platter
on
which
was
a
piece
of
beef
smothered
in
vegetables
oh
madame
protested
des
hermies
they
burst
out
laughing
and
carhaix
cut
up
the
meat
while
his
wife
poured
the
cider
and
durtal
uncorked
the
bottle
of
anchovies
i
am
afraid
it
cooked
too
much
said
the
woman
who
was
a
great
deal
more
interested
in
the
beef
than
in
adventures
and
she
added
the
famous
maxim
of
housekeepers
when
the
broth
is
good
the
beef
wo
cut
the
men
protested
that
it
was
stringy
a
bit
it
was
cooked
just
right
have
an
anchovy
and
a
little
butter
with
your
meat
monsieur
durtal
wife
let
have
some
of
the
red
cabbage
that
you
preserved
said
carhaix
whose
pale
face
was
lighted
up
while
his
great
canine
eyes
were
becoming
suspiciously
moist
visibly
he
was
jubilant
he
was
at
table
with
friends
in
his
tower
safe
from
the
cold
but
empty
your
glasses
you
are
not
drinking
he
said
holding
up
the
cider
pot
let
see
des
hermies
you
were
claiming
yesterday
that
satanism
has
pursued
an
uninterrupted
course
since
the
middle
ages
said
durtal
wishing
to
get
back
to
the
subject
which
haunted
him
yes
and
the
documents
are
irrefutable
i
put
you
into
a
position
to
prove
them
whenever
you
wish
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
that
is
to
say
at
the
time
of
gilles
de
rais
to
go
no
further
back
satanism
had
assumed
the
proportions
that
you
know
in
the
sixteenth
it
was
worse
yet
no
need
to
remind
you
i
think
of
the
demoniac
pactions
of
catherine
de
medici
and
of
the
valois
of
the
trial
of
the
monk
jean
de
vaulx
of
the
investigations
of
the
sprengers
and
the
lancres
and
those
learned
inquisitors
who
had
thousands
of
necromancers
and
sorcerers
roasted
alive
all
that
is
known
too
well
known
one
case
is
not
too
well
known
for
me
to
cite
here
that
of
the
priest
benedictus
who
cohabited
with
the
armellina
and
consecrated
the
hosts
holding
them
upside
down
here
are
the
diabolical
threads
which
bind
that
century
to
this
in
the
seventeenth
century
in
which
the
sorcery
trials
continue
and
in
which
the
of
loudun
appear
the
black
religion
nourishes
but
already
it
has
been
driven
under
cover
i
will
cite
you
an
example
one
among
many
if
you
like
a
certain
abbé
guibourg
made
a
specialty
of
these
abominations
on
a
table
serving
as
tabernacle
a
woman
lay
down
naked
or
with
her
skirts
lifted
up
over
her
head
and
with
her
arms
outstretched
she
held
the
altar
lights
during
the
whole
office
guibourg
thus
celebrated
masses
on
the
abdomen
of
mme
de
montespan
of
mme
of
mme
de
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
masses
were
very
frequent
under
the
grand
monarch
numbers
of
women
went
to
them
as
in
our
times
women
flock
to
have
their
fortunes
told
with
cards
the
ritual
of
these
ceremonies
was
sufficiently
atrocious
generally
a
child
was
kidnapped
and
burnt
in
a
furnace
out
in
the
country
somewhere
the
ashes
were
saved
and
mixed
with
the
blood
of
another
child
whose
throat
had
been
cut
and
of
this
mixture
a
paste
was
made
resembling
that
of
the
manicheans
of
which
i
was
speaking
abbé
guibourg
officiated
consecrated
the
host
cut
it
into
little
pieces
and
mixed
it
with
this
mixture
of
blood
and
ashes
that
was
the
material
of
the
sacrament
what
a
horrible
priest
cried
mme
carhaix
indignant
yes
he
celebrated
another
kind
of
mass
too
that
abbé
did
it
was
called
hang
it
it
unpleasant
to
say
say
it
monsieur
des
hermies
when
people
have
as
great
a
hatred
for
that
sort
of
thing
as
we
here
they
need
not
blink
any
fact
it
that
kind
of
thing
which
is
going
to
take
me
away
from
my
prayers
nor
me
added
her
husband
well
this
sacrifice
was
called
the
spermatic
mass
oh
guibourg
wearing
the
alb
the
stole
and
the
maniple
celebrated
this
mass
with
the
sole
object
of
making
pastes
to
conjure
with
the
archives
of
the
bastille
inform
us
that
he
acted
thus
at
the
request
of
a
lady
named
des
oeillettes
this
woman
who
was
indisposed
gave
some
of
her
blood
the
man
who
accompanied
her
stood
patiently
beside
the
bed
where
the
scene
took
place
and
guibourg
gathered
up
some
of
his
semen
into
the
chalice
then
added
powdered
blood
and
some
flour
and
after
sacrilegious
ceremonies
the
des
oeillettes
woman
departed
bearing
her
paste
my
heavenly
saviour
sighed
the
wife
what
a
lot
of
filth
but
said
durtal
in
the
middle
ages
the
mass
was
celebrated
in
a
different
fashion
the
altar
then
was
the
naked
buttocks
of
a
woman
in
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
the
abdomen
and
now
nowadays
a
woman
is
hardly
ever
used
for
an
altar
but
let
us
not
anticipate
in
the
eighteenth
century
we
shall
again
find
abbés
among
how
many
other
monsters
who
defile
holy
objects
one
canon
duer
occupied
himself
specially
with
black
magic
and
the
evocation
of
the
devil
he
was
finally
executed
as
a
sorcerer
in
the
year
of
grace
there
was
another
who
believed
in
the
incarnation
of
the
holy
ghost
as
the
paraclete
and
who
in
lombary
which
he
stirred
up
to
a
feverish
pitch
of
excitement
ordained
twelve
apostles
and
twelve
apostolines
to
preach
his
gospel
this
man
abbé
beccarelli
like
all
the
other
priests
of
his
ilk
abused
both
sexes
and
he
said
mass
without
confessing
himself
of
his
lecheries
as
his
cult
grew
he
began
to
celebrate
travestied
offices
in
which
he
distributed
to
his
congregation
aphrodisiac
pills
presenting
this
peculiarity
that
after
having
swallowed
them
the
men
believed
themselves
changed
into
women
and
the
women
into
men
the
recipe
for
these
hippomanes
is
lost
continued
des
hermies
with
almost
a
sad
smile
to
make
a
long
story
short
beccarelli
met
with
a
very
miserable
end
he
was
prosecuted
for
sacrilege
and
sentenced
in
to
row
in
the
galleys
for
seven
years
these
frightful
stories
seem
to
have
taken
away
your
appetite
said
mme
carhaix
come
monsieur
des
hermies
a
little
more
salad
no
thanks
but
now
we
come
to
the
cheese
i
think
it
time
to
open
the
wine
and
he
uncapped
one
of
the
bottles
which
durtal
had
brought
it
a
light
chinon
wine
but
not
too
weak
i
discovered
it
in
a
little
shop
down
by
the
quay
said
durtal
i
see
he
went
on
after
a
silence
that
the
tradition
of
unspeakable
crimes
has
been
maintained
by
worthy
successors
of
gilles
de
rais
i
see
that
in
all
centuries
there
have
been
fallen
priests
who
have
dared
commit
sins
against
the
holy
ghost
but
at
the
present
time
it
all
seems
incredible
surely
nobody
is
cutting
children
throats
as
in
the
days
of
bluebeard
and
of
abbé
guibourg
you
mean
that
nobody
is
brought
to
justice
for
doing
it
they
assassinate
now
but
they
kill
designated
victims
by
methods
unknown
to
official
science
ah
if
the
confessionals
could
speak
cried
the
but
tell
me
what
class
of
people
are
these
modern
covenanters
with
the
devil
prelates
abbesses
mission
superiors
confessors
of
communities
and
in
rome
the
centre
of
magic
they
the
very
highest
dignitaries
answered
des
hermies
as
for
the
laymen
they
are
recruited
from
the
wealthy
class
that
explains
why
these
scandals
are
hushed
up
if
the
police
chance
to
discover
them
then
let
us
assume
that
the
sacrifices
to
the
devil
are
not
preceded
by
preliminary
murders
perhaps
in
some
cases
they
are
the
worshippers
probably
content
themselves
with
bleeding
a
foetus
which
had
been
aborted
as
soon
as
it
became
matured
to
the
point
necessary
bloodletting
is
supererogatory
anyway
and
serves
merely
to
whet
the
appetite
the
main
business
is
to
consecrate
the
host
and
put
it
to
an
infamous
use
the
rest
of
the
procedure
varies
there
is
at
present
no
regular
ritual
for
the
black
mass
well
then
is
a
priest
absolutely
essential
to
the
celebration
of
these
offices
certainly
only
a
priest
can
operate
the
mystery
of
transubstantiation
i
know
there
are
certain
occultists
who
claim
to
have
been
consecrated
by
the
lord
as
saint
paul
was
and
who
think
they
can
consummate
a
veritable
sacrifice
just
like
a
real
priest
absurd
but
even
in
default
of
real
masses
with
ordained
celebrants
the
people
possessed
by
the
mania
of
sacrilege
do
none
the
less
realize
the
sacred
stupration
of
which
they
dream
listen
to
this
in
there
existed
at
paris
an
association
composed
of
women
for
the
most
part
these
women
took
communion
several
times
a
day
and
retained
the
sacred
wafer
in
their
mouths
to
be
spat
out
later
and
trodden
underfoot
or
soiled
by
disgusting
contacts
you
are
sure
of
it
perfectly
these
facts
were
revealed
by
a
religious
journal
annales
de
la
and
the
archbishop
of
paris
could
not
deny
them
i
add
that
in
women
were
likewise
enrolled
at
paris
to
practise
this
odious
commerce
they
were
paid
so
much
for
every
wafer
they
brought
in
that
explains
why
they
presented
themselves
at
the
sacred
table
of
different
churches
every
day
and
that
is
not
the
half
of
it
look
said
carhaix
in
his
turn
rising
and
taking
from
his
bookshelf
a
blue
brochurette
here
is
a
review
voix
de
la
dated
it
informs
us
that
for
years
at
agen
a
satanistic
association
regularly
celebrated
black
masses
and
committed
murder
and
polluted
three
thousand
three
hundred
and
twenty
hosts
and
monsignor
the
bishop
of
agen
who
was
a
good
and
ardent
prelate
never
dared
deny
the
monstrosities
committed
in
his
diocese
yes
we
can
say
it
among
ourselves
des
hermies
returned
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
number
of
abbés
has
been
legion
unhappily
though
the
documents
are
certain
they
are
difficult
to
verify
for
no
ecclesiastic
boasts
of
such
misdeeds
the
celebrants
of
deicidal
masses
dissemble
and
declare
themselves
devoted
to
christ
they
even
affirm
that
they
defend
him
by
exorcising
the
possessed
that
a
good
one
the
are
made
so
or
kept
so
by
the
priests
themselves
who
are
thus
assured
of
subjects
and
accomplices
especially
in
the
convents
all
kinds
of
murderous
and
sadistic
follies
can
be
covered
with
the
antique
and
pious
mantle
of
exorcism
let
us
be
just
said
carhaix
the
satanist
would
not
be
complete
if
he
were
not
an
abominable
hypocrite
hypocrisy
and
pride
are
perhaps
the
most
characteristic
vices
of
the
perverse
priest
suggested
durtal
but
in
the
long
run
des
hermies
went
on
in
spite
of
the
most
adroit
precautions
everything
comes
out
up
to
now
i
have
spoken
only
of
local
satanistic
associations
but
there
are
others
more
extensive
which
ravage
the
old
world
and
the
new
for
diabolism
is
quite
up
to
date
in
one
respect
it
is
highly
centralized
and
very
capably
administered
there
are
committees
subcommittees
a
sort
of
curia
which
rules
america
and
europe
like
the
curia
of
a
pope
the
biggest
of
these
societies
founded
as
long
ago
as
is
the
society
of
the
beneath
an
apparent
unity
it
is
divided
into
two
camps
one
aspiring
to
destroy
the
universe
and
reign
over
the
ruins
the
other
thinking
simply
of
imposing
upon
the
world
a
demoniac
cult
of
which
it
shall
be
high
priest
this
society
has
its
seat
in
america
it
was
formerly
directed
by
one
longfellow
an
adventurer
born
in
scotland
who
entitled
himself
grand
priest
of
the
new
evocative
magism
for
a
long
time
it
has
had
branches
in
france
italy
germany
russia
austria
even
turkey
it
is
at
the
present
moment
moribund
or
perhaps
quite
dead
but
another
has
just
been
created
the
object
of
this
one
is
to
elect
an
antipope
who
will
be
the
exterminating
antichrist
and
those
are
only
two
of
them
how
many
others
are
there
more
or
less
important
numerically
more
or
less
secret
which
by
common
accord
at
ten
the
morning
of
the
feast
of
the
holy
sacrament
celebrate
black
masses
at
paris
rome
bruges
constantinople
nantes
lyons
and
in
scotland
where
sorcerers
swarm
then
outside
of
these
universal
associations
and
local
assemblies
isolated
cases
abound
on
which
little
light
can
be
shed
and
that
with
great
difficulty
some
years
ago
there
died
in
a
state
of
penitence
a
certain
comte
de
lautree
who
presented
several
churches
with
statues
which
he
had
bewitched
so
as
to
satanize
the
faithful
at
bruges
a
priest
of
my
acquaintance
contaminates
the
holy
ciboria
and
uses
them
to
prepare
spells
and
conjurements
finally
one
may
among
all
these
cite
a
clear
case
of
possession
it
is
the
case
of
cantianille
who
in
turned
not
only
the
city
of
auxerre
but
the
whole
diocese
of
sens
upside
down
this
cantianille
placed
in
a
convent
of
was
violated
when
she
was
barely
fifteen
years
old
by
a
priest
who
dedicated
her
to
the
devil
this
priest
himself
had
been
corrupted
in
early
childhood
by
an
ecclesiastic
belonging
to
a
sect
of
possessed
which
was
created
the
very
day
louis
xvi
was
guillotined
what
happened
in
this
convent
where
many
nuns
evidently
mad
with
hysteria
were
associated
in
erotic
devilry
and
sacrilegious
rages
with
cantianille
reads
for
all
the
world
like
the
procedure
in
the
trials
of
wizards
of
long
ago
the
histories
of
gaufrédy
and
madeleine
palud
of
urbain
grandier
and
madeleine
bavent
or
the
jesuit
girard
and
la
cadière
histories
by
the
way
in
which
much
might
be
said
about
on
one
hand
and
about
diabolism
on
the
other
at
any
rate
cantianille
after
being
sent
away
from
the
convent
was
exorcised
by
a
certain
priest
of
the
diocese
abbé
thorey
who
seems
to
have
been
contaminated
by
his
patient
soon
at
auxerre
there
were
such
scandalous
scenes
such
frenzied
outbursts
of
diabolism
that
the
bishop
had
to
intervene
cantianille
was
driven
out
of
the
country
abbé
thorey
was
disciplined
and
the
affair
went
to
rome
the
curious
thing
about
it
is
that
the
bishop
terrified
by
what
he
had
seen
requested
to
be
dismissed
and
retired
to
fontainebleau
where
he
died
still
in
terror
two
years
later
my
friends
said
carhaix
consulting
his
watch
it
is
a
quarter
to
eight
i
must
be
going
up
into
the
tower
to
sound
the
angelus
wait
for
me
have
your
coffee
i
shall
rejoin
you
in
ten
minutes
he
put
on
his
greenland
costume
lighted
a
lantern
and
opened
the
door
a
stream
of
glacial
air
poured
in
white
molecules
whirled
in
the
blackness
the
wind
is
driving
the
snow
in
through
the
loopholes
along
the
stair
said
the
woman
i
am
always
afraid
that
louis
will
take
cold
in
his
chest
this
kind
of
weather
oh
well
monsieur
des
hermies
here
is
the
coffee
i
appoint
you
to
the
task
of
serving
it
at
this
hour
of
day
my
poor
old
limbs
wo
hold
me
up
any
longer
i
must
go
lie
down
the
fact
is
sighed
des
hermies
when
they
had
wished
her
good
night
the
fact
is
that
mama
carhaix
is
rapidly
getting
old
i
have
vainly
tried
to
brace
her
up
with
tonics
they
do
no
good
she
has
worn
herself
out
she
has
climbed
too
many
stairs
in
her
life
poor
woman
all
the
same
it
very
curious
what
you
have
told
me
said
durtal
to
sum
up
the
most
important
thing
about
satanism
is
the
black
mass
that
and
the
witchcraft
and
incubacy
and
succubacy
which
i
will
tell
you
about
or
rather
i
will
get
another
more
expert
than
i
in
these
matters
to
tell
you
about
them
sacrilegious
mass
spells
and
succubacy
there
you
have
the
real
quintessence
of
satanism
and
these
hosts
consecrated
in
blasphemous
offices
what
use
is
made
of
them
when
they
are
not
simply
destroyed
but
i
already
told
you
they
are
used
to
consummate
infamous
acts
listen
and
des
hermies
took
from
the
bookshelf
the
fifth
volume
of
the
of
görres
here
is
the
flower
of
them
all
priests
in
their
baseness
often
go
so
far
as
to
celebrate
the
mass
with
great
hosts
which
then
they
cut
through
the
middle
and
afterwards
glue
to
a
parchment
similarly
cloven
and
use
abominably
to
satisfy
their
passions
holy
sodomy
in
other
words
exactly
at
this
moment
the
bell
set
in
motion
in
the
tower
boomed
out
the
chamber
in
which
durtal
and
des
hermies
were
sitting
trembled
and
a
droning
filled
the
air
it
seemed
that
waves
of
sound
came
out
of
the
walls
unrolling
in
a
spiral
from
the
very
rock
and
that
one
was
transported
in
a
dream
into
the
inside
of
one
of
these
shells
which
when
held
up
to
the
ear
simulate
the
roar
of
rolling
billows
des
hermies
accustomed
to
the
mighty
resonance
of
the
bells
at
short
range
thought
only
of
the
coffee
which
he
had
put
on
the
stove
to
keep
hot
then
the
booming
of
the
bell
came
more
slowly
the
humming
departed
from
the
air
the
window
panes
the
glass
of
the
bookcase
the
tumblers
on
the
table
ceased
to
rattle
and
gave
off
only
a
tenuous
tinkling
a
step
was
heard
on
the
stair
carhaix
entered
covered
with
snow
cristi
boys
it
blows
he
shook
himself
threw
his
heavy
outer
garments
on
a
chair
and
extinguished
his
lantern
there
were
blinding
clouds
of
snow
whirling
in
between
the
i
can
hardly
see
dog
weather
the
lady
has
gone
to
bed
good
but
you
drunk
your
coffee
he
asked
as
he
saw
durtal
filling
the
glasses
carhaix
went
up
to
the
stove
and
poked
the
fire
then
dried
his
eyes
which
the
bitter
cold
had
filled
with
tears
and
drank
a
great
draught
of
coffee
now
that
hits
the
spot
how
far
had
you
got
with
your
lecture
des
hermies
i
finished
the
rapid
expose
of
satanism
but
i
have
yet
spoken
of
the
genuine
monster
the
only
real
master
that
exists
at
the
present
time
that
defrocked
abbé
oh
exclaimed
carhaix
take
care
the
mere
name
of
that
man
brings
disaster
bah
canon
docre
to
utter
his
ineffable
name
can
do
nothing
to
us
i
confess
i
can
not
understand
why
he
should
inspire
any
terror
but
never
mind
i
should
like
for
durtal
before
we
hunt
up
the
canon
to
see
your
friend
gévingey
who
seems
to
be
best
and
most
intimately
acquainted
with
him
a
conversation
with
gévingey
would
considerably
amplify
my
contributions
to
the
study
of
satanism
especially
as
regards
venefices
and
succubacy
let
see
would
you
mind
if
we
invited
him
here
to
dine
carhaix
scratched
his
head
then
emptied
the
ashes
of
his
pipe
on
his
thumbnail
well
you
see
the
fact
is
we
have
had
a
slight
disagreement
what
about
oh
nothing
very
serious
i
interrupted
his
experiments
here
one
day
but
pour
yourself
some
liqueur
monsieur
durtal
and
you
des
hermies
why
you
are
drinking
at
all
and
while
lighting
their
cigarettes
both
sipped
a
few
drops
of
almost
proof
cognac
carhaix
resumed
gévingey
who
though
an
astrologer
is
a
good
christian
and
an
honest
man
whom
indeed
i
should
be
glad
to
see
again
wished
to
consult
my
bells
that
surprises
you
but
it
so
bells
formerly
played
quite
an
important
part
in
the
forbidden
science
the
art
of
predicting
the
future
with
their
sounds
is
one
of
the
least
known
and
most
disused
branches
of
the
occult
gévingey
had
dug
up
some
documents
and
wished
to
verify
them
in
the
tower
why
what
did
he
do
how
do
i
know
he
stood
under
the
bell
at
the
risk
of
breaking
his
bones
a
man
of
his
age
on
the
scaffolding
there
he
was
halfway
into
the
bell
the
bell
like
a
great
hat
you
see
coming
clear
down
over
his
hips
and
he
soliloquized
aloud
and
listened
to
the
repercussions
of
his
voice
making
the
bronze
vibrate
he
spoke
to
me
also
of
the
interpretation
of
dreams
about
bells
according
to
him
whoever
in
his
sleep
sees
bells
swinging
is
menaced
by
an
accident
if
the
bell
chimes
it
is
presage
of
slander
if
it
falls
ataxia
is
certain
if
it
breaks
it
is
assurance
of
afflictions
and
miseries
finally
he
added
i
believe
that
if
the
night
birds
fly
around
a
bell
by
moonlight
one
may
be
sure
that
sacrilegious
robbery
will
be
committed
in
the
church
or
that
the
curate
life
is
in
danger
be
all
that
as
it
may
this
business
of
touching
the
bells
getting
up
into
them
and
you
know
they
consecrated
of
attributing
to
them
the
gift
of
prophecy
of
involving
them
in
the
interpretation
of
dream
an
art
formally
forbidden
in
leviticus
displeased
me
and
i
demanded
somewhat
rudely
that
he
desist
but
you
did
not
quarrel
no
and
i
confess
i
regret
having
been
so
hasty
well
then
i
will
arrange
it
i
shall
go
see
him
agreed
said
des
hermies
by
all
means
with
that
we
must
run
along
and
give
you
a
chance
to
get
to
bed
seeing
that
you
have
to
be
up
at
dawn
oh
at
five
for
the
six
angelus
and
then
if
i
want
to
i
can
go
back
to
bed
for
i
do
have
to
ring
again
till
a
quarter
to
eight
and
then
all
i
have
to
do
is
sound
a
couple
of
times
for
the
curate
mass
as
you
can
see
i
have
a
pretty
easy
thing
of
it
mmmm
exclaimed
durtal
if
i
had
to
get
up
so
early
it
all
a
matter
of
habit
but
before
you
go
wo
you
have
another
little
drink
no
really
well
good
night
he
lighted
his
lantern
and
in
single
file
shivering
they
descended
the
glacial
winding
stair
chapter
vi
next
morning
durtal
woke
later
than
usual
before
he
opened
his
eyes
there
was
a
sudden
flash
of
light
in
his
brain
and
troops
of
demon
worshippers
like
the
societies
of
which
des
hermies
had
spoken
went
defiling
past
him
dancing
a
saraband
a
swarm
of
lady
acrobats
hanging
head
downward
from
trapezes
and
praying
with
joined
feet
he
said
yawning
he
looked
at
the
window
the
panes
were
flowered
with
crystal
fleurs
de
lys
and
frost
ferns
then
he
quickly
drew
his
arms
back
under
the
covers
and
snuggled
up
luxuriously
a
fine
day
to
stay
at
home
and
work
he
said
i
will
get
up
and
light
a
fire
come
now
a
little
courage
and
instead
of
tossing
the
covers
aside
he
drew
them
up
around
his
chin
ah
i
know
that
you
are
not
pleased
to
see
me
taking
a
morning
off
he
said
addressing
his
cat
which
was
hunched
up
on
the
counterpane
at
his
feet
gazing
at
him
fixedly
its
eyes
very
black
this
beast
though
affectionate
and
fond
of
being
caressed
was
crabbed
and
set
in
its
ways
it
would
tolerate
no
whims
no
departures
from
the
regular
course
of
things
it
understood
that
there
was
a
fixed
hour
for
rising
and
for
going
to
bed
and
when
it
was
displeased
it
allowed
a
shade
of
annoyance
to
pass
into
its
eyes
the
sense
of
which
its
master
could
not
mistake
if
he
returned
before
eleven
at
night
the
cat
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
vestibule
scratching
the
wood
of
the
door
miaouing
even
before
durtal
was
in
the
hall
then
it
rolled
its
languorous
eyes
at
him
rubbed
against
his
trouser
leg
stood
up
on
its
hind
feet
like
a
tiny
rearing
horse
and
affectionately
wagged
its
head
at
him
as
he
approached
if
eleven
had
passed
it
did
not
run
along
in
front
of
him
but
would
only
very
grudgingly
rise
when
he
came
up
and
then
it
would
arch
its
back
and
suffer
no
caresses
when
he
came
later
yet
it
would
not
budge
and
would
complain
and
groan
if
he
took
the
liberty
of
stroking
its
head
or
scratching
its
throat
this
morning
it
had
no
patience
with
durtal
laziness
it
squatted
on
its
hunkers
and
swelled
up
then
it
approached
stealthily
and
sat
down
two
steps
away
from
its
master
face
staring
at
him
with
an
atrociously
false
eye
signifying
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
abdicate
and
leave
the
warm
place
for
a
cold
cat
amused
by
its
manoeuvres
durtal
did
not
move
but
returned
its
stare
the
cat
was
enormous
common
and
yet
bizarre
with
its
rusty
coat
yellowish
like
old
coke
ashes
and
grey
as
the
fuzz
on
a
new
broom
with
little
white
tufts
like
the
fleece
which
flies
up
from
the
faggot
it
was
a
genuine
gutter
cat
with
a
head
it
was
regularly
striped
with
waving
lines
of
ebony
its
paws
were
encircled
by
black
bracelets
and
its
eyes
lengthened
by
two
great
zigzags
of
ink
in
spite
of
your
character
and
your
single
track
mind
you
testy
old
bachelor
you
are
a
very
nice
cat
said
durtal
in
an
insinuating
wheedling
tone
then
too
for
many
years
now
i
have
told
you
what
one
tells
no
man
you
are
the
drain
pipe
of
my
soul
you
inattentive
and
indulgent
confessor
never
shocked
you
vaguely
approve
the
mental
misdeeds
which
i
confess
to
you
you
let
me
relieve
myself
and
you
do
charge
me
anything
for
the
service
frankly
that
is
what
you
are
here
for
i
spoil
you
with
care
and
attentions
because
you
are
the
spiritual
vent
of
solitude
and
celibacy
but
that
does
prevent
you
with
your
spiteful
way
of
looking
at
me
from
being
insufferable
at
times
as
you
are
today
for
instance
the
cat
continued
to
stare
at
him
its
ears
sticking
straight
up
as
if
they
would
catch
the
sense
of
his
words
from
the
inflections
of
his
voice
it
understood
doubtless
that
durtal
was
not
disposed
to
jump
out
of
bed
for
it
went
back
to
its
old
place
but
now
turned
its
back
full
on
him
oh
come
said
durtal
discouraged
looking
at
his
watch
i
simply
got
to
get
up
and
go
to
work
on
gilles
de
rais
and
with
a
bound
he
sprang
into
his
trousers
the
cat
rising
suddenly
galloped
across
the
counterpane
and
rolled
itself
up
into
the
warm
covers
without
waiting
an
instant
longer
how
cold
it
is
and
durtal
slipped
on
a
knit
jacket
and
went
into
the
other
room
to
start
a
fire
i
shall
freeze
he
murmured
fortunately
his
apartment
was
easy
to
heat
it
consisted
simply
of
a
hall
a
tiny
a
minute
bedroom
and
a
large
enough
bathroom
it
was
on
the
fifth
floor
facing
a
sufficiently
airy
court
rent
eight
hundred
francs
it
was
furnished
without
luxury
the
little
durtal
had
converted
into
a
study
hiding
the
walls
behind
black
wood
bookcases
crammed
with
books
in
front
of
the
window
were
a
great
table
a
leather
armchair
and
a
few
straight
chairs
he
had
removed
the
glass
from
the
mantelpiece
and
in
the
panel
just
over
the
mantelshelf
which
was
covered
with
an
old
fabric
he
had
nailed
an
antique
painting
on
wood
representing
a
hermit
kneeling
beside
a
cardinal
hat
and
purple
cloak
beneath
a
hut
of
boughs
the
colours
of
the
landscape
background
had
faded
the
blues
to
grey
the
whites
to
russet
the
greens
to
black
and
time
had
darkened
the
shadows
to
a
hue
along
the
edges
of
the
picture
almost
against
the
black
oak
frame
a
continuous
narrative
unfolded
in
unintelligible
episodes
intruding
one
upon
the
other
portraying
lilliputian
figures
in
houses
of
dwarfs
here
the
saint
whose
name
durtal
had
sought
in
vain
crossed
a
curly
wooden
sea
in
a
sailboat
there
he
marched
through
a
village
as
big
as
a
fingernail
then
he
disappeared
into
the
shadows
of
the
painting
and
was
discovered
higher
up
in
a
grotto
in
the
orient
surrounded
by
dromedaries
and
bales
of
merchandise
again
he
was
lost
from
sight
and
after
another
game
of
he
emerged
smaller
than
ever
quite
alone
with
a
staff
in
his
hand
and
a
knapsack
on
his
back
mounting
toward
a
strange
unfinished
cathedral
it
was
a
picture
by
an
unknown
painter
an
old
dutchman
who
had
perhaps
visited
certain
of
the
italian
masters
for
he
had
appropriated
colours
and
processes
peculiar
to
them
the
bedroom
contained
a
big
bed
a
chest
of
drawers
and
some
easy
chairs
on
the
mantel
were
an
antique
clock
and
copper
candlesticks
on
the
wall
there
was
a
fine
photograph
of
a
botticelli
in
the
berlin
museum
representing
a
plump
and
penitent
virgin
who
was
like
a
housewife
in
tears
she
was
surrounded
by
and
the
languishing
young
men
held
spliced
wax
tapers
that
were
like
bits
of
rope
the
coquettish
hoydens
had
flowers
stuck
in
their
long
hair
and
the
mischievous
looked
rapturously
at
the
infant
jesus
who
stood
beside
the
virgin
and
held
out
his
hands
in
benediction
then
there
was
a
print
of
breughel
engraved
by
cock
the
wise
and
the
foolish
virgins
a
little
panel
cut
in
the
middle
by
a
corkscrew
cloud
which
was
flanked
at
each
side
by
angels
with
their
sleeves
rolled
up
and
their
cheeks
puffed
out
sounding
the
trumpet
while
in
the
middle
of
the
cloud
another
angel
bizarre
and
sacerdotal
with
his
navel
indicated
beneath
his
languorously
flowing
robe
unrolled
a
banderole
on
which
was
written
the
verse
of
the
gospel
sponsus
venit
exite
obviam
beneath
the
cloud
at
one
side
sat
the
wise
virgins
good
flemings
with
their
lighted
lamps
and
sang
canticles
as
they
turned
the
spinning
wheel
at
the
other
side
were
the
foolish
virgins
with
their
empty
lamps
four
joyous
gossips
were
holding
hands
and
dancing
in
a
ring
on
the
greensward
while
the
fifth
played
the
bagpipe
and
beat
time
with
her
foot
above
the
cloud
the
five
wise
virgins
slender
and
ethereal
now
naked
and
charming
brandished
flaming
tapers
and
mounted
toward
a
gothic
church
where
christ
stood
to
welcome
them
while
on
the
other
side
the
foolish
virgins
imperfectly
draped
beat
vainly
on
a
closed
door
with
their
dead
torches
the
blessed
naïveté
of
the
primitives
the
homely
touches
in
the
scenes
of
earth
and
of
heaven
durtal
loved
this
old
engraving
he
saw
in
it
a
union
of
the
art
of
an
ostade
purified
and
that
of
a
thierry
bouts
waiting
for
his
grate
in
which
the
charcoal
was
crackling
and
peeling
and
running
like
frying
grease
to
become
red
he
sat
down
in
front
of
his
desk
and
ran
over
his
notes
let
see
he
said
to
himself
rolling
a
cigarette
we
had
come
to
the
time
when
that
excellent
gilles
de
rais
begins
the
quest
of
the
work
it
is
easy
to
figure
what
knowledge
he
possessed
about
the
method
of
transmuting
metals
into
gold
alchemy
was
already
highly
developed
a
century
before
he
was
born
the
writings
of
albertus
magnus
arnaud
de
villeneuve
and
raymond
lully
were
in
the
hands
of
the
hermetics
the
manuscripts
of
nicolas
flamel
circulated
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
gilles
had
acquired
them
for
he
was
an
avid
collector
of
the
rare
let
us
add
that
at
that
epoch
the
edict
of
charles
interdicting
spagyric
labours
under
pain
of
prison
and
hanging
and
the
bull
pariter
quas
non
which
pope
john
xxii
fulminated
against
the
alchemists
were
still
in
vigour
these
treatises
were
then
forbidden
and
in
consequence
desirable
it
is
certain
that
gilles
had
long
studied
them
but
from
that
to
understanding
them
is
a
far
cry
for
they
were
written
in
an
impossible
jargon
of
allegories
twisted
and
obscure
metaphors
incoherent
symbols
ambiguous
parables
enigmas
and
ciphers
and
here
is
an
example
he
took
from
one
of
the
shelves
of
the
library
a
manuscript
which
was
none
other
than
the
the
book
of
the
jew
abraham
and
of
nicolas
flamel
restored
translated
and
annotated
by
eliphas
levi
this
manuscript
had
been
lent
him
by
des
hermies
who
had
discovered
it
one
day
among
some
old
papers
in
this
is
what
claims
to
be
the
recipe
for
the
philosopher
stone
for
the
grand
quintessential
and
tinctural
essence
the
figures
are
not
precisely
clear
he
said
to
himself
as
he
ran
his
eye
over
the
pen
drawings
retouched
in
colour
representing
under
the
title
of
chemical
various
bottles
and
flasks
each
containing
a
liquid
and
imprisoning
an
allegorical
creature
a
green
lion
with
a
crescent
moon
over
him
hung
head
downward
doves
were
trying
to
fly
out
through
the
neck
of
the
bottle
or
to
peck
a
way
through
the
bottom
the
liquid
was
black
and
undulated
with
waves
of
carmine
and
gold
or
white
and
granulated
with
dots
of
ink
which
sometimes
took
the
shape
of
a
frog
or
a
star
sometimes
the
liquid
was
milky
and
troubled
sometimes
flames
rose
from
it
as
if
there
were
a
film
of
alcohol
over
the
surface
eliphas
levi
explained
the
symbolism
of
these
bottled
volatiles
as
fully
as
he
cared
to
but
abstained
from
giving
the
famous
recipe
for
the
grand
magisterium
he
was
keeping
up
the
pleasantry
of
his
other
books
in
which
beginning
with
an
air
of
solemnity
he
affirmed
his
intention
of
unveiling
the
old
arcana
and
when
the
time
came
to
fulfil
his
promise
begged
the
question
alleging
the
excuse
that
he
would
perish
if
he
betrayed
such
burning
secrets
the
same
excuse
which
had
done
duty
through
the
ages
served
in
masking
the
perfect
ignorance
of
the
cheap
occultists
of
the
present
day
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
work
is
simple
said
durtal
to
himself
folding
up
the
manuscript
of
nicolas
flamel
the
hermetic
philosophers
discovered
and
modern
science
after
long
evading
the
issue
no
longer
denies
that
the
metals
are
compounds
and
that
their
components
are
identical
they
vary
from
each
other
according
to
the
different
proportions
of
their
elements
with
the
aid
of
an
agent
which
will
displace
these
proportions
one
may
transmute
mercury
for
example
into
silver
and
lead
into
gold
and
this
agent
is
the
philosopher
stone
mercury
not
the
vulgar
mercury
which
to
the
alchemists
was
but
an
aborted
metallic
sperm
but
the
philosophers
mercury
called
also
the
green
lion
the
serpent
the
milk
of
the
virgin
the
pontic
water
only
the
recipe
for
this
mercury
or
stone
of
the
sages
has
ever
been
revealed
and
it
is
this
that
the
philosophers
of
the
middle
ages
the
renaissance
all
centuries
including
our
own
have
sought
so
frantically
and
in
what
has
it
not
been
sought
said
durtal
thumbing
his
notes
in
arsenic
in
ordinary
mercury
tin
salts
of
vitriol
saltpetre
and
nitre
in
the
juices
of
spurge
poppy
and
purslane
in
the
bellies
of
starved
toads
in
human
urine
in
the
menstrual
fluid
and
the
milk
of
women
now
gilles
de
rais
must
have
been
completely
baffled
alone
at
tiffauges
without
the
aid
of
initiates
he
was
incapable
of
making
fruitful
experiments
at
that
time
paris
was
the
centre
of
the
hermetic
science
in
france
the
alchemists
gathered
under
the
vaults
of
notre
dame
and
studied
the
hieroglyphics
which
nicolas
flamel
before
he
died
had
written
on
the
walls
of
the
charnal
des
innocents
and
on
the
portal
of
saint
jacques
de
la
boucherie
describing
cabalistically
the
preparation
of
the
famous
stone
the
marshal
could
not
go
to
paris
because
the
english
soldiers
barred
the
roads
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
he
wrote
to
the
most
celebrated
of
the
southern
transmuters
and
had
them
brought
to
tiffauges
at
great
expense
from
documents
which
we
posses
we
can
see
his
supervising
the
construction
of
the
athanor
or
alchemists
furnace
buying
pelicans
crucibles
and
retorts
he
turned
one
of
the
wings
of
his
château
into
a
laboratory
and
shut
himself
up
in
it
with
antonio
di
palermo
françois
lombard
and
petit
goldsmith
of
paris
all
of
whom
busied
themselves
night
and
day
with
the
concoction
of
the
work
they
were
completely
unsuccessful
at
the
end
of
their
resources
these
hermetists
disappeared
and
there
ensued
at
tiffauges
an
incredible
of
adepts
and
their
helpers
they
arrived
from
all
parts
of
brittany
poitou
and
maine
alone
or
escorted
by
promoters
and
sorcerers
gilles
de
sillé
and
roger
de
bricqueville
cousins
and
friends
of
the
marshal
scurried
about
the
country
beating
up
the
game
and
driving
it
in
to
gilles
de
rais
while
a
priest
of
his
chapel
eustache
blanchet
went
to
italy
where
workers
in
metals
were
legion
while
waiting
gilles
de
rais
not
to
be
discouraged
continued
his
experiments
all
of
which
missed
fire
he
finally
came
to
believe
that
the
magicians
were
right
after
all
and
that
no
discovery
was
possible
without
the
aid
of
satan
and
one
night
with
a
sorcerer
newly
arrived
from
poitiers
jean
de
la
rivière
he
betakes
himself
to
a
forest
in
the
vicinity
of
the
château
de
tiffauges
with
his
servitors
henriet
and
poitou
he
remains
on
the
verge
of
the
wood
into
which
the
sorcerer
penetrates
the
night
is
heavy
and
there
is
no
moon
gilles
becomes
nervous
scrutinizing
the
shadows
listening
to
the
muted
sounds
of
the
nocturnal
landscape
his
companions
terrified
huddle
close
together
trembling
and
whispering
at
the
slightest
stirring
of
the
air
suddenly
a
cry
of
anguish
is
raised
they
hesitate
then
they
advance
groping
in
the
darkness
in
a
sudden
flare
of
light
they
perceive
de
la
rivière
trembling
and
deathly
pale
clutching
the
handle
of
his
lantern
convulsively
in
a
low
voice
he
recounts
how
the
devil
has
risen
in
the
form
of
a
leopard
and
rushed
past
without
looking
at
the
evocator
without
saying
a
word
the
next
day
the
sorcerer
vanished
but
another
arrived
this
was
a
bungler
named
du
mesnil
he
required
gilles
to
sign
with
blood
a
deed
binding
him
to
give
the
devil
all
the
devil
asked
of
him
except
his
life
and
soul
but
although
to
aid
the
conjurements
gilles
consented
to
have
the
office
of
the
damned
sung
in
his
chapel
on
all
saints
day
satan
did
not
appear
the
marshal
was
beginning
to
doubt
the
powers
of
his
magicians
when
the
outcome
of
a
new
endeavor
convinced
him
that
frequently
the
devil
does
appear
an
evocator
whose
name
has
been
lost
held
a
séance
with
gilles
and
de
sillé
in
a
chamber
at
tiffauges
on
the
ground
he
traces
a
great
circle
and
commands
his
two
companions
to
step
inside
it
sillé
refuses
gripped
by
a
terror
which
he
can
not
explain
he
begins
to
tremble
all
over
he
goes
to
the
window
opens
it
and
stands
ready
for
flight
murmuring
exorcisms
under
his
breath
gilles
bolder
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
but
at
the
first
conjurgations
he
too
trembles
and
tries
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
sorcerer
orders
him
not
to
budge
at
one
moment
he
feels
something
seize
him
by
the
neck
he
vacillates
supplicating
our
lady
to
save
him
the
evocator
furious
throws
him
out
of
the
circle
gilles
precipitates
himself
through
the
door
de
sillé
jumps
out
of
the
window
they
meet
below
and
stand
aghast
howls
are
heard
in
the
chamber
where
the
magician
is
operating
there
is
a
sound
as
of
sword
strokes
raining
on
a
wooden
billet
then
groans
cries
of
distress
the
appeals
of
a
man
being
assassinated
they
stand
rooted
to
the
spot
when
the
clamour
ceases
they
venture
to
open
the
door
and
find
the
sorcerer
lying

with
remorse

the
man
his
own
bed

him
and
has
him

for
several
days
the
sorcerer

between

and

but
finally
recovers
and
flees
from
the
castle
gilles
was
despairing
of
obtaining
from
the
devil
the
recipe
for
the
sovereign
magisterium
when
eustache
blanchet
return
from
italy
was
announced
eustache
brought
the
master
of
florentine
magic
the
irresistible
evoker
of
demons
and
larvæ
francesco
prelati
this
man
struck
awe
into
gilles
barely
years
old
he
was
one
of
the
wittiest
the
most
erudite
and
the
most
polished
men
of
the
time
what
had
he
done
before
he
came
to
install
himself
at
tiffauges
there
to
begin
with
gilles
the
most
frightful
series
of
sins
against
the
holy
ghost
that
has
ever
been
known
his
testimony
in
the
criminal
trial
of
gilles
does
not
furnish
us
any
very
detailed
information
on
his
own
score
he
was
born
in
the
diocese
of
lucca
at
pistoia
and
had
been
ordained
a
priest
by
the
bishop
of
arezzo
some
time
after
his
entrance
into
the
priesthood
he
had
become
the
pupil
of
a
thaumaturge
of
florence
jean
de
fontenelle
and
had
signed
a
pact
with
a
demon
named
barron
from
that
moment
onward
this
insinuating
and
persuasive
learned
and
charming
abbé
must
have
given
himself
over
to
the
most
abominable
of
sacrileges
and
the
most
murderous
practices
of
black
magic
at
any
rate
gilles
came
completely
under
the
influence
of
this
man
the
extinguished
furnaces
were
relighted
and
that
stone
of
the
sages
which
prelati
had
seen
flexible
frail
red
and
smelling
of
calcinated
marine
salt
they
sought
together
furiously
invoking
hell
their
incantations
were
all
in
vain
gilles
disconsolate
redoubled
them
but
they
finally
produced
a
dreadful
result
and
prelati
narrowly
escaped
with
his
life
one
afternoon
eustache
blanchet
in
a
gallery
of
the
château
perceives
the
marshal
weeping
bitterly
plaints
of
supplication
are
heard
through
the
door
of
a
chamber
in
which
prelati
has
been
evoking
the
devil
the
demon
is
in
there
beating
my
poor
francis
i
implore
you
go
in
cries
gilles
but
blanchet
frightened
refuses
then
gilles
makes
up
his
mind
in
spite
of
his
fear
he
is
advancing
to
force
the
door
when
it
opens
and
prelati
staggers
out
and
falls
bleeding
into
his
arms
prelati
is
able
with
the
support
of
his
friends
to
gain
the
chamber
of
the
marshal
where
he
is
put
to
bed
but
he
has
sustained
so
merciless
a
thrashing
that
he
goes
into
delirium
and
his
fever
keeps
mounting
gilles
in
despair
stays
beside
him
cares
for
him
has
him
confessed
and
weeps
for
joy
when
prelati
is
out
of
danger
the
fate
of
the
unknown
sorcerer
and
of
prelati
both
getting
dangerously
wounded
in
an
empty
room
under
identical
circumstances
i
tell
you
it
a
remarkable
coincidence
said
durtal
to
himself
and
the
documents
which
relate
these
facts
are
authentic
they
are
indeed
excerpts
from
the
procedure
in
gilles
trial
the
confessions
of
the
accused
and
the
depositions
of
the
witnesses
agree
and
it
is
impossible
to
think
that
gilles
and
prelati
lied
for
in
confessing
these
satanic
evocations
they
condemned
themselves
by
their
own
words
to
be
burned
alive
if
in
addition
they
had
declared
that
the
evil
one
had
appeared
to
them
that
they
had
been
visited
by
succubi
if
they
had
affirmed
that
they
had
heard
voices
smelled
odours
even
touched
a
body
we
might
conclude
that
they
had
had
hallucinations
similar
to
those
of
certain
bicêtre
subjects
but
as
it
was
there
could
have
been
no
misfunctioning
of
the
senses
no
morbid
visions
because
the
wounds
the
marks
of
the
blows
the
material
fact
visible
and
tangible
are
present
for
testimony
imagine
how
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
reality
of
the
devil
a
mystic
like
gilles
de
rais
must
have
been
after
witnessing
such
scenes
in
spite
of
his
discomfitures
he
could
not
doubt
and
prelati
must
have
doubted
even
less
that
if
satan
pleased
they
should
finally
find
this
powder
which
would
load
them
with
riches
and
even
render
them
almost
immortal
for
at
that
epoch
the
stone
passed
not
only
for
an
agent
in
the
transmutation
of
base
metals
such
as
tin
lead
copper
into
noble
metals
like
silver
and
gold
but
also
for
a
panacea
curing
all
ailments
and
prolonging
life
without
infirmities
beyond
the
limits
formerly
assigned
to
the
patriarchs
singular
science
ruminated
durtal
raising
the
fender
of
his
fireplace
and
warming
his
feet
in
spite
of
the
railleries
of
this
time
which
in
the
matter
of
discoveries
but
exhumes
lost
things
the
hermetic
philosophy
was
not
wholly
vain
the
master
of
contemporary
science
dumas
recognizes
under
the
name
of
isomery
the
theories
of
the
alchemists
and
berthelot
declares
one
can
affirm
that
the
fabrication
of
bodies
reputed
to
be
simple
is
impossible
then
there
have
been
verified
and
certified
achievements
besides
nicolas
flamel
who
really
seems
to
have
succeeded
in
the
work
the
chemist
van
helmont
in
the
eighteenth
century
received
from
an
unknown
man
a
quarter
of
a
grain
of
philosopher
stone
and
with
it
transformed
eight
ounces
of
mercury
into
gold
at
the
same
epoch
helvetius
who
combated
the
dogma
of
the
spagyrics
received
from
another
unknown
a
powder
of
projection
with
which
he
converted
an
ingot
of
lead
into
gold
helvetius
was
not
precisely
a
charlatan
neither
was
spinoza
who
verified
the
experiment
a
credulous
simpleton
and
what
is
to
be
thought
of
that
mysterious
man
alexander
sethon
who
under
the
name
of
the
cosmopolite
went
all
over
europe
operating
before
princes
in
public
transforming
all
metals
into
gold
this
alchemist
who
seems
to
have
had
a
sincere
disdain
for
riches
as
he
never
kept
the
gold
which
he
created
but
lived
in
poverty
and
prayer
was
imprisoned
by
christian
ii
elector
of
saxony
and
endured
martyrdom
like
a
saint
he
suffered
himself
to
be
beaten
with
rods
and
pierced
with
pointed
stakes
and
he
refused
to
give
up
a
secret
which
he
claimed
like
nicolas
flamel
to
have
received
from
god
and
to
think
that
these
researches
are
being
carried
on
at
the
present
time
only
most
of
the
hermetics
now
deny
medical
and
divine
virtues
to
the
famous
stone
they
think
simply
that
the
grand
magisterium
is
a
ferment
which
thrown
into
metals
in
fusion
produces
a
molecular
transformation
similar
to
that
which
organic
matter
undergoes
when
fermented
with
the
aid
of
a
leaven
des
hermies
who
is
well
acquainted
with
the
underworld
of
science
maintains
that
more
than
forty
alchemic
furnaces
are
now
alight
in
france
and
that
in
hanover
and
bavaria
the
adepts
are
more
numerous
yet
have
they
rediscovered
the
incomparable
secret
of
antiquity
in
spite
of
certain
affirmations
it
is
hardly
probable
nobody
need
manufacture
artificially
a
metal
whose
origins
are
so
unaccountable
that
a
deposit
is
likely
to
be
found
anywhere
for
instance
in
a
law
suit
which
took
place
at
paris
in
the
month
of
november
between
popp
constructor
of
pneumatic
city
clocks
and
financiers
who
had
been
backing
him
certain
engineers
and
chemists
of
the
school
of
mines
declared
that
gold
could
be
extracted
from
common
silex
so
that
the
very
walls
sheltering
us
might
be
placers
and
the
mansards
might
be
loaded
with
nuggets
at
any
rate
he
continued
smiling
these
sciences
are
not
propitious
he
was
thinking
of
an
old
man
who
had
installed
an
alchemic
laboratory
on
the
fifth
floor
of
a
house
in
the
rue
saint
jacques
this
man
named
auguste
redoutez
went
every
afternoon
to
the
bibliothèque
nationale
and
pored
over
the
works
of
nicolas
flamel
morning
and
evening
he
pursued
the
quest
of
the
great
work
in
front
of
his
furnace
the
of
march
the
year
before
he
came
out
of
the
bibliothèque
with
a
man
who
had
been
sitting
at
the
same
table
with
him
and
as
they
walked
along
together
redoutez
declared
that
he
was
finally
in
possession
of
the
famous
secret
arriving
in
his
laboratory
he
threw
pieces
of
iron
into
a
retort
made
a
projection
and
obtained
crystals
the
colour
of
blood
the
other
examined
the
salts
and
made
a
flippant
remark
the
alchemist
furious
threw
himself
upon
him
struck
him
with
a
hammer
and
had
to
be
overpowered
and
carried
in
a
to
saint
anne
pending
investigation
in
the
sixteenth
century
in
luxemburg
initiates
were
roasted
in
iron
cages
the
following
century
in
germany
they
were
clothed
in
rags
and
hanged
on
gilded
gibbets
now
that
they
are
tolerated
and
left
in
peace
they
go
mad
decidedly
fate
is
against
them
durtal
concluded
he
rose
and
went
to
answer
a
ring
at
the
door
he
came
back
with
a
letter
which
the
concierge
had
brought
he
opened
it
why
what
is
this
he
exclaimed
his
astonishment
grew
as
he
read
monsieur
i
am
neither
an
adventuress
nor
a
seeker
of
adventures
nor
am
i
a
society
woman
grown
weary
of
conversation
even
less
am
i
moved
by
the
vulgar
curiosity
to
find
out
whether
an
author
is
the
same
in
the
flesh
as
he
is
in
his
books
indeed
i
am
none
of
the
things
which
you
may
think
i
am
from
my
writing
to
you
this
way
the
fact
is
that
i
have
just
finished
reading
your
last
book
she
has
taken
her
time
murmured
durtal
it
appeared
a
year
ago
melancholy
as
an
imprisoned
soul
vainly
beating
its
wings
against
the
bars
of
its
cage
oh
hell
what
a
compliment
anyway
it
rings
false
like
all
of
them
and
now
monsieur
though
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
always
folly
and
madness
to
try
to
realize
a
desire
will
you
permit
that
a
sister
in
lassitude
meet
you
some
evening
in
a
place
which
you
shall
designate
after
which
we
shall
return
each
of
us
into
our
own
interior
the
interior
of
persons
destined
to
fall
because
they
are
out
of
line
with
their
adieu
monsieur
be
assured
that
i
consider
you
a
somebody
in
a
century
of
nobodies
not
knowing
whether
this
note
will
elicit
a
reply
i
abstain
from
making
myself
known
this
evening
a
maid
will
call
upon
your
concierge
and
ask
him
if
there
is
a
letter
for
mme
maubel
hmm
said
durtal
folding
up
the
letter
i
know
her
she
must
be
one
of
these
withered
dames
who
are
always
trying
to
cash
outlawed
and
in
the
lottery
of
love
years
old
at
least
her
is
composed
of
boys
who
are
always
satisfied
if
they
do
have
to
pay
and
men
of
letters
who
are
yet
more
easily
satisfied
for
the
ugliness
of
authors
mistresses
is
proverbial
unless
this
is
simply
a
practical
joke
but
who
would
be
playing
one
on
me
i
do
know
anybody
and
why
in
any
case
he
would
simply
not
reply
but
in
spite
of
himself
he
reopened
the
letter
well
now
what
do
i
risk
if
this
woman
wants
to
sell
me
an
heart
there
is
nothing
forcing
me
to
purchase
it
i
do
commit
myself
to
anything
by
going
to
an
assignation
but
where
shall
i
meet
her
here
no
once
she
gets
into
my
apartment
complications
arise
for
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
throw
a
woman
out
of
your
house
than
simply
to
walk
off
and
leave
her
at
a
street
corner
suppose
i
designated
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
sèvres
and
the
rue
de
la
chaise
under
the
wall
of
the
it
is
solitary
and
then
too
it
is
only
a
walk
from
here
or
no
i
will
begin
vaguely
naming
no
at
all
i
shall
solve
that
problem
later
when
i
get
her
reply
he
wrote
a
letter
in
which
he
spoke
of
his
own
spiritual
lassitude
and
declared
that
no
good
could
come
of
an
interview
for
he
no
longer
sought
happiness
on
earth
i
will
add
that
i
am
in
poor
health
that
is
always
a
good
one
and
it
excuses
a
man
from
a
man
if
necessary
he
said
to
himself
rolling
a
cigarette
well
that
done
and
she
wo
get
much
encouragement
out
of
it
oh
wait
i
omitted
something
to
keep
from
giving
her
a
hold
on
me
i
shall
do
well
to
let
her
know
that
a
serious
and
sustained
liaison
with
me
is
impossible
family
reasons
and
that
enough
for
one
time
he
folded
the
letter
and
scrawled
the
address
then
he
held
the
sealed
envelope
in
his
hand
and
reflected
of
course
i
am
a
fool
to
answer
her
who
knows
what
situations
a
thing
like
this
is
going
to
lead
to
i
am
well
aware
that
whoever
she
be
a
woman
is
an
incubator
of
sorrow
and
annoyance
if
she
is
good
she
is
probably
stupid
or
perhaps
she
is
an
invalid
or
perhaps
she
is
so
disastrously
fecund
that
she
gets
pregnant
if
you
look
at
her
if
she
is
bad
one
may
expect
to
be
dragged
through
every
disgusting
kind
of
degradation
oh
whatever
you
do
you
in
for
it
he
regurgitated
the
memories
of
his
youthful
amours
deception
disenchantment
how
pitilessly
base
a
woman
is
while
she
is
young
to
be
thinking
of
things
like
that
now
at
my
age
as
if
i
had
any
need
of
a
woman
now
but
in
spite
of
all
his
pseudonymous
correspondent
interested
him
who
knows
perhaps
she
is
or
at
least
not
very
it
does
cost
me
anything
to
find
out
he
her
letter
no
misspelling
the
handwriting
not
commercial
her
ideas
about
his
book
were
mediocre
enough
but
who
would
expect
her
to
be
a
critic
discreet
scent
of
heliotrope
he
added
sniffing
the
envelope
oh
well
let
have
our
little
fling
and
as
he
went
out
to
get
some
breakfast
he
left
his
reply
with
the
concierge
chapter
vii
if
this
continues
i
shall
lose
my
mind
murmured
durtal
as
he
sat
in
front
of
his
table
reperusing
the
letters
which
he
had
been
receiving
from
that
woman
for
the
last
week
she
was
an
indefatigable
and
since
she
had
begun
her
advances
he
had
not
had
time
to
answer
one
letter
before
another
arrived
my
he
said
let
try
and
see
just
where
we
do
stand
after
that
ungracious
answer
to
her
first
note
she
immediately
sends
me
this
is
a
farewell
if
i
were
weak
enough
to
write
you
any
more
letters
they
would
become
as
tedious
as
the
life
i
lead
anyway
have
i
not
had
the
best
part
of
you
in
that
hesitant
letter
of
yours
which
shook
me
out
of
my
lethargy
for
an
instant
like
yourself
monsieur
i
know
alas
that
nothing
happens
and
that
our
only
certain
joys
are
those
we
dream
of
so
in
spite
of
my
feverish
desire
to
know
you
i
fear
that
you
were
right
in
saying
that
a
meeting
would
be
for
both
of
us
the
source
of
regrets
to
which
we
ought
not
voluntarily
expose
ourselves
then
what
bears
witness
to
the
perfect
futility
of
this
exordium
is
the
way
the
missive
ends
you
should
take
the
fancy
to
write
me
you
can
safely
address
your
letters
mme
maubel
rue
littré
general
delivery
i
shall
be
passing
the
rue
littré
monday
if
you
wish
to
let
matters
remain
just
where
they
are
and
thus
cause
me
a
great
deal
of
pain
will
you
not
tell
me
so
frankly
whereupon
i
was
enough
to
compose
an
epistle
as
ambiguous
as
the
first
concealing
my
furtive
advances
under
an
apparent
reluctance
thus
letting
her
know
that
i
was
securely
hooked
as
her
third
note
proves
accuse
yourself
monsieur
i
repress
a
tenderer
name
which
rises
to
my
lips
of
being
unable
to
give
me
consolation
weary
disabused
as
we
are
and
done
with
it
all
let
us
sometimes
permit
our
souls
to
speak
to
each
other
low
very
low
as
i
have
spoken
to
you
this
night
for
henceforth
my
thought
is
going
to
follow
you
wherever
you
are
four
pages
of
the
same
tune
he
said
turning
the
leaves
but
this
is
better
my
unknown
friend
one
word
only
i
have
passed
a
horrible
day
my
nerves
in
revolt
and
crying
out
against
the
petty
sufferings
they
are
subjected
to
every
minute
a
slamming
door
a
harsh
or
squeaky
voice
floating
up
to
me
out
of
the
street
yet
there
are
whole
hours
when
i
am
so
far
from
being
sensitive
that
if
the
house
were
burning
i
should
not
move
am
i
about
to
send
you
a
page
of
comic
lamentations
ah
when
one
has
not
the
gift
of
rendering
one
grief
superbly
and
transforming
it
into
literary
or
musical
passages
which
weep
magnificently
the
best
thing
is
to
keep
still
about
it
bid
you
a
silent
goodnight
as
on
the
first
day
i
am
harassed
by
the
conflict
of
the
desire
to
see
you
and
the
dread
of
touching
a
dream
lest
it
perish
ah
yes
you
spoke
truly
miserable
miserable
wretches
that
we
are
our
timorous
souls
are
so
afraid
of
any
reality
that
they
dare
not
think
a
sympathy
which
has
taken
possession
of
them
capable
of
surviving
an
interview
with
the
person
who
gave
it
birth
yet
in
spite
of
this
fine
casuistry
i
simply
must
confess
to
you
no
no
nothing
guess
if
you
can
and
forgive
me
for
this
banal
letter
or
rather
read
between
the
lines
and
perhaps
you
will
find
there
a
little
bit
of
my
heart
and
a
great
deal
of
what
i
leave
unsaid
foolish
letter
with
i
written
all
over
it
who
would
suspect
that
while
i
wrote
it
my
sole
thought
was
of
you
so
far
so
good
this
woman
at
least
piqued
my
curiosity
and
what
peculiar
ink
he
thought
it
was
myrtle
green
very
thin
very
pale
with
his
he
detached
some
of
the
fine
dust
of
rice
powder
perfumed
with
heliotrope
clinging
to
the
seal
of
the
letters
she
must
be
blonde
he
went
on
examining
the
tint
of
the
powder
for
it
is
the
shade
that
brunettes
use
now
up
to
that
point
everything
had
been
going
nicely
but
then
and
there
i
spoiled
it
moved
by
i
know
not
what
folly
i
wrote
her
a
yet
more
roundabout
letter
which
however
was
very
pressing
in
attempting
to
fan
her
flame
i
kindled
myself
for
a
spectre
and
at
once
i
received
this
shall
i
do
i
neither
wish
to
see
you
nor
can
i
consent
to
annihilate
my
overwhelming
desire
to
meet
you
last
night
in
spite
of
me
your
name
which
was
burning
me
sprang
from
my
lips
my
husband
one
of
your
admirers
it
seems
appeared
to
be
somewhat
humiliated
by
the
preoccupation
which
indeed
was
absorbing
me
and
causing
unbearable
shivers
to
run
all
through
me
a
common
friend
of
yours
and
mine
for
why
should
i
not
tell
you
that
you
know
me
if
to
have
met
socially
is
to
know
anyone
one
of
your
friends
then
came
up
and
said
that
frankly
he
was
very
much
taken
with
you
i
was
in
a
state
of
such
utter
lack
of
that
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
had
it
not
been
for
the
unwitting
assistance
which
somebody
gave
me
by
pronouncing
the
name
of
a
grotesque
person
of
whom
i
can
never
think
without
laughing
adieu
you
are
right
i
tell
myself
that
i
will
never
write
you
again
and
i
go
and
do
it
anyway
own
as
i
can
not
be
in
reality
without
wounding
us
both
then
when
i
wrote
a
burning
reply
this
was
brought
by
a
maid
on
a
dead
run
if
i
were
not
afraid
afraid
and
you
know
you
are
just
as
much
afraid
as
i
am
how
i
should
fly
to
you
no
you
can
not
hear
the
thousand
conversations
with
which
my
soul
fatigues
yours
oh
in
my
miserable
existence
there
are
hours
when
madness
seizes
me
judge
for
yourself
the
whole
night
i
spent
appealing
to
you
furiously
i
wept
with
exasperation
this
morning
my
husband
came
into
the
room
my
eyes
were
bloodshot
i
began
to
laugh
crazily
and
when
i
could
speak
i
said
to
him
what
would
you
think
of
a
person
who
questioned
as
to
his
profession
replied
am
a
chamber
succubus
ah
my
dear
you
are
ill
said
he
worse
than
you
think
said
i
if
i
come
to
see
you
what
could
we
talk
about
in
the
state
you
yourself
are
in
your
letter
has
completely
unbalanced
me
you
arraign
your
malady
with
a
certain
brutality
which
makes
my
body
rejoice
but
alienates
my
soul
a
little
ah
what
if
our
dreams
could
really
come
true
say
a
word
just
one
word
from
out
your
own
heart
be
afraid
that
even
one
of
your
letters
can
possibly
fall
into
other
hands
than
mine
so
so
so
this
is
getting
to
be
no
laughing
matter
concluded
durtal
folding
up
the
letter
the
woman
is
married
to
a
man
who
knows
me
it
seems
what
a
situation
let
see
now
whom
have
i
ever
visited
he
tried
vainly
to
remember
no
woman
he
had
ever
met
at
an
evening
party
would
address
such
declarations
to
him
and
that
common
friend
but
i
have
no
friends
except
des
hermies
i
better
try
and
find
out
whom
he
has
been
seeing
recently
but
as
a
physician
he
meets
scores
of
people
and
then
how
can
i
explain
to
him
tell
him
the
story
he
will
burst
into
a
roar
and
disillusion
me
before
i
have
got
halfway
through
the
narrative
and
durtal
became
irritated
for
within
him
a
really
incomprehensible
phenomenon
was
taking
place
he
was
burning
for
this
unknown
woman
he
was
positively
obsessed
by
her
he
who
had
renounced
all
carnal
relations
years
ago
who
when
the
barns
of
his
senses
were
opened
contented
himself
with
driving
the
disgusting
herd
of
sin
to
the
commercial
shambles
to
be
summarily
knocked
in
the
head
by
the
butcher
girls
of
love
he
he
was
getting
himself
to
believe
in
the
teeth
of
all
experience
in
the
teeth
of
good
judgment
that
with
a
woman
as
passionate
as
this
one
seemed
to
be
he
would
experience
superhuman
sensations
and
novel
abandon
and
he
imagined
her
as
he
would
have
her
blonde
firm
of
flesh
lithe
feline
melancholy
capable
of
frenzies
and
the
picture
of
her
brought
on
such
a
tension
of
nerves
that
his
teeth
rattled
for
a
week
in
the
solitude
in
which
he
lived
he
had
dreamed
of
her
and
had
become
thoroughly
aroused
and
incapable
of
doing
any
work
even
of
reading
for
the
image
of
this
woman
interposed
itself
between
him
and
the
page
he
tried
suggesting
to
himself
ignoble
visions
he
would
imagine
this
creature
in
moments
of
corporal
distress
and
thus
calm
his
desires
with
unappetizing
hallucinations
but
the
procedure
which
had
formerly
been
very
effective
when
he
desired
a
woman
and
could
not
have
her
now
failed
utterly
he
somehow
could
not
imagine
his
unknown
in
quest
of
bismuth
or
of
linen
he
could
not
see
her
otherwise
than
rebellious
melancholy
dizzy
with
desire
kindling
him
with
her
eyes
inflaming
him
with
her
pale
hands
and
his
sensual
resurrection
was
incredible
an
aberrated
dog
star
flaming
in
a
physical
november
at
a
spiritual
all
hallows
tranquil
dried
up
safe
from
crises
without
veritable
desires
almost
impotent
or
rather
completely
forgetful
of
sex
for
months
at
a
time
he
was
suddenly
roused
and
for
an
unreality
by
the
mystery
of
mad
letters
enough
he
cried
smiting
the
table
a
jarring
blow
he
clapped
on
his
hat
and
went
out
slamming
the
door
behind
him
i
know
how
to
make
my
imagination
behave
and
he
rushed
over
to
the
latin
quarter
to
see
a
prostitute
he
knew
i
have
been
a
good
boy
too
long
he
murmured
as
he
hurried
down
the
street
one
ca
stay
on
the
straight
and
narrow
path
for
ever
he
found
the
woman
at
home
and
had
a
miserable
time
she
was
a
buxom
brunette
with
festive
eyes
and
the
teeth
of
a
wolf
an
expert
she
could
in
a
few
seconds
drain
one
marrow
granulate
the
lungs
and
demolish
the
loins
she
chid
him
for
having
been
away
so
long
then
cajoled
him
and
kissed
him
he
felt
pathetic
listless
out
of
breath
out
of
place
for
he
had
no
genuine
desires
he
finally
flung
himself
on
a
couch
and
enervated
to
the
point
of
crying
he
went
through
the
motions
mechanically
like
a
dredge
never
had
he
so
execrated
the
flesh
never
had
he
felt
such
repugnance
and
lassitude
as
when
he
issued
from
that
room
he
strolled
haphazard
down
the
rue
soufflot
and
the
image
of
the
unknown
obsessed
him
more
irritating
more
tenacious
i
begin
to
understand
the
superstition
of
the
succubus
i
must
try
some
tonight
i
will
swallow
a
gram
of
bromide
of
potassium
that
will
make
my
senses
be
good
but
he
realized
that
the
trouble
was
not
primarily
physical
that
really
it
was
only
the
consequence
of
an
extraordinary
state
of
mind
his
love
for
that
which
departed
from
the
formula
for
that
projection
of
the
which
had
recently
cheered
him
in
art
had
deviated
and
sought
expression
in
a
woman
she
embodied
his
need
to
soar
upward
from
the
terrestrial
humdrum
it
is
those
precious
unworldly
studies
those
cloister
thoughts
picturing
ecclesiastical
and
demoniac
scenes
which
have
prepared
me
for
the
present
folly
he
said
to
himself
his
unsuspected
and
hitherto
unexpressed
mysticism
which
had
determined
his
choice
of
subject
for
his
last
work
was
now
sending
him
out
in
disorder
to
seek
new
pains
and
pleasures
as
he
walked
along
he
recapitulated
what
he
knew
of
the
woman
she
was
married
blonde
in
easy
circumstances
because
she
had
her
own
sleeping
quarters
and
a
maid
she
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
because
she
went
to
the
rue
littré
for
her
mail
her
name
supposing
she
had
prefixed
her
own
initial
to
the
name
of
maubel
was
henriette
hortense
honorine
hubertine
or
hélène
what
else
she
must
frequent
the
society
of
artists
because
she
had
met
him
and
for
years
he
had
not
been
in
a
bourgeois
she
was
some
kind
of
a
morbid
catholic
because
that
word
succubus
was
unknown
to
the
profane
that
was
all
then
there
was
her
husband
who
gullible
as
he
might
be
must
nevertheless
suspect
their
liaison
since
by
her
own
confession
she
dissembled
her
obsession
very
badly
this
is
what
i
get
for
letting
myself
be
carried
away
for
i
too
wrote
at
first
to
amuse
myself
with
aphrodisiac
statements
then
i
ended
by
becoming
completely
hysterical
we
have
taken
turns
fanning
smouldering
ashes
which
now
are
blazing
it
is
too
bad
that
we
have
both
become
inflamed
at
the
same
time
for
her
case
must
be
the
same
as
mine
to
judge
from
the
passionate
letters
she
writes
what
shall
i
do
keep
on
tantalizing
myself
for
a
chimera
no
i
bring
matters
to
a
head
see
her
and
if
she
is
sleep
with
her
i
shall
have
peace
anyway
he
looked
about
him
without
knowing
how
he
had
got
there
he
found
himself
in
the
jardin
des
plantes
he
oriented
himself
remembered
that
there
was
a
café
on
the
side
facing
the
quay
and
went
to
find
it
he
tried
to
control
himself
and
write
a
letter
at
once
ardent
and
firm
but
the
pen
shook
in
his
fingers
he
wrote
at
a
gallop
confessed
that
he
regretted
not
having
consented
at
the
outset
to
the
meeting
she
proposed
and
attempting
to
check
himself
declared
we
must
see
each
other
think
of
the
harm
we
are
doing
ourselves
teasing
each
other
at
a
distance
think
of
the
remedy
we
have
at
hand
my
poor
darling
i
implore
you
he
must
indicate
a
place
of
meeting
he
hesitated
let
me
think
he
said
to
himself
i
do
want
her
to
alight
at
my
place
too
dangerous
then
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
offer
her
a
glass
of
port
and
a
biscuit
and
conduct
her
to
lavenue
which
is
a
hotel
as
well
as
a
café
i
will
reserve
a
room
that
will
be
less
disgusting
than
an
assignation
house
very
well
then
let
us
put
in
place
of
the
rue
de
la
chaise
the
of
the
gare
montparnasse
sometimes
it
is
quite
empty
well
that
done
he
gummed
the
envelope
and
felt
a
kind
of
relief
ah
i
was
forgetting
garçon
the
bottin
de
paris
he
searched
for
the
name
maubel
thinking
that
by
some
chance
it
might
be
her
own
of
course
it
was
hardly
probable
but
she
seemed
so
imprudent
that
with
her
anything
was
to
be
expected
he
might
very
easily
have
met
a
mme
maubel
and
forgotten
her
he
found
a
maubé
and
a
maubec
but
no
maubel
of
course
that
proves
nothing
he
said
closing
the
directory
he
went
out
and
threw
his
letter
into
the
box
the
joker
in
this
is
the
husband
but
hell
i
am
not
likely
to
take
his
wife
away
from
him
very
long
he
had
an
idea
of
going
home
but
he
realized
that
he
would
do
no
work
that
alone
he
would
relapse
into
daydream
if
i
went
up
to
des
hermies
place
yes
today
was
his
consultation
day
it
an
idea
he
quickened
his
pace
came
to
the
rue
madame
and
rang
at
an
entresol
the
housekeeper
opened
the
door
ah
monsieur
durtal
he
is
out
but
he
will
be
in
soon
will
you
wait
but
you
are
sure
he
is
coming
back
why
yes
he
ought
to
be
here
now
she
said
stirring
the
fire
as
soon
as
she
had
retired
durtal
sat
down
then
becoming
bored
he
went
over
and
began
browsing
among
the
books
which
covered
the
wall
as
in
his
own
place
des
hermies
certainly
has
some
curious
items
he
murmured
opening
a
very
old
book
here
a
treatise
written
centuries
ago
to
suit
my
case
exactly
well
i
be
damned
it
a
plantin
and
what
does
this
manual
have
to
recommend
in
the
treatment
of
the
possessed
hmmm
contains
some
quaint
here
are
some
for
energumens
for
the
bewitched
here
are
some
against
and
against
the
plague
against
spells
cast
on
comestibles
some
even
to
keep
butter
and
milk
sweet
that
is
odd
the
devil
entered
into
everything
in
the
good
old
days
and
what
can
this
be
in
his
hand
he
held
two
little
volumes
with
crimson
edges
bound
in
calf
he
opened
them
and
looked
at
the
title
anatomy
of
the
by
pierre
du
moulin
dated
geneva
might
prove
interesting
he
went
to
warm
his
feet
and
hastily
skimmed
through
one
of
the
volumes
why
he
said
it
mighty
good
on
the
page
which
he
was
reading
was
a
discussion
of
the
priesthood
the
author
affirmed
that
none
might
exercise
the
functions
of
the
priesthood
if
he
was
not
sound
in
body
or
if
any
of
his
members
had
been
amputated
and
asking
apropos
of
this
if
a
castrated
man
could
be
ordained
a
priest
he
answered
his
own
question
no
unless
he
carries
upon
him
reduced
to
powder
the
parts
which
are
wanting
he
added
however
that
cardinal
tolet
did
not
admit
this
interpretation
which
nevertheless
had
been
universally
adopted
durtal
amused
read
on
now
du
moulin
was
debating
with
himself
the
point
whether
it
was
necessary
to
interdict
abbés
ravaged
by
lechery
and
in
answer
he
cited
himself
the
melancholy
glose
of
canon
maximianus
who
in
his
distinction
sighs
it
is
commonly
said
that
none
ought
to
be
deposed
from
his
charge
for
fornication
in
view
of
the
fact
that
few
can
be
found
exempt
from
this
vice
why
you
here
said
des
hermies
entering
what
are
you
reading
anatomy
of
the
mass
oh
it
a
poor
thing
for
protestants
i
am
just
about
distracted
oh
my
friend
what
brutes
those
people
are
and
like
a
man
with
a
great
weight
on
his
chest
he
unburdened
himself
yes
i
have
just
come
from
a
consultation
with
those
whom
the
journals
characterize
as
of
science
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
have
had
to
listen
to
the
most
contradictory
opinions
on
one
point
however
all
agreed
that
my
patient
was
a
dead
man
finally
they
compromised
and
decided
that
the
poor
wretch
torture
should
be
needlessly
prolonged
by
a
course
of
moxas
i
timidly
remarked
that
it
would
be
simpler
to
send
for
a
confessor
and
then
assuage
the
sufferings
of
the
dying
man
with
repeated
injections
of
morphine
if
you
had
seen
their
faces
they
came
as
near
as
anything
to
denouncing
me
as
a
tout
for
the
priests
and
such
is
contemporary
science
everybody
discovers
a
new
or
forgotten
disease
and
trumpets
a
forgotten
or
a
new
remedy
and
nobody
knows
a
thing
and
then
too
what
good
does
it
do
one
not
to
be
hopelessly
ignorant
since
there
is
so
much
sophistication
going
on
in
pharmacy
that
no
physician
can
be
sure
of
having
his
prescriptions
filled
to
the
letter
one
example
among
many
at
present
sirup
of
white
poppy
the
diacodia
of
the
old
codex
does
not
exist
it
is
manufactured
with
laudanum
and
sirup
of
sugar
as
if
they
were
the
same
thing
we
have
got
so
we
no
longer
dose
substances
but
prescribe
remedies
and
use
those
surprising
specifics
which
fill
up
the
fourth
pages
of
the
journals
it
a
compromise
medicine
a
democratic
medicine
one
cure
for
all
cases
it
scandalous
it
silly
no
there
is
no
use
in
talking
the
old
therapeutics
based
on
experience
was
better
than
this
at
least
it
know
that
remedies
ingested
in
pill
powder
or
bolus
form
were
treacherous
so
it
prescribed
them
only
in
the
liquid
state
now
too
every
physician
specializes
the
oculists
see
only
the
eyes
and
to
cure
them
quite
calmly
poison
the
body
with
their
pilocarpine
they
have
ruined
the
health
of
how
many
people
for
ever
others
treat
cutaneous
affections
they
drive
an
eczema
inward
on
an
old
man
who
as
soon
as
he
is
becomes
childish
or
dangerous
there
is
no
more
solidarity
allegiance
to
one
party
means
hostility
to
all
others
its
a
mess
now
my
honourable
confrères
are
stumbling
around
taking
a
fancy
to
medicaments
which
they
do
even
know
how
to
use
take
antipyrine
for
example
it
is
one
of
the
very
few
really
active
products
that
the
chemists
have
found
in
a
long
time
well
where
is
the
doctor
who
knows
that
applied
in
a
compress
with
iodide
and
cold
bondonneau
spring
water
antipyrine
combats
the
supposedly
incurable
ailment
cancer
and
if
that
seems
incredible
it
is
true
nevertheless
honestly
said
durtal
you
believe
that
the
doctors
came
nearer
healing
yes
because
miraculously
they
know
the
effects
of
certain
invariable
remedies
prepared
without
fraud
of
course
it
is
that
when
old
paré
eulogized
medicine
and
ordered
his
patients
to
carry
pulverized
medicaments
in
a
little
sack
whose
form
varied
according
to
the
organ
to
be
healed
assuming
the
form
of
a
cap
for
the
head
of
a
bagpipe
for
the
stomach
of
an
ox
tongue
for
the
spleen
he
probably
did
not
obtain
very
signal
results
his
claim
to
have
cured
gastralgia
by
appositions
of
powder
of
red
rose
coral
and
mastic
wormwood
and
mint
aniseed
and
nutmeg
is
certainly
not
to
be
borne
out
but
he
also
had
other
systems
and
often
he
cured
because
he
possessed
the
science
of
simples
which
is
now
lost
the
physicians
shrug
their
shoulders
when
the
name
of
ambrose
paré
is
mentioned
they
used
to
the
idea
of
the
alchemists
that
gold
had
medicinal
virtue
their
fine
scorn
does
not
now
prevent
them
from
using
alternate
doses
of
the
salts
and
of
the
filings
of
this
metal
they
use
concentrated
arseniate
of
gold
against
anemia
muriate
against
syphilis
cyanide
against
amenorrhea
and
scrofula
and
chloride
of
sodium
and
gold
against
old
ulcers
no
i
assure
you
it
is
disgusting
to
be
a
physician
for
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
am
a
doctor
of
science
and
have
extensive
hospital
experience
i
am
quite
inferior
to
humble
country
herborists
solitaries
who
know
a
great
deal
more
than
i
about
what
is
useful
to
know
and
i
admit
it
and
homeopathy
it
has
some
good
things
about
it
and
some
bad
ones
it
also
palliates
without
curing
it
sometimes
represses
maladies
but
for
grave
and
acute
cases
it
is
impotent
just
like
this
mattei
system
which
however
is
useful
as
an
intermediary
to
stave
off
a
crisis
with
its
products
its
antiscrofoloso
its
angiotico
its
it
sometimes
modifies
morbid
states
in
which
other
methods
are
of
no
avail
for
instance
it
permits
a
patient
whose
kidneys
have
been
demoralized
by
iodide
of
potassium
to
gain
time
and
recuperate
so
that
he
can
safely
begin
to
drink
iodide
again
i
add
that
terrific
shooting
pains
which
rebel
even
against
chloroform
and
morphine
often
yield
to
an
application
of
electricity
you
ask
me
perhaps
of
what
ingredients
this
liquid
electricity
is
made
i
answer
that
i
know
absolutely
nothing
about
it
mattei
claims
that
he
has
been
able
to
fix
in
his
globules
and
liquors
the
electrical
properties
of
certain
plants
but
he
has
never
given
out
his
recipe
hence
he
can
tell
whatever
stories
suit
him
what
is
curious
anyway
is
that
this
system
thought
out
by
a
roman
count
a
catholic
has
its
most
important
following
and
propaganda
among
protestant
pastors
whose
original
asininity
becomes
abysmal
in
the
unbelievable
homilies
which
accompany
their
essays
on
healing
indeed
considered
seriously
these
systems
are
a
lot
of
wind
the
truth
is
that
in
the
art
of
healing
we
grope
along
at
hazard
nevertheless
with
a
little
experience
and
a
great
deal
of
nerve
we
can
manage
so
as
not
too
shockingly
to
depopulate
the
cities
enough
of
that
old
man
and
now
where
have
you
been
keeping
yourself
just
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
you
have
been
to
see
me
for
over
a
week
well
just
now
everybody
in
the
world
is
ill
and
i
am
racing
around
all
the
time
by
the
way
i
been
attending
chantelouve
who
has
a
pretty
serious
attack
of
gout
he
complains
of
your
absence
and
his
wife
whom
i
should
not
have
taken
for
an
admirer
of
your
books
of
your
last
novel
especially
speaks
to
me
unceasingly
of
them
and
you
for
a
person
customarily
so
reserved
she
seems
to
me
to
have
become
quite
enthusiastic
about
you
does
mme
chantelouve
why
what
the
matter
he
exclaimed
seeing
how
red
durtal
had
become
oh
nothing
but
i
got
to
be
going
good
night
why
are
you
feeling
well
oh
it
nothing
i
assure
you
oh
well
said
des
hermies
knowing
better
than
to
insist
look
at
this
and
took
him
into
the
kitchen
and
showed
him
a
superb
leg
of
mutton
hanging
beside
the
window
i
hung
it
up
in
a
draft
so
as
to
get
some
of
the
crass
freshness
out
of
it
we
eat
it
when
we
have
the
astrologer
gévingey
to
dine
with
us
at
carhaix
as
i
am
the
only
person
alive
who
knows
how
to
boil
a
à
i
am
going
to
be
the
cook
so
i
sha
come
by
for
you
you
will
find
me
in
the
tower
disguised
as
a
scullery
maid
once
outside
durtal
took
a
long
breath
well
well
his
unknown
was
chantelouve
wife
impossible
she
had
never
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
him
she
was
silent
and
cold
impossible
and
yet
why
had
she
spoken
that
way
to
des
hermies
but
surely
if
she
had
wanted
to
see
him
she
would
have
come
to
his
apartment
since
they
were
acquaintances
she
would
not
have
started
this
correspondence
under
a
pseudonym
de
maubel
he
said
suddenly
why
mme
chantelouve
name
is
hyacinthe
a
boy
name
which
suits
her
very
well
she
lives
in
the
rue
babneux
not
vary
far
from
the
rue
littré
she
is
a
blonde
she
has
a
maid
she
is
a
fervent
catholic
she
the
one
and
he
experienced
almost
simultaneously
two
absolutely
distinct
sensations
of
disappointment
first
for
his
unknown
pleased
him
better
mme
chantelouve
would
never
realize
the
ideal
he
had
fashioned
for
himself
the
tantalizing
features
the
agile
wild
animal
body
the
melancholy
and
ardent
bearing
which
he
had
dreamed
indeed
the
mere
fact
of
knowing
the
unknown
rendered
her
less
desirable
more
vulgar
accessibility
killed
the
chimera
at
the
same
time
he
experienced
a
lively
relief
he
might
have
been
dealing
with
a
hideous
old
crone
and
hyacinthe
as
he
immediately
began
to
call
her
was
desirable
at
most
not
pretty
but
peculiar
blonde
slight
and
supple
with
no
hips
she
seemed
thin
because
she
was
the
face
mediocre
spoiled
by
too
big
a
nose
but
the
lips
incandescent
the
teeth
superb
her
complexion
ever
so
faint
a
rose
in
the
slightly
bluish
milk
white
of
rice
water
a
little
troubled
then
her
real
charm
the
really
deceptive
enigma
of
her
was
in
her
eyes
eyes
which
seemed
uncertain
myopic
and
which
conveyed
an
expression
of
resigned
boredom
at
certain
moments
the
pupils
glowed
like
a
gem
of
grey
water
and
sparks
of
silver
twinkled
to
the
surface
by
turns
they
were
dolent
forsaken
languorous
and
haughty
he
remembered
that
those
eyes
had
often
brought
his
heart
into
his
throat
in
spite
of
circumstantial
evidence
he
reflected
that
those
impassioned
letters
did
not
correspond
in
any
way
to
this
woman
in
the
flesh
never
was
woman
more
controlled
more
adept
in
the
lies
of
good
breeding
he
remembered
the
chantelouve
she
seemed
attentive
made
no
contribution
to
the
conversation
played
the
hostess
smiling
without
animation
it
was
a
kind
of
case
of
dual
personality
in
one
visible
phase
a
society
woman
prudent
and
reserved
in
another
concealed
phase
a
wild
romantic
mad
with
passion
hysterical
of
body
nymphomaniac
of
soul
it
hardly
seemed
probable
no
he
said
i
am
on
the
wrong
track
it
merely
by
chance
that
mme
chantelouve
spoke
of
my
books
to
des
hermies
and
i
must
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
she
is
smitten
with
me
and
that
she
has
been
writing
me
these
hot
letters
it
is
she
but
who
on
earth
is
it
he
continued
to
revolve
the
question
without
coming
any
nearer
a
solution
again
he
called
before
his
eyes
the
image
of
this
woman
and
admitted
that
she
was
really
potently
seductive
with
a
fresh
girlish
body
flexible
and
without
a
lot
of
repugnant
flesh
and
mysterious
with
her
concentrated
air
her
plaintive
eyes
and
even
her
coldness
real
or
feigned
he
summarized
all
that
he
really
knew
about
her
simply
that
she
was
a
widow
when
she
married
chantelouve
that
she
had
no
children
that
her
first
husband
a
manufacturer
of
chasubles
had
for
unknown
reasons
committed
suicide
that
was
all
on
the
other
hand
too
too
much
was
known
about
chantelouve
author
of
a
history
of
poland
and
the
cabinets
of
the
north
of
a
history
of
boniface
viii
and
his
times
a
life
of
the
blessed
jeanne
de
valois
founder
of
the
annonciade
a
biography
of
the
venerable
mother
anne
de
xaintonge
teacher
of
the
company
of
saint
ursula
and
other
books
of
the
same
kind
published
by
lecoffre
palmé
poussielgue
in
the
inevitable
shagreen
or
sheep
bindings
stamped
with
dendriform
patterns
chantelouve
was
preparing
his
candidacy
for
the
académie
des
inscriptions
et
and
hoped
for
the
support
of
the
party
of
the
ducs
that
was
why
he
received
influential
hypocrites
provincial
tartufes
and
priests
every
week
he
doubtless
had
to
drive
himself
to
do
this
because
in
spite
of
his
slinking
slyness
he
was
jovial
and
enjoyed
a
joke
on
the
other
hand
he
aspired
to
figure
in
the
literature
that
counts
at
paris
and
he
expended
a
good
deal
of
ingenuity
inveigling
men
of
letters
to
his
house
on
another
evening
every
week
to
make
them
his
aides
or
at
least
keep
them
from
openly
attacking
him
so
soon
as
his
candidacy
an
entirely
clerical
affair
should
be
announced
it
was
probably
to
attract
and
placate
his
adversaries
that
he
had
contrived
these
baroque
gatherings
to
which
out
of
curiosity
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
most
utterly
different
kinds
of
people
came
he
had
other
motives
it
was
said
that
he
had
no
scruples
about
exploiting
his
social
acquaintances
durtal
had
even
noticed
that
at
each
of
the
dinners
given
by
chantelouve
a
stranger
was
present
and
the
rumour
went
about
that
this
guest
was
a
wealthy
provincial
to
whom
men
of
letters
were
exhibited
like
a
collection
and
from
whom
before
or
afterward
important
sums
were
borrowed
it
is
undeniable
that
the
chantelouves
have
no
income
and
that
they
live
in
style
catholic
publishing
houses
and
magazines
pay
even
worse
than
the
secular
so
in
spite
of
his
established
reputation
in
the
clerical
world
chantelouve
can
not
possibly
maintain
such
a
standard
of
living
on
his
royalties
there
simply
is
no
telling
what
these
people
are
up
to
that
this
woman
home
life
is
unhappy
and
that
she
does
not
love
the
sneaky
sacristan
to
whom
she
is
married
is
quite
possible
but
what
is
her
real
rôle
in
that
household
is
she
accessory
to
chantelouve
pecuniary
dodges
if
that
is
the
case
i
do
see
why
she
should
pick
on
me
if
she
is
in
connivance
with
her
husband
she
certainly
ought
to
have
sense
enough
to
seek
an
influential
or
wealthy
lover
and
she
is
perfectly
aware
that
i
fulfil
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
condition
chantelouve
knows
very
well
that
i
am
incapable
of
paying
for
her
gowns
and
thus
contributing
to
the
upkeep
of
their
establishment
i
make
about
three
thousand
livres
and
i
can
hardly
contrive
to
keep
myself
going
so
that
is
not
her
game
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
their
kind
of
people
he
concluded
somewhat
chilled
by
these
reflections
but
i
am
a
big
fool
what
i
know
about
them
proves
that
my
unknown
beloved
is
not
chantelouve
wife
and
all
things
considered
i
am
glad
she
is
chapter
viii
next
day
his
ferment
had
subsided
the
unknown
never
left
him
but
she
kept
her
distance
her
less
certain
features
were
effaced
in
mist
her
fascination
became
feebler
and
she
no
longer
was
his
sole
preoccupation
the
idea
suddenly
formed
on
a
word
of
des
hermies
that
the
unknown
must
be
chantelouve
wife
had
in
fashion
checked
his
fever
if
it
was
she
and
his
contrary
conclusions
of
the
evening
before
seemed
hardly
valid
when
he
took
up
one
by
one
the
arguments
by
which
he
had
arrived
at
them
then
her
reasons
for
wanting
him
were
obscure
dangerous
and
he
was
on
his
guard
no
longer
letting
himself
go
in
complete
and
yet
there
was
another
phenomenon
taking
place
within
him
he
had
never
paid
any
especial
attention
to
hyacinthe
chantelouve
he
had
never
been
in
love
with
her
she
interested
him
by
the
mystery
of
her
person
and
her
life
but
outside
her
he
had
never
given
her
a
thought
now
ruminating
about
her
he
began
almost
to
desire
her
suddenly
she
benefited
by
the
face
of
the
unknown
for
when
durtal
evoked
her
she
came
confused
to
his
sight
her
physiognomy
mingled
with
that
which
he
had
visualized
when
the
first
letters
came
though
the
sneaking
scoundrelism
of
her
husband
displeased
him
he
did
not
think
her
the
less
attractive
but
his
desires
were
no
longer
beyond
control
in
spite
of
the
distrust
which
she
aroused
she
might
be
an
interesting
mistress
making
up
for
her
barefaced
vices
by
her
good
grace
but
she
was
no
longer
the
the
chimera
raised
in
a
moment
of
uncertainty
on
the
other
hand
if
his
conjectures
were
false
if
it
was
not
mme
chantelouve
who
had
written
the
letters
then
the
other
the
unknown
lost
a
little
of
her
subtlety
by
the
mere
fact
that
she
could
be
incarnated
in
a
creature
whom
he
knew
still
remote
she
became
less
so
then
her
beauty
deteriorated
because
in
turn
she
took
on
certain
features
of
mme
chantelouve
and
if
the
latter
had
profited
the
former
on
the
contrary
lost
by
the
confusion
which
durtal
had
established
in
one
as
in
the
other
case
whether
she
were
mme
chantelouve
or
not
he
felt
appeased
calmed
at
heart
he
did
not
know
when
he
revolved
the
adventure
whether
he
preferred
his
chimera
even
diminished
or
this
hyacinthe
who
at
least
in
her
reality
was
not
a
disenchanting
frump
wrinkled
with
age
he
profited
by
the
respite
to
get
back
to
work
but
he
had
presumed
too
much
upon
his
powers
when
he
tried
to
begin
his
chapter
on
the
crimes
of
gilles
de
rais
he
discovered
that
he
was
incapable
of
sewing
two
sentences
together
he
wandered
in
pursuit
of
the
marshal
and
caught
up
with
him
but
the
prose
in
which
he
wished
to
embody
the
man
remained
listless
and
lifeless
and
he
could
think
only
patchily
he
threw
down
his
pen
and
sank
into
an
armchair
in
revery
he
was
transported
to
tiffauges
where
satan
who
had
refused
so
obstinately
to
show
himself
now
became
incarnate
in
the
unwitting
marshal
to
wallow
him
vociferating
in
the
joys
of
murder
for
this
basically
is
what
satanism
is
said
durtal
to
himself
the
external
semblance
of
the
demon
is
a
minor
matter
he
has
no
need
of
exhibiting
himself
in
human
or
bestial
form
to
attest
his
presence
for
him
to
prove
himself
it
is
enough
that
he
choose
a
domicile
in
souls
which
he
ulcerates
and
incites
to
inexplicable
crimes
then
he
can
hold
his
victims
by
that
hope
which
he
breathes
into
them
that
instead
of
living
in
them
as
he
does
and
as
they
do
often
know
he
will
obey
evocations
appear
to
them
and
deal
out
duly
legally
the
advantages
he
concedes
in
exchange
for
certain
forfeits
our
very
willingness
to
make
a
pact
with
him
must
be
able
often
to
produce
his
infusion
into
us
all
the
modern
theories
of
the
followers
of
maudsley
and
lombroso
do
not
in
fact
render
the
singular
abuses
of
the
marshal
comprehensible
nothing
could
be
more
just
than
to
class
him
as
a
monomaniac
for
he
was
one
if
by
the
word
monomaniac
we
designate
every
man
who
is
dominated
by
a
fixed
idea
but
so
is
every
one
of
us
more
or
less
from
the
business
man
all
whose
thoughts
converge
on
the
one
idea
of
gain
to
the
artist
absorbed
in
bringing
his
masterpiece
into
the
world
but
why
was
the
marshal
a
monomaniac
how
did
he
become
one
that
is
what
all
the
lombrosos
in
the
world
ca
tell
you
encephalic
lesions
adherence
of
the
to
the
cerebrum
mean
absolutely
nothing
in
this
question
for
they
are
simple
resultants
effects
derived
from
a
cause
which
ought
to
be
explained
and
which
no
materialist
can
explain
it
is
easy
to
declare
that
a
disturbance
of
the
cerebral
lobes
produces
assassins
and
demonomaniacs
the
famous
alienists
of
our
time
claim
that
analysis
of
the
brain
of
an
insane
woman
disclosed
a
lesion
or
a
deterioration
of
the
grey
matter
and
suppose
it
did
it
would
still
be
a
question
whether
in
the
case
of
a
woman
possessed
with
demonomania
the
lesion
produced
the
demonomania
or
the
demonomania
produced
the
lesion
admitting
that
there
was
a
lesion
the
spiritual
comprachicos
have
never
resorted
to
cerebral
surgery
they
do
amputate
the
lobes
supposed
to
be
reliably
identified
after
carefully
trepanning
they
simply
act
upon
the
pupil
by
inculcating
ignoble
ideas
in
him
developing
his
bad
instincts
pushing
him
little
by
little
into
the
paths
of
vice
and
if
this
gymnastic
of
persuasion
deteriorates
the
cerebral
tissues
in
the
subject
that
proves
precisely
that
the
lesion
is
only
the
derivative
and
not
the
cause
of
the
psychological
state
and
then
and
then
these
doctrines
which
consist
nowadays
in
confounding
the
criminal
with
the
insane
the
demonomaniac
with
the
mad
have
absolutely
no
foundation
nine
years
ago
a
lad
of
fourteen
felix
lemaîre
assassinated
a
little
boy
whom
he
did
not
know
he
just
wanted
to
see
the
child
suffer
just
wanted
to
hear
him
cry
felix
slashed
the
little
fellow
stomach
with
a
knife
turned
the
blade
round
and
round
in
the
warm
flesh
then
slowly
sawed
his
victim
head
off
felix
manifested
no
remorse
and
in
the
ensuing
investigation
proved
himself
to
be
intelligent
and
atrocious
legrand
du
saule
and
other
specialists
kept
him
under
vigilant
surveillance
for
months
and
could
not
discover
the
slightest
pathological
symptom
and
he
had
had
fairly
good
rearing
and
certainly
had
not
been
corrupted
by
others
his
behaviour
was
like
that
of
the
conscious
or
unconscious
demonomaniacs
who
do
evil
for
evil
sake
they
are
no
more
mad
than
the
rapt
monk
in
his
cell
than
the
man
who
does
good
for
good
sake
anybody
but
a
medical
theorist
can
see
that
the
desire
for
good
and
the
desire
for
evil
simply
form
the
two
opposing
poles
of
the
soul
in
the
fifteenth
century
these
extremes
were
represented
by
jeanne
and
the
marshal
de
rais
now
there
is
no
more
reason
for
attributing
madness
to
gilles
than
there
is
for
attributing
it
to
jeanne
whose
admirable
excesses
certainly
have
no
connection
with
vesania
and
delirium
all
the
same
some
frightful
nights
must
have
been
passed
in
that
fortress
said
durtal
he
was
thinking
of
the
château
de
tiffauges
which
he
had
visited
a
year
ago
believing
that
it
would
aid
him
in
his
work
to
live
in
the
country
where
gilles
had
lived
and
to
dig
among
the
ruins
he
had
established
himself
in
the
little
hamlet
which
stretches
along
the
base
of
the
abandoned
donjon
he
learned
what
a
living
thing
the
legend
of
bluebeard
was
in
this
isolated
part
of
la
vendée
on
the
border
of
brittany
he
was
a
young
man
who
came
to
a
bad
end
said
the
young
women
more
fearful
their
grandmothers
crossed
themselves
as
they
went
along
the
foot
of
the
wall
in
the
evening
the
memory
of
the
disembowelled
children
persisted
the
marshal
known
only
by
his
surname
still
had
power
to
terrify
durtal
had
gone
every
day
from
the
inn
where
he
lodged
to
the
château
towering
over
the
valleys
of
the
crume
and
of
the
sèvre
facing
hills
excoriated
with
blocks
of
granite
and
overgrown
with
formidable
oaks
whose
roots
protruding
out
of
the
ground
resembled
monstrous
nests
of
frightened
snakes
one
might
have
believed
oneself
transported
into
the
real
brittany
there
was
the
same
melancholy
heavy
sky
the
same
sun
which
seemed
older
than
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
which
but
feebly
gilded
the
sorrowful
forests
and
the
mossy
sandstone
there
were
the
same
endless
stretches
of
broken
rocky
soil
pitted
with
ponds
of
rusty
water
dotted
with
scattered
clumps
of
gorse
and
fruze
copse
and
sprinkled
with
pink
harebells
and
nameless
yellow
prairie
flowers
one
felt
that
this
sky
this
starving
soil
empurpled
only
here
and
there
by
the
bleeding
flower
of
the
buckwheat
that
these
roads
bordered
with
stones
placed
one
on
top
of
the
other
without
cement
or
plaster
that
these
paths
bordered
with
impenetrable
hedges
that
these
grudging
plants
these
inhospitable
fields
these
crippled
beggars
eaten
with
vermin
plastered
with
filth
that
even
the
flocks
undersized
and
wasted
the
dumpy
little
cows
the
black
sheep
whose
blue
eyes
had
the
cold
pale
gleam
that
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
slav
or
of
the
tribade
had
perpetuated
their
primordial
state
preserving
an
identical
landscape
through
all
the
centuries
except
for
an
incongruous
factory
chimney
further
away
on
the
bank
of
the
sèvre
the
countryside
of
tiffauges
remained
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
immense
château
erect
among
its
ruins
within
the
close
still
to
be
traced
by
the
ruins
of
the
towers
was
a
whole
plain
now
converted
into
a
miserable
truck
garden
cabbages
in
long
bluish
lines
impoverished
carrots
consumptive
navews
spread
over
this
enormous
circle
where
iron
mail
had
clanked
in
the
tournament
and
where
processionals
had
slowly
devolved
in
the
smoke
of
incense
to
the
chanting
of
psalms
a
thatched
hut
had
been
built
in
a
corner
the
peasant
inhabitants
returned
to
a
state
of
savagery
no
longer
understood
the
meaning
of
words
and
could
be
roused
out
of
their
apathy
only
by
the
display
of
a
silver
coin
seizing
the
coin
they
would
hand
over
the
keys
for
hours
one
could
browse
around
at
ease
among
the
ruins
and
smoke
and
daydream
unfortunately
certain
parts
were
inaccessible
the
donjon
was
still
shut
off
on
the
tiffauges
side
by
a
vast
moat
at
the
bottom
of
which
mighty
trees
were
growing
one
would
have
had
to
pass
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
growing
to
the
very
verge
of
the
wall
to
gain
a
porch
on
the
other
side
for
there
was
now
no
drawbridge
but
quite
accessible
was
another
part
which
overhung
the
sèvre
there
the
wings
of
the
castle
overgrown
with
ivy
and
viburnum
were
intact
spongy
dry
as
pumice
stone
silvered
with
lichen
and
gilded
with
moss
the
towers
rose
entire
though
from
their
crenelated
collarettes
whole
blocks
were
blown
away
on
windy
nights
within
room
succeeded
glacial
room
cut
into
the
granite
surmounted
with
vaulted
roofs
and
as
close
as
the
hold
of
a
ship
then
by
spiral
stairways
one
descended
into
similar
chambers
joined
by
cellar
passageways
into
the
walls
of
which
were
dug
deep
niches
and
lairs
of
unknown
utility
beneath
those
corridors
so
narrow
that
two
persons
could
not
walk
along
them
abreast
descended
at
a
gentle
slope
and
bifurcated
so
that
there
was
a
labyrinth
of
lanes
leading
to
veritable
cells
on
the
walls
of
which
the
nitre
scintillated
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
like
steel
mica
or
twinkling
grains
of
sugar
in
the
cells
above
in
the
dungeons
beneath
one
stumbled
over
rifts
of
hard
earth
in
the
centre
or
in
a
corner
of
which
yawned
now
the
mouth
of
an
unsealed
oubliette
now
a
well
finally
at
the
summit
of
one
of
the
towers
that
at
the
left
as
one
entered
there
was
a
roofed
gallery
running
parallel
to
a
circular
foothold
cut
from
the
rock
there
without
doubt
the
had
been
stationed
to
fire
on
their
assailants
through
wide
loopholes
opening
overhead
and
underfoot
in
this
gallery
the
voice
even
the
lowest
followed
the
curving
walls
and
could
be
heard
all
around
the
circuit
briefly
the
exterior
of
the
castle
revealed
a
fortified
place
built
to
stand
long
sieges
and
the
dismantled
interior
made
one
think
of
a
prison
in
which
flesh
mildewed
by
the
moisture
must
rot
in
a
few
months
out
in
the
open
air
again
one
felt
a
sensation
of
of
relief
which
one
lost
on
traversing
the
ruins
of
the
isolated
chapel
and
penetrating
by
a
cellar
door
to
the
crypt
below
this
chapel
low
squat
its
vaulted
roof
upheld
by
massive
columns
on
whose
capitals
lozenges
and
bishop
croziers
were
carved
dated
from
the
eleventh
century
the
altar
stone
survived
intact
brackish
daylight
which
seemed
to
have
been
filtered
through
layers
of
horn
came
in
at
the
openings
hardly
lighting
the
shadowed
begrimed
walls
and
the
earth
floor
which
too
was
pierced
by
the
entrance
to
an
oubliette
or
by
a
well
shaft
in
the
evening
after
dinner
he
had
often
climbed
up
on
the
embankment
and
followed
the
cracked
walls
of
the
ruins
on
bright
nights
one
part
of
the
castle
was
thrown
back
into
shadow
and
the
other
by
contrast
stood
forth
washed
in
silver
and
blue
as
if
rubbed
with
mercurial
lusters
above
the
sèvre
along
whose
surface
streaks
of
moonlight
darted
like
the
backs
of
fishes
the
silence
was
overpowering
after
nine
not
a
dog
not
a
soul
he
would
return
to
the
poor
chamber
of
the
inn
where
an
old
woman
in
black
wearing
the
cornet
her
ancestors
wore
in
the
sixteenth
century
waited
with
a
candle
to
bar
the
door
as
soon
as
he
returned
all
this
said
durtal
to
himself
is
the
skeleton
of
a
dead
keep
to
reanimate
it
we
must
revisualize
the
opulent
flesh
which
once
covered
these
bones
of
sandstone
documents
give
us
every
detail
this
carcass
was
magnificently
clad
and
if
we
are
to
see
gilles
in
his
own
environment
we
must
remember
all
the
sumptuosity
of
fifteenth
century
furnishing
we
must
reclothe
these
walls
with
wainscots
of
irish
wood
or
with
high
warp
tapestries
of
gold
and
thread
of
arras
so
much
sought
after
in
that
epoch
then
this
hard
black
soil
must
be
repaved
with
green
and
yellow
bricks
or
black
and
white
flagstones
the
vault
must
be
starred
with
gold
and
sown
with
crossbows
on
a
field
and
the
cross
on
shield
must
be
set
shining
there
of
themselves
the
furnishings
returned
each
to
its
own
place
here
and
there
were
signorial
chairs
thrones
and
stools
against
the
walls
were
sideboards
on
whose
carved
panels
were
representing
the
annunciation
and
the
adoration
of
the
magi
on
top
of
the
sideboards
beneath
lace
canopies
stood
the
painted
and
gilded
statues
of
saint
anne
saint
marguerite
and
saint
catherine
so
often
reproduced
by
the
of
the
middle
ages
there
were
bound
in
iron
studded
with
great
nails
and
covered
with
sowskin
leather
then
there
were
coffers
fastened
by
great
metal
clasps
and
overlaid
with
leather
or
fabric
on
which
fair
faced
angels
cut
from
illuminated
had
been
mounted
there
were
great
beds
reached
by
carpeted
steps
there
were
tasselled
pillows
and
counterpanes
heavily
perfumed
and
canopies
and
curtains
embroidered
with
armories
or
sprinkled
with
stars
so
one
must
reconstruct
the
decorations
of
the
other
rooms
in
which
nothing
was
standing
but
the
walls
and
the
high
fireplaces
whose
spacious
hearths
wanting
andirons
were
still
charred
from
the
old
fires
one
could
easily
imagine
the
and
those
terrible
repasts
which
gilles
deplored
in
his
trial
at
nantes
gilles
admitted
with
tears
that
he
had
ordered
his
diet
so
as
to
kindle
the
fury
of
his
senses
and
these
reprobate
menus
can
be
easily
reproduced
when
he
was
at
table
with
eustache
blanchet
prelati
gilles
de
sillé
all
his
trusted
companions
in
the
great
room
the
plates
and
the
ewers
filled
with
water
of
medlar
rose
and
melilote
for
washing
the
hands
were
placed
on
credences
gilles
ate
and
roast
heron

crane
peacock
bustard
and

venison
in

nantes

salads
of

of

vehement
dishes
seasoned
with
marjoram
and
mace
coriander
and
sage
peony
and
rosemary
basil
and
hyssop
grain
of
paradise
and
ginger
perfumed
acidulous
dishes
giving
one
a
violent
thirst
heavy
pastries
tarts
of
and
rape
rice
with
milk
of
hazelnuts
sprinkled
with
cinnamon
stuffy
dishes
necessitating
copious
drafts
of
beer
and
fermented
mulberry
juice
of
dry
wine
or
wine
aged
to
tannic
bitterness
of
heady
hypocras
charged
with
cinnamon
with
almonds
and
with
musk
of
raging
liquors
clouded
with
golden
particles
mad
drinks
which
spurred
the
guests
in
this
womanless
castle
to
frenzies
of
lechery
and
made
them
at
the
end
of
the
meal
writhe
in
monstrous
dreams
remain
the
costumes
to
be
restored
said
durtal
to
himself
and
he
imagined
gilles
and
his
friends
not
in
their
damaskeened
field
harness
but
in
their
indoor
costumes
their
robes
of
peace
he
visualized
them
in
harmony
with
the
luxury
of
their
surroundings
they
wore
glittering
vestments
pleated
jackets
bellying
out
in
a
little
flounced
skirt
at
the
waist
the
legs
were
encased
in
dark
hose
on
their
heads
were
the
artichoke
chaperon
hats
like
that
of
charles
vii
in
his
portrait
in
the
louvre
the
torso
was
enveloped
in
damask
which
was
crusted
with
jewelleries
and
bordered
with
marten
he
thought
of
the
costume
of
the
women
of
the
time
robes
of
precious
tentered
stuffs
with
tight
sleeves
great
collars
thrown
back
over
the
shoulders
cramping
bodices
long
trains
lined
with
fur
and
as
he
thus
dressed
an
imaginary
manikin
hanging
ropes
of
heavy
stones
purplish
or
milky
crystals
cloudy
uncut
gems
over
the
slashed
corsage
a
woman
slipped
in
filled
the
robe
swelled
the
bodice
and
thrust
her
head
under
the
from
behind
the
pendent
lace
smiled
the
composite
features
of
the
unknown
and
of
mme
chantelouve
delighted
he
gazed
at
the
apparition
without
ever
perceiving
whom
he
had
evoked
when
his
cat
jumping
into
his
lap
distracted
his
thoughts
and
brought
him
back
to
his
room
well
well
she
wo
let
me
alone
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
began
to
laugh
at
the
thought
of
the
unknown
following
him
even
to
the
château
de
tiffauges
it
foolish
to
let
my
thoughts
wander
this
way
he
said
drawing
himself
up
but
daydream
is
the
only
good
thing
in
life
everything
else
is
vulgar
and
empty
no
doubt
about
it
that
was
a
singular
epoch
the
middle
epoch
of
ignorance
and
darkness
the
history
professors
and
ages
he
went
on
lighting
a
cigarette
for
some
it
all
white
and
for
others
utterly
black
no
intermediate
shade
atheists
reiterate
dolorous
and
exquisite
epoch
say
the
artists
and
the
religious
savants
what
is
certain
is
that
the
immutable
classes
the
nobility
the
clergy
the
bourgeoisie
the
people
had
loftier
souls
at
that
time
you
can
prove
it
society
has
done
nothing
but
deteriorate
in
the
four
centuries
separating
us
from
the
middle
ages
true
a
baron
then
was
usually
a
formidable
brute
he
was
a
drunken
and
lecherous
bandit
a
sanguinary
and
boisterous
tyrant
but
he
was
a
child
in
mind
and
spirit
the
church
bullied
him
and
to
deliver
the
holy
sepulchre
he
sacrificed
his
wealth
abandoned
home
wife
and
children
and
accepted
unconscionable
fatigues
extraordinary
sufferings
dangers
by
pious
heroism
he
redeemed
the
baseness
of
his
morals
the
race
has
since
become
moderate
it
has
reduced
sometimes
even
done
away
with
its
instincts
of
carnage
and
rape
but
it
has
replaced
them
by
the
monomania
of
business
the
passion
for
lucre
it
has
done
worse
it
has
sunk
to
such
a
state
of
abjectness
as
to
be
attracted
by
the
doings
of
the
lowest
of
the
low
the
aristocracy
disguises
itself
as
a
mountebank
puts
on
tights
and
spangles
gives
public
trapeze
performances
jumps
through
hoops
and
does
stunts
in
the
trampled
ring
the
clergy
then
a
good
example
if
we
except
a
few
convents
ravaged
by
frenzied
satanism
and
lechery
launched
itself
into
superhuman
transports
and
attained
god
saints
swarmed
miracles
multiplied
and
while
still
omnipotent
the
church
was
gentle
with
the
humble
it
consoled
the
afflicted
defended
the
little
ones
and
mourned
or
rejoiced
with
the
people
of
low
estate
today
it
hates
the
poor
and
mysticism
dies
in
a
clergy
which
checks
ardent
thoughts
and
preaches
sobriety
of
mind
continence
of
postulation
common
sense
in
prayer
bourgeoisie
of
the
soul
yet
here
and
there
buried
in
cloisters
far
from
these
lukewarm
priests
there
perhaps
still
are
real
saints
who
weep
monks
who
pray
to
the
point
of
dying
of
sorrow
and
prayer
for
each
of
us
and
they
with
the
demoniacs
are
the
sole
connecting
link
between
that
age
and
this
the
smug
sententious
side
of
the
bourgeoisie
already
existed
in
the
time
of
charles
vii
but
cupidity
was
repressed
by
the
confessor
and
the
tradesman
just
like
the
labourer
was
maintained
by
the
corporations
which
denounced
overcharging
and
fraud
saw
that
decried
merchandise
was
destroyed
and
fixed
a
fair
price
and
a
high
standard
of
excellence
for
commodities
trades
and
professions
were
handed
down
from
father
to
son
the
corporations
assured
work
and
pay
people
were
not
as
now
subject
to
the
fluctuations
of
the
market
and
the
merciless
capitalistic
exploitation
great
fortunes
did
not
exist
and
everybody
had
enough
to
live
on
sure
of
the
future
unhurried
they
created
marvels
of
art
whose
secret
remains
for
ever
lost
all
the
artisans
who
passed
the
three
degrees
of
apprentice
journeyman
and
master
developed
subtlety
and
became
veritable
artists
they
ennobled
the
simplest
of
iron
work
the
commonest
faience
the
most
ordinary
chests
and
coffers
those
corporations
putting
themselves
under
the
patronage

they
protected
all
that
is
decisively
at

end
the
bourgeoise
has
taken
the
place
forfeited
by
a
wastrel
nobility
which
now
subsists
only
to
set
ignoble

notified
at
the

that
they
are
not

expect
to
be
recompensed
after
death

so
they
scamp
their
work

take
to

they
revolt

be
slaughtered

let
loose
they
would
act
as

crazed
stampeded
herd
good
god
what
a
mess
and
to
think
that
the
nineteenth
century
takes
on
airs
and
adulates
itself
there
is
one
word
in
the
mouths
of
all
progress
progress
of
whom
progress
of
what
for
this
miserable
century
has
invented
anything
great
it
has
constructed
nothing
and
destroyed
everything
at
the
present
hour
it
glorifies
itself
in
this
electricity
which
it
thinks
it
discovered
but
electricity
was
known
and
used
in
remotest
antiquity
and
if
the
ancients
could
not
explain
its
nature
nor
even
its
essence
the
moderns
are
just
as
incapable
of
identifying
that
force
which
conveys
the
spark
and
carries
the
voice
acutely
nasalized
along
the
wire
this
century
thinks
it
discovered
the
terrible
science
of
hypnotism
which
the
priests
and
brahmins
in
egypt
and
india
knew
and
practised
to
the
utmost
no
the
only
thing
this
century
has
invented
is
the
sophistication
of
products
therein
it
is
passed
master
it
has
even
gone
so
far
as
to
adulterate
excrement
yes
in
the
two
houses
of
parliament
had
to
pass
a
law
destined
to
suppress
the
falsification
of
fertilizer
now
that
the
limit
the
doorbell
rang
he
opened
the
door
and
nearly
fell
over
backward
mme
chantelouve
was
before
him
stupefied
he
bowed
while
mme
chantelouve
without
a
word
went
straight
into
the
study
there
she
turned
around
and
durtal
who
had
followed
found
himself
face
to
face
with
her
wo
you
please
sit
down
he
advanced
an
armchair
and
hastened
to
push
back
with
his
foot
the
edge
of
the
carpet
turned
up
by
the
cat
he
asked
her
to
excuse
the
disorder
she
made
a
vague
gesture
and
remained
standing
in
a
calm
but
very
low
voice
she
said
it
is
i
who
wrote
you
those
mad
letters
i
have
come
to
drive
away
this
bad
fever
and
get
it
over
with
in
a
quite
frank
way
as
you
yourself
wrote
no
liaison
between
us
is
possible
let
us
forget
what
has
happened
and
before
i
go
tell
me
that
you
bear
me
no
grudge
he
cried
out
at
this
he
would
not
have
it
so
he
had
not
been
beside
himself
when
he
wrote
her
those
ardent
pages
he
was
in
perfectly
good
faith
he
loved
her
you
love
me
why
you
did
even
know
that
those
letters
were
from
me
you
loved
an
unknown
a
chimera
well
admitting
that
you
are
telling
the
truth
the
chimera
does
not
exist
now
for
here
i
am
you
are
mistaken
i
knew
perfectly
that
it
was
mme
chantelouve
hiding
behind
the
pseudonym
of
mme
maubel
and
he
to
her
without
of
course
letting
her
know
of
his
doubts
how
he
had
lifted
her
mask
ah
she
reflected
blinking
her
troubled
eyes
at
any
rate
she
said
again
facing
him
squarely
you
could
not
have
recognized
me
in
the
first
letters
to
which
you
responded
with
cries
of
passion
those
cries
were
not
addressed
to
me
he
contested
this
observation
and
became
entangled
in
the
dates
and
happenings
and
in
the
sequence
of
the
notes
she
at
length
lost
the
thread
of
his
remarks
the
situation
was
so
ridiculous
that
both
were
silent
then
she
sat
down
and
burst
out
laughing
her
strident
shrill
laugh
revealing
magnificent
but
short
and
pointed
teeth
in
a
mocking
mouth
vexed
him
she
has
been
playing
with
me
he
said
to
himself
and
dissatisfied
with
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
and
furious
at
seeing
this
woman
so
calm
so
different
from
her
burning
letters
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
irritation
am
i
to
know
why
you
laugh
pardon
me
it
a
trick
my
nerves
play
on
me
sometimes
in
public
places
but
never
mind
let
us
be
reasonable
and
talk
things
over
you
tell
me
you
love
me
and
i
mean
it
well
admitting
that
i
too
am
not
indifferent
where
is
this
going
to
lead
us
oh
you
know
so
well
you
poor
dear
that
you
refused
right
at
first
the
meeting
which
i
asked
in
a
moment
of
madness
and
you
gave
reasons
for
refusing
but
i
refused
because
i
did
not
know
then
that
you
were
the
women
in
the
case
i
have
told
you
that
it
was
several
days
later
that
des
hermies
unwittingly
revealed
your
identity
to
me
did
i
hesitate
as
soon
as
i
knew
no
i
immediately
implored
you
to
come
that
may
be
but
you
admit
that
i
right
when
i
claim
that
you
wrote
your
first
letters
to
another
and
not
me
she
was
pensive
for
a
moment
durtal
began
to
be
prodigiously
bored
by
this
discussion
he
thought
it
more
prudent
not
to
answer
and
was
seeking
a
change
of
subject
that
would
put
an
end
to
the
deadlock
she
herself
got
him
out
of
his
difficulty
let
us
not
discuss
it
any
more
she
said
smiling
we
shall
not
get
anywhere
you
see
this
is
the
situation
i
am
married
to
a
very
nice
man
who
loves
me
and
whose
only
crime
is
that
he
represents
the
rather
insipid
happiness
which
one
has
right
at
hand
i
started
this
correspondence
with
you
so
i
am
to
blame
and
believe
me
on
his
account
i
suffer
you
have
work
to
do
beautiful
books
to
write
you
do
need
to
have
a
crazy
woman
come
walking
into
your
life
so
you
see
the
best
thing
is
for
us
to
remain
friends
but
true
friends
and
go
no
further
and
it
is
the
woman
who
wrote
me
such
vivid
letters
who
now
speaks
to
me
of
reason
good
sense
and
god
knows
what
but
be
frank
now
you
do
love
me
i
do
he
took
her
hands
gently
she
made
no
resistance
but
looking
at
him
squarely
she
said
listen
if
you
had
loved
me
you
would
have
come
to
see
me
and
yet
for
months
you
have
tried
to
find
out
whether
i
was
alive
or
dead
but
you
understand
that
i
could
not
hope
to
be
welcomed
by
you
on
the
terms
we
now
are
on
and
too
in
your
parlour
there
are
guests
your
husband
i
have
never
had
you
even
a
little
bit
to
myself
at
your
home
he
pressed
her
hands
more
tightly
and
came
closer
to
her
she
regarded
him
with
her
smoky
eyes
in
which
he
now
saw
that
dolent
almost
dolorous
expression
which
had
captivated
him
he
completely
lost
control
of
himself
before
this
voluptuous
and
plaintive
face
but
with
a
firm
gesture
she
freed
her
hands
enough
sit
down
now
and
let
talk
of
something
else
do
you
know
your
apartment
is
charming
which
saint
is
that
she
asked
examining
the
picture
over
the
mantel
of
the
monk
on
his
knees
beside
a
cardinal
hat
and
cloak
i
do
not
know
i
will
find
out
for
you
i
have
the
lives
of
all
the
saints
at
home
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
find
out
about
a
cardinal
who
renounced
the
purple
to
go
live
in
a
hut
wait
i
think
saint
peter
damian
did
but
i
am
not
sure
i
have
such
a
poor
memory
help
me
think
but
i
do
know
who
he
is
she
came
closer
to
him
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
are
you
angry
at
me
i
should
say
i
am
when
i
desire
you
frantically
when
i
been
dreaming
for
a
whole
week
about
this
meeting
you
come
here
and
tell
me
that
all
is
over
between
us
that
you
do
not
love
me
she
became
demure
but
if
i
did
not
love
you
would
i
have
come
to
you
understand
then
that
reality
kills
a
dream
that
it
is
better
for
us
not
to
expose
ourselves
to
fearful
regrets
we
are
not
children
you
see
no
let
me
go
do
not
squeeze
me
like
that
very
pale
she
struggled
in
his
embrace
i
swear
to
you
that
i
will
go
away
and
that
you
shall
never
see
me
again
if
you
do
not
let
me
loose
her
voice
became
hard
she
was
almost
hissing
her
words
he
let
go
of
her
sit
down
there
behind
the
table
do
that
for
me
and
tapping
the
floor
with
her
heel
she
said
in
a
tone
of
melancholy
then
it
is
impossible
to
be
friends
only
friends
with
a
man
but
it
would
be
very
nice
to
come
and
see
you
without
having
evil
thoughts
to
fear
would
it
she
was
silent
then
she
added
yes
just
to
see
each
other
and
if
we
did
not
have
any
sublime
things
to
say
to
each
other
it
is
also
very
nice
to
sit
and
say
nothing
then
she
said
my
time
is
up
i
must
go
home
and
leave
me
with
no
hope
he
exclaimed
kissing
her
gloved
hands
she
did
not
answer
but
gently
shook
her
head
then
as
he
looked
pleadingly
at
her
she
said
listen
if
you
will
promise
to
make
no
demands
on
me
and
to
be
good
i
will
come
here
night
after
next
at
nine
he
promised
whatever
she
wished
and
as
he
raised
his
head
from
her
hands
and
as
his
lips
brushed
lightly
over
her
breast
which
seemed
to
tighten
she
disengaged
her
hands
caught
his
nervously
and
clenching
her
teeth
offered
her
neck
to
his
lips
then
she
fled
oof
he
said
closing
the
door
after
her
he
was
at
the
same
time
satisfied
and
vexed
satisfied
because
he
found
her
enigmatic
changeful
charming
now
that
he
was
alone
he
recalled
her
to
memory
he
remembered
her
tight
black
dress
her
fur
cloak
the
warm
collar
of
which
had
caressed
him
as
he
was
covering
her
neck
with
kisses
he
remembered
that
she
wore
no
jewellery
except
sparkling
blue
sapphire
eardrops
he
remembered
the
wayward
blonde
hair
escaping
from
under
the
dark
green
otter
hat
holding
his
hands
to
his
nostrils
he
sniffed
again
the
sweet
and
distant
odour
cinnamon
lost
among
stronger
perfumes
which
he
had
caught
from
the
contact
of
her
long
suède
gloves
and
he
saw
again
her
moist
rodent
teeth
her
thin
bitten
lips
and
her
troubled
eyes
of
a
grey
and
opaque
lustre
which
could
suddenly
be
transfigured
with
radiance
oh
night
after
next
it
will
be
great
to
kiss
all
that
vexed
also
both
with
himself
and
with
her
he
reproached
himself
with
having
been
brusque
and
reserved
he
ought
to
have
shown
himself
more
expansive
and
less
restrained
but
it
was
her
fault
for
she
had
abashed
him
the
incongruity
between
the
woman
who
cried
with
voluptuous
suffering
in
her
letters
and
the
woman
he
had
seen
so
thoroughly
mistress
of
herself
in
her
coquetries
was
truly
too
much
however
you
look
at
them
these
women
are
astonishing
creatures
he
thought
here
is
one
who
accomplishes
the
most
difficult
thing
you
can
imagine
coming
to
a
man
room
after
having
written
him
excessive
letters
i
i
act
like
a
goose
i
stand
there
ill
at
ease
she
in
a
second
has
the
of
a
person
in
her
own
home
or
visiting
in
a
no
awkwardness
pretty
gestures
a
few
words
and
eyes
which
supply
everything
she
is
very
agreeable
he
thought
reminded
of
the
curt
tone
she
had
used
when
disengaging
herself
and
yet
she
has
her
tender
spots
he
continued
dreamily
remembering
not
so
much
her
words
as
certain
inflections
of
her
voice
and
a
certain
bewildered
look
in
her
eyes
i
must
go
about
it
prudently
that
night
he
concluded
addressing
his
cat
which
never
having
seen
a
woman
before
had
fled
at
the
arrival
of
mme
chantelouve
and
taken
refuge
under
the
bed
but
had
now
advanced
almost
grovelling
to
sniff
the
chair
where
she
had
sat
come
to
think
of
it
she
is
an
old
hand
mme
hyacinthe
she
would
not
have
a
meeting
in
a
café
nor
in
the
street
she
scented
from
afar
the
assignation
house
or
the
hotel
and
though
from
the
mere
fact
of
my
not
inviting
her
here
she
could
not
doubt
that
i
did
not
want
to
introduce
her
to
my
lodging
she
came
here
deliberately
then
this
first
denial
come
to
think
of
it
is
only
a
fine
farce
if
she
were
not
seeking
a
liaison
she
would
not
have
visited
me
no
she
wanted
me
to
beg
her
to
do
what
she
wanted
to
do
like
all
women
she
wanted
me
to
offer
her
what
she
desired
i
have
been
rolled
her
arrival
has
knocked
the
props
out
from
under
my
whole
method
but
what
does
it
matter
she
is
no
less
desirable
he
concluded
happy
to
get
rid
of
disagreeable
reflections
and
plunge
back
into
the
delirious
vision
which
he
retained
of
her
that
night
wo
be
exactly
dreary
he
thought
seeing
again
her
eyes
imagining
them
in
surrender
deceptive
and
plaintive
as
he
would
disrobe
her
and
make
a
body
white
and
slender
warm
and
supple
emerge
from
her
tight
skirt
she
has
no
children
that
is
an
earnest
promise
that
her
flesh
is
quite
firm
even
at
thirty
a
whole
draft
of
youth
intoxicated
him
durtal
astonished
took
a
look
at
himself
in
the
mirror
his
tired
eyes
brightened
his
face
seemed
more
youthful
less
worn
lucky
i
had
just
shaved
he
said
to
himself
but
gradually
as
he
mused
he
saw
in
this
mirror
which
he
was
so
little
in
the
habit
of
consulting
his
features
droop
and
his
eyes
lose
their
sparkle
his
stature
which
had
seemed
to
increase
in
this
spiritual
upheaval
diminished
again
sadness
returned
to
his
thoughtful
mien
i
have
what
you
would
call
the
physique
of
a
man
he
concluded
what
does
she
see
in
me
for
she
could
very
easily
find
someone
else
with
whom
to
be
unfaithful
to
her
husband
enough
of
these
rambling
thoughts
let
cease
to
think
them
to
sum
up
the
situation
i
love
her
with
my
head
and
not
my
heart
that
the
important
thing
under
such
conditions
whatever
happens
a
love
affair
is
brief
and
i
am
almost
certain
to
get
out
of
it
without
committing
any
follies
chapter
ix
the
next
morning
he
woke
thinking
of
her
just
as
he
had
been
doing
when
he
went
to
sleep
he
tried
to
rationalize
the
episode
and
revolved
his
conjectures
over
and
over
once
again
he
put
himself
this
question
why
when
i
went
to
her
house
did
she
not
let
me
see
that
i
pleased
her
never
a
look
never
a
word
to
encourage
me
why
this
correspondence
when
it
was
so
easy
to
insist
on
having
me
to
dine
so
simple
to
prepare
an
occasion
which
would
bring
us
together
either
at
her
home
or
elsewhere
and
he
answered
himself
it
would
have
been
usual
and
not
at
all
diverting
she
is
perhaps
skilled
in
these
matters
she
knows
that
the
unknown
frightens
a
man
reason
away
that
the
unembodied
puts
the
soul
in
ferment
and
she
wished
to
give
me
a
fever
before
trying
an
attack
to
call
her
advances
by
their
right
name
it
must
be
admitted
that
if
my
conjectures
are
correct
she
is
strangely
astute
at
heart
she
is
perhaps
quite
simply
a
crazy
romantic
or
a
comedian
it
amuses
her
to
manufacture
little
adventures
to
throw
tantalizing
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
realization
of
a
vulgar
desire
and
chantelouve
he
is
probably
aware
of
his
wife
goings
on
which
perhaps
facilitate
his
career
otherwise
how
could
she
arrange
to
come
here
at
nine
at
night
instead
of
the
morning
or
afternoon
on
pretence
of
going
shopping
to
this
new
question
there
could
be
no
answer
and
little
by
little
he
ceased
to
interrogate
himself
on
the
point
he
began
to
be
obsessed
by
the
real
woman
as
he
had
been
by
the
imaginary
creature
the
latter
had
completely
vanished
he
did
not
even
remember
her
physiognomy
now
mme
chantelouve
just
as
she
was
in
reality
without
borrowing
the
features
had
complete
possession
of
him
and
fired
his
brain
and
senses
to
white
heat
he
began
to
desire
her
madly
and
to
wish
furiously
for
tomorrow
night
and
if
she
did
not
come
he
felt
cold
in
the
small
of
his
back
at
the
idea
that
she
might
be
unable
to
get
away
from
home
or
that
she
might
wilfully
stay
away
high
time
it
was
over
and
done
with
he
said
for
this
saint
dance
went
on
not
without
certain
diminution
of
force
which
disturbed
him
in
fact
he
feared
after
the
febrile
agitation
of
his
nights
to
reveal
himself
as
a
sorry
paladin
when
the
time
came
but
why
bother
he
rejoined
as
he
started
toward
carhaix
where
he
was
to
dine
with
the
astrologer
gévingey
and
des
hermies
i
shall
be
rid
of
my
obsession
awhile
he
murmured
groping
along
in
the
darkness
of
the
tower
des
hermies
hearing
him
come
up
the
stair
opened
the
door
casting
a
shaft
of
light
into
the
spiral
durtal
reaching
the
landing
saw
his
friend
in
shirt
sleeves
and
enveloped
in
an
apron
i
am
as
you
see
in
the
heat
of
composition
and
upon
a
boiling
on
the
stove
des
hermies
cast
that
brief
and
sure
look
which
a
mechanic
gives
his
machine
then
he
consulted
as
if
it
were
a
manometer
his
watch
hanging
to
a
nail
look
he
said
raising
the
pot
lid
durtal
bent
over
and
through
a
cloud
of
vapour
he
saw
a
coiled
napkin
rising
and
falling
with
the
little
billows
where
is
the
leg
of
mutton
it
my
friend
is
sewn
into
that
cloth
so
tightly
that
the
air
can
not
enter
it
is
cooking
in
this
pretty
singing
sauce
into
which
i
have
thrown
a
handful
of
hay
some
pods
of
garlic
and
slices
of
carrot
and
onion
some
grated
nutmeg
and
laurel
and
thyme
you
will
have
many
compliments
to
make
me
if
gévingey
does
keep
us
waiting
too
long
because
a
à
wo
stand
being
cooked
to
shreds
carhaix
wife
looked
in
come
in
she
said
my
husband
is
here
durtal
found
him
dusting
the
books
they
shook
hands
durtal
at
random
looked
over
some
of
the
dusted
books
lying
on
the
table
are
these
he
asked
technical
works
about
metals
and
or
are
they
about
the
liturgy
of
bells
they
are
not
about
founding
though
there
is
sometimes
reference
to
the
founders
the
as
they
were
called
in
the
good
old
days
you
will
discover
here
and
there
some
details
about
alloys
of
red
copper
and
fine
tin
you
will
even
find
i
believe
that
the
art
of
the
has
been
in
decline
for
three
centuries
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
the
faithful
no
longer
melt
down
their
ornaments
of
precious
metals
thus
modifying
the
alloy
or
is
it
because
the
founders
no
longer
invoke
saint
anthony
the
eremite
when
the
bronze
is
boiling
in
the
furnace
i
do
not
know
it
is
true
at
any
rate
that
bells
are
now
made
in
carload
lots
their
voices
are
without
personality
they
are
all
the
same
they
like
docile
and
indifferent
hired
girls
when
formerly
they
were
like
those
aged
servants
who
became
part
of
the
family
whose
joys
and
griefs
they
have
shared
but
what
difference
does
that
make
to
the
clergy
and
the
congregation
at
present
these
auxiliaries
devoted
to
the
cult
do
not
represent
any
symbol
and
that
explains
the
whole
difficulty
you
asked
me
a
few
seconds
ago
whether
these
books
treated
of
bells
from
the
liturgical
point
of
view
yes
most
of
them
give
tabulated
explanations
of
the
significance
of
the
various
component
parts
the
interpretations
are
simple
and
offer
little
variety
what
are
a
few
of
them
i
can
sum
them
all
up
for
you
in
a
very
few
words
according
to
the
of
guillaume
durand
the
hardness
of
the
metal
signifies
the
force
of
the
preacher
the
percussion
of
the
clapper
on
the
sides
expresses
the
idea
that
the
preacher
must
first
scourge
himself
to
correct
himself
of
his
own
vices
before
reproaching
the
vices
of
others
the
wooden
frame
represents
the
cross
of
christ
and
the
cord
which
formerly
served
to
set
the
bell
swinging
allegorizes
the
science
of
the
scriptures
which
flows
from
the
mystery
of
the
cross
itself
the
most
ancient
liturgists
expound
practically
the
same
symbols
jean
beleth
who
lived
in
declares
also
that
the
bell
is
the
image
of
the
preacher
but
adds
that
its
motion
to
and
fro
when
it
is
set
swinging
teaches
that
the
preacher
must
by
turns
elevate
his
language
and
bring
it
down
within
reach
of
the
crowd
for
hugo
of
saint
victor
the
clapper
is
the
tongue
of
the
officiating
priest
which
strikes
the
two
sides
of
the
vase
and
announces
thus
at
the
same
time
the
truth
of
the
two
testaments
finally
if
we
consult
fortunatus
amalarius
perhaps
the
most
ancient
of
the
liturgists
we
find
simply
that
the
body
of
the
bell
denotes
the
mouth
of
the
preacher
and
the
hammer
his
tongue
but
said
durtal
somewhat
disappointed
it
is
what
shall
i
say
very
profound
the
door
opened
why
how
are
you
said
carhaix
shaking
hands
with
gévingey
and
then
introducing
him
to
durtal
while
the
wife
finished
setting
the
table
durtal
examined
the
newcomer
he
was
a
little
man
wearing
a
soft
black
felt
hat
and
wrapped
up
like
an
omnibus
conductor
in
a
cape
with
a
military
collar
of
blue
cloth
his
head
was
like
an
egg
with
the
hollow
downward
the
skull
waxed
as
if
with
siccatif
seemed
to
have
grown
up
out
of
the
hair
which
was
hard
and
like
filaments
of
dried
coconut
and
hung
down
over
his
neck
the
nose
was
bony
and
the
nostrils
opened
like
two
hatchways
over
a
toothless
mouth
which
was
hidden
by
a
moustache
grizzled
like
the
goatee
springing
from
the
short
chin
at
first
glance
one
would
have
taken
him
for
an
a
wood
engraver
or
a
glider
of
saints
images
but
on
looking
at
him
more
closely
observing
the
eyes
round
and
grey
set
close
to
the
nose
almost
crossed
and
studying
his
solemn
voice
and
obsequious
manners
one
asked
oneself
from
what
quite
special
kind
of
sacristy
the
man
had
issued
he
took
off
his
things
and
appeared
in
a
black
frock
coat
of
square
boxlike
cut
a
fine
gold
chain
passed
about
his
neck
lost
itself
in
the
bulging
pocket
of
an
old
vest
durtal
gasped
when
gévingey
as
soon
as
he
had
seated
himself
complacently
put
his
hands
on
exhibition
resting
them
on
his
knees
enormous
freckled
with
blotches
of
orange
and
terminating
in
nails
cut
to
the
quick
the
fingers
were
covered
with
huge
rings
the
sets
of
which
formed
a
phalanx
seeing
durtal
gaze
fixed
on
his
fingers
he
smiled
you
examine
my
valuables
monsieur
they
are
of
three
metals
gold
platinum
and
silver
this
ring
bears
a
scorpion
the
sign
under
which
i
was
born
that
with
its
two
accoupled
triangles
one
pointing
downward
and
the
other
upward
reproduces
the
image
of
the
macrocosm
the
seal
of
solomon
the
grand
pantacle
as
for
the
little
one
you
see
here
he
went
on
showing
a
lady
ring
set
with
a
tiny
sapphire
between
two
roses
that
is
a
present
from
a
person
whose
horoscope
i
was
good
enough
to
cast
ah
said
durtal
somewhat
surprised
at
the
man
dinner
is
ready
said
the
wife
des
hermies
doffing
his
apron
appeared
in
his
tight
cheviot
garments
he
was
not
so
pale
as
usual
his
cheeks
being
red
from
the
heat
of
the
stove
he
set
the
chairs
around
carhaix
served
the
broth
and
everyone
was
silent
taking
spoonfuls
of
the
cooler
broth
at
the
edge
of
the
bowl
then
madame
brought
des
hermies
the
famous
leg
of
mutton
to
cut
it
was
a
magnificent
red
and
large
drops
flowed
beneath
the
knife
everybody
ecstasized
when
tasting
this
robust
meat
aromatic
with
a
purée
of
turnips
sweetened
with
caper
sauce
des
hermies
bowed
under
a
storm
of
compliments
carhaix
filled
the
glasses
and
somewhat
confused
in
the
presence
of
gévingey
paid
the
astrologer
effusive
attention
to
make
him
forget
their
former
des
hermies
assisted
in
this
good
work
and
wishing
also
to
be
useful
to
durtal
brought
the
conversation
around
to
the
subject
of
horoscopes
then
gévingey
mounted
the
rostrum
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
he
spoke
of
his
vast
labours
of
the
six
months
a
horoscope
required
of
the
surprise
of
laymen
when
he
declared
that
such
work
was
not
paid
for
by
the
price
he
asked
five
hundred
francs
but
you
see
i
can
not
give
my
science
for
nothing
he
said
and
now
people
doubt
astrology
which
was
revered
in
antiquity
also
in
the
middle
ages
when
it
was
almost
sacred
for
instance
messieurs
look
at
the
portal
of
notre
dame
the
three
doors
which
archeologists
not
initiated
into
the
symbolism
of
christianity
and
the
occult
designate
by
the
names
of
the
door
of
judgment
the
door
of
the
virgin
and
the
door
of
saint
marcel
or
saint
anne
really
represent
mysticism
astrology
and
alchemy
the
three
great
sciences
of
the
middle
ages
today
you
find
people
who
say
you
quite
sure
that
the
stars
have
an
influence
on
the
destiny
of
man
but
messieurs
without
entering
here
into
details
reserved
for
the
adept
in
what
way
is
this
spiritual
influence
stranger
than
that
corporal
influence
which
certain
planets
the
moon
for
example
exercise
on
the
organs
of
men
and
women
you
are
a
physician
monsieur
des
hermies
and
you
are
not
unaware
that
the
doctors
gillespin
jackson
and
balfour
of
jamaica
have
established
the
influence
of
the
constellations
on
human
health
in
the
west
indies
at
every
change
of
the
moon
the
number
of
sick
people
augments
the
acute
crises
of
fever
coincide
with
the
phases
of
our
satellite
finally
there
are
go
out
in
the
country
and
ascertain
at
what
periods
madness
becomes
epidemic
but
does
this
serve
to
convince
the
incredulous
he
asked
sorrowfully
contemplating
his
rings
it
seems
to
me
on
the
contrary
that
astrology
is
picking
up
said
durtal
there
are
now
two
astrologers
casting
horoscopes
in
the
next
column
to
the
secret
remedies
on
the
fourth
page
of
the
newspapers
and
it
a
shame
those
people
do
even
know
the
first
thing
about
the
science
they
are
simply
tricksters
who
hope
thus
to
pick
up
some
money
what
the
use
of
speaking
of
them
when
they
even
really
it
must
be
admitted
that
only
in
england
and
america
is
there
anybody
who
knows
how
to
establish
the
genethliac
theme
and
construct
a
horoscope
i
am
very
much
afraid
said
des
hermies
that
not
only
these
astrologers
but
also
all
the
mages
theosophists
occultists
and
cabalists
of
the
present
day
know
absolutely
nothing
those
with
whom
i
am
acquainted
are
indubitably
incontestably
ignorant
imbeciles
and
that
is
the
pure
truth
messieurs
these
people
are
for
the
most
part
journalists
or
broken
spendthrifts
seeking
to
exploit
the
taste
of
a
public
weary
of
positivism
they
plagiarize
eliphas
levi
steal
from
fabre
and
write
treatises
of
which
they
themselves
are
incapable
of
making
head
or
tail
it
a
real
pity
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
the
more
so
as
they
discredit
sciences
which
certainly
contain
verities
omitted
in
their
jumble
said
durtal
then
another
lamentable
thing
said
des
hermies
is
that
in
addition
to
the
dupes
and
simpletons
these
little
sects
harbour
some
frightful
charlatans
and
windbags
péladan
among
others
who
does
not
know
that
shoddy
mage
commercialized
to
his
fingertips
cried
durtal
oh
yes
that
fellow
briefly
messieurs
resumed
gévingey
all
these
people
are
incapable
of
obtaining
in
practise
any
effect
whatever
the
only
man
in
this
century
who
without
being
either
a
saint
or
a
diabolist
has
penetrated
the
mysteries
is
william
crookes
and
as
durtal
who
appeared
to
doubt
the
apparitions
sworn
to
by
this
englishman
declared
that
no
theory
could
explain
them
gévingey
perorated
permit
me
messieurs
we
have
the
choice
between
two
diverse
and
i
venture
to
say
very
doctrines
either
the
apparition
is
formed
by
the
fluid
disengaged
by
the
medium
in
trance
to
combine
with
the
fluid
of
the
persons
present
or
else
there
are
in
the
air
immaterial
beings
elementals
as
they
are
called
which
manifest
themselves
under
very
nearly
determinable
conditions
or
else
and
this
is
the
theory
of
pure
spiritism
the
phenomena
are
produced
by
souls
evoked
from
the
dead
i
know
it
durtal
said
and
that
horrifies
me
i
know
also
the
hindu
dogma
of
the
migrations
of
souls
after
death
these
disembodied
souls
stray
until
they
are
reincarnated
or
until
they
attain
from
avatar
to
avatar
to
complete
purity
well
i
think
it
quite
enough
to
live
once
i
prefer
nothingness
a
hole
in
the
ground
to
all
those
metamorphoses
it
more
consoling
to
me
as
for
the
evocation
of
the
dead
the
mere
thought
that
the
butcher
on
the
corner
can
force
the
soul
of
hugo
balzac
baudelaire
to
converse
with
him
would
put
me
beside
myself
if
i
believed
it
ah
no
materialism
abject
as
it
is
is
less
vile
than
that
spiritism
said
carhaix
is
only
a
new
name
for
the
ancient
necromancy
condemned
and
cursed
by
the
church
gévingey
looked
at
his
rings
then
emptied
his
glass
in
any
case
he
returned
you
will
admit
that
these
theories
can
be
upheld
especially
that
of
the
elementals
which
setting
satanism
aside
seems
the
most
veridic
and
certainly
is
the
most
clear
space
is
peopled
by
microbes
is
it
more
surprising
that
space
should
also
be
crammed
with
spirits
and
larvæ
water
and
vinegar
are
alive
with
animalcules
the
microscope
shows
them
to
us
now
why
should
not
the
air
inaccessible
to
the
sight
and
to
the
instruments
of
man
swarm
like
the
other
elements
with
beings
more
or
less
corporeal
embryos
more
or
less
mature
that
is
probably
why
cats
suddenly
look
upward
and
gaze
curiously
into
space
at
something
that
is
passing
and
that
we
ca
see
said
the
wife
no
thanks
said
gévingey
to
des
hermies
who
was
offering
him
another
helping
of
salad
my
friends
said
the
you
forget
only
one
doctrine
that
of
the
church
which
attributes
all
these
inexplicable
phenomena
to
satan
catholicism
has
known
them
for
a
long
time
it
did
not
need
to
wait
for
the
first
manifestations
of
the
spirits
which
were
produced
i
believe
in
in
the
united
states
through
the
fox
family
before
decreeing
that
spirit
rapping
came
from
the
devil
you
will
find
in
saint
augustine
the
proof
for
he
had
to
send
a
priest
to
put
an
end
to
noises
and
overturning
of
objects
and
furniture
in
the
diocese
of
hippo
analogous
to
those
which
spiritism
points
out
at
the
time
of
theodoric
also
saint
cæsaræus
ridded
a
house
of
lemurs
haunting
it
you
see
there
are
only
the
city
of
god
and
the
city
of
the
devil
now
since
god
is
above
these
cheap
manipulations
the
occultists
and
spiritists
satanize
more
or
less
whether
they
wish
to
or
not
nevertheless
spiritism
has
accomplished
one
important
thing
it
has
violated
the
threshold
of
the
unknown
broken
the
doors
of
the
sanctuary
it
has
brought
about
in
the
extranatural
a
revolution
similar
to
that
which
was
effected
in
the
terrestrial
order
in
france
in
it
has
democratized
evocation
and
opened
a
whole
new
vista
only
it
has
lacked
initiates
to
lead
it
and
proceeding
at
random
without
science
it
has
agitated
good
and
bad
spirits
together
in
spiritism
you
will
find
a
jumble
of
everything
it
is
the
hash
of
mystery
if
i
may
be
permitted
the
expression
the
saddest
thing
about
it
said
des
hermies
laughing
is
that
at
a
séance
one
never
sees
a
thing
i
know
that
experiments
have
been
successful
but
those
which
i
have
witnessed
well
the
experimenters
seemed
to
take
a
long
shot
and
miss
that
is
not
surprising
said
the
astrologer
spreading
some
firm
candied
orange
jelly
on
a
piece
of
bread
the
first
law
to
observe
in
magism
and
spiritism
is
to
send
away
the
unbelievers
because
very
often
their
fluid
is
antagonistic
to
that
of
the
clairvoyant
or
the
medium
then
how
can
there
be
any
assurance
of
the
reality
of
the
phenomena
thought
durtal
carhaix
rose
i
shall
be
back
in
ten
minutes
he
put
on
his
greatcoat
and
soon
the
sound
of
his
steps
was
lost
in
the
tower
true
murmured
durtal
consulting
his
watch
it
a
quarter
to
eight
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
in
the
room
as
all
refused
to
have
any
more
dessert
mme
carhaix
took
up
the
tablecloth
and
spread
an
oilcloth
in
its
place
the
astrologer
played
with
his
rings
turning
them
about
durtal
was
rolling
a
pellet
of
crumbled
bread
between
his
fingers
des
hermies
leaning
over
to
one
side
pulled
from
his
patch
pocket
his
embossed
japanese
pouch
and
made
a
cigarette
then
when
the
wife
had
bidden
them
good
night
and
retired
to
her
room
des
hermies
got
the
kettle
and
the
coffee
pot
want
any
help
durtal
proposed
you
can
get
the
little
glasses
and
uncork
the
liqueur
bottles
if
you
will
as
he
opened
the
cupboard
durtal
swayed
dizzy
from
the
strokes
of
the
bells
which
shook
the
walls
and
filled
the
room
with
clamour
if
there
are
spirits
in
this
room
they
must
be
getting
knocked
to
pieces
he
said
setting
the
liqueur
glasses
on
the
table
bells
drive
phantoms
and
spectres
away
gévingey
answered
doctorally
filling
his
pipe
here
said
des
hermies
will
you
pour
hot
water
slowly
into
the
filter
i
got
to
feed
the
stove
it
getting
chilly
here
my
feet
are
freezing
carhaix
returned
blowing
out
his
lantern
the
bell
was
in
good
voice
this
clear
dry
night
and
he
took
off
his
mountaineer
cap
and
his
overcoat
what
do
you
think
of
him
des
hermies
asked
durtal
in
a
very
low
voice
and
pointed
at
the
astrologer
now
lost
in
a
cloud
of
pipe
smoke
in
repose
he
looks
like
an
old
owl
and
when
he
speaks
he
makes
me
think
of
a
melancholy
and
discursive
schoolmaster
only
one
said
des
hermies
to
carhaix
who
was
holding
a
lump
of
sugar
over
des
hermies
coffee
cup
i
hear
monsieur
that
you
are
occupied
with
a
history
of
gilles
de
rais
said
gévingey
to
durtal
yes
for
the
time
being
i
am
up
to
my
eyes
in
satanism
with
that
man
and
said
des
hermies
we
were
just
going
to
appeal
to
your
extensive
knowledge
you
only
can
enlighten
my
friend
on
one
of
the
most
obscure
questions
of
diabolism
which
one
that
of
incubacy
and
succubacy
gévingey
did
not
answer
at
once
that
is
a
much
graver
question
than
spiritism
he
said
at
last
and
grave
in
a
different
way
but
monsieur
already
knows
something
about
it
only
that
opinions
differ
del
rio
and
bodin
for
instance
consider
the
incubi
as
masculine
demons
which
couple
with
women
and
the
succubi
as
demons
who
consummate
the
carnal
act
with
men
according
to
their
theories
the
incubi
take
the
semen
lost
by
men
in
dream
and
make
use
of
it
so
that
two
questions
arise
first
can
a
child
be
born
of
such
a
union
the
possibility
of
this
kind
of
procreation
has
been
upheld
by
the
church
doctors
who
affirm
even
that
children
of
such
commerce
are
heavier
than
others
and
can
drain
three
nurses
without
taking
on
flesh
the
second
question
is
whether
the
demon
who
copulates
with
the
mother
or
the
man
whose
semen
has
been
taken
is
the
father
of
the
child
to
which
saint
thomas
answers
with
more
or
less
subtle
arguments
that
the
real
father
is
not
the
incubus
but
the
man
for
sinistrari
observed
durtal
the
incubi
and
succubi
are
not
precisely
demons
but
animal
spirits
intermediate
between
the
demon
and
the
angel
a
sort
of
satyr
or
faun
such
as
were
revered
in
the
time
of
paganism
a
sort
of
imp
such
as
were
exorcised
in
the
middle
ages
sinistrari
adds
that
they
do
not
need
to
pollute
a
sleeping
man
since
they
possess
genitals
and
are
endowed
with
prolificacy
well
there
is
nothing
further
said
gévingey
görres
so
learned
so
precise
in
his
passes
rapidly
over
this
question
even
neglects
it
and
the
church
you
know
is
completely
silent
for
the
church
does
not
like
to
treat
this
subject
and
views
askance
the
priest
who
does
occupy
himself
with
it
i
beg
your
pardon
said
carhaix
always
ready
to
defend
the
church
the
church
has
never
hesitated
to
declare
itself
on
this
detestable
subject
the
existence
of
succubi
and
incubi
is
certified
by
saint
augustine
saint
thomas
saint
bonaventure
denys
le
chartreux
pope
innocent
viii
and
how
many
others
the
question
is
resolutely
settled
for
every
catholic
it
also
figures
in
the
lives
of
some
of
the
saints
if
i
am
not
mistaken
yes
in
the
legend
of
saint
hippolyte
jacques
de
voragine
tells
how
a
priest
tempted
by
a
naked
succubus
cast
his
stole
at
its
head
and
it
suddenly
became
the
corpse
of
some
dead
woman
whom
the
devil
had
animated
to
seduce
him
yes
said
gévingey
whose
eyes
twinkled
the
church
recognizes
succubacy
i
grant
but
let
me
speak
and
you
will
see
that
my
observations
are
not
uncalled
for
you
know
very
well
messieurs
addressing
des
hermies
and
durtal
what
the
books
teach
but
within
a
hundred
years
everything
has
changed
and
if
the
facts
i
am
are
unknown
to
the
many
members
of
the
clergy
and
you
will
not
find
them
cited
in
any
book
whatever
at
present
it
is
less
frequently
demons
than
bodies
raised
from
the
dead
which
fill
the
indispensable
rôle
of
incubus
and
succubus
in
other
words
formerly
the
living
being
subject
to
succubacy
was
known
to
be
possessed
now
that
vampirism
by
the
evocation
of
the
dead
is
joined
to
demonism
the
victim
is
worse
than
possessed
the
church
did
not
know
what
to
do
either
it
must
keep
silent
or
reveal
the
possibility
of
the
evocation
of
the
dead
already
forbidden
by
moses
and
this
admission
was
dangerous
for
it
popularized
the
knowledge
of
acts
that
are
easier
to
produce
now
than
formerly
since
without
knowing
it
spiritism
has
traced
the
way
so
the
church
has
kept
silent
and
rome
is
not
unaware
of
the
frightful
advance
incubacy
has
made
in
the
cloisters
in
our
days
that
proves
that
continence
is
hard
to
bear
in
solitude
said
des
hermies
it
merely
proves
that
the
soul
is
feeble
and
that
people
have
forgotten
how
to
pray
said
carhaix
however
that
may
be
messieurs
to
instruct
you
completely
in
this
matter
i
must
divide
the
creatures
smitten
with
incubacy
or
succubacy
into
two
classes
the
first
is
composed
of
persons
who
have
directly
and
voluntarily
given
themselves
over
to
the
demoniac
action
of
the
spirits
these
persons
are
quite
rare
and
they
all
die
by
suicide
or
some
other
form
of
violent
death
the
second
is
composed
of
persons
on
whom
the
visitation
of
spirits
has
been
imposed
by
a
spell
these
are
very
numerous
especially
in
the
convents
dominated
by
the
demoniac
societies
ordinarily
these
victims
end
in
madness
the
psychopathic
hospitals
are
crowded
with
them
the
doctors
and
the
majority
of
the
priests
do
not
know
the
cause
of
their
madness
but
the
cases
are
curable
a
thaumaturge
of
my
acquaintance
has
saved
a
good
many
of
the
bewitched
who
without
his
aid
would
be
howling
under
hydrotherapeutic
douches
there
are
certain
fumigations
certain
exsufflations
certain
commandments
written
on
a
sheet
of
virgin
parchment
thrice
blessed
and
worn
like
an
amulet
which
almost
always
succeed
in
delivering
the
patient
i
want
to
ask
you
said
des
hermies
does
a
woman
receive
the
visit
of
the
incubus
while
she
is
asleep
or
while
she
is
awake
a
distinction
must
be
made
if
the
woman
is
not
the
victim
of
a
spell
if
she
voluntarily
consorts
with
the
impure
spirit
she
is
always
awake
when
the
carnal
act
takes
place
if
on
the
other
hand
the
woman
is
the
victim
of
sorcery
the
sin
is
committed
either
while
she
is
asleep
or
while
she
is
awake
but
in
the
latter
case
she
is
in
a
cataleptic
state
which
prevents
her
from
defending
herself
the
most
powerful
of
exorcists
the
man
who
has
gone
most
thoroughly
into
this
matter
one
johannès
doctor
of
theology
told
me
that
he
had
saved
nuns
who
had
been
ridden
without
respite
for
two
three
even
four
days
by
incubi
i
know
that
priest
remarked
des
hermies
and
the
act
is
consummated
in
the
same
manner
as
the
normal
human
act
yes
and
no
here
the
dirtiness
of
the
details
makes
me
hesitate
said
gévingey
becoming
slightly
red
what
i
can
tell
you
is
more
than
strange
know
then
that
the
organ
of
the
incubus
is
bifurcated
and
at
the
same
time
penetrates
both
vases
formerly
it
extended
and
while
one
branch
of
the
fork
acted
in
the
licit
channels
the
other
at
the
same
time
reached
up
to
the
lower
part
of
the
face
you
may
imagine
gentlemen
how
life
must
be
shortened
by
operations
which
are
multiplied
through
all
the
senses
and
you
are
sure
that
these
are
facts
absolutely
but
come
now
you
have
proofs
gévingey
was
silent
then
the
subject
is
so
grave
and
i
have
gone
so
far
that
i
had
better
go
the
rest
of
the
way
i
am
not
mad
nor
the
victim
of
hallucination
well
messieurs
i
slept
one
time
in
the
room
of
the
most
redoubtable
master
satanism
now
can
claim
canon
docre
des
hermies
interposed
yes
and
my
sleep
was
fitful
it
was
broad
daylight
i
swear
to
you
that
the
succubus
came
irritant
and
palpable
and
most
tenacious
happily
i
remembered
the
formula
of
deliverance
which
kept
me
so
i
ran
that
very
day
to
doctor
johannès
of
whom
i
have
spoken
he
immediately
and
forever
i
hope
liberated
me
from
the
spell
if
i
did
not
fear
to
be
indiscreet
i
would
ask
you
what
kind
of
thing
this
succubus
was
whose
attack
you
repulsed
why
it
was
like
any
naked
woman
said
the
astrologer
hesitantly
curious
now
if
it
had
demanded
its
little
gifts
its
little
gloves
said
durtal
biting
his
lips
and
do
you
know
what
has
become
of
the
terrible
docre
des
hermies
inquired
no
thank
god
they
say
he
is
in
the
south
somewhere
around
nîmes
where
he
formerly
resided
but
what
does
this
abbé
do
inquired
durtal
what
does
he
do
he
evokes
the
devil
and
he
feeds
white
mice
on
the
hosts
which
he
consecrates
his
frenzy
for
sacrilege
is
such
that
he
had
the
image
of
christ
tattooed
on
his
heels
so
that
he
could
always
step
on
the
saviour
well
murmured
carhaix
whose
militant
moustache
bristled
while
his
great
eyes
flamed
if
that
abominable
priest
were
here
i
swear
to
you
that
i
would
respect
his
feet
but
that
i
would
throw
him
downstairs
head
first
and
the
black
mass
inquired
des
hermies
he
celebrates
it
with
foul
men
and
women
he
is
openly
accused
of
having
influenced
people
to
make
wills
in
his
favor
and
of
causing
inexplicable
death
unfortunately
there
are
no
laws
to
repress
sacrilege
and
how
can
you
prosecute
a
man
who
sends
maladies
from
a
distance
and
kills
slowly
in
such
a
way
that
at
the
autopsy
no
traces
of
poison
appear
the
modern
gilles
de
rais
exclaimed
durtal
yes
less
savage
less
frank
more
hypocritically
cruel
he
does
not
cut
throats
he
probably
limits
himself
to
or
to
causing
suicide
by
suggestion
said
des
hermies
for
he
is
i
believe
a
master
hypnotist
could
he
insinuate
into
a
victim
the
idea
to
drink
regularly
in
graduated
doses
a
toxin
which
he
would
designate
and
which
would
simulate
the
phases
of
a
malady
asked
durtal
nothing
simpler
window
burglars
that
the
physicians
of
the
present
day
are
they
recognize
perfectly
the
ability
of
a
more
skilful
man
to
pull
off
such
jobs
the
experiments
of
beaunis
liégois
liébaut
and
bernheim
are
conclusive
you
can
even
get
a
person
assassinated
by
another
to
whom
you
suggest
without
his
knowledge
the
will
to
the
crime
i
was
thinking
of
something
myself
said
carhaix
who
had
been
reflecting
and
not
listening
to
this
discussion
of
hypnotism
of
the
inquisition
it
certainly
had
its
reason
for
being
it
is
the
only
agent
that
could
deal
with
this
fallen
priest
whom
the
church
has
swept
out
and
remember
said
des
hermies
with
his
crooked
smile
playing
around
the
corner
of
his
mouth
that
the
ferocity
of
the
inquisition
has
been
greatly
exaggerated
no
doubt
the
benevolent
bodin
speaks
of
driving
long
needles
between
the
nails
and
the
flesh
of
the
sorcerers
fingers
excellent
gehenna
says
he
he
eulogizes
equally
the
torture
by
fire
which
he
characterizes
as
exquisite
death
but
he
wishes
only
to
turn
the
magicians
away
from
their
detestable
practises
and
save
their
souls
then
del
rio
declares
that
question
must
not
be
applied
to
demoniacs
after
they
have
eaten
for
fear
they
will
vomit
he
worried
about
their
stomachs
this
worthy
man
was
it
also
he
who
decreed
that
the
torture
must
not
be
repeated
twice
in
the
same
day
so
as
to
give
fear
and
pain
a
chance
to
calm
down
admit
that
the
good
jesuit
was
not
devoid
of
delicacy
docre
gévingey
went
on
not
paying
any
attention
to
the
words
of
des
hermies
is
the
only
individual
who
has
rediscovered
the
ancient
secrets
and
who
obtains
results
in
practise
he
is
rather
more
powerful
i
would
have
you
believe
than
all
those
fools
and
quacks
of
whom
we
have
been
speaking
and
they
know
the
terrible
canon
for
he
has
sent
many
of
them
serious
attacks
of
ophthalmia
which
the
oculists
can
not
cure
so
they
tremble
when
the
name
docre
is
pronounced
in
their
presence
but
how
did
a
priest
fall
so
low
i
ca
say
if
you
wish
ampler
information
about
him
said
gévingey
addressing
des
hermies
question
your
friend
chantelouve
chantelouve
cried
durtal
yes
he
and
his
wife
used
to
be
quite
intimate
with
canon
docre
but
i
hope
for
their
sakes
that
they
have
long
since
ceased
to
have
dealings
with
the
monster
durtal
listened
no
more
mme
chantelouve
knew
canon
docre
ah
was
she
satanic
too
no
she
certainly
did
not
act
like
a
possessed
surely
this
astrologer
is
cracked
he
thought
she
and
he
called
her
image
before
him
and
thought
that
tomorrow
night
she
would
probably
give
herself
to
him
ah
those
strange
eyes
of
hers
those
dark
clouds
suddenly
cloven
by
radiant
light
she
came
now
and
took
complete
possession
of
him
as
before
he
had
ascended
to
the
tower
but
if
i
did
love
you
would
i
have
come
to
you
that
sentence
which
she
had
spoken
with
a
caressing
inflection
of
the
voice
he
heard
again
and
again
he
saw
her
mocking
and
tender
face
ah
you
are
dreaming
said
des
hermies
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
we
have
to
go
it
striking
ten
when
they
were
in
the
street
they
said
good
night
to
gévingey
who
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
then
they
walked
along
a
little
way
well
said
des
hermies
are
you
interested
in
my
astrologer
he
is
slightly
mad
is
he
slightly
humph
well
his
stories
are
incredible
everything
is
incredible
said
des
hermies
placidly
turning
up
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
however
i
will
admit
that
gévingey
astounds
me
when
he
asserts
that
he
was
visited
by
a
succubus
his
good
faith
is
not
to
be
doubted
for
i
know
him
to
be
a
man
who
means
what
he
says
though
he
is
vain
and
doctorial
i
know
too
that
at
la
salpêtrière
such
occurrences
are
not
rare
women
smitten
with
see
phantoms
beside
them
in
broad
daylight
and
mate
with
them
in
a
cataleptic
state
and
every
night
couch
with
visions
that
must
be
exactly
like
the
fluid
creatures
of
incubacy
but
these
women
are
and
gévingey
is
for
i
am
his
physician
then
what
can
be
believed
and
what
can
be
proved
the
materialists
have
taken
the
trouble
to
revise
the
accounts
of
the
sorcery
trials
of
old
they
have
found
in
the
of
the
ursulines
of
loudun
and
the
nuns
of
poitiers
in
the
history
even
of
the
convulsionists
of
saint
médard
the
symptoms
of
major
hysteria
the
same
contractions
of
the
whole
system
the
same
muscular
dissolutions
the
same
lethargies
even
finally
the
famous
arc
of
the
circle
and
what
does
this
demonstrate
that
these
demonomaniacs
were
certainly
the
observations
of
richet
expert
in
such
matters
are
conclusive
but
wherein
do
they
invalidate
possession
from
the
fact
that
the
patients
of
la
salpêtrière
are
not
possessed
though
they
are
hysterical
does
it
follow
that
others
smitten
with
the
same
malady
as
they
are
not
possessed
it
would
have
to
be
demonstrated
also
that
all
demonopathics
are
hysterical
and
that
is
false
for
there
are
women
of
sound
mind
and
perfectly
good
sense
who
are
demonopathic
without
knowing
it
and
admitting
that
the
last
point
is
controvertible
there
remains
this
unanswerable
question
is
a
woman
possessed
because
she
is
hysterical
or
is
she
hysterical
because
she
is
possessed
only
the
church
can
answer
science
can
not
no
come
to
think
it
over
the
effrontery
of
the
positivists
is
appalling
they
decree
that
satanism
does
not
exist
they
lay
everything
at
the
account
of
major
hysteria
and
they
do
even
know
what
this
frightful
malady
is
and
what
are
its
causes
no
doubt
charcot
determines
very
well
the
phases
of
the
attack
notes
the
nonsensical
and
passional
attitudes
the
contortionistic
movements
he
discovers
hysterogenic
zones
and
can
by
skilfully
manipulating
the
ovaries
arrest
or
accelerate
the
crises
but
as
for
foreseeing
them
and
learning
the
sources
and
the
motives
and
curing
them
that
another
thing
science
goes
all
to
pieces
on
the
question
of
this
inexplicable
stupefying
malady
which
consequently
is
subject
to
the
most
diversified
interpretations
not
one
of
which
can
be
declared
exact
for
the
soul
enters
into
this
the
soul
in
conflict
with
the
body
the
soul
overthrown
in
the
demoralization
of
the
nerves
you
see
old
man
all
this
is
as
dark
as
a
bottle
of
ink
mystery
is
everywhere
and
reason
can
not
see
its
way
mmmm
said
durtal
who
was
now
in
front
of
his
door
since
anything
can
be
maintained
and
nothing
is
certain
succubacy
has
it
basically
it
is
more
literary
and
cleaner
than
positivism
chapter
x
the
day
was
long
and
hard
to
kill
waking
at
dawn
full
of
thoughts
of
mme
chantelouve
he
could
not
stay
in
one
place
and
kept
inventing
excuses
for
going
out
he
had
no
cakes
bonbons
and
exotic
liqueurs
and
one
must
not
be
without
all
the
little
essentials
when
expecting
a
visit
from
a
woman
he
went
by
the
longest
route
to
the
avenue
de
to
buy
fine
essences
of
cedar
and
of
that
alkermes
which
makes
the
person
tasting
it
think
he
is
in
an
oriental
pharmaceutic
laboratory
the
idea
is
he
said
not
so
much
to
treat
hyacinthe
as
to
astound
her
by
giving
her
a
sip
of
an
unknown
elixir
he
came
back
laden
with
packages
then
went
out
again
and
in
the
street
was
assailed
by
an
immense
ennui
after
an
interminable
tour
of
the
quays
he
finally
tumbled
into
a
beer
hall
he
fell
on
a
bench
and
opened
a
newspaper
what
was
he
thinking
as
he
sat
not
reading
but
just
looking
at
the
police
news
nothing
not
even
of
her
from
having
revolved
the
same
matter
over
and
over
again
and
again
his
mind
had
reached
a
deadlock
and
refused
to
function
durtal
merely
found
himself
very
tired
very
drowsy
as
one
in
a
warm
bath
after
a
night
of
travel
i
must
go
home
pretty
soon
he
said
when
he
could
collect
himself
a
little
for
père
rateau
certainly
has
not
cleaned
house
in
the
thorough
fashion
which
i
commanded
and
of
course
i
do
want
the
furniture
to
be
covered
with
dust
six
suppose
i
dine
after
a
fashion
in
some
not
too
unreliable
place
he
remembered
a
nearby
restaurant
where
he
had
eaten
before
without
a
great
deal
of
dread
he
chewed
his
way
laboriously
through
an
extremely
dead
fish
then
through
a
piece
of
meat
flabby
and
cold
then
he
found
a
very
few
lentils
stiff
with
insecticide
beneath
a
great
deal
of
sauce
finally
he
savoured
some
ancient
prunes
whose
juice
smelt
of
mould
and
was
at
the
same
time
aquatic
and
sepulchral
back
in
his
apartment
he
lighted
fires
in
his
bedroom
and
in
his
study
then
he
inspected
everything
he
was
not
mistaken
the
concierge
had
upset
the
place
with
the
same
brutality
the
same
haste
as
customarily
however
he
must
have
tried
to
wash
the
windows
because
the
glass
was
streaked
with
finger
marks
durtal
effaced
the
imprints
with
a
damp
cloth
smoothed
out
the
folds
in
the
carpet
drew
the
curtains
and
put
the
bookcases
in
order
after
dusting
them
with
a
napkin
everywhere
he
found
grains
of
tobacco
trodden
cigarette
ashes
pencil
sharpenings
pen
points
eaten
with
rust
he
also
found
cocoons
of
cat
fur
and
crumpled
bits
of
rough
draft
manuscript
which
had
been
whirled
into
all
corners
by
the
furious
sweeping
he
finally
could
not
help
asking
himself
why
he
had
so
long
tolerated
the
fuzzy
filth
which
obscured
and
incrusted
his
household
while
he
dusted
his
indignation
against
rateau
increased
mightily
look
at
that
he
said
perceiving
his
wax
candles
grown
as
yellow
as
tallow
ones
he
changed
them
that
better
he
arranged
his
desk
into
studied
disarray
notebooks
and
books
with
in
them
for
he
laid
in
careful
disorder
symbol
of
work
he
said
smiling
as
he
placed
an
old
folio
open
on
a
chair
then
he
passed
into
his
bedroom
with
a
wet
sponge
he
freshened
up
the
marble
of
the
dresser
then
he
smoothed
the
bed
cover
straightened
his
photographs
and
engravings
and
went
into
the
bathroom
here
he
paused
disheartened
in
a
bamboo
rack
over
the
there
was
a
chaos
of
phials
resolutely
he
grabbed
the
perfume
bottles
scoured
the
bottoms
and
necks
with
emery
rubbed
the
labels
with
gum
elastic
and
bread
crumbs
then
he
soaped
the
tub
dipped
the
combs
and
brushes
in
an
ammoniac
solution
got
his
vapourizer
to
working
and
sprayed
the
room
with
persian
lilac
washed
the
linoleum
and
scoured
the
seat
and
the
pipes
seized
with
a
mania
for
cleanliness
he
polished
scrubbed
scraped
moistened
and
dried
with
great
sweeping
strokes
of
the
arm
he
was
no
longer
vexed
at
the
concierge
he
was
even
sorry
the
old
villain
had
not
left
him
more
to
do
then
he
shaved
touched
up
his
moustache
and
proceeded
to
make
an
elaborate
toilet
asking
himself
as
he
dressed
whether
he
had
better
wear
button
shoes
or
slippers
he
decided
that
shoes
were
less
familiar
and
more
dignified
but
resolved
to
wear
a
flowing
tie
and
a
blouse
thinking
that
this
artistic
negligée
would
please
a
woman
all
ready
he
said
after
a
last
stroke
of
the
brush
he
made
the
turn
of
the
other
rooms
poked
the
fires
and
fed
the
cat
which
was
running
about
in
alarm
sniffing
all
the
cleaned
objects
and
doubtless
thinking
that
those
he
rubbed
against
every
day
without
paying
any
attention
to
them
had
been
replaced
by
new
ones
oh
the
essentials
i
am
forgetting
durtal
put
the
teakettle
on
the
hob
and
placed
cups
teapot
sugar
bowl
cakes
bonbons
and
tiny
liqueur
glasses
on
an
old
lacquered
waiter
so
as
to
have
everything
on
hand
when
it
was
time
to
serve
now
i
through
i
given
the
place
a
thorough
cleaning
let
her
come
he
said
to
himself
realigning
some
books
whose
backs
stuck
out
further
than
the
others
on
the
shelves
everything
in
good
shape
except
the
chimney
of
the
lamp
where
it
bulges
there
are
caramel
specks
and
blobs
of
soot
but
i
ca
get
the
thing
out
i
do
want
to
burn
my
fingers
and
anyway
with
the
shade
lowered
a
bit
she
notice
well
how
shall
i
proceed
when
she
does
come
he
asked
himself
sinking
into
an
armchair
she
enters
good
i
take
her
hands
i
kiss
them
then
i
bring
her
into
this
room
i
have
her
sit
down
beside
the
fire
in
this
chair
i
station
myself
facing
her
on
this
stool
advancing
a
little
touching
her
knees
i
can
seize
her
i
make
her
bend
over
i
am
supporting
her
whole
weight
i
bring
her
lips
to
mine
and
i
am
saved
or
rather
lost
for
then
the
bother
begins
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
getting
her
into
the
bedroom
undressing
and
going
to
bed
that
part
is
appalling
unless
you
know
each
other
very
well
and
when
you
are
just
becoming
acquainted
the
nice
way
is
to
have
a
cosy
little
supper
for
two
the
wine
has
an
ungodly
kick
to
it
she
immediately
passes
out
and
when
she
comes
to
she
is
lying
in
bed
under
a
shower
of
kisses
as
we
ca
do
it
that
way
we
shall
have
to
avoid
mutual
embarrassment
by
making
a
show
of
passion
if
i
speed
up
the
tempo
and
pretend
to
be
in
a
frenzy
perhaps
we
shall
not
have
time
to
think
about
the
miserable
details
so
i
must
possess
her
here
in
this
very
spot
and
she
must
think
i
have
lost
my
head
when
she
succumbs
it
hard
to
arrange
in
this
room
because
there
is
any
divan
the
best
way
would
be
to
throw
her
down
on
the
carpet
she
can
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
as
they
always
do
i
shall
take
good
care
to
turn
down
the
lamp
before
she
rises
well
i
had
better
prepare
a
cushion
for
her
head
he
found
one
and
slid
it
under
the
chair
and
i
had
better
not
wear
suspenders
for
they
often
cause
ridiculous
delays
he
took
them
off
and
put
on
a
belt
but
then
there
is
that
damned
question
of
the
skirts
i
admire
the
novelists
who
can
get
a
virgin
unharnessed
from
her
corsets
and
deflowered
in
the
winking
of
an
eye
as
if
it
were
possible
how
annoying
to
have
to
fight
one
way
through
all
those
starched
entanglements
i
do
hope
mme
chantelouve
will
be
considerate
and
avoid
those
ridiculous
difficulties
as
much
as
possible
for
her
own
sake
he
consulted
his
watch
eight
i
must
expect
her
for
nearly
an
hour
because
like
all
women
she
will
come
late
what
kind
of
an
excuse
will
she
make
to
chantelouve
to
get
away
tonight
well
that
is
none
of
my
business
hmmm
this
water
heater
beside
the
fire
looks
like
the
invitation
to
the
toilet
but
no
the
tea
things
handy
banish
any
gross
idea
and
if
hyacinthe
did
not
come
she
will
come
he
said
to
himself
suddenly
moved
what
motive
would
she
have
for
staying
away
she
knows
that
she
can
not
inflame
me
more
than
i
am
inflamed
then
jumping
from
phase
to
phase
of
the
same
old
question
this
will
turn
out
badly
of
course
he
decided
once
i
am
satisfied
disenchantment
is
inevitable
oh
well
so
much
the
better
for
with
this
romance
going
on
i
can
not
work
miserable
me
relapsing
only
in
mind
alas
to
the
age
of
twenty
i
am
waiting
for
a
woman
i
who
have
scorned
the
doings
of
lovers
for
years
and
years
i
look
at
my
watch
every
five
minutes
and
i
listen
in
spite
of
myself
thinking
it
is
her
step
i
hear
on
the
stair
no
there
is
no
getting
around
it
the
little
blue
flower
the
perennial
of
the
soul
is
difficult
to
extirpate
and
it
keeps
growing
up
again
it
does
not
show
itself
for
twenty
years
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
you
know
not
why
nor
how
it
sprouts
and
then
forth
comes
a
burst
of
blossoms
my
god
i
am
getting
foolish
he
jumped
from
his
chair
there
was
a
gentle
ring
not
nine
yet
it
is
she
he
murmured
opening
the
door
he
squeezed
her
hands
and
thanked
her
for
being
so
punctual
she
said
she
was
not
feeling
well
i
came
only
because
i
did
want
to
keep
you
waiting
in
vain
his
heart
sank
i
have
a
fearful
headache
she
said
passing
her
gloved
hands
over
her
forehead
he
took
her
furs
and
motioned
her
to
the
armchair
prepared
to
follow
his
plan
of
attack
he
sat
down
on
the
stool
but
she
refused
the
armchair
and
took
a
seat
beside
the
table
rising
he
bent
over
her
and
caught
hold
of
her
fingers
your
hand
is
burning
she
said
yes
a
bit
of
fever
because
i
get
so
little
sleep
if
you
knew
how
much
i
have
thought
about
you
now
i
have
you
here
all
to
myself
and
he
spoke
of
that
persistent
odour
of
cinnamon
faint
distant
expiring
amid
the
less
definite
odours
which
her
gloves
exhaled
well
and
he
sniffed
her
fingers
you
will
leave
some
of
yourself
here
when
you
go
away
she
rose
sighing
i
see
you
have
a
cat
what
is
his
name
mouche
she
called
to
the
cat
which
fled
precipitately
mouche
mouche
durtal
called
but
mouche
took
refuge
under
the
bed
and
refused
to
come
out
you
see
he
is
rather
bashful
he
has
never
seen
a
woman
oh
would
you
try
to
make
me
think
you
have
never
received
a
woman
here
he
swore
that
he
never
had
that
she
was
the
first
and
you
were
not
really
anxious
that
this
first
should
come
he
blushed
why
do
you
say
that
she
made
a
vague
gesture
i
want
to
tease
you
she
said
sitting
down
in
the
armchair
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
know
why
i
like
to
ask
you
such
presumptuous
questions
he
had
sat
down
in
front
of
her
so
now
at
last
the
scene
was
set
as
he
wished
and
he
must
begin
the
attack
his
knee
touched
hers
you
know
he
said
that
you
can
not
presume
here
you
have
claims
on
no
i
have
and
i
want
none
why
because
listen
and
her
voice
became
grave
and
firm
the
more
i
reflect
the
more
inclined
i
am
to
ask
you
for
heaven
sake
not
to
destroy
our
dream
and
then
do
you
want
me
to
be
frank
so
frank
that
i
shall
doubtless
seem
a
monster
of
selfishness
well
personally
i
do
not
wish
to
spoil
the
the
what
shall
i
say
the
extreme
happiness
our
relation
gives
me
i
know
i
explain
badly
and
confusedly
but
this
is
the
way
it
is
i
possess
you
when
and
how
i
please
just
as
for
a
long
time
i
have
possessed
byron
baudelaire
gérard
de
nerval
those
i
love
you
mean
that
i
have
only
to
desire
them
to
desire
you
before
i
go
to
sleep
and
and
you
would
be
inferior
to
my
chimera
to
the
durtal
i
adore
whose
caresses
make
my
nights
delirious
he
looked
at
her
in
stupefaction
she
had
that
dolent
troubled
look
in
her
eyes
she
even
seemed
not
to
see
him
but
to
be
looking
into
space
he
hesitated
in
a
sudden
flash
of
thought
he
saw
the
scenes
of
incubacy
of
which
gévingey
had
spoken
we
shall
untangle
all
this
later
he
thought
within
himself
meanwhile
he
took
her
gently
by
the
arms
drew
her
to
him
and
abruptly
kissed
her
mouth
she
rebounded
as
if
she
had
had
an
electric
shock
she
struggled
to
rise
he
strained
her
to
him
and
embraced
her
furiously
then
with
a
strange
gurgling
cry
she
threw
her
head
back
and
caught
his
leg
between
both
of
hers
he
emitted
a
howl
of
rage
for
he
felt
her
haunches
move
he
understood
now
or
thought
he
understood
she
wanted
a
miserly
pleasure
a
sort
of
solitary
vice
he
pushed
her
away
she
remained
there
quite
pale
choking
her
eyes
closed
her
hands
outstretched
like
those
of
a
frightened
child
then
durtal
wrath
vanished
with
a
little
cry
he
came
up
to
her
and
caught
her
again
but
she
struggled
crying
no
i
beseech
you
let
me
go
he
held
her
crushed
against
his
body
and
attempted
to
make
her
yield
i
implore
you
let
me
go
her
accent
was
so
despairing
that
he
relinquished
her
then
he
debated
with
himself
whether
to
throw
her
brutally
on
the
floor
and
violate
her
but
her
bewildered
eyes
frightened
him
she
was
panting
and
her
arms
hung
limp
at
her
sides
as
she
leaned
very
pale
against
the
bookcase
ah
he
said
marching
up
and
down
knocking
into
the
furniture
i
must
really
love
you
if
in
spite
of
your
supplications
and
refusals
she
joined
her
hands
to
keep
him
away
good
god
he
said
exasperated
what
are
you
made
of
she
came
to
herself
and
offended
she
said
to
him
monsieur
i
too
suffer
spare
me
and
she
spoke
of
her
husband
of
her
confessor
and
became
so
incoherent
that
durtal
was
frightened
she
was
silent
then
in
a
singing
voice
she
said
tell
me
you
will
come
to
my
house
tomorrow
night
wo
you
but
i
suffer
too
she
seemed
not
to
hear
him
in
her
smoky
eyes
far
far
back
there
seemed
to
be
a
twinkle
of
feeble
light
she
murmured
in
the
cadence
of
a
canticle
tell
me
dear
you
will
come
tomorrow
night
wo
you
yes
he
said
at
last
then
she
readjusted
herself
and
without
saying
a
word
quitted
the
room
in
silence
he
accompanied
her
to
the
entrance
she
opened
the
door
turned
around
took
his
hand
and
very
lightly
brushed
it
with
her
lips
he
stood
there
stupidly
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
her
behaviour
what
does
she
mean
he
exclaimed
returning
to
the
room
putting
the
furniture
back
in
place
and
smoothing
the
disordered
carpet
heavens
i
wish
i
could
as
easily
restore
order
to
my
brain
let
me
think
if
i
can
what
is
she
after
because
of
course
she
has
something
in
view
she
does
not
want
our
relation
to
culminate
in
the
act
itself
does
she
really
fear
disillusion
as
she
claims
is
she
really
thinking
how
grotesque
the
amorous
somersaults
are
or
is
she
as
i
believe
a
melancholy
and
terrible
thinking
only
of
herself
well
her
obscene
selfishness
is
one
of
those
complicated
sins
that
have
to
be
shriven
by
the
very
highest
confessor
she
a
plain
teaser
i
do
know
incubacy
enters
into
this
she
admits
so
placidly
that
in
dream
she
cohabits
at
will
with
dead
or
living
beings
is
she
satanizing
and
is
this
some
of
the
work
of
canon
docre
he
a
friend
of
hers
so
many
riddles
impossible
to
solve
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
unexpected
invitation
for
tomorrow
night
does
she
wish
to
yield
nowhere
except
in
her
own
home
does
she
feel
more
at
ease
there
or
does
she
think
the
propinquity
of
her
husband
will
render
the
sin
more
piquant
does
she
loathe
chantelouve
and
is
this
a
meditated
vengeance
or
does
she
count
on
the
fear
of
danger
to
spur
our
senses
after
all
i
think
it
is
probably
a
final
coquetry
an
appetizer
before
the
repast
and
women
are
so
funny
anyway
she
probably
thinks
these
delays
and
subterfuges
are
necessary
to
differentiate
her
from
a
cocotte
or
perhaps
there
is
a
physical
necessity
for
stalling
me
off
another
day
he
sought
other
reasons
but
could
find
none
deep
down
in
my
heart
he
said
vexed
in
spite
of
himself
by
this
rebuff
i
know
i
have
been
an
imbecile
i
ought
to
have
acted
the
cave
man
and
paid
no
attention
to
her
supplications
and
lies
i
ought
to
have
taken
violent
possession
of
her
lips
and
breast
then
it
would
be
finished
whereas
now
i
must
begin
at
the
beginning
again
and
god
damn
her
i
have
other
things
to
do
who
knows
whether
she
is
laughing
at
me
this
very
moment
perhaps
she
wanted
me
to
be
more
violent
and
bold
but
no
her
voice
was
not
feigned
her
poor
eyes
did
not
simulate
bewilderment
and
then
what
would
she
have
meant
by
that
kiss
for
there
was
an
impalpable
shade
of
respect
and
gratitude
in
that
kiss
which
she
planted
on
my
hand
she
was
too
much
for
him
meanwhile
in
this
i
have
forgotten
my
refreshments
suppose
i
take
off
my
shoes
now
that
i
am
alone
for
my
feet
are
swollen
from
parading
up
and
down
the
room
suppose
i
do
better
yet
and
go
to
bed
for
i
am
incapable
of
working
or
reading
and
he
drew
back
the
covers
decidedly
nothing
happens
the
way
one
foresees
it
yet
my
plan
of
attack
was
badly
thought
out
he
said
crawling
in
with
a
sigh
he
blew
out
the
lamp
and
the
cat
reassured
passed
over
him
lighter
than
a
breath
and
curled
up
without
a
sound
chapter
xi
contrary
to
his
expectations
he
slept
all
night
with
clenched
fists
and
woke
next
morning
quite
calm
even
gay
the
scene
of
the
night
before
which
ought
to
have
exacerbated
his
senses
produced
exactly
the
opposite
effect
the
truth
is
that
durtal
was
not
of
those
who
are
attracted
by
difficulties
he
always
made
one
hardy
effort
to
surmount
them
then
when
that
failed
he
would
withdraw
with
no
desire
to
renew
the
combat
if
mme
chantelouve
thought
to
entice
him
by
delays
she
had
miscalculated
this
morning
already
he
was
weary
of
the
comedy
his
reflections
began
to
be
slightly
tinged
with
bitterness
he
was
angry
at
the
woman
for
having
wished
to
keep
him
in
suspense
and
he
was
angry
at
himself
for
having
permitted
her
to
make
a
fool
of
him
then
certain
expressions
the
impertinence
of
which
had
not
struck
him
at
first
chilled
him
now
her
nervous
trick
of
laughing
which
sometimes
caught
her
in
public
places
then
her
declaration
that
she
did
not
need
his
permission
nor
even
his
person
in
order
to
possess
him
seemed
to
him
unbecoming
to
say
the
least
and
uncalled
for
as
he
had
not
run
after
her
nor
indeed
made
any
advances
to
her
at
all
i
will
fix
you
he
said
when
i
get
some
hold
over
you
but
in
the
calm
awakening
of
this
morning
the
spell
of
the
woman
had
relaxed
resolutely
he
thought
keep
two
dates
with
her
this
one
tonight
at
her
house
it
wo
count
because
nothing
can
be
done
for
i
intend
neither
to
allow
myself
to
be
assaulted
nor
to
attempt
an
assault
i
certainly
have
no
desire
to
be
caught
by
chantelouve
flagrante
and
probably
get
into
a
shooting
scrape
and
be
haled
into
police
court
have
her
here
once
if
she
does
not
yield
then
why
the
matter
is
closed
she
can
go
and
tickle
somebody
else
and
he
made
a
hearty
breakfast
and
sat
down
to
his
writing
table
and
ran
over
the
scattered
notes
for
his
book
i
had
got
he
said
glancing
at
his
last
chapter
to
where
the
alchemic
experiments
and
diabolic
evocations
have
proved
unavailing
prelati
blanchet
all
the
sorcerers
and
sorcerers
helpers
whom
the
marshal
has
about
him
admit
that
to
bring
satan
to
him
gilles
must
make
over
his
soul
and
body
to
the
devil
or
commit
crimes
gilles
refuses
to
alienate
his
existence
and
sell
his
soul
but
he
contemplates
murder
without
any
horror
this
man
so
brave
on
the
battlefield
so
courageous
when
he
accompanied
jeanne
trembles
before
the
devil
and
is
afraid
when
he
thinks
of
eternity
and
of
christ
the
same
is
true
of
his
accomplices
he
has
made
them
swear
on
the
testament
to
keep
the
secret
of
the
confounding
turpitudes
which
the
château
conceals
and
he
can
be
sure
that
not
one
will
violate
the
oath
for
in
the
middle
ages
the
most
reckless
of
freebooters
would
not
commit
the
inexpiable
sin
of
deceiving
god
at
the
same
time
that
his
alchemists
abandon
their
unfruitful
furnaces
gilles
begins
a
course
of
systematic
gluttony
and
his
flesh
set
on
fire
by
the
essences
of
inordinate
potations
and
spiced
dishes
seethes
in
tumultuous
eruption
now
there
are
no
women
in
the
château
gilles
appears
to
have
despised
the
sex
ever
since
leaving
the
court
after
experience
of
the
ribalds
of
the
camps
and
frequentation
with
xaintrailles
and
la
hire
of
the
prostitutes
of
charles
vii
it
seems
that
a
dislike
for
the
feminine
form
came
over
him
like
others
whose
ideal
of
concupiscence
is
deteriorated
and
deviated
he
certainly
comes
to
be
disgusted
by
the
delicacy
of
the
grain
of
the
skin
of
women
and
by
that
odour
of
femininity
which
all
sodomists
abhor
he
depraves
the
choir
boys
who
are
under
his
authority
he
chose
them
in
the
first
place
these
little
psaltry
ministrants
for
their
beauty
and
as
angels
they
are
they
are
the
only
ones
he
loves
the
only
ones
he
spares
in
his
murderous
transports
but
soon
infantile
pollution
seems
to
him
an
insipid
delicacy
the
law
of
satanism
which
demands
that
the
elect
of
evil
once
started
must
go
the
whole
way
is
once
more
fulfilled
gilles
soul
must
become
thoroughly
cankered
a
red
tabernacle
that
in
it
the
very
low
may
dwell
at
ease
the
litanies
of
lust
arise
in
an
atmosphere
that
is
like
the
wind
over
a
slaughter
house
the
first
victim
is
a
very
small
boy
whose
name
we
do
not
know
gilles
disembowels
him
and
cutting
off
the
hands
and
tearing
out
the
eyes
and
heart
carries
these
members
into
prelati
chamber
the
two
men
offer
them
with
passionate
objurgations
to
the
devil
who
holds
his
peace
gilles
confounded
flees
prelati
rolls
up
the
poor
remains
in
linen
and
trembling
goes
out
at
night
to
bury
them
in
consecrated
ground
beside
a
chapel
dedicated
to
saint
vincent
gilles
preserves
the
blood
of
this
child
to
write
formulas
of
evocation
and
conjurements
it
manures
a
horrible
crop
not
long
afterward
the
marshal
reaps
the
most
abundant
harvest
of
crimes
that
has
ever
been
sown
from
to
that
is
to
say

the

the
son
of

this
was
a
poor
man
and
sought

lost
at
mâchecoul
the
son
of
georget
le

was
seen
a
certain
day
knocking
apples
from
a
tree
behind
the

and
who
since
hath
not
been
seen
lost
at

the
child
of

he
had
been
heard
to
cry
and
lament
and
the
said

was
about
twelve
years
of
age
at
mâchecoul
again
the
day
of
pentecost
mother
and
father
sergent
leave
their
boy
at
home
and
when
they
return
from
the
fields
did
not
find
the
said
child
of
eight
years
of
age
wherefore
they
marvelled
and
were
exceeding
grieved
at
chantelou
it
is
pierre
badieu
mercer
of
the
parish
who
says
that
a
year
or
thereabouts
ago
he
saw
in
the
domain
de
rais
little
children
of
the
age
of
nine
who
were
brothers
and
the
children
of
robin
pavot
of
the
aforesaid
place
and
since
that
time
neither
have
they
been
seen
neither
doth
any
know
what
hath
become
of
them
at
nantes
it
is
jeanne
darel
who
deposes
that
the
day
of
the
feast
of
the
holy
father
her
true
child
named
olivier
did
stray
from
her
being
of
the
age
of
seven
and
eight
years
and
since
the
day
of
the
feast
of
the
holy
father
neither
did
she
see
him
nor
hear
tidings
and
the
account
of
the
investigation
goes
on
revealing
hundreds
of
names
describing
the
grief
of
the
mothers
who
interrogate
passersby
on
the
highway
and
telling
of
the
keening
of
the
families
from
whose
very
homes
children
have
been
spirited
away
when
the
elders
went
to
the
fields
to
hoe
or
to
sow
the
hemp
these
phrases
like
a
desolate
refrain
recur
again
and
again
at
the
end
of
every
deposition
were
seen
complaining
dolorously
they
did
lament
wherever
the
bloodthirsty
gilles
dwells
the
women
weep
at
first
the
frantic
people
tell
themselves
that
evil
fairies
and
malicious
genii
are
dispersing
the
generation
but
little
by
little
terrible
suspicions
are
aroused
as
soon
as
the
marshal
quits
a
place
as
he
goes
from
the
château
de
tiffauges
to
the
château
de
champtocé
and
from
there
to
the
castle
of
la
suze
or
to
nantes
he
leaves
behind
him
a
wake
of
tears
he
traverses
a
countryside
and
in
the
morning
children
are
missing
trembling
the
peasant
realizes
also
that
wherever
prelati
roger
de
bricqueville
gilles
de
sillé
any
of
the
intimates
have
shown
themselves
little
boys
have
disappeared
finally
the
peasant
learns
to
look
with
horror
upon
an
old
woman
perrine
martin
who
wanders
around
clad
in
grey
her
face
covered
as
is
that
of
gilles
de
sillé
with
a
black
stamin
she
accosts
children
and
her
speech
is
so
seductive
her
face
when
she
raises
her
veil
so
benign
that
all
follow
her
to
the
edge
of
a
wood
where
men
carry
them
off
gagged
in
sacks
and
the
frightened
people
call
this
purveyor
of
flesh
this
ogress
mefrraye
from
the
name
of
a
bird
of
prey
these
emissaries
spread
out
covering
all
the
villages
and
hamlets
tracking
the
children
down
at
the
orders
of
the
chief
huntsman
the
sire
de
bricqueville
not
content
with
these
beaters
gilles
takes
to
standing
at
a
window
of
the
château
and
when
young
mendicants
attracted
by
the
renown
of
his
bounty
ask
an
alms
he
runs
an
appraising
eye
over
them
has
any
who
excite
his
lust
brought
in
and
thrown
into
an
underground
prison
and
kept
there
until
being
in
appetite
he
is
pleased
to
order
a
carnal
supper
how
many
children
did
he
disembowel
after
deflowering
them
he
himself
did
not
know
so
many
were
the
rapes
he
had
consummated
and
the
murders
he
had
committed
the
texts
of
the
times
enumerate
between
seven
and
eight
hundred
but
the
estimate
is
inaccurate
and
seems
overconservative
entire
regions
were
devastated
the
hamlet
of
tiffauges
had
no
more
young
men
la
suze
was
without
male
posterity
at
champtocé
the
whole
foundation
room
of
a
tower
was
filled
with
corpses
a
witness
cited
in
the
inquest
guillaume
hylairet
declared
also
that
one
hight
du
jardin
hath
heard
say
that
there
was
found
in
the
said
castle
a
wine
pipe
full
of
dead
little
children
even
today
traces
of
these
assassinations
linger
two
years
ago
at
tiffauges
a
physician
discovered
an
oubliette
and
brought
forth
piles
of
skulls
and
bones
gilles
confessed
to
frightful
holocausts
and
his
friends
confirmed
the
atrocious
details
at
dusk
when
their
senses
are
phosphorescent
enkindled
by
inflammatory
spiced
beverages
and
by
venison
gilles
and
his
friends
retire
to
a
distant
chamber
of
the
château
the
little
boys
are
brought
from
their
cellar
prisons
to
this
room
they
are
disrobed
and
gagged
the
marshal
fondles
them
and
forces
them
then
he
hacks
them
to
pieces
with
a
dagger
taking
great
pleasure
in
slowly
dismembering
them
at
other
times
he
slashes
the
boy
chest
and
drinks
the
breath
from
the
lungs
sometimes
he
opens
the
stomach
also
smells
it
enlarges
the
incision
with
his
hands
and
seats
himself
in
it
then
while
he
macerates
the
warm
entrails
in
mud
he
turns
half
around
and
looks
over
his
shoulder
to
contemplate
the
supreme
convulsions
the
last
spasms
he
himself
says
afterwards
was
happier
in
the
enjoyment
of
tortures
tears
fright
and
blood
than
in
any
other
pleasure
then
he
becomes
weary
of
these
fecal
joys
an
unpublished
passage
in
his
trial
proceedings
informs
us
that
said
sire
heated
himself
with
little
boys
sometimes
also
with
little
girls
with
whom
he
had
congress
in
the
belly
saying
that
he
had
more
pleasure
and
less
pain
than
acting
in
nature
after
which
he
slowly
saws
their
throats
cuts
them
to
pieces
and
the
corpses
the
linen
and
the
clothing
are
put
in
the
fireplace
where
a
smudge
fire
of
logs
and
leaves
is
burning
and
the
ashes
are
thrown
into
the
latrine
or
scattered
to
the
winds
from
the
top
of
a
tower
or
buried
in
the
moats
and
mounds
soon
his
furies
become
aggravated
until
now
he
has
appeased
the
rage
of
his
senses
with
living
or
moribund
beings
he
wearies
of
stuprating
palpitant
flesh
and
becomes
a
lover
of
the
dead
a
passionate
artist
he
kisses
with
cries
of
enthusiasm
the
limbs
of
his
victims
he
establishes
sepulchral
beauty
contests
and
whichever
of
the
truncated
heads
receives
the
prize
he
raises
by
the
hair
and
passionately
kisses
the
cold
lips
vampirism
satisfies
him
for
months
he
pollutes
dead
children
appeasing
the
fever
of
his
desires
in
the
blood
smeared
chill
of
the
tomb
he
even
goes
so
far
one
day
when
his
supply
of
children
is
exhausted
as
to
disembowel
a
pregnant
woman
and
sport
with
the
foetus
after
these
excesses
he
falls
into
horrible
states
of
coma
similar
to
those
heavy
lethargies
which
overpowered
sergeant
bertrand
after
his
violations
of
the
grave
but
if
that
leaden
sleep
is
one
of
the
known
phases
of
ordinary
vampirism
if
gilles
de
rais
was
merely
a
sexual
pervert
we
must
admit
that
he
distinguished
himself
from
the
most
delirious
sadists
the
most
exquisite
virtuosi
in
pain
and
murder
by
a
detail
which
seems
extrahuman
it
is
so
horrible
as
these
terrifying
atrocities
these
monstrous
outrages
no
longer
suffice
him
he
corrodes
them
with
the
essence
of
a
rare
sin
it
is
no
longer
the
resolute
sagacious
cruelty
of
the
wild
beast
playing
with
the
body
of
a
victim
his
ferocity
does
not
remain
merely
carnal
it
becomes
spiritual
he
wishes
to
make
the
child
suffer
both
in
body
and
soul
by
a
thoroughly
satanic
cheat
he
deceives
gratitude
dupes
affection
and
desecrates
love
at
a
leap
he
passes
the
bounds
of
human
infamy
and
lands
plump
in
the
darkest
depth
of
evil
he
contrives
this
one
of
the
unfortunate
children
is
brought
into
his
chamber
and
hanged
by
bricqueville
prelati
and
de
sillé
to
a
hook
fixed
into
the
wall
just
at
the
moment
when
the
child
is
suffocating
gilles
orders
him
to
be
taken
down
and
the
rope
untied
with
some
precaution
he
takes
the
child
on
his
knees
revives
him
caresses
him
rocks
him
dries
his
tears
and
pointing
to
the
accomplices
says
men
are
bad
but
you
see
they
obey
me
do
not
be
afraid
i
will
save
your
life
and
take
you
back
to
your
mother
and
while
the
little
one
wild
with
joy
kisses
him
and
at
that
moment
loves
him
gilles
gently
makes
an
incision
in
the
back
of
the
neck
rendering
the
child
to
follow
gilles
own
expression
and
when
the
head
not
quite
detached
bows
gilles
kneads
the
body
turns
it
about
and
violates
it
bellowing
after
these
abominable
pastimes
he
may
well
believe
that
the
art
of
the
charnalist
has
beneath
his
fingers
expressed
its
last
drop
of
pus
and
in
a
vaunting
cry
he
says
to
his
troop
of
parasites
there
is
no
man
on
earth
who
dare
do
as
i
have
done
but
if
in
love
and
the
infinite
is
approachable
for
certain
souls
the
possibilities
of
evil
are
limited
in
his
excesses
of
stupration
and
murder
the
marshal
can
not
go
beyond
a
fixed
point
in
vain
he
may
dream
of
unique
violations
of
more
ingenious
slow
tortures
but
human
imagination
has
a
limit
and
he
has
already
reached
it
even
passed
it
with
diabolic
aid
insatiable
he
seethes
there
is
nothing
material
in
which
to
express
his
ideal
he
can
verify
that
axiom
of
demonographers
that
the
evil
one
dupes
all
persons
who
give
themselves
or
are
willing
to
give
themselves
to
him
as
he
can
descend
no
further
he
tries
returning
on
the
way
by
which
he
has
come
but
now
remorse
overtakes
him
overwhelms
him
and
wrenches
him
without
respite
his
nights
are
nights
of
expiation
besieged
by
phantoms
he
howls
like
a
wounded
beast
he
is
found
rushing
along
the
solitary
corridors
of
the
château
he
weeps
throws
himself
on
his
knees
swears
to
god
that
he
will
do
penance
he
promises
to
found
pious
institutions
he
does
establish
at
mâchecoul
a
boys
academy
in
honour
of
the
holy
innocents
he
speaks
of
shutting
himself
up
in
a
cloister
of
going
to
jerusalem
begging
his
bread
on
the
way
but
in
this
fickle
and
aberrated
mind
ideas
superpose
themselves
on
each
other
then
pass
away
and
those
which
disappear
leave
their
shadow
on
those
which
follow
abruptly
even
while
weeping
with
distress
he
precipitates
himself
into
new
debauches
and
raving
with
delirium
hurls
himself
upon
the
child
brought
to
him
gouges
out
the
eyes
runs
his
finger
around
the
bloody
milky
socket
then
he
seizes
a
spiked
club
and
crushes
the
skull
and
while
the
gurgling
blood
runs
over
him
he
stands
smeared
with
spattered
brains
and
grinds
his
teeth
and
laughs
like
a
hunted
beast
he
flees
into
the
wood
while
his
henchmen
remove
the
crimson
stains
from
the
ground
and
dispose
prudently
of
the
corpse
and
the
reeking
garments
he
wanders
in
the
forests
surrounding
tiffauges
dark
impenetrable
forests
like
those
which
brittany
still
can
show
at
carnoet
he
sobs
as
he
walks
along
he
attempts
to
thrust
aside
the
phantoms
which
accost
him
then
he
looks
about
him
and
beholds
obscenity
in
the
shapes
of
the
aged
trees
it
seems
that
nature
perverts
itself
before
him
that
his
very
presence
depraves
it
for
the
first
time
he
understands
the
motionless
lubricity
of
trees
he
discovers
priapi
in
the
branches
here
a
tree
appears
to
him
as
a
living
being
standing
on
its
head
its
limbs
waving
in
the
air
and
spread
wide
apart
subdivided
and
into
haunches
which
again
are
divided
and
here
between
two
limbs
another
branch
is
jammed
in
a
stationary
fornication
which
is
reproduced
in
diminished
scale
from
bough
to
twig
to
the
top
of
the
tree
there
it
seems
the
trunk
is
a
phallus
which
mounts
and
disappears
into
a
skirt
of
leaves
or
which
on
the
contrary
issues
from
a
green
clout
and
plunges
into
the
glossy
belly
of
the
earth
frightful
images
rise
before
him
he
sees
the
skin
of
little
boys
the
lucid
white
skin
in
the
pale
smooth
bark
of
the
slender
beeches
he
recognizes
the
pachydermatous
skin
of
the
beggar
boys
in
the
dark
and
wrinkled
envelope
of
the
old
oaks
beside
the
bifurcations
of
the
branches
there
are
yawning
holes
puckered
orifices
in
the
bark
simulating
emunctoria
or
the
protruding
anus
of
a
beast
in
the
joints
of
the
branches
there
are
other
visions
elbows
armpits
furred
with
grey
lichens
even
in
the
trunks
there
are
incisions
which
spread
out
into
great
lips
beneath
tufts
of
brown
velvety
moss
everywhere
obscene
forms
rise
from
the
ground
and
spring
disordered
into
a
firmament
which
satanizes
the
clouds
swell
into
breasts
divide
into
buttocks
bulge
as
if
with
fecundity
scattering
a
train
of
spawn
through
space
they
accord
with
the
sombre
bulging
of
the
foliage
in
which
now
there
are
only
images
of
giant
or
dwarf
hips
feminine
triangles
great
v
mouths
of
sodom
glowing
cicatrices
humid
vents
this
landscape
of
abomination
changes
gilles
now
sees
on
the
trunks
frightful
cancers
and
horrible
wens
he
observes
exostoses
and
ulcers
membranous
sores
tubercular
chancres
atrocious
caries
it
is
an
arboreal
lazaret
a
venereal
clinic
and
there
at
a
detour
of
the
forest
aisle
stands
a
mottled
red
beech
amid
the
sanguinary
falling
leaves
he
feels
that
he
has
been
spattered
by
a
shower
of
blood
he
goes
into
a
rage
he
conceives
the
delusion
that
beneath
the
bark
lives
a
wood
nymph
and
he
would
feel
with
his
hands
the
palpitant
flesh
of
the
goddess
he
would
trucidate
the
dryad
violate
her
in
a
place
unknown
to
the
follies
of
men
he
is
jealous
of
the
woodman
who
can
murder
can
massacre
the
trees
and
he
raves
tensely
he
listens
and
hears
in
the
soughing
wind
a
response
to
his
cries
of
desire
overwhelmed
he
resumes
his
walk
weeping
until
he
arrives
at
the
château
and
sinks
to
his
bed
exhausted
an
inert
mass
the
phantoms
take
more
definite
shape
now
that
he
sleeps
the
lubric
enlacements
of
the
branches
dilated
crevices
and
cleft
mosses
the
coupling
of
the
diverse
beings
of
the
wood
disappear
the
tears
of
the
leaves
whipped
by
the
wind
are
dried
the
white
abscesses
of
the
clouds
are
resorbed
into
the
grey
of
the
sky
and
in
an
awful
silence
the
incubi
and
succubi
pass
the
corpses
of
his
victims
reduced
to
ashes
and
scattered
return
to
the
larva
state
and
attack
his
lower
parts
he
writhes
with
the
blood
bursting
his
veins
he
rebounds
in
a
somersault
then
he
crawls
to
the
crucifix
like
a
wolf
on
all
fours
and
howling
strains
his
lips
to
the
feet
of
the
christ
a
sudden
reaction
overwhelms
him
he
trembles
before
the
image
whose
convulsed
face
looks
down
on
him
he
adjures
christ
to
have
pity
supplicates
him
to
spare
a
sinner
and
sobs
and
weeps
and
when
incapable
of
further
effort
he
whimpers
he
hears
terrified
in
his
own
voice
the
lamentations
of
the
children
crying
for
their
mothers
and
pleading
for
mercy
and
durtal
coming
slowly
out
of
the
vision
he
had
conjured
up
closed
his
notebook
and
remarked
rather
petty
my
own
spiritual
conflict
regarding
a
woman
whose
sin
like
my
own
to
be
sure
is
commonplace
and
bourgeois
chapter
xii
easy
to
find
an
excuse
for
this
visit
though
it
will
seem
strange
to
chantelouve
whom
i
have
neglected
for
months
said
durtal
on
his
way
toward
the
rue
bagneux
supposing
he
is
home
this
evening
and
he
probably
is
because
surely
hyacinthe
will
have
seen
to
that
i
can
tell
him
that
i
have
learned
of
his
illness
through
des
hermies
and
that
i
have
come
to
see
how
he
is
getting
along
he
paused
on
the
stoop
of
the
building
in
which
chantelouve
lived
at
each
side
and
over
the
door
were
these
antique
lamps
with
reflectors
surmounted
by
a
sort
of
casque
of
sheet
iron
painted
green
there
was
an
old
iron
balustrade
very
wide
and
the
steps
with
wooden
sides
were
paved
with
red
tile
about
this
house
there
was
a
sepulchral
and
also
clerical
odour
yet
there
was
also
something
homelike
though
a
little
too
imposing
about
it
such
as
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
cardboard
houses
they
build
nowadays
you
could
see
at
a
glance
that
it
did
not
harbour
the
apartment
house
promiscuities
decent
respectable
couples
with
kept
women
for
neighbours
the
house
pleased
him
and
he
considered
hyacinthe
the
more
desirable
for
her
substantial
environment
he
rang
at
a
apartment
a
maid
led
him
through
a
long
hall
into
a
he
noticed
at
a
glance
that
nothing
had
changed
since
his
last
visit
it
was
the
same
vast
room
with
windows
reaching
to
heaven
there
was
the
huge
fireplace
on
the
mantelpiece
the
same
reproduction
reduced
in
bronze
of
jeanne
between
the
two
globe
lamps
of
japanese
porcelain
he
recognized
the
grand
piano
the
table
loaded
with
albums
the
divan
the
chairs
in
the
style
of
louis
xv
with
tapestried
covers
in
front
of
every
window
there
were
imitation
chinese
vases
mounted
on
tripods
of
imitation
ebony
and
containing
sickly
palms
on
the
walls
were
religious
pictures
without
expression
and
a
portrait
of
chantelouve
in
his
youth
length
his
hand
resting
on
a
pile
of
his
works
an
ancient
russian
icon
in
nielloed
silver
and
one
of
these
christs
in
carved
wood
executed
in
the
seventeenth
century
by
bogard
de
nancy
in
an
antique
frame
of
gilded
wood
backed
with
velvet
were
the
only
things
that
slightly
relieved
the
banality
of
the
decoration
the
rest
of
the
furniture
looked
like
that
of
a
bourgeois
household
fixed
up
for
lent
or
for
a
charity
dance
or
for
a
visit
from
the
priest
a
great
fire
blazed
on
the
hearth
the
room
was
lighted
by
a
very
high
lamp
with
a
wide
shade
of
pink
lace
stinks
of
the
sacristy
durtal
was
saying
to
himself
at
the
moment
the
door
opened
mme
chantelouve
entered
the
lines
of
her
figure
advantageously
displayed
by
a
wrapper
of
white
swanskin
which
gave
off
a
fragrance
of
frangipane
she
pressed
durtal
hand
and
sat
down
facing
him
and
he
perceived
under
the
wrap
her
indigo
silk
stockings
in
little
patent
leather
bootines
with
straps
across
the
insteps
they
talked
about
the
weather
she
complained
of
the
way
the
winter
hung
on
and
declared
that
although
the
furnace
seemed
to
be
working
all
right
she
was
always
shivering
was
always
frozen
to
death
she
told
him
to
feel
her
hands
which
indeed
were
cold
then
she
seemed
worried
about
his
health
you
look
pale
she
said
you
might
at
least
say
that
i
pale
he
replied
she
did
not
answer
immediately
then
yesterday
i
saw
how
much
you
desire
me
she
said
but
why
why
want
to
go
so
far
he
made
a
gesture
indicating
vague
annoyance
how
funny
you
are
she
went
on
i
was
one
of
your
books
today
and
i
noticed
this
phrase
only
women
you
can
continue
to
love
are
those
you
lose
now
admit
that
you
were
right
when
you
wrote
that
it
all
depends
i
was
in
love
then
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
well
she
said
i
must
tell
my
husband
you
are
here
durtal
remained
silent
wondering
what
rôle
chantelouve
actually
played
in
this
triangle
chantelouve
returned
with
his
wife
he
was
in
his
and
had
a
pen
in
his
mouth
he
took
it
out
and
put
it
on
the
table
and
after
assuring
durtal
that
his
health
was
completely
restored
he
complained
of
overwhelming
labours
i
have
had
to
quit
giving
dinners
and
receptions
he
said
i
ca
even
go
visiting
i
am
in
harness
every
day
at
my
desk
and
when
durtal
asked
him
the
nature
of
these
labours
he
confessed
to
a
whole
series
of
unsigned
volumes
on
the
lives
of
the
saints
to
be
turned
out
by
the
gross
by
a
tours
firm
for
exportation
yes
said
his
wife
laughing
and
these
are
saints
whose
biographies
he
is
preparing
and
as
durtal
looked
at
him
inquiringly
chantelouve
also
laughing
said
it
was
their
persons
that
were
the
subjects
are
chosen
for
me
and
it
does
seem
as
if
the
publisher
enjoyed
making
me
eulogize
frowziness
i
have
to
describe
blessed
saints
most
of
whom
were
deplorably
unkempt
labre
who
was
so
lousy
and
as
to
disgust
the
beasts
in
the
stables
saint
cunegonde
who
humility
neglected
her
body
saint
oportune
who
never
used
water
and
who
washed
her
bed
only
with
her
tears
saint
silvia
who
never
removed
the
grime
from
her
face
saint
radegonde
who
never
changed
her
hair
shirt
and
who
slept
on
a
cinder
pile
and
how
many
others
around
whose
heads
i
must
draw
a
golden
halo
there
are
worse
than
those
said
durtal
read
the
life
of
marie
alacoque
you
will
see
that
she
to
mortify
herself
licked
up
with
her
tongue
the
dejections
of
one
sick
person
and
sucked
an
abscess
from
the
toe
of
another
i
know
but
i
must
admit
that
i
am
less
touched
than
revolted
by
these
tales
i
prefer
saint
lucius
the
martyr
said
mme
chantelouve
his
body
was
so
transparent
that
he
could
see
through
his
chest
the
vileness
of
his
heart
his
kind
of
at
least
we
can
stand
but
i
must
admit
that
this
utter
disregard
of
cleanliness
makes
me
suspicious
of
the
monasteries
and
renders
your
beloved
middle
ages
odious
to
me
pardon
me
my
dear
said
her
husband
you
are
greatly
mistaken
the
middle
ages
were
not
as
you
believe
an
epoch
of
uncleanliness
people
frequented
the
baths
assiduously
at
paris
for
example
where
these
establishments
were
numerous
the
went
about
the
city
announcing
that
the
water
was
hot
it
is
not
until
the
renaissance
that
uncleanliness
becomes
rife
in
france
when
you
think
that
that
delicious
reine
margot
kept
her
body
macerated
with
perfumes
but
as
grimy
as
the
inside
of
a
stovepipe
and
that
henri
quatre
plumed
himself
on
having
feet
and
a
fine
armpit
my
dear
for
heaven
sake
said
madame
spare
us
the
details
while
chantelouve
was
speaking
durtal
was
watching
him
he
was
small
and
rotund
with
a
bay
window
which
his
arms
would
not
have
gone
around
he
had
rubicund
cheeks
long
hair
very
much
pomaded
trailing
in
the
back
and
drawn
up
in
crescents
along
his
temples
he
had
pink
cotton
in
his
ears
he
was
smooth
shaven
and
looked
like
a
pious
but
convivial
notary
but
his
quick
calculating
eye
belied
his
jovial
and
sugary
mien
one
divined
in
his
look
the
cool
unscrupulous
man
of
affairs
capable
for
all
his
honeyed
ways
of
doing
one
a
bad
turn
he
must
be
aching
to
throw
me
into
the
street
said
durtal
to
himself
because
he
certainly
knows
all
about
his
wife
but
if
chantelouve
wished
to
be
rid
of
his
guest
he
did
not
show
it
with
his
legs
crossed
and
his
hands
folded
one
over
the
other
in
the
attitude
of
a
priest
he
appeared
to
be
mightily
interested
in
work
inclining
a
little
listening
as
if
in
a
theatre
he
said
yes
i
know
the
material
on
the
subject
i
read
a
book
some
time
ago
about
gilles
de
rais
which
seemed
to
me
well
handled
it
was
by
abbé
bossard
it
is
the
most
complete
and
reliable
of
the
biographies
of
the
marshal
but
chantelouve
went
on
there
is
one
point
which
i
never
have
been
able
to
understand
i
have
never
been
able
to
explain
to
myself
why
the
name
bluebeard
should
have
been
attached
to
the
marshal
whose
history
certainly
has
no
relation
to
the
tale
of
the
good
perrault
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
real
bluebeard
was
not
gilles
de
rais
but
probably
a
breton
king
comor
a
fragment
of
whose
castle
dating
from
the
sixth
century
is
still
standing
on
the
confines
of
the
forest
of
carnoet
the
legend
is
simple
the
king
asked
guerock
count
of
vannes
for
the
hand
of
his
daughter
triphine
guerock
refused
because
he
had
heard
that
the
king
maintained
himself
in
a
constant
state
of
widowerhood
by
cutting
his
wives
throats
finally
saint
gildas
promised
guerock
to
return
his
daughter
to
him
safe
and
sound
when
he
should
reclaim
her
and
the
union
was
celebrated
some
months
later
triphine
learned
that
comor
did
indeed
kill
his
consorts
as
soon
as
they
became
pregnant
she
was
big
with
child
so
she
fled
but
her
husband
pursued
her
and
cut
her
throat
the
weeping
father
commanded
saint
gildas
to
keep
his
promise
and
the
saint
resuscitated
triphine
as
you
see
this
legend
comes
much
nearer
than
the
history
of
our
bluebeard
to
the
told
tale
arranged
by
the
ingenious
perrault
now
why
and
how
the
name
bluebeard
passed
from
king
comor
to
the
marshal
de
rais
i
can
not
tell
you
know
what
pranks
oral
tradition
can
play
but
with
your
gilles
de
rais
you
must
have
to
plunge
into
satanism
right
up
to
the
hilt
said
chantelouve
after
a
silence
yes
and
it
would
really
be
more
interesting
if
these
scenes
were
not
so
remote
what
would
have
a
timely
appeal
would
be
a
study
of
the
diabolism
of
the
present
day
no
doubt
said
chantelouve
pleasantly
for
durtal
went
on
looking
at
him
intently
things
are
going
on
right
now
i
have
heard
tell
of
sacrilegious
priests
of
a
certain
canon
who
has
revived
the
sabbats
of
the
middle
ages
chantelouve
did
not
betray
himself
by
so
much
as
a
flicker
of
the
eyelids
calmly
he
uncrossed
his
legs
and
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
he
said
alas
certain
scabby
wethers
succeed
in
stealing
into
the
fold
but
they
are
so
rare
as
hardly
to
be
worth
thinking
about
and
he
deftly
changed
the
subject
by
speaking
of
a
book
he
had
just
read
about
the
fronde
durtal
somewhat
embarrassed
said
nothing
he
understood
that
chantelouve
refused
to
speak
of
his
relations
with
canon
docre
my
dear
said
mme
chantelouve
addressing
her
husband
you
have
forgotten
to
turn
up
your
lamp
wick
it
is
smoking
i
can
smell
it
from
here
even
through
the
closed
door
she
was
most
evidently
conveying
him
a
dismissal
chantelouve
rose
and
with
a
vaguely
malicious
smile
excused
himself
as
being
obliged
to
continue
his
work
he
shook
hands
with
durtal
begged
him
not
to
stay
away
so
long
in
future
and
gathering
up
the
skirts
of
his
he
left
the
room
she
followed
him
with
her
eyes
then
rose
in
her
turn
ran
to
the
door
assured
herself
with
a
glance
that
it
was
closed
then
returned
to
durtal
who
was
leaning
against
the
mantel
without
a
word
she
took
his
head
between
her
hands
pressed
her
lips
to
his
mouth
and
opened
it
he
grunted
furiously
she
looked
at
him
with
indolent
and
filmy
eyes
and
he
saw
sparks
of
silver
dart
to
their
surface
he
held
her
in
his
arms
she
was
swooning
but
vigilantly
listening
gently
she
disengaged
herself
sighing
while
he
embarrassed
sat
down
at
a
little
distance
from
her
clenching
and
unclenching
his
hands
they
spoke
of
banal
things
she
boasting
of
her
maid
who
would
go
through
fire
for
her
he
responding
only
by
gestures
of
approbation
and
surprise
then
suddenly
she
passed
her
hands
over
her
forehead
ah
she
said
i
suffer
cruelly
when
i
think
that
he
is
there
working
no
it
would
cost
me
too
much
remorse
what
i
say
is
foolish
but
if
he
were
a
different
man
a
man
who
went
out
more
and
made
conquests
it
would
not
be
so
bad
he
was
irritated
by
the
inconsequentiality
of
her
plaints
finally
feeling
completely
safe
he
came
closer
to
her
and
said
you
spoke
of
remorse
but
whether
we
embark
or
whether
we
stand
on
the
bank
our
guilt
exactly
the
same
yes
i
know
my
confessor
talks
to
me
like
that
only
more
severely
but
i
think
you
are
both
wrong
he
could
not
help
laughing
and
he
said
to
himself
remorse
is
perhaps
the
condiment
which
keeps
passion
from
being
too
unappetizing
to
the
blasé
then
aloud
he
jestingly
speaking
of
confessors
if
i
were
a
casuist
it
seems
to
me
i
would
try
to
invent
new
sins
i
am
not
a
casuist
and
yet
having
looked
about
a
bit
i
believe
i
found
a
new
sin
you
she
said
laughing
in
turn
can
i
commit
it
he
scrutinized
her
features
she
had
the
expression
of
a
greedy
child
you
alone
can
answer
that
now
i
must
admit
that
the
sin
is
not
absolutely
new
for
it
fits
into
the
known
category
of
lust
but
it
has
been
neglected
since
pagan
days
and
was
never
well
defined
in
any
case
do
not
keep
me
in
suspense
what
is
this
sin
it
is
easy
to
explain
nevertheless
i
will
try
lust
i
believe
can
be
classified
into
ordinary
sin
sin
against
nature
bestiality
and
let
us
add
and
sacrilege
well
there
is
in
addition
to
these
what
i
shall
call
pygmalionism
which
embraces
at
the
same
time
cerebral
onanism
and
incest
imagine
an
artist
falling
in
love
with
his
child
his
creation
with
an
hérodiade
a
judith
a
helen
a
jeanne
whom
he
has
either
described
or
painted
and
evoking
her
and
finally
possessing
her
in
dream
well
this
love
is
worse
than
normal
incest
in
the
latter
sin
the
guilty
one
commits
only
a
because
his
daughter
is
not
born
solely
of
his
substance
but
also
of
the
flesh
of
another
thus
logically
in
incest
there
is
a
side
almost
licit
because
part
of
another
person
has
entered
into
the
engendering
of
the
while
in
pygmalionism
the
father
violates
the
child
of
his
soul
of
that
which
alone
is
purely
and
really
his
which
alone
he
can
impregnate
without
the
aid
of
another
the
offence
is
then
entire
and
complete
now
is
there
not
also
disdain
of
nature
of
the
work
of
god
since
the
subject
of
the
sin
is
no
longer
as
even
in
bestiality
a
palpable
and
living
creature
but
an
unreal
being
created
by
a
projection
of
the
desecrated
talent
a
being
almost
celestial
since
by
genius
by
artistry
it
often
becomes
immortal
let
us
go
further
if
you
wish
suppose
that
an
artist
depicts
a
saint
and
becomes
enamoured
of
her
thus
we
have
complications
of
crime
against
nature
and
of
sacrilege
an
enormity
which
perhaps
is
exquisite
he
was
taken
aback
by
the
word
she
had
used
she
rose
opened
the
door
and
called
her
husband
dear
she
said
durtal
has
discovered
a
new
sin
surely
not
said
chantelouve
his
figure
framed
in
the
doorway
the
book
of
sins
is
an
edition
new
sins
can
not
be
invented
but
old
ones
may
be
kept
from
falling
into
oblivion
well
what
is
this
sin
of
his
durtal
explained
the
theory
but
it
is
simply
a
refined
expression
of
succubacy
the
consort
is
not
one
work
become
animate
but
a
succubus
which
by
night
takes
that
form
admit
at
any
rate
that
this
cerebral
hermaphrodism
is
a
distinguished
vice
at
least
being
the
privilege
of
the
artist
a
vice
reserved
for
the
elect
inaccessible
to
the
mob
if
you
like
exclusive
obscenity
laughed
chantelouve
but
i
must
get
back
to
the
lives
of
the
saints
the
atmosphere
is
fresher
and
more
benign
so
excuse
me
durtal
i
leave
it
to
my
wife
to
continue
this
marivaux
conversation
about
satanism
with
you
he
said
it
in
the
simplest
most
debonair
fashion
to
be
imagined
but
with
just
the
slightest
trace
of
irony
which
durtal
perceived
it
must
be
quite
late
he
thought
when
the
door
closed
after
chantelouve
he
consulted
his
watch
nearly
eleven
he
rose
to
take
leave
when
shall
i
see
you
he
murmured
very
low
your
apartment
tomorrow
night
at
nine
he
looked
at
her
with
beseeching
eyes
she
understood
but
wished
to
tease
him
she
kissed
him
maternally
on
the
forehead
then
consulted
his
eyes
again
the
expression
of
supplication
must
have
remained
unchanged
for
she
responded
to
their
imploration
by
a
long
kiss
which
closed
them
then
came
down
to
his
lips
drinking
their
dolorous
emotion
then
she
rang
and
told
her
maid
to
light
durtal
through
the
hall
he
descended
satisfied
that
she
had
engaged
herself
to
yield
tomorrow
night
chapter
xiii
he
began
again
as
on
the
other
evening
to
clean
house
and
establish
a
methodical
disorder
he
slipped
a
cushion
under
the
false
disarray
of
the
armchair
then
he
made
roaring
fires
to
have
the
rooms
good
and
warm
when
she
came
but
he
was
without
impatience
that
silent
promise
which
he
had
obtained
that
mme
chantelouve
would
not
leave
him
panting
this
night
moderated
him
now
that
his
uncertainty
was
at
an
end
he
no
longer
vibrated
with
the
almost
painful
acuity
which
hitherto
her
malignant
delays
had
provoked
he
soothed
himself
by
poking
the
fire
his
mind
was
still
full
of
her
but
plethoric
content
when
his
thoughts
stirred
at
all
it
was
at
the
very
most
to
revolve
the
question
how
shall
i
go
about
it
when
the
time
comes
so
as
not
to
be
ridiculous
this
question
which
had
so
harassed
him
the
other
night
left
him
troubled
but
inert
he
did
not
try
to
solve
it
but
decided
to
leave
everything
to
chance
since
the
best
planned
strategy
was
almost
always
abortive
then
he
revolted
against
himself
accused
himself
of
stagnation
and
walked
up
and
down
to
shake
himself
out
of
a
torpor
which
might
have
been
attributed
to
the
hot
fire
well
well
was
it
because
he
had
had
to
wait
so
long
that
his
desires
had
left
him
or
at
least
quit
bothering
him
no
they
had
not
why
he
was
yearning
now
for
the
moment
when
he
might
crush
that
woman
he
thought
he
had
the
explanation
of
his
lack
of
enthusiasm
in
the
stage
fright
inseparable
from
any
beginning
it
will
not
be
really
exquisite
tonight
until
after
the
newness
wears
off
and
the
grotesque
with
it
after
i
know
her
i
shall
be
able
to
consort
with
her
again
without
feeling
solicitous
about
her
and
conscious
of
myself
i
wish
we
were
on
that
happy
basis
now
the
cat
sitting
on
the
table
cocked
up
its
ears
gazed
at
the
door
with
its
black
eyes
and
fled
the
bell
rang
and
durtal
went
to
let
her
in
her
costume
pleased
him
he
took
off
her
furs
her
skirt
was
of
a
plum
colour
so
dark
that
it
was
almost
black
the
material
thick
and
supple
outlining
her
figure
squeezing
her
arms
making
an
hourglass
of
her
waist
accentuating
the
curve
of
her
hips
and
the
bulge
of
her
corset
you
are
charming
he
said
kissing
her
wrists
and
he
was
pleased
to
find
that
his
lips
had
accelerated
her
pulse
she
did
not
speak
could
hardly
breathe
she
was
agitated
and
very
pale
he
sat
down
facing
her
she
looked
at
him
with
her
mysterious
half
sleepy
eyes
he
felt
that
he
was
falling
in
love
all
over
again
he
forgot
his
reasonings
and
his
fears
and
took
acute
pleasure
in
penetrating
the
mystery
of
these
eyes
and
studying
the
vague
smile
of
this
dolorous
mouth
he
enlaced
her
fingers
in
his
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
low
voice
he
called
her
hyacinthe
she
listened
her
breast
heaving
her
hands
in
a
fever
then
in
a
supplicating
voice
i
implore
you
she
said
let
us
have
none
of
that
only
desire
is
good
oh
i
am
rational
i
mean
what
i
say
i
thought
it
all
out
on
the
way
here
i
left
him
very
sad
tonight
if
you
knew
how
i
feel
i
went
to
church
today
and
was
afraid
and
hid
myself
when
i
saw
my
confessor
these
plaints
he
had
heard
before
and
he
said
to
himself
you
may
sing
whatever
tune
you
want
to
but
you
shall
dance
tonight
aloud
he
answered
in
monosyllables
as
he
continued
to
take
possession
of
her
he
rose
thinking
she
would
do
the
same
or
that
if
she
remained
seated
he
could
better
reach
her
lips
by
bending
over
her
your
lips
your
lips
the
kiss
you
gave
me
last
night
he
murmured
as
his
face
came
close
to
hers
she
put
up
her
lips
and
stood
and
they
embraced
but
as
his
hands
went
seeking
she
recoiled
think
how
ridiculous
it
all
is
she
said
in
a
low
voice
to
undress
put
on
night
clothes
and
that
silly
scene
getting
into
bed
he
avoided
declaring
but
attempted
by
an
embrace
which
bent
her
over
backward
to
make
her
understand
that
she
could
spare
herself
those
embarrassments
tacitly
in
his
own
turn
feeling
her
body
stiffen
under
his
fingers
he
understood
that
she
absolutely
would
not
give
herself
in
the
room
here
in
front
of
the
fire
oh
well
she
said
disengaging
herself
if
you
will
have
it
he
made
way
to
allow
her
to
go
into
the
other
room
and
seeing
that
she
desired
to
be
alone
he
drew
the
portière
sitting
before
the
fire
he
reflected
perhaps
he
ought
to
have
pulled
down
the
bed
covers
and
not
left
her
the
task
but
without
doubt
the
action
would
have
been
too
direct
too
obvious
a
hint
ah
and
that
water
heater
he
took
it
and
keeping
away
from
the
bedroom
door
went
to
the
bathroom
placed
the
heater
on
the
toilet
table
and
then
swiftly
he
set
out
the
rice
powder
box
the
perfumes
the
combs
and
returning
into
his
study
he
listened
she
was
making
as
little
noise
as
possible
walking
on
tiptoe
as
if
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
she
blew
out
the
candles
doubtless
wishing
no
more
light
than
the
rosy
glow
of
the
hearth
he
felt
positively
annihilated
the
irritating
impression
of
the
lips
and
eyes
of
hyacinthe
was
far
from
him
now
she
was
nothing
but
a
woman
like
any
other
undressing
in
a
man
room
memories
of
similar
scenes
overwhelmed
him
he
remembered
girls
who
like
her
had
crept
about
on
the
carpet
so
as
not
to
be
heard
and
who
had
stopped
short
ashamed
for
a
whole
second
if
they
bumped
against
the
water
pitcher
and
then
what
good
was
this
going
to
do
him
now
that
she
was
yielding
he
no
longer
desired
her
disillusion
had
come
even
before
possession
not
waiting
as
usual
till
afterward
he
was
distressed
to
the
point
of
tears
the
frightened
cat
glided
under
the
curtain
ran
from
one
room
to
the
other
and
finally
came
back
to
his
master
and
jumped
onto
his
knees
caressing
him
durtal
said
to
himself
decidedly
she
was
right
when
she
refused
it
will
be
grotesque
atrocious
i
was
wrong
to
insist
but
no
it
her
fault
too
she
must
have
wanted
to
do
this
or
she
have
come
what
a
fool
to
think
she
could
aggravate
passion
by
delay
she
is
fearfully
clumsy
a
moment
ago
when
i
was
embracing
her
and
really
was
aroused
it
would
perhaps
have
been
delicious
but
now
and
what
do
i
look
like
a
young
bridegroom
waiting
or
a
green
country
boy
oh
god
how
stupid
well
he
said
straining
his
ears
and
hearing
no
sound
from
the
other
room
she
in
bed
i
must
go
in
i
suppose
it
took
her
all
this
time
to
unharness
herself
from
her
corset
she
was
a
fool
to
wear
one
he
concluded
when
drawing
the
curtain
he
stepped
into
the
other
room
mme
chantelouve
was
buried
under
the
thick
coverlet
her
mouth
and
her
eyes
closed
but
he
saw
that
she
was
peering
at
him
through
the
fringe
of
her
blonde
eyelashes
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
she
huddled
up
drawing
the
cover
over
her
chin
cold
dear
no
and
she
opened
wide
her
eyes
which
flashed
sparks
he
undressed
casting
a
rapid
glance
at
hyacinthe
face
it
was
hidden
in
the
darkness
but
was
sometimes
revealed
by
a
flare
of
the
red
hot
fire
as
a
stick
half
consumed
and
smouldering
would
suddenly
burst
into
flame
swiftly
he
slipped
between
the
covers
he
clasped
a
corpse
a
body
so
cold
that
it
froze
him
but
the
woman
lips
were
burning
as
she
silently
gnawed
his
features
he
lay
stupified
in
the
grip
of
this
body
wound
around
his
own
supple
as
the
and
hard
he
could
not
move
he
could
not
speak
for
the
shower
of
kisses
traveling
over
his
face
finally
he
succeeded
in
disengaging
himself
and
with
his
free
arm
he
sought
her
then
suddenly
while
she
devoured
his
lips
he
felt
a
nervous
inhibition
and
naturally
without
profit
he
withdrew
i
detest
you
she
exclaimed
why
i
detest
you
he
wanted
to
cry
out
and
i
you
he
was
exasperated
and
would
have
given
all
he
owned
to
get
her
to
dress
and
go
home
the
fire
was
burning
low
unflickering
appeased
now
he
sat
up
and
looked
into
the
darkness
he
would
have
liked
to
get
up
and
find
another
nightshirt
because
the
one
he
had
on
was
tearing
and
getting
in
his
way
but
hyacinthe
was
lying
on
top
of
it
then
he
reflected
that
the
bed
was
deranged
and
the
thought
affected
him
because
he
liked
to
be
snug
in
winter
and
knowing
himself
incapable
of
respreading
the
covers
he
foresaw
a
cold
night
once
more
he
was
enlaced
the
gripe
of
the
woman
on
his
own
was
renewed
rational
this
time
he
attended
to
her
and
crushed
her
with
mighty
caresses
in
a
changed
voice
lower
more
guttural
she
uttered
ignoble
things
and
silly
cries
which
gave
him
pain
my
dear
oh
hon
oh
i
ca
stand
it
aroused
nevertheless
he
took
this
body
which
creaked
as
it
writhed
and
he
experienced
the
extraordinary
sensation
of
a
spasmodic
burning
within
a
swaddle
of
he
finally
jumped
over
her
out
of
bed
and
lighted
the
candles
on
the
dresser
the
cat
sat
motionless
considering
durtal
and
mme
chantelouve
alternately
durtal
saw
an
inexpressible
mockery
in
those
black
eyes
and
irritated
chased
the
beast
away
he
put
some
more
wood
on
the
fire
dressed
and
started
to
leave
the
room
hyacinthe
called
him
gently
in
her
usual
voice
he
approached
the
bed
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
hung
there
kissing
him
hungrily
then
sinking
back
and
putting
her
arms
under
the
cover
she
said
the
deed
is
done
now
will
you
love
me
any
better
he
did
not
have
the
heart
to
answer
ah
yes
his
disillusion
was
complete
the
satiety
following
justified
his
lack
of
appetite
preceding
she
revolted
him
horrified
him
was
it
possible
to
have
so
desired
a
woman
only
to
come
to
that
he
had
idealized
her
in
his
transports
he
had
dreamed
in
her
eyes
he
knew
not
what
he
had
wished
to
exalt
himself
with
her
to
rise
higher
than
the
delirious
ravenings
of
the
senses
to
soar
out
of
the
world
into
joys
supernal
and
unexplored
and
his
dream
had
been
shattered
he
remained
fettered
to
earth
was
there
no
means
of
escaping
out
of
one
self
out
of
earthly
limitations
and
attaining
an
upper
ether
where
the
soul
ravished
would
glory
in
its
giddy
flight
ah
the
lesson
was
hard
and
decisive
for
having
one
time
hoped
so
much
what
regrets
what
a
tumble
decidedly
reality
does
not
pardon
him
who
despises
her
she
avenges
herself
by
shattering
the
dream
and
trampling
it
and
casting
the
fragments
into
a
cesspool
do
be
vexed
dear
because
it
is
taking
me
so
long
said
mme
chantelouve
behind
the
curtain
he
thought
crudely
i
wish
you
would
get
to
hell
out
of
here
and
aloud
he
asked
politely
if
she
had
need
of
his
services
she
was
so
mysterious
so
enticing
he
resumed
to
himself
her
eyes
remote
deep
as
space
and
reflecting
cemeteries
and
festivals
at
the
same
time
and
she
has
shown
herself
up
for
all
she
is
within
an
hour
i
have
seen
a
new
hyacinthe
talking
like
a
silly
little
milliner
in
heat
all
the
nastinesses
of
women
unite
in
her
to
exasperate
me
after
a
thoughtful
silence
he
concluded
i
must
be
young
indeed
to
have
lost
my
head
the
way
i
did
as
if
echoing
his
thought
mme
chantelouve
coming
out
through
the
portière
laughed
nervously
and
said
a
woman
of
my
age
doing
a
mad
thing
like
that
she
looked
at
him
and
though
he
forced
a
smile
she
understood
you
will
sleep
tonight
she
said
sadly
alluding
to
durtal
former
complaints
of
sleeplessness
on
her
account
he
begged
her
to
sit
down
and
warm
herself
but
she
said
she
was
not
cold
why
in
spite
of
the
warmth
of
the
room
you
were
cold
as
ice
oh
i
am
always
that
way
winter
and
summer
my
flesh
is
chilly
he
thought
that
in
august
this
frigid
body
might
be
agreeable
but
now
he
offered
her
some
bonbons
which
she
refused
then
she
said
she
would
take
a
sip
of
the
alkermes
which
he
poured
into
a
tiny
silver
goblet
she
took
just
a
drop
and
amicably
they
discussed
the
taste
of
this
preparation
in
which
she
recognized
an
aroma
of
clove
tempered
by
flower
of
cinnamon
moistened
with
distillate
of
rose
water
then
he
became
silent
my
poor
dear
she
said
how
i
should
love
him
if
he
were
more
confiding
and
not
always
on
his
guard
he
asked
her
to
explain
herself
why
i
mean
that
you
ca
forget
yourself
and
simply
let
yourself
be
loved
alas
you
were
reasoning
all
the
time
i
was
not
she
kissed
him
tenderly
you
see
i
love
you
anyway
and
he
was
surprised
to
see
how
sad
and
moved
she
looked
and
he
observed
a
sort
of
frightened
gratitude
in
her
eyes
she
is
easily
satisfied
he
said
to
himself
what
are
you
thinking
about
you
she
sighed
then
what
time
is
it
half
past
ten
i
must
go
he
is
waiting
for
me
no
do
say
anything
she
passed
her
hands
over
her
cheeks
he
seized
her
gently
by
the
waist
and
kissed
her
holding
her
thus
enlaced
until
they
were
at
the
door
you
will
come
again
soon
wo
you
yes
yes
he
returned
to
the
fireside
oof
it
done
he
thought
in
a
whirl
of
confused
emotions
his
vanity
was
satisfied
his
selfesteem
was
no
longer
bleeding
he
had
attained
his
ends
and
possessed
this
woman
moreover
her
spell
over
him
had
lost
its
force
he
was
regaining
his
entire
liberty
of
mind
but
who
could
tell
what
trouble
this
liaison
had
yet
in
store
for
him
then
in
spite
of
everything
he
softened
after
all
what
could
he
reproach
her
with
she
loved
as
well
as
she
could
she
was
indeed
ardent
and
plaintive
even
this
dualism
of
a
mistress
who
was
a
low
cocotte
in
bed
and
a
fine
lady
when
dressed
or
no
too
intelligent
to
be
called
a
fine
lady
was
a
delectable
pimento
her
carnal
appetites
were
excessive
and
bizarre
what
then
was
the
matter
with
him
and
at
last
he
quite
justly
accused
himself
it
was
his
own
fault
if
everything
was
spoiled
he
lacked
appetite
he
was
not
really
tormented
except
by
a
cerebral
erethism
he
was
used
up
in
body
filed
away
in
soul
inept
at
love
weary
of
tendernesses
even
before
he
received
them
and
disgusted
when
he
had
his
heart
was
dead
and
could
not
be
revived
and
his
mania
for
thinking
thinking
previsualizing
an
incident
so
vividly
that
actual
enactment
was
an
anticlimax
but
probably
would
not
be
if
his
mind
would
leave
him
alone
and
not
be
always
jeering
at
his
efforts
for
a
man
in
his
state
of
spiritual
impoverishment
all
save
art
was
but
a
recreation
more
or
less
boring
a
diversion
more
or
less
vain
ah
poor
woman
i
am
afraid
she
is
going
to
get
pretty
sick
of
me
if
only
she
would
consent
to
come
no
more
but
no
she
deserve
to
be
treated
in
that
fashion
and
seized
by
pity
he
swore
to
himself
that
the
next
time
she
visited
him
he
would
caress
her
and
try
to
persuade
her
that
the
disillusion
which
he
had
so
ill
concealed
did
not
exist
he
tried
to
spread
up
the
bed
get
the
tousled
blankets
together
and
plump
the
pillows
then
he
lay
down
he
put
out
his
lamp
in
the
darkness
his
distress
increased
with
death
in
his
heart
he
said
to
himself
yes
i
was
right
in
declaring
that
the
only
women
you
can
continue
to
love
are
those
you
lose
to
learn
three
years
later
when
the
woman
is
inaccessible
chaste
and
married
dead
perhaps
or
out
of
france
to
learn
that
she
loved
you
though
you
had
not
dared
believe
it
while
she
was
near
you
ah
the
dream
these
real
and
intangible
loves
these
loves
made
up
of
melancholy
and
distant
regrets
are
the
only
ones
that
count
because
there
is
no
flesh
in
them
no
earthly
leaven
to
love
at
a
distance
and
without
hope
never
to
possess
to
dream
chastely
of
pale
charms
and
impossible
kisses
extinguished
on
the
waxen
brow
of
death
ah
that
is
something
like
it
a
delicious
straying
away
from
the
world
and
never
the
return
as
only
the
unreal
is
not
ignoble
and
empty
existence
must
be
admitted
to
be
abominable
yes
imagination
is
the
only
good
thing
which
heaven
vouchsafes
to
the
skeptic
and
pessimist
alarmed
by
the
eternal
abjectness
of
life
chapter
xiv
from
this
scene
he
had
learned
an
alarming
lesson
that
the
flesh
domineers
the
soul
and
refuses
to
admit
any
schism
the
flesh
decisively
does
not
intend
that
one
shall
get
along
without
it
and
indulge
in
pleasures
which
it
can
partake
only
on
condition
that
it
keep
quiet
for
the
first
time
reviewing
these
turpitudes
he
really
understood
the
meaning
of
that
now
obsolete
word
and
he
savoured
it
in
all
its
pristine
freshness
just
as
a
man
who
has
drunk
too
deeply
the
night
before
thinks
the
morning
after
of
drinking
nothing
but
mineral
water
in
future
so
he
dreamed
today
of
pure
affection
far
from
a
bed
he
was
still
ruminating
these
thoughts
when
des
hermies
entered
they
spoke
of
amorous
misadventures
astonished
at
once
by
languor
and
the
ascetic
tone
of
his
remarks
des
hermies
exclaimed
ah
we
had
a
gay
old
time
last
night
with
the
most
decisive
bad
grace
durtal
shook
his
head
then
replied
des
hermies
you
are
superior
and
inhuman
to
love
without
hope
immaculately
would
be
perfect
if
it
did
not
induct
such
brainstorms
there
is
no
excuse
for
chastity
unless
one
has
a
pious
end
in
view
or
unless
the
senses
are
failing
and
if
they
are
one
had
best
see
a
doctor
who
will
solve
the
question
more
or
less
unsatisfactorily
to
tell
the
truth
everything
on
earth
culminates
in
the
act
you
reprove
the
heart
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
noble
part
of
man
has
the
same
form
as
the
penis
which
is
the
ignoble
part
of
man
there
symbolism
in
that
similarity
because
every
love
which
is
of
the
heart
soon
extends
to
the
organ
resembling
it
the
human
imagination
the
moment
it
tries
to
create
artificially
animated
beings
involuntarily
reproduces
in
them
the
movements
of
animals
propagating
look
at
the
machines
the
action
of
the
piston
and
the
cylinder
romeos
of
steel
and
juliets
of
cast
iron
nor
do
the
loftier
expressions
of
the
human
intellect
get
away
from
the
advance
and
withdrawal
copied
by
the
machines
one
must
bow
to
nature
law
if
one
is
neither
impotent
nor
a
saint
now
you
are
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
i
think
but
if
from
inconceivable
motives
you
desire
to
live
in
temporary
continence
follow
the
prescription
of
an
occultist
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
neapolitan
piperno
he
affirms
that
whoever
eats
vervain
can
not
approach
a
woman
for
seven
days
buy
a
jar
and
let
try
it
durtal
laughed
there
is
perhaps
a
middle
course
never
consummate
the
carnal
act
with
her
you
love
and
to
keep
yourself
quiet
frequent
those
you
do
not
love
thus
in
a
certain
measure
you
would
conjure
away
possible
disgust
no
one
would
never
get
it
out
of
one
head
that
with
the
woman
of
whom
one
was
enamoured
one
would
experience
carnal
delights
absolutely
different
from
those
which
one
feels
with
the
others
so
your
method
also
would
end
badly
and
too
the
women
who
would
not
be
indifferent
to
one
have
not
charity
and
discretion
enough
to
admire
the
wisdom
of
this
selfishness
for
of
course
that
what
it
is
but
what
say
now
to
putting
on
your
shoes
it
almost
six
and
mama
carhaix
beef
ca
wait
it
had
already
been
taken
out
of
the
pot
and
couched
on
a
platter
amid
vegetables
when
they
arrived
carhaix
sprawling
in
an
armchair
was
reading
his
breviary
what
going
on
in
the
world
he
asked
closing
his
book
nothing
politics
does
interest
us
and
general
american
tricks
of
publicity
weary
you
as
much
as
they
do
us
i
suppose
the
other
newspaper
stories
are
just
a
little
more
shocking
or
dull
than
look
out
you
burn
your
mouth
as
durtal
was
preparing
to
take
a
spoonful
of
soup
in
fact
said
durtal
grimacing
this
marrowy
soup
so
artistically
golden
is
like
liquid
fire
but
speaking
of
the
news
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
there
is
nothing
of
pressing
importance
and
the
trial
of
that
astonishing
abbé
boudes
going
on
before
the
assizes
of
aveyron
after
trying
to
poison
his
curate
through
the
sacramental
wine
and
committing
such
other
crimes
as
abortion
rape
flagrant
misconduct
forgery
qualified
theft
and
usury
he
ended
by
appropriating
the
money
put
in
the
coin
boxes
for
the
souls
in
purgatory
and
pawning
the
ciborium
chalice
all
the
holy
vessels
that
case
is
worth
following
carhaix
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
if
he
is
not
sent
to
jail
there
will
be
one
more
priest
for
paris
said
des
hermies
how
that
why
all
the
ecclesiastics
who
get
in
bad
in
the
provinces
or
who
have
a
serious
falling
out
with
the
bishop
are
sent
here
where
they
will
be
less
in
view
lost
in
the
crowd
as
it
were
they
form
a
part
of
that
corporation
known
as
priests
what
are
they
priests
loosely
attached
to
a
parish
you
know
that
in
addition
to
a
curate
ministrants
vicars
and
regular
clergy
there
are
in
every
church
adjunct
priests
supply
priests
those
are
the
ones
i
am
talking
about
they
do
the
heavy
work
celebrate
the
morning
masses
when
everybody
is
asleep
and
the
late
masses
when
everybody
is
doing
it
is
they
who
get
up
at
night
to
take
the
sacrament
to
the
poor
and
who
sit
up
with
the
corpses
of
the
devout
rich
and
catch
cold
standing
under
the
dripping
church
porches
at
funerals
and
get
sunstroke
or
pneumonia
in
the
cemetery
they
do
all
the
dirty
work
for
a
five
or
ten
franc
fee
they
act
as
substitutes
for
colleagues
who
have
good
livings
and
are
tired
of
service
they
are
men
under
a
cloud
for
the
most
part
churches
take
them
on
ready
to
fire
them
at
a
moment
notice
and
keep
strict
watch
over
them
while
waiting
for
them
to
be
interdicted
or
to
have
their
taken
away
i
simply
mean
that
the
provincial
parishes
excavate
on
the
city
the
priests
who
for
one
reason
or
another
have
ceased
to
please
but
what
do
the
curates
and
other
titulary
abbés
if
they
unload
their
duties
onto
the
backs
of
others
they
do
the
elegant
easy
work
which
requires
no
effort
no
charity
they
shrive
society
women
who
come
to
confession
in
their
most
stunning
gowns
they
teach
proper
little
prigs
the
catechism
and
preach
and
play
the
limelight
rôles
in
the
gala
ceremonials
which
are
got
up
to
pander
to
the
tastes
of
the
faithful
at
paris
not
counting
the
scratch
priests
the
clergy
is
divided
thus
priests
in
easy
circumstances
these
are
placed
at
la
madeleine
and
saint
roch
where
the
congregations
are
wealthy
they
are
wined
and
dined
they
pass
their
lives
in
and
comfort
only
elegant
souls
other
priests
who
are
good
desk
clerks
for
the
most
part
but
who
have
neither
the
education
nor
the
fortune
necessary
to
participate
in
the
inconsequentialities
of
the
idle
rich
they
live
more
in
seclusion
and
visit
only
among
the
middle
class
they
console
themselves
for
their
unfashionableness
by
playing
cards
with
each
other
and
uttering
crude
commonplaces
at
the
table
now
des
hermies
said
carhaix
you
are
going
too
far
i
claim
to
know
the
clerical
world
myself
and
there
are
even
in
paris
honest
men
who
do
their
duty
they
are
covered
with
opprobrium
and
spat
on
every
tom
dick
and
harry
accuses
them
of
the
foulest
vices
but
after
all
it
must
be
said
that
the
abbé
boudes
and
the
canon
docres
are
exceptions
thank
god
and
outside
of
paris
there
are
veritable
saints
especially
among
the
country
clergy
it
a
fact
that
satanic
priests
are
relatively
rare
and
the
lecheries
of
the
clergy
and
the
knaveries
of
the
episcopate
are
evidently
exaggerated
by
an
ignoble
press
but
that
is
what
i
have
against
them
if
only
they
were
gamblers
and
libertines
but
lukewarm
mediocre
lazy
imbeciles
that
is
their
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
the
only
sin
which
the
all
merciful
does
not
pardon
they
are
of
their
time
said
durtal
you
would
expect
to
find
the
soul
of
the
middle
ages
inculcated
by
the
seminaries
then
carhaix
observed
our
friend
forgets
that
there
are
impeccable
monastic
orders
the
carthusians
for
instance
yes
and
the
trappists
and
the
franciscans
but
they
are
cloistered
orders
which
live
in
shelter
from
an
infamous
century
take
on
the
other
hand
the
order
of
saint
dominic
which
exists
for
the
fashionable
world
that
is
the
order
which
produces
jewelled
dudes
like
monsabre
and
didon
enough
said
they
are
the
hussars
of
religion
the
jaunty
lancers
the
spick
and
span
and
zouaves
while
the
good
capuchins
are
the
humble
poilus
of
the
soul
said
durtal
if
only
they
loved
bells
sighed
carhaix
shaking
his
head
well
pass
the
coulommiers
he
said
to
his
wife
who
was
taking
up
the
salad
bowl
and
the
plates
in
silence
they
ate
this
cheese
des
hermies
filled
the
glasses
tell
me
durtal
asked
des
hermies
do
you
know
whether
a
woman
who
receives
visits
from
the
incubi
necessarily
has
a
cold
body
in
other
words
is
a
cold
body
a
presumable
symptom
of
incubacy
as
of
old
the
inability
to
shed
tears
served
the
inquisition
as
proof
positive
to
convict
witches
yes
i
can
answer
you
formerly
women
smitten
with
incubacy
had
frigid
flesh
even
in
the
month
of
august
the
books
of
the
specialists
bear
witness
but
now
the
majority
of
the
creatures
who
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
summon
or
receive
the
amorous
larvæ
have
on
the
contrary
a
skin
that
is
burning
and
dry
to
the
touch
this
transformation
is
not
yet
general
but
tends
to
become
so
i
remember
very
well
that
johannès
he
of
whom
gévingey
told
you
was
often
obliged
at
the
moment
when
he
attempted
to
deliver
the
patient
to
bring
the
body
back
to
normal
temperature
with
lotions
of
dilute
hydriodate
of
potassium
ah
said
durtal
who
was
thinking
of
mme
chantelouve
you
do
know
what
has
become
of
dr
johannès
asked
carhaix
he
is
living
very
much
in
retirement
at
lyons
he
continues
i
believe
to
cure
venefices
and
he
preaches
the
blessed
coming
of
the
paraclete
for
heaven
sake
who
is
this
doctor
asked
durtal
he
is
a
very
intelligent
and
learned
priest
he
was
superior
of
a
community
and
he
directed
here
in
paris
the
only
review
which
ever
was
really
mystical
he
was
a
theologian
much
consulted
a
recognized
master
of
divine
jurisprudence
then
he
had
distressing
quarrels
with
the
papal
curia
at
rome
and
with
the
of
paris
his
exorcisms
and
his
battles
against
the
incubi
especially
in
the
female
convents
ruined
him
ah
i
remember
the
last
time
i
saw
him
as
if
it
were
yesterday
i
met
him
in
the
rue
grenelle
coming
out
of
the
archbishop
house
the
day
he
quitted
the
church
after
a
scene
which
he
told
me
all
about
again
i
can
see
that
priest
walking
with
me
along
the
deserted
boulevard
des
invalides
he
was
pale
and
his
defeated
but
impressive
voice
trembled
he
had
been
summoned
and
commanded
to
explain
his
actions
in
the
case
of
an
epileptic
woman
whom
he
claimed
to
have
cured
with
the
aid
of
a
relic
the
seamless
robe
of
christ
preserved
at
argenteuil
the
cardinal
assisted
by
two
grand
vicars
listened
to
him
standing
when
he
had
likewise
furnished
the
information
which
they
demanded
about
his
cures
of
witch
spells
cardinal
guibert
said
had
best
go
to
la
trappe
and
i
remember
word
for
word
his
reply
i
have
violated
the
laws
of
the
church
i
am
ready
to
undergo
the
penalty
of
my
fault
if
you
think
me
culpable
pass
a
canonical
judgment
and
i
will
execute
it
i
swear
on
my
sacerdotal
honour
but
i
wish
a
formal
sentence
for
in
law
nobody
is
bound
to
condemn
himself
se
tradere
says
the
corpus
juris
canonici
there
was
a
copy
of
his
review
on
the
table
the
cardinal
pointed
to
a
page
and
asked
you
write
that
eminence
doctrines
and
he
went
from
his
office
into
the
next
room
crying
of
my
sight
then
johannès
advanced
as
far
as
the
threshold
of
the
other
room
and
falling
on
his
knees
he
said
i
had
no
intention
of
offending
if
i
have
done
so
i
beg
forgiveness
the
cardinal
cried
more
loudly
of
my
sight
before
i
call
for
assistance
johannès
rose
and
left
my
old
ties
are
broken
he
said
as
he
parted
from
me
he
was
so
sad
that
i
had
not
the
heart
to
question
him
further
there
was
a
silence
carhaix
went
up
to
his
tower
to
ring
a
peal
his
wife
removed
the
dessert
dishes
and
the
cloth
des
hermies
prepared
the
coffee
durtal
pensive
rolled
his
cigarette
carhaix
when
he
returned
as
if
enveloped
in
a
fog
of
sounds
exclaimed
a
while
ago
des
hermies
you
were
speaking
of
the
franciscans
do
you
know
that
that
order
to
live
up
to
its
professions
of
poverty
was
supposed
not
to
possess
even
a
bell
true
this
rule
has
been
relaxed
somewhat
it
was
too
severe
now
they
have
a
bell
but
only
one
just
like
most
other
abbeys
then
no
because
all
communities
have
at
least
three
in
honour
of
the
holy
and
triple
hypostasis
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
number
of
bells
a
monastery
or
church
can
have
is
limited
by
rule
formerly
it
was
there
was
a
pious
hierarchy
of
ringing
the
bells
of
a
convent
could
not
sound
when
the
bells
of
a
church
pealed
they
were
the
vassals
and
respectful
and
submissive
as
became
their
rank
they
were
silent
when
the
suzerain
spoke
to
the
multitudes
these
principles
of
procedure
consecrated
in
by
a
canon
of
the
council
of
toulouse
and
confirmed
by
two
decrees
of
the
congress
of
rites
are
no
longer
followed
the
rulings
of
san
carlo
borromeo
who
decreed
that
a
church
should
have
from
five
to
seven
bells
a
boy
academy
three
and
a
parochial
school
two
are
abolished
today
churches
have
more
or
fewer
bells
as
they
are
more
or
less
rich
oh
well
why
worry
where
are
the
little
glasses
his
wife
brought
them
shook
hands
with
the
guests
and
retired
then
while
carhaix
was
pouring
the
cognac
des
hermies
said
in
a
low
voice
i
did
not
want
to
speak
before
her
because
these
matters
distress
and
frighten
her
but
i
received
a
singular
visit
this
morning
from
gévingey
who
is
running
over
to
lyons
to
see
johannès
he
claims
to
have
been
bewitched
by
canon
docre
who
it
seems
is
making
a
flying
visit
to
paris
what
have
been
their
relations
i
do
know
anyway
gévingey
is
in
a
deplorable
state
just
what
seems
to
be
the
matter
with
him
asked
durtal
i
positively
do
not
know
i
made
a
careful
auscultation
and
examined
him
thoroughly
he
complains
of
needles
pricking
him
around
the
heart
i
observed
nervous
trouble
and
nothing
else
what
i
am
most
worried
about
is
a
state
of
enfeeblement
inexplicable
in
a
man
who
is
neither
cancerous
nor
diabetical
ah
said
carhaix
i
suppose
people
are
not
betwitched
now
with
wax
images
and
needles
with
the
or
the
as
it
was
called
in
the
good
old
days
no
those
practises
are
now
out
of
date
and
almost
everywhere
fallen
into
disuse
gévingey
who
took
me
completely
into
his
confidence
this
morning
told
me
what
extraordinary
recipes
the
frightful
canon
uses
these
are
it
seems
the
unrevealed
secrets
of
modern
magic
ah
that
what
interests
me
exclaimed
durtal
of
course
i
limit
myself
to
repeating
what
was
told
me
resumed
des
hermies
lighting
his
cigarette
well
docre
keeps
white
mice
in
cages
and
he
takes
them
along
when
he
travels
he
feeds
them
on
consecrated
hosts
and
on
pastes
impregnated
with
poisons
skilfully
dosed
when
these
unhappy
beasts
are
saturated
he
takes
them
holds
them
over
a
chalice
and
with
a
very
sharp
instrument
he
pricks
them
here
and
there
the
blood
flows
into
the
vase
and
he
uses
it
in
a
way
which
i
shall
explain
in
a
moment
to
strike
his
enemies
with
death
formerly
he
operated
on
chickens
and
guinea
pigs
but
he
used
the
grease
not
the
blood
of
these
animals
become
thus
execrated
and
venomous
tabernacles
formerly
he
also
used
a
recipe
discovered
by
the
satanic
society
of
the
of
which
i
have
spoken
before
and
he
prepared
a
hash
composed
of
flour
meat
eucharist
bread
mercury
animal
semen
human
blood
acetate
of
morphine
and
aspic
oil
latterly
and
according
to
gévingey
this
abomination
is
more
perilous
yet
he
stuffs
fishes
with
communion
bread
and
with
toxins
skilfully
graduated
these
toxins
are
chosen
from
those
which
produce
madness
or
lockjaw
when
absorbed
through
the
pores
then
when
these
fishes
are
thoroughly
permeated
with
the
substances
sealed
by
sacrilege
docre
takes
them
out
of
the
water
lets
them
rot
distills
them
and
expresses
from
them
an
essential
oil
one
drop
of
which
will
produce
madness
this
drop
it
appears
is
applied
externally
by
touching
the
hair
as
in
balzac
hmmm
said
durtal
i
am
afraid
that
a
drop
of
this
oil
long
ago
fell
on
the
scalp
of
poor
old
gévingey
what
is
interesting
about
this
story
is
not
the
outlandishness
of
these
diabolical
pharmacopoeia
so
much
as
the
psychology
of
the
persons
who
invent
and
manipulate
them
think
this
is
happening
at
the
present
day
and
it
is
the
priests
who
have
invented
philtres
unknown
to
the
sorcerers
of
the
middle
ages
the
priests
no
a
priest
and
what
a
priest
remarked
carhaix
gévingey
is
very
precise
he
affirms
that
others
use
them
bewitchment
by
veniniferous
blood
of
mice
took
place
in
at
in
a
demoniac
circle
to
which
the
canon
belonged
it
is
true
in
in
savoy
the
oil
of
which
i
have
spoken
was
prepared
in
a
group
of
defrocked
abbés
as
you
see
docre
is
not
the
only
one
who
practises
this
abominable
science
it
is
known
in
the
convents
some
laymen
even
have
an
inkling
of
it
but
now
admitting
that
these
preparations
are
real
and
that
they
are
active
you
have
not
explained
how
one
can
poison
a
man
with
them
either
from
a
distance
or
near
at
hand
yes
that
another
matter
one
has
a
choice
of
two
methods
to
reach
the
enemy
one
is
aiming
at
the
first
and
least
used
is
this
the
magician
employs
a
voyant
a
woman
who
is
known
in
that
world
as
flying
spirit
she
is
a
somnambulist
who
put
into
a
hypnotic
state
can
betake
herself
in
spirit
wherever
one
wishes
her
to
go
it
is
then
possible
to
have
her
transmit
the
magic
poisons
to
a
person
whom
one
designates
hundreds
of
leagues
away
those
who
are
stricken
in
this
manner
have
seen
no
one
and
they
go
mad
or
die
without
suspecting
the
venefice
but
these
voyants
are
not
only
rare
they
are
also
unreliable
because
other
persons
can
likewise
fix
them
in
a
cataleptic
state
and
extract
confessions
from
them
so
you
see
why
persons
like
docre
have
recourse
to
the
second
method
which
is
surer
it
consists
in
evoking
just
as
in
spiritism
the
soul
of
a
dead
person
and
sending
it
to
strike
the
victim
with
the
prepared
spell
the
result
is
the
same
but
the
vehicle
is
different
there
concluded
des
hermies
reported
with
painstaking
exactness
are
the
confidences
which
our
friend
gévingey
made
me
this
morning
and
johannès
cures
people
poisoned
in
this
manner
asked
carhaix
yes
johannès
to
my
knowledge
has
made
inexplicable
cures
but
with
what
gévingey
tells
me
in
this
connection
that
the
doctor
celebrates
a
sacrifice
to
the
glory
of
melchisedek
i
have
the
faintest
idea
what
this
sacrifice
is
but
gévingey
will
perhaps
enlighten
us
if
he
returns
cured
in
spite
of
all
i
should
not
be
displeased
once
in
my
life
to
get
a
good
look
at
canon
docre
said
durtal
not
i
he
is
the
incarnation
of
the
accursed
on
earth
cried
carhaix
assisting
his
friends
to
put
on
their
overcoats
he
lighted
his
lantern
and
while
they
were
descending
the
stair
as
durtal
complained
of
the
cold
des
hermies
burst
into
a
laugh
if
your
family
had
known
the
magical
secrets
of
the
plants
you
would
not
shiver
this
way
he
said
it
was
learned
in
the
sixteenth
century
that
a
child
might
be
immune
to
heat
or
cold
all
his
life
if
his
hands
were
rubbed
with
juice
of
absinth
before
the
twelfth
month
of
his
life
had
passed
that
you
see
is
a
tempting
prescription
less
dangerous
than
those
which
canon
docre
abuses
once
below
after
carhaix
had
closed
the
door
of
his
tower
they
hastened
their
steps
for
the
north
wind
swept
the
square
after
all
said
des
hermies
satanism
aside
and
yet
satanism
also
is
a
phase
of
religion
admit
that
for
two
miscreants
of
our
sort
we
hold
singularly
pious
conversations
i
hope
they
will
be
counted
in
our
favour
up
above
no
merit
on
our
part
replied
durtal
for
what
else
is
there
to
talk
about
conversations
which
do
not
treat
of
religion
or
art
are
so
base
and
vain
chapter
xv
the
memory
of
these
frightful
magisteria
kept
racing
through
his
head
next
day
and
while
smoking
cigarettes
beside
the
fire
durtal
thought
of
docre
and
johannès
fighting
across
gévingey
back
smiting
and
parrying
with
incantations
and
exorcisms
in
the
christian
symbolism
he
said
to
himself
the
fish
is
one
of
the
representations
of
christ
doubtless
the
canon
thinks
to
aggravate
his
sacrileges
by
feeding
fishes
on
genuine
hosts
his
is
the
reverse
of
the
system
of
the
mediæval
witches
who
chose
a
vile
beast
dedicated
to
the
devil
to
submit
the
body
of
the
saviour
to
the
processes
of
digestion
how
real
is
the
pretended
power
which
the
deicide
chemists
are
alleged
to
wield
what
faith
can
we
put
in
the
tales
of
evoked
larvæ
killing
a
designated
person
to
order
with
corrosive
oil
and
blood
virus
none
unless
one
is
extremely
credulous
and
even
a
bit
mad
and
yet
come
to
think
of
it
we
find
today
unexplained
and
surviving
under
other
names
the
mysteries
which
were
so
long
reckoned
the
product
of
mediæval
imagination
and
superstition
at
the
charity
hospital
louis
transfers
maladies
from
one
hypnotized
person
to
another
wherein
is
that
less
miraculous
than
evocation
of
demons
than
spells
cast
by
magicians
or
pastors
a
larva
a
flying
spirit
is
not
indeed
more
extraordinary
than
a
microbe
coming
from
afar
and
poisoning
one
without
one
knowledge
and
the
atmosphere
can
certainly
convey
spirits
as
well
as
bacilli
certainly
the
ether
carries
untransformed
emanations
effluences
electricity
for
instance
or
the
fluids
of
a
magnet
which
sends
to
a
distant
subject
an
order
to
traverse
all
paris
to
rejoin
it
science
has
no
call
to
contest
these
phenomena
on
the
other
hand
rejuvenates
infirm
old
men
and
revitalizes
the
impotent
with
distillations
from
the
parts
of
rabbits
and
cavies
were
not
the
elixirs
of
life
and
the
love

the
witches

to
the
senile
and
impotent

of
similar
or
analogous
substances
human
semen

almost
always
in
the
middle
ages
into
the
compounding
of
these
mixtures
now
has
after
repeated
experiments
recently
demonstrated
the
virtues
of
semen
taken
from
one
man
and
instilled
into
another
finally
the
apparitions
doppelgänger
bilocations
to
speak
thus
of
the
spirits
that
terrified
antiquity
have
not
ceased
to
manifest
themselves
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
that
the
experiments
carried
on
for
three
years
by
crookes
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
were
cheats
if
he
has
been
able
to
photograph
visible
and
tangible
spectres
we
must
recognize
the
veracity
of
the
mediæval
thaumaturges
incredible
of
course
and
was
hypnotism
possession
of
one
soul
by
another
which
could
dedicate
it
to
crime
incredible
only
ten
years
ago
we
are
groping
in
shadow
that
is
sure
but
des
hermies
hit
the
when
he
remarked
is
less
important
to
know
whether
the
modern
pharmaceutic
sacrileges
are
potent
than
to
study
the
motives
of
the
satanists
and
fallen
priests
who
prepare
them
ah
if
there
were
some
way
of
getting
acquainted
with
canon
docre
of
insinuating
oneself
into
his
confidence
perhaps
one
would
attain
clear
insight
into
these
questions
i
learned
long
ago
that
there
are
no
people
interesting
to
know
except
saints
scoundrels
and
cranks
they
are
the
only
persons
whose
conversation
amounts
to
anything
persons
of
good
sense
are
necessarily
dull
because
they
revolve
over
and
over
again
the
tedious
topics
of
everyday
life
they
are
the
crowd
more
or
less
intelligent
but
they
are
the
crowd
and
they
give
me
a
pain
yes
but
who
will
put
me
in
touch
with
this
monstrous
priest
and
as
he
poked
the
fire
durtal
said
to
himself
chantelouve
if
he
would
but
he
wo
there
remains
his
wife
who
used
to
be
well
acquainted
with
docre
i
must
interrogate
her
and
find
out
whether
she
still
corresponds
with
him
and
sees
him
the
entrance
of
mme
chantelouve
into
his
reflections
saddened
him
he
took
out
his
watch
and
murmured
what
a
bore
she
will
come
again
and
again
i
shall
have
to
if
only
there
were
any
possibility
of
convincing
her
of
the
futility
of
the
carnal
somersaults
in
any
case
she
ca
be
very
well
pleased
because
to
her
frantic
letter
soliciting
a
meeting
i
responded
three
days
later
by
a
brief
dry
note
inviting
her
to
come
here
this
evening
it
certainly
was
lacking
in
lyricism
too
much
so
perhaps
he
rose
and
went
into
his
bedroom
to
make
sure
that
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
then
he
returned
and
sat
down
without
even
arranging
his
room
as
he
had
the
other
times
now
that
he
no
longer
cared
for
this
woman
gallantry
and
had
fled
he
awaited
her
without
impatience
his
slippers
on
his
feet
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
had
nothing
pleasant
from
hyacinthe
except
that
kiss
we
exchanged
when
her
husband
was
only
a
few
feet
away
i
certainly
shall
not
again
find
her
lips
and
fragrant
here
her
kiss
is
insipid
mme
chantelouve
rang
earlier
than
usual
well
she
said
sitting
down
you
wrote
me
a
nice
letter
how
that
confess
frankly
that
you
are
through
with
me
he
denied
this
but
she
shook
her
head
well
he
said
what
have
you
to
reproach
me
with
having
written
you
only
a
short
note
but
there
was
someone
here
i
was
busy
and
i
have
time
to
assemble
pretty
speeches
not
having
set
a
date
sooner
i
told
you
our
relation
necessitates
precautions
and
we
ca
see
each
other
very
often
i
think
i
gave
you
clearly
to
understand
my
motives
i
am
so
stupid
that
i
probably
did
not
understand
them
you
spoke
to
me
of
reasons
i
believe
yes
rather
vague
well
i
could
go
into
detail
and
tell
you
that
he
stopped
asking
himself
whether
the
time
had
come
to
break
decisively
with
her
but
he
remembered
that
he
wanted
her
aid
in
getting
information
about
docre
that
what
tell
me
he
shook
his
head
hesitating
not
to
tell
her
a
lie
but
to
insult
and
humiliate
her
well
he
went
on
since
you
force
me
to
do
it
i
will
confess
at
whatever
cost
that
i
have
had
a
mistress
for
several
years
i
add
that
our
relations
are
now
purely
amical
very
well
she
interrupted
your
family
reasons
are
sufficient
and
then
he
pursued
in
a
lower
tone
if
you
wish
to
know
all
well
i
have
a
child
by
her
a
child
oh
you
poor
dear
she
rose
then
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
withdraw
but
he
seized
her
hands
and
at
the
same
time
satisfied
with
the
success
of
his
deception
and
ashamed
of
his
brutality
he
begged
her
to
stay
awhile
she
refused
then
he
drew
her
to
him
kissed
her
hair
and
cajoled
her
her
troubled
eyes
looked
deep
into
his
ah
then
she
said
no
let
me
undress
not
for
the
world
yes
oh
the
scene
of
the
other
night
beginning
all
over
again
he
murmured
sinking
overwhelmed
into
a
chair
he
felt
borne
down
burdened
by
an
unspeakable
weariness
he
undressed
beside
the
fire
and
warmed
himself
while
waiting
for
her
to
get
to
bed
when
they
were
in
bed
she
enveloped
him
with
her
supple
cold
limbs
now
is
it
true
that
i
am
to
come
here
no
more
he
did
not
answer
but
understood
that
she
had
no
intention
of
going
away
and
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
person
of
the
staying
kind
tell
me
he
buried
his
head
in
her
breast
to
keep
from
having
to
answer
tell
me
in
my
lips
he
beset
her
furiously
to
make
her
keep
silent
then
he
lay
disabused
weary
happy
that
it
was
over
when
they
lay
down
again
she
put
her
arm
about
his
neck
and
ran
her
tongue
around
in
his
mouth
like
an
auger
but
he
paid
little
heed
to
caresses
and
remained
feeble
and
pathetic
then
she
bent
over
reached
him
and
he
groaned
ah
she
exclaimed
suddenly
rising
at
last
i
have
heard
you
cry
he
lay
broken
in
body
and
spirit
incapable
of
thinking
two
thoughts
in
sequence
his
brain
seemed
to
whir
undone
in
his
skull
he
collected
himself
however
rose
and
went
into
the
other
room
to
dress
and
let
her
do
the
same
through
the
drawn
portière
separating
the
two
rooms
he
saw
a
little
pinhole
of
light
which
came
from
the
wax
candle
placed
on
the
mantel
opposite
the
curtain
hyacinthe
going
back
and
forth
would
momentarily
intercept
this
light
then
it
would
flash
out
again
ah
she
said
my
poor
darling
you
have
a
child
the
shot
struck
home
said
he
to
himself
and
aloud
yes
a
little
girl
how
old
she
will
soon
be
six
and
he
described
her
as
lively
but
in
very
frail
health
requiring
multiple
precautions
and
constant
care
you
must
have
very
sad
evenings
said
mme
chantelouve
in
a
voice
of
emotion
from
behind
the
curtain
oh
yes
if
i
were
to
die
tomorrow
what
would
become
of
those
two
unfortunates
his
imagination
took
wing
he
began
himself
to
believe
the
mother
and
her
his
voice
trembled
tears
very
nearly
came
to
his
eyes
he
is
unhappy
my
darling
is
she
said
raising
the
curtain
and
returning
clothed
into
the
room
and
that
is
why
he
looks
so
sad
even
when
he
smiles
he
looked
at
her
surely
at
that
moment
her
affection
was
not
feigned
she
really
clung
to
him
why
oh
why
had
she
had
to
have
those
rages
of
lust
if
it
had
not
been
for
those
they
could
probably
have
been
good
comrades
sin
moderately
together
and
love
each
other
better
than
if
they
wallowed
in
the
sty
of
the
senses
but
no
such
a
relation
was
impossible
with
her
he
concluded
seeing
those
sulphurous
eyes
that
ravenous
despoiling
mouth
she
had
sat
down
in
front
of
his
writing
table
and
was
playing
with
a
penholder
were
you
working
when
i
came
in
where
are
you
in
your
history
of
gilles
de
rais
i
am
getting
along
but
i
am
hampered
to
make
a
good
study
of
the
satanism
of
the
middle
ages
one
ought
to
get
really
into
the
environment
or
at
least
fabricate
a
similar
environment
by
becoming
acquainted
with
the
practitioners
of
satanism
all
about
us
for
the
psychology
is
the
same
though
the
operations
differ
and
looking
her
straight
in
the
eye
thinking
the
story
of
the
child
had
softened
her
he
hazarded
all
on
a
cast
ah
if
your
husband
would
give
me
the
information
he
has
about
canon
docre
she
stood
motionless
but
her
eyes
clouded
over
she
did
not
answer
true
he
said
chantelouve
suspecting
our
liaison
she
interrupted
him
my
husband
has
no
concern
with
the
relations
which
may
exist
between
you
and
me
he
evidently
suffers
when
i
go
out
as
tonight
for
he
knows
where
i
am
going
but
i
admit
no
right
of
control
either
on
his
part
or
mine
he
is
free
and
i
am
free
to
go
wherever
we
please
i
must
keep
house
for
him
watch
out
for
his
interests
take
care
of
him
love
him
like
a
devoted
companion
and
that
i
do
with
all
my
heart
as
to
being
responsible
for
my
acts
they
none
of
his
business
no
more
his
than
anybody
else
she
spoke
in
a
crisp
incisive
tone
the
devil
said
durtal
you
certainly
reduce
the
importance
of
the
rôle
of
husband
i
know
that
my
ideas
are
not
the
ideas
of
the
world
i
live
in
and
they
appear
not
to
be
yours
in
my
first
marriage
they
were
a
source
of
trouble
and
disaster
but
i
have
an
iron
will
and
i
bend
the
people
who
love
me
in
addition
i
despise
deceit
so
when
a
few
years
after
marriage
i
became
smitten
on
a
man
i
quite
frankly
told
my
husband
and
confessed
my
fault
dare
i
ask
you
in
what
spirit
he
received
this
confidence
he
was
so
grieved
that
in
one
night
his
hair
turned
white
he
could
not
bear
what
he
called
wrongly
i
think
my
treason
and
he
killed
himself
ah
said
durtal
dumbfounded
by
the
placid
and
resolute
air
of
this
woman
but
suppose
he
had
strangled
you
first
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
picked
a
cat
hair
off
her
skirt
the
result
he
resumed
after
a
silence
being
that
you
are
now
almost
free
that
your
second
husband
tolerates
let
us
not
discuss
my
second
husband
he
is
an
excellent
man
who
deserves
a
better
wife
i
have
absolutely
no
reason
to
speak
of
chantelouve
otherwise
than
with
praise
and
then
oh
let
talk
of
something
else
for
i
have
had
sufficient
botheration
on
this
subject
from
my
confessor
who
interdicts
me
from
the
holy
table
he
contemplated
her
and
saw
yet
another
hyacinthe
a
hard
pertinacious
woman
whom
he
had
not
known
not
a
sign
nor
an
accent
of
emotion
nothing
while
she
was
describing
the
suicide
of
her
first
husband
she
did
not
even
seem
to
imagine
that
she
had
a
crime
on
her
conscience
she
remained
pitiless
and
yet
a
moment
ago
when
she
was
commiserating
him
because
of
his
fictitious
parenthood
he
had
thought
she
was
trembling
after
all
perhaps
she
is
acting
a
part
like
myself
he
remained
awed
by
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
he
sought
mentally
a
way
of
getting
back
to
the
subject
from
which
hyacinthe
had
diverted
him
of
the
satanism
of
canon
docre
well
let
us
think
of
that
no
more
she
said
coming
very
near
she
smiled
and
was
once
more
the
hyacinthe
he
knew
but
if
on
my
account
you
can
no
longer
take
communion
she
interrupted
him
would
you
be
sorry
if
i
did
not
love
you
and
she
kissed
his
eyes
he
squeezed
her
politely
in
his
arms
but
he
felt
her
trembling
and
from
motives
of
prudence
he
got
away
is
he
so
inexorable
your
confessor
he
is
an
incorruptible
man
of
the
old
school
i
chose
him
expressly
if
i
were
a
woman
it
seems
to
me
i
should
take
on
the
contrary
a
confessor
who
was
pliable
and
caressible
and
who
would
not
violently
pillory
my
dainty
little
sins
i
would
have
him
indulgent
oiling
the
hinges
of
confession
enticing
forth
with
beguiling
gestures
the
misdeeds
that
hung
back
it
is
true
there
would
be
risk
of
seducing
a
confessor
who
perhaps
would
be
defenceless
and
that
would
be
incest
because
the
priest
is
a
spiritual
father
and
it
would
also
be
sacrilege
because
the
priest
is
oh
speaking
to
herself
i
was
mad
mad
suddenly
carried
away
he
observed
her
sparks
glinted
in
the
myopic
eyes
of
this
extraordinary
woman
evidently
he
had
just
stumbled
unwittingly
onto
a
guilty
secret
of
hers
well
and
he
smiled
do
you
still
commit
infidelities
to
me
with
a
false
me
i
do
not
understand
do
you
receive
at
night
the
visit
of
the
incubus
which
resembles
me
no
since
i
have
been
able
to
possess
you
in
the
flesh
i
have
no
need
to
evoke
your
image
what
a
downright
satanist
you
are
maybe
i
have
been
so
constantly
associated
with
priests
you
a
great
one
he
said
bowing
now
listen
to
me
and
do
me
a
great
favour
you
know
canon
docre
i
should
say
well
what
in
the
world
is
this
man
about
whom
i
hear
so
much
from
whom
gévingey
and
des
hermies
ah
you
consult
the
astrologer
yes
he
met
the
canon
in
my
own
house
but
i
did
know
that
docre
was
acquainted
with
des
hermies
who
attend
our
receptions
in
those
days
des
hermies
has
never
seen
docre
he
knows
him
as
i
do
only
by
hearsay
from
gévingey
now
briefly
how
much
truth
is
there
in
the
stories
of
the
sacrileges
of
which
this
priest
is
accused
i
do
know
docre
is
a
gentleman
learned
and
well
bred
he
was
even
the
confessor
of
royalty
and
he
would
certainly
have
become
a
bishop
if
he
had
not
quitted
the
priesthood
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
evil
spoken
about
him
but
especially
in
the
clerical
world
people
are
so
fond
of
saying
all
sorts
of
things
but
you
knew
him
personally
yes
i
even
had
him
for
a
confessor
then
it
is
possible
that
you
do
know
what
to
make
of
him
very
possible
indeed
presumable
look
here
you
have
been
beating
around
the
bush
a
long
time
exactly
what
do
you
want
to
know
everything
you
care
to
tell
me
is
he
young
or
old
handsome
or
ugly
rich
or
poor
he
is
forty
years
old
very
fastidious
of
his
person
and
he
spends
a
lot
of
money
do
you
believe
that
he
indulges
in
sorcery
that
he
celebrates
the
black
mass
it
is
quite
possible
pardon
me
for
dunning
you
for
extorting
information
from
you
as
if
with
forceps
suppose
i
were
to
ask
you
a
really
personal
question
this
faculty
of
incubacy
why
certainly
i
got
it
from
him
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
yes
and
no
thanks
for
your
kindness
in
telling
me
i
know
i
am
abusing
your
good
nature
but
one
more
question
do
you
know
of
any
way
whereby
i
may
see
canon
docre
in
person
he
is
at
nîmes
pardon
me
for
the
moment
he
is
in
paris
ah
you
know
that
well
if
i
knew
of
a
way
i
would
not
tell
you
be
sure
it
would
not
be
good
for
you
to
get
to
seeing
too
much
of
this
priest
you
admit
then
that
he
is
dangerous
i
do
not
admit
nor
deny
i
tell
you
simply
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
yes
i
have
i
want
to
get
material
for
my
book
from
him
get
it
from
somebody
else
besides
she
said
putting
on
her
hat
in
front
of
the
glass
my
husband
got
a
bad
scare
and
broke
with
that
man
and
refuses
to
receive
him
that
is
no
reason
why
what
do
you
mean
oh
nothing
he
repressed
the
remark
why
you
should
not
see
him
she
did
not
insist
she
was
poking
her
hair
under
her
veil
heavens
what
a
fright
i
look
he
took
her
hands
and
kissed
them
when
shall
i
see
you
again
i
thought
i
was
to
come
here
any
more
oh
now
you
know
i
love
you
as
a
good
friend
tell
me
when
will
you
come
again
tomorrow
night
unless
it
is
inconvenient
for
you
not
at
all
then
their
lips
met
and
above
all
do
think
about
canon
docre
she
said
turning
and
shaking
her
finger
at
him
threateningly
as
she
went
out
devil
take
you
and
your
reticence
he
said
to
himself
closing
the
door
after
her
chapter
xvi
when
i
think
said
durtal
to
himself
the
next
morning
that
in
bed
at
the
moment
when
the
most
pertinacious
will
succumbs
i
held
firm
and
refused
to
yield
to
the
instances
of
hyacinthe
wishing
to
establish
a
footing
here
and
that
after
the
carnal
decline
at
that
instant
when
annihilated
man
recovers
alas
his
reason
i
supplicated
her
myself
to
continue
her
visits
why
i
simply
can
not
understand
myself
deep
down
i
have
not
got
over
my
firm
resolution
of
breaking
with
her
but
i
could
not
dismiss
her
like
a
cocotte
and
to
justify
his
inconsistency
i
hoped
to
get
some
information
about
the
canon
oh
on
that
subject
i
am
not
through
with
her
she
got
to
make
up
her
mind
to
speak
out
and
quit
answering
me
by
monosyllables
and
guarded
phrases
as
she
did
yesterday
indeed
what
can
she
have
been
up
to
with
that
abbé
who
was
her
confessor
and
who
by
her
own
admission
launched
her
into
incubacy
she
has
been
his
mistress
that
is
certain
and
how
many
other
of
these
priests
she
has
gone
around
with
have
been
her
lovers
also
for
she
confessed
in
a
cry
that
those
are
the
men
she
loves
ah
if
one
went
about
much
in
the
clerical
world
one
would
doubtless
learn
remarkable
things
concerning
her
and
her
husband
it
is
strange
all
the
same
that
chantelouve
who
plays
a
singular
rôle
in
that
household
has
acquired
a
deplorable
reputation
and
she
has
never
have
i
heard
anybody
speak
of
her
dodges
but
oh
what
a
fool
i
am
it
is
strange
her
husband
does
confine
himself
to
religious
and
polite
circles
he
hobnobs
with
men
of
letters
and
in
consequence
exposes
himself
to
every
sort
of
slander
while
she
if
she
takes
a
lover
chooses
him
out
of
a
pious
society
in
which
not
one
of
us
would
ever
be
received
and
then
abbés
are
discreet
but
how
explain
her
infatuation
with
me
by
the
simple
fact
that
she
is
surfeited
of
priests
and
a
layman
serves
as
a
change
of
diet
just
the
same
she
is
quite
singular
and
the
more
i
see
her
the
less
i
understand
her
there
are
in
her
three
distinct
beings
first
the
woman
seated
or
standing
up
whom
i
knew
in
her
reserved
almost
haughty
who
becomes
a
good
companion
in
private
affectionate
and
even
tender
then
the
woman
in
bed
completely
changed
in
voice
and
bearing
a
harlot
spitting
mud
losing
all
shame
third
and
last
the
pitiless
vixen
the
thorough
satanist
whom
i
perceived
yesterday
what
is
the
that
amalgamates
all
these
beings
of
hers
i
ca
say
hypocrisy
no
doubt
no
i
do
think
so
for
she
is
often
of
a
disconcerting
frankness
in
moments
it
is
true
of
forgetfulness
and
unguardedness
seriously
what
is
the
use
of
trying
to
understand
the
character
of
this
pious
harlot
and
to
be
candid
with
myself
what
i
wish
ideally
will
never
be
realized
she
does
not
ask
me
to
take
her
to
swell
places
does
not
force
me
to
dine
with
her
exacts
no
revenue
she
is
trying
to
compromise
and
blackmail
me
i
sha
find
a
better
but
oh
lord
i
now
prefer
to
find
no
one
at
all
it
suits
me
perfectly
to
entrust
my
carnal
business
to
mercenary
agents
for
my
twenty
francs
i
shall
receive
more
considerate
treatment
there
is
no
getting
around
it
only
professionals
know
how
to
cook
up
a
delicious
sensual
dish
odd
he
said
to
himself
after
a
reflective
silence
but
all
proportions
duly
observed
gilles
de
rais
divides
himself
like
her
into
three
different
persons
first
the
brave
and
honest
fighting
man
then
the
refined
and
artistic
criminal
finally
the
repentant
sinner
the
mystic
he
is
a
mass
of
contradictions
and
excesses
viewing
his
life
as
a
whole
one
finds
each
of
his
vices
compensated
by
a
contradictory
virtue
but
there
is
no
key
characteristic
which
reconciles
them
he
is
of
an
overweening
arrogance
but
when
contrition
takes
possession
of
him
he
falls
on
his
knees
in
front
of
the
people
of
low
estate
and
has
the
tears
the
humility
of
a
saint
his
ferocity
passes
the
limits
of
the
human
scale
and
yet
he
is
generous
and
sincerely
devoted
to
his
friends
whom
he
cares
for
like
a
brother
when
the
demon
has
mauled
them
impetuous
in
his
desires
and
nevertheless
patient
brave
in
battle
a
coward
confronting
eternity
he
is
despotic
and
violent
yet
he
is
putty
in
the
hands
of
his
flatterers
he
is
now
in
the
clouds
now
in
the
abyss
never
on
the
trodden
plain
the
lowlands
of
the
soul
his
confessions
do
not
throw
any
light
on
his
invariable
tendency
to
extremes
when
asked
who
suggested
to
him
the
idea
of
such
crimes
he
answers
one
the
thought
came
to
me
only
from
myself
from
my
reveries
my
daily
pleasures
my
taste
for
debauchery
and
he
arraigns
his
indolence
and
constantly
asserts
that
delicate
repasts
and
strong
drink
have
helped
uncage
the
wild
animal
in
him
unresponsive
to
mediocre
passions
he
is
carried
away
alternately
by
good
as
well
as
evil
and
he
bounds
from
spiritual
pole
to
spiritual
pole
he
dies
at
the
age
of
but
he
has
completely
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
joy
and
grief
he
has
adored
death
loved
as
a
vampire
kissed
inimitable
expressions
of
suffering
and
terror
and
has
himself
been
racked
by
implacable
remorse
insatiable
fear
he
has
nothing
more
to
try
nothing
more
to
learn
here
below
let
see
said
durtal
running
over
his
notes
i
left
him
at
the
moment
when
the
expiation
begins
as
i
had
written
in
one
of
my
preceding
chapters
the
inhabitants
of
the
region
dominated
by
the
châteaux
of
the
marshal
know
now
who
the
inconceivable
monster
is
who
carries
children
off
and
cuts
their
throats
but
no
one
dare
speak
when
at
a
turn
in
the
road
the
tall
figure
of
the
butcher
is
seen
approaching
all
flee
huddle
behind
the
hedges
or
shut
themselves
up
in
the
cottages
and
gilles
passes
haughty
and
sombre
in
the
solitude
of
villages
where
no
one
dares
venture
abroad
impunity
seems
assured
him
for
what
peasant
would
be
mad
enough
to
attack
a
master
who
could
have
him
gibbeted
at
a
word
again
if
the
humble
give
up
the
idea
of
bringing
gilles
de
rais
to
justice
his
peers
have
no
intention
of
combating
him
for
the
benefit
of
peasants
whom
they
disdain
and
his
liege
the
duke
of
brittany
jean
v
burdens
him
with
favours
and
blandishments
in
order
to
extort
his
lands
from
him
at
a
low
price
a
single
power
can
rise
and
above
feudal
complicities
above
earthly
interest
avenge
the
oppressed
and
the
weak
the
church
and
it
is
the
church
in
fact
in
the
person
of
jean
de
malestroit
which
rises
up
before
the
monster
and
fells
him
jean
de
malestroit
bishop
of
nantes
belongs
to
an
illustrious
line
he
is
a
near
kinsman
of
jean
v
and
his
incomparable
piety
his
infallible
christian
wisdom
and
his
enthusiastic
charity
make
him
venerated
even
by
the
duke
the
wailing
of
gilles
decimated
flock
reaches
his
ears
in
silence
he
begins
an
investigation
and
setting
spies
upon
the
marshal
waits
only
for
an
opportune
moment
to
begin
the
combat
and
gilles
suddenly
commits
an
inexplicable
crime
which
permits
the
bishop
to
march
forthwith
upon
him
and
smite
him
to
recuperate
his
shattered
fortune
gilles
has
sold
his
signorie
of
saint
etienne
de
mer
morte
to
a
subject
of
jean
v
guillaume
le
ferron
who
delegates
his
brother
jean
le
ferron
to
take
possession
of
the
domain
some
days
later
the
marshal
gathers
the
two
hundred
men
of
his
military
household
and
at
their
head
marches
on
saint
etienne
there
the
day
of
pentecost
when
the
assembled
people
are
hearing
mass
he
precipitates
himself
sword
in
hand
into
the
church
sweeps
aside
the
faithful
throwing
them
into
tumult
and
before
the
dumbfounded
priest
threatens
to
cleave
jean
le
ferron
who
is
praying
the
ceremony
is
broken
off
the
congregation
take
flight
gilles
drags
le
ferron
pleading
for
mercy
to
the
château
orders
that
the
drawbridge
be
let
down
and
by
force
occupies
the
place
while
his
prisoner
is
carried
away
to
tiffauges
and
thrown
into
an
underground
dungeon
gilles
has
at
one
and
the
same
time
violated
the
unwritten
law
of
brittany
forbidding
any
baron
to
raise
troops
without
the
consent
of
the
duke
and
committed
double
sacrilege
in
profaning
a
chapel
and
seizing
jean
le
ferron
who
is
a
tonsured
clerk
of
the
church
the
bishop
learns
of
this
outrage
and
prevails
upon
the
reluctant
jean
v
to
march
against
the
rebel
then
while
one
army
advances
on
saint
etienne
which
gilles
abandons
to
take
refuge
with
his
little
band
in
the
fortified
manor
of
mâchecoul
another
army
lays
siege
to
tiffauges
during
this
time
the
priest
hastens
his
redoubled
investigations
he
delegates
commissioners
and
procurators
in
all
the
villages
where
children
have
disappeared
he
himself
quits
his
palace
at
nantes
travels
about
the
countryside
and
takes
the
depositions
of
the
bereft
the
people
at
last
speak
and
on
their
knees
beseech
the
bishop
to
protect
them
enraged
by
the
atrocities
which
they
reveal
he
swears
that
justice
shall
be
done
it
takes
a
month
to
hear
all
the
reports
by
jean
de
malestroit
establishes
publicly
the
of
gilles
then
when
all
the
forms
of
canonic
procedure
have
been
gone
through
with
he
launches
the
mandate
of
arrest
in
this
writ
of
warrant
given
at
nantes
the
day
of
september
in
the
year
of
our
lord
the
bishop
notes
all
the
crimes
imputed
to
the
marshal
then
in
an
energetic
style
he
commands
his
diocese
to
march
against
the
assassin
and
dislodge
him
we
do
enjoin
you
each
and
all
individually
by
these
presents
that
ye
cite
immediately
and
peremptorily
without
counting
any
man
upon
his
neighbor
without
discharging
the
burden
any
man
upon
his
neighbour
that
ye
cite
before
us
or
before
the
official
of
our
cathedral
church
for
monday
of
the
feast
of
exaltation
of
the
holy
cross
the
of
september
gilles
noble
baron
de
rais
subject
to
our
puissance
and
to
our
jurisdiction
and
we
do
ourselves
cite
him
by
these
presents
to
appear
before
our
bar
to
answer
for
the
crimes
which
weigh
upon
him
execute
these
orders
and
do
each
of
you
cause
them
to
be
executed
and
the
next
day
the
jean
labbé
acting
in
the
name
of
the
duke
and
robin
guillaumet
notary
acting
in
the
name
of
the
bishop
present
themselves
escorted
by
a
small
troop
before
the
château
of
mâchecoul
what
sudden
change
of
heart
does
the
marshal
now
experience
too
feeble
to
hold
his
own
in
the
open
field
he
can
nevertheless
defend
himself
behind
the
sheltering
ramparts
yet
he
surrenders
roger
de
bricqueville
and
gilles
de
sillé
his
trusted
councillors
have
taken
flight
he
remains
alone
with
prelati
who
also
attempts
in
vain
to
escape
he
like
gilles
is
loaded
with
chains
robin
guillaumet
searches
the
fortress
from
top
to
bottom
he
discovers
bloody
clothes
imperfectly
calcinated
ashes
which
prelati
has
not
had
time
to
throw
into
the
latrines
amid
universal
maledictions
and
cries
of
horror
gilles
and
his
servitors
are
conducted
to
nîmes
and
incarcerated
in
the
château
de
la
tour
neuve
now
this
part
is
not
very
clear
said
durtal
to
himself
remembering
what
a
daredevil
the
marshal
had
been
how
can
we
reconcile
ourselves
to
the
idea
that
he
could
give
himself
up
to
certain
death
and
torture
without
striking
a
blow
he
softened
weakened
by
his
nights
of
debauchery
terrified
by
the
audacity
of
his
own
sacrileges
ravaged
and
torn
by
remorse
was
he
tired
of
living
as
he
did
and
did
he
give
himself
up
as
so
many
murderers
do
because
he
was
irresistibly
attracted
to
punishment
nobody
knows
did
he
think
himself
above
the
law
because
of
his
lofty
rank
or
did
he
hope
to
disarm
the
duke
by
playing
upon
his
venality
offering
him
a
ransom
of
manors
and
farm
land
one
answer
is
as
plausible
as
another
he
may
also
have
known
how
hesitant
jean
v
had
been
for
fear
of
rousing
the
wrath
of
the
nobility
of
his
duchy
about
yielding
to
the
objurgations
of
the
bishop
and
raising
troops
for
the
pursuit
and
arrest
well
there
is
no
document
which
answers
these
questions
an
author
can
take
some
liberties
here
and
set
down
his
own
conjectures
but
that
curious
trial
is
going
to
give
me
some
trouble
as
soon
as
gilles
and
his
accomplices
are
incarcerated
two
tribunals
are
organized
one
ecclesiastical
to
judge
the
crimes
coming
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
church
the
other
civil
to
judge
those
on
which
the
state
must
pass
to
tell
the
truth
the
civil
tribunal
which
is
present
at
the
ecclesiastical
hearings
effaces
itself
completely
as
a
matter
of
form
it
makes
a
brief
but
it
pronounces
the
sentence
of
death
which
the
church
can
not
permit
itself
to
utter
according
to
the
old
adage
abhorret
a
the
ecclesiastical
trial
lasts
five
weeks
the
civil
hours
it
seems
that
to
hide
behind
the
robes
of
the
bishop
the
duke
of
brittany
has
voluntarily
subordinated
the
rôle
of
civil
justice
which
ordinarily
stands
up
for
its
rights
against
the
encroachments
of
the
ecclesiastical
court
jean
de
malestroit
presides
over
the
hearings
he
chooses
for
assistants
the
bishops
of
mans
of
saint
brieuc
and
of
saint
lô
then
in
addition
he
surrounds
himself
with
a
troop
of
jurists
who
work
in
relays
in
the
interminable
sessions
of
the
trial
some
of
the
more
important
are
guillaume
de
montigné
advocate
of
the
secular
court
jean
blanchet
bachelor
of
laws
guillaume
groyguet
and
robert
de

who
is
to

civil
hearings
after
the
canonic
judgment
assists
jean

the
public
prosecutor
is
guillaume
chapeiron
curate
of
saint
nicolas
an
eloquent
and
subtile
man
adjunct
to
him
to
relieve
him
of
the
fatigue
of
the
readings
are
geoffroy
pipraire
dean
of
sainte
marie
and
jacques
de
pentcoetdic
official
of
the
church
of
nantes
in
connection
with
the
episcopal
jurisdiction
the
church
has
called
in
the
assistance
of
the
extraordinary
tribunal
of
the
inquisition
for
the
repression
of
the
crime
of
heresy
then
comprehending
perjury
blasphemy
sacrilege
all
the
crimes
of
magic
it
sits
at
the
side
of
jean
de
malestroit
in
the
redoubtable
and
learned
person
of
jean
blouyn
of
the
order
of
saint
dominic
delegated
by
the
grand
inquisitor
of
france
guillaume
merici
to
the
functions
of
vice
inquisitor
of
the
city
and
diocese
of
nantes
the
tribunal
constituted
the
trial
opens
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
because
judges
and
witnesses
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
times
must
proceed
fasting
to
the
giving
and
hearing
of
evidence
the
testimony
of
the
parents
of
the
victims
is
heard
and
robin
guillaumet
acting
the
man
who
arrested
the
marshal
at
mâchecoul
reads
the
citation
bidding
gilles
de
rais
appear
he
is
brought
in
and
declares
disdainfully
that
he
does
not
recognize
the
competence
of
the
tribunal
but
as
canonic
procedure
demands
the
prosecutor
at
once
order
that
by
this
means
the
correction
of
sorcery
be
not
prevented
petitions
for
and
obtains
from
the
tribunal
a
ruling
that
this
objection
be
quashed
as
being
null
in
law
and
he
begins
to
read
to
the
accused
the
counts
on
which
he
is
to
be
tried
gilles
cries
out
that
the
prosecutor
is
a
liar
and
a
traitor
then
guillaume
chapeiron
extends
his
hand
toward
the
crucifix
swears
that
he
is
telling
the
truth
and
challenges
the
marshal
to
take
the
same
oath
but
this
man
who
has
recoiled
from
no
sacrilege
is
troubled
he
refuses
to
perjure
himself
before
god
and
the
session
ends
with
gilles
still
vociferating
outrageous
denunciations
of
the
prosecutor
the
preliminaries
completed
a
few
days
later
the
public
hearings
begin
the
act
of
indictment
is
read
aloud
to
the
accused
in
front
of
an
audience
who
shudder
when
chapeiron
indefatigably
enumerates
the
crimes
one
by
one
and
formally
accuses
the
marshal
of
having
practised
sorcery
and
magic
of
having
polluted
and
slain
little
children
of
having
violated
the
immunities
of
holy
church
at
saint
etienne
de
mer
morte
then
after
a
silence
he
resumes
his
discourse
and
making
no
account
of
the
murders
but
dwelling
only
on
the
crimes
of
which
the
punishment
foreseen
by
canonic
law
can
be
fixed
by
the
church
he
demands
that
gilles
be
smitten
with
double
excommunication
first
as
an
evoker
of
demons
a
heretic
apostate
and
renegade
second
as
a
sodomist
and
perpetrator
of
sacrilege
gilles
who
has
listened
to
this
incisive
and
scathing
indictment
completely
loses
control
of
himself
he
insults
the
judges
calls
them
simonists
and
ribalds
and
refuses
to
answer
the
questions
put
to
him
the
prosecutor
and
advocates
are
unmoved
they
invite
him
to
present
his
defence
again
he
denounces
them
insults
them
but
when
called
upon
to
refute
them
he
remains
silent
the
bishop
and
vice
inquisitor
declare
him
in
contempt
and
pronounce
against
him
the
sentence
of
excommunication
which
is
soon
made
public
they
decide
in
addition
that
the
hearing
shall
be
continued
next
day
a
ring
of
the
doorbell
interrupted
durtal
perusal
of
his
notes
des
hermies
entered
i
have
just
seen
carhaix
he
is
ill
he
said
that
so
what
seems
to
be
the
matter
nothing
very
serious
a
slight
attack
of
bronchitis
he
be
up
in
a
few
days
if
he
will
consent
to
keep
quiet
i
must
go
see
him
tomorrow
said
durtal
and
what
are
you
doing
enquired
des
hermies
working
hard
why
yes
i
am
digging
into
the
trial
of
the
noble
baron
de
rais
it
will
be
as
tedious
to
read
as
to
write
and
you
do
know
yet
when
you
will
finish
your
volume
no
answered
durtal
stretching
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
wish
it
might
never
be
finished
what
will
become
of
me
when
it
is
i
have
to
look
around
for
another
subject
and
when
i
find
one
do
all
the
drudgery
of
planning
and
then
getting
the
introductory
chapter
written
the
mean
part
of
any
literary
work
is
getting
started
i
shall
pass
mortal
hours
doing
nothing
really
when
i
think
it
over
literature
has
only
one
excuse
for
existing
it
saves
the
person
who
makes
it
from
the
disgustingness
of
life
and
charitably
it
lessens
the
distress
of
us
few
who
still
love
art
few
indeed
and
the
number
keeps
diminishing
the
new
generation
no
longer
interests
itself
in
anything
except
gambling
and
jockeys
yes
you
quite
right
the
men
ca
spare
from
gambling
the
time
to
read
so
it
is
only
the
society
women
who
buy
books
and
pass
judgment
on
them
it
is
to
the
lady
as
schopenhauer
called
her
to
the
little
goose
as
i
should
characterize
her
that
we
are
indebted
for
these
shoals
of
lukewarm
and
mucilaginous
novels
which
nowadays
get
puffed
you
think
then
that
we
are
in
for
a
pretty
literature
naturally
you
ca
please
women
by
enunciating
vigorous
ideas
in
a
crisp
style
but
durtal
went
on
after
a
silence
it
is
perhaps
best
that
the
case
should
be
as
it
is
the
rare
artists
who
remain
have
no
business
to
be
thinking
about
the
public
the
artist
lives
and
works
far
from
the
far
from
the
clamour
of
the
little
fellows
who
fix
up
the
literature
the
only
legitimate
source
of
vexation
to
an
author
is
to
see
his
work
when
printed
exposed
to
the
contaminating
curiosity
of
the
crowd
that
is
said
des
hermies
a
veritable
prostitution
to
advertise
a
thing
for
sale
is
to
accept
the
degrading
familiarities
of
the
first
comer
but
our
impenitent
pride
and
also
our
need
of
the
miserable
sous
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
keep
our
manuscripts
sheltered
from
the
asses
art
ought
to
be
like
one
beloved
out
of
reach
out
of
the
world
art
and
prayer
are
the
only
decent
ejaculations
of
the
soul
so
when
one
of
my
books
appears
i
let
go
of
it
with
horror
i
get
as
far
as
possible
from
the
environment
in
which
it
may
be
supposed
to
circulate
i
care
very
little
about
a
book
of
mine
until
years
afterward
when
it
has
disappeared
from
all
the
shop
windows
and
is
out
of
print
briefly
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
finish
the
history
of
gilles
de
rais
which
unfortunately
is
getting
finished
in
spite
of
me
i
do
give
a
damn
how
it
is
received
are
you
doing
anything
this
evening
no
why
shall
we
dine
together
certainly
and
while
durtal
was
putting
on
his
shoes
des
hermies
remarked
to
me
the
striking
thing
about
the
literary
world
of
this
epoch
is
its
cheap
hypocrisy
what
a
lot
of
laziness
for
instance
that
word
dilettante
has
served
to
cover
yes
it
a
great
old
alibi
but
it
is
confounding
to
see
that
the
critic
who
today
decrees
himself
the
title
of
dilettante
accepts
it
as
a
term
of
praise
and
does
not
even
suspect
that
he
is
slapping
himself
the
whole
thing
can
be
resolved
into
syllogism
the
dilettante
has
no
personal
temperament
since
he
objects
to
nothing
and
likes
everything
whoever
has
no
personal
temperament
has
no
talent
then
rejoined
des
hermies
putting
on
his
hat
an
author
who
boasts
of
being
a
dilettante
confesses
by
that
very
thing
that
he
is
no
author
exactly
chapter
xvii
toward
the
end
of
the
afternoon
durtal
quit
work
and
went
up
to
the
towers
of
saint
sulpice
he
found
carhaix
in
bed
in
a
chamber
connecting
with
the
one
in
which
they
were
in
the
habit
of
dining
these
rooms
were
very
similar
with
their
walls
or
unpapered
stone
and
with
their
vaulted
ceilings
only
the
bedroom
was
darker
the
window
opened
its
not
on
the
place
saint
sulpice
but
on
the
rear
of
the
church
whose
roof
prevented
any
light
from
getting
in
this
cell
was
furnished
with
an
iron
bed
whose
springs
shrieked
with
two
cane
chairs
and
with
a
table
that
had
a
shabby
covering
of
green
baize
on
the
bare
wall
was
a
crucifix
of
no
value
with
a
dry
palm
over
it
that
was
all
carhaix
was
sitting
up
in
bed
reading
with
books
and
papers
piled
all
around
him
his
eyes
were
more
watery
and
his
face
paler
than
usual
his
beard
which
had
not
been
shaved
for
several
days
grew
in
grey
clumps
on
his
hollow
cheeks
but
his
poor
features
were
radiant
with
an
affectionate
affable
smile
to
durtal
questions
he
replied
it
is
nothing
des
hermies
gives
me
permission
to
get
up
tomorrow
but
what
a
frightful
medicine
and
he
showed
durtal
a
potion
of
which
he
had
to
take
a
teaspoonful
every
hour
what
is
it
he
making
you
take
but
the
did
not
know
doubtless
to
spare
him
the
expense
des
hermies
himself
always
brought
the
bottle
is
it
tiresome
lying
in
bed
i
should
say
i
am
obliged
to
entrust
my
bells
to
an
assistant
who
is
no
good
ah
if
you
heard
him
ring
it
makes
me
shudder
it
sets
my
teeth
on
edge
now
you
must
work
yourself
up
said
his
wife
in
two
days
you
will
be
able
to
ring
your
bells
yourself
but
he
went
on
complaining
you
two
do
understand
my
bells
are
used
to
being
well
treated
they
like
domestic
animals
those
instruments
and
they
obey
only
their
master
now
they
wo
harmonize
they
jangle
i
can
hardly
recognize
their
voices
what
are
you
reading
asked
durtal
wishing
to
change
a
subject
which
he
judged
to
be
dangerous
books
about
bells
ah
monsieur
durtal
i
have
some
inscriptions
here
of
truly
rare
beauty
listen
and
he
opened
a
book
listen
to
this
motto
printed
in
raised
letters
on
the
bronze
robe
of
the
great
bell
of
schaffhausen
call
the
living
i
mourn
the
dead
i
break
the
thunder
and
this
other
which
figured
on
an
old
bell
in
the
belfry
of
ghent
name
is
roland
when
i
toll
there
is
a
fire
when
i
peal
there
is
a
tempest
in
flanders
yes
durtal
agreed
there
is
a
certain
vigour
about
that
one
ah
said
carhaix
seeming
not
to
have
heard
the
other
remark
ridiculous
now
the
rich
have
their
names
and
titles
inscribed
on
the
bells
which
they
give
to
the
churches
but
they
have
so
many
qualities
and
titles
that
there
is
no
room
for
a
motto
truly
humility
is
a
forgotten
virtue
in
our
day
if
that
were
the
only
forgotten
virtue
sighed
durtal
ah
replied
carhaix
not
to
be
turned
from
his
favourite
subject
and
if
this
were
the
only
abuse
but
bells
now
rust
from
inactivity
the
metal
is
no
longer
and
is
not
vibrant
formerly
these
magnificent
auxiliaries
of
the
ritual
sang
without
cease
the
canonical
hours
were
sounded
matins
and
laudes
before
daybreak
prime
at
dawn
tierce
at
nine
sexte
at
noon
nones
at
three
and
then
vespers
and
compline
now
we
announce
the
curate
mass
ring
three
angeluses
morning
noon
and
evening
occasionally
a
salute
and
on
certain
days
launch
a
few
peals
for
prescribed
ceremonies
and
that
all
it
only
in
the
convents
where
the
bells
do
not
sleep
for
these
at
least
the
night
offices
are
kept
up
you
must
talk
about
that
said
his
wife
straightening
the
pillows
at
his
back
if
you
keep
working
yourself
up
you
will
never
get
well
quite
right
he
said
resigned
but
what
would
you
have
i
shall
still
be
a
man
with
a
grievance
whom
nothing
can
pacify
and
he
smiled
at
his
wife
who
was
bringing
him
a
spoonful
of
the
potion
to
swallow
the
doorbell
rang
mme
carhaix
went
to
answer
it
and
a
hilarious
and
priest
entered
crying
in
a
great
voice
it
jacob
ladder
that
stairway
i
climbed
and
climbed
and
climbed
and
i
all
out
of
breath
and
he
sank
puffing
into
an
armchair
well
my
friend
he
said
at
last
coming
into
the
bedroom
i
learned
from
the
beadle
that
you
were
ill
and
i
came
to
see
how
you
were
getting
on
durtal
examined
him
an
irrepressible
gaiety
exuded
from
this
sanguine
face
blue
from
the
razor
carhaix
introduced
them
they
exchanged
a
look
of
distrust
on
the
priest
side
of
coldness
on
durtal
durtal
felt
embarrassed
and
in
the
way
while
the
honest
pair
were
effusively
and
with
excessive
humility
thanking
the
abbé
for
coming
up
to
see
them
it
was
evident
that
for
this
pair
who
were
not
ignorant
of
the
sacrileges
and
scandalous
of
the
clergy
an
ecclesiastic
was
a
man
elect
a
man
so
superior
that
as
soon
as
he
arrived
nobody
else
counted
durtal
took
his
leave
and
as
he
went
downstairs
he
thought
that
jubilant
priest
sickens
me
indeed
a
gay
priest
physician
or
man
of
letters
must
have
an
infamous
soul
because
they
are
the
ones
who
see
clearly
into
human
misery
and
console
it
or
heal
it
or
depict
it
if
after
that
they
can
act
the
clown
they
are
unspeakable
though
admit
that
thoughtless
persons
deplore
the
sadness
of
the
novel
of
observation
and
its
resemblance
to
the
life
it
represents
these
people
would
have
it
jovial
smart
highly
coloured
aiding
them
in
their
base
selfishness
to
forget
the
existences
of
their
brothers
truly
carhaix
and
his
wife
are
peculiar
they
bow
under
the
paternal
despotism
of
the
priests
and
there
are
moments
when
that
same
despotism
must
be
no
joke
and
revere
them
and
adore
them
but
then
these
two
are
simple
believers
with
humble
unsmirched
souls
i
do
know
the
priest
who
was
there
but
he
is
rotund
and
rubicund
he
shakes
in
his
fat
and
seems
bursting
with
joy
despite
the
example
of
saint
francis
of
assisi
who
was
gay
spoiling
him
for
me
i
have
difficulty
in
persuading
myself
that
this
abbé
is
an
elevated
being
it
all
right
to
say
that
the
best
thing
for
him
is
to
be
mediocre
to
ask
how
if
he
were
otherwise
he
would
make
his
flock
understand
him
and
add
that
if
he
really
had
superior
gifts
he
would
be
hated
by
his
colleagues
and
persecuted
by
his
bishop
while
conversing
thus
disjointedly
with
himself
durtal
had
reached
the
base
of
the
tower
he
stopped
under
the
porch
i
intended
to
stay
longer
up
there
thought
he
it
only
five
i
must
kill
at
least
half
an
hour
before
dinner
the
weather
was
almost
mild
the
clouds
had
been
swept
away
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
strolled
about
the
square
musing
looking
up
he
hunted
for
the
window
and
recognized
it
of
the
windows
which
opened
over
the
portico
it
alone
had
a
curtain
what
an
abominable
construction
he
thought
contemplating
the
church
think
that
cube
flanked
by
two
towers
presumes
to
invite
comparison
with
the
façade
of
notre
dame
what
a
jumble
he
continued
examining
the
details
from
the
foundation
to
the
first
story
are
ionic
columns
with
volutes
then
from
the
base
of
the
tower
to
the
summit
are
corinthian
columns
with
acanthus
leaves
what
significance
can
this
salmagundi
of
pagan
orders
have
on
a
christian
church
and
as
a
rebuke
to
the
bell
tower
there
stands
the
other
tower
unfinished
looking
like
an
abandoned
grain
elevator
but
the
less
hideous
of
the
two
at
that
and
it
took
five
or
six
architects
to
erect
this
indigent
heap
of
stones
yet
servandoni
and
oppenord
and
their
ilk
were
the
real
major
prophets
the
zekiels
of
building
their
work
is
the
work
of
seers
looking
beyond
the
eighteenth
century
to
the
day
of
transportation
by
steam
for
saint
sulpice
is
not
a
church
it
a
railway
station
and
the
interior
of
the
edifice
is
not
more
religious
nor
artistic
than
the
exterior
the
only
thing
in
it
that
pleases
me
is
good
aërial
cave
then
he
looked
about
him
this
square
is
very
ugly
but
how
provincial
and
homelike
it
is
surely
nothing
could
equal
the
hideousness
of
that
seminary
which
exhales
the
rancid
frozen
odour
of
a
hospital
the
fountain
with
its
polygonal
basins
its
saucepan
urns
its
spouts
its
niches
with
prelates
in
them
is
no
masterpiece
neither
is
the
city
hall
whose
administrative
style
is
a
cinder
in
the
eye
but
on
this
square
as
in
the
neighbouring
streets
servandoni
garancière
and
ferrou
one
respires
an
atmosphere
compounded
of
benign
silence
and
mild
humidity
you
think
of
a
that
has
been
open
for
years
and
somehow
of
incense
this
square
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
houses
in
the
decayed
streets
around
here
with
the
shops
where
religious
paraphernalia
are
sold
the
image
and
ciborium
factories
the
catholic
bookstores
with
books
whose
covers
are
the
colour
of
apple
seeds
macadam
nutmeg
bluing
yes
it
dilapidated
and
quiet
the
square
was
then
almost
deserted
a
few
women
were
going
up
the
church
steps
met
by
mendicants
who
murmured
paternosters
as
they
rattled
their
tin
cups
an
ecclesiastic
carrying
under
his
arm
a
book
bound
in
black
cloth
saluted
women
a
few
dogs
were
running
about
children
were
chasing
each
other
or
jumping
rope
the
enormous
la
villette
omnibus
and
the
little
bus
of
the
auteuil
line
went
past
almost
empty
hackmen
were
standing
beside
their
hacks
on
the
sidewalk
or
in
a
group
around
a
comfort
station
talking
there
were
no
crowds
no
noise
and
the
great
trees
gave
the
square
the
appearance
of
the
silent
mall
of
a
little
town
well
said
durtal
considering
the
church
again
i
really
must
go
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
some
clear
day
then
he
shook
his
head
what
for
a
view
of
paris
would
have
been
interesting
in
the
middle
ages
but
now
i
should
see
as
from
a
hill
top
other
heights
a
network
of
grey
streets
the
whiter
arteries
of
the
boulevards
the
green
plaques
of
gardens
and
squares
and
away
in
the
distance
files
of
houses
like
lines
of
dominoes
stood
up
on
end
the
black
dots
being
windows
and
then
the
edifices
emerging
from
this
jumble
of
roofs
notre
dame
la
sainte
chapelle
saint
severin
saint
etienne
du
mont
the
tour
saint
jacques
are
put
out
of
countenance
by
the
deplorable
mass
of
newer
edifices
and
i
am
not
at
all
eager
to
contemplate
that
specimen
of
the
art
of
the
maker
of
toilet
articles
which
is
nor
that
bridge
arch
de
la
triomphe
nor
that
hollow
chandelier
the
tour
eiffel
it
enough
to
see
them
separately
from
the
ground
as
you
turn
a
street
corner
well
i
must
go
and
dine
for
i
have
an
engagement
with
hyacinthe
and
i
must
be
back
before
eight
he
went
to
a
neighbouring
wine
shop
where
the
depopulated
at
six
permitted
one
to
ruminate
in
tranquillity
while
eating
fairly
sanitary
food
and
drinking
not
too
dangerously
coloured
wines
he
was
thinking
of
mme
chantelouve
but
more
of
docre
the
mystery
of
this
priest
haunted
him
what
could
be
going
on
in
the
soul
of
a
man
who
had
had
the
figure
of
christ
tattooed
on
his
heels
the
better
to
trample
him
what
hate
the
act
revealed
did
docre
hate
god
for
not
having
given
him
the
blessed
ecstasies
of
a
saint
or
more
humanly
for
not
having
raised
him
to
the
highest
ecclesiastical
dignities
evidently
the
spite
of
this
priest
was
inordinate
and
his
pride
unlimited
he
seemed
not
displeased
to
be
an
object
of
terror
and
loathing
for
thus
he
was
somebody
then
for
a
scoundrel
as
this
man
seemed
to
be
what
delight
to
make
his
enemies
languish
in
slow
torment
by
casting
spells
on
them
with
perfect
impunity
and
sacrilege
carries
one
out
of
oneself
in
furious
transports
in
voluptuous
delirium
which
nothing
can
equal
since
the
middle
ages
it
has
been
the
coward
crime
for
human
justice
does
not
prosecute
it
and
one
can
commit
it
with
impunity
but
it
is
the
most
extreme
of
excesses
for
a
believer
and
docre
believes
in
christ
or
he
hate
him
so
a
monster
and
what
ignoble
relations
he
must
have
had
with
chantelouve
wife
now
how
shall
i
make
her
speak
up
she
gave
me
quite
clearly
to
understand
the
other
day
that
she
refused
to
explain
herself
on
this
topic
meanwhile
as
i
have
not
intention
of
submitting
to
her
young
girl
follies
tonight
i
will
tell
her
that
i
am
not
feeling
well
and
that
absolute
rest
and
quiet
are
necessary
he
did
so
an
hour
later
when
she
came
in
she
proposed
a
cup
of
tea
and
when
he
refused
she
embraced
him
and
nursed
him
like
a
baby
then
withdrawing
a
little
you
work
too
hard
you
need
some
relaxation
come
now
to
pass
the
time
you
might
court
me
a
little
because
up
to
now
i
have
done
it
all
no
that
idea
does
not
amuse
him
let
us
try
something
else
shall
we
play
with
the
cat
he
shrugs
his
shoulders
well
since
there
is
nothing
to
change
your
grouchy
expression
let
us
talk
what
has
become
of
your
friend
des
hermies
nothing
in
particular
and
his
experiments
with
mattei
medicine
i
do
know
whether
he
continues
to
prosecute
them
or
not
well
i
see
that
the
conversational
possibilities
of
that
topic
are
exhausted
you
know
your
replies
are
not
very
encouraging
dear
but
he
said
everybody
sometimes
gets
so
he
does
answer
questions
at
great
length
i
even
know
a
young
woman
who
becomes
excessively
laconic
when
interrogated
on
a
certain
subject
of
a
canon
for
instance
precisely
she
crossed
her
legs
very
coolly
that
young
woman
undoubtedly
had
reasons
for
keeping
still
but
perhaps
that
young
woman
is
really
eager
to
oblige
the
person
who
her
perhaps
since
she
last
saw
him
she
has
gone
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
look
here
hyacinthe
darling
explain
yourself
he
said
squeezing
her
hands
an
expression
of
joy
on
his
face
if
i
have
made
your
mouth
water
so
as
not
to
have
a
grouchy
face
in
front
of
my
eyes
i
have
succeeded
remarkably
he
kept
still
wondering
whether
she
was
making
fun
of
him
or
whether
she
really
was
ready
to
tell
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
listen
she
said
i
hold
firmly
by
my
decision
of
the
other
night
i
will
not
permit
you
to
become
acquainted
with
canon
docre
but
at
a
settled
time
i
can
arrange
without
your
forming
any
relations
with
him
to
have
you
be
present
at
the
ceremony
you
most
desire
to
know
about
the
black
mass
yes
within
a
week
docre
will
have
left
paris
if
once
in
my
company
you
see
him
you
will
never
see
him
afterward
keep
your
evenings
free
all
this
week
when
the
time
comes
i
will
notify
you
but
you
may
thank
me
dear
because
to
be
useful
to
you
i
am
disobeying
the
commands
of
my
confessor
whom
i
dare
not
see
now
so
i
am
damning
myself
he
kissed
her
then
seriously
that
man
is
really
a
monster
i
fear
so
in
any
case
i
would
not
wish
anybody
the
misfortune
of
having
him
for
an
enemy
i
should
say
not
if
he
poisons
people
by
magic
as
he
seems
to
have
done
gévingey
and
he
probably
has
i
should
not
like
to
be
in
the
shoes
you
believe
in
docre
potency
then
tell
me
how
does
he
operate
with
the
blood
of
mice
with
broths
or
with
oil
so
you
know
about
that
he
does
employ
these
substances
in
fact
he
is
one
of
the
very
few
persons
who
know
how
to
manage
them
without
poisoning
themselves
it
as
dangerous
as
working
with
explosives
frequently
though
when
attacking
defenceless
persons
he
uses
simpler
recipes
he
distils
extracts
of
poison
and
adds
sulphuric
acid
to
fester
the
wound
then
he
dips
in
this
compound
the
point
of
a
lancet
with
which
he
has
his
victim
pricked
by
a
flying
spirit
or
a
larva
it
is
ordinary
magic
that
of
rosicrucians
and
tyros
durtal
burst
out
laughing
but
my
dear
to
hear
you
one
would
think
death
could
be
sent
to
a
distance
like
a
letter
well
is
cholera
transmitted
by
letters
ask
the
sanitary
corps
do
they
disinfect
all
mail
in
the
time
of
epidemics
i
do
contradict
that
but
the
case
is
not
the
same
it
is
too
because
it
is
the
question
of
transmission
invisibility
distance
which
astonishes
you
what
astonishes
me
more
than
that
is
to
hear
of
the
rosicrucians
actively
satanizing
i
confess
that
i
had
never
considered
them
as
anything
more
than
harmless
suckers
and
funereal
fakes
but
all
societies
are
composed
of
suckers
and
the
wily
leaders
who
exploit
them
that
the
case
of
the
rosicrucians
yes
their
leaders
privately
attempt
crime
one
does
not
need
to
be
erudite
or
intelligent
to
practise
the
ritual
of
spells
at
any
rate
and
i
affirm
this
there
is
among
them
a
former
man
of
letters
whom
i
know
he
lives
with
a
married
woman
and
they
pass
the
time
he
and
she
trying
to
kill
the
husband
by
sorcery
well
it
has
its
advantages
over
divorce
that
system
has
she
pouted
i
sha
say
another
word
i
think
you
are
making
fun
of
me
you
do
believe
in
anything
indeed
i
was
not
laughing
at
you
i
have
very
precise
ideas
on
this
subject
i
admit
that
at
first
blush
all
this
seems
improbable
to
say
the
least
but
when
i
think
that
all
the
efforts
of
modern
science
do
but
confirm
the
discoveries
of
the
magic
of
other
days
i
keep
my
mouth
shut
it
is
true
he
went
on
after
a
silence
to
cite
only
one
fact
that
people
can
no
longer
laugh
at
the
stories
of
women
being
changed
into
cats
in
the
middle
ages
recently
there
was
brought
to
charcot
a
little
girl
who
suddenly
got
down
on
her
hands
and
knees
and
ran
and
jumped
around
scratching
and
spitting
and
arching
her
back
so
that
metamorphosis
is
possible
no
one
can
not
too
often
repeat
it
the
truth
is
that
we
know
nothing
and
have
no
right
to
deny
anything
but
to
return
to
your
rosicrucians
using
purely
chemical
formulæ
they
get
along
without
sacrilege
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
their
venefices
supposing
they
know
how
to
prepare
them
well
enough
to
accomplish
their
purpose
though
i
doubt
that
are
easy
to
defeat
yet
i
do
mean
to
say
that
this
group
one
member
of
which
is
an
ordained
priest
does
not
make
use
of
contaminated
eucharists
at
need
another
nice
priest
but
since
you
are
so
well
informed
do
you
know
how
spells
are
conjured
away
yes
and
no
i
know
that
when
the
poisons
are
sealed
by
sacrilege
when
the
operation
is
performed
by
a
master
docre
or
one
of
the
princes
of
magic
at
rome
it
is
not
at
all
easy
nor
healthy
to
attempt
to
apply
an
antidote
though
i
have
heard
of
a
certain
abbé
at
lyons
who
practically
alone
is
succeeding
right
now
in
these
difficult
cures
dr
johannès
you
know
him
no
but
gévingey
who
has
gone
to
seek
his
medical
aid
has
told
me
of
him
well
i
do
know
how
he
goes
about
it
but
i
know
that
spells
which
are
not
complicated
with
sacrilege
are
usually
evaded
by
the
law
of
return
the
blow
is
sent
back
to
him
who
struck
it
there
are
at
the
present
time
two
churches
one
in
belgium
the
other
in
france
where
when
one
prays
before
a
statue
of
the
virgin
the
spell
which
has
been
cast
on
one
flies
off
and
goes
and
strikes
one
adversary
rats
one
of
these
churches
is
at
tougres
eighteen
kilometres
from
liége
and
the
name
of
it
is
notre
dame
de
retour
the
other
is
the
church
of
thorn
a
little
village
near
châlons
this
church
was
built
long
ago
to
conjure
away
the
spells
produced
with
the
aid
of
the
thorns
which
grew
in
that
country
and
served
to
pierce
images
cut
in
the
shape
of
hearts
near
châlons
said
durtal
digging
in
his
memory
it
does
seem
to
me
now
that
des
hermies
speaking
of
bewitchment
by
the
blood
of
white
mice
pointed
out
that
village
as
the
habitation
of
certain
diabolic
circles
yes
that
country
in
all
times
has
been
a
hotbed
of
satanism
you
are
mighty
well
up
on
these
matters
is
it
docre
who
transmitted
this
knowledge
to
you
yes
i
owe
him
the
little
i
am
able
to
pass
on
to
you
he
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
even
wanted
to
make
me
his
pupil
i
refused
and
am
glad
now
i
did
for
i
am
much
more
wary
than
i
was
then
of
being
constantly
in
a
state
of
mortal
sin
have
you
ever
attended
the
black
mass
yes
and
i
warn
you
in
advance
that
you
will
regret
having
seen
such
terrible
things
it
is
a
memory
that
persists
and
horrifies
even
especially
when
one
does
not
personally
take
part
in
the
offices
he
looked
at
her
she
was
pale
and
her
filmed
eyes
blinked
rapidly
it
your
own
wish
she
continued
you
will
have
no
complaint
if
the
spectacle
terrifies
you
or
wrings
your
heart
he
was
almost
dumbfounded
to
see
how
sad
she
was
and
with
what
difficulty
she
spoke
really
this
docre
where
did
he
come
from
what
did
he
do
formerly
how
did
he
happen
to
become
a
master
satanist
i
do
know
very
much
about
him
i
know
he
was
a
supply
priest
in
paris
then
confessor
of
a
queen
in
exile
there
were
terrible
stories
about
him
which
thanks
to
his
influential
patronage
were
hushed
up
under
the
empire
he
was
interned
at
la
trappe
then
driven
out
of
the
priesthood
excommunicated
by
rome
i
learned
in
addition
that
he
had
several
times
been
accused
of
poisoning
but
had
always
been
acquitted
because
the
tribunals
had
never
been
able
to
get
any
evidence
today
he
lives
i
do
know
how
but
at
ease
and
he
travels
a
good
deal
with
a
woman
who
serves
as
voyant
to
all
the
world
he
is
a
scoundrel
but
he
is
learned
and
perverse
and
then
he
is
so
charming
oh
he
said
how
changed
your
eyes
and
voice
are
admit
that
you
are
in
love
with
him
no
not
now
but
why
should
i
not
tell
you
that
we
were
mad
about
each
other
at
one
time
and
now
it
is
over
i
swear
it
is
we
have
remained
friends
and
nothing
more
but
then
you
often
went
to
see
him
what
kind
of
a
place
did
he
have
at
least
it
was
curious
and
heterodoxically
arranged
no
it
was
quite
ordinary
but
very
comfortable
and
clean
he
had
a
chemical
laboratory
and
an
immense
library
the
only
curious
book
he
showed
me
was
an
office
of
the
black
mass
on
parchment
there
were
admirable
illuminations
and
the
binding
was
made
of
the
tanned
skin
of
a
child
who
had
died
unbaptized
stamped
into
the
cover
in
the
shape
of
a
fleuron
was
a
great
host
consecrated
in
a
black
mass
what
did
the
manuscript
say
i
did
not
read
it
they
were
silent
then
she
took
his
hands
now
you
are
yourself
again
i
knew
i
should
cure
you
of
your
bad
humour
admit
that
i
am
awfully
not
to
have
got
angry
at
you
got
angry
what
about
because
it
is
not
very
flattering
to
a
woman
to
be
able
to
entertain
a
man
only
by
telling
him
about
another
one
oh
no
it
is
that
way
at
all
he
said
kissing
her
eyes
tenderly
let
me
go
now
she
said
very
low
this
enervates
me
and
i
must
get
home
it
late
she
sighed
and
fled
leaving
him
amazed
and
wondering
in
what
weird
activities
the
life
of
that
woman
had
been
passed
chapter
xviii
the
day
after
that
on
which
he
had
spewed
such
furious
vituperation
over
the
tribunal
gilles
de
rais
appeared
again
before
his
judges
he
presented
himself
with
bowed
head
and
clasped
hands
he
had
once
more
jumped
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
a
few
hours
had
sufficed
to
break
the
spirit
of
the
energumen
who
now
declared
that
he
recognized
the
authority
of
the
magistrates
and
begged
forgiveness
for
having
insulted
them
they
affirmed
that
for
the
love
of
our
lord
they
forgot
his
imprecations
and
at
his
prayer
the
bishop
and
the
inquisitor
revoked
the
sentence
of
excommunication
which
they
had
passed
on
him
the
day
before
this
hearing
was
in
addition
taken
up
with
the
arraignment
of
prelati
and
his
accomplices
then
authorized
by
the
ecclesiastical
text
which
says
that
a
confession
can
not
be
regarded
as
sufficient
if
it
is
dubia
vaga
generalis
illativa
jocosa
the
prosecutor
asserted
that
to
certify
the
sincerity
of
his
confessions
gilles
must
be
subjected
to
the
canonic
question
that
is
to
torture
the
marshal
besought
the
bishop
to
wait
until
the
next
day
and
claiming
the
right
of
confessing
immediately
to
such
judges
as
the
tribunal
were
pleased
to
designate
he
swore
that
he
would
thereafter
repeat
his
confession
before
the
public
and
the
court
jean
de
malestroit
granted
this
request
and
the
bishop
of
saint
brieuc
and
pierre
de
were
appointed
to
hear
gilles
in
his
cell
when
he
had
finished
the
recital
of
his
debauches
and
murders
they
ordered
prelati
to
be
brought
to
them
at
sight
of
him
gilles
burst
into
tears
and
when
after
the
interrogatory
preparations
were
made
to
conduct
the
italian
back
to
his
dungeon
gilles
embraced
him
saying
farewell
francis
my
friend
we
shall
never
see
each
other
again
in
this
world
i
pray
god
to
give
you
good
patience
and
i
hope
in
him
that
we
may
meet
again
in
great
joy
in
paradise
pray
god
for
me
and
i
shall
pray
for
you
and
gilles
was
left
alone
to
meditate
on
his
crimes
which
he
was
to
confess
publicly
at
the
hearing
next
day
that
day
was
the
impressive
day
of
the
trial
the
room
in
which
the
tribunal
sat
was
crammed
and
there
were
multitudes
sitting
on
the
stairs
standing
in
the
corridors
filling
the
neighbouring
courts
blocking
the
streets
and
lanes
from
twenty
miles
around
the
peasants
were
come
to
see
the
memorable
beast
whose
very
name
before
his
capture
had
served
to
close
the
doors
those
evenings
when
in
universal
trembling
the
women
dared
not
weep
aloud
this
meeting
of
the
tribunal
was
to
be
conducted
with
the
most
minute
observance
of
all
the
forms
all
the
assize
judges
who
in
a
long
hearing
generally
had
their
places
filled
by
proxies
were
present
the
courtroom
massive
obscure
upheld
by
heavy
roman
pillars
had
been
rejuvenated
the
wall
ogival
threw
to
cathedral
height
the
arches
of
its
vaulted
ceiling
which
were
joined
together
like
the
sides
of
an
abbatial
mitre
in
a
point
the
room
was
lighted
by
sickly
daylight
which
was
filtered
through
small
panes
between
heavy
leads
the
azure
of
the
ceiling
was
darkened
to
navy
blue
and
the
golden
stars
at
that
height
were
as
the
heads
of
steel
pins
in
the
shadows
of
the
vaults
appeared
the
ermine
of
the
ducal
arms
dimly
seen
in
escutcheons
which
were
like
great
dice
with
black
dots
suddenly
the
trumpets
blared
the
room
was
lighted
up
and
the
bishops
entered
their
mitres
of
cloth
of
gold
flamed
like
the
lightning
about
their
necks
were
brilliant
collars
with
orphreys
crusted
as
were
the
robes
with
carbuncles
in
silent
processional
the
bishops
advanced
weighted
down
by
their
rigid
copes
which
fell
in
a
flare
from
their
shoulders
and
were
like
golden
bells
split
in
the
back
in
their
hands
they
carried
the
crozier
from
which
hung
the
maniple
a
sort
of
green
veil
at
each
step
they
glowed
like
coals
blown
upon
themselves
were
sufficient
to
light
the
room
as
they
reanimated
with
their
jewels
the
pale
sun
of
a
rainy
october
day
and
scattered
a
new
lustre
to
all
parts
of
the
room
over
the
mute
audience
outshone
by
the
shimmer
of
the
orphreys
and
the
stones
the
costumes
of
the
other
judges
appeared
darker
and
discordant
the
black
vestments
of
secular
justice
the
white
and
black
robe
of
jean
blouyn
the
silk
symars
the
red
woollen
mantles
the
scarlet
chaperons
lined
with
fur
seemed
faded
and
common
the
bishops
seated
themselves
in
the
front
row
surrounding
jean
de
malestroit
who
from
a
raised
seat
dominated
the
court
under
the
escort
of
the
gilles
entered
he
was
broken
and
haggard
and
had
aged
twenty
years
in
one
night
his
eyes
burned
behind
seared
lids
his
cheeks
shook
upon
injunction
he
began
the
recital
of
his
crimes
in
a
laboured
voice
choked
by
tears
he
recounted
his
abductions
of
children
his
hideous
tactics
his
infernal
stimulations
his
impetuous
murders
his
implacable
violations
obsessed
by
the
vision
of
his
victims
he
described
their
agonies
drawn
out
or
hastened
their
cries
the
rattle
in
their
throats
he
confessed
to
having
wallowed
in
the
elastic
warmth
of
their
intestines
he
confessed
that
he
had
ripped
out
their
hearts
through
wounds
enlarged
and
opening
like
ripe
fruit
and
with
the
eyes
of
a
somnambulist
he
looked
down
at
his
fingers
and
shook
them
as
if
blood
were
dripping
from
them
the
audience
kept
a
mournful
silence
which
was
lacerated
suddenly
by
a
few
short
cries
and
the
attendants
at
a
run
carried
out
fainting
women
mad
with
horror
he
seemed
to
see
nothing
to
hear
nothing
he
continued
to
tell
off
the
frightful
rosary
of
his
crimes
then
his
voice
became
raucous
he
was
coming
to
the
sepulchral
violations
and
now
to
the
torture
of
the
little
children
whom
he
had
cajoled
in
order
to
cut
their
throats
as
he
kissed
them
he
divulged
every
detail
the
account
was
so
formidable
so
atrocious
that
beneath
their
golden
caps
the
bishops
blanched
these
priests
tempered
in
the
fires
of
confessional
these
judges
who
in
that
time
of
demonomania
and
murder
had
never
heard
more
terrifying
confessions
these
prelates
whom
no
depravity
had
ever
astonished
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
jean
de
malestroit
rose
and
for
very
shame
veiled
the
face
of
the
christ
then
all
lowered
their
heads
and
without
a
word
they
listened
the
marshal
bathed
in
sweat
his
face
downcast
looked
now
at
the
crucifix
whose
invisible
head
and
bristling
crown
of
thorns
gave
their
shapes
to
the
veil
he
finished
his
narrative
and
broke
down
completely
till
now
he
had
stood
erect
speaking
as
if
in
a
daze
recounting
to
himself
aloud
the
memory
of
his
ineradicable
crimes
but
at
the
end
of
the
story
his
forces
abandoned
him
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
shaken
by
terrific
sobs
he
cried
o
god
o
my
redeemer
i
beseech
mercy
and
pardon
then
the
ferocious
and
haughty
baron
the
first
of
his
caste
no
doubt
humiliated
himself
he
turned
toward
the
people
and
said
weeping
ye
the
parents
of
those
whom
i
have
so
cruelly
put
to
death
give
ah
give
me
the
succour
of
your
pious
prayers
then
in
its
white
splendour
the
soul
of
the
middle
ages
burst
forth
radiant
jean
de
malestroit
left
his
seat
and
raised
the
accused
who
was
beating
the
flagstones
with
his
despairing
forehead
the
judge
in
de
malestroit
disappeared
the
priest
alone
remained
he
embraced
the
sinner
who
was
repenting
and
lamenting
his
fault
a
shudder
overran
the
audience
when
jean
de
malestroit
with
head
on
his
breast
said
to
him
pray
that
the
just
and
rightful
wrath
of
the
most
high
be
averted
weep
that
your
tears
may
wash
out
the
blood
lust
from
your
being
and
with
one
accord
everybody
in
the
room
knelt
down
and
prayed
for
the
assassin
when
the
orisons
were
hushed
there
was
an
instant
of
wild
terror
and
commotion
driven
beyond
human
limits
of
horror
and
pity
the
crowd
tossed
and
surged
the
judges
of
the
tribunal
silent
enervated
reconquered
themselves
with
a
gesture
brushing
away
his
tears
the
prosecutor
arrested
the
proceedings
he
said
that
the
crimes
were
clear
and
apparent
that
the
proofs
were
manifest
that
the
court
would
now
in
its
conscience
and
soul
chastise
the
culprit
and
he
demanded
that
the
day
of
passing
judgment
be
fixed
the
tribunal
designated
the
day
after
the
next
and
that
day
the
official
of
the
church
of
nantes
jacques
de
pentcoetdic
read
in
succession
the
two
sentences
the
first
passed
by
the
bishop
and
the
inquisitor
for
the
acts
coming
under
their
common
jurisdiction
began
thus
the
holy
name
of
christ
invoked
we
jean
bishop
of
nantes
and
brother
jean
blouyn
bachelor
in
our
holy
scriptures
of
the
order
of
the
preaching
friars
of
nantes
and
delegate
of
the
inquisitor
of
heresies
for
the
city
and
diocese
of
nantes
in
session
of
the
tribunal
and
having
before
our
eyes
god
alone
and
after
enumerating
the
crimes
it
concluded
we
pronounce
decide
and
declare
that
thou
gilles
de
rais
cited
unto
our
tribunal
art
heinously
guilty
of
heresy
apostasy
and
evocation
of
demons
that
for
these
crimes
thou
hast
incurred
the
sentence
of
excommunication
and
all
other
penalties
determined
by
the
law
the
second
judgment
rendered
by
the
bishop
alone
on
the
crimes
of
sodomy
sacrilege
and
violation
of
the
immunities
of
the
church
which
more
particularly
concerned
his
authority
ended
in
the
same
conclusions
and
in
the
pronunciation
in
almost
identical
form
of
the
same
penalty
gilles
listened
with
bowed
head
to
the
reading
of
these
judgments
when
it
was
over
the
bishop
and
the
inquisitor
said
to
him
will
you
now
that
you
detest
your
errors
your
evocations
and
your
crimes
be
reincorporated
into
the
church
our
mother
and
upon
the
ardent
prayers
of
the
marshal
they
relieved
him
of
all
excommunication
and
admitted
him
to
participate
in
the
sacraments
the
justice
of
god
was
satisfied
the
crime
was
recognized
punished
but
effaced
by
contrition
and
penitence
only
human
justice
remained
the
bishop
and
the
inquisitor
remanded
the
culprit
to
the
secular
court
which
holding
against
him
the
abductions
and
the
murders
pronounced
the
penalty
of
death
and
attainder
prelati
and
the
other
accomplices
were
at
the
same
time
condemned
to
be
hanged
and
burned
alive
cry
to
god
mercy
said
pierre
de
who
presided
over
the
civil
hearings
and
dispose
yourself
to
die
in
good
state
with
a
great
repentance
for
having
committed
such
crimes
the
recommendation
was
unnecessary
gilles
now
faced
death
without
fear
he
hoped
humbly
avidly
in
the
mercy
of
the
saviour
he
cried
out
fervently
for
the
terrestrial
expiation
the
stake
to
redeem
him
from
the
eternal
flames
after
his
death
far
from
his
châteaux
in
his
dungeon
alone
he
had
opened
himself
and
viewed
the
cloaca
which
had
so
long
been
fed
by
the
residual
waters
escaped
from
the
abattoirs
of
tiffauges
and
mâchecoul
he
had
sobbed
in
despair
of
ever
draining
this
stagnant
pool
and
by
grace
in
a
cry
of
horror
and
joy
he
had
suddenly
seen
his
soul
overflow
and
sweep
away
the
dank
fen
before
a
torrential
current
of
prayer
and
ecstasy
the
butcher
of
sodom
had
destroyed
himself
the
companion
of
jeanne
had
reappeared
the
mystic
whose
soul
poured
out
to
god
in
bursts
of
adoration
in
floods
of
tears
then
he
thought
of
his
friends
and
wished
that
they
also
might
die
in
a
state
of
grace
he
asked
the
bishop
of
nantes
that
they
might
be
executed
not
before
nor
after
him
but
at
the
same
time
he
carried
his
point
that
he
was
the
most
guilty
and
that
he
must
instruct
them
in
saving
their
souls
and
assist
them
at
the
moment
when
they
should
mount
the
scaffold
jean
de
malestroit
granted
the
supplication
what
is
curious
said
durtal
interrupting
his
writing
to
light
a
cigarette
is
that
a
gentle
ring
mme
chantelouve
entered
she
declared
that
she
could
stay
only
two
minutes
she
had
a
carriage
waiting
below
tonight
she
said
i
will
call
for
you
at
nine
first
write
me
a
letter
in
practically
these
terms
and
she
handed
him
a
paper
he
unfolded
it
and
read
this
declaration
i
certify
that
all
that
i
have
said
and
written
about
the
black
mass
about
the
priest
who
celebrated
it
about
the
place
where
i
claimed
to
have
witnessed
it
about
the
persons
alleged
to
have
been
there
is
pure
invention
i
affirm
that
i
imagined
all
these
incidents
that
in
consequence
all
that
i
have
narrated
is
false
docre
he
asked
studying
the
handwriting
minute
pointed
twisted
aggressive
yes
and
he
wants
this
declaration
not
dated
to
be
made
in
the
form
of
a
letter
from
you
to
a
person
consulting
you
on
the
subject
your
canon
distrusts
me
of
course
you
write
books
it
does
please
me
infinitely
to
sign
that
murmured
durtal
what
if
i
refuse
you
will
not
go
to
the
black
mass
his
curiosity
overcame
his
reluctance
he
wrote
and
signed
the
letter
and
mme
chantelouve
put
it
in
her
and
in
what
street
is
the
ceremony
to
take
place
in
the
rue
olivier
de
serres
where
is
that
near
the
rue
de
vaugirard
away
up
is
that
where
docre
lives
no
we
are
going
to
a
private
house
which
belongs
to
a
lady
he
knows
now
if
you
be
so
good
put
off
your
to
some
other
time
because
i
am
in
an
awful
hurry
at
nine
do
forget
be
all
ready
he
had
hardly
time
to
kiss
her
and
she
was
gone
well
said
he
i
already
had
data
on
incubacy
and
poisoning
by
spells
there
remained
only
the
black
mass
to
make
me
thoroughly
acquainted
with
satanism
as
it
is
practised
in
our
day
and
i
am
to
see
it
i
be
damned
if
i
thought
there
were
such
undercurrents
in
paris
and
how
circumstances
hang
together
and
lead
to
each
other
i
had
to
occupy
myself
with
gilles
de
rais
and
the
diabolism
of
the
middle
ages
to
get
contemporary
diabolism
revealed
to
me
and
he
thought
of
docre
again
what
a
sharper
that
priest
is
among
the
occultists
who
maunder
today
in
the
universal
decomposition
of
ideas
he
is
the
only
one
who
interests
me
the
others
the
mages
the
theosophists
the
cabalists
the
spiritists
the
hermetics
the
rosicrucians
remind
me
when
they
are
not
mere
thieves
of
children
playing
and
scuffling
in
a
cellar
and
if
one
descend
lower
yet
into
the
places
of
the
pythonesses
clairvoyants
and
mediums
what
does
one
find
except
agencies
of
prostitution
and
gambling
all
these
pretended
peddlers
of
the
future
are
extremely
nasty
that
the
only
thing
in
the
occult
of
which
one
can
be
sure
des
hermies
interrupted
the
course
of
these
reflections
by
ringing
and
walking
in
he
came
to
announce
that
gévingey
had
returned
and
that
they
were
all
to
dine
at
carhaix
the
night
after
next
is
carhaix
bronchitis
cured
yes
completely
preoccupied
with
the
idea
of
the
black
mass
durtal
could
not
keep
silent
he
let
out
the
fact
that
he
was
to
witness
the
ceremony
and
confronted
by
des
hermies
stare
of
stupefaction
he
added
that
he
had
promised
secrecy
and
that
he
could
not
for
the
present
tell
him
more
you
the
lucky
one
said
des
hermies
is
it
too
much
to
ask
you
the
name
of
the
abbé
who
is
to
officiate
not
at
all
canon
docre
ah
and
the
other
was
silent
he
was
evidently
trying
to
divine
by
what
manipulations
his
friend
had
been
able
to
get
in
touch
with
the
renegade
some
time
ago
you
told
me
durtal
said
that
in
the
middle
ages
the
black
mass
was
said
on
the
naked
buttocks
of
a
woman
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
celebrated
on
the
abdomen
and
now
i
believe
that
it
takes
place
before
an
altar
as
in
church
indeed
it
was
sometimes
celebrated
thus
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
in
biscay
it
is
true
that
the
devil
then
officiated
in
person
clothed
in
rent
and
soiled
episcopal
habits
he
gave
communion
with
round
pieces
of
shoe
leather
for
hosts
saying
is
my
body
and
he
gave
these
disgusting
wafers
to
the
faithful
to
eat
after
they
had
kissed
his
left
hand
and
his
breech
i
hope
that
you
will
not
be
obliged
to
render
such
base
homage
to
your
canon
durtal
laughed
no
i
do
think
he
requires
a
pretend
like
that
but
look
here
are
you
of
the
decided
opinion
that
the
creatures
who
so
piously
infamously
follow
these
offices
are
a
bit
mad
mad
why
the
cult
of
the
demon
is
no
more
insane
than
that
of
god
one
is
rotten
and
the
other
resplendent
that
is
all
by
your
reckoning
all
people
who
worship
any
god
whatever
would
be
demented
no
the
affiliates
of
satanism
are
mystics
of
a
vile
order
but
they
are
mystics
now
it
is
highly
probable
that
their
exaltations
into
the
of
evil
coincide
with
the
rages
of
their
frenzied
senses
for
lechery
is
the
wet
nurse
of
demonism
medicine
classes
rightly
or
wrongly
the
hunger
for
ordure
in
the
unknown
categories
of
neurosis
and
well
it
may
for
nobody
knows
anything
about
neuroses
except
that
everybody
has
them
it
is
quite
certain
that
in
this
more
than
in
any
previous
century
the
nerves
quiver
at
the
least
shock
for
instance
recall
the
newspaper
accounts
of
executions
of
criminals
we
learn
that
the
executioner
goes
about
his
work
timidly
that
he
is
on
the
point
of
fainting
that
he
has
nervous
prostration
when
he
decapitates
a
man
then
compare
this
nervous
wreck
with
the
invincible
torturers
of
the
olden
time
they
would
thrust
your
arm
into
a
sleeve
of
moistened
parchment
which
when
set
on
fire
would
draw
up
and
in
a
leisurely
fashion
reduce
your
flesh
to
dust
or
they
would
drive
wedges
into
your
thighs
and
split
the
bones
they
would
crush
your
thumbs
in
the
thumbscrew
or
they
would
singe
all
the
hair
off
your
epidermis
with
a
poker
or
roll
up
the
skin
from
your
abdomen
and
leave
you
with
a
kind
of
apron
they
would
drag
you
at
the
cart
tail
give
you
the
strappado
roast
you
drench
you
with
ignited
alcohol
and
through
it
all
preserve
an
impassive
countenance
and
tranquil
nerves
not
to
be
shaken
by
any
cry
or
plaint
only
as
these
exercises
were
somewhat
fatiguing
the
torturers
after
the
operation
were
ravenously
hungry
and
required
a
deal
of
drink
they
were
sanguinaries
of
a
mental
stability
not
to
be
shaken
while
now
but
to
return
to
your
companions
in
sacrilege
this
evening
if
they
are
not
maniacs
you
will
find
them
doubt
it
not
repulsive
lechers
observe
them
closely
i
am
sure
that
to
them
the
invocation
of
beelzebub
is
a
prelibation
of
carnality
do
be
afraid
because
lord
in
this
group
there
wo
be
any
to
make
you
imitate
the
martyr
of
whom
jacques
de
voragine
speaks
in
his
history
of
saint
paul
the
eremite
you
know
that
legend
no
well
to
refresh
your
soul
i
will
tell
you
this
martyr
who
was
very
young
was
stretched
out
his
hands
and
feet
bound
on
a
bed
then
a
superb
specimen
of
femininity
was
brought
in
who
tried
to
force
him
as
he
was
burning
and
was
about
to
sin
he
bit
off
his
tongue
and
spat
it
in
the
face
of
the
woman
and
thus
pain
drove
out
temptation
says
the
good
de
voragine
my
heroism
would
not
carry
me
so
far
as
that
i
confess
but
must
you
go
so
soon
yes
i
have
a
pressing
engagement
what
a
queer
age
said
durtal
conducting
him
to
the
door
it
is
just
at
the
moment
when
positivism
is
at
its
zenith
that
mysticism
rises
again
and
the
follies
of
the
occult
begin
oh
but
it
always
been
that
way
the
tail
ends
of
all
centuries
are
alike
they
always
periods
of
vacillation
and
uncertainty
when
materialism
is
magic
takes
root
this
phenomenon
reappears
every
hundred
years
not
to
go
further
back
look
at
the
decline
of
the
last
century
alongside
of
the
rationalists
and
atheists
you
find
cagliostro

cazotte
the
rosicrucian
societies
the
infernal
circles
as
now
with
that
and
good
luck
yes
said
durtal
closing
the
door
but
cagliostro
and
his
ilk
had
a
certain
audacity
and
perhaps
a
little
knowledge
while
the

inept

in

they
went
up
the
rue

as
in
a

and
spoke
not

durtal
looked
closely
at
her
when
as
they
passed
a
street
lamp
a
shaft
of
light
played
over
her
veil
a
moment
then
winked
out
she
seemed
agitated
and
nervous
beneath
her
reserve
he
took
her
hand
she
did
not
withdraw
it
he
could
feel
the
chill
of
it
through
her
glove
and
her
blonde
hair
tonight
seemed
disordered
dry
and
not
so
fine
as
usual
nearly
there
but
in
a
low
voice
full
of
anguish
she
said
do
not
speak
bored
by
this
taciturn
almost
hostile
he
began
to
examine
the
route
through
the
windows
of
the
cab
the
street
stretched
out
interminable
already
deserted
so
badly
paved
that
at
every
step
the
cab
springs
creaked
the
were
beginning
to
be
further
and
further
apart
the

was
approaching

singular

he
murmured

by

inscrutable
reserve
abruptly
the
vehicle
turned
up
a
dark
street
swung
around
and
stopped

got
out
waiting
for
the
cabman
to
give
him
his
change
durtal
inspected
the
lay
of
the
land
they
were
in
a
sort
of
blind
alley
low
houses
in
which
there
was
not
a
sign
of
life
bordered
a
lane
that
had
no
sidewalk
the
pavement
was
like
billows
turning
around
when
the
cab
drove
away
he
found
himself
confronted
by
a
long
high
wall
above
which
dry
leaves
rustled
in
the
shadows
a
little
door
with
a
square
grating
in
it
was
cut
into
the
thick
unlighted
wall
which
was
seamed
with
fissures
suddenly
further
away
a
ray
of
light
shot
out
of
a
show
window
and
doubtless
attracted
by
the
sound
of
the
cab
wheels
a
man
wearing
the
black
apron
of
a
wineshop
keeper
lounged
through
the
shop
door
and
spat
on
the
threshold
this
is
the
place
said
mme

she
rang
the
grating
opened
she
raised
her
veil
a
shaft
of
lantern
light
struck
her
full
in
the

the
door
opened
noiselessly
and
they
penetrated
into
a
garden
good
evening
madame
good
evening
marie
in
the
chapel
yes
does
madame
wish
me
to
guide
her
no
thanks
the
woman
with
the
lantern
scrutinized
durtal
he
perceived
beneath
a
hood
wisps
of
grey
hair
falling
in
disorder
over
a
wrinkled
old
face
but
she
did
not
give
him
time
to
examine
her
and
returned
to
a
tent
beside
the
wall
serving
her
as
a
lodge
he
followed
hyacinthe
who
traversed
the
dark
lanes
between
rows
of
palms
to
the
entrance
of
a
building
she
opened
the
doors
as
if
she
were
quite
at
home
and
her
heels
clicked
resolutely
on
the
flagstones
be
careful
she
said
going
through
a
vestibule
there
are
three
steps
they
came
out
into
a
court
and
stopped
before
an
old
house
she
rang
a
little
man
advanced
hiding
his
features
and
greeted
her
in
an
affected
voice
she
passed
saluting
him
and
durtal
brushed
a
face
the
eyes
liquid
gummy
the
cheeks
plastered
with
cosmetics
the
lips
painted
i
have
stumbled
into
a
lair
of
you
did
tell
me
that
i
was
to
be
thrown
into
such
company
he
said
to
hyacinthe
overtaking
her
at
the
turning
of
a
corridor
lighted
by
a
lamp
did
you
expect
to
meet
saints
here
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
opened
a
door
they
were
in
a
chapel
with
a
low
ceiling
crossed
by
beams
gaudily
painted
with
pigment
the
windows
were
hidden
by
great
curtains
the
walls
were
cracked
and
dingy
durtal
recoiled
after
a
few
steps
gusts
of
humid
mouldy
air
and
of
that
indescribable
acridity
poured
out
of
the
registers
to
mingle
with
an
irritating
odour
of
alkali
resin
and
burnt
herbs
he
was
choking
his
temples
throbbing
he
advanced
groping
attempting
to
accustom
his
eyes
to
the
the
chapel
was
vaguely
lighted
by
sanctuary
lamps
suspended
from
chandeliers
of
gilded
bronze
with
pink
glass
pendants
hyacinthe
made
him
a
sign
to
sit
down
then
she
went
over
to
a
group
of
people
sitting
on
divans
in
a
dark
corner
rather
vexed
at
being
left
here
away
from
the
centre
of
activity
durtal
noticed
that
there
were
many
women
and
few
men
present
but
his
efforts
to
discover
their
features
were
unavailing
as
here
and
there
a
lamp
swayed
he
occasionally
caught
sight
of
a
junonian
brunette
then
of
a
melancholy
man
he
observed
that
the
women
were
not
chattering
to
each
other
their
conversation
seemed
awed
and
grave
not
a
laugh
not
a
raised
voice
was
heard
but
an
irresolute
furtive
whispering
unaccompanied
by
gesture
hmm
he
said
to
himself
it
does
look
as
if
satan
made
his
faithful
happy
a
choir
boy
clad
in
red
advanced
to
the
end
of
the
chapel
and
lighted
a
stand
of
candles
then
the
altar
became
visible
it
was
an
ordinary
church
altar
on
a
tabernacle
above
which
stood
an
infamous
derisive
christ
the
head
had
been
raised
and
the
neck
lengthened
and
wrinkles
painted
in
the
cheeks
transformed
the
grieving
face
to
a
bestial
one
twisted
into
a
mean
laugh
he
was
naked
and
where
the
loincloth
should
have
been
there
was
a
virile
member
projecting
from
a
bush
of
horsehair
in
front
of
the
tabernacle
the
chalice
covered
with
a
pall
was
placed
the
choir
boy
folded
the
altar
cloth
wiggled
his
haunches
stood
tiptoe
on
one
foot
and
flipped
his
arms
as
if
to
fly
away
like
a
cherub
on
pretext
of
reaching
up
to
light
the
black
tapers
whose
odour
of
coal
tar
and
pitch
was
now
added
to
the
pestilential
smell
of
the
stuffy
room
durtal
recognized
beneath
the
red
robe
the
fairy
who
had
guarded
the
chapel
entrance
and
he
understood
the
rôle
reserved
for
this
man
whose
sacrilegious
nastiness
was
substituted
for
the
purity
of
childhood
acceptable
to
the
church
then
another
choir
boy
more
hideous
yet
exhibited
himself
hollow
chested
racked
by
coughs
withered
made
up
with
white
grease
paint
and
vivid
carmine
he
hobbled
about
humming
he
approached
the
tripods
flanking
the
altar
stirred
the
smouldering
incense
pots
and
threw
in
leaves
and
chunks
of
resin
durtal
was
beginning
to
feel
uncomfortable
when
hyacinthe
rejoined
him
she
excused
herself
for
having
left
him
by
himself
so
long
invited
him
to
change
his
place
and
conducted
him
to
a
seat
far
in
the
rear
behind
all
the
rows
of
chairs
this
is
a
real
chapel
is
it
he
asked
yes
this
house
this
church
the
garden
that
we
crossed
are
the
remains
of
an
old
ursuline
convent
for
a
long
time
this
chapel
was
used
to
store
hay
the
house
belonged
to
a
keeper
who
sold
it
to
that
woman
and
she
pointed
out
a
stout
brunette
of
whom
durtal
before
had
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
is
she
married
no
she
is
a
former
nun
who
was
debauched
long
ago
by
docre
ah
and
those
gentlemen
who
seem
to
be
hiding
in
the
darkest
places
they
are
satanists
there
is
one
of
them
who
was
a
professor
in
the
school
of
medicine
in
his
home
he
has
an
oratorium
where
he
prays
to
a
statue
of
venus
astarte
mounted
on
an
altar
no
i
mean
it
he
is
getting
old
and
his
demoniac
orisons
increase
tenfold
his
forces
which
he
is
using
up
with
creatures
of
that
sort
and
with
a
gesture
she
indicated
the
choir
boys
you
guarantee
the
truth
of
this
story
you
will
find
it
narrated
at
great
length
in
a
religious
journal
annales
de
la
and
though
his
identity
was
made
pretty
patent
in
the
article
the
man
did
not
dare
prosecute
the
what
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
looking
at
him
closely
i
strangling
the
odour
from
those
incense
burners
is
unbearable
you
will
get
used
to
it
in
a
few
seconds
but
what
do
they
burn
that
smells
like
that
asphalt
from
the
street
leaves
of
henbane
datura
dried
nightshade
and
myrrh
these
are
perfumes
delightful
to
satan
our
master
she
spoke
in
that
changed
guttural
voice
which
had
been
hers
at
times
when
in
bed
with
him
he
looked
her
squarely
in
the
face
she
was
pale
the
lips
pressed
tight
the
pluvious
eyes
blinking
rapidly
here
he
comes
she
murmured
suddenly
while
women
in
front
of
them
scurried
about
or
knelt
in
front
of
the
chairs
preceded
by
the
two
choir
boys
the
canon
entered
wearing
a
scarlet
bonnet
from
which
two
buffalo
horns
of
red
cloth
protruded
durtal
examined
him
as
he
marched
toward
the
altar
he
was
tall
but
not
well
built
his
bulging
chest
being
out
of
proportion
to
the
rest
of
his
body
his
peeled
forehead
made
one
continuous
line
with
his
straight
nose
the
lips
and
cheeks
bristled
with
that
kind
of
hard
clumpy
beard
which
old
priests
have
who
have
always
shaved
themselves
the
features
were
round
and
insinuating
the
eyes
like
apple
pips
close
together
phosphorescent
as
a
whole
his
face
was
evil
and
sly
but
energetic
and
the
hard
fixed
eyes
were
not
the
furtive
shifty
orbs
that
durtal
had
imagined
the
canon
solemnly
knelt
before
the
altar
then
mounted
the
steps
and
began
to
say
mass
durtal
saw
then
that
he
had
nothing
on
beneath
his
sacrificial
habit
his
black
socks
and
his
flesh
bulging
over
the
garters
attached
high
up
on
his
legs
were
plainly
visible
the
chasuble
had
the
shape
of
an
ordinary
chasuble
but
was
of
the
dark
red
colour
of
dried
blood
and
in
the
middle
in
a
triangle
around
which
was
an
embroidered
border
of
colchicum
savin
sorrel
and
spurge
was
the
figure
of
a
black
presenting
his
horns
docre
made
the
genuflexions
the
inclinations
specified
by
the
ritual
the
kneeling
choir
boys
sang
the
latin
responses
in
a
crystalline
voice
which
trilled
on
the
ultimate
syllables
of
the
words
but
it
a
simple
low
mass
said
durtal
to
mme
chantelouve
she
shook
her
head
indeed
at
that
moment
the
choir
boys
passed
behind
the
altar
and
one
of
them
brought
back
copper
the
other
censers
which
they
distributed
to
the
congregation
all
the
women
enveloped
themselves
in
the
smoke
some
held
their
heads
right
over
the
and
inhaled
deeply
then
fainting
unlaced
themselves
heaving
raucous
sighs
the
sacrifice
ceased
the
priest
descended
the
steps
backward
knelt
on
the
last
one
and
in
a
sharp
tripidant
voice
cried
master
of
slanders
dispenser
of
the
benefits
of
crime
administrator
of
sumptuous
sins
and
great
vices
satan
thee
we
adore
reasonable
god
just
god
superadmirable
legate
of
false
trances
thou
receivest
our
beseeching
tears
thou
savest
the
honour
of
families
by
aborting
wombs
impregnated
in
the
forgetfulness
of
the
good
orgasm
thou
dost
suggest
to
the
mother
the
hastening
of
untimely
birth
and
thine
obstetrics
spares
the
children
the
anguish
of
maturity
the
contamination
of
original
sin
mainstay
of
the
despairing
poor
cordial
of
the
vanquished
it
is
thou
who
endowest
them
with
hypocrisy
ingratitude
and
that
they
may
defend
themselves
against
the
children
of
god
the
rich
suzerain
of
resentment
accountant
of
humiliations
treasurer
of
old
hatreds
thou
alone
dost
fertilize
the
brain
of
man
whom
injustice
has
crushed
thou
breathest
into
him
the
idea
of
meditated
vengeance
sure
misdeeds
thou
incitest
him
to
murder
thou
givest
him
the
abundant
joy
of
accomplished
reprisals
and
permittest
him
to
taste
the
intoxicating
draught
of
the
tears
of
which
he
is
the
cause
hope
of
virility
anguish
of
the
empty
womb
thou
dost
not
demand
the
bootless
offering
of
chaste
loins
thou
dost
not
sing
the
praises
of
lenten
follies
thou
alone
receivest
the
carnal
supplications
and
petitions
of
poor
and
avaricious
families
thou
determinest
the
mother
to
sell
her
daughter
to
give
her
son
thou
aidest
sterile
and
reprobate
loves
guardian
of
strident
neuroses
leaden
tower
of
hysteria
bloody
vase
of

master
thy
faithful
servants
on
their
knees
implore
thee
and
supplicate
thee
to
satisfy
them
when
they
wish
the
torture
of
all
those
who
love
them
and
aid
them
they
supplicate
thee
to
assure
them
the
joy
of
delectable
misdeeds
unknown
to
justice
spells
whose
unknown
origin
baffles
the
reason

they
ask

of
the
disinherited

docre
rose
and
erect
with

outstretched
vociferated
in
a
ringing
voice
of
hate
and
thou

heard
the
death
rattle
of
the
timid
paralyzed
by
famine
of
women
disembowelled
for
a
bit

and
thou
hast
caused
the
chancery

by
dilatory

of
thy
body
profaner

abstractor

stupid
purities
cursed
nazarene
king

god
amen
trilled
the
soprano
voices
of
the
choir
boys
durtal
listened
in
amazement
to
this
torrent
of
blasphemies
and
insults
the
foulness
of
the
priest
stupefied
him
a
silence
succeeded
the
litany
the
chapel
was
foggy
with
the
smoke
of
the
censers
the
women
hitherto
taciturn
flustered
now
as
remounting
the
altar
the
canon
turned
toward
them
and
blessed
them
with
his
left
hand
in
a
sweeping
gesture
and
suddenly
the
choir
boys
tinkled
the
prayer
bells
it
was
a
signal
the
women
fell
to
the
carpet
and
writhed
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
worked
by
a
spring
she
threw
herself
prone
and
waved
her
legs
in
the
air
another
suddenly
struck
by
a
hideous
strabism
clucked
then
becoming
stood
with
her
mouth
open
the
tongue
turned
back
the
tip
cleaving
to
the
palate
another
inflated
livid
her
pupils
dilated
lolled
her
head
back
over
her
shoulders
then
jerked
it
brusquely
erect
and
belaboured
herself
tearing
her
breast
with
her
nails
another
sprawling
on
her
back
undid
her
skirts
drew
forth
a
rag
enormous
meteorized
then
her
face
twisted
into
a
horrible
grimace
and
her
tongue
which
she
could
not
control
stuck
out
bitten
at
the
edges
harrowed
by
red
teeth
from
a
bloody
mouth
suddenly
durtal
rose
and
now
he
heard
and
saw
docre
distinctly
docre
contemplated
the
christ
surmounting
the
tabernacle
and
with
arms
spread
wide
apart
he
spewed
forth
frightful
insults
and
at
the
end
of
his
forces
muttered
the
billingsgate
of
a
drunken
cabman
one
of
the
choir
boys
knelt
before
him
with
his
back
toward
the
altar
a
shudder
ran
around
the
priest
spine
in
a
solemn
but
jerky
voice
he
said
est
enim
corpus
then
instead
of
kneeling
after
the
consecration
before
the
precious
body
he
faced
the
congregation
and
appeared
tumefied
haggard
dripping
with
sweat
he
staggered
between
the
two
choir
boys
who
raising
the
chasuble
displayed
his
naked
belly
docre
made
a
few
passes
and
the
host
sailed
tainted
and
soiled
over
the
steps
durtal
felt
himself
shudder
a
whirlwind
of
hysteria
shook
the
room
while
the
choir
boys
sprinkled
holy
water
on
the
pontiff
nakedness
women
rushed
upon
the
eucharist
and
grovelling
in
front
of
the
altar
clawed
from
the
bread
humid
particles
and
drank
and
ate
divine
ordure
another
woman
curled
up
over
a
crucifix
emitted
a
rending
laugh
then
cried
to
docre
father
father
a
crone
tore
her
hair
leapt
whirled
around
and
around
as
on
a
pivot
and
fell
over
beside
a
young
girl
who
huddled
to
the
wall
was
writhing
in
convulsions
frothing
at
the
mouth
weeping
and
spitting
out
frightful
blasphemies
and
durtal
terrified
saw
through
the
fog
the
red
horns
of
docre
who
seated
now
frothing
with
rage
was
chewing
up
sacramental
wafers
taking
them
out
of
his
mouth
wiping
himself
with
them
and
distributing
them
to
the
women
who
ground
them
underfoot
howling
or
fell
over
each
other
struggling
to
get
hold
of
them
and
violate
them
the
place
was
simply
a
madhouse
a
monstrous
pandemonium
of
prostitutes
and
maniacs
now
while
the
choir
boys
gave
themselves
to
the
men
and
while
the
woman
who
owned
the
chapel
mounted
the
altar
caught
hold
of
the
phallus
of
the
christ
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
held
a
chalice
between
his
naked
legs
a
little
girl
who
hitherto
had
not
budged
suddenly
bent
over
forward
and
howled
howled
like
a
dog
overcome
with
disgust
nearly
asphyxiated
durtal
wanted
to
flee
he
looked
for
hyacinthe
she
was
no
longer
at
his
side
he
finally
caught
sight
of
her
close
to
the
canon
and
stepping
over
the
writhing
bodies
on
the
floor
he
went
to
her
with
quivering
nostrils
she
was
inhaling
the
effluvia
of
the
perfumes
and
of
the
couples
the
sabbatic
odour
she
said
to
him
between
clenched
teeth
in
a
strangled
voice
here
let
get
out
of
this
she
seemed
to
wake
hesitated
a
moment
then
without
answering
she
followed
him
he
elbowed
his
way
through
the
crowd
jostling
women
whose
protruding
teeth
were
ready
to
bite
he
pushed
mme
chantelouve
to
the
door
crossed
the
court
traversed
the
vestibule
and
finding
the
portress
lodge
empty
he
drew
the
cord
and
found
himself
in
the
street
there
he
stopped
and
drew
the
fresh
air
deep
into
his
lungs
hyacinthe
motionless
dizzy
huddled
to
the
wall
away
from
him
he
looked
at
her
confess
that
you
would
like
to
go
in
there
again
no
she
said
with
an
effort
these
scenes
shatter
me
i
am
in
a
daze
i
must
have
a
glass
of
water
and
she
went
up
the
street
leaning
on
him
straight
to
the
wine
shop
which
was
open
it
was
an
ignoble
lair
a
little
room
with
tables
and
wooden
benches
a
zinc
counter
cheap
bar
fixtures
and
wooden
pitchers
in
the
ceiling
a
gas
bracket
two
labourers
were
playing
cards
they
turned
around
and
laughed
the
proprietor
took
the
excessively
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
spat
into
the
sawdust
he
seemed
not
at
all
surprised
to
see
this
fashionably
gowned
woman
in
his
dive
durtal
who
was
watching
him
thought
he
surprised
an
understanding
look
exchanged
by
the
proprietor
and
the
woman
the
proprietor
lighted
a
candle
and
mumbled
into
durtal
ear
monsieur
you
ca
drink
here
with
these
people
watching
i
take
you
to
a
room
where
you
can
be
alone
hmmm
said
durtal
to
hyacinthe
who
was
penetrating
the
mysteries
of
a
spiral
staircase
a
lot
of
fuss
for
a
glass
of
water
but
she
had
already
entered
a
musty
room
the
paper
was
peeling
from
the
walls
which
were
nearly
covered
with
pictures
torn
out
of
illustrated
weeklies
and
tacked
up
with
hairpins
the
floor
was
all
in
pieces
there
were
a
wooden
bed
without
any
curtains
a
chamber
pot
with
a
piece
broken
out
of
the
side
a
wash
bowl
and
two
chairs
the
man
brought
a
decanter
of
gin
a
large
one
of
water
some
sugar
and
glasses
then
went
downstairs
her
eyes
were
sombre
mad
she
enlaced
durtal
no
he
shouted
furious
at
having
fallen
into
this
trap
i
had
enough
of
that
it
late
your
husband
is
waiting
for
you
it
time
for
you
to
go
back
to
him
she
did
not
even
hear
him
i
want
you
she
said
and
she
took
him
treacherously
and
obliged
him
to
desire
her
she
disrobed
threw
her
skirts
on
the
floor
opened
wide
the
abominable
couch
and
raising
her
chemise
in
the
back
she
rubbed
her
spine
up
and
down
over
the
coarse
grain
of
the
sheets
a
look
of
swooning
ecstasy
was
in
her
eyes
and
a
smile
of
joy
on
her
lips
she
seized
him
and
with
ghoulish
fury
dragged
him
into
obscenities
of
whose
existence
he
had
never
dreamed
suddenly
when
he
was
able
to
escape
he
shuddered
for
he
perceived
that
the
bed
was
strewn
with
fragments
of
hosts
oh
you
fill
me
with
horror
dress
and
let
get
out
of
here
while
with
a
faraway
look
in
her
eyes
she
was
silently
putting
on
her
clothes
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
the
fetidness
of
the
room
nauseated
him
then
too
he
was
not
absolutely
convinced
of
transubstantiation
he
did
not
believe
very
firmly
that
the
saviour
resided
in
that
soiled
bread
but
in
spite
of
himself
the
sacrilege
he
had
involuntarily
participated
in
saddened
him
suppose
it
were
true
he
said
to
himself
that
the
presence
were
real
as
hyacinthe
and
that
miserable
priest
attest
no
decidedly
i
have
had
enough
i
am
through
the
occasion
is
timely
for
me
to
break
with
this
creature
whom
from
our
very
first
interview
i
have
only
tolerated
and
i
going
to
seize
the
opportunity
below
in
the
dive
he
had
to
face
the
knowing
smiles
of
the
labourers
he
paid
and
without
waiting
for
his
change
he
fled
they
reached
the
rue
de
vaugirard
and
he
hailed
a
cab
as
they
were
whirled
along
they
sat
lost
in
their
thoughts
not
looking
at
each
other
soon
asked
mme
chantelouve
in
an
almost
timid
tone
when
he
left
her
at
her
door
no
he
answered
we
have
nothing
in
common
you
wish
everything
and
i
wish
nothing
better
break
we
might
drag
out
our
relation
but
it
would
finally
terminate
in
recrimination
and
bitterness
oh
and
then
after
what
happened
this
evening
no
understand
me
no
and
he
gave
the
cabman
his
address
and
huddled
himself
into
the
furthest
corner
of
the
fiacre
chapter
xx
he
does
lead
a
humdrum
life
that
canon
said
des
hermies
when
durtal
had
related
to
him
the
details
of
the
black
mass
it
a
veritable
seraglio
of
and
erotomaniacs
that
he
has
formed
for
himself
but
his
vices
lack
warmth
certainly
in
the
matter
of
contumelious
blasphemies
of
sacrilegious
atrocities
and
sensual
excitation
this
priest
may
seem
to
have
exceeded
the
limits
to
be
almost
unique
but
the
bloody
and
investuous
side
of
the
old
sabbats
is
wanting
docre
is
we
must
admit
greatly
inferior
to
gilles
de
rais
his
works
are
incomplete
insipid
weak
if
i
may
say
so
i
like
that
you
know
it
is
easy
to
procure
children
whom
one
may
disembowel
with
impunity
the
parents
would
raise
a
row
and
the
police
would
interfere
yes
and
it
is
to
difficulties
of
this
sort
that
we
must
evidently
attribute
the
bloodless
celebration
of
the
black
mass
but
i
am
thinking
just
now
of
the
women
you
described
the
ones
that
put
their
heads
over
the
to
drink
in
the
smoke
of
the
burning
resin
they
employ
the
procedure
of
the
aissaouas
who
hold
their
heads
over
the
braseros
whenever
the
catalepsy
necessary
to
their
orgies
is
slow
in
coming
as
for
the
other
phenomena
you
cite
they
are
known
in
the
hospitals
and
except
as
symptoms
of
the
demoniac
effluence
they
teach
us
nothing
new
now
another
thing
not
a
word
of
this
to
carhaix
because
he
would
be
quite
capable
of
closing
his
door
in
your
face
if
he
knew
you
had
been
present
at
an
office
in
honour
of
satan
they
went
downstairs
from
durtal
apartment
and
walked
along
toward
the
tower
of
saint
sulpice
i
did
bring
anything
to
eat
because
you
said
you
would
look
after
that
said
durtal
but
this
morning
i
sent
mme
carhaix
in
lieu
of
desserts
and
wine
some
real
dutch
gingerbread
and
a
couple
of
rather
surprising
liqueurs
an
elixir
of
life
which
we
shall
take
by
way
of
appetizer
before
the
repast
and
a
flask
of
crême
de
céléri
i
have
discovered
an
honest
distiller
impossible
you
shall
see
this
elixir
of
life
is
manufactured
from
socotra
aloes
little
cardamom
saffron
myrrh
and
a
heap
of
other
aromatics
inhumanly
bitter
but
it
exquisite
i
am
anxious
to
taste
it
the
least
we
can
do
is
fête
gévingey
a
little
on
his
deliverance
have
you
seen
him
yes
he
looking
fine
we
make
him
tell
us
about
his
cure
i
keep
wondering
what
he
lives
on
on
what
his
astrological
skill
brings
him
then
there
are
rich
people
who
have
their
horoscopes
cast
we
must
hope
so
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
gévingey
is
not
in
very
easy
circumstances
under
the
empire
he
was
astrologer
to
the
empress
who
was
very
superstitious
and
had
faith
as
did
napoleon
for
that
matter
in
predictions
and
fortune
telling
but
since
the
fall
of
the
empire
i
think
gévingey
situation
has
changed
a
good
deal
for
the
worse
nevertheless
he
passes
for
being
the
only
man
in
france
who
has
preserved
the
secrets
of
cornelius
agrippa
cremona
ruggieri
gauric
sinibald
the
swordsman
and
tritemius
while
discoursing
they
had
climbed
the
stair
and
arrived
at
the
door
the
astrologer
was
already
there
and
the
table
was
set
all
grimaced
a
bit
as
they
tasted
the
black
and
active
liqueur
which
durtal
poured
joyous
to
have
all
her
family
about
her
mama
carhaix
brought
the
rich
soup
she
filled
the
plates
when
a
dish
of
vegetables
was
passed
and
durtal
chose
a
leek
des
hermies
said
laughing
look
out
porta
a
thaumaturge
of
the
late
sixteenth
century
informs
us
that
this
plant
long
considered
an
emblem
of
virility
perturbs
the
quietude
of
the
most
chaste
do
listen
to
him
said
the
wife
and
you
monsieur
gévingey
some
carrots
durtal
looked
at
the
astrologer
his
head
still
looked
like
a
his
hair
was
the
same
faded
dirty
brown
of
hydroquinine
or
ipecac
powders
his
bird
eyes
had
the
same
startled
look
his
enormous
hands
were
covered
with
the
same
phalanx
of
rings
he
had
the
same
obsequious
and
imposing
manner
and
sacerdotal
tone
but
he
was
freshened
up
considerably
the
wrinkles
had
gone
out
of
his
skin
and
his
eyes
were
brighter
since
his
visit
to
lyons
durtal
congratulated
him
on
the
happy
result
of
the
treatment
it
was
high
time
monsieur
i
was
putting
myself
under
the
care
of
johannès
for
i
was
nearly
gone
not
possessing
a
shred
of
the
gift
of
voyance
and
knowing
no
extralucid
cataleptic
who
could
inform
me
of
the
clandestine
preparations
of
canon
docre
i
could
not
possibly
defend
myself
by
using
the
laws
of
countersign
and
of
the
shock
in
return
but
said
des
hermies
admitting
that
you
could
through
the
intermediation
of
a
flying
spirit
have
been
aware
of
the
operations
of
the
priest
how
could
you
have
parried
them
the
law
of
countersigns
consists
when
you
know
in
advance
the
day
and
hour
of
the
attack
in
going
away
from
home
thus
throwing
the
spell
off
the
track
and
neutralizing
it
or
in
saying
an
hour
beforehand
i
am
strike
the
last
method
is
calculated
to
scatter
the
fluids
to
the
wind
and
paralyze
the
powers
of
the
assailant
in
magic
any
act
known
and
made
public
is
lost
as
for
the
shock
in
return
one
must
also
know
beforehand
of
the
attempt
if
one
is
to
cast
back
the
spells
on
the
person
sending
them
before
one
is
struck
by
them
i
was
certain
to
perish
a
day
had
passed
since
i
was
bewitched
two
days
more
and
i
should
have
been
ready
for
the
cemetery
how
that
every
individual
struck
by
magic
has
three
days
in
which
to
take
measures
that
time
past
the
ill
is
incurable
so
when
docre
announced
to
me
that
he
condemned
me
to
death
by
his
own
authority
and
when
two
hours
later
on
returning
home
i
felt
desperately
ill
i
lost
no
time
packing
my
grip
and
starting
for
lyons
and
there
asked
durtal
there
i
saw
johannès
i
told
him
of
docre
threat
and
of
my
illness
he
said
to
me
simply
priest
can
dress
the
most
virulent
poisons
in
the
most
frightful
sacrileges
the
fight
will
be
bitter
but
i
shall
conquer
and
he
immediately
called
in
a
woman
who
lives
in
his
house
a
voyant
he
hypnotized
her
and
she
at
his
injunction
explained
the
nature
of
the
sorcery
of
which
i
was
the
victim
she
reconstructed
the
scene
she
literally
saw
me
being
poisoned
by
food
and
drink
mixed
with
menstrual
fluid
that
had
been
reinforced
with
macerated
sacramental
wafers
and
drugs
skilfully
dosed
that
sort
of
spell
is
so
terrible
that
aside
from
johannès
no
thaumaturge
in
france
dare
try
to
cure
it
so
the
doctor
finally
said
to
me
cure
can
be
obtained
only
through
an
invincible
power
we
must
lose
no
time
we
must
at
once
sacrifice
to
the
glory
of
melchisedek
he
raised
an
altar
composed
of
a
table
and
a
wooden
tabernacle
it
was
shaped
like
a
little
house
surmounted
by
a
cross
and
encircled
under
the
pediment
by
the
figure
of
the
tetragram
he
brought
the
silver
chalice
the
unleavened
bread
and
the
wine
he
donned
his
sacerdotal
habits
put
on
his
finger
the
ring
which
has
received
the
supreme
benedictions
then
he
began
to
read
from
a
special
missal
the
prayers
of
the
sacrifice
almost
at
once
the
voyant
cried
are
the
spirits
evoked
for
the
spell
these
are
they
which
have
carried
the
venefice
obedient
to
the
command
of
the
master
of
black
magic
canon
docre
i
was
sitting
beside
the
altar
johannès
placed
his
left
hand
on
my
head
and
raising
toward
heaven
his
right
he
besought
the
archangel
michael
to
assist
him
and
adjured
the
glorious
legions
of
the
invincible
seraphim
to
dominate
to
enchain
the
spirits
of
evil
i
was
already
feeling
greatly
relieved
the
sensation
of
internal
gnawing
which
tortured
me
in
paris
was
diminishing
johannès
continued
to
recite
his
orisons
then
when
the
moment
came
for
the
deprecatory
prayer
he
took
my
hand
laid
it
on
the
altar
and
three
times
chanted
the
projects
and
the
designs
of
the
worker
of
iniquity
who
has
made
enchantment
against
you
be
brought
to
naught
may
any
influence
obtained
by
satanic
means
any
attack
directed
against
you
be
null
and
void
of
effect
may
all
the
maledictions
of
your
enemy
be
transformed
into
benedictions
from
the
highest
summits
of
the
eternal
hills
may
his
fluids
of
death
be
transmuted
into
ferments
of
life
finally
may
the
archangels
of
judgment
and
chastisement
decide
the
fate
of
the
miserable
priest
who
has
put
his
trust
in
the
works
of
darkness
and
evil
he
said
to
me
delivered
heaven
has
cured
you
may
your
heart
therefore
repay
the
living
god
and
jesus
christ
through
the
glorious
mary
with
the
most
ardent
devotion
he
offered
me
unleavened
bread
and
wine
i
was
saved
you
who
are
a
physician
monsieur
des
hermies
can
bear
witness
that
human
science
was
impotent
to
aid
me
and
now
look
at
me
yes
des
hermies
replied
without
discussing
the
means
i
certify
the
cure
and
i
admit
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
to
my
knowledge
similar
results
have
been
no
thanks
to
mme
carhaix
who
was
inviting
him
to
take
another
helping
from
a
plate
of
sausages
with
horseradish
in
creamed
peas
but
said
durtal
permit
me
to
ask
you
several
questions
certain
details
interest
me
what
were
the
sacerdotal
ornaments
of
dr
johannès
his
costume
was
a
long
robe
of
vermilion
cashmere
caught
up
at
the
waist
by
a
red
and
white
sash
above
this
robe
he
had
a
white
mantle
of
the
same
stuff
cut
over
the
chest
in
the
form
of
a
cross
upside
down
cross
upside
down
yes
this
cross
reversed
like
the
figure
of
the
hanged
man
in
the
tarot
card
deck
signifies
that
the
priest
melchisedek
must
die
in
the
old
man
that
is
man
affected
by
original
sin
and
live
again
the
christ
to
be
powerful
with
the
power
of
the
incarnate
word
which
died
for
us
carhaix
seemed
ill
at
ease
his
fanatical
and
suspicious
catholicism
refused
to
countenance
any
save
the
prescribed
ceremonies
he
made
no
further
contribution
to
the
conversation
and
in
significant
silence
filled
the
glasses
seasoned
the
salad
and
passed
the
plates
what
sort
of
a
ring
was
that
you
spoke
of
it
is
a
symbolic
ring
of
pure
gold
it
has
the
image
of
a
serpent
whose
head
in
relief
set
with
a
ruby
is
connected
by
a
fine
chain
with
a
tiny
circlet
which
fastens
the
jaws
of
the
reptile
what
i
should
like
awfully
to
know
is
the
origin
and
the
aim
of
this
sacrifice
what
has
melchisedek
to
do
with
your
affair
ah
said
the
astrologer
melchisedek
is
one
of
the
most
mysterious
of
all
the
figures
in
the
holy
bible
he
was
king
of
salem
sacrificer
to
the
most
high
god
he
blessed
abraham
and
abraham
gave
him
tithes
of
the
spoil
of
the
vanquished
kings
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
that
is
the
story
in
genesis
but
saint
paul
cites
him
also
in
hebrews
and
in
the
third
verse
of
that
chapter
says
that
melchisedek
father
without
mother
without
descent
having
neither
beginning
of
day
nor
end
of
life
but
made
like
unto
the
son
of
god
abideth
a
priest
continually
in
hebrews
paul
quoting
psalm
says
jesus
is
called
priest
forever
after
the
order
of
melchisedek
all
this
you
see
is
obscure
enough
some
exegetes
recognize
in
him
the
prophetic
figure
of
the
saviour
others
that
of
saint
joseph
and
all
admit
that
the
sacrifice
of
melchisedek
offering
to
abraham
the
blood
and
wine
of
which
he
had
first
made
oblation
to
the
lord
prefigures
to
follow
the
expression
of
isidore
of
damietta
the
archetype
of
the
divine
mysteries
otherwise
known
as
the
holy
mass
very
well
said
des
hermies
but
all
that
scripture
does
not
explain
the
alexipharmacal
virtues
which
johannès
attributes
to
the
sacrifice
you
are
asking
more
than
i
can
answer
only
johannès
could
tell
you
this
much
i
can
say
theology
teaches
us
that
the
mass
as
it
is
celebrated
is
the
of
the
sacrifice
of
calvary
but
the
sacrifice
to
the
glory
of
melchisedek
is
not
that
it
is
in
some
sort
the
future
mass
the
glorious
office
which
will
be
known
during
the
earthly
reign
of
the
divine
paraclete
this
sacrifice
is
offered
to
god
by
man
regenerated
redeemed
by
the
infusion
of
the
love
of
the
holy
ghost
now
the
hominal
being
whose
heart
has
thus
been
purified
and
sanctified
is
invincible
and
the
enchantments
of
hell
can
not
prevail
against
him
if
he
makes
use
of
this
sacrifice
to
dissipate
the
spirits
of
evil
that
explains
to
you
the
potency
of
johannès
whose
heart
unites
in
this
ceremony
with
the
divine
heart
of
jesus
your
exposition
is
not
very
clear
carhaix
mildly
objected
then
it
must
be
supposed
that
johannès
is
a
man
amended
ahead
of
time
an
apostle
animated
by
the
holy
ghost
and
so
he
is
said
the
astrologer
firmly
assured
will
you
please
pass
the
gingerbread
carhaix
requested
here
the
way
to
fix
it
said
durtal
first
cut
a
slice
very
thin
then
take
a
slice
of
ordinary
bread
equally
thin
butter
them
and
put
them
together
now
tell
me
if
this
sandwich
has
the
exquisite
taste
of
fresh
walnuts
well
said
des
hermies
pursuing
his
aside
from
that
what
has
johannès
been
doing
in
this
long
time
since
i
last
saw
him
he
leads
what
ought
to
be
a
peaceful
life
he
lives
with
friends
who
revere
and
adore
him
with
them
he
rests
from
the
tribulations
of
all
sorts
save
one
that
he
has
been
subjected
to
he
would
be
perfectly
happy
if
he
did
not
have
to
repulse
the
attacks
launched
at
him
almost
daily
by
the
tonsured
magicians
of
rome
why
do
they
attack
him
a
thorough
explanation
would
take
a
long
time
johannès
is
commissioned
by
heaven
to
break
up
the
venomous
practises
of
satanism
and
to
preach
the
coming
of
the
glorified
christ
and
the
divine
paraclete
now
the
diabolical
curia
which
holds
the
vatican
in
its
clutches
has
every
reason
of
for
putting
out
of
the
way
a
man
whose
prayers
fetter
their
conjurements
and
neutralize
their
spells
ah
exclaimed
durtal
and
would
it
be
too
much
to
ask
you
how
this
former
priest
foresees
and
checks
these
astonishing
assaults
no
indeed
the
doctor
can
tell
by
the
flight
and
cry
of
certain
birds
falcons
and
male
are
his
sentinels
if
they
fly
toward
him
or
away
from
him
to
east
or
west
whether
they
emit
a
single
cry
or
many
these
are
omens
letting
him
know
the
hour
of
the
combat
so
that
he
can
be
on
guard
thus
he
told
me
one
day
the
are
easily
influenced
by
the
spirits
and
he
uses
them
as
the
hypnotist
makes
use
of
somnambulism
as
the
spiritist
makes
use
of
tables
and
slates
they
are
the
telegraph
wires
for
magic
despatches
yes
and
of
course
you
know
that
the
method
is
not
new
indeed
its
origin
is
lost
in
the
darkness
of
the
ages
ornithomancy
is
one
finds
traces
of
it
in
the
holy
bible
and
the
zohar
asserts
that
one
may
receive
numerous
notifications
if
one
knows
how
to
observe
the
flight
and
distinguish
the
cries
of
birds
but
said
durtal
why
is
the
chosen
in
preference
to
other
birds
well
it
has
always
been
since
remotest
antiquity
the
harbinger
of
charms
in
egypt
the
god
with
the
head
of
a
hawk
was
the
one
who
possessed
the
science
of
the
hieroglyphics
formerly
in
that
country
the
hierogrammatists
swallowed
the
heart
and
blood
of
the
hawk
to
prepare
themselves
for
the
magic
rites
even
today
african
chiefs
put
a
hawk
feather
in
their
hair
and
this
bird
is
sacred
in
india
how
does
your
friend
go
about
it
asked
mme
carhaix
raising
and
housing
birds
of
prey
because
that
is
what
they
are
he
does
not
raise
them
nor
house
them
they
nest
in
the
high
bluffs
along
the
saône
near
lyons
they
come
and
see
him
in
time
of
need
durtal
looking
around
this
cozy
and
recalling
the
extraordinary
conversations
which
had
been
held
here
was
thinking
how
far
we
are
from
the
language
and
the
ideas
of
modern
all
that
takes
us
back
to
the
middle
ages
he
said
finishing
his
thought
aloud
happily
exclaimed
carhaix
who
was
rising
to
go
and
ring
his
bells
yes
said
des
hermies
and
what
is
mighty
strange
in
this
day
of
crass
materialism
is
the
idea
of
battles
fought
in
space
over
the
cities
between
a
priest
of
lyons
and
prelates
of
rome
and
between
this
priest
and
the
rosicrusians
and
canon
docre
durtal
remembered
that
mme
chantelouve
had
assured
him
that
the
chiefs
of
the
rosicrucians
were
making
frantic
efforts
to
establish
connections
with
the
devil
and
prepare
spells
you
think
that
the
rosicrucians
are
satanizing
they
would
like
to
but
they
do
know
how
they
are
limited
to
reproducing
mechanically
the
few
fluidic
and
veniniferous
operations
revealed
to
them
by
the
three
brahmins
who
visited
paris
a
few
years
ago
i
am
thankful
myself
said
mme
carhaix
as
she
took
leave
of
the
company
that
i
am
not
mixed
up
in
any
of
this
frightful
business
and
that
i
can
pray
and
live
in
peace
then
while
des
hermies
as
usual
prepared
the
coffee
and
durtal
brought
the
liqueur
glasses
gévingey
filled
his
pipe
and
when
the
sound
of
the
bells
died
away
dispersed
and
as
if
absorbed
by
the
pores
of
the
wall
he
blew
out
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
and
said
i
passed
some
delightful
days
with
the
family
with
whom
johannès
is
living
after
the
shocks
which
i
had
received
it
was
a
privilege
without
equal
to
complete
my
convalescence
in
that
sweet
atmosphere
of
christian
love
and
too
johannès
is
of
all
men
i
have
ever
met
the
most
learned
in
the
occult
sciences
no
one
except
his
antithesis
the
abominable
docre
has
penetrated
so
far
into
the
arcana
of
satanism
one
may
even
say
that
in
france
these
two
are
the
only
ones
who
have
crossed
the
terrestrial
threshold
and
obtained
each
in
his
field
sure
results
but
in
addition
to
the
charm
of
his
conversation
and
the
scope
of
his
knowledge
for
even
on
the
subject
in
which
i
excel
that
of
astrology
he
surprised
me
johannès
delighted
me
with
the
beauty
of
his
vision
of
the
future
transformation
of
peoples
he
is
really
i
swear
the
prophet
whose
earthly
mission
of
suffering
and
glory
has
been
authorized
by
the
most
high
i
do
doubt
it
said
durtal
smiling
but
his
theory
of
the
paraclete
is
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
very
ancient
heresy
of
montanus
which
the
church
has
formally
condemned
all
depends
on
the
manner
in
which
the
coming
of
the
paraclete
is
conceived
interjected
the
returning
at
that
moment
it
is
also
the
orthodox
doctrine
of
saint
irenæus
saint
justin
scotus
erigena
amaury
of
chartres
saint
doucine
and
that
admirable
mystic
joachim
of
floris
this
was
the
belief
throughout
the
middle
ages
and
i
admit
that
it
obsesses
me
and
fills
me
with
joy
that
it
responds
to
the
most
ardent
of
my
yearnings
indeed
he
said
sitting
down
and
crossing
his
legs
if
the
third
kingdom
is
an
illusion
what
consolation
is
left
for
christians
in
face
of
the
general
disintegration
of
a
world
which
charity
requires
us
not
to
hate
i
am
furthermore
obliged
to
admit
said
des
hermies
that
in
spite
of
the
blood
shed
on
golgotha
i
personally
feel
as
if
my
ransom
had
not
been
quite
effected
there
are
three
kingdoms
the
astrologer
resumed
pressing
down
the
ashes
of
his
pipe
with
his
finger
of
the
old
testament
that
of
the
father
the
kingdom
of
fear
of
the
new
testament
that
of
the
son
the
kingdom
of
expiation
of
the
johannite
gospel
that
of
the
holy
ghost
the
kingdom
of
redemption
and
love
they
are
the
past
present
and
future
winter
spring
and
summer
the
first
says
joachim
of
floris
gives
us
the
blade
the
second
the
leaf
and
the
third
the
ear
two
of
the
persons
of
the
trinity
have
shown
themselves
logically
the
third
must
appear
yes
and
the
biblical
texts
abound
conclusive
explicit
irrefutable
said
carhaix
all
the
prophets
isaiah
ezekiel
daniel
zachariah
malachi
speak
of
it
the
acts
of
the
apostles
is
very
precise
on
this
point
in
the
first
chapter
you
will
read
these
lines
same
jesus
which
is
taken
up
from
you
into
heaven
shall
so
come
in
like
manner
as
ye
have
seen
him
go
into
heaven
saint
john
also
announces
the
tidings
in
the
apocalypse
which
is
the
gospel
of
the
second
coming
of
christ
shall
come
and
reign
a
thousand
years
saint
paul
is
inexhaustible
in
revelations
of
this
nature
in
the
epistle
to
timothy
he
invokes
the
lord
shall
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
at
his
appearance
and
his
kingdom
in
the
second
epistle
to
the
thessalonians
he
writes
then
shall
that
wicked
be
revealed
whom
the
lord
shall
consume
with
the
spirit
of
his
mouth
and
shall
destroy
with
the
brightness
of
his
coming
now
he
declares
that
the
antichrist
is
not
yet
so
the
coming
which
he
prophesies
is
not
that
already
realized
by
the
birth
of
the
saviour
at
bethlehem
in
the
gospel
according
to
saint
matthew
jesus
responds
to
caiaphas
who
asks
him
if
he
is
the
christ
son
of
god
hast
said
and
nevertheless
i
say
unto
you
hereafter
shall
ye
see
the
son
of
man
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
power
and
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
in
another
verse
he
says
to
his
apostles
therefore
for
ye
know
not
what
hour
your
lord
doth
come
and
there
are
other
texts
i
could
put
my
finger
on
no
there
is
no
use
in
talking
the
partisans
of
the
glorious
kingdom
are
supported
with
certitude
by
inspired
passages
and
can
under
certain
conditions
and
without
fear
of
heresy
uphold
this
doctrine
which
saint
jerome
attests
was
in
the
fourth
century
a
dogma
of
faith
recognized
by
all
but
what
say
we
taste
a
bit
of
this
crême
de
céléri
which
monsieur
durtal
praises
so
highly
it
was
a
thick
liqueur
sirupy
like
anisette
but
even
sweeter
and
more
feminine
only
when
one
had
swallowed
this
inert
there
lingered
in
the
roots
of
the
papillæ
a
faint
taste
of
celery
it
is
bad
said
the
astrologer
but
there
no
life
to
it
and
he
poured
into
his
glass
a
stiff
tot
of
rum
come
to
think
of
it
said
durtal
the
third
kingdom
is
also
announced
in
the
words
of
the
paternoster
kingdom
come
certainly
said
the
but
you
see
interjected
gévingey
heresy
would
gain
the
upper
hand
and
the
whole
belief
would
be
turned
into
nonsense
and
absurdity
if
we
admitted
as
certain
paracletists
do
an
authentic
fleshly
incarnation
for
instance
remember
fareinism
which
has
been
rife
since
the
eighteenth
century
in
fareins
a
village
of
the
doubs
where
jansenism
took
refuge
when
driven
out
of
paris
after
the
closing
of
the
cemetery
of
saint
médard
there
a
priest
françois
bonjour
reproduced
the
orgies
which
under
the
regency
desecrated
the
tomb
of
deacon
paris
then
bonjour
had
an
affair
with
a
woman
and
she
claimed
to
be
big
with
the
prophet
elijah
who
according
to
the
apocalypse
is
to
precede
the
last
arrival
of
christ
this
child
came
into
the
world
then
there
was
a
second
who
was
none
other
than
the
paraclete
the
latter
did
business
as
a
woolen
merchant
in
paris
was
a
colonel
in
the
national
guard
under
and
died
in
easy
circumstances
in
a
tradesman
paraclete
a
redeemer
with
epaulettes
and
gold
braid
in
one
dame
brochard
of
vouvray
affirmed
to
whoever
would
listen
that
jesus
was
reincarnate
in
her
in
a
pious
madman
named
david
published
at
angers
a
brochure
entitled
voice
of
in
which
he
assumed
the
modest
appellation
of
messiah
of
the
creator
holy
ghost
and
informed
the
world
that
he
was
a
sewer
contractor
and
wore
a
beard
a
yard
and
a
half
long
at
the
present
moment
his
throne
is
not
empty
for
want
of
successors
an
engineer
named
pierre
jean
rode
all
over
the
mediterranean
provinces
on
horseback
announcing
that
he
was
the
holy
ghost
in
paris
bérard
an
omnibus
conductor
on
the
line
likewise
asserts
that
he
incorporates
the
paraclete
while
a
magazine
article
avers
that
the
hope
of
redemption
has
dawned
in
the
person
of
the
poet
jhouney
finally
in
america
from
time
to
time
women
claim
to
be
messiahs
and
they
recruit
adherents
among
persons
worked
up
to
fever
pitch
by
advent
revivals
they
are
no
worse
than
the
people
who
deny
god
and
creation
said
carhaix
god
is
immanent
in
his
creatures
he
is
their
life
principle
the
source
of
movement
the
foundation
of
existence
says
saint
paul
he
has
his
personal
existence
being
the
am
as
moses
says
the
holy
ghost
through
christ
in
glory
will
be
immanent
in
all
beings
he
will
be
the
principle
which
transforms
and
regenerates
them
but
there
is
no
need
for
him
to
be
incarnate
the
holy
ghost
proceeds
from
the
father
through
the
son
he
is
sent
to
act
not
to
materialize
himself
it
is
downright
madness
to
maintain
the
contrary
thus
falling
into
the
heresies
of
the
gnostics
and
the
fratricelli
into
the
errors
of
dulcin
de
novare
and
his
wife
marguerite
into
the
filth
of
abbé
beccarelli
and
the
abominations
of
segarelli
of
parma
who
on
pretext
of
becoming
a
child
the
better
to
symbolize
the
simple
naïf
love
of
the
paraclete
had
himself
diapered
and
slept
on
the
breast
of
a
nurse
but
said
durtal
you
have
made
yourself
quite
clear
to
me
if
i
understand
you
the
holy
ghost
will
act
by
an
infusion
into
us
he
will
transmute
us
renovate
our
souls
by
a
sort
of
purgation
to
drop
into
the
theological
vernacular
yes
he
will
purify
us
soul
and
body
how
will
he
purify
our
bodies
the
action
of
the
paraclete
the
astrologer
struck
in
will
extend
to
the
principle
of
generation
the
divine
life
will
sanctify
the
organs
which
henceforth
can
procreate
only
elect
creatures
exempt
from
original
sin
creatures
whom
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
test
in
the
fires
of
humiliation
as
the
holy
bible
says
this
was
the
doctrine
of
the
prophet
vintras
that
extraordinary
unlettered
man
who
wrote
such
impressive
and
ardent
pages
the
doctrine
has
been
continued
and
amplified
since
vintras
death
by
his
successor
dr
johannès
then
there
is
to
be
paradise
on
earth
said
des
hermies
yes
the
kingdom
of
liberty
goodness
and
love
you
got
me
all
mixed
up
said
durtal
now
you
announce
the
arrival
of
the
holy
ghost
now
the
glorious
advent
of
christ
are
these
kingdoms
identical
or
is
one
to
follow
the
other
there
is
a
distinction
answered
gévingey
between
the
coming
of
the
paraclete
and
the
victorious
return
of
christ
they
occur
in
the
order
named
first
a
society
must
be
recreated
embraced
by
the
third
hypostasis
by
love
in
order
that
jesus
may
descend
as
he
has
promised
from
the
clouds
and
reign
over
the
people
formed
in
his
image
what
rôle
is
the
pope
to
play
ah
that
is
one
of
the
most
curious
points
of
the
johannite
doctrine
time
since
the
first
appearance
of
the
messiah
is
divided
as
you
know
into
two
periods
the
period
of
the
victim
of
the
expiant
saviour
the
period
in
which
we
now
are
and
the
other
that
which
we
await
the
period
of
christ
bathed
in
the
spittle
of
mockery
but
radiant
with
the
superadorable
splendour
of
his
person
well
there
is
a
different
pope
for
each
of
these
eras
the
scriptures
announce
these
two
sovereign
pontificates
and
so
do
my
horoscopes
for
that
matter
it
is
an
axiom
of
theology
that
the
spirit
of
peter
lives
in
his
successors
it
will
live
in
them
more
or
less
hidden
until
the
expansion
of
the
holy
ghost
then
john
who
has
been
held
in
reserve
as
the
gospel
says
will
begin
his
ministry
of
love
and
will
live
in
the
souls
of
the
new
popes
i
do
understand
the
utility
of
a
pope
when
jesus
is
to
be
visible
said
des
hermies
to
tell
the
truth
there
is
no
use
in
having
one
and
the
papacy
is
to
exist
only
during
the
epoch
reserved
for
the
effluence
of
the
divine
paraclete
the
day
on
which
in
a
shower
of
meteors
jesus
appears
the
pontificate
of
rome
ceases
without
going
more
deeply
into
questions
which
we
could
discuss
the
rest
of
our
lives
said
durtal
i
marvel
at
the
placidity
of
the
utopian
who
imagines
that
man
is
perfectible
there
is
no
denying
that
the
human
creature
is
born
selfish
abusive
vile
just
look
around
you
and
see
society
cynical
and
ferocious
the
humble
heckled
and
pillaged
by
the
rich
traffickers
in
necessities
everywhere
the
triumph
of
the
mediocre
and
unscrupulous
everywhere
the
apotheosis
of
crooked
politics
and
finance
and
you
think
you
can
make
any
progress
against
a
stream
like
that
no
man
has
never
changed
his
soul
was
corrupt
in
the
days
of
genesis
and
is
not
less
rotten
at
present
only
the
form
of
his
sins
varies
progress
is
the
hypocrisy
which
refines
the
vices
all
the
more
reason
carhaix
rejoined
why
society
if
it
is
as
you
have
described
it
should
fall
to
pieces
i
too
think
it
is
putrefied
its
bones
ulcerated
its
flesh
dropping
off
it
can
neither
be
poulticed
nor
cured
it
must
be
interred
and
a
new
one
born
and
who
but
god
can
accomplish
such
a
miracle
if
we
admit
said
des
hermies
that
the
infamousness
of
the
times
is
transitory
it
is
that
only
the
intervention
of
a
god
can
wash
it
away
for
neither
socialism
nor
any
other
chimera
of
the
ignorant
and
workers
will
modify
human
nature
and
reform
the
peoples
these
tasks
are
above
human
forces
and
the
time
awaited
by
johannès
is
at
hand
gévingey
proclaimed
here
are
some
of
the
manifest
proofs
raymond
lully
asserted
that
the
end
of
the
old
world
would
be
announced
by
the
diffusion
of
the
doctrines
of
antichrist
he
defined
these
doctrines
they
are
materialism
and
the
monstrous
revival
of
magic
this
prediction
applies
to
our
age
i
think
on
the
other
hand
the
good
tidings
was
to
be
realized
according
to
our
lord
as
reported
by
saint
matthew
ye
shall
see
the
abomination
of
desolation
stand
in
the
holy
place
and
is
it
standing
in
the
holy
place
now
look
at
our
timorous
skeptical
pope
lukewarm
and
politic
our
episcopate
of
simonists
and
cowards
our
flabby
indulgent
clergy
see
how
they
are
ravaged
by
satanism
then
tell
me
if
the
church
can
fall
any
lower
the
promises
are
explicit
and
can
not
fail
and
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
his
chin
in
his
hands
and
his
eyes

des

we
were
going
while
they
were
putting
on
their
coats
carhaix
questioned
durtal
what
do
you
hope
for
if
you
have
no
faith
in
the
coming
of
christ
i
hope
for
nothing
at

that

the
raised
his
hands
and
sadly
shook
his
head
when
they
had
left
gévingey
des
hermies
after
walking
in
silence
for
some
time
said
you
are
not
astonished
that
all
the
events
spoken
of
tonight
happened
at
lyons
and
as
durtal
looked
at
him
inquiringly
he
continued
you
see
i
am
well
acquainted
with
lyons
people
brains
there
are
as
foggy
as
the
streets
when
the
morning
mists
roll
up
from
the
rhone
that
city
looks
magnificent
to
travellers
who
like
the
long
avenues
wide
boulevards
green
grass
and
penitentiary
architecture
of
modern
cities
but
lyons
is
also
the
refuge
of
mysticism
the
haven
of
preternatural
ideas
and
doubtful
creeds
that
where
vintras
died
the
one
in
whom
it
seems
the
soul
of
the
prophet
elijah
was
incarnate
that
where
naundorff
found
his
last
partisans
that
is
where
enchantment
is
rampant
because
in
the
suburb
of
la
guillotière
you
can
have
a
person
bewitched
for
a
louis
add
that
it
is
likewise
in
spite
of
its
swarms
of
radicals
and
anarchists
an
opulent

a
dour

lyons
is
celebrated
for

silk
and
churches
at
the
top
of
every
hill
and
there
a
hill
every
block
is
a
chapel
or
a
convent
and
notre
dame
de
fourvière
dominates
them
all
from
a
distance
this
pile
looks
like
an
eighteenth
century
dresser
turned
upside
down
but
the
interior
which
is
in
process
of
completion
is
amazing
you
ought
to
go
and
take
a
look
at
it
some
day
you
will
see
the
most
extraordinary
jumble
of
assyrian
roman
gothic
and
god

what
jacked
together
by

the
only
architect
for
a
century
who
has
known
how
to
create
a
cathedral
interior
the
nave
glitters
with
inlays
and
marble
with
bronze
and
gold
statues
of
angels
diversify
the
rows
of
columns
and
break
up
with
impressive
grace
the
known
harmonies
of
line
it
asiatic
and
barbarous
and
reminds
one
of
the
architecture
shown
in
gustave
moreau
hérodiade
and
there
is
an
endless
stream
of
pilgrims
they
strike
bargains
with
our
lady
they
pray
for
an
extension
of
markets
new
outlets
for
sausages
and
silks
they
consult
her
on
ways
and
means
of
getting
rid
of
spoiled
vegetables
and
pushing
off
their
shoddy
in
the
centre
of
the
city
in
the
church
of
saint
boniface
i
found
a
placard
requesting
the
faithful
out
of
respect
for
the
holy
place
not
to
give
alms
it
was
not
seemly
you
see
that
the
commercial
orisons
be
disturbed
by
the
ridiculous
plaints
of
the
indigent
well
said
durtal
it
a
strange
thing
but
democracy
is
the
most
implacable
of
the
enemies
of
the
poor
the
revolution
which
you
would
think
ought
to
have
protected
them
proved
for
them
the
most
cruel
of
régimes
i
will
show
you
some
day
a
decree
of
the
year
ii
pronouncing
penalties
not
only
for
those
who
begged
but
for
those
who
gave
and
yet
democracy
is
the
panacea
which
is
going
to
cure
every
ill
said
des
hermies
laughing
and
he
pointed
to
enormous
posters
everywhere
in
which
general
boulanger
peremptorily
demanded
that
the
people
of
paris
vote
for
him
in
the
coming
election
durtal
shrugged
his
shoulders
quite
true
the
people
are
very
sick
carhaix
and
gévingey
are
perhaps
right
in
maintaining
that
no
human
agency
is
powerful
enough
to
effect

chapter

durtal
had
resolved
not
to
answer
mme
chantelouve
letters
every
day
since
their
rupture
she
had
sent
him
an
inflamed
missive
but
as
he
soon
noticed
her
mænad
cries
were
subsiding
into
plaints
and
reproaches
she
now
accused
him
of
ingratitude
and
repented
having
listened
to
him
and
having
permitted
him
to
participate
in
sacrileges
for
which
she
would
have
to
answer
before
the
heavenly
tribunal
she
pleaded
to
see
him
once
more
then
she
was
silent
for
a
while
week
finally
tired
no
doubt
of
writing
unanswered
letters
she
admitted
in
a
last
epistle
that
all
was
over
after
agreeing
with
him
that
their
temperaments
were
incompatible
she
ended
thanks
for
the
trig
little
love
ruled
like
that
you
gave
me
my
heart
can
not
be
so
straitly
measured
it
requires
more
latitude
her
heart
he
laughed
then
he
continued
to
read
i
understand
that
it
is
not
your
earthly
mission
to
satisfy
my
heart
but
you
might
at
least
have
conceded
me
a
frank
comradeship
which
would
have
permitted
me
to
leave
my
sex
at
home
and
to
come
and
spend
an
evening
with
you
now
and
then
this
seemingly
so
simple
you
have
rendered
impossible
farewell
forever
i
have
only
to
renew
my
pact
with
solitude
to
which
i
have
tried
to
be
unfaithful
with
solitude
and
that
complaisant
and
paternal
cuckold
her
husband
well
he
is
the
one
most
to
be
pitied
now
thanks
to
me
he
had
evenings
of
quiet
i
restored
his
wife
pliant
and
satisfied
he
profited
by
my
fatigues
that
sacristan
ah
when
i
think
of
it
his
sly
hypocritical
eyes
when
he
looked
at
me
told
me
a
great
deal
well
the
little
romance
is
over
it
a
good
thing
to
have
your
heart
on
strike
in
my
brain
i
still
have
a
house
of
ill
fame
which
sometimes
catches
fire
but
the
hired
myrmidons
will
stamp
out
the
blaze
in
a
hurry
when
i
was
young
and
ardent
the
women
laughed
at
me
now
that
i
am
old
and
stale
i
laugh
at
them
that
more
in
my
character
old
fellow
he
said
to
the
cat
which
with
ears
pricked
up
was
listening
to
the
soliloquy
truly
gilles
de
rais
is
a
great
deal
more
interesting
than
mme
chantelouve
unfortunately
my
relations
with
him
are
also
drawing
to
a
close
only
a
few
more
pages
and
the
book
is
done
oh
lord
here
comes
rateau
to
knock
my
house
to
pieces
sure
enough
the
concierge
entered
made
an
excuse
for
being
late
took
off
his
vest
and
cast
a
look
of
defiance
at
the
furniture
then
he
hurled
himself
at
the
bed
grappled
with
the
mattress
got
a
on
it
and
balancing
himself
turning
half
around
hurled
it
onto
the
springs
durtal
followed
by
his
cat
went
into
the
other
room
but
suddenly
rateau
ceased
wrestling
and
came
and
stood
before
durtal
monsieur
do
you
know
what
has
happened
he
blubbered
why
no
my
wife
has
left
me
left
you
but
she
must
be
over
sixty
rateau
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
she
ran
off
with
another
man
rateau
disconsolate
let
the
feather
duster
fall
from
his
listless
hand
the
devil
then
in
spite
of
her
age
your
wife
had
needs
which
you
were
unable
to
satisfy
the
concierge
shook
his
head
and
finally
succeeded
in
saying
it
was
the
other
way
around
oh
said
durtal
considering
the
old
caricature
shrivelled
by
bad
air
and
but
if
she
is
tired
of
that
sort
of
thing
why
did
she
run
off
with
a
man
rateau
made
a
grimace
of
pitying
contempt
oh
he
impotent
good
for
nothing
ah
it
my
job
i
sore
about
the
landlord
wo
keep
a
concierge
that
has
a
wife
dear
lord
thought
durtal
how
hast
thou
answered
my
prayers
come
on
let
go
over
to
your
place
he
said
to
des
hermies
who
finding
rateau
key
in
the
door
had
walked
in
righto
since
your
housecleaning
is
done
yet
descend
like
a
god
from
your
clouds
of
dust
and
come
on
over
to
the
house
on
the
way
durtal
recounted
his
concierge
conjugal
misadventure
oh
said
des
hermies
many
a
woman
would
be
happy
to
wreathe
with
laurel
the
occiput
of
so
combustible
a
look
at
that
is
it
revolting
pointing
to
the
walls
covered
with
posters
it
was
a
veritable
debauch
of
placards
everywhere
on
lurid
coloured
paper
in
box
car
letters
were
the
names
of
boulanger
and
jacques
thank
god
this
will
be
over
tomorrow
there
is
one
resource
left
said
des
hermies
to
escape
the
horrors
of
present
day
life
never
raise
your
eyes
look
down
at
the
sidewalk
always
preserving
the
attitude
of
timid
modesty
when
you
look
only
at
the
pavement
you
see
the
reflections
of
the
sky
signs
in
all
sorts
of
fantastic
shapes
alchemic
symbols
talismanic
characters
bizarre
pantacles
with
suns
hammers
and
anchors
and
you
can
imagine
yourself
right
in
the
midst
of
the
middle
ages
yes
but
to
keep
from
seeing
the
disenchanting
crowd
you
would
have
to
wear
a
cap
like
a
jockey
and
blinkers
like
a
horse
des
hermies
sighed
come
in
he
said
opening
the
door
they
went
in
and
sitting
down
in
easy
chairs
they
lighted
their
cigarettes
i
have
got
over
that
conversation
we
had
with
gévingey
the
other
night
at
carhaix
said
durtal
strange
man
that
johannès
i
ca
keep
from
thinking
about
him
look
here
do
you
sincerely
believe
in
his
miraculous
cures
i
am
obliged
to
i
did
tell
you
all
about
him
for
a
physician
lightly
make
these
dangerous
admissions
but
you
may
as
well
know
that
this
priest
heals
hopeless
cases
i
got
acquainted
with
him
when
he
was
still
a
member
of
the
parisian
clergy
it
came
about
by
one
of
those
miracles
of
his
which
i
pretend
to
understand
my
mother
maid
had
a
granddaughter
who
was
paralyzed
in
her
arms
and
legs
and
suffered
death
and
destruction
in
her
chest
and
howled
when
you
touched
her
there
she
had
been
in
this
condition
two
years
it
had
come
on
in
one
night
how
produced
nobody
knows
she
was
sent
away
from
the
lyons
hospitals
as
incurable
she
came
to
paris
underwent
treatment
at
la
salpêtrière
and
was
discharged
when
nobody
could
find
out
what
was
the
matter
with
her
nor
what
medication
would
give
her
any
relief
one
day
she
spoke
to
me
of
this
abbé
johannès
who
she
said
had
cured
persons
in
as
bad
shape
as
she
i
did
not
believe
a
word
but
hearing
that
the
priest
refused
to
take
any
money
for
his
services
i
did
not
dissuade
her
from
visiting
him
and
out
of
curiosity
i
went
along
they
placed
her
in
a
chair
the
ecclesiastic
little
active
energetic
took
her
hand
and
applied
to
it
one
after
the
other
three
precious
stones
then
he
said
coolly
you
are
the
victim
of
consanguineal
sorcery
i
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
he
said
years
back
for
that
is
when
your
paralytic
stroke
came
on
you
must
have
had
a
quarrel
with
a
kinsman
or
kinswoman
it
was
true
poor
marie
had
been
unjustly
accused
of
the
theft
of
a
watch
which
was
an
heirloom
belonging
to
an
aunt
of
hers
the
aunt
had
sworn
vengeance
aunt
lives
in
lyons
she
nodded
astonishing
about
that
continued
the
priest
lyons
among
the
lower
orders
there
are
witch
doctors
who
know
a
little
about
the
witchcraft
practised
in
the
country
but
be
reassured
these
people
are
not
powerful
they
know
little
more
than
the
a
b
c
of
the
art
then
mademoiselle
you
wish
to
be
cured
and
after
she
replied
that
she
did
he
said
gently
is
all
you
may
go
he
did
not
touch
her
did
not
prescribe
any
remedy
i
came
away
persuaded
that
he
was
a
mountebank
but
when
three
days
later
the
girl
was
able
to
raise
her
arms
and
all
her
pain
had
left
her
and
when
at
the
end
of
a
week
she
could
walk
i
had
to
yield
in
face
of
the
evidence
i
went
back
to
see
him
had
occasion
to
do
him
a
service
and
thus
our
relations
began
but
what
are
his
methods
he
opens
like
the
curate
of
ars
with
prayer
then
he
evokes
the
militant
archangels
then
he
breaks
the
magic
circles
and
chases
as
he
says
the
spirits
of
evil
i
know
very
well
that
this
is
confounding
whenever
i
speak
of
this
man
potency
to
my
confrères
they
smile
with
a
superior
air
or
serve
up
to
me
the
specious
arguments
which
they
have
fabricated
to
explain
the
cures
wrought
by
christ
and
the
virgin
the
method
they
have
imagined
consists
in
striking
the
patient
imagination
suggesting
to
him
the
will
to
be
cured
persuading
him
that
he
is
well
hypnotizing
him
in
a
waking
state
so
to
speak
this
done
say
they
the
twisted
legs
straighten
the
sores
disappear
the
lungs
are
patched
up
the
cancers
become
benign
pimples
and
the
blind
eyes
see
this
procedure
they
attribute
to
miracle
workers
to
explain
away
the
supernatural
why
do
they
use
the
method
themselves
if
it
is
so
simple
but
have
they
tried
after
a
fashion
i
was
present
myself
at
an
experiment
attempted
by
luys
ah
it
was
inspiring
at
the
charity
hospital
there
was
a
poor
girl
paralyzed
in
both
legs
she
was
put
to
sleep
and
commanded
to
rise
she
struggled
in
vain
then
two
interns
held
her
up
in
a
standing
posture
but
her
lifeless
legs
bent
useless
under
her
weight
need
i
tell
you
that
she
could
not
walk
and
that
after
they
had
held
her
up
and
pushed
her
along
a
few
steps
they
put
her
to
bed
again
having
obtained
no
result
whatever
but
johannès
does
not
cure
all
sufferers
without
discrimination
no
he
will
not
meddle
with
any
ailments
which
are
not
the
result
of
spells
he
says
he
can
do
nothing
with
natural
ills
which
are
the
province
of
the
physician
he
is
a
specialist
in
satanic
affections
he
has
most
to
do
with
the
possessed
whose
neuroses
have
proved
obdurate
to
hydrotherapeutic
treatment
what
does
he
do
with
the
precious
stones
you
mentioned
first
before
answering
your
question
i
must
explain
the
significance
and
virtue
of
these
stones
i
shall
be
telling
you
nothing
new
when
i
say
that
aristotle
pliny
all
the
sages
of
antiquity
attributed
medical
and
divine
virtues
to
them
according
to
the
pagans
agate
and
carnelian
stimulate
topaz
consoles
jasper
cures
languor
hyacinth
drives
away
insomnia
turquoise
prevents
falls
or
lightens
the
shock
amethyst
combats
drunkenness
catholic
symbolism
in
its
turn
takes
over
the
precious
stones
and
sees
in
them
emblems
of
the
christian
virtues
then
sapphire
represents
the
lofty
aspirations
of
the
soul
chalcedony
charity
sard
and
onyx
candor
beryl
allegorizes
theological
science
hyacinthe
humility
while
the
ruby
appeases
wrath
and
emerald
incorruptible
faith
now
in
magic
des
hermies
rose
and
took
from
a
shelf
a
very
small
volume
bound
like
a
prayer
book
he
showed
durtal
the
title
magic
or
the
secrets
and
miracles
of
nature
in
four
volumes
by
giambattista
porta
of
naples
paris
nicolas
bonjour
rue
neuve
nostre
dame
at
the
sign
saint
natural
magic
said
des
hermies
which
was
merely
the
medicine
of
the
time
ascribes
a
new
meaning
to
gems
listen
to
this
after
first
celebrating
an
unknown
stone
the
alectorius
which
renders
its
possessor
invincible
if
it
has
been
taken
out
of
the
stomach
of
a
cock
caponized
four
years
before
or
if
it
has
been
ripped
out
of
the
ventricle
of
a
hen
porta
informs
us
that
chalcedony
wins
law
suits
that
carnelian
stops
bloody
flux
is
exceeding
useful
to
women
who
are
sick
of
their
flower
that
hyacinth
protects
against
lightning
and
keeps
away
pestilence
and
poison
that
topaz
quells
passions
that
turquoise
is
of
advantage
against
melancholy
quartan
fever
and
heart
failure
he
attests
finally
that
sapphire
preserves
courage
and
keeps
the
members
vigorous
while
emerald
hung
about
one
neck
keeps
away
saint
john
evil
and
breaks
when
the
wearer
is
unchaste
you
see
antique
philosophy
mediæval
christianity
and
sixteenth
century
magic
do
not
agree
on
the
specific
virtues
of
every
stone
almost
in
every
case
the
significations
more
or
less
differ
johannès
has
revised
these
beliefs
adopted
and
rejected
great
numbers
of
them
finally
he
has
on
his
own
authority
admitted
new
acceptations
according
to
him
amethyst
does
cure
drunkenness
but
moral
drunkenness
pride
ruby
relieves
sex
pressure
beryl
fortifies
the
will
sapphire
elevates
the
thoughts
and
turns
them
toward
god
in
brief
he
believes
that
every
stone
corresponds
to
a
species
of
malady
and
also
to
a
class
of
sins
and
he
affirms
that
when
we
have
chemically
got
possession
of
the
active
principle
of
gems
we
shall
have
not
only
antidotes
but
preventatives
while
waiting
for
this
chimerical
dream
to
be
realized
and
for
our
medicine
to
become
the
mock
of
lapidary
chemists
he
uses
precious
stones
to
formulate
diagnoses
of
illnesses
produced
by
sorcery
how
he
claims
that
when
such
or
such
a
stone
is
placed
in
the
hand
or
on
the
affected
part
of
the
bewitched
a
fluid
escapes
from
the
stone
into
his
hands
and
that
by
examining
this
fluid
he
can
tell
what
is
the
matter
in
this
connection
he
told
me
that
a
woman
whom
he
did
not
know
came
to
him
one
day
to
consult
him
about
a
malady
pronounced
incurable
from
which
she
had
suffered
since
childhood
he
could
not
get
any
precise
answers
to
his
questions
he
saw
no
signs
of
venefice
after
trying
out
his
whole
array
of
stones
he
placed
in
her
hand
lapis
lazuli
which
he
says
corresponds
to
the
sin
of
incest
he
examined
the
stone
malady
he
said
the
consequence
of
an
act
of
incest
she
said
did
not
come
here
to
confessional
but
she
finally
admitted
that
her
father
had
violated
her
before
she
attained
the
age
of
puberty
that
of
course
is
against
reason
and
contrary
to
all
accepted
ideas
but
there
is
no
getting
around
the
fact
that
this
priest
cures
patients
whom
we
physicians
have
given
up
for
lost
such
as
the
only
astrologer
paris
now
can
boast
the
astounding
gévingey
who
would
have
been
dead
without
his
aid
i
wonder
how
gévingey
came
to
cast
the
empress
eugenie
horoscope
oh
i
told
you
under
the
empire
the
tuileries
was
a
hotbed
of
magic
home
the
american
was
revered
as
the
equal
of
a
god
in
addition
to
spiritualistic
séances
he
evoked
demons
at
court
one
evocation
had
fatal
consequences
a
certain
marquis
whose
wife
had
died
implored
home
to
let
him
see
her
again
home
took
him
to
a
room
put
him
in
bed
and
left
him
what
ensued
what
dreadful
phantom
rose
from
the
tomb
was
the
story
of
ligeia
at
any
rate
the
marquis
was
found
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
this
story
has
recently
been
reported
by
le
figaro
from
unimpeachable
documents
you
see
it
wo
do
to
play
with
the
world
spirits
of
evil
i
used
to
know
a
rich
bachelor
who
had
a
mania
for
the
occult
sciences
he
was
president
of
a
theosophic
society
and
he
even
wrote
a
little
book
on
the
esoteric
doctrine
in
the
isis
series
well
he
could
not
like
the
péladan
and
papus
tribe
be
content
with
knowing
nothing
so
he
went
to
scotland
where
diabolism
is
rampant
there
he
got
in
touch
with
the
man
who
if
you
stake
him
will
initiate
you
into
the
satanic
arcana
my
friend
made
the
experiment
did
he
see
him
whom
bulwer
lytton
in
calls
dweller
of
the
threshold
i
do
know
but
certain
it
is
that
he
fainted
from
horror
and
returned
to
france
exhausted
half
dead
evidently
all
is
not
rosy
in
that
line
of
work
said
durtal
but
it
is
only
spirits
of
evil
that
can
be
evoked
do
you
suppose
that
the
angels
who
of
earth
obey
only
the
saints
would
ever
consent
to
take
orders
from
the
first
comer
but
there
must
be
an
intermediate
order
of
angels
who
are
neither
celestial
nor
infernal
who
for
instance
commit
the
asininities
in
the
spiritist
séances
a
priest
told
me
one
day
that
the
neuter
larvæ
inhabit
an
invisible
neutral
territory
something
like
a
little
island
which
is
beseiged
on
all
sides
by
the
good
and
evil
spirits
the
larvæ
can
not
long
hold
out
and
are
soon
forced
into
one
or
the
other
camp
now
because
it
is
these
larvæ
they
evoke
the
occultists
who
can
not
of
course
draw
down
the
angels
always
get
the
ones
who
have
joined
the
party
of
evil
so
unconsciously
and
probably
involuntarily
the
spiritist
is
always
diabolizing
yes
and
if
one
admits
the
disgusting
idea
that
an
imbecile
medium
can
bring
back
the
dead
one
must
in
reason
recognize
the
stamp
of
satan
on
these
practises
however
viewed
spiritism
is
an
abomination
so
you
do
believe
in
theurgy
white
magic
it
a
joke
only
a
rosicrucian
who
wants
to
hide
his
more
repulsive
essays
at
black
magic
ever
hints
at
such
a
thing
no
one
dare
confess
that
he
satanizes
the
church
not
duped
by
these
distinctions
condemns
black
and
white
magic
indifferently
well
said
durtal
lighting
a
cigarette
after
a
silence
this
is
a
better
topic
of
conversation
than
politics
or
the
races
but
where
does
it
get
us
half
of
these
doctrines
are
absurd
the
other
half
so
mysterious
as
to
produce
only
bewilderment
shall
we
grant
satanism
well
gross
as
it
is
it
seems
a
sure
thing
and
if
it
is
and
one
is
consistent
one
must
also
grant
catholicism
for
buddhism
and
the
like
are
not
big
enough
to
be
substituted
for
the
religion
of
christ
all
right
believe
i
ca
there
are
so
many
discouraging
and
revolting
dogmas
in
christianity
i
am
uncertain
about
a
good
many
things
myself
said
des
hermies
and
yet
there
are
moments
when
i
feel
that
the
obstacles
are
giving
way
that
i
almost
believe
of
one
thing
i
sure
the
supernatural
does
exist
christian
or
not
to
deny
it
is
to
deny
evidence
and
who
wants
to
be
a
materialist
one
of
these
silly
freethinkers
it
is
mighty
tiresome
to
be
vacillating
forever
how
i
envy
carhaix
his
robust
faith
you
do
want
much
said
des
hermies
faith
is
the
breakwater
of
the
soul
affording
the
only
haven
in
which
dismasted
man
can
glide
along
in
peace
chapter
xxii
you
like
that
asked
mme
carhaix
for
a
change
i
served
the
broth
yesterday
and
kept
the
beef
for
tonight
so
we
have
vermicelli
soup
a
salad
of
cold
meat
with
pickled
herring
and
celery
some
nice
mashed
potatoes
and
a
dessert
and
then
you
shall
taste
the
new
cider
we
just
got
oh
and
ah
exclaimed
des
hermies
and
durtal
who
while
waiting
for
dinner
were
sipping
the
elixir
of
life
do
you
know
mme
carhaix
your
cooking
tempts
us
to
the
sin
of
gluttony
if
you
keep
on
you
will
make
perfect
pigs
of
us
oh
you
are
joking
i
wonder
what
is
keeping
louis
somebody
is
coming
upstairs
said
durtal
hearing
the
creaking
of
shoes
in
the
tower
no
it
is
his
step
and
she
went
and
opened
the
door
monsieur
gévingey
and
indeed
clad
in
his
blue
cape
with
his
soft
black
hat
on
his
head
the
astrologer
entered
made
a
bow
like
an
actor
taking
a
curtain
call
nibbed
his
great
knuckles
against
his
massive
rings
and
asked
where
the
was
he
is
at
the
carpenter
the
oak
beams
holding
up
the
big
bell
are
cracked
and
louis
is
afraid
they
will
break
down
any
news
of
the
election
and
gévingey
took
out
his
pipe
and
filled
it
no
in
this
quarter
we
sha
know
the
results
until
nearly
ten
there
no
doubt
about
the
outcome
though
because
paris
is
strong
for
this
democratic
stuff
general
boulanger
will
win
hands
down
this
certainly
is
the
age
of
universal
imbecility
carhaix
entered
and
apologized
for
being
so
late
while
his
wife
brought
in
the
soup
he
took
off
his
goloshes
and
said
in
answer
to
his
questions
yes
the
dampness
had
rusted
the
frets
and
warped
the
beams
it
was
time
for
the
carpenter
to
intervene
he
finally
promised
that
he
would
be
here
tomorrow
and
bring
his
men
without
fail
well
i
am
mighty
glad
to
get
back
in
the
streets
everything
whirls
in
front
of
my
eyes
i
am
dizzy
i
do
know
what
to
do
the
only
places
where
i
am
at
home
are
the
belfry
and
this
room
here
wife
let
me
do
that
and
he
pushed
her
aside
and
began
to
stir
the
salad
how
good
it
smells
said
durtal
drinking
in
the
incisive
tang
of
the
herring
do
you
know
what
this
perfume
suggests
a
basket
funnelled
fireplace
twigs
of
juniper
snapping
in
it
in
a
room
opening
on
to
a
great
harbour
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
sort
of
salt
water
halo
around
these
little
rings
of
gold
and
rusted
exquisite
he
said
as
he
tasted
the
salad
we
make
it
again
for
you
monsieur
durtal
said
mme
carhaix
you
are
not
hard
to
please
alas
said
her
husband
his
palate
is
but
his
soul
is
when
i
think
of
his
despairing
aphorisms
of
the
other
night
however
we
are
praying
god
to
enlighten
him
i
tell
you
he
said
to
his
wife
we
will
invoke
saint
nolasque
and
saint
theodulus
who
are
always
represented
with
bells
they
sort
of
belong
to
the
family
and
they
will
certainly
be
glad
to
intercede
for
people
who
revere
them
and
their
emblems
it
would
take
a
stunning
miracle
to
convince
durtal
said
des
hermies
bells
have
been
known
to
perform
them
said
the
astrologer
i
remember
to
have
read
though
i
forget
where
that
angels
tolled
the
knell
when
saint
isidro
of
madrid
was
dying
and
there
are
many
other
cases
said
carhaix
of
their
own
accord
the
bells
chimed
when
saint
sigisbert
chanted
the
de
profundis
over
the
corpse
of
the
martyr
placidus
and
when
the
body
of
saint
ennemond
bishop
of
lyons
was
thrown
by
his
murderers
into
a
boat
without
oars
or
sails
the
bells
rang
out
though
nobody
set
them
in
motion
as
the
boat
passed
down
the
saône
do
you
know
what
i
think
asked
des
hermies
looking
at
carhaix
i
think
you
ought
to
prepare
a
compendium
of
hagiography
or
a
really
informative
work
on
heraldry
what
makes
you
think
that
well
you
are
thank
god
remote
from
this
epoch
and
fond
of
things
which
it
knows
nothing
about
or
execrates
and
a
work
of
that
kind
would
take
you
still
further
away
my
good
friend
you
are
the
man
forever
unintelligible
to
the
coming
generations
to
ring
bells
because
you
love
them
to
give
yourself
over
to
the
abandoned
study
of
feudal
art
or
monasticism
would
make
you
complete
take
you
clear
out
of
paris
out
of
the
world
back
into
the
middle
ages
alas
said
carhaix
i
am
only
a
poor
ignorant
man
but
the
type
you
speak
of
does
exist
in
switzerland
i
believe
a
has
for
years
been
collecting
material
for
a
heraldic
memorial
i
should
think
he
continued
laughing
that
his
avocation
would
interfere
with
his
vocation
and
do
you
think
said
gévingey
bitterly
that
the
profession
of
astrologer
is
less
decried
less
neglected
how
do
you
like
our
cider
asked
the
wife
do
you
find
it
a
bit
raw
no
it
tart
if
you
sip
it
but
sweet
if
you
take
a
good
mouthful
answered
durtal
wife
serve
the
potatoes
do
wait
for
me
i
delayed
so
long
getting
my
business
done
that
it
time
for
the
angelus
do
bother
about
me
go
on
eating
i
shall
catch
up
with
you
when
i
get
back
and
as
her
husband
lighted
his
lantern
and
left
the
room
the
woman
brought
in
on
a
plate
what
looked
to
be
a
cake
covered
with
golden
brown
caramel
icing
mashed
potatoes
i
thought
you
said
browned
in
the
oven
taste
it
i
put
in
everything
that
ought
to
make
it
very
good
all
exclaimed
over
it
then
it
became
impossible
to
hear
oneself
tonight
the
bell
boomed
out
with
unusual
clarity
and
power
durtal
tried
to
analyze
the
sound
which
seemed
to
rock
the
room
there
was
a
sort
of
flux
and
reflux
of
sound
first
the
formidable
shock
of
the
clapper
against
the
vase
then
a
sort
of
crushing
and
scattering
of
the
sounds
as
if
ground
fine
with
the
pestle
then
a
rounding
of
the
reverberation
then
the
recoil
of
the
clapper
adding
in
the
bronze
mortar
other
sonorous
vibrations
which
it
ground
up
and
cast
out
and
dispersed
through
the
sounding
shutters
then
the
bell
strokes
came
further
apart
now
there
was
only
the
whirring
as
of
a
spinning
wheel
a
few
crumbs
were
slow
about
falling
and
now
carhaix
returned
it
a
age
said
gévingey
pensive
people
believe
nothing
yet
gobble
everything
every
day
a
new
science
is
invented
nobody
reads
that
admirable
paracelsus
who
rediscovered
all
that
had
ever
been
found
and
created
everything
that
had
not
say
now
to
your
congress
of
scientists
that
according
to
this
great
master
life
is
a
drop
of
the
essence
of
the
stars
that
each
of
our
organs
corresponds
to
a
planet
and
depends
upon
it
that
we
are
in
consequence
a
foreshortening
of
the
divine
sphere
tell
them
and
this
experience
attests
that
every
man
born
under
the
sign
of
saturn
is
melancholy
and
pituitous
taciturn
and
solitary
poor
and
vain
that
that
sluggish
star
predisposes
to
superstition
and
fraud
directs
epilepsies
and
varices
hemorrhoids
and
leprosies
that
it
is
alas
the
great
purveyor
to
hospital
and
prison
and
the
scientists
will
shrug
their
shoulders
and
laugh
at
you
the
glorified
pedants
and
homiletic
asses
paracelsus
said
des
hermies
was
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
practitioners
of
occult
medicine
he
knew
the
now
forgotten
mysteries
of
the
blood
the
still
unknown
medical
effects
of
light
professing
as
did
also
the
cabalists
for
that
matter
that
the
human
being
is
composed
of
three
parts
a
material
body
a
soul
and
a
perispirit
called
also
an
astral
body
he
attended
this
last
especially
and
produced
reactions
on
the
carnal
envelope
by
procedures
which
are
either
incomprehensible
or
fallen
into
disuse
he
cared
for
wounds
by
treating
not
the
tissues
but
the
blood
which
came
out
of
them
however
we
are
assured
that
he
healed
certain
ailments
thanks
to
his
profound
knowledge
of
astrology
said
gévingey
but
if
the
study
of
the
sidereal
influence
is
so
important
said
durtal
why
do
you
take
pupils
i
ca
get
them
where
will
you
unearth
people
willing
to
study
twenty
years
without
glory
or
profit
because
to
be
able
to
establish
a
horoscope
one
must
be
an
astronomer
of
the
first
order
know
mathematics
from
top
to
bottom
and
one
must
have
put
in
long
hours
tussling
with
the
obscure
latin
of
the
old
masters
besides
you
must
have
the
vocation
and
the
faith
and
they
are
lost
just
the
way
it
is
with
bell
ringing
said
carhaix
no
you
see
messieurs
gévingey
went
on
the
day
when
the
grand
sciences
of
the
middle
ages
fell
foul
of
the
systematic
and
hostile
indifference
of
an
impious
people
was
the
of
the
soul
in
france
all
we
can
do
now
is
fold
our
arms
and
listen
to
the
wild
vagaries
of
society
which
by
turns
shrieks
with
farcical
joy
and
bitter
grief
we
must
not
despair
a
better
time
is
coming
said
mme
carhaix
in
a
conciliating
tone
and
before
she
retired
she
shook
hands
with
all
her
guests
the
people
said
des
hermies
pouring
the
water
into
the
instead
of
being
ameliorated
with
time
grow
from
century
to
century
more
avaricious
abject
and
stupid
remember
the
siege
the
commune
the
unreasonable
infatuations
the
tumultuous
hatreds
all
the
dementia
of
a
deteriorated
malnourished
people
in
arms
they
certainly
can
not
compare
with
the
naïf
and
plebes
of
the
middle
ages
tell
us
durtal
how
the
people
acted
when
gilles
de
rais
was
conducted
to
the
stake
yes
tell
us
said
carhaix
his
great
eyes
made
watery
by
the
smoke
of
his
pipe
well
you
know
as
a
consequence
of
crimes
the
marshal
de
rais
was
condemned
to
be
hanged
and
burned
alive
after
the
sentence
was
passed
when
he
was
brought
back
to
his
dungeon
he
addressed
a
last
appeal
to
the
bishop
jean
de
malestroit
beseeching
the
bishop
to
intercede
for
him
with
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
the
children
gilles
had
so
ferociously
violated
and
put
to
death
to
be
present
when
he
suffered
the
people
whose
hearts
he
had
lacerated
wept
with
pity
they
now
saw
in
this
demoniac
noble
only
a
poor
man
who
lamented
his
crimes
and
was
about
to
confront
the
divine
wrath
the
day
of
execution
by
nine
they
were
marching
through
the
city
in
processional
they
chanted
psalms
in
the
streets
and
took
vows
in
the
churches
to
fast
three
days
in
order
to
help
assure
the
repose
of
the
marshal
soul
pretty
far
as
you
see
from
american
lynch
law
said
des
hermies
then
resumed
durtal
at
eleven
they
went
to
the
prison
to
get
gilles
de
rais
and
accompanied
him
to
the
prairie
of
las
biesse
where
tall
stakes
stood
surmounted
by
gibbets
the
marshal
supported
his
accomplices
embraced
them
adjured
them
to
have
displeasure
and
contrition
of
their
ill
deeds
and
beating
his
breast
he
supplicated
the
virgin
to
spare
them
while
the
clergy
the
peasants
and
the
people
joined
in
the
psalmody
intoning
the
sinister
and
imploring
strophes
of
the
chant
for
the
departed
timemus
diem
judicii
quia
mali
et
nobis
conscii
sed
tu
mater
summi
concilii
para
nobis
locum
refugii
o
maria
iratus
judex
hurrah
for
boulanger
the
noise
as
of
a
stormy
sea
mounted
from
the
place
saint
sulpice
and
a
hubbub
of
cries
floated
up
to
the
tower
room
boulange
lange
then
an
enormous
raucous
voice
the
voice
of
an
oyster
woman
a
peddler
rose
dominating
all
others
howling
hurrah
for
boulanger
the
people
are
cheering
the
election
returns
in
front
of
the
city
hall
said
carhaix
disdainfully
they
looked
at
each
other
the
people
of
today
exclaimed
des
hermies
ah
grumbled
gévingey
they
would
acclaim
a
sage
an
artist
that
way
even
if
such
were
conceivable
now
a
saint
and
they
did
in
the
middle
ages
well
they
were
more
naïf
and
not
so
stupid
then
said
des
hermies
and
as
gévingey
says
where
now
are
the
saints
who
directed
them
you
can
not
too
often
repeat
it
the
spiritual
councillors
of
today
have
tainted
hearts
dysenteric
souls
and
slovenly
minds
or
they
are
worse
they
corrupt
their
flock
they
are
of
the
docre
order
and
satanize
to
think
that
a
century
of
positivism
and
atheism
has
been
able
to
overthrow
everything
but
satanism
and
it
can
not
make
satanism
yield
an
inch
easily
explained
cried
carhaix
satan
is
forgotten
by
the
great
majority
now
it
was
father
ravignan
i
believe
who
proved
that
the
wiliest
thing
the
devil
can
do
is
to
get
people
to
deny
his
existence
oh
god
murmured
durtal
forlornly
what
whirlwinds
of
ordure
i
see
on
the
horizon
no
said
carhaix
do
say
that
on
earth
all
is
dead
and
decomposed
but
in
heaven
ah
i
admit
that
the
paraclete
is
keeping
us
waiting
but
the
texts
announcing
his
coming
are
inspired
the
future
is
certain
there
will
be
light
and
with
bowed
head
he
prayed
fervently
des
hermies
rose
and
paced
the
room
all
that
is
very
well
he
groaned
but
this
century
laughs
the
glorified
christ
to
scorn
it
contaminates
the
supernatural
and
vomits
on
the
beyond
well
how
can
we
hope
that
in
the
future
the
offspring
of
the
fetid
tradesmen
of
today
will
be
decent
brought
up
as
they
are
what
will
they
do
in
life
they
will
do
replied
durtal
as
their
fathers
and
mothers
do
now
they
will
stuff
their
guts
and
crowd
out
their
souls
through
their
alimentary
canals
finis
