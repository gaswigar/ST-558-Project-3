as
well
as

but
th

lived
i
thinkin
said
old
bridget
mcgrady
to
her
neighbor
tierney
as
gilmore
passed
the
door
leading
her
girl
anna
by
the
hand
the
old
women
were
sitting
on
the
doorstep
as
the
worshipers
came
down
the
lane
from
early
mass
on
a
summer
morning
thrue
for
you
bridget
for
th
do
say
that
th
virgin
takes
all
sich
childther
before
they
ten
musha
but
gilmore
take
on
terrible
continued
tierney
but
th
will
of
god
must
be
done
anna
was
dressed
in
a
dainty
pink
dress
a
wide
blue
ribbon
kept
her
wealth
of
jet
black
hair
in
order
as
it
hung
down
her
back
and
the
squeaking
of
her
little
shoes
drew
attention
to
the
fact
that
they
were
new
and
in
the
fashion
it
a
mortal
pity
she
a
girl
said
bridget
bekase
she
might
hev
been
an
althar
boy
before
she
goes
aye
but
if
she
was
a
bhoy
shure
there
no
tellin
what
divilmint
she
get
into
so
maybe
it
just
as
well
the
gilmores
lived
on
a
small
farm
near
crumlin
in
county
antrim
they
were
not
considered
well
to
do
neither
were
they
poor
they
worked
hard
and
by
dint
of
economy
managed
to
keep
their
children
at
school
anna
was
a
favorite
child
her
quiet
demeanor
and
gentle
disposition
drew
to
her
many
considerations
denied
the
rest
of
the
family
she
was
a
favorite
in
the
community
by
the
old
women
she
was
considered
too
good
to
live
she
took
kindly
to
the
house
of
god
her
teacher
said
anna
has
a
great
head
for
learning
this
expression
oft
repeated
gave
the
gilmores
an
ambition
to
prepare
anna
for
teaching
despite
the
schedule
arranged
for
her
she
was
confirmed
in
the
parish
chapel
at
the
age
of
ten
at
fifteen
she
had
exhausted
the
educational
facilities
of
the
community
and
set
her
heart
on
institutions
of
higher
learning
in
the
larger
cities
while
her
parents
were
figuring
that
way
the
boys
of
the
parish
were
figuring
in
a
different
direction
before
anna
was
seventeen
there
was
scarcely
a
boy
living
within
miles
who
had
not
at
one
time
or
another
lingered
around
the
gate
of
the
gilmore
garden
gilmore
watched
anna
carefully
she
warned
her
against
the
danger
of
an
alliance
with
a
boy
of
a
lower
station
the
girl
was
devoted
to
the
church
she
knew
her
book
of
devotions
as
few
of
the
older
people
knew
it
and
before
she
was
twelve
she
had
read
the
lives
of
the
saints
none
of
these
things
made
her
an
ascetic
she
could
laugh
heartily
and
had
a
keen
sense
of
humor
the
old
women
revised
their
prophecies
they
now
spoke
of
her
th
veil
some
said
she
would
make
a
gey
good
schoolmisthress
for
she
was
fond
of
children
while
waiting
the
completion
of
arrangements
to
continue
her
schooling
she
helped
her
mother
with
the
household
work
she
spent
a
good
deal
of
her
time
too
in
helping
the
old
and
disabled
of
the
village
she
carried
water
to
them
from
the
village
well
and
tidied
up
their
cottages
at
least
once
a
week
the
village
well
was
the
point
of
departure
in
many
a
romance
there
the
boys
and
girls
met
several
times
a
day
many
a
boy
first
act
of
chivalry
was
to
take
the
girl
place
under
the
hoop
that
kept
the
cans
apart
and
carry
home
the
supply
of
water
half
a
century
after
the
incident
that
played
havoc
with
the
dreams
and
visions
of
which
she
was
the
central
figure
anna
said
to
me

he
an

he
walked
between

cans
at

mckinstry
doore
that
afthernoon
we
stood
till
the
shadows
began
t
fall
from
the
accounts
rendered
old
mary
did
not
lack
for
for
months
after
that
one
evening
mary
made
tea
for
the
and
after
tea
she
tossed
th
cups
for
them
here
two
roads
dear
she
said
to
anna
an
wan
day
ye

poverty

asked
plenty
ov
childther
on

clane

dogs
an
cats
on
th
road
t
good
livin
what
haave
ye
fur
me
mary
jamie
irvine
anna
friend
asked
she
took
his
cup
gave
it
a
shake
looked
wise
and
said
begorra
i
see
a
big
cup
me
bhoy
it
a
cup
o
grief
i
thinkin
it
is
oul
mary
was
jist
bletherin
he
said
as
they
walked
down
the
road
in
the
gloaming
hand
in
hand
a
cup
of
sorrow
is
so
bad
jamie
when
there
two
to
drink
it
anna
said
he
pressed
her
hand
tighter
and
replied
aye
that
thrue
fur
then
it
only
half
a
cup
jamie
was
a
shoemaker
apprentice
his
parents
were
very
poor
the
struggle
for
existence
left
time
for
nothing
else
as
the
children
reached
the
age
of
eight
or
nine
they
entered
the
struggle
jamie
began
when
he
was
eight
he
had
never
spent
a
day
at
school
his
family
considered
him
fortunate
however
that
he
could
be
an
apprentice
the
cup
that
old
mary
saw
in
the
tea
leaves
seemed
something
more
than
blether
when
it
was
noised
abroad
that
anna
and
jamie
were
to
be
married
the
gilmores
strenuously
objected
they
objected
because
they
had
another
career
mapped
out
for
anna
jamie
was
illiterate
too
and
she
was
well
educated
he
was
a
protestant
and
she
an
ardent
catholic
illiteracy
was
common
enough
and
might
be
overlooked
but
a
mixed
marriage
was
unthinkable
the
irvines
on
the
other
hand
although
very
poor
could
see
nothing
but
disaster
in
marriage
with
a
catholic
even
though
she
was
as
pure
and
beautiful
as
the
virgin
it
a
shame
an
a
scandal
others
said
that
a
young
fella
who
read
his
own
name
shud
marry
sich
a
nice
girl
wi
sich
larnin
jamie
made
some
defense
but
it
was
convincing
does
the
bible
say
maan
an
wife
are
wan
he
asked
gilmore
in
discussing
the
question
with
her
aye
well
when
anna
an
me
are
wan
wo
she
haave
a
thrade
an
wo
i
haave
an
education
that
wan
way
ov
lukin
at
a
vexed
question
but
you
th
only
wan
that
luks
at
it
that
way
there
two
anna
said
that
how
i
see
it
when
jamie
became
a
journeyman
shoemaker
the
priest
was
asked
to
perform
the
marriage
ceremony
he
refused
and
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
get
a
man
who
would
give
love
as
big
a
place
as
religion
and
they
were
married
by
the
vicar
of
the
parish
church
not
in
the
memory
of
man
in
that
community
had
a
wedding
created
so
little
interest
in
one
way
and
so
much
in
another
they
were
both
turncoats
the
people
said
and
they
were
shunned
by
both
sides
so
they
drank
their
first
big
draft
of
the
cup
o
grief
on
their
sufferin
will
be
yer
portion
in
this
world
anna
mother
told
her
an
in
th
world
t
come
separation
from
yer
maan
anna
kissed
her
mother
and
said
i
made
my
choice
mother
i
made
it
before
god
and
as
for
jamie
welfare
in
the
next
world
i
sure
that
love
like
his
would
turn
either
limbo
purgatory
or
hell
into
a
very
nice
place
to
live
in
a
few
days
after
the
wedding
the
young
couple
went
out
to
the
four
jamie
stood
his
staff
on
end
and
said
are
ye
ready
dear
aye
i
ready
but
do
tip
it
in
the
direction
of
your
preference
he
was
inclined
toward
dublin
she
toward
belfast
they
laughed
jamie
suddenly
took
his
hand
from
the
staff
and
it
fell
neither
toward
belfast
nor
dublin
but
toward
the
town
of
antrim
and
toward
antrim
they
set
out
on
foot
it
was
a
distance
of
less
than
ten
miles
but
it
was
the
longest
journey
she
ever
took
and
the
shortest
for
she
had
all
the
world
beside
her
and
so
had
jamie
it
was
in
june
and
they
had
all
the
time
there
was
there
was
no
hurry
they
were
as
as
children
and
utilized
their
freedom
in
full
between
moira
and
antrim
they
came
to
willie
withero
stone
pile
willie
was
antrim
most
noted
in
those
days
he
was
one
of
the
town
news
centers
at
his
he
got
the
news
going
and
coming
he
was
a
strange
mixture
of
philosophy
and
cynicism
he
had
a
rough
exterior
and
spoke
in
short
curt
snappish
sentences
but
behind
it
all
he
had
a
big
heart
full
of
kindly
human
feeling
anthrim
a
purty
good
place
fur
pigs

boots
there

what
will

he
adjusted
the
wire
protectors
to
his
eyes
and
the
sojourners
went
on
down
the
road
they
found
a
mossy
bank
and
unpacked
their
dinner
quare
is
he
jamie
said
he
has
more
sense
than
any
of
our
people
that
no
compliment
t
withero
anna
but
i
was
jist
thinkin
about
our
case
we
got
t
decide
somethin
an
we
might
as
well
decide
it
here
as
aanywhere
about
religion
jamie
aye
i
decided
when
at
the
ye
cud
be
withero
no
dear
willie
sees
only
half
th
world
there
love
in
it
bigger
than
color
of
ribbon
or
creed
of
church
we
proven
that
jamie
have
we
but
what
haave
ye
decided
that
love
is
bigger
than
religion
that
two
things
are
sure
one
is
love
of
god
he
loves
all
his
children
and
gets
huffed
at
none
the
other
is
that
the
love
we
have
for
each
other
is
of
the
same
warp
and
woof
as
his
for
us
and
is
jamie
aye
love
is
shure
enough
an
enough
as
good
as
a
faste
but
what
about
childther
if
th
come
anna
we
do
cross
a
stile
till
we
come
to
it
do
we
that
right
that
right
acushla
now
we
as
rich
as
lords
we
but
i
th
richest
am
i
i
got
you
an
you
only
got
me
i
got
book
learning
but
you
got
love
and
a
trade
what
more
do
i
want
you
got
more
love
than
any
man
that
ever
wooed
a
woman
so
richer
am
i
oh
god
jamie
said
but
is
this
th
lovely
world
eh
anna
within
a
mile
of
antrim
they
saw
a
cottage
perched
on
a
high
bluff
by
the
roadside
it
was
reached
by
stone
steps
they
climbed
the
steps
to
ask
for
a
drink
of
water
they
were
kindly
received
the
owner
was
a
follower
of
wesley
and
his
conversation
at
the
well
was
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
philosophy
at
the
the
young
journeyman
and
his
wife
were
profoundly
impressed
with
the
place
the
stone
cottage
was
there
were
beautiful
trees
and
a
garden
the
june
flowers
were
in
bloom
and
a
cow
grazed
in
the
pasture
near
by
some
day
we
haave
a
home
like
this
jamie
said
as
they
descended
the
steps
anna
named
it
the
mount
of
temptation
for
it
was
the
nearest
she
had
ever
been
to
the
sin
of
envy
a
crimean
pensioner
named
steele
occupied
it
during
my
youth
it
could
be
seen
from
pogue
entry
and
anna
used
to
point
it
out
and
tell
the
story
of
that
memorable
journey
in
days
when
clouds
were
heavy
and
low
and
the
gaunt
wolf
stood
at
the
door
she
would
say
do
you
mind
the
journey
to
antrim
jamie
aye
he
would
say
with
a
sigh
an
we
been
in
love
ever
since
have
we
anna
chapter
ii
the
wolf
and
the
carpenter
for
a
year
after
their
arrival
in
antrim
they
lived
in
the
home
of
the
for
whom
jamie
worked
as
journeyman
it
was
a
great
hardship
for
there
was
no
privacy
and
their
daily
walk
and
conversation
in
front
of
strangers
was
of
the
yea
yea
and
nay
nay
order
in
the
summer
time
they
spent
their
sundays
on
the
banks
of
lough
neagh
taking
whatever
food
they
needed
and
cooking
it
on
the
sand
they
continued
their
courting
in
that
way
they
watched
the
on
the
great
wide
marsh
they
waded
in
the
water
and
played
as
children
play
in
more
serious
moods
she
read
to
him
moore
poems
and
went
over
the
later
lessons
of
her
school
life
even
with
but
part
of
a
day
in
each
week
together
they
were
very
happy
the
world
was
full
of
sunshine
for
them
then
there
were
no
clouds
no
regrets
no
fears
it
was
a
period
a
brief
period
that
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
they
looked
back
upon
as
a
time
when
they
really
lived
i
am
not
sure
but
i
am
of
the
impression
that
the
chief
reason
she
could
not
be
persuaded
to
visit
the
lough
in
later
life
was
because
she
wanted
to
remember
it
as
she
had
seen
it
in
that
first
year
of
their
married
life
their
first
child
was
two
years
of
age
when
the
famine
came
the
famine
that
swept
over
ireland
like
a
plague
leaving
in
its
wake
over
a
million
graves
they
had
been
in
their
own
house
for
over
a
year
it
was
scantily
furnished
but
it
was
as
the
ravages
of
the
famine
spread
nearly
every
family
in
the
town
mourned
the
absence
of
some
member
men
and
women
met
on
the
street
one
day
were
gone
the
next
jamie
put
his
bench
to
one
side
and
sought
work
at
anything
he
could
get
to
do
prices
ran
up
beyond
the
possibilities
of
the
poor
the
potato
crop
only
failed
the
other
crops
were
reaped
and
the
proceeds
sent
to
england
as
rent
and
interest
and
the
reapers
having
sent
the
last
farthing
lay
down
with
their
wives
and
children
and
died
of
the
million
who
died
four
hundred
thousand
were
men
the
wolf
stood
at
every
door
the
carpenter
alone
was
busy
of
course
it
was
the
poor
who
died
the
poor
only
in
her
three
years
of
married
life
anna
realized
in
a
measure
that
the
future
held
little
change
for
her
or
her
husband
but
she
saw
a
ray
of
hope
for
the
boy
in
the
cradle
when
the
foodless
days
came
and
the
child
was
not
getting
food
enough
to
survive
she
gave
vent
to
her
feelings
of
despair
jamie
did
not
quite
understand
when
she
spoke
of
the
death
of
hope
spake
what
in
yer
heart
plainly
anna
he
said
plaintively
jamie
we
must
not
blame
each
other
for
anything
but
we
must
face
the
fact
we
live
at
the
bottom
of
the
world
where
every
hope
has
a
headstone
a
headstone
that
only
waits
for
the
name
aye
dear
god
help
us
i
know
i
know
what
ye
mane
above
and
beyond
us
she
continued
there
is
a
world
of
nice
things
books
furniture
pictures
a
world
where
people
and
things
can
be
kept
clean
but
it
a
world
we
could
never
reach
but
i
had
hope
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
was
silent
aye
aye
acushla
i
know
yer
hope
in
the
boy
but
do
give
up
we
fight
it
out
together
if
th
worst
comes
to
th
worst
the
live
shure
he
will
he
could
not
bear
the
agony
on
her
face
it
distracted
him
he
went
out
and
sought
solitude
on
a
pile
of
stones
back
of
the
house
there
was
no
solitude
there
nor
could
he
have
remained
long
if
there
had
been
he
returned
and
drawing
a
stool
up
close
beside
her
he
sat
down
and
put
an
arm
tenderly
over
her
shoulder
cheer
up
wee
girl
he
said
our
ship
comin
in
soon
if
we
can
only
save
him
she
said
pointing
to
the
cradle
well
we
wo
cry
over
spilt
milk
dear
not
at
laste
until
spilt
ah
she
exclaimed
i
had
such
hopes
for
him
aye
so
haave
i
but
thin
again
i
thought
t
myself

wee
fella

quality
like
wud
he
be
ashamed
ov
me
you
maybe
an
shure
an
ingrate
that
somethin
is
worse
than
nothin
a
child
born
in
pure
love
could
be
an
ingrate
jamie
that
possible
dear
ah
who
knows
what
a
chile
will
be
anna
the
child
awoke
and
began
to
cry
it
was
a
cry
for
food
there
was
nothing
in
the
house
there
had
been
nothing
all
that
day
they
looked
at
each
other
jamie
turned
away
his
face
he
arose
and
left
the
house
he
went
aimlessly
down
the
street
wondering
where
he
should
try
for
something
to
eat
for
the
child
there
were
several
old
friends
whom
he
supposed
were
in
the
same
predicament
but
to
whom
he
had
not
appealed
it
was
getting
to
be
an
old
story
a
score
of
as
good
children
as
his
had
been
buried
everybody
was
polite
full
of
sympathy
but
the
child
was
losing
his
vitality
so
was
the
mother
something
desperate
must
be
done
and
done
at
once
for
the
third
time
he
importuned
a
grocer
at
whose
shop
he
had
spent
much
money
the
grocer
was
just
putting
up
the
window
shutters
for
the
night
if
ye
cud
jist
spare
us
a
ov
milk
to
keep
th
life
in
chile

night
he
pleaded
it
wud

thimbleful
if

had
it
jamie
but
i
have
we
haave
childther
ov
our
own
ye
know
an
life

life
aye

he
said
i
know
i
know
and
shuffled
out
again
back
to
the
house
he
went
he
lifted
the
latch
gently
and
tiptoed
in
anna
was
rocking
the
child
to
sleep
he
went
softly
to
the
table
and
took
up
a
tin
can
and
turned
again
toward
the
door
anna
divined
his
stealthy
movement
she
was
beside
him
in
an
instant
where
are
you
going
jamie
he
hesitated
she
forced
an
answer
jamie
she
said
in
a
tone
new
to
her
there
been
nothing
but
truth
and
love
between
us
i
must
know
i
goin
out

that
can
to

it
that
what
in
my
mind
an
god
help
me
god

us
both
she
said
he
moved
toward
the
street
she
planted
herself
between
him
and
the
door
no
we
must
stand
together
they
put
you
in
jail
and
then
the
child
and
i
will
die
anyway
let
wait
another
day
they
sat
down
together
in
the
corner
it
was
dark
now
and
they
had
no
candle
the
last
handful
of
turf
was
on
the
fire
they
watched
the
sparks
play
and
the
fitful
spurts
of
flame
light
up
for
an
instant
at
a
time
the
darkened
home
it
was
a
picture
of
despair
the
first
of
a
long
series
that
ran
down
the
years
with
them
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
long
time
then
they
whispered
to
each
other
with
many
a
break
the
words
they
had
spoken
in
what
now
seemed
to
them
the
long
ago
the
fire
died
out
they
retired
but
not
to
sleep
they
were
too
hungry
there
was
an
insatiable
gnawing
at
their
vitals
that
made
sleep
impossible
it
was
like
a
cancer
with
excruciating
pain
added
sheer
exhaustion
only
stilled
the
cries
of
the
starving
child
there
were
no
more
tears
in
their
eyes
but
anguish
has
more
keen
poignant
and
subtle
in
agony
they
lay
in
silence
and
counted
time
by
the
repercussion
of
pain
until
the
welcome
dawn
came
with
its
new
supply
of
hope
the
scream
of
a
frenzied
mother
who
had
lost
a
child
in
the
night
was
the
prelude
to
a
tragic
day
anna
dressed
quickly
and
in
a
few
minutes
stood
by
the
side
of
the
woman
there
was
nothing
to
say
nothing
to
do
it
was
her
turn
it
would
be
anna
next
all
over
the
town
the
specter
hovered
every
day
the
reaper
garnered
a
new
harvest
of
human
sheaves
every
day
the
wolf
barked
every
day
the
carpenter
came
when
anna
returned
jamie
had
gone
she
took
her
station
by
the
child
jamie
took
the
tin
can
and
went
out
along
the
road
for
about
a
mile
and
entered
a
pasture
where
three
cows
were
grazing
he
was
weak
and
nervous
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
his
hands
trembled
he
had
never
milked
a
cow
he
had
no
idea
of
the
difficulty
involved
in
catching
a
cow
and
milking
her
in
a
pasture
there
was
the
milk
and
yonder
his
child
who
without
it
would
not
survive
the
day
desperation
dominated
and
directed
every
movement
the
cows
walked
away
as
he
approached
he
followed
he
drove
them
into
a
corner
of
the
field
and
managed
to
get
his
hand
on
one
he
tried
to
pet
her
but
the
jingling
of
the
can
frightened
her
and
off
they
went
all
of
them
on
a
fast
trot
along
the
side
of
the
field
he
became
cautious
as
he
cornered
them
a
second
time
this
time
he
succeeded
in
reaching
an
udder
he
got
a
tit
in
his
hand
he
lowered
himself
to
his
haunches
and
proceeded
to
tug
vigorously
his
hand
was
waxy
and
stuck
as
if
glued
to
the
flesh
before
there
was
any
sign
of
milk
the
cow
gave
him
a
swift
kick
that
sent
him
flat
on
his
back
by
the
time
he
pulled
himself
together
again
the
cows
were
galloping
to
the
other
end
of
the
pasture
god
he
muttered
as
he
mopped
the
sweat
from
his
face
with
his
sleeve
if
ye
got
aany
pity
or
kindly
feelin
giv
me
a
sup
ov
that
milk
fur
m
chile
come
on
his
legs
trembled
so
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
again
he
approached
the
cows
eyed
him
with
sullen
concern
they
were
thoroughly
scared
now
and
he
could
get
near
enough
to
lay
a
hand
on
any
of
them
he
stood
in
despair
trembling
from
head
to
foot
he
realized
that
what
he
would
do
he
must
do
quickly
the
morning
had
swift
wings
it
was
flying
away
some
one
would
be
out
for
the
cows
ere
long
and
his
last
chance
would
be
gone
he
dropped
the
can
and
ran
to
the
there
was
a
in
the
rear
he
entered
and
took
a
rope
from
a
stack
it
was
a
long
rope
too
long
for
his
use
but
he
did
not
want
to
destroy
its
usefulness
he
dragged
it
through
the
hedge
after
him
this
time
with
care
and
caution
he
got
near
enough
to
throw
the
rope
over
the
horns
of
a
cow
leading
her
to
a
fence
he
tied
her
to
it
and
began
again
it
came
slowly
his
strength
was
almost
gone
he
went
from
one
side
to
the
other
now
at
one
tit
now
at
another
from
his
haunches
he
went
to
his
knees
and
from
that
position
he
stretched
out
his
legs
and
sat
flat
on
the
grass
he
no
sooner
had
a
good
position
than
the
cow
would
change
hers
she
trampled
on
his
legs
and
swerved
from
side
to
side
but
he
held
on
it
was
a
life
and
death
struggle
the
little
milk
at
the
bottom
of
the
can
gave
him
strength
and
courage
as
he
literally
pulled
it
out
of
her
his
strength
increased
when
the
can
was
half
full
he
turned
the
cow
loose
and
made
for
the
gap
in
the
hedge
within
a
yard
of
it
he
heard
the
loud
report
of
a
gun
and
the
can
dropped
to
the
ground
the
ball
had
plowed
through
both
lugs
of
the
can
disconnecting
the
wire
handle
not
much
of
the
milk
was
lost
he
picked
up
the
can
and
started
down
the
road
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
take
him
he
had
only
gone
a
hundred
yards
when
a
man
stepped
out
into
the
road
and
leveled
a
gun
at
him
another
yard
an
i
blow
yer
brains
out
the
man
said

asked

jamie
put
the
can
down
on
the
road
and
stood
silent
the
farmer
delivered
himself
of
a
volume
of
profane
abuse
jamie
did
not
reply
he
stood
with
his
head
bowed
and
to
all
appearances
in
a
mood
of
penitence
when
the
man
finished
his
threats
and
abuse
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
can
before
his
hand
touched
it
jamie
sprang
at
him
with
the
ferocity
of
a
panther
there
was
a
life
and
death
tussle
for
a
few
seconds
and
both
men
went
down
on
the
road
jamie
on
top
sitting
on
the
man
chest
he
took
a
wrist
in
each
hand
and
pinned
him
to
the
ground

a
thief
he
said
to
the
man
as
he
looked
at
him
with
eyes

seized
the
gun
and
the
can
and
the
man
got
up
they
walked
down
the
road
in
silence
each
watching
the
other
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes

jamie
asked
abruptly
the
farmer
hesitated
before
answering
why

ask

like
t

a
maan
in
these
times
that
believed
wi
his
heart
insted
ov

but
he
be
kind
and
not
a
glutton
they
arrived
at
the
house
the
man
went
in
first
he
stopped
near
the
door
and
jamie
instinctively
and
in
fear
shot
past
him
what
he
saw
dazed
him
ah

he
exclaimed
she
dead
anna
lay
on
her
back
on
the
floor
and
the
boy
was
asleep
by
the
hearth
with
his
head
in
the
ashes
the
neighbors
were
alarmed
and
came
to
assist
the
farmer

anna
pulse
it
was
feebly
fluttering
she
not
dead
he
said

some
cold
wather
quickly
they
dashed
the
water
in
her
face
and
brought
her
back
to
consciousness
when
she
looked
around
she
said

drowsy
and
listless
they
gave
him

cup

also
the

born
a

months
after

was
broken
but
the
child
had
been
starved
in

womb
and
lived
only
three
months
there
was
no

wakes
are
for
older
people
there
were
no
candles
to
burn
no
extra

to
put
over
the
old
dresser
and
no
clock
to
stop
at
the
moment
of
death
the
little
wasted

lay
in

undressed
pine
coffin
on
the
table
and
the
neighbors
came
in
and
had
a
look

said
it
should
be
kept
the
allotted
time
and
the
tyrant
was
obeyed

was

aspects
of

had
the
changes
rung
on
them
anna
sat
in
the
corner
she
had
to
listen
she
had
to
answer
when
directly
addressed
and
the
prevailing
idea
of
politeness
made
her
the
center
of
every
story
and
the
object
of
every
moral
the
refreshments
were
all
distributed
and
diplomatically
the
mourners
were
informed
that
there
was
nothing
more
nevertheless
they
stayed
on
and
on
and
unstrung
anna
staggered
to

feet
and
took

she
had
gone

while
the
dead
child
lay
there
withero
had
been
at

and
was

at

explained

smoked
for

then
he
went
over
to
the
little
coffin
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his

laid
it
on

she
was

jamie
and
withero
kept
the
vigil
with
the
door
barred
next
morning
at
the
earliest
respectable
hour
withero
carried
the
little
coffin
under
his
arm
and
jamie
walked
beside
him
to
the
graveyard
during
the
fifteen
years
that
followed
the
burial
of
the
famine
child
they
buried
three
others
and
saved
three
four
living
and
four
dead
i
was
the
ninth
child
anna
gave
me
a
greek
name
which
means
helper
of
men
shortly
after
my
arrival
in
scott
entry
they
moved
to
pogue
entry
the
stone
cabin
was
and
measured
about
twelve
by
sixteen
feet
the
space
comprised
three
apartments
one
a
bedroom
over
the
bedroom
and
beneath
the
thatch
a
little
loft
that
served
as
a
bedroom
to
those
of
climbing
age
the
rest
of
it
was
workshop
parlor
and
general
community
news
center
the
old
folks
slept
in
a
bed
the
rest
of
us
slept
on
the
floor
and
beneath
the
thatch
between
the
bedroom
door
and
the
open
fireplace
was
the
near
the
door
stood
an
old
pine
table
and
some
dressers
they
stood
against
the
wall
and
were
filled
with
crockery
we
never
owned
a
chair
there
were
several
pine
stools
a
few
creepies
small
stools
and
a
long
bench
that
ran
along
the
bedroom
wall
from
the
chimney
corner
to
the
bedroom
door
the
mud
floor
never
had
the
luxury
of
a
covering
nor
did
a
picture
ever
adorn
the
bare
walls
when
the
floor
needed
patching
jamie
went
to
somebody
garden
brought
a
shovelful
of
earth
mixed
it
and
filled
the
holes
the
stools
and
creepies
were
scrubbed
once
a
week
the
table
once
a
day
i
could
draw
an
outline
of
that
old
table
now
and
accurately
mark
every
dent
and
crack
in
it
i
do
not
know
where
it
came
from
but
each
of
us
had
a
that
one
day
we
should
possess
a
pig
we
built
around
the
hope
a
sty
and
placed
it
against
the
end
of
the
cabin
the
pig
never
turned
up
but
the
hope
lived
there
throughout
a
generation
we
owned
a
goat
once
in
three
months
it
reduced
the
smooth
kindly
feeling
in
pogue
entry
to
the
point
of
total
eclipse
we
sold
it
and
spent
a
year
in
winning
back
old
friends
we
had
a
garden
it
measured
by
sixteen
inches
and
was
just
outside
the
front
window
at
one
end
was
a
small
currant
bush
and
in
the
rest
of
the
space
anna
grew
an
annual
crop
of
nasturtiums
once
we
were
prosperous
that
was
when
two
older
brothers
worked
with
my
father
at
shoemaking
i
remember
them
on
winter
nights
sitting
around
the
big
candlestick
one
of
the
three
always
singing
as
he
worked
as
they
worked
near
the
window
anna
sat
in
her
corner
and
by
the
light
of
a
candle
in
her
little
sconce
made
waxed
ends
for
the
men
i
browsed
among
the
lasts
clipping
cutting
and
scratching
old
leather
parings
and
dreaming
of
the
wonderful
days
beyond
when
i
too
could
make
a
boot
and
sing
susan
then
the
news
came
news
of
a
revolution
they
making
boots
by
machinery
now
anna
said
one
day
it
dotin
ye
are
anna
jamie
replied
she
read
the
account
how
cud
a
machine
make
a
boot
anna
he
asked
in
bewilderment
i
do
know
dear
barney
mcquillan
was
the
village
authority
on
such
things
when
he
told
jamie
he
looked
aghast
and
said
how
quare
then
makers
became
menders
shoemakers
became
cobblers
there
was
something
of
magic
and
romance
in
the
news
that
a
machine
could
turn
out
as
much
work
as
men
but
when
my
brothers
moved
away
to
other
parts
of
the
world
to
find
work
the
romance
was
rubbed
off
maybe
we
can
get
a
machine
jamie
said
aye
but
shure
ye
have
to
get
a
factory
to
put
it
in
is
that
so
aye
an
we
find
it
hard
enough
t
pay
fur
what
we
in
now
barney
mcquillan
was
the
in
our
town
who
was
best
able
to
readjust
himself
to
changed
conditions
he
became
a
and
doled
out
what
he
took
in
to
men
like
jamie
he
kept
a
dozen
men
at
work
making
a
little
off
each
just
as
the
owner
of
the
machine
did
in
the
factory
in
each
case
the
need
of
skill
vanished
and
the
power
of
capital
advanced
jamie
dumbly
took
what
was
left
cobbling
for
barney
to
anna
the
whole
thing
meant
merely
the
death
of
a
few
more
hopes
for
over
twenty
years
she
had
fought
a
good
fight
a
fight
in
which
she
played
a
losing
part
though
she
was
never
wholly
defeated
her
first
fight
was
against
slang
and
slovenly
speech
she
started
early
in
their
married
life
to
correct
jamie
he
tried
hard
and
often
but
he
found
it
difficult
to
speak
one
language
to
his
wife
and
another
to
his
customers
from
the
lips
of
anna
it
sounded
all
right
but
the
same
pronunciation
by
jamie
seemed
affected
and
his
customers
gaped
at
him
then
she
directed
her
efforts
anew
to
the
children
one
after
another
she
corrected
their
grammar
and
pronunciation
corrected
them
every
day
and
every
hour
of
the
day
that
they
were
in
her
presence
here
again
she
was
doomed
to
failure
the
children
lived
on
the
street
and
spoke
its
language
it
seemed
a
hopeless
task
she
never
whined
over
it
she
was
too
busy
cleaning
cooking
sewing
and
at
odd
times
helping
jamie
but
night
after
night
for
nearly
a
generation
she
took
stock
of
a
effort
and
each
milestone
on
the
way
spelt
failure
she
could
see
no
light
not
a
glimmer
not
only
had
she
failed
to
impress
her
language
upon
others
but
she
found
herself
gradually
succumbing
to
her
environment
and
actually
lapsing
into
vulgar
forms
herself
there
was
a
larger
and
more
vital
conflict
than
the
one
she
had
lost
it
was
the
fight
against
dirt
in
such
small
quarters
with
so
many
children
and
such
activity
in
work
she
fought
against
great
odds
bathing
facilities
were
almost
impossible
water
had
to
be
brought
from
the
town
well
except
what
fell
on
the
roof
and
that
was
saved
for
washing
clothes
whatever
bathing
there
was
was
done
in
the
tub
in
which
jamie
steeped
his
leather
we
children
were
suspicious
that
when
jamie
bathed
anna
had
a
hand
in
it
they
had
a
joke
between
them
that
could
only
be
explained
on
that
basis
she
called
it
grooming
the
elephant
jist
wait
m
boy
she
would
say
in
a
spirit
of
kindly
banter
till
the
elephant
has
to
be
groomed
and
i
bring
ye
down
a
peg
or
two
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
among
them
as
to
the
training
of
children
no
chile
iver
thrived
on
saft
words
he
said
a
wet
welt
is
betther
aye
yer
wet
welt
stings
th
flesh
jamie
but
it
niver
gets
at
a
chile
mind
thrue
for
you
but
who
th
kin
get
at
a
chile
mind
one
day
i
was
chased
into
the
house
by
a
bigger
boy
i
had
found
a
farthing
he
said
it
was
his
the
money
was
handed
over
and
the
boy
left
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
i
was
ordered
to
strip
when
ready
he
laid
me
across
his
knee
and
applied
the
wet
welt
an
hour
later
it
was
discovered
that
a
week
had
elapsed
between
the
losing
and
finding
of
the
farthing
no
sane
person
would
believe
that
a
farthing
could
lie
for
a
whole
week
on
the
streets
of
antrim
well
he
said
ye
need
a
warmin
like
that
ivery
day
an
ye
had
nown
yestherday
did
ye
on
another
occasion
i
found
a
ball
one
that
had
never
been
lost
a
boy
hoping
to
get
me
in
front
of
my
father
claimed
the
ball
my
mother
on
this
occasion
sat
in
judgment
where
did
get
the
ball
she
asked
the
boy
he
could
remember
she
probed
for
the
truth
but
neither
of
us
would
give
in
when
all
efforts
failed
she
cut
the
ball
in
half
and
gave
each
a
piece
nixt
time
i
tell
yer
dah
the
boy
said
when
he
got
outside
he
makes
you
squeal
like
a
pig
when
times
were
good
when
work
and
wages
got
a
little
ahead
of
hunger
which
was
seldom
anna
baked
her
own
bread
three
kinds
of
bread
she
baked
soda
common
flour
bread
never
in
the
shape
of
a
loaf
but
bread
that
lay
flat
on
the
griddle
pirta
oaten
made
of
flour
and
oatmeal
and
fadge
potato
bread
she
always
sung
while
baking
and
she
sang
the
most
melancholy
and
plaintive
airs
as
she
baked
and
sang
i
stood
beside
her
on
a
creepie
watching
the
process
and
awaiting
the
end
for
at
the
close
of
each
batch
of
bread
i
always
had
my
duragh
an
extra
piece
when
hunger
got
ahead
of
wages
the
family
bread
was
bought
at
sam
johnson
bakery
the
journey
to
sam
was
full
of
temptation
to
me
hungry
and
with
a
vested
interest
in
the
loaf
on
my
arm
i
was
not
over
punctilious
in
details
of
the
moral
law
anna
pointed
out
the
opportunities
of
such
a
journey
it
was
a
chance
to
try
my
mettle
with
the
arch
tempter
it
was
a
mental
gymnasium
in
which
moral
muscle
got
strength
there
was
in
all
ireland
a
mile
of
highway
so
well
paved
with
good
intentions
i
used
to
start
out
well
keyed
up
morally
and
humming
over
and
over
the
order
of
the
day
when
on
the
home
stretch
i
had
made
a
dent
in
sam
architecture
i
would
lay
the
loaf
down
on
the
table
good
side
toward
my
mother
while
i
was
doing
that
she
had
read
the
story
of
the
fall
on
my
face
i
could
feel
her
penetrating
gaze
so
he
got
ye
did
he
aye
i
would
say
in
a
voice
too
low
to
be
heard
by
my
father
the
order
at
sam
was
usually
a
sixpenny
loaf
three
worth
of
tea
and
sugar
and
half
an
ounce
of
tobacco
there
were
times
when
barney
had
no
work
for
my
father
and
on
such
occasions
i
came
home
then
jamie
would
go
out
to
find
work
as
a
day
laborer
periods
like
these
were
glossed
over
by
anna
humor
and
wit
as
they
sat
around
the
table
eating
without
milk
or
bread
without
tea
jamie
would
grunt
and
complain
aye
faith
anna
would
say
it
purty
bad
but
it
worse
where
there
none
at
all
when
the
wolf
lingered
long
at
the
door
i
went
foraging
foraging
as
forages
a
hungry
dog
and
in
the
same
places
around
the
hovels
of
the
poor
where
dogs
have
clean
teeth
a
boy
has
little
chance
one
day
having
exhausted
the
ordinary
channels
of
relief
without
success
i
betook
myself
to
the
old
on
the
mill
race
the
boys
had
a
custom
of
taking
a
shiverin
bite
when
they
went
bathing
it
was
on
a
sunday
afternoon
in
july
and
quite
a
crowd
sat
around
the
hole
i
neither
needed
nor
wanted
a
bath
i
wanted
a
bite
no
one
offered
a
share
of
his
crust
a
big
boy
named
healy
was
telling
of
his
prowess
as
a
fighter
i
fight
ye
fur
a
penny
said
i
where
yer
penny
said
healy
i
get
it
th
morra
a
man
seeing
the
difficulty
and
willing
to
invest
in
a
scrap
advanced
the
wager
i
was
utterly
outclassed
and
beaten
peeling
my
clothes
off
i
went
into
the
race
for
a
swim
and
to
wash
the
blood
off
when
i
came
out
healy
had
hidden
my
trousers
i
searched
for
hours
in
vain
the
man
who
paid
the
wager
gave
me
an
extra
penny
and
i
went
home
holding
my
jacket
in
front
of
my
legs
the
penny
saved
me
from
a
warming
but
anna
feeling
that
some
extra
discipline
was
necessary
made
me
a
pair
of
trousers
out
of
an
old
potato
sack
that
sackcloth
dear
she
said
an
ye
can
aither
sit
in
th
ashes
in
them
or
wear
them
in
earning
another
pair
hold
fast
t
yer
penny
in
this
penitential
outfit
i
had
to
sell
my
papers
every
fiber
of
my
being
tingled
with
shame
and
humiliation
i
did
complain
of
the
penance
but
i
swore
vengeance
on
healy
she
worked
the
desire
for
vengeance
out
of
my
system
in
her
by
reading
to
me
often
enough
so
that
i
memorized
the
chapter
of
isaiah
miss
mcgee
the
postmistress
gave
me
sixpence
for
the
accomplishment
and
that
went
toward
a
new
pair
of
trousers
concerning
healy
anna
said
bate
with
a
betther
brain
dear
despite
my
fistic
encounters
my
dents
in
the
family
loaves
my
shinny
my
marbles
and
the
various
signs
of
total
or
at
least
partial
depravity
anna
clung
to
the
hope
that
out
of
this
thing
might
finally
come
what
she
was
looking
praying
and
hoping
for
an
item
on
the
credit
side
of
my
ledger
was
that
i
was
born
in
a
caul
a
thin
filmy
veil
that
covered
me
at
birth
of
her
twelve
i
was
the
only
one
born
in
luck
in
a
little
purse
she
kept
the
caul
and
on
special
occasions
she
would
exhibit
it
and
enumerate
the
benefits
and
privileges
that
went
with
it
persons
born
in
a
caul
were
immune
from
being
hung
drawn
and
quartered
burned
to
death
or
lost
at
sea
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
caul
i
was
rented
to
old
mary
mcdonagh
my
duty
was
to
meet
her
every
monday
morning
the
meeting
insured
her
luck
for
the
week
mary
was
a
huckster
she
carried
her
shop
on
her
arm
a
wicker
basket
in
which
she
had
thread
needles
ribbons
and
other
things
which
she
sold
to
the
farmers
and
folks
away
from
the
shopping
center
no
one
is
lucky
while
having
no
shoes
i
clattered
down
sandy
somerville
entry
in
my
father
at
the
first
clatter
she
came
out
basket
on
arm
and
said
morra
bhoy
god
blessin
on
ye
morra
mary
an
good
luck
t
ye
was
my
answer
i
used
to
express
my
wonder
that
i
could
turn
this
luck
of
a
variety
into
a
pair
of
shoes
for
myself
anna
said
yer
luck
dear
is
in
what
ye
can
get
but
in
what
ye
can
give
when
antrim
opened
its
first
flower
show
i
was
a
boy
of
all
work
at
old
chaine
the
gardener
was
pleased
with
my
work
and
gave
me
a
hothouse
plant
to
put
in
competition
i
carried
it
home
proudly
and
laid
it
down
beside
her
in
the
the
says
it
bate
th
brains
out
on
aany
geranium
in
the
show
i
said
throth
it
will
that
dear
she
said
but
sure
ye
could
take
a
prize
fur
it
why
i
growled
ah
honey
shure
everybody
would
know
that
ye
did
grow
it
forby
they
know
that
th
smoke
in
here
would
kill
it
in
a
few
days
i
sulked
and
protested
that
a
nice
way
t
throw
cowld
wather
on
th
chile
jamie
said
why
do
ye
let
go
on
an
take
his
chances
at
the
show
a
pained
look
overspread
her
features
it
was
as
if
he
had
struck
her
with
his
fist
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
said
huskily
the
whole
world
a
show
jamie
an
this
is
the
only
place
the
wee
fella
has
to
rehearse
in
i
sat
down
beside
her
and
laid
my
head
in
her
lap
she
stroked
it
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
i
could
quite
see
however
how
i
could
miss
that
show
she
saw
that
after
all
i
was
determined
to
enter
the
lists
she
offered
to
put
a
card
on
it
for
me
so
that
they
would
know
the
name
of
the
owner
this
is
what
she
wrote
on
the
card
this
plant
is
lent
for
decorative
purposes
that
night
there
was
an
unusual
atmosphere
in
her
corner
she
had
a
newly
tallied
cap
on
her
head
and
her
little
sunday
shawl
over
her
shoulders
her
candle
was
burning
and
the
hearthstones
had
an
extra
coat
of
whitewash
she
drew
me
up
close
beside
her
and
told
me
a
story
once
a
long
long
time
ago

wild
places
near
antrim
gathering
the
flowers
of
the
poor
my
mother
arranged

in
a
novel
bouquet
a
bouquet
of
wild
flowers
the
base
of
it
yellow
primroses
the
apex
of
pink
shepherd
sundials
and
between

base
and
the
apex
one
of
the
greatest
variety
of
wild
flowers
ever
gotten
together
in
that
part
of
the
world
it
created
a
sensation
and
took
first
prize
at
the
close
of
the
exhibition
james
chaine
distributed
the
prizes
when
my
name
was
called
i
went
forward
slowly
blushing
in
my
rags
and
received
a
piece
set
of
china
it
gave
me
a
fit
i
took
it
home
put
it
in
her
lap
and
danced
we
held
open
house
for
a
week
so
that
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
community
could
come
in
and
handle
it
withero
said
we
ought
to
save
up
and
build
a
house
to
keep
it
in
she
thought
that
a
propitious
time
to
explain
the
inscription
she
put
on
the
card
ah
thin
i
said

nice
chapter
iv
sunday
in
pogue
entry
jamie
and
anna
kept
the
sabbath
it
was
a
habit
with
them
and
the
children
got
it
one
after
another
as
they
came
along
when
the
town
clock
struck
twelve
on
saturday
night
the
week
work
was
done
the
customers
were
given
fair
warning
that
at
the
hour
of
midnight
the
bench
would
be
put
away
until
monday
morning
there
was
nothing
theological
about
the
observance
it
was
a
custom
not
a
code
anna
looked
upon
it
as
an
notion
more
than
once
she
was
heard
to
say
the
sabbath
was
made
for
maan
jamie
and
not
maan
for
th
sabbath
his
answer
had
brevity
and
point
i
do
care
a
damn
what
it
was
made
for
anna
i
quit
at
twelve
and
he
quit
sometimes
anna
would
take
an
unfinished
job
and
finish
it
herself
there
were
things
in
cobbling
she
could
do
as
well
as
jamie
her
defense
of
doing
it
in
the
early
hours
of
the
sabbath
was
sure
god
has
more
important
work
to
do
than
to
sit
up
late
to
watch
us
mend
the
boots
of
the
poor
forby
it
better
to
haave
ye
boots
mended
an
go
to
church
than
to
sit
in
th
ashes
on
sunday
an
swallow
the
smoke
of
bad
turf
aye
jamie
would
say
it
jist
wondtherful
what
we
can
do
if
we
haave
th
right
kind
ov
a
conscience
jamie
first
duty
on
sunday
was
to
clean
out
the
thrush
cage
he
was
very
proud
of
dicky
and
gave
him
a
bath
every
morning
and
a
house
cleaning
on
sunday
we
children
loved
sunday
on
that
day
anna
reigned
she
wore
her
little
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
her
hair
was
enclosed
in
a
newly
tallied
white
cap
she
smoked
little
but
on
sundays
after
dinner
she
always
had
her
dhraw
with
jamie
anna
sunday
chore
was
to
whitewash
the
hearthstones
and
clean
the
house
when
the
table
was
laid
for
sunday
breakfast
and
the
kettle
hung
on
the
chain
singing
and
anna
was
in
her
glory
of
white
linen
the
children
were
supremely
happy
in
their
wildest
dreams
there
was
nothing
quite
as
beautiful
as
that
whatever
hunger
disappointment
or
petty
quarrel
happened
during
the
week
it
was
forgotten
on
sunday
it
was
a
day
of
supreme
peace
sunday
breakfast
was
what
she
called
a
puttiby
something
light
to
tide
them
over
until
dinner
time
dinner
was
the
big
meal
of
the
week
at
every
meal
i
sat
beside
my
mother
if
we
had
i
was
favored
but
not
enough
to
arouse
jealousy
i
scraped
the
pot
if
it
was
tay
i
got
a
few
bits
of
the
crust
of
anna
bread
we
called
it
scroof
about
ten
the
preparations
for
the
big
dinner
began
we
had
meat
once
a
week
at
least
it
was
the
plan
to
have
it
so
often
of
course
there
were
times
when
the
plan
did
work
but
when
it
did
sunday
was
meat
day
the
word
meat
was
never
used
it
was
kitchen
or
beef
both
words
meant
the
same
thing
and
bacon
might
be
meant
by
either
of
them
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
sunday
kitchen
was
a
cow
head
a
head
and
pluck
a
pair
of
cow
feet
a
few
sheep
trotters
or
a
quart
of
sheep
blood
sometimes
it
was
the
entrails
of
a
pig
only
when
there
was
no
money
for
kitchen
did
we
have
blood
it
was
at
first
fried
and
then
made
part
of
the
broth
the
on
sunday
was
the
center
the
economic
status
of
a
family
could
be
as
easily
gaged
by
tasting
their
broth
as
by
counting
the
weekly
income
big
money
good
broth
little
money
thin
broth
the
slimmer
the
resource
the
fewer
the
ingredients
the
pot
was
an
index
to
every
condition
and
the
talisman
of
every
family
it
was
an
opportunity
to
show
off
when
jamie
donned
a
dickey
once
to
attend
a
funeral
and
came
home
with
it
in
his
pocket
no
comment
was
made
but
if
anna
made
poor
broth
it
was
the
talk
of
the
entry
for
a
week
good
broth
consisted
of
kitchen
barley
greens
and
lithing
next
to
kitchen
barley
was
the
most
expensive
ingredient
folks
in
entry
did
always
have
it
but
there
were
a
number
of
cheap
substitutes
such
as
hard
peas
or
horse
beans
amongst
half
a
dozen
families
in
and
around
the
entry
there
was
a
broth
exchange
each
family
made
a
few
extra
quarts
and
exchanged
them
they
were
distributed
in
quart
tin
cans
each
can
was
emptied
washed
refilled
and
returned
ann
the
chimneysweep
wife
was
usually
first
on
hand
she
had
the
unenviable
reputation
of
being
the
dhirtiest
craither
in
the
community

number
of
times
while

listened
then
came
the
weekly
function
over
which
there
invariably
arose
an
altercation
amongst
the
children
it
was
the
sunday
visit
of
the
methodist
tract
distributor
miss
clarke
it
was
not
an
unmixed
dread
for
sometimes
she
brought
a
good
story
and
the
family
enjoyed
it
the
usual
row
took
place
as
to
who
should
go
to
the
door
and
return
the
tract

was
finally
decided
that

feet

my

it
down

miles
of

the
lady
saw
an
opening
and
went
in
did
you
ever
get
caught
she
asked
i
hung
my
head
then
followed
a
brief
lecture
on
private
property
brief
for
it
was
cut
short
by
anna
who
without
any
apology
or
introduction
said
as
she
confronted
the
slum
evangel
is
god
our
father
yes

was
a
commotion
behind
the
paper
partition
the
group
stood
in
breathless
silence
until
the
hunger
question
was
put
then
they
dunched
each
other
and
made
faces
my
father
took
a
handful
of
my
hair
and
gave
it
a
but
vigorous
tug
to
prevent
an
explosion

the

but
before

found
the
passage

was
reading
from
her
old
yellow
backless
bible
about
the
birds
that

the
branches
of

the
lady
was
and
full
of
sympathy
but
she
traveled
along
the
same
road
as
anna
and
did
know
behind
the
screen
the
group
was
jubilant
but
when
they
saw
the
sympathy
on

tract

they
sobered
and
looked
sad
i
must

she
said
and

and
anna
replied

kindly

when
anna
went
behind

screen
jamie
grabbed
her
and
pressed
her
closely
to
him

any

saucer
then
she
took
it
up
and
examined

quizzically
the
leaves
straggled
hieroglyphically
over

swappin
stories

sunday

ever
the
day

romance
anna

best
broth
and

best
stories
no
sunday
was
complete
without
a
good
story
on
the
doorstep
that
night
she
told
one
of
her
best
as
she
finished
the
church
bell
tolled
the
curfew
then
the
days
of
the
month
were
tolled
off
sammy
arm
is
gey
shtrong
th
night
willie
said
aye
jamie
said
an
th
oul
bell
got
a
fine
ring
chapter
v
his
arm
is
not
shortened
when
anna
had
to
choose
between
love
and
religion
the
religion
of
an
institution
she
chose
love
her
faith
in
god
remained
unshaken
but
her
methods
of
approach
were
the
forms
of
love
rather
than
the
symbols
or
ceremonies
of
a
sect
twelve
times
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
she
appeared
publicly
in
the
parish
church
each
time
it
was
to
lay
on
the
altar
of
religion
the
fruit
of
her
love
of
those
twelve
congregations
would
not
have
known
her
if
they
had
met
her
on
the
street
were
those
who
occupied
the
charity
pews
religion
in
our
town
had
arrayed
the
inhabitants
into
two
hostile
camps
she
never
had
any
sympathy
with
the
fight
she
was
neutral
she
pointed
out
to
the
fanatics
around
her
that
the
basis
of
religion
was
love
and
that
religion
that
expressed
itself
in
faction
fights
must
have
hate
at
the
bottom
of
it
not
love
she
had
a
philosophy
of
religion
that
to
the
sects
it
would
have
been
rank
heresy
but
the
sects
did
know
she
existed
and
those
who
were
benefited
by
her
quaint
and
unique
application
of
religion
to
life
were
almost
as
obscure
as
she
was
i
was
the
first
to
discover
her
heresy
and
oppose
it
she
lived
to
see
me
repent
of
my
folly
in
a
town
of
two
thousand
people
less
than
two
hundred
were
familiar
with
her
face
and
half
of
them
knew
her
because
at
one
time
or
another
they
had
been
to
jamie
to
have
their
shoes
made
or
mended
or
because
they
lived
in
our
immediate
vicinity
of
the
hundred
who
knew
her
face
less
than
half
of
them
were
familiar
enough
to
call
her
anna
of
all
the
people
who
had
lived
in
antrim
as
long
as
she
had
she
was
the
least
known
no
feast
or
function
could
budge
her
out
of
her
corner
there
came
a
time
when
her
family
became
as
accustomed
to
her
refusal
as
she
had
to
her
environment
and
we
ceased
to
coax
or
urge
her
she
never
attended
a
picnic
a
soirée
or
a
dance
in
antrim
one
big
opportunity
for
social
intercourse
amongst
the
poor
is
a
wake
she
never
attended
a
wake
she
often
took
entire
charge
of
a
wake
for
a
neighbor
but
she
directed
the
affair
from
her
corner
she
had
a
slim
sort
of
acquaintance
with
three
intellectual
men
they
were
john
galt
william
green
and
john
gordon
holmes
vicars
in
that
order
of
the
parish
of
antrim
they
visited
her
once
a
year
and
at
funerals
the
funerals
of
her
own
dead
none
of
them
knew
her
they
had
time
but
there
were
members
of
our
own
family
who
knew
as
little
of
her
mind
as
they
did
she
did
not
seek
obscurity
it
seemed
to
have
sought
and
found
her
one
avenue
of
escape
after
another
was
closed
and
she
settled
down
at
last
to
her
lot
in
the
her
hopes
beliefs
and
aspirations
were
expressed
in
what
she
did
rather
than
in
what
she
said
though
she
said
much
much
that
is
still
treasured
long
after
she
has
passed
away
henry
lecky

a
young

an
th
only

henry
cud
enjoy
it
the
candles
were
burned
low
in
the
sconces
the
flowers
around
the
corpse
had
faded
a
few
tongues
loosened
by
stimulation
were
still
wagging
but
the
laughter
had
died
down
and
the
stories
were
all
told
there
had
been
a
ghost
story
that
had
sent
a
dozen
home
before
the
time
of
departure
the
empty
stools
had
been
carried
outside
and
were
largely
occupied
by
lovers
anna
drew
eliza
head
to
her
breast
and
pressing
it
gently
to
her
said
i
proud
of

few
winks
in

corner
for
there
be
much
to
do
th
morra
scarcely
had
the
words
died
on
her
lips
when
kitty
coyle
gave
vent
to
a
scream
of
terror
that
brought
the
mourners
to
the
door
and
terrified
those
outside
what
ails
ye
in
th
name
of
god
anna
asked
she
was
too
terrified
to
speak
at
once
the
mourners
crowded
closely
together
watch
kitty
said
as
she
pointed
with
her
finger
toward
pigsty
johnny
murdock
had
his
arm
around
kitty
waist
to
keep
her
steady
and
assure
her
of
protection
they
watched
and
waited
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
and
save
for
the
deep
shadows
of
the
houses
and
hedges
as
clear
as
day
tensely
and
stood
the
group
for
what
seemed
to
them
hours
in
a
few
minutes
a
white
figure
was
seen
emerging
from
the
pigsty
the
watchers
were
transfixed
in
terror
most
of
them
clutched
at
each
other
nervously
old
houston
the
midwife
who
had
told
the
ghost
story
at
the
wake
dropped
in
a
heap
peter
hannen
and
jamie
wilson
carried
her
indoors
the
white
figure
stood
on
the
pathway
leading
through
the
gardens
for
a
moment
and
then
returned
to
the
sty
most
of
the
watchers
fled
to
their
homes
some
did
move
because
they
had
lost
the
power
to
do
so
others
just
stood
it
a
hoax
an
a
joke
anna
said
now
wan
of
you
men
go
down
there
an
see
no
one
moved
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
pigsty
a
mournful
cry
was
heard
it
was
all
that
tradition
had
described
as
the
cry
of
the
banshee
the
banshee
it
is
ah
merciful
god
which
ov
us
is
t
b
tuk
i
wondther
it
was
eliza
who
spoke
and
she
continued
directing
her
talk
to
anna
an
it
th
long
arm
ov
th
almighty
it
is
raychin
down
t
give
us
a
warnin
do
ye
think
so
now
anna
if
it
wan
arm
of
god
i
know
where
th
other
is
addressing
the
watchers
anna
said
stand
here
do
budge
wan
of
ye
along
the
sides
of
the
houses
in
the
deep
shadow
anna
walked
until
she
got
to
the
end
of
the
row
just
around
the
corner
stood
the
sty
in
the
shadow
she
stood
with
her
back
to
the
wall
and
waited
the
watchers
were
breathless
and
what
they
saw
a
minute
later
gave
them
a
syncope
of
the
heart
that
they
never
forgot
they
saw
the
white
figure
emerge
again
and
they
saw
anna
stealthily
approach
and
enter
into
what
they
thought
was
a
struggle
with
it
they
gasped
when
they
saw
her
a
moment
later
bring
the
white
figure
along
with
her
as
she
came
nearer
it
looked
limp
and
pliable
for
it
hung
over
her
arm
it
that
divil
ben
green
she
said
as
she
threw
a
white
sheet
at
their
feet
hell
roast
on
a
brandther
said
one
the
divil
gut
like
a
herrin
said
another
four
of
the
younger
men
having
been
shamed
by
their
own
cowardice
made
a
raid
on
the
sty
and
next
day
when
ben
came
to
the
funeral
he
looked
very
much
the
worse
for
wear
ben
was
a
friend
of
henry
and
a
good
deal
of
a
practical
joker
anna
heard
of
what
happened
and
she
directed
that
he
be
one
of
the
four
men
to
lower
the
coffin
into
the
grave
as
a
moiety
of
consolation
johnny
murdock
made
strenuous
objections
to
this
why
anna
asked
bekase
he
said
shure
th
divil
nearly
kilt
kitty
be
th
fright
but
she
was
purty
comfortable
th
rest
of
th
time
oh

lifted
a
gey
big
burden
from
heart
last
night
did
ye
johnny
aye
an
if

anna
he
came
close
and
whispered
into
her
ear

t
thry
danged
hard
t
take
th
heart
as
well
as
th
throuble
what
diz
kitty

she
switherin
chapter
vi
the
apotheosis
of
hughie
thornton
anna
was
an
epistle
to
pogue
entry
and
my
only
excuse
for
dragging
hughie
thornton
into
this
narrative
is
that
he
was
a
commentary
on
anna
he
was
only
once
in
our
house
but
that
was
an
occasion
and
for
many
years
we
dated
things
that
happened
about
that
time
as
about
before
or
after
the
night
hughie
stayed
in
the
pigsty
we
lived
in
the
social
cellar
hughie
led
a
precarious
existence
in
the
he
was
the
of
several
towns
of
which
antrim
was
the
largest
he
was
a
short
man
with
a
face
eyes
like
a
mouse
eyebrows
that
looked
like
scrubbing
brushes
and
a
beard
cropped
close
with
scissors
or
a
knife
he
wore
two
coats
two
pairs
of
trousers
and
several
waistcoats
all
at
the
same
time
winter
and
summer
his
old
battered
hat
looked
like
a
crow
nest
his
wardrobe
was
so
elaborately
patched
that
practically
nothing
at
all
of
the
originals
remained
even
then
patches
of
his
old
withered
skin
could
be
seen
at
various
angles
the
thing
that
attracted
my
attention
more
than
anything
else
about
him
was
his
pockets
he
had
dozens
of
them
and
they
were
always
full
of
bread
crusts
scraps
of
meat
and
cooking
utensils
for
like
a
snail
he
carried
his
domicile
on
his
back
his
boots
looked
as
if
a
blacksmith
had
made
them
and
for
whangs
laces
he
used
strong
wire
he
was
preëminently
a
citizen
of
the
world
he
had
not
lived
in
a
house
in
half
a
century
a
haystack
in
summer
and
a
pigsty
in
winter
sufficed
him
he
had
a
deep
graphophone
voice
and
when
he
spoke
the
sound
was
like
the
creaking
of
a
barn
door
on
rusty
hinges
when
he
came
to
town
he
was
to
us
what
a
circus
is
to
boys
of
more
highly
favored
communities
there
were
several
interpretations
of
hughie
one
was
that
he
was
a
sent
back
that
is
he
had
gone
to
the
gates
of
a
less
cumbersome
life
and
peter
or
the
porter
at
the
other
gate
had
sent
him
back
to
perform
some
unfulfilled
task
another
was
that
he
was
a
nobleman
of
an
ancient
line
who
was
wandering
over
the
earth
in
disguise
in
search
of
the
grail
a
third
and
the
most
popular
one
was
that
he
was
just
a
common
beggar
and
an
unmitigated
liar
the
second
interpretation
was
made
more
plausible
by
the
fact
that
he
rather
enjoyed
his
reputation
as
a
liar
for
wise
ones
said
he
jist
on
on
one
of
his
visits
to
antrim
hughie
got
into
a
barrel
of
trouble
he
was
charged
rumor
charged
him
with
having
blinked
a
widow
cow
it
was
noised
abroad
that
he
had
been
caught
in
the
act
of
skellyin
at
her
the
story
gathered
in
volume
as
it
went
from
mouth
to
mouth
until
it
crystallized
as
a
crime
in
the
minds
of
half
a
dozen
of
our
toughest
citizens
boys
who
hankered
for
excitement
as
a
hungry
stomach
hankers
for
food
he
was
finally
rounded
up
in
a
field
adjoining
the
mill
row
and
pelted
with
stones
i
was
of
the
gallery
that
watched
the
fun
i
watched
until
a
track
of
blood
streaked
down
hughie
face
then
i
ran
home
and
told
anna
ma
i
yelled
breathlessly
they
killin
hughie
thornton
jamie
threw
his
work
down
and
accompanied
anna
over
the
little
garden
patches
to
the
wall
that
protected
the
field
through
the
gap
they
went
and
found
poor
hughie
in
bad
shape
he
was
crying
and
he
cried
like
a
brass
band
his
head
and
face
had
been
cut
in
several
places
and
his
face
and
clothes
were
red
they
brought
him
home
a
crowd
followed
and
filled
pogue
entry
a
crowd
that
was
about
equally
divided
in
sentiment
against
hughie
and
against
the
toughs
i
borrowed
a
can
of
water
from
mcgrath
and
another
from
the
gainers
and
anna
washed
old
hughie
wounds
in
jamie
tub
it
was
a
great
operation
hughie
of
course
refused
to
divest
himself
of
any
clothing
and
as
she
said
afterwards
it
was
like
dhressin
th
woonds
of
a
haystack
one
of
my
older
brothers
came
home
and
cleared
the
entry
and
we
sat
down
to
our
and
buttermilk
an
extra
cup
of
good
hot
strong
tea
was
the
finishing
touch
to
the
samaritan
act
jamie
had
scant
sympathy
with
the
he
had
always
called
him
hard
names
in
language
not
lawful
to
utter
and
even
in
this
critical
exigency
was
not
over
tender
anna
saw
a
human
need
and
tried
to
supply
it
did
ye
blink
th
cow
jamie
asked
as
we
sat
around
the
candle
after
supper
divil
a
blink
said
hughie
what

the

little
sunday
shawl
around
her
shoulders
tightened
the
strings
of
her
cap
under
her
chin
and
went
out
we
gasped
with
astonishment
what
on
earth
could
she
be
going
out
for
she
never
went
out
at
night
everybody
came
to
her
there
was
something
so
mysterious
in
that
sudden
exit
that
we
just
looked
at
our
guest
without
understanding
a
word
he
said
jamie
opened
up
another
line
of
inquiry
th
say
yer
a
terrible
liar

hughie
said
without
the
slightest
hesitation

he
took
a
live
coal
and
stoked
up
the
bowl
of
his
old
the
smacking
of
his
lips
could
have
been
heard
at
the
mouth
of
entry
we
waited
with
breathless
interest
when
he
had
finished
he
knocked
the
ashes
out
on
the
toe
of
his
brogue
and
talked
for
nearly
an
hour
of
the
great
event
in
which
he
covered
himself
with
glory
it
was
a
fierce
encounter
according
to
hughie
the
then
champion
being
a
ballymena
man
by
the
name
of
jack
rooney
jack
and
a
bunch
of
vagabonds
sat
on
a
stone
pile
near
ballyclare
when
hughie
hove
in
sight
the
was
at
once
challenged
to
divest
himself
of
half
his
clothes
or
enter
the
contest
he
entered
with
the
result
that
ballymena
lost
the
championship
the
concluding
round
as
hughie
recited
it
was
as
follows

useless

about
minor

we
wanted

story

wanted
it
at
once
for
we
understood
that
hughie
went
to

with
the
crows

the
perspiration

in
big
beads

furrowed

against

several
figures

yards

farther
away

silent
and
motionless

no
mistake
about
it
he
directed
anna
attention
to
them
and
she
made
light
of
it
when
they

fear
for

into
his
ear
for

that

went
into
their
room
conversing
in
an
undertone
the
thing
was
so
uncanny
to
me
that
it
was
three
next
morning
before
i
went
to
sleep
as
early
as
six
there
was
an
unusual
shuffling
and
clattering
of
feet
over
the
cobblestones
in
pogue
entry
we
knew
everybody
in
the
entry
by
the
sound
of
their
footfall

by
the
feet
of
strangers

without

mulholland
and
hainey
seemed
supremely
concerned
about
the
weather
from
all
they
said

the
time
hughie
scrambled
out

a
dozen
men
women
and
boys
around
the
sty
as

eyes
of
the

were
scrutinizing
him
sandy

with
him
and
wished
him
a
pleasant

pockets

small
package

and
led
hughie
into

their
full
capacity
and
those
who
gathered
around
the
table

asked
no
but
i
had
a
wondtherful
dhrame
the
announcement
was
a
disappointment
to
us
we
had
dreams
of
our
own
and
to
have
right
at
our
fireside
the
one
man
in
all
the
world
who
things
and
get
merely
a
dream
from
him
was
to
say
the
least
discouraging
i

this
sty

him
says
he
an
off
he
wint
here
was
something
after
all
that
gave
us
more
excitement
than
a
banshee
story
we
had
a
sty
we
had
hoped
for
years
for
a
pig
we
had
been
forced
often
to
use
some
of
the
sty
for
fuel
but
in
good
times
jamie
had
always
replaced
the
boards
this
was
a
real
vision
and
we
were
satisfied
jamie
faith
in
hughie
soared
high
at
the
time
but
a
few
months
later
it
fell
to
zero
anna
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
would
remind
us
of
hughie
prophecy
one
day
he
wiped
the
vision
off
the
slate
t
h
l
wi
hughie
he
said
some
night
he
come
back
an
slape
there
thin
we
haave
a
pig
in
th
sty
shure
as
he
left
our
house
that
morning
he
was
greeted
in
a
most
unusual
manner
by
a
score
of
people
who
crowded
the
entry
men
and
women
gathered
around
him
they
inspected
the
wounds
they
gave
their
blessing
in
as
many
varieties
as
there
were
people
present
the
new
attitude
toward
the
beggar
baffled
us
generally
he
was
considered
a
good
deal
of
a
nuisance
and
something
of
a
fraud
but
that
morning
he
was
looked
upon
as
a
saint
as
one
inspired
as
one
capable
of
bestowing
benedictions
on
the
young
and
giving
luck
to
the
old
out
of
their
penury
and
want
they
brought
gifts
of
food
tobacco
cloth
for
patches
and
needles
and
thread
he
was
overwhelmed
and
and
as
his
mission
of
gathering
food
for
a
few
weeks
was
accomplished
he
made
for
the
town
head
when
he
left
the
entry
the
small
crowd
grew
into
a
big
one
and
he
was
the
center
of
a
throng
as
he
made
his
way
north
when
he
reached
the
town
well
maggie
mckinstry
had
several
small
children
in
waiting
and
hughie
was
asked
to
give
them
a
blessing
it
was
a
new
atmosphere
to
him
but
he
bungled
through
it
the
more
unintelligible
his
jabbering
the
more
assured
were
the
recipients
of
his
power
to
bless
one
of
the
boys
who
stoned
him
was
brought
by
his
father
to
ask
forgiveness
god
save
ye
kindly
hughie
said
to
him
th
woonds
ye
made
haave
been
turned
into
blessin
galore
he
came
in
despised
he
went
out
a
saint
it
proved
to
be
hughie
last
visit
to
antrim
his
going
out
of
life
was
a
mystery
and
as
the
years
went
by
tradition
accorded
him
an
exit
not
unlike
that
of
moses
i
was
amongst
those
the
current
of
whose
lives
were
supposed
to
have
been
changed
by
the
touch
of
his
hand
on
that
last
visit
anna
alone
knew
the
secret
of
his
alleged
sainthood
she
was
the
author
and
publisher
of
it
that
night
when
she
left
us
with
hughie
she
gathered
together
in
conlon
a
few
people
whose
minds
were
as
an
open
book
to
her
she
told
them
that
the
was
of
an
ancient
line
wandering
the
earth
in
search
of
the
holy
grail
but
that
as
he
wandered
he
was
recording
in
a
secret
book
the
deeds
of
the
poor
she
knew
exactly
how
the
news
would
travel
and
where
one
superstition
stoned
him
and
another
canonized
him
dear
she
said
to
me
many
many
years
afterwards
a
good
thought
will
thravel
as
fast
an
as
far
as
a
bad

night

replied
as
she
gazed
into
the
smokeless
flames
he
took
his
short
black
pipe
out
of
his

spat
into
the
burning
sods
and
added

one
job
that
day
a

of
mcguckin
boots
they
had
been
and
heeled
and
my
sister
had
taken
them
home
with
orders
what
to
bring
home
for
supper
the
last
handful
of
peat
had
been
put
on
the
fire
the
cobbler
bench
had
been
put
aside
for
the
night
and
we
gathered
closely
around
the
hearth
the
town
clock
struck
eight
what

said

if

had
th
wits
to
obsarve
over
the
fire
hung
a
pot
on
the
chain
and
close
to
the
turf
coals
sat
the
kettle
singing
nothing
of
that
life
has
left
a
more
lasting
impression
than
the
singing
of
the
kettle
it
sang
a
dirge
that
night
but
it
usually
sang
of
hope
it
was
ever
the
harbinger
of
the
thing
that
was
most
indispensable
in
that
home
of
want
a
cup
of
tea
often
it
was
tea
without
milk
sometimes
without
sugar
but
always
tea
if
it
came
to
a
choice
between
tea
and
bread
we
went
without
bread
anna
did
not
relish
the
reflection
on
her
judgment
and
remained
silent
there
was
a
loud
noise
at
the
door
jazus
jamie
exclaimed
it
snowin
some
one
was
kicking
the
snow
off
against
the

lifted
and
in
walked
felix

the
bogman
what
th
blazes
are
ye
in
th
dark
fur
felix
asked
in
a
deep
hoarse
voice
his
old
cap
was
pulled
down
over
his
ears
his
head
and
shoulders
were
covered
with
snow
as
he
shook
it
off
we
shivered
we
were
in
debt
to
felix
for
a
load
of
turf
and
we
suspected
he
had
called
for
the
money
anna
lit
the
candle
she
was
saving
for
the
bogman
threw
his
cap
and
overcoat
over
in
the
corner
on
the
lasts
and
sat
down
i
frozen
t
death
he
said
as
he
proceeded
to
take
off
his
brogues
as
he
came
up
close
to
the
coals
we
were
smitten
with
his
foul
breath
and
in
consequence
gave
him
a
wider
berth
he
had
been
drinking
where
th
mare
anna
asked

said

the
town
clock
struck
nine
felix
removed
his
socks
pushed
his
stool
aside
and
sat
down
on
the
mud
floor
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
flat
on
his
back
fast
asleep
and
snoring
loudly
the
fire
grew
smaller
anna
husbanded
the
diminishing
embers
by
keeping
them
closely
together
with
the
long
tongs
the
wind
howled
and
screamed
the
window
rattled
the
door
creaked
on
its
hinges
and
every
few
minutes
a
gust
of
wind
came
down
the
chimney
and
blew
the
ashes
into
our
faces
we
huddled
nearer
the
fire
ca
ye
fix
up
that
oul
craither
head
a
bit
jamie
asked
i
brought
over
the
bogman
coat
anna
made
a
pillow
of
it
and
placed
it
under
his
head
he
turned
over
on
his
side
as
he
did
so
a
handful
of
small
change
rolled
out
of
his
pocket
think
of
that
now
jamie
said
as
he
gathered
it
up
and
stuffed
it
back
where
it
belonged
an
oul
dhrunken
turf
dhriver
wi
money
t
waste
while
we
starvin
from
that
moment
we
were
acutely
hungry
this
new
incident
rendered
the
condition
poignant
maybe
boyle
an
th
wains
are
as
hungry
as
we
are
anna
remarked
wi
a
bogful
o
turf
at
th
doore
th
ca
eat
turf
jamie
th
can
warm
their
shins
that
we
can
do
in
a
minute
or
two
the
rapidly
diminishing
coals
were
arranged
once
more
they
were
a
mere
handful
now
and
the
house
was
cold
there
were
two
big
holes
in
the
chimney
where
jamie
kept
old
pipes
pipe
cleaners
bits
of
rags
and
scraps
of
tobacco
he
liked
to
hide
a
scrap
or
two
there
and
in
times
of
scarcity
make
himself
believe
he
them
his
last
puff
of
smoke
had
gone
up
the
chimney
hours
ago
he
searched
both
holes
without
success
a
bright
idea
struck
him
he
searched
for
boyle
pipe
he
searched
in
vain
holy
moses
he
exclaimed
what
a
breath
a
pint
ov
that
wud
make
a
mule
dhrunk
thry
it
jamie
anna
said
laughing
thry
it
yerself
yer
a
good
dale
more
ov
a
judge
he
said
snappishly
a
wild
gust
of
wind
came
down
the
chimney
and
blew
the
loose
ashes
off
the
hearth
jamie
ensconced
himself
in
his
corner
a
picture
of
despair
i
wondther
if
billy
in
bed
he
said
ye
need
fumigatin
afther
smokin
billy
tobacco
jamie
i
smoke
tobacco
scraped
out
o
the
ov
th
oul
divil
in
hell
he
replied
he
arose
put
on
his
muffler
and
made
ready
to
visit
the
sweep
on
the
way
to
the
door
another
idea
turned
him
back
he
put
on
the
overcoat
and
cap
anna
divining
his
intention
said
that
th
first
sign
of
sense
i
see
in
you
for
a
month
of
sundays
ye
cud
see
it
in
a
month
ov
easther
sundays
aanyway
he
retorted
with
a
superior
toss
of
his
head
anna
kept
up
a
rapid
fire
of
witty
remarks
she
injected
humor
into
the
situation
and
laughed
like
a
girl
and
although
she
felt
the
pangs
more
keenly
than
any
of
us
her
laughter
was
genuine
and
natural
jamie
had
his
empty
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
by
force
of
habit
he
picked
up
in
the
tongs
a
little
bit
of
live
coal
to
light
it
we
all
tittered
th
h
l
he
muttered
as
he
made
for
the
door
before
he
reached
it
my
sister
walked
in
mcguckin
was
at
home
his
wife
could
pay
we
saw
the
whole
story
on
her
face
every
pang
of
it
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
before
she
got
out
a
sentence
of
the
tale
of
woe
she
noticed
the
old
man
in
boyle
clothing
and
burst
out
laughing
so
hearty
and
boisterous
was
it
that
we
all
again
caught
the
contagion
and
laughed
with
her
sorrow
was
it
had
its
roots
away
down
at
the
bottom
of
things
but
laughter
was
always
up
near
the
surface
and
could
be
tapped
on
the
slightest
provocation
it
was
a
a
way
of
escape
for
the
overflow
there
were
times
when
sorrow
was
too
deep
for
tears
but
there
never
was
a
time
when
we
could
laugh
people
in
our
town
who
expected
visitors
to
knock
provided
a
knocker
the
knocker
was
a
distinct
line
of
social
demarcation
we
lived
below
the
line
the
minister
and
the
tract
distributor
were
the
only
persons
who
ever
knocked
at
our
door
scarcely
had
our
laughter
died
away
when
the
door
opened
and
there
entered
in
the
sweep
of
a
blizzard
tail
billy
the
gust
of
cold
winter
wind
made
us
shiver
again
and
we
drew
up
closer
to
the
dying
fire
so
small
now
as
to
be
seen
with
difficulty
be
th
seven
crosses
ov
arbow
jamie
he
said
i
glad
yer
awake
me
bhoy
if
ye
had
i
haave
pulled
ye
out
be
th
tail
ov
yer
shirt
i
was
jist
within
an
ace
ov
goin
over
an
pullin
ye
out
be
th
heels
myself
the
stepped
forward
and
tapping
jamie
on
the
forehead
said
two
great
minds
workin
on
th
same
thought
shud
projuce
wondtherful
results
jamie
lend
me
a
chew
ov
tobacco
ye
had
larks
for

billy
yer
jokin
jamie
said
larks
be
damned
billy
said
m
tongue
stickin
t
th
roof
ov
me
mouth
again
we
laughed
while
the
two
men
stood
looking
at
each
other
speechless
ye
can
do
switherin
as
easy
sittin
as
standin
anna
said
and
billy
sat
down
the
bogman
story
was
repeated
in
minutest
detail
the
sweep
scratched
his
sooty
head
and
looked
wise
it
gone
anna
said
quietly
and
we
all
looked
toward
the
fire
it
was
dead
the
last
spark
had
been
extinguished
we
shivered
we
do
need
so
many
stools
aanyway
jamie
said
i
get
a
hatchet
an
we
haave
a
fire
in
no
time
t
be
freezin
t
death
wi
a
bogman
goin
t
waste
is
unchristian
say
th
laste
billy
ventured
every
time
we
get
to
th
end
of
th
tether
god
appears
anna
said
reassuringly
as
she
pinned
her
shawl
closer
around
her
neck
there
nothin
but
empty
bowels
and
empty
pipes
in
our
house
the
sweep
said
but
we
got
half
a
dozen
good
turf
left
well
it
a
long
lane
that
got
no
turnin
ye
might
lend
us
thim
jamie
suggested
if
ye
excuse
m
fur
a
minit
i
warm
this
house
an
may
the
virgin
choke
m
in
th
nixt
chimley
i
sweep
if
i
do
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
with
six
black
turf
the
fire
was
rebuilt
and
we
basked
in
its
warm
white
glow
the
bogman
snored
on
billy
inquired
about
the
amount
of
his
change
then
he
became
solicitous
about
his
comfort
on
the
floor
each
suggestion
was
a
furtive
flank
movement
on
boyle
loose
change
anna
saw
the
bent
of
his
mind
and
tried
to
divert
his
attention
did
ye
ever
hear
billy
she
said
that
if
we
stand
a
dhrunk
maan
on
his
head
it
sobers
him
be
the
powers
no
they
say
she
said
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
that
it
empties
him
of
his
contents
aye
sighed
the
sweep
there
something
in
that
anna
let
thry
it
on
boyle
there
was
an
element
of
excitement
in
the
suggestion
and
we
youngsters
hoped
it
would
be
carried
out
billy
made
a
move
to
suit
the
action
to
the
thought
but
anna
pushed
him
gently
back
jamie
mouth
is
as
wathry
as
yours
billy
but
we
take
no
short
cuts
we
go
th
long
way
around
that
seemed
a
to
hope
my
sisters
began
to
whimper
and
sniffle
we
had
many
devices
for
diverting
hunger
the
one
always
used
as
a
last
resort
was
the
stories
of
the
great
famine
we
were
particularly
helped
by
one
about
a
family
half
of
whom
died
around
a
pot
of
that
had
come
too
late
when
we
heard
jamie
say
things
are
purty
bad
but
they
not
as
bad
as
they
might
be
we
knew
a
famine
story
was
on
the
way
hould
yer
horses
there
a
minute
billy
broke
in
he
took
the
and
before
we
knew
what
he
was
about
he
had
taken
a
bunch
of
dried
rosemary
from
the
and
was
rubbing
it
in
his
hands

like
the

of
a
censer
the
men
laughed
and
joked
over
the
discovery
the
sweep
indulged
himself
in
some
extravagant
statements
one
of
which
became
a
household
word
with
us
jamie
he
said
as
he
removed
his
pipe
and
looked
seriously
at
my
father

was

our
hunger
pangs
in
the
excitement
jamie
filled
his
pipe
and
the
two
men
smoked
for
a
few
minutes
then
a
fly
appeared
in
the
precious
ointment
my
father
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
looked
inquisitively
at
billy
m
head
spinnin
like

he
exclaimed

before

the

and
yelled

the
power
of
his
lungs
whoa
back
ye
dhirty
baste
back
the
wild
yell
chilled
the
blood
in
our
veins
he
sat
up
looked
at
the
black
figure
of
the
sweep
for
a
moment
then
made
a
spring
at
billy
and
before
any
one
could
interfere
poor
billy
had
been
felled
to
the
floor
with
a
terrible
smash
on
the
jaw
then
he
jumped
on
him
we
youngsters
raised
a
howl
that
awoke
the
sleepers
in
pogue
entry
jamie
and
billy
soon
overpowered
boyle
when
the
neighbors
arrived
they

after
some

from

the
sweep
went
off
on
his
midnight
errand
the
neighbors
were
sent
home
the
kettle
replaced
the
pot
on
the
chain
and
we
gathered
full
of
ecstasy
close
to
the
fire
whisht
anna
said
we
listened
above
the
roar
of
the
wind
and
the
rattling
of

he
put
his
bundles
down
on

and
vigorously
swung
his
arms
like
flails
around
him
to
thaw
himself
out
anna
arranged
the
table
and
prepared
the
meal
billy
and
jamie
went

remarked
humorously
boyle
stretched
himself
on
the
floor
and
yawned
the
little
table
was
brought
near
the
fire
the
loaf
was
cut
in
slices
and
divided
it
was
a
scene
that
brought
us
to
the
edge
of
tears
tears
of
joy
anna
face
particularly
beamed
she
talked
as
she
prepared
and
her
talk
was
of
god
appearance
at
the
end
of
every
tether
and
of
the
silver
lining
on
the
edge
of
every
cloud
she
had
a
penchant
for
mottoes
but
she
never
used
them
in
a
siege
it
was
when
the
siege
was
broken
she
poured
them
in
and
they
found
a
welcome
as
she
spoke
of
god
bringing
relief
boyle
got
up
on
his
haunches
anna
he
said

even
if

there
by

when
all
was
ready
we
gathered
around
the
table
how
i
wish
we
could
sing
she
said
as
she
looked
at
us
the
answer
was
on
every
face
hunger
would
not
wait
on
ceremony
we
were
awed
into
stillness
and
silence
however
when
she
raised
her
hand
in
benediction
we
bowed
our
heads
boyle
crossed
himself

amen
chapter
viii
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
i
sat
on
a
fence
in
a
potato
field
whittling
an
alder
stick
into
a
one
afternoon
in
the
early
autumn
when
i
noticed
at
the
other
end
of
the
field
the
figure
of
the
master
he
was
dressed
as
usual
in
light
gray
and
as
usual
rode
a
fine
horse
i
dropped
off
the
fence
as
if
i
had
been
shot
he
urged
the
horse
to
a
gallop
i
pushed
the
clumps
of
red
hair
under
my
cap
and
pressed
it
down
tightly
on
my
head
then
i
adjusted
the
string
that
served
as
a
suspender
on
came
the
galloping
horse
a
few
more
lightning
touches
to
what
covered
my
nakedness
and
he
reined
up
in
front
of
me
i
straightened
up
like
a
piece
of
whalebone
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
in
that
imperious
voice
of
his
kapin
th
crows
off
th
pirtas
yer
honor
you
need
a
new
shirt
he
said
the
blood
rushed
to
my
face
i
tried
to
answer
but
the
attempt
seemed
to
choke
me
you
need
a
new
shirt
he
almost
yelled
at
me
i
saw
a
smile
playing
about
the
corners
of
his
fine
large
eyes
it
gave
me
courage
aye
yer
honor
that
thrue
why
do
you
get
one
the
answer
left
my
mind
and
traveled
like
a
flash
to
the
glottis
but
that
part
of
the
machinery
was
out
of
order
and
the
answer
hung
fire
i
paused
drew
a
long
breath
that
strained
the
string
then
matching
his
thin
smile
with
a
thick
grin
i
replied
did
yer
honor
iver
work
fur
four
shillin
a
week
and
share
it
wid
nine
others
no
he
said
and
the
imprisoned
smile
was
released
well
if
ye
iver
do
shure
ye
be
lucky
to
haave
skin
let
alone
shirt
you
consider
yourself
lucky
then
aye
middlin
he
galloped
away
and
i
lay
down
flat
on
my
back
wiped
the
sweat
from
my
brow
with
the
sleeve
of
my
jacket
turned
the
hair
loose
and
eased
up
the
string
that
night
at
the
first
sound
of
the
bell
i
took
to
my
heels
through
the
fields
through
the
yard
and
down
the
belfast
road
to
withero
willie
was
just
quitting
for
the
day
i
was
almost
breathless
but
i
blurted
out
what
then
seemed
to
me
the
most
important
happening
in
my
life
willie
took
his
off
and
looked
at
me
so
ye
had
a
crack
wi
the
masther
did
ye
aye
quite
a
crack
he
mistuk
ye
fur
a
horse
he
said
this
damper
on
my
enthusiasm
drew
an
instant
reply
no
nor
an
ass
naither
willie
bundled
up
his
hammers
and
prepared
to
go
home
he
took
out
his
flint
and
steel
over
the
flint
he
laid
a
piece
of
brown
paper
chemically
treated
then
he
struck
the
flint
a
sharp
blow
with
the
steel
a
spark
was
produced
the
spark
ignited
the
paper
it
began
to
burn
in
a
smoldering
blazeless
way
he
stuffed
the
paper
into
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
and
began
the
smoke
that
was
to
carry
him
over
the
journey
home
i
shouldered
some
of
his
hammers
and
we
trudged
along
the
road
toward
antrim

but
i
dreaded
his
critical
mind
when
we
got
to
the
railway
bridge
he
laid
his
hammers
on
the
wall
while
he
relit
his
pipe
i
saw
my
last
opportunity
and
seized
it

be
inclined
that
way
dhrawn
eleven
blanks
maybe
she
dhrawn
a
prize
afther
all
who
knows
old
mccabe
the
road
mender
overtook
us
and
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
i
was
seen
but
not
heard
that
night
i
sat
by
her
side
in
the
and
recited
the
events
of
the
day
it
had
been
full
of
magic
mystery
and
meaning
to
me
the
meaning
was
a
little
clearer
to
me
after
the
recital
withero
sometimes
talks
like
a
book
wi
no
laves
in
it
she
said
but
most
of
the
time
he
nearer
the
facts
than
most
of
us
it
is
all
blether
dear
we
sat
up
late
long
after
the
others
had
gone
to
sleep
she
read
softly
a
chapter
of
pilgrim
progress
the
chapter
in
which
he
is
relieved
of
his
burden
i
see
now
that
woodcut
of
a
gate
and
over
the
gate
the
words
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
she
had
read
it
before
i
was
familiar
with
it
but
in
the
light
of
that
day
experience
it
had
a
new
meaning
she
warned
me
however
that
my
name
was
neither
pilgrim
nor
withero
and
in
elucidating
her
meaning
she
explained
the
phrase
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
i
learned
to
listen
for
the
sound
thereof
and
i
wondered
from
whence
it
came
not
only
the
wind
of
the
heavens
but
the
spirit
that
moved
men
in
so
many
directions
the
last
act
of
that
memorable
night
was
the
making
of
a
picture
it
took
many
years
to
find
out
its
meaning
but
every
stroke
of
the
brush
is
as
plain
to
me
now
as
they
were
then
ye
do
somethin
for
me
aye
aanything
in
th
world
ye
wo
glunch
nor
ask
questions
not
a
question
shut
yer
eyes
an
stan
close
t
th
table
i
obeyed
she
put
into
each
hand
a
smooth
stick
with
which
jamie
had
smoothed
the
soles
of
shoes
jist
for
th
now
these
are
the
handles
of
a
plow
keep
yer
eyes
shut
tight
ye
seen
a
maan
plowin
a
field
aye
think
that
ye
see
a
long
long
field
ye
plowin
it
the
other
end
is
so
far
away
ye
ca
see
it
ye
see
a
wee
bit
of
the
furrow
jist
a
wee
bit
squeeze
th
plow
handles
i
squeezed
d
see
th
trees
yonder
aye
an
th
birds
pickin
in
th
furrow
she
took
the
sticks
away
and
gently
pushed
me
on
a
stool
and
told
me
i
might
open
my
eyes
that
quare
i
said
listen
dear
ye
put
yer
han
t
th
plow
ye
must
niver
niver
take
it
away
all
through
life
ye

and

but

in
th
furrow
all
the
time
ye
change
horses
ye
change
clothes
ye
change
yerself
but
ye
always
be
in
the
furrow
plowin
plowin
plowin
i
go

bit
of
th
way
jamie
go
a
bit

brothers
an
sisters
a
bit
but
we
dhrap
out
wan
b
wan
ye
god
plowmaan
as
i
stood
to
say
she
put
her
hand
on
my
head
and
muttered
something
that
was
not
intended
for
me
to
hear
then
she
kissed
me
good
night
and
i
climbed
to
my
pallet
under
the
thatch
i
was
afraid
to
sleep
lest
the
feelin
should
take
wings
when
i
was
convinced
that
some
of
it
at
least
would
remain
i
tried
to
sleep
and
could
the
mingled
ecstasy
and
excitement
was
too
intense
i
heard
the
town
clock
strike
the
hours
far
into
the
morning
before
she
awoke
next
morning
i
had
exhausted
every
agency
in
the
house
that
would
coördinate
flesh
and
spirit
when
i
was
ready
i
tiptoed
to
her
bedside
and
touched
her
on
the
cheek
instantly
she
awoke
and
sat
upright
i
put
my
hands
on
my
hips
and
danced
before
her
it
was
a
noiseless
dance
with
bare
feet
on
the
mud
floor
her
long
thin
arms
shot
out
toward
me
and
i
buried
myself
in
them
so
it
stayed
she
whispered
in
my
ear
aye
an
there
more
of
it
she
arose
and
dressed
quickly
a
live
coal
was
scraped
out
of
the
ashes
and
a
turf
fire
built
around
it
my
feet
were
winged
as
i
flew
to
the
town
well
for
water
when
i
returned
she
had
several
slices
of
toast
ready
toast
was
a
luxury
of
course
there
was
always
or
nearly
always
bread
and
often
there
was
butter
but
toast
to
the
very
poor
in
those
days
was
merely
a
matter
of
bread
and
butter
fire
and
time
it
was
more
often
inclination
that
turned
the
balance
for
or
against
it
and
inclination
always
came
on
the
back
of
some
emotion
chance
or
circumstance
here
all
the
elements
met
and
the
result
was
toast
i
took
a
mouthful
of
her
tea
out
of
her
cup
she
reciprocated
we
were
like
children
maybe
we
were
love
tipped
our
tongues
winged
our
feet
opened
our
hearts
and
hands
and
permeated
every
thought
and
act
she
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
entry
until
i
disappeared
at
the
town
head
while
i
was
yet
within
sight
i
looked
back
half
a
dozen
times
and
we
waved
our
hands
it
was
nearly
a
year
before
a
dark
line
entered
this
spiritual
spectrum
it
was
inevitable
that
such
a
mental
condition
ever
in
search
of
a
larger
expression
should
gravitate
toward
the
church
it
has
seemed
also
that
it
was
just
as
inevitable
that
the
best
thought
of
which
the
church
has
been
the
custodian
should
be
crystallized
into
a
creed
i
was
promoted
to
the
big
house
there
of
course
i
was
overhauled
and
put
in
touch
with
the
fittings
and
furniture
as
a
flunkey
i
had
my
first
dose
of
boiled
linen
and
i
liked
it
i
was
enabled
now
to
attend
church
and
sunday
school
indeed
i
would
have
gone
there
religion
or
no
religion
for
where
else
could
i
have
sported
a
white
shirt
and
collar
with
my
boiled
linen
and
my
brain
stuffed
with
texts
i
gradually
drew
away
from
the
and
never
again
did
i
help
willie
withero
to
carry
his
hammers
ah
if
one
could
only
go
back
over
life
and
correct
the
mistakes
gradually
i
lost
the
warm
human
feeling
and
substituted
for
it
a
theology
i
began
to
look
upon
my
mother
as
one
about
whose
salvation
there
was
some
doubt
i
urged
her
to
attend
church
forms
and
ceremonies
became
the
things
and
the
life
and
the
spirit
were
proportionately
unimportant
i
became
mildewed
with
the
blight
of
respectability
i
became
the
possessor
of
a
hard
hat
that
i
might
ape
the
respectables
i
walked
home
every
night
from
ballycraigie
with
jamie
wallace
and
jamie
was
the
working
man
in
the
town
i
was
treading
a
pathway
i
was
getting
on
a
good
slice
of
my
new
religion
consisted
in
excellency
of
service
to
my
employers
my
betters
preacher
priest
and
peasant
thought
alike
on
these
topics
anna
was
pleased
to
see
me
in
a
new
garb
but
she
noticed
and
i
noticed
that
i
had
grown
away
from
the
corner
in
the
light
of
my
new
adjustment
i
saw
plainer
but
duty
may
become
a
hammer
by
which
affection
may
be
beaten
to
death
i
imagined
the
plow
was
going
nicely
in
the
furrow
for
i
conscious
of
striking
any
snags
or
stones
but
anna
said
a
plowman
who
skims
th
surface
of
th
sod
strikes
no
stones
dear
but
it
because
he
is
plowin
i
have
plowed
deep
enough
since
but
too
late
to
go
back
and
compare
notes
she
was
pained
but
tried
to
hide
it
if
she
was
on
the
point
of
tears
she
would
tell
a
funny
story
acushla
she
said
to
me
one
night
after
a
theological
discussion
sure
ye
remind
me
of
a
ducklin
hatched
by
a
hen
why
we
at
home
in
conthrary
elements
ye
use
texts
t
fight
with
an
i
use
thim
to
get
pace
of
heart
are
you
wiser
nor
holmes
an
william
brennan
an
miss
mcgee
i
asked
them
th
ones
that
think
as
i
do
i
mane
i
think
as
they
do
no
i
not
as
wise
as
aany
of
thim
but
standin
outside
a
wee
bit
i
can
see
things
that
ca
be
seen
inside
forby
they
haave
no
special
pathway
t
god
that
shut
t
me
nor
yer
oul
father
nor
willie
withero
sometimes
jamie
took
a
hand
once
when
he
thought
anna
was
going
to
cry
in
an
argument
he
wheeled
around
in
his
seat
and
delivered
himself
i
tell
ye
anna
that
whelp
needs
a
good
argyment
wi
th
tongs
jist
take
thim
an
hit
a
skite
on
the
jaw
wi
thim
an
i
say
that
no
clinch
to
an
argyment
i
said
an
thruth
is
thruth
aye
an
tongs
is
tongs
an
some
o
ye
young
upstarts
whin
ye
get
a
dickey
on
an
a
collar
think
yer
jist
ready
t
sit
down
t
tay
wi
god
anna
explained
and
gave
me
more
credit
than
was
due
me
so
jamie
ended
the
colloquy
by
the
usual
cap
to
his
every
climax
well
what
th
do
i
know
about
thim
things
aanyway
let
haave
a
good
cup
o
tay
an
say
no
more
about
it
the
more
texts
i
knew
the
more
fanatical
i
became
and
the
more
of
a
fanatic
i
was
the
wider
grew
the
chasm
that
divided
me
from
my
mother
i
talked
as
if
i
knew
every
saint
in
heaven
and
every
divil
in
hell
she
was
more
than
patient
with
me
though
my
spiritual
conceit
must
have
given
her
many
a
pang
antrim
was
just
beginning
to
get
accustomed
to
my
new
habiliments
of
boots
boiled
linen
and
hat
when
i
left
to
push
my
fortune
in
other
parts
my
enthusiasm
had
its
good
qualities
too
and
she
was
quick
to
recognize
them
quicker
than
to
notice
its
blemishes
my
last
hours
in
the
town
on
the
eve
of
my
first
departure
i
spent
with
her
i
feel
about
you
dear
she
said
laughing
as
micky
free
did
about
the
soul
of
his
father
in
purgatory
he
had
been
payin
for
masses
for
what
seemed
to
him
an
uncommonly
long
time
th
oul
bhoy
gettin
on
micky
asked
the
priest
well
micky
his
head
is
out
thin
i
know
th
rist
ov
will
be
out
soon
pay
for
no
more
masses
your
head
is
up
and
out
from
the
bottom
of
world
and
i
haave
faith
that
ye
purty
soon
be
all
out
an
some
day
ye
get
the
larger
view
for
ye
be
in
a
larger
place
an
haave
seen
more
of
people
an
more
of
the
world
i
have
two
letters
of
that
period
one
i
wrote
her
from
jerusalem
in
the
year
as
i
read
the
yellow
childish
epistle
i
am
stung
with
remorse
that
it
is
full
of
the
narrow
sectarianism
that
still
held
me
in
its
grip
the
other
is
dated
antrim
july
and
is
her
answer
to
my
sectarian
appeal
dear
boy
she
says
antrim
has
had
many
soldier
sons
in
lands
but
you
are
the
first
i
think
to
have
the
privilege
of
visiting
the
holy
land
jamie
and
i
are
proud
of
you
all
the
old
friends
have
read
your
letter
they
can
hardly
believe
it
do
worry
about
our
souls
when
we
come
one
by
one
in
the
twilight
of
life
each
of
us
jamie
and
i
will
have
our
sheaves
they
will
be
little
ones
but
we
are
little
people
i
want
no
glory
here
or
hereafter
that
jamie
can
not
share
i
gave
god
a
plowman
but
your
father
says
i
must
chalk
half
of
that
to
his
account
hold
tight
the
handles
and
plow
deep
we
watch
the
candle
and
every
wee
spark
thrills
our
hearts
for
we
know
it
a
letter
from
you
your
loving
mother
chapter
ix
beyond
th
meadows
an
th
clouds
when
the
announced
that
i
was
to
deliver
a
lecture
on
england
in
the
soudan
in
the
only
hall
in
the
town
antrim
turned
out
to
satisfy
its
curiosity
how
doth
this
man
know
not
having
learned
the
wise
ones
said
for
when
i
shook
the
dust
of
its
blessed
streets
from
my
brogues
seven
years
previously
i
was
an
illiterate
anna
could
have
told
them
but
none
of
the
wise
knew
her
for
curiously
enough
to
those
who
knew
of
her
existence
but
had
never
seen
her
she
was
known
as
jamie
wife
butchers
and
bakers
and
candlestick
makers
were
there
several
ministers
some
quality
near
quality
the
inhabitants
of
the
entries
in
the
scotch
quarter
and
all
the
newsboys
in
town
the
fact
that
i
personally
bribed
the
newsboys
accounted
for
their
presence
i
bought
them
out
and
reserved
the
front
seats
for
them
it
was
in
the
way
of
a
class
reunion
with
me
billy

gone
beyond
where
there
are
no
chimneys
and
ann
where
she
could
keep
clean
they
were
both
dead
many
of
the
old
familiar
faces
were
absent
they
too
had
gone
some
to
other
lands
some
to
another
world
jamie
was
there
he
sat
between
willie
withero
and
ben
baxter
he
heard
little
of
what
was
said
and
understood
less
of
what
he
heard
the
vicar
holmes
presided
there
was
a
vote
of
thanks
followed
by
the
customary
seconding
by
public
men
then

i
went

to
tell

the
hearth

been
swept
and
a
new
coat
of
whitening
applied
there
was
a
candle
burning
in
her
sconce
and
the
thin
yellow
rays
lit
up
the
glory
on
her
face
a
glory
that
was
encased
in
a
newly
tallied
white
cap
my
sister
sat
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
and
she
on
the
other
in

not
wonder
i
did
not
ask
why
they
did
not
make
a
supreme
effort
to
attend
the
lecture

knew
they
were
more
supremely
interested
than
i
was
they
had
never
heard
a
member
of
the
family
or
a
relative
speak
in
public
and
their
last
chance
had
passed
by
there
they
were
in
the
light
of
a
peat
fire
and
the
tallow
dip
supremely
happy

neighbors
came
in
for
a
word

with
laughter
in

voice
and
it
sounded
in
the
ears
of
those
present
as
polite
and
pleasing
as
anything
in
the
domain
of
their
amenities
they
arose
as
one
all
except
withero
and
he
could

jamie
gripped
him
by
a
leg
and
held
him
on
the
floor
just
as
he
sat
in
their
expressions
the
neighbors
unconsciously
revealed
what
the
lecture
and
the
story

but
a
hole
in

side
of
the
road
it

a
sentimental
journey

she
sint
me
this
he
pulled
out
of
an
inside
pocket
a
piece
of
paper
yellow
with
age
and
so
scuffed
with
handling
that
the
scrawl
was
scarcely
legible
stone
breaker
dublin
road
antrim
i
seen
him
in
the
ward
last
night
and
i
content
to
go
now
god
save
you
kindly
the
dummy
withero
having
unburdened
we
dandered
down
the
road
through
masserene
and
home
i
proposed
to
anna
a
little
trip
to
lough
neagh
in
a
jaunting
car
no
dear
it
no
use
i
want
to
mind
it
jist
as
jamie
and
i
saw
it
years
an
years
ago
i
see
it
here
in
th
corner
jist
as
plain
as
i
saw
it
then
forby
antrim
wud
never
get
over
th
shock
of
seein
me
in
a
jauntin
car
then
i
tell
you
of
a
shorter
journey
you
have
never
seen
the
steeple
it
the
most
perfect
of
all
the
round
towers
in
ireland
and
just
one
mile
from
this
corner
now
do
deny
me
the
joy
of
taking
you
there
i
guide
you
over
the
strand
and
away
back
of
the
poorhouse
out
at
the
station
and
then
it
just
a
hundred
yards
or
so
it
took
the
combined
efforts
of
jamie
withero
mary
and
me
to
persuade
her
but
she
was
finally
persuaded
and
dressed
in
a
borrowed
black
knitted
cap
and
her
wee
sunday
shawl
she
set
out
with
us
this
is
like
a
weddin
jamie
said
as
he
tied
the
ribbons
under
her
chin
oh
it
worse
dear
it
a
circus
an
wake
in
wan
fur
i
about
dead
an
he
turned
clown
for
a
while
in
five
minutes
everybody
in
entry
heard
the
news
they
stood
at
the
door
waiting
to
have
a
look
matty
mcgrath
came
in
to
see
if
there
was
aanythin
she
could
do
aye
anna
said
smiling
ye
can
go
over
an
tell
oul
ann
agnew
where
i
goin
so
she
wo
worry
herself
t
death
findin
out
she
wo
see
ye
jamie
said
she
see
a
fly
if
it
lit
within
a
hundred
yards
of
her
we
went
down
the
kill
entry
and
over
the
rivulet
we
called
the
strand
there
were
stepping
stones
in
the
water
and
the
passage
was
easy
as
we
crossed
she
said
right
here
was
th
first
place
ye
ever
came
t
see
th
sun
dance
on
water
on
easter
sunday
mornin
we
turned
to
the
right
and
walked
by
the
old
burying
ground
of
the
unitarian
and
past
smith
garden
next
to
garden
was
the
garden
of
a
cooper
i
think
his
name
was
farren
right
here
i
said
is
where
i
commited
my
first
crime
what
was
it
she
asked
stealing
apples
aye
what
a
townful
of
criminals
we
had
then
we
reached
the
back
of
the
poorhouse
james
gardner
was
the
master
of
it
and
goin
t
jamie
gardner
was
understood
as
the
last
march
of
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
antrim
beginning
with
totther
jack
welch
who
was
a
sort
of
pauper
inter
of
the
town
as
we
passed
the
little
graveyard
we
stood
and
looked
over
the
fence
at
the
little
boards
all
of
one
size
and
one
pattern
that
marked
each
grave
god
in
heaven
she
exclaimed
is
it
fearful
not
to
git
rid
of
poverty
even
in
death
i
saw
a
shudder
pass
over
her
face
and
i
turned
mine
away
ten
minutes
later
we
emerged
from
the
fields
at
the
railway
station
you
never
seen
mckillop
the
station
master
have
you
i
asked
no
let
us
wait
here
for
a
minute
we
may
see
him
oh
no
let
hurry
on
t
th
steeple
so
on
we
hurried
it
took
a
good
deal
of
courage
to
enter
when
we
got
there
for
the
round
tower
of
antrim
is
around
it
is
a
stone
wall
enclosing
the
grounds
of
an
estate
the
tower
stands
near
the
house
of
the
owner
and
it
takes
temerity
in
the
poor
to
enter
they
seldom
do
enter
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
they
are
not
particularly
interested
in
archeology
we
timidly
entered
and
walked
up
to
the
tower
so
that
th
steeple
is
it
fine
aye
it
wondtherful
but
wud
it
be
nice
t
take
our
boots
off
jist
walk
aroun
on
this
soft
nice
grass
on
our
bare
feet
the
lawn
was
closely
clipped
and
as
level
as
a
billiard
table
the
trees
were
dressed
in
their
best
summer
clothing
away
in
the
distance
we
caught
glimpses
of
an
abundance
of
flowers
the
air
was
full
of
the
perfume
of
honeysuckle
and
sweet
clover
anna
drank
in
the
scenery
with
almost
childish
delight
d
think
heaven
will
be
as
nice
she
asked
maybe
if
it
is
we
will
take
our
boots
off
an
sit
down
wo
we
and
she
laughed
like
a
girl
if
there
are
boots
in
the
next
world
i
said
there
will
be
cobblers
and
you
would
want
our
old
man
to
be
a
cobbler
to
all
eternity
you
right
she
said
nor
afther
spending
years
here
without
bein
able
to
take
my
boots
off
an
walk
on
a
nice
lawn
like
this
wud
i
care
to
spend
eternity
without
that
joy
do
we
miss
what
we
never
had
aye
we
do
i
miss
most
what
i
never
had
what
for
instance
oh
i
tell
ye
th
night
when
we
alone
we
walked
around
the
tower
and
ventured
once
beneath
the
branches
of
a
big
tree
if
we
lived
here
d
know
what
i
like
t
do
no
jist
take
our
boots
off
an
play
hide
and
go
seek
wud
it
be
fun
i
laughed
loudly
whisht
she
said
they
catch
us
if
you
make
a
noise
you
seem
bent
on
getting
your
boots
off
i
said
laughingly
her
reply
struck
me
dumb
honey
she
said
so
softly
and
looking
into
my
eyes
do
ye
realize
that
i
have
never
stood
on
a
patch
of
lawn
in
my
life
before
hand
in
hand
we
walked
toward
the
gate
taking
an
occasional
wistful
glance
back
at
the
glory
of
the
few
and
thinking
both
of
us
of
the
millions
of
tired
feet
that
never
felt
the
softness
of
a
smooth
green
sward
at
eight
that
night
the
door
was
shut
jamie
tacked
several
copies
of
the
over
the
window
and
we
were
alone
we
talked
of
old
times
we
brought
back
the
dead
and
smiled
or
sighed
over
them
old
tales
of
the
winter
nights
of
long
ago
were
retold
with
a
new
interest
the
town
clock
struck
nine
we
sat
in
silence
as
we
used
to
sit
while
another
sexton
tolled
off
the
days
of
the
month
after
the
ringing
of
the
curfew
many
th
time
ye
home
at
th
sound
of
that
bell
she
said
yes
because
the
sound
of
the
bell
was
always
accompanied
by
a
vision
of
a
wet
welt
hanging
over
the
edge
of
the
tub
jamie
laughed
and
became
reminiscent
d
mind
what
ye
said
wan
time
whin
i
bate
ye
wi
th
stirrup
no
but
i
used
to
think
a
good
deal
more
than
i
said
aye
but
wan
time
i
laid
ye
across
m
knee
an
give
ye
a
good
shtrappin
then
stud
ye
up
an
says
i
hurts
me
worse
than
it
hurts
ye
ye
divil
says
you
it
diz
hurt
ye
in
th
same
place
i
do
remember
but
from
time
immemorial
boys
have
thought
and
said
the
same
thing
d
mind
when
bate
ye
anna
asked
with
a
smile
yes
i
remember
you
solemnly
promised
jamie
you
would
punish
me
and
when
he
went
down
to
barney
you
took
a
long
straw
and
lashed
me
fearfully
with
it
the
town
clock
struck
ten
mary
who
had
sat
silent
all
evening
kissed
us
all
good
night
and
went
to
bed
i
was
at
the
point
of
departure
for
the
new
world
jamie
wanted
to
know
what
i
was
going
to
do
i
outlined
an
ambition
but
its
outworking
was
a
problem
it
was
beyond
his
ken
he
could
not
take
in
the
scope
of
it
anna
could
for
she
had
it
from
the
day
she
first
felt
the
movement
of
life
in
me
it
was
unpretentious
nothing
the
world
would
call
great
och
maan
but
that
wud
be
th
proud
day
fur
anna
if
ye
cud
do
it
when
the
town
clock
struck
eleven
anna
trembled
yer
cowld
anna
he
said
i
put
on
a
few
more
turf
there
plenty
on
dear
i
not
cold
in
my
body
acushla
m
oul
hide
like
a
buffalo
or
i
see
that
ye
want
yerself
i
off
t
bed
we
sat
in
silence
gazing
into
the
peat
fire
memory
led
me
back
down
the
road
to
yesterday
she
was
out
in
the
future
and
wandering
in
an
unknown
continent
with
only
hope
to
guide
her
yet
we
must
get
together
and
that
quickly
minutes
are
like
fine
gold
now
she
said
an
my
tongue
seems
glued
but
i
jist
must
spake
we
have
plenty
of
time
mother
plenty
she
exclaimed
every
clang
of
th
town
clock
is
a
knife
cuttin
th
cords
wan
afther
another
that
bind
me
t
ye
i
want
to
know
about
your
hope
your
outlook
your
religion
i
said
th
biggest
hope
i
ever
had
was
t
bear
a
chile
that
would
love
everybody
as
yer
father
loved
me
a
sort
of
in
miniature
aye
the
aim
is
high
enough
to
begin
with
not
too
high
and
your
religion
all
in
all
it
bein
kind
an
lovin
kindness
takes
in
god
an
maan
an
pogue
entry
an
th
world
the
town
clock
struck
twelve
each
clang
a
knife
cutting
a
cord
and
each
heavier
and
sharper
than
the
last
each
one
vibrating
tingling
jarring
along
every
nerve
sinew
and
muscle
a
feeling
of
numbness
crept
over
me
that
the
end
of
life
for
me
she
said
slowly
there
was
a
pause
longer
and
more
intense
than
all
the
others
maybe
ye
get
rich
an
forget
yes
i
shall
be
rich
i
shall
be
a
millionaire
a
millionaire
of
love
but
no
one
shall
ever
take
your
place
dear
my
overcoat
served
as
a
pillow
an
old
quilt
made
a
pallet
on
the
hard
floor
i
found
myself
being
pressed
gently
down
from
the
low
creepie
to
the
floor
i
pretended
to
sleep
her
hot
tears
fell
on
my
face
her
dear
fingers
were
run
gently
through
my
hair
she
was
on
her
knees
by
my
side
the
tender
mysticism
of
her
youth
came
back
and
expressed
itself
in
prayer
it
was
interspersed
with
tears
and
ave
maria
when
the
first
streak
of
dawn
penetrated
the
old
window
we
had
our
last
cup
of
tea
together
and
later
when
i
held
her
in
a
long
lingering
embrace
there
were
no
tears
we
had
shed
them
all
in
the
silence
of
the
last
vigil
when
i
was
ready
to
go
she
stood
with
her
arm
on
the
old
yellow
she
was
rigid
and
pale
as
death
but
around
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
there
played
a
smile
there
was
a
look
ineffable
of
maternal
love
we
shall
meet
again
mother
i
said
aye
dearie
i
know
rightly
we
meet
but
ochanee
it
be
out
there
beyond
th
meadows
an
th
clouds
chapter
x
the
empty
corner
when
i
walked
into
pogue
entry
about
fifteen
years
later
it
seemed
like
walking
into
another
world
i
was
a
foreigner
how
quare
ye
spake
jamie
said
and
mary
added
demurely
is
it
quality
ye
are
that
ye
spake
like
it
no
faith
not
at
all
i
said
but
it
the
quality
of
america
that
makes
me
think
of
that
now
she
exclaimed
the
neighbors
came
new
neighbors
a
new
generation
to
most
of
whom
i
was
a
tradition
other
boys
and
girls
had
left
antrim
for
america
scores
of
them
in
the
course
of
the
years
there
was
a
popular
supposition
that
we
all
knew
each
other
ye
see
th
wilson
bhoys
ivery
day
i
bate
hainey
said
no
i
have
never
seen
any
of
them
saints
alive
how
that
because
we
live
three
thousand
miles
apart
aye
well
shure
that
be
quite
a
dandther
it
did
take
ye
long
t
git
a
fortune
did
it
another
asked
i
never
acquired
a
fortune
such
as
you
are
thinking
of
anna
said
ye
wor
rich
anna
was
right
i
am
rich
but
i
was
the
richest
boy
in
antrim
when
i
lived
here
they
looked
dumbfounded
how
that
conner
queried
because
anna
was
my
mother
i
did
want
to
discuss
anna
at
that
time
or
to
that
gathering
so
i
gave
the
conversation
a
sudden
turn
and
diplomatically
led
them
in
another
direction
i
explained
how
much
easier
it
was
for
a
policeman
than
a
minister
to
make
a
fortune
and
most
irishmen
in
america
had
a
special
bias
toward
law
jamie
had
grown
so
deaf
that
he
could
only
hear
when
i
shouted
into
his
ear
visitors
kept
on
coming
until
the
little
house
was
uncomfortably
full
would
it
be
fine
i
shouted
into
jamie
ear
if
billy
or
withero
could
just
drop
in
now
god
save
us
all
he
said
th
oul
days
an
oul
faces
are
gone
foriver
after
some
hours
of
entertainment
the
uninvited
guests
were
invited
to
go
home
i
pulled
jamie
old
tub
out
into
the
center
of
the
floor
and
taking
my
coat
off
said
gently
now
good
neighbors
i
have
traveled
a
long
distance
and
need
a
bath
and
if
you
do
mind
i
have
one
at
once
they
took
it
quite
seriously
and
went
home
quickly
as
soon
as
the
house
was
cleared
i
shut
and
barred
the
door
and
mary
and
i
proceeded
to
prepare
the
evening
meal
i
brought
over
the
table
and
put
it
in
its
place
near
the
fire
in
looking
over
the
old
dresser
i
noticed
several
additions
to
the
inventory
i
knew
the
same
old
plates
were
there
many
of
them
broken
and
arranged
to
appear
whole
all
holes
gashes
dents
and
cracks
were
turned
back
or
down
to
deceive
the
beholder
there
were
few
whole
pieces
on
the
dresser
great
guns
mary
i
exclaimed
here
are
two
new
plates
and
a
new
cup
well
well
and
you
never
said
a
word
in
any
of
your
letters
about
them
ye
need
get
huffed
if
we
do
tell
ye
all
the
startlin
things
mary
said
ah
i
exclaimed
there
cup
i
took
the
precious
thing
from
the
shelf
the
handle
was
gone
there
was
a
gash
at
the
lip
and
a
few
new
cracks
circling
around
the
one
i
was
familiar
with
twenty
years
previously
what
visions
of
the
past
came
to
me
in
front
of
that
old
dresser
how
often
in
the
long
ago
she
had
pushed
that
old
cup
gently
toward
me
along
the
edge
of
the
table
gently
to
escape
notice
and
avoid
jealousy
always
at
the
bottom
of
it
a
teaspoonful
of
tea
and
beneath
the
tea
a
of
sugar
each
fairy
picture
of
straggling
tea
leaves
was
our
moving
picture
show
of
those
old
days
we
all
had
tea
leaves
but
she
had
imagination
how
we
laughed
and
sighed
and
swithered
over
the
fortunes
spread
out
all
over
the
inner
surface
of
that
cup
if
ye
stand
there
affrontin
our
poor
oul
delf
all
night
we
wo
haave
aany
tea
at
all
mary
said
the
humor
had
gone
from
my
face
and
speech
from
my
tongue
i
felt
as
one
feels
when
he
looks
for
the
last
time
upon
the
face
of
his
best
friend
mary
laughed
when
i
laid
the
old
cup
on
a
comparatively
new
saucer
at
my
place
there
was
another
laugh
when
i
laid
it
out
for
customs
inspection
in
the
port
of
new
york
i
had
a
set
of
rather
delicate
coffee
cups
one
bore
the
arms
of
coventry
in
colors
another
had
the
seal
of
john
college
oxford
one
was
from
edinburgh
and
another
from
paris
they
looked
aristocratic
i
laid
them
out
in
a
row
and
at
the
end
of
the
row
sat
the
proletarian
forlorn
and
battered
anna
old
what
did
you
pay
for
this
asked
the
inspector
as
he
touched
it
contemptuously
with
his
official
toe
never
mind
what
i
paid
for
it
i
replied
it
valued
at
a
million
dollars
the
officer
laughed
and
i
think
the
other
cups
laughed
also
but
they
were
not
contemptuous
they
were
simply
jealous
leisurely
i
went
over
the
dresser
noting
the
new
chips
and
cracks
handling
them
maybe
fondling
some
of
them
and
putting
them
as
i
found
them
i
jist
take
a
cup
o
tay
jamie
said
i
not
feelin
fine
i
had
less
appetite
than
he
had
and
mary
had
less
than
either
of
us
so
we
sipped
our
tea
for
awhile
in
silence
she
did
stay
long
afther
ye
left
jamie
said
without
looking
up
turning
to
mary
he
continued
how
long
was
it
aanyway
mary
jist
a
wee
while
aye
i
know
it
was
long
did
she
suffer
much
i
asked
she
did
suffer
aany
at
all
he
said
she
jist
withered
like
laves
on
th
threes
she
jist
hankered
t
go
mary
added
wan
night
whin
mary
was
asleep
jamie
continued
she
read
over
again
yer
letther
th
wan
where

much
about

i
said
i
had
just

missionary
to
a
place
called

bowery
in

york
and
i
wrote
her
that
i
was
no

plowman
but

of

maan
if

i
says
she

but

superstitions
ov

somethin
in
that

i
whin

says
she
i

i
she
smiled
like

a
pretty
big
library
says
i
haave
aany
doubt

anna
there
was
a
loud
knock
at
the
door

mary
said
he
put
his
hand
behind
his
ear
and
asked
eagerly
what
is
somebody
dundtherin
let
thim
go
t
h
he
said
angrily
th
tuk
frum
anna
last
time
th
wo
take
frum
me
an
you
mary
another
and
louder
knock
it
misthress
healy
came
a
voice
again
his
hand
was
behind
his
ear
the
name
was
repeated
to
him
misthress
healy
is
it
well
i
do
care
a
d
n
if
it
was
misthress
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
my
sister
has
occupied
my
but
it
was
vacant
that
night
she
sat
on
my
side
of
the
fire
he
and
i
sat
opposite
each
other
at
the
table
i
on
the
same
spot
on
the
same
stool
where
i
used
to
sit
when
her
cup
toward
the
close
of
the
meal
came
traveling
along
the
edge
of
the
table
and
where
her
hand
with
a
crust
in
it
would
sometimes
blindly
grope
for
mine
but
she
was
not
there
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
seen
a
space
so
empty
my
father
was
a
peasant
with
all
the
mental
and
physical
characteristics
of
his
class
my
sister
is
a
peasant
woman
who
has
been
cursed
with
the
same
grinding
poverty
that
cursed
my
mother
life
about
my
mother
there
was
a
subtlety
of
intellect
and
a
spiritual
quality
that
even
in
my
ignorance
was
fascinating
to
me
i
returned
equipped
to
appreciate
it
and
she
was
gone
gone
and
a
wide
gulf
lay
between
those
left
behind
a
gulf
bridged
by
the
relation
we
have
to
the
absent
one
more
than
by
the
relation
we
bore
to
each
other
we
felt
as
keenly
as
others
the
kinship
of
the
flesh
but
there
are
kinships
transcendentally
higher
nobler
and
of
a
purer
nature
than
the
nexus
of
the
flesh
there
were
things
to
say
that
had
to
be
left
unsaid
they
had
not
traveled
that
way
the
language
of
my
experience
would
have
been
a
foreign
tongue
to
them
would
have
understood
wan
night

a
caress
aye
i
know
rightly
but
ye

i
mane
no

i

but
you
remember
when
used
that
word
every
letter
in
it
was
dressed
in
its
best
sunday
clothes
was
it
och
aye
an
i
thravel
twinty
miles
jist
t
hear
aany
wan
say
it
like
anna
well
i
have
traveled
tens
of
thousands
of
miles
and
i
have
heard
the
greatest
preachers
of
the
age
but
i
never
heard
any
one
pronounce
it
so
beautifully
but
as
i
was
bhoy
i
haave
had
a
rale
good
laugh
since
she
died
haave
i
mary
i
haave
naither
mary
said
aye
but
ye
had
double
throuble
dear
we
never
let
trouble
rob
us
of
laughter
when
i
was
here
because
whin
ye
wor
here
she
was
here
too
in
thim
days
whin
throuble
came
she
tear
it
t
pieces
an
make
fun
ov
aych
piece
begorra
ye
might
glour
an
glunch
but
ye
haave
t
laugh
before
th
finish
shure
ye
wud
the
neighbors
began
to
knock
again
some
of
the
knocks
were
vocal
and
as
plain
as
language
some
of
the
more
familiar
gaped
in
the
window
hes
he
hed
bath
yit
asked
mcgrath
the
ragman
we
opened
the
door
and
in
marched
the
inhabitants
of
our
vicinity
for
the
second
crack
this
right
of
mine
own
people
to
come
and
go
as
they
pleased
suggested
to
me
the
thought
that
if
i
wanted
to
have
a
private
conversation
with
my
father
i
would
have
to
take
him
to
another
town
the
following
day
we
went
to
the
churchyard
together
jamie
and
i
over
her
grave
he
had
dragged
a
rough
boulder
and
on
it
in
a
straggling
unsteady
amateur
hand
were
painted
her
initials
and
below
them
his
own
he
was
unable
to
speak
there
and
maybe
it
was
just
as
well
i
knew
everything
he
wanted
to
say
it
was
written
on
his
deeply
furrowed
face
i
took
his
arm
and
led
him
away
our
next
call
was
at
willie
withero
there
when
i
remembered
the
nights
that
i
passed
in
my
new
world
of
starched
linen
too
good
to
shoulder
a
bundle
of
his
old
hammers
i
was
filled
with
remorse
i
uncovered
my
head
and
in
an
undertone
muttered
god
forgive
me
great
oul
bhoy
was
willie
he
said
aye
och
thim
wor
purty
nice
times
whin
he
come
in
o
nights
an
him
anna
wud
argie
but
they
gone
clane
gone
an
i
soon
be
thim
i
bade
farewell
to
mary
and
took
him
to
belfast
for
a
private
talk
every
day
for
a
week
we
went
out
to
the
cave
hill
to
a
wild
and
lonely
spot
where
i
had
a
radius
of
a
mile
for
the
sound
of
my
voice
the
thing
of
all
things
that
i
wanted
him
to
know
was
that
in
america
i
had
been
engaged
in
the
same
fight
with
poverty
that
they
were
familiar
with
at
home
it
was
hard
for
him
to
think
of
a
wolf
of
hunger
at
the
door
of
any
home
beyond
the
sea
it
was
astounding
to
him
to
learn
that
around
me
always
there
were
thousands
of
ragged
starving
people
he
just
gaped
and
exclaimed
it
quare
is
it
we
sat
on
the
grass
on
the
hillside
conscious
each
of
us
that
we
were
saying
the
things
one
wants
to
say
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
she
speyed
i
live
t
see

he
said
she
speyed

says
i
he
choked
up
the
next
thought
that
suggested
itself
for
expression
failed
of
utterance
the
deep
furrows
on
his
face
grew
deeper
his
lips
trembled
when
he
could
speak
he
said
my
god
bhoy
we
had
to
beg
a
coffin
t
bury
in
if
i
had
died
at
the
same
time
i
said
they
would
have
had
to
do
the
same
for
me
how
quare
he
said
i
persuaded
him
to
accompany
me
to
one
of
the
largest
churches
in
belfast
i
was
to
preach
there
that
was
more
than
he
expected
and
the
joy
of
it
was
overpowering
i
do
not
remember
the
text
nor
could
i
give
at
this
distance
of
time
an
outline
of
the
discourse
it
was
one
of
those
occasions
when
a
man
stands
on
the
borderland
of
another
world
i
felt
distinctly
the
spiritual
guidance
of
an
unseen
hand
i
took
her
theme
and
spoke
more
for
her
approval
than
for
the
approval
of
the
crowd
he
could
not
hear
but
he
listened
with
his
eyes
on
the
street
after
the
service
he
became
oblivious
of
time
and
place
and
people
he
threw
his
long
lean
arms
around
my
neck
and
kissed
me
before
a
crowd
he
hoped
anna
was
around
listening
i
told
him
she
was
and
he
said
he
would
like
to
be
happed
up
beside
her
as
he
had
nothing
further
to
hope
for
in
life
in
fear
and
trembling
he
crossed
the
channel
with
me
in
fear
lest
he
should
die
in
scotland
and
they
would
not
bury
him
in
antrim
churchyard
beside
anna
we
visited
my
brothers
and
sisters
for
several
days
every
day
we
took
long
walks
along
the
country
roads
these
walks
were
full
of
questionings
big
vital
questions
of
life
and
death
and
immorality
they
were
quaintly
put
there
a
lot
of
balderdash
about
another
world
bhoy
on
yer
oath
now
d
think
there
is
wan
i
do
if
there

d
niggardly
wud
he
never
god
is
love
and
love
does
work
that
way
at
the
railway
station
he
was
still
pouring
in
his
questions
d
believe
in
prayer
aye
well
jist
ax
sometimes
that
anna
an
me
be
together
will
ye
aye
a
little
group
of
curious
bystanders
stood
on
the
platform
watching
the
little
trembling
old
man
clinging
to
me
as
the
tendril
of
a
vine
clings
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
we
have
just
one
minute
father
aye
aye
wan
minute
my
god
why
cud
ye
stay
there
are
so
many
voices
calling
me
over
the
sea
aye
that
thrue
he
saw
them
watching
him
and
he
feebly
dragged
me
away
from
the
crowd
he
kissed
me
passionately
again
and
again
on
the
lips
the
whistle
blew
all
aboard
the
guard
shouted
he
clutched
me
tightly
and
clung
to
me
with
the
clutch
of
a
drowning
man
i
had
to
extricate
myself
and
spring
on
board
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
as
the
train
moved
out
despair
and
a
picture
of
death
was
on
his
face
his
lips
were
trembling
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
a
few
months
later
they
lowered
him
to
rest
beside
my
mother
i
want
to
go
back
some
day
and
cover
them
with
a
slab
of
marble
on
which
their
names
will
be
cut
and
these
words
love
is
enough
