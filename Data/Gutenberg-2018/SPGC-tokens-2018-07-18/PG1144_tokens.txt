chapter
i
it
had
occurred
to
her
early
that
in
her
position
that
of
a
young
person
spending
in
framed
and
wired
confinement
the
life
of
a
or
a
magpie
she
should
know
a
great
many
persons
without
their
recognising
the
acquaintance
that
made
it
an
emotion
the
more
lively
though
singularly
rare
and
always
even
then
with
opportunity
still
very
much
smothered
to
see
any
one
come
in
whom
she
knew
outside
as
she
called
it
any
one
who
could
add
anything
to
the
meanness
of
her
function
her
function
was
to
sit
there
with
two
young
men
the
other
telegraphist
and
the
to
mind
the
sounder
which
was
always
going
to
dole
out
stamps
and
weigh
letters
answer
stupid
questions
give
difficult
change
and
more
than
anything
else
count
words
as
numberless
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
the
words
of
the
telegrams
thrust
from
morning
to
night
through
the
gap
left
in
the
high
lattice
across
the
encumbered
shelf
that
her
forearm
ached
with
rubbing
this
transparent
screen
fenced
out
or
fenced
in
according
to
the
side
of
the
narrow
counter
on
which
the
human
lot
was
cast
the
duskiest
corner
of
a
shop
pervaded
not
a
little
in
winter
by
the
poison
of
perpetual
gas
and
at
all
times
by
the
presence
of
hams
cheese
dried
fish
soap
varnish
paraffin
and
other
solids
and
fluids
that
she
came
to
know
perfectly
by
their
smells
without
consenting
to
know
them
by
their
names
the
barrier
that
divided
the
little
from
the
grocery
was
a
frail
structure
of
wood
and
wire
but
the
social
the
professional
separation
was
a
gulf
that
fortune
by
a
stroke
quite
remarkable
had
spared
her
the
necessity
of
contributing
at
all
publicly
to
bridge
when
cocker
young
men
stepped
over
from
behind
the
other
counter
to
change
a
note
and
cocker
situation
with
the
cream
of
the
court
guide
and
the
dearest
furnished
apartments
simpkin
ladle
thrupp
just
round
the
corner
was
so
select
that
his
place
was
quite
pervaded
by
the
crisp
rustle
of
these
emblems
she
pushed
out
the
sovereigns
as
if
the
applicant
were
no
more
to
her
than
one
of
the
momentary
the
practically
featureless
appearances
in
the
great
procession
and
this
perhaps
all
the
more
from
the
very
fact
of
the
connexion
only
recognised
outside
indeed
to
which
she
had
lent
herself
with
ridiculous
inconsequence
she
recognised
the
others
the
less
because
she
had
at
last
so
unreservedly
so
irredeemably
recognised
mudge
however
that
might
be
she
was
a
little
ashamed
of
having
to
admit
to
herself
that
mudge
removal
to
a
higher
sphere
to
a
more
commanding
position
that
is
though
to
a
much
lower
neighbourhood
would
have
been
described
still
better
as
a
luxury
than
as
the
mere
simplification
the
corrected
awkwardness
that
she
contented
herself
with
calling
it
he
had
at
any
rate
ceased
to
be
all
day
long
in
her
eyes
and
this
left
something
a
little
fresh
for
them
to
rest
on
of
a
sunday
during
the
three
months
of
his
happy
survival
at
cocker
after
her
consent
to
their
engagement
she
had
often
asked
herself
what
it
was
marriage
would
be
able
to
add
to
a
familiarity
that
seemed
already
to
have
scraped
the
platter
so
clean
opposite
there
behind
the
counter
of
which
his
superior
stature
his
whiter
apron
his
more
clustering
curls
and
more
present
too
present
had
been
for
a
couple
of
years
the
principal
ornament
he
had
moved
to
and
fro
before
her
as
on
the
small
sanded
floor
of
their
contracted
future
she
was
conscious
now
of
the
improvement
of
not
having
to
take
her
present
and
her
future
at
once
they
were
about
as
much
as
she
could
manage
when
taken
separate
she
had
none
the
less
to
give
her
mind
steadily
to
what
mudge
had
again
written
her
about
the
idea
of
her
applying
for
a
transfer
to
an
office
quite
similar
she
could
yet
hope
for
a
place
in
a
bigger
under
the
very
roof
where
he
was
foreman
so
that
dangled
before
her
every
minute
of
the
day
he
should
see
her
as
he
called
it
hourly
and
in
a
part
the
far
district
where
with
her
mother
she
would
save
on
their
two
rooms
alone
nearly
three
shillings
it
would
be
far
from
dazzling
to
exchange
mayfair
for
chalk
farm
and
it
wore
upon
her
much
that
he
could
never
drop
a
subject
still
it
did
wear
as
things
worn
the
worries
of
the
early
times
of
their
great
misery
her
own
her
mother
and
her
elder
sister
the
last
of
whom
had
succumbed
to
all
but
absolute
want
when
as
conscious
and
incredulous
ladies
suddenly
bereft
betrayed
overwhelmed
they
had
slipped
faster
and
faster
down
the
steep
slope
at
the
bottom
of
which
she
alone
had
rebounded
her
mother
had
never
rebounded
any
more
at
the
bottom
than
on
the
way
had
only
rumbled
and
grumbled
down
and
down
making
in
respect
of
caps
topics
and
habits
no
effort
whatever
which
simply
meant
smelling
much
of
the
time
of
whiskey
chapter
ii
it
was
always
rather
quiet
at
cocker
while
the
contingent
from
and
thrupp
and
all
the
other
great
places
were
at
luncheon
or
as
the
young
men
used
vulgarly
to
say
while
the
animals
were
feeding
she
had
forty
minutes
in
advance
of
this
to
go
home
for
her
own
dinner
and
when
she
came
back
and
one
of
the
young
men
took
his
turn
there
was
often
half
an
hour
during
which
she
could
pull
out
a
bit
of
work
or
a
book
a
book
from
the
place
where
she
borrowed
novels
very
greasy
in
fine
print
and
all
about
fine
folks
at
a
a
day
this
sacred
pause
was
one
of
the
numerous
ways
in
which
the
establishment
kept
its
finger
on
the
pulse
of
fashion
and
fell
into
the
rhythm
of
the
larger
life
it
had
something
to
do
one
day
with
the
particular
flare
of
importance
of
an
arriving
customer
a
lady
whose
meals
were
apparently
irregular
yet
whom
she
was
destined
she
afterwards
found
not
to
forget
the
girl
was
blasee
nothing
could
belong
more
as
she
perfectly
knew
to
the
intense
publicity
of
her
profession
but
she
had
a
whimsical
mind
and
wonderful
nerves
she
was
subject
in
short
to
sudden
flickers
of
antipathy
and
sympathy
red
gleams
in
the
grey
fitful
needs
to
notice
and
to
care
odd
caprices
of
curiosity
she
had
a
friend
who
had
invented
a
new
career
for
women
that
of
being
in
and
out
of
people
houses
to
look
after
the
flowers
jordan
had
a
manner
of
her
own
of
sounding
this
allusion
the
flowers
on
her
lips
were
in
fantastic
places
in
happy
homes
as
usual
as
the
coals
or
the
daily
papers
she
took
charge
of
them
at
any
rate
in
all
the
rooms
at
so
much
a
month
and
people
were
quickly
finding
out
what
it
was
to
make
over
this
strange
burden
of
the
pampered
to
the
widow
of
a
clergyman
the
widow
on
her
side
dilating
on
the
initiations
thus
opened
up
to
her
had
been
splendid
to
her
young
friend
over
the
way
she
was
made
free
of
the
greatest
houses
the
way
especially
when
she
did
the
set
out
so
often
for
twenty
she
felt
that
a
single
step
more
would
transform
her
whole
social
position
on
its
being
asked
of
her
then
if
she
circulated
only
in
a
sort
of
tropical
solitude
with
the
upper
servants
for
picturesque
natives
and
on
her
having
to
assent
to
this
glance
at
her
limitations
she
had
found
a
reply
to
the
girl
invidious
question
you
no
imagination
my
dear
that
was
because
a
door
more
than
half
open
to
the
higher
life
could
be
called
anything
but
a
thin
partition
jordan
imagination
quite
did
away
with
the
thickness
our
young
lady
had
not
taken
up
the
charge
had
dealt
with
it
just
because
she
knew
so
well
what
to
think
of
it
it
was
at
once
one
of
her
most
cherished
complaints
and
most
secret
supports
that
people
did
understand
her
and
it
was
accordingly
a
matter
of
indifference
to
her
that
jordan
should
even
though
jordan
handed
down
from
their
early
twilight
of
gentility
and
also
the
victim
of
reverses
was
the
only
member
of
her
circle
in
whom
she
recognised
an
equal
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
her
imaginative
life
was
the
life
in
which
she
spent
most
of
her
time
and
she
would
have
been
ready
had
it
been
at
all
worth
while
to
contend
that
since
her
outward
occupation
did
kill
it
it
must
be
strong
indeed
combinations
of
flowers
and
forsooth
what
could
handle
freely
she
said
to
herself
was
combinations
of
men
and
women
the
only
weakness
in
her
faculty
came
from
the
positive
abundance
of
her
contact
with
the
human
herd
this
was
so
constant
it
had
so
the
effect
of
cheapening
her
privilege
that
there
were
long
stretches
in
which
inspiration
divination
and
interest
quite
dropped
the
great
thing
was
the
flashes
the
quick
revivals
absolute
accidents
all
and
neither
to
be
counted
on
nor
to
be
resisted
some
one
had
only
sometimes
to
put
in
a
penny
for
a
stamp
and
the
whole
thing
was
upon
her
she
was
so
absurdly
constructed
that
these
were
literally
the
moments
that
made
up
made
up
for
the
long
stiffness
of
sitting
there
in
the
stocks
made
up
for
the
cunning
hostility
of
buckton
and
the
importunate
sympathy
of
the
made
up
for
the
daily
deadly
flourishy
letter
from
mudge
made
up
even
for
the
most
haunting
of
her
worries
the
rage
at
moments
of
not
knowing
how
her
mother
did
get
it
she
had
surrendered
herself
moreover
of
late
to
a
certain
expansion
of
her
consciousness
something
that
seemed
perhaps
vulgarly
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
as
the
blast
of
the
season
roared
louder
and
the
waves
of
fashion
tossed
their
spray
further
over
the
counter
there
were
more
impressions
to
be
gathered
and
really
for
it
came
to
that
more
life
to
be
led
definite
at
any
rate
it
was
that
by
the
time
may
was
well
started
the
kind
of
company
she
kept
at
cocker
had
begun
to
strike
her
as
a
reason
a
reason
she
might
almost
put
forward
for
a
policy
of
procrastination
it
sounded
silly
of
course
as
yet
to
plead
such
a
motive
especially
as
the
fascination
of
the
place
was
after
all
a
sort
of
torment
but
she
liked
her
torment
it
was
a
torment
she
should
miss
at
chalk
farm
she
was
ingenious
and
uncandid
therefore
about
leaving
the
breadth
of
london
a
little
longer
between
herself
and
that
austerity
if
she
had
quite
the
courage
in
short
to
say
to
mudge
that
her
actual
chance
for
a
play
of
mind
was
worth
any
week
the
three
shillings
he
desired
to
help
her
to
save
she
yet
saw
something
happen
in
the
course
of
the
month
that
in
her
heart
of
hearts
at
least
answered
the
subtle
question
this
was
connected
precisely
with
the
appearance
of
the
memorable
lady
chapter
iii
she
pushed
in
three
bescribbled
forms
which
the
girl
hand
was
quick
to
appropriate
buckton
having
so
frequent
a
perverse
instinct
for
catching
first
any
eye
that
promised
the
sort
of
entertainment
with
which
she
had
her
peculiar
affinity
the
amusements
of
captives
are
full
of
a
desperate
contrivance
and
one
of
our
young
friend
had
been
the
charming
tale
of
picciola
it
was
of
course
the
law
of
the
place
that
they
were
never
to
take
no
notice
as
buckton
said
whom
they
served
but
this
also
never
prevented
certainly
on
the
same
gentleman
own
part
what
he
was
fond
of
describing
as
the
underhand
game
both
her
companions
for
that
matter
made
no
secret
of
the
number
of
favourites
they
had
among
the
ladies
sweet
familiarities
in
spite
of
which
she
had
repeatedly
caught
each
of
them
in
stupidities
and
mistakes
confusions
of
identity
and
lapses
of
observation
that
never
failed
to
remind
her
how
the
cleverness
of
men
ends
where
the
cleverness
of
women
begins

mary
was
very
handsome
the
handsomest
woman
she
felt
in
a
moment
she
had
ever
seen
or
perhaps
it
was
only
cissy
perhaps
it
was
both
for
she
had
seen
stranger
things
than
that
ladies
wiring
to
different
persons
under
different
names
she
had
seen
all
sorts
of
things
and
pieced
together
all
sorts
of
mysteries
there
had
once
been
one
not
long
before
who
without
winking
sent
off
five
over
five
different
signatures
perhaps
these
represented
five
different
friends
who
had
asked
her
all
women
just
as
perhaps
now
mary
and
cissy
or
one
or
other
of
them
were
wiring
by
deputy
sometimes
she
put
in
too
much
too
much
of
her
own
sense
sometimes
she
put
in
too
little
and
in
either
case
this
often
came
round
to
her
afterwards
for
she
had
an
extraordinary
way
of
keeping
clues
when
she
noticed
she
noticed
that
was
what
it
came
to
there
were
days
and
days
there
were
weeks
sometimes
of
vacancy
this
arose
often
from
buckton
devilish
and
successful
subterfuges
for
keeping
her
at
the
sounder
whenever
it
looked
as
if
anything
might
arouse
the
sounder
which
it
was
equally
his
business
to
mind
being
the
innermost
cell
of
captivity
a
cage
within
the
cage
fenced
oft
from
the
rest
by
a
frame
of
ground
glass
the
would
have
played
into
her
hands
but
the
was
really
reduced
to
idiocy
by
the
effect
of
his
passion
for
her
she
flattered
herself
moreover
nobly
that
with
the
unpleasant
conspicuity
of
this
passion
she
would
never
have
consented
to
be
obliged
to
him
the
most
she
would
ever
do
would
be
always
to
shove
off
on
him
whenever
she
could
the
registration
of
letters
a
job
she
happened
particularly
to
loathe
after
the
long
stupors
at
all
events
there
almost
always
suddenly
would
come
a
sharp
taste
of
something
it
was
in
her
mouth
before
she
knew
it
it
was
in
her
mouth
now
to
cissy
to
mary
whichever
it
was
she
found
her
curiosity
going
out
with
a
rush
a
mute
effusion
that
floated
back
to
her
like
a
returning
tide
the
living
colour
and
splendour
of
the
beautiful
head
the
light
of
eyes
that
seemed
to
reflect
such
utterly
other
things
than
the
mean
things
actually
before
them
and
above
all
the
high
curt
consideration
of
a
manner
that
even
at
bad
moments
was
a
magnificent
habit
and
of
the
very
essence
of
the
innumerable
things
her
beauty
her
birth
her
father
and
mother
her
cousins
and
all
her
ancestors
that
its
possessor
could
have
got
rid
of
even
had
she
wished
how
did
our
obscure
little
public
servant
know
that
for
the
lady
of
the
telegrams
this
was
a
bad
moment
how
did
she
guess
all
sorts
of
impossible
things
such
as
almost
on
the
very
spot
the
presence
of
drama
at
a
critical
stage
and
the
nature
of
the
tie
with
the
gentleman
at
the
hotel
brighton
more
than
ever
before
it
floated
to
her
through
the
bars
of
the
cage
that
this
at
last
was
the
high
reality
the
bristling
truth
that
she
had
hitherto
only
patched
up
and
eked
out
one
of
the
creatures
in
fine
in
whom
all
the
conditions
for
happiness
actually
met
and
who
in
the
air
they
made
bloomed
with
an
unwitting
insolence
what
came
home
to
the
girl
was
the
way
the
insolence
was
tempered
by
something
that
was
equally
a
part
of
the
distinguished
life
the
custom
of
a
flowerlike
bend
to
the
less
fortunate
a
dropped
fragrance
a
mere
quick
breath
but
which
in
fact
pervaded
and
lingered
the
apparition
was
very
young
but
certainly
married
and
our
fatigued
friend
had
a
sufficient
store
of
mythological
comparison
to
recognise
the
port
of
juno
marguerite
might
be
awful
but
she
knew
how
to
dress
a
goddess
pearls
and
spanish
lace
she
herself
with
assurance
could
see
them
and
the
full
length
too
and
also
red
velvet
bows
which
disposed
on
the
lace
in
a
particular
manner
she
could
have
placed
them
with
the
turn
of
a
hand
were
of
course
to
adorn
the
front
of
a
black
brocade
that
would
be
like
a
dress
in
a
picture
however
neither
marguerite
nor
lady
agnes
nor
haddon
nor
fritz
nor
gussy
was
what
the
wearer
of
this
garment
had
really
come
in
for
she
had
come
in
for
everard
and
that
was
doubtless
not
his
true
name
either
if
our
young
lady
had
never
taken
such
jumps
before
it
was
simply
that
she
had
never
before
been
so
affected
she
went
all
the
way
mary
and
cissy
had
been
round
together
in
their
single
superb
person
to
see
him
he
must
live
round
the
corner
they
had
found
that
in
consequence
of
something
they
had
come
precisely
to
make
up
for
or
to
have
another
scene
about
he
had
gone
off
gone
off
just
on
purpose
to
make
them
feel
it
on
which
they
had
come
together
to
as
to
the
nearest
place
where
they
had
put
in
the
three
forms
partly
in
order
not
to
put
in
the
one
alone
the
two
others
in
a
manner
covered
it
muffled
it
passed
it
off
oh
yes
she
went
all
the
way
and
this
was
a
specimen
of
how
she
often
went
she
would
know
the
hand
again
any
time
it
was
as
handsome
and
as
everything
else
as
the
woman
herself
the
woman
herself
had
on
learning
his
flight
pushed
past
servant
and
into
his
room
she
had
written
her
missive
at
his
table
and
with
his
pen
all
this
every
inch
of
it
came
in
the
waft
that
she
blew
through
and
left
behind
her
the
influence
that
as
i
have
said
lingered
and
among
the
things
the
girl
was
sure
of
happily
was
that
she
should
see
her
again
chapter
iv
she
saw
her
in
fact
and
only
ten
days
later
but
this
time
not
alone
and
that
was
exactly
a
part
of
the
luck
of
it
not
unaware
as
how
could
her
observation
have
left
her
so
of
the
possibilities
through
which
it
could
range
our
young
lady
had
ever
since
had
in
her
mind
a
dozen
conflicting
theories
about
everard
type
as
to
which
the
instant
they
came
into
the
place
she
felt
the
point
settled
with
a
thump
that
seemed
somehow
addressed
straight
to
her
heart
that
organ
literally
beat
faster
at
the
approach
of
the
gentleman
who
was
this
time
with
cissy
and
who
as
seen
from
within
the
cage
became
on
the
spot
the
happiest
of
the
happy
circumstances
with
which
her
mind
had
invested
the
friend
of
fritz
and
gussy
he
was
a
very
happy
circumstance
indeed
as
with
his
cigarette
in
his
lips
and
his
broken
familiar
talk
caught
by
his
companion
he
put
down
the
telegrams
it
would
take
them
together
several
minutes
to
dispatch
and
here
it
occurred
oddly
enough
that
if
shortly
before
the
girl
interest
in
his
companion
had
sharpened
her
sense
for
the
messages
then
transmitted
her
immediate
vision
of
himself
had
the
effect
while
she
counted
his
seventy
words
of
preventing
intelligibility
his
words
were
mere
numbers
they
told
her
nothing
whatever
and
after
he
had
gone
she
was
in
possession
of
no
name
of
no
address
of
no
meaning
of
nothing
but
a
vague
sweet
sound
and
an
immense
impression
he
had
been
there
but
five
minutes
he
had
smoked
in
her
face
and
busy
with
his
telegrams
with
the
tapping
pencil
and
the
conscious
danger
the
odious
betrayal
that
would
come
from
a
mistake
she
had
had
no
wandering
glances
nor
roundabout
arts
to
spare
yet
she
had
taken
him
in
she
knew
everything
she
had
made
up
her
mind
he
had
come
back
from
paris
everything
was
the
pair
were
again
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
their
high
encounter
with
life
their
large
and
complicated
game
the
fine
soundless
pulse
of
this
game
was
in
the
air
for
our
young
woman
while
they
remained
in
the
shop
while
they
remained
they
remained
all
day
their
presence
continued
and
abode
with
her
was
in
everything
she
did
till
nightfall
in
the
thousands
of
other
words
she
counted
she
transmitted
in
all
the
stamps
she
detached
and
the
letters
she
weighed
and
the
change
she
gave
equally
unconscious
and
unerring
in
each
of
these
particulars
and
not
as
the
run
on
the
little
office
thickened
with
the
afternoon
hours
looking
up
at
a
single
ugly
face
in
the
long
sequence
nor
really
hearing
the
stupid
questions
that
she
patiently
and
perfectly
answered
all
patience
was
possible
now
all
questions
were
stupid
after
his
all
faces
were
ugly
she
had
been
sure
she
should
see
the
lady
again
and
even
now
she
should
perhaps
she
should
probably
see
her
often
but
for
him
it
was
totally
different
she
should
never
never
see
him
she
wanted
it
too
much
there
was
a
kind
of
wanting
that
helped
she
had
arrived
with
her
rich
experience
at
that
generalisation
and
there
was
another
kind
that
was
fatal
it
was
this
time
the
fatal
kind
it
would
prevent
well
she
saw
him
the
very
next
day
and
on
this
second
occasion
it
was
quite
different
the
sense
of
every
syllable
he
paid
for
was
fiercely
distinct
she
indeed
felt
her
progressive
pencil
dabbing
as
if
with
a
quick
caress
the
marks
of
his
own
put
life
into
every
stroke
he
was
there
a
long
time
had
not
brought
his
forms
filled
out
but
worked
them
off
in
a
nook
on
the
counter
and
there
were
other
people
as
well
a
changing
pushing
cluster
with
every
one
to
mind
at
once
and
endless
right
change
to
make
and
information
to
produce
but
she
kept
hold
of
him
throughout
she
continued
for
herself
in
a
relation
with
him
as
close
as
that
in
which
behind
the
hated
ground
glass
buckton
luckily
continued
with
the
sounder
this
morning
everything
changed
but
rather
to
dreariness
she
had
to
swallow
the
rebuff
to
her
theory
about
fatal
desires
which
she
did
without
confusion
and
indeed
with
absolute
levity
yet
if
it
was
now
flagrant
that
he
did
live
close
at
hand
at
park
chambers
and
belonged
supremely
to
the
class
that
wired
everything
even
their
expensive
feelings
so
that
as
he
never
wrote
his
correspondence
cost
him
weekly
pounds
and
pounds
and
he
might
be
in
and
out
five
times
a
day
there
was
all
the
same
involved
in
the
prospect
and
by
reason
of
its
positive
excess
of
light
a
perverse
melancholy
a
gratuitous
misery
this
was
at
once
to
give
it
a
place
in
an
order
of
feelings
on
which
i
shall
presently
touch
meanwhile
for
a
month
he
was
very
constant
cissy
mary
never
with
him
he
was
always
either
alone
or
accompanied
only
by
some
gentleman
who
was
lost
in
the
blaze
of
his
glory
there
was
another
sense
however
and
indeed
there
was
more
than
one
in
which
she
mostly
found
herself
counting
in
the
splendid
creature
with
whom
she
had
originally
connected
him
he
addressed
this
correspondent
neither
as
mary
nor
as
cissy
but
the
girl
was
sure
of
whom
it
was
in
eaten
square
that
he
was
perpetually
wiring
to
and
all
so
irreproachably
as
lady
bradeen
lady
bradeen
was
cissy
lady
bradeen
was
mary
lady
bradeen
was
the
friend
of
fritz
and
of
gussy
the
customer
of
marguerite
and
the
close
ally
in
short
as
was
ideally
right
only
the
girl
had
not
yet
found
a
descriptive
term
that
was
of
the
most
magnificent
of
men
nothing
could
equal
the
frequency
and
variety
of
his
communications
to
her
ladyship
but
their
extraordinary
their
abysmal
propriety
it
was
just
the
talk
so
profuse
sometimes
that
she
wondered
what
was
left
for
their
real
meetings
of
the
very
happiest
people
their
real
meetings
must
have
been
constant
for
half
of
it
was
appointments
and
allusions
all
swimming
in
a
sea
of
other
allusions
still
tangled
in
a
complexity
of
questions
that
gave
a
wondrous
image
of
their
life
if
lady
bradeen
was
juno
it
was
all
certainly
olympian
if
the
girl
missing
the
answers
her
ladyship
own
outpourings
vainly
reflected
that
should
have
been
one
of
the
bigger
offices
where
telegrams
arrived
as
well
as
departed
there
were
yet
ways
in
which
on
the
whole
she
pressed
the
romance
closer
by
reason
of
the
very
quantity
of
imagination
it
demanded
and
consumed
the
days
and
hours
of
this
new
friend
as
she
came
to
account
him
were
at
all
events
unrolled
and
however
much
more
she
might
have
known
she
would
still
have
wished
to
go
beyond
in
fact
she
did
go
beyond
she
went
quite
far
enough
but
she
could
none
the
less
even
after
a
month
scarce
have
told
if
the
gentlemen
who
came
in
with
him
recurred
or
changed
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
too
were
always
posting
and
wiring
smoking
in
her
face
and
signing
or
not
signing
the
gentlemen
who
came
in
with
him
were
nothing
when
he
was
there
they
turned
up
alone
at
other
times
then
only
perhaps
with
a
dim
richness
of
reference
he
himself
absent
as
well
as
present
was
all
he
was
very
tall
very
fair
and
had
in
spite
of
his
thick
preoccupations
a
that
was
exquisite
particularly
as
it
so
often
had
the
effect
of
keeping
him
on
he
could
have
reached
over
anybody
and
anybody
no
matter
who
would
have
let
him
but
he
was
so
extraordinarily
kind
that
he
quite
pathetically
waited
never
waggling
things
at
her
out
of
his
turn
nor
saying
here
with
horrid
sharpness
he
waited
for
pottering
old
ladies
for
gaping
slaveys
for
the
perpetual
buttonses
from
thrupp
and
the
thing
in
all
this
that
she
would
have
liked
most
unspeakably
to
put
to
the
test
was
the
possibility
of
her
having
for
him
a
personal
identity
that
might
in
a
particular
way
appeal
there
were
moments
when
he
actually
struck
her
as
on
her
side
as
arranging
to
help
to
support
to
spare
her
but
such
was
the
singular
spirit
of
our
young
friend
that
she
could
remind
herself
with
a
pang
that
when
people
had
awfully
good
manners
people
of
that
class
you
could
tell
these
manners
were
for
everybody
and
it
might
be
drearily
unavailing
for
any
poor
particular
body
to
be
overworked
and
unusual
what
he
did
take
for
granted
was
all
sorts
of
facility
and
his
high
pleasantness
his
relighting
of
cigarettes
while
he
waited
his
unconscious
bestowal
of
opportunities
of
boons
of
blessings
were
all
a
part
of
his
splendid
security
the
instinct
that
told
him
there
was
nothing
such
an
existence
as
his
could
ever
lose
by
he
was
somehow
all
at
once
very
bright
and
very
grave
very
young
and
immensely
complete
and
whatever
he
was
at
any
moment
it
was
always
as
much
as
all
the
rest
the
mere
bloom
of
his
beatitude
he
was
sometimes
everard
as
he
had
been
at
the
hotel
brighton
and
he
was
sometimes
captain
everard
he
was
sometimes
philip
with
his
surname
and
sometimes
philip
without
it
in
some
directions
he
was
merely
phil
in
others
he
was
merely
captain
there
were
relations
in
which
he
was
none
of
these
things
but
a
quite
different
person
the
count
there
were
several
friends
for
whom
he
was
william
there
were
several
for
whom
in
allusion
perhaps
to
his
complexion
he
was
the
pink
once
once
only
by
good
luck
he
had
coinciding
comically
quite
miraculously
with
another
person
also
near
to
her
been
mudge
yes
whatever
he
was
it
was
a
part
of
his
happiness
whatever
he
was
and
probably
whatever
he
was
and
his
happiness
was
a
part
it
became
so
little
by
little
of
something
that
almost
from
the
first
of
her
being
at
cocker
had
been
deeply
with
the
girl
chapter
v
this
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
queer
extension
of
her
experience
the
double
life
that
in
the
cage
she
grew
at
last
to
lead
as
the
weeks
went
on
there
she
lived
more
and
more
into
the
world
of
whiffs
and
glimpses
she
found
her
divinations
work
faster
and
stretch
further
it
was
a
prodigious
view
as
the
pressure
heightened
a
panorama
fed
with
facts
and
figures
flushed
with
a
torrent
of
colour
and
accompanied
with
wondrous
what
it
mainly
came
to
at
this
period
was
a
picture
of
how
london
could
amuse
itself
and
that
with
the
running
commentary
of
a
witness
so
exclusively
a
witness
turned
for
the
most
part
to
a
hardening
of
the
heart
the
nose
of
this
observer
was
brushed
by
the
bouquet
yet
she
could
never
really
pluck
even
a
daisy
what
could
still
remain
fresh
in
her
daily
grind
was
the
immense
disparity
the
difference
and
contrast
from
class
to
class
of
every
instant
and
every
motion
there
were
times
when
all
the
wires
in
the
country
seemed
to
start
from
the
little
where
she
plied
for
a
livelihood
and
where
in
the
shuffle
of
feet
the
flutter
of
forms
the
straying
of
stamps
and
the
ring
of
change
over
the
counter
the
people
she
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
remembering
and
fitting
together
with
others
and
of
having
her
theories
and
interpretations
of
kept
up
before
her
their
long
procession
and
rotation
what
twisted
the
knife
in
her
vitals
was
the
way
the
profligate
rich
scattered
about
them
in
extravagant
chatter
over
their
extravagant
pleasures
and
sins
an
amount
of
money
that
would
have
held
the
stricken
household
of
her
frightened
childhood
her
poor
pinched
mother
and
tormented
father
and
lost
brother
and
starved
sister
together
for
a
lifetime
during
her
first
weeks
she
had
often
gasped
at
the
sums
people
were
willing
to
pay
for
the
stuff
they
transmitted
the
much
love
s
the
awful
regrets
the
compliments
and
wonderments
and
vain
vague
gestures
that
cost
the
price
of
a
new
pair
of
boots
she
had
had
a
way
then
of
glancing
at
the
people
faces
but
she
had
early
learnt
that
if
you
became
a
telegraphist
you
soon
ceased
to
be
astonished
her
eye
for
types
amounted
nevertheless
to
genius
and
there
were
those
she
liked
and
those
she
hated
her
feeling
for
the
latter
of
which
grew
to
a
positive
possession
an
instinct
of
observation
and
detection
there
were
the
brazen
women
as
she
called
them
of
the
higher
and
the
lower
fashion
whose
squanderings
and
graspings
whose
struggles
and
secrets
and
affairs
and
lies
she
tracked
and
stored
up
against
them
till
she
had
at
moments
in
private
a
triumphant
vicious
feeling
of
mastery
and
ease
a
sense
of
carrying
their
silly
guilty
secrets
in
her
pocket
her
small
retentive
brain
and
thereby
knowing
so
much
more
about
them
than
they
suspected
or
would
care
to
think
there
were
those
she
would
have
liked
to
betray
to
trip
up
to
bring
down
with
words
altered
and
fatal
and
all
through
a
personal
hostility
provoked
by
the
lightest
signs
by
their
accidents
of
tone
and
manner
by
the
particular
kind
of
relation
she
always
happened
instantly
to
feel
there
were
impulses
of
various
kinds
alternately
soft
and
severe
to
which
she
was
constitutionally
accessible
and
which
were
determined
by
the
smallest
accidents
she
was
rigid
in
general
on
the
article
of
making
the
public
itself
affix
its
stamps
and
found
a
special
enjoyment
in
dealing
to
that
end
with
some
of
the
ladies
who
were
too
grand
to
touch
them
she
had
thus
a
play
of
refinement
and
subtlety
greater
she
flattered
herself
than
any
of
which
she
could
be
made
the
subject
and
though
most
people
were
too
stupid
to
be
conscious
of
this
it
brought
her
endless
small
consolations
and
revenges
she
recognised
quite
as
much
those
of
her
sex
whom
she
would
have
liked
to
help
to
warn
to
rescue
to
see
more
of
and
that
alternative
as
well
operated
exactly
through
the
hazard
of
personal
sympathy
her
vision
for
silver
threads
and
moonbeams
and
her
gift
for
keeping
the
clues
and
finding
her
way
in
the
tangle
the
moonbeams
and
silver
threads
presented
at
moments
all
the
vision
of
what
poor
might
have
made
of
happiness
blurred
and
blank
as
the
whole
thing
often
inevitably
or
mercifully
became
she
could
still
through
crevices
and
crannies
be
stupefied
especially
by
what
in
spite
of
all
seasoning
touched
the
sorest
place
in
her
consciousness
the
revelation
of
the
golden
shower
flying
about
without
a
gleam
of
gold
for
herself
it
remained
prodigious
to
the
end
the
money
her
fine
friends
were
able
to
spend
to
get
still
more
or
even
to
complain
to
fine
friends
of
their
own
that
they
were
in
want
the
pleasures
they
proposed
were
equalled
only
by
those
they
declined
and
they
made
their
appointments
often
so
expensively
that
she
was
left
wondering
at
the
nature
of
the
delights
to
which
the
mere
approaches
were
so
paved
with
shillings
she
quivered
on
occasion
into
the
perception
of
this
and
that
one
whom
she
would
on
the
chance
have
just
simply
liked
to
her
conceit
her
baffled
vanity
was
possibly
monstrous
she
certainly
often
threw
herself
into
a
defiant
conviction
that
she
would
have
done
the
whole
thing
much
better
but
her
greatest
comfort
mostly
was
her
comparative
vision
of
the
men
by
whom
i
mean
the
unmistakeable
gentlemen
for
she
had
no
interest
in
the
spurious
or
the
shabby
and
no
mercy
at
all
for
the
poor
she
could
have
found
a
sixpence
outside
for
an
appearance
of
want
but
her
fancy
in
some
directions
so
alert
had
never
a
throb
of
response
for
any
sign
of
the
sordid
the
men
she
did
track
moreover
she
tracked
mainly
in
one
relation
the
relation
as
to
which
the
cage
convinced
her
she
believed
more
than
anything
else
could
have
done
that
it
was
quite
the
most
diffused
she
found
her
ladies
in
short
almost
always
in
communication
with
her
gentlemen
and
her
gentlemen
with
her
ladies
and
she
read
into
the
immensity
of
their
intercourse
stories
and
meanings
without
end
incontestably
she
grew
to
think
that
the
men
cut
the
best
figure
and
in
this
particular
as
in
many
others
she
arrived
at
a
philosophy
of
her
own
all
made
up
of
her
private
notations
and
cynicisms
it
was
a
striking
part
of
the
business
for
example
that
it
was
much
more
the
women
on
the
whole
who
were
after
the
men
than
the
men
who
were
after
the
women
it
was
literally
visible
that
the
general
attitude
of
the
one
sex
was
that
of
the
object
pursued
and
defensive
apologetic
and
attenuating
while
the
light
of
her
own
nature
helped
her
more
or
less
to
conclude
as
to
the
attitude
of
the
other
perhaps
she
herself
a
little
even
fell
into
the
custom
of
pursuit
in
occasionally
deviating
only
for
gentlemen
from
her
high
rigour
about
the
stamps
she
had
early
in
the
day
made
up
her
mind
in
fine
that
they
had
the
best
manners
and
if
there
were
none
of
them
she
noticed
when
captain
everard
was
there
there
were
plenty
she
could
place
and
trace
and
name
at
other
times
plenty
who
with
their
way
of
being
nice
to
her
and
of
handling
as
if
their
pockets
were
private
tills
loose
mixed
masses
of
silver
and
gold
were
such
pleasant
appearances
that
she
could
envy
them
without
dislike
never
had
to
give
change
they
only
had
to
get
it
they
ranged
through
every
suggestion
every
shade
of
fortune
which
evidently
included
indeed
lots
of
bad
luck
as
well
as
of
good
declining
even
toward
mudge
and
his
bland
firm
thrift
and
ascending
in
wild
signals
and
almost
to
within
hail
of
her
highest
standard
so
from
month
to
month
she
went
on
with
them
all
through
a
thousand
ups
and
downs
and
a
thousand
pangs
and
indifferences
what
virtually
happened
was
that
in
the
shuffling
herd
that
passed
before
her
by
far
the
greater
part
only
passed
a
proportion
but
just
appreciable
stayed
most
of
the
elements
swam
straight
away
lost
themselves
in
the
bottomless
common
and
by
so
doing
really
kept
the
page
clear
on
the
clearness
therefore
what
she
did
retain
stood
sharply
out
she
nipped
and
caught
it
turned
it
over
and
interwove
it
chapter
vi
she
met
jordan
when
she
could
and
learned
from
her
more
and
more
how
the
great
people
under
her
gentle
shake
and
after
going
through
everything
with
the
mere
shops
were
waking
up
to
the
gain
of
putting
into
the
hands
of
a
person
of
real
refinement
the
question
that
the
people
spoke
of
so
vulgarly
as
that
of
the
floral
decorations
the
regular
dealers
in
these
decorations
were
all
very
well
but
there
was
a
peculiar
magic
in
the
play
of
taste
of
a
lady
who
had
only
to
remember
through
whatever
intervening
dusk
all
her
own
little
tables
little
bowls
and
little
jars
and
little
other
arrangements
and
the
wonderful
thing
she
had
made
of
the
garden
of
the
vicarage
this
small
domain
which
her
young
friend
had
never
seen
bloomed
in
jordan
discourse
like
a
new
eden
and
she
converted
the
past
into
a
bank
of
violets
by
the
tone
in
which
she
said
of
course
you
always
knew
my
one
passion
she
obviously
met
now
at
any
rate
a
big
contemporary
need
measured
what
it
was
rapidly
becoming
for
people
to
feel
they
could
trust
her
without
a
tremor
it
brought
them
a
peace
that
during
the
quarter
of
an
hour
before
dinner
in
especial
was
worth
more
to
them
than
mere
payment
could
express
mere
payment
none
the
less
was
tolerably
prompt
she
engaged
by
the
month
taking
over
the
whole
thing
and
there
was
an
evening
on
which
in
respect
to
our
heroine
she
at
last
returned
to
the
charge
it
growing
and
growing
and
i
see
that
i
must
really
divide
the
work
one
wants
an
associate
of
one
own
kind
do
you
know
you
know
the
look
they
want
it
all
to
have
of
having
come
not
from
a
florist
but
from
one
of
themselves
well
i
sure
could
give
it
because
you
one
then
we
win
therefore
just
come
in
with
me
and
leave
the
let
the
simply
bring
you
your
letters
it
would
bring
you
lots
you
see
orders
after
a
bit
by
the
score
it
was
on
this
in
due
course
that
the
great
advantage
again
came
up
one
seems
to
live
again
with
one
own
people
it
had
taken
some
little
time
after
their
having
parted
company
in
the
tempest
of
their
troubles
and
then
in
the
glimmering
dawn
finally
sighted
each
other
again
for
each
to
admit
that
the
other
was
in
her
private
circle
her
only
equal
but
the
admission
came
when
it
did
come
with
an
honest
groan
and
since
equality
was
named
each
found
much
personal
profit
in
exaggerating
the
original
grandeur
jordan
was
ten
years
the
older
but
her
young
friend
was
struck
with
the
smaller
difference
this
now
made
it
had
counted
otherwise
at
the
time
when
much
more
as
a
friend
of
her
mother
the
bereaved
lady
without
a
penny
of
provision
and
with
stopgaps
like
their
own
all
gone
had
across
the
sordid
landing
on
which
the
opposite
doors
of
the
pair
of
scared
miseries
opened
and
to
which
they
were
bewilderedly
bolted
borrowed
coals
and
umbrellas
that
were
repaid
in
potatoes
and
it
had
been
a
questionable
help
at
that
time
to
ladies
submerged
floundering
panting
swimming
for
their
lives
that
they
were
ladies
but
such
an
advantage
could
come
up
again
in
proportion
as
others
vanished
and
it
had
grown
very
great
by
the
time
it
was
the
only
ghost
of
one
they
possessed
they
had
literally
watched
it
take
to
itself
a
portion
of
the
substance
of
each
that
had
departed
and
it
became
prodigious
now
when
they
could
talk
of
it
together
when
they
could
look
back
at
it
across
a
desert
of
accepted
derogation
and
when
above
all
they
could
together
work
up
a
credulity
about
it
that
neither
could
otherwise
work
up
nothing
was
really
so
marked
as
that
they
felt
the
need
to
cultivate
this
legend
much
more
after
having
found
their
feet
and
stayed
their
stomachs
in
the
ultimate
obscure
than
they
had
done
in
the
upper
air
of
mere
frequent
shocks
the
thing
they
could
now
oftenest
say
to
each
other
was
that
they
knew
what
they
meant
and
the
sentiment
with
which
all
round
they
knew
it
was
known
had
amounted
to
a
promise
not
again
to
fall
apart
jordan
was
at
present
fairly
dazzling
on
the
subject
of
the
way
that
in
the
practice
of
her
fairy
art
as
she
called
it
she
more
than
peeped
in
she
penetrated
there
was
not
a
house
of
the
great
kind
and
it
was
of
course
only
a
question
of
those
real
homes
of
luxury
in
which
she
was
not
at
the
rate
such
people
now
had
things
all
over
the
place
the
girl
felt
before
the
picture
the
cold
breath
of
disinheritance
as
much
as
she
had
ever
felt
it
in
the
cage
she
knew
moreover
how
much
she
betrayed
this
for
the
experience
of
poverty
had
begun
in
her
life
too
early
and
her
ignorance
of
the
requirements
of
homes
of
luxury
had
grown
with
other
active
knowledge
a
depth
of
simplification
she
had
accordingly
at
first
often
found
that
in
these
colloquies
she
could
only
pretend
she
understood
educated
as
she
had
rapidly
been
by
her
chances
at
cocker
there
were
still
strange
gaps
in
her
learning
she
could
never
like
jordan
have
found
her
way
about
one
of
the
homes
little
by
little
however
she
had
caught
on
above
all
in
the
light
of
what
jordan
redemption
had
materially
made
of
that
lady
giving
her
though
the
years
and
the
struggles
had
naturally
not
straightened
a
feature
an
almost
air
there
were
women
in
and
out
of
cocker
who
were
quite
nice
and
who
yet
did
look
well
whereas
jordan
looked
well
and
yet
with
her
extraordinarily
protrusive
teeth
was
by
no
means
quite
nice
it
would
seem
mystifyingly
that
it
might
really
come
from
all
the
greatness
she
could
live
with
it
was
fine
to
hear
her
talk
so
often
of
dinners
of
twenty
and
of
her
doing
as
she
said
exactly
as
she
liked
with
them
she
spoke
as
if
for
that
matter
she
invited
the
company
they
simply
give
me
the
table
all
the
rest
all
the
other
effects
come
afterwards
chapter
vii
then
you
see
them
the
girl
again
asked
jordan
hesitated
and
indeed
the
point
had
been
ambiguous
before
do
you
mean
the
guests
her
young
friend
cautious
about
an
undue
exposure
of
innocence
was
not
quite
sure
well
the
people
who
live
there
lady
ventnor
bubb
lord
rye
dear
yes
why
they
one
but
does
one
personally
them
our
young
lady
went
on
since
that
was
the
way
to
speak
i
mean
socially
do
you
know
as
you
know
they
not
so
nice
as
you
jordan
charmingly
cried
but
i
see
more
and
more
of
them
ah
this
was
the
old
story
but
how
soon
why
almost
any
day
of
course
jordan
honestly
added
nearly
always
out
then
why
do
they
want
flowers
all
over
oh
that
does
make
any
difference
jordan
was
not
philosophic
she
was
just
evidently
determined
it
make
any
awfully
interested
in
my
ideas
and
it
inevitable
they
should
meet
me
over
them
her
interlocutress
was
sturdy
enough
what
do
you
call
your
ideas
jordan
reply
was
fine
if
you
were
to
see
me
some
day
with
a
thousand
tulips
you
discover
a
thousand
the
girl
gaped
at
such
a
revelation
of
the
scale
of
it
she
felt
for
the
instant
fairly
planted
out
well
but
if
in
fact
they
never
do
meet
you
she
none
the
less
pessimistically
insisted
never
they
do
and
evidently
quite
on
purpose
we
have
grand
long
talks
there
was
something
in
our
young
lady
that
could
still
stay
her
from
asking
for
a
personal
description
of
these
apparitions
that
showed
too
starved
a
state
but
while
she
considered
she
took
in
afresh
the
whole
of
the
clergyman
widow
jordan
could
help
her
teeth
and
her
sleeves
were
a
distinct
rise
in
the
world
a
thousand
tulips
at
a
shilling
clearly
took
one
further
than
a
thousand
words
at
a
penny
and
the
betrothed
of
mudge
in
whom
the
sense
of
the
race
for
life
was
always
acute
found
herself
wondering
with
a
twinge
of
her
easy
jealousy
if
it
might
after
all
then
for
also
be
better
better
than
where
she
was
to
follow
some
such
scent
where
she
was
was
where
buckton
elbow
could
freely
enter
her
right
side
and
the
clerk
breathing
he
had
something
the
matter
with
his
nose
pervade
her
left
ear
it
was
something
to
fill
an
office
under
government
and
she
knew
but
too
well
there
were
places
commoner
still
than
cocker
but
it
needed
no
great
range
of
taste
to
bring
home
to
her
the
picture
of
servitude
and
promiscuity
she
could
but
offer
to
the
eye
of
comparative
freedom
she
was
so
boxed
up
with
her
young
men
and
anything
like
a
margin
so
absent
that
it
needed
more
art
than
she
should
ever
possess
to
pretend
in
the
least
to
compass
with
any
one
in
the
nature
of
an
acquaintance
say
with
jordan
herself
flying
in
as
it
might
happen
to
wire
sympathetically
to
bubb
an
approach
to
a
relation
of
elegant
privacy
she
remembered
the
day
when
jordan
in
fact
by
the
greatest
chance
come
in
with
words
for
lord
rye
and
a
note
to
change
this
had
been
the
dramatic
manner
of
their
reunion
their
mutual
recognition
was
so
great
an
event
the
girl
could
at
first
only
see
her
from
the
waist
up
besides
making
but
little
of
her
long
telegram
to
his
lordship
it
was
a
strange
whirligig
that
had
converted
the
clergyman
widow
into
such
a
specimen
of
the
class
that
went
beyond
the
sixpence
nothing
of
the
occasion
all
the
more
had
ever
become
dim
least
of
all
the
way
that
as
her
recovered
friend
looked
up
from
counting
jordan
had
just
blown
in
explanation
through
her
teeth
and
through
the
bars
of
the
cage
i
flowers
you
know
our
young
woman
had
always
with
her
little
finger
crooked
out
a
pretty
movement
for
counting
and
she
had
not
forgotten
the
small
secret
advantage
a
sharpness
of
triumph
it
might
even
have
been
called
that
fell
upon
her
at
this
moment
and
avenged
her
for
the
incoherence
of
the
message
an
unintelligible
enumeration
of
numbers
colours
days
hours
the
correspondence
of
people
she
did
know
was
one
thing
but
the
correspondence
of
people
she
did
had
an
aspect
of
its
own
for
her
even
when
she
could
understand
it
the
speech
in
which
jordan
had
defined
a
position
and
announced
a
profession
was
like
a
tinkle
of
bluebells
but
for
herself
her
one
idea
about
flowers
was
that
people
had
them
at
funerals
and
her
present
sole
gleam
of
light
was
that
lords
probably
had
them
most
when
she
watched
a
minute
later
through
the
cage
the
swing
of
her
visitor
departing
petticoats
she
saw
the
sight
from
the
waist
down
and
when
the
after
a
mere
male
glance
remarked
with
an
intention
unmistakeably
low
handsome
woman
she
had
for
him
the
finest
of
her
chills
she
the
widow
of
a
bishop
she
always
felt
with
the
that
it
was
impossible
sufficiently
to
put
it
on
for
what
she
wished
to
express
to
him
was
the
maximum
of
her
contempt
and
that
element
in
her
nature
was
confusedly
stored
a
bishop
was
putting
it
on
but
the
approaches
were
vile
the
night
after
this
when
in
the
fulness
of
time
jordan
mentioned
the
grand
long
talks
the
girl
at
last
brought
out
should
see
them
i
mean
if
i
to
give
up
everything
for
you
jordan
at
this
became
most
arch
i
send
you
to
all
the
bachelors
our
young
lady
could
be
reminded
by
such
a
remark
that
she
usually
struck
her
friend
as
pretty
do
have
their
flowers
oceans
and
they
the
most
particular
oh
it
was
a
wonderful
world
you
should
see
lord
rye
his
flowers
yes
and
his
letters
he
writes
me
pages
on
pages
with
the
most
adorable
little
drawings
and
plans
you
should
see
his
diagrams
chapter
viii
the
girl
had
in
course
of
time
every
opportunity
to
inspect
these
documents
and
they
a
little
disappointed
her
but
in
the
mean
while
there
had
been
more
talk
and
it
had
led
to
her
saying
as
if
her
friend
guarantee
of
a
life
of
elegance
were
not
quite
definite
well
i
see
every
one
at
place
every
one
lots
of
swells
they
flock
they
live
you
know
all
round
and
the
place
is
filled
with
all
the
smart
people
all
the
fast
people
those
whose
names
are
in
the
papers
mamma
has
still
the
morning
post
and
who
come
up
for
the
season
jordan
took
this
in
with
complete
intelligence
yes
and
i
dare
say
it
some
of
your
people
that
do
her
companion
assented
but
discriminated
i
doubt
if
you
them
as
much
as
i
their
affairs
their
appointments
and
arrangements
their
little
games
and
secrets
and
vices
those
things
all
pass
before
me
this
was
a
picture
that
could
make
a
clergyman
widow
not
imperceptibly
gasp
it
was
in
intention
moreover
something
of
a
retort
to
the
thousand
tulips
their
vices
have
they
got
vices
our
young
critic
even
more
overtly
stared
then
with
a
touch
of
contempt
in
her
amusement
have
you
found
out
the
homes
of
luxury
then
had
so
much
to
give
find
out
everything
jordan
at
bottom
a
very
meek
person
was
visibly
struck
i
see
you
do
them
oh
i
do
care
much
good
it
does
me
jordan
after
an
instant
recovered
her
superiority
no
it
lead
to
much
her
own
initiations
so
clearly
did
still
after
all
and
she
was
not
jealous
there
must
be
a
charm
in
seeing
them
at
this
the
girl
suddenly
let
herself
go
i
hate
them
there
that
charm
jordan
gaped
again
the
is
that
what
you
call
bubb
yes
it
comes
to
me
i
had
bubb
i
do
think
she
has
been
in
herself
but
there
are
things
her
maid
has
brought
well
my
dear
and
the
young
person
from
cocker
recalling
these
things
and
summing
them
up
seemed
suddenly
to
have
much
to
say
she
did
say
it
however
she
checked
it
she
only
brought
out
her
maid
who
horrid
must
have
her
then
she
went
on
with
indifference
they
real
they
selfish
brutes
jordan
turning
it
over
adopted
at
last
the
plan
of
treating
it
with
a
smile
she
wished
to
be
liberal
well
of
course
they
do
lay
it
out
they
bore
me
to
death
her
companion
pursued
with
slightly
more
temperance
but
this
was
going
too
far
ah
that
because
you
no
sympathy
the
girl
gave
an
ironic
laugh
only
retorting
that
nobody
could
have
any
who
had
to
count
all
day
all
the
words
in
the
dictionary
a
contention
jordan
quite
granted
the
more
that
she
shuddered
at
the
notion
of
ever
failing
of
the
very
gift
to
which
she
owed
the
vogue
the
rage
she
might
call
it
that
had
caught
her
up
without
sympathy
or
without
imagination
for
it
came
back
again
to
that
how
should
she
get
for
big
dinners
down
the
middle
and
toward
the
far
corners
at
all
it
the
combinations
which
were
easily
managed
the
strain
was
over
the
ineffable
simplicities
those
that
the
bachelors
above
all
and
lord
rye
perhaps
most
of
any
threw
off
just
blew
off
like
such
sketches
of
the
betrothed
of
mudge
at
all
events
accepted
the
explanation
which
had
the
effect
as
almost
any
turn
of
their
talk
was
now
apt
to
have
of
bringing
her
round
to
the
terrific
question
of
that
gentleman
she
was
tormented
with
the
desire
to
get
out
of
jordan
on
this
subject
what
she
was
sure
was
at
the
back
of
jordan
head
and
to
get
it
out
of
her
queerly
enough
if
only
to
vent
a
certain
irritation
at
it
she
knew
that
what
her
friend
would
already
have
risked
if
she
had
been
timid
and
tortuous
was
give
him
up
yes
give
him
up
you
see
that
with
your
sure
chances
you
be
able
to
do
much
better
our
young
woman
had
a
sense
that
if
that
view
could
only
be
put
before
her
with
a
particular
sniff
for
poor
mudge
she
should
hate
it
as
much
as
she
morally
ought
she
was
conscious
of
not
as
yet
hating
it
quite
so
much
as
that
but
she
saw
that
jordan
was
conscious
of
something
too
and
that
there
was
a
degree
of
confidence
she
was
waiting
little
by
little
to
arrive
at
the
day
came
when
the
girl
caught
a
glimpse
of
what
was
still
wanting
to
make
her
friend
feel
strong
which
was
nothing
less
than
the
prospect
of
being
able
to
announce
the
climax
of
sundry
private
dreams
the
associate
of
the
aristocracy
had
personal
calculations
matter
for
brooding
and
dreaming
even
for
peeping
out
not
quite
hopelessly
from
behind
the
of
lonely
lodgings
if
she
did
the
flowers
for
the
bachelors
in
short
did
she
expect
that
to
have
consequences
very
different
from
such
an
outlook
at
cocker
as
she
had
pronounced
wholly
desperate
there
seemed
in
very
truth
something
auspicious
in
the
mixture
of
bachelors
and
flowers
though
when
looked
hard
in
the
eye
jordan
was
not
quite
prepared
to
say
she
had
expected
a
positive
proposal
from
lord
rye
to
pop
out
of
it
our
young
woman
arrived
at
last
none
the
less
at
a
definite
vision
of
what
was
in
her
mind
this
was
a
vivid
foreknowledge
that
the
betrothed
of
mudge
would
unless
conciliated
in
advance
by
a
successful
rescue
almost
hate
her
on
the
day
she
should
break
a
particular
piece
of
news
how
could
that
unfortunate
otherwise
endure
to
hear
of
what
under
the
protection
of
lady
ventnor
was
after
all
so
possible
chapter
ix
meanwhile
since
irritation
sometimes
relieved
her
the
betrothed
of
mudge
found
herself
indebted
to
that
admirer
for
amounts
of
it
perfectly
proportioned
to
her
fidelity
she
always
walked
with
him
on
sundays
usually
in
the
regent
park
and
quite
often
once
or
twice
a
month
he
took
her
in
the
strand
or
thereabouts
to
see
a
piece
that
was
having
a
run
the
productions
he
always
preferred
were
the
really
good
ones
shakespeare
thompson
or
some
funny
american
thing
which
as
it
also
happened
that
she
hated
vulgar
plays
gave
him
ground
for
what
was
almost
the
fondest
of
his
approaches
the
theory
that
their
tastes
were
blissfully
just
the
same
he
was
for
ever
reminding
her
of
that
rejoicing
over
it
and
being
affectionate
and
wise
about
it
there
were
times
when
she
wondered
how
in
the
world
she
could
put
up
with
him
how
she
could
put
up
with
any
man
so
smugly
unconscious
of
the
immensity
of
her
difference
it
was
just
for
this
difference
that
if
she
was
to
be
liked
at
all
she
wanted
to
be
liked
and
if
that
was
not
the
source
of
mudge
admiration
she
asked
herself
what
on
earth
be
she
was
not
different
only
at
one
point
she
was
different
all
round
unless
perhaps
indeed
in
being
practically
human
which
her
mind
just
barely
recognised
that
he
also
was
she
would
have
made
tremendous
concessions
in
other
quarters
there
was
no
limit
for
instance
to
those
she
would
have
made
to
captain
everard
but
what
i
have
named
was
the
most
she
was
prepared
to
do
for
mudge
it
was
because
was
different
that
in
the
oddest
way
she
liked
as
well
as
deplored
him
which
was
after
all
a
proof
that
the
disparity
should
they
frankly
recognise
it
necessarily
be
fatal
she
felt
that
oleaginous
too
oleaginous
as
he
was
he
was
somehow
comparatively
primitive
she
had
once
during
the
portion
of
his
time
at
cocker
that
had
overlapped
her
own
seen
him
collar
a
drunken
soldier
a
big
violent
man
who
having
come
in
with
a
mate
to
get
a
cashed
had
made
a
grab
at
the
money
before
his
friend
could
reach
it
and
had
so
determined
among
the
hams
and
cheeses
and
the
lodgers
from
thrupp
immediate
and
alarming
reprisals
a
scene
of
scandal
and
consternation
buckton
and
the
had
crouched
within
the
cage
but
mudge
had
with
a
very
quiet
but
very
quick
step
round
the
counter
an
air
of
masterful
authority
she
should
soon
forget
triumphantly
interposed
in
the
scrimmage
parted
the
combatants
and
shaken
the
delinquent
in
his
skin
she
had
been
proud
of
him
at
that
moment
and
had
felt
that
if
their
affair
had
not
already
been
settled
the
neatness
of
his
execution
would
have
left
her
without
resistance
their
affair
had
been
settled
by
other
things
by
the
evident
sincerity
of
his
passion
and
by
the
sense
that
his
high
white
apron
resembled
a
front
of
many
floors
it
had
gone
a
great
way
with
her
that
he
would
build
up
a
business
to
his
chin
which
he
carried
quite
in
the
air
this
could
only
be
a
question
of
time
he
would
have
all
piccadilly
in
the
pen
behind
his
ear
that
was
a
merit
in
itself
for
a
girl
who
had
known
what
she
had
known
there
were
hours
at
which
she
even
found
him
though
frankly
there
could
be
no
crown
for
her
effort
to
imagine
on
the
part
of
the
tailor
or
the
barber
some
such
treatment
of
his
appearance
as
would
make
him
resemble
even
remotely
a
man
of
the
world
his
very
beauty
was
the
beauty
of
a
grocer
and
the
finest
future
would
offer
it
none
too
much
room
consistently
to
develop
she
had
engaged
herself
in
short
to
the
perfection
of
a
type
and
almost
anything
square
and
smooth
and
whole
had
its
weight
for
a
person
still
conscious
herself
of
being
a
mere
bruised
fragment
of
wreckage
but
it
contributed
hugely
at
present
to
carry
on
the
two
parallel
lines
of
her
experience
in
the
cage
and
her
experience
out
of
it
after
keeping
quiet
for
some
time
about
this
opposition
she
suddenly
one
sunday
afternoon
on
a
penny
chair
in
the
regent
park
broke
for
him
capriciously
bewilderingly
into
an
intimation
of
what
it
came
to
he
had
naturally
pressed
more
and
more
on
the
point
of
her
again
placing
herself
where
he
could
see
her
hourly
and
for
her
to
recognise
that
she
had
as
yet
given
him
no
sane
reason
for
delay
he
had
small
need
to
describe
himself
as
unable
to
make
out
what
she
was
up
to
as
if
with
her
absurd
bad
reasons
she
could
have
begun
to
tell
him
sometimes
she
thought
it
would
be
amusing
to
let
him
have
them
full
in
the
face
for
she
felt
she
should
die
of
him
unless
she
once
in
a
while
stupefied
him
and
sometimes
she
thought
it
would
be
disgusting
and
perhaps
even
fatal
she
liked
him
however
to
think
her
silly
for
that
gave
her
the
margin
which
at
the
best
she
would
always
require
and
the
only
difficulty
about
this
was
that
he
had
enough
imagination
to
oblige
her
it
produced
none
the
less
something
of
the
desired
effect
to
leave
him
simply
wondering
why
over
the
matter
of
their
reunion
she
did
yield
to
his
arguments
then
at
last
simply
as
if
by
accident
and
out
of
mere
boredom
on
a
day
that
was
rather
flat
she
preposterously
produced
her
own
well
wait
a
bit
where
i
am
i
still
see
things
and
she
talked
to
him
even
worse
if
possible
than
she
had
talked
to
jordan
little
by
little
to
her
own
stupefaction
she
caught
that
he
was
trying
to
take
it
as
she
meant
it
and
that
he
was
neither
astonished
nor
angry
oh
the
british
tradesman
this
gave
her
an
idea
of
his
resources
mudge
would
be
angry
only
with
a
person
who
like
the
drunken
soldier
in
the
shop
should
have
an
unfavourable
effect
on
business
he
seemed
positively
to
enter
for
the
time
and
without
the
faintest
flash
of
irony
or
ripple
of
laughter
into
the
whimsical
grounds
of
her
enjoyment
of
cocker
custom
and
instantly
to
be
casting
up
whatever
it
might
as
jordan
had
said
lead
to
what
he
had
in
mind
was
not
of
course
what
jordan
had
had
it
was
obviously
not
a
source
of
speculation
with
him
that
his
sweetheart
might
pick
up
a
husband
she
could
see
perfectly
that
this
was
not
for
a
moment
even
what
he
supposed
she
herself
dreamed
of
what
she
had
done
was
simply
to
give
his
sensibility
another
push
into
the
dim
vast
of
trade
in
that
direction
it
was
all
alert
and
she
had
whisked
before
it
the
mild
fragrance
of
a
connexion
that
was
the
most
he
could
see
in
any
account
of
her
keeping
in
on
whatever
roundabout
lines
with
the
gentry
and
when
getting
to
the
bottom
of
this
she
quickly
proceeded
to
show
him
the
kind
of
eye
she
turned
on
such
people
and
to
give
him
a
sketch
of
what
that
eye
discovered
she
reduced
him
to
the
particular
prostration
in
which
he
could
still
be
amusing
to
her
chapter
x
they
the
most
awful
wretches
i
assure
you
the
lot
all
about
there
then
why
do
you
want
to
stay
among
them
my
dear
man
just
because
they
it
makes
me
hate
them
so
hate
them
i
thought
you
liked
them
do
be
stupid
what
i
is
just
to
loathe
them
you
believe
what
passes
before
my
eyes
then
why
have
you
never
told
me
you
did
mention
anything
before
i
left
oh
i
had
got
round
to
it
then
it
the
sort
of
thing
you
believe
at
first
you
have
to
look
round
you
a
bit
and
then
you
understand
you
work
into
it
more
and
more
besides
the
girl
went
on
this
is
the
time
of
the
year
when
the
worst
lot
come
up
they
simply
packed
together
in
those
smart
streets
talk
of
the
numbers
of
the
poor
what
can
vouch
for
is
the
numbers
of
the
rich
there
are
new
ones
every
day
and
they
seem
to
get
richer
and
richer
oh
they
do
come
up
she
cried
imitating
for
her
private
recreation
she
was
sure
it
reach
mudge
the
low
intonation
of
the
and
where
do
they
come
from
her
companion
candidly
enquired
she
had
to
think
a
moment
then
she
found
something
from
the
meetings
they
bet
tremendously
well
they
bet
enough
at
chalk
farm
if
that
all
it
all
it
is
a
millionth
part
she
replied
with
some
sharpness
it
immense
fun
she
to
tantalise
him
then
as
she
had
heard
jordan
say
and
as
the
ladies
at
cocker
even
sometimes
wired
it
quite
too
dreadful
she
could
fully
feel
how
it
was
mudge
propriety
which
was
extreme
he
had
a
horror
of
coarseness
and
attended
a
wesleyan
chapel
that
prevented
his
asking
for
details
but
she
gave
him
some
of
the
more
innocuous
in
spite
of
himself
especially
putting
before
him
how
at
simpkin
and
ladle
they
all
made
the
money
fly
that
was
indeed
what
he
liked
to
hear
the
connexion
was
not
direct
but
one
was
somehow
more
in
the
right
place
where
the
money
was
flying
than
where
it
was
simply
and
meagrely
nesting
the
air
felt
that
stir
he
had
to
acknowledge
much
less
at
chalk
farm
than
in
the
district
in
which
his
beloved
so
oddly
enjoyed
her
footing
she
gave
him
she
could
see
a
restless
sense
that
these
might
be
familiarities
not
to
be
sacrificed
germs
possibilities
faint
foreshowings
heaven
knew
what
of
the
initiation
it
would
prove
profitable
to
have
arrived
at
when
in
the
fulness
of
time
he
should
have
his
own
shop
in
some
such
paradise
what
really
touched
him
that
was
discernible
was
that
she
could
feed
him
with
so
much
mere
vividness
of
reminder
keep
before
him
as
by
the
play
of
a
fan
the
very
wind
of
the
swift
and
the
charm
of
the
existence
of
a
class
that
providence
had
raised
up
to
be
the
blessing
of
grocers
he
liked
to
think
that
the
class
was
there
that
it
was
always
there
and
that
she
contributed
in
her
slight
but
appreciable
degree
to
keep
it
up
to
the
mark
he
could
have
formulated
his
theory
of
the
matter
but
the
exuberance
of
the
aristocracy
was
the
advantage
of
trade
and
everything
was
knit
together
in
a
richness
of
pattern
that
it
was
good
to
follow
with
one
it
was
a
comfort
to
him
to
be
thus
assured
that
there
were
no
symptoms
of
a
drop
what
did
the
sounder
as
she
called
it
nimbly
worked
do
but
keep
the
ball
going
what
it
came
to
therefore
for
mudge
was
that
all
enjoyments
were
as
might
be
said
and
that
the
more
people
had
the
more
they
wanted
to
have
the
more
flirtations
as
he
might
roughly
express
it
the
more
cheese
and
pickles
he
had
even
in
his
own
small
way
been
dimly
struck
with
the
linked
sweetness
connecting
the
tender
passion
with
cheap
champagne
or
perhaps
the
other
way
round
what
he
would
have
liked
to
say
had
he
been
able
to
work
out
his
thought
to
the
end
was
i
see
i
see
lash
them
up
then
lead
them
on
keep
them
going
some
of
it
help
some
time
coming
way
yet
he
was
troubled
by
the
suspicion
of
subtleties
on
his
companion
part
that
spoiled
the
straight
view
he
could
understand
people
hating
what
they
liked
or
liking
what
they
hated
above
all
it
hurt
him
somewhere
for
he
had
his
private
delicacies
to
see
anything
money
made
out
of
his
betters
to
be
too
enquiring
or
in
any
other
way
too
free
at
the
expense
of
the
gentry
was
vaguely
wrong
the
only
thing
that
was
distinctly
right
was
to
be
prosperous
at
any
price
was
it
just
because
they
were
up
there
aloft
that
they
were
lucrative
he
concluded
at
any
rate
by
saying
to
his
young
friend
if
it
improper
for
you
to
remain
at
cocker
then
that
falls
in
exactly
with
the
other
reasons
i
put
before
you
for
your
removal
improper
her
smile
became
a
prolonged
boldness
my
dear
boy
there
no
one
like
you
i
dare
say
he
laughed
but
that
does
help
the
question
well
she
returned
i
ca
give
up
my
friends
i
making
even
more
than
mrs
jordan
mudge
considered
how
much
is
making
oh
you
dear
donkey
and
regardless
of
all
the
regent
park
she
patted
his
cheek
this
was
the
sort
of
moment
at
which
she
was
absolutely
tempted
to
tell
him
that
she
liked
to
be
near
park
chambers
there
was
a
fascination
in
the
idea
of
seeing
if
on
a
mention
of
captain
everard
he
would
do
what
she
thought
he
might
would
weigh
against
the
obvious
objection
the
still
more
obvious
advantage
the
advantage
of
course
could
only
strike
him
at
the
best
as
rather
fantastic
but
it
was
always
to
the
good
to
keep
hold
when
you
hold
and
such
an
attitude
would
also
after
all
involve
a
high
tribute
to
her
fidelity
of
one
thing
she
absolutely
never
doubted
mudge
believed
in
her
with
a
belief
she
believed
in
herself
too
for
that
matter
if
there
was
a
thing
in
the
world
no
one
could
charge
her
with
it
was
being
the
kind
of
low
barmaid
person
who
rinsed
tumblers
and
bandied
slang
but
she
forbore
as
yet
to
speak
she
had
not
spoken
even
to
jordan
and
the
hush
that
on
her
lips
surrounded
the
captain
name
maintained
itself
as
a
kind
of
symbol
of
the
success
that
up
to
this
time
had
attended
something
or
other
she
could
have
said
what
that
she
humoured
herself
with
calling
without
words
her
relation
with
him
chapter
xi
she
would
have
admitted
indeed
that
it
consisted
of
little
more
than
the
fact
that
his
absences
however
frequent
and
however
long
always
ended
with
his
turning
up
again
it
was
nobody
business
in
the
world
but
her
own
if
that
fact
continued
to
be
enough
for
her
it
was
of
course
not
enough
just
in
itself
what
it
had
taken
on
to
make
it
so
was
the
extraordinary
possession
of
the
elements
of
his
life
that
memory
and
attention
had
at
last
given
her
there
came
a
day
when
this
possession
on
the
girl
part
actually
seemed
to
enjoy
between
them
while
their
eyes
met
a
tacit
recognition
that
was
half
a
joke
and
half
a
deep
solemnity
he
bade
her
good
morning
always
now
he
often
quite
raised
his
hat
to
her
he
passed
a
remark
when
there
was
time
or
room
and
once
she
went
so
far
as
to
say
to
him
that
she
had
seen
him
for
ages
ages
was
the
word
she
consciously
and
carefully
though
a
trifle
tremulously
used
ages
was
exactly
what
she
meant
to
this
he
replied
in
terms
doubtless
less
anxiously
selected
but
perhaps
on
that
account
not
the
less
remarkable
oh
yes
has
it
been
awfully
wet
that
was
a
specimen
of
their
give
and
take
it
fed
her
fancy
that
no
form
of
intercourse
so
transcendent
and
distilled
had
ever
been
established
on
earth
everything
so
far
as
they
chose
to
consider
it
so
might
mean
almost
anything
the
want
of
margin
in
the
cage
when
he
peeped
through
the
bars
wholly
ceased
to
be
appreciable
it
was
a
drawback
only
in
superficial
commerce
with
captain
everard
she
had
simply
the
margin
of
the
universe
it
may
be
imagined
therefore
how
their
unuttered
reference
to
all
she
knew
about
him
could
in
this
immensity
play
at
its
ease
every
time
he
handed
in
a
telegram
it
was
an
addition
to
her
knowledge
what
did
his
constant
smile
mean
to
mark
if
it
did
mean
to
mark
that
he
never
came
into
the
place
without
saying
to
her
in
this
manner
oh
yes
you
have
me
by
this
time
so
completely
at
your
mercy
that
it
does
in
the
least
matter
what
i
give
you
now
you
become
a
comfort
i
assure
you
she
had
only
two
torments
the
greatest
of
which
was
that
she
could
not
even
once
or
twice
touch
with
him
on
some
individual
fact
she
would
have
given
anything
to
have
been
able
to
allude
to
one
of
his
friends
by
name
to
one
of
his
engagements
by
date
to
one
of
his
difficulties
by
the
solution
she
would
have
given
almost
as
much
for
just
the
right
chance
it
would
have
to
be
tremendously
right
to
show
him
in
some
sharp
sweet
way
that
she
had
perfectly
penetrated
the
greatest
of
these
last
and
now
lived
with
it
in
a
kind
of
heroism
of
sympathy
he
was
in
love
with
a
woman
to
whom
and
to
any
view
of
whom
a
and
especially
one
who
passed
a
life
among
hams
and
cheeses
was
as
the
sand
on
the
floor
and
what
her
dreams
desired
was
the
possibility
of
its
somehow
coming
to
him
that
her
own
interest
in
him
could
take
a
pure
and
noble
account
of
such
an
infatuation
and
even
of
such
an
impropriety
as
yet
however
she
could
only
rub
along
with
the
hope
that
an
accident
sooner
or
later
might
give
her
a
lift
toward
popping
out
with
something
that
would
surprise
and
perhaps
even
some
fine
day
assist
him
what
could
people
mean
moreover
cheaply
sarcastic
people
by
not
feeling
all
that
could
be
got
out
of
the
weather
felt
it
all
and
seemed
literally
to
feel
it
most
when
she
went
quite
wrong
speaking
of
the
stuffy
days
as
cold
of
the
cold
ones
as
stuffy
and
betraying
how
little
she
knew
in
her
cage
of
whether
it
was
foul
or
fair
it
was
for
that
matter
always
stuffy
at
cocker
and
she
finally
settled
down
to
the
safe
proposition
that
the
outside
element
was
changeable
anything
seemed
true
that
made
him
so
radiantly
assent
this
indeed
is
a
small
specimen
of
her
cultivation
of
insidious
ways
of
making
things
easy
for
him
ways
to
which
of
course
she
could
be
at
all
sure
he
did
real
justice
real
justice
was
not
of
this
world
she
had
had
too
often
to
come
back
to
that
yet
strangely
happiness
was
and
her
traps
had
to
be
set
for
it
in
a
manner
to
keep
them
unperceived
by
buckton
and
the
the
most
she
could
hope
for
apart
from
the
question
which
constantly
flickered
up
and
died
down
of
the
divine
chance
of
his
consciously
liking
her
would
be
that
without
analysing
it
he
should
arrive
at
a
vague
sense
that
cocker
was
well
attractive
easier
smoother
sociably
brighter
slightly
more
picturesque
in
short
more
propitious
in
general
to
his
little
affairs
than
any
other
establishment
just
thereabouts
she
was
quite
aware
that
they
could
be
in
so
huddled
a
hole
particularly
quick
but
she
found
her
account
in
the
slowness
she
certainly
could
bear
it
if
could
the
great
pang
was
that
just
thereabouts
were
so
awfully
thick
she
was
always
seeing
him
in
imagination
in
other
places
and
with
other
girls
but
she
would
defy
any
other
girl
to
follow
him
as
she
followed
and
though
they
were
for
so
many
reasons
quick
at
cocker
she
could
hurry
for
him
when
through
an
intimation
light
as
air
she
gathered
that
he
was
pressed
when
hurry
was
better
still
impossible
it
was
because
of
the
pleasantest
thing
of
all
the
particular
element
of
their
contact
she
would
have
called
it
their
friendship
that
consisted
of
an
almost
humorous
treatment
of
the
look
of
some
of
his
words
they
would
never
perhaps
have
grown
half
so
intimate
if
he
had
not
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
formed
some
of
his
letters
with
a
queerness
it
was
positive
that
the
queerness
could
scarce
have
been
greater
if
he
had
practised
it
for
the
very
purpose
of
bringing
their
heads
together
over
it
as
far
as
was
possible
to
heads
on
different
sides
of
a
wire
fence
it
had
taken
her
truly
but
once
or
twice
to
master
these
tricks
but
at
the
cost
of
striking
him
perhaps
as
stupid
she
could
still
challenge
them
when
circumstances
favoured
the
great
circumstance
that
favoured
was
that
she
sometimes
actually
believed
he
knew
she
only
feigned
perplexity
if
he
knew
it
therefore
he
tolerated
it
if
he
tolerated
it
he
came
back
and
if
he
came
back
he
liked
her
this
was
her
seventh
heaven
and
she
did
ask
much
of
his
liking
she
only
asked
of
it
to
reach
the
point
of
his
not
going
away
because
of
her
own
he
had
at
times
to
be
away
for
weeks
he
had
to
lead
lets
life
he
had
to
travel
there
were
places
to
which
he
was
constantly
wiring
for
rooms
all
this
she
granted
him
forgave
him
in
fact
in
the
long
run
literally
blessed
and
thanked
him
for
if
he
had
to
lead
his
life
that
precisely
fostered
his
leading
it
so
much
by
telegraph
therefore
the
benediction
was
to
come
in
when
he
could
that
was
all
she
asked
that
he
should
wholly
deprive
her
sometimes
she
almost
felt
that
he
could
have
deprived
her
even
had
he
been
minded
by
reason
of
the
web
of
revelation
that
was
woven
between
them
she
quite
thrilled
herself
with
thinking
what
with
such
a
lot
of
material
a
bad
girl
would
do
it
would
be
a
scene
better
than
many
in
her
novels
this
going
to
him
in
the
dusk
of
evening
at
park
chambers
and
letting
him
at
last
have
it
i
know
too
much
about
a
certain
person
now
not
to
put
it
to
you
excuse
my
being
so
lurid
that
it
quite
worth
your
while
to
buy
me
off
come
therefore
buy
me
there
was
a
point
indeed
at
which
such
flights
had
to
drop
again
the
point
of
an
unreadiness
to
name
when
it
came
to
that
the
purchasing
medium
it
would
certainly
be
anything
so
gross
as
money
and
the
matter
accordingly
remained
rather
vague
all
the
more
that
was
not
a
bad
girl
it
was
for
any
such
reason
as
might
have
aggravated
a
mere
minx
that
she
often
hoped
he
would
again
bring
cissy
the
difficulty
of
this
however
was
constantly
present
to
her
for
the
kind
of
communion
to
which
cocker
so
richly
ministered
rested
on
the
fact
that
cissy
and
he
were
so
often
in
different
places
she
knew
by
this
time
all
the
places
suchbury
monkhouse
whiteroy
finches
and
even
how
the
parties
on
these
occasions
were
composed
but
her
subtlety
found
ways
to
make
her
knowledge
fairly
protect
and
promote
their
keeping
as
she
had
heard
jordan
say
in
touch
so
when
he
actually
sometimes
smiled
as
if
he
really
felt
the
awkwardness
of
giving
her
again
one
of
the
same
old
addresses
all
her
being
went
out
in
the
desire
which
her
face
must
have
expressed
that
he
should
recognise
her
forbearance
to
criticise
as
one
of
the
finest
tenderest
sacrifices
a
woman
had
ever
made
for
love
chapter
xii
she
was
occasionally
worried
however
this
might
be
by
the
impression
that
these
sacrifices
great
as
they
were
were
nothing
to
those
that
his
own
passion
had
imposed
if
indeed
it
was
not
rather
the
passion
of
his
confederate
which
had
caught
him
up
and
was
whirling
him
round
like
a
great
he
was
at
any
rate
in
the
strong
grip
of
a
dizzy
splendid
fate
the
wild
wind
of
his
life
blew
him
straight
before
it
did
she
catch
in
his
face
at
times
even
through
his
smile
and
his
happy
habit
the
gleam
of
that
pale
glare
with
which
a
bewildered
victim
appeals
as
he
passes
to
some
pair
of
pitying
eyes
he
perhaps
even
himself
know
how
scared
he
was
but
knew
they
were
in
danger
they
were
in
danger
captain
everard
and
lady
bradeen
it
beat
every
novel
in
the
shop
she
thought
of
mudge
and
his
safe
sentiment
she
thought
of
herself
and
blushed
even
more
for
her
tepid
response
to
it
it
was
a
comfort
to
her
at
such
moments
to
feel
that
in
another
relation
a
relation
supplying
that
affinity
with
her
nature
that
mudge
deluded
creature
would
never
supply
she
should
have
been
no
more
tepid
than
her
ladyship
her
deepest
soundings
were
on
two
or
three
occasions
of
finding
herself
almost
sure
that
if
she
dared
her
ladyship
lover
would
have
gathered
relief
from
speaking
to
her
she
literally
fancied
once
or
twice
that
projected
as
he
was
toward
his
doom
her
own
eyes
struck
him
while
the
air
roared
in
his
ears
as
the
one
pitying
pair
in
the
crowd
but
how
could
he
speak
to
her
while
she
sat
sandwiched
there
between
the
and
the
sounder
she
had
long
ago
in
her
comings
and
goings
made
acquaintance
with
park
chambers
and
reflected
as
she
looked
up
at
their
luxurious
front
that
they
of
course
would
supply
the
ideal
setting
for
the
ideal
speech
there
was
not
an
object
in
london
that
before
the
season
was
over
was
more
stamped
upon
her
brain
she
went
roundabout
to
pass
it
for
it
was
not
on
the
short
way
she
passed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
always
looked
up
though
it
had
taken
her
a
long
time
to
be
sure
of
the
particular
set
of
windows
she
had
made
that
out
finally
by
an
act
of
audacity
that
at
the
time
had
almost
stopped
her
and
that
in
retrospect
greatly
quickened
her
blushes
one
evening
she
had
lingered
late
and
watched
watched
for
some
moment
when
the
porter
who
was
in
uniform
and
often
on
the
steps
had
gone
in
with
a
visitor
then
she
followed
boldly
on
the
calculation
that
he
would
have
taken
the
visitor
up
and
that
the
hall
would
be
free
the
hall
free
and
the
electric
light
played
over
the
gilded
and
lettered
board
that
showed
the
names
and
numbers
of
the
occupants
of
the
different
floors
what
she
wanted
looked
straight
at
her
captain
everard
was
on
the
third
it
was
as
if
in
the
immense
intimacy
of
this
they
were
for
the
instant
and
the
first
time
face
to
face
outside
the
cage
alas
they
were
face
to
face
but
a
second
or
two
she
was
whirled
out
on
the
wings
of
a
panic
fear
that
he
might
just
then
be
entering
or
issuing
this
fear
was
indeed
in
her
shameless
deflexions
never
very
far
from
her
and
was
mixed
in
the
oddest
way
with
depressions
and
disappointments
it
was
dreadful
as
she
trembled
by
to
run
the
risk
of
looking
to
him
as
if
she
basely
hung
about
and
yet
it
was
dreadful
to
be
obliged
to
pass
only
at
such
moments
as
put
an
encounter
out
of
the
question
at
the
horrible
hour
of
her
first
coming
to
cocker
he
was
always
it
was
to
be
hoped
snug
in
bed
and
at
the
hour
of
her
final
departure
he
was
of
course
she
had
such
things
all
on
her
dressing
for
dinner
we
may
let
it
pass
that
if
she
could
bring
herself
to
hover
till
he
was
dressed
this
was
simply
because
such
a
process
for
such
a
person
could
only
be
terribly
prolonged
when
she
went
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
her
own
dinner
she
had
too
little
time
to
do
anything
but
go
straight
though
it
must
be
added
that
for
a
real
certainty
she
would
joyously
have
omitted
the
repast
she
had
made
up
her
mind
as
to
there
being
on
the
whole
no
decent
pretext
to
justify
her
flitting
casually
past
at
three
in
the
morning
that
was
the
hour
at
which
if
the
novels
were
not
all
wrong
he
probably
came
home
for
the
night
she
was
therefore
reduced
to
the
vainest
figuration
of
the
miraculous
meeting
toward
which
a
hundred
impossibilities
would
have
to
conspire
but
if
nothing
was
more
impossible
than
the
fact
nothing
was
more
intense
than
the
vision
what
may
not
we
can
only
moralise
take
place
in
the
quickened
muffled
perception
of
a
young
person
with
an
ardent
soul
all
our
humble
friend
native
distinction
her
refinement
of
personal
grain
of
heredity
of
pride
took
refuge
in
this
small
throbbing
spot
for
when
she
was
most
conscious
of
the
objection
of
her
vanity
and
the
pitifulness
of
her
little
flutters
and
manoeuvres
then
the
consolation
and
the
redemption
were
most
sure
to
glow
before
her
in
some
just
discernible
sign
he
did
like
her
chapter
xiii
he
never
brought
cissy
back
but
cissy
came
one
day
without
him
as
fresh
as
before
from
the
hands
of
marguerite
or
only
at
the
season
end
a
trifle
less
fresh
she
was
however
distinctly
less
serene
she
had
brought
nothing
with
her
and
looked
about
with
impatience
for
the
forms
and
the
place
to
write
the
latter
convenience
at
cocker
was
obscure
and
barely
adequate
and
her
clear
voice
had
the
light
note
of
disgust
which
her
lover
never
showed
as
she
responded
with
a
there
of
surprise
to
the
gesture
made
by
the
in
answer
to
her
sharp
question
our
young
friend
was
busy
with
half
a
dozen
people
but
she
had
dispatched
them
in
her
most
businesslike
manner
by
the
time
her
ladyship
flung
through
the
bars
this
light
of
then
the
directness
with
which
the
girl
managed
to
receive
the
accompanying
missive
was
the
result
of
the
concentration
that
had
caused
her
to
make
the
stamps
fly
during
the
few
minutes
occupied
by
the
production
of
it
this
concentration
in
turn
may
be
described
as
the
effect
of
the
apprehension
of
imminent
relief
it
was
nineteen
days
counted
and
checked
off
since
she
had
seen
the
object
of
her
homage
and
as
had
he
been
in
london
she
should
with
his
habits
have
been
sure
to
see
him
often
she
was
now
about
to
learn
what
other
spot
his
presence
might
just
then
happen
to
sanctify
for
she
thought
of
them
the
other
spots
as
ecstatically
conscious
of
it
expressively
happy
in
it
but
gracious
how
handsome
was
her
ladyship
and
what
an
added
price
it
gave
him
that
the
air
of
intimacy
he
threw
out
should
have
flowed
originally
from
such
a
source
the
girl
looked
straight
through
the
cage
at
the
eyes
and
lips
that
must
so
often
have
been
so
near
as
own
looked
at
them
with
a
strange
passion
that
for
an
instant
had
the
result
of
filling
out
some
of
the
gaps
supplying
the
missing
answers
in
his
correspondence
then
as
she
made
out
that
the
features
she
thus
scanned
and
associated
were
totally
unaware
of
it
that
they
glowed
only
with
the
colour
of
quite
other
and
not
at
all
guessable
thoughts
this
directly
added
to
their
splendour
gave
the
girl
the
sharpest
impression
she
had
yet
received
of
the
uplifted
the
unattainable
plains
of
heaven
and
yet
at
the
same
time
caused
her
to
thrill
with
a
sense
of
the
high
company
she
did
somehow
keep
she
was
with
the
absent
through
her
ladyship
and
with
her
ladyship
through
the
absent
the
only
pang
but
it
matter
was
the
proof
in
the
admirable
face
in
the
sightless
preoccupation
of
its
possessor
that
the
latter
had
a
notion
of
her
her
folly
had
gone
to
the
point
of
half
believing
that
the
other
party
to
the
affair
must
sometimes
mention
in
eaton
square
the
extraordinary
little
person
at
the
place
from
which
he
so
often
wired
yet
the
perception
of
her
visitor
blankness
actually
helped
this
extraordinary
little
person
the
next
instant
to
take
refuge
in
a
reflexion
that
could
be
as
proud
as
it
liked
how
little
she
knows
how
little
she
knows
the
girl
cried
to
herself
for
what
did
that
show
after
all
but
that
captain
everard
telegraphic
confidant
was
captain
everard
charming
secret
our
young
friend
perusal
of
her
ladyship
telegram
was
literally
prolonged
by
a
momentary
daze
what
swam
between
her
and
the
words
making
her
see
them
as
through
rippled
shallow
sunshot
water
was
the
great
the
perpetual
flood
of
how
much
know
how
much
know
this
produced
a
delay
in
her
catching
that
on
the
face
these
words
did
give
her
what
she
wanted
though
she
was
prompt
enough
with
her
remembrance
that
her
grasp
was
half
the
time
just
of
what
was
on
the
face

the
girl
slowly
counted
then
he
was
at
ostend
this
hooked
on
with
so
sharp
a
click
that
not
to
feel
she
was
as
quickly
letting
it
all
slip
from
her
she
had
absolutely
to
hold
it
a
minute
longer
and
to
do
something
to
that
end
thus
it
was
that
she
did
on
this
occasion
what
she
never
did
threw
off
a
reply
paid
that
sounded
officious
but
that
she
partly
made
up
for
by
deliberately
affixing
the
stamps
and
by
waiting
till
she
had
done
so
to
give
change
she
had
for
so
much
coolness
the
strength
that
she
considered
she
knew
all
about
miss
dolman
yes
paid
she
saw
all
sorts
of
things
in
this
reply
even
to
a
small
suppressed
start
of
surprise
at
so
correct
an
assumption
even
to
an
attempt
the
next
minute
at
a
fresh
air
of
detachment
how
much
with
the
answer
the
calculation
was
not
abstruse
but
our
intense
observer
required
a
moment
more
to
make
it
and
this
gave
her
ladyship
time
for
a
second
thought
oh
just
wait
the
white
begemmed
hand
bared
to
write
rose
in
sudden
nervousness
to
the
side
of
the
wonderful
face
which
with
eyes
of
anxiety
for
the
paper
on
the
counter
she
brought
closer
to
the
bars
of
the
cage
i
think
i
must
alter
a
word
on
this
she
recovered
her
telegram
and
looked
over
it
again
but
she
had
a
new
an
obvious
trouble
and
studied
it
without
deciding
and
with
much
of
the
effect
of
making
our
young
woman
watch
her
this
personage
meanwhile
at
the
sight
of
her
expression
had
decided
on
the
spot
if
she
had
always
been
sure
they
were
in
danger
her
expression
was
the
best
possible
sign
of
it
there
was
a
word
wrong
but
she
had
lost
the
right
one
and
much
clearly
depended
on
her
finding
it
again
the
girl
therefore
sufficiently
estimating
the
affluence
of
customers
and
the
distraction
of
buckton
and
the
took
the
jump
and
gave
it
is
it
cooper
it
was
as
if
she
had
bodily
leaped
cleared
the
top
of
the
cage
and
alighted
on
her
interlocutress
cooper
the
stare
was
heightened
by
a
blush
yes
she
had
made
juno
blush
this
was
all
the
greater
reason
for
going
on
i
mean
instead
of
burfield
our
young
friend
fairly
pitied
her
she
had
made
her
in
an
instant
so
helpless
and
yet
not
a
bit
haughty
nor
outraged
she
was
only
mystified
and
scared
oh
you
know
yes
i
know
our
young
friend
smiled
meeting
the
other
eyes
and
having
made
juno
blush
proceeded
to
patronise
her
do
it
she
put
out
a
competent
hand
her
ladyship
only
submitted
confused
and
bewildered
all
presence
of
mind
quite
gone
and
the
next
moment
the
telegram
was
in
the
cage
again
and
its
author
out
of
the
shop
then
quickly
boldly
under
all
the
eyes
that
might
have
witnessed
her
tampering
the
extraordinary
little
person
at
cocker
made
the
proper
change
people
were
really
too
giddy
and
if
they
in
a
certain
case
to
be
caught
it
should
be
the
fault
of
her
own
grand
memory
had
it
been
settled
weeks
before
for
miss
dolman
it
was
always
to
be
cooper
chapter
xiv
but
the
summer
holidays
brought
a
marked
difference
they
were
holidays
for
almost
every
one
but
the
animals
in
the
cage
the
august
days
were
flat
and
dry
and
with
so
little
to
feed
it
she
was
conscious
of
the
ebb
of
her
interest
in
the
secrets
of
the
refined
she
was
in
a
position
to
follow
the
refined
to
the
extent
of
knowing
they
had
made
so
many
of
their
arrangements
with
her
aid
exactly
where
they
were
yet
she
felt
quite
as
if
the
panorama
had
ceased
unrolling
and
the
band
stopped
playing
a
stray
member
of
the
latter
occasionally
turned
up
but
the
communications
that
passed
before
her
bore
now
largely
on
rooms
at
hotels
prices
of
furnished
houses
hours
of
trains
dates
of
sailings
and
arrangements
for
being
met
she
found
them
for
the
most
part
prosaic
and
coarse
the
only
thing
was
that
they
brought
into
her
stuffy
corner
as
straight
a
whiff
of
alpine
meadows
and
scotch
moors
as
she
might
hope
ever
to
inhale
there
were
moreover
in
especial
fat
hot
dull
ladies
who
had
out
with
her
to
exasperation
the
terms
for
seaside
lodgings
which
struck
her
as
huge
and
the
matter
of
the
number
of
beds
required
which
was
not
less
portentous
this
in
reference
to
places
of
which
the
names
eastbourne
folkestone
cromer
scarborough
whitby
tormented
her
with
something
of
the
sound
of
the
plash
of
water
that
haunts
the
traveller
in
the
desert
she
had
not
been
out
of
london
for
a
dozen
years
and
the
only
thing
to
give
a
taste
to
the
present
dead
weeks
was
the
spice
of
a
chronic
resentment
the
sparse
customers
the
people
she
did
see
were
the
people
who
were
just
off
off
on
the
decks
of
fluttered
yachts
off
to
the
uttermost
point
of
rocky
headlands
where
the
very
breeze
was
then
playing
for
the
want
of
which
she
said
to
herself
that
she
sickened
there
was
accordingly
a
sense
in
which
at
such
a
period
the
great
differences
of
the
human
condition
could
press
upon
her
more
than
ever
a
circumstance
drawing
fresh
force
in
truth
from
the
very
fact
of
the
chance
that
at
last
for
a
change
did
squarely
meet
her
the
chance
to
be
off
for
a
bit
almost
as
far
as
anybody
they
took
their
turns
in
the
cage
as
they
took
them
both
in
the
shop
and
at
chalk
farm
she
had
known
these
two
months
that
time
was
to
be
allowed
in
september
no
less
than
eleven
days
for
her
personal
private
holiday
much
of
her
recent
intercourse
with
mudge
had
consisted
of
the
hopes
and
fears
expressed
mainly
by
himself
involved
in
the
question
of
their
getting
the
same
dates
a
question
that
in
proportion
as
the
delight
seemed
assured
spread
into
a
sea
of
speculation
over
the
choice
of
where
and
how
all
through
july
on
the
sunday
evenings
and
at
such
other
odd
times
as
he
could
seize
he
had
flooded
their
talk
with
wild
waves
of
calculation
it
was
practically
settled
that
with
her
mother
somewhere
on
the
south
coast
a
phrase
of
which
she
liked
the
sound
they
should
put
in
their
allowance
together
but
she
already
felt
the
prospect
quite
weary
and
worn
with
the
way
he
went
round
and
round
on
it
it
had
become
his
sole
topic
the
theme
alike
of
his
most
solemn
prudences
and
most
placid
jests
to
which
every
opening
led
for
return
and
revision
and
in
which
every
little
flower
of
a
foretaste
was
pulled
up
as
soon
as
planted
he
had
announced
at
the
earliest
day
characterising
the
whole
business
from
that
moment
as
their
plans
under
which
name
he
handled
it
as
a
syndicate
handles
a
chinese
or
other
loan
he
had
promptly
declared
that
the
question
must
be
thoroughly
studied
and
he
produced
on
the
whole
subject
from
day
to
day
an
amount
of
information
that
excited
her
wonder
and
even
not
a
little
as
she
frankly
let
him
know
her
disdain
when
she
thought
of
the
danger
in
which
another
pair
of
lovers
rapturously
lived
she
enquired
of
him
anew
why
he
could
leave
nothing
to
chance
then
she
got
for
answer
that
this
profundity
was
just
his
pride
and
he
pitted
ramsgate
against
bournemouth
and
even
boulogne
against
jersey
for
he
had
great
ideas
with
all
the
mastery
of
detail
that
was
some
day
professionally
to
carry
him
afar
the
longer
the
time
since
she
had
seen
captain
everard
the
more
she
was
booked
as
she
called
it
to
pass
park
chambers
and
this
was
the
sole
amusement
that
in
the
lingering
august
days
and
the
twilights
sadly
drawn
out
it
was
left
her
to
cultivate
she
had
long
since
learned
to
know
it
for
a
feeble
one
though
its
feebleness
was
perhaps
scarce
the
reason
for
her
saying
to
herself
each
evening
as
her
time
for
departure
approached
no
no
not
she
never
failed
of
that
silent
remark
any
more
than
she
failed
of
feeling
in
some
deeper
place
than
she
had
even
yet
fully
sounded
that
one
remarks
were
as
weak
as
straws
and
that
however
one
might
indulge
in
them
at
eight
one
fate
infallibly
declared
itself
in
absolute
indifference
to
them
at
about
remarks
were
remarks
and
very
well
for
that
but
fate
was
fate
and
this
young
lady
was
to
pass
park
chambers
every
night
in
the
working
week
out
of
the
immensity
of
her
knowledge
of
the
life
of
the
world
there
bloomed
on
these
occasions
as
specific
remembrance
that
it
was
regarded
in
that
region
in
august
and

as
rather
pleasant
just
to
be
caught
for
something
or
other
in
passing
through
town
somebody
was
always
passing
and
somebody
might
catch
somebody
else
it
was
in
full
cognisance
of
this
subtle
law
that
she
adhered
to
the
most
ridiculous
circuit
she
could
have
made
to
get
home
one
warm
dull
featureless
friday
when
an
accident
had
made
her
start
from
cocker
a
little
later
than
usual
she
became
aware
that
something
of
which
the
infinite
possibilities
had
for
so
long
peopled
her
dreams
was
at
last
prodigiously
upon
her
though
the
perfection
in
which
the
conditions
happened
to
present
it
was
almost
rich
enough
to
be
but
the
positive
creation
of
a
dream
she
saw
straight
before
her
like
a
vista
painted
in
a
picture
the
empty
street
and
the
lamps
that
burned
pale
in
the
dusk
not
yet
established
it
was
into
the
convenience
of
this
quiet
twilight
that
a
gentleman
on
the
doorstep
of
the
chambers
gazed
with
a
vagueness
that
our
young
lady
little
figure
violently
trembled
in
the
approach
with
the
measure
of
its
power
to
dissipate
everything
indeed
grew
in
a
flash
terrific
and
distinct
her
old
uncertainties
fell
away
from
her
and
since
she
was
so
familiar
with
fate
she
felt
as
if
the
very
nail
that
fixed
it
were
driven
in
by
the
hard
look
with
which
for
a
moment
captain
everard
awaited
her
the
vestibule
was
open
behind
him
and
the
porter
as
absent
as
on
the
day
she
had
peeped
in
he
had
just
come
out
was
in
town
in
a
tweed
suit
and
a
pot
hat
but
between
two
journeys
duly
bored
over
his
evening
and
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
it
then
it
was
that
she
was
glad
she
had
never
met
him
in
that
way
before
she
reaped
with
such
ecstasy
the
benefit
of
his
not
being
able
to
think
she
passed
often
she
jumped
in
two
seconds
to
the
determination
that
he
should
even
suppose
it
to
be
the
very
first
time
and
the
very
oddest
chance
this
was
while
she
still
wondered
if
he
would
identify
or
notice
her
his
original
attention
had
not
she
instinctively
knew
been
for
the
young
woman
at
cocker
it
had
only
been
for
any
young
woman
who
might
advance
to
the
tune
of
her
not
troubling
the
quiet
air
and
in
fact
the
poetic
hour
with
ugliness
ah
but
then
and
just
as
she
had
reached
the
door
came
his
second
observation
a
long
light
reach
with
which
visibly
and
quite
amusedly
he
recalled
and
placed
her
they
were
on
different
sides
but
the
street
narrow
and
still
had
only
made
more
of
a
stage
for
the
small
momentary
drama
it
was
not
over
besides
it
was
far
from
over
even
on
his
sending
across
the
way
with
the
pleasantest
laugh
she
had
ever
heard
a
little
lift
of
his
hat
and
an
oh
good
evening
it
was
still
less
over
on
their
meeting
the
next
minute
though
rather
indirectly
and
awkwardly
in
the
middle
of
the
road
a
situation
to
which
three
or
four
steps
of
her
own
had
unmistakeably
contributed
and
then
passing
not
again
to
the
side
on
which
she
had
arrived
but
back
toward
the
portal
of
park
chambers
i
did
know
you
at
first
are
you
taking
a
walk
ah
i
do
take
walks
at
night
i
going
home
after
my
work
oh
that
was
practically
what
they
had
meanwhile
smiled
out
and
his
exclamation
to
which
for
a
minute
he
appeared
to
have
nothing
to
add
left
them
face
to
face
and
in
just
such
an
attitude
as
for
his
part
he
might
have
worn
had
he
been
wondering
if
he
could
properly
ask
her
to
come
in
during
this
interval
in
fact
she
really
felt
his
question
to
be
just
properly
it
was
simply
a
question
of
the
degree
of
properness
chapter
xv
she
never
knew
afterwards
quite
what
she
had
done
to
settle
it
and
at
the
time
she
only
knew
that
they
presently
moved
with
vagueness
yet
with
continuity
away
from
the
picture
of
the
lighted
vestibule
and
the
quiet
stairs
and
well
up
the
street
together
this
also
must
have
been
in
the
absence
of
a
definite
permission
of
anything
vulgarly
articulate
for
that
matter
on
the
part
of
either
and
it
was
to
be
later
on
a
thing
of
remembrance
and
reflexion
for
her
that
the
limit
of
what
just
here
for
a
longish
minute
passed
between
them
was
his
taking
in
her
thoroughly
successful
deprecation
though
conveyed
without
pride
or
sound
or
touch
of
the
idea
that
she
might
be
out
of
the
cage
the
very
girl
at
large
that
she
hugged
the
theory
she
was
yes
it
was
strange
she
afterwards
thought
that
so
much
could
have
come
and
gone
and
yet
not
disfigured
the
dear
little
intense
crisis
either
with
impertinence
or
with
resentment
with
any
of
the
horrid
notes
of
that
kind
of
acquaintance
he
had
taken
no
liberty
as
she
would
have
so
called
it
and
through
not
having
to
betray
the
sense
of
one
she
herself
had
still
more
charmingly
taken
none
on
the
spot
nevertheless
she
could
speculate
as
to
what
it
meant
that
if
his
relation
with
lady
bradeen
continued
to
be
what
her
mind
had
built
it
up
to
he
should
feel
free
to
proceed
with
marked
independence
this
was
one
of
the
questions
he
was
to
leave
her
to
deal
with
the
question
whether
people
of
his
sort
still
asked
girls
up
to
their
rooms
when
they
were
so
awfully
in
love
with
other
women
could
people
of
his
sort
do
that
without
what
people
of
her
sort
would
call
being
false
to
their
love
she
had
already
a
vision
of
how
the
true
answer
was
that
people
of
her
sort
did
in
such
cases
matter
did
count
as
infidelity
counted
only
as
something
else
she
might
have
been
curious
since
it
came
to
that
to
see
exactly
what
strolling
together
slowly
in
their
summer
twilight
and
their
empty
corner
of
mayfair
they
found
themselves
emerge
at
last
opposite
to
one
of
the
smaller
gates
of
the
park
upon
which
without
any
particular
word
about
it
they
were
talking
so
of
other
things
they
crossed
the
street
and
went
in
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
she
had
gathered
by
this
time
one
magnificent
hope
about
him
the
hope
he
would
say
nothing
vulgar
she
knew
thoroughly
what
she
meant
by
that
she
meant
something
quite
apart
from
any
matter
of
his
being
false
their
bench
was
not
far
within
it
was
near
the
park
lane
paling
and
the
patchy
lamplight
and
the
rumbling
cabs
and
a
strange
emotion
had
come
to
her
and
she
felt
indeed
excitement
within
excitement
above
all
a
conscious
joy
in
testing
him
with
chances
he
did
take
she
had
an
intense
desire
he
should
know
the
type
she
really
conformed
to
without
her
doing
anything
so
low
as
tell
him
and
he
had
surely
begun
to
know
it
from
the
moment
he
seize
the
opportunities
into
which
a
common
man
would
promptly
have
blundered
these
were
on
the
mere
awkward
surface
and
relation
was
beautiful
behind
and
below
them
she
had
questioned
so
little
on
the
way
what
they
might
be
doing
that
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
she
took
straight
hold
of
it
her
hours
her
confinement
the
many
conditions
of
service
in
the
had
with
a
glance
at
his
own
postal
resources
and
alternatives
formed
up
to
this
stage
the
subject
of
their
talk
well
here
we
are
and
it
may
be
right
enough
but
this
is
the
least
you
know
where
i
was
going
you
were
going
home
yes
and
i
was
already
rather
late
i
was
going
to
my
supper
you
have
had
it
no
indeed
then
you
have
eaten
he
looked
of
a
sudden
so
extravagantly
concerned
that
she
laughed
out
all
day
yes
we
do
feed
once
but
that
was
long
ago
so
i
must
presently
say
oh
deary
he
exclaimed
with
an
intonation
so
droll
and
yet
a
touch
so
light
and
a
distress
so
marked
a
confession
of
helplessness
for
such
a
case
in
short
so
unrelieved
that
she
at
once
felt
sure
she
had
made
the
great
difference
plain
he
looked
at
her
with
the
kindest
eyes
and
still
without
saying
what
she
had
known
he
would
she
had
known
he
would
say
then
sup
with
but
the
proof
of
it
made
her
feel
as
if
she
had
feasted
i
not
a
bit
hungry
she
went
on
ah
you
be
awfully
he
made
answer
but
settling
himself
on
the
bench
as
if
after
all
that
need
interfere
with
his
spending
his
evening
i
always
quite
wanted
the
chance
to
thank
you
for
the
trouble
you
so
often
take
for
me
yes
i
know
she
replied
uttering
the
words
with
a
sense
of
the
situation
far
deeper
than
any
pretence
of
not
fitting
his
allusion
she
immediately
felt
him
surprised
and
even
a
little
puzzled
at
her
frank
assent
but
for
herself
the
trouble
she
had
taken
could
only
in
these
fleeting
minutes
they
would
probably
never
come
back
be
all
there
like
a
little
hoard
of
gold
in
her
lap
certainly
he
might
look
at
it
handle
it
take
up
the
pieces
yet
if
he
understood
anything
he
must
understand
all
i
consider
you
already
immensely
thanked
me
the
horror
was
back
upon
her
of
having
seemed
to
hang
about
for
some
reward
awfully
odd
you
should
have
been
there
just
the
one
time
the
one
time
you
passed
my
place
yes
you
can
fancy
i
have
many
minutes
to
waste
there
was
a
place
i
had
to
stop
at
i
see
i
see
he
knew
already
so
much
about
her
work
it
must
be
an
awful
grind
for
a
lady
it
is
but
i
do
think
i
groan
over
it
any
more
than
my
companions
and
you
seen
not
ladies
she
mildly
jested
but
with
an
intention
one
gets
used
to
things
and
there
are
employments
i
should
have
hated
much
more
she
had
the
finest
conception
of
the
beauty
of
not
at
least
boring
him
to
whine
to
count
up
her
wrongs
was
what
a
barmaid
or
a
would
do
and
it
was
quite
enough
to
sit
there
like
one
of
these
if
you
had
had
another
employment
he
remarked
after
a
moment
we
might
never
have
become
acquainted
it
highly
probable
and
certainly
not
in
the
same
way
then
still
with
her
heap
of
gold
in
her
lap
and
something
of
the
pride
of
it
in
her
manner
of
holding
her
head
she
continued
not
to
move
she
only
smiled
at
him
the
evening
had
thickened
now
the
scattered
lamps
were
red
the
park
all
before
them
was
full
of
obscure
and
ambiguous
life
there
were
other
couples
on
other
benches
whom
it
was
impossible
not
to
see
yet
at
whom
it
was
impossible
to
look
but
i
walked
so
much
out
of
my
way
with
you
only
just
to
show
you
that
that
with
this
she
paused
it
was
not
after
all
so
easy
to
express
that
anything
you
may
have
thought
is
perfectly
true
oh
i
thought
a
tremendous
lot
her
companion
laughed
do
you
mind
my
smoking
why
should
i
you
always
smoke
at
your
place
oh
yes
but
here
it
different
no
she
said
as
he
lighted
a
cigarette
that
just
what
it
is
it
quite
the
same
well
then
that
because
it
so
wonderful
then
you
conscious
of
how
wonderful
it
is
she
returned
he
jerked
his
handsome
head
in
literal
protest
at
a
doubt
why
exactly
what
i
mean
by
my
gratitude
for
all
your
trouble
it
has
been
just
as
if
you
took
a
particular
interest
she
only
looked
at
him
by
way
of
answer
in
such
sudden
headlong
embarrassment
as
she
was
quite
aware
that
while
she
remained
silent
he
showed
himself
checked
by
her
expression
you
have
you
taken
a
particular
interest
oh
a
particular
interest
she
quavered
out
feeling
the
whole
thing
her
headlong
embarrassment
get
terribly
the
better
of
her
and
wishing
with
a
sudden
scare
all
the
more
to
keep
her
emotion
down
she
maintained
her
fixed
smile
a
moment
and
turned
her
eyes
over
the
peopled
darkness
unconfused
now
because
there
was
something
much
more
confusing
this
with
a
fatal
great
rush
was
simply
the
fact
that
they
were
thus
together
they
were
near
near
and
all
she
had
imagined
of
that
had
only
become
more
true
more
dreadful
and
overwhelming
she
stared
straight
away
in
silence
till
she
felt
she
looked
an
idiot
then
to
say
something
to
say
nothing
she
attempted
a
sound
which
ended
in
a
flood
of
tears
chapter
xvi
her
tears
helped
her
really
to
dissimulate
for
she
had
instantly
in
so
public
a
situation
to
recover
herself
they
had
come
and
gone
in
half
a
minute
and
she
immediately
explained
them
it
only
because
tired
it
that
it
that
then
she
added
a
trifle
incoherently
i
shall
never
see
you
again
ah
but
why
not
the
mere
tone
in
which
her
companion
asked
this
satisfied
her
once
for
all
as
to
the
amount
of
imagination
for
which
she
could
count
on
him
it
was
naturally
not
large
it
had
exhausted
itself
in
having
arrived
at
what
he
had
already
touched
upon
the
sense
of
an
intention
in
her
poor
zeal
at
cocker
but
any
deficiency
of
this
kind
was
no
fault
in
him
he
was
obliged
to
have
an
inferior
cleverness
to
have
resources
and
virtues
it
had
been
as
if
he
almost
really
believed
she
had
simply
cried
for
fatigue
and
he
accordingly
put
in
some
kind
confused
plea
you
ought
really
to
take
something
you
have
something
or
other
to
which
she
had
made
no
response
but
a
headshake
of
a
sharpness
that
settled
it
why
sha
we
all
the
more
keep
meeting
i
mean
meeting
this
way
only
this
way
at
my
place
there
nothing
to
do
with
and
i
hope
of
course
you
turn
up
with
your
correspondence
when
it
suits
you
whether
i
stay
or
not
i
mean
for
i
shall
probably
not
stay
you
going
somewhere
else
he
put
it
with
positive
anxiety
yes
ever
so
far
away
to
the
other
end
of
london
there
are
all
sorts
of
reasons
i
ca
tell
you
and
it
practically
settled
it
better
for
me
much
and
i
only
kept
on
at
cocker
for
for
me
making
out
in
the
dusk
that
he
fairly
blushed
she
now
measured
how
far
he
had
been
from
knowing
too
much
too
much
she
called
it
at
present
and
that
was
easy
since
it
proved
so
abundantly
enough
for
her
that
he
should
simply
be
where
he
was
as
we
shall
never
talk
this
way
but
night
never
never
again
here
it
all
is
i
say
it
i
do
care
what
you
think
it
does
matter
i
only
want
to
help
you
besides
you
kind
you
kind
i
been
thinking
then
of
leaving
for
ever
so
long
but
you
come
so
often
at
times
and
you
had
so
much
to
do
and
it
has
been
so
pleasant
and
interesting
that
i
remained
kept
putting
off
any
change
more
than
once
when
i
had
nearly
decided
you
turned
up
again
and
i
thought
no
that
the
simple
fact
she
had
by
this
time
got
her
confusion
down
so
completely
that
she
could
laugh
this
is
what
i
meant
when
i
said
to
you
just
now
that
i
i
known
perfectly
that
you
knew
i
took
trouble
for
you
and
that
knowledge
has
been
for
me
and
i
seemed
to
see
it
was
for
you
as
if
there
were
something
i
do
know
what
to
call
it
between
us
i
mean
something
unusual
and
good
and
awfully
nice
something
not
a
bit
horrid
or
vulgar
she
had
by
this
time
she
could
see
produced
a
great
effect
on
him
but
she
would
have
spoken
the
truth
to
herself
had
she
at
the
same
moment
declared
that
she
did
in
the
least
care
all
the
more
that
the
effect
must
be
one
of
extreme
perplexity
what
in
it
all
was
visibly
clear
for
him
none
the
less
was
that
he
was
tremendously
glad
he
had
met
her
she
held
him
and
he
was
astonished
at
the
force
of
it
he
was
intent
immensely
considerate
his
elbow
was
on
the
back
of
the
seat
and
his
head
with
the
pushed
quite
back
in
a
boyish
way
so
that
she
really
saw
almost
for
the
first
time
his
forehead
and
hair
rested
on
the
hand
into
which
he
had
crumpled
his
gloves
yes
he
assented
not
a
bit
horrid
or
vulgar
she
just
hung
fire
a
moment
then
she
brought
out
the
whole
truth
do
anything
for
you
i
do
anything
for
you
never
in
her
life
had
she
known
anything
so
high
and
fine
as
this
just
letting
him
have
it
and
bravely
and
magnificently
leaving
it
did
the
place
the
associations
and
circumstances
perfectly
make
it
sound
what
it
was
and
that
exactly
the
beauty
so
she
bravely
and
magnificently
left
it
and
little
by
little
she
felt
him
take
it
up
take
it
down
as
if
they
had
been
on
a
satin
sofa
in
a
boudoir
she
had
never
seen
a
boudoir
but
there
had
been
lots
of
boudoirs
in
the
telegrams
what
she
had
said
at
all
events
sank
into
him
so
that
after
a
minute
he
simply
made
a
movement
that
had
the
result
of
placing
his
hand
on
her
own
presently
indeed
that
of
her
feeling
herself
firmly
enough
grasped
there
was
no
pressure
she
need
return
there
was
none
she
need
decline
she
just
sat
admirably
still
satisfied
for
the
time
with
the
surprise
and
bewilderment
of
the
impression
she
made
on
him
his
agitation
was
even
greater
on
the
whole
than
she
had
at
first
allowed
for
i
say
you
know
you
must
think
of
leaving
he
at
last
broke
out
of
leaving
cocker
you
mean
yes
you
must
stay
on
there
whatever
happens
and
help
a
fellow
she
was
silent
a
little
partly
because
it
was
so
strange
and
exquisite
to
feel
him
watch
her
as
if
it
really
mattered
to
him
and
he
were
almost
in
suspense
then
you
quite
recognised
what
i
tried
to
do
she
asked
why
was
that
exactly
what
i
dashed
over
from
my
door
just
now
to
thank
you
for
yes
so
you
said
and
do
you
believe
it
she
looked
down
a
moment
at
his
hand
which
continued
to
cover
her
own
whereupon
he
presently
drew
it
back
rather
restlessly
folding
his
arms
without
answering
his
question
she
went
on
have
you
ever
spoken
of
me
spoken
of
you
of
my
being
there
of
my
knowing
and
that
sort
of
thing
oh
never
to
a
human
creature
he
eagerly
declared
she
had
a
small
drop
at
this
which
was
expressed
in
another
pause
and
she
then
returned
to
what
he
had
just
asked
her
oh
yes
i
quite
believe
you
like
it
my
always
being
there
and
our
taking
things
up
so
familiarly
and
successfully
if
not
exactly
where
we
left
them
she
laughed
almost
always
at
least
at
an
interesting
point
he
was
about
to
say
something
in
reply
to
this
but
her
friendly
gaiety
was
quicker
you
want
a
great
many
things
in
life
a
great
many
comforts
and
helps
and
luxuries
you
want
everything
as
pleasant
as
possible
therefore
so
far
as
it
in
the
power
of
any
particular
person
to
contribute
to
all
that
she
had
turned
her
face
to
him
smiling
just
thinking
oh
see
here
but
he
was
highly
amused
well
what
then
he
enquired
as
if
to
humour
her
why
the
particular
person
must
never
fail
we
must
manage
it
for
you
somehow
he
threw
back
his
head
laughing
out
he
was
really
exhilarated
oh
yes
somehow
well
i
think
we
each
do
do
we
in
one
little
way
and
another
and
according
to
our
limited
lights
i
pleased
at
any
rate
for
myself
that
you
are
for
i
assure
you
i
done
my
best
you
do
better
than
any
one
he
had
struck
a
match
for
another
cigarette
and
the
flame
lighted
an
instant
his
responsive
finished
face
magnifying
into
a
pleasant
grimace
the
kindness
with
which
he
paid
her
this
tribute
you
awfully
clever
you
know
cleverer
cleverer
cleverer
he
had
appeared
on
the
point
of
making
some
tremendous
statement
then
suddenly
puffing
his
cigarette
and
shifting
almost
with
violence
on
his
seat
he
let
it
altogether
fall
chapter
xvii
in
spite
of
this
drop
if
not
just
by
reason
of
it
she
felt
as
if
lady
bradeen
all
but
named
out
had
popped
straight
up
and
she
practically
betrayed
her
consciousness
by
waiting
a
little
before
she
rejoined
cleverer
than
who
well
if
i
was
afraid
you
think
i
swagger
i
should
say
than
anybody
if
you
leave
your
place
there
where
shall
you
go
he
more
gravely
asked
oh
too
far
for
you
ever
to
find
me
i
find
you
anywhere
the
tone
of
this
was
so
still
more
serious
that
she
had
but
her
one
acknowledgement
i
do
anything
for
you
i
do
anything
for
you
she
repeated
she
had
already
she
felt
said
it
all
so
what
did
anything
more
anything
less
matter
that
was
the
very
reason
indeed
why
she
could
with
a
lighter
note
ease
him
generously
of
any
awkwardness
produced
by
solemnity
either
his
own
or
hers
of
course
it
must
be
nice
for
you
to
be
able
to
think
there
are
people
all
about
who
feel
in
such
a
way
in
immediate
appreciation
of
this
however
he
only
smoked
without
looking
at
her
but
you
do
want
to
give
up
your
present
work
he
at
last
threw
out
i
mean
you
stay
in
the
oh
yes
i
think
i
a
genius
for
that
rather
no
one
can
touch
you
with
this
he
turned
more
to
her
again
but
you
can
get
with
a
move
greater
advantages
i
can
get
in
the
suburbs
cheaper
lodgings
i
live
with
my
mother
we
need
some
space
there
a
particular
place
that
has
other
inducements
he
just
hesitated
where
is
it
oh
quite
out
of
way
you
never
have
time
but
i
tell
you
i
go
anywhere
do
you
believe
it
yes
for
once
or
twice
but
you
soon
see
it
would
do
for
you
he
smoked
and
considered
seemed
to
stretch
himself
a
little
and
with
his
legs
out
surrender
himself
comfortably
well
well
well
i
believe
everything
you
say
i
take
it
from
you
anything
you
like
in
the
most
extraordinary
way
it
struck
her
certainly
and
almost
without
bitterness
that
the
way
in
which
she
was
already
as
if
she
had
been
an
old
friend
arranging
for
him
and
preparing
the
only
magnificence
she
could
muster
was
quite
the
most
extraordinary
do
go
he
presently
went
on
i
shall
miss
you
too
horribly
so
that
you
just
put
it
to
me
as
a
definite
request
oh
how
she
tried
to
divest
this
of
all
sound
of
the
hardness
of
bargaining
that
ought
to
have
been
easy
enough
for
what
was
she
arranging
to
get
before
he
could
answer
she
had
continued
to
be
perfectly
fair
i
should
tell
you
i
recognise
at
cocker
certain
strong
attractions
all
you
people
come
i
like
all
the
horrors
the
horrors
those
you
all
you
know
the
set
i
mean
set
show
me
with
as
good
a
conscience
as
if
i
had
no
more
feeling
than
a
he
looked
quite
excited
at
the
way
she
put
it
oh
they
do
know
do
know
i
not
stupid
no
how
should
they
yes
how
should
they
said
the
captain
sympathetically
but
rather
strong
what
you
is
rather
strong
the
girl
promptly
returned
what
do
your
extravagance
your
selfishness
your
immorality
your
crimes
she
pursued
without
heeding
his
expression
i
her
companion
showed
the
queerest
stare
i
like
them
as
i
tell
you
i
revel
in
them
but
we
need
go
into
that
she
quietly
went
on
for
all
i
get
out
of
it
is
the
harmless
pleasure
of
knowing
i
know
i
know
i
know
she
breathed
it
ever
so
gently
yes
that
what
has
been
between
us
he
answered
much
more
simply
she
could
enjoy
his
simplicity
in
silence
and
for
a
moment
she
did
so
if
i
do
stay
because
you
want
it
and
i
rather
capable
of
that
there
are
two
or
three
things
i
think
you
ought
to
remember
one
is
you
know
that
i
there
sometimes
for
days
and
weeks
together
without
your
ever
coming
oh
i
come
every
day
he
honestly
cried
she
was
on
the
point
at
this
of
imitating
with
her
hand
his
movement
of
shortly
before
but
she
checked
herself
and
there
was
no
want
of
effect
in
her
soothing
substitute
how
can
you
how
can
you
he
had
too
manifestly
only
to
look
at
it
there
in
the
vulgarly
animated
gloom
to
see
that
he
could
and
at
this
point
by
the
mere
action
of
his
silence
everything
they
had
so
definitely
not
named
the
whole
presence
round
which
they
had
been
circling
became
part
of
their
reference
settled
in
solidly
between
them
it
was
as
if
then
for
a
minute
they
sat
and
saw
it
all
in
each
other
eyes
saw
so
much
that
there
was
no
need
of
a
pretext
for
sounding
it
at
last
your
danger
your
danger
her
voice
indeed
trembled
with
it
and
she
could
only
for
the
moment
again
leave
it
so
during
this
moment
he
leaned
back
on
the
bench
meeting
her
in
silence
and
with
a
face
that
grew
more
strange
it
grew
so
strange
that
after
a
further
instant
she
got
straight
up
she
stood
there
as
if
their
talk
were
now
over
and
he
just
sat
and
watched
her
it
was
as
if
now
owing
to
the
third
person
they
had
brought
in
they
must
be
more
careful
so
that
the
most
he
could
finally
say
was
that
where
it
is
that
where
it
is
the
girl
as
guardedly
replied
he
sat
still
and
she
added
i
wo
give
you
up
he
appealed
but
without
moving
i
do
quite
see
my
way
but
i
wo
give
you
up
she
repeated
there
it
brought
him
with
a
jerk
to
his
feet
tossing
away
his
cigarette
his
poor
face
was
flushed
see
here
see
here
no
i
wo
but
i
must
leave
you
now
she
went
on
as
if
not
hearing
him
see
here
see
here
he
tried
from
the
bench
to
take
her
hand
again
but
that
definitely
settled
it
for
her
this
would
after
all
be
as
bad
as
his
asking
her
to
supper
you
must
come
with
me
no
no
he
sank
back
quite
blank
as
if
she
had
pushed
him
i
may
see
you
home
no
no
let
me
go
he
looked
almost
as
if
she
had
struck
him
but
she
did
care
and
the
manner
in
which
she
spoke
it
was
literally
as
if
she
were
angry
had
the
force
of
a
command
stay
where
you
are
see
here
see
here
he
nevertheless
pleaded
i
wo
give
you
up
she
cried
once
more
this
time
quite
with
passion
on
which
she
got
away
from
him
as
fast
as
she
could
and
left
him
staring
after
her
chapter
xviii
mudge
had
lately
been
so
occupied
with
their
famous
plans
that
he
had
neglected
for
a
while
the
question
of
her
transfer
but
down
at
bournemouth
which
had
found
itself
selected
as
the
field
of
their
recreation
by
a
process
consisting
it
seemed
exclusively
of
innumerable
pages
of
the
neatest
arithmetic
in
a
very
greasy
but
most
orderly
little
the
distracting
possible
melted
away
the
fleeting
absolute
ruled
the
scene
the
plans
hour
by
hour
were
simply
superseded
and
it
was
much
of
a
rest
to
the
girl
as
she
sat
on
the
pier
and
overlooked
the
sea
and
the
company
to
see
them
evaporate
in
rosy
fumes
and
to
feel
that
from
moment
to
moment
there
was
less
left
to
cipher
about
the
week
proves
blissfully
fine
and
her
mother
at
their
lodgings
partly
to
her
embarrassment
and
partly
to
her
relief
struck
up
with
the
landlady
an
alliance
that
left
the
younger
couple
a
great
deal
of
freedom
this
relative
took
her
pleasure
of
a
week
at
bournemouth
in
a
stuffy
and
endless
talks
to
that
degree
even
that
mudge
himself
habitually
inclined
indeed
to
a
scrutiny
of
all
mysteries
and
to
seeing
as
he
sometimes
admitted
too
much
in
things
made
remarks
on
it
as
he
sat
on
the
cliff
with
his
betrothed
or
on
the
decks
of
steamers
that
conveyed
them
items
in
terrific
totals
of
enjoyment
to
the
isle
of
wight
and
the
dorset
coast
he
had
a
lodging
in
another
house
where
he
had
speedily
learned
the
importance
of
keeping
his
eyes
open
and
he
made
no
secret
of
his
suspecting
that
sinister
mutual
connivances
might
spring
under
the
roof
of
his
companions
from
unnatural
sociabilities
at
the
same
time
he
fully
recognised
that
as
a
source
of
anxiety
not
to
say
of
expense
his
future
law
would
have
weighted
them
more
by
accompanying
their
steps
than
by
giving
her
hostess
in
the
interest
of
the
tendency
they
considered
that
they
never
mentioned
equivalent
pledges
as
to
the
caddy
and
the
these
were
the
questions
these
indeed
the
familiar
commodities
that
he
had
now
to
put
into
the
scales
and
his
betrothed
had
in
consequence
during
her
holiday
the
odd
and
yet
pleasant
and
almost
languid
sense
of
an
anticlimax
she
had
become
conscious
of
an
extraordinary
collapse
a
surrender
to
stillness
and
to
retrospect
she
cared
neither
to
walk
nor
to
sail
it
was
enough
for
her
to
sit
on
benches
and
wonder
at
the
sea
and
taste
the
air
and
not
be
at
cocker
and
not
see
the
she
still
seemed
to
wait
for
something
something
in
the
key
of
the
immense
discussions
that
had
mapped
out
their
little
week
of
idleness
on
the
scale
of
a
something
came
at
last
but
without
perhaps
appearing
quite
adequately
to
crown
the
monument
preparation
and
precaution
were
however
the
natural
flowers
of
mudge
mind
and
in
proportion
as
these
things
declined
in
one
quarter
they
inevitably
bloomed
elsewhere
he
could
always
at
the
worst
have
on
tuesday
the
project
of
their
taking
the
swanage
boat
on
thursday
and
on
thursday
that
of
their
ordering
minced
kidneys
on
saturday
he
had
moreover
a
constant
gift
of
inexorable
enquiry
as
to
where
and
what
they
should
have
gone
and
have
done
if
they
had
been
exactly
as
they
were
he
had
in
short
his
resources
and
his
mistress
had
never
been
so
conscious
of
them
on
the
other
hand
they
never
interfered
so
little
with
her
own
she
liked
to
be
as
she
was
if
it
could
only
have
lasted
she
could
accept
even
without
bitterness
a
rigour
of
economy
so
great
that
the
little
fee
they
paid
for
admission
to
the
pier
had
to
be
balanced
against
other
delights
the
people
at
ladle
and
at
thrupp
had
ways
of
amusing
themselves
whereas
she
had
to
sit
and
hear
mudge
talk
of
what
he
might
do
if
he
did
take
a
bath
or
of
the
bath
he
might
take
if
he
only
had
taken
something
else
he
was
always
with
her
now
of
course
always
beside
her
she
saw
him
more
than
hourly
more
than
ever
yet
more
even
than
he
had
planned
she
should
do
at
chalk
farm
she
preferred
to
sit
at
the
far
end
away
from
the
band
and
the
crowd
as
to
which
she
had
frequent
differences
with
her
friend
who
reminded
her
often
that
they
could
have
only
in
the
thick
of
it
the
sense
of
the
money
they
were
getting
back
that
had
little
effect
on
her
for
she
got
back
her
money
by
seeing
many
things
the
things
of
the
past
year
fall
together
and
connect
themselves
undergo
the
happy
relegation
that
transforms
melancholy
and
misery
passion
and
effort
into
experience
and
knowledge
she
liked
having
done
with
them
as
she
assured
herself
she
had
practically
done
and
the
strange
thing
was
that
she
neither
missed
the
procession
now
nor
wished
to
keep
her
place
for
it
it
had
become
there
in
the
sun
and
the
breeze
and
the
a
story
a
picture
of
another
life
if
mudge
himself
liked
processions
liked
them
at
bournemouth
and
on
the
pier
quite
as
much
as
at
chalk
farm
or
anywhere
she
learned
after
a
little
not
to
be
worried
by
his
perpetual
counting
of
the
figures
that
made
them
up
there
were
dreadful
women
in
particular
usually
fat
and
in
men
caps
and
write
shoes
whom
he
could
never
let
alone
not
that
she
cared
it
was
not
the
great
world
the
world
of
cocker
and
ladle
and
thrupp
but
it
offered
an
endless
field
to
his
faculties
of
memory
philosophy
and
frolic
she
had
never
accepted
him
so
much
never
arranged
so
successfully
for
making
him
chatter
while
she
carried
on
secret
conversations
this
separate
commerce
was
with
herself
and
if
they
both
practised
a
great
thrift
she
had
quite
mastered
that
of
merely
spending
words
enough
to
keep
him
imperturbably
and
continuously
going
he
was
charmed
with
the
panorama
not
knowing
or
at
any
rate
not
at
all
showing
that
he
knew
what
far
other
images
peopled
her
mind
than
the
women
in
the
navy
caps
and
the
in
the
blazers
his
observations
on
these
types
his
general
interpretation
of
the
show
brought
home
to
her
the
prospect
of
chalk
farm
she
wondered
sometimes
that
he
should
have
derived
so
little
illumination
during
his
period
from
the
society
at
cocker
but
one
evening
while
their
holiday
cloudlessly
waned
he
gave
her
such
a
proof
of
his
quality
as
might
have
made
her
ashamed
of
her
many
suppressions
he
brought
out
something
that
in
all
his
overflow
he
had
been
able
to
keep
back
till
other
matters
were
disposed
of
it
was
the
announcement
that
he
was
at
last
ready
to
marry
that
he
saw
his
way
a
rise
at
chalk
farm
had
been
offered
him
he
was
to
be
taken
into
the
business
bringing
with
him
a
capital
the
estimation
of
which
by
other
parties
constituted
the
handsomest
recognition
yet
made
of
the
head
on
his
shoulders
therefore
their
waiting
was
over
it
could
be
a
question
of
a
near
date
they
would
settle
this
date
before
going
back
and
he
meanwhile
had
his
eye
on
a
sweet
little
home
he
would
take
her
to
see
it
on
their
first
sunday
chapter
xix
his
having
kept
this
great
news
for
the
last
having
had
such
a
card
up
his
sleeve
and
not
floated
it
out
in
the
current
of
his
chatter
and
the
luxury
of
their
leisure
was
one
of
those
incalculable
strokes
by
which
he
could
still
affect
her
the
kind
of
thing
that
reminded
her
of
the
latent
force
that
had
ejected
the
drunken
soldier
an
example
of
the
profundity
of
which
his
promotion
was
the
proof
she
listened
a
while
in
silence
on
this
occasion
to
the
wafted
strains
of
the
music
she
took
it
in
as
she
had
not
quite
done
before
that
her
future
was
now
constituted
mudge
was
distinctly
her
fate
yet
at
this
moment
she
turned
her
face
quite
away
from
him
showing
him
so
long
a
mere
quarter
of
her
cheek
that
she
at
last
again
heard
his
voice
he
could
see
a
pair
of
tears
that
were
partly
the
reason
of
her
delay
to
give
him
the
assurance
he
required
but
he
expressed
at
a
venture
the
hope
that
she
had
had
her
fill
of
cocker
she
was
finally
able
to
turn
back
oh
quite
there
nothing
going
on
no
one
comes
but
the
americans
at
thrupp
and
they
do
do
much
they
do
seem
to
have
a
secret
in
the
world
then
the
extraordinary
reason
you
been
giving
me
for
holding
on
there
has
ceased
to
work
she
thought
a
moment
yes
that
one
i
seen
the
thing
through
got
them
all
in
my
pocket
so
you
ready
to
come
for
a
little
again
she
made
no
answer
no
not
yet
all
the
same
still
got
a
reason
a
different
one
he
looked
her
all
over
as
if
it
might
have
been
something
she
kept
in
her
mouth
or
her
glove
or
under
her
jacket
something
she
was
even
sitting
upon
well
i
have
it
please
i
went
out
the
other
night
and
sat
in
the
park
with
a
gentleman
she
said
at
last
nothing
was
ever
seen
like
his
confidence
in
her
and
she
wondered
a
little
now
why
it
did
irritate
her
it
only
gave
her
ease
and
space
as
she
felt
for
telling
him
the
whole
truth
that
no
one
knew
it
had
arrived
at
present
at
her
really
wanting
to
do
that
and
yet
to
do
it
not
in
the
least
for
mudge
but
altogether
and
only
for
herself
this
truth
filled
out
for
her
there
the
whole
experience
about
to
relinquish
suffused
and
coloured
it
as
a
picture
that
she
should
keep
and
that
describe
it
as
she
might
no
one
but
herself
would
ever
really
see
moreover
she
had
no
desire
whatever
to
make
mudge
jealous
there
would
be
no
amusement
in
it
for
the
amusement
she
had
lately
known
had
spoiled
her
for
lower
pleasures
there
were
even
no
materials
for
it
the
odd
thing
was
how
she
never
doubted
that
properly
handled
his
passion
was
poisonable
what
had
happened
was
that
he
had
cannily
selected
a
partner
with
no
poison
to
distil
she
read
then
and
there
that
she
should
never
interest
herself
in
anybody
as
to
whom
some
other
sentiment
some
superior
view
would
be
sure
to
interfere
for
him
with
jealousy
and
what
did
you
get
out
of
that
he
asked
with
a
concern
that
was
not
in
the
least
for
his
honour
nothing
but
a
good
chance
to
promise
him
i
would
forsake
him
one
of
my
customers
then
it
for
him
not
to
forsake
well
he
wo
it
all
right
but
i
must
just
keep
on
as
long
as
he
may
want
me
want
you
to
sit
with
him
in
the
park
he
may
want
me
for
that
but
i
sha
i
rather
liked
it
but
once
under
the
circumstances
is
enough
i
can
do
better
for
him
in
another
manner
and
what
manner
pray
well
elsewhere
elsewhere
i
this
was
an
ejaculation
used
also
by
captain
everard
but
oh
with
what
a
different
sound
you
need
there
nothing
to
be
said
and
yet
you
ought
perhaps
to
know
certainly
i
ought
but
up
to
now
why
exactly
what
i
told
him
that
i
do
anything
for
him
what
do
you
mean
by
everything
mudge
immediate
comment
on
this
statement
was
to
draw
from
his
pocket
a
crumpled
paper
containing
the
remains
of
half
a
pound
of
sundries
these
sundries
had
figured
conspicuously
in
his
prospective
sketch
of
their
tour
but
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
three
days
that
they
had
defined
themselves
unmistakeably
as
have
another
one
he
said
she
had
another
but
not
the
one
he
indicated
and
then
he
continued
what
took
place
afterwards
afterwards
what
did
you
do
when
you
had
told
him
you
do
everything
i
simply
came
away
out
of
the
park
yes
leaving
him
there
i
did
let
him
follow
me
then
what
did
you
let
him
do
i
did
let
him
do
anything
mudge
considered
an
instant
then
what
did
you
go
there
for
his
tone
was
even
slightly
critical
i
did
quite
know
at
the
time
it
was
simply
to
be
with
him
i
suppose
just
once
he
in
danger
and
i
wanted
him
to
know
i
know
it
it
makes
meeting
him
at
cocker
since
it
that
i
want
to
stay
on
for
more
interesting
it
makes
it
mighty
interesting
for
mudge
freely
declared
yet
he
did
follow
you
he
asked
would
yes
of
course
that
was
the
way
you
began
you
know
you
awfully
inferior
to
him
well
my
dear
you
not
inferior
to
anybody
you
got
a
cheek
what
he
in
danger
of
of
being
found
out
he
in
love
with
a
lady
and
it
is
right
and
i
found
him
out
that
be
a
for
mudge
joked
you
mean
she
has
a
husband
never
mind
what
she
has
they
in
awful
danger
but
his
is
the
worst
because
he
in
danger
from
her
too
like
me
from
you
the
woman
love
if
he
in
the
same
funk
as
me
he
in
a
worse
one
he
not
only
afraid
of
the
lady
he
afraid
of
other
things
mudge
selected
another
well
i
only
afraid
of
one
but
how
in
the
world
can
you
help
this
party
i
do
know
perhaps
not
at
all
but
so
long
as
there
a
chance
you
wo
come
away
no
you
got
to
wait
for
me
mudge
enjoyed
what
was
in
his
mouth
and
what
will
he
give
you
give
me
if
you
do
help
him
nothing
nothing
in
all
the
wide
world
then
what
will
he
give
mudge
enquired
i
mean
for
waiting
the
girl
thought
a
moment
then
she
got
up
to
walk
he
never
heard
of
you
she
replied
you
have
mentioned
me
we
never
mention
anything
what
i
told
you
is
just
what
i
found
out
mudge
who
had
remained
on
the
bench
looked
up
at
her
she
often
preferred
to
be
quiet
when
he
proposed
to
walk
but
now
that
he
seemed
to
wish
to
sit
she
had
a
desire
to
move
but
you
have
told
me
what
has
found
out
she
considered
her
lover
he
never
find
my
dear
her
lover
still
on
his
seat
appealed
to
her
in
something
of
the
attitude
in
which
she
had
last
left
captain
everard
but
the
impression
was
not
the
same
then
where
do
i
come
in
you
do
come
in
at
all
that
just
the
beauty
of
it
and
with
this
she
turned
to
mingle
with
the
multitude
collected
round
the
band
mudge
presently
overtook
her
and
drew
her
arm
into
his
own
with
a
quiet
force
that
expressed
the
serenity
of
possession
in
consonance
with
which
it
was
only
when
they
parted
for
the
night
at
her
door
that
he
referred
again
to
what
she
had
told
him
have
you
seen
him
since
since
the
night
in
the
park
no
not
once
oh
what
a
cad
said
mudge
chapter
xx
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
october
that
she
saw
captain
everard
again
and
on
that
occasion
the
only
one
of
all
the
series
on
which
hindrance
had
been
so
utter
no
communication
with
him
proved
possible
she
had
made
out
even
from
the
cage
that
it
was
a
charming
golden
day
a
patch
of
hazy
autumn
sunlight
lay
across
the
sanded
floor
and
also
higher
up
quickened
into
brightness
a
row
of
ruddy
bottled
syrups
work
was
slack
and
the
place
in
general
empty
the
town
as
they
said
in
the
cage
had
not
waked
up
and
the
feeling
of
the
day
likened
itself
to
something
than
in
happier
conditions
she
would
have
thought
of
romantically
as
saint
martin
summer
the
had
gone
to
his
dinner
she
herself
was
busy
with
arrears
of
postal
jobs
in
the
midst
of
which
she
became
aware
that
captain
everard
had
apparently
been
in
the
shop
a
minute
and
that
buckton
had
already
seized
him
he
had
as
usual
half
a
dozen
telegrams
and
when
he
saw
that
she
saw
him
and
their
eyes
met
he
gave
on
bowing
to
her
an
exaggerated
laugh
in
which
she
read
a
new
consciousness
it
was
a
confession
of
awkwardness
it
seemed
to
tell
her
that
of
course
he
knew
he
ought
better
to
have
kept
his
head
ought
to
have
been
clever
enough
to
wait
on
some
pretext
till
he
should
have
found
her
free
buckton
was
a
long
time
with
him
and
her
attention
was
soon
demanded
by
other
visitors
so
that
nothing
passed
between
them
but
the
fulness
of
their
silence
the
look
she
took
from
him
was
his
greeting
and
the
other
one
a
simple
sign
of
the
eyes
sent
her
before
going
out
the
only
token
they
exchanged
therefore
was
his
tacit
assent
to
her
wish
that
since
they
could
attempt
a
certain
frankness
they
should
attempt
nothing
at
all
this
was
her
intense
preference
she
could
be
as
still
and
cold
as
any
one
when
that
was
the
sole
solution
yet
more
than
any
contact
hitherto
achieved
these
counted
instants
struck
her
as
marking
a
step
they
were
built
so
just
in
the
mere
flash
on
the
recognition
of
his
now
definitely
knowing
what
it
was
she
would
do
for
him
the
anything
anything
she
had
uttered
in
the
park
went
to
and
fro
between
them
and
under
the
china
that
interposed
it
had
all
at
last
even
put
on
the
air
of
their
not
needing
now
clumsily
to
manoeuvre
to
converse
their
former
little
postal
the
intense
implications
of
questions
and
answers
and
change
had
become
in
the
light
of
the
personal
fact
of
their
having
had
their
moment
a
possibility
comparatively
poor
it
was
as
if
they
had
met
for
all
time
it
exerted
on
their
being
in
presence
again
an
influence
so
prodigious
when
she
watched
herself
in
the
memory
of
that
night
walk
away
from
him
as
if
she
were
making
an
end
she
found
something
too
pitiful
in
the
primness
of
such
a
gait
had
she
precisely
established
on
the
part
of
each
a
consciousness
that
could
end
only
with
death
it
must
be
admitted
that
in
spite
of
this
brave
margin
an
irritation
after
he
had
gone
remained
with
her
a
sense
that
presently
became
one
with
a
still
sharper
hatred
of
buckton
who
on
her
withdrawal
had
retired
with
the
telegrams
to
the
sounder
and
left
her
the
other
work
she
knew
indeed
she
should
have
a
chance
to
see
them
when
she
would
on
file
and
she
was
divided
as
the
day
went
on
between
the
two
impressions
of
all
that
was
lost
and
all
that
was
what
beset
her
above
all
and
as
she
had
almost
never
known
it
before
was
the
desire
to
bound
straight
out
to
overtake
the
autumn
afternoon
before
it
passed
away
for
ever
and
hurry
off
to
the
park
and
perhaps
be
with
him
there
again
on
a
bench
it
became
for
an
hour
a
fantastic
vision
with
her
that
he
might
just
have
gone
to
sit
and
wait
for
her
she
could
almost
hear
him
through
the
tick
of
the
sounder
scatter
with
his
stick
in
his
impatience
the
fallen
leaves
of
october
why
should
such
a
vision
seize
her
at
this
particular
moment
with
such
a
shake
there
was
a
time
from
four
to
five
when
she
could
have
cried
with
happiness
and
rage
business
quickened
it
seemed
toward
five
as
if
the
town
did
wake
up
she
had
therefore
more
to
do
and
she
went
through
it
with
little
sharp
stampings
and
jerkings
she
made
the
crisp
fairly
snap
while
she
breathed
to
herself
it
the
last
day
the
last
day
the
last
day
of
what
she
could
have
told
all
she
knew
now
was
that
if
she
out
of
the
cage
she
would
in
the
least
have
minded
this
time
its
not
yet
being
dark
she
would
have
gone
straight
toward
park
chambers
and
have
hung
about
there
till
no
matter
when
she
would
have
waited
stayed
rung
asked
have
gone
in
sat
on
the
stairs
what
the
day
was
the
last
of
was
probably
to
her
strained
inner
sense
the
group
of
golden
ones
of
any
occasion
for
seeing
the
hazy
sunshine
slant
at
that
angle
into
the
smelly
shop
of
any
range
of
chances
for
his
wishing
still
to
repeat
to
her
the
two
words
she
had
in
the
park
scarcely
let
him
bring
out
see
here
see
here
the
sound
of
these
two
words
had
been
with
her
perpetually
but
it
was
in
her
ears
without
mercy
with
a
loudness
that
grew
and
grew
what
was
it
they
then
expressed
what
was
it
he
had
wanted
her
to
see
she
seemed
whatever
it
was
perfectly
to
see
it
now
to
see
that
if
she
should
just
chuck
the
whole
thing
should
have
a
great
and
beautiful
courage
he
would
somehow
make
everything
up
to
her
when
the
clock
struck
five
she
was
on
the
very
point
of
saying
to
buckton
that
she
was
deadly
ill
and
rapidly
getting
worse
this
announcement
was
on
her
lips
and
she
had
quite
composed
the
pale
hard
face
she
would
offer
him
i
ca
stop
i
must
go
home
if
i
feel
better
later
on
i
come
back
i
very
sorry
but
i
go
at
that
instant
captain
everard
once
more
stood
there
producing
in
her
agitated
spirit
by
his
real
presence
the
strangest
quickest
revolution
he
stopped
her
off
without
knowing
it
and
by
the
time
he
had
been
a
minute
in
the
shop
she
felt
herself
saved
that
was
from
the
first
minute
how
she
thought
of
it
there
were
again
other
persons
with
whom
she
was
occupied
and
again
the
situation
could
only
be
expressed
by
their
silence
it
was
expressed
of
a
truth
in
a
larger
phrase
than
ever
yet
for
her
eyes
now
spoke
to
him
with
a
kind
of
supplication
be
quiet
be
quiet
they
pleaded
and
they
saw
his
own
reply
i
do
whatever
you
say
i
wo
even
look
at
you
see
see
they
kept
conveying
thus
with
the
friendliest
liberality
that
they
would
look
quite
positively
would
what
she
was
to
see
was
that
he
hovered
at
the
other
end
of
the
counter
buckton
end
and
surrendered
himself
again
to
that
frustration
it
quickly
proved
so
great
indeed
that
what
she
was
to
see
further
was
how
he
turned
away
before
he
was
attended
to
and
hung
off
waiting
smoking
looking
about
the
shop
how
he
went
over
to
cocker
own
counter
and
appeared
to
price
things
gave
in
fact
presently
two
or
three
orders
and
put
down
money
stood
there
a
long
time
with
his
back
to
her
considerately
abstaining
from
any
glance
round
to
see
if
she
were
free
it
at
last
came
to
pass
in
this
way
that
he
had
remained
in
the
shop
longer
than
she
had
ever
yet
known
to
do
and
that
nevertheless
when
he
did
turn
about
she
could
see
him
time
himself
she
was
freshly
taken
up
and
cross
straight
to
her
postal
subordinate
whom
some
one
else
had
released
he
had
in
his
hand
all
this
while
neither
letters
nor
telegrams
and
now
that
he
was
close
to
her
for
she
was
close
to
the
it
brought
her
heart
into
her
mouth
merely
to
see
him
look
at
her
neighbour
and
open
his
lips
she
was
too
nervous
to
bear
it
he
asked
for
a
office
guide
and
the
young
man
whipped
out
a
new
one
whereupon
he
said
he
wished
not
to
purchase
but
only
to
consult
one
a
moment
with
which
the
copy
kept
on
loan
being
produced
he
once
more
wandered
off
what
was
he
doing
to
her
what
did
he
want
of
her
well
it
was
just
the
aggravation
of
his
see
here
she
felt
at
this
moment
strangely
and
portentously
afraid
of
him
had
in
her
ears
the
hum
of
a
sense
that
should
it
come
to
that
kind
of
tension
she
must
fly
on
the
spot
to
chalk
farm
mixed
with
her
dread
and
with
her
reflexion
was
the
idea
that
if
he
wanted
her
so
much
as
he
seemed
to
show
it
might
be
after
all
simply
to
do
for
him
the
anything
she
had
promised
the
everything
she
had
thought
it
so
fine
to
bring
out
to
mudge
he
might
want
her
to
help
him
might
have
some
particular
appeal
though
indeed
his
manner
denote
that
denoted
on
the
contrary
an
embarrassment
an
indecision
something
of
a
desire
not
so
much
to
be
helped
as
to
be
treated
rather
more
nicely
than
she
had
treated
him
the
other
time
yes
he
considered
quite
probably
that
he
had
help
rather
to
offer
than
to
ask
for
still
none
the
less
when
he
again
saw
her
free
he
continued
to
keep
away
from
her
when
he
came
back
with
his
thumbed
guide
it
was
buckton
he
caught
it
was
from
buckton
he
obtained
of
stamps
after
asking
for
the
stamps
he
asked
quite
as
a
second
thought
for
a
for
ten
shillings
what
did
he
want
with
so
many
stamps
when
he
wrote
so
few
letters
how
could
he
enclose
a
in
a
telegram
she
expected
him
the
next
thing
to
go
into
the
corner
and
make
up
one
of
his
telegrams
half
a
dozen
of
them
on
purpose
to
prolong
his
presence
she
had
so
completely
stopped
looking
at
him
that
she
could
only
guess
his
movements
guess
even
where
his
eyes
rested
finally
she
saw
him
make
a
dash
that
might
have
been
toward
the
nook
where
the
forms
were
hung
and
at
this
she
suddenly
felt
that
she
could
keep
it
up
the
had
just
taken
a
telegram
from
a
slavey
and
to
give
herself
something
to
cover
her
she
snatched
it
out
of
his
hand
the
gesture
was
so
violent
that
he
gave
her
in
return
an
odd
look
and
she
also
perceived
that
buckton
noticed
it
the
latter
personage
with
a
quick
stare
at
her
appeared
for
an
instant
to
wonder
whether
his
snatching
it
in
turn
might
be
the
thing
she
would
least
like
and
she
anticipated
this
practical
criticism
by
the
frankest
glare
she
had
ever
given
him
it
sufficed
this
time
it
paralysed
him
and
she
sought
with
her
trophy
the
refuge
of
the
sounder
chapter
xxi
it
was
repeated
the
next
day
it
went
on
for
three
days
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
knew
what
to
think
when
at
the
beginning
she
had
emerged
from
her
temporary
shelter
captain
everard
had
quitted
the
shop
and
he
had
not
come
again
that
evening
as
it
had
struck
her
he
possibly
might
might
all
the
more
easily
that
there
were
numberless
persons
who
came
morning
and
afternoon
numberless
times
so
that
he
necessarily
have
attracted
attention
the
second
day
it
was
different
and
yet
on
the
whole
worse
his
access
to
her
had
become
possible
she
felt
herself
even
reaping
the
fruit
of
her
yesterday
glare
at
buckton
but
transacting
his
business
with
him
did
simplify
it
could
in
spite
of
the
rigour
of
circumstance
feed
so
her
new
conviction
the
rigour
was
tremendous
and
his
telegrams
not
now
mere
pretexts
for
getting
at
her
were
apparently
genuine
yet
the
conviction
had
taken
but
a
night
to
develop
it
could
be
simply
enough
expressed
she
had
had
the
glimmer
of
it
the
day
before
in
her
idea
that
he
needed
no
more
help
than
she
had
already
given
that
it
was
help
he
himself
was
prepared
to
render
he
had
come
up
to
town
but
for
three
or
four
days
he
had
been
absolutely
obliged
to
be
absent
after
the
other
time
yet
he
would
now
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
her
stay
on
as
much
longer
as
she
liked
little
by
little
it
was
thus
clarified
though
from
the
first
flash
of
his
she
had
read
into
it
the
real
essence
that
was
what
the
night
before
at
eight
her
hour
to
go
had
made
her
hang
back
and
dawdle
she
did
last
things
or
pretended
to
do
them
to
be
in
the
cage
had
suddenly
become
her
safety
and
she
was
literally
afraid
of
the
alternate
self
who
might
be
waiting
outside
might
be
waiting
it
was
he
who
was
her
alternate
self
and
of
him
she
was
afraid
the
most
extraordinary
change
had
taken
place
in
her
from
the
moment
of
her
catching
the
impression
he
seemed
to
have
returned
on
purpose
to
give
her
just
before
she
had
done
so
on
that
bewitched
afternoon
she
had
seen
herself
approach
without
a
scruple
the
porter
at
park
chambers
then
as
the
effect
of
the
rush
of
a
consciousness
quite
altered
she
had
on
at
last
quitting
cocker
gone
straight
home
for
the
first
time
since
her
return
from
bournemouth
she
had
passed
his
door
every
night
for
weeks
but
nothing
would
have
induced
her
to
pass
it
now
this
change
was
the
tribute
of
her
fear
the
result
of
a
change
in
himself
as
to
which
she
needed
no
more
explanation
than
his
mere
face
vividly
gave
her
strange
though
it
was
to
find
an
element
of
deterrence
in
the
object
that
she
regarded
as
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
he
had
taken
it
from
her
in
the
park
that
night
that
she
wanted
him
not
to
propose
to
her
to
sup
but
he
had
put
away
the
lesson
by
this
time
he
practically
proposed
supper
every
time
he
looked
at
her
this
was
what
for
that
matter
mainly
filled
the
three
days
he
came
in
twice
on
each
of
these
and
it
was
as
if
he
came
in
to
give
her
a
chance
to
relent
that
was
after
all
she
said
to
herself
in
the
intervals
the
most
that
he
did
there
were
ways
she
fully
recognised
in
which
he
spared
her
and
other
particular
ways
as
to
which
she
meant
that
her
silence
should
be
full
to
him
of
exquisite
pleading
the
most
particular
of
all
was
his
not
being
outside
at
the
corner
when
she
quitted
the
place
for
the
night
this
he
might
so
easily
have
been
so
easily
if
he
had
been
so
nice
she
continued
to
recognise
in
his
forbearance
the
fruit
of
her
dumb
supplication
and
the
only
compensation
he
found
for
it
was
the
harmless
freedom
of
being
able
to
appear
to
say
yes
i
in
town
only
for
three
or
four
days
but
you
know
i
stay
on
he
struck
her
as
calling
attention
each
day
each
hour
to
the
rapid
ebb
of
time
he
exaggerated
to
the
point
of
putting
it
that
there
were
only
two
days
more
that
there
was
at
last
dreadfully
only
one
there
were
other
things
still
that
he
struck
her
as
doing
with
a
special
intention
as
to
the
most
marked
of
which
unless
indeed
it
were
the
most
obscure
she
might
well
have
marvelled
that
it
did
seem
to
her
more
horrid
it
was
either
the
frenzy
of
her
imagination
or
the
disorder
of
his
baffled
passion
that
gave
her
once
or
twice
the
vision
of
his
putting
down
redundant
money
sovereigns
not
concerned
with
the
little
payments
he
was
perpetually
making
so
that
she
might
give
him
some
sign
of
helping
him
to
slip
them
over
to
her
what
was
most
extraordinary
in
this
impression
was
the
amount
of
excuse
that
with
some
incoherence
she
found
for
him
he
wanted
to
pay
her
because
there
was
nothing
to
pay
her
for
he
wanted
to
offer
her
things
he
knew
she
would
take
he
wanted
to
show
her
how
much
he
respected
her
by
giving
her
the
supreme
chance
to
show
she
was
respectable
over
the
dryest
transactions
at
any
rate
their
eyes
had
out
these
questions
on
the
third
day
he
put
in
a
telegram
that
had
evidently
something
of
the
same
point
as
the
stray
sovereigns
a
message
that
was
in
the
first
place
concocted
and
that
on
a
second
thought
he
took
back
from
her
before
she
had
stamped
it
he
had
given
her
time
to
read
it
and
had
only
then
bethought
himself
that
he
had
better
not
send
it
if
it
was
not
to
lady
bradeen
at
twindle
where
she
knew
her
ladyship
then
to
be
this
was
because
an
address
to
doctor
buzzard
at
brickwood
was
just
as
good
with
the
added
merit
of
its
not
giving
away
quite
so
much
a
person
whom
he
had
still
after
all
in
a
manner
to
consider
it
was
of
course
most
complicated
only
half
lighted
but
there
was
discernibly
enough
a
scheme
of
communication
in
which
lady
bradeen
at
twindle
and
buzzard
at
brickwood
were
within
limits
one
and
the
same
person
the
words
he
had
shown
her
and
then
taken
back
consisted
at
all
events
of
the
brief
but
vivid
phrase
absolutely
impossible
the
point
was
not
that
she
should
transmit
it
the
point
was
just
that
she
should
see
it
what
was
absolutely
impossible
was
that
before
he
had
setted
something
at
cocker
he
should
go
either
to
twindle
or
to
brickwood
the
logic
of
this
in
turn
for
herself
was
that
she
could
lend
herself
to
no
settlement
so
long
as
she
so
intensely
knew
what
she
knew
was
that
he
was
almost
under
peril
of
life
clenched
in
a
situation
therefore
how
could
she
also
know
where
a
poor
girl
in
the
might
really
stand
it
was
more
and
more
between
them
that
if
he
might
convey
to
her
he
was
free
with
all
the
impossible
locked
away
into
a
closed
chapter
her
own
case
might
become
different
for
her
she
might
understand
and
meet
him
and
listen
but
he
could
convey
nothing
of
the
sort
and
he
only
fidgeted
and
floundered
in
his
want
of
power
the
chapter
was
in
the
least
closed
not
for
the
other
party
and
the
other
party
had
a
pull
somehow
and
somewhere
this
his
whole
attitude
and
expression
confessed
at
the
same
time
that
they
entreated
her
not
to
remember
and
not
to
mind
so
long
as
she
did
remember
and
did
mind
he
could
only
circle
about
and
go
and
come
doing
futile
things
of
which
he
was
ashamed
he
was
ashamed
of
his
two
words
to
buzzard
he
went
out
of
the
shop
as
soon
as
he
had
crumpled
up
the
paper
again
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
it
had
been
an
abject
little
exposure
of
dreadful
impossible
passion
he
appeared
in
fact
to
be
too
ashamed
to
come
back
he
had
once
more
left
town
and
a
first
week
elapsed
and
a
second
he
had
had
naturally
to
return
to
the
real
mistress
of
his
fate
she
had
insisted
she
knew
how
to
insist
and
he
could
put
in
another
hour
there
was
always
a
day
when
she
called
time
it
was
known
to
our
young
friend
moreover
that
he
had
now
been
dispatching
telegrams
from
other
offices
she
knew
at
last
so
much
that
she
had
quite
lost
her
earlier
sense
of
merely
guessing
there
were
no
different
shades
of
distinctness
it
all
bounced
out
chapter
xxii
eighteen
days
elapsed
and
she
had
begun
to
think
it
probable
she
should
never
see
him
again
he
too
then
understood
now
he
had
made
out
that
she
had
secrets
and
reasons
and
impediments
that
even
a
poor
girl
at
the
might
have
her
complications
with
the
charm
she
had
cast
on
him
lightened
by
distance
he
had
suffered
a
final
delicacy
to
speak
to
him
had
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
only
decent
to
let
her
alone
never
so
much
as
during
these
latter
days
had
she
felt
the
precariousness
of
their
relation
the
happy
beautiful
untroubled
original
one
if
it
could
only
have
been
restored
in
which
the
public
servant
and
the
casual
public
only
were
concerned
it
hung
at
the
best
by
the
merest
silken
thread
which
was
at
the
mercy
of
any
accident
and
might
snap
at
any
minute
she
arrived
by
the
end
of
the
fortnight
at
the
highest
sense
of
actual
fitness
never
doubting
that
her
decision
was
now
complete
she
would
just
give
him
a
few
days
more
to
come
back
to
her
on
a
proper
impersonal
basis
for
even
to
an
embarrassing
representative
of
the
casual
public
a
public
servant
with
a
conscience
did
owe
something
and
then
would
signify
to
mudge
that
she
was
ready
for
the
little
home
it
had
been
visited
in
the
further
talk
she
had
had
with
him
at
bournemouth
from
garret
to
cellar
and
they
had
especially
lingered
with
their
respectively
darkened
brows
before
the
niche
into
which
it
was
to
be
broached
to
her
mother
that
she
must
find
means
to
fit
he
had
put
it
to
her
more
definitely
than
before
that
his
calculations
had
allowed
for
that
dingy
presence
and
he
had
thereby
marked
the
greatest
impression
he
had
ever
made
on
her
it
was
a
stroke
superior
even
again
to
his
handling
of
the
drunken
soldier
what
she
considered
that
in
the
face
of
it
she
hung
on
at
cocker
for
was
something
she
could
only
have
described
as
the
common
fairness
of
a
last
word
her
actual
last
word
had
been
till
it
should
be
superseded
that
she
would
forsake
her
other
friend
and
it
stuck
to
her
through
thick
and
thin
that
she
was
still
at
her
post
and
on
her
honour
this
other
friend
had
shown
so
much
beauty
of
conduct
already
that
he
would
surely
after
all
just
long
enough
to
relieve
her
to
give
her
something
she
could
take
away
she
saw
it
caught
it
at
times
his
parting
present
and
there
were
moments
when
she
felt
herself
sitting
like
a
beggar
with
a
hand
held
out
to
almsgiver
who
only
fumbled
she
had
taken
the
sovereigns
but
she
take
the
penny
she
heard
in
imagination
on
the
counter
the
ring
of
the
copper
do
put
yourself
out
any
longer
he
would
say
for
so
bad
a
case
you
done
all
there
is
to
be
done
i
thank
and
acquit
and
release
you
our
lives
take
us
i
do
know
much
though
i
really
been
interested
about
yours
but
i
suppose
you
got
one
mine
at
any
rate
will
take
and
where
it
will
and
then
once
more
for
the
sweetest
faintest
flower
of
all
only
i
say
see
here
she
had
framed
the
whole
picture
with
a
squareness
that
included
also
the
image
of
how
again
she
would
decline
to
see
there
decline
as
she
might
say
to
see
anywhere
see
anything
yet
it
befell
that
just
in
the
fury
of
this
escape
she
saw
more
than
ever
he
came
back
one
night
with
a
rush
near
the
moment
of
their
closing
and
showed
her
a
face
so
different
and
new
so
upset
and
anxious
that
almost
anything
seemed
to
look
out
of
it
but
clear
recognition
he
poked
in
a
telegram
very
much
as
if
the
simple
sense
of
pressure
the
distress
of
extreme
haste
had
blurred
the
remembrance
of
where
in
particular
he
was
but
as
she
met
his
eyes
a
light
came
it
broke
indeed
on
the
spot
into
a
positive
conscious
glare
that
made
up
for
everything
since
it
was
an
instant
proclamation
of
the
celebrated
danger
it
seemed
to
pour
things
out
in
a
flood
oh
yes
here
it
is
it
upon
me
at
last
forget
for
god
sake
my
having
worried
or
bored
you
and
just
help
me
just
me
by
getting
this
off
without
the
loss
of
a
second
something
grave
had
clearly
occurred
a
crisis
declared
itself
she
recognised
immediately
the
person
to
whom
the
telegram
was
addressed
the
miss
dolman
of
parade
lodge
to
whom
lady
bradeen
had
wired
at
dover
on
the
last
occasion
and
whom
she
had
then
with
her
recollection
of
previous
arrangements
fitted
into
a
particular
setting
miss
dolman
had
figured
before
and
not
figured
since
but
she
was
now
the
subject
of
an
imperative
appeal
absolutely
necessary
to
see
you
take
last
train
victoria
if
you
can
catch
it
if
not
earliest
morning
and
answer
me
direct
either
way
reply
paid
said
the
girl
buckton
had
just
departed
and
the
was
at
the
sounder
there
was
no
other
representative
of
the
public
and
she
had
never
yet
as
it
seemed
to
her
not
even
in
the
street
or
in
the
park
been
so
alone
with
him
oh
yes
reply
paid
and
as
sharp
as
possible
please
she
affixed
the
stamps
in
a
flash
she
catch
the
train
she
then
declared
to
him
breathlessly
as
if
she
could
absolutely
guarantee
it
i
do
know
i
hope
so
it
awfully
important
so
kind
of
you
awfully
sharp
please
it
was
wonderfully
innocent
now
his
oblivion
of
all
but
his
danger
anything
else
that
had
ever
passed
between
them
was
utterly
out
of
it
well
she
had
wanted
him
to
be
impersonal
there
was
less
of
the
same
need
therefore
happily
for
herself
yet
she
only
took
time
before
she
flew
to
the
sounder
to
gasp
at
him
in
trouble
horrid
horrid
there
a
row
but
they
parted
on
it
in
the
next
breath
and
as
she
dashed
at
the
sounder
almost
pushing
in
her
violence
the
off
the
stool
she
caught
the
bang
with
which
at
cocker
door
in
his
further
precipitation
he
closed
the
apron
of
the
cab
into
which
he
had
leaped
as
he
rebounded
to
some
other
precaution
suggested
by
his
alarm
his
appeal
to
miss
dolman
flashed
straight
away
but
she
had
not
on
the
morrow
been
in
the
place
five
minutes
before
he
was
with
her
again
still
more
discomposed
and
quite
now
as
she
said
to
herself
like
a
frightened
child
coming
to
its
mother
her
companions
were
there
and
she
felt
it
to
be
remarkable
how
in
the
presence
of
his
agitation
his
mere
scared
exposed
nature
she
suddenly
ceased
to
mind
it
came
to
her
as
it
had
never
come
to
her
before
that
with
absolute
directness
and
assurance
they
might
carry
almost
anything
off
he
had
nothing
to
send
she
was
sure
he
had
been
wiring
all
over
and
yet
his
business
was
evidently
huge
there
was
nothing
but
that
in
his
eyes
not
a
glimmer
of
reference
or
memory
he
was
almost
haggard
with
anxiety
and
had
clearly
not
slept
a
wink
her
pity
for
him
would
have
given
her
any
courage
and
she
seemed
to
know
at
last
why
she
had
been
such
a
fool
she
did
come
she
panted
oh
yes
she
came
but
there
has
been
some
mistake
we
want
a
telegram
a
telegram
one
that
was
sent
from
here
ever
so
long
ago
there
was
something
in
it
that
has
to
be
recovered
something
very
very
important
please
we
want
it
immediately
he
really
spoke
to
her
as
if
she
had
been
some
strange
young
woman
at
knightsbridge
or
paddington
but
it
had
no
other
effect
on
her
than
to
give
her
the
measure
of
his
tremendous
flurry
then
it
was
that
above
all
she
felt
how
much
she
had
missed
in
the
gaps
and
blanks
and
absent
answers
how
much
she
had
had
to
dispense
with
it
was
now
black
darkness
save
for
this
little
wild
red
flare
so
much
as
that
she
saw
so
much
her
mind
dealt
with
one
of
the
lovers
was
quaking
somewhere
out
of
town
and
the
other
was
quaking
just
where
he
stood
this
was
vivid
enough
and
after
an
instant
she
knew
it
was
all
she
wanted
she
wanted
no
detail
no
fact
she
wanted
no
nearer
vision
of
discovery
or
shame
when
was
your
telegram
do
you
mean
you
sent
it
from
here
she
tried
to
do
the
young
woman
at
knightsbridge
oh
yes
from
here
several
weeks
ago
five
six
seven
he
was
confused
and
impatient
do
you
remember
remember
she
could
scarcely
keep
out
of
her
face
at
the
word
the
strangest
of
smiles
but
the
way
he
did
catch
what
it
meant
was
perhaps
even
stranger
still
i
mean
do
you
keep
the
old
ones
for
a
certain
time
but
how
long
she
thought
she
must
do
the
young
woman
and
she
knew
exactly
what
the
young
woman
would
say
and
still
more
would
can
you
give
me
the
date
oh
god
no
it
was
some
time
or
other
in
august
toward
the
end
it
was
to
the
same
address
as
the
one
i
gave
you
last
night
oh
said
the
girl
knowing
at
this
the
deepest
thrill
she
had
ever
felt
it
came
to
her
there
with
her
eyes
on
his
face
that
she
held
the
whole
thing
in
her
hand
held
it
as
she
held
her
pencil
which
might
have
broken
at
that
instant
in
her
tightened
grip
this
made
her
feel
like
the
very
fountain
of
fate
but
the
emotion
was
such
a
flood
that
she
had
to
press
it
back
with
all
her
force
that
was
positively
the
reason
again
of
her
paddington
tone
you
ca
give
us
anything
a
little
nearer
her
little
and
her
us
came
straight
from
paddington
these
things
were
no
false
note
for
him
his
difficulty
absorbed
them
all
the
eyes
with
which
he
pressed
her
and
in
the
depths
of
which
she
read
terror
and
rage
and
literal
tears
were
just
the
same
he
would
have
shown
any
other
prim
person
i
do
know
the
date
i
only
know
the
thing
went
from
here
and
just
about
the
time
i
speak
of
it
was
delivered
you
see
we
got
to
recover
it
chapter
xxiii
she
was
as
struck
with
the
beauty
of
his
plural
pronoun
as
she
had
judged
he
might
be
with
that
of
her
own
but
she
knew
now
so
well
what
she
was
about
that
she
could
almost
play
with
him
and
with
her
joy
you
say
the
time
you
speak
of
but
i
do
think
you
speak
of
an
exact
time
do
you
he
looked
splendidly
helpless
that
just
what
i
want
to
find
out
do
you
keep
the
old
ones
ca
you
look
it
up
our
young
lady
still
at
paddington
turned
the
question
over
it
was
delivered
yes
it
yet
at
the
same
time
do
you
know
it
was
he
just
hung
back
but
he
brought
it
out
i
mean
it
was
intercepted
you
know
and
there
was
something
in
it
he
paused
again
and
as
if
to
further
his
quest
and
woo
and
supplicate
success
and
recovery
even
smiled
with
an
effort
at
the
agreeable
that
was
almost
ghastly
and
that
turned
the
knife
in
her
tenderness
what
must
be
the
pain
of
it
all
of
the
open
gulf
and
the
throbbing
fever
when
this
was
the
mere
hot
breath
we
want
to
get
what
was
in
it
to
know
what
it
was
i
see
i
see
she
managed
just
the
accent
they
had
at
paddington
when
they
stared
like
dead
fish
and
you
have
no
clue
not
at
all
i
the
clue
i
just
given
you
oh
the
last
of
august
if
she
kept
it
up
long
enough
she
would
make
him
really
angry
yes
and
the
address
as
i
said
oh
the
same
as
last
night
he
visibly
quivered
as
with
a
gleam
of
hope
but
it
only
poured
oil
on
her
quietude
and
she
was
still
deliberate
she
ranged
some
papers
wo
you
look
he
went
on
i
remember
your
coming
she
replied
he
blinked
with
a
new
uneasiness
it
might
have
begun
to
come
to
him
through
her
difference
that
he
was
somehow
different
himself
you
were
much
quicker
then
you
know
so
were
you
you
must
do
me
that
justice
she
answered
with
a
smile
but
let
me
see
was
it
dover
yes
miss
dolman
parade
lodge
parade
terrace
exactly
thank
you
so
awfully
much
he
began
to
hope
again
then
you
it
the
other
one
she
hesitated
afresh
she
quite
dangled
him
it
was
brought
by
a
lady
yes
and
she
put
in
by
mistake
something
wrong
that
what
we
got
to
get
hold
of
heavens
what
was
he
going
to
say
flooding
poor
paddington
with
wild
betrayals
she
could
too
much
for
her
joy
dangle
him
yet
she
could
either
for
his
dignity
warn
or
control
or
check
him
what
she
found
herself
doing
was
just
to
treat
herself
to
the
middle
way
it
was
intercepted
it
fell
into
the
wrong
hands
but
there
something
in
it
he
continued
to
blurt
out
that
be
all
right
that
is
if
wrong
do
you
know
it
all
right
if
it
wrong
he
remarkably
explained
what
he
on
earth
going
to
say
buckton
and
the
were
already
interested
no
one
would
have
the
decency
to
come
in
and
she
was
divided
between
her
particular
terror
for
him
and
her
general
curiosity
yet
she
already
saw
with
what
brilliancy
she
could
add
to
carry
the
thing
off
a
little
false
knowledge
to
all
her
real
i
quite
understand
she
said
with
benevolent
with
almost
patronising
quickness
the
lady
has
forgotten
what
she
did
put
forgotten
most
wretchedly
and
it
an
immense
inconvenience
it
has
only
just
been
found
that
it
did
get
there
so
that
if
we
could
immediately
have
it
immediately
every
minute
counts
you
have
he
pleaded
surely
got
them
on
file
so
that
you
can
see
it
on
the
spot
yes
please
this
very
minute
the
counter
rang
with
his
knuckles
with
the
knob
of
his
stick
with
his
panic
of
alarm
do
hunt
it
up
he
repeated
i
dare
say
we
could
get
it
for
you
the
girl
weetly
returned
get
it
he
looked
aghast
when
probably
by
then
it
is
here
his
face
was
pitiful
she
caught
only
the
uncovered
gleams
that
peeped
out
of
the
blackness
and
she
wondered
what
complication
even
among
the
most
supposable
the
very
worst
could
be
bad
enough
to
account
for
the
degree
of
his
terror
there
were
twists
and
turns
there
were
places
where
the
screw
drew
blood
that
she
could
guess
she
was
more
and
more
glad
she
want
to
it
has
been
sent
on
but
how
do
you
know
if
you
do
look
she
gave
him
a
smile
that
was
meant
to
be
in
the
absolute
irony
of
its
propriety
quite
divine
it
was
august
and
we
nothing
later
here
than
august
something
leaped
into
his
face
then
you
sure
you
know
she
felt
she
scarce
knew
what
as
if
she
might
soon
be
pounced
upon
for
some
lurid
connexion
with
a
scandal
it
was
the
queerest
of
all
sensations
for
she
had
heard
she
had
read
of
these
things
and
the
wealth
of
her
intimacy
with
them
at
cocker
might
be
supposed
to
have
schooled
and
seasoned
her
this
particular
one
that
she
had
really
quite
lived
with
was
after
all
an
old
story
yet
what
it
had
been
before
was
dim
and
distant
beside
the
touch
under
which
she
now
winced
scandal
it
had
never
been
but
a
silly
word
now
it
was
a
great
tense
surface
and
the
surface
was
somehow
captain
everard
wonderful
face
deep
down
in
his
eyes
a
picture
a
scene
a
great
place
like
a
chamber
of
justice
where
before
a
watching
crowd
a
poor
girl
exposed
but
heroic
swore
with
a
quavering
voice
to
a
document
proved
an
supplied
a
link
in
this
picture
she
bravely
took
her
place
it
was
the
then
ca
you
get
it
this
morning
or
some
time
she
considered
still
holding
him
with
her
look
which
she
then
turned
on
her
two
companions
who
were
by
this
time
unreservedly
enlisted
she
did
care
not
a
scrap
and
she
glanced
about
for
a
piece
of
paper
with
this
she
had
to
recognise
the
rigour
of
official
thrift
a
morsel
of
blackened
blotter
was
the
only
loose
paper
to
be
seen
have
you
got
a
card
she
said
to
her
visitor
he
was
quite
away
from
paddington
now
and
the
next
instant
in
hand
he
had
whipped
a
card
out
she
gave
no
glance
at
the
name
on
it
only
turned
it
to
the
other
side
she
continued
to
hold
him
she
felt
at
present
as
she
had
never
held
him
and
her
command
of
her
colleagues
was
for
the
moment
not
less
marked
she
wrote
something
on
the
back
of
the
card
and
pushed
it
across
to
him
he
fairly
glared
at
it
seven
nine
four
nine
six
one
she
obligingly
completed
the
number
is
it
right
she
smiled
he
took
the
whole
thing
in
with
a
flushed
intensity
then
there
broke
out
in
him
a
visibility
of
relief
that
was
simply
a
tremendous
exposure
he
shone
at
them
all
like
a
tall
lighthouse
embracing
even
for
sympathy
the
blinking
young
men
by
all
the
powers
it
and
without
another
look
without
a
word
of
thanks
without
time
for
anything
or
anybody
he
turned
on
them
the
broad
back
of
his
great
stature
straightened
his
triumphant
shoulders
and
strode
out
of
the
place
she
was
left
confronted
with
her
habitual
critics
it
wrong
all
right
she
extravagantly
quoted
to
them
the
was
really
but
how
did
you
know
dear
i
remembered
love
buckton
on
the
contrary
was
rude
and
what
game
is
that
miss
no
happiness
she
had
ever
known
came
within
miles
of
it
and
some
minutes
elapsed
before
she
could
recall
herself
sufficiently
to
reply
that
it
was
none
of
his
business
chapter
xxiv
if
life
at
cocker
with
the
dreadful
drop
of
august
had
lost
something
of
its
savour
she
had
not
been
slow
to
infer
that
a
heavier
blight
had
fallen
on
the
graceful
industry
of
jordan
with
lord
rye
and
lady
ventnor
and
bubb
all
out
of
town
with
the
blinds
down
on
all
the
homes
of
luxury
this
ingenious
woman
might
well
have
found
her
wonderful
taste
left
quite
on
her
hands
she
bore
up
however
in
a
way
that
began
by
exciting
much
of
her
young
esteem
they
perhaps
even
more
frequently
met
as
the
wine
of
life
flowed
less
free
from
other
sources
and
each
in
the
lack
of
better
diversion
carried
on
with
more
mystification
for
the
other
an
intercourse
that
consisted
not
a
little
in
peeping
out
and
drawing
back
each
waited
for
the
other
to
commit
herself
each
profusely
curtained
for
the
other
the
limits
of
low
horizons
jordan
was
indeed
probably
the
more
reckless
skirmisher
nothing
could
exceed
her
frequent
incoherence
unless
it
was
indeed
her
occasional
bursts
of
confidence
her
account
of
her
private
affairs
rose
and
fell
like
a
flame
in
the
wind
sometimes
the
bravest
bonfire
and
sometimes
a
handful
of
ashes
this
our
young
woman
took
to
be
an
effect
of
the
position
at
one
moment
and
another
of
the
famous
door
of
the
great
world
she
had
been
struck
in
one
of
her
volumes
with
the
translation
of
a
french
proverb
according
to
which
such
a
door
any
door
had
to
be
either
open
or
shut
and
it
seemed
part
of
the
precariousness
of
jordan
life
that
hers
mostly
managed
to
be
neither
there
had
been
occasions
when
it
appeared
to
gape
wide
fairly
to
woo
her
across
its
threshold
there
had
been
others
of
an
order
distinctly
disconcerting
when
it
was
all
but
banged
in
her
face
on
the
whole
however
she
had
evidently
not
lost
heart
these
still
belonged
to
the
class
of
things
in
spite
of
which
she
looked
well
she
intimated
that
the
profits
of
her
trade
had
swollen
so
as
to
float
her
through
any
state
of
the
tide
and
she
had
besides
this
a
hundred
profundities
and
explanations
she
rose
superior
above
all
on
the
happy
fact
that
there
were
always
gentlemen
in
town
and
that
gentlemen
were
her
greatest
admirers
gentlemen
from
the
city
in
especial
as
to
whom
she
was
full
of
information
about
the
passion
and
pride
excited
in
such
breasts
by
the
elements
of
her
charming
commerce
the
city
men
did
in
short
go
in
for
flowers
there
was
a
certain
type
of
awfully
smart
stockbroker
lord
rye
called
them
jews
and
bounders
but
she
did
care
whose
extravagance
she
more
than
once
threw
out
had
really
if
one
had
any
conscience
to
be
forcibly
restrained
it
was
not
perhaps
a
pure
love
of
beauty
it
was
a
matter
of
vanity
and
a
sign
of
business
they
wished
to
crush
their
rivals
and
that
was
one
of
their
weapons
jordan
shrewdness
was
extreme
she
knew
in
any
case
her
customer
she
dealt
as
she
said
with
all
sorts
and
it
was
at
the
worst
a
race
for
her
a
race
even
in
the
dull
months
from
one
set
of
chambers
to
another
and
then
after
all
there
were
also
still
the
ladies
the
ladies
of
stockbroking
circles
were
perpetually
up
and
down
they
were
not
quite
perhaps
bubb
or
lady
ventnor
but
you
could
tell
the
difference
unless
you
quarrelled
with
them
and
then
you
knew
it
only
by
their
sooner
these
ladies
formed
the
branch
of
her
subject
on
which
she
most
swayed
in
the
breeze
to
that
degree
that
her
confidant
had
ended
with
an
inference
or
two
tending
to
banish
regret
for
opportunities
not
embraced
there
were
indeed
that
jordan
described
but
were
not
the
whole
of
respectability
and
it
was
odd
that
a
clergyman
widow
should
sometimes
speak
as
if
she
almost
thought
so
she
came
back
it
was
true
unfailingly
to
lord
rye
never
evidently
quite
losing
sight
of
him
even
on
the
longest
excursions
that
he
was
kindness
itself
had
become
in
fact
the
very
moral
it
all
pointed
pointed
in
strange
flashes
of
the
poor
woman
nearsighted
eyes
she
launched
at
her
young
friend
portentous
looks
solemn
heralds
of
some
extraordinary
communication
the
communication
itself
from
week
to
week
hung
fire
but
it
was
to
the
facts
over
which
it
hovered
that
she
owed
her
power
of
going
on
they
are
in
one
way
and
another
she
often
emphasised
a
tower
of
strength
and
as
the
allusion
was
to
the
aristocracy
the
girl
could
quite
wonder
why
if
they
were
so
in
one
way
they
should
require
to
be
so
in
two
she
thoroughly
knew
however
how
many
ways
jordan
counted
in
it
all
meant
simply
that
her
fate
was
pressing
her
close
if
that
fate
was
to
be
sealed
at
the
matrimonial
altar
it
was
perhaps
not
remarkable
that
she
should
come
all
at
once
to
the
scratch
of
overwhelming
a
mere
telegraphist
it
would
necessarily
present
to
such
a
person
a
prospect
of
regretful
sacrifice
lord
rye
if
it
lord
rye
would
be
kind
to
a
nonentity
of
that
sort
even
though
people
quite
as
good
had
been
one
sunday
afternoon
in
november
they
went
by
arrangement
to
church
together
after
which
on
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
the
arrangement
had
not
included
it
they
proceeded
to
jordan
lodging
in
the
region
of
maida
vale
she
had
raved
to
her
friend
about
her
service
of
predilection
she
was
excessively
high
and
had
more
than
once
wished
to
introduce
the
girl
to
the
same
comfort
and
privilege
there
was
a
thick
brown
fog
and
maida
vale
tasted
of
acrid
smoke
but
they
had
been
sitting
among
chants
and
incense
and
wonderful
music
during
which
though
the
effect
of
such
things
on
her
mind
was
great
our
young
lady
had
indulged
in
a
series
of
reflexions
but
indirectly
related
to
them
one
of
these
was
the
result
of
jordan
having
said
to
her
on
the
way
and
with
a
certain
fine
significance
that
lord
rye
had
been
for
some
time
in
town
she
had
spoken
as
if
it
were
a
circumstance
to
which
little
required
to
be
added
as
if
the
bearing
of
such
an
item
on
her
life
might
easily
be
grasped
perhaps
it
was
the
wonder
of
whether
lord
rye
wished
to
marry
her
that
made
her
guest
with
thoughts
straying
to
that
quarter
quite
determine
that
some
other
nuptials
also
should
take
place
at
saint
julian
mudge
was
still
an
attendant
at
his
wesleyan
chapel
but
this
was
the
least
of
her
worries
it
had
never
even
vexed
her
enough
for
her
to
so
much
as
name
it
to
jordan
mudge
form
of
worship
was
one
of
several
things
they
made
up
in
superiority
and
beauty
for
what
they
wanted
in
number
that
she
had
long
ago
settled
he
should
take
from
her
and
she
had
now
moreover
for
the
first
time
definitely
established
her
own
its
principal
feature
was
that
it
was
to
be
the
same
as
that
of
jordan
and
lord
rye
which
was
indeed
very
much
what
she
said
to
her
hostess
as
they
sat
together
later
on
the
brown
fog
was
in
this
hostess
little
parlour
where
it
acted
as
a
postponement
of
the
question
of
there
being
besides
anything
else
than
the
teacups
and
a
pewter
pot
and
a
very
black
little
fire
and
a
paraffin
lamp
without
a
shade
there
was
at
any
rate
no
sign
of
a
flower
it
was
not
for
herself
jordan
gathered
sweets
the
girl
waited
till
they
had
had
a
cup
of
tea
waited
for
the
announcement
that
she
fairly
believed
her
friend
had
this
time
possessed
herself
of
her
formally
at
last
to
make
but
nothing
came
after
the
interval
save
a
little
poke
at
the
fire
which
was
like
the
clearing
of
a
throat
for
a
speech
chapter
xxv
i
think
you
must
have
heard
me
speak
of
mr
drake
jordan
had
never
looked
so
queer
nor
her
smile
so
suggestive
of
a
large
benevolent
bite
drake
oh
yes
is
he
a
friend
of
lord
rye
a
great
and
trusted
friend
almost
i
may
say
a
loved
friend
jordan
almost
had
such
an
oddity
that
her
companion
was
moved
rather
flippantly
perhaps
to
take
it
up
do
people
as
good
as
love
their
friends
when
they
i
trust
them
it
pulled
up
a
little
the
eulogist
of
drake
well
my
dear
i
love
but
you
do
trust
me
the
girl
unmercifully
asked
again
jordan
paused
still
she
looked
queer
yes
she
replied
with
a
certain
austerity
that
exactly
what
i
about
to
give
you
rather
a
remarkable
proof
of
the
sense
of
its
being
remarkable
was
already
so
strong
that
while
she
bridled
a
little
this
held
her
auditor
in
a
momentary
muteness
of
submission
drake
has
rendered
his
lordship
for
several
years
services
that
his
lordship
has
highly
appreciated
and
that
make
it
all
the
more
a
unexpected
that
they
should
perhaps
a
little
suddenly
separate
separate
our
young
lady
was
mystified
but
she
tried
to
be
interested
and
she
already
saw
that
she
had
put
the
saddle
on
the
wrong
horse
she
had
heard
something
of
drake
who
was
a
member
of
his
lordship
circle
the
member
with
whom
apparently
avocations
had
most
happened
to
throw
her
she
was
only
a
little
puzzled
at
the
separation
well
at
any
rate
she
smiled
if
they
separate
as
friends
oh
his
lordship
takes
the
greatest
interest
in
drake
future
do
anything
for
him
he
has
in
fact
just
done
a
great
deal
there
you
know
be
changes
no
one
knows
it
better
than
i
the
girl
said
she
wished
to
draw
her
interlocutress
out
there
will
be
changes
enough
for
me
you
leaving
cocker
the
ornament
of
that
establishment
waited
a
moment
to
answer
and
then
it
was
indirect
tell
me
what
doing
well
what
will
you
think
of
it
why
that
you
found
the
opening
you
were
always
so
sure
of
jordan
on
this
appeared
to
muse
with
embarrassed
intensity
i
was
always
sure
yes
and
yet
i
often
was
well
i
hope
you
sure
now
sure
i
mean
of
mr
drake
yes
my
dear
i
think
i
may
say
i
i
kept
him
going
till
i
was
then
he
yours
my
very
own
how
nice
and
awfully
rich
our
young
woman
went
on
jordan
showed
promptly
enough
that
she
loved
for
higher
things
awfully
handsome
six
foot
two
and
he
put
by
quite
like
mudge
then
that
gentleman
friend
rather
desperately
exclaimed
oh
not
quite
drake
was
ambiguous
about
it
but
the
name
of
mudge
had
evidently
given
her
some
sort
of
stimulus
he
have
more
opportunity
now
at
any
rate
he
going
to
lady
bradeen
to
lady
bradeen
this
was
bewilderment
the
girl
had
seen
from
the
way
jordan
looked
at
her
that
the
effect
of
the
name
had
been
to
make
her
let
something
out
do
you
know
her
she
floundered
but
she
found
her
feet
well
you
remember
often
told
you
that
if
you
grand
clients
i
have
them
too
yes
said
jordan
but
the
great
difference
is
that
you
hate
yours
whereas
i
really
love
mine
you
know
lady
bradeen
she
pursued
down
to
the
ground
she
always
in
and
out
jordan
foolish
eyes
confessed
in
fixing
themselves
on
this
sketch
to
a
degree
of
wonder
and
even
of
envy
but
she
bore
up
and
with
a
certain
gaiety
do
you
hate
she
demanded
her
visitor
reply
was
prompt
dear
no
not
nearly
so
much
as
some
of
them
she
too
outrageously
beautiful
jordan
continued
to
gaze
outrageously
well
yes
deliciously
what
was
really
delicious
was
vagueness
you
do
know
her
you
not
seen
her
her
guest
lightly
continued
no
but
i
heard
a
great
deal
about
her
so
have
i
our
young
lady
exclaimed
jordan
looked
an
instant
as
if
she
suspected
her
good
faith
or
at
least
her
seriousness
you
know
some
friend
of
lady
bradeen
oh
yes
i
know
one
only
one
the
girl
laughed
out
only
one
but
he
so
intimate
jordan
just
hesitated
he
a
gentleman
yes
he
not
a
lady
her
interlocutress
appeared
to
muse
she
immensely
surrounded
she
be
with
mr
drake
jordan
gaze
became
strangely
fixed
is
she
the
handsomest
person
i
know
jordan
continued
to
brood
well
i
know
some
beauties
then
with
her
odd
jerkiness
do
you
think
she
looks
because
that
not
always
the
case
with
the
the
other
took
it
up
no
indeed
it
is
that
one
thing
cocker
has
taught
me
still
there
are
some
people
who
have
everything
lady
bradeen
at
any
rate
has
enough
eyes
and
a
nose
and
a
mouth
a
complexion
a
figure
a
figure
jordan
almost
broke
in
a
figure
a
head
of
hair
the
girl
made
a
little
conscious
motion
that
seemed
to
let
the
hair
all
down
and
her
companion
watched
the
wonderful
show
but
drake
another
another
mrs
jordan
thoughts
had
to
come
back
from
a
distance
of
her
ladyship
admirers
he
you
say
to
her
at
this
jordan
really
faltered
she
has
engaged
him
engaged
him
our
young
woman
was
quite
at
sea
in
the
same
capacity
as
lord
rye
and
was
lord
rye
engaged
chapter
xxvi
jordan
looked
away
from
her
now
looked
she
thought
rather
injured
and
as
if
trifled
with
even
a
little
angry
the
mention
of
lady
bradeen
had
frustrated
for
a
while
the
convergence
of
our
thoughts
but
with
this
impression
of
her
old
friend
combined
impatience
and
diffidence
they
began
again
to
whirl
round
her
and
continued
it
till
one
of
them
appeared
to
dart
at
her
out
of
the
dance
as
if
with
a
sharp
peck
it
came
to
her
with
a
lively
shock
with
a
positive
sting
that
drake
was
could
it
be
possible
with
the
idea
she
found
herself
afresh
on
the
edge
of
laughter
of
a
sudden
and
strange
perversity
of
mirth
drake
loomed
in
a
swift
image
before
her
such
a
figure
as
she
had
seen
in
open
doorways
of
houses
in
quarter
majestic
erect
flanked
on
either
side
by
a
footman
and
taking
the
name
of
a
visitor
drake
then
verily
a
person
who
opened
the
door
before
she
had
time
however
to
recover
from
the
effect
of
her
evocation
she
was
offered
a
vision
which
quite
engulfed
it
it
was
communicated
to
her
somehow
that
the
face
with
which
she
had
seen
it
rise
prompted
jordan
to
dash
a
bit
wildly
at
something
at
anything
that
might
attenuate
criticism
lady
she
going
to
be
married
married
the
girl
echoed
it
ever
so
softly
but
there
it
was
at
last
did
you
know
it
she
summoned
all
her
sturdiness
no
she
has
told
me
and
her
friends
have
they
i
have
seen
any
of
them
lately
i
not
so
fortunate
as
you
jordan
gathered
herself
then
you
have
even
heard
of
lord
bradeen
death
her
comrade
unable
for
a
moment
to
speak
gave
a
slow
headshake
you
know
it
from
mr
drake
it
was
better
surely
not
to
learn
things
at
all
than
to
learn
them
by
the
butler
she
tells
him
everything
and
he
tells
i
see
our
young
lady
got
up
recovering
her
muff
and
her
gloves
she
smiled
well
i
have
unfortunately
any
drake
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
even
without
your
sort
of
assistance
however
there
a
trifle
here
and
there
that
i
do
pick
up
i
gather
that
if
she
to
marry
any
one
it
must
quite
necessarily
be
my
friend
jordan
was
now
also
on
her
feet
is
captain
everard
your
friend
the
girl
considered
drawing
on
a
glove
i
saw
at
one
time
an
immense
deal
of
him
jordan
looked
hard
at
the
glove
but
she
had
after
all
waited
for
that
to
be
sorry
it
was
cleaner
what
time
was
that
it
must
have
been
the
time
you
were
seeing
so
much
of
mr
drake
she
had
now
fairly
taken
it
in
the
distinguished
person
jordan
was
to
marry
would
answer
bells
and
put
on
coals
and
superintend
at
least
the
cleaning
of
boots
for
the
other
distinguished
person
whom
she
might
well
whom
she
might
have
had
if
she
had
wished
so
much
more
to
say
to
bye
she
added
jordan
however
again
taking
her
muff
from
her
turned
it
over
brushed
it
off
and
thoughtfully
peeped
into
it
tell
me
this
before
you
go
you
spoke
just
now
of
your
own
changes
do
you
mean
that
mr
mudge
mudge
has
had
great
patience
with
me
he
has
brought
me
at
last
to
the
point
we
to
be
married
next
month
and
have
a
nice
little
home
but
he
only
a
grocer
you
know
the
girl
met
her
friend
intent
eyes
so
that
i
afraid
that
with
the
set
you
got
into
you
see
your
way
to
keep
up
our
friendship
jordan
for
a
moment
made
no
answer
to
this
she
only
held
the
muff
up
to
her
face
after
which
she
gave
it
back
you
do
like
it
i
see
i
see
to
her
guest
astonishment
there
were
tears
now
in
her
eyes
i
like
what
the
girl
asked
why
my
engagement
only
with
your
great
cleverness
the
poor
lady
quavered
out
you
put
it
in
your
own
way
i
mean
that
you
cool
off
you
already
have
and
on
this
the
next
instant
her
tears
began
to
flow
she
succumbed
to
them
and
collapsed
she
sank
down
again
burying
her
face
and
trying
to
smother
her
sobs
her
young
friend
stood
there
still
in
some
rigour
but
taken
much
by
surprise
even
if
not
yet
fully
moved
to
pity
i
do
put
anything
in
any
and
i
very
glad
you
suited
only
you
know
you
did
put
to
me
so
splendidly
what
even
for
me
if
i
had
listened
to
you
it
might
lead
to
jordan
kept
up
a
mild
thin
weak
wail
then
drying
her
eyes
as
feebly
considered
this
reminder
it
has
led
to
my
not
starving
she
faintly
gasped
our
young
lady
at
this
dropped
into
the
place
beside
her
and
now
in
a
rush
the
small
silly
misery
was
clear
she
took
her
hand
as
a
sign
of
pitying
it
then
after
another
instant
confirmed
this
expression
with
a
consoling
kiss
they
sat
there
together
they
looked
out
hand
in
hand
into
the
damp
dusky
shabby
little
room
and
into
the
future
of
no
such
very
different
suggestion
at
last
accepted
by
each
there
was
no
definite
utterance
on
either
side
of
drake
position
in
the
great
world
but
the
temporary
collapse
of
his
prospective
bride
threw
all
further
necessary
light
and
what
our
heroine
saw
and
felt
for
in
the
whole
business
was
the
vivid
reflexion
of
her
own
dreams
and
delusions
and
her
own
return
to
reality
reality
for
the
poor
things
they
both
were
could
only
be
ugliness
and
obscurity
could
never
be
the
escape
the
rise
she
pressed
her
friend
she
had
tact
enough
for
that
with
no
other
personal
question
brought
on
no
need
of
further
revelations
only
just
continued
to
hold
and
comfort
her
and
to
acknowledge
by
stiff
little
forbearances
the
common
element
in
their
fate
she
felt
indeed
magnanimous
in
such
matters
since
if
it
was
very
well
for
condolence
or
reassurance
to
suppress
just
then
invidious
shrinkings
she
yet
by
no
means
saw
herself
sitting
down
as
she
might
say
to
the
same
table
with
drake
there
would
luckily
to
all
appearance
be
little
question
of
tables
and
the
circumstance
that
on
their
peculiar
lines
her
interests
would
still
attach
themselves
to
mayfair
flung
over
chalk
farm
the
first
radiance
it
had
shown
where
was
one
pride
and
one
passion
when
the
real
way
to
judge
of
one
luck
was
by
making
not
the
wrong
but
the
right
comparison
before
she
had
again
gathered
herself
to
go
she
felt
very
small
and
cautious
and
thankful
we
shall
have
our
own
house
she
said
and
you
must
come
very
soon
and
let
me
show
it
you
shall
have
our
own
too
jordan
replied
for
do
you
know
he
makes
it
a
condition
that
he
sleeps
out
a
condition
the
girl
felt
out
of
it
for
any
new
position
it
was
on
that
he
parted
with
lord
rye
his
lordship
ca
meet
it
so
drake
has
given
him
up
and
all
for
you
our
young
woman
put
it
as
cheerfully
as
possible
for
me
and
lady
bradeen
her
ladyship
too
glad
to
get
him
at
any
price
lord
rye
out
of
interest
in
us
has
in
fact
quite
her
take
him
so
as
i
tell
you
he
will
have
his
own
establishment
jordan
in
the
elation
of
it
had
begun
to
revive
but
there
was
nevertheless
between
them
rather
a
conscious
pause
a
pause
in
which
neither
visitor
nor
hostess
brought
out
a
hope
or
an
invitation
it
expressed
in
the
last
resort
that
in
spite
of
submission
and
sympathy
they
could
now
after
all
only
look
at
each
other
across
the
social
gulf
they
remained
together
as
if
it
would
be
indeed
their
last
chance
still
sitting
though
awkwardly
quite
close
and
feeling
also
and
this
most
unmistakeably
that
there
was
one
thing
more
to
go
into
by
the
time
it
came
to
the
surface
moreover
our
young
friend
had
recognised
the
whole
of
the
main
truth
from
which
she
even
drew
again
a
slight
irritation
it
was
not
the
main
truth
perhaps
that
most
signified
but
after
her
momentary
effort
her
embarrassment
and
her
tears
jordan
had
begun
to
sound
afresh
and
even
without
speaking
the
note
of
a
social
connexion
she
had
really
let
go
of
it
that
she
was
marrying
into
society
well
it
was
a
harmless
compensation
and
it
was
all
the
prospective
bride
of
mudge
had
to
leave
with
her
chapter
xxvii
this
young
lady
at
last
rose
again
but
she
lingered
before
going
and
has
captain
everard
nothing
to
say
to
it
to
what
dear
why
to
such
questions
the
domestic
arrangements
things
in
the
house
how
can
he
with
any
authority
when
nothing
in
the
house
is
his
not
his
the
girl
wondered
perfectly
conscious
of
the
appearance
she
thus
conferred
on
jordan
of
knowing
in
comparison
with
herself
so
tremendously
much
about
it
well
there
were
things
she
wanted
so
to
get
at
that
she
was
willing
at
last
though
it
hurt
her
to
pay
for
them
with
humiliation
why
are
they
not
his
do
you
know
dear
that
he
has
nothing
nothing
it
was
hard
to
see
him
in
such
a
light
but
power
to
answer
for
it
had
a
superiority
that
began
on
the
spot
to
grow
is
he
rich
jordan
looked
immensely
looked
both
generally
and
particularly
informed
it
depends
upon
what
you
call
not
at
any
rate
in
the
least
as
she
is
what
does
he
bring
think
what
she
has
and
then
love
his
debts
his
debts
his
young
friend
was
fairly
betrayed
into
helpless
innocence
she
could
struggle
a
little
but
she
had
to
let
herself
go
and
if
she
had
spoken
frankly
she
would
have
said
do
tell
me
for
i
do
know
so
much
about
him
as
as
she
did
speak
frankly
she
only
said
his
debts
are
nothing
when
she
so
adores
him
jordan
began
to
fix
her
again
and
now
she
saw
that
she
must
only
take
it
all
that
was
what
it
had
come
to
his
having
sat
with
her
there
on
the
bench
and
under
the
trees
in
the
summer
darkness
and
put
his
hand
on
her
making
her
know
what
he
would
have
said
if
permitted
his
having
returned
to
her
afterwards
repeatedly
with
supplicating
eyes
and
a
fever
in
his
blood
and
her
having
on
her
side
hard
and
pedantic
helped
by
some
miracle
and
with
her
impossible
condition
only
answered
him
yet
supplicating
back
through
the
bars
of
the
cage
all
simply
that
she
might
hear
of
him
now
for
ever
lost
only
through
jordan
who
touched
him
through
drake
who
reached
him
through
lady
bradeen
she
adores
him
but
of
course
that
was
all
there
was
about
it
the
girl
met
her
eyes
a
minute
then
quite
surrendered
what
was
there
else
about
it
why
do
you
know
mrs
jordan
was
almost
compassionate
her
interlocutress
had
in
the
cage
sounded
depths
but
there
was
a
suggestion
here
somehow
of
an
abyss
quite
measureless
of
course
i
know
she
would
never
let
him
alone
how
she
fancy
when
he
had
so
compromised
her
the
most
artless
cry
they
had
ever
uttered
broke
at
this
from
the
younger
pair
of
lips
he
so
why
do
you
know
the
scandal
our
heroine
thought
recollected
there
was
something
whatever
it
was
that
she
knew
after
all
much
more
of
than
jordan
she
saw
him
again
as
she
had
seen
him
come
that
morning
to
recover
the
telegram
she
saw
him
as
she
had
seen
him
leave
the
shop
she
perched
herself
a
moment
on
this
oh
there
was
nothing
public
not
exactly
public
no
but
there
was
an
awful
scare
and
an
awful
row
it
was
all
on
the
very
point
of
coming
out
something
was
lost
something
was
found
ah
yes
the
girl
replied
smiling
as
if
with
the
revival
of
a
blurred
memory
something
was
found
it
all
got
about
and
there
was
a
point
at
which
lord
bradeen
had
to
act
had
to
yes
but
he
did
jordan
was
obliged
to
admit
it
no
he
did
and
then
luckily
for
them
he
died
i
did
know
about
his
death
her
companion
said
it
was
nine
weeks
ago
and
most
sudden
it
has
given
them
a
prompt
chance
to
get
married
this
was
a
wonder
within
nine
weeks
oh
not
immediately
but
in
all
the
circumstances
very
quietly
and
i
assure
you
very
soon
every
preparation
made
above
all
she
holds
him
oh
yes
she
holds
him
our
young
friend
threw
off
she
had
this
before
her
again
a
minute
then
she
continued
you
mean
through
his
having
made
her
talked
about
yes
but
not
only
that
she
has
still
another
pull
another
jordan
hesitated
why
he
was
something
her
comrade
wondered
in
what
i
do
know
something
bad
as
i
tell
you
something
was
found
the
girl
stared
well
it
would
have
been
very
bad
for
him
but
she
helped
him
some
way
she
recovered
it
got
hold
of
it
it
even
said
she
stole
it
our
young
woman
considered
afresh
why
it
was
what
was
found
that
precisely
saved
him
jordan
however
was
positive
i
beg
your
pardon
i
happen
to
know
her
disciple
faltered
but
an
instant
do
you
mean
through
drake
do
they
tell
him
these
things
a
good
servant
said
jordan
now
thoroughly
superior
and
proportionately
sententious
does
need
to
be
told
her
ladyship
saved
as
a
woman
so
often
saves
the
man
she
loves
this
time
our
heroine
took
longer
to
recover
herself
but
she
found
a
voice
at
last
ah
well
of
course
i
do
know
the
great
thing
was
that
he
got
off
they
seem
then
in
a
manner
she
added
to
have
done
a
great
deal
for
each
other
well
it
she
that
has
done
most
she
has
him
tight
i
see
i
see
the
women
had
already
embraced
and
this
was
not
repeated
but
jordan
went
down
with
her
guest
to
the
door
of
the
house
here
again
the
younger
lingered
reverting
though
three
or
four
other
remarks
had
on
the
way
passed
between
them
to
captain
everard
and
lady
bradeen
did
you
mean
just
now
that
if
she
had
saved
him
as
you
call
it
she
would
hold
him
so
tight
well
i
dare
say
jordan
on
the
doorstep
smiled
with
a
reflexion
that
had
come
to
her
she
took
one
of
her
big
bites
of
the
brown
gloom
men
always
dislike
one
when
they
done
one
an
injury
but
what
injury
had
he
done
her
the
one
i
mentioned
he
marry
her
you
know
and
did
he
want
to
not
before
not
before
she
recovered
the
telegram
jordan
was
pulled
up
a
little
was
it
a
telegram
the
girl
hesitated
i
thought
you
said
so
i
mean
whatever
it
was
yes
whatever
it
was
i
do
think
she
saw
so
she
just
nailed
him
she
just
nailed
him
the
departing
friend
was
now
at
the
bottom
of
the
little
flight
of
steps
the
other
was
at
the
top
with
a
certain
thickness
of
fog
and
when
am
i
to
think
of
you
in
your
little
home
next
month
asked
the
voice
from
the
top
at
the
very
latest
and
when
am
i
to
think
of
you
in
yours
oh
even
sooner
i
feel
after
so
much
talk
with
you
about
it
as
if
i
were
already
there
then
came
out
of
the
fog
went
into
it
our
young
lady
went
into
it
also
in
the
opposed
quarter
and
presently
after
a
few
sightless
turns
came
out
on
the
paddington
canal
distinguishing
vaguely
what
the
low
parapet
enclosed
she
stopped
close
to
it
and
stood
a
while
very
intently
but
perhaps
still
sightlessly
looking
down
on
it
a
policeman
while
she
remained
strolled
past
her
then
going
his
way
a
little
further
and
half
lost
in
the
atmosphere
paused
and
watched
her
but
she
was
quite
unaware
she
was
full
of
her
thoughts
they
were
too
numerous
to
find
a
place
just
here
but
two
of
the
number
may
at
least
be
mentioned
one
of
these
was
that
decidedly
her
little
home
must
be
not
for
next
month
but
for
next
week
the
other
which
came
indeed
as
she
resumed
her
walk
and
went
her
way
was
that
it
was
strange
such
a
matter
should
be
at
last
settled
for
her
by
drake
