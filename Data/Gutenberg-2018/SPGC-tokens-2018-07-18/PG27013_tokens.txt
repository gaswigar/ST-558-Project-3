momentarily
then
hellhounds
of
the
cosmos
by
clifford
simak
weird
are
the
conditions
of
the
interdimensional
struggle
faced
by
white
men
the
paper
had
gone
to
press
graphically
describing
the
latest
of
the
many
horrible
events
which
had
been
enacted
upon
the
earth
in
the
last
six
months
the
headlines
screamed
that
six
corners
a
little
hamlet
in
pennsylvania
had
been
wiped
out
by
the
horror
another
story
told
of
a
terror
in
the
amazon
valley
which
had
sent
the
natives
down
the
river
in
babbling
fear
other
stories
told
of
deaths
here
and
there
all
attributable
to
the
black
horror
as
it
was
called
the
telephone
rang
hello
said
the
editor
london
calling
came
the
voice
of
the
operator
all
right
replied
the
editor
he
recognized
the
voice
of
terry
masters
special
correspondent
his
voice
came
clearly
over
the
transatlantic
telephone
the
horror
is
attacking
london
in
force
he
said
there
are
thousands
of
them
and
they
have
completely
surrounded
the
city
all
roads
are
blocked
the
government
declared
the
city
under
martial
rule
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
and
efforts
are
being
made
to
prepare
for
resistance
against
the
enemy
just
a
second
the
editor
shouted
into
the
transmitter
he
touched
a
button
on
his
desk
and
in
a
moment
an
answering
buzz
told
him
he
was
in
communication
with
the
stop
the
presses
he
yelled
into
the
speaking
tube
get
ready
for
a
new
front
came
faintly
through
the
tube
and
the
editor
turned
back
to
the
phone
now
let
have
it
he
said
and
the
voice
at
the
london
end
of
the
wire
droned
on
telling
the
story
that
in
another
half
hour
was
read
by
a
world
which
shuddered
in
cold
fear
even
as
it
scanned
the
glaring
headlines
woods
said
the
editor
of
the
to
a
reporter
run
over
and
talk
to
silas
white
he
phoned
me
to
send
someone
something
about
this
horror
business
henry
woods
rose
from
his
chair
without
a
word
and
walked
from
the
office
as
he
passed
the
wire
machine
it
was
tapping
out
with
a
maddeningly
methodical
slowness
the
story
of
the
fall
of
london
only
half
an
hour
before
it
had
rapped
forth
the
flashes
concerning
the
attack
on
paris
and
berlin
he
passed
out
of
the
building
into
a
street
that
was
swarming
with
terrified
humanity
six
months
of
terror
of
numerous
mysterious
deaths
of
villages
blotted
out
had
set
the
world
on
edge
now
with
london
in
possession
of
the
horror
and
paris
and
berlin
fighting
hopelessly
for
their
lives
the
entire
population
of
the
world
was
half
insane
with
fright
exhorters
on
street
corners
enlarged
upon
the
end
of
the
world
asking
that
the
people
prepare
for
eternity
attributing
the
horror
to
the
act
of
a
supreme
being
enraged
with
the
wickedness
of
the
earth
expecting
every
moment
an
attack
by
the
horror
people
left
their
work
and
gathered
in
the
streets
traffic
in
places
had
been
blocked
for
hours
and
law
and
order
were
practically
paralyzed
commerce
and
transportation
were
disrupted
as
people
fled
from
the
larger
cities
seeking
doubtful
hiding
places
in
rural
districts
from
the
death
that
stalked
the
land
a
loudspeaker
in
front
of
a
music
store
blared
forth
the
latest
news
flashes
it
has
been
learned
came
the
measured
tones
of
the
announcer
that
all
communication
with
berlin
ceased
about
ten
minutes
ago
at
paris
all
efforts
to
hold
the
horror
at
bay
have
been
futile
explosives
blow
it
apart
but
have
the
same
effect
upon
it
as
explosion
has
on
gas
it
flies
apart
and
then
reforms
again
not
always
in
the
same
shape
as
it
was
before
a
new
gas
one
of
the
most
deadly
ever
conceived
by
man
has
failed
to
have
any
effect
on
the
things
electric
guns
and
heat
guns
have
absolutely
no
effect
upon
them
a
news
flash
which
has
just
come
in
from
rome
says
that
a
large
number
of
the
horrors
has
been
sighted
north
of
that
city
by
airmen
it
seems
they
are
attacking
the
capitals
of
the
world
first
word
comes
from
washington
that
every
known
form
of
defense
is
being
amassed
at
that
city
new
york
is
also
preparing
henry
woods
fought
his
way
through
the
crowd
which
milled
in
front
of
the
loudspeaker
the
hum
of
excitement
was
giving
away
to
a
silence
the
silence
of
a
stunned
people
the
fearful
silence
of
a
populace
facing
a
presence
it
is
unable
to
understand
an
embattled
world
standing
with
useless
weapons
before
an
incomprehensible
enemy
in
despair
the
reporter
looked
about
for
a
taxi
but
realized
with
a
groan
of
resignation
that
no
taxi
could
possibly
operate
in
that
crowded
street
a
street
car
blocked
by
the
stream
of
humanity
which
jostled
and
elbowed
about
it
stood
still
a
defeated
thing
seemingly
the
only
man
with
a
definite
purpose
in
that
whirlpool
of
men
and
women
the
newspaperman
settled
down
to
the
serious
business
of
battling
his
way
through
the
swarming
street
before
i
go
to
the
crux
of
the
matter
said
silas
white
about
half
an
hour
later
let
us
first
review
what
we
know
of
this
horror
suppose
you
tell
me
exactly
what
you
know
of
it
henry
woods
shifted
uneasily
in
his
chair
why
did
the
old
fool
get
down
to
business
the
chief
would
raise
hell
if
this
story
did
make
the
regular
edition
he
stole
a
glance
at
his
there
was
still
almost
an
hour
left
maybe
he
could
manage
it
if
the
old
chap
would
only
snap
into
it
i
know
no
more
he
said
than
is
common
knowledge
the
gimlet
eyes
of
the
old
scientist
regarded
the
newspaperman
sharply
and
that
is
he
questioned
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
thought
henry
he
have
to
humor
the
old
fellow
the
horror
he
replied
appeared
on
earth
so
far
as
the
knowledge
of
man
is
concerned
about
six
months
ago
white
nodded
approvingly
you
state
the
facts
very
aptly
he
said
how
so
when
you
say
far
as
the
knowledge
of
man
is
concerned
why
is
that
you
will
understand
in
due
time
please
proceed
vaguely
the
newspaperman
wondered
whether
he
was
interviewing
the
scientist
or
the
scientist
interviewing
him
they
were
first
reported
woods
said
early
this
spring
at
that
time
they
wiped
out
a
small
village
in
the
province
of
quebec
all
the
inhabitants
except
a
few
fugitives
were
found
dead
killed
mysteriously
and
half
eaten
as
if
by
wild
beasts
the
fugitives
were
demented
babbling
of
black
shapes
that
swept
down
out
of
the
dark
forest
upon
the
little
town
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
the
next
that
was
heard
of
them
was
about
a
week
later
when
they
struck
in
an
isolated
rural
district
in
poland
killing
and
feeding
on
the
population
of
several
farms
in
the
next
week
more
villages
were
wiped
out
in
practically
every
country
on
the
face
of
the
earth
from
the
hinterlands
came
tales
of
murder
done
at
midnight
of
men
and
women
horribly
mangled
of
livestock
slaughtered
of
buildings
crushed
as
if
by
some
titanic
force
at
first
they
worked
only
at
night
and
then
seeming
to
become
bolder
and
more
numerous
attacked
in
broad
daylight
the
newspaperman
paused
is
that
what
you
want
he
asked
that
part
of
it
replied
white
but
that
not
all
what
do
these
horrors
look
like
that
more
difficult
said
henry
they
have
been
reported
as
every
conceivable
sort
of
monstrosity
some
are
large
and
others
are
small
some
take
the
form
of
animals
others
of
birds
and
reptiles
and
some
are
cast
in
appalling
shapes
such
as
might
be
snatched
out
of
the
horrid
imagery
of
a
thing
which
resided
in
a
world
entirely
alien
to
our
own
white
rose
from
his
chair
and
strode
across
the
room
to
confront
the
other
young
man
he
asked
do
you
think
it
possible
the
horror
might
have
come
out
of
a
world
entirely
alien
to
our
own
i
do
know
replied
henry
i
know
that
some
of
the
scientists
believe
they
came
from
some
other
planet
perhaps
even
from
some
other
solar
system
i
know
they
are
like
nothing
ever
known
before
on
earth
they
are
always
inky
black
something
like
black
tar
you
know
sort
of
a
disgusting
sight
the
weapons
of
mankind
ca
affect
them
explosives
are
useless
and
so
are
projectiles
they
wade
through
poison
gas
and
fiery
chemicals
and
seem
to
enjoy
them
elaborate
electrical
barriers
have
failed
heat
does
make
them
turn
a
hair
and
you
think
they
came
from
some
other
planet
perhaps
some
other
solar
system
i
do
know
what
to
think
said
henry
if
they
came
out
of
space
they
must
have
come
in
some
conveyance
and
that
would
certainly
have
been
sighted
picked
up
long
before
it
arrived
by
our
astronomers
if
they
came
in
small
conveyances
there
must
have
been
many
of
them
if
they
came
in
a
single
conveyance
it
would
be
too
large
to
escape
detection
that
is
unless
unless
what
snapped
the
scientist
unless
it
traveled
at
the
speed
of
light
then
it
would
have
been
invisible
not
only
invisible
snorted
the
old
man
but
a
question
was
on
the
tip
of
the
newspaperman
tongue
but
before
it
could
be
asked
the
old
man
was
speaking
again
asking
a
question
can
you
imagine
a
fourth
dimension
no
i
ca
said
henry
can
you
imagine
a
thing
of
only
two
dimensions
vaguely
yes
the
scientist
smote
his
palms
together
now
we
coming
to
it
he
exclaimed
henry
woods
regarded
the
other
narrowly
the
old
man
must
be
turned
what
did
fourth
and
second
dimensions
have
to
do
with
the
horror
do
you
know
anything
about
evolution
questioned
the
old
man
i
have
a
slight
understanding
of
it
it
is
the
process
of
upward
growth
the
stairs
by
which
simple
organisms
climb
to
become
more
complex
organisms
white
grunted
and
asked
still
another
question
do
you
know
anything
about
the
theory
of
the
exploding
universe
have
you
ever
noted
the
tendency
of
the
perfectly
balanced
to
run
amuck
the
reporter
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
white
he
said
you
phoned
my
paper
you
had
a
story
for
us
i
came
here
to
get
it
but
all
you
have
done
is
ask
me
questions
if
you
ca
tell
me
what
you
want
us
to
publish
i
will
say
the
doctor
put
forth
a
hand
that
shook
slightly
sit
down
young
man
he
said
i
do
blame
you
for
being
impatient
but
i
will
now
come
to
my
point
the
newspaperman
sat
down
again
i
have
developed
a
hypothesis
said
white
and
have
conducted
several
experiments
which
seem
to
bear
it
out
i
am
staking
my
reputation
upon
the
supposition
that
it
is
correct
not
only
that
but
i
am
also
staking
the
lives
of
several
brave
men
who
believe
implicitly
in
me
and
my
theory
after
all
i
suppose
it
makes
little
difference
for
if
i
fail
the
world
is
doomed
if
i
succeed
it
is
saved
from
complete
destruction
have
you
ever
thought
that
our
evolutionists
might
be
wrong
that
evolution
might
be
downward
instead
of
upward
the
theory
of
the
exploding
universe
the
belief
that
all
of
creation
is
running
down
being
thrown
off
balance
by
the
loss
of
energy
spurred
onward
by
cosmic
accidents
which
tend
to
disturb
its
equilibrium
to
a
time
when
it
will
run
wild
and
space
will
be
filled
with
swirling
dust
of
disintegrated
worlds
would
bear
out
this
contention
this
does
not
apply
to
the
human
race
there
is
no
question
that
our
evolution
is
upward
that
we
have
arisen
from
creatures
wallowing
in
the
slime
of
primal
seas
our
case
is
probably
paralleled
by
thousands
of
other
intelligences
on
planets
and
island
universes
these
instances
however
running
at
cross
purposes
to
the
general
evolutional
trend
of
the
entire
cosmos
are
mere
flashes
in
the
eventual
course
of
cosmic
evolution
comparing
no
more
to
eternity
than
a
split
second
does
to
a
million
years
taking
these
instances
then
as
inconsequential
let
us
say
that
the
trend
of
cosmic
evolution
is
downward
rather
than
upward
from
complex
units
to
simpler
units
rather
than
from
simple
units
to
more
complex
ones
let
us
say
that
life
and
intelligence
have
degenerated
how
would
you
say
such
a
degeneration
would
take
place
in
just
what
way
would
it
be
manifested
what
sort
of
transition
would
life
pass
through
in
passing
from
one
stage
to
a
lower
one
just
what
would
be
the
nature
of
these
stages
the
scientist
eyes
glowed
brightly
as
he
bent
forward
in
his
chair
the
newspaperman
said
simply
i
have
no
idea
man
cried
the
old
man
ca
you
see
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
dimensions
from
the
fourth
dimension
to
the
third
from
the
third
to
the
second
from
the
second
to
the
first
from
the
first
to
a
questionable
existence
or
plane
which
is
beyond
our
understanding
or
perhaps
to
oblivion
and
the
end
of
life
might
not
the
fourth
have
evolved
from
a
fifth
the
fifth
from
a
sixth
the
sixth
from
a
seventh
and
so
on
to
no
one
knows
what
multidimension
white
paused
to
allow
the
other
man
to
grasp
the
importance
of
his
statements
woods
failed
lamentably
to
do
so
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
the
horror
he
asked
have
you
absolutely
no
imagination
shouted
the
old
man
why
i
suppose
i
have
but
i
seem
to
fail
to
understand
we
are
facing
an
invasion
of
creatures
the
old
man
whispered
almost
as
if
fearful
to
speak
the
words
aloud
we
are
being
attacked
by
life
which
is
one
dimension
above
us
in
evolution
we
are
fighting
i
tell
you
a
tribe
of
hellhounds
out
of
the
cosmos
they
are
unthinkably
above
us
in
the
matter
of
intelligence
there
is
a
chasm
of
knowledge
between
us
so
wide
and
so
deep
that
it
staggers
the
imagination
they
regard
us
as
mere
animals
perhaps
not
even
that
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
we
are
just
fodder
something
to
be
eaten
as
we
eat
vegetables
and
cereals
or
the
flesh
of
domesticated
animals
perhaps
they
have
watched
us
for
years
watching
life
on
the
world
increase
lapping
their
monstrous
jowls
over
the
fattening
of
the
earth
they
have
awaited
the
proper
setting
of
the
banquet
table
and
now
they
are
dining
their
thoughts
are
not
our
thoughts
their
ideals
not
our
ideals
perhaps
they
have
nothing
in
common
with
us
except
the
primal
basis
of
all
life
the
necessity
of
feeding
maybe
they
have
come
of
their
own
will
i
prefer
to
believe
that
they
have
perhaps
they
are
merely
following
the
natural
course
of
events
obeying
some
immutable
law
legislated
by
some
higher
being
who
watches
over
the
cosmos
and
dictates
what
shall
be
and
what
shall
not
be
if
this
is
true
it
means
that
there
has
been
a
flaw
in
my
reasoning
for
i
believed
that
the
life
of
each
plane
degenerated
in
company
with
the
degeneration
of
its
plane
of
existence
which
would
obey
the
same
evolutional
laws
which
govern
the
life
upon
it
i
am
quite
satisfied
that
this
invasion
is
a
campaign
that
some
race
has
found
a
means
of
breaking
through
the
veil
of
force
which
separates
its
plane
from
ours
but
pointed
out
henry
woods
you
say
they
are
things
i
ca
see
anything
about
them
to
suggest
an
additional
dimension
they
are
plainly
of
course
they
are
they
would
have
to
be
to
live
in
this
world
of
three
dimensions
the
only
objects
which
we
know
of
in
this
world
are
merely
illusions
projections
of
the
third
dimension
like
a
shadow
it
is
impossible
for
more
than
one
dimension
to
live
on
any
single
plane
to
attack
us
they
would
have
to
lose
one
dimension
this
they
have
evidently
done
you
can
see
how
utterly
ridiculous
it
would
be
for
you
to
try
to
attack
a
thing
so
far
as
you
were
concerned
it
would
have
no
mass
the
same
is
true
of
the
other
dimensions
similarly
a
being
of
a
lesser
plane
could
not
harm
an
inhabitant
of
a
higher
plane
it
is
apparent
that
while
the
horror
has
lost
one
material
dimension
it
has
retained
certain
properties
which
make
it
invulnerable
to
the
forces
at
the
command
of
our
plane
the
newspaperman
was
now
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
but
he
asked
breathlessly
it
all
sounds
so
hopeless
what
can
be
done
about
it
white
hitched
his
chair
closer
and
his
fingers
closed
with
a
fierce
grasp
upon
the
other
knee
a
militant
boom
came
into
his
voice
my
boy
he
said
we
are
to
strike
back
we
are
going
to
invade
the
plane
of
these
hellhounds
we
are
going
to
make
them
feel
our
strength
we
are
going
to
strike
back
henry
woods
sprang
to
his
feet
how
he
shouted
have
you
white
nodded
i
have
found
a
way
to
send
the
into
the
fourth
come
and
i
will
show
you
the
machine
was
huge
but
it
had
an
appearance
of
simple
construction
a
large
rectangular
block
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
strange
black
metal
was
set
on
end
and
flanked
on
each
side
by
two
smaller
ones
on
the
top
of
the
large
block
was
set
a
of
a
strange
substance
somewhat
henry
thought
like
frosted
glass
on
one
side
of
the
large
cube
was
set
a
lever
a
long
glass
panel
two
vertical
tubes
and
three
indicators
the
control
board
it
appeared
was
relatively
simple
beside
the
mass
of
the
five
rectangles
on
the
floor
was
a
large
plate
of
transparent
substance
ground
to
a
concave
surface
through
which
one
could
see
an
intricate
tangle
of
wire
mesh
hanging
from
the
ceiling
directly
above
the
one
on
the
floor
was
another
concave
disk
but
this
one
had
a
far
more
pronounced
curvature
wires
connected
the
two
disks
and
each
in
turn
was
connected
to
the
rectangular
machine
it
is
a
matter
of
the
proper
utilization
of
two
forces
electrical
and
gravitational
proudly
explained
white
those
two
forces
properly
used
warp
the
into
the
fourth
a
reverse
process
is
used
to
return
the
object
to
the
third
the
principle
of
the
machine
is
the
old
man
was
about
to
launch
into
a
lengthy
discussion
but
henry
interrupted
him
a
glance
at
his
watch
had
shown
him
press
time
was
drawing
perilously
close
just
a
second
he
said
you
propose
to
warp
a
being
into
a
fourth
dimension
how
can
a
thing
exist
there
you
said
a
short
time
ago
that
only
a
specified
dimension
could
exist
on
one
single
plane
you
have
missed
my
point
snapped
white
i
am
not
sending
a
thing
to
a
fourth
dimension
i
am
changing
the
being
into
a
being
i
add
a
dimension
and
automatically
the
being
exists
on
a
different
plane
i
am
reversing
evolution
this
third
dimension
we
now
exist
on
evolved
millions
of
eons
ago
from
a
fourth
dimension
i
am
sending
a
lesser
entity
back
over
those
millions
of
eons
to
a
plane
similar
to
one
upon
which
his
ancestors
lived
inconceivably
long
ago
but
man
how
do
you
know
you
can
do
it
the
doctor
eyes
gleamed
and
his
fingers
reached
out
to
press
a
bell
a
servant
appeared
almost
at
once
bring
me
a
dog
snapped
the
old
man
the
servant
disappeared
young
man
said
white
i
am
going
to
show
you
how
i
know
i
can
do
it
i
have
done
it
before
now
i
am
going
to
do
it
for
you
i
have
sent
dogs
and
cats
back
to
the
fourth
dimension
and
returned
them
safely
to
this
room
i
can
do
the
same
with
men
the
servant
reappeared
carrying
in
his
arms
a
small
dog
the
doctor
stepped
to
the
control
board
of
his
strange
machine
all
right
george
he
said
the
servant
had
evidently
worked
with
the
old
man
enough
to
know
what
was
expected
of
him
he
stepped
close
to
the
floor
disk
and
waited
the
dog
whined
softly
sensing
that
all
was
not
exactly
right
the
old
scientist
slowly
shoved
the
lever
toward
the
right
and
as
he
did
so
a
faint
hum
filled
the
room
rising
to
a
stupendous
roar
as
he
advanced
the
lever
from
both
floor
disk
and
upper
disk
leaped
strange
cones
of
blue
light
which
met
midway
to
form
an
shape
of
brilliance
the
light
did
not
waver
or
sparkle
it
did
not
glow
it
seemed
hard
and
brittle
like
straight
bars
of
force
the
newspaperman
gazing
with
awe
upon
it
felt
that
terrific
force
was
there
what
had
the
old
man
said
warp
a
being
into
another
dimension
that
would
take
force
as
he
watched
petrified
by
the
spectacle
the
servant
stepped
forward
and
with
a
flip
tossed
the
little
dog
into
the
blue
light
the
animal
could
be
discerned
for
a
moment
through
the
light
and
then
it
disappeared
look
in
the
globe
shouted
the
old
man
and
henry
jerked
his
eyes
from
the
column
of
light
to
the
atop
the
machine
he
gasped
in
the
globe
deep
within
its
milky
center
glowed
a
picture
that
made
his
brain
reel
as
he
looked
upon
it
it
was
a
scene
such
as
no
man
could
have
imagined
unaided
it
was
a
horribly
distorted
projection
of
an
eccentric
landscape
a
landscape
hardly
analogous
to
anything
on
earth
that
the
fourth
dimension
sir
said
the
servant
that
not
the
fourth
dimension
the
old
man
corrected
him
that
a
impression
of
the
fourth
dimension
it
is
no
more
the
fourth
dimension
than
a
shadow
is
it
like
a
shadow
is
merely
a
projection
it
gives
us
a
glimpse
of
what
the
fourth
plane
is
like
it
is
a
shadow
of
that
plane
slowly
a
dark
blotch
began
to
grow
in
the
landscape
slowly
it
assumed
definite
form
it
puzzled
the
reporter
it
looked
familiar
he
could
have
sworn
he
had
seen
it
somewhere
before
it
was
alive
for
it
had
moved
that
sir
is
the
dog
george
volunteered
that
was
the
dog
white
again
corrected
him
god
knows
what
it
is
now
he
turned
to
the
newspaperman
have
you
seen
enough
he
demanded
henry
nodded
the
other
slowly
began
to
return
the
lever
to
its
original
position
the
roaring
subsided
the
light
faded
the
projection
in
the
grew
fainter
how
are
you
going
to
use
it
asked
the
newspaperman
i
have
men
who
have
agreed
to
be
projected
into
the
fourth
dimension
to
seek
out
the
entities
that
are
attacking
us
and
attack
them
in
turn
i
shall
send
them
out
in
an
hour
where
is
there
a
phone
asked
the
newspaperman
in
the
next
room
replied
white
as
the
reporter
dashed
out
of
the
door
the
light
faded
entirely
from
between
the
two
disks
and
on
the
lower
one
a
little
dog
crouched
quivering
softly
whimpering
the
old
man
stepped
from
the
controls
and
approached
the
disk
he
scooped
the
little
animal
from
where
it
lay
into
his
arms
and
patted
the
silky
head
good
dog
he
murmured
and
the
creature
snuggled
close
to
him
comforted
already
forgetting
that
horrible
place
from
which
it
had
just
returned
is
everything
ready
george
asked
the
old
man
yes
sir
replied
the
servant
the
men
are
all
ready
even
anxious
to
go
if
you
ask
me
sir
they
are
a
tough
lot
they
are
as
brave
a
group
of
men
as
ever
graced
the
earth
replied
the
scientist
gently
they
are
adventurers
every
one
of
whom
has
faced
danger
and
will
not
shrink
from
it
they
are
born
fighters
my
one
regret
is
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
secure
more
like
them
a
thousand
men
such
as
they
should
be
able
to
conquer
any
opponent
it
was
impossible
the
others
were
poor
soft
fools
they
laughed
in
my
face
they
thought
i
was
an
old
fool
i
the
man
who
alone
stands
between
them
and
utter
destruction
his
voice
had
risen
to
almost
a
scream
but
it
again
sank
to
a
normal
tone
i
may
be
sending
brave
men
to
instant
death
i
hope
not
you
can
always
jerk
them
back
sir
suggested
george
maybe
i
can
maybe
not
murmured
the
old
man
henry
woods
appeared
in
the
doorway
when
do
we
start
he
asked
we
exclaimed
the
scientist
certainly
you
do
believe
you
going
to
leave
me
out
of
this
why
man
it
the
greatest
story
of
all
time
i
going
as
special
war
correspondent
they
believed
it
they
are
going
to
publish
it
cried
the
old
man
clutching
at
the
newspaperman
sleeve
well
the
editor
was
skeptical
at
first
but
after
i
swore
on
all
sorts
of
oaths
it
was
true
he
ate
it
up
maybe
you
think
that
story
stop
the
presses
i
did
expect
them
to
i
just
took
a
chance
i
thought
they
too
would
laugh
at
me
but
when
do
we
start
persisted
henry
you
are
really
in
earnest
you
really
want
to
go
asked
the
old
man
unbelievingly
i
am
going
try
to
stop
me
white
glanced
at
his
watch
we
will
start
in
exactly
minutes
he
said
ten
seconds
to
go
george
standing
with
watch
in
hand
spoke
in
a
precise
manner
the
very
crispness
of
his
words
betraying
the
excitement
under
which
he
labored
the
blue
light
hissing
drove
from
disk
to
disk
the
room
thundered
with
the
roar
of
the
machine
before
which
stood
white
his
hand
on
the
lever
his
eyes
glued
on
the
instruments
before
him
in
a
line
stood
the
men
who
were
to
fling
themselves
into
the
light
to
be
warped
into
another
dimension
there
to
seek
out
and
fight
an
unknown
enemy
the
line
was
headed
by
a
tall
man
with
hands
like
hams
with
a
face
and
a
wild
mop
of
hair
behind
him
stood
a
belligerent
little
cockney
henry
woods
stood
fifth
in
line
they
were
a
motley
lot
adventurers
every
one
of
them
and
some
were
obviously
afraid
as
they
stood
before
that
column
of
light
with
only
a
few
seconds
of
the
third
dimension
left
to
them
they
had
answered
a
weird
advertisement
and
had
but
a
limited
idea
of
what
they
were
about
to
do
grimly
though
they
accepted
it
as
a
job
a
bizarre
job
but
a
job
they
faced
it
as
they
had
faced
other
equally
dangerous
but
less
unusual
jobs
five
seconds
snapped
george
the
lever
was
all
the
way
over
now
the
showed
within
its
milky
interior
a
hideously
distorted
landscape
the
light
had
taken
on
a
hard
brittle
appearance
and
its
hiss
had
risen
to
a
scream
the
machine
thundered
steadily
with
a
suggestion
of
horrible
power
time
up
the
tall
man
stepped
forward
his
foot
reached
the
disk
another
step
and
he
was
bathed
in
the
light
a
third
and
he
glimmered
momentarily
then
vanished
close
on
his
heels
followed
the
little
cockney
with
his
nerves
at
almost
a
snapping
point
henry
moved
on
behind
the
fourth
man
he
was
horribly
afraid
he
wanted
to
break
from
the
line
and
run
it
did
matter
where
any
place
to
get
away
from
that
steady
steely
light
in
front
of
him
he
had
seen
three
men
step
into
it
glow
for
a
second
and
then
disappear
a
fourth
man
had
placed
his
foot
on
the
disk
cold
sweat
stood
out
on
his
brow
like
an
automaton
he
placed
one
foot
on
the
disk
the
fourth
man
had
already
disappeared
snap
into
it
pal
growled
the
man
behind
henry
lifted
the
other
foot
caught
his
toe
on
the
edge
of
the
disk
and
stumbled
headlong
into
the
column
of
light
he
was
conscious
of
intense
heat
which
was
instantly
followed
by
equally
intense
cold
for
a
moment
his
body
seemed
to
be
under
enormous
pressure
then
it
seemed
to
be
expanding
flying
apart
bursting
exploding
he
felt
solid
ground
under
his
feet
and
his
eyes
snapping
open
saw
an
alien
land
it
was
a
land
of
somber
color
with
great
gray
moors
and
beetling
black
cliffs
there
was
something
queer
about
it
an
intangible
quality
that
baffled
him
he
looked
about
him
expecting
to
see
his
companions
he
saw
no
one
he
was
absolutely
alone
in
that
desolate
brooding
land
something
dreadful
had
happened
was
he
the
only
one
to
be
safely
transported
from
the
third
dimension
had
some
horrible
accident
occurred
was
he
alone
sudden
panic
seized
him
if
something
had
happened
if
the
others
were
not
here
might
it
not
be
possible
that
the
machine
would
not
be
able
to
bring
him
back
to
his
own
dimension
was
he
doomed
to
remain
marooned
forever
in
this
terrible
plane
he
looked
down
at
his
body
and
gasped
in
dismay
it
was
not
his
body
it
was
a
grotesque
caricature
of
a
body
a
horrible
profane
mass
of
flesh
like
a
phantasmagoric
beast
snatched
from
the
dreams
of
a
lunatic
it
was
real
however
he
felt
it
with
his
hands
but
they
were
not
hands
they
were
something
like
hands
they
served
the
same
purpose
that
hands
served
in
the
third
dimension
he
was
he
realized
a
being
of
the
fourth
dimension
but
in
his
brain
still
clung
remnants
of
that
faithful
old
brain
he
could
not
as
yet
see
with
eyes
think
purely
thoughts
he
had
not
oriented
himself
as
yet
to
this
new
plane
of
existence
he
was
seeing
the
fourth
dimension
through
the
blurred
lenses
of
millions
of
eons
of
existence
he
was
seeing
it
much
more
clearly
than
he
had
seen
it
in
the
atop
the
machine
in
white
laboratory
but
he
would
not
see
it
clearly
until
every
vestige
of
the
third
dimension
was
wiped
from
him
that
he
knew
would
come
in
time
he
felt
his
weird
body
with
those
things
that
served
as
hands
and
he
found
beneath
his
groping
unearthly
fingers
great
rolling
muscles
powerful
tendons
and
hard
flesh
a
sense
of
surged
through
him
and
he
growled
like
an
animal
like
an
animal
of
that
horrible
fourth
plane
but
the
terrible
sounds
that
came
from
between
his
slobbering
lips
were
not
those
of
his
own
voice
they
were
the
voices
of
many
men
then
he
knew
he
was
not
alone
here
in
this
one
body
were
the
bodies
the
brains
the
power
the
spirit
of
those
other
men
in
the
fourth
dimension
all
the
millions
of
things
were
one
perhaps
that
particular
portion
of
the
third
dimension
called
the
earth
had
sprung
from
or
degenerated
from
one
single
unit
of
a
dissolving
fourth
dimension
the
third
dimension
warped
back
to
a
higher
plane
was
automatically
obeying
the
mystic
laws
of
evolution
by
reforming
in
the
shape
of
that
old
ancestor
unimaginably
removed
in
time
from
the
race
he
had
begot
he
was
no
longer
henry
woods
newspaperman
he
was
an
entity
that
had
given
birth
in
the
dim
ages
when
the
earth
was
born
to
a
third
dimension
nor
was
he
alone
this
body
of
his
was
composed
of
other
sons
of
that
ancient
entity
he
felt
himself
grow
felt
his
body
grow
vaster
assume
greater
proportions
felt
new
vitality
flow
through
him
it
was
the
other
men
the
men
who
were
flinging
themselves
into
the
column
of
light
in
the
laboratory
to
be
warped
back
to
this
plane
to
be
incorporated
in
his
body
it
was
not
his
body
however
his
brain
was
not
his
alone
the
pronoun
he
realized
represented
the
sum
total
of
those
other
men
his
fellow
adventurers
suddenly
a
new
feeling
came
a
feeling
of
completeness
a
feeling
of
supreme
fitness
he
knew
that
the
last
of
the
men
had
stepped
across
the
disk
that
all
were
here
in
this
giant
body
now
he
could
see
more
clearly
things
in
the
landscape
which
had
escaped
him
before
became
recognizable
awful
thoughts
ran
through
his
brain
heavy
ponderous
black
thoughts
he
began
to
recognize
the
landscape
as
something
familiar
something
he
had
seen
before
a
thing
with
which
he
was
intimate
phenomena
which
his
intelligence
would
have
gasped
at
became
commonplace
he
was
finally
seeing
through
eyes
thinking
thoughts
memory
seeped
into
his
brain
and
he
had
fleeting
visions
visions
of
dark
caverns
lit
by
hellish
flames
of
huge
seas
that
battered
remorselessly
with
waves
against
towering
headlands
that
reared
titanic
toward
a
glowering
sky
he
remembered
a
red
desert
scattered
with
scarlet
boulders
he
remembered
silver
cliffs
of
gleaming
metallic
stone
through
all
his
thoughts
ran
something
else
a
scarlet
thread
of
hate
an
passion
a
fierce
lust
after
the
life
of
some
other
entity
he
was
no
longer
a
composite
thing
built
of
beings
he
was
a
creature
of
another
plane
a
creature
with
a
consuming
hate
and
suddenly
he
knew
against
whom
this
hate
was
directed
and
why
he
knew
also
that
this
creature
was
near
and
his
great
fists
closed
and
then
spread
wide
as
he
knew
it
how
did
he
know
it
perhaps
through
some
sense
which
he
as
a
being
of
another
plane
held
but
which
was
alien
to
the
earth
later
he
asked
himself
this
question
at
the
time
however
there
was
no
questioning
on
his
part
he
only
knew
that
somewhere
near
was
a
hated
enemy
and
he
did
not
question
the
source
of
his
knowledge
mumbling
in
an
idiom
incomprehensible
to
a
being
filled
with
rage
that
wove
redly
through
his
brain
he
lumbered
down
the
hill
onto
the
moor
his
great
strides
eating
up
the
distance
his
footsteps
shaking
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
halted
and
from
his
throat
issued
a
challenging
roar
that
made
the
very
crags
surrounding
the
moor
tremble
the
rocks
flung
back
the
roar
as
if
in
mockery
again
he
shouted
and
in
the
shout
he
framed
a
lurid
insult
to
the
enemy
that
lurked
there
in
the
cliffs
again
the
crags
flung
back
the
insult
but
this
time
the
echoes
booming
over
the
moor
were
drowned
by
another
voice
the
voice
of
the
enemy
at
the
far
end
of
the
moor
appeared
a
gigantic
form
a
form
that
shambled
on
grotesque
misshapen
feet
growling
angrily
as
he
came
he
came
rapidly
despite
his
clumsy
gait
and
as
he
came
he
mouthed
terrific
threats
close
to
the
other
he
halted
and
only
then
did
recognition
dawn
in
his
eyes
mal
shaff
he
growled
in
his
guttural
tongue
and
surprise
and
consternation
were
written
large
upon
his
ugly
face
yes
it
is
i
mal
shaff
boomed
the
other
remember
ouglat
the
day
you
destroyed
me
and
my
plane
i
have
returned
to
wreak
my
vengeance
i
have
solved
a
mystery
you
have
never
guessed
and
i
have
come
back
you
did
not
imagine
you
were
attacking
me
again
when
you
sent
your
minions
to
that
other
plane
to
feed
upon
the
beings
there
it
was
i
you
were
attacking
fool
and
i
am
here
to
kill
you
ouglat
leaped
and
the
thing
that
had
been
henry
woods
newspaperman
and
other
men
but
was
now
mal
shaff
of
the
fourth
dimension
leaped
to
meet
him
mal
shaff
felt
the
force
of
ouglat
felt
the
sharp
pain
of
a
hammering
fist
and
lashed
out
with
those
horrible
arms
of
his
to
smash
at
the
leering
face
of
his
antagonist
he
felt
his
fists
strike
solid
flesh
felt
the
bones
creak
and
tremble
beneath
his
blow
his
nostrils
were
filled
with
the
terrible
stench
of
the
other
foul
breath
and
his
filthy
body
he
teetered
on
his
gnarled
legs
and
a
vicious
kick
and
then
stepped
in
to
gouge
with
straightened
thumb
at
the
other
eye
the
thumb
went
true
and
ouglat
howled
in
pain
mal
shaff
leaped
back
as
his
opponent
charged
head
down
and
his
knotted
fist
beat
a
thunderous
tattoo
as
the
misshapen
beast
closed
in
he
felt
clawing
fingers
seeking
his
throat
felt
ghastly
nails
ripping
at
his
shoulders
in
desperation
he
struck
blindly
and
ouglat
reeled
away
with
a
quick
stride
he
shortened
the
distance
between
them
and
struck
ouglat
a
hard
blow
squarely
on
his
slavering
mouth
pressing
hard
upon
the
reeling
figure
he
swung
his
fists
like
and
ouglat
stumbled
falling
in
a
heap
on
the
sand
mal
shaff
leaped
upon
the
fallen
foe
and
kicked
him
with
his
taloned
feet
ripping
him
wickedly
there
was
no
thought
of
fair
play
no
faintest
glimmer
of
mercy
this
was
a
battle
to
the
death
there
could
be
no
quarter
the
fallen
monster
howled
but
his
voice
cut
short
as
his
foul
mouth
with
its
fangs
closed
on
the
other
body
his
talons
seeking
a
hold
clawed
deep
mal
shaff
his
brain
a
screaming
maelstrom
of
weird
emotions
aimed
blows
at
the
enemy
clawed
and
ripped
together
the
two
rolled
locked
tight
in
titanic
battle
on
the
sandy
plain
and
a
great
cloud
of
heavy
dust
marked
where
they
struggled
in
desperation
ouglat
put
every
ounce
of
his
strength
into
a
heave
that
broke
the
other
grip
and
flung
him
away
the
two
monstrosities
surged
to
their
feet
their
eyes
red
with
hate
glaring
through
the
dust
cloud
at
one
another
slowly
ouglat
hand
stole
to
a
black
wicked
cylinder
that
hung
on
a
belt
at
his
waist
his
fingers
closed
upon
it
and
he
drew
the
weapon
as
he
leveled
it
at
mal
shaff
his
lips
curled
back
and
his
features
distorted
into
something
that
was
not
pleasant
to
see
mal
shaff
with
doubled
fists
saw
the
great
thumb
of
his
enemy
slowly
depressing
a
button
on
the
cylinder
and
a
great
fear
held
him
rooted
in
his
tracks
in
the
back
of
his
brain
something
was
vainly
trying
to
explain
to
him
the
horror
of
this
thing
which
the
other
held
then
a
multicolored
spiral
like
a
corkscrew
column
of
vapor
sprang
from
the
cylinder
and
flashed
toward
him
it
struck
him
full
on
the
chest
and
even
as
it
did
so
he
caught
the
ugly
fire
of
triumph
in
the
red
eyes
of
his
enemy
he
felt
a
stinging
sensation
where
the
spiral
struck
but
that
was
all
he
was
astounded
he
had
feared
this
weapon
had
been
sure
it
portended
some
form
of
horrible
death
but
all
it
did
was
to
produce
a
slight
sting
for
a
split
second
he
stood
then
he
surged
forward
and
advanced
upon
ouglat
his
hands
outspread
like
claws
from
his
throat
came
those
horrible
sounds
the
speech
of
the
fourth
dimension
did
i
not
tell
you
foul
son
of
sargouthe
that
i
had
solved
a
mystery
you
have
never
guessed
at
although
you
destroyed
me
long
ago
i
have
returned
throw
away
your
puny
weapon
i
am
of
the
lower
dimension
and
am
invulnerable
to
your
engines
of
destruction
you
bloated
his
words
trailed
off
into
a
stream
of
vileness
that
could
never
have
occurred
to
a
mind
ouglat
with
every
line
of
his
face
distorted
with
fear
flung
the
weapon
from
him
and
turning
fled
clumsily
down
the
moor
with
mal
shaff
at
his
heels
steadily
mal
shaff
gained
and
with
only
a
few
feet
separating
him
from
ouglat
he
dived
with
outspread
arms
at
the
other
legs
the
two
came
down
together
but
mal
shaff
grip
was
broken
by
the
fall
and
the
two
regained
their
feet
at
almost
the
same
instant
the
wild
moor
resounded
to
their
throaty
roaring
and
the
high
cliffs
flung
back
the
echoes
of
the
bellowing
of
the
two
gladiators
below
it
was
sheer
strength
now
and
flesh
and
bone
were
bruised
and
broken
under
the
blows
that
they
dealt
great
furrows
were
plowed
in
the
sand
by
the
sliding
of
heavy
feet
as
the
two
fighters
shifted
to
or
away
from
attack
blood
blood
of
creatures
covered
the
bodies
of
the
two
and
stained
the
sand
with
its
horrible
hue
perspiration
streamed
from
them
and
their
breath
came
in
gulping
gasps
the
lurid
sun
slid
across
the
purple
sky
and
still
the
two
fought
on
ouglat
one
of
the
ancients
and
mal
shaff
reincarnated
it
was
a
battle
of
giants
a
battle
that
must
have
beggared
even
the
titanic
tilting
of
forgotten
gods
and
entities
in
the
ages
when
the
earth
was
young
mal
shaff
had
no
conception
of
time
he
may
have
fought
seconds
or
hours
it
seemed
an
eternity
he
had
attempted
to
fight
scientifically
but
had
failed
to
do
so
while
one
part
of
him
had
cried
out
to
elude
his
opponent
to
wait
for
openings
to
conserve
his
strength
another
part
had
shouted
at
him
to
step
in
and
smash
smash
smash
at
the
hated
monstrosity
pitted
against
him
it
seemed
ouglat
was
growing
in
size
had
become
more
agile
that
his
strength
was
greater
his
punches
hurt
more
it
was
harder
to
hit
him
still
mal
shaff
drilled
in
determinedly
head
down
fists
working
like
pistons
as
the
other
seemed
to
grow
stronger
and
larger
he
seemed
to
become
smaller
and
weaker
it
was
queer
ouglat
should
be
tired
too
his
punches
should
be
weaker
he
should
move
more
slowly
be
heavier
on
his
feet
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
ouglat
was
growing
larger
was
drawing
on
some
mysterious
reserve
of
strength
from
somewhere
new
force
and
life
were
flowing
into
his
body
but
from
where
was
this
strength
coming
a
huge
fist
smashed
against
mal
shaff
jaw
he
felt
himself
lifted
and
the
next
moment
he
skidded
across
the
sand
lying
there
gasping
for
breath
almost
too
fagged
to
rise
with
the
black
bulk
of
the
enemy
looming
through
the
dust
cloud
before
him
he
suddenly
realized
the
source
of
the
other
renewed
strength
ouglat
was
recalling
his
minions
from
the
third
dimension
they
were
incorporating
in
his
body
returning
to
their
parent
body
they
were
coming
back
from
the
third
dimension
to
the
fourth
dimension
to
fight
a
thing
reincarnated
in
the
form
it
had
lost
millions
of
eons
ago
this
was
the
end
thought
mal
shaff
but
he
staggered
to
his
feet
to
meet
the
charge
of
the
ancient
enemy
and
a
grim
song
a
death
chant
immeasurably
old
suddenly
and
dimly
remembered
from
out
of
the
mists
of
countless
millenniums
was
on
his
lips
as
he
swung
a
blow
into
the
suddenly
astonished
face
of
the
rushing
ouglat
the
milky
globe
atop
the
machine
in
white
laboratory
glowed
softly
and
within
that
glow
two
figures
seemed
to
struggle
before
the
machine
his
hands
still
on
the
controls
stood
silas
white
behind
him
the
room
was
crowded
with
newspapermen
and
photographers
hours
had
passed
since
the
men
counting
henry
woods
had
stepped
into
the
brittle
column
of
light
to
be
shunted
back
through
unguessed
time
to
a
different
plane
of
existence
the
old
scientist
during
all
those
hours
had
stood
like
a
graven
image
before
his
machine
eyes
staring
fixedly
at
the
globe
through
the
open
windows
he
had
heard
the
cry
of
the
newsboy
as
the
put
the
greatest
scoop
of
all
time
on
the
street
the
phone
had
rung
like
mad
and
george
answered
it
the
doorbell
buzzed
repeatedly
and
george
ushered
in
newspapermen
who
had
asked
innumerable
questions
to
which
he
had
replied
briefly
almost
mechanically
the
reporters
had
fought
for
the
use
of
the
one
phone
in
the
house
and
had
finally
drawn
lots
for
it
a
few
had
raced
out
to
use
other
phones
photographers
came
and
flashes
popped
and
cameras
clicked
the
room
was
in
an
uproar
on
the
rare
occasions
when
the
reporters
were
not
using
the
phone
the
instrument
buzzed
shrilly
authoritative
voices
demanded
silas
white
george
his
eyes
on
the
old
man
stated
that
silas
white
could
not
be
disturbed
that
he
was
busy
from
the
street
below
came
the
hum
of
thousands
of
voices
the
street
was
packed
with
a
jostling
crowd
of
awed
humanity
every
eye
fastened
on
the
house
of
silas
white
lines
of
police
held
them
back
what
makes
them
move
so
slowly
asked
a
reporter
staring
at
the
globe
they
hardly
seem
to
be
moving
it
looks
like
a
slow
motion
picture
they
are
not
moving
slowly
replied
white
there
must
be
a
difference
in
time
in
the
fourth
dimension
maybe
what
is
hours
to
us
is
only
seconds
to
them
time
must
flow
more
slowly
there
perhaps
it
is
a
bigger
place
than
this
third
plane
that
may
account
for
it
they
moving
slowly
they
are
fighting
savagely
it
a
fight
to
the
death
watch
the
grotesque
arm
of
one
of
the
figures
in
the
milky
globe
was
moving
out
slowly
loafing
along
aimed
at
the
head
of
the
other
slowly
the
other
twisted
his
body
aside
but
too
slowly
the
fist
finally
touched
the
head
still
moving
slowly
forward
the
body
following
as
slowly
the
head
of
the
creature
twisted
bent
backward
and
the
body
toppled
back
in
a
leisurely
manner
what
does
white
say
ca
you
get
a
statement
of
some
sort
from
him
wo
he

all
a
hell

editor
slammed
the

on
the
hook

snapped

typewriters
gibbered
like
chuckling
morons
through
the
roaring
tumult
of
the
editorial
rooms
copy
boys
rushed
about
white
sheets
clutched
in
their
grimy
hands
telephones
jangled
and
strident
voices
blared
through
the
haze
that
arose
from
the
pipes
and
cigarettes
of
perspiring
writers
who
feverishly
transferred
to
paper
the
startling
events
that
were
rocking
the
world
the
editor
his
necktie
off
his
shirt
open
his
sleeves
rolled
to
the
elbow
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
desk
it
had
been
a
hectic
hours
and
he
had
stayed
at
the
desk
every
minute
of
the
time
he
was
dead
tired
when
the
moment
of
relaxation
came
when
the
tension
snapped
he
knew
he
would
fall
into
an
exhausted
stupor
of
sleep
but
the
excitement
was
keeping
him
on
his
feet
there
was
work
to
do
there
was
news
such
as
the
world
had
never
known
before
each
new
story
meant
a
new
front
another
extra
even
now
the
presses
were
thundering
even
now
papers
with
the
ink
hardly
dry
upon
them
were
being
snatched
by
the
avid
public
from
the
hands
of
screaming
newsboys
a
man
raced
toward
the
city
desk
waving
a
sheet
of
paper
in
his
hand
sensing
something
unusual
the
others
in
the
room
crowded
about
as
he
laid
the
sheet
before
the
editor
just
came
in
the
man
gasped
the
paper
was
a
wire
dispatch
it
read
rome
the
black
horror
is
in
full
retreat
although
still
apparently
immune
to
the
weapons
being
used
against
it
it
is
lifting
the
siege
of
this
city
the
cause
is
unknown
the
editor
ran
his
eye
down
the
sheet
there
was
another
dateline
madrid
the
black
horror
which
has
enclosed
this
city
in
a
ring
of
dark
terror
for
the
last
two
days
is
fleeing
rapidly
disappearing
the
editor
pressed
a
button
there
was
an
answering
buzz
composing

he
shouted
get
ready
for
a
new
front
yes
another
extra
this
will
knock
their
eyes
out
a
telephone

furiously
the
editor
seized

operator
he
said
get
me
the
secretary
of
war
at
washington
the
secretary
in
person
you
understand
no
one
else
will
do
he
turned
again
to
the
reporters
who
stood
about
the
desk
in
two
hours
he
explained
banging
the
desk
top
for
emphasis
have
the
united
states
army
marching
into
that
light
woods
walked
into
the
bloody
sun
was
touching
the
edge
of
the
weird
world
seeming
to
hesitate
before
taking
the
final
plunge
behind
the
towering
black
crags
that
hung
above
the
shadows
at
their
base
the
purple
sky
had
darkened
until
it
was
almost
the
color
of
soft
black
velvet
great
stars
were
blazing
out
ouglat
loomed
large
in
the
gathering
twilight
a
horrible
misshapen
ogre
of
an
outer
world
he
had
grown
taller
broader
greater
mal
head
now
was
on
a
level
with
the
other
chest
his
huge
arms
seemed
toylike
in
comparison
with
those
of
ouglat
his
legs
mere
pipestems
time
and
time
again
he
had
barely
escaped
as
the
clutching
hands
of
ouglat
reached
out
to
grasp
him
once
within
those
hands
he
would
be
torn
apart
the
battle
had
become
a
game
of
hide
and
seek
a
game
of
cat
and
mouse
with
mal
shaff
the
mouse
slowly
the
sun
sank
and
the
world
became
darker
his
brain
working
feverishly
mal
shaff
waited
for
the
darkness
adroitly
he
worked
the
battle
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
stygian
darkness
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
mighty
crags
in
the
darkness
he
might
escape
he
could
no
longer
continue
this
unequal
fight
only
escape
was
left
the
sun
was
gone
now
blackness
was
dropping
swiftly
over
the
land
like
a
great
blanket
creating
the
illusion
of
the
glowering
sky
descending
to
the
ground
only
a
few
feet
away
lay
the
total
blackness
under
the
cliffs
like
a
flash
mal
shaff
darted
into
the
blackness
was
completely
swallowed
in
it
roaring
ouglat
followed
his
shoulders
almost
touching
the
great
rock
wall
that
shot
straight
up
hundreds
of
feet
above
him
mal
shaff
ran
swiftly
fear
lending
speed
to
his
shivering
legs
behind
him
he
heard
the
bellowing
of
his
enemy
ouglat
was
searching
for
him
a
hopeless
search
in
that
total
darkness
he
would
never
find
him
mal
shaff
felt
sure
fagged
and
out
of
breath
he
dropped
panting
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
blood
pounded
through
his
head
and
his
strength
seemed
to
be
gone
he
lay
still
and
stared
out
into
the
less
dark
moor
that
stretched
before
him
for
some
time
he
lay
there
resting
aimlessly
he
looked
out
over
the
moor
and
then
he
suddenly
noted
some
distance
to
his
right
a
hill
rising
from
the
moor
the
hill
was
vaguely
familiar
he
remembered
it
dimly
as
being
of
great
importance
a
sudden
inexplicable
restlessness
filled
him
far
behind
him
he
heard
the
enraged
bellowing
of
ouglat
but
that
he
scarcely
noticed
so
long
as
darkness
lay
upon
the
land
he
knew
he
was
safe
from
his
enemy
the
hill
had
made
him
restless
he
must
reach
the
top
he
could
think
of
no
logical
reason
for
doing
so
obviously
he
was
safer
here
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
but
a
voice
seemed
to
be
calling
a
friendly
voice
from
the
hilltop
he
rose
on
aching
legs
and
forged
ahead
every
fiber
of
his
being
cried
out
in
protest
but
resolutely
he
placed
one
foot
ahead
of
the
other
walking
mechanically
opposite
the
hill
he
disregarded
the
strange
call
that
pulsed
down
upon
him
long
enough
to
rest
his
tortured
body
he
must
build
up
his
strength
for
the
climb
he
realized
that
danger
lay
ahead
once
he
quitted
the
blackness
of
the
cliff
base
ouglat
even
in
the
darkness
that
lay
over
the
land
might
see
him
that
would
be
disastrous
once
over
the
top
of
the
hill
he
would
be
safe
suddenly
the
landscape
was
bathed
in
light
a
soft
green
radiance
one
moment
it
had
been
pitch
dark
the
next
it
was
light
as
if
a
giant
had
been
snapped
on
in
terror
mal
shaff
looked
for
the
source
of
the
light
just
above
the
horizon
hung
a
great
green
orb
which
moved
up
the
ladder
of
the
sky
even
as
he
watched
a
moon
a
huge
green
satellite
hurtling
swiftly
around
this
cursed
world
a
great
overwhelming
fear
sat
upon
mal
shaff
and
with
a
high
shrill
scream
of
anger
he
raced
forward
forgetful
of
aching
body
and
outraged
lungs
his
scream
was
answered
from
far
off
and
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
cliffs
toward
the
far
end
of
the
moor
a
black
figure
hurled
itself
ouglat
was
on
the
trail
mal
shaff
tore
madly
up
the
slope
topped
the
crest
and
threw
himself
flat
on
the
ground
almost
exhausted
a
queer
feeling
stole
over
him
a
queer
feeling
of
new
strength
was
flowing
into
him
the
old
thrill
of
battle
was
pounding
through
his
blood
once
more
not
only
were
queer
things
happening
to
his
body
but
also
to
his
brain
the
world
about
him
looked
queer
held
a
sort
of
an
intangible
mystery
he
could
not
understand
a
half
question
formed
in
the
back
of
his
brain
who
and
what
was
he
queer
thoughts
to
be
thinking
he
was
mal
shaff
but
had
he
always
been
mal
shaff
he
remembered
a
brittle
column
of
light
creatures
with
bodies
unlike
his
body
walking
into
it
he
had
been
one
of
those
creatures
there
was
something
about
dimensions
about
different
planes
a
plan
for
one
plane
to
attack
another
he
scrambled
to
his
bowed
legs
and
beat
his
great
chest
with
mighty
hands
he
flung
back
his
head
and
from
his
throat
broke
a
sound
to
curdle
the
blood
of
even
the
bravest
on
the
moor
below
ouglat
heard
the
cry
and
answered
it
with
one
equally
ferocious
mal
shaff
took
a
step
forward
then
stopped
through
his
brain
went
a
sharp
command
to
return
to
the
spot
where
he
had
stood
to
wait
there
until
attacked
he
stepped
back
shifting
his
feet
impatiently
he
was
growing
larger
every
second
fresh
vitality
was
pouring
into
him
before
his
eyes
danced
a
red
curtain
of
hate
and
his
tongue
roared
forth
a
series
of
insulting
challenges
to
the
figure
that
was
even
now
approaching
the
foot
of
the
hill
as
ouglat
climbed
the
hill
the
night
became
an
insane
bedlam
the
challenging
roars
beat
like
surf
against
the
black
cliffs
ouglat
lips
were
flecked
with
foam
his
red
eyes
were
mere
slits
his
mouth
worked
convulsively
they
were
only
a
few
feet
apart
when
ouglat
charged
mal
shaff
was
ready
for
him
there
was
no
longer
any
difference
in
their
size
and
they
met
like
the
two
forward
walls
of
contending
football
teams
mal
shaff
felt
the
soft
throat
of
the
other
under
his
fingers
and
his
grip
tightened
maddened
ouglat
shot
terrific
blow
after
terrific
blow
into
mal
shaff
body
try
as
he
might
however
he
could
not
shake
the
other
grip
it
was
silent
now
the
night
seemed
brooding
watching
the
struggle
on
the
hilltop
larger
and
larger
grew
mal
shaff
until
he
overtopped
ouglat
like
a
giant
then
he
loosened
his
grip
and
as
ouglat
tried
to
scuttle
away
reached
down
to
grasp
him
by
the
nape
of
his
neck
high
above
his
head
he
lifted
his
enemy
and
dashed
him
to
the
ground
with
a
leap
he
was
on
the
prostrate
figure
trampling
it
apart
smashing
it
into
the
ground
with
wild
cries
he
stamped
the
earth
treading
out
the
last
of
ouglat
the
black
horror
when
no
trace
of
the
thing
that
had
been
ouglat
remained
he
moved
away
and
viewed
the
trampled
ground
then
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
that
the
crest
of
the
hill
was
crowded
with
other
monstrous
figures
he
glared
at
them
half
in
surprise
half
in
anger
he
had
not
noticed
their
silent
approach
it
is
mal
shaff
cried
one
yes
i
am
mal
shaff
what
do
you
want
but
mal
shaff
ouglat
destroyed
you
once
long
ago
and
i
just
now
replied
mal
shaff
have
destroyed
ouglat
the
figures
were
silent
shifting
uneasily
then
one
stepped
forward
mal
shaff
it
said
we
thought
you
were
dead
apparently
it
was
not
so
we
welcome
you
to
our
land
again
ouglat
who
once
tried
to
kill
you
and
apparently
failed
you
have
killed
which
is
right
and
proper
come
and
live
with
us
again
in
peace
we
welcome
you
mal
shaff
bowed
gone
was
all
thought
of
the
third
dimension
through
mal
shaff
mind
raced
strange
haunting
memories
of
a
red
desert
scattered
with
scarlet
boulders
of
silver
cliffs
of
gleaming
metallic
stone
of
huge
seas
battering
against
towering
headlands
there
were
other
things
too
great
palaces
of
shining
jewels
and
weird
nights
of
inhuman
joy
where
hellish
flames
lit
deep
black
caverns
he
bowed
again
i
thank
you
bathazar
he
said
without
a
backward
look
he
shambled
down
the
hill
with
the
others
yes
said
the
editor
what
that
you
say
doctor

dead
a
suicide

of

horror
