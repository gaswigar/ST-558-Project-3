prefatory
note
we
do
not
intend
to
review
our
own
work
if
we
did
it
justice
we
might
be
accused
of
partiality
and
we
are
not
such
fools
as
to
abuse
it
we
leave
that
to
our
literary
friends
who
may
have
so
little
taste
as
not
to
appreciate
its
merits
not
that
there
would
be
anything
novel
in
reviewing
our
own
performances
that
we
have
discovered
since
we
have
assumed
the
office
of
editor
but
still
it
is
always
done
whereas
in
our
position
we
could
not
deny
our
situation
as
editor
and
author
of
therefore
we
say
nothing
but
we
take
this
opportunity
of
saying
a
few
words
to
the
public
naval
was
our
first
attempt
and
its
having
been
our
first
attempt
must
be
offered
in
extenuation
of
its
many
imperfections
it
was
written
hastily
and
before
it
was
complete
we
were
appointed
to
a
ship
we
cared
much
about
our
ship
and
little
about
our
book
the
first
was
diligently
taken
care
of
by
ourselves
the
second
was
left
in
the
hands
of
others
to
get
on
how
it
could
like
most
bantlings
put
out
to
nurse
it
did
not
get
on
very
well
as
we
happen
to
be
in
a
communicative
vein
it
may
be
as
well
to
remark
that
being
written
in
the
autobiographical
style
it
was
asserted
by
friends
and
believed
in
general
that
it
was
a
history
of
the
author
life
now
without
pretending
to
have
been
better
than
we
should
have
been
in
our
earlier
days
we
do
most
solemnly
assure
the
public
that
had
we
run
the
career
of
vice
of
the
hero
of
the
at
all
events
we
should
have
had
sufficient
sense
of
shame
not
to
have
avowed
it
except
the
hero
and
heroine
and
those
parts
of
the
work
which
supply
the
slight
plot
of
it
as
a
novel
the
work
in
itself
is
materially
true
especially
in
the
narrative
of
sea
adventure
most
of
which
did
to
the
best
of
our
recollection
occur
to
the
author
we
say
to
the
best
of
our
recollection
as
it
behoves
us
to
be
careful
we
have
not
forgotten
the
snare
in
which
chamier
found
himself
by
asserting
in
his
preface
that
his
narrative
was
fact
in
naval
much
good
material
was
thrown
away
but
we
intend
to
write
it
over
again
some
day
of
these
days
and
naval
when
corrected
will
be
so
improved
that
he
may
be
permitted
to
stand
on
the
same
shelf
with
and
and
and
a
footnote
a
the
improvement
was
never
ed
the
confounded
licking
we
received
for
our
first
attempts
in
the
critical
notices
is
probably
well
known
to
the
reader
at
all
events
we
have
not
forgotten
it
now
with
some
this
severe
castigation
of
their
first
offence
would
have
had
the
effect
of
their
never
offending
again
but
we
felt
that
our
punishment
was
rather
too
severe
it
produced
indignation
instead
of
contrition
and
we
determined
to
write
again
in
spite
of
all
the
critics
in
the
universe
and
in
the
due
course
of
nine
months
we
produced
king
in
naval
we
had
sowed
all
our
wild
oats
we
had
those
who
had
us
and
we
had
no
further
personality
to
indulge
in
king
therefore
was
wholly
fictitious
in
characters
in
plot
and
in
events
as
have
been
its
successors
king
was
followed
by
forster
newton
by
these
are
our
productions
reader
we
have
told
our
tale
this
significant
document
was
published
by
captain
marryat
in
the
of
which
he
was
at
that
time
the
editor
on
the
first
appearance
of
in
order
among
other
things
to
disclaim
the
authorship
of
a
work
entitled
the
which
contained
an
infamous
libel
upon
one
of
our
most
distinguished
officers
deceased
and
upon
the
service
in
general
it
repudiates
without
explaining
away
certain
unpleasant
impressions
that
even
the
careful
reader
of
can
not
entirely
avoid
marryat
made
frank
mildmay
a
scamp
i
am
afraid
in
order
to
prove
that
he
himself
had
not
stood
for
the
portrait
but
he
clearly
did
not
recognise
the
full
enormities
of
his
hero
to
which
he
was
partially
blinded
by
a
certain
share
thereof
the
adventures
were
admittedly
his
own
they
were
easily
recognised
and
he
had
no
right
to
complain
of
being
confounded
with
the
insolent
young
devil
to
whom
they
were
attributed
it
would
however
be
at
once
ungracious
and
unprofitable
to
attempt
any
analysis
of
the
points
of
difference
and
resemblance
any
reader
will
detect
the
author
failings
by
his
work
other
coincidences
may
be
noticed
here
it
has
been
said
in
the
general
introduction
that
marryat
cruises
in
the
are
almost
literally
described
in
we
have
also
independent
accounts
of
certain
personal
adventures
there
related
the
episode
chap
of
being
bitten
by
a
skate
supposed
to
be
dead
which
is
used
again
in
came
from
marryat
own
experience
and
he
declared
that
he
ran
away
from
school
on
account
of
the
very
indignity
that
of
being
compelled
to
wear
his
elder
brother
old
clothes
which
frank
mildmay
pleads
as
an
excuse
for
sharing
at
least
the
sentiments
of
cain
marryat
again
was
trampled
upon
and
left
for
dead
when
boarding
an
enemy
see
chap
he
saved
the
midshipman
who
had
bullied
him
from
drowning
though
his
reflections
on
the
occasion
are
more
edifying
than
those
recounted
in
chap
from
that
moment
he
says
i
have
loved
the
fellow
as
i
never
loved
friend
before
all
my
hate
is
forgotten
i
have
saved
his
life
the
defence
of
the
castle
of
rosas
chap
is
taken
straight
from
his
private
while
marshall
naval
biography
contains
an
account
of
his
volunteering
during
a
gale
to
cut
away
the
of
the
which
scarcely
pales
before
the
vigorous
passage
in
chap
xiv
on
the
of
september
in
lat
long
off
the
coast
of
new
england
a
gale
of
wind
commenced
at
and
soon
blew
with
tremendous
fury
the
was
laid
on
her
beam
ends
her
and
were
literally
blown
away
and
she
continued
in
this
extremely
perilous
situation
for
at
least
directions
were
given
to
cut
away
the
in
order
to
save
the
and
right
the
ship
but
so
great
was
the
danger
attending
such
an
operation
considered
that
not
a
man
could
be
induced
to
attempt
it
until
mr
marryat
led
the
way
his
courageous
conduct
on
this
occasion
excited
general
admiration
and
was
highly
approved
of
by
lord
james
townsend
one
of
whose
company
he
also
saved
by
jumping
overboard
at
sea
the
edition
of
contained
a
brief
memoir
of
the
author
by
florence
marryat

reprinted

called

scenes
and
adventures

life
of

here
printed
from
the
first
edition
published
in
by
henry
colborn
with
the
following
motto
on
the
my
muse
by
no
means

in
fiction
she
gathers
a
repertory
of
facts
of
course
with
some
reserve
and
slight
restriction
but
mostly
traits
of
human
things
and
acts
love
war
a
tempest
surely
there
variety
also
a
seasoning
slight
of
lubrication
a
view
too
of
that
wild
society
a
slight
glance
thrown
on
men
of
every
station
chapter
i
these
are
the
errors
and
these
are
the
fruits
of
misspending
our
prime
youth
at
the
schools
and
universities
as
we
do
either
in
learning
mere
words
or
such
things
chiefly
as
were
better
milton
my
father
was
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
considerable
property
in
my
infancy
and
childhood
i
was
weak
and
sickly
but
the
favourite
of
my
parents
beyond
all
my
brothers
and
sisters
because
they
saw
that
my
mind
was
far
superior
to
my
sickly
frame
and
feared
they
should
never
raise
me
to
manhood
contrary
however
to
their
expectations
i
surmounted
all
these
untoward
appearances
and
attracted
much
notice
from
my
liveliness
quickness
of
repartee
and
impudence
qualities
which
have
been
of
much
use
to
me
through
life
i
can
remember
that
i
was
both
a
coward
and
a
boaster
but
i
have
frequently
remarked
that
the
quality
which
we
call
cowardice
in
a
child
is
no
more
than
implying
a
greater
sense
of
danger
and
consequently
a
superior
intellect
we
are
all
naturally
cowards
education
and
observation
teach
us
to
discriminate
between
real
and
apparent
danger
pride
teaches
the
concealment
of
fear
and
habit
renders
us
indifferent
to
that
from
which
we
have
often
escaped
with
impunity
it
is
related
of
the
great
frederick
that
he
misbehaved
the
first
time
he
went
into
action
and
it
is
certain
that
a
novice
in
such
a
situation
can
no
more
command
all
his
resources
than
a
boy
when
first
bound
apprentice
to
a
shoemaker
can
make
a
pair
of
shoes
we
must
learn
our
trade
whether
it
be
to
stand
steady
before
the
enemy
or
to
stitch
a
boot
practice
alone
can
make
a
hoby
or
a
wellington
i
pass
on
to
my
when
the
most
lasting
impressions
are
made
the
foundation
of
my
moral
and
religious
instruction
had
been
laid
with
care
by
my
excellent
parents
but
alas
from
the
time
i
quitted
the
paternal
roof
not
one
stone
was
added
to
the
building
and
even
the
traces
of
what
existed
were
nearly
obliterated
by
the
deluge
of
vice
which
threatened
soon
to
overwhelm
me
sometimes
indeed
i
feebly
but
ineffectually
endeavoured
to
stem
the
torrent
at
others
i
suffered
myself
to
be
borne
along
with
all
its
fatal
rapidity
i
was
frank
generous
quick
and
mischievous
and
i
must
admit
that
a
large
portion
of
what
sailors
call
devil
was
openly
displayed
and
a
much
larger
portion
latently
deposited
in
my
brain
and
bosom
my
ruling
passion
even
in
this
early
stage
of
life
was
pride
lucifer
himself
if
he
ever
was
seven
years
old
had
not
more
if
i
have
gained
a
fair
name
in
the
service
if
i
have
led
instead
of
followed
it
must
be
ascribed
to
this
my
ruling
passion
the
world
has
often
given
me
credit
for
better
feelings
as
the
source
of
action
but
i
am
not
writing
to
conceal
and
the
truth
must
be
told
i
was
sent
to
school
to
learn
latin
and
greek
which
there
are
various
ways
of
teaching
some
tutors
attempt
the
in
my
schoolmaster
preferred
the
in
and
as
the
boatswain
said
by
the
instigation
of
a
large
knotted
stick
he
drove
knowledge
into
our
skulls
as
a
caulker
drives
oakum
into
the
seams
of
a
ship
under
such
tuition
we
made
astonishing
progress
and
whatever
my
less
desirable
acquirements
may
have
been
my
father
had
no
cause
to
complain
of
my
deficiency
in
classic
lore
superior
in
capacity
to
most
of
my
schoolfellows
i
seldom
took
the
pains
to
learn
my
lesson
previous
to
going
up
with
my
class
the
master
blessing
as
we
called
it
did
occasionally
descend
on
my
devoted
head
but
that
was
a
bagatelle
i
was
too
proud
not
to
keep
pace
with
my
equals
and
too
idle
to
do
more
had
my
schoolmaster
being
a
single
man
my
stay
under
his
care
might
have
been
prolonged
to
my
advantage
but
unfortunately
both
for
him
and
for
me
he
had
a
helpmate
and
her
peculiarly
unfortunate
disposition
was
the
means
of
corrupting
those
morals
over
which
it
was
her
duty
to
have
watched
with
the
most
assiduous
care
ruling
passions
were
suspicion
and
avarice
written
in
legible
characters
in
her
piercing
eyes
and
nose
she
never
supposed
us
capable
of
telling
the
truth
so
we
very
naturally
never
gave
ourselves
the
trouble
to
cultivate
a
useless
virtue
and
seldom
resorted
to
it
unless
it
answered
our
purpose
better
than
a
lie
this
propensity
of
mrs
higginbottom
converted
our
candour
and
honesty
into
deceit
and
fraud
never
believed
we
cared
little
about
the
accuracy
of
our
assertions
through
her
meanness
and
parsimony
we
were
little
scrupulous
as
to
the
ways
and
means
provided
we
could
satisfy
our
hunger
and
thus
we
soon
became
as
great
adepts
in
the
elegant
accomplishments
of
lying
and
thieving
under
her
tuition
as
we
did
in
greek
and
latin
under
that
of
her
husband
a
large
orchard
fields
garden
and
attached
to
the
establishment
were
under
the
care
and
superintendence
of
the
mistress
who
usually
selected
one
of
the
boys
as
her
prime
minister
and
confidential
adviser
this
boy
for
whose
education
his
parents
were
paying
some
sixty
or
eighty
pounds
per
annum
was
permitted
to
pass
his
time
in
gathering
up
the
windfalls
in
watching
the
hens
and
bringing
in
their
eggs
when
their
cackling
throats
had
announced
their
safe
accouchement
looking
after
the
broods
of
young
ducks
and
chickens
hoc
genus
in
short
doing
the
duty
of
what
is
usually
termed
the
odd
man
in
the
farmyard
how
far
the
parents
would
have
been
satisfied
with
this
arrangement
i
leave
my
readers
to
guess
but
to
us
who
preferred
the
manual
to
mental
exertion
exercise
to
restraint
and
any
description
of
cultivation
to
that
of
cultivating
the
mind
it
suited
extremely
well
and
accordingly
no
place
in
the
gift
of
government
was
ever
the
object
of
such
solicitude
and
intrigue
as
was
to
us
schoolboys
the
situation
of
collector
and
trustee
of
the
eggs
and
apples
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
early
selected
for
this
important
post
and
the
misfortune
to
lose
it
soon
after
owing
to
the
cunning
and
envy
of
my
schoolfellows
and
the
suspicion
of
my
employers
on
my
first
coming
into
office
i
had
formed
the
most
sincere
resolutions
of
honesty
and
vigilance
but
what
are
good
resolutions
when
discouraged
on
the
one
hand
by
the
revilings
of
suspicion
and
assailed
on
the
other
by
the
cravings
of
appetite
my
morning
collection
was
exacted
from
me
to
the
very
last
nut
and
the
greedy
eyes
of
my
mistress
seemed
to
inquire
for
more
suspected
when
innocent
i
became
guilty
out
of
revenge
was
detected
and
dismissed
a
successor
was
appointed
to
whom
i
surrendered
all
my
offices
of
trust
and
having
perfect
leisure
i
made
it
my
sole
business
to
supplant
him
it
was
an
axiom
in
mathematics
with
me
at
that
time
though
not
found
in
euclid
that
wherever
i
could
enter
my
head
my
whole
body
might
follow
as
a
practical
illustration
of
this
proposition
i
applied
my
head
to
the
arched
hole
of
the
door
and
by
scraping
away
a
little
dirt
contrived
to
gain
admittance
and
very
speedily
transferred
all
the
eggs
to
my
own
chest
when
the
new
purveyor
arrived
he
found
nothing
but
a
beggarly
account
of
empty
boxes
and
his
perambulations
in
the
orchard
and
garden
for
the
same
reason
were
equally
the
pilferings
of
the
orchard
and
garden
i
confiscated
as
droits
but
when
i
had
collected
a
sufficient
number
of
eggs
to
furnish
a
nest
i
gave
information
of
my
pretended
discovery
to
my
mistress
who
thinking
she
had
not
changed
for
the
better
dismissed
my
successor
and
received
me
into
favour
again
i
was
like
many
greater
men
immediately
reinstated
in
office
when
it
was
discovered
that
they
could
not
do
without
me
i
once
more
became
chancellor
of
the
and
ranger
of
the
orchard
with
greater
power
than
i
had
possessed
before
my
disgrace
had
my
mistress
looked
half
as
much
in
my
face
as
she
did
into
my
hatful
of
eggs
she
would
have
read
my
guilt
for
at
that
unsophisticated
age
i
could
blush
a
habit
long
since
discarded
in
the
course
of
my
professional
duties
in
order
to
preserve
my
credit
and
my
situation
i
no
longer
contented
myself
with
windfalls
but
assisted
nature
in
her
labours
and
greatly
lightened
the
burthen
of
many
a
loaded
by
these
means
i
not
only
gratified
the
avarice
of
my
mistress
at
her
own
expense
but
also
laid
by
a
store
for
my
own
use
on
my
restoration
to
office
i
had
an
ample
fund
in
my
exchequer
to
answer
all
present
demands
and
by
a
provident
and
industrious
anticipation
was
enabled
to
lull
the
suspicions
of
my
employers
and
to
bid
defiance
to
the
opposition
it
will
readily
be
supposed
that
a
lad
of
my
acuteness
did
not
omit
any
technical
management
for
the
purpose
of
disguise
the
fruits
which
i
presented
were
generally
soiled
with
dirt
at
the
ends
of
the
stalks
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
them
all
the
appearance
of
de
fell
of
itself
thus
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
did
i
become
an
adept
of
vice
from
the
mismanagement
of
those
into
whose
hands
i
was
intrusted
to
be
strengthened
in
religion
and
virtue
fortunately
for
me
as
far
as
my
education
was
concerned
i
did
not
long
continue
to
hold
this
honourable
and
lucrative
employment
one
of
those
unhappy
beings
called
an
usher
peeped
into
my
chest
and
by
way
of
acquiring
popularity
with
the
mistress
and
scholars
forthwith
denounced
me
to
the
higher
powers
the
proofs
of
my
peculation
were
too
glaring
and
the
amount
too
serious
to
be
passed
over
i
was
tried
convicted
condemned
sentenced
flogged
and
dismissed
in
the
course
of
and
such
was
the
degree
of
turpitude
attached
to
me
on
this
occasion
that
i
was
rendered
for
ever
incapable
of
serving
in
that
or
any
other
employment
connected
with
the
garden
or
farm
i
was
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
and
declared
to
be
the
worst
boy
in
the
school
this
in
many
points
of
view
was
too
true
but
there
was
one
boy
who
bade
fair
to
rival
me
on
the
score
of
delinquency
this
was
tom
crauford
who
from
that
day
became
my
most
intimate
friend
tom
was
a
fine
spirited
fellow
up
to
everything
loved
mischief
though
not
vicious
and
was
ready
to
support
me
in
everything
through
thick
and
thin
and
truly
i
found
him
sufficient
employment
i
threw
off
all
disguise
laughed
at
any
suggestion
of
reform
which
i
considered
as
not
only
useless
but
certain
of
subjecting
me
to
ridicule
and
contempt
among
my
associates
i
therefore
adopted
the
motto
of
some
great
man
to
be
rather
than
seem
to
be
i
led
in
every
danger
declared
war
against
all
drivellers
and
stole
everything
that
was
eatable
from
garden
orchard
or
knowing
full
well
that
whether
i
did
so
or
not
i
should
be
equally
suspected
thenceforward
all
fruit
missed
all
arrows
shot
into
pigs
all
stones
thrown
into
windows
and
all
mud
spattered
over
clean
linen
hung
out
to
dry
were
traced
to
tom
and
myself
and
with
the
usual
alacrity
of
an
arbitrary
police
the
space
between
apprehension
and
punishment
was
very
short
we
were
constantly
brought
before
the
master
and
as
regularly
dismissed
with
his
blessing
till
we
became
hardened
to
blows
and
to
shame
thus
by
the
covetousness
of
this
woman
who
was
the
grey
mare
and
the
folly
of
the
master
who
in
anything
but
greek
and
latin
was
an
ass
my
good
principles
were
nearly
eradicated
from
my
bosom
and
in
their
place
were
sown
seeds
which
very
shortly
produced
an
abundant
harvest
there
was
a
boy
at
our
school
lately
imported
from
the
east
indies
we
him
johnny
pagoda
he
was
remarkable
for
nothing
but
ignorance
impudence
great
personal
strength
and
as
we
thought
determined
resolution
he
was
about
nineteen
years
of
age
one
day
he
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
master
who
enraged
at
his
want
of
comprehension
and
attention
struck
him
over
the
head
with
a
knotted
cane
this
appeal
although
made
to
the
least
sensitive
part
of
his
frame
roused
the
indolent
asiatic
from
his
usual
torpid
state
the
weapon
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
was
snatched
out
of
the
hand
and
suspended
over
the
head
of
the
astonished
pedagogue
who
seeing
the
tables
so
suddenly
turned
against
him
made
the
signal
for
assistance
i
clapped
my
hands
shouted
bravo
lay
on
johnny
go
it
you
have
done
it
now
you
may
as
well
be
hanged
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
but
the
ushers
began
to
muster
round
the
boy
hung
aloof
and
pagoda
uncertain
which
side
the
neutrals
would
take
laid
down
his
arms
and
surrendered
at
discretion
had
the
followed
up
his
act
by
the
application
of
a
little
discipline
at
the
it
is
more
than
probable
that
a
popular
commotion
not
unlike
that
of
mas
aniello
would
have
ensued
but
the
time
was
not
come
the
indian
showed
a
white
feather
was
laughed
at
flogged
and
sent
home
to
his
friends
who
had
intended
him
for
the
bar
but
foreseeing
that
he
might
in
the
course
of
events
chance
to
cut
a
figure
on
the
wrong
side
of
it
sent
him
to
sea
where
his
valour
if
he
had
any
would
find
more
profitable
employment
this
unsuccessful
attempt
of
the
young
oriental
was
the
primary
cause
of
all
my
fame
and
celebrity
in
i
had
always
hated
school
and
this
of
all
others
seemed
to
me
the
most
hateful
the
emancipation
of
johnny
pagoda
convinced
me
that
my
deliverance
might
be
effected
in
a
similar
manner
the
train
was
laid
and
a
spark
set
it
on
fire
this
spark
was
supplied
by
the
folly
and
vanity
of
a
fat
french
these
frenchmen
are
ever
at
the
bottom
of
mischief
mrs
higginbottom
the
master
wife
had
denounced
me
to
monsieur
aristide
maugrebleu
as
a
and
as
he
was
a
creature
of
hers
he
frequently
annoyed
me
to
gratify
his
patroness
this
fellow
was
at
that
time
about
years
of
age
and
had
much
more
experience
than
agility
having
greatly
increased
his
bulk
by
the
roast
beef
and
ale
of
england
while
he
taught
us
the
rigadoons
of
his
own
country
his
vanity
induced
him
to
attempt
feats
much
above
the
cumbrous
weight
of
his
frame
i
entered
the
lists
with
him
beat
him
at
his
own
trade
and
he
beat
me
with
his
which
broke
in
two
over
my
head
then
making
one
more
glorious
effort
to
show
that
he
would
not
be
outdone
snapped
the
tendon
achilles
and
down
he
fell
de
as
a
he
was
taken
away
in
his
gig
to
be
cured
and
i
was
taken
into
the
to
be
flogged
this
i
thought
so
unjust
that
i
ran
away
tom
crauford
helped
me
to
scale
the
wall
and
when
he
supposed
i
had
got
far
enough
to
be
out
of
danger
from
pursuit
went
and
gave
information
to
avoid
the
suspicion
of
having
aided
and
abetted
after
running
a
mile
to
use
a
sea
phrase
i
hove
to
and
began
to
compose
in
my
mind
an
oration
which
i
intended
to
pronounce
before
my
father
by
way
of
apology
for
my
sudden
and
unexpected
appearance
but
i
was
interrupted
by
the
detested
usher
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
senior
boys
among
whom
was
tom
crauford
coming
behind
me
as
i
sat
on
a
stile
they
cut
short
my
meditations
by
a
tap
on
the
shoulder
collared
and
marched
me
to
the
right
about
in
double
quick
time
tom
crauford
was
one
of
those
who
held
me
and
outdid
himself
in
zealous
invective
at
my
base
ingratitude
in
absconding
from
the
best
of
masters
and
the
most
affectionate
tender
and
motherly
of
all
the
usher
swallowed
all
this
and
i
soon
made
him
swallow
a
great
deal
more
we
passed
near
the
side
of
a
pond
the
shoals
and
depths
of
which
were
well
known
to
me
i
looked
at
tom
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
and
motioned
him
to
let
me
go
and
like
a
mackerel
out
of
a
fisherman
hand
i
darted
into
the
water
got
up
to
my
middle
and
then
very
coolly
for
it
was
november
turned
round
to
gaze
at
my
escort
who
stood
at
bay
and
looked
very
much
like
fools
the
usher
like
a
low
bred
cur
when
he
could
no
longer
bully
began
to
fawn
he
entreated
and
he
implored
me
to
think
on
my
papa
and
mamma
how
miserable
they
would
be
if
they
could
but
see
me
what
an
increase
of
punishment
i
was
bringing
on
myself
by
such
obstinacy
he
held
out
by
turns
coaxes
and
threats
in
short
everything
but
an
amnesty
to
which
i
considered
myself
entitled
having
been
driven
to
rebellion
by
the
most
cruel
persecution
argument
having
failed
and
there
being
no
volunteers
to
come
in
and
fetch
me
out
of
the
water
the
poor
usher
much
against
his
inclination
was
compelled
to
undertake
it
with
shoes
and
stockings
off
and
trousers
tucked
up
he
ventured
one
foot
into
the
water
then
the
other
a
cold
shiver
reached
his
teeth
and
made
them
chatter
but
at
length
with
cautious
tread
he
advanced
towards
me
being
once
in
the
water
a
step
or
two
farther
was
no
object
to
me
particularly
as
i
knew
i
could
but
be
well
flogged
after
all
and
i
was
quite
sure
of
that
at
all
events
so
i
determined
to
have
my
revenge
and
amusement
stepping
back
he
followed
and
suddenly
fell
over
head
and
ears
into
a
hole
as
he
made
a
reach
at
me
i
was
already
out
of
my
depth
and
could
swim
like
a
duck
and
as
soon
as
he
came
up
i
perched
my
knees
on
his
shoulders
and
my
hands
on
his
head
and
sent
him
souse
under
a
second
time
keeping
him
there
until
he
had
drunk
more
water
than
any
horse
that
ever
came
to
the
pond
i
then
allowed
him
to
wallow
out
the
best
way
he
could
and
as
it
was
very
cold
i
listened
to
the
entreaties
of
tom
and
the
boys
who
stood
by
cracking
their
sides
with
laughter
at
the
poor
usher
helpless
misery
having
had
my
frolic
i
came
out
and
voluntarily
surrendered
myself
to
my
enemies
from
whom
i
received
the
same
mercy
in
proportion
that
a
russian
does
from
a
turk
dripping
wet
cold
and
covered
with
mud
i
was
first
shown
to
the
boys
as
an
aggregate
of
all
that
was
bad
in
nature
a
lecture
was
read
to
them
on
the
enormity
of
my
offence
and
solemn
denunciations
of
my
future
destiny
closed
the
discourse
the
shivering
fit
produced
by
the
cold
bath
was
relieved
by
as
sound
a
flogging
as
could
be
inflicted
while
two
ushers
held
me
but
no
effort
of
theirs
could
elicit
one
groan
or
sob
from
me
my
teeth
were
clenched
in
firm
determination
of
revenge
with
this
passion
my
bosom
glowed
and
my
brain
was
on
fire
the
punishment
though
dreadfully
severe
had
one
good
effect
it
restored
my
almost
suspended
animation
and
i
strongly
recommend
the
same
remedy
being
applied
to
all
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
from
disappointed
love
or
other
such
trifling
causes
throw
themselves
into
the
water
had
the
miserable
usher
been
treated
after
this
prescription
he
might
have
escaped
a
cold
and
rheumatic
fever
which
had
nearly
consigned
him
to
a
country
churchyard
in
all
probability
to
reappear
at
the
of
st
bartholomew
hospital
about
this
time
johnny
pagoda
who
had
been
two
years
at
sea
came
to
the
school
to
visit
his
brother
and
schoolfellows
i
pumped
this
fellow
to
tell
me
all
he
knew
he
never
tried
to
deceive
me
or
to
make
a
convert
he
had
seen
enough
of
a
midshipman
life
to
know
that
a
cockpit
was
not
paradise
but
he
gave
me
clear
and
ready
answers
to
all
my
questions
i
discovered
that
there
was
no
schoolmaster
in
the
ship
and
that
the
midshipmen
were
allowed
a
pint
of
wine
a
day
a
and
the
gallows
they
say
refuse
nothing
and
as
i
had
some
strong
presentiment
from
recent
occurrences
that
if
i
did
not
volunteer
for
the
one
i
should
in
all
probability
be
pressed
for
the
other
i
chose
the
lesser
evil
of
the
two
and
having
made
up
my
mind
to
enter
the
glorious
profession
i
shortly
after
communicated
my
intention
to
my
parents
from
the
moment
i
had
come
to
this
determination
i
cared
not
what
crime
i
committed
in
hopes
of
being
expelled
from
the
school
i
wrote
scurrilous
letters
headed
a
mutiny
entered
into
a
league
with
the
other
boys
to
sink
burn
and
destroy
and
do
all
the
mischief
we
could
tom
crauford
had
the
master
child
to
dry
nurse
he
was
only
two
years
old
tom
let
him
fall
not
intentionally
but
the
poor
child
was
a
cripple
in
consequence
of
it
for
life
this
was
an
accident
which
under
any
other
circumstances
we
should
have
deplored
but
to
us
it
was
almost
a
joke
the
cruel
treatment
i
had
received
from
these
people
had
so
demoralized
me
that
those
passions
which
under
more
skilful
or
kinder
treatment
had
either
not
been
known
or
would
have
lain
dormant
were
roused
into
full
and
malignant
activity
i
went
to
school
a
boy
i
left
it
a
savage
the
accident
with
the
child
occurred
two
days
before
the
commencement
of
the
vacation
and
we
were
all
dismissed
on
the
following
day
in
consequence
on
my
return
home
i
stated
verbally
to
my
father
and
mother
as
i
had
done
before
by
letter
that
i
was
resolved
to
go
to
sea
my
mother
wept
my
father
expostulated
i
gazed
with
apathy
on
the
one
and
listened
with
cold
indifference
to
the
reasoning
and
arguments
of
the
other
a
choice
of
schools
was
offered
to
me
where
i
might
be
a
parlour
boarder
and
i
was
to
finish
at
the
university
if
i
would
but
give
up
my
fatal
infatuation
nothing
however
would
do
the
die
was
cast
and
for
the
sea
i
was
to
prepare
what
fool
was
it
who
said
that
the
happiest
times
of
our
lives
is
passed
at
school
there
may
indeed
be
exceptions
but
the
remark
can
not
be
generalized
stormy
as
has
been
my
life
the
most
miserable
part
of
it
with
very
little
exception
was
passed
at
school
and
my
mind
never
received
so
much
injury
from
any
scenes
of
vice
and
excess
in
as
it
did
from
the
shameful
treatment
and
bad
example
i
met
with
there
if
my
bosom
burned
with
passions
whose
fault
was
it
how
had
the
sacred
pledge
given
by
the
master
been
redeemed
was
i
not
sacrificed
to
the
most
sordid
avarice
in
the
first
instance
and
almost
flayed
alive
in
the
second
to
gratify
revenge
of
the
filthy
manner
in
which
our
food
was
prepared
i
can
only
say
that
the
bare
recollection
of
it
excites
nausea
and
to
this
hour
bread
and
milk
suet
pudding
and
shoulders
of
mutton
are
objects
of
my
aversion
the
conduct
of
the
ushers
who
were
either
tyrannical
extortioners
or
partakers
in
our
crimes
the
constant
loss
of
our
clothes
by
the
dishonesty
or
carelessness
of
the
servants
the
purloining
our
silver
spoons
sheets
and
towels
when
we
went
away
upon
the
plea
of
custom
the
charges
in
the
account
for
windows
which
i
had
never
broken
and
books
which
i
had
never
received
the
shameful
difference
between
the
annual
cost
promised
by
the
master
and
the
sum
actually
charged
ought
to
have
opened
the
eyes
of
my
father
i
am
aware
how
excellent
many
of
these
institutions
are
and
that
there
are
few
so
bad
as
the
one
i
was
sent
to
the
history
of
my
life
will
prove
of
what
vital
importance
it
is
to
ascertain
the
character
of
the
master
and
mistress
as
to
other
points
besides
teaching
greek
and
latin
before
a
child
is
intrusted
to
their
care
i
ought
to
have
observed
that
during
my
stay
at
this
school
i
had
made
some
proficiency
in
mathematics
and
algebra
my
father
had
procured
for
me
a
berth
on
board
a
fine
frigate
at
plymouth
and
the
interval
between
my
nomination
and
joining
was
spent
by
my
parents
in
giving
advice
to
me
and
directions
to
the
several
tradesmen
respecting
my
equipment
the
large
chest
the
sword
the
the
were
all
ordered
in
succession
and
the
arrival
of
each
article
either
of
use
or
ornament
was
anticipated
by
me
with
a
degree
of
impatience
which
can
only
be
compared
to
that
of
a
ship
company
arrived
off
dennose
from
a
three
years
station
in
india
and
who
hope
to
be
at
anchor
at
spithead
before
sunset
the
circumstance
of
my
going
to
sea
affected
my
father
in
no
other
way
than
it
interfered
with
his
domestic
comforts
by
the
immoderate
grief
of
my
poor
mother
in
any
other
point
of
view
my
choice
of
profession
was
a
source
of
no
regret
to
him
i
had
an
elder
brother
who
was
intended
to
have
the
family
estates
and
who
was
then
at
oxford
receiving
an
education
suitable
to
his
rank
in
life
and
also
learning
how
to
spend
his
money
like
a
gentleman
younger
brothers
are
in
such
cases
just
as
well
out
of
the
way
particularly
one
of
my
turbulent
disposition
a
therefore
like
piece
of
has
its
uses
my
father
paid
all
the
bills
with
great
philosophy
and
made
me
a
liberal
allowance
for
my
age
the
hour
of
departure
drew
near
my
chest
had
been
sent
off
by
the
plymouth
waggon
and
a
drew
up
to
the
door
to
convey
me
to
the
white
horse
cellar
the
letting
down
of
the
rattling
steps
completely
overthrew
the
small
remains
of
fortitude
which
my
dearest
mother
had
reserved
for
our
separation
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
my
neck
in
a
frenzy
of
grief
i
beheld
her
emotions
with
a
countenance
as
unmoved
as
the
of
a
ship
while
she
covered
my
stoic
face
with
kisses
and
washed
it
with
her
tears
i
almost
wondered
what
it
all
meant
and
wished
the
scene
was
over
my
father
helped
me
out
of
this
dilemma
taking
me
firmly
by
the
arm
he
led
me
out
of
the
room
my
mother
sank
upon
the
sofa
and
hid
her
face
in
her
i
walked
as
slowly
to
the
coach
as
common
decency
would
permit
my
father
looked
at
me
as
if
he
would
inquire
of
my
very
inward
soul
whether
i
really
did
possess
human
feelings
i
felt
the
meaning
of
this
even
in
my
then
tender
years
and
such
was
my
sense
of
propriety
that
i
mustered
up
a
tear
for
each
eye
which
i
hope
answered
the
intended
purpose
we
say
at
sea
when
you
have
no
decency
sham
a
little
and
i
verily
believe
i
should
have
beheld
my
poor
mother
in
her
coffin
with
less
regret
than
i
could
have
foregone
the
gay
and
lovely
scenes
which
i
anticipated
how
amply
has
this
want
of
feeling
towards
a
tender
parent
been
recalled
to
my
mind
and
severely
punished
in
the
events
of
my
vagrant
life
chapter
ii
injuries
may
be
atoned
for
and
forgiven
but
insults
admit
of
no
compensation
they
degrade
the
mind
in
its
own
esteem
and
force
it
to
recover
its
level
by
junius
there
are
certain
events
in
our
lives
poetically
and
beautifully
described
by
moore
as
green
spots
in
memory
waste
such
are
the
emotions
arising
from
the
attainment
after
a
long
pursuit
of
any
darling
object
of
love
or
ambition
and
although
possession
and
subsequent
events
may
have
proved
to
us
that
we
had
overrated
our
enjoyment
and
experience
have
shown
us
that
all
is
vanity
still
recollection
dwells
with
pleasure
upon
the
beating
heart
when
the
present
only
was
enjoyed
and
the
picture
painted
by
youthful
and
sanguine
anticipation
in
glowing
and
delightful
colours
youth
only
can
feel
this
age
has
been
often
deceived
too
often
has
the
fruit
turned
to
ashes
in
the
mouth
the
old
look
forward
with
a
distrust
and
doubt
and
backward
with
sorrow
and
regret
one
of
the
days
of
my
life
was
that
on
which
i
first
mounted
the
uniform
of
a
midshipman
my
pride
and
ecstacy
were
beyond
description
i
had
discarded
the
school
and
dress
and
with
them
my
almost
stagnant
existence
like
the
chrysalis
changed
into
a
butterfly
i
fluttered
about
as
if
to
try
my
powers
and
felt
myself
a
gay
and
beautiful
creature
free
to
range
over
the
wide
domains
of
nature
clear
of
the
trammels
of
parents
or
schoolmasters
and
my
heart
bounded
within
me
at
the
thoughts
of
being
left
to
enjoy
at
my
own
discretion
the
very
acmé
of
all
the
pleasure
that
human
existence
could
afford
and
i
observe
that
in
this
as
in
most
other
cases
i
met
with
that
disappointment
which
usually
attends
us
true
it
is
that
in
the
days
of
my
youth
i
did
enjoy
myself
i
was
happy
for
a
time
if
happiness
it
could
be
called
but
dearly
have
i
paid
for
it
i
contracted
a
debt
which
i
have
been
liquidating
by
instalments
ever
since
nor
am
i
yet
emancipated
even
the
small
portion
of
felicity
that
fell
to
my
lot
on
this
memorable
morning
was
brief
in
duration
and
speedily
followed
by
chagrin
but
to
return
to
my
uniform
i
had
arrayed
myself
in
it
my
dirk
was
belted
round
my
waist
a
of
an
enormous
size
stuck
on
my
head
and
being
perfectly
satisfied
with
my
own
appearance
at
the
last
survey
which
i
had
made
in
the
glass
i
first
rang
for
the
chambermaid
under
pretence
of
telling
her
to
make
my
room
tidy
but
in
reality
that
she
might
admire
and
compliment
me
which
she
very
wisely
did
and
i
was
fool
enough
to
give
her
half
a
crown
and
a
kiss
for
i
felt
myself
quite
a
man
the
waiter
to
whom
the
chambermaid
had
in
all
probability
communicated
the
circumstance
presented
himself
and
having
made
a
low
bow
offered
the
same
compliments
and
received
the
same
reward
save
the
kiss
boots
would
in
all
probability
have
come
in
for
his
share
had
he
been
in
the
way
for
i
was
fool
enough
to
receive
all
their
fine
speeches
as
if
they
were
my
due
and
to
pay
for
them
at
the
same
time
in
ready
money
i
was
a
gudgeon
and
they
were
sharks
and
more
sharks
would
soon
have
been
about
me
for
i
heard
them
as
they
left
the
room
call
boots
and
ostler
of
course
to
assist
in
lightening
my
purse
but
i
was
too
impatient
to
wait
on
my
captain
and
see
my
ship
so
i
bounced
down
the
stairs
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
was
on
my
way
to
stonehouse
where
my
vanity
received
another
tribute
by
a
raw
recruit
of
marine
raising
his
hand
to
his
head
as
he
passed
by
me
i
took
it
as
it
was
meant
raised
my
hat
off
my
head
and
shuffled
by
with
much
one
consideration
i
own
mortified
me
this
was
that
the
did
not
appear
to
admire
me
half
so
much
as
i
admired
myself
it
never
occurred
to
me
then
that
middies
were
as
plentiful
at
plymouth
dock
as
black
boys
at
port
royal
though
perhaps
not
of
so
much
value
to
their
masters
i
will
not
shock
the
delicacy
of
my
fair
readers
by
repeating
all
the
vulgar
alliterations
with
which
my
noviciate
was
greeted
as
i
passed
in
review
before
the
ladies
of
north
corner
who
met
me
in
fore
street
unsophisticated
as
i
then
was
in
many
points
and
certainly
in
this
i
thought
them
extremely
fortunately
for
me
the
prayers
of
a
certain
description
of
people
never
prevail
otherwise
i
should
have
been
immediately
consigned
to
a
place
from
which
i
fear
all
the
masses
of
france
and
italy
would
not
have
extricated
me
i
escaped
from
these
syrens
without
being
bound
to
the
mast
like
ulysses
but
like
him
i
had
nearly
fallen
a
victim
to
a
modern
polyphemus
for
though
he
had
not
one
eye
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
after
the
manner
of
his
prototype
yet
the
rays
from
both
his
eyes
meeting
together
at
the
tip
of
his
long
nose
gave
him
very
much
that
appearance
ignorance
sheer
ignorance
in
this
as
in
many
other
cases
was
the
cause
of
my
disaster
a
party
of
officers
in
full
uniform
were
coming
from
a
oh
ho
said
i
here
come
some
of
us
i
seized
my
dirk
in
my
left
hand
as
i
saw
they
held
their
swords
and
i
stuck
my
right
hand
into
my
bosom
as
some
of
them
had
done
i
tried
to
imitate
their
erect
and
bearing
i
put
my
on
fore
and
aft
with
the
gold
rosette
dangling
between
my
two
eyes
so
that
in
looking
at
it
which
i
could
not
help
doing
i
must
have
squinted
and
i
held
my
nose
high
in
the
air
like
a
pig
in
a
hurricane
fancying
myself
as
much
an
object
of
admiration
to
them
as
i
was
to
myself
we
passed
on
opposite
tacks
and
our
respective
velocities
had
separated
us
to
the
distance
of
twenty
or
thirty
yards
when
one
of
them
called
out
to
me
in
a
voice
evidently
cracked
in
his
majesty
service
hollo
young
gentleman
come
back
here
i
concluded
i
was
going
to
be
complimented
on
the
cut
of
my
coat
to
be
asked
the
address
of
my
tailor
and
to
hear
the
rakish
sit
of
my
hat
admired
i
now
began
to
think
i
should
hear
a
contention
between
the
lords
of
the
ocean
as
to
who
should
have
me
as
a
sample
middy
on
their
and
i
was
even
framing
an
excuse
to
my
friend
for
not
joining
his
ship
judge
then
of
my
surprise
and
mortification
when
i
was
thus
accosted
in
an
angry
and
menacing
tone
by
the
oldest
of
the
officers
pray
sir
what
ship
do
you
belong
to
sir
said
i
proud
to
be
thus
interrogated
i
belong
to
his
majesty
ship
the
having
a
french
name
i
clapped
on
both
the
french
and
english
articles
as
being
more
impressive
oh
you
do
do
you
said
the
veteran
with
an
air
of
conscious
superiority
then
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
turn
round
go
down
to
mutton
cove
take
a
boat
and
have
your
person
conveyed
with
all
possible
speed
on
board
of
his
majesty
ship
the
imitating
me
and
tell
the
first
lieutenant
it
is
my
order
that
you
be
not
allowed
any
more
leave
while
the
ship
is
in
port
and
i
shall
tell
your
captain
he
must
teach
his
officers
better
manners
than
to
pass
the
without
touching
their
hats
while
this
harangue
was
going
on
i
stood
in
a
circle
of
which
i
was
the
centre
and
the
admiral
and
the
captains
formed
the
circumference
what
little
air
there
was
their
bodies
intercepted
so
that
i
was
not
only
in
a
stew
but
stupefied
into
the
bargain
there
sir
you
hear
me
you
may
go
yes
i
do
hear
you
thinks
i
but
how
the
devil
am
i
to
get
away
from
you
for
the
cruel
captains
like
round
a
stood
so
close
that
i
could
not
start
fortunately
this
my
blockade
which
they
no
doubt
intended
for
their
amusement
saved
me
for
that
time
i
recollected
myself
and
said
with
affected
simplicity
of
manner
that
i
had
that
morning
put
on
my
uniform
for
the
first
time
that
i
had
never
seen
my
captain
and
never
was
on
board
a
ship
in
all
my
life
at
this
explanation
the
countenance
of
the
admiral
relaxed
into
something
that
was
meant
for
a
smile
and
the
captains
all
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
well
young
man
said
the
admiral
who
was
really
a
fellow
though
an
odd
one
well
young
man
since
you
have
never
been
at
sea
it
is
some
excuse
for
not
knowing
good
manners
there
is
no
necessity
now
for
delivering
my
message
to
the
first
lieutenant
but
you
may
go
on
board
your
ship
having
seen
me
the
captains
opened
right
and
left
and
let
me
pass
as
i
left
them
i
heard
one
say
just
caught
marks
of
the
dogs
teeth
in
his
heels
i
warrant
you
i
did
not
stop
to
make
any
reply
but
sneaked
away
mortified
and
and
certainly
obeyed
this
the
first
order
which
i
had
ever
received
in
the
service
with
more
exactness
than
i
ever
did
any
subsequent
one
during
the
remainder
of
my
walk
i
touched
my
hat
to
every
one
i
met
i
conferred
the
honour
of
a
salute
on
midshipmen
master
mates
sergeants
of
marines
and
two
corporals
nor
was
i
aware
of
my
over
complaisance
until
a
young
woman
dressed
like
a
lady
who
knew
more
of
the
navy
than
i
did
asked
me
if
i
had
come
down
to
stand
for
the
borough
without
knowing
what
she
meant
i
replied
no
i
thought
you
might
said
she
seeing
you
are
so
d
d
civil
to
everybody
had
it
not
been
for
this
friendly
hint
i
really
believe
i
should
have
touched
my
hat
to
a
drummer
having
gone
through
this
ordeal
i
reached
the
inn
at
plymouth
where
i
found
my
captain
and
presented
my
father
letter
he
surveyed
me
from
top
to
toe
and
desired
the
pleasure
of
my
company
to
dinner
at
six
in
the
mean
time
he
said
as
it
is
now
only
eleven
you
may
go
aboard
and
show
yourself
to
mr
handstone
the
first
lieutenant
who
will
cause
your
name
to
be
entered
on
the
books
and
allow
you
to
come
back
here
to
dine
i
bowed
and
retired
and
on
my
way
to
mutton
cove
was
saluted
by
the
females
with
the
appellation
of
royal
reefer
midshipman
and
a
biscuit
nibbler
but
all
this
i
neither
understood
nor
cared
for
i
arrived
safely
at
mutton
cove
where
two
women
seeing
my
inquiring
eye
and
dress
asked
what
ship
they
should
take
my
honour
to
i
told
them
the
ship
i
wished
to
go
on
board
of
she
under
the
said
the
elder
woman
who
appeared
to
be
about
forty
years
of
age
and
we
will
take
your
honour
off
for
a
shilling
i
agreed
to
this
both
for
the
novelty
of
the
thing
as
well
as
on
account
of
my
natural
gallantry
and
love
of
female
society
the
elder
woman
was
mistress
of
her
profession
handling
her
scull
oar
with
great
dexterity
but
sally
the
younger
one
who
was
her
daughter
was
still
in
her
noviciate
she
was
pretty
cleanly
dressed
had
on
white
stockings
and
sported
a
neat
foot
and
ankle
take
care
sally
said
the
mother
keep
stroke
or
you
will
catch
a
crab
never
fear
mother
said
the
confident
sally
and
at
the
same
moment
as
if
the
very
caution
against
the
accident
was
the
cause
of
it
the
blade
of
her
scull
did
not
dip
into
the
water
the
oar
meeting
no
resistance
its
loom
or
handle
came
back
upon
the
bosom
of
the
unfortunate
sally
tipped
her
backwards
up
went
her
heels
in
the
air
and
down
fell
her
head
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
as
she
was
pulling
the
stroke
oar
her
feet
almost
came
in
contact
with
the
rosette
of
my
cocked
hat
there
now
sally
said
the
wary
mother
i
told
you
how
it
would
be
i
knew
you
would
catch
a
crab
sally
quickly
recovered
herself
blushed
a
little
and
resumed
her
occupation
that
what
we
calls
catching
a
crab
in
our
country
said
the
woman
i
replied
that
i
thought
it
was
a
very
pretty
amusement
and
i
asked
sally
to
try
and
catch
another
but
she
declined
and
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
side
of
the
ship
having
paid
my
naiads
i
took
hold
of
the
as
i
was
instructed
by
them
and
mounted
the
side
reaching
the
gangway
i
was
accosted
by
a
midshipman
in
a
round
jacket
and
trousers
a
shirt
none
of
the
cleanest
and
a
black
silk
handkerchief
tied
loosely
round
his
neck
who
did
you
want
sir
said
he
i
wish
to
speak
with
mr
handstone
the
first
lieutenant
said
i
he
informed
me
that
the
first
lieutenant
was
then
gone
down
to
frank
the
letters
and
when
he
came
on
deck
he
would
acquaint
him
with
my
being
there
after
this
dialogue
i
was
left
on
the
larboard
side
of
the
to
my
own
meditations
the
ship
was
at
this
time
refitting
and
was
what
is
usually
called
in
the
hands
of
the
dockyard
and
a
sweet
mess
she
was
in
the
carronades
were
run
fore
and
aft
the
slides
unbolted
from
the
side
the
decks
were
covered
with
pitch
fresh
poured
into
the
seams
and
the
caulkers
were
sitting
on
their
boxes
ready
to
renew
their
noisy
labours
as
soon
as
the
had
expired
the
middies
meanwhile
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
were
taking
my
altitude
and
speculating
as
to
whether
i
was
to
be
a
messmate
of
theirs
and
what
sort
of
a
chap
i
might
chance
to
be
both
these
points
were
solved
very
speedily
the
first
lieutenant
came
on
deck
the
midshipman
of
the
watch
presented
me
and
i
presented
my
name
and
the
captain
message
it
is
all
right
sir
said
mr
handstone
here
mr
flyblock
do
you
take
this
young
gentleman
into
your
mess
you
may
show
him
below
as
soon
as
you
please
and
tell
him
where
to
hang
his
hammock
up
i
followed
my
new
friend
down
the
ladder
under
the
half
deck
where
sat
a
woman
selling
bread
and
butter
and
red
herrings
to
the
sailors
she
had
also
cherries
and
clotted
cream
and
a
cask
of
strong
beer
which
seemed
to
be
in
great
demand
we
passed
her
and
descended
another
ladder
which
brought
us
to
the
and
into
the
steerage
in
the
forepart
of
which
on
the
larboard
side
abreast
of
the
mainmast
was
my
future
residence
a
small
hole
which
they
called
a
berth
it
was
ten
feet
long
by
six
and
about
five
feet
four
inches
high
a
small
aperture
about
nine
inches
square
admitted
a
very
scanty
portion
of
that
which
we
most
needed
namely
fresh
air
and
daylight
a
deal
table
occupied
a
very
considerable
extent
of
this
small
apartment
and
on
it
stood
a
brass
with
a
dip
candle
and
a
wick
like
a
fullblown
carnation
the
was
spread
and
the
stains
of
port
wine
and
gravy
too
visibly
indicated
like
the
midshipman
dirty
shirt
the
near
approach
of
sunday
the
black
servant
was
preparing
for
dinner
and
i
was
shown
the
seat
i
was
to
occupy
good
heaven
thought
i
as
i
squeezed
myself
between
the
ship
side
and
the
and
is
this
to
be
my
future
residence
better
go
back
to
school
there
at
least
there
is
fresh
air
and
clean
linen
i
would
have
written
that
moment
to
my
dear
mother
to
tell
her
how
gladly
her
prodigal
son
would
fly
back
to
her
arms
but
i
was
prevented
doing
this
first
by
pride
and
secondly
by
want
of
writing
materials
taking
my
place
therefore
at
the
table
i
mustered
up
all
my
philosophy
and
to
amuse
myself
called
to
mind
the
reflections
of
gil
blas
when
he
found
himself
in
the
den
of
the
robbers
behold
then
the
worthy
nephew
of
my
uncle
gil
perez
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
most
of
my
new
associates
were
absent
on
duty
the
was
crammed
with
casks
and
cases
and
chests
and
bags
and
hammocks
the
noise
of
the
caulkers
was
resumed
over
my
head
and
all
around
me
the
stench
of
combining
with
the
smoke
of
tobacco
the
effluvia
of
gin
and
beer
the
frying
of
and
onions
and
red
herrings
the
pressure
of
a
dark
atmosphere
and
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
all
conspired
to
oppress
my
spirits
and
render
me
the
most
miserable
dog
that
ever
lived
i
had
almost
resigned
myself
to
despair
when
i
recollected
the
captain
invitation
and
mentioned
it
to
flyblock
that
well
thought
of
said
he
murphy
also
dines
with
him
you
can
both
go
together
and
i
dare
say
he
will
be
very
glad
of
your
company
a
captain
seldom
waits
for
a
midshipman
and
we
took
good
care
he
should
not
wait
for
us
the
dinner
was
in
all
respects
one
on
service
the
captain
said
a
great
deal
the
lieutenants
very
little
and
the
midshipmen
nothing
at
all
but
the
performance
of
the
knife
and
fork
and
as
far
as
it
could
be
got
at
were
exactly
in
the
inverse
ratio
the
company
consisted
of
my
own
captain
and
two
others
our
first
lieutenant
murphy
and
myself
as
soon
as
the
cloth
was
removed
the
captain
filled
me
out
a
glass
of
wine
desired
i
would
drink
it
and
then
go
and
see
how
the
wind
was
i
took
this
my
first
admonitory
hint
in
its
literal
sense
and
meaning
but
having
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
the
points
of
the
compass
i
own
i
felt
a
little
puzzled
how
i
should
obtain
the
necessary
information
fortunately
for
me
there
was
a
weathercock
on
the
old
it
had
four
letters
which
i
certainly
did
know
were
meant
to
represent
the
cardinal
points
one
of
these
seemed
so
exactly
to
correspond
with
the
dial
above
it
that
i
made
up
my
mind
the
wind
must
be
west
and
instantly
returned
to
give
my
captain
the
desired
information
not
a
little
proud
with
my
success
in
having
obtained
it
so
soon
but
what
was
my
surprise
to
find
that
i
was
not
thanked
for
my
trouble
the
company
even
smiled
and
winked
at
each
other
the
first
lieutenant
nodded
his
head
and
said
rather
green
yet
the
captain
however
settled
the
point
according
to
the
manners
and
customs
in
such
cases
used
at
sea
here
youngster
said
he
here
is
another
glass
for
you
drink
that
and
then
murphy
will
show
you
what
i
mean
murphy
was
my
chaperon
he
swallowed
his
wine
rather
gorge
put
down
his
glass
very
energetically
and
bowing
left
the
room
when
we
had
got
fairly
into
the
hall
we
had
the
following
duet
what
the
h
brought
you
back
again
you
d
d
young
greenhorn
could
not
you
take
a
hint
and
be
off
as
the
captain
intended
so
i
must
lose
my
wine
for
such
a
d
d
young
whelp
as
you
i
pay
you
off
for
this
my
tight
fellow
before
we
have
been
many
weeks
together
i
listened
to
this
elegant
harangue
with
some
impatience
and
much
more
indignation
i
came
back
said
i
to
tell
the
captain
how
the
wind
was
you
be
d
d
replied
murphy
do
you
think
the
captain
did
not
know
how
the
wind
was
and
if
he
had
wanted
to
know
do
you
think
he
would
have
sent
a
sailor
like
me
instead
of
such
a
d
d
lubberly
whelp
as
you
as
to
what
the
captain
meant
said
i
i
do
not
know
i
did
as
i
was
bid
but
what
do
you
mean
by
calling
me
a
whelp
i
am
no
more
a
whelp
than
yourself
oh
you
are
not
you
said
murphy
seizing
me
by
one
of
my
ears
which
he
pulled
so
unmercifully
that
he
altered
the
shape
of
it
very
considerably
making
it
something
like
the
leeboard
of
a
dutch
schuyt
this
was
not
to
be
borne
though
as
i
was
but
thirteen
he
seventeen
and
a
very
stout
fellow
i
should
rather
not
have
sought
an
action
with
him
but
he
had
begun
it
my
honour
was
at
stake
and
i
only
wonder
i
had
not
drawn
my
dirk
and
laid
him
dead
at
my
feet
fortunately
for
him
the
rage
i
was
in
made
me
forget
i
had
it
by
my
side
though
i
remembered
my
uniform
the
disgrace
brought
upon
it
and
the
admiration
of
the
chambermaid
as
well
as
the
salute
of
the
sentinel
all
which
formed
a
combustible
in
my
brain
i
went
off
like
a
flash
and
darted
my
fist
the
weapon
i
had
been
most
accustomed
to
wield
into
the
left
eye
of
my
adversary
with
a
force
and
precision
which
crib
would
have
applauded
murphy
staggered
back
with
the
blow
and
for
a
moment
i
flattered
myself
he
had
had
enough
of
it
but
no
alas
this
was
a
day
of
disappointments
he
had
only
retreated
to
take
a
spring
he
then
came
on
me
like
the
lifeguards
at
waterloo
and
his
charge
was
irresistible
i
was
upset
pummelled
thumped
kicked
and
should
probably
have
been
the
subject
of
a
inquest
had
not
the
waiter
and
chambermaid
run
in
to
my
rescue
the
tongue
of
the
latter
was
particularly
active
in
my
favour
unluckily
for
me
she
had
no
other
weapon
near
her
or
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
murphy
shame
said
she
for
such
a
great
lubberly
creature
to
beat
such
a
poor
little
innocent
defenceless
fellow
as
that
what
would
his
mamma
say
to
see
him
treated
so
d
n
his
mamma
and
you
too
said
pat
look
at
my
eye
d
n
your
eye
said
the
waiter
it
a
pity
he
had
not
served
the
other
one
the
same
way
no
more
than
you
deserve
for
striking
a
child
the
boy
is
game
and
that
more
than
you
are
he
is
worth
as
many
of
you
as
will
stand
between
this
and
the
iron
chair
at
barbican
i
like
to
see
him
duck
in
it
said
the
maid
while
this
was
going
on
i
had
resumed
my
defensive
attitude
i
had
never
once
complained
and
had
gained
the
of
all
the
bystanders
among
whom
now
appeared
my
captain
and
his
friends
the
blood
was
streaming
from
my
mouth
and
i
bore
the
marks
of
discipline
from
the
superior
prowess
of
my
enemy
who
was
a
noted
pugilist
for
his
age
and
would
not
have
received
the
hit
from
me
if
he
had
supposed
my
presumption
would
have
led
me
to
attack
him
the
captain
demanded
an
explanation
murphy
told
the
story
in
his
own
way
and
gave
anything
but
the
true
version
i
could
have
beaten
him
at
that
but
truth
answered
my
purpose
better
than
falsehood
on
this
occasion
so
as
soon
as
he
had
done
i
gave
my
round
unvarnished
tale
and
although
defeated
in
the
field
i
plainly
saw
that
i
had
the
advantage
of
him
in
the
cabinet
murphy
was
dismissed
in
disgrace
and
ordered
to
rusticate
on
board
till
his
eye
was
bright
i
should
have
confined
you
to
the
ship
myself
said
the
captain
but
the
boy
has
done
it
for
me
you
can
not
appear
on
shore
with
that
black
eye
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
was
admonished
to
be
more
careful
in
future
you
are
said
the
captain
like
a
young
bear
all
your
sorrows
are
before
you
if
you
give
a
blow
for
every
hard
name
you
receive
your
fate
in
the
service
may
be
foreseen
if
weak
you
will
be
pounded
to
a
mummy
if
strong
you
will
be
hated
a
quarrelsome
disposition
will
make
you
enemies
in
every
rank
you
may
attain
you
will
be
watched
with
a
jealous
eye
well
knowing
as
we
all
do
that
the
same
spirit
of
insolence
and
overbearing
which
you
show
in
the
cockpit
will
follow
you
to
the
and
rise
with
you
in
the
service
this
advice
is
for
your
own
good
not
that
i
interfere
in
these
things
as
everybody
and
everything
finds
its
level
in
a
i
only
wish
you
to
draw
a
line
between
resistance
against
oppression
which
i
admire
and
respect
and
a
litigious
uncompromising
disposition
which
i
despise
now
wash
your
face
and
go
on
board
try
by
all
means
to
conciliate
the
rest
of
your
messmates
for
first
impressions
are
everything
and
rely
on
it
murphy
report
will
not
be
in
your
favour
this
advice
was
very
good
but
had
the
disadvantage
of
coming
too
late
for
that
occasion
by
at
least
half
an
hour
the
fracas
was
owing
to
the
captain
mismanagement
and
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
navy
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
conversation
at
the
tables
of
the
higher
ranks
of
the
service
in
those
days
unless
ladies
were
present
was
generally
such
as
a
boy
could
not
listen
to
without
injury
to
his
better
feelings
i
was
therefore
hinted
off
but
with
due
respect
to
my
captain
who
is
still
living
i
should
have
been
sent
on
board
of
my
ship
and
cautioned
against
the
bad
habits
of
the
natives
of
north
corner
and
barbican
and
if
i
could
not
be
admitted
to
the
mysterious
conversation
of
a
captain
table
i
should
have
been
told
in
a
clear
and
decided
manner
to
depart
without
the
needless
puzzle
of
an
innuendo
which
i
did
not
and
could
not
understand
i
returned
on
board
about
eight
where
murphy
had
gone
before
me
and
prepared
a
reception
far
from
agreeable
instead
of
being
welcomed
to
my
berth
i
was
received
with
coldness
and
i
returned
to
the
where
i
walked
till
i
was
weary
and
then
leaned
against
a
gun
from
this
temporary
alleviation
i
was
roused
by
a
voice
of
thunder
lean
off
that
gun
i
started
up
touched
my
hat
and
continued
my
solitary
walk
looking
now
and
then
at
the
second
lieutenant
who
had
thus
gruffly
addressed
me
i
felt
a
dejection
of
spirits
a
sense
of
destitution
and
misery
which
i
can
not
describe
i
had
done
no
wrong
yet
i
was
suffering
as
if
i
had
committed
a
crime
i
had
been
aggrieved
and
had
vindicated
myself
as
well
as
i
could
i
thought
i
was
among
devils
and
not
men
my
thoughts
turned
homeward
i
remembered
my
poor
mother
in
her
agony
of
grief
on
the
sofa
and
my
unfeeling
heart
then
found
that
it
needed
the
soothings
of
affection
i
could
have
wept
but
i
knew
not
where
to
go
for
i
could
not
be
seen
to
cry
on
board
of
ship
my
pride
began
to
be
humbled
i
felt
the
misery
of
dependence
although
not
wanting
pecuniary
resources
and
would
have
given
up
all
my
prospects
to
have
been
once
more
seated
quietly
at
home
the
first
lieutenant
came
on
board
soon
after
and
i
heard
him
relating
my
adventure
to
the
second
lieutenant
the
tide
now
evidently
turned
in
my
favour
i
was
invited
down
to
the
and
having
given
satisfactory
answers
to
all
the
questions
put
to
me
flyblock
was
sent
for
and
i
was
once
more
placed
under
his
protection
the
patronage
of
the
first
lieutenant
i
flattered
myself
would
have
ensured
me
at
least
common
civility
for
a
short
time
i
had
now
more
leisure
to
contemplate
my
new
residence
and
new
associates
who
having
returned
from
the
duty
of
the
were
all
assembled
in
the
berth
seated
round
the
table
on
the
lockers
which
paid
the
double
debt
of
seats
and
receptacles
but
in
order
to
obtain
a
sitting
it
was
requisite
either
to
climb
over
the
backs
of
the
company
or
submit
to
high
pressure
from
the
last
comer
such
close
contact
even
with
our
best
friends
is
never
desirable
but
in
warm
weather
in
a
close
confined
air
with
a
manifest
scarcity
of
clean
linen
it
became
particularly
inconvenient
the
population
here
very
far
exceeded
the
limits
usually
allotted
to
human
beings
in
any
situation
of
life
except
in
a
slave
ship
the
midshipmen
of
whom
there
were
eight
and
four
youngsters
were
without
either
jackets
or
waistcoats
some
of
them
had
their
rolled
up
either
to
prevent
the
reception
or
to
conceal
the
absorption
of
dirt
in
the
region
of
the
wristbands
the
repast
on
the
table
consisted
of
a
can
or
large
of
small
beer
and
a
japan
full
of
to
compensate
for
this
simple
fare
and
at
the
same
time
to
cool
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
berth
the
table
was
covered
with
a
large
green
cloth
with
a
yellow
border
and
many
yellow
spots
withal
where
the
colour
had
been
discharged
by
slops
of
vinegar
hot
tea
c
a
sack
of
potatoes
stood
in
one
corner
and
the
shelves
all
round
and
close
over
our
heads
were
stuffed
with
plates
glasses
quadrants
knives
and
forks
loaves
of
sugar
dirty
stockings
and
shirts
and
still
fouler
small
and
ditto
large
clothes
brushes
and
shoe
brushes
dirks
german
flutes
mahogany
a
plate
of
salt
butter
and
some
two
or
three
pairs
of
naval
a
single
candle
served
to
make
darkness
visible
and
the
stench
had
nearly
overpowered
me
the
reception
i
met
with
tended
in
no
way
to
relieve
these
horrible
impressions
a
black
man
with
no
other
dress
than
a
dirty
check
shirt
and
trousers
not
smelling
of
amber
stood
within
the
door
ready
to
obey
all
and
any
one
of
the
commands
with
which
he
was
loaded
the
smell
of
the
towel
he
held
in
his
hand
to
wipe
the
plates
and
glasses
with
completed
my
discomfiture
and
i
fell
sick
upon
the
seat
nearest
at
me
recovering
from
this
without
the
aid
of
any
ministering
angel
i
contracted
the
pupils
of
my
eyes
and
ventured
to
look
around
me
the
first
who
met
my
gaze
was
my
recent
foe
he
bore
the
marks
of
contention
by
having
his
eye
bound
up
with
brown
paper
and
a
dirty
silk
the
other
was
quickly
turned
on
me
and
with
a
savage
and
brutal
countenance
he
swore
and
denounced
the
severest
vengeance
on
me
for
what
i
had
done
in
this
he
was
joined
by
another
fellow
with
large
whiskers
i
shall
not
repeat
the
elegant
philippics
with
which
i
was
greeted
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
found
all
the
big
ones
against
me
and
the
little
ones
neuter
the
caterer
supposing
i
had
received
suitable
admonition
for
my
future
guidance
and
that
i
was
completely
bound
over
to
keep
the
peace
turned
all
the
youngsters
out
of
the
berth
as
for
you
mr
fistycuff
said
he
addressing
himself
to
me
you
may
walk
off
with
the
rest
of
the
gang
so
make
yourself
scarce
like
the
highlander
breeches
the
boys
all
obeyed
the
command
in
silence
and
i
was
not
sorry
to
follow
them
as
i
went
out
he
added
so
mr
rumbusticus
you
can
obey
orders
i
see
and
it
is
well
for
you
for
i
had
a
biscuit
ready
to
shy
at
your
head
this
affront
after
all
i
had
suffered
i
was
forced
to
pocket
but
i
could
not
understand
what
the
admiral
could
mean
when
he
said
that
people
went
to
sea
to
learn
manners
i
soon
made
acquaintance
with
the
younger
set
of
my
messmates
and
we
retreated
to
the
forecastle
as
the
only
part
of
the
ship
suitable
to
the
nature
of
the
conversation
we
intended
to
hold
after
one
deliberation
and
notwithstanding
it
was
the
first
night
i
had
ever
been
on
board
a
ship
i
was
unanimously
elected
leader
of
this
little
band
i
became
the
william
tell
of
the
party
as
having
been
the
first
to
resist
the
tyranny
of
the
oldsters
and
especially
of
the
tyrant
murphy
i
was
let
into
all
the
secrets
of
the
mess
in
which
the
youngsters
were
placed
by
the
captain
to
be
instructed
and
kept
in
order
alas
what
instruction
did
we
get
but
blasphemy
what
order
were
we
kept
in
except
that
of
paying
our
mess
and
being
forbidden
to
partake
of
those
articles
which
our
money
had
purchased
my
blood
boiled
when
they
related
all
they
had
suffered
and
i
vowed
i
would
sooner
die
than
submit
to
such
treatment
the
hour
of
arrived
i
was
instructed
how
to
get
into
my
hammock
and
laughed
at
for
tumbling
out
on
the
opposite
side
i
was
forced
to
submit
to
this
pride
of
conscious
superiority
of
these
urchins
who
could
only
boast
of
a
few
months
more
practical
experience
than
myself
and
who
therefore
called
me
a
greenhorn
but
all
this
was
done
in
good
nature
and
after
a
few
hearty
laughs
from
my
companions
i
gained
the
centre
of
my
suspended
bed
and
was
very
soon
in
a
sound
sleep
this
was
only
allowed
to
last
till
about
four
in
the
morning
when
down
came
the
head
of
my
hammock
and
i
fell
to
the
deck
with
my
feet
still
hanging
in
the
air
like
poor
sally
when
she
caught
the
crab
stunned
and
stupefied
by
the
fall
bewildered
by
the
violent
concussion
and
the
novelty
of
all
around
me
i
continued
in
a
state
of
somnambulism
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
i
could
recollect
myself
the
marine
sentinel
at
the
door
seeing
what
had
happened
and
also
espying
the
person
to
whom
i
was
indebted
for
this
favour
very
kindly
came
to
my
assistance
he
knotted
my
lanyard
and
restored
my
hammock
to
its
place
but
he
could
not
persuade
me
to
confide
myself
again
to
such
treacherous
bedposts
for
i
thought
the
rope
had
broken
and
so
strongly
did
the
fear
of
another
tumble
possess
my
mind
that
i
took
a
blanket
and
lay
down
on
a
chest
at
some
little
distance
keeping
a
sleepless
eye
directed
to
the
scene
of
my
late
disaster
this
was
fortunate
for
not
many
minutes
had
elapsed
when
murphy
who
had
been
relieved
from
the
middle
watch
came
below
and
seeing
my
hammock
again
hanging
up
and
supposing
me
in
it
took
out
his
knife
and
cut
it
down
so
then
said
i
to
myself
it
was
you
who
invaded
my
slumbers
and
nearly
dashed
my
brains
out
and
have
now
made
the
second
attempt
i
vowed
to
heaven
that
i
would
have
revenge
and
i
acquitted
myself
of
that
vow
like
the
north
american
savage
crouching
lest
he
should
see
me
i
waited
patiently
till
he
had
got
into
his
hammock
and
was
in
a
sound
sleep
i
then
gently
pushed
a
under
the
head
of
his
hammock
and
placed
the
corner
of
it
so
as
to
receive
his
head
for
had
it
split
his
skull
i
should
not
have
cared
so
exasperated
was
i
and
so
bent
on
revenge
subtle
and
silent
i
then
cut
his
lanyard
he
fell
and
his
head
coming
in
contact
with
the
edge
of
the
he
gave
a
deep
groan
and
there
he
lay
i
instantly
retreated
to
my
chest
and
blanket
where
i
pretended
to
snore
while
the
sentinel
who
fortunately
for
me
had
seen
murphy
cut
me
down
the
first
time
came
with
his
lanthorn
and
seeing
him
apparently
dead
removed
the
out
of
the
way
and
then
ran
to
the
sergeant
of
marines
desiring
him
to
bring
the
surgeon
assistant
while
the
sergeant
was
gone
he
whispered
softly
to
me
lie
still
i
saw
the
whole
of
it
and
if
you
are
found
out
it
may
go
hard
with
you
murphy
it
appeared
had
few
friends
in
the
ship
all
rejoiced
at
his
accident
i
laid
very
quietly
in
my
blanket
while
the
assistant
dressed
the
wound
and
after
a
considerable
time
succeeded
in
restoring
the
patient
to
his
senses
he
was
however
confined
a
fortnight
to
his
bed
i
was
either
not
suspected
or
if
i
was
it
was
known
that
i
was
not
the
aggressor
the
secret
was
well
kept
i
gave
the
marine
a
guinea
and
took
him
into
my
service
as
de
and
now
reader
in
justice
to
myself
allow
me
to
make
a
few
remarks
they
may
serve
as
a
palliative
to
a
certain
degree
for
that
unprincipled
career
which
the
following
pages
will
expose
the
passions
of
pride
and
revenge
implanted
in
our
fallen
natures
and
which
if
not
eradicated
in
the
course
of
my
education
ought
at
least
to
have
lain
dormant
as
long
as
possible
were
through
the
injudicious
conduct
of
those
to
whom
i
had
been
entrusted
called
into
action
and
full
activity
at
a
very
early
age
the
moral
seeds
sown
by
my
parents
which
might
have
germinated
and
produced
fruit
were
not
watered
or
attended
to
weeds
had
usurped
their
place
and
were
occupying
the
ground
which
should
have
supported
them
and
at
this
period
when
the
most
assiduous
cultivation
was
necessary
to
procure
a
return
into
what
a
situation
was
i
thrown
in
a
ship
crowded
with
three
hundred
men
each
of
them
or
nearly
so
cohabiting
with
an
unfortunate
female
in
the
lowest
state
of
degradation
where
oaths
and
blasphemy
interlarded
every
sentence
where
religion
was
wholly
neglected
and
the
only
honour
paid
to
the
almighty
was
a
clean
shirt
on
a
sunday
where
implicit
obedience
to
the
will
of
an
officer
was
considered
of
more
importance
than
the
observance
of
the
decalogue
and
the
commandments
of
god
were
in
a
manner
abrogated
by
the
articles
of
war
for
the
first
might
be
broken
with
impunity
and
even
with
applause
while
the
most
severe
punishment
awaited
any
infraction
of
the
latter
so
much
for
the
ship
in
the
aggregate
let
us
now
survey
the
midshipmen
berth
here
we
found
the
same
language
and
the
same
manners
with
scarcely
one
shade
more
of
refinement
their
only
pursuits
when
on
shore
were
intoxication
and
worse
debauchery
to
be
gloried
in
and
boasted
of
when
they
returned
on
board
my
captain
said
that
everything
found
its
level
in
a
true
but
in
a
midshipman
berth
it
was
the
level
of
a
savage
where
corporal
strength
was
the
qua
and
decided
whether
you
were
to
act
the
part
of
a
tyrant
or
a
slave
the
discipline
of
public
schools
bad
and
demoralizing
as
it
is
was
light
compared
to
the
tyranny
of
a
midshipman
berth
in
a
mistaken
notion
has
long
prevailed
that
boys
derive
advantages
from
suffering
under
the
tyranny
of
their
oppressors
at
schools
and
we
constantly
hear
the
praises
of
public
schools
and
midshipmen
berths
on
this
very
account
namely
that
boys
are
taught
to
find
their
level
i
do
not
mean
to
deny
but
that
the
higher
orders
improve
by
collision
with
their
inferiors
and
that
a
young
aristocrat
is
often
brought
to
his
senses
by
receiving
a
sound
thrashing
from
the
son
of
a
tradesman
but
he
that
is
brought
up
a
slave
will
be
a
tyrant
when
he
has
the
power
the
worst
of
our
passions
are
nourished
to
inflict
the
same
evil
on
others
which
we
boast
of
having
suffered
ourselves
the
courage
and
daring
spirit
of
a
boy
is
rather
broken
down
by
which
he
has
not
the
power
to
resist
or
surmounting
all
this
he
proudly
imbibes
a
dogged
spirit
of
sullen
resistance
and
implacable
revenge
which
become
the
bane
of
his
future
life
the
latter
was
my
fate
and
let
not
my
readers
be
surprised
or
shocked
if
in
the
course
of
these
adventures
i
should
display
some
of
the
fruits
of
that
fatal
seed
so
early
and
so
profusely
sown
in
my
bosom
if
on
my
first
coming
into
the
ship
i
shrank
back
with
horror
at
the
sound
of
blasphemy
and
obscenity
if
i
shut
my
eyes
to
the
promiscuous
intercourse
of
the
sexes
it
was
not
so
long
by
insensible
degrees
i
became
familiarised
with
vice
and
callous
to
its
approach
in
a
few
months
i
had
become
nearly
as
corrupt
as
others
i
might
indeed
have
resisted
longer
but
though
the
fortress
of
virtue
could
have
held
out
against
open
violence
it
could
not
withstand
the
undermining
of
ridicule
my
young
companions
who
as
i
have
observed
had
only
preceded
me
six
months
in
the
service
were
already
grown
old
in
depravity
they
laughed
at
my
squeamishness
called
me
milksop
and
miss
and
soon
made
me
as
bad
as
themselves
we
had
not
quite
attained
the
age
of
perpetration
but
we
were
fully
prepared
to
meet
it
when
it
came
i
had
not
been
two
days
on
board
when
the
youngsters
proposed
a
walk
into
the
main
top
i
mounted
the
rigging
with
perfect
confidence
for
i
was
always
a
good
climber
but
i
had
not
proceeded
far
when
i
was
overtaken
by
the
captain
of
the
top
and
another
man
who
without
any
ceremony
or
preface
seized
me
by
each
arm
and
very
deliberately
lashed
me
fast
in
the
rigging
they
laughed
at
my
remonstrance
i
asked
what
they
meant
and
the
captain
of
the
top
said
very
civilly
taking
off
his
hat
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
the
way
all
gemmen
were
sarved
when
they
first
went
aloft
and
i
must
pay
my
footing
as
a
bit
of
a
parkazite
i
looked
down
to
the
for
assistance
but
every
one
there
was
laughing
at
me
and
even
the
very
little
rogues
of
midshipmen
who
had
enticed
me
up
were
enjoying
the
joke
seeing
this
was
the
case
i
only
asked
what
was
to
pay
the
captain
of
the
top
said
a
seven
shilling
bit
would
be
thought
handsome
this
i
promised
to
give
and
was
released
on
my
own
recognizances
when
i
reached
the
i
paid
the
money
having
experienced
nothing
but
cruelty
and
oppression
since
i
had
been
on
board
i
sorely
repented
of
coming
to
sea
my
only
solace
was
seeing
murphy
as
he
lay
in
his
hammock
with
his
head
bound
up
this
was
a
balm
to
me
i
bide
my
time
said
i
i
will
yet
be
revenged
on
all
of
you
and
so
i
was
i
let
none
escape
i
had
them
all
in
their
turns
and
glutted
my
thirst
for
revenge
i
had
been
three
weeks
on
board
when
the
ship
was
reported
ready
for
sea
i
had
acquired
the
favour
of
the
first
lieutenant
by
a
constant
attention
to
the
little
duties
he
gave
me
to
perform
i
had
been
put
into
a
watch
and
stationed
in
the
and
quartered
at
the
foremast
guns
on
the
main
deck
i
was
told
by
the
youngsters
that
the
first
lieutenant
was
a
harsh
officer
and
implacable
when
once
he
took
a
dislike
his
manners
however
even
when
under
the
greatest
excitement
were
always
those
of
a
perfect
gentleman
and
i
continued
living
on
good
terms
with
him
but
with
the
second
lieutenant
i
was
not
so
fortunate
he
had
ordered
me
to
take
the
and
bring
off
a
woman
whom
he
kept
i
remonstrated
and
refused
and
from
that
moment
we
never
were
friends
murphy
had
also
recovered
from
his
fall
and
returned
to
his
duty
his
malice
towards
me
increased
and
i
had
no
peace
or
comfort
in
his
presence
one
day
he
threw
a
biscuit
at
my
head
calling
me
at
the
same
time
a
name
which
reflected
on
the
legitimacy
of
my
birth
in
language
the
most
coarse
and
vulgar
in
a
moment
all
the
admonitions
which
i
had
received
and
all
my
sufferings
for
impetuosity
of
temper
were
forgotten
the
blood
boiled
in
my
veins
and
trickled
from
my
wounded
forehead
dizzy
and
almost
sightless
with
rage
i
seized
a
brass
candlestick
the
bottom
of
which
to
keep
it
steady
at
sea
was
loaded
with
lead
and
threw
it
at
him
with
all
my
might
had
it
taken
effect
as
i
intended
that
offence
would
have
been
his
last
it
missed
his
head
and
struck
the
black
servant
on
the
shoulder
the
poor
man
went
howling
to
the
surgeon
in
whose
care
he
remained
for
many
days
murphy
started
up
to
take
instant
vengeance
but
was
held
by
the
other
seniors
of
the
mess
who
unanimously
declared
that
such
an
offence
as
mine
should
be
punished
in
a
more
solemn
manner
a
mock
trial
without
adverting
to
the
provocation
i
had
received
found
me
guilty
of
insubordination
to
the
oldsters
and
setting
a
bad
example
to
the
youngsters
i
was
sentenced
to
be
with
a
worsted
stocking
filled
with
wet
sand
i
was
held
down
on
my
face
on
the
by
four
stout
midshipmen
the
surgeon
assistant
held
my
wrist
to
ascertain
if
my
pulse
indicated
exhaustion
while
murphy
at
his
own
particular
request
became
the
executioner
had
it
been
any
other
but
him
i
should
have
given
vent
to
my
agonizing
pain
by
screams
but
like
a
sullen
ebo
i
was
resolved
to
endure
even
to
death
rather
than
gratify
him
by
any
expression
of
pain
after
a
most
severe
punishment
a
cold
sweat
and
faintness
alarmed
the
surgeon
assistant
i
was
then
released
but
ordered
to
mess
on
my
chest
for
a
fortnight
by
myself
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
stand
and
had
recovered
my
breath
i
declared
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
a
repetition
of
the
offence
should
produce
the
action
for
which
i
had
suffered
and
i
would
then
appeal
to
the
captain
for
justice
and
said
i
turning
to
murphy
it
was
i
who
cut
down
your
hammock
and
had
very
nearly
knocked
out
your
brains
i
did
it
in
return
for
your
cowardly
attack
on
me
and
i
will
do
it
again
if
i
surfer
martyrdom
for
it
for
every
act
of
tyranny
you
commit
i
will
have
revenge
try
me
now
and
see
if
i
am
not
as
good
as
my
word
he
grinned
and
turned
pale
but
dared
do
no
more
for
he
was
a
coward
i
was
ordered
to
quit
the
berth
which
i
did
and
as
i
went
out
one
of
the
mates
observed
that
i
was
a
proper
malignant
devil
by
g
this
violent
scene
produced
a
sort
of
cessation
from
hostilities
murphy
knew
that
he
might
expect
a
decanter
at
his
head
or
a
knife
in
his
side
if
i
was
provoked
and
that
peace
which
i
could
not
gain
from
his
compassion
i
obtained
from
his
fears
the
affair
made
a
noise
in
the
ship
with
the
officers
in
the
i
lost
ground
because
it
was
misrepresented
with
the
men
i
gained
favour
because
they
hated
murphy
they
saw
the
truth
and
admired
me
for
my
determined
resistance
sent
to
coventry
by
the
officers
i
sought
the
society
of
the
men
i
learned
rapidly
the
practical
part
of
my
duty
and
profited
by
the
uncouth
criticism
of
these
rough
warriors
on
the
defective
seamanship
of
their
superiors
a
sort
of
compact
was
made
between
us
they
promised
that
whenever
they
deserted
it
should
not
be
from
my
boat
when
on
duty
and
i
promised
to
let
them
go
and
drink
at
as
long
as
i
could
spare
them
in
spite
however
of
this
mutual
understanding
two
of
them
violated
their
faith
the
night
before
we
went
to
sea
and
left
the
boat
of
which
i
had
charge
and
as
i
had
disobeyed
orders
in
letting
them
go
to
a
i
was
on
my
return
to
the
ship
dismissed
from
the
and
ordered
to
do
my
duty
in
the
chapter
iii
the
might
of
england
to
anticipate
the
same
and
her
van
the
fleeter
the
deadly
space
between
hearts
of
oak
our
captains
cried
when
each
gun
from
its
adamantine
lips
spread
a
round
the
ships
like
the
hurricane
eclipse
of
the
sun
campbell
considering
my
youth
and
inexperience
and
the
trifling
neglect
of
which
i
was
accused
there
are
few
even
of
the
most
rigid
disciplinarians
who
will
not
admit
that
i
was
both
unjustly
and
unkindly
treated
by
the
first
lieutenant
who
certainly
with
all
my
respect
for
him
had
lent
himself
to
my
enemies
the
second
lieutenant
and
mr
murphy
did
not
even
conceal
their
feelings
on
the
occasion
but
exulted
over
my
disgrace
the
ship
was
suddenly
ordered
to
portsmouth
where
the
captain
who
had
been
on
leave
was
expected
to
join
us
which
he
did
soon
after
our
arrival
when
the
first
lieutenant
made
his
reports
of
good
and
bad
conduct
during
his
absence
i
had
been
about
ten
days
doing
duty
in
the
and
it
was
the
intention
of
mr
handstone
to
which
the
captain
seemed
not
disinclined
to
have
given
me
a
flogging
at
the
gun
as
a
gratuity
for
losing
the
men
this
part
of
the
sentence
however
was
not
executed
i
continued
a
member
of
the
mess
but
was
not
allowed
to
enter
the
berth
my
meals
were
sent
to
me
and
i
took
them
on
my
chest
the
youngsters
spoke
to
me
but
only
by
stealth
being
afraid
of
the
oldsters
who
had
sent
me
to
the
most
rigid
coventry
my
situation
in
the
was
nearly
nominal
i
went
aloft
when
the
hands
were
called
or
in
my
watch
and
amused
myself
with
a
book
until
we
went
below
unless
there
was
any
little
duty
for
me
to
do
which
did
not
appear
above
my
strength
the
men
doated
on
me
as
a
martyr
in
their
cause
and
delighted
in
giving
me
every
instruction
in
the
art
of
knotting
and
splicing
rigging
reefing
furling
c
and
i
honestly
own
that
the
happiest
hours
i
had
passed
in
that
ship
were
during
my
seclusion
among
these
honest
tars
whether
my
enemies
discovered
this
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
shortly
after
our
arrival
i
was
sent
for
by
the
captain
into
his
own
cabin
where
i
received
a
lecture
on
my
misconduct
both
as
to
my
supposed
irritable
and
quarrelsome
disposition
and
also
for
losing
the
men
out
of
the
boat
in
other
respects
he
added
your
punishment
would
have
been
much
more
severe
but
for
your
general
good
conduct
and
i
have
no
doubt
from
this
little
severity
that
you
will
in
future
conduct
yourself
with
more
propriety
i
therefore
release
you
from
the
disgraceful
situation
in
which
you
are
placed
and
allow
you
to
return
to
your
duty
on
the
the
tears
which
no
brutality
or
could
wring
from
me
now
flowed
in
abundance
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
i
could
recover
myself
sufficiently
to
thank
him
for
his
kindness
and
to
explain
the
cause
of
my
disgrace
i
told
him
that
since
i
had
joined
the
ship
i
had
been
treated
like
a
dog
that
he
alone
had
been
ignorant
of
it
and
that
he
alone
had
behaved
to
me
with
humanity
i
then
related
all
my
sufferings
from
the
moment
of
that
fatal
glass
of
wine
up
to
the
time
i
was
speaking
i
did
not
conceal
the
act
of
cutting
down
murphy
hammock
nor
of
throwing
the
candlestick
at
his
head
i
assured
him
i
never
gave
any
provocation
that
i
never
struck
without
being
first
stricken
i
said
moreover
that
i
would
never
receive
a
blow
or
be
called
an
improper
name
without
resenting
it
as
far
as
i
was
able
it
was
my
nature
and
if
killed
i
could
not
help
it
several
men
have
run
away
said
i
since
i
came
into
the
ship
and
before
and
the
officers
under
whose
charge
they
were
only
received
a
reprimand
while
i
who
have
just
come
to
sea
have
been
treated
with
the
greatest
and
most
degrading
severity
the
captain
listened
to
my
defence
with
attention
and
i
thought
seemed
very
much
struck
with
it
i
afterwards
learnt
that
mr
handstone
had
received
a
reprimand
for
his
harsh
treatment
of
me
he
observed
that
i
should
one
day
turn
out
a
shining
character
or
go
to
the
devil
it
appeared
pretty
evident
to
me
that
however
i
might
have
roused
the
pride
and
resentment
of
the
senior
members
of
the
mess
by
my
resistance
to
arbitrary
power
that
i
had
gained
some
powerful
friends
among
whom
was
the
captain
many
of
the
officers
admired
that
dogged
do
care
spirit
of
resistance
which
i
so
perseveringly
displayed
and
were
forced
to
admit
that
i
had
right
on
my
side
i
soon
perceived
the
change
of
mind
by
the
frequency
of
invitations
to
the
cabin
and
tables
the
youngsters
were
proud
to
receive
me
again
openly
as
their
associate
but
the
oldsters
regarded
me
with
a
jealousy
and
suspicion
like
that
of
an
unpopular
government
to
a
favourite
radical
leader
i
soon
arranged
with
the
boys
of
my
own
age
a
plan
of
resistance
or
rather
of
which
proved
of
great
importance
in
our
future
warfare
one
or
two
of
them
had
nerve
enough
to
follow
it
up
the
others
made
fair
promises
but
fell
off
in
the
hour
of
trial
my
code
consisted
of
only
two
maxims
the
first
was
always
to
throw
a
bottle
decanter
candlestick
knife
or
fork
at
the
head
of
any
person
who
should
strike
one
of
us
if
the
assailant
should
appear
too
strong
to
encounter
in
fair
fight
the
second
was
never
to
allow
ourselves
to
be
unjustly
defrauded
of
our
rights
to
have
an
equal
share
of
what
we
paid
equally
for
and
to
gain
by
artifice
that
which
was
withheld
by
force
i
explained
to
them
that
by
the
first
plan
we
should
ensure
civility
at
least
for
as
tyrants
are
generally
cowards
they
would
be
afraid
to
provoke
that
anger
which
in
some
unlucky
moment
might
be
fatal
to
them
or
maim
them
for
life
by
the
second
i
promised
to
procure
them
an
equal
share
in
the
good
things
of
this
life
the
greater
part
of
which
the
oldsters
engrossed
to
themselves
in
this
latter
we
were
much
more
unanimous
than
the
former
as
it
incurred
less
personal
risk
i
was
the
projector
of
all
the
schemes
for
forage
and
was
generally
successful
at
length
we
sailed
to
join
the
fleet
off
cadiz
under
the
command
of
lord
nelson
i
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
passage
down
channel
and
across
the
bay
of
biscay
i
was
as
a
lady
in
a
dover
packet
until
inured
to
the
motion
of
the
ship
by
the
merciless
calls
to
my
duties
aloft
or
to
relieve
the
deck
in
my
watch
we
reached
our
station
and
joined
the
immortal
nelson
but
a
few
hours
before
that
battle
in
which
he
lost
his
life
and
saved
his
country
the
history
of
that
important
day
has
been
so
often
and
so
circumstantially
related
that
i
can
not
add
much
more
to
the
stock
on
hand
i
am
only
astonished
seeing
the
confusion
and
of
a
how
so
much
could
be
known
one
observation
occurred
to
me
then
and
i
have
thought
of
it
ever
since
with
redoubled
conviction
this
was
that
the
admiral
after
the
battle
began
was
no
admiral
at
all
he
could
neither
see
nor
be
seen
he
could
take
no
advantage
of
the
enemy
weak
points
or
defend
his
own
his
ship
the
one
of
our
finest
was
in
a
manner
tied
up
alongside
a
french
ship
these
observations
i
have
read
in
some
naval
work
and
in
my
mind
they
receive
ample
confirmation
i
could
not
help
feeling
an
agony
of
anxiety
young
as
i
was
for
my
country
glory
when
i
saw
the
noble
leaders
of
our
two
lines
exposed
to
the
united
fire
of
so
many
ships
i
thought
nelson
was
too
much
exposed
and
think
so
now
experience
has
confirmed
what
youthful
fancy
suggested
the
enemy
centre
should
have
been
by
our
seven
some
of
which
by
being
placed
in
the
rear
had
little
share
in
the
action
and
but
for
the
intimidation
which
their
presence
afforded
might
as
well
have
been
at
spithead
i
mean
no
reflection
on
the
officers
who
had
charge
of
them
accidental
concurrence
of
light
wind
and
station
in
the
line
threw
them
at
such
a
distance
from
the
enemy
as
kept
them
in
the
back
ground
the
greater
part
of
the
day
others
again
were
in
enviable
situations
but
did
not
as
far
as
i
could
learn
from
the
officers
do
quite
so
much
as
they
might
have
done
this
defect
on
our
part
being
met
by
equal
disadvantages
arising
from
nearly
similar
causes
on
that
of
the
enemy
a
clear
victory
remained
to
us
the
aggregate
of
the
british
navy
is
brave
and
good
and
we
must
admit
that
in
this
day
when
england
expected
every
man
to
do
his
duty
there
were
but
few
who
disappointed
their
country
hopes
when
the
immortal
signal
was
communicated
i
shall
never
no
never
forget
the
electric
effect
it
produced
through
the
fleet
i
can
compare
it
to
nothing
so
justly
as
to
a
match
laid
to
a
long
train
of
gunpowder
and
as
englishmen
are
the
same
the
same
feeling
the
same
enthusiasm
was
displayed
in
every
ship
tears
ran
down
the
cheeks
of
many
a
noble
fellow
when
the
affecting
sentence
was
made
known
it
recalled
every
past
enjoyment
and
filled
the
mind
with
fond
anticipations
which
with
many
were
never
alas
to
be
realised
they
went
down
to
their
guns
without
confusion
and
a
cool
deliberate
courage
from
that
moment
seemed
to
rest
on
the
countenance
of
every
man
i
saw
my
captain
though
not
in
the
line
was
no
niggard
in
the
matter
of
shot
and
though
he
had
no
real
business
to
come
within
range
until
called
by
signal
still
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
be
as
near
to
our
ships
engaged
as
possible
in
order
to
afford
them
assistance
when
required
i
was
stationed
at
the
foremost
guns
on
the
main
deck
and
the
ship
cleared
for
action
and
though
on
a
comparatively
small
scale
i
can
not
imagine
a
more
solemn
grand
or
impressive
sight
than
a
ship
prepared
as
ours
was
on
that
occasion
her
noble
tier
of
guns
in
a
line
gently
curving
out
towards
the
centre
the
tackle
laid
across
the
deck
the
shot
and
wads
prepared
in
ample
store
round
grape
and
canister
the
each
with
his
box
full
seated
on
it
with
perfect
apparent
indifference
as
to
the
approaching
conflict
the
captains
of
guns
with
their
priming
boxes
buckled
round
their
waists
the
locks
fixed
upon
the
guns
the
lanyards
laid
around
them
the
officers
with
their
swords
drawn
standing
by
their
respective
divisions
the
was
commanded
by
the
captain
in
person
assisted
by
the
first
lieutenant
the
lieutenant
of
marines
a
party
of
men
with
the
mate
and
midshipmen
and
a
portion
of
seamen
to
attend
the
braces
and
fight
the
guns
the
boatswain
was
on
the
forecastle
the
gunner
in
the
magazine
to
send
up
a
supply
of
powder
to
the
guns
the
carpenter
watched
and
reported
from
time
to
time
the
depth
of
water
in
the
well
he
also
walked
round
the
wings
or
vacant
spaces
between
the
ship
side
and
the
cables
and
other
stores
he
was
attended
by
his
mates
who
were
provided
with
oakum
and
tallow
to
stop
any
which
might
be
made
the
surgeon
was
in
the
cockpit
with
his
assistants
the
knives
saws
tourniquets
sponges
basins
wine
and
water
were
all
displayed
and
ready
for
the
first
unlucky
patient
that
might
be
presented
this
was
more
awful
to
me
than
anything
i
had
seen
how
soon
thought
i
may
i
be
stretched
mangled
and
bleeding
on
this
table
and
have
occasion
for
all
the
skill
and
all
the
instruments
i
now
see
before
me
i
turned
away
and
endeavoured
to
forget
it
all
as
soon
as
the
fleet
bore
up
to
engage
the
enemy
we
did
the
same
keeping
as
near
as
we
could
to
the
admiral
whose
signals
we
were
ordered
to
repeat
i
was
particularly
astonished
with
the
skilful
manner
in
which
this
was
done
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
instantaneously
the
same
flags
were
displayed
at
our
as
had
been
hoisted
by
the
admiral
and
the
more
wonderful
this
appeared
to
me
since
his
flags
were
rolled
up
in
round
balls
which
were
not
broken
loose
until
they
had
reached
the
so
that
the
signal
officers
of
a
repeater
had
to
make
out
the
number
of
the
flag
during
its
passage
aloft
in
disguise
this
was
done
by
the
power
of
good
telescopes
and
from
habit
and
sometimes
by
anticipation
of
the
signal
that
would
be
next
made
the
reader
may
perhaps
not
be
aware
that
among
civilised
nations
in
naval
warfare
ships
of
the
line
never
fire
at
frigates
unless
they
provoke
hostility
by
interposing
between
belligerent
ships
or
firing
into
them
as
was
the
case
in
the
nile
when
sir
james
saumarez
in
the
was
under
the
necessity
of
sinking
the
which
he
did
with
one
broadside
as
a
reward
for
her
temerity
under
this
in
sort
of
compact
we
might
have
come
off
had
we
not
partaken
very
liberally
of
the
shot
intended
for
larger
ships
which
did
serious
damage
among
our
people
the
two
british
lines
running
down
parallel
to
each
other
and
nearly
perpendicular
to
the
crescent
line
of
the
combined
fleets
was
the
grandest
sight
that
was
ever
witnessed
as
soon
as
our
van
was
within
of
the
enemy
they
opened
their
fire
on
the
and
the
but
when
the
of
these
noble
ships
rounded
to
under
the
stern
of
the
and
the
had
very
soon
after
laid
herself
on
board
the
the
clouds
of
smoke
enveloped
both
fleets
and
little
was
to
be
seen
except
the
falling
of
masts
and
here
and
there
as
the
smoke
blew
away
a
ship
totally
dismasted
one
of
these
proved
to
be
english
and
our
captain
seeing
her
between
two
of
the
enemy
bore
up
to
take
her
in
tow
at
the
same
time
one
of
our
ships
of
the
line
opened
a
heavy
fire
on
one
of
the
french
ships
unluckily
situated
in
a
right
line
between
us
so
that
the
shot
which
missed
the
enemy
sometimes
came
on
board
of
us
i
was
looking
out
of
the
bow
port
at
the
moment
that
a
shot
struck
our
ship
on
the
stern
between
wind
and
water
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
the
effect
of
a
heavy
shot
it
made
a
great
splash
and
to
me
as
i
then
thought
a
very
unusual
noise
throwing
a
great
deal
of
water
in
my
face
i
very
naturally
started
back
as
i
believe
many
a
brave
fellow
has
done
two
of
the
seamen
quartered
at
my
guns
laughed
at
me
i
felt
ashamed
and
resolved
to
show
no
more
such
weakness
this
shot
was
very
soon
succeeded
by
some
others
not
quite
so
harmless
one
came
into
the
bow
port
and
killed
the
two
men
who
had
witnessed
my
trepidation
my
pride
having
been
hurt
that
these
men
should
have
seen
me
flinch
i
will
own
that
i
was
secretly
pleased
when
i
saw
them
removed
beyond
the
reach
of
human
interrogation
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
my
feelings
on
this
occasion
not
six
weeks
before
i
was
the
robber
of
and
gardens
the
hero
of
a
ducking
an
usher
now
suddenly
and
almost
without
any
previous
warning
or
reflection
placed
in
the
midst
of
carnage
and
an
actor
of
one
of
those
grand
events
by
which
the
fate
of
the
civilised
world
was
to
be
decided
a
quickened
circulation
of
blood
a
fear
of
immediate
death
and
a
still
greater
fear
of
shame
forced
me
to
an
involuntary
and
frequent
change
of
position
and
it
required
some
time
and
the
best
powers
of
intellect
to
reason
myself
into
that
frame
of
mind
in
which
i
could
feel
as
safe
and
as
unconcerned
as
if
we
had
been
in
harbour
to
this
state
i
at
last
did
attain
and
soon
felt
ashamed
of
the
perturbation
under
which
i
had
laboured
before
the
firing
began
i
prayed
it
is
true
but
my
prayer
was
not
that
of
faith
of
trust
or
of
hope
i
prayed
only
for
safety
from
imminent
personal
danger
and
my
orisons
consisted
of
one
or
two
short
pious
ejaculations
without
a
thought
of
repentance
for
the
past
or
amendment
for
the
future
but
when
we
had
once
got
fairly
into
action
i
felt
no
more
of
this
and
beheld
a
poor
creature
cut
in
two
by
a
shot
with
the
same
indifference
that
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
seen
a
butcher
kill
an
ox
whether
my
heart
was
bad
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
i
certainly
felt
my
curiosity
was
gratified
more
than
my
feelings
were
shocked
when
a
raking
shot
killed
seven
and
wounded
three
more
i
was
sorry
for
the
men
and
for
the
world
would
not
have
injured
them
but
i
had
a
philosophic
turn
of
mind
i
liked
to
judge
of
causes
and
effects
and
i
was
secretly
pleased
at
seeing
the
effect
of
a
raking
shot
towards
four
the
firing
began
to
abate
the
smoke
cleared
away
and
the
calm
sea
became
ruffled
with
an
increasing
breeze
the
two
hostile
fleets
were
quiet
spectators
of
each
other
disasters
we
retained
possession
of
nineteen
or
twenty
sail
of
the
line
some
of
the
enemy
ships
were
seen
running
away
into
cadiz
while
four
others
passed
to
windward
of
our
fleet
and
made
their
escape
a
boat
going
from
our
ship
to
one
near
us
i
jumped
into
her
and
learned
the
death
of
lord
nelson
which
i
communicated
to
the
captain
who
after
paying
a
tribute
to
the
memory
of
that
great
man
looked
at
me
with
much
complacency
i
was
the
only
youngster
that
had
been
particularly
active
and
he
immediately
despatched
me
with
a
message
to
a
ship
at
a
short
distance
the
first
lieutenant
asked
if
he
should
not
send
an
officer
of
more
experience
no
said
the
captain
he
shall
go
the
boy
knows
very
well
what
he
is
about
and
away
i
went
not
a
little
proud
of
the
confidence
placed
in
me
further
details
of
this
eventful
day
are
to
be
found
recorded
in
our
national
histories
it
will
therefore
be
needless
to
repeat
them
here
when
i
met
my
messmates
at
supper
in
the
berth
i
was
sorry
to
see
murphy
among
them
i
had
flattered
myself
that
some
fortunate
shot
would
have
for
ever
divested
me
of
any
further
care
on
his
account
but
his
time
was
not
come
the
devil
has
had
a
fine
haul
said
an
old
master
mate
as
he
took
up
his
glass
of
grog
pity
you
and
some
others
i
could
name
had
not
been
in
the
net
thinks
i
to
myself
i
hope
plenty
of
the
lieutenants
are
bowled
out
said
another
we
shall
stand
some
chance
then
of
a
little
promotion
when
the
hands
were
turned
up
to
muster
the
number
of
killed
amounted
to
nine
and
wounded
to
thirteen
when
this
was
made
known
there
seemed
to
be
a
general
smile
of
congratulation
at
the
number
fallen
rather
than
of
their
regret
for
their
loss
the
vanity
of
the
officers
seemed
tickled
at
the
disproportionate
slaughter
in
a
frigate
of
our
size
as
compared
to
what
they
had
heard
the
ships
of
the
line
had
suffered
i
attended
the
surgeon
in
the
steerage
to
which
place
the
wounded
were
removed
and
saw
all
the
amputations
performed
without
flinching
while
men
who
had
behaved
well
in
the
action
fainted
at
the
sight
i
am
afraid
i
almost
took
a
pleasure
in
observing
the
operations
of
the
surgeon
without
once
reflecting
on
the
pain
suffered
by
the
patient
habit
had
now
begun
to
corrupt
my
mind
i
was
not
cruel
by
nature
i
loved
the
deep
investigation
of
hidden
things
and
this
day
action
gave
me
a
very
clear
insight
into
the
anatomy
of
the
human
frame
which
i
had
seen
cut
in
two
by
shot
lacerated
by
splinters
carved
out
with
knives
and
separated
with
saws
soon
after
the
action
we
were
ordered
to
spithead
with
duplicate
despatches
one
morning
i
heard
a
midshipman
say
he
would
do
his
old
father
out
of
a
new
kit
i
inquired
what
that
meant
was
first
called
a
greenhorn
for
not
knowing
and
then
had
it
explained
to
me
you
know
said
my
instructor
that
after
every
action
there
is
more
canvas
rope
and
paint
expended
in
the
accounts
than
were
destroyed
by
the
enemy
i
assented
to
this
on
the
credit
of
the
informer
without
knowing
whether
it
was
true
or
false
and
he
proceeded
how
are
we
to
have
white
masts
and
all
other
finery
besides
a
coat
of
paint
for
the
ship
sides
every
six
weeks
if
we
do
expend
all
these
things
in
action
and
pretend
they
were
lost
overboard
or
destroyed
the
list
of
defects
are
given
in
to
the
admiral
he
signs
the
demand
and
the
old
commissioner
must
come
down
with
the
stores
whether
he
will
or
not
i
was
once
in
a
sloop
of
war
when
a
large
frigate
ran
on
board
of
us
carried
away
her
and
left
her
large
jib
hanging
on
our
foreyard
it
was
made
of
beautiful
russia
duck
and
to
be
sure
did
we
make
a
gang
of
white
fore
and
aft
besides
white
trousers
for
the
men
well
now
you
must
know
that
as
we
make
suffer
for
the
stores
so
i
mean
to
make
dad
suffer
for
my
traps
i
mean
to
lose
my
chest
overboard
with
all
my
and
return
home
to
him
and
the
old
woman
just
fit
for
the
fashion
and
do
you
really
mean
to
deceive
your
father
and
mother
in
that
way
replied
i
with
much
apparent
innocence
do
i
to
be
sure
i
do
you
flat
how
am
i
to
keep
up
my
stock
if
i
do
make
the
proper
use
of
an
action
like
this
that
we
have
been
in
i
took
the
hint
it
never
once
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
had
fairly
and
candidly
stated
to
my
parents
that
my
stock
of
clothes
were
insufficient
for
my
appearance
as
a
gentleman
on
the
that
they
would
cheerfully
have
increased
it
to
any
reasonable
extent
but
i
had
been
taught
artifice
and
cunning
i
could
tell
the
truth
where
i
thought
it
served
my
purpose
as
well
as
a
lie
but
here
i
thought
deception
was
a
proof
at
once
of
spirit
and
of
merit
and
i
resolved
to
practise
it
if
only
to
raise
myself
a
trifling
degree
in
the
estimation
of
my
unworthy
associates
i
had
become
partial
to
deception
from
habit
and
preferred
exercising
my
own
ingenuity
in
outwitting
my
father
to
obtaining
what
i
needed
by
more
straightforward
and
honourable
measures
the
ship
needed
some
repairs
and
by
the
indulgence
of
the
captain
who
was
pleased
with
my
conduct
i
who
required
so
much
instruction
in
the
nature
and
cause
of
her
defects
was
allowed
to
be
absent
while
they
were
made
good
by
this
oversight
i
lost
all
that
improvement
which
i
should
have
gained
by
close
attention
to
the
unrigging
or
shipping
of
the
ship
the
manner
of
returning
her
stores
taking
out
her
masts
and
ballast
and
seeing
her
taken
into
dock
the
shape
of
her
bottom
and
the
good
or
bad
qualities
which
might
be
supposed
to
accelerate
or
retard
her
movements
all
this
was
sacrificed
to
the
impatience
of
seeing
my
parents
to
the
vainglory
of
boasting
of
the
action
in
which
i
had
been
present
and
perhaps
of
being
encouraged
to
tell
lies
of
things
which
i
never
saw
and
to
talk
of
feats
which
i
never
performed
i
loved
effect
and
i
timed
the
moment
of
my
return
to
my
father
house
through
a
correspondence
with
my
sister
to
be
just
as
a
large
party
had
sat
down
to
a
sumptuous
dinner
i
had
only
been
absent
three
months
it
is
true
but
it
was
my
first
cruise
and
then
i
had
seen
so
much
and
been
in
such
very
interesting
situations
chapter
iv
be
time
to
go
home
what
shall
i
say
i
have
done
it
must
be
a
very
plausive
invention
that
carries
it
i
find
my
tongue
is
too
shakespeare
reaching
the
well
known
mansion
of
my
father
i
knocked
softly
at
the
front
door
was
admitted
and
without
saying
a
word
to
the
servant
rushed
to
the
head
of
the
table
and
threw
my
arms
round
my
mother
neck
who
only
screamed
good
heavens
my
child
and
fell
into
hysterics
my
father
who
was
in
the
very
midst
of
helping
his
soup
jumped
up
to
embrace
me
and
assist
my
mother
the
company
all
rose
like
a
covey
of
partridges
one
lady
spoiled
a
new
pink
satin
gown
by
a
tip
of
the
elbow
from
her
next
neighbour
just
as
a
spoonful
of
soup
had
reached
the
rosy
portals
of
her
mouth
the
little
spaniel
carlo
set
up
a
loud
and
incessant
bark
and
in
one
minute
the
whole
comely
arrangement
of
the
feast
was
converted
into
anarchy
and
confusion
order
was
however
soon
restored
my
mother
recovered
her
composure
my
father
shook
me
by
the
hand
the
company
all
agreed
that
i
was
a
very
fine
interesting
boy
the
ladies
resumed
their
seats
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
observe
that
my
sudden
appearance
had
not
deprived
them
of
their
appetites
i
soon
convinced
them
that
in
this
particular
at
least
i
also
was
in
high
training
my
midshipman
life
had
neither
disqualified
nor
disgusted
me
with
the
luxuries
of
the
table
nor
did
i
manifest
the
slightest
backwardness
or
diffidence
when
invited
by
the
gentlemen
to
take
wine
i
answered
every
question
with
such
fluency
of
speech
and
such
compound
interest
of
words
as
sometimes
caused
the
propounder
to
regret
that
he
had
put
me
to
the
trouble
of
speaking
i
gave
a
very
florid
description
of
the
fight
praised
some
admirals
and
captains
for
their
bravery
sneered
at
others
and
accused
a
few
of
right
down
misconduct
now
and
then
by
way
of
carrying
conviction
into
my
auditors
very
souls
i
rammed
home
my
charges
with
an
oath
at
which
my
father
looked
grave
my
mother
held
up
her
finger
the
gentlemen
laughed
and
the
ladies
all
said
with
a
smile
sweet
boy
what
animation
what
sense
what
discernment
thinks
i
to
myself
you
are
as
complete
a
set
of
gulls
as
ever
picked
up
a
bit
of
biscuit
next
morning
while
my
recent
arrival
was
still
warm
i
broke
the
subject
of
my
chest
to
my
father
and
mother
at
breakfast
indeed
my
father
very
fortunately
for
me
began
by
inquiring
how
my
stock
of
clothes
held
out
bad
enough
said
i
as
i
demolished
the
third
egg
for
i
still
had
a
good
appetite
at
breakfast
bad
enough
repeated
my
father
why
you
were
extremely
well
fitted
with
everything
very
true
sir
said
i
but
then
you
do
know
what
a
is
in
clearing
for
action
everything
not
too
hot
or
too
heavy
is
chucked
overboard
with
as
little
ceremony
as
i
swallow
this
muffin
is
this
spratt
sir
n
mr
spratt
teach
him
to
keep
his
safe
another
time
over
with
it
and
away
it
went
over
the
lee
gangway
spratt
father
was
a
hatter
in
bond
street
so
we
all
laughed
and
pray
frank
said
my
mother
did
your
box
go
in
the
same
way
it
kept
company
i
assure
you
i
watched
them
go
astern
with
tears
in
my
eyes
thinking
how
angry
you
would
be
well
but
the
chest
frank
what
became
of
the
chest
you
said
that
the
vandals
had
some
respect
for
heavy
objects
and
yours
i
am
sure
to
my
cost
had
very
considerable
specific
gravity
that
very
true
sir
but
you
have
no
notion
how
much
it
was
lightened
the
first
day
the
ship
got
to
sea
i
was
lying
on
it
as
sick
as
a
whale
the
first
lieutenant
and
mate
of
the
lower
deck
came
down
to
see
if
the
men
berths
were
clean
i
and
my
noah
ark
lay
slap
in
the
way
have
we
here
said
mr
handstone
mr
mildmay
and
his
chest
sir
said
the
sergeant
of
marines
into
whose
territory
i
acknowledged
i
had
made
very
considerable
incroachments
repeated
the
lieutenant
thought
it
had
been
one
of
the
big
stones
for
the
new
bridge
and
the
owner
of
it
a
drunken
irish
hodman
i
was
too
sick
to
care
much
about
what
they
said
you
forget
your
breakfast
said
my
sister
i
thank
you
for
another
muffin
and
another
cup
of
coffee
said
i
poor
fellow
said
my
mother
what
he
must
have
suffered
oh
i
have
not
told
you
half
yet
my
dear
mother
i
only
wonder
i
am
alive
alive
indeed
said
my
aunt
julia
here
my
dear
here
is
a
small
trifle
to
help
you
to
replenish
the
stock
you
have
lost
in
the
service
of
your
country
noble
little
fellow
what
should
we
do
without
sailors
i
pocketed
the
little
donation
it
was
a
finished
my
breakfast
by
adding
a
slice
of
ham
and
half
a
french
roll
to
the
articles
already
shipped
and
then
continued
my
story
the
first
thing
mr
handstone
said
was
that
my
chest
was
too
big
and
the
next
thing
he
said
was
the
carpenter
i
want
him
here
mr
adze
take
this
chest
reduce
it
one
foot
in
length
and
one
in
height
ay
sir
said
adze
young
gentleman
move
off
and
give
me
your
key
sick
as
i
was
i
knew
remonstrance
or
prayer
were
alike
useless
so
i
crawled
off
and
presented
my
key
to
the
carpenter
who
very
deliberately
unlocked
and
as
expeditiously
unloaded
all
my
treasure
the
midshipmen
all
gathered
round
the
jars
of
preserves
and
the
cakes
of
gingerbread
which
you
my
dearest
mother
had
so
nicely
packed
up
for
me
were
seized
with
greediness
and
devoured
before
my
face
one
of
them
thrust
his
filthy
paw
into
a
pot
of
black
currant
jelly
which
you
gave
me
for
a
sore
throat
and
held
a
handful
of
it
to
my
mouth
knowing
at
the
same
time
that
i
was
ready
to
be
in
his
hand
i
shall
never
bear
the
sight
of
jelly
again
said
my
sister
the
nasty
brutes
said
my
aunt
well
i
resumed
all
my
nice
things
went
and
sick
as
i
was
i
wished
them
gone
but
when
they
laughed
and
spoke
disrespectfully
of
you
my
dear
mother
i
was
ready
to
fly
up
and
tear
their
eyes
out
never
mind
my
dear
boy
said
my
mother
we
will
make
all
right
again
so
i
suppose
we
must
said
my
father
but
no
more
jelly
and
if
you
please
my
dear
proceed
with
your
story
frank
well
sir
in
my
chest
was
ready
for
me
again
but
while
they
were
about
it
they
might
have
taken
off
another
foot
for
i
found
ample
space
to
stow
what
the
plunderers
had
left
the
preserve
jars
being
all
empty
were
given
of
course
to
the
marines
and
some
other
heavy
articles
being
handed
away
i
was
no
longer
puzzled
how
to
stow
them
after
this
you
know
sir
we
had
the
action
and
then
chest
and
bedding
and
all
went
to
the
do
they
throw
all
the
chests
and
bedding
overboard
on
these
occasions
said
my
father
with
a
cool
and
steady
gaze
in
my
face
which
i
had
some
trouble
in
facing
back
again
yes
always
everything
that
is
in
the
way
and
my
chest
was
in
the
way
and
away
it
went
you
know
sir
i
could
not
knock
down
the
first
lieutenant
they
would
have
hanged
me
at
the
thank
heaven
you
did
not
my
love
said
my
mother
what
happened
can
be
repaired
but
could
never
have
been
got
over
and
your
books
what
is
become
of
them
all
went
in
the
lump
they
are
somewhere
near
the
entrance
of
the
gut
of
gibraltar
all
lost
except
my
bible
i
saved
that
as
i
happened
to
be
reading
it
in
my
berth
the
night
before
the
action
excellent
boy
exclaimed
my
mother
and
aunt
both
together
i
am
sure
he
speaks
the
truth
i
hope
he
does
said
my
father
drily
though
it
must
be
owned
that
these
however
glorious
for
old
england
are
very
expensive
amusements
to
the
parents
of
young
midshipmen
unless
the
boys
happen
to
be
knocked
on
the
head
whether
my
father
began
to
smell
a
rat
or
whether
he
was
afraid
of
putting
more
questions
for
fear
of
hearing
more
fibs
i
know
not
but
i
was
not
sorry
when
the
narrative
was
concluded
and
i
dismissed
with
flying
colours
to
my
shame
be
it
spoken
the
bible
that
assisted
me
so
much
in
my
mother
opinion
had
never
but
once
been
opened
since
i
had
left
home
and
that
was
to
examine
if
there
were
any
between
the
leaves
having
heard
of
such
things
being
done
merely
to
try
whether
young
gentlemen
did
search
the
scriptures
my
demands
were
all
made
good
i
believe
with
the
greater
celerity
as
i
began
to
grow
very
tiresome
my
manners
were
not
congenial
to
the
my
mother
aunt
and
sister
were
very
different
from
the
females
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
seeing
on
board
the
frigate
my
oaths
and
treatment
of
the
servants
male
and
female
all
conspired
to
reconcile
the
family
to
my
departure
they
therefore
heard
with
pleasure
that
my
leave
was
expired
and
having
obtained
all
i
wanted
i
did
not
care
one
pin
how
soon
i
got
clear
of
them
so
when
the
coach
came
to
the
door
i
jumped
in
drove
to
the
golden
cross
and
the
next
morning
rejoined
my
ship
i
was
received
with
cheerfulness
and
cordiality
by
most
of
my
shipmates
except
murphy
and
some
of
his
cronies
nor
did
one
feeling
of
regret
or
compunction
enter
my
mind
for
the
lies
and
hypocrisy
with
which
i
had
deceived
and
cheated
my
parents
the
reader
will
probably
be
aware
that
except
the
circumstance
of
reducing
the
size
of
my
chest
and
the
seizure
and
confiscation
of
my
jars
and
gingerbread
there
was
scarcely
a
vestige
of
truth
in
my
story
that
i
had
lost
most
of
my
things
was
most
true
but
they
were
lost
by
my
own
carelessness
and
not
by
being
thrown
overboard
after
losing
the
key
of
my
chest
which
happened
the
day
i
joined
a
rapid
decrease
of
my
stock
convinced
the
first
lieutenant
that
a
much
smaller
package
might
be
made
of
the
remainder
and
this
was
the
sole
cause
of
my
chest
being
converted
into
a
razée
my
fresh
stock
of
clothes
i
brought
down
in
a
trunk
which
i
found
very
handy
and
contrived
to
keep
in
better
order
than
i
had
formerly
done
the
money
given
me
to
procure
more
bedding
i
pocketed
indeed
i
began
to
grow
cunning
i
perceived
that
the
midshipmen
had
always
the
most
pleasant
duties
to
perform
i
was
sent
to
bring
off
parties
of
ladies
who
came
to
visit
the
ship
and
to
dine
with
the
captain
and
officers
i
had
a
tolerably
good
address
and
was
reckoned
a
very
handsome
boy
and
though
stout
of
my
age
the
ladies
admitted
me
to
great
freedom
under
pretence
of
my
being
still
a
dear
little
darling
of
a
middy
and
so
perfectly
innocent
in
my
mind
and
manners
the
fact
is
i
was
kept
in
much
better
order
on
board
my
ship
than
i
was
in
my
father
house
so
much
for
the
habit
of
discipline
but
this
was
all
outside
show
my
father
was
a
man
of
talent
and
knew
the
world
but
he
knew
nothing
of
the
navy
and
when
i
had
got
him
out
of
his
depth
i
served
him
as
i
did
the
usher
that
is
i
soused
him
and
his
company
head
over
heels
in
the
of
their
own
ignorance
such
is
the
power
of
local
knowledge
and
cunning
over
abstruse
science
and
experience
so
much
assurance
had
i
acquired
by
my
recent
success
in
town
that
my
was
increased
to
an
incredible
degree
my
apparent
candour
impudence
and
readiness
gave
a
currency
to
the
coinings
of
my
brain
which
far
surpassed
the
dull
of
my
unwary
contemporaries
of
my
boyish
days
i
have
now
almost
said
enough
the
adventures
of
a
midshipman
during
the
first
three
years
of
his
probationary
life
might
if
fully
detailed
disgust
more
than
amuse
and
corrupt
more
than
they
would
improve
i
therefore
pass
on
to
the
age
of
sixteen
when
my
person
assumed
an
outline
of
which
i
had
great
reason
to
be
proud
since
i
often
heard
it
the
subject
of
encomium
among
the
fair
sex
and
their
award
was
confirmed
even
by
my
companions
my
mind
kept
pace
with
my
person
in
every
acquirement
save
those
of
morality
and
religion
in
these
alas
i
became
daily
more
and
more
deficient
and
for
a
time
lost
sight
of
them
altogether
the
manly
athletic
frame
and
noble
countenance
with
which
i
was
blessed
served
to
render
me
only
more
like
a
painted
sepulchre
all
was
foul
within
like
a
beautiful
snake
whose
poison
is
concealed
under
the
gold
and
azure
of
its
scales
my
inward
man
was
made
up
of
pride
revenge
deceit
and
selfishness
and
my
best
talents
were
generally
applied
to
the
worst
purposes
in
the
knowledge
of
my
profession
i
made
rapid
progress
because
i
delighted
in
it
and
because
my
mind
active
and
elastic
as
my
body
required
and
fed
on
scientific
research
i
soon
became
an
expert
navigator
and
a
good
practical
seaman
and
all
this
i
acquired
by
my
own
application
we
had
no
schoolmaster
and
while
the
other
youngsters
learned
how
to
work
a
common
day
work
from
the
instruction
of
the
older
midshipmen
i
who
was
no
favourite
with
the
latter
was
rejected
from
their
coteries
i
determined
therefore
to
supply
the
deficiency
myself
and
this
i
was
enabled
to
do
by
the
help
of
a
good
education
i
had
been
well
grounded
in
mathematics
and
was
far
advanced
in
euclid
and
algebra
previous
to
leaving
school
thus
i
had
a
vast
superiority
over
my
companions
the
great
difficulty
was
to
renew
my
application
to
study
after
many
months
of
idleness
this
however
i
accomplished
and
after
having
been
one
year
at
sea
kept
a
good
reckoning
and
sent
in
my
day
work
to
the
captain
the
want
of
instruction
which
i
first
felt
in
the
study
of
navigation
proved
in
the
end
of
great
service
to
me
i
was
forced
to
study
more
intensely
and
to
comprehend
the
principles
on
which
i
founded
my
theory
so
that
i
was
prepared
to
prove
by
mathematical
demonstration
what
others
could
only
assert
who
worked
by
inspection
the
pride
of
surpassing
my
seniors
and
the
hope
of
exposing
their
ignorance
stimulated
me
to
inquiry
and
roused
me
to
application
the
books
which
i
had
reported
lost
to
my
father
were
handed
out
from
the
bottom
of
my
chest
and
read
with
avidity
many
others
i
borrowed
from
the
officers
whom
i
must
do
the
justice
to
say
not
only
lent
them
with
cheerfulness
but
offered
me
the
use
of
their
cabin
to
study
in
thus
i
acquired
a
taste
for
reading
i
renewed
my
acquaintance
with
the
classic
authors
horace
and
virgil
licentious
but
alluring
drove
me
back
to
the
study
of
latin
and
fixed
in
my
mind
a
knowledge
of
the
dead
languages
at
the
expense
of
my
morals
whether
the
exchange
were
profitable
or
not
is
left
to
wiser
heads
than
mine
to
decide
my
business
is
with
facts
only
thus
while
the
ungenerous
malice
of
the
elder
midshipmen
thought
to
have
injured
me
by
leaving
me
in
ignorance
they
did
me
the
greatest
possible
service
by
throwing
me
on
my
own
resources
i
continued
on
pretty
nearly
the
same
terms
with
my
shipmates
to
the
last
with
some
of
the
officers
i
was
still
in
disgrace
and
was
always
disliked
by
the
oldsters
in
my
own
mess
with
the
younger
midshipmen
and
the
foremast
men
i
was
a
favourite
i
was
too
proud
to
be
a
tyrant
and
the
same
feeling
prevented
my
submitting
to
tyranny
as
i
increased
in
strength
and
stature
i
showed
more
determined
resistance
to
arbitrary
power
an
occasional
with
boys
of
my
own
size
for
the
best
friends
will
quarrel
and
the
supernumerary
midshipmen
sent
on
board
for
a
passage
generally
ended
in
establishing
my
dominion
or
insuring
for
me
a
peaceable
neutrality
i
became
a
scientific
pugilist
and
now
and
then
took
a
brush
with
an
oldster
and
although
overpowered
yet
i
displayed
so
much
prowess
that
my
enemies
became
cautious
how
they
renewed
a
struggle
which
they
perceived
became
daily
more
arduous
till
at
last
like
the
whelp
my
play
ceased
to
be
a
joke
and
i
was
left
to
enjoy
that
tranquillity
which
few
found
it
safe
or
convenient
to
disturb
by
degrees
the
balance
of
power
was
fairly
established
and
even
murphy
was
awed
into
civil
silence
in
addition
to
my
well
known
increase
in
personal
strength
i
acquired
a
still
greater
superiority
over
my
companions
by
the
advantage
of
education
and
this
i
took
great
care
to
make
them
feel
on
every
occasion
i
was
appealed
to
in
all
cases
of
literary
disputation
and
was
by
general
consent
the
umpire
of
the
steerage
i
was
termed
good
company
not
always
to
the
advantage
of
the
possessor
of
such
a
talent
for
it
often
tends
as
it
did
with
me
to
lead
into
very
bad
company
i
had
a
fine
voice
and
played
on
one
or
two
instruments
this
frequently
procured
me
invitations
to
the
and
excuses
from
duty
together
with
more
wine
or
grog
than
was
of
service
to
me
and
conversation
that
i
had
better
not
have
heard
we
were
ordered
on
a
cruise
to
the
coast
of
france
and
as
the
junior
had
a
spite
against
our
captain
he
swore
by
that
go
we
should
ready
or
not
ready
our
signal
was
made
to
weigh
while
lighters
of
provisions
and
the
with
our
powder
were
lying
alongside
the
guns
all
adrift
and
not
even
mounted
gun
after
gun
from
the
was
repeated
by
the
the
of
the
and
with
our
signal
to
part
company
the
captain
not
knowing
how
the
story
might
travel
up
by
telegraph
to
london
and
conscious
perhaps
that
he
had
left
a
little
too
much
to
the
first
lieutenant
tore
the
ship
away
by
the
hair
of
the
head
unmoored
bundled
everything
in
upon
deck
out
of
the
lighters
turned
all
the
women
out
of
the
ship
except
five
or
six
of
the
most
abandoned
and
with
a
strong
northerly
wind
ran
down
to
yarmouth
roads
and
through
the
needles
to
sea
in
a
state
of
confusion
and
disaster
which
i
hope
never
to
see
again
the
sir
hurricane
humbug
stood
on
the
platform
looking
at
us
i
was
afterwards
told
and
was
heard
to
exclaim
d
n
his
eyes
meaning
our
captain
there
he
goes
at
last
i
was
afraid
that
that
fellow
would
have
grounded
on
his
beef
bones
before
we
should
have
got
him
out
the
more
haste
the
less
speed
is
oftener
true
in
naval
affairs
than
in
any
other
situation
of
life
with
us
it
had
nearly
proved
fatal
to
the
ship
had
we
met
with
an
enemy
we
must
either
have
disgraced
the
flag
by
running
away
or
been
taken
no
sooner
clear
of
the
needles
than
night
came
on
and
with
it
a
heavy
gale
of
wind
at
the
officers
and
men
were
at
work
till
four
in
the
morning
securing
the
boats
booms
and
anchors
clearing
the
decks
of
provisions
and
setting
up
the
lower
rigging
which
by
the
labour
of
the
ship
had
begun
to
stretch
to
an
alarming
degree
by
great
exertion
this
was
accomplished
and
the
guns
secured
before
the
gale
had
increased
to
a
hurricane
about
nine
the
next
morning
a
poor
marine
a
recruit
from
portsmouth
unfortunately
fell
overboard
and
though
many
brave
fellows
instantly
jumped
into
one
of
the
and
begged
to
be
lowered
down
to
save
him
the
captain
who
was
a
cool
calculator
thought
the
chance
of
losing
seven
men
was
greater
than
that
of
saving
one
so
the
poor
fellow
was
left
to
his
fate
the
ship
it
is
true
was
hove
to
but
she
drifted
to
leeward
much
faster
than
the
unfortunate
man
could
swim
though
he
was
one
of
the
best
swimmers
i
ever
beheld
it
was
to
see
the
manly
but
ineffectual
exertions
made
by
this
gallant
youth
to
regain
the
ship
but
all
his
powers
only
served
to
prolong
his
misery
we
saw
him
nearly
a
mile
to
windward
at
one
moment
riding
on
the
top
of
the
mountainous
wave
at
the
next
sinking
into
the
deep
valley
between
till
at
last
we
saw
him
no
more
his
sad
fate
was
long
deplored
in
the
ship
i
thought
at
the
time
that
the
captain
was
cruel
in
not
sending
a
boat
for
him
but
i
am
now
convinced
from
experience
that
he
submitted
only
to
hard
necessity
and
chose
the
lesser
evil
of
the
two
the
fate
of
this
young
man
was
a
serious
warning
to
me
i
had
become
from
habit
so
extremely
active
and
fond
of
displaying
my
gymnastics
called
by
the
sailors
that
my
speedy
exit
was
often
prognosticated
by
the
old
and
even
by
the
officers
it
was
clearly
understood
that
i
was
either
to
be
drowned
or
was
to
break
my
neck
for
the
latter
i
took
my
chance
pretty
fairly
going
up
and
down
the
rigging
like
a
monkey
few
of
the
topmen
could
equal
me
in
speed
still
fewer
surpass
me
in
feats
of
daring
activity
i
could
run
along
the
topsail
yards
out
to
the
go
from
one
mast
to
the
other
by
the
stays
or
down
on
deck
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
by
the
topsail
halyards
and
as
i
knew
myself
to
be
an
expert
swimmer
i
cared
little
about
the
chance
of
being
drowned
but
when
i
witnessed
the
fate
of
the
poor
marine
who
i
saw
could
swim
as
well
if
not
better
than
myself
i
became
much
more
cautious
i
perceived
that
there
might
be
situations
in
which
swimming
could
be
of
no
use
and
however
beloved
i
might
have
been
by
the
sailors
it
was
evident
that
even
if
they
had
the
inclination
they
might
not
always
have
the
power
to
relieve
me
from
this
time
i
became
much
more
guarded
in
my
movements
aloft
a
circumstance
occurred
shortly
after
we
got
to
sea
which
afforded
me
infinite
satisfaction
murphy
whose
disposition
led
him
to
bully
every
one
whom
he
thought
he
could
master
fixed
a
quarrel
on
a
very
quiet
gentlemanly
young
man
a
supernumerary
midshipman
who
had
come
on
board
for
a
passage
to
his
own
ship
then
down
in
the
bay
of
biscay
the
young
man
resenting
this
improper
behaviour
challenged
murphy
to
fight
and
the
challenge
was
accepted
but
as
the
supernumerary
was
engaged
to
dine
with
the
captain
he
proposed
that
the
meeting
should
not
take
place
till
after
dinner
not
wishing
to
exhibit
a
black
eye
at
the
captain
table
this
was
considered
by
murphy
as
an
evasion
and
he
added
further
insult
by
saying
that
he
supposed
his
antagonist
wanted
dutch
courage
and
that
if
he
did
not
get
wine
enough
in
the
cabin
he
would
not
fight
at
all
the
youth
made
no
reply
to
this
insolence
but
having
dressed
himself
went
up
to
dinner
that
over
and
after
the
muster
at
quarters
he
called
mr
murphy
into
the
steerage
and
gave
him
as
sound
a
drubbing
as
he
ever
received
in
his
life
the
fight
or
lasted
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
the
young
supernumerary
displayed
so
much
science
and
such
a
thorough
use
of
his
fists
as
to
defy
the
brutal
force
of
his
opponent
who
could
not
touch
him
and
who
was
glad
to
retreat
to
his
berth
followed
by
the
groans
and
hisses
of
all
the
midshipmen
in
which
i
most
cordially
joined
after
so
clear
a
proof
of
the
advantages
of
the
science
of
i
determined
to
acquire
it
and
with
the
young
stranger
for
my
tutor
i
soon
became
a
proficient
in
the
art
of
boxing
and
able
to
cope
with
murphy
and
his
supporters
there
was
a
part
of
my
duty
which
i
am
free
to
confess
i
hated
this
was
keeping
watch
at
night
i
loved
sleep
and
after
ten
i
could
not
keep
my
eyes
open
neither
the
buckets
of
water
which
were
so
liberally
poured
over
me
by
the
midshipmen
under
the
facetious
appellation
of
blowing
the
grampus
nor
any
expostulation
or
punishments
inflicted
on
me
by
the
first
lieutenant
could
rouse
my
energies
after
the
first
half
of
the
watch
was
expired
i
was
one
of
the
most
determined
votaries
of
somnus
and
for
his
sake
endured
every
sort
of
persecution
the
first
lieutenant
took
me
into
his
watch
and
tried
every
means
both
of
mildness
and
coercion
to
break
me
of
this
evil
habit
i
was
sure
however
to
escape
from
him
and
to
conceal
myself
in
some
hole
or
corner
where
i
slept
out
the
remainder
of
the
watch
and
the
next
morning
i
was
as
regularly
to
do
penance
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
for
my
deeds
of
darkness
i
believe
that
of
the
first
two
years
of
my
servitude
of
my
waking
hours
at
least
were
passed
aloft
i
took
care
however
to
provide
myself
with
books
and
on
the
whole
was
perhaps
better
employed
than
i
should
have
been
in
my
berth
below
handstone
though
a
martinet
was
a
gentleman
and
as
he
felt
a
great
interest
in
the
young
officers
in
the
ship
so
he
took
much
pains
in
the
instruction
and
improvement
of
them
he
frequently
expostulated
with
me
on
the
great
impropriety
of
my
conduct
my
answer
invariably
was
that
i
was
as
sensible
of
it
as
he
could
be
but
that
i
could
not
help
it
that
i
deserved
all
the
punishment
i
met
with
and
threw
myself
entirely
on
his
mercy
he
used
frequently
to
call
me
over
to
the
weather
side
of
the
deck
when
he
would
converse
with
me
on
any
topic
which
he
thought
might
interest
or
amuse
me
finding
i
was
tolerably
well
read
in
history
he
asked
my
opinion
and
gave
me
his
own
with
great
good
sense
and
judgment
but
such
was
the
irresistible
weight
of
my
eyelids
that
i
used
when
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
long
dissertation
to
slip
down
the
and
leave
him
to
finish
his
discourses
to
the
wind
now
when
this
occurred
i
was
more
severely
punished
than
on
any
other
occasion
for
to
the
neglect
of
duty
i
added
contempt
both
of
his
rank
and
the
instruction
he
was
offering
to
me
his
wrath
was
also
considerably
increased
when
he
only
discovered
my
departure
by
the
tittering
of
the
other
midshipmen
and
the
at
the
one
evening
i
completed
my
disgrace
with
him
though
a
great
deal
might
be
said
in
my
own
favour
he
had
sent
me
to
the
head
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
very
unfeelingly
or
forgetfully
kept
me
there
the
whole
day
when
he
went
off
deck
to
his
dinner
i
came
down
into
the
top
made
a
bed
for
myself
in
one
of
the
studding
sails
and
desiring
the
man
who
had
the
to
call
me
before
the
lieutenant
was
likely
to
come
on
deck
i
very
quietly
began
to
prepare
a
sacrifice
to
my
favourite
deity
somnus
but
as
the
man
did
not
see
the
lieutenant
come
up
i
was
caught
napping
just
at
dusk
when
the
lieutenant
came
on
deck
and
did
me
the
honour
to
remember
where
he
had
left
me
looking
at
the
head
he
called
me
down
like
milton
devils
who
were
found
sleeping
by
one
they
dread
up
i
sprung
and
regained
my
perch
by
the
supposing
or
rather
hoping
that
he
would
not
see
me
before
the
mast
in
the
obscurity
of
the
evening
but
he
was
too
and
had
not
presence
of
mind
enough
to
see
what
he
should
not
have
seen
he
called
to
the
three
men
in
the
top
and
inquired
where
i
was
they
replied
at
the
what
exclaimed
handstone
with
an
oath
did
i
not
see
him
this
moment
go
up
by
the
no
sir
said
the
men
he
is
now
asleep
at
the
come
down
here
you
lying
rascals
every
one
of
you
said
the
lieutenant
and
i
teach
you
to
speak
the
truth
i
who
had
by
this
time
quietly
resumed
my
station
was
ordered
down
along
with
them
and
we
all
four
stood
on
the
while
the
following
interrogations
were
put
to
us
now
sir
said
the
first
lieutenant
to
the
captain
of
the
top
how
dare
you
tell
me
that
that
young
gentleman
was
at
the
when
i
myself
saw
him
up
by
the
i
was
sorry
for
the
men
who
to
save
me
had
got
themselves
into
jeopardy
and
i
was
just
going
to
declare
the
truth
and
take
the
whole
odium
upon
myself
when
to
my
utter
astonishment
the
man
boldly
answered
he
at
the
sir
upon
my
honour
your
honour
cried
the
lieutenant
with
contempt
then
turning
to
the
other
men
he
put
the
same
question
to
them
both
in
succession
and
received
the
same
positive
answers
so
that
i
really
began
to
think
i
had
been
at
the
all
the
time
and
had
been
dreaming
i
was
in
the
top
at
last
turning
to
me
he
said
now
sir
i
ask
you
on
your
honour
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
where
were
you
when
i
first
hailed
at
the
sir
said
i
be
it
so
he
replied
as
you
are
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
i
am
bound
to
believe
you
then
turning
on
his
heels
he
walked
away
in
a
greater
rage
than
i
ever
remember
to
have
seen
him
i
plainly
perceived
that
i
was
not
believed
and
that
i
had
lost
his
good
opinion
yet
to
consider
the
case
fairly
and
impartially
how
could
i
have
acted
otherwise
i
had
been
much
too
long
confined
to
the
as
long
as
a
man
might
take
to
go
from
london
to
bath
in
a
stagecoach
i
had
lost
all
my
meals
and
these
poor
fellows
to
save
me
from
further
punishment
had
voluntarily
exposed
themselves
to
a
flogging
at
the
gangway
by
telling
a
barefaced
falsehood
in
my
defence
had
i
not
supported
them
they
would
certainly
have
been
flogged
and
i
should
have
lost
myself
with
every
person
aboard
i
therefore
came
to
that
paradoxical
conclusion
on
the
spot
namely
that
as
a
man
of
honour
and
a
gentleman
i
was
bound
to
tell
a
lie
in
order
to
save
these
poor
men
from
a
cruel
punishment
i
am
sensible
that
this
is
a
case
to
lay
before
the
bench
of
bishops
and
though
i
never
pretended
to
the
constancy
of
a
martyr
had
the
consequences
been
on
myself
alone
i
should
have
had
no
hesitation
in
speaking
the
truth
the
lieutenant
was
to
blame
first
by
too
great
a
severity
and
secondly
by
too
rigid
an
inquiry
into
a
subject
not
worth
the
trouble
still
my
conscience
smote
me
that
i
had
done
wrong
and
when
the
rage
of
the
lieutenant
had
abated
so
as
to
insure
the
impunity
of
the
men
i
took
the
earliest
opportunity
of
explaining
to
him
the
motives
for
my
conduct
and
the
painful
situation
in
which
i
stood
he
received
my
excuses
coldly
and
we
never
were
friends
again
our
captain
who
was
a
dashing
sort
of
a
fellow
contrived
to
brush
up
the
enemy
quarters
on
the
coast
of
france
on
one
of
our
boat
expeditions
i
contrived
to
slip
away
with
the
rest
we
landed
and
surprised
a
battery
which
we
blew
up
and
spiked
the
guns
the
french
soldiers
ran
for
their
lives
and
we
plundered
the
huts
of
some
poor
fishermen
i
went
in
with
the
rest
in
hopes
of
finding
plunder
and
for
my
deserts
caught
a
tartar
a
large
skait
lay
with
its
mouth
open
into
which
i
thrust
my
to
drag
him
away
the
animal
was
not
dead
and
closing
his
jaws
divided
my
finger
to
the
bone
this
was
the
only
blood
spilt
on
the
occasion
though
guilty
myself
i
was
sorry
to
see
the
love
of
plunder
prevail
so
extensively
among
us
the
sailors
took
away
articles
utterly
useless
to
them
and
after
carrying
them
a
certain
distance
threw
them
down
for
others
equally
useless
i
have
since
often
reflected
how
justly
i
was
punished
for
my
fault
and
how
needlessly
we
inflicted
the
horrors
of
war
on
those
inoffensive
and
unhappy
creatures
our
next
attempt
was
of
a
more
serious
nature
and
productive
of
still
greater
calamity
to
the
unoffending
and
industrious
the
usual
victims
of
war
while
the
instigators
are
reposing
in
safety
on
their
down
beds

danger
like
an
ague
subtly
taints
even
then
when
we
sit
idly
in
the
sun
troilus
and
cressida
i
had
never
been
able
to
regain
the
confidence
and
esteem
of
the
first
lieutenant
since
the
unfortunate
affair
of
the
he
was
certainly
an
excellent
and
a
correct
officer
too
much
so
to
overlook
what
he
considered
a
breach
of
honour
i
therefore
easily
reconciled
myself
to
a
separation
which
occurred
very
soon
after
we
chased
a
ship
into
the
bay
of
arcasson
when
as
was
customary
she
sought
safety
under
a
battery
and
the
captain
according
to
our
custom
resolved
to
cut
her
out
for
this
purpose
the
boats
were
manned
and
armed
and
every
preparation
made
for
the
attack
on
the
following
morning
the
command
of
the
expedition
was
given
to
the
first
lieutenant
who
accepted
of
it
with
cheerfulness
and
retired
to
his
bed
in
high
spirits
with
the
anticipation
of
the
honour
and
profit
which
the
dawn
of
day
would
heap
upon
him
he
was
proverbially
brave
and
cool
in
action
so
that
the
seamen
followed
him
with
confidence
as
to
certain
victory
whether
any
dreams
had
disturbed
his
rest
or
whether
any
reflections
on
the
difficult
and
dangerous
nature
of
the
service
had
alarmed
him
i
could
not
tell
but
in
the
morning
we
all
observed
a
remarkable
change
in
his
deportment
his
ardour
was
gone
he
walked
the
deck
with
a
slow
and
measured
pace
apparently
in
deep
thought
and
contrary
to
his
usual
manner
was
silent
and
melancholy
abstracted
and
inattentive
to
the
duties
of
the
ship
the
boats
prepared
for
the
service
were
manned
the
officers
had
taken
their
seats
in
them
the
oars
were
tossed
up
the
eyes
of
the
young
warriors
beamed
with
animation
and
we
waited
for
mr
handstone
who
still
walked
the
deck
absorbed
in
his
own
reflections
he
was
at
length
recalled
to
a
sense
of
his
situation
by
the
captain
who
in
a
tone
of
voice
more
than
usually
loud
asked
him
if
he
intended
to
take
the
command
of
the
expedition
he
replied
most
certainly
and
with
a
firm
and
animated
step
crossed
the
and
went
into
his
boat
i
following
seated
myself
by
his
side
he
looked
at
me
with
a
foreboding
indifference
had
he
been
in
his
usual
mood
he
would
have
sent
me
to
some
other
boat
we
had
a
long
pull
before
we
reached
the
object
of
our
intended
attack
which
we
found
moored
close
in
shore
and
well
prepared
for
us
a
broadside
of
was
the
first
salute
we
received
it
produced
the
same
effect
on
our
men
as
the
spur
to
a
fiery
steed
we
pulled
alongside
and
began
to
scramble
up
in
the
best
manner
we
could
handstone
in
an
instant
regained
all
his
wonted
animation
cheered
his
men
and
with
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
mounted
the
ship
side
while
our
men
at
the
same
time
poured
in
volleys
of
musketry
and
then
followed
their
intrepid
leader
in
our
boat
the
first
alongside
eleven
men
out
of
lay
killed
or
disabled
disregarding
these
the
lieutenant
sprang
up
i
followed
close
to
him
he
leaped
from
the
bulwark
in
upon
her
deck
and
before
i
could
lift
my
cutlass
in
his
defence
fell
back
upon
me
knocked
me
down
in
his
fall
and
expired
in
a
moment
he
had
thirteen
in
his
chest
and
stomach
i
had
no
time
to
disengage
myself
before
i
was
trampled
on
and
nearly
suffocated
by
the
pressure
of
my
shipmates
who
burning
to
gain
the
prize
or
to
avenge
our
fall
rushed
on
with
the
most
undaunted
bravery
i
was
supposed
to
be
dead
and
treated
accordingly
my
poor
body
being
only
used
as
a
stop
for
the
gangway
where
the
ladder
was
unshipped
there
i
lay
fainting
with
the
pressure
and
nearly
suffocated
with
the
blood
of
my
brave
leader
on
whose
breast
my
face
rested
with
my
hands
crossed
over
the
back
of
my
head
to
save
my
skull
if
possible
from
the
heels
of
my
friends
and
the
swords
of
my
enemies
and
while
reason
held
her
seat
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
i
was
just
as
well
where
i
was
and
that
a
change
of
position
might
not
be
for
the
better
about
eight
minutes
decided
the
affair
though
it
certainly
did
seem
to
me
in
my
then
unpleasant
situation
much
longer
before
it
was
over
i
had
fainted
and
before
i
regained
my
senses
the
vessel
was
under
weigh
and
out
of
gunshot
from
the
batteries
the
first
moments
of
respite
from
carnage
were
employed
in
examining
the
bodies
of
the
killed
and
wounded
i
was
numbered
among
the
former
and
stretched
out
between
the
guns
by
the
side
of
the
first
lieutenant
and
the
other
dead
bodies
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
through
the
ports
revived
me
a
little
but
faint
and
sick
i
had
neither
the
power
nor
inclination
to
move
my
brain
was
confused
i
had
no
recollection
of
what
had
happened
and
continued
to
lie
in
a
sort
of
stupor
until
the
prize
came
alongside
of
the
frigate
and
i
was
roused
by
the
cheers
of
congratulation
and
victory
from
those
who
had
remained
on
board
a
boat
instantly
brought
the
surgeon
and
his
assistants
to
inspect
the
dead
and
assist
the
living
murphy
came
along
with
them
he
had
not
been
of
the
boarding
party
and
seeing
my
supposed
lifeless
corpse
he
gave
it
a
slight
kick
saying
at
the
same
time
here
is
a
young
cock
that
has
done
crowing
well
for
a
wonder
this
chap
has
cheated
the
gallows
the
sound
of
the
fellow
detested
voice
was
enough
to
recall
me
from
the
grave
if
my
orders
had
been
signed
i
faintly
exclaimed
you
are
a
liar
which
even
with
all
the
melancholy
scene
around
us
produced
a
burst
of
laughter
at
his
expense
i
was
removed
to
the
ship
put
to
bed
and
bled
and
was
soon
able
to
narrate
the
particulars
of
my
adventure
but
i
continued
a
long
while
dangerously
ill
the
soliloquy
of
murphy
over
my
supposed
dead
body
and
my
laconic
reply
were
the
cause
of
much
merriment
in
the
ship
the
midshipmen
annoyed
him
by
asserting
that
he
had
saved
my
life
as
nothing
but
his
hated
voice
could
have
awoke
me
from
my
sleep
of
death
the
fate
of
the
first
lieutenant
was
justly
deplored
by
all
of
us
though
i
can
not
deny
my
acquiescence
in
the
will
of
providence
in
this
as
well
as
on
a
former
occasion
when
the
witnesses
of
my
weakness
had
been
removed
for
ever
out
of
my
way
as
i
saw
it
was
impossible
to
regain
his
good
opinion
i
thought
it
was
quite
as
well
that
we
should
part
company
that
he
had
a
strong
presentiment
of
his
death
was
proved
and
though
i
had
often
heard
these
instances
asserted
i
never
before
had
it
so
clearly
brought
home
to
my
senses
the
prize
was
called
laden
with
coffee
cotton
and
indigo
mounted
fourteen
guns
had
at
the
commencement
of
the
action
men
of
whom
eight
were
killed
and
sixteen
wounded
the
period
of
our
return
into
port
according
to
our
orders
happened
to
coincide
with
this
piece
of
good
fortune
and
we
came
up
to
spithead
where
our
captain
met
with
a
hearty
welcome
from
the
admiral
having
delivered
his
butcher
bill
the
list
of
killed
and
wounded
together
with
an
account
of
our
defects
they
were
sent
up
to
the
admiralty
and
by
return
of
post
we
were
ordered
to
fit
foreign
and
although
no
one
on
board
not
even
the
captain
was
supposed
to
know
our
destination
the
girls
on
the
point
assured
us
it
was
the
mediterranean
and
this
turned
out
to
be
the
fact
a
few
days
only
were
spent
in
hurried
preparation
during
which
i
continued
to
write
to
my
father
and
mother
in
return
i
received
all
i
required
which
was
a
remittance
in
cash
this
i
duly
acknowledged
by
a
few
lines
as
the
ship
was
unmooring
we
sailed
and
soon
after
arrived
without
accident
at
gibraltar
where
we
found
general
orders
for
any
ship
that
might
arrive
from
england
to
proceed
and
join
the
admiral
at
malta
in
a
few
hours
our
provisions
and
water
were
complete
but
we
were
not
in
so
much
haste
to
arrive
at
malta
as
we
were
to
quit
gibraltar
hugging
the
spanish
coast
in
hopes
of
picking
up
something
to
insure
us
as
hearty
a
welcome
at
valette
as
we
found
on
our
last
return
to
portsmouth
early
on
the
second
morning
of
our
departure
we
made
cape
de
gaete
as
the
day
dawned
we
discovered
four
sail
in
the
wind
eye
and
close
in
shore
the
wind
was
light
and
all
sail
was
made
in
chase
we
gained
very
little
on
them
for
many
hours
and
towards
evening
it
fell
calm
the
boats
were
then
ordered
to
pursue
them
and
we
set
off
diverging
a
little
from
each
other
course
or
as
the
french
would
say
to
give
a
better
chance
of
falling
in
with
them
i
was
in
the
gig
with
the
master
and
that
being
the
best
running
boat
we
soon
came
up
with
one
of
the
feluccas
we
fired
musketry
at
her
but
having
a
light
breeze
she
would
not
we
then
took
good
aim
at
the
helmsman
and
hit
him
the
man
only
shifted
the
helm
from
his
right
hand
to
his
left
and
kept
on
his
course
we
still
kept
firing
at
this
intrepid
fellow
and
i
felt
it
was
like
wilful
murder
since
he
made
no
resistance
but
steadily
endeavoured
to
escape
at
length
we
got
close
under
the
stern
and
hooked
on
with
our
this
the
spaniards
unhooked
and
we
dropped
astern
having
laid
our
oars
in
but
the
breeze
dying
entirely
away
we
again
pulled
up
alongside
and
took
possession
the
poor
man
was
still
at
the
helm
bleeding
profusely
we
offered
him
every
assistance
and
asked
why
he
did
not
surrender
sooner
he
replied
that
he
was
an
old
castilian
whether
he
meant
that
an
earlier
surrender
would
have
disgraced
him
or
that
he
contemplated
from
his
former
experience
a
chance
of
escape
to
the
last
moment
i
can
not
tell
certain
it
is
that
no
one
ever
behaved
better
and
i
felt
that
i
would
have
given
all
i
possessed
to
have
healed
the
wounds
of
this
patient
meek
and
undaunted
old
man
who
uttered
no
complaint
but
submitted
to
his
fate
with
a
magnanimity
which
would
have
done
credit
to
socrates
himself
he
had
received
four
in
his
body
and
of
course
survived
his
capture
but
a
very
few
hours
we
found
to
our
surprise
that
this
vessel
with
the
three
others
one
of
which
was
taken
by
another
of
our
boats
were
from
lima
they
were
about
thirty
tons
burthen
twelve
men
each
and
were
laden
with
copper
hides
wax
and
cochineal
and
had
been
out
five
months
they
were
bound
to
valentia
from
which
they
were
only
one
day
sail
when
we
intercepted
them
such
is
the
fortune
of
war
this
gallant
man
after
a
voyage
of
incredible
labour
and
difficulty
would
in
a
few
hours
have
embraced
his
family
and
gladdened
their
hearts
with
the
produce
of
honest
industry
and
successful
enterprise
when
in
a
moment
all
their
hopes
were
blasted
by
our
legal
murder
and
robbery
and
our
came
to
our
pockets
with
the
tears
if
not
the
curses
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
from
some
information
which
the
captain
obtained
in
the
prize
he
was
induced
to
stand
over
towards
the
balearic
islands
we
made
ivica
and
stood
past
it
then
ran
for
palma
bay
in
the
island
of
majorca
here
we
found
nothing
to
our
great
disappointment
and
continued
our
course
round
the
island
an
event
occurred
here
so
singular
as
scarcely
to
be
credible
but
the
fact
is
well
attested
as
there
were
others
who
witnessed
it
beside
myself
the
water
was
smooth
and
the
day
remarkably
fine
we
were
distant
from
the
shore
more
than
a
mile
and
a
quarter
when
the
captain
wishing
to
try
the
range
of
the
guns
which
were
long
ordered
the
gunner
to
elevate
one
of
them
and
fire
it
towards
the
land
the
gunner
asked
whether
he
should
point
the
gun
at
any
object
a
man
was
seen
walking
on
the
white
sandy
beach
and
as
there
did
not
appear
to
be
the
slightest
chance
of
hitting
him
for
he
only
looked
like
a
speck
the
captain
desired
the
gunner
to
fire
at
him
he
did
so
and
the
man
fell
a
herd
of
bullocks
at
this
moment
was
seen
coming
out
of
the
woods
and
the
boats
were
sent
with
a
party
to
shoot
some
of
them
for
the
ship
company
when
we
landed
we
found
that
the
ball
had
cut
the
poor
man
in
two
and
what
made
the
circumstance
more
particularly
interesting
was
that
he
was
evidently
a
man
of
consequence
he
was
well
dressed
had
on
black
breeches
and
silk
stockings
he
was
reading
ovid
metamorphoses
and
still
grasped
the
book
which
i
took
out
of
his
hand
we
have
often
heard
of
the
miraculous
powers
ascribed
to
a
chance
shot
but
never
could
we
have
supposed
that
this
devilish
ball
could
have
gone
so
far
or
done
so
much
mischief
we
buried
the
remains
of
the
unfortunate
gentleman
in
the
sand
and
having
selected
two
or
three
bullocks
out
of
the
herd
shot
them
skinned
and
divided
them
into
quarters
loaded
our
boat
and
returned
on
board
i
had
taken
the
book
out
of
the
hand
of
the
deceased
and
from
his
neck
a
small
miniature
of
a
beautiful
female
the
brooch
in
his
shirt
i
also
brought
away
and
when
i
gave
an
account
to
the
captain
of
what
had
happened
i
offered
him
these
articles
he
returned
them
all
to
me
desired
me
to
keep
them
until
i
could
see
any
of
the
friends
of
the
deceased
and
appeared
so
much
distressed
at
the
accident
that
we
never
mentioned
it
afterwards
and
in
the
course
of
the
time
we
were
together
it
was
nearly
forgotten
the
articles
remained
in
my
possession
unnoticed
for
many
years
two
days
after
we
fell
in
with
a
vessel
of
suspicious
appearance
and
it
being
calm
the
boats
were
sent
in
chase
they
found
her
on
their
approach
to
be
a
xebeque
under
french
colours
but
these
they
very
soon
hauled
down
and
showed
no
others
as
we
came
within
hail
they
told
us
to
keep
off
and
that
if
we
attempted
to
board
they
should
fire
into
us
this
was
not
a
threat
likely
to
deter
a
british
officer
and
particularly
such
as
ours
so
to
it
we
went
and
a
desperate
struggle
ensued
the
numbers
being
nearly
equal
on
both
sides
but
they
had
the
advantage
of
their
own
deck
and
bulwarks
we
got
on
board
however
and
in
a
few
minutes
gained
possession
with
a
loss
on
our
side
of
sixteen
and
on
that
of
our
opponent
of
killed
and
wounded
but
great
was
our
sorrow
and
disappointment
when
we
discovered
that
we
had
shed
the
blood
of
our
friends
while
we
had
lost
our
own
the
vessel
it
appeared
was
a
gibraltar
privateer
they
took
us
for
french
our
boats
being
fitted
with
thoels
and
grummets
for
the
oars
in
the
french
fashion
and
we
supposed
them
to
be
french
from
their
colours
and
the
language
in
which
they
hailed
us
in
this
affair
we
had
three
officers
killed
or
wounded
and
some
of
our
best
men
the
privateer
was
manned
by
a
mixed
crew
of
all
nations
but
chiefly
greeks
and
although
ostensibly
with
a
commission
signed
by
the
governor
of
gibraltar
were
no
doubt
little
scrupulous
as
to
the
colours
of
any
vessel
they
might
encounter
provided
she
was
not
too
strong
for
them
after
this
unfortunate
mistake
we
proceeded
to
malta
the
captain
expecting
a
severe
rebuke
from
his
admiral
for
his
rashness
in
sending
away
his
boats
to
attack
a
vessel
without
knowing
her
force
fortunately
for
him
the
admiral
was
not
there
and
before
we
met
him
the
number
of
prizes
we
had
taken
were
found
sufficient
in
his
eyes
to
cover
our
multitude
of
sins
so
the
affair
blew
over
while
we
lay
in
malta
harbour
my
friend
murphy
fell
overboard
one
night
just
after
all
the
boats
were
hoisted
in
he
could
not
swim
and
would
have
been
drowned
if
i
had
not
jumped
overboard
and
held
him
up
until
a
boat
was
lowered
down
to
our
assistance
the
officers
and
ship
company
gave
me
more
credit
for
this
action
than
i
really
deserved
to
have
saved
any
person
under
such
circumstances
they
said
was
a
noble
deed
but
to
risk
my
life
for
a
man
who
had
always
from
my
first
coming
into
the
ship
been
my
bitterest
enemy
was
more
than
they
could
have
expected
and
was
undoubtedly
the
noblest
revenge
that
i
could
have
taken
but
they
were
deceived
they
knew
me
not
it
was
my
vanity
and
the
desire
of
oppressing
my
enemy
under
an
intolerable
weight
of
obligation
that
induced
me
to
rush
to
his
rescue
moreover
as
i
stood
on
the
gangway
witnessing
his
struggles
for
life
i
felt
that
i
was
about
to
lose
all
the
revenge
i
had
so
long
laid
up
in
store
in
short
i
could
not
spare
him
and
only
saved
him
as
a
cat
does
a
mouse
to
torment
him
murphy
acknowledged
his
obligations
and
said
the
terrors
of
death
were
upon
him
but
in
a
few
days
forgot
all
i
had
done
for
him
consummated
his
own
disgrace
and
raised
my
character
on
the
ruins
of
his
own
on
some
frivolous
occasion
he
threw
a
basin
of
dirty
water
in
my
face
as
i
passed
through
the
steerage
this
was
too
good
an
opportunity
to
gratify
my
darling
passion
i
had
long
watched
for
an
occasion
to
quarrel
with
him
but
as
he
had
been
ill
during
our
passage
from
gibraltar
to
malta
i
could
not
justify
any
act
of
aggression
he
had
now
recovered
and
was
in
the
plentitude
of
his
strength
and
i
astonished
him
by
striking
the
first
blow
a
followed
i
brought
up
all
my
scientific
powers
in
aid
of
my
strength
and
the
memory
of
former
injuries
i
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
he
never
showed
more
game
but
he
had
everything
to
contend
for
if
i
was
beaten
i
was
only
where
i
was
before
but
with
him
the
case
would
have
been
different
a
fallen
tyrant
has
no
friends
stung
to
madness
by
the
successful
hits
i
planted
in
his
face
he
lost
his
temper
while
i
was
cool
he
fought
wildly
i
stopped
all
his
blows
and
paid
them
with
interest
he
stood
rounds
and
then
gave
in
with
his
eyes
bunged
up
and
his
face
so
swollen
and
so
covered
with
blood
as
not
to
be
known
by
his
friends
if
he
had
had
any
i
had
hardly
a
mark
most
of
our
midshipmen
were
absent
in
prizes
but
the
two
seniors
of
our
berth
an
old
master
mate
past
promotion
and
the
surgeon
assistant
who
had
held
my
wrist
when
i
was
cobbed
were
present
as
the
supporters
of
murphy
during
the
combat
i
always
determined
whenever
i
gained
a
battle
to
follow
it
up
the
shouts
of
victory
resounded
in
the
berth
the
youngsters
joined
with
me
in
songs
of
triumph
and
gave
great
offence
to
the
trio
the
young
esculapius
a
stupid
man
was
fool
enough
to
say
that
although
i
had
beaten
murphy
i
was
not
to
suppose
myself
master
of
the
berth
i
replied
to
this
only
by
throwing
a
biscuit
at
his
head
as
a
shot
of
defiance
and
darting
on
him
before
he
could
get
his
legs
from
under
the
table
i
thrust
my
fingers
into
his
neckcloth
which
i
twisted
so
tightly
that
i
held
him
till
he
was
nearly
choked
giving
his
head
at
the
same
time
two
or
three
good
thumps
against
the
ship
side
finding
that
he
grew
black
in
the
face
i
let
him
go
and
asked
if
he
required
any
further
satisfaction
to
which
he
replied
in
the
negative
and
from
that
day
he
was
always
dutiful
and
obedient
to
me
the
old
superannuated
mate
a
sturdy
merchant
seaman
seemed
greatly
dismayed
at
the
successive
defeats
of
his
allies
and
i
believe
would
have
gladly
concluded
a
separate
peace
he
had
never
offered
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
doctor
although
appealed
to
in
the
most
pitiable
gestures
this
i
observed
with
secret
pleasure
and
would
the
more
willingly
have
given
him
a
brush
as
i
saw
he
was
disinclined
to
make
the
attempt
i
was
however
determined
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
mess
at
twelve
that
night
i
was
relieved
from
the
first
watch
and
coming
down
i
found
the
old
mate
in
a
state
of
beastly
intoxication
thus
he
went
to
his
hammock
and
fell
asleep
while
he
lay
dormant
i
took
a
piece
of
lunar
caustic
which
i
wetted
and
drew
stripes
and
figures
all
over
his
face
increasing
his
natural
ugliness
to
a
frightful
degree
and
made
him
look
very
like
a
new
zealand
warrior
the
next
morning
when
he
was
making
his
toilet
my
party
were
all
ready
prepared
for
the
he
opened
his
little
dirty
chest
and
having
strapped
an
old
razor
and
made
a
lather
in
a
wooden
which
bore
evident
marks
of
the
antique
he
placed
a
triangular
piece
of
a
against
the
reclining
lid
of
the
chest
and
began
the
operation
of
shaving
his
start
back
with
horror
when
he
beheld
his
face
i
shall
never
forget
it
outdid
the
young
roscius
when
he
saw
the
ghost
of
hamlet
having
wetted
his
with
his
tongue
the
old
mate
tried
to
remove
the
stain
of
the
caustic
but
the
d
dpot
still
remained
and
we
like
so
many
young
imps
surrounded
him
roaring
with
laughter
i
boldly
told
him
that
he
bore
my
marks
as
well
as
murphy
and
the
doctor
and
i
added
with
a
degree
of
cruel
mockery
which
might
have
been
spared
that
i
thought
it
right
to
put
all
my
servants
in
black
i
asked
whether
he
was
contented
with
the
arrangement
or
whether
he
chose
to
appeal
against
my
decree
he
signified
that
he
had
no
more
to
say
thus
in
hours
i
had
subdued
the
great
allies
who
had
so
long
oppressed
me
i
immediately
effected
a
revolution
dismissed
the
doctor
from
the
office
of
caterer
took
the
charge
on
myself
and
administered
the
most
impartial
justice
i
made
the
oldsters
pay
their
mess
which
they
had
not
correctly
done
before
i
caused
an
equal
distribution
of
all
luxuries
from
which
the
juniors
had
till
then
been
debarred
and
i
flatter
myself
i
restored
in
some
degree
the
golden
age
in
the
cockpit
there
were
no
more
battles
for
there
was
no
hope
of
victory
on
their
part
nor
anything
to
contend
for
on
mine
i
never
took
any
advantage
of
my
strength
further
than
to
protect
the
youngsters
i
proved
by
this
that
i
was
not
quarrelsome
but
had
only
struggled
for
my
own
emancipation
that
gained
i
was
satisfied
my
conduct
was
explained
to
the
captain
and
the
officers
and
being
fully
and
fairly
discussed
did
me
great
service
i
was
looked
upon
with
respect
and
treated
with
marks
of
confidence
not
usual
towards
a
person
so
young
we
left
malta
expecting
to
find
our
off
toulon
but
it
seldom
happens
that
the
captain
of
a
frigate
is
in
any
hurry
to
join
his
admiral
unless
charged
with
despatches
of
importance
this
not
being
our
case
we
somehow
or
other
tumbled
down
the
mediterranean
before
a
strong
levanter
and
then
had
to
work
back
again
along
the
coast
of
spain
and
france
it
is
an
ill
wind
they
say
that
blows
nobody
good
and
we
found
it
so
with
us
for
off
toulon
in
company
with
the
fleet
if
we
did
take
prizes
they
became
of
little
value
because
there
were
so
many
to
share
them
our
captain
who
was
a
man
of
the
most
consummate
de
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
had
two
reasons
for
sending
his
prizes
to
gibraltar
the
first
was
that
we
should
in
all
probability
be
sent
down
there
to
receive
our
men
and
have
the
advantage
of
the
cruise
back
the
second
that
he
was
well
aware
of
the
corrupt
practices
of
the
at
malta
all
the
vessels
therefore
which
we
had
hitherto
captured
were
sent
to
gibraltar
for
adjudication
and
we
now
added
to
their
number
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
take
a
large
ship
laden
with
barilla
and
a
brig
with
tobacco
and
wine
the
charge
of
the
last
i
was
honoured
with
and
no
prime
minister
ever
held
a
situation
of
such
heavy
responsibility
with
such
corrupt
supporters
so
much
was
the
crew
of
the
frigate
reduced
by
former
captures
and
the
unlucky
affair
with
the
maltese
privateer
that
i
was
only
allowed
three
men
i
was
however
so
delighted
with
my
first
command
that
i
verily
believe
if
they
had
only
given
me
a
dog
and
a
pig
i
should
have
been
satisfied
the
frigate
boat
put
us
on
board
it
blew
fresh
from
the
eastward
and
i
instantly
put
the
helm
up
and
shaped
my
course
for
the
old
rock
the
breeze
soon
freshened
into
a
gale
we
ran
slap
before
it
but
soon
found
it
necessary
to
take
in
the
sails
this
we
at
last
accomplished
one
at
a
time
we
then
thought
a
reef
or
two
in
the
topsails
would
be
acceptable
but
that
was
impossible
we
tried
a
spanish
reef
that
is
let
the
yards
come
down
on
the
cap
and
she
flew
before
the
gale
which
had
now
increased
to
a
very
serious
degree
our
cargo
of
wine
and
tobacco
was
unfortunately
stowed
by
a
spanish
and
not
a
british
owner
the
difference
was
very
material
to
me
an
englishman
knowing
the
vice
of
his
countrymen
would
have
placed
the
wine
underneath
and
the
tobacco
above
unfortunately
it
was
in
this
instance
the
reverse
and
my
men
very
soon
helped
themselves
to
as
much
as
rendered
them
nearly
useless
to
me
being
more
than
half
seas
over
we
got
on
pretty
well
however
till
about
two
in
the
morning
when
the
man
at
the
helm
unable
to
wake
the
other
two
seamen
to
fetch
him
a
drop
thought
he
might
trust
the
brig
to
steer
herself
for
a
minute
while
he
quenched
his
thirst
at
the
the
vessel
instantly
broached
to
that
is
came
with
her
broadside
to
the
wind
and
sea
and
away
went
the
mainmast
by
the
board
fortunately
the
foremast
stood
the
man
who
had
just
quitted
the
helm
had
not
time
to
get
drunk
and
the
other
two
were
so
much
frightened
that
they
got
sober
we
cleared
the
wreck
as
well
as
we
could
got
her
before
the
wind
again
and
continued
on
our
course
but
a
british
sailor
the
most
daring
of
all
men
is
likewise
the
most
regardless
of
warning
or
of
consequences
the
loss
of
the
mainmast
instead
of
showing
my
men
the
madness
of
their
indulgence
in
drink
turned
the
scale
the
opposite
way
if
they
could
get
drunk
with
two
masts
how
much
more
could
they
do
so
with
one
when
they
had
only
half
as
much
sail
to
look
after
with
such
a
rule
of
three
there
was
no
reasoning
and
they
got
drunk
and
continued
drunk
during
the
whole
passage
good
luck
often
attends
us
when
we
do
deserve
it
the
sweet
little
cherub
that
sits
up
aloft
as
dibdin
says
had
an
eye
upon
us
i
knew
we
could
not
easily
get
out
of
the
gut
of
gibraltar
without
knowing
it
and
accordingly
on
the
third
day
after
leaving
the
frigate
we
made
the
rock
early
in
the
morning
and
by
two
rounded
europa
point
i
had
ordered
the
men
to
bend
the
cable
and
like
many
other
young
officers
fancied
it
was
done
because
they
said
it
was
and
because
i
had
ordered
it
it
never
once
occurred
to
me
to
go
and
see
if
my
orders
had
been
executed
indeed
to
say
the
truth
i
had
quite
as
much
as
i
could
turn
my
hand
to
i
was
at
the
helm
from
twelve
at
night
till
six
in
the
morning
looking
out
for
the
land
and
when
i
ordered
one
of
the
men
to
relieve
me
i
directed
him
how
to
steer
and
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
which
lasted
till
ten
after
which
i
was
forced
to
exert
the
whole
of
my
ingenuity
in
order
to
fetch
into
the
bay
and
prevent
being
blown
through
the
gut
so
that
the
bending
of
the
cable
escaped
my
memory
until
the
moment
i
required
the
use
of
the
anchor
as
i
passed
under
the
stern
of
one
of
the
ships
of
war
in
the
bay
with
my
prize
colours
flying
the
officer
on
deck
hailed
me
and
said
i
had
better
shorten
sail
i
thought
so
too
but
how
was
this
to
be
done
my
whole
ship
company
were
too
drunk
to
do
it
and
though
i
begged
for
some
assistance
from
his
majesty
ship
it
blew
so
fresh
and
we
passed
so
quick
that
they
could
not
hear
me
or
were
not
inclined
necessity
has
no
law
i
saw
among
the
other
ships
in
the
bay
a
great
lump
of
a
transport
and
i
thought
she
was
much
better
able
to
bear
the
concussion
i
intended
for
her
than
any
other
vessel
because
i
had
heard
then
and
have
been
made
sure
of
it
since
that
her
owners
like
all
other
owners
were
cheating
the
government
out
of
thousands
of
pounds
a
year
she
was
lying
exactly
in
the
part
of
the
bay
assigned
for
the
prizes
and
as
i
saw
no
other
possible
mode
of
bringing
the
ship
to
anchor
i
steered
for
the
lobster
smack
and
ran
slap
on
board
of
her
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
master
mate
and
crew
the
usual
expletives
a
volley
of
oaths
and
curses
on
our
lubberly
heads
followed
the
shock
this
i
expected
and
was
as
fully
prepared
for
as
i
was
for
the
fall
of
my
foremast
which
taking
the
foreyard
of
the
transport
fell
over
the
starboard
quarter
and
greatly
relieved
me
on
the
subject
of
shortening
sail
thus
my
pretty
brig
was
first
reduced
to
a
sloop
and
then
to
a
hulk
fortunately
her
bottom
was
sound
i
was
soon
cut
clear
of
the
transport
and
called
out
in
a
manly
voice
let
go
the
anchor
this
order
was
obeyed
with
promptitude
away
it
went
sure
enough
but
the
devil
a
cable
was
there
bent
to
it
and
my
men
being
all
stupidly
drunk
i
let
my
vessel
drift
of
a
frigate
the
commanding
officer
of
which
seeing
i
had
no
other
cable
bent
very
kindly
sent
a
few
hands
on
board
to
assist
me
and
by
five
i
was
safely
moored
in
the
bay
of
gibraltar
and
walked
my
as
high
in
my
own
estimation
as
columbus
when
he
made
the
american
islands
but
short
short
was
my
power
my
frigate
arrived
the
next
morning
the
captain
sent
for
me
and
i
gave
him
an
account
of
my
voyage
and
my
disasters
he
very
kindly
consoled
me
for
my
misfortune
and
so
far
from
being
angry
with
me
for
losing
my
masts
said
it
was
wonderful
under
all
circumstances
how
i
had
succeeded
in
saving
the
vessel
we
lay
only
a
fortnight
at
gibraltar
when
news
arrived
that
the
french
had
entered
spain
and
very
shortly
after
orders
came
from
england
to
suspend
all
hostilities
against
the
spaniards
this
we
thought
a
bore
as
it
almost
annihilated
any
chance
of
at
the
same
time
that
it
increased
our
labours
and
stimulated
our
activity
in
a
most
surprising
manner
and
opened
scenes
to
us
far
more
interesting
than
if
the
war
with
spain
had
continued
we
were
ordered
up
to
join
the
admiral
off
toulon
but
desired
to
look
into
the
spanish
port
of
carthagena
on
our
way
and
to
report
the
state
of
the
spanish
squadron
in
that
arsenal
we
were
received
with
great
politeness
by
the
governor
and
the
officers
of
the
spanish
fleet
lying
there
these
people
we
found
were
men
of
talent
and
education
their
ships
were
mostly
dismantled
and
they
had
not
the
means
of
equipping
them
chapter
vi
you
give
me
most
egregious
indignity
ay
with
all
my
heart
and
thou
art
worthy
of
it
well
that
ends
naturally
anxious
to
behold
a
country
from
which
we
had
hitherto
been
excluded
for
so
many
years
we
all
applied
for
leave
to
go
on
shore
and
obtained
it
even
the
seamen
were
allowed
the
same
indulgence
and
went
in
parties
of
twenty
and
thirty
at
a
time
we
were
followed
and
gaped
at
by
the
people
but
shunned
at
the
same
time
as
hereticos
the
inns
of
the
town
like
all
the
rest
of
them
in
spain
have
not
improved
since
the
days
of
the
immortal
santillana
they
were
all
more
or
less
filled
with
the
lowest
of
the
rabble
and
a
set
of
bravos
whose
calling
was
robbery
and
who
cared
little
if
murder
were
its
accompaniment
the
cookery
was
execrable
garlic
and
oil
were
its
principal
ingredients
the
olla
podrida
and
its
constant
attendant
the
tomato
sauce
were
intolerable
but
the
wine
was
very
well
for
a
midshipman
whenever
we
had
a
repast
in
any
of
these
houses
the
bravos
endeavoured
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
us
and
these
fellows
being
always
armed
with
stilettos
we
found
it
necessary
to
be
equally
well
prepared
and
whenever
we
seated
ourselves
at
a
table
we
never
failed
to
display
the
butts
of
our
pistols
which
kept
them
in
decent
order
for
they
are
as
cowardly
as
they
are
thievish
our
seamen
not
being
so
cautious
or
so
well
provided
with
arms
were
frequently
robbed
and
assassinated
by
these
rascals
i
was
on
one
occasion
near
falling
a
victim
to
them
walking
in
the
evening
with
the
second
master
and
having
a
pretty
little
spanish
girl
under
my
arm
for
to
my
shame
be
it
spoken
i
had
already
formed
an
acquaintance
with
the
frail
sisterhood
four
of
these
villains
accosted
us
we
soon
perceived
by
their
manner
of
holding
their
cloaks
that
they
had
their
stilettos
ready
i
desired
my
companion
to
draw
his
dirk
to
keep
close
to
me
and
not
to
let
them
get
between
us
and
the
wall
seeing
that
we
were
prepared
they
wished
us
good
night
and
endeavouring
to
put
us
off
our
guard
by
entering
into
conversation
asked
us
to
give
them
a
cigar
which
my
companion
would
have
done
had
i
not
cautioned
him
not
to
quit
his
dirk
with
his
right
hand
for
this
was
all
they
wanted
in
this
defensive
posture
we
continued
until
we
had
nearly
reached
the
plaza
or
great
square
where
many
people
were
walking
and
enjoying
themselves
by
moonlight
the
usual
custom
of
the
country
now
said
i
to
my
friend
let
us
make
a
start
from
these
fellows
when
i
run
do
you
follow
me
and
do
stop
till
we
are
in
the
middle
of
the
square
the
manoeuvre
was
successful
we
the
thieves
who
were
not
aware
of
our
plan
and
were
encumbered
with
their
heavy
cloaks
finding
we
had
escaped
they
turned
upon
the
girl
and
robbed
her
of
her
miserable
earnings
this
we
saw
but
could
not
prevent
such
was
the
police
of
spain
then
nor
has
it
improved
since
this
was
the
last
time
i
ventured
on
shore
at
night
except
to
go
once
with
a
party
of
our
officers
to
the
house
of
the
spanish
admiral
who
had
a
very
pretty
niece
and
was
enough
not
to
frown
on
us
poor
heretics
she
was
indeed
a
pretty
creature
her
lovely
black
eyes
long
eyelashes
and
raven
hair
betrayed
a
symptom
of
moorish
blood
at
the
same
time
that
her
ancient
and
high
gave
her
the
envied
appellation
of
this
fair
creature
was
pleased
to
bestow
a
furtive
glance
of
approbation
on
my
youthful
form
and
handsome
dress
my
vanity
was
tickled
i
spoke
french
to
her
she
understood
it
imperfectly
and
pretended
to
know
still
less
of
it
from
the
hatred
borne
by
all
the
spaniards
at
that
time
to
the
french
nation
we
improved
our
time
however
which
was
but
short
and
before
we
parted
perfectly
understood
each
other
i
thought
i
could
be
contented
to
give
up
everything
and
reside
with
her
in
the
wilds
of
spain
the
time
of
our
departure
came
and
i
was
torn
away
from
my
rosaritta
not
without
the
suspicions
of
my
captain
and
shipmates
that
i
had
been
a
too
highly
favoured
youth
this
was
not
true
i
loved
the
dear
angel
but
never
had
wronged
her
and
i
went
to
sea
in
a
mood
which
i
sometimes
thought
might
end
in
an
act
of
desperation
but
salt
water
is
an
admirable
specific
against
love
at
least
against
such
love
as
that
was
we
joined
the
admiral
off
toulon
and
were
ordered
by
him
to
cruise
between
perpignan
and
marseilles
we
parted
from
the
fleet
on
the
following
day
and
kept
the
coast
in
a
continued
state
of
alarm
not
a
vessel
dared
to
show
her
nose
out
of
port
we
had
her
if
she
did
batteries
we
laughed
at
and
either
silenced
them
with
our
long
or
landed
and
blew
them
up
in
one
of
these
little
skirmishes
i
had
very
nearly
been
taken
and
should
in
that
case
have
missed
all
the
honour
and
glory
and
hairbreadth
escapes
which
will
be
found
related
in
the
following
pages
i
should
either
have
been
sabred
in
mere
retaliation
or
marched
off
to
verdun
for
the
remaining
six
years
of
the
war
we
had
landed
to
storm
and
blow
up
a
battery
for
which
purpose
we
carried
with
us
a
bag
of
powder
and
a
train
of
canvas
everything
went
on
prosperously
we
came
to
a
canal
which
it
was
necessary
to
cross
and
the
best
swimmers
were
selected
to
convey
the
powder
over
without
wetting
it
i
was
one
of
them
i
took
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
to
save
them
and
after
we
had
taken
the
battery
i
was
so
intent
on
looking
for
the
telegraphic
that
i
had
quite
forgotten
the
intended
explosion
until
i
heard
a
cry
of
run
run
from
those
outside
who
had
lighted
the
train
i
was
at
that
moment
on
the
wall
of
the
fort
nearly
thirty
feet
high
but
sloping
i
jumped
one
part
and
scrambled
the
other
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
i
could
amidst
a
shower
of
stones
which
fell
around
me
like
an
eruption
of
vesuvius
luckily
i
was
not
hit
but
i
had
cut
my
foot
in
the
leap
and
was
in
much
pain
i
had
two
fields
of
stubble
to
pass
and
my
shoes
and
stockings
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
canal
the
sharp
straw
entered
the
wound
and
almost
drove
me
mad
and
i
was
tempted
to
sit
down
and
resign
myself
to
my
fate
however
i
persevered
and
had
nearly
reached
the
boats
which
were
putting
off
not
aware
of
my
absence
when
a
noise
like
distant
thunder
reached
my
ears
this
i
soon
found
was
cavalry
from
cotte
which
had
come
to
defend
the
battery
i
mustered
all
my
strength
and
plunged
into
the
sea
to
swim
off
to
the
boats
and
so
little
time
had
i
to
spare
that
some
of
the
enemy
chasseurs
on
their
black
horses
swam
in
after
me
and
fired
their
pistols
at
my
head
the
boats
were
at
this
time
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
shore
the
officers
in
them
fortunately
perceived
the
cavalry
and
saw
me
at
the
same
time
a
boat
laid
on
her
oars
which
with
great
difficulty
i
reached
and
was
taken
in
but
so
exhausted
with
pain
and
loss
of
blood
that
i
was
carried
on
board
almost
dead
my
foot
was
cut
to
the
bone
and
i
continued
a
month
under
the
surgeon
care
i
had
nearly
recovered
from
this
accident
when
we
captured
a
ship
with
which
murphy
was
sent
as
and
the
same
evening
a
schooner
which
we
cut
out
from
her
anchorage
the
command
of
this
latter
vessel
was
given
to
me
it
was
late
in
the
evening
and
the
hurry
was
so
great
that
the
keg
of
spirits
intended
for
myself
and
crew
was
not
put
on
board
this
was
going
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
in
my
last
ship
we
had
too
much
liquor
and
in
this
too
little
naturally
thirsty
our
desire
for
drink
needed
not
the
stimulus
of
salt
fish
and
calavances
for
such
was
our
cargo
and
such
was
our
food
and
deeply
did
we
deplore
the
loss
of
our
spirits
on
the
third
day
after
leaving
the
frigate
on
our
way
to
gibraltar
i
fell
in
with
a
ship
on
the
coast
of
spain
and
knew
it
to
be
the
one
murphy
commanded
by
a
remarkable
white
patch
in
the
i
made
all
sail
in
chase
in
hopes
of
obtaining
some
spirits
from
him
knowing
that
he
had
more
than
he
could
consume
even
if
he
and
his
people
got
drunk
every
day
when
i
came
near
him
he
made
all
the
sail
he
could
at
dusk
i
was
near
enough
almost
to
hail
him
but
he
stood
on
and
i
having
a
couple
of
small
on
board
with
some
powder
fired
one
of
them
as
a
signal
this
i
repeated
again
and
again
but
he
would
not
bring
to
and
when
it
was
dark
i
lost
sight
of
him
and
saw
him
no
more
until
we
met
at
gibraltar
next
morning
i
fell
in
with
three
spanish
they
took
me
for
a
french
privateer
pulled
up
their
lines
and
made
sail
i
came
up
with
them
and
firing
a
gun
they
hove
to
and
surrendered
i
ordered
them
alongside
and
finding
they
had
each
a
keg
of
wine
on
board
i
condemned
that
part
of
their
cargo
as
contraband
but
i
honestly
offered
payment
for
what
i
had
taken
this
they
declined
finding
i
was
too
happy
to
think
they
were
not
in
the
hands
of
the
french
i
then
gave
each
of
them
a
pound
of
tobacco
which
not
only
satisfied
them
but
confirmed
them
in
the
opinion
among
their
countrymen
that
england
was
the
bravest
as
well
as
the
most
generous
of
nations
they
offered
everything
their
boat
contained
but
i
declined
all
most
nobly
because
i
had
obtained
all
i
wanted
and
we
parted
with
mutual
good
will
they
shouting
viva
ingleterre
and
we
drinking
them
a
good
passage
in
their
own
wine
many
days
elapsed
before
we
reached
gibraltar
the
winds
were
light
and
the
weather
fine
but
as
we
had
discovered
that
the
had
wine
we
took
care
to
supply
our
cellar
without
any
trouble
from
the
excise
and
from
our
equitable
mode
of
barter
i
had
no
reason
to
think
that
his
majesty
king
george
lost
any
of
his
deserved
popularity
by
our
conduct
when
we
reached
gibraltar
i
had
still
a
couple
of
good
kegs
wherewith
to
regale
my
messmates
though
i
was
sorry
to
find
the
frigate
and
the
rest
of
her
prizes
had
got
in
before
us
murphy
indeed
did
not
arrive
till
the
day
after
me
i
was
on
the
when
he
came
in
and
to
my
astonishment
he
reported
that
he
had
been
chased
by
a
french
privateer
and
had
beat
her
off
after
a
four
hours
action
that
his
rigging
had
suffered
a
good
deal
but
that
he
had
not
a
man
hurt
i
let
him
run
on
till
the
evening
many
believed
him
but
some
doubted
at
dinner
in
the
his
arrogance
knew
no
bounds
and
when
half
drunk
my
three
men
were
magnified
into
a
brig
as
full
of
men
and
guns
as
she
could
stuff
sick
of
all
this
nonsense
i
then
simply
related
the
story
as
it
had
occurred
and
sent
for
the
who
was
with
me
and
who
confirmed
all
my
statement
from
that
moment
he
was
a
mark
of
contempt
in
the
ship
every
lie
was
a
murphy
and
every
murphy
a
liar
he
dared
not
resent
this
scorn
of
ours
and
found
himself
so
uncomfortable
that
he
offered
no
objection
to
the
removal
proposed
by
the
captain
his
character
followed
him
and
he
never
obtained
promotion
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
reflect
that
i
not
only
had
my
full
revenge
on
this
man
but
that
i
had
been
the
instrument
of
turning
him
out
of
an
honourable
profession
which
he
would
have
disgraced
this
was
no
time
for
frigates
to
be
idle
and
if
i
chose
to
give
the
name
of
mine
and
my
captain
the
naval
history
of
the
country
would
prove
that
ours
of
all
other
ships
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
in
the
cause
of
spanish
freedom
the
south
of
spain
became
the
theatre
of
the
most
cruel
and
desolating
war
our
station
was
off
barcelona
and
thence
to
perpignan
the
frontier
of
france
on
the
borders
of
spain
our
duty
for
which
the
enterprising
disposition
of
our
captain
was
admirably
calculated
was
to
support
the
guerilla
chiefs
to
cut
off
the
enemy
convoys
of
provisions
either
by
sea
or
along
the
road
which
lay
by
the
or
to
dislodge
the
enemy
from
any
stronghold
he
might
be
in
possession
of
i
was
absent
from
the
ship
on
such
services
three
and
four
weeks
at
a
time
being
attached
to
a
division
of
men
under
the
command
of
the
third
lieutenant
we
suffered
very
much
from
privations
of
all
kinds
we
never
took
with
us
more
than
one
week
provision
and
were
frequently
three
weeks
without
receiving
any
supply
in
the
article
of
dress
our
catalogue
of
negatives
as
a
celebrated
author
says
was
very
copious
we
had
no
shoes
nor
stockings
no
linen
and
not
all
of
us
had
hats
a
was
the
common
substitute
for
this
article
we
clambered
over
rocks
and
wandered
through
the
flinty
or
muddy
ravines
in
company
with
our
new
allies
the
hardy
mountaineers
these
men
respected
our
valour
but
did
not
like
our
religion
or
our
manners
they
cheerfully
divided
their
rations
with
us
but
were
always
inexorable
in
their
cruelty
to
the
french
prisoners
and
no
persuasion
of
ours
could
induce
them
to
spare
the
lives
of
one
of
these
unhappy
people
whose
cries
and
entreaties
to
the
english
to
intercede
for
or
save
them
were
always
unavailing
they
were
either
stabbed
before
our
faces
or
dragged
to
the
top
of
a
hill
commanding
a
view
of
some
fortress
occupied
by
the
french
and
in
sight
of
their
countrymen
their
throats
were
cut
from
ear
to
ear
should
the
christian
reader
condemn
this
horrid
barbarity
as
he
certainly
will
he
must
remember
that
those
people
were
men
whose
every
feeling
had
been
outraged
rape
conflagration
murder
and
famine
had
everywhere
followed
the
step
of
the
cruel
invaders
and
however
we
might
lament
their
fate
and
endeavour
to
avert
it
we
could
not
but
admit
that
the
retaliation
was
not
without
justice
in
this
irregular
warfare
we
sometimes
revelled
in
luxuries
and
at
others
were
nearly
starved
one
day
in
particular
when
fainting
with
hunger
we
met
a
fat
capuchin
we
begged
him
to
show
us
where
we
might
procure
some
food
either
by
purchase
or
in
any
other
way
but
he
neither
knew
where
to
procure
any
nor
had
he
any
money
his
order
he
said
forbade
him
to
use
it
as
he
turned
away
from
us
in
some
precipitation
we
thought
we
heard
something
rattle
and
as
necessity
has
no
law
we
took
the
liberty
of
searching
the
padre
on
whose
person
we
found
forty
dollars
of
which
we
relieved
him
assuring
him
that
our
consciences
were
perfectly
clear
since
his
order
forbade
him
to
carry
money
and
that
as
he
lived
among
good
christians
they
would
not
allow
him
to
want
he
cursed
us
but
we
laughed
at
him
because
he
had
produced
his
own
misfortune
by
his
falsehood
and
hypocrisy
this
was
the
manner
in
which
the
spanish
priests
generally
behaved
to
us
and
in
this
way
we
generally
repaid
them
when
we
could
we
kept
the
plunder
converted
it
into
food
joined
our
party
soon
after
and
supposed
the
affair
was
over
but
the
friar
had
followed
us
at
a
distance
and
we
perceived
him
coming
up
the
hill
where
we
were
stationed
to
avoid
discovery
we
exchanged
clothes
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
us
no
longer
cognizable
the
friar
made
his
complaint
to
the
guerilla
chief
whose
eyes
flashed
fire
at
the
indignant
treatment
his
priest
had
received
and
it
is
probable
that
bloodshed
would
have
ensued
had
he
been
able
to
point
out
the
culprits
i
kept
my
countenance
though
i
had
changed
my
dress
and
as
he
looked
at
me
with
something
beyond
suspicion
i
stared
him
full
in
the
face
with
the
whole
united
powers
of
my
matchless
impudence
and
in
a
loud
and
menacing
tone
of
voice
asked
him
in
french
if
he
took
me
for
a
brigand
this
question
as
well
as
the
manner
in
which
it
was
put
silenced
if
it
did
not
satisfy
the
priest
he
seemed
to
listen
with
apparent
conviction
to
the
suggestion
of
some
of
our
people
that
he
had
been
robbed
by
another
party
and
he
set
out
in
pursuit
of
them
i
was
quite
tired
of
his
importunities
and
glad
to
see
him
depart
as
he
turned
away
he
gave
me
a
very
scrutinizing
look
which
i
returned
with
another
full
of
well
dissembled
rage
and
scorn
my
curling
hair
had
been
well
flattened
down
with
a
piece
of
soap
which
i
had
in
my
pocket
and
i
had
much
more
the
appearance
of
a
methodist
parson
than
a
pickpocket
some
time
previous
to
this
the
frigate
to
which
i
belonged
had
been
ordered
on
other
services
and
as
i
had
no
opportunity
of
joining
her
i
was
placed
on
board
of
another
but
as
this
chapter
has
already
spun
out
its
length
i
shall
refer
my
reader
to
the
next
for
further
particulars
chapter
vii
the
shout
of
battle
now
began
and
rushing
sound
of
onset
host
and
host
but
narrow
space
was
left
from
the
deservedly
high
character
borne
by
the
captain
of
the
frigate
which
i
was
ordered
to
join
he
was
employed
by
lord
collingwood
on
the
most
confidential
services
and
we
were
sent
to
assist
the
spaniards
in
their
defence
of
the
important
fortress
of
rosas
in
catalonia
it
has
already
been
observed
that
the
french
general
st
cyr
had
entered
that
country
and
having
taken
figueras
and
gerona
was
looking
with
a
wistful
eye
on
the
castle
of
trinity
on
the
side
the
capture
of
which
would
be
a
certain
prelude
to
the
fall
of
rosas
my
captain
determined
to
defend
it
although
it
had
just
been
abandoned
by
another
british
naval
officer
as
untenable
i
volunteered
though
a
supernumerary
to
be
one
of
the
party
and
was
sent
nor
can
i
but
acknowledge
that
the
officer
who
had
abandoned
the
place
had
shown
more
than
a
sound
discretion
every
part
of
the
castle
was
in
ruins
heaps
of
crumbling
stones
and
rubbish
broken
and
split
guns
presented
to
my
mind
a
very
unfavourable
field
of
battle
the
only
advantage
we
appeared
to
have
over
the
assailants
was
that
the
breach
which
they
had
effected
in
the
walls
was
steep
in
its
ascent
and
the
loose
stones
either
fell
down
upon
them
or
gave
way
under
their
feet
while
we
plied
them
with
every
kind
of
missile
this
was
our
only
defence
and
all
we
had
to
prevent
the
enemy
marching
into
the
works
if
works
they
could
be
called
there
was
another
and
very
serious
disadvantage
attending
our
locality
the
castle
was
situated
very
near
the
summit
of
a
steep
hill
the
upper
part
of
which
was
in
possession
of
the
enemy
who
were
by
this
means
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
top
of
the
castle
and
on
that
eminence
three
hundred
swiss
sharpshooters
had
effected
a
lodgment
and
thrown
up
works
within
fifty
yards
of
us
keeping
up
a
constant
fire
at
the
castle
if
a
head
was
seen
above
the
walls
twenty
whizzed
at
it
in
a
moment
and
the
same
unremitted
attention
was
paid
to
our
boats
as
they
landed
on
another
hill
much
to
the
northward
and
consequently
further
inland
the
french
had
erected
a
battery
of
six
this
agreeable
neighbour
was
only
three
hundred
yards
from
us
and
allowing
short
intervals
for
the
guns
to
cool
this
battery
kept
up
a
constant
fire
upon
us
from
daylight
till
dark
i
never
could
have
supposed
in
my
boyish
days
that
the
time
would
arrive
when
i
should
envy
a
cock
upon
shrove
tuesday
yet
such
was
my
case
when
in
this
infernal
castle
it
was
certainly
not
giving
us
fair
play
we
had
no
chance
against
such
a
force
but
my
captain
was
a
and
as
i
had
volunteered
i
had
no
right
to
complain
such
was
the
precision
of
the
enemy
fire
that
we
could
tell
the
stone
that
would
be
hit
by
the
next
shot
merely
from
seeing
where
the
last
had
struck
and
our
men
were
frequently
wounded
by
the
splinters
of
granite
with
which
the
walls
were
built
and
others
picked
off
like
partridges
by
the
swiss
corps
on
the
hill
close
to
us
our
force
in
the
castle
consisted
of
a
hundred
and
thirty
english
seamen
and
marines
one
company
of
spanish
and
another
of
swiss
troops
in
spanish
pay
never
were
troops
worse
paid
and
fed
or
better
fired
at
we
all
pigged
in
together
dirty
straw
and
fleas
for
our
beds
our
food
on
the
same
scale
of
luxury
from
the
captain
downwards
there
was
no
distinction
fighting
is
sometimes
a
very
agreeable
pastime
but
excess
palls
on
the
sense
and
here
we
had
enough
of
it
without
what
i
always
thought
an
indispensable
accompaniment
namely
a
good
bellyful
nor
did
i
conceive
how
a
man
could
perform
his
duty
without
it
but
here
i
was
forced
with
many
others
to
make
the
experiment
and
when
the
boats
could
not
land
which
was
often
the
case
we
piped
to
dinner
as
our
captain
liked
regularity
and
drank
cold
water
to
fill
our
stomachs
i
have
often
heard
my
poor
old
uncle
say
that
no
man
knows
what
he
can
do
till
he
tries
and
the
enemy
gave
us
plenty
of
opportunities
of
displaying
our
ingenuity
industry
watchfulness
and
abstinence
when
poor
penelope
wove
her
web
the
poet
says
the
night
unravelled
what
the
day
began
with
us
it
was
precisely
the
reverse
the
day
destroyed
all
the
labours
of
the
night
the
hours
of
darkness
were
employed
by
us
in
filling
and
laying
them
in
the
breach
clearing
away
rubbish
and
preparing
to
receive
the
enemy
fire
which
was
sure
to
recommence
at
daylight
these
avocations
together
with
a
constant
and
most
vigilant
watch
against
surprise
took
up
so
much
of
our
time
that
little
was
left
for
repose
and
our
meals
required
still
less
there
was
some
originality
in
one
of
our
modes
of
defence
and
which
not
being
might
have
provoked
the
smile
of
an
engineer
the
captain
contrived
to
make
a
shoot
of
smooth
deal
boards
which
he
received
from
the
ship
these
he
placed
in
a
slanting
direction
in
the
breach
and
caused
them
to
be
well
greased
with
cook
slush
so
that
the
enemies
who
wished
to
come
into
our
hold
must
have
jumped
down
upon
them
and
would
in
an
instant
be
precipitated
into
the
ditch
below
a
very
considerable
depth
where
they
might
either
have
remained
till
the
doctor
came
to
them
or
if
they
were
able
begin
their
labours
this
was
a
very
good
for
at
that
time
i
thought
just
as
little
of
killing
a
frenchman
as
i
did
of
destroying
the
filthy
little
nightly
depredator
just
mentioned
besides
this
slippery
trick
which
we
played
them
with
great
success
we
served
them
another
we
happened
to
have
on
board
the
frigate
a
large
quantity
of
fishhooks
these
we
planted
not
only
on
the
greasy
boards
but
in
every
part
where
the
intruders
were
likely
to
place
their
hands
or
feet
the
breach
itself
was
mined
and
loaded
with
shells
and
masked
guns
charged
up
to
the
muzzle
with
enfiladed
the
spot
in
every
direction
such
were
our
defences
and
considering
that
we
had
been
three
weeks
in
the
castle
opposed
to
such
mighty
odds
it
is
surprising
that
we
only
lost
twenty
men
the
crisis
was
now
approaching
one
morning
very
early
i
happened
to
have
the
the
streak
of
fog
which
during
the
night
hangs
between
the
hills
in
that
country
and
presses
down
into
the
valleys
had
just
begun
to
rise
and
the
stars
to
grow
more
dim
above
our
heads
when
i
was
looking
over
the
towards
the
breach
the
captain
came
out
and
asked
me
what
i
was
looking
at
i
told
him
i
hardly
knew
but
there
did
appear
something
unusual
in
the
valley
immediately
below
the
breach
he
listened
a
moment
looked
attentively
with
his
and
exclaimed
in
his
firm
voice
but
in
an
undertoned
manner
to
arms
they
are
coming
in
three
minutes
every
man
was
at
his
post
and
though
all
were
quick
there
was
no
time
to
spare
for
by
this
time
the
black
column
of
the
enemy
was
distinctly
visible
curling
along
the
valley
like
a
great
centipede
and
with
the
daring
enterprise
so
common
among
the
troops
of
napoleon
had
begun
in
silence
to
mount
the
breach
it
was
an
awful
and
eventful
moment
but
the
coolness
and
determination
of
the
little
garrison
was
equal
to
the
occasion
the
word
was
given
to
take
good
aim
and
a
volley
from
the
masked
guns
and
musketry
was
poured
into
the
thick
of
them
they
paused
deep
groans
ascended
they
retreated
a
few
paces
in
confusion
then
rallied
and
again
advanced
to
the
attack
and
now
the
fire
on
both
sides
was
kept
up
without
intermission
the
great
guns
from
the
hill
fort
and
the
swiss
sharpshooters
still
nearer
poured
copious
volleys
upon
us
and
with
loud
shouts
cheered
on
their
comrades
to
the
assault
as
they
approached
and
covered
our
mine
the
train
was
fired
and
up
they
went
in
the
air
and
down
they
fell
buried
in
the
ruins
groans
screams
confusion
french
yells
british
hurras
rent
the
sky
the
hills
resounded
with
the
shouts
of
victory
we
sent
them
in
abundance
and
broke
their
shins
in
glorious
style
i
must
say
that
the
french
behaved
nobly
though
many
a
tall
grenadier
and
pioneer
fell
by
the
symbol
in
front
of
his
warlike
cap
i
cried
with
rage
and
excitement
and
we
all
fought
like
for
we
knew
there
was
no
quarter
to
be
given
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
since
the
firing
began
and
in
that
time
many
a
brave
fellow
had
bit
the
dust
the
head
of
their
attacking
column
had
been
destroyed
by
the
explosion
of
our
mine
still
they
had
and
were
again
up
the
breach
when
the
day
began
to
dawn
and
we
saw
a
chosen
body
of
one
thousand
men
led
on
by
their
colonel
and
advancing
over
the
dead
which
had
just
fallen
the
gallant
leader
appeared
to
be
as
cool
and
composed
as
if
he
were
at
breakfast
with
his
drawn
sword
he
pointed
to
the
breach
and
we
heard
him
exclaim
moi
i
felt
jealous
of
this
brave
fellow
jealous
of
his
being
a
frenchman
and
i
threw
a
lighted
between
his
feet
he
picked
it
up
and
threw
it
from
him
to
a
considerable
distance
cool
chap
enough
that
said
the
captain
who
stood
close
to
me
i
give
him
another
which
he
did
but
this
the
officer
kicked
away
with
equal
and
dignity
nothing
will
cure
that
fellow
resumed
the
captain
but
an
ounce
of
lead
on
an
empty
stomach
it
a
pity
too
to
kill
so
fine
a
fellow
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
so
saying
he
took
a
musket
out
of
my
hand
which
i
had
just
loaded
aimed
fired
the
colonel
staggered
clapped
his
hand
to
his
breast
and
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
some
of
his
men
who
threw
down
their
muskets
and
took
him
on
their
shoulders
either
unconscious
or
perfectly
regardless
of
the
which
was
going
on
around
them
the
firing
redoubled
from
our
musketry
on
this
little
group
every
man
of
whom
was
either
killed
or
wounded
the
colonel
again
left
to
himself
tottered
a
few
paces
further
till
he
reached
a
small
bush
not
ten
yards
from
the
spot
where
he
received
his
mortal
wound
here
he
fell
his
sword
which
he
still
grasped
in
his
right
hand
rested
on
the
boughs
and
pointed
upwards
to
the
sky
as
if
directing
the
road
to
the
spirit
of
its
gallant
master
with
the
life
of
the
colonel
ended
the
hopes
of
the
french
for
that
day
the
officers
we
could
perceive
did
their
duty
cheered
encouraged
and
drove
on
their
men
but
all
in
vain
we
saw
them
pass
their
swords
through
the
bodies
of
the
fugitives
but
the
men
did
not
even
mind
that
they
would
only
be
killed
in
their
own
way
they
had
had
fighting
enough
for
one
breakfast
the
first
impulse
the
fiery
onset
had
been
checked
by
the
fall
of
their
brave
leader
and
qui
whether
coming
from
the
officers
or
drummers
no
matter
which
terminated
the
affair
and
we
were
left
a
little
time
to
breathe
and
to
count
the
number
of
our
dead
the
moment
the
french
perceived
from
their
batteries
that
the
attempt
had
failed
and
that
the
leader
of
the
enterprise
was
dead
they
poured
in
an
angry
fire
upon
us
i
stuck
my
hat
on
the
bayonet
of
my
musket
and
just
showed
it
above
the
wall
a
dozen
bullets
were
through
it
in
a
minute
very
fortunately
my
head
was
not
in
it
the
fire
of
the
batteries
having
ceased
which
it
generally
did
at
stated
periods
we
had
an
opportunity
of
examining
the
point
of
attack
and
dead
bodies
lay
in
profusion
all
the
wounded
had
been
removed
but
what
magnificent
food
for
powder
were
the
bodies
which
lay
before
us
all
it
would
seem
picked
men
not
one
less
than
six
feet
and
some
more
they
were
clad
in
their
grey
to
render
their
appearance
more
and
less
discernible
in
the
twilight
of
the
morning
and
as
the
weather
was
cold
during
the
nights
i
secretly
determined
to
have
one
of
those
great
coats
as
a
to
keep
me
warm
in
i
also
resolved
to
have
the
colonel
sword
to
present
to
my
captain
and
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
i
walked
down
the
breach
brought
up
one
of
the
which
i
deposited
in
the
castle
and
having
done
so
much
for
the
king
i
set
out
to
do
something
for
myself
it
was
pitch
dark
i
stumbled
on
the
wind
blew
a
hurricane
and
the
dust
and
mortar
almost
blinded
me
but
i
knew
my
way
pretty
well
yet
there
was
something
very
in
wandering
about
among
dead
bodies
in
the
and
i
really
felt
a
horror
at
my
situation
there
was
a
dreadful
stillness
between
the
blasts
which
the
pitch
darkness
made
peculiarly
awful
to
an
unfortified
mind
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
would
ever
discourage
unless
you
can
rely
on
your
men
they
generally
fail
because
the
man
of
common
bravery
who
would
acquit
himself
fairly
in
broad
daylight
will
hang
back
during
the
night
fear
and
darkness
have
always
been
firm
allies
and
are
inseparably
playing
into
each
other
hands
darkness
conceals
fear
and
therefore
fear
loves
darkness
because
it
saves
the
coward
from
shame
and
when
the
fear
of
shame
is
the
only
stimulus
to
fight
daylight
is
essentially
necessary
i
crept
cautiously
along
feeling
for
the
dead
bodies
the
first
i
laid
my
hand
on
made
my
blood
curdle
it
was
the
lacerated
thigh
of
a
grenadier
whose
flesh
had
been
torn
off
by
a
friend
said
i
if
i
may
judge
from
the
nature
of
your
wound
your
great
coat
is
not
worth
having
the
next
subject
i
handled
had
been
better
killed
a
through
his
head
had
settled
all
his
bills
and
i
hesitated
not
in
becoming
residuary
legatee
as
i
was
sure
the
assets
would
more
than
discharge
the
undertaker
bill
but
the
body
was
cold
and
stiff
and
did
not
readily
yield
its
garment
i
however
succeeded
in
obtaining
my
object
in
which
i
arrayed
myself
and
went
on
in
search
of
the
colonel
sword
but
here
i
had
been
anticipated
by
a
frenchman
the
colonel
indeed
lay
there
stiff
enough
but
his
sword
was
gone
i
was
preparing
to
return
when
i
encountered
not
a
dead
but
a
living
enemy
said
a
low
voice
answered
i
in
a
low
tone
and
added
les
corsairs
ne
se
battent
said
he
and
growling
he
was
soon
out
of
sight
i
scrambled
back
to
the
castle
gave
the
countersign
to
the
sentinel
and
showed
my
new
great
coat
with
a
vast
deal
of
glee
and
satisfaction
some
of
my
comrades
went
on
the
same
sort
of
expedition
and
were
rewarded
with
more
or
less
success
in
a
few
days
the
dead
bodies
on
the
breach
were
nearly
denuded
by
nightly
visitors
but
that
of
the
colonel
lay
respected
and
untouched
the
heat
of
the
day
had
blackened
it
and
it
was
now
deprived
of
all
its
manly
beauty
and
nothing
remained
but
a
loathsome
corpse
the
rules
of
war
as
well
as
of
humanity
demanded
the
honourable
interment
of
the
remains
of
this
hero
and
our
captain
who
was
the
very
flower
of
chivalry
desired
me
to
stick
a
white
handkerchief
on
a
pike
as
a
flag
of
truce
and
bury
the
bodies
if
the
enemy
would
permit
us
i
went
out
accordingly
with
a
spade
and
a
but
the
on
the
hill
began
with
their
rifles
and
wounded
one
of
my
men
i
looked
at
the
captain
as
much
as
to
say
am
i
to
proceed
he
motioned
with
his
hand
to
go
on
and
i
then
began
digging
a
hole
by
the
side
of
a
dead
body
and
the
enemy
seeing
my
intention
desisted
from
firing
i
had
buried
several
when
the
captain
came
out
and
joined
me
with
a
view
of
reconnoitring
the
position
of
the
enemy
he
was
seen
from
the
fort
and
recognized
and
his
intention
pretty
accurately
guessed
at
we
were
near
the
body
of
the
colonel
which
we
were
going
to
inter
when
the
captain
observing
a
diamond
ring
on
the
finger
of
the
corpse
said
to
one
of
the
sailors
you
may
just
as
well
take
that
off
it
can
be
of
no
use
to
him
now
the
man
tried
to
get
it
off
but
the
rigidity
of
the
muscle
after
death
prevented
his
moving
it
he
wo
feel
your
knife
poor
fellow
said
the
captain
and
a
finger
more
or
less
is
no
great
matter
to
him
now
off
with
it
the
sailor
began
to
saw
the
with
his
knife
when
down
came
a
pound
shot
and
with
such
a
good
direction
that
it
took
the
shoe
off
the
man
foot
and
the
shovel
out
of
the
hand
of
another
man
in
with
him
and
cover
him
up
said
the
captain
we
did
so
when
another
shot
not
quite
so
well
directed
as
the
first
threw
the
dirt
in
our
faces
and
ploughed
the
ground
at
our
feet
the
captain
then
ordered
his
men
to
run
into
the
castle
which
they
instantly
obeyed
while
he
himself
walked
leisurely
along
through
a
shower
of
from
those
cursed
swiss
dogs
whom
i
most
fervently
wished
at
the
devil
because
as
an
i
felt
bound
in
honour
as
well
as
duty
to
walk
by
the
side
of
my
captain
fully
expecting
every
moment
that
a
would
have
hit
me
where
i
should
have
been
ashamed
to
show
the
scar
i
thought
this
funeral
pace
after
the
funeral
was
over
confounded
nonsense
but
my
captain
never
had
run
away
from
a
frenchman
and
did
not
intend
to
begin
then
i
was
behind
him
making
these
reflections
and
as
the
shot
began
to
fly
very
thick
i
stepped
up
alongside
of
him
and
by
degrees
brought
him
between
me
and
the
fire
sir
said
i
as
i
am
only
a
midshipman
i
do
care
so
much
about
honour
as
you
do
and
therefore
if
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
i
take
the
liberty
of
getting
under
your
lee
he
laughed
and
said
i
did
not
know
you
were
here
for
i
meant
you
should
have
gone
with
the
others
but
since
you
are
out
of
your
station
mr
mildmay
i
will
make
that
use
of
you
which
you
so
ingeniously
proposed
to
make
of
me
my
life
may
be
of
some
importance
here
but
yours
very
little
and
another
midshipman
can
be
had
from
the
ship
only
for
asking
so
just
drop
astern
if
you
please
and
do
duty
as
a
breastwork
for
me
certainly
sir
said
i
by
all
means
and
i
took
my
station
accordingly
now
said
the
captain
if
you
are
i
will
take
you
on
my
shoulders
i
expressed
myself
exceedingly
obliged
not
only
for
the
honour
he
had
conferred
on
me
but
also
for
that
which
he
intended
but
hoped
i
should
have
no
occasion
to
trouble
him
whether
the
enemy
took
pity
on
my
youth
and
or
whether
they
purposely
missed
us
i
can
not
say
i
only
know
i
was
very
happy
when
i
found
myself
inside
the
castle
with
a
whole
skin
and
should
very
readily
have
reconciled
myself
to
any
measure
which
would
have
restored
me
even
to
the
comforts
and
conveniences
of
a
cockpit
all
human
enjoyment
is
comparative
and
nothing
ever
convinced
me
of
it
so
much
and
so
forcibly
as
what
took
place
at
this
memorable
siege
fortune
and
the
well
known
cowardice
of
the
spaniards
released
me
from
this
jeopardy
they
surrendered
the
citadel
after
which
the
castle
was
of
no
use
and
we
ran
down
to
our
boats
as
fast
as
we
could
and
notwithstanding
the
very
assiduous
fire
of
the
watchful
on
the
hill
we
all
got
on
board
without
accident
there
was
one
very
singular
feature
in
this
affair
the
swiss
mercenaries
in
the
french
and
spanish
services
opposed
to
each
other
behaved
with
the
greatest
bravery
and
did
their
duty
with
unexceeded
fidelity
but
being
posted
so
near
and
coming
so
often
in
contact
with
each
other
they
would
cry
truce
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
they
made
inquiries
after
their
mutual
friends
often
recognizing
each
other
as
fathers
and
sons
brothers
and
near
relatives
fighting
on
opposite
sides
they
would
laugh
and
joke
with
each
other
declare
the
truce
at
an
end
then
load
their
muskets
and
take
aim
with
the
same
indifference
as
regarded
the
object
as
if
they
had
been
perfect
strangers
but
as
i
before
observed
fighting
is
a
trade
from
rosas
we
proceeded
to
join
the
admiral
off
toulon
and
being
informed
that
a
battery
of
six
brass
guns
in
the
port
of
silva
would
be
in
possession
of
the
french
in
a
few
hours
we
ran
in
and
anchored
within
of
it
we
lashed
blocks
to
our
lower
rove
hawsers
through
them
sent
the
ends
on
shore
made
them
fast
to
the
guns
and
hove
off
three
of
them
one
after
another
by
the
capstan
and
had
the
end
of
the
hawser
on
shore
ready
for
the
others
when
our
marine
videttes
were
surprised
by
the
french
driven
in
and
retreated
to
the
beach
with
the
loss
of
one
man
taken
prisoner
not
having
sufficient
force
on
shore
to
resist
them
we
our
party
and
the
french
taking
up
a
position
behind
the
rocks
commenced
a
heavy
fire
of
musketry
upon
us
we
answered
it
with
the
same
and
now
and
then
gave
them
a
great
gun
but
they
had
the
advantage
of
position
and
wounded
ten
or
eleven
of
our
men
from
their
elevated
stations
behind
the
rocks
at
sunset
this
ceased
when
a
boat
came
off
from
the
shore
pulled
by
one
spaniard
he
brought
a
letter
for
the
captain
from
the
officer
commanding
the
french
detachment
it
presented
the
french
captain
compliments
to
ours
regretted
the
little
interruption
he
had
given
to
our
occupation
remarked
that
the
weather
was
cold
and
as
he
had
been
ordered
off
in
a
hurry
he
had
not
had
time
to
provide
himself
and
as
there
was
always
a
proper
feeling
among
requested
a
few
gallons
of
rum
for
himself
and
followers
this
request
was
answered
with
a
and
the
spirits
required
the
british
captain
hoped
the
commandant
and
his
party
would
make
themselves
comfortable
and
have
a
the
captain
however
intended
the
frenchman
should
pay
for
the
spirits
though
not
in
money
and
sent
in
the
bill
about
one
in
the
morning
all
at
that
hour
was
as
still
as
death
the
french
guard
had
refreshed
themselves
and
were
enjoying
the
full
extent
of
our
benefaction
when
he
observed
to
us
that
it
was
a
pity
to
lose
the
boat
which
was
left
on
shore
as
well
as
the
other
brass
guns
and
proposed
making
the
attempt
to
bring
off
both
five
or
six
of
us
stripped
and
lowering
ourselves
into
the
water
very
gently
swam
ashore
in
a
breathless
kind
of
silence
that
would
have
done
honour
to
a
pawnee
loup
indian
the
water
was
very
cold
and
at
first
almost
took
away
my
respiration
we
landed
under
the
battery
and
having
first
secured
our
boat
without
noise
we
crept
softly
up
to
where
the
end
of
the
hawsers
lay
by
the
side
of
the
guns
to
which
we
instantly
made
them
fast
about
a
dozen
french
soldiers
were
lying
near
keeping
watch
fast
asleep
we
might
easily
have
killed
them
all
but
as
we
considered
they
were
under
the
influence
of
our
rum
we
abhorred
such
a
violation
of
hospitality
we
helped
ourselves
however
to
most
of
the
muskets
that
were
near
us
and
very
quietly
getting
into
the
boat
put
off
and
rowed
with
two
oars
to
the
ship
the
noise
of
the
oars
woke
some
of
the
soldiers
who
jumping
up
fired
at
us
with
all
the
arms
they
had
left
and
i
believe
soon
got
a
reinforcement
for
they
fired
both
quick
and
well
and
as
it
was
starlight
and
we
were
naked
our
bodies
were
easily
seen
so
that
the
shot
came
very
thick
about
us
diving
said
i
is
not
running
away
so
over
we
all
went
except
two
i
was
down
like
a
porpoise
never
rising
till
my
head
touched
the
ship
copper
i
swam
round
the
stern
and
was
taken
in
on
the
side
opposite
the
enemy
my
captain
i
daresay
would
have
disdained
such
a
compromise
but
though
i
was
as
proud
as
he
was
i
always
thought
with
falstaff
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valour
especially
in
a
midshipman
the
men
left
in
the
boat
got
safe
on
board
with
her
the
hands
were
all
ready
and
the
moment
our
oars
splashed
in
the
water
they
hove
round
cheerfully
and
the
guns
came
galloping
down
the
rocks
like
young
kangaroos
they
were
soon
under
water
and
long
before
the
frenchmen
could
get
a
cut
at
the
hawsers
they
then
fired
at
them
with
their
muskets
in
hopes
of
stranding
the
rope
but
they
failed
in
that
also
we
secured
the
guns
on
board
and
before
daylight
got
under
weigh
and
made
sail
for
the
fleet
which
we
joined
shortly
afterwards
i
here
learned
that
my
own
ship
had
fought
a
gallant
action
with
an
enemy
frigate
had
taken
her
opponent
but
had
suffered
so
much
that
she
was
ordered
home
for
repairs
and
had
sailed
for
england
from
gibraltar
i
had
letters
of
introduction
to
the
who
was
second
in
command
and
i
thought
under
these
circumstances
the
best
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
clean
myself
as
the
phrase
used
to
be
in
those
days
and
go
on
board
and
present
them
i
went
accordingly
and
saw
the
who
took
my
letters
in
to
the
admiral
and
brought
out
a
verbal
and
not
a
very
civil
message
saying
i
might
join
the
ship
if
i
pleased
until
my
own
returned
to
the
station
as
it
happened
to
suit
my
convenience
i
please
and
the
manner
in
which
the
favour
was
conferred
disburdened
my
mind
of
any
incumbrance
of
gratitude
the
reception
was
not
such
as
i
might
have
expected
had
the
letters
not
been
from
people
of
distinction
and
friends
of
the
i
should
much
have
preferred
remaining
in
the
frigate
whose
captain
also
wished
it
but
that
was
not
allowed
to
the
therefore
i
came
and
why
i
was
brought
here
i
never
could
discover
unless
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
completing
a
menagerie
for
i
found
between
sixty
and
seventy
midshipmen
already
assembled
they
were
mostly
youngsters
followers
of
the
and
had
seen
very
little
if
any
service
and
i
had
seen
a
great
deal
for
the
time
i
had
been
afloat
listening
eagerly
to
my
yarns
the
youthful
ardour
of
these
striplings
kindled
and
they
longed
to
emulate
my
deeds
the
consequence
was
numerous
applications
from
the
midshipmen
to
be
allowed
to
join
the
frigates
on
the
station
not
one
was
contented
in
the
and
the
captain
having
discovered
that
i
was
the
tarantula
which
had
bitten
them
hated
me
accordingly
and
not
a
jot
more
than
i
hated
him
the
captain
was
a
very
large
man
with
a
eye
a
pair
of
thick
lips
and
a
very
unmeaning
countenance
he
wore
a
large
pair
of
epaulettes
he
was
irritable
in
his
temper
and
when
roused
which
was
frequent
was
always
violent
and
overbearing
his
voice
was
like
thunder
and
when
he
launched
out
on
the
poor
midshipmen
they
reminded
me
of
the
trembling
bird
which
when
fascinated
by
the
eye
of
the
snake
loses
its
powers
and
falls
at
once
into
the
jaws
of
the
monster
when
much
excited
he
had
a
custom
of
shaking
his
shoulders
up
and
down
and
his
epaulettes
on
these
occasions
flapped
like
the
huge
ears
of
a
trotting
elephant
at
the
most
distant
view
of
his
person
or
sound
of
his
voice
every
midshipman
not
obliged
to
remain
fled
like
the
on
a
west
india
beach
he
was
incessantly
taunting
me
was
sure
to
find
some
fault
or
other
with
me
and
sneeringly
called
me
one
of
your
frigate
midshipmen
irritated
by
this
unjust
treatment
i
one
day
answered
that
i
a
frigate
midshipman
and
hoped
i
could
do
my
duty
as
well
as
any
midshipman
of
my
own
standing
in
the
service
for
this
injudicious
and
rather
impertinent
remark
i
was
ordered
aft
on
the
and
the
captain
went
in
to
the
admiral
and
asked
permission
to
flog
me
but
the
admiral
refused
observing
that
he
did
not
admire
the
system
of
flogging
young
gentlemen
and
moreover
that
in
the
present
instance
he
saw
no
reason
for
it
so
i
escaped
but
i
led
a
sad
life
of
it
and
often
did
i
pray
for
the
return
of
my
own
ship
among
other
exercises
of
the
fleet
we
used
always
to
reef
topsails
at
sunset
and
this
was
usually
done
by
all
the
ships
at
the
same
moment
waiting
the
signal
from
the
admiral
to
begin
in
this
exercise
there
was
much
foolish
rivalry
and
very
serious
accidents
as
well
as
numerous
punishments
took
place
in
consequence
of
one
ship
trying
to
excel
another
on
these
occasions
our
captain
would
bellow
and
foam
at
the
mouth
like
a
mad
bull
up
and
down
the
one
fine
evening
the
signal
was
made
the
topsails
lowered
and
the
men
laying
out
on
the
yards
when
a
poor
fellow
from
the
yard
fell
in
his
trying
to
lay
out
and
striking
his
shoulder
against
the
main
channels
broke
his
arm
i
saw
he
was
disabled
and
could
not
swim
and
perceiving
him
sinking
i
darted
overboard
and
held
him
until
a
boat
came
and
picked
us
up
as
the
water
was
smooth
and
there
was
little
wind
and
the
ship
not
going
more
than
two
miles
an
hour
i
incurred
little
risk
when
i
came
on
deck
i
found
the
captain
fit
for
bedlam
because
the
accident
had
delayed
the
topsails
going
to
the
quite
as
quick
as
the
rest
of
the
fleet
he
threatened
to
flog
the
man
for
falling
overboard
and
ordered
me
off
the
this
was
great
injustice
to
both
of
us
of
all
the
characters
i
ever
met
with
holding
so
high
a
rank
in
the
service
this
man
was
the
most
unpleasant
shortly
after
we
were
ordered
to
minorca
to
refit
here
to
my
great
joy
i
found
my
own
ship
and
i
shook
the
dust
off
my
feet
and
quitted
the
flag
with
a
light
heart
during
the
time
i
had
been
on
board
the
admiral
had
never
said
how
do
ye
do
to
me
nor
did
he
say
when
i
quitted
indeed
i
should
have
left
the
ship
without
ever
having
been
honoured
with
his
notice
if
it
had
not
happened
that
a
favourite
pointer
of
his
was
a
shipmate
of
mine
i
recollect
hearing
of
a
man
who
boasted
that
the
king
had
spoken
to
him
and
when
it
was
asked
what
he
had
said
replied
he
desired
me
to
get
out
of
his
way
my
intercourse
with
the
admiral
was
about
as
friendly
and
flattering
pompey
and
i
were
on
the
poop
i
presented
him
with
a
piece
of
hide
to
gnaw
by
way
of
pastime
the
admiral
came
on
the
poop
and
seeing
pompey
thus
employed
asked
who
gave
him
that
piece
of
hide
the
yeoman
of
the
signals
said
it
was
me
the
admiral
shook
his
long
at
me
and
said
by
g
sir
if
ever
you
give
pompey
a
bit
of
hide
again
i
will
flog
you
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
of
the
admiral
and
all
the
admiral
ever
said
to
me
chapter
viii
since
laws
were
made
for
every
degree
i
wonder
we
have
better
company
on
tyburn
tree
while
i
was
on
board
of
this
ship
two
poor
men
were
executed
for
mutiny
the
scene
was
far
more
solemn
to
me
than
anything
i
had
ever
beheld
indeed
it
was
the
first
thing
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
been
present
at
when
we
hear
of
executions
on
shore
we
are
always
prepared
to
read
of
some
foul
atrocious
crime
some
unprovoked
and
unmitigated
offence
against
the
laws
of
civilized
society
which
a
just
and
merciful
government
can
not
allow
to
pass
unpunished
with
us
at
sea
there
are
many
shades
of
difference
but
that
which
the
law
of
our
service
considers
a
serious
offence
is
often
no
more
than
an
ebullition
of
local
and
temporary
feeling
which
in
some
cases
might
be
curbed
and
in
others
totally
suppressed
by
timely
firmness
and
conciliation
the
ships
had
been
a
long
time
at
sea
the
enemy
did
not
appear
and
there
was
no
chance
either
of
bringing
him
to
action
or
of
returning
into
port
indeed
nothing
can
be
more
dull
and
monotonous
than
a
blockading
cruise
in
the
team
as
we
call
it
that
is
the
ships
of
the
line
stationed
to
watch
an
enemy
the
frigates
have
in
this
respect
every
advantage
they
are
always
employed
on
shore
often
in
action
and
the
more
men
they
have
killed
the
happier
are
the
survivors
some
melancholy
ferment
on
board
of
the
i
was
in
caused
an
open
mutiny
of
course
it
was
very
soon
quelled
and
the
ringleaders
having
been
tried
by
a
two
of
them
were
condemned
to
be
hanged
at
the
of
their
own
ship
and
were
ordered
for
execution
the
following
day
but
one
our
are
always
arrayed
in
the
most
pompous
manner
and
certainly
are
calculated
to
strike
the
mind
with
awe
even
of
a
captain
himself
a
gun
is
fired
at
eight
in
the
morning
from
the
ship
where
it
is
to
be
held
and
a

the

as

read
the
sentence
the
prisoners
are
delivered
to
the
custody
of
the
by
a
warrant
from
the
president
and
he
has
charge
of
them
till
the
time
for
the
execution
of
the
sentence
about
three
in
the
afternoon
i
received
a
message
from
one
of
the
prisoners
saying
he
wished
much
to
speak
with
me
i
followed
the
down
to
the
screened
cabin
in
the
where
the
men
were
confined
with
their
legs
in
irons
these
irons
consist
of
one
long
bar
and
a
set
of
shackles
the
shackles
fit
the
small
part
of
the
leg
just
above
the
ankle
and
having
an
eye
on
each
end
of
them
they
receive
the
leg
the
end
of
the
bar
is
then
passed
through
and
secured
with
a
padlock
i
found
the
poor
fellows
sitting
on
a
their
little
meal
lay
before
them
untouched
one
of
them
cried
bitterly
the
other
a
man
of
the
name
of
strange
possessed
a
great
deal
of
equanimity
although
evidently
deeply
affected
this
man
had
been
pretty
well
educated
in
youth
but
having
taken
a
wild
and
indolent
turn
had
got
into
mischief
and
to
save
himself
from
a
severe
chastisement
had
run
away
from
his
friends
and
entered
on
board
a
in
this
situation
he
had
found
time
in
the
intervals
of
duty
to
read
and
to
think
he
became
in
time
sullen
and
separated
himself
from
the
occasional
merriment
of
his
messmates
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
this
moody
temper
had
given
rise
to
the
mutinous
acts
for
which
he
was
to
suffer
this
man
now
apologized
for
the
liberty
he
had
taken
and
said
he
would
not
detain
me
long
you
see
sir
said
he
that
my
poor
friend
is
quite
overcome
with
the
horror
of
his
situation
nor
do
i
wonder
at
it
he
is
very
different
from
the
hardened
malefactors
that
are
executed
on
shore
we
are
neither
of
us
afraid
to
die
but
such
a
death
as
this
mr
mildmay
to
be
hung
up
like
dogs
an
example
to
the
fleet
and
a
shame
and
reproach
to
our
friends
this
wrings
our
hearts
it
is
this
consideration
and
to
save
the
feelings
of
my
poor
mother
that
i
have
sent
for
you
i
saw
you
jump
overboard
to
save
a
poor
fellow
from
drowning
so
i
thought
you
would
not
mind
doing
a
good
turn
for
another
unfortunate
sailor
i
have
made
my
will
and
appointed
you
my
executor
and
with
this
power
of
attorney
you
will
receive
all
my
pay
and
which
i
will
thank
you
to
give
to
my
dear
mother
whose
address
you
will
find
written
here
my
motive
for
this
is
that
she
may
never
learn
the
history
of
my
death
you
can
tell
her
that
i
died
for
my
country
good
which
is
very
true
for
i
acknowledge
the
justice
of
my
sentence
and
own
that
a
severe
example
is
wanting
it
is
eleven
years
since
i
was
in
england
i
have
served
faithfully
the
whole
of
that
time
nor
did
i
ever
misbehave
except
in
this
one
instance
i
think
if
our
good
king
knew
my
sad
story
he
would
be
merciful
but
god
will
be
done
yet
if
i
had
a
wish
it
would
be
that
the
enemy
fleet
would
come
out
and
that
i
might
die
as
i
have
lived
defending
my
country
but
mr
mildmay
i
have
one
very
important
question
to
ask
you
do
you
believe
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
future
state
most
surely
said
i
though
we
all
live
as
if
we
believed
there
was
no
such
thing
but
why
do
you
doubt
it
because
said
the
poor
fellow
when
i
was
an
officer
servant
i
was
one
day
tending
the
table
in
the
and
i
heard
the
commander
of
a
sloop
of
war
who
was
dining
there
with
his
son
say
that
it
was
all
nonsense
that
there
was
no
future
state
and
the
bible
was
a
heap
of
lies
i
have
never
been
happy
since
i
told
him
that
i
was
extremely
sorry
that
any
officer
should
have
used
such
expressions
at
all
particularly
before
him
that
i
was
incapable
of
restoring
his
mind
to
its
proper
state
but
that
i
should
recommend
his
immediately
sending
for
the
chaplain
who
i
had
no
doubt
would
give
him
all
the
comfort
he
could
desire
he
thanked
me
for
this
advice
and
profited
by
it
as
he
assured
me
in
his
last
moments
and
now
sir
said
he
let
me
give
a
piece
of
advice
when
you
are
a
captain
as
i
am
very
sure
you
will
be
do
not
worry
your
men
into
mutiny
by
making
what
is
called
a
smart
ship
cleanliness
and
good
order
are
what
seamen
like
but
niggling
polishing
scraping
iron
bars
and
and
the
like
of
that
a
sailor
dislikes
more
than
a
flogging
at
the
gangway
if
in
reefing
topsails
you
happen
to
be
a
minute
later
than
another
ship
never
mind
it
so
long
as
your
sails
are
well
reefed
and
fit
to
stand
blowing
weather
many
a
sail
is
split
by
bad
reefing
and
many
a
good
sailor
has
lost
his
life
by
that
foolish
hurry
which
has
done
incredible
harm
in
the
navy
what
can
be
more
cruel
or
unjust
than
to
flog
the
last
man
off
the
yard
seeing
that
he
is
necessarily
the
most
active
and
can
not
get
in
without
the
imminent
danger
of
breaking
his
neck
and
moreover
that
one
man
be
last
depend
upon
it
sir
nothing
is
well
done
which
is
done
in
a
hurry
but
i
have
kept
you
too
long
god
bless
you
sir
remember
my
poor
mother
and
be
sure
you
meet
me
on
the
forecastle
morning
the
fatal
morning
came
it
was
eight
the
gun
fired
the
signal
for
punishment
flew
at
our
the
poor
men
gave
a
deep
groan
exclaiming
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
our
earthly
career
and
troubles
are
nearly
over
the
came
in
unlocked
the
padlock
at
the
end
of
the
bars
and
slipping
off
the
shackles
desired
the
marine
sentinels
to
conduct
the
prisoners
to
the
here
was
a
scene
of
solemnity
which
i
hardly
dare
attempt
to
describe
the
day
was
clear
and
beautiful
the
yards
were
crossed
on
board
of
all
the
ships
the
colours
were
flying
the
crews
were
all
dressed
in
white
trousers
and
blue
jackets
and
hung
in
clusters
like
bees
on
the
side
of
the
rigging
facing
our
ship
a
guard
of
marines
under
arms
was
placed
along
each
gangway
but
on
board
of
our
ship
they
were
on
the
two
boats
from
each
ship
lay
off
upon
their
oars
alongside
of
us
with
a
lieutenant
and
a
corporal
guard
in
each
with
fixed
bayonets
the
hands
were
all
turned
up
by
the
boatswain
and
his
mates
with
a
shrill
whistle
and
calling
down
each
hatchway
all
hands
attend
punishment
you
now
heard
the
quick
trampling
of
feet
up
the
ladders
but
not
a
word
was
spoken
the
prisoners
stood
on
the
middle
of
the
while
the
captain
read
the
sentence
of
the
and
the
order
from
the
for
the
execution
the
appropriate
prayers
and
psalms
having
been
read
by
the
chaplain
with
much
feeling
and
devotion
the
poor
men
were
asked
if
they
were
ready
they
both
replied
in
the
affirmative
but
each
requested
to
have
a
glass
of
wine
which
was
instantly
brought
they
drank
it
off
bowing
most
respectfully
to
the
captain
and
officers
the
admiral
did
not
appear
it
not
being
etiquette
but
the
prisoners
desired
to
be
kindly
and
gratefully
remembered
to
him
they
then
begged
to
shake
hands
with
the
captain
and
all
the
officers
which
having
done
they
asked
permission
to
address
the
ship
company
the
captain
ordered
them
all
to
come
aft
on
the
top
and
the
most
profound
silence
reigned
and
there
was
not
an
eye
but
had
a
tear
in
it
william
strange
the
man
who
had
sent
for
me
then
said
in
a
clear
and
audible
tone
of
voice
brother
sailors
attend
to
the
last
words
of
a
dying
man
we
are
brought
here
at
the
instigation
of
some
of
you
who
are
now
standing
in
safety
among
the
crowd
you
have
made
fools
of
us
and
we
are
become
the
victims
to
the
just
vengeance
of
the
laws
had
you
succeeded
in
the
infamous
design
you
contemplated
what
would
have
been
the
consequences
ruin
eternal
ruin
to
yourselves
and
to
your
families
a
disgrace
to
your
country
and
the
scorn
of
those
foreigners
to
whom
you
proposed
delivering
up
the
ship
thank
god
you
did
not
succeed
let
our
fate
be
a
warning
to
you
and
endeavour
to
show
by
your
future
acts
your
deep
contrition
for
the
past
now
sir
turning
to
the
captain
we
are
ready
this
beautiful
speech
from
the
mouth
of
a
common
sailor
must
as
much
astonish
the
reader
as
it
then
did
the
captain
and
officers
of
the
ship
but
strange
as
i
have
shown
was
no
common
man
he
had
had
the
advantage
of
education
and
like
many
of
the
ringleaders
at
the
mutiny
of
the
nore
was
led
into
the
error
of
refusing
to
from
the
conscious
feeling
that
he
was
born
to
the
arms
of
the
prisoners
were
then
pinioned
and
the
chaplain
led
the
way
reading
the
funeral
service
the
with
two
marine
sentinels
conducted
them
along
the
starboard
gangway
to
the
forecastle
here
a
stage
was
erected
on
either
side
over
the
cathead
with
steps
to
ascend
to
it
a
tail
block
was
attached
to
the
at
the
outer
extremity
of
each
and
through
this
a
rope
was
rove
one
end
of
which
came
down
to
the
stage
the
other
was
led
along
the
yard
into
the
catharpings
and
thence
down
upon
the
a
gun
was
primed
and
ready
to
fire
on
the
fore
part
of
the
ship
directly
beneath
the
scaffold
i
attended
poor
strange
to
the
very
last
moment
he
begged
me
to
see
that
the
halter
which
was
a
piece
of
line
like
a
clothes
line
was
properly
made
fast
round
his
neck
for
he
had
known
men
suffer
dreadfully
from
the
want
of
this
precaution
a
white
cap
was
placed
on
the
head
of
each
man
and
when
both
mounted
the
platform
the
cap
was
drawn
over
their
eyes
they
shook
hands
with
me
with
their
messmates
and
with
the
chaplain
assuring
him
that
they
died
happy
and
confident
in
the
hopes
of
redemption
they
then
stood
still
while
the
yard
ropes
were
fixed
to
the
halter
by
a
toggle
in
the
running
noose
of
the
latter
the
other
end
of
the
were
held
by
some
twenty
or
thirty
men
on
each
side
of
the
where
two
lieutenants
of
the
ship
attended
all
being
ready
the
captain
waved
a
white
handkerchief
the
gun
fired
and
in
an
instant
the
poor
fellows
were
seen
swinging
at
either
they
had
on
blue
jackets
and
white
trousers
and
were
remarkably
young
men
they
did
not
appear
to
suffer
any
pain
and
at
the
expiration
of
an
hour
the
bodies
were
lowered
down
placed
in
coffins
and
sent
on
shore
for
interment
on
my
arrival
in
england
nine
months
after
i
acquitted
myself
of
my
promise
and
paid
to
the
mother
of
william
strange
upwards
of
fifty
pounds
for
pay
and
i
told
the
poor
woman
that
her
son
had
died
a
christian
and
had
fallen
for
the
good
of
his
country
and
having
said
this
i
took
a
hasty
leave
for
fear
she
should
ask
questions
that
the
execution
of
a
man
on
board
of
a
ship
of
war
does
not
always
produce
a
proper
effect
upon
the
minds
of
the
younger
boys
the
following
fact
may
serve
to
prove
there
were
two
little
fellows
on
board
the
ship
one
was
the
son
of
the
carpenter
the
other
of
the
boatswain
they
were
both
of
them
surprised
and
interested
at
the
sight
but
not
proportionably
shocked
the
next
day
i
was
down
in
one
of
the
wings
reading
by
the
light
of
a
purser
dip
a
farthing
candle
when
these
two
boys
came
sliding
down
the
main
hatchway
by
one
of
the
cables
whether
they
saw
me
and
thought
i
would
not
or
whether
they
supposed
i
was
asleep
i
can
not
tell
but
they
took
their
seats
on
the
cables
in
the
heart
of
the
tier
and
for
some
time
appeared
to
be
in
earnest
conversation
they
had
some
articles
folded
up
in
a
dirty
check
shirt
and
they
looked
up
at
the
battens
to
which
the
hammocks
are
suspended
and
producing
a
long
tried
to
pass
it
over
one
of
them
but
unable
to
reach
one
boy
climbed
on
the
back
of
the
other
and
effected
two
purposes
by
reeving
one
end
of
the
line
and
bringing
it
down
to
the
cables
again
they
next
unrolled
the
shirt
and
to
my
surprise
took
out
the
boatswain
kitten
about
three
months
old
its
fore
paws
were
tied
behind
its
back
its
hind
feet
were
tied
together
and
a
attached
to
them
a
piece
of
white
rag
was
tied
over
its
head
as
a
cap
it
was
now
pretty
evident
what
the
fate
of
poor
puss
was
likely
to
be
and
why
the
lead
was
made
fast
to
her
feet
the
was
tied
round
her
neck
they
each
shook
one
of
her
paws
and
pretended
to
cry
one
of
the
urchins
held
in
his
hand
a
fife
into
which
he
poured
as
much
flour
as
it
would
hold
out
of
the
handkerchief
the
other
held
the
end
of
the
every
ceremony
was
gone
through
that
they
could
think
of
are
you
ready
said
the
executioner
or
he
that
held
the
line
all
ready
replied
the
boy
with
the
fife
fire
the
gun
said
the
hangman
the
boy
applied
one
end
of
the
fife
to
his
mouth
blew
out
all
the
flour
and
in
this
humble
imitation
of
the
smoke
of
a
gun
poor
puss
was
run
up
to
the
batten
where
she
hung
till
she
was
dead
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
did
not
attempt
to
save
the
kitten
life
although
i
caused
her
foul
murder
to
be
revenged
by
the
after
the
body
had
hung
a
certain
time
they
took
it
down
and
buried
it
in
the
this
was
an
indictable
offence
as
the
smell
would
have
proved
so
i
lodged
the
information
the
body
was
found
and
as
the
facts
were
clear
the
law
took
its
course
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
bystanders
who
saw
the
brats
tied
upon
a
gun
and
well
flogged
the
boatswain
ate
the
kitten
first
he
said
because
he
had
to
eat
cats
in
spain
secondly
because
she
had
died
a
natural
death
i
thought
otherwise
and
his
last
reason
was
more
singular
than
either
of
the
others
he
had
seen
a
picture
in
a
church
in
spain
of
peter
vision
of
the
animals
let
down
in
the
sheet
and
there
was
a
cat
among
them
observing
an
alarm
of
scepticism
in
my
eye
he
thought
proper
to
confirm
his
assertion
with
an
oath
might
it
not
have
been
a
rabbit
said
i
rabbit
sir
d
n
me
think
i
did
know
a
cat
from
a
rabbit
why
one
has
got
short
ears
and
long
tail
and
has
got
as
we
calls
it
a
grand
carnival
masquerade
was
to
be
given
at
minorca
in
honour
of
the
english
and
the
place
chosen
for
the
exhibition
was
a
church
all
which
was
perfectly
consistent
with
the
romish
faith
i
went
in
the
character
of
a
fool
and
met
many
brother
officers
there
it
was
a
comical
sight
to
see
the
anomalous
groups
stared
at
by
the
pictures
of
the
virgin
mary
and
all
the
saints
whose
shrines
were
lit
up
for
the
occasion
with
wax
tapers
the
admiral
and
most
of
the
captains
and
officers
of
the
fleet
were
present
the
place
was
about
a
mile
from
the
town
having
hired
a
fool
dress
i
mounted
that
very
appropriate
animal
a
donkey
and
set
off
amidst
the
shouts
of
a
thousand
dirty
vagabonds
on
my
arrival
i
began
to
show
off
in
somersaults
leaps
and
all
kinds
of
practical
jokes
the
manner
in
which
i
supported
the
character
drew
a
little
crowd
around
me
i
never
spoke
to
an
admiral
or
captain
unless
he
addressed
me
first
and
then
i
generally
sold
him
a
bargain
being
very
well
acquainted
with
the
domestic
economy
of
the
ships
on
the
station
a
martinet
asked
me
if
i
would
enter
for
his
ship
no
said
i
you
would
give
me
three
dozen
for
not
lashing
up
my
hammock
properly
come
with
me
said
another
no
said
i
your
is
too
short
you
can
not
reach
it
to
order
another
bottle
of
wine
before
all
the
officers
have
left
your
table
another
promised
me
kind
treatment
and
plenty
of
wine
no
said
i
in
your
ship
i
should
be
coals
at
newcastle
besides
your
coffee
is
too
weak
your
steward
only
puts
one
ounce
into
six
cups
these
hits
afforded
a
good
deal
of
mirth
among
the
crowd
and
even
the
admiral
himself
honoured
me
with
a
smile
i
bowed
respectfully
to
his
lordship
who
merely
said
what
do
you
want
of
me
fool
oh
nothing
at
all
my
lord
said
i
i
have
only
a
small
favour
to
ask
of
you
what
is
that
said
the
admiral
only
to
make
me
a
captain
my
lord
oh
no
said
the
admiral
we
never
make
fools
captains
no
said
i
clapping
my
arms
akimbo
in
a
very
impertinent
manner
then
that
i
suppose
is
a
new
regulation
how
long
has
the
order
in
council
been
out
the
old
chief
laughed
heartily
at
this
piece
of
impertinence
but
the
captain
whose
ship
i
had
so
recently
quitted
was
silly
enough
to
be
offended
he
found
me
out
and
went
and
complained
of
me
to
my
captain
the
next
day
but
my
captain
only
laughed
at
him
said
he
thought
it
an
excellent
joke
and
invited
me
to
dinner
our
ship
was
ordered
to
gibraltar
where
we
arrived
soon
after
and
a
packet
coming
in
from
england
i
received
letters
from
my
father
announcing
the
death
of
my
dearest
mother
o
how
i
then
regretted
all
the
sorrows
i
had
ever
caused
her
how
incessantly
did
busy
memory
haunt
me
with
all
my
misdeeds
and
recall
to
mind
the
last
moment
i
had
seen
her
i
never
supposed
i
could
have
regretted
her
half
so
much
my
father
stated
that
in
her
last
moments
she
had
expressed
the
greatest
solicitude
for
my
welfare
she
feared
the
career
of
life
on
which
i
had
entered
would
not
conduce
to
my
eternal
welfare
however
much
it
might
promise
to
my
temporal
advantage
her
dying
injunctions
to
me
were
never
to
forget
the
moral
and
religious
principles
in
which
she
had
brought
me
up
and
with
her
last
blessing
implored
me
to
read
my
bible
and
take
it
as
my
guide
through
life
my
father
letter
was
both
an
affecting
and
forcible
appeal
and
never
in
the
whole
course
of
my
subsequent
life
were
my
feelings
so
worked
upon
as
they
were
on
that
occasion
i
went
to
my
hammock
with
an
aching
head
and
an
almost
broken
heart
a
retrospection
of
my
life
afforded
me
no
comfort
the
numerous
acts
of
depravity
or
pride
of
revenge
or
deceit
of
which
i
had
been
guilty
rushed
through
my
mind
as
the
tempest
through
the
rigging
and
called
me
to
the
most
serious
and
melancholy
reflections
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
collect
my
thoughts
and
analyse
my
feelings
but
when
i
recalled
all
my
misdeeds
my
departure
from
that
path
of
virtue
so
often
and
so
clearly
laid
down
by
my
affectionate
parent
i
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
shame
and
repentance
i
considered
how
often
i
had
been
on
the
brink
of
eternity
and
had
i
been
cut
off
in
my
sins
what
would
have
been
my
destiny
i
started
with
horror
at
the
dangers
i
had
escaped
and
looked
forward
with
gloomy
apprehension
at
those
that
still
awaited
me
i
sought
in
vain
among
all
my
actions
since
i
left
my
mother
care
one
single
deed
of
virtue
one
that
sprang
from
a
good
motive
there
was
it
is
true
an
outward
gloss
and
polish
for
the
world
to
look
at
but
all
was
dark
within
and
i
felt
that
a
keener
eye
than
that
of
mortality
was
searching
my
soul
where
deception
was
worse
than
useless
at
twelve
before
i
had
once
closed
my
eyes
i
was
called
to
relieve
the
deck
having
what
is
called
the
middle
watch
from
midnight
till
four
in
the
morning
we
had
the
day
before
buried
a
quid
an
old
seaman
who
had
destroyed
himself
by
drinking
no
very
uncommon
case
in
his
majesty
service
the
corpse
of
a
man
who
has
destroyed
his
inside
by
intemperance
is
generally
in
a
state
of
putridity
immediately
after
death
and
the
decay
particularly
in
warm
climates
is
very
rapid
a
few
hours
after
quid
death
the
body
emitted
certain
effluvia
denoting
the
necessity
of
immediate
interment
it
was
accordingly
sewn
up
in
a
hammock
and
as
the
ship
lay
in
deep
water
with
a
current
sweeping
round
the
bay
and
the
boats
being
at
the
same
time
all
employed
at
the
dockyard
the
first
lieutenant
caused
shot
to
be
tied
to
the
feet
and
having
read
the
funeral
service
launched
the
body
overboard
from
the
gangway
as
the
ship
lay
at
anchor
i
was
walking
the
deck
in
no
very
happy
state
of
mind
reflecting
seriously
on
parts
of
that
bible
which
for
more
than
two
years
i
had
never
looked
into
when
my
thoughts
were
called
to
the
summons
which
poor
quid
had
received
and
the
beauty
of
the
funeral
service
which
i
had
heard
read
over
him
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
the
moon
which
had
been
obscured
suddenly
burst
from
a
cloud
and
a
cry
of
horror
proceeded
from
the
man
on
the
starboard
gangway
i
ran
to
inquire
the
cause
and
found
him
in
such
a
state
of
nervous
agitation
that
he
could
only
say
quid
quid
and
point
with
his
finger
into
the
water
i
looked
over
the
side
and
to
my
amazement
there
was
the
body
of
quid
all
in
dreary
hammock
shrouded
perfectly
upright
and
floating
with
the
head
and
shoulders
above
water
a
slight
undulation
of
the
waves
gave
it
the
appearance
of
nodding
its
head
while
the
rays
of
the
moon
enabled
us
to
trace
the
remainder
of
the
body
underneath
the
surface
for
a
few
moments
i
felt
a
horror
which
i
can
not
describe
and
contemplated
the
object
in
awful
silence
while
my
blood
ran
cold
and
i
felt
a
sensation
as
if
my
hair
was
standing
on
end
i
was
completely
taken
by
surprise
and
thought
the
body
had
risen
up
to
warn
me
but
in
a
few
seconds
i
regained
my
presence
of
mind
and
i
soon
perceived
the
origin
of
this
reappearance
of
the
corpse
i
ordered
the
cutter
to
be
manned
and
in
the
meantime
went
down
to
inform
the
first
lieutenant
of
what
had
occurred
he
laughed
and
said
i
suppose
the
old
boy
finds
salt
water
not
quite
so
palatable
as
grog
tie
some
more
shot
to
his
feet
and
bring
the
old
fellow
to
his
moorings
again
tell
him
the
next
time
he
trips
his
anchor
not
to
run
on
board
of
us
he
had
his
regular
allowance
of
prayer
i
gave
him
the
whole
service
and
i
shall
not
give
him
any
more
so
saying
he
went
to
sleep
again
this
apparently
singular
circumstance
is
easily
accounted
for
bodies
decomposing
from
putridity
generate
a
quantity
of
gas
which
swells
them
up
to
an
enormous
size
and
renders
them
buoyant
the
body
of
this
man
was
thrown
overboard
just
as
decomposition
was
in
progress
the
shot
made
fast
to
the
feet
were
sufficient
to
sink
it
at
the
time
but
in
a
few
hours
after
were
not
competent
to
keep
it
at
the
bottom
and
it
came
up
to
the
surface
in
that
perpendicular
position
which
i
have
described
the
current
in
the
bay
being
at
the
time
either
slack
or
irregular
it
floated
at
the
spot
whence
it
had
been
launched
into
the
water
the
cutter
being
manned
was
sent
with
more
shot
to
attach
to
the
body
and
sink
it
when
they
attempted
to
hold
it
with
the
it
eluded
the
touch
turning
round
and
round
or
bobbing
under
the
water
and
coming
up
again
as
if
in
sport
but
accident
saved
them
any
further
trouble
for
the
bowman
reproached
by
the
boat
crew
for
not
hooking
the
body
got
angry
and
darting
the
spike
of
the
into
the
abdomen
the
gas
escaped
with
a
loud
whiz
and
the
corpse
instantly
sank
like
a
stone
many
jokes
were
passed
on
the
occasion
but
i
was
not
in
humour
for
joking
on
serious
subjects
and
before
the
watch
was
out
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
go
home
and
to
quit
the
service
as
i
found
i
had
no
chance
of
obeying
my
dying
injunctions
if
i
remained
where
i
was
the
next
morning
i
stated
my
wishes
to
the
captain
not
of
quitting
the
service
but
of
going
home
in
consequence
of
family
arrangements
this
was
about
as
necessary
as
that
i
should
make
a
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
the
captain
had
been
told
of
the
unpleasant
news
i
had
received
and
having
listened
to
all
i
had
to
say
he
replied
that
if
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
remain
with
him
it
would
be
better
for
me
you
are
now
said
he
accustomed
to
my
ways
you
know
your
duty
and
do
your
work
well
indeed
i
have
made
honourable
mention
of
you
to
the
admiralty
in
my
public
letter
you
know
your
own
business
best
here
he
was
mistaken
he
ought
not
to
have
parted
with
me
for
the
reasons
which
i
offered
but
my
advice
to
you
is
to
stay
i
thanked
him
but
being
bent
and
determined
on
going
home
he
acceded
to
my
request
gave
me
my
discharge
and
added
a
very
handsome
certificate
of
good
conduct
far
beyond
the
usually
prescribed
form
he
also
told
me
that
if
i
chose
to
return
to
him
he
would
keep
a
vacancy
for
me
i
parted
with
the
officers
my
messmates
and
the
ship
company
with
regret
i
had
been
more
than
three
years
with
them
and
my
stormy
commencement
had
settled
down
into
a
quiet
and
peaceful
acknowledgment
of
my
supremacy
in
the
berth
my
qualities
were
such
as
to
make
me
a
universal
favourite
and
i
was
followed
down
the
ship
side
with
the
hearty
good
wishes
of
all
i
was
pulled
in
the
cutter
on
board
of
a
ship
of
the
line
in
which
i
was
ordered
to
take
my
passage
to
england
chapter
ix
how
happy
could
i
be
with
either
were
dear
charmer
away
hell
they
say
is
paved
with
good
intentions
if
so
it
has
a
much
better
pavement
than
it
deserves
for
the
trail
of
the
serpent
is
over
us
all
then
why
send
to
hell
the
greatest
proof
of
our
perfection
before
the
fall
and
of
weakness
subsequent
to
it
honest
and
sincere
professions
of
amendment
must
carry
with
them
to
the
throne
of
grace
a
strong
recommendation
even
if
we
are
again
led
astray
by
the
allurements
of
sense
and
the
snares
of
the
world
at
least
our
tears
of
contrition
and
repentance
our
sorrow
for
the
past
and
our
firm
resolves
for
the
future
must
have
given
joy
in
heaven
and
consequently
can
not
have
been
converted
into
pavement
for
the
infernal
regions
pleasure
and
pain
in
youth
are
for
the
most
part
transient
impressions
whether
they
arise
from
possession
or
loss
of
worldly
enjoyment
or
from
a
sense
of
having
done
well
or
ill
in
our
career
the
excitement
though
strong
is
not
durable
and
thus
it
was
with
me
i
had
not
been
more
than
four
days
on
board
the
ship
of
the
line
in
which
i
took
my
passage
to
england
when
i
felt
my
spirits
buoyant
and
my
levity
almost
amounting
to
delirium
the
hours
of
reflection
were
at
first
shortened
and
then
dismissed
entirely
the
general
mirth
of
my
new
shipmates
at
the
thoughts
of
once
more
revisiting
their
dear
native
land
the
anticipation
of
indulging
in
the
sensual
worship
of
bacchus
and
venus
the
constant
theme
of
discourse
among
the
midshipmen
the
loud
and
senseless
applause
bestowed
on
the
coarsest
ribaldry
these
all
had
their
share
in
destroying
that
religious
frame
of
mind
in
which
i
had
parted
with
my
first
captain
and
seemed
to
awaken
me
to
a
sense
of
the
folly
i
had
been
guilty
of
in
quitting
a
ship
where
i
was
not
only
at
the
head
of
my
mess
but
in
a
fair
way
for
promotion
i
considered
that
i
had
acted
the
part
of
a
madman
and
had
again
begun
to
renew
my
career
of
sin
and
of
folly
a
little
and
but
a
little
sobered
by
the
recent
event
we
arrived
in
england
after
the
usual
passage
from
the
rock
i
consented
to
pass
two
days
at
portsmouth
with
my
new
companions
to
revisit
our
old
haunts
and
to
commit
those
excesses
which
fools
and
knaves
applauded
and
partook
of
at
my
expense
leaving
me
full
leisure
to
repent
after
we
separated
i
however
did
muster
resolution
enough
to
pack
my
trunk
and
after
an
extravagant
supper
at
the
fountain
retired
to
bed
intoxicated
and
the
next
morning
with
an
aching
head
threw
myself
into
the
coach
and
drove
off
for
london
a
day
of
much
hilarity
is
generally
succeeded
by
one
of
depression
this
is
fair
and
natural
we
draw
too
largely
on
our
stock
and
squander
our
enjoyment
like
our
money
leaving
us
the
next
day
with
low
spirits
and
a
lower
purse
a
stupid
dejection
succeeded
the
boisterous
mirth
of
the
overnight
i
slumbered
in
a
corner
of
the
coach
till
about
one
when
we
reached
godalming
where
i
alighted
took
a
slight
refreshment
and
resumed
my
seat
as
we
drove
along
i
had
more
leisure
and
was
in
a
fitter
frame
of
mind
to
review
my
past
conduct
since
i
had
quitted
my
ship
at
gibraltar
my
as
usual
produced
no
satisfactory
results
i
perceived
that
the
example
of
bad
company
had
swept
away
every
trace
of
good
resolution
which
i
had
made
on
the
death
of
my
mother
i
saw
with
grief
that
i
had
no
dependence
on
myself
i
had
forgotten
all
my
good
intentions
and
the
firm
vows
of
amendment
with
which
i
had
bound
myself
and
had
yielded
to
the
first
temptation
which
came
in
my
way
in
vain
did
i
call
up
every
black
and
threatening
cloud
of
domestic
sorrow
which
was
to
meet
me
on
my
return
home
the
dreadful
vacuum
occasioned
by
my
mother
death
the
grief
of
my
father
my
brother
and
my
sisters
in
deep
mourning
and
the
couch
on
which
i
had
left
the
best
of
parents
when
i
turned
away
my
thoughtless
head
from
her
in
the
anguish
of
her
grief
i
renewed
my
promise
of
amendment
and
felt
some
secret
consolation
in
doing
so
when
i
arrived
at
my
father
door
the
servant
who
let
me
in
greeted
me
with
a
loud
and
hearty
welcome
i
ran
into
the
where
i
found
that
my
brother
and
sisters
had
a
party
of
children
to
spend
the
evening
with
them
they
were
dancing
to
the
music
of
a
piano
played
on
by
my
aunt
while
my
father
sat
in
his
in
high
this
was
a
very
different
scene
from
what
i
had
expected
i
was
prepared
for
a
sentimental
and
affecting
meeting
and
my
feelings
were
all
worked
up
to
their
full
bearing
for
the
occasion
judge
then
of
the
sudden
revulsion
in
my
mind
when
i
found
mirth
and
good
humour
where
i
expected
tears
and
lamentations
it
had
escaped
my
recollection
that
although
the
death
of
my
mother
was
an
event
new
to
me
it
had
happened
six
months
before
i
had
heard
of
it
and
consequently
with
them
grief
had
given
way
to
time
i
was
astonished
at
their
apparent
want
of
feeling
while
they
gazed
with
surprise
at
the
sight
of
me
and
the
symbols
of
woe
displayed
in
my
equipment
my
father
welcomed
me
with
surprise
asked
where
my
ship
was
and
what
had
brought
her
home
the
fact
was
that
in
my
sudden
determination
to
return
to
england
i
had
spared
myself
the
trouble
of
writing
to
make
known
my
intentions
and
indeed
if
i
had
written
i
should
have
arrived
as
soon
as
my
letter
unless
which
i
ought
to
have
done
i
had
written
on
my
arrival
at
portsmouth
instead
of
throwing
away
my
time
in
the
very
worst
species
of
dissipation
unable
therefore
in
the
presence
of
many
witnesses
to
give
my
father
that
explanation
which
he
had
a
right
to
expect
i
suffered
greatly
for
a
time
in
his
opinion
he
very
naturally
supposed
that
some
disgraceful
conduct
on
my
part
was
the
cause
of
my
sudden
return
his
brow
became
clouded
and
his
mind
seemed
occupied
with
deep
reflection
this
behaviour
of
my
father
together
with
the
continued
noisy
mirth
of
my
brother
and
sisters
gave
me
considerable
pain
i
felt
as
if
in
the
sad
news
of
my
mother
death
i
had
my
part
in
the
feeling
i
had
shown
and
the
sacrifice
i
had
made
in
quitting
my
ship
on
explaining
to
my
father
in
private
the
motives
of
my
conduct
i
was
not
successful
he
could
not
believe
that
my
mother
death
was
the
sole
cause
of
my
return
to
england
i
stood
many
firm
and
angry
interrogations
as
to
the
possible
good
which
could
accrue
to
me
by
quitting
my
ship
i
showed
him
the
captain
handsome
certificate
which
only
mortified
him
the
more
in
vain
did
i
plead
my
excess
of
feeling
he
replied
with
an
argument
that
i
feel
to
have
been
unanswerable
that
i
had
quitted
my
ship
when
on
the
very
pinnacle
of
favour
and
in
the
road
to
fortune
and
what
said
he
is
to
become
of
the
navy
and
the
country
if
every
officer
is
to
return
home
when
he
receives
the
news
of
the
death
of
a
relation
in
proportion
as
my
father
arguments
carried
conviction
they
did
away
at
the
same
time
all
the
good
impressions
of
my
mother
dying
injunction
if
her
death
was
a
matter
of
so
little
importance
her
last
words
were
equally
so
and
from
that
moment
i
ceased
to
think
of
either
my
father
treatment
of
me
was
now
very
different
from
what
it
had
ever
been
during
my
mother
lifetime
my
requests
were
harshly
refused
and
i
was
lectured
more
as
a
child
than
as
a
lad
of
who
had
seen
much
of
the
world
coldness
on
his
part
was
met
by
a
spirit
of
resistance
on
mine
pride
came
in
to
my
assistance
a
dispute
arose
one
evening
at
the
finale
of
which
i
gave
him
to
understand
that
if
i
could
not
live
quietly
under
his
roof
i
would
quit
it
he
calmly
recommended
me
to
do
so
little
supposing
that
i
should
have
taken
his
advice
i
left
the
room
banging
the
door
after
me
packed
up
a
few
changes
of
linen
and
took
my
departure
unperceived
by
any
one
with
my
bundle
on
my
shoulder
and
about
sixteen
shillings
in
my
pocket
here
was
a
great
mismanagement
on
the
part
of
my
father
and
still
greater
on
mine
he
was
anxious
to
get
me
afloat
again
and
i
had
no
sort
of
objection
to
going
but
his
impatience
and
my
pride
spoiled
all
reflection
soon
came
to
me
but
came
too
late
night
was
fast
approaching
i
had
no
house
over
my
head
and
my
exchequer
was
in
no
very
flourishing
condition
i
had
walked
six
miles
from
my
father
house
when
i
began
to
tire
it
became
dark
and
i
had
no
fixed
plan
a
gentleman
carriage
came
by
i
took
up
a
position
in
the
rear
of
it
and
had
ridden
four
miles
when
as
the
carriage
was
slowly
dragging
up
a
hill
i
was
discovered
by
the
parties
inside
and
the
postilion
who
had
dismounted
and
been
informed
of
it
saluted
me
with
two
or
three
smart
cuts
of
his
whip
intimating
that
i
was
of
no
use
but
rather
an
incumbrance
which
could
be
dispensed
with
my
readers
know
that
i
had
long
since
adopted
the
motto
of
our
northern
neighbours
so
waiting
very
quietly
till
the
driver
had
mounted
his
horses
at
the
top
of
the
hill
that
he
might
be
more
at
my
mercy
i
discharged
a
stone
at
his
head
which
caused
him
to
vacate
his
seat
and
fall
under
his
horse
belly
the
animals
frightened
at
his
fall
turned
short
round
to
the
right
or
they
would
have
gone
over
him
and
ran
furiously
down
the
hill
the
recovering
his
legs
followed
his
horses
without
bestowing
a
thought
on
the
author
of
the
mischief
and
i
made
all
the
haste
i
could
in
the
opposite
direction
perfectly
indifferent
as
to
the
fate
of
the
parties
inside
of
the
carriage
for
i
still
smarted
with
the
blows
i
had
received
fools
and
unkind
muttered
i
looking
back
as
they
disappeared
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
with
frightful
velocity
you
are
rightly
served
i
was
a
trespasser
is
true
but
a
civil
request
would
have
had
all
the
effect
you
required
that
of
inducing
me
to
get
down
but
a
whip
to
me
and
with
my
blood
still
boiling
at
the
recollection
i
hastily
pursued
my
journey
in
a
few
minutes
i
reached
the
little
town
of
the
lights
of
which
were
visible
at
the
time
the
horses
had
turned
down
the
hill
and
run
away
entering
the
first
inn
i
came
to
i
found
the
large
room
below
occupied
by
a
set
of
strolling
players
who
had
just
returned
from
a
successful
performance
of
romeo
and
juliet
and
from
the
excitement
among
them
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
their
success
had
been
fully
equal
to
their
expectations
they
were
fourteen
in
number
seated
round
a
table
not
indifferently
covered
with
the
good
things
of
this
life
they
were
clad
in
theatrical
costume
which
with
the
rapid
circulation
of
the
bottle
gave
the
whole
scene
an
air
of
romantic
freedom
calculated
to
interest
the
mind
of
a
thoughtless
midshipman
being
hungry
after
my
walk
i
determined
to
join
the
party
at
supper
which
being
a
was
easily
effected
one
of
the
actresses
a
sweet
little
creature
with
large
black
eyes
was
receiving
with
apparent
indifference
the
compliments
of
the
better
sort
of
bumpkins
and
young
farmers
of
the
neighbourhood
in
her
momentary
and
occasional
smiles
she
discovered
a
beautiful
set
of
small
white
teeth
but
when
she
resumed
her
pensive
attitude
i
was
sensible
of
an
enchanting
air
of
melancholy
which
deeply
interested
me
in
favour
of
this
poor
girl
who
was
evidently
in
a
lower
situation
in
life
than
that
for
which
she
had
been
educated
the
person
who
sat
nearest
to
her
vacated
his
seat
as
soon
as
he
found
his
attentions
were
thrown
away
i
instantly
took
possession
of
the
place
and
observing
the
greatest
respect
entered
at
once
into
conversation
with
her
whether
she
was
pleased
with
my
address
and
language
as
being
superior
to
what
she
was
usually
compelled
to
listen
to
or
whether
she
was
flattered
by
my
assiduous
attention
i
know
not
but
she
gradually
unbent
and
became
more
animated
showing
great
natural
talent
and
a
mind
so
that
i
was
every
moment
more
astonished
to
find
her
in
such
a
situation
our
conversation
had
lasted
a
considerable
time
and
i
had
just
made
a
remark
to
which
she
had
not
replied
apparently
struggling
with
concealed
emotion
when
we
were
interrupted
by
a
carriage
driving
up
to
the
door
and
cries
of
help
help
i
instantly
quitted
the
side
of
my
new
acquaintance
and
flew
to
answer
the
signal
of
distress
a
gentleman
in
the
carriage
was
supporting
a
young
lady
in
his
arms
to
all
appearance
lifeless
with
my
assistance
she
was
speedily
removed
into
the
house
and
conveyed
to
a
bedroom
a
surgeon
was
sent
for
but
none
was
to
be
had
the
only
practitioner
of
the
town
being
at
that
moment
gone
to
attend
one
of
those
cases
which
according
to
mr
malthus
are
much
too
frequent
for
the
good
of
the
country
i
discovered
that
the
carriage
had
been
overturned
and
that
the
young
lady
had
been
insensible
ever
since
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
i
knew
that
immediate
bleeding
was
absolutely
necessary
i
had
acquired
thus
much
of
surgical
knowledge
in
the
course
of
my
professional
duties
i
stated
my
opinion
to
the
gentleman
and
although
my
practice
had
been
very
slight
offered
my
services
to
perform
the
operation
this
offer
was
accepted
with
thanks
by
the
grateful
father
for
such
i
found
he
was
with
my
sharp
penknife
i
opened
a
vein
in
one
of
the
whitest
arms
i
ever
beheld
after
a
few
moments
chafing
the
blood
flowed
more
freely
the
pulse
indicated
returning
animation
a
pair
of
large
blue
eyes
opened
suddenly
upon
me
like
a
masked
battery
and
so
alarmingly
susceptible
was
i
of
the
tender
passion
that
i
quite
forgot
the
little
actress
whom
i
had
left
at
the
and
who
a
few
minutes
before
had
occupied
my
whole
thoughts
and
attention
having
succeeded
in
restoring
the
fair
patient
to
consciousness
i
prescribed
a
warm
bed
some
tea
and
careful
watching
my
orders
were
punctually
obeyed
i
then
quitted
the
apartment
of
my
patient
and
began
to
ruminate
over
the
hurried
and
singular
events
of
the
day
i
had
scarcely
had
time
to
decide
in
my
own
mind
on
the
respective
merits
of
my
two
rival
beauties
when
the
surgeon
arrived
and
being
ushered
into
the
declared
that
the
patient
had
been
treated
with
skill
and
that
in
all
probability
she
owed
her
life
to
my
presence
of
mind
but
give
me
leave
to
ask
said
the
doctor
addressing
the
father
how
the
accident
happened
the
gentleman
replied
that
a
scoundrel
having
got
up
behind
the
carriage
had
been
flogged
off
by
the
postilion
and
in
revenge
had
thrown
a
stone
which
knocked
the
driver
off
his
horse
they
took
fright
turned
round
and
ran
away
down
the
hill
towards
their
own
stables
and
after
running
five
miles
upset
the
carriage
against
a
post
by
which
accident
said
he
my
poor
daughter
was
nearly
killed
what
a
villain
said
the
doctor
villain
indeed
echoed
i
and
so
i
felt
i
was
i
turned
sick
at
the
thought
of
what
my
ungoverned
passion
had
done
and
my
regret
was
not
a
little
increased
by
the
charms
of
my
lovely
victim
but
i
soon
recovered
from
the
shock
particularly
when
i
saw
that
no
suspicion
attached
to
me
i
therefore
received
the
praises
of
the
father
and
the
doctor
with
a
becoming
modest
diffidence
and
with
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
from
the
grateful
parent
was
wished
a
good
night
and
retired
to
my
bed
as
i
stood
before
the
laying
my
watch
and
exhausted
purse
on
the
and
leisurely
untying
my
cravat
i
could
not
forbear
a
glance
of
approbation
at
what
i
thought
a
very
handsome
and
a
very
impudent
face
i
soliloquised
on
the
events
of
the
day
and
as
usual
found
the
very
much
against
me
this
then
sir
said
i
is
your
road
to
repentance
and
reform
you
insult
your
father
quit
his
house
get
up
like
a
vagabond
behind
a
carriage
are
flogged
off
break
the
ribs
of
an
honest
man
who
has
a
wife
and
family
to
support
out
of
his
hard
earnings
are
the
occasion
of
a
carriage
being
overturned
and
very
nearly
cause
the
death
of
an
amiable
girl
and
all
this
mischief
in
the
short
space
of
six
hours
not
to
say
a
word
of
your
intentions
towards
the
little
actress
which
i
presume
are
none
of
the
most
honourable
where
is
all
this
to
end
at
the
gallows
said
i
in
reply
to
myself
the
more
probably
too
as
my
finances
have
no
means
of
improvement
except
by
a
miracle
or
highway
robbery
i
am
in
love
with
two
girls
and
have
only
two
clean
shirts
consequently
there
is
no
proportion
between
the
demand
and
the
supply
with
this
medley
of
reflections
i
fell
asleep
i
was
awoke
early
by
the
swallows
twittering
at
the
windows
and
the
first
question
which
was
agitated
in
my
brain
was
what
account
i
should
give
of
myself
to
the
father
of
the
young
lady
when
interrogated
by
him
as
i
most
certainly
should
be
i
had
my
choice
between
truth
and
falsehood
the
latter
such
is
the
force
of
habit
i
think
carried
it
hollow
but
i
determined
to
leave
that
point
to
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
act
according
to
circumstances
my
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
chambermaid
who
tapping
at
my
door
said
she
came
to
tell
me
that
the
gentleman
that
to
the
young
lady
that
i
was
so
kind
to
was
waiting
breakfast
for
me
the
thought
of
sitting
at
table
with
the
dear
creature
whose
brains
i
had
so
nearly
spilled
upon
the
road
the
night
before
quite
overcame
me
and
leaving
the
fabric
of
my
history
to
chance
or
to
inspiration
i
darted
from
my
bedroom
to
the
parlour
where
the
stranger
awaited
me
he
received
me
with
great
cordiality
again
expressed
his
obligations
and
informed
me
that
his
name
was
somerville
of
i
had
some
faint
recollection
of
having
heard
the
name
mentioned
by
my
father
and
was
endeavouring
to
recall
to
mind
on
what
occasion
when
mr
somerville
interrupted
me
by
saying
that
he
hoped
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
the
name
of
the
young
gentleman
who
had
conferred
such
an
obligation
upon
him
i
answered
that
my
name
was
mildmay
for
i
had
no
time
to
tell
a
lie
i
should
be
happy
to
think
said
he
that
you
were
the
son
of
my
old
friend
and
mr
mildmay
of
but
that
can
not
well
be
said
he
for
he
had
only
two
sons
one
at
college
the
other
as
brave
a
sailor
as
ever
lived
and
now
in
the
mediterranean
but
perhaps
you
are
some
relation
of
his
he
had
just
concluded
this
speech
and
before
i
had
time
to
reply
to
it
the
door
opened
and
miss
somerville
entered
we
have
all
heard
a
great
deal
about
love
at
first
sight
but
i
contend
that
the
man
who
would
not
at
the
very
first
glimpse
of
emily
somerville
have
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
her
could
have
had
neither
heart
nor
soul
if
i
thought
her
lovely
when
she
lay
in
a
state
of
insensibility
what
did
i
think
of
her
when
her
form
had
assumed
its
wonted
animation
and
her
cheeks
their
natural
colour
to
describe
a
perfect
beauty
never
was
my
forte
i
can
only
say
that
miss
somerville
as
far
as
i
am
a
judge
united
in
her
person
all
the
component
parts
of
the
finest
specimen
of
her
sex
in
england
and
these
were
joined
in
such
harmony
by
the
skilful
hand
of
nature
that
i
was
ready
to
kneel
down
and
adore
her
as
she
extended
her
white
hand
to
me
and
thanked
me
for
my
kindness
i
was
so
taken
aback
with
the
sudden
appearance
and
address
of
this
beautiful
vision
that
i
knew
not
what
to
say
i
stammered
out
something
but
have
no
recollection
whether
it
was
french
or
english
i
lost
my
presence
of
mind
and
the
blushes
of
conscious
guilt
on
my
face
at
that
moment
might
have
been
mistaken
for
those
of
unsophisticated
innocence
that
these
external
demonstrations
are
often
confounded
and
that
such
was
the
case
on
the
present
occasion
there
can
be
no
doubt
my
embarrassment
was
ascribed
to
that
modesty
ever
attendant
on
real
worth
it
has
been
said
that
true
merit
blushes
at
being
discovered
but
i
have
lived
to
see
merit
that
could
not
blush
and
the
want
of
it
that
could
while
the
latter
has
marched
off
with
all
the
honours
due
to
the
former
the
blush
that
burned
on
my
cheek
at
that
moment
would
have
gone
far
to
have
condemned
a
criminal
at
the
old
bailey
but
in
the
countenance
of
a
handsome
young
man
was
received
as
the
unfailing
marks
of
a
pure
ingenuous
soul
i
had
been
too
long
at
school
to
be
ashamed
of
wearing
laurels
i
had
never
won
and
having
often
received
a
flogging
which
i
did
not
deserve
i
thought
myself
equally
well
entitled
to
any
advantages
which
the
chances
of
war
might
throw
in
my
way
so
having
set
my
tender
conscience
at
rest
i
sat
myself
down
between
my
new
mistress
and
her
father
and
made
a
most
delightful
breakfast
miss
somerville
although
declared
out
of
danger
by
the
doctor
was
still
languid
but
able
to
continue
her
journey
and
as
they
had
not
many
miles
further
to
go
mr
somerville
proposed
a
delay
of
an
hour
or
two
breakfast
ended
he
quitted
the
room
to
arrange
for
their
departure
and
i
found
myself
with
the
young
lady
during
this
short
absence
i
found
out
that
she
was
an
only
daughter
and
that
her
mother
was
dead
she
again
introduced
the
subject
of
my
family
name
and
i
found
also
that
before
mrs
somerville
death
my
father
had
been
on
terms
of
great
intimacy
with
emily
parents
i
had
not
replied
to
mr
somerville
question
a
similar
one
was
now
asked
by
his
daughter
and
so
closely
was
i
interrogated
by
her
coral
lips
and
searching
blue
eyes
that
i
could
not
tell
a
lie
it
would
have
been
a
horrid
aggravation
of
guilt
so
i
honestly
owned
that
i
was
the
son
of
her
father
friend
mr
mildmay
good
heaven
said
she
why
had
you
not
told
my
father
so
because
i
must
have
said
a
great
deal
more
besides
added
i
making
her
my
confidante
i
am
the
midshipman
whom
mr
somerville
supposes
to
be
in
the
mediterranean
and
i
ran
away
from
my
father
house
last
night
although
i
was
as
concise
as
possible
in
my
story
i
had
not
finished
before
mr
somerville
came
in
oh
papa
said
his
daughter
this
young
gentleman
is
frank
mildmay
after
all
i
gave
her
a
reproachful
glance
for
having
betrayed
my
secret
her
father
was
astonished
she
looked
confused
and
so
did
i
nothing
now
remained
for
me
but
an
open
and
candid
confession
taking
especial
care
however
to
conceal
the
part
i
had
acted
in
throwing
the
stone
mr
somerville
reproved
me
very
sharply
which
i
thought
was
taking
a
great
liberty
but
he
softened
it
down
by
adding
if
you
knew
how
dear
the
interests
of
your
family
are
to
me
you
would
not
be
surprised
at
my
assuming
the
tone
of
a
parent
i
looked
at
emily
and
pocketed
the
affront
and
frank
pursued
he
when
i
tell
you
that
although
the
distance
between
your
father
property
and
mine
has
in
some
measure
interrupted
our
long
intimacy
i
have
been
watching
your
career
in
the
service
with
interest
you
will
perhaps
take
my
advice
and
return
home
do
not
let
me
have
to
regret
that
one
to
whom
i
am
under
such
obligations
should
be
too
proud
to
acknowledge
a
fault
i
admire
a
high
spirit
in
a
good
cause
but
towards
a
parent
it
can
never
be
justified
it
may
be
unpleasant
to
you
but
i
will
prepare
the
way
by
writing
to
your
father
and
do
you
stay
here
till
you
hear
from
me
i
should
wish
for
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
hall
but
your
father
has
prior
claims
and
i
hardly
need
tell
you
that
once
restored
and
reconciled
to
him
i
expect
as
long
a
visit
as
you
can
afford
to
pay
me
think
on
what
i
have
said
and
in
the
meantime
as
i
daresay
your
finances
are
not
very
flourishing
thinks
i
you
are
a
witch
allow
me
to
leave
this
note
in
your
hands
this
part
of
his
request
was
much
more
readily
complied
with
than
the
other
he
left
the
room
as
he
said
to
pay
the
bill
but
i
believe
it
was
to
give
his
fair
daughter
an
opportunity
of
trying
the
effect
of
her
eloquence
on
my
proud
spirit
which
gave
no
great
promise
of
concession
a
few
minutes
with
did
more
than
both
the
fathers
could
have
effected
the
most
powerful
motive
to
submission
being
the
certainty
that
i
could
not
visit
at
her
father
house
until
a
reconciliation
had
taken
place
between
me
and
mine
i
therefore
told
her
that
at
her
solicitation
i
would
submit
to
any
liberal
terms
this
being
agreed
to
her
father
observed
that
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
shook
hands
with
me
and
led
his
lovely
daughter
away
whose
last
nod
and
parting
look
confirmed
all
my
good
resolutions
reader
whatever
you
may
think
of
the
trifling
incidents
of
the
last
hours
you
will
find
that
they
involved
consequences
of
vast
importance
to
the
writer
of
this
memoir
pride
induced
me
to
quit
my
father
house
revenge
stimulated
me
to
an
act
which
brought
the
heroine
of
this
story
on
the
stage
for
such
will
emily
somerville
prove
to
be
but
alas
by
what
fatal
infatuation
was
mr
somerville
induced
to
leave
me
my
own
master
at
an
inn
with
ten
pounds
in
my
pocket
instead
of
taking
me
with
him
to
his
own
residence
and
keeping
me
till
he
had
heard
from
my
father
the
wisest
men
often
err
in
points
which
at
first
appear
of
trivial
importance
but
which
prove
in
the
sequel
to
have
been
fraught
with
evil
left
to
myself
i
ruminated
for
some
time
on
what
had
occurred
and
the
beautiful
emily
somerville
having
vanished
from
my
sight
i
recollected
the
little
fascinating
actress
from
whom
i
had
so
suddenly
parted
on
the
preceding
night
still
i
must
say
that
i
was
so
much
occupied
with
the
charms
of
her
successor
that
i
sought
the
society
of
the
youthful
melpomene
more
with
a
view
to
beguile
the
time
than
from
any
serious
prepossession
i
found
her
in
the
large
room
where
they
were
all
assembled
she
received
me
as
a
friend
and
evinced
a
partiality
which
flattered
my
vanity
in
three
days
i
received
a
letter
from
mr
somerville
inclosing
one
from
my
father
whose
only
request
was
that
i
would
return
home
and
meet
him
as
if
nothing
unpleasant
had
occurred
this
i
determined
to
do
but
i
had
now
been
so
long
in
the
company
of
eugenia
for
that
was
the
actress
name
that
i
could
not
very
easily
part
with
her
in
fact
i
was
desperately
in
love
after
my
fashion
and
though
perhaps
i
could
not
with
truth
say
the
same
of
her
yet
that
she
was
partial
to
my
company
was
evident
i
had
obtained
from
her
the
history
of
her
life
which
in
the
following
chapter
i
shall
give
in
her
own
words
chapter
x
she
is
virtuous
though
bred
behind
the
scenes
and
whatever
pleasure
she
may
feel
in
seeing
herself
applauded
on
the
stage
she
would
much
rather
pass
for
a
modest
girl
than
for
a
good
my
father
said
eugenia
was
at
the
head
of
this
company
of
strolling
players
my
mother
was
a
young
lady
of
respectable
family
at
a
she
took
a
fancy
to
my
father
in
the
character
of
and
being
of
course
deservedly
forsaken
by
her
friends
became
a
prima
donna
i
was
the
only
fruits
of
this
connection
and
the
only
solace
of
my
mother
in
her
affliction
for
she
bitterly
repented
the
rash
step
she
had
taken
at
five
years
old
my
father
proposed
that
i
should
take
the
character
of
cupid
in
the
opera
of
telemaque
to
this
my
mother
strongly
objected
declaring
that
i
never
should
go
upon
the
stage
and
this
created
a
disunion
which
was
daily
embittered
by
my
unkind
treatment
both
of
my
mother
and
myself
i
never
left
her
side
for
fear
of
a
kick
which
i
was
sure
to
receive
when
i
had
not
her
protection
she
employed
all
her
spare
time
in
my
instruction
and
notwithstanding
the
folly
she
had
been
guilty
of
she
was
fully
competent
to
the
task
when
i
was
seven
years
old
a
relation
of
my
mother
died
and
bequeathed
fifteen
thousand
pounds
to
be
equally
divided
between
her
and
her
two
sisters
securing
my
mother
portion
in
such
a
manner
as
to
prevent
my
father
having
any
control
over
it
as
soon
as
my
mother
obtained
this
information
she
quitted
my
father
who
was
too
prudent
to
spend
either
his
time
or
his
money
in
pursuit
of
her
had
he
been
aware
of
her
sudden
change
of
fortune
he
might
have
acted
differently
we
arrived
in
london
took
possession
of
the
property
which
was
all
in
the
funds
and
then
fearing
my
father
might
gain
information
of
her
wealth
my
mother
set
off
for
france
taking
me
with
her
there
i
passed
the
happiest
days
of
my
life
my
mother
spared
no
pains
and
went
to
considerable
expense
in
my
education
the
best
masters
were
provided
for
me
in
singing
dancing
and
music
and
so
much
did
i
profit
by
their
instruction
that
i
was
very
soon
considered
a
pretty
specimen
of
my
countrywomen
and
much
noticed
accordingly
from
france
we
went
to
italy
where
we
remained
two
years
and
where
my
vocal
education
was
completed
my
poor
mother
lived
all
this
time
on
the
principal
of
her
fortune
concluding
it
would
last
for
ever
at
last
she
was
taken
ill
of
a
fever
and
died
this
was
about
a
year
ago
when
i
was
only
sixteen
delirious
many
days
before
her
death
she
could
give
me
no
instructions
as
to
my
future
conduct
or
where
to
apply
for
resources
i
happened
however
to
know
her
banker
in
london
and
wrote
to
him
immediately
in
answer
he
informed
me
that
a
balance
of
forty
pounds
was
all
that
remained
in
his
hands
i
believe
he
cheated
me
but
i
could
not
help
it
my
spirits
were
not
depressed
at
this
news
i
sold
all
the
furniture
paid
the
little
debts
to
the
tradespeople
and
with
nine
pounds
in
my
pocket
took
my
place
in
the
diligence
and
set
off
for
london
where
i
arrived
without
accident
i
read
in
the
newspaper
at
the
inn
that
a
provincial
company
was
in
want
of
a
young
actress
for
genteel
comedy
my
mother
original
passion
for
the
stage
had
never
left
her
and
during
our
stay
in
france
we
often
amused
ourselves
with
petite
in
which
i
always
took
a
part
without
resources
i
thought
a
precarious
mode
of
obtaining
a
livelihood
was
better
than
a
vicious
one
and
determined
to
try
my
fortune
on
the
stage
so
i
ordered
a
hack
and
drove
to
the
office
indicated
i
felt
a
degree
of
comfort
when
i
discovered
that
my
father
was
the
advertising
manager
although
i
was
certain
he
would
never
recognise
me
i
was
engaged
by
the
agent
the
bargain
was
approved
of
and
in
a
day
or
two
after
was
ordered
to
a
country
town
some
miles
from
the
metropolis
i
arrived
my
father
did
not
know
me
nor
did
i
wish
that
he
should
as
i
did
not
intend
to
remain
long
in
the
company
i
short
i
aspired
to
the
london
boards
but
aware
that
i
wanted
practice
without
which
it
would
have
been
useless
to
have
offered
myself
i
accepted
this
situation
without
delay
and
applied
with
great
assiduity
to
the
study
of
my
profession
my
father
i
found
had
married
again
and
my
joining
the
company
added
nothing
to
his
domestic
harmony
my
stepmother
becoming
immoderately
jealous
of
me
but
i
took
good
care
to
keep
my
own
secret
and
never
exposed
myself
for
one
moment
to
any
suspicion
of
my
character
which
hitherto
thank
heaven
has
been
pure
though
i
am
exposed
to
a
thousand
temptations
and
beset
by
the
actors
to
become
the
wife
of
one
or
the
mistress
of
another
among
those
who
proposed
the
latter
was
my
honoured
father
to
whom
on
that
account
i
was
one
day
on
the
point
of
revealing
the
secret
of
my
birth
as
the
only
means
of
saving
myself
from
his
importunities
he
was
at
last
taken
ill
and
died
only
three
months
ago
not
before
i
had
completed
my
engagements
and
obtained
an
increased
salary
of
one
guinea
and
a
half
per
week
it
is
my
intention
to
quit
the
company
at
the
expiration
of
my
present
term
which
will
take
place
in
two
months
for
i
am
miserable
here
although
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
know
what
will
be
my
future
destination
in
return
for
her
confidence
i
imparted
as
much
of
my
history
as
i
thought
it
necessary
for
her
to
know
i
became
deeply
fascinated
i
forgot
miss
somerville
and
answered
my
father
letter
respectfully
and
kindly
he
informed
me
that
he
had
procured
my
name
to
be
entered
on
the
books
of
the
at
spithead
but
that
i
might
gain
time
to
loiter
by
the
side
of
eugenia
i
begged
his
permission
to
join
my
ship
without
returning
home
alleging
as
a
reason
that
delay
would
soften
down
any
asperity
of
feeling
occasioned
by
the
late
fracas
this
in
his
answer
he
agreed
to
enclosing
a
handsome
remittance
and
the
same
post
brought
a
pressing
invitation
from
mr
somerville
to
come
to
hall
my
little
actress
informed
me
that
the
company
would
set
out
in
two
days
for
the
neighbourhood
of
portsmouth
and
as
i
found
that
they
would
be
more
than
a
fortnight
in
travelling
i
determined
to
accept
the
invitation
and
quit
her
for
the
present
i
had
been
more
than
a
week
in
her
society
at
parting
i
professed
my
admiration
and
love
silence
and
a
starting
tear
were
her
only
acknowledgment
i
saw
that
she
was
not
displeased
and
i
left
her
with
joyful
anticipations
but
what
did
i
anticipate
as
i
rolled
heedlessly
along
in
the
chaise
to
hall
sensual
gratification
at
the
expense
of
a
poor
defenceless
orphan
whose
future
life
would
be
clouded
with
misery
i
could
see
my
wickedness
and
moralise
upon
it
but
the
devil
was
triumphant
within
me
and
i
consoled
myself
with
the
vulgar
adage
needs
must
when
the
devil
drives
with
this
i
dismissed
the
subject
to
think
of
emily
whose
residence
was
now
in
sight
i
arrived
at
hall
was
kindly
received
and
welcomed
by
both
father
and
daughter
but
on
this
visit
i
must
not
dwell
when
i
reflect
on
it
i
hate
myself
and
human
nature
could
i
be
trusted
yet
i
inspired
unbounded
confidence
was
i
not
as
vicious
as
one
of
my
age
could
be
yet
i
made
them
believe
i
was
almost
perfection
did
i
deserve
to
be
happy
yet
i
was
so
and
more
so
than
i
had
ever
been
before
or
ever
have
been
since
i
was
like
the
serpent
in
eden
though
without
his
vile
intentions
beauty
and
virtue
united
to
keep
my
passions
in
subjection
when
they
had
nothing
to
feed
on
they
concealed
themselves
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
my
bosom
had
i
remained
always
with
emily
i
should
have
been
reclaimed
but
when
i
quitted
her
i
lost
all
my
good
feelings
and
good
resolutions
not
however
before
the
bright
image
of
virtue
had
lighted
up
in
my
bosom
a
holy
flame
which
has
never
been
entirely
extinguished
occasionally
dimmed
it
has
afterwards
burnt
up
with
renewed
brightness
and
as
a
has
often
guided
me
through
perils
that
might
have
overwhelmed
me
compelled
at
last
to
quit
this
earthly
paradise
i
told
her
at
parting
that
i
loved
her
adored
her
and
to
prove
that
i
was
in
earnest
and
that
she
believed
me
i
obtained
a
lock
of
her
hair
when
i
left
hall
it
was
my
intention
to
have
joined
my
ship
as
i
had
agreed
with
my
father
but
the
temptation
to
follow
up
my
success
with
the
fair
and
unfortunate
eugenia
was
too
strong
to
be
resisted
at
least
i
thought
so
and
therefore
hardly
made
an
effort
to
conquer
it
true
i
did
make
my
appearance
on
board
the
had
my
name
entered
on
the
books
that
i
might
not
lose
my
time
of
servitude
and
that
i
might
also
deceive
my
father
all
this
being
duly
accomplished
i
obtained
leave
of
absence
from
my
first
lieutenant
an
old
acquaintance
who
in
a
ship
crowded
with
supernumerary
midshipmen
was
but
too
happy
in
getting
rid
of
me
and
my
chest
i
hastened
to
the
rendezvous
and
found
the
company
in
full
activity
eugenia
when
we
parted
expressed
a
wish
that
our
acquaintance
might
not
be
renewed
she
feared
for
her
own
character
as
well
as
mine
and
very
sensibly
and
feelingly
observed
that
my
professional
prospects
might
be
blasted
but
having
made
up
my
mind
i
had
an
answer
for
all
her
objections
i
presented
myself
to
the
manager
and
requested
to
be
admitted
into
the
company
having
taken
this
step
eugenia
saw
that
my
attachment
was
not
to
be
overcome
that
i
was
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
her
i
was
accepted
my
salary
was
fixed
at
one
guinea
per
week
with
seven
shillings
extra
for
playing
the
flute
i
was
indebted
for
my
ready
admission
into
this
society
to
my
voice
the
manager
wanted
a
first
singer
my
talent
in
this
science
was
much
admired
i
signed
my
agreement
the
same
evening
for
two
months
and
being
presented
in
due
form
to
my
brethren
of
the
buskin
joined
the
where
there
was
more
of
abundance
than
of
delicacies
i
sat
by
eugenia
whose
decided
preference
for
me
excited
the
jealousy
of
my
new
associates
i
measured
them
all
with
my
eye
and
calculated
that
with
fair
play
i
was
the
best
man
among
them
the
announced
the
tragedy
of
romeo
and
juliet
i
was
to
be
the
hero
and
four
days
were
allowed
me
to
prepare
myself
the
whole
of
that
time
was
passed
in
the
company
of
eugenia
who
while
she
gave
me
unequivocal
proofs
of
attachment
admitted
of
no
freedom
the
day
of
rehearsal
arrived
i
was
found
perfect
and
loudly
applauded
by
the
company
six
came
the
curtain
rose
and
sixteen
tallow
candles
displayed
my
person
to
an
audience
of
about
one
hundred
people
no
one
who
has
not
been
in
the
situation
can
form
any
idea
of
the
nervous
feeling
of
a
on
such
an
occasion
the
troupe
with
the
exception
of
eugenia
was
of
a
description
of
persons
whom
i
despise
and
the
audience
mostly
clodhoppers
who
could
scarcely
read
or
write
yet
i
was
abashed
and
acquitted
myself
badly
until
the
balcony
scene
when
i
became
enlivened
and
invigorated
by
the
presence
and
smiles
of
my
mistress
in
the
art
of
i
was
at
home
particularly
with
the
juliet
of
that
night
i
entered
at
once
into
the
spirit
of
the
great
dramatist
and
the
curtain
dropped
amidst
thunders
of
applause
my
name
was
announced
for
a
repetition
of
the
play
and
i
was
dragged
forward
before
the
curtain
to
thank
the
grocers
cheesemongers
and
ploughmen
for
the
great
honour
they
had
done
me
heavens
how
i
felt
the
degradation
but
it
was
too
late
the
natural
result
of
this
constant
intercourse
with
eugenia
may
easily
be
anticipated
i
do
not
attempt
to
extenuate
my
fault
it
was
inexcusable
and
has
brought
its
punishment
but
for
poor
forlorn
eugenia
i
plead
her
virtue
fell
before
my
importunity
and
my
personal
appearance
she
fell
a
victim
to
those
unhappy
circumstances
of
which
i
basely
took
the
advantage
two
months
i
had
lived
with
her
as
man
and
wife
i
forgot
my
family
profession
and
even
emily
i
was
now
upon
the
ship
books
and
though
no
one
knew
anything
of
me
my
father
was
ignorant
of
my
absence
from
the
ship
everything
was
sacrificed
to
eugenia
i
acted
with
her
strolled
the
fields
and
vowed
volumes
of
stuff
about
constancy
when
we
played
we
filled
the
house
and
some
of
the
more
respectable
townspeople
offered
to
introduce
us
to
the
london
boards
but
this
we
both
declined
we
cared
for
nothing
but
the
society
of
each
other
and
now
that
time
has
cooled
the
youthful
ardour
that
carried
me
away
let
me
do
justice
to
this
unfortunate
girl
she
was
the
most
natural
unaffected
and
gifted
person
i
ever
met
with
boundless
wit
enchanting
liveliness
a
strong
mind
and
towards
me
the
first
and
i
firmly
believe
the
only
object
she
ever
loved
and
her
love
for
me
ceased
only
with
her
life
her
faults
though
not
to
be
defended
may
be
palliated
and
deplored
because
they
were
the
defects
of
education
her
infant
days
were
passed
in
scenes
of
domestic
strife
profligacy
and
penury
her
maturer
years
under
the
guidance
of
a
weak
mother
were
employed
in
polishing
not
strengthening
the
edifice
of
her
understanding
and
the
external
ornaments
only
served
to
accelerate
the
fall
of
the
fabric
and
to
increase
the
calamity
bred
up
in
france
and
almost
in
the
fervour
of
the
revolution
she
had
imbibed
some
of
its
libertine
opinions
among
others
that
marriage
was
a
civil
contract
and
if
entered
into
at
all
might
be
broken
at
the
pleasure
of
either
party
this
idea
was
strengthened
and
confirmed
in
her
by
the
instances
she
had
seen
of
matrimonial
discord
particularly
in
her
own
family
when
two
people
who
fancied
they
loved
had
bound
themselves
by
an
indissoluble
knot
they
felt
from
that
time
the
irksomeness
of
restraint
which
they
would
never
have
felt
if
they
had
possessed
the
power
of
separation
and
would
have
lived
happily
together
if
they
had
not
been
compelled
to
do
it
how
long
you
my
dear
frank
said
eugenia
to
me
one
day
may
continue
to
love
me
i
know
not
but
the
moment
you
cease
to
love
me
it
were
better
that
we
parted
these
were
certainly
the
sentiments
of
an
enthusiast
but
eugenia
lived
long
enough
to
acknowledge
her
error
and
to
bewail
its
fatal
effects
on
her
peace
of
mind
i
was
awoke
from
this
dream
of
happiness
by
a
curious
incident
i
thought
it
disastrous
at
the
time
but
am
now
convinced
that
it
was
fraught
with
good
since
it
brought
me
back
to
my
profession
recalled
me
to
a
sense
of
duty
and
showed
me
the
full
extent
of
my
disgraceful
situation
my
father
it
appears
was
still
ignorant
of
my
absence
from
my
ship
and
had
come
down
without
my
knowledge
on
a
visit
to
a
friend
in
the
neighbourhood
hearing
of
the
interesting
young
man
who
had
acquired
so
much
credit
in
the
character
of
apollo
as
well
as
of
romeo
he
was
persuaded
to
see
the
performance
i
was
in
the
act
of
singing
pray
goody
when
my
eyes
suddenly
met
those
of
my
papa
who
was
staring
like
the
head
of
gorgon
and
though
his
gaze
did
not
turn
me
to
stone
it
turned
me
sick
i
was
stupified
forgot
my
part
ran
off
and
left
the
manager
and
the
music
to
make
the
best
of
it
my
father
who
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
was
convinced
when
he
saw
my
confusion
i
ran
into
the
where
before
i
had
time
to
divest
myself
of
apollo
crown
and
petticoat
i
was
accosted
by
my
enraged
parent
and
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
describe
taking
my
costume
into
consideration
how
very
much
like
a
fool
i
looked
my
father
sternly
demanded
how
long
i
had
been
thus
honourably
employed
this
was
a
question
which
i
had
anticipated
and
therefore
very
readily
replied
only
two
or
three
days
that
i
had
left
portsmouth
for
what
we
called
a
lark
and
i
thought
it
very
amusing
very
amusing
indeed
sir
said
my
father
and
pray
may
i
venture
to
inquire
without
the
fear
of
having
a
lie
told
me
how
long
this
as
you
call
it
is
to
continue
oh
said
i
my
leave
expires
and
then
i
must
return
to
my
ship
allow
me
the
honour
of
keeping
your
company
said
my
father
and
i
shall
beg
your
captain
to
impose
some
little
restraint
as
to
time
and
distance
on
your
future
excursions
then
rising
in
his
tone
he
added
i
am
ashamed
of
you
sir
the
son
of
a
gentleman
is
not
likely
to
reap
any
advantage
from
the
society
of
strolling
vagabonds
and
prostitutes
i
had
reason
to
think
by
your
last
letters
from
portsmouth
that
you
were
very
differently
employed
to
this
very
sensible
and
parental
reproof
i
answered
with
a
demure
and
innocent
countenance
for
i
soon
regained
my
presence
of
mind
that
i
did
not
think
there
had
been
any
harm
in
doing
that
which
most
of
the
officers
of
the
navy
did
at
one
time
or
another
an
assertion
much
too
general
that
we
often
got
up
plays
on
board
of
ship
and
that
i
wanted
to
practise
practise
then
with
your
equals
said
my
father
not
in
company
with
rogues
and
i
felt
that
the
latter
name
was
meant
for
eugenia
and
was
very
indignant
but
fortunately
kept
all
my
anger
within
board
and
knowing
i
was
all
in
the
wrong
allowed
my
father
to
fire
away
without
returning
a
shot
he
concluded
his
lecture
by
commanding
me
to
call
upon
him
the
next
morning
at
ten
and
left
me
to
change
my
dress
and
to
regain
my
good
humour
i
need
not
add
that
i
did
not
return
to
the
stage
that
night
but
left
the
manager
to
make
his
peace
with
the
audience
in
any
way
he
thought
proper
when
i
informed
eugenia
of
the
evening
adventure
she
was
inconsolable
to
comfort
her
i
offered
to
give
up
my
family
and
my
profession
and
live
with
her
at
these
words
eugenia
suddenly
recollected
herself
frank
said
she
all
that
has
happened
is
right
we
are
both
wrong
i
felt
that
i
was
too
happy
and
shut
my
eyes
to
the
danger
i
dared
not
face
your
father
is
a
man
of
sense
his
object
is
to
reclaim
you
from
inevitable
ruin
as
for
me
if
he
knew
of
our
connection
he
could
only
despise
me
he
sees
his
son
living
with
strolling
players
and
it
is
his
duty
to
cut
the
chain
no
matter
by
what
means
you
have
an
honourable
and
distinguished
career
marked
out
for
you
i
will
never
be
an
obstacle
to
your
father
just
ambition
or
your
prosperity
i
did
hope
for
a
happier
destiny
but
love
blinded
my
eyes
i
am
now
undeceived
if
your
father
can
not
respect
me
he
shall
at
least
admire
the
resolution
of
the
unhappy
eugenia
i
have
tenderly
loved
you
my
dearest
frank
and
never
have
loved
any
other
nor
ever
shall
but
part
we
must
heaven
only
knows
for
how
long
a
time
i
am
ready
to
make
every
sacrifice
to
your
fame
and
character
the
only
proof
i
can
give
of
my
unbounded
love
for
you
i
embraced
her
as
she
uttered
these
words
and
we
spent
a
great
part
of
the
night
in
making
preparations
for
my
departure
arrangements
for
our
future
correspondence
and
if
possible
for
our
future
meetings
i
left
her
early
on
the
following
morning
and
with
a
heavy
i
had
almost
said
a
broken
heart
appeared
before
my
father
he
was
no
doubt
aware
of
my
attachment
and
the
violence
of
my
passions
and
prudently
endeavoured
to
soothe
them
he
received
me
affectionately
did
not
renew
the
subject
of
the
preceding
night
and
we
became
very
good
friends
in
tearing
myself
away
from
eugenia
i
found
the
truth
of
the
french
adage
que
la
première
pas
qui
my
heart
grew
lighter
as
i
increased
my
distance
from
her
my
father
to
detach
my
mind
still
more
from
the
unfortunate
subject
spoke
much
of
family
affairs
of
my
brother
and
sisters
and
lastly
named
mr
somerville
and
emily
here
he
touched
on
the
right
chord
the
remembrance
of
emily
revived
the
expiring
embers
of
virtue
and
the
recollection
of
the
pure
and
perfect
mistress
of
hall
for
a
time
dismissed
the
unhappy
eugenia
from
my
mind
i
told
my
father
that
i
would
engage
never
to
disgrace
him
or
myself
any
more
if
he
would
promise
not
to
name
my
late
folly
to
mr
somerville
or
his
daughter
that
said
my
father
i
promise
most
readily
and
with
the
greater
pleasure
since
i
see
in
your
request
the
strongest
proof
of
the
sense
of
your
error
this
conversation
passed
on
our
road
to
portsmouth
where
we
had
no
sooner
arrived
than
my
father
who
was
acquainted
with
the
left
me
at
the
george
while
he
crossed
the
street
to
call
on
him
the
result
of
this
interview
was
that
i
should
be
sent
out
immediately
in
some
ship
with
a
tight
captain
there
was
one
of
this
description
just
about
to
sail
for
basque
roads
and
at
the
admiral
particular
request
i
was
received
on
board
as
a
supernumerary
there
being
no
vacancies
in
the
ship
my
father
who
by
this
time
was
wide
awake
to
all
my
wiles
saw
me
on
board
and
then
flattering
himself
that
i
was
in
safe
custody
took
his
leave
and
returned
to
the
shore
i
very
soon
found
that
i
was
under
an
embargo
and
was
not
on
any
account
to
be
allowed
leave
of
absence
this
was
pretty
nearly
what
i
expected
but
i
had
my
own
resources
i
had
now
learned
to
laugh
at
trifles
and
i
cared
little
about
this
decided
step
which
his
prudence
induced
him
to
take
chapter
xi
our
boat
has
one
sail
and
the
helmsman
is
pale
a
bold
pilot
i
trow
who
should
follow
us
now
shouted
he
as
he
spoke
bolts
of
death
speck
their
path
the
sea
and
thou
and
thou
and
thou
and
thou
and
drive
we
not
free
the
terrible
sea
i
and
thou
shelley
the
reader
may
think
i
was
over
fastidious
when
i
inform
him
that
i
can
not
describe
the
disgust
i
felt
at
the
licentious
impurity
of
manners
which
i
found
in
the
midshipmen
berth
for
although
my
connection
with
eugenia
was
not
sanctioned
by
religion
or
morality
it
was
in
other
respects
pure
disinterested
and
if
i
may
use
the
expression
patriarchal
since
it
was
unsullied
by
inconstancy
gross
language
or
drunkenness
vicious
i
was
and
i
own
it
to
my
shame
but
at
least
my
vice
was
refined
by
eugenia
who
had
no
fault
but
one
as
soon
as
i
had
settled
myself
in
my
new
abode
with
all
the
comfort
that
circumstances
would
permit
i
wrote
a
long
letter
to
eugenia
in
which
i
gave
an
exact
account
of
all
that
had
passed
since
our
separation
i
begged
her
to
come
down
to
portsmouth
and
see
me
told
her
to
go
to
the
star
and
garter
as
the
house
nearest
the
and
consequently
where
i
should
be
the
soonest
out
of
sight
after
i
had
landed
her
answer
informed
me
that
she
should
be
there
on
the
following
day
the
only
difficulty
now
was
to
get
on
shore
no
eloquence
of
mine
i
was
sure
would
induce
the
first
lieutenant
to
relax
his
guard
over
me
i
tried
the
experiment
however
begged
very
hard
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
shore
to
procure
certain
articles
absolutely
necessary
to
my
comfort
no
no
said
mr
talbot
i
am
too
old
a
hand
to
be
caught
that
way
i
have
my
orders
and
i
would
not
let
my
father
go
on
shore
if
the
captain
ordered
me
to
keep
him
on
board
and
i
tell
you
in
perfect
good
humour
that
out
of
this
ship
you
do
not
go
unless
you
swim
on
shore
and
that
i
do
not
think
you
will
attempt
here
continued
he
to
prove
to
you
there
is
no
on
my
part
here
is
the
captain
note
it
was
short
sweet
and
complimentary
as
it
related
to
myself
and
was
as
follows
keep
that
d
d
young
scamp
mildmay
on
board
will
you
allow
me
then
said
i
folding
up
the
note
and
returning
it
to
him
without
any
comment
will
you
allow
me
to
go
on
shore
under
the
charge
of
the
sergeant
of
marines
that
said
he
would
be
just
as
much
an
infringement
of
my
orders
as
letting
you
go
by
yourself
you
can
not
go
on
shore
sir
these
last
words
he
uttered
in
a
very
peremptory
manner
and
quitting
the
deck
left
me
to
my
own
reflections
and
my
own
resources
intercourse
by
letter
between
eugenia
and
myself
was
perfectly
easy
but
that
was
not
all
i
wanted
i
had
promised
to
meet
her
at
nine
in
the
evening
it
was
now
sunset
the
boats
were
all
hoisted
up
no
shore
boat
was
near
and
there
was
no
mode
of
conveyance
but
la
which
mr
talbot
himself
had
suggested
only
as
proving
its
utter
impracticability
but
he
did
not
know
me
half
so
well
at
the
time
as
he
did
afterwards
the
ship
lay
two
miles
from
the
shore
the
wind
was
from
the
and
the
tide
moving
to
the
eastward
so
that
with
wind
and
tide
both
in
my
favour
i
calculated
on
fetching
south
sea
castle
after
dark
i
took
my
station
in
the
it
was
the
of
march
and
very
cold
i
undressed
myself
made
all
my
clothes
up
into
a
very
tight
bundle
and
fastened
them
on
my
hat
which
retained
its
proper
position
then
lowering
myself
very
gently
into
the
water
like
another
leander
i
struck
out
to
gain
the
arms
of
my
hero
before
i
had
got
twenty
yards
from
the
ship
i
was
perceived
by
the
sentinel
who
naturally
supposing
i
was
a
pressed
man
endeavouring
to
escape
hailed
me
to
come
back
not
being
obeyed
the
officer
of
the
watch
ordered
him
to
fire
at
me
a
ball
whizzed
over
my
head
and
struck
the
water
between
my
hands
a
dozen
more
followed
all
of
them
tolerably
well
directed
but
i
struck
out
and
the
friendly
shades
of
night
and
increasing
distance
from
the
ship
soon
protected
me
a
waterman
seeing
the
flashes
and
hearing
the
reports
of
the
muskets
concluded
that
he
might
chance
to
pick
up
a
fare
he
pulled
towards
me
i
hailed
him
and
he
took
me
in
before
i
had
got
half
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
ship
i
doubt
whether
you
would
ever
have
fetched
the
shore
on
that
tack
my
lad
said
the
old
man
you
left
your
ship
two
hours
too
soon
you
would
have
met
the
running
strong
out
of
the
harbour
and
the
first
thing
you
would
have
made
if
you
could
have
kept
up
your
head
above
water
would
have
been
the
ower
while
the
old
man
was
pulling
and
talking
i
was
shivering
and
dressing
and
made
no
reply
but
begged
him
to
put
me
on
shore
on
the
first
part
of
south
sea
beach
he
could
land
at
which
he
did
i
gave
him
a
guinea
and
ran
without
stopping
into
the
garrison
and
down
point
street
to
the
star
and
garter
where
i
was
received
by
eugenia
who
with
great
presence
of
mind
called
me
her
husband
in
the
hearing
of
the
people
of
the
house
my
wet
clothes
attracted
her
notice
i
told
her
what
i
had
done
to
obtain
an
interview
with
her
she
shuddered
with
horror
my
teeth
chattered
with
cold
a
good
fire
a
hot
and
not
very
weak
glass
of
together
with
her
tears
smiles
and
caresses
soon
restored
the
reader
will
no
doubt
here
recall
to
mind
the
less
agreeable
remedy
applied
to
me
when
i
ducked
the
usher
and
one
recommended
also
by
myself
in
similar
cases
as
having
experienced
its
good
effects
how
much
more
i
deserved
it
on
this
occasion
than
the
former
one
need
not
be
mentioned
so
sweet
was
this
stolen
interview
that
i
vowed
i
was
ready
to
encounter
the
same
danger
on
the
succeeding
night
our
conversation
turned
on
our
future
prospects
and
as
our
time
was
short
we
had
much
to
say
frank
said
the
poor
girl
before
we
meet
again
i
shall
probably
be
a
mother
and
this
hope
alone
alleviates
the
agony
of
separation
if
i
have
not
you
i
shall
at
least
be
blest
with
your
image
heaven
grant
that
it
may
be
a
boy
to
follow
the
steps
of
his
father
and
not
a
girl
to
be
as
wretched
as
her
mother
you
my
dear
frank
are
going
on
distant
and
dangerous
service
dangers
increased
tenfold
by
the
natural
ardour
of
your
mind
we
may
never
meet
again
or
if
we
do
the
period
will
be
far
distant
i
ever
have
been
and
ever
will
be
constant
to
you
till
death
but
i
neither
expect
nor
will
allow
of
the
same
declaration
on
your
part
other
scenes
new
faces
youthful
passions
will
combine
to
drive
me
for
a
time
from
your
thoughts
and
when
you
shall
have
attained
maturer
years
and
a
rank
in
the
navy
equal
to
your
merits
and
your
connections
you
will
marry
in
your
own
sphere
of
society
all
these
things
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
as
events
that
must
take
place
your
person
i
know
i
can
not
have
but
do
not
do
not
discard
me
from
your
mind
i
shall
never
be
jealous
as
long
as
i
know
you
are
happy
and
still
love
your
unfortunate
eugenia
your
child
shall
be
no
burthen
to
you
until
it
shall
have
attained
an
age
at
which
it
may
be
put
out
in
the
world
then
i
know
you
will
not
desert
it
for
the
sake
of
its
mother
dear
frank
my
heart
is
broken
but
you
are
not
to
blame
and
if
you
were
i
would
die
imploring
blessings
on
your
head
here
she
wept
bitterly
i
tried
every
means
in
my
power
to
comfort
and
encourage
this
fascinating
and
extraordinary
girl
i
forgot
neither
vows
nor
promises
which
at
the
time
i
fully
intended
to
perform
i
promised
her
a
speedy
and
i
trusted
a
happy
meeting
god
will
be
done
said
she
come
what
will
and
now
my
dearest
frank
farewell
never
again
endanger
your
life
and
character
for
me
as
you
did
last
night
i
have
been
blest
in
your
society
and
even
with
the
prospect
of
misery
before
me
can
not
regret
the
past
i
tenderly
embraced
her
jumped
into
a
wherry
at
point
and
desired
the
waterman
to
take
me
on
board
the
at
spithead
the
first
lieutenant
was
on
deck
when
i
came
up
the
side
i
presume
it
was
you
whom
we
fired
at
last
night
said
he
smiling
it
was
sir
said
i
absolute
necessity
compelled
me
to
go
on
shore
or
i
should
not
have
taken
such
an
extraordinary
mode
of
conveyance
oh
with
all
my
heart
said
the
officer
had
you
told
me
you
intended
to
have
swum
on
shore
i
should
not
have
prevented
you
i
took
you
for
one
of
the
pressed
men
and
directed
the
marines
to
fire
at
you
the
pressed
men
are
extremely
obliged
to
you
thought
i
did
you
not
find
it
devilish
cold
continued
the
lieutenant
in
a
strain
of
good
humour
which
i
encouraged
by
my
manner
of
answering
indeed
i
did
sir
said
i
and
the
jollies
fired
tolerably
well
did
they
they
did
sir
would
they
had
had
a
i
understand
you
said
the
lieutenant
but
as
you
have
not
served
your
time
the
vacancy
would
be
of
no
use
to
you
i
must
report
the
affair
to
the
captain
though
i
do
not
think
he
will
take
any
notice
of
it
he
is
too
fond
of
enterprise
himself
to
check
it
in
others
besides
a
lady
is
always
a
justifiable
object
but
we
hope
soon
to
show
you
some
higher
game
the
captain
came
on
board
shortly
after
and
took
no
notice
of
my
having
been
absent
without
leave
he
made
some
remark
as
he
glanced
his
eye
at
me
which
i
afterwards
learned
was
in
my
favour
in
a
few
days
we
sailed
and
arrived
in
a
few
more
in
basque
roads
the
british
fleet
was
at
anchor
outside
the
french
ships
moored
in
a
line
off
the
isle
the
ship
i
belonged
to
had
an
active
part
in
the
work
going
on
and
most
of
us
saw
more
than
we
chose
to
speak
of
but
as
much
was
made
on
that
occasion
and
one
or
two
very
unpleasant
took
place
i
shall
endeavour
to
confine
myself
to
my
own
personal
narrative
avoiding
anything
that
may
give
offence
to
the
parties
concerned
some
days
were
passed
in
preparing
the
and
on
the
night
of
the
april
everything
being
prepared
for
the
attempt
to
destroy
the
enemy
squadron
we
began
the
attack
a
more
daring
one
was
never
made
and
if
it
partly
failed
of
success
no
fault
could
be
imputed
to
those
who
conducted
the
enterprise
they
did
all
that
man
could
do
the
night
was
very
dark
and
it
blew
a
strong
breeze
directly
in
upon
the
isle
and
the
enemy
fleet
two
of
our
frigates
had
been
previously
so
placed
as
to
serve
as
beacons
to
direct
the
course
of
the
they
each
displayed
a
clear
and
brilliant
light
the
were
directed
to
pass
between
these
after
which
their
course
up
to
the
boom
which
guarded
the
anchorage
was
clear
and
not
easily
to
be
mistaken
i
solicited
and
obtained
permission
to
go
on
board
one
of
the
explosion
vessels
that
were
to
precede
the
they
were
filled
with
layers
of
shells
and
powder
heaped
one
upon
another
the
quantity
on
board
of
each
vessel
was
enormous
another
officer
three
seamen
and
myself
were
all
that
were
on
board
of
her
we
had
a
gig
a
small
narrow
thing
by
the
sailors
a
coffin
to
make
our
escape
in
being
quite
prepared
we
started
it
was
a
fearful
moment
the
wind
freshened
and
whistled
through
our
rigging
and
the
night
was
so
dark
that
we
could
not
see
our
bowsprit
we
had
only
our
foresail
set
but
with
a
strong
and
a
fair
wind
with
plenty
of
it
we
passed
between
the
advanced
frigates
like
an
arrow
it
seemed
to
me
like
entering
the
gates
of
hell
as
we
flew
rapidly
along
and
our
own
ships
disappeared
in
the
intense
darkness
i
thought
of
inscription
over
the
portals
you
who
enter
here
leave
hope
behind
our
orders
were
to
lay
the
vessel
on
the
boom
which
the
french
had
moored
to
the
outer
anchors
of
their
ships
of
the
line
in
a
few
minutes
after
passing
the
frigates
we
were
close
to
it
our
boat
was
towing
astern
with
three
men
in
it
one
to
hold
the
rope
ready
to
let
go
one
to
steer
and
one
to
bale
the
water
out
which
from
our
rapid
motion
would
otherwise
have
swamped
her
the
officer
who
accompanied
me
steered
the
vessel
and
i
held
the
match
in
my
hand
we
came
upon
the
boom
with
a
horrid
crash
he
put
the
helm
down
and
laid
her
broadside
to
it
the
force
of
the
tide
acting
on
the
hull
and
the
wind
upon
the
foresail
made
her
heel
gunwale
to
and
it
was
with
difficulty
i
could
keep
my
legs
at
this
moment
the
boat
was
very
near
being
swamped
alongside
they
had
shifted
her
astern
and
there
the
tide
had
almost
lifted
her
over
the
boom
by
great
exertion
they
got
her
clear
and
lay
upon
their
oars
the
tide
and
the
wind
formed
a
bubbling
short
sea
which
almost
buried
her
my
companion
then
got
into
the
boat
desiring
me
to
light
the
and
follow
if
ever
i
felt
the
sensation
of
fear
it
was
after
i
had
lighted
this
which
was
connected
with
the
train
until
i
was
fairly
in
the
boat
and
out
of
the
reach
of
the
explosion
which
was
inevitable
and
might
be
instantaneous
the
sensation
was
horrid
i
was
standing
on
a
mine
any
fault
in
the
which
sometimes
will
happen
any
trifling
quantity
of
gunpowder
lying
in
the
interstices
of
the
deck
would
have
exploded
the
whole
in
a
moment
had
my
hand
trembled
which
i
am
proud
to
say
it
did
not
the
same
might
have
occurred
only
one
minute
and
a
half
of
was
allowed
i
had
therefore
no
time
to
lose
the
moment
i
had
lit
it
i
laid
it
down
very
gently
and
then
jumped
into
the
gig
with
a
nimbleness
suitable
to
the
occasion
we
were
off
in
a
moment
i
pulled
the
stroke
oar
and
i
never
plied
with
more
zeal
in
all
my
life
we
were
not
two
hundred
yards
from
her
when
she
exploded
a
more
terrific
and
beautiful
sight
can
not
be
conceived
but
we
were
not
quite
enough
at
our
ease
to
enjoy
it
the
shells
flew
up
in
the
air
to
a
prodigious
height
some
bursting
as
they
rose
and
others
as
they
descended
the
shower
fell
about
us
but
we
escaped
without
injury
we
made
but
little
progress
against
the
wind
and
tide
and
we
had
the
pleasure
to
run
the
gauntlet
among
all
the
other
which
had
been
ignited
and
bore
down
on
us
in
flames
fore
and
aft
their
rigging
was
hung
with
congreve
rockets
and
as
they
took
fire
they
darted
through
the
air
in
every
direction
with
an
astounding
noise
looking
like
large
fiery
serpents
we
arrived
safely
on
board
and
reported
ourselves
to
the
captain
who
was
on
the
hammocks
watching
the
progress
of
the
one
of
these
had
been
lighted
too
soon
her
helm
had
not
been
lashed
and
she
had
broached
to
close
to
our
frigate
i
had
had
quite
enough
of
adventure
for
that
night
but
was
fated
to
have
a
little
more
mr
mildmay
said
the
captain
you
seem
to
like
the
fun
jump
into
your
gig
again
take
four
fresh
hands
thinks
i
a
fresh
midshipman
would
not
be
amiss
get
on
board
of
that
vessel
and
put
her
head
the
right
way
i
did
not
like
this
job
at
all
the
vessel
appeared
to
be
in
flames
from
the
to
the
topsail
and
i
own
i
preferred
enjoying
the
honours
i
had
already
gained
to
going
after
others
so
very
precarious
however
i
never
made
a
difficulty
and
this
was
no
time
for
exceptions
to
my
rule
i
touched
my
hat
said
ay
ay
sir
sang
out
for
four
volunteers
and
in
an
instant
i
had
fifty
i
selected
four
and
shoved
off
on
my
new
expedition
as
i
approached
the
vessel
i
could
not
at
first
discover
any
part
that
was
not
tenanted
by
the
flames
the
heat
of
which
at
the
distance
of
twenty
or
thirty
feet
was
far
from
pleasant
even
in
that
cold
night
the
weather
quarter
appeared
to
be
clearest
of
flames
but
they
burst
out
with
great
fury
from
the
cabin
windows
i
contrived
with
great
difficulty
to
reach
the
deck
by
climbing
up
that
part
which
was
not
actually
burning
and
was
followed
by
one
of
the
sailors
the
was
on
fire
and
the
flakes
of
burning
canvas
from
the
boom
mainsail
fell
on
us
like
a
the
end
of
the
tiller
was
burnt
to
charcoal
but
on
the
midship
part
of
it
i
passed
a
rope
and
assisted
by
the
sailor
moved
the
helm
and
got
her
before
the
wind
while
i
was
thus
employed
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
my
type
don
juan
i
was
nearly
suffocated
before
i
had
completed
my
work
i
shoved
off
again
and
away
she
flew
before
the
wind
i
do
go
with
you
this
time
said
i
as
the
frenchman
said
when
he
was
invited
to
an
english
foxhunt
i
was
as
black
as
a
negro
when
i
returned
on
board
and
dying
with
thirst
very
well
done
mildmay
said
the
captain
did
you
find
it
warm
i
pointed
to
my
mouth
for
it
was
so
parched
that
i
could
not
speak
and
ran
to
the
where
i
drank
as
much
as
would
have
floated
a
canoe
the
first
thing
i
said
as
soon
as
i
could
speak
was
d
that
and
the
lubber
that
set
her
on
fire
the
next
morning
the
french
squadron
was
seen
in
a
very
disastrous
state
they
had
cut
their
cables
and
run
on
shore
in
every
direction
with
the
exception
of
the
flag
ships
of
the
admiral
and
which
lay
at
their
anchors
and
could
not
move
till
high
water
it
was
then
first
quarter
flood
so
that
they
had
five
good
hours
to
remain
i
refer
my
readers
to
the
for
a
history
of
these
events
they
have
also
been
commented
on
with
more
or
less
severity
by
contemporary
writers
i
shall
only
observe
that
had
the
captains
of
his
majesty
ships
been
left
to
their
own
judgment
much
more
would
have
been
attempted
but
with
what
success
i
do
not
presume
to
say
my
captain
as
soon
as
he
could
see
his
mark
weighed
ran
in
and
engaged
the
batteries
while
he
also
directed
his
guns
at
the
bottoms
of
the
enemy
ships
as
they
lay
on
shore
on
their
beam
ends
isle
gave
us
a
warm
reception
i
was
on
the
forecastle
the
captain
of
which
had
his
head
taken
clean
off
by
a
the
captain
of
the
ship
coming
forward
at
the
same
moment
only
said
poor
fellow
throw
him
overboard
there
is
no
time
for
a
coroner
inquest
now
we
were
a
considerable
time
engaging
the
batteries
and
the
vessels
near
them
without
receiving
any
assistance
from
our
ships
while
this
was
going
on
a
very
curious
instance
of
muscular
action
occurred
a
lad
of
eighteen
years
of
age
was
on
the
forecastle
when
a
shot
cut
away
the
whole
of
his
bowels
which
were
scattered
over
another
midshipman
and
myself
and
nearly
blinded
us
he
fell
and
after
lying
a
few
seconds
sprang
suddenly
on
his
feet
stared
us
horribly
in
the
face
and
fell
down
dead
the
spine
had
not
been
divided
but
with
that
exception
the
lower
was
separated
from
the
upper
part
of
the
body
some
of
our
vessels
seeing
us
so
warmly
engaged
began
to
move
up
to
our
assistance
one
of
our
ships
of
the
line
came
into
action
in
such
gallant
trim
that
it
was
glorious
to
behold
she
was
a
beautiful
ship
in
what
we
call
high
kelter
she
seemed
a
living
body
conscious
of
her
own
superior
power
over
her
opponents
whose
shot
she
despised
as
they
fell
thick
and
fast
about
her
while
she
deliberately
took
up
an
admirable
position
for
battle
and
having
furled
her
sails
and
squared
her
yards
as
if
she
had
been
at
spithead
her
men
came
down
from
aloft
went
to
their
guns
and
opened
such
a
fire
on
the
enemy
ships
and
batteries
as
would
have
delighted
the
great
nelson
himself
could
he
have
been
present
the
results
of
this
action
are
well
known
and
do
not
need
repeating
here
it
was
one
of
the
scenes
of
the
war
the
french
slow
to
believe
their
naval
inferiority
now
submitted
in
silence
our
navy
had
done
its
work
and
from
that
time
the
brunt
of
the
war
fell
on
the
army
the
advocates
of
fatalism
or
predestination
might
adduce
a
strong
illustration
of
their
doctrine
as
evinced
in
the
death
of
the
captain
of
one
of
the
french
ships
destroyed
this
officer
had
been
taken
out
of
his
ship
by
one
of
the
boats
of
our
frigate
but
recollecting
that
he
had
left
on
board
nautical
instruments
of
great
value
he
requested
our
captain
to
go
with
him
in
the
gig
and
bring
them
away
before
the
ship
was
burned
they
did
go
and
the
boat
being
very
small
they
sat
very
close
side
by
side
on
a
piece
of
board
not
much
more
than
two
feet
long
which
for
want
of
proper
seats
was
laid
across
the
stern
of
the
boat
one
of
the
french
ships
was
burning
at
the
time
her
guns
went
off
as
fast
as
the
fire
reached
them
and
a
chance
shot
took
the
board
from
under
the
two
captains
the
english
captain
was
not
hurt
but
the
splinters
entered
the
body
of
the
french
captain
and
killed
him
late
in
the
evening
the
other
french
ships
that
were
ashore
were
set
fire
to
and
a
splendid
illumination
they
made
we
were
close
to
them
and
the
splinters
and
fragments
of
wreck
fell
on
board
of
us
among
our
killed
was
a
dutch
boatswain
mate
his
wife
was
on
board
and
the
stick
which
he
was
allowed
to
carry
in
virtue
of
his
office
he
very
frequently
applied
to
the
shoulders
of
his
helpmate
in
requital
for
certain
instances
of
infidelity
nor
with
all
my
respect
for
the
fair
sex
can
i
deny
that
the
punishment
was
generally
deserved
when
the
had
deprived
her
of
her
lawful
protector
and
the
guardian
of
her
honour
she
sat
by
the
side
of
his
mangled
remains
making
many
unavailing
efforts
to
weep
a
tear
from
one
eye
coursed
down
her
cheek
and
was
lost
in
her
mouth
one
from
the
other
eye
started
at
the
same
time
but
for
want
of
nourishment
halted
on
her
cheekbone
where
collecting
the
smoke
and
gunpowder
which
surrounded
us
it
formed
a
little
black
peninsula
and
isthmus
on
her
face
and
gave
to
her
heroic
grief
a
truly
mourning
tear
this
proof
of
conjugal
affection
she
would
not
part
with
until
the
following
day
when
having
seen
the
last
sad
rites
paid
to
the
body
of
her
faithful
achilles
she
washed
her
face
and
resumed
her
smiles
nor
was
she
ungrateful
to
the
ship
company
for
their
sympathy
we
were
ordered
up
to
spithead
with
despatches
and
long
before
we
arrived
she
had
made
the
sergeant
of
marines
the
happiest
of
men
under
a
promise
of
marriage
at
kingston
church
before
we
sailed
on
our
next
cruise
which
promise
was
most
honourably
performed
a
midshipman
vacancy
having
occurred
on
board
the
frigate
the
captain
offered
it
to
me
i
gladly
accepted
of
it
and
while
he
was
in
the
humour
i
asked
him
for
a
week
leave
of
absence
this
he
also
granted
adding
at
the
same
time
no
more
french
leave
if
you
please
i
need
not
say
that
not
an
hour
of
this
indulgence
was
intended
either
for
my
father
or
even
the
dear
emily
no
eugenia
the
beloved
in
her
interesting
condition
claimed
my
undivided
care
i
flew
to
g
found
the
troop
but
she
alas
had
left
it
a
fortnight
before
and
had
gone
no
one
knew
whither
distracted
with
this
fatal
news
i
sunk
into
a
chair
almost
senseless
when
one
of
the
actresses
brought
me
a
letter
i
knew
the
hand
it
was
that
of
eugenia
rushing
into
an
empty
parlour
i
broke
the
seal
and
read
as
follows
believe
me
my
dearest
mildmay
nothing
but
the
most
urgent
necessity
could
induce
me
to
cause
you
the
affliction
which
i
know
you
will
feel
on
reading
these
lines
circumstances
have
occurred
since
we
parted
that
not
only
render
it
necessary
that
i
should
quit
you
but
also
that
we
should
not
meet
again
for
some
time
and
that
you
should
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
my
place
of
abode
our
separation
though
long
will
not
i
trust
be
eternal
but
years
may
elapse
before
we
meet
again
the
sacrifice
is
great
to
me
but
your
honour
and
prosperity
demand
it
i
have
the
same
ardent
love
towards
you
that
i
ever
had
and
for
your
sake
will
love
and
cherish
your
child
i
am
supported
in
my
trial
by
a
hope
of
our
being
again
united
god
in
heaven
bless
you
and
prosper
all
your
undertakings
follow
up
your
profession
i
shall
hear
and
have
constant
intelligence
of
all
your
motions
and
i
shall
pray
to
heaven
to
spare
your
life
amidst
all
the
dangers
that
your
courage
will
urge
you
to
encounter
farewell
and
forget
not
her
who
never
has
you
one
moment
from
her
thoughts
eugenia
you
may
at
rimes
be
short
of
cash
i
know
you
are
very
thoughtless
in
that
respect
a
letter
to
the
subjoined
address
will
always
be
attended
to
and
enable
you
to
command
whatever
may
be
necessary
for
your
comfort
pride
might
induce
you
to
reject
this
offer
but
remember
it
is
eugenia
that
offers
and
if
you
love
her
as
she
thinks
you
do
you
will
accept
it
from
her
here
was
mystery
and
paradox
in
copious
confusion
obliged
by
circumstances
to
leave
me
to
conceal
the
place
of
her
retirement
yet
commanding
not
only
pecuniary
resources
for
herself
but
offering
me
any
sum
i
might
require
i
retired
to
my
bed
but
sleep
forsook
me
nor
did
i
want
it
i
had
too
much
to
think
of
and
no
clue
to
solve
my
doubts
i
prayed
to
heaven
for
her
welfare
vowed
eternal
constancy
and
at
length
fell
asleep
the
next
morning
i
took
leave
of
my
quondam
associates
and
returned
to
portsmouth
neither
wishing
to
see
my
father
my
family
or
even
the
sweet
emily
it
however
occurred
to
me
that
the
same
agent
who
could
advance
money
could
forward
a
letter
and
a
letter
i
wrote
expressing
all
i
felt
no
answer
was
returned
but
as
the
letter
never
came
back
i
was
convinced
it
was
received
and
occasionally
sent
others
the
contents
of
which
my
readers
will
no
doubt
feel
obliged
to
me
for
suppressing
being
of
all
things
in
the
world
the
most
stupid
except
to
the
parties
concerned
as
i
was
not
to
see
my
eugenia
i
was
delighted
to
hear
that
we
were
again
to
be
sent
on
active
service
the
scheldt
expedition
was
preparing
and
our
frigate
was
to
be
in
the
advance
but
our
gallant
and
favourite
captain
was
not
to
go
with
us
an
acting
captain
was
appointed
and
every
exertion
was
used
to
have
the
ship
ready
the
town
in
the
meantime
was
as
crowded
with
soldiers
as
spithead
and
the
harbour
was
with
transports
late
in
july
we
sailed
having
two
gunboats
in
tow
which
we
were
ordered
to
man
i
applied
for
and
obtained
the
command
of
one
of
them
quite
certain
that
i
should
see
more
service
and
consequently
have
more
amusement
than
if
i
remained
on
board
the
frigate
we
convoyed
forty
or
fifty
transports
containing
the
cavalry
and
brought
them
all
safe
to
an
anchor
off
cadsand
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
water
smooth
not
a
moment
was
lost
in
disembarking
the
troops
and
horses
and
i
do
not
recollect
ever
having
seen
either
before
or
since
a
more
pleasing
sight
the
men
were
first
sent
on
shore
with
their
saddles
and
bridles
the
horses
were
then
lowered
into
the
water
in
running
slings
which
were
slipped
clear
off
them
in
a
moment
and
as
soon
as
they
found
themselves
free
they
swam
away
for
the
shore
which
they
saluted
with
a
loud
neigh
as
soon
as
they
landed
in
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
we
had
three
or
four
hundred
horses
in
the
water
all
swimming
for
the
shore
at
the
same
time
while
their
anxious
riders
stood
on
the
beach
waiting
their
arrival
i
never
saw
so
novel
or
picturesque
a
sight
i
found
the
service
very
hard
we
were
stationed
off
batz
and
obliged
to
be
constantly
on
the
alert
but
when
flushing
surrendered
we
had
more
leisure
and
we
employed
it
in
procuring
some
articles
for
our
table
to
which
we
had
been
too
long
strangers
our
money
had
been
expended
in
the
purchase
of
champagne
and
claret
in
which
articles
we
were
no
economists
consequently
few
florins
could
be
spared
for
the
purchase
of
poultry
and
butcher
meat
but
then
these
articles
were
to
be
procured
by
the
same
means
which
had
given
us
the
island
of
walcheren
namely
powder
and
shot
the
country
people
were
very
churlish
and
not
at
all
inclined
to
barter
and
as
we
had
nothing
to
give
in
exchange
we
avoided
useless
discussion
turkeys
by
us
mortals
were
often
mistaken
for
pheasants
cocks
and
hens
for
partridges
tame
ducks
and
geese
for
wild
in
short
such
was
our
hurry
and
confusion
leaping
ditches
climbing
dykes
and
fording
swamps
that
buffon
himself
would
never
have
known
the
difference
between
a
goose
and
a
peacock
our
were
as
capacious
as
our
consciences
and
our
aim
as
good
as
our
appetites
the
peasants
shut
all
their
poultry
up
in
their
barns
and
very
liberally
bestowed
all
their
curses
upon
us
thus
all
our
supplies
were
cut
off
and
foraging
became
at
least
a
source
of
difficulty
if
not
of
danger
i
went
on
shore
with
our
party
put
a
bullet
into
my
and
as
i
thought
shot
a
deer
but
on
more
minute
inspection
it
proved
to
be
a
four
months
calf
this
was
an
accident
that
might
have
happened
to
any
man
the
carcass
was
too
heavy
to
carry
home
so
we
cut
it
in
halves
not
fore
and
aft
down
the
backbone
as
your
stupid
butchers
do
but
made
a
short
cut
across
the
loins
a
far
more
compendious
and
portable
method
than
the
other
we
marched
off
with
the
hind
legs
loins
and
kidney
having
first
of
all
buried
the
head
and
shoulders
in
the
field
determined
to
call
and
take
it
away
the
following
night
we
were
partly
seen
and
severely
scrutinized
in
our
action
by
a
neighbouring
whose
crew
were
no
doubt
as
hungry
as
ourselves
they
got
hold
of
one
of
our
men
who
like
a
fool
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
when
a
pint
of
grog
got
into
it
the
fellow
hinted
where
the
other
half
lay
and
these
went
after
it
fully
resolved
to
appropriate
it
to
themselves
but
they
were
outwitted
as
they
deserved
to
be
for
their
roguery
the
farmer
to
whom
the
calf
belonged
had
got
a
hint
of
what
was
done
and
finding
that
we
had
buried
one
half
of
the
calf
procured
a
party
of
soldiers
ready
to
take
possession
of
us
when
we
should
come
to
fetch
it
away
accordingly
the
party
who
went
from
the
other
after
dark
having
found
out
the
spot
were
very
busy
disinterring
their
prey
when
they
were
surprised
taken
prisoners
and
marched
away
to
the
british
camp
leaving
the
dead
body
behind
we
quite
unconscious
of
what
was
done
came
soon
after
found
our
veal
and
marched
off
with
it
the
prisoners
were
in
the
meantime
sent
on
board
the
flag
ship
with
the
charge
of
robbery
strongly
preferred
against
them
indeed
was
proved
in
vain
they
protested
that
they
were
not
the
slayers
but
only
went
in
search
of
what
others
had
killed
the
admiral
who
was
a
man
said
that
that
was
a
very
good
story
but
desired
them
not
to
tell
lies
to
old
rogues
and
ordered
them
all
under
arrest
at
the
same
time
giving
directions
for
a
most
rigid
scrutiny
into
the
larder
of
the
other
with
a
view
if
possible
to
discover
the
remains
of
the
calf
this
we
had
foreseen
would
happen
so
we
put
it
into
one
of
the
sailor
bags
and
sank
it
with
a
in
three
fathoms
water
where
it
lay
till
the
inspection
was
over
when
we
dressed
it
and
made
an
excellent
dinner
drinking
success
to
his
majesty
arms
by
land
and
sea
whether
i
had
been
intemperate
in
food
or
libation
i
know
not
but
i
was
attacked
with
the
walchèren
fever
and
was
sent
home
in
a
ship
and
perhaps
as
pangloss
says
it
was
all
for
the
best
for
i
knew
i
could
not
have
left
off
my
inveterate
habits
and
it
would
have
been
very
inconvenient
to
me
and
distressing
to
my
friends
to
have
ended
my
brilliant
career
and
stopped
these
memoirs
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
and
most
interesting
volume
by
hanging
the
author
up
like
a
scarecrow
under
the
superintendence
of
the
rascally
merely
for
catering
on
the
land
of
a
walcheren
farmer
moreover
the
dutch
were
unworthy
of
liberty
as
their
actions
proved
to
begrudge
a
few
fowls
or
a
fillet
of
veal
to
the
very
men
who
came
to
rescue
them
from
bondage
and
then
their
water
too
who
ever
drank
such
stuff
for
my
part
i
never
tasted
it
when
i
could
get
anything
better
as
to
their
nasty
swamps
and
fogs
quite
good
enough
for
such
croaking
fellows
as
they
are
what
could
induce
an
englishman
to
live
among
them
except
the
pleasure
of
killing
frenchmen
or
shooting
game
deprive
us
of
these
pursuits
which
the
surrender
of
flushing
effectually
did
and
walcheren
with
its
ophthalmia
and
its
agues
was
no
longer
a
place
for
a
gentleman
besides
i
plainly
saw
that
if
there
ever
had
been
any
intention
of
advancing
to
antwerp
the
time
was
now
gone
by
and
as
the
french
were
laughing
at
us
and
i
never
liked
to
be
made
a
butt
of
particularly
by
such
chaps
as
these
i
left
the
scene
of
our
sorrows
and
disgraces
without
regret
the
farewell
of
voltaire
came
into
my
mind
canaux
canardes
et
which
might
be
rendered
into
english
thus
dykes
ducks
and
dutchmen
so
i
returned
to
my
father
house
to
be
nursed
by
my
sister
and
to
astonish
the
neighbours
with
the
history
of
our
wonderful
achievements
chapter
xii
first
came
great
neptune
with
his
mace
that
rules
the
seas
and
makes
them
rise
or
fall
his
dewy
locks
did
drop
with
brine
apace
under
his
and
by
his
side
his
queene
with
coronall
fair
amphitrite
these
marched
farre
afore
the
other
crew
spenser
i
remained
no
longer
at
home
than
sufficed
to
restore
my
strength
after
the
serious
attack
of
fever
and
ague
which
i
had
brought
with
me
from
walcheren
although
my
father
received
me
kindly
he
had
not
forgotten
at
least
i
thought
so
my
former
transgressions
a
mutual
distrust
destroyed
that
intimacy
which
ought
ever
to
exist
between
father
and
son
the
thread
was
broken
it
is
vain
to
enquire
how
and
the
consequence
was
that
the
day
of
my
departure
to
join
a
frigate
on
the
north
american
station
was
welcomed
with
joy
by
me
and
seen
unregretted
by
my
father
the
ship
i
was
about
to
join
was
commanded
by
a
young
nobleman
and
as
patricians
were
not
so
plentiful
in
the
service
at
that
time
as
they
have
since
become
i
was
considered
fortunate
in
my
appointment
i
was
ordered
with
about
thirty
more
supernumerary
midshipmen
to
take
my
passage
in
a
ship
of
the
line
going
to
bermuda
the
was
given
to
us
as
our
place
of
residence
the
midshipmen
belonging
to
the
ship
occupying
the
two
snug
berths
in
the
cockpit
among
so
many
young
men
of
different
habits
and
circumstances
all
joining
the
ship
at
different
periods
no
combination
could
be
made
for
forming
a
mess
the
ship
sailed
soon
after
i
got
on
board
and
our
party
during
the
voyage
was
usually
supplied
from
the
i
have
thought
it
very
wonderful
that
a
mess
of
eight
or
twelve
seamen
or
marines
will
always
make
the
allowance
last
from
one
week
to
another
and
have
something
to
spare
but
with
the
same
number
of
midshipmen
the
case
is
very
different
and
the
larger
the
mess
the
more
do
their
difficulties
increase
they
are
never
satisfied
never
have
enough
and
if
the
purser
will
allow
them
are
always
in
debt
for
flour
beef
pork
and
spirits
this
is
owing
to
their
natural
habits
of
carelessness
and
our
mess
for
this
reason
was
particularly
uncomfortable
the
government
was
a
democracy
but
the
caterer
had
at
times
been
invested
with
dictatorial
powers
which
he
either
abused
or
was
thought
to
abuse
and
he
was
accordingly
turned
out
or
resigned
in
disgust
at
the
end
of
two
or
three
days
most
of
my
messmates
were
young
men
senior
to
me
in
the
service
having
passed
their
examinations
and
were
going
to
america
for
promotion
but
when
mustered
on
the
whether
they
appeared
less
manly
or
were
in
fact
less
expert
in
their
duty
i
know
not
but
certain
it
is
that
the
first
lieutenant
appointed
me
mate
of
a
watch
and
placed
several
of
these
aspirants
under
my
orders
and
so
strong
did
we
muster
that
we
stood
in
each
other
way
when
on
deck
keeping
our
watch
seldom
less
than
seventeen
or
eighteen
in
number
in
the
we
agreed
very
ill
together
and
one
principal
cause
of
this
was
our
short
allowance
of
food
daily
skirmishes
took
place
and
not
unfrequently
pitched
battles
but
i
never
took
any
other
part
in
them
than
as
a
spectator
and
the
observations
i
made
convinced
me
that
i
should
have
no
great
difficulty
in
mastering
the
whole
of
them
the
office
of
caterer
was
one
of
neither
honour
nor
emolument
and
it
was
voluntarily
taken
up
and
peevishly
laid
down
on
the
first
trifling
provocation
with
the
ship
allowance
no
being
less
than
an
angel
could
have
given
satisfaction
the
division
of
beef
and
pork
into
as
many
parcels
as
there
were
claimants
always
produced
remonstrance
reproof
and
blows
i
was
never
quarrelsome
and
took
the
part
allotted
to
me
quietly
enough
until
they
finding
my
disposition
to
submit
i
found
my
portion
daily
decrease
and
on
the
resignation
of
the
thirteenth
caterer
i
volunteered
my
services
which
were
gladly
accepted
aware
of
the
danger
and
difficulty
of
my
situation
i
was
prepared
accordingly
on
the
first
day
that
i
shared
the
provisions
i
took
very
good
care
of
number
one
and
as
i
had
foreseen
was
attacked
by
two
or
three
for
my
division
of
the
prey
upon
this
i
made
them
a
short
speech
observing
that
if
they
supposed
i
meant
to
take
the
trouble
of
catering
for
nothing
they
were
very
much
mistaken
that
the
small
difference
i
made
between
their
portions
and
mine
if
equally
divided
among
them
would
not
fill
a
hollow
tooth
and
that
after
my
own
share
all
others
should
be
distributed
with
the
most
rigid
impartiality
and
scrupulous
regard
to
justice
this
very
reasonable
speech
did
not
satisfy
them
i
was
challenged
to
decide
the
point
la
two
candidates
for
the
honour
stepped
out
at
once
i
desired
them
to
toss
up
and
having
soon
defeated
the
winner
i
recommended
him
to
return
to
his
seat
the
next
man
came
forward
hoping
to
find
an
easy
victory
after
the
fatigue
of
a
recent
battle
but
he
was
mistaken
and
retired
with
severe
chastisement
the
next
day
i
took
my
seat
cleared
for
action
coat
waistcoat
and
neckcloth
off
i
observed
that
i
should
proceed
as
i
had
done
before
and
was
ready
to
hold
a
court
of
oyer
and
terminer
but
no
suitors
appeared
and
i
held
the
office
of
caterer
from
that
day
till
i
quitted
the
ship
by
the
strongest
of
all
possible
claims
first
by
election
and
secondly
by
right
of
conquest
we
had
not
been
many
days
at
sea
before
we
discovered
that
our
first
lieutenant
was
a
most
abominable
tyrant
a
brutal
fellow
a
drunkard
and
a
glutton
with
a
long
red
nose
and
a
large
belly
he
frequently
sent
midshipmen
to
the
at
a
time
this
man
i
determined
to
turn
out
of
the
ship
and
mentioned
my
intention
to
my
messmates
promising
them
success
if
they
would
only
follow
my
advice
they
quite
laughed
at
the
idea
but
i
was
firm
and
told
them
that
it
should
come
to
pass
if
they
would
but
behave
so
ill
as
just
to
incur
a
slight
punishment
or
reprimand
from
nosey
every
day
this
they
agreed
to
and
not
a
day
passed
but
they
were
either
or
put
watch
and
watch
they
reported
all
to
me
and
asked
my
advice
complain
to
the
captain
said
i
they
did
and
were
told
that
the
first
lieutenant
had
done
his
duty
the
same
causes
produced
the
same
effects
on
each
succeeding
day
and
when
the
midshipmen
complained
they
had
no
redress
by
my
direction
they
observed
to
the
captain
it
is
of
no
use
complaining
sir
you
always
take
mr
clewline
part
the
captain
indeed
from
a
general
sense
of
propriety
gave
his
support
to
the
officers
knowing
that
nine
times
in
ten
midshipmen
were
in
the
wrong
things
worked
as
i
wished
the
midshipmen
persisted
in
behaving
ill
remonstrated
and
declared
that
the
first
lieutenant
did
not
tell
the
truth
for
a
time
many
of
them
lost
the
favour
of
the
captain
but
i
encouraged
them
to
bear
that
as
well
as
the
increased
rancour
of
old
nosey
one
day
two
midshipmen
by
previous
agreement
began
to
fight
on
the
lee
gangway
in
those
days
that
was
crime
enough
almost
to
have
hanged
them
they
were
sent
to
the
for
three
hours
and
when
they
came
down
applied
to
me
for
advice
go
said
i
and
complain
if
the
first
lieutenant
says
you
were
fighting
tell
the
captain
you
were
only
showing
how
the
first
lieutenant
pummelled
the
men
last
night
when
they
were
hoisting
the
topsails
and
the
way
he
cut
the
marine
head
when
he
knocked
him
down
the
hatchway
all
this
was
fairly
done
the
midshipmen
received
a
reprimand
but
the
captain
began
to
think
there
might
be
some
cause
for
these
continued
complaints
which
daily
increased
both
in
weight
and
number
at
last
we
were
enabled
to
give
the
de
a
wretched
boy
in
the
ship
whose
dirty
habits
often
brought
him
to
the
gun
was
so
hardened
that
he
laughed
at
all
the
stripes
of
the
boatswain
cat
inflicted
on
him
by
the
first
lieutenant
i
will
make
him
feel
said
the
enraged
officer
so
ordering
a
bowl
of
brine
to
be
brought
to
him
he
sprinkled
it
on
the
lacerated
flesh
of
the
boy
between
every
lash
this
inhuman
act
so
unbecoming
the
character
of
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
we
all
resented
and
retiring
to
the
in
a
body
gave
three
deep
and
heavy
groans
in
chorus
the
effect
was
dismal
it
was
heard
in
the
and
the
first
lieutenant
sent
down
to
desire
we
should
be
quiet
on
which
we
immediately
gave
three
more
which
sent
him
in
a
rage
to
the
where
we
were
all
summoned
and
the
reason
of
the
noise
demanded
i
had
till
then
kept
myself
in
the
background
content
with
being
the
without
being
seen
i
was
always
strict
to
my
duty
and
never
had
been
complained
of
my
coming
forward
therefore
on
this
occasion
produced
a
fine
stage
effect
and
carried
great
weight
i
told
the
lieutenant
we
were
groaning
for
the
poor
boy
who
had
been
pickled
this
increased
his
rage
and
he
ordered
me
up
to
the
i
refused
to
go
until
i
had
seen
the
captain
who
at
that
moment
made
his
appearance
on
deck
i
immediately
referred
to
him
related
the
whole
story
not
omitting
to
mention
the
repeated
acts
of
tyranny
which
the
lieutenant
had
perpetrated
on
us
all
i
saw
in
a
moment
that
we
had
gained
the
day
the
captain
had
given
the
most
positive
orders
that
no
one
should
be
punished
without
his
express
permission
this
order
the
lieutenant
had
disobeyed
and
that
added
to
his
unpopular
character
decided
his
fate
the
captain
walked
into
his
cabin
and
the
next
day
signified
to
the
first
lieutenant
that
he
must
quit
the
ship
on
her
arrival
in
port
or
be
tried
by
a
this
latter
he
knew
he
dared
not
stand
i
should
have
informed
my
reader
that
our
orders
were
to
see
the
convoy
as
far
as
the
tenth
degree
of
north
latitude
and
then
proceed
to
bermuda
this
was
of
itself
a
pleasant
cruise
and
gave
us
the
chance
of
falling
in
either
with
an
enemy
or
a
recapture
ships
not
intending
to
cross
the
line
usually
grant
a
saturnalia
to
the
crew
when
they
come
to
the
tropic
of
capricorn
it
is
thought
to
renovate
their
spirits
and
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
cruise
or
voyage
where
time
flows
on
in
such
a
smooth
undeviating
routine
that
one
day
is
not
distinguishable
from
another
our
captain
a
young
man
and
a
perfect
gentleman
never
refused
any
indulgence
to
the
men
compatible
with
discipline
and
the
safety
of
the
ship
and
as
the
regular
blew
there
was
no
danger
of
sudden
squalls
the
ceremony
of
crossing
the
line
i
am
aware
has
been
often
described
so
has
italy
and
the
rhine
but
there
are
varieties
of
ways
of
doing
and
relating
these
things
ours
had
its
singularity
and
ended
i
am
sorry
to
say
in
a
deep
tragedy
which
i
shall
remember
as
long
as
memory
holds
her
seat
one
beautiful
morning
as
soon
as
the
people
had
breakfasted
they
began
to
prepare
by
stripping
to
their
waists
and
wearing
nothing
but
a
pair
of
duck
trousers
the
man
at
the
called
out
that
he
saw
something
on
the
weather
bow
which
he
thought
was
a
boat
soon
after
an
unknown
voice
from
the
hailed
the
ship
the
officer
of
the
watch
answered
and
the
voice
commanded
him
to
heave
to
as
neptune
was
coming
on
board
the
ship
was
accordingly
hove
to
with
every
formality
though
going
at
the
rate
of
seven
miles
an
hour
the
squared
the
head
and
braced
up
as
soon
as
the
ship
was
hove
to
a
young
man
one
of
the
sailors
dressed
in
a
smart
suit
of
black
and
buckles
with
his
hair
powdered
and
with
all
the
extra
finery
and
mincing
gait
of
an
exquisite
came
aft
on
the
and
with
a
most
polished
bow
took
the
liberty
of
introducing
himself
as
to
mr
neptune
who
had
been
desired
to
precede
his
master
and
acquaint
the
commander
of
the
vessel
with
his
intended
visit
a
sail
had
been
extended
across
the
forecastle
by
way
of
curtain
and
from
behind
this
neptune
and
his
train
in
full
costume
shortly
afterwards
came
forth
the
car
of
the
god
consisted
of
a
it
was
drawn
by
six
black
men
part
of
the
ship
crew
they
were
tall
muscular
fellows
their
heads
were
covered
with
and
they
wore
a
very
small
pair
of
cotton
drawers
in
other
respects
they
were
perfectly
naked
their
skins
were
spotted
all
over
with
red
and
white
paint
alternately
they
had
conch
shells
in
their
hands
with
which
they
made
a
most
horrible
noise
neptune
was
masked
as
were
many
of
his
attendants
and
none
of
the
officers
knew
exactly
by
which
of
the
men
the
god
was
represented
but
he
was
a
shrewd
hand
and
did
his
part
very
well
he
wore
a
naval
crown
made
by
the
ship
armourer
in
his
right
hand
he
held
a
trident
on
the
prongs
of
which
there
was
a
dolphin
which
he
had
he
said
struck
that
morning
he
wore
a
large
wig
made
of
oakum
and
a
beard
of
the
same
materials
which
flowed
down
to
his
waist
he
was
full
powdered
and
his
naked
body
was
bedaubed
with
paint
the
god
was
attended
by
a
splendid
court
his
secretary
of
state
whose
head
was
stuck
full
of
the
quills
of
the
sea
bird
of
these
latitudes
his
surgeon
with
his
lancet
and
his
his
barber
with
a
razor
whose
blade
was
two
feet
long
cut
off
an
iron
hoop
and
the
barber
mate
who
carried
a
small
tub
as
a
the
materials
within
i
could
not
analyze
but
my
nose
convinced
me
that
no
part
of
them
came
from
smith
in
amphitrite
followed
on
a
similar
carriage
drawn
by
six
white
men
whose
costume
was
like
the
others
this
goddess
was
personified
by
an
athletic
ugly
man
marked
with
the
dressed
as
a
female
with
a
woman
on
his
head
ornamented
with
sprigs
of
she
had
a
harpoon
in
her
hand
on
which
was
fixed
an
albicore
and
in
her
lap
lay
one
of
the
boys
of
the
ship
dressed
as
a
baby
with
long
clothes
and
a
cap
he
held
in
his
hand
a
marlinspike
which
was
suspended
round
his
neck
with
a
rope
yarn
this
was
to
assist
him
in
cutting
his
teeth
as
the
children
on
shore
use
a
coral
his
nurse
attended
him
with
a
bucket
full
of
burgoo
or
hasty
pudding
with
which
she
occasionally
fed
him
out
of
the
cook
iron
ladle
two
or
three
stout
men
were
habited
as
sea
nymphs
to
attend
on
the
goddess
they
carried
a
some
a
and
a
pot
of
red
paint
by
way
of
rouge
as
soon
as
the
procession
appeared
on
the
forecastle
the
captain
attended
by
his
steward
bearing
a
tray
with
a
bottle
of
wine
and
some
glasses
came
out
of
his
cabin
and
the
cars
of
the
marine
deities
were
drawn
up
on
the
neptune
lowered
his
trident
and
presented
the
dolphin
to
the
captain
as
amphitrite
did
her
albicore
in
token
of
submission
and
homage
to
the
representative
of
the
king
of
great
britain
i
have
come
said
the
god
to
welcome
you
into
my
dominions
and
to
present
my
wife
and
child
the
captain
bowed
allow
me
to
ask
after
my
brother
and
liege
sovereign
the
good
old
king
george
he
is
not
so
well
said
the
captain
as
i
and
all
his
subjects
could
wish
more
the
pity
replied
neptune
and
how
is
the
prince
of
wales
the
prince
is
well
said
the
captain
and
now
governs
as
regent
in
the
name
of
his
royal
father
and
how
does
he
get
on
with
his
wife
said
the
inquisitive
god
bad
enough
said
the
captain
they
agree
together
like
a
whale
and
a
thrasher
ah
i
thought
so
said
the
god
of
the
sea
his
royal
highness
should
take
a
leaf
out
of
my
book
never
allow
it
to
be
doubtful
who
is
commanding
officer
and
pray
what
might
your
majesty
specific
be
to
cure
a
bad
wife
said
the
captain
three
feet
of
the
brace
every
morning
before
breakfast
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
half
an
hour
on
a
sunday
but
why
more
on
a
sunday
than
any
other
day
said
the
captain
why
said
neptune
why
because
she
been
keeping
saturday
night
to
be
sure
besides
she
has
less
to
do
of
a
sunday
and
more
time
to
think
of
her
sins
and
do
penance
but
you
would
not
have
a
prince
strike
a
lady
surely
would
i
no
to
be
sure
if
she
behave
herself
as
on
no
account
but
if
she
gives
tongue
and
wo
keep
sober
i
sarve
her
as
i
do
amphy
do
i
amphy
chucking
the
goddess
under
the
chin
we
have
no
bad
wives
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
so
if
you
know
how
to
keep
in
order
send
them
to
us
but
your
majesty
remedy
is
violent
we
should
have
a
rebellion
in
england
if
the
king
was
to
beat
his
wife
make
the
lords
in
waiting
do
it
then
said
the
surly
god
and
if
they
are
too
lazy
which
i
dare
say
they
are
send
for
a
mate
from
the
royal
billy
he
sarve
her
out
i
warrant
you
and
for
half
a
gallon
of
rum
would
teach
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
to
dance
the
binnacle
hornpipe
into
the
bargain
his
royal
highness
shall
certainly
hear
your
advice
mr
neptune
but
whether
he
will
follow
it
or
not
is
not
for
me
to
say
would
you
please
to
drink
his
royal
highness
good
health
with
all
my
heart
sir
i
was
always
loyal
to
my
king
and
ready
to
drink
his
health
and
to
fight
for
him
the
captain
presented
the
god
with
a
bumper
of
madeira
and
another
to
the
goddess
here
a
good
health
and
a
long
life
to
our
gracious
king
and
all
the
royal
family
the
roads
are
unkimmon
dusty
and
we
wet
our
lips
since
we
left
st
thomas
on
the
line
this
morning
but
we
have
no
time
to
lose
captain
said
the
sea
god
i
see
many
new
faces
here
as
requires
washing
and
shaving
and
if
we
add
bleeding
and
physic
they
will
be
all
the
better
for
it
the
captain
nodded
assent
and
neptune
striking
the
deck
with
the
end
of
his
trident
commanded
attention
and
thus
addressed
his
court
heark
ye
my
tritons
you
are
called
here
to
shave
duck
and
physic
all
as
needs
but
i
command
you
to
be
gentle
i
have
no
if
we
gets
a
bad
name
we
gets
no
more
fees
and
the
first
of
you
as
disobeys
my
orders
i
tie
him
to
a
mortar
and
sink
him
ten
thousand
fathoms
deep
in
the
ocean
where
he
shall
feed
on
salt
water
and
for
a
hundred
years
begone
to
your
work
twelve
constables
with
thick
sticks
immediately
repaired
to
the
hatchway
and
sent
down
all
who
had
not
been
initiated
guarding
them
strictly
until
they
were
called
up
one
by
one
the
had
been
previously
prepared
for
the
bathing
it
was
lined
with
double
canvas
and
boarded
so
that
it
held
water
and
contained
about
four
butts
which
was
constantly
renewed
by
the
pump
many
of
the
officers
purchased
exemption
from
shaving
and
physic
by
a
bottle
of
rum
but
none
could
escape
the
sprinkling
of
salt
water
which
fell
about
in
great
profusion
even
the
captain
received
his
share
but
with
great
and
seemed
to
enjoy
the
sport
it
was
easy
to
perceive
on
this
occasion
who
were
favourites
with
the
company
by
the
degree
of
severity
with
which
they
were
treated
the
tyro
was
seated
on
the
side
of
the
he
was
asked
the
place
of
his
nativity
and
the
moment
he
opened
his
mouth
the
of
the
barber
which
was
a
very
large
paint
brush
was
crammed
in
with
all
the
filthy
lather
with
which
they
covered
his
face
and
chin
this
was
roughly
scraped
off
with
the
great
razor
the
doctor
felt
his
pulse
and
prescribed
a
pill
which
was
forced
into
his
cheek
and
the
the
cork
of
which
was
armed
with
short
points
of
pins
was
so
forcibly
applied
to
his
nose
as
to
bring
blood
after
this
he
was
thrown
backwards
into
the
bath
and
allowed
to
scramble
out
the
best
way
he
could
the
and
ship
corporals
and
purser
steward
were
severely
treated
the
midshipmen
looked
out
for
the
first
lieutenant
but
he
kept
so
close
under
the
wing
of
the
captain
that
for
a
long
time
we
were
unable
to
succeed
at
length
some
great
uproar
in
the
waist
induced
him
to
run
down
when
we
all
surrounded
him
and
plied
him
so
effectually
with
buckets
of
water
that
he
was
glad
to
run
down
the
and
seek
shelter
in
the
as
he
ran
down
we
threw
the
buckets
after
him
and
he
fell
like
the
roman
virgin
covered
with
the
shields
of
the
soldiers
the
purser
had
fortified
himself
in
his
cabin
and
with
his
sword
and
pistols
vowed
vengeance
against
all
intruders
but
the
middies
were
not
to
be
frightened
with
swords
or
pistols
so
we
had
him
out
and
gave
him
a
sound
ducking
because
he
had
refused
to
let
us
have
more
spirits
than
our
allowance
he
was
paraded
to
the
in
great
form
his
sword
held
over
his
head
his
pistols
in
a
bucket
of
water
carried
before
him
and
having
been
duly
shaved
physicked
and
soused
into
the
he
was
allowed
to
return
to
his
cabin
like
a
drowned
rat
the
first
lieutenant
of
marines
was
a
great
bore
he
was
always
annoying
us
with
his
german
flute
having
no
ear
of
his
own
he
had
no
mercy
on
ours
so
we
handed
him
to
the
bath
and
in
addition
to
all
the
other
luxuries
of
the
day
made
him
drink
half
a
pint
of
salt
water
which
we
poured
into
his
mouth
through
his
own
flute
as
a
funnel
i
now
recollect
that
it
was
the
cries
of
the
poor
marine
which
brought
down
the
first
lieutenant
who
ordered
us
to
desist
and
we
served
him
as
hath
been
related
thus
far
all
was
hilarity
and
mirth
but
the
scene
was
very
suddenly
changed
one
of
the
foretopmen
drawing
water
in
the
chains
fell
overboard
the
alarm
was
instantly
given
and
the
ship
hove
to
i
ran
upon
the
poop
and
seeing
that
the
man
could
not
swim
jumped
overboard
to
save
him
the
height
from
which
i
descended
made
me
go
very
deep
in
the
water
and
when
i
arose
i
could
perceive
one
of
the
man
hands
i
swam
towards
him
but
o
god
what
was
my
horror
when
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
his
blood
i
comprehended
in
a
moment
that
a
shark
had
taken
him
and
expected
that
every
instant
my
own
fate
would
be
like
his
i
wonder
i
had
not
sunk
with
fear
i
was
nearly
paralyzed
the
ship
which
had
been
going
six
or
seven
miles
an
hour
was
at
some
distance
and
i
gave
myself
up
for
gone
i
had
scarcely
the
power
of
reflection
and
was
overwhelmed
by
the
sudden
awful
and
as
i
thought
certain
approach
of
death
in
its
most
horrible
shape
in
a
moment
i
recollected
myself
and
i
believe
the
actions
of
five
years
crowded
into
my
mind
in
as
many
minutes
i
prayed
most
fervently
and
vowed
amendment
if
it
should
please
god
to
spare
me
my
prayer
was
heard
and
i
believe
it
was
a
special
providence
that
rescued
me
from
the
jaws
of
the
fish
i
was
nearly
a
mile
from
the
ship
before
i
was
picked
up
and
when
the
boat
came
alongside
with
me
three
large
sharks
were
under
the
stern
these
had
devoured
the
poor
sailor
and
fortunately
for
me
had
followed
the
ship
for
more
prey
and
thus
left
me
to
myself
as
i
went
up
the
side
i
was
received
by
the
captain
and
officers
in
the
most
flattering
manner
the
captain
thanked
me
in
the
presence
of
the
ship
company
for
my
praiseworthy
exertions
and
i
was
gazed
on
by
all
as
an
object
of
interest
and
admiration
but
if
others
thought
so
of
me
i
thought
not
so
of
myself
i
retired
below
to
my
berth
with
a
loathing
and
contempt
a
which
i
can
not
describe
i
felt
myself
unworthy
of
the
mercy
i
had
received
the
disgraceful
and
vicious
course
of
life
i
had
led
burst
upon
me
with
horrible
conviction
tonantem
credidimus
jovem
says
horace
and
it
was
only
by
the
excitement
of
such
peculiarly
horrid
situations
that
the
sense
of
a
superintending
power
could
be
awakened
within
me
a
hardened
and
incorrigible
sinner
i
changed
my
clothes
and
was
glad
when
night
came
that
i
might
be
left
to
myself
but
oh
how
infinitely
more
horrid
did
my
situation
appear
i
shuddered
when
i
thought
of
what
i
had
gone
through
and
i
made
the
most
solemn
promises
of
a
new
life
how
transient
were
these
feelings
how
long
did
these
good
resolutions
last
just
as
long
as
no
temptation
came
in
the
way
as
long
as
there
was
no
excitement
to
sin
no
means
of
gratifying
appetite
my
good
intentions
were
traced
in
the
sand
i
was
very
soon
as
thoughtless
and
as
profane
as
ever
although
frequently
checked
by
the
remembrance
of
my
providential
escape
and
for
years
afterwards
the
thoughts
of
the
shark
taking
me
by
the
leg
was
accompanied
by
the
acknowledgment
that
the
devil
would
have
me
in
like
manner
if
i
did
not
amend
if
after
this
awakening
circumstance
i
could
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
have
met
with
and
religious
people
i
have
no
doubt
but
i
might
have
had
at
this
time
much
less
to
answer
for
but
that
not
being
the
case
the
force
of
habit
and
example
renewed
its
dominion
over
me
and
i
became
nearly
as
bad
as
ever
our
amusements
in
the
were
rough
one
of
them
was
to
lie
on
the
mess
table
under
the
tiller
and
to
hold
by
the
tiller
ropes
above
while
we
kicked
at
all
who
attempted
to
dislodge
us
either
by
force
or
stratagem
whoever
had
possession
had
nine
points
of
the
law
and
could
easily
oppose
the
whole
i
one
day
held
this
envied
position
and
kept
all
at
bay
when
unluckily
one
of
the
passed
midshipmen
who
had
got
very
drunk
with
the
gunner
came
in
and
made
a
furious
attack
on
me
i
gave
him
a
kick
on
the
face
that
sent
him
with
great
violence
on
his
back
among
the
plates
and
dishes
which
had
been
removed
from
the
and
placed
between
the
guns
enraged
as
much
at
the
laughter
against
him
as
at
the
blow
he
had
received
he
snatched
up
a
carving
fork
and
before
any
one
was
aware
of
his
intention
stabbed
me
with
it
four
times
i
jumped
up
to
punish
him
but
the
moment
i
got
on
my
legs
was
so
stiff
that
i
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
my
messmates
the
surgeon
examined
the
wounds
which
were
serious
two
of
them
nearly
touched
an
artery
i
was
put
to
bed
sick
and
was
three
weeks
confined
to
my
berth
the
midshipman
who
had
committed
this
outrage
was
very
penitent
when
sober
and
implored
my
pardon
and
forgiveness
naturally
i
freely
forgave
because
i
was
disarmed
by
submission
i
never
trampled
on
a
prostrate
foe
the
surgeon
reported
me
ill
of
a
fever
which
was
true
for
had
the
captain
known
the
real
fact
the
midshipman
whose
commission
was
signed
and
in
the
ship
ready
to
be
delivered
to
him
on
his
arrival
at
bermuda
would
certainly
have
lost
his
promotion
my
kindness
to
him
i
believe
wounded
him
more
than
my
resentment
he
became
exceedingly
melancholy
and
thoughtful
gave
up
drinking
and
was
ever
after
greatly
attached
to
me
i
reckon
this
among
the
few
good
actions
of
my
life
and
own
i
have
great
pleasure
in
reflecting
upon
it
we
arrived
at
bermuda
soon
after
having
left
the
convoy
in
the
latitude
of
ten
degrees
north
the
supernumeraries
were
all
discharged
into
their
respective
ships
and
before
we
separated
we
had
the
pleasure
to
see
the
first
lieutenant
take
his
passage
in
a
ship
bound
to
england
most
sincerely
did
we
congratulate
ourselves
on
the
success
of
our
intrigue
chapter
xiii
where
the
remote
bermudas
ride
in
th
ocean
bosom
andrew
marvell
there
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
beauty
among
these
islands
which
we
might
really
believe
to
be
the
abode
of
fairies
they
consist
of
a
cluster
of
rocks
formed
by
the
zoophyte
or
coral
worm
the
number
of
the
islands
is
said
to
be
equal
to
the
days
of
the
year
they
are
covered
with
a
short
green
sward
dark
cedar
trees
and
low
white
houses
which
have
a
pretty
and
pleasing
effect
the
harbours
are
numerous
but
shallow
and
though
there
are
many
channels
into
them
there
is
but
one
for
large
ships
into
the
principal
anchorage
numerous
caverns
whose
roofs
sparkle
with
the
spars
and
stalactites
formed
by
the
dripping
water
are
found
in
every
part
of
the
islands
they
contain
springs
of
delicious
coolness
to
quench
the
thirst
or
to
bathe
in
the
sailors
have
a
notion
that
these
islands
float
and
that
the
crust
which
composes
them
is
so
thin
as
to
be
broken
with
little
exertion
one
man
being
confined
in
the
guardhouse
for
having
got
drunk
and
misbehaved
stamped
on
the
ground
and
roared
to
the
guard
let
me
out
or
d
nour
eyes
i
knock
a
hole
in
your
bottom
scuttle
your
island
and
send
you
all
to
h
together
rocks
and
shoals
abound
in
almost
every
direction
but
chiefly
on
the
north
and
west
sides
they
are
however
well
known
to
the
native
pilots
and
serve
as
a
safeguard
from
nightly
surprise
or
invasion
varieties
of
fish
are
found
here
beautiful
to
the
eye
and
delicious
to
the
taste
of
these
the
best
is
the
red
grouper
when
on
a
calm
clear
day
you
glide
among
these
lovely
islands
in
your
boat
you
seem
to
be
sailing
over
a
submarine
in
which
clumps
of
trees
shrubs
flowers
and
gravel
walks
are
planted
in
wild
but
regular
confusion
my
chief
employment
was
afloat
and
according
to
my
usual
habit
i
found
no
amusement
unless
it
was
attended
with
danger
and
this
propensity
found
ample
gratification
in
the
whale
fishery
the
season
for
which
was
just
approaching
the
ferocity
of
the
fish
in
these
southern
latitudes
appears
to
be
increased
both
from
the
heat
of
the
climate
and
the
care
of
their
young
for
which
reason
it
would
seem
that
the
risk
in
taking
them
is
greater
than
in
the
polar
seas
from
what
i
am
able
to
learn
of
the
natural
history
of
the
whale
she
brings
forth
her
young
seldom
more
than
one
at
a
time
in
the
northern
regions
after
which
with
the
calf
at
her
side
the
mother
seeks
a
more
genial
climate
to
bring
it
to
maturity
they
generally
reach
bermuda
about
the
middle
of
march
where
they
remain
but
a
few
weeks
after
which
they
visit
the
west
india
islands
then
bear
away
to
the
southward
and
go
round
cape
horn
returning
to
the
polar
seas
by
the
aleutian
islands
and
behring
straits
which
they
reach
in
the
following
summer
when
the
young
whale
having
acquired
size
and
strength
in
the
southern
latitudes
is
enabled
to
contend
with
his
enemies
in
the
north
and
here
also
the
dam
meets
the
male
again
from
my
own
experience
and
the
inquiries
i
have
been
enabled
to
make
i
am
tolerably
certain
that
this
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
migration
of
these
animals
the
females
annually
making
the
tour
of
the
two
great
american
continents
attended
by
their
young
the
maternal
solicitude
of
the
whale
makes
her
a
dangerous
adversary
and
many
serious
accidents
occur
in
the
season
for
catching
whales
on
one
occasion
i
had
nearly
paid
with
my
life
for
the
gratification
of
my
curiosity
i
went
in
a
rowed
by
coloured
men
natives
of
the
islands
who
were
very
daring
and
expert
in
this
pursuit
we
saw
a
whale
with
her
calf
playing
round
the
coral
rocks
the
attention
which
the
dam
showed
to
its
young
the
care
she
took
to
warn
it
of
danger
was
truly
affecting
she
led
it
away
from
the
boats
swam
round
it
and
sometimes
she
would
embrace
it
with
her
fins
and
roll
over
with
it
in
the
waves
we
contrived
to
get
the
ground
by
going
to
seaward
of
her
and
by
that
means
drove
her
into
shoal
water
among
the
rocks
at
last
we
came
so
near
the
young
one
that
the
harpooner
poised
his
weapon
knowing
that
the
calf
once
struck
the
mother
was
our
own
for
she
would
never
desert
it
aware
of
the
danger
and
impending
fate
of
its
inexperienced
offspring
she
swam
rapidly
round
it
in
decreasing
circles
evincing
the
utmost
uneasiness
and
anxiety
but
the
parental
admonitions
were
unheeded
and
it
met
its
fate
the
boat
approached
the
side
of
the
younger
fish
and
the
harpooner
buried
his
tremendous
weapon
deep
in
the
ribs
the
moment
it
felt
the
wound
the
poor
animal
darted
from
us
taking
out
a
hundred
fathom
of
line
but
a
young
fish
is
soon
conquered
when
once
well
struck
such
was
the
case
in
this
instance
it
was
no
sooner
checked
with
the
line
than
it
turned
on
its
back
and
displaying
its
white
belly
on
the
surface
of
the
water
floated
a
lifeless
corpse
the
unhappy
parent
with
an
instinct
always
more
powerful
than
reason
never
quitted
the
body
we
hauled
in
upon
the
line
and
came
close
up
to
our
quarry
just
as
another
boat
had
fixed
a
harpoon
in
the
mother
the
tail
of
the
furious
animal
descended
with
irresistible
force
upon
the
very
centre
of
our
boat
cutting
it
in
two
and
killing
two
of
the
men
the
survivors
took
to
swimming
for
their
lives
in
all
directions
the
whale
went
in
pursuit
of
the
third
boat
but
was
checked
by
the
line
from
the
one
that
had
struck
her
she
towed
them
at
the
rate
of
ten
or
eleven
miles
an
hour
and
had
she
had
deep
water
would
have
taken
the
boat
down
or
obliged
them
to
cut
away
from
her
the
two
boats
were
so
much
employed
that
they
could
not
come
to
our
assistance
for
some
time
and
we
were
left
to
our
own
resources
much
longer
than
i
thought
agreeable
i
was
going
to
swim
to
the
calf
whale
but
one
of
the
men
advised
me
not
to
do
so
saying
that
the
sharks
would
be
as
thick
about
him
as
the
lawyers
round
westminster
hall
and
that
i
should
certainly
be
snapped
up
if
i
went
near
for
my
comfort
he
added
these
devils
seldom
touch
a
man
if
they
can
get
anything
else
this
might
be
very
true
but
i
must
confess
i
was
very
glad
to
see
one
of
the
boats
come
to
our
assistance
while
the
mother
whale
encumbered
with
the
heavy
harpoon
and
line
and
exhausted
with
the
fountain
of
black
blood
which
she
threw
up
drew
near
to
her
calf
and
died
by
its
side
evidently
in
her
last
moments
more
occupied
with
the
preservation
of
her
young
than
of
herself
as
soon
as
she
turned
on
her
back
i
had
reason
to
thank
the
mudian
for
his
good
advice
there
were
at
least
thirty
or
forty
sharks
assembled
round
the
carcasses
and
as
we
towed
them
in
they
followed
when
we
had
grounded
them
in
the
shallow
water
close
to
the
beach
the
blubber
was
cut
off
after
which
the
flesh
was
given
to
the
black
people
who
assembled
in
crowds
and
cut
off
with
their
knives
large
portions
of
the
meat
the
sharks
as
liberally
helped
themselves
with
their
teeth
but
it
was
very
remarkable
that
though
the
black
men
often
came
between
them
and
the
whale
they
never
attacked
a
man
this
was
a
singular
scene
the
blacks
with
their
white
eyes
and
teeth
hallooing
laughing
screaming
and
mixing
with
numerous
sharks
the
most
ferocious
monsters
of
the
deep
yet
preserving
a
sort
of
truce
during
the
presence
of
a
third
object
it
reminded
me
comparing
great
things
with
small
of
the
partition
of
poland
i
found
that
there
was
neither
honour
nor
profit
for
me
in
this
diversion
so
i
no
more
went
a
whale
fishing
but
took
my
passage
to
halifax
in
a
schooner
one
of
those
vessels
built
during
the
war
in
imitation
of
the
virginia
pilot
boats
but
like
most
of
our
imitations
about
as
much
resembling
the
original
as
a
cow
is
like
a
hare
and
bearing
exactly
the
same
proportion
in
point
of
velocity
and
as
if
it
had
been
determined
that
these
vessels
should
in
every
respect
disgrace
the
british
flag
the
command
of
them
was
conferred
on
officers
whose
conduct
would
not
induce
captains
to
allow
them
to
serve
under
them
and
who
were
therefore
very
unwisely
sent
into
small
vessels
where
they
became
their
own
masters
and
were
many
of
them
constantly
drunk
such
was
the
state
of
my
commander
from
the
time
i
sailed
until
we
reached
halifax
the
example
of
the
lieutenant
was
followed
by
his
mate
and
three
midshipmen
the
crew
which
consisted
of
men
were
kept
sober
by
being
confined
to
their
allowance
and
i
had
a
hopeful
prospect
fortunately
drinking
was
not
among
my
vices
i
could
get
fresh
as
we
call
it
when
in
good
company
and
excited
by
wit
and
mirth
but
i
never
went
to
the
length
of
being
drunk
and
as
i
advanced
in
years
pride
and
cunning
made
me
still
more
guarded
i
perceived
the
immense
advantage
which
sobriety
gave
me
over
a
drunkard
and
i
failed
not
to
profit
by
it
keeping
constantly
on
deck
almost
night
and
day
i
attended
to
the
course
of
the
vessel
and
the
sail
she
carried
never
taking
the
trouble
to
consult
the
lieutenant
who
was
generally
senseless
in
his
cabin
we
made
sambro
lighthouse
which
is
at
the
entrance
of
halifax
harbour
in
the
evening
and
one
of
the
midshipmen
who
was
more
than
half
drunk
declared
himself
well
acquainted
with
the
place
and
his
offer
to
pilot
the
vessel
in
was
accepted
as
i
had
never
been
there
before
i
could
be
of
no
use
but
being
extremely
doubtful
of
the
skill
of
our
pilot
i
watched
his
proceedings
with
some
anxiety
in
half
an
hour
we
found
ourselves
on
shore
on
cornwallis
island
as
i
afterwards
learned
and
the
sea
made
a
fair
breach
over
us
this
sobered
the
lieutenant
and
his
officers
and
as
the
tide
fell
we
found
ourselves
high
and
dry
the
vessel
fell
over
on
her
side
and
i
walked
on
shore
determined
to
trust
myself
no
more
with
such
a
set
of
beasts
boats
came
down
from
the
dockyard
at
daylight
and
took
me
and
some
others
who
had
followed
my
example
together
with
our
luggage
to
the
after
two
days
hard
labour
the
vessel
was
got
off
and
brought
into
the
harbour
the
admiral
was
informed
of
the
whole
transaction
and
one
of
the
captains
advised
him
to
try
the
lieutenant
by
a
or
at
least
to
turn
him
out
of
the
vessel
and
send
him
home
unfortunately
he
would
not
follow
this
advice
but
sent
him
to
sea
again
with
despatches
it
was
known
that
all
hands
were
drunk
on
quitting
the
port
and
the
vessel
ran
upon
a
reef
of
rocks
called
the
sisters
where
she
sank
and
every
soul
perished
her
were
seen
just
above
water
the
next
morning
the
frigate
i
was
to
join
came
into
harbour
soon
after
i
reached
halifax
this
i
was
sorry
for
as
i
found
myself
in
very
good
quarters
i
had
letters
of
introduction
to
the
best
families
the
place
is
proverbial
for
hospitality
and
the
society
of
the
young
ladies
who
are
both
virtuous
and
lovely
tended
in
some
degree
to
reform
and
polish
the
rough
and
libertine
manners
which
i
had
contracted
in
my
career
i
had
many
sweethearts
but
they
were
more
like
emily
than
eugenia
i
was
a
great
flirt
among
them
and
would
willingly
have
spent
more
time
in
their
company
but
my
fate
or
fortune
was
to
be
accomplished
and
i
went
on
board
the
frigate
where
i
presented
my
introductory
letters
to
the
nobleman
who
commanded
her
i
expected
to
have
seen
an
effeminate
young
man
much
too
refined
to
learn
his
business
but
i
was
mistaken
lord
edward
was
a
sailor
every
inch
of
him
he
knew
a
ship
from
stem
to
stern
understood
the
characters
of
seamen
and
gained
their
confidence
he
was
besides
a
good
mechanic
a
carpenter
and
cooper
he
could
hand
reef
and
steer
knot
and
splice
but
he
was
no
orator
he
read
little
and
spoke
less
he
was
a
man
of
no
show
he
was
honest
and
unsophisticated
with
a
large
proportion
of
common
sense
he
was
and
free
with
his
officers
though
if
offended
he
was
violent
but
soon
calm
again
nor
could
you
ever
perceive
any
assumption
of
consequence
from
his
title
of
nobility
he
was
pleased
with
my
expertness
in
practical
seamanship
and
before
we
left
the
harbour
i
became
a
great
favourite
this
i
took
care
to
improve
as
i
liked
him
both
for
himself
and
his
good
qualities
independently
of
the
advantages
of
being
on
good
terms
with
the
captain
we
were
not
allowed
to
remain
long
in
this
paradise
of
sailors
being
ordered
suddenly
to
quebec
i
ran
round
to
say
adieu
to
all
my
dear
arcadian
friends
a
tearful
eye
a
lock
of
hair
a
hearty
shake
of
a
fair
hand
were
all
the
spoils
with
which
i
was
loaded
when
i
quitted
the
shore
and
i
cast
many
a
longing
lingering
look
behind
as
the
ship
glided
out
of
the
harbour
white
handkerchiefs
were
waved
from
the
beach
and
many
a
silent
prayer
put
up
for
our
safe
return
from
snowy
bosoms
and
from
aching
hearts
i
dispensed
my
usual
quantum
of
vows
of
eternal
love
and
fidelity
before
i
left
them
and
my
departure
was
marked
in
the
calendar
of
halifax
as
a
black
day
by
at
least
seven
or
eight
pairs
of
blue
eyes
we
had
not
been
long
at
sea
before
we
spoke
an
irish
guineaman
from
belfast
loaded
with
emigrants
for
the
united
states
i
think
about
seventeen
families
these
were
contraband
our
captain
had
some
twenty
thousand
acres
on
the
island
of
st
john
or
prince
edward
as
it
is
now
called
a
grant
to
some
of
his
ancestors
which
had
been
bequeathed
to
him
and
from
which
he
had
never
received
one
shilling
of
rent
for
the
very
best
reason
in
the
world
because
there
were
no
tenants
to
cultivate
the
soil
it
occurred
to
our
noble
captain
that
this
was
the
very
sort
of
cargo
he
wanted
and
that
these
irish
people
would
make
good
clearers
of
his
land
and
improve
his
estate
he
made
the
proposal
to
them
and
as
they
saw
no
chance
of
getting
to
the
united
states
and
provided
they
could
procure
nourishment
for
their
families
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
them
where
they
colonised
the
proposal
was
accepted
and
the
captain
obtained
permission
of
the
admiral
to
accompany
them
to
the
island
to
see
them
housed
and
settled
indeed
nothing
could
have
been
more
advantageous
for
all
parties
they
increased
the
scanty
population
of
our
own
colony
instead
of
adding
to
the
number
of
our
enemies
we
sailed
again
from
halifax
a
few
hours
after
we
had
obtained
the
sanction
of
the
admiral
and
passing
through
the
beautiful
passage
between
nova
scotia
and
the
island
of
cape
breton
known
by
the
name
of
the
gut
of
canso
we
soon
reached
prince
edward
island
we
anchored
in
a
small
harbour
near
the
estate
on
which
we
found
a
man
residing
with
his
wife
and
family
this
fellow
called
himself
the
steward
and
from
all
i
could
see
of
him
during
our
three
weeks
stay
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
rascal
enough
for
the
stewardship
of
any
nobleman
estate
in
england
the
captain
landed
and
took
me
as
his
a
bed
was
prepared
for
his
lordship
in
the
house
but
he
preferred
sleeping
on
clean
hay
in
the
barn
this
noble
lord
was
a
man
whose
thoughts
seldom
gave
much
labour
to
his
tongue
he
always
preferred
hearing
others
to
talking
himself
and
whoever
was
his
companion
he
must
always
be
at
the
expense
of
the
conversation
nor
was
it
by
the
usual
mode
of
simple
narrative
that
his
mind
was
completely
impressed
with
the
image
intended
to
be
presented
to
him
he
required
three
different
versions
or
paraphrases
of
the
same
story
or
observation
and
to
these
he
had
three
different
expletives
or
ejaculations
these
were
hum
eh
and
ah
the
first
denoted
attention
the
second
part
comprehension
and
the
third
assent
and
entire
approval
to
mark
which
more
distinctly
the
last
syllable
was
drawn
out
to
an
immoderate
length
and
accompanied
by
a
sort
of
half
laugh
i
shall
give
one
instance
of
our
colloquial
pastime
his
lordship
after
we
had
each
taken
up
our
quarters
for
the
night
on
the
soft
dry
hay
thus
began
i
say
a
pause
my
lord
what
would
they
say
in
england
at
our
taking
up
such
quarters
i
think
my
lord
that
as
far
as
regards
myself
they
would
say
nothing
but
as
far
as
regards
your
lordship
they
would
say
it
was
very
indifferent
accommodation
for
a
nobleman
hum
this
i
knew
was
the
signal
for
a
new
version
i
was
observing
my
lord
that
a
person
of
your
rank
taking
up
his
quarters
in
a
barn
would
excite
suspicion
among
your
friends
in
england
eh
says
his
lordship
that
did
not
do
either
your
lordship
head
or
mine
is
very
thick
thinks
i
try
again
though
dying
to
go
to
sleep
i
say
my
lord
if
the
people
in
england
knew
what
a
good
sailor
you
are
they
would
be
surprised
at
nothing
you
did
but
those
who
know
nothing
would
think
it
odd
that
you
should
be
contented
with
such
quarters
ah
said
his
lordship
triumphantly
what
further
observations
he
was
pleased
to
make
that
night
i
know
not
for
i
fell
fast
asleep
and
did
not
awake
till
the
cocks
and
hens
began
to
fly
down
from
their
roosts
and
make
a
confounded
clamour
for
their
breakfasts
when
his
lordship
jumped
up
gave
himself
a
good
shake
and
then
gave
me
another
of
a
different
sort
it
announced
the
purpose
however
of
restoring
me
to
that
reason
of
which
the
cackling
of
the
poultry
had
only
produced
the
incipient
signs
come
rouse
out
you
d
lazy
chap
said
my
captain
do
you
mean
to
sleep
all
day
we
have
got
plenty
to
do
ay
ay
my
lord
said
i
so
up
i
jumped
and
my
toilet
was
completed
in
the
same
time
and
by
the
same
operation
as
that
of
a
newfoundland
dog
namely
a
good
shake
a
large
party
of
the
ship
company
came
on
shore
with
the
carpenter
bringing
with
them
every
implement
useful
in
cutting
down
trees
and
building
such
was
to
be
our
occupation
in
order
to
house
these
poor
emigrants
our
men
began
to
clear
a
patch
of
land
by
cutting
down
a
number
of
the
almost
exclusive
natives
of
the
wood
and
having
selected
a
spot
for
the
foundation
we
placed
four
stems
of
trees
in
a
parallelogram
having
a
deep
notch
in
each
end
mutually
to
fit
and
embrace
each
other
when
the
walls
by
this
repeated
operation
were
high
enough
we
laid
on
the
rafters
and
covered
the
roof
with
boughs
of
the
fir
and
the
bark
of
the
filling
the
interstices
with
moss
and
mud
by
practice
i
became
a
very
expert
engineer
and
with
the
assistance
of
thirty
or
forty
men
i
could
build
a
very
good
house
in
a
day
we
next
cleared
by
burning
and
rooting
up
as
much
land
as
would
serve
to
sustain
the
little
colony
for
the
ensuing
season
and
having
planted
a
crop
of
corn
and
potatoes
and
given
the
settlers
many
articles
useful
in
their
new
abode
we
left
them
agreeably
to
our
orders
and
to
my
great
joy
returned
to
dear
halifax
where
i
again
was
blessed
with
the
sight
of
my
innocent
harem
i
remember
well
that
i
received
a
severe
rebuke
from
the
captain
for
inattention
to
signals
one
was
addressed
to
us
from
the
i
was
signal
midshipman
but
instead
of
directing
my
glass
towards
the
old
it
was
levelled
at
a
certain
young
calypso
whose
fair
form
i
discovered
wandering
along
the
how
long
would
i
not
have
dwelt
in
this
happy
arcadia
had
not
another
mentor
pushed
me
off
the
rocks
and
sent
me
once
more
to
buffet
the
briny
waves
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
any
rational
being
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
planning
a
war
against
england
and
every
ship
in
halifax
harbour
was
preparing
to
fight
the
yankees
the
squadron
sailed
in
september
i
bade
adieu
to
the
nymphs
of
nova
scotia
with
more
indifference
than
became
me
or
than
the
reception
i
had
met
with
from
them
seemed
to
deserve
but
i
was
the
same
selfish
and
ungrateful
being
as
ever
i
cared
for
no
one
but
my
own
dear
self
and
as
long
as
i
was
gratified
it
mattered
little
to
me
how
many
broken
hearts
i
left
behind

at

thunders

in

dryden
halifax
is
a
charming
hospitable
place
its
name
is
associated
with
so
many
pleasing
recollections
that
it
never
fails
to
extort
another
glass
from
the
bottle
which
having
been
gagged
was
going
to
pass
the
night
in
the
cellaret
but
only
say
halifax
and
it
is
like
open
sesame
out
flies
the
cork
and
down
goes
a
bumper
to
the
health
of
all
good
lasses
i
related
in
the
last
chapter
an
adventure
with
an
irish
guineaman
whose
cargo
my
right
honourable
captain
converted
to
the
profitable
uses
of
himself
and
his
country
another
of
these
vessels
had
been
fallen
in
with
by
one
of
our
cruisers
and
the
commander
of
his
majesty
sloop
the
made
a
selection
of
some
thirty
or
forty
stout
hibernians
to
fill
up
his
own
complement
and
hand
over
the
surplus
to
the
admiral
mortals
we
all
are
and
captains
of
are
not
exempted
from
this
human
imperfection
how
much
also
drops
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
there
chanced
to
be
on
board
of
the
same
trader
two
very
pretty
irish
girls
of
the
better
sort
of
they
were
going
to
join
their
friends
at
philadelphia
the
name
of
the
one
was
judy
and
of
the
other
maria
no
sooner
were
the
poor
irishmen
informed
of
their
change
of
destination
than
they
set
up
a
howl
loud
enough
to
make
the
scaly
monsters
of
the
deep
seek
their
dark
caverns
they
rent
the
hearts
of
the
poor
girls
and
when
the
thorough
bass
of
the
males
was
joined
by
the
sopranos
and
trebles
of
the
women
and
children
it
would
have
made
orpheus
himself
turn
round
and
gaze
oh
miss
judy
oh
miss
maria
would
ye
be
so
cruel
as
to
see
us
poor
craturs
dragged
away
to
a
and
not
for
to
go
and
spake
a
word
for
us
a
word
to
the
captain
wid
your
own
pretty
mouths
no
doubt
he
would
let
us
off
the
young
ladies
though
doubting
the
powers
of
their
own
fascinations
resolved
to
make
the
experiment
so
begging
the
lieutenant
of
the
sloop
to
give
them
a
passage
on
board
to
speak
with
his
captain
they
added
a
small
matter
of
finery
to
their
dress
and
skipped
into
the
boat
like
a
couple
of
mountain
kids
caring
neither
for
the
exposure
of
legs
nor
the
spray
of
the
salt
water
which
though
it
took
the
curls
out
of
their
hair
added
a
bloom
to
the
cheeks
which
perhaps
contributed
in
no
small
degree
to
the
success
of
their
project
there
is
something
in
the
sight
of
a
petticoat
at
sea
that
never
fails
to
put
a
man
into
a
good
humour
provided
he
be
rightly
constructed
when
they
got
on
board
the
they
were
received
by
the
captain
and
handed
down
into
the
cabin
where
some
refreshments
were
immediately
prepared
for
them
and
every
kind
attention
shown
which
their
sex
and
beauty
could
demand
the
captain
was
one
of
the
best
natured
fellows
that
ever
lived
with
a
pair
of
little
sparkling
black
eyes
that
laughed
in
your
face
and
pray
young
ladies
said
he
what
may
have
procured
me
the
honour
of
this
visit
it
was
to
beg
a
favour
of
your
honour
said
judy
and
his
honour
will
grant
it
too
said
maria
for
i
like
the
look
of
him
flattered
by
this
little
shot
of
maria
the
captain
said
that
nothing
ever
gave
him
more
pleasure
than
to
oblige
the
ladies
and
if
the
favour
they
intended
to
ask
was
not
utterly
incompatible
with
his
duty
that
he
would
grant
it
well
then
said
maria
will
your
honour
give
me
back
pat
flannagan
that
you
have
pressed
just
now
the
captain
shook
his
head
he
no
sailor
your
honour
but
a
poor
and
he
will
never
do
you
any
good
the
captain
again
shook
his
head
ask
me
anything
else
said
he
and
i
will
give
it
you
well
then
said
maria
give
us
felim
the
captain
was
equally
inflexible
come
come
your
honour
said
judy
we
must
not
stand
upon
trifles
nowadays
i
give
you
a
kiss
if
you
give
me
pat
flannagan
and
i
another
said
maria
for
felim
the
captain
had
one
seated
on
each
side
of
him
his
head
turned
like
a
in
a
gale
of
wind
he
did
not
know
which
to
begin
with
the
most
ineffable
good
humour
danced
in
his
eyes
and
the
ladies
saw
at
once
that
the
day
was
their
own
such
is
the
power
of
beauty
that
this
lord
of
the
ocean
was
fain
to
strike
to
it
judy
laid
a
kiss
on
his
right
cheek
maria
matched
it
on
his
left
the
captain
was
the
happiest
of
mortals
well
then
said
he
you
have
your
wish
take
your
two
men
for
i
am
in
a
hurry
to
make
sail
is
it
sail
ye
are
after
making
and
do
ye
mane
to
take
all
those
pretty
craturs
away
wid
ye
no
faith
another
kiss
and
another
man
i
am
not
going
to
relate
how
many
kisses
these
lovely
girls
bestowed
on
this
envied
captain
if
such
are
captain
perquisites
who
would
not
be
a
captain
suffice
it
to
say
they
released
the
whole
of
their
countrymen
and
returned
on
board
in
triumph
the
story
reached
halifax
where
the
admiral
only
said
he
was
sorry
he
was
not
a
captain
and
all
the
happy
society
made
themselves
very
merry
with
it
the
captain
who
is
as
brave
as
he
is
good
was
promoted
soon
after
entirely
from
his
own
intrinsic
merit
but
not
for
this
action
in
which
candour
and
friendship
must
acknowledge
he
was
defeated
the
used
to
say
he
always
laughed
at
the
settlement
of
as
ladies
were
either
kicked
out
of
it
or
kissed
out
of
it
but
his
lordship
in
the
whole
course
of
his
legal
practice
never
saw
a
captain
of
a
kissed
out
of
forty
men
by
two
pretty
irish
girls
after
this
who
would
not
shout
go
dashing
with
a
fine
breeze
out
of
the
harbour
i
saw
with
joy
the
field
of
fortune
open
to
me
holding
out
a
fair
promise
of
glory
and
riches
adieu
said
i
in
my
heart
adieu
ye
lovely
nova
scotians
learn
in
future
to
distinguish
between
false
glitter
and
real
worth
me
ye
prized
for
a
handsome
person
and
a
smooth
tongue
while
you
foolishly
rejected
men
of
ten
times
my
worth
because
they
wanted
the
outward
blandishments
we
were
ordered
to
bermuda
and
on
our
first
quitting
the
port
steered
away
to
the
southward
with
a
fair
wind
at
this
breeze
soon
freshened
into
a
gale
at
and
blew
with
some
violence
but
after
a
while
it
died
away
to
a
perfect
calm
leaving
a
heavy
swell
in
which
the
ship
rolled
incessantly
about
eleven
the
sky
began
to
blacken
and
before
noon
had
assumed
an
appearance
of
the
most
dismal
and
foreboding
darkness
the
screamed
as
they
flew
distractedly
by
warning
us
to
prepare
for
the
approaching
hurricane
whose
symptoms
could
hardly
be
mistaken
the
warning
was
not
lost
upon
us
most
of
our
sails
were
taken
in
and
we
had
as
we
thought
so
well
secured
everything
as
to
bid
defiance
to
the
storm
about
noon
it
came
with
a
sudden
and
terrific
violence
that
astonished
the
oldest
and
most
experienced
seaman
among
us
the
noise
it
made
was
horrible
and
its
ravages
inconceivable
the
wind
was
from
the
the
water
as
it
blew
on
board
and
all
over
us
was
warm
as
milk
the
murkiness
and
close
smell
of
the
air
was
in
a
short
time
dispelled
but
such
was
the
violence
of
the
wind
that
on
the
moment
of
its
striking
the
ship
she
lay
over
on
her
side
with
her
lee
guns
under
water
every
article
that
could
move
was
danced
to
leeward
the
shot
flew
out
of
the
lockers
and
the
greatest
confusion
and
dismay
prevailed
below
while
above
deck
things
went
still
worse
the
and
the
fore
and
main
topmast
went
over
the
side
but
such
was
the
noise
of
the
wind
that
we
could
not
hear
them
fall
nor
did
i
who
was
standing
close
to
the
at
the
moment
know
it
was
gone
until
i
turned
round
and
saw
the
stump
of
the
mast
snapped
in
two
like
a
carrot
the
noise
of
the
wind
waxed
louder
and
louder
it
was
like
one
continued
peal
of
thunder
and
the
enormous
waves
as
they
rose
were
instantly
beheaded
by
its
fury
and
sent
in
foaming
spray
along
the
bosom
of
the
deep
the
storm
flew
to
atoms
the
captain
officers
and
men
stood
aghast
looking
at
each
other
and
waiting
the
awful
event
in
utter
amazement
the
ship
lay
over
on
her
larboard
side
so
heavily
as
to
force
in
the
gun
ports
and
the
nettings
of
the
waist
hammocks
and
seemed
as
if
settling
bodily
down
while
large
masses
of
water
by
the
force
of
the
wind
were
whirled
up
into
the
air
and
others
were
pouring
down
the
hatchways
which
we
had
not
had
time
to
batten
down
and
before
we
had
succeeded
the
lower
deck
was
half
full
and
the
chests
and
hammocks
were
all
floating
about
in
dreadful
disorder
the
sheep
cow
pigs
and
poultry
were
all
washed
overboard
out
of
the
waist
and
drowned
no
voice
could
be
heard
and
no
orders
were
given
all
discipline
was
suspended
every
man
was
equal
to
his
neighbour
captain
and
sweeper
clung
alike
to
the
same
rope
for
security
the
carpenter
was
for
cutting
away
the
masts
but
the
captain
would
not
consent
a
seaman
crawled
aft
on
the
and
screaming
into
the
ear
of
the
captain
informed
him
that
one
of
the
anchors
had
broke
adrift
and
was
hanging
by
the
cable
under
the
bows
to
have
let
it
remain
long
in
this
situation
was
certain
destruction
to
the
ship
and
i
was
ordered
forward
to
see
it
cut
away
but
so
much
had
the
gale
and
the
sea
increased
in
a
few
minutes
that
a
passage
to
the
forecastle
was
not
to
be
found
on
the
weather
side
the
wind
and
sea
were
so
violent
that
no
man
could
face
them
i
was
blown
against
the
boats
and
with
difficulty
got
back
to
the
and
going
over
to
leeward
i
swam
along
the
gangway
under
the
lee
of
the
boats
and
delivered
the
orders
which
with
infinite
difficulty
at
last
were
executed
on
the
forecastle
i
found
the
oldest
and
stoutest
seamen
holding
on
by
the
weather
rigging
and
crying
like
children
i
was
surprised
at
this
and
felt
proud
to
be
above
such
weakness
while
my
superiors
in
age
and
experience
were
sinking
under
apprehension
i
was
aware
of
our
danger
and
saw
very
clearly
that
if
the
frigate
did
not
right
very
shortly
it
would
be
all
over
with
us
for
in
spite
of
our
precautions
the
water
was
increasing
below
i
swam
back
to
the
where
the
captain
who
was
as
brave
a
man
as
ever
trod
a
plank
stood
at
the
wheel
with
three
of
the
best
seamen
but
such
were
the
rude
shocks
which
the
rudder
received
from
the
sea
that
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
they
could
prevent
themselves
being
thrown
over
the
ship
side
the
lee
guns
were
under
water
but
it
was
proposed
to
throw
them
overboard
and
as
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
we
succeeded
still
she
lay
like
a
log
and
would
not
right
and
settled
down
in
a
very
alarming
manner
the
violence
of
the
hurricane
was
unabated
and
the
general
feeling
seemed
be
to
prayers
to
prayers
all
lost
the
fore
and
still
stood
supporting
the
weight
of
rigging
and
wreck
which
hung
to
them
and
which
like
a
powerful
lever
pressed
the
labouring
ship
down
on
her
side
to
disengage
this
enormous
top
hamper
was
to
us
an
object
more
to
be
desired
than
expected
yet
the
case
was
desperate
and
a
desperate
effort
was
to
be
made
or
in
half
an
hour
we
should
have
been
past
praying
for
except
by
a
roman
catholic
priest
the
danger
of
sending
a
man
aloft
was
so
imminent
that
the
captain
would
not
order
one
on
this
service
but
calling
the
ship
company
on
the
pointed
to
the
impending
wreck
and
by
signs
and
gestures
and
hard
bawling
convinced
them
that
unless
the
ship
was
immediately
eased
of
her
burden
she
must
go
down
at
this
moment
every
wave
seemed
to
make
a
deeper
and
more
fatal
impression
on
her
she
descended
rapidly
in
the
hollows
of
the
sea
and
rose
with
dull
and
exhausted
motion
as
if
she
felt
she
could
do
no
more
she
was
worn
out
in
the
contest
and
about
to
surrender
like
a
noble
and
battered
fortress
to
the
overwhelming
power
of
her
enemies
the
men
seemed
stupefied
with
the
danger
and
i
have
no
doubt
could
they
have
got
at
the
spirits
would
have
made
themselves
drunk
and
in
that
state
have
met
their
inevitable
fate
at
every
lurch
the
mainmast
appeared
as
if
making
the
most
violent
efforts
to
disengage
itself
from
the
ship
the
weather
shrouds
became
like
straight
bars
of
iron
while
the
lee
shrouds
hung
over
in
a
to
leeward
or
with
the
banged
against
the
mast
and
threatened
instant
destruction
each
moment
from
the
convulsive
jerks
we
expected
to
see
the
mast
fall
and
with
it
the
side
of
the
ship
to
be
beat
in
no
man
could
be
found
daring
enough
at
the
captain
request
to
venture
aloft
and
cut
away
the
wreck
of
the
mast
and
the
which
was
hanging
up
and
down
with
the
weight
of
the
and
topsail
yard
resting
upon
it
there
was
a
dead
and
stupid
pause
while
the
hurricane
if
any
thing
increased
in
violence
i
confess
that
i
felt
gratified
at
this
acknowledgment
of
a
danger
which
none
dare
face
i
waited
a
few
seconds
to
see
if
a
volunteer
would
step
forward
resolved
if
he
did
that
i
would
be
his
enemy
for
life
inasmuch
as
he
would
have
robbed
me
of
the
gratification
of
my
darling
passion
unbounded
pride
dangers
in
common
with
others
i
had
often
faced
and
been
the
first
to
encounter
but
to
dare
that
which
a
gallant
and
hardy
crew
of
a
frigate
had
declined
was
a
climax
of
superiority
which
i
had
never
dreamed
of
attaining
seizing
a
sharp
tomahawk
i
made
signs
to
the
captain
that
i
would
attempt
to
cut
away
the
wreck
follow
me
who
dared
i
mounted
the
five
or
six
hardy
seamen
followed
me
sailors
will
rarely
refuse
to
follow
where
they
find
an
officer
to
lead
the
way
the
jerks
of
the
rigging
had
nearly
thrown
us
overboard
or
jammed
us
with
the
wreck
we
were
forced
to
embrace
the
shrouds
with
arms
and
legs
and
anxiously
and
with
breathless
apprehension
for
our
lives
did
the
captain
officers
and
crew
gaze
on
us
as
we
mounted
and
cheered
us
at
every
stroke
of
the
tomahawk
the
danger
seemed
passed
when
we
reached
the
catharpens
where
we
had
foot
room
we
divided
our
work
some
took
the
lanyards
of
the
topmast
rigging
i
the
slings
of
the
the
lusty
blows
we
dealt
were
answered
by
corresponding
crashes
and
at
length
down
fell
the
tremendous
wreck
over
the
larboard
gunwale
the
ship
felt
instant
relief
she
righted
and
we
descended
amidst
the
cheers
the
applauses
the
congratulations
and
i
may
add
the
tears
of
gratitude
of
most
of
our
shipmates
the
work
now
become
lighter
the
gale
abated
every
moment
the
wreck
was
gradually
cleared
away
and
we
forgot
our
cares
this
was
the
proudest
moment
of
my
life
and
no
earthly
possession
would
i
have
taken
in
exchange
for
what
i
felt
when
i
once
more
placed
my
foot
on
the
the
approving
smile
of
the
captain
the
hearty
shake
by
the
hand
the
praises
of
the
officers
the
eager
gaze
of
the
ship
company
who
looked
on
me
with
astonishment
and
obeyed
me
with
alacrity
were
something
in
my
mind
when
abstractedly
considered
but
nothing
compared
to
the
inward
feeling
of
gratified
ambition
a
passion
so
intimately
interwoven
in
my
existence
that
to
have
eradicated
it
the
whole
fabric
of
my
frame
must
have
been
demolished
i
felt
pride
justified
hurricanes
are
rarely
of
long
continuance
this
was
succeeded
by
a
gale
which
though
strong
was
fine
weather
compared
to
what
we
had
seen
we
fell
to
work
rigged
our
and
in
a
few
days
presented
ourselves
to
the
welcome
gaze
of
the
town
of
halifax
which
having
felt
the
full
force
of
the
hurricane
expressed
very
considerable
alarm
for
our
safety
my
arms
and
legs
did
not
recover
for
some
time
from
the
effects
of
the
bruises
i
had
received
in
going
aloft
and
for
some
days
i
remained
on
board
when
i
recovered
i
went
on
shore
and
was
kindly
and
affectionately
received
by
my
numerous
friends
i
had
not
been
long
at
halifax
before
a
sudden
change
took
place
in
the
behaviour
of
my
captain
towards
me
the
cause
i
could
never
exactly
discover
though
i
had
given
myself
some
room
for
conjecture
i
must
confess
with
sorrow
that
notwithstanding
his
kindness
to
me
on
every
occasion
and
notwithstanding
my
high
respect
for
him
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
i
had
raised
a
laugh
against
him
but
he
was
too
a
man
to
be
offended
at
such
a
harmless
act
of
youthful
levity
and
five
minutes
were
usually
the
limits
of
anger
with
this
amiable
man
on
such
occasions
as
i
am
about
to
relate
the
fact
was
this
my
truly
noble
captain
sported
a
remarkable
wide
pair
of
blue
trowsers
whether
he
thought
it
or
whether
his
tailor
was
afraid
of
putting
his
lordship
to
short
allowance
of
cloth
for
fear
of
phlogistic
consequences
i
know
not
but
broad
as
was
the
beam
of
his
lordship
still
broader
and
more
ample
in
proportion
were
the
folds
of
this
essential
part
of
his
drapery
quite
enough
to
have
embraced
twice
the
volume
of
human
flesh
contained
within
them
large
as
it
undoubtedly
was
that
a
stitch
in
time
saves
nine
is
a
wise
saw
unhappily
like
many
others
of
the
same
thrifty
kind
but
little
heeded
in
this
our
day
so
it
was
with
lord
edward
a
rent
had
by
some
mischance
been
made
in
the
central
seam
and
on
the
morning
of
the
hurricane
was
still
unmended
when
the
gale
came
it
sought
a
quarrel
with
any
thing
it
could
lay
hold
of
and
the
harmless
trowsers
of
lord
edward
became
subject
to
its
mighty
and
resistless
devastation
the
blustering
boreas
entered
by
the
seam
aforesaid
and
filled
the
trowsers
like
the
cheeks
of
a
trumpeter
yorkshire
wool
could
not
stand
the
inflated
pressure
the
dress
split
to
ribbons
and
soundly
flagellated
the
very
part
it
was
intended
to
conceal
what
could
he
do
in
sweet
confusion
lost
and
dubious
the
only
defence
left
against
the
rude
blast
was
his
shirt
for
the
weather
was
so
warm
that
second
garments
were
dispensed
with
and
this
too
being
old
fled
in
tatters
before
the
gale
in
short
clap
a
sailor
jacket
on
the
gladiator
in
and
you
have
a
fair
view
of
lord
edward
in
the
hurricane
the
case
was
inconvenient
enough
but
as
the
ship
was
in
distress
and
we
all
expected
to
go
to
the
bottom
in
half
an
hour
it
was
not
worth
while
to
quit
the
deck
to
replace
the
dress
which
would
have
availed
him
nothing
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
particularly
as
we
were
not
likely
to
meet
with
any
ladies
there
nor
if
there
had
been
any
was
it
a
matter
of
any
moment
whether
we
went
to
davy
locker
with
or
without
breeches
but
when
the
danger
was
passed
the
joke
began
to
appear
and
i
was
amusing
a
large
company
with
the
when
his
lordship
came
in
the
titter
of
the
ladies
increased
to
a
giggle
and
then
by
regular
gradation
to
a
loud
and
uncontrollable
laugh
he
very
soon
discovered
that
he
was
the
subject
and
i
the
cause
and
for
a
minute
or
two
seemed
sulky
but
it
soon
went
off
and
i
can
not
think
this
was
the
reason
of
his
change
of
sentiments
for
although
it
is
high
treason
in
a
midshipman
to
look
black
at
the
captain
dog
much
less
to
laugh
at
the
captain
under
any
circumstances
still
i
knew
that
my
captain
was
too
good
a
fellow
to
be
offended
with
such
a
trifle
i
rather
suspect
i
was
wished
out
of
the
ship
by
the
first
lieutenant
and
officers
and
they
were
right
for
where
an
inferior
officer
is
popular
with
the
men
discipline
must
suffer
from
it
i
received
a
hint
from
lord
edward
that
another
captain
in
a
larger
frigate
would
be
happy
to
receive
me
i
understood
him
we
parted
good
friends
and
i
shall
ever
think
of
him
with
respect
and
gratitude
my
new
captain
was
a
very
different
sort
of
man
refined
in
his
manner
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
kind
and
friendly
with
his
officers
his
library
was
at
their
disposal
the
where
his
books
were
usually
kept
was
open
to
all
it
was
the
of
the
young
midshipmen
and
the
study
of
the
old
ones
he
was
an
excellent
draughtsman
and
i
profited
not
a
little
by
his
instructions
he
loved
the
society
of
the
ladies
so
did
i
but
he
being
a
married
man
was
more
select
in
his
company
and
more
correct
in
his
conduct
than
i
could
pretend
to
be
we
were
ordered
to
quebec
sailed
through
the
beautiful
gut
of
canso
and
up
the
spacious
and
majestic
st
lawrence
passing
in
sight
of
the
island
of
anticosta
nothing
material
occurred
during
the
passage
save
that
a
scotch
having
adopted
certain
aristocratic
notions
required
a
democratical
lecture
on
heads
which
was
duly
administered
to
him
he
pretended
that
he
was
by
birth
and
education
at
edinburgh
entitled
to
be
at
the
head
of
our
mess
this
i
resisted
and
soon
taught
the
ambitious
son
of
esculapius
that
the
science
of
defence
was
as
important
as
the
art
of
healing
and
that
if
he
was
skilful
in
this
latter
i
would
give
him
an
opportunity
of
employing
it
on
his
own
person
whereupon
i
implanted
on
his
cinciput
occiput
os
frontis
os
nasi
and
all
other
vulnerable
parts
of
his
body
certain
concussions
calculated
to
stupify
and
benumb
the
censorium
and
to
produce
under
each
eye
a
quantity
of
black
extravasated
blood
while
at
the
same
time
a
copious
stream
of
carmine
fluid
issued
from
either
nostril
it
was
never
my
habit
to
bully
or
take
any
unfair
advantage
so
having
perceived
a
cessation
of
arms
on
his
part
i
put
the
usual
interrogatives
as
to
whether
the
party
contending
was
satisfied
and
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
i
laid
by
my
metacarpal
bones
until
they
might
be
farther
wanted
either
for
reproof
or
correction
we
anchored
off
cape
diamond
which
divides
the
st
lawrence
from
the
little
river
st
charles
the
continuation
of
this
cape
as
it
recedes
forms
the
heights
of
abraham
on
which
the
immortal
wolfe
defeated
montcalm
in
the
year
when
both
the
generals
ended
their
glorious
career
on
the
field
of
battle
the
city
stands
on
the
extremity
of
the
cape
and
has
a
very
romantic
appearance
the
houses
and
churches
are
generally
covered
with
tin
to
prevent
conflagration
to
which
this
place
was
remarkably
subject
when
the
houses
were
covered
with
thatch
or
shingle
when
the
rays
of
the
sun
lay
on
the
buildings
they
had
the
appearance
of
being
cased
in
silver
one
of
our
objects
in
going
to
quebec
was
to
procure
men
of
which
the
squadron
was
very
deficient
our
seamen
and
marines
were
secretly
and
suddenly
formed
into
the
command
of
one
of
them
was
conferred
on
me
the
officers
and
marines
went
on
shore
in
disguise
having
agreed
on
private
signals
and
places
of
rendezvous
while
the
seamen
on
whom
we
could
depend
acted
as
decoy
ducks
pretending
to
belong
to
merchant
vessels
of
which
their
officer
was
the
master
and
inducing
them
to
engage
for
ten
gallons
of
rum
and
three
hundred
dollars
to
take
the
run
home
many
were
procured
in
this
manner
and
were
not
undeceived
until
they
found
themselves
alongside
of
the
frigate
when
their
oaths
and
execrations
may
be
better
conceived
than
described
or
repeated
it
may
be
proper
to
explain
here
that
the
vessels
employed
in
the
timber
trade
arrive
in
the
month
of
june
as
soon
as
the
ice
is
clear
of
the
river
and
if
they
do
not
sail
by
or
before
the
end
of
october
are
usually
set
fast
in
the
ice
and
forced
to
winter
in
the
st
lawrence
losing
their
voyage
and
lying
seven
or
eight
months
idle
aware
of
this
the
sailors
as
soon
as
they
arrive
desert
and
are
secreted
and
fed
by
the
crimps
who
make
their
market
of
them
in
the
fall
of
the
year
by
selling
them
to
the
captains
procuring
for
the
men
an
exorbitant
sum
for
the
voyage
home
and
for
themselves
a
handsome
for
their
trouble
both
from
the
captain
and
the
sailor
we
were
desired
not
to
take
men
out
of
the
merchant
vessels
but
to
search
for
them
in
the
houses
of
the
crimps
this
was
to
us
a
source
of
great
amusement
and
singular
adventure
for
the
ingenuity
in
concealing
them
was
only
equalled
by
the
art
and
cunning
exercised
in
the
discovery
of
their
abodes
cellars
and
lofts
were
stale
and
out
of
use
we
found
more
game
in
the
interior
of
haystacks
church
steeples
closets
under
fireplaces
where
the
fire
was
burning
some
we
found
headed
up
in
and
some
concealed
within
bundles
of
sometimes
we
found
seamen
dressed
as
gentlemen
drinking
wine
and
talking
with
the
greatest
familiarity
with
people
much
above
them
in
rank
who
had
used
these
means
to
conceal
them
our
information
led
us
to
detect
these
excusable
impositions
i
went
into
the
country
about
fifteen
miles
from
quebec
where
i
had
heard
of
a
crimp
preserve
and
after
a
tedious
search
discovered
some
good
seamen
on
the
rafters
of
an
outhouse
intended
only
to
smoke
and
cure
bacon
and
as
the
fires
were
lighted
and
the
smoke
ascending
it
was
difficult
to
conceive
a
human
being
could
exist
there
nor
should
we
have
discovered
them
if
one
of
them
had
not
coughed
on
which
he
received
the
execrations
of
the
others
and
the
whole
party
was
instantly
handed
out
we
immediately
cut
the
strings
of
their
trowsers
behind
to
prevent
their
running
away
this
ought
never
to
be
omitted
and
placing
them
and
ourselves
in
the
waggon
made
him
put
his
team
to
and
drive
us
all
to
quebec
the
men
joining
with
our
own
in
all
the
jokes
which
flew
thick
about
on
the
occasion
of
their
discovery
it
was
astonishing
to
me
how
easily
these
fine
fellows
reconciled
themselves
to
the
thoughts
of
a
perhaps
the
approaching
row
with
the
yankees
tended
very
much
to
preserve
good
humour
i
became
an
enthusiast
in
although
sober
reflection
has
since
convinced
me
of
its
cruelty
injustice
and
inexpediency
tending
to
drive
seamen
from
the
country
more
than
any
measure
the
government
could
adopt
but
i
am
not
going
to
write
a
treatise
on
impressment
i
cared
not
one
farthing
about
the
liberty
of
the
subject
as
long
as
i
got
my
ship
well
manned
for
the
impending
conflict
and
as
i
gratified
my
love
of
adventure
i
was
as
thoughtless
of
the
consequences
as
when
i
rode
over
a
farmer
turnips
in
england
or
broke
through
his
hedges
in
pursuit
of
a
fox
a
tradesman
at
quebec
had
affronted
me
by
refusing
to
discount
a
bill
which
i
had
drawn
on
my
father
i
had
no
other
means
of
paying
him
for
the
goods
i
had
purchased
of
him
and
was
much
disconcerted
at
his
refusal
which
he
accompanied
with
an
insult
to
myself
and
my
cloth
never
to
be
forgotten
turning
the
paper
over
and
over
he
said
a
midshipman
bill
is
not
worth
a
farthing
and
i
am
too
old
a
bird
to
be
caught
with
such
chaff
conscious
that
the
bill
was
good
i
vowed
revenge
my
enabled
me
to
go
wherever
i
could
get
information
of
men
being
concealed
this
was
easily
obtained
from
a
brother
mid
the
poor
man
might
as
well
have
been
in
the
hands
of
the
holy
brotherhood
my
companion
stated
his
firm
conviction
that
sailors
were
concealed
in
the
house
i
applied
to
the
captain
and
received
orders
to
proceed
by
all
means
in
execution
of
my
duty
the
tradesman
was
a
man
of
consequence
in
quebec
being
what
is
there
called
a
large
storekeeper
though
we
in
england
should
have
called
him
a
shopkeeper
about
one
in
the
morning
we
hammered
at
his
door
with
no
gentle
tap
demanding
admittance
in
the
name
of
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
we
were
refused
and
forthwith
broke
open
the
door
and
spread
over
his
house
like
a
nest
of
cockroaches
cellars
garrets
maids
room
ladies
rooms
we
entered
paid
little
regard
to
the
medicean
costume
of
the
fair
occupants
broke
some
of
the
most
indispensable
articles
of
bedroom
furniture
rattled
the
pots
and
pans
about
in
the
kitchen
and
finding
the
two
sons
of
the
master
of
the
house
ordered
them
to
dress
and
come
with
us
certain
we
said
that
they
were
sailors
when
the
old
tradesman
saw
me
he
began
to
smell
a
rat
and
threatened
me
with
severe
punishment
i
shewed
him
my
and
asked
him
if
it
was
a
after
having
inspected
every
part
of
the
house
i
departed
leaving
the
two
young
cubs
half
dead
with
fear
the
next
day
a
complaint
was
lodged
at
the
but
investigation
is
a
long
word
when
a
is
ordered
on
service
despatches
from
albany
reached
quebec
stating
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
had
declared
war
against
england
in
consequence
of
which
our
captain
took
leave
of
the
governor
and
dropped
down
the
river
with
all
speed
so
i
never
heard
any
more
of
my
tradesman
we
arrived
at
halifax
full
manned
and
immediately
received
orders
to
proceed
to
sea
to
sink
burn
and
destroy
we
ran
for
boston
bay
when
on
the
morning
we
made
the
land
we
discovered
ten
or
twelve
sail
of
merchant
vessels
the
first
we
boarded
was
a
brig
one
of
our
boats
was
lowered
down
i
got
into
her
and
jumped
on
the
deck
of
the
yankee
while
the
frigate
continued
in
chase
of
the
others
the
master
of
the
vessel
sat
on
a
and
did
not
condescend
to
rise
or
offer
me
the
least
salute
as
i
passed
him
he
was
a
short
thick
fellow
you
are
an
englishman
i
guess
i
guess
i
am
i
said
imitating
him
with
a
nasal
twang
i
thought
we
should
be
long
in
our
waters
afore
we
met
some
of
you
sarpents
no
harm
in
what
i
said
i
hope
added
the
master
oh
no
said
i
not
the
least
it
will
make
no
difference
in
the
long
run
but
where
do
you
come
from
and
where
are
you
bound
come
from
smyrna
and
bound
to
boston
where
i
hope
to
be
morning
by
the
blessing
of
god
and
a
good
conscience
from
this
answer
i
perceived
that
he
was
unacquainted
with
the
war
and
i
therefore
determined
to
play
with
him
a
little
before
i
gave
him
the
fatal
news
and
pray
said
i
what
might
your
cargo
consist
of
you
appear
to
be
light
not
so
light
neither
i
guess
said
the
man
we
have
sweet
oil
raisins
and
what
we
calls
notions
i
have
no
notion
said
i
what
they
might
be
pray
explain
yourself
why
you
see
notions
is
what
we
call
a
little
of
all
sorts
like
some
likes
one
thing
you
know
and
some
another
some
likes
sweet
almonds
and
some
likes
silk
and
some
likes
opium
and
some
he
added
with
a
cunning
grin
likes
dollars
and
are
these
the
notions
with
which
you
are
loaded
said
i
i
guess
they
are
replied
jonathan
and
what
might
your
outward
cargo
have
been
said
i
salt
fish
flour
and
tobacco
was
his
answer
and
is
this
all
you
have
in
return
i
asked
i
thought
the
smyrna
trade
had
been
a
very
good
one
well
so
it
is
said
the
unwary
yankee
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
the
cabin
besides
the
oil
and
the
rest
of
the
goods
a
no
bad
thing
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
of
the
dollars
said
i
what
odds
does
that
make
to
you
said
the
captain
it
wo
be
much
on
as
come
to
your
share
more
than
you
may
think
said
i
have
you
heard
the
news
as
you
came
along
at
the
word
news
the
poor
man
face
became
the
colour
of
one
in
the
jaundice
what
news
said
he
in
a
state
of
trepidation
that
hardly
admitted
of
utterance
why
only
that
your
president
mr
madison
has
thought
fit
to
declare
war
against
england
you
only
a
joking
said
the
captain
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
am
serious
said
i
and
your
vessel
is
a
prize
to
his
britannic
majesty
ship
the
the
poor
man
fetched
a
sigh
from
the
waistband
of
his
trowsers
i
am
a
ruined
man
said
he
i
only
wish
i
known
a
little
sooner
of
the
war
you
talk
about
i
got
two
nice
little
guns
there
forward
you
should
a
had
me
so
easily
i
smiled
at
his
idea
of
resistance
against
a
frigate
of
fifty
guns
but
left
him
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
his
conceit
and
changing
the
subject
asked
if
he
had
any
thing
he
could
give
us
to
drink
for
the
weather
was
very
warm
no
i
he
replied
peevishly
and
if
i
had
come
come
my
good
fellow
said
i
you
forget
you
are
a
prize
civility
is
a
cheap
article
and
may
bring
you
a
quick
return
that
true
said
jonathan
who
was
touched
on
the
nicest
point
self
that
true
you
are
only
a
doing
your
duty
here
boy
fetch
up
that
ere
demi
john
of
madeira
and
for
aught
i
know
the
young
officer
might
like
a
drop
o
long
cork
bring
us
some
tumblers
and
one
o
they
claret
bottles
out
o
the
starboard
after
locker
the
boy
obeyed
and
the
articles
quickly
appeared
while
this
dialogue
was
going
on
the
frigate
was
in
chase
firing
guns
and
the
different
vessels
as
she
passed
them
dropping
a
boat
on
board
of
one
and
making
sail
after
another
we
stood
after
her
with
all
the
sail
we
could
conveniently
carry
pray
said
the
captain
might
i
offer
you
a
bit
of
something
to
eat
i
guess
you
dined
yet
as
it
is
quite
meridian
i
thanked
him
and
accepted
his
offer
he
ran
down
instantly
to
the
cabin
as
if
to
prepare
for
my
reception
but
i
rather
thought
he
wished
to
place
some
articles
out
of
my
sight
and
this
proved
to
be
the
case
for
he
stole
a
bag
of
dollars
out
of
the
cargo
in
a
short
time
i
was
invited
down
a
leg
of
cured
pork
and
a
roasted
fowl
were
very
acceptable
to
a
midshipman
at
any
time
but
particularly
so
to
me
and
when
accompanied
by
a
few
glasses
of
the
madeira
the
barometer
of
my
spirits
rose
in
proportion
to
the
depression
of
his
come
captain
said
i
filling
a
bumper
of
claret
here
to
a
long
and
bloody
war
d
n
the
dog
that
wo
say
amen
to
that
said
the
master
but
where
do
you
mean
to
carry
me
to
i
guess
to
halifax
i
have
my
clothes
and
my
own
private
all
your
private
property
said
i
will
be
held
sacred
but
your
vessel
and
cargo
are
ours
well
well
said
the
man
i
know
that
but
if
you
behave
well
to
me
you
find
i
ungrateful
let
me
have
my
things
and
give
you
a
bit
o
news
as
will
be
of
sarvice
to
you
he
then
told
me
on
my
promising
him
his
private
venture
that
we
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
for
that
a
vessel
just
visible
on
the
horizon
was
from
smyrna
richly
laden
she
was
commanded
by
a
townsman
of
his
and
bound
to
the
same
place
i
turned
from
him
with
contempt
and
at
the
same
moment
made
the
signal
to
speak
the
frigate
on
going
on
board
i
told
the
captain
what
i
had
heard
from
the
master
of
the
prize
and
the
promise
i
had
given
he
approved
of
it
the
proper
number
of
men
were
instantly
sent
back
to
the
brig
the
prisoners
taken
out
and
the
frigate
made
sail
in
chase
of
the
indicated
vessel
which
she
captured
that
night
at
nine
i
would
not
willingly
believe
that
such
perfidy
is
common
among
the
americans
on
parting
with
the
master
of
my
brig
a
sharp
dialogue
took
place
between
us
i
guess
i
fit
out
a
privateer
and
take
some
o
your
merchanters
take
care
you
are
not
taken
yourself
said
i
and
pass
your
time
on
board
one
of
our
prison
ships
but
remember
whatever
may
happen
it
all
your
own
fault
you
have
picked
a
german
quarrel
with
us
to
please
boney
and
he
will
only
spit
in
your
face
when
you
have
done
your
best
for
him
your
wise
president
has
declared
war
against
the
mother
country
d
n
the
mother
country
muttered
the
yankee
i
guess
you
mean
tarnation
seize
her
we
continued
following
the
ship
and
by
the
frigate
had
secured
eight
prizes
one
of
them
being
a
brig
in
ballast
the
prisoners
were
put
on
board
of
her
my
yankee
friend
among
the
number
and
turned
adrift
to
find
their
way
home
we
took
care
to
give
to
all
of
them
their
private
ventures
and
their
clothes
i
was
in
hopes
of
being
allowed
to
go
to
halifax
with
my
prize
but
the
captain
knowing
how
i
was
likely
to
pass
my
time
kept
me
with
him
we
cruised
two
months
taking
many
privateers
some
large
and
some
small
some
we
burned
and
some
we
scuttled
one
day
we
had
one
of
these
craft
alongside
and
having
taken
every
thing
out
of
her
that
was
worth
moving
we
very
imprudently
set
her
on
fire
before
she
was
clear
of
the
ship
side
and
as
we
were
on
a
wind
it
was
some
minutes
before
we
could
get
her
clear
in
the
meantime
the
fire
began
to
blaze
up
in
a
very
alarming
manner
under
the
mizzen
chains
where
by
the
attraction
of
the
two
floating
bodies
she
seemed
resolved
to
continue
but
on
our
putting
the
helm
up
and
giving
the
vessel
a
sheer
the
contrary
way
as
soon
as
we
were
before
the
wind
she
parted
from
us
to
our
great
joy
and
was
soon
in
a
volume
of
flame
our
reason
for
setting
her
on
fire
alongside
was
to
save
time
as
we
wanted
to
go
in
chase
of
another
vessel
seen
from
the
and
lowering
a
boat
down
to
destroy
this
vessel
would
have
detained
us
before
the
end
of
the
cruise
we
chased
a
schooner
which
ran
on
shore
and
bilged
we
boarded
her
brought
away
her
crew
and
part
of
her
cargo
which
was
very
valuable
she
was
from
bordeaux
bound
to
philadelphia
i
was
sent
to
examine
her
and
endeavour
to
bring
away
more
of
her
cargo
the
tide
rising
in
her
we
were
compelled
to
rip
up
her
decks
and
discovered
that
she
was
laden
with
bales
of
silk
broad
cloths
watches
clocks
laces
silk
stockings
wine
brandy
bars
of
steel
c
i
sent
word
of
this
to
the
captain
and
the
carpenter
and
plenty
of
assistants
arriving
we
rescued
a
great
quantity
of
the
goods
from
the
deep
or
the
yankee
boats
who
would
soon
have
been
on
board
after
we
left
her
we
could
perceive
in
the
hold
some
cases
but
they
were
at
least
four
feet
under
water
it
was
confoundedly
cold
but
i
thought
there
was
something
worth
diving
for
so
down
i
went
and
contrived
to
keep
myself
long
enough
under
water
to
hook
one
end
of
a
case
by
which
means
we
broke
it
out
and
got
it
up
it
was
excellent
claret
and
we
were
not
withheld
from
drinking
it
by
any
scruples
of
conscience
for
if
i
had
not
dived
for
it
it
would
never
have
come
to
the
mouth
of
an
englishman
we
discussed
a
case
among
just
so
many
of
us
in
a
reasonable
short
time
and
as
it
was
october
we
felt
no
ill
effects
from
a
frequent
repetition
of
the
dose
i
never
felt
colder
and
diving
requires
much
stimulant
from
practice
at
this
work
i
could
pick
up
pins
and
needles
in
a
clear
sandy
bottom
and
considering
the
density
of
the
medium
could
live
like
a
beaver
under
water
but
i
required
ample
fees
for
my
trouble
when
we
returned
on
board
we
were
very
wet
and
cold
and
the
wine
took
no
effect
on
us
but
as
soon
as
we
thawed
like
the
horn
of
the
great
munchausen
the
secret
escaped
for
we
were
all
tipsy
the
captain
inquired
the
cause
of
this
the
next
day
and
i
very
candidly
told
him
the
whole
history
he
was
wise
enough
to
laugh
at
it
some
captains
would
have
flogged
every
one
of
the
men
and
disgraced
the
officers
on
our
return
into
port
i
requested
permission
to
go
to
england
in
order
to
pass
my
examination
as
lieutenant
having
nearly
completed
my
servitude
as
a
midshipman
i
was
asked
to
remain
out
and
take
my
chance
for
promotion
in
the
but
more
reasons
than
i
chose
to
give
induced
me
to
prefer
an
examination
at
a
in
england
and
i
obtained
my
discharge
and
came
home
the
reader
will
no
doubt
give
me
credit
for
having
written
some
dozen
of
letters
to
eugenia
youth
beauty
and
transient
possession
had
still
preserved
my
attachment
to
her
unabated
emily
i
had
heard
of
and
still
loved
with
a
purer
flame
she
was
my
sun
eugenia
my
moon
and
the
fair
favourites
of
the
western
hemisphere
so
many
twinkling
stars
of
the
first
second
and
third
magnitude
i
loved
them
all
more
or
less
but
all
their
charms
vanished
when
the
beauteous
emily
shone
in
my
breast
with
refulgent
light
i
had
received
letters
from
my
father
who
wished
me
to
come
home
that
he
might
present
me
to
some
of
the
great
men
of
the
nation
and
secure
my
promotion
to
the
highest
ranks
of
the
service
this
advice
was
good
and
as
it
suited
my
views
i
followed
it
i
parted
with
my
captain
on
the
best
terms
took
leave
of
all
my
messmates
and
the
officers
in
the
same
friendly
manner
and
last
not
least
went
round
to
the
ladies
kissing
hugging
crying
and
swearing
love
and
eternal
attachment
nothing
i
declared
should
keep
me
from
halifax
as
soon
as
i
had
passed
nothing
prevent
my
marrying
one
as
soon
as
i
was
a
lieutenant
a
second
was
to
have
the
connubial
knot
tied
when
i
was
a
commander
and
a
third
as
soon
as
i
was
made
a
captain
oh
how
like
was
i
to
don
galaor
oh
how
unlike
the
constant
amadis
de
gaul
but
reader
you
must
take
me
as
i
was
not
as
i
ought
to
have
been
after
a
passage
of
six
weeks
i
arrived
at
plymouth
and
had
exactly
completed
my
six
years
servitude
chapter
xv

him

goodman

spare
him
not
ask
him
impossible
questions
let
us

beaumont
and
fletcher
soon
after
my
arrival
at
plymouth
notice
was
given
by
a
general
order
issued
from
the
that
a
for
the
examination
of
midshipmen
as
touching
their
qualifications
for
the
rank
of
lieutenant
would
be
held
on
board
the
del
in
hamoaze
i
lost
no
time
in
acquainting
my
father
with
this
and
telling
him
that
i
felt
quite
prepared
and
meant
to
offer
myself
accordingly
on
the
day
appointed
your
humble
servant
with
some
fourteen
or
fifteen
other
youthful
aspirants
assembled
on
board
the
each
was
dressed
out
in
our
no
i
suits
in
most
exact
and
unquizzable
uniform
with
a
large
bundle
of
under
our
arms
we
were
all
huddled
together
in
a
small
screened
canvas
cabin
like
so
many
sheep
ready
for
slaughter
about
eleven
the
captains
who
were
to
be
our
minos
and
our
rhadamanthus
made
their
appearance
and
we
all
agreed
that
we
did
not
much
like
the
cut
of
their
jibs
at
twelve
the
first
name
was
called
the
desperate
youth
tried
to
pluck
up
a
little
courage
he
cleared
his
throat
pulled
up
his
shirt
collar
touched
his
and
seizing
his
cocked
hat
and
journals
boldly
followed
the
messenger
into
the
captain
cabin
where
three
gentlemen
in
undress
uniform
awaited
him
they
were
seated
at
a
round
table
a
clerk
was
at
the
elbow
of
the
president
moore
navigation
that
wise
redoubtable
lay
before
them
together
with
a
nautical
almanack
a
slate
and
pencil
ink
and
paper
the
trembling
middy
advanced
to
the
table
and
having
most
respectfully
deposited
his
journals
and
certificates
of
sobriety
and
good
conduct
was
desired
to
sit
down
the
first
questions
were
merely
theoretical
and
although
in
the
or
in
any
other
company
he
would
have
acquitted
himself
with
ease
he
was
so
abashed
and
confounded
that
he
lost
his
head
entirely
trembled
at
the
first
question
stared
at
the
second
and
having
no
answer
to
make
to
the
third
was
dismissed
with
directions
to
go
to
sea
six
months
longer
he
returned
to
us
with
a
most
countenance
i
never
saw
a
poor
creature
in
greater
mental
torment
i
felt
for
him
the
more
as
i
knew
not
how
soon
his
case
might
be
my
own
another
was
called
and
soon
returned
with
no
better
success
and
the
description
he
gave
of
the
bullying
conduct
of
the
youngest
passing
captain
was
such
as
to
damp
the
spirits
and
enough
to
stultify
minds
so
inexperienced
as
ours
and
where
so
much
depended
on
our
success
this
hint
was
however
of
great
use
to
me
theory
i
found
was
the
rock
on
which
they
had
split
and
in
this
part
of
my
profession
i
knew
my
powers
and
was
resolved
not
to
be
bowled
out
by
the
young
captain
but
while
i
thus
resolved
a
third
candidate
was
returned
to
us
and
this
was
a
young
man
on
whose
talents
i
could
have
relied
i
began
to
doubt
myself
when
the
fourth
came
out
with
a
smiling
face
and
told
us
he
had
passed
i
took
a
little
breath
but
even
this
comfort
was
snatched
from
me
in
a
moment
by
his
saying
that
one
of
the
passing
captains
was
a
friend
of
his
father
here
then
was
solved
an
enigma
for
this
fellow
during
the
short
time
i
was
in
his
company
gave
proof
of
being
no
better
than
a
simpleton
on
my
own
name
being
called
i
felt
a
flutter
about
the
heart
which
i
did
not
feel
in
action
or
in
the
hurricane
or
when
in
a
case
more
desperate
than
either
i
jumped
overboard
at
spithead
to
swim
to
my
dear
eugenia
powers
of
impudence
as
well
as
algebra
said
i
lend
me
your
aid
or
i
am
undone
in
a
moment
the
cabin
door
flew
open
the
sentinel
closed
it
after
me
and
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
this
most
awful
triumvirate
i
felt
very
like
daniel
in
the
den
i
was
desired
to
take
a
chair
and
a
short
discussion
ensued
between
the
judges
which
i
neither
heard
nor
wished
to
hear
but
while
it
lasted
i
had
time
to
survey
my
antagonists
from
head
to
foot
i
encouraged
myself
to
think
that
i
was
equal
to
one
of
them
and
if
i
could
only
neutralise
him
i
thought
i
should
very
easily
floor
the
other
two
one
of
these
officers
had
a
face
like
a
painted
pumpkin
and
his
hand
as
it
lay
on
the
table
looked
more
like
the
fin
of
a
turtle
the
nails
were
bitten
so
close
off
that
the
very
remains
of
them
seemed
to
have
retreated
into
the
flesh
for
fear
of
farther
depredation
which
the
other
hand
was
at
the
moment
suffering
thinks
i
to
myself
if
ever
i
saw
to
let
unfurnished
it
is
in
that
or
pumpkin
or
gourd
of
yours
the
next
captain
to
him
was
a
little
thin
dark
dried
up
shrivelled
fellow
with
keen
eyes
and
a
sharp
nose
the
midshipmen
called
him
old
chili
vinegar
or
old
hot
and
sour
he
was
what
we
term
a
martinet
he
would
keep
a
man
two
months
on
his
black
list
giving
him
a
breech
of
a
gun
to
polish
and
keep
bright
never
allowing
him
time
to
mend
his
clothes
or
keep
himself
clean
while
he
was
cleaning
that
which
for
all
the
purposes
of
war
had
better
have
been
black
he
seldom
flogged
a
man
but
he
tormented
him
into
sullen
discontent
by
what
he
called
keeping
the
devil
out
of
his
mind
this
little
who
looked
like
a
dried
i
soon
found
was
the
leader
of
the
band
the
third
captain
was
a
tall
pompous
man
he
was
the
junior
officer
of
the
three
with
a
commanding
and
most
unbending
countenance
he
would
not
ope
his
mouth
in
way
of
smile
though
nestor
swore
the
jest
was
laughable
i
had
just
time
to
finish
my
survey
and
form
a
rough
estimate
of
the
qualities
of
my
examiners
when
i
was
put
upon
my
trial
by
the
president
who
thus
addressed
me
you
are
perfect
in
the
theory
of
navigation
i
presume
sir
or
you
would
not
come
here
i
replied
that
i
hoped
i
should
be
found
so
if
they
would
please
to
try
me
ready
enough
with
his
answer
said
the
tall
captain
i
daresay
this
fellow
is
in
the
who
did
you
serve
your
time
with
sir
i
stated
the
different
captains
i
had
served
with
particularly
lord
edward
oh
ay
that
enough
you
be
a
smart
fellow
if
you
have
served
with
lord
edward
i
understood
the
envious
and
sarcastic
manner
in
which
this
was
uttered
and
prepared
accordingly
for
an
arduous
campaign
quite
sure
that
this
man
who
was
no
seaman
would
have
been
too
happy
in
turning
back
one
of
lord
edward
midshipmen
several
problems
were
given
to
me
which
i
readily
solved
and
returned
to
them
they
examined
my
logs
and
certificates
with
much
seeming
scrutiny
and
then
ventured
a
question
in
the
higher
branches
of
mathematics
this
i
also
solved
but
i
found
talent
was
not
exactly
what
they
wanted
the
little
skinny
captain
seemed
rather
disappointed
that
he
could
not
find
fault
with
me
a
difficult
problem
in
spherical
trigonometry
lay
before
them
carefully
drawn
out
and
the
result
distinctly
marked
at
the
bottom
but
this
i
was
not
of
course
permitted
to
see
i
soon
answered
the
question
they
compared
my
work
with
that
which
had
been
prepared
for
them
and
as
they
did
not
exactly
agree
i
was
told
that
i
was
wrong
i
was
not
disconcerted
and
very
deliberately
looking
over
my
work
i
told
them
i
could
not
discover
any
error
and
was
able
to
prove
it
by
inspection
by
canon
by
gunter
or
by
figure
you
think
yourself
a
very
clever
fellow
i
dare
say
said
the
little
fat
captain
a
second
euclid
said
the
tall
captain
pray
sir
do
you
know
the
meaning
of
bridge
of
asses
sir
said
i
staring
him
full
in
the
face
with
a
smile
under
the
skin
now
it
was
very
clear
to
me
that
the
little
fat
captain
had
never
heard
of
the
asses
bridge
before
and
therefore
supposed
i
was
quizzing
the
tall
captain
who
from
having
been
what
we
used
to
term
a
man
all
his
life
had
heard
of
the
but
did
not
know
which
of
the
problems
of
euclid
it
was
nor
how
it
was
applicable
to
navigation
the
fat
captain
therefore
burst
into
a
horse
laugh
saying
i
think
he
hits
you
hard
you
had
better
let
him
alone
he
will
puzzle
you
presently
nettled
at
this
observation
of
his
brother
officer
the
tall
captain
was
put
upon
his
metal
and
insisted
that
the
question
last
proposed
was
not
satisfactorily
answered
and
swore
by
g
that
he
never
would
sign
my
certificate
until
i
did
it
i
persisted
the
two
works
were
compared
i
was
threatened
to
be
turned
back
when
lo
to
the
dismay
of
the
party
the
error
was
found
in
their
own
work
the
fat
captain
who
was
a
man
laughed
heartily
the
other
two
looked
very
silly
and
very
angry
enough
of
this
sir
said
the
martinet
now
stand
up
and
let
us
see
what
you
can
do
with
a
ship
a
ship
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
stocks
she
was
launched
i
was
appointed
to
her
and
as
first
lieutenant
ordered
to
prepare
her
for
sea
i
took
her
into
dock
and
saw
her
coppered
took
her
along
the
masted
her
laid
her
to
the
took
in
and
stowed
her
iron
ballast
and
her
tanks
moved
off
to
a
hulk
or
receiving
ship
rigged
her
completely
bent
her
sails
took
in
guns
stores
and
provisions
reported
her
ready
for
sea
and
made
the
signal
for
a
pilot
took
her
out
of
harbour
and
was
desired
to
conduct
her
into
other
harbours
pointing
out
the
shoals
and
dangers
of
portsmouth
plymouth
falmouth
the
downs
yarmouth
roads
and
even
to
shetland
but
the
little
martinet
and
the
tall
captain
had
not
forgiven
me
for
being
right
in
the
problem
and
my
examination
continued
they
put
my
ship
into
every
possible
situation
which
the
numerous
casualties
of
a
sea
life
present
in
such
endless
variety
i
set
and
took
in
every
sail
from
a
to
i
had
my
masts
shot
away
and
i
rigged
i
made
sail
on
them
and
was
getting
fairly
into
port
when
the
little
martinet
very
cruelly
threw
my
ship
on
her
on
a
dead
a
dark
night
and
blowing
a
hurricane
and
told
me
to
get
her
out
of
that
scrape
if
i
could
i
replied
that
if
there
was
anchorage
i
should
anchor
and
take
my
chance
but
if
there
was
no
anchorage
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
could
save
the
ship
without
a
change
of
wind
or
the
special
interference
of
providence
this
did
not
satisfy
old
chili
vinegar
i
saw
that
i
was
persecuted
and
that
the
end
would
be
fatal
to
my
hopes
i
therefore
became
indifferent
was
fatigued
with
the
endless
questions
put
to
me
and
very
fortunately
for
me
made
a
mistake
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
the
tall
captain
the
question
at
that
time
was
one
which
was
much
controverted
in
the
service
namely
whether
on
being
taken
flat
aback
you
should
put
your
helm
a
turn
or
two
alee
or
keep
it
amidship
i
preferred
the
latter
mode
but
the
tall
captain
insisted
on
the
former
and
gave
his
reasons
finding
myself
on
debatable
ground
i
gave
way
and
thanked
him
for
his
advice
which
i
said
i
should
certainly
follow
whenever
the
case
occurred
to
me
not
that
i
felt
convinced
then
and
have
since
found
that
he
was
wrong
still
my
apparent
tractability
pleased
his
and
he
became
my
advocate
he
grinned
horribly
a
ghastly
smile
and
turning
to
the
other
captains
asked
if
they
were
satisfied
this
question
like
the
blow
of
the
auctioneer
hammer
ends
all
discussion
for
captains
on
these
occasions
never
gainsay
each
other
i
was
told
that
my
passing
certificate
would
be
signed
i
made
my
best
bow
and
my
exit
reflecting
as
i
returned
to
the
sheep
pen
that
i
had
nearly
lost
my
promotion
by
wounding
their
vanity
and
had
regained
my
ground
by
flattering
it
thus
the
world
goes
on
and
from
my
earliest
days
my
mind
was
strengthened
and
confirmed
in
every
vice
by
the
pernicious
example
of
my
superiors
i
might
have
passed
much
more
easily
abroad
i
remember
one
fine
day
at
sea
in
the
west
indies
a
boat
was
lowered
down
and
sent
with
a
young
midshipman
whose
time
was
not
fairly
served
and
whose
age
and
appearance
indicated
anything
but
nautical
knowledge
to
a
ship
then
in
company
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
returned
with
his
passing
certificate
we
were
all
astonished
and
inquired
what
questions
were
put
to
him
he
said
none
at
all
except
as
to
the
health
of
my
father
and
mother
and
whether
i
would
have
port
or
white
wine
and
water
on
coming
away
the
brat
added
one
of
the
captains
desired
i
would
when
i
wrote
home
give
his
best
respects
to
lord
and
lady
he
had
ordered
a
turkey
to
be
picked
and
put
in
the
boat
for
me
and
wished
me
success
this
boy
was
soon
afterwards
made
a
but
fortunately
for
the
service
died
on
his
passage
to
england
there
was
certainly
some
difference
between
this
examination
and
mine
but
when
it
was
over
i
rejoiced
at
the
severity
of
my
ordeal
my
pride
my
darling
pride
was
tickled
at
the
triumph
of
my
talents
and
as
i
wiped
away
the
perspiration
from
my
forehead
i
related
my
difficulties
my
trials
and
my
success
with
a
degree
of
that
in
any
other
person
i
should
have
called
egregious
vanity
one
good
effect
resulted
from
my
long
examination
which
continued
an
hour
and
a
half
this
was
that
the
captains
passed
all
the
other
midshipmen
with
very
few
questions
they
were
tired
of
their
employment
and
thus
it
was
only
the
poor
unlucky
devils
that
took
off
the
fiery
edge
of
their
morning
zeal
who
suffered
and
among
the
plucked
it
was
known
there
were
much
cleverer
fellows
than
many
of
those
who
had
come
off
with
flying
colours
there
was
one
circumstance
which
amused
me
when
the
captains
came
on
deck
the
little
chili
vinegar
called
me
to
him
and
enquired
whether
i
was
any
relation
of
mr
i
replied
that
he
was
my
uncle
bless
my
soul
sir
why
he
is
my
most
intimate
friend
why
did
you
not
tell
me
you
were
his
nephew
i
answered
with
an
affected
humility
very
nearly
allied
to
impertinence
that
i
could
not
see
by
his
face
that
he
knew
my
uncle
nor
indeed
had
i
known
it
should
i
have
thought
it
delicate
to
have
mentioned
it
at
such
a
time
as
it
might
not
only
have
implied
a
want
of
confidence
in
my
own
abilities
but
also
a
suspicion
that
he
might
by
such
a
communication
have
been
induced
to
deviate
from
the
rigid
path
of
his
duty
and
might
therefore
have
received
it
as
a
personal
affront
all
that
is
very
fine
and
very
true
said
the
veteran
but
when
you
have
an
older
head
upon
your
shoulders
and
have
seen
a
little
more
of
our
service
you
will
learn
to
trust
at
least
as
much
to
friends
as
to
merit
and
rely
on
it
that
if
you
could
make
yourself
out
to
the
old
at
the
admiralty
you
would
fare
all
the
better
for
it
however
it
all
over
now
and
there
an
end
of
it
but
make
my
compliments
to
your
uncle
and
tell
him
that
you
passed
your
examination
in
a
manner
highly
creditable
to
you
so
saying
he
touched
his
hat
to
the
serjeant
guard
and
slipped
down
the
side
into
his
gig
as
he
descended
i
said
to
myself
d
n
your
monkey
face
you
little
rascal
no
thanks
to
you
if
i
have
passed
i
suppose
your
father
was
to
the
first
lord
butler
or
else
you
shared
your
mother
milk
with
a
lord
in
waiting
and
that
the
way
you
got
the
command
of
the
elated
with
the
result
of
the
day
i
threw
myself
into
the
mail
that
evening
and
reached
my
father
house
in
a
short
time
after
my
reception
was
kind
and
affectionate
but
death
had
made
sad
havoc
in
my
family
during
my
late
absence
my
elder
brother
and
two
sisters
had
been
successively
called
to
join
my
poor
mother
in
heaven
and
all
that
remained
now
to
comfort
my
father
was
a
younger
sister
and
myself
i
must
confess
that
my
father
received
me
with
great
emotion
his
own
heavy
afflictions
from
the
loss
of
his
children
and
the
dangers
i
had
undergone
as
well
as
the
authentic
assurances
he
had
received
of
my
good
conduct
were
more
than
sufficient
to
bury
all
my
errors
in
oblivion
and
he
appeared
and
i
have
no
doubt
really
was
fonder
and
prouder
of
me
than
ever
as
to
what
my
own
feelings
were
on
this
occasion
i
shall
not
attempt
to
disguise
them
sorry
i
certainly
was
for
the
death
of
my
nearest
relatives
but
when
the
intelligence
reached
me
i
was
in
the
midst
of
the
most
active
service
death
in
all
its
forms
had
become
familiar
to
me
and
so
little
impression
did
the
event
make
on
my
mind
that
i
did
not
interrupt
the
thread
of
my
history
to
speak
of
it
when
it
occurred
i
take
shame
to
myself
for
not
feeling
more
but
i
am
quite
sure
from
this
one
instance
in
my
life
that
the
feelings
are
blunted
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
misery
around
us
that
the
parent
who
in
a
moment
of
peace
and
domestic
tranquillity
would
be
agonized
at
the
loss
of
one
child
would
view
the
death
of
ten
with
comparative
indifference
when
surrounded
by
war
pestilence
or
famine
my
feelings
never
very
acute
in
this
respect
were
completely
blunted
by
my
course
of
life
those
fond
recollections
which
in
a
calm
scene
would
have
wrung
from
me
some
tears
to
their
memory
were
now
drowned
or
absorbed
in
the
waste
the
profligacy
and
the
dissipation
of
war
and
shall
i
add
that
i
easily
reconciled
myself
to
a
loss
which
was
likely
so
much
to
increase
my
worldly
gain
for
my
eldest
brother
i
own
that
even
from
childhood
i
had
felt
a
jealousy
and
dislike
fostered
as
i
think
in
some
measure
unwisely
and
in
part
unavoidably
by
the
conduct
of
my
parents
in
all
matters
of
choice
or
distinction
tom
was
to
have
the
preference
because
he
was
the
oldest
this
i
thought
hard
enough
but
when
tom
had
new
clothes
at
midsummer
and
christmas
and
his
old
ones
were
converted
to
my
use
i
honestly
own
i
wished
the
devil
had
tom
as
a
point
of
economy
perhaps
this
could
not
be
avoided
but
it
engendered
a
hatred
towards
my
brother
which
often
made
me
in
my
own
little
malignant
mind
find
excuses
for
the
conduct
of
cain
tom
was
to
be
sure
what
is
called
a
good
boy
never
soiled
his
clothes
as
i
did
i
was
always
considered
as
a
rantipole
for
whom
any
thing
was
good
enough
but
when
i
saw
my
brother
tricked
out
in
new
clothes
and
his
old
duds
covering
me
like
a
scarecrow
i
appeal
to
any
honourable
mind
whether
it
was
in
human
nature
to
feel
otherwise
than
i
did
without
possessing
an
angelic
disposition
to
which
i
never
pretended
and
i
fairly
own
that
i
did
shed
not
one
fiftieth
part
so
many
tears
over
tom
grave
as
i
did
over
his
dirty
pantaloons
when
forced
to
put
them
on
as
for
my
sisters
i
knew
little
about
them
and
cared
less
we
met
during
the
holidays
and
separated
without
regret
after
a
quarrelling
when
i
went
to
sea
i
ceased
to
think
about
them
concluding
there
was
no
love
lost
but
when
i
found
that
death
had
for
ever
robbed
me
of
two
of
them
i
felt
the
irretrievable
loss
i
reproached
myself
with
my
coldness
and
neglect
and
the
affection
i
had
denied
to
them
i
heaped
threefold
on
my
remaining
sister
even
before
i
had
ever
seen
her
on
my
return
the
tide
of
fraternal
love
flowed
towards
her
with
an
uncontrollable
violence
all
that
i
ought
to
have
felt
towards
the
others
was
concentrated
in
her
and
displayed
itself
with
a
force
which
surprised
even
myself
perhaps
the
reader
may
be
astonished
that
my
first
inquiry
in
london
when
i
had
seen
my
father
and
my
family
should
not
have
been
after
poor
eugenia
whom
i
had
left
and
who
also
had
quitted
me
under
such
very
peculiar
and
interesting
circumstances
i
can
not
however
claim
much
credit
for
having
performed
this
duty
i
did
go
without
loss
of
time
to
her
agent
and
all
that
my
most
urgent
entreaty
could
obtain
from
him
was
that
she
was
well
that
i
still
had
credit
at
his
house
for
any
sum
i
chose
to
draw
for
in
moderation
but
that
her
place
of
abode
must
till
farther
orders
from
her
remain
a
secret
as
my
father
did
not
want
interest
and
my
claims
were
backed
by
good
certificates
i
received
my
commission
as
a
lieutenant
in
his
majesty
navy
about
a
fortnight
after
my
arrival
in
london
but
not
being
appointed
to
any
ship
i
resolved
to
enjoy
the
cum
and
endeavour
to
make
myself
some
amends
for
the
hard
campaign
i
had
so
lately
completed
in
north
america
i
felt
the
transport
of
being
a
something
at
least
i
could
live
independent
of
my
father
let
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
and
i
shall
ever
think
this
step
gave
me
more
real
pleasure
than
either
of
the
two
subsequent
ones
which
i
have
lived
to
attain
no
sooner
therefore
had
i
taken
up
my
commission
than
my
thoughts
turned
on
my
emily
and
two
days
after
the
attainment
of
my
rank
i
mentioned
to
my
father
my
intention
of
paying
a
visit
to
hall
he
was
at
the
time
in
high
good
humour
we
were
sitting
over
our
bottle
of
claret
after
an
excellent
dinner
during
which
i
contributed
very
much
to
his
amusement
by
the
recital
of
some
of
my
late
adventures
he
shuddered
at
my
danger
in
the
hurricane
and
his
sides
had
well
nigh
cracked
with
laughter
when
i
recounted
my
pranks
at
quebec
and
prince
edward
island
when
i
spoke
of
miss
somerville
my
father
said
he
had
no
doubt
she
would
be
happy
to
see
me
that
she
was
now
grown
a
very
beautiful
girl
and
was
the
toast
of
the
county
i
received
this
information
with
an
apparent
cool
indifference
which
i
was
far
from
feeling
inwardly
for
my
heart
beat
at
the
intelligence
perhaps
said
i
picking
my
teeth
and
looking
at
my
mouth
in
a
little
ivory
perhaps
she
may
be
grown
a
fine
girl
she
bade
fair
to
be
so
when
i
saw
her
but
fine
girls
are
very
plenty
since
the
vaccine
has
turned
out
the
besides
the
girls
have
now
another
chance
of
a
good
shape
they
are
allowed
to
take
the
air
instead
of
sitting
all
day
with
their
feet
in
the
stocks
and
their
dear
sweet
noses
bent
over
a
french
grammar
under
the
rod
of
a
french
governess
why
i
took
so
much
pains
to
conceal
from
the
best
of
parents
the
real
state
of
my
heart
i
know
not
except
that
from
habit
deceit
was
to
me
more
readily
at
hand
than
candour
certainly
my
attachment
to
this
fair
and
virtuous
creature
could
not
cause
me
to
blush
except
at
my
own
unworthiness
of
so
much
excellence
my
father
looked
disappointed
i
know
not
why
but
i
afterwards
learned
that
the
subject
of
our
union
had
since
my
brother
death
been
discussed
and
agreed
to
between
him
and
mr
somerville
and
that
our
marriage
was
only
to
be
deferred
until
i
should
have
attained
the
rank
of
captain
provided
always
that
the
parties
were
agreed
i
thought
said
my
father
that
you
were
rather
smitten
in
that
quarter
me
smitten
sir
said
i
with
a
look
of
astonishment
i
have
it
is
true
a
very
high
respect
for
miss
somerville
but
as
for
being
in
love
with
her
i
trust
no
little
attentions
on
my
part
have
been
so
construed
i
have
paid
her
no
more
attention
than
i
may
have
done
to
any
pretty
girl
i
meet
with
this
was
indeed
true
too
true
well
well
said
my
father
it
is
a
mistake
on
my
part
and
here
the
conversation
on
that
subject
was
dropped
it
appeared
that
after
the
little
arrangement
between
mr
somerville
and
my
father
and
when
i
had
gone
to
join
my
ship
in
america
they
had
had
some
communication
together
in
which
mr
somerville
disclosed
that
having
questioned
his
daughter
she
had
ingenuously
confessed
that
i
was
not
indifferent
to
her
she
acknowledged
with
crimson
blushes
that
i
had
requested
and
obtained
a
lock
of
her
hair
this
mr
somerville
told
my
father
in
confidence
he
was
not
therefore
at
liberty
to
mention
it
to
me
but
it
sufficiently
accounts
for
his
astonishment
at
my
seeming
indifference
for
the
two
worthy
parents
had
naturally
concluded
that
it
was
a
match
confounded
and
bewildered
by
my
asseveration
my
father
knew
not
whose
veracity
to
impeach
but
charitably
concluding
there
was
some
mistake
or
that
i
was
as
heretofore
a
fickle
thoughtless
being
considered
himself
bound
in
honour
to
communicate
the
substance
of
our
conversation
to
mr
somerville
and
the
latter
no
sooner
received
it
than
he
placed
the
letter
in
emily
hands
a
very
comfortable
kind
of
for
a
lover
after
an
absence
from
his
mistress
of
full
three
years
i
arrived
at
the
hall
bursting
with
impatience
to
see
the
lovely
girl
whose
hold
on
my
heart
and
affection
was
infinitely
stronger
than
i
had
ever
supposed
darting
from
the
chaise
i
flew
into
the
where
she
usually
passed
her
morning
i
was
now
in
my
year
my
figure
was
decidedly
of
a
handsome
cast
my
face
what
i
knew
most
women
admired
my
personal
advantages
were
heightened
by
the
utmost
attention
to
dress
the
society
of
the
fair
acadians
had
very
much
polished
my
manners
and
i
had
no
more
of
the
professional
roughness
of
the
sea
than
what
like
the
crust
on
the
gave
an
agreeable
flavour
my
countenance
was
as
open
and
as
ingenuous
as
my
heart
was
deceitful
and
desperately
wicked
emily
rose
with
much
agitation
and
in
an
instant
was
clasped
in
my
arms
not
that
the
movement
was
voluntary
on
her
part
it
was
wholly
on
mine
she
rather
recoiled
but
for
an
instant
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
fatal
communication
which
her
father
had
made
to
her
not
two
hours
before
she
allowed
me
perhaps
she
could
not
prevent
it
to
press
her
to
my
heart
she
soon
however
regained
her
presence
of
mind
and
gently
disengaging
herself
gave
vent
to
her
feelings
in
a
violent
flood
of
tears
not
at
the
time
recollecting
the
conversation
with
my
father
much
less
suspecting
that
emily
had
been
made
acquainted
with
it
i
can
not
but
confess
that
this
reception
surprised
me
my
caresses
were
repulsed
as
coming
from
one
totally
disqualified
to
take
such
freedom
she
even
addressed
me
as
mr
mildmay
instead
of
frank
what
may
all
this
mean
my
dearest
emily
said
i
after
so
long
an
absence
what
can
i
have
done
to
make
so
great
an
alteration
in
your
sentiments
is
this
the
reward
of
affection
and
constancy
have
i
so
long
worn
this
dear
emblem
of
your
affection
next
my
heart
in
battle
and
in
tempest
to
be
spurned
from
you
like
a
cur
on
my
return
i
felt
that
i
had
a
clear
right
to
boast
of
constancy
nor
were
the
flirtations
of
halifax
and
quebec
at
all
incompatible
with
such
a
declaration
the
fair
sex
will
start
at
this
proposition
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
emily
was
to
me
what
the
dutchman
best
anchor
was
to
him
he
kept
it
at
home
for
fear
of
losing
it
he
used
other
anchors
in
different
ports
that
answered
the
purpose
tolerably
well
but
this
best
bower
he
always
intended
to
ride
by
in
the
nieu
deep
when
he
had
escaped
all
the
dangers
and
quicksands
of
foreign
shores
such
was
emily
to
me
i
thought
of
her
when
in
the
very
jaws
of
the
shark
i
thought
of
her
when
i
mounted
the
rigging
in
the
hurricane
i
thought
of
her
when
bored
and
tormented
to
madness
by
the
old
passing
captains
all
all
i
might
gain
in
renown
was
for
her
why
then
traitor
like
did
i
deny
her
for
no
other
reason
that
i
can
devise
than
that
endless
love
of
plot
and
deceit
which
had
grown
with
my
growth
madame
de
stael
has
pronounced
love
to
be
an
episode
in
a
man
life
and
so
far
it
is
true
there
are
as
many
episodes
in
life
as
there
are
in
novels
and
romances
but
in
neither
case
do
they
destroy
the
general
plot
of
the
history
although
they
may
for
the
time
distract
or
divert
our
attention
here
then
is
the
distinction
between
passion
and
love
i
felt
a
passion
for
eugenia
love
for
emily
and
why
because
although
it
was
through
my
own
persuasions
and
entreaties
that
her
scruples
had
been
overcome
although
it
was
through
her
affection
for
me
which
would
not
allow
her
to
refuse
me
any
demand
even
to
the
sacrifice
of
herself
that
eugenia
had
fallen
still
in
the
eyes
of
society
she
had
fallen
and
i
did
not
offer
up
a
pure
and
holy
love
to
that
which
was
not
accounted
pure
in
this
i
gave
way
ungratefully
to
the
heartless
casuistry
of
the
world
but
emily
enshrined
in
modesty
with
every
talent
equal
if
not
superior
charms
defended
by
rank
and
connection
was
a
flower
perpetually
blooming
on
the
stem
of
virtue
that
it
would
have
amounted
to
sacrilege
to
attempt
to
have
plucked
and
the
attempt
itself
would
have
savoured
of
insanity
from
the
utter
hopelessness
of
success
every
sentiment
connected
with
her
was
pure
from
mere
selfishness
not
for
worlds
would
i
have
injured
her
because
in
destroying
her
peace
of
mind
my
own
would
have
fled
for
ever
when
i
contemplated
our
final
union
i
blushed
for
my
own
unworthiness
and
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
by
repentance
and
amendment
i
might
be
deemed
worthy
to
lead
her
to
the
altar
i
had
not
time
to
pursue
these
reflections
any
farther
emily
heard
my
appeal
and
rising
from
her
seat
in
the
most
dignified
manner
addressed
me
in
the
commanding
language
of
conscious
virtue
and
injured
innocence
sir
said
she
i
trust
i
am
too
honest
to
deceive
you
or
any
one
nor
have
i
done
that
of
which
i
need
be
ashamed
whatever
reasons
i
may
have
to
repent
of
my
misplaced
confidence
i
will
make
no
secret
of
that
which
now
compels
me
to
change
my
opinion
of
you
you
will
find
them
amply
detailed
in
this
paper
at
the
same
time
putting
into
my
hand
a
letter
from
my
father
to
mr
somerville
in
a
moment
the
mystery
was
unravelled
and
conviction
flashed
in
my
face
like
the
priming
of
a
musket
guilty
and
convicted
on
the
clearest
evidence
i
had
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
throw
myself
on
her
mercy
but
while
i
stood
undecided
and
unknowing
what
to
do
mr
somerville
entered
and
welcomed
me
with
kind
but
cool
hospitality
seeing
emily
in
tears
and
my
father
letter
in
her
hand
he
knew
that
an
had
taken
place
or
was
in
progress
in
this
situation
candour
and
an
honest
confession
that
i
felt
a
in
disclosing
my
passion
to
my
father
would
undoubtedly
have
been
my
safest
course
but
my
right
trusty
friend
the
devil
stepped
in
to
my
assistance
and
suggested
deceit
or
a
continuation
of
that
chain
by
which
he
had
long
since
bound
me
and
not
one
link
of
which
he
took
care
should
ever
be
broken
and
fortunately
for
me
this
plan
answered
at
the
time
better
than
candour
i
must
acknowledge
sir
said
i
that
appearances
are
against
me
i
can
only
trust
to
your
patient
hearing
while
i
state
the
real
facts
allow
me
first
to
say
that
my
father
observations
are
hardly
warranted
by
the
conversation
which
took
place
and
if
you
will
please
in
the
first
place
to
consider
that
that
very
conversation
originated
in
my
expressing
a
wish
and
intention
of
coming
down
to
see
you
and
to
produce
to
your
daughter
the
memento
so
carefully
guarded
during
my
long
absence
you
must
perceive
that
there
is
an
incongruity
in
my
conduct
difficult
to
explain
but
still
through
all
these
mazes
and
windings
i
trust
that
truth
and
constancy
will
be
found
at
the
bottom
you
may
probably
laugh
at
the
idea
but
i
really
felt
jealous
of
my
father
praises
so
lavishly
bestowed
on
miss
somerville
and
not
supposing
he
was
aware
of
my
attachment
i
began
to
fear
he
had
pretensions
of
his
own
he
is
a
widower
healthy
and
not
old
and
it
appeared
to
me
that
he
only
wanted
my
admiration
to
justify
his
choice
of
a
for
myself
and
sister
thus
between
love
for
miss
somerville
and
respect
for
my
father
i
scarcely
knew
how
to
act
that
i
should
for
one
moment
have
felt
jealous
of
my
father
i
now
acknowledge
with
shame
yet
labouring
under
the
erroneous
supposition
of
his
attachment
to
an
object
which
had
been
the
only
one
of
my
adoration
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
a
disclosure
which
i
feared
would
have
renewed
our
differences
and
produced
the
most
insuperable
bars
to
our
future
reconciliation
this
thought
burned
in
my
brain
and
urged
the
speed
of
the
jaded
if
you
will
examine
the
drivers
they
will
tell
you
that
the
whole
way
from
town
they
have
been
stimulated
by
the
rapping
of
a
spanish
dollar
on
the
glass
of
the
chaise
i
dreaded
my
father
getting
the
start
of
me
and
busy
fancy
painted
him
to
my
heated
imagination
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
my
beloved
emily
condemn
me
not
therefore
too
harshly
only
allow
me
the
same
lenient
judgment
which
you
exercised
when
i
first
had
the
pleasure
of
making
your
acquaintance
this
last
sentence
delicately
recalled
the
scene
at
the
inn
and
the
circumstances
of
my
first
introduction
the
defence
was
not
bad
it
wanted
but
one
simple
ingredient
to
have
made
it
excellent
i
mean
truth
but
the
court
being
strongly
biassed
in
favour
of
the
prisoner
i
was
acquitted
and
at
the
same
time
admonished
to
be
more
careful
in
future
the
reconciliation
produced
a
few
more
tears
from
my
beloved
emily
who
soon
after
slipped
out
of
the
room
to
recover
her
flurry
when
mr
somerville
and
myself
were
left
together
he
explained
to
me
the
harmless
plot
which
had
been
laid
for
the
union
between
his
daughter
and
myself
how
true
it
is
that
the
falling
out
of
lovers
is
the
renewal
of
love
the
fair
white
hand
extended
to
me
was
kissed
with
the
more
rapture
as
i
had
feared
the
losing
of
it
for
ever
none
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
a
secure
port
but
he
who
has
been
tempest
tossed
and
in
danger
of
shipwreck
the
dinner
and
the
evening
were
among
the
happiest
i
can
remember
we
sat
but
a
short
time
over
our
wine
as
i
preferred
following
my
mistress
to
the
little
where
tea
and
coffee
were
prepared
and
where
the
musical
instruments
were
kept
emily
sang
and
played
to
me
and
i
sang
and
accompanied
her
and
i
thought
all
the
clocks
and
watches
in
the
house
were
at
least
three
hours
too
fast
when
as
it
struck
twelve
the
signal
was
made
to
retire
i
had
no
sooner
laid
my
head
on
my
pillow
than
i
began
to
call
myself
to
a
severe
account
for
my
duplicity
for
somehow
or
other
i
know
how
it
is
conscience
is
a
very
difficult
sort
of
gentleman
to
deal
with
a
tailor
bill
you
may
avoid
by
crossing
the
channel
but
the
duns
of
conscience
follow
you
to
the
antipodes
and
will
be
satisfied
i
ran
over
the
events
of
the
day
i
reflected
that
i
had
been
on
the
brink
of
losing
my
emily
by
an
act
of
needless
and
unjustifiable
deceit
and
sooner
or
later
i
was
convinced
that
this
part
of
my
character
would
be
made
manifest
and
that
shame
and
punishment
would
overwhelm
me
in
utter
ruin
the
success
which
had
hitherto
attended
me
was
no
against
the
risk
i
ran
of
losing
for
ever
this
lovely
girl
and
the
respect
and
esteem
of
her
father
for
her
sake
therefore
i
made
a
vow
for
ever
to
abandon
this
infernal
system
i
mention
this
more
particularly
as
it
was
the
first
healthy
symptom
of
amendment
i
had
discovered
and
one
to
which
i
long
and
tenaciously
adhered
as
far
at
least
as
my
habits
and
pursuits
in
life
would
allow
me
i
forgot
at
that
time
that
to
be
ingenuous
it
was
necessary
to
be
virtuous
there
is
no
cause
for
concealment
when
we
do
not
act
wrong
a
letter
from
mr
somerville
to
my
father
explained
my
conduct
and
my
father
in
reply
said
i
certainly
must
have
been
mad
to
this
i
assented
quoting
shakspeare
the
lunatic
the
lover
and
the
poet
so
long
as
i
was
out
of
the
scrape
i
cared
little
about
the
impeachment
of
my
rationality
the
days
at
the
hall
flew
just
like
all
the
days
of
happy
lovers
confoundedly
fast
the
more
i
saw
of
emily
the
firmer
and
faster
did
she
rivet
my
chains
i
was
her
slave
but
what
was
best
i
became
a
convert
to
virtue
because
she
was
virtuous
and
to
possess
her
i
knew
i
must
become
as
like
her
as
my
corrupt
mind
and
unruly
habits
would
permit
i
viewed
my
past
life
with
shame
and
contrition
when
i
attended
this
amiable
lovely
creature
to
church
on
a
sunday
and
saw
her
in
the
posture
of
devotion
before
her
maker
i
thought
her
an
angel
and
i
thought
it
heaven
to
be
near
her
all
my
thoughts
and
sentiments
seemed
changed
and
refined
by
her
example
and
her
company
the
sparks
of
religion
so
long
buried
in
the
ashes
of
worldly
corruption
and
infidelity
began
to
revive
i
recalled
my
beloved
mother
and
the
bible
to
my
recollection
and
could
i
have
been
permitted
to
have
remained
longer
with
my
governess
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
should
have
regained
both
purity
of
mind
and
manner
i
should
have
bidden
adieu
to
vice
and
folly
because
they
could
not
have
dwelt
under
the
same
roof
with
emily
and
i
should
have
loved
the
bible
and
religion
because
they
were
beloved
by
her
but
my
untoward
destiny
led
me
a
different
way
chapter
xvi
and
oft
his
smooth
and
bridled
tongue
would
give
the
lie
to
his
flushing
cheek
he
was
a
coward
to
the
strong
he
was
a
tyrant
to
the
weak
shelley
my
father
as
soon
as
he
had
obtained
my
promotion
asked
for
my
being
employed
and
having
had
a
promise
from
the
admiralty
that
promise
unlike
thousands
of
its
predecessors
and
successors
was
too
rapidly
fulfilled
i
received
a
letter
from
my
father
and
a
bouncing
one
from
the
admiralty
by
the
same
post
announcing
officially
my
appointment
to
the
d
brig
of
eighteen
guns
at
portsmouth
whither
i
was
directed
to
repair
immediately
and
take
up
my
commission
in
this
transaction
i
soon
after
found
there
was
an
underplot
which
i
was
too
green
to
perceive
at
the
time
but
the
wise
heads
of
the
two
papas
had
agreed
that
a
separation
between
the
lovers
was
absolutely
necessary
and
that
the
longer
it
was
delayed
the
worse
it
would
be
for
both
of
us
in
short
that
until
i
had
attained
my
rank
nothing
should
be
thought
of
in
the
way
of
matrimony
as
the
reader
is
no
doubt
by
this
time
pretty
well
versed
in
all
the
dialogue
of
parting
lovers
i
shall
not
intrude
upon
his
or
her
patience
with
a
repetition
of
that
which
has
been
much
too
often
repeated
and
is
equally
familiar
to
the
prince
and
the
ploughman
i
should
as
soon
think
of
describing
the
devil
punch
bowl
on
the
road
to
portsmouth
where
i
arrived
two
days
after
my
appointment
i
put
up
at
billett
at
the
george
as
a
matter
of
course
because
it
was
the
resort
of
all
the
naval
aristocracy
and
directly
opposite
to
the
admiral
office
the
first
person
for
whom
i
made
my
kind
inquiries
was
my
captain
elect
but
he
herded
not
with
his
brother
epaulettes
he
did
not
live
at
the
george
nor
did
he
mess
at
the
crown
he
was
not
at
the
fountain
nor
the
parade
and
the
blue
posts
ignored
him
but
he
was
to
be
heard
of
at
the
star
and
garter
on
the
tip
of
portsmouth
point
he
did
not
even
live
there
but
generally
resided
on
board
this
does
not
savour
well
i
never
like
your
captains
who
live
on
board
their
ships
in
harbour
no
ship
can
be
comfortable
for
no
one
can
do
as
he
pleases
which
is
the
life
and
soul
of
a
when
in
port
to
the
star
and
garter
i
went
and
asked
for
captain
i
hoped
i
should
not
find
him
here
for
this
house
had
been
time
out
of
mind
the
rendezvous
of
mates
and
midshipmen
here
however
he
was
i
sent
up
my
card
and
was
admitted
to
his
presence
he
was
seated
in
a
small
parlour
with
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
or
at
least
the
remains
of
it
before
him
his
feet
were
on
the
fender
and
several
official
documents
which
he
had
received
that
morning
were
lying
on
the
table
he
rose
as
i
entered
and
shewed
me
a
short
frame
with
a
strong
projection
of
the
sphere
or
what
the
spaniards
call
this
rotundity
of
corporation
was
however
supported
by
as
fine
a
pair
of
atlas
legs
as
ever
were
worn
by
a
bath
chairman
his
face
was
rather
inclined
to
be
handsome
the
features
regular
a
pleasant
smile
upon
his
lips
and
a
deep
dimple
in
his
chin
but
his
most
remarkable
feature
was
his
eye
it
was
small
but
piercing
and
seemed
to
possess
that
of
the
perpetual
motion
since
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
fix
it
for
one
moment
on
any
object
and
there
was
in
it
a
lurking
expression
which
though
something
of
a
physiognomist
i
could
not
readily
decipher
mr
mildmay
said
my
skipper
i
am
extremely
happy
to
see
you
and
still
more
so
that
you
have
been
appointed
to
my
ship
will
you
be
seated
as
i
obeyed
he
turned
round
and
rubbing
his
hands
as
if
he
had
just
laid
down
his
soap
he
continued
i
always
make
it
a
rule
previous
to
an
officer
joining
my
ship
to
learn
something
of
his
character
from
my
brother
captains
it
is
a
precaution
which
i
take
as
i
consider
that
one
scabby
sheep
is
strictly
applicable
to
our
service
i
wish
to
have
good
officers
and
perfect
gentlemen
about
me
there
are
no
doubt
many
officers
who
can
do
their
duty
well
and
with
whom
i
should
have
no
fault
to
find
but
then
there
is
a
way
of
doing
it
a
in
which
a
gentleman
only
can
attain
to
coarse
manners
execrations
and
abusive
language
render
the
men
discontented
degrade
the
service
and
are
therefore
very
properly
forbidden
in
the
second
article
of
war
under
such
officers
the
men
always
work
unwillingly
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
make
some
inquiries
about
you
and
can
only
say
that
all
i
have
heard
is
to
your
advantage
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
suit
each
other
and
be
assured
it
shall
be
my
study
to
make
you
as
comfortable
as
possible
to
this
very
sensible
and
polite
address
i
made
a
suitable
reply
he
then
stated
that
he
expected
to
sail
in
a
few
days
that
the
officer
whom
i
was
to
supersede
had
not
exactly
suited
his
ideas
although
he
believed
him
to
be
a
very
worthy
young
man
and
that
in
consequence
he
had
applied
and
succeeded
in
obtaining
for
him
another
appointment
that
it
was
necessary
he
should
join
his
ship
immediately
but
of
course
he
must
first
be
superseded
by
me
therefore
said
he
you
had
better
meet
me
on
board
the
brig
morning
at
nine
when
your
commission
shall
be
read
and
after
that
i
beg
you
will
consider
yourself
your
own
master
for
a
few
days
as
i
presume
you
have
some
little
arrangements
to
prepare
for
your
cruise
i
am
aware
pursued
he
smiling
most
benignantly
that
there
are
many
little
comforts
which
officers
wish
to
attend
to
such
as
fitting
their
cabins
and
looking
to
their
mess
and
a
thousand
other
nameless
things
which
tend
to
pass
the
time
and
break
up
the
monotony
of
a
forty
years
have
i
trod
the
king
planks
man
and
boy
and
not
with
any
great
success
as
you
may
perceive
by
the
rank
i
now
hold
and
the
life
i
am
leading
for
here
i
sit
over
a
glass
of
humble
grog
instead
of
joining
my
brother
captains
in
their
claret
at
the
crown
but
i
have
two
sisters
to
support
and
i
feel
more
satisfaction
in
doing
my
duty
as
a
brother
than
indulging
my
appetite
although
i
own
i
have
no
dislike
to
a
glass
of
claret
when
it
does
not
come
before
me
in
a
questionable
shape
i
mean
when
i
have
not
got
to
pay
for
it
which
i
can
not
afford
now
do
not
let
me
take
up
any
more
of
your
time
you
have
plenty
of
acquaintances
that
you
wish
to
see
i
have
no
doubt
and
as
for
my
yarns
they
will
do
to
pass
away
a
watch
when
we
have
nothing
more
attractive
to
divert
us
so
saying
he
held
out
his
hand
and
shook
mine
most
cordially
at
nine
he
repeated
and
i
left
him
much
pleased
with
my
interview
i
went
back
to
my
inn
thinking
what
a
very
fortunate
fellow
i
was
to
have
such
an
honest
bold
british
hero
of
a
captain
on
my
first
appointment
i
ordered
my
dinner
at
the
george
and
then
strolled
out
to
make
my
purchases
and
give
my
orders
for
a
few
articles
for
sea
service
i
fell
in
with
several
old
messmates
they
congratulated
me
on
my
promotion
and
declared
i
should
give
them
a
dinner
to
wet
my
commission
to
which
i
readily
consented
the
day
was
named
and
mr
billett
was
ordered
to
provide
accordingly
having
dined
i
amused
myself
in
writing
a
long
letter
to
my
dear
emily
and
with
the
assistance
of
a
bottle
of
wine
succeeded
in
composing
a
tolerably
warm
and
rapturous
sort
of
a
document
which
i
sealed
kissed
and
sent
to
the
after
which
i
built
castles
till
bed
time
but
not
one
castle
did
i
build
in
which
emily
was
not
the
sole
mistress
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
and
the
next
morning
by
seven
i
was
arrayed
in
a
new
uniform
with
an
immensely
large
epaulette
stuck
on
my
right
shoulder
having
breakfasted
i
sallied
out
and
in
my
own
conceit
was
as
handsome
a
chap
as
ever
buckled
a
sword
belt
i
skimmed
with
a
light
and
vigorous
foot
down
boat
your
honour
said
a
dozen
voices
at
once
as
i
reached
new
sallyport
but
i
was
resolved
that
should
have
a
look
at
me
as
well
as
so
i
kept
a
profound
and
mysterious
silence
and
let
the
watermen
follow
me
to
point
just
like
so
many
sucking
fish
after
a
shark
i
had
two
or
three
offers
for
volunteers
to
serve
with
me
as
i
went
along
but
they
were
not
of
the
right
sex
so
i
did
not
take
them
boat
to
spithead
your
honour
said
a
tough
old
waterman
ay
you
do
said
i
so
i
jumped
into
his
wherry
and
we
shoved
off
what
ship
is
your
honour
going
to
said
the
man
to
the
d
brig
oh
you
are
to
she
are
you
to
belong
to
her
mayhap
yes
i
replied
the
waterman
gave
a
sigh
feathered
his
oar
and
never
spoke
another
word
till
we
came
alongside
i
did
not
regret
his
taciturnity
for
i
was
always
more
amused
with
my
own
thoughts
than
in
conversing
with
illiterate
people
the
brig
was
a
most
beautiful
vessel
she
mounted
eighteen
guns
and
sat
on
the
water
like
a
duck
i
perceived
that
the
pendant
was
up
for
punishment
and
this
i
thought
rather
an
unusual
sight
at
spithead
i
took
it
for
granted
that
some
aggravated
offence
such
as
theft
or
mutiny
had
been
committed
seeing
i
was
an
officer
i
was
admitted
alongside
so
i
paid
the
waterman
and
sent
him
away
as
i
went
up
the
side
i
saw
a
poor
fellow
up
to
the
grating
according
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
natives
while
the
captain
officers
and
ship
company
stood
round
witnessing
the
athletic
dexterity
of
a
boatswain
mate
who
by
the
even
deep
and
parallel
marks
of
the
cat
on
the
white
back
and
shoulders
of
the
patient
seemed
to
be
perfectly
master
of
his
business
all
this
did
not
surprise
me
i
was
used
to
it
but
after
the
address
of
my
captain
on
the
preceding
day
i
was
very
much
surprised
to
hear
language
in
direct
violation
of
the
second
article
of
war
cursings
and
execrations
poured
out
of
his
mouth
with
a
volubility
equal
to
any
the
most
accomplished
lady
on
the
back
of
the
point
boatswain
mate
roared
the
captain
do
your
duty
or
by
g
i
will
have
up
and
give
you
four
dozen
yourself
one
would
think
d
n
your
b
d
that
you
were
brushing
flies
off
a
sleeping
venus
instead
of
punishing
a
scoundrel
with
a
hide
as
thick
as
a
buffalo
and
be
d
d
to
him
do
your
duty
sir
d
n
your
soul
during
this
elegant
address
the
unhappy
wretch
had
received
four
severe
dozen
which
the
had
counted
aloud
and
reported
to
the
captain
another
boatswain
mate
said
he
the
poor
creature
turned
his
head
over
his
shoulders
with
an
imploring
look
but
it
was
in
vain
i
watched
the
countenance
of
the
captain
and
the
peculiar
expression
which
i
could
not
decipher
at
my
first
interview
i
now
read
most
plainly
it
was
malignant
cruelty
and
delight
in
torturing
his
own
species
he
seemed
to
take
a
diabolical
pleasure
in
the
hateful
operation
which
we
were
compelled
to
witness
the
second
boatswain
mate
commenced
with
a
fresh
cat
and
gave
a
lash
across
the
back
of
the
prisoner
that
made
start
one
said
the
beginning
to
count
one
roared
the
captain
do
you
call
that
one
not
a
quarter
of
a
one
that
fellow
is
only
fit
for
at
a
pork
shop
disrate
you
by
g
d
you
d
d
molly
mop
is
that
the
way
you
handle
a
cat
that
only
wiping
the
dirt
off
his
back
where
the
boatswain
here
said
a
stout
gigantic
fellow
stepping
forward
with
a
huge
blue
uniform
coat
and
a
plain
anchor
button
holding
his
hat
in
his
left
hand
and
stroking
his
hair
down
his
forehead
with
his
right
i
surveyed
this
man
as
he
turned
himself
about
and
concluded
that
the
tailor
who
worked
for
him
had
been
threatened
with
a
specimen
of
his
art
if
he
stinted
him
in
cloth
for
the
skirts
of
his
coat
were
ample
terminating
in
an
inclined
plane
the
corners
in
front
being
much
lower
than
the
middle
of
the
robe
behind
the
buttons
on
the
hips
were
nearly
pistol
shot
asunder
give
this
man
a
dozen
sir
said
captain
and
if
you
favour
him
i
put
you
under
arrest
and
stop
your
liquor
this
last
part
of
the
threat
had
more
effect
with
mr
pipe
than
the
first
he
began
to
peel
as
the
boxers
call
it
off
came
his
capacious
coat
a
red
waistcoat
for
a
smithfield
ox
was
next
deposited
then
he
untied
a
black
silk
handkerchief
and
showed
a
throat
covered
like
that
of
a
goat
with
long
brown
hairs
thick
as
he
next
rolled
up
his
above
his
elbow
and
showed
an
arm
and
a
back
very
like
the
farnese
hercules
which
no
doubt
all
my
readers
have
seen
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
at
when
they
have
been
to
the
exhibition
this
hopeful
commentator
on
articles
of
war
seized
his
cat
the
handle
was
two
feet
long
one
inch
and
three
quarters
thick
and
covered
with
red
baize
the
tails
of
this
terrific
weapon
were
three
feet
long
nine
in
number
and
each
of
them
about
the
size
of
that
line
which
covers
the
springs
of
a
travelling
carriage
mr
pipes
whose
scientific
display
in
this
part
of
his
art
had
no
doubt
procured
for
him
the
warrant
of
a
boatswain
in
virtue
of
which
he
now
stood
as
the
vindicator
of
the
laws
of
his
country
handled
his
cat
like
an
adept
looked
at
it
from
top
to
bottom
cleared
all
the
tails
by
the
insertion
of
his
delicate
fingers
and
combing
them
out
stretched
out
his
left
leg
for
he
was
as
well
as
and
measuring
his
distance
with
the
accurate
eye
of
an
engineer
raised
his
cat
high
in
air
with
his
left
hand
his
right
still
holding
the
tips
of
the
tails
as
if
to
restrain
their
impatience
when
giving
his
arm
and
body
a
full
swing
embracing
of
the
circle
he
inflicted
a
tremendous
stroke
on
the
back
of
the
unfortunate
culprit
this
specimen
seemed
to
satisfy
the
amateur
captain
who
nodded
approbation
to
the
inquiring
look
of
the
amateur
boatswain
the
poor
man
lost
his
respiration
from
the
force
of
the
blow
and
the
tails
of
the
cat
coming
from
an
opposite
direction
to
the
first
four
dozen
cut
the
flesh
bringing
the
blood
at
every
blow
i
will
not
wound
the
feelings
of
my
readers
with
a
description
of
the
poor
wretch
situation
even
at
this
distance
of
time
i
am
shocked
at
it
and
bitterly
lament
the
painful
necessity
i
have
often
been
under
of
inflicting
similar
punishment
but
i
hope
and
trust
i
never
did
it
without
a
cause
or
in
the
wanton
display
of
arbitrary
power
the
last
dozen
being
finished
the
sum
total
was
reported
by
the
five
dozen
five
dozen
repeated
captain
g
that
will
do
cast
him
off
and
now
sir
said
he
to
the
fainting
wretch
i
hope
this
will
be
a
warning
to
you
that
the
next
time
you
wish
to
empty
your
beastly
mouth
you
will
not
spit
on
my
heavens
thought
i
is
all
this
for
spitting
on
the
and
this
from
the
moralist
of
yesterday
who
allowed
neither
oaths
nor
execrations
and
has
uttered
more
blasphemy
in
the
last
ten
minutes
than
i
have
heard
for
the
last
ten
weeks
i
had
not
yet
caught
the
captain
eye
he
was
too
intent
on
his
amusement
as
soon
as
the
prisoner
was
cast
loose
he
commanded
to
pipe
down
or
in
other
words
to
dismiss
the
people
to
their
usual
occupations
when
i
went
up
to
him
and
touched
my
hat
oh
you
are
come
are
you
pipe
belay
there
send
every
body
aft
on
the
my
commission
was
then
read
all
hats
off
in
respect
to
the
sovereign
from
whom
the
authority
was
derived
after
this
i
being
duly
inaugurated
became
the
second
lieutenant
of
the
sloop
and
the
captain
without
condescending
to
give
me
another
word
or
look
ordered
his
gig
to
be
manned
and
was
going
on
shore
i
was
not
presented
by
him
to
any
of
the
officers
which
in
common
courtesy
he
ought
to
have
done
this
omission
however
was
supplied
by
the
first
lieutenant
who
invited
me
down
into
the
to
introduce
me
to
my
new
messmates
we
left
the
tiger
pacing
up
and
down
on
his
the
first
lieutenant
was
of
the
medium
stature
a
suitable
height
for
a
sloop
of
war
a
spare
figure
of
about
forty
years
of
age
he
had
but
one
eye
and
that
eye
was
as
odd
a
one
as
the
captain
there
was
in
it
however
unlike
the
captain
an
infinite
deal
of
humour
and
when
he
cocked
it
as
he
constantly
did
it
almost
spoke
i
never
saw
three
such
eyes
in
two
such
heads
there
was
a
lurking
smile
in
the
lieutenant
face
when
i
told
him
that
the
captain
had
desired
me
to
come
on
board
and
read
my
commission
after
which
i
might
have
two
or
three
days
to
myself
to
prepare
for
sea
well
said
he
you
had
better
go
and
ask
him
now
but
you
will
find
him
a
rum
one
accordingly
up
i
went
to
him
have
you
any
objection
to
my
going
on
shore
sir
shore
sir
bellowed
he
and
who
the
devil
is
to
carry
on
the
duty
if
you
go
on
shore
shore
eh
i
wish
there
was
no
shore
and
then
d
n
the
dog
that
could
swim
no
sir
you
have
had
shore
enough
the
service
is
going
to
h
l
sir
a
parcel
of
brats
with
lieutenants
commissions
before
they
should
have
been
clear
of
the
nursery
no
sir
stay
on
board
or
d
n
me
i
break
you
like
an
before
you
have
taken
the
shine
out
of
that
fine
new
epaulette
no
no
by
g
no
more
cats
here
than
catch
mice
you
stay
on
board
and
do
your
duty
every
man
does
his
duty
here
and
let
me
see
the
that
do
do
it
i
was
in
some
measure
prepared
for
this
sublime
harangue
but
still
there
was
sufficient
room
in
my
mind
to
admit
of
great
astonishment
at
this
sudden
change
of
wind
i
replied
that
he
had
promised
me
leave
yesterday
and
that
upon
the
strength
of
that
promise
i
had
left
all
my
things
on
shore
and
that
i
was
not
in
any
way
prepared
to
go
to
sea
i
promised
you
leave
did
i
perhaps
i
did
but
that
was
only
to
get
you
on
board
i
am
up
to
your
tricks
you
d
d
young
chaps
when
you
get
on
shore
there
is
no
getting
you
off
again
no
no
you
would
not
have
made
your
appearance
these
three
days
if
i
had
sugared
the
trap
now
i
have
got
you
i
keep
you
d
n
my
eyes
i
repeated
my
request
to
go
on
shore
but
without
condescending
to
offer
any
farther
reasons
he
answered
i
see
you
d
d
first
sir
and
observe
i
never
admit
of
expostulation
nothing
affords
me
more
pleasure
than
to
oblige
my
officers
in
every
thing
reasonable
but
i
never
permit
reply
thought
i
to
myself
you
certainly
have
escaped
from
hell
and
i
do
not
see
how
the
infernal
regions
can
do
without
you
you
would
have
been
one
of
the
most
ingenious
tormentors
of
the
damned
domitian
would
have
made
you
admiral
and
your
boatswain
captain
of
the
fleet
having
made
this
reflection
as
i
took
a
turn
or
two
on
deck
thinking
what
was
best
to
be
done
and
knowing
that
the
king
could
do
no
wrong
the
officer
whom
i
had
just
superseded
came
up
the
hatchway
and
touching
his
hat
very
respectfully
to
the
captain
asked
whether
he
might
go
on
shore
you
may
go
to
hell
and
be
d
d
sir
said
the
captain
who
hated
bad
language
you
are
not
fit
to
carry
guts
to
a
bear
you
are
not
worth
your
salt
and
the
sooner
you
are
off
the
cleaner
the
ship
will
be
do
stand
staring
at
me
like
a
bull
over
a
gate
down
and
pack
up
your
traps
or
i
freshen
your
way
raising
his
foot
at
the
same
time
as
if
he
was
going
to
kick
him
the
young
officer
who
was
a
mild
gentlemanly
and
courageous
youth
did
as
he
was
bidden
i
was
perfectly
astonished
i
had
been
accustomed
to
sail
with
gentlemen
i
had
heard
of
martinets
and
disciplinarians
and
captains
but
this
outdid
all
i
ever
could
have
conceived
and
much
more
than
i
thought
ever
could
have
been
submitted
to
by
any
correct
officer
roused
to
indignation
and
determined
not
to
be
treated
in
this
manner
i
again
walked
up
to
him
and
requested
leave
to
go
on
shore
you
have
had
your
answer
sir
yes
i
have
sir
said
i
and
in
language
that
i
never
before
heard
on
his
majesty
i
joined
this
ship
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
and
as
such
i
will
be
treated
mutiny
by
g
roared
the
captain
with
your
new
commission
before
the
ink
is
dry
as
you
please
sir
i
replied
but
i
shall
write
a
letter
to
the
stating
the
circumstances
and
requesting
leave
of
absence
and
that
letter
i
shall
trouble
you
to
forward
i
be
d
d
if
i
do
said
he
then
sir
said
i
as
you
have
refused
to
forward
it
and
in
the
presence
of
all
the
officers
and
ship
company
i
shall
forward
it
without
troubling
you
this
last
shot
of
mine
seemed
to
produce
the
same
effect
upon
him
that
the
last
round
does
upon
a
beaten
boxer
he
did
not
come
to
time
but
muttering
something
dived
down
the
companion
and
went
into
his
cabin
the
first
lieutenant
now
came
up
and
congratulated
me
on
my
victory
you
have
puzzled
and
muzzled
the
bear
completely
said
he
i
have
long
wanted
a
coadjutor
like
yourself
wilson
who
is
going
to
leave
us
is
the
best
creature
that
ever
lived
but
though
brave
as
a
lion
before
an
enemy
he
is
cowed
by
this
incarnate
devil
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
message
from
the
captain
who
desired
to
speak
with
me
in
his
cabin
i
went
down
he
received
me
with
the
benignant
smile
of
our
first
acquaintance
mr
mildmay
said
he
i
always
assume
a
little
tartness
with
my
officers
when
they
first
join
and
when
they
quit
you
too
thought
i
not
only
to
prove
to
them
that
i
am
and
will
be
the
captain
of
my
own
ship
but
also
as
an
example
to
the
men
who
when
they
see
what
the
officers
are
forced
to
put
up
with
feel
themselves
more
contented
with
their
lot
and
obey
more
readily
but
as
i
told
you
before
the
comfort
of
my
officers
is
my
constant
study
you
are
welcome
to
go
ashore
and
have
hours
leave
to
collect
your
necessaries
to
this
harangue
i
made
no
reply
but
touching
my
hat
quitted
the
cabin
i
felt
so
much
contempt
for
the
man
that
i
was
afraid
to
speak
lest
i
should
commit
myself
the
captain
shortly
after
quitted
the
ship
telling
the
first
lieutenant
that
i
had
permission
to
go
on
shore
i
was
now
left
at
liberty
to
make
acquaintance
with
my
companions
in
misery
and
nothing
conduces
to
intimacy
so
much
as
community
of
suffering
my
resistance
to
the
brutality
of
our
common
taskmaster
had
pleased
them
they
told
me
what
a
tyrant
and
what
a
disgrace
to
the
service
he
was
and
how
shameful
it
was
that
he
should
be
entrusted
with
the
command
of
so
fine
a
vessel
or
of
any
vessel
at
all
except
it
were
a
convict
ship
the
stories
they
told
me
of
him
were
almost
incredible
and
nothing
but
the
too
well
founded
idea
that
an
officer
trying
his
captain
by
a
had
a
black
mark
against
him
for
ever
after
and
was
never
known
to
rise
could
have
saved
this
man
from
the
punishment
he
so
richly
deserved
no
officer
they
said
had
been
more
than
three
weeks
in
the
ship
and
they
were
all
making
interest
to
leave
her
in
my
report
of
what
occurred
in
this
vessel
during
the
time
i
belonged
to
her
i
must
in
justice
to
the
captains
and
commanders
of
his
majesty
navy
observe
that
the
case
was
unique
of
its
kind
such
a
character
as
captain
g
was
rarely
met
with
in
the
navy
then
and
for
reasons
which
i
shall
give
will
be
still
more
rare
in
future
the
first
lieutenant
told
me
that
i
had
acted
very
judiciously
in
resisting
at
first
his
undue
exertion
of
authority
that
he
was
at
once
a
tyrant
a
bully
and
a
coward
and
would
be
careful
how
he
attacked
me
again
but
be
on
your
guard
said
he
he
will
never
forgive
you
and
when
he
is
most
agreeable
there
is
the
most
mischief
to
be
dreaded
he
will
lull
you
into
security
and
whenever
he
can
catch
you
tripping
he
will
try
you
by
a
you
had
better
go
on
shore
and
settle
all
your
business
and
if
possible
be
on
board
before
your
leave
is
out
it
was
only
your
threat
of
writing
to
the
that
procured
you
leave
of
absence
you
have
nothing
to
thank
him
for
he
would
have
kept
you
on
board
if
he
dared
i
have
never
quitted
the
ship
since
i
joined
her
and
never
has
a
day
passed
without
a
scene
similar
to
what
you
have
this
morning
witnessed
and
yet
continued
he
if
it
were
not
for
his
cruelty
to
the
men
he
is
the
most
amusing
liar
i
ever
heard
i
am
often
more
inclined
to
laugh
than
to
be
angry
at
him
he
has
a
vein
of
wit
and
rich
humour
that
runs
through
his
composition
and
never
quits
him
there
is
drollery
even
in
his
malice
and
if
we
can
not
get
clear
of
him
we
must
make
the
best
of
him
i
went
on
shore
collected
all
my
clothes
and
the
other
articles
of
which
i
stood
in
need
and
was
on
board
my
ship
again
the
next
morning
before
eight
chapter
xvii
he
will
lie
sir
with
such
volubility
that
you
would
think
truth
were
a
fool
drunkenness
is
his
best
virtue
for
he
will
be
and
in
his
sleep
he
does
little
shakspeare
when
captain
g
made
his
appearance
he
seemed
to
be
in
the
most
amiable
humour
possible
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
said
ah
this
is
what
i
like
never
break
your
leave
even
for
five
minutes
now
that
i
see
i
can
trust
you
you
may
go
on
shore
again
as
soon
as
you
please
this
speech
might
have
done
very
well
to
any
person
before
the
mast
but
as
applied
to
an
officer
i
thought
it
rude
and
ungentlemanly
the
caterer
had
prepared
lunch
in
the
it
consisted
of
and
broiled
bullocks
kidneys
with
fried
onions
and
their
savoury
smell
rose
in
grateful
steams
up
the
skylight
and
assailed
the
nostrils
of
the
skipper
his
facetious
knew
no
bounds
he
leaned
over
the
frame
and
looking
down
said
i
say
something
devilish
good
going
on
there
below
the
hint
was
taken
and
the
first
lieutenant
invited
him
down
i
do
care
if
i
do
i
am
rather
peckish
so
saying
he
was
down
the
hatchway
in
the
twinkling
of
one
of
his
own
funny
eyes
as
he
feared
the
choice
bits
would
be
gone
before
he
could
get
into
action
we
all
followed
him
and
as
he
seated
himself
he
said
i
trust
gentlemen
this
is
not
the
last
time
i
shall
sit
in
the
and
that
you
will
all
consider
my
cabin
as
your
own
i
love
to
make
my
officers
comfortable
nothing
more
delightful
than
a
harmonious
ship
where
every
man
and
boy
is
ready
to
go
to
h
l
for
his
officers
that
what
i
call
good
fellowship
give
and
take
make
proper
allowances
for
one
another
failings
and
we
shall
be
sorry
when
the
time
comes
for
us
to
part
i
am
afraid
however
that
i
shall
not
be
long
with
you
for
though
i
doat
upon
the
brig
the
duke
of
n
and
lord
george
have
given
the
first
lord
a
d
d
for
not
promoting
me
sooner
and
between
ourselves
i
do
wish
to
go
farther
my
post
commission
goes
out
with
me
to
barbadoes
the
first
lieutenant
cocked
his
eye
and
quick
as
were
the
motions
of
that
eye
the
captain
with
a
twist
of
one
of
his
own
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
before
it
could
be
returned
to
its
bearing
on
the
central
object
the
kidneys
and
onions
but
it
passed
off
without
remark
a
very
capital
steak
this
i
trouble
you
for
some
fat
and
a
little
gravy
we
have
some
jollification
when
we
get
to
sea
but
we
must
get
into
blue
water
first
then
we
shall
have
less
to
do
talking
of
broiling
steaks
when
i
was
in
egypt
we
used
to
broil
our
on
the
rocks
no
occasion
for
fire
thermometer
at
hot
as
h
l
i
have
seen
four
thousand
men
at
a
time
cooking
for
the
whole
army
as
much
as
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
pounds
of
steaks
at
a
time
all
hissing
and
frying
at
a
time
just
about
noon
of
course
you
know
not
a
spark
of
fire
some
of
the
soldiers
who
had
been
brought
up
as
at
leith
swore
they
never
saw
such
heat
i
used
to
go
to
leeward
of
them
for
a
whiff
and
think
of
old
england
ah
that
the
country
after
all
where
a
man
may
think
and
say
what
he
pleases
but
that
sort
of
work
did
not
last
long
as
you
may
suppose
their
eyes
were
all
fried
out
d
n
me
in
three
or
four
weeks
i
had
been
ill
in
my
bed
for
i
was
attached
to
the
regiment
seventeen
hundred
strong
i
had
a
party
of
seamen
with
me
but
the
ophthalmia
made
such
ravages
that
the
whole
regiment
colonel
and
all
went
stone
blind
all
except
one
corporal
you
may
stare
gentlemen
but
it
very
true
well
this
corporal
had
a
precious
time
of
it
he
was
obliged
to
lead
out
the
whole
regiment
to
water
he
led
the
way
and
two
or
three
took
hold
of
the
skirts
of
his
jacket
on
each
side
the
skirts
of
these
were
seized
again
by
as
many
more
and
double
the
number
to
the
last
and
so
all
held
on
by
one
another
till
they
had
all
had
a
drink
at
the
well
and
as
the
devil
would
have
it
there
was
but
one
well
among
us
all
so
this
corporal
used
to
water
the
regiment
just
as
a
groom
waters
his
horses
and
all
spreading
out
you
know
just
like
the
tail
of
a
peacock
of
which
the
corporal
was
the
rump
interrupted
the
doctor
the
captain
looked
grave
you
found
it
warm
in
that
country
inquired
the
surgeon
warm
exclaimed
the
captain
i
tell
you
what
doctor
when
you
go
where
you
have
sent
many
a
patient
and
where
for
that
very
reason
you
certainly
will
go
i
only
hope
for
your
sake
and
for
that
of
your
profession
in
general
that
you
will
not
find
it
quite
so
hot
as
we
found
it
in
egypt
what
do
you
think
of
nineteen
of
my
men
being
killed
by
the
concentrated
rays
of
light
falling
on
the
barrels
of
the
sentinels
bright
muskets
and
setting
fire
to
the
powder
i
commanded
a
mortar
battery
at
acre
and
i
did
the
french
infernal
mischief
with
the
shells
i
used
to
pitch
in
among
them
when
they
had
sat
down
to
dinner
but
how
do
you
think
the
scoundrels
weathered
on
me
at
last
d
n
me
they
trained
a
parcel
of
poodle
dogs
to
watch
the
shells
when
they
fell
and
then
to
run
and
pull
the
fuses
out
with
their
teeth
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
d
d
villains
by
this
means
they
saved
hundreds
of
men
and
only
lost
half
a
dozen
dogs
fact
by
g
only
ask
sir
sydney
smith
he
tell
you
the
same
and
a
d
d
sight
more
the
volubility
of
his
tongue
was
only
equalled
by
the
rapidity
of
his
invention
and
the
powers
of
mastication
for
during
the
whole
of
this
entertaining
monodrame
his
teeth
were
in
constant
motion
like
the
traversing
beam
of
a
steam
boat
and
as
he
was
our
captain
as
well
as
our
guest
he
certainly
took
the
lion
share
of
the
repast
but
i
say
soundings
said
he
addressing
himself
familiarly
to
the
master
who
had
not
been
long
in
the
vessel
let
us
see
what
sort
of
stuff
you
have
stowed
the
with
you
know
i
am
a
water
drinker
give
me
only
the
pure
limpid
stream
and
a
child
may
lead
me
i
seldom
touch
liquor
when
the
water
is
good
so
saying
he
poured
out
a
tumbler
and
held
it
to
his
nose
stinks
like
h
i
say
master
are
you
sure
the
bungs
are
in
your
casks
the
cats
have
been
contributing
to
the
fluid
we
must
qualify
this
and
having
poured
of
the
water
which
by
the
by
was
very
good
he
supplied
the
vacancy
with
rum
then
tasting
it
he
said
come
miss
puss
this
will
rouse
you
out
at
any
rate
a
moment
pause
while
he
held
the
bumper
before
his
eye
and
then
down
it
went
producing
no
other
emotion
than
a
deep
sigh
by
the
by
that
well
thought
of
we
have
no
cats
in
the
ship
except
those
which
the
depravity
of
human
nature
unhappily
compels
the
boatswain
to
use
mr
skysail
you
look
to
that
throw
them
all
overboard
taking
his
hat
he
rose
from
the
table
and
mounting
the
ladder
on
second
thought
said
he
addressing
skysail
again
i
wo
throw
the
cats
overboard
the
sailors
have
a
foolish
superstition
about
that
animal
its
d
d
unlucky
no
put
them
alive
in
a
and
send
them
on
shore
in
the
recollecting
that
my
dinner
party
at
the
george
was
to
take
place
this
day
and
remembering
the
captain
promise
that
i
should
go
on
shore
whenever
i
pleased
i
thought
it
only
necessary
to
say
i
was
going
merely
passing
the
usual
compliment
to
my
superior
i
therefore
went
to
him
with
a
modest
assurance
and
told
him
of
my
engagement
and
my
intention
upon
my
honour
sir
cried
he
putting
his
arms
akimbo
and
staring
me
full
in
the
face
you
have
a
tolerable
of
modest
assurance
no
sooner
come
on
board
than
you
ask
leave
to
go
on
shore
again
and
at
the
same
time
you
have
the
impudence
to
tell
me
knowing
how
much
i
abhor
the
vice
that
you
mean
to
wet
your
commission
and
of
course
to
get
beastly
drunk
and
to
make
others
as
bad
as
yourself
no
sir
i
have
you
to
know
that
as
captain
of
this
ship
and
as
long
as
i
have
the
honour
to
command
her
i
am
that
is
precisely
what
i
was
coming
to
sir
said
i
when
you
interrupted
me
knowing
how
difficult
it
is
to
keep
young
men
in
order
without
the
presence
of
some
one
whom
they
respect
and
can
look
up
to
as
an
example
i
was
going
to
request
the
honour
of
your
company
as
my
guest
nothing
in
my
opinion
could
so
effectually
repress
any
tendency
to
improper
indulgence
there
you
speak
like
a
child
of
my
own
bringing
up
replied
captain
g
i
did
not
give
you
credit
for
so
much
good
sense
i
am
far
from
throwing
a
wet
blanket
over
any
innocent
mirth
man
is
man
after
all
give
him
but
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
and
he
is
no
more
than
a
dog
a
little
mirth
on
such
an
occasion
is
not
only
justifiable
but
praiseworthy
the
health
of
a
good
king
like
ours
god
bless
him
should
always
be
drank
in
good
wine
and
as
you
say
the
party
is
to
be
select
and
the
occasion
the
wetting
of
your
commission
i
shall
have
no
objection
to
come
and
give
away
the
bride
but
remember
no
hard
drinking
no
indecorum
and
i
do
my
best
not
only
to
keep
the
young
bloods
in
order
but
to
add
my
humble
powers
to
the
hilarity
of
the
evening
i
thanked
him
for
his
kind
condescension
he
then
gave
a
few
directions
to
skysail
the
first
lieutenant
and
ordering
his
gig
to
be
manned
offered
me
a
passage
on
shore
this
was
indeed
a
mark
of
favour
never
before
conferred
on
any
officer
in
the
ship
and
all
hands
spontaneously
turned
out
to
see
the
sight
the
first
lieutenant
cocked
his
eye
which
was
more
than
saying
this
is
too
good
to
last
long
however
into
the
boat
we
went
and
pulled
away
for
old
the
rolling
out
we
passed
close
to
the
buoy
of
the
ah
well
i
remember
that
old
ship
i
was
midshipman
of
her
when
she
blew
up
i
was
signal
midshipman
i
was
in
the
act
of
making
the
signal
of
distress
when
up
i
went
damnation
i
thought
i
never
should
have
come
down
any
more
indeed
sir
said
i
i
thought
there
had
been
no
one
on
board
at
the
time
no
one
on
board
repeated
the
captain
with
scorn
on
his
upper
lip
who
did
you
get
that
from
i
heard
it
from
a
captain
i
served
with
in
america
then
you
may
tell
your
captain
with
my
compliments
that
he
knew
nothing
at
all
about
it
no
one
on
board
why
d
me
sir
the
poop
was
crowded
like
a
sheepfold
and
all
bellowing
to
me
for
help
i
told
them
all
to
go
to
h
and
just
at
that
moment
away
we
all
went
sure
enough
i
was
picked
up
senseless
i
was
told
somewhere
in
and
carried
to
haslar
hospital
where
i
was
given
over
for
three
months
never
spoke
at
last
i
got
well
and
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
take
a
boat
and
go
and
dive
down
the
of
my
old
ship
and
swam
aft
to
the
and
what
did
you
see
sir
said
i
oh
nothing
except
lots
of
human
skeletons
and
whitings
in
abundance
swimming
between
their
ribs
i
brought
up
my
old
quadrant
out
of
the
starboard
wing
where
i
was
adjusting
it
when
the
alarm
was
given
i
found
it
lying
on
the
table
just
where
i
left
it
i
never
shall
forget
what
a
d
d
rap
we
hit
the
old
queen
charlotte
with
our
larboard
broadside
every
gun
went
slap
into
her
d
n
my
eyes
i
suppose
we
diddled
at
least
a
hundred
men
why
sir
said
i
i
always
understood
she
only
lost
two
men
on
that
occasion
who
told
you
that
said
captain
g
your
old
captain
yes
sir
said
i
he
was
a
midshipman
in
her
he
be
d
said
my
skipper
to
my
certain
knowledge
three
launch
loads
of
dead
bodies
were
taken
out
of
her
and
carried
to
the
hospital
for
interment
as
the
boat
touched
the
this
accomplished
liar
had
time
to
take
breath
and
in
fact
i
was
afraid
he
would
have
exhausted
his
stock
of
lies
before
dinner
and
kept
nothing
for
the
dessert
when
we
landed
he
went
to
his
old
quarters
at
the
star
and
garter
and
i
to
the
george
i
reminded
him
at
parting
that
six
was
my
hour
never
fear
me
said
he
i
collected
my
company
previous
to
his
arrival
and
told
my
friends
that
it
was
my
determination
to
make
him
drunk
and
that
they
must
assist
me
which
they
promised
to
do
having
once
placed
him
in
that
predicament
i
was
quite
sure
i
should
stop
his
future
discourses
in
favour
of
temperance
my
companions
perfectly
aware
of
the
sort
of
man
they
had
to
deal
with
treated
him
on
his
entrance
with
the
most
flattering
marks
of
respect
i
introduced
them
all
to
him
in
the
most
formal
manner
taking
them
to
him
one
by
one
just
as
we
are
presented
at
court
to
compare
great
things
with
small
his
was
at
its
highest
the
honour
of
drinking
wine
with
him
was
separately
and
respectfully
asked
and
most
condescendingly
granted
to
every
person
at
the
table
capital
salmon
this
said
the
captain
where
does
billett
get
it
from
by
the
by
talking
of
that
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
pickled
salmon
in
scotland
we
all
replied
in
the
affirmative
oh
you
do
take
d
it
i
do
mean
dead
pickled
salmon
i
mean
live
pickled
salmon
swimming
about
in
tanks
as
merry
as
grigs
and
as
hungry
as
rats
we
all
expressed
our
astonishment
at
this
and
declared
we
never
heard
of
it
before
i
thought
not
said
he
for
it
has
only
lately
been
introduced
into
this
country
by
a
particular
friend
of
mine
dr
mac
i
can
not
just
now
remember
his
d
d
scotch
name
he
was
a
great
chemist
and
geologist
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
a
clever
fellow
i
can
tell
you
though
you
may
laugh
well
this
fellow
sir
took
nature
by
the
heels
and
capsized
her
as
we
say
i
have
a
strong
idea
that
he
had
sold
himself
to
the
devil
well
what
does
he
do
but
he
catches
salmon
and
puts
them
into
tanks
and
every
day
added
more
and
more
salt
till
the
water
was
as
thick
as
gruel
and
the
fish
could
hardly
wag
their
tails
in
it
then
he
threw
in
whole
pepper
corns
pounds
at
a
time
till
there
was
enough
then
he
began
to
dilute
with
vinegar
until
his
pickle
was
complete
the
fish
did
not
half
like
it
at
first
but
habit
is
every
thing
and
when
he
shewed
me
his
tank
they
were
swimming
about
as
merry
as
a
shoal
of
dace
he
fed
them
with
fennel
chopped
small
and
corns
doctor
says
i
trust
no
man
upon
tick
if
i
do
taste
i
believe
my
own
eyes
though
i
believe
my
we
looked
at
each
other
you
shall
do
in
a
minute
says
he
so
he
whipped
one
of
them
out
with
a
landing
net
and
when
i
stuck
my
knife
into
him
the
pickle
ran
out
of
his
body
like
wine
out
of
a
claret
bottle
and
i
ate
at
least
two
pounds
of
the
rascal
while
he
flapped
his
tail
in
my
face
i
never
tasted
such
salmon
as
that
worth
your
while
to
go
to
scotland
if
it
only
for
the
sake
of
eating
live
pickled
salmon
i
give
you
a
letter
any
of
you
to
my
friend
he
be
d
d
glad
to
see
you
and
then
you
may
convince
yourselves
take
my
word
for
it
if
once
you
eat
salmon
that
way
you
will
never
eat
it
any
other
we
all
said
we
thought
that
very
likely
the
champagne
corks
flew
as
fast
and
as
loud
as
his
shells
at
acre
but
we
were
particularly
reserved
depending
entirely
on
his
tongue
for
our
amusement
and
finding
the
breeze
of
conversation
beginning
to
freshen
i
artfully
turned
the
subject
to
egypt
by
asking
one
of
my
friends
to
demolish
a
pyramid
of
jelly
which
stood
before
him
and
to
send
some
of
it
to
the
captain
this
was
enough
he
began
with
egypt
and
went
on
increasing
in
the
number
and
magnitude
of
his
lies
in
proportion
as
we
applauded
them
a
writer
ought
to
have
been
there
for
no
human
memory
could
do
justice
to
this
modern
munchausen
talking
of
the
water
of
the
nile
said
he
i
remember
when
i
was
first
lieutenant
of
the
i
went
into
minorca
with
only
six
tons
of
water
and
in
four
hours
we
had
three
hundred
and
fifty
tons
on
board
all
stowed
away
i
made
all
hands
work
the
admiral
himself
was
up
to
the
neck
in
water
with
the
rest
of
them
n
it
admiral
says
i
skulking
well
we
sailed
the
next
day
and
such
a
gale
of
wind
i
never
saw
in
all
my
life
away
went
all
our
masts
and
we
had
nearly
been
swamped
with
the
one
of
the
boats
was
blown
off
the
booms
and
went
clean
out
of
sight
before
it
touched
the
water
you
may
laugh
at
that
but
that
was
nothing
to
the
sloop
of
war
she
was
in
company
with
us
she
wanted
to
scud
for
it
but
by
jupiter
she
was
blown
two
miles
up
the
country
guns
men
and
all
and
the
next
morning
they
found
her
flying
had
gone
through
the
and
slap
into
the
cheek
of
the
picture
of
the
virgin
mary
the
natives
all
swore
it
was
done
on
purpose
by
d
d
heretics
the
captain
was
forced
to
arm
his
men
and
march
them
all
down
to
the
beach
giving
the
ship
up
to
the
people
who
were
so
exasperated
that
they
set
her
on
fire
and
never
thought
of
the
powder
which
was
on
board
all
the
priests
were
in
their
robes
singing
some
stuff
or
another
to
purify
the
church
but
that
was
so
much
time
thrown
away
for
in
one
moment
away
went
church
priests
pictures
and
people
all
to
the
devil
together
here
he
indulged
himself
in
some
vile
language
and
scurrilous
abuse
of
religion
and
its
ministers
all
priests
were
hypocritical
scoundrels
if
he
was
to
be
of
any
religion
at
all
he
said
he
should
prefer
being
a
roman
catholic
because
then
you
know
added
he
a
man
may
sin
as
much
as
he
likes
and
rub
off
as
he
goes
for
a
few
shillings
i
got
my
commission
by
religion
d
n
me
i
found
my
old
admiral
was
a
so
says
i
old
boy
i
give
you
enough
of
that
so
i
made
the
boatswain
stuff
me
a
hassock
and
this
i
carried
with
me
every
where
that
i
might
save
my
trowsers
and
not
hurt
my
knees
so
then
i
turned
to
and
prayed
all
day
long
and
kept
the
people
awake
singing
psalms
all
night
i
knelt
down
and
prayed
on
the
and
lower
deck
i
preached
to
the
men
in
the
tiers
when
they
coiled
the
cables
and
groaned
loud
and
deep
when
i
heard
an
oath
the
thing
took
the
admiral
said
i
was
the
right
sort
and
he
made
a
commander
out
of
the
greatest
atheist
in
the
ship
no
sooner
did
i
get
hold
of
the
sheepskin
than
to
the
devil
i
pitched
hassock
and
bible
how
long
he
might
have
gone
on
with
this
farrago
it
is
difficult
to
say
but
we
were
getting
tired
of
him
so
we
passed
the
bottle
till
he
left
off
narrative
and
took
to
friendship
now
i
say
hiccup
you
frank
you
are
a
devilish
good
fellow
but
that
son
of
a
gun
i
try
him
by
a
the
first
time
i
catch
him
drunk
i
hang
him
at
the
and
you
shall
be
my
first
lieutenant
and
d
n
me
only
you
come
and
tell
me
the
first
time
he
is
disguised
in
liquor
and
i
settle
him
d
n
his
cock
eye
a
saucy
of
a
hiccup
a
whitechapel
here
his
recollection
failed
him
he
began
to
talk
to
himself
and
to
confound
me
with
the
first
lieutenant
i
teach
him
to
write
to
for
leave
son
of
a
sea
cook
he
was
now
drawing
to
the
finale
and
began
to
sing
the
cook
of
the
huffy
got
drank
fell
down
the
and
broke
his
gin
bottle
here
his
head
fell
back
he
tumbled
off
his
chair
and
lay
motionless
on
the
carpet
having
previously
determined
not
to
let
him
be
exposed
in
the
streets
in
that
state
i
had
provided
a
bed
for
him
at
the
inn
and
ringing
the
bell
i
ordered
the
waiter
to
carry
him
to
it
having
seen
him
safely
deposited
untied
his
neckcloth
took
off
his
boots
and
raised
his
head
a
little
we
left
him
and
returned
to
the
table
where
we
finished
our
evening
in
great
comfort
but
without
any
other
instance
of
intoxication
the
next
morning
i
waited
on
him
he
seemed
much
annoyed
at
seeing
me
supposing
i
meant
by
my
presence
to
rebuke
him
for
his
intemperance
but
this
was
not
my
intention
i
asked
him
how
he
felt
and
i
regretted
that
the
hilarity
of
the
evening
had
been
interrupted
in
so
unfortunate
a
manner
how
do
you
mean
sir
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
was
not
sober
by
no
means
sir
said
i
but
are
you
aware
that
in
the
midst
of
your
delightful
and
entertaining
conversation
you
tumbled
off
your
chair
in
an
epileptic
fit
are
you
subject
to
these
oh
yes
my
dear
fellow
indeed
i
am
but
it
is
so
long
since
i
last
had
one
that
i
was
in
hopes
they
had
left
me
i
have
invalided
for
them
four
times
and
just
at
the
very
periods
when
if
i
could
have
remained
out
my
promotion
was
certain
he
then
told
me
i
might
remain
on
shore
that
day
if
i
pleased
i
gave
him
credit
for
his
happy
instinct
in
taking
the
hint
of
the
fit
and
as
soon
as
i
left
him
he
arose
went
on
board
and
flogged
two
men
for
being
drunk
the
night
before
i
did
not
fail
to
report
all
that
had
passed
to
my
messmates
and
we
sailed
a
few
days
afterwards
for
barbadoes
on
the
first
sunday
of
our
being
at
sea
the
captain
dined
in
the
with
the
officers
he
soon
launched
out
into
his
usual
strain
of
lying
and
boasting
which
always
irritated
our
doctor
who
was
a
sensible
young
welshman
on
these
occasions
he
never
failed
to
raise
a
laugh
at
the
captain
expense
by
throwing
in
one
or
two
words
at
the
end
of
each
anecdote
and
this
he
did
in
so
grave
and
modest
a
manner
that
without
a
previous
knowledge
of
him
anyone
might
have
supposed
he
was
serious
the
captain
renewed
his
story
of
the
corps
of
poodles
to
extract
the
fuses
from
the
shells
i
hoped
he
said
to
see
the
institution
of
such
a
corps
among
ourselves
and
if
i
were
to
be
the
colonel
of
it
i
should
soon
have
a
star
on
my
breast
that
would
be
the
dog
star
said
the
doctor
with
extreme
gaiety
thank
you
doctor
said
the
captain
not
bad
i
owe
you
one
we
laughed
the
doctor
kept
his
countenance
and
the
captain
looked
very
grave
but
he
continued
his
lies
and
dragged
in
as
usual
the
name
of
sir
sydney
smith
to
support
his
assertions
if
you
doubt
me
only
ask
sir
sydney
smith
he
talk
to
you
about
acre
for
hours
on
a
stretch
without
taking
breath
his
cockswain
at
last
got
so
tired
of
it
that
he
him
acre
the
poor
doctor
did
not
come
off
scot
free
the
next
day
he
discovered
that
the
deck
leaked
over
his
cabin
and
the
water
ran
into
his
bed
he
began
with
a
hammer
and
some
nails
to
fasten
up
a
piece
of
painted
canvas
by
way
of
shelter
the
captain
heard
the
noise
of
the
hammer
and
finding
it
was
the
doctor
desired
him
to
desist
the
doctor
replied
that
he
was
only
endeavouring
to
stop
some
leaks
over
his
bed
the
captain
said
they
should
not
be
stopped
for
that
a
bed
of
leeks
was
a
very
good
bed
for
a
welshman
there
doctor
now
we
are
quits
that
for
your
dog
star
i
suppose
you
think
nobody
can
make
a
pun
or
a
pill
in
the
ship
but
yourself
if
my
pills
were
no
better
than
your
puns
muttered
the
doctor
we
should
all
be
in
a
bad
way
the
captain
then
directed
the
carpenter
not
to
allow
any
nails
to
the
doctor
or
the
use
of
any
of
his
tools
he
even
told
the
poor
surgeon
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
make
a
pill
and
that
he
was
as
useless
as
the
navy
board
he
accused
him
of
ignorance
in
other
parts
of
his
profession
and
ordering
all
the
sick
men
on
deck
them
to
increase
their
circulation
and
put
a
little
life
into
them
many
a
poor
sick
creature
have
i
seen
receive
a
most
unmerciful
beating
my
wonder
was
that
the
men
did
not
throw
him
overboard
and
i
do
really
believe
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
respect
and
love
to
the
officers
they
would
have
done
so
no
sooner
had
we
got
into
blue
water
as
he
called
it
that
is
out
of
soundings
than
he
began
his
pranks
which
never
ceased
till
we
reached
carlisle
bay
officers
and
men
were
all
treated
alike
and
there
was
no
redress
for
no
one
among
us
dared
to
bring
him
to
a
his
constant
maxim
was
keep
sailors
at
work
and
you
keep
the
devil
out
of
their
minds
all
hands
all
and
watch
all
night
no
man
said
jacky
the
name
we
gave
him
eats
the
bread
of
idleness
on
board
of
my
ship
work
keeps
the
scurvy
out
of
their
bones
the
lazy
rascals
the
officers
and
men
for
the
first
three
weeks
never
had
a
watch
below
during
the
day
they
were
harassed
and
worn
to
death
and
the
most
mutinous
and
discontented
spirit
prevailed
throughout
the
ship
one
of
the
best
seamen
said
in
the
captain
hearing
that
since
the
ship
had
been
at
sea
he
had
only
had
three
watches
below
and
if
i
had
known
it
said
the
captain
you
should
not
have
had
that
and
turning
the
hands
up
he
gave
him
four
dozen
whenever
he
flogged
the
men
which
he
was
constantly
doing
he
never
failed
to
upbraid
them
with
ingratitude
and
the
indulgences
which
they
received
from
him
by
g
d
there
is
no
in
the
service
that
has
so
much
indulgence
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
keep
the
ship
clean
square
the
yards
hoist
in
your
provisions
eat
them
hoist
your
grog
in
drink
it
and
strike
the
empty
casks
over
the
side
but
heaven
itself
would
not
please
such
a
set
of
d
d
fat
lazy
discontented
rascals
his
language
to
the
officers
was
beyond
any
thing
i
ever
could
have
supposed
would
have
proceeded
from
the
mouth
of
a
human
being
the
master
one
day
incurred
his
displeasure
and
he
very
flippantly
told
the
poor
man
to
go
to
h
i
hope
sir
said
the
master
i
have
as
good
a
chance
of
going
to
heaven
as
yourself
you
go
to
heaven
said
the
captain
you
go
to
heaven
let
me
catch
you
there
and
i
will
come
and
kick
you
out
this
was
indeed
shewing
how
far
he
would
have
carried
his
tyranny
if
he
could
but
our
feelings
are
relieved
from
any
violent
shock
at
this
apparent
blasphemy
when
we
recollect
that
the
poor
man
was
an
atheist
and
that
his
idea
of
heaven
was
that
of
a
little
parlour
at
the
star
and
garter
with
a
good
fire
plenty
of
grog
and
pipes
of
tobacco
he
kept
no
table
nor
did
he
ever
drink
any
wine
except
when
he
dined
with
us
but
got
drunk
every
night
more
or
less
on
the
spirits
in
his
own
cabin
he
was
always
most
violent
in
the
evening
our
only
revenge
was
laughing
at
his
monstrous
lies
on
sunday
when
he
dined
with
us
one
night
his
servant
came
and
told
the
midshipman
of
the
watch
that
the
captain
was
lying
dead
drunk
on
the
deck
in
his
cabin
this
was
communicated
to
me
and
i
determined
to
make
the
best
use
of
it
i
ran
down
to
the
cabin
taking
with
me
the
midshipman
of
the
watch
the
and
two
other
steady
men
and
having
laid
the
in
his
bed
i
noted
down
the
date
with
all
the
particulars
together
with
the
names
of
the
witnesses
to
be
used
as
soon
as
we
fell
in
with
the
admiral
the
next
day
i
think
he
had
some
suspicion
of
what
i
had
done
and
it
had
nearly
been
fatal
to
me
it
was
blowing
a
fresh
trade
wind
and
the
vessel
rolling
very
deep
when
he
ordered
the
booms
to
be
cast
loose
and
this
was
nothing
short
of
murder
and
madness
but
in
spite
of
every
remonstrance
he
persisted
and
the
consequences
were
terrible
the
lashings
were
no
sooner
cast
off
than
a
spare
fell
and
killed
one
of
the
men
this
was
enough
to
have
completed
our
mischief
for
the
day
but
the
devil
had
not
done
with
us
yet
the
booms
were
secured
and
the
men
were
ordered
to
rattle
the
rigging
down
which
as
the
vessel
continued
to
roll
heavily
was
still
more
dangerous
and
if
possible
more
useless
than
the
former
operation
he
was
warned
of
it
but
in
vain
and
the
men
had
not
been
aloft
more
than
ten
minutes
when
one
of
them
fell
overboard
why
i
should
again
have
put
my
life
in
jeopardy
particularly
after
the
warning
of
the
last
voyage
i
know
not
i
was
perhaps
vain
of
what
i
could
do
in
the
water
i
knew
my
powers
and
with
the
hope
of
saving
this
unfortunate
victim
to
the
folly
and
cruelty
of
the
captain
i
plunged
after
him
into
the
sea
feeling
at
the
same
time
that
i
was
almost
committing
an
act
of
suicide
i
caught
hold
of
him
and
for
a
time
supported
him
and
had
the
commonest
diligence
and
seamanship
been
shewn
i
should
have
saved
him
but
the
captain
it
appeared
when
he
found
i
was
overboard
was
resolved
to
get
rid
of
me
in
order
to
save
himself
he
made
use
of
every
difficulty
to
prevent
the
boat
coming
to
me
the
poor
man
was
exhausted
i
kept
myself
disengaged
from
him
when
swimming
round
him
supported
him
occasionally
whenever
he
was
sinking
but
finding
at
last
that
he
was
irrecoverably
gone
for
though
i
had
a
firm
hold
of
him
he
was
going
lower
and
lower
and
looking
up
perceiving
i
was
so
deep
that
the
water
was
dark
over
my
head
i
clapped
my
knees
on
his
shoulders
and
giving
myself
a
little
impetus
from
the
resistance
rose
to
the
surface
so
much
was
i
exhausted
that
i
could
not
have
floated
half
a
minute
more
when
the
boat
came
and
picked
me
up
the
delay
in
heaving
the
ship
to
i
attributed
to
the
scene
i
had
witnessed
the
night
before
and
in
this
i
was
confirmed
by
the
testimony
of
the
officers
having
lost
two
men
by
his
unseamanlike
conduct
he
would
have
added
deliberate
murder
of
a
third
to
save
himself
from
the
punishment
which
he
knew
awaited
him
he
continued
the
same
tyrannical
conduct
and
i
had
resolved
that
the
moment
we
fell
in
with
the
admiral
to
write
for
a
on
this
man
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
i
thought
i
should
serve
my
country
and
the
navy
by
ridding
it
of
such
a
monster
several
of
the
officers
were
under
arrest
and
notwithstanding
the
heat
of
their
cabins
in
that
warm
climate
were
kept
constantly
confined
to
them
with
a
sentinel
at
the
door
in
consequence
of
this
cruel
treatment
one
of
the
officers
became
deranged
we
made
barbadoes
and
running
round
needham
point
into
carlisle
bay
we
saw
to
our
mortification
that
neither
the
admiral
nor
any
ship
of
war
was
there
consequently
our
captain
was
commanding
officer
in
the
port
upon
this
he
became
remarkably
amiable
supposing
if
the
evil
day
was
put
off
it
would
be
dispensed
with
altogether
he
treated
me
with
particular
attention
hoped
we
should
have
some
fun
ashore
as
the
admiral
was
not
come
in
we
should
wait
for
him
tired
of
kicking
about
at
sea
he
should
take
all
his
with
him
and
bring
himself
to
an
anchor
on
shore
and
not
come
afloat
again
till
we
saluted
his
flag
neither
the
first
lieutenant
nor
myself
believed
one
word
of
this
indeed
we
always
acted
upon
the
exact
reverse
of
what
he
said
and
it
was
well
we
did
so
in
this
instance
after
we
had
anchored
he
went
ashore
and
in
about
an
hour
returned
and
stated
that
the
admiral
was
not
expected
till
next
month
that
he
should
therefore
go
and
take
up
his
quarters
at
jemmy
cavan
and
not
trouble
the
ship
any
more
until
the
admiral
arrived
he
then
left
us
taking
his
trunk
and
all
his
dirty
linen
dirty
enough
it
was
some
of
the
officers
unfortunately
believed
that
we
were
to
remain
and
followed
the
captain
example
by
sending
their
linen
on
shore
to
be
washed
skysail
was
firm
and
so
was
i
the
lieutenant
cocked
his
eye
and
said
messmate
depend
on
it
there
is
something
in
the
wind
i
have
sent
one
shirt
on
shore
to
be
washed
and
when
that
comes
off
i
will
send
another
if
i
lose
that
it
is
no
great
matter
that
night
at
ten
captain
jacky
came
on
board
bringing
his
trunk
and
dirty
linen
turned
the
hands
up
up
anchor
and
ran
out
of
carlisle
bay
and
went
to
sea
leaving
most
of
the
officers
linen
on
shore
this
was
one
of
his
tricks
he
had
received
his
orders
when
he
landed
in
the
morning
they
were
waiting
for
him
and
his
coming
on
board
for
his
things
was
only
a
run
to
throw
us
off
our
guard
and
i
suppose
compel
us
by
the
loss
of
our
clothes
to
be
as
dirty
in
appearance
as
he
was
himself
but
he
always
liked
to
make
his
officers
comfortable
we
arrived
at
nassau
in
new
providence
without
any
remarkable
incident
although
the
service
continued
to
be
carried
on
in
the
same
disagreeable
manner
as
ever
i
continued
however
to
get
leave
to
go
on
shore
and
finding
no
prospect
of
bringing
the
captain
to
justice
determined
to
quit
the
ship
if
possible
this
was
effected
by
accident
otherwise
i
should
have
been
much
puzzled
to
have
got
clear
of
her
i
fell
between
the
boat
and
the
wharf
as
i
landed
and
by
the
sudden
jerk
ruptured
a
small
bloodvessel
in
my
chest
it
was
of
no
great
importance
in
itself
but
in
that
climate
required
care
and
i
made
the
most
of
it
they
would
have
carried
me
on
board
again
but
i
begged
to
be
taken
to
the
hotel
the
surgeon
of
the
regiment
doing
duty
there
attended
me
and
i
requested
him
to
make
my
case
as
bad
as
possible
the
captain
came
to
see
me
i
appeared
very
ill
his
compassion
was
like
that
of
the
inquisitor
of
the
holy
office
who
cures
his
victim
in
order
to
enable
him
to
go
through
further
torments
his
time
of
sailing
arrived
and
i
was
reported
to
be
too
ill
to
be
removed
determined
to
have
me
he
prolonged
his
stay
i
got
better
the
surgeon
report
was
more
favourable
but
i
was
still
unwilling
to
go
on
board
the
captain
sent
me
an
affectionate
message
to
say
that
if
i
did
not
come
he
would
send
a
file
of
marines
to
bring
me
he
even
came
himself
and
threatened
me
when
finding
there
were
no
witnesses
in
the
room
i
plainly
told
him
that
if
he
persisted
in
having
me
on
board
it
would
be
to
his
own
destruction
for
that
i
was
fully
determined
to
bring
him
to
a
for
drunkenness
and
unofficerlike
conduct
the
moment
we
joined
the
admiral
i
told
him
of
the
state
in
which
i
had
found
him
i
recapitulated
his
blasphemies
and
his
lubberly
conduct
in
losing
the
two
men
he
stared
and
endeavoured
to
explain
i
was
peremptory
and
he
whined
and
gave
in
seeing
he
was
in
my
power
well
then
my
dear
fellow
said
jacky
since
you
are
so
very
ill
sorry
as
i
shall
be
to
lose
you
i
must
consent
to
your
staying
behind
i
shall
find
it
difficult
to
replace
you
but
as
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
my
officers
is
my
first
object
on
all
occasions
i
will
prefer
annoying
myself
to
annoying
you
so
saying
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
which
i
shook
with
a
hearty
sincerely
hoping
that
we
might
never
meet
again
either
in
this
world
or
the
next
he
was
afterwards
brought
to
a
for
repeated
acts
of
drunkenness
and
cruelty
and
was
finally
dismissed
the
service
in
giving
this
detail
of
captain
g
peculiarities
let
it
not
be
imagined
that
even
at
that
period
such
characters
were
common
in
the
service
i
have
already
said
that
he
was
an
unique
impressment
and
the
want
of
officers
at
the
early
part
of
the
war
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
becoming
a
lieutenant
he
took
the
weak
side
of
the
admiral
to
obtain
his
next
step
and
obtained
the
command
of
a
sloop
from
repeated
solicitation
at
the
admiralty
and
by
urging
his
claims
of
long
servitude
the
service
had
received
serious
injury
by
admitting
men
on
the
from
before
the
mast
it
occasioned
there
being
two
classes
of
officers
in
the
navy
namely
those
who
had
rank
and
connections
and
those
who
had
entered
by
the
as
they
were
described
the
first
were
favoured
when
young
and
did
not
acquire
a
competent
knowledge
of
their
duty
the
second
with
few
exceptions
as
they
advanced
in
their
grades
proved
from
want
of
education
more
and
more
unfit
for
their
stations
these
defects
have
now
been
remedied
and
as
all
young
men
who
enter
the
service
must
have
a
regular
education
and
consequently
be
the
sons
of
gentlemen
a
level
has
been
produced
which
to
a
certain
degree
precludes
favouritism
and
perfectly
bars
the
entrance
to
such
men
as
captain
g
after
the
battle
of
trafalgar
when
england
and
europe
were
indebted
for
their
safety
to
the
british
fleet
the
navy
became
popular
and
the
aristocracy
crowded
into
it
this
forwarded
still
more
the
melioration
of
the
service
and
under
the
succeeding
naval
administration
silent
certain
and
gradual
improvements
both
in
men
officers
and
ships
took
place
subsequently
the
navy
has
been
still
more
fortunate
in
having
an
officer
called
to
its
councils
whose
active
and
constant
employment
at
sea
previous
to
the
peace
of
paris
had
given
him
a
thorough
insight
into
its
wants
and
abuses
unconnected
with
party
and
unawed
by
power
he
has
dared
to
do
his
duty
and
it
is
highly
to
the
credit
of
the
first
lord
who
has
so
long
presided
at
the
board
that
the
suggestions
of
this
officer
have
met
with
due
consideration
i
can
therefore
assure
my
reader
that
as
long
as
his
advice
is
attended
to
he
need
be
afraid
of
meeting
with
no
more
captain
g
chapter
xviii
there
she
goes
brimful
of
anger
and
jealousy
mercy
on
the
poor
man
the
dreadful
fish
that
hath
deserved
the
name
of
death
spenser
as
the
brig
moved
out
of
the
harbour
of
nassau
i
moved
out
of
bed
and
as
she
set
her
royals
and
made
sail
i
put
on
my
hat
and
walked
out
the
officers
of
the
regiment
quartered
there
kindly
invited
me
to
join
their
mess
and
the
colonel
enhanced
the
value
of
the
offer
by
assigning
for
me
good
apartments
in
the
barracks
i
was
instantly
removed
to
cleanly
and
comfortable
lodgings
i
soon
regained
my
strength
and
was
able
to
sit
at
the
table
where
i
found
young
officers
living
for
the
day
careless
of
the
morrow
and
beyond
that
never
bestowing
a
thought
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
where
life
is
most
precarious
men
are
most
indifferent
about
its
preservation
and
where
death
is
constantly
before
our
eyes
as
in
this
country
eternity
is
seldom
in
our
thoughts
but
so
it
is
and
the
rule
extends
still
further
in
despotic
countries
where
the
union
between
the
head
and
shoulders
may
be
dissolved
in
a
moment
by
the
sword
of
a
tyrant
life
is
not
so
valued
and
death
loses
its
terrors
hence
the
apathy
and
indifference
with
which
men
view
their
executioners
in
that
state
of
society
it
seems
as
if
existence
like
estates
was
valuable
in
proportion
to
the
validity
of
the
by
which
they
are
held
to
digress
no
more
although
i
was
far
from
being
even
commonly
virtuous
which
is
about
tantamount
to
absolute
wickedness
i
was
no
longer
the
thoughtless
mortal
i
had
ever
been
since
i
left
school
the
society
of
emily
and
her
image
graven
on
my
heart
the
close
confinement
to
the
brig
and
the
narrow
escape
from
death
in
the
second
attempt
to
save
the
poor
sailor
life
had
altogether
contributed
their
share
to
a
kind
of
temporary
reformation
if
not
to
a
disgust
to
the
coarser
descriptions
of
vice
the
lecture
i
had
received
from
emily
on
deceit
and
the
detestable
conduct
of
my
last
captain
had
as
i
thought
almost
completed
my
reformation
hitherto
i
felt
i
had
acted
wrong
without
having
the
power
to
act
right
i
forgot
that
i
had
never
made
the
experiment
the
declaration
of
captain
atheism
was
so
far
from
converting
me
that
from
that
moment
i
thought
more
seriously
than
ever
of
religion
so
great
was
my
contempt
for
his
character
that
i
knew
whatever
he
said
must
be
wrong
and
like
the
spartan
drunken
slave
he
gave
me
the
greatest
horror
of
vice
such
was
my
reasoning
and
such
my
sentiments
previous
to
any
relapse
into
sin
or
folly
i
knew
its
heinousness
i
transgressed
and
repented
habit
was
in
me
and
the
only
firm
support
i
could
have
looked
to
for
assistance
was
unfortunately
very
superficially
attended
to
religion
for
any
good
purposes
was
scarcely
in
my
thoughts
my
system
was
a
sort
of
socratic
heathen
philosophy
a
moral
code
calculated
to
take
a
man
tolerably
safe
through
a
quiet
world
but
not
to
extricate
him
from
a
labyrinth
of
iniquity
the
thoughtless
and
vicious
conduct
of
my
companions
became
to
me
a
source
of
serious
reflection
far
from
following
their
example
i
felt
myself
some
degrees
better
than
they
were
and
in
the
pride
of
my
heart
thanked
god
that
i
was
not
like
these
publicans
my
pharisaical
arrogance
concealed
from
me
the
mortifying
fact
that
i
was
much
worse
and
with
very
slight
hopes
of
amendment
humility
had
not
yet
entered
my
mind
but
it
was
the
only
basis
on
which
any
religious
improvement
could
be
created
the
only
chance
of
being
saved
i
rather
became
refined
in
vice
without
quitting
it
gross
and
sensual
gratification
so
easily
obtained
in
the
west
indies
was
disgusting
to
me
yet
i
scrupled
not
to
attempt
the
seduction
of
innocence
rather
more
gratified
in
the
pursuit
than
in
the
enjoyment
which
soon
palled
and
drove
me
after
other
objects
i
had
however
little
occasion
to
exert
my
tact
in
this
art
in
the
bahama
islands
where
as
in
all
the
other
islands
of
the
west
indies
there
is
a
class
of
women
born
of
white
fathers
and
mustee
or
mulatto
women
nearly
approaching
in
complexion
to
the
european
many
of
them
are
brunettes
with
long
black
hair
very
pretty
good
eyes
and
often
elegant
figures
these
ladies
are
too
proud
of
the
european
blood
in
their
veins
to
form
an
alliance
with
any
male
who
has
a
suspicion
of
black
in
his
genealogical
table
consequently
they
seldom
are
married
unless
from
interested
motives
when
having
acquired
large
property
by
will
they
are
sought
in
wedlock
by
the
white
settlers
so
circumstanced
these
girls
prefer
an
intercourse
with
the
object
of
their
choice
to
a
legal
marriage
with
a
person
of
inferior
birth
and
having
once
made
their
selection
an
act
of
infidelity
is
of
rare
occurrence
among
them
their
affection
and
constancy
will
stand
the
test
of
time
and
of
long
separation
generous
to
prodigality
but
jealous
and
irritable
in
their
jealousy
even
to
the
use
of
the
dagger
and
poison
one
of
these
young
ladies
found
sufficient
allurement
in
my
personal
charms
to
surrender
at
discretion
and
we
lived
in
that
sort
of
familiar
intercourse
which
in
the
west
indies
is
looked
upon
as
a
matter
of
necessity
between
the
parties
and
of
indifference
by
every
one
else
i
lived
on
in
this
epicurean
style
for
some
months
until
most
unfortunately
my
found
a
rival
in
the
daughter
of
an
officer
high
in
rank
on
the
island
smitten
with
my
person
this
fair
one
had
not
the
prudence
to
conceal
her
partiality
my
vanity
was
too
much
flattered
not
to
take
advantage
of
her
sentiments
in
my
favour
and
as
usual
flirtation
and
philandering
occupied
most
of
my
mornings
and
sometimes
my
evenings
in
the
company
of
this
fair
american
scandal
is
a
goddess
who
reigns
paramount
not
only
in
great
britain
but
also
in
all
his
majesty
plantations
and
her
votaries
very
soon
selected
me
as
the
target
of
their
archery
my
pretty
carlotta
became
jealous
she
taxed
me
with
inconstancy
i
denied
the
charge
and
as
a
proof
of
my
innocence
she
obtained
from
me
a
promise
that
i
should
go
no
more
to
the
house
of
her
rival
but
this
promise
i
took
very
good
care
to
evade
and
to
break
for
a
whole
fortnight
my
domestic
peace
was
interrupted
either
by
tears
or
by
the
most
voluble
and
outrageous
solos
for
i
never
replied
after
the
first
day
a
little
female
slave
one
morning
made
me
a
signal
to
follow
her
to
a
retired
part
of
the
garden
i
had
shewn
this
poor
little
creature
some
acts
of
kindness
for
which
she
amply
repaid
me
sometimes
i
had
obtained
for
her
a
holiday
sometimes
saved
her
a
whipping
and
at
others
had
given
her
a
trifle
of
money
she
therefore
became
exceedingly
attached
to
me
and
as
she
saw
her
mistress
anger
daily
increase
she
knew
what
it
would
probably
end
in
and
watched
my
safety
like
a
little
guardian
sylph
no
drinkee
coffee
massa
said
she
missy
putty
obeah
stuff
in
as
soon
as
she
had
said
this
she
disappeared
and
i
went
into
the
house
where
i
found
carlotta
preparing
the
breakfast
she
had
an
old
woman
with
her
who
seemed
to
be
doing
something
which
she
was
not
very
willing
i
should
see
i
sat
down
carelessly
humming
a
tune
with
my
face
to
a
mirror
and
my
back
to
carlotta
so
that
i
was
able
to
watch
her
motions
without
her
perceiving
it
she
was
standing
near
the
fireplace
the
coffee
was
by
her
on
the
table
and
the
old
woman
crouched
in
the
chimney
corner
with
her
bleared
eyes
fixed
on
the
embers
carlotta
seemed
in
doubt
she
pressed
her
hands
forcibly
on
her
forehead
took
up
the
to
pour
me
out
a
cup
then
sat
it
down
again
the
old
woman
muttered
something
in
their
language
carlotta
stamped
with
her
little
foot
and
poured
out
the
coffee
she
brought
it
to
me
trembled
as
she
placed
it
before
me
seemed
unwilling
to
let
go
her
hold
and
her
hand
still
grasped
the
cup
as
if
she
would
take
it
away
again
the
old
woman
growled
and
muttered
something
in
which
i
could
only
hear
the
name
of
her
rival
mentioned
this
was
enough
the
eyes
of
carlotta
lighted
up
like
a
flame
she
quitted
her
hold
of
the
salver
retreated
to
the
fireplace
sat
herself
down
covered
her
face
and
left
me
as
she
supposed
to
make
my
last
earthly
repast
carlotta
said
i
with
a
sudden
and
vehement
exclamation
she
started
up
and
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
and
neck
in
a
profusion
of
blushes
which
are
perfectly
visible
through
the
skins
of
these
mulattos
carlotta
i
repeated
i
had
a
dream
last
night
and
who
do
you
think
came
to
me
it
was
obeah
she
started
at
the
name
he
told
me
not
to
drink
coffee
this
morning
but
to
make
the
old
woman
drink
it
at
these
words
the
beldam
sprang
up
come
here
you
old
hag
said
i
she
approached
trembling
for
she
saw
that
escape
from
me
was
impossible
and
that
her
guilt
was
detected
i
seized
a
sharp
knife
and
taking
her
by
her
few
remaining
grey
and
woolly
hairs
said
obeah
work
must
be
done
i
do
not
order
it
but
he
commands
it
drink
that
coffee
instantly
so
powerful
was
the
name
of
obeah
on
the
ear
of
the
hag
that
she
dreaded
it
more
than
my
brandished
knife
she
never
thought
of
imploring
mercy
for
she
supposed
it
was
useless
after
the
discovery
and
that
her
hour
was
come
she
therefore
lifted
the
cup
to
her
withered
lip
and
was
just
going
to
fulfil
her
destiny
and
to
drink
when
i
dashed
it
out
of
her
hand
and
broke
it
in
a
thousand
pieces
on
the
floor
darting
at
the
same
time
a
fierce
look
at
carlotta
who
threw
herself
at
my
feet
which
she
fervently
kissed
in
an
agony
of
conflicting
passions
kill
me
kill
me
ejaculated
she
it
was
i
that
did
it
obeah
is
great
he
has
saved
you
kill
me
and
i
shall
die
happy
now
you
are
safe
do
kill
me
i
listened
to
these
frantic
exclamations
with
perfect
calmness
when
she
was
a
little
more
composed
i
desired
her
to
rise
she
obeyed
and
looked
the
image
of
despair
for
she
thought
i
should
immediately
quit
her
for
the
arms
of
her
more
fortunate
rival
and
she
considered
my
innocence
as
fully
established
by
the
appearance
of
the
deity
carlotta
said
i
what
would
you
have
done
if
you
had
succeeded
in
killing
me
i
will
shew
you
said
she
when
going
to
a
closet
the
took
out
another
basin
of
coffee
and
before
i
could
dash
it
from
her
lips
as
i
had
the
former
one
from
the
black
woman
the
infatuated
girl
had
swallowed
a
small
portion
of
it
what
else
can
i
do
said
she
my
happiness
is
gone
for
ever
no
carlotta
said
i
i
do
not
wish
for
your
death
though
you
have
plotted
mine
i
have
been
faithful
to
you
and
loved
you
until
you
made
this
attempt
will
you
forgive
me
before
i
die
said
she
for
die
i
must
now
that
i
know
you
will
quit
me
uttering
these
words
she
threw
herself
on
the
floor
with
violence
and
her
head
coming
in
contact
with
the
broken
fragments
of
the
basin
she
cut
herself
and
bled
so
copiously
that
she
fainted
the
old
woman
had
fled
and
i
was
left
alone
with
her
for
poor
little
sophy
was
frightened
and
had
hidden
herself
i
lifted
carlotta
from
the
floor
and
placing
her
in
a
chair
i
washed
her
face
with
cold
water
and
having
staunched
the
blood
i
laid
her
on
her
bed
when
she
began
to
breathe
and
to
sob
convulsively
i
sat
myself
by
her
side
and
as
i
contemplated
her
pale
face
and
witnessed
her
grief
i
fell
into
a
train
of
melancholy
retrospection
on
my
numerous
acts
of
vice
and
folly
how
many
warnings
said
i
how
many
lessons
am
i
to
receive
before
i
shall
reform
how
narrowly
have
i
escaped
being
sent
to
my
account
and
unprepared
what
must
have
been
my
situation
if
i
had
at
this
moment
been
called
into
the
presence
of
my
offended
creator
this
poor
girl
is
pure
and
innocent
compared
with
me
taking
into
consideration
the
advantages
of
education
on
my
side
and
the
want
of
it
on
hers
what
has
produced
all
this
misery
and
the
dreadful
consequences
which
might
have
ensued
but
my
folly
in
trifling
with
the
feelings
of
an
innocent
girl
and
winning
her
affections
merely
to
gratify
my
own
vanity
at
the
same
time
that
i
have
formed
a
connection
with
this
unhappy
creature
the
breaking
of
which
will
never
cause
me
one
hour
regret
while
it
will
leave
her
in
misery
and
will
in
all
probability
embitter
all
her
future
existence
what
shall
i
do
forgive
as
i
hope
to
be
forgiven
the
fault
was
more
mine
than
hers
i
then
knelt
down
and
most
fervently
repeated
the
lord
prayer
adding
some
words
of
thanksgiving
for
my
undeserved
escape
from
death
i
rose
up
and
kissed
her
cold
damp
forehead
she
was
sensible
of
my
kindness
and
her
poor
head
found
relief
in
a
flood
of
tears
her
eyes
again
gazed
on
me
sparkling
with
gratitude
and
love
after
all
she
had
gone
through
i
endeavoured
to
compose
her
the
loss
of
blood
had
produced
the
best
effects
and
having
succeeded
in
calming
her
conflicting
passions
she
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
the
reader
who
knows
the
west
indies
or
knows
human
nature
will
not
be
surprised
that
i
should
have
continued
this
connection
as
long
as
i
remained
on
the
island
from
the
artless
manner
in
which
carlotta
had
conducted
her
plot
from
her
gestures
and
her
agitation
i
was
quite
sure
that
she
was
a
novice
in
this
sort
of
crime
and
that
should
she
ever
relapse
into
her
paroxysm
of
jealousy
i
should
be
able
to
detect
any
farther
attempt
on
my
life
of
this
however
i
had
no
fears
having
by
degrees
discontinued
my
visits
to
the
young
lady
who
had
been
the
cause
of
our
fracas
and
i
never
afterwards
while
on
the
island
gave
carlotta
the
slightest
reason
to
suspect
my
constancy
i
was
much
censured
for
my
conduct
to
the
young
lady
as
the
attentions
i
had
shewn
her
and
her
marked
preference
for
me
had
driven
away
suitors
who
really
were
in
earnest
and
they
never
returned
to
her
again
in
these
islands
the
naturalist
would
find
a
vast
store
to
reward
investigation
they
abound
with
a
variety
of
plants
birds
fish
shells
and
minerals
it
was
here
that
columbus
made
his
first
landing
but
in
which
of
the
islands
i
am
not
exactly
certain
though
i
am
very
sure
he
did
not
find
them
quite
so
agreeable
as
i
did
for
he
very
soon
quitted
them
and
steered
away
for
st
domingo
it
is
not
perhaps
generally
known
that
new
providence
was
the
island
selected
for
his
residence
by
blackbeard
the
famous
pirate
the
citadel
that
stands
on
the
hill
above
the
town
of
nassau
is
built
on
the
site
of
the
fortress
which
contained
the
treasure
of
that
famous
freebooter
a
curious
circumstance
occurred
during
my
stay
on
this
island
and
which
beyond
all
doubt
was
connected
with
the
adventures
of
those
extraordinary
people
known
by
the
appellation
of
buccaneers
some
workmen
were
digging
near
the
foot
of
the
hill
under
the
fort
when
they
discovered
some
quicksilver
and
on
inspection
a
very
considerable
quantity
was
found
it
had
evidently
been
a
part
of
the
plunder
of
the
pirates
buried
in
casks
or
skins
and
these
having
decayed
the
liquid
ore
naturally
escaped
down
the
hill
though
not
indifferent
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
i
was
far
from
resigning
myself
to
the
circean
life
led
by
the
generality
of
young
military
men
in
the
bahamas
the
education
which
i
had
received
and
which
placed
me
far
above
the
common
run
of
society
in
the
colonies
induced
me
to
seek
for
a
companion
whose
mind
had
received
equal
cultivation
and
such
a
one
i
found
in
charles
a
young
lieutenant
in
the
regiment
quartered
at
nassau
our
intimacy
became
the
closer
in
proportion
as
we
discovered
the
sottish
habits
and
ignorance
of
those
around
us
we
usually
spent
our
mornings
in
reading
the
classic
authors
with
which
we
were
both
familiar
we
spouted
our
latin
verses
we
fenced
and
we
amused
ourselves
occasionally
with
a
game
of
billiards
but
never
ventured
our
friendship
on
a
stake
for
money
when
the
heat
of
the
day
had
passed
off
we
strolled
out
paid
a
few
visits
or
rambled
over
the
island
keeping
as
much
aloof
from
the
barracks
as
possible
where
the
manner
of
living
was
so
very
uncongenial
to
our
notions
the
officers
began
their
day
about
noon
when
they
sat
down
to
breakfast
after
that
they
separated
to
their
different
quarters
to
read
the
novels
with
which
the
presses
of
england
and
france
inundated
these
islands
to
the
great
deterioration
of
morals
these
books
which
they
read
lounging
on
their
backs
or
laid
beside
them
and
fell
asleep
over
occupied
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
the
remainder
till
the
hour
of
dinner
arrived
was
consumed
in
visiting
and
gossiping
or
in
riding
to
procure
an
appetite
for
dinner
till
four
in
the
morning
their
time
was
wholly
devoted
to
smoking
and
drinking
their
beds
received
them
in
a
state
of
intoxication
more
or
less
parade
at
nine
forced
them
out
with
a
burning
brain
and
parched
tongue
they
rushed
into
the
sea
and
found
some
refreshment
in
the
cool
water
which
enabled
them
to
stand
upright
in
front
of
their
men
the
formal
duty
over
they
retired
again
to
their
beds
where
they
lay
till
noon
and
then
to
breakfast
such
were
their
days
can
it
be
wondered
at
that
our
islands
are
fatal
to
the
constitution
of
europeans
when
this
is
their
manner
of
life
in
a
climate
always
disposed
to
take
advantage
of
any
excess
the
men
too
readily
followed
the
example
of
their
officers
and
died
off
in
the
same
rapid
manner
one
of
the
most
regular
employments
of
the
morning
was
to
dig
graves
for
the
victims
of
the
night
four
or
five
of
these
receptacles
was
thought
a
moderate
number
such
was
the
fatal
apathy
in
which
these
officers
existed
that
the
approach
nay
even
the
certainty
of
death
gave
them
no
apparent
concern
caused
no
preparation
excited
no
serious
reflection
they
followed
the
corpse
of
a
to
the
grave
in
military
procession
these
ceremonies
were
always
conducted
in
the
evening
and
often
have
i
seen
these
thoughtless
young
men
throwing
stones
at
the
lanthorns
which
were
carried
before
them
to
light
them
to
the
i
was
always
an
early
riser
and
believe
i
owe
much
of
my
good
health
to
this
custom
i
used
to
delight
in
a
lovely
tropical
morning
when
with
a
cigar
in
my
mouth
i
walked
into
the
market
what
would
sir
william
curtis
or
sir
charles
flower
have
said
could
they
have
seen
as
i
did
the
numbers
of
luxurious
turtle
lying
on
their
backs
and
displaying
their
rich
calapee
to
the
epicurean
purchaser
well
indeed
might
the
shade
of
apicius
a
lament
that
america
and
turtle
were
not
discovered
in
his
days
there
were
the
guanas
too
in
abundance
with
their
mouths
sewed
up
to
prevent
their
biting
these
are
excellent
food
although
bearing
so
near
a
resemblance
to
the
alligator
and
its
diminutive
european
representative
the
harmless
lizard
muscovy
ducks
parrots
monkeys

altogether
amply
repay
the

and
expense
of
a
voyage
to
those
who
have
leisure
or
money
enough
to
enable
them
to
visit
the
tropical
islands
the
delightful
and
indeed
indispensable
amusement
of
bathing
is
particularly
dangerous
in
these
countries
in
the
shallows
you
are
liable
to
be
struck
by
the
stingray
a
species
of
skate
with
a
sharp
barb
about
the
middle
of
its
tail
and
the
effect
of
the
wound
is
so
serious
that
i
have
known
a
person
to
be
in
a
state
of
frenzy
from
it
for
nearly
hours
in
deeper
water
the
sharks
are
not
only
numerous
but
ravenous
and
i
sometimes
gratified
their
appetites
and
my
own
love
of
excitement
by
purchasing
the
carcass
of
a
dead
cow
or
horse
this
i
towed
off
and
anchored
with
a
thick
rope
and
a
large
stone
then
from
my
boat
with
a
harpoon
i
amused
myself
in
striking
these
devils
as
they
crowded
round
for
their
meal
my
readers
will
i
fear
think
i
am
much
too
fond
of
relating
adventures
among
these
marine
undertakers
but
the
following
incident
will
not
be
found
without
interest
in
company
with
charles
one
beautiful
afternoon
rambling
over
the
rocky
cliffs
at
the
back
of
the
island
we
came
to
a
spot
where
the
stillness
and
the
clear
transparency
of
the
water
invited
us
to
bathe
it
was
not
deep
as
we
stood
above
on
the
promontory
we
could
see
the
bottom
in
every
part
under
the
little
headland
which
formed
the
opposite
side
of
the
cove
there
was
a
cavern
to
which
as
the
shore
was
steep
there
was
no
access
but
by
swimming
and
we
resolved
to
explore
it
we
soon
reached
its
mouth
and
were
enchanted
with
its
romantic
grandeur
and
wild
beauty
it
extended
we
found
a
long
way
back
and
had
several
natural
baths
into
all
of
which
we
successively
threw
ourselves
each
as
they
receded
farther
from
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
being
colder
than
the
last
the
tide
it
was
evident
had
free
ingress
and
renewed
the
water
every
twelve
hours
here
we
thoughtlessly
amused
ourselves
for
some
time
quoting
acis
and
galatea
diana
and
her
nymphs
and
every
classic
story
applicable
to
the
scene
at
length
the
declining
sun
warned
us
that
it
was
time
to
take
our
departure
from
the
cave
when
at
no
great
distance
from
us
we
saw
the
back
or
dorsal
fin
of
a
monstrous
shark
above
the
surface
of
the
water
and
his
whole
length
visible
beneath
it
we
looked
at
him
and
at
each
other
with
dismay
hoping
that
he
would
soon
take
his
departure
and
go
in
search
of
other
prey
but
the
rogue
swam
to
and
fro
just
like
a
frigate
blockading
an
enemy
port
and
we
felt
i
suppose
very
much
as
we
used
to
make
the
french
and
dutch
feel
last
war
at
brest
and
the
texel
the
sentinel
paraded
before
us
about
ten
or
fifteen
yards
in
front
of
the
cave
tack
and
tack
waiting
only
to
serve
one
if
not
both
of
us
as
we
should
have
served
a
shrimp
or
an
oyster
we
had
no
intention
however
in
this
as
in
other
instances
of
throwing
ourselves
on
the
mercy
of
the
court
in
vain
did
we
look
for
relief
from
other
quarters
the
promontory
above
us
was
inaccessible
the
tide
was
rising
and
the
sun
touching
the
clear
blue
edge
of
the
horizon
i
being
the
leader
pretended
to
a
little
knowledge
in
ichthyology
and
told
my
companion
that
fish
could
hear
as
well
as
see
and
that
therefore
the
less
we
said
the
better
and
the
sooner
we
retreated
out
of
his
sight
the
sooner
he
would
take
himself
off
this
was
our
only
chance
and
that
a
poor
one
for
the
flow
of
the
water
would
soon
have
enabled
him
to
enter
the
cave
and
help
himself
as
he
seemed
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
and
knew
that
we
had
no
mode
of
retreat
but
by
the
way
we
came
we
drew
back
out
of
sight
and
i
do
know
when
i
ever
passed
a
more
unpleasant
quarter
of
an
hour
a
suit
in
chancery
or
even
a
spring
lounge
in
newgate
would
have
been
almost
luxury
to
what
i
felt
when
the
shades
of
night
began
to
darken
the
mouth
of
our
cave
and
this
infernal
monster
continued
to
parade
like
a
before
its
door
at
last
not
seeing
the
shark
fin
above
water
i
made
a
sign
to
charles
that
qui
we
must
swim
for
it
for
we
had
notice
to
quit
by
the
tide
and
if
we
did
not
depart
should
soon
have
an
execution
in
the
house
we
had
been
careful
not
to
utter
a
word
and
silently
pressing
each
other
by
the
hand
we
slipped
into
the
water
when
recommending
ourselves
to
providence
which
for
my
part
i
seldom
forgot
when
i
was
in
imminent
danger
we
struck
out
manfully
i
must
own
i
never
felt
more
assured
of
destruction
not
even
when
i
swam
through
the
blood
of
the
poor
sailor
for
then
the
sharks
had
something
to
occupy
them
but
here
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
look
after
us
we
had
the
benefit
of
their
undivided
attention
my
sensations
were
indescribably
horrible
i
may
occasionally
write
or
talk
of
the
circumstance
with
levity
but
whenever
i
recall
it
to
mind
i
tremble
at
the
bare
recollection
of
the
dreadful
fate
that
seemed
inevitable
my
companion
was
not
so
expert
a
swimmer
as
i
was
so
that
i
distanced
him
many
feet
when
i
heard
him
utter
a
faint
cry
i
turned
round
convinced
that
the
shark
had
seized
him
but
it
was
not
so
my
having
left
him
so
far
behind
had
increased
his
terror
and
induced
him
to
draw
my
attention
i
returned
to
him
held
him
up
and
encouraged
him
without
this
he
would
certainly
have
sunk
he
revived
with
my
help
and
we
reached
the
sandy
beach
in
safety
having
eluded
our
enemy
who
when
he
neither
saw
or
heard
us
had
as
i
concluded
he
would
quitted
the
spot
once
more
on
terra
firma
we
lay
gasping
for
some
minutes
before
we
spoke
what
my
companion
thoughts
were
i
do
not
know
mine
were
replete
with
gratitude
to
god
and
renewed
vows
of
amendment
and
i
have
every
reason
to
think
that
although
charles
had
not
so
much
room
for
reform
as
myself
his
feelings
were
perfectly
in
unison
with
my
own
we
never
afterwards
repeated
this
amusement
though
we
frequently
talked
of
our
escape
and
laughed
at
our
terrors
yet
on
these
occasions
our
conversation
always
took
a
serious
turn
and
upon
the
whole
i
am
convinced
that
this
adventure
did
us
both
a
vast
deal
of
good
i
had
now
been
six
months
in
these
islands
had
perfectly
recovered
my
health
and
became
anxious
for
active
employment
the
brilliant
successes
of
our
at
washington
made
me
wish
for
a
share
of
the
honour
and
glory
which
my
brethren
in
arms
were
acquiring
on
the
coast
of
north
america
but
my
wayward
fate
sent
me
in
a
very
opposite
direction
chapter
xix
how
came
we
ashore
by
providence
divine
sit
still
and
hear
the
last
of
our
here
in
this
island
we
arrived
a
frigate
called
at
the
island
for
turtle
and
having
represented
my
case
to
the
captain
he
offered
to
take
me
on
board
telling
me
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
going
much
farther
to
the
southward
to
relieve
another
cruiser
who
would
then
return
to
england
and
the
captain
of
her
would
no
doubt
give
me
a
passage
home
i
accordingly
made
hasty
preparations
for
my
departure
took
leave
of
all
my
kind
friends
at
the
barracks
for
kind
indeed
they
were
to
although
thoughtless
and
foolish
towards
themselves
i
bade
adieu
to
the
families
on
the
island
in
whose
houses
and
at
whose
tables
i
had
experienced
the
most
liberal
hospitality
and
last
though
not
least
i
took
leave
of
poor
carlotta
this
was
a
difficult
task
to
perform
but
it
was
imperative
i
told
her
that
i
was
ordered
on
board
by
my
captain
who
being
a
very
different
person
from
the
last
i
dare
not
disobey
i
promised
to
return
to
her
soon
i
offered
her
money
and
presents
but
she
would
accept
of
nothing
but
a
small
locket
to
wear
for
my
sake
i
purchased
the
freedom
of
poor
sophy
the
black
girl
who
had
saved
my
life
the
little
creature
wept
bitterly
at
my
coming
away
but
i
could
do
no
more
for
her
as
for
carlotta
i
learned
afterwards
that
she
went
on
board
every
ship
that
arrived
to
gain
intelligence
of
me
who
seldom
or
ever
gave
her
a
thought
we
sailed
and
steering
away
to
the
with
moderate
winds
and
fine
weather
captured
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
large
american
ship
which
had
made
a
devious
course
from
the
french
coast
in
hopes
of
avoiding
our
cruisers
she
was
about
four
hundred
tons
deeply
laden
and
bound
to
laguira
with
a
valuable
cargo
the
captain
sent
for
me
and
told
me
that
if
i
chose
to
take
charge
of
her
as
prize
master
i
might
proceed
to
england
direct
this
plan
exactly
suited
me
and
i
consented
only
begging
to
have
a
boatswain
mate
named
thompson
to
go
along
with
me
he
was
an
old
shipmate
and
had
been
one
of
my
gig
crew
when
we
had
the
affair
in
basque
roads
he
was
a
steady
resolute
quiet
sober
caledonian
from
aberdeen
and
a
man
that
i
knew
would
stand
by
me
in
the
hour
of
need
he
was
ordered
to
go
with
me
and
the
necessary
supply
of
provisions
and
spirits
were
put
on
board
i
received
my
orders
and
took
my
leave
of
my
new
captain
who
was
both
a
good
seaman
and
an
excellent
officer
when
i
got
on
board
the
prize
i
found
all
the
prisoners
busy
packing
up
their
things
and
they
became
exceedingly
alert
in
placing
them
in
the
boat
which
was
to
convey
them
on
board
the
frigate
indeed
they
all
crowded
into
her
with
an
unusual
degree
of
activity
but
this
did
not
particularly
strike
my
attention
at
the
time
my
directions
were
to
retain
the
captain
and
one
man
with
me
in
order
to
condemn
the
vessel
in
the
court
of
admiralty
occupied
with
many
objects
at
once
all
important
to
me
as
i
was
so
soon
to
part
company
with
the
frigate
i
did
not
recollect
this
part
of
my
orders
and
that
i
was
detaining
the
boat
until
the
young
midshipman
who
had
charge
of
her
asked
me
if
he
might
return
on
board
and
take
the
prisoners
i
then
went
on
deck
and
seeing
the
whole
of
them
with
their
chests
and
bags
seated
very
quietly
in
the
boat
and
ready
to
shove
off
i
desired
the
captain
and
one
of
the
american
seamen
to
come
on
board
again
and
to
bring
their
clothes
with
them
i
did
not
remark
the
unwillingness
of
the
captain
to
obey
this
order
until
told
of
it
by
the
midshipman
his
chest
and
goods
were
immediately
handed
in
upon
deck
and
the
signal
from
the
frigate
being
repeated
with
a
light
for
the
boat
to
return
for
it
was
now
dark
she
shoved
off
hastily
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
stop
the
boat
for
god
sake
stop
the
boat
cried
the
captain
why
should
i
stop
the
boat
said
i
my
orders
are
positive
and
you
must
remain
with
me
i
then
went
below
for
a
minute
or
two
and
the
captain
followed
me
as
you
value
your
life
sir
said
he
stop
the
boat
why
asked
i
eagerly
because
sir
said
he
the
ship
has
been
scuttled
by
the
men
and
will
sink
in
a
few
hours
you
can
not
save
her
for
you
can
not
get
at
her
leaks
i
now
did
indeed
see
the
necessity
of
stopping
the
boat
but
it
was
too
late
she
was
out
of
sight
the
lanthorn
the
signal
for
her
return
had
been
hauled
down
a
proof
that
she
had
got
on
board
i
hoisted
two
lights
at
the
mizen
peak
and
ordered
a
musket
to
be
fired
but
unfortunately
the
cartridges
had
either
not
been
put
in
the
boat
which
brought
me
or
they
had
been
taken
back
in
her
one
of
my
lights
went
out
the
other
was
not
seen
by
the
frigate
we
hoisted
another
light
but
it
gained
no
notice
the
ship
had
evidently
made
sail
i
stood
after
her
as
fast
as
i
could
in
hopes
of
her
seeing
us
that
night
or
taking
us
out
the
next
morning
should
we
be
afloat
but
my
vessel
deeply
laden
was
already
getting
waterlogged
and
would
not
sail
on
a
wind
more
than
four
miles
an
hour
all
hope
in
that
quarter
vanished
i
then
endeavoured
to
discover
from
the
captain
where
the
leaks
were
that
we
might
stop
them
but
he
had
been
drinking
so
freely
that
i
could
get
nothing
from
him
but
dutch
courage
and
braggadocia
the
poor
black
man
who
had
been
left
with
the
captain
was
next
consulted
all
he
knew
was
that
when
at
bordeaux
the
captain
had
caused
holes
to
be
bored
in
the
bottom
that
he
might
pull
the
plugs
out
whenever
he
liked
swearing
at
the
same
time
that
she
never
should
enter
a
british
port
he
did
not
know
where
the
leaks
were
situated
though
it
was
evident
to
me
that
they
were
in
the
after
and
also
in
the
fore
parts
of
the
ship
low
down
and
now
deep
under
water
both
inside
as
well
as
out
the
black
man
added
that
the
captain
had
let
the
water
in
and
that
was
all
he
knew
i
again
spoke
to
the
captain
but
he
was
too
far
gone
to
reason
with
he
had
got
drunk
to
die
because
he
was
afraid
to
die
sober
no
unusual
case
with
sailors
do
tell
me
d
n
me
who
is
to
die
i
ar
i
swore
she
should
never
enter
a
british
port
and
i
have
kept
my
word
he
then
began
to
use
curses
and
execrations
and
at
last
fell
on
the
deck
in
a
fit
of
drunken
frenzy
i
now
called
my
people
all
together
and
having
stated
to
them
the
peril
of
our
situation
we
agreed
that
a
large
boat
which
lay
on
the
booms
should
be
instantly
hoisted
out
and
stowed
with
every
thing
necessary
for
a
voyage
our
clothes
bread
salt
meat
and
water
were
put
into
her
with
my
sextant
and
the
liquor
which
was
in
the
cabin
i
gave
in
charge
to
the
midshipman
who
was
sent
with
me
and
having
completely
stowed
our
boat
and
prepared
her
with
a
good
we
made
her
fast
with
a
couple
of
stout
and
veered
her
astern
with
four
men
in
her
keeping
on
our
course
in
the
supposed
track
of
the
frigate
till
daylight
that
hour
arrived
but
no
frigate
was
to
be
seen
even
from
the
the
ship
was
getting
deeper
and
deeper
and
we
prepared
to
take
to
the
boat
i
calculated
the
nearest
part
of
south
america
to
be
seven
hundred
miles
from
us
and
that
we
were
more
than
twice
that
distance
from
rio
janeiro
i
did
not
however
despond
for
under
all
circumstances
we
were
extremely
well
off
and
i
inspired
the
men
with
so
much
confidence
that
they
obeyed
in
everything
with
the
utmost
alacrity
and
cheerfulness
except
in
one
single
point
finding
the
ship
could
not
in
all
probability
float
more
than
an
hour
or
two
i
determined
to
quit
her
and
ordered
the
boat
alongside
the
men
got
into
her
stepped
the
mast
hooked
on
the
ready
to
hoist
at
my
orders
and
without
my
bidding
had
spread
my
boat
cloak
in
the
and
made
a
comfortable
place
for
me
to
repose
in
the
master
proceeded
to
get
into
the
boat
but
the
men
repulsed
him
with
kicks
blows
and
hisses
swearing
most
dreadfully
that
if
he
attempted
to
come
in
they
would
throw
him
overboard
although
in
some
measure
i
participated
in
their
angry
feeling
yet
i
could
not
reconcile
myself
to
leave
a
thus
to
perish
even
in
the
pit
which
he
had
dug
for
others
and
this
too
at
a
time
when
we
needed
every
indulgence
from
the
almighty
for
ourselves
and
every
assistance
from
his
hand
to
conduct
us
into
a
port
he
deserves
to
die
it
is
all
his
own
doings
said
they
come
into
the
boat
yourself
sir
or
we
must
shove
off
without
you
the
poor
captain
who
after
sleeping
four
hours
had
recovered
his
senses
and
felt
all
the
horror
of
his
situation
wept
screamed
tore
his
hair
laid
hold
of
my
coat
from
which
only
the
strength
of
my
men
could
disengage
him
he
clung
to
life
with
a
passion
of
feeling
which
i
never
saw
in
a
criminal
condemned
by
the
law
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
me
as
he
appealed
to
us
all
collectively
and
separately
he
reminded
us
of
his
wife
and
starving
children
at
baltimore
and
he
implored
us
to
think
of
them
and
of
our
own
i
was
melted
to
tears
i
confess
but
my
men
heard
him
with
the
most
stoical
unconcern
two
of
them
threw
him
over
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
deck
and
before
he
could
recover
from
the
violence
of
the
fall
pushed
me
into
the
boat
and
shoved
off
the
wretched
man
had
by
this
time
crawled
over
to
the
side
we
had
just
left
and
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
again
screamed
out
oh
mercy
mercy
mercy
for
sake
have
mercy
if
you
expect
any
oh
god
my
wife
and
babes
his
prayers
i
lament
to
say
had
no
effect
on
the
exasperated
seamen
he
then
fell
into
a
fit
of
cursing
and
blasphemy
evidently
bereft
of
his
senses
and
in
this
state
he
continued
for
some
minutes
while
we
lay
alongside
the
bowman
holding
on
with
the
only
i
was
secretly
determined
not
to
leave
him
although
i
foresaw
a
mutiny
in
the
boat
in
consequence
at
length
i
gave
the
order
to
shove
off
the
unhappy
captain
who
till
that
moment
might
have
entertained
some
faint
hope
from
the
lurking
compassion
which
he
perceived
i
felt
for
him
now
resigned
himself
to
despair
of
a
more
sullen
and
horrible
aspect
he
sat
himself
down
on
one
of
the
and
gazed
on
us
with
a
ghastly
eye
i
can
not
remember
ever
seeing
a
more
shocking
picture
of
human
misery
while
i
looked
at
him
the
black
man
mungo
who
belonged
to
the
ship
sprang
overboard
from
the
boat
and
swam
back
to
the
wreck
seizing
a
rope
which
hung
from
the
gangway
he
ascended
the
side
and
joined
his
master
we
called
to
him
to
come
back
or
we
should
leave
him
behind
no
massa
replied
the
faithful
creature
me
no
want
to
lib
no
takee
massa
green
no
takee
me
mungo
lib
good
many
years
wi
massa
cappen
mungo
die
wi
massa
and
go
back
to
guinea
i
now
thought
we
had
given
the
captain
a
sufficient
lesson
for
his
treachery
and
murderous
intentions
had
i
indeed
ever
seriously
intended
to
leave
him
the
conduct
of
poor
mungo
would
have
awakened
me
to
a
sense
of
my
duty
i
ordered
thompson
who
was
steering
the
boat
to
put
the
helm
and
lay
her
alongside
again
no
sooner
was
this
command
given
than
three
or
four
of
the
men
jumped
up
in
a
menacing
attitude
and
swore
that
they
would
not
go
back
for
him
that
he
was
the
cause
of
all
their
sufferings
and
that
if
i
chose
to
share
his
fate
i
might
but
into
the
boat
he
should
not
come
one
of
them
more
daring
than
the
rest
attempted
to
take
the
tiller
out
of
thompson
hand
but
the
trusty
seaman
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
in
an
instant
threw
him
overboard
the
other
men
were
coming
aft
to
avenge
this
treatment
of
their
leader
but
i
drew
my
sword
and
pointing
it
at
the
breast
of
the
nearest
mutineer
desired
him
on
pain
of
instant
death
to
return
to
his
seat
he
had
heard
my
character
and
knew
that
i
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
a
mutineer
is
easily
subdued
with
common
firmness
he
obeyed
but
was
very
sullen
and
i
heard
many
mutinous
expressions
among
the
men
one
of
them
said
that
i
was
not
their
officer
that
i
did
not
belong
to
the
frigate
that
i
replied
is
a
case
of
which
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
be
the
judges
i
hold
in
my
pocket
a
commission
from
the
king
lord
high
admiral
or
the
commissioners
for
executing
that
duty
your
captain
and
mine
also
holds
a
similar
commission
under
this
authority
i
act
let
me
see
the
man
that
dares
dispute
it
i
will
hang
him
at
the
of
the
wreck
before
she
goes
down
and
looking
at
the
man
whom
thompson
had
thrown
overboard
and
who
still
held
by
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
without
daring
to
get
in
i
asked
him
if
he
would
obey
me
or
not
he
replied
that
he
would
and
hoped
i
would
forgive
him
i
said
that
my
forgiveness
would
depend
entirely
on
the
conduct
of
himself
and
the
others
that
he
must
recollect
that
if
our
own
ship
or
any
other
picked
us
up
he
was
liable
with
three
or
four
more
to
be
hanged
for
mutiny
and
that
nothing
but
his
and
their
future
obedience
could
save
them
from
that
punishment
whenever
we
reached
a
port
this
harangue
had
a
very
tranquillising
effect
the
offenders
all
begged
pardon
and
assured
me
they
would
deserve
my
forgiveness
by
their
future
submission
all
this
passed
at
some
little
distance
from
the
wreck
but
within
hearing
and
while
it
was
going
on
the
wind
which
had
been
fair
when
we
put
off
gradually
died
away
and
blew
faintly
from
the
directly
towards
the
sinking
wreck
i
took
advantage
of
this
circumstance
to
read
them
a
lecture
when
i
had
subdued
them
and
worked
a
little
on
their
feelings
i
said
i
never
knew
any
good
come
of
cruelty
whenever
a
ship
or
a
boat
had
left
a
man
behind
who
might
have
been
saved
that
disaster
or
destruction
had
invariably
attended
those
who
had
so
cruelly
acted
that
i
was
quite
sure
we
never
should
escape
from
this
danger
if
we
did
not
show
mercy
to
our
god
said
i
has
shown
mercy
to
us
in
giving
us
this
excellent
boat
to
save
us
in
our
imminent
danger
and
he
seems
to
say
to
us
now
back
to
the
wreck
and
rescue
your
the
wind
blows
directly
towards
her
and
is
foul
for
the
point
in
which
we
intend
to
steer
hasten
then
pursued
i
obey
the
divine
will
do
your
duty
and
trust
in
god
i
shall
then
be
proud
to
command
you
and
have
no
doubt
of
bringing
you
safe
into
port
this
was
the
pliant
hour
they
sprang
upon
their
oars
and
pulled
back
to
the
wreck
with
alacrity
the
poor
captain
who
had
witnessed
all
that
passed
watched
the
progress
of
his
cause
with
deep
anxiety
no
sooner
did
the
boat
touch
the
ship
than
he
leaped
into
her
fell
down
on
his
knees
and
thanked
god
aloud
for
his
deliverance
he
then
fell
on
my
neck
embraced
me
kissed
my
cheek
and
wept
like
a
girl
the
sailors
meanwhile
who
never
bear
malice
long
jumped
up
and
assisted
him
in
getting
his
little
articles
into
the
boat
and
as
mungo
followed
his
master
shook
hands
with
him
all
round
and
swore
he
should
be
a
black
prince
when
he
went
back
to
guinea
we
also
took
in
one
or
two
more
little
articles
of
general
use
which
had
been
forgotten
in
our
former
hurry
we
now
shoved
off
for
the
last
time
and
had
not
proceeded
more
than
two
hundred
yards
from
the
ship
when
she
gave
a
heavy
lurch
on
one
side
recovered
it
and
rolled
as
deep
on
the
other
then
as
if
endued
with
life
and
instinct
gave
a
pitch
and
went
down
head
foremost
into
the
fathomless
deep
we
had
scarcely
time
to
behold
this
awful
scene
when
the
wind
again
sprang
up
fair
from
its
old
quarter
the
east
there
said
i
heaven
has
declared
itself
in
your
favour
already
you
have
got
your
fair
wind
again
we
thanked
god
for
this
and
having
set
our
sail
i
shaped
my
course
for
cape
st
thomas
and
we
went
to
our
frugal
dinner
with
cheerful
and
grateful
hearts
the
weather
was
fine
the
sea
tolerably
smooth
and
as
we
had
plenty
of
provisions
and
water
we
did
not
suffer
much
except
from
an
apprehension
of
a
change
of
wind
and
the
knowledge
of
our
precarious
situation
on
the
fifth
day
after
leaving
the
wreck
we
discovered
land
at
a
great
distance
i
knew
it
to
be
the
island
of
trinidad
and
the
rocks
of
martin
vas
this
island
which
lies
in
latitude
twenty
degrees
south
and
longitude
thirty
degrees
west
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
island
of
the
same
name
on
the
coast
of
terra
firma
in
the
west
indies
and
now
a
british
colony
on
consulting
horseberg
which
i
had
in
the
boat
i
found
that
the
island
which
we
were
now
approaching
was
formerly
inhabited
by
the
portuguese
but
long
since
abandoned
i
continued
steering
towards
it
during
the
night
until
we
heard
the
breakers
roaring
against
the
rocks
when
i
to
windward
of
the
land
till
daylight
the
morning
presented
to
our
view
a
precipitous
and
rugged
coast
with
high
and
pointed
rocks
frowning
defiance
over
the
unappeaseable
and
furious
waves
which
broke
incessantly
at
their
feet
and
recoiled
to
repeat
the
blow
thus
for
ages
had
they
been
employed
and
thus
for
ages
will
they
continue
without
making
any
impression
visible
to
the
eye
of
man
to
land
was
impossible
on
the
part
of
the
coast
now
under
our
inspection
and
we
coasted
along
in
hopes
of
finding
some
haven
into
which
we
might
haul
our
boat
and
secure
her
the
island
appeared
to
be
about
nine
miles
long
evidently
of
volcanic
formation
an
assemblage
of
rocky
mountains
towering
several
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
it
was
barren
except
at
the
summit
of
the
hills
where
some
trees
formed
a
coronet
at
once
beautiful
and
refreshing
but
tantalising
to
look
at
as
they
appeared
utterly
inaccessible
and
even
supposing
i
could
have
discovered
a
i
was
in
great
doubt
whether
i
should
have
availed
myself
of
it
as
the
island
appeared
to
produce
nothing
which
could
have
added
to
our
comfort
while
delay
would
only
have
uselessly
consumed
our
provisions
there
did
not
appear
to
be
a
living
creature
on
the
island
and
the
danger
of
approaching
to
find
a
was
most
imminent
this
unpromising
appearance
induced
me
to
propose
that
we
should
continue
our
course
to
rio
janeiro
the
men
were
of
another
opinion
they
said
they
had
been
too
long
afloat
cooped
up
and
that
they
should
prefer
remaining
on
the
island
to
risking
their
lives
any
longer
in
so
frail
a
boat
on
the
wide
ocean
we
were
still
debating
when
we
came
to
a
small
spot
of
sand
on
which
we
discovered
two
wild
hogs
which
we
conjectured
had
come
down
to
feed
on
the
shell
fish
this
decided
them
and
i
consented
to
run
to
leeward
of
the
island
and
seek
for
a
we
sounded
the
west
end
following
the
remarks
of
horseberg
and
ran
for
the
cove
of
the
rock
as
we
opened
it
a
scene
of
grandeur
presented
itself
which
we
had
never
met
with
before
and
which
in
its
kind
is
probably
unrivalled
in
nature
an
enormous
rock
rose
nearly
perpendicularly
out
of
the
sea
to
the
height
of
nine
hundred
or
one
thousand
feet
it
was
as
narrow
at
the
base
as
it
was
at
the
top
and
was
formed
exactly
in
the
shape
of
the
from
which
it
derives
its
name
the
sides
appeared
smooth
and
even
to
the
top
which
was
covered
with
verdure
and
was
so
far
above
us
that
the
sea
birds
which
in
myriads
screamed
around
it
were
scarcely
visible
of
the
way
up
the
sea
beat
violently
against
its
base
the
feathered
tribe
in
endless
variety
had
been
for
ages
the
undisturbed
tenants
of
this
natural
monument
all
its
jutting
points
and
little
projections
were
covered
with
their
white
dung
and
it
seemed
to
me
a
wonderful
effort
of
nature
which
had
placed
this
mass
in
the
position
which
it
held
in
spite
of
the
utmost
efforts
of
the
winds
and
waves
of
the
wide
ocean
another
curious
phenomenon
appeared
at
the
other
end
of
the
cove
the
lava
had
poured
down
into
the
sea
and
formed
a
stratum
a
second
river
of
fused
rock
had
poured
again
over
the
first
and
had
cooled
so
rapidly
as
to
hang
suspended
not
having
joined
the
former
strata
but
leaving
a
vacuum
between
for
the
water
to
fill
up
the
sea
dashed
violently
between
the
two
beds
and
spouted
magnificently
through
holes
in
the
upper
bed
of
lava
to
the
height
of
sixty
feet
resembling
much
the
spouting
of
a
whale
but
with
a
noise
and
force
infinitely
greater
the
sound
indeed
was
tremendous
hollow
and
awful
i
could
not
help
mentally
adoring
the
works
of
the
creator
and
my
heart
sunk
within
me
at
my
own
insignificance
folly
and
wickedness
as
we
were
now
running
along
the
shore
looking
for
our
and
just
going
to
take
in
the
sail
the
american
captain
who
sat
close
to
the
man
at
the
helm
seemed
attentively
watching
something
on
the
larboard
bow
of
the
boat
in
an
instant
he
exclaimed
put
your
helm
my
good
fellow
these
words
he
accompanied
with
a
push
of
the
helm
so
violent
as
almost
to
throw
the
man
overboard
who
sat
on
the
larboard
quarter
at
the
same
moment
a
heavy
sea
lifted
the
boat
and
sent
her
many
yards
beyond
and
to
the
right
of
a
pointed
rock
just
flush
or
even
with
the
water
which
had
escaped
our
notice
and
which
none
suspected
but
the
american
captain
for
these
rocks
do
not
show
breakers
every
minute
if
they
did
they
would
be
easily
avoided
on
this
we
should
most
certainly
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
had
not
the
danger
been
seen
and
avoided
by
the
sudden
and
skilful
motion
of
the
helm
one
moment
more
and
one
foot
nearer
and
we
were
gone
merciful
god
said
i
to
what
fate
am
i
reserved
at
last
how
can
i
be
sufficiently
thankful
for
so
much
goodness
i
thanked
the
american
for
his
attention
told
my
men
how
much
we
were
indebted
to
him
and
how
amply
he
had
repaid
our
kindness
in
taking
him
off
the
wreck
ah
lieutenant
said
the
poor
man
it
is
a
small
turn
i
done
you
for
the
kindness
you
have
shown
to
me
the
water
was
very
deep
the
rocks
being
steep
so
we
lowered
our
sail
and
getting
our
oars
out
pulled
in
to
look
for
a
landing
at
the
farther
end
of
the
cove
we
discovered
the
wreck
of
a
vessel
lying
on
the
beach
she
was
broken
in
two
and
appeared
to
be
this
increased
the
eagerness
of
the
men
to
land
we
rowed
close
to
the
shore
but
found
that
the
boat
would
be
dashed
to
pieces
if
we
attempted
it
the
midshipman
proposed
that
one
of
us
should
swim
on
shore
and
by
ascending
a
hill
discover
a
place
to
lay
the
boat
in
this
i
agreed
to
and
the
immediately
threw
off
his
clothes
i
made
a
fast
to
him
under
his
arms
that
we
might
pull
him
in
if
we
found
him
exhausted
he
went
over
the
surf
with
great
ease
until
he
came
to
the
breakers
on
the
beach
through
which
he
could
not
force
his
way
for
the
moment
he
touched
the
ground
with
his
foot
the
recoil
of
the
sea
and
what
is
called
by
sailors
the
undertow
carried
him
back
again
and
left
him
in
the
rear
of
the
last
wave
three
times
the
brave
fellow
made
the
attempt
and
with
the
same
result
at
last
he
sunk
and
we
pulled
him
in
very
nearly
dead
we
however
restored
him
by
care
and
attention
and
he
went
again
to
his
usual
duty
the
midshipman
now
proposed
that
he
should
try
to
swim
through
the
surf
without
the
line
for
that
alone
had
impeded
the
progress
of
the
this
was
true
but
i
would
not
allow
him
to
run
the
risk
and
we
pulled
along
shore
until
we
came
to
a
rock
on
which
the
surf
beat
very
high
and
which
we
avoided
in
consequence
this
rock
we
discovered
to
be
detached
from
the
main
and
within
it
to
our
great
joy
we
saw
smooth
water
we
pulled
in
and
succeeded
in
landing
without
much
difficulty
and
having
secured
our
boat
to
a
grapnel
and
left
two
trusty
men
in
charge
of
her
i
proceeded
with
the
rest
to
explore
the
cove
our
attention
was
naturally
first
directed
to
the
wreck
which
we
had
passed
in
the
boat
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
scrambling
over
huge
fragments
of
broken
rocks
which
had
been
detached
from
the
sides
of
the
hill
and
encumbered
the
beach
we
arrived
at
the
spot
the
wreck
proved
to
be
a
beautiful
schooner
of
about
a
hundred
and
eighty
tons
burthen
she
had
been
dashed
on
shore
with
great
violence
and
thrown
many
yards
above
the
mark
her
masts
and
spars
were
lying
in
all
directions
on
the
beach
which
was
strewed
with
her
cargo
this
consisted
of
a
variety
of
toys
and
hardware
musical
instruments
violins
flutes
fifes
and
some
few
remains
of
books
which
i
picked
up
were
french
romances
with
indelicate
plates
and
still
worse
text
these
proved
the
vessel
to
be
french
at
a
short
distance
from
the
wreck
on
a
rising
knoll
we
found
three
or
four
huts
rudely
constructed
out
of
the
fragments
and
a
little
farther
off
a
succession
of
graves
each
surmounted
with
a
cross
i
examined
the
huts
which
contained
some
rude
and
simple
relics
of
human
tenancy
a
few
benches
and
tables
composed
of
boards
roughly
hewn
out
and
nailed
together
bones
of
goats
and
of
the
wild
hog
with
the
remains
of
burnt
wood
but
we
could
not
discover
any
traces
of
the
name
of
the
vessel
or
owner
nor
were
there
any
names
marked
or
cut
on
the
boards
as
might
have
been
expected
to
show
to
whom
the
vessel
belonged
and
what
had
become
of
the
survivors
this
studied
concealment
of
all
information
led
us
to
the
most
accurate
knowledge
of
her
port
of
departure
her
destination
and
her
object
of
trade
being
on
the
side
of
the
island
with
her
head
lying
to
the
she
had
beyond
all
doubt
been
running
from
rio
janeiro
towards
the
coast
of
africa
and
got
on
shore
in
the
night
that
she
was
going
to
fetch
a
cargo
of
slaves
was
equally
clear
not
only
from
the
baubles
with
which
she
was
freighted
but
also
from
the
interior
fitting
of
the
vessel
and
from
a
number
of
hand
and
leg
shackles
which
we
found
among
the
wreck
and
which
we
knew
were
only
used
for
the
purposes
of
confining
and
securing
the
unhappy
victims
of
this
traffic
we
took
up
our
quarters
in
the
huts
for
the
night
and
the
next
morning
divided
ourselves
into
three
parties
to
explore
the
island
i
have
before
observed
that
we
had
muskets
but
no
powder
and
therefore
stood
little
chance
of
killing
any
of
the
goats
or
wild
hogs
with
which
we
found
the
island
abounded
one
party
sought
the
means
of
attaining
the
highest
summit
of
the
island
another
went
along
the
shore
to
the
westward
while
myself
and
two
others
went
to
the
eastward
we
crossed
several
ravines
with
much
difficulty
until
we
reached
a
long
valley
which
seemed
to
intersect
the
island
here
a
wonderful
and
most
melancholy
phenomenon
arrested
our
attention
thousands
and
thousands
of
trees
covered
the
valley
each
of
them
about
thirty
feet
high
but
every
tree
was
dead
and
extended
its
leafless
boughs
to
another
a
forest
of
desolation
as
if
nature
had
at
some
particular
moment
ceased
to
vegetate
there
was
no
underwood
or
grass
on
the
lowest
of
the
dead
boughs
the
gannets
and
other
sea
birds
had
built
their
nests
in
numbers
unaccountable
their
tameness
as
cooper
says
was
shocking
to
me
so
unaccustomed
did
they
seem
to
man
that
the
mothers
brooding
over
their
young
only
opened
their
beaks
in
a
menacing
attitude
at
us
as
we
passed
by
them
how
to
account
satisfactorily
for
the
simultaneous
destruction
of
this
vast
forest
of
trees
was
very
difficult
there
was
no
want
of
rich
earth
for
nourishment
of
the
roots
the
most
probable
cause
appeared
to
me
a
sudden
and
continued
eruption
of
sulphuric
effluvia
from
the
volcano
or
else
by
some
unusually
heavy
gale
of
wind
or
hurricane
the
trees
had
been
drenched
with
salt
water
to
their
roots
one
or
the
other
of
these
causes
must
have
produced
the
effect
the
philosopher
or
the
geologist
must
decide
we
had
the
consolation
to
know
that
we
should
at
least
experience
no
want
of
food
the
nests
of
the
birds
affording
us
a
plentiful
supply
of
eggs
and
young
ones
of
every
age
with
these
we
returned
loaded
to
the
cove
the
party
that
had
gone
to
the
westward
reported
having
seen
some
wild
hogs
but
were
unable
to
secure
any
of
them
and
those
who
had
attempted
to
ascend
the
mountain
returned
much
fatigued
and
one
of
their
number
missing
they
reported
that
they
had
gained
the
summit
of
the
mountain
where
they
had
discovered
a
large
plain
skirted
by
a
species
of
fern
tree
from
twelve
to
eighteen
feet
high
that
on
this
plain
they
had
seen
a
herd
of
goats
and
among
them
could
distinguish
one
of
enormous
size
which
appeared
to
be
their
leader
he
was
as
large
as
a
pony
but
all
attempts
to
take
one
of
them
were
utterly
fruitless
the
man
who
was
missing
had
followed
them
farther
than
they
had
they
waited
some
time
for
his
return
but
as
he
did
not
come
to
them
they
concluded
he
had
taken
some
other
route
to
the
cove
i
did
not
quite
like
this
story
fearing
some
dreadful
accident
had
befallen
the
poor
fellow
for
whom
we
kept
a
watch
and
had
a
fire
burning
the
whole
night
which
like
the
former
one
we
passed
in
the
huts
we
had
an
abundant
supply
of
from
the
wreck
and
a
stream
of
clear
water
ran
close
by
our
little
village
the
next
morning
a
party
was
sent
in
search
of
the
man
and
some
were
sent
to
fetch
a
supply
of
young
gannets
for
our
dinner
the
latter
brought
back
with
them
as
many
young
birds
as
would
suffice
for
two
or
three
days
but
of
the
three
who
went
in
quest
of
the
missing
man
only
two
returned
they
reported
that
they
could
gain
no
tidings
of
him
that
they
had
missed
one
of
their
own
number
who
had
no
doubt
gone
in
pursuit
of
his
shipmate
this
intelligence
occasioned
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
and
many
surmises
the
most
prevalent
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
there
were
wild
beasts
on
the
island
and
that
our
poor
friends
had
become
a
prey
to
them
i
determined
the
next
morning
to
go
in
search
of
them
myself
taking
one
or
two
chosen
men
with
me
i
should
have
mentioned
that
when
we
left
the
sinking
vessel
we
had
taken
out
a
poodle
dog
that
was
on
board
first
because
i
would
not
allow
the
poor
animal
to
perish
and
secondly
because
we
might
if
we
had
no
better
food
make
a
dinner
of
him
this
was
quite
fair
as
charity
begins
at
home
this
faithful
animal
became
much
attached
to
me
from
whom
he
invariably
received
his
portion
of
food
he
never
quitted
me
nor
followed
any
one
else
and
he
was
my
companion
when
i
went
on
this
excursion
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
first
mountain
whence
we
saw
the
goats
browsing
on
the
second
and
meant
to
go
there
in
pursuit
of
the
objects
of
our
anxious
search
i
was
some
yards
in
advance
of
my
companions
and
the
dog
a
little
distance
before
me
near
the
shelving
part
of
a
rock
terminating
in
a
precipice
the
shelf
i
had
to
cross
was
about
six
or
seven
feet
wide
and
ten
or
twelve
long
with
a
very
little
inclined
plane
towards
the
precipice
so
that
i
thought
it
perfectly
safe
a
small
rill
of
water
trickled
down
from
the
rock
above
it
and
losing
itself
among
the
moss
and
grass
fell
over
the
precipice
below
which
indeed
was
of
a
frightful
depth
this
causeway
was
to
all
appearance
safe
compared
with
many
which
we
had
passed
and
i
was
just
going
to
step
upon
it
when
my
dog
ran
before
me
jumped
on
the
fatal
pass
his
feet
slipped
from
under
him
he
fell
and
disappeared
over
the
precipice
i
started
back
i
heard
a
heavy
squelch
and
a
howl
another
fainter
succeeded
and
all
was
still
i
advanced
with
the
utmost
caution
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
where
i
discovered
that
the
rill
of
water
had
nourished
a
short
moss
close
and
smooth
as
velvet
and
so
slippery
as
not
to
admit
of
the
lightest
footstep
this
accounted
for
the
sudden
disappearance
and
as
i
concluded
the
inevitable
death
of
my
dog
my
first
thoughts
were
those
of
gratitude
for
my
miraculous
escape
my
second
unwillingly
glanced
at
the
fate
of
my
poor
men
too
probably
lying
lifeless
at
the
foot
of
this
mountain
i
stated
my
fears
to
the
two
seamen
who
were
with
me
and
who
had
just
come
up
the
whole
bore
too
much
the
appearance
of
truth
to
admit
of
a
doubt
we
descended
the
ruins
by
a
circuitous
and
winding
way
and
after
an
hour
difficult
and
dangerous
walk
we
reached
the
spot
where
all
our
fears
were
too
fully
confirmed
there
lay
the
two
dead
bodies
of
our
companions
and
that
of
my
dog
all
mangled
in
a
shocking
manner
both
it
would
appear
had
attempted
to
cross
the
shelf
in
the
same
careless
way
which
i
was
about
to
do
when
providence
interposed
the
dog
in
my
behalf
this
singular
dispensation
was
not
lost
upon
me
indeed
latterly
i
had
been
in
such
perils
and
seen
such
escapes
that
i
became
quite
an
altered
and
reflecting
character
i
returned
to
my
men
at
the
cove
thoughtful
and
melancholy
i
told
them
of
what
had
happened
and
having
a
with
me
in
my
trunk
i
proposed
to
them
that
i
should
read
the
evening
prayers
and
a
thanksgiving
for
our
deliverance
in
this
the
american
captain
whose
name
was
green
most
heartily
concurred
indeed
ever
since
this
poor
man
had
been
received
into
the
boat
he
had
been
a
very
different
character
to
what
i
had
at
first
supposed
him
he
constantly
refused
his
allowance
of
spirits
giving
it
among
the
sailors
he
was
silent
and
meditative
i
often
found
him
in
prayer
and
on
these
occasions
i
never
interrupted
him
at
other
times
he
studied
how
he
might
make
himself
most
useful
he
would
patch
and
mend
the
people
clothes
and
shoes
or
show
them
how
to
do
it
for
themselves
whenever
any
hard
work
was
to
be
done
he
was
always
the
first
to
begin
and
the
last
to
leave
off
and
to
such
a
degree
did
he
carry
his
attention
and
kindness
that
we
all
began
to
love
him
and
to
treat
him
with
great
respect
he
took
charge
of
a
watch
when
we
were
at
sea
and
never
closed
his
eyes
during
his
hour
of
duty
nor
was
this
the
effect
of
fear
or
the
dread
of
among
so
many
englishmen
whom
his
errors
had
led
into
so
much
misfortune
he
very
soon
had
an
opportunity
of
proving
that
his
altered
conduct
was
the
effect
of
sorrow
and
repentance
the
next
morning
i
sent
a
party
round
by
the
with
directions
to
walk
up
the
valley
and
bury
the
bodies
of
our
unfortunate
companions
the
two
men
who
had
accompanied
me
were
of
the
number
sent
on
this
service
when
they
returned
i
pointed
out
to
them
how
disastrous
our
residence
had
been
on
this
fatal
island
and
how
much
better
it
had
been
for
us
if
we
had
continued
our
course
to
rio
janeiro
which
being
only
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
and
sixty
leagues
distant
we
should
by
that
time
nearly
have
reached
that
we
were
now
expending
the
most
valuable
part
of
our
provisions
namely
our
spirits
and
tobacco
while
our
boat
our
only
hope
and
resource
was
not
even
in
safety
since
a
gale
of
wind
might
destroy
her
i
therefore
proposed
to
make
immediate
preparations
for
our
departure
to
which
all
unanimously
agreed
we
divided
the
various
occupations
some
went
to
fetch
a
sea
stock
of
young
birds
which
were
killed
and
dressed
to
save
our
salt
provisions
others
filled
all
our
captain
green
superintended
the
rigging
sails
and
oars
of
the
boat
and
saw
that
every
thing
was
complete
in
that
department
the
spirits
remaining
were
getting
low
and
captain
green
the
midshipman
and
myself
agreed
to
drink
none
but
reserve
it
for
pressing
emergencies
in
three
days
after
beginning
our
preparations
and
the
seventh
after
our
landing
we
embarked
and
after
being
nearly
swamped
by
the
surf
once
more
hoisted
our
sail
on
the
wide
waters
of
the
atlantic
ocean
we
were
not
destined
however
to
encounter
many
dangers
this
time
or
to
reach
the
coast
of
south
america
for
we
had
not
been
many
hours
at
sea
when
a
vessel
hove
in
sight
she
proved
to
be
an
american
privateer
brig
of
fourteen
guns
and
one
hundred
and
thirty
men
bound
on
a
cruise
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
as
soon
as
she
perceived
us
she
bore
down
and
in
we
were
safe
on
board
when
having
bundled
all
our
little
stock
of
goods
on
her
decks
the
boat
was
cut
adrift
my
men
were
not
well
treated
until
they
consented
to
enter
for
the
privateer
which
after
much
persuasion
and
threats
they
all
did
except
thompson
contrary
to
my
strongest
remonstrances
and
urging
every
argument
in
my
power
to
dissuade
them
from
such
a
fatal
step
i
remonstrated
with
the
captain
of
the
privateer
on
what
i
deemed
a
violation
of
hospitality
you
found
me
i
said
on
the
wide
ocean
in
a
frail
boat
which
some
huge
wave
might
have
overwhelmed
in
a
moment
or
some
fish
in
sport
might
have
tossed
in
the
air
you
received
me
and
my
people
with
all
the
kindness
and
friendship
which
we
could
desire
but
you
mar
it
by
seducing
the
men
from
their
allegiance
to
their
lawful
sovereign
inducing
them
to
become
rebels
and
subjecting
them
to
a
capital
punishment
whenever
they
may
as
they
most
probably
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
their
own
government
the
captain
who
was
an
unpolished
but
sensible
clearheaded
yankee
replied
that
he
was
sorry
i
should
take
any
thing
ill
of
him
that
no
affront
was
meant
to
me
that
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
my
men
until
they
came
voluntarily
to
him
and
entered
for
his
vessel
that
he
could
not
but
admit
however
that
they
might
have
been
persuaded
to
take
this
step
by
some
of
his
own
people
and
now
leftenant
said
he
let
me
ask
you
a
question
suppose
you
commanded
a
british
vessel
and
ten
or
twelve
of
my
men
if
i
was
unlucky
enough
to
be
taken
by
you
should
volunteer
for
your
ship
and
say
they
were
natives
of
newcastle
would
you
refuse
them
besides
before
we
went
to
war
with
you
you
made
no
ceremony
of
taking
men
out
of
our
and
even
out
of
our
ships
of
war
whenever
you
had
an
opportunity
now
pray
where
is
the
difference
between
your
conduct
and
ours
i
replied
that
it
would
not
be
very
easy
nor
if
it
were
would
it
answer
any
good
purpose
for
us
to
discuss
a
question
that
had
puzzled
the
wisest
heads
both
in
his
country
and
mine
for
the
last
twenty
years
that
my
present
business
was
a
case
of
its
own
and
must
be
considered
abstractedly
that
the
fortune
of
war
had
thrown
me
in
his
power
and
that
he
made
a
bad
use
of
the
temporary
advantage
of
his
situation
by
allowing
my
men
who
after
all
were
poor
ignorant
creatures
to
be
seduced
from
their
duty
to
desert
their
flag
and
commit
high
treason
by
which
their
lives
were
forfeited
and
their
families
rendered
miserable
that
whatever
might
have
been
the
conduct
of
his
government
or
mine
whatever
line
pursued
by
this
or
that
captain
no
precedent
could
make
wrong
right
and
i
left
it
to
himself
seeing
i
had
no
other
resource
to
say
whether
he
was
doing
as
he
would
be
done
by
as
for
that
matter
said
the
captain
we
trouble
our
heads
much
about
it
we
always
take
care
of
number
one
and
if
your
men
choose
to
say
they
are
natives
of
boston
and
will
enter
for
my
ship
i
must
take
them
why
continued
he
there
is
your
best
man
thompson
i
lay
a
demijohn
of
old
jamaica
rum
that
he
is
a
yankee
and
if
he
was
to
speak
his
mind
would
sooner
fight
under
the
stripes
than
the
union
d
n
the
dog
that
says
yon
of
jock
thompson
replied
the
caledonian
who
stood
by
i
never
deserted
my
colours
yet
and
i
do
think
i
ever
shall
there
is
only
one
piece
of
advice
i
would
wish
to
give
to
you
and
your
officers
captain
i
am
a
civil
spoken
man
and
never
injured
any
soul
breathing
except
in
the
way
of
fair
fighting
but
if
either
you
or
any
of
your
crew
offer
to
bribe
me
or
in
any
way
to
make
me
turn
my
back
on
my
king
and
country
i
lay
him
on
his
back
as
flat
as
a
flounder
if
i
am
able
and
if
i
am
not
able
i
try
for
it
that
well
spoken
said
the
captain
and
i
honour
you
for
it
you
may
rely
on
it
that
i
shall
never
tempt
you
and
if
any
of
mine
do
it
they
must
take
their
chance
captain
green
heard
all
this
conversation
he
took
no
part
in
it
but
walked
the
deck
in
his
usual
pensive
manner
when
the
captain
of
the
privateer
went
below
to
work
his
reckoning
this
unhappy
man
entered
into
conversation
with
me
he
began
by
remarking
what
a
noble
specimen
of
a
british
sailor
you
have
with
you
yes
i
replied
he
is
one
of
the
right
sort
he
comes
from
the
land
where
the
education
of
the
poor
contributes
to
the
security
of
the
rich
where
a
man
is
never
thought
the
worse
of
for
reading
his
bible
and
where
the
generality
of
the
lower
orders
are
brought
up
in
the
honest
simplicity
of
primitive
christians
i
guess
said
green
that
you
have
not
many
such
in
your
navy
more
than
you
would
suppose
i
replied
and
what
will
astonish
you
is
that
though
they
are
impressed
they
seldom
if
ever
desert
and
yet
they
are
retained
on
much
lower
wages
than
those
they
were
taken
from
or
could
obtain
but
they
have
a
high
sense
of
moral
and
religious
feeling
which
keeps
them
to
their
duty
they
must
needs
be
discontented
for
all
that
said
green
not
necessarily
so
said
i
they
derive
many
advantages
from
being
in
the
navy
which
they
could
not
have
in
other
employments
they
have
pensions
for
long
services
or
wounds
are
always
taken
care
of
in
their
old
age
and
their
widows
and
children
have
much
favour
shown
them
by
the
government
as
well
as
by
other
public
bodies
and
wealthy
individuals
but
we
must
finish
this
discussion
another
time
continued
i
for
i
perceive
the
dinner
is
going
into
the
cabin
i
received
from
the
captain
of
the
privateer
every
mark
of
respect
and
kindness
that
his
means
would
allow
much
of
this
i
owed
to
green
and
the
black
man
mungo
both
of
whom
had
represented
my
conduct
in
saving
the
life
of
him
who
had
endangered
mine
and
that
of
all
my
party
green
gratitude
knew
no
bounds
he
watched
me
night
and
day
as
a
mother
would
watch
a
darling
child
he
anticipated
any
want
or
wish
i
could
have
and
was
never
happy
until
it
was
gratified
the
seamen
on
board
the
vessel
were
all
equally
kind
and
attentive
to
me
so
highly
did
they
appreciate
the
act
of
saving
the
life
of
their
countryman
and
exposing
my
own
in
quelling
a
mutiny
we
cruised
to
the
southward
of
the
cape
and
made
one
or
two
captures
but
they
were
of
little
consequence
one
of
them
being
a
trader
from
mozambique
was
destroyed
the
other
a
slaver
from
madagascar
the
captain
knew
not
what
to
do
with
he
therefore
took
out
eight
or
ten
of
the
stoutest
male
negroes
to
assist
in
working
his
vessel
and
then
let
the
prize
go
chapter
xx
but
who
is
this
what
thing
of
sea
comes
this
way
sailing
like
a
stately
ship
with
all
her
bravery
on
and
tackle
trim
samson
agonistes
the
privateer
was
called
the
she
was
first
bound
to
the
island
of
tristan
where
she
expected
to
meet
her
consort
belonging
to
the
same
owners
and
who
had
preceded
her
when
their
directions
were
to
cruise
between
the
cape
and
madagascar
for
certain
homeward
bound
extra
indiamen
one
or
two
of
which
she
hoped
would
reward
all
the
trouble
and
expense
of
the
outfit
we
reached
the
island
without
any
material
incident
i
had
observed
with
concern
that
the
second
mate
whose
name
was
peleg
oswald
was
a
sour
ferocious
quarrelsome
man
and
that
although
i
was
kindly
treated
by
the
captain
whose
name
was
peters
and
by
the
chief
mate
whose
name
was
methusalem
solomon
i
never
could
conciliate
the
good
will
of
peleg
oswald
green
the
captain
who
came
with
me
was
from
the
time
i
saved
his
life
an
altered
man
he
had
been
as
i
was
informed
a
drunken
profligate
but
from
the
moment
when
i
received
him
into
my
boat
his
manners
and
habits
seemed
as
completely
changed
as
if
he
were
a
different
being
he
never
drank
more
than
was
sufficient
to
quench
his
thirst
he
never
swore
he
never
used
any
offensive
language
he
read
the
scriptures
constantly
was
regular
in
his
morning
and
evening
devotion
and
on
every
occasion
of
quarrel
or
in
the
brig
which
was
perpetually
occurring
green
was
the
umpire
and
the
he
saved
the
captain
and
chief
mate
a
world
of
trouble
by
this
system
violent
language
became
uncommon
on
board
punishment
was
very
rare
and
very
mild
the
men
were
happy
and
did
their
duty
with
alacrity
and
but
for
peleg
oswald
all
would
have
been
harmony
we
made
the
island
about
the
of
december
when
the
weather
was
such
as
the
season
of
the
year
might
induce
us
to
expect
it
being
then
summer
we
hove
off
to
the
north
or
windward
side
of
the
island
about
two
miles
from
the
shore
we
dared
not
go
nearer
on
that
side
for
fear
of
what
are
called
the
rollers
a
phenomenon
it
would
appear
of
terrific
magnitude
on
that
sequestered
little
spot
on
this
extraordinary
operation
of
nature
many
conjectures
have
been
offered
but
no
good
or
satisfactory
reason
has
ever
been
assigned
to
satisfy
my
mind
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
same
causes
would
produce
the
same
effect
on
st
helena
ascension
or
any
other
island
or
promontory
exposed
to
a
wide
expanse
of
water
i
shall
attempt
to
describe
the
scene
that
a
succession
of
rollers
would
present
supposing
what
has
indeed
happened
that
a
vessel
is
caught
on
the
coast
when
coming
in
the
water
will
be
perfectly
smooth
not
a
breath
of
wind
when
suddenly
from
the
north
comes
rolling
a
huge
wave
with
a
glassy
surface
never
breaking
till
it
meets
the
resistance
of
the
land
when
it
dashes
down
with
a
noise
and
a
resistless
violence
that
no
art
or
effort
of
man
could
elude
it
is
succeeded
by
others
no
anchorage
would
hold
if
there
were
anchorage
to
be
had
but
this
is
not
the
case
the
water
is
from
ninety
to
one
hundred
fathoms
deep
and
consequently
an
anchor
and
cable
could
scarcely
afford
a
momentary
check
to
any
ship
when
thus
assailed
or
if
it
did
the
sea
would
by
being
resisted
divide
break
on
board
and
swamp
her
such
was
the
fate
of
the
unfortunate
a
british
sloop
of
war
which
after
landing
the
captain
and
six
men
was
caught
in
the
rollers
driven
on
shore
and
every
creature
on
board
perished
only
the
captain
and
his
boat
crew
escaping
this
unfortunate
little
vessel
was
lost
not
from
want
of
skill
or
seamanship
in
the
captain
or
crew
for
a
finer
set
of
men
never
swam
salt
water
but
from
their
ignorance
of
this
peculiarity
of
the
island
unknown
in
any
other
that
i
ever
heard
of
at
least
to
such
an
alarming
extent
driven
close
in
to
the
land
before
she
could
find
soundings
at
last
she
let
go
three
anchors
but
nothing
could
withstand
the
force
of
the
rollers
which
drove
her
in
upon
the
beach
when
she
broke
in
two
as
soon
as
she
landed
and
all
hands
perished
in
sight
of
the
affected
captain
and
his
boat
crew
who
buried
the
bodies
of
their
unfortunate
shipmates
as
soon
as
the
sea
had
delivered
them
up
there
is
another
remarkable
peculiarity
in
this
island
its
shores
to
a
very
considerable
extent
out
to
sea
are
surrounded
with
the
plant
called
mentioned
by
captain
cook
it
grows
to
the
depth
of
sixty
fathoms
or
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
and
reaches
in
one
long
stem
to
the
surface
when
it
continues
to
run
along
to
the
enormous
length
of
three
or
four
hundred
feet
with
short
alternate
branches
at
every
foot
of
its
length
thus
in
the
stormy
ocean
grows
a
plant
higher
and
of
greater
length
than
any
vegetable
production
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
not
excepting
the
banyan
tree
which
as
its
branches
touch
the
ground
takes
fresh
root
and
may
be
said
to
form
a
separate
tree
these
marine
plants
resist
the
most
powerful
attacks
of
the
mightiest
elements
combined
the
winds
and
the
waves
in
vain
combine
their
force
against
them
uniting
their
foliage
on
the
bosom
of
the
waters
they
laugh
at
the
hurricane
and
defy
its
power
the
leaves
are
alternate
and
when
the
wind
ruffles
the
water
they
flap
over
one
after
the
other
with
a
mournful
sound
doubly
mournful
to
us
from
the
sad
association
of
ideas
and
the
loneliness
of
the
island
the
branches
or
tendrils
of
these
plants
are
so
strong
and
buoyant
when
several
of
them
happen
to
unite
that
a
boat
can
not
pass
through
them
i
tried
with
my
feet
what
pressure
they
would
bear
and
i
was
convinced
that
with
a
pair
of
snow
shoes
a
man
might
walk
over
them
captain
peters
kindly
invited
me
to
go
on
shore
with
him
we
landed
with
much
difficulty
and
proceeded
to
the
cottage
of
a
man
who
had
been
left
there
from
choice
he
resided
with
his
family
and
in
imitation
of
another
great
personage
on
an
island
to
the
northward
of
him
styled
himself
emperor
a
detachment
of
british
soldiers
had
been
sent
from
the
cape
of
good
hope
to
take
possession
of
this
spot
but
after
a
time
they
were
withdrawn
his
present
imperial
majesty
had
at
the
time
of
my
visit
a
black
consort
and
many
princes
and
princesses
he
was
in
other
respects
a
perfect
robinson
crusoe
he
had
a
few
head
of
cattle
and
some
pigs
these
latter
have
greatly
multiplied
on
the
island
domestic
fowls
were
numerous
and
he
had
a
large
piece
of
ground
planted
with
potatoes
the
only
place
south
of
the
equator
which
produces
them
in
their
native
perfection
the
land
is
rich
and
susceptible
of
great
improvement
and
the
soil
is
intersected
with
numerous
running
springs
over
its
surface
but
it
was
impossible
to
look
on
this
lonely
spot
without
recalling
to
mind
the
beautiful
lines
of
cowper
o
solitude
where
are
the
charms
that
sages
have
seen
in
thy
face
yet
in
this
wild
place
alarms
and
even
rebellion
had
found
their
way
the
emperor
had
but
one
subject
and
this
caliban
had
ventured
in
direct
violation
of
an
imperial
mandate
to
kill
a
fowl
for
his
dinner
rebellion
said
the
enraged
emperor
is
the
son
of
witchcraft
and
i
am
determined
to
make
an
example
of
the
offender
i
became
the
mediator
between
these
two
belligerents
i
represented
to
his
imperial
majesty
that
as
far
as
the
matter
of
example
went
the
severity
would
lose
its
effect
for
his
children
were
as
yet
too
young
to
be
corrupted
and
moreover
as
his
majesty
was
so
well
versed
in
scripture
he
must
know
that
it
was
his
duty
to
forgive
besides
i
said
her
majesty
the
queen
has
a
strong
arm
and
can
always
assist
in
repelling
or
chastising
any
future
act
of
aggression
or
disobedience
i
suspect
that
the
moral
code
of
his
majesty
was
not
unlike
my
own
it
yielded
to
the
necessities
of
the
time
he
must
have
found
it
particularly
inconvenient
not
to
be
on
speaking
terms
with
his
prime
minister
and
arch
chancellor
whom
he
had
banished
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
island
on
pain
of
death
the
sentence
was
originally
for
six
months
but
on
my
intercession
the
delinquent
was
pardoned
and
restored
to
favour
i
felt
much
when
i
reflected
on
this
successful
instance
of
my
mediatorial
power
which
had
perhaps
smothered
a
civil
war
in
its
birth
the
emperor
informed
me
that
an
american
whaler
was
lying
at
the
east
side
of
the
island
filling
with
the
oil
of
the
walrus
or
that
she
had
been
there
at
an
anchor
six
weeks
and
was
nearly
full
i
asked
to
be
shown
the
spot
where
the
was
wrecked
he
took
me
to
her
sad
remains
she
lay
broken
in
pieces
on
the
rocks
and
not
far
from
her
was
a
mound
of
earth
on
which
was
placed
a
painted
piece
of
board
by
way
of
a
tombstone
the
fate
of
the
vessel
together
with
the
number
of
sufferers
were
marked
in
rude
but
concise
characters
i
do
not
exactly
remember
the
words
but
in
substance
it
stated
that
underneath
lay
the
remains
of
one
hundred
as
fine
fellows
as
ever
walked
on
a
plank
and
that
they
had
died
like
british
seamen
doing
their
duty
to
the
last
this
was
a
melancholy
sight
especially
to
a
sailor
who
knew
not
how
soon
the
same
fate
awaited
him
we
rafted
off
several
casks
of
water
during
that
day
and
on
the
following
we
completed
our
water
and
then
ran
to
the
east
end
of
the
island
to
anchor
near
and
wait
for
our
consort
the
whaler
the
captain
of
which
had
come
in
his
boat
to
visit
us
i
conversed
with
him
and
was
struck
with
one
remark
which
he
made
you
englishmen
go
to
work
in
a
queerish
kind
of
way
said
he
you
send
a
parcel
of
soldiers
to
live
on
an
island
where
none
but
sailors
can
be
of
use
you
listen
to
all
that
those
red
coats
tell
you
they
never
thrive
when
placed
out
of
from
a
and
because
do
like
it
you
evacuate
the
island
a
soldier
likes
his
own
comfort
although
very
apt
to
destroy
that
of
other
folks
and
it
very
likely
he
would
go
and
make
a
good
report
of
an
island
that
had
neither
women
nor
rum
and
where
he
was
no
better
than
a
prisoner
now
if
brother
jonathan
had
taken
this
island
i
guess
he
would
a
made
it
pay
for
its
keep
he
would
have
had
two
or
three
crews
of
whalers
with
their
wives
and
families
and
all
their
little
comforts
about
them
with
a
party
of
good
farmers
to
till
the
land
and
an
officer
to
command
the
whole
the
island
can
provide
itself
as
you
may
perceive
and
all
would
have
gone
on
well
it
is
just
as
easy
to
the
island
from
the
shore
as
it
is
in
vessel
and
indeed
much
easier
only
land
your
boilers
and
casks
and
a
couple
of
dozen
of
good
and
this
island
would
produce
a
revenue
that
would
repay
with
profit
all
the
money
laid
out
upon
it
for
the
have
no
other
place
to
go
to
either
to
shed
their
coats
in
the
autumn
or
bring
forth
their
young
in
the
spring
the
fishing
and
other
duties
would
be
a
source
of
amusement
to
the
sailors
who
if
they
chose
might
return
home
occasionally
in
the
vessels
that
came
to
take
away
the
full
casks
of
oil
and
land
the
empty
ones
the
captain
of
the
whaler
returned
to
his
ship
but
i
suppose
forgot
to
give
our
captain
very
particular
directions
about
the
anchorage
we
ran
down
to
the
east
end
of
the
island
and
were
just
going
to
bring
up
when
supposing
himself
too
near
the
whaler
peters
chose
to
run
a
little
further
i
should
have
observed
that
as
we
rounded
the
point
the
breeze
freshed
and
the
squalls
came
heavy
out
of
the
gullies
and
deep
ravines
we
therefore
shortened
sail
and
passing
very
near
the
whaler
they
hailed
us
but
it
blew
so
fresh
that
we
did
not
hear
what
they
said
and
having
increased
our
distance
from
the
whaler
to
what
was
judged
proper
let
go
the
anchor
ninety
fathoms
of
cable
ran
out
in
a
crack
before
she
turned
head
and
to
our
mortification
we
found
we
had
passed
the
bank
upon
which
the
whaler
had
brought
up
and
must
have
dropped
our
anchor
into
a
well
for
we
had
nineteen
fathoms
water
under
the
bows
and
only
seven
fathoms
under
the
stern
the
moon
showed
her
face
just
at
this
moment
and
we
had
the
further
satisfaction
of
perceiving
that
we
were
within
fifty
yards
of
a
reef
of
rocks
which
lay
astern
of
us
with
their
dirty
black
heads
above
water
we
were
very
much
surprised
to
find
notwithstanding
the
depth
of
water
that
during
the
lulls
we
rode
with
a
slack
cable
but
about
two
in
the
morning
the
cable
parted
being
cut
by
the
foul
ground
all
sail
was
made
immediately
but
the
rocks
astern
were
so
close
to
us
that
you
might
have
thrown
a
biscuit
on
them
and
we
thought
the
cruise
of
the
was
at
an
end
but
it
proved
otherwise
for
the
same
cause
which
produced
the
slack
cable
preserved
the
vessel
the
we
found
had
interposed
between
us
and
destruction
we
had
let
go
our
anchor
in
this
forest
and
had
perched
as
it
were
on
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
so
thick
were
the
leaves
and
branches
that
they
held
us
from
driving
and
prevented
our
going
on
shore
when
the
cable
had
parted
we
dragged
slowly
through
the
plants
and
were
very
glad
to
see
ourselves
once
more
clear
of
this
miserable
spot
better
dwell
in
the
midst
of
alarms
than
reign
in
this
horrible
place
but
i
sincerely
wish
all
manner
of
success
to
this
little
empire
though
i
hope
my
evil
stars
will
never
take
me
to
it
again
we
shaped
our
course
for
the
cape
of
good
hope
for
captain
peters
would
not
run
further
risk
in
waiting
for
the
consort
privateer
poor
thompson
notwithstanding
all
my
exertions
in
his
favour
was
exposed
to
much
on
board
the
vessel
on
account
of
his
firm
and
unshaken
loyalty
he
seldom
complained
to
me
but
sometimes
vindicated
himself
by
a
gentle
hint
from
one
of
his
ample
fists
on
the
nose
or
eye
of
the
offender
and
here
the
matter
usually
ended
for
his
character
was
so
simple
and
inoffensive
that
all
the
best
men
in
the
vessel
loved
him
one
night
a
man
fell
overboard
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
brig
had
but
little
way
they
were
lowering
down
the
from
the
stern
when
one
of
the
hooks
by
which
she
hung
by
the
stern
broke
and
four
men
were
precipitated
with
violence
into
the
water
two
of
them
could
not
swim
and
all
screamed
loudly
for
help
as
soon
as
they
came
up
from
their
dive
thompson
seeing
this
darted
from
the
stern
like
a
newfoundland
dog
swam
to
the
weakest
supported
him
to
the
rudder
chains
and
leaving
him
went
to
another
bringing
him
to
the
stern
of
the
vessel
and
making
a
rope
fast
under
his
arms
in
this
way
he
succeeded
in
saving
the
whole
of
these
poor
fellows
two
of
the
five
would
certainly
have
sank
but
for
his
timely
assistance
for
they
were
some
time
before
another
boat
could
be
got
ready
and
the
other
three
owned
that
they
much
doubted
whether
they
could
have
reached
the
vessel
without
help
this
conduct
of
thompson
was
much
applauded
by
all
on
board
and
some
asked
him
why
he
ventured
his
life
for
people
who
had
used
him
so
ill
he
answered
that
his
mither
and
his
bible
taught
him
to
do
all
the
good
he
could
and
as
god
had
given
him
a
strong
arm
he
hoped
he
should
always
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
his
brother
in
need
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
an
act
like
this
would
have
prevented
the
recurrence
of
any
further
insult
but
the
more
the
americans
perceived
thompson
value
the
more
eager
were
they
to
have
him
as
their
own
the
second
mate
whom
i
have
already
described
as
a
rough
and
brutal
fellow
one
day
proposed
to
him
to
belong
to
their
vessel
certain
he
added
that
he
would
make
his
fortune
by
the
capture
of
two
if
not
three
extra
indiamen
which
they
had
information
of
on
their
passage
thompson
looked
the
man
fully
in
the
face
and
said
did
ye
no
hear
what
i
telled
the
captain
the
ither
day
yes
said
the
man
i
knew
that
but
that
what
we
call
in
our
country
my
eye
but
they
do
not
call
it
so
in
my
country
said
the
caledonian
at
the
same
time
planting
his
fist
so
full
and
plump
in
the
left
eye
of
the
mate
that
he
fell
like
the
covering
a
very
large
part
of
the
deck
with
his
huge
carcase
the
man
got
up
found
his
face
bleeding
plentifully
and
his
eye
closed
but
instead
of
resenting
the
insult
himself
went
off
and
complained
to
the
captain
many
of
the
americans
either
from
hatred
or
jealousy
went
along
with
him
and
clamorously
demanded
that
the
englishman
should
be
punished
for
striking
an
officer
when
the
story
however
came
to
be
fairly
explained
the
captain
said
he
was
bound
to
confess
that
the
second
mate
was
the
aggressor
inasmuch
as
he
had
acknowledged
that
he
knew
the
penalty
of
the
transgression
before
he
committed
the
act
that
he
the
captain
had
told
thompson
when
he
made
the
declaration
that
he
thought
him
perfectly
right
and
consequently
he
was
bound
to
protect
him
by
every
law
of
hospitality
as
well
as
gratitude
after
his
services
in
saving
the
lives
of
their
countrymen
this
did
not
satisfy
the
crew
they
were
clamorous
for
punishment
and
a
mutiny
was
actually
headed
by
the
second
mate
there
was
however
a
large
party
on
board
who
were
in
no
humour
to
see
an
englishman
treated
with
such
indignity
of
what
country
they
were
may
readily
be
conjectured
the
dispute
ran
high
and
i
began
to
think
that
serious
consequences
might
ensue
for
it
had
continued
from
the
serving
of
grog
at
twelve
till
near
two
when
casting
my
eyes
over
the
larboard
quarter
i
perceived
a
sail
and
told
the
captain
of
it
he
instantly
hailed
the
at
the
mast
head
but
the
had
been
so
much
interested
with
what
was
going
on
upon
deck
that
he
had
come
down
into
the
main
top
to
listen
do
you
see
that
sail
on
the
larboard
quarter
said
the
captain
yes
sir
said
the
man
and
why
did
you
not
report
her
the
man
could
make
no
reply
to
this
question
for
a
very
obvious
reason
come
down
here
said
the
captain
let
him
be
released
solomon
we
will
show
you
a
little
yankee
discipline
but
before
we
proceed
to
the
investigation
of
the
crime
or
the
infliction
of
punishment
we
must
turn
our
eyes
to
the
great
object
which
rose
clearer
and
clearer
every
five
minutes
above
the
horizon
the
privateer
was
at
this
time
under
top
sails
and
jib
and
foresail
running
to
the
with
a
fine
breeze
and
smooth
water
leftenant
said
the
captain
what
do
you
think
of
her
i
think
said
i
that
she
is
an
extra
indiaman
and
if
you
mean
to
speak
her
you
had
better
put
your
head
towards
her
under
an
easy
sail
by
which
means
you
will
be
so
near
by
sunset
that
if
she
runs
from
you
you
will
be
able
with
your
superior
sailing
to
keep
sight
of
her
all
night
i
guess
you
are
not
far
wrong
in
that
said
the
captain
i
guess
he
is
directly
in
the
face
of
the
truth
said
the
chief
mate
who
had
just
returned
from
the
main
top
where
he
had
spent
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
most
intense
and
absorbed
attention
to
the
cut
of
the
stranger
sails
if
i
saw
wood
and
canvas
put
together
before
in
the
shape
of
a
ship
that
there
is
one
of
john
bull
bellowing
calves
of
the
ocean
and
not
less
than
a
gunner
what
say
you
to
that
leftenant
said
the
captain
oh
as
to
that
said
the
mate
it
is
very
likely
that
he
going
to
tell
us
the
truth
because
you
would
not
have
done
it
yourself
in
the
same
situation
said
i
just
so
said
the
mate
and
in
fact
i
must
own
that
i
had
no
particular
wish
to
cruise
for
some
months
in
this
vessel
and
go
back
for
water
at
tristan
i
therefore
did
not
use
my
very
best
optical
skill
when
i
gave
my
opinion
but
as
i
saw
the
stranger
was
nearing
us
very
fast
although
we
were
steering
the
same
way
i
made
my
mind
up
that
i
should
very
soon
be
out
of
this
vessel
and
on
my
way
to
england
where
all
my
happiness
and
prospects
were
centred
the
chief
mate
took
one
more
look
the
captain
followed
his
example
they
then
looked
at
each
other
and
pronounced
their
cruise
at
an
end
we
are
done
sir
said
the
mate
and
all
owing
to
that
d
d
english
renegado
that
you
would
enter
on
the
books
as
one
of
the
ship
company
but
let
have
him
aft
and
give
him
his
discharge
regularly
first
of
all
said
the
captain
suppose
we
try
what
is
to
be
done
with
our
heels
they
used
to
be
good
and
i
never
saw
the
sarpent
that
could
come
anear
us
yet
send
the
royal
yards
up
clear
away
the
keep
her
with
the
wind
just
two
points
abaft
the
beam
that
her
favourite
position
and
i
think
we
may
give
the
slip
to
that
devil
in
the
course
of
the
night
i
said
nothing
but
looked
very
attentively
to
all
that
was
doing
the
vessel
was
well
manned
certainly
and
all
sail
was
set
upon
her
in
a
very
expeditious
manner
heave
the
log
said
the
captain
they
did
so
and
she
was
going
by
their
measurement
nine
and
six
what
do
you
think
your
ship
is
doing
said
the
captain
to
me
i
think
said
i
she
is
going
about
eleven
knots
and
as
she
is
six
miles
astern
of
you
that
she
will
be
within
gunshot
in
less
than
four
hours
part
of
that
time
shall
be
spent
in
paying
our
debts
for
this
favour
said
the
captain
mr
solomon
let
them
seize
that
rascal
up
to
the
main
rigging
and
hand
up
two
of
your
most
hungry
cats
where
is
dick
twist
he
that
was
boatswain
mate
of
the
and
that
fellow
you
know
that
swam
away
from
the
maidstone
in
the
you
mean
carroty
sam
i
guess
pass
the
word
for
sam
gall
the
two
operators
soon
appeared
each
armed
with
the
instruments
of
his
office
and
i
must
say
that
in
malignity
of
construction
they
were
equal
to
any
thing
used
on
similar
occasions
even
by
captain
g
the
culprit
was
now
brought
forward
and
to
my
surprise
it
was
the
very
man
whom
thompson
when
in
the
boat
had
thrown
overboard
for
mutiny
i
can
not
say
that
i
felt
sorry
for
the
cause
or
the
effect
that
was
likely
to
be
produced
by
the
disputes
of
the
day
seize
him
up
said
the
captain
you
were
sent
to
the
in
your
regular
turn
of
duty
and
you
have
neglected
that
duty
by
which
means
we
are
likely
to
be
taken
so
before
my
authority
ceases
i
will
show
you
a
yankee
trick
i
am
an
englishman
said
the
man
and
appeal
to
my
officer
for
protection
the
captain
looked
at
me
if
i
am
the
officer
you
appeal
to
said
i
i
do
not
acknowledge
you
you
threw
off
your
allegiance
when
you
thought
it
suited
your
purpose
and
you
now
wish
to
resume
it
to
screen
yourself
from
a
punishment
which
you
richly
deserve
i
shall
certainly
not
interfere
in
your
favour
i
was
born
roared
the
cockney
in
earl
street
seven
dials
my
mother
keeps
a
i
am
a
true
born
briton
and
you
have
no
right
to
flog
me
you
was
a
yankee
sailor
from
new
london
yesterday
and
you
are
a
from
old
london
i
think
i
am
right
in
calling
you
a
rascal
but
we
will
talk
about
the
right
another
time
said
the
captain
meanwhile
dick
twist
do
you
begin
twist
obeyed
his
orders
with
skill
and
accuracy
and
having
given
the
prisoner
three
dozen
that
would
not
have
disgraced
the
of
my
friend

acquitted
himself
with
the
like
number
and
the
prisoner
after
a
due
proportion
of
bellowing
was
cast
loose
i
could
not
help
reflecting
how
very
justly
this
captain
had
got
his
vessel
into
jeopardy
by
first
allowing
a
man
to
be
seduced
from
his
allegiance
and
then
placing
confidence
in
him
let
us
now
take
a
look
at
the
chase
said
the
captain
zounds
she
draws
up
with
us
i
can
see
her
when
she
lifts
and
half
an
hour
ago
i
only
saw
her
foreyard
cut
away
the
from
the
stern
solomon
the
chief
mate
took
a
small
axe
and
with
a
steady
blow
at
the
end
of
each
davit
divided
the
falls
and
the
boat
fell
into
the
sea
throw
these
here
two
aftermost
guns
overboard
said
the
captain
i
guess
we
are
too
deep
abaft
and
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
to
us
in
the
way
of
defence
for
this
is
a
wapper
that
after
us
the
guns
in
a
few
minutes
were
sent
to
their
last
rest
and
for
the
next
the
enemy
gained
less
upon
them
it
was
now
about
three
the
courage
of
the
yankees
revived
and
the
second
mate
reminded
the
captain
that
his
black
eye
had
not
been
reckoned
for
at
the
main
rigging
nor
shall
it
be
said
the
captain
while
i
command
the
what
is
is
right
no
man
shall
be
punished
for
fair
defence
after
warning
thompson
come
and
stand
aft
the
man
was
in
the
act
of
obeying
this
order
when
he
was
seized
on
by
some
six
or
eight
of
the
most
turbulent
who
began
to
tear
off
his
jacket
avast
there
shipmates
said
twist
and
gall
both
in
a
breath
we
do
mind
touching
up
such
a
chap
as
this
here
tripeman
but
not
the
scratch
of
a
pin
does
thompson
get
in
this
vessel
he
is
one
of
us
he
is
a
seamen
every
inch
of
him
and
you
must
flog
us
and
some
fifty
more
if
once
you
begin
for
d
n
my
eyes
if
we
do
heave
the
log
with
the
second
mate
and
then
till
the
frigate
comes
along
side
the
mutineers
stood
aghast
for
a
few
seconds
but
the
second
mate
jumping
on
a
gun
called
out
who
of
our
side
are
we
going
to
be
bullied
by
these
d
d
britishers
you
are
said
i
if
doing
an
act
of
justice
is
bullying
you
are
in
great
danger
and
i
warn
you
of
it
i
perceive
the
force
of
those
whom
you
pretend
to
call
americans
and
though
i
am
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
sanction
an
act
of
treachery
by
heaving
the
ship
to
yet
i
caution
you
to
beware
how
you
provoke
the
who
has
only
broke
his
master
chain
a
lark
and
is
ready
to
return
to
him
i
am
your
guest
and
therefore
your
faithful
friend
use
your
utmost
endeavours
to
escape
from
your
enemy
i
know
what
she
is
for
i
know
her
well
and
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
you
have
scarcely
more
time
with
all
your
exertions
than
to
pack
up
your
things
for
be
assured
you
will
not
pass
twelve
hours
more
under
your
own
flag
this
address
had
a
tranquillising
effect
the
captain
captain
green
and
solomon
walked
aft
and
to
their
great
dismay
saw
distinctly
the
water
line
of
the
pursuing
frigate
what
can
be
done
said
the
captain
she
has
gained
on
us
in
this
manner
while
the
people
were
all
aft
settling
that
infernal
dispute
throw
two
more
of
the
after
guns
overboard
this
order
was
obeyed
with
the
same
celerity
as
the
former
but
not
with
the
same
success
the
captain
now
began
to
perceive
what
was
pretty
obvious
to
me
before
namely
that
by
dropping
the
boat
from
the
extreme
end
of
the
vessel
where
it
hung
like
the
pea
on
the
steelyard
he
did
good
the
lightening
her
also
of
the
two
aftermost
guns
hanging
over
the
dead
wood
of
the
vessel
were
in
like
manner
serviceable
but
here
he
should
have
stopped
the
effect
of
throwing
the
next
two
guns
overboard
was
pernicious
the
vessel
fell
by
the
head
her
stern
was
out
of
the
water
she
steered
wild
yawed
and
decreased
in
her
rate
of
sailing
in
a
surprising
manner
cut
away
the
bower
anchors
said
the
captain
the
stoppers
were
cut
and
the
anchors
dropped
the
brig
immediately
recovered
herself
from
her
oppression
as
it
were
and
resumed
her
former
velocity
but
the
enemy
had
by
this
time
made
fearful
approaches
the
only
hope
of
the
captain
and
his
crew
was
in
the
darkness
and
as
this
darkness
came
on
my
spirits
decreased
for
i
greatly
feared
that
we
should
have
escaped
the
sun
had
sunk
some
time
below
the
horizon
the
cloud
of
sail
coming
up
astern
of
us
began
to
be
indistinct
and
at
last
disappeared
altogether
in
a
black
squall
we
saw
no
more
of
her
for
nearly
two
hours
i
walked
the
deck
with
green
and
the
captain
the
latter
seemed
in
great
perturbation
he
had
hoped
to
make
his
fortune
and
retire
from
the
toils
and
cares
of
a
in
some
snug
corner
of
the
western
settlements
where
he
might
cultivate
a
little
farm
and
lead
the
life
of
an
honest
man
for
life
said
he
i
am
free
to
confess
is
after
all
little
better
than
highway
robbery
whether
the
moral
essay
of
the
captain
was
the
effect
of
his
present
danger
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
i
only
know
that
if
the
reader
will
turn
back
to
some
parts
of
my
history
he
will
find
me
very
often
in
a
similar
mood
on
similar
occasions
the
two
captains
and
the
chief
mate
now
retired
after
leaving
me
meditating
by
myself
over
the
larboard
gunwale
just
before
the
main
rigging
the
consultation
seemed
to
be
of
great
moment
and
as
i
afterwards
learned
was
to
decide
what
course
they
should
steer
seeing
that
they
evidently
lost
sight
of
their
pursuer
i
felt
all
my
hopes
of
release
vanish
as
i
looked
at
them
and
had
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
new
york
at
this
moment
a
man
came
behind
me
as
if
to
get
a
pull
at
the
sheets
and
while
he
hung
down
upon
it
with
a
kind
of
he
whispered
in
my
ear
you
may
have
the
command
of
the
brig
if
you
like
we
are
we
will
heave
her
to
and
hoist
a
light
if
you
will
only
say
the
word
and
promise
us
our
free
pardon
i
pretended
at
first
not
to
hear
but
turning
round
i
saw
mr
twist
hold
villain
said
i
do
you
think
to
redeem
one
act
of
treachery
by
another
and
do
you
dare
to
insult
the
honour
of
a
naval
officer
with
a
proposal
so
infamous
go
to
your
station
instantly
and
think
yourself
fortunate
that
i
do
not
denounce
you
to
the
captain
who
has
a
perfect
right
to
throw
you
overboard
a
fate
which
your
chain
of
crimes
fully
deserves
the
man
skulked
away
and
i
went
off
to
the
captain
to
whom
i
related
the
circumstance
desiring
him
to
be
on
his
guard
against
treachery
your
conduct
sir
said
the
captain
is
what
i
should
have
expected
from
a
british
naval
officer
and
since
you
have
behaved
so
honourably
i
will
freely
tell
you
that
my
intention
is
to
shorten
sail
to
the
topsails
and
foresail
and
haul
dead
on
a
wind
into
that
dark
squall
to
the
southward
as
you
please
said
i
you
can
not
expect
that
i
should
advise
nor
would
you
believe
me
if
i
said
i
wished
you
success
but
rely
on
it
i
will
resist
by
every
means
in
my
power
any
unfair
means
to
dispossess
you
of
your
command
i
thank
you
sir
said
the
captain
mournfully
and
without
losing
any
more
time
in
useless
words
shorten
sail
there
continued
he
with
a
low
but
firm
voice
take
in
the
lower
and
topmost
hands
aloft
in
and
roll
up
the
sails
all
this
appeared
to
be
done
with
surprising
speed
even
to
me
who
had
been
accustomed
to
very
well
conducted
ships
of
war
one
mistake
however
was
made
the
lower
instead
of
being
hauled
in
on
deck
was
let
to
fall
overboard
and
towed
some
time
under
the
larboard
bow
before
it
was
reported
to
the
officers
haul
in
the
larboard
braces
brace
sharp
up
port
the
helm
and
bring
her
to
the
wind
port
it
is
sir
said
the
man
at
the
helm
and
the
vessel
was
close
hauled
upon
the
starboard
tack
but
she
did
not
seem
to
move
very
fast
although
she
had
a
square
mainsail
boom
mainsail
and
jib
i
think
we
have
done
them
at
last
said
the
captain
what
do
you
think
leftenant
giving
me
a
hearty
but
very
friendly
slap
on
the
back
come
what
say
you
shall
we
take
a
cool
bottle
of
london
particular
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
wait
a
little
said
i
wait
a
little
what
are
you
looking
at
there
to
windward
said
the
captain
who
perceived
that
my
eye
was
fixed
on
a
particular
point
before
i
had
time
to
answer
thompson
came
up
to
me
and
said
there
is
the
ship
sir
pointing
to
the
very
spot
on
which
i
was
gazing
the
captain
heard
this
and
as
fear
is
ever
he
instantly
caught
the
object
running
is
of
no
use
now
said
he
we
have
tried
her
off
the
wind
our
best
going
she
beats
us
at
that
and
on
a
wind
i
do
think
so
much
of
her
but
still
with
this
smooth
water
and
fine
breeze
she
ought
to
move
better
solomon
there
is
something
wrong
give
a
look
all
round
solomon
went
forward
on
the
starboard
side
but
saw
nothing
as
he
looked
over
the
gangway
and
bow
coming
round
on
the
lee
side
of
the
forecastle
he
saw
some
canvas
hanging
on
one
of
the
what
have
we
here
said
he
no
one
answered
he
looked
over
the
fore
chains
and
found
the
whole
lower
towing
in
the
water
no
wonder
she
do
move
said
the
mate
here
is
enough
to
stop
the
constitution
herself
who
took
in
this
here
lower
but
never
mind
we
settle
that
come
over
here
you
forecastle
men
some
of
the
americans
came
over
to
him
but
not
with
very
great
alacrity
the
sail
could
not
be
pulled
in
as
the
vessel
had
too
much
way
and
while
they
were
ineffectually
employed
about
it
the
flash
of
a
gun
was
seen
to
windward
and
as
the
report
reached
our
ears
the
shot
whistled
over
our
heads
and
darted
like
lightning
through
the
boom
mainsail
hurra
for
old
england
said
thompson
the
fellow
that
fired
that
shot
shall
drink
my
allowance
of
grog
hold
your
tongue
you
d
d
english
rascal
said
the
second
mate
or
i
stop
your
grog
for
ever
i
do
think
you
will
said
the
north
briton
and
if
you
take
a
friend
advice
you
wo
try
thompson
was
standing
on
the
little
or
poop
the
indignant
mate
jumped
up
and
collared
him
thompson
disengaged
him
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
with
one
blow
of
his
right
hand
in
the
pit
of
the
man
stomach
sent
him
reeling
over
to
leeward
he
fell
caught
at
the
missed
it
and
tumbled
into
the
sea
from
whence
he
rose
no
more
all
was
now
confusion
a
man
overboard
another
shot
from
the
frigate
another
and
another
in
quick
succession
the
fate
of
the
man
was
forgotten
in
the
general
panic
one
shot
cut
the
aftermost
another
went
through
the
boat
on
the
booms
the
frigate
was
evidently
very
near
us
the
men
all
rushed
down
to
seize
their
bags
and
chests
the
captain
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
sir
i
surrender
myself
to
you
and
give
you
leave
now
to
act
as
you
think
proper
thompson
said
i
let
go
the
and
the
running
forward
myself
i
let
go
the
and
bowlines
the
came
square
of
itself
thompson
got
a
lantern
which
he
held
up
on
the
starboard
quarter
the
frigate
passed
close
under
the
stern
shewing
a
beautiful
pale
side
with
a
fine
tier
of
guns
and
hailing
us
desired
to
know
what
vessel
it
was
i
replied
that
it
was
the
of
boston
that
she
had
and
surrendered
chapter
xxi
it
is
not
says
blake
the
business
of
a
seaman
to
mind
state
affairs
but
to
hinder
foreigners
from
fooling
us
dr
of
the
frigate
came
to
the
wind
close
under
our
lee
and
a
boat
from
her
was
alongside
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
officer
who
came
to
take
possession
leaped
up
the
side
and
was
on
the
deck
in
a
moment
i
received
him
told
him
in
few
words
what
the
vessel
was
introducing
the
captain
and
green
both
of
whom
i
recommended
to
his
particular
notice
and
attention
for
the
kindness
they
had
shown
to
me
i
then
requested
he
would
walk
down
into
the
cabin
leaving
a
midshipman
whom
he
brought
with
him
in
charge
of
the
deck
and
who
in
the
meanwhile
he
directed
to
haul
the
mainsail
up
and
make
the
vessel
snug
the
prisoners
were
desired
to
pack
up
their
things
and
be
ready
to
quit
in
one
hour
when
lights
were
brought
in
the
cabin
the
lieutenant
and
myself
instantly
recognised
each
other
bless
my
soul
frank
said
he
what
brought
you
here
that
said
i
is
rather
a
longer
story
than
could
be
conveniently
told
before
but
may
i
ask
what
ship
has
taken
the
yankee
i
conclude
it
is
the
and
what
rank
does
friend
talbot
hold
in
her
the
frigate
said
he
the
as
you
conjectured
we
are
on
the
cape
station
i
am
first
of
her
and
sent
out
here
on
promotion
for
the
affair
of
basque
roads
hard
indeed
said
i
that
you
should
have
waited
so
long
for
what
you
so
nobly
earned
but
come
we
have
much
to
do
let
us
look
to
the
prisoners
and
if
you
will
return
on
board
taking
with
you
the
captain
mate
and
a
few
of
the
hands
whom
i
will
select
as
the
most
troublesome
and
the
most
careless
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
have
the
prize
ready
for
making
sail
by
daylight
when
if
captain
t
will
give
me
leave
i
will
wait
on
him
this
was
agreed
to
the
people
whom
i
pointed
out
were
put
into
the
boat
four
of
whose
crew
came
aboard
the
brig
to
assist
me
we
soon
arranged
every
thing
so
as
to
be
ready
for
whatever
might
be
required
a
boat
returned
with
a
fresh
supply
of
hands
taking
back
about
twenty
more
prisoners
and
the
midshipman
who
brought
them
delivered
also
a
civil
message
from
the
captain
to
say
he
was
glad
to
have
the
prize
in
such
good
hands
and
would
expect
me
to
breakfast
with
him
at
eight
in
the
meantime
he
desired
that
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
to
make
sail
i
should
signify
the
same
by
showing
two
lights
at
the
same
height
in
the
main
rigging
and
that
we
should
then
keep
on
a
wind
to
the
northward
under
a
plain
sail
this
was
completed
by
four
when
we
made
the
signal
and
kept
on
the
weather
quarter
of
the
frigate
i
took
a
couple
of
hours
sleep
was
called
at
six
dressed
myself
and
prepared
to
go
on
board
at
half
past
seven
i
heard
her
drum
and
fife
beat
to
quarters
the
sweetest
music
next
to
the
heavenly
voice
of
emily
i
had
ever
heard
the
tears
rolled
down
my
cheeks
with
gratitude
to
god
for
once
more
placing
me
under
the
protection
of
my
beloved
flag
the
frigate
soon
after
the
gig
was
lowered
down
and
came
to
fetch
me
a
clean
white
cloak
was
spread
in
the
stern
sheets
the
men
were
dressed
in
white
frocks
and
trousers
as
clean
as
hands
could
make
them
with
neat
straw
hats
and
canvas
shoes
i
was
seated
in
the
boat
without
delay
and
my
heart
beat
with
rapture
when
the
boatswain
mate
at
the
gangway
piped
the
side
for
me
i
was
received
by
the
captain
and
officers
with
all
the
kindness
and
affection
which
we
lavish
on
each
other
on
such
occasions
the
captain
asked
me
a
thousand
questions
and
the
lieutenants
and
midshipmen
all
crowded
round
me
to
hear
my
answers
the
ship
company
were
also
curious
to
know
our
history
and
i
requested
the
captain
would
send
the
gig
back
for
thompson
who
would
assist
me
in
gratifying
the
general
curiosity
this
was
done
and
the
brave
honest
fellow
came
on
board
the
first
question
he
asked
was
who
fired
the
first
shot
at
the
prize
it
was
mr
spears
the
first
lieutenant
of
marines
said
one
of
the
men
then
mr
spears
must
have
my
allowance
of
grog
for
the
day
said
thompson
for
i
said
it
last
night
and
i
never
go
from
my
word
that
i
am
ready
to
swear
to
said
captain
peters
of
the
privateer
i
have
known
men
of
good
resolutions
and
you
are
one
of
them
and
i
have
known
men
of
bad
resolutions
and
he
was
one
of
them
whom
you
sent
last
night
to
his
long
account
and
it
was
fortunate
for
you
that
you
did
for
as
sure
as
you
now
stand
here
that
man
would
have
compassed
your
death
either
by
dagger
by
water
or
by
poison
i
never
knew
or
heard
of
the
man
who
had
struck
or
injured
peleg
oswald
with
impunity
he
was
a
kentucky
man
of
the
ohio
where
he
had
as
we
say
but
he
shot
two
men
with
his
rifle
because
they
had
declined
exchanging
some
land
with
him
he
had
gouged
the
eye
out
of
a
third
for
some
trifling
difference
of
opinion
these
acts
obliged
him
to
quit
the
country
for
not
only
were
the
officers
of
justice
in
pursuit
of
him
but
the
man
who
had
lost
one
eye
kept
a
sharp
look
out
with
the
other
and
peleg
would
certainly
have
had
a
rifle
ball
in
his
ear
if
he
had
not
fled
eastward
and
taken
again
to
the
sea
to
which
he
was
originally
brought
up
i
did
not
know
all
his
history
till
long
after
he
and
i
became
shipmates
he
would
have
been
tried
for
his
life
but
having
made
some
prize
money
he
contrived
to
buy
off
his
prosecutors
i
should
have
unshipped
him
next
cruise
if
it
had
pleased
god
i
had
got
safe
back
while
peters
was
giving
this
little
history
of
his
departed
mate
the
captain
breakfast
was
announced
and
the
two
american
captains
were
invited
to
partake
of
it
as
we
went
down
the
ladder
under
the
peters
and
green
could
not
help
casting
an
eye
of
admiration
at
the
clean
and
clear
deck
the
style
of
the
guns
and
perfect
union
of
the
useful
and
ornamental
so
inimitably
blended
as
they
are
sometimes
found
in
our
ships
of
war
there
was
nothing
in
the
captain
repast
beyond
cleanliness
plenty
hearty
welcome
and
cheerfulness
the
conversation
turned
on
the
nature
quality
and
number
of
men
in
the
privateer
they
are
all
seamen
said
peters
except
the
ten
black
fellows
some
of
them
i
suspect
are
english
said
i
it
is
not
for
me
to
peach
said
the
wary
american
it
is
difficult
always
to
know
whether
a
man
who
has
been
much
in
both
countries
is
a
native
of
boston
in
lincolnshire
or
boston
in
massachusetts
and
perhaps
they
do
always
know
themselves
we
never
ask
questions
when
a
seaman
ships
for
us
you
have
an
abundance
of
our
seamen
both
in
your
marine
and
merchant
service
said
our
captain
yes
said
green
and
we
are
never
likely
to
want
them
while
you
impress
for
us
impress
for
you
said
captain
t
how
do
you
prove
that
your
impressment
said
the
american
fills
our
ships
your
seamen
will
not
stand
it
and
for
every
two
men
you
take
by
force
rely
on
it
we
get
one
of
them
as
a
volunteer
peters
dissented
violently
from
this
proposition
and
appeared
angry
with
green
for
making
the
assertion
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
it
said
green
i
know
how
our
fighting
ships
as
well
as
our
traders
are
manned
i
will
take
my
oath
that
more
than
have
run
from
the
british
navy
because
they
were
impressed
you
yourself
have
said
so
in
my
hearing
peters
look
at
your
crew
peters
could
stand
conviction
no
longer
he
burst
into
the
most
violent
rage
with
green
said
that
what
ought
never
to
have
been
owned
to
a
british
officer
he
had
let
out
that
it
was
true
that
america
looked
upon
our
system
of
impressment
as
the
of
her
navy
but
he
was
sorry
the
important
secret
should
ever
have
escaped
from
an
american
for
my
part
resumed
green
i
feel
so
deeply
indebted
to
this
gallant
young
englishman
for
his
kindness
to
me
that
i
am
for
ever
the
friend
of
himself
and
his
country
and
have
sworn
never
to
carry
arms
against
great
britain
unless
to
repel
an
invasion
of
my
own
country
breakfast
ended
we
all
went
on
deck
the
ship
and
her
prize
were
lying
to
the
hands
were
turned
up
all
the
boats
hoisted
out
the
prisoners
and
their
luggage
taken
out
of
the
prize
and
as
the
crew
of
the
privateer
came
on
board
they
were
all
drawn
up
on
the
and
many
of
them
known
and
proved
to
be
englishmen
when
taxed
and
reproached
for
their
infamous
conduct
they
said
it
was
owing
to
them
that
the
privateer
had
been
taken
for
that
they
had
left
the
lower
purposely
hanging
over
the
and
towing
in
the
water
by
which
the
way
of
the
vessel
had
been
impeded
captain
peters
who
heard
this
confession
was
astonished
and
the
captain
of
the
frigate
observed
to
him
that
such
conduct
was
exactly
that
which
might
be
expected
from
any
traitor
to
his
country
then
turning
to
the
prisoners
he
said
the
infamy
of
your
first
crime
could
scarcely
have
been
increased
but
your
treachery
to
the
new
government
under
which
you
had
placed
yourselves
renders
you
unworthy
of
the
name
of
men
nor
have
you
even
the
miserable
merit
you
claim
of
having
contributed
to
the
capture
since
we
never
lost
sight
of
the
chase
from
the
first
moment
we
saw
her
and
from
the
instant
she
hauled
her
wind
we
knew
she
was
ours
the
men
hung
down
their
heads
and
when
dismissed
to
go
below
none
of
the
crew
of
the
frigate
would
receive
them
into
their
messes
but
the
real
americans
were
kindly
treated
we
shaped
our
course
for
simon
bay
where
we
arrived
in
one
week
after
the
capture
the
admiral
on
the
station
refused
to
try
the
prisoners
by
a
he
said
it
was
rather
a
state
question
and
should
send
them
all
to
england
where
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
might
dispose
of
them
as
they
thought
proper
the
was
libelled
in
the
vice
admiralty
court
at
cape
town
condemned
as
a
lawful
prize
and
purchased
into
the
service
and
being
a
very
fine
vessel
of
her
class
the
admiral
was
pleased
to
say
that
as
i
had
been
so
singularly
unfortunate
he
would
give
me
the
command
of
her
as
a
lieutenant
and
send
me
to
england
with
some
despatches
which
had
been
waiting
an
opportunity
this
was
an
arrangement
far
more
advantageous
to
me
than
i
could
have
expected
but
what
rendered
it
still
more
agreeable
was
that
my
friend
talbot
who
was
the
first
to
shake
me
by
the
hand
on
board
the
prize
begged
a
passage
home
with
me
he
having
by
the
last
packet
received
his
commander
commission
the
admiral
at
my
request
also
gave
captains
peters
and
green
permission
to
go
home
with
me
mungo
the
black
man
and
thompson
the
with
the
midshipman
who
had
been
with
me
in
the
boat
were
also
of
the
party
my
crew
was
none
of
the
very
best
as
might
be
supposed
but
i
was
not
in
a
state
to
make
difficulties
and
with
of
the
new
negroes
taken
out
of
the
trader
i
made
up
such
a
ship
company
as
i
thought
would
enable
me
to
run
to
spithead
we
laid
in
a
good
stock
provisions
at
the
cape
the
americans
begged
to
be
allowed
to
pay
their
part
but
this
i
positively
refused
declaring
myself
too
happy
in
having
them
as
my
guests
i
purchased
all
captain
peters
wine
and
stock
giving
him
the
full
value
for
it
mungo
was
appointed
steward
for
i
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
him
and
my
friend
talbot
having
brought
all
his
things
on
board
and
the
admiral
having
given
my
final
orders
i
sailed
from
simon
bay
for
england
there
is
usually
but
little
of
incident
in
a
run
home
of
this
sort
i
was
not
directed
to
stop
at
st
helena
and
had
no
inclination
to
loiter
on
my
way
i
carried
sail
night
and
day
to
the
very
utmost
talbot
and
myself
became
inseparable
friends
and
our
cabin
mess
was
one
of
perfect
harmony
we
avoided
all
national
reflections
and
abstained
as
much
as
possible
from
politics
i
made
a
confidant
of
talbot
in
my
love
affair
with
emily
of
poor
eugenia
i
had
long
before
told
him
a
great
deal
one
day
at
dinner
we
happened
to
talk
of
swimming
i
think
said
talbot
that
my
friend
frank
is
as
good
a
hand
at
that
as
any
of
us
do
you
remember
when
you
swam
away
from
the
frigate
at
spithead
to
pay
a
visit
to
your
friend
mrs
melpomene
at
point
i
do
said
i
and
also
how
generously
you
showered
the
about
my
ears
for
the
same
your
escape
from
either
drowning
or
shooting
on
that
occasion
among
many
others
said
the
commander
makes
me
augur
something
more
serious
of
your
future
destiny
that
may
be
said
i
but
i
dispute
the
legality
of
your
act
in
trying
to
kill
me
before
you
knew
who
i
was
or
what
i
was
about
i
might
have
been
mad
for
what
you
knew
or
i
might
have
belonged
to
some
other
ship
but
in
any
event
had
you
killed
me
and
had
my
body
been
found
a
coroner
inquest
would
have
gone
very
hard
with
you
and
a
jury
still
worse
i
should
have
laughed
at
them
said
talbot
you
might
have
found
it
no
laughing
matter
said
i
how
replied
talbot
what
are
sentinels
placed
for
and
loaded
with
ball
to
defend
the
ship
said
i
to
give
warning
of
approaching
danger
to
prevent
men
going
out
of
the
ship
without
leave
but
never
to
take
away
the
life
of
a
man
unless
in
defence
of
their
own
or
when
the
safety
of
the
king
ship
demands
it
i
deny
your
conclusion
said
talbot
the
articles
of
war
denounce
death
to
all
deserters
true
said
i
they
do
and
also
to
many
other
crimes
but
those
crimes
must
first
of
all
be
proved
before
a
now
you
can
not
prove
that
i
was
deserting
and
if
you
could
you
had
not
the
power
to
inflict
death
on
me
unless
i
was
going
towards
the
enemy
i
own
i
was
disobeying
your
orders
but
even
that
would
not
have
subjected
me
to
more
than
a
slight
punishment
while
your
arbitrary
act
would
have
deprived
the
king
as
i
flatter
myself
of
a
loyal
and
not
a
useless
subject
and
if
my
body
had
not
been
found
no
good
could
have
accrued
to
the
service
from
the
severity
of
example
on
the
contrary
many
would
have
supposed
i
had
escaped
and
been
encouraged
to
make
the
same
attempt
i
am
very
sorry
now
said
talbot
that
i
did
not
lower
down
a
boat
to
send
after
you
however
it
has
been
a
comfort
to
me
since
to
reflect
that
the
marines
missed
you
this
ended
the
subject
we
walked
the
deck
a
little
talked
of
sweethearts
shaped
the
course
for
the
night
to
make
fayal
which
we
were
not
far
from
and
then
returned
to
our
beds
falling
into
a
sound
sleep
it
was
natural
that
the
conversation
of
the
evening
should
have
dwelt
on
my
mind
and
a
strange
mixture
of
disjointed
thoughts
a
compound
of
reason
and
insanity
haunted
me
till
the
morning
trinidad
and
emily
the
rock
and
the
mysterious
eugenia
with
her
supposed
son
the
sinking
wreck
and
the
broken
schooner
all
appeared
separately
or
together
when
nature
rests
oft
in
her
absence
mimic
fancy
wakes
i
thought
i
saw
emily
standing
on
the
pinnacle
of
the
rock
just
as
lord
nelson
is
represented
on
the
monument
in
dublin
or
bonaparte
in
that
of
the
place
vendome
but
with
a
grace
as
far
superior
to
either
as
the
rock
is
in
majesty
and
natural
grandeur
to
those
works
of
human
art
emily
i
thought
was
clad
in
complete
mourning
but
looking
radiant
in
health
and
loveliness
although
with
a
melancholy
countenance
the
dear
image
of
my
mistress
seemed
to
say
i
shall
never
come
down
from
this
pinnacle
without
your
assistance
then
thinks
i
you
will
never
come
down
at
all
then
i
thought
eugenia
was
queen
of
trinidad
and
that
it
was
she
who
had
placed
emily
out
of
my
reach
on
the
rock
and
i
was
entreating
her
to
let
emily
come
down
when
thompson
tapped
at
my
cabin
door
and
told
me
that
it
was
daylight
and
that
they
could
see
the
island
of
fayal
in
the
distant
about
seven
leagues
i
dressed
myself
and
went
on
deck
saw
the
land
and
a
strange
sail
steering
to
the
westward
the
confounded
dream
still
running
in
my
head
like
adam
i
liked
it
not
and
yet
i
thought
myself
a
fool
for
not
dismissing
such
idle
stuff
still
it
would
not
go
away
the
americans
came
on
deck
soon
after
and
seeing
the
ship
steering
to
the
westward
asked
if
i
meant
to
speak
her
i
replied
in
the
affirmative
we
had
then
as
much
sail
as
we
could
carry
and
as
she
had
no
wish
to
avoid
us
but
kept
on
her
course
we
were
soon
alongside
of
her
she
proved
to
be
a
cartel
bound
to
new
york
with
american
prisoners
in
case
of
meeting
with
any
vessel
bound
to
the
united
states
the
admiral
had
given
me
permission
to
send
my
prisoners
home
without
carrying
them
to
england
i
had
not
mentioned
this
either
to
peters
or
green
for
fear
of
producing
disappointment
but
when
i
found
i
could
dispose
of
them
so
comfortably
i
acquainted
them
with
my
intention
their
joy
and
gratitude
were
beyond
all
description
they
thanked
me
a
thousand
times
as
they
did
my
friend
talbot
for
our
kindness
to
them
leftenant
said
peters
i
am
not
much
accustomed
to
the
company
of
you
englishmen
and
if
i
have
always
thought
you
a
set
of
tyrants
and
bullies
it
ar
my
fault
i
believed
what
i
was
told
but
now
i
have
seen
for
myself
and
i
find
the
devil
is
never
so
black
as
he
is
painted
i
bowed
to
the
yankee
compliment
howsoever
he
continued
i
should
like
to
have
a
sprinkling
of
shot
between
us
on
fair
terms
do
you
bring
this
here
brig
to
our
waters
i
hope
to
get
another
just
like
her
and
as
i
know
you
are
a
d
d
good
fellow
and
would
as
soon
have
a
dust
as
sit
down
to
dinner
i
should
like
to
try
to
get
the
command
of
the
again
if
you
man
your
next
brig
as
you
manned
the
last
with
all
your
best
hands
englishmen
said
i
i
fear
i
should
find
it
no
easy
matter
to
defend
myself
that
as
it
may
be
said
the
captain
no
man
fights
better
than
he
with
a
halter
round
his
neck
and
remember
what
neighbour
green
has
said
for
he
has
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
we
should
have
no
englishmen
in
our
service
if
they
had
not
been
pressed
into
yours
i
could
make
no
return
to
this
salute
because
like
the
gunner
at
landguard
fort
i
had
no
powder
and
in
fact
i
felt
the
rebuke
green
stood
by
but
never
opened
his
lips
until
the
captain
had
finished
then
holding
out
his
hand
to
me
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
and
his
voice
almost
choked
farewell
my
excellent
friend
said
he
i
shall
never
forget
you
you
found
me
a
villain
and
by
the
blessing
of
god
you
have
made
me
an
honest
man
never
never
shall
i
forget
the
day
when
at
the
risk
of
your
own
life
you
came
to
save
one
so
unworthy
of
your
protection
but
god
bless
you
and
if
ever
the
fortune
of
war
should
send
you
a
prisoner
to
my
country
here
is
my
address
what
is
mine
is
yours
and
so
you
shall
find
the
man
who
had
mutinied
in
the
boat
and
afterwards
entered
on
board
the
privateer
who
was
sent
home
with
me
to
take
his
trial
held
out
his
hand
to
captain
green
as
he
passed
him
to
wish
him
but
he
turned
away
saying
a
traitor
to
his
country
is
a
traitor
to
his
god
i
forgive
you
for
the
injury
you
intended
to
do
me
and
the
more
so
as
i
feel
i
brought
it
on
myself
but
i
can
not
degrade
myself
by
offering
you
the
hand
of
fellowship
so
saying
he
followed
captain
peters
into
the
boat
i
accompanied
them
to
the
cartel
where
having
satisfied
myself
that
they
had
every
comfort
i
left
them
green
was
so
overcome
that
he
could
not
speak
and
poor
mungo
could
only
say
massa
leptenant
me
tinkee
you
berry
good
man
i
returned
to
my
own
vessel
and
made
sail
for
england
once
more
we
greeted
the
white
cliffs
of
albion
so
dear
to
every
true
english
bosom
no
one
but
he
who
has
been
an
exile
from
its
beloved
shores
can
fully
appreciate
the
thrill
of
joy
on
such
an
occasion
we
ran
through
the
needles
and
i
anchored
at
spithead
after
an
absence
of
fourteen
months
i
waited
on
the
admiral
showed
him
my
orders
and
reported
the
prisoners
whom
he
desired
me
to
discharge
into
the
flag
ship
and
now
said
he
after
your
extraordinary
escape
i
will
give
you
leave
to
run
up
to
town
and
see
your
family
to
whom
you
are
no
doubt
an
object
of
great
interest
here
a
short
digression
is
necessary
chapter
xxii
such
was
my
brother
too
so
went
he
suited
to
his
watery
tomb
if
spirits
can
assume
both
form
and
suit
you
come
to
fright
us
soon
after
the
frigate
which
had
taken
me
off
from
new
providence
had
parted
company
with
the
american
prize
that
i
was
sent
on
board
of
the
crew
of
the
former
it
appeared
had
been
boasting
among
the
american
prisoners
of
the
they
should
receive
not
you
said
the
yankees
you
will
never
see
your
prize
any
more
nor
any
one
that
went
in
her
these
words
were
repeated
to
the
captain
of
the
frigate
when
he
questioned
the
mate
and
the
crew
and
the
whole
nefarious
transaction
came
out
they
said
the
ship
was
sinking
when
they
left
her
and
that
was
the
reason
they
had
hurried
into
the
boat
the
mate
said
it
was
impossible
to
get
at
the
leaks
which
were
in
the
fore
peak
and
under
the
cabin
deck
in
the
run
that
he
wondered
captain
green
had
not
made
it
known
but
he
supposed
he
must
have
been
drunk
the
ship
continued
the
mate
must
have
gone
down
in
twelve
hours
after
we
left
her
this
was
reported
to
the
admiralty
by
my
captain
and
my
poor
father
was
formally
acquainted
with
the
fatal
story
five
months
had
elapsed
since
i
was
last
heard
of
and
all
hopes
of
my
safety
had
vanished
this
was
the
reason
that
when
i
knocked
at
the
door
i
found
the
servant
in
mourning
he
was
one
who
had
been
hired
since
my
departure
and
did
not
know
me
of
course
he
expressed
no
surprise
at
seeing
me
good
heavens
said
i
who
is
dead
my
master
only
son
sir
said
the
man
mr
frank
drowned
at
sea
oh
is
that
all
said
i
i
am
glad
it
no
worse
the
man
concluded
that
i
was
an
unfeeling
brute
and
stared
stupidly
at
me
as
i
brushed
by
him
and
ran
up
stairs
to
the
i
ought
to
have
been
more
guarded
but
as
usual
i
followed
the
impulse
of
my
feelings
i
opened
the
door
when
i
saw
my
sister
sitting
at
a
table
in
deep
mourning
with
another
young
lady
whose
back
was
turned
towards
me
my
sister
screamed
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
the
other
lady
turned
round
and
i
beheld
my
emily
my
dear
dear
emily
she
too
was
in
deep
mourning
my
sister
after
screaming
fell
on
the
floor
in
a
swoon
emily
instantly
followed
her
example
and
there
they
both
lay
like
two
petrified
queens
in
westminster
abbey
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
pretty
though
a
plague
i
was
confoundedly
frightened
myself
and
thought
i
had
done
a
very
foolish
thing
but
as
i
had
no
time
to
lose
i
rang
the
bell
furiously
and
seeing
some
jars
with
fresh
flowers
in
them
i
caught
them
up
and
poured
plentiful
libations
over
the
faces
and
necks
of
the
young
ladies
but
emily
came
in
for
much
the
largest
share
which
proves
that
i
had
neither
lost
my
presence
of
mind
nor
my
love
for
her
my
sister
maid
higgins
was
the
first
to
answer
the
bell
which
from
its
violent
ringing
announced
some
serious
event
she
came
bouncing
into
the
room
like
a
shot
she
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
i
had
often
kissed
her
when
a
boy
and
she
had
just
as
often
boxed
my
ears
i
used
to
give
her
a
ribbon
to
tie
up
her
jaw
with
telling
her
at
the
same
time
that
she
had
too
much
of
it
this
abigail
like
a
true
lady
maid
seeing
me
whom
she
thought
a
ghost
standing
bolt
upright
and
the
two
ladies
stretched
out
as
she
supposed
dead
gave
a
loud
and
most
interesting
scream
ran
out
of
the
room
for
her
life
nearly
knocking
down
the
footman
whom
she
met
coming
in
this
fellow
who
was
a
country
lout
the
son
of
one
of
my
tenants
only
popped
his
head
into
the
door
and
saw
the
ladies
lying
on
the
carpet
he
had
probably
formed
no
very
good
opinion
of
me
from
the
manner
in
which
i
had
received
the
news
of
my
own
demise
and
seemed
very
much
inclined
to
act
the
part
of
a
mandarin
that
is
nod
his
head
and
stand
still
desire
some
of
the
women
to
come
here
immediately
said
i
some
one
that
can
be
of
use
tell
them
to
bring
salts
eau
de
cologue
any
thing
fly
blockhead
goose
what
do
you
stand
staring
at
the
fellow
looked
at
me
and
then
at
the
supposed
corpses
which
he
must
have
thought
i
had
murdered
and
either
thunderstruck
or
doubting
whether
he
had
any
right
to
obey
me
kept
his
head
inside
the
door
and
his
body
outside
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
pillory
i
saw
that
he
required
some
explanation
and
cried
out
i
am
mr
frank
will
you
obey
me
or
shall
i
throw
this
jar
at
your
head
brandishing
one
of
the
china
vases
had
i
been
inclined
to
have
thrown
it
i
should
have
missed
him
for
the
fellow
was
off
like
a
wounded
porpoise
down
he
ran
to
my
father
in
the
library
oh
sir
good
news
bad
news
good
news
what
news
fool
said
my
father
rising
hastily
from
his
chair
oh
sir
i
do
know
sir
but
i
believe
sir
mr
frank
is
alive
again
and
both
the
ladies
dead
my
poor
father
whose
health
and
constitution
had
not
recovered
the
shock
of
my
supposed
death
tremblingly
leaned
over
his
table
on
which
he
rested
his
two
hands
and
desired
the
man
to
repeat
what
he
had
said
this
the
fellow
did
half
crying
and
my
father
easily
comprehending
the
state
of
things
came
upstairs
i
would
have
flown
into
his
arms
but
mine
were
occupied
in
supporting
my
sweet
emily
while
my
poor
sister
lay
senseless
on
the
other
side
of
me
for
clara
lover
was
not
at
hand
and
she
still
lay
in
abeyance
by
this
time
the
hands
were
turned
up
every
body
was
on
the
alert
and
every
living
creature
in
the
house
not
excepting
the
dog
had
assembled
in
the
the
maids
that
had
known
me
cried
and
sobbed
most
piteously
and
the
new
comer
kept
them
company
from
sympathy
the
coachman
and
footman
and
groom
all
blubbered
and
stared
and
one
brought
water
and
one
a
basin
and
the
looby
of
a
footman
something
else
which
i
must
not
name
but
in
his
hurry
he
had
snatched
up
the
first
utensil
that
he
thought
might
be
of
use
i
approved
of
his
zeal
but
nodded
to
him
to
retire
unluckily
for
him
the
housemaid
perceived
the
mistake
which
his
absence
of
thought
had
led
him
into
and
snatching
the
mysterious
vessel
with
her
left
hand
she
hid
it
under
her
apron
while
with
her
right
she
gave
the
poor
fellow
such
a
slap
on
the
cheek
as
to
bring
to
my
mind
the
tail
of
the
whale
descending
on
the
boat
at
bermuda
you
great
fool
said
she
nobody
wants
that
there
is
matrimony
in
that
slap
said
i
and
the
event
proved
i
was
right
they
were
in
church
the
sunday
following
the
industrious
application
of
salts
cold
water
and
burnt
rags
together
with
chafing
of
temples
opening
of
collars
and
loosening
the
of
the
young
ladies
produced
the
happiest
effects
every
hand
and
every
tongue
was
in
motion
and
with
all
these
remedies
the
eyes
of
the
enchanting
emily
opened
and
beamed
upon
me
spreading
joy
and
gladness
over
the
face
of
creation
like
the
sun
rising
out
of
the
bosom
of
the
atlantic
to
cheer
the
inhabitants
of
the
antilles
after
a
frightful
hurricane
in
half
an
hour
all
was
right
the
guns
were
secured
we
beat
the
retreat
the
servants
retired
i
became
the
centre
of
the
picture
emily
held
my
right
my
father
my
left
dear
clara
hung
round
my
neck
questions
were
put
and
answered
as
fast
as
sobs
and
tears
would
admit
of
their
being
heard
the
interlude
was
filled
up
with
the
sweetest
kisses
from
the
rosiest
of
lips
and
i
was
in
this
half
hour
rewarded
for
all
i
had
suffered
since
i
had
sailed
from
england
in
the
diabolical
brig
for
barbadoes
it
was
i
own
exceedingly
wrong
to
have
taken
the
house
as
it
were
by
storm
when
i
knew
they
were
in
mourning
for
me
but
i
forgot
that
other
people
did
not
require
the
same
stimulus
as
myself
i
begged
pardon
was
kissed
again
and
again
and
forgiven
oh
it
was
worth
while
to
offend
to
be
forgiven
by
such
lips
and
eyes
and
dimples
but
i
am
afraid
this
thought
is
borrowed
from
some
prose
or
poetry
if
so
the
reader
must
forgive
me
and
so
must
the
author
who
may
have
it
again
now
i
have
done
with
it
for
i
shall
never
use
it
any
more
my
narrative
was
given
with
as
much
modesty
and
brevity
as
time
and
circumstances
would
admit
the
coachman
was
despatched
on
one
of
the
best
express
to
mr
somerville
and
the
mail
coach
was
loaded
with
letters
to
all
the
friends
and
connections
of
the
family
this
ended
each
retired
to
dress
for
dinner
what
a
change
had
one
hour
wrought
in
this
house
of
mourning
now
suddenly
turned
into
a
house
of
joy
alas
how
often
is
the
picture
reversed
in
human
life
the
ladies
soon
reappeared
in
spotless
white
emblems
of
their
pure
minds
my
father
had
put
off
his
sables
and
the
servants
came
in
their
usual
liveries
which
were
very
splendid
dinner
being
announced
my
father
handed
off
emily
i
followed
with
my
sister
emily
looking
over
her
shoulder
said
do
be
jealous
frank
my
father
laughed
and
i
vowed
revenge
for
this
little
satirical
hit
you
know
the
forfeit
said
i
and
you
shall
pay
it
i
am
happy
to
say
that
i
am
both
able
and
willing
said
she
and
we
sat
down
to
dinner
but
not
before
my
father
had
given
thanks
in
a
manner
more
than
usually
solemn
and
emphatic
this
essential
act
of
devotion
so
often
neglected
brought
tears
into
the
eyes
of
all
emily
sank
into
her
chair
covered
her
face
with
her
and
relieved
herself
with
tears
clara
did
the
same
my
father
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
said
frank
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
repast
to
what
we
had
yesterday
how
little
did
we
know
of
the
happiness
that
was
in
store
for
us
the
young
ladies
dried
their
eyes
but
had
lost
their
appetites
in
vain
did
emily
endeavour
to
manage
the
tail
of
a
small
smelt
i
filled
a
glass
of
wine
to
each
come
said
i
in
sea
phrase
spirits
are
always
more
easily
stowed
away
than
dry
provisions
let
us
drink
each
other
health
and
then
we
shall
get
on
better
they
took
my
advice
and
it
answered
the
purpose
our
repast
was
cheerful
but
tempered
and
corrected
by
a
feeling
of
past
sorrow
and
a
deep
sense
of
great
mercies
from
heaven
if
heaven
were
every
day
like
this
then
indeed
a
heaven
of
bliss
reader
i
know
you
have
long
thought
me
a
vain
man
a
profligate
unprincipled
don
juan
ready
to
pray
when
in
danger
and
to
sin
when
out
of
it
but
as
i
have
always
told
you
the
truth
even
when
my
honour
and
character
were
at
stake
i
expect
you
will
believe
me
now
when
i
say
a
word
in
my
own
favour
that
i
felt
gratitude
to
god
for
my
deliverance
and
safe
return
i
do
most
solemnly
aver
my
heart
was
ready
to
burst
with
the
escape
of
this
feeling
which
i
suppressed
from
a
false
sense
of
shame
though
i
never
was
given
much
to
the
melting
mood
moreover
i
was
too
proud
to
show
what
i
thought
a
weakness
before
the
great
of
footmen
had
we
been
in
private
i
could
have
fallen
down
on
my
knees
before
that
god
whom
i
had
so
often
offended
who
had
rescued
me
twice
from
the
jaws
of
the
shark
who
had
lifted
me
from
the
depth
of
the
sea
when
darkness
covered
me
who
had
saved
me
from
the
poison
and
the
wreck
and
guided
me
clear
of
the
rock
at
trinidad
and
who
had
sent
the
dog
to
save
me
from
a
horrible
death
these
were
only
a
small
part
of
the
mercies
i
had
received
but
they
were
the
most
recent
and
consequently
had
left
the
deepest
impression
on
my
memory
i
would
have
given
one
of
emily
approving
smiles
much
as
i
valued
them
to
have
been
relieved
from
my
oppressed
feelings
by
a
hearty
flood
of
tears
and
by
a
solemn
act
of
devotion
and
thanksgiving
but
i
felt
all
this
and
that
feeling
i
hope
was
accounted
to
me
for
righteousness
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
the
love
of
god
was
mixed
up
with
a
pure
and
earthly
love
for
emily
and
affection
for
my
family
the
ladies
sat
with
us
some
time
after
the
cloth
was
removed
unable
to
drag
themselves
away
while
i
related
my
escapes
when
i
spoke
of
the
incident
of
trying
to
save
the
poor
man
who
fell
overboard
from
the
brig
of
my
holding
him
by
the
collar
and
being
dragged
down
with
him
until
the
sea
became
dark
over
my
head
emily
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
jumped
up
and
falling
on
her
knees
hid
her
lovely
face
in
my
sister
lap
passionately
exclaiming
oh
do
not
do
not
my
dear
frank
tell
me
any
more
i
can
not
bear
it
indeed
i
can
not
bear
it
we
all
gathered
round
her
and
supported
her
to
the
where
we
diverted
ourselves
with
lighter
and
gayer
anecdotes
emily
tried
a
tune
on
the
pianoforte
and
attempted
a
song
but
it
would
not
do
she
could
not
sing
a
gay
one
and
a
melancholy
one
overpowered
her
at
twelve
we
all
retired
to
our
apartments
and
before
i
slept
i
spent
some
minutes
in
devotion
with
vows
of
amendment
which
i
fully
intended
to
keep
the
next
morning
mr
somerville
joined
us
at
breakfast
this
was
another
trial
of
feeling
for
poor
emily
who
threw
herself
into
her
father
arms
and
sobbed
aloud
mr
somerville
shook
me
most
cordially
by
the
hand
with
both
of
his
and
eagerly
demanded
the
history
of
my
extraordinary
adventures
of
which
i
gave
him
a
small
abridgment
i
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
an
hour
à
with
emily
which
clara
had
considerately
given
us
before
breakfast
to
speak
of
our
anticipated
union
and
finding
there
were
no
other
obstacles
than
those
which
are
usually
raised
by
maiden
pride
and
bashful
coyness
so
natural
so
becoming
and
so
lovely
in
the
sex
i
determined
to
speak
to
the
on
the
subject
to
this
emily
at
last
consented
on
my
reminding
her
of
my
late
narrow
escapes
as
soon
therefore
as
the
ladies
had
retired
from
the
dinner
table
i
asked
my
father
to
fill
a
bumper
to
their
health
and
having
swallowed
mine
in
all
the
fervency
of
the
most
unbounded
love
i
popped
the
question
to
them
both
mr
somerville
and
my
father
looked
at
each
other
when
the
former
said
you
seem
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
frank
not
greater
sir
said
i
than
the
object
deserves
he
bowed
and
my
father
began
i
can
not
say
observed
the
good
old
gentleman
that
i
much
approve
of
matrimony
before
you
are
a
commander
at
least
till
then
you
are
not
your
own
master
oh
if
i
am
to
wait
for
that
sir
said
i
i
may
wait
long
enough
no
man
is
ever
his
own
master
in
our
service
or
in
england
the
captain
is
commanded
by
the
admiral
the
admiral
by
the
admiralty
the
admiralty
by
the
privy
council
the
privy
council
by
the
parliament
the
parliament
by
the
people
and
the
people
by
printers
and
their
devils
i
admire
your
logical
chain
of
causes
and
effects
said
my
father
but
we
must
after
all
go
to
the
at
to
see
if
we
can
not
have
your
shoulders
fitted
with
a
pair
of
epaulettes
when
we
can
see
you
command
your
own
sloop
of
war
i
shall
be
most
happy
as
i
am
sure
my
good
friend
somerville
will
be
also
to
see
you
command
his
daughter
the
finest
and
the
best
girl
in
the
county
of
no
arguments
could
induce
the
two
old
gentlemen
to
bate
one
inch
from
these
qua
it
was
agreed
that
application
should
be
made
to
the
admiralty
forthwith
for
my
promotion
and
when
that
desirable
step
was
obtained
that
then
emily
should
have
the
disposal
of
me
for
the
honeymoon
all
this
was
a
very
pretty
story
for
them
on
the
score
of
prudence
but
it
did
not
suit
the
views
of
an
ardent
lover
of
for
though
i
knew
my
father
influence
was
very
great
at
the
admiralty
i
also
knew
that
an
excellent
regulation
had
recently
been
promulgated
which
prevented
any
lieutenant
being
promoted
to
the
rank
of
commander
until
he
had
served
two
years
at
sea
from
the
date
of
his
first
commission
nor
could
any
commander
in
like
manner
be
promoted
before
he
had
served
one
year
in
that
capacity
all
this
was
no
doubt
very
good
for
the
service
but
i
had
not
yet
attained
sufficient
to
prefer
the
public
to
myself
and
i
fairly
wished
the
regulation
and
the
makers
of
it
in
the
cavern
at
new
providence
just
about
the
time
of
high
water
i
put
it
to
the
ladies
whether
this
was
not
a
case
of
real
distress
after
all
my
hardships
and
my
constancy
to
be
put
off
with
such
an
excuse
the
answer
from
the
admiralty
was
so
far
favourable
that
i
was
assured
i
should
be
promoted
as
soon
as
my
time
was
served
of
which
i
then
wanted
two
months
i
was
appointed
to
a
ship
fitting
at
woolwich
and
before
she
could
be
ready
for
sea
my
time
would
be
completed
and
i
was
to
have
my
commission
as
a
commander
this
was
not
the
way
to
ensure
her
speedy
equipment
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
as
the
ship
was
at
woolwich
and
the
residence
of
my
fair
one
at
no
great
distance
i
endeavoured
to
pass
my
time
during
the
interval
between
the
duties
of
love
and
war
between
obedience
to
my
captain
and
obedience
to
my
mistress
and
by
great
good
fortune
i
contrived
to
please
both
for
my
captain
gave
himself
no
trouble
about
the
ship
or
her
equipment
before
i
proceeded
to
join
i
made
one
more
effort
to
break
through
the
inflexibility
of
my
father
i
said
i
had
undergone
the
labours
of
hercules
and
that
if
i
went
again
on
foreign
service
i
might
meet
with
some
young
lady
who
would
send
me
out
of
the
world
with
a
cup
of
poison
or
by
some
fatal
spell
break
the
magical
chain
which
now
bound
me
to
emily
this
poetical
imagery
had
no
more
effect
on
them
than
my
prose
composition
i
then
appealed
to
emily
herself
surely
said
i
your
heart
is
not
as
hard
as
those
of
our
inflexible
parents
surely
you
will
be
my
advocate
on
this
occasion
bend
but
one
look
of
disapprobation
on
my
father
with
those
heavenly
blue
eyes
of
yours
and
on
my
life
he
will
strike
his
flag
but
the
gipsy
replied
with
a
smile
instigated
no
doubt
from
that
she
did
not
like
the
idea
of
her
name
appearing
in
the
as
the
bride
of
a
lieutenant
what
a
lieutenant
said
she
nobody
i
remember
when
i
was
on
a
visit
at
fareham
i
used
to
go
to
portsmouth
to
see
the
and
the
ships
and
there
was
your
great
friend
the
tall
admiral
sir
hurricane
humbug
i
think
you
call
him
driving
the
poor
lieutenants
about
like
so
many
sheep
before
a
dog
there
was
one
always
at
his
heels
like
a
running
footman
and
there
was
another
that
appeared
to
me
to
be
chained
like
a
mastiff
to
the
door
of
the
admiral
office
except
when
the
admiral
and
family
walked
out
and
then
he
brought
up
the
rear
with
the
governess
no
frank
i
shall
not
surrender
at
discretion
with
all
my
charms
to
any
thing
less
than
a
captain
with
a
pair
of
gold
epaulettes
very
well
replied
i
looking
into
the
pier
glass
with
tolerable
if
you
choose
to
pin
your
happiness
on
the
promises
of
a
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
and
a
pair
of
epaulettes
i
can
say
no
more
there
is
no
accounting
for
female
taste
some
ladies
prefer
gold
lace
and
wrinkles
to
youth
and
beauty
i
am
sorry
for
them
that
all
frank
said
emily
you
must
acknowledge
that
you
are
vain
enough
to
be
an
admiral
at
least
the
admirals
are
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
compliment
said
i
i
trust
i
should
not
disgrace
the
flag
come
when
it
will
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
dear
emily
i
can
not
say
i
look
forward
to
that
elevation
with
any
degree
of
satisfaction
three
stars
on
each
shoulder
and
three
rows
of
gold
lace
round
the
cuff
are
no
compensation
in
my
eyes
for
grey
hairs
thin
legs
a
broken
back
a
cough
and
to
be
laughed
at
or
pitied
by
all
the
pretty
girls
in
the
country
into
the
bargain
i
am
sorry
for
you
my
hero
said
the
young
lady
but
you
must
submit
well
then
if
i
must
i
must
said
i
but
give
me
a
kiss
in
the
meantime
i
asked
for
one
and
took
a
hundred
and
should
have
taken
a
hundred
more
but
the
confounded
butler
came
in
and
brought
me
a
letter
on
service
which
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
an
order
to
join
my
ship
forthwith
pocketing
my
disappointment
with
as
much
as
i
could
muster
i
continued
to
beguile
the
time
and
to
solace
myself
for
my
past
sufferings
by
as
much
enjoyment
as
could
be
compressed
into
the
small
space
of
leisure
time
allotted
to
me
fortunately
the
first
lieutenant
of
the
frigate
was
what
we
used
to
call
a
hard
officer
he
never
went
on
shore
because
he
had
few
friends
and
less
money
he
drew
for
his
pay
on
the
day
it
became
due
and
it
lasted
till
the
next
day
of
payment
and
as
i
found
he
doated
on
a
spanish
cigar
and
a
glass
of
cognac
grog
for
he
never
drank
to
excess
i
presented
him
with
a
box
of
the
former
and
a
dozen
of
the
latter
to
enable
him
to
bear
my
nightly
absence
with
christian
composure
as
soon
as
the
day
work
was
ended
the
lieutenant
used
to
say
come
mr
mildmay
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
in
love
i
was
once
in
love
myself
though
it
is
a
good
many
years
ago
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
get
into
the
good
graces
of
your
polly
for
so
he
called
emily
if
i
send
you
to
her
arms
there
is
the
jolly
for
you
send
the
boat
off
as
soon
as
you
have
landed
and
be
with
us
at
nine
morning
to
meet
the
midshipman
and
the
working
party
in
the
all
this
was
perfectly
agreeable
to
me
i
generally
got
to
mr
somerville
temporary
residence
on
blackheath
by
the
time
the
rang
and
never
failed
to
meet
a
pleasant
party
at
dinner
my
father
and
dear
clara
were
guests
in
the
house
as
well
as
myself
by
mr
somerville
kind
permission
i
introduced
talbot
who
being
a
perfect
gentleman
in
his
manners
a
man
of
sound
sense
good
education
and
high
aristocratic
connections
i
was
proud
to
call
my
friend
i
presented
him
particularly
to
my
sister
and
took
an
opportunity
of
whispering
in
emily
ear
where
i
knew
it
would
not
long
remain
that
he
possessed
the
indispensable
qualification
of
two
epaulettes
therefore
said
i
pray
do
not
trust
yourself
too
near
him
for
fear
you
should
be
taken
by
surprise
like
the
talbot
knowing
that
emily
was
bespoken
paid
her
no
more
than
the
common
attentions
which
courtesy
demands
but
to
clara
his
demeanour
was
very
different
and
her
natural
attractions
were
much
enhanced
in
his
eyes
by
the
friendship
which
we
had
entertained
for
each
other
ever
since
the
memorable
affair
of
swimming
away
from
the
ship
at
spithead
from
that
time
he
used
jocularly
to
call
me
leander
but
before
i
proceed
any
further
with
this
part
of
my
history
i
must
beg
leave
to
detain
the
reader
one
minute
only
while
i
attempt
to
make
a
sketch
of
my
dear
little
sister
clara
she
was
rather
fair
with
a
fine
small
oval
face
sparkling
black
and
speaking
eyes
good
teeth
pretty
red
lips
very
dark
hair
and
plenty
of
it
hanging
over
her
face
and
neck
in
curls
of
every
size
her
arms
and
bust
were
such
as
phidias
and
praxiteles
might
have
copied
her
waist
was
slender
her
hands
and
feet
small
and
beautiful
i
used
often
to
think
it
was
a
great
pity
that
such
a
love
as
she
was
should
not
be
matched
with
some
equally
good
specimen
of
our
sex
and
i
had
long
fixed
on
my
friend
talbot
as
the
person
best
adapted
to
command
this
pretty
little
tight
smack
unluckily
clara
with
all
her
charms
had
one
fault
and
that
in
my
eyes
was
a
very
serious
one
clara
did
not
love
a
sailor
the
soldiers
she
doated
on
but
clara
predilections
were
not
easily
overcome
and
that
which
had
once
taken
root
grew
up
and
flourished
she
fancied
sailors
were
not
well
bred
that
they
thought
too
much
of
themselves
or
their
ships
and
in
short
that
they
were
as
rough
and
unpolished
as
they
were
conceited
with
such
obstinate
and
prejudices
against
all
of
our
profession
it
proved
no
small
share
of
merit
in
talbot
to
overcome
them
but
as
clara
love
for
the
army
was
more
general
than
particular
talbot
had
a
vacant
theatre
to
fight
in
he
began
by
handing
her
to
dinner
and
with
modest
assurance
seated
himself
by
her
side
but
so
well
was
he
aware
of
her
failing
that
he
never
once
alluded
to
our
unfortunate
element
on
the
contrary
he
led
her
away
with
every
variety
of
topic
which
he
found
best
suited
to
her
taste
so
that
she
was
at
last
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
he
might
be
one
exception
to
her
rule
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
hoping
that
i
might
be
another
one
day
at
dinner
talbot
called
me
leander
which
instantly
attracted
the
notice
of
the
ladies
and
an
explanation
was
demanded
but
for
a
time
it
was
evaded
and
the
subject
changed
emily
however
joining
together
certain
imperfect
reports
which
had
reached
her
ears
through
the
kindness
of
some
friends
of
the
family
began
to
suspect
a
rival
and
the
next
morning
examined
me
so
closely
on
the
subject
that
fearing
a
disclosure
from
other
quarters
i
was
compelled
to
make
a
confession
i
told
her
the
whole
history
of
my
acquaintance
with
eugenia
of
my
last
interview
and
of
her
mysterious
departure
i
did
not
even
omit
the
circumstance
of
her
offering
me
money
but
i
concealed
the
probability
of
her
being
a
mother
i
assured
her
that
it
was
full
four
years
and
a
half
since
we
had
met
and
that
as
she
knew
of
my
engagement
it
was
unlikely
we
should
ever
meet
again
at
any
rate
i
said
i
shall
never
seek
her
and
if
accident
should
throw
me
in
her
way
i
trust
i
shall
behave
like
a
man
of
honour
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
inform
her
of
the
fired
at
me
by
order
of
talbot
as
that
might
have
injured
him
in
the
estimation
of
both
emily
and
clara
when
i
had
concluded
my
narrative
emily
sighed
and
looked
very
grave
i
asked
her
if
she
had
forgiven
me
conditionally
said
she
as
you
said
to
the
mutineers
chapter
xxiii
in
all
states
of
europe
there
are
a
set
of
men
who
assume
from
their
infancy
a
independent
of
their
moral
character
the
attention
paid
to
them
from
the
moment
of
their
birth
gives
them
the
idea
that
they
are
formed
for
command
and
they
soon
learn
to
consider
themselves
a
distinct
species
and
being
secure
of
a
certain
rank
and
station
take
no
pains
to
makes
themselves
worthy
of
raynal
it
is
now
time
to
make
my
reader
acquainted
with
my
new
ship
and
new
captain
the
first
was
a
frigate
of
the
largest
class
built
on
purpose
to
cope
with
the
large
frigates
of
the
yankees
she
carried
thirty
long
pounders
on
her
main
deck
and
the
same
number
of
pound
carronades
on
her
and
forecastle
i
had
been
a
week
on
board
doing
duty
during
the
day
and
flirting
on
shore
at
mr
somerville
at
blackheath
during
the
evening
i
had
seen
no
captain
yet
and
the
first
lieutenant
had
gone
on
shore
one
morning
to
stretch
his
legs
i
was
commanding
officer
the
people
were
all
at
their
dinner
it
was
a
drizzling
soft
rain
and
i
was
walking
the
by
myself
when
a
came
alongside
with
a
person
in
plain
clothes
i
paid
him
no
attention
supposing
him
to
be
a
wine
merchant
or
a
come
to
ask
permission
to
serve
the
ship
the
stranger
looked
at
the
dirty
which
the
held
off
to
him
and
inquired
if
there
was
not
a
clean
pair
the
lad
replied
in
the
negative
and
the
stranger
perceiving
there
was
no
remedy
took
hold
of
the
dirty
ropes
and
ascended
the
side
reaching
the
he
come
up
to
me
and
showing
a
pair
of
gloves
bedaubed
with
tar
and
dirt
angrily
observed
by
g
sir
i
have
spoiled
a
new
pair
of
gloves
i
always
take
my
gloves
off
when
i
come
up
the
side
said
i
but
i
choose
to
keep
mine
on
said
the
stranger
and
why
could
not
i
have
had
a
pair
of
clean
ropes
because
said
i
my
orders
are
only
to
give
them
when
the
side
is
piped
and
why
was
not
the
side
piped
for
me
sir
because
sir
we
never
pipe
the
side
until
we
know
who
it
is
for
as
sure
as
i
shall
sit
in
the
house
of
peers
i
will
report
you
to
your
captain
for
this
said
he
we
only
pipe
the
side
for
officers
in
uniform
said
i
and
i
am
yet
to
learn
by
what
right
you
demand
that
honour
i
am
sir
said
he
showing
his
card
do
you
know
me
now
yes
sir
said
i
as
a
gentleman
but
until
i
see
you
in
a
captain
uniform
i
can
not
give
you
the
honours
you
demand
as
i
said
this
i
touched
my
hat
respectfully
then
sir
said
he
as
sure
as
i
shall
sit
in
the
house
of
peers
i
shall
let
you
know
more
of
this
and
having
asked
whether
the
captain
was
on
board
and
received
an
answer
in
the
negative
he
turned
round
and
went
down
the
side
into
his
boat
without
giving
me
an
opportunity
of
supplying
him
with
a
pair
of
clean
ropes
he
pulled
away
for
the
shore
and
i
never
heard
any
thing
more
of
the
dirty
ropes
and
soiled
gloves
this
officer
i
afterwards
learned
was
in
the
habit
of
interlarding
his
discourse
with
this
darling
object
of
his
ambition
but
as
he
is
now
a
member
of
the
upper
house
it
is
to
be
supposed
he
has
exchanged
the
affidavit
for
some
other
while
he
commanded
a
ship
he
used
to
say
as
sure
as
i
shall
sit
in
the
house
of
peers
i
will
flog
you
my
man
and
when
this
denunciation
had
passed
his
lips
the
punishment
was
never
remitted
with
us
the
reverse
of
this
became
our
lieutenants
midshipmen
sailors
and
marines
asserted
their
claim
to
veracity
by
saying
as
sure
as
i
shall
sit
in
the
house
of
peers
this
was
the
noble
lord
who
when
in
the
command
of
one
of
his
majesty
ships
in
china
employed
a
native
of
that
country
to
take
his
portrait
the
resemblance
not
having
been
flattering
the
artist
was
sharply
rebuked
by
his
patron
the
poor
man
replied
ai
awe
master
how
can
handsome
face
make
if
handsome
face
no
have
got
this
story
has
like
many
other
good
stories
been
pirated
and
applied
to
other
cases
but
i
claim
it
as
the
legitimate
property
of
the
navy
and
can
vouch
for
its
origin
as
i
have
related
my
messmates
dropped
in
one
after
another
until
our
number
was
completed
and
at
length
a
note
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
the
first
lieutenant
on
service
and
marked
on
the
lower
left
hand
corner
with
the
name
of
the
noble
writer
announced
that
our
captain
would
make
his
appearance
on
the
following
day
we
were
of
course
prepared
to
receive
him
in
our
full
uniforms
with
our
cocked
hats
and
swords
with
the
marine
guard
under
arms
he
came
alongside
at
twelve
when
the
men
were
at
dinner
an
unusual
hour
to
select
as
it
is
not
the
custom
ever
to
disturb
them
at
their
meals
if
it
can
be
avoided
he
appeared
in
a
sort
of
undress
frock
coat
fall
down
collar
anchor
buttons
no
epaulettes
and
a
lancer
cap
with
a
broad
gold
band
this
was
not
correct
but
as
he
was
a
lord
he
claimed
privilege
and
on
this
rock
of
privilege
we
found
afterwards
that
he
always
perched
himself
on
every
occasion
we
were
all
presented
to
him
and
to
each
he
condescended
to
give
a
nod
his
questions
were
all
confined
to
the
first
lieutenant
and
all
related
to
his
own
comforts
where
is
my
steward
to
lie
where
is
my
valet
to
sleep
where
is
my
and
where
are
my
sheep
to
be
we
discovered
when
he
had
been
one
hour
in
our
company
that
his
noble
self
was
the
god
of
his
idolatry
as
for
the
details
of
the
ship
and
her
crew
masts
rigging
stowage
provisions
the
water
she
would
carry
and
how
much
she
drew
they
were
subjects
on
which
he
never
fatigued
his
mind
one
hour
having
expired
since
he
had
come
on
board
he
ordered
his
boat
and
returned
to
the
shore
and
we
saw
no
more
of
him
until
we
arrived
at
spithead
when
his
lordship
came
on
board
accompanied
by
a
person
whom
we
soon
discovered
was
a
half
pay
purser
in
the
navy
a
man
who
by
dint
of
the
grossest
flattery
and
numerous
little
attentions
had
so
completely
ingratiated
himself
with
his
patron
that
he
had
become
as
necessary
an
appendage
to
the
travelling
equipage
as
the
portmanteau
or
the
this
despicable
toady
was
his
lordship
double
he
was
a
living
type
of
the
gnatho
of
terence
and
i
never
saw
him
without
remembering
the
passage
that
ends
negat
id
quoque
black
was
white
and
white
was
black
with
toady
if
his
lordship
pleased
he
messed
in
the
cabin
did
much
mischief
in
the
ship
and
only
escaped
kicking
because
he
was
too
contemptible
to
be
kicked
my
fair
readers
are
no
doubt
anxious
to
know
how
i
parted
with
emily
and
truly
i
am
not
unwilling
to
oblige
them
though
it
is
indeed
a
tender
subject
as
soon
as
we
received
our
orders
to
proceed
to
spithead
mr
somerville
who
had
kept
his
house
at
blackheath
while
the
ship
was
fitting
in
hopes
that
my
promotion
might
have
taken
place
before
she
was
ready
now
prepared
to
quit
the
place
to
the
renewed
application
of
my
father
the
answer
was
that
i
must
go
abroad
for
my
promotion
this
at
once
decided
him
to
break
up
his
summer
quarters
very
wisely
foreseeing
that
unless
he
did
so
my
services
would
be
lost
to
my
ship
and
if
he
and
emily
did
not
leave
me
behind
at
woolwich
i
should
probably
be
left
behind
by
my
captain
he
therefore
announced
his
intended
departure
within
hours
emily
was
very
sorry
and
so
was
i
kindly
reproached
her
with
her
cruelty
but
she
replied
with
a
degree
of
firmness
and
good
sense
which
i
could
not
but
admire
that
she
had
but
one
counsellor
and
that
was
her
father
and
that
until
she
was
married
she
never
intended
to
have
any
other
that
by
his
advice
she
had
delayed
the
union
and
as
we
were
neither
of
us
very
old
people
i
trust
in
god
said
she
we
may
meet
again
i
admired
her
heroism
gave
her
one
kiss
handed
her
into
her
carriage
and
we
shook
hands
i
need
not
say
i
saw
a
tear
or
two
in
her
eyes
mr
somerville
saw
the
shower
coming
on
pulled
up
the
glass
gave
me
a
friendly
nod
and
the
carriage
drove
off
the
last
i
saw
of
emily
at
that
time
was
her
right
hand
which
carried
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
after
the
dear
inmates
were
gone
i
turned
from
the
door
of
the
house
in
disgust
and
ran
direct
to
my
boat
like
a
dog
with
a
when
i
got
on
board
i
hated
the
sight
of
every
body
and
the
smell
of
every
thing
pitch
paint
tar
and
rum
entering
into
horrible
combination
had
conspired
against
me
and
i
was
as
sick
and
as
miserable
as
the
most
seaman
can
conceive
i
have
before
observed
that
we
had
arrived
at
spithead
and
as
i
have
nothing
new
to
say
of
that
place
i
shall
proceed
to
sea
we
sailed
for
the
north
american
station
the
pleasantest
i
could
go
to
when
away
from
emily
our
passage
was
tedious
and
we
were
put
on
short
allowance
of
water
those
only
who
have
known
it
will
understand
it
all
felt
it
but
the
captain
who
claiming
privilege
took
a
dozen
gallons
every
day
to
bathe
his
feet
in
and
that
water
when
done
with
was
greedily
sought
for
by
the
men
there
was
some
murmuring
about
it
which
came
to
the
captain
ears
who
only
observed
with
an
apathy
peculiar
to
almack
well
you
know
if
a
man
has
no
privilege
what
the
use
of
being
a
captain
very
true
my
lord
said
the
with
a
low
bow
i
will
now
give
a
short
description
of
his
lordship
he
was
a
smart
dapper
well
made
man
with
a
handsome
but
not
an
intellectual
countenance
cleanly
and
particular
in
his
person
and
assisted
by
the
puffs
of
toady
had
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
proud
of
his
aristocratic
birth
and
still
more
vain
of
his
personal
appearance
his
knowledge
on
most
points
was
superficial
high
life
and
anecdotes
connected
with
it
were
the
usual
topics
of
his
discourse
at
his
own
table
he
generally
engrossed
all
the
conversation
and
while
his
guests
drank
his
wine
they
laughed
with
counterfeited
glee
his
reading
was
comprised
in
two
volumes
octavo
being
the
memoirs
of
the
count
de
grammont
which
amusing
and
aristocratical
work
was
never
out
of
his
hand
he
had
been
many
years
at
sea
but
strange
to
say
knew
nothing
literally
nothing
of
his
profession
seamanship
navigation
and
every
thing
connected
with
the
service
he
was
perfectly
ignorant
of
i
had
heard
him
spoken
of
as
a
good
officer
before
he
joined
us
and
i
must
in
justice
to
him
say
that
he
was
naturally
good
tempered
and
i
believe
as
brave
a
man
as
ever
drew
a
sword
he
seldom
made
any
professional
remark
being
aware
of
his
deficiency
and
never
ventured
beyond
his
depth
intentionally
when
he
came
on
the
he
usually
looked
at
the
weather
and
if
it
was
not
as
as
a
bar
would
order
it
to
be
made
so
here
he
could
not
easily
commit
himself
but
it
became
a
with
us
when
we
laughed
at
him
below
he
had
a
curious
way
of
forgetting
or
pretending
to
forget
the
names
of
men
and
things
i
presume
because
they
were
so
much
beneath
him
and
in
their
stead
substituted
the
elegant
phrases
of
and
thingumbob
one
day
he
came
on
deck
and
actually
gave
me
the
following
very
intelligible
order
mr
have
the
goodness
to
the
the
thingumbob
ay
ay
my
lord
said
i
afterguard
haul
taut
the
weather
this
was
exactly
what
he
meant
he
was
very
particular
and
captious
when
not
properly
addressed
when
an
order
is
given
by
a
commanding
officer
it
is
not
unusual
to
say
very
good
sir
implying
that
you
perfectly
understand
and
are
going
cheerfully
to
obey
it
i
had
adopted
this
answer
and
gave
it
to
his
lordship
when
i
received
an
order
from
him
saying
very
good
my
lord
mr
mildmay
said
his
lordship
i
do
suppose
you
mean
anything
like
disrespect
but
i
will
thank
you
not
to
make
that
answer
again
it
is
for
to
say
good
and
not
you
you
seem
to
approve
of
my
order
and
i
do
like
it
i
beg
you
will
not
do
it
again
you
know
very
good
my
lord
said
i
so
inveterate
is
habit
i
beg
your
lordship
pardon
i
mean
very
well
i
do
much
like
that
young
man
said
his
lordship
to
his
toady
who
followed
him
up
and
down
the
like
the
cur
looking
his
master
in
the
face
i
did
not
hear
the
answer
but
of
course
it
was
an
echo
the
first
time
we
reefed
topsails
at
sea
the
captain
was
on
deck
he
said
nothing
but
merely
looked
on
the
second
time
we
found
he
had
caught
all
the
words
of
the
first
lieutenant
and
repeated
them
in
a
loud
and
pompous
voice
without
knowing
whether
they
were
applicable
to
the
case
or
not
the
third
time
he
fancied
he
was
able
to
go
alone
and
down
he
fell
he
made
a
sad
mistake
indeed
hoist
away
the
said
the
first
lieutenant
hoist
away
the
said
the
captain
the
men
were
stamping
aft
and
the
topsail
yards
travelling
up
to
the
very
fast
when
they
were
stopped
by
a
sudden
check
with
the
what
the
matter
said
the
first
lieutenant
calling
to
me
who
was
at
my
station
on
the
forecastle
something
foul
of
the
i
replied
what
the
matter
forward
said
the
captain
is
foul
my
lord
answered
the
first
lieutenant
d
n
the
cut
it
away
out
knife
there
aloft
i
have
the
topsail
hoisted
cut
away
the
for
the
information
of
my
land
readers
i
should
observe
that
the
was
the
very
rope
which
was
at
that
moment
suspending
the
yard
aloft
the
cutting
it
would
have
disabled
the
ship
until
it
could
have
been
repaired
and
had
the
order
been
obeyed
the
itself
would
in
all
probability
have
been
sprung
or
broke
in
two
on
the
cap
we
arrived
at
halifax
without
falling
in
with
an
enemy
and
as
soon
as
the
ship
was
secured
i
went
on
shore
to
visit
all
my
dear
dulcineas
every
one
of
whom
i
persuaded
that
on
her
account
alone
i
had
used
my
utmost
interest
to
be
sent
out
on
the
station
fortunately
for
them
and
for
me
i
was
not
long
permitted
to
trifle
away
my
time
we
were
ordered
to
cruise
on
the
coast
of
north
america
it
was
winter
and
very
cold
we
encountered
many
severe
gales
of
wind
during
which
time
we
suffered
much
from
the
frequent
and
sudden
snowstorms
gales
and
sharp
frosts
which
rendered
our
almost
unmanageable
and
obliged
us
to
pour
boiling
water
into
the
sheaves
of
the
blocks
to
thaw
them
and
allow
the
ropes
to
traverse
nor
did
the
cold
permit
the
captain
to
honour
us
with
his
presence
on
deck
more
than
once
in
the
hours
we
anchored
off
a
part
of
the
coast
which
was
not
in
a
state
of
defence
and
the
people
being
unprotected
by
their
own
government
considered
themselves
as
neutrals
and
supplied
us
with
as
much
fish
poultry
and
vegetables
as
we
required
while
we
lay
here
the
captain
and
officers
frequently
went
on
shore
for
a
short
time
without
molestation
one
night
after
the
captain
had
returned
a
and
a
gale
of
wind
came
on
the
captain
gig
which
ought
to
have
been
hoisted
up
was
not
she
broke
her
painter
and
went
adrift
and
had
been
gone
some
time
before
she
was
missed
the
next
morning
on
making
inquiry
it
was
found
that
the
boat
had
drifted
on
shore
a
few
miles
from
where
we
lay
and
that
having
been
taken
possession
of
by
the
americans
they
had
removed
her
to
a
hostile
part
of
the
coast
miles
off
the
captain
was
very
much
annoyed
at
the
loss
of
his
boat
which
he
considered
as
his
own
private
property
although
built
on
board
by
the
king
men
and
with
the
king
plank
and
nails
as
my
private
property
said
his
lordship
it
ought
to
be
given
up
you
know
i
did
not
tell
him
that
i
had
seen
the
sawyers
cutting
an
into
the
plank
of
which
it
was
built
and
that
the
said
plank
had
been
put
down
to
other
services
in
the
this
however
was
no
business
of
mine
nor
had
i
any
idea
that
the
loss
of
this
little
boat
would
so
nearly
produce
my
final
catastrophe
so
it
was
however
and
very
serious
results
took
place
in
consequence
of
this
accident
they
respect
private
property
you
know
said
the
captain
to
the
first
lieutenant
yes
answered
the
lieutenant
but
they
do
not
know
that
it
is
private
property
very
true
then
i
will
send
and
tell
them
so
and
down
he
went
to
his
dinner
the
yawl
was
ordered
to
be
got
ready
and
hoisted
out
at
daylight
and
i
had
notice
given
me
that
i
was
to
go
away
in
her
about
nine
the
next
morning
i
was
sent
for
into
the
cabin
his
lordship
was
still
in
bed
and
the
green
silk
curtains
were
drawn
close
round
his
cot
mr
thingamy
said
his
lordship
you
will
take
the
you
know
yes
my
lord
said
i
and
you
will
go
to
that
town
and
ask
for
my
thingumbob
for
your
gig
my
lord
said
i
yes
that
all
but
my
lord
suppose
they
wo
give
it
to
me
then
take
it
suppose
the
gig
is
not
there
my
lord
and
if
there
suppose
they
refuse
to
give
it
up
then
take
every
vessel
out
of
the
harbour
very
well
my
lord
am
i
to
put
the
gun
in
the
boat
or
to
take
muskets
only
oh
no
no
arms
take
a
flag
of
truce
no
white
flag
will
do
suppose
they
will
not
accept
the
flag
of
truce
my
lord
oh
but
they
will
they
always
respect
a
flag
of
truce
you
know
i
beg
your
lordship
pardon
but
i
think
a
few
muskets
in
the
boat
would
be
of
service
no
no
no
no
arms
you
will
be
fighting
about
nothing
you
have
your
orders
sir
yes
thinks
i
i
have
if
i
succeed
i
am
a
robber
if
i
fail
i
am
liable
to
be
hanged
on
the
first
tree
i
left
the
cabin
and
went
to
the
first
lieutenant
i
told
him
what
my
orders
were
this
officer
was
as
i
before
observed
a
man
who
had
no
friends
and
was
therefore
entirely
dependent
on
the
captain
for
his
promotion
and
was
afraid
to
act
contrary
to
his
lordship
orders
however
absurd
i
told
him
that
whatever
might
me
the
orders
i
would
not
go
without
arms
the
orders
of
his
lordship
must
be
obeyed
said
the
lieutenant
why
said
i
irritated
at
his
folly
you
are
as
clever
a
fellow
as
the
skipper
this
he
considered
so
great
an
affront
that
he
ran
down
to
his
cabin
saying
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
for
this
sir
i
concluded
that
he
meant
to
try
me
by
a
to
which
i
had
certainly
laid
myself
open
by
this
unguarded
expression
but
i
went
on
the
and
during
his
absence
got
as
many
muskets
into
the
boat
as
i
wanted
with
a
proper
proportion
of
ammunition
this
was
hardly
completed
before
the
lieutenant
came
up
again
and
put
a
letter
into
my
hands
which
was
no
more
than
the
very
comfortable
intelligence
that
on
my
return
from
the
expedition
on
which
i
was
then
going
he
should
expect
satisfaction
for
the
affront
i
had
offered
him
i
was
glad
however
to
find
it
was
no
worse
i
laughed
at
his
threat
and
as
the
very
head
and
front
of
my
offending
was
only
having
compared
him
to
the
captain
he
could
not
show
any
resentment
openly
for
fear
of
displeasing
his
patron
in
short
to
be
offended
at
it
was
to
offer
the
greatest
possible
affront
to
the
man
he
looked
up
to
for
promotion
and
thus
destroy
all
his
golden
prospects
as
i
put
this
challenge
into
my
pocket
i
walked
down
the
side
got
into
my
boat
and
put
off
it
wanted
but
one
hour
of
sunset
when
i
reached
the
part
where
this
infernal
gig
was
supposed
to
be
and
the
sky
gave
strong
indications
of
an
approaching
gale
indeed
i
do
not
believe
another
captain
in
the
navy
could
have
been
found
who
at
such
a
season
of
the
year
would
have
risked
a
boat
so
far
from
the
ship
on
an
enemy
coast
and
a
for
such
a
worthless
object
my
crew
consisted
of
twenty
men
and
a
midshipman
when
we
arrived
off
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
we
perceived
four
vessels
lying
at
anchor
and
pulled
directly
in
we
had
however
no
opportunity
of
trying
our
flag
of
truce
for
as
soon
as
we
came
within
range
of
a
volley
from
two
hundred
concealed
militiamen
struck
down
four
of
my
men
there
was
then
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
board
and
bring
out
the
vessels
two
of
them
were
aground
and
we
set
them
on
fire
it
being
dead
low
water
thanks
to
the
delay
in
the
morning
in
doing
this
we
had
more
men
wounded
i
then
took
possession
of
the
other
two
vessels
and
giving
one
of
them
in
charge
of
the
midshipman
who
was
quite
a
lad
i
desired
him
to
weigh
his
anchor
i
gave
him
the
boat
with
all
the
men
except
four
which
i
kept
with
me
the
poor
fellow
probably
lost
more
men
for
he
cut
his
cable
and
got
out
before
me
i
weighed
my
anchor
but
had
one
of
my
men
killed
by
a
musket
ball
in
doing
it
i
stood
out
after
the
midshipman
we
had
gained
an
offing
of
four
miles
when
a
violent
gale
and
came
on
the
sails
belonging
to
the
vessel
all
blew
to
rags
immediately
being
very
old
i
had
no
resource
except
to
anchor
which
i
did
on
a
bank
in
five
fathom
water
the
other
vessel
lost
all
her
sails
and
having
no
anchor
as
i
then
conjectured
and
afterwards
learned
drifted
on
shore
and
was
dashed
to
pieces
the
people
being
either
frozen
to
death
wounded
or
taken
prisoners
the
next
morning
i
could
see
the
vessel
lying
on
shore
a
wreck
covered
with
ice
a
dismal
prospect
to
me
as
at
that
time
i
knew
not
what
had
become
of
the
men
my
own
situation
was
even
less
enviable
the
vessel
was
frail
and
deeply
laden
with
salt
a
cargo
which
if
it
by
any
means
gets
wet
is
worse
than
water
since
it
can
not
be
pumped
out
and
becomes
as
heavy
as
lead
nothing
could
in
that
event
have
kept
the
vessel
afloat
and
we
had
no
boat
in
case
of
such
an
accident
i
had
three
men
with
me
besides
the
dead
body
in
the
cabin
and
a
pantry
as
clear
as
an
empty
house
not
an
article
of
any
description
to
eat
i
was
four
miles
from
the
shore
in
a
heavy
gale
of
wind
the
pleasure
of
which
was
enhanced
by
snow
and
the
bitterest
cold
i
ever
experienced
we
proceeded
to
examine
the
vessel
and
found
that
there
was
on
board
a
quantity
of
sails
and
canvas
that
did
not
fit
but
had
been
bought
with
an
intention
of
making
up
for
this
vessel
and
not
before
she
wanted
them
there
was
also
an
abundance
of
palms
needles
and
twine
but
to
eat
there
was
nothing
except
salt
and
to
drink
nothing
but
one
cask
of
fresh
water
we
kindled
a
fire
in
the
cabin
and
made
ourselves
as
warm
as
we
could
taking
a
view
on
deck
now
and
then
to
see
if
she
drove
or
if
the
gale
abated
she
pitched
heavily
taking
in
whole
seas
over
the
forecastle
and
the
water
froze
on
the
deck
the
next
morning
we
found
we
had
drifted
a
mile
nearer
to
the
shore
and
the
gale
continued
with
unabated
violence
the
other
vessel
lay
a
wreck
with
her
masts
gone
and
as
it
were
staring
us
in
the
face
we
felt
the
most
pinching
hunger
we
had
no
fuel
after
the
second
day
except
what
we
pulled
down
from
the
bulkheads
of
the
cabin
we
amused
ourselves
below
making
a
suit
of
sails
for
the
vessel
and
drinking
hot
water
to
repel
the
cold
but
this
work
could
not
have
lasted
long
the
weather
became
more
intensely
cold
and
twice
did
we
set
the
prize
on
fire
in
our
liberality
with
the
stove
to
keep
ourselves
warm
the
ice
formed
on
the
surface
of
the
water
in
our
kettle
till
it
was
dissolved
by
the
heat
from
the
bottom
the
second
night
passed
like
the
first
and
we
found
in
the
morning
that
we
had
drifted
within
two
miles
of
the
shore
we
completed
our
little
sails
this
day
and
with
great
difficulty
contrived
to
bend
them
the
men
were
now
exhausted
with
cold
and
hunger
and
proposed
that
we
should
cut
our
cable
and
run
on
shore
but
i
begged
them
to
wait
till
the
next
morning
as
these
gales
seldom
lasted
long
this
they
agreed
to
and
we
again
huddled
together
to
keep
ourselves
warm
the
outside
man
pulling
the
dead
man
close
to
him
by
way
of
a
blanket
the
gale
this
night
moderated
and
towards
the
morning
the
weather
was
fine
although
the
wind
was
against
us
and
to
beat
her
up
to
the
ship
was
impossible
from
the
continued
freezing
of
the
water
the
and
the
rigging
were
coated
with
ice
five
or
six
inches
thick
and
the
forecastle
was
covered
with
two
feet
of
clear
ice
showing
the
ropes
coiled
underneath
it
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
so
desiring
the
men
to
cut
the
cable
i
made
up
my
mind
to
run
the
vessel
on
shore
and
give
myself
up
we
hoisted
the
foresail
and
i
stood
in
with
the
intention
of
surrendering
myself
and
people
at
a
large
town
which
i
knew
was
situated
about
twelve
miles
farther
on
the
coast
to
have
given
myself
up
at
the
place
where
the
vessels
had
been
captured
i
did
not
think
would
have
been
prudent
when
we
made
sail
on
the
third
morning
we
had
drifted
within
half
a
mile
of
the
shore
and
very
near
the
place
we
had
left
field
pieces
had
been
brought
down
to
us
they
had
the
range
but
they
could
not
reach
us
i
continued
to
make
more
sail
and
to
creep
along
shore
until
i
came
within
a
few
cables
length
of
the
pier
where
men
women
and
children
were
assembled
to
see
us
land
when
suddenly
a
came
on
the
wind
shifted
and
blew
with
such
violence
that
i
could
neither
see
the
port
nor
turn
the
vessel
to
windward
into
it
and
as
i
knew
i
could
not
hold
my
own
and
that
the
wind
was
fair
for
our
ship
then
distant
about
forty
miles
we
agreed
to
up
helm
and
scud
for
her
this
was
well
executed
about
eleven
at
night
we
hailed
her
and
asked
for
a
boat
they
had
seen
us
approaching
and
a
boat
instantly
came
taking
us
all
on
board
the
frigate
and
leaving
some
fresh
hands
in
charge
of
the
prize
i
was
mad
with
hunger
and
cold
and
with
difficulty
did
we
get
up
the
side
so
exhausted
and
feeble
were
the
whole
of
us
i
was
ordered
down
into
the
cabin
for
it
was
too
cold
for
the
captain
to
show
his
face
on
deck
i
found
his
lordship
sitting
before
a
good
fire
with
his
toes
in
the
grate
a
decanter
of
madeira
stood
on
the
table
with
a
wine
glass
and
most
fortunately
though
not
intended
for
my
use
a
large
rummer
this
i
seized
with
one
hand
and
the
decanter
with
the
other
and
filling
a
bumper
swallowed
it
in
a
moment
without
even
drinking
his
lordship
good
health
he
stared
and
i
believe
thought
me
mad
i
certainly
do
own
that
my
dress
and
appearance
perfectly
corresponded
with
my
actions
i
had
not
been
washed
shaved
or
cleaned
since
i
had
left
the
ship
three
days
before
my
beard
was
grown
my
cheeks
hollow
my
eyes
sunk
and
for
my
stomach
i
leave
that
to
those
fortunate
frenchmen
who
escaped
from
the
russian
campaign
who
only
can
appreciate
my
sufferings
my
whole
haggard
frame
was
enveloped
in
a
huge
blue
flushing
coat
frosted
like
a
with
ice
and
snow
as
soon
as
i
could
speak
i
said
i
beg
pardon
my
lord
but
i
have
had
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
since
i
left
the
ship
oh
you
are
very
welcome
said
his
lordship
i
never
expected
to
see
you
again
then
why
the
devil
did
you
send
me
thought
i
to
myself
during
this
short
dialogue
i
had
neither
been
offered
a
chair
nor
any
refreshment
of
which
i
stood
so
much
in
need
and
if
i
had
been
able
should
have
been
kept
standing
while
i
related
my
adventures
i
was
about
to
commence
when
the
wine
got
into
my
head
and
to
support
myself
i
leaned
or
rather
staggered
on
the
back
of
a
chair
never
mind
now
said
the
captain
apparently
moved
from
his
listless
apathy
by
my
situation
go
and
make
yourself
comfortable
and
i
will
hear
it
all
this
was
the
only
kind
thing
he
had
ever
done
for
me
and
it
came
so
that
i
felt
grateful
to
him
for
it
thanked
him
and
went
below
to
the
where
notwithstanding
all
i
had
heard
and
read
of
the
dangers
of
repletion
after
long
abstinence
i
ate
voraciously
and
drank
proportionably
ever
and
anon
telling
my
astonished
messmates
who
were
looking
on
what
a
narrow
escape
the
dead
body
had
of
being
dissected
and
broiled
this
from
the
specimen
of
my
performance
they
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
i
recommended
the
three
men
who
had
been
with
me
to
the
care
of
the
surgeon
and
with
his
permission
presented
each
of
them
with
a
pint
of
hot
brandy
and
water
well
sweetened
by
way
of
a
night
cap
having
taken
these
precautions
and
satisfied
the
cravings
of
nature
on
my
own
part
as
well
as
the
cravings
of
curiosity
on
that
of
my
messmates
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
till
the
next
day
at
noon
thus
ended
this
anomalous
and
fatal
expedition
an
ambassador
sent
with
the
sacred
emblem
of
peace
to
commit
an
act
of
hostility
under
its
protection
to
have
been
taken
under
such
circumstances
would
have
subjected
us
to
be
hung
like
dogs
on
the
first
tree
to
have
gone
unarmed
would
have
been
an
act
of
insanity
and
i
therefore
took
upon
me
to
disobey
an
unjust
and
absurd
order
this
however
must
not
be
pleaded
as
an
example
to
juniors
but
a
warning
to
seniors
how
they
give
orders
without
duly
weighing
the
consequences
the
safest
plan
is
always
to
obey
thus
did
his
majesty
service
lose
eighteen
fine
fellows
under
much
severe
suffering
for
a
boat
the
property
of
the
captain
not
worth
twenty
pounds
the
next
day
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
the
first
lieutenant
sent
to
speak
to
me
i
then
recollected
the
little
affair
of
the
challenge
a
delightful
thought
i
to
the
tragedy
to
be
shot
by
the
first
lieutenant
only
for
calling
him
as
clever
a
fellow
as
the
captain
the
lieutenant
however
had
no
such
barbarous
intentions
he
had
seen
and
acknowledged
the
truth
of
my
observation
and
being
a
well
meaning
he
offered
me
his
hand
which
i
took
with
pleasure
having
had
quite
enough
of
stimulus
for
that
time
chapter
xxiv
you
have
an
opportunity
now
madam
to
revenge
yourself
upon
him
for
affronting
your
squirrel
o
the
filthy
rude
beast
is
a
lasting
quarrel
we
sailed
the
next
day
and
after
one
month
more
of
unsuccessful
cruising
arrived
safe
at
halifax
where
i
was
informed
that
an
old
friend
of
my
father
sir
hurricane
humbug
of
whom
some
mention
has
already
been
made
in
this
work
had
just
arrived
he
was
not
in
an
official
character
but
had
come
out
to
look
after
his
own
property
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
here
with
more
than
usual
formality
introduce
the
reader
to
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
character
of
sir
hurricane
sir
hurricane
had
risen
in
life
by
his
own
ingenuity
and
the
patronage
of
a
rich
man
in
the
south
of
england
he
was
of
an
ardent
disposition
and
was
an
admirable
justice
of
peace
when
the
was
required
for
which
reason
he
had
been
sent
to
reduce
two
or
three
refractory
establishments
to
order
and
obedience
and
by
his
firmness
and
good
humour
succeeded
his
tact
was
a
little
knowledge
of
everything
not
like
solomon
from
the
hyssop
to
the
cedar
but
from
the
boiler

potato
to
the
boiler
of
a
and
from
catching
a
sprat
to
catching
a
whale
he
could
fatten
pigs
and
poultry
and
had
a
peculiar
way
of
improving
the
size
though
not
the
breed
of
the
latter
in
short
he
was
jack
of
all
trades
and
master
of
none
i
shall
not
go
any
farther
back
with
his
memoirs
than
the
day
he
chose
to
teach
an
old
woman
how
to
make
he
had
in
the
course
of
an
honest
discharge
of
his
duty
at
a
certain
very
dirty
town
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
lower
orders
generally
he
nevertheless
would
omit
no
opportunity
of
doing
good
and
giving
advice
to
the
poor
gratis
one
day
he
saw
a
woman
emptying
the
contents
of
a
boiling
kettle
out
of
her
door
into
the
street
he
approached
and
saw
a
leg
of
mutton
at
the
bottom
and
the
unthrifty
housewife
throwing
away
the
liquor
in
which
it
had
been
boiled
good
woman
said
the
economical
baronet
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
a
handful
of
meat
a
couple
of
carrots
and
a
couple
of
turnips
cut
up
into
dice
and
thrown
into
that
liquor
with
a
little
parsley
would
make
excellent
for
your
family
the
old
woman
looked
up
and
saw
the
ogre
of
the
dockyard
and
either
by
losing
her
presence
of
mind
or
by
a
most
malignant
slip
of
the
hand
she
contrived
to
pour
a
part
of
the
boiling
water
into
the
shoes
of
sir
hurricane
the
baronet
jumped
roared
hopped
stamped
kicked
off
his
shoes
and
ran
home
d
ning
the
old
woman
and
himself
too
for
having
tried
to
teach
her
how
to
make
as
he
ran
off
the
ungrateful
hag
screamed
after
him
sarves
you
right
teach
you
to
mind
your
own
business
the
next
day
in
his
magisterial
capacity
he
commanded
the
attendance
of
the
dealer
in
slops
well
madam
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
for
scalding
one
of
his
majesty
justices
of
the
peace
do
you
know
that
i
have
the
power
to
commit
you
to
maidstone
gaol
for
the
assault
i
beg
your
honour
pardon
humbly
said
the
woman
i
did
not
know
it
was
your
honour
or
i
am
sure
i
would
a
done
it
besides
i
own
to
your
honour
i
had
a
drop
too
much
the
baronet
dismissed
her
with
a
little
suitable
advice
which
no
doubt
the
good
woman
treated
as
she
did
that
relative
to
the
my
acquaintance
with
sir
hurricane
had
commenced
at
plymouth
when
he
kicked
my
ship
to
sea
in
a
gale
of
wind
for
fear
we
should
ground
on
our
beef
bones
i
never
forgave
him
for
that
my
father
had
shown
him
great
civility
and
had
introduced
me
to
him
when
at
halifax
we
resided
in
the
same
house
with
a
mutual
friend
who
had
always
received
me
as
his
own
son
he
had
a
son
of
my
own
age
with
whom
i
had
long
been
on
terms
of
warm
friendship
and
ned
and
i
confederated
against
sir
hurricane
having
paid
a
few
visits
as
i
landed
at
the
king
wharf
shook
hands
with
a
few
pretty
girls
and
received
their
congratulations
on
my
safe
return
i
went
to
the
house
of
my
friend
and
without
ceremony
walked
into
the
do
you
know
sir
said
the
footman
that
sir
hurricane
is
in
his
room
but
he
is
very
busy
added
the
man
with
a
smile
busy
or
not
said
i
i
am
sure
he
will
see
me
so
in
i
walked
sir
hurricane
was
employed
on
something
but
i
could
not
distinctly
make
out
what
he
had
a
boot
between
his
knees
and
the
calves
of
his
legs
which
he
pressed
together
and
as
he
turned
his
head
round
i
perceived
that
he
held
a
knife
between
his
teeth
leave
the
door
open
messmate
said
he
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
me
then
rising
he
drew
a
large
black
tom
cat
by
the
tail
out
of
the
boot
and
flinging
it
away
from
him
to
a
great
distance
which
distance
was
rapidly
increased
by
the
voluntary
exertion
of
the
cat
which
ran
away
as
if
it
had
been
mad
there
said
he
and
be
d
d
to
you
you
have
given
me
more
trouble
than
a
whole
kentucky
but
i
shall
not
lose
my
sleep
any
more
by
your
d
d
caterwauling
all
this
was
pronounced
as
if
he
had
not
seen
me
in
fact
it
was
a
soliloquy
for
the
cat
did
not
stay
to
hear
it
ah
said
he
holding
out
his
hand
to
me
how
do
you
do
i
know
your
face
but
d
n
me
if
i
have
not
forgot
your
name
my
name
sir
said
i
is
mildmay
ah
mildmay
my
noble
how
do
you
do
how
did
you
leave
your
father
i
knew
him
very
well
used
to
give
devilish
good
feeds
many
a
plate
i
dirtied
at
his
table
do
care
how
soon
i
put
my
legs
under
it
again
take
care
mind
which
way
you
put
your
helm
you
will
be
aboard
of
my
chickabiddies
do
run
athwart
hawse
i
found
on
looking
down
that
i
had
a
string
round
my
leg
which
fastened
a
chicken
to
the
table
and
saw
many
more
of
these
little
creatures
attached
to
the
chairs
in
the
room
but
for
what
purpose
they
were
thus
domesticated
i
could
not
discover
are
these
pet
chickens
of
yours
sir
hurricane
said
i
no
said
the
admiral
but
i
mean
them
to
be
pet
capons
by
and
by
when
they
come
to
table
i
finished
a
dozen
and
a
half
this
morning
besides
that
d
d
old
tom
cat
the
mystery
was
now
explained
and
i
afterwards
found
out
every
man
having
his
hobby
that
the
idiosyncrasy
of
this
officer
disposition
had
led
him
to
the
practice
of
neutralising
the
males
of
any
species
of
bird
or
beast
in
order
to
render
them
more
palatable
at
the
table
well
sir
he
continued
how
do
you
like
your
new
ship
how
do
you
like
your
old
captain
good
fellow
is
he
d
n
his
eyes
countryman
of
mine
i
knew
him
when
his
father
had
as
much
money
as
would
jingle
on
a
tombstone
that
fellow
owes
every
thing
to
me
i
introduced
him
to
the
duke
of
and
he
got
on
by
that
interest
but
i
say
what
do
you
think
of
the
halifax
girls
nice
they
i
expressed
my
admiration
of
them
ay
ay
they
do
wo
they
we
have
some
fine
fun
give
the
girls
a
party
at
george
island
haymaking
green
gowns
ha
ha
ha
i
say
your
captain
shall
give
us
a
party
at
turtle
cove
we
are
going
to
give
the
old
commissioner
a
feed
at
the
rockingham
blow
the
roof
of
his
skull
off
with
champagne
do
you
dine
at
birch
cove
no
i
suppose
you
are
engaged
to
miss
maria
or
miss
susan
or
miss
isabella
ha
sad
dog
sad
dog
done
a
great
deal
of
mischief
surveying
me
from
head
to
foot
i
took
the
liberty
of
returning
him
the
same
compliment
he
was
a
tall
man
with
strongly
marked
features
and
a
smile
on
his
countenance
that
no
modest
woman
could
endure
in
his
person
he
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
discharged
but
from
his
face
you
might
have
supposed
that
he
had
sat
for
one
of
rubens
satyrs
he
was
one
of
those
people
with
whom
you
become
immediately
acquainted
and
before
i
had
been
an
hour
in
his
company
i
laughed
very
heartily
at
his
jokes
not
very
delicate
i
own
and
for
which
he
lost
a
considerable
portion
of
my
respect
but
he
was
a
source
of
constant
amusement
to
me
living
as
we
did
in
the
same
house
i
was
just
going
out
of
the
room
when
he
stopped
me
i
say
how
should
you
like
to
be
introduced
to
some
devilish
nice
yankee
girls
relations
of
mine
from
philadelphia
and
i
should
be
obliged
to
you
to
show
them
attention
very
pretty
girls
i
can
tell
you
and
will
have
good
fortunes
you
may
go
farther
and
fare
worse
the
old
dad
is
as
rich
as
a
jew
got
the
gout
in
both
legs
ca
hold
out
much
longer
nice
pickings
at
his
money
bags
while
the
devil
is
picking
his
bones
there
was
no
withstanding
such
inducements
and
i
agreed
that
he
should
present
me
the
next
day
our
dialogue
was
interrupted
by
the
master
of
the
house
and
his
son
who
gave
me
a
hearty
welcome
the
father
had
been
a
widower
for
some
years
and
his
only
son
ned
resided
with
him
and
was
intended
to
succeed
to
his
business
as
a
merchant
we
adjourned
to
dress
for
dinner
our
were
contiguous
and
we
began
to
talk
of
sir
hurricane
he
is
a
strange
mixture
said
ned
i
love
him
for
his
good
temper
but
i
owe
him
a
grudge
for
making
mischief
between
me
and
maria
besides
he
talks
balderdash
before
the
ladies
and
annoys
them
very
much
i
owe
him
a
grudge
too
said
i
for
sending
me
to
sea
in
a
gale
of
wind
we
shall
both
be
quits
with
him
before
long
said
ned
but
let
us
now
go
and
meet
him
at
dinner
i
will
set
the
housekeeper
at
him
for
his
cruelty
to
her
cat
and
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
she
will
pay
him
off
for
it
dinner
passed
off
extremely
well
the
admiral
was
in
high
spirits
and
as
it
was
a
bachelor
party
he
earned
his
wine
the
next
morning
we
met
at
breakfast
when
that
was
over
the
master
of
the
house
retired
to
his
office
or
pretended
to
do
so
i
was
going
out
to
walk
but
ned
said
i
had
better
stay
a
few
minutes
he
had
something
to
say
to
me
in
fact
he
had
prepared
a
treat
without
my
knowing
it
how
did
you
sleep
last
night
sir
hurricane
said
the
artful
ned
why
pretty
well
considering
said
the
admiral
i
was
not
tormented
by
that
old
tom
cat
d
n
me
sir
that
fellow
was
like
the
grand
signior
and
he
kept
his
seraglio
in
the
garret
over
my
instead
of
being
at
his
post
in
the
kitchen
killing
the
rats
that
are
running
about
like
sir
hurricane
said
i
it
always
unlucky
to
sailors
if
they
meddle
with
cats
you
will
have
a
gale
of
wind
in
some
shape
or
another
before
long
these
words
were
hardly
uttered
when
as
if
by
preconcerted
arrangement
the
door
opened
and
in
sailed
mrs
jellybag
the
housekeeper
an
elderly
woman
somewhere
in
the
latitude
of
or
sixty
years
with
a
low
courtesy
and
contemptuous
toss
of
her
head
she
addressed
sir
hurricane
humbug
pray
sir
hurricane
what
have
you
been
doing
to
my
cat
the
admiral
who
prided
himself
in
putting
any
one
who
applied
to
him
on
what
he
called
the
wrong
scent
endeavoured
to
play
off
mrs
jellybag
in
the
same
manner
what
have
i
done
to
your
cat
my
dear
mrs
jellybag
why
my
dear
madam
said
he
assuming
an
air
of
surprise
what
i
do
to
your
cat
you
have
left
him
alone
mr
admiral
that
cat
was
my
property
if
my
master
permits
you
to
the
poultry
his
concern
but
that
cat
was
mine
sir
hurricane
mine
every
inch
of
him
the
animal
has
been
and
sits
moping
in
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
as
if
he
was
dying
he
never
be
the
cat
he
was
again
i
do
think
he
ever
will
my
dear
mrs
housekeeper
answered
the
admiral
drily
the
lady
wrath
now
began
to
kindle
the
admiral
cool
replies
were
like
water
sprinkled
upon
a
strong
flame
increasing
its
force
instead
of
checking
it
do
dear
sir
hurricane
i
am
not
one
of
are
all
in
dutchtown
more
shame
for
you
an
old
man
like
you
old
man
cried
sir
hurricane
losing
his
placidity
a
little
yes
old
man
look
at
your
hair
as
grey
as
a
goose
why
as
for
my
hair
that
proves
nothing
mrs
jellybag
for
though
there
may
be
snow
on
the
mountains
there
is
still
heat
in
the
valleys
what
d
think
of
my
metaphor
i
am
no
more
a
than
yourself
sir
hurricane
but
tell
you
what
you
are
a
admiral
a
barrownight
who
was
jealous
of
my
poor
tom
cat
because
i
say
what
yes
sir
hurricane
all
hours
of
the
day
you
are
leering
at
every
young
woman
that
passes
out
of
our
windows
and
an
old
man
too
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
and
then
you
go
to
church
of
a
sunday
and
cry
lord
deliver
us
the
housekeeper
now
advanced
so
close
to
the
admiral
that
her
nose
nearly
touched
his
her
arms
akimbo
and
every
preparation
for
boarding
the
admiral
fearing
she
might
not
confine
herself
to
vocality
but
begin
to
beat
time
with
her
fists
thought
it
right
to
take
up
a
position
he
therefore
very
dexterously
took
two
steps
in
the
rear
and
mounted
on
a
sofa
his
left
was
defended
by
an
upright
piano
his
right
by
the
with
all
the
on
it
his
rear
was
against
the
wall
and
his
front
depended
on
himself
in
person
from
this
commanding
eminence
he
now
looked
down
on
the
housekeeper
whose
nose
could
reach
no
higher
than
the
seals
of
her
adversary
watch
and
in
proportion
as
the
baronet
felt
his
security
so
rose
his
choler
having
been
for
many
years
proctor
at
the
great
universities
of
and
as
well
as
member
of
barbican
and
north
corner
he
was
perfectly
qualified
in
point
of
classical
dialect
to
maintain
the
honour
of
his
profession
nor
was
the
lady
by
any
means
deficient
although
she
had
not
taken
her
degree
her
tongue
from
constant
use
had
acquired
a
fluency
which
nature
only
concedes
to
practice
it
will
not
be
expected
nor
would
it
be
proper
that
i
should
repeat
all
that
passed
in
this
concluding
scene
in
which
the
housekeeper
gave
us
good
reason
to
suppose
that
she
was
not
quite
so
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
transaction
as
she
would
have
had
us
believe
the
battle
having
raged
for
half
an
hour
with
great
fury
both
parties
desisted
for
want
of
breath
and
consequently
of
ammunition
this
produced
a
gradual
cessation
of
firing
and
by
degrees
the
ships
separated
the
admiral
like
lord
howe
on
the
first
of
june
preserving
his
position
though
very
much
mauled
and
the
housekeeper
like
the
montague
to
join
her
associates
a
few
random
shots
were
exchanged
as
they
parted
and
at
every
second
or
third
step
on
the
stairs
mrs
margaret
brought
to
and
fired
until
both
were
quite
out
of
range
a
distant
rumbling
noise
was
heard
and
the
admiral
concluded
by
muttering
that
she
might
go
somewhere
but
the
word
died
between
his
teeth
there
admiral
said
i
did
not
i
tell
you
that
you
would
have
a
squall
squall
yes
d
n
my
blood
wiping
his
face
how
the
spray
flew
from
the
old
beldam
she
fairly
wetted
my
trousers
by
god
ever
thought
that
such
a
purring
old
b
h
could
have
shown
such
a
set
of
claws
war
to
the
knife
by
heavens
i
make
her
remember
this
notwithstanding
the
admiral
threat
hostilities
ceased
from
that
day
the
admiral
found
it
convenient
to
show
a
white
feather
interest
stood
in
the
way
and
barred
him
from
taking
his
revenge
mrs
jellybag
was
a
faithful
servant
and
our
host
neither
liked
that
she
should
be
interfered
with
or
that
his
house
should
become
an
arena
for
such
conflicts
and
the
admiral
who
was
peculiarly
tenacious
of
undrawing
the
strings
of
his
purse
found
it
convenient
to
make
the
first
advances
the
affair
was
therefore
amicably
arranged
the
tom
cat
was
in
consideration
of
his
sufferings
created
a
baronet
and
was
ever
afterwards
dignified
by
the
title
of
who
certainly
was
the
most
eligible
person
to
select
for
as
he
had
taken
the
most
effectual
means
of
weaning
him
from
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
this
wicked
world
it
was
now
about
one
for
this
dispute
had
ran
away
with
the
best
part
of
the
morning
when
sir
hurricane
said
come
youngster
do
forget
your
engagements
you
know
i
have
got
to
introduce
you
to
my
pretty
cousins
you
must
mind
your
p
and
q
with
the
uncle
for
he
is
a
sensible
old
fellow
has
read
a
great
deal
and
thinks
america
the
first
and
greatest
country
in
the
world
we
accordingly
proceeded
to
the
residence
of
the
fair
strangers
whom
the
admiral
assured
me
had
come
to
halifax
from
mere
curiosity
under
the
protection
of
their
uncle
and
aunt
we
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
admiral
inquired
if
mrs
was
at
home
we
were
answered
in
the
affirmative
the
servant
asked
our
names
vice
admiral
sir
hurricane
humbug
said
i
and
mr
mildmay
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
the
man
gave
our
names
with
great
propriety
in
we
walked
a
tall
elderly
lady
received
us
standing
bolt
upright
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
young
ladies
were
seated
at
their
work
my
dear
mrs
said
the
admiral
how
do
you
do
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
and
your
fair
nieces
looking
so
lovely
this
morning
the
lady
bowed
to
this
compliment
a
courtesy
she
was
not
quite
up
to
allow
me
to
introduce
my
gallant
young
friend
mildmay
young
ladies
take
care
of
your
hearts
he
is
a
great
rogue
i
assure
you
though
he
smiles
so
sweet
upon
you
mrs
bowed
again
to
me
hoped
i
was
very
well
and
inquired
how
long
i
had
been
in
these
parts
i
replied
that
i
had
just
returned
from
a
cruise
but
that
i
was
no
stranger
in
halifax
come
officer
said
the
admiral
taking
me
by
the
arm
i
see
you
are
bashful
i
must
make
you
acquainted
with
my
pretty
cousins
this
sir
is
miss
her
christian
name
is
deliverance
she
is
a
young
lady
whose
beauty
is
her
least
recommendation
a
very
equivocal
compliment
thought
i
this
sir
is
miss
jemima
this
is
miss
temperance
and
this
is
miss
deborah
now
that
you
know
them
all
by
name
and
they
know
you
i
hope
you
will
contrive
to
make
yourself
both
useful
and
agreeable
a
very
pretty
sinecure
thinks
i
to
myself
just
as
if
i
had
not
my
hands
full
already
however
as
i
never
wanted
small
talk
for
pretty
faces
i
began
with
jemima
they
were
all
pretty
but
she
was
a
love
yet
there
was
an
awkwardness
about
them
that
convinced
me
they
were
not
of
the
of
philadelphia
the
answers
to
all
my
questions
were
quick
pert
and
given
with
an
air
of
assumed
consequence
at
the
same
time
i
observed
a
mode
of
expression
which
though
english
was
not
english
did
you
come
through
the
united
states
said
i
into
the
british
territory
or
did
you
come
by
water
oh
by
water
screamed
all
the
girls
at
once
and
to
have
been
eaten
up
with
the
nasty
roaches
i
did
not
exactly
know
what
was
meant
by
roaches
but
it
was
explained
to
me
soon
after
i
inquired
whether
they
had
seen
a
british
and
whether
they
would
like
to
accompany
me
on
board
of
that
which
i
belonged
to
they
all
screamed
out
at
same
moment
no
we
never
have
seen
one
and
should
like
to
see
it
of
all
things
when
will
you
take
us
said
i
if
the
day
should
prove
fine
here
the
admiral
who
had
been
making
with
the
old
chaperon
turned
round
and
said
well
mr
frank
i
see
you
are
getting
on
pretty
well
without
my
assistance
oh
we
all
like
him
very
much
said
temperance
and
he
says
he
will
take
us
on
board
his
ship
softly
my
dear
said
the
aunt
we
must
not
think
of
giving
the
gentleman
the
trouble
until
we
are
better
acquainted
i
am
sure
aunt
said
deborah
we
are
very
well
acquainted
then
said
the
aunt
seeing
she
was
in
the
minority
suppose
you
and
sir
hurricane
come
and
breakfast
with
us
morning
at
eleven
after
which
we
shall
all
be
very
much
at
your
service
here
the
admiral
looked
at
me
with
one
of
his
impudent
leers
and
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
but
i
commanded
my
countenance
very
well
and
rebuked
him
by
a
steady
and
reserved
look
i
shall
have
great
pleasure
said
i
to
the
lady
in
obeying
your
orders
from
eleven
morning
till
the
hour
of
dinner
when
i
am
engaged
so
saying
we
both
bowed
wished
them
a
good
morning
and
left
the
room
the
door
closed
upon
us
and
i
heard
them
all
exclaim
what
a
charming
young
man
i
went
on
board
and
told
the
first
lieutenant
what
i
had
done
he
very
said
he
would
do
his
best
though
the
ship
was
not
in
order
for
showing
and
would
have
a
boat
ready
for
us
at
the
stairs
at
one
the
next
day
i
went
to
breakfast
at
the
appointed
hour
the
admiral
did
not
appear
but
the
ladies
were
all
in
readiness
and
i
was
introduced
to
their
uncle
a
plain
man
with
a
strong
nasal
twang
the
repast
was
very
good
and
as
i
had
a
great
deal
of
work
before
me
i
made
hay
while
the
sun
shone
when
the
rage
of
hunger
had
been
a
little
appeased
i
made
use
of
the
first
belle
to
inquire
if
a
lady
whom
i
once
had
the
honour
of
knowing
was
any
relation
of
theirs
as
she
bore
the
same
name
and
came
like
them
from
philadelphia
oh
dear
yes
indeed
she
is
a
relation
said
all
the
ladies
together
we
have
not
seen
her
this
seven
years
when
did
you
see
her
last
i
replied
that
we
had
not
met
for
some
time
but
that
the
last
time
i
had
heard
of
her
she
was
seen
by
a
friend
of
mine
at
turin
on
the
po
the
last
syllable
was
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
than
tea
coffee
and
chocolate
was
out
of
theirs
all
spirting
different
ways
just
like
so
many
young
grampuses
they
jumped
up
from
the
table
and
ran
away
to
their
rooms
convulsed
with
laughter
leaving
me
alone
with
their
uncle
i
was
all
amazement
and
i
own
felt
a
little
annoyed
i
asked
if
i
had
made
any
serious
lapsus
or
said
any
thing
very
ridiculous
or
indelicate
if
i
had
i
said
i
should
never
forgive
myself
sir
said
mr
i
am
very
sure
you
meant
nothing
indelicate
but
the
refined
society
of
philadelphia
in
which
these
young
ladies
have
been
educated
attaches
very
different
meanings
to
certain
words
to
what
you
do
in
the
old
country
the
back
settlements
for
instance
so
called
by
our
ancestors
we
call
the
western
settlements
and
we
apply
the
same
term
by
analogy
to
the
human
figure
and
dress
this
is
a
mere
little
explanation
which
you
will
take
as
it
is
meant
it
can
not
be
expected
that
should
understand
the
niceties
of
our
language
i
begged
pardon
for
my
ignorance
and
assured
him
i
would
be
more
cautious
in
future
but
pray
tell
me
said
i
what
there
was
in
my
last
observation
which
could
have
caused
so
much
mirth
at
my
expense
why
sir
said
mr
you
run
me
hard
there
but
since
you
force
me
to
explain
myself
i
must
say
that
you
used
a
word
exclusively
confined
to
bedchambers
but
surely
sir
said
i
you
will
allow
that
the
name
of
a
celebrated
river
renowned
in
the
most
ancient
of
our
histories
is
not
to
be
changed
from
such
a
refined
notion
of
false
delicacy
there
you
are
wrong
said
mr
the
french
who
are
our
instructors
in
every
thing
teach
us
how
to
name
all
these
things
and
i
think
you
will
allow
that
they
understand
true
politeness
i
bowed
to
this
dictum
only
observing
that
there
was
a
point
in
our
language
where
delicacy
became
indelicate
that
i
thought
the
noble
river
had
a
priority
of
claim
over
a
contemptible
vessel
and
reverting
to
the
former
part
of
his
discourse
i
said
that
we
in
england
were
not
ashamed
to
call
things
by
their
proper
names
and
that
we
considered
it
a
great
mark
of
to
go
round
about
for
a
substitute
to
a
common
word
the
vulgar
import
of
which
a
well
bred
and
modest
woman
ought
never
to
have
known
the
old
gentleman
felt
a
little
abashed
at
this
rebuke
and
to
relieve
him
i
changed
the
subject
hoping
that
the
ladies
would
forgive
me
for
this
once
and
return
to
their
breakfasts
why
as
for
that
matter
said
the
gentleman
the
philadelphia
ladies
have
very
delicate
appetites
and
i
dare
say
they
have
had
enough
finding
i
was
not
likely
to
gain
ground
on
that
tack
i
steered
my
own
course
and
finished
my
breakfast
comforting
myself
that
much
execution
had
been
done
by
the
ladies
on
the
commissariat
department
before
the
po
had
made
its
appearance
by
the
time
i
had
finished
the
ladies
had
composed
themselves
and
the
pretty
jemima
had
recovered
the
gravity
of
her
lovely
mouth
decked
in
shawls
and
bonnets
they
expressed
much
impatience
to
be
gone
we
walked
to
the
where
a
boat
with
a
midshipman
attended
and
in
a
few
minutes
conveyed
us
alongside
of
my
ship
a
painted
cask
shaped
like
a
chair
with
a
whip
from
the
main
was
let
down
into
the
boat
and
i
carefully
packed
the
fair
creatures
two
at
a
time
and
sent
them
up
there
was
a
good
deal
of
giggling
and
screaming
and
loud
laughing
which
rather
annoyed
me
for
as
they
were
not
my
friends
i
had
no
wish
that
my
messmates
should
think
they
belonged
to
that
set
in
halifax
in
which
i
was
so
kindly
received
at
length
all
were
safely
landed
on
the
without
the
exposure
of
an
ancle
which
they
all
seemed
to
dread
whether
their
ancles
were
not
quite
so
small
as
mr
wished
me
to
suppose
their
appetites
were
i
can
not
say
la
aunt
said
deborah
when
i
looked
up
in
the
air
and
saw
you
and
deliverance
dangling
over
our
heads
i
thought
if
the
rope
was
to
break
what
a
you
would
have
come
on
us
i
am
sure
you
would
have
determined
to
have
the
philadelphia
version
of
this
elegant
phrase
i
inquired
what
it
meant
and
was
informed
that
in
their
country
when
any
one
had
his
bowels
out
they
called
it
well
thought
i
after
this
you
might
swallow
the
po
without
spoiling
your
breakfasts
the
band
struck
up
yankee
doodle
the
ladies
were
in
ecstacy
and
began
to
caper
round
the
la
jemima
said
deborah
what
have
you
done
to
the
western
side
of
your
gown
it
is
all
over
white
this
was
soon
brushed
off
but
the
expression
was
never
forgotten
in
the
ship
and
always
ludicrously
applied
having
shown
them
the
ship
and
all
its
wonders
i
was
glad
to
conduct
them
back
to
the
shore
when
i
met
the
admiral
i
told
him
i
had
done
the
honours
and
hoped
the
next
time
he
had
any
female
relatives
he
would
keep
his
engagements
and
attend
to
them
himself
why
now
who
do
you
think
they
are
said
the
admiral
think
said
i
why
who
should
they
be
but
your
yankee
cousins
why
was
you
such
a
d
d
flat
as
to
believe
what
i
said
eh
why
their
father
keeps
a
shop
of
all
sorts
at
philadelphia
and
they
were
going
to
new
york
on
a
visit
to
some
of
their
relatives
when
the
ship
they
were
in
was
taken
and
brought
in
here
then
said
i
these
are
not
the
of
philadelphia
just
as
much
as
nancy
dennis
is
the
of
halifax
said
the
admiral
though
the
uncle
as
i
told
you
is
a
sensible
fellow
in
his
way
very
well
said
i
you
have
caught
me
for
once
but
remember
i
pay
you
for
it
and
i
was
not
long
in
his
debt
had
he
not
given
me
this
explanation
i
should
have
received
a
very
false
impression
of
the
ladies
of
philadelphia
and
have
done
them
an
injustice
for
which
i
should
never
have
forgiven
myself
the
time
of
our
sailing
drew
near
this
was
always
a
melancholy
time
in
halifax
but
my
last
act
on
shore
was
one
which
created
some
mirth
and
enlivened
the
gloom
of
my
departure
my
friend
ned
and
myself
had
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
of
paying
off
sir
hurricane
humbug
for
telling
tales
to
maria
and
for
his
false
introduction
to
myself
one
morning
we
both
came
out
of
our
rooms
at
the
same
moment
and
were
proceeding
to
the
breakfast
parlour
when
we
spied
the
admiral
performing
some
experiment
unfortunately
for
him
he
was
seated
in
such
a
manner
just
clear
of
a
as
to
be
visible
from
our
position
and
at
the
same
time
the
collar
of
his
coat
would
exactly
intersect
the
segment
of
a
circle
described
by
any
fluid
projected
by
us
over
this
low
roof
which
would
thus
act
as
a
conductor
into
the
very
pole
of
his
neck
the
housemaid
these
housemaids
are
always
the
cause
or
the
instruments
of
mischief
either
by
design
or
neglect
had
left
standing
near
the
window
a
pail
nearly
filled
with
dirty
water
from
the
basins
ned
and
i
looked
at
each
other
then
at
the
pail
then
at
the
admiral
ned
thought
of
his
maria
i
of
my
false
introduction
without
saying
a
word
we
both
laid
our
hands
on
the
pail
and
in
an
instant
souse
went
all
the
contents
over
the
admiral
i
say
what
this
he
roared
out
oh
you
d
d
rascals
he
knew
it
could
only
be
us
we
laughed
so
immoderately
that
we
had
not
the
power
to
move
or
to
speak
while
the
poor
admiral
was
spitting
sputtering
and
coughing
enough
to
bring
his
heart
up
you
infernal
villains
no
respect
for
a
i
serve
you
out
for
this
the
tears
rolled
down
our
cheeks
but
not
with
grief
as
soon
as
the
admiral
had
sufficiently
recovered
himself
to
go
in
pursuit
we
thought
it
time
to
make
sail
we
knew
we
were
discovered
and
as
the
matter
could
not
be
made
worse
we
resolved
to
tell
him
what
it
was
for
ned
began
how
do
you
do
admiral
you
have
taken
a
this
morning
he
looked
up
with
his
teeth
clenched
oh
it
you
is
it
yes
i
thought
it
could
be
no
one
else
yes
i
have
had
a
and
be
d
d
to
you
and
that
of
a
friend
of
yours
pretty
pass
the
service
has
come
to
when
officers
of
my
rank
are
treated
in
this
way
i
make
you
both
envy
the
beware
the
housekeeper
admiral
said
ned
maria
has
made
it
up
with
me
admiral
and
she
sends
her
love
to
you
d
n
maria
oh
very
well
i
tell
her
so
said
ned
admiral
said
i
do
you
remember
when
you
sent
the
to
sea
in
a
gale
of
wind
when
i
was
midshipman
of
her
well
i
got
just
as
wet
that
night
as
you
are
now
pray
admiral
have
you
any
commands
to
the
misses
i
tell
you
when
i
catch
hold
of
you
said
sir
hurricane
as
he
moved
up
stairs
to
his
room
dripping
like
pope
lodona
only
not
smelling
so
sweet
hearing
a
noise
the
housekeeper
came
up
and
all
the
family
assembled
to
condole
with
the
humid
admiral
but
each
enjoying
the
joke
as
much
as
ourselves
we
however
paid
rather
dearly
for
it
the
admiral
swore
that
neither
of
us
should
eat
or
drink
in
the
house
for
three
days
and
ned
father
though
ready
to
burst
with
laughter
was
forced
in
common
decency
to
say
that
he
thought
the
admiral
perfectly
right
after
so
gross
a
violation
of
hospitality
i
went
and
dined
on
board
my
ship
ned
went
to
a
but
on
the
third
morning
after
the
shower
i
popped
my
head
into
the
breakfast
parlour
and
said
admiral
i
have
a
good
story
to
tell
you
if
you
will
let
me
come
in
i
see
you
d
d
first
you
young
scum
of
a
fish
pond
be
off
or
i
shy
the
ham
at
your
head
no
but
indeed
my
dear
admiral
it
is
such
a
nice
story
it
is
one
just
to
your
fancy
well
then
stand
there
and
tell
it
but
do
come
in
for
if
you
do
i
stood
at
the
door
and
told
him
the
story
well
now
said
he
that
is
a
good
story
and
i
will
forgive
you
for
it
so
with
a
hearty
laugh
at
my
ingenuity
he
promised
to
forgive
us
both
and
i
ran
and
fetched
ned
to
breakfast
this
was
the
safest
mode
we
could
have
adopted
to
get
into
favour
for
the
admiral
was
a
powerful
gigantic
fellow
that
could
have
given
us
some
very
awkward
squeezes
the
peace
was
very
honourably
kept
and
the
next
day
the
ship
sailed
chapter
xxv
they
turned
into
a
long
and
wide
street
in
which
not
a
single
living
figure
appeared
to
break
the
perspective
solitude
is
never
so
overpowering
as
when
it
exists
among
the
works
of
man
in
old
woods
or
on
the
tops
of
mountains
it
is
graceful
and
benignant
for
it
is
at
home
but
where
thick
dwellings
are
it
wears
a
inesilla
we
were
ordered
to
look
out
for
the
american
squadron
that
had
done
so
much
mischief
to
our
trade
and
directed
our
course
for
this
purpose
to
the
coast
of
africa
we
had
been
out
about
ten
days
when
a
vessel
was
seen
from
the
we
were
at
that
time
within
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
leagues
of
the
cape
de
verd
islands
we
set
all
sail
in
chase
and
soon
made
her
out
to
be
a
large
frigate
who
seemed
to
have
no
objection
to
the
meeting
but
evidently
tried
her
rate
of
sailing
with
us
occasionally
her
behaviour
left
us
no
doubt
that
she
was
an
american
frigate
and
we
cleared
for
action
the
captain
i
believe
had
never
been
in
a
sea
fight
or
if
he
had
he
had
entirely
forgotten
all
he
had
learned
for
which
reason
in
order
to
refresh
his
memory
he
laid
upon
the
the
famous
epitome
of
john
hamilton
moore
now
obsolete
but
held
at
that
time
to
be
one
of
the
most
luminous
authors
who
had
ever
treated
on
maritime
affairs
john
who
certainly
gives
a
great
deal
of
advice
on
every
subject
has
amongst
other
valuable
directions
told
us
how
to
bring
a
ship
into
action
according
to
the
best
and
most
approved
methods
and
how
to
take
your
enemy
afterwards
if
you
can
but
the
said
john
must
have
thought
red
hot
shot
could
be
heated
by
a
process
somewhat
similar
to
that
by
which
he
heated
his
own
nose
or
he
must
entirely
have
forgotten
the
manners
and
customs
in
such
cases
used
at
sea
for
he
recommends
as
a
prelude
or
first
course
to
the
entertainment
a
good
dose
of
red
hot
shot
served
up
the
moment
the
guests
are
assembled
but
does
not
tell
us
where
the
said
dishes
are
to
be
cooked
no
doubt
whatever
that
a
broadside
composed
of
such
ingredients
would
be
a
great
desideratum
in
favour
of
a
victory
especially
if
the
enemy
should
happen
to
have
none
of
his
own
to
give
in
return
so
thought
his
lordship
who
walking
up
to
the
first
lieutenant
said
mr
thingamay
do
you
think
red
hot
should
be
given
in
the
first
broadside
to
that
thingumbob
red
hot
shot
do
you
mean
my
lord
yes
said
his
lordship
do
you
think
they
would
settle
his
hash
where
the
devil
are
we
to
get
them
my
lord
said
the
first
lieutenant
who
was
not
the
same
that
wanted
to
fight
me
for
saying
he
was
as
clever
a
fellow
as
the
captain
that
man
had
been
unshipped
by
the
machinations
of
toady
very
true
said
his
lordship
we
now
approached
the
stranger
very
fast
when
to
our
great
mortification
she
proved
to
be
an
english
frigate
she
made
the
private
signal
it
was
answered
showed
her
number
we
showed
ours
and
her
captain
being
junior
officer
came
on
board
to
pay
his
respects
and
show
his
order
he
was
three
weeks
from
england
brought
news
of
a
peace
with
france
and
among
other
treats
a
navy
list
which
next
to
a
bottle
of
london
porter
is
the
greatest
luxury
to
a
sea
officer
in
a
foreign
climate
greedily
did
we
all
run
over
this
interesting
little
book
and
among
the
names
of
the
new
made
commanders
i
was
overjoyed
to
find
my
own
the
last
on
the
list
to
be
sure
but
that
i
cared
not
for
i
received
the
congratulations
of
my
messmates
we
parted
company
with
the
stranger
and
steered
for
the
island
of
st
jago
our
captain
intending
to
complete
his
water
in
port
praya
bay
previous
to
a
long
cruise
after
the
american
squadron
we
found
here
a
slave
vessel
in
charge
of
a
naval
officer
bound
to
england
and
i
thought
this
a
good
opportunity
to
quit
not
being
over
anxious
to
serve
as
a
lieutenant
when
i
knew
i
was
a
commander
i
was
also
particularly
anxious
to
return
to
england
for
many
reasons
the
hand
of
my
dear
emily
standing
at
the
head
of
them
i
therefore
requested
the
captain
permission
to
quit
the
ship
and
as
he
wished
to
give
an
acting
order
to
one
of
his
own
followers
he
consented
i
took
my
leave
of
all
my
messmates
and
of
my
captain
who
though
an
unfeeling
coxcomb
and
no
sailor
certainly
had
some
good
points
about
him
in
fact
his
lordship
was
a
gentleman
and
had
his
ship
fallen
in
with
an
enemy
she
would
have
been
well
fought
as
he
had
good
officers
was
sufficiently
aware
of
his
own
incapability
would
take
advice
and
as
a
man
of
undaunted
bravery
was
not
to
be
surpassed
in
the
service
on
the
third
day
after
our
arrival
the
frigate
sailed
i
went
on
board
the
slaver
which
had
no
slaves
on
board
except
four
to
assist
in
working
the
vessel
she
was
in
a
filthy
state
and
there
was
no
inn
on
shore
and
of
course
no
remedy
port
praya
is
the
only
good
anchorage
in
the
island
the
old
town
of
st
jago
was
deserted
in
consequence
of
there
being
only
an
open
roadstead
before
it
very
unsafe
for
vessels
to
lie
in
the
town
of
port
praya
is
a
miserable
assemblage
of
mud
huts
the
governor
house
and
one
more
are
better
built
but
they
are
not
so
comfortable
as
a
cottage
in
england
there
were
not
ten
portuguese
on
the
island
and
above
ten
thousand
blacks
all
originally
slaves
and
yet
every
thing
was
peaceable
although
fresh
arrivals
of
slaves
came
every
day
it
was
easy
to
distinguish
the
different
races
the
yatoffes
are
tall
men
not
very
stoutly
built
most
of
them
are
soldiers
i
have
seen
ten
of
them
standing
together
the
lowest
not
less
than
six
feet
two
or
three
inches
the
foulahs
from
the
ashantee
country
are
another
race
they
are
powerful
and
muscular
badly
disposed
and
treacherous
the
mandingoes
are
a
smaller
race
than
the
others
but
they
are
well
disposed
and
tractable
the
island
of
slaves
is
kept
in
subjection
by
slaves
only
who
are
enrolled
as
soldiers
miserably
equipped
a
cap
and
a
jacket
was
all
they
owed
to
art
nature
provided
the
rest
of
their
uniform
the
governor
orderly
alone
sported
a
pair
of
trousers
and
these
were
on
permanent
duty
being
transferred
from
one
to
the
other
as
their
turn
for
that
service
came
on
i
paid
my
respects
to
the
governor
who
although
a
portuguese
chose
to
follow
the
fashion
of
the
island
and
was
as
black
as
most
of
his
subjects
after
a
few
french
compliments
i
took
my
leave
i
was
curious
to
see
the
old
town
of
st
jago
which
had
been
abandoned
and
after
a
hot
walk
of
two
hours
over
uncultivated
ground
covered
with
fine
goats
which
are
the
staple
of
the
island
i
reached
the
desolate
spot
it
was
melancholy
to
behold
it
seemed
as
if
the
human
race
were
extinct
the
town
was
built
on
a
wide
ravine
running
down
to
the
sea
the
houses
were
of
stone
and
handsome
the
streets
regular
and
paved
which
proves
that
it
had
formerly
been
a
place
of
some
importance
but
it
is
surprising
that
a
spot
so
barren
as
this
island
generally
is
should
ever
have
had
any
mercantile
prosperity
whatever
it
did
enjoy
i
should
conceive
must
have
been
anterior
to
the
portuguese
having
sailed
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
the
solidity
and
even
elegance
of
construction
among
the
buildings
justifies
the
supposition
the
walls
were
massive
and
remained
entire
the
churches
were
numerous
but
the
roofs
of
them
and
the
had
mostly
fallen
in
trees
had
grown
to
a
considerable
height
in
the
midst
of
the
streets
piercing
through
the
pavements
and
raising
the
stones
on
each
side
and
the
convent
gardens
were
a
mere
wilderness
the
tree
had
thrust
its
head
through
many
a
roof
and
its
long
stems
through
the
tops
of
the
houses
the
banana
luxuriated
out
of
the
windows
the
only
inhabitants
of
a
town
capable
of
containing
ten
thousand
inhabitants
were
a
few
friars
who
resided
in
a
miserable
ruin
which
had
once
been
a
beautiful
convent
they
were
the
first
negro
friars
i
had
ever
seen
their
cowls
were
as
black
as
their
faces
and
their
hair
grey
and
woolly
i
concluded
they
had
adopted
this
mode
of
life
as
being
the
laziest
but
i
could
not
discover
by
what
means
they
could
gain
a
livelihood
for
there
were
none
to
give
them
anything
in
charity
the
appearance
of
these
poor
men
added
infinitely
to
the
necromantic
character
of
the
whole
melancholy
scene
there
was
a
beauty
a
loveliness
in
these
venerable
ruins
which
delighted
me
there
was
a
solemn
silence
in
the
town
but
there
was
a
small
still
voice
that
said
to
me
london
may
one
day
be
the
same
and
paris
and
you
and
your
children
children
will
all
have
lived
and
had
their
loves
and
adventures
but
who
will
the
wretched
man
be
that
shall
sit
on
the
summit
of
primrose
hill
and
look
down
upon
the
desolation
of
the
mighty
city
as
i
from
this
little
eminence
behold
the
once
flourishing
town
of
st
jago
the
goats
were
browsing
on
the
side
of
the
hill
and
the
little
kids
frisking
by
their
dams
these
thought
i
perhaps
are
the
only
food
and
nourishment
of
these
poor
friars
i
walked
to
port
praya
and
returned
to
my
floating
prison
the
slave
ship
the
officer
who
was
conducting
her
home
as
a
prize
was
not
a
pleasant
man
i
did
not
like
him
and
nothing
passed
between
us
but
common
civility
he
was
an
old
master
mate
who
had
probably
served
his
time
thrice
over
but
having
no
merit
of
his
own
and
no
friends
to
cause
that
defect
to
be
overlooked
he
had
never
obtained
promotion
he
therefore
naturally
looked
on
a
young
commander
with
envy
he
had
only
given
me
a
passage
home
from
motives
which
he
could
not
resist
first
because
he
was
forced
to
obey
the
orders
of
my
late
captain
and
secondly
because
my
purse
would
supply
the
cabin
with
the
necessary
stock
of
refreshments
in
the
shape
of
fruit
poultry
and
vegetables
which
are
to
be
procured
at
port
praya
he
was
therefore
under
the
necessity
of
enduring
my
company
the
vessel
i
found
was
not
to
sail
on
the
following
day
as
he
intended
i
therefore
took
my
gun
at
daybreak
and
wandered
with
a
guide
up
the
valleys
in
search
of
the
pintados
or
guinea
fowl
with
which
the
island
abounds
but
they
were
so
shy
that
i
never
could
get
a
shot
at
them
and
i
returned
over
the
hills
which
my
guide
assured
me
was
the
shortest
way
tired
with
my
walk
i
was
not
sorry
to
arrive
at
a
sheltered
valley
where
the
palmetto
and
the
plantain
offer
a
friendly
shade
from
the
burning
sun
the
guide
with
wonderful
agility
mounted
the
tree
and
threw
down
half
a
dozen
nuts
they
were
green
and
their
milk
i
thought
the
most
refreshing
and
delicious
draught
i
had
ever
taken
the
vesper
bells
at
port
praya
were
now
summoning
the
poor
black
friars
to
their
devotion
and
a
stir
and
bustle
appeared
among
the
little
black
boys
and
girls
of
whose
presence
i
was
till
then
ignorant
they
ran
from
the
coverts
and
assembled
near
the
front
of
the
only
cottage
visible
to
my
eye
a
tall
elderly
negro
man
came
out
and
took
his
seat
on
a
mound
of
turf
a
few
feet
from
the
cottage
he
was
followed
by
a
lad
about
twenty
years
of
age
who
bore
in
his
hand
a
formidable
cowskin
for
the
information
of
my
readers
i
must
observe
that
a
cowskin
is
a
large
whip
made
like
a
riding
whip
out
of
the
hide
of
the
hippopotamus
or
and
is
proverbial
for
the
severity
of
punishment
it
is
capable
of
inflicting
after
the
executioner
came
with
slow
and
measured
steps
the
poor
little
culprits
five
boys
and
three
girls
who
with
most
rueful
faces
ranged
themselves
rank
and
file
before
the
old
man
i
soon
perceived
that
the
hands
were
turned
up
for
punishment
but
the
nature
of
the
offence
i
had
yet
to
learn
nor
did
i
know
whether
any
order
had
been
given
to
strip
with
the
boys
this
would
have
been
supererogatory
as
they
were
quite
naked
the
female
children
had
on
cotton
chemises
which
they
slowly
and
reluctantly
rolled
up
until
they
had
gathered
them
close
under
their
armpits
the
old
man
then
ordered
the
eldest
boy
to
begin
his
pater
noster
and
simultaneously
the
elevated
his
cowskin
by
way
of
encouragement
the
poor
boy
watched
it
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
then
began
pattery
nobstur
qui
qui
qui
here
he
received
a
most
severe
lash
from
the
cowskin
bearer
is
in
silly
roared
the
boy
as
if
the
continuation
had
been
expelled
from
his
mouth
by
the
application
of
external
force
in
an
opposite
direction

roared
the
poor
fellow
as
he
saw
the
lash
descending
on
his
defenceless
back
terror
indeed

here
a
heavy
lash
brought
the
very
oh
that
was
caret
to
complete
the
sentence
my
readers
are
not
to
suppose
that
the
rest
of
the
class
acquitted
themselves
with
as
much
ability
as
their
leader
who
compared
to
them
was
perfectly
erudite
the
others
received
a
lash
for
every
word
or
nearly
so
the
boys
were
first
disposed
of
in
order
i
suppose
that
they
might
have
the
full
benefit
of
the
muscles
while
the
poor
girls
had
the
additional
pleasure
of
witnessing
the
castigation
until
their
turn
came
and
that
they
were
aware
of
what
awaited
them
was
evident
from
their
previous
arrangement
and
disposition
of
dress
at
the
commencement
of
the
entertainment
the
girls
accordingly
came
up
one
after
another
to
say
their
ave
maria
as
more
consonant
to
their
sex
but
i
could
scarcely
contain
my
rage
when
the
rascally
cowskin
was
applied
to
them
or
my
laughter
when
smarting
under
its
lash
they
exclaimed
benedicta

applying
their
little
hands
with
immoderate
pressure
to
the
afflicted
part
i
could
have
found
in
my
heart
to
have
wrested
the
whip
out
of
the
hands
of
the
young
negro
and
applied
it
with
all
my
might
to
him
and
his
old
villain
of
a
master
and
father
of
these
poor
children
as
i
soon
found
he
was
my
patience
was
almost
gone
when
the
second
girl
received
a
lash
for
her
plena
gratia
she
screamed
and
danced
and
lifted
up
her
poor
legs
in
agony
rubbing
herself
on
her
side
as
the
philadelphia
ladies
call
it
with
as
much
assiduity
as
if
it
had
been
one
of
those
cases
in
which
friction
is
prescribed
by
the
faculty
but
the
climax
was
yet
to
come
a
grand
stage
effect
was
to
be
produced
before
the
falling
of
the
curtain
the
youngest
girl
was
so
defective
in
her
lesson
that
not
one
word
of
it
could
be
extracted
from
her
even
by
the
cowskin
nothing
but
piercing
shrieks
enough
to
make
my
heart
bleed
could
the
poor
victim
utter
irritated
at
the
child
want
of
capacity
to
repeat
by
rote
what
she
could
not
understand
the
old
man
darted
from
his
seat
and
struck
her
senseless
to
the
ground
i
could
bear
no
more
my
first
impulse
was
to
wrest
the
cowskin
from
the
negro
hand
and
revenge
the
poor
bleeding
child
as
she
lay
motionless
on
the
ground
but
a
moment
reflection
convinced
me
that
such
a
step
would
only
have
brought
down
a
double
weight
of
punishment
on
the
victims
when
i
was
gone
so
catching
up
my
hat
i
turned
away
with
disgust
and
walked
slowly
towards
the
town
and
bay
of
port
praya
reflecting
as
i
went
along
what
pleasant
ideas
the
poor
creatures
must
entertain
of
religion
when
the
name
of
god
and
of
the
cowskin
were
invariably
associated
in
their
minds
i
began
to
parody
one
of
watts
hymns
lord
how
delightful
is
to
see
a
whole
assembly
worship
thee
the
indignation
i
felt
against
this
barbarous
and
ignorant
negro
was
not
unmingled
with
some
painful
recollections
of
my
own
younger
days
when
in
a
christian
and
protestant
country
the
bible
and
had
been
made
objects
of
terror
to
my
mind
tasks
greater
than
my
capacity
could
compass
and
floggings
in
proportion
were
not
calculated
to
forward
the
cause
of
religious
instruction
in
the
mind
of
an
obstinate
boy
reaching
the
i
embarked
on
board
of
my
slaver
and
the
next
day
sailed
for
england
we
had
a
favourable
passage
until
we
reached
the
chops
of
the
channel
when
a
gale
of
wind
from
the
caught
us
and
drove
us
down
so
far
to
the
southward
that
the
prize
master
found
himself
under
the
necessity
of
putting
into
bordeaux
to
refit
and
to
replenish
his
water
i
was
not
sorry
for
this
as
i
was
tired
of
the
company
of
this
officer
who
was
both
illiterate
and
neither
a
sailor
nor
a
gentleman
like
many
others
in
the
service
who
are
most
loud
in
their
complaints
for
want
of
promotion
i
considered
that
even
in
his
present
rank
he
was
what
we
called
a
hard
that
is
not
worth
his
salt
and
promoting
men
of
his
stamp
would
only
have
been
picking
the
pocket
of
the
country
as
soon
therefore
as
we
had
anchored
in
the
gironde
off
the
city
of
bordeaux
and
had
been
visited
by
the
proper
authorities
i
quitted
the
vessel
and
her
captain
and
went
on
shore
taking
up
my
abode
at
the
hôtel
my
first
care
was
to
order
a
good
dinner
and
having
despatched
that
and
a
bottle
of
vin
de
beaune
which
by
the
by
i
strongly
recommend
to
all
travellers
if
they
can
get
it
for
i
am
no
bad
judge
i
asked
my
de
how
i
was
to
dispose
of
myself
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
said
he
faut
aller
au
said
i
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
seated
in
the
of
the
handsomest
theatre
in
the
world
what
strange
events
what
unexpected
meetings
and
sudden
separations
are
sailors
liable
to
what
sudden
transitions
from
grief
to
joy
from
joy
to
grief
from
want
to
affluence
from
affluence
to
want
all
this
the
history
of
my
life
for
the
last
six
months
will
fully
illustrate
chapter
xxvi
you
will
proceed
in
pleasure
and
in
pride
beloved
and
loving
many
all
is
for
me
on
earth
except
some
years
to
hide
my
shame
and
sorrow
deep
in
my
heart
core
i
paid
little
attention
to
the
performance
for
the
moment
i
came
to
the
house
my
eyes
were
rivetted
on
an
object
from
which
i
found
it
impossible
to
remove
them
it
is
said
i
and
yet
it
can
not
be
and
yet
why
should
it
not
a
young
lady
sat
in
one
of
the
boxes
she
was
elegantly
attired
and
seemed
to
occupy
the
united
attentions
of
many
frenchmen
who
eagerly
caught
her
smiles
either
that
is
eugenia
thought
i
or
i
have
fallen
asleep
in
the
ruins
of
st
jago
and
am
dreaming
of
her
that
is
eugenia
or
i
am
not
frank
it
is
her
or
it
is
her
ghost
still
i
had
not
that
moral
certainty
of
the
identity
as
to
enable
me
to
go
at
once
to
her
and
address
her
indeed
had
i
been
certain
all
things
considered
the
situation
we
were
in
would
have
rendered
such
a
step
highly
improper
if
that
be
eugenia
thought
i
again
she
has
improved
both
in
manner
and
person
she
has
a
becoming
and
an
air
bon
which
when
we
parted
she
had
not
the
more
intensely
i
gazed
the
more
convinced
was
i
that
i
was
right
the
immovable
devotion
of
my
eyes
attracted
the
attention
of
a
french
officer
who
sat
near
me
une
jolie
femme
pas
said
i
do
you
know
her
name
madame
de
then
i
am
wrong
after
all
said
i
to
myself
has
she
a
husband
sir
elle
est
veuve
mais
elle
a
un
petit
garçon
de
cinq
ans
beau
comme
un
that
is
her
said
i
again
reviving
is
she
a
frenchwoman
tout
monsieur
elle
est
une
de
vos
compatriottes
un
fort
joli
she
had
only
been
three
months
at
bordeaux
and
had
refused
many
very
good
offers
in
marriage
such
was
the
information
i
obtained
from
my
obliging
neighbour
and
i
was
now
convinced
that
madame
de
rosenberg
could
be
no
other
than
eugenia
every
endeavour
to
catch
her
eye
proved
abortive
my
only
hope
was
to
follow
the
carriage
when
the
play
was
over
i
waited
with
an
impatience
like
that
of
a
spirited
hunter
who
hears
the
hounds
at
last
the
infernal
squalling
of
the
vocalists
ceased
but
not
before
i
had
devoutly
wished
that
all
the
wax
candles
in
the
house
were
down
their
throats
and
burning
there
i
saw
one
of
the
gentlemen
in
the
box
placing
the
shawl
over
her
shoulders
with
the
most
careful
attention
while
the
bystanders
seemed
ready
to
tear
him
in
pieces
from
envy
i
hurried
to
the
door
and
saw
her
handed
into
her
carriage
which
drove
off
at
a
great
pace
i
ran
after
it
jumped
up
behind
and
took
my
station
by
the
side
of
the
footman
donc
said
the
man
i
be
d
d
if
i
do
said
i
said
the
man
said
i
je
te
brulerai
la
f
said
the
man
who
behaved
very
well
and
instantly
began
to
remove
me
et
but
i
planted
a
stomacher
in
his
fifth
button
which
i
knew
would
put
him
de
for
a
few
minutes
and
by
that
time
at
the
rate
the
carriage
was
driving
my
purpose
would
have
been
answered
the
fellow
lost
his
breath
could
not
hold
on
or
speak
so
tumbled
off
and
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
road
as
he
fell
on
dry
ground
and
was
not
an
english
sailor
i
did
not
jump
after
him
but
left
him
to
his
own
ease
and
we
saw
no
more
of
him
for
we
were
going
ten
knots
while
he
lay
becalmed
without
a
breath
of
wind
this
was
one
of
the
most
successful
acts
of
usurpation
recorded
in
modern
history
it
has
its
parallels
i
know
but
i
can
not
now
stop
to
comment
on
them
or
on
my
own
folly
and
precipitation
i
was
as
firmly
fixed
behind
the
carriage
as
bonaparte
was
on
the
throne
of
france
after
the
battle
of
eylau
we
stopped
at
a
large
being
the
entrance
to
a
very
grand
house
with
lamps
at
the
door
within
a
spacious
court
yard
we
drove
in
and
drew
up
i
was
down
in
a
moment
opened
the
carriage
door
and
let
down
the
steps
the
lady
descended
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
without
perceiving
that
she
had
changed
her
footman
and
tripped
lightly
up
the
stairs
i
followed
her
into
a
handsome
saloon
where
another
servant
in
livery
had
placed
lights
on
the
table
she
turned
round
saw
me
and
fainted
in
my
arms
it
was
indeed
eugenia
herself
and
with
all
due
respect
to
my
dear
emily
i
borrowed
a
thousand
kisses
while
she
lay
in
a
state
of
torpor
in
a
fauteuil
to
which
i
carried
her
it
was
some
few
minutes
before
she
opened
her
eyes
the
who
had
brought
the
lights
very
properly
never
quitted
the
room
but
was
perfectly
respectful
in
his
manner
rightly
conceiving
that
i
had
some
authority
for
my
proceedings
my
dearest
frank
said
eugenia
what
an
unexpected
meeting
what
in
the
name
of
fortune
could
have
brought
you
here
that
said
i
is
a
story
too
long
eugenia
for
a
moment
so
interesting
as
this
i
also
might
ask
you
the
same
question
but
it
is
now
one
in
the
morning
and
therefore
too
late
to
begin
with
inquiry
this
one
question
however
i
must
ask
are
you
a
mother
i
am
said
eugenia
of
the
most
lovely
boy
that
ever
blessed
the
eyes
of
a
parent
he
is
now
in
perfect
health
and
fast
asleep
come
at
ten
and
you
shall
see
him
said
i
with
surprise
eugenia
why
am
i
to
quit
your
house
that
also
you
shall
know
said
she
but
now
you
must
do
as
you
are
desired
i
will
be
at
home
to
no
one
but
you
knowing
eugenia
as
i
did
it
was
sufficient
that
she
had
decided
there
was
no
appeal
so
kissing
her
again
i
wished
her
a
good
night
quitted
her
and
retired
to
my
hotel
what
a
night
of
tumult
did
i
pass
i
was
tossed
from
emily
to
eugenia
like
a
shuttlecock
between
two
battledores
the
latter
never
looked
so
lovely
and
to
the
natural
loveliness
of
her
person
was
added
a
grace
and
a
polish
which
gave
a
lustre
to
her
charms
which
almost
served
emily
as
i
had
served
the
footman
i
never
once
closed
my
eyes
during
the
night
dressed
early
the
next
morning
walked
about
looked
at
château
trompette
and
the
roman
ruins
thought
the
hour
of
ten
would
never
strike
and
when
it
did
i
struck
the
same
moment
at
her
door
the
man
who
opened
it
to
me
was
the
same
whom
i
had
treated
so
ill
the
night
before
the
moment
he
saw
me
he
put
himself
into
an
attitude
at
once
of
attack
defence
remonstrance
and
revenge
all
connected
with
the
affair
of
the
preceding
evening
ah
vous
voilà
donc
ce
pas
bienfait
said
i
nettement
fait
et
voilà
slipping
a
napoleon
into
his
hand
said
the
man
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
and
bowing
to
the
ground
madame
que
vous
voulez
said
i
he
led
i
followed
he
opened
the
door
of
a
breakfast
parlour
madame
voici
le
monsieur
que
renversé
hier
au
eugenia
was
seated
on
a
sofa
with
her
boy
by
her
side
the
loveliest
little
fellow
i
had
ever
beheld
his
face
was
one
often
described
but
rarely
seen
it
was
shaded
with
dark
curling
ringlets
his
mouth
eyes
and
complexion
had
much
of
his
mother
and
vanity
whispered
me
much
more
of
myself
i
took
a
seat
on
the
sofa
and
with
the
boy
on
my
knee
and
eugenia
by
my
side
held
her
hand
while
she
narrated
the
events
of
her
life
since
the
time
of
our
separation
a
few
days
said
she
after
your
departure
for
the
flushing
expedition
i
read
in
the
public
prints
that
the
nearest
relation
of
my
mother
would
call
at
in
london
they
would
hear
of
something
to
their
advantage
i
wrote
to
the
agent
from
whom
i
learned
after
proving
my
identity
that
the
two
sisters
of
my
mother
who
you
may
remember
had
like
sums
left
them
by
the
will
of
their
relative
had
continued
to
live
in
a
state
of
single
blessedness
that
about
four
years
previous
one
of
them
had
died
leaving
every
thing
to
the
other
and
that
the
other
had
died
only
two
months
before
bequeathing
all
her
property
to
my
mother
or
her
next
heir
or
in
default
of
that
to
some
distant
relation
i
therefore
immediately
came
into
a
fortune
of
ten
thousand
pounds
with
interest
and
i
was
further
informed
that
a
of
mine
was
still
living
without
heirs
and
was
most
anxious
that
my
mother
or
her
heirs
should
be
discovered
an
invitation
was
therefore
sent
to
me
to
go
down
to
him
and
to
make
his
house
my
future
residence
at
that
time
the
effects
of
my
indiscretion
were
but
too
apparent
and
rendered
as
i
thought
deception
justifiable
i
put
on
weeds
and
gave
out
that
my
husband
was
a
young
officer
who
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
fatal
walcheren
fever
that
our
marriage
had
been
clandestine
and
unknown
to
any
of
his
friends
such
was
my
story
and
appearance
before
the
agent
who
believed
me
the
same
fabrication
was
put
upon
my
with
equal
success
i
was
received
into
his
house
with
parental
affection
and
in
that
house
i
gave
birth
to
the
dear
child
you
now
hold
in
your
arms
to
your
child
my
frank
to
the
only
child
i
shall
ever
have
yes
dear
eugenio
continued
she
pressing
her
rosy
lips
on
the
broad
white
neck
of
the
child
you
shall
be
my
only
care
my
solace
my
comfort
and
my
joy
heaven
in
its
mercy
sent
the
cherub
to
console
its
wretched
mother
in
the
double
pangs
of
guilt
and
separation
from
all
she
loved
and
heaven
shall
be
repaid
by
my
return
to
its
slighted
its
insulted
laws
i
feel
that
my
sin
is
forgiven
for
i
have
besought
forgiveness
night
and
day
with
bitter
tears
and
heaven
has
heard
my
prayer
and
sin
no
more
was
said
to
me
and
upon
these
terms
i
have
received
forgiveness
you
will
no
doubt
ask
why
did
i
not
let
you
know
all
this
and
why
i
so
carefully
secreted
myself
from
you
my
reasons
were
founded
on
the
known
impetuosity
of
your
character
you
my
beloved
who
could
brave
death
and
all
the
military
consequences
of
desertion
from
a
ship
lying
at
spithead
were
not
likely
to
listen
to
the
suggestions
of
prudence
when
eugenia
was
to
be
found
and
having
once
given
out
that
i
was
a
widow
i
resolved
to
preserve
the
consistency
of
my
character
for
my
own
sake
for
your
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
this
blessed
child
the
only
drop
that
has
sweetened
my
cup
of
affliction
had
you
by
any
means
discovered
my
place
of
abode
the
peace
of
my
house
and
the
prospects
of
my
child
had
been
for
ever
blasted
now
then
say
frank
have
i
or
have
i
not
acted
the
part
of
a
roman
mother
my
having
declared
his
intention
of
making
me
heir
to
his
property
for
his
sake
and
yours
and
for
my
child
i
have
preserved
the
strict
line
of
duty
from
which
god
in
his
infinite
mercy
grant
that
i
may
never
depart
i
first
resolved
upon
not
seeing
you
until
i
could
be
more
my
own
mistress
and
when
at
the
death
of
my
respected
relative
i
was
not
only
released
from
any
restraint
on
account
of
his
feelings
but
also
became
still
more
independent
in
my
circumstances
you
might
be
surprised
that
i
did
not
immediately
impart
to
you
the
change
of
fortune
which
would
have
enabled
us
to
have
enjoyed
the
comfort
of
unrestricted
communication
but
time
reflection
the
conversation
and
society
of
my
uncle
and
his
select
friends
the
care
of
my
infant
and
the
reading
of
many
excellent
books
had
wrought
a
great
change
in
my
sentiments
having
once
tasted
the
pleasures
of
society
among
virtuous
women
i
vowed
to
heaven
that
no
future
act
of
mine
should
ever
drive
me
from
it
the
past
could
not
be
recalled
but
the
future
was
my
own
i
took
the
sacrament
after
a
long
and
serious
course
of
reading
and
having
made
my
vows
at
the
altar
with
the
help
of
god
they
are
unchangeable
dramatic
works
the
pernicious
study
and
poison
of
my
youthful
ardent
mind
i
have
long
since
discarded
and
i
had
resolved
never
to
see
you
again
until
after
your
marriage
with
miss
somerville
had
been
solemnised
start
not
by
the
simplest
and
easiest
means
i
have
known
all
your
movements
your
dangers
your
escapes
your
undaunted
acts
of
bravery
and
for
the
sake
of
others
i
then
said
i
to
myself
the
prospects
of
the
man
i
love
the
father
of
my
boy
shall
i
to
gratify
the
poor
pitiful
ambition
of
becoming
the
wife
of
him
to
whom
i
once
was
the
mistress
sacrifice
thus
the
hopes
and
fortune
of
himself
and
family
the
reward
of
a
virtuous
maiden
in
all
this
i
hope
you
will
perceive
a
proper
share
of
many
many
floods
of
bitter
tears
of
repentance
and
regret
have
i
shed
over
my
past
conduct
and
i
trust
that
what
i
have
suffered
and
what
i
shall
suffer
will
be
received
as
my
atonement
at
the
throne
of
grace
true
i
once
looked
forward
to
the
happy
period
of
our
union
when
i
might
have
offered
myself
to
you
not
as
a
portionless
bride
but
i
was
checked
by
one
maddening
burning
inextingishable
thought
i
could
not
be
received
into
that
society
to
which
you
were
entitled
i
felt
that
i
loved
you
frank
loved
you
too
well
to
betray
you
the
woman
that
had
so
little
respect
for
herself
was
unfit
to
be
the
wife
of
francis
mildmay
besides
how
could
i
do
my
sweet
boy
the
injustice
to
allow
him
to
have
brothers
and
sisters
possessing
legitimate
advantages
over
him
i
felt
that
our
union
never
could
be
one
of
happiness
even
if
you
consented
to
take
me
as
your
wife
of
which
i
had
my
doubts
and
when
i
discovered
through
my
emissaries
that
you
were
on
the
point
of
marriage
with
miss
somerville
i
felt
that
it
was
all
for
the
best
that
i
had
no
right
to
complain
the
more
so
as
it
was
i
who
i
blush
to
say
it
had
seduced
you
but
frank
if
i
can
not
be
your
wife
and
alas
i
know
too
well
that
that
is
impossible
will
you
allow
me
to
be
your
friend
your
dear
friend
as
the
mother
of
your
child
or
if
you
please
as
your
sister
but
there
the
sacred
line
is
drawn
it
is
a
compact
between
my
god
and
myself
you
know
my
firmness
and
decision
once
maturely
deliberated
my
resolution
formed
it
is
not
i
think
in
man
to
turn
me
do
not
therefore
make
the
attempt
it
will
only
end
in
your
certain
defeat
and
shame
and
in
my
withdrawing
from
your
sight
for
ever
you
will
not
i
am
sure
pay
me
so
bad
a
compliment
as
to
wish
me
to
renew
the
follies
of
my
youth
if
you
love
me
respect
me
promise
by
the
love
you
bear
to
miss
somerville
and
your
affection
for
this
poor
boy
that
you
will
do
as
i
wish
you
your
honour
and
peace
of
mind
as
well
as
mine
demand
it
this
severe
rebuke
from
a
quarter
whence
i
least
expected
it
threw
me
back
with
shame
and
confusion
as
if
a
mirror
had
been
held
up
to
me
i
saw
my
own
deformity
i
saw
that
eugenia
was
not
only
the
guardian
of
her
own
honour
but
of
mine
and
of
the
happiness
of
miss
somerville
against
whom
i
now
stood
convicted
of
foul
deceit
and
shameful
wrong
i
acknowledged
my
fault
i
assured
eugenia
that
i
was
bound
to
her
by
every
tie
of
honour
esteem
and
love
and
that
her
boy
and
mine
should
be
our
mutual
care
thank
you
dearest
said
she
you
have
taken
a
heavy
load
from
my
mind
henceforth
remember
we
are
brother
and
sister
i
shall
now
be
able
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
your
society
and
now
as
that
point
is
settled
let
me
know
what
has
occurred
to
you
since
we
parted
the
particulars
i
mean
for
the
outline
i
have
had
before
i
related
to
her
everything
which
had
happened
to
me
from
the
hour
of
our
separation
to
the
moment
i
saw
her
so
unexpectedly
in
the
theatre
she
was
alternately
affected
with
terror
surprise
and
laughter
she
took
a
hearty
crying
spell
over
the
motionless
bodies
of
clara
and
emily
as
they
lay
on
the
floor
but
recovered
from
that
and
went
into
hysterics
of
laughter
when
i
described
the
footman
mistake
and
the
slap
on
the
face
bestowed
on
him
by
the
housemaid
my
mind
was
not
naturally
corrupt
it
was
only
so
at
times
and
from
peculiar
circumstances
but
i
was
always
generous
and
easily
recalled
to
a
sense
of
my
duty
when
reminded
of
my
fault
not
for
an
empire
would
i
have
persuaded
eugenia
to
break
her
vow
i
loved
and
respected
the
mother
of
my
child
the
more
when
i
reflected
that
she
had
been
the
means
of
preserving
my
fidelity
to
emily
i
rejoiced
to
think
that
my
friendship
for
the
one
and
love
for
the
other
were
not
incompatible
i
wrote
immediately
to
emily
announcing
my
speedy
return
to
england
having
the
most
perfect
reliance
on
your
honour
i
shall
now
said
eugenia
accept
of
your
escort
to
london
where
my
presence
is
required
pierre
shall
accompany
us
he
is
a
faithful
creature
though
you
used
him
so
that
said
i
is
all
made
up
and
pierre
will
be
heartily
glad
of
another
tumble
for
the
same
price
all
our
arrangements
were
speedily
made
the
house
was
given
up
a
roomy
travelling
barouche
received
all
our
trunks
and
seated
by
the
side
of
eugenia
with
the
child
between
us
we
crossed
the
gironde
and
took
our
way
through
poictiers
tours
and
orleans
to
paris
here
we
remained
but
a
short
time
neither
of
us
were
pleased
with
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
french
but
as
they
have
been
so
fully
described
by
the
swarms
of
english
travellers
who
have
infested
that
country
with
their
presence
and
this
with
the
fruits
of
their
labours
i
shall
pass
as
quietly
through
france
as
i
hope
to
do
through
the
thames
tunnel
when
it
is
completed
but
not
before
eugenia
consulted
me
as
to
her
future
residence
and
here
i
own
i
committed
a
great
error
but
i
declare
to
heaven
without
any
criminal
intention
i
ventured
to
suggest
that
she
should
live
in
a
very
pretty
village
a
few
miles
from
hall
the
residence
of
mr
somerville
and
where
after
my
marriage
it
was
intended
that
i
should
continue
to
reside
with
emily
to
this
village
then
i
directed
her
to
go
assuring
her
that
i
should
often
ride
over
and
visit
her
much
as
i
should
enjoy
your
company
frank
said
eugenia
this
is
a
measure
fraught
with
evil
to
all
parties
nor
is
it
fair
dealing
towards
your
future
wife
unhappily
for
me
that
turn
for
duplicity
which
i
had
imbibed
in
early
life
had
not
forsaken
me
notwithstanding
the
warnings
i
had
received
and
the
promises
of
amendment
which
i
had
made
flattering
myself
that
i
intended
no
harm
i
overruled
all
the
scruples
of
the
excellent
eugenia
she
despatched
a
confidential
person
to
the
village
on
the
outskirts
of
which
he
procured
for
her
a
commodious
and
even
elegant
cottage
ornée
ready
furnished
she
went
down
with
her
child
and
pierre
to
take
possession
and
i
to
my
father
house
where
my
appearance
was
hailed
as
a
signal
for
a
grand
jubilee
clara
i
found
had
entirely
changed
her
unfavourable
opinion
of
sea
officers
induced
thereto
by
the
engaging
manners
of
my
friend
talbot
on
whom
i
was
delighted
to
learn
she
was
about
to
bestow
her
very
pretty
little
white
hand
at
the
altar
this
was
a
great
triumph
to
the
navy
for
i
always
told
clara
laughingly
that
i
never
would
forgive
her
if
she
quitted
the
service
and
as
i
entertained
the
highest
respect
for
talbot
i
considered
the
prospects
of
my
sister
were
very
bright
and
flattering
and
that
she
had
made
a
choice
very
likely
to
secure
her
happiness
rule
britannia
said
i
to
clara
blue
for
ever
the
next
morning
i
started
for
mr
somerville
where
i
was
of
course
received
with
open
arms
and
the
party
a
few
days
after
having
been
increased
by
the
arrival
of
my
father
with
clara
and
talbot
i
was
as
happy
as
a
human
being
could
be
six
weeks
was
the
period
assigned
by
my
fair
one
as
the
very
shortest
in
which
she
could
get
rigged
bend
new
sails
and
prepare
for
the
long
and
sometimes
tedious
voyage
of
matrimony
i
remonstrated
at
the
unconscionable
delay
long
as
it
may
appear
she
said
it
is
much
less
time
than
you
took
to
fit
out
your
fine
frigate
for
north
america
that
frigate
was
not
got
ready
even
then
by
any
hurry
of
mine
said
i
and
if
ever
i
come
to
be
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
i
shall
have
a
bright
eye
on
the
young
lieutenants
and
their
sweethearts
at
blackheath
particularly
when
a
ship
is
fitting
in
a
hurry
at
woolwich
much
of
this
kind
of
sparring
went
on
to
the
great
amusement
of
all
parties
meanwhile
the
ladies
employed
themselves
in
running
up
milliner
bills
and
their
papas
employed
themselves
in
discharging
them
my
father
was
particularly
liberal
to
emily
in
the
articles
of
plate
and
jewellery
and
mr
somerville
equally
kind
to
clara
emily
received
a
trinket
box
so
beautifully
fitted
and
so
well
filled
that
it
required
a
cheque
of
no
trifling
magnitude
to
cry
quits
with
the
jeweller
indeed
my
father
kindness
was
so
great
that
i
was
forced
to
beg
he
would
set
some
bounds
to
his
liberality
i
was
so
busy
and
so
happy
that
i
had
let
three
weeks
pass
over
my
head
without
seeing
eugenia
i
dreamed
of
her
at
last
and
thought
she
upbraided
me
and
the
next
day
full
of
my
dream
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
i
recommended
the
young
ladies
to
the
care
of
talbot
and
mounting
my
horse
rode
over
to
see
eugenia
she
received
me
kindly
but
she
had
suffered
in
her
health
and
was
much
out
of
spirits
i
inquired
the
reason
and
she
burst
into
tears
i
shall
be
better
frank
said
she
when
all
is
over
but
i
must
suffer
now
and
i
suffer
the
more
acutely
from
a
conviction
that
i
am
only
paying
the
penalty
of
my
own
crime
perhaps
continued
she
had
i
never
departed
from
virtue
i
might
at
this
moment
have
held
in
your
heart
the
envied
place
of
miss
somerville
but
as
the
righteous
decrees
of
providence
having
provided
punishment
to
tread
fast
in
the
footsteps
of
guilt
i
am
now
expiating
my
faults
and
i
have
a
presentiment
that
although
the
struggle
is
bitter
it
will
soon
be
over
god
will
be
done
and
may
you
my
dear
frank
have
many
many
happy
years
in
the
society
of
one
you
are
bound
to
love
before
the
unhappy
eugenia
here
she
sank
on
a
sofa
and
again
wept
bitterly
i
feel
said
she
now
but
it
is
too
late
i
feel
that
i
have
acted
wrongly
in
quitting
bordeaux
there
i
was
loved
and
respected
and
if
not
happy
at
least
i
was
composed
too
much
dependence
on
my
resolution
and
the
vanity
of
supposing
myself
superior
in
magnanimity
to
the
rest
of
my
sex
induced
me
to
trust
myself
in
your
society
dearly
alas
have
i
paid
for
it
my
only
chance
of
victory
over
myself
was
flight
from
you
after
i
had
given
the
irrevocable
sentence
by
not
doing
so
the
poison
has
again
found
its
way
to
my
heart
i
feel
that
i
love
you
that
i
can
not
have
you
and
that
death
very
shortly
must
terminate
my
intolerable
sufferings
this
affecting
address
pierced
me
to
the
soul
and
now
the
consequences
of
my
guilt
and
duplicity
rushed
upon
me
like
a
torrent
through
a
bursting
i
would
have
resigned
emily
i
would
have
fled
with
eugenia
to
some
distant
country
and
buried
our
sorrows
in
each
other
bosoms
and
in
a
state
of
irrepressible
emotion
i
proposed
this
step
to
her
what
do
i
hear
my
beloved
said
she
starting
up
with
horror
from
the
couch
on
which
she
was
sitting
with
her
face
between
her
knees
what
is
it
you
that
would
resign
home
friends
character
the
possession
of
a
virtuous
woman
all
for
the
polluted
smiles
of
an
hold
hold
my
eugenia
said
i
do
not
i
beseech
you
shock
my
ears
with
an
epithet
which
you
do
not
deserve
mine
mine
is
all
the
guilt
forget
me
and
you
will
still
be
happy
she
looked
at
me
then
at
her
sweet
boy
who
was
playing
on
the
carpet
but
she
made
no
answer
and
then
a
flood
of
tears
succeeded
it
was
indeed
a
case
of
singular
calamity
for
a
beautiful
young
creature
to
be
placed
in
she
was
only
in
her
year
and
lovely
as
she
was
nature
had
scarcely
had
time
to
finish
the
picture
the
regrets
which
subdued
my
mind
on
that
fatal
morning
may
only
be
conceived
by
those
who
like
me
have
led
a
licentious
life
have
for
a
time
buried
all
moral
and
religious
feeling
and
have
been
suddenly
called
to
a
full
sense
of
their
guilt
and
the
misery
they
have
entailed
on
the
innocent
i
sat
down
and
groaned
i
can
not
say
i
wept
for
i
could
not
weep
but
my
forehead
burned
and
my
heart
was
full
of
bitterness
while
i
thus
meditated
eugenia
sat
with
her
hand
on
her
forehead
in
a
musing
attitude
had
she
been
reverting
to
her
former
studies
and
thrown
herself
into
the
finest
conceivable
posture
of
the
tragic
muse
her
appearance
would
not
have
been
half
so
beautiful
and
affecting
i
thought
she
was
praying
and
i
think
so
still
the
tears
ran
in
silence
down
her
face
i
kissed
them
off
and
almost
forgot
emily
i
am
better
now
frank
said
the
poor
sorrowful
woman
do
not
come
again
until
after
the
wedding
when
will
it
take
place
she
inquired
with
a
trembling
and
a
faltering
voice
my
heart
almost
burst
within
me
as
i
told
her
for
i
felt
as
if
i
was
signing
a
warrant
for
her
execution
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
tenderly
embracing
her
endeavoured
to
divert
her
thoughts
from
the
mournful
fate
that
too
evidently
hung
over
her
she
became
tranquil
and
i
proposed
taking
a
stroll
in
the
adjoining
park
i
thought
the
fresh
air
would
revive
her
she
agreed
to
this
and
going
to
her
room
returned
in
a
few
minutes
to
her
natural
beauty
was
added
on
that
fatal
day
a
morning
dress
which
more
than
any
other
became
her
it
was
white
richly
trimmed
and
fashionably
made
up
by
a
celebrated
french
milliner
her
bonnet
was
white
muslin
trimmed
with
light
blue
ribbons
and
a
sash
of
the
same
colour
confined
her
slender
waist
the
little
eugenio
ran
before
us
now
at
my
side
and
now
at
his
mother
we
rambled
about
for
some
time
the
burthen
of
our
conversation
being
the
future
plans
and
mode
of
education
to
be
adopted
for
the
child
this
was
a
subject
on
which
she
always
dwelt
with
peculiar
pleasure
tired
with
our
walk
we
sat
down
under
a
clump
of
beech
trees
near
a
grassy
ascent
winding
among
the
thick
foliage
contrived
by
the
opulent
owner
to
extend
and
diversify
the
rides
in
his
noble
domain
eugenio
was
playing
around
us
picking
the
wild
flowers
and
running
up
to
me
to
inquire
their
names
the
boy
was
close
by
my
side
when
startled
at
a
noise
he
turned
round
and
exclaimed
oh
look
mamma
look
papa
there
is
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
i
turned
round
and
saw
mr
somerville
and
emily
on
horseback
within
six
paces
of
me
so
still
they
stood
so
mute
i
could
have
fancied
emily
a
figure
they
neither
breathed
nor
moved
even
their
very
horses
seemed
to
be
of
bronze
or
perhaps
the
unfortunate
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
made
me
think
them
so
they
had
come
as
unexpectedly
on
us
as
we
had
discovered
them
the
soft
turf
had
received
the
impression
of
their
horses
feet
and
returned
no
sound
and
if
they
snorted
we
had
either
not
attended
to
them
in
the
warmth
of
our
conversation
or
we
had
never
heard
them
i
rose
up
hastily
coloured
deeply
stammered
and
was
about
to
speak
perhaps
it
was
better
that
i
did
not
but
i
had
no
opportunity
like
apparitions
they
came
and
like
apparitions
they
vanished
the
avenue
from
whence
they
had
so
silently
issued
received
them
again
and
they
were
gone
before
eugenia
was
sensible
of
their
presence
chapter
xxvii
fare
thee
well
and
if
for
ever
still
for
ever
fare
thee
well
even
though
unforgiving
never
thee
shall
my
heart
rebel
byron
i
was
so
stunned
with
this
that
i
fell
senseless
to
the
ground
and
it
was
long
before
the
kind
attentions
and
assiduity
of
eugenia
could
restore
me
when
she
had
succeeded
my
first
act
was
one
of
base
ingratitude
cruelty
and
injustice
i
spurned
her
from
me
and
upbraided
her
as
the
cause
of
my
unfortunate
situation
she
only
replied
with
tears
i
quitted
her
and
the
child
without
bidding
them
adieu
little
thinking
i
should
never
see
them
again
i
ran
to
the
inn
where
i
had
left
my
horse
mounted
and
rode
back
to
hall
mr
somerville
and
his
daughter
had
just
arrived
and
emily
was
lifted
off
her
horse
and
obliged
to
be
carried
up
to
her
room
clara
and
talbot
came
to
enquire
what
had
happened
i
could
give
no
account
of
it
but
earnestly
requested
to
see
emily
the
answer
returned
was
that
miss
somerville
declined
seeing
me
in
the
course
of
this
day
which
in
point
of
mental
suffering
exceeded
all
i
had
ever
endured
in
the
utmost
severity
of
professional
hardship
an
explanation
had
taken
place
between
myself
my
father
and
mr
somerville
i
had
done
that
by
the
impulse
of
dire
necessity
which
i
ought
to
have
done
at
first
of
my
own
free
will
i
was
caught
at
last
in
my
own
snare
the
trains
of
the
devil
are
long
said
i
to
myself
but
they
are
sure
to
blow
up
at
last
the
consequence
of
the
explanation
was
my
final
dismissal
and
a
return
of
all
the
presents
which
my
father
and
myself
had
given
to
emily
my
conduct
though
blamable
was
not
viewed
in
that
heinous
light
either
by
my
father
or
mr
somerville
and
both
of
them
did
all
that
could
be
done
to
restore
harmony
clara
and
talbot
interposed
their
kind
offices
but
with
no
better
success
the
maiden
pride
of
the
inexorable
emily
had
been
alarmed
by
a
beautiful
rival
with
a
young
family
in
the
next
village
the
impression
had
taken
hold
of
her
spotless
mind
and
could
not
be
removed
i
was
false
fickle
and
deceitful
and
was
given
to
understand
that
miss
somerville
did
not
intend
to
quit
her
room
until
she
was
assured
by
her
father
that
i
was
no
longer
a
guest
in
the
house
under
these
painful
circumstances
our
remaining
any
longer
at
the
hall
was
both
useless
and
irksome
a
source
of
misery
to
all
my
father
ordered
his
horses
the
next
morning
and
i
was
carried
back
to
london
more
dead
than
alive
a
burning
fever
raged
in
my
blood
and
the
moment
i
reached
my
father
house
i
was
put
to
bed
and
placed
under
the
care
of
a
physician
with
nurses
to
watch
me
night
and
day
for
three
weeks
i
was
in
a
state
of
delirium
and
when
i
regained
my
senses
it
was
only
to
renew
the
anguish
which
had
caused
my
disorder
and
i
felt
any
sentiment
except
gratitude
for
my
recovery
my
dear
clara
had
never
quitted
me
during
my
confinement
i
had
taken
no
medicine
but
from
her
hand
i
asked
her
to
give
me
some
account
of
what
had
happened
she
told
me
that
talbot
was
gone
that
my
father
had
seen
mr
somerville
who
had
informed
him
that
emily
had
received
a
long
letter
from
eugenia
narrating
every
circumstance
exculpating
me
and
accusing
herself
emily
had
wept
over
it
but
still
remained
firm
in
her
resolution
never
to
see
me
more
and
i
am
afraid
my
dear
brother
said
clara
that
her
resolution
will
not
be
very
easily
altered
you
know
her
character
and
you
should
know
something
about
our
sex
but
sailors
they
say
go
round
the
world
without
going
into
it
this
is
the
only
shadow
of
an
excuse
i
can
form
for
you
much
as
i
love
and
esteem
you
you
have
hurt
emily
in
the
nicest
point
that
in
which
we
are
all
the
most
susceptible
of
injury
you
have
wounded
her
pride
which
our
sex
rarely
if
ever
forgive
at
the
very
moment
she
supposed
you
were
devoted
to
her
that
you
were
wrapped
up
in
the
anticipation
of
calling
her
your
own
and
counting
the
minutes
with
impatience
until
the
happy
day
arrived
with
all
this
persuasion
on
her
mind
she
comes
upon
you
as
the
traveller
out
of
the
wood
suddenly
comes
upon
the
poisonous
snake
in
his
path
and
can
not
avoid
it
she
found
you
locked
with
another
a
fortnight
before
marriage
and
with
the
fruits
of
unlawful
love
in
your
arms
what
woman
could
forgive
this
i
would
not
i
assure
you
if
tal
i
mean
if
any
man
were
to
serve
me
so
i
would
tear
him
from
my
heart
even
if
the
dissolution
of
the
whole
frame
was
to
be
the
certain
consequence
i
consider
it
a
kindness
to
tell
you
frank
that
you
have
no
hope
much
as
you
have
and
will
suffer
she
poor
girl
will
suffer
more
and
although
she
will
never
accept
you
she
will
not
let
your
place
be
supplied
by
another
but
sink
into
her
grave
you
like
all
other
men
will
forget
this
but
what
a
warning
ought
it
to
be
to
you
that
sooner
or
later
guilt
will
be
productive
of
misery
this
you
have
fully
proved
your
licentious
conduct
with
this
woman
has
ruined
her
peace
for
ever
and
divine
vengeance
has
dashed
from
your
lips
the
cup
which
contained
as
much
happiness
as
this
world
could
afford
nor
has
the
penalty
fallen
on
you
alone
the
innocent
who
had
no
share
in
the
crime
are
partakers
in
the
punishment
we
are
all
as
miserable
as
yourself
but
god
will
be
done
continued
she
as
she
kissed
my
aching
forehead
and
her
tears
fell
on
my
face
how
heavenly
is
the
love
of
a
sister
towards
a
brother
clara
was
now
everything
to
me
having
said
thus
much
to
me
on
the
subject
of
my
fault
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
she
had
not
been
niggardly
in
the
article
of
words
she
never
named
the
subject
again
but
sought
by
every
means
in
her
power
to
amuse
and
to
comfort
me
she
listened
to
my
exculpation
she
admitted
that
our
meeting
at
bordeaux
was
as
unpremeditated
as
it
was
unfortunate
she
condemned
the
imprudence
of
our
travelling
together
and
still
more
the
choice
of
a
residence
for
eugenia
and
her
son
clara
affectionate
attention
and
kind
efforts
were
unavailing
i
told
her
so
and
that
all
hopes
of
happiness
for
me
in
this
world
were
gone
for
ever
my
dear
dear
brother
said
the
affectionate
girl
answer
me
one
question
did
you
ever
pray
my
answer
will
pretty
well
explain
to
the
reader
the
sort
of
religion
mine
was
why
clara
said
i
to
tell
you
the
truth
though
i
may
not
exactly
pray
as
you
call
it
yet
words
are
nothing
i
feel
grateful
to
the
almighty
for
his
favours
when
he
bestows
them
on
me
and
i
believe
a
grateful
heart
is
all
he
requires
then
brother
how
do
you
feel
when
he
afflicts
you
that
i
have
nothing
to
thank
him
for
answered
i
then
my
dear
frank
that
is
not
religion
may
be
so
said
i
but
i
am
in
no
humour
to
feel
otherwise
at
present
so
pray
drop
the
subject
she
burst
into
tears
this
said
she
is
worse
than
all
shall
we
receive
good
from
the
hand
of
the
lord
and
shall
we
not
receive
evil
but
seeing
that
i
was
in
that
sullen
and
untameable
state
of
mind
she
did
not
venture
to
renew
the
subject
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
quit
my
room
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
my
father
who
though
deeply
concerned
for
my
happiness
said
he
was
quite
certain
that
any
attempt
at
reconciliation
would
be
useless
he
therefore
proposed
two
plans
and
i
might
adopt
whichever
was
the
most
likely
to
divert
my
mind
from
my
heavy
affliction
the
first
was
to
ask
his
friends
at
the
admiralty
to
give
me
the
command
of
a
sloop
of
war
the
second
that
i
should
go
upon
the
continent
and
having
passed
a
year
there
return
to
england
when
there
was
no
knowing
what
change
of
sentiment
time
and
absence
might
not
produce
in
my
favour
for
said
he
there
is
one
very
remarkable
difference
in
the
heart
of
a
man
and
of
a
woman
in
the
first
absence
is
very
often
a
cure
for
love
in
the
other
it
more
frequently
cements
and
consolidates
it
in
your
absence
emily
will
dwell
on
the
bright
parts
of
your
character
and
forget
its
blemishes
the
experiment
is
worth
making
and
it
is
the
only
way
which
offers
a
chance
of
success
i
agreed
to
this
but
said
i
as
the
war
with
france
is
now
over
and
that
with
america
will
be
terminated
no
doubt
very
shortly
i
have
no
wish
to
put
you
to
the
expense
or
myself
to
the
trouble
of
fitting
out
a
sloop
of
war
in
time
of
peace
to
be
a
for
great
lords
and
ladies
and
myself
to
be
neither
more
or
less
than
a
and
after
having
spent
your
money
and
mine
and
exhausted
all
my
civilities
to
receive
no
thanks
and
hear
that
i
am
esteemed
at
almack
only
tolerable
sea
brute
enough
a
ship
therefore
continued
i
i
will
not
have
and
as
i
think
the
continent
holds
out
some
novelty
at
least
i
will
with
your
consent
set
off
this
point
being
settled
i
told
clara
of
it
the
poor
girl
grief
was
immoderate
my
dearest
brother
i
shall
lose
you
and
be
left
alone
in
the
world
your
impetuous
and
unruly
heart
is
not
in
a
state
to
be
trusted
among
the
gay
and
frivolous
french
you
will
be
at
sea
without
your
compass
you
have
thrown
religion
overboard
and
what
is
to
guide
you
in
the
hour
of
trial
fear
not
dear
clara
said
i
my
own
energies
will
always
extricate
me
from
the
dangers
you
apprehend
alas
it
is
these
very
energies
which
i
dread
said
clara
but
i
trust
that
all
will
be
for
the
best
accept
said
she
of
this
little
book
from
poor
clara
and
if
you
love
her
look
at
it
sometimes
i
took
the
book
and
embracing
her
affectionately
assured
her
that
for
her
sake
i
would
read
it
when
i
had
completed
my
arrangements
for
my
foreign
tour
i
determined
to
take
one
last
look
at
hall
before
i
left
england
i
set
off
unknown
to
my
family
and
contrived
to
be
near
the
boundaries
of
the
park
by
dusk
i
desired
the
postboy
to
stop
half
a
mile
from
the
house
and
to
wait
my
return
i
cleared
the
paling
and
avoiding
the
direct
road
came
up
to
the
house
the
room
usually
occupied
by
the
family
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
i
cautiously
approached
the
window
mr
somerville
and
emily
were
both
there
he
was
reading
aloud
she
sat
at
the
table
with
a
book
before
her
but
her
thoughts
it
was
evident
were
not
there
she
had
inserted
her
taper
fingers
into
the
ringlets
of
her
hair
until
the
palms
of
her
hand
reached
her
forehead
then
bending
her
head
towards
the
table
she
leaned
on
her
elbows
and
seemed
absorbed
in
the
most
melancholy
reflections
this
too
is
my
work
said
i
this
fair
flower
is
blighted
and
withering
by
the
contagious
touch
of
my
baneful
hand
good
heaven
what
a
wretch
am
i
whoever
loves
me
is
rewarded
by
misery
and
what
have
i
gained
by
this
wide
waste
and
devastation
which
my
wickedness
has
spread
around
me
happiness
no
no
that
i
have
lost
for
ever
would
that
loss
were
all
would
that
comfort
might
visit
the
soul
of
this
fair
creature
and
another
but
i
dare
not
i
can
not
pray
i
am
at
enmity
with
god
and
man
yet
i
will
make
an
effort
in
favour
of
this
victim
of
my
baseness
o
god
continued
i
if
the
prayers
of
an
outcast
like
me
can
find
acceptance
not
for
myself
but
for
her
i
ask
that
peace
which
the
world
can
not
give
shower
down
thy
blessings
upon
her
alleviate
her
sorrows
and
erase
from
her
memory
the
existence
of
such
a
being
as
myself
let
not
my
hateful
image
hang
as
a
blight
upon
her
beauteous
frame
emily
resumed
her
book
when
her
father
had
ceased
reading
aloud
and
i
saw
her
wipe
a
tear
from
her
cheek
the
excitement
occasioned
by
this
scene
added
to
my
previous
illness
from
the
effects
of
which
i
had
not
sufficiently
recovered
caused
a
faintness
i
sat
down
under
the
window
in
hopes
that
it
would
pass
off
it
did
not
however
for
i
fell
and
lay
on
the
turf
in
a
state
of
insensibility
which
must
have
lasted
nearly
half
an
hour
i
afterwards
learned
from
clara
that
emily
had
opened
the
window
it
being
a
french
one
to
walk
out
and
recover
herself
by
the
bright
she
perceived
me
lying
on
the
ground
her
first
idea
was
that
i
had
committed
suicide
and
with
this
impression
she
shut
the
window
and
tottering
to
the
back
part
of
the
room
fainted
her
father
ran
to
her
assistance
and
she
fell
into
his
arms
she
was
taken
up
to
her
room
and
consigned
to
the
care
of
her
woman
who
put
her
to
bed
but
she
was
unable
to
give
any
account
of
herself
or
the
cause
of
her
disorder
until
the
following
day
for
my
own
part
i
gradually
came
to
my
senses
and
with
difficulty
regained
my
chaise
the
driver
of
which
told
me
i
had
been
gone
about
an
hour
i
drove
off
to
town
wholly
unaware
that
i
had
been
observed
by
any
one
much
less
by
emily
when
she
related
to
her
father
what
she
had
seen
he
either
disbelieved
or
affected
to
disbelieve
it
and
treated
it
as
the
effects
of
a
distempered
mind
the
phantoms
of
a
disordered
imagination
and
she
at
length
began
to
coincide
with
him
i
started
for
the
continent
a
few
days
afterwards
talbot
who
had
seen
little
of
clara
since
my
rejection
by
emily
and
subsequent
illness
offered
my
father
to
accompany
me
and
clara
was
anxious
that
he
should
go
as
she
was
determined
not
to
listen
to
any
thing
he
could
say
during
my
affliction
she
could
not
she
said
be
happy
while
i
was
miserable
and
gave
him
no
opportunity
of
conversing
with
her
on
the
subject
of
their
union
we
arrived
at
paris
but
so
abstracted
was
i
in
thought
that
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
any
thing
every
attention
of
talbot
was
lost
upon
me
i
continued
in
my
sullen
stupor
and
forgot
to
read
the
little
book
which
dear
clara
had
given
and
which
for
her
sake
i
had
promised
to
read
i
wrote
to
eugenia
on
my
arrival
and
disburthened
my
mind
in
some
measure
by
acknowledging
my
shameful
treatment
of
her
i
implored
her
pardon
and
by
return
of
post
received
it
her
answer
was
affectionate
and
consoling
but
she
stated
that
her
spirits
of
course
were
low
and
her
health
but
indifferent
for
many
days
my
mind
remained
in
a
state
of
listless
inanity
and
talbot
applied
or
suffered
others
to
apply
the
most
pernicious
stimulant
that
could
be
thought
of
to
rouse
me
to
action
taking
a
quiet
walk
with
him
we
met
some
friends
of
his
and
at
their
request
we
agreed
to
go
to
the
saloons
of
the
palais
royal
this
was
a
desperate
remedy
and
by
a
miracle
only
was
i
saved
from
utter
and
irretrievable
ruin
how
many
of
my
countrymen
have
fallen
victims
to
the
arts
practised
in
that
horrible
school
of
vice
i
dare
not
say
happy
should
i
be
to
think
that
the
infection
had
not
reached
our
own
shores
and
found
patrons
among
the
great
men
of
the
land
they
have
however
both
felt
the
consequences
and
been
forewarned
of
the
danger
have
no
excuse
was
that
i
had
been
excluded
from
the
society
of
those
i
loved
always
living
by
excitement
was
it
surprising
that
when
a
displayed
its
hoards
before
me
i
should
have
fallen
at
once
into
the
snare
for
the
first
time
since
my
illness
i
became
interested
and
laid
down
my
money
on
those
abhorred
tables
my
success
was
variable
but
i
congratulated
myself
that
at
length
i
had
found
a
stimulus
and
i
anxiously
awaited
the
return
of
the
hour
when
the
doors
would
again
be
opened
and
the
rooms
lighted
up
for
the
reception
of
company
i
won
considerably
and
night
after
night
found
me
at
the
table
for
avarice
is
insatiable
but
my
good
luck
left
me
and
then
the
same
motive
induced
me
to
return
with
the
hope
of
winning
back
what
i
had
lost
still
fortune
was
unpropitious
and
i
lost
very
considerable
sums
i
became
desperate
and
drew
largely
on
my
father
he
wrote
to
beg
that
i
would
be
more
moderate
as
twice
his
income
would
not
support
such
an
expenditure
he
wrote
also
to
talbot
who
informed
him
in
what
manner
the
money
had
been
expended
and
that
he
had
in
vain
endeavoured
to
divert
me
from
the
fatal
practice
finding
that
no
limits
were
likely
to
be
put
to
my
folly
my
father
very
properly
refused
to
honour
any
more
of
my
bills
maddened
with
this
intimation
for
which
i
secretly
blamed
talbot
i
drew
upon
eugenia
banker
bill
after
bill
until
the
sum
amounted
to
more
than
what
my
father
had
paid
at
length
a
letter
came
from
eugenia
it
was
but
a
few
lines
i
know
too
well
my
dearest
friend
said
she
what
becomes
of
the
money
you
have
received
if
you
want
it
all
i
can
not
refuse
you
but
remember
that
you
are
throwing
away
the
property
of
your
child
this
letter
did
more
to
rouse
me
to
a
sense
of
my
infamous
conduct
than
the
advice
of
talbot
or
the
admonitions
of
my
father
i
felt
i
was
acting
like
a
scoundrel
and
i
resolved
to
leave
off
gaming
one
night
more
said
i
and
then
if
i
lose
there
is
an
end
of
it
i
go
no
more
talbot
attended
me
he
felt
he
was
in
some
measure
the
cause
of
my
being
first
initiated
in
this
pernicious
amusement
and
he
watched
my
motions
with
unceasing
anxiety
the
game
was
et
i
threw
a
large
sum
on
the
red
i
won
left
the
stake
doubled
and
won
again
the
heap
of
gold
had
increased
to
a
large
size
and
still
remained
to
abide
the
chance
of
the
card
again
again
and
again
it
was
doubled
seven
times
had
the
red
card
been
turned
up
and
seven
times
had
my
gold
been
doubled
talbot
who
stood
behind
me
implored
and
begged
me
earnestly
to
leave
off
what
may
be
the
consequence
of
one
card
against
you
trust
no
more
to
fortune
be
content
with
what
you
have
got
that
muttered
i
talbot
is
of
no
use
i
must
have
more
again
came
up
the
red
to
the
astonishment
of
the
bystanders
and
to
their
still
greater
astonishment
my
gold
which
had
increased
to
an
enormous
heap
still
remained
on
the
table
talbot
again
entreated
me
not
to
tempt
fortune
foolishly
folly
said
i
talbot
has
already
been
committed
and
one
more
card
will
do
the
business
it
must
be
done
the
bankers
knowing
after
eight
red
cards
had
been
turned
up
how
great
the
chance
was
of
regaining
all
their
losses
by
a
double
or
quits
agreed
to
the
ninth
card
talbot
trembled
like
a
leaf
the
card
was
turned
it
came
up
red
and
the
bank
was
broke
here
all
play
ceased
for
that
night
the
losers
of
course
vented
their
feelings
in
the
most
blasphemous
execrations
while
i
quietly
collected
all
my
winnings
and
returned
home
in
a
with
talbot
who
took
the
precaution
of
requesting
the
attendance
of
two
these
were
each
rewarded
with
a
napoleon
now
talbot
said
i
i
solemnly
swear
as
i
hope
to
go
to
heaven
never
to
play
again
and
this
promise
i
have
most
religiously
kept
my
good
fortune
was
one
instance
in
ten
thousand
among
those
who
have
been
ruined
in
that
house
the
next
morning
i
refunded
all
i
had
drawn
upon
eugenia
and
all
my
father
had
supplied
me
with
and
there
still
remained
a
considerable
residue
determined
not
to
continue
in
this
vortex
of
dissipation
any
longer
where
my
resolution
was
hourly
put
to
the
test
talbot
and
myself
agreed
to
travel
down
to
brest
an
arsenal
we
were
both
desirous
of
seeing
chapter
xxviii
thou
art
a
traitor
arcite
and
a
fellow
false
as
thy
title
to
her
friendship
blood
and
all
the
ties
between
us
i
disclaim
you
are
mad
i
must
be
till
thou
art
worthy
arcite
it
concerns
me
and
in
this
madness
if
i
hazard
thee
and
take
thy
life
i
deal
but
truly
fie
sir
noble
we
quitted
paris
two
days
after
and
a
journey
of
three
days
through
an
uninteresting
country
brought
us
to
the
little
town
of
granville
on
the
in
the
channel
we
remained
at
this
delightful
place
some
days
and
our
letters
being
regularly
forwarded
to
us
brought
us
intelligence
from
england
my
father
expressed
his
astonishment
at
my
returning
the
money
drawn
for
and
trusted
unaccountable
as
the
restitution
appeared
that
i
was
not
offended
and
would
consider
him
my
banker
as
far
as
his
expenditure
and
style
of
living
would
permit
him
to
advance
eugenia
in
her
letters
reproached
herself
for
having
written
to
me
and
concluded
that
i
had
drawn
so
largely
upon
her
merely
to
prove
her
sincerity
she
assured
me
that
her
caution
to
me
was
not
dictated
by
selfishness
but
from
a
consideration
for
the
child
clara
letter
informed
me
that
every
attempt
even
to
servility
had
been
made
in
order
to
induce
emily
to
alter
her
determination
but
without
success
and
that
a
coolness
had
in
consequence
taken
place
and
almost
an
entire
interruption
of
the
intimacy
between
the
families
she
also
added
i
am
afraid
that
your
friend
is
even
worse
than
yourself
for
i
understand
that
he
is
engaged
to
another
woman
and
has
been
so
for
years
now
as
i
must
consider
that
the
great
tie
of
your
intimacy
is
his
supposed
partiality
to
me
and
as
i
conceive
you
are
under
a
false
impression
with
respect
to
his
sincerity
i
think
it
my
duty
to
make
you
acquainted
with
all
i
know
it
is
impossible
that
you
can
esteem
the
man
who
has
trifled
with
the
feelings
of
your
sister
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
next
letter
from
you
will
inform
me
of
your
having
separated
how
little
did
poor
clara
think
when
she
wrote
this
letter
of
the
consequences
likely
to
arise
from
it
that
in
thus
venting
her
complaints
she
was
exploding
a
mine
which
was
to
produce
results
ten
times
more
fatal
than
any
thing
which
had
yet
befallen
us
i
was
at
this
period
in
a
misanthropic
state
of
mind
hating
myself
and
every
one
about
me
the
company
of
talbot
had
long
been
endured
not
enjoyed
and
i
would
gladly
have
availed
myself
of
any
plausible
excuse
for
a
separation
true
he
was
my
friend
had
proved
himself
so
but
i
was
in
no
humour
to
acknowledge
favours
discarded
by
her
i
loved
i
discarded
every
one
else
talbot
was
a
log
and
a
chain
and
i
thought
i
could
not
get
rid
of
him
too
soon
this
letter
therefore
gave
me
a
fair
opportunity
of
venting
my
spleen
but
instead
of
a
cool
dismissal
as
clara
requested
i
determined
to
dismiss
him
or
myself
to
another
world
having
finished
reading
my
letter
i
laid
it
down
and
made
no
observation
talbot
with
his
usual
kind
and
benevolent
countenance
inquired
if
i
had
any
news
yes
i
replied
i
have
discovered
that
you
are
a
villain
that
is
news
indeed
said
he
and
strange
that
the
brother
of
clara
should
have
been
the
messenger
to
convey
it
but
this
is
language
frank
which
not
even
your
unhappy
state
of
mind
can
excuse
retract
your
words
i
repeat
them
said
i
you
have
trifled
with
my
sister
and
are
a
villain
had
this
been
true
it
was
no
more
than
i
had
done
myself
but
my
victims
had
no
brothers
to
avenge
their
wrongs
the
name
of
clara
replied
talbot
calms
me
believe
me
frank
you
are
mistaken
i
love
her
and
have
always
had
the
most
honourable
intentions
towards
her
yes
said
i
with
a
sarcastic
sneer
at
the
time
that
you
have
been
engaged
to
another
woman
for
years
to
one
or
the
other
you
must
acknowledge
yourself
a
scoundrel
i
do
not
therefore
withdraw
my
appellation
but
repeat
it
and
as
you
seem
so
very
patient
under
injuries
i
inform
you
that
you
must
either
meet
me
on
the
sands
this
evening
or
consent
to
be
stigmatised
with
another
name
still
more
revolting
to
the
feelings
of
an
englishman
enough
enough
frank
said
talbot
with
a
face
in
which
conscious
innocence
and
manly
fortitude
were
blended
you
have
said
more
than
i
ever
expected
to
have
heard
from
you
and
more
than
the
customs
of
the
world
will
allow
me
to
put
up
with
what
must
be
must
but
i
still
tell
you
frank
that
you
are
wrong
that
you
are
fatally
deluded
and
that
you
will
bitterly
repent
the
follies
of
this
day
it
is
yourself
with
whom
you
are
angry
and
you
are
venting
that
anger
on
your
friend
the
words
were
thrown
away
on
me
i
felt
a
secret
malignant
pleasure
which
blindly
impelled
me
forward
with
the
certainty
of
glutting
my
revenge
by
either
destroying
or
being
destroyed
my
sole
preparation
for
this
dreadful
conflict
was
my
pistols
no
other
did
i
think
of
not
even
the
chances
of
sending
my
friend
and
or
going
myself
into
the
presence
of
an
almighty
judge
my
mind
was
absorbed
in
secret
pleasure
at
the
idea
of
that
acute
misery
which
emily
would
suffer
if
i
fell
by
the
hand
of
talbot
i
repaired
to
the
rendezvous
where
i
found
talbot
waiting
he
came
up
to
me
and
again
said
frank
i
call
heaven
to
witness
that
you
are
mistaken
you
are
wrong
suspend
your
opinion
at
least
if
you
will
not
recall
your
words
totally
possessed
by
the
devil
and
not
to
be
convinced
till
too
late
i
replied
to
his
peaceful
overture
by
the
most
insulting
irony
you
were
not
afraid
to
fire
at
a
poor
boy
in
the
water
said
i
though
you
do
not
like
to
stand
a
shot
in
return
come
come
take
your
ground
be
a
man
stand
up
do
be
afraid
for
myself
said
talbot
with
a
firm
and
placid
resignation
of
countenance
i
have
no
fears
but
for
you
frank
i
have
great
cause
of
alarm
so
saying
he
snatched
up
the
loaded
pistol
which
i
threw
down
to
him
we
had
no
seconds
nor
was
there
any
person
in
sight
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
and
we
walked
to
the
water
edge
where
the
reflux
of
the
tide
had
left
the
sand
firm
to
the
tread
here
we
stood
back
to
back
the
usual
distance
was
fourteen
paces
talbot
refused
to
measure
his
but
stood
perfectly
still
i
walked
ten
paces
and
turned
round
ready
said
i
in
a
low
voice
we
both
raised
our
arms
but
talbot
instantly
dropping
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
said
i
can
not
fire
at
the
brother
of
clara
i
can
at
her
insulter
answered
i
and
taking
deliberate
aim
fired
and
my
ball
entered
his
side
he
bounded
gave
a
half
turn
round
in
the
air
and
fell
on
his
face
to
the
ground
how
sudden
are
the
transitions
of
the
human
mind
how
close
does
remorse
follow
the
gratification
of
revenge
the
veil
dropped
from
my
eyes
i
saw
in
an
instant
the
false
medium
the
deceitful
vision
which
had
thus
allured
me
into
what
the
world
calls
an
affair
of
honour
honour
good
heaven
had
made
me
a
murderer
and
the
voice
of
my
brother
blood
cried
out
for
vengeance
the
manly
and
athletic
form
which
one
minute
before
excited
my
most
malignant
hatred
when
now
prostrate
and
speechless
became
an
object
of
frantic
affection
i
ran
to
talbot
and
when
it
was
too
late
perceived
the
mischief
i
had
done
murder
cruelty
injustice
and
above
all
the
most
detestable
ingratitude
flashed
at
once
into
my
overcrowded
imagination
i
turned
the
body
round
and
tried
to
discover
if
there
were
any
signs
of
life
a
small
stream
of
blood
ran
from
his
side
and
about
two
feet
from
him
was
lost
in
the
absorbing
sand
while
from
the
violence
of
his
fall
the
sand
had
filled
his
mouth
and
nostrils
i
cleaned
them
out
and
staunching
the
wound
with
my
handkerchief
for
the
blood
flowed
copiously
at
every
respiration
i
sat
on
the
by
his
side
supporting
him
in
my
arms
i
only
exclaimed
would
to
god
the
shark
the
poison
the
sword
of
the
enemy
or
the
precipice
of
trinidad
had
destroyed
me
before
this
fatal
hour
talbot
opened
his
languid
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
me
with
a
glassy
stare
but
he
did
not
speak
suddenly
recollection
seemed
for
a
moment
to
return
he
recognised
me
and
o
god
his
look
of
kindness
pierced
my
heart
he
made
several
efforts
to
speak
and
at
last
said
in
broken
accents
and
at
long
and
painful
intervals
look
at
letter
read
all
explain
god
bless
his
head
fell
back
and
he
was
dead
oh
how
i
envied
him
had
he
been
ten
thousand
times
more
guilty
than
i
had
ever
supposed
him
it
would
have
given
no
comfort
to
my
mind
i
had
murdered
him
and
too
late
i
acknowledged
his
innocence
i
know
not
why
and
can
scarcely
tell
how
i
did
it
but
i
took
off
my
neckcloth
and
bound
it
tightly
round
his
waist
over
the
wound
the
blood
ceased
to
flow
i
left
the
body
and
returned
to
our
lodging
in
a
state
of
mental
prostration
and
misery
proportioned
to
the
heat
and
excitement
with
which
i
had
quitted
it
my
first
object
was
to
read
the
letters
which
my
poor
friend
had
referred
to
on
my
arrival
both
our
servants
were
up
my
hands
and
clothes
were
dyed
with
blood
and
they
looked
at
me
with
astonishment
i
ran
hastily
upstairs
to
avoid
them
and
took
the
the
key
of
which
i
knew
hung
to
his
seizing
the
poker
i
split
it
open
and
took
out
the
packet
he
mentioned
at
this
moment
his
servant
entered
the
room
mon
maître
monsieur
où
i
have
murdered
him
said
i
and
you
will
find
him
in
the
sands
near
the
and
continued
i
i
am
now
robbing
him
my
appearance
and
actions
seemed
to
prove
the
truth
of
my
assertion
the
man
flew
out
of
the
room
but
i
was
regardless
of
everything
and
even
wonder
why
i
should
have
given
my
attention
to
the
letters
at
all
especially
as
i
had
now
convinced
myself
of
talbot
innocence
the
packet
however
i
did
read
and
it
consisted
of
a
series
of
letters
between
talbot
and
his
father
who
had
engaged
him
to
a
young
lady
of
rank
and
fortune
without
consulting
him
mariage
de
which
talbot
had
resisted
in
consequence
of
his
attachment
to
clara
i
have
already
stated
that
talbot
was
of
high
aristocratic
family
and
this
marriage
being
wished
for
by
the
parents
of
both
parties
they
had
given
it
out
as
being
finally
settled
to
take
place
on
the
return
of
talbot
to
england
in
the
last
letter
the
father
had
yielded
to
his
entreaties
in
favour
of
clara
only
requesting
him
not
to
be
precipitate
in
offering
himself
as
he
wished
to
find
some
excuse
for
breaking
off
the
match
and
above
all
he
fatally
enjoined
profound
secrecy
till
the
affair
was
arranged
here
then
was
everything
explained
indeed
before
i
had
read
these
letters
my
mind
did
not
need
this
damning
proof
of
his
innocence
and
my
guilt
just
as
i
had
finished
reading
gens
entered
my
room
and
with
the
officers
of
justice
led
me
away
to
prison
i
walked
mechanically
i
was
conducted
to
a
small
building
in
the
centre
of
a
square
this
was
a
with
an
window
on
each
of
its
four
sides
but
without
glass
there
was
no
bench
or
table
or
anything
but
the
bare
walls
and
the
pavement
the
wind
blew
sharply
through
i
had
not
even
a
but
i
felt
no
cold
or
personal
inconvenience
for
my
mind
was
too
much
occupied
by
superior
misery
the
door
closed
on
me
and
i
heard
the
bolts
turn
there
was
not
an
observation
made
on
either
part
and
i
was
left
to
myself
well
said
i
fate
has
now
done
its
worst
and
fortune
will
be
weary
at
last
of
tormenting
a
wretch
that
she
can
sink
no
lower
death
has
no
terrors
for
me
and
after
death
but
even
in
my
misery
i
scarcely
gave
a
thought
to
what
might
happen
in
futurity
it
might
occasionally
have
obtruded
itself
on
my
mind
but
was
quickly
dismissed
i
had
adopted
the
atheistical
creed
of
the
french
revolution
death
is
eternal
sleep
and
the
sooner
i
go
to
sleep
the
better
thought
i
the
only
point
that
pressed
itself
on
my
mind
was
the
dread
of
a
public
execution
this
my
pride
revolted
at
for
pride
had
again
returned
and
resumed
its
empire
even
in
my
as
the
day
dawned
the
noise
of
the
carts
and
country
people
coming
into
the
square
with
their
produce
roused
me
from
my
reverie
for
i
had
not
slept
the
prison
was
surrounded
by
all
ages
and
all
classes
to
get
a
sight
of
the
english
murderer
and
the
light
and
the
air
were
stopped
out
of
each
window
by
human
faces
pressed
against
the
bars
i
was
gazed
at
as
a
wild
beast
and
the
children
as
they
sat
on
their
mothers
shoulders
to
look
at
me
received
a
moral
lesson
and
a
warning
at
my
expense
as
a
tiger
in
his
cage
wearies
the
eye
by
incessantly
walking
and
turning
so
i
paced
my
den
and
if
i
could
have
reached
one
of
the
impertinent
gazers
through
the
slanting
aperture
and
three
foot
wall
i
should
have
throttled
him
all
these
people
said
i
and
thousands
more
will
witness
my
last
moments
on
the
scaffold
stung
with
this
dreadful
thought
with
rage
i
searched
in
my
pockets
for
my
penknife
to
relieve
me
at
one
from
my
torments
and
apprehensions
and
had
i
found
it
i
should
certainly
have
committed
suicide
fortunately
i
had
left
it
at
home
or
it
would
have
been
buried
in
that
moment
of
frenzy
in
the
carotid
artery
for
as
well
as
others
i
knew
exactly
where
to
find
it
the
crowd
at
length
began
to
disperse
the
windows
were
left
except
now
and
then
an
urchin
of
a
boy
showed
his
ragged
head
at
the
grille
worn
out
with
bodily
fatigue
and
mental
suffering
i
was
going
to
throw
myself
along
upon
the
cold
stones
when
i
saw
the
face
of
my
own
servant
who
advanced
in
haste
to
the
window
of
the
prison
exclaiming
with
joy
mon
cher
maître
monsieur
talbot
pas
not
dead
exclaimed
i
falling
unconsciously
on
my
knees
and
lifting
up
my
clasped
hands
and
haggard
eyes
to
heaven
not
dead
god
be
praised
at
least
there
is
a
hope
that
i
may
escape
the
crime
of
murder
before
i
could
say
more
the
mayor
entered
my
with
the
officers
of
the
police
and
informed
me
that
a
had
been
held
that
my
friend
had
been
able
to
give
the
clearest
answers
to
all
their
questions
and
that
it
appeared
from
the
evidence
of
himself
that
it
was
an
affair
fairly
decided
that
the
brace
of
pistols
found
in
the
water
had
confirmed
his
assertions
and
therefore
continued
the
mayor
whether
your
friend
lives
or
dies
a
été
fait
en
règle
et
vous
êtes
so
saying
he
bowed
very
politely
and
pointed
to
the
door
nor
was
i
so
ceremonious
as
to
beg
him
to
show
me
the
way
out
i
ran
and
flew
to
the
apartment
of
talbot
who
had
sent
my
servant
to
say
how
much
he
wished
to
see
me
i
found
him
in
bed
as
i
entered
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
which
i
covered
with
kisses
and
bathed
with
my
tears
oh
talbot
said
i
can
you
forgive
me
he
squeezed
my
hand
and
from
exhaustion
let
it
fall
the
surgeon
led
me
out
of
the
room
saying
all
depends
on
his
being
kept
quiet
i
then
learned
that
he
owed
his
life
to
two
circumstances
the
first
was
my
having
bound
my
neckcloth
round
the
wound
the
other
was
that
the
duel
took
place
below
mark
the
tide
was
rising
when
i
left
him
and
the
cold
waves
as
they
rippled
against
his
body
had
restored
him
to
animation
in
this
state
he
was
found
by
his
servant
not
many
minutes
before
the
flood
would
have
covered
him
for
he
had
not
strength
to
remove
out
of
its
way
i
ascertained
also
that
the
ball
had
entered
his
liver
and
had
passed
out
without
doing
farther
injury
i
now
dressed
myself
and
devoutly
thanking
god
for
his
miraculous
preservation
took
my
seat
by
the
of
the
patient
which
i
never
quitted
until
his
perfect
recovery
when
this
was
happily
completed
i
wrote
to
my
father
and
to
clara
giving
both
an
exact
account
of
the
whole
transaction
clara
undeceived
made
no
scruple
of
acknowledging
her
attachment
talbot
was
requested
by
his
father
to
return
home
i
accompanied
him
as
far
as
calais
where
we
parted
and
in
a
few
weeks
after
i
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
that
my
sister
had
become
his
wife
left
to
myself
i
returned
slowly
and
much
depressed
in
spirits
to
quillac
where
ordering
i
threw
myself
into
my
travelling
carriage
into
which
my
valet
had
by
my
orders
previously
placed
my
luggage
where
are
you
going
to
monsieur
said
the
valet
diable
said
i
les
passeports
said
the
man
i
felt
that
i
had
sufficient
passports
for
the
journey
i
had
proposed
but
correcting
myself
said
to
switzerland
it
was
the
first
name
that
came
into
my
head
and
i
had
heard
that
it
was
the
resort
of
all
my
countrymen
whose
heads
hearts
lungs
or
finances
were
disordered
but
during
my
journey
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
any
thing
consequently
took
no
notes
which
my
readers
will
rejoice
at
because
they
will
be
spared
that
inexhaustible
supply
to
the
trunk
makers
a
tour
through
france
and
switzerland
i
travelled
night
and
day
for
i
could
not
sleep
the
allegory
of
io
and
the
in
the
heathen
mythology
must
surely
have
been
intended
to
represent
the
being
who
like
myself
was
tormented
by
a
bad
conscience
like
io
i
flew
and
like
her
was
i
pursued
by
the
eternal
wherever
i
went
and
in
vain
did
i
try
to
escape
it
i
passed
the
great
st
bernard
on
foot
this
interested
me
as
i
approached
it
the
mountains
below
and
the
alps
above
were
one
mass
of
snow
and
ice
and
i
looked
down
with
contempt
on
the
world
below
me
i
took
up
my
abode
in
the
convent
for
some
time
my
ample
contributions
to
the
box
in
the
chapel
made
me
a
welcome
sojourner
beyond
the
limited
period
allowed
to
travellers
and
i
felt
less
and
less
inclined
to
quit
the
scene
my
amusement
was
climbing
the
most
frightful
precipices
followed
by
the
large
and
faithful
dogs
and
viewing
nature
in
her
wildest
and
most
sublime
attire
at
other
times
when
bodily
fatigue
required
rest
i
sat
down
with
morbid
melancholy
in
the
receptacle
for
the
bodies
of
those
unfortunate
persons
who
had
perished
in
the
snow
there
would
i
remain
for
hours
musing
on
their
fate
the
purity
of
the
air
admitted
neither
putrefaction
or
even
decay
for
a
very
considerable
time
and
they
lay
to
all
appearance
as
if
the
breath
had
even
then
only
quitted
them
although
on
touching
those
who
had
been
there
for
years
they
would
often
crumble
into
dust
roman
catholics
we
know
are
ever
anxious
to
make
converts
the
prior
asked
me
whether
i
was
not
a
protestant
i
replied
that
i
was
of
no
religion
which
answer
was
i
believe
much
nearer
to
the
truth
than
any
other
i
could
have
given
the
reply
was
far
more
favourable
to
the
hopes
of
the
monks
than
if
i
had
said
i
was
a
heretic
or
a
moslem
they
thought
me
much
more
likely
to
become
a
convert
to
religion
since
i
had
none
of
my
own
to
oppose
to
it
the
monks
immediately
arranged
themselves
in
theological
order
with
the
whole
armour
of
faith
and
laid
constant
siege
to
me
on
all
sides
but
i
was
not
inclined
to
any
religion
much
less
to
the
one
i
despised
i
would
sooner
have
turned
turk
i
received
a
letter
from
poor
unhappy
eugenia
it
was
the
last
she
ever
wrote
it
was
to
acquaint
me
with
the
death
of
her
lovely
boy
who
having
wandered
from
the
house
had
fallen
into
a
where
he
was
found
drowned
some
hours
after
in
her
distracted
state
of
mind
she
could
add
no
more
than
her
blessing
and
a
firm
conviction
that
we
should
never
meet
again
in
this
world
her
letter
concluded
incoherently
and
although
i
should
have
said
in
the
morning
that
my
mind
had
not
room
for
another
sorrow
yet
the
loss
of
this
sweet
boy
and
the
state
of
his
wretched
mother
found
a
place
in
my
bosom
for
a
time
to
the
total
exclusion
of
all
other
cares
she
requested
me
to
hasten
to
her
without
delay
if
i
wished
to
see
her
before
she
died
i
took
leave
of
the
monks
and
travelled
with
all
speed
to
paris
and
thence
to
calais
reaching
quillac
hotel
i
received
a
shock
which
although
i
apprehended
danger
i
was
not
prepared
for
it
was
a
letter
from
eugenia
agent
announcing
her
death
she
had
been
seized
with
a
brain
fever
and
had
died
at
a
small
town
in
norfolk
where
she
had
removed
soon
after
our
last
unhappy
interview
the
agent
concluded
his
letter
by
saying
that
eugenia
had
bequeathed
me
all
her
property
which
was
very
considerable
and
that
her
last
rational
words
to
him
were
that
i
was
her
first
and
her
only
love
i
was
now
callous
to
suffering
my
feelings
had
been
racked
to
insensibility
like
a
ship
in
a
hurricane
the
last
tremendous
sea
had
swept
everything
from
the
decks
the
vessel
was
a
wreck
driving
as
the
storm
might
chance
to
direct
in
the
midst
of
this
devastation
i
looked
around
me
and
the
only
object
which
presented
itself
to
my
mind
as
worthy
of
contemplation
was
the
tomb
which
contained
the
remains
of
eugenia
and
her
child
to
that
i
resolved
to
repair
chapter
xxix
with
sorrow
and
repentance
true
father
i
trembling
come
to
you
i
arrived
at
the
town
where
poor
eugenia
had
breathed
her
last
and
near
to
which
was
the
cemetery
in
which
her
remains
were
deposited
i
went
to
the
inn
whence
after
having
dismissed
my
and
ordered
my
luggage
to
be
taken
up
to
my
room
i
proceeded
on
foot
towards
the
spot
i
was
informed
that
the
path
lay
between
the
church
and
the
bishop
palace
i
soon
reached
it
and
inquiring
for
the
sexton
who
lived
in
a
cottage
hard
by
requested
he
would
lead
me
to
a
certain
grave
which
i
indicated
by
tokens
too
easily
known
oh
you
mean
the
sweet
young
lady
as
died
of
grief
for
the
loss
of
her
little
boy
there
it
is
continued
he
pointing
with
his
finger
the
white
peacock
is
now
sitting
on
the
headstone
of
the
grave
and
the
little
boy
is
buried
beside
it
i
approached
while
the
humble
sexton
kindly
withdrew
that
i
might
without
witnesses
indulge
that
grief
which
he
saw
was
the
burthen
of
my
aching
heart
the
bird
remained
but
without
dressing
its
plumage
without
the
usual
air
of
surprise
and
vigilance
evinced
by
domestic
fowls
when
disturbed
in
their
haunts
this
poor
creature
was
moulting
its
feathers
were
rumpled
and
disordered
its
tail
ragged
there
was
no
beauty
in
the
animal
which
was
probably
only
kept
as
a
variety
of
the
species
and
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
it
had
been
placed
there
as
a
lesson
to
myself
in
its
modest
attire
in
its
melancholy
and
pensive
attitude
it
seemed
with
its
gaudy
plumage
to
have
dismissed
the
world
and
its
vanities
while
in
mournful
silence
it
surveyed
the
crowded
mementoes
of
eternity
this
is
my
office
not
thine
said
i
apostrophising
the
bird
which
alarmed
at
my
near
approach
quitted
its
position
and
disappeared
among
the
surrounding
tombs
i
sat
down
and
fixing
my
eyes
on
the
name
which
the
tablet
bore
ran
over
in
a
hurried
manner
all
that
part
of
my
career
which
had
been
more
immediately
connected
with
the
history
of
eugenia
i
remembered
her
many
virtues
her
for
my
honour
and
happiness
her
concealing
herself
from
me
that
i
might
not
blast
my
prospects
in
life
by
continuing
an
intimacy
which
she
saw
would
end
in
my
ruin
her
firmness
of
character
her
disinterested
generosity
and
the
refinement
of
attachment
which
made
her
prefer
misery
and
solitude
to
her
own
gratification
in
the
society
of
the
man
she
loved
she
had
alas
but
one
fault
and
that
fault
was
loving
me
i
could
not
drive
from
my
thoughts
that
it
was
through
my
unfortunate
and
illicit
connection
with
her
that
i
had
lost
all
that
made
life
dear
to
me
at
this
moment
and
not
once
since
the
morning
i
awoke
from
it
my
singular
dream
recurred
to
my
mind
the
thoughts
which
never
had
once
during
my
eventful
voyage
from
the
bahamas
to
the
cape
and
thence
to
england
presented
themselves
in
my
waking
hours
must
certainly
have
possessed
my
brain
during
sleep
why
else
should
it
never
have
occurred
to
my
rational
mind
that
the
connection
with
eugenia
would
certainly
endanger
that
intended
with
emily
it
was
eugenia
that
placed
emily
in
mourning
out
of
my
reach
and
as
it
were
on
the
top
of
the
rock
here
then
my
dream
was
explained
and
i
now
felt
all
the
horrors
of
that
reality
which
i
thought
at
the
time
was
no
more
than
the
effect
of
a
disordered
imagination
yet
i
could
not
blame
eugenia
the
poor
girl
had
fallen
a
victim
to
that
deplorable
and
sensual
education
which
i
had
received
in
the
cockpit
of
a
i
i
alone
was
the
culprit
she
was
friendless
and
without
a
parent
to
guide
her
youthful
steps
she
fell
a
victim
to
my
ungoverned
passions
maddened
with
anguish
of
head
and
heart
i
threw
myself
violently
on
the
grave
i
beat
my
miserable
head
against
the
tombstones
i
called
with
frantic
exclamation
on
the
name
of
eugenia
and
at
length
sank
on
the
turf
between
the
two
graves
in
a
state
of
stupor
and
exhaustion
from
which
a
copious
flood
of
tears
in
some
measure
relieved
me
i
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
wheels
and
the
trampling
of
horses
and
looking
up
i
perceived
the
bishop
carriage
and
four
with
pass
by
the
livery
and
colour
of
the
carriage
were
certainly
what
is
denominated
quiet
but
there
was
an
appearance
of
state
which
indicated
that
the
owner
had
not
entirely
renounced
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
this
wicked
world
and
my
spleen
was
excited
ay
sweep
along
i
bitterly
muttered
worthy
type
indeed
of
the
apostles
i
like
the
pride
that
apes
humility
is
that
the
way
you
teach
your
flock
to
all
and
follow
me
i
started
up
suddenly
saying
to
myself
i
will
seek
this
man
in
his
palace
and
see
whether
i
shall
be
kindly
received
and
consoled
or
be
repulsed
by
a
menial
the
thought
was
sudden
and
being
conceived
almost
in
a
state
of
frenzy
was
instantly
executed
let
me
try
said
i
whether
a
bishop
can
to
the
mind
diseased
as
well
as
a
country
curate
i
moved
on
with
rapidity
to
the
palace
more
in
a
fit
of
desperation
than
with
a
view
of
seeking
peace
of
mind
i
rang
loudly
and
vehemently
at
the
gate
and
asked
whether
the
bishop
was
at
home
an
elderly
domestic
who
seemed
to
regard
me
with
astonishment
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
desired
me
to
walk
into
an
while
he
announced
me
to
his
master
i
now
began
to
recall
my
scattered
senses
which
had
been
wandering
and
to
perceive
the
absurdity
of
my
conduct
i
was
therefore
about
to
quit
the
palace
into
which
i
had
so
rudely
intruded
without
waiting
for
my
audience
when
the
servant
opened
the
door
and
requested
me
to
follow
him
by
what
inscrutable
means
are
the
designs
of
providence
brought
about
while
i
thought
i
was
blindly
following
the
impulse
of
passion
i
was
in
fact
guided
by
unerring
wisdom
a
prey
to
desperate
and
irritated
feelings
i
anticipated
with
malignant
pleasure
that
i
should
detect
hypocrisy
that
one
who
ought
to
set
an
example
should
be
weighed
by
me
and
found
wanting
instead
of
which
i
stumbled
on
my
own
salvation
where
i
expected
to
meet
with
pride
and
scorn
i
met
with
humility
and
kindness
when
i
had
looked
around
on
the
great
circle
bounded
by
the
visible
horizon
and
could
perceive
no
friendly
port
in
which
i
might
lay
my
shattered
vessel
behold
it
was
close
at
hand
i
followed
the
servant
with
a
kind
of
stupid
indifference
and
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
a
old
man
between
sixty
and
seventy
years
of
age
his
whole
external
appearance
as
well
as
his
white
hairs
commanded
respect
amounting
almost
to
admiration
i
was
not
prepared
to
speak
which
he
perceived
and
kindly
began
as
you
are
a
stranger
to
me
i
fear
from
your
careworn
countenance
that
it
is
no
common
occurrence
which
has
brought
you
here
sit
down
you
seem
in
distress
and
if
it
is
in
my
power
to
afford
you
relief
you
may
be
assured
that
i
will
do
so
there
was
in
his
manner
and
address
an
affectionate
kindness
which
overcame
me
i
could
neither
speak
nor
look
at
him
but
laying
my
head
on
the
table
and
hiding
my
face
with
my
hands
i
wept
bitterly
the
good
bishop
allowed
me
reasonable
time
to
recover
myself
and
with
extreme
good
breeding
mildly
requested
that
if
it
were
possible
i
would
confide
to
him
the
cause
of
my
affliction
be
not
afraid
or
ashamed
my
good
lad
said
he
to
tell
me
your
sorrows
if
we
have
temporal
blessings
we
do
not
forget
that
we
are
but
the
almoners
of
the
lord
we
endeavour
to
follow
his
example
but
if
i
may
judge
from
appearance
it
is
not
pecuniary
aid
you
have
come
to
solicit
no
no
replied
i
it
is
not
money
that
i
want
but
choked
with
excess
of
feeling
i
could
say
no
more
this
is
indeed
a
more
important
case
than
one
of
mere
bodily
want
said
the
good
man
we
might
very
soon
supply
but
there
seems
something
in
your
condition
which
requires
our
more
serious
attention
i
thank
the
almighty
for
selecting
me
to
this
service
and
with
his
blessing
we
shall
not
fail
of
success
then
going
to
the
door
he
called
to
a
young
lady
who
i
afterwards
found
was
his
daughter
and
holding
the
door
as
he
spoke
that
i
might
not
be
seen
in
my
distress
said
caroline
my
dear
write
to
the
duke
and
beg
him
to
excuse
my
dining
with
him
tell
him
that
i
am
kept
at
home
by
business
of
importance
and
give
orders
that
i
be
not
interrupted
on
any
account
he
then
turned
the
key
in
the
door
and
drawing
a
chair
close
to
mine
begged
me
in
the
most
persuasive
manner
to
tell
him
every
thing
without
reserve
in
order
that
he
might
apply
such
a
remedy
as
the
case
seemed
to
demand
i
first
asked
for
a
glass
of
wine
which
was
instantly
brought
he
received
it
at
the
door
and
gave
it
to
me
with
his
own
hand
having
drank
it
i
commenced
the
history
of
my
life
in
a
brief
outline
and
ultimately
told
him
all
nearly
as
much
in
detail
as
i
have
related
it
to
the
reader
he
listened
to
me
with
an
intense
and
painful
interest
questioning
me
as
to
my
feelings
on
many
important
occasions
and
having
at
length
obtained
from
me
an
honest
and
candid
confession
without
any
extenuation
my
young
friend
said
he
your
life
has
been
one
of
peculiar
temptation
and
excess
much
to
deplore
much
to
blame
and
much
to
repent
of
but
the
state
of
feeling
which
induced
you
to
come
to
me
is
a
proof
that
you
now
only
require
that
which
with
god
help
i
trust
i
shall
be
able
to
supply
it
is
now
late
and
we
both
of
us
require
some
refreshment
i
will
order
in
dinner
and
you
must
send
to
the
inn
for
your
portmanteau
perceiving
that
i
was
about
to
answer
i
must
take
no
denial
resumed
he
you
have
placed
yourself
under
my
care
as
your
physician
and
you
must
follow
my
prescriptions
my
duty
is
as
much
more
important
compared
to
the
doctor
as
the
soul
is
to
the
body
dinner
being
served
he
dismissed
the
servants
as
soon
as
possible
and
then
asked
me
many
questions
relative
to
my
family
all
of
which
i
answered
without
reserve
he
once
mentioned
miss
somerville
but
i
was
so
overcome
that
he
perceived
my
distress
and
filling
me
a
glass
of
wine
changed
the
subject
if
i
thought
that
any
words
of
mine
could
do
justice
to
the
persuasive
discourses
of
this
worthy
bishop
i
would
have
benefited
the
world
by
making
them
public
but
i
could
not
do
this
and
i
trust
that
none
of
my
readers
will
have
so
much
need
of
them
as
i
had
myself
i
shall
therefore
briefly
state
that
i
remained
in
the
palace
ten
days
in
the
most
perfect
seclusion
every
morning
the
good
bishop
dedicated
two
or
three
hours
to
my
instruction
and
improvement
he
put
into
my
hands
one
or
two
books
at
a
time
with
marks
in
them
indicating
the
pages
which
i
ought
to
consult
he
would
have
introduced
me
to
his
family
but
this
i
begged
for
a
time
to
decline
being
too
much
depressed
and
out
of
spirits
and
he
indulged
me
in
my
request
of
being
allowed
to
continue
in
the
apartments
allotted
to
me
on
the
seventh
morning
he
came
to
me
and
after
a
short
conversation
informed
me
that
business
would
require
his
absence
for
two
or
three
days
and
that
he
would
give
me
a
task
to
employ
me
during
the
short
time
he
should
be
gone
he
then
put
into
my
hand
a
work
on
the
sacrament
this
said
he
i
am
sure
you
will
read
with
particular
attention
so
that
on
my
return
i
may
invite
you
to
the
feast
i
trembled
as
i
opened
the
book
fear
not
mr
mildmay
said
he
i
tell
you
from
what
i
see
of
your
symptoms
that
the
cure
will
be
complete
having
said
this
he
gave
me
his
blessing
and
departed
he
returned
exactly
at
the
end
of
three
days
and
after
a
short
examination
said
he
would
allow
me
to
receive
the
sacrament
and
that
the
holy
ceremony
should
take
place
in
his
own
room
privately
well
knowing
how
much
affected
i
should
be
he
brought
in
the
bread
and
wine
and
having
consecrated
and
partaken
of
them
himself
agreeably
to
the
forms
prescribed
he
made
a
short
extempore
prayer
in
my
behalf
when
he
had
done
this
he
advanced
towards
me
and
presented
the
bread
my
blood
curdled
as
i
took
it
in
my
mouth
and
when
i
had
tasted
the
wine
the
type
of
the
blood
of
that
saviour
whose
wounds
i
had
so
often
opened
afresh
in
my
guilty
career
and
yet
upon
the
merits
of
which
i
now
relied
for
pardon
i
felt
a
combined
sensation
of
love
gratitude
and
joy
a
lightness
and
buoyancy
of
spirits
as
if
i
could
have
left
the
earth
below
me
disburthened
of
a
weight
that
had
till
then
crushed
me
to
the
ground
i
felt
that
i
had
faith
that
i
was
a
new
man
and
that
my
sins
were
forgiven
and
dropping
my
head
on
the
side
of
the
table
i
remained
some
minutes
in
grateful
and
fervent
prayer
the
service
being
ended
i
hastened
to
express
my
acknowledgments
to
my
venerable
friend
i
am
but
the
humble
instrument
my
dear
young
friend
said
the
bishop
let
us
both
give
thanks
to
the
almighty
searcher
of
hearts
let
us
hope
that
the
work
is
perfect
for
then
you
will
be
the
occasion
of
in
heaven
and
now
continued
he
let
me
ask
you
one
question
do
you
feel
in
that
state
of
mind
that
you
could
bear
any
affliction
which
might
befall
you
without
repining
i
trust
sir
answered
i
that
i
could
bear
it
not
only
cheerfully
but
thankfully
and
i
now
acknowledge
that
it
is
good
for
me
that
i
have
been
in
trouble
then
all
is
right
said
he
and
with
such
feelings
i
may
venture
to
give
you
this
letter
which
i
promised
the
writer
to
deliver
with
my
own
hand
as
soon
as
my
eye
caught
the
superscription
gracious
heaven
exclaimed
i
it
is
from
my
emily
even
so
said
the
bishop
i
tore
it
open
it
contained
only
six
lines
which
were
as
follows
our
mutual
kind
friend
the
bishop
has
proved
to
me
how
proud
and
how
foolish
i
have
been
forgive
me
dear
frank
for
i
too
have
suffered
much
and
come
as
soon
as
possible
to
your
ever
affectionate
emily
this
then
was
the
object
of
the
venerable
bishop
absence
bending
beneath
age
and
infirmity
he
had
undertaken
a
journey
of
three
hundred
miles
in
order
to
ensure
the
temporal
as
well
as
eternal
welfare
of
a
perfect
stranger
to
effect
a
reconciliation
without
which
he
saw
that
my
worldly
happiness
was
incomplete
i
was
afterwards
informed
that
notwithstanding
the
weight
of
his
character
and
holy
office
he
had
found
emily
more
decided
in
her
rejection
than
he
had
anticipated
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
sharply
rebuked
her
for
her
pride
and
unforgiving
temper
that
she
could
be
brought
to
listen
with
patience
to
his
arguments
but
having
at
length
convinced
her
that
the
tenure
of
her
own
hopes
depended
on
her
forgiveness
of
others
she
relented
acknowledged
the
truth
of
his
remarks
and
her
undiminished
affection
for
me
while
she
made
this
confession
she
was
in
the
same
position
before
the
bishop
that
i
was
when
i
received
her
letter
on
my
knees
and
in
tears
he
gave
me
his
hand
raised
me
up
and
now
my
young
friend
said
he
let
me
give
you
one
caution
i
hope
and
i
trust
that
your
repentance
is
sincere
if
it
be
not
the
guilt
must
rest
on
your
head
but
i
trust
in
god
that
all
is
as
it
should
be
i
will
not
therefore
detain
you
any
longer
you
must
be
impatient
to
be
gone
refreshment
is
prepared
for
you
my
horses
will
take
you
the
first
stage
have
you
funds
sufficient
to
carry
you
through
for
it
is
a
long
journey
as
my
old
bones
can
testify
i
assured
him
that
i
was
sufficiently
provided
and
expressing
my
thanks
for
his
kindness
wished
that
it
was
in
my
power
to
prove
my
gratitude
put
me
to
the
test
my
lord
said
i
if
you
possibly
can
well
then
replied
he
i
will
when
the
day
for
your
union
with
miss
somerville
is
fixed
allow
me
to
have
the
pleasure
of
joining
your
hands
should
it
please
god
to
spare
me
so
long
i
have
removed
the
disease
but
i
must
trust
to
somebody
else
to
watch
and
prevent
a
relapse
and
believe
me
my
dear
friend
however
a
man
may
be
to
keep
in
the
straight
path
he
gains
no
little
support
from
the
guidance
and
example
of
a
lovely
and
virtuous
woman
i
promised
readily
all
he
asked
and
having
finished
a
slight
lunch
again
shook
hands
with
the
worthy
prelate
jumped
into
my
carriage
and
drove
off
i
travelled
all
night
and
the
next
day
was
in
the
society
of
those
i
loved
and
who
had
ever
loved
me
in
spite
of
all
my
perverseness
and
folly
a
few
weeks
after
emily
and
i
were
united
by
the
venerable
bishop
who
with
much
emotion
gave
us
his
benediction
and
as
the
prayer
of
the
righteous
man
availeth
much
i
felt
that
it
was
recorded
in
our
favour
in
heaven
mr
somerville
gave
the
bride
away
my
father
with
talbot
and
clara
were
present
and
the
whole
of
us
after
all
my
strange
vicissitudes
were
deeply
affected
at
this
reconciliation
and
union
