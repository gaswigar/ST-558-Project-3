february
i
am
sick
of
my
life
the
war
has
robbed
it
of
all
that
a
young
man
can
find
of
joy
i
look
at
my
mutilated
face
before
i
replace
the
black
patch
over
the
left
eye
and
i
realize
that
with
my
crooked
shoulder
and
the
leg
gone
from
the
right
knee
downwards
that
no
woman
can
feel
emotion
for
me
again
in
this
world
so
be
it
i
must
be
a
philosopher
mercifully
i
have
no
near
relations
mercifully
i
am
still
very
rich
mercifully
i
can
buy
love
when
i
require
it
which
under
the
circumstances
is
not
often
why
do
people
write
journals
because
human
nature
is
filled
with
egotism
there
is
nothing
so
interesting
to
oneself
as
oneself
and
journals
can
not
yawn
in
one
face
no
matter
how
lengthy
the
expression
of
one
feelings
may
be
a
clean
white
page
is
a
sympathetic
thing
waiting
there
to
receive

impressions
suzette
supped
with
me
here
in
my
last
night
when
she
had
gone
i
felt
a
beast
i
had
found
her
attractive
on
wednesday
and
after
an
excellent
lunch
and
two
benedictines
i
was
able
to
persuade
myself
that
her
tenderness
and
passion
were
real
and
not
the
result
of
some
thousands
of
francs
and
then
when
she
left
i
saw
my
face
in
the
glass
without
the
patch
over
the
socket
and
a
profound
depression
fell
upon
me
is
it
because
i
am
such
a
mixture
that
i
am
this
rotten
creature
an
american
grandmother
a
french
mother
and
an
english
father
paris
eton
cannes
continuous
traveling
some
years
of
living
and
enjoying
a
rich
orphan
the
war
fighting
a
zest
hitherto
undreamed
of
unconsciousness
agony
and
then
well
now
paris
again
for
special
treatment
why
do
i
write
this
down
for
posterity
to
take
up
the
threads
correctly
why
from
some
architectural
sense
in
me
which
must
make
a
beginning
even
of
a
journal
for
my
eyes
alone
start
upon
a
solid
basis
i
know
not
and
care
not
three
charming
creatures
are
coming
to
have
tea
with
me
they
had
heard
of
my
loneliness
and
my
savageness
from
maurice
they
burn
to
give
me
their
sympathy
and
have
tea
with
plenty
of
sugar
in
it
and
chocolate
cake
i
used
to
wonder
in
my
salad
days
what
the
brains
of
women
were
made
of
when
they
have
brains
the
cleverest
of
them
are
generally
devoid
of
a
logical
sense
and
they
seldom
understand
the
relative
value
of
things
but
they
make
the
charm
of
life
for
one
reason
or
another
when
i
have
seen
these
three
i
will
dissect
them
a
divorcée
a
war
widow
of
two
years
and
the
third
with
a
husband
fighting
all
maurice
assures
me
ready
for
anything
and
highly
attractive
it
will
do
me
a
great
deal
of
good
he
protests
we
shall
see
they
came
with
maurice
and
alwood
chester
of
the
american
red
cross
they
gave
little
shrill
screams
of
admiration
for
the
room
endroit
delicieux
what
english
yes
of
course
english
one
could
see
what
silver
and
cleaned
and
everything
of
a
and
the
hermit
so
with
his
air
yes
the
war
is
much
too
long
one
has
given
of
one
time
in
the
first
year
but
now
really
fatigue
has
overcome
one
and
surely
after
the
spring
offensive
peace
come
soon
and
one
must
live
they
smoked
continuously
and
devoured
the
chocolate
cake
then
they
had
liqueurs
they
were
so
well
dressed
and
so
lissome
they
wore
elastic
corsets
or
none
at
all
they
were
well
painted
cheeks
of
the
new
tint
rather
apricot
coloured
and
magenta
lips
they
had
arranged
themselves
when
they
had
finished
munching
bringing
out
their
gold
and
their
lip
grease
and
their
powder
and
the
divorcee
continued
to
endeavour
to
enthrall
my
senses
with
her
voluptuous
half
closing
of
the
eyes
while
she
reddened
her
full
mouth
they
spoke
of
the
theatre
and
the
last
about
their
the
last
liasons
the
last
passions
they
spoke
of
gabrielle
her
husband
was
killed
last
week
foolish
of
him
since
one
of
alice
among
the
ministers
could
easily
have
got
him
a
soft
job
and
one
must
always
help
one
friends
alice
adored
but
he
has
left
her
well
provided
for
gabrielle
will
look
well
in
her
crepe
and
there
it
is
war
is
war
voulez
vous
after
all
will
it
be
as
agreeable
if
peace
does
come
this
summer
one
will
be
able
to
dance
openly
that
will
be
nice
but
for
the
rest
it
may
be
things
will
be
more
difficult
and
there
may
be
complications
one
has
been
very
well
during
the
war
very
well
indeed
ce
pas
ma
cherie
ce
pas
thus
they
talked
the
widow
lover
is
married
maurice
tells
me
and
has
been
able
to
keep
his
wife
safely
down
at
their
place
in
landes
but
if
peace
should
come
he
must
be
and
the
wife
can
very
well
be
disagreeable
about
the
affair
the
divorcée
three
lovers
will
be
in
paris
at
the
same
time
the
married
one
husband
returned
for
good
yes
certainly
peace
will
have
its
drawbacks
the
war
knows
its
compensations
but
considerable
ones
when
they
had
departed
promising
to
return
very
soon
to
dinner
this
time
and
see
all
the
exquisite
burton
came
into
the
room
to
take
away
the
tea
things
his
face
was
a
mask
as
he
swept
up
the
cigarette
ash
which
had
fallen
upon
the
william
and
mary
english
lac
table
which
holds
the
big
lamp
then
he
carefully
carried
away
the
silver
ash
trays
filled
with
the
ends
and
returned
with
them
cleaned
then
he
coughed
slightly
shall
i
open
the
window
sir
nicholas
it
is
a
beastly
cold
evening
he
put
an
extra
log
on
the
fire
and
threw
the
second
casement
wide
you
enjoy
your
dinner
better
now
sir
he
said
and
left
me
shivering
i
wish
i
were
a
musician
i
could
play
to
myself
i
have
still
my
two
hands
though
perhaps
my
left
shoulder
hurts
too
much
to
play
often
my
one
eye
aches
when
i
read
for
too
long
and
the
stump
below
the
knee
is
too
tender
still
to
fit
the
false
leg
on
to
and
i
can
not
because
of
my
shoulder
use
my
crutch
overmuch
so
walking
is
out
of
the
question
these
trifles
are
perhaps
the
cause
of
my
ennui
with
life
i
suppose
such
women
as
those
who
came
fulfill
some
purpose
in
the
scheme
of
things
one
can
dine
openly
with
them
at
the
most
exclusive
restaurant
and
not
mind
meeting
one
relations
they
are
rather
more
expensive
than
the
others
pearl
necklaces
sables
essence
for
their
motor
cars
these
are
their
they
are
so
decorative
too
and
before
the
war
were
such
excellent
tango
partners
these
three
are
all
of
the
best
families
and
their
relations
stick
to
them
in
the
background
so
they
are
not
altogether
maurice
says
they
are
the
most
agreeable
women
in
paris
and
get
the
last
news
out
of
the
generals
they
are
seen
everywhere
and
coralie
the
married
one
wears
a
red
cross
uniform
sometimes
at
tea
if
she
happens
to
remember
to
go
into
a
hospital
for
ten
minutes
to
hold
some
poor
fellow
hand
yes
i
suppose
they
have
their
uses
there
are
a
horde
of
them
anyway
maurice
is
bringing
another
specimen
to
divert
me
american
this
time
over
here
for
war
work
maurice
says
one
of
the
cleverest
adventuresses
he
has
ever
met
and
i
am
still
irresistible
he
assures
me
so
i
must
be
careful
for
am
i
not
disgustingly
rich
burton
is
sixty
years
old
he
is
my
earliest
recollection
burton
knows
the
world
the
american
adventuress
delighted
me
she
was
so
shrewd
her
eyes
are
cunning
and
evil
her
flesh
is
round
and
firm
she
is
not
extremely
painted
and
her
dresses
are
quite
six
inches
below
her
knees
she
has
two
english
peers
in
tow
and
any
casual
americans
of
note
whom
she
can
secure
who
will
give
her
facilities
in
life
she
also
is
posing
for
a
and
virtuous
woman
and
an
ardent
war
worker
all
these
parasites
are
the
product
of
the
war
though
probably
they
always
existed
but
the
war
has
been
their
glorious
chance
there
is
a
new
verb
in
america
maurice
says
to
war
work
it
means
to
get
to
paris
and
have
a
splendid
time
their
is
surprising
to
hear
this
one
talk
one
would
think
she
ruled
all
the
politics
of
the
allies
and
directed
each
general
are
men
fools
yes
imbeciles
they
can
not
see
the
wiles
of
woman
perhaps
i
could
not
when
i
was
a
human
male
whom
they
could
love
love
did
i
say
love
is
there
such
a
thing
or
is
it
only
a
sex
excitement
for
the
moment
that
at
all
events
is
the
sum
of
what
these
creatures
know
do
they
ever
think
i
mean
beyond
planning
some
fresh
adventure
for
themselves
or
how
to
secure
some
fresh
benefit
i
can
not
now
understand
how
a
man
ever
marries
one
of
them
gives
his
name
and
his
honour
into
such
precarious
keeping
once
i
suppose
i
should
have
been
as
easy
a
prey
as
the
rest
but
not
i
have
too
much
time
to
think
i
fear
i
seem
to
find
some
ulterior
motive
in
whatever
people
say
or
do
another
american
lunched
with
me
a
bright
girl
an
heiress
of
the
breezy
jolly
kind
a
good
sort
before
the
war
whom
i
danced
with
often
she
told
me
quite
naturally
that
she
had
a
german
thigh
bone
being
polished
into
an
umbrella
handle
she
had
assisted
at
the
amputation
and
the
man
had
afterwards
died
a
really
cute
souvenir
she
assured
me
it
was
going
to
be
are
we
all
mad
no
wonder
the
finest
and
best
go
west
will
they
come
again
souls
of
a
new
race
when
all
these
putrid
beings
have
become
extinguished
by
time
i
hope
so
to
god
these
french
women
enjoy
their
crepe
veils
and
their
shoes
and
their
short
black
skirts
even
a
cousin
is
near
enough
for
the
trappings
of
can
any
of
us
feel
woe
now
i
think
not
maurice
has
his
uses
were
i
a
man
once
more
i
should
despise
maurice
he
is
so
good
a
creature
such
a
devoted
hanger
on
of
the
very
rich
and
faithful
too
does
he
not
pander
to
my
every
fancy
and
procure
me
whatever
i
momentarily
desire
how
much
better
if
i
had
been
killed
outright
i
loathe
myself
and
all
the
world
once
before
the
war
the
doing
up
of
this
flat
caused
me
raptures
to
get
it
quite
english
in
paris
every
in
london
had
exploited
me
to
his
heart
content
i
paid
for
it
through
the
nose
but
each
bit
is
a
gem
i
am
not
quite
sure
now
what
i
meant
to
do
with
it
when
finished
occupy
it
when
i
did
come
to
paris
lend
it
to
friends
i
do
remember
now
it
seems
a
sepulchre
where
i
can
retire
my
maimed
body
to
and
wait
for
the
end
nina
once
proposed
to
stay
with
me
here
no
one
should
know
nina
would
she
come
now
how
dare
they
make
this
noise
at
the
door
what
is
it
nina
it
was
actually
nina
herself
poor
darling
nicholas
she
said
the
kindest
fate
sent
me
across
i
a
passport
really
serious
war
work
and
here
i
am
for
a
fortnight
even
in
war
time
one
get
a
few
clothes
i
could
see
i
was
a
great
shock
to
her
my
attraction
for
her
had
gone
i
was
just
poor
darling
nicholas
and
she
began
to
be
motherly
nina
motherly
she
would
have
been
furious
at
the
very
idea
once
nina
is
years
old
her
boy
has
just
gone
into
the
flying
corps
she
is
so
glad
the
war
will
soon
be
over
she
loves
her
boy
she
gave
me
news
of
the
world
our
old
world
of
idle
uselessness
which
is
now
one
of
solid
work
why
have
you
completely
cut
yourself
off
from
everything
and
everybody
ever
since
you
first
went
out
to
fight
very
silly
of
you
when
i
was
a
and
could
fight
i
liked
fighting
and
never
wanted
to
see
any
of
you
again
you
all
seemed
rotters
to
me
so
i
spent
my
leaves
in
the
country
or
here
now
you
seem
glorious
beings
and
i
the
rotter
i
am
no
use
at
all
nina
came
close
to
me
and
touched
my
hand
poor
darling
nicholas
she
said
again
something
hurt
awfully
as
i
realized
that
to
touch
me
now
caused
her
no
thrill
no
woman
will
ever
thrill
again
when
i
am
near
nina
does
know
all
about
clothes
she
is
the
englishwoman
i
have
ever
seen
she
has
worked
awfully
well
for
the
war
too
i
hear
she
deserves
her
fortnight
in
paris
what
are
you
going
to
do
nina
i
asked
her
she
was
going
out
to
theatres
every
night
and
going
to
dine
with
lots
of
delicious
tabs
whose
work
was
over
here
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
a
long
time
i
just
going
to
frivol
nicholas
i
am
tired
of
work
nothing
could
exceed
her
kindness
a
mother
kindness
i
tried
to
take
an
interest
in
everything
she
said
only
it
seemed
such
aeons
away
as
though
i
were
talking
in
a
dream
she
would
go
plodding
on
at
her
war
job
when
she
got
back
again
of
course
but
she
like
everyone
else
is
war
weary
and
when
peace
comes
it
will
soon
come
now
probably
what
then
i
believe
i
shall
marry
again
i
jumped
i
had
never
contemplated
the
possibility
of
nina
marrying
she
has
always
been
a
widowed
institution
with
her
nice
little
house
in
queen
street
and
that
wonderful
cook
what
on
earth
for
i
want
the
companionship
and
devotion
of
one
man
anyone
in
view
yes
one
or
two
they
say
there
is
a
shortage
of
men
i
have
never
known
so
many
men
in
my
life
then
presently
when
she
had
finished
her
tea
she
said
you
are
absolutely
out
of
gear
nicholas
your
voice
is
rasping
your
remarks
are
bitter
and
you
must
be
awfully
unhappy
poor
boy
i
told
her
that
i
was
there
was
no
use
in
lying
everything
is
finished
i
said
and
she
bent
down
and
kissed
me
as
she
said
a
mother
kiss
and
now
i
am
alone
and
what
shall
i
do
all
the
evening
or
all
the
other
evenings
i
will
send
for
suzette
to
dine
suzette
was
amusing
i
told
her
at
once
i
did
not
require
her
to
be
affectionate
you
can
have
an
evening
rest
from
blandishments
suzette
and
then
she
stretched
herself
kicked
up
her
little
feet
in
their
podgy
little
shoes
with
heels
and
lit
a
cigarette
life
is
hard
she
told
me
and
now
that
the
english
are
here
it
is
difficult
to
keep
from
falling
in
love
for
a
minute
i
thought
she
was
going
to
insinuate
that
i
had
aroused
her
reflection
i
warmed
but
no
she
had
taken
me
seriously
when
i
told
her
i
required
no
blandishments
that
ugly
little
twinge
came
to
me
again
you
like
the
english
yes
why
they
are
very
they
are
clean
and
they
are
fine
men
they
have
sentiment
too
yes
it
is
difficult
not
to
feel
she
sighed
what
do
you
do
when
you
fall
in
love
then
suzette
i
immediately
go
for
a
fortnight
to
the
sea
one
is
lost
if
one
falls
in
love
le
the
man
tramples
then
tramples
and
slips
off
for
everything
good
one
must
never
feel
but
you
have
a
kind
heart
suzette
you
feel
for
me
and
she
showed
all
her
little
white
pointed
teeth
thou
thou
art
very
rich
women
will
always
feel
for
thee
it
went
in
like
a
knife
it
was
so
true
i
was
a
very
fine
englishman
once
i
said
it
is
possible
thou
art
still
sitting
and
showing
the
right
profile
and
full
of
and
then
rich
rich
you
could
not
forget
that
i
am
rich
suzette
if
i
did
i
might
love
you
and
does
the
sea
help
to
prevent
an
attack
absence
and
i
go
to
a
poor
place
i
knew
when
i
was
young
and
i
wash
and
cook
and
make
myself
remember
what
vie
was
and
would
be
again
if
one
loved
bah
that
does
it
i
come
back
cured
and
ready
only
to
please
such
as
thou
nicholas
rich
rich
and
she
laughed
again
her
rippling
gay
laugh
we
had
a
pleasant
evening
she
told
me
the
history
of
her
life
or
some
of
it
they
were
ever
the
same
from
lucien
myrtale
when
all
of
me
is
aching
shall
i
too
find
solace
if
i
go
to
the
sea
who
knows
ii
i
have
been
through
torture
this
week
the
new
man
wrenches
my
shoulder
each
day
it
will
become
straight
eventually
he
says
they
have
tried
to
fit
the
false
leg
also
so
those
two
things
are
going
on
but
the
socket
is
not
yet
well
enough
for
anything
to
be
done
to
my
left
eye
so
that
has
defeated
them
it
will
be
months
before
any
real
improvement
takes
place
there
are
hundreds
of
others
who
are
more
maimed
than
i
in
greater
pain
more
disgusting
does
it
give
them
any
comfort
to
tell
the
truth
to
a
journal
or
are
they
strong
enough
to
keep
it
all
locked
up
in
their
hearts
i
used
to
care
to
read
all
books
bore
me
now
i
can
not
take
interest
in
any
single
thing
and
above
all
i
loathe
myself
my
soul
is
angry
nina
came
again
to
luncheon
this
time
it
was
pouring
with
rain
an
odious
day
she
told
me
of
her
love
affairs
as
a
sister
might
nina
a
sister
she
ca
make
up
her
mind
whether
to
take
jim
bruce
or
rochester
moreland
they
are
both
brigadiers
now
jim
is
a
year
younger
than
she
is
rochester
is
really
more
my
mate
nicholas
she
said
but
then
there
are
moments
when
i
am
with
him
when
i
am
not
sure
if
he
would
not
bore
me
eventually
and
he
has
too
much
character
for
me
to
suppress
jim
fascinates
me
but
i
only
hold
him
because
he
is
not
sure
of
me
if
i
marry
him
he
will
be
and
then
i
shall
have
to
watch
my
looks
and
remember
to
play
the
game
all
the
time
and
it
wo
be
restful
above
all
i
want
rest
and
security
you
are
not
really
in
love
with
either
nina
love
and
she
smoothed
out
the
fringe
on
her
silk
jersey
with
her
hand
the
hand
i
once
loved
to
kiss
every
blue
vein
on
it
i
often
wonder
what
really
is
love
nicholas
i
thought
i
loved
you
before
the
war
but
of
course
i
could
not
have
because
i
feel
anything
now
and
if
i
had
really
loved
you
i
suppose
it
would
not
have
made
any
difference
then
she
realized
what
she
had
said
and
got
up
and
came
closer
to
me
that
was
cruel
of
me
i
did
not
mean
to
be
i
love
you
awfully
as
a
sister
always
sister
nina
well
let
us
get
back
to
love
perhaps
the
war
has
killed
it
or
it
has
developed
everything
perhaps
it
now
permits
a
sensitive
delicious
woman
like
you
to
love
two
men
you
see
we
have
become
so
complicated
she
puffed
smoke
rings
at
me
one
man
does
not
seem
to
fulfill
the
needs
of
every
mood
rochester
would
not
understand
some
things
that
jim
would
and
i
do
not
feel
any
glamour
about
either
but
it
is
rest
and
certainty
as
i
told
you
nicholas
i
am
so
tired
of
working
and
going
home
to
queen
street
alone
shall
you
toss
up
no
rochester
is
coming
up
from
the
front
just
for
the
night
i
am
going
to
dine
with
him
at
larue
alone
i
shall
sample
him
all
the
time
i
sampled
jim
when
he
was
last
in
london
a
fortnight
ago
you
will
tell
me
about
it
when
you
have
decided
wo
you
nina
you
see
i
have
become
a
brother
and
am
interested
in
the
psychological
aspects
of
things
of
course
i
will
then
she
went
on
meditatively
her
rather
plaintive
voice
low
i
think
all
our
true
feeling
is
used
up
nicholas
our
souls
if
we
have
souls
are
blunted
by
the
war
agony
only
our
senses
still
feel
when
jim
looks
at
me
with
his
attractive
blue
eyes
and
i
see
the
and
the
and
his
white
nice
teeth
and
how
his
hair
is
brushed
and
how
well
his
uniform
fits
i
have
a
jolly
sensation
and
i
do
much
listen
to
what
he
is
saying
he
says
lots
of
love
and
i
think
i
would
really
like
him
all
the
time
then
when
he
has
gone
i
think
of
other
things
and
i
feel
he
would
not
understand
a
word
about
them
and
because
he
is
there
i
do
feel
the
delicious
sensation
so
i
rather
decide
to
marry
rochester
there
would
be
such
risk
because
when
you
are
married
to
a
man
it
is
possible
to
get
much
fonder
of
him
jim
is
a
year
younger
than
i
am
it
would
be
a
strain
perhaps
in
a
year
or
two
especially
if
i
got
fond
you
had
better
take
the
richer
i
told
her
money
stands
by
one
it
is
an
attraction
which
even
the
effects
of
war
never
varies
or
lessens
and
i
could
hear
that
there
was
bitterness
in
my
voice
you
are
quite
right
nina
said
taking
no
notice
of
it
but
i
want
money
i
have
enough
for
every
possible
need
and
my
boy
has
his
own
i
want
something
kind
and
affectionate
to
live
with
you
want
a
master
and
a
slave
yes
nina
when
you
loved
me
what
did
you
want
just
you
nicholas
just
you
well
i
am
here
now
but
an
eye
and
a
leg
gone
and
a
crooked
shoulder
changes
me
so
it
is
true
love
even
the
emotion
of
the
soul
depends
upon
material
things
nina
thought
for
a
while
perhaps
not
the
emotion
of
the
soul
if
we
have
souls
but
what
we
know
of
love
now
certainly
does
i
suppose
there
are
people
who
can
love
with
the
soul
i
am
not
one
of
them
well
you
are
honest
nina
she
had
her
coffee
and
liqueur
she
was
graceful
and
composed
and
refined
either
jim
or
rochester
will
have
a
very
nice
wife
burton
coughed
when
she
had
left
out
with
it
burton
ardilawn
is
a
kind
lady
sir
nicholas
charming
i
believe
you
be
better
with
some
lady
to
look
after
you
sir
to
hell
with
you
telephone
for
maurice
i
do
want
any
woman
we
can
play
piquet
this
is
how
my
day
ended
maurice
and
piquet
then
the
widow
and
the
divorcée
for
dinner
and
now
alone
again
the
sickening
rot
of
it
all
nina
came
for
tea
she
feels
that
i
am
a
great
comfort
to
her
in
this
moment
of
her
life
so
full
of
indecision
it
seems
that
jim
has
turned
up
too
at
the
ritz
where
rochester
still
is
and
that
his
physical
charm
has
upset
all
her
calculations
again
i
am
really
very
worried
nicholas
she
said
and
you
who
are
a
dear
family
friend
i
am
a
family
friend
now
ought
to
be
able
to
help
me
what
the
devil
do
you
want
me
to
do
nina
outset
them
both
and
ask
you
to
marry
me
my
dearest
nicholas
it
seemed
to
her
that
i
had
suggested
that
she
should
marry
father
xmas
how
funny
you
are
once
it
was
the
height
of
her
desire
nina
is
eight
years
older
than
i
am
i
can
see
now
her
burning
eyes
one
night
on
the
river
in
the
june
of
when
she
insinuated
not
all
playfully
that
it
would
be
good
to
i
think
you
had
better
take
jim
my
dear
after
all
you
are
evidently
becoming
in
love
with
him
and
you
have
proved
to
me
that
the
physical
charm
matters
most
or
if
you
are
afraid
of
that
you
had
better
do
as
another
little
friend
of
mine
does
when
she
is
attracted
she
takes
a
fortnight
at
the
sea
the
sea
would
be
awful
in
this
weather
i
should
send
for
both
in
desperation
and
she
laughed
and
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
furnishings
of
my
flat
she
looked
over
it
and
burton
pointed
out
all
its
merits
to
her
my
crutch
hurts
my
shoulder
so
much
i
did
not
want
to
move
out
of
my
chair
i
could
hear
burton
remarks
but
they
fell
upon
unheeding
ears
nina
is
not
cut
out
for
a
nurse
my
poor
burton
if
you
only
knew
when
she
returned
to
my
sitting
room
tea
was
in
and
she
poured
it
out
for
me
and
then
she
remarked
we
have
grown
so
awfully
selfish
have
we
nicholas
but
we
such
hypocrites
as
we
were
before
the
war
people
still
have
lovers
but
they
do
turn
up
their
eyes
so
much
at
other
people
having
them
as
they
used
there
is
more
tolerance
the
only
thing
you
can
not
do
is
to
act
publicly
so
that
your
men
friends
can
not
defend
you
must
not
throw
your
bonnet
over
the
windmills
otherwise
you
can
do
as
you
please
you
had
not
thought
of
taking
either
jim
or
rochester
for
a
lover
to
make
certain
which
you
prefer
nina
looked
unspeakably
shocked
what
a
dreadful
idea
nicholas
i
am
thinking
of
both
not
only
to
pass
the
time
of
day
remember
that
is
all
lovers
are
for
then
nina
i
used
to
think
never
mind
what
you
thought
there
is
no
reason
to
insult
me
nothing
was
farther
from
my
desire
nina
face
cleared
as
it
had
darkened
ominously
what
will
you
do
if
having
married
rochester
you
find
yourself
bored
will
you
send
for
jim
again
certainly
not
that
would
be
disaster
i
sha
plunge
until
i
feel
pretty
certain
i
am
going
to
find
the
water
just
deep
enough
and
not
too
deep
and
if
i
do
make
a
mistake
well
i
shall
have
to
stick
to
it
by
jove
what
a
philosopher
and
i
laughed
she
poured
out
a
second
cup
of
tea
and
then
she
looked
steadily
at
me
as
though
studying
a
new
phase
of
me
you
are
not
a
bit
worse
off
than
tom
green
nicholas
and
he
has
not
got
your
money
and
tom
is
as
jolly
as
anything
and
everybody
loves
him
though
he
is
a
hopeless
cripple
and
ca
even
look
decent
as
you
will
be
able
to
in
a
year
or
two
there
is
no
use
in
having
this
sentiment
about
war
heroes
that
would
make
one
put
up
with
their
tempers
and
their
cynicism
everybody
is
in
the
same
boat
women
and
men
we
chance
being
maimed
by
bombs
and
we
are
losing
our
looks
with
rough
work
for
goodness
sake
stop
being
so
soured
i
laughed
outright
it
was
all
so
true
maurice
brings
people
to
play
bridge
every
afternoon
now
nina
has
gone
back
to
england
having
decided
to
take
jim
it
came
about
in
this
way
she
flew
in
to
tell
me
the
last
evening
before
she
left
for
havre
she
was
breathless
running
up
the
stairs
as
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
lift
jim
and
i
are
engaged
a
thousand
congratulations
rochester
had
a
dinner
for
me
on
wednesday
night
all
the
jolliest
people
in
paris
some
of
those
dear
french
who
have
been
so
nice
to
us
all
along
and
some
of
the
war
council
and
the
ryvens
and
so
on
and
do
you
know
nicholas
i
rochester
telling
madame
de
clerté
the
same
story
about
his
when
a
shell
broke
at
avicourt
as
i
had
already
heard
him
tell
admiral
short
and
daisy
ryven
that
decided
me
there
was
an
element
of
in
that
modest
story
and
a
man
who
would
tell
it
is
not
for
me
in
ten
years
i
should
grow
into
being
the
listener
victim
i
could
not
face
it
so
i
said
to
him
in
the
corridor
before
up
to
my
room
and
i
telephoned
to
jim
who
was
in
his
room
on
the
cambon
side
and
he
came
round
in
the
morning
was
rochester
upset
rather
but
a
man
of
his
age
he
is
who
can
tell
a
three
times
is
going
to
get
cured
soon
so
i
did
not
worry
and
what
did
jim
say
he
was
enchanted
he
said
he
knew
it
would
end
like
that
give
a
man
of
rope
enough
and
he
be
certain
to
hang
himself
he
said
and
oh
nicholas
jim
is
a
darling
he
is
getting
quite
masterful
i
adore
him
senses
winning
nina
women
only
like
physical
masters
she
grew
radiant
never
has
she
seemed
so
desirable
i
do
care
a
fig
nicholas
if
it
is
senses
well
then
i
know
it
is
the
best
thing
in
the
world
and
a
woman
of
my
age
ca
have
everything
i
adore
jim
we
are
going
to
be
married
the
first
moment
he
can
get
leave
again
and
i
shall
him
into
being
a
tab
he
has
fought
enough
and
if
meanwhile
he
should
get
maimed
like
me
what
then
nina
she
actually
paled
do
be
so
horrid
nicholas
jim
oh
i
ca
bear
it
and
being
a
strict
protestant
she
crossed
herself
to
avert
bad
luck
we
wo
think
of
anything
but
joy
and
happiness
nina
but
it
is
quite
plain
to
me
you
had
better
have
a
fortnight
at
the
sea
she
had
forgotten
the
allusion
and
turned
puzzled
brown
eyes
upon
me
you
know
to
balance
yourself
when
you
feel
you
are
falling
in
love
i
reminded
her
oh
it
is
all
stuff
and
nonsense
i
know
now
i
adore
jim
nicholas
and
she
hugged
me
as
a
sister
a
mother
and
a
family
friend
and
was
off
down
the
stairs
again
burton
had
brought
me
in
a
mild
gin
and
seltzer
and
it
was
on
the
tray
near
so
i
drank
it
and
said
to
myself
here
is
to
the
senses
jolly
good
things
and
then
i
telephoned
to
suzette
to
come
and
dine
there
is
a
mole
on
the
left
cheek
of
suzette
high
up
near
her
eye
there
are
three
black
hairs
in
it
i
had
never
seen
them
until
this
morning
ne
puis
of
course
we
have
all
got
moles
with
three
black
hairs
in
them
and
the
awful
moment
is
when
suddenly
they
are
seen
that
is
the
tragedy
of
life
disillusion
i
can
not
help
being
horribly
introspective
maurice
would
agree
to
whatever
i
said
so
there
is
no
use
in
talking
to
him
i
rush
to
this
journal
it
can
not
look
at
me
with
fond
watery
eyes
of
reproach
and
disapproval
as
burton
would
if
i
let
myself
go
to
him
the
times
have
been
too
anxious
to
write
it
is
over
two
months
since
i
opened
this
book
but
it
can
not
be
it
can
not
be
that
we
shall
be
beaten
oh
god
why
am
i
not
a
man
again
to
fight
the
raids
are
continuous
all
the
fluffies
and
nearly
everyone
left
paris
in
the
ticklish
march
and
april
times
but
now
their
fears
are
lulled
a
little
and
many
have
returned
and
they
rush
to
cinemas
and
theatres
to
kill
time
and
jump
into
the
rare
taxis
to
go
and
see
the
places
where
the
raid
bombs
burst
or
bertha
shells
and
watch
the
houses
burning
and
the
crushed
bodies
of
the
victims
being
dragged
out
they
sicken
me
this
rotten
crew
but
this
is
not
all
france
great
dear
brave
france
it
is
only
one
section
of
useless
society
the
duchesse
de
came
to
call
upon
me
mounted
all
the
stairs
without
even
a
wheeze
the
lift
gave
out
again
this
morning
what
a
personality
how
i
respect
her
she
has
worked
magnificently
since
the
war
began
her
hospital
is
a
wonder
her
only
son
was
killed
fighting
gloriously
at
verdun
you
look
as
melancholy
as
a
sick
cat
she
told
me
she
likes
to
speak
her
english
of
what
good
we
are
not
done
yet
i
have
cut
some
of
my
relatives
who
ran
away
from
paris
imbeciles
bertha
is
our
diversion
now
and
the
raids
at
night
jolly
loud
things
and
she
chuckled
detaching
her
scissors
which
had
got
caught
in
the
purple
woolen
jersey
she
wore
over
her
red
cross
uniform
she
is
quite
indifferent
to
coquetry
this
grande
dame
of
the
my
rejoice
in
them
voulez
vous
war
is
war
and
there
is
no
use
in
looking
blue
cheer
up
young
man
then
we
talked
of
other
things
she
is
witty
and
downright
and
her
every
thought
and
action
is
kindly
i
love
la
duchesse
my
mother
was
her
dearest
friend
when
she
had
stayed
twenty
minutes
she
came
over
close
to
my
chair
i
knew
you
would
be
bitter
at
not
being
in
the
fight
my
son
she
said
patting
me
with
her
once
beautiful
hand
now
red
and
hardened
with
work
so
i
snatched
the
moments
to
come
to
see
you
on
your
one
leg
you
defend
if
the
moment
should
come
but
it
wo
and
you
you
wounded
ones
spared
can
keep
the
courage
up
you
can
at
least
pray
you
have
the
time
i
have
not
le
bon
understands
and
with
that
she
left
me
stopping
to
arrange
her
tightly
curled
fringe
she
sticks
to
all
old
styles
at
the
lac
mirror
by
the
door
i
felt
better
after
she
had
gone
yes
it
is
that
god
why
ca
i
fight
iii
is
some
nerve
being
touched
by
the
new
treatment
i
seem
alternately
to
be
numb
and
perfectly
indifferent
to
how
the
war
is
going
and
then
madly
interested
but
i
am
too
sensitive
to
leave
my
flat
for
any
meals
i
drive
whenever
one
of
the
fluffies
this
is
what
maurice
calls
the
widow
the
divorcée
and
other
rejoicers
of
men
war
hearts
can
take
me
in
her
motor
no
one
else
has
a
motor
there
is
no
petrol
for
ordinary
people
it
reminds
one
of
louis
xv
supposed
reply
to
his
daughters
i
said
to
maurice
yesterday
when
they
asked
him
to
make
them
a
good
road
to
the
château
of
their
dear
the
duchesse
de
la
bove
he
assured
them
he
could
not
his
mistresses
cost
him
too
much
so
they
paid
for
it
themselves
hence
the
des
what
reminds
you
of
what
maurice
asked
looking
horribly
puzzled
the
fluffies
being
able
to
get
the
petrol
but
i
do
see
the
connection
it
was
involved
the
mistresses
got
the
money
which
should
have
made
the
road
in
those
days
and
now
maurice
was
annoyed
with
himself
he
could
not
yet
see
and
no
wonder
for
it
involved
but
i
am
angry
that
the
widow
and
the
divorcée
both
have
motors
and
i
none
poor
odette
she
hates
taxis
why
should
she
not
have
a
motor
you
are
since
she
takes
you
out
too
believe
me
maurice
i
am
grateful
i
shall
repay
all
their
kindnesses
they
have
all
indicated
how
i
can
best
do
so
but
i
like
to
keep
them
waiting
it
makes
them
more
keen
maurice
laughed
again
nervously
it
is
divine
to
be
so
rich
nicholas
all
sorts
of
people
come
to
talk
to
me
and
have
tea
i
have
a
small
hoard
of
sugar
sent
from
a
friend
in
spain
amongst
them
an
ancient
guardsman
in
some
inspection
berth
here
he
like
burton
knows
the
world
he
tests
women
by
whether
or
no
they
take
presents
from
him
he
tells
me
they
profess
intense
love
which
he
returns
and
then
comes
the
moment
he
like
me
is
disgustingly
rich
he
offers
them
a
present
some
accept
at
once
those
he
no
longer
considers
others
hesitate
and
say
it
is
too
much
they
only
want
his
affection
he
presses
them
they
yield
they
too
are
wiped
off
the
list
and
now
he
has
no
one
to
care
for
since
he
has
not
been
able
to
find
one
who
refuses
his
gifts
it
would
be
certainly
my
case
also
were
i
to
try
women
he
said
to
me
last
night
are
the
only
pleasure
in
life
men
and
hunting
bring
content
and
happiness
work
brings
satisfaction
but
women
and
their
ways
are
the
only
even
when
you
know
it
is
all
for
some
personal
gain
even
so
once
you
have
realized
that
it
does
not
matter
you
take
the
joy
from
another
point
of
view
you
have
to
eliminate
vanity
out
of
the
affair
your
personal
vanity
is
hurt
my
dear
boy
when
you
feel
it
is
your
possessions
not
yourself
they
crave
but
if
you
analyse
that
it
does
not
take
away
from
the
pleasure
their
beauty
gives
you
the
tangible
things
are
there
just
as
if
they
loved
you
i
am
now
altogether
indifferent
as
to
their
feelings
for
me
as
long
as
their
table
manners
are
good
and
they
make
a
semblance
of
adoring
me
if
one
had
to
depend
upon
their
real
disinterested
love
for
their
kindness
to
one
then
it
would
be
a
different
matter
and
very
distressing
but
since
they
can
always
be
caught
by
a
bauble
you
and
i
are
fortunately
placed
nicholas
we
laughed
our
vile
laughs
it
is
true
i
hate
to
hear
my
own
laugh
i
agree
with
chesterfield
who
said
that
no
gentleman
should
make
that
noise
as
i
said
before
all
sorts
of
people
come
to
see
me
but
i
seem
to
be
stripping
them
of
externals
all
the
time
what
is
the
good
in
them
what
is
the
truth
in
them
strip
me
if
i
were
not
rich
what
would
anyone
bother
with
me
for
is
anyone
worth
while
underneath
one
or
other
of
the
fluffies
come
almost
daily
to
play
bridge
with
me
and
any
fellow
who
is
on
leave
and
the
neutrals
who
have
no
anxieties
what
a
crew
it
amuses
me
to
strip
them
the
married
one
coralie
has
absolutely
nothing
to
charm
with
if
one
removes
the
ambience
of
success
the
entourage
of
beautiful
things
the
manicurist
and
the
complexion
specialist
the
reboux
hats
and
the
chanel
clothes
she
would
be
a
plain
little
creature
with
not
too
fine
ankles
but
that
which
material
possessions
bring
casts
a
spell
over
coralie
attractive
odette
the
widow
is
beautiful
she
has
the
brain
of
a
turkey
but
she
too
is
exquisitely
dressed
and
surrounded
with
everything
to
enhance
her
loveliness
and
the
serenity
of
success
has
given
her
magnetism
she
announces
platitudes
as
discoveries
she
sparkles
and
is
so
ravishing
that
one
finds
her
trash
wit
she
thinks
she
is
witty
and
you
begin
to
believe
it
odette
can
be
best
stripped
people
could
like
her
just
for
her
looks
alice
the
divorcée
appeals
to
she
is
gentle
and
feminine
and
clinging
she
is
the
cruelest
and
most
merciless
of
the
three
maurice
tells
me
and
the
most
difficult
to
analyse
but
most
of
one
friends
would
find
it
hard
to
stand
the
test
of
denuding
them
of
their
worldly
possessions
and
outside
allurements
it
is
not
only
the
fluffies
who
would
come
out
of
not
much
value
oh
the
long
long
days
and
the
ugly
nights
one
does
not
sleep
very
well
now
the
noise
of
bertha
from
six
and
the
raids
at
night
but
i
believe
i
grow
to
like
the
raids
and
last
night
we
had
a
marvelous
experience
i
had
been
persuaded
by
maurice
to
have
quite
a
large
dinner
party
madame
de
clerté
who
is
really
an
amusing
personality
courageous
and
agreeable
and
daisy
ryven
and
the
fluffies
and
four
or
five
men
we
were
sitting
smoking
afterwards
listening
to
de
volé
playing
he
is
a
great
musician
people
fears
are
lulled
they
have
returned
to
paris
numbers
of
men
are
being
killed
the
english
in
heaps
but
what
will
you
the
fluffies
said
they
had
no
business
to
make
that
break
with
the
fifth
army
oh
no
and
after
all
the
country
is
too
dull
and
we
have
all
our
hidden
store
of
petrol
if
we
must
fly
at
the
last
moment
why
on
earth
not
go
to
the
theatre
and
try
to
pass
the
time
de
volé
was
playing
madame
butterfly
when
the
sirens
went
for
a
raid
and
almost
immediately
the
guns
began
and
bombs
crashed
one
very
seldom
sees
any
fear
on
people
faces
now
they
are
accustomed
to
the
noise
without
asking
any
of
us
de
volé
commenced
chopin
funeral
march
it
was
a
very
wonderful
moment
the
explosions
and
the
guns
mingling
with
the
splendid
chords
we
sat
breathless
a
spell
seemed
to
be
upon
us
all
we
listened
feverishly
de
volé
face
was
transfigured
what
did
he
see
in
the
dim
light
he
played
and
played
and
the
whole
tragedy
of
war
and
the
futility
of
earthly
interests
the
glory
the
splendour
and
the
agony
seemed
to
be
brought
home
to
us
from
this
as
the
noise
without
became
less
loud
he
glided
into
schubert
and
so
at
last
ceased
when
the
all
clear
commenced
to
rend
the
air
no
one
had
spoken
a
word
and
then
daisy
ryven
laughed
a
queer
little
awed
laugh
she
was
the
only
englishwoman
there
we
are
keyed
up
she
said
and
when
they
had
all
gone
i
opened
my
window
wide
and
breathed
in
the
black
dark
night
oh
god
what
a
rotter
i
am
maurice
has
a
new
suggestion
he
says
i
should
write
a
book
he
i
am
becoming
insupportable
and
he
thinks
if
he
flatters
me
enough
i
swallow
the
bait
and
so
be
kept
quiet
and
not
try
him
so
a
novel
a
study
of
the
causes
of
altruism
what
i
feel
yes
i
feel
a
spark
of
interest
if
it
could
take
me
out
of
myself
i
shall
consult
the
duchesse
i
will
tell
burton
to
telephone
and
find
out
if
i
can
see
her
this
afternoon
she
sometimes
takes
half
an
hour
off
between
four
and
five
to
attend
to
her
family
yes
burton
says
she
will
see
me
and
will
send
me
one
of
her
red
cross
cars
to
fetch
me
then
i
can
keep
my
leg
up
i
rather
incline
to
a
treatise
upon
altruism
and
the
philosophical
subjects
i
fear
if
i
wrote
a
novel
it
would
be
saturated
by
my
ugly
spirit
and
i
should
hate
people
to
read
it
i
must
get
that
part
of
me
off
in
my
journal
but
a
book
about
altruism
i
must
have
a
stenographer
of
course
a
typist
if
i
do
begin
this
thing
there
are
some
english
ones
here
no
doubt
i
do
not
wish
to
write
in
french
maurice
must
find
me
a
suitable
i
wo
have
anything
young
and
attractive
in
my
idiotic
state
she
might
get
the
better
of
me
the
idea
of
some
steady
employment
quite
bucks
me
up
i
felt
rather
jarred
when
i
arrived
at
the
hotel
courville
the
paving
across
the
river
is
bad
but
i
found
my
way
to
the
duchesse
own
sitting
room
on
the
first
floor
the
only
room
apparently
left
not
a
ward
and
somehow
the
smell
of
carbolic
had
not
penetrated
here
it
was
too
hot
and
only
a
little
window
was
open
how
wonderfully
beautiful
these
eighteenth
century
rooms
are
what
grace
and
charm
in
the
panelling
what
dignity
in
the
proportions
this
one
like
all
rooms
of
women
of
the
duchesse
age
is
too
full
crammed
almost
with
gems
of
art
and
then
among
them
here
and
there
a
shocking
black
satin
stuffed
and
buttoned
armchair
with
a
bit
of
woolwork
down
its
centre
and
some
fringe
and
her
writing
table
the
famous
one
given
by
louis
xv
to
the
ancestress
who
refused
his
favours
a
mass
of
letters
and
papers
and
reports
a
bottle
of
creosote
and
a
feather
a
servant
in
black
verging
upon
ninety
brought
in
the
tea
and
said
madame
la
duchesse
would
be
there
immediately
and
she
came
her
twinkling
eyes
kindly
as
ever
good
day
nicholas
she
said
and
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
thou
art
thy
mother
child
and
i
thank
thee
for
the
fifty
thousand
francs
for
my
i
say
no
more
her
scissors
got
caught
in
her
pocket
not
the
purple
jersey
this
time
and
she
played
with
them
for
a
minute
thou
art
come
for
something
out
with
it
shall
i
write
a
book
that
it
maurice
thinks
it
might
divert
me
what
do
you
think
one
must
consider
and
she
began
pouring
out
the
tea
paper
is
scarce
i
doubt
my
son
if
what
you
would
inscribe
upon
it
would
justify
the
waste
but
still
as
a
an
asperine
so
to
speak
perhaps
yes
on
what
subject
that
is
what
i
want
your
advice
about
a
novel
or
a
study
upon
altruism
or
or
something
like
that
she
chuckled
and
handed
me
my
tea
thin
tea
and
a
tiny
slice
of
black
bread
and
a
scrape
of
butter
there
is
no
cheating
of
the
regulations
here
but
the
sevres
cup
gave
me
satisfaction
you
have
brought
me
your
bread
coupon
i
hope
she
interrupted
with
if
you
eat
without
it
one
of
my
household
has
less
i
produced
it
two
days
old
will
do
here
then
she
became
all
interest
in
my
project
again
and
chuckled
anew
not
a
novel
my
son
at
your
age
and
with
your
temperament
it
would
arouse
emotions
in
you
if
you
created
them
in
your
characters
you
are
better
without
no
something
serious
altruism
as
well
as
another
by
all
means
i
expected
you
to
say
that
you
are
always
so
practical
and
kind
then
we
will
choose
a
research
subject
to
keep
me
busy
why
not
the
history
of
blankshire
your
old
county
where
the
thormondes
have
sat
since
the
conquest
this
delighted
me
but
i
saw
the
impossibility
i
can
not
get
at
the
necessary
reference
books
and
it
is
impossible
to
receive
anything
from
england
she
realized
this
before
i
spoke
no
philosophy
it
must
be
or
your
pet
hobby
the
furniture
of
your
william
and
mary
this
seemed
the
best
of
all
and
i
decided
in
a
moment
this
shall
be
my
subject
i
really
know
something
of
william
and
mary
furniture
so
we
settled
it
then
she
became
reflective
the
news
is
my
son
she
whispered
softly
the
fearful
ones
predict
that
the
boche
will
be
within
range
in
a
few
why
not
leave
paris
are
you
going
duchesse
i
dieu
of
course
not
i
must
stay
to
get
my
out
if
the
worst
should
come
but
i
never
believe
let
the
cowards
flee
some
of
my
relatives
have
gone
again
those
i
speak
to
will
have
become
a
minority
when
peace
arrives
it
would
seem
then
she
frowned
angrily
many
are
so
splendid
devoted
untiring
but
there
are
some
dieu
the
girls
play
tennis
at
the
aux
and
the
germans
are
kilometers
from
paris
i
did
not
speak
and
then
as
though
i
had
said
something
disparaging
and
she
must
defend
them
but
you
must
not
judge
them
hardly
no
it
is
not
possible
with
our
national
temperament
that
young
girls
of
the
world
can
nurse
men
no
no
and
our
ministry
of
war
wo
employ
women
what
can
they
do
ask
yourself
what
can
they
do
but
wait
and
pray
other
nations
must
not
judge
us
our
men
know
what
they
want
of
us
yes
yes
of
course
they
do
my
niece
madelaine
a
lighthead
dragged
me
to
the
ritz
to
lunch
last
week
before
the
wild
rush
cleared
them
off
again
dieu
what
a
sight
there
in
that
restaurant
olivier
and
the
waiters
are
the
only
things
of
dignity
left
the
women
dressed
to
the
eyes
as
red
cross
nurses
some
americans
and
yes
french
nursing
the
well
english
officers
i
must
believe
no
nearer
wounded
than
that
floating
veils
painted
lips
high
heels
heavens
it
filled
me
with
rage
i
who
know
the
devoted
and
good
of
both
nations
who
are
not
seen
and
you
english
but
there
it
is
easy
for
you
with
your
temperament
to
be
good
and
really
work
france
is
full
of
sensible
kind
americans
and
english
but
those
in
paris
they
make
me
sick
quarter
of
an
hour
twice
a
day
to
have
the
right
to
a
passport
to
come
and
to
wear
a
uniform
pah
sick
sick
i
thought
of
the
fluffies
they
too
played
at
something
the
first
year
of
the
war
but
now
have
given
up
even
the
pretence
of
that
the
duchesse
was
still
angry
my
nephew
charles
le
prince
de
vimont
eats
chicken
and
cutlets
on
the
meatless
days
he
told
me
with
pride
his
he
of
the
one
eye
like
thou
nicholas
is
able
to
procure
plenty
on
the
day
before
from
friends
in
the
trade
and
with
ice
dieu
and
i
pay
francs
apiece
for
the
best
poulets
for
my
for
extra
rations
and
ice
impossible
to
procure
oh
i
would
punish
them
all
choke
them
with
their
own
meat
it
is
they
who
should
be
food
for
the
guns
as
you
english
say
they
these
few
disgrace
our
brave
france
and
make
the
other
nations
laugh
at
us
i
tried
to
assure
her
that
no
one
laughed
and
that
we
all
understood
and
worshipped
the
spirit
of
france
that
it
was
only
the
few
and
that
we
were
not
deceived
but
i
could
not
calm
her
it
makes
me
weep
at
last
she
said
and
i
could
not
comfort
her
heloise
de
tavantaine
my
cousin
jew
paid
four
thousand
francs
for
a
new
evening
dress
which
did
not
cover
a
tenth
of
her
fat
body
four
thousand
francs
would
have
given
my
ah
well
i
rage
i
rage
then
she
checked
herself
but
why
do
i
say
this
to
thee
nicholas
because
i
am
sore
it
is
ever
thus
we
are
all
human
and
must
cry
to
someone
so
after
all
there
is
some
meaning
in
my
journal
must
cry
to
someone
burton
is
delighted
that
i
shall
write
a
book
he
wrote
at
once
to
my
aunt
emmeline
to
tell
her
that
i
was
better
i
have
her
letter
with
congratulations
in
it
burton
does
the
correspondence
with
my
few
relations
all
war
working
hard
in
england
i
am
becoming
quite
excited
i
long
to
begin
but
there
is
no
use
until
maurice
finds
me
a
stenographer
he
has
heard
of
two
one
a
miss
jenkins
aged
forty
sounds
good
but
she
can
only
give
three
hours
a
day
and
i
must
have
one
at
my
beck
and
call
there
is
a
second
one
a
miss
sharp
but
she
is
only
plain
though
maurice
says
and
wears
horn
spectacles
that
should
not
attract
me
she
makes
bandages
all
the
evening
but
is
obliged
to
work
for
her
living
so
could
come
for
the
day
she
is
not
out
of
a
job
because
she
is
very
expert
but
she
does
not
like
her
present
one
i
would
have
to
pay
her
very
highly
maurice
says
i
do
mind
that
i
want
the
i
had
better
see
miss
sharp
and
judge
if
i
can
stand
her
she
may
have
a
personality
i
could
not
work
with
maurice
must
bring
her
the
news
is
the
banks
have
sent
away
all
their
but
i
shall
not
leave
one
might
as
well
die
in
a
bombardment
as
any
other
way
the
english
consul
has
to
know
all
the
names
of
the
english
residents
in
case
of
evacuation
but
i
will
not
go
bertha
is
making
a
most
fiendish
noise
there
were
two
raids
last
night
and
she
began
at
six
this
morning
one
gets
little
sleep
i
have
a
one
horse
victoria
now
driven
by
methusala
i
picked
maurice
up
at
the
ritz
this
evening
at
nine
there
was
not
a
human
soul
to
be
seen
in
the
de
la
or
the
or
the
a
city
of
the
dead
and
the
early
june
sky
full
of
peace
and
soft
light
what
does
it
all
mean
iv
maurice
brought
miss
sharp
to
interview
me
i
do
not
like
her
much
but
the
exhibition
she
gave
me
of
her
speed
and
accuracy
in
satisfied
me
and
made
me
see
that
i
should
be
a
fool
to
look
further
so
i
have
engaged
her
she
is
a
small
creature
palish
with
rather
good
bright
brown
hair
she
wears
horn
rimmed
spectacles
with
yellow
glasses
in
them
so
i
ca
see
her
eyes
at
all
i
judge
people
by
their
eyes
her
hands
look
as
if
she
had
done
rather
a
lot
of
hard
work
they
are
so
very
thin
her
clothes
are
neat
but
shabby
that
is
not
the
last
look
like
french
women
have
but
as
if
they
had
been
turned
to
make
do
i
suppose
she
is
very
poor
her
manner
is
icily
quiet
she
only
speaks
when
she
is
spoken
to
she
is
quite
uninteresting
it
is
better
for
me
to
have
a
nonentity
then
i
can
talk
aloud
my
thoughts
without
restriction
i
am
to
give
her
double
what
she
is
getting
now
francs
a
month
war
price
some
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
when
i
offered
that
and
she
hesitated
i
said
do
you
think
it
is
enough
she
answered
so
queerly
i
think
it
is
too
much
and
i
was
wondering
if
i
would
be
able
to
accept
it
i
want
to
then
do
very
well
i
will
of
course
do
my
very
best
to
earn
it
and
with
that
she
bowed
and
left
me
anyhow
she
wo
make
a
noise
nina
writes
since
she
has
married
jim
which
she
did
just
before
the
offensive
in
march
she
has
been
too
happy
or
too
anxious
to
remember
her
friends
even
dear
old
ones
but
now
fortunately
jim
is
wounded
in
the
ankle
bone
which
will
keep
him
at
home
for
two
months
so
she
has
a
little
leisure
you
ca
think
nicholas
what
a
different
aspect
the
whole
war
took
on
when
i
knew
jim
was
in
the
front
line
i
adore
him
and
up
to
now
i
have
managed
to
keep
him
adoring
me
but
i
can
see
i
have
to
be
careful
if
he
is
going
to
be
with
me
long
at
a
time
so
it
would
seem
that
nina
had
not
obtained
the
rest
and
security
she
hoped
for
i
hope
my
writing
a
book
will
rest
me
i
have
arranged
all
my
first
chapter
in
my
head
and
i
begin
miss
sharp
came
punctually
at
ten
she
had
a
black
and
white
cotton
frock
on
there
is
nothing
of
her
she
is
so
slight
a
mass
of
bones
probably
in
evening
dress
but
thank
goodness
i
shall
not
see
her
in
evening
dress
she
goes
at
six
she
is
to
have
her
lunch
here
burton
has
arranged
it
an
hour
off
for
lunch
which
she
can
have
on
a
tray
in
the
small
salon
which
i
have
had
arranged
for
her
work
of
course
it
wo
take
her
an
hour
to
eat
but
burton
says
she
must
have
that
time
it
is
always
done
it
is
a
great
nuisance
for
perhaps
when
comes
i
shall
just
be
in
the
middle
of
an
inspiration
and
i
suppose
off
she
fly
like
the
housemaids
used
when
the
hall
bell
went
at
home
but
i
ca
say
anything
i
was
full
of
ideas
and
the
beginning
of
my
first
chapter
spouted
out
and
when
miss
sharp
had
read
it
over
to
me
i
found
she
had
not
made
any
mistake
that
is
a
mercy
she
went
away
and
typed
it
and
then
had
her
lunch
and
i
had
mine
but
maurice
dropped
in
and
mine
took
longer
than
hers
it
was
half
past
two
when
i
rang
my
hand
bell
for
her
it
is
a
jolly
little
silver
one
i
bought
once
in
cairo
she
answered
it
promptly
the
script
in
her
hand
i
have
had
half
an
hour
with
nothing
to
do
she
said
can
you
not
give
me
some
other
work
which
i
can
turn
to
if
this
should
happen
again
you
can
read
a
book
there
are
lots
in
the
book
case
i
told
her
or
i
might
leave
you
some
letters
to
answer
thank
you
that
would
be
best
she
is
conscientious
evidently
we
began
again
she
sits
at
a
table
with
her
notebook
and
while
i
pause
she
is
absolutely
still
that
is
good
i
feel
she
wo
count
more
than
a
table
or
chair
i
am
quite
pleased
with
my
work
it
is
awfully
hot
and
there
is
some
tension
in
the
air
as
though
something
was
going
to
happen
the
news
is
the
same
perhaps
slightly
i
am
going
to
have
a
small
dinner
the
widow
and
maurice
and
madame
de
clerté
just
four
and
we
are
going
to
the
play
it
is
such
a
business
for
me
to
go
i
seldom
turn
maurice
is
having
a
little
supper
in
his
rooms
at
the
ritz
for
us
it
is
my
birthday
i
am
years
old
what
an
evening
that
of
june
the
theatre
was
hot
and
the
cramped
position
worried
me
so
and
the
lights
made
my
eye
ache
madame
de
clerté
and
i
left
before
the
end
and
ambled
back
to
the
ritz
in
my
one
horse
victoria
and
went
and
sat
in
maurice
room
we
talked
of
the
situation
and
the
effect
of
the
americans
coming
in
bucking
everyone
up
we
were
rather
cheerful
then
the
sirens
began
and
the
guns
followed
just
as
maurice
and
odette
got
back
they
seemed
unusually
loud
and
we
could
hear
the
bits
of
shrapnel
falling
on
the
terrace
beneath
us
odette
was
frightened
and
suggested
going
into
the
cellar
but
as
maurice
rooms
are
only
on
the
second
floor
we
did
not
want
to
take
the
trouble
fear
has
a
peculiar
effect
upon
some
people
odette
complexion
turned
grey
and
she
could
hardly
keep
her
voice
steady
i
wondered
how
soon
she
would
let
restraint
slip
from
her
and
fly
out
of
the
room
to
the
cellar
madame
de
clerté
was
quite
unmoved
then
the
dramatic
happened
bang
the
whole
house
shook
and
the
glass
of
the
window
crashed
in
fragments
and
maurice
turned
out
the
one
light
and
lifted
a
corner
of
the
thick
curtain
to
peep
out
i
believe
they
got
the
he
said
awed
and
as
he
spoke
another
bomb
fell
on
the
ministaìre
beside
us
and
some
of
the
splinters
shot
into
space
and
buried
themselves
in
our
wall
we
were
all
blown
across
the
room
and
madame
de
clerté
and
i
fell
in
a
heap
together
by
the
door
which
gave
way
outwards
odette
shrieks
made
us
think
that
she
was
hurt
but
she
was
not
and
subsided
into
a
gibbering
prayer
maurice
helped
madame
de
clerté
to
rise
and
i
turned
on
the
torch
i
keep
in
my
pocket
for
a
minute
i
was
not
conscious
of
any
pain
we
sat
in
the
dark
and
listened
to
the
commotion
beneath
us
for
some
time
and
the
crashing
bombs
but
never
one
so
near
maurice
voice
soothing
odette
was
the
only
sound
in
our
room
then
madame
de
clerté
laughed
softly
and
lit
a
cigarette
a
near
thing
that
nicholas
she
said
let
us
go
down
now
and
see
who
is
killed
and
where
the
explosion
actually
occurred
the
sight
is
quite
interesting
you
know
you
can
believe
me
when
bertha
hit
the
two
days
ago
we
rushed
for
taxis
to
go
down
to
see
the
place
coralie
has
petrol
for
her
motor
since
two
weeks
you
know
and
she
smiled
wickedly
monsieur
le
ministre
must
show
his
gratitude
somehow
must
he
coralie
is
such
a
dear
yes
so
some
of
us
packed
in
with
her
we
were
quite
a
large
party
and
when
we
got
there
they
were
trying
to
extinguish
the
fire
and
bringing
out
the
bodies
you
ought
to
come
with
us
sometime
when
we
go
on
these
trips
anything
for
a
change
these
women
would
not
have
looked
on
at
the
sufferings
of
a
mouse
before
the
war
the
sight
in
the
hall
when
we
did
arrive
there
after
the
all
clear
went
was
remarkable
the
great
glass
doors
of
the
salon
blown
in
and
all
the
windows
broken
and
the
a
mass
of
debris
not
a
pane
whole
there
i
should
think
but
nobody
seems
very
much
upset
these
things
are
all
in
the
days
work
i
wonder
if
in
years
to
come
we
shall
remember
the
queer
recklessness
which
has
developed
in
almost
everyones
mentality
or
shall
we
forget
about
the
war
and
go
on
just
as
we
were
before
who
knows
i
said
to
miss
sharp
this
morning
what
do
you
do
in
the
evenings
when
you
leave
here
i
had
forgotten
for
a
moment
that
maurice
had
told
me
that
she
makes
bandages
she
looked
at
me
and
her
manner
froze
i
ca
think
why
i
she
thought
i
had
no
right
to
question
her
i
say
looked
at
me
but
i
am
never
quite
sure
what
her
eyes
are
doing
because
she
never
takes
off
her
yellow
glasses
those
appear
to
be
gazing
at
me
at
all
events
i
make
bandages
are
you
dead
tired
after
working
all
day
with
me
i
have
not
thought
about
it
the
bandages
are
badly
needed
her
pencil
was
in
her
hand
and
the
block
ready
she
evidently
did
not
mean
to
go
on
conversing
with
me
this
attitude
of
continuous
diligence
on
her
part
has
begun
to
irritate
me
she
never
fidgets
just
works
all
the
time
i
ask
burton
what
he
thinks
of
her
at
luncheon
as
i
said
before
burton
knows
the
world
what
do
you
think
of
my
typist
burton
he
was
putting
a
dish
of
before
me
it
is
a
meatless
day
my
cook
is
an
artist
but
he
thinks
me
a
fool
because
i
wo
let
him
cheat
our
want
of
legs
makes
us
friendly
though
and
with
a
brother
in
the
trade
i
could
get
monsieur
chickens
and
what
he
would
wish
he
expostulates
each
week
burton
croaked
i
repeated
the
question
the
young
lady
works
very
regular
yes
that
is
just
it
a
kind
of
a
machine
she
earns
her
money
sir
nicholas
of
course
she
does
i
know
all
that
but
what
do
you
think
of
her
beg
pardon
sir
nicholas
i
do
understand
i
felt
irritated
of
course
you
do
what
kind
of
a
creature
i
mean
the
young
lady
do
chatter
sir
she
do
behave
like
bits
of
girls
you
approve
of
her
then
burton
she
been
here
a
fortnight
only
sir
nicholas
you
ca
tell
in
the
time
and
that
is
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
but
i
felt
the
verdict
when
he
did
give
it
would
be
favourable
insignificant
little
miss
sharp
what
shall
i
do
with
my
day
that
is
the
question
my
rotten
useless
idle
day
i
have
no
more
inspiration
for
my
book
besides
miss
sharp
has
to
type
the
long
chapter
i
gave
her
yesterday
i
wonder
if
she
knows
anything
about
william
and
mary
furniture
really
she
never
launches
a
remark
her
hands
are
very
red
these
last
days
does
making
bandages
redden
the
hands
i
wonder
what
colour
her
eyes
are
one
ca
tell
with
that
blurred
yellow
glass
suzette
came
in
just
as
i
wrote
that
she
seldom
turns
up
in
the
afternoon
she
caught
sight
of
miss
sharp
typing
through
the
open
door
she
spit
at
me
since
when
i
am
writing
a
book
suzette
i
must
see
her
face
and
without
waiting
for
permission
suzette
flounced
into
the
small
salon
i
could
hear
her
shrill
little
voice
asking
miss
sharp
to
be
so
good
as
to
give
her
an
envelope
she
must
write
an
address
i
watched
her
miss
sharp
handed
her
one
and
went
on
with
her
work
suzette
returned
closing
the
door
without
temper
behind
her
wouff
she
announced
to
me
no
anxiety
there
an
not
appetizing
not
a
like
us
as
thin
as
a
hairpin
nothing
for
thou
nicholas
and
dieu
she
does
the
family
washing
by
her
hands
i
know
mine
look
like
that
when
i
have
taken
one
of
my
fortnights
at
the
sea
you
think
it
is
washing
i
was
wondering
does
she
take
off
her
glasses
ever
nicholas
no
perhaps
she
has
weak
light
eyes
one
never
can
tell
suzette
was
not
yet
quite
at
ease
about
it
all
i
was
almost
driven
to
ask
miss
sharp
to
remove
her
glasses
to
reassure
her
women
are
jealous
even
of
half
blind
men
i
would
like
to
ask
my
cook
if
he
has
the
same
trouble
but
oh
i
wish
anything
mattered
suzette
showed
affection
for
me
after
this
and
even
passion
i
would
be
quite
she
said
when
i
should
be
finished
glass
eyes
were
so
well
made
now
and
as
for
legs
truly
my
little
cabbage
they
are
as
nimble
as
a
goat
of
course
i
felt
comforted
when
she
had
gone
the
hot
days
pass
miss
sharp
has
not
asked
for
a
holiday
she
plods
along
we
do
a
great
deal
of
work
and
she
writes
all
my
letters
and
there
are
days
when
i
know
i
am
going
to
be
busy
with
my
friends
when
i
tell
her
she
need
not
come
there
was
a
whole
week
at
the
end
of
july
her
manner
never
alters
but
when
burton
attempted
to
pay
her
she
refused
to
take
the
cheque
i
did
not
earn
that
she
said
i
was
angry
with
burton
because
he
did
not
insist
it
was
just
sir
nicholas
no
it
was
not
burton
if
she
did
not
work
here
she
was
out
of
pocket
not
working
anywhere
else
you
will
please
add
the
wretched
sum
to
this
week
salary
burton
nodded
stubbornly
so
i
spoke
to
miss
sharp
myself
it
was
my
business
as
to
whether
i
worked
or
did
not
work
for
a
week
therefore
you
are
owed
payment
in
any
case
that
is
logic
a
queer
red
came
into
her
transparent
skin
her
mouth
shut
firmly
i
knew
that
i
had
convinced
her
and
that
yet
for
some
reason
she
hated
having
to
take
the
money
she
did
not
even
answer
just
bowed
with
that
strange
aloofness
that
is
not
insolent
her
manner
is
never
like
a
person
of
the
lower
classes
trying
to
show
she
thinks
she
is
an
equal
it
has
exactly
the
right
note
perfectly
respectful
as
one
who
is
employed
but
with
the
serene
unselfconsciousness
that
only
breeding
gives
shades
of
manner
are
very
interesting
to
watch
somehow
i
that
miss
sharp
in
her
washed
cotton
with
her
red
little
hands
is
a
lady
i
have
not
seen
my
dear
duchesse
lately
she
has
been
down
to
one
of
her
country
places
where
she
sends
her
convalescents
but
she
is
returning
soon
she
gives
me
pleasure
the
interest
in
the
book
has
flagged
lately
i
could
not
think
of
a
thing
so
i
proposed
to
miss
sharp
to
have
a
holiday
she
accepted
the
fortnight
without
enthusiasm
now
she
is
back
and
we
have
begun
again
still
i
have
no
why
do
i
stick
to
it
just
because
i
have
said
to
the
duchesse
that
i
finish
it
i
have
an
uneasy
feeling
that
i
do
not
want
to
probe
my
real
reason
i
would
like
to
lie
even
to
this
journal
lots
of
fellows
have
been
upon
the
five
days
leave
lately
things
are
going
better
they
jolly
one
and
i
like
to
see
them
but
after
they
go
i
feel
more
of
a
rotten
beast
than
ever
the
only
times
i
forget
are
when
maurice
brings
the
fluffies
to
dine
with
me
when
they
rush
up
to
paris
from
deauville
we
drink
champagne
they
love
to
know
how
much
it
costs
and
i
feel
gay
as
a
boy
and
then
in
the
night
i
have
once
or
twice
reached
out
for
my
revolver
they
have
all
gone
back
to
deauville
now
perhaps
it
is
miss
sharp
who
irritates
me
with
her
eternal
diligence
what
is
her
life
who
are
her
family
i
would
like
to
know
but
i
will
not
ask
i
sit
and
think
and
think
what
to
write
about
in
my
book
i
have
almost
come
to
the
end
of
grinding
out
facts
about
walnut
and
ball
fringe
and
she
sits
taking
it
all
down
in
never
raising
her
head
day
after
day
her
hair
is
pretty
that
silky
sort
of
nut
brown
with
an
incipient
wave
in
it
her
head
is
set
on
most
gracefully
i
must
admit
and
the
complexion
is
very
pale
and
transparent
but
what
a
firm
mouth
not
cold
though
only
firm
i
have
never
seen
her
smile
the
hands
are
well
shaped
really
awfully
well
shaped
if
one
watches
them
how
long
would
it
take
to
get
them
white
again
i
wonder
she
has
got
good
feet
too
thin
like
the
hands
how
worn
her
clothes
look
does
she
never
have
a
new
dress
yes
burton
i
will
see
madame
de
clerté
solonge
de
clerté
is
a
philosopher
she
has
her
own
aims
but
i
do
not
know
them
writing
a
book
nicholas
there
was
the
devil
of
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
there
is
a
poor
boy
wounded
in
the
leg
who
would
make
a
perfect
secretary
if
you
are
not
satisfied
i
grew
irritated
i
am
quite
satisfied
we
heard
the
noise
of
the
typing
machine
from
beyond
these
modern
doors
allow
nothing
to
be
unknown
young
is
she
madame
de
clerté
asked
turning
her
glance
in
that
direction
i
do
know
and
do
care
she
types
well
she
saw
that
i
was
becoming
my
dinners
are
good
and
the
war
is
not
yet
over
we
shall
all
be
terribly
interested
yes
when
we
read
the
result
probably
then
she
told
me
of
complications
occurring
about
coralie
husband
of
an
insanity
to
attempt
the
three
at
once
she
sighed
and
now
i
can
turn
to
my
journal
again
good
god
the
last
pages
have
all
been
about
miss
sharp
ridiculous
exasperating
miss
sharp
did
i
write
ridiculous
no
it
is
i
who
am
ridiculous
i
shall
go
for
a
drive
god
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
i
have
been
in
hell
i
came
in
from
my
drive
very
quietly
it
was
early
a
quarter
to
six
miss
sharp
goes
at
six
it
was
a
horribly
chilly
evening
and
burton
had
lit
a
bright
wood
fire
and
i
suppose
its
crackling
prevented
my
hearing
the
sounds
which
were
coming
from
the
next
room
for
a
minute
i
sat
down
in
my
chair
what
was
that
the
of
a
dove
no
a
woman
voice
cooing
foolish
love
words
in
french
and
english
and
a
child
treble
gurgling
fondness
back
to
her
it
seemed
as
if
my
heart
stopped
beating
as
if
every
nerve
in
my
spine
quivered
a
tremendous
emotion
of
i
know
not
what
convulsed
i
lay
and
listened
and
suddenly
i
felt
my
cheek
wet
with
tears
then
some
shame
some
anger
shook
me
and
i
started
to
my
feet
and
hobbled
to
the
door
which
was
ajar
i
opened
it
wide
there
was
miss
sharp
with
the
daughter
baby
on
her
lap
fondling
it
the
creature
may
be
six
months
old
her
horn
spectacles
lay
on
the
table
she
looked
up
at
me
the
slightest
flash
of
timidity
showing
but
her
eyes
oh
god
the
eyes
of
the
madonna
heavenly
blue
tender
as
an
angel
soft
as
a
doe
i
could
have
cried
aloud
with
some
pain
in
the
soul
and
so
that
brute
part
of
me
spoke
how
dare
you
make
this
noise
i
said
rudely
do
you
not
know
that
i
have
given
orders
for
complete
quiet
she
rose
holding
the
child
with
the
greatest
dignity
the
picture
she
made
could
be
in
the
sistine
chapel
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
in
a
voice
which
was
not
quite
steady
i
did
not
know
you
had
returned
and
madame
bizot
asked
me
to
hold
little
augustine
while
she
went
to
the
next
floor
it
shall
not
occur
again
i
longed
to
stay
and
gaze
at
them
both
i
would
have
liked
to
have
touched
the
baby
queer
little
fat
fingers
i
would
have
liked
oh
i
know
not
what
and
all
the
time
miss
sharp
held
the
child
protectively
as
though
something
evil
would
come
from
me
and
harm
then
she
turned
and
carried
it
out
of
the
room
and
i
went
back
into
my
and
flung
myself
down
in
my
chair
what
had
i
done
beast
brute
what
had
i
done
and
will
she
never
come
back
again
and
will
life
be
emptier
than
ever
i
could
kill
myself
it
shall
not
be
only
suzette
but
six
others
for
supper
the
dawn
is
here
and
it
is
not
the
rare
sound
of
an
august
pigeon
that
i
am
listening
to
but
the
tender
cooing
of
a
woman
and
a
child
god
how
can
i
get
it
out
of
my
ears
v
this
morning
i
feel
as
if
i
could
hardly
bear
it
until
miss
sharp
arrives
i
dressed
early
ready
to
begin
a
new
chapter
although
i
have
not
an
idea
in
my
head
and
as
the
time
grows
nearer
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
remain
still
here
in
my
chair
have
i
been
too
impossible
will
she
not
turn
up
and
if
she
does
not
what
steps
can
i
take
to
find
her
maurice
is
at
deauville
with
the
rest
and
i
do
not
know
miss
sharp
home
address
nor
if
she
has
a
telephone
probably
not
my
heart
beats
i
have
every
feeling
of
excitement
as
stupid
as
a
woman
i
analyse
it
all
now
how
mental
emotion
reacts
on
the
physical
even
the
empty
socket
of
my
eye
aches
i
could
hardly
control
my
voice
when
burton
began
a
conversation
about
my
orders
for
the
day
just
now
you
would
not
be
wishin
for
the
company
of
your
aunt
emmeline
sir
nicholas
he
asked
me
of
course
not
burton
you
old
fool
you
seem
so
much
more
restless
sir
lately
i
am
restless
please
leave
me
alone
he
coughed
and
retired
now
i
am
listening
again
it
wants
two
minutes
to
the
hour
she
is
never
late
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
it
feels
as
if
the
blood
would
burst
the
veins
i
can
not
write
she
came
after
all
only
ten
minutes
beyond
her
usual
time
but
they
seemed
an
eternity
when
i
heard
the
ring
and
burton
slow
step
i
could
have
bounded
from
my
chair
to
open
the
door
it
was
a
telegram
how
this
always
happens
when
one
is
expecting
anyone
with
desperate
anxiety
a
telegram
from
suzette
i
shall
return
her
cabbage
i
never
want
to
see
her
again
miss
sharp
must
have
entered
when
the
door
was
opened
for
the
telegram
for
i
had
begun
to
feel
pretty
low
again
when
i
heard
her
knock
at
the
door
of
the
she
came
in
and
up
to
my
chair
as
usual
but
she
did
not
say
her
accustomary
cold
good
morning
i
looked
up
the
horn
spectacles
were
over
her
eyes
again
and
the
rest
of
her
face
was
very
pale
while
there
was
something
haughty
in
the
carriage
of
her
small
head
it
seemed
to
me
her
eternal
pad
and
pencil
were
in
her
little
thin
red
hands
good
morning
i
said
tentatively
she
made
a
slight
inclination
as
much
as
to
say
i
recognize
you
have
spoken
then
she
waited
for
me
to
continue
i
felt
an
egregious
ass
i
knew
i
was
nervous
as
a
bird
i
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
i
nicholas
thormonde
accustomed
to
any
old
thing
nervous
of
a
little
secretary
er
would
you
read
me
aloud
the
last
chapter
we
finished
i
barked
at
last
lamely
she
turned
to
fetch
the
script
from
the
other
room
i
must
apologize
to
her
i
knew
she
came
back
and
sat
down
stiffly
prepared
to
begin
i
am
sorry
i
was
such
an
uncouth
brute
yesterday
i
said
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
back
will
you
forgive
me
she
bowed
again
i
almost
hated
her
at
that
moment
she
was
making
me
feel
so
much
a
foolish
arrogance
rose
in
me
we
had
better
get
to
work
i
suppose
i
went
on
pettishly
she
began
to
read
how
soft
her
voice
is
and
how
perfectly
her
family
must
be
very
refined
gentlefolk
ordinary
english
typists
have
not
that
indescribable
distinction
of
tone
what
voices
mean
to
one
the
delight
of
that
exquisite
sound
of
refinement
in
the
pronunciation
miss
sharp
never
misplaces
an
inflection
or
slurs
a
word
she
never
uses
slang
and
yet
there
is
nothing
pedantic
in
her
selection
of
language
it
is
just
as
if
her
habitual
associates
were
all
of
the
same
class
as
herself
and
that
she
never
heard
coarse
who
can
she
be
the
music
of
her
reading
calmed
me
how
i
wish
we
could
be
friends
how
old
is
madame
bizot
grandchild
i
asked
abruptly
interrupting
six
months
answered
miss
sharp
without
looking
up
you
like
children
yes
perhaps
you
have
brothers
and
sisters
yes
i
knew
that
i
was
looking
at
her
hungrily
and
that
she
was
purposely
keeping
her
lids
lowered
how
many
two
the
tone
said
i
consider
your
questions
impertinent
i
went
on
brothers
one
brother
and
a
sister
yes
how
old
eleven
and
thirteen
that
is
quite
a
gap
between
your
ages
then
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
reply
to
this
there
was
the
faintest
impatience
in
the
way
she
moved
the
manuscript
i
was
so
afraid
to
annoy
her
further
in
case
she
should
give
me
notice
to
go
that
i
let
her
have
her
way
and
returned
to
work
but
i
was
conscious
of
her
presence
thrillingly
conscious
of
her
presence
all
the
morning
i
never
once
was
able
to
take
the
work
naturally
it
was
will
alone
which
made
me
grind
out
the
words
there
was
no
sign
of
nervousness
in
miss
sharp
manner
i
simply
did
not
exist
for
her
i
was
a
bore
a
selfish
useless
bore
of
an
employer
who
was
paying
her
twice
as
much
as
anyone
else
would
and
she
must
in
return
give
the
most
perfect
service
as
a
man
i
had
no
meaning
as
a
wounded
human
being
she
had
no
pity
for
me
but
i
did
not
want
her
pity
what
did
i
want
i
can
not
write
it
i
can
not
face
it
am
i
to
have
a
new
torment
in
my
life
desiring
the
unattainable
eating
my
heart
out
not
that
woman
can
never
really
love
me
again
but
that
well
or
ill
the
consideration
of
woman
is
beyond
my
reach
miss
sharp
is
not
influenced
because
i
am
or
am
not
a
cripple
if
i
were
as
i
was
when
i
first
put
on
my
grenadier
uniform
i
should
still
not
exist
for
her
probably
she
can
see
the
worthless
creature
that
i
am
need
i
always
be
so
i
wish
to
god
i
knew
she
worked
with
her
usual
diligence
the
entire
day
almost
not
taking
the
least
notice
of
me
until
at
five
when
my
tea
came
i
rang
for
her
perhaps
it
was
the
irritation
reacting
upon
my
sensitive
wrenched
nerves
but
i
felt
pretty
rotten
my
hands
were
damp
another
beastly
unattractive
thing
which
as
a
rule
does
not
happen
to
me
i
asked
her
to
pour
out
the
tea
if
you
will
be
so
kind
i
said
i
have
let
burton
go
out
mercifully
this
was
true
she
came
in
as
a
person
would
who
knew
you
had
a
right
to
command
you
could
not
have
said
if
she
minded
or
no
when
she
was
near
me
i
felt
happier
for
some
reason
she
asked
me
how
i
took
my
tea
and
i
told
her
are
you
not
going
to
have
some
with
me
i
pleaded
mine
is
already
on
my
table
in
the
next
room
thank
you
and
she
rose
in
desperation
i
blurted
out
please
do
not
go
i
do
know
why
but
i
feel
most
awfully
rotten
she
sat
down
again
and
poured
out
her
cup
if
you
are
suffering
shall
i
read
to
you
she
said
it
might
send
you
to
sleep
and
somehow
i
fancied
that
while
her
firm
mouth
never
softened
perhaps
the
eyes
behind
the
horn
spectacles
might
not
be
so
stony
and
yet
with
it
all
something
in
me
resented
her
pity
if
she
felt
any
physical
suffering
produces
some
weaknesses
which
respond
to
sympathy
and
the
spirit
rages
at
the
knowledge
that
one
has
given
way
i
never
felt
so
mad
in
all
my
year
of
hell
that
i
can
not
be
a
man
and
fight
as
i
did
at
that
moment
a
french
friend
of
mine
said
in
english
books
people
were
always
having
tea
handing
cups
of
tea
tea
tea
every
chapter
and
every
scene
tea
there
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
it
tea
seems
to
bring
the
characters
together
at
tea
time
people
talk
it
is
the
excuse
to
call
at
that
hour
of
leisure
we
are
too
active
as
a
nation
to
meet
at
any
other
time
in
the
day
except
for
sport
so
tea
is
our
link
and
we
shall
go
down
through
the
ages
as
tea
fiends
because
our
novelists
who
portray
life
accurately
chronicle
that
most
of
the
thrilling
scenes
of
our
lives
pass
among
tea
cups
i
ventured
to
say
all
this
to
miss
sharp
by
way
of
drawing
her
into
conversation
what
could
one
describe
as
the
french
doing
most
often
i
asked
her
she
thought
a
moment
they
do
not
make
excuses
for
anything
they
do
they
have
not
to
have
a
pretext
for
action
as
we
have
they
are
much
less
hypocritical
and
i
wanted
to
make
her
talk
why
are
we
such
hypocrites
because
we
have
set
up
an
impossible
standard
for
ourselves
and
hate
to
show
each
other
that
we
can
not
act
up
to
it
yes
we
conceal
every
feeling
we
show
indifference
when
we
feel
interest
we
pretend
we
have
come
on
business
when
we
have
come
simply
to
see
someone
we
are
attracted
by
she
let
the
conversation
drop
this
provoked
me
as
her
last
remark
showed
how
far
from
stupid
she
is
that
nervous
feeling
overcame
me
again
confound
the
woman
please
read
i
said
at
last
in
desperation
and
i
closed
my
one
eye
she
picked
up
a
book
it
happened
to
be
a
volume
of
de
musset
and
she
read
at
random
her
french
is
as
perfect
as
her
english
the
last
thing
i
remember
was
and
when
i
awoke
it
was
past
six
and
she
had
gone
home
i
wonder
how
many
of
us
since
the
war
know
the
desolation
of
waking
alone
and
in
pain
and
helpless
of
course
there
must
be
hundreds
if
i
am
a
rotter
and
a
coward
about
suffering
at
all
events
it
does
not
come
out
in
words
and
perhaps
it
is
because
i
am
such
a
mixture
that
i
am
able
to
write
it
in
this
journal
if
i
were
purely
english
i
should
not
be
able
to
let
myself
go
even
here
suzette
came
to
dinner
i
thought
how
vulgar
she
looked
and
that
if
her
hands
were
white
they
were
podgy
and
the
nails
short
the
three
black
hairs
irritated
my
cheek
when
she
kissed
me
i
was
brutal
and
moved
my
head
in
irritation
mon
ami
she
said
and
pouted
amuse
me
i
commanded
so
it
is
not
love
then
nicholas
thou
desirest
bear
not
in
the
least
i
shall
never
want
love
again
probably
divert
me
tell
me
tell
me
of
your
scheming
little
mouse
brain
and
your
kind
little
heart
how
is
it
le
suzette
settled
herself
on
the
sofa
curled
up
among
the
pillows
like
a
plump
little
tabby
cat
she
lit
a
cigarette
very
middling
she
whiffed
cases
of
love
where
all
my
good
counsel
remains
untaken
a
madness
for
drugs
very
foolish
a
drug
yes
to
try
but
to
continue
dieu
they
will
no
longer
make
fortunes
le
when
you
have
made
your
fortune
suzette
what
will
you
do
with
it
i
shall
buy
that
farm
for
my
mother
i
shall
put
georgine
into
a
convent
for
the
nobility
and
arrange
a
large
dot
for
her
and
for
me
i
shall
gamble
in
a
controlled
way
at
monte
carlo
you
wo
marry
then
suzette
marry
she
laughed
a
shrill
laugh
for
why
nicholas
a
to
one
man
to
what
good
and
yet
who
can
say
to
be
an
honored
wife
is
the
one
experience
i
do
not
know
yet
she
laughed
again
and
who
is
georgine
you
have
not
spoken
of
her
before
suzette
she
reddened
a
little
under
her
new
terra
cotta
rouge
no
oh
georgine
is
my
little
first
mistake
but
i
have
her
beautifully
brought
up
nicholas
with
the
holy
mother
at
brieux
i
am
then
her
aunt
so
to
speak
the
wife
of
a
small
shop
keeper
in
paris
you
must
know
she
adores
me
and
i
give
all
i
can
to
georgine
will
be
a
lady
and
marry
the
son
one
day
something
touched
me
infinitely
this
queer
little
mother
her
thoughts
set
on
her
child
purity
and
the
conventional
marriage
for
her
in
the
future
her
plebeian
insolent
little
round
face
so
kindly
in
repose
i
respect
suzette
far
more
than
my
friends
of
the
world
when
she
left
it
was
perhaps
in
bad
taste
but
i
gave
her
a
quite
heavy
four
figure
cheque
for
the
education
of
georgine
suzette
she
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
kissed
me
frankly
on
both
cheeks
and
tears
were
brimming
over
in
her
merry
black
eyes
thou
hast
after
all
a
heart
and
art
after
all
a
gentleman
nicholas
and
she
ran
from
the
room
vi
for
two
days
after
i
last
wrote
i
tried
not
to
see
miss
sharp
i
gave
short
moments
to
my
book
and
she
answered
a
number
of
business
letters
she
knows
most
of
my
affairs
now
burton
transmits
all
the
bills
and
papers
to
i
can
hear
them
talking
through
the
thin
door
the
excitement
of
that
time
i
was
so
rude
seems
to
have
used
up
my
vitality
an
utter
weariness
is
upon
me
i
have
hardly
stirred
from
my
chair
the
ancient
guardsman
george
harcourt
came
to
lunch
yesterday
he
was
as
cynically
whimsical
as
ever
he
has
a
new
love
an
italian
and
until
now
she
has
refused
all
his
offers
of
presents
so
he
is
taking
a
tremendous
interest
in
her
in
what
an
incredible
way
the
minds
of
women
work
nicholas
he
said
they
have
frequently
a
very
definite
aim
underneath
but
they
i
looked
puzzled
i
suppose
to
is
a
new
verb
he
announced
daisy
ryven
coined
it
means
just
as
you
alight
upon
a
subject
and
begin
tackling
it
you
spring
to
another
one
these
lovely
american
war
workers
it
is
impossible
to
keep
pace
with
them
i
laughed
yet
they
seem
to
have
quite
a
definite
aim
to
get
pleasure
out
of
life

you
can
have
no
continued
sensible
conversation
with
any
of
these
women
they
force
you
to
enjoy
only
their
skins
can

has

languour
of
the

she
does
not

is
frankly
only
interested
in

honestly
george
do
you
believe
there
is
such
a
thing
as
real
love
we
have
discussed
this
before
nicholas
you
know
my
views
but
i
am
hoping
violetta
will
change
them
she
has
just
begun
to
ask
daily
if
i
love
her
why
do
women
always
do
that
even
one
little
friends
continually
murmur
the
question
it
is
the
working
of
their
subconscious
minds
damn
good
cigars
these
my
dear
boy
eh
yes
it
is
to
justify
their
surrender
they
want
to
be
assured
that
you
adore
them
because
you
see
the
actions
of
love
really
prove
nothing
of
love
itself
a
stranger
who
has
happened
to
appeal
to
the
senses
can
call
them
forth
quite
as
successfully
as
the
lady
of
one
heart
it
is
logical
of
women
then
to
ask
that
eternal
question
quite
i
make
a
point
of
answering
them
always
without
irritation
i
wonder
if
miss
sharp
loved
anyone
would
she
but
i
am
determined
not
to
speculate
further
about
her
when
colonel
harcourt
had
gone
i
deliberately
rang
my
bell
and
when
she
came
into
the
room
i
found
i
was
not
sure
what
i
had
rung
for
it
is
the
most
exasperating
fact
that
miss
sharp
keeps
me
in
a
continual
state
of
nervous
consciousness
her
manner
was
indifferently
expectant
if
one
can
use
such
a
paradoxical
description
i
i
wondered
if
you
played
the
piano
i
blurted
out
she
looked
surprised
if
one
can
ever
say
she
looks
anything
with
the
expression
of
her
eyes
completely
hidden
she
answered
as
usual
with
one
word
yes
i
suppose
you
would
not
play
to
me
er
it
might
give
me
an
inspiration
for
the
last
chapter
she
went
and
opened
the
lid
of
the
instrument
what
sort
of
music
do
you
like
she
asked
play
whatever
you
think
i
would
appreciate
she
began
a
fox
trot
she
played
it
with
unaccountable
spirit
and
taste
so
that
the
sound
did
not
jar
me
but
the
inference
hurt
a
little
i
said
nothing
however
then
she
played
smiles
and
the
sweet
commonplace
air
said
all
sorts
of
things
to
me
desire
to
live
again
and
dance
and
enjoy
foolish
pleasures
how
could
this
little
iceberg
of
a
girl
put
so
much
devilment
into
the
way
she
touched
the
keys
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
interest
this
problem
caused
me
the
longing
the
sounds
aroused
in
me
to
be
human
again
would
have
driven
me
mad
no
one
who
can
play
dance
music
with
that
lilt
can
be
as
cold
as
a
stone
from
this
she
suddenly
turned
to
debussy
she
played
a
most
difficult
thing
of
his
i
ca
remember
its
name
then
she
stopped
do
you
like
debussy
i
asked
no
not
always
then
why
did
you
play
it
i
supposed
you
would
if
you
had
said
in
plain
words
think
you
are
a
rotter
who
wants
first
dance
music
then
an
unrestful
modern
decadent
brilliantly
clever
set
of
disharmonies
you
could
not
have
expressed
your
opinion
of
me
more
plainly
she
remained
silent
i
could
have
boxed
her
ears
i
leaned
back
in
my
chair
perhaps
i
gave
a
short
harsh
sigh
if
a
sigh
can
be
harsh
i
was
conscious
that
i
had
made
some
explosive
sound
she
turned
back
to
the
piano
again
and
began
waterlily
and
then
and
the
same
strange
quivering
came
over
me
that
i
experienced
when
i
heard
the
cooing
of
the
my
nerves
must
be
in
an
awful
rotten
state
then
a
longing
to
start
up
and
break
something
shook
me
break
the
windows
smash
the
lamp
yell
aloud
i
started
to
my
one
leg
and
the
frightful
pain
of
my
sudden
movement
did
me
good
and
steadied
me
miss
sharp
had
left
the
piano
and
came
over
to
me
i
am
afraid
you
did
not
like
that
she
said
i
am
so
sorry
her
voice
was
not
so
cold
as
usual
yes
i
did
i
answered
forgive
me
for
being
an
awful
ass
i
i
love
music
tremendously
you
see
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
i
was
balancing
myself
by
the
table
my
crutch
had
fallen
then
she
put
out
her
hand
can
i
help
you
to
sit
down
again
she
suggested
and
i
let
her
i
wanted
to
feel
her
touch
i
have
never
even
shaken
hands
with
her
before
but
when
i
felt
her
guiding
me
to
the
chair
the
maddest
desire
to
seize
her
came
over
me
to
seize
her
in
my
arms
to
tear
off
those
glasses
to
kiss
those
beautiful
blue
eyes
they
hid
to
hold
her
fragile
scrap
of
a
body
tight
against
my
breast
to
tell
her
that
i
loved
her
and
wanted
to
hold
her
there
mine
and
no
one
in
all
the
world
my
god
what
am
i
writing
i
must
crush
this
nonsense
i
must
be
sane
but
what
an
emotion
the
strongest
i
have
ever
felt
about
a
woman
in
my
life
when
i
was
settled
in
the
chair
again
things
seemed
to
become
blank
for
a
minute
and
then
i
heard
miss
sharp
voice
with
a
tone
could
it
be
of
anxiety
in
it
saying
drink
this
brandy
please
she
must
have
gone
to
the
and
fetched
the
decanter
and
glass
from
the
case
and
poured
it
out
while
i
was
not
noticing
events
i
took
it
again
i
said
i
am
awfully
sorry
i
am
such
an
ass
if
you
are
all
right
now
i
ought
to
go
back
to
my
work
she
remarked
i
nodded
and
she
went
softly
from
the
room
when
i
was
alone
i
used
every
bit
of
my
will
to
calm
myself
i
analysed
the
situation
miss
sharp
loathes
me
i
can
not
hold
her
by
any
means
if
she
decides
to
go
the
only
way
i
can
keep
her
near
me
is
by
continuing
to
be
the
cool
employer
and
to
do
this
i
must
see
her
as
little
as
possible
because
the
profound
disturbance
she
is
able
to
cause
in
me
reacts
upon
my
raw
nerves
and
with
all
the
desire
in
the
world
to
behave
like
a
decent
indifferent
man
the
physical
weakness
wo
let
me
do
so
and
i
am
so
bound
to
make
a
consummate
fool
of
myself
when
i
was
in
the
trenches
and
the
shells
were
coming
and
it
was
beastly
wet
and
verminy
and
uncomfortable
i
never
felt
this
feeble
horrible
quivering
i
know
just
what
funk
is
i
felt
it
the
day
i
did
the
thing
they
gave
me
the
for
this
is
not
exactly
funk
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
was
and
could
crush
it
out
of
myself
oh
if
i
could
only
fight
again
that
was
the
best
sensation
in
life
the
zest
the
zest
what
is
it
which
prompts
us
to
do
decent
actions
i
can
not
remember
that
i
felt
any
exaltation
specially
it
just
seemed
part
of
the
day
work
but
how
one
slept
how
one
enjoyed
any
old
thing
would
it
be
better
to
end
it
all
and
go
out
quite
but
where
should
i
go
the
would
not
be
i
am
beginning
to
believe
in
reincarnation
such
queer
things
happened
among
the
fellows
i
suppose
i
be
born
again
as
ugly
of
soul
as
i
am
now
i
must
send
for
some
books
upon
the
subject
and
read
it
up
perhaps
that
might
give
me
serenity
the
duchesse
returned
yesterday
i
shall
go
and
see
her
this
afternoon
i
think
perhaps
she
could
suggest
some
definite
useful
work
i
could
do
it
is
so
abominably
difficult
not
being
able
to
get
about
what
did
she
say
she
said
i
could
pray
i
remember
she
had
not
time
she
said
but
the
understood
i
wonder
if
he
understands
me
or
am
i
too
utterly
rotten
for
him
to
bother
about
the
duchesse
was
so
pleased
to
see
me
she
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
nicholas
thou
art
better
she
said
as
i
told
you
the
war
is
going
to
end
well
and
how
is
the
book
she
asked
presently
it
should
be
finished
i
am
told
that
your
work
is
intermittent
my
mind
jumped
to
maurice
as
the
connecting
link
the
duchesse
of
course
must
have
seen
him
but
i
myself
have
seen
very
little
of
maurice
lately
how
did
he
know
my
work
was
intermittent
maurice
told
you
i
said
maurice
her
once
lovely
eyes
opened
wide
she
has
a
habit
of
screwing
them
up
sometimes
when
she
takes
off
her
do
you
suppose
i
have
been
on
a
de
my
son
that
i
should
have
encountered
maurice
i
dared
not
ask
who
was
her
informant
yes
i
work
for
several
days
in
succession
and
then
i
have
no
ideas
it
is
a
pretty
poor
performance
anyway
and
is
not
likely
to
find
a
publisher
you
are
content
with
your
secretary
this
was
said
with
an
air
of
complete
indifference
there
was
no
meaning
in
it
of
the
kind
madame
de
clerté
would
have
instilled
into
the
tone
yes
she
is
wonderfully
diligent
it
is
impossible
to
dislodge
her
for
a
moment
from
her
work
she
thinks
me
a
poor
creature
i
expect
the
duchesse
eyes
half
closed
now
were
watching
me
keenly
why
should
she
think
that
nicholas
you
ca
after
all
fight
no
but
get
well
my
boy
and
these
silly
introspective
fancies
will
leave
you
self
analysis
all
the
time
for
those
who
sit
still
they
imagine
that
they
matter
to
the
as
much
as
a
you
are
right
duchesse
that
is
why
i
said
miss
sharp
my
typist
probably
thinks
me
a
poor
creature
she
gets
at
my
thoughts
when
i
dictate
you
must
master
your
thoughts
and
then
with
a
total
change
of
subject
she
remarked
thou
art
not
in
love
nicholas
i
felt
a
hot
flush
rise
to
my
face
what
an
idiotic
thing
to
do
more
silly
than
a
girl
again
how
i
resent
physical
weakness
reacting
on
my
nerves
in
love
i
laughed
a
little
angrily
with
whom
could
i
possibly
be
in
love
you
would
not
suggest
that
odette
or
coralie
or
alice
could
cause
such
an
emotion
oh
for
them
perhaps
no
they
are
for
the
senses
of
men
they
are
the
exotic
flowers
of
this
forcing
time
they
have
their
uses
although
i
myself
abhor
them
as
types
but
is
there
no
one
else
solonge
de
clerté
daisy
ryven
both
with
husbands
not
as
if
that
prevented
things
the
duchesse
announced
reflectively
well
well
some
of
my
show
just
your
symptoms
nicholas
and
i
discover
almost
immediately
it
is
because
they
are
in
love
with
the
brain
with
the
imagination
you
must
understand
that
is
the
only
dangerous
kind
when
it
is
with
a
pretty
face
alone
a
good
dose
and
a
new
book
helps
greatly
there
would
be
no
use
in
my
being
in
love
duchesse
it
would
depend
upon
the
woman
you
want
sympathy
and
a
guiding
hand
sympathy
and
a
guiding
hand
i
liked
ruling
and
leading
when
i
was
a
man
we
all
have
our
ups
and
downs
i
like
my
own
bed
but
last
night
an
extra
batch
of
came
in
and
i
had
to
give
it
up
to
one
whose
back
was
a
mass
of
festers
he
would
have
lain
on
the
floor
else
what
will
you
we
have
to
learn
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
conditions
my
son
suddenly
the
picture
of
this
noble
woman
courage
came
to
me
vividly
her
unvarying
resourcefulness
her
common
sense
her
sympathy
with
humanity
her
cheerfulness
i
never
heard
her
complain
or
repine
even
when
fate
took
her
only
son
at
verdun
such
as
these
are
the
glory
of
france
and
coralie
and
odette
and
alice
seemed
to
melt
into
nothingness
the
war
will
be
finished
this
autumn
she
told
me
presently
and
then
our
difficult
time
will
begin
quarrels
for
all
the
world
not
good
fighting
but
you
will
live
to
see
a
renaissance
nicholas
and
so
prepare
for
it
what
can
i
do
dear
friend
if
you
knew
how
much
i
want
to
do
something
your
first
duty
is
to
get
have
yourself
patched
together
finished
so
to
speak
and
then
marry
and
found
a
family
to
take
the
place
of
all
who
have
perished
it
was
good
taste
when
i
was
young
not
to
have
too
many
but
now
france
wants
children
and
england
too
there
is
a
duty
for
you
nicholas
i
kissed
her
hand
if
i
could
find
a
woman
like
you
i
cried
indeed
then
i
would
worship
her
so
so
there
are
hundreds
such
as
i
when
i
was
young
i
lived
as
youth
lives
you
must
not
be
too
critical
nicholas
she
was
called
away
then
back
to
one
of
the
wards
and
i
hobbled
down
the
beautiful
staircases
by
myself
the
lift
was
not
working
the
descent
was
painful
and
i
felt
hot
and
tired
when
i
reached
the
ground
floor
it
was
quite
dusk
then
and
the
one
light
had
not
yet
been
lit
a
slight
wisp
of
a
figure
passed
along
the
end
of
the
corridor
i
could
not
see
plainly
but
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
miss
sharp
i
called
her
name
but
no
one
answered
me
so
i
went
on
out
the
servant
aged
ninety
now
joining
me
he
assisted
me
into
my
one
horse
victoria
beyond
the
concierge
lodge
miss
sharp
and
the
duchesse
why
if
this
is
so
have
i
never
been
told
about
it
the
very
moment
maurice
returns
i
must
get
him
to
investigate
all
about
the
girl
in
the
meantime
i
think
i
shall
go
to
versailles
i
can
not
stand
paris
any
longer
and
the
can
come
out
there
it
is
not
an
impossible
distance
away
vii
reservoires
versailles
september
how
i
love
versailles
the
jolliest
old
hole
on
earth
i
wonder
why
one
uses
slang
like
this
i
had
written
those
words
as
an
exact
reflection
of
my
thoughts
and
nothing
could
be
more
inexact
as
a
description
of
versailles
it
is
as
far
from
being
jolly
as
a
place
can
be
nor
is
it
a
hole
it
is
the
greatest
monument
which
the
vanity
of
one
man
ever
erected
and
like
all
other
superlatives
it
holds
and
interests
if
the
squandered
millions
to
build
it
france
has
reaped
billions
from
the
pockets
of
strangers
who
have
come
to
look
at
it
and
so
everything
that
is
well
done
brings
its
good
each
statue
is
a
personal
friend
of
mine
and
since
i
was
a
boy
i
have
been
in
love
with
the
delicious
nymph
with
the
shell
at
the
bottom
of
the
descent
before
you
come
to
the
on
the
right
hand
side
she
has
two
dimples
in
her
back
i
like
to
touch
them
why
did
i
not
come
here
sooner
i
am
at
peace
with
the
world
burton
wheels
me
up
onto
the
terrace
every
evening
to
watch
the
sunset
from
the
top
of
the
great
steps
all
the
masterpieces
are
covered
with
pent
houses
of
concrete
faced
with
straw
but
the
lesser
gods
and
goddesses
must
take
their
chance
and
sitting
here
with
peaceful
families
near
me
old
gentlemen
soldiers
on
leave
a
pretty
war
widow
with
a
great
white
dog
children
with
spades
all
watching
the
glorious
sky
seated
in
groups
on
the
little
iron
park
chairs
a
sense
of
stupefaction
comes
over
me
for
a
hundred
or
two
kilometres
away
men
are
killing
one
another
women
are
searching
for
some
trace
of
their
homes
the
ground
is
teeming
with
corpses
the
air
is
foetid
with
the
smell
of
death
and
yet
we
enjoy
the
opal
sunset
at
versailles
and
smile
at
the
quaint
appearance
of
the
camouflaged
bronzes
thus
custom
deadens
all
painful
recollections
and
so
are
we
able
to
live
i
wonder
what
louis
xiv
would
say
if
he
could
return
and
be
among
us
he
with
all
his
faults
being
a
well
bred
person
would
probably
adapt
himself
to
circumstances
as
the
duchesse
does
suzette
suggested
that
she
should
come
and
stay
the
week
end
out
here
she
wants
change
of
air
she
says
i
have
miss
sharp
does
not
bring
her
eternal
block
and
pencil
until
tuesday
when
suzette
will
have
left
now
that
i
am
peaceful
and
have
forgotten
my
perturbations
suzette
will
jolly
me
up
i
have
used
the
right
term
there
suzette
does
jolly
one
i
feel
i
could
write
out
here
but
not
about
william
and
mary
furniture
i
could
write
a
cynical
story
of
the
duc
de
armande
the
present
duc
tells
me
that
he
has
a
dispatch
box
filled
with
the
love
letters
his
ancestor
received
their
preservation
owed
to
a
faithful
valet
who
kept
them
all
separated
in
bundles
tied
with
different
ribbons
and
every
lock
of
hair
and
souvenir
attached
to
there
is
an
idea
i
wonder
if
burton
has
ever
thought
of
keeping
mine
he
would
not
have
had
a
heavy
job
in
these
last
years
i
read
all
the
mornings
seated
in
the
sun
i
read
plato
i
want
to
furbish
up
my
greek
for
no
reason
on
earth
except
that
it
is
difficult
and
perhaps
if
i
start
doing
difficult
things
i
may
get
more
will
suzette
arrived
in
an
entirely
new
set
of
garments
the
had
altered
she
said
one
had
to
have
a
different
look
and
she
was
sure
the
autumn
fashions
would
be
even
more
pronounced
as
you
can
readily
understand
my
friend
one
can
not
be
dans
le
especially
in
war
time
naturally
i
agreed
with
her
the
only
unfortunate
part
is
that
it
obliged
me
to
break
into
the
sum
for
georgine
education
that
is
at
least
reparable
i
answered
and
reached
for
my
suzette
is
such
a
good
little
sort
and
clothes
give
her
pleasure
and
fancy
being
able
to
give
for
a
few
thousand
francs
pleasure
not
comfort
or
charity
or
any
respectable
thing
but
just
the
only
worry
about
this
cheque
was
that
suzette
was
a
little
too
affectionate
after
it
i
would
nearly
always
rather
only
talk
to
her
now
she
accompanied
my
bath
chair
on
to
the
terrace
her
ridiculous
little
outline
and
high
heels
contradicting
all
ideas
of
balance
and
yet
presenting
an
indescribable
elegance
she
prattled
gaily
then
when
no
one
was
looking
she
slipped
her
hand
into
mine
cher
mon
petit
chou
she
said
we
had
the
gayest
dinner
in
my
the
war
was
certainly
nearing
its
close
toinette
the
friend
of
one
of
the
generals
assured
her
people
were
thoroughly
bored
and
it
was
an
excellent
thing
to
finish
it
but
even
when
peace
comes
never
again
the
restaurants
open
all
night
to
dance
nicholas
there
is
a
sadness
my
friend
that
was
one
of
the
really
bad
aspects
of
wars
the
way
they
upset
people
habits
she
told
me
even
le
things
became
of
an
uncertainty
one
was
never
sure
if
the
would
not
be
killed
and
it
might
be
difficult
to
replace
him
advantageously
it
is
perhaps
fortunate
for
you
that
i
am
wounded
and
an
institution
suzette
thou
nicholas
just
as
if
i
did
not
understand
i
represent
nothing
but
an
agreeable
passing
of
some
moments
to
thee
thou
art
not
an
not
even
a
little
pretense
of
loving
me
thou
showest
but
you
said
you
never
allowed
yourself
to
care
perhaps
i
have
the
same
idea
she
shook
with
laughter
an
artist
at
love
thou
nicholas
but
no
lover
it
is
a
nice
distinction
would
you
like
me
better
if
i
were
a
lover
we
have
before
spoken
of
this
if
you
were
a
lover
that
is
if
you
loved
you
would
be
dangerous
even
with
your
one
leg
and
your
one
eye
a
woman
could
be
foolish
for
you
there
is
that
air
of
that
air
of
mocking
of
dieu
something
which
i
find
my
word
for
thou
art
chic
i
wished
then
that
i
had
made
the
cheque
larger
because
there
was
something
in
her
merry
black
eyes
which
told
me
she
meant
what
she
said
at
the
moment
i
must
be
grateful
to
my
money
though
after
all
i
could
not
be
or
a
without
it
thus
we
get
back
to
material
things
again
i
wonder
if
material
things
could
affect
miss
sharp
one
side
of
her
certainly
or
she
could
not
have
played
that
dance
music
what
can
she
think
about
all
day
certainly
not
my
affairs
attending
to
them
must
be
purely
mechanical
i
know
she
is
not
stupid
she
plays
beautifully
she
thinks
she
has
an
air
and
knowledge
of
the
world
if
i
were
not
so
afraid
of
losing
her
i
would
act
toward
her
quite
differently
i
would
chance
annoying
her
by
making
her
talk
but
that
fear
holds
me
back
george
harcourt
says
that
between
men
and
women
no
matter
what
the
relation
may
be
one
or
the
other
holds
the
reins
and
is
the
real
arbiter
of
things
and
that
if
you
find
yourself
not
in
the
happy
position
of
master
there
are
many
occasions
when
a
man
must
look
i
feel
ridiculous
when
i
think
about
miss
sharp
i
am
demand
and
she
is
supply
i
am
wanting
every
moment
of
her
time
and
to
know
all
her
thoughts
and
she
is
entirely
uninterested
in
me
and
grants
nothing
suzette
left
last
evening
in
the
best
of
moods
i
made
the
cheque
larger
and
now
i
am
awaiting
miss
sharp
in
my
i
love
this
hotel
it
has
an
air
of
indifference
about
it
which
is
soothing
and
the
food
is
excellent
miss
sharp
arrived
about
eleven
her
cheeks
were
quite
pink
when
she
came
in
and
i
could
see
she
was
warm
with
i
wish
i
had
remembered
to
send
to
the
station
to
meet
her
do
you
think
we
shall
be
able
to
work
here
i
asked
her
we
have
only
the
chapter
to
do
and
then
the
book
will
be
finished
why
not
here
as
well
as
any
other
place
does
not
environment
matter
to
you
i
suppose
it
would
if
i
were
creating
it
it
does
not
matter
now
do
you
ever
write
i
mean
write
on
your
own
sometimes
what
sort
of
things
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
said
as
though
she
regretted
having
to
speak
the
i
write
a
journal
i
could
not
prevent
myself
from
replying
too
eagerly
oh
i
should
like
to
see
it
er
i
write
one
too
she
was
silent
i
felt
nervous
again
do
you
put
down
your
impressions
of
people
and
things
i
suppose
so
why
does
one
write
a
journal
i
wanted
to
hear
what
she
would
answer
one
writes
journals
if
one
is
lonely
yes
that
is
true
then
you
are
lonely
again
she
conveyed
to
me
the
impression
that
i
had
shown
bad
taste
in
asking
a
personal
question
and
i
felt
this
to
be
unjust
because
in
justice
she
would
have
been
forced
to
admit
that
her
words
were
a
challenge
you
explain
to
me
why
one
writes
journals
and
then
when
i
presume
upon
the
inference
you
snub
me
you
are
not
fair
miss
sharp
it
would
be
better
to
stick
to
business
was
all
she
answered
will
you
dictate
please
i
was
utterly
exasperated
no
i
wo
if
you
only
admit
by
inference
that
you
are
lonely
i
say
it
right
out
i
am
abominably
lonely
this
morning
and
i
want
to
talk
to
did
i
see
you
at
the
duchesse
de
on
wednesday
last
possibly
i
literally
had
not
the
pluck
to
ask
her
what
she
was
doing
there
however
she
went
on
there
are
still
many
wounded
who
require
bandages
that
was
it
of
course
she
was
bringing
bandages
she
is
a
splendid
woman
the
duchesse
she
was
a
friend
of
my
mother
i
said
miss
sharp
looked
down
suddenly
she
had
her
head
turned
towards
the
window
there
are
many
splendid
women
in
france
but
you
do
see
them
the
poor
are
too
wonderful
they
lose
their
nearest
and
dearest
and
never
complain
they
only
say
it
is
have
you
any
near
relations
fighting
yes
it
was
too
stupid
having
to
drag
information
out
of
her
like
this
i
gave
it
up
and
then
i
was
haunted
by
the
desire
to
know
what
relations
they
were
if
she
has
a
father
he
must
be
at
least
fifty
and
he
must
be
in
the
english
army
why
then
does
she
seem
so
poor
it
ca
be
a
brother
her
is
only
thirteen
would
a
cousin
count
as
a
near
relation
or
can
she
have
a
the
sudden
idea
of
this
caused
me
a
nasty
twinge
but
no
her
third
finger
has
no
ring
on
i
grew
calmer
again
i
feel
you
have
a
hundred
thousand
interesting
things
to
say
if
you
would
only
talk
i
blurted
out
at
last
i
am
not
here
to
talk
sir
nicholas
i
am
here
to
do
your
typing
does
that
make
a
complete
barrier
wo
you
be
friends
with
me
burton
came
into
the
room
at
that
moment
and
while
he
was
there
she
slipped
off
to
her
typing
without
answering
me
burton
has
arranged
a
place
for
her
in
his
room
which
is
next
to
mine
so
that
i
shall
not
be
disturbed
by
the
noise
of
her
machine
clicking
miss
sharp
must
lunch
with
me
i
said
burton
coughed
as
he
answered
very
good
sir
nicholas
that
meant
that
he
did
not
approve
of
this
arrangement
why
really
these
old
servants
are
unsupportable
the
antediluvian
waiters
come
in
to
lay
the
table
presently
and
i
ordered
peaches
and
grapes
and
some
very
special
chablis
i
felt
exultant
at
my
having
manoeuvred
that
miss
sharp
should
eat
with
me
she
came
in
when
all
was
ready
with
her
usual
serene
calm
and
took
her
place
at
right
angles
to
me
her
hands
are
not
nearly
so
red
and
their
movements
when
she
began
to
eat
pleased
me
her
wrists
are
tiny
and
everything
she
does
is
dainty
she
did
not
peck
her
food
like
a
bird
as
very
slight
people
sometimes
do
and
she
was
entirely
at
ease
it
was
i
who
was
nervous
wo
you
take
off
your
glasses
i
suggested
but
she
declined
of
what
use
i
can
see
with
them
on
this
disconcerted
me
the
waiter
poured
out
the
chablis
carefully
she
took
it
casually
without
a
remark
but
for
an
instant
a
cynical
expression
grew
round
her
mouth
what
was
she
thinking
of
it
is
impossible
to
tell
not
seeing
her
eyes
but
some
cynical
thought
was
certainly
connected
with
the
wine
by
the
direction
of
her
head
she
may
have
been
reading
the
label
on
the
bottle
does
she
know
how
much
it
cost
and
disapprove
of
that
in
war
time
or
what
we
talked
of
french
politics
next
that
is
she
answered
everything
i
said
with
intelligence
and
then
let
the
subject
drop
immediately
nothing
could
be
more
exasperating
because
i
knew
it
was
deliberate
and
not
that
she
is
stupid
or
could
not
keep
up
the
most
profound
conversation
she
seemed
to
know
the
war
situation
very
well
then
i
began
about
french
literature
and
at
the
end
of
the
meal
had
dragged
out
enough
replies
to
my
questions
to
know
that
she
is
an
exquisitely
cultivated
person
oh
what
a
companion
she
would
make
if
only
i
could
break
down
this
wretched
barrier
of
her
reserve
she
ate
a
peach
and
i
do
hope
she
liked
it
but
she
refused
a
cigarette
when
i
offered
her
one
i
do
smoke
oh
i
am
so
sorry
i
did
not
know
and
i
put
out
mine
you
need
not
do
that
i
do
mind
other
people
smoking
so
long
as
i
need
not
do
it
myself
i
another
one
do
you
know
i
believe
i
shall
have
my
new
eye
put
in
before
christmas
i
told
her
just
before
she
rose
from
the
table
and
for
the
first
time
i
have
known
her
the
faintest
smile
came
round
her
mouth
a
kindly
smile
i
am
so
very
glad
she
said
and
all
over
me
there
crept
a
thrill
of
pleasure
after
lunch
i
suggested
the
and
that
i
should
dictate
in
some
lovely
cool
spot
she
made
no
objection
and
immediately
put
on
her
hat
a
plain
dark
blue
straw
she
walked
a
little
behind
my
bath
chair
as
we
turned
out
of
the
reservoires
courtyard
and
began
ascending
the
avenue
in
the
so
that
i
could
not
converse
with
her
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
i
called
to
her
miss
sharp
she
advanced
and
kept
beside
me
does
not
this
place
interest
you
awfully
i
hazarded
yes
do
you
know
it
well
yes
what
does
it
say
to
you
it
is
ever
a
reminder
of
what
to
avoid
what
to
avoid
but
it
is
perfectly
beautiful
why
should
you
want
to
avoid
beauty
i
do
not
it
is
what
this
was
meant
to
stand
for
and
what
human
beings
failed
in
allowing
it
to
do
that
is
the
lesson
i
was
frightfully
interested
tell
me
what
you
mean
the
architects
were
great
the
king
thought
was
great
but
only
in
one
way
and
everyone
the
whole
class
forgot
the
real
meaning
of
and
abused
their
power
and
so
the
revolution
swept
them
away
they
put
false
value
upon
everything
false
values
upon
birth
and
breeding
and
no
value
upon
their
consequent
obligations
or
upon
character
you
believe
in
acknowledging
your
obligations
i
know
yes
i
hope
so
think
in
that
palace
the
immense
importance
which
was
given
to
etiquette
and
forms
and
ceremonies
and
to
a
quite
ridiculous
false
sense
of
honour
they
could
ruin
their
poor
tradesmen
and
yet
yes
i
interrupted
it
was
odd
was
it
a
gentleman
was
still
a
gentleman
never
paying
his
tailor
bills
but
ceased
to
be
one
if
he
cheated
at
cards
miss
sharp
suddenly
dropped
her
dark
blue
parasol
and
bent
to
pick
it
up
again
and
as
she
did
she
changed
the
conversation
by
remarking
that
there
were
an
unusual
quantity
of
aeroplanes
buzzing
from
buc
this
was
unlike
her
i
can
not
think
why
she
did
so
i
wanted
to
steer
her
back
to
the
subject
of
versailles
and
its
meaning
burton
puffed
a
little
as
we
went
up
the
rather
steep
slope
by
the
du
and
miss
sharp
put
her
hand
on
the
bar
and
helped
him
to
push
the
chair
is
it
not
hateful
for
me
being
such
a
burden
i
could
not
help
saying
it
leaves
you
more
time
to
think
well
that
is
no
blessing
that
is
the
agony
thinking
it
should
not
be
to
have
time
to
think
must
be
wonderful
and
she
sighed
unconsciously
over
me
came
a
kind
of
rush
of
tenderness
i
wanted
to
be
strong
again
and
protect
her
and
make
her
life
easy
and
give
her
time
and
love
and
everything
in
the
world
she
could
wish
for
but
i
dared
not
say
anything
and
she
hung
back
again
a
little
and
once
more
it
made
the
conversation
difficult
and
when
we
reached
a
sheltered
spot
by
the
du
i
felt
there
was
a
sort
of
armour
around
her
and
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
go
straight
to
work
and
not
talk
further
she
went
directly
from
the
to
catch
her
train
at
five
and
i
was
wheeled
back
to
the
hotel
and
now
i
have
the
evening
alone
before
me
but
the
day
is
distinctly
a
step
onward
in
the
friendship
line
viii
i
spent
a
memorable
day
with
miss
sharp
in
the
yesterday
i
do
not
even
remember
what
i
did
in
the
intermediate
time
it
seems
of
so
little
importance
but
this
thursday
will
always
stand
out
as
a
landmark
of
our
acquaintance
we
drove
in
a
fiacre
to
the
little
trianon
after
she
arrived
with
burton
on
the
box
to
help
me
out
and
then
i
walked
with
my
crutch
to
a
delicious
spot
i
know
rather
near
the
grotto
and
yet
with
a
view
of
the
house
i
was
determined
i
would
entice
her
to
talk
as
much
as
i
could
and
began
very
cautiously
so
as
not
to
provoke
her
to
suggest
work
have
you
ever
read
that
wonderful
story
called
adventure
the
two
old
ladies
seeing
marie
antoinette
and
some
other
ghosts
here
no
so
i
told
her
about
it
and
how
they
had
accounted
for
it
i
expect
it
was
true
she
said
you
believe
in
ghosts
then
some
ghosts
i
wish
i
did
then
i
should
know
that
there
is
a
beyond
i
felt
she
was
looking
surprised
but
of
course
there
is
a
beyond
we
have
all
been
there
many
times
during
our
evolution
after
each
life
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
about
that
theory
of
reincarnation
i
responded
eagerly
can
you
tell
me
i
could
get
you
a
book
about
it
i
would
much
rather
hear
it
personally
explained
the
merest
outline
please
tell
me
it
might
help
me
not
to
be
such
a
rotter
she
looked
away
toward
the
giant
trees
her
mouth
had
a
slightly
sad
expression
i
could
have
torn
those
glasses
off
her
blue
eyes
we
came
up
through
the
animal
group
soul
and
finally
were
individualized
into
man
and
from
then
onward
the
life
on
this
earth
is
but
a
school
for
us
to
learn
experience
in
to
prepare
us
eventually
for
higher
spheres
when
we
advance
far
enough
we
need
not
be
again
yes
as
a
theory
i
follow
that
she
went
on
everything
is
and
we
draw
the
result
of
every
action
we
commit
good
or
bad
and
sometimes
it
is
not
until
the
next
we
pay
for
the
bad
ones
or
receive
the
result
of
the
good
ones
is
that
why
then
that
i
am
a
cripple
and
life
seems
a
beastly
affair
of
course
you
drew
that
upon
yourself
by
some
actions
in
your
last
life
also
it
may
be
to
teach
you
some
lesson
in
the
improvement
of
the
soul
i
do
seem
to
have
learned
anything
i
believe
i
am
rebellious
all
the
time
probably
miss
sharp
you
could
really
help
me
if
you
would
please
explain
to
me
i
will
be
a
diligent
pupil
perhaps
you
were
in
a
position
of
great
power
the
last
time
and
were
lavish
and
kind
to
people
in
a
way
or
you
would
not
be
so
rich
now
but
you
caused
suffering
and
relied
upon
yourself
not
on
anything
divine
you
must
have
caused
much
suffering
perhaps
mentally
even
and
so
you
had
to
be
and
be
wounded
to
teach
you
the
lesson
of
it
all
that
is
called
your
karma
our
karma
is
what
we
bring
on
with
us
from
life
to
life
in
the
way
of
obligations
which
we
must
discharge
so
you
see
it
rests
with
each
one
of
us
not
to
lay
up
more
debts
to
pay
in
the
future
her
refined
voice
was
level
as
though
she
were
controlling
herself
not
to
allow
any
personal
feeling
to
enter
her
discourse
her
gloved
hands
were
perfectly
still
in
her
lap
she
was
in
profile
to
me
so
that
i
could
see
that
her
very
long
eyelashes
seemed
to
be
rather
pressed
against
the
glasses
i
have
not
before
been
so
close
to
her
in
a
bright
why
does
she
wear
those
damned
spectacles
i
was
thinking
when
she
said
you
find
it
hard
to
be
confined
to
your
chair
and
not
to
be
able
to
fight
do
you
well
when
you
could
fight
it
was
not
always
the
pleasure
of
going
over
the
top
you
had
to
have
times
in
the
trenches
too
had
you
when
you
just
had
to
bear
it
of
course
well
you
are
in
the
trenches
now
do
you
see
and
it
is
according
to
how
your
soul
learns
the
lesson
of
them
as
to
whether
in
this
life
you
will
ever
be
allowed
to
go
over
the
top
again
or
even
to
have
peace
what
is
the
lesson
i
am
not
god
i
can
not
tell
you
but
we
would
all
know
what
our
lesson
to
learn
is
if
we
were
not
too
vain
to
face
the
truth
into
ourselves
the
aim
being
why
of
course
to
improve
character
and
learn
strength
what
qualities
do
you
most
admire
in
a
person
miss
sharp
self
control
and
strength
you
have
no
sympathy
with
weaklings
none
whatever
bad
strong
people
are
better
than
weak
good
ones
i
knew
this
was
true
this
fragile
creature
suggests
infinite
repose
and
strength
what
could
she
have
done
in
a
former
life
to
bring
her
back
in
such
unkind
surroundings
that
she
must
spend
her
days
in
drudgery
so
that
she
has
never
even
leisure
to
think
i
longed
to
ask
her
but
did
not
dare
shall
we
not
begin
work
now
she
suggested
and
i
demonstrated
my
first
lesson
in
self
control
by
agreeing
and
we
did
not
talk
again
until
luncheon
time
if
you
do
mind
we
shall
go
to
the
little
café
by
the
i
said
and
then
afterwards
we
can
find
another
place
and
work
again
burton
will
have
had
my
wheeled
chair
brought
down
there
so
we
can
choose
a
decent
spot
in
one
of
the
she
nodded
slightly
now
that
it
was
not
to
help
my
moral
regeneration
she
did
not
intend
to
talk
any
more
it
seemed
as
we
got
into
the
fiacre
i
slipped
in
the
slightest
degree
and
caught
on
to
her
arm
it
was
bare
to
the
elbow
in
the
little
cheap
cotton
frock
and
as
i
touched
the
fine
fine
skin
that
maddening
feeling
came
over
me
again
to
clasp
her
in
my
i
pulled
myself
together
and
she
got
in
beside
me
she
has
a
darling
tiny
curl
which
comes
behind
her
ear
slipped
down
probably
because
her
hair
is
so
unfashionably
dressed
none
of
suzette
nor
even
the
subtle
perfect
taste
of
the
it
is
just
torn
back
and
rolled
into
a
tight
twist
but
now
that
i
see
her
out
of
doors
and
in
perspective
i
realize
that
she
has
a
lovely
small
figure
and
that
everything
is
in
the
right
place
i
had
told
burton
to
order
the
nicest
lunch
he
could
think
of
in
that
simple
place
and
our
table
under
one
of
the
umbrellas
was
waiting
for
us
when
we
arrived
there
were
only
four
other
people
there
besides
ourselves
and
a
few
came
in
afterwards
i
had
forgotten
my
bread
tickets
so
miss
sharp
gave
me
one
of
hers
she
had
relapsed
into
absolute
silence
the
only
words
she
had
uttered
as
we
came
down
that
avenue
from
the
trianon
to
the
were
when
i
exclaimed
at
the
beauty
of
it
i
judged
by
her
mouth
that
she
was
admiring
it
too
and
she
said
softly
for
me
versailles
is
the
loveliest
spot
on
earth
my
mind
flew
then
to
the
thought
of
what
it
would
be
to
buy
a
really
nice
house
here
and
spend
the
summers
with
her
for
my
own
i
found
myself
clutching
at
my
crutch
i
tried
to
make
conversation
at
lunch
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
difficult
as
to
keep
this
up
when
you
are
nervous
with
interest
and
the
other
person
is
determined
not
to
say
a
sentence
which
is
unnecessary
a
chill
crept
over
me
burton
turned
up
in
time
to
pay
the
bill
and
put
me
into
my
chair
i
do
think
you
look
well
enough
to
stay
out
the
afternoon
sir
nicholas
he
said
better
go
straight
back
to
the
hotel
and
rest
miss
sharp
joined
in
i
was
going
to
say
that
she
said
i
felt
like
a
cross
disappointed
child
i
knew
they
were
both
right
though
i
was
feeling
pretty
tired
and
had
not
an
idea
in
my
head
but
if
i
did
that
there
would
be
a
chance
to
see
her
lost
and
all
the
long
hours
to
face
alone
i
am
quite
all
right
and
i
want
to
work
i
said
fretfully
and
we
started
off
we
went
up
through
the
lovely
past
and
on
to
the
du
miss
sharp
walking
a
little
behind
my
chair
here
burton
bent
over
me
it
would
be
good
for
you
to
be
taking
a
nap
sir
nicholas
indeed
it
would
it
seemed
as
if
miss
sharp
was
abetting
him
for
she
came
to
my
side
if
you
can
get
quite
comfortable
i
would
read
to
you
and
you
might
sleep
she
said
we
no
book
i
retorted
peeved
and
yet
pleased
at
the
idea
i
have
one
here
which
will
do
and
she
took
a
little
volume
from
her
i
have
wanted
it
for
a
long
time
and
i
bought
it
at
the
as
i
came
from
the
station
it
cost
a
franc
it
was
a
worn
eighteenth
century
copy
of
françois
villon
yes
that
will
be
nice
i
agreed
and
leaned
back
while
burton
settled
my
cushion
and
then
retired
to
a
distance
twelve
years
on
and
off
of
paris
has
not
taught
him
french
at
least
not
the
french
of
françois
villon
miss
sharp
took
a
little
chair
and
i
was
able
to
watch
her
as
she
read
i
did
not
even
hear
the
words
because
as
she
was
looking
down
i
had
not
to
guard
myself
but
could
let
my
eye
devour
her
small
oval
face
all
my
nerves
were
thrilling
again
and
there
was
no
peace
how
i
longed
ached
to
take
her
into
my
arms
she
looked
up
once
after
an
hour
to
see
if
i
were
asleep
i
she
must
have
observed
passionate
emotion
in
my
eye
she
looked
down
at
the
book
instantly
but
a
soft
pink
flush
came
into
her
cheeks
which
have
a
mother
of
pearl
transparency
usually
this
caused
me
deep
pleasure
i
had
been
able
to
make
her
feel
something
at
any
rate
but
then
i
was
frightened
perhaps
she
would
suggest
going
if
she
found
the
situation
uncomfortable
her
voice
had
a
fresh
tone
in
it
as
she
went
on
and
finally
it
faltered
and
she
stopped
if
it
is
not
putting
you
to
sleep
she
remarked
perhaps
you
would
not
object
if
i
walked
on
and
typed
what
i
took
down
this
morning
it
seems
a
pity
to
waste
this
time
i
knew
that
if
i
did
not
let
her
have
her
way
there
might
be
difficulties
so
i
agreed
and
said
that
i
would
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
rest
upon
the
sofa
in
the
salon
so
the
procession
started
and
as
we
took
the
to
bring
us
to
the
reservoirs
on
the
level
i
suddenly
caught
sight
of
coralie
and
her
last
favoured
one
both
of
whom
are
supposed
to
be
at
deauville
with
the
rest
coralie
was
exquisitely
dressed
duquesnois
in
uniform
i
realized
that
she
had
seen
us
and
that
she
could
not
avoid
coming
up
to
talk
although
that
had
not
been
her
intention
when
one
is
supposed
to
be
at
deauville
with
one
family
and
is
in
reality
at
versailles
with
one
lover
one
does
not
seek
to
recognize
one
friends
she
came
forward
with
when
she
found
the
meeting
was
inevitable
nicholas
she
cooed
what
happiness
then
she
eyed
miss
sharp
mischievously
making
a
movement
as
though
she
expected
me
to
introduce
them
but
miss
sharp
defeated
this
by
immediately
walking
on
said
coralie
that
is
miss
sharp
my
secretary
what
are
you
doing
here
coralie
perhaps
the
same
as
you
and
she
rippled
with
laughter
versailles
is
so
tranquil
a
place
i
could
have
slapped
her
fortunately
miss
sharp
was
out
of
earshot
jean
duquesnois
now
joined
in
he
was
back
from
the
front
for
two
days
things
were
going
better
peace
would
certainly
be
declared
before
christmas
coralie
meanwhile
was
looking
after
miss
sharp
with
an
expression
upon
her
clever
face
which
only
a
frenchwoman
is
able
to
put
there
it
said
as
plainly
as
words
so
this
is
the
reason
nicholas
well
you
have
chosen
something
very
and
inexpensive
this
time
men
are
certainly
crazy
in
their
tastes
i
pretended
not
to
notice
and
so
she
spoke
why
if
you
can
come
here
can
not
you
come
to
deauville
nicholas
there
must
be
some
irresistible
attraction
stronger
than
to
be
with
your
friends
yes
he
is
an
excellent
swedish
masseur
who
is
glued
to
also
i
like
solitude
sometimes
solitude
and
coralie
glanced
at
miss
sharp
rapidly
disappearing
figure
i
would
not
permit
myself
to
grow
angry
the
book
is
nearly
finished
you
can
tell
the
rest
that
old
book
you
were
much
more
entertaining
before
you
commenced
it
nicholas
perhaps
the
idea
has
come
to
me
why
i
would
not
be
drawn
i
threw
the
war
into
the
enemy
country
you
are
staying
at
the
reservoirs
i
saw
that
she
was
and
that
now
the
thought
of
my
being
there
disconcerted
her
but
no
she
lied
sweetly
i
am
merely
out
here
for
the
day
to
see
louise
who
has
a
son
in
the
hospital
it
was
my
turn
to
say
and
then
we
both
laughed
and
i
let
them
go
on
but
when
i
got
into
my
salon
i
heard
no
typing
only
there
was
a
note
from
miss
sharp
to
say
that
some
slight
thing
had
gone
wrong
with
the
machine
so
she
had
taken
the
work
to
finish
it
at
home
i
cursed
coralie
and
all
the
fluffies
in
the
world
and
then
in
pain
laid
down
upon
my
bed
ix
morning
yesterday
i
was
so
restless
i
could
not
settle
to
anything
i
read
pages
and
pages
of
plato
and
was
conscious
that
the
words
were
going
over
in
my
head
without
conveying
the
slightest
meaning
and
that
the
other
part
of
my
mind
was
absorbed
with
thoughts
of
miss
sharp
if
i
only
dared
to
be
natural
with
her
we
surely
could
be
friends
but
i
am
always
obsessed
with
the
fear
that
she
will
leave
me
if
i
transgress
in
the
slightest
beyond
the
line
she
has
marked
between
us
i
see
that
she
is
determined
to
remain
only
the
secretary
and
i
realize
that
it
is
her
breeding
which
makes
her
act
as
she
does
if
she
were
familiar
or
friendly
with
me
she
would
feel
it
was
not
correct
to
come
to
my
flat
alone
she
only
comes
at
all
because
the
money
is
so
necessary
to
her
and
having
to
come
she
protects
her
dignity
by
wearing
this
ice
i
know
that
she
was
affronted
by
coralie
look
on
thursday
and
that
is
why
she
went
home
pretending
the
typing
machine
was
out
of
order
now
if
any
more
of
these
happen
she
will
probably
give
me
warning
burton
instinctively
sensed
this
and
that
is
why
he
disapproved
of
my
asking
her
to
lunch
if
she
had
been
an
ordinary
typist
burton
would
not
have
objected
in
the
least
as
i
said
before
burton
knows
the
world
now
what
is
to
be
done
next
i
would
like
to
go
and
confide
in
the
duchesse
and
tell
her
that
i
believe
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
my
secretary
who
wo
look
at
me
and
ask
her
advice
but
that
i
fear
with
all
her
charity
her
class
prejudice
is
too
strong
to
make
her
really
sympathetic
her
french
mind
of
the
could
not
contemplate
a
thormonde
son
of
anne
de
falling
in
love
with
an
insignificant
miss
sharp
who
brings
bandages
to
the
courville
hospital
these
thoughts
tormented
me
so
all
yesterday
that
i
was
quite
feverish
by
the
evening
and
burton
wore
an
air
of
thorough
disapproval
a
rain
shower
came
on
too
and
i
could
not
go
up
on
the
terrace
for
the
sunset
i
would
like
to
have
taken
asperines
and
gone
to
sleep
when
night
came
but
i
resisted
the
temptation
telling
myself
that
she
would
come
again
i
am
dawdling
over
this
last
chapter
on
purpose
and
i
have
the
former
ones
and
decided
to
rewrite
one
or
two
but
at
best
i
can
not
spread
this
out
over
more
than
six
weeks
i
fear
and
then
what
excuse
can
i
have
for
keeping
her
i
feel
that
she
would
not
stay
just
to
answer
a
few
letters
a
day
and
do
the
accounts
and
pay
the
bills
with
burton
i
feel
more
desperately
miserable
than
i
have
felt
since
last
year
and
i
suppose
that
according
to
her
theory
i
have
to
learn
a
lesson
it
seems
if
i
search
as
she
said
one
must
do
without
vanity
that
the
lesson
is
to
conquer
emotion
and
be
serene
when
everything
which
i
desire
is
out
of
reach
night
has
been
one
of
utter
disaster
and
it
began
fairly
well
miss
sharp
turned
up
at
eleven
as
i
shut
my
journal
i
had
sent
to
the
station
to
meet
her
this
time
she
brought
all
the
work
she
had
taken
away
with
her
on
thursday
quite
in
order
and
her
face
wore
the
usual
mask
i
wonder
if
i
had
not
ever
seen
her
without
her
glasses
if
i
should
have
realized
now
that
she
is
very
pretty
i
can
see
her
prettiness
even
with
them
on
her
nose
is
so
exquisitely
fine
and
the
mouth
a
cupid
bow
really
if
one
can
imagine
a
cupid
bow
very
firm
i
am
sure
if
she
were
dressed
as
odette
or
alice
or
coralie
she
would
be
lovely
this
morning
when
she
first
came
i
began
thinking
of
this
and
of
how
i
should
like
to
give
her
better
things
than
any
of
the
fluffies
have
ever
had
how
i
would
like
her
to
have
some
sapphire
bangles
for
those
little
wrists
and
a
great
string
of
pearls
round
that
little
throat
my
mother
pearls
and
perhaps
big
pearls
in
those
shell
ears
and
how
i
would
like
to
take
her
hair
down
and
brush
it
out
and
let
it
curl
as
it
wanted
to
and
then
bury
my
face
in
it
those
stiff
twists
must
take
heaps
of
hair
to
but
why
am
i
writing
all
this
when
the
reality
is
further
off
than
ever
and
indeed
has
become
an
impossibility
i
fear
we
worked
in
the
it
was
a
cloudy
day
and
presently
after
i
had
been
dreaming
on
in
this
way
i
asked
her
to
read
over
the
earlier
chapters
of
the
she
did
now
what
do
you
think
of
the
thing
as
a
whole
i
asked
her
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
though
trying
not
to
have
to
answer
directly
then
that
weird
constitutional
honesty
seemed
to
force
out
the
words
it
perhaps
tells
what
that
furniture
is
you
feel
it
is
awful
rot
no
what
then
it
depends
if
you
mean
to
publish
it
i
leaned
back
and
laughed
bitterly
the
realization
that
she
understood
so
completely
that
it
was
only
a
an
asperine
for
me
so
to
speak
as
the
duchesse
said
cut
in
like
a
knife
i
had
the
exasperated
feeling
that
i
was
just
being
pandered
to
humored
by
everyone
because
i
was
wounded
i
was
an
object
of
pity
and
even
my
paid
typist
but
i
ca
write
about
it
miss
sharp
started
from
her
chair
her
fine
nostrils
were
quivering
and
her
mouth
had
an
expression
i
could
not
place
indeed
it
is
not
bad
she
said
you
misunderstand
me
i
knew
now
that
she
was
angry
with
herself
for
having
hurt
me
and
that
i
could
have
made
capital
out
of
this
but
something
in
me
would
not
let
me
do
that
oh
it
is
all
right
i
replied
but
perhaps
my
voice
may
have
been
flat
and
discouraged
for
she
went
on
so
kindly
you
know
a
great
deal
about
the
subject
of
course
but
i
feel
the
chapters
want
condensing
may
i
tell
you
just
where
i
felt
that
the
thing
did
not
interest
me
any
more
one
way
or
another
it
was
just
a
ridiculous
i
saw
it
all
in
a
new
perspective
but
i
was
glad
she
seemed
kindly
though
for
a
moment
even
that
appeared
of
less
importance
something
seemed
to
have
numbed
me
what
what
could
be
the
good
of
anything
the
meaning
of
anything
i
unconsciously
put
my
head
back
against
the
cushion
of
my
chair
in
weariness
i
felt
the
soft
silk
and
shut
my
eye
for
a
moment
when
miss
sharp
spoke
again
her
voice
was
full
of
sympathy
and
was
it
remorse
i
would
like
to
help
you
to
take
interest
in
it
again
wo
you
let
me
she
pleaded
i
was
grateful
that
she
did
not
say
she
was
sorry
she
had
hurt
me
that
i
could
not
have
stood
i
opened
my
eye
now
and
looked
at
her
she
was
bending
nearer
to
me
but
i
felt
nothing
particular
only
a
desire
to
go
to
sleep
and
have
done
with
it
all
it
was
as
if
the
fabric
of
my
had
been
rent
asunder
it
is
very
good
of
you
i
answered
politely
yes
say
what
you
think
her
tact
is
immense
she
plunged
straight
into
the
subject
without
further
imputation
of
sympathy
her
voice
full
of
inflections
of
interest
and
friendliness
her
constrained
laid
aside
for
the
time
she
spoke
so
intelligently
showing
trained
critical
faculties
and
at
last
my
numbness
began
gradually
to
melt
and
i
could
not
help
some
return
of
sensation
there
may
have
been
soothing
syrup
in
the
fact
that
she
must
have
been
interested
in
the
work
or
she
could
not
have
dissected
it
chapter
by
chapter
point
by
point
as
she
was
doing
she
grew
animated
as
we
discussed
things
and
once
unconsciously
took
off
her
glasses
it
was
like
the
sun
coming
out
after
days
of
storm
clouds
her
beautiful
beautiful
blue
eyes
my
heart
gave
a
bound
i
believe
that
is
the
way
to
express
what
i
mean
i
felt
a
strange
emotion
of
excitement
and
pleasure
i
had
not
time
to
control
my
admiration
i
expect
for
she
took
fright
and
instantly
replaced
them
a
bright
flush
in
her
cheeks
and
went
on
talking
in
a
more
reserved
way
alas
of
course
then
i
realized
that
she
does
not
wear
the
glasses
for
any
reason
of
softening
light
or
of
defective
sight
but
simply
to
hide
those
blue
stars
and
make
herself
unattractive
how
mysterious
it
all
is
i
wish
i
had
been
able
to
conceal
the
fact
that
i
had
noticed
that
the
glasses
were
off
another
day
i
would
certainly
have
taken
advantage
of
this
moment
and
would
have
tried
to
make
her
confess
the
reason
of
her
wearing
them
but
some
odd
quality
in
me
prevented
me
from
reaping
any
advantage
from
this
situation
so
i
let
the
chance
perhaps
she
was
grateful
to
me
for
she
warmed
up
a
little
again
i
began
to
feel
that
i
might
write
the
fool
of
a
book
right
over
from
the
beginning
and
suggested
to
her
that
we
should
take
it
in
detail
she
acquiesced
then
it
suddenly
struck
me
that
she
had
not
only
spoken
of
style
in
writing
of
method
in
book
making
but
had
shown
an
actual
knowledge
of
the
subject
of
the
furniture
how
could
little
miss
sharp
a
poverty
stricken
typist
be
familiar
with
william
and
mary
furniture
she
has
obviously
not
seen
better
days
and
only
taken
up
a
stenographic
business
lately
because
such
proficiency
as
she
shows
not
only
in
this
work
but
in
account
keeping
and
all
the
duties
of
a
secretary
must
have
required
a
steady
professional
training
could
she
have
studied
in
museums
but
the
war
has
been
on
for
four
years
and
i
had
gathered
that
she
has
been
in
paris
all
that
time
even
if
she
had
left
england
in
she
could
only
have
been
eighteen
or
nineteen
then
and
girls
of
that
age
do
not
generally
take
an
interest
in
furniture
this
thought
kept
bothering
me
and
i
was
silent
for
some
moments
i
was
weighing
things
up
her
voice
interrupted
my
thoughts
the
braxted
chair
has
the
first
of
the
knotted
fringes
known
it
was
saying
i
had
spoken
of
the
braxted
chair
but
had
not
recorded
this
fact
how
the
devil
could
she
have
known
about
it
where
did
you
find
that
i
knew
someone
who
had
seen
it
she
answered
in
the
same
voice
but
her
cheeks
grew
pinker
you
have
never
seen
it
yourself
no
i
have
never
been
in
england
never
been
in
england
i
was
stupefied
she
went
on
hurriedly
i
was
going
to
write
feverishly
so
quickly
did
she
rush
into
questions
of
method
in
arranging
the
chapters
her
armour
was
on
again
she
had
become
cautious
and
was
probably
annoyed
with
herself
for
ever
having
allowed
herself
to
slip
off
her
guard
i
knew
that
i
could
disconcert
her
and
probably
obtain
some
interesting
admissions
from
her
and
have
a
thrilling
fencing
match
but
some
instinct
warned
me
not
to
do
so
i
might
win
out
for
the
time
being
but
if
she
has
a
secret
which
she
does
not
wish
me
to
discover
she
will
take
care
not
again
to
put
herself
in
a
situation
where
this
can
happen
i
have
the
apprehension
always
hanging
like
damocles
sword
over
my
head
of
her
relinquishing
her
post
besides
why
should
i
trouble
her
for
my
own
satisfaction
however
i
registered
a
vow
then
that
i
would
find
out
all
i
could
from
maurice
the
inference
of
everything
she
says
does
and
unconsciously
infers
is
that
she
is
a
cultivated
lady
accustomed
to
talking
with
people
of
our
world
people
who
know
england
and
its
great
houses
well
enough
to
have
made
her
familiar
with
the
knowledge
of
where
certain
pieces
of
famous
furniture
the
very
phrasing
of
her
sentences
is
the
phrasing
of
our
shibboleth
and
not
the
phrasing
of
the
professional
classes
and
yet
she
is
meanly
dressed
does
housework
and
for
years
must
have
been
trained
in
professional
business
methods
it
is
profoundly
interesting
i
have
never
even
questioned
maurice
as
to
how
he
heard
of
her
well
i
write
all
this
down
calmly
the
record
of
the
morning
to
let
myself
look
back
on
it
and
to
where
the
new
intimacy
might
have
led
us
but
for
the
sickening
end
to
the
day
burton
did
not
question
her
lunching
with
me
this
time
he
had
given
the
order
as
a
matter
of
course
he
is
very
fine
in
his
distinctions
and
understood
that
to
make
any
change
after
she
once
had
eaten
with
me
would
be
invidious
by
the
time
the
waiters
came
in
to
lay
the
table
that
sense
of
hurt
and
then
of
numbness
had
worn
off
i
was
quite
interested
again
in
the
work
and
intensely
intrigued
about
the
possible
history
of
the
sharp
family
i
was
using
cunning
too
and
displaying
casual
indifference
so
watchfulness
was
allowed
to
rest
a
little
with
the
strange
girl
i
believe
if
you
will
give
me
your
help
i
shall
be
able
to
make
quite
a
decent
book
of
it
after
all
but
does
it
not
seem
absurd
to
trouble
about
such
thing
as
furniture
with
the
world
in
ruins
and
empires
tottering
i
remarked
while
the
handed
the
omelette
all
that
is
only
temporary
presently
people
will
be
glad
to
take
up
civilized
interests
again
you
never
had
any
doubt
as
to
how
the
war
would
end
never
why
because
i
believe
in
the
gallantry
of
france
and
the
tenacity
of
england
and
the
youth
of
america
and
what
of
germany
the
vulgarity
this
was
quite
a
new
reason
for
germany
certain
downfall
it
delighted
me
but
vulgarity
does
not
mean
weakness
yes
it
does
vulgar
people
have
imperfect
sensibilities
and
can
not
judge
of
the
psychology
of
others
they
appraise
everything
by
their
own
standard
and
so
can
not
calculate
correctly
possible
contingencies
that
shows
weakness
how
wise
you
are
and
how
you
think
she
was
silent
all
the
fighting
nations
will
be
filled
with
vulgarians
even
when
we
do
win
though
with
most
of
the
decent
people
killed
i
ventured
to
say
oh
no
lots
of
their
souls
are
not
vulgar
only
their
environment
has
caused
their
outward
to
seem
so
once
you
get
below
the
pompous
in
france
for
instance
the
more
delightful
you
find
the
spirit
and
i
expect
it
is
the
same
in
england
it
is
the
pretentious
aspiring
who
are
vulgar
and
germany
seems
filled
with
them
you
know
it
well
yes
pretty
well
if
it
is
not
a
frightfully
impertinent
question
how
old
are
you
really
miss
sharp
i
felt
that
she
could
not
be
only
after
this
conversation
she
smiled
the
second
smile
i
have
seen
on
the
twentieth
of
october
i
shall
be
where
on
earth
did
you
learn
all
your
philosophy
of
life
in
the
time
it
is
life
which
teaches
us
everything
if
we
are
not
half
asleep
especially
if
it
is
difficult
and
the
stupid
people
are
like
me
not
liking
to
learn
any
lessons
and
kicking
against
the
pricks
yes
i
would
try
to
learn
anything
you
would
teach
me
though
miss
sharp
why
because
i
have
confidence
in
you
i
did
not
add
because
i
loved
her
voice
and
respected
her
character
and
thank
you
she
said
will
you
teach
me
what
how
not
to
be
a
rotter
a
man
knows
that
himself
how
to
learn
serenity
then
that
would
be
difficult
am
i
so
impossible
i
can
not
say
but
but
what
one
would
have
to
begin
from
the
beginning
well
and
i
have
not
time
i
looked
at
her
as
she
said
this
there
was
in
the
tone
a
faint
echo
of
regret
so
i
wanted
to
see
the
expression
of
her
mouth
it
told
me
nothing
i
could
not
get
anything
further
out
of
her
because
the
waiters
came
in
and
out
after
this
rather
frequently
changing
the
courses
and
so
i
did
not
have
any
success
after
lunch
i
suggested
as
it
had
cleared
up
that
we
should
go
at
least
as
far
as
the
parterre
and
sit
under
the
shadow
of
the
terrace
the
flower
beds
are
full
of
beans
now
their
ancient
glories
departed
miss
sharp
followed
my
bath
chair
and
with
extreme
diligence
kept
me
to
the
of
the
first
chapter
for
an
hour
i
watched
her
darling
small
face
whenever
i
could
a
sense
of
peace
was
upon
me
we
were
certainly
on
the
first
rung
of
the
ladder
of
friendship
and
presently
presently
if
only
i
could
keep
from
annoying
her
in
any
way
when
we
had
finished
our
task
she
rose
if
you
do
mind
as
it
is
saturday
i
have
promised
burton
and
she
looked
at
him
seated
on
a
chair
beyond
earshot
enjoying
the
sun
to
do
up
the
accounts
and
prepare
the
cheques
for
you
to
sign
so
i
will
go
in
now
and
begin
i
wanted
to
say
damn
the
accounts
but
i
let
her
go
i
must
play
the
tortoise
in
this
game
not
the
hare
she
smiled
faintly
the
third
smile
as
she
made
me
a
little
bow
and
walked
off
after
a
few
paces
she
came
back
again
may
i
ask
burton
for
the
bread
ticket
i
lent
you
on
thursday
she
said
no
one
can
afford
to
be
generous
with
them
now
can
they
i
was
delighted
at
this
i
would
have
been
delighted
at
anything
which
kept
her
with
me
an
extra
minute
i
watched
her
as
she
disappeared
down
towards
the
reservoirs
with
longing
eyes
then
i
must
have
dozed
for
a
while
because
it
was
a
quarter
to
five
when
i
got
back
to
my
and
when
i
was
safely
in
my
chair
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
and
in
she
came
with
a
in
her
hand
before
i
opened
it
or
even
took
it
up
i
knew
something
had
happened
which
had
changed
her
again
her
manner
had
its
old
icy
respect
as
of
a
person
employed
all
the
friendliness
which
had
been
growing
in
the
last
two
or
three
days
had
completely
departed
i
could
not
imagine
why
she
put
the
open
and
handed
me
a
pen
to
sign
with
and
then
i
signed
the
dozen
that
she
had
filled
in
and
tore
them
off
as
i
did
so
she
was
silent
and
when
i
had
finished
she
took
them
saying
casually
that
she
would
bring
the
corrected
chapter
typed
again
on
tuesday
and
was
now
going
to
catch
her
train
and
before
i
could
reply
she
had
gone
into
the
other
room
a
frightful
sense
of
depression
fell
upon
me
what
could
it
possibly
be
idly
i
picked
up
the
and
absently
fingered
the
leaves
then
my
eye
caught
a
counterfoil
where
i
had
chanced
to
open
it
it
was
not
in
miss
sharp
handwriting
although
this
was
the
house
which
burton
usually
keeps
but
in
my
own
and
there
was
written
just
casually
as
i
scribble
in
my
private
for
suzette
francs
and
the
date
of
last
saturday
and
on
turning
the
page
there
was
the
further
one
of
for
suzette
francs
and
the
date
of
monday
the
irony
of
fate
i
had
picked
this
up
inadvertently
i
suppose
on
these
two
days
instead
of
my
own
x
it
is
quite
useless
for
me
to
comment
upon
the
utterly
annoying
circumstance
of
that
mixup
of
such
things
are
fate
and
fate
i
am
beginning
to
believe
is
nothing
but
a
reflex
of
our
own
actions
if
suzette
had
not
been
my
little
friend
i
should
not
have
given
her
eight
thousand
francs
but
as
she
has
been
and
i
did
i
must
stand
by
the
consequences
after
all
a
man
well
what
is
the
use
of
writing
about
it
i
am
so
utterly
mad
and
resentful
that
i
have
no
words
it
is
sunday
morning
and
this
afternoon
i
shall
hire
the
one
motor
which
can
be
obtained
here
at
a
fabulous
price
and
go
into
paris
there
are
some
books
i
want
to
get
out
of
my
bookcase
and
somehow
i
have
lost
interest
here
but
this
morning
i
shall
go
and
sit
in
the
parish
church
and
hear
i
feel
so
completely
wretched
the
music
may
comfort
me
and
give
me
courage
to
forget
all
about
miss
sharp
and
in
any
case
there
is
a
soothing
atmosphere
in
a
roman
catholic
church
which
is
agreeable
i
love
the
french
people
they
are
a
continual
tonic
if
one
takes
them
rightly
so
filled
with
common
sense
simply
using
sentiment
as
an
ornament
and
a
relaxation
and
never
allowing
it
to
interfere
with
the
practical
necessities
of
life
ignorant
people
say
they
are
hysterical
and
over
passionate
they
are
nothing
of
the
kind
they
believe
in
material
things
and
in
the
where
they
require
a
religion
they
accept
a
comforting
one
and
meanwhile
they
enjoy
whatever
comes
in
their
way
and
get
through
disagreeables
philosophically
la
france
i
am
waiting
for
the
motor
now
and
trying
to
be
mass
did
me
good
i
sat
in
a
corner
and
kept
my
crutch
by
me
the
church
itself
told
me
stories
i
tried
to
see
it
in
louis
xv
time
i
dare
say
it
looked
much
the
same
only
dirtier
and
life
was
made
up
with
etiquette
and
forms
and
ceremonies
more
exasperating
than
anything
now
but
they
were
ahead
of
us
in
manners
and
a
sense
of
beauty
a
little
child
came
and
sat
beside
me
for
about
ten
minutes
and
looked
at
me
and
my
crutch
sympathetically
de
la
i
heard
her
whisper
to
her
mother
the
organ
was
not
bad
and
before
i
came
out
i
felt
calmer
after
all
it
is
absurd
of
miss
sharp
to
be
disgusted
about
suzette
she
must
know
at
nearly
and
living
in
france
that
there
are
suzettes
and
i
am
sure
she
is
not
in
any
way
what
can
have
made
her
so
censorious
if
she
took
a
personal
interest
in
me
it
would
be
different
but
entirely
indifferent
as
she
is
how
can
it
matter
to
her
as
i
write
this
that
hot
sense
of
anger
and
rebellion
arises
in
me
i
have
to
keep
saying
to
myself
that
i
am
in
the
trenches
again
and
must
not
complain
i
make
burton
find
out
if
coralie
is
really
staying
here
and
get
her
to
dine
with
me
coralie
always
pretended
to
have
a
for
me
even
when
most
engaged
elsewhere
sunday
was
a
memorable
day
i
went
through
the
de
on
that
bad
road
because
the
trees
were
so
lovely
and
then
through
the
de
even
in
war
time
this
wonderful
people
can
enjoy
the
open
air
life
i
think
of
henriette
d
angleterre
looking
from
the
terrace
of
her
château
over
the
tree
tops
the
poor
château
not
a
stone
of
which
is
standing
did
she
feel
sentimental
with
her
friend
the
comte
de
guiche
as
i
would
like
to
feel
now
if
i
had
someone
to
be
sentimental
with
alas
there
was
an
ominous
hot
stillness
in
the
air
and
the
sky
beyond
the
eiffel
tower
had
a
heavy
lurid
tone
in
it
when
we
got
across
the
river
into
the
de
it
seemed
as
if
all
paris
was
enjoying
a
holiday
i
told
the
chauffeur
to
go
down
a
side
and
to
go
slowly
and
presently
i
made
him
draw
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
it
was
so
hot
and
i
wanted
to
rest
for
a
little
the
motion
was
jarring
my
leg
i
think
i
must
have
been
half
asleep
when
my
attention
was
caught
by
three
figures
coming
up
another
obliquely
the
tallest
of
them
was
undoubtedly
miss
sharp
but
miss
sharp
as
i
had
never
seen
her
before
and
a
boy
of
thirteen
and
a
girl
of
eleven
were
at
either
side
of
her
the
boy
clinging
on
to
her
arm
he
was
lame
and
seemed
to
be
a
dreadfully
delicate
rickety
person
the
little
girl
was
very
small
and
sickly
looking
too
but
miss
sharp
my
secretary
appeared
blooming
and
young
and
lovely
in
her
inexpensive
foulard
frock
no
glasses
hid
her
blue
eyes
her
hair
was
not
torn
back
and
screwed
into
a
knot
but
might
have
been
dressed
by
alice
maid
and
her
hat
the
simplest
thing
possible
was
most
becoming
with
the
proper
modish
look
refinement
and
perfect
taste
proclaimed
themselves
from
every
inch
of
her
even
if
everything
had
only
cost
a
small
sum
so
that
dowdy
is
for
my
benefit
and
is
not
habitual
to
her
or
is
it
that
she
has
only
one
costume
and
keeps
it
for
sundays
and
days
of
in
spite
of
my
determination
to
put
all
thought
of
her
from
me
a
wild
emotion
arose
a
passionate
longing
to
spring
from
the
car
and
join
her
to
talk
to
her
and
tell
her
how
lovely
i
thought
she
was
looking
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
i
could
see
that
her
face
was
rippling
with
smiles
at
something
the
little
brother
had
said
its
expression
was
gentle
and
sympathetic
and
it
was
obvious
that
fond
affection
held
all
three
the
children
might
have
been
drawn
by
du
maurier
in
punch
long
ago
to
express
a
family
who
were
overbred
race
run
to
seed
expressed
itself
in
every
line
of
them
the
boy
wore
an
eton
jacket
and
collar
and
a
tall
hat
and
it
looked
quite
strange
in
this
place
as
they
got
close
to
me
i
could
hear
him
cough
in
the
hollow
way
which
tells
its
own
story
i
cowered
down
behind
the
hood
of
the
motor
and
they
passed
without
seeing
me
or
perhaps
miss
sharp
did
see
me
but
was
determined
not
to
look
i
felt
utterly
alone
and
deserted
by
all
the
world
and
the
same
nervous
trembling
came
over
me
which
once
before
made
me
suffer
so
and
again
i
was
conscious
that
my
cheek
was
wet
with
a
tear
the
humiliation
of
it
the
disgrace
of
such
feebleness
when
they
had
gone
by
i
started
forward
again
to
watch
them
i
could
hear
the
little
girl
cry
oh
look
alathea
as
she
pointed
to
the
sky
and
then
all
three
began
to
quicken
their
pace
down
another
in
the
direction
of
auteuil
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
then
still
quivering
with
emotion
i
too
glanced
heavenward
ye
gods
what
a
storm
was
coming
on
where
were
they
going
there
into
the
deep
wood
it
was
a
good
mile
or
two
from
the
auteuil
gate
they
would
be
soaked
to
the
skin
when
the
rain
did
commence
to
fall
and
there
was
a
thunder
storm
beginning
also
were
they
quite
safe
all
these
thoughts
tormented
me
and
i
gave
the
chauffeur
orders
to
take
a
road
i
thought
might
cut
across
the
path
they
had
followed
and
when
we
reached
the
spot
i
made
him
wait
the
livid
lightning
rent
the
sky
and
the
thunder
roared
like
guns
and
the
few
people
in
sight
rushed
in
a
hopeless
search
for
shelter
far
greater
fear
on
their
faces
than
they
show
at
german
bombs
my
chauffeur
complained
audibly
as
he
got
down
to
shut
the
car
did
monsieur
wish
to
be
struck
by
lightning
he
demanded
very
enraged
still
i
waited
but
no
sharp
family
appeared
and
at
last
i
knew
i
had
missed
them
somehow
a
very
easy
thing
in
that
wood
so
i
told
him
he
could
drive
like
hell
to
my
in
the
des
etats
and
off
we
rushed
in
the
now
torrential
rain
it
was
one
of
the
worst
thunder
storms
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
i
was
horribly
worried
as
to
what
could
have
happened
to
that
little
party
for
that
where
i
had
seen
them
was
in
the
very
middle
of
the
and
far
from
any
gate
or
shelter
they
must
have
got
soaking
wet
if
nothing
worse
had
happened
to
them
and
how
could
i
hear
anything
about
them
what
should
i
do
was
the
duchesse
in
paris
could
i
find
the
address
possibly
from
her
but
would
she
be
likely
to
know
it
just
because
miss
sharp
alathea
what
a
lovely
greek
name
brought
bandages
to
the
hospital
however
this
was
worth
trying
and
i
could
hardly
wait
to
get
out
of
the
motor
and
get
to
the
telephone
the
came
out
with
an
umbrella
in
great
concern
and
took
me
up
in
the
lift
herself
and
there
was
burton
waiting
for
me
he
had
come
in
by
train
to
take
me
back
safely
later
on
how
i
cursed
my
folly
in
not
having
asked
miss
sharp
herself
for
her
address
could
burton
possibly
know
it
how
silly
of
me
not
to
have
thought
of
that
before
burton
i
saw
miss
sharp
and
her
family
in
the
do
you
know
their
address
by
chance
i
want
to
ring
up
and
find
out
if
they
got
home
all
right
burton
could
see
my
anxiety
and
actually
hurried
in
his
reply
they
live
in
auteuil
sir
nicholas
but
i
ca
exactly
say
where
the
young
lady
never
seems
very
particular
to
give
me
the
address
she
said
i
should
not
be
needing
it
and
that
they
were
likely
to
move
get
on
to
the
duchesse
de
as
quickly
as
you
can
burton
did
so
at
once
but
it
seemed
a
long
time
no
madame
la
duchesse
was
down
at
hautevine
taking
some
fresh
convalescents
and
would
not
return
until
the
middle
of
the
week
if
then
i
nearly
swore
aloud
are
they
talking
from
the
lodge
or
the
hotel
burton
ask
at
both
if
they
know
the
address
of
a
miss
sharp
who
brings
bandages
to
the
hospital
of
course
by
this
time
the
connection
had
been
cut
off
and
it
took
quite
ten
minutes
to
get
on
again
and
by
that
time
i
could
have
yelled
aloud
with
the
feverish
fret
of
it
all
and
the
pain
no
one
knew
anything
of
a
mees
shearp
mees
shearp
many
ladies
brought
bandages
i
mastered
myself
as
well
as
i
could
and
got
into
my
chair
and
in
a
few
moments
burton
brought
me
a
brandy
and
soda
and
put
it
into
my
hand
it
wo
be
cleared
up
enough
to
go
back
to
versailles
before
dinner
sir
nicholas
he
said
and
coughed
i
was
just
thinking
maybe
be
liking
some
friends
to
come
in
and
dine
pierre
can
get
something
in
from
the
restaurant
if
you
feel
inclined
the
cough
meant
that
burton
knows
i
am
dreadfully
upset
and
that
under
the
circumstances
anything
to
distract
me
is
the
lesser
of
two
evils
ask
whom
you
please
i
answered
and
drank
the
brandy
and
soda
down
presently
after
half
an
hour
burton
came
back
to
me
beaming
i
had
been
sitting
in
my
chair
too
exhausted
even
to
feel
pain
meanwhile
he
had
telephoned
everywhere
and
no
one
was
in
town
but
at
last
at
the
ritz
where
the
knows
all
my
friends
he
had
been
informed
that
bruce
nina
had
arrived
the
night
before
alone
he
had
got
connected
up
at
her
and
she
would
be
at
eight
very
pleased
to
dine
nina
a
pleasant
thrill
ran
through
me
nina
and
without
jim
the
wood
fire
was
burning
brightly
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
when
nina
fresh
as
a
rose
came
in
nicholas
she
cried
delightedly
and
held
out
both
hands
nina
this
is
a
pleasure
you
old
dear
now
let
me
look
at
you
and
see
what
marriage
has
done
nina
drew
back
and
laughed
everything
nicholas
she
said
a
feeling
of
envy
came
over
me
jim
ankle
is
stiff
for
life
it
seems
hard
that
an
eye
can
make
such
a
difference
nina
is
in
love
with
jim
but
no
woman
can
be
in
love
with
me
her
face
is
much
softer
she
is
more
attractive
altogether
you
look
splendid
nina
i
told
her
i
want
to
hear
all
about
it
so
you
shall
when
we
have
finished
dinner
and
she
handed
me
my
crutch
as
i
got
up
from
my
chair
pierre
had
secured
some
quite
respectable
food
and
during
dinner
and
afterwards
when
we
were
cosily
smoking
our
cigarettes
in
the
nina
gave
me
all
the
news
of
our
friends
at
every
single
one
of
them
was
still
working
she
said
it
is
marvelous
how
they
have
stuck
it
i
responded
oh
no
not
at
all
nina
answered
we
as
a
nation
are
people
of
habit
the
war
is
a
habit
to
us
now
heaps
of
us
work
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
patriotism
others
because
they
are
afraid
what
would
be
said
of
them
if
they
did
not
others
because
they
are
thankful
to
have
some
steady
job
to
get
off
their
superfluous
energy
on
so
it
ends
by
everyone
being
roped
in
and
you
ca
think
nicholas
how
divine
it
is
to
get
home
after
long
hours
of
drudgery
to
find
the
person
you
love
waiting
for
you
and
to
know
you
are
going
to
have
all
the
rest
of
the
time
together
until
next
day
no
i
ca
imagine
the
bliss
of
that
nina
she
looked
at
me
suddenly
well
why
do
you
marry
then
dear
boy
i
would
if
i
thought
i
could
secure
bliss
but
you
forget
it
would
be
from
pity
and
not
love
that
a
woman
would
be
kind
to
me
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
that
nicholas
and
she
looked
at
me
searchingly
you
are
changed
since
last
time
you
are
not
so
bitter
and
sardonic
and
you
always
have
that
oh
you
know
what
elinor
glyn
writes
of
in
her
books
that
it
some
kind
of
attraction
that
has
no
name
but
i
am
sure
has
a
lot
to
do
with
love
so
you
think
i
have
got
nina
yes
your
clothes
fit
so
well
and
you
say
rather
whimsical
things
yes
decidedly
nicholas
now
that
you
are
not
so
bitter
i
am
sure
what
a
pity
you
did
not
find
that
out
before
you
took
jim
nina
oh
jim
that
is
different
you
have
much
more
brain
than
jim
and
would
not
have
been
nearly
so
easy
to
live
with
is
it
going
well
nina
yes
perfectly
that
is
why
i
came
to
paris
alone
i
knew
it
would
be
good
for
him
besides
i
wanted
a
rest
nicholas
i
thought
you
had
married
for
a
rest
well
if
a
man
love
is
what
you
really
want
and
not
his
just
you
you
have
to
use
your
wits
it
ca
be
a
rest
not
if
he
has
made
you
care
when
i
was
just
tossing
up
between
jim
and
rochester
then
i
had
not
to
bother
about
how
i
behaved
to
them
you
see
i
was
the
as
yet
unattained
desired
thing
but
having
accepted
one
of
them
he
has
time
to
think
of
things
not
having
to
fight
to
get
me
and
so
i
have
to
keep
him
thinking
of
things
which
have
still
speculation
in
them
do
you
see
you
have
to
keep
the
hunting
instinct
alive
in
fact
yes
you
do
think
it
would
be
possible
to
find
someone
who
was
just
mate
so
that
no
game
of
any
sort
would
be
necessary
she
thought
hard
for
a
moment
that
of
course
would
be
heaven
then
she
sighed
i
am
afraid
it
is
no
use
in
hoping
for
that
nicholas
someone
who
would
understand
so
well
that
silence
was
eloquent
someone
who
would
read
books
with
one
and
think
thoughts
with
one
someone
who
would
lie
in
one
arms
and
respond
to
caresses
and
not
be
counting
the
dollars
or
doing
her
knitting
someone
who
was
tender
and
kind
and
true
oh
nina
i
suppose
my
voice
had
taken
on
a
tone
of
emotion
i
was
thinking
of
miss
sharp
alathea
that
shall
be
her
name
always
for
me
now
nicholas
nina
exclaimed
my
dear
boy
of
course
you
are
in
love
and
if
so
instantly
i
became
of
more
value
to
nina
she
realized
that
she
had
lost
me
and
that
some
other
woman
drew
me
and
not
herself
and
although
nina
is
the
best
sort
in
the
world
and
more
or
less
really
in
love
with
jim
i
knew
that
a
new
note
could
grow
in
our
friendship
if
i
wished
to
encourage
it
nina
fighting
instinct
had
been
aroused
to
try
to
get
me
back
who
with
she
demanded
laconically
with
a
dream
nonsense
you
are
much
too
cynical
is
it
anyone
i
know
i
should
not
think
so
she
has
not
materialised
yet
this
is
frightfully
interesting
my
dear
old
boy
so
you
think
i
have
a
chance
then
certainly
when
you
are
all
finished
my
new
eye
is
to
be
in
before
christmas
and
my
new
leg
after
the
new
year
and
my
shoulder
gets
straighter
every
day
nina
laughed
real
love
would
be
i
suppose
if
you
could
make
her
adore
you
before
you
looked
any
handsomer
and
this
sentence
of
nina
rang
in
my
ears
long
after
she
had
gone
and
often
in
the
night
i
could
not
sleep
i
felt
something
had
happened
and
that
fate
might
be
going
to
take
miss
sharp
alathea
from
me
and
then
before
morning
in
fretful
dreams
i
seemed
to
be
obsessed
by
the
cooing
of
love
words
between
a
woman
and
a
child
xi
monday
was
a
perfectly
impossible
day
i
spent
all
the
morning
before
i
returned
to
versailles
in
writing
to
maurice
telling
him
he
must
find
out
all
about
miss
sharp
alathea
i
felt
if
i
told
him
her
christian
name
it
would
be
a
clue
and
yet
even
to
assist
in
that
which
was
at
the
moment
my
heart
desire
i
could
not
overcome
my
personal
dislike
to
pronounce
it
to
maurice
it
seemed
as
something
sacred
to
me
alone
which
makes
me
reflect
upon
how
egotistical
we
all
are
and
how
we
would
all
rather
fail
in
attaining
what
is
our
greatest
wish
than
not
to
be
able
to
express
our
own
personality
nina
had
suggested
before
she
left
that
i
should
stay
in
paris
and
come
to
the
theatre
with
her
we
could
have
some
delicious
old
times
nicholas
now
that
you
are
so
much
better
once
this
would
have
thrilled
me
only
last
spring
but
now
the
contrariness
in
me
made
me
say
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
i
returned
immediately
to
versailles
i
believe
i
should
have
answered
like
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
miss
sharp
alathea
in
the
case
just
because
i
now
knew
nina
really
wanted
me
to
stay
every
man
is
like
that
more
or
less
if
only
women
knew
the
whole
sex
relation
is
one
of
fence
until
the
object
has
been
secured
and
then
emotion
dies
out
altogether
or
is
revived
in
one
or
the
other
but
very
seldom
in
both
love
real
love
is
beyond
all
this
i
suppose
and
does
not
depend
upon
whether
or
no
the
other
person
excites
one
desire
for
conquest
love
must
be
wonderful
i
believe
alathea
i
have
actually
written
it
naturally
this
time
could
love
i
never
used
to
think
i
could
at
the
best
of
moments
i
have
analysed
my
emotions
and
stood
aside
as
it
were
and
measured
just
how
much
things
were
meaning
to
me
but
when
i
think
of
that
scrap
of
a
girl
with
her
elusive
ways
her
pride
her
refinement
even
her
little
red
hands
i
have
a
longing
a
passionate
longing
to
hold
her
always
near
me
to
know
that
she
is
mine
that
for
the
rest
of
time
i
should
be
with
her
learning
from
her
high
thoughts
comforted
by
her
strength
of
character
believing
in
her
respecting
her
yes
that
is
it
how
few
women
one
meets
with
attractions
that
one
really
one
respects
many
elderly
ones
of
course
and
abstract
splendid
creatures
but
bringing
it
down
to
concrete
facts
how
few
are
the
women
who
have
drawn
admiration
or
excited
one
desire
who
at
the
same
time
one
reverenced
love
must
mean
reverence
that
is
it
and
what
is
reverence
the
soul
acknowledgment
of
the
purity
of
another
and
purity
in
this
sense
means
truth
and
honor
and
lofty
aims
not
the
denial
of
all
passion
or
the
practice
of
asceticism
i
utterly
reverence
alathea
and
yet
i
am
sure
with
that
mouth
if
she
loved
me
she
would
be
anything
but
cold
how
on
god
earth
can
i
make
her
love
me
i
went
back
to
versailles
after
luncheon
having
had
to
see
the
specialist
about
my
eye
he
thinks
the
socket
is
so
marvelously
healed
lately
that
i
could
have
the
glass
one
in
now
much
sooner
than
christmas
i
wonder
if
some
self
confidence
will
return
when
i
can
feel
people
are
not
revolted
when
looking
at
me
that
again
is
of
course
no
one
is
revolted
they
feel
pity
and
that
is
perhaps
worse
when
i
get
my
leg
too
shall
i
have
the
nerve
to
make
love
to
alathea
and
use
all
the
arts
which
used
to
be
so
successful
in
the
old
days
i
believe
if
i
were
back
in
i
should
still
be
as
nervous
as
a
cat
when
with
her
is
this
one
of
the
symptoms
of
love
again
george
harcourt
has
many
maxims
upon
the
subject
of
love
one
is
that
a
frenchman
thinks
most
of
the
methods
of
love
an
englishman
more
of
the
sensations
of
love
and
an
austrian
of
the
emotions
of
love
i
wonder
if
this
is
true
he
also
says
that
a
woman
does
not
really
appreciate
a
man
who
reverences
her
sex
in
the
abstract
and
is
chivalrous
about
all
women
she
rather
thinks
him
a
simpleton
what
she
does
appreciate
is
a
man
who
holds
cynical
views
about
the
female
sex
in
general
and
shows
reverence
and
chivalry
towards
herself
in
particular
this
i
feel
is
probably
the
truth
i
did
not
expect
to
hear
anything
of
alathea
on
the
monday
she
was
not
due
until
tuesday
at
eleven
but
when
i
came
in
from
my
sunset
on
the
terrace
i
found
two
telegrams
all
the
first
one
said
was
extremely
sorry
will
be
unable
to
come
brother
seriously
a
sharp
and
no
address
so
i
could
not
send
sympathy
or
even
offer
any
help
i
could
have
sworn
aloud
the
storm
had
wrecked
its
vengeance
on
someone
then
and
the
poor
little
chap
had
probably
taken
cold
if
i
could
only
be
of
some
use
to
them
perhaps
getting
the
best
doctor
is
out
of
their
reach
i
was
full
of
turmoil
while
i
tore
open
the
other
blue
paper
this
was
from
suzette
i
come
this
evening
at
eight
it
was
nearly
seven
now
so
i
could
not
put
her
off
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
wanted
to
suzette
is
a
human
being
and
kindly
and
her
heart
is
warm
when
burton
was
dressing
me
i
told
him
of
miss
sharp
telegram
the
poor
young
lady
he
said
burton
always
speaks
of
her
as
the
young
lady
he
never
makes
a
mistake
about
class
suzette
for
him
is
and
he
speaks
of
her
as
a
mother
might
about
her
boy
noisy
tiresome
rackety
school
friends
necessary
evils
to
be
put
up
with
for
the
boy
sake
the
fluffies
he
announces
always
by
their
full
titles
madame
la
comtesse
with
a
face
of
stone
nina
and
the
one
or
two
other
englishwomen
he
is
politely
respectful
to
but
to
miss
sharp
he
is
absolutely
reverential
she
might
be
a
queen
i
expect
the
poor
little
fellow
got
wet
through
yesterday
i
hazarded
he
that
delicate
burton
remarked
so
burton
knows
something
more
about
the
family
than
i
do
after
all
how
did
you
know
he
was
delicate
burton
or
even
that
miss
sharp
had
a
brother
i
do
exactly
know
sir
nicholas
it
come
out
from
one
time
to
another
the
young
lady
do
talk
how
did
you
guess
then
i
seen
her
anxious
when
i
brought
in
her
tray
sometimes
and
once
i
ventured
to
say
to
her
beg
pardon
miss
but
can
i
do
anything
for
you
and
she
took
off
her
glasses
sudden
like
and
thanked
me
and
said
it
was
her
little
brother
she
was
worrying
about
and
you
may
believe
me
or
not
as
you
like
sir
nicholas
but
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
i
wonder
if
burton
guessed
the
deep
emotion
he
was
causing
me
my
little
darling
with
her
beautiful
blue
eyes
full
of
tears
and
i
impotent
to
comfort
or
help
her
yes
yes
i
said
she
told
me
then
that
he
been
delicate
since
birth
and
she
feared
the
winter
in
paris
for
him
i
do
believe
sir
it
that
she
works
so
hard
for
to
get
him
away
south
burton
what
the
devil
can
we
do
about
it
i
do
very
well
know
sir
nicholas
many
the
time
i
badly
wanted
to
offer
her
the
peaches
and
grapes
and
other
things
to
take
back
to
him
but
of
course
i
know
my
place
better
than
to
insult
a
lady
like
as
if
she
were
of
another
class
you
see
sir
she
have
grabbed
then
but
bein
as
she
is
she
have
been
bound
to
refuse
them
and
it
might
have
tempted
her
for
him
and
made
things
awkward
burton
not
only
knows
the
world
but
has
tact
he
went
on
now
once
started
i
saw
her
outside
a
wine
shop
once
when
i
got
off
the
tram
at
auteuil
she
was
looking
at
the
bottles
of
port
and
i
made
so
as
to
pass
and
her
not
see
me
but
she
turned
and
said
friendly
like
do
you
suppose
this
shop
would
keep
really
good
port
i
said
as
how
i
would
go
in
and
see
and
she
came
with
me
they
had
some
fairly
decent
though
too
young
sir
nicholas
and
it
was
francs
the
bottle
i
saw
she
had
not
an
idea
it
would
be
as
much
as
that
her
face
fell
do
you
know
sir
i
could
see
she
had
that
much
with
her
it
was
the
day
before
she
paid
you
see
her
colour
came
and
went
then
she
said
wonder
burton
if
you
could
oblige
me
with
paying
the
ten
extra
francs
until
i
must
have
the
best
you
may
believe
me
sir
nicholas
i
got
out
my
purse
quick
enough
and
then
she
thanked
me
so
sweet
like
doctor
has
ordered
it
for
my
mother
burton
she
said
of
course
she
could
drink
any
but
the
best
who
on
earth
can
she
be
burton
it
does
worry
me
ca
you
possibly
find
out
i
would
so
like
to
help
them
i
feel
that
sir
but
here
the
way
i
figure
it
when
gentry
lives
in
foreign
towns
and
do
seem
anxious
for
you
to
know
their
address
it
do
seem
right
like
to
pry
into
it
burton
you
dear
old
brick
well
supposing
we
do
try
to
pry
but
just
try
how
we
can
possibly
help
her
you
could
certainly
be
sympathetic
about
the
brother
since
she
has
spoken
to
you
and
surely
something
can
be
done
i
saw
her
at
the
duchesse
you
know
do
you
suppose
she
knows
her
i
do
sir
nicholas
i
never
meant
to
speak
of
it
but
one
day
her
grace
came
to
see
you
and
you
were
out
and
she
caught
sight
of
miss
sharp
through
the
half
open
door
and
she
jumped
like
a
cat
her
grace
did
she
cried
out
or
some
name
like
that
and
miss
sharp
started
up
and
went
down
the
stairs
with
her
she
seemed
to
be
kind
of
explaining
and
i
am
not
sure
that
her
grace
was
too
pleased
burton
thinks
all
duchesses
should
be
called
grace
whether
they
are
french
or
english
then
we
should
certainly
be
able
to
find
out
from
the
duchesse
well
i
would
not
be
so
sure
of
that
sir
nicholas
you
see
the
duchesse
is
a
very
kind
lady
but
she
is
a
lady
of
the
world
and
she
may
have
her
reasons
then
what
do
you
suggest
burton
why
i
hardly
know
perhaps
to
wait
and
see
sir
nicholas
masterly
inactivity
it
might
be
that
i
could
do
a
bit
of
finding
out
if
i
felt
sure
no
harm
could
come
of
it
i
was
not
quite
certain
what
burton
meant
by
this
what
possible
harm
could
come
of
it
find
out
all
you
can
and
let
me
know
suzette
opened
the
door
and
came
in
just
as
i
finished
dressing
burton
left
the
she
was
pouting
so
the
book
is
not
completed
nicholas
and
the
english
mees
comes
three
times
a
week
yes
does
that
upset
you
i
should
say
may
i
not
have
a
secretary
you
will
be
objecting
to
my
aunt
coming
to
stay
with
me
or
my
dining
with
my
friends
next
i
was
angry
no
not
that
they
are
not
for
me
those
but
a
secretary
a
for
why
do
you
want
us
two
you
good
lord
do
you
think
suzette
dieu
i
now
became
very
angry
my
secretary
is
here
to
type
my
book
let
us
understand
one
another
quite
you
have
overstepped
the
mark
this
time
suzette
and
there
must
be
an
end
name
whatever
sum
you
want
me
to
settle
on
you
and
then
i
do
ever
wish
to
see
you
again
she
burst
into
frantic
weeping
she
had
meant
nothing
she
was
jealous
she
loved
me
even
going
to
the
sea
could
do
nothing
for
her
i
was
her
her
sun
moon
and
stars
of
what
matter
a
leg
or
an
eye
i
was
her
life
her
nonsense
suzette
you
have
told
me
often
it
was
only
because
i
was
very
rich
now
be
sensible
these
things
have
to
have
an
end
some
day
i
shall
be
going
back
to
england
soon
so
just
let
me
make
you
comfortable
and
happy
and
let
us
part
friends
she
still
stormed
and
raged
was
someone
else
it
was
the
mees
i
had
been
different
ever
since
she
had
come
to
the
flat
she
suzette
would
be
revenged
she
would
kill
her
then
i
flew
into
a
rage
and
dominated
her
and
when
i
had
her
thoroughly
frightened
i
appealed
to
the
best
in
her
and
when
she
was
sobbing
quietly
burton
came
in
to
say
that
dinner
was
ready
his
face
was
eloquent
do
let
the
waiters
see
you
like
that
i
said
suzette
rushed
to
the
glass
and
looked
at
herself
and
then
began
opening
her
gold
chain
bag
to
get
out
her
powder
and
lip
grease
i
went
on
into
the
salon
and
left
her
what
an
irony
everything
is
when
i
was
yearning
for
tenderness
and
love
even
suzette
i
was
unable
to
touch
her
and
now
because
i
am
quite
indifferent
both
she
and
nina
in
their
separate
ways
have
begun
to
find
me
attractive
so
there
is
nothing
in
it
really
it
is
only
as
to
whether
or
no
you
arouse
the
hunting
instinct
suzette
wore
an
air
of
deep
pathos
during
our
repast
she
had
put
some
blue
round
her
eyes
to
heighten
the
effect
of
the
red
of
the
real
tears
and
she
appeared
very
pretty
and
gentle
it
had
not
the
slightest
effect
upon
me
i
found
myself
looking
on
like
a
third
person
the
mole
with
its
three
black
hairs
seemed
to
be
the
only
salient
point
about
her
poor
little
suzette
how
glad
i
felt
that
i
had
never
even
pretended
a
scrap
of
love
for
her
that
astonishing
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
which
so
many
of
these
women
possess
showed
itself
as
the
evening
wore
on
finding
the
situation
hopeless
suzette
accepted
it
curbed
the
real
emotion
in
herself
and
played
the
game
she
tried
to
amuse
me
and
then
we
discussed
plans
for
her
future
a
villa
at
monte
carlo
she
decided
at
last
a
of
a
place
which
she
knew
of
and
when
we
parted
at
about
eleven
everything
was
arranged
satisfactorily
then
she
said
to
me
she
would
go
back
to
paris
by
the
last
train
suzette
and
i
bent
down
and
kissed
her
forehead
you
have
been
the
jolliest
little
pal
possible
and
remember
that
i
have
appreciated
it
and
you
will
always
have
a
real
friend
in
me
she
burst
into
tears
once
more
real
tears
bien
she
whispered
i
shall
go
to
deauville
we
wrung
hands
and
she
went
to
the
door
but
there
she
turned
and
some
of
her
old
fire
came
back
to
her
pah
these
english
meeses
thin
stiff
thou
wilt
yet
regret
thy
suzette
nicholas
and
with
this
she
left
me
so
that
episode
in
my
life
is
ended
and
i
shall
never
repeat
the
experiment
but
are
not
women
the
most
amazing
creatures
you
adore
them
and
give
them
abject
devotion
and
they
treat
you
as
dirt
nothing
can
be
so
cruel
as
the
tenderest
hearted
woman
is
to
a
male
slave
another
woman
appears
upon
the
scene
then
the
first
one
begins
to
treat
you
with
some
respect
you
grow
masterful
love
is
aroused
in
her
you
become
indifferent
and
very
often
it
is
she
who
then
turns
into
the
slave
the
worst
of
it
is
that
when
you
really
care
you
are
incapable
of
playing
a
game
successfully
the
subconscious
mind
that
it
is
merely
pretense
and
so
she
remains
a
it
is
only
when
she
herself
has
ceased
to
put
forth
sufficient
attraction
to
keep
you
and
you
are
growing
numb
that
you
can
win
out
and
find
your
again
there
was
a
moment
when
i
was
very
angry
with
suzette
and
almost
shaking
her
when
i
saw
in
her
eyes
the
first
look
of
real
passionate
affection
are
there
any
women
in
the
world
who
could
be
mates
who
would
be
able
to
love
one
and
hold
one
at
the
same
time
satisfying
one
mind
and
one
spirit
and
one
body
could
alathea
i
do
not
know
i
had
got
this
far
in
my
speculations
when
a
note
was
brought
to
me
by
a
smart
french
maid
it
was
now
past
eleven
at
night
it
was
from
coralie
i
am
here
i
am
rather
in
a
difficulty
can
i
come
to
your
i
scribbled
of
course
and
in
a
moment
she
came
seductive
and
distressful
duquesnois
had
been
recalled
to
the
front
suddenly
her
husband
would
be
back
on
the
morrow
might
she
stay
and
have
some
galmier
water
with
me
could
we
ring
the
bell
and
order
it
so
that
the
waiter
might
see
her
there
because
if
the
husband
asked
anything
he
could
be
sure
it
was
only
the
much
wounded
englishman
and
he
would
not
mind
i
was
sympathetic
the
galmier
came
coralie
did
not
seem
in
a
hurry
to
drink
it
she
sat
by
the
fire
and
talked
and
looked
at
me
with
her
rather
small
expressive
eyes
and
suddenly
i
realized
that
it
was
not
to
save
any
situation
that
even
a
complacent
and
might
object
to
but
just
to
talk
to
me
alone
she
put
forth
every
charm
she
possessed
for
half
an
hour
i
led
her
on
watching
each
move
with
interest
and
playing
right
cards
in
return
coralie
is
very
well
born
and
never
could
be
vulgar
or
blatant
so
it
was
all
entertaining
for
me
this
is
the
first
time
she
has
had
the
chance
of
being
quite
alone
we
fenced
i
showed
enough
not
to
discourage
her
too
soon
and
then
i
allowed
myself
to
be
natural
which
was
being
completely
indifferent
and
it
worked
its
usual
charm
coralie
grew
restless
she
got
up
from
the
sofa
she
stood
by
the
fire
she
came
at
last
quite
close
up
to
my
chair
what
is
there
about
you
nicholas
she
cooed
which
makes
one
forget
that
you
are
wounded
when
i
saw
you
even
in
the
with
that
i
felt
that
she
looked
down
with
a
sigh
how
hard
upon
duquesnois
coralie
a
whole
man
i
have
tired
of
him
he
loves
me
too
much
the
affair
has
become
tame
and
i
am
wild
is
that
it
a
savage
yes
one
feels
that
you
would
break
one
bones
if
you
were
angry
and
would
mock
most
of
the
time
but
if
you
loved
dieu
it
would
be
worth
while
you
have
had
immense
experience
of
love
coralie
have
you
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
am
not
sure
that
it
has
been
love
neither
am
i
they
say
that
you
have
given
millions
to
the
little
suzette
la
blonde
and
that
you
are
crazy
about
her
nicholas
did
i
see
her
on
the
stairs
just
now
i
frowned
she
saw
in
a
moment
it
was
not
the
right
line
for
that
it
is
nothing
nicholas
they
are
very
attractive
those
ladies
one
understands
but
your
book
and
your
secretary
i
lit
a
cigarette
with
supreme
calm
and
did
not
answer
so
that
she
was
obliged
to
go
on
her
face
is
pretty
in
spite
of
those
glasses
nicholas
and
one
saw
that
she
walked
well
as
she
went
on
may
not
a
secretary
have
a
decent
appearance
then
when
they
have
they
do
not
remain
secretaries
long
you
had
better
ask
miss
sharp
if
she
means
to
stay
when
next
you
chance
upon
her
then
i
do
exchange
much
conversation
with
her
myself
there
is
no
exact
english
word
which
would
describe
coralie
face
she
was
longing
to
believe
me
but
felt
she
could
not
quite
she
knew
it
was
foolish
to
bait
me
and
yet
the
female
in
her
was
too
strong
for
any
common
sense
to
win
her
personality
had
to
express
herself
just
as
strongly
about
her
jealousy
of
my
secretary
as
mine
had
to
express
itself
about
not
telling
maurice
alathea
name
in
both
cases
we
cut
off
our
noses
to
spite
our
faces
i
was
aware
of
my
folly
i
do
not
know
if
coralie
was
aware
of
hers
her
exasperation
so
increased
in
a
few
moments
that
she
could
not
control
herself
and
she
spoke
right
out
when
we
have
all
been
so
kind
to
you
nicholas
it
is
too
bad
for
you
to
waste
your
time
upon
that
i
became
stern
then
as
i
had
earlier
become
with
suzette
and
made
coralie
understand
that
i
would
have
no
interference
from
anyone
i
frightened
her
and
presently
she
left
me
more
attracted
than
she
has
ever
been
as
i
said
before
women
are
amazing
creatures
xii
on
wednesday
morning
i
received
a
reply
from
maurice
at
deauville
he
hastened
to
answer
he
said
he
had
heard
of
miss
sharp
through
a
man
in
the
american
red
cross
where
miss
sharp
had
been
employed
he
knew
nothing
more
about
her
he
had
seen
her
once
when
he
was
interviewing
her
and
miss
whatever
the
other
woman
name
was
he
had
forgotten
now
and
he
had
thought
her
suitable
and
plain
and
capable
that
is
all
i
had
tried
to
word
my
letter
not
to
give
the
impression
of
peculiar
interest
but
no
doubt
coralie
who
had
returned
to
the
band
on
monday
had
given
him
her
view
of
the
case
for
he
added
that
these
people
were
often
designing
although
they
looked
simple
and
in
my
loneliness
he
felt
sure
i
would
be
happier
and
better
at
the
sea
with
my
friends
i
would
have
been
angry
only
there
was
something
humorous
in
the
way
everyone
seems
to
think
i
am
incapable
of
managing
my
own
affairs
what
is
it
they
all
want
of
me
not
that
i
should
be
happy
in
my
own
way
but
that
i
should
contribute
to
their
happiness
they
want
to
participate
in
what
my
money
is
able
to
procure
and
they
do
not
want
interference
from
outside
every
one
of
my
friends
and
relations
would
be
hostile
if
i
were
to
announce
that
i
was
in
love
with
miss
sharp
and
wanted
to
marry
her
even
though
it
was
proved
to
them
that
she
was
pretty
a
perfect
lady
intelligent
virtuous
clever
she
is
not
of
their
set
and
might
and
probably
would
be
a
stumbling
block
in
their
path
when
they
wished
to
make
use
of
me
so
she
would
be
taboo
none
of
them
would
put
it
in
that
way
of
course
their
opposition
would
be
and
they
might
even
think
they
were
sincere
because
they
were
thinking
of
happiness
burton
is
the
only
person
whose
sympathy
i
could
count
upon
how
about
the
duchesse
that
is
the
deepest
mystery
of
all
i
must
find
out
from
burton
what
was
the
date
about
when
she
came
to
my
and
found
alathea
was
it
before
that
time
when
she
asked
me
if
i
were
in
love
and
i
saw
that
dear
little
figure
in
the
passage
could
she
have
been
thinking
of
her
by
thursday
when
there
was
no
further
news
i
began
to
feel
so
restless
that
i
determined
to
go
back
to
paris
the
following
week
it
was
all
very
well
to
be
out
in
the
at
versailles
with
a
mind
at
ease
but
it
feels
too
far
away
when
i
am
so
troubled
i
sent
burton
in
on
friday
to
auteuil
just
walk
about
near
the
wine
shop
burton
and
try
to
find
out
by
every
clue
your
not
unintelligent
old
pate
can
invent
where
miss
sharp
lives
and
what
is
happening
then
go
to
the
hotel
de
courville
and
chat
with
the
concierge
or
whatever
you
think
best
i
simply
ca
stand
hearing
nothing
burton
pulled
in
his
lips
very
good
sir
nicholas
i
tried
to
correct
my
book
in
the
afternoon
i
really
am
trying
to
do
the
things
i
feel
she
thinks
would
improve
my
character
but
i
am
one
gnawing
ache
for
news
underneath
is
the
fear
that
some
complication
may
occur
which
will
prevent
her
returning
to
me
i
find
myself
listening
to
every
footstep
in
the
passage
in
case
it
might
be
a
telegram
so
of
course
quite
a
number
of
messages
and
things
were
bound
to
come
from
utterly
uninteresting
sources
to
fill
me
with
hope
and
then
disappoint
me
it
is
always
like
that
i
really
was
wild
on
friday
afternoon
and
if
george
harcourt
had
not
turned
up
he
is
at
the
trianon
palace
now
with
the
supreme
war
council
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
with
myself
lots
of
those
fellows
would
come
and
dine
with
me
if
i
wanted
them
some
are
even
old
pals
but
i
am
out
of
tune
with
my
kind
george
was
very
amusing
my
dear
boy
he
said
violetta
is
upsetting
all
my
calculations
she
has
refused
everything
i
have
offered
her
but
i
fear
she
is
beginning
to
show
me
too
much
devotion
this
seemed
a
great
calamity
to
him
it
is
terribly
dangerous
that
nicholas
because
you
know
my
dear
boy
when
a
woman
shows
absolute
devotion
a
man
is
irresistibly
impelled
to
offer
her
a
back
seat
it
is
when
she
appeals
to
his
senses
shows
him
caprice
and
remains
an
insecure
possession
that
he
will
offer
her
the
place
his
mother
held
of
highest
honour
george
you
impossible
cynic
not
at
all
i
am
merely
a
student
of
human
instincts
and
characteristics
half
a
cynic
is
a
poor
creature
a
complete
one
has
almost
reached
the
mercy
and
tolerance
of
christ
this
was
quite
a
new
view
of
the
subject
he
went
on
you
see
when
men
philosophize
about
women
they
are
generally
unjust
taking
the
subject
from
the
standpoint
that
whatever
frailties
they
have
the
male
is
at
all
events
exempt
from
them
now
that
is
nonsense
neither
sex
is
exempt
and
neither
sex
as
a
rule
will
contemplate
or
admit
its
for
instance
the
sense
of
abstract
truth
in
the
noblest
woman
never
prevents
her
lying
her
lover
or
her
child
yet
she
thinks
herself
quite
honest
in
the
noblest
man
the
sense
is
so
strong
that
it
enables
him
to
make
only
the
one
exception
that
of
invariably
lying
the
woman
i
laughed
he
puffed
one
of
my
cigars
women
have
no
natural
sense
of
truth
they
only
rise
to
it
through
sublime
effort
and
men
it
is
ingrained
in
them
they
only
sink
from
it
to
cover
their
natural
instincts
of
infidelity
his
voice
was
contemplative
now
how
we
lie
to
the
little
darlings
nicholas
how
we
tell
them
we
have
no
time
to
write
when
of
course
we
have
always
time
if
we
really
want
to
we
never
are
at
a
loss
for
the
moments
before
the
creatures
are
a
secure
possession
the
whole
thing
gets
back
to
the
hunting
instinct
my
dear
george
i
ca
see
that
one
can
be
blamed
for
it
i
am
not
blaming
i
am
merely
analysing
have
you
remarked
that
when
a
man
feels
perfectly
secure
about
the
woman
he
will
give
his
hours
of
duty
to
his
country
his
hours
of
leisure
to
his
friends
who
flatter
him
and
the
crumbs
snatched
from
either
to
the
poor
lady
of
his
heart
but
if
she
excites
his
senses
and
remains
problematic
he
will
skimp
his
duty
neglect
his
friends
and
snatch
even
hours
from
sleep
to
spend
them
in
her
company
you
do
think
then
that
there
is
something
higher
and
beyond
all
this
in
love
george
something
which
you
and
i
have
never
come
across
perhaps
if
one
met
a
woman
who
was
all
man
in
mind
all
woman
in
body
and
all
child
in
soul
it
is
possible
but
where
are
these
phoenixes
to
be
discovered
my
son
it
is
wiser
not
to
dissatisfy
oneself
by
thinking
of
them
but
just
go
on
accepting
that
which
is
always
accorded
to
the
very
rich
by
the
way
i
saw
suzette
la
blonde
dining
last
night
with
old
solly
jesse
le
comte
jessé
she
had
a
new
string
of
pearls
on
and
was
stroking
his
fat
hand
while
her
lips
curled
with
love
i
thought
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
and
laughed
and
laughed
and
i
had
imagined
that
suzette
really
felt
for
me
and
would
grieve
for
at
least
a
week
or
two
but
i
am
replaced
in
four
days
i
do
not
think
i
even
felt
bitter
all
those
things
seem
so
far
away
now
when
george
had
gone
i
said
to
myself
all
man
in
mind
yes
i
am
sure
she
is
all
woman
in
body
certainly
that
all
child
in
soul
i
want
to
know
about
her
soul
if
we
have
souls
as
nina
says
by
the
way
i
will
send
a
messenger
into
the
ritz
with
a
note
to
ask
nina
to
spend
the
day
with
me
we
have
got
accustomed
to
the
impossible
difficulty
of
telephoning
to
paris
and
waiting
hours
for
telegrams
a
messenger
is
the
quickest
in
the
end
how
the
war
drags
on
will
it
really
finish
this
year
after
all
people
are
very
depressed
these
last
days
i
do
not
write
of
any
of
this
in
my
journal
others
will
chronicle
every
shade
when
i
let
myself
think
of
it
i
grow
too
wild
i
become
feverish
with
longing
to
be
up
and
with
the
old
regiment
when
i
read
of
their
deeds
then
i
grow
rebellious
no
news
yet
it
is
unbearable
burton
returned
from
auteuil
with
no
clue
whatsoever
except
that
the
at
the
hotel
de
courville
had
never
heard
of
the
name
of
sharp
that
proves
to
me
that
sharp
is
not
alathea
name
at
all
he
was
a
newcomer
and
there
were
so
many
young
ladies
who
came
and
went
to
see
madame
la
duchesse
that
he
could
not
identify
anyone
in
particular
by
description
nina
turned
up
early
on
saturday
in
time
for
lunch
she
was
looking
ravishing
in
entirely
new
clothes
like
suzette
she
has
found
that
the
is
altering
germans
may
be
attacking
paris
friends
and
relations
may
be
dying
in
heaps
but
women
must
have
new
clothes
and
fashion
must
have
her
say
as
to
their
shapes
and
what
a
mercy
it
is
so
if
there
was
nothing
to
relieve
war
and
seriousness
all
the
nations
would
be
raving
lunatics
by
now
jim
will
be
crazy
about
you
nina
when
he
sees
you
in
that
hat
yes
wo
he
i
put
it
on
to
make
you
crazy
now
of
course
i
always
am
no
nicholas
you
were
once
but
you
are
altered
some
quite
new
influence
has
come
into
your
life
you
do
say
half
such
horrid
things
we
lunched
in
the
restaurant
some
of
the
supreme
war
council
were
about
at
the
different
tables
and
we
exchanged
a
few
words
nina
preferred
it
to
my
englishmen
do
look
attractive
in
uniform
nicholas
do
they
she
said
i
wonder
if
i
had
seen
jim
in
ordinary
things
if
i
would
have
been
so
drawn
to
him
who
knows
do
you
remember
how
sensible
you
were
about
him
and
rochester
it
is
splendid
that
it
has
turned
out
so
well
where
is
happiness
nicholas
and
her
eyes
became
dreamy
i
have
a
well
balanced
nature
and
am
grateful
for
what
has
been
given
me
in
jim
but
i
ca
pretend
that
i
have
found
perfect
content
because
some
part
of
me
is
always
hungry
i
believe
really
that
you
were
the
only
person
who
could
have
fulfilled
all
i
wanted
in
a
man
nina
you
had
not
the
least
feeling
for
me
when
you
first
saw
me
after
i
was
wounded
do
you
remember
you
felt
like
a
sister
a
mother
and
a
family
friend
yes
was
not
that
odd
because
of
course
the
things
which
used
to
attract
me
in
you
and
which
could
again
now
were
there
all
the
time
at
that
moment
you
were
so
occupied
with
blue
eyes
and
his
nice
teeth
and
his
hair
was
brushed
and
well
his
uniform
fitted
to
say
nothing
of
his
and
his
that
you
could
not
appreciate
anything
else
you
have
a
your
teeth
are
divine
and
you
too
have
blue
eyes
nicholas
eye
please
the
singular
or
plural
in
this
case
makes
all
the
difference
but
i
shall
have
my
new
one
in
fairly
soon
now
and
then
illusion
will
help
me
nina
sighed
illusion
i
am
just
not
going
to
think
of
what
perhaps
might
have
happened
if
i
had
not
been
surrounded
with
illusion
last
february
well
you
can
always
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
as
your
interest
in
jim
diminishes
so
his
will
increase
george
harcourt
and
i
thrashed
it
all
out
the
other
day
and
you
yourself
admitted
it
when
we
dined
to
keep
the
hunting
instinct
alive
is
the
thing
you
will
have
the
fondest
lover
when
you
go
back
to
queen
street
nina
i
suppose
so
but
would
it
not
be
wonderful
if
one
had
not
to
play
any
game
but
could
just
love
and
be
so
satisfied
with
each
other
that
there
would
not
be
any
fear
nina
eyes
were
sad
did
she
remember
my
words
at
our
last
meeting
yes
that
would
be
heaven
is
that
what
you
are
dreaming
about
nicholas
perhaps
what
a
fortunate
woman
she
will
be
and
of
yourself
what
shall
you
give
her
i
shall
give
her
passion
and
tenderness
and
protection
and
devotion
she
shall
share
the
thoughts
of
my
mind
and
the
aspirations
of
my
soul
nicholas
you
talking
in
this
romantic
way
she
must
be
a
miracle
no
she
is
just
a
little
girl
and
it
is
she
who
has
made
you
think
about
souls
i
expect
so
well
i
must
not
think
of
them
or
of
anything
but
what
a
good
time
we
shall
all
have
when
the
war
is
over
and
what
nice
things
i
bought
in
paris
and
of
how
jim
is
let
us
talk
of
something
else
so
we
spoke
of
matters
and
then
we
went
into
the
and
nina
stayed
by
my
bath
chair
and
amused
me
but
she
does
not
know
anything
about
versailles
or
its
history
and
she
can
not
make
psychological
deductions
and
all
the
time
i
was
understanding
with
one
part
of
me
that
her
hat
was
awfully
becoming
and
everything
about
her
perfect
and
with
another
part
i
was
seeing
that
her
brain
is
limited
and
that
if
i
had
married
her
i
should
have
been
bored
to
death
and
when
the
evening
came
and
she
left
me
after
our
long
day
i
felt
a
sense
of
relief
oh
there
can
be
no
one
in
the
world
like
my
alathea
with
her
little
red
hands
and
cheap
cotton
garments
i
realize
now
that
life
used
to
be
made
up
of
the
physical
and
that
something
perhaps
suffering
has
taught
me
that
the
mental
and
the
spiritual
matter
more
even
if
she
does
come
back
how
am
i
to
break
through
the
wall
of
ice
which
she
has
surrounded
herself
with
since
the
suzette
cheque
business
i
ca
explain
she
wo
even
know
that
i
have
parted
with
her
of
course
she
has
heard
the
fluffies
often
in
the
next
room
when
they
have
come
to
play
bridge
in
the
afternoon
perhaps
she
may
even
have
heard
the
idiotic
things
they
talk
about
yes
of
course
she
must
have
an
awful
impression
of
me
the
contrast
of
her
life
and
theirs
and
mine
i
shall
go
on
with
my
plato
it
bores
me
it
is
difficult
and
i
am
tired
but
xiii
suspense
is
the
hardest
thing
to
bear
what
a
ridiculous
truism
it
has
been
said
a
thousand
times
before
and
will
be
said
a
thousand
times
again
because
it
has
come
to
everyone
at
some
moment
and
so
its
pain
is
universally
understood
to
have
attained
serenity
would
mean
that
one
was
strong
enough
not
to
allow
suspense
to
cause
one
a
moment
doubt
or
distress
i
am
far
from
serenity
i
fear
for
i
am
filled
with
unrest
i
try
to
tell
myself
that
alathea
sharp
does
not
matter
in
my
life
at
all
that
this
is
the
end
that
i
am
not
to
be
influenced
by
her
movements
or
her
thoughts
or
her
comings
and
goings
i
try
not
to
think
of
her
even
as
alathea
and
then
when
i
have
succeeded
in
some
measure
in
all
this
a
hideous
feeling
of
sinking
comes
over
me
that
physical
sensation
of
a
lead
weight
below
the
heart
what
on
earth
is
the
good
of
living
an
ugly
maimed
life
it
was
ten
times
easier
to
carry
on
under
the
most
disgusting
and
fearsome
circumstances
when
i
was
fighting
than
it
is
now
when
everything
is
done
for
my
comfort
and
i
have
all
that
money
can
buy
what
money
can
not
buy
is
of
the
only
real
consequence
though
i
must
read
henley
again
and
try
to
feel
the
thrill
of
pride
i
used
to
feel
when
i
was
a
boy
at
the
line
i
am
the
master
of
my
fate
i
am
the
captain
of
my
soul
what
if
she
does
not
come
back
and
i
do
not
hear
any
more
of
her
stop
nicholas
thormonde
this
is
contemptible
weakness
this
evening
it
was
wonderful
on
the
terrace
the
sun
set
in
a
blaze
of
crimson
and
purple
and
gold
every
window
in
the
des
seemed
to
be
on
fire
strange
ghosts
of
courtiers
appeared
to
be
flitting
past
the
mirrors
what
do
they
think
of
the
turmoil
they
have
left
behind
them
i
wonder
each
generation
torn
by
the
same
anguish
which
the
worries
of
love
bring
and
what
is
love
for
just
to
surround
the
instinct
with
glamour
and
render
it
æsthetic
did
cave
men
love
they
were
exempt
from
pain
of
the
mind
at
all
events
civilization
has
augmented
the
mental
anguishes
and
pleasures
of
love
and
when
civilization
is
in
excess
it
certainly
distorts
and
perverts
the
whole
passion
but
what
is
love
anyway
the
thing
itself
i
mean
it
is
a
want
and
an
ache
and
a
craving
i
know
what
i
want
i
want
firstly
alathea
for
my
own
with
everything
which
that
term
implies
of
possession
then
i
want
to
share
her
thoughts
and
i
want
to
feel
all
the
great
aspirations
of
her
soul
i
want
her
companionship
i
want
her
sympathy
i
want
her
understanding
when
i
was
in
love
with
nina
and
five
or
six
others
i
never
thought
of
any
of
these
things
i
just
wanted
their
bodies
therefore
it
is
only
when
the
spiritual
enters
into
the
damned
thing
i
suppose
that
one
could
call
it
love
by
that
reasoning
i
have
loved
only
alathea
in
all
my
life
but
i
am
stumped
with
this
thought
if
she
had
one
eye
and
no
leg
below
the
knee
should
i
be
in
love
with
her
and
feel
all
these
exalted
emotions
about
her
i
can
not
honestly
be
certain
how
i
would
answer
that
question
yet
so
this
shows
that
the
physical
plays
the
chief
rôle
even
in
a
love
that
seems
spiritual
matho
in
flaubert
salammbô
was
beaten
to
a
jelly
but
his
eyes
still
flamed
with
love
for
his
princess
but
when
she
saw
him
as
this
revolting
mass
did
her
love
flame
for
him
or
was
she
exalted
only
by
the
incense
to
her
vanity
and
a
pity
for
his
sufferings
heloise
and
abelard
were
pretty
wonderful
in
their
love
but
his
love
became
transmuted
much
sooner
than
hers
because
all
physical
emotions
were
gone
from
him
plato
idea
that
man
gravitates
towards
beauty
for
some
subconscious
soul
desire
to
himself
through
perfection
and
so
attain
immortality
is
probably
the
truth
and
that
is
why
we
shrink
from
mutilated
bodies
until
i
can
be
quite
sure
that
i
should
love
alathea
just
the
same
were
she
disfigured
as
i
am
i
can
not
in
justice
expect
her
to
return
my
passion
nina
became
if
i
can
coin
that
word
because
i
was
out
of
reach
the
predatory
instinct
in
woman
had
received
a
rebuff
and
demanded
renewed
she
still
keeps
a
picture
in
some
part
of
her
mental
vision
of
what
i
was
too
therefore
i
am
not
so
revolting
to
her
but
alathea
has
not
this
advantage
and
has
seen
me
only
wounded
i
have
done
nothing
to
earn
her
respect
she
has
apprehended
my
useless
life
in
these
last
months
she
has
heard
the
chattering
of
my
companions
whom
i
have
been
free
to
choose
the
obvious
deduction
being
that
these
are
what
i
desire
and
finally
she
knows
that
i
have
had
a
in
heaven
name
should
she
be
anything
but
what
she
is
in
her
manner
to
me
of
course
she
despises
me
so
that
the
only
thing
i
could
possibly
allure
her
by
would
be
that
intangible
something
which
nina
and
suzette
and
even
coralie
have
inferred
that
i
possess
it
and
how
would
that
translate
itself
to
a
mind
like
alathea
it
might
mean
nothing
to
her
it
probably
would
not
the
only
times
i
have
ever
seen
any
feeling
at
all
in
her
for
me
were
when
she
thought
she
had
destroyed
a
wounded
man
interest
in
a
harmless
hobby
and
felt
remorse
and
the
freezing
reserve
which
showed
when
she
handed
me
the
and
the
perturbation
and
contempt
when
i
was
rude
about
the
at
other
times
she
has
shown
a
blank
indifference
or
a
momentary
consciousness
that
there
was
admiration
in
my
eye
for
her
now
what
do
i
get
out
of
the
iciness
over
suzette
cheque
two
possibilities
one
that
she
is
more
prudish
than
one
of
her
literary
cultivation
and
worldly
knowledge
is
likely
to
be
so
that
she
strongly
disapproves
of
a
man
having
a
or
two
that
she
has
sensed
that
i
love
her
and
was
affronted
at
the
discovery
that
at
the
same
time
i
had
a
friend
the
second
possibility
gives
me
hope
and
so
i
fear
to
entertain
a
belief
in
it
but
taken
coldly
it
seems
the
most
now
if
she
had
been
affronted
at
this
stage
would
she
have
gone
on
believing
i
loved
her
and
so
eventually
have
shown
some
reciprocity
it
is
just
possible
and
as
it
is
will
that
same
instinct
which
is
in
the
subconscious
mind
of
all
women
and
men
too
for
the
matter
of
that
which
makes
them
want
to
fight
to
retain
or
retake
what
was
theirs
influence
her
now
unconsciously
to
feel
some
even
contemptuous
interest
in
me
this
also
is
possible
if
only
fate
brings
her
to
me
again
that
is
where
one
is
done
when
absence
cuts
threads
it
will
be
monday
a
whole
week
since
i
received
her
telegram
i
shall
go
up
to
paris
in
the
morning
if
i
hear
nothing
and
go
myself
to
the
hotel
de
courville
to
try
and
obtain
a
trace
of
her
if
that
is
impossible
i
will
write
to
the
night
as
i
wrote
the
last
words
a
note
was
brought
to
me
by
burton
someone
had
left
at
the
hotel
dear
sir
nicholas
it
ran
i
am
very
sorry
i
have
been
unable
to
come
out
to
do
my
work
but
my
brother
died
last
tuesday
and
i
have
been
extremely
occupied
i
will
be
at
versailles
at
eleven
on
thursday
as
usual
yours
truly
a
sharp
her
firm
writing
more
like
a
man
than
a
woman
looked
a
little
shaky
at
the
end
was
she
crying
perhaps
when
she
wrote
the
letter
the
poor
little
girl
what
will
the
death
mean
to
her
eventually
will
the
necessity
to
work
be
lessened
but
even
the
gravity
of
the
news
did
not
prevent
a
feeling
of
joy
and
relief
in
me
i
would
see
her
again
only
four
days
to
wait
but
what
a
strange
note
not
any
exhibition
of
feeling
she
would
not
share
even
that
natural
emotion
of
grief
with
me
her
work
is
business
and
a
well
bred
person
ought
not
to
mix
anything
personal
into
how
will
she
be
colder
than
ever
or
will
it
have
softened
her
she
will
probably
be
more
unbending
to
burton
than
to
me
the
weather
has
changed
suddenly
the
wind
is
sighing
and
i
know
that
the
summer
is
over
i
shall
have
the
fire
lighted
and
everything
as
comfortable
as
i
can
when
she
does
turn
up
and
i
shall
have
to
stay
here
until
then
since
i
can
not
communicate
with
her
in
any
way
this
ridiculous
obscurity
as
to
her
address
must
be
cleared
away
i
must
try
to
ask
her
casually
so
as
not
to
offend
her
a
week
has
passed
alathea
came
on
thursday
i
was
sickeningly
nervous
on
thursday
morning
i
resented
it
extremely
as
yet
the
only
advance
i
have
made
is
that
i
can
control
most
of
the
outward
demonstrations
of
my
perturbations
but
not
the
sensations
themselves
i
was
sitting
in
my
chair
quite
still
when
the
door
opened
and
in
she
came
just
the
scrap
of
a
creature
in
dead
black
although
there
was
no
crepe
one
could
see
that
the
garments
were
french
trappings
of
woe
that
is
she
had
a
veil
hanging
from
her
simple
small
hat
i
felt
that
she
had
had
to
buy
these
things
for
the
funeral
and
probably
could
not
afford
a
second
set
of
more
dowdy
ones
for
her
working
clothes
so
that
there
was
that
indescribable
air
of
elegance
about
her
appearance
which
had
shown
in
the
that
sunday
the
black
was
supremely
becoming
to
her
transparent
white
skin
and
seemed
to
set
off
the
bright
bronze
brown
of
her
hair
the
rebellious
little
curls
had
slipped
out
beside
her
ears
but
the
yellow
horn
spectacles
were
as
uncompromising
as
ever
i
could
not
see
whether
her
eyes
were
sad
or
no
her
mouth
was
firm
as
usual
i
want
to
tell
you
of
my
sympathy
i
said
immediately
i
was
so
sorry
not
to
know
your
address
that
i
might
have
expressed
it
to
you
before
i
would
have
wished
to
send
you
some
flowers
thank
you
was
all
she
answered
but
her
voice
trembled
a
little
it
was
so
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
asked
you
for
your
address
before
you
must
have
thought
it
was
so
careless
and
unsympathetic
oh
no
wo
you
give
it
to
me
now
that
i
may
know
in
the
future
we
are
going
to
move
it
would
be
useless
it
is
not
decided
where
we
go
yet
i
knew
i
dared
not
insist
is
there
some
place
where
i
could
be
certain
of
a
message
reaching
you
then
because
i
would
have
asked
you
to
come
to
the
flat
and
not
out
here
if
i
could
have
found
you
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
i
could
see
she
was
in
a
corner
i
felt
an
awful
brute
but
i
had
said
it
all
quite
naturally
as
any
employer
would
who
was
quite
unaware
that
there
could
be
any
reluctance
to
give
the
information
and
i
felt
it
was
better
to
continue
in
this
strain
not
to
render
her
suspicious
after
a
second
or
two
she
gave
the
number
of
a
stationer
shop
in
the
avenue
mosart
i
pass
there
every
day
she
said
i
thanked
her
i
hope
you
did
not
hurry
back
to
your
work
i
ca
bear
to
think
that
perhaps
you
would
have
wished
to
remain
at
home
now
no
it
does
not
matter
there
was
an
infinite
weariness
in
her
tone
a
hopeless
flatness
i
had
never
heard
before
it
moved
me
so
that
i
blurted
out
oh
i
have
felt
so
anxious
and
so
sorry
i
saw
you
in
the
two
sundays
ago
in
the
thunder
storm
and
i
tried
to
get
near
the
path
i
thought
you
would
cross
to
offer
you
the
carriage
to
return
in
but
i
missed
you
perhaps
your
little
brother
caught
cold
then
there
was
a
sob
in
her
voice
yes
will
you
would
you
mind
if
we
just
did
not
speak
of
anything
but
began
work
forgive
me
i
only
want
you
to
know
that
i
so
awfully
sorry
and
oh
if
there
was
anything
in
the
world
i
could
do
for
you
would
you
not
let
me
i
appreciate
your
wish
it
is
kind
of
you
but
there
is
nothing
you
were
going
to
begin
the
last
chapter
over
again
here
is
the
old
one
i
will
take
off
my
hat
while
you
look
at
it
and
she
handed
it
to
me
of
course
i
could
not
say
anything
more
i
had
had
a
big
bunch
of
violets
put
on
the
table
where
she
types
in
burton
room
adjoining
they
were
the
first
forced
ones
which
could
be
got
in
paris
and
i
had
slipped
a
card
by
them
with
just
my
sympathy
on
it
when
she
came
back
into
the
room
hatless
her
cheeks
were
bright
pink
below
the
glasses
and
all
she
said
was
thank
you
and
then
i
saw
a
little
streak
of
wet
trickle
from
under
the
horn
rims
i
have
never
had
such
a
temptation
in
my
life
to
stretch
out
my
arms
and
cry
darling
one
let
me
comfort
you
here
clasped
close
to
me
i
longed
to
touch
her
to
express
somehow
that
i
felt
profoundly
for
her
miss
sharp
i
did
burst
out
i
am
not
saying
anything
because
i
know
you
do
want
me
to
but
it
is
not
because
i
do
not
feel
i
i
awfully
sorry
may
not
i
perhaps
send
some
roses
to
your
home
or
perhaps
there
is
someone
there
who
would
like
them
flowers
are
such
jolly
things
then
i
felt
the
awfully
ill
chosen
word
jolly
was
but
i
could
not
alter
it
i
believe
that
on
my
part
helped
though
a
little
her
fine
senses
understood
it
was
because
i
was
so
nervously
anxious
to
offer
comfort
a
much
kinder
note
came
into
her
voice
i
take
the
violets
with
me
if
you
will
let
me
she
said
please
do
trouble
about
anything
more
and
do
let
us
begin
work
so
we
started
upon
the
chapter
her
hands
were
not
so
red
i
noticed
i
am
becoming
sensitive
to
what
is
called
atmosphere
i
suppose
for
i
felt
all
the
currents
in
the
room
were
disturbed
that
ambience
of
serenity
did
not
surround
alathea
and
keep
me
unconsciously
in
awe
of
her
as
it
always
has
before
i
was
aware
that
my
natural
emotions
were
running
riot
and
that
my
one
eye
was
gazing
at
her
with
love
in
it
and
that
my
imagination
was
conjuring
up
scenes
of
delight
with
her
as
a
companion
her
want
of
complete
control
allowed
the
waves
to
reach
her
i
expect
for
i
knew
that
she
was
using
all
her
will
to
keep
her
attention
upon
the
work
and
that
she
was
nearly
as
disturbed
as
i
was
myself
but
how
was
she
disturbed
was
she
just
nervous
from
events
or
was
i
causing
her
any
personal
trouble
the
moment
i
felt
that
perhaps
i
was
a
feeling
of
assurance
and
triumph
came
over
me
then
i
used
every
bit
of
the
cunning
i
possess
i
tried
to
say
subtle
things
i
made
her
talk
about
the
ridiculous
book
and
the
utterly
unimportant
furniture
i
made
her
express
her
opinion
about
styles
and
got
out
of
her
that
a
simple
queen
anne
was
what
she
herself
i
that
she
was
giving
way
and
talking
with
less
stiffness
because
she
was
weak
with
sorrow
and
probably
had
not
had
much
sleep
i
that
it
was
not
because
she
had
forgotten
about
the
suzette
cheque
or
really
was
more
friendly
i
that
i
was
taking
an
unfair
advantage
of
her
but
i
continued
men
are
really
brutes
after
all
and
gloried
in
my
power
every
time
the
slightest
indication
showed
that
i
possessed
it
i
lost
some
of
my
diffidence
if
i
could
only
have
stood
upon
two
feet
and
seen
with
two
eyes
i
know
that
even
the
morning
would
have
ended
by
my
taking
her
in
my
arms
cost
what
might
but
as
i
was
glued
to
my
chair
she
was
enabled
always
at
this
stage
to
stay
out
of
reach
and
fenced
gallantly
with
me
by
silence
and
stiff
answers
but
by
luncheon
time
there
was
a
distinct
gain
on
my
side
i
had
made
her
feel
something
i
no
longer
was
a
nonentity
who
did
not
count
her
skin
is
so
transparent
that
the
colour
fluctuates
with
every
emotion
i
love
to
watch
it
what
a
mercy
that
i
had
very
strong
sight
for
my
one
eye
sees
quite
clearly
at
luncheon
we
talked
of
the
time
of
the
fronde
alathea
is
so
wonderfully
well
read
i
make
dashes
into
all
sorts
of
subjects
and
find
she
knows
more
of
them
than
i
do
myself
what
a
mind
she
must
have
to
have
acquired
all
this
in
her
short
years
you
are
not
thinking
of
leaving
paris
i
hope
when
you
move
i
said
as
we
drank
coffee
i
am
going
to
begin
another
book
directly
this
one
is
finished
it
is
not
yet
decided
she
answered
abruptly
i
could
not
write
without
you
silence
i
would
love
to
think
that
you
took
an
interest
in
teaching
me
how
to
be
an
author
the
faintest
shrug
of
the
shoulders
you
do
take
any
interest
no
are
not
you
very
unkind
no
if
you
have
anything
to
complain
of
in
my
work
i
will
listen
attentively
and
try
and
alter
it
you
will
never
allow
the
slightest
friendship
no
why
why
should
i
i
must
be
grateful
even
that
you
ask
a
question
i
suppose
well
i
do
know
quite
myself
why
you
should
you
think
i
am
a
rotter
you
despise
my
character
you
think
my
life
is
wasted
and
that
er
i
have
undesirable
friends
silence
miss
sharp
you
drive
me
crazy
never
answering
i
ca
think
why
you
like
to
be
so
provoking
i
was
stung
to
exasperation
sir
nicholas
and
she
put
down
her
cup
with
displeasure
if
you
will
not
keep
to
the
subject
of
work
i
am
sorry
but
i
can
not
stay
as
your
secretary
terror
seized
me
i
shall
have
to
if
you
insist
upon
it
i
suppose
but
i
am
longing
to
be
friends
with
you
and
i
ca
think
why
you
should
resent
it
so
we
are
both
english
we
are
both
unhappy
we
are
both
lonely
silence
somehow
i
do
feel
it
is
altogether
because
i
am
a
revolting
object
to
look
at
that
you
are
so
unkind
you
must
have
seen
lots
like
me
since
the
war
i
am
not
unkind
i
think
you
are
may
i
go
to
my
work
now
we
rose
from
the
table
and
for
a
second
she
was
so
near
to
me
the
pent
up
desire
of
weeks
mastered
me
and
the
tantalization
of
the
morning
overcame
me
so
that
a
frantic
temptation
seized
me
i
resist
it
i
put
out
one
arm
while
i
steadied
myself
with
the
other
by
the
back
of
a
chair
and
i
drew
her
tiny
body
towards
me
and
pressed
my
lips
to
her
cupid
bow
of
a
mouth
and
oh
god
the
pleasure
of
it
right
or
wrong
she
went
dead
white
when
i
released
her
she
trembled
and
in
her
turn
held
on
to
the
back
of
the
chair
how
dare
you
she
panted
how
dare
you
i
will
go
this
minute
you
are
not
a
gentleman
the
reaction
came
to
me
that
is
it
i
suppose
i
said
hoarsely
i
am
not
a
gentleman
underneath
the
civilization
is
mere
veneer
and
the
breaks
through
it
i
have
nothing
to
say
i
was
mad
that
is
all
you
will
have
to
weigh
up
as
to
whether
it
is
worth
your
while
to
stay
with
me
or
not
i
can
not
judge
of
that
i
can
only
assure
you
that
i
will
try
not
to
err
again
perhaps
some
day
you
will
know
how
you
have
been
making
me
suffer
lately
i
shall
go
to
my
room
now
and
you
can
let
me
have
your
decision
in
an
hour
or
so
i
could
not
move
because
my
crutch
had
fallen
to
the
floor
out
of
my
reach
she
stood
in
indecision
for
a
moment
and
then
she
bent
and
picked
it
up
and
gave
it
to
me
she
was
still
as
white
as
a
ghost
as
i
got
to
the
door
i
turned
and
said
i
apologize
for
having
lost
my
i
am
ashamed
of
that
and
do
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
your
staying
or
not
is
a
business
arrangement
i
give
you
my
word
i
will
try
never
to
be
so
weak
again
she
was
gazing
at
me
for
once
i
had
taken
the
wind
out
of
her
sails
then
i
bowed
and
hobbled
on
into
my
bedroom
shutting
the
door
after
me
here
my
courage
deserted
me
i
got
to
the
bed
with
difficulty
and
threw
myself
down
upon
it
and
lay
there
too
filled
with
emotion
to
stir
the
thought
tormenting
me
always
have
i
burnt
my
boats
or
is
this
only
the
beginning
of
a
new
stage
time
will
tell
xiv
i
lay
and
wondered
and
wondered
what
were
alathea
emotions
after
i
left
her
should
i
ever
know
when
the
hour
was
up
i
went
back
into
the
i
had
struggled
against
the
awful
depression
which
was
overcoming
me
i
suppose
every
man
has
committed
some
action
he
is
sorry
and
ashamed
of
forced
thereto
by
some
emotion
either
of
anger
or
desire
which
has
been
too
strong
for
his
will
to
control
this
is
the
way
murders
must
often
have
been
committed
and
other
crimes
i
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
behaving
like
a
cad
or
of
doing
anything
which
i
knew
would
probably
part
us
if
my
insult
had
been
deliberate
or
planned
i
would
have
held
her
longer
and
knowing
i
was
going
to
lose
her
by
my
action
i
would
have
profited
by
it
as
i
lay
on
my
bed
in
great
pain
from
the
wrench
in
getting
there
alone
i
tried
to
analyse
things
the
nervous
excitement
in
which
she
always
plunges
me
must
have
come
to
the
culminating
point
the
only
thing
i
was
glad
about
was
that
i
had
not
attempted
to
ask
forgiveness
or
to
palliate
my
conduct
if
i
had
done
so
she
would
undoubtedly
have
walked
straight
out
of
the
hotel
but
having
just
had
the
sense
to
leave
her
to
think
for
a
while
perhaps
well
i
was
sitting
in
my
chair
feeling
some
kind
of
numb
anguish
which
i
suppose
those
going
to
be
hanged
experience
when
burton
brought
in
my
tea
and
i
heard
no
sound
of
clicking
next
door
i
asked
him
as
naturally
as
i
could
if
miss
sharp
had
gone
yes
sir
nicholas
he
answered
and
the
shock
even
though
it
was
expected
was
so
great
that
for
a
second
i
closed
my
eye
she
had
left
a
note
he
further
added
putting
the
envelope
down
on
the
table
beside
the
tray
i
made
myself
light
a
cigarette
and
not
open
it
and
i
made
myself
say
casually
i
am
afraid
she
feels
her
brother
death
dreadfully
burton
the
poor
young
lady
sir
nicholas
she
must
have
kept
up
brave
like
all
the
time
this
morning
and
then
after
lunch
when
i
come
in
while
you
were
resting
sir
it
got
too
much
for
her
i
expect
alone
for
she
was
sobbin
like
to
break
her
heart
as
i
opened
the
door
she
looked
that
forlorn
and
huddled
up
give
you
my
word
sir
nicholas
i
was
near
blubberin
myself
i
am
so
awfully
sorry
what
did
you
do
burton
i
said
let
me
bring
you
a
nice
cup
of
tea
miss
it
is
always
best
to
bring
ladies
tea
when
they
are
upset
sir
nicholas
as
you
may
know
she
thanked
me
sweet
like
as
she
always
does
and
i
made
so
bold
as
to
say
how
sorry
i
was
and
i
did
hope
she
had
not
had
any
extra
trouble
to
deal
with
over
it
and
how
i
be
so
glad
to
advance
her
her
next
week
salary
if
it
would
be
any
convenience
to
her
knowing
funerals
and
doctors
is
expensive
out
of
my
own
money
of
course
i
gave
her
to
understand
because
i
knew
she
be
bound
to
refuse
yours
sir
at
that
her
tears
burst
out
afresh
she
had
no
glasses
on
and
she
looked
no
more
than
sixteen
years
old
give
you
my
word
sir
she
thanked
me
like
as
if
it
was
something
real
kind
i
thought
of
i
felt
sort
of
ashamed
i
could
not
do
more
then
she
seemed
to
be
having
a
struggle
with
herself
just
as
if
rather
die
than
take
anything
from
anybody
and
yet
knew
she
had
to
she
turned
them
blue
eyes
on
me
streamin
with
tears
and
i
had
to
turn
away
sir
nicholas
i
had
she
says
you
ever
felt
that
you
wanted
to
be
dead
and
done
with
it
all
that
you
could
fight
any
more
ca
say
as
i
have
miss
i
answered
her
i
know
my
master
feels
that
way
often
perhaps
she
felt
kinder
sorry
for
you
too
sir
nicholas
because
as
i
said
that
she
gave
a
sort
of
extra
sharp
sob
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
i
slipped
out
of
the
room
then
and
brought
the
tea
as
quick
as
i
could
you
may
believe
me
sir
and
by
that
time
she
had
pulled
herself
together
is
stupid
to
have
any
proud
feelings
if
you
have
to
work
burton
she
said
will
be
grateful
for
the
loan
of
your
money
and
i
am
happy
to
have
such
a
friend
and
she
put
out
her
little
bit
of
a
hand
she
did
sir
nicholas
and
i
never
felt
so
proud
in
my
life
just
a
real
lady
to
her
finger
tips
she
is
sir
i
shook
it
as
gentle
as
i
could
and
then
was
obliged
to
blow
my
nose
i
felt
that
blubberish
i
left
the
room
at
once
and
when
i
come
back
for
the
tray
and
to
bring
the
money
she
had
her
hat
on
and
the
note
written
for
you
sir
i
took
the
violets
and
began
putting
them
in
the
box
for
her
to
take
but
she
stopped
me
fade
so
soon
i
will
not
take
them
thanks
she
said
have
to
do
some
shopping
before
i
go
home
and
i
could
not
carry
them
but
i
knew
it
was
not
she
did
not
want
to
take
them
perhaps
she
felt
she
given
up
enough
of
her
pride
to
take
my
money
for
one
day
so
i
said
nothing
but
that
i
did
hope
she
would
be
feeling
better
by
the
time
she
came
to
the
on
saturday
she
did
not
speak
she
just
nodded
her
head
and
smiled
kind
like
at
me
and
went
i
could
not
answer
burton
i
too
just
nodded
my
head
and
the
dear
old
boy
left
me
alone
my
very
heart
seemed
bursting
with
pain
and
remorse
when
he
had
gone
i
seized
the
letter
and
opened
it
to
sir
nicholas
thormonde
bart
it
began
and
then
dear
sir
circumstances
force
me
to
work
so
i
shall
have
to
remain
in
your
service
if
you
require
me
i
am
unfortunately
quite
defenceless
so
i
appeal
to
whatever
chivalry
there
is
in
you
not
to
make
it
so
impossible
that
i
must
again
give
in
my
resignation
yours
faithfully
a
sharp
i
fell
back
in
my
chair
in
an
agony
of
emotion
my
darling
my
queen
whose
very
footprints
i
worship
to
have
had
to
write
such
a
letter
to
me
the
unspeakable
brute
beast
i
felt
all
my
cynical
calculations
about
women
fell
from
me
i
saw
myself
as
i
had
been
all
day
utterly
selfish
not
really
feeling
for
her
grief
only
making
capital
out
of
it
for
my
own
benefit
at
that
moment
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
night
i
suffered
every
shade
of
self
reproach
and
abasement
a
man
can
feel
and
next
day
i
had
to
stay
in
bed
because
i
had
done
some
stupid
thing
to
my
leg
in
lying
down
without
help
when
i
knew
i
could
not
get
into
paris
by
saturday
when
alathea
was
to
come
to
the
flat
i
sent
burton
in
with
a
note
to
the
shop
in
the
avenue
mosart
dear
miss
sharp
i
wrote
i
am
deeply
grateful
for
your
magnanimity
i
am
utterly
ashamed
of
my
weakness
and
you
will
not
have
called
upon
my
chivalry
in
vain
i
promise
i
have
to
stay
in
bed
so
i
can
not
be
at
the
flat
and
if
you
receive
this
in
time
i
shall
be
obliged
if
you
will
come
out
here
again
on
saturday
yours
very
truly
nicholas
thormonde
then
i
never
slept
all
night
with
thoughts
of
longing
and
wondering
if
she
would
get
it
soon
enough
to
come
over
and
over
in
my
vision
i
saw
the
picture
of
her
sitting
there
in
burton
room
sobbing
my
action
was
the
last
straw
my
shameful
action
burton
showed
the
good
taste
and
the
sympathy
and
understanding
for
her
which
i
should
have
done
and
to
think
that
she
is
troubled
about
money
so
that
she
had
to
take
a
loan
from
my
dear
old
servitor
far
greater
gentleman
than
i
am
and
that
i
can
not
be
the
least
use
to
her
and
may
not
help
her
in
any
way
i
can
go
on
no
longer
in
this
anguish
as
soon
as
i
feel
that
peace
is
in
the
smallest
measure
restored
between
us
i
will
ask
her
to
marry
me
just
so
that
i
can
give
her
everything
i
shall
tell
her
that
i
expect
nothing
from
her
only
the
right
to
help
her
family
and
give
her
prosperity
and
peace
i
was
still
in
bed
on
saturday
morning
at
eleven
the
doctor
came
out
to
see
me
very
early
and
insisted
that
i
be
kept
quite
still
until
monday
so
burton
had
my
bed
table
brought
and
all
my
papers
and
things
there
had
come
a
number
of
letters
to
answer
and
he
had
asked
me
if
miss
sharp
could
not
do
them
as
soon
as
she
arrived
burton
perhaps
she
feel
not
quite
at
ease
with
me
alone
in
here
like
this
could
you
not
make
some
excuse
to
be
tidying
drawers
and
stay
while
i
am
dictating
i
said
very
good
sir
nicholas
when
he
replies
with
those
words
i
know
that
he
is
agreeing
with
reservations
out
with
what
you
are
thinking
burton
well
sir
nicholas
and
he
coughed
miss
sharp
is
that
sh
know
in
a
minute
your
things
was
likely
to
be
in
a
mess
and
that
you
got
me
there
on
purpose
it
might
make
her
awkward
like
you
may
be
right
we
will
see
how
things
turn
out
presently
i
heard
alathea
in
the
and
burton
went
in
to
see
her
sir
nicholas
is
very
poorly
miss
i
heard
him
say
the
doctor
wo
let
him
out
of
bed
i
wonder
if
you
be
so
kind
as
to
take
down
his
letters
they
are
too
much
for
him
himself
not
being
able
to
sit
up
and
i
have
not
the
time
of
course
i
will
burton
her
soft
voice
answered
i
put
the
table
and
everything
ready
and
i
thank
you
kindly
burton
went
on
i
am
glad
to
see
you
looking
better
miss
i
listened
intently
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
hear
her
taking
off
her
hat
and
then
she
came
into
the
room
to
me
but
by
that
time
my
heart
was
beating
so
that
i
could
not
speak
loud
i
said
good
morning
in
some
half
voice
and
she
answered
the
same
then
she
came
forward
to
the
table
her
dear
little
face
was
very
pale
and
there
was
something
pathetic
in
the
droop
of
her
lips
her
hands
i
noticed
were
again
not
so
red
all
the
letters
are
there
and
i
pointed
to
the
pile
it
will
be
so
good
of
you
if
you
will
do
them
now
she
took
each
one
up
and
handed
it
to
me
without
speaking
and
i
dictated
the
i
had
had
one
from
suzette
that
morning
thanking
me
for
the
villa
but
i
was
clearly
under
the
impression
that
i
had
put
it
with
the
one
from
maurice
and
one
from
daisy
ryven
at
the
other
side
of
the
bed
so
i
had
no
anxiety
about
it
then
suddenly
i
saw
alathea
cheeks
flame
crimson
and
her
mouth
shut
with
a
snap
and
i
realized
that
the
irony
of
fate
had
fallen
upon
me
again
and
that
she
had
picked
up
lavender
tinted
highly
scented
missive
she
handed
it
to
me
without
a
word
the
letter
ended
nicholas
tu
es
toujours
mon
adoré
ta
but
the
way
it
was
folded
only
showed
mon
adoré
ta
and
this
much
alathea
had
certainly
seen
i
felt
as
if
there
was
some
evil
imp
laughing
in
the
room
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
or
done
i
could
not
curse
aloud
so
i
simply
took
the
letter
put
it
with
daisy
ryven
and
indicated
that
i
was
waiting
for
the
next
one
to
be
handed
to
me
so
alathea
continued
her
but
could
anything
be
more
maddening
more
damnably
provoking
and
inopportune
why
must
the
shadow
of
suzette
fall
upon
me
all
the
time
this
of
course
will
make
any
renewal
of
even
the
coldest
friendliness
impossible
between
my
little
girl
and
me
i
can
not
ask
her
to
marry
me
now
and
perhaps
not
for
a
long
time
if
ever
the
chance
comes
to
me
again
in
any
case
her
attitude
carriage
of
head
and
expression
of
mouth
showed
contempt
as
she
finished
the
notes
and
then
she
rose
and
went
into
the
other
room
to
type
closing
the
door
after
her
and
i
lay
there
shivering
with
rage
and
chagrin
i
saw
no
more
of
alathea
that
morning
she
had
her
lunch
in
the
alone
and
burton
brought
the
dishes
in
to
me
and
after
luncheon
he
insisted
that
i
should
sleep
for
an
hour
until
two
he
had
some
accounts
for
miss
sharp
to
do
he
said
i
was
so
exhausted
that
when
i
did
fall
asleep
i
slept
until
nearly
four
and
awoke
with
a
start
and
an
agony
of
apprehension
that
she
might
have
gone
but
no
burton
said
she
was
still
there
when
i
rang
for
him
and
i
asked
her
to
come
in
again
we
went
over
one
of
the
earlier
chapters
in
the
book
and
i
made
some
alterations
in
it
she
never
showed
the
slightest
interest
nor
did
she
speak
she
merely
took
down
what
i
told
her
to
do
you
think
that
will
do
now
i
asked
when
it
was
complete
yes
tea
came
in
then
for
us
she
poured
it
out
still
without
uttering
a
word
she
remembered
my
taste
of
no
sugar
or
milk
and
put
the
cup
near
me
so
that
i
could
reach
it
she
handed
me
the
plate
of
those
nasty
biscuits
which
is
all
we
can
get
now
then
she
drank
her
own
tea
the
atmosphere
had
grown
so
tense
it
was
supremely
uncomfortable
i
felt
that
i
must
break
the
ice
how
i
wish
there
was
a
piano
here
i
remarked
of
nothing
and
of
course
she
greeted
this
with
her
usual
silence
i
am
feeling
so
rotten
if
i
could
hear
some
music
it
would
make
me
better
she
made
the
faintest
movement
with
her
head
to
show
me
i
suppose
that
she
was
listening
respectfully
but
saw
no
occasion
to
reply
i
felt
so
unspeakably
wretched
and
helpless
and
useless
lying
there
i
had
not
the
pluck
to
go
on
trying
to
talk
so
i
closed
my
eye
and
lay
still
and
then
i
heard
alathea
rise
and
softly
go
towards
the
door
i
will
type
this
at
home
and
return
it
to
the
flat
on
tuesday
if
that
will
be
all
right
she
said
and
i
answered
thank
you
and
turned
my
face
to
the
wall
and
after
a
little
when
she
had
gone
burton
came
in
and
gave
me
the
medicine
the
doctor
had
told
him
to
give
me
he
said
but
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
it
was
simply
asperine
for
then
i
fell
into
a
dreamy
sleep
and
forgot
my
aching
body
and
my
troubled
mind
and
now
i
am
much
better
in
health
again
and
am
back
in
paris
and
maurice
up
from
deauville
at
last
is
coming
to
dine
with
me
but
what
is
the
good
of
it
all
xv
i
was
awfully
glad
to
see
old
maurice
again
he
was
looking
brown
and
less
dilettante
though
his
socks
and
tie
and
eyes
matched
as
well
as
ever
he
congratulated
me
on
the
improvement
in
health
in
myself
too
and
then
he
gave
me
all
the
news
odette
has
been
painting
the
lily
and
used
some
new
skin
tightener
which
has
disfigured
her
for
the
moment
and
she
has
retired
to
the
family
place
near
bordeaux
to
weep
until
her
complexion
is
restored
again
very
unfortunate
for
her
maurice
said
because
she
had
nearly
secured
a
roving
english
peer
who
had
enjoyed
jobs
during
the
war
and
had
been
recruiting
from
the
fatigues
of
at
deauville
and
now
with
this
whisper
of
a
spoiled
skin
he
had
transferred
his
attentions
to
coralie
and
there
was
trouble
among
the
graces
alice
plaintiveness
had
actually
caught
a
very
rich
neutral
who
was
forwarding
philanthropic
schemes
for
great
ladies
and
she
hoped
soon
to
coralie
seemed
in
the
most
secure
and
happy
case
since
she
is
already
established
and
can
enjoy
herself
without
maurice
hinted
that
but
for
her
for
me
she
could
land
the
english
peer
and
divorce
poor
rené
her
docile
war
husband
and
become
an
english
countess
thou
hast
upset
everything
nicholas
duquesnois
is
desolated
coralie
changed
directly
she
saw
you
here
he
says
and
then
to
divert
herself
and
forget
you
took
lord
brockelbank
from
odette
coquin
va
and
maurice
patted
me
on
the
back
they
were
enchanted
with
my
presents
to
them
lately
he
added
and
were
all
longing
to
return
to
paris
soon
and
thank
me
the
war
was
simply
growing
into
a
nuisance
and
the
quicker
it
was
over
the
better
for
then
he
beat
about
the
bush
for
a
little
longer
and
at
last
began
to
grow
nearer
the
vital
subject
he
had
seen
some
of
my
mont
aubin
relations
fortunately
for
me
they
have
been
far
from
paris
in
this
last
year
and
they
had
anxiously
asked
him
if
i
thought
of
marrying
what
in
fact
i
doing
with
myself
now
that
my
wounds
were
healing
i
laughed
i
am
so
glad
my
mother
was
an
only
child
and
they
are
none
of
them
near
enough
to
have
the
right
to
bore
me
they
had
better
continue
their
good
works
at
biarritz
i
am
told
my
cousin
marguerite
convalescent
home
is
a
marvel
i
have
sent
her
frequent
donations
then
maurice
plunged
in
you
are
not
becoming
entangled
in
any
way
with
your
secretary
are
you
he
asked
i
had
decided
beforehand
that
i
would
not
get
angry
at
anything
he
said
so
i
was
ready
for
this
no
maurice
and
i
poured
out
a
second
glass
of
port
for
him
burton
had
left
us
alone
by
now
miss
sharp
does
not
know
that
i
exist
she
is
simply
here
to
do
her
work
and
is
the
best
secretary
any
man
could
want
i
knew
coralie
would
infect
you
with
some
silly
idea
maurice
sipped
his
coralie
said
that
in
spite
of
the
glasses
there
was
some
air
of
distinction
about
her
as
she
walked
on
and
that
she
and
you
were
interested
i
remained
undisturbed
i
am
immensely
interested
i
want
to
know
who
she
really
is
she
is
a
lady
even
a
lady
of
our
i
mean
she
knows
about
things
in
england
where
she
has
never
been
that
she
could
not
possibly
know
unless
her
family
had
spoken
of
them
always
she
has
that
unconscious
air
of
familiarity
and
ease
with
subjects
which
would
surprise
you
ca
you
find
anything
out
for
me
old
boy
as
to
who
she
is
i
will
certainly
try
sharp
it
is
not
a
name
of
the
great
world
no
of
course
that
is
not
her
real
name
why
not
ask
her
yourself
i
like
to
find
a
man
with
pluck
enough
to
ask
her
anything
she
did
not
wish
him
to
that
little
girl
but
she
appeared
meek
and
plain
and
respectable
nicholas
you
intrigue
me
well
put
your
wits
to
work
maurice
and
promise
me
you
will
not
talk
to
the
others
about
anything
i
shall
be
very
angry
if
you
do
he
gave
me
every
assurance
he
would
be
silent
as
the
grave
and
then
he
changed
the
topic
to
that
of
suzette
he
was
sorry
i
had
given
her
her
congé
because
i
would
find
it
hard
to
replace
her
those
so
honest
and
really
not
too
rapacious
were
very
difficult
to
find
since
he
had
heard
that
suzette
was
no
longer
my
little
friend
he
had
been
looking
out
for
me
but
as
yet
had
seen
nothing
suitable
you
need
not
trouble
maurice
i
told
him
i
am
absolutely
finished
with
that
part
of
my
life
i
loathe
the
whole
idea
of
it
now
maurice
inspected
me
with
grave
concern
my
dear
chap
this
appears
serious
you
are
not
with
your
secretary
are
you
or
is
it
possible
that
you
are
bluffing
and
that
she
has
replaced
suzette
and
you
wish
tranquility
about
the
subject
i
felt
a
hot
flush
mounting
to
my
forehead
the
very
thought
of
my
adored
little
girl
in
the
category
of
suzette
i
could
have
struck
my
old
friend
but
i
had
just
sense
enough
to
reason
things
maurice
was
only
speaking
as
any
of
the
paris
world
would
speak
a
secretary
whom
a
man
was
obviously
interested
in
was
certainly
not
out
of
the
running
for
the
post
of
he
meant
no
personal
disrespect
to
alathea
for
him
women
were
either
of
the
world
or
they
were
not
true
there
was
an
intermediate
class
braves
servants
typists
but
one
could
only
be
interested
in
one
of
these
for
one
reason
that
is
how
things
appeared
to
maurice
i
knew
his
views
perhaps
i
had
shared
them
in
some
measure
in
my
unregenerate
days
look
here
maurice
i
want
you
to
understand
that
miss
sharp
is
a
lady
in
every
way
i
have
already
told
you
this
but
you
do
seem
to
have
grasped
it
and
that
she
has
my
greatest
respect
and
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
anyone
talking
of
her
as
you
have
just
done
although
i
know
you
did
not
mean
anything
low
you
old
owl
she
treats
me
as
though
i
were
a
tiresome
elderly
employer
whom
she
must
give
obedience
to
but
is
not
obliged
to
converse
with
she
would
not
permit
the
slightest
friendship
or
familiarity
from
any
man
she
worked
for
your
interest
is
then
serious
nicholas
maurice
was
absolutely
aghast
my
is
serious
my
curiosity
is
hot
and
i
want
information
maurice
tried
to
feel
relieved
supposing
financial
disaster
fell
upon
your
family
old
boy
would
you
consider
your
sister
less
of
a
lady
because
she
had
to
earn
bread
for
you
all
by
being
a
typist
of
course
not
but
it
would
be
very
dreadful
marie
oh
i
could
not
think
of
it
then
try
to
get
the
idea
into
your
thick
head
that
miss
sharp
is
marie
and
behave
accordingly
that
is
how
i
look
at
her
maurice
promised
that
he
would
and
our
talk
turned
to
the
duchesse
he
had
seen
her
at
a
cross
country
station
as
he
came
up
and
she
would
be
back
in
paris
the
following
week
this
thought
gave
me
comfort
everyone
would
be
back
by
the
fifteenth
of
october
he
assured
me
and
then
we
could
all
amuse
ourselves
again
you
will
be
quite
well
enough
to
dine
out
nicholas
or
if
not
you
must
move
to
the
ritz
with
me
so
that
you
at
least
have
entertainment
on
the
spot
we
spoke
then
of
the
book
furniture
was
a
really
refined
and
interesting
subject
for
me
to
be
delving
into
maurice
longed
to
read
the
proofs
he
averred
when
he
had
left
me
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
and
asked
myself
what
had
happened
to
me
that
maurice
and
all
that
lot
seemed
such
miles
and
miles
away
from
me
as
miles
and
miles
as
they
would
have
seemed
in
their
triviality
when
we
used
to
discuss
important
questions
in
pop
at
eton
how
i
must
have
sunk
in
the
years
which
followed
those
dear
old
days
ever
even
to
have
found
divertisement
among
the
people
like
maurice
and
the
fluffies
surely
even
a
and
man
ought
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
his
country
politically
it
suddenly
seemed
to
me
and
what
a
glorious
picture
to
gaze
at
if
i
could
some
day
go
into
parliament
and
have
alathea
beside
me
to
give
me
inspiration
and
help
me
to
the
best
in
myself
how
her
poise
would
tell
in
english
political
society
how
her
brain
and
her
power
of
exercising
her
critical
faculties
apart
from
the
fact
that
i
love
every
inch
of
her
wisp
of
a
body
what
an
asset
that
mind
would
be
to
any
man
and
i
dreamed
and
dreamed
in
the
firelight
things
all
filled
with
sentiment
and
exaltation
which
of
course
no
fellow
could
ever
say
aloud
or
let
anyone
know
of
a
journal
is
certainly
an
immense
comfort
and
i
do
not
believe
i
could
have
gone
through
this
hideous
year
of
my
life
without
it
how
i
would
love
to
have
alathea
for
my
wife
and
have
children
it
ca
be
possible
that
i
have
written
that
i
loathe
children
in
the
abstract
they
bore
me
to
death
even
solonge
de
clerté
two
entertaining
angels
but
to
have
a
son
with
alathea
eyes
god
how
the
thought
makes
me
feel
how
i
would
like
to
sit
and
talk
with
her
of
how
we
should
bring
him
up
i
reached
out
my
hand
and
picked
up
a
volume
of
charles
lamb
and
read
dream
children
and
as
i
finished
i
felt
that
idiotic
choky
sensation
which
i
have
only
begun
to
know
since
something
in
me
has
been
awakened
by
alathea
or
since
my
nerves
have
been
on
the
rack
i
do
remember
ever
feeling
much
touched
or
weak
or
silly
before
the
war
and
now
what
have
i
to
face
a
will
stronger
or
as
strong
as
my
own
a
prejudice
of
the
deepest
which
i
can
not
explain
away
a
knowledge
that
i
have
no
power
to
retain
the
thing
i
love
no
guerdon
to
hold
out
to
her
mentally
or
physically
nothing
but
the
material
thing
of
money
which
because
of
her
great
unselfishness
and
desire
to
benefit
her
loved
ones
she
might
be
forced
to
consider
my
only
possibility
of
obtaining
her
at
all
is
to
buy
her
with
money
and
when
once
bought
when
i
had
her
here
in
my
house
would
i
have
the
strength
to
resist
the
temptation
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
could
i
go
on
day
after
day
never
touching
her
never
having
any
joys
until
the
greatness
of
my
love
somehow
melted
her
dislike
and
contempt
of
me
i
wish
to
god
i
knew
she
will
never
marry
me
unless
i
give
my
word
of
honour
that
the
thing
will
only
be
an
empty
ceremony
of
that
i
feel
sure
even
if
circumstances
aid
me
to
force
her
into
doing
this
much
and
then
one
has
to
keep
one
word
of
honour
and
might
not
that
be
a
greater
hell
than
i
am
now
in
of
suffering
perhaps
i
had
better
go
to
the
sea
like
suzette
and
try
to
break
the
whole
chain
and
forget
her
i
rang
the
bell
for
burton
then
and
told
him
of
my
new
plan
as
he
put
me
to
bed
we
would
go
off
to
malo
for
a
week
and
i
gave
orders
that
he
should
make
the
necessary
arrangements
to
get
permits
to
travel
anywhere
now
is
no
end
of
a
difficulty
i
wrote
to
alathea
without
weakening
i
asked
her
to
collect
the
mss
and
make
notes
of
what
she
thought
still
should
be
altered
during
my
absence
i
wrote
as
stiffly
and
in
as
business
like
a
manner
as
possible
and
finally
i
went
to
sleep
and
slept
better
than
i
have
done
for
some
time
malo
how
quaint
these
places
are
i
am
at
this
deserted
corner
by
the
sea
where
the
hotel
is
comfortable
and
hardly
touched
by
the
war
i
am
not
happy
the
air
is
doing
me
good
that
is
all
i
have
brought
books
i
am
not
trying
to
write
i
just
read
and
endeavor
to
sleep
and
the
hours
pass
i
tell
myself
continually
that
i
am
no
more
interested
in
alathea
that
i
am
going
to
get
well
and
go
back
to
england
that
i
have
emerged
and
am
a
man
with
a
free
will
once
more
and
i
am
a
great
deal
better
after
all
how
absurd
to
be
thinking
of
a
woman
from
morning
to
night
when
i
get
my
new
leg
and
everything
is
all
healed
up
in
a
year
or
two
shall
i
be
able
to
ride
again
of
course
i
shall
no
doubt
and
even
play
a
little
tennis
i
can
shoot
anyway
if
we
will
be
allowed
to
preserve
partridges
and
pheasants
when
the
war
is
over
in
england
yes
of
course
life
is
a
gorgeous
thing
i
like
the
fierce
wind
to
blow
in
my
face
and
yesterday
much
to
burton
displeasure
i
went
out
sailing
how
could
i
be
such
a
fool
he
inferred
as
to
chance
a
wrench
putting
me
back
some
months
again
but
one
has
to
chance
things
occasionally
i
never
enjoyed
a
sail
more
because
of
this
very
knowledge
a
week
has
passed
since
we
came
to
this
end
of
the
earth
and
again
i
have
grown
restless
perhaps
it
is
because
burton
came
in
just
now
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
i
recognized
immediately
alathea
writing
i
made
so
bold
as
to
leave
the
young
lady
our
address
before
we
left
sir
nicholas
in
case
she
wanted
to
communicate
with
us
and
she
writes
now
to
say
would
i
be
good
enough
to
ask
you
if
you
took
with
you
chapter
seven
because
she
can
not
find
it
anywhere
then
he
went
on
with
evident
constraint
to
tell
me
that
the
rest
of
the
letter
said
that
while
she
was
working
on
friday
a
mademoiselle
la
blonde
called
and
insisted
upon
passing
pierre
who
answered
the
door
and
coming
in
to
her
it
was
of
course
sir
nicholas
burton
snapped
and
that
she
had
demanded
my
address
but
miss
sharp
had
not
felt
she
was
justified
in
giving
it
to
her
but
had
said
letters
would
be
forwarded
i
hope
to
goodness
that
the
baggage
made
no
scene
with
the
young
lady
sir
nicholas
burton
growled
of
course
she
do
say
in
the
letter
but
it
more
than
likely
i
would
not
have
her
insulted
for
the
world
nor
i
either
i
retorted
angrily
suzette
ought
to
know
better
now
that
i
have
given
her
everything
she
wanted
will
you
let
her
understand
please
that
this
must
not
occur
again
i
see
that
the
lawyer
does
it
sir
that
is
the
only
way
to
deal
with
them
persons
though
was
the
best
of
her
sort
seems
to
me
sir
nicholas
they
are
more
bother
than
they
are
worth
i
said
it
always
even
when
i
was
younger
they
leave
their
trail
of
trouble
where
ever
they
go
how
i
agreed
with
him
so
here
was
a
fresh
barrier
arisen
between
alathea
and
myself
a
fresh
barrier
which
i
can
not
explain
away
the
only
comfort
i
get
out
of
the
whole
thing
is
that
imperative
necessity
must
have
been
driving
my
little
darling
or
she
would
not
put
up
with
any
of
these
things
for
a
moment
and
would
have
given
her
at
the
same
time
as
she
wrote
if
money
is
so
necessary
to
her
perhaps
after
all
i
could
get
her
consent
to
marry
me
the
very
thought
made
my
pulses
bound
again
and
all
my
calm
flew
to
the
winds
all
the
sage
reasoning
which
was
beginning
to
have
an
effect
upon
me
evaporated
i
knew
that
once
more
i
was
as
utterly
under
the
spell
of
her
attraction
as
the
moment
when
my
passionate
lips
touched
her
soft
reluctant
ones
ah
that
thought
that
memory
one
i
have
never
let
myself
indulge
in
but
now
all
resistance
broken
on
every
side
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
dreaming
about
the
joy
of
that
kiss
until
by
night
time
i
was
as
mad
as
a
hatter
and
more
full
of
cruel
unrest
than
ever
i
hate
this
place
i
hate
the
sea
it
is
all
of
no
use
i
shall
go
back
to
paris
xvi
the
first
thing
i
learned
when
i
reached
the
was
that
the
duchesse
had
returned
and
wished
to
see
me
this
was
good
news
and
without
even
telephoning
to
maurice
i
got
into
my
one
horse
victoria
and
repaired
to
the
hotel
de
courville
the
duchesse
was
sitting
in
her
boudoir
upstairs
when
i
got
she
had
a
quaint
expression
upon
her
face
i
was
not
certain
that
her
greeting
was
as
cordial
as
usual
has
gossip
reached
her
ears
also
i
sat
down
near
her
and
she
took
my
crutch
from
me
tenderly
her
instinct
for
never
failing
her
i
thought
i
would
begin
at
once
before
she
could
say
anything
which
might
make
questioning
her
impossible
i
have
been
longing
to
see
you
duchesse
to
ask
you
if
you
could
help
me
to
find
out
who
my
secretary
miss
sharp
is
because
i
saw
her
here
in
the
passage
one
day
and
i
thought
you
might
possibly
be
able
to
identify
her
her
christian
name
is
i
heard
her
little
sister
call
her
that
once
when
i
saw
them
and
they
did
not
see
me
in
the
she
is
a
lady
and
i
feel
sharp
is
not
her
name
at
all
the
duchesse
put
on
her
eyeglasses
she
has
not
shown
a
sign
that
she
wishes
you
to
know
her
history
no
then
my
son
do
you
think
it
is
very
good
taste
to
endeavor
to
discover
it
perhaps
not
i
was
nettled
i
hated
that
the
duchesse
should
be
displeased
with
me
then
i
went
on
i
fear
that
she
is
very
poor
and
i
know
that
her
little
brother
died
just
lately
and
i
would
give
anything
in
the
world
to
help
them
in
some
way
sometimes
one
helps
more
by
showing
discretion
you
wo
assist
me
then
duchesse
i
that
you
know
miss
sharp
she
frowned
nicholas
if
i
did
not
love
you
really
i
should
be
am
i
the
character
to
betray
friends
presuming
that
i
have
friends
for
a
young
man
curiosity
indeed
it
is
not
curiosity
it
is
because
i
want
to
help
camouflage
i
felt
angry
now
you
assume
that
your
secretary
is
a
du
she
went
on
if
you
have
reached
that
far
you
should
know
that
there
is
some
honor
some
left
in
old
families
and
so
you
should
treat
her
with
consideration
and
respect
her
all
this
is
not
like
you
my
son
the
duchesse
had
dropped
the
thee
and
thou
it
hurt
me
i
want
to
treat
her
with
every
respect
i
reiterated
then
believe
me
it
is
unnecessary
for
you
to
know
her
name
i
am
not
altogether
pleased
with
you
nicholas
dear
duchesse
that
grieves
me
i
wish
i
could
explain
i
have
only
wanted
to
be
kind
and
i
do
even
know
her
address
and
could
not
send
flowers
when
her
brother
died
they
did
not
want
flowers
perhaps
take
my
advice
of
the
best
i
can
give
pay
your
secretary
her
wages
as
high
ones
as
she
will
accept
and
then
treat
her
as
if
she
were
fifty
years
old
and
wore
glasses
she
does
wear
glasses
abominable
yellow
horn
rimmed
spectacles
i
announced
have
you
never
seen
them
the
duchesse
eyes
flashed
i
have
not
said
i
ever
met
miss
sharp
nicholas
i
knew
the
affair
was
now
hopeless
and
that
i
would
only
risk
the
real
displeasure
of
my
dear
old
friend
if
i
continued
in
this
way
so
i
i
had
some
instinct
too
that
i
would
not
receive
sympathy
even
if
i
owned
that
my
intentions
were
strictly
honourable
i
will
say
no
more
except
that
should
you
know
these
people
and
you
ever
discover
that
i
could
help
them
in
any
way
that
you
will
call
upon
me
to
any
extent
illustration
the
fiery
vixen
suzette
renee
adoree
is
enraged
to
learn
of
sir
nicholas
lew
cody
attentions
to
other
women
and
leaves
in
a
flurry
a
scene
from
elinor
glyn
production
man
and
maid
for
she
looked
at
me
very
searchingly
and
said
laconically
then
we
talked
of
other
things
and
i
tried
to
reingratiate
myself
the
war
was
going
better
foch
would
wish
to
push
his
advantage
things
must
have
some
end
in
the
near
when
was
i
going
to
england
all
these
subjects
we
discussed
when
i
am
out
of
the
hands
of
these
doctors
and
have
my
new
leg
and
eye
i
will
return
and
then
i
want
to
go
into
parliament
the
duchesse
warmed
up
at
that
was
just
the
thing
for
me
to
do
that
and
to
marry
some
nice
girl
of
my
own
world
of
which
there
must
be
an
embarrassment
of
choice
with
all
the
men
killed
in
my
country
i
would
want
such
an
exceptional
woman
duchesse
do
not
look
for
the
moon
my
son
be
thankful
if
she
has
been
sufficiently
well
brought
up
to
have
a
decent
conduct
the
manners
of
the
young
girls
now
revolt
i
try
to
go
with
the
times
but
these
new
fashions
are
disgusting
do
you
think
a
woman
ought
to
be
perfectly
innocent
and
ignorant
of
life
to
make
the
marriage
happy
i
asked
the
insides
of
the
minds
of
young
girls
one
is
never
sure
of
but
the
should
be
correct
at
all
costs
so
that
they
may
have
something
to
uphold
them
as
well
as
religion
which
is
no
longer
so
surrounding
as
it
used
to
be
duchesse
i
want
someone
who
would
love
me
passionately
and
whom
i
could
passionately
love
for
that
my
poor
boy
and
she
sighed
it
is
not
found
among
young
girls
these
things
come
after
one
knows
and
can
discriminate
put
them
aside
from
your
thoughts
they
are
temptations
which
one
resists
if
one
can
and
at
all
events
makes
no
scandals
love
it
is
the
song
of
the
poets
it
can
not
happen
in
the
world
with
satisfaction
it
must
be
a
pain
always
do
your
duty
to
your
race
and
your
class
and
try
not
to
mix
up
sentiment
with
it
there
is
no
hope
of
my
finding
someone
i
could
really
love
then
i
do
not
know
in
your
own
country
it
may
be
here
it
is
the
wife
of
someone
else
who
holds
the
charm
and
if
it
were
not
for
society
could
not
exist
all
that
one
must
ask
of
the
young
is
that
they
act
with
discretion
so
that
they
can
reach
the
autumn
of
life
without
scandals
against
their
names
if
the
adds
love
then
they
have
been
indeed
fortunate
but
duchesse
with
your
great
heart
have
you
never
loved
her
eyes
seemed
to
grow
beautiful
and
young
again
they
diffused
a
fire
loved
nicholas
all
women
love
once
in
their
lives
happy
for
them
if
it
has
not
burnt
their
souls
in
its
passage
happy
if
the
has
let
it
merge
into
love
for
humanity
and
soft
tears
dimmed
the
dark
blue
brilliancy
i
leaned
forward
and
kissed
her
hand
with
deep
devotion
then
the
ancient
servitor
came
in
and
she
was
called
to
a
ward
but
i
left
feeling
that
if
there
is
really
some
barrier
of
family
between
alathea
and
me
there
would
be
no
use
in
my
appealing
to
the
duchesse
sorrows
she
understands
and
war
and
suffering
and
love
she
understands
and
passion
and
all
that
appertains
thereto
but
all
these
things
go
to
the
wall
before
the
conception
of
the
meaning
of
which
ruled
when
adelaide
de
mont
orgeuil
wedded
the
duc
de
in
the
eighties
the
only
thing
left
now
was
to
telephone
to
maurice
he
came
in
for
a
few
minutes
just
before
dinner
he
has
questioned
alwood
chester
of
the
american
red
cross
who
had
told
him
that
miss
sharp
had
been
miss
sharp
always
while
she
worked
for
them
and
that
no
one
knew
anything
further
about
her
well
if
her
father
is
a
convict
and
her
mother
in
a
mad
house
and
her
sister
consumptive
i
still
want
her
for
herself
is
that
true
could
i
face
disease
and
insanity
coming
into
my
family
i
do
know
all
i
know
is
that
i
do
not
believe
whatever
curse
hangs
over
the
rest
it
has
touched
her
she
is
the
picture
of
health
and
balance
and
truth
her
every
action
is
noble
and
i
love
her
i
love
her
there
next
day
she
came
in
at
ten
as
usual
she
brought
all
the
chapters
annotated
as
her
attitude
towards
me
had
been
as
cold
as
it
was
possible
for
an
attitude
to
be
i
can
not
say
that
there
was
any
added
shade
of
contempt
since
her
interview
with
suzette
what
had
passed
between
them
perhaps
burton
will
be
able
gradually
to
discover
i
controlled
myself
and
behaved
with
a
businesslike
reserve
she
had
nothing
to
snub
me
for
or
to
disturb
her
she
took
the
papers
at
twelve
and
i
sighed
as
she
left
the
room
i
had
watched
her
furtively
for
nearly
two
hours
her
face
was
a
mask
and
she
might
indeed
really
have
been
concentrating
upon
the
work
in
hand
her
hands
are
whitening
considerably
i
believe
their
redness
had
something
to
do
with
her
little
brother
perhaps
she
put
very
hot
things
on
his
i
have
never
seen
such
a
white
skin
it
shows
like
mother
of
pearl
against
the
cheap
black
frock
the
line
of
the
throat
is
like
my
fascinating
nymph
with
the
shell
indeed
the
mouth
is
not
unlike
her
also
i
wonder
if
she
has
dimp
but
i
had
better
not
think
of
those
things
i
am
now
determined
to
ask
her
to
marry
me
on
the
first
occasion
i
can
screw
up
my
courage
sufficiently
i
have
decided
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
am
going
to
be
quite
matter
of
fact
i
sha
tell
her
that
i
love
her
even
i
feel
if
i
can
secure
her
first
i
shall
have
a
better
chance
afterwards
if
she
thought
i
loved
her
her
nature
is
of
that
honest
kind
that
she
might
think
it
was
dishonorable
to
make
so
uneven
a
bargain
with
me
but
if
she
just
thinks
i
want
her
for
my
secretary
and
to
play
to
me
and
even
perhaps
that
there
is
some
brute
part
which
she
despises
mixed
up
in
my
feeling
for
her
and
which
i
would
promise
to
keep
in
check
she
may
feel
that
it
is
fair
for
her
to
take
my
name
and
my
money
and
give
me
nothing
in
return
after
lunch
which
we
did
not
have
together
george
harcourt
came
in
and
diverted
me
until
four
after
we
had
discussed
the
war
news
for
a
long
time
he
began
as
usual
about
violetta
she
was
perfection
she
had
fulfilled
all
he
had
ever
asked
of
a
woman
but
or
rather
in
consequence
of
this
she
had
begun
to
bore
him
while
a
new
vixen
with
no
heart
and
the
brain
of
a
rabbit
now
drew
him
strangely
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
my
dear
george
deceive
her
of
course
nicholas
it
is
a
painful
necessity
that
my
kind
heart
forces
me
to
perpetrate
he
was
smoking
contemplatively
i
laughed
you
see
dear
boy
one
ca
be
brutal
with
the
little
darlings
so
that
is
the
only
course
open
to
one
for
their
limited
reasoning
power
does
not
enable
them
to
grasp
that
it
is
not
one
fault
at
all
when
one
ceases
to
care
the
trouble
lies
with
their
own
weakening
so
one
has
to
go
on
bluffing
until
they
themselves
weary
or
find
out
inadvertently
that
one
affection
has
been
transferred
do
you
think
there
are
some
to
whom
you
could
tell
the
truth
i
have
not
met
any
if
they
do
exist
if
i
were
a
woman
it
would
insult
me
far
more
for
a
man
to
think
i
was
so
stupid
that
he
could
deceive
me
than
if
he
said
frankly
he
no
longer
cared
probably
but
then
women
do
reason
in
that
way
you
might
prove
by
every
law
of
logic
that
it
was
because
they
themselves
had
disillusioned
you
and
that
you
had
no
control
over
the
coming
or
going
of
your
emotion
but
at
the
end
of
your
peroration
they
would
still
reproach
you
for
being
a
fickle
brute
and
believe
themselves
blameless
and
sinned
against
it
is
all
very
difficult
i
sighed
unconsciously
are
you
in
some
mess
my
son
george
asked
in
your
case
with
suzette
money
can
always
smooth
things
she
has
perhaps
been
annoying
i
have
entirely
finished
with
suzette
george
how
a
man
pays
for
all
his
follies
have
you
with
all
your
affairs
ever
got
off
scot
free
george
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
well
cut
face
which
expresses
as
a
rule
a
rather
kindly
whimsical
cynicism
grew
stern
and
his
very
voice
altered
nicholas
one
has
to
pay
one
shot
every
time
a
man
pays
in
money
or
in
jewels
or
in
disgrace
or
in
regret
and
remorse
and
he
has
to
calculate
beforehand
to
what
extent
that
which
he
desires
is
worth
the
price
which
will
become
due
it
is
a
brainless
idiot
who
does
not
calculate
or
who
laments
when
he
has
to
stump
up
i
admit
women
are
of
supreme
interest
to
me
and
their
companionship
and
affection
bought
or
otherwise
are
necessary
to
my
existence
so
i
resignedly
discharged
my
debt
every
time
how
will
you
pay
it
then
about
violetta
whom
you
say
is
an
angel
and
blameless
i
shall
have
some
disgusting
moments
of
discomfort
and
remorse
and
feel
a
moral
bluebeard
i
sha
go
scot
free
and
she
that
wo
help
her
she
will
pay
in
tears
for
having
been
weak
enough
to
love
me
she
will
feel
the
consolation
of
martyrdom
and
soon
forget
me
and
you
do
think
one
incurs
some
kind
of
hoodoo
in
indulging
in
these
things
i
am
thinking
of
suzette
her
shadow
almost
one
would
say
projected
by
fate
is
what
is
causing
me
trouble
now
not
any
deliberate
action
she
is
committing
against
me
part
of
the
price
my
boy
you
ca
steal
anything
or
do
anything
against
the
law
be
it
of
man
or
of
morals
or
of
the
spirit
that
you
do
have
to
pay
for
it
and
there
is
no
use
in
haggling
beforehand
or
in
squealing
after
the
thing
is
to
learn
early
enough
in
life
what
is
worth
while
and
what
you
really
want
before
you
lay
up
for
yourself
limitations
that
is
true
now
let
us
analyse
what
gains
and
losses
you
have
had
in
the
suzette
business
let
us
take
the
gains
first
you
had
a
jolly
little
companion
during
some
months
of
pain
and
weariness
she
helped
you
over
a
difficult
moment
you
were
not
leading
her
astray
to
be
the
friend
of
was
her
you
paid
her
highly
in
solid
cash
you
are
under
no
obligation
to
her
but
the
law
has
decreed
that
man
must
have
no
illicit
relations
so
the
force
of
that
current
or
belief
or
whatever
it
is
makes
you
pay
some
price
for
having
broken
the
law
accept
it
and
get
through
with
it
and
if
the
price
has
been
too
heavy
decide
not
to
incur
such
debts
again
the
whole
bother
occurs
because
you
do
look
ahead
my
boy
there
was
a
case
when
i
was
a
youngster
and
just
joined
my
battalion
of
guards
which
will
illustrate
what
i
mean
of
bobby
bulteel
hartelford
he
cheated
at
cards
he
was
a
kind
of
cousin
of
my
mother
so
the
family
felt
the
scandal
awfully
he
was
kicked
out
of
course
and
utterly
broke
and
lady
hilda
marchant
ran
off
with
him
and
left
her
husband
she
adored
the
fellow
who
had
every
charm
well
that
was
not
worth
while
the
odds
are
too
heavy
for
anyone
ever
to
have
the
ghost
of
a
chance
to
pull
cheating
off
he
was
simply
a
fool
you
see
take
chances
but
never
when
the
scales
have
gone
beyond
the
angle
of
degrees
then
having
finished
his
cigar
george
rose
in
the
best
of
tempers
you
may
take
it
from
me
nicholas
it
sounds
old
fashioned
but
to
behave
like
a
gentleman
and
always
be
ready
to
discharge
your
obligations
are
the
best
rules
for
ta
ta
dear
boy
shall
look
in
on
you
soon
again
and
he
went
of
course
his
logic
is
unanswerable
so
i
had
better
accept
the
shadow
of
suzette
falling
upon
my
relation
with
alathea
and
try
to
gain
my
end
in
spite
of
it
and
what
is
my
very
end
not
of
course
that
i
shall
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
as
hungry
and
longing
and
miserable
but
that
after
securing
her
certain
companionship
i
shall
overcome
her
prejudices
conquer
her
aversion
and
make
her
love
but
to
have
the
chance
to
do
all
this
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
shall
be
near
her
always
so
my
idea
of
marriage
is
not
so
after
all
and
if
she
will
accept
me
someday
upon
provided
they
do
not
mean
separation
i
shall
believe
that
half
the
battle
is
won
i
feel
more
cheerful
already
how
sound
reasoning
does
one
good
even
if
it
is
as
baldly
brutal
as
george
xvii
burton
gave
forth
some
information
this
evening
as
he
was
dressing
me
for
dinner
he
had
now
discovered
from
pierre
how
suzette
had
behaved
when
she
intruded
upon
alathea
she
had
entered
the
room
passing
pierre
without
so
much
as
asking
his
leave
and
he
with
his
wooden
leg
not
so
nimble
as
might
be
she
had
gone
to
the
writing
table
and
demanded
my
address
an
affair
of
business
which
must
be
attended
to
at
once
she
had
announced
pierre
standing
at
the
door
had
heard
all
this
burton
added
he
said
that
was
that
scented
and
that
got
up
of
course
miss
sharp
must
have
known
what
she
was
alathea
apparently
had
answered
with
dignity
that
she
had
received
no
orders
to
give
any
address
but
that
letters
would
be
forwarded
she
took
no
more
notice
of
than
if
she
was
a
chair
pierre
had
told
him
who
having
his
own
troubles
with
women
was
prepared
to
see
a
conflict
suzette
became
nonplussed
and
losing
her
temper
a
little
told
alathea
that
she
hoped
she
would
get
as
much
out
of
the
situation
as
she
herself
had
done
alathea
continued
writing
as
though
she
had
not
heard
and
then
told
her
quite
politely
in
french
that
if
she
would
kindly
leave
whatever
letters
were
to
be
sent
on
she
would
see
that
they
went
that
night
and
had
added
now
i
need
not
detain
you
longer
suzette
became
furious
and
stamping
said
she
was
mademoiselle
la
blonde
and
had
more
right
there
than
alathea
pierre
had
here
interfered
and
catching
hold
of
suzette
arm
had
dragged
her
from
the
room
i
tingled
with
shame
and
wrath
that
the
person
i
respect
most
in
the
world
should
have
been
exposed
to
such
a
scene
burton
too
was
horrified
i
had
the
most
awful
sensation
of
discomfort
the
very
fact
of
having
to
hear
of
all
this
through
servants
was
sufficiently
disgusting
without
the
events
themselves
being
so
degrading
what
must
alathea
think
of
me
and
i
can
not
even
allude
to
the
subject
how
wonderful
her
dignity
has
been
that
she
has
allowed
no
extra
contempt
to
come
into
her
manner
how
shall
i
have
the
pluck
to
ask
her
to
marry
me
i
mean
to
do
so
when
she
comes
i
am
going
to
write
the
events
of
these
last
days
down
without
any
comment
i
came
in
to
the
after
alathea
had
arrived
she
was
writing
at
her
desk
in
the
little
salon
i
looked
in
and
asked
her
if
she
would
come
in
and
speak
to
me
then
i
got
to
my
chair
she
entered
obediently
with
the
block
in
her
hand
ready
to
begin
work
will
you
sit
down
please
i
said
indicating
a
chair
where
she
would
face
me
and
the
light
so
that
no
shade
of
her
expression
should
be
lost
upon
me
i
shall
become
quite
an
expert
in
reading
mouths
i
am
obliged
to
study
hers
so
closely
i
felt
less
nervous
than
i
have
ever
felt
when
with
her
i
thought
there
was
the
faintest
shade
of
alertness
in
her
manner
i
am
going
to
say
something
which
will
surprise
you
very
much
miss
sharp
i
began
she
raised
her
head
a
little
i
will
put
the
case
to
you
quite
baldly
i
am
very
rich
as
you
know
i
am
still
horrid
to
look
at
i
am
lonely
and
i
want
a
companion
who
would
play
the
piano
to
me
and
who
would
help
me
to
write
books
and
who
would
travel
with
me
i
can
not
have
any
of
these
simple
things
because
of
the
scandal
people
would
make
so
there
is
only
one
course
open
to
me
that
is
to
go
through
the
marriage
ceremony
miss
sharp
under
those
terms
will
you
marry
me
her
attitude
had
become
tense
her
face
did
not
flush
it
became
very
pale
she
remained
perfectly
silent
for
a
moment
i
felt
just
the
same
as
i
used
to
do
before
going
over
the
top
a
queer
kind
of
excitement
a
wonder
if
i
come
through
or
not
as
she
did
not
answer
i
went
on
i
would
not
expect
anything
from
you
except
a
certain
amount
of
your
company
there
would
not
be
any
question
of
living
with
me
as
a
wife
i
would
promise
even
to
keep
in
check
that
side
which
you
once
saw
and
which
i
was
so
sorry
about
i
would
settle
lots
of
money
on
you
and
give
anything
to
your
family
you
might
wish
i
would
not
bother
you
you
would
be
quite
free
only
i
would
like
you
to
take
interest
in
my
work
in
a
way
and
to
play
to
me
even
if
you
would
not
talk
to
me
my
voice
broke
a
little
at
the
end
of
this
i
was
conscious
of
it
and
of
how
weak
it
was
of
me
her
hands
clasped
together
suddenly
and
she
appeared
as
though
she
was
going
to
speak
then
remained
silent
wo
you
answer
me
at
all
i
pleaded
it
is
such
a
strange
proposal
i
would
wish
to
refuse
it
at
once
it
is
quite
bald
i
know
i
interrupted
quickly
i
want
to
buy
you
that
is
all
you
can
name
the
price
i
know
if
you
consented
it
would
merely
be
for
the
same
reason
which
makes
you
work
i
presume
it
is
for
your
family
not
for
yourself
therefore
i
am
counting
upon
that
to
influence
you
whatever
you
would
want
for
your
family
i
should
be
delighted
to
give
you
she
twisted
her
locked
hands
the
first
sign
of
real
emotion
i
have
seen
in
her
you
would
marry
me
without
knowing
anything
about
me
it
is
very
strange
yes
i
think
you
are
extremely
intelligent
if
you
would
consent
to
talk
to
me
sometimes
i
want
to
go
into
parliament
when
i
am
patched
up
and
more
decent
looking
and
i
believe
you
would
be
of
the
greatest
help
to
me
you
mean
the
whole
thing
simply
as
a
business
arrangement
i
have
already
stated
that
she
started
to
her
feet
the
bargain
i
went
on
would
be
quite
a
fair
one
i
am
offering
to
buy
a
thing
which
is
not
for
sale
therefore
i
am
willing
to
pay
whatever
would
tempt
the
owner
to
part
with
it
i
am
not
mixing
up
any
sentiment
in
the
affair
i
want
the
brain
of
you
for
my
scheme
of
life
and
the
laws
of
the
quaintly
civilized
society
to
which
we
belong
do
not
permit
me
to
hire
it
i
must
buy
it
outright
i
put
it
to
you
net
is
there
any
way
we
can
effect
this
deal
her
lips
were
quivering
you
would
say
this
no
matter
what
you
might
hear
of
my
family
i
am
quite
unconcerned
as
to
their
history
i
have
observed
you
and
you
possess
all
the
qualities
which
i
want
in
the
partner
who
can
help
me
to
live
my
new
life
for
me
you
are
just
a
personality
thus
i
lied
valiantly
not
a
woman
can
i
believe
you
she
asked
a
little
breathlessly
you
are
thinking
of
that
day
when
i
kissed
you
her
lips
told
me
by
their
sudden
drawing
in
that
she
was
agitated
well
i
expect
really
that
you
know
men
well
enough
miss
sharp
to
know
that
they
have
sudden
temptations
but
that
a
strong
will
can
overcome
them
i
was
very
much
moved
about
your
grief
that
afternoon
and
the
suppressed
emotion
and
the
exasperation
you
had
caused
me
unbalanced
me
i
am
quite
unlikely
ever
to
feel
again
if
you
will
marry
me
i
will
give
you
my
word
i
will
never
touch
you
or
expect
anything
of
you
except
what
you
agree
to
give
in
the
bargain
you
can
lead
your
own
life
and
i
can
lead
mine
i
felt
suddenly
that
these
last
words
were
not
very
wise
for
they
aroused
in
her
mind
the
thought
that
i
should
go
on
having
friends
like
suzette
i
hastened
to
add
you
will
have
my
deepest
respect
and
as
my
wife
shall
be
treated
with
every
courtesy
and
honour
she
sat
down
again
and
raised
her
hands
to
her
eyes
as
though
to
remove
her
glasses
and
then
remembered
and
dropped
them
i
see
that
you
would
rather
not
answer
miss
sharp
you
might
prefer
to
go
now
and
think
about
it
thank
you
she
turned
and
walked
back
into
the
little
salon
without
a
word
more
and
when
she
went
i
closed
my
eye
exhausted
with
the
great
strain
but
i
did
not
feel
altogether
hopeless
until
burton
came
in
to
tell
me
lunch
was
ready
and
said
that
alathea
had
gone
the
young
lady
said
as
how
she
would
not
be
back
she
expected
and
she
took
her
own
pens
and
things
in
her
bag
she
was
as
white
as
a
lily
give
you
my
word
sir
nicholas
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
felt
a
little
faint
then
had
i
overstepped
the
mark
and
should
i
never
see
her
again
a
whole
party
of
the
fluffies
were
coming
to
dinner
and
we
were
to
have
a
very
gay
evening
i
ordered
my
one
horse
victoria
and
went
for
a
drive
in
the
to
calm
myself
and
the
trees
with
their
early
autumn
tints
seemed
to
mock
at
me
i
could
see
too
much
beauty
in
them
and
it
hurt
everything
hurt
this
was
certainly
the
worst
afternoon
i
have
had
to
bear
since
i
came
to
on
land
near
langemarke
but
i
suppose
at
dinner
i
played
the
game
for
coralie
and
the
rest
congratulated
me
getting
quite
well
nicholas
and
of
a
we
played
poker
afterwards
and
the
stakes
were
high
and
i
was
the
winner
the
whole
time
until
i
could
see
anxiety
creep
into
more
than
one
eye
pair
of
eyes
i
have
got
so
accustomed
to
writing
of
eyes
in
the
singular
that
i
forget
we
had
quantities
of
champagne
and
some
exotic
musicians
maurice
had
procured
for
me
and
a
nude
hindoo
dancer
everyone
went
more
or
less
mad
they
left
about
four
in
the
morning
all
rather
drunk
if
one
must
write
it
but
the
more
i
had
drunk
the
more
hideously
sober
and
filled
with
anguish
i
seemed
to
become
until
when
i
had
called
the
last
cheery
and
was
at
last
alone
in
my
bed
i
felt
as
if
the
end
had
come
and
that
death
would
be
the
next
and
only
good
thing
which
could
happen
to
me
i
have
never
before
had
this
strange
detached
sense
in
such
measure
as
this
night
as
of
a
hungry
agonized
spirit
standing
outside
its
wretched
body
and
watching
its
feeble
movements
conscious
of
their
futility
conscious
of
being
chained
to
the
miserable
thing
and
only
knowing
rebellion
and
agony
burton
gave
me
a
sleeping
draught
and
i
slept
far
into
the
next
day
to
awake
more
unhappy
than
ever
obsessed
with
and
degradation
in
the
afternoon
i
received
a
note
from
maurice
telling
me
that
he
had
inadvertently
heard
that
a
fellow
in
the
american
red
cross
had
seen
miss
sharp
passport
when
she
had
been
sent
down
to
brest
for
them
and
the
name
on
it
was
alathea
bulteel
sharp
and
judging
that
the
second
name
sounded
as
if
it
might
be
a
english
one
he
hastened
to
tell
me
in
case
it
should
be
a
clue
i
could
not
think
where
i
had
heard
it
before
or
with
what
memory
it
was
connecting
in
my
brain
i
had
a
feeling
it
was
something
to
do
with
george
harcourt
i
puzzled
for
a
while
and
then
i
looked
back
over
the
pages
of
my
journal
and
there
found
what
i
had
written
of
his
conversation
bobby
bulteel
hartelford
brother
cheating
at
cards
and
married
to
lady
hilda
marchant
of
course
the
whole
thing
became
plain
to
me
this
would
account
for
everything
i
hobbled
up
and
got
down
the
peerage
i
turned
to
the
hartelford
title
and
noted
the
brothers
the
john
sinclair
charles
henry
and
robert
edgar
this
last
must
be
bobby
then
i
read
the
usual
things
educated
at
eton
and
christchurch
etc
left
the
guards
in
married
in
lady
hilda
farwell
only
daughter
of
the
marquess
of
braxted
title
extinct
and
divorced
wife
of
william
marchant
esquire
issue
alathea
born
john
robert
born
and
hilda
born
so
the
whole
tragic
story
seemed
to
unfold
itself
before
me
alathea
is
the
child
of
that
great
love
and
sacrifice
of
her
mother
i
read
again
the
words
george
had
used
she
adored
the
fellow
who
had
every
charm
all
the
world
might
cast
him
out
but
that
one
faithful
woman
gave
up
home
and
name
and
honour
to
follow
him
in
his
disgrace
that
was
love
indeed
however
misplaced
i
looked
again
at
the
dates
and
made
a
calculation
of
the
time
divorces
took
then
and
i
saw
that
my
little
darling
girl
could
only
have
escaped
illegitimacy
by
perhaps
a
few
hours
what
had
her
life
been
i
pictured
it
they
must
have
hidden
diminished
heads
in
hole
and
corner
places
during
the
dreary
years
such
a
man
as
bobby
bulteel
must
have
been
as
george
said
a
weakling
the
hartlefords
were
poor
as
church
mice
and
were
not
likely
to
assist
a
scapegrace
who
had
dishonoured
them
i
remembered
hearing
that
on
the
old
lord
braxted
death
years
ago
braxted
was
sold
to
the
ironfounders
from
leeds
no
doubt
the
old
man
had
cut
his
daughter
off
without
the
traditional
shilling
but
even
so
some
hundreds
a
year
must
have
been
theirs
what
then
did
the
poverty
of
alathea
suggest
that
some
constant
drain
must
be
going
on
all
the
time
could
the
scapegrace
still
be
a
gambler
and
that
could
account
for
it
this
seemed
the
most
probable
explanation
then
all
over
me
there
rushed
a
mad
worship
for
my
little
love
her
splendid
unselfishness
her
noble
her
dignity
her
serenity
i
could
have
kissed
the
ground
under
her
feet
i
made
burton
spend
untold
time
telephoning
to
the
embassy
and
then
to
versailles
to
colonel
harcourt
would
he
not
dine
with
me
he
was
sorry
he
was
engaged
but
he
would
lunch
the
next
day
then
when
the
long
evening
was
in
front
of
me
alone
i
could
hardly
bear
it
and
driven
to
desperation
at
last
when
burton
was
undressing
me
i
said
to
him
did
you
ever
know
anything
of
the
hartlefords
burton
bulteel
is
the
family
name
ca
say
as
i
did
personally
sir
nicholas
he
answered
but
of
course
when
i
was
a
young
boy
taking
my
first
place
before
i
came
to
your
father
sir
guy
at
her
grace
of
wiltshire
i
could
not
help
hearing
of
the
scandal
about
the
cheating
at
cards
the
whole
nobility
and
gentry
was
put
to
about
it
and
nothing
else
was
talked
of
at
dinner
try
and
tell
me
what
you
remember
of
the
story
so
burton
held
forth
in
his
own
way
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
had
been
no
possible
doubt
of
the
crime
it
was
the
week
after
the
derby
and
bulteel
had
lost
heavily
it
was
said
he
was
caught
and
got
off
abroad
that
night
and
the
matter
would
have
been
hushed
up
probably
but
for
the
added
sensation
of
lady
hilda
elopement
with
him
that
set
society
by
the
ears
and
the
thing
was
the
thrill
of
the
season
marchant
had
been
all
by
it
and
delayed
the
divorce
so
that
as
far
as
burton
could
remember
captain
bulteel
could
not
marry
lady
hilda
for
more
than
a
year
afterwards
all
this
coincided
with
what
i
already
knew
lord
braxted
too
took
on
fearful
and
died
of
a
broken
heart
it
was
said
leaving
every
cent
to
charity
the
entail
had
been
cut
in
the
generation
before
and
the
title
became
extinct
at
his
death
i
did
not
tell
burton
then
of
my
discovery
and
lay
long
hours
in
the
dark
thinking
and
thinking
what
did
the
duchesse
attitude
mean
in
the
eyes
of
the
duchesse
de
adelaide
de
mont
orgeuil
to
cheat
at
cards
would
be
the
worst
of
all
the
cardinal
sins
such
a
man
as
bobby
bulteel
must
be
separated
from
his
kind
she
knew
lady
hilda
probably
the
duchesse
often
stayed
in
england
with
my
mother
and
she
probably
felt
a
disapproving
pity
for
the
poor
lady
the
great
charity
of
her
mind
would
be
touched
by
suffering
if
the
suffering
was
apparent
and
perhaps
she
had
some
affection
for
the
girl
alathea
but
no
affection
could
bridge
the
gulf
which
separated
the
child
of
an
outcast
from
her
world
the
sins
of
the
father
would
inevitably
be
visited
upon
the
children
by
an
unwritten
law
and
although
she
might
love
alathea
herself
she
could
not
countenance
her
union
with
me
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
had
cheated
at
cards
should
go
into
a
convent
i
instinctively
felt
somehow
that
this
would
be
her
viewpoint
does
alathea
know
this
tragedy
about
her
father
has
she
had
to
live
always
under
this
curse
oh
the
pity
of
it
all
morning
found
me
more
restless
and
miserable
than
i
have
ever
been
and
it
brought
no
sign
of
my
love
xviii
george
harcourt
was
called
suddenly
to
rome
that
morning
and
so
even
hearing
him
talk
further
about
the
bulteels
was
denied
me
for
the
time
i
passed
some
days
of
the
cruelest
unrest
there
was
no
sign
of
alathea
i
allowed
maurice
to
drag
me
out
into
the
world
and
spent
my
evenings
among
my
kind
a
number
of
my
old
pals
have
been
killed
lately
such
an
irony
when
the
war
seems
to
be
drawing
to
a
close
there
is
still
an
atmosphere
of
tension
and
unrestfulness
in
the
air
though
after
an
awful
week
george
harcourt
came
back
and
dropped
in
to
see
me
i
opened
fire
at
once
and
asked
him
to
tell
me
all
that
he
knew
of
the
bulteels
especially
his
old
brother
officer
bobby
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
asking
george
i
said
very
curious
your
speaking
of
them
nicholas
because
there
has
just
been
the
devil
of
a
fuss
in
the
french
foreign
legion
about
that
infernal
blackguard
it
came
to
my
knowledge
in
my
work
has
he
been
cheating
at
cards
again
george
nodded
tell
me
from
the
beginning
so
he
started
many
of
the
bits
i
already
knew
lady
hilda
had
been
a
great
friend
of
his
and
he
dwelt
upon
the
life
of
suffering
she
had
had
there
were
a
few
years
of
frantic
love
and
some
sort
of
happiness
i
expect
and
then
funds
began
to
give
out
and
bobbie
insane
desire
to
gamble
led
him
into
the
shadiest
society
at
and
nice
and
other
warm
spots
poor
hilda
used
to
go
about
with
him
then
in
a
shamed
defiant
way
running
from
any
old
friend
or
staring
over
his
head
i
happened
upon
them
once
or
twice
in
my
wanderings
then
i
lost
sight
of
them
for
some
years
and
the
next
thing
was
someone
told
me
the
poor
woman
had
broken
down
and
was
a
nervous
wreck
and
two
children
had
been
born
in
quick
succession
when
the
first
one
was
about
eleven
years
old
and
the
whole
family
were
in
miserable
straits
i
think
relations
paid
up
that
time
with
the
understanding
that
never
again
were
they
to
be
applied
to
and
since
then
i
have
heard
nothing
until
the
other
day
it
came
to
my
ears
that
the
eldest
girl
she
must
be
over
twenty
now
was
supporting
the
entire
family
one
of
the
children
died
lately
and
now
bobby
has
put
the
cap
on
it
i
am
sorry
for
them
but
bobby
is
impossible
oh
my
poor
little
girl
what
a
life
how
i
longed
to
take
her
out
of
it
he
went
on
strange
how
certain
instincts
show
themselves
under
every
condition
bobby
was
no
physical
coward
and
to
talk
to
and
mix
with
casually
the
most
perfect
gentleman
you
ever
met
awfully
well
read
and
a
topper
at
classics
and
history
and
sang
like
a
bird
he
had
the
grand
manner
and
could
attract
any
woman
though
to
give
the
devil
his
due
i
believe
for
some
years
he
was
faithful
to
lady
hilda
i
should
think
so
i
said
indignantly
after
accepting
her
great
sacrifice
nothing
lasts
my
dear
boy
that
is
not
fundamental
bobby
was
a
rotter
through
and
through
and
so
he
could
even
behave
decently
to
the
woman
who
had
given
up
everything
for
him
once
her
charm
went
but
that
something
in
human
beings
which
is
unaccountable
when
they
are
well
bred
made
him
join
the
french
foreign
legion
immediately
war
broke
out
and
behave
with
great
gallantry
what
brought
on
the
last
episode
he
was
probably
bored
in
the
dull
post
where
he
was
with
not
much
fighting
to
do
lately
and
resorted
to
his
old
game
to
cover
up
losses
which
he
could
not
pay
and
had
the
bad
luck
to
be
caught
for
the
second
time
i
told
you
he
was
a
fool
and
did
not
know
how
to
calculate
the
price
of
his
follies
when
did
you
hear
of
this
only
last
night
on
my
return
and
there
will
be
a
disgusting
scandal
and
the
old
story
will
be
raked
up
and
it
is
pretty
beastly
for
englishmen
can
money
keep
it
quiet
george
i
expect
so
but
who
would
be
fool
enough
to
pay
for
such
a
fellow
i
would
and
will
if
you
can
manage
it
without
letting
my
name
appear
my
dear
boy
how
does
it
interest
you
why
should
you
do
such
a
quixotic
thing
it
is
thousand
francs
only
thousand
francs
i
give
you
the
cheque
this
minute
george
if
you
can
in
your
own
way
free
the
poor
devil
but
nicholas
you
must
be
mad
my
dear
boy
or
you
have
some
strong
motive
i
do
not
know
of
yes
i
have
i
want
this
chap
freed
from
disaster
not
for
his
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
the
family
what
must
that
poor
lady
have
gone
through
and
that
poor
girl
george
looked
at
me
with
his
whimsical
cynical
eye
it
awfully
decent
of
you
nicholas
was
all
he
said
though
and
i
reached
for
my
and
wrote
a
cheque
for
thirty
thousand
francs
with
my
stylo
you
may
need
the
extra
five
thousand
george
to
make
sure
of
the
thing
and
i
count
on
you
to
patch
it
up
as
soon
as
you
can
he
left
after
that
promising
to
see
into
the
affair
at
once
and
telephone
me
the
result
and
when
he
had
gone
i
tried
to
think
over
what
it
all
means
alathea
did
not
know
of
this
when
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
last
week
she
must
never
know
that
i
am
paying
even
if
that
makes
matters
easy
enough
for
her
to
refuse
me
the
reason
of
her
long
silence
is
because
this
fresh
trouble
has
fallen
upon
them
i
am
sure
i
feel
so
awfully
not
being
able
to
comfort
her
the
whole
burden
upon
those
young
just
as
i
wrote
that
yesterday
burton
came
in
to
say
that
miss
sharp
was
in
the
little
salon
and
wished
to
see
me
and
i
sent
him
to
pray
her
to
come
in
i
rose
from
my
chair
to
bow
to
her
when
she
entered
she
never
shakes
hands
i
was
awfully
pained
to
see
the
change
in
her
her
poor
little
white
face
was
thin
and
woebegone
and
even
her
lips
pale
and
her
air
was
not
so
proud
as
usual
wo
you
sit
down
i
said
with
whatever
of
homage
i
could
put
into
my
voice
she
was
so
humbled
and
miserable
that
i
knew
she
would
even
have
taken
off
her
glasses
if
i
had
asked
her
to
but
of
course
i
would
not
do
that
she
seemed
to
find
it
hard
to
begin
i
felt
troubled
for
her
and
started
i
am
awfully
glad
that
you
have
come
back
she
locked
her
hands
together
in
the
shabby
black
suede
gloves
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
if
you
will
give
me
thousand
francs
this
afternoon
i
will
accept
your
offer
and
will
marry
you
i
held
out
my
hand
in
my
infinite
joy
but
i
tried
to
control
all
other
exhibition
of
emotion
that
is
awfully
good
of
you
i
ca
say
how
i
thank
you
i
said
in
a
voice
which
sounded
quite
stern
of
course
i
will
give
you
anything
in
the
world
you
want
and
again
i
reached
for
my
and
wrote
a
cheque
for
fifty
thousand
and
handed
it
to
her
she
looked
at
it
and
went
crimson
i
do
not
want
all
that
thousand
is
enough
that
is
the
price
of
the
bargain
i
would
not
let
this
hurt
me
since
you
have
consented
to
marry
me
i
have
the
right
to
give
you
what
i
please
you
may
need
more
than
you
have
suggested
and
i
want
everything
to
be
smooth
and
as
you
would
wish
she
trembled
all
over
i
i
can
not
argue
now
i
must
go
at
once
but
i
will
think
over
what
i
must
say
about
it
if
you
are
going
to
be
my
wife
you
must
know
that
all
that
is
mine
will
be
yours
so
how
can
a
few
thousand
francs
more
or
less
now
make
any
difference
though
if
you
have
any
feeling
concerning
it
you
can
pay
me
back
out
of
your
first
month
dress
allowance
and
i
tried
to
smile
she
started
to
her
feet
when
shall
i
see
you
again
i
pleaded
in
two
days
when
will
you
marry
me
whenever
you
arrange
must
you
go
now
yes
i
must
i
am
grateful
for
your
generosity
i
will
fulfill
my
side
of
the
bargain
and
i
mine
i
tried
to
rise
and
she
handed
me
my
crutch
and
then
went
towards
the
door
there
she
turned
i
will
come
on
friday
at
ten
as
usual
and
she
bowed
and
left
me
what
a
remarkable
way
to
become
an
engaged
man
but
only
joy
filled
me
at
that
moment
i
wanted
to
shout
and
sing
and
thank
god
alathea
will
be
mine
and
surely
it
will
only
be
a
question
of
time
before
i
can
make
her
love
me
my
little
girl
i
rang
for
burton
i
must
have
rung
vigorously
for
he
came
in
hurriedly
burton
i
said
congratulate
me
my
old
friend
miss
sharp
has
promised
to
marry
me
for
once
burton
imperturbability
deserted
him
he
almost
staggered
and
put
his
hand
to
his
head
god
bless
my
soul
sir
nicholas
he
gasped
and
then
went
on
beg
pardon
sir
but
that
is
the
best
piece
of
news
i
ever
did
hear
in
my
life
and
his
dear
old
eyes
were
full
of
tears
while
he
blew
his
nose
vigorously
it
will
be
a
very
quiet
wedding
burton
we
shall
have
it
at
the
consulate
and
i
suppose
at
the
church
in
the
if
miss
sharp
is
a
protestant
i
have
never
asked
her
the
wedding
do
so
much
matter
sir
nicholas
it
is
having
the
young
lady
always
here
to
look
after
you
without
her
glasses
burton
as
you
say
sir
without
them
horn
things
and
there
was
a
world
of
understanding
in
his
faithful
eyes
he
left
the
room
presently
with
the
walk
of
a
boy
so
elated
was
he
and
i
was
left
alone
thrilling
in
every
nerve
with
triumph
how
i
long
for
friday
i
can
not
possibly
say
in
the
afternoon
maurice
and
alwood
chester
and
madame
de
clerté
came
to
see
me
and
all
exclaimed
at
my
improved
appearance
why
you
look
like
a
million
dollars
nicholas
alwood
said
what
is
up
old
bird
i
am
getting
well
that
is
all
we
are
going
to
have
a
party
on
sunday
to
introduce
you
to
the
loveliest
young
girl
in
paris
solonge
announced
the
daughter
of
a
friend
of
mine
without
a
great
dot
but
that
does
not
matter
for
you
nicholas
we
think
that
you
should
marry
and
marry
a
fille
that
is
sweet
of
you
i
have
shown
how
i
appreciate
young
girls
have
not
i
for
that
no
she
laughed
but
the
time
has
come
i
felt
amused
what
will
alathea
think
of
these
my
friends
solonge
is
the
best
of
them
maurice
had
an
air
of
anxiety
underneath
his
watchful
friendliness
fine
enough
to
atmospheres
or
whatever
it
is
that
comes
from
people
not
in
words
he
felt
that
some
great
change
had
taken
place
in
me
and
he
was
not
sure
what
aspect
it
would
have
in
regard
to
himself
he
came
back
after
he
had
seen
madame
de
clerté
to
her
coupé
she
has
essence
also
now
and
his
rather
ridiculous
kindly
effeminate
little
dark
face
was
appealing
bien
mon
ami
he
said
bien
there
is
something
nicholas
what
was
the
clue
of
any
use
to
you
yes
thank
you
a
thousand
times
maurice
i
could
trace
the
whole
thing
miss
sharp
comes
of
a
very
distinguished
family
which
i
know
all
about
her
uncle
is
a
miserable
earl
that
is
respectable
enough
especially
a
tenth
earl
and
her
maternal
grandfather
was
a
mon
vieux
quite
true
maurice
was
duly
interested
you
were
right
then
about
the
breeding
it
always
does
show
i
had
difficulty
in
not
telling
him
my
news
but
i
thought
it
wiser
to
remain
silent
until
after
friday
friday
day
of
days
maurice
suspected
that
there
was
something
beyond
in
all
this
and
was
not
sure
which
course
would
be
the
best
to
pursue
one
of
sympathy
or
unconsciousness
he
decided
upon
the
latter
and
presently
left
me
then
i
telephoned
to
cartier
to
have
some
rings
sent
up
to
look
at
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
must
be
very
discreet
about
giving
alathea
presents
or
she
will
be
resentful
and
even
suspect
that
my
bargain
is
not
entirely
a
business
one
i
am
afraid
i
seemed
a
little
too
pleased
at
our
interview
i
must
be
indifferently
aloof
on
friday
i
suppose
i
had
better
not
give
her
my
mother
pearls
until
after
the
ceremony
i
wonder
if
there
will
be
a
fuss
when
i
suggest
her
going
to
the
de
la
for
clothes
i
apprehend
that
there
will
be
a
stubborn
resistance
to
almost
everything
i
would
wish
to
do
how
will
the
duchesse
take
it
probably
philosophically
once
it
is
an
accomplished
fact
at
that
moment
burton
brought
me
in
a
note
from
that
very
lady
i
opened
it
eagerly
and
its
contents
made
me
smile
the
duchesse
wrote
to
remind
me
of
a
request
i
once
made
her
that
if
a
certain
family
were
in
trouble
that
i
would
assist
them
to
any
amount
thousand
francs
were
now
absolutely
necessary
on
the
moment
if
i
could
send
them
to
her
by
bearer
i
would
know
that
i
was
doing
a
good
deed
for
the
third
time
that
day
i
reached
for
my
and
wrote
a
cheque
but
for
only
the
sum
asked
on
this
occasion
and
then
when
burton
had
brought
me
note
paper
i
sent
a
little
word
with
it
to
the
duchesse
and
when
i
was
alone
again
i
laughed
aloud
three
people
determined
upon
it
must
surely
save
the
scapegrace
i
wonder
which
of
the
three
will
get
there
first
i
would
not
go
out
anywhere
to
dinner
i
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
over
the
whole
strange
turn
of
fate
do
strong
desires
influence
events
or
are
all
these
things
settled
beforehand
or
is
there
something
in
reincarnation
which
alathea
believes
in
and
the
actions
of
one
life
cause
that
which
looks
like
fate
in
the
next
we
shall
have
many
talks
on
this
subject
i
hope
i
wonder
how
long
it
will
take
for
my
little
love
to
come
voluntarily
into
my
arms
xix
i
wonder
how
long
i
shall
go
on
writing
in
this
journal
i
suppose
once
i
should
be
happy
it
would
not
be
necessary
well
the
moment
has
not
yet
come
in
spite
of
my
being
the
of
the
woman
i
desire
at
ten
i
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
and
i
was
thinking
of
that
other
time
when
i
waited
in
anxiety
in
case
she
did
not
return
at
all
i
was
very
excited
but
it
was
more
the
exhilaration
i
used
to
feel
when
we
were
going
to
have
some
stunning
marauding
expeditions
over
land
the
old
zest
was
in
my
veins
i
heard
alathea
ring
and
after
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
she
came
into
the
room
i
believed
that
her
anxieties
must
be
assuaged
because
george
harcourt
had
telephoned
late
on
thursday
night
to
say
that
he
had
been
successful
and
that
he
had
four
thousand
francs
to
hand
back
to
me
the
affair
having
been
concluded
for
thousand
so
what
was
my
surprise
to
see
alathea
face
below
her
glasses
more
woebegone
than
ever
at
first
it
gave
me
a
stab
of
pain
does
she
really
hate
me
so
she
did
not
mention
the
money
so
i
wonder
if
it
is
that
she
does
not
yet
know
her
father
is
cleared
i
bowed
as
coldly
as
i
used
always
to
do
and
she
asked
me
if
i
had
a
chapter
ready
for
her
to
type
i
answered
that
i
had
not
because
i
had
been
too
busy
with
other
things
to
have
composed
anything
i
think
we
had
better
discuss
the
necessary
arrangements
for
our
marriage
before
we
can
settle
down
to
our
old
work
i
said
very
well
i
shall
have
to
have
your
full
name
and
your
father
and
mother
and
all
that
you
know
to
make
it
legal
my
lawyer
will
attend
to
all
the
formalities
they
are
quite
considerable
i
believe
he
arrives
from
london
on
monday
i
got
him
a
passport
by
pulling
a
lot
of
strings
she
actually
trembled
it
seemed
as
if
the
idea
of
all
this
had
not
come
to
her
some
of
the
value
of
her
sacrifice
would
be
diminished
if
the
family
skeleton
should
be
laid
bare
i
could
see
she
felt
so
i
reassured
her
believe
me
i
do
not
wish
you
to
tell
me
anything
about
your
family
as
long
as
you
can
give
just
sufficient
facts
to
satisfy
the
law
i
have
no
curiosity
to
see
them
unless
i
can
be
of
use
thank
you
i
think
a
fortnight
is
the
quickest
that
everything
can
be
settled
will
you
marry
me
on
the
seventh
of
november
miss
sharp
yes
do
you
care
for
the
church
ceremony
or
will
the
one
at
the
consulate
do
i
should
think
that
would
be
quite
enough
for
us
the
ring
cases
were
all
lying
upon
the
table
by
me
i
pointed
to
them
i
wonder
if
you
would
choose
an
engagement
ring
and
i
began
opening
the
lids
it
is
customary
you
know
i
went
on
as
she
started
reluctantly
i
intended
to
be
firm
with
her
in
all
the
points
where
i
had
rights
do
you
think
it
is
a
little
ridiculous
she
asked
a
ring
for
a
mere
business
arrangement
i
would
not
allow
myself
to
be
hurt
but
i
was
conscious
that
i
felt
a
little
angry
you
would
prefer
not
to
choose
a
ring
then
very
well
i
will
decide
for
you
and
i
took
up
one
really
magnificent
single
stone
diamond
set
as
only
cartier
can
set
stones
this
is
the
last
thing
in
modernity
and
i
handed
it
to
her
a
hard
white
diamond
of
egregious
size
it
can
not
fail
to
be
a
reminder
of
our
hard
business
bargain
and
i
shall
ask
you
to
be
good
enough
to
wear
it
i
suppose
she
saw
that
i
was
not
pleased
for
she
drew
in
her
lips
a
little
but
she
took
the
ring
her
hands
seemed
very
restless
as
she
held
it
they
were
certainly
not
nearly
so
red
as
they
formerly
were
am
i
to
put
it
on
now
please
she
did
so
only
she
put
it
on
her
right
third
finger
her
cheeks
growing
pink
why
do
you
do
that
i
asked
what
put
the
ring
on
the
wrong
hand
she
changed
it
reluctantly
then
she
burst
out
i
suppose
i
ought
to
thank
you
for
such
a
very
splendid
gift
but
i
ca
because
i
would
much
rather
not
have
it
please
do
let
us
keep
to
business
in
every
way
and
please
do
give
me
any
more
presents
i
am
going
to
be
just
your
secretary
with
my
wages
commuted
into
some
lump
sum
i
suppose
i
felt
more
angry
and
i
think
she
saw
it
i
remained
silent
which
forced
her
to
speak
do
you
intend
that
i
shall
live
here
in
the
flat
of
course
will
you
please
choose
which
of
the
two
guest
rooms
you
would
prefer
they
both
have
bathrooms
and
you
will
have
the
decoration
as
you
wish
silence
my
exasperation
augmented
will
you
also
please
engage
a
maid
and
go
and
order
every
sort
of
clothes
which
you
ought
to
have
i
know
by
the
way
you
were
dressed
when
i
saw
you
in
the
that
sunday
that
your
taste
is
perfect
she
stiffened
as
i
spoke
it
was
quite
plain
to
be
seen
that
she
loathed
taking
anything
from
me
but
i
had
no
intention
of
ceding
a
single
point
where
i
had
the
right
to
impose
my
will
you
see
you
will
be
known
as
my
wife
therefore
you
must
dress
according
to
the
position
and
have
everything
my
mother
used
to
have
otherwise
people
would
not
respect
you
and
only
think
that
you
were
invidiously
placed
her
cheeks
flamed
again
at
the
last
words
it
is
difficult
to
picture
it
all
she
said
tell
me
exactly
what
you
expect
of
me
daily
i
expect
that
when
you
have
breakfasted
in
your
room
if
you
wish
that
you
will
come
and
talk
to
me
perhaps
do
a
little
writing
or
go
out
to
drive
or
what
you
wish
and
that
we
shall
lunch
and
in
the
afternoon
do
whatever
turns
up
you
will
want
to
go
out
and
see
your
friends
and
do
what
you
please
and
perhaps
you
will
play
to
me
as
often
as
you
feel
inclined
and
after
dinner
we
can
go
to
the
theatre
or
read
or
do
whatever
you
like
and
as
soon
as
my
treatments
with
these
doctors
are
concluded
and
i
have
my
new
leg
and
eye
and
we
shall
hope
war
is
finished
we
can
travel
or
go
back
to
england
and
then
i
shall
begin
taking
up
a
political
career
and
i
shall
hope
you
will
take
a
real
interest
in
that
and
help
me
as
though
i
were
your
brother
very
well
you
will
order
the
clothes
yes
she
was
subdued
now
the
programme
was
not
very
formidable
except
that
it
contained
daily
companionship
with
me
have
you
told
the
duchesse
de
yet
that
we
are
engaged
i
asked
after
a
moment
pause
discomfort
grew
in
her
manner
no
do
you
think
that
she
will
not
approve
of
the
marriage
she
may
not
perhaps
you
would
rather
that
i
told
her
as
you
please
i
want
you
to
understand
something
quite
clearly
alathea
she
started
when
i
said
her
name
and
that
is
that
i
expect
you
to
treat
me
with
confidence
and
tell
me
anything
which
you
think
that
i
ought
to
know
so
that
we
neither
of
us
can
be
put
in
a
false
position
beyond
that
believe
me
i
have
no
curiosity
i
desire
a
companionship
of
brain
and
a
sort
of
permanent
secretary
who
does
not
feel
hostile
all
the
time
that
is
all
i
could
see
that
she
was
controlling
herself
with
all
her
will
and
that
she
was
overwrought
and
intensely
troubled
i
knew
that
some
barrier
was
between
us
which
i
could
not
at
present
surmount
all
she
said
after
a
minute
was
how
did
you
know
that
my
name
was
i
heard
your
little
sister
call
you
that
the
day
i
saw
you
in
the
i
think
it
a
very
beautiful
name
silence
her
discomfort
seemed
to
come
to
a
climax
for
after
a
little
she
spoke
the
thousand
francs
beyond
the
i
asked
you
for
i
can
not
return
to
you
i
feel
very
much
about
it
and
that
you
should
pay
for
my
clothes
and
give
me
presents
it
is
the
hardest
thing
i
ever
had
to
do
in
my
life
to
take
all
this
do
not
let
it
bother
you
i
am
quite
content
with
the
bargain
perhaps
you
would
rather
go
now
after
we
have
selected
which
room
you
will
have
thank
you
she
gave
me
my
crutch
and
i
led
the
way
and
she
followed
i
knew
instinctively
that
she
would
choose
the
room
which
was
furthest
from
mine
she
did
this
will
do
she
said
immediately
we
entered
it
the
is
not
so
nice
it
only
gets
the
early
morning
sun
i
ventured
to
remark
it
is
quieter
very
well
it
was
rather
arranged
for
a
man
and
is
perhaps
severe
do
you
wish
anything
changed
she
did
not
appear
to
take
any
more
interest
in
it
than
if
it
had
been
a
hotel
room
she
had
given
it
the
merest
glance
although
it
is
quite
a
little
masterpiece
in
its
way
of
william
and
mary
even
the
panelling
being
english
and
of
the
time
and
the
old
rose
silk
window
and
bed
curtains
i
do
want
anything
altered
thank
you
it
seemed
a
strange
moment
to
be
talking
thus
calmly
to
the
woman
who
in
a
fortnight
will
be
my
wife
i
feel
that
a
volcano
is
really
working
under
our
feet
and
that
adds
to
the
excitement
when
we
got
back
to
the
i
offered
to
send
the
carriage
for
her
to
go
and
do
her
shopping
but
she
refused
and
i
thought
it
was
wiser
to
let
her
go
we
shall
have
years
to
talk
in
presently
and
there
is
always
the
danger
of
our
coming
to
an
open
rupture
and
the
bargain
being
off
if
we
see
much
of
one
another
now
she
said
a
little
nervously
and
i
bowed
and
said
and
she
went
from
the
room
and
when
she
had
gone
i
laughed
aloud
and
began
to
analyse
the
situation
george
harcourt
has
paid
the
gambling
debt
therefore
the
fifty
thousand
i
gave
alathea
can
not
have
been
used
for
that
some
fresh
worry
is
perhaps
upon
the
wretched
family
the
obvious
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
go
and
see
the
duchesse
and
yet
i
have
some
strange
sort
of
wish
that
it
should
be
alathea
herself
who
tells
me
everything
and
not
that
she
becomes
aware
by
inference
that
i
must
know
i
feel
that
our
future
happiness
depends
upon
her
giving
up
all
this
stubborn
pride
what
is
at
the
back
of
her
mind
i
do
not
know
that
resentment
and
dislike
of
me
has
only
become
crystallized
since
the
suzette
affair
i
am
sure
she
thinks
that
suzette
is
my
mistress
still
and
this
insults
her
but
she
reasons
that
with
the
bargain
as
it
is
she
has
not
the
smallest
right
to
object
she
is
furious
with
herself
to
think
that
it
should
matter
to
her
that
is
a
thought
why
indeed
should
it
matter
if
she
is
utterly
indifferent
to
me
is
it
possible
can
it
be
that
no
i
dare
not
think
of
it
but
in
any
case
it
will
be
the
most
thrilling
situation
once
she
is
my
wife
i
believe
it
would
be
wisest
for
me
not
to
go
to
the
duchesse
but
simply
to
write
her
a
note
telling
her
of
my
news
then
anything
she
may
tell
me
will
be
gratuitous
i
had
just
finished
doing
this
when
once
again
a
letter
was
brought
in
from
that
lady
and
this
time
it
was
to
thank
me
for
my
cheque
and
to
tell
me
that
it
had
been
the
means
of
preventing
a
most
disagreeable
scandal
and
bringing
peace
to
a
family
sardonic
mirth
overcame
me
so
three
separate
people
seem
to
be
under
the
impression
that
they
have
paid
this
gambler
debts
each
apparently
unaware
that
there
was
anyone
else
in
the
running
it
looks
as
if
bobby
had
wolfed
the
lot
does
alathea
know
and
is
this
the
extra
cause
of
her
worry
i
sent
my
note
back
by
the
duchesse
messenger
who
still
waited
and
went
to
my
luncheon
in
about
an
hour
the
telephone
rang
a
request
from
the
hotel
de
courville
that
i
should
repair
there
immediately
without
fail
her
grace
spoke
herself
burton
said
and
said
it
was
most
important
sir
nicholas
very
well
order
the
carriage
by
the
way
burton
did
you
congratulate
miss
sharp
burton
coughed
i
did
make
so
bold
sir
nicholas
as
to
tell
the
young
lady
how
very
glad
i
was
but
she
took
it
queer
like
she
stiffened
up
and
said
it
was
only
a
business
arrangement
to
be
able
to
write
your
letters
and
do
your
work
without
people
talking
about
it
that
seemed
funny
to
me
so
i
said
nothing
more
burton
it
is
funny
for
the
moment
miss
sharp
is
only
marrying
me
for
some
reason
for
her
family
the
same
one
which
forces
her
to
work
but
i
hope
i
can
make
her
think
differently
about
it
some
day
pardon
the
liberty
i
am
taking
sir
nicholas
but
perhaps
she
like
the
idea
of
and
do
know
she
gone
for
good
that
is
probably
the
case
burton
wise
old
face
expressed
complete
understanding
as
he
left
the
room
and
presently
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
hotel
de
courville
a
sense
of
exhilaration
and
of
excitement
and
joy
in
my
heart
xx
the
duchesse
was
playing
impatiently
with
her
glasses
when
i
was
announced
by
the
servant
of
ninety
her
face
expressed
some
strong
feeling
i
was
not
sure
if
it
was
tinged
with
displeasure
or
no
she
helped
me
to
sit
down
and
then
she
began
at
once
nicholas
explain
yourself
you
tell
me
you
are
engaged
to
your
secretary
so
this
has
been
going
on
all
the
time
and
you
have
not
told
me
i
who
was
your
mother
oldest
friend
dear
duchesse
you
are
mistaken
it
has
only
just
been
settled
no
one
was
more
surprised
at
my
offer
than
miss
sharp
herself
you
know
her
real
name
nicholas
and
her
family
history
you
have
guessed
of
course
from
my
asking
you
for
the
thousand
francs
that
they
were
in
some
difficulty
yes
i
know
alathea
is
the
daughter
of
the
honorable
robert
and
lady
hilda
bulteel
she
has
told
you
all
of
the
story
perhaps
but
you
can
not
know
what
the
money
was
for
because
the
poor
child
does
not
know
it
herself
it
is
more
just
that
i
should
inform
you
since
you
are
going
to
marry
into
the
family
thank
you
duchesse
she
then
began
and
gave
me
a
picture
of
her
old
friendship
with
lady
hilda
and
of
the
dreadful
calamity
which
had
befallen
in
her
going
off
with
bobby
bulteel
it
was
one
of
those
cases
of
mad
love
nicholas
which
fortunately
seem
to
have
died
out
of
the
modern
world
though
for
the
truth
i
must
say
that
one
more
than
joli
i
have
never
met
one
could
not
of
course
acknowledge
them
for
a
crime
like
that
but
i
have
ever
been
fond
of
poor
hilda
and
that
sweet
little
child
she
was
born
here
in
this
hotel
poor
hilda
came
to
me
in
her
great
trouble
and
i
was
in
deep
mourning
myself
then
for
my
husband
the
house
is
large
and
it
could
all
pass
quietly
i
reached
forward
and
took
the
duchesse
hand
and
kissed
it
and
she
went
on
alatheé
is
my
godchild
one
of
my
names
is
alatheé
the
poor
little
one
she
adored
her
father
in
all
those
first
years
they
wandered
much
and
only
came
to
paris
at
intervals
and
each
time
they
came
a
little
poorer
a
little
more
troubled
and
then
after
a
lapse
i
heard
those
two
were
born
at
nice
wretched
little
decadents
when
my
poor
hilda
was
a
mass
of
nerves
and
disillusion
alatheé
was
eleven
then
it
was
when
she
was
about
fourteen
that
she
heard
of
her
crime
she
was
the
gayest
most
sweet
child
before
that
through
all
their
poverty
but
from
that
moment
her
character
was
changed
it
destroyed
something
in
her
spirit
one
must
believe
she
set
firmly
to
education
decided
she
would
be
a
secretary
cultivated
herself
worked
worked
worked
she
worshipped
her
mother
and
resented
immensely
her
father
treatment
of
her
she
must
always
have
had
a
wonderful
character
for
that
yes
and
the
duchesse
paused
a
moment
then
went
on
quite
a
tremendous
character
and
as
bobby
sank
and
poor
hilda
became
more
ill
and
wretched
that
child
has
risen
in
strength
and
supported
them
all
since
the
war
came
they
have
almost
lived
upon
her
earnings
the
father
is
without
conscience
and
of
a
selfishness
unspeakable
his
money
all
went
to
him
for
his
use
and
alatheé
was
left
to
supplement
the
mother
wretched
two
or
three
thousand
francs
a
year
and
now
that
brute
has
again
cheated
at
cards
and
poor
hilda
came
to
me
in
her
great
distress
and
remembering
your
words
nicholas
i
called
upon
you
it
would
have
been
too
cruel
for
the
poor
woman
to
have
had
to
suffer
again
hilda
took
the
money
and
gave
it
to
this
infamous
husband
and
the
affair
was
settled
that
night
alatheé
knows
nothing
about
it
light
was
dawning
upon
me
the
admirable
bobby
has
evidently
played
upon
the
feelings
of
both
wife
and
daughter
duchesse
why
did
you
not
wish
me
to
know
the
real
name
and
would
not
help
me
at
all
about
sharp
wo
you
now
tell
me
your
reason
the
duchesse
shaded
her
eyes
from
the
fire
with
a
and
it
came
between
us
and
i
could
not
see
her
face
but
her
voice
changed
i
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
the
girl
in
your
flat
one
day
i
had
not
understood
with
whom
she
was
working
i
was
not
pleased
about
it
frankly
nicholas
because
one
can
not
help
knowing
of
your
existence
and
your
friends
and
i
feared
your
interest
for
a
secretary
might
be
as
for
them
and
i
disliked
that
my
godchild
should
run
such
a
risk
when
of
the
world
have
to
take
up
menial
positions
they
are
of
course
open
to
such
situations
and
have
to
expect
difficulties
i
wished
to
protect
her
as
well
as
i
could
suddenly
i
saw
myself
and
the
utterly
rotten
life
i
had
led
that
this
my
old
friend
even
could
not
be
sure
of
my
chivalry
i
loathed
the
lax
cheap
honor
of
the
world
and
its
hypocrisy
i
could
not
even
be
indignant
with
the
duchesse
judging
me
from
that
standpoint
she
was
right
but
i
did
tell
her
that
men
had
a
slightly
different
angle
in
looking
upon
such
things
in
england
where
women
worked
and
were
respected
in
all
classes
and
that
the
idea
of
making
love
to
any
secretary
would
never
have
entered
my
head
it
was
the
intelligence
and
the
dignity
of
alathea
herself
which
had
made
me
desire
her
for
a
companion
it
is
well
that
you
are
english
nicholas
no
frenchman
of
family
could
have
married
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
had
cheated
at
cards
even
if
the
girl
was
good
and
splendid
like
alathea
duchesse
for
that
no
my
son
we
have
little
left
but
our
traditions
and
our
names
and
those
things
matter
to
us
no
frankly
i
could
not
have
permitted
the
union
had
you
been
my
son
so
i
had
been
right
in
my
analysis
of
what
would
be
the
bent
of
my
old
friend
mind
you
are
pleased
now
though
dear
duchesse
i
pleaded
it
seems
impossible
from
my
point
and
i
would
not
have
encouraged
it
but
since
it
is
done
i
can
but
wish
my
dear
alatheé
and
you
my
dear
boy
true
happiness
again
i
took
and
kissed
her
kind
hand
in
england
especially
in
this
war
time
questions
are
not
asked
ce
she
can
be
simply
and
not
bulteel
then
it
may
pass
for
the
girl
herself
you
have
a
rare
jewel
nicholas
unselfish
devoted
true
but
the
will
of
the
devil
you
shall
not
be
able
to
turn
her
as
you
wish
if
her
ideas
go
the
other
way
duchesse
the
situation
is
peculiar
there
is
no
question
of
love
in
it
alathea
is
marrying
me
merely
that
she
may
give
money
to
her
family
i
am
marrying
that
i
may
have
a
secretary
without
scandal
we
are
not
going
to
be
really
husband
and
wife
the
duchesse
dropped
her
her
were
whimsical
and
sparkling
she
said
and
never
has
the
delicious
word
conveyed
so
much
meaning
you
believe
that
truly
nicholas
alatheé
is
a
very
pretty
girl
when
properly
dressed
and
without
glasses
as
you
say
without
glasses
which
i
hear
cover
her
fine
eyes
when
in
your
society
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
under
those
terms
and
it
was
only
upon
those
terms
she
accepted
me
the
duchesse
laughed
a
nice
romance
well
my
son
i
wish
you
joy
duchesse
and
i
leaned
forward
do
you
really
think
i
can
make
her
love
me
am
i
too
awful
is
there
a
chance
the
duchesse
patted
my
arm
and
her
face
shone
with
kindliness
of
course
foolish
boy
and
she
broke
into
french
using
the
thee
and
thou
again
affectionately
was
very
handsome
that
which
remained
and
all
would
look
the
same
as
ever
when
the
repairing
should
be
complete
so
very
tall
and
fine
nicholas
and
hair
of
a
thickness
and
what
is
best
of
all
that
air
of
a
great
gentleman
yes
yes
women
will
always
love
thee
eye
leg
do
not
disturb
thyself
do
tell
her
i
love
her
duchesse
i
pleaded
we
have
much
to
learn
of
each
other
if
she
did
not
believe
it
was
a
bargain
equal
on
both
sides
she
would
not
marry
me
at
all
the
duchesse
agreed
about
this
whatever
she
has
promised
she
will
perform
but
why
she
does
not
love
thee
already
i
can
not
tell
she
dislikes
me
she
thinks
i
am
a
rotter
and
i
expect
she
was
right
but
i
shall
not
be
in
the
future
and
then
perhaps
she
will
change
when
i
left
the
hotel
de
courville
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
duchesse
would
receive
my
wife
with
honour
her
world
only
knowing
that
i
had
married
an
english
miss
sharp
i
heard
no
more
of
my
until
next
morning
when
she
telephoned
did
i
wish
her
to
come
that
day
burton
answered
that
i
hoped
she
would
about
eleven
i
intended
to
tell
her
that
i
thought
that
it
might
be
wiser
now
if
she
did
not
come
again
until
the
wedding
as
once
we
were
engaged
i
would
not
allow
her
to
run
the
risk
of
meeting
anyone
and
giving
a
false
impression
i
think
the
strain
would
be
too
great
in
any
case
i
did
not
come
in
to
the
salon
until
she
was
there
and
she
rose
as
i
entered
she
was
whiter
than
ever
and
very
stern
i
have
been
thinking
she
said
before
i
could
speak
that
if
i
promise
to
fulfill
the
bargain
and
live
here
in
the
flat
with
you
going
through
the
ceremony
at
the
consulate
is
quite
unnecessary
your
caprice
of
having
me
for
your
wife
merely
in
name
in
england
may
pass
and
it
seems
ridiculous
to
be
tied
i
am
quite
indifferent
to
what
anyone
thinks
of
me
i
would
prefer
it
like
that
why
i
asked
and
wondered
for
a
moment
what
had
occurred
there
are
so
many
stupid
law
things
if
there
is
a
marriage
and
if
you
have
the
same
from
me
without
surely
you
see
that
it
is
better
i
first
thought
that
it
was
this
fear
of
my
knowing
her
family
history
which
was
at
the
root
of
this
suggestion
but
then
i
remembered
that
she
would
know
that
i
would
hear
it
in
any
case
from
the
duchesse
what
then
could
it
be
i
felt
cruel
i
was
not
going
to
make
things
too
easy
for
her
if
she
has
the
will
of
the
devil
she
has
also
the
pride
if
you
are
indifferent
to
such
an
invidious
position
as
your
new
idea
would
place
us
in
i
am
not
i
do
not
wish
my
friends
to
think
that
i
am
such
a
cad
as
presumably
to
have
taken
advantage
of
your
being
my
secretary
you
wish
to
go
on
with
the
marriage
then
of
course
she
clasped
her
hands
together
suddenly
as
if
she
could
control
herself
no
longer
and
i
thought
of
what
she
had
said
to
burton
about
feeling
that
she
could
not
fight
any
more
i
would
not
allow
myself
to
sympathize
with
her
i
was
longing
in
every
nerve
of
my
being
to
take
her
into
my
arms
and
tell
her
that
i
loved
her
and
knew
everything
but
i
would
not
do
this
i
can
not
let
her
master
me
or
we
shall
never
have
any
peace
i
will
not
tell
her
that
i
love
her
until
her
pride
is
broken
and
i
have
made
her
love
me
and
come
to
me
voluntarily
she
was
silent
i
have
informed
the
duchesse
de
courville
that
we
are
engaged
i
saw
her
yesterday
she
started
perceptibly
she
has
told
you
my
real
name
i
have
known
that
for
some
time
i
thought
i
had
made
it
plain
to
you
that
i
am
not
interested
about
the
subject
we
need
not
mention
it
again
you
have
only
to
talk
to
old
robert
nelson
my
lawyer
when
he
comes
on
monday
he
will
tell
you
the
settlements
i
propose
to
make
and
you
can
discuss
with
him
as
to
whether
or
not
you
think
them
satisfactory
perhaps
you
on
your
side
will
tell
me
what
reason
you
have
strong
enough
to
make
a
girl
of
your
natural
willing
to
take
the
position
of
my
apparent
mistress
she
burst
out
for
a
second
throwing
out
her
hands
then
controlling
herself
no
i
wo
tell
i
will
tell
you
nothing
i
will
just
stick
to
the
bargain
if
i
must
you
have
no
right
to
my
thoughts
only
my
actions
i
bowed
disagreeable
as
she
was
there
was
a
distinctly
pleasant
zest
in
fighting
perhaps
of
your
courtesy
you
will
take
off
those
glasses
now
since
i
am
aware
that
you
only
wear
them
to
conceal
your
eyes
and
not
that
they
are
necessary
for
your
sight
she
flushed
with
annoyance
and
if
i
refuse
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
shall
think
it
very
childish
of
you
with
a
petulance
which
i
had
never
seen
in
her
she
tossed
her
head
i
do
care
at
present
i
will
not
i
frowned
but
did
not
speak
this
will
be
discussed
between
us
later
my
fighting
spirit
is
up
she
obey
me
did
you
order
the
clothes
yesterday
yes
enough
i
hope
yes
well
now
i
have
a
suggestion
to
make
which
i
am
sure
will
please
you
and
that
is
that
you
will
appoint
some
meeting
place
with
nelson
for
tuesday
morning
since
you
do
not
trust
my
good
taste
far
enough
even
to
let
me
know
your
home
address
perhaps
at
the
hotel
de
courville
if
the
duchesse
will
permit
and
that
then
we
do
not
meet
until
the
seventh
of
november
at
the
ceremony
nelson
will
arrange
with
you
all
the
law
of
the
thing
and
what
witnesses
you
must
have
and
everything
and
this
will
save
these
useless
discussions
and
give
you
a
little
breathing
space
this
seemed
to
subdue
her
and
she
agreed
less
defiantly
and
now
i
will
not
detain
you
longer
i
said
stiffly
until
the
seventh
of
november
at
whatever
hour
is
arranged
or
if
we
must
meet
before
at
the
signing
of
the
contract
and
i
bowed
she
bowed
also
and
walked
haughtily
to
the
door
and
left
and
greatly
exhilarated
i
decided
to
go
and
lunch
with
maurice
at
the
ritz
as
i
came
from
the
lift
madame
bizot
daughter
came
out
of
the
concierge
lodge
with
her
baby
and
it
was
making
its
same
little
cooing
gurgling
noises
that
caused
me
so
to
feel
that
time
when
alathea
first
began
to
interest
me
i
stopped
and
spoke
to
the
mother
a
comely
young
woman
and
the
little
creature
put
out
its
tiny
hand
and
clasped
one
of
my
fingers
and
over
me
there
came
a
weird
thrill
shall
i
ever
hear
noises
like
that
and
have
a
son
of
alathea
and
mine
to
take
my
hand
well
the
game
of
her
subjection
is
interesting
enough
anyway
and
rather
ashamed
of
my
emotion
i
went
on
into
the
victoria
and
was
crawled
to
the
ritz
here
i
ran
into
a
fellow
in
the
flying
corps
who
told
me
that
boy
johnnie
had
been
killed
the
night
before
in
his
first
fight
with
a
boche
plane
i
do
not
know
that
any
of
the
tragedies
of
the
war
have
affected
me
more
my
poor
nina
she
really
loved
her
son
i
telegraphed
to
her
at
once
my
fondest
sympathies
and
the
thought
of
her
grief
would
not
leave
me
all
the
way
as
i
am
i
did
not
tell
maurice
of
my
approaching
wedding
i
have
a
plan
that
he
shall
only
know
when
i
ask
him
to
come
to
the
hotel
de
courville
to
be
presented
to
my
wife
the
fluffies
have
returned
from
deauville
and
coralie
and
alice
joined
us
at
luncheon
they
have
the
most
exquisite
new
garments
and
were
full
of
sparkle
and
gaiety
alice
wedding
to
the
rich
neutral
seems
really
to
be
coming
off
her
air
was
one
of
subdued
modesty
and
gentleness
and
when
i
congratulated
her
she
made
the
tenderest
acceptance
of
it
which
would
have
done
justice
to
a
young
virgin
of
the
coralie
met
my
eye
with
her
shrewd
small
ones
and
we
looked
away
after
lunch
we
sat
in
the
hall
for
a
little
maurice
taking
alice
to
try
on
her
clothes
so
coralie
and
i
were
left
alone
you
are
looking
quite
well
now
nicholas
she
whispered
why
do
you
ask
me
to
come
and
dine
with
you
at
your
adorable
flat
alone
you
would
be
bored
with
me
before
the
evening
was
over
arrange
it
and
try
always
there
are
the
others
except
that
night
at
versailles
there
is
an
air
with
you
nicholas
one
has
forgotten
all
about
your
eye
i
have
thought
and
thought
of
you
have
interfered
with
all
my
pleasures
in
life
i
am
going
back
to
england
quite
soon
coralie
wo
you
come
now
to
the
de
la
and
let
me
buy
you
a
little
souvenir
of
all
the
lovely
times
we
have
had
together
in
the
last
year
so
she
came
and
selected
a
gem
of
an
opera
glass
an
opera
glass
is
discreet
it
can
be
accepted
by
anyone
even
a
woman
determined
to
impress
my
mind
with
her
dignity
and
charm
as
coralie
was
attempting
to
do
upon
our
expedition
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
i
should
no
longer
be
just
a
benefit
to
the
three
of
them
but
her
own
especial
property
and
she
is
clever
enough
to
see
that
i
am
in
a
mood
to
admire
dignity
and
discretion
i
spent
a
most
amusing
hour
with
her
enjoying
myself
in
the
spirit
of
watching
a
good
play
at
the
at
about
four
when
we
returned
to
the
ritz
coralie
was
baffled
i
could
see
that
she
was
keener
than
ever
and
beginning
to
be
a
little
worried
and
unsure
of
herself
as
i
drove
back
to
my
flat
taking
a
roundabout
way
through
the
bois
i
mused
and
analysed
things
and
what
is
the
psychological
reason
for
some
presents
being
quite
correct
to
give
and
some
not
it
all
goes
back
to
the
instinct
and
through
what
this
manifests
itself
gifts
which
have
any
relation
to
the
body
to
give
it
pleasure
or
to
decorate
it
are
the
expressions
of
the
sex
relationship
and
so
presumably
the
subconscious
mind
which
only
sees
the
truth
in
everything
only
feels
harmonious
when
these
gifts
are
given
by
either
parents
or
relations
as
a
dower
so
to
speak
or
the
husband
or
prospective
husband
hence
through
the
ages
the
unconscious
relegation
of
certain
presents
as
acceptable
only
from
certain
people
any
present
which
gives
pleasure
to
the
mind
alone
is
the
tribute
of
friendship
but
those
to
touch
the
body
are
presumably
not
i
could
give
coralie
an
opera
glass
as
a
mark
of
my
esteem
but
a
bracelet
which
she
would
wear
on
her
arm
would
have
another
meaning
alathea
resents
every
present
those
for
the
body
because
they
suggest
my
possession
of
her
those
for
the
mind
because
she
feels
no
friendship
for
me
at
all
well
well
what
will
she
do
i
wonder
during
the
fortnight
of
our
engagement
i
feel
that
i
can
afford
to
wait
with
patience
and
certainty
but
the
thought
that
i
do
not
even
know
my
address
and
that
she
is
resentful
and
defiant
and
rebellious
at
everything
and
yet
intends
to
marry
me
on
the
seventh
of
november
is
really
almost
humorous
and
now
it
behooves
me
to
put
my
house
in
order
and
map
out
exactly
what
i
mean
to
do
xxi
the
days
go
slowly
on
my
preparations
are
complete
my
good
friend
nelson
arrived
on
monday
and
took
charge
of
the
affair
he
was
entirely
aware
of
the
bulteel
story
it
was
the
great
scandal
of
years
ago
he
expressed
no
opinion
as
to
my
marrying
into
such
a
family
but
went
about
the
business
end
with
diligence
i
made
a
very
nice
settlement
upon
alathea
more
than
he
thought
was
necessary
then
he
spoke
of
arrangements
for
possible
children
and
fixed
that
too
i
wonder
what
she
will
say
when
she
reads
that
part
i
have
settled
with
the
duchesse
who
is
entering
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
with
her
usual
delicious
whimsical
understanding
that
some
time
soon
after
the
wedding
she
shall
ask
about
ten
of
our
principal
mutual
friends
to
come
in
the
afternoon
and
she
will
present
alathea
to
them
and
if
anyone
makes
comments
upon
the
matter
she
will
say
that
she
is
the
daughter
of
an
old
english
friend
and
even
if
coralie
recognizes
her
as
the
girl
who
was
with
me
at
versailles
she
will
not
dare
to
say
a
word
about
any
protegée
of
the
duchesse
she
is
much
too
afraid
of
offending
her
being
received
at
the
hotel
de
courville
herself
on
sufferance
only
because
of
her
birth
and
family
as
for
maurice
i
can
manage
him
now
i
am
beginning
to
wonder
what
alathea
would
prefer
to
do
i
do
want
to
see
her
until
the
ceremony
but
i
suppose
i
must
the
duchesse
has
arranged
that
i
should
meet
my
in
her
and
sign
the
contract
there
on
the
day
before
the
wedding
five
days
from
now
alathea
she
tells
me
is
like
a
frozen
image
but
faithful
to
her
promise
to
me
my
dear
old
friend
has
not
made
any
comment
or
tried
to
aid
matters
i
think
she
rejoices
that
i
shall
have
such
an
interesting
time
in
the
breaking
down
of
the
barrier
nina
writes
heartbrokenly
johnnie
was
very
dear
to
her
sorrow
seems
to
have
brought
out
all
that
is
best
in
her
she
says
she
feels
that
she
just
drifted
along
taking
all
good
and
happiness
for
granted
and
not
doing
enough
for
other
people
and
that
now
she
is
going
to
devote
her
life
to
making
jim
happy
and
contented
and
hopes
some
day
not
too
far
off
to
have
another
child
to
care
for
darling
old
nina
she
always
was
the
best
sort
in
the
world
of
suzette
i
have
heard
nothing
although
burton
says
he
caught
sight
of
her
on
the
stairs
just
whisking
into
the
flat
above
mine
which
has
been
taken
by
a
lovely
actress
a
cousin
of
hers
who
has
married
a
rich
retired
jew
there
are
still
possibilities
of
complications
here
but
i
feel
quite
serene
alathea
will
be
mine
she
can
not
get
away
from
me
i
can
insidiously
from
day
to
day
carry
out
my
plan
of
winning
her
and
the
tougher
the
fight
is
the
more
it
will
be
worth
while
afterwards
was
really
wonderful
nelson
has
presumably
seen
alathea
and
her
family
several
times
i
have
refused
to
hear
anything
about
it
and
he
arrived
with
her
alone
at
the
hotel
de
courville
i
had
understood
that
her
mother
was
coming
with
her
but
she
was
ill
and
did
not
turn
up
the
duchesse
and
i
were
talking
when
the
two
were
announced
alathea
was
in
a
nice
little
grey
frock
and
had
her
glasses
on
i
think
she
knew
the
duchesse
would
not
approve
of
that
camouflage
because
there
was
an
air
of
defiance
about
her
her
rebellious
cupid
bow
of
a
mouth
was
shut
sternly
she
was
even
quite
repellant
she
has
never
attracted
me
more
the
duchesse
was
sweet
to
her
and
made
no
remark
about
the
glasses
but
was
called
back
to
the
ward
almost
immediately
for
a
little
and
while
she
was
gone
nelson
read
over
the
settlement
i
think
you
are
giving
me
a
great
deal
too
much
alathea
said
annoyedly
i
shall
feel
uncomfortable
and
chained
i
intend
my
wife
to
have
this
i
answered
quietly
so
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
agree
she
pulled
in
her
lips
but
said
no
more
until
the
part
about
the
children
came
when
she
started
to
her
feet
her
cheeks
crimson
what
is
this
ridiculous
clause
she
asked
angrily
old
nelson
looked
unspeakably
shocked
it
is
customary
in
all
marriage
settlements
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
reprovingly
and
alathea
looked
at
me
with
suspicion
but
she
said
nothing
and
the
duchesse
returning
then
to
the
room
all
was
soon
signed
sealed
and
delivered
nelson
withdrew
saying
he
would
call
for
miss
bulteel
next
day
for
the
wedding
when
we
were
alone
the
duchesse
kissed
us
both
i
hope
for
your
happiness
my
children
she
said
i
know
you
both
and
your
droll
characters
the
time
will
come
when
you
may
know
each
other
and
in
any
case
i
feel
that
you
will
both
remember
that
a
recognition
of
correct
behaviour
helps
all
situations
in
life
and
the
rest
is
in
the
hands
of
the
then
she
left
us
again
and
alathea
sat
stiffly
down
upon
an
uncompromising
little
louis
xv
out
of
my
reach
i
did
not
move
or
speak
indeed
i
lit
a
cigarette
casually
alathea
face
was
a
study
i
watched
her
lazily
how
had
i
ever
thought
her
plain
even
in
those
first
days
disguised
with
the
horn
spectacles
and
the
tornback
hair
the
contour
of
her
little
face
is
so
perfectly
oval
and
her
neck
so
round
and
long
but
not
too
long
there
is
not
the
least
look
of
scragginess
about
her
just
extreme
slenderness
a
creature
of
perhaps
five
foot
four
or
five
with
childish
outline
in
the
becoming
little
grey
frock
and
even
with
the
glasses
on
she
is
lovely
perhaps
she
seems
so
to
me
because
i
now
know
that
the
glasses
are
not
necessary
the
expression
of
her
mouth
said
am
i
being
tricked
does
the
man
mean
to
seize
me
when
he
gets
me
alone
shall
i
run
away
and
have
done
with
it
she
was
restless
her
old
serenity
seems
to
have
deserted
her
i
wanted
to
ask
you
i
began
calmly
what
you
would
like
to
do
immediately
after
the
wedding
i
mean
would
you
prefer
that
we
went
to
versailles
the
passport
business
makes
everything
so
difficult
or
would
you
rather
go
down
to
the
riviera
or
just
stay
at
the
flat
i
do
care
in
the
least
she
replied
ungraciously
then
if
you
do
care
we
will
stay
at
the
flat
because
if
i
do
not
interrupt
my
treatment
i
shall
be
the
sooner
well
to
go
to
england
have
you
engaged
a
maid
yes
you
will
give
orders
that
your
trunks
are
sent
in
in
the
morning
then
and
that
she
has
everything
ready
for
you
very
well
all
this
time
her
face
was
turned
away
from
me
as
much
as
possible
for
one
second
a
fear
came
to
me
that
after
all
perhaps
it
is
real
hate
she
has
for
me
which
will
be
unsurmountable
and
i
was
impelled
to
ask
her
alathea
do
you
detest
the
idea
of
marrying
me
so
much
that
you
would
rather
break
the
whole
thing
she
turned
and
faced
me
now
and
i
feel
sure
blue
fire
was
coming
from
those
beautiful
eyes
could
i
have
seen
them
it
is
not
a
question
of
what
i
would
wish
or
not
nor
of
my
feelings
in
any
way
i
am
going
through
with
the
ceremony
and
shall
be
your
permanent
secretary
because
i
am
under
great
monetary
obligations
to
you
and
wish
for
security
for
my
family
in
the
future
you
put
it
to
me
that
you
wanted
to
buy
me
and
i
could
name
the
price
you
have
overpaid
it
i
shall
not
go
back
upon
my
promise
only
i
want
to
feel
perfectly
sure
that
you
will
expect
nothing
more
of
me
than
what
we
have
arranged
i
shall
expect
nothing
more
your
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
will
suggest
to
you
not
to
make
either
of
us
look
ridiculous
in
public
by
your
being
over
disagreeable
to
me
we
shall
carry
on
with
a
semblance
of
mutual
respect
i
hope
she
bowed
the
temptation
to
burst
out
and
tell
her
of
my
feelings
was
extraordinary
i
absolutely
trembled
with
the
control
it
required
not
to
rise
from
my
chair
and
go
and
take
her
hands
but
i
restrained
every
sign
and
appeared
as
indifferent
as
she
is
the
duchesse
came
back
in
a
few
moments
and
i
said
i
would
go
i
did
not
even
then
shake
hands
with
alathea
and
the
duchesse
came
out
into
the
passage
with
me
to
see
me
safe
into
the
lift
she
is
always
so
kind
to
anything
crippled
nicholas
she
whispered
her
manner
to
you
is
very
cruel
but
do
not
be
discouraged
i
feel
that
it
is
more
promising
than
if
she
were
kind
she
has
also
had
a
dreadful
time
with
the
father
who
has
now
been
transferred
to
the
in
the
desert
in
africa
one
must
hope
for
good
and
her
poor
mother
is
going
off
to
hyères
with
little
hilda
and
their
faithful
old
maid
the
only
servant
they
had
so
after
the
wedding
you
will
have
your
bride
all
to
yourself
perhaps
the
thought
of
that
is
what
is
making
her
so
reluctant
and
icy
the
duchesse
laughed
as
she
handed
me
my
crutch
and
closed
the
lift
door
time
will
tell
my
son
and
she
waved
her
hand
as
i
disappeared
below
and
now
i
am
alone
before
the
crackling
fire
in
my
and
i
wonder
how
many
men
have
spent
the
eve
of
their
marriages
in
so
quiet
a
manner
i
feel
no
excitement
even
i
have
this
journal
it
is
a
pretty
poor
literary
effort
but
it
does
chronicle
my
emotions
and
the
gradual
growing
influence
alathea
has
been
exercising
upon
me
by
putting
down
what
happens
between
us
each
day
like
this
i
can
then
review
progress
once
a
week
and
can
take
stock
of
little
shades
which
would
not
be
remembered
otherwise
at
that
moment
the
telephone
rang
and
george
harcourt
asked
if
he
might
come
round
and
smoke
a
cigar
your
ones
are
so
good
nicholas
he
said
he
was
in
at
the
ritz
from
versailles
for
the
night
i
answered
yes
i
like
to
talk
to
old
george
i
do
know
why
i
call
him
old
always
he
is
perhaps
and
absolutely
well
preserved
and
women
love
him
passionately
more
perhaps
than
when
he
was
young
when
we
were
settled
in
two
comfortable
arm
chairs
before
the
fire
he
held
forth
as
usual
he
had
arranged
the
affairs
of
bobby
bulteel
only
in
the
nick
of
time
i
have
all
the
receipts
nicholas
to
hand
to
you
he
said
the
wretched
creature
was
overcome
with
gratitude
we
had
a
long
chat
and
he
plans
to
clear
out
and
start
life
afresh
in
the
argentine
as
soon
as
war
is
over
and
he
can
be
released
from
his
commission
he
is
bound
to
end
in
hell
with
his
temperament
but
it
wo
matter
so
long
as
poor
lady
hilda
is
not
dragged
down
too
he
agreed
to
leave
the
family
here
unmolested
now
and
not
return
for
years
to
them
when
he
does
retire
from
the
army
then
i
told
my
old
friend
that
i
intended
to
marry
the
daughter
on
the
morrow
he
was
very
surprised
i
could
not
imagine
what
your
interest
could
be
nicholas
unless
it
had
something
to
do
with
a
woman
but
where
did
you
ever
meet
the
girl
my
dear
boy
i
explained
you
might
come
to
the
wedding
george
i
said
illustration
alathea
harriet
hammond
realizes
that
suzette
renee
adoree
is
the
only
woman
that
stands
between
her
and
the
love
of
sir
nicholas
lew
cody
a
scene
from
elinor
glyn
production
man
and
maid
for
he
promised
he
would
then
he
smoked
for
a
minute
or
two
in
silence
pretty
terrible
thing
marriage
and
he
puffed
blue
rings
with
perfect
precision
i
have
never
been
able
to
face
it
what
has
made
you
slip
into
the
mesh
because
i
think
i
have
found
someone
who
will
be
a
good
companion
and
not
bore
me
you
are
not
in
love
then
it
is
a
sensible
arrangement
and
in
that
way
you
have
a
chance
of
happiness
also
the
girl
has
had
a
hard
life
and
may
be
grateful
for
comfort
and
kindness
what
do
you
suppose
men
really
want
george
the
continuous
stimulation
of
the
hunting
instinct
of
course
it
is
satiety
which
kills
everything
but
what
a
small
percentage
of
women
know
how
to
keep
it
alive
on
the
mental
side
i
waited
for
him
to
go
on
you
see
dear
boy
love
which
is
only
the
camouflaged
aspect
of
the
creative
instinct
can
not
really
hold
but
a
clever
woman
acts
as
a
spur
to
the
mind
keeps
it
hunting
in
the
abstract
as
well
as
gratifying
not
too
generously
the
physical
desires
unfortunately
it
has
never
been
my
good
fortune
to
encounter
such
a
being
so
i
have
never
been
able
to
remain
faithful
you
are
very
much
in
luck
if
bobby
girl
shows
intelligence
she
ought
to
be
a
remarkable
creature
because
she
was
born
at
the
white
heat
of
passion
on
both
parents
side
and
and
devotion
added
on
the
mother
she
is
george
my
best
wishes
nicholas
i
think
you
are
wise
probably
wounded
as
you
are
it
will
be
nice
for
you
to
have
an
agreeable
companion
and
he
sighed
you
have
quite
finished
with
violetta
now
that
is
the
odd
part
and
he
actually
removed
his
cigar
from
his
lips
i
thought
i
had
but
when
i
went
to
see
her
with
the
certain
intention
of
deceiving
her
and
backing
out
gracefully
that
vixen
carmencita
was
drawing
me
so
strongly
i
found
violetta
quite
tranquil
she
said
she
had
realized
that
i
was
cooling
off
and
her
rule
was
to
hold
nothing
which
did
not
wish
to
stay
so
she
was
quite
prepared
to
part
from
me
she
was
very
tender
she
looked
beautiful
and
you
know
when
it
came
to
saying
farewell
i
found
myself
quite
unable
to
do
so
i
had
prepared
a
lot
of
lies
about
my
not
being
justified
in
giving
the
time
from
my
work
but
before
i
could
tell
them
violetta
had
forestalled
me
by
assuring
me
that
she
knew
i
must
really
stick
closer
to
my
office
and
she
would
no
longer
expect
much
of
my
company
you
know
nicholas
i
suddenly
found
her
charm
renewed
tenfold
and
i
could
only
congratulate
myself
upon
the
fact
that
the
affair
with
carmencita
had
not
gone
far
enough
to
amount
to
anything
and
now
i
am
in
pursuit
of
violetta
again
and
my
soul
nicholas
if
she
only
keeps
me
wondering
i
believe
i
shall
be
really
in
love
shall
you
marry
george
he
looked
almost
bashful
it
is
just
possible
violetta
is
a
widow
then
our
eyes
met
and
we
both
laughed
aloud
you
can
contemplate
happiness
george
with
your
widow
because
you
feel
that
she
now
knows
how
to
handle
you
and
i
contemplate
happiness
with
my
little
girl
because
i
respect
her
character
and
adore
every
inch
of
her
and
by
jove
old
man
i
believe
we
shall
both
get
what
we
are
looking
for
then
our
talk
drifted
to
politics
and
the
war
and
it
was
just
about
midnight
before
old
george
left
and
when
he
had
gone
i
opened
the
window
wide
and
looked
out
on
the
night
there
was
a
half
moon
almost
set
and
the
air
was
still
and
very
warm
for
the
beginning
of
november
there
are
nights
like
that
mysterious
and
electric
when
all
sorts
of
strange
forces
seem
to
be
abroad
and
something
of
romance
in
me
exalted
my
spirit
and
i
found
myself
saying
a
prayer
that
i
might
be
true
to
my
trust
and
have
strength
enough
of
will
to
wait
patiently
until
my
alathea
comes
voluntarily
into
my
arms
and
how
i
wonder
what
she
is
thinking
about
there
at
auteuil
i
went
along
into
the
room
which
is
to
be
hers
and
i
saw
that
it
was
all
arranged
except
the
flowers
which
would
come
in
fresh
in
the
morning
and
then
i
hobbled
back
to
my
own
room
and
rang
for
burton
the
faithful
creature
waits
for
me
no
matter
how
late
i
am
when
i
was
safely
in
bed
he
came
over
to
me
and
his
dear
old
face
showed
emotion
i
do
indeed
wish
you
happiness
sir
nicholas
will
be
the
best
day
of
my
life
we
shook
hands
silently
and
he
left
me
still
writing
in
this
journal
i
feel
no
excitement
rather
as
if
another
act
in
the
drama
of
life
was
ended
that
is
all
and
that
i
am
starting
upon
a
new
one
which
will
decide
whether
the
end
of
the
play
shall
be
tragedy
or
content
xxii
i
am
not
going
to
describe
the
wedding
in
this
journal
a
civil
ceremony
is
not
interesting
in
its
baldness
i
had
literally
no
emotions
and
alathea
looked
as
pale
as
her
white
frock
she
wore
a
little
sable
toque
and
a
big
sable
cloak
i
had
sent
her
the
night
before
by
nelson
the
ring
was
the
new
diamond
hoop
set
in
platinum
no
more
gold
fetters
for
modern
girls
old
george
and
nelson
were
our
witnesses
and
the
whole
thing
was
over
in
a
few
minutes
and
we
were
being
congratulated
burton
was
by
far
the
happiest
face
there
as
he
helped
me
into
the
automobile
lent
by
the
embassy
alathea
had
just
shaken
hands
with
nelson
and
been
wished
joy
by
george
i
wonder
what
he
thought
of
the
glasses
which
even
for
the
wedding
she
had
not
taken
off
may
you
know
every
happiness
lady
thormonde
he
said
take
care
of
nicholas
and
make
him
quite
well
he
is
the
best
fellow
on
earth
alathea
thanked
him
coldly
he
is
such
a
citizen
of
the
world
that
he
showed
no
surprise
and
finally
we
were
off
on
our
way
to
the
flat
here
madame
bizot
and
her
daughter
and
the
baby
awaited
us
and
in
the
creature
tiny
hand
was
a
bunch
of
violets
this
was
the
first
time
alathea
smiled
she
bent
and
kissed
the
wee
face
these
people
know
and
love
her
i
stayed
behind
a
few
moments
to
express
my
substantial
appreciation
of
their
friendly
interest
burton
had
been
beside
the
chauffeur
to
help
me
in
and
out
and
while
we
had
been
driving
alathea
had
not
spoken
a
word
she
had
turned
from
me
and
her
little
body
was
drawn
back
as
far
in
the
corner
as
possible
my
own
emotions
were
queer
i
did
not
feel
actually
excited
i
felt
just
as
i
used
when
we
were
going
to
take
up
a
new
position
on
the
line
where
great
watchfulness
would
be
necessary
to
succeed
the
maid
alathea
had
engaged
arrived
in
the
morning
and
i
had
had
the
loveliest
flowers
put
in
all
the
rooms
pierre
intended
to
outdo
himself
for
the
wedding
i
knew
and
burton
had
been
able
to
find
somewhere
a
really
respectable
looking
footman
not
too
obviously
wounded
alathea
handed
me
my
crutch
as
we
got
out
of
the
lift
perhaps
she
thinks
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
her
new
duties
we
went
straight
into
the
and
i
sat
down
in
my
chair
her
maid
named
henriette
had
taken
her
cloak
and
hat
in
the
hall
and
i
suppose
from
sheer
nervousness
and
to
cover
the
first
awkward
moments
alathea
buried
her
face
in
the
big
bowl
of
roses
on
a
table
near
another
arm
chair
before
she
sat
down
in
it
what
lovely
flowers
she
said
they
were
the
first
words
she
had
spoken
to
me
directly
i
wondered
what
would
be
your
favorites
you
must
tell
me
for
the
future
i
just
had
roses
because
they
happen
to
be
mine
i
like
roses
best
too
i
was
silent
for
quite
two
minutes
she
tried
to
keep
still
then
i
spoke
and
i
could
hear
a
tone
of
authority
in
my
voice
alathea
again
i
ask
you
please
to
remove
your
glasses
as
i
told
you
before
i
know
that
you
wear
them
only
so
that
i
may
not
see
your
eyes
not
for
sight
or
light
or
anything
to
keep
them
on
is
a
little
undignified
and
ridiculous
now
and
irritates
me
very
much
she
colored
and
straightened
herself
to
remove
my
glasses
was
not
part
of
the
bargain
you
should
have
made
it
a
condition
if
you
had
wanted
to
impose
it
i
do
not
admit
that
you
have
the
least
right
to
ask
me
to
take
them
off
and
i
prefer
to
wear
them
for
what
possible
reason
i
will
not
tell
you
i
felt
my
temper
rising
if
i
had
not
been
a
cripple
i
could
not
have
resisted
the
temptation
to
rise
and
seize
her
in
my
arms
tear
the
d
d
things
off
and
punish
her
with
a
thousand
kisses
as
it
was
i
felt
an
inward
rage
what
a
fool
i
had
been
not
to
have
actually
made
the
removal
of
them
a
qua
before
i
signed
the
contract
it
is
very
ungenerous
of
you
and
shows
a
spirit
of
hostility
which
i
think
we
agreed
that
you
would
drop
silence
the
desire
to
punish
her
physically
beat
her
make
her
obey
me
was
the
only
thing
i
felt
a
nice
emotion
for
a
wedding
day
do
you
mean
to
wear
them
all
the
time
even
when
we
go
out
in
the
world
i
asked
when
i
could
control
my
voice
probably
very
well
then
i
consider
you
are
breaking
the
bargain
in
spirit
if
not
in
the
letter
you
yourself
said
you
were
going
to
be
my
permanent
secretary
no
secretary
in
the
world
would
insist
upon
doing
something
she
knew
to
be
a
great
irritation
to
her
employer
silence
you
are
only
lowering
yourself
in
my
estimation
by
showing
this
obstinacy
since
we
have
now
to
live
together
i
would
rather
not
have
to
grow
to
despise
you
for
childishness
she
started
to
her
feet
and
with
violence
threw
the
glasses
on
to
the
table
her
beautiful
eyes
flashed
at
me
the
lashes
are
that
peculiar
curly
kind
not
black
but
soft
and
dusky
a
little
lighter
near
the
skin
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
seen
such
eyelashes
on
a
lids
one
sees
them
quite
often
on
little
boys
especially
little
vagabonds
in
the
street
the
eyes
themselves
are
intensely
blue
and
with
everything
of
passion
and
magnetism
and
attraction
in
them
it
is
no
wonder
she
wore
glasses
while
having
to
face
the
world
by
herself
a
woman
with
eyes
like
that
would
not
be
safe
alone
in
any
avocation
where
men
could
observe
her
i
have
never
seen
such
expressive
fascinating
eyes
in
my
life
i
thrilled
in
every
fibre
of
my
being
and
with
triumph
also
to
think
that
our
first
battle
should
be
won
thank
you
i
said
making
my
voice
very
calm
i
had
grown
so
to
respect
your
balance
and
serenity
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
have
to
change
my
opinion
i
could
see
that
she
was
palpitating
with
fury
at
having
been
made
to
obey
i
felt
it
wise
to
turn
the
conversation
i
suppose
lunch
will
be
ready
soon
she
went
towards
the
door
then
and
left
me
i
wondered
what
she
would
say
when
she
got
to
her
room
and
found
the
three
sapphire
bangles
waiting
for
her
on
the
dressing
table
i
had
written
on
a
card
inside
the
lid
of
the
box
to
alathea
with
her
husband
best
wishes
burton
announced
lunch
before
she
returned
to
the
i
sent
him
to
say
that
it
was
ready
and
a
moment
after
she
came
in
she
had
the
case
in
her
hand
which
she
put
down
on
the
table
and
her
cheeks
were
very
pink
her
eyes
she
kept
lowered
i
wish
you
would
not
give
me
presents
she
gasped
a
little
breathlessly
coming
close
up
to
my
chair
i
do
not
care
to
receive
them
you
have
loaded
me
with
things
the
sables
the
diamond
ring
the
clothes
everything
and
now
these
i
took
the
case
and
opened
it
removing
the
bangles
give
me
your
wrist
i
said
sternly
she
looked
at
me
too
surprised
at
my
tone
to
speak
i
put
out
my
hand
and
took
her
bare
arm
her
sleeves
were
to
the
elbows
and
i
deliberately
put
the
three
bracelets
on
while
she
stood
petrified
i
have
had
enough
of
your
disagreeable
temper
i
said
in
the
same
voice
you
will
wear
these
and
anything
else
i
choose
to
give
you
though
your
rudeness
will
soon
remove
my
desire
to
give
you
anything
she
was
absolutely
flabbergasted
but
i
had
touched
her
pride
i
apologize
if
i
have
seemed
rude
she
said
at
last
i
suppose
you
have
the
right
really
only
and
her
whole
slender
body
quivered
with
a
wave
of
rebellion
let
us
say
no
more
about
the
matter
but
go
into
lunch
only
you
will
find
that
i
am
not
such
a
weakling
as
you
no
doubt
supposed
you
would
have
to
deal
with
i
hobbled
up
from
my
chair
burton
discreetly
not
having
entered
the
room
alathea
gave
me
my
crutch
and
we
went
in
to
the
while
the
servants
were
in
there
i
led
the
conversation
upon
the
war
news
and
ordinary
subjects
and
she
played
the
game
but
when
we
were
alone
with
the
coffee
i
filled
her
glass
with
benedictine
which
she
had
refused
when
burton
handed
the
liqueurs
she
had
taken
no
wine
at
all
now
drink
whatever
toast
you
like
i
told
her
i
am
going
to
drink
one
to
the
time
when
you
do
hate
me
so
much
and
we
can
have
a
little
quiet
friendship
and
peace
she
sipped
her
glass
and
her
eyes
became
inscrutable
what
she
was
thinking
of
i
do
not
know
i
find
myself
watching
those
eyes
all
the
time
every
reflection
passes
through
them
they
are
as
expressive
of
all
shades
of
emotion
as
the
eyes
of
a
cat
though
the
beautiful
madonna
tenderness
i
have
never
seen
again
since
the
day
when
she
held
the
child
in
her
arms
and
i
was
rude
to
her
when
we
went
back
into
the
salon
i
knew
that
i
was
passionately
in
love
with
her
her
restiveness
is
absolutely
alluring
and
excites
all
my
hunting
instinct
she
looks
quite
lovely
and
the
subtle
magnetism
which
drew
me
the
first
days
even
when
she
appeared
poor
and
shabby
and
red
of
hand
is
stronger
than
ever
i
felt
that
i
wanted
to
crush
her
in
my
arms
and
devour
her
the
blood
thumped
in
my
temples
i
had
to
use
every
atom
of
my
will
with
myself
and
lay
back
in
my
chair
and
closed
my
eye
she
went
straight
to
the
piano
and
began
to
play
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
talking
telling
me
of
the
passion
in
her
soul
she
played
weird
russian
dances
and
crashed
agonizing
chords
then
she
played
laments
and
finally
a
soft
and
soothing
thing
of
mcdowell
and
every
note
had
found
an
echo
in
me
and
i
had
followed
it
almost
seemed
all
her
pain
you
play
divinely
child
i
said
when
she
had
finished
i
am
going
to
rest
now
will
you
give
me
some
tea
later
on
yes
and
her
voice
was
quite
meek
while
she
helped
me
with
my
crutch
and
i
went
to
the
door
of
my
room
i
would
like
you
to
wear
nice
soft
teagowns
my
eye
gets
so
wearied
with
everything
bright
after
a
while
i
hope
you
have
got
all
you
want
and
that
your
room
is
comfortable
yes
thanks
i
bowed
and
went
on
into
my
room
and
shut
the
door
burton
was
waiting
to
help
me
to
lie
down
it
has
been
a
very
tiring
day
for
you
sir
nicholas
he
said
and
for
her
ladyship
also
go
and
have
a
rest
yourself
burton
you
have
been
up
since
cock
crow
the
new
man
antoine
can
call
me
at
five
and
soon
i
was
in
a
land
of
blissful
dreams
of
course
it
was
the
very
irony
of
fate
that
suzette
should
have
selected
this
very
afternoon
to
come
in
and
thank
me
for
the
villa
which
she
was
just
now
going
down
to
see
antoine
opened
the
door
to
her
while
burton
was
out
i
heard
afterwards
that
she
told
him
she
had
an
appointment
with
me
when
he
had
hesitated
about
letting
her
in
she
was
quite
quietly
dressed
and
had
no
great
look
of
the
and
a
new
footman
blunted
with
war
service
was
probably
impervious
even
to
the
very
strong
scent
which
she
was
saturated
with
that
perfume
which
i
had
never
been
able
entirely
to
cure
her
liking
for
and
which
she
reverted
to
using
always
when
she
went
away
from
me
and
had
to
be
corrected
of
again
and
again
when
she
returned
antoine
came
to
my
room
by
the
passage
and
said
a
lady
was
in
the
salon
to
see
me
by
appointment
for
a
moment
i
was
not
suspicious
i
thought
it
might
be
coralie
and
fearing
alathea
might
be
somewhere
about
and
it
might
be
awkward
for
her
i
hastened
to
rise
and
go
in
to
see
and
get
rid
of
the
inopportune
guest
i
told
antoine
he
must
never
let
anyone
in
again
without
permission
it
was
just
growing
dim
in
the
salon
about
four
and
a
figure
rose
from
the
sofa
by
the
fire
as
i
entered
chou
mon
petit
i
heard
simultaneously
with
a
softly
closing
sound
of
the
door
behind
the
screen
which
masks
the
entrance
to
the
room
from
the
hall
antoine
leaving
i
supposed
at
the
time
probably
it
was
alathea
i
surmised
afterwards
suzette
i
exclaimed
angrily
why
do
you
come
here
she
flew
to
me
and
held
out
her
arms
expressing
affection
and
grateful
thanks
she
had
come
for
no
other
reason
only
just
to
express
her
friendly
appreciation
to
get
rid
of
her
was
all
i
desired
i
never
was
more
angry
but
to
show
it
would
have
been
the
poorest
game
i
did
not
tell
her
it
was
my
wedding
day
i
just
said
i
was
expecting
some
relatives
and
that
i
knew
she
would
understand
and
would
go
at
once
of
course
she
said
and
shook
me
by
the
hand
i
was
still
standing
with
my
crutch
she
was
passing
to
see
her
cousin
madame
angier
in
the
flat
above
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
come
in
it
must
be
the
very
last
time
suzette
i
said
i
have
given
you
all
that
you
wanted
and
i
would
rather
not
see
you
again
she
pouted
but
agreed
and
i
drew
her
to
the
door
and
saw
her
into
the
corridor
and
even
followed
her
to
the
front
door
she
was
chatting
all
the
time
i
did
not
answer
i
was
speechless
with
rage
and
could
have
sworn
aloud
when
at
last
i
heard
the
door
shut
between
us
then
i
strode
back
into
my
room
praying
that
alathea
been
unaware
of
my
visitor
nemesis
on
one
wedding
day
i
waited
until
five
and
then
went
back
into
the
to
my
chair
and
antoine
brought
in
the
tea
and
turned
on
the
lights
and
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
alathea
came
in
her
eyes
were
stony
and
as
she
advanced
up
the
room
she
sniffed
the
air
disgustedly
her
fine
nostrils
quivering
suzette
pungent
perfume
was
no
doubt
still
present
to
one
coming
from
outside
hauteur
contempt
and
disgust
expressed
themselves
in
my
little
darling
blue
eyes
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
she
wore
a
soft
lavender
frock
and
was
utterly
delectable
and
when
i
reflected
that
but
for
this
impassable
barrier
which
my
own
action
in
the
past
had
been
the
means
of
erecting
between
us
i
might
now
have
made
her
love
me
and
that
on
this
our
wedding
day
she
might
have
been
coming
into
my
arms
i
could
have
groaned
aloud
may
i
open
the
window
she
said
with
the
air
of
an
offended
empress
yes
do
open
it
wide
and
then
i
laughed
aloud
cynically
i
could
as
easily
have
cried
alathea
would
not
of
course
have
spoken
about
her
suspicions
to
do
so
would
have
inferred
that
she
took
an
interest
in
me
beyond
that
of
a
secretary
every
impression
she
always
has
given
me
is
that
nothing
in
my
life
can
matter
to
her
one
jot
but
i
know
that
this
affair
of
suzette
does
matter
to
her
that
she
resents
it
bitterly
that
it
is
the
cause
of
her
smouldering
anger
with
me
she
resents
it
because
she
is
a
woman
and
how
i
wish
i
might
believe
that
it
is
because
she
is
not
as
indifferent
towards
me
as
she
pretends
she
poured
out
the
tea
i
expect
my
face
looked
like
the
devil
i
did
not
speak
i
knew
i
was
frowning
angrily
a
rising
wind
blew
the
curtain
out
and
banged
the
window
she
got
up
and
shut
it
then
she
threw
some
cedar
dust
on
the
fire
from
the
box
which
it
is
kept
in
on
a
table
near
she
had
seen
burton
do
this
no
doubt
i
love
the
smell
of
cedar
burning
then
she
came
back
and
poured
out
the
tea
and
we
both
drank
it
silently
the
room
looked
so
comfortable
and
home
like
with
its
panelling
of
old
pitch
pine
cleaned
of
its
paint
and
mellowed
and
waxed
so
that
it
seems
like
deep
amber
showing
up
the
greyish
carvings
one
might
have
been
in
some
room
in
old
england
of
about
everything
looked
the
setting
for
a
love
scene
the
glowing
lamps
apricot
shaded
and
the
firelight
and
the
yellow
roses
everywhere
and
two
human
beings
who
belonged
to
one
another
and
were
young
and
not
cold
of
nature
sitting
there
with
faces
of
stone
and
in
each
one
heart
bitterness
again
i
laughed
aloud
the
mocking
sound
seemed
to
disturb
my
bride
she
allowed
her
tea
cup
to
rattle
as
she
put
it
down
nervously
would
you
like
me
to
read
to
you
she
asked
icily
and
i
said
yes
and
presently
her
beautiful
cultivated
voice
was
flowing
along
it
was
an
article
in
the
she
had
picked
up
and
i
did
not
take
in
what
it
was
about
i
was
gazing
into
the
glowing
logs
and
trying
to
see
visions
and
gain
any
inspiration
of
how
to
find
a
way
out
of
this
tangle
of
false
impression
i
must
wait
and
see
and
endeavor
when
we
get
more
accustomed
to
one
another
somehow
to
let
alathea
know
the
truth
when
she
finished
the
pages
she
stopped
i
think
he
is
quite
right
she
said
but
i
had
not
heard
what
the
argument
was
so
i
could
only
say
yes
will
it
interest
you
going
to
england
i
then
asked
i
dare
say
i
have
a
place
there
you
know
shall
you
care
to
live
in
it
after
the
war
is
over
i
believe
it
is
the
duty
of
people
to
live
in
their
homes
if
they
have
inherited
them
as
a
trust
and
i
can
always
count
upon
you
to
do
your
duty
i
hope
so
then
i
exerted
myself
and
talked
to
her
about
politics
and
what
were
my
views
and
aims
she
entered
into
this
stiffly
and
so
an
hour
passed
but
all
the
time
i
could
feel
that
her
inner
self
was
disturbed
and
more
resentful
and
rebellious
than
ever
we
had
been
two
puppets
making
conversation
all
the
time
neither
had
said
anything
naturally
at
last
the
pretense
ended
and
we
went
to
our
separate
rooms
to
dress
for
dinner
burton
had
returned
by
now
and
i
told
him
of
the
detestable
thing
which
had
happened
at
which
he
was
much
concerned
best
of
her
sort
was
sir
nicholas
but
i
always
said
they
bring
trouble
every
one
of
them
if
i
may
make
so
bold
and
as
i
hobbled
back
into
the
salon
to
meet
my
wife
for
our
first
dinner
alone
once
more
i
heartily
agreed
with
him
xxiii
alathea
looked
perfectly
lovely
when
she
came
into
the
salon
dressed
for
dinner
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
her
in
anything
pertaining
to
the
evening
she
had
a
gauzy
on
of
a
shade
of
blue
like
her
eyes
her
nut
brown
hair
was
beautifully
done
with
the
last
look
like
coralie
showing
her
tiny
head
whether
she
likes
it
or
no
i
must
give
her
some
pearl
earrings
and
my
mother
pearls
that
will
be
a
moment
but
i
had
better
wait
a
little
while
her
eyes
were
shining
with
excitement
or
resentment
or
a
mixture
of
both
she
was
purely
feminine
she
intended
to
attract
me
i
am
certain
her
subconscious
mind
did
at
all
events
even
though
she
would
not
have
admitted
it
to
herself
she
was
smarting
still
about
suzette
the
situation
fills
her
with
distrust
and
uneasiness
but
i
know
now
after
analysing
every
point
when
i
could
not
sleep
last
night
that
she
is
not
really
indifferent
to
me
and
it
is
because
she
is
not
that
she
is
angry
i
registered
a
vow
that
i
would
her
love
me
without
explaining
about
suzette
fate
can
let
her
find
out
for
herself
i
had
not
come
to
the
comforting
conclusion
that
she
is
not
indifferent
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
though
so
the
sense
of
and
triumph
did
not
uplift
me
then
i
was
still
worried
at
the
events
of
the
afternoon
i
had
troubled
to
put
on
a
tail
coat
and
white
waistcoat
not
a
dinner
jacket
as
usual
and
had
even
a
buttonhole
of
a
gardenia
found
by
burton
for
this
great
occasion
i
looked
into
her
eyes
with
my
one
blue
one
which
is
i
suppose
as
blue
as
her
own
she
instantly
averted
her
glance
i
can
not
offer
you
my
arm
milady
i
said
rather
sarcastically
so
we
will
have
to
go
in
after
each
other
she
bowed
and
led
the
way
the
table
was
too
beautifully
decorated
and
the
dinner
a
masterpiece
while
the
champagne
was
iced
to
perfection
and
the
burgundy
a
poem
the
pupils
of
alathea
eyes
before
the
partridge
came
were
black
as
night
burton
discreetly
marshalled
antoine
out
of
the
room
each
time
after
the
dishes
were
handed
when
will
you
get
your
new
eye
my
wife
i
like
to
write
that
asked
in
the
first
interval
when
we
were
alone
and
your
new
leg
i
suppose
they
will
both
be
restored
to
me
in
a
day
or
two
it
will
be
so
wonderful
to
walk
again
i
should
think
so
then
something
seemed
to
strike
her
suddenly
of
how
hateful
it
must
all
have
been
for
me
her
hard
expression
changed
and
she
almost
whispered
it
will
seem
like
a
new
life
i
mean
to
make
a
new
life
if
you
will
help
me
i
want
to
get
away
from
all
the
old
useless
days
i
want
to
do
things
which
are
worth
while
shall
you
soon
go
into
parliament
i
suppose
it
will
take
a
year
or
two
but
we
shall
begin
to
pave
the
way
directly
we
go
back
to
england
and
i
hope
that
will
be
for
christmas
she
avoided
looking
at
me
i
could
never
catch
her
eye
but
her
adorable
little
profile
was
good
enough
to
contemplate
the
crisp
curl
by
her
ear
delighted
me
and
another
in
the
nape
of
her
neck
filled
me
with
wild
longings
to
kiss
it
and
the
pearly
skin
beneath
it
i
think
i
deserve
great
praise
for
the
way
i
acted
for
the
whole
thing
was
acting
i
was
cold
and
as
haughty
and
aloof
as
she
was
herself
but
i
used
every
art
i
knew
of
to
draw
her
out
and
make
her
talk
she
is
such
a
lady
that
she
fell
into
the
stride
and
spoke
politely
as
if
to
some
stranger
who
had
taken
her
into
dinner
at
a
party
at
last
we
talked
of
the
duchesse
and
we
discussed
her
interesting
character
such
a
marvel
of
the
she
is
so
very
good
and
charitable
alathea
said
and
has
always
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
which
carries
her
through
things
you
laugh
sometimes
too
i
asked
with
assumed
surprise
that
is
delightful
i
adore
the
in
the
eye
but
i
was
afraid
you
would
never
unbend
far
enough
so
that
we
could
laugh
together
i
think
this
offended
her
life
would
be
impossible
without
a
sense
of
humor
even
if
it
is
a
grim
one
well
nothing
need
be
grim
any
more
and
we
can
both
smile
at
the
rather
absurd
situation
between
us
which
however
suits
us
both
admirably
you
will
never
interfere
with
me
or
i
with
you
no
there
was
a
tone
in
this
which
let
me
feel
that
her
thoughts
had
harked
back
to
suzette
the
duchesse
is
going
to
have
a
little
tea
party
for
us
on
saturday
you
know
so
that
you
may
be
introduced
as
my
wife
alathea
became
embarrassed
at
once
will
people
know
my
real
name
no
we
shall
tell
no
stories
but
we
shall
not
be
communicative
you
will
be
introduced
as
an
old
english
friend
of
the
duchesse
she
looked
at
me
for
an
instant
and
there
was
gratitude
in
her
expression
alathea
i
want
you
to
forget
all
about
the
troubles
which
must
have
clouded
your
life
they
are
all
over
now
and
some
day
perhaps
you
will
introduce
me
to
your
mother
and
little
sister
i
will
of
course
when
they
come
back
from
the
south
my
mother
has
often
been
so
i
want
you
to
feel
that
i
would
do
anything
for
them
are
you
sure
they
have
all
they
want
she
protested
indeed
yes
far
more
you
have
given
too
much
already
she
raised
her
head
with
that
indescribable
little
gesture
of
hauteur
which
becomes
her
so
beautifully
i
could
read
her
mind
it
said
i
loathe
receiving
anything
from
him
with
that
woman
in
the
background
when
we
went
into
the
salon
i
wondered
what
she
would
do
i
did
not
speak
she
took
my
crutch
and
shook
up
my
cushion
taking
great
care
not
to
touch
me
i
could
not
look
up
i
knew
that
a
powerful
electric
current
would
pass
from
my
eye
to
hers
if
i
did
and
that
she
would
see
that
i
was
only
longing
to
take
her
to
my
heart
i
remained
silent
and
gazed
into
the
fire
she
sat
down
quietly
on
the
sofa
at
the
side
so
that
i
would
have
to
turn
my
head
to
look
at
her
thus
we
remained
for
quite
five
minutes
speechless
the
air
throbbed
with
emotion
i
dared
not
move
at
last
she
said
would
you
care
that
i
should
read
to
you
again
or
play
play
for
a
little
my
voice
was
chilly
i
was
quite
determined
the
iciness
should
come
from
me
first
not
her
for
a
few
days
she
went
to
the
piano
and
she
began
the
debussy
she
had
played
that
afternoon
when
i
had
first
asked
her
to
play
i
never
can
remember
its
name
and
when
she
had
finished
she
stopped
what
made
you
play
that
now
i
asked
i
felt
like
it
it
wrenches
my
nerves
what
makes
you
feel
all
unrestful
and
rebellious
and
defiant
alathea
am
i
not
keeping
the
bargain
yes
of
course
you
are
bored
to
death
then
no
i
am
wondering
wondering
what
she
did
not
answer
i
could
not
see
her
without
getting
up
out
of
my
chair
please
come
here
i
asked
in
an
indifferent
cold
voice
you
know
it
is
so
difficult
for
me
to
move
she
came
back
and
sat
down
upon
the
sofa
again
the
light
of
the
apricot
lamp
fell
softly
on
her
hair
now
tell
me
about
what
you
were
wondering
her
mouth
grew
stubborn
and
she
did
not
speak
it
is
so
unlike
you
to
do
these
very
female
things
beginning
sentences
and
not
going
on
i
never
saw
anyone
so
changed
once
i
looked
upon
you
as
the
model
for
all
that
was
balanced
and
unlike
your
sex
it
was
i
who
used
to
feel
nervous
and
ineffectual
now
ever
since
we
have
been
engaged
you
seem
to
be
disturbed
and
to
have
lost
your
serenity
you
think
as
it
is
the
first
evening
that
we
are
alone
together
that
it
would
be
a
wise
thing
to
try
and
get
at
each
other
point
of
view
tell
me
the
truth
alathea
what
has
caused
the
alteration
in
you
now
she
looked
straight
at
me
and
there
was
defiance
in
her
expressive
eyes
that
is
just
what
i
was
wondering
about
it
is
true
i
seem
to
have
lost
my
serenity
i
am
i
am
conscious
of
you
a
delicious
sensation
of
joy
flowed
through
me
and
the
feeling
of
triumph
began
which
is
with
me
still
if
she
is
conscious
of
me
do
you
mind
if
i
smoke
i
asked
with
complete
casualness
to
hide
my
emotions
she
shook
her
head
and
i
lit
a
cigarette
you
were
uneasy
because
you
did
not
trust
me
you
thought
underneath
there
might
be
some
trap
and
that
i
would
seize
you
once
you
belonged
to
me
there
was
a
moment
when
i
might
have
felt
inclined
to
do
so
though
i
would
never
have
broken
my
word
but
you
have
cured
me
of
all
that
and
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
our
being
quite
good
acquaintances
even
if
your
prejudice
does
not
ever
allow
you
to
be
friends
for
a
second
a
blank
look
came
into
her
expression
i
was
banking
on
my
knowledge
of
the
psychology
of
a
human
mind
the
predatory
instinct
must
inevitably
be
aroused
in
her
by
my
attitude
of
indifference
if
i
can
only
act
well
enough
and
keep
it
up
i
should
certainly
win
in
a
fairly
short
space
of
time
but
she
is
so
attractive
i
do
not
yet
know
if
i
shall
have
the
strength
of
mind
to
do
so
are
you
not
going
to
give
me
some
regular
work
to
do
each
day
she
asked
with
a
tone
of
mock
respect
in
her
voice
none
of
the
letters
have
been
answered
lately
or
the
bills
paid
yes
i
scrambled
through
them
all
myself
while
i
was
waiting
but
if
you
will
look
over
the
book
again
we
might
finally
send
it
to
a
publisher
very
well
i
do
want
you
to
feel
that
you
have
ever
to
stay
in
or
do
any
work
you
do
feel
inclined
for
we
shall
have
lots
of
time
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
no
doubt
you
would
wish
to
spend
with
your
mother
if
she
is
going
away
i
said
to
her
this
morning
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
go
back
i
came
prepared
to
stay
unless
of
course
you
would
rather
be
alone
then
i
can
go
out
for
a
walk
this
last
with
a
peculiar
tone
in
the
words
naturally
you
will
want
to
go
for
walks
and
drives
and
shopping
you
do
imagine
that
i
shall
expect
you
to
be
a
prisoner
just
waiting
on
my
beck
and
call
yes
that
is
how
i
took
the
bargain
it
is
quite
unfair
otherwise
i
am
here
as
a
paid
dependant
and
receiving
really
too
high
wages
for
any
possible
work
i
can
give
in
return
i
would
not
have
entered
into
it
otherwise
or
on
any
other
terms
i
loathe
to
receive
favors
madame
lucifer
she
flashed
blue
sparks
at
me
i
am
not
forced
to
command
you
to
work
you
know
i
went
on
that
is
not
part
of
the
bargain
the
bargain
is
entirely
concerned
with
my
not
asking
to
give
me
any
favors
personal
favors
like
affection
or
caresses
etcetera
or
that
i
shall
ever
expect
you
to
be
really
my
wife
she
frowned
well
you
may
put
your
mind
entirely
at
rest
you
have
been
so
awfully
disagreeable
to
me
for
so
long
ever
since
we
were
at
versailles
in
the
summer
that
you
do
attract
me
at
all
now
except
your
intellect
and
your
playing
so
if
you
will
talk
sometimes
and
play
sometimes
that
will
be
all
right
i
do
desire
anything
else
now
assured
about
this
ca
you
be
at
ease
and
restful
again
i
know
why
she
wore
glasses
she
can
not
control
the
expression
of
her
eyes
the
pupils
dilate
and
contract
and
tell
one
wonderful
things
i
know
that
this
attitude
of
mine
is
having
a
powerful
effect
upon
her
the
feminine
in
her
hates
to
feel
that
she
has
lost
power
over
me
even
over
my
senses
i
could
have
laughed
aloud
i
was
so
pleased
with
my
success
but
i
did
not
dare
to
look
at
her
much
or
i
could
never
have
kept
the
game
up
she
was
more
delectable
than
i
can
ever
describe
it
would
interest
me
so
much
to
know
why
your
hands
used
to
be
so
red
i
asked
after
a
little
pause
they
are
getting
so
much
whiter
now
i
had
work
to
do
dishes
to
wash
our
old
nurse
was
too
ill
as
well
as
my
mother
and
my
little
brother
then
there
was
a
break
in
her
soft
voice
i
do
not
like
red
hands
any
more
than
you
do
they
distressed
my
father
always
i
will
try
to
take
care
of
them
now
yes
do
the
evening
post
had
come
in
and
been
put
by
burton
discreetly
on
a
side
table
he
naturally
thought
such
mundane
things
could
not
interest
me
on
my
wedding
night
i
caught
sight
of
the
little
pile
and
asked
alathea
to
bring
them
to
me
she
did
one
from
coralie
was
lying
on
top
and
one
immediately
under
it
from
solonge
de
clerté
alathea
saw
that
they
were
both
in
female
writing
the
rest
were
bills
and
business
do
you
permit
me
to
open
them
i
asked
punctiliously
of
course
and
she
reddened
are
you
not
master
here
how
absurd
to
ask
me
it
is
not
you
are
lady
thormonde
even
if
you
are
not
my
wife
and
have
a
right
to
courtesy
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
why
did
you
put
alathea
from
her
husband
on
the
bracelets
you
are
nicholas
and
not
my
husband
it
was
a
a
slip
of
the
pen
i
admit
you
are
right
and
indifferently
i
opened
coralie
effusion
smiling
over
it
i
put
up
my
hand
as
if
to
shade
my
eye
and
looked
at
alathea
through
the
fingers
she
was
watching
me
with
an
expression
of
slightly
anxious
interest
i
could
almost
have
believed
that
she
was
my
triumph
increased
i
removed
my
hand
and
appeared
only
to
be
intent
upon
coralie
letter
perhaps
we
each
have
friends
which
might
bore
the
other
so
when
you
want
to
have
parties
tell
me
and
i
will
arrange
to
go
out
and
when
i
want
to
i
will
tell
you
in
that
way
we
can
never
have
any
jars
thank
you
but
i
have
no
friends
except
the
duchesse
or
very
humble
people
who
do
want
to
come
to
parties
but
you
will
be
making
plenty
of
new
friends
now
i
have
some
which
you
will
meet
out
in
the
world
which
i
daresay
you
wo
care
about
and
some
who
come
and
dine
with
me
sometimes
who
probably
you
would
dislike
yes
i
know
how
do
you
know
i
asked
innocently
affecting
surprise
i
used
to
hear
them
when
i
was
typing
i
smiled
i
did
not
defend
them
if
you
should
chance
to
meet
would
you
be
civil
to
them
of
course
and
the
duchesse
has
often
described
them
all
it
was
who
came
to
talk
to
you
at
versailles
in
the
park
was
it
not
her
voice
was
contemptuously
amused
and
indifferent
but
her
little
nostrils
quivered
underneath
she
was
disturbed
i
knew
yes
coralie
is
charming
she
knows
more
about
how
to
put
clothes
on
becomingly
than
any
other
woman
do
they
dine
often
because
i
could
perhaps
arrange
to
go
and
have
my
music
lesson
with
monsieur
trani
on
those
evenings
twice
a
week
or
oftener
you
would
refuse
to
meet
them
i
pretended
to
be
annoyed
certainly
not
one
does
not
do
ridiculous
things
like
that
i
will
meet
whoever
you
wish
i
only
thought
it
might
spoil
your
pleasure
if
i
were
there
unless
of
course
you
have
told
them
that
i
am
only
a
permanent
secretary
masquerading
under
the
name
of
your
wife
so
that
they
need
not
restrain
themselves
her
face
had
become
inscrutable
she
was
quite
calm
now
i
grew
uncertain
again
for
a
moment
had
i
carried
the
bluff
far
enough
they
have
all
quite
charming
manners
but
as
you
infer
they
might
not
be
so
amused
to
come
to
the
dinner
of
a
married
man
i
think
the
last
part
of
your
speech
was
rather
a
reflection
upon
my
sense
of
being
a
gentleman
though
i
of
course
have
not
informed
anyone
of
our
quaint
but
remember
you
told
me
once
you
did
not
think
i
was
a
gentleman
so
i
must
not
be
offended
now
she
did
not
speak
she
was
looking
down
and
her
eyelashes
made
a
shadow
on
her
cheeks
her
mouth
was
sad
suddenly
something
pathetic
about
her
touched
me
she
is
such
a
gallant
little
fighter
she
has
had
such
an
ugly
cruel
life
and
oh
god
she
is
growing
to
love
me
and
soon
shall
i
be
able
to
tell
her
that
i
worship
the
ground
she
walks
on
and
appreciate
her
proud
spirit
and
great
but
i
can
not
chance
anything
i
must
go
on
and
follow
what
i
know
to
be
sound
psychological
reasoning
i
felt
my
will
weakening
then
she
looked
so
perfectly
exquisite
there
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
we
were
it
was
nearly
ten
at
night
the
flowers
were
scenting
the
air
the
lights
were
soft
the
dinner
had
been
perfection
after
all
i
am
a
man
and
she
legally
belongs
to
me
i
felt
the
blood
rushing
wildly
in
my
veins
i
had
to
clench
my
hands
and
shut
my
eye
i
expect
you
are
tired
now
i
said
a
little
breathlessly
so
i
will
say
milady
and
hope
that
you
will
sleep
well
the
first
night
in
your
new
home
i
got
up
and
she
came
forward
quickly
to
hand
me
my
crutch
she
whispered
quite
low
but
she
never
looked
at
me
then
she
turned
and
went
slowly
from
the
room
never
glancing
back
and
when
she
had
gone
instead
of
going
to
bed
i
once
more
sank
into
my
chair
i
felt
queerly
faint
my
nerves
are
not
sound
yet
i
expect
well
what
a
strange
wedding
night
burton
face
was
a
mask
when
he
came
to
undress
me
among
the
many
strange
scenes
he
has
witnessed
and
assisted
at
after
forty
years
spent
in
ministering
to
the
caprices
of
the
aristocracy
i
believe
he
thinks
this
is
the
strangest
when
i
was
in
bed
and
he
was
about
to
go
i
suddenly
went
into
a
peal
of
bitter
laughter
he
stopped
near
the
door
beg
pardon
sir
nicholas
he
said
as
though
i
had
called
to
him
are
women
the
weirdest
things
in
the
world
burton
they
are
indeed
sir
nicholas
and
he
smiled
one
and
all
from
to
ladies
like
her
ladyship
they
do
like
to
feel
that
a
man
belongs
to
themselves
you
think
that
is
it
burton
not
a
doubt
of
it
sir
nicholas
how
do
you
know
them
so
well
never
having
married
you
old
scallywag
perhaps
that
why
sir
a
married
man
looses
his
spirit
like
and
his
being
able
to
see
i
seem
lonely
do
i
burton
and
i
laughed
again
you
do
sir
nicholas
but
if
i
may
make
so
bold
as
to
say
so
i
think
you
will
be
so
very
long
her
ladyship
sent
out
for
a
cup
of
tea
directly
she
got
to
her
room
and
with
an
indescribable
look
of
blank
innocence
in
his
dear
old
eyes
this
philosopher
and
profound
student
of
women
respectfully
left
the
room
xxiv
the
day
after
my
marriage
i
did
not
come
into
the
salon
until
just
before
luncheon
at
twelve
my
bride
was
not
there
her
ladyship
has
gone
out
walking
sir
nicholas
burton
informed
me
as
he
settled
me
in
my
chair
i
took
up
a
book
which
was
lying
upon
the
table
it
was
a
volume
of
laurence
hope
last
poems
it
may
have
come
in
a
batch
of
new
publications
sent
in
a
day
or
two
ago
but
i
had
not
remarked
it
it
was
not
cut
all
through
but
someone
had
cut
it
up
to
the
page
and
had
evidently
paused
to
read
a
poem
called
listen
beloved
the
paper
knife
lay
between
the
leaves
whoever
it
was
must
have
read
it
over
and
over
for
the
book
opened
easily
there
and
one
verse
struck
me
forcibly
sometimes
i
think
my
longing
soul
remembers
a
previous
love
to
which
it
aims
and
strives
as
if
this
fire
of
ours
were
but
the
embers
of
some
wild
flame
burnt
out
in
former
lives
perchance
in
earlier
days
i
attain
that
which
i
seek
for
now
so
all
in
vain
maybe
my
soul
and
thine
were
fused
and
wed
in
some
great
night
long
since
dissolved
and
dead
and
then
my
eye
travelled
on
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
or
has
my
spirit
a
divine
prevision
of
vast
vague
passions
stored
in
days
to
be
when
some
strong
souls
shall
conquer
their
division
and
two
shall
be
as
one
eternally
we
are
both
strong
souls
shall
we
have
the
strength
to
conquer
outside
things
and
be
really
one
eternally
alathea
must
have
been
looking
at
this
not
an
hour
or
more
ago
what
did
it
make
her
think
of
i
wonder
i
determined
to
ask
her
to
read
the
whole
poem
presently
when
we
should
be
sitting
together
in
the
afternoon
it
had
come
on
to
rain
and
was
a
wretched
dismal
day
i
wondered
why
alathea
had
gone
out
probably
she
is
as
restless
as
i
am
and
being
free
to
move
she
can
express
her
mood
in
rapid
walking
i
began
to
plan
my
course
of
action
to
go
on
disturbing
her
as
much
as
possible
to
give
her
the
impression
that
i
once
thought
her
perfection
but
that
she
herself
has
disillusioned
me
and
that
i
am
indifferent
to
her
now
that
i
am
cynical
but
am
amused
to
discuss
love
in
the
abstract
that
i
have
friends
who
divert
me
and
that
i
really
only
want
her
to
be
a
secretary
and
companion
and
that
any
interest
i
may
show
in
her
is
merely
for
my
own
vanity
because
she
is
to
the
world
my
wife
if
i
can
only
keep
this
up
and
not
soften
should
i
see
her
distressed
and
not
weaken
or
give
the
show
away
i
must
inevitably
win
the
game
perhaps
sooner
than
i
dare
hope
i
felt
glad
she
had
not
been
there
so
that
i
could
pull
myself
together
and
put
my
armour
on
so
to
speak
before
we
met
i
heard
her
come
in
just
before
luncheon
and
go
to
her
room
and
then
she
came
on
to
the
without
her
hat
her
taste
is
as
good
as
coralie
probably
her
new
clothes
come
from
the
same
place
she
appeared
adorable
and
now
that
i
can
observe
her
at
leisure
she
seems
extremely
young
the
childish
outline
and
the
perfect
curve
of
the
little
cheek
she
does
not
look
over
eighteen
years
old
in
spite
of
the
firm
mouth
and
serene
manner
i
had
the
poems
in
my
hand
i
see
you
have
been
reading
these
i
remarked
after
we
had
given
each
other
a
cold
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
contracted
for
a
second
she
was
annoyed
with
herself
that
she
had
left
the
paper
cutter
in
the
book
yes
after
lunch
will
you
read
to
me
of
course
you
like
poetry
yes
some
this
kind
her
cheeks
became
softly
pink
yes
i
do
i
daresay
i
should
have
more
classical
tastes
but
these
seem
real
these
poems
as
if
the
author
had
meant
and
felt
what
she
was
writing
about
i
am
no
judge
of
poetry
in
the
abstract
i
only
like
it
if
it
expresses
some
truth
and
some
thought
which
appeals
to
me
this
was
quite
a
long
speech
for
her
then
poems
about
love
appeal
to
you
i
asked
surprised
why
not
why
not
indeed
only
you
always
have
seemed
so
austere
and
aloof
i
hardly
thought
such
a
subject
would
have
interested
you
she
gave
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
perhaps
even
the
working
bees
have
dreams
have
you
ever
been
in
love
she
laughed
softly
the
first
time
i
have
ever
heard
her
laugh
it
gave
me
a
thrill
i
do
think
so
i
have
never
talked
to
any
men
i
mean
men
of
our
class
this
relieved
me
but
you
dream
not
seriously
burton
announced
luncheon
at
that
moment
and
we
went
in
we
spoke
of
the
rain
and
she
said
she
liked
being
out
in
the
wet
she
had
walked
all
down
the
henri
to
the
we
spoke
of
the
war
news
and
the
political
situation
and
at
last
we
were
alone
again
in
the
salon
now
read
will
you
please
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
and
shaded
my
eye
with
my
hand
do
you
want
any
special
poem
read
several
and
then
get
to
beloved
there
is
a
point
in
it
i
want
to
discuss
with
you
she
took
the
book
and
settled
herself
with
her
back
to
the
window
a
little
behind
me
come
forward
please
it
is
more
comfortable
to
listen
when
one
can
see
the
reader
she
rose
reluctantly
and
pulled
her
chair
nearer
me
and
the
fire
then
she
began
she
chose
those
poems
the
least
sensuous
and
the
more
abstract
i
watched
her
all
the
time
she
read
rutland
gate
and
her
voice
showed
how
she
sympathized
with
the
man
then
she
read
atavism
and
her
little
highly
bred
face
looked
savage
i
realized
with
a
quiver
of
delight
that
she
is
the
most
passionate
creature
of
course
she
is
with
that
father
and
mother
wait
until
i
have
awakened
her
enough
and
she
will
break
through
all
the
barriers
of
convention
and
reserve
and
pride
ah
that
will
be
a
moment
now
read
beloved
she
turned
the
pages
found
it
and
began
and
when
she
reached
the
two
verses
which
had
so
interested
me
she
looked
up
for
a
second
and
her
lovely
eyes
were
misty
and
far
away
then
she
went
on
and
finished
letting
the
book
drop
in
her
lap
that
accords
with
your
theory
of
reincarnation
that
souls
meet
again
and
again
yes
in
one
of
the
books
i
got
upon
the
subject
it
said
all
marriages
were
karmic
debts
or
rewards
i
wonder
what
our
marriage
is
do
you
perhaps
we
were
two
enemies
who
injured
each
other
and
now
have
to
make
up
by
being
of
use
each
to
each
probably
she
was
looking
down
do
you
ever
have
that
strange
feeling
that
you
are
searching
for
something
all
the
time
something
of
the
soul
that
you
are
unsatisfied
yes
often
read
those
last
verses
again
her
voice
is
the
most
beautiful
i
have
ever
heard
modulated
expressive
filled
with
vibrant
vitality
and
feeling
but
this
is
the
first
time
she
has
read
anything
appertaining
to
love
i
could
hear
that
she
was
restraining
all
emphasis
and
trying
to
give
the
sensuous
passionate
words
a
commonplace
cold
interpretation
never
before
has
she
read
so
monotonously
i
knew
sensed
is
the
modern
word
that
this
was
because
she
probably
felt
and
understood
every
line
and
did
not
want
to
let
me
see
it
suddenly
i
found
myself
becoming
suffused
with
emotion
why
all
the
delay
the
fencing
the
fighting
to
obtain
this
desired
thing
this
woman
my
mate
that
she
is
my
mate
i
know
my
mate
because
my
love
is
not
based
upon
the
senses
alone
but
is
founded
upon
reverence
and
respect
i
hope
believe
i
that
we
shall
one
day
realize
the
truth
of
the
words
when
some
shall
conquer
their
division
and
two
shall
be
as
one
eternally
finding
at
last
upon
each
others
breasts
unutterable
calm
and
infinite
rest
for
me
that
means
love
not
the
mere
gratifying
of
the
hunting
instinct
not
the
mere
primitive
passion
for
the
longed
for
body
but
a
union
of
the
souls
which
can
be
satisfied
having
soared
beyond
the
laws
of
change
what
is
it
which
causes
unrest
obviously
because
something
is
wanting
upon
one
of
the
planes
on
which
we
love
and
so
that
part
which
is
unsatisfied
unconsciously
struggles
to
have
its
hunger
assuaged
elsewhere
there
is
no
aspect
of
mind
body
and
soul
in
me
which
i
feel
would
find
no
counterpart
in
alathea
if
i
reached
out
to
any
height
spiritually
she
could
go
as
high
or
higher
the
cleverest
working
of
the
brain
i
could
hope
to
manifest
would
find
a
complete
comprehension
in
her
and
as
for
the
body
any
student
of
physiognomy
can
see
that
those
delicate
little
nostrils
show
passion
and
that
cupid
bow
of
a
mouth
will
delight
in
kisses
oh
my
loved
one
do
not
make
we
wait
too
long
ye
gods
what
a
state
of
exaltation
i
was
in
when
i
wrote
those
lines
last
night
but
they
are
the
truth
even
if
i
now
laugh
at
my
expansion
i
wonder
how
many
men
are
romantic
underneath
like
i
am
and
ashamed
to
show
it
when
alathea
had
finished
the
verses
for
the
second
time
she
again
dropped
the
book
in
her
lap
what
is
your
conception
of
love
i
asked
casually
as
i
shall
always
have
to
crush
it
out
of
my
life
from
now
onward
i
would
rather
not
contemplate
what
my
conception
of
it
might
have
been
why
must
you
crush
it
out
i
asked
blandly
your
fidelity
to
me
was
not
part
of
the
bargain
fidelity
has
to
do
with
the
sex
relationships
which
do
not
concern
us
one
would
not
ask
a
secretary
to
become
a
nun
on
account
of
one
one
would
only
ask
her
to
behave
decently
so
as
not
to
shock
the
world
idea
of
the
situation
she
was
supposed
to
be
filling
her
face
grew
subtle
a
look
came
into
the
eyes
which
might
have
come
into
george
or
mine
i
suddenly
realized
how
well
she
really
knows
the
world
from
the
hard
school
the
circumstances
of
her
life
have
caused
her
to
learn
in
then
i
may
take
a
lover
some
day
should
i
desire
to
she
asked
a
little
cynically
certainly
if
you
tell
me
about
it
and
do
deceive
me
or
make
me
look
ridiculous
the
bargain
would
be
too
unfair
to
you
at
your
age
otherwise
she
looked
straight
into
my
eye
now
and
hers
were
a
little
fierce
and
you
shall
you
take
a
mistress
i
watched
the
smoke
of
my
cigarette
curling
possibly
i
answered
lazily
as
though
the
matter
were
too
much
a
foregone
conclusion
to
discuss
should
you
mind
a
faint
movement
showed
in
her
throat
as
if
she
had
stopped
herself
swallowing
she
looked
down
i
know
she
finds
it
very
difficult
to
lie
and
could
not
possibly
do
so
if
we
were
gazing
at
each
other
why
should
i
mind
no
of
course
why
should
you
she
looked
up
then
but
not
at
me
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
lip
curled
in
contempt
two
seems
vulgar
though
she
snapped
i
agree
with
you
the
idea
wounds
my
aesthetic
senses
then
we
need
not
expect
another
in
the
flat
just
yet
at
last
it
was
out
i
appeared
not
to
understand
and
smoked
on
calmly
and
before
i
could
answer
the
telephone
rang
she
handed
me
the
instrument
and
i
said
hello
it
was
coralie
she
spoke
very
distinctly
and
alathea
who
was
near
must
have
been
able
to
hear
most
of
the
words
in
the
silence
nicholas
i
am
going
to
be
by
myself
this
evening
you
will
have
a
dinner
for
me
just
us
alone
i
permitted
my
face
to
express
pleasure
and
amusement
watched
me
agitatedly
chère
alas
i
am
engaged
but
i
shall
see
you
soon
il
vrai
ce
coralie
said
this
loud
i
put
up
my
hand
so
as
to
be
able
to
continue
observing
alathea
face
it
was
the
picture
of
disgust
and
resentment
yes
it
is
perfectly
true
coralie
in
a
temper
one
could
gather
coralie
put
the
receiver
down
and
i
laughed
aloud
you
see
i
prefer
your
intellectual
conversation
to
any
of
my
friends
i
told
alathea
alathea
cheeks
were
a
bright
pink
it
is
not
that
her
tone
was
sarcastic
so
much
as
that
you
probably
have
a
sense
of
as
the
duchesse
says
after
a
little
while
you
will
not
have
to
observe
it
so
strictly
and
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
went
to
the
window
if
you
are
going
to
rest
now
i
would
wish
to
go
out
her
voice
was
a
little
hoarse
yes
do
go
and
if
you
will
be
near
the
de
la
go
into
roberts
and
ask
if
the
new
menthol
preparation
has
come
and
if
so
bring
it
back
to
me
it
takes
ages
for
things
to
be
sent
now
i
was
not
going
to
the
de
la
i
was
going
to
a
hospital
never
mind
then
and
do
hurry
back
burton
will
give
me
my
tea
so
until
dinner
miladi
i
had
to
say
all
this
because
i
was
at
breaking
point
and
could
not
any
longer
have
kept
up
the
game
but
would
have
made
an
ignominious
surrender
and
have
told
her
i
loved
her
and
loathed
the
idea
of
a
mistress
and
would
certainly
murder
any
lover
she
should
ever
glance
at
she
went
from
the
room
without
a
word
more
and
left
alone
i
tried
to
sleep
but
it
was
no
good
i
was
too
excited
i
do
think
i
am
such
a
fool
as
to
flatter
myself
i
am
trying
to
look
at
the
situation
abstractedly
and
it
seems
to
me
that
alathea
is
certainly
interested
in
me
certainly
jealous
of
suzette
of
coralie
furious
with
herself
for
being
so
really
convinced
now
that
she
has
lost
her
hold
upon
me
and
is
uneasy
rebellious
disturbed
and
unhappy
all
this
is
perfectly
splendid
my
darling
little
girl
after
a
while
i
went
to
sleep
in
my
chair
and
was
awakened
by
burton
coming
in
to
turn
on
the
lamps
her
ladyship
has
ordered
tea
in
her
room
sir
nicholas
he
told
me
shall
i
bring
yours
here
her
ladyship
has
come
in
then
i
said
her
ladyship
did
not
go
out
sir
burton
answered
surprised
what
did
this
mean
i
wondered
but
i
saw
no
sign
of
alathea
until
she
came
in
ready
for
dinner
as
the
clock
struck
eight
she
was
pale
but
perfectly
composed
she
had
evidently
been
having
some
battle
with
herself
and
had
won
all
through
dinner
she
talked
more
politely
and
indifferently
than
she
has
for
a
long
time
she
was
brilliantly
intelligent
and
i
had
a
most
delightful
repast
we
both
came
up
to
the
scratch
i
think
she
longs
to
visit
italy
she
told
me
she
has
not
been
there
since
she
was
a
child
i
said
i
would
take
her
directly
the
war
would
be
over
and
things
in
the
way
of
travel
had
become
possible
again
how
strong
her
will
must
be
to
have
so
mastered
herself
no
slightest
sign
of
emotion
one
way
or
another
showed
now
she
was
the
serene
aloof
companion
of
the
day
at
versailles
before
suzette
shadow
fell
upon
us
i
grew
puzzled
as
the
evening
wore
on
and
just
a
little
unsure
of
myself
had
i
gone
too
far
had
i
over
disgusted
her
had
all
interest
died
out
and
so
is
she
enabled
to
fulfill
the
bargain
without
any
more
disturbance
of
mind
i
asked
her
to
play
to
me
at
last
i
was
growing
so
apprehensive
and
she
went
from
one
divine
thing
to
another
for
quite
an
hour
and
then
at
ten
stopped
and
said
a
dignified
and
casual
leaving
me
sitting
in
my
chair
i
heard
twelve
and
one
strike
after
i
too
went
to
bed
no
sleep
would
come
i
was
reviewing
things
and
strengthening
my
courage
then
i
got
up
and
hobbled
into
the
salon
to
get
the
last
poems
the
door
was
open
why
i
do
know
nor
do
i
know
what
impelled
me
to
go
out
into
the
passage
and
towards
alathea
room
some
powerful
magnet
seemed
to
draw
me
the
carpets
are
very
deep
and
soft
no
noise
of
footfalls
can
be
heard
i
crept
near
the
door
and
stopped
what
was
that
faint
sound
i
listened
yes
it
was
a
sob
i
crept
nearer
was
a
soft
continued
moaning
as
of
one
in
resigned
distress
i
could
hardly
bear
it
i
could
hardly
prevent
myself
from
opening
the
door
and
going
to
her
to
comfort
her
my
darling
darling
little
girl
flight
was
my
only
resource
so
i
left
her
to
her
tears
and
returned
to
my
bed
and
when
i
was
safely
there
and
could
think
a
wild
sense
of
triumph
and
power
and
satisfaction
filled
me
the
weight
which
all
the
evening
her
marvelous
had
been
able
to
make
me
feel
lifted
from
my
heart
and
i
rejoiced
is
it
possible
that
the
primitive
instinct
of
the
joy
of
conquest
could
make
of
me
such
a
brute
gave
me
pleasure
to
know
that
my
little
love
suffered
the
sooner
would
she
belong
to
me
quite
xxv
marriage
is
the
most
turbulent
state
i
could
have
imagined
whether
or
not
alathea
and
i
will
ever
get
the
tangle
straightened
out
i
am
not
certain
now
as
i
write
saturday
afternoon
the
ninth
of
november
it
looks
as
if
we
were
parted
forever
and
i
am
so
irritated
and
angry
that
as
yet
i
feel
no
grief
the
quarrel
all
arose
from
my
fault
i
suppose
when
alathea
came
into
the
at
about
ten
she
had
blue
circles
round
her
eyes
and
knowing
what
caused
them
i
determined
to
ask
her
about
them
and
disturb
her
as
much
as
possible
this
was
mean
of
me
you
poor
child
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
crying
all
night
i
do
hope
nothing
is
troubling
you
her
cheeks
flushed
nothing
thank
you
your
room
can
not
be
properly
aired
then
or
something
i
have
never
seen
you
looking
so
wretchedly
i
do
wish
you
would
be
frank
with
me
something
must
have
worried
you
people
do
look
like
that
for
nothing
she
clasped
her
hands
together
i
hate
this
talk
about
me
what
does
it
matter
how
i
look
or
am
so
long
as
i
do
the
things
i
am
engaged
for
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
suppose
it
ought
not
to
but
one
has
a
feeling
that
one
hates
anyone
under
one
roof
to
be
unhappy
i
am
not
unhappy
i
mean
not
more
unhappy
than
i
have
always
had
to
be
but
the
causes
which
made
you
sad
before
have
been
removed
surely
only
things
which
are
occurring
now
from
day
to
day
between
you
and
me
can
bring
fresh
trouble
is
it
something
i
have
done
silence
alathea
if
you
knew
how
you
exasperate
me
by
your
silences
i
was
always
taught
that
it
was
very
rude
not
to
answer
when
one
was
spoken
to
it
depends
upon
who
speaks
and
what
about
and
whether
they
have
a
right
to
an
answer
then
the
inference
is
that
i
have
no
right
to
an
answer
when
you
are
silent
probably
i
grew
irritated
well
i
think
i
have
a
right
i
ask
you
a
plain
question
have
i
done
anything
which
has
caused
you
distress
distress
which
is
so
evident
that
you
must
have
been
crying
she
threw
up
her
arms
why
on
earth
can
not
you
keep
to
business
it
is
quite
unfair
if
i
were
really
your
secretary
and
nothing
more
you
would
never
persecute
me
for
answers
like
this
yes
i
would
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
know
why
anyone
in
my
service
is
unhappy
your
fencing
tells
me
that
it
something
which
i
have
done
which
has
hurt
you
and
i
insist
upon
knowing
what
it
is
i
shall
not
tell
you
defiantly
i
am
very
angry
with
you
alathea
my
voice
was
stern
i
do
care
hers
was
passionate
i
think
you
are
very
rude
you
have
told
me
that
before
well
i
am
rude
then
i
will
tell
you
nothing
i
will
do
nothing
but
just
be
your
servant
to
obey
orders
which
relate
to
the
work
i
have
been
engaged
for
i
felt
so
furious
i
had
to
lie
back
in
my
chair
and
shut
my
eye
you
have
a
very
poor
sense
of
a
bargain
if
you
only
keep
it
in
the
letter
your
underneath
constant
hostility
makes
everything
so
difficult
the
inference
of
your
whole
attitude
toward
me
and
of
everything
you
say
and
do
is
that
you
feel
injured
that
you
have
some
grudge
against
me
i
tried
to
speak
levelly
what
on
earth
have
i
ever
done
to
you
except
treat
you
with
every
courtesy
except
that
one
day
when
you
had
the
baby
in
your
arms
and
i
was
rude
but
apologized
and
that
one
other
time
when
i
kissed
you
and
god
knows
i
was
sorry
enough
afterwards
and
have
regretted
it
ever
since
what
the
reason
of
your
attitude
it
is
absolutely
unfair
this
seemed
to
upset
her
considerably
she
hated
the
idea
that
she
was
thought
unfair
it
may
have
made
her
realize
too
that
she
a
definite
sense
of
injury
she
lost
her
temper
she
stamped
her
scrap
of
a
foot
i
hate
you
she
burst
out
you
and
your
bargain
i
wish
i
was
dead
and
then
she
sank
into
the
sofa
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
by
the
shaking
of
her
shoulders
i
saw
that
she
was
crying
if
i
had
been
cool
enough
to
think
then
i
suppose
i
could
have
reasoned
that
all
this
was
probably
most
flattering
to
me
and
an
extra
proof
of
her
state
of
mind
but
the
agitation
it
had
plunged
me
into
made
me
unable
to
balance
things
and
i
too
allowed
my
temper
to
get
the
better
of
me
and
i
got
up
as
best
i
could
and
seizing
my
crutch
i
walked
towards
my
bedroom
door
i
shall
expect
an
apology
was
all
i
said
and
went
in
and
left
her
alone
if
we
are
to
go
on
fighting
like
this
life
wo
be
worth
living
i
tried
to
calm
myself
and
went
in
the
window
but
the
servants
came
into
the
room
to
make
the
bed
so
i
was
forced
to
go
back
again
to
the
alathea
had
gone
into
the
little
salon
i
suppose
because
for
the
same
reason
she
could
not
have
returned
to
her
room
i
sat
down
in
my
chair
quite
exhausted
i
did
not
feel
like
reading
or
doing
anything
it
was
that
we
were
to
go
to
the
duchesse
in
the
afternoon
for
alathea
to
be
presented
to
our
friends
as
my
wife
i
wondered
if
she
had
forgotten
this
after
an
hour
burton
came
in
with
the
second
post
you
do
look
badly
sir
nicholas
he
said
his
face
was
perplexed
and
troubled
can
i
get
you
anything
where
is
her
ladyship
burton
then
he
told
me
that
she
had
gone
out
i
could
see
he
wanted
to
say
something
his
remarks
are
generally
valuable
out
with
it
burton
i
do
think
it
is
that
causing
all
the
trouble
as
bad
luck
would
have
it
as
i
opened
the
door
to
let
her
ladyship
out
who
should
come
up
the
stairs
a
moment
after
but
they
must
have
passed
on
the
floor
below
neither
had
taken
the
lift
which
as
you
know
sir
nicholas
is
out
of
order
again
since
last
night
then
she
thinks
suzette
has
come
in
here
to
see
me
burton
by
jove
what
a
devilish
complication
i
think
we
had
better
move
from
the
flat
as
quickly
as
we
can
it
seems
as
if
it
would
be
advisable
sir
nicholas
can
you
suggest
anything
burton
i
really
am
quite
knocked
over
her
ladyship
do
chat
to
servants
like
some
ladies
or
i
could
easily
let
her
maid
know
that
do
visit
here
so
that
wo
do
he
mused
you
could
not
tell
her
yourself
straight
out
sir
nicholas
could
you
it
would
be
difficult
because
it
presupposes
i
think
she
minds
about
it
and
for
me
to
let
her
know
that
would
insult
her
more
than
anything
beg
pardon
sir
nicholas
but
there
was
a
young
woman
some
twenty
years
ago
who
had
a
temper
like
and
i
always
found
it
was
best
just
to
make
a
fuss
of
her
and
not
do
no
reasoning
that
is
what
they
wants
sir
nicholas
indeed
it
is
i
watched
them
in
all
classes
for
a
matter
of
many
years
you
can
get
what
you
want
of
them
if
you
only
make
a
fuss
of
them
what
does
make
a
fuss
of
exactly
mean
burton
well
it
is
not
for
me
to
tell
you
sir
knowing
ladies
as
you
do
but
it
is
just
kissing
and
fondling
them
and
them
things
makin
them
feel
that
they
just
everything
even
reasonable
sir
nicholas
burton
dryly
humorous
face
delighted
me
his
advice
was
first
class
too
i
think
it
over
i
told
him
and
he
left
me
alone
that
would
be
one
way
of
winning
or
losing
everything
certainly
but
it
would
also
be
breaking
my
word
and
i
do
believe
i
could
do
that
alathea
came
in
in
time
for
luncheon
her
face
was
set
in
a
mutinous
obstinate
mould
we
went
into
the
immediately
and
so
there
was
no
chance
of
conversation
i
noticed
that
she
wore
no
bracelets
or
rings
nothing
of
mine
not
even
the
wedding
ring
we
were
icy
to
each
other
during
the
meal
and
made
conversation
and
when
we
were
alone
with
the
coffee
i
just
said
i
hope
that
you
have
not
forgotten
that
at
four
we
are
to
go
to
the
duchesse
to
meet
the
friends
that
she
thinks
it
is
suitable
for
you
to
know
alathea
started
i
could
see
she
had
not
registered
this
fact
for
this
date
i
would
rather
not
go
she
said
resentfully
i
daresay
you
would
so
would
i
but
we
owe
the
duchesse
gratitude
for
all
her
kindness
to
us
and
i
fear
we
must
we
did
not
speak
further
i
could
not
talk
until
she
apologized
and
i
rose
to
go
out
of
the
room
she
gave
me
my
crutch
her
not
apologizing
made
me
burn
with
resentment
i
had
not
been
in
the
salon
a
minute
however
before
she
came
in
her
face
crimson
she
stood
in
front
of
me
i
apologize
for
showing
my
temper
this
morning
would
it
not
do
after
if
i
just
lived
out
somewhere
and
came
in
and
worked
as
before
it
is
a
perfect
farce
that
i
live
here
and
wear
a
wedding
ring
even
the
servants
must
be
laughing
at
me
i
notice
you
do
not
wear
a
wedding
ring
your
whole
attitude
is
perfectly
impossible
and
i
demand
an
explanation
what
is
the
reason
of
it
we
made
a
bargain
and
you
are
not
keeping
it
if
you
will
give
me
time
to
work
i
will
pay
you
back
the
fifty
thousand
francs
and
the
clothes
and
jewels
i
can
leave
behind
me
i
want
to
go
she
spoke
with
a
break
in
her
voice
now
why
do
you
want
to
go
suddenly
there
is
nothing
different
to
yesterday
or
any
other
day
i
refuse
to
be
the
puppet
of
your
caprices
she
stood
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
never
looking
at
me
alathea
i
said
sternly
look
me
straight
in
the
face
and
tell
me
the
truth
is
your
reason
i
ca
still
her
eyes
were
down
is
there
someone
else
my
voice
sounded
fierce
to
my
own
ears
i
had
a
sudden
fear
but
you
said
it
would
not
matter
if
there
was
someone
else
if
i
told
you
she
answered
defiantly
there
is
someone
else
then
i
tried
to
be
casual
look
at
me
slowly
she
raised
her
eyes
until
they
met
my
one
no
there
is
no
i
just
do
want
to
live
here
in
this
flat
any
longer
unless
you
can
give
me
some
definite
reason
for
this
extraordinary
behaviour
on
your
part
i
am
afraid
i
must
refuse
to
discuss
the
situation
and
meanwhile
will
you
please
go
to
your
room
and
fetch
the
rings
and
bracelets
she
turned
and
left
without
a
word
i
daresay
she
wondered
what
i
was
going
to
do
with
them
she
brought
them
back
come
here
close
she
came
rebelliously
give
me
your
hand
i
wo
alathea
i
will
seize
it
crippled
as
i
am
and
make
you
obey
me
by
force
if
you
will
not
for
asking
her
whole
face
expressed
furious
resentment
but
she
is
too
sensible
and
level
headed
to
make
a
scene
so
she
gave
me
her
hand
i
put
the
wedding
ring
back
and
the
big
diamond
one
now
you
will
wear
them
until
you
convince
me
of
your
reason
so
thoroughly
that
i
myself
take
them
off
the
bracelets
you
can
do
as
you
like
about
throw
them
away
or
give
them
to
your
maid
and
this
afternoon
i
hope
i
can
count
upon
your
instincts
of
being
a
lady
to
make
you
behave
so
that
no
one
can
chatter
about
us
she
drew
away
her
hand
as
though
my
touch
burnt
her
her
expression
was
contemptuously
haughty
of
course
you
can
count
upon
me
for
this
afternoon
and
she
turned
and
went
out
of
the
room
again
and
now
i
am
waiting
for
her
to
come
back
dressed
for
the
reception
it
is
ten
minutes
to
four
the
volcano
upon
which
we
are
living
can
not
go
on
simmering
much
longer
there
is
bound
to
be
an
explosion
soon
things
are
developing
my
bride
and
i
never
spoke
a
word
on
the
way
to
the
hotel
de
courville
she
was
looking
the
most
desirable
morsel
a
man
could
wish
to
present
to
his
friends
the
sable
cloak
and
the
most
perfect
frock
and
hat
her
maid
is
evidently
a
splendid
hairdresser
she
was
of
a
as
maurice
afterwards
told
me
i
had
telephoned
and
broken
the
news
to
him
while
i
was
waiting
for
alathea
to
come
he
was
not
surprised
he
pretended
and
now
that
the
marriage
is
an
accomplished
fact
he
is
too
well
bred
not
to
fall
into
the
attitude
of
delight
about
it
maurice
has
no
intention
of
dropping
me
married
or
single
thus
when
we
arrived
and
went
up
in
the
lift
to
the
we
found
him
among
the
first
to
greet
us
the
duchesse
kissed
us
both
fondly
and
said
many
pleasant
things
and
having
placed
me
in
a
suitable
chair
brought
everyone
to
me
and
presented
alathea
to
them
all
they
were
the
very
de
la
of
the
faubourg
who
could
be
collected
in
paris
many
are
still
in
the
country
coralie
was
there
with
two
resentful
pinpoints
in
her
clever
little
eyes
but
the
most
gracious
words
on
her
lips
they
none
of
them
could
find
fault
with
the
appearance
of
my
wife
nor
her
manner
she
has
the
ways
of
the
like
the
duchesse
i
could
see
that
she
was
having
a
huge
success
while
everything
seemed
to
be
going
beautifully
and
all
the
company
had
gone
on
into
another
small
where
the
was
my
dear
old
friend
came
to
me
it
is
not
progressing
nicholas
there
is
some
screw
very
loose
duchesse
she
absolutely
hates
me
and
wants
to
go
and
live
out
of
the
flat
she
is
jealous
of
some
one
nicholas
it
is
not
possible
that
you
have
still
i
did
not
grow
angry
no
indeed
that
is
over
long
ago
but
i
do
believe
she
thinks
it
is
not
you
see
the
person
in
question
comes
to
see
a
relative
who
has
married
an
on
the
floor
above
me
and
alathea
has
seen
her
on
the
stairs
and
imagines
she
comes
to
see
me
and
you
can
not
tell
her
i
am
not
supposed
to
know
it
would
matter
to
her
do
you
really
love
the
child
nicholas
with
my
whole
heart
i
only
want
her
in
all
the
world
and
she
is
being
impossible
for
you
surely
i
know
her
character
if
she
thinks
you
have
a
mistress
her
pride
is
of
it
is
indeed
the
duchesse
laughed
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
dear
boy
imagine
though
what
i
have
discovered
that
infamous
father
took
that
money
that
you
gave
when
the
affair
had
already
been
settled
by
harcourt
with
your
money
a
relation
of
mine
attested
at
the
investigation
and
had
to
know
the
facts
nicholas
you
you
paid
twice
and
never
said
a
word
you
are
of
a
devotion
it
was
splendid
of
you
but
my
poor
hilda
is
heartbroken
that
you
have
been
so
pillaged
at
that
moment
the
crowd
returned
from
the
other
room
and
the
duchesse
rose
and
left
me
coralie
now
sat
with
me
nicholas
she
is
lovely
but
what
a
fox
thou
am
i
not
it
is
so
delicious
to
find
things
out
for
oneself
coralie
laughed
she
has
a
philosophic
spirit
as
i
have
found
always
those
much
ones
possess
she
accepts
my
defection
and
again
looks
to
the
main
chance
to
see
how
she
can
benefit
by
it
at
last
the
whole
thing
was
over
and
maurice
and
i
had
a
cigarette
together
in
the
tea
room
people
would
be
crazy
simply
crazy
my
dear
chap
about
alathea
he
told
me
she
was
how
right
i
had
been
how
fortunate
i
was
when
was
i
going
to
england
he
said
farewells
after
this
and
once
more
and
i
were
alone
in
the
brougham
alathea
wore
her
mask
having
been
received
now
as
my
wife
and
by
the
duchesse
whom
she
loves
and
respects
she
knows
she
can
not
go
on
suggesting
she
will
not
live
in
the
flat
with
me
she
can
not
bring
herself
to
speak
about
suzette
because
the
inference
would
be
that
she
objects
i
wondered
if
the
duchesse
had
been
able
to
say
anything
to
her
she
did
not
speak
at
all
and
went
straight
to
her
room
when
we
arrived
it
was
five
minutes
past
eight
when
she
came
in
to
the
i
am
sorry
if
i
have
kept
you
waiting
were
her
first
words
at
dinner
we
spoke
ceremoniously
of
the
party
and
when
we
went
back
to
the
salon
she
went
straight
to
the
piano
and
played
divinely
for
an
hour
the
music
soothed
me
i
felt
less
angry
and
disturbed
wo
you
come
over
and
speak
now
i
called
in
a
pause
and
she
came
over
and
sat
down
do
let
us
talk
she
said
i
am
trying
to
adjust
things
in
my
mind
i
want
to
go
to
my
mother
if
you
will
agree
she
is
ill
again
and
has
not
been
able
to
start
from
there
i
will
tell
you
if
i
can
force
myself
to
keep
on
with
it
or
no
i
can
not
understand
why
it
should
be
so
difficult
the
idea
did
not
affright
you
when
we
first
talked
of
it
you
voluntarily
accepted
the
proposal
made
your
bargain
promised
to
stick
to
it
and
here
after
three
days
you
are
trying
to
break
out
and
are
insinuating
that
the
circumstances
are
too
horrible
for
you
to
continue
bearing
it
surely
your
reason
and
common
sense
must
tell
you
that
your
behaviour
is
grotesque
the
same
agitation
which
always
shows
when
we
talk
thus
overcame
her
again
she
did
not
speak
i
could
understand
it
better
if
you
were
a
hysterical
character
you
did
not
seem
to
be
so
but
now
no
ridiculous
school
miss
of
romance
could
be
more
given
to
the
vapours
you
will
absolutely
destroy
the
remaining
respect
i
have
for
you
unless
you
tell
me
the
truth
and
what
is
underneath
in
your
mind
influencing
you
to
behave
so
childishly
this
stung
her
to
the
quick
as
i
had
meant
that
it
should
she
bounded
up
well
i
will
then
i
hate
being
in
the
house
with
your
mistress
she
was
trembling
all
over
and
as
white
as
marble
i
leaned
back
and
laughed
softly
my
joy
was
so
immense
i
could
not
help
it
to
begin
with
i
have
no
mistress
but
if
i
had
how
can
it
possibly
matter
to
you
since
you
hate
me
and
yourself
arranged
to
be
only
my
secretary
you
have
no
mistress
i
could
see
she
thought
i
was
lying
ignobly
i
had
one
as
of
course
you
know
but
the
moment
i
began
to
think
that
you
might
be
an
agreeable
companion
i
parted
from
her
at
the
time
when
you
saw
the
counterfoils
in
the
and
changed
to
me
from
that
moment
then
she
still
looked
incredulous
she
has
a
cousin
living
in
the
flat
above
married
to
an
she
comes
to
see
her
you
have
no
doubt
met
on
the
stairs
and
on
our
wedding
day
she
came
in
here
not
knowing
to
thank
me
for
a
villa
i
had
given
her
at
monte
carlo
as
a
present
i
am
very
angry
that
she
intruded
and
it
shall
never
happen
again
is
this
true
she
was
breathless
that
made
me
angry
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
lying
i
said
haughtily
la
and
her
lips
curled
she
came
in
while
you
were
at
malo
she
inferred
you
had
not
parted
then
that
was
because
she
was
jealous
and
is
very
temperamental
i
had
thought
that
quality
was
confined
to
her
class
i
too
can
hit
hard
when
i
am
insulted
alathea
flashed
at
me
she
was
beginning
to
realize
that
she
was
at
a
disadvantage
you
are
not
unutterably
shocked
that
i
should
have
had
a
friend
are
you
her
face
grew
contemptuous
no
my
father
had
one
men
are
all
beasts
they
may
be
in
the
abstract
but
are
not
when
they
can
find
a
woman
worth
love
and
respect
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
my
mother
is
an
angel
now
that
your
mind
is
at
rest
as
to
this
question
have
you
any
other
cause
of
complaint
against
me
though
why
it
should
matter
to
you
what
i
do
or
do
do
in
this
respect
as
long
as
i
am
courteous
to
you
and
fulfill
my
side
of
the
bargain
i
can
not
think
one
could
imagine
you
were
jealous
jealous
she
flared
furiously
jealous
i
how
one
has
to
care
to
be
jealous
and
then
she
flounced
out
of
the
room
yes
even
when
they
appear
all
that
is
balanced
there
is
nothing
so
amazing
as
a
woman
xxvi
i
slept
last
night
soundly
for
some
strange
reason
and
woke
quite
late
on
sunday
morning
one
frequently
has
some
sense
of
depression
or
some
sense
of
exhaltation
before
one
is
quite
conscious
and
quite
often
can
not
account
for
either
state
presumably
alathea
had
left
me
full
of
contemptuous
indifference
but
i
awoke
with
a
feeling
of
joy
and
satisfaction
which
gradually
changed
to
flatness
when
i
became
fully
aware
of
things
for
indeed
what
reason
had
i
for
great
rejoicing
none
except
that
the
menace
of
the
suzette
bogie
may
be
lifted
i
rang
for
burton
it
was
nine
has
her
ladyship
breakfasted
yet
burton
her
ladyship
breakfasted
at
eight
and
left
the
house
at
sir
nicholas
my
heart
sank
so
i
was
going
to
have
a
lonely
morning
she
had
said
she
wanted
to
go
to
her
mother
i
remembered
now
i
did
not
hurry
to
get
up
the
doctors
were
coming
with
the
wonderful
artist
who
is
making
my
new
foot
at
twelve
and
i
am
to
have
it
on
for
the
first
time
this
would
be
a
surprise
for
alathea
when
she
returned
to
lunch
i
read
my
journal
in
bed
and
thought
over
the
whole
of
our
acquaintance
yes
certainly
she
has
greatly
changed
in
the
last
six
weeks
and
possibly
i
am
nearer
my
goal
than
i
could
have
dared
to
hope
now
my
method
must
be
to
be
sweet
to
her
and
not
tease
her
any
more
how
wonderful
it
will
be
when
she
does
love
me
i
have
not
thought
much
about
my
own
feelings
lately
she
has
kept
me
so
often
irritated
and
angry
but
i
know
that
there
is
a
steady
advance
and
that
i
love
her
more
than
ever
to
see
her
little
mutinous
rebellious
face
softening
it
will
be
worth
all
the
waiting
but
meanwhile
she
is
out
and
i
had
better
get
up
i
wonder
if
all
the
hundreds
of
other
fellows
who
lost
a
leg
below
the
knee
and
were
cripples
for
eighteen
months
felt
the
same
as
i
did
when
the
new
limb
was
fixed
and
they
stood
upon
two
feet
again
for
the
first
time
a
strange
almost
mad
sense
of
exaltation
filled
me
i
could
walk
i
was
no
longer
a
prisoner
dependent
upon
the
devotion
of
attendants
i
should
no
longer
have
to
have
things
placed
within
reach
and
be
made
to
realize
impotency
it
hurt
and
was
awkward
for
a
but
oh
the
joy
joy
joy
after
the
doctors
and
the
specialist
had
gone
with
hearty
congratulations
my
dear
old
faithful
servant
had
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
dressed
me
you
must
excuse
me
sir
nicholas
but
i
am
so
glad
excuse
him
i
could
have
hugged
him
in
my
own
joy
he
arrayed
me
in
one
of
davies
masterpieces
and
we
both
stood
in
front
of
the
long
glass
in
my
bedroom
and
then
we
solemnly
shook
hands
it
was
too
glorious
i
wanted
to
run
about
i
wanted
to
shout
and
sing
i
played
idiotic
tricks
walking
backwards
and
forwards
like
one
of
penguins
then
i
went
back
to
the
glass
again
actually
whistling
a
tune
except
for
the
black
patch
over
my
eye
i
appeared
very
much
the
same
as
i
used
to
do
before
the
war
my
shoulder
is
practically
straight
now
i
am
a
little
thinner
and
perhaps
my
face
bears
traces
of
suffering
but
in
general
i
do
look
much
altered
i
wonder
what
alathea
will
say
when
she
sees
me
i
wonder
if
it
will
make
any
difference
to
her
morning
they
are
going
to
put
in
my
eye
i
have
not
written
all
this
in
my
journal
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
and
i
had
a
kind
of
superstitious
feeling
that
i
must
not
even
think
of
it
much
less
write
in
case
it
did
not
come
off
but
now
the
moment
has
come
i
am
a
man
again
on
two
feet
hurrah
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
kissed
my
hand
to
a
young
girl
in
the
street
i
wanted
to
call
to
her
i
could
walk
with
you
now
perhaps
soon
i
could
run
she
looked
at
me
with
the
corner
of
her
eye
then
i
planned
how
i
would
surprise
alathea
i
would
be
in
my
bedroom
when
i
knew
she
was
in
the
salon
before
lunch
and
then
i
would
walk
in
i
became
excited
there
was
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
wait
i
tried
to
sit
down
and
settle
to
a
book
but
it
was
useless
the
words
conveyed
no
sense
i
could
not
even
read
the
papers
i
began
listening
to
every
sound
there
were
not
many
things
passing
at
this
time
on
a
sunday
morning
but
of
course
she
was
walking
not
driving
one
struck
she
had
not
returned
burton
came
in
to
ask
if
i
would
postpone
lunch
her
ladyship
did
not
say
when
she
would
be
back
he
said
we
had
better
not
wait
then
i
believe
now
she
told
me
she
would
not
be
in
burton
had
opened
a
pint
of
champagne
on
this
tremendous
occasion
he
felt
i
should
drink
my
own
health
i
had
begun
to
lose
some
of
my
i
wished
she
had
been
here
to
share
it
with
i
have
walked
up
and
down
up
and
down
it
is
four
now
and
she
has
not
returned
no
doubt
her
mother
is
ill
perhaps
perhaps
i
have
spent
a
beastly
day
my
exhilaration
has
all
evaporated
now
i
have
had
no
one
to
share
it
with
me
maurice
and
everyone
is
leaving
me
discreetly
alone
knowing
i
am
supposed
to
be
on
my
honeymoon
honeymoon
i
spent
the
afternoon
waiting
waiting
and
after
tea
when
alathea
had
not
arrived
i
began
taking
longer
turns
walking
up
and
down
the
broad
corridor
and
at
last
i
paused
outside
her
room
and
a
desire
came
over
me
to
look
in
on
it
and
see
how
she
had
arranged
it
there
was
silence
i
listened
a
moment
then
i
opened
the
door
the
fire
was
not
lit
it
all
seemed
cold
and
cheerless
i
turned
on
the
light
except
for
the
and
gold
brushes
and
boxes
i
had
had
put
on
the
dressing
table
for
her
there
was
not
an
indication
that
anyone
stayed
there
none
of
the
usual
things
women
have
about
in
their
rooms
one
could
see
she
looked
upon
it
just
as
an
hotel
and
not
a
permanent
abode
there
were
no
photographs
of
her
family
no
books
of
her
own
nothing
only
the
bracelets
were
on
the
table
still
in
their
case
and
on
looking
nearer
i
saw
there
was
a
bottle
of
scent
it
had
no
label
and
when
i
opened
it
i
smelled
the
exquisite
perfume
of
fresh
roses
that
she
uses
where
does
she
get
it
it
is
the
purest
i
have
ever
smelt
in
my
life
i
looked
at
the
quaint
little
fourpost
bed
that
i
had
found
in
that
shop
at
bath
a
perfect
specimen
of
its
date
about
with
the
old
deep
rose
silk
pressed
over
the
shell
carving
i
had
an
insane
desire
to
open
the
drawers
in
the
chest
and
touch
her
stockings
and
gloves
i
had
a
wild
feeling
altogether
i
wanted
my
love
rebellious
unrelenting
anyhow
i
just
longed
for
her
i
resisted
my
stupidities
and
made
myself
leave
the
room
and
then
tried
to
feel
joy
again
in
my
leg
burton
was
turning
on
the
lamps
when
i
got
back
to
the
salon
there
are
rumours
that
something
is
going
to
happen
sir
nicholas
talk
of
an
armistice
i
heard
when
i
was
out
do
you
think
foch
will
do
it
but
i
know
all
these
rumours
and
talks
we
have
heard
them
before
so
this
did
not
affect
me
i
could
feel
nothing
as
time
went
on
but
a
passionate
ache
why
why
must
she
be
so
cruel
to
me
why
does
she
leave
me
all
alone
alathea
i
would
never
be
so
unkind
to
you
and
yet
i
do
know
if
i
were
jealous
and
angry
as
i
suppose
she
is
i
could
of
course
be
much
crueler
her
ladyship
maid
had
been
given
the
day
out
by
her
mistress
burton
informed
me
so
that
we
could
gain
no
information
from
her
we
waited
until
eight
for
dinner
but
still
my
little
girl
did
not
come
and
in
solemn
state
in
a
white
tie
and
tail
coat
i
dined
alone
in
spite
of
the
champagne
which
burton
again
handed
apprehension
set
in
what
can
have
happened
to
her
has
she
had
an
accident
does
she
mean
never
to
return
are
all
my
calculations
of
no
sense
and
has
she
left
me
forever
in
despair
at
ten
i
telephoned
the
hotel
de
courville
lady
thormonde
had
been
there
in
the
morning
i
was
told
but
the
duchesse
had
left
for
hautevine
at
two
no
one
was
in
the
house
no
they
did
not
know
lady
hilda
bulteel
telephone
number
she
had
no
telephone
they
no
they
did
not
know
the
address
auteuil
and
the
name
bulteel
that
is
all
perhaps
something
could
be
done
on
a
but
on
a
sunday
night
in
war
time
all
was
impossible
and
at
last
in
an
agony
of
doubt
and
apprehension
i
consented
to
retire
to
bed
had
i
made
some
mistake
i
tried
to
remember
she
had
said
she
meant
to
decide
if
she
could
bear
the
situation
or
no
and
that
she
was
going
to
her
mother
she
wanted
to
be
with
her
she
had
been
ill
and
could
not
start
yes
of
course
that
is
it
the
mother
is
ill
and
they
have
no
telephone
i
must
wait
until
the
morning
she
can
not
really
mean
not
to
come
back
in
any
case
she
would
have
let
me
know
but
what
an
agony
of
suspense
burton
came
and
gave
me
my
medicine
when
i
was
in
bed
and
although
i
knew
it
was
a
camouflaged
sleeping
draught
i
drank
it
i
just
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
but
i
only
slept
until
four
and
now
i
am
sitting
up
writing
this
and
i
feel
as
if
every
queer
force
was
abroad
and
that
all
sorts
of
momentous
things
are
oh
when
will
daylight
come
i
was
awakened
by
cannon
i
leaped
from
my
bed
yes
leaped
i
had
been
dreaming
that
a
surprise
party
of
germans
were
attacking
the
trench
and
i
was
just
rallying
the
men
for
a
final
dash
when
heavy
guns
began
a
bombardment
which
was
oh
god
let
me
get
up
and
over
the
top
in
time
wild
with
excitement
i
was
now
wide
awake
yes
there
were
cannons
booming
had
bertha
begun
again
what
was
happening
then
i
heard
murmurs
in
the
street
i
rang
the
bell
violently
i
had
slept
very
late
burton
rushed
in
an
armistice
sir
nicholas
he
cried
joyously
it
true
after
all
an
armistice
oh
god
so
at
last
at
last
we
have
won
and
it
has
not
been
all
in
vain
i
shook
with
emotion
how
utterly
absorbed
in
my
own
affairs
i
had
been
not
to
have
taken
in
that
this
was
coming
george
harcourt
had
telephoned
that
he
had
news
for
me
i
remember
now
while
we
were
at
the
hotel
de
courville
on
saturday
and
i
had
paid
no
attention
i
was
too
excited
all
through
breakfast
to
feel
renewed
anxiety
about
alathea
i
was
accepting
the
fact
that
she
had
stayed
with
her
mother
surely
surely
she
would
be
in
soon
now
the
oculist
and
his
would
be
arriving
soon
at
eleven
if
the
excitement
of
an
armistice
does
not
prevent
them
i
hope
all
that
wo
be
going
on
when
alathea
does
come
in
burton
has
questioned
her
maid
she
knows
nothing
of
miladi
movements
only
that
she
herself
had
been
given
permission
to
go
out
for
the
day
all
the
servants
have
gone
more
or
less
crazy
pierre
hopped
in
just
now
jolly
old
chap
and
in
his
excitement
embraced
me
on
both
cheeks
he
has
a
wooden
stump
not
a
smart
footed
thing
like
mine
but
i
shall
change
all
that
now
antoine
could
not
contain
himself
and
heaven
knows
what
the
underservants
did
i
told
them
all
to
run
out
and
see
what
was
happening
but
pierre
said
no
the
of
monsieur
must
not
be
neglected
time
enough
in
the
afternoon
eleven
came
and
with
it
the
oculist
and
by
luncheon
time
i
had
a
second
blue
eye
but
oh
the
shouting
in
the
streets
and
the
passionate
joy
in
the
air
the
two
men
preened
themselves
upon
keeping
this
appointment
upon
so
great
a
day
and
indeed
my
gratitude
was
deep
but
the
same
gladness
did
not
hold
me
as
when
my
leg
was
given
back
to
me
everything
was
now
swallowed
up
in
an
overwhelming
suspense
what
could
have
kept
alathea
i
walked
to
the
glass
soberly
when
the
doctors
had
gone
eager
to
get
away
and
join
the
rejoicers
and
what
i
saw
startled
me
how
astonishing
the
art
of
these
things
is
now
unless
i
turn
my
glance
in
some
impossible
way
i
have
apparently
two
bright
blue
eyes
with
the
same
lids
and
lashes
the
scrap
of
shrapnel
only
injured
the
orb
itself
and
did
not
touch
the
lid
fortunately
and
the
socket
had
healed
up
miraculously
in
the
last
month
i
am
not
now
a
disgusting
object
perhaps
possibly
yes
can
i
induce
her
to
love
me
soon
but
what
is
the
good
of
it
all
she
has
not
returned
and
now
something
must
be
done
but
on
this
day
of
days
no
one
could
be
found
to
attend
to
anything
shops
were
shut
post
offices
did
not
work
the
city
was
mad
with
rejoicing
at
luncheon
i
ate
gulped
down
my
food
burton
calm
reassured
me
you
do
think
anything
has
happened
do
you
burton
no
sir
nicholas
her
ladyship
is
no
doubt
with
her
family
i
feel
that
anything
is
amiss
her
grace
returns
anyway
and
we
can
hear
for
sure
then
would
you
not
care
to
drive
out
and
see
the
people
sir
it
is
a
day
but
i
told
him
no
he
must
go
they
all
could
go
i
would
wait
in
and
could
now
attend
to
myself
but
i
knew
somehow
that
the
dear
old
boy
would
not
leave
me
the
hours
went
by
the
shouting
grew
louder
as
bands
passed
on
their
way
to
the
to
see
the
cannon
which
i
heard
were
now
dragged
there
burton
came
in
from
time
to
time
to
tell
me
the
news
gathered
from
the
below
i
telephoned
to
maurice
he
was
wild
with
delight
they
were
going
to
have
a
great
dinner
at
the
ritz
and
then
go
and
in
the
streets
with
the
people
would
not
we
join
them
everyone
was
going
odette
telephoned
too
and
daisy
ryven
all
were
rejoicing
and
happy
the
agony
grew
and
grew
what
if
she
means
to
leave
me
and
has
just
disappeared
not
telling
me
on
purpose
to
punish
me
at
this
thought
i
went
frantically
into
her
room
again
and
looked
on
the
the
ring
cases
were
there
in
a
drawer
in
the
william
and
mary
but
no
rings
no
if
she
had
not
meant
to
return
she
would
have
left
them
behind
her
this
gave
me
hope
i
had
the
fire
lit
burton
lit
it
everyone
else
was
out
of
course
the
crowd
has
prevented
her
returning
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
getting
back
from
auteuil
some
of
the
fellows
of
the
supreme
war
council
rang
up
they
were
less
exhilarated
by
the
news
a
pity
they
thought
foch
could
have
entered
berlin
in
a
week
at
last
when
i
had
been
pacing
like
a
restless
tiger
and
twilight
was
coming
i
sank
into
my
chair
overcome
with
the
strain
i
did
not
mean
to
feel
the
drivel
of
self
pity
but
it
is
a
ghastly
thing
to
be
all
alone
and
anxious
when
everyone
else
is
shouting
for
joy
i
was
staring
into
the
fire
i
had
not
had
the
lights
lit
on
purpose
i
wanted
the
soft
shadows
to
soothe
me
burton
had
gone
down
again
to
the
a
bitterness
and
a
melancholy
i
can
not
describe
was
holding
me
of
what
good
my
leg
and
my
eye
if
i
am
to
suffer
torment
once
more
a
sense
of
forsakenness
held
me
perhaps
i
dozed
because
i
was
worn
out
when
suddenly
i
was
conscious
of
a
closing
door
and
opening
my
eye
i
saw
that
alathea
stood
before
me
a
log
fell
and
blazed
brightly
and
i
could
see
that
her
face
was
greatly
moved
i
am
so
sorry
if
you
have
been
burton
says
you
have
i
would
have
been
back
earlier
but
i
was
caught
in
the
crowd
i
reached
out
and
turned
on
the
lamp
near
me
and
when
she
saw
my
eye
and
leg
she
fell
upon
her
knees
at
my
side
oh
nicholas
she
cried
brokenly
and
i
put
out
my
hand
and
took
her
hand
what
a
thing
is
joy
my
heart
beat
madly
the
blood
rushed
in
my
veins
what
was
that
noise
i
heard
in
my
ear
beyond
the
shouting
in
the
street
was
it
the
cooing
which
used
to
haunt
my
dreams
yes
it
was
and
alathea
voice
was
murmuring
in
french
pardon
j
etais
si
bien
ingrate
pardonnez
moi
hein
i
wanted
to
whisper
darling
you
have
returned
nothing
matters
any
more
but
i
controlled
myself
she
must
finally
surrender
first
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
stood
back
to
look
at
me
i
rose
too
and
there
towered
above
her
oh
i
am
so
glad
so
glad
she
said
tremulously
how
wonderful
how
miraculous
it
is
for
this
great
day
i
thought
that
you
had
left
me
altogether
i
was
a
little
breathless
i
was
so
very
sad
now
she
looked
down
nicholas
how
i
loved
to
hear
her
pronounce
my
name
nicholas
i
have
heard
from
my
mother
of
your
great
generosity
you
had
helped
us
without
ever
telling
me
and
then
paid
again
to
stop
my
anxiety
and
again
to
stop
mine
oh
i
am
ashamed
humbled
that
i
have
been
as
i
have
been
to
you
forgive
me
forgive
me
i
ask
you
to
from
my
heart
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
child
come
let
us
sit
down
and
talk
everything
over
and
i
sank
into
the
sofa
and
she
came
beside
me
she
would
not
look
at
me
however
but
her
little
face
was
gentle
and
shy
i
can
not
understand
though
why
you
did
all
that
i
can
not
understand
anything
about
it
you
do
not
love
you
only
wanted
me
for
your
secretary
and
yet
you
paid
over
a
hundred
thousand
francs
the
generosity
is
great
i
gazed
and
gazed
at
her
and
you
hate
me
i
said
as
coolly
as
i
could
and
let
me
buy
you
so
that
you
could
save
your
your
sacrifice
was
immense
suddenly
she
looked
straight
up
at
me
her
eyes
filled
with
passion
so
that
wild
fire
kindled
in
my
blood
nicholas
i
do
not
hate
you
i
took
both
her
hands
and
drew
her
to
me
while
outside
in
the
street
they
were
singing
the
and
yelling
for
joy
alathea
tell
me
the
truth
what
then
do
you
feel
i
do
know
i
wanted
to
murder
suzette
i
could
have
drowned
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
here
in
your
arms
and
with
wild
abandon
she
fell
forward
into
my
fond
embrace
ah
god
the
bliss
of
the
next
few
moments
with
her
soft
lips
pressed
to
mine
then
i
could
not
repeat
often
enough
that
i
loved
her
nor
make
her
tell
me
how
she
loved
me
in
return
afterwards
i
grew
masterful
and
ordered
her
to
recount
to
me
everything
from
the
very
beginning
yes
she
had
been
attracted
by
me
from
the
first
day
but
she
hated
the
friends
i
had
round
me
and
she
did
not
like
the
aimlessness
of
my
life
whenever
i
used
to
be
growing
too
contemptuous
though
nicholas
i
used
to
remember
the
and
then
the
feeling
went
off
but
i
was
growing
angrier
and
angrier
with
myself
because
in
spite
of
believing
you
only
thought
of
me
as
one
of
them
i
could
not
prevent
myself
from
loving
you
there
is
something
about
you
that
made
one
forget
all
about
your
leg
and
your
eye
those
cheques
disgusted
you
and
i
kissed
the
little
curl
by
her
ear
she
was
clasped
close
to
me
that
was
the
beginning
of
my
determination
to
conquer
you
and
have
you
for
my
own
she
caressed
my
hair
i
adore
thick
hair
nicholas
she
whispered
but
now
you
have
had
enough
flattery
i
am
off
to
dress
she
struggled
and
pretended
she
wanted
to
leave
me
but
i
would
not
let
her
go
only
when
i
please
and
at
a
price
i
want
to
show
you
that
you
have
a
husband
who
in
spite
of
a
wooden
leg
and
a
glass
eye
is
a
powerful
brute
i
love
you
strong
like
that
she
cooed
her
eyes
soft
with
passion
again
i
am
not
good
really
or
austere
or
cold
and
i
knew
it
was
true
as
she
paid
the
toll
presently
i
made
her
let
me
come
and
choose
which
frock
she
was
to
put
on
for
dinner
and
i
insisted
that
i
should
stay
and
see
her
hair
being
brushed
and
the
maid
henriette
with
her
french
eye
beamed
upon
us
understandingly
while
burton
almost
blubbered
with
happiness
when
i
told
him
his
ladyship
and
i
were
friends
again
i
knew
it
sir
nicholas
if
you
just
made
a
fuss
of
her
how
right
he
was
what
a
dinner
we
had
gay
as
two
children
fond
and
foolish
as
sweethearts
always
are
and
then
the
afterwards
let
us
go
and
see
the
streets
my
little
love
implored
i
feel
that
we
should
shout
our
divine
happiness
with
the
crowd
but
when
we
went
out
on
the
balcony
to
investigate
we
saw
that
would
be
impossible
i
am
not
yet
steady
enough
on
my
feet
to
have
faced
that
throng
so
we
stood
there
and
sang
and
cheered
with
them
as
they
swept
on
towards
the
de
and
gradually
a
delirious
intoxication
held
us
both
and
i
drew
her
back
into
the
softly
lighted
room
lover
she
whispered
as
she
melted
into
my
arms
and
all
i
answered
was
soul
of
mine
and
now
i
know
what
the
whole
of
those
verses
mean
and
so
this
journal
is
done
