chapter
i
if
i
did
tell
this
nobody
else
ever
would
certainly
not
diana
nor
major
vandyke
still
less
eagle
himself
i
mean
captain
eagleston
march
and
they
and
i
are
the
only
ones
who
know
except
a
few
such
people
as
presidents
and
secretaries
of
war
and
generals
who
never
tell
anything
even
under
torture
besides
there
is
the
unofficial
part
without
that
the
drama
would
be
like
a
play
in
three
acts
with
the
first
and
third
acts
chopped
off
the
presidents
and
secretaries
of
war
and
generals
know
nothing
about
the
unofficial
part
it
strange
how
the
biggest
things
of
life
grow
out
of
the
tiniest
ones
there
the
old
simile
of
the
acorn
and
the
oak
for
instance
but
oaks
take
a
long
time
to
grow
and
everybody
concerned
in
oak
culture
is
calmly
expecting
them
to
do
it
imagine
an
acorn
exploding
to
let
out
an
oak
huge
enough
to
shadow
the
world
if
two
years
ago
when
i
was
sixteen
i
had
wanted
money
to
buy
a
white
frock
with
roses
on
it
which
i
saw
in
selfridge
window
a
secret
crisis
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
would
have
been
avoided
and
the
career
of
a
splendid
soldier
would
not
have
been
broken
one
month
before
i
met
the
white
dress
diana
and
father
and
i
had
come
from
home
that
ballyconal
to
see
what
good
we
could
do
with
a
season
in
london
good
for
diana
i
mean
and
i
put
her
before
father
because
he
does
so
himself
every
one
else
he
puts
far
far
behind
like
the
beasts
following
noah
into
the
ark
not
that
i
sure
without
looking
them
up
that
they
did
follow
noah
but
if
it
had
been
father
he
would
have
arranged
it
in
that
way
to
escape
seeing
their
ugly
faces
or
smelling
those
who
were
not
nice
to
smell
i
suppose
i
should
have
been
left
at
ballyconal
with
nothing
to
do
but
study
my
beloved
french
and
spanish
my
sole
accomplishments
only
father
had
contrived
to
let
the
place
through
the
new
york
to
an
american
family
who
poor
dears
snapped
it
up
by
cable
from
the
description
in
the
advertisement
of
a
wonderful
xii
century
castle
besides
diana
could
afford
a
maid
and
that
why
i
was
taken
to
america
afterward
i
can
do
hair
beautifully
so
when
one
thinks
back
fate
had
begun
to
weave
a
web
long
before
the
making
of
that
white
dress
none
of
those
tremendous
things
would
have
happened
to
change
heaven
knows
how
many
lives
if
i
had
been
born
with
the
knack
of
a
hairdresser
inherited
perhaps
from
some
bourgeoise
ancestress
of
mine
on
mother
side
when
the
american
family
found
out
what
ballyconal
was
really
like
and
the
rats
had
crept
out
from
the
hinterland
of
the
old
wainscoting
rich
in
ancient
oak
the
advertisement
stated
to
scamper
over
its
faces
by
night
and
door
knobs
had
come
off
in
its
hands
by
day
or
torn
carpets
had
tripped
it
up
and
sprained
its
ankles
it
said
bad
words
about
deceitful
irish
earls
and
fled
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
having
paid
for
two
months
in
advance
at
the
rate
of
guineas
a
week
father
had
been
sadly
sure
that
the
americans
would
do
that
very
thing
so
he
had
counted
on
getting
only
the
advance
money
and
no
more
this
meant
cheap
lodgings
for
us
which
spoiled
diana
chances
from
the
start
as
she
told
father
the
minute
she
saw
the
house
it
was
in
a
fairly
good
neighbourhood
and
the
address
looked
fashionable
on
paper
but
man
and
especially
girl
may
not
live
on
neighbourhood
and
paper
alone
even
if
the
latter
can
be
peppered
with
coronets
i
do
know
what
curse
or
mildew
collects
on
poor
irish
earls
but
it
simply
goes
nowhere
to
be
one
in
london
and
then
there
was
the
handicap
of
father
two
quaint
marriages
diana
mother
was
a
artiste
is
that
the
word
without
any
money
except
what
she
earned
and
also
i
heard
a
woman
say
once
when
she
thought
little
pitcher
ears
were
engaged
elsewhere
without
any
h
except
in
the
wrong
places
my
mother
the
poor
darling
must
have
been
just
as
unsuitable
in
her
way
she
was
a
french
chocolate
heiress
whom
father
married
to
mend
the
family
fortunes
when
diana
was
five
but
some
one
shortly
after
sprang
on
the
market
a
better
chocolate
than
her
people
made
so
she
was
a
failure
too
and
not
even
beautiful
like
diana
mother
luckily
for
her
she
died
when
i
was
born
but
neither
she
nor
the
artiste
can
have
helped
father
much
with
the
smart
friends
of
his
young
days
when
he
was
one
of
the
bachelors
in
town
diana
was
considered
beautiful
but
the
image
of
her
mother
by
those
inconvenient
creatures
who
run
around
the
world
remembering
other
people
pasts
and
though
she
and
father
were
invited
to
lots
of
big
crushes
they
were
asked
to
any
of
the
charming
intimate
things
which
diana
says
are
the
right
background
for
a
débutante
this
went
to
heart
and
father
liver
and
made
them
both
dreadfully
hard
to
get
on
with
cinderella
was
in
it
with
me
except
that
when
they
were
beastly
i
was
beastly
back
again
a
relief
to
which
cinderella
probably
did
treat
herself
being
a
heroine
stuffed
with
virtues
as
a
sultana
cake
is
stuffed
with
plums
the
day
i
asked
father
for
the
white
frock
with
roses
on
it
in
selfridge
window
he
was
so
disagreeable
that
i
went
to
my
room
and
slammed
the
door
and
kicked
a
chair
it
was
true
that
i
did
not
need
the
dress
because
i
never
went
anywhere
and
was
only
a
flapper
it
almost
more
unpleasant
to
be
called
a
flapper
than
a
mouth
to
feed
still
the
real
pleasure
of
having
a
thing
is
when
you
do
need
it
but
just
want
it
the
farther
away
from
me
that
gown
seemed
to
recede
the
more
i
longed
for
it
and
when
father
told
me
not
to
nag
or
be
a
little
idiot
i
determined
that
somehow
or
other
by
hook
or
crook
the
frock
should
hang
on
my
wall
behind
the
chintz
curtain
which
calls
itself
a
wardrobe
the
morning
of
the
refusal
father
and
di
were
starting
off
to
be
away
all
that
day
and
night
they
were
asked
to
a
ridiculous
house
party
given
by
a
rich
suburban
pickle
family
at
epsom
for
the
derby
and
di
had
been
grumbling
that
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
invitation
they
get
for
one
night
and
the
derby
instead
of
ascot
however
it
was
the
time
of
the
month
for
a
moon
and
quite
decent
young
men
had
been
enticed
so
di
was
so
very
sorry
for
herself
after
all
her
nickname
at
home
in
ireland
diana
the
huntress
had
been
already
imported
free
of
duty
to
england
by
a
discarded
flirtée
but
i
think
she
minded
it
sounded
so
dashing
even
if
it
was
only
grasping
she
went
off
moderately
happy
and
i
was
left
with
hours
on
my
hands
to
decide
by
what
hook
or
what
crook
i
could
possibly
annex
the
dress
which
i
felt
had
been
born
for
me
at
last
i
thought
of
a
way
that
might
do
my
poor
little
chocolate
mother
made
a
will
the
day
before
she
died
when
i
was
a
week
old
leaving
everything
she
possessed
to
me
of
course
her
money
was
all
gone
because
she
had
been
married
for
two
years
to
father
and
himself
is
a
very
expensive
man
but
he
had
spent
her
jewels
yet
nor
her
wedding
veil
nor
a
few
other
pieces
of
lace
since
then
he
wheedled
most
of
the
jewellery
out
of
me
but
the
wedding
veil
i
mean
to
keep
always
and
a
point
scarf
and
some
handkerchiefs
he
has
probably
forgotten
i
had
forgotten
them
too
but
when
i
was
racking
my
brain
how
to
get
the
selfridge
dress
the
remembrance
tumbled
down
off
its
dusty
little
shelf
the
legacies
were
at
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
because
it
was
simpler
to
bring
them
away
from
ballyconal
than
find
a
stowaway
place
that
the
american
family
would
need
for
its
belongings
the
veil
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
part
with
but
the
scarf
was
so
old
i
felt
sure
it
must
have
come
to
my
mother
from
a
succession
of
chocolate
or
perhaps
soap
or
sardine
grandmammas
and
i
had
much
sentiment
about
it
i
had
no
precise
idea
what
the
lace
ought
to
be
worth
but
i
fancied
point
must
be
valuable
and
i
thought
i
ought
to
get
more
than
enough
by
selling
it
to
buy
the
white
dress
which
cost
seven
guineas
taxying
through
wardour
street
with
di
i
had
often
noticed
an
antique
shop
appropriately
crusted
with
the
grime
of
centuries
all
but
the
polished
window
where
lace
and
china
and
bits
of
old
silver
were
displayed
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
person
intelligent
enough
to
combine
odds
and
ends
with
such
fetching
effect
ought
to
be
the
man
to
appreciate
my
great
or
great
scarf
i
did
run
to
taxis
when
alone
and
would
as
soon
have
got
into
one
of
those
appalling
motor
buses
as
leap
on
to
the
back
of
a
mad
elephant
that
had
berserkered
out
of
the
zoo
consequently
i
had
to
walk
it
was
an
untidy
badly
dusted
day
with
a
hot
wind
and
i
realized
when
i
caught
sight
of
myself
in
a
convex
mirror
in
the
window
that
i
looked
rather
like
a
small
female
edition
of
strumpelpeter
there
was
a
bell
on
the
door
which
like
a
shrill
disparaging
announced
me
and
made
me
suddenly
it
occurred
to
me
before
that
there
was
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
or
frightened
about
in
my
errand
i
vaguely
pictured
the
shopman
as
a
dear
old
dickensy
thing
who
would
take
a
fussy
interest
in
me
and
my
scarf
and
who
would
with
a
fatherly
manner
press
upon
me
a
handful
of
sovereigns
or
a
banknote
but
as
the
bell
jangled
one
of
the
most
repulsive
men
i
ever
saw
looked
toward
the
door
there
was
another
man
in
the
place
talking
to
the
first
creature
and
he
looked
up
too
not
even
the
blindest
bat
however
could
have
mistaken
him
for
a
shopkeeper
and
his
being
there
put
not
only
a
different
complexion
on
the
business
but
on
me
i
felt
mine
turning
bright
pink
instead
of
the
usual
cream
that
accompanies
the
hair
and
eyes
with
which
i
advertise
the
industry
of
my
french
ancestors
the
shopman
stared
at
me
with
a
sulky
look
exactly
like
that
of
nebuchadnezzar
our
boar
pig
from
yorkshire
which
took
a
prize
for
its
nose
or
something
this
person
might
have
won
a
prize
for
his
nose
also
if
an
offer
had
been
going
for
large
ones
the
rest
of
his
face
olive
green
and
fat
was
in
the
perspective
of
this
nose
just
as
the
lesser
proportions
of
his
body
such
as
chest
and
legs
were
in
the
perspective
of
his
waist
the
shop
was
much
smaller
than
i
had
expected
from
the
window
a
place
you
might
have
swung
a
cat
in
without
giving
it
concussion
of
the
brain
but
not
a
lion
and
the
men
the
fat
proprietor
and
his
long
lean
customer
and
two
suits
of
armour
seemed
almost
to
fill
it
i
heard
an
actor
talk
about
a
theatre
being
so
tiny
he
was
on
the
audience
and
these
two
were
on
theirs
the
audience
being
me
i
was
so
close
to
the
fat
one
that
i
could
see
the
crumbs
on
the
folds
of
his
waistcoat
like
food
stored
on
cupboard
shelves
i
took
such
a
dislike
to
him
that
i
felt
inclined
to
bounce
out
as
quickly
as
i
had
bounced
in
but
the
door
had
banged
mechanically
behind
me
as
if
to
stop
the
bell
at
any
cost
the
shop
smelt
of
moth
powder
old
leather
musty
paper
and
hair
oil
well
my
little
girl
what
do
you
want
inquired
nebuchadnezzar
with
the
kind
of
lisp
that
turns
a
rat
into
a
yat
little
girl
indeed
to
be
called
a
little
girl
by
a
thing
like
that
and
asked
what
i
wanted
in
that
hebrew
tone
made
me
boil
for
half
a
second
then
suddenly
i
saw
that
it
was
funny
and
i
almost
giggled
as
i
imagined
myself
haughtily
explaining
that
i
had
reached
the
age
of
sixteen
to
say
nothing
of
being
the
daughter
of
two
or
three
hundred
earls
i
did
care
a
tuppenny
anything
whether
he
mistook
me
for
nine
or
ninety
but
i
did
begin
to
feel
that
it
would
be
pleasant
unrolling
my
parcel
and
bargaining
for
money
under
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
other
man
they
were
very
nice
eyes
and
ears
already
i
had
time
to
notice
that
for
even
in
these
days
when
men
are
supposed
to
be
as
indispensable
to
females
as
they
were
in
edwardian
or
victorian
and
earlier
ages
i
do
think
it
entirely
obsolete
for
a
girl
to
learn
more
about
a
man
looks
in
three
seconds
than
she
picks
up
about
another
frock
in
two
this
man
was
what
most
girls
of
sixteen
would
call
young
but
i
am
different
from
most
girls
because
i
always
had
to
be
a
sort
of
law
unto
myself
in
order
not
to
become
a
family
footstool
i
had
to
make
up
my
mind
about
everything
or
risk
my
brain
degenerating
into
a
bath
sponge
and
one
of
the
things
i
made
it
up
about
early
was
that
i
like
boys
or
nuts
the
customer
in
the
curiosity
shop
to
whom
the
proprietor
was
showing
perfect
ducks
of
chelsea
lambs
plastered
against
green
chelsea
bushes
was
maybe
or
thirty
a
great
age
for
a
woman
but
not
so
bad
for
a
man
and
i
wished
to
goodness
he
would
buy
or
not
buy
a
lamb
and
go
forth
about
other
business
however
i
could
indefinitely
delay
answering
that
question
addressed
to
little
girl
i
want
to
show
you
a
scarf
i
snapped
understudy
squeezed
himself
out
from
behind
the
counter
and
lumbered
a
step
or
two
nearer
me
moving
not
straight
ahead
but
from
side
to
side
as
tables
do
for
spiritualists
we
do
mend
lace
here
if
that
what
you
come
for
my
child
he
patronized
me
it
does
need
to
be
mended
said
i
it
beautiful
lace
it
to
be
sold
oa
oh
he
exploded
with
a
cockney
drawl
and
a
rude
look
coming
into
his
eyes
which
he
kept
out
while
there
was
hope
that
the
dusty
little
thing
might
turn
into
a
customer
well
let
see
but
i
got
more
old
lace
on
hand
now
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
as
i
unrolled
layers
of
tissue
paper
which
seemed
to
rustle
loudly
out
of
sheer
spite
i
was
conscious
that
the
customer
had
sauntered
away
as
far
as
possible
and
was
gazing
at
some
old
prints
on
the
wall
which
gave
him
an
excuse
to
turn
his
back
to
us
i
thought
this
sweetly
tactful
of
him
nebuchadnezzar
over
the
shop
he
calls
himself
franks
the
sort
of
noncommittal
name
a
jacobs
or
wolfstein
likes
to
hide
under
almost
snatched
the
lace
from
my
hands
as
i
opened
the
package
shook
out
its
folds
held
it
close
to
his
eyes
pawed
it
and
sniffed
humph
he
grunted
ungraciously
same
old
thing
as
usual
if
i
got
one
of
i
got
a
dozen
what
did
you
expect
to
ask
for
it
ten
pounds
i
announced
as
bold
as
one
of
those
lions
that
could
not
be
swung
in
his
shop
ten
pounds
i
do
know
whether
the
sound
he
made
was
meant
for
a
snort
or
a
laugh
ten
grandmothers
yes
said
i
flaring
up
as
if
he
struck
a
match
on
me
that
just
it
ten
of
my
grandmothers
have
worn
this
scarf
since
it
was
made
and
i
want
a
pound
for
each
of
them
there
was
a
small
funny
noise
behind
me
like
a
staunched
giggle
and
i
glanced
over
my
shoulder
at
the
customer
but
his
back
looked
most
calm
and
inoffensive
you
have
to
take
it
out
in
wanting
i
afraid
my
girl
returned
the
shopkeeper
i
can
offer
you
thirty
bob
no
more
and
no
less
all
the
thing
worth
to
me
i
tried
to
pull
the
scarf
out
of
his
hands
but
he
did
seem
ready
to
give
it
up
it
worth
a
great
deal
more
to
me
i
said
i
carry
it
away
somewhere
else
where
they
about
old
lace
my
word
you
a
pert
young
piece
for
your
size
remarked
the
horrible
man
and
though
i
could
have
boxed
his
ears
which
stood
out
exactly
like
the
handles
on
an
urn
i
felt
my
own
tingle
because
it
was
what
he
said
i
was
a
pert
young
piece
holding
my
own
at
home
and
lots
of
other
things
in
life
for
sixteen
years
of
life
seem
fearfully
long
if
they
all
you
got
behind
you
had
made
me
pert
and
i
did
love
myself
for
it
any
more
than
a
porcupine
can
be
really
fond
of
his
own
quills
i
could
bear
somehow
that
the
man
with
the
nice
eyes
should
be
hearing
me
called
a
pert
piece
and
thinking
me
one
quite
a
smart
repartee
came
into
my
head
but
a
heavy
feeling
in
my
heart
kept
me
from
putting
it
into
words
and
nebuchadnezzar
went
grunting
on
i
know
as
much
about
old
lace
as
any
man
in
this
street
if
not
in
town
that
why
i
do
offer
more
give
me
back
my
scarf
please
was
my
only
answer
in
quite
a
small
voice
still
he
held
on
to
the
lace
look
here
miss
said
he
in
a
changed
tone
how
did
you
come
to
get
hold
of
this
bit
of
property
anyhow
folks
ai
in
the
habit
of
sending
their
children
out
to
dispose
their
valuables
how
can
i
tell
that
you
ai
nicked
this
off
your
mother
or
your
aunt
or
some
other
dame
who
does
know
you
out
if
i
was
doin
my
dooty
i
should
wonder
if
i
ought
to
call
in
the
police
you
horrid
horrid
person
i
flung
at
him
you
trying
to
frighten
me
to
blackmail
me
into
selling
you
my
lace
for
thirty
shillings
when
maybe
it
worth
twenty
times
that
but
if
any
one
calls
the
police
it
will
be
me
to
give
you
in
charge
for
for
intimidation
almost
before
i
had
time
to
be
proud
of
the
word
when
i
contrived
to
get
it
out
the
customer
had
detached
himself
from
the
prints
and
intervened
i
beg
your
pardon
for
interfering
he
said
to
me
not
to
nebuchadnezzar
but
i
ca
help
wondering
and
he
smiled
a
perfectly
disarming
smile
if
you
are
rather
young
to
be
a
business
woman
on
your
own
account
will
you
let
me
see
the
lace
of
course
the
shopkeeper
gave
it
up
to
him
instantly
shamefaced
at
realizing
that
his
customer
instead
of
admiring
his
smart
methods
was
entering
the
lists
against
him
while
my
champion
i
felt
sure
somehow
that
he
was
my
champion
at
heart
took
the
scarf
in
his
hands
and
began
trying
to
look
wise
over
it
i
had
about
seconds
in
which
to
look
at
him
even
at
first
glance
i
had
thought
him
nice
but
now
i
decided
that
he
was
the
nicest
man
i
had
ever
seen
not
the
handsomest
i
do
mean
that
for
our
county
in
ireland
is
celebrated
for
its
handsome
men
both
high
and
low
also
i
seen
several
dreams
since
we
came
to
london
but
well
just
the
because
it
was
the
middle
of
the
season
and
he
was
in
tweeds
i
fancied
that
he
did
go
in
for
being
smart
i
learned
enough
already
about
london
ways
to
understand
as
much
as
that
but
all
the
same
i
thought
that
he
had
the
air
of
a
soldier
and
he
had
such
a
contradictory
sort
of
face
that
it
interested
me
immensely
wondering
what
the
contradictions
meant
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
when
i
came
into
the
shop
i
noticed
that
and
had
been
pleased
and
now
i
saw
that
the
upper
part
of
his
forehead
was
very
white
and
the
rest
of
his
face
very
tanned
as
if
his
complexion
had
slipped
down
he
had
almost
hair
which
seemed
lighter
than
it
was
because
of
his
sunburned
skin
and
his
eyebrows
and
the
eyelashes
lowered
while
he
gazed
at
my
lace
were
two
or
three
shades
darker
they
were
long
arched
brows
that
gave
a
look
of
dreamy
romance
to
the
upper
part
of
his
face
but
the
lower
part
was
extremely
determined
perhaps
even
obstinate
it
jumped
into
my
head
that
a
woman
even
a
fascinator
like
diana
would
never
be
able
to
make
him
change
his
mind
about
things
or
do
things
he
did
wish
to
do
that
was
one
of
the
contradictions
and
the
nose
was
another
it
was
rather
a
roman
sort
of
nose
and
looked
aggressive
as
if
it
would
be
searching
about
for
forlorn
hopes
to
fight
for
anyhow
as
if
it
must
fight
at
all
costs
then
contradicting
the
nose
was
the
mouth
for
he
was
as
all
young
men
ought
to
be
and
not
leave
too
much
to
our
imagination
a
mouth
somehow
like
a
boy
affectionate
and
kind
and
gay
though
far
from
being
weak
i
did
know
what
to
make
of
him
at
all
and
of
course
i
liked
him
the
better
for
that
i
think
this
is
mighty
fine
lace
he
pronounced
when
he
had
studied
it
long
enough
to
show
off
as
a
connoisseur
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
realized
that
he
was
an
american
diana
had
collected
two
american
friends
who
often
invited
her
to
the
savoy
and
i
heard
them
and
no
one
else
say
mighty
fine
are
you
sure
you
want
to
get
rid
of
it
i
thought
he
was
a
dear
to
put
it
like
that
as
if
i
could
have
no
real
need
for
money
but
had
such
a
glut
of
lace
scarves
at
home
that
i
must
rid
myself
of
a
few
superfluous
ones
as
he
spoke
he
was
looking
straight
at
me
with
the
kind
eyes
i
had
noticed
first
of
all
gray
and
yellow
and
brown
mixed
up
together
into
hazel
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
some
quality
in
that
look
which
made
me
decide
instantly
to
tell
him
everything
i
have
suffered
the
torture
of
the
boot
anyhow
for
a
minute
or
two
before
i
would
have
explained
myself
to
nebuchadnezzar
i
sure
i
do
want
to
sell
if
i
can
get
as
much
as
ten
pounds
for
the
thing
i
answered
nothing
less
than
seven
guineas
would
be
of
any
use
to
me
there
something
which
costs
seven
guineas
a
thing
i
dying
to
buy
my
mother
left
this
scarf
to
me
as
well
as
some
other
lace
i
would
sell
for
the
world
but
it
quite
mine
and
i
can
do
as
i
like
with
it
let
me
see
ten
pounds
is
fifty
dollars
is
it
the
man
reflected
out
aloud
i
do
know
i
caught
him
up
anything
about
american
money
or
america
he
smiled
at
me
again
perhaps
i
had
hoped
he
would
that
too
bad
you
ought
to
come
over
on
our
side
and
learn
i
love
to
especially
to
the
parts
where
i
could
show
off
my
french
and
spanish
but
i
sure
i
shall
never
get
the
chance
to
cross
the
sea
i
was
three
thousand
miles
from
dreaming
then
of
all
the
things
that
were
to
come
out
of
this
little
affair
of
the
scarf
and
the
dress
which
had
tempted
me
to
put
my
lace
on
the
market
well
he
went
on
going
back
from
me
to
my
property
i
buy
this
pretty
thing
for
ten
pounds
if
you
like
to
sell
it
to
me
but
honestly
i
warn
you
that
for
all
i
know
it
may
be
worth
a
lot
more
i
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
ten
pounds
i
said
but
i
do
wish
you
to
buy
just
out
of
kindness
when
i
almost
sure
you
do
really
want
to
but
i
do
he
assured
me
i
came
into
this
place
to
carry
out
a
commission
for
an
aunt
of
mine
in
america
she
wrote
and
asked
me
to
find
her
something
in
a
curiosity
shop
in
england
that
she
could
give
for
a
wedding
present
to
a
girl
who
wild
about
antiques
an
old
friend
of
ours
is
going
to
take
the
parcel
back
with
her
when
she
sails
smuggle
it
maybe
but
that
not
my
business
i
thought
of
a
miniature
on
ivory
but
i
have
taken
a
big
fancy
to
anything
seen
so
far
i
like
your
lace
better
and
it
costs
just
the
money
my
aunt
told
me
to
spend
so
there
you
are
and
there
the
lace
i
added
laughing
it
yours
thank
you
very
much
it
for
me
to
thank
you
said
he
i
awfully
afraid
i
getting
the
best
of
the
bargain
though
would
you
rather
go
somewhere
first
and
consult
an
expert
no
indeed
said
i
maybe
the
expert
would
tell
us
the
lace
was
worth
only
five
pounds
not
ten
what
i
in
a
hurry
to
do
is
to
dash
to
selfridge
and
buy
the
dress
i
want
before
some
beast
of
a
girl
gets
it
before
me
oh
horror
maybe
she
there
already
the
worst
of
it
is
said
my
new
friend
i
felt
he
was
that
i
got
the
ten
pounds
on
me
i
meant
to
have
anything
i
might
decide
to
buy
sent
home
and
paid
for
at
my
hotel
ca
i
go
with
you
to
your
hotel
and
you
give
me
the
money
there
i
wanted
to
know
you
see
i
in
such
a
hurry
about
the
dress
he
glanced
at
me
with
a
funny
look
in
his
eyes
and
somehow
i
read
what
it
meant
had
called
me
a
little
girl
and
had
behaved
as
respectfully
as
if
i
were
a
hundred
but
i
could
see
that
he
thought
me
about
twelve
or
thirteen
and
now
he
was
saying
to
himself
no
harm
carting
a
child
like
that
about
without
a
chaperon
this
was
the
first
time
i
ever
been
glad
that
i
had
sacrificed
myself
for
di
and
come
to
london
in
my
old
frocks
up
to
the
tops
of
my
boots
and
my
hair
hanging
in
two
tails
down
to
my
waist
of
course
if
any
one
were
caddish
or
cattish
enough
to
look
her
up
in
the
book
it
could
be
found
out
at
a
glance
that
lady
diana
was
but
even
if
a
person
is
a
cad
or
a
cat
he
or
she
is
often
too
lazy
to
go
through
the
dull
pages
of
debrett
or
burke
and
besides
there
is
seldom
one
of
the
books
handy
therefore
di
had
a
sporting
chance
of
being
taken
for
eighteen
the
sweet
conventional
age
of
a
débutante
on
her
presentation
every
one
did
know
however
that
father
had
married
twice
and
that
there
must
be
a
difference
of
five
or
six
years
between
diana
and
the
chocolate
child
accordingly
if
i
could
be
induced
to
look
thirteen
at
most
it
would
be
useful
as
for
me
i
had
cared
particularly
i
knew
i
should
get
any
fun
in
london
whether
my
hair
were
in
a
tail
or
a
twist
or
whether
my
dresses
were
short
or
long
sometimes
i
had
been
sorry
for
beginning
in
that
way
but
now
i
saw
that
virtue
was
going
to
be
rewarded
all
right
said
my
friend
maybe
it
will
be
the
best
arrangement
and
we
left
nebuchadnezzar
looking
as
the
dog
in
the
fable
must
have
looked
when
he
snapped
at
the
reflected
bit
of
meat
in
the
water
and
lost
the
bit
in
his
mouth
a
taxi
was
passing
and
stopped
at
the
flourish
of
a
cane
i
jumped
in
before
i
could
be
helped
the
man
followed
and
though
i
was
looking
forward
only
to
a
little
fun
my
very
first
adventure
in
london
on
my
own
the
chauffeur
was
speeding
us
along
a
road
that
did
stop
at
the
waldorf
hotel
it
was
a
road
which
would
carry
us
both
on
and
on
toward
a
blazing
bonfire
of
wild
passion
and
romance
chapter
ii
the
first
thing
we
did
when
we
were
in
the
taxicab
was
to
introduce
ourselves
to
each
other
i
told
him
that
i
was
marguerite
but
that
as
i
was
a
bit
like
a
marguerite
or
even
a
common
or
garden
daisy
i
degenerated
into
peggy
i
did
drag
in
anything
about
my
family
tree
it
seemed
unnecessary
he
told
me
that
he
was
eagleston
march
but
that
he
had
degenerated
into
eagle
i
thought
this
nickname
suited
his
aquiline
nose
his
brilliant
eyes
and
that
eager
alert
look
he
had
of
being
alive
in
every
nerve
and
fibre
he
told
me
too
that
he
was
a
captain
in
the
american
army
over
in
england
for
the
first
time
on
leave
but
before
he
got
so
far
i
knew
very
well
who
he
was
for
read
about
him
days
ago
in
father
why
you
the
first
american
who
looped
the
loop
at
hendon
i
cried
out
you
invented
some
stability
thing
or
other
to
put
on
a
monoplane
he
laughed
some
stability
thing
or
other
a
neat
description
but
you
right
i
the
american
fellow
that
the
loop
has
looped
now
i
know
said
i
why
you
not
at
the
derby
horses
at
their
fastest
must
seem
slow
to
a
flying
man
this
time
you
not
right
he
corrected
me
i
not
at
the
derby
because
it
is
much
fun
seeing
a
race
when
you
do
know
anything
about
the
horses
and
have
a
pal
to
go
with
but
you
must
have
lots
of
pals
i
thought
out
aloud
every
one
adores
the
airmen
do
they
i
have
noticed
it
then
you
ca
be
conceited
perhaps
american
men
are
i
never
knew
one
before
except
in
business
good
heavens
so
you
really
are
a
business
woman
as
well
as
a
linguist
apparently
at
what
age
did
you
begin
what
age
do
you
take
me
for
now
i
hedged
about
twelve
or
thirteen
i
suppose
though
i
no
judge
of
ages
whether
they
little
or
big
i
over
twelve
i
confessed
and
went
on
hastily
to
change
the
dangerous
subject
but
i
really
did
have
business
with
an
american
it
was
in
letters
my
father
made
me
write
them
though
they
were
signed
with
his
name
he
hates
writing
letters
i
so
thankful
your
name
trowbridge
i
hope
you
are
related
to
any
trowbridges
not
one
but
why
oh
because
if
you
were
you
might
want
to
throw
me
to
the
wolves
i
mean
under
the
motor
buses
we
done
the
trowbridges
of
chicago
a
fearful
wrong
we
let
them
our
place
in
ireland
while
we
came
to
london
to
enjoy
ourselves
he
laughed
aloud
that
very
nice
young
laugh
of
his
which
made
me
feel
more
at
home
with
him
than
with
people
i
known
all
my
life
you
really
are
a
quaint
little
woman
he
said
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
know
some
people
in
chicago
named
trowbridge
oh
well
said
i
if
you
must
throw
me
out
of
anything
do
it
out
of
your
monoplane
it
would
be
so
much
more
distinguished
than
out
of
a
mere
taxi
and
at
least
i
should
have
flown
first
for
you
would
have
to
take
me
up
before
you
could
dash
me
down
and
so
my
dream
would
have
come
true
is
it
your
dream
to
fly
he
asked
interested
waking
and
sleeping
said
i
ever
since
i
was
a
tiny
child
my
very
best
dream
has
been
that
i
was
flying
even
to
dream
it
asleep
is
perfectly
wonderful
and
thrilling
worth
being
born
for
just
to
feel
what
must
it
be
when
you
actually
awake
you
are
an
enthusiast
said
captain
march
you
got
it
in
your
blood
what
a
pity
you
not
a
boy
you
could
be
a
yourself
well
it
something
to
know
one
said
i
why
i
give
my
hand
the
left
one
or
anyhow
a
finger
of
it
for
just
an
hour
in
the
air
a
toe
would
be
too
cheap
i
take
you
up
like
a
shot
if
your
people
would
let
you
go
said
he
i
gasped
with
joy
oh
you
i
exclaimed
really
and
truly
i
did
mean
to
hint
but
it
would
be
heaven
to
go
not
in
my
he
laughed
for
i
guarantee
to
bring
you
safe
and
sound
back
to
earth
again
this
side
of
heaven
i
can
take
up
one
passenger
though
i
have
yet
since
i
came
out
here
i
met
anybody
till
now
i
particularly
cared
to
ask
and
who
would
particularly
have
cared
to
go
and
you
care
to
take
me
how
kind
of
you
kind
to
myself
i
told
you
i
had
any
pals
in
england
you
seem
to
be
the
stuff
they
made
of
you
be
a
i
sure
but
your
people
people
i
have
any
at
least
a
governess
i
once
had
said
you
could
call
two
they
must
be
spoken
of
as
i
have
only
who
belong
to
me
just
father
and
a
sister
a
they
like
each
other
so
much
that
they
have
room
to
care
about
me
if
the
tipped
me
out
and
smashed
me
as
flat
as
a
paper
doll
they
would
shed
a
tear
poor
little
child
but
maybe
you
mistaken
maybe
are
not
conceited
yes
i
am
that
why
i
notice
when
i
not
loved
oh
take
me
up
take
me
up
i
all
alone
in
the
world
my
have
gone
to
the
derby
and
are
staying
all
night
at
epsom
with
a
fat
rich
family
i
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
landlady
in
our
lodgings
i
even
give
up
the
dress
at
selfridge
to
go
with
you
that
more
than
sacrificing
a
toe
but
he
had
stopped
laughing
instead
he
had
turned
quite
grave
i
could
possibly
do
it
he
said
i
awfully
sorry
to
refuse
if
you
were
older
you
understand
that
it
would
be
the
right
thing
for
a
strange
man
and
a
to
kidnap
a
little
girl
and
fly
off
with
her
into
space
supposing
i
had
an
accident
i
sure
i
should
but
just
supposing
i
should
never
be
able
to
forgive
myself
do
despair
though
if
you
can
manage
to
introduce
me
as
a
respectable
sort
of
chap
to
your
father
and
he
gives
his
permission
but
how
did
i
get
to
know
you
i
groaned
i
shall
have
to
fib
no
you
wo
he
said
quickly
i
refuse
to
be
fibbed
about
you
must
think
of
some
other
way
i
afraid
i
said
dolefully
you
agree
with
that
hateful
curiosity
man
about
me
agree
with
him
i
do
understand
that
i
a
pert
minx
or
something
that
what
he
called
me
or
a
pert
piece
it
all
the
same
thing
and
i
am
it
i
do
mind
telling
fibs
i
told
lots
you
poor
little
thing
exclaimed
captain
march
in
a
pitying
tone
but
with
the
kind
of
pity
the
proudest
person
would
resent
because
it
really
came
from
his
heart
you
seem
to
have
had
to
fight
your
own
battles
maybe
your
mother
died
when
you
were
very
young
when
i
was
a
week
young
i
said
and
suddenly
i
felt
myself
choked
up
that
explains
the
telling
of
fibs
you
see
and
saying
you
mind
though
i
sure
you
do
when
you
stop
to
think
of
it
because
the
sort
of
girl
who
can
be
a
good
pal
to
a
man
just
ca
tell
fibs
any
more
than
the
man
can
if
he
worth
being
a
pal
to
two
boiling
hot
tears
ran
down
my
face
one
on
each
cheek
i
answer
i
only
looked
up
at
him
feeling
all
eyes
what
a
beast
i
am
he
exclaimed
i
made
you
cry
it
i
who
am
the
beast
i
managed
to
gasp
out
because
i
saw
he
was
badly
distressed
about
me
and
what
he
had
done
i
crying
because
a
little
beast
but
i
like
not
to
be
you
not
you
a
little
soldier
will
you
forgive
me
i
did
mean
to
preach
you
did
preach
i
expect
you
talk
like
that
to
a
real
soldier
one
of
those
you
captain
of
well
i
pretend
i
one
of
those
soldiers
and
that
you
my
captain
as
i
spoke
the
taxi
was
drawing
up
in
front
of
his
hotel
but
i
went
straight
on
with
my
play
and
gave
him
a
military
salute
thank
you
captain
said
i
for
taking
an
interest
i
sha
forget
no
more
fibs
i
work
for
my
corporal
stripe
good
child
he
beamed
on
me
looking
young
and
happy
again
i
get
you
the
stripe
i
have
it
ready
for
you
upstairs
i
bring
it
down
when
i
bring
the
money
for
the
lace
scarf
would
you
rather
wait
in
the
taxi
or
will
you
come
into
the
ladies
parlour
in
the
hotel
i
thought
parlour
a
lovely
word
and
very
french
though
i
supposed
it
might
be
american
too
it
was
quite
an
adventure
going
into
an
hotel
my
captain
already
i
begun
to
think
of
him
as
that
since
he
called
me
a
soldier
paid
the
chauffeur
and
led
me
to
a
big
where
several
women
sat
so
prettily
dressed
and
so
trim
that
they
made
me
feel
shabby
in
my
brown
holland
frock
and
my
hair
i
wondered
what
he
had
meant
by
saying
he
would
bring
me
a
stripe
and
whether
he
had
meant
anything
at
all
except
a
passing
joke
somehow
i
felt
that
he
had
had
a
definite
idea
but
i
dream
it
would
be
anything
half
so
fascinating
as
it
turned
out
he
was
not
gone
more
than
five
or
six
minutes
and
when
he
appeared
again
he
drew
up
a
chair
in
front
of
me
deliberately
turning
his
back
to
the
other
occupants
of
the
room
so
that
they
could
not
see
what
was
going
on
then
he
made
me
hold
out
my
hands
i
was
ashamed
of
my
untidy
gloves
and
receive
in
them
ten
golden
sovereigns
which
he
counted
as
they
dropped
into
my
open
palms
i
hope
you
never
regret
bartering
away
your
beautiful
lace
for
this
pittance
said
he
and
now
for
the
corporal
stripe
if
you
going
to
enlist
in
my
regiment
i
am
i
cried
i
enlisted
in
it
already
here
then
and
he
took
from
his
coat
pocket
a
little
ball
of
something
black
and
gold
evidently
thrust
in
with
haste
this
is
one
of
the
chevrons
i
wore
on
my
sleeve
when
i
was
made
corporal
of
cadets
at
west
point
eleven
years
ago
this
very
month
you
laugh
i
guess
when
i
tell
you
why
i
brought
the
thing
with
me
over
here
i
kept
it
out
of
a
sort
of
of
sentiment
or
sentimentality
maybe
because
i
was
so
dashed
proud
when
i
got
it
i
thought
it
marked
an
epoch
in
my
life
that
it
was
a
token
of
success
well
when
i
was
coming
over
to
your
side
of
the
water
to
try
out
the
among
all
the
english
flyers
i
was
silly
enough
to
think
if
she
did
any
good
stick
this
poor
old
stripe
on
her
somewhere
for
auld
lang
syne
now
rather
give
it
to
you
little
soldier
i
think
it
was
at
that
minute
i
began
to
worship
him
i
worshipped
him
as
a
child
worships
and
as
a
woman
worships
too
except
that
perhaps
when
a
woman
lets
herself
go
with
a
flood
of
love
for
a
man
she
unconsciously
expects
some
return
i
sure
i
did
expect
anything
that
would
have
been
too
ridiculous
i
felt
rather
guilty
about
depriving
the
of
her
trophy
but
after
all
a
girl
is
more
appreciative
than
a
monoplane
and
besides
it
would
have
hurt
captain
march
feelings
in
that
mood
of
his
if
i
refused
i
had
a
conviction
that
a
corporal
stripe
given
as
a
reward
and
an
incentive
would
be
to
me
a
talisman
i
decided
that
i
keep
it
in
a
place
where
i
could
rush
to
look
at
it
whenever
i
needed
encouragement
to
go
on
being
a
soldier
if
i
wanted
to
sneak
myself
out
of
trouble
with
a
fib
or
be
snappish
to
father
or
cattish
to
di
or
say
damn
or
bang
a
door
in
a
rage
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
should
only
have
to
think
of
that
little
triangle
of
black
cloth
and
gilt
braid
to
be
suddenly
as
good
as
gold
all
the
way
through
to
my
heart
maybe
i
showed
some
of
these
thoughts
in
my
eyes
when
i
thanked
captain
march
di
says
my
eyes
tell
all
my
secrets
for
he
was
nicer
than
ever
in
the
chivalrous
almost
tender
way
some
men
have
with
he
said
he
was
just
as
lonely
as
i
was
or
worse
because
he
had
a
soul
who
belonged
to
him
in
england
and
would
it
be
quite
proper
and
all
right
for
an
old
soldier
like
him
to
invite
a
little
girl
like
me
to
lunch
of
course
i
said
yes
it
would
be
entirely
proper
and
perfectly
splendid
though
they
might
have
forgotten
to
put
anything
of
the
sort
into
books
of
etiquette
by
that
time
it
was
twelve
only
a
few
minutes
left
to
dash
to
selfridge
and
rescue
the
dress
if
it
was
already
lost
before
luncheon
so
captain
march
offered
to
whisk
me
up
to
the
shop
in
a
taxi
he
promised
if
the
gown
were
gone
that
he
help
me
choose
another
but
it
was
gone
which
showed
that
as
i
felt
in
my
bones
it
really
had
been
born
for
me
why
it
a
party
dress
is
it
my
captain
innocently
wanted
to
know
and
is
it
a
bit
too
old
for
you
i
can
have
it
made
shorter
i
said
and
if
it
is
a
little
too
old
for
me
it
does
matter
because
i
never
invited
to
any
parties
i
be
for
years
if
ever
i
sha
come
out
like
my
sister
di
i
shall
just
slowly
out
with
nobody
noticing
it
is
that
i
expect
to
this
frock
it
the
joy
of
having
it
which
is
so
important
girls
begin
to
be
queer
evidently
even
when
they
children
said
he
but
that
does
make
them
less
interesting
i
know
of
an
invitation
to
a
party
you
have
though
if
you
wanted
it
the
wife
of
our
american
ambassador
is
giving
a
ball
night
i
know
her
a
little
she
be
awfully
pleased
to
send
your
people
cards
for
the
show
if
i
asked
her
or
perhaps
they
had
cards
already
i
shook
my
head
i
sure
they
have
are
you
going
yes
i
accepted
i
know
diana
would
love
it
i
tell
her
about
you
and
about
for
she
ca
be
cross
with
me
if
it
ends
in
an
invitation
and
you
be
her
flying
man
even
as
i
spoke
i
had
a
misgiving
it
came
like
a
cramp
in
the
heart
di
nickname
seemed
to
whisper
itself
in
my
ear
diana
the
huntress
diana
the
huntress
i
did
want
her
to
shoot
her
arrow
through
this
man
heart
because
well
but
they
would
have
to
meet
if
he
were
not
to
be
lost
to
me
since
he
refused
to
be
a
partner
in
fibs
the
idea
seemed
exactly
the
chance
i
had
been
looking
for
and
if
the
invitation
came
through
me
provided
i
were
included
by
the
ambassadress
i
did
see
how
di
and
father
could
leave
me
out
all
right
you
shall
have
the
card
i
can
promise
that
my
captain
said
cheerily
but
i
haggled
will
the
ambassadress
ask
a
a
little
girl
like
me
who
is
out
yet
of
course
she
will
i
see
to
that
why
should
a
little
girl
go
for
once
here
is
one
partner
for
her
to
dance
in
the
white
dress
with
him
the
thing
must
be
too
good
to
be
true
yet
it
really
did
seem
as
if
it
might
come
true
he
let
me
select
the
place
for
luncheon
and
i
chose
the
zoo
he
said
i
could
have
chosen
better
it
was
a
very
grand
meal
but
it
was
the
happiest
i
ever
had
captain
march
told
me
things
about
america
and
aeroplanes
though
very
little
about
himself
except
that
he
was
stationed
at
a
beautiful
place
in
arizona
called
fort
alvarado
close
to
the
springs
of
the
same
name
where
girls
came
and
had
the
time
of
their
lives
afterward
we
wandered
about
and
made
love
to
the
zoo
animals
and
at
last
saw
them
fed
when
the
lions
and
tigers
had
finished
their
glorious
roaring
which
seemed
to
bring
the
desert
and
the
jungle
near
it
was
almost
five
so
we
had
tea
at
the
tea
house
in
front
of
the
mappin
terraces
i
lingered
over
my
strawberries
as
long
as
i
decently
could
because
though
i
searched
hard
for
it
there
seemed
to
be
no
bored
look
on
captain
march
face
when
i
did
reluctantly
say
i
suppose
i
better
go
home
he
actually
had
the
air
of
being
sorry
it
been
the
nicest
day
i
ever
lived
in
i
told
him
i
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
too
said
he
what
a
pity
we
polish
it
off
with
a
dinner
and
the
theatre
look
here
if
you
like
it
miss
peggy
i
guess
i
can
get
that
old
lady
i
told
you
of
sailing
and
will
take
the
lace
scarf
to
go
with
us
as
chaperon
what
do
you
say
what
could
i
say
being
a
child
it
did
matter
showing
the
wildest
delight
there
are
some
advantages
in
being
a
child
he
took
me
home
to
our
lodgings
in
chapel
street
which
cheaply
gave
us
the
address
of
mayfair
and
then
i
had
to
break
it
to
him
that
i
a
miss
good
gracious
he
exclaimed
when
i
began
with
those
words
children
do
marry
in
your
country
at
thirteen
do
they
i
explained
that
because
my
father
happened
to
be
an
earl
his
daughters
had
a
courtesy
title
and
when
he
looked
a
little
shocked
as
if
he
were
wondering
whether
he
had
been
indiscreet
i
nodded
toward
the
house
as
our
taxicab
stopped
before
the
insignificant
green
door
you
see
by
where
we
live
how
unimportant
we
are
i
excused
myself
in
such
a
pleading
voice
that
he
laughed
then
he
flashed
away
to
make
arrangements
for
the
evening
evening
the
landlady
had
a
telephone
and
presently
i
got
the
message
which
captain
march
had
told
me
to
expect
jewitt
had
consented
to
dine
and
go
to
the
theatre
would
i
like
the
savoy
and
to
see
milestones
afterward
and
was
i
sure
this
business
would
get
me
into
trouble
if
it
had
sent
me
into
penal
servitude
for
life
i
should
have
hesitated
but
i
replied
that
my
sister
would
forgive
me
for
the
sake
of
the
american
embassy
ball
i
knew
di
could
be
counted
on
in
the
exceptional
circumstances
not
to
tell
father
but
i
did
mention
that
detail
to
captain
march
i
was
afraid
he
might
think
the
stripe
had
been
but
one
must
draw
the
straight
line
of
truth
somewhere
chapter
iii
next
morning
when
di
came
back
i
told
her
what
was
necessary
to
tell
and
not
a
bit
more
i
explained
how
i
had
met
captain
eagleston
march
and
how
we
had
spent
the
day
and
the
heavenly
evening
but
first
i
let
her
open
the
invitation
which
had
just
come
by
hand
from
the
american
embassy
she
opens
all
father
letters
except
those
that
have
a
repulsively
private
look
and
when
she
began
i
wonder
how
on
earth
i
was
able
to
work
my
story
in
neatly
as
an
explanation
di
listened
to
the
end
without
interrupting
me
once
except
by
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
and
now
and
then
raising
her
eyebrows
or
giving
vent
to
expressive
sighs
i
saw
that
she
was
thinking
hard
as
i
went
on
and
i
knew
what
she
was
thinking
about
the
need
of
forgiving
me
because
of
the
new
interest
in
life
my
naughtiness
had
brought
her
when
i
had
finished
up
the
tale
with
our
dinner
at
the
savoy
and
seeing
milestones
and
then
on
top
of
all
having
supper
with
jewitt
and
captain
march
at
a
terribly
respectable
but
fascinating
night
club
of
which
he
had
been
made
a
member
diana
did
scold
she
said
that
captain
march
being
an
officer
and
a
flying
man
made
all
the
difference
but
she
hoped
i
would
not
have
put
myself
into
such
a
position
with
any
other
sort
of
man
whether
he
mistook
me
for
a
child
or
not
even
as
it
was
she
would
dare
tell
father
the
history
of
my
day
but
as
they
had
made
several
american
acquaintances
lately
she
could
easily
account
for
the
embassy
invitation
we
go
of
course
wo
we
i
catechized
her
knowing
that
her
word
with
father
was
pretty
well
law
yes
we
go
she
answered
i
write
an
acceptance
and
send
it
by
hand
i
was
so
enchanted
at
this
that
i
dashed
up
to
my
room
and
began
shortening
the
new
dress
i
had
mentioned
it
vaguely
to
di
but
it
was
the
one
part
of
my
story
in
which
she
took
no
interest
i
saw
how
the
keenness
died
out
of
her
beautiful
eyes
and
how
her
soul
retired
comfortably
behind
them
to
think
of
something
else
just
as
you
see
people
walk
away
from
windows
through
which
they
been
looking
out
leaving
them
emptily
blank
as
she
did
care
what
little
peggy
wore
little
peggy
decided
to
give
her
a
surprise
at
the
last
moment
nothing
much
was
said
about
the
embassy
ball
by
father
or
di
before
me
on
that
day
or
the
next
so
i
too
kept
my
own
counsel
i
was
afraid
if
i
gabbled
as
i
longed
to
do
father
might
take
it
into
his
head
that
the
child
had
better
stop
at
home
all
i
heard
was
a
little
talk
about
the
time
to
start
and
whether
a
taxi
should
be
ordered
or
a
coupé
i
thought
there
would
be
rather
a
squash
in
a
coupé
with
father
diana
and
me
folded
together
in
a
sort
of
living
sandwich
but
i
was
so
small
i
could
perhaps
manage
not
to
slide
off
the
little
flap
seat
with
its
back
to
the
horses
it
was
a
coupé
they
finally
decided
on
and
it
was
ordered
for
a
quarter
to
ten
we
had
a
short
and
early
dinner
and
as
i
did
diana
hair
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
never
seen
her
look
prettier
i
wondered
whether
captain
march
would
admire
her
very
much
and
i
hoped
for
his
own
sake
i
almost
believed
it
was
for
his
own
sake
that
he
would
fall
in
love
as
i
thought
this
i
looked
with
a
new
kind
of
criticism
at
di
to
judge
whether
he
were
likely
to
be
one
of
her
victims
heaps
of
men
had
fallen
in
love
with
di
since
i
began
to
be
old
enough
to
notice
such
things
they
had
never
been
the
right
sort
of
men
from
her
point
of
view
for
none
of
the
lot
had
had
a
penny
to
bless
himself
with
or
even
a
title
worth
the
taking
but
all
of
them
had
been
worth
flirting
with
and
after
they
had
been
dropped
with
more
or
less
of
a
dull
thud
i
afraid
some
of
them
had
suffered
i
did
wish
captain
march
to
suffer
yet
i
could
help
thinking
that
if
i
were
a
man
i
might
be
as
silly
as
the
rest
and
go
down
before
di
she
was
then
and
she
is
now
the
most
lovable
looking
thing
that
can
be
imagined
she
does
appear
to
be
cool
and
calculating
but
and
gentle
and
soft
far
more
so
than
most
of
the
girls
one
meets
especially
in
london
where
i
think
they
have
the
air
of
being
rather
hard
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
and
everybody
for
the
sake
of
what
they
want
to
get
or
do
if
you
were
going
to
paint
a
picture
of
ireland
typified
by
a
beautiful
girl
so
that
you
might
name
your
canvas
dark
rosaleen
you
would
give
the
world
to
get
di
for
your
model
she
is
tall
as
a
diana
ought
to
be
and
slender
though
not
thin
she
gives
the
effect
of
fashionable
slimness
yet
she
is
all
lovely
curves
and
roundnesses
she
has
a
long
white
throat
with
a
charming
upturned
chin
that
has
a
deep
cleft
in
the
middle
it
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
her
skin
is
as
white
as
creamy
milk
and
on
each
cheek
just
beneath
the
shadow
under
her
eyes
is
a
faint
pink
stain
as
if
it
had
been
tapped
hard
with
a
carnation
and
a
little
of
the
colour
had
come
off
perhaps
if
her
face
has
a
fault
the
nose
is
too
short
and
flat
but
it
gives
her
a
sweetly
young
and
innocent
look
added
to
her
eyes
being
set
far
apart
and
the
eyes
are
really
glorious
very
big
and
long
with
deep
shadows
under
them
only
partly
cast
by
her
thick
black
lashes
a
man
once
wrote
a
valentine
verse
to
di
in
which
he
remarked
that
her
eyes
were
like
sapphires
gleaming
blue
where
they
had
fallen
among
dark
grasses
and
it
was
a
bad
comparison
the
man
died
of
taking
too
much
veronal
a
year
after
nobody
said
he
had
done
it
on
purpose
but
i
wondered
he
was
very
unhappy
the
day
he
said
to
ballyconal
i
never
been
able
to
forget
his
look
di
mouth
is
large
and
a
tiny
bit
greedy
but
all
the
more
fascinating
for
that
because
it
is
so
red
and
curved
her
forehead
is
rather
high
really
but
she
makes
it
seem
only
a
white
line
above
her
level
eyebrows
because
of
the
way
she
likes
best
to
wear
her
crinkly
dark
hair
parted
in
the
middle
pushed
forward
and
down
and
banded
in
place
by
a
rope
of
hair
from
the
back
that
night
for
the
ball
at
the
american
embassy
she
had
it
fastened
with
big
very
green
jade
hairpins
from
her
little
pink
ears
hung
long
loops
of
emeralds
heirlooms
in
our
family
or
they
would
have
been
sold
long
ago
and
the
gown
she
chose
was
the
same
shade
of
green
some
very
thin
soft
stuff
with
one
of
those
new
names
dressmakers
think
of
in
their
dreams
it
was
simply
made
and
not
very
expensive
but
in
it
di
looked
like
a
classic
personification
of
ireland
at
its
loveliest
and
i
was
sure
that
not
the
girl
in
the
room
would
be
as
exquisite
as
she
i
told
her
this
on
an
impulse
and
she
was
pleased
yet
she
sighed
of
course
she
could
help
knowing
said
she
that
she
was
bad
looking
but
venus
or
helen
of
troy
could
make
a
success
handicapped
as
she
was
it
might
be
different
in
some
other
country
she
went
on
more
to
herself
than
to
me
a
country
like
america
where
titles
are
more
of
a
novelty
and
everybody
one
meets
does
remember
all
about
one
poor
mother
now
i
must
run
and
get
ready
myself
said
i
when
i
had
established
connection
between
diana
most
intricate
hooks
and
eyes
get
ready
for
what
dear
why
for
the
ball
of
course
the
first
chill
of
suspicion
that
i
had
been
cast
for
the
part
of
cinderella
crept
through
me
like
a
caterpillar
walking
inside
my
spine
but
my
di
exclaimed
you
could
have
thought
you
were
going
officially
you
are
a
little
girl
you
do
exist
and
if
you
did
you
have
a
dress
i
have
a
dress
the
one
i
bought
with
the
money
from
the
lace
i
say
much
because
i
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
surprise
you
well
i
awfully
sorry
dear
that
you
been
counting
on
it
i
never
dreamed
you
ought
to
have
told
me
you
said
you
accept
for
i
meant
father
and
me
it
never
crossed
my
mind
that
you
too
bad
but
anyhow
it
too
late
now
father
would
never
consent
i
might
have
retorted
that
she
was
the
one
person
in
the
world
who
could
make
him
consent
to
anything
she
wanted
but
then
the
truth
was
that
she
did
want
this
thing
diana
had
and
has
the
manners
of
an
angel
and
strangers
would
think
she
was
as
easy
to
melt
as
sugar
in
the
sun
but
i
who
have
lived
with
her
all
the
years
of
my
life
know
that
the
sugar
is
only
on
the
surface
and
i
have
learned
what
is
underneath
even
then
i
realized
that
di
had
understood
perfectly
well
from
the
first
that
i
expected
to
go
to
the
ball
and
she
had
kept
quiet
in
order
to
have
no
more
than
one
short
sharp
fuss
at
the
end
while
it
was
being
borne
in
upon
me
that
i
was
to
stop
at
home
instead
of
going
on
arguing
and
fishwifing
i
shut
up
like
a
clam
i
suppose
it
was
a
kind
of
obstinate
pride
the
sort
of
pride
that
makes
condemned
people
not
scream
or
throw
themselves
about
on
the
way
to
execution
but
when
father
and
di
had
gone
i
cried
oh
how
i
cried
there
was
a
kind
of
wild
pleasure
in
letting
the
sobs
come
and
feeling
the
hot
tears
spout
out
of
my
eyes
in
any
clash
between
us
di
always
won
because
she
was
grown
up
and
i
was
a
little
girl
but
the
trick
she
had
played
on
me
this
time
roused
my
sense
of
its
injustice
and
with
all
my
body
and
mind
and
soul
i
resolved
to
strengthen
my
soul
against
her
some
day
i
said
to
myself
letting
the
tears
dry
on
my
cheeks
as
i
listened
to
a
spirit
of
prophecy
some
day
there
be
a
battle
for
life
or
death
between
our
characters
di
and
mine
and
i
save
myself
up
to
win
it
seemed
weak
as
if
i
were
a
whipped
child
to
creep
off
to
bed
yet
i
could
force
myself
to
read
or
do
anything
to
turn
my
thoughts
from
the
great
injustice
at
ten
minutes
to
eleven
i
was
making
up
my
mind
that
after
all
sleep
would
be
the
best
consolation
when
our
landlady
knocked
we
had
the
floor
up
one
flight
of
stairs
from
the
street
luckily
i
was
still
in
the
a
fantastic
apartment
crowded
with
furniture
all
out
of
drawing
like
daddy
longlegs
when
the
woman
tapped
and
peeped
in
if
i
had
gone
upstairs
to
my
own
room
i
sure
being
a
prim
person
she
would
have
considered
it
improper
to
summon
me
down
and
i
should
have
missed
a
heavenly
half
hour
a
gentleman
has
called
miss
and
could
he
come
up
for
five
minutes
the
name
is
captain
march
it
was
true
it
was
he
and
he
had
even
met
diana
yet
she
had
been
dancing
but
the
hostess
had
introduced
him
to
father
and
captain
march
had
worked
round
to
the
subject
of
me
when
he
heard
that
i
was
too
young
for
balls
he
just
slipped
out
took
a
taxi
and
made
a
dash
to
chapel
street
to
tell
me
he
was
sorry
i
was
so
grateful
i
could
have
cried
more
than
ever
it
seemed
to
me
one
of
the
very
nicest
things
a
man
ever
did
he
was
in
uniform
because
an
american
officer
is
on
his
native
heath
when
he
at
his
own
embassy
and
i
thought
that
he
looked
adorable
in
uniform
he
stayed
half
an
hour
instead
of
five
minutes
and
then
said
he
must
go
back
and
do
the
right
thing
the
right
thing
which
he
particularly
want
to
do
was
to
dance
with
the
girls
who
were
booked
up
to
the
eyes
and
to
meet
my
sister
it
was
my
first
triumph
to
have
a
man
and
such
a
man
put
me
in
front
of
diana
i
was
thrilled
by
it
though
i
ought
to
have
had
sense
enough
to
know
what
would
happen
eagle
march
he
told
me
that
night
to
call
him
eagle
did
go
back
to
the
ball
and
did
meet
diana
i
heard
about
it
next
morning
when
i
took
in
her
breakfast
how
he
had
asked
father
if
he
might
be
introduced
and
di
had
liked
him
so
much
that
she
found
a
dance
to
give
him
although
everything
was
engaged
by
the
time
he
arrived
how
an
american
girl
who
knew
him
at
home
said
that
he
had
a
rich
aunt
who
might
leave
him
a
whole
heap
of
money
some
day
the
aunt
of
the
lace
i
said
to
myself
and
how
father
had
consented
to
take
diana
and
me
to
hendon
to
see
captain
march
monoplane
in
its
hangar
i
managed
that
for
you
dear
to
make
up
for
your
disappointment
last
night
and
because
you
really
a
good
useful
little
flap
of
a
flapper
di
finished
once
we
at
hendon
i
sure
father
can
be
coaxed
to
let
us
go
up
for
just
a
short
flight
though
he
thinks
now
that
nothing
could
induce
him
to
captain
march
has
promised
that
i
shall
be
his
first
woman
passenger
never
has
he
taken
a
woman
with
him
yet
i
only
gasped
inaudibly
and
bit
a
little
piece
off
my
heart
of
course
i
guessed
then
what
must
have
happened
and
when
eagle
came
that
afternoon
i
i
was
for
him
a
nice
child
still
a
good
useful
little
flapper
as
di
said
and
he
was
my
friend
as
before
but
diana
had
lit
up
the
world
for
him
he
could
hardly
take
his
eyes
off
her
when
she
spoke
even
at
a
distance
he
heard
every
word
and
nothing
that
any
one
else
said
why
did
you
tell
me
your
sister
was
such
a
wonderful
beauty
he
mumbled
as
he
was
saying
old
people
and
even
people
over
must
have
forgotten
how
it
can
hurt
when
you
are
sixteen
to
be
in
love
with
some
one
who
loves
somebody
else
for
neither
in
books
nor
in
real
life
do
these
persons
ever
take
such
a
thing
seriously
but
i
shall
never
cease
to
remember
how
it
feels
like
having
to
keep
smiling
while
a
bullet
is
probed
for
in
your
heart
not
probed
for
only
once
and
finished
for
good
but
prodded
and
poked
at
every
minute
of
every
hour
day
after
day
week
after
week
month
after
month
how
can
you
tell
whether
or
no
it
going
to
be
year
after
year
as
well
till
all
the
red
blood
of
your
youth
and
hope
has
slowly
been
drained
away
chapter
iv
neither
diana
nor
i
had
ever
been
at
hendon
captain
march
sent
a
motor
car
for
us
and
i
saw
father
and
di
were
both
impressed
by
this
they
thought
he
must
have
money
as
all
proper
americans
have
according
to
their
idea
apart
from
his
future
expectations
what
thought
was
that
having
fallen
in
love
with
di
nothing
but
a
motor
car
could
be
good
enough
for
a
goddess
and
hang
the
expense
di
who
was
invited
sometimes
for
a
spin
in
friends
automobiles
had
a
fetching
motor
which
eked
out
with
one
of
those
horrific
headpieces
flying
people
wear
could
be
used
for
a
short
flight
i
had
nothing
of
the
sort
but
di
offered
to
lend
me
her
lined
coat
after
all
she
owed
the
expedition
and
the
airman
to
me
it
was
a
hired
car
but
in
father
opinion
a
dashed
decent
one
it
flashed
us
out
past
the
marble
arch
straight
along
the
edgware
road
to
the
flying
ground
which
even
two
years
ago
was
the
favourite
resort
of
fashion
especially
female
fashion
i
had
often
wondered
what
it
might
be
like
out
there
and
was
rather
disappointed
to
see
only
some
large
flat
fields
close
to
the
highroad
with
a
long
line
of
low
uninteresting
sheds
ranged
side
by
side
it
did
seem
as
if
airmen
who
must
be
brimming
like
full
cups
with
wine
of
romance
and
imagination
ought
to
have
invented
sightlier
houses
for
their
beloved
machines
but
the
very
thought
that
the
ugly
huts
were
hangars
gave
a
thrill
captain
march
was
to
meet
us
at
hendon
but
we
did
see
him
at
first
as
we
arrived
an
aeroplane
went
up
and
a
monoplane
was
circling
the
enclosure
giving
sudden
dips
at
fearfully
steep
angles
as
it
took
the
turns
righting
itself
like
a
lazy
eagle
with
wings
as
it
came
again
into
the
straight
captain
march
hired
chauffeur
who
had
been
told
exactly
what
to
do
ran
the
car
up
a
short
road
on
the
right
and
stopped
that
the
captain
hangar
my
lord
said
he
to
father
pointing
to
a
shed
near
which
we
had
halted
and
his
arm
had
time
to
drop
before
the
bird
which
had
been
circling
round
planed
down
and
glided
in
at
the
door
like
a
homing
pigeon
into
a
pigeon
house
it
was
beautifully
managed
and
so
dramatic
that
it
was
like
the
climax
of
an
act
on
the
stage
perhaps
captain
march
had
been
performing
some
feat
before
we
came
anyhow
as
he
brought
his
monoplane
to
rest
a
lot
of
people
standing
about
applauded
him
in
a
minute
he
came
almost
running
out
of
the
shed
straight
toward
us
in
his
leather
clothes
and
leather
helmet
with
goggles
pushed
up
to
the
top
of
his
head
instead
of
being
proud
of
what
he
had
done
whatever
it
was
he
apologized
abjectly
for
being
late
and
i
could
see
that
di
was
vain
of
her
conquest
lots
of
women
were
there
staring
enviously
at
the
pretty
girl
who
knew
a
real
live
airman
evidently
too
one
of
the
popular
ones
and
di
loves
to
be
envied
i
afraid
we
all
do
in
the
secret
places
of
our
hearts
which
we
do
like
to
peer
into
under
the
dust
one
thing
about
di
which
makes
men
adore
her
is
that
she
contrives
to
seem
exquisitely
sympathetic
and
enthusiastic
without
ever
gushing
partly
the
shape
of
her
eyes
and
the
shortness
of
her
upper
lip
which
combine
together
to
give
a
lovely
rapt
brooding
expression
that
saves
her
the
trouble
of
thinking
up
adjectives
with
this
look
on
she
appeals
to
all
the
love
of
romance
and
adventure
in
their
hearts
sure
they
would
do
anything
to
win
it
for
themselves
i
would
myself
if
i
were
a
man
and
did
know
her
so
when
captain
march
took
us
into
his
hangar
and
she
turned
on
the
look
i
did
blame
him
for
forgetting
the
very
existence
of
his
small
pal
it
only
made
me
sad
i
thought
i
better
take
the
up
for
a
short
run
and
test
her
before
you
came
to
see
that
she
was
all
right
he
was
still
apologizing
then
she
behaved
so
well
i
got
going
and
stayed
up
longer
than
i
meant
but
i
saw
the
car
stop
so
i
hurried
down
i
should
think
you
did
down
laughed
diana
the
way
you
aimed
at
your
hangar
from
far
up
in
the
sky
and
shot
in
was
like
a
marksman
aiming
at
the
on
a
target
and
getting
it
what
do
you
call
your
monoplane
what
had
you
been
doing
to
make
all
those
people
applaud
oh
only
a
little
flying
said
captain
march
as
he
might
have
said
only
a
little
breathing
exercise
you
see
i
make
stability
tests
that
what
i
and
with
my
appliances
being
upside
down
no
more
to
me
than
it
is
to
a
fly
when
he
walks
on
the
ceiling
di
eyes
said
you
hero
you
splendid
modest
hero
said
it
so
plainly
that
the
hero
faintly
blushed
though
it
was
hard
to
trace
a
blush
on
his
face
burnt
by
sun
and
wind
my
eyes
said
nothing
at
all
but
if
they
had
recited
a
whole
page
of
shakespeare
sonnets
he
would
have
been
none
the
wiser
he
led
us
into
the
hangar
where
two
fascinatingly
smudged
mechanics
were
in
attendance
on
the
magic
bird
and
he
remembered
to
be
nice
and
respectful
to
father
explanations
of
the
mechanism
were
ostensibly
addressed
to
our
parent
but
in
reality
all
the
eloquence
was
for
di
whose
eyes
poured
forth
appreciative
intelligence
as
stars
pour
forth
rays
captain
march
could
be
expected
to
know
poor
fellow
that
di
if
obliged
to
choose
between
two
deadly
dull
evils
would
rather
hear
a
cook
tell
how
to
boil
potatoes
than
listen
to
any
mechanical
talk
however
it
was
really
needful
to
listen
if
one
eyes
were
well
trained
and
di
was
having
the
time
of
her
life
in
meeting
an
airman
even
i
could
see
that
this
monoplane
fitted
with
captain
inventions
was
a
different
looking
creature
from
the
other
bird
machines
which
were
shooting
up
into
the
air
or
darting
back
into
their
dens
all
around
us
the
quiet
graceful
wings
instead
of
being
in
a
straight
line
with
each
other
were
set
at
an
obtuse
angle
one
from
another
and
on
the
end
of
each
were
odd
little
extra
triangular
tips
hinged
to
the
main
wings
i
longed
to
pour
out
questions
for
the
why
of
things
especially
mechanical
things
has
interested
me
ever
since
i
was
old
enough
to
pick
a
doll
to
pieces
to
see
what
made
its
eyes
open
and
shut
but
di
was
asking
idiotic
questions
in
the
sweetest
way
and
captain
march
was
laughing
and
delighted
it
pleased
him
a
great
deal
more
that
she
should
want
to
know
precisely
why
he
had
named
his
monoplane
the
than
if
father
or
i
had
catechized
him
with
the
trained
intelligence
of
a
scientist
i
been
unoriginal
enough
i
afraid
to
name
my
big
baby
after
myself
he
said
my
nickname
being
eagle
the
golden
eagle
you
know
is
our
national
bird
so
her
hangar
is
eagle
nest
said
di
that
awfully
nice
but
why
not
name
her
instead
the
would
it
be
rather
conceited
not
after
what
she
already
done
and
shown
that
she
can
do
conceited
of
me
to
suggest
it
though
for
for
the
is
a
sort
of
a
nickname
of
since
a
fancy
dress
ball
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
it
suits
you
exactly
said
captain
march
if
lord
ballyconal
will
let
you
be
my
first
lady
passenger
and
if
after
she
given
you
a
run
you
think
her
worthy
she
shall
be
renamed
the
provided
you
baptize
her
oh
bally
dear
you
will
let
me
go
wo
you
di
pleaded
using
her
pet
name
for
father
which
he
likes
because
it
sounds
young
and
unparental
then
catching
a
bleak
gleam
in
my
eyes
she
hastily
added
and
afterward
peggy
if
captain
march
will
take
her
up
father
hesitated
but
the
newspapers
and
people
at
the
embassy
ball
who
knew
all
about
eagle
march
had
spoken
so
highly
of
the
machine
that
it
seemed
an
insult
to
a
famous
airman
skill
to
refuse
the
two
mechanics
wheeled
the
monoplane
out
of
the
shed
and
captain
march
explained
how
easy
and
safe
he
could
make
things
for
a
passenger
lots
of
men
had
been
up
with
him
but
he
had
never
asked
a
woman
only
a
short
flight
take
her
he
almost
pleaded
i
can
give
her
a
helmet
perhaps
rather
go
first
yourself
though
and
see
what
it
like
father
may
not
have
had
a
particularly
good
time
on
earth
but
anyhow
he
preferred
it
to
atmospheric
effects
he
said
that
he
had
no
head
for
heights
but
if
di
and
peggy
wanted
to
go
and
captain
march
was
kind
enough
to
take
them
er
up
a
tiny
way
into
the
er
air
he
supposed
that
in
these
days
he
ought
not
to
offer
any
objections
captain
march
had
the
spare
helmet
ready
it
looked
so
new
and
smart
i
felt
sure
he
had
bought
it
for
the
occasion
and
nothing
stood
between
diana
the
huntress
and
her
quarry
nothing
except
her
own
changing
mood
i
think
it
was
the
look
of
the
helmet
which
gave
her
that
sinking
feeling
of
irrevocability
which
seems
to
sever
you
as
with
a
sword
from
all
the
dear
little
safe
things
that
have
made
up
your
life
in
the
past
she
glanced
from
the
helmet
which
the
airman
held
toward
her
to
the
monoplane
on
the
ground
i
saw
her
big
eyes
dilate
as
they
fixed
themselves
anxiously
on
the
passenger
perch
to
which
the
honoured
guest
must
climb
above
the
conductor
seat
crawling
through
the
wire
stays
or
whatever
you
call
them
which
were
like
a
web
inviting
a
fly
diana
turned
pale
even
her
lips
were
white
the
shadows
under
her
eyes
darkened
as
if
she
were
you
you
sure
it
safe
she
faltered
safe
as
a
house
safer
than
a
house
captain
march
assured
her
cheeringly
look
at
these
and
he
pointed
out
again
all
the
features
of
his
invention
that
made
the
automatic
stability
of
the
machine
but
if
you
oh
i
not
afraid
quavered
di
her
eyes
roving
in
an
agonized
way
over
the
crowd
collecting
to
see
the
lovely
girl
taken
up
into
the
sky
by
the
brave
airman
it
is
that
only
it
wo
make
me
seasick
will
it
i
never
had
a
passenger
seasick
said
eagle
and
you
wo
turn
upside
down
will
you
of
course
not
well
then
i
i
go
on
with
the
condemned
cap
i
mean
the
leather
helmet
diana
paling
beauty
was
blotted
out
wrapped
in
her
cloak
she
was
trembling
all
over
her
hands
which
she
held
confidingly
out
for
the
thick
mittens
captain
march
had
got
for
her
shook
like
the
last
leaves
on
a
frozen
tree
think
you
fit
for
it
di
father
asked
anxiously
yes
indeed
came
hissing
through
the
helmet
but
i
felt
it
was
only
the
tonic
of
other
women
envy
which
was
keeping
her
up
i
was
envying
her
too
captain
march
helped
di
scramble
into
her
perch
his
hand
was
steady
and
strong
all
his
life
and
skill
and
manhood
were
for
her
she
was
tenderly
yet
firmly
strapped
into
place
and
told
how
she
was
to
hold
on
and
not
to
be
afraid
there
would
be
some
noise
but
she
mind
and
there
was
the
little
apparatus
captain
march
had
invented
by
which
a
passenger
could
communicate
with
the
conductor
it
was
something
like
the
bulb
you
squeeze
in
a
motor
car
when
you
want
the
chauffeur
to
turn
right
or
left
or
stop
press
once
if
you
sick
of
it
and
want
to
come
down
said
eagle
twice
if
you
want
to
go
higher
there
a
whistle
close
to
my
ear
so
sharp
it
cuts
through
the
motor
noise
my
heart
beat
almost
as
fast
as
if
i
were
in
the
monoplane
myself
when
eagle
was
ready
to
start
looking
like
a
apollo
starting
out
to
drive
his
sun
chariot
up
to
the
zenith
and
down
the
other
side
the
motor
purred
and
the
propeller
began
to
revolve
diana
tense
as
a
stretched
violin
string
was
hanging
on
already
like
grim
death
the
two
mechanics
held
the
tail
of
the
impatient
giant
bird
and
when
eagle
raised
one
hand
they
let
go
for
perhaps
fifty
yards
the
ran
lightly
over
the
turf
on
her
bicycle
wheels
then
her
master
tilted
the
planes
and
his
namesake
soared
upward
from
the
ground
into
the
air
as
she
went
through
the
noise
she
made
i
heard
a
shriek
from
the
passenger
diana
pride
which
denied
cowardice
in
the
joy
of
being
envied
was
forgotten
in
the
primitive
emotion
of
fear
what
my
sister
did
i
could
not
see
as
the
monoplane
mounted
so
quickly
but
almost
at
once
i
realized
that
she
must
have
signalled
her
wish
to
descend
for
the
ceased
to
soar
dropped
and
began
gently
gliding
down
a
moment
later
the
great
winged
form
was
landing
once
more
close
to
its
own
shed
father
rushed
to
the
rescue
of
his
darling
and
captain
march
out
of
his
seat
in
a
second
was
unfastening
the
straps
and
anxiously
extricating
diana
from
the
passenger
perch
i
could
help
feeling
ashamed
before
all
the
people
scornful
or
sympathetic
who
were
looking
on
that
my
sister
had
shown
herself
a
coward
but
i
was
sorry
for
her
too
she
had
quite
collapsed
and
lay
in
father
arms
as
captain
march
unfastened
her
helmet
i
was
mean
enough
to
think
of
rejoicing
because
in
taking
my
place
away
she
had
been
tried
and
found
wanting
instead
i
found
myself
really
afraid
that
captain
march
might
despise
the
poor
girl
for
the
timidity
which
humiliated
him
as
well
as
her
but
i
need
not
have
worried
pulling
off
the
helmet
in
that
clumsy
way
a
man
has
with
any
sort
of
headgear
the
wheel
of
braided
hair
diana
wore
wound
over
each
ear
in
the
eastern
fashion
that
came
from
kismet
was
loosened
and
a
thick
plait
with
an
engaging
wave
at
the
end
fell
down
on
either
side
of
her
face
standing
but
supported
in
father
arms
her
head
lay
on
his
shoulder
her
eyes
closed
long
curling
lashes
resting
on
marble
cheeks
i
had
never
seen
her
half
so
beautiful
and
captain
march
gazed
at
her
as
if
he
would
gladly
give
his
life
for
a
reassuring
smile
shall
i
fetch
a
doctor
he
asked
miserably
there
sure
to
be
one
somewhere
around
before
father
could
answer
di
opened
her
eyes
and
captain
march
got
the
smile
without
paying
the
price
i
i
all
right
she
breathed
so
sorry
i
was
afraid
you
know
it
was
my
it
seemed
to
stop
of
course
you
were
afraid
eagle
encouraged
her
i
can
never
forgive
myself
for
making
you
suffer
diana
smile
graciously
forgave
the
brutal
fellow
for
his
blundering
and
she
extricated
herself
from
father
arms
the
colour
slowly
stealing
back
to
her
lips
and
cheeks
she
shook
her
head
a
little
and
the
two
braids
stuck
full
of
tiny
hairpins
tumbled
over
her
breast
captain
march
nearly
ate
her
up
with
his
eyes
and
then
through
their
windows
his
soul
might
be
seen
worshipping
and
begging
the
goddess
pardon
on
its
knees
she
not
strong
father
apologized
it
my
fault
for
letting
her
go
up
i
ought
to
have
remembered
her
heart
it
a
great
asset
a
weak
heart
for
a
person
who
has
just
made
an
exhibition
of
cowardice
like
charity
it
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
i
never
before
heard
of
di
heart
being
weak
and
at
home
if
there
were
a
ball
anywhere
within
twenty
miles
she
could
always
dance
at
it
till
morning
however
i
was
glad
she
thought
of
her
heart
in
time
and
saved
the
situation
it
was
an
accommodating
heart
for
it
came
up
smiling
when
the
petting
di
got
had
satisfied
her
that
she
was
to
be
blamed
for
the
fiasco
i
think
flying
must
be
a
wonderful
experience
for
any
one
whose
heart
is
quite
right
she
consoled
captain
march
it
a
pity
for
the
credit
of
the
family
you
did
take
peggy
up
first
i
suppose
she
wo
feel
like
going
after
what
has
happened
to
you
said
he
remembering
my
existence
oh
i
do
feel
like
it
more
than
ever
i
exclaimed
that
is
if
you
do
mind
risking
another
of
us
i
do
think
we
better
trouble
captain
march
again
father
cut
in
he
would
like
a
second
failure
he
wo
have
one
i
said
my
heart
is
as
strong
as
a
gnome
motor
do
let
me
go
it
will
give
di
time
to
rest
whether
that
argument
decided
father
or
whether
he
really
did
hope
i
might
reestablish
the
family
credit
for
courage
i
do
know
anyway
he
made
no
further
objections
the
cloak
helmet
and
mittens
were
handed
over
to
me
i
crawled
through
the
spider
web
to
the
tiny
throne
vacated
by
its
late
queen
and
was
strapped
in
as
di
had
been
not
one
qualm
did
i
feel
as
i
looked
down
over
eagle
shoulder
at
the
various
instruments
fixed
on
to
what
in
an
aeroplane
corresponds
i
suppose
to
the
dashboard
of
an
automobile
the
revolution
gauge
which
eagle
had
explained
to
us
the
watch
the
map
to
roll
up
on
a
frame
like
a
blind
the
compass
the
height
indicator
i
felt
secure
and
happy
in
the
thought
that
my
courage
would
at
least
make
my
captain
respect
me
he
had
shown
us
how
his
invention
enabled
the
monoplane
to
balance
itself
in
meeting
every
gust
of
wind
or
falling
into
an
air
pocket
without
any
effort
from
the
conductor
that
assurance
had
been
enough
for
di
winged
victory
goddess
and
huntress
but
it
was
enough
for
humble
peggy
besides
in
the
mood
which
had
swept
over
me
like
a
blinding
flame
of
white
fire
i
did
care
what
happened
provided
it
happened
to
eagle
march
and
me
together
i
should
have
liked
him
to
aim
straight
for
the
sun
and
never
to
come
down
again
the
last
thing
i
said
before
we
started
was
go
as
high
please
as
you
would
if
you
were
alone
if
i
press
the
bulb
it
will
be
twice
to
fly
higher
then
came
the
starting
of
the
motor
the
wheeled
run
and
the
leap
into
air
as
we
took
wing
i
could
have
sung
for
joy
i
was
so
gloriously
excited
i
was
hardly
conscious
of
the
noise
of
the
engine
that
helmeted
head
and
the
firm
shoulders
beneath
me
seemed
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
god
we
circled
over
the
enclosure
the
had
risen
very
high
yet
but
i
had
a
queer
feeling
of
being
no
longer
related
to
any
one
on
earth
i
was
with
my
champion
a
creature
of
another
sphere
intoxicated
with
joy
i
pressed
the
bulb
twice
i
could
not
hear
the
shrill
whistle
but
the
driver
evidently
heard
for
in
obedience
we
shot
up
up
up
the
height
indicator
showed
that
we
had
reached
the
height
of
five
hundred
feet
i
pressed
the
bulb
again
twice
over
eagle
began
to
steer
the
monoplane
in
immense
circles
i
felt
i
could
almost
see
our
in
the
air
like
twisted
threads
of
gold
on
blue
the
hangars
in
the
fields
of
hendon
were
toy
sheds
on
a
tray
even
the
aerodrome
was
no
more
than
a
big
rat
trap
london
spread
itself
out
beneath
us
a
vast
dark
patch
like
a
fallen
cloud
a
shaft
of
sunlight
set
a
golden
dome
on
fire
it
must
have
been
paul
for
the
third
time
i
gave
the
signal
to
mount
for
the
third
time
eagle
obeyed
i
wondered
if
he
liked
me
a
little
for
sharing
the
confidence
he
had
in
his
machine
a
few
white
clouds
floated
lazily
beneath
us
like
snowy
birds
of
an
intolerable
brightness
and
titanic
size
then
they
joined
together
in
a
glittering
flock
and
lost
the
semblance
of
birds
the
mass
became
a
sparkling
silver
sea
with
here
and
there
a
dark
gulf
in
it
like
a
whirlpool
the
air
grew
biting
cold
i
felt
it
press
on
me
through
the
coat
di
had
lent
like
blocks
of
solid
ice
but
the
strange
sensation
only
exhilarated
me
the
more
i
not
a
coward
i
not
a
coward
i
brave
the
words
sang
themselves
in
my
head
to
the
accompanying
roar
of
the
motor
it
was
a
glorious
dependable
roar
but
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
a
spiral
movement
i
noticed
a
change
in
the
sound
a
gurgle
a
choking
stammer
a
spray
of
petrol
dashed
across
my
goggles
now
what
the
question
asked
itself
in
my
soul
but
there
was
no
fear
with
it
only
an
awed
realization
that
this
might
be
the
end
of
things
as
i
had
known
them
in
a
very
little
world
low
down
and
far
away
what
does
it
matter
the
answer
came
but
eagle
had
turned
round
in
his
seat
and
was
handing
me
a
spanner
now
he
was
motioning
to
me
if
he
spoke
i
could
hear
a
word
yet
i
understood
from
the
gestures
of
one
mittened
hand
what
he
hoped
i
might
be
able
to
do
somehow
even
then
the
driving
force
of
thought
in
my
brain
was
to
please
him
to
show
him
that
he
had
relied
on
me
in
vain
rather
than
to
save
us
both
from
threatening
danger
though
danger
i
saw
there
must
be
i
was
determined
that
the
corporal
should
not
fail
the
captain
the
thing
i
had
to
do
as
i
seized
the
situation
was
to
turn
the
spanner
on
a
loosened
nut
in
the
petrol
pipe
to
which
eagle
pointed
reaching
up
with
my
right
hand
i
steadied
myself
with
the
left
and
touched
something
hot
horribly
hot
there
was
an
involuntary
flinch
of
the
nerves
as
the
heat
burned
through
the
thick
mittens
i
wore
and
scorched
my
fingers
but
i
did
scream
i
glad
to
say
or
let
go
the
spanner
i
screwed
and
screwed
at
the
union
with
the
nasty
smell
of
burnt
wool
and
perhaps
flesh
in
my
nostrils
then
there
came
the
glorious
sensation
of
success
as
the
song
of
the
motor
took
up
its
old
refrain
again
no
more
choking
and
spluttering
and
it
was
i
who
had
cured
it
i
gave
a
little
sob
of
thanksgiving
because
i
had
failed
and
a
voice
seemed
to
whisper
far
far
down
under
the
renewed
song
of
the
engine
what
if
this
is
a
prophecy
what
if
after
diana
has
left
him
in
the
lurch
it
should
be
given
to
to
atone
to
help
or
save
him
in
some
danger
the
little
voice
was
so
strong
so
clear
that
i
thrilled
all
over
what
it
said
seemed
to
become
part
of
an
experience
which
i
could
never
forget
chapter
v
in
the
remaining
six
weeks
of
his
leave
eagle
march
made
himself
very
popular
in
england
he
secured
a
record
for
altitude
and
flew
upside
down
longer
than
any
one
else
had
at
that
time
two
years
ago
which
is
a
whole
age
in
the
aeroplane
world
he
did
other
quaint
tricks
too
that
nobody
had
thought
of
or
accomplished
then
such
as
walking
on
a
wing
of
the
monoplane
when
she
was
in
the
air
and
all
the
prettiest
and
smartest
women
in
london
were
proud
to
meet
him
he
was
invited
everywhere
and
people
who
pretended
to
know
said
that
peeresses
married
and
unmarried
made
violent
love
to
captain
march
naturally
a
girl
like
di
was
enchanted
to
lead
him
about
tied
to
what
would
have
been
her
apron
strings
if
she
been
frumpish
enough
to
wear
such
things
when
it
began
to
be
said
that
eagle
march
found
excuses
not
to
accept
invitations
unless
lord
ballyconal
and
lady
di
might
be
expected
to
turn
up
father
and
diana
were
asked
by
a
great
many
hostesses
who
would
have
thought
of
them
except
as
bait
di
realized
this
even
if
father
were
too
proud
or
too
conceited
to
do
so
and
she
used
eagle
in
every
way
for
all
he
was
worth
she
liked
him
too
better
than
she
ever
liked
any
man
perhaps
except
her
first
love
the
handsomest
irish
boy
you
ever
saw
whom
she
could
think
of
marrying
because
he
no
family
and
no
money
but
she
was
only
seventeen
then
and
jerry
taylor
was
a
mere
subaltern
he
died
in
india
of
enteric
when
di
was
eighteen
and
before
captain
march
came
on
the
scene
she
had
liked
and
flirted
with
at
least
a
dozen
others
besides
eagle
march
was
a
very
different
proposition
as
they
say
in
his
country
from
poor
jerry
taylor
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
think
of
marrying
him
if
he
wanted
her
and
he
did
want
her
desperately
a
moderately
intelligent
bat
could
have
seen
that
he
was
dying
for
my
lovely
sister
anyhow
saw
it
and
i
saw
that
she
saw
it
and
that
she
was
troubled
as
to
which
way
to
make
up
her
mind
she
did
want
to
lose
her
golden
eagle
with
his
brilliant
plumage
of
fame
and
popularity
and
the
future
fortune
from
his
aunt
on
the
other
hand
through
eagle
di
had
met
a
number
of
desirable
men
some
moneyed
some
titled
and
she
was
a
girl
who
would
rather
marry
a
rich
nobody
of
the
country
she
had
known
than
fly
with
a
hero
to
a
land
she
knew
not
i
used
to
notice
in
her
soft
thoughtful
eyes
the
wait
and
see
policy
as
the
time
drew
near
for
eagle
to
go
back
to
his
regiment
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
things
grew
exciting
i
felt
electricity
in
the
atmosphere
though
diana
did
confide
in
me
and
i
had
no
idea
what
she
meant
to
do
i
could
bear
to
think
of
eagle
having
to
suffer
as
he
must
suffer
if
she
threw
him
over
for
already
i
knew
enough
of
him
to
know
that
quiet
as
he
was
he
had
very
deep
and
sensitive
feelings
i
am
too
young
even
now
after
all
i
have
lived
through
in
the
last
year
or
two
to
set
myself
up
as
a
judge
of
character
yet
i
then
help
forming
my
own
opinion
of
all
those
who
came
near
me
i
seemed
to
see
under
eagle
march
simple
calmly
deliberate
manner
flashes
of
inner
fire
i
thought
his
character
was
not
really
simple
at
all
but
very
complex
i
do
mean
in
a
deceitful
way
far
indeed
from
that
but
i
believed
there
was
much
in
him
which
he
did
not
yet
know
himself
about
himself
i
fancied
that
the
southern
blood
he
had
in
his
veins
from
one
side
of
his
family
had
made
him
and
passionate
as
well
as
daring
quick
to
think
and
quick
to
act
and
that
his
study
was
to
hold
this
side
of
his
nature
in
check
i
felt
sure
that
he
was
generous
even
to
a
fault
yet
i
was
certain
that
if
driven
to
desperation
there
might
be
a
cruel
streak
which
would
make
him
a
dangerous
enemy
unless
some
tide
of
love
broke
down
the
barrier
of
hardness
in
his
soul
he
was
not
hard
at
that
time
however
and
i
did
want
my
sister
to
be
the
one
to
make
him
so
for
this
reason
i
sometimes
wished
that
she
would
marry
him
and
give
him
as
much
happiness
as
she
had
it
in
her
to
give
and
yet
apart
from
my
own
feelings
they
did
count
for
his
losing
di
would
not
give
him
to
me
i
could
believe
that
having
her
would
really
be
for
his
happiness
in
the
end
the
two
had
one
idea
or
taste
in
common
but
all
i
could
do
was
to
hope
that
whatever
happened
it
would
be
for
best
because
you
see
knowing
him
and
having
that
chevron
of
black
and
gold
as
a
reward
of
valour
had
made
me
a
nicer
less
selfish
girl
than
i
had
been
before
we
met
because
i
loved
a
soldier
i
wanted
to
be
a
soldier
too
hardly
anything
of
the
pert
minx
remained
in
me
i
used
to
think
sometimes
and
comparatively
little
of
the
pig
or
cat
this
was
fortunate
because
when
toward
the
last
he
confided
in
me
everything
bad
that
was
left
in
my
composition
longed
to
turn
and
rend
diana
the
way
he
did
this
made
it
all
the
harder
for
me
not
to
desert
the
colours
he
told
me
that
ever
since
the
day
when
i
had
been
such
a
little
trump
in
the
air
and
maybe
saved
both
our
lives
i
been
more
to
him
than
any
other
female
thing
except
of
course
my
sister
something
in
diana
weakness
had
appealed
to
him
as
much
as
my
strength
and
he
loved
her
with
a
different
love
from
the
affection
he
gave
me
i
was
his
little
sister
his
brave
little
friend
and
because
i
was
so
dear
to
him
he
dared
to
ask
me
what
chance
he
had
with
diana
did
i
think
she
tried
to
keep
him
from
telling
her
what
he
felt
because
she
did
care
and
wanted
to
save
him
pain
or
was
there
just
a
possibility
that
she
was
only
shy
i
could
have
given
a
bitter
laugh
to
both
questions
because
the
truthful
answer
to
one
and
the
other
was
the
same
no
di
loved
to
get
proposals
and
counted
them
up
as
if
they
were
scalps
or
those
horrid
little
soft
boneless
masks
which
head
hunters
collect
the
only
trouble
was
that
among
the
lot
she
had
never
had
one
scalp
worth
the
wearing
for
a
real
live
beauty
who
needed
only
a
bit
of
luck
to
be
at
the
top
of
the
world
as
for
her
shyness
it
was
all
in
the
tricks
she
played
with
her
eyelashes
and
the
way
she
curved
her
upper
lip
but
i
did
laugh
i
merely
said
i
was
sure
how
diana
felt
as
she
never
talked
to
me
about
such
things
and
i
got
for
answer
spoken
reflectively
i
suppose
not
you
too
much
of
a
child
he
knew
by
this
time
that
i
was
sixteen
instead
of
thirteen
as
he
had
thought
at
first
but
what
you
not
much
interested
in
makes
little
impression
on
your
mind
if
you
a
man
and
in
love
for
him
i
was
a
child
a
nice
sympathetic
child
and
such
affection
as
he
gave
me
i
lived
upon
as
if
it
had
been
the
washings
from
a
cup
of
the
elixir
of
life
for
his
sake
i
studied
di
more
closely
than
ever
after
that
day
and
soon
i
understood
what
she
was
driving
at
she
wanted
to
have
her
cake
and
eat
it
too
and
she
got
it
any
girl
can
manage
this
if
she
is
clever
enough
and
di
though
she
is
bookish
or
intellectual
is
very
very
clever
in
the
way
women
have
been
clever
since
they
emerged
from
cave
life
she
succeeded
in
keeping
back
a
real
proposal
which
she
would
have
had
to
answer
with
a
yes
or
no
but
she
hinted
to
captain
march
that
if
she
could
have
just
a
little
more
time
to
think
about
it
with
the
glamour
of
his
presence
gone
she
would
probably
realize
that
she
could
be
happy
without
him
of
course
it
would
be
a
blow
for
poor
dear
bally
if
she
married
out
of
ireland
or
england
but
still
but
still
only
give
her
time
to
read
her
heart
eagle
told
me
something
of
the
scene
between
them
and
of
course
i
saw
exactly
what
di
was
up
to
but
i
caged
all
the
wild
cats
in
me
and
said
i
was
glad
if
were
happy
yes
indeed
i
take
care
of
di
for
him
and
write
him
how
she
looked
and
what
she
did
and
use
all
my
influence
to
make
father
escort
us
both
over
to
america
as
soon
as
possible
di
it
seemed
had
also
agreed
to
use
her
influence
in
bringing
this
result
about
i
could
tell
at
the
time
whether
she
had
thrown
the
promise
as
a
sop
to
keep
eagle
quiet
or
whether
she
really
thought
that
she
would
like
to
go
all
i
knew
was
that
if
she
did
use
her
influence
and
father
could
get
hold
of
enough
money
the
thing
was
as
good
as
done
eagle
took
his
departure
and
we
and
lots
of
his
new
friends
went
to
euston
to
see
him
off
for
liverpool
di
no
doubt
secretly
thinking
that
sort
of
public
safer
than
a
private
one
as
for
our
going
to
america
the
scheme
hung
by
a
thread
as
i
guessed
soon
after
eagle
back
was
turned
a
bird
in
the
hand
is
always
worth
at
least
two
in
the
bush
and
di
hand
was
ready
if
the
right
bird
could
be
palmed
before
the
season
end
it
would
mean
that
nothing
of
di
except
her
wedding
cards
would
sail
across
the
sea
but
as
it
turned
out
home
birds
were
wary
and
we
crept
back
to
ireland
in
time
for
the
horse
show
with
diana
empty
handed
and
father
with
pockets
cleaned
out
it
was
then
that
di
seriously
set
her
thoughts
upon
the
new
world
new
worlds
it
is
said
being
easier
to
conquer
than
old
ones
father
had
two
or
three
acquaintances
in
the
diplomatic
service
at
washington
he
hoped
to
squeeze
invitations
out
of
them
for
in
a
country
entirely
populated
by
monotonous
misters
and
with
nothing
more
decorative
than
a
colonel
or
a
general
or
a
judge
even
a
poor
irish
earl
is
to
be
sneezed
at
di
need
be
handicapped
by
every
one
remembering
that
her
mother
would
have
described
herself
as
a
music
and
several
americans
living
in
new
york
had
asked
us
to
their
houses
at
first
it
was
proposed
to
take
me
if
the
family
went
and
the
thought
of
going
through
again
what
i
had
endured
when
seeing
di
and
eagle
march
together
kept
me
from
raising
my
voice
in
persuasion
it
would
be
heartwearing
to
be
left
behind
never
to
know
what
was
happening
except
from
an
occasional
letter
but
to
be
on
the
spot
and
see
for
myself
would
be
heartbreaking
i
was
quite
sure
which
would
be
worse
so
i
left
the
decision
to
fate
and
as
i
said
before
it
was
my
frenchified
genius
for
doing
hair
which
settled
the
matter
di
discussed
it
with
father
frankly
before
me
and
argued
that
not
only
was
i
cleverer
than
the
average
maid
but
actually
cheaper
besides
she
finished
peggy
dear
would
like
to
go
and
she
not
a
bad
little
thing
who
knows
but
she
might
pick
up
something
over
there
for
herself
a
picker
up
of
unconsidered
trifles
the
scotched
not
killed
minx
in
me
could
resist
quoting
at
the
suggestion
that
i
was
welcome
to
leavings
if
i
could
bag
them
but
neither
father
nor
di
was
paying
the
slightest
attention
by
superhuman
efforts
in
borrowing
and
perhaps
begging
i
would
put
it
past
him
and
selling
the
portrait
of
our
ancestor
father
scraped
up
enough
money
to
take
us
to
america
and
have
a
little
over
for
travelling
expenses
there
further
than
that
he
did
not
look
for
we
should
be
living
board
free
most
of
the
time
and
besides
something
was
almost
sure
to
turn
up
in
december
we
sailed
on
a
slow
cheap
ship
and
once
on
the
other
side
lived
for
six
weeks
like
the
lord
and
ladies
we
were
upon
friends
di
had
carefully
collected
as
if
they
were
rare
foreign
stamps
or
postcards
in
london
during
the
past
season
most
of
these
she
had
met
through
eagle
she
had
a
gorgeous
time
and
even
i
came
in
for
plenty
of
fun
because
it
seems
that
a
girl
in
america
ceases
to
flap
while
she
is
still
quite
young
i
was
strictly
reduced
by
my
elders
to
just
sixteen
although
my
seventeenth
birthday
was
upon
me
but
there
were
men
in
new
york
not
above
talking
or
tangoing
with
a
girl
of
sixteen
and
my
hair
though
only
looped
up
flapper
fashion
with
a
ribbon
was
actually
admired
i
saw
it
in
the
newspapers
not
the
hair
but
the
admiration
never
were
people
so
hospitable
as
those
kind
ones
in
new
york
and
never
were
houses
more
beautiful
or
more
luxurious
than
theirs
i
had
never
seen
anything
quite
like
them
at
home
but
it
was
the
luxury
that
stirred
in
my
heart
a
wondering
love
for
america
i
began
to
feel
it
from
the
very
moment
when
our
cheap
liner
brought
us
into
the
harbour
and
the
statue
of
liberty
about
which
eagle
had
told
me
was
suddenly
unveiled
to
my
eyes
from
behind
a
curtain
of
silver
mist
the
thrill
warmed
my
blood
and
i
had
the
sensation
of
being
at
home
as
if
i
were
coming
to
stay
with
kinsfolk
a
dim
but
deep
conviction
that
i
that
there
was
a
place
for
me
we
were
doing
something
from
morning
till
night
or
rather
till
the
next
morning
and
the
air
was
like
a
tonic
to
keep
us
up
to
the
work
of
play
luncheons
and
dinners
and
dances
were
given
for
di
and
she
was
written
and
talked
about
as
the
beautiful
lady
diana
but
though
she
had
proposals
nothing
better
offered
than
captain
march
whose
rich
aunt
cabot
lived
in
new
york
and
proved
to
be
the
genuine
article
consequently
we
turned
our
attention
to
washington
washington
also
turned
its
attention
to
us
and
made
itself
agreeable
to
father
and
diana
place
and
people
were
both
fascinating
and
we
had
five
weeks
more
of
dinners
and
dances
without
the
result
we
all
knew
in
our
secret
souls
we
had
come
to
get
the
men
who
wanted
di
she
did
want
and
vice
versa
so
at
length
we
came
to
the
last
item
marked
on
our
programme
a
visit
to
the
fashionable
alvarado
springs
close
to
fort
alvarado
in
arizona
where
captain
march
was
stationed
it
was
the
end
of
march
when
we
arrived
at
alvarado
and
the
newspapers
were
thickly
sprinkled
with
the
name
of
the
mexican
president
huerta
printed
in
big
black
letters
a
few
weeks
ago
the
name
would
have
meant
nothing
to
me
but
i
had
lived
in
vain
in
washington
for
more
than
a
month
if
the
name
of
a
mexican
president
or
general
who
had
done
anything
conspicuous
during
the
past
six
years
had
been
suddenly
flung
at
my
head
as
in
the
children
game
where
they
shout
beast
bird
fish
and
you
answer
before
the
count
of
three
i
could
have
told
who
he
was
and
whether
the
conspicuous
deed
had
been
good
or
bad
at
alvarado
we
had
thought
to
be
past
invitation
zone
and
father
had
been
fearfully
hoarding
his
resources
at
the
expense
of
his
friends
to
hold
out
against
high
charges
at
a
big
hotel
there
was
said
to
be
a
very
big
one
indeed
at
the
springs
with
bills
to
match
but
at
the
eleventh
hour
one
of
father
devoted
band
of
rich
widows
the
widows
thoughtfully
provided
for
him
by
deceased
financiers
took
a
furnished
cottage
there
and
asked
us
to
visit
her
she
was
an
unusually
nice
widow
whose
husband
had
made
a
fortune
through
inventing
gollywogs
with
different
eyes
from
other
gollywogs
the
strain
had
given
him
a
weak
heart
and
he
had
died
the
widow
name
was
main
and
di
shamelessly
christened
her
the
main
chance
she
certainly
ours
main
whom
we
met
in
new
york
dashed
off
to
alvarado
springs
a
fortnight
ahead
of
us
in
time
to
get
acquainted
through
letters
of
introduction
with
the
officers
at
fort
alvarado
and
the
wives
of
those
who
had
any
also
to
put
the
furnished
cottage
as
she
called
it
there
must
have
been
fifteen
or
twenty
rooms
in
order
and
the
night
we
arrived
after
our
long
but
utterly
fascinating
journey
she
gave
a
dinner
in
honour
of
father
and
diana
i
had
been
tremendously
interested
in
the
whole
trip
from
washington
to
arizona
and
with
the
first
glimpse
i
had
of
the
romantic
springs
i
felt
a
thrilling
sensation
that
it
was
a
place
where
things
were
bound
to
happen
the
hotel
as
all
who
have
heard
of
alvarado
must
know
stands
in
the
midst
of
a
young
forest
overlooking
a
canon
that
for
colour
is
like
a
vast
cup
full
of
rainbows
and
beyond
the
forest
to
the
left
is
the
garrison
from
the
higher
stories
of
the
hotel
you
can
see
the
red
roofs
of
the
officers
quarters
and
farther
away
the
barracks
and
the
big
bare
drill
ground
but
from
the
wide
verandas
no
houses
are
anywhere
visible
except
the
colony
of
cottages
built
in
spanish
fashion
like
the
hotel
itself
each
having
its
own
little
garden
with
a
flowery
hedge
from
the
glorified
cottage
main
had
taken
we
could
walk
up
to
a
dance
at
the
hotel
in
five
minutes
i
think
eagle
would
have
liked
to
meet
us
at
the
railway
station
but
di
had
plenty
of
excuses
for
not
allowing
that
he
had
met
main
however
and
in
the
afternoon
he
called
father
was
out
prospering
round
the
little
town
and
visiting
the
smart
club
at
which
he
had
been
put
up
as
an
honorary
member
di
and
our
hostess
she
made
us
call
her
kitty
a
sprightly
name
to
which
she
struggled
to
live
up
to
were
in
the
garden
when
eagle
came
but
i
happened
to
be
in
the
with
a
book
so
i
had
about
five
minutes
alone
with
him
before
main
black
butler
found
the
others
i
had
tried
as
a
young
girl
would
no
doubt
have
tried
to
get
over
being
in
love
with
captain
march
i
had
just
simply
said
to
myself
that
the
kind
of
unhappiness
which
loving
him
made
me
suffer
was
better
than
any
little
wretched
pretence
at
happiness
i
could
hope
for
by
putting
him
out
of
my
mind
so
i
had
basked
in
the
painful
luxury
of
thinking
about
him
constantly
and
dreaming
dreams
of
how
i
might
serve
or
sacrifice
myself
for
him
and
win
his
passionate
gratitude
consequently
when
i
raised
my
eyes
from
the
spanish
novel
i
wanted
to
translate
and
saw
eagle
march
come
in
at
the
door
i
loved
him
a
thousand
times
more
than
ever
i
do
know
if
an
unprejudiced
person
would
call
him
actually
handsome
but
i
thought
there
could
be
on
earth
a
man
worth
comparing
with
that
soldier
he
was
glad
to
meet
his
dear
little
pal
again
because
of
what
he
could
get
out
of
her
about
his
loved
one
he
did
hold
back
his
eagerness
long
enough
to
rattle
off
why
peggy
you
growing
up
by
jove
you
almost
a
woman
are
you
and
a
pretty
one
too
though
kept
your
impish
look
i
glad
to
see
but
that
was
only
the
preface
as
soon
as
he
decently
could
he
turned
the
conversation
to
diana
how
was
she
as
beautiful
as
ever
though
of
course
she
was
did
she
ever
speak
of
him
he
passed
sleepless
nights
after
reading
newspaper
paragraphs
which
reported
her
on
the
eve
of
an
engagement
with
this
man
or
that
disgustingly
rich
overfed
brutes
was
there
a
grain
of
truth
in
any
of
the
reports
no
thank
heaven
well
then
perhaps
there
was
a
sporting
chance
for
him
after
all
but
just
like
my
luck
he
went
on
half
laughing
a
chap
here
who
as
formidable
as
any
of
them
a
regular
gun
latest
make
and
improvements
his
vandyke
only
a
major
all
the
same
he
got
a
pot
of
money
hardly
a
man
in
the
army
as
rich
as
he
is
if
there
one
soldiering
means
only
fun
for
him
most
of
us
here
are
like
me
or
if
they
come
from
generations
of
soldiers
as
i
do
they
in
the
service
for
a
career
vandyke
will
probably
resign
if
he
gets
bored
he
dining
at
this
house
notice
him
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
him
afterward
will
you
you
coming
too
are
you
i
asked
main
kitty
said
you
were
and
i
was
so
glad
i
should
say
i
was
coming
he
exclaimed
catch
me
giving
vandyke
a
clear
field
at
the
start
if
he
my
superior
officer
you
see
vandyke
but
on
the
name
as
if
it
were
her
cue
diana
floated
in
and
main
steamed
in
with
her
through
one
of
the
long
windows
which
opened
on
to
the
veranda
after
that
i
ceased
to
exist
di
wore
white
that
night
for
the
dinner
party
a
good
deal
of
what
father
was
saving
in
hotel
bills
he
put
into
clothes
for
her
it
was
a
new
dress
and
sparkled
all
over
like
a
moonlit
lily
crusted
with
dew
i
had
a
fancy
to
put
on
the
frock
with
roses
on
it
which
i
bought
at
selfridge
so
many
months
ago
with
the
money
paid
me
by
eagle
for
my
mother
lace
the
dress
was
still
alive
and
on
active
service
though
the
roses
began
to
look
somewhat
sat
upon
and
eagle
had
never
seen
me
in
it
not
that
he
would
notice
me
now
but
i
had
a
queer
feeling
of
sentiment
about
the
gown
and
often
i
had
told
myself
that
never
never
would
i
throw
it
away
i
should
have
had
a
much
queerer
feeling
if
known
all
that
was
yet
to
come
of
my
first
meeting
with
eagle
march
in
the
wardour
street
curiosity
shop
kitty
main
had
explained
that
it
was
to
be
a
big
tiresome
dinner
on
our
first
night
merely
a
few
people
she
thought
dear
lord
ballyconal
and
lady
di
would
like
to
meet
and
who
would
love
to
know
them
little
peggy
too
of
course
with
a
belated
gasp
of
politeness
for
me
there
would
be
besides
ourselves
only
and
tony
dalziel
of
new
york
their
pretty
daughter
millicent
just
out
their
son
lieutenant
dalziel
tony
too
major
vandyke
and
captain
march
who
was
already
our
friend
the
gossips
did
suggest
kitty
had
gone
on
to
hint
that
millicent
dalziel
was
rather
throwing
herself
at
captain
march
head
if
an
heiress
could
be
said
to
throw
herself
at
the
head
of
a
poor
man
but
of
course
milly
would
have
a
look
in
now
if
dear
lady
di
had
any
attention
to
spare
for
eagleston
march
di
however
was
to
be
taken
in
to
dinner
by
major
vandyke
and
millicent
dalziel
by
captain
march
it
was
probable
that
milly
would
give
him
much
chance
for
talk
with
lady
di
although
he
was
to
sit
beside
her
good
little
peggy
would
have
young
tony
so
nice
for
both
of
them
and
dear
lord
ballyconal
would
be
placed
between
his
hostess
and
dalziel
i
ought
to
have
had
eyes
only
for
my
special
prey
lieutenant
dalziel
but
whether
i
pleased
or
bored
him
seemed
so
comparatively
unimportant
that
before
the
guests
began
to
arrive
i
found
my
faculties
preparing
to
concentrate
elsewhere
di
had
mentioned
the
name
of
major
vandyke
while
i
did
her
hair
or
melted
and
poured
her
into
the
sparkly
frock
but
i
felt
her
consciousness
of
him
in
the
air
and
when
his
name
was
announced
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
my
heart
gave
a
jump
as
if
it
wanted
to
peer
over
the
high
wall
of
the
future
he
came
before
any
of
the
others
so
i
had
time
to
make
a
quick
study
of
him
in
my
brain
i
say
black
and
white
because
you
would
always
think
of
sidney
vandyke
in
black
and
white
an
artist
sketching
him
on
the
cover
of
a
magazine
would
need
no
other
colour
to
express
the
man
except
if
he
had
it
handy
a
dash
of
red
for
the
full
lips
under
the
black
moustache
major
vandyke
the
soft
drawling
voice
of
kitty
negro
butler
proclaimed
him
and
that
was
when
my
heart
knocked
its
alarm
kitty
main
generally
described
people
in
superlatives
so
i
had
been
excited
when
she
remarked
that
major
vandyke
was
the
man
in
the
army
but
this
time
she
seemed
not
to
have
exaggerated
there
be
a
handsomer
man
in
any
army
or
out
of
it
and
a
horrid
sly
little
voice
whispered
to
me
what
a
couple
he
and
di
would
make
i
was
standing
far
in
the
background
at
a
window
opposite
the
door
while
the
others
were
grouped
together
more
in
the
foreground
and
what
i
saw
was
a
very
tall
man
so
tall
that
he
could
dwarf
eagle
five
foot
ten
almost
to
insignificance
six
foot
two
perhaps
and
not
stout
yet
but
showing
signs
that
one
day
he
might
become
so
i
noticed
that
he
held
himself
magnificently
his
broad
shoulders
thrown
back
his
head
up
and
that
he
walked
with
a
slight
swagger
more
like
a
cavalryman
than
an
officer
in
the
artillery
perhaps
it
was
the
electric
light
which
made
his
skin
look
as
white
as
diana
without
a
touch
of
the
tan
that
darkened
eagle
march
fairer
complexion
but
the
white
was
of
a
different
quality
somehow
from
diana
hers
is
pearl
white
his
had
the
thick
untranslucent
look
which
pale
jewish
faces
have
i
know
then
that
sidney
vandyke
was
of
hebrew
blood
but
afterward
i
heard
that
his
mother
had
spanish
jews
for
ancestors
on
one
side
and
that
with
her
came
most
of
the
family
money
he
was
in
full
dress
uniform
which
became
him
splendidly
and
i
had
a
glimpse
of
a
rather
large
face
drawn
with
square
straight
lines
that
gave
it
a
relentless
look
square
white
forehead
straight
black
brows
straight
short
nose
large
squarely
opened
dark
eyes
brilliant
and
straight
black
moustache
thick
square
red
lips
square
chin
and
a
full
neck
set
on
square
shoulders
after
that
first
glimpse
i
saw
only
the
profile
for
in
meeting
kitty
main
and
being
introduced
to
di
and
father
major
vandyke
had
to
turn
half
away
from
me
even
a
profile
however
tells
something
and
when
major
vandyke
began
to
talk
to
di
bending
down
a
little
i
could
see
that
he
admired
her
very
much
or
else
wanted
to
convey
this
impression
to
her
mind
next
came
eagle
march
very
slim
and
boyish
in
shape
and
size
compared
to
major
vandyke
though
he
ca
be
more
than
six
years
younger
and
hardly
had
he
time
to
greet
his
hostess
and
look
wistfully
at
di
when
the
dalziels
arrived
a
party
of
four
i
thought
that
the
father
and
mother
a
dear
little
merry
couple
curiously
like
each
other
and
like
billiken
looked
too
young
and
irresponsible
to
be
parents
of
anything
grown
up
but
perhaps
they
had
married
when
they
were
almost
children
for
lieutenant
dalziel
who
was
inches
taller
than
his
father
had
the
happy
air
of
being
twenty
two
or
three
and
main
had
said
that
the
girl
was
just
out
young
tony
eyes
skin
and
hair
clean
shaven
smiling
with
teeth
white
and
even
as
kernels
of
american
corn
was
a
glorified
edition
of
his
billiken
father
miss
dalziel
milly
was
not
a
bit
like
any
of
the
others
who
had
all
been
cut
from
the
same
pattern
and
painted
with
the
same
paint
she
was
even
slimmer
and
smaller
than
i
am
very
fair
with
a
few
freckles
and
lots
of
blue
veins
at
her
temples
she
had
an
obstinate
pink
button
of
a
mouth
dimples
which
she
made
come
and
go
every
minute
by
working
the
muscles
of
her
cheeks
bright
fluffy
red
hair
done
high
on
her
head
floating
eyes
of
gray
green
and
blackened
brows
and
lashes
which
i
suppose
had
started
life
in
red
she
gave
an
effect
of
prettiness
and
of
thinking
herself
prettier
than
she
was
an
opinion
in
which
her
had
backed
her
up
tony
dalziel
was
jolly
and
said
so
many
quaint
things
in
priceless
slang
that
he
kept
me
laughing
but
i
had
eyes
if
not
ears
only
for
di
and
major
vandyke
say
he
rushing
your
sister
is
he
making
a
direct
frontal
attack
what
remarked
my
neighbour
so
it
must
have
been
conspicuous
one
could
see
major
vandyke
consciously
absorbing
diana
throwing
over
her
head
a
veil
of
his
own
magnetism
as
if
to
hide
her
in
it
from
other
men
and
make
her
forget
their
existence
as
for
di
she
behaved
perfectly
if
she
wished
to
fascinate
and
tantalize
a
flirt
such
as
sidney
vandyke
was
said
to
be
she
let
herself
seem
to
fall
under
his
spell
and
then
suddenly
slipped
gently
away
turning
to
captain
march
who
sat
at
her
other
side
she
would
talk
to
him
in
a
friendly
intimate
way
in
a
low
voice
with
little
happy
outbursts
of
laughter
over
their
reminiscences
of
a
year
ago
then
half
apologetically
she
would
turn
back
to
vandyke
again
raising
and
letting
fall
her
eyelashes
in
a
way
entirely
her
own
which
somehow
gives
the
effect
of
a
blush
it
was
victorian
or
edwardian
at
latest
but
much
more
useful
than
any
substitute
girls
have
invented
since
that
night
began
the
battle
which
was
to
have
so
strange
a
finish
i
do
know
if
major
vandyke
was
serious
at
first
perhaps
he
wanted
no
more
than
a
good
flirtation
with
a
pretty
girl
one
of
the
prettiest
he
had
ever
seen
and
desperately
loved
by
a
brother
officer
you
see
he
had
probably
heard
already
from
kitty
main
who
told
everything
she
knew
and
a
great
deal
she
did
know
that
captain
march
was
in
love
with
di
just
as
we
heard
from
the
same
source
that
major
vandyke
was
jealous
of
his
junior
because
of
flying
exploits
and
honours
i
think
though
that
from
the
moment
they
met
di
never
meant
to
let
the
man
go
free
she
saw
that
he
was
flirting
and
was
angry
that
he
should
dare
this
put
her
on
her
mettle
and
diana
on
her
mettle
was
and
ever
will
be
formidable
because
of
her
cleverness
which
never
lets
the
mettle
show
she
determined
that
sidney
vandyke
should
fall
in
love
over
ears
and
eyes
in
love
and
he
did
but
she
was
satisfied
even
with
that
she
could
bear
to
have
eagle
march
escape
and
perhaps
be
snapped
up
by
milly
dalziel
who
was
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
fishpond
with
her
hook
baited
oh
it
must
have
been
an
amusing
little
comedy
for
outsiders
to
watch
and
i
was
an
outsider
in
a
way
but
it
did
amuse
me
i
was
sick
at
heart
and
cross
with
tony
dalziel
who
would
leave
me
alone
or
give
me
time
to
think
things
over
this
sort
of
maneuvering
lasted
for
three
weeks
then
a
bombshell
fell
in
our
midst
two
batteries
of
the
th
artillery
were
ordered
immediately
to
el
paso
on
the
mexican
border
where
a
raid
was
apparently
threatened
major
vandyke
and
captain
march
and
lieutenant
dalziel
were
all
to
go
chapter
vi
there
was
desolation
at
alvarado
springs
in
the
hotel
and
in
the
people
when
i
say
people
i
mean
women
did
come
to
alvarado
to
drink
the
celebrated
waters
or
to
admire
the
wonderful
scenery
they
came
to
play
with
the
officers
and
now
the
bravest
and
best
looking
were
to
be
snatched
from
them
what
had
happened
or
what
might
happen
was
a
mystery
to
mere
civilians
but
it
was
whispered
about
that
possibly
there
might
be
real
fighting
at
el
paso
there
must
have
been
everybody
said
something
serious
under
the
rumours
of
a
threatened
attack
from
across
the
rio
grande
otherwise
government
would
not
be
sending
troops
to
reinforce
the
large
garrison
at
fort
bliss
or
be
offering
to
take
women
and
children
away
from
the
river
towns
in
armoured
trains
if
desired
cavalry
and
infantry
were
moving
south
from
other
army
posts
we
heard
to
guard
the
concentration
camp
of
mexican
refugee
prisoners
at
el
paso
and
to
beat
back
a
rabble
of
invaders
if
need
came
the
order
reached
alvarado
late
in
the
afternoon
and
the
batteries
were
to
leave
by
train
at
four
the
next
morning
as
it
happened
kitty
main
father
di
and
i
were
all
invited
to
a
dance
that
evening
at
the
house
of
an
officer
and
his
wife
captain
and
kilburn
but
when
the
news
about
the
batteries
going
away
began
to
flash
from
cottage
to
cottage
we
expected
the
party
to
be
given
up
di
looked
rather
blank
when
main
flung
the
tidings
at
her
for
sidney
vandyke
proposed
yet
if
the
dance
were
abandoned
he
might
be
too
busy
getting
his
men
ready
to
see
her
before
he
left
and
heaven
alone
knew
when
the
batteries
would
come
back
there
might
be
fighting
there
might
at
worst
even
be
war
with
mexico
and
whatever
happened
we
could
stay
on
indefinitely
at
alvarado
kitty
main
had
taken
the
cottage
and
asked
us
to
visit
her
only
for
six
weeks
besides
alvarado
would
be
desolate
without
our
best
friends
and
possible
lovers
i
could
see
these
thoughts
developing
and
following
on
one
heels
in
diana
mind
but
in
my
head
there
was
nothing
concrete
enough
to
call
a
thought
feelings
seemed
to
have
raced
upstairs
from
heart
to
brain
and
driven
ideas
out
of
the
house
they
ran
wildly
round
and
round
saying
to
each
other
what
if
i
never
see
him
again
what
if
he
should
be
killed
but
while
we
were
in
this
state
kilburn
telephoned
to
kitty
main
that
she
had
decided
to
have
her
dance
in
spite
of
all
her
husband
was
not
among
those
ordered
away
and
the
officers
who
were
going
had
arranged
to
spare
time
to
look
in
for
three
or
four
dances
in
any
case
some
of
them
might
be
very
early
some
very
late
but
there
would
be
plenty
of
other
men
to
go
round
and
kilburn
suggested
that
we
might
keep
things
up
long
enough
to
see
the
soldiers
off
at
dawn
before
motoring
back
to
the
springs
if
that
would
interest
lady
diana
and
lady
peggy
there
was
only
one
answer
to
this
and
when
we
went
over
to
fort
alvarado
for
the
dance
we
put
on
warmer
cloaks
than
we
should
have
worn
ordinarily
kilburn
had
brought
her
husband
money
and
as
she
loved
gayety
she
had
somehow
got
permission
to
build
on
to
the
captain
quarters
a
ballroom
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
a
wide
veranda
consequently
a
dance
at
the
kilburns
was
worth
going
to
always
and
particularly
on
this
moonlight
night
of
april
when
the
whole
fort
was
humming
with
excitement
the
officers
who
were
ordered
away
had
their
hands
full
of
work
yet
the
young
ones
managed
to
get
off
duty
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
long
enough
to
snatch
a
dance
or
two
with
the
girls
they
liked
best
or
to
sit
out
with
them
on
the
veranda
where
there
were
colonies
of
chairs
and
garden
seats
and
hammocks
tony
dalziel
was
one
of
those
who
came
early
to
the
kilburns
he
had
asked
me
beforehand
for
six
dances
and
i
had
given
him
three
when
he
appeared
it
was
just
in
time
for
the
first
a
the
second
would
follow
directly
after
and
the
third
i
knew
already
from
a
note
sent
me
in
haste
he
would
have
to
miss
do
you
care
for
this
he
asked
out
of
breath
with
his
hurry
to
dress
and
sprint
over
from
the
line
of
bachelors
quarters
if
you
do
will
you
come
outside
and
see
the
moon
rise
it
going
to
be
a
great
sight
there
is
no
poetry
in
a
and
if
there
were
it
would
have
been
lost
in
hopping
up
and
down
with
tony
so
i
chose
the
moon
i
thought
the
moon
a
perfectly
safe
object
to
gaze
at
with
such
a
jolly
young
man
who
made
jokes
at
everything
in
the
heavens
or
upon
the
earth
and
unsuspectingly
i
went
with
him
to
a
nook
on
the
veranda
screened
off
with
tall
plants
from
an
adjacent
hammock
it
was
a
nook
intended
for
two
and
no
more
there
were
a
great
many
nooks
of
that
sort
on
kilburn
veranda
she
specialized
in
flirtation
architecture
tell
me
about
everything
please
i
cheerfully
began
we
have
very
long
have
we
that
the
worst
of
it
said
tony
and
that
why
i
must
be
careful
to
tell
you
only
the
important
things
there
just
one
that
really
interests
me
what
that
i
asked
eagerly
i
hope
not
that
you
expect
fighting
no
such
luck
i
afraid
but
i
not
worrying
about
that
now
what
i
want
to
tell
you
is
this
and
to
my
stupefaction
he
shot
a
proposal
at
my
head
as
if
it
came
out
of
a
field
gun
i
knew
he
liked
me
and
liked
to
be
with
me
but
i
could
associate
the
idea
of
anything
so
serious
as
marriage
with
tony
dalziel
i
gasped
and
said
he
could
mean
it
but
he
assured
me
that
he
did
and
a
dictionary
full
of
other
assurances
besides
perhaps
if
i
had
not
seen
eagle
march
and
fallen
in
love
with
him
once
and
forever
i
might
have
thought
twice
before
saying
no
to
tony
if
only
for
the
pride
of
being
engaged
sooner
than
di
and
when
i
yet
eighteen
tony
dalziel
was
what
all
women
call
such
a
dear
and
besides
he
had
or
would
have
plenty
of
money
a
consideration
in
our
family
i
could
imagine
what
a
rage
father
would
be
in
with
me
if
he
knew
what
i
was
doing
at
that
moment
calmly
refusing
a
opportunity
but
eagle
march
though
he
was
not
for
me
made
all
the
difference
and
put
my
heart
into
a
convent
where
it
was
now
undergoing
its
novitiate
i
let
the
opportunity
slip
and
told
tony
how
sorry
i
was
to
hurt
him
but
he
was
inclined
to
take
that
for
an
answer
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
would
leave
it
open
in
case
anything
happened
to
make
me
change
my
mind
i
warned
him
that
so
far
as
i
could
see
i
would
never
change
it
but
if
an
optimist
will
op
as
tony
remarked
what
can
you
do
you
ca
prevent
his
opping
and
rather
than
hear
an
irrevocable
word
he
bade
me
while
i
protested
this
was
in
the
midst
of
what
should
have
been
his
second
dance
and
i
feel
equal
to
going
indoors
again
directly
after
that
scene
even
to
tango
i
asked
tony
to
leave
me
where
i
was
to
gather
up
my
wits
and
when
he
had
darted
away
i
sat
quite
still
for
a
few
minutes
i
had
no
engagement
until
the
time
for
my
one
dance
with
eagle
march
should
come
and
as
tony
had
given
me
much
chance
for
gazing
at
the
great
sight
he
had
brought
me
out
to
see
i
tried
to
cool
my
brain
with
moonlight
but
i
had
forgotten
all
about
the
hammock
on
the
other
side
of
the
flower
screen
i
remembered
it
only
when
i
heard
footsteps
and
a
creaking
of
chairs
as
some
one
or
rather
some
two
sat
down
good
gracious
i
said
to
myself
what
shall
i
do
for
as
the
pair
came
to
a
halt
they
went
on
with
their
conversation
which
had
evidently
reached
a
critical
point
i
recognized
the
man
voice
and
as
it
was
that
of
eagle
march
i
knew
as
well
as
if
i
had
already
seen
her
that
the
girl
must
be
diana
i
knew
also
that
she
would
never
forgive
me
if
i
popped
out
at
this
moment
like
the
wrong
figure
on
a
barometer
nothing
on
earth
would
make
her
believe
that
i
had
been
spying
for
though
di
did
realize
how
much
and
in
what
way
i
cared
for
eagle
she
often
teased
me
about
being
jealous
because
my
great
chum
had
forsaken
me
for
her
if
at
any
time
she
could
call
him
away
from
me
by
a
glance
or
a
smile
it
amused
her
to
do
so
and
she
would
believe
i
was
revenging
myself
in
the
best
way
i
could
on
this
their
last
night
i
had
half
jumped
up
from
the
low
seat
which
tony
had
shared
with
me
but
on
second
thoughts
i
sat
down
again
she
wo
let
him
say
much
i
thought
so
there
be
nothing
to
overhear
anyhow
i
can
stop
my
ears
if
worst
comes
to
worst
but
before
i
had
time
to
resolve
on
this
precaution
i
heard
eagle
say
if
it
was
for
the
money
i
should
feel
i
had
the
right
the
rest
was
silence
for
i
kept
my
resolution
and
refused
to
catch
another
syllable
yet
those
words
had
set
me
thinking
hard
if
eagle
were
telling
di
that
he
was
now
certain
to
come
in
for
his
fortune
she
might
look
upon
him
as
a
bird
in
the
hand
whereas
a
notorious
flirt
like
major
vandyke
might
be
worth
no
more
than
two
in
the
bush
with
the
saltcellar
empty
i
struggled
to
find
consolation
by
reminding
myself
that
if
di
did
marry
eagle
she
might
make
him
happy
provided
there
were
enough
money
for
everything
she
wanted
and
if
he
were
willing
to
cut
the
army
for
her
sake
and
live
mostly
in
england
she
was
an
or
girl
when
things
went
as
she
wished
i
reflected
and
if
he
were
content
to
sacrifice
his
career
for
love
of
her
they
might
get
on
very
well
together
but
what
words
to
use
in
connection
with
eagle
march
get
on
well
together
he
was
one
to
be
satisfied
with
mere
contentment
where
he
had
hoped
for
rapture
i
sat
with
my
ears
stopped
until
suddenly
the
two
began
speaking
in
a
much
louder
tone
and
a
third
voice
that
of
a
man
joined
the
conversation
then
i
decided
that
i
might
come
back
to
life
again
and
as
i
let
my
tired
arms
drop
i
became
aware
that
the
newcomer
was
sidney
vandyke
he
was
telling
di
that
this
was
his
dance
and
that
he
had
been
looking
for
her
everywhere
i
heard
kilburn
mention
that
the
old
man
had
sent
for
you
march
and
i
know
they
on
your
scent
he
announced
in
that
case
i
may
not
see
you
again
lady
diana
eagle
said
peggy
and
i
are
going
with
kilburn
and
a
lot
of
others
to
wave
to
you
for
good
luck
when
you
start
answered
di
rather
nervously
i
thought
i
glad
we
shall
have
a
last
glimpse
of
you
all
replied
eagle
but
i
afraid
i
sha
get
a
word
with
you
then
so
i
bid
you
now
he
spoke
in
quite
a
way
but
i
who
knew
every
tone
of
his
voice
guessed
what
it
covered
and
i
could
almost
feel
the
pressure
of
his
hand
as
it
clasped
di
with
major
vandyke
mercilessly
looking
on
i
wondered
whether
she
had
been
cruel
or
kind
in
a
moment
he
was
gone
and
with
a
stab
of
pain
i
realized
that
if
the
colonel
had
sent
for
him
he
must
miss
out
his
dance
with
me
would
he
even
remember
it
would
he
scribble
me
a
line
of
farewell
i
longed
to
run
out
and
catch
him
before
he
went
if
only
for
a
word
but
i
dared
not
dash
past
di
and
give
her
the
shock
of
learning
that
i
had
been
within
three
yards
of
her
all
the
time
again
i
was
trapped
unless
di
and
major
vandyke
should
go
indoors
to
dance
but
no
sooner
was
eagle
march
out
of
earshot
than
vandyke
asked
di
to
stay
of
course
we
known
all
along
that
we
might
get
marching
orders
he
said
and
there
was
no
harm
in
my
hearing
that
it
a
surprise
only
to
those
outside
the
adjutant
has
been
fussing
over
stores
and
ammunition
and
target
practice
has
been
a
confounded
bore
all
the
same
at
the
end
the
move
been
sprung
on
us
just
when
we
forgotten
to
expect
it
i
feel
as
if
i
wasted
a
lot
of
precious
time
one
way
or
another
but
it
is
too
late
yet
lady
di
if
you
i
stopped
up
my
ears
again
so
effectively
that
i
heard
no
more
and
a
few
minutes
later
was
flabbergasted
when
diana
and
he
suddenly
broke
upon
me
from
behind
the
screen
of
plants
my
first
thought
was
that
di
had
suspected
my
presence
there
and
had
wanted
to
pounce
but
she
gave
a
jump
and
a
cry
of
surprise
as
she
saw
me
sitting
bolt
upright
on
the
bench
with
my
fingers
stuffed
into
my
ears
good
peg
she
gasped
how
long
have
you
been
here
ever
since
before
came
i
answered
i
might
have
put
it
differently
by
telling
tales
and
so
serving
eagle
march
cause
perhaps
but
no
matter
how
thoroughly
i
disapproved
of
her
i
give
my
own
sister
away
i
did
like
to
come
out
you
see
for
fear
you
might
like
it
but
i
have
heard
anything
you
said
if
interests
you
to
know
i
do
care
whether
you
heard
or
not
said
di
trying
to
speak
playfully
but
unable
to
keep
sharpness
out
of
her
tone
major
vandyke
thought
this
was
a
nicer
seat
than
the
hammock
to
rest
in
so
he
brought
me
to
it
of
course
we
no
idea
any
one
was
was
here
well
there
wo
be
any
one
now
i
free
to
move
i
snapped
only
too
thankful
to
have
a
chance
to
get
back
to
the
ballroom
made
me
miss
a
dance
made
you
i
like
that
gurgled
di
but
i
waited
for
no
more
i
skipped
away
toward
the
nearest
long
window
without
looking
round
and
was
just
in
time
to
meet
my
partner
in
search
of
me
the
partner
after
eagle
march
and
a
brother
officer
of
his
our
dance
said
he
and
here
something
march
asked
me
to
hand
you
he
been
called
away
the
something
was
a
leaf
torn
out
of
a
notebook
and
neatly
folded
into
a
cocked
hat
it
was
rather
appropriate
that
eagle
to
me
should
come
in
this
form
because
i
had
given
him
the
notebook
for
a
birthday
present
only
the
week
before
i
saved
up
my
pennies
to
get
a
good
one
and
have
his
initials
in
silver
fastened
on
to
the
morocco
cover
the
paper
of
the
book
itself
and
the
refills
were
also
khaki
coloured
to
match
the
cover
with
lines
in
very
faint
blue
i
had
wanted
my
little
gift
to
be
as
distinctive
as
possible
and
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
pains
to
choose
a
notebook
different
from
all
others
little
dreaming
what
was
fated
to
hang
on
the
difference
quietly
but
carefully
i
undid
the
paper
cocked
hat
and
read
the
few
pencilled
words
so
disappointed
dear
little
friend
not
to
have
my
dance
with
you
but
i
called
back
to
work
congratulate
me
got
almost
the
promise
i
the
next
best
thing
anyhow
farewell
for
a
while
write
to
me
to
el
paso
like
the
good
girl
you
are
i
shall
look
for
you
at
the
train
morning
early
though
we
may
not
have
a
chance
to
speak
yours
ever
i
folded
up
the
note
and
tucked
it
into
the
neck
of
my
dress
then
i
danced
and
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
danced
yet
i
thought
only
of
one
thing
the
confidence
eagle
had
given
me
apparently
di
had
said
something
calculated
to
send
him
away
happy
but
major
vandyke
had
looked
far
from
sad
when
he
walked
into
the
ballroom
with
di
after
their
on
the
veranda
in
my
deserted
nook
i
felt
something
was
wrong
and
determined
to
have
it
out
with
diana
the
minute
i
could
get
her
alone
my
chance
came
sooner
than
i
expected
for
just
before
supper
she
tore
her
frock
and
wanted
me
to
run
up
with
her
to
the
and
mend
it
a
maid
will
make
an
awful
mess
of
the
thing
she
said
but
you
know
what
to
do
and
it
take
only
a
few
minutes
we
had
the
to
ourselves
for
kilburn
french
maid
who
was
in
charge
had
slipped
away
probably
for
a
sly
peep
at
the
dancing
when
i
had
di
at
my
mercy
holding
her
by
a
trail
of
gold
fringe
i
opened
fire
are
you
engaged
to
eagle
march
i
flashed
out
certainly
not
di
flashed
back
what
makes
you
think
such
a
thing
you
said
you
did
hear
in
haste
she
cut
her
sentence
short
realizing
how
she
had
given
herself
away
she
would
have
gone
on
quickly
but
i
broke
in
you
ask
what
makes
me
think
such
a
thing
when
i
told
you
that
i
hear
a
word
of
your
talk
which
shows
that
if
i
heard
i
have
thought
of
it
well
i
did
not
hear
but
all
the
same
i
think
you
need
then
she
assured
me
if
i
engaged
to
any
one
it
is
to
sidney
vandyke
but
i
tell
you
as
much
as
that
only
to
prove
nothing
between
me
and
captain
march
it
in
strict
confidence
and
you
must
be
sure
and
keep
the
secret
peg
till
i
ready
to
have
it
come
out
nothing
to
be
said
until
this
mexican
bother
is
over
can
you
make
the
fringe
look
right
yes
if
you
give
me
time
i
answered
but
di
i
wo
have
you
playing
tricks
with
eagle
march
i
simply
wo
stand
it
it
horrid
of
you
to
suggest
that
i
would
do
such
a
thing
diana
protested
virtuously
pooh
said
i
secure
in
my
knowledge
that
she
dared
not
move
i
know
you
pretty
well
di
and
although
you
can
be
quite
a
darling
when
you
like
you
do
anything
that
was
for
your
own
interests
no
matter
how
much
it
hurt
others
you
better
tell
me
the
truth
because
i
sure
to
find
out
and
if
you
mean
to
hurt
or
deceive
eagle
march
i
stop
you
from
doing
it
i
do
care
how
much
it
may
cost
me
or
you
or
any
one
else
but
him
if
ever
there
was
a
thorough
little
it
you
peggy
said
di
thorough
pigs
seem
to
run
in
our
family
i
ruthlessly
retorted
but
they
intelligent
animals
and
this
one
has
rooted
up
something
already
i
believe
you
practically
promised
to
marry
these
men
and
persuaded
them
to
keep
the
secret
so
you
can
have
time
to
decide
which
one
will
be
the
better
to
take
in
the
end
you
make
me
out
a
perfect
wretch
di
moaned
piteously
peering
over
her
shoulder
to
see
how
the
repairs
were
getting
on
so
you
are
a
beautiful
one
but
a
wretch
you
like
them
both
eagle
and
major
vandyke
you
like
eagle
because
he
so
popular
and
such
a
hero
as
an
airman
and
you
like
major
vandyke
because
he
awfully
good
looking
and
awfully
rich
and
an
awful
flirt
you
were
worried
to
death
for
fear
he
would
propose
and
i
have
known
from
the
change
in
your
face
even
if
you
had
told
me
that
he
had
spoken
at
last
but
eagle
spoke
too
and
you
sent
him
away
happy
i
know
that
though
the
only
other
thing
i
do
know
for
certain
is
that
you
think
now
he
sure
to
get
his
aunt
money
it
not
such
a
tremendous
lot
anyhow
di
gave
herself
away
again
he
wo
have
more
than
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
at
the
most
if
only
it
were
every
one
says
sidney
vandyke
has
a
million
he
one
of
the
few
very
rich
men
in
the
american
army
but
he
ca
fly
and
he
ca
invent
things
and
he
never
be
the
man
in
any
career
that
eagle
will
i
reminded
her
you
know
this
as
well
as
i
do
that
why
you
waiting
do
you
think
you
better
explain
your
true
state
of
mind
to
me
if
you
do
want
me
to
work
against
you
you
a
cat
as
well
as
a
pig
you
little
horror
what
a
museum
combination
do
twitch
or
the
fringe
will
go
crooked
is
eagle
rich
aunt
likely
to
die
well
yes
she
is
diana
admitted
she
very
old
you
know
had
a
third
stroke
of
paralysis
if
eagle
could
have
got
leave
he
would
have
gone
to
her
but
that
was
out
of
the
question
as
things
are
did
he
tell
you
about
her
or
was
it
some
one
else
who
gave
you
the
news
it
was
some
one
else
of
course
naturally
i
wanted
to
make
sure
so
i
sympathized
with
him
on
his
aunt
illness
he
had
only
just
heard
about
it
himself
he
always
been
fond
of
her
and
he
said
he
have
had
the
heart
to
come
to
a
dance
if
it
had
been
his
last
night
and
the
only
way
to
see
me
before
he
left
for
texas
but
he
told
me
that
cabot
death
would
make
him
comparatively
a
rich
man
those
were
the
words
he
used
i
do
think
he
sure
how
much
he
get
it
was
from
kitty
i
heard
what
cabot
is
likely
to
leave
and
as
is
the
same
as
you
hanging
fire
till
she
dead
i
explained
diana
to
herself
you
make
me
out
heaps
worse
than
i
am
she
reproached
me
if
i
have
given
an
absolutely
definite
answer
to
eagle
march
or
sidney
vandyke
it
it
because
of
this
expedition
they
both
going
on
they
may
get
some
chance
to
distinguish
themselves
you
such
a
practical
little
person
that
you
ca
realize
the
romantic
sort
of
feeling
i
have
about
such
things
if
i
marry
a
man
who
is
of
my
own
country
i
should
like
him
to
be
a
great
hero
whom
every
one
would
read
about
and
admire
i
told
each
of
them
to
work
and
do
his
best
for
my
sake
there
probably
be
no
opportunity
for
anything
heroic
in
such
an
expedition
as
this
said
i
living
up
to
the
reputation
for
practicality
which
di
wished
to
thrust
on
me
in
contrast
with
herself
that
what
they
both
said
she
agreed
but
one
never
knows
and
so
you
get
a
excuse
to
wait
little
viper
the
wo
sting
unless
you
force
it
to
i
guaranteed
there
your
dress
is
all
right
again
you
could
have
finished
five
minutes
ago
if
you
had
been
determined
to
lecture
me
thanks
all
the
same
you
have
your
uses
though
not
always
sweet
like
those
of
adversity
we
went
our
separate
ways
with
the
men
who
were
waiting
to
take
us
in
to
supper
and
we
did
come
together
again
till
the
dance
was
over
and
every
one
but
the
party
specially
asked
to
stay
had
gone
home
we
heard
the
bugles
sounding
reveille
then
presently
the
beat
of
drums
and
the
rumble
of
the
field
guns
going
to
the
station
when
captain
kilburn
announced
that
the
entrainment
was
well
under
way
we
started
in
his
big
limousine
shivering
a
little
in
evening
cloaks
flung
on
hastily
over
dresses
we
waited
till
the
platform
was
clear
of
the
great
mass
of
young
men
and
then
timidly
appeared
to
stare
through
the
dusk
of
early
morning
in
search
of
friends
ours
was
the
only
party
engaged
in
that
business
others
were
there
and
swathed
figures
of
girls
and
women
in
cloaks
over
ball
gowns
glimmered
in
the
dawn
like
a
row
of
tall
flowers
crowding
along
the
edge
of
a
garden
path
my
eyes
were
trying
to
find
eagle
march
when
tony
dalziel
spoke
by
my
shoulder
and
made
me
jump
i
just
a
minute
he
said
when
i
turned
i
want
to
ask
you
if
you
forget
you
turned
me
down
last
night
and
be
friends
again
i
will
if
you
will
you
yes
i
returned
gladly
shaking
hands
i
so
glad
you
realized
that
you
were
silly
to
feel
about
me
like
that
why
you
or
any
man
i
ca
think
ca
you
that
because
you
have
seen
yourself
or
heard
yourself
and
do
know
what
a
quaint
darling
sort
of
girl
you
are
but
never
mind
let
it
go
at
that
we
be
friends
and
promise
if
my
mother
and
milly
ask
you
to
do
something
for
them
you
will
anything
i
possibly
can
i
warmly
answered
good
luck
he
was
off
i
meant
to
follow
him
with
my
eyes
and
wave
to
him
when
he
looked
out
of
his
window
in
the
train
but
before
he
appeared
again
i
caught
sight
of
eagle
march
on
a
car
platform
and
forgot
tony
just
as
eagle
had
forgotten
me
behind
eagle
slight
figure
towered
massively
major
vandyke
splendid
bulk
and
as
i
waved
my
handkerchief
to
eagle
while
the
train
slid
slowly
out
i
was
vaguely
aware
of
outstretched
arm
and
a
butterfly
flutter
of
something
white
and
small
eagle
eyes
went
past
me
to
her
though
his
smile
was
for
me
also
and
di
was
able
deftly
to
kill
her
two
birds
with
one
stone
at
the
last
her
farewell
look
and
gesture
did
equally
well
for
both
yet
each
could
take
it
wholly
to
himself
chapter
vii
the
next
night
i
had
a
dreadful
dream
about
eagle
march
somehow
or
other
he
had
been
condemned
to
death
by
major
vandyke
who
had
unbecomingly
turned
into
a
judge
and
eagle
was
to
be
executed
unless
i
could
arrive
in
time
to
save
him
armed
with
a
reprieve
or
pardon
i
did
quite
know
which
that
i
had
got
from
washington
i
waked
up
crying
out
because
a
hand
had
been
stretched
forth
through
darkness
to
clutch
my
shoulder
and
prevent
me
from
getting
to
el
paso
until
too
late
even
then
when
i
was
wide
awake
the
dream
had
been
so
horribly
vivid
that
i
could
persuade
myself
it
was
true
i
had
always
laughed
at
superstitious
people
who
believed
in
dreams
yet
i
clear
my
mind
of
this
one
or
keep
from
asking
myself
in
a
panic
what
if
it
a
warning
it
seemed
that
after
all
such
things
might
mysteriously
be
alvarado
springs
was
as
dull
as
a
convent
after
the
officers
we
liked
best
had
gone
from
the
fort
and
kitty
proposed
subletting
her
cottage
to
an
invalid
who
for
a
wonder
had
really
come
to
the
place
for
nothing
but
to
take
the
cure
this
rare
creature
was
distressed
by
the
noises
of
the
hotel
and
was
willing
to
pay
more
than
kitty
had
paid
for
the
remaining
few
weeks
of
main
tenancy
our
hostess
was
enchanted
with
the
idea
clapped
her
fat
dimpled
hands
like
a
little
girl
and
proposed
to
blow
the
money
this
was
slang
she
had
delightedly
picked
up
from
father
on
a
motor
tour
to
california
she
had
no
car
of
her
own
but
she
could
hire
one
with
a
chauffeur
we
had
often
taken
for
short
runs
and
at
los
angeles
riverside
santa
barbara
san
francisco
and
other
places
she
had
friends
who
would
shower
invitations
the
trip
would
take
from
two
to
six
weeks
according
to
our
own
desire
then
when
we
were
tired
of
motoring
and
visiting
the
car
would
be
sent
home
and
we
could
have
the
fun
of
going
east
together
by
the
limited
which
kitty
said
was
one
of
the
most
wonderful
trains
in
the
world
this
was
the
proposal
and
it
suited
father
and
di
very
well
each
had
a
reason
for
wishing
to
prolong
the
tour
in
america
if
it
could
be
done
on
the
cheap
di
of
course
wanted
to
see
major
vandyke
or
captain
march
whichever
she
decided
to
take
in
the
end
and
settle
her
affairs
definitely
before
going
home
to
prepare
for
the
wedding
as
to
father
i
began
to
ask
myself
about
this
time
if
he
seriously
thought
of
making
our
main
chance
a
countess
and
counting
her
dollars
into
his
own
pockets
in
any
case
travelling
luxuriously
in
a
land
where
poor
irish
earls
weighed
as
well
in
the
balance
as
a
rich
english
variety
was
better
than
vegetating
at
ballyconal
or
economizing
in
london
so
he
smiled
upon
the
plan
and
i
was
the
one
obstacle
the
only
comfortable
car
that
main
could
get
at
short
notice
was
ideal
for
five
counting
a
chauffeur
and
a
maid
but
close
quarters
for
six
i
be
put
permanently
with
the
chauffeur
and
besides
kitty
looks
were
of
the
sort
that
depend
upon
a
maid
dear
little
peggy
must
just
squeeze
in
somehow
was
her
verdict
although
di
would
temporarily
have
done
without
my
services
rather
than
be
cramped
if
i
could
have
been
disposed
of
elsewhere
she
and
father
put
their
heads
together
and
i
had
begun
to
feel
in
my
bones
that
an
invitation
for
me
from
kilburn
was
to
be
hinted
at
when
dalziel
came
to
the
rescue
her
husband
had
gone
back
to
new
york
long
ago
and
she
and
milly
had
been
wondering
ever
since
tony
orders
came
whether
it
might
be
feasible
to
follow
him
to
el
paso
and
see
what
was
doing
there
he
had
now
wired
that
all
the
women
of
the
neighbourhood
had
refused
to
leave
the
men
that
the
scare
was
dying
down
that
it
looked
as
if
the
imported
troops
would
have
nothing
more
exciting
to
do
than
guard
the
concentration
camp
and
there
was
a
gorgeous
hotel
in
the
town
full
of
rich
spanish
refugees
men
who
were
celebrities
and
women
who
were
beauties
dalziel
had
accordingly
decided
to
venture
and
milly
would
enjoy
the
trip
immensely
if
father
would
let
me
go
with
them
as
their
guest
the
eyes
of
my
family
lighted
at
this
hope
of
liberation
and
i
suddenly
understood
what
tony
last
words
to
me
had
meant
this
was
plan
but
i
wanted
so
violently
to
go
to
el
paso
and
was
so
violently
wanted
to
go
by
father
and
di
that
i
did
stop
to
debate
whether
or
no
it
was
right
to
say
yes
i
simply
said
it
and
hang
the
consequences
di
bade
me
an
affectionate
farewell
with
a
plaintive
reminder
that
a
girl
not
likely
to
be
proposed
to
every
day
might
do
worse
than
tony
dalziel
i
in
turn
reminded
her
that
any
knavish
juggling
with
captain
march
faith
would
be
dealt
with
severely
by
me
and
so
we
parted
she
to
go
her
way
to
california
i
to
go
mine
to
texas
by
santa
fé
trains
i
was
grateful
to
dalziel
and
milly
for
taking
me
though
i
could
help
seeing
that
it
was
not
for
my
they
had
asked
me
to
be
their
guest
i
was
a
handle
or
but
i
preferred
the
part
of
usefulness
to
my
hostesses
to
being
carted
about
by
them
as
an
expensive
luxury
dalziel
really
wanted
me
for
tony
who
had
never
been
denied
anything
short
of
the
moon
that
he
cried
for
milly
wanted
people
to
think
that
she
wanted
me
for
tony
in
order
to
have
an
invincible
ironproof
excuse
for
the
rush
to
el
paso
which
her
friends
of
the
cat
tribe
might
attribute
to
a
different
motive
she
had
been
rather
depressed
at
alvarado
but
began
to
bubble
over
with
wild
spirits
the
moment
we
were
off
for
el
paso
she
said
that
this
would
be
the
great
adventure
of
our
lives
and
she
was
only
sorry
all
danger
along
the
border
was
over
as
we
should
get
the
chance
to
show
how
brave
we
were
it
was
an
interesting
journey
every
stage
of
it
and
at
las
cruces
and
after
we
began
to
realize
how
close
we
were
to
old
mexico
only
the
river
ran
between
us
and
that
mysterious
ancient
land
as
far
removed
in
thought
from
the
united
states
as
though
it
were
an
annex
of
egypt
here
and
there
too
the
rio
grande
which
i
thought
of
geographically
as
a
vast
stream
wide
as
a
lake
was
a
mere
water
serpent
writhing
in
its
shallow
bed
of
mud
this
we
heard
our
fellow
passengers
say
explained
the
late
danger
of
a
raid
it
would
be
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
for
a
party
of
mexicans
to
make
a
dash
across
the
river
and
already
there
had
been
small
private
expeditions
of
cattle
stealers
staring
out
of
the
windows
at
little
adobe
villages
their
huddled
houses
turned
from
brown
to
cubes
of
gold
by
the
afternoon
sun
we
listened
to
all
sorts
of
disquieting
gossip
according
to
the
travellers
who
talked
loudly
to
each
other
across
the
car
the
scare
was
suddenly
on
again
some
more
federals
had
escaped
the
constitutionalist
soldiers
and
got
into
del
rio
where
they
had
been
protected
by
american
soldiers
and
there
had
been
some
shooting
from
one
side
of
the
river
to
the
other
carranza
was
threatening
reprisals
no
one
seemed
to
know
what
villa
attitude
would
be
a
few
american
women
who
had
little
children
had
decided
after
all
to
go
north
at
las
cruces
and
el
paso
you
could
no
longer
buy
a
browning
or
arms
of
any
kind
all
had
been
snapped
up
las
cruces
men
remembering
that
the
militia
was
composed
of
mexicans
had
begun
giving
their
wives
lessons
in
target
practice
at
el
paso
there
was
the
peril
of
the
mexican
population
to
be
faced
in
case
of
attack
from
across
the
river
to
say
nothing
of
the
thousand
mexicans
employed
in
the
smelting
works
down
on
the
flats
and
the
five
thousand
refugees
in
the
concentration
camp
if
they
should
mutiny
and
get
out
of
control
poor
dalziel
drooped
more
and
more
piteously
as
this
ball
of
gossip
was
tossed
from
one
side
of
the
car
to
the
other
and
milly
ever
white
face
grew
so
pale
that
her
freckles
stood
out
conspicuously
she
ceased
to
exclaim
with
excitement
over
the
cowboys
galloping
along
the
road
on
the
united
states
side
of
the
river
or
to
count
the
automobiles
and
the
great
alfalfa
barns
near
small
stations
where
mexican
women
waved
sad
farewells
to
weedy
youths
perhaps
going
to
the
war
of
course
we
not
afraid
for
said
dalziel
we
we
should
want
to
be
near
tony
whatever
happened
it
of
you
we
thinking
peggy
i
do
know
if
we
ought
to
have
brought
you
to
such
a
place
and
i
do
wish
tony
father
were
with
us
anyhow
the
nearer
we
came
to
el
paso
the
more
foreign
and
mexican
the
country
seemed
with
its
wild
purple
mountains
billowing
along
the
sunset
sky
of
red
and
gold
its
queer
groups
of
brown
huts
and
its
men
in
sombreros
or
huge
straw
hats
with
steeple
crowns
it
was
quite
a
relief
to
draw
into
el
paso
station
where
everything
was
suddenly
modern
and
american
and
comfortably
normal
again
tony
had
got
off
duty
to
come
and
meet
us
and
after
the
first
his
mother
began
bombarding
him
with
questions
what
had
happened
what
was
likely
to
happen
would
it
have
been
better
to
telegraph
us
not
to
come
she
and
milly
both
had
the
air
of
eagerly
hoping
that
he
might
after
all
be
able
to
sweep
away
their
fears
with
a
word
or
a
laugh
but
for
once
tony
kept
as
solemn
a
face
as
the
conformation
of
his
benevolent
billiken
features
permitted
there
nothing
at
all
to
worry
about
if
you
do
get
silly
and
panicky
said
he
i
did
think
of
telegraphing
not
because
there
any
real
danger
but
because
i
was
afraid
that
when
you
got
down
here
if
things
had
cleared
up
the
newspaper
and
the
way
they
talk
at
the
hotels
might
give
you
the
jumps
i
could
have
wired
till
after
you
started
though
because
there
was
nothing
doing
before
that
worth
a
telegram
i
thought
it
would
scare
you
blue
if
you
got
a
message
delivered
to
you
in
the
train
saying
better
not
come
or
words
to
that
effect
so
it
seemed
best
to
let
things
rip
now
you
on
the
spot
you
just
keep
your
hair
on
and
do
believe
anything
you
read
or
hear
then
you
be
all
right
my
hair
does
come
off
dearest
objected
dalziel
mildly
which
made
us
laugh
and
that
did
everybody
good
i
bet
lady
peggy
is
afraid
worth
a
cent
tony
remarked
rather
not
said
i
i
would
go
away
no
not
if
you
set
at
me
even
if
dalziel
and
milly
went
i
stay
on
and
volunteer
as
a
nurse
i
can
do
first
aid
and
i
do
mind
the
sight
of
blood
if
there
is
too
much
though
of
course
it
would
be
better
if
it
were
a
peaceful
green
or
blue
instead
of
that
terrifying
red
tony
took
us
in
a
taxi
to
the
paso
del
norte
a
big
hotel
good
enough
for
new
york
or
london
and
even
in
that
short
spin
through
the
streets
we
saw
the
newspaper
extras
being
hawked
about
by
yelling
boys
who
waved
the
papers
to
show
off
their
huge
scarlet
headlines
the
marble
entrance
hall
of
the
hotel
was
crowded
with
people
who
had
just
bought
these
extras
and
were
reading
aloud
of
scare
news
to
each
other
or
discussing
the
situation
in
groups
some
looked
very
spanish
and
tony
said
they
were
refugees
from
the
heart
of
mexico
but
the
women
seemed
to
have
had
plenty
of
time
to
sort
out
and
pack
their
prettiest
clothes
before
they
fled
that
night
eagle
march
was
asked
to
dine
with
us
at
the
hotel
he
sat
between
dalziel
and
milly
and
more
than
once
i
caught
his
eyes
resting
on
me
thoughtfully
almost
wistfully
i
wondered
if
there
were
something
that
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
say
but
milly
kept
him
occupied
even
after
dinner
was
over
and
we
were
having
coffee
in
the
hall
i
was
resigning
myself
to
the
idea
that
we
should
be
given
time
for
a
word
together
when
out
of
the
crowd
appeared
major
vandyke
he
was
with
friends
but
escaped
and
crossed
the
hall
to
shake
hands
with
us
i
noticed
what
stiff
grudging
nods
he
and
eagle
gave
each
other
just
enough
of
a
nod
not
to
be
a
cut
something
disagreeable
had
evidently
happened
between
them
since
they
left
us
at
fort
alvarado
for
in
those
days
no
matter
how
they
felt
they
always
kept
up
the
pretence
of
being
good
enough
friends
when
major
vandyke
had
been
civil
to
me
and
asked
after
my
people
he
began
telling
dalziel
and
milly
things
about
the
state
of
affairs
in
el
paso
you
may
have
come
in
for
a
small
adventure
after
all
said
he
we
had
to
warn
the
occupants
of
some
of
the
tallest
buildings
in
town
that
they
may
be
called
on
to
clear
out
at
five
minutes
notice
if
we
have
trouble
for
their
houses
would
be
in
range
of
gunfire
from
both
sides
but
you
be
all
right
here
at
the
hotel
whatever
happens
we
strong
enough
to
protect
you
he
laughed
and
i
saw
that
he
enjoyed
teasing
timid
little
dalziel
i
thought
that
haughty
we
constantly
coming
in
was
characteristic
of
the
man
and
judging
by
the
odd
expression
which
just
flickered
lightly
across
eagle
face
he
was
thinking
the
same
thing
tony
joined
boyishly
in
the
conversation
to
reassure
his
mother
and
milly
and
eagle
promptly
seized
the
moment
for
a
word
with
me
any
message
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
i
shook
my
head
oh
well
he
said
i
mighty
glad
to
see
you
anyhow
little
girl
lucky
tony
i
rather
jealous
of
him
you
know
i
got
sort
of
in
the
habit
of
thinking
i
had
the
only
claim
i
felt
myself
go
scarlet
what
a
good
thing
one
does
blush
all
colours
of
the
rainbow
for
i
had
the
sensation
of
a
prism
tony
dalziel
may
be
lucky
i
stammered
i
hope
he
is
but
his
luck
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
neither
has
he
except
as
a
friend
that
quite
understood
between
us
oh
is
it
smiled
eagle
i
a
selfish
beast
to
be
glad
but
i
am
i
was
feeling
quite
low
in
my
mind
and
of
it
at
dinner
so
the
wistful
looks
had
been
for
me
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
even
to
have
so
much
place
in
eagle
heart
that
he
did
want
to
lose
me
when
milly
turned
to
him
as
she
did
almost
instantly
for
consolation
after
major
vandyke
teasing
eagle
told
her
while
i
listened
how
very
little
in
his
opinion
there
was
for
any
one
to
fear
it
was
true
of
course
that
the
troops
had
come
to
el
paso
for
a
purpose
every
one
thought
it
had
been
served
by
frightening
out
of
a
certain
faction
of
mexicans
such
vague
secret
hopes
as
they
might
foolishly
have
cherished
now
to
be
sure
the
scare
act
was
being
read
again
but
the
big
field
guns
pointing
across
the
river
were
in
any
case
powerful
enough
to
keep
the
peace
captain
march
wanted
to
know
if
we
would
care
to
visit
the
camps
next
day
if
so
he
would
help
dalziel
arrange
the
visit
this
suggestion
saved
milly
the
trouble
of
hinting
for
it
and
she
was
happy
but
her
happiness
was
destined
to
be
it
was
destroyed
in
the
night
by
a
band
of
vicious
microbes
with
which
she
had
been
fighting
a
silent
battle
during
the
long
journey
to
el
paso
they
won
and
kept
her
in
bed
with
a
pink
nose
and
eyes
overflowing
with
grief
and
influenza
i
nobly
offered
to
stay
with
her
but
dalziel
had
a
son
as
well
as
a
daughter
she
said
we
must
go
and
take
a
look
at
tony
tent
if
we
did
nothing
else
and
perhaps
it
would
have
ended
in
our
doing
not
much
more
if
it
had
been
for
eagle
el
paso
was
one
of
the
most
deliciously
exciting
places
in
america
just
then
and
there
were
many
things
which
i
wanted
far
more
to
see
than
tony
dalziel
tent
there
was
the
town
itself
with
its
broad
streets
and
tall
buildings
which
made
me
shiver
with
the
wildly
absurd
thought
of
their
being
smashed
by
silly
rebel
guns
from
across
the
river
its
shady
avenues
of
alluring
bungalows
and
its
parks
all
so
gay
and
peaceful
in
the
warm
spring
sunshine
that
the
very
suggestion
of
war
within
a
thousand
miles
seemed
fantastic
melodrama
despite
the
shouting
newspaper
boys
with
a
fearsome
extra
coming
out
every
fifteen
minutes
there
was
new
fort
bliss
the
cavalry
post
and
old
fort
bliss
famous
they
told
me
as
long
ago
as
the
days
of
indian
warfare
there
was
the
concentration
camp
where
five
thousand
mexicans
were
guarded
by
soldiers
and
there
were
the
camps
of
the
reinforcing
troops
artillery
cavalry
and
infantry
i
wanted
to
miss
nothing
but
when
we
had
motored
to
old
fort
bliss
down
by
the
river
and
the
smelting
works
and
seen
the
faded
houses
in
temporary
occupation
of
visiting
officers
when
we
had
spun
out
to
new
fort
bliss
to
admire
the
smart
quarters
and
barracks
and
when
we
had
trailed
about
a
little
in
tony
camp
dalziel
was
tired
the
sun
was
very
hot
and
she
thought
she
ought
to
go
home
to
poor
milly
captain
march
however
was
certain
that
what
i
ought
to
do
was
to
see
his
tent
before
deserting
camp
he
had
something
there
which
he
particularly
wished
to
show
me
tony
volunteered
to
take
his
mother
back
to
our
hired
automobile
waiting
near
the
zoo
and
to
return
for
me
i
hoped
that
he
might
be
away
a
long
time
and
looked
forward
to
my
few
minutes
alone
with
eagle
as
to
a
taste
of
paradise
having
no
idea
that
those
moments
would
be
long
enough
to
decide
the
fate
of
two
men
the
camp
was
a
neat
town
of
canvas
houses
big
and
little
seemingly
countless
rows
of
them
set
in
rough
grass
and
sandy
earth
of
the
same
yellow
brown
as
the
tents
how
the
officers
and
men
knew
their
narrow
lanes
and
dwellings
apart
i
could
not
imagine
for
they
all
bore
the
most
remarkable
family
resemblance
to
one
another
in
shape
and
feature
except
those
which
boasted
draperies
to
keep
out
the
flies
among
these
more
luxurious
soldier
houses
was
eagle
his
tent
prepared
for
the
day
consisted
of
a
canvas
wall
with
a
space
all
around
between
it
and
the
roof
and
the
whole
internal
economy
was
ingenuously
open
to
public
gaze
not
that
it
mattered
for
everything
was
as
neat
as
a
model
doll
house
the
narrow
bed
the
pathetically
meagre
toilet
arrangements
the
one
chair
the
small
trunk
which
was
the
sole
wardrobe
and
the
ridiculous
shaving
mirror
stuck
up
on
a
pole
above
a
miniature
arsenal
i
should
think
you
cut
yourself
to
pieces
said
i
giggling
impolitely
as
i
stood
on
tiptoe
and
peered
into
my
own
eyes
in
the
tiny
there
is
room
to
see
more
than
half
a
feature
at
a
time
i
always
been
glad
i
was
a
man
for
two
reasons
because
hate
to
have
to
shave
or
to
marry
a
woman
both
are
horrid
necessities
that
depends
on
the
razor
and
the
woman
laughed
eagle
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
value
that
square
of
glass
more
than
any
of
my
other
possessions
it
the
thing
i
expressly
wanted
to
show
you
stand
back
a
minute
lady
vanity
and
you
see
why
i
stood
back
eagle
did
something
to
the
plain
dark
frame
of
the
mirror
which
had
a
gold
rim
inside
then
he
pulled
out
the
glass
from
the
bottom
and
there
instead
framed
in
black
and
gold
was
a
photograph
of
diana
a
lovely
photograph
just
a
head
lips
faintly
smiling
eyes
gazing
straight
at
you
and
saying
in
plain
eye
language
i
love
you
dearly
i
had
never
seen
the
photograph
before
and
seeing
it
now
gave
me
a
strange
frightened
feeling
as
if
i
had
found
out
something
about
diana
which
i
was
supposed
to
know
it
was
such
an
portrait
intended
to
be
revealing
yet
really
concealing
i
felt
it
was
wicked
of
those
beautiful
eyes
to
say
what
they
did
not
mean
or
perhaps
did
not
know
how
to
mean
and
for
my
critical
stare
behind
that
i
love
you
calculation
hid
like
the
cold
glint
deep
down
in
the
jewel
eyes
of
a
persian
cat
when
she
does
want
a
mouse
to
guess
that
she
knows
it
is
there
now
you
can
understand
why
i
glad
to
be
a
man
said
eagle
in
spite
of
no
of
well
anyway
one
of
the
two
you
think
so
my
child
what
glory
to
be
chosen
out
of
all
the
rest
who
love
her
by
such
a
woman
and
i
hope
she
going
to
choose
me
i
do
believe
she
the
kind
of
girl
to
have
a
photograph
like
that
taken
expressly
for
a
man
if
she
did
feel
a
little
of
what
the
picture
seems
to
say
she
feels
do
you
i
suppose
men
ignorance
of
what
she
is
at
heart
is
a
suit
of
chain
armour
for
every
woman
but
i
was
myself
sure
enough
yet
of
what
di
might
decide
to
do
to
try
and
disturb
eagle
happy
confidence
in
her
so
instead
of
answering
his
questions
i
asked
him
one
she
have
that
photograph
taken
expressly
for
you
yes
eagle
answered
triumphantly
i
do
think
she
mind
my
repeating
to
her
own
sister
that
she
told
me
so
or
that
there
only
this
one
copy
and
she
gave
orders
to
have
the
negative
destroyed
he
had
hardly
got
these
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
we
heard
footsteps
and
major
vandyke
stopped
suddenly
in
front
of
the
doorway
in
an
instant
eagle
had
unhooked
the
frame
from
the
pole
and
holding
the
face
of
the
portrait
toward
his
breast
quietly
slipped
the
mirror
into
its
place
again
as
with
apparently
unruffled
he
called
out
hullo
vandyke
have
you
come
to
see
lady
peggy
or
me
i
did
know
lady
peggy
was
here
i
was
only
passing
by
on
my
way
to
the
colonel
explained
vandyke
but
seeing
her
i
thought
i
might
be
allowed
to
stop
and
say
do
you
do
he
spoke
rather
brusquely
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
his
tone
whether
it
covered
anger
or
expressed
only
the
coolness
which
had
grown
up
between
him
and
captain
march
as
i
shook
hands
with
major
vandyke
i
was
asking
myself
anxiously
if
he
could
have
seen
the
photograph
in
passing
if
not
and
it
did
seem
as
if
eagle
head
and
mine
ought
to
have
hidden
it
from
him
our
words
would
have
meant
nothing
to
his
intelligence
even
if
he
had
overheard
them
as
he
came
if
however
he
had
snatched
a
glimpse
of
diana
face
and
at
the
same
time
caught
what
eagle
said
i
was
afraid
there
might
be
trouble
provided
it
were
only
for
di
i
did
much
care
because
she
thoroughly
deserved
to
have
trouble
and
it
would
give
her
a
lesson
but
something
warned
my
instinct
that
the
consequences
might
spread
and
spread
until
others
suffered
as
a
ring
forever
widens
in
smooth
water
when
the
tiniest
pebble
is
thrown
chapter
viii
we
were
still
skirmishing
on
the
outskirts
of
conversation
what
did
i
think
of
a
soldier
quarters
why
had
any
one
yet
shown
me
the
great
sight
the
concentration
camp
when
tony
dalziel
came
hurrying
up
to
take
me
back
to
his
mother
and
the
motor
his
arrival
seemed
to
bring
relief
from
strain
it
was
like
a
brisk
breeze
blowing
away
the
brooding
clouds
that
stifle
the
atmosphere
before
a
thunderstorm
i
dreaded
to
go
and
leave
those
two
men
together
but
when
major
vandyke
suggested
walking
with
us
to
the
car
and
asking
dalziel
about
milly
my
heart
felt
lighter
we
stopped
only
long
enough
with
eagle
to
arrange
a
visit
to
the
concentration
camp
for
next
morning
if
milly
were
better
and
then
vandyke
tony
and
i
started
off
for
the
first
two
or
three
minutes
the
major
walked
along
in
silence
but
when
we
were
well
out
of
sight
of
eagle
march
tent
he
interrupted
some
sentence
of
tony
ruthlessly
i
do
think
he
was
even
aware
that
the
other
was
speaking
see
here
tony
old
man
will
you
do
me
a
favour
he
asked
in
his
nicest
manner
there
a
book
in
my
tent
i
promised
to
give
lady
peggy
to
read
aloud
to
miss
dalziel
a
jolly
good
story
i
forgot
to
bring
it
out
when
i
came
and
i
do
want
to
go
back
now
if
i
can
help
it
because
a
party
of
bores
are
being
shown
round
in
that
direction
awful
people
i
escaped
from
you
do
know
them
so
they
ca
hurt
you
will
you
like
a
dear
chap
cut
off
and
grab
the
book
it
on
the
table
you
ca
miss
it
purple
cover
tony
obligingly
cut
and
i
waited
breathless
for
what
was
to
come
knowing
now
without
being
told
that
sidney
vandyke
had
seen
the
photograph
he
had
not
promised
me
a
book
nor
mentioned
one
i
had
only
a
few
seconds
to
wait
is
it
true
that
your
sister
gave
march
the
picture
he
has
in
his
tent
he
demanded
rather
than
asked
i
gasped
doubtful
whether
it
would
be
wise
to
bring
things
to
a
crisis
or
better
to
try
and
keep
them
simmering
but
an
instant
reflection
told
me
that
to
with
the
man
in
this
mood
would
make
what
was
already
bad
far
worse
yes
she
gave
it
to
him
of
course
i
replied
i
think
you
must
have
overheard
him
say
so
i
really
did
mean
to
put
emphasis
on
the
offending
word
but
major
vandyke
suspected
it
perhaps
the
cap
fitted
i
was
eavesdropping
he
said
i
happened
to
hear
that
a
very
different
thing
from
overhearing
and
i
have
a
right
to
ask
you
as
diana
sister
diana
herself
not
being
on
the
spot
to
give
me
an
explanation
as
i
sure
she
would
if
she
were
here
because
i
have
the
duplicate
of
that
photo
she
told
me
she
had
it
taken
for
me
and
the
negative
destroyed
i
considered
it
sacred
i
would
have
shown
it
to
nobody
i
am
nobody
said
i
nobody
except
captain
march
friend
to
whom
he
tells
things
he
would
tell
to
others
he
had
the
best
of
reasons
to
believe
i
was
in
diana
confidence
as
well
as
his
and
as
for
the
photograph
it
as
sacred
to
him
as
it
could
be
to
you
major
vandyke
you
might
realize
that
from
the
clever
way
he
has
thought
of
to
hide
it
and
no
person
who
was
absolutely
could
have
recognized
it
in
passing
by
his
tent
he
knew
that
very
well
or
he
would
have
uncovered
the
picture
for
even
a
second
if
you
were
a
man
you
would
dare
say
such
a
thing
as
that
to
me
lady
peggy
oh
yes
i
would
i
retorted
if
i
were
nearly
as
big
as
you
captain
march
friend
not
yours
and
i
not
a
bit
afraid
to
be
your
enemy
if
you
are
his
you
are
more
loyal
to
your
friend
than
to
your
own
flesh
and
blood
he
flung
at
me
if
you
say
your
sister
did
give
that
photograph
to
march
you
make
her
out
a
liar
but
i
wo
believe
it
of
her
i
prefer
to
believe
it
of
march
instead
is
a
strong
word
i
temporized
i
was
always
taught
that
it
was
very
rude
too
you
a
flirt
major
vandyke
every
one
says
that
of
you
and
i
believe
you
proud
of
it
so
you
ought
to
have
some
sympathy
with
a
fellow
flirt
like
di
if
any
one
must
be
blamed
of
course
it
she
not
captain
march
he
has
as
much
right
to
accept
a
photograph
from
a
girl
as
you
have
but
you
need
be
too
angry
with
di
if
she
made
you
believe
that
you
were
the
only
one
when
she
was
doing
the
same
thing
with
captain
march
probably
she
did
to
either
of
you
in
so
many
words
it
not
necessary
for
you
to
defend
lady
diana
to
me
i
assure
you
returned
major
vandyke
whatever
she
may
have
done
i
ready
to
forgive
her
if
she
willing
to
stand
by
me
but
i
wo
have
march
swaggering
around
and
boasting
that
she
gives
him
special
favours
if
i
were
a
man
would
dare
say
i
burst
out
when
you
talk
about
or
you
must
be
judging
him
by
yourself
for
you
are
always
doing
both
he
never
i
believe
di
likes
him
better
than
she
does
you
because
he
a
sort
of
popular
hero
with
his
flying
and
you
have
nothing
except
your
flirting
and
your
fortune
to
recommend
you
to
a
girl
if
only
i
had
lost
my
head
and
thrown
that
taunt
at
him
i
suppose
i
shall
never
know
how
much
difference
or
how
little
this
mistake
of
mine
made
the
instant
the
words
were
out
i
would
have
given
anything
to
recall
them
but
it
was
too
late
to
apologize
or
try
to
explain
would
only
do
more
harm
i
ventured
one
sidelong
glance
at
major
face
after
i
had
shot
that
bolt
and
i
quivered
all
over
as
i
saw
how
the
blood
streamed
darkly
up
to
his
forehead
and
swelled
the
veins
at
his
temples
if
i
had
been
afraid
of
him
for
eagle
whose
superior
officer
he
was
i
might
have
pitied
him
for
the
pain
i
had
inflicted
under
which
he
could
keep
silence
only
by
biting
his
lip
i
knew
he
was
hating
me
violently
but
i
did
care
a
rap
all
i
cared
for
just
then
was
that
he
was
hating
eagle
march
and
counting
on
paying
him
out
in
some
way
i
could
guess
what
i
must
warn
eagle
i
said
to
myself
and
i
could
almost
have
kissed
tony
i
was
so
glad
to
see
him
when
he
came
back
with
the
book
which
nobody
wanted
major
vandyke
walked
on
with
us
to
the
motor
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
he
was
very
silent
letting
tony
and
me
talk
undisturbed
it
was
only
after
he
had
spoken
in
a
dry
mechanical
way
to
dalziel
and
the
car
was
about
to
start
that
i
caught
his
eyes
there
was
a
look
in
them
as
cold
and
deadly
or
i
imagined
it
as
deliberate
murder
i
could
wait
until
next
day
to
see
eagle
and
tell
him
i
hardly
knew
what
but
to
put
him
on
his
guard
he
had
said
that
he
was
engaged
to
lunch
with
a
man
named
donaldson
at
the
hotel
weldon
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
reach
him
there
by
telephone
at
a
little
before
one
i
called
up
the
hotel
and
inquired
if
captain
march
had
arrived
to
keep
an
appointment
with
donaldson
the
answer
was
yes
and
when
i
had
given
my
name
i
was
asked
to
hold
the
line
for
a
few
minutes
until
captain
march
should
come
to
the
telephone
as
i
sat
with
the
receiver
at
my
ear
waiting
somebody
began
to
talk
in
weird
spanish
or
mex
as
i
heard
it
nicknamed
in
el
paso
the
telephone
and
i
had
never
been
intimate
friends
at
home
and
practically
made
its
acquaintance
since
coming
to
america
so
i
scarcely
realized
why
or
how
i
was
hearing
that
voice
is
it
some
one
trying
to
call
to
me
i
wondered
stupidly
who
knows
here
except
eagle
that
i
speak
spanish
then
gradually
it
dawned
on
me
that
i
had
tapped
a
conversation
going
on
between
persons
with
whom
i
had
nothing
to
do
their
chatter
could
have
no
interest
for
me
even
if
it
were
excusable
to
listen
but
i
did
drop
the
receiver
lest
i
should
miss
captain
march
having
been
instructed
to
hold
the
line
till
he
came
i
help
being
vaguely
pleased
too
that
i
had
picked
up
enough
spanish
in
my
home
studies
to
understand
what
was
being
said
but
suddenly
my
silly
conceit
was
turned
into
horror
i
was
overhearing
that
word
which
major
vandyke
had
resented
a
plot
between
a
pair
of
mexican
servants
to
poison
the
american
families
who
employed
them
two
women
were
talking
to
each
other
rapidly
earnestly
in
tones
of
such
agitation
as
they
hurried
on
that
only
for
the
first
instant
could
i
fancy
a
practical
joke
was
being
played
you
got
the
stuff
safely
yes
then
it
has
gone
round
among
those
who
will
do
the
work
only
a
few
have
refused
to
come
in
those
who
eat
will
not
die
but
all
will
be
sick
then
the
men
can
not
fight
our
men
if
they
come
across
the
river
it
is
a
very
good
plan
to
let
us
women
help
in
our
way
yet
above
everything
there
must
be
no
mistake
it
is
for
the
noon
meal
on
thursday
but
only
if
we
are
sure
of
an
attack
for
that
night
we
should
be
lost
if
we
acted
too
soon
i
am
the
one
to
pass
the
word
i
am
telling
one
after
another
to
wait
until
it
comes
from
me
by
telephone
or
in
some
other
way
the
words
were
rattled
off
so
fast
that
i
could
catch
no
more
than
half
but
i
had
seized
enough
to
fill
up
the
spaces
for
myself
when
the
voices
were
cut
off
into
silence
and
eagle
march
called
hello
is
that
you
peggy
yes
i
said
i
had
something
important
to
say
to
you
but
i
heard
the
most
horrid
talk
going
on
over
the
telephone
i
afraid
it
may
mean
a
real
danger
for
el
paso
i
dare
tell
you
about
it
on
the
wire
do
let
me
see
you
i
must
can
you
possibly
take
a
taxi
and
rush
over
here
now
or
shall
i
go
to
you
i
do
that
if
you
ca
come
to
me
i
come
to
you
of
course
answered
eagle
i
excuse
myself
to
donaldson
and
be
with
you
in
five
minutes
good
in
the
hall
i
said
i
run
down
now
and
wait
for
you
dalziel
and
i
were
to
lunch
in
milly
room
to
keep
her
company
and
tell
her
all
the
news
but
the
meal
was
due
yet
for
half
an
hour
so
there
was
plenty
of
time
before
my
hostess
should
come
knocking
at
the
door
i
had
just
found
a
quiet
place
in
the
corner
of
the
big
marble
hall
and
annexed
a
sofa
for
two
when
i
saw
eagle
walk
in
he
was
looking
for
me
i
beckoned
and
he
came
to
me
with
long
strides
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
why
but
never
had
i
loved
him
so
well
as
at
that
moment
i
did
not
see
how
i
was
going
to
bear
a
whole
long
life
without
having
him
in
it
when
he
had
sat
down
by
my
side
i
told
him
quickly
what
i
had
overheard
and
how
the
moment
he
had
got
the
pith
of
the
story
he
jumped
up
looking
preoccupied
and
anxious
i
must
go
at
once
he
said
before
the
girls
at
the
telephone
exchange
have
time
to
forget
the
numbers
of
those
who
called
and
been
called
up
in
the
last
twenty
minutes
or
so
we
may
be
able
to
catch
the
ringleader
in
that
way
and
get
from
her
the
names
of
every
one
in
the
plot
if
it
a
genuine
plot
and
i
agree
with
you
that
it
looks
rather
like
it
peggy
your
fad
for
studying
languages
and
your
quick
wits
may
have
saved
el
paso
from
something
at
the
least
unpleasant
oh
i
hope
so
i
cried
and
the
women
talked
about
some
do
forget
that
no
fear
he
almost
laughed
now
i
must
go
you
may
be
asked
some
questions
later
on
i
hope
you
wo
much
mind
i
shook
my
head
what
does
it
matter
but
oh
eagle
i
can
not
let
you
go
until
i
told
you
what
i
rang
you
up
for
major
vandyke
saw
picture
and
heard
what
we
said
and
he
furious
because
it
seems
she
gave
him
a
photograph
something
like
yours
i
do
quite
know
what
he
thinks
but
he
more
angry
with
you
than
with
her
and
i
believe
try
to
get
even
with
you
in
someway
look
out
for
him
i
will
this
time
he
laughed
outright
and
i
do
think
he
will
be
able
to
frighten
me
into
giving
up
diana
if
she
have
me
dear
and
thank
you
for
everything
with
all
my
heart
you
my
good
angel
how
i
wish
i
could
be
i
sighed
but
he
heard
neither
sigh
nor
words
he
had
hurried
away
and
into
his
waiting
taxi
chapter
ix
unluckily
nothing
could
be
proved
through
the
telephone
people
though
there
was
certain
circumstantial
evidence
against
one
or
two
mexican
women
as
i
heard
through
eagle
march
but
american
families
who
employed
mexicans
were
privately
informed
of
the
existence
of
a
possible
plot
against
them
and
consequently
a
number
of
mexican
servants
in
el
paso
were
thrown
out
of
employment
at
an
hour
notice
the
authorities
did
all
they
could
to
keep
any
report
out
of
the
papers
but
of
course
did
not
succeed
and
the
extras
had
choice
of
sensation
for
that
afternoon
the
mysterious
threat
of
an
impending
raid
was
enlarged
upon
too
and
to
calm
the
public
as
well
as
impress
the
other
side
of
the
river
it
was
decided
to
have
a
great
parade
of
troops
through
the
town
a
day
was
settled
upon
to
be
called
army
day
but
meanwhile
precautions
were
taken
to
guard
against
any
surprise
coup
such
as
had
been
carried
out
across
the
rio
grande
at
juarez
by
a
few
constitutionalists
against
federals
one
night
some
months
before
the
crowds
who
had
been
out
to
stare
at
the
concentration
camp
peopled
with
thousands
of
men
women
and
children
trailed
in
procession
as
near
as
they
were
allowed
to
approach
the
field
guns
placed
on
a
bare
brown
eminence
whence
their
long
noses
pointed
grimly
across
the
river
there
were
six
of
these
guns
the
day
i
saw
them
all
guns
of
captain
march
battery
but
owing
to
their
alignment
and
the
position
of
el
paso
few
skyscrapers
between
this
hill
and
the
river
only
four
of
the
guns
would
threaten
destruction
to
any
buildings
in
the
town
in
case
the
artillery
had
to
be
brought
into
action
the
other
two
could
be
fired
in
the
unlikely
event
of
a
disturbance
it
was
believed
without
danger
to
american
property
i
heard
this
with
lots
of
other
exciting
details
of
the
preparations
going
on
from
tony
dalziel
who
thought
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
that
he
could
chat
to
me
on
the
one
great
subject
of
interest
without
indiscretion
he
told
me
among
other
things
that
if
fire
had
to
be
opened
on
juarez
just
across
the
river
he
understood
from
talk
he
heard
that
these
two
comparatively
innocuous
guns
would
alone
be
used
at
first
if
the
damage
they
did
on
the
opposite
side
were
enough
to
force
the
enemy
to
capitulate
in
haste
the
other
four
guns
would
remain
silent
and
el
paso
intact
but
said
tony
and
his
fellow
officers
said
the
same
in
spite
of
the
persistent
rumour
of
a
raid
it
was
almost
certain
now
that
there
would
be
no
trouble
it
was
whispered
that
because
americans
had
given
sanctuary
to
federal
troops
in
flight
and
for
other
reasons
not
so
widely
known
general
carranza
had
wanted
to
organize
an
attack
on
the
united
states
frontier
across
the
rio
grande
temptingly
shrunken
by
a
long
drought
but
it
was
reported
at
the
same
time
that
general
villa
had
forcibly
opposed
the
suggestion
and
it
was
very
improbable
that
any
serious
attempt
would
be
made
to
carry
it
out
it
was
tuesday
when
i
gave
the
alarm
of
the
poison
plot
and
thursday
was
the
day
gossip
suggested
for
a
raid
nevertheless
the
people
were
no
longer
nervous
they
felt
a
joyful
confidence
in
the
troops
who
had
been
sent
to
reinforce
the
garrison
at
fort
bliss
and
even
the
most
bloodcurdling
newspaper
headlines
had
at
length
lost
much
of
their
gruesomeness
by
this
time
milly
dalziel
was
as
well
as
ever
once
more
and
using
her
regained
health
to
make
a
dead
set
at
eagle
march
i
should
tell
this
of
her
if
what
she
did
later
had
influenced
events
in
a
strange
dramatic
way
she
could
let
eagle
alone
and
she
showed
her
feelings
so
plainly
as
a
very
rich
girl
sometimes
thinks
she
may
do
with
a
comparatively
poor
man
that
even
eagle
himself
despite
his
lack
of
and
his
preoccupation
with
thoughts
of
di
could
help
understanding
he
kept
out
of
milly
way
as
often
as
he
could
but
she
attributed
this
retirement
to
the
calls
of
duty
and
at
last
began
to
behave
so
foolishly
that
for
her
own
sake
he
gently
snubbed
her
poor
milly
dalziel
had
not
her
pretty
bright
red
hair
for
nothing
her
impulsive
emotions
which
she
concealed
badly
and
her
fiery
temper
were
its
natural
accompaniments
when
it
burst
upon
her
that
eagle
march
did
not
admire
her
as
she
admired
him
and
thought
it
best
she
should
realize
this
once
for
all
she
suffered
a
wild
reaction
of
feeling
from
being
slavishly
ridiculously
in
love
she
flew
to
the
other
extreme
and
after
an
embarrassing
little
scene
in
which
eagle
firmly
avoided
her
she
broke
out
to
me
in
hysterical
abuse
of
him
he
was
rude
he
was
no
gentleman
and
she
did
see
how
i
could
make
a
friend
of
such
an
ungracious
brute
the
one
thing
he
could
do
was
to
fly
and
she
only
wished
he
fly
far
away
and
never
be
seen
again
i
was
too
sorry
for
the
girl
to
resent
as
i
ought
to
have
resented
her
childish
but
mean
abuse
i
knew
only
too
well
how
much
it
hurt
to
be
in
love
with
eagle
march
and
not
to
have
him
care
an
american
red
cent
in
return
i
let
milly
talk
for
a
while
and
then
tried
to
soothe
her
down
saying
that
she
would
feel
differently
about
everything
next
day
this
was
the
signal
for
the
girl
to
turn
on
me
which
she
did
so
ferociously
that
i
began
to
fear
i
must
find
an
excuse
to
cut
my
visit
short
i
wanted
to
stay
i
had
very
little
money
for
travelling
and
i
was
sure
father
would
send
funds
with
reluctance
especially
as
he
no
doubt
hoped
that
tony
and
i
would
after
all
come
together
with
di
and
me
both
safely
disposed
of
to
rich
husbands
he
would
be
free
to
marry
kitty
main
or
do
anything
he
pleased
with
this
thought
in
my
mind
the
situation
looked
rather
desperate
and
that
night
thursday
night
i
was
lying
awake
to
wonder
what
i
could
do
when
suddenly
the
night
silence
which
falls
on
lively
el
paso
after
twelve
was
broken
with
the
noise
of
a
tremendous
explosion
the
huge
bulk
of
the
hotel
quivered
as
if
struck
with
a
titan
hammer
and
it
must
have
been
the
same
with
every
other
building
in
town
i
jumped
out
of
bed
mechanically
not
knowing
what
i
did
only
my
body
acted
for
an
instant
my
brain
was
dazed
connection
cut
off
the
first
thing
i
really
knew
i
found
myself
standing
at
the
open
window
clinging
to
the
curtains
what
is
it
what
is
it
i
was
stammering
out
aloud
and
before
i
could
get
any
answer
from
within
again
came
the
same
appalling
sound
with
that
as
if
a
second
shock
could
restore
the
senses
stolen
by
the
one
preceding
i
guessed
that
what
i
had
heard
must
be
gunfiring
on
the
hill
the
raid
has
come
then
after
all
i
thought
with
awe
rather
than
fear
and
thousands
of
other
people
must
have
been
thinking
the
same
thought
at
the
same
moment
it
was
a
clear
starry
night
the
sky
glittering
like
a
blue
spangled
robe
that
scintillates
with
the
motion
of
a
dancer
and
the
electric
lamps
of
the
city
below
lighting
the
streets
as
brightly
as
if
the
moon
were
up
when
i
first
reached
the
high
window
and
stared
down
from
it
i
had
the
impression
that
those
streets
were
empty
but
immediately
after
the
second
shot
and
its
reverberating
echo
dark
figures
began
swarming
out
heads
appeared
in
every
visible
window
of
the
hotel
electricity
was
switched
on
in
darkened
rooms
and
women
showed
themselves
in
their
nightgowns
with
hair
streaming
over
their
shoulders
or
hair
lamentably
absent
careless
whether
they
were
seen
or
not
i
heard
screaming
and
shouting
and
then
all
such
small
sounds
were
swallowed
up
in
another
roar
the
third
my
thoughts
flew
to
eagle
if
there
were
a
raid
he
would
be
in
danger
he
might
be
killed
and
i
should
never
see
him
again
i
did
think
at
the
minute
what
might
happen
to
the
rest
of
us
nothing
and
no
one
seemed
to
matter
except
eagle
still
only
half
conscious
of
what
i
did
unable
to
decide
what
might
be
best
to
do
i
dropped
on
my
knees
to
pray
that
eagle
might
be
safe
but
i
had
only
just
begun
to
stammer
out
my
appeal
when
there
came
a
sharp
tapping
at
the
door
let
us
in
let
us
in
milly
voice
cried
and
dalziel
quaveringly
repeated
the
same
words
i
shot
back
the
bolt
and
the
two
in
their
nightgowns
almost
fell
into
the
room
milly
crying
seized
me
in
her
arms
and
begged
me
to
forgive
her
for
all
her
unkindness
to
me
we
should
probably
be
dead
in
a
few
minutes
or
hours
and
she
wanted
to
die
at
peace
as
she
faltered
on
dalziel
sobbed
that
tony
would
be
killed
and
their
fears
made
me
brave
i
was
suddenly
convinced
that
there
had
been
no
raid
and
said
so
i
sure
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
i
insisted
stoically
remember
we
heard
only
three
cannon
shots
or
sounds
like
shots
there
be
constant
firing
if
there
had
been
a
mexican
surprise
and
there
have
been
a
after
all
the
warnings
we
had
anyhow
a
handful
of
mexicans
would
dare
with
all
those
troops
and
guns
on
the
spot
but
what
can
have
happened
if
it
is
an
attack
wailed
dalziel
if
only
my
son
were
here
did
the
shots
come
from
our
side
of
the
river
or
the
other
milly
asked
speaking
more
to
herself
than
to
me
for
one
was
as
ignorant
on
the
subject
as
the
other
could
tell
for
sure
could
you
no
i
said
i
had
thought
of
the
other
side
i
just
took
it
for
granted
it
was
our
own
guns
firing
for
some
reason
or
other
but
reason
persisted
milly
why
should
they
fire
three
shots
in
the
dead
of
the
night
and
then
stop
perhaps
it
maneuvers
or
a
firing
drill
or
something
i
hazarded
weakly
feeling
all
the
time
that
it
was
nothing
of
the
sort
perhaps
dalziel
and
milly
both
agreed
looking
a
little
relieved
by
my
silly
supposition
shall
we
hurry
up
and
dress
ourselves
and
go
downstairs
i
suggested
see
what
a
lot
of
people
are
in
the
streets
the
whole
town
surprised
out
of
its
wits
and
wild
to
know
what
happened
why
should
we
know
too
oh
yes
let
go
down
cried
milly
by
this
time
thérèse
is
certain
to
be
in
mother
room
in
hysterics
and
nothing
else
we
make
her
stop
and
drape
herself
in
a
blanket
and
dress
us
thank
goodness
i
can
dress
myself
and
in
five
minutes
i
said
they
went
hesitatingly
out
forgetting
to
close
my
door
and
before
i
could
do
so
myself
i
heard
thérèse
voice
across
the
hall
i
did
stop
to
put
up
my
hair
but
let
it
hang
down
my
back
i
even
tie
my
shoes
or
fasten
more
than
three
hooks
of
my
easiest
blouse
one
at
the
top
one
in
the
middle
and
one
at
the
waist
consequently
i
was
ready
before
the
dalziels
but
waited
for
them
outside
the
door
of
their
suite
almost
dazedly
watching
people
men
and
women
half
clothed
dashing
out
of
their
rooms
toward
the
stairs
and
elevators
some
of
these
were
jabbering
to
each
other
but
nobody
seemed
to
know
what
had
happened
they
were
merely
wondering
as
we
were
and
in
the
big
hall
where
some
of
the
lights
had
been
switched
on
we
could
glean
no
further
details
several
of
the
hotel
employés
had
arrived
on
the
scene
more
or
less
dressed
and
they
did
what
they
could
to
calm
their
guests
presently
one
of
the
managers
appeared
and
he
strongly
advised
every
one
to
remain
in
the
hotel
if
any
trouble
were
afoot
it
would
be
safer
indoors
than
out
and
news
might
be
expected
soon
he
had
already
sent
a
trustworthy
messenger
he
explained
to
inquire
of
the
police
and
the
answer
would
be
more
reliable
than
mere
wild
gossip
picked
up
in
the
street
among
the
crowd
some
of
the
older
men
and
all
the
women
took
the
manager
advice
though
a
good
many
young
men
disregarded
it
and
went
off
foraging
for
news
those
of
us
who
remained
in
the
house
however
did
think
of
meekly
returning
to
our
rooms
we
herded
together
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
in
a
fever
of
expectation
strangers
hobnobbing
like
old
acquaintances
and
exchanging
opinions
on
the
mysterious
alarm
the
time
of
waiting
seemed
long
but
we
three
had
not
been
below
more
than
twenty
minutes
perhaps
when
people
who
had
been
out
began
to
stream
back
with
tidings
of
a
sort
for
their
families
no
two
men
had
quite
the
same
story
to
tell
one
had
heard
that
a
band
of
from
a
low
quarter
of
the
town
had
organized
a
scare
to
stir
up
the
military
another
had
been
told
on
good
authority
that
the
mexicans
had
fired
guns
from
across
the
river
and
injured
one
of
the
tall
buildings
in
el
paso
nobody
knew
which
a
third
assured
everybody
that
our
guns
had
been
fired
but
charged
only
with
blank
to
frighten
the
mexicans
at
the
moment
when
they
hoped
to
give
us
a
surprise
by
and
by
the
messenger
dispatched
by
the
manager
came
back
but
he
had
little
new
light
to
throw
on
the
situation
except
to
assure
every
one
on
the
authority
of
the
police
that
there
had
been
no
raid
and
there
was
no
danger
of
any
kind
for
the
town
accordingly
the
best
thing
for
its
inhabitants
to
do
would
be
to
go
to
bed
again
very
few
however
seemed
inclined
to
take
this
advice
dalziel
might
have
done
so
had
milly
and
i
consented
but
i
had
an
idea
that
tony
would
come
to
the
hotel
if
possible
sooner
or
later
expecting
us
to
be
anxious
i
was
right
for
in
an
hour
or
not
much
more
while
we
all
sat
munching
sandwiches
hastily
provided
the
familiar
plump
figure
in
khaki
stalked
into
the
hall
milly
and
i
both
sprang
up
and
tony
directed
himself
toward
us
but
before
he
came
near
enough
to
speak
i
knew
that
something
really
terrible
had
happened
whether
he
meant
to
tell
us
the
truth
or
not
was
another
question
the
jolly
boy
seemed
to
have
lost
the
characteristics
i
associated
most
closely
with
him
and
when
a
a
youth
with
comical
features
of
the
billiken
type
is
suddenly
fitted
with
a
tragic
mask
the
effect
is
somehow
more
alarming
than
any
look
of
distress
on
a
serious
face
he
tried
to
grin
as
his
mother
greeted
him
like
one
returning
from
the
dead
why
mater
he
said
any
one
think
to
see
and
hear
you
that
i
been
blown
to
smithereens
and
this
was
my
ghost
you
laugh
i
guess
when
i
tell
you
what
really
happened
i
got
leave
to
make
a
dash
and
put
you
out
of
your
misery
when
he
had
gone
so
far
he
stopped
and
swallowed
he
looked
sick
and
all
the
more
so
because
of
the
billiken
grin
which
he
was
afraid
to
let
drop
his
eyes
wandered
from
his
mother
to
me
and
i
saw
pain
in
them
i
felt
for
the
first
time
that
little
tony
was
a
man
well
well
milly
urged
him
sharply
why
do
you
tell
us
i
a
bit
out
of
breath
her
brother
excused
himself
i
hiked
over
here
pretty
fast
borrowed
a
bicycle
give
me
a
second
to
get
my
wind
back
sis
but
this
was
more
than
milly
could
do
were
you
with
the
guns
she
asked
you
said
you
were
going
to
be
did
i
say
that
well
i
was
but
but
the
row
you
all
heard
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
you
know
at
least
nothing
directly
it
was
the
ammunition
an
accident
you
see
one
of
our
chaps
dropped
a
lighted
match
and
it
set
fire
to
part
of
our
train
of
ammunition
three
shells
burst
but
but
nobody
was
hurt
except
except
who
milly
had
to
break
in
before
tony
could
go
on
i
said
nothing
at
all
i
only
looked
at
him
but
after
that
first
glance
he
kept
his
eyes
away
from
me
i
believed
purposely
except
an
orderly
of
one
of
the
officers
and
oh
very
slightly
indeed
march
he
hardly
hurt
at
all
but
you
must
be
surprised
if
you
do
see
him
around
for
the
next
few
days
the
blood
rushed
up
to
milly
pale
face
but
she
pressed
her
lips
together
almost
viciously
and
forced
herself
not
to
speak
her
eyes
flashed
out
one
distress
signal
then
seemed
to
shut
it
off
deliberately
and
coldly
captain
march
exclaimed
kind
dalziel
with
real
distress
oh
i
so
sorry
that
he
should
be
hurt
so
are
we
all
tony
responded
and
voice
and
face
would
have
told
me
if
i
had
guessed
before
that
he
was
either
keeping
back
something
of
grave
importance
or
else
carefully
lying
will
he
really
be
all
right
again
in
a
few
days
the
dear
little
lady
went
on
er
perhaps
not
all
right
but
nothing
to
worry
about
said
tony
with
lumbering
cheerfulness
he
in
no
danger
of
death
anyhow
one
good
thing
what
about
major
vandyke
i
heard
myself
say
and
even
as
the
question
came
i
wondered
why
i
should
have
thought
of
it
in
that
connection
but
somehow
it
would
out
and
only
my
subconscious
self
far
down
in
mysterious
depths
knew
the
reason
oh
major
vandyke
why
as
it
happens
he
went
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
his
motor
car
on
business
a
flame
of
suspicion
in
me
was
lit
by
that
match
to
i
exclaimed
but
i
was
told
only
this
very
day
by
captain
march
that
no
officer
or
soldier
was
allowed
to
cross
the
river
on
any
pretext
whatever
that
was
is
so
in
an
ordinary
way
tony
admitted
swallowing
heavily
again
but
you
see
that
fearful
row
on
the
hill
where
the
guns
are
might
must
have
set
a
hornet
nest
buzzing
over
there
the
chaps
were
likely
to
think
we
were
potting
at
out
of
a
clear
sky
and
er
they
might
have
begun
potting
back
at
us
in
a
minute
or
two
in
their
excitement
so
to
save
the
situation
vandyke
scooted
across
with
only
his
orderly
who
his
chauffeur
too
in
his
own
car
with
some
sort
of
white
flag
rigged
up
in
a
jiffy
i
expect
he
get
a
lot
of
credit
for
that
dash
when
the
story
i
mean
the
facts
are
out
it
a
brave
thing
to
do
cried
dalziel
always
delighted
to
praise
any
one
he
must
have
risked
his
life
yes
said
tony
no
doubt
of
that
the
mexican
bridge
sentries
might
have
fired
on
him
in
spite
of
the
white
flag
they
they
did
fire
i
believe
but
vandyke
all
right
anyhow
you
speak
as
if
some
one
was
i
heard
myself
talking
though
i
seemed
not
to
have
spoken
the
words
deliberately
only
the
orderly
poor
chap
he
was
driving
the
car
i
guess
the
sentries
saw
him
before
they
saw
the
white
flag
they
shot
him
yes
unfortunately
they
did
tony
voice
broke
a
little
and
that
struck
me
as
odd
for
he
could
not
have
had
any
personal
interest
it
seemed
in
major
vandyke
i
hope
they
did
kill
the
poor
fellow
purred
dalziel
i
do
think
he
dead
yet
mater
but
i
afraid
he
past
speaking
they
got
him
in
the
lungs
major
vandyke
come
back
then
i
said
oh
yes
he
was
back
in
less
than
an
hour
after
a
parley
over
there
explaining
everything
and
making
the
constitutionalists
understand
we
were
meaning
them
any
harm
i
did
get
leave
to
see
you
till
just
after
he
had
brought
his
car
and
his
wounded
orderly
over
to
this
side
again
and
now
if
your
minds
are
calmed
down
i
be
off
i
told
you
no
secrets
everything
i
said
the
papers
will
repeat
but
all
the
same
please
do
talk
to
any
one
about
this
business
promise
mater
and
milly
and
i
guess
i
do
need
to
ask
you
lady
peggy
now
i
see
you
as
early
as
i
can
in
the
morning
he
kissed
his
mother
patted
milly
on
the
arm
and
gave
my
hand
such
a
shake
that
i
should
have
writhed
if
i
had
worn
any
rings
for
once
instead
of
lingering
he
had
the
air
of
being
glad
to
escape
from
us
but
on
an
impulse
i
followed
him
to
the
door
and
called
him
back
just
as
he
had
reached
the
threshold
tony
i
began
he
turned
with
a
start
and
stopped
i
had
often
been
invited
but
had
never
before
consented
to
call
him
tony
i
want
to
ask
you
something
before
you
go
i
said
he
gave
me
a
queer
apprehensive
look
please
do
then
i
tell
you
something
instead
there
is
one
word
of
truth
in
your
story
about
what
happened
you
been
making
it
all
up
that
where
you
mistaken
he
contradicted
me
i
have
made
it
up
if
not
somebody
made
it
up
for
you
and
you
been
ordered
to
put
the
story
round
this
is
what
people
are
to
believe
the
version
that
the
papers
will
be
given
but
it
no
use
giving
it
to
me
i
do
believe
it
so
there
it
all
i
got
to
say
and
even
you
wo
get
a
different
word
out
of
me
he
said
despairingly
you
always
did
have
a
wonderful
imagination
lady
peggy
but
whatever
you
may
think
for
god
sake
do
blab
to
any
one
else
unless
to
me
and
i
rather
you
even
to
me
i
tell
you
i
pretty
near
all
in
i
let
him
go
but
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
not
be
put
off
with
the
story
which
papers
and
public
were
to
get
i
would
know
the
truth
and
exactly
what
had
happened
to
eagle
march
chapter
x
it
was
just
as
tony
had
said
it
would
be
the
newspapers
next
day
repeated
his
story
very
few
clear
details
were
given
the
articles
with
their
headlines
concerned
themselves
more
for
a
wonder
with
effect
than
cause
they
told
at
length
and
dramatically
how
el
paso
had
been
aroused
in
the
dead
of
night
by
bomblike
explosions
which
many
had
taken
for
granted
came
from
the
guns
on
the
hill
repelling
or
revenging
a
raid
from
the
other
side
they
told
how
the
public
had
behaved
and
described
the
relief
felt
when
it
had
been
definitely
learned
on
good
authority
that
the
alarm
was
due
to
an
accident
with
some
ammunition
but
about
the
accident
itself
there
was
what
struck
me
as
a
singular
reticence
considering
the
wild
conjectures
newspapers
did
not
hesitate
to
print
on
other
subjects
their
de
was
the
magnificent
courage
and
presence
of
mind
displayed
by
major
sidney
vandyke
of
the
th
artillery
whose
battery
had
been
concerned
in
the
incident
i
sent
for
all
the
el
paso
papers
which
were
brought
to
me
before
i
was
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
i
sat
in
bed
studying
in
one
after
the
other
of
them
the
version
of
last
night
strange
affair
somehow
the
general
praise
of
sidney
vandyke
exploit
annoyed
me
intensely
as
one
is
annoyed
when
an
undeserving
person
is
ignorantly
lauded
to
the
skies
i
know
that
on
the
face
of
things
i
had
no
right
to
say
that
he
was
undeserving
in
this
case
but
that
instinctive
rebellion
in
me
against
tony
story
last
night
cried
out
against
it
now
something
queer
under
it
all
i
kept
telling
myself
i
must
find
out
what
it
is
and
i
know
about
eagle
concerning
captain
march
the
papers
had
very
little
to
say
they
understood
that
he
had
been
on
the
spot
when
the
explosion
had
occurred
and
that
he
had
received
slight
injuries
which
would
prevent
him
from
carrying
on
his
military
duties
for
some
time
to
come
all
their
attention
was
bestowed
upon
major
vandyke
who
had
made
himself
the
hero
of
what
was
called
el
paso
big
night
owing
to
the
indisposition
of
the
colonel
who
had
been
struck
down
in
the
morning
by
a
touch
of
the
sun
major
vandyke
was
temporarily
in
command
his
private
automobile
which
had
followed
him
from
alvarado
to
el
paso
had
brought
him
from
new
fort
bliss
to
old
fort
bliss
on
official
business
and
he
was
on
his
way
back
when
hearing
sounds
which
resembled
gunfire
he
had
stopped
his
chauffeur
on
the
instant
and
dashed
on
fast
up
the
artillery
hill
near
which
he
happened
to
be
fearing
that
the
mexicans
already
restless
owing
to
the
attitude
of
the
united
states
at
vera
cruz
and
other
places
and
to
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
along
the
rio
grande
might
misunderstand
and
work
some
mad
irreparable
mischief
major
vandyke
and
his
orderly
had
made
a
dash
across
the
river
in
spite
of
the
white
flag
used
to
protect
the
car
and
its
occupants
the
sentinels
on
guard
upon
the
mexican
side
had
fired
at
the
sight
of
men
in
uniform
and
the
orderly
had
been
shot
otherwise
the
errand
so
bravely
undertaken
had
been
crowned
with
success
the
mexicans
thinking
they
had
been
fired
at
were
about
to
discharge
their
own
field
guns
placed
in
a
position
of
offence
in
answer
to
the
menace
of
the
united
states
had
major
vandyke
been
five
minutes
later
with
his
diplomatic
intervention
the
word
would
have
been
given
to
fire
and
one
or
more
of
el
paso
finest
buildings
might
have
been
destroyed
perhaps
with
loss
of
life
terrible
to
think
of
even
now
when
the
danger
was
past
the
next
thing
i
did
having
absorbed
all
the
news
i
could
get
from
the
papers
was
to
write
a
letter
to
eagle
i
told
him
that
i
heard
he
had
been
hurt
and
begged
him
to
send
me
a
line
or
a
word
if
he
write
to
say
how
he
really
was
i
inquired
if
he
were
in
hospital
and
if
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
see
him
when
i
had
finished
i
rang
and
asked
for
a
trustworthy
messenger
by
and
by
a
servant
of
the
hotel
arrived
to
do
my
errand
and
i
told
him
as
clearly
as
i
could
what
i
wanted
he
must
go
to
the
big
camp
near
fort
bliss
and
inquire
for
captain
march
i
could
say
whether
the
officer
would
be
in
his
own
tent
or
elsewhere
but
anyhow
he
must
be
found
if
he
were
too
ill
to
answer
even
by
word
of
mouth
the
messenger
must
come
back
until
at
least
he
had
learned
something
about
captain
march
condition
i
pay
you
very
well
i
said
trying
to
give
the
effect
of
a
budding
female
millionaire
as
soon
as
the
man
had
gone
i
bathed
and
dressed
quickly
in
order
to
be
ready
if
he
brought
back
word
that
i
might
be
allowed
to
see
eagle
i
did
care
whether
i
had
breakfast
or
not
but
time
dragged
on
and
nothing
happened
for
the
sake
of
making
dull
moments
pass
i
rang
for
coffee
and
a
roll
it
was
early
still
and
dalziel
and
milly
were
doubtless
trying
to
make
up
for
their
disturbed
night
by
taking
an
extra
rest
the
tray
appeared
and
i
ate
and
drank
what
the
choking
in
my
throat
would
let
me
swallow
but
there
was
no
sign
yet
of
the
messenger
i
calculated
how
long
it
ought
to
take
him
to
reach
the
camp
on
the
bicycle
he
had
mentioned
how
long
to
do
the
errand
how
long
to
return
and
still
there
was
nearly
an
hour
unaccounted
for
i
was
so
restless
and
miserable
that
i
could
have
shrieked
i
walked
up
and
down
the
little
room
as
if
it
were
a
cage
but
soon
all
my
strength
had
gone
from
me
i
sat
on
the
window
seat
staring
out
as
i
had
stared
in
the
night
hoping
now
to
catch
sight
of
a
man
on
a
bicycle
at
last
when
i
had
begun
to
feel
shut
in
and
only
half
alive
like
the
lady
of
shalott
as
though
nothing
could
ever
happen
in
my
life
again
i
jumped
up
at
the
sound
of
a
knock
on
the
door
it
was
the
messenger
my
heart
bounded
when
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
letter
but
only
to
fall
at
seeing
a
hotel
envelope
with
my
own
handwriting
on
it
i
sorry
miss
the
man
said
but
i
could
get
to
captain
march
i
went
everywhere
and
tried
asking
a
lot
of
folks
but
could
find
out
nothing
they
would
let
me
into
the
camp
even
much
less
to
the
gentleman
tent
so
i
ca
tell
you
whether
he
there
or
not
i
did
my
best
but
the
army
different
from
civil
life
when
they
say
they
mean
and
there
ai
no
goin
around
it
or
they
prods
you
with
one
of
them
bayonets
surely
you
have
come
back
without
any
news
i
cried
you
must
have
heard
not
a
thing
at
the
camp
except
what
i
just
told
you
miss
the
messenger
persisted
i
hung
around
and
whenever
i
seen
some
chap
going
in
if
i
could
get
him
to
speak
i
asked
questions
till
they
begun
to
take
me
for
one
of
them
newspaper
guys
it
was
only
when
i
seen
the
stunt
was
no
good
i
chucked
it
and
come
back
with
your
letter
just
one
thing
i
did
hear
but
not
in
camp
was
outside
the
hotel
as
i
stopped
my
wheel
i
met
an
old
soldier
from
the
fort
i
been
acquainted
with
a
good
long
time
fact
is
he
engaged
to
my
sister
i
asked
him
if
he
heard
about
captain
march
being
wounded
and
he
said
only
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
tell
you
what
he
said
tell
me
every
word
i
panted
well
then
if
it
word
you
want
miss
he
said
it
was
all
damn
nonsense
about
march
being
wounded
that
something
big
was
up
and
he
under
arrest
under
arrest
the
words
struck
like
bullets
just
for
a
second
everything
swam
before
my
eyes
and
i
was
afraid
that
i
was
going
to
do
the
most
idiotic
thing
a
woman
can
do
faint
you
see
i
had
had
no
sleep
and
was
quite
at
my
best
but
i
pulled
myself
together
and
in
my
ears
my
voice
sounded
only
a
little
sharp
as
i
asked
the
messenger
if
his
soldier
friend
had
given
him
any
further
information
not
he
shut
up
tight
as
a
clam
was
the
answer
i
do
believe
he
knowed
anything
else
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
got
from
that
quarter
so
i
paid
the
man
and
let
him
go
then
i
tried
to
think
how
i
could
hope
to
probe
to
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
since
mystery
there
certainly
was
it
seemed
to
me
that
since
i
was
able
to
reach
eagle
by
letter
my
one
chance
lay
in
tony
his
manner
and
the
admissions
he
had
inadvertently
dropped
last
night
had
told
me
that
he
had
some
knowledge
of
the
truth
which
was
to
be
hidden
from
the
public
he
had
refused
to
be
pumped
and
i
respected
him
for
his
refusal
but
i
was
the
public
whatever
the
secret
might
be
i
would
keep
it
all
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
help
captain
march
if
he
could
be
helped
for
i
was
sure
all
through
to
my
soul
that
if
he
had
been
arrested
it
was
through
some
terrible
mistake
or
cruel
injustice
it
was
wicked
of
me
perhaps
deliberately
to
make
a
tool
of
poor
tony
love
for
me
but
i
tried
to
justify
myself
in
deciding
to
do
so
by
saying
that
no
harm
could
come
to
him
through
it
or
evil
to
any
one
i
wheedle
the
truth
out
of
tony
i
thought
again
i
dared
not
write
and
beg
him
to
come
and
see
me
for
after
our
parting
last
night
he
would
suspect
what
i
wanted
and
have
time
to
steel
himself
against
me
before
we
met
nor
could
i
go
to
the
camp
and
try
to
find
him
there
for
i
a
young
girl
would
be
admitted
alone
even
if
i
were
desperate
enough
to
think
of
attempting
such
a
wild
adventure
if
i
persuaded
dalziel
to
take
me
and
we
had
the
luck
to
see
tony
i
should
have
a
moment
with
him
alone
whereas
the
process
of
wheedling
might
take
many
minutes
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
wait
and
that
was
the
hardest
task
ever
given
me
i
shall
not
forget
that
day
even
if
i
live
to
be
an
old
woman
and
looking
back
on
it
now
over
the
months
which
have
passed
since
months
which
seem
longer
than
all
the
rest
of
my
life
put
together
i
believe
that
my
very
character
took
on
some
change
in
those
hours
as
metal
is
changed
if
you
throw
it
on
to
the
fire
i
felt
for
the
first
time
that
i
was
a
woman
with
all
the
childishness
burnt
out
of
me
and
i
was
glad
for
i
might
have
to
do
battle
with
those
who
were
older
and
wiser
than
dalziel
and
milly
did
appear
till
noon
but
meanwhile
i
went
down
and
talked
to
a
great
many
people
in
the
hotel
people
whom
i
did
know
after
the
excitement
of
the
night
everybody
chattered
and
exchanged
impressions
with
everybody
else
without
stopping
to
think
or
care
whether
they
had
been
introduced
to
each
other
a
few
of
the
men
had
a
vague
idea
that
something
was
being
hushed
up
but
none
could
guess
what
it
was
and
nobody
knew
anything
about
captain
march
naturally
i
did
tell
what
i
had
been
told
that
he
was
under
arrest
i
trusted
with
all
my
heart
that
no
one
else
had
heard
or
would
hear
the
story
and
i
prayed
that
it
might
not
be
true
to
milly
i
would
not
speak
of
him
at
all
for
though
she
had
apologized
for
yesterday
and
made
friends
with
me
again
i
knew
that
there
was
a
cruel
streak
in
her
which
would
rejoice
revengefully
now
in
any
trouble
that
fell
on
eagle
she
would
feel
that
it
was
a
direct
punishment
sent
by
fate
for
his
indifference
to
her
and
the
way
in
which
for
her
own
good
she
had
forced
him
to
show
it
we
had
been
engaged
for
a
short
motor
run
with
tony
in
the
afternoon
but
i
was
more
disappointed
than
surprised
when
he
sent
a
hurried
note
to
his
mother
saying
that
there
was
so
much
business
to
do
he
get
off
he
might
not
even
be
able
to
dine
we
were
not
to
wait
but
he
would
turn
up
in
time
for
dinner
at
if
he
could
in
any
case
he
would
come
in
for
a
while
later
i
had
an
evening
dress
di
had
given
me
after
she
had
tired
of
it
which
i
had
altered
for
myself
and
tony
particularly
liked
it
i
put
it
on
for
dinner
that
night
tony
did
manage
to
come
bearing
an
offering
flowers
for
all
three
of
us
i
saw
that
he
noticed
the
frock
and
with
a
little
meaning
smile
at
him
i
tucked
one
of
his
roses
down
into
the
neck
he
flushed
up
at
that
poor
boy
all
over
his
nice
billiken
face
and
i
felt
like
every
cat
in
christendom
rolled
into
one
but
it
was
the
first
move
in
my
game
i
hoped
that
after
so
much
encouragement
he
would
make
some
excuse
after
dinner
to
get
me
to
himself
scarcely
a
word
was
said
during
the
meal
concerning
captain
march
dalziel
inquired
about
him
tony
with
his
mouth
full
answered
indistinctly
and
hurriedly
that
he
was
getting
along
all
right
as
well
as
anybody
could
expect
and
milly
viperishly
turned
the
subject
to
major
vandyke
exploit
he
be
a
greater
popular
hero
now
than
captain
march
ever
was
she
remarked
with
an
elaborately
impersonal
air
the
first
thing
we
know
peggy
we
shall
hear
that
lady
di
is
engaged
to
him
do
you
think
she
adores
heroes
she
once
told
me
so
what
a
romance
that
would
be
beamed
nice
dalziel
who
never
saw
under
the
surface
of
anything
but
i
was
grateful
to
her
for
breaking
in
and
saving
me
the
necessity
of
an
answer
to
milly
questions
if
i
had
replied
truthfully
i
should
have
had
to
say
that
it
was
exactly
what
i
think
whatever
the
secret
of
the
night
might
turn
out
to
be
i
felt
sure
that
sidney
vandyke
had
made
a
desperate
bid
to
win
diana
away
from
eagle
march
and
with
pangs
of
sharp
remorse
i
remembered
those
angry
words
of
mine
which
had
perhaps
spurred
him
to
the
effort
neither
dalziel
nor
milly
appeared
to
have
any
suspicions
that
the
origin
of
the
night
alarm
was
not
precisely
what
the
newspapers
reported
that
simplified
things
for
tony
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
and
i
was
careful
not
to
fling
at
him
a
single
embarrassing
question
as
dinner
went
on
he
lost
the
worried
look
he
had
brought
with
him
a
look
that
was
a
misfit
for
his
merry
personality
he
glanced
often
with
a
rather
pathetic
wistfulness
at
me
which
i
read
very
easily
and
shamefacedly
and
at
last
he
broke
out
with
information
concerning
a
torchlight
procession
that
would
set
forth
from
one
of
the
parks
of
el
paso
of
course
i
knew
what
this
remark
was
leading
up
to
he
heard
people
say
he
went
on
that
there
was
going
to
be
quite
a
good
impromptu
show
celebrating
the
end
of
the
scare
for
it
was
generally
felt
that
major
vandyke
diplomatic
dash
had
cleared
the
air
of
danger
and
if
there
had
ever
been
any
real
peril
it
was
past
now
once
and
for
all
would
we
like
to
go
out
and
see
the
sight
promptly
milly
answered
for
her
mother
and
herself
they
would
not
like
to
go
out
and
see
the
sight
if
there
was
anything
worth
the
trouble
of
looking
at
probably
it
could
be
seen
from
the
hotel
windows
but
what
about
lady
peggy
tony
asked
i
love
to
go
with
you
i
answered
i
put
on
a
long
cloak
the
one
i
had
worn
to
see
our
battery
off
at
fort
alvarado
railway
station
and
tony
and
i
sallied
forth
together
it
was
not
till
we
were
safely
in
the
street
that
he
told
me
we
were
early
for
the
procession
never
mind
said
i
it
lovely
to
be
out
in
the
blue
night
we
just
stroll
through
quiet
streets
where
there
be
a
crowd
to
bother
us
until
it
time
to
go
and
gaze
at
the
torches
there
a
nice
little
sort
of
park
he
suggested
not
too
far
away
how
would
you
like
to
walk
there
i
said
i
would
like
it
and
as
our
little
sort
of
park
was
the
park
whence
the
procession
would
start
we
had
it
practically
to
ourselves
we
found
an
empty
seat
and
sat
down
side
by
side
like
a
tommy
atkins
and
his
girl
in
kensington
gardens
the
first
thing
that
tony
did
when
we
were
anchored
together
there
was
to
propose
again
after
an
apology
i
let
him
get
it
over
and
then
played
the
next
pawn
in
my
game
chapter
xi
tony
dear
i
said
softly
when
he
had
finished
i
like
you
better
than
any
man
i
know
except
one
and
that
one
thinks
of
me
as
his
good
little
sister
so
you
need
be
afraid
of
interference
but
there
something
that
interfere
what
is
it
he
eagerly
wanted
to
know
it
is
that
you
do
really
love
me
he
stared
at
me
through
the
deepening
dusk
do
love
you
good
lord
lady
peggy
i
a
fool
about
you
any
can
see
that
ah
but
i
not
a
i
know
you
do
love
me
you
proved
that
last
night
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
think
what
you
mean
i
i
told
you
i
try
to
be
your
friend
but
you
knew
what
that
meant
do
keep
me
in
suspense
you
hurt
my
feelings
dreadfully
i
been
brooding
over
it
all
day
i
hurt
your
feelings
why
you
ought
to
know
i
would
for
the
world
but
you
did
you
refused
to
trust
me
there
can
be
no
love
without
trust
i
trust
you
with
my
life
i
ca
to
save
myself
guess
what
driving
at
he
stopped
suddenly
my
meaning
had
dawned
on
him
in
that
instant
now
you
guessed
have
you
i
asked
when
for
a
few
seconds
which
i
counted
with
heartbeats
he
had
sat
tensely
silent
maybe
i
have
but
see
here
peggy
you
are
holding
that
against
me
are
you
it
would
be
fair
i
trust
you
with
anything
of
my
own
but
when
it
comes
to
other
people
business
official
business
did
you
ever
hear
the
lines
me
not
at
all
or
all
in
all
i
continued
to
torture
him
it
was
tennyson
who
made
vivien
say
those
words
to
merlin
she
was
deceiving
him
and
meant
to
ruin
him
when
wormed
out
his
secret
for
that
reason
it
is
a
very
appropriate
quotation
but
otherwise
it
particularly
so
if
you
trusted
me
for
yourself
you
trust
me
for
others
too
it
the
same
thing
or
else
it
nothing
i
not
like
vivien
i
do
mean
to
deceive
you
or
ruin
you
or
anything
horrid
and
i
could
if
i
would
you
do
need
to
tell
me
that
said
tony
very
miserable
and
making
me
miserable
as
well
i
know
you
true
blue
the
truest
and
bluest
but
there
are
some
things
i
got
no
right
to
do
even
for
you
peggy
i
cut
my
tongue
out
to
please
you
i
do
believe
i
would
but
to
use
it
in
a
dishonourable
way
for
your
sake
is
dif
there
i
you
you
did
love
me
i
reproached
him
you
accuse
me
now
of
wanting
you
to
do
something
dishonourable
i
do
want
you
to
i
ca
see
that
it
would
be
dishonourable
to
put
me
out
of
suspense
about
a
dear
friend
like
captain
march
a
man
who
in
love
with
my
sister
and
wants
to
marry
her
as
you
surely
know
but
that
settles
everything
between
us
of
course
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
you
tony
i
must
say
that
i
not
certain
even
if
you
did
what
i
have
asked
that
i
be
able
to
do
what
ask
love
you
except
as
a
friend
said
before
that
i
could
but
i
might
have
changed
my
mind
in
future
for
all
i
know
if
if
echoed
tony
that
a
darned
cruel
way
to
put
it
and
he
looked
so
much
like
the
nicest
billiken
ever
seen
on
earth
that
i
really
did
love
him
though
not
quite
in
the
way
he
wanted
no
doubt
i
am
cruel
as
well
as
dishonourable
i
replied
frigidly
so
now
you
can
easily
stop
loving
me
ca
you
no
i
ca
he
said
see
here
peggy
what
can
i
say
or
do
to
make
things
right
i
think
you
the
kindest
and
dearest
and
most
honourable
girl
whoever
lived
and
i
prove
it
then
i
cried
and
i
laid
my
hands
on
his
how
what
can
i
do
tell
me
the
whole
truth
about
what
happened
last
night
oh
i
not
trying
to
bribe
you
i
do
promise
if
you
do
tell
that
i
love
you
or
marry
you
or
anything
important
of
that
sort
all
i
promise
is
to
be
so
grateful
so
glad
that
who
knows
how
i
may
feel
to
you
afterward
and
anyhow
i
let
you
kiss
me
this
very
night
on
my
cheek
you
will
yet
you
say
you
not
bribing
me
you
could
offer
me
a
much
bigger
bribe
why
peggy
i
be
happy
just
to
die
after
getting
a
kiss
from
you
even
on
your
cheek
and
he
laughed
at
himself
forlornly
you
a
dear
boy
tony
i
said
crushed
with
remorse
the
kiss
be
a
bribe
either
it
will
be
a
token
of
of
i
hardly
know
what
but
partly
of
gratitude
the
deepest
gratitude
if
you
can
trust
me
enough
to
believe
i
be
true
i
do
believe
that
indeed
i
do
believe
it
forever
and
and
by
jove
i
tell
you
he
broke
out
with
a
kind
of
breathless
gasp
you
too
strong
for
me
peggy
you
me
but
after
all
there
no
such
great
harm
in
telling
now
it
different
from
last
night
then
i
did
know
nobody
knew
i
suppose
what
the
upshot
of
certain
things
might
be
as
it
turned
out
some
of
the
story
will
have
to
be
known
not
all
but
the
part
you
want
to
know
most
tell
me
that
i
pleaded
you
swear
you
never
breathe
anything
i
say
to
you
i
swear
i
never
will
until
you
give
me
leave
well
then
those
three
explosions
you
heard
last
night
explosions
at
all
were
shots
from
our
field
but
i
tell
you
what
happened
exactly
both
sides
of
the
story
both
sides
how
is
it
there
are
two
well
there
march
side
and
and
what
other
one
and
major
vandyke
side
i
knew
it
i
cried
out
sharply
i
knew
that
man
would
try
to
ruin
eagle
i
should
like
to
shoot
him
with
one
of
those
very
guns
peggy
you
must
talk
like
that
tony
warned
me
if
you
do
i
go
on
forgive
me
i
said
and
let
him
hold
my
hand
happy
for
a
moment
in
the
belief
that
he
was
soothing
me
you
know
you
heard
i
guess
that
vandyke
was
in
command
last
night
because
the
colonel
had
a
touch
of
the
sun
but
that
is
the
right
way
to
begin
my
story
i
hanged
if
i
know
how
to
begin
it
we
were
up
there
on
the
hill
with
the
guns
on
guard
i
mean
i
was
and
the
men
and
march
came
along
and
strolled
off
again
a
little
way
with
his
field
glasses
maybe
thirty
or
forty
yards
distant
he
was
i
noticing
anything
felt
rather
sleepy
and
was
trying
all
i
knew
to
keep
awake
i
was
in
charge
of
the
guns
you
see
i
guess
i
was
thinking
about
you
i
generally
am
anyhow
the
first
thing
i
knew
march
hurried
back
he
seemed
queer
and
excited
and
stood
still
a
minute
as
if
he
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
then
to
my
amazement
he
rapped
out
an
order
to
load
and
fire
number
one
and
number
two
guns
aiming
at
a
spot
just
beyond
the
bridge
but
before
we
had
time
to
do
more
than
gasp
i
and
the
gunners
he
changed
his
order
and
commanded
us
to
fire
blank
lord
that
was
a
relief
though
even
blank
would
be
bad
enough
for
the
lot
of
us
if
it
turned
out
that
march
had
gone
suddenly
mad
you
fire
blank
for
a
salute
you
know
but
mexico
was
likely
to
take
it
as
a
compliment
luckily
we
some
rounds
of
blank
served
out
to
us
in
case
we
might
need
to
send
a
scare
and
not
a
peppering
across
the
river
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
obey
orders
though
i
could
help
thinking
about
charge
of
the
light
brigade
when
every
one
knew
that
some
one
had
blundered
march
shouted
out
slow
and
you
bet
we
did
go
slow
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
be
off
his
head
or
somebody
else
was
for
so
far
as
we
could
tell
and
it
was
a
fairly
clear
night
there
was
a
sign
of
trouble
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
we
only
fired
the
three
shots
when
major
vandyke
pounced
on
us
ordered
us
to
stop
and
wanted
to
know
what
the
devil
and
all
his
angels
march
was
up
to
out
orders
said
march
a
da
but
what
the
use
of
repeating
to
you
peggy
what
they
said
to
each
other
the
principal
thing
is
vandyke
denied
having
given
any
order
to
fire
and
cursed
march
for
all
he
was
worth
said
he
might
be
the
cause
of
bringing
us
and
mexico
to
grips
over
the
incident
then
he
dashed
off
in
his
automobile
which
was
waiting
for
him
under
the
hill
he
been
in
it
you
know
or
he
could
have
got
to
the
spot
so
soon
you
must
have
read
that
in
the
papers
and
so
much
of
their
story
was
true
whatever
you
may
think
of
vandyke
peggy
that
was
size
work
he
took
his
life
in
his
hands
the
way
the
mexicans
must
have
been
buzzing
in
their
wasp
nest
over
there
after
the
hot
water
thrown
on
it
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
he
love
to
do
i
said
implacably
the
theatrical
thing
he
must
have
known
too
that
the
man
driving
the
car
was
the
one
in
greater
danger
but
did
drive
he
never
does
drive
he
did
just
funk
it
at
that
one
time
it
his
habit
i
always
heard
him
say
he
hated
to
drive
a
car
too
lazy
anyhow
there
was
the
very
dickens
to
pay
before
leaving
the
hill
for
his
dash
across
the
river
he
told
march
to
consider
himself
under
arrest
how
dared
he
i
fiercely
wanted
to
know
that
was
his
business
oh
yes
it
was
he
march
superior
officer
besides
any
officer
has
the
right
if
but
i
wo
worry
your
head
with
military
rules
and
regulations
what
you
want
to
know
is
how
this
affects
captain
march
do
you
yes
that
the
great
thing
to
me
i
admitted
tony
will
it
ruin
him
it
early
days
to
say
as
much
as
that
yet
it
all
depends
on
the
result
of
the
will
he
be
of
course
there
nothing
else
for
it
it
a
question
which
of
those
two
men
can
establish
his
case
and
a
will
have
to
decide
between
them
but
i
afraid
peggy
it
will
go
against
march
the
circumstances
were
so
very
queer
and
vandyke
denial
of
giving
any
order
at
all
is
so
strong
besides
it
would
be
such
a
mad
improbable
thing
for
him
to
give
such
an
order
as
there
was
no
danger
of
attack
he
have
no
motive
he
would
have
a
motive
i
broke
in
i
can
prove
that
will
they
let
a
woman
bear
witness
for
a
prisoner
in
a
military
i
suppose
your
evidence
could
be
taken
if
they
were
certain
it
had
an
important
bearing
on
the
case
but
i
do
see
how
that
could
have
peggy
this
is
women
business
it
men
and
devils
i
finished
for
him
we
wo
argue
now
whether
my
evidence
could
be
important
or
not
tell
me
both
sides
of
the
story
you
were
speaking
of
first
captain
march
then
major
vandyke
well
march
says
that
while
he
was
strolling
about
at
a
short
distance
from
the
guns
looking
through
his
field
glasses
at
a
fire
he
could
see
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
he
saw
a
chap
in
khaki
hurry
up
the
hill
wheeling
a
bicycle
as
soon
as
the
fellow
came
near
enough
to
make
out
his
features
march
says
he
recognized
vandyke
orderly
a
man
who
been
the
major
soldier
servant
for
a
good
length
of
time
this
orderly
according
to
march
brought
a
verbal
order
from
vandyke
as
acting
colonel
to
begin
firing
number
one
and
number
two
guns
and
keep
them
in
action
until
further
notice
aiming
at
a
spot
just
beyond
one
of
the
bridges
on
the
mexican
side
march
said
he
was
so
astounded
at
getting
such
an
order
he
thought
there
must
be
some
awful
mistake
and
before
obeying
he
wanted
to
have
it
on
paper
so
he
took
the
risk
of
any
danger
from
delay
in
case
the
order
was
really
all
right
and
scribbled
a
few
lines
to
vandyke
on
a
leaf
torn
out
of
his
notebook
a
leaf
torn
out
of
his
notebook
i
could
help
echoing
perhaps
it
was
the
one
i
gave
him
should
wonder
tony
went
on
stolidly
he
says
he
repeated
in
writing
the
command
he
just
received
and
begged
vandyke
if
it
was
correct
to
confirm
him
in
the
same
way
the
messenger
dashed
off
leaving
march
wondering
like
thunder
what
it
all
meant
whether
there
was
some
fearful
mistake
or
whether
there
was
a
big
crisis
and
no
time
for
written
orders
he
could
see
of
course
that
it
might
be
possible
and
that
vandyke
had
ordered
only
those
two
guns
to
be
fired
just
to
scare
the
mexicans
off
from
playing
any
trick
they
were
at
the
spot
he
was
to
aim
at
suggested
that
explanation
for
not
much
harm
ought
to
be
done
with
a
few
shots
directed
that
way
not
much
of
what
you
might
call
harm
i
mean
but
there
was
no
end
to
the
harm
such
an
incident
could
do
if
there
been
nothing
to
provoke
it
you
see
the
situation
as
march
says
he
saw
it
do
you
yes
i
see
but
what
happened
after
that
according
to
march
the
orderly
was
back
again
in
next
to
no
time
march
had
stopped
where
he
was
waiting
for
him
as
he
did
want
to
give
the
snap
away
to
me
and
the
men
till
the
last
minute
and
he
was
hoping
against
hope
till
he
got
the
return
message
it
was
verbal
again
in
spite
of
his
written
request
and
mighty
peremptory
ordering
him
to
obey
without
any
more
nonsense
that
march
story
not
seeing
a
way
to
get
out
of
it
yet
realizing
the
awful
consequences
should
there
be
anything
wrong
march
was
going
to
pass
on
the
order
to
load
and
fire
when
he
suddenly
thought
he
compromise
by
firing
blank
only
you
see
he
was
in
an
awful
fix
anyway
had
to
make
an
instant
decision
and
did
what
he
thought
best
at
the
moment
though
in
giving
that
order
to
fire
blank
he
was
already
disobeying
the
orders
of
his
superior
officer
vandyke
version
is
that
he
never
sent
any
orders
whatever
that
his
orderly
was
with
him
in
his
car
and
had
never
left
it
for
a
minute
that
march
must
have
been
deceived
by
some
trick
of
resemblance
a
sort
of
of
kopenick
if
you
know
that
story
getting
off
a
hoax
on
him
a
deadly
hoax
meant
to
upset
the
whole
situation
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
he
says
march
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
obey
a
verbal
order
when
the
thing
was
so
serious
and
that
he
was
something
worse
than
an
ass
to
mistake
a
stranger
for
johnson
the
orderly
whose
face
march
knew
almost
as
well
as
his
own
there
where
vandyke
scores
an
extra
point
against
march
it
would
be
very
unusual
to
send
a
verbal
order
that
why
eagle
doubted
it
i
argued
breathlessly
he
have
refused
to
obey
the
acting
colonel
when
the
order
was
repeated
that
the
question
it
too
big
for
me
tony
said
with
a
sigh
for
the
to
settle
there
are
no
witnesses
who
can
be
of
much
use
on
either
side
so
far
as
i
can
see
johnson
was
wounded
in
the
lungs
last
night
you
know
crossing
the
bridge
in
vandyke
car
and
never
so
much
as
squeaked
again
he
dead
now
so
vandyke
has
to
depend
on
his
own
word
alone
but
everybody
who
knows
about
the
business
seems
to
think
that
probabilities
are
with
him
his
story
is
that
he
knew
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
till
he
heard
the
guns
at
work
luckily
he
was
near
by
in
his
car
as
you
heard
a
dozen
times
and
dashed
up
to
the
rescue
what
about
the
message
eagle
wrote
in
his
notebook
there
only
his
own
word
to
prove
it
was
ever
written
naturally
there
no
trace
of
it
but
you
i
persisted
you
and
your
men
who
were
in
charge
of
the
guns
ca
any
of
you
bear
witness
for
captain
march
that
you
saw
major
vandyke
orderly
unfortunately
for
march
no
not
a
man
jack
of
us
said
tony
if
been
close
to
us
at
the
time
we
must
have
seen
and
recognized
anybody
who
came
and
spoke
to
him
but
i
told
you
he
strolled
off
it
our
business
to
watch
him
and
nobody
was
watching
a
man
on
foot
wheeling
a
bicycle
does
make
much
noise
and
a
khaki
uniform
is
just
about
the
colour
of
the
ground
on
that
yellow
hill
there
was
no
moon
only
stars
which
means
no
black
shadow
i
shall
be
called
on
as
a
witness
for
the
defence
of
course
worse
luck
but
i
afraid
i
say
anything
to
help
march
i
wish
to
the
lord
i
could
i
dashed
if
it
is
the
other
way
round
if
i
not
mighty
careful
i
may
do
him
harm
instead
of
good
you
to
do
him
good
would
you
i
pleaded
you
bet
your
life
i
would
peggy
march
is
just
about
the
finest
chap
i
ever
met
and
most
people
think
the
same
of
him
but
what
can
i
do
i
ca
see
i
said
but
i
may
when
things
grow
clearer
they
grow
clearer
you
for
one
believe
eagle
word
do
you
tony
you
believe
it
was
major
vandyke
orderly
who
came
to
him
as
i
asked
this
question
i
stared
through
the
twilight
into
face
trying
to
read
it
even
as
he
tried
not
to
let
it
be
read
he
looked
wretchedly
uneasy
and
rather
obstinate
i
ca
say
i
sure
of
that
he
replied
i
sure
some
one
came
to
him
and
i
sure
march
it
was
vandyke
orderly
that
as
far
as
i
can
go
even
when
i
told
you
that
i
know
there
a
motive
for
major
vandyke
wanting
to
injure
him
ruin
him
in
his
career
if
he
can
you
seem
to
think
vandyke
a
regular
sort
of
villain
out
of
melodrama
said
tony
with
an
uncomfortable
laugh
i
guess
you
know
men
very
well
yet
peggy
except
in
novels
and
plays
when
it
comes
down
to
bedrock
they
not
much
like
that
in
real
life
as
far
as
ever
seen
they
never
go
round
plotting
to
ruin
other
chaps
careers
even
when
they
do
happen
to
get
along
very
well
with
not
so
very
old
you
have
had
much
more
experience
of
life
than
i
have
i
taunted
him
tony
laughed
have
i
that
all
you
know
you
a
child
a
little
compared
to
me
i
may
be
young
but
anyhow
i
a
man
and
i
lived
among
men
since
i
left
west
point
two
years
ago
even
if
you
do
count
cadets
as
men
vandyke
no
angel
and
he
and
march
have
been
doing
a
bit
of
the
act
in
a
quiet
way
lately
but
pretty
to
accuse
vandyke
of
hatching
up
a
plot
to
wipe
march
off
the
map
especially
when
it
meant
risking
his
own
life
and
sacrificing
his
orderly
who
was
devoted
to
him
a
fellow
he
valued
a
whole
lot
ah
i
broke
in
so
the
orderly
was
to
him
i
wonder
if
the
will
remember
that
fact
for
what
it
worth
for
what
it
worth
yes
i
guess
it
can
be
trusted
to
do
just
that
but
what
there
is
will
be
likely
to
tell
in
vandyke
favour
i
guess
not
against
him
johnson
had
good
reasons
for
being
devoted
to
the
major
the
chap
got
consumption
and
was
in
a
bad
way
would
have
had
to
say
to
an
army
life
if
vandyke
had
paid
for
his
cure
in
one
of
the
best
sanatoria
in
america
and
used
influence
to
keep
his
job
open
for
him
too
nothing
very
black
in
that
record
eh
major
vandyke
the
kind
of
person
to
pay
high
for
anything
he
really
wants
himself
i
said
he
must
have
badly
wanted
this
johnson
man
for
something
or
other
johnson
was
born
a
sort
of
gentleman
but
had
the
art
of
getting
along
in
life
although
he
was
pretty
near
being
a
genius
at
mathematics
as
well
as
mechanics
and
could
do
stunts
in
several
languages
like
you
no
shame
to
vandyke
to
make
use
of
the
man
gifts
he
must
have
been
jolly
useful
too
useful
to
waste
it
wo
make
me
love
you
better
tony
i
remarked
with
deliberate
injustice
for
there
are
moods
when
any
girl
must
feel
a
horrid
satisfaction
in
being
unjust
if
you
go
on
praising
major
vandyke
to
the
skies
does
it
matter
why
the
orderly
was
devoted
to
him
or
he
to
the
orderly
the
thing
of
importance
is
the
tie
between
them
the
more
devoted
the
man
was
the
more
willing
he
would
be
to
go
to
any
lengths
for
major
vandyke
oh
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way
tony
hedged
but
it
a
notion
like
the
motive
you
attribute
to
vandyke
how
do
you
know
what
motive
i
mean
i
shot
at
him
i
have
told
you
may
be
an
ass
but
i
not
a
ass
quoted
tony
guessed
what
have
you
guessed
oh
about
vandyke
and
march
both
being
in
love
with
lady
diana
all
the
owliest
owls
are
on
to
that
first
time
vandyke
was
ever
caught
for
keeps
the
fellows
say
but
it
would
only
do
harm
to
march
to
bring
anything
of
that
sort
up
in
this
business
to
say
nothing
of
the
bad
taste
and
how
mad
he
be
and
the
unpleasantness
for
lady
diana
and
and
all
your
family
it
would
be
agreeable
i
know
i
admitted
but
anything
to
save
eagle
no
matter
how
we
sacrifice
ourselves
i
do
somehow
hear
lady
di
echoing
that
though
i
agree
with
you
only
there
more
in
the
thing
than
you
seem
to
see
because
you
keep
your
eyes
fixed
on
one
spot
if
lady
diana
engaged
to
major
vandyke
then
he
have
no
incentive
to
strike
at
another
man
who
was
gone
on
her
it
would
be
the
other
way
round
the
chap
who
had
lost
her
would
be
the
one
if
any
to
be
up
to
melodramatic
stunts
it
might
be
said
about
march
that
he
risked
trouble
for
himself
for
the
pleasure
of
having
a
smack
at
vandyke
putting
the
blame
on
him
for
a
mad
order
to
fire
off
guns
at
the
good
little
mexicans
for
instance
do
you
see
i
did
see
and
seeing
suffered
a
sharp
stab
of
disappointment
tony
had
taken
my
one
weapon
out
of
my
hands
he
was
right
i
had
been
wrong
while
thinking
myself
cleverer
than
he
there
must
be
some
other
way
of
clearing
eagle
i
said
desperately
i
hope
so
with
my
whole
heart
although
i
always
had
a
sneaking
admiration
for
vandyke
too
he
such
a
dashed
chap
a
credit
to
the
army
and
all
that
to
clear
march
really
clear
him
without
leaving
a
stain
of
carelessness
even
means
to
ruin
vandyke
for
march
ca
be
made
white
as
snow
without
vandyke
being
proved
a
liar
and
by
jove
yes
a
traitor
to
his
country
that
what
he
must
be
proved
i
said
it
be
a
tough
proposition
as
i
see
it
there
no
proof
it
must
be
found
that
easy
to
say
but
if
there
any
it
ought
to
be
found
by
the
court
when
will
the
trial
come
on
i
asked
in
a
few
days
i
do
know
yet
just
when
in
the
meantime
eagle
is
under
arrest
yes
it
sickening
are
his
friends
i
mean
among
the
officers
indignant
they
mighty
sorry
all
broken
up
and
do
know
what
to
think
but
of
course
major
vandyke
got
a
good
many
friends
too
as
for
the
fort
bliss
officers
they
so
wild
about
the
whole
business
that
i
afraid
they
a
bit
prejudiced
against
march
those
of
them
who
do
know
him
personally
you
see
there
was
an
awful
row
on
the
hill
after
the
firing
but
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
about
that
why
not
as
i
know
the
rest
i
suppose
some
of
them
arrived
i
should
say
they
did
arrive
that
too
slow
a
word
the
noise
shot
out
of
their
blessed
beds
those
of
who
had
gone
to
bed
and
brought
the
others
out
of
any
old
place
they
happened
to
be
in
club
hotel
friends
houses
the
first
thing
we
knew
we
had
the
general
commanding
on
us
they
know
language
those
grand
old
johnnies
poor
march
he
was
up
against
it
i
can
tell
you
his
worst
enemy
would
have
been
sorry
for
him
fiends
what
did
they
do
i
gasped
it
was
so
much
what
they
did
as
what
they
said
but
i
give
you
details
peggy
so
do
try
and
worm
out
of
me
it
only
waste
our
valuable
time
march
was
under
arrest
enough
i
suppose
he
ought
to
be
grateful
that
it
been
expedient
that
the
phrase
never
to
let
the
story
in
its
full
enormity
leak
out
vandyke
was
so
smart
at
apologies
and
explanations
in
that
mexican
dash
of
his
last
night
and
the
part
he
played
appealed
such
a
lot
to
the
chaps
over
there
who
nothing
if
they
not
sensational
that
it
hoped
the
incident
wo
have
any
serious
international
results
at
all
the
great
thing
is
to
keep
the
business
forever
from
the
public
on
both
sides
of
the
rio
grande
luckily
most
people
had
the
willies
so
badly
after
the
first
shot
that
they
swear
what
sort
of
noise
they
heard
it
a
hard
job
too
for
an
amateur
to
tell
what
direction
a
sound
comes
from
when
his
eyes
helped
his
ears
if
vandyke
had
put
a
stop
to
any
danger
of
return
shots
the
fat
would
have
been
in
the
fire
for
us
thanks
to
him
that
story
of
an
explosion
among
the
ammunition
could
pass
muster
as
for
march
alleged
that
tale
to
get
him
out
of
his
social
engagements
without
stirring
up
talk
but
it
wo
be
believed
in
for
long
the
findings
can
be
kept
secret
but
not
the
fact
of
its
taking
place
it
to
be
put
round
that
march
was
accused
of
gross
carelessness
and
causing
the
that
occurred
so
now
you
see
peggy
your
keeping
dark
about
what
i
told
you
is
all
for
march
good
if
he
found
guilty
what
then
i
breathed
what
will
be
the
sentence
why
as
the
affair
has
to
be
hushed
up
forever
he
ca
be
he
probably
be
permission
to
resign
and
then
he
will
resign
and
nobody
outside
will
ever
know
why
those
inside
will
think
jolly
well
in
luck
to
be
let
down
so
easy
considering
all
what
i
did
speak
i
whispered
why
peggy
you
crying
i
could
answer
i
only
bent
down
my
head
lest
he
should
see
my
face
i
felt
from
the
first
i
ought
to
have
told
you
growled
tony
now
i
sure
do
take
it
so
hard
dear
something
may
turn
up
we
think
of
and
march
get
off
scot
free
who
knows
anyhow
he
nothing
but
your
friend
and
your
sister
is
likely
to
marry
him
now
i
should
be
surprised
if
she
engaged
to
vandyke
already
it
was
settled
between
them
i
said
swallowing
my
tears
only
i
thought
she
liked
eagle
better
and
that
if
he
plenty
of
money
but
it
all
over
no
hope
since
this
thing
has
happened
would
you
like
to
have
her
marry
march
tony
wanted
to
know
i
not
sure
but
it
will
be
too
dreadful
if
she
marries
major
vandyke
after
what
he
has
done
why
do
you
say
you
wonder
if
engaged
already
and
a
little
while
ago
too
you
said
lady
di
is
engaged
to
vandyke
di
ca
have
heard
yet
that
there
any
reason
why
why
the
most
disloyal
coward
should
drop
eagle
march
there
are
such
things
as
telegrams
and
the
big
california
papers
must
have
got
hold
of
the
story
printed
in
el
paso
this
morning
they
sure
to
have
correspondents
here
i
bet
lady
di
had
vandyke
as
a
hero
served
up
to
her
with
her
coffee
at
breakfast
would
she
wire
and
congratulate
him
would
he
wire
back
to
her
and
strike
while
the
iron
was
hot
to
get
her
promise
that
what
i
do
if
i
were
in
his
place
i
never
thought
i
began
but
no
more
words
would
come
i
felt
broken
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
look
ahead
and
see
the
whole
future
i
let
my
hand
lie
in
tony
and
he
stroked
it
gently
not
speaking
or
trying
to
make
me
speak
silence
was
the
only
balm
just
then
if
balm
there
was
and
a
loud
burst
of
music
not
far
off
struck
on
my
brain
like
the
blow
of
a
hammer
we
had
forgotten
all
about
the
torchlight
procession
which
we
had
come
out
to
see
but
by
and
by
tony
did
not
forget
his
kiss
chapter
xii
if
i
could
without
betraying
tony
i
should
have
written
to
eagle
that
night
telling
him
just
a
hundredth
part
of
what
i
thought
and
felt
but
i
was
bound
by
my
word
to
keep
dark
what
i
had
heard
even
from
eagle
himself
unless
some
day
tony
set
me
free
to
speak
i
must
seem
to
know
and
believe
what
the
public
knew
and
believed
no
more
but
i
did
write
cautiously
saying
how
grieved
i
was
if
he
suffered
how
i
should
think
of
him
every
hour
and
how
i
wished
that
some
way
might
be
arranged
for
me
to
see
him
by
and
by
could
it
be
managed
i
asked
and
i
posted
the
letter
before
i
went
to
bed
tired
to
the
heart
and
more
miserable
than
i
had
ever
been
in
my
life
the
next
morning
before
i
was
out
of
my
room
a
telegram
was
brought
to
the
door
it
was
from
di
and
said
am
engaged
to
major
vandyke
he
will
probably
call
and
tell
you
the
news
himself
but
thought
i
should
like
you
to
know
first
from
me
please
be
nice
to
him
for
my
sake
i
am
very
happy
what
a
hero
he
is
write
me
all
about
what
happened
this
was
a
long
expensive
message
to
lavish
on
me
but
diana
days
of
economy
were
over
and
this
was
the
first
sign
of
the
change
i
boiled
with
anger
against
her
and
should
have
liked
to
send
some
of
my
emotions
over
the
telegraph
wire
but
that
would
have
been
a
childish
way
to
strike
besides
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
i
was
a
little
unjust
di
had
treated
eagle
shamefully
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
but
there
was
one
thing
in
her
favour
she
was
not
conscious
of
betraying
eagle
march
in
the
hour
of
danger
for
she
knew
about
him
only
what
the
papers
said
that
he
had
been
wounded
in
an
accident
it
was
major
great
exploit
which
had
weighed
down
the
scales
in
his
favour
or
influenced
diana
anyhow
to
throw
eagle
over
definitely
and
announce
her
engagement
to
the
hero
i
telegraphed
back
do
make
it
public
till
you
heard
from
me
you
may
change
your
mind
i
followed
the
wire
with
a
letter
in
which
i
assured
di
that
major
vandyke
had
committed
a
crime
against
eagle
march
perhaps
it
would
be
found
out
and
then
she
would
be
very
sorry
that
she
had
promised
to
marry
such
a
man
i
dared
not
hope
much
from
my
protest
however
so
two
days
later
i
was
surprised
to
hear
that
di
was
disgusted
as
well
as
hurt
by
my
wicked
prejudice
against
sidney
you
never
liked
him
she
said
but
i
did
think
you
would
go
so
far
as
to
accuse
him
of
crimes
if
it
were
so
silly
it
would
be
horrible
as
it
is
i
ca
help
laughing
but
all
the
same
be
careful
what
you
say
to
other
people
if
you
speak
against
sidney
to
strangers
you
ca
do
him
any
harm
but
you
will
do
yourself
a
great
deal
and
captain
march
too
sidney
has
written
me
a
long
letter
telling
me
the
whole
history
of
that
thursday
night
it
has
just
come
of
course
i
can
repeat
to
what
he
wrote
it
was
strictly
confidential
though
i
suppose
the
truth
is
bound
to
leak
out
more
or
less
in
future
judging
from
your
hints
i
suppose
you
too
have
heard
something
probably
from
tony
dalziel
whom
i
hope
by
the
way
you
are
treating
better
than
you
did
as
you
never
likely
to
get
another
such
chance
naturally
you
believe
the
other
side
but
after
the
there
wo
be
any
side
there
was
just
one
consolation
in
the
next
few
days
a
letter
that
came
to
me
from
eagle
he
said
not
a
word
that
any
one
might
have
read
and
told
me
nothing
about
himself
except
that
he
was
getting
along
very
well
and
i
must
spend
a
sad
minute
over
him
but
he
added
your
thought
of
me
and
your
unfailing
friendship
are
more
to
me
than
i
can
express
i
feel
that
nothing
can
rob
me
of
them
and
now
and
always
they
will
be
for
me
like
a
comforting
fire
at
which
i
can
warm
myself
when
days
are
cold
and
dark
i
count
on
you
my
little
peggy
girl
and
i
know
i
sha
count
in
vain
even
though
i
have
to
say
that
it
impossible
for
us
to
meet
now
or
for
some
time
to
come
write
to
me
when
you
feel
like
it
i
shall
be
more
than
glad
of
your
letters
if
i
had
written
when
i
felt
like
it
i
should
seldom
have
had
a
pen
out
of
my
hand
yet
it
was
hard
to
write
there
was
so
little
i
dared
so
much
i
wished
to
say
and
i
could
mention
diana
i
wondered
whether
she
had
broken
to
him
in
a
letter
the
news
of
her
engagement
or
whether
she
had
left
it
for
him
to
discover
by
accident
i
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
told
but
i
could
bear
to
be
the
one
to
deal
the
blow
so
i
hedged
when
i
wrote
to
him
next
asking
have
you
heard
from
d
lately
he
answered
the
question
briefly
by
the
next
post
yes
i
heard
from
her
on
saturday
that
was
all
no
comment
no
word
as
to
his
feelings
but
he
had
let
me
see
how
he
loved
her
he
could
not
help
knowing
that
i
would
understand
what
losing
her
meant
to
him
and
losing
her
to
major
vandyke
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
way
looking
back
at
events
i
calculated
that
the
blow
had
fallen
on
eagle
before
he
answered
my
letter
and
this
gave
a
more
pathetic
meaning
to
the
lines
which
i
intended
always
to
keep
except
for
the
knowledge
that
powerless
as
i
was
he
valued
me
there
was
no
brightness
in
my
days
major
vandyke
did
have
the
effrontery
to
come
and
see
me
as
di
had
thought
he
would
and
i
had
thought
he
would
he
took
me
at
a
disadvantage
by
walking
up
to
me
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
where
i
stood
reading
a
note
from
tony
warned
by
a
flash
of
my
eyes
as
i
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
saying
how
do
you
do
he
went
on
hastily
do
let
have
a
scene
please
for
sake
if
not
for
your
own
i
know
how
you
feel
so
you
need
go
to
the
length
of
telling
me
or
even
cutting
me
before
people
if
i
been
sure
you
were
too
much
of
a
little
lady
to
make
yourself
conspicuous
in
public
in
spite
of
your
feelings
i
should
have
risked
surprising
you
like
this
i
was
pretty
sure
if
i
did
catch
you
unawares
you
would
refuse
to
see
me
so
i
had
to
take
some
risk
for
i
particularly
want
to
speak
to
you
i
do
share
your
desire
i
said
stiffly
you
were
perfectly
right
in
thinking
i
should
have
seen
you
if
you
had
given
me
the
chance
to
refuse
it
like
you
not
to
have
given
it
but
you
right
too
when
you
take
it
for
granted
that
i
wo
make
a
scene
if
it
could
do
the
the
slightest
good
though
to
any
one
concerned
i
would
he
smiled
a
pale
unpleasant
smile
no
doubt
you
be
capable
of
anything
here
the
situation
i
going
to
marry
your
sister
and
though
you
tried
your
best
to
stop
me
you
ca
i
wonder
any
man
even
you
should
want
diana
after
the
way
behaved
i
said
sullenly
thanks
for
that
expressive
your
weapons
are
pretty
sharp
little
lady
but
you
a
child
and
you
diana
sister
so
i
bear
no
malice
i
the
sort
of
man
it
happens
who
does
stop
to
bother
much
about
the
way
a
very
beautiful
girl
to
another
fellow
i
love
diana
and
i
take
her
across
that
other
fellow
dead
body
if
just
stabbed
him
she
has
stabbed
captain
march
though
not
mortally
i
hope
said
i
but
she
has
behaved
as
badly
to
you
as
to
him
in
a
way
you
mean
the
affair
of
the
photograph
i
suppose
major
vandyke
remarked
calmly
she
has
explained
that
not
that
i
asked
her
to
all
i
did
was
to
put
into
a
letter
the
story
of
that
little
scene
in
which
you
were
mixed
up
in
march
tent
she
answered
voluntarily
that
march
must
have
bribed
the
photographer
to
sell
him
a
copy
though
the
man
had
been
given
strict
instructions
to
print
only
one
for
me
march
had
begged
her
for
a
picture
when
he
heard
from
main
that
she
been
sitting
for
that
fellow
who
supposed
to
be
a
great
artist
and
di
put
him
off
in
some
laughing
way
i
was
pretty
certain
when
i
noticed
there
was
no
signature
on
the
portrait
march
had
that
he
not
got
the
photograph
from
diana
herself
no
doubt
he
thought
all
fair
in
love
or
war
you
judge
him
by
yourself
i
said
but
never
mind
i
sha
ask
you
not
to
believe
di
but
to
believe
your
own
common
sense
think
or
pretend
to
think
what
you
like
i
shall
he
assured
me
that
a
great
principle
of
mine
as
a
general
rule
it
makes
for
happiness
and
success
but
we
getting
away
from
my
object
in
speaking
to
you
when
i
know
you
wishing
me
in
kingdom
come
not
there
said
i
he
laughed
out
aloud
and
anybody
looking
at
us
might
have
imagined
us
the
best
of
friends
what
a
little
devil
you
are
where
did
you
inherit
it
from
from
french
chocolate
perhaps
said
i
what
is
it
you
want
with
me
major
vandyke
tell
me
and
get
it
over
i
want
to
know
exactly
what
it
is
in
me
that
you
dislike
so
much
only
everything
that
a
large
order
and
not
very
explicit
would
you
have
disliked
me
if
i
had
interfered
with
a
er
a
person
more
to
your
taste
in
other
words
with
captain
eagleston
march
oh
of
course
if
you
had
been
jealous
of
him
i
might
have
thought
better
of
your
but
then
you
would
have
been
you
know
drawled
major
vandyke
i
a
sort
of
idea
that
it
was
captain
march
who
was
jealous
of
me
it
is
him
to
be
jealous
in
the
way
you
mean
but
you
asked
why
i
dislike
you
and
you
interrupted
me
before
i
could
finish
is
a
very
small
word
for
what
i
feel
i
loathe
you
because
you
done
your
best
to
ruin
him
there
are
some
things
i
partly
i
blame
myself
because
of
what
i
said
to
you
about
di
in
camp
perhaps
just
perhaps
you
might
have
done
what
you
have
done
if
held
my
tongue
that
why
if
i
had
a
hand
in
pulling
eagle
march
down
i
cut
it
off
and
the
other
one
too
if
i
could
have
a
hand
in
lifting
him
up
sounds
complicated
and
irish
sneered
vandyke
in
your
country
a
man
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
until
he
proved
guilty
yet
you
accuse
me
of
guilt
on
no
proof
whatever
evidently
you
wormed
things
out
of
tony
dalziel
and
drawn
your
own
conclusions
to
suit
yourself
so
like
a
woman
but
my
conscience
is
clear
as
crystal
personal
feeling
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
actions
every
man
will
give
me
credit
for
that
i
sorry
for
march
he
either
insane
with
jealousy
or
he
allowed
himself
to
be
tricked
privately
not
publicly
of
course
i
inclined
to
believe
in
the
former
theory
and
i
think
most
people
would
agree
with
me
if
they
knew
all
the
circumstances
as
you
put
them
let
go
back
to
my
object
in
inflicting
myself
upon
you
lady
peggy
eagleston
march
is
the
god
of
your
idolatry
let
take
that
for
granted
he
bound
to
suffer
he
brought
it
on
himself
whatever
you
a
child
may
think
to
the
contrary
do
you
want
to
make
him
suffer
more
or
less
is
it
necessary
to
answer
i
asked
hardly
but
i
have
to
impress
upon
you
that
it
partly
in
those
hands
of
yours
which
you
would
off
for
him
the
full
immensity
of
his
guilt
need
never
come
out
it
not
intended
that
it
should
come
out
still
if
you
are
going
to
treat
me
like
the
dirt
under
your
feet
the
man
who
will
soon
be
your
sister
husband
and
kick
up
a
scandal
i
sha
lie
still
i
not
a
saint
if
you
mean
to
fight
against
me
with
diana
or
anybody
else
or
even
set
people
talking
by
your
behaviour
by
jove
i
hit
back
i
sha
take
much
trouble
to
do
my
part
in
keeping
the
secret
you
bound
to
keep
it
are
you
i
suggested
government
want
it
to
come
out
that
the
attitude
at
present
but
when
relations
have
been
definitely
and
permanently
smoothed
over
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
it
wo
so
much
matter
except
for
march
himself
in
any
case
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
i
not
such
a
blunderer
but
i
tell
you
frankly
i
can
influence
others
to
keep
the
secret
after
the
time
limit
up
or
i
can
refrain
from
using
influence
which
shall
it
be
is
it
peace
or
war
between
us
i
stopped
to
think
for
a
moment
and
then
i
answered
it
an
armed
truce
we
have
all
heard
quite
a
lot
about
the
mouse
who
saved
a
lion
but
it
was
only
one
mouse
out
of
a
world
crammed
full
of
mice
i
never
heard
in
the
whole
history
of
mice
since
those
which
cain
and
abel
maybe
had
for
pets
of
another
mouse
capable
of
saving
any
animal
whatever
even
itself
still
there
remains
that
one
heroic
and
intelligent
mouse
when
sidney
vandyke
had
left
me
to
think
things
over
i
envied
it
with
passion
feeling
that
i
was
not
even
of
the
mouse
tribe
i
felt
more
like
a
fly
if
you
can
imagine
a
fly
cursed
with
a
human
heart
who
loves
an
eagle
that
has
been
shot
in
the
wing
and
caged
and
the
cage
set
down
on
the
seashore
when
the
night
tide
is
coming
in
what
could
such
a
fly
do
but
cling
sadly
to
the
cage
and
buzz
and
let
the
great
rush
of
water
drown
it
with
the
eagle
even
that
fly
seemed
more
fortunate
than
i
was
as
i
pictured
it
to
myself
for
it
was
privileged
to
rest
on
the
eagle
cage
i
could
not
be
near
my
wounded
eagle
five
days
after
that
awful
thursday
night
a
letter
from
di
told
me
that
her
engagement
had
changed
all
her
plans
sidney
was
very
impatient
and
wanted
to
be
married
soon
the
moment
his
work
was
over
at
el
paso
he
would
get
long
leave
and
possibly
he
might
make
up
his
mind
to
resign
from
the
army
that
was
what
she
wanted
him
to
do
and
when
she
had
him
with
her
she
knew
that
she
could
persuade
him
for
he
really
very
keen
on
soldiering
and
she
live
in
england
at
least
half
the
year
round
this
part
was
for
the
future
to
decide
but
in
any
case
there
would
be
the
long
leave
it
would
give
time
for
the
wedding
and
the
honeymoon
she
had
set
her
heart
on
being
married
at
george
for
it
was
the
historic
thing
to
do
and
there
was
the
trousseau
kitty
main
on
giving
it
to
her
for
a
wedding
present
which
was
rather
a
weight
off
one
mind
as
america
had
cost
something
in
spite
of
everybody
being
so
hospitable
and
good
kitty
would
go
to
paris
with
her
and
help
to
choose
the
things
which
would
be
nicer
than
having
just
a
sum
down
and
going
alone
so
they
di
and
kitty
and
father
had
all
decided
to
cut
out
the
rest
of
the
visits
arranged
and
make
for
home
california
had
been
great
fun
and
di
wished
she
might
stop
longer
but
one
could
have
one
cake
and
eat
it
too
being
married
was
her
cake
this
was
her
mistake
as
i
have
said
before
she
had
always
had
both
major
vandyke
work
in
el
paso
was
to
bear
witness
against
eagle
march
in
the
which
would
come
on
almost
at
once
and
i
was
to
go
away
without
hearing
the
verdict
or
seeing
eagle
after
all
was
over
di
had
written
to
dalziel
too
it
appeared
and
milly
was
only
too
glad
of
an
excuse
to
escape
from
the
the
place
where
captain
society
had
been
the
first
and
only
attraction
for
her
now
that
tony
time
is
so
dreadfully
taken
up
she
said
to
her
mother
he
ca
give
us
any
fun
or
have
any
fun
with
us
himself
so
we
might
as
well
go
away
dear
let
clear
out
and
take
peggy
to
meet
lady
di
and
the
others
at
albuquerque
where
we
can
get
into
the
and
join
them
i
do
know
what
tony
will
say
wavered
dalziel
who
was
finding
el
paso
rather
hot
in
those
days
for
plump
people
she
looked
at
me
so
did
milly
then
milly
laughed
no
good
pretending
we
got
cotton
wool
over
our
eyes
she
exclaimed
ca
you
make
up
your
mind
to
take
my
poor
dear
little
brother
peggy
and
put
him
out
of
his
misery
tony
and
i
understand
each
other
already
i
said
do
you
oh
i
glad
so
pleased
they
both
cried
together
and
i
had
to
explain
in
a
violent
hurry
before
i
had
been
caressed
under
false
pretences
that
there
are
understandings
understandings
tony
and
mine
was
the
kind
of
understanding
which
left
us
both
perfectly
free
the
kind
of
understanding
where
you
did
make
up
your
mind
but
just
waited
to
see
whether
it
made
itself
up
is
there
anything
between
you
and
the
poor
boy
then
implored
the
boy
mother
only
a
kiss
i
said
one
on
a
cheek
my
cheek
well
that
something
she
sighed
at
least
it
was
when
i
was
a
girl
it
was
not
much
to
me
though
it
might
have
been
to
a
better
regulated
flapper
i
could
dwell
on
such
trifles
as
kisses
i
thought
only
of
the
coming
chapter
xiii
the
understanding
remained
statu
whatever
that
means
the
expression
was
his
between
tony
and
me
when
dalziel
and
milly
and
i
turned
our
backs
on
el
paso
we
had
a
night
at
albuquerque
which
made
me
homesick
for
past
days
because
the
hotel
where
we
stopped
had
the
name
of
alvarado
i
had
known
that
i
was
happy
at
the
springs
but
in
looking
back
it
seemed
as
though
i
must
have
been
without
a
care
milly
and
her
mother
bought
wonderful
indian
curios
and
gorgeous
mexican
opals
and
silver
spoons
set
with
turquoises
at
albuquerque
and
milly
was
almost
feverishly
gay
but
i
guessed
that
at
heart
if
she
had
an
organ
worth
the
name
she
was
nearly
as
wretched
as
i
for
she
had
failed
and
she
had
let
the
venom
of
her
spite
poison
her
nature
trying
to
tell
herself
that
she
rejoiced
because
of
eagle
misfortunes
and
that
it
was
very
good
as
things
turned
out
to
be
free
of
him
and
his
fate
no
one
can
really
be
happy
with
such
poison
in
the
veins
and
there
ca
possibly
be
enjoyment
from
revelling
in
another
misfortunes
underneath
my
fury
when
milly
said
little
veiled
spiteful
things
about
captain
march
was
pity
for
her
the
kind
of
pity
you
have
for
an
irritable
invalid
who
snaps
when
father
and
main
and
diana
di
in
great
beauty
came
to
albuquerque
on
the
limited
and
we
three
took
up
our
quarters
in
staterooms
on
board
milly
dalziel
and
di
struck
up
a
great
friendship
almost
as
if
they
were
new
acquaintances
who
had
just
been
introduced
and
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
unexpectedly
charming
qualities
this
was
quite
funny
because
milly
had
found
it
hard
work
to
be
civil
to
di
at
alvarado
springs
and
di
had
been
rather
contemptuously
amused
at
milly
badly
disguised
jealousy
now
with
eagle
march
eliminated
from
the
scheme
of
life
for
both
of
them
each
discovered
that
the
other
was
a
delightful
creature
milly
accounted
to
me
for
her
change
of
mind
by
exclaiming
i
do
think
lady
di
has
got
heaps
prettier
since
she
went
to
california
do
you
and
she
just
as
sweet
as
she
pretty
perhaps
it
being
engaged
to
the
man
she
loves
that
has
made
the
difference
and
no
wonder
with
such
a
gorgeous
lover
as
major
vandyke
he
something
to
be
proud
of
even
for
a
beauty
and
a
like
your
sister
di
accounted
for
the
change
in
mind
by
saying
to
me
i
do
know
what
you
done
to
that
dalziel
girl
peggy
but
you
seem
to
have
made
her
all
over
she
used
to
be
a
cat
now
she
quite
a
darling
and
if
you
ever
sensible
enough
to
marry
tony
i
shall
love
to
have
such
a
fascinating
i
asked
her
to
be
one
of
my
bridesmaids
i
suppose
changing
your
mind
often
is
a
good
clean
thing
for
your
soul
just
as
changing
your
clothes
is
for
your
body
we
had
a
few
hours
to
flash
round
chicago
in
a
motor
car
seeing
pretty
parks
and
a
great
lake
like
the
sea
with
wonderful
buildings
along
its
shore
and
a
sky
like
a
painting
by
turner
i
was
bitterly
disappointed
not
to
get
the
telegram
tony
had
promised
to
send
addressed
to
the
blackstone
hotel
where
it
had
been
arranged
beforehand
that
we
should
lunch
and
dine
the
was
to
have
been
held
on
the
eighth
day
after
eagle
march
arrest
the
day
before
our
arrival
in
chicago
and
meanwhile
i
had
lived
only
for
the
telegram
my
impatience
to
know
the
worst
or
best
had
been
like
a
flame
in
my
blood
and
brain
when
it
was
time
to
take
the
fast
train
to
new
york
in
the
evening
and
no
telegram
had
come
it
seemed
as
if
that
flame
gave
a
devouring
leap
and
then
went
out
leaving
my
body
a
shell
the
next
morning
we
were
in
new
york
where
dalziel
met
his
wife
and
milly
i
hoped
that
he
might
have
read
some
news
of
el
paso
in
the
morning
papers
and
that
he
would
spring
it
upon
us
in
the
railway
station
where
we
paused
being
charming
and
affectionate
to
each
other
and
making
plans
to
meet
again
before
our
party
sailed
i
could
have
questioned
him
to
save
my
life
any
more
than
i
could
have
cried
out
in
fearful
nightmares
which
i
remembered
when
the
earth
was
about
to
swallow
me
up
or
a
mountain
fall
on
to
my
head
surely
i
thought
if
there
were
news
about
the
it
would
be
interesting
enough
to
the
dalziel
family
for
the
man
to
mention
it
if
only
because
tony
was
to
be
a
witness
in
the
case
but
the
affair
might
have
been
more
remote
from
us
all
than
a
destructive
tidal
wave
in
china
judging
by
dalziel
oblivion
of
it
he
and
father
talked
about
our
luck
in
grabbing
cabins
at
short
notice
on
the
his
wife
and
main
discussed
getting
seats
for
that
night
at
great
play
which
had
come
on
at
a
theatre
in
new
york
his
daughter
and
diana
chatted
about
the
earliest
date
when
milly
could
persuade
her
mother
to
sail
for
england
i
longed
to
scream
at
them
oh
you
hard
unfeeling
but
instead
i
stood
outwardly
patient
a
good
young
girl
with
a
little
mincing
smile
on
my
face
only
the
smile
was
frozen
so
hard
you
could
have
knocked
it
off
with
a
hammer
we
were
going
to
kitty
main
flat
which
she
called
her
apartment
and
the
dalziels
were
going
to
their
house
but
it
was
not
to
be
a
regular
parting
we
were
to
dine
with
them
somehow
the
idea
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
dear
dalziel
wanted
naughty
peggy
to
see
what
lovely
surroundings
might
be
hers
as
tony
wife
all
of
us
were
to
lunch
next
day
at
delmonico
as
kitty
guests
the
dalziels
were
to
motor
us
over
to
long
island
for
a
glimpse
of
their
country
place
there
and
they
were
to
see
us
off
on
the
but
that
would
not
be
until
five
days
had
passed
meanwhile
there
would
be
time
for
telegrams
and
even
letters
from
el
paso
at
last
after
all
the
noisy
planning
of
things
to
do
the
two
parties
contrived
to
tear
themselves
from
one
another
and
we
got
away
from
the
wonderful
station
in
main
motor
car
which
had
come
to
meet
us
a
most
impressive
motor
car
which
needed
only
a
coronet
or
at
worst
a
crest
on
its
door
perhaps
however
judging
from
present
signs
that
lack
might
be
supplied
later
her
apartment
was
in
a
marvellously
ornate
a
huge
brown
block
like
a
plum
cake
for
a
titan
tea
party
which
would
have
made
buckingham
palace
or
any
other
royal
residence
in
europe
look
a
toy
it
was
in
the
highest
story
according
to
kitty
the
most
desirable
because
you
had
all
the
air
there
and
none
of
the
noise
just
like
living
on
a
mountain
with
a
lift
to
the
top
i
wondered
what
she
would
think
of
poor
old
ballyconal
when
she
came
to
see
it
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
wire
my
temporary
address
to
tony
and
hate
myself
because
i
had
done
it
before
until
i
met
father
and
di
i
did
know
where
we
were
to
stay
in
new
york
for
everything
had
been
settled
through
letters
and
telegrams
with
as
little
useful
information
as
possible
if
i
had
remembered
in
chicago
that
tony
had
no
idea
where
i
would
be
in
new
york
there
need
have
been
no
more
delay
in
my
getting
the
news
but
something
seemed
to
be
strangely
wrong
at
his
end
of
the
line
for
even
when
there
had
been
time
for
him
to
get
my
telegram
and
send
another
no
answer
came
nothing
arrived
for
di
either
but
apparently
she
was
expecting
no
wire
she
must
have
had
some
human
curiosity
if
not
anxiety
to
know
the
fate
of
a
man
who
had
been
as
much
to
her
as
eagle
march
had
been
but
she
was
thinking
of
his
trial
i
suppose
entirely
from
sidney
vandyke
point
of
view
and
she
had
no
uneasiness
as
to
the
result
for
sidney
as
for
the
papers
though
i
quite
cleverly
managed
to
find
other
things
than
football
news
i
could
discover
nothing
about
the
on
captain
march
i
had
to
tell
myself
that
perhaps
they
did
put
such
affairs
in
newspapers
for
i
was
too
ignorant
to
think
of
trying
to
hunt
up
the
army
and
navy
official
journals
we
had
been
three
days
in
new
york
in
great
heat
which
kitty
took
pains
to
tell
us
was
most
unseasonable
when
one
morning
a
thunderstorm
accompanied
by
terrific
wind
came
up
preventing
us
from
going
out
as
we
had
intended
kitty
floor
at
the
top
of
the
building
with
its
steel
supports
actually
gave
the
effect
of
swaying
in
the
blast
like
an
overgrown
spear
of
wheat
a
phenomenon
kitty
took
as
a
matter
of
course
so
we
britishers
had
to
do
the
same
no
matter
how
we
felt
to
show
that
we
were
as
brave
as
americans
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
the
ring
sounded
reassuringly
as
if
to
say
that
we
were
not
cut
off
from
earth
and
a
calm
maid
used
to
hanging
on
insectlike
by
her
antennæ
to
the
top
grain
on
the
wheat
stalk
quietly
presented
a
silver
tray
with
letters
to
her
mistress
one
for
dear
diana
kitty
announced
picking
up
a
large
and
monogrammed
envelope
such
as
sidney
vandyke
had
made
peculiarly
his
own
and
i
had
only
time
for
a
heartbeat
before
she
added
two
for
little
peggy
i
never
much
relished
being
patronized
as
little
peggy
by
my
stepmother
but
she
might
safely
have
called
me
anything
from
a
pterodactyl
to
a
hippopotamus
just
then
i
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
uppermost
envelope
of
the
two
as
she
doled
the
letters
out
in
a
flash
i
knew
that
eagle
march
had
written
to
me
just
to
save
the
scarlet
flag
my
cheeks
flung
out
from
father
stare
i
pretended
great
interest
in
the
other
envelope
it
had
been
addressed
to
me
by
tony
my
letter
is
from
sidney
i
thought
i
should
have
one
from
him
said
di
with
the
brazen
boldness
of
the
legitimately
engaged
girl
who
has
a
right
to
expose
her
feelings
now
he
tell
me
perhaps
when
he
will
be
able
to
get
leave
and
follow
us
she
proceeded
to
tear
open
the
envelope
in
the
ruthless
violating
way
of
which
i
could
never
be
guilty
except
with
a
soulless
circular
a
letter
from
a
lover
or
a
friend
full
of
thoughts
and
touched
by
a
dear
hand
is
too
sacred
for
such
usage
fearing
from
di
expression
that
she
would
be
capable
of
reading
aloud
choice
selections
from
major
version
of
events
i
simply
could
stay
to
risk
hearing
them
i
jumped
up
and
fled
with
my
two
prizes
locked
safely
in
my
room
delicately
i
cut
the
edge
of
eagle
envelope
i
was
on
the
point
of
drawing
out
the
letter
which
appeared
to
be
meagrely
thin
when
something
within
me
seemed
to
faint
reading
what
he
had
to
say
i
should
know
in
a
very
few
words
i
was
sure
the
fate
to
which
he
looked
forward
there
would
be
no
working
up
no
preamble
to
prepare
my
mind
i
was
strong
enough
to
bear
it
i
should
have
to
take
tony
letter
first
like
a
dose
of
sal
volatile
dear
dear
peggy
my
benevolent
billiken
addressed
me
and
as
i
read
the
thunder
rolled
like
the
drums
of
fort
alvarado
or
el
paso
this
is
my
first
real
letter
to
you
for
i
do
count
notes
and
i
wish
it
could
be
a
better
one
i
afraid
you
must
be
pretty
mad
about
not
getting
a
telegram
at
chicago
or
anyhow
at
main
when
taken
all
the
trouble
to
wire
me
your
address
but
it
was
intimated
to
all
of
us
concerned
that
we
were
to
telegraph
news
about
know
to
our
families
or
friends
and
that
we
were
even
to
be
discreet
about
our
letters
i
been
so
indiscreet
with
you
on
that
subject
already
on
a
night
however
that
the
latter
bit
of
fatherly
instruction
does
hold
good
in
my
case
only
before
telling
you
what
i
have
to
tell
i
just
take
the
liberty
of
reminding
you
once
again
of
your
promise
to
keep
mum
till
gabriel
trumpet
sounds
or
till
i
take
off
the
embargo
is
that
the
way
to
spell
it
i
wonder
and
what
exactly
does
it
mean
as
matters
look
at
present
one
thing
is
liable
to
happen
about
the
same
time
as
the
other
well
now
i
going
to
tell
you
news
of
the
as
best
i
can
i
no
great
shakes
at
telling
things
you
know
vandyke
was
as
you
say
in
your
truly
british
fashion
the
day
appointed
for
the
trial
and
as
he
was
the
principal
witness
it
had
to
be
put
off
for
hours
you
have
thought
it
would
be
march
if
anybody
who
was
on
the
sick
list
would
you
but
he
was
all
right
in
health
i
do
know
what
was
the
matter
with
vandyke
except
that
i
happened
to
hear
our
old
doc
say
he
had
a
temperature
way
up
in
maybe
it
was
stage
fright
i
felt
like
that
myself
queer
all
over
when
the
time
came
as
a
fellow
does
when
he
just
going
to
be
seasick
the
was
what
you
call
a
which
can
be
convened
when
forces
are
on
active
service
as
of
course
we
are
now
though
we
had
nothing
very
active
to
do
except
on
a
certain
night
none
of
us
will
forget
and
on
army
day
when
we
all
marched
and
sweated
to
give
the
populace
an
impressive
show
a
field
general
can
try
cases
just
as
grave
as
a
general
can
and
its
proceedings
are
conducted
with
more
secrecy
it
consists
of
not
less
than
three
officers
none
of
them
under
the
rank
of
captain
but
the
president
of
the
court
may
be
a
general
officer
a
colonel
or
in
this
case
which
was
considered
very
important
both
on
account
of
march
fine
record
and
the
necessary
secrecy
that
had
to
be
maintained
we
had
the
general
commanding
the
fort
for
president
and
the
other
two
officers
of
the
court
were
a
colonel
and
a
major
i
do
think
you
met
either
of
them
when
you
were
here
so
their
names
would
interest
you
the
courtroom
was
just
a
plain
ordinary
room
in
the
barracks
at
fort
bliss
but
there
was
a
map
or
copy
of
and
regulations
hanging
on
the
yellowish
white
walls
that
i
ca
see
now
whenever
i
shut
my
eyes
i
guess
they
were
all
photographed
on
my
retina
as
the
writing
folks
say
the
three
officers
were
in
full
uniform
to
do
honour
to
the
case
and
of
course
there
was
a
man
present
dressed
in
all
were
army
chaps
even
to
the
headquarters
clerk
who
took
notes
of
the
proceedings
the
orderly
who
kept
the
door
and
the
witnesses
there
were
many
of
those
i
was
one
of
the
principal
witnesses
and
heard
from
me
before
how
little
i
had
to
say
march
who
as
prisoner
had
to
be
formally
conducted
in
by
an
officer
had
a
seat
on
the
left
of
the
judges
table
and
his
friend
major
dell
sat
beside
him
if
you
could
have
been
a
fly
on
that
beastly
wall
looking
down
at
your
hero
i
guess
you
have
been
proud
of
the
way
he
held
himself
if
he
been
brought
there
to
receive
a
medal
of
honour
instead
of
to
be
tried
for
a
big
insane
sort
of
offence
calculated
to
bring
about
international
complications
he
could
have
had
a
prouder
bearing
and
he
was
even
pale
he
looked
just
brown
and
calm
and
natural
i
had
to
confess
to
when
you
asked
me
a
question
that
night
in
the
park
that
i
was
all
muddled
up
in
my
mind
about
his
conduct
in
ordering
the
gunfire
i
did
know
whether
he
gone
off
his
chump
or
been
fooled
or
what
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
i
felt
proud
of
him
as
a
man
and
as
my
superior
officer
when
i
saw
the
way
he
bore
himself
for
his
trial
i
do
know
now
the
rights
of
the
matter
any
more
than
i
did
then
in
spite
of
the
court
findings
but
something
tells
me
as
girls
say
that
march
to
a
black
mystery
in
this
and
i
do
see
how
it
ever
going
to
be
cleared
up
as
things
are
but
to
go
back
to
the
march
was
accused
by
the
prosecutor
of
having
fired
without
orders
three
charges
from
field
guns
into
a
country
living
at
peace
with
the
united
states
to
the
detriment
of
its
inhabitants
and
property
and
to
the
imminent
peril
of
disturbing
international
relations
he
could
have
objected
legally
to
any
of
the
judges
and
stated
his
objections
but
he
did
object
to
them
nor
to
the
whom
he
had
a
right
to
throw
out
if
he
could
show
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
man
was
likely
to
be
partial
in
his
notes
of
the
proceedings
of
course
i
as
a
mere
witness
was
present
all
the
time
but
i
know
what
took
place
because
i
heard
some
of
it
from
different
quarters
i
know
that
when
court
had
been
duly
sworn
the
accused
was
arraigned
which
means
that
the
president
read
out
the
charges
against
march
and
asked
him
whether
he
pleaded
guilty
or
not
guilty
ca
you
just
hear
march
answering
steadily
in
that
pleasant
quiet
voice
of
his
guilty
the
next
thing
to
follow
was
the
prosecutor
address
outlining
the
case
against
the
prisoner
and
mentioning
the
witnesses
he
meant
to
summon
then
he
called
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
and
that
where
as
i
heard
from
other
witnesses
those
present
got
their
first
big
surprise
naturally
there
been
no
end
of
whispering
among
those
in
the
know
before
the
court
met
and
it
was
discussed
whether
or
not
march
would
bring
into
his
defence
the
state
of
feeling
between
vandyke
and
himself
some
thought
he
would
be
justified
in
doing
so
and
quixotic
not
to
as
the
bad
blood
between
them
and
the
cause
of
it
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
saying
this
was
already
a
sort
of
open
secret
others
argued
that
if
the
were
once
lugged
in
the
name
of
the
lady
concerned
and
other
details
would
certainly
be
dragged
into
the
case
through
inquiries
which
would
have
to
be
made
and
that
march
was
the
man
to
run
such
a
risk
even
if
it
were
likely
to
do
him
any
good
the
surprise
of
the
court
came
when
vandyke
accused
march
of
giving
the
order
for
firing
the
guns
without
authority
but
deliberately
putting
the
responsibility
on
him
vandyke
with
the
object
of
ruining
him
did
you
ever
know
the
like
of
that
from
one
way
of
looking
at
the
thing
it
was
a
jolly
smart
way
for
vandyke
to
turn
the
tables
because
it
would
take
all
the
wind
out
of
march
sails
in
case
he
meant
to
accuse
vandyke
of
the
same
intention
toward
him
i
do
suppose
there
ever
was
such
a
queer
case
between
officers
as
this
one
both
men
highly
placed
and
popular
in
the
service
and
society
i
believe
march
brought
out
his
notebook
in
evidence
the
one
with
his
monogram
on
it
in
silver
which
i
often
seen
and
which
you
say
you
gave
him
to
show
the
newly
leaf
and
his
friend
major
dell
who
was
his
classmate
at
west
point
seen
him
here
cavalry
chap
suggested
that
the
page
underneath
should
be
examined
with
a
magnifying
glass
for
the
impression
of
writing
on
the
missing
page
with
a
blunt
pencil
which
had
borne
heavily
on
the
paper
no
words
could
be
definitely
made
out
even
with
the
magnifier
and
even
if
they
could
have
been
i
afraid
that
would
have
made
much
difference
in
the
case
march
had
had
the
notebook
in
his
possession
after
the
gunfiring
you
see
and
could
easily
have
written
what
he
liked
and
then
torn
out
the
leaf
vandyke
orderly
being
dead
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
the
part
he
had
played
for
either
side
but
i
suppose
he
would
have
been
a
witness
for
the
prosecution
so
his
disappearance
off
the
scene
was
perhaps
a
good
thing
for
march
i
was
called
for
the
defence
but
nothing
i
had
to
say
was
of
any
good
i
felt
that
and
being
keen
to
serve
interest
if
i
could
with
truth
put
such
a
strain
on
me
to
be
careful
of
each
word
that
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
after
i
was
released
when
my
evidence
was
read
over
they
always
do
that
to
every
witness
before
he
leaves
the
court
it
seemed
to
me
i
given
the
most
rotten
answers
every
time
but
i
could
have
made
them
any
better
if
i
tried
to
explain
them
away
or
amend
them
as
i
should
have
had
the
right
to
do
so
i
let
them
go
as
they
were
march
me
himself
about
the
distance
he
was
from
the
guns
when
the
orderly
was
supposed
to
come
up
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
nature
of
the
ground
for
muffling
the
sound
of
footsteps
he
did
seem
a
bit
disgusted
or
hurt
with
me
because
i
could
not
do
better
for
his
case
he
had
a
real
friendly
look
in
his
eyes
whenever
they
met
mine
and
i
tell
you
peggy
i
could
have
blubbed
like
a
kid
when
i
thought
of
it
later
after
i
knew
what
the
verdict
was
once
i
saw
him
cross
glances
with
vandyke
and
if
you
wo
think
getting
sentimental
on
top
of
all
the
rest
i
tell
you
i
thought
march
look
was
like
a
sword
vandyke
was
yellow
and
bloodshot
as
if
he
had
a
bilious
attack
and
perhaps
bile
had
been
the
trouble
when
he
went
on
sick
report
and
the
case
had
to
be
delayed
for
him
the
findings
were
considered
in
closed
court
and
now
you
must
take
this
one
bit
of
comfort
to
yourself
peggy
in
your
trouble
about
your
friend
captain
march
things
might
have
gone
a
lot
harder
for
him
than
they
did
in
such
a
serious
case
vandyke
accusation
against
him
was
mighty
bad
and
there
was
some
evidence
to
support
it
march
did
seem
to
use
such
weapons
as
he
had
to
hit
back
with
quite
as
smartly
as
he
might
have
done
though
that
was
no
doubt
in
his
determination
to
keep
your
sister
name
from
coming
into
the
affair
he
did
defend
himself
to
the
extent
of
saying
he
tried
to
save
the
situation
by
firing
blank
instead
of
shell
but
that
did
help
him
much
for
the
whole
point
of
the
accusation
against
him
was
that
he
had
had
no
right
to
fire
at
all
none
of
his
witnesses
could
help
him
any
more
than
i
could
whereas
vandyke
had
several
who
took
their
oath
to
seeing
him
in
the
auto
with
his
orderly
leaving
old
fort
bliss
at
much
about
the
time
when
march
said
johnson
came
to
him
with
the
second
verbal
order
march
could
have
been
sentenced
to
imprisonment
or
chucked
out
of
the
army
if
the
court
had
believed
in
his
giving
the
order
to
fire
the
guns
on
his
own
responsibility
out
of
sheer
madness
or
spite
against
vandyke
as
it
was
they
accepted
the
theory
that
he
had
been
hoaxed
by
some
one
unknown
purporting
to
be
the
orderly
of
major
vandyke
then
acting
as
colonel
owing
to
the
comparative
darkness
of
the
night
luckily
there
was
a
moon
only
stars
it
would
have
been
possible
for
a
nervous
jumpy
man
to
mistake
the
identity
of
a
person
masquerading
as
another
person
now
know
and
know
and
everybody
who
knows
him
knows
march
is
the
last
fellow
in
the
world
to
get
nerves
or
jumps
in
any
circumstances
whatever
all
the
same
giving
him
credit
for
them
on
a
night
when
a
mexican
raid
on
the
town
had
been
predicted
offered
the
court
an
excuse
to
let
the
accused
down
lightly
he
was
sentenced
merely
to
censure
for
rashness
and
carelessness
etc
in
sequence
to
this
our
old
man
the
colonel
i
mean
has
had
to
advise
march
to
resign
that
part
of
the
programme
and
equally
it
is
part
of
the
programme
that
march
should
take
the
advice
now
dear
i
told
you
the
story
as
well
or
as
badly
as
i
can
anyhow
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
and
that
is
a
good
deal
more
than
you
ought
to
know
or
others
are
likely
to
know
if
you
hear
anything
further
it
will
be
from
march
himself
when
the
mexican
bees
have
settled
down
in
their
hive
again
and
back
at
fort
alvarado
i
going
to
have
a
good
try
for
a
month
leave
or
longer
so
as
to
cross
the
blue
with
the
mater
and
sis
of
course
entirely
with
the
object
of
looking
after
them
and
perhaps
getting
an
invitation
to
lady
di
wedding
and
not
a
bit
for
the
sake
of
seeing
you
or
jogging
your
memory
about
a
certain
decision
yours
till
the
end
of
beyond
billiken
for
a
while
after
i
had
read
this
long
letter
through
to
the
accompaniment
of
thunder
lightning
and
rain
i
sat
with
the
four
closely
written
sheets
of
paper
in
my
hand
not
thinking
only
feeling
i
could
not
console
myself
with
the
one
bit
of
comfort
which
tony
waved
under
my
eyes
eagle
march
was
a
born
soldier
he
cared
more
for
his
career
than
for
his
life
and
it
had
been
taken
from
him
though
the
world
was
not
to
know
what
he
was
accused
of
doing
all
the
world
would
know
that
he
had
left
the
army
because
his
country
no
longer
needed
his
services
and
he
owed
this
to
his
love
for
my
sister
this
was
what
diana
and
i
had
brought
upon
the
bravest
and
best
man
we
should
ever
meet
what
will
he
do
what
will
become
of
him
i
asked
myself
miserably
and
the
rain
beating
on
the
window
seemed
to
give
a
desolating
answer
but
there
was
still
the
letter
i
had
waited
to
read
until
i
learned
the
best
or
worst
from
tony
perhaps
that
would
tell
me
what
i
wished
to
know
chapter
xiv
eagle
march
letter
was
characteristic
though
he
must
have
felt
as
if
he
stood
alone
at
the
place
of
the
world
he
had
more
to
say
about
me
than
of
himself
he
had
read
in
the
el
paso
papers
that
i
was
going
to
sail
for
england
and
all
the
first
part
of
his
letter
was
concerned
with
bon
voyage
it
was
only
in
the
last
paragraph
that
he
mentioned
his
own
affairs
you
have
heard
already
he
said
of
what
has
happened
to
me
had
a
blow
but
i
not
going
to
lie
down
under
it
there
must
be
work
for
me
somewhere
and
when
i
found
it
you
hear
from
me
again
not
until
then
though
for
i
rather
hard
hit
and
might
be
inclined
to
grumble
but
i
shall
think
of
you
constantly
and
i
do
believe
if
i
wrote
a
volume
i
could
make
you
understand
how
much
the
thought
will
help
i
shall
wear
it
like
armour
not
a
word
of
diana
but
i
read
between
the
lines
he
was
rather
hard
hit
just
when
he
was
facing
an
attack
from
the
front
she
had
stabbed
him
in
the
back
in
one
way
the
letter
was
a
bitter
disappointment
for
i
had
longed
to
be
told
eagle
plans
yet
in
the
hint
that
i
should
hear
again
when
he
had
found
work
there
was
a
thrill
like
that
which
comes
with
martial
music
i
was
far
from
guessing
then
what
that
work
would
be
and
how
quickly
and
surprisingly
he
would
find
it
but
vaguely
i
felt
that
there
was
only
one
kind
of
work
worth
eagle
march
while
soldier
work
because
i
must
expect
to
hear
that
did
not
prevent
my
writing
from
the
ship
this
is
i
said
always
i
be
looking
forward
to
great
things
for
you
and
you
may
laugh
but
i
in
earnest
i
shall
live
in
the
hope
of
you
in
the
world
eyes
the
day
may
come
i
believe
it
will
the
best
day
of
my
life
when
the
passed
liberty
i
sent
back
a
last
message
by
the
statue
to
eagle
till
the
day
i
said
but
it
was
a
pang
to
see
the
last
of
her
i
went
down
to
my
stateroom
and
cried
oh
how
i
cried
as
if
to
flaunt
the
glorious
difference
between
this
summer
and
last
father
took
a
furnished
house
in
norfolk
street
hyde
park
which
was
to
let
with
the
owner
servants
it
was
very
rich
looking
though
the
elaborate
decorations
reminded
me
of
houses
in
plays
father
was
able
to
splurge
on
di
prospects
and
probably
kitty
main
contributed
to
the
expense
for
she
and
her
maid
came
to
stay
with
us
we
began
to
be
expensively
gay
and
i
believe
if
any
duke
or
earl
who
tangoed
with
diana
had
offered
himself
for
the
dance
of
life
she
would
have
thrown
over
sidney
vandyke
at
the
eleventh
hour
but
no
one
exciting
showed
signs
of
entangling
himself
permanently
and
so
when
major
vandyke
wired
that
the
situation
in
mexico
permitted
him
to
ask
for
leave
di
engagement
was
announced
in
the
soon
after
this
sidney
arrived
with
cartloads
of
luggage
which
seemed
to
detach
him
from
america
forever
he
had
got
long
leave
and
intended
to
resign
from
the
army
at
the
end
of
it
he
took
up
his
quarters
at
the
savoy
hotel
but
he
was
at
our
house
morning
noon
and
night
and
though
everybody
who
saw
him
for
the
first
time
said
how
handsome
he
was
it
struck
me
from
the
minute
we
met
that
he
had
changed
for
the
worse
he
looked
older
and
stouter
and
black
and
white
would
no
longer
express
him
in
a
picture
a
suffusion
of
red
for
the
face
as
well
as
for
the
lips
under
the
black
moustache
would
have
been
needed
i
wondered
if
he
were
drinking
and
though
when
he
lunched
or
dined
with
us
he
was
always
careful
except
with
champagne
which
he
loved
as
a
child
loves
sweets
he
might
be
less
cautious
when
out
of
sight
at
first
i
could
hardly
bear
to
sit
down
at
the
same
table
with
sidney
vandyke
but
as
time
went
on
i
found
an
impish
pleasure
in
watching
him
in
staring
openly
as
a
baby
stares
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
he
was
disturbed
by
my
gaze
and
that
he
knew
even
when
not
looking
that
my
eyes
were
on
him
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
talk
he
would
break
down
and
forget
what
he
had
meant
to
say
next
i
affected
him
with
a
kind
of
aphasia
erasing
the
words
he
wanted
from
his
brain
but
otherwise
my
tactics
were
changed
i
was
no
longer
rude
to
my
future
i
wished
to
study
him
and
i
did
object
to
his
knowing
that
i
studied
him
a
silent
battle
was
being
fought
between
us
under
a
smooth
surface
of
civility
and
sidney
might
easily
have
complained
to
diana
that
my
owl
stare
was
getting
on
his
nerves
even
though
he
could
have
brought
no
other
complaint
if
he
had
spoken
to
her
she
would
have
made
some
excuse
to
scratch
me
off
her
list
of
bridesmaids
i
hoped
she
would
and
save
me
trouble
but
perhaps
sidney
felt
that
i
was
yearning
for
him
to
squeal
and
resolved
not
to
please
me
in
any
case
nobody
not
in
the
secret
of
our
hearts
could
have
guessed
that
anything
was
wrong
and
i
had
to
play
at
spraining
my
ankle
in
order
to
escape
being
one
of
the
eight
it
was
well
to
be
civil
in
word
and
deed
and
bide
my
time
but
to
be
in
at
the
death
and
marry
my
sister
to
a
man
who
stolen
her
from
eagle
march
and
ruined
him
was
a
different
thing
i
drew
the
line
at
that
it
quite
simple
for
a
girl
vowed
to
the
conscientious
life
and
no
fibs
to
wrench
her
ankle
if
she
wear
high
heels
all
she
has
to
do
when
walking
in
the
street
is
to
look
out
for
banana
peel
or
an
apple
paring
may
do
at
a
pinch
she
launches
herself
upon
it
with
a
skating
movement
her
foot
turns
and
the
deed
is
done
she
can
in
this
way
produce
a
strain
if
not
a
sprain
and
only
doctors
know
the
difference
the
difficult
part
comes
in
remembering
to
limp
i
was
so
fearful
of
forgetting
in
some
moment
of
excitement
that
i
took
to
wearing
shoes
which
were
not
mates
they
were
actually
incompatible
one
had
a
louis
quinze
heel
and
the
other
had
none
at
all
but
my
dresses
by
this
time
were
so
grown
up
and
long
that
nobody
noticed
besides
though
refusing
to
see
a
doctor
i
stopped
in
bed
for
days
and
hypnotically
impressed
the
idea
of
a
sprain
on
every
one
those
who
did
know
why
i
would
for
the
world
be
bridesmaid
to
diana
sat
by
my
bedside
and
sympathized
among
others
dalziel
and
milly
who
had
followed
us
in
time
to
have
all
the
season
fun
in
london
before
the
wedding
tony
hoped
to
get
leave
and
arrive
for
the
great
day
afterward
he
and
his
mother
and
sister
planned
a
motor
tour
through
belgium
and
luxemburg
and
france
before
the
time
when
tony
must
rejoin
his
regiment
i
had
a
sneaking
idea
that
they
meant
me
to
go
too
but
at
that
moment
before
other
things
had
happened
i
told
myself
that
i
would
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
was
homesick
for
ireland
and
ballyconal
the
date
of
di
wedding
was
definitely
settled
until
after
sidney
came
then
it
was
fixed
for
the
ninth
of
july
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
were
to
have
four
weeks
motoring
in
the
north
of
england
when
the
honeymoon
was
officially
over
they
were
to
make
visits
in
scotland
for
the
shooting
season
sidney
vandyke
boasted
of
being
a
crack
shot
and
diana
hoped
to
be
proud
of
her
american
husband
among
british
sportsmen
meanwhile
they
had
some
time
before
the
wedding
in
which
to
find
a
town
house
and
choose
furniture
and
things
so
that
they
might
be
at
home
in
the
autumn
i
think
di
really
loved
sidney
the
day
he
consented
to
buy
a
house
a
very
expensive
though
small
house
in
park
lane
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
park
lane
for
you
see
there
was
always
something
rootedly
victorian
about
di
such
as
being
convinced
that
park
lane
was
the
mount
olympus
of
london
and
that
you
could
be
properly
married
except
at
george
she
was
and
is
only
on
the
surface
in
such
details
as
clothes
and
hats
and
tango
and
the
latest
slang
probably
di
had
never
been
so
happy
as
in
gathering
together
materials
for
her
future
frame
and
if
sidney
was
chagrined
because
father
offer
to
lend
for
the
honeymoon
our
ancestral
castle
to
which
he
and
di
had
frequently
alluded
in
america
he
kept
his
feelings
to
himself
he
would
have
been
twice
as
much
chagrined
by
the
castle
could
he
have
seen
it
before
kitty
main
got
in
her
deadly
work
the
trowbridges
of
chicago
would
have
rejoiced
to
tell
him
what
it
was
really
like
i
do
quite
know
why
it
is
the
fashion
for
brides
to
shut
themselves
up
and
not
go
out
for
days
before
the
wedding
but
perhaps
they
are
supposed
to
pass
their
close
time
in
prayer
and
maiden
meditation
thanking
heaven
for
what
it
has
provided
and
dwelling
on
the
responsibilities
of
the
future
di
spent
her
days
in
being
fitted
for
frocks
goodness
knew
who
would
pay
for
them
unless
sidney
on
ceasing
to
be
a
bridegroom
and
turning
into
a
husband
receiving
wedding
presents
having
photographs
taken
and
giving
discreet
interviews
to
journalists
she
told
the
male
ones
what
a
heroic
person
major
vandyke
was
and
to
the
female
ones
she
showed
her
dresses
there
was
an
illustrated
daily
or
weekly
paper
in
london
that
did
produce
a
picture
of
sidney
in
uniform
looking
dashing
and
di
looking
down
all
modesty
and
eyelashes
the
last
night
she
went
out
to
anything
big
before
the
wedding
was
to
a
dinner
at
the
russian
embassy
and
though
nothing
which
seemed
to
us
sensationally
interesting
happened
that
night
something
was
led
up
to
later
it
came
through
milly
dalziel
for
whom
father
and
di
had
contrived
to
get
an
invitation
she
met
captain
count
stefan
stefanovitch
the
military
attaché
of
the
russian
embassy
there
is
something
irresistible
to
some
natures
about
a
russian
count
and
to
russian
counts
about
american
heiresses
particularly
those
with
red
hair
when
the
two
had
seen
each
other
three
times
they
were
engaged
subject
to
the
consent
of
the
count
father
everybody
in
that
family
was
a
count
or
countess
a
delicious
prospect
for
milly
when
she
wished
to
talk
of
her
russian
relatives
stefan
was
to
stay
and
see
milly
in
her
bridesmaid
dress
then
he
was
going
to
make
a
dash
for
petrograd
we
called
it
petersburg
then
armed
with
her
photograph
and
substantial
accounts
of
her
father
bank
balance
returning
as
soon
as
the
consent
was
insured
there
seemed
to
be
something
almost
feudally
about
russians
milly
thought
for
a
mere
wire
to
father
had
been
considered
adequate
but
then
tony
senior
was
a
count
or
a
vitch
or
anything
exciting
like
that
it
was
after
this
dinner
that
i
began
to
prowl
for
banana
peel
i
wanted
to
be
premature
still
it
was
necessary
to
give
some
other
girl
time
to
get
a
bridesmaid
dress
just
then
the
only
thing
in
london
that
anybody
cared
about
was
the
russian
opera
and
ballet
and
it
occurred
to
di
that
it
would
be
original
to
clothe
her
eight
attendant
maidens
in
léon
bakst
designs
most
of
the
girls
were
pale
blondes
whom
she
had
chosen
because
they
would
form
an
effective
contrast
to
herself
but
they
were
very
brave
about
the
bakst
effects
the
measure
of
their
fingers
had
been
taken
and
they
were
expecting
presents
of
rings
beautiful
enough
to
console
them
for
worse
disasters
besides
sidney
had
brought
over
from
america
a
captain
beatty
to
be
his
best
man
he
was
rather
rich
and
very
during
all
this
time
of
our
new
popularity
i
had
heard
nothing
of
eagle
march
except
that
he
had
turned
his
back
on
his
native
land
after
resigning
from
the
army
and
that
various
ugly
stories
were
in
circulation
it
was
even
said
that
he
had
been
bribed
by
mexico
with
immense
sums
of
money
to
betray
his
country
it
was
tony
who
wrote
me
this
in
answer
to
a
question
but
he
knew
no
more
than
this
gossip
not
even
when
he
arrived
in
london
the
day
before
diana
wedding
for
all
i
can
tell
he
said
when
he
had
congratulated
me
on
my
limp
march
may
have
offered
himself
and
his
aeroplane
to
the
viceroy
of
india
or
the
sultan
of
turkey
or
even
the
emperor
of
japan
there
only
one
thing
certain
about
him
he
have
to
be
a
soldier
somewhere
somehow
blessed
is
the
bride
the
sun
shines
on
they
say
but
the
sun
did
not
shine
on
diana
the
ninth
of
july
dawned
gray
and
blustering
with
a
queer
rasping
chill
in
the
air
like
an
autumn
day
slipped
back
in
the
calendar
i
hated
the
thought
of
seeing
di
married
to
sidney
vandyke
it
seemed
like
aiding
and
abetting
the
enemy
but
unless
i
had
another
accident
at
the
last
minute
such
as
falling
downstairs
i
could
see
no
way
of
stopping
at
home
without
a
row
what
would
eagle
want
me
to
do
i
asked
myself
it
was
almost
as
if
i
could
hear
his
voice
saying
do
hurt
diana
on
such
a
day
by
stopping
away
from
her
wedding
i
decided
to
be
there
and
it
was
arranged
for
me
to
sit
with
kitty
main
dalziel
and
tony
i
did
mind
this
because
tony
very
well
propose
in
church
with
the
voice
that
breathed
eden
resounding
to
the
roof
the
wedding
was
fixed
for
two
at
george
hanover
square
and
if
any
were
left
in
london
who
did
know
the
hour
and
all
other
details
it
must
have
been
because
they
did
read
the
halfpenny
papers
it
had
even
been
announced
that
one
of
the
bridegroom
many
magnificent
presents
to
the
bride
would
be
a
car
in
which
lady
diana
vandyke
would
drive
from
the
church
with
her
husband
to
the
house
of
her
father
for
the
wedding
reception
and
go
on
for
the
honeymoon
tour
afterward
this
paragraph
was
truer
than
some
of
the
others
but
the
day
before
the
wedding
the
car
had
yet
been
delivered
by
the
makers
a
frantic
telegram
from
sidney
brought
the
assurance
that
he
might
count
without
fail
on
its
arriving
by
ten
next
day
at
latest
the
firm
regretted
deeply
the
unforeseen
delay
which
had
occurred
owing
to
a
strike
but
the
automobile
had
been
shipped
still
sidney
and
diana
were
anxious
kitty
and
dalziel
and
tony
and
i
started
rather
late
for
kitty
had
superintended
the
bride
dressing
the
other
two
came
for
us
in
a
motor
car
but
dalziel
had
to
stop
for
a
look
at
di
as
for
me
i
not
sure
how
i
felt
about
my
sister
she
was
so
lovely
in
her
lace
and
silver
brocade
gown
and
her
that
my
eyes
clung
to
her
yet
it
was
hateful
that
her
beauty
should
be
for
sidney
vandyke
my
thoughts
flew
to
eagle
wherever
he
might
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
perhaps
and
i
wondered
if
he
knew
what
was
happening
in
london
our
places
at
church
were
at
the
front
in
one
of
the
pews
reserved
for
the
bride
relatives
and
intimate
friends
so
our
being
late
matter
but
already
the
back
part
of
the
church
was
full
and
the
air
heavy
with
the
perfumes
women
wore
and
the
fragrance
of
roses
and
lilies
which
made
the
decorations
as
we
went
in
a
sense
of
suffocation
gripped
me
i
felt
as
if
i
could
easily
faint
and
i
realized
that
the
long
strain
on
my
nerves
had
begun
to
tell
i
had
a
queer
impression
that
i
was
only
a
body
and
that
my
soul
was
far
away
looking
for
some
one
it
could
not
find
i
was
glad
when
we
were
settled
in
our
seats
but
still
the
odour
of
the
flowers
oppressed
me
i
fancied
that
the
brooding
gloom
of
the
day
would
end
in
a
thunderstorm
people
were
whispering
and
rustling
in
their
seats
wondering
if
it
were
not
almost
the
time
for
the
bride
music
to
begin
i
had
a
jumpy
sensation
that
somebody
behind
me
must
be
staring
and
strongly
willing
me
to
look
round
always
i
have
been
sensitive
to
that
kind
of
influence
and
often
too
i
tried
to
make
others
feel
it
i
kept
turning
my
head
but
could
see
no
one
who
seemed
to
be
taking
an
undue
interest
in
me
presently
however
i
caught
tony
eyes
which
fixed
themselves
on
mine
in
an
owlish
stare
what
makes
you
keep
on
twisting
round
like
that
he
inquired
in
a
stage
whisper
are
you
looking
for
any
one
in
particular
no
o
i
said
but
i
have
a
funny
sort
of
feeling
as
if
some
one
were
looking
for
me
by
jove
exclaimed
tony
and
repressed
himself
at
a
glare
from
his
mother
i
wonder
if
it
possible
he
stopped
and
began
carefully
to
smooth
his
silk
hat
which
was
poised
on
his
knee
if
what
possible
i
wanted
to
know
bending
my
head
near
to
his
regardless
of
somebody
plume
which
grazed
my
eye
oh
er
nothing
much
only
just
a
silly
idea
of
mine
tell
me
and
let
me
judge
whether
it
silly
or
not
you
rousing
my
curiosity
and
all
the
while
i
tingled
with
that
almost
irresistible
desire
to
turn
my
head
again
it
was
as
if
i
were
missing
something
very
important
i
rather
not
now
said
tony
i
tell
you
afterward
before
i
had
time
to
wheedle
the
mystery
out
of
him
as
i
felt
confident
i
could
the
wedding
march
from
lohengrin
struck
up
of
course
diana
have
that
it
went
with
george
and
the
rest
of
it
the
historic
thing
she
came
up
the
aisle
her
hand
on
father
arm
oh
does
he
look
murmured
kitty
main
he
i
murmured
back
lord
ballyconal
but
dear
diana
is
wonderful
of
course
her
wondrousness
was
largely
a
tribute
to
kitty
who
had
given
the
bride
everything
she
had
on
everything
that
was
packed
away
in
her
trunks
at
home
or
laid
out
ready
to
go
away
in
it
all
passed
off
exactly
like
any
other
wedding
on
a
grand
scale
except
that
tony
sitting
by
my
side
drew
a
long
breath
when
the
bishop
who
was
marrying
diana
to
sidney
vandyke
finished
the
conventional
pause
following
or
else
forever
after
hold
his
peace
i
flashed
another
glance
at
tony
but
he
was
looking
more
like
an
imperturbable
billiken
than
he
had
ever
looked
and
so
di
was
married
and
people
whispered
what
a
beautiful
bride
and
how
the
american
bridegroom
was
while
she
and
sidney
were
in
the
vestry
signing
their
names
in
the
book
then
down
the
aisle
they
came
di
radiant
major
vandyke
flushed
and
brilliant
eyed
he
looks
as
if
he
had
just
fought
a
successful
engagement
i
heard
an
american
man
in
the
pew
behind
say
to
his
wife
well
that
was
exactly
what
he
had
done
but
whether
according
to
the
rules
of
war
or
not
was
another
question
we
let
the
crowd
pour
out
of
the
church
before
us
and
followed
at
leisure
i
feeling
more
depressed
than
i
should
at
a
funeral
automobiles
and
carriages
were
dashing
up
to
the
pavement
to
take
people
away
and
dashing
off
again
after
an
instant
pause
while
throngs
of
the
uninvited
and
curious
pressed
close
on
either
side
of
the
red
carpet
rain
was
falling
but
the
appeared
to
care
little
the
people
seemed
more
excited
than
usual
at
a
wedding
we
thought
especially
after
the
passing
of
the
bride
and
tony
and
i
looked
at
each
other
questioningly
with
raised
eyebrows
as
we
caught
a
word
here
and
there
might
been
a
tragedy
pretty
close
call
that
was
if
it
had
been
for
that
feller
they
both
have
been
dead
corpses
now
remarked
the
uninvited
what
can
have
happened
we
asked
each
other
and
i
made
tony
speak
to
the
policeman
who
had
shut
us
into
our
car
bride
carriage
sir
but
it
was
soon
all
right
in
the
end
was
the
only
answer
we
got
as
the
signal
was
given
for
our
motor
to
move
off
and
the
next
to
come
up
the
bride
carriage
then
the
new
automobile
had
come
and
there
had
been
an
accident
at
the
church
door
chapter
xv
we
dashed
home
to
get
news
of
diana
and
it
was
a
relief
to
find
everything
decorous
and
apparently
serene
at
the
house
we
were
informed
by
a
band
of
footmen
hired
with
powder
and
pomatum
inclusive
for
the
occasion
that
the
bride
had
arrived
safely
there
was
no
stare
of
consternation
or
horror
on
any
face
but
in
the
with
its
effective
marble
pillars
di
and
father
had
taken
the
house
on
the
strength
of
that
so
well
designed
for
a
wedding
reception
the
bride
and
bridegroom
had
not
yet
stationed
themselves
to
smile
and
be
congratulated
although
guests
had
begun
to
arrive
father
however
was
there
at
his
best
and
reassuring
everybody
diana
had
been
a
little
upset
by
the
fright
do
you
know
and
vandyke
was
looking
after
her
but
it
was
nothing
nothing
at
all
she
would
be
down
presently
what
is
it
father
what
did
happen
i
found
a
chance
to
whisper
but
to
my
surprise
he
gave
me
for
answer
only
a
frown
which
seemed
inexplicably
to
say
whatever
it
is
better
not
ask
pretend
innocence
it
does
suit
you
do
find
out
something
from
somebody
i
said
hastily
to
tony
and
ran
upstairs
in
search
of
kitty
main
who
having
deserted
us
to
return
home
with
father
was
nevertheless
not
to
be
found
in
the
she
was
sure
to
know
everything
i
thought
and
delighted
to
talk
but
the
first
person
i
met
was
sidney
vandyke
in
the
act
of
closing
diana
door
and
coming
out
into
the
hall
seeing
me
a
set
and
gloomy
expression
most
unsuitable
to
a
bridegroom
changed
to
a
look
of
actual
fury
if
i
had
been
a
small
tame
dog
which
had
unexpectedly
sprung
up
to
bite
him
he
could
not
have
glared
more
venomously
since
he
had
come
to
london
we
had
met
almost
every
day
and
when
necessary
i
had
been
as
dully
polite
as
a
book
on
etiquette
but
only
when
necessary
at
other
times
i
had
effaced
myself
now
though
i
was
keen
for
news
of
di
i
did
care
to
get
it
from
him
especially
after
that
look
never
since
the
episode
of
the
photograph
in
camp
at
el
paso
had
i
of
my
own
free
will
begun
a
conversation
with
major
vandyke
and
it
was
now
my
intention
to
wait
until
he
was
out
of
the
way
before
going
to
kitty
or
diana
but
when
i
would
quietly
have
slid
past
the
bridegroom
in
the
corridor
he
stopped
me
you
always
been
the
enemy
he
said
in
a
tone
of
repressed
rage
subdued
to
reach
my
ears
only
but
i
did
think
you
fought
fair
i
did
expect
you
to
hit
me
in
the
back
and
strike
your
sister
too
on
her
wedding
day
you
a
cruel
and
cowardly
little
enemy
after
all
and
let
me
tell
you
this
neither
of
us
will
forgive
you
as
long
as
we
live
i
stared
at
him
in
amazement
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
should
lie
on
top
of
the
rest
if
i
were
you
he
sneered
i
forbid
you
to
go
to
di
she
borne
enough
a
little
more
and
she
not
be
able
to
face
those
people
downstairs
i
tell
you
again
and
i
do
lie
because
eagle
march
himself
taught
me
to
speak
the
truth
i
said
that
i
no
idea
what
you
driving
at
i
have
done
nothing
except
live
i
do
know
what
happened
i
want
to
know
you
sha
have
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
anything
from
me
sidney
flung
the
words
at
my
head
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
opened
diana
door
again
without
knocking
i
think
he
would
have
shut
it
in
my
face
but
kitty
main
was
ready
to
come
out
and
must
have
had
her
hand
on
the
knob
when
it
was
snatched
from
her
fingers
oh
major
she
exclaimed
i
was
hurrying
to
call
you
back
di
thinks
she
strong
enough
to
go
down
now
the
door
remained
open
and
i
saw
di
sitting
on
a
sofa
just
opposite
with
an
empty
champagne
glass
in
her
hand
her
white
face
and
white
figure
in
her
wedding
dress
stood
out
like
a
wonderfully
painted
portrait
against
the
fashionable
black
chintz
of
the
bedroom
seeing
her
husband
she
stood
up
and
came
forward
setting
the
wineglass
on
the
table
as
she
passed
i
all
right
now
she
said
and
then
caught
sight
of
me
oh
cruel
she
reproached
me
was
it
who
asked
you
not
to
tell
or
was
it
your
own
thought
he
i
echoed
you
all
talk
in
riddles
you
accuse
me
of
something
and
wo
explain
what
it
is
you
know
di
exclaimed
but
i
ca
talk
about
it
now
or
i
shall
break
down
again
thanks
for
the
champagne
sid
you
were
right
it
did
me
good
now
we
go
she
brushed
past
me
in
the
corridor
her
head
turned
away
and
as
i
stared
stupidly
after
her
and
major
vandyke
suddenly
my
eyes
fell
on
a
small
but
conspicuous
spot
of
red
that
marred
the
lustre
of
di
silver
train
it
looked
like
a
drop
of
blood
when
the
two
had
gone
i
pounced
upon
main
for
pity
sake
explain
the
mystery
oh
it
was
dreadful
for
a
few
minutes
she
said
there
was
nearly
the
most
accident
of
course
you
came
out
too
late
to
see
but
you
know
who
was
in
the
at
least
i
suppose
he
must
have
been
there
i
started
as
if
she
had
boxed
my
ears
for
without
telling
i
knew
all
she
meant
i
remembered
the
odd
feeling
i
had
had
of
some
one
trying
to
call
me
as
if
in
a
dream
and
how
i
had
looked
behind
me
in
vain
tony
too
had
been
very
strange
he
had
begun
to
say
something
and
had
stopped
in
haste
he
had
promised
to
explain
later
but
coming
home
i
had
forgotten
to
ask
him
there
had
been
the
excitement
about
the
supposed
accident
to
diana
and
my
thoughts
had
clung
to
that
now
i
realized
that
there
was
only
who
might
have
been
at
george
with
my
secret
connivance
whose
presence
there
sidney
vandyke
would
furiously
resent
eagle
march
kitty
was
looking
at
me
curiously
almost
appealingly
and
i
was
vexed
with
myself
for
blushing
i
do
not
know
i
answered
steadily
i
might
guess
but
almost
surely
i
should
guess
wrong
tell
me
who
in
all
that
crowd
it
was
worth
sidney
while
to
make
this
fuss
about
well
said
kitty
who
being
far
from
brave
is
easily
abashed
i
not
sure
he
inside
the
church
but
anyhow
he
was
because
i
saw
him
the
instant
before
he
seized
the
horses
heads
and
then
seized
the
horses
heads
but
who
who
captain
march
of
course
it
was
he
who
saved
diana
and
major
vandyke
at
least
i
think
he
deserves
so
much
credit
and
di
would
think
it
too
if
she
were
left
to
herself
but
major
vandyke
says
the
whole
thing
was
arranged
that
it
was
captain
march
who
planned
to
to
he
sure
to
say
something
horrible
but
begin
at
the
beginning
i
ca
now
dear
said
kitty
nervously
di
and
sidney
will
be
so
cross
if
i
stay
up
here
talking
to
you
i
really
must
go
down
but
you
sure
to
hear
everything
i
did
insist
for
i
could
not
keep
her
against
her
will
and
besides
it
would
be
better
to
have
the
story
from
some
one
who
could
tell
things
more
clearly
down
i
flew
to
find
tony
whom
i
could
trust
to
have
commandeered
some
news
for
me
by
this
time
already
the
was
crammed
with
perfumed
people
and
too
fragrant
flowers
and
a
babel
of
chatter
i
should
have
had
to
knock
fat
old
ladies
and
thin
old
gentlemen
about
like
ninepins
to
sort
out
from
among
bonneted
and
bald
pates
the
inconspicuous
brown
head
i
sought
and
my
search
was
checked
constantly
by
creatures
who
pined
to
tell
me
how
pretty
the
wedding
had
been
or
how
much
i
had
grown
since
they
saw
me
last
now
and
then
however
i
picked
up
a
wisp
of
information
what
a
close
shave
there
was
of
a
tragedy
but
all
well
that
ends
well
said
lady
a
distant
cousin
of
ours
who
had
ignored
the
connection
until
it
advertised
itself
in
norfolk
street
and
park
lane
who
was
the
man
who
seized
the
horses
heads
when
they
bolted
i
see
him
myself
but
i
heard
some
one
say
he
looked
like
a
gentleman
i
answered
as
if
i
had
the
whole
affair
at
my
fingers
ends
it
was
captain
march
of
the
american
army
the
flying
man
who
used
to
be
so
popular
here
last
summer
dear
me
breathed
lady
who
had
two
sons
of
her
own
in
the
british
army
why
i
heard
gerald
speaking
of
him
only
the
other
day
he
heard
that
captain
march
had
been
cashiered
for
something
or
other
so
it
could
be
spoken
of
the
story
going
the
rounds
of
london
now
i
not
sure
gerald
did
get
it
from
your
the
night
he
asked
major
vandyke
to
dine
at
the
rag
how
strange
captain
march
should
have
been
the
one
to
save
them
he
was
not
cashiered
i
passionately
protested
he
did
nothing
dreadful
it
was
i
stopped
myself
on
the
verge
of
saying
that
it
was
sidney
vandyke
himself
who
deserved
to
bear
the
shame
he
would
thrust
on
another
but
there
are
some
things
you
can
not
do
one
of
these
is
to
inform
a
guest
at
your
sister
wedding
that
the
bridegroom
is
a
villain
i
had
to
choke
back
my
rage
against
sidney
at
its
hottest
like
vesuvius
swallowing
its
own
lava
and
resolve
to
fight
the
battle
of
eagle
march
only
on
the
lines
of
the
lines
on
which
he
would
choose
to
fight
no
matter
what
the
provocative
at
last
i
unearthed
tony
talking
to
the
prettiest
bridesmaid
but
because
she
was
the
prettiest
and
other
men
were
glad
to
snap
her
up
i
disentangled
tony
with
ease
i
been
dying
for
you
i
said
i
do
flatter
myself
too
much
on
that
he
replied
it
my
story
you
want
well
i
been
busy
putting
things
together
and
i
guess
only
the
two
ends
of
the
that
are
missing
now
i
warn
you
peggy
i
do
know
how
eagle
march
got
into
church
or
where
from
or
what
became
of
him
at
the
end
perhaps
i
shall
hear
from
him
i
said
yet
i
spoke
mechanically
and
with
little
hope
i
felt
that
the
time
eagle
had
fixed
for
our
meeting
was
not
yet
perhaps
you
will
echoed
tony
he
may
want
to
explain
when
he
knows
know
he
was
there
why
he
turned
up
at
lady
di
wedding
that
it
was
just
vulgar
curiosity
or
the
wish
to
give
her
a
start
that
made
him
do
it
he
would
need
to
explain
to
you
or
me
or
any
one
who
knew
him
i
answered
that
goes
without
saying
whatever
his
reason
was
it
was
good
but
are
you
sure
he
was
in
the
church
well
you
remember
when
i
asked
why
you
kept
turning
your
head
and
you
told
me
it
was
because
you
felt
some
one
for
you
yes
and
you
said
jove
i
wonder
if
it
possible
then
you
shut
up
like
an
oyster
i
thought
it
would
do
to
go
further
then
and
excite
you
for
nothing
maybe
i
did
promise
to
tell
you
afterward
but
coming
here
we
had
the
accident
to
talk
about
and
you
forgot
never
mind
excuses
tell
me
now
had
you
seen
him
i
was
quite
sure
thought
i
might
have
made
a
mistake
away
back
near
the
door
as
we
came
in
i
caught
sight
of
a
chap
who
reminded
me
of
march
but
i
never
saw
him
before
in
london
togs
you
know
and
it
was
dark
in
the
church
with
all
that
rain
coming
down
outside
i
tell
for
certain
it
seemed
so
dashed
improbable
that
he
should
be
there
even
if
he
was
in
london
he
would
have
been
likely
to
get
a
card
a
card
indeed
do
you
think
any
one
with
eyes
in
his
head
would
ask
eagle
march
to
show
a
well
anyhow
tony
defended
himself
why
should
he
want
to
poke
his
nose
in
there
i
judged
him
by
the
way
should
feel
supposing
it
was
you
being
spliced
to
some
other
fellow
i
sooner
be
at
the
north
or
south
pole
than
have
to
watch
it
done
unless
i
could
bounce
out
with
an
impediment
why
you
should
lawfully
be
joined
together
i
can
think
of
reasons
why
a
man
might
might
steel
himself
to
see
a
woman
he
loved
married
to
another
man
i
said
though
in
truth
i
could
see
distinctly
and
i
wondered
if
the
day
would
come
when
the
mystery
of
eagle
presence
at
diana
wedding
would
clear
itself
up
there
was
just
one
thing
i
could
count
on
though
it
would
never
be
from
my
trying
to
find
out
but
only
when
and
if
eagle
wished
me
to
know
meanwhile
i
trusted
him
as
always
and
hardly
needed
to
be
told
that
the
man
in
the
back
seat
at
george
had
flaunted
himself
in
a
conspicuous
position
he
was
wedged
in
between
two
women
hats
tony
went
on
i
never
have
spotted
him
if
i
had
been
at
the
crowd
sort
of
counting
scalps
that
not
done
by
brides
and
grooms
in
our
class
of
life
so
march
might
have
felt
as
safe
as
a
hermit
crab
as
far
as
giving
the
willies
to
lady
di
or
vandyke
was
concerned
but
just
when
i
was
rubbering
he
happened
to
shove
his
head
forward
between
hats
to
squint
at
you
oh
tony
i
could
help
breaking
in
he
was
looking
at
that
the
way
it
struck
me
but
the
ladies
with
the
hats
were
after
the
same
thing
so
they
closed
their
ranks
in
front
of
march
nose
and
swamped
him
that
why
i
did
get
the
chance
to
make
sure
whether
it
was
he
or
his
double
i
rubbered
some
more
to
see
but
there
was
only
a
massed
formation
of
hats
where
the
face
had
been
there
nothing
like
hatpins
to
drive
a
man
to
the
wall
i
shivered
a
little
with
the
same
electric
thrill
which
had
passed
through
me
in
church
what
a
soulless
thing
i
had
been
not
to
know
despite
a
barrier
of
a
hundred
hats
by
instinct
whose
eyes
had
called
mine
but
tony
was
going
mildly
on
that
all
about
the
church
he
said
march
must
have
been
one
of
the
first
to
get
out
or
he
would
have
been
on
the
stage
in
time
for
the
next
act
sounds
like
a
kind
of
melodrama
now
does
it
act
one
scene
one
inside
george
hanover
square
the
wedding
scene
two
outside
the
church
door
only
in
a
melodrama
the
bridegroom
would
be
the
hero
and
the
other
fellow
the
villain
there
no
villain
in
this
play
oh
there
i
sneered
we
wo
argue
the
question
though
i
suppose
the
new
motor
car
did
come
after
all
as
i
hear
things
about
runaway
horses
then
you
have
heard
already
what
the
good
of
my
repeating
no
no
i
heard
scarcely
anything
i
depended
on
you
i
was
sure
you
would
fail
me
that
encouraged
tony
and
soon
i
knew
what
he
knew
he
had
been
pumping
captain
beatty
and
had
learned
from
him
how
before
leaving
the
savoy
for
george
sidney
had
received
a
wire
from
his
chauffeur
it
said
that
the
had
safely
arrived
by
a
later
train
than
promised
but
that
something
was
wrong
with
the
motor
better
not
depend
on
the
car
for
church
though
it
would
be
pretty
sure
to
be
all
right
to
go
away
in
after
the
reception
this
was
a
blow
to
sidney
because
he
had
grown
quite
superstitious
on
the
subject
of
reaching
the
house
from
george
he
had
told
captain
beatty
about
repeated
dreams
of
a
bomb
startling
a
pair
of
horses
and
a
bond
street
clairvoyant
had
seen
in
her
crystal
a
picture
of
him
and
a
woman
in
white
driving
away
from
a
church
in
a
hearse
captain
beatty
had
mentioned
casually
to
tony
that
vandyke
used
to
have
as
good
nerves
as
the
next
man
but
that
he
got
jumpy
lately
and
beatty
wondered
whether
it
was
like
that
with
all
fellows
who
were
going
to
be
married
the
only
thing
to
do
had
been
to
order
a
motor
or
carriage
to
come
to
george
for
the
bride
and
bridegroom
di
appealed
to
by
telephone
preferred
a
carriage
a
one
had
been
sent
accordingly
but
the
horses
were
fresh
and
had
begun
to
dance
impatiently
even
before
diana
and
sidney
came
out
of
the
church
the
thin
little
coachman
had
difficulty
in
holding
them
in
when
it
thundered
by
the
time
di
and
her
husband
appeared
the
pair
were
prancing
on
their
hind
legs
and
the
crowd
on
the
pavement
waiting
for
the
bridal
couple
were
pushing
nervously
back
out
of
the
way
of
threatening
hoofs
di
had
hesitated
for
an
instant
but
the
coachman
had
assured
major
vandyke
that
the
horses
were
only
playing
a
bit
and
were
as
gentle
as
lambs
come
down
to
business
the
minute
they
were
allowed
to
start
so
sidney
had
put
diana
into
the
carriage
and
was
in
the
act
of
getting
in
himself
when
a
man
on
a
motor
cycle
suddenly
tore
round
the
corner
into
hanover
square
with
the
noise
of
ten
thousand
demons
that
was
the
limit
for
the
horses
said
tony
they
bolted
with
di
shrieking
and
trying
to
pull
her
husband
into
the
brougham
sidney
clinging
ignominiously
to
the
door
and
to
a
strap
inside
the
policeman
and
another
man
or
two
ran
forward
but
the
screaming
of
diana
and
dozens
of
women
on
the
pavement
frightened
the
creatures
more
and
more
the
coachman
lost
control
the
policeman
was
kicked
and
stumbled
back
the
others
could
get
to
the
horses
which
were
bolting
across
the
street
and
in
another
minute
the
bridegroom
would
certainly
have
been
flung
down
if
a
man
just
out
of
church
had
made
a
dash
to
the
rescue
the
next
thing
any
one
knew
he
was
hanging
on
to
the
animals
heads
like
grim
death
and
bringing
them
down
from
their
hind
feet
on
to
all
fours
again
he
was
dragged
a
few
yards
before
a
couple
of
policemen
could
get
to
his
side
but
meanwhile
as
he
clung
to
the
horses
like
a
brake
on
their
speed
the
brougham
steadied
itself
sidney
contrived
to
crawl
inside
and
bang
the
door
shut
for
his
own
protection
and
di
it
all
happened
in
a
minute
and
as
the
hatless
man
held
on
to
the
horses
heads
captain
beatty
in
great
astonishment
recognized
him
as
captain
march
it
was
eagle
who
stopped
the
horses
but
as
the
two
policemen
sprang
to
his
aid
and
staggering
back
he
let
go
his
hold
he
must
have
been
kicked
by
one
of
the
beasts
what
captain
beatty
did
see
was
eagle
forehead
streaming
with
blood
and
when
the
rescuer
had
hurried
away
insisting
that
the
wound
was
of
no
importance
the
bride
was
helped
out
of
the
carriage
by
the
bridegroom
and
into
a
closed
motor
car
which
some
one
hastily
offered
in
the
street
where
it
had
all
happened
was
a
stain
of
blood
captain
march
no
doubt
but
in
the
excitement
of
changing
the
bride
from
one
vehicle
to
the
other
he
had
time
to
vanish
as
completely
as
if
he
wrapped
himself
in
an
invisible
cloak
just
as
well
too
considering
who
he
was
and
who
he
saved
tony
finished
ungrammatically
it
would
have
been
mighty
awkward
for
all
parties
if
he
fallen
down
in
a
faint
and
lord
ballyconal
out
of
gratitude
had
had
to
put
him
up
here
where
the
wedding
party
going
on
or
even
if
he
been
all
right
but
coralled
by
the
crowd
the
bride
would
have
been
called
upon
to
address
him
as
preserver
what
ca
you
see
vandyke
obliged
to
shower
blessings
on
march
for
saving
both
their
lives
and
yet
how
awful
that
he
should
go
without
a
word
of
thanks
go
wounded
and
bleeding
the
thought
made
me
choke
i
guess
march
is
a
bit
like
a
sick
cat
that
way
said
tony
dryly
he
rather
crawl
off
and
get
well
alone
than
be
bothered
by
sympathy
even
yours
my
child
that
like
him
and
like
him
to
save
the
very
man
who
spoilt
his
life
but
blest
if
i
can
see
that
being
there
in
church
was
like
him
no
matter
what
you
say
anyhow
it
was
a
blamed
good
thing
for
every
one
concerned
that
he
just
dropped
from
heaven
like
manna
in
the
nick
of
time
and
then
was
absorbed
back
into
clouds
again
blood
and
all
diana
dress
must
have
been
baptized
in
that
blood
i
muttered
for
my
own
benefit
but
tony
caught
me
up
gee
did
she
get
her
gown
spattered
with
it
a
drop
or
two
on
her
silver
train
poetic
justice
the
blood
had
been
spilt
for
her
dashed
bad
luck
to
get
it
on
her
wedding
dress
though
i
heard
superstitious
folks
say
but
what
rotten
nonsense
to
talk
like
this
to
you
of
course
there
nothing
in
it
i
not
sure
how
di
would
feel
if
she
knew
but
feel
as
if
a
drop
of
eagle
march
blood
would
be
like
the
blood
of
the
prince
in
a
fairy
story
i
used
to
love
just
the
faintest
smear
of
it
brought
fortune
for
the
heroine
and
all
her
family
i
said
di
does
know
i
did
tell
what
i
saw
and
would
you
believe
this
tony
my
noble
pretends
to
believe
that
eagle
got
up
the
whole
scene
like
a
plot
in
that
melodrama
you
were
talking
about
i
suppose
he
like
di
to
think
that
eagle
bribed
the
livery
people
to
send
nervous
horses
and
a
weak
coachman
and
that
he
hired
a
motor
cyclist
to
swing
round
the
corner
on
a
cue
at
the
right
instant
in
order
that
he
himself
might
play
the
gallant
hero
rather
elaborate
but
that
shows
how
a
man
judges
another
by
what
he
would
do
in
his
place
is
it
a
proof
that
the
el
paso
affair
was
a
plot
a
plot
sidney
accuses
eagle
of
revenging
in
this
wild
way
that
quite
a
neat
suggestion
said
tony
smiling
an
smile
which
made
me
want
to
box
his
ears
though
not
hard
i
do
think
you
need
be
afraid
though
he
hurried
on
to
calm
me
vandyke
wo
openly
accuse
march
of
anything
more
i
guess
unless
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
where
it
wo
do
much
harm
if
he
dealt
out
any
talk
of
that
sort
he
make
himself
a
and
he
would
stand
for
that
he
just
try
to
forget
the
whole
business
and
help
other
folks
to
forget
cut
it
out
it
will
be
better
for
him
i
said
as
fiercely
as
a
small
dog
growling
in
the
kennel
of
a
big
one
but
di
and
sidney
too
both
accuse
of
being
in
the
they
say
i
knew
eagle
was
in
england
and
secretly
invited
him
to
the
wedding
i
have
even
heard
from
him
since
we
came
back
from
america
have
you
tony
face
brightened
well
i
shall
never
cease
wondering
what
brought
march
to
the
church
till
i
know
which
may
be
never
unless
you
tell
me
when
you
hear
i
hear
i
guess
you
sure
to
sooner
or
later
he
must
know
now
that
he
was
recognized
no
use
hiding
his
head
in
the
sand
he
want
to
explain
why
he
er
well
sort
of
intruded
no
he
would
need
to
explain
i
reiterated
what
the
use
of
friendship
if
it
does
understand
and
take
things
for
granted
and
if
eagle
never
writes
i
shall
know
he
does
want
me
to
seek
him
so
i
wo
do
that
even
though
he
has
been
hurt
for
us
and
maybe
is
suffering
you
a
soldier
tony
complimented
me
march
would
be
just
the
man
to
appreciate
that
if
he
could
hear
you
now
i
believe
he
would
understand
me
as
i
understand
him
i
said
still
it
is
hard
not
to
know
if
he
badly
hurt
by
the
way
he
shot
through
the
crowd
like
a
streak
of
greased
lightning
i
should
say
it
was
fatal
tony
cheered
me
but
if
like
to
have
me
do
a
bit
of
secret
service
work
and
to
a
few
hotels
or
hospitals
i
shook
my
head
decidedly
i
know
the
hotel
where
he
goes
i
said
i
sha
send
i
think
if
he
were
very
badly
wounded
he
let
me
know
he
trust
me
to
stand
between
him
and
the
others
now
let
go
and
see
di
cut
her
wedding
cake
you
can
have
a
piece
to
dream
on
if
you
like
no
good
said
tony
i
always
dream
of
you
anyhow
when
i
dream
at
all
except
when
i
eat
welsh
rabbit
then
i
dream
of
the
devil
but
he
went
with
me
like
a
lamb
and
we
spoke
no
more
of
captain
march
chapter
xvi
i
think
if
sidney
vandyke
had
never
taken
the
trouble
actually
to
hate
me
he
exerted
himself
to
that
extent
on
his
wedding
day
i
kept
my
distance
when
the
others
gave
the
bride
and
bridegroom
a
of
waving
hands
and
showering
rice
as
they
skimmed
away
in
the
car
ready
at
last
but
i
caught
a
wandering
glance
or
two
meanwhile
from
my
new
and
thanked
my
stars
that
heaven
had
made
me
some
poor
private
soldier
under
his
command
di
turned
her
cheek
with
the
look
of
a
martyred
saint
when
i
was
supposed
to
kiss
her
and
altogether
i
fancied
that
i
should
not
be
urged
to
visit
in
park
lane
when
the
happy
pair
came
back
in
the
autumn
i
intended
to
be
at
ballyconal
then
but
a
thousand
things
were
fated
to
change
my
scheme
and
the
schemes
of
all
the
other
unsuspecting
mice
in
england
and
europe
the
first
thing
oh
such
a
small
thing
compared
to
those
that
were
to
follow
which
happened
after
di
marriage
was
an
announcement
from
father
he
had
proposed
to
main
and
she
had
been
good
enough
to
accept
him
that
was
his
formal
way
of
breaking
the
news
to
me
for
we
had
been
on
official
terms
only
for
some
days
following
the
wedding
though
to
his
darling
di
he
would
probably
have
put
it
look
here
girl
she
jumped
at
me
hurrah
the
luck
of
ballyconal
come
right
side
up
again
and
di
would
have
congratulated
dear
old
bally
reminding
him
that
third
times
were
always
successful
of
course
whenever
i
stopped
to
think
of
it
i
had
told
myself
that
this
announcement
was
bound
to
come
and
to
come
soon
but
my
head
had
been
full
as
a
hive
of
bees
with
other
thoughts
and
besides
i
realized
how
i
should
feel
the
blow
when
it
fell
vaguely
i
taken
it
for
granted
that
life
would
go
on
for
me
as
before
i
liked
kitty
and
she
did
dislike
me
though
of
course
di
had
been
brilliantly
her
favourite
i
had
told
myself
that
kitty
and
father
would
trot
off
somewhere
and
leave
me
free
at
ballyconal
to
hibernate
in
some
neglected
corner
while
the
place
was
glorified
into
a
stately
british
home
for
an
american
millionairess
then
i
had
gone
on
dimly
planning
they
would
return
in
state
and
kitty
would
be
duly
honoured
by
a
picturesque
welcome
from
the
hastily
cleaned
up
tenants
after
that
nobody
would
take
much
notice
of
little
peggy
i
should
be
tacitly
permitted
to
play
among
my
books
and
the
peasants
i
loved
the
best
for
whose
sake
i
had
been
trying
to
learn
the
art
of
nursing
father
way
of
telling
his
news
however
showed
me
the
truth
about
myself
i
did
feel
in
the
least
related
to
him
and
i
decided
to
use
the
month
before
their
return
from
the
wedding
journey
in
finding
some
other
way
of
spending
my
life
i
could
make
a
crowd
in
that
company
of
two
i
was
nice
to
father
and
charming
to
kitty
and
all
the
time
i
was
polishing
my
brain
as
if
it
were
the
genie
lamp
and
summoning
the
genie
to
bring
me
inspiration
i
could
be
a
governess
on
the
strength
of
languages
alone
not
knowing
the
multiplication
table
having
to
do
hasty
sums
on
my
fingers
and
being
ignorant
of
principal
rivers
boundaries
and
all
dates
except
that
of
waterloo
was
too
big
a
handicap
and
in
sheer
poverty
of
invention
i
seemed
to
be
driven
back
to
billiken
that
god
of
things
as
they
ought
to
be
perhaps
it
was
fate
that
i
had
been
invited
by
dalziel
to
a
boy
and
girl
theatre
party
the
very
night
when
i
had
to
congratulate
father
and
wish
wishes
for
kitty
which
short
of
a
miracle
could
come
true
it
was
only
two
days
after
di
wedding
but
already
that
event
seemed
long
ago
no
news
had
come
from
eagle
and
he
was
referred
to
in
london
newspapers
as
the
modest
stranger
who
had
disappeared
after
saving
the
lives
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
leaving
no
trace
except
a
little
blood
shed
in
their
service
the
dinner
at
the
savoy
and
the
boy
and
girl
party
at
the
theatre
afterward
were
given
no
doubt
more
in
honour
of
milly
count
who
was
starting
for
petrograd
next
morning
than
for
me
but
i
was
made
to
feel
myself
a
guest
of
importance
and
at
the
james
i
had
tony
next
to
me
there
had
been
no
chance
to
pour
out
my
news
at
dinner
but
now
it
came
and
i
seized
it
instantly
tony
was
always
nice
and
sympathetic
to
tell
things
to
he
actually
listened
and
seemed
interested
which
i
noticed
that
few
people
do
except
in
their
own
affairs
but
the
next
minute
i
was
sorry
i
spoken
for
he
proposed
again
immediately
i
might
have
known
he
would
you
see
your
whole
family
bound
to
marry
americans
so
i
might
as
well
be
the
one
for
you
he
said
if
you
do
take
me
main
will
produce
a
nephew
of
hers
i
know
him
poisonous
blighter
and
he
be
shoved
down
your
throat
sure
as
fate
he
homelier
than
me
if
possible
i
laughed
dear
tony
you
much
too
good
to
be
a
refuge
for
the
destitute
depends
on
the
destitute
said
he
i
love
to
be
a
sort
of
asylum
or
young
ladies
home
for
you
do
take
me
this
time
and
have
done
with
it
once
and
for
all
it
would
be
done
with
i
reminded
him
that
the
worst
of
it
it
might
be
the
best
of
it
if
i
played
my
cards
right
you
know
peggy
not
very
long
ago
as
the
bird
of
time
flies
you
said
you
liked
me
better
than
any
other
fellow
has
my
stock
gone
down
or
stands
it
where
it
did
where
it
did
or
even
a
point
or
two
higher
i
assured
him
but
dear
tony
i
afraid
even
is
high
enough
for
for
marriage
and
fearfully
serious
things
like
that
though
lovely
for
a
dance
or
the
theatre
besides
i
did
say
what
you
think
i
said
about
liking
me
better
than
other
men
oh
i
know
you
made
one
exception
is
jolly
likely
i
forget
but
you
said
the
one
exception
did
count
i
have
forgotten
that
either
he
looked
on
you
as
his
sister
or
his
maiden
aunt
oh
his
maiden
aunt
i
moaned
i
could
bear
anything
but
that
and
and
i
afraid
after
all
he
count
just
in
my
mind
you
know
not
in
any
other
way
but
he
there
and
i
ca
ca
put
him
out
i
afraid
i
do
want
to
gee
that
a
bad
prospect
for
me
said
tony
with
a
big
sigh
luckily
not
audible
over
the
orchestra
which
was
loudly
playing
between
acts
you
made
me
love
you
i
did
want
to
do
it
with
variations
but
see
here
peggy
it
just
the
same
with
me
about
you
i
ca
put
out
of
my
mind
and
i
do
mean
to
there
you
are
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
this
your
best
man
wo
come
and
play
in
your
backyard
and
my
best
girl
wo
put
her
nose
in
mine
you
always
be
my
best
girl
because
you
the
best
girl
there
is
so
here
an
idea
suppose
i
do
ask
to
be
best
with
you
and
do
whine
to
be
on
the
ground
floor
or
anything
conceited
could
you
spare
me
a
back
bedroom
in
your
heart
house
just
sort
of
lend
it
to
me
you
know
i
promise
to
turn
out
if
you
could
get
along
with
me
as
a
boarder
when
given
me
a
fair
trial
of
course
though
dear
i
do
want
to
nag
at
you
if
there
a
grain
of
chance
that
the
best
man
the
real
tenant
of
the
house
will
ever
come
to
his
right
senses
his
right
senses
i
almost
laughed
why
tony
for
him
to
like
me
in
way
would
be
to
lose
them
you
do
know
who
he
is
tony
was
silent
or
you
have
you
been
guessing
may
have
guessed
right
grumbled
billiken
evasively
and
then
i
knew
that
he
knew
the
poor
little
secret
i
had
thought
to
keep
i
think
you
have
guessed
right
i
said
do
look
as
if
you
were
afraid
you
hurt
me
you
have
i
do
much
mind
your
knowing
and
that
the
greatest
compliment
i
could
pay
you
it
eagle
march
of
course
with
that
the
orchestra
stopped
dead
as
if
on
purpose
to
eavesdrop
and
i
had
made
a
present
of
the
name
to
the
whole
audience
but
luckily
that
was
all
i
had
given
any
girl
may
yell
any
man
name
just
as
any
cat
may
look
at
any
king
all
the
same
my
cheeks
were
hot
throughout
the
next
act
during
which
i
pretended
to
be
passionately
absorbed
in
the
play
the
minute
it
was
over
and
forced
silence
at
an
end
tony
boldly
said
i
knew
it
must
be
march
all
the
time
not
that
you
showed
it
he
hurried
to
add
you
too
good
plucked
an
infant
for
that
and
sure
he
never
twigged
not
he
he
not
that
kind
it
was
only
because
you
saw
a
lot
of
him
that
i
thought
so
and
a
girl
who
would
fall
head
over
ears
in
love
with
march
if
he
was
always
underfoot
have
wit
enough
to
know
which
side
her
bread
was
buttered
see
i
laughed
again
more
than
before
for
tony
when
he
meant
to
be
intensely
serious
was
generally
funny
poor
me
i
said
there
was
no
butter
on
my
bread
nor
any
jam
i
a
fool
to
go
on
eating
it
bare
and
stale
imagine
a
man
who
loved
di
anticlimaxing
over
to
me
i
ca
imagine
any
man
not
beginning
and
ending
with
you
said
tony
stoutly
and
i
should
have
been
a
human
girl
if
his
loyal
admiration
had
pleased
me
but
i
suppose
you
a
better
judge
of
march
than
i
am
he
went
on
and
so
if
his
name
not
down
on
the
programme
you
write
mine
there
to
be
figurative
again
scribble
it
in
pencil
if
you
like
not
in
ink
then
you
can
easily
rub
it
out
if
you
get
tired
of
seeing
it
always
under
your
eyes
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
really
puzzled
by
his
allegories
why
be
engaged
to
me
on
the
instalment
plan
stop
payment
whenever
you
want
to
agreement
to
be
drawn
up
that
way
all
these
weeks
you
been
trying
according
to
promise
have
you
to
like
me
enough
to
be
engaged
now
instead
try
engaged
and
see
whether
you
can
like
me
enough
to
strike
a
fast
bargain
by
and
by
you
might
come
along
to
belgium
with
mater
and
milly
and
me
they
dying
to
have
you
milly
wants
to
bore
you
talking
about
her
russian
and
we
see
such
a
lot
of
each
other
travelling
that
you
know
your
own
mind
by
the
time
my
leave
up
think
if
i
could
take
you
back
to
god
own
country
with
me
as
my
no
i
wo
say
the
word
i
see
it
shocks
you
it
does
i
said
and
even
if
i
did
what
you
ask
which
would
be
nice
for
me
but
not
fair
to
you
nothing
would
induce
me
to
to
marry
yes
so
soon
i
too
young
unless
i
loved
you
perfectly
then
marry
you
if
i
were
instead
of
eighteen
i
would
marry
you
must
draw
the
line
somewhere
but
if
you
really
think
it
would
be
nice
why
not
do
it
i
think
it
fair
and
i
the
judge
say
yes
quick
before
that
darned
orchestra
stops
again
you
sha
be
married
till
you
like
even
if
i
have
to
wait
as
long
as
jacob
did
for
rachel
not
that
i
know
how
long
that
was
say
yes
yes
then
i
shouted
over
an
appalling
blast
of
instruments
and
tony
squeezed
my
hand
that
is
how
i
happened
to
start
for
belgium
with
dalziel
and
milly
the
day
after
father
quiet
wedding
with
kitty
main
and
the
day
before
austria
delivered
her
ultimatum
to
servia
chapter
xvii
not
being
politicians
or
war
prophets
but
only
tourists
we
realize
what
a
flame
would
sweep
over
europe
on
the
winds
of
fury
from
this
one
fiery
spark
tony
read
us
out
the
news
at
breakfast
in
a
hotel
at
bruges
austria
ultimatum
to
servia
whereupon
we
went
on
drinking
our
coffee
and
eating
our
crisp
rolls
as
if
nothing
had
happened
dear
me
what
a
pity
sighed
dalziel
absently
she
was
thinking
of
our
expedition
for
which
we
were
already
late
milly
remarked
that
somebody
was
always
throwing
an
ultimatum
at
somebody
else
head
and
asked
for
jam
tony
said
intelligently
that
it
was
just
what
he
had
expected
after
the
murder
of
the
archduke
and
the
duchess
and
looked
at
his
watch
as
for
me
it
did
shoot
through
my
mind
that
russia
might
have
something
to
say
if
servia
were
attacked
and
i
thought
that
if
i
were
milly
i
should
have
a
qualm
of
anxiety
about
my
but
i
did
wish
to
worry
her
with
such
a
remote
suggestion
and
our
war
conversation
ended
there
none
of
us
bothered
seriously
with
the
papers
for
the
next
day
or
two
in
belgium
seemed
to
us
the
last
thing
on
earth
which
could
possibly
connect
itself
with
an
ultimatum
or
even
a
declaration
of
war
on
servia
we
went
from
bruges
to
ghent
from
ghent
to
antwerp
from
antwerp
to
brussels
from
brussels
to
namur
to
louvain
and
spa
and
so
at
last
arrived
at
liége
the
next
item
on
our
programme
was
a
run
into
luxemburg
which
was
to
finish
our
trip
and
in
a
few
days
more
tony
was
to
leave
us
to
catch
his
ship
for
home
as
his
holiday
was
over
he
had
been
behaving
so
well
that
i
minded
being
engaged
less
than
expected
and
it
was
nice
to
be
petted
by
milly
and
dalziel
and
loaded
with
presents
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
experienced
anything
of
the
sort
for
i
had
always
been
the
one
who
did
matter
at
home
each
place
we
visited
seemed
more
beautiful
than
the
last
and
i
was
trying
hard
to
say
to
myself
this
is
happiness
or
all
you
can
expect
to
know
make
the
most
of
it
and
be
a
sensible
peggy
it
was
late
on
the
night
of
wednesday
july
when
we
arrived
at
quaint
old
liége
and
though
we
knew
that
austria
had
declared
war
and
that
all
the
great
powers
were
muttering
thunderously
it
did
seem
as
if
anything
devastating
would
really
happen
that
was
much
too
bad
to
be
true
and
everything
seemed
so
peaceful
and
comfortable
hotel
keepers
smiled
and
said
that
the
war
scare
was
sure
to
blow
over
as
it
had
blown
over
time
after
time
in
the
past
we
met
other
people
gayly
touring
like
ourselves
they
all
appeared
to
be
easy
in
their
minds
and
free
from
care
so
we
followed
their
pleasant
example
and
the
sun
shone
on
us
and
belgium
seemed
the
prettiest
and
most
pacific
of
all
countries
basking
under
a
cloudless
sky
telegram
for
you
dear
dalziel
said
to
milly
as
she
sorted
the
post
handed
to
her
by
the
man
in
the
hotel
bureau
at
liége
then
she
dealt
out
envelopes
to
tony
and
me
and
we
were
rather
sleepily
busied
with
them
when
milly
gave
a
gasp
oh
mamma
he
got
to
she
squealed
he
who
questioned
dalziel
dazedly
in
the
midst
of
deciphering
a
closely
written
and
crossed
page
of
thin
foreign
paper
stefan
milly
choked
on
the
name
oh
it
awful
his
father
has
consented
to
his
marrying
me
all
right
but
he
go
and
and
be
now
and
i
shall
never
see
him
again
i
the
unluckiest
girl
that
ever
lived
and
just
when
i
thought
everything
was
going
to
be
so
splendid
i
heard
her
wailing
as
i
finished
my
letter
which
was
from
di
the
first
she
had
written
me
it
had
gone
to
brussels
and
been
forwarded
from
there
to
liége
sidney
and
i
are
rushing
back
to
london
as
fast
as
the
car
will
take
us
she
wrote
this
war
news
is
terrible
any
minute
we
may
hear
that
england
mixed
up
in
the
business
there
no
more
fun
motoring
about
the
country
in
this
suspense
and
if
there
war
all
the
house
parties
we
were
asked
to
in
scotland
are
sure
to
be
given
up
we
want
to
be
where
we
can
have
news
every
minute
and
will
hurry
up
the
decorators
so
we
can
get
into
our
house
even
if
things
are
at
sixes
and
sevens
there
from
what
i
hear
everybody
will
be
congregating
in
london
to
be
in
the
heart
of
things
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
all
my
clothes
if
there
war
nobody
will
be
wearing
all
the
nicest
men
will
be
away
at
the
front
is
it
luckily
sidney
wo
have
to
fight
as
america
not
involved
but
i
do
want
to
go
over
there
and
have
people
at
home
calling
me
a
to
sneak
away
from
under
the
zeppelins
and
things
the
germans
will
be
sending
over
i
want
to
do
what
everybody
else
does
though
heaven
alone
knows
yet
what
that
will
be
i
expect
bally
and
kitty
will
come
back
from
harrogate
where
poor
dear
bally
is
celebrating
his
honeymoon
by
taking
a
strict
cure
and
i
hear
kitty
is
doing
mud
baths
to
reduce
her
flesh
they
wire
that
there
is
one
waiter
out
of
sixty
left
in
their
hotel
all
were
so
you
see
what
that
means
and
kitty
maid
had
hysterics
this
morning
because
war
to
be
declared
on
her
country
and
because
the
hotel
chambermaids
are
all
turned
into
waitresses
and
she
had
to
make
bally
and
kitty
beds
one
realizes
that
war
will
be
horrible
for
your
life
wo
be
safe
on
the
continent
you
know
and
you
better
persuade
to
bring
you
back
immediately
though
you
been
so
horrid
to
sidney
he
overlook
it
in
this
crisis
for
my
sake
when
even
ulsterites
and
nationalists
are
forgiving
each
other
father
and
kitty
will
have
to
stay
with
us
when
they
arrive
as
the
norfolk
street
house
is
given
up
and
you
must
of
course
come
too
you
can
be
our
guest
till
you
and
tony
are
married
if
you
do
want
your
engagement
to
last
long
i
hardly
knew
whether
i
most
wanted
to
laugh
or
cry
over
that
letter
all
i
did
know
was
that
nothing
would
induce
me
to
stay
with
diana
and
sidney
vandyke
i
would
even
rather
be
married
if
worst
came
to
worst
but
though
tony
and
i
were
playing
at
being
engaged
the
thought
of
actually
marrying
him
was
like
jumping
over
a
precipice
i
was
ready
for
the
precipice
yet
and
must
avoid
it
if
i
could
i
folded
up
the
letter
and
kept
its
news
and
its
suggestions
to
myself
i
sympathized
with
milly
and
hoped
that
after
all
even
if
russia
and
austria
and
servia
and
germany
flew
in
each
others
faces
it
might
be
possible
for
england
and
france
and
italy
to
keep
the
peace
di
was
always
inclined
to
exaggerate
and
probably
she
was
glad
of
any
excuse
by
this
time
to
put
an
end
to
a
motoring
with
sidney
i
went
to
bed
and
tried
to
believe
that
i
had
had
a
bad
dream
but
next
morning
i
was
still
dreaming
it
the
papers
told
us
how
the
stock
exchange
in
london
had
closed
which
seemed
like
hearing
that
england
had
suddenly
gone
under
the
sea
belgrade
was
being
bombarded
the
germans
as
well
as
russians
were
mobilizing
furiously
king
george
had
telegraphed
to
the
czar
but
before
his
message
had
time
to
reach
petrograd
the
kaiser
had
declared
war
on
russia
belgium
had
begun
mobilizing
too
and
only
just
in
time
trains
were
wanted
for
the
soldiers
frightened
tourists
clamoured
in
vain
to
get
away
even
those
who
had
automobiles
could
hardly
move
along
the
roads
and
many
chauffeurs
were
called
to
their
colours
ours
was
french
and
went
off
at
a
moment
notice
with
just
time
for
a
polite
pour
tony
hated
everything
mechanical
except
rifles
and
revolvers
and
had
never
learned
to
drive
a
car
belgian
chauffeurs
had
something
better
to
do
than
help
travellers
out
of
trouble
so
there
we
were
it
seemed
only
another
phase
of
the
dream
from
which
we
could
not
wake
when
glittering
hordes
of
german
cavalry
the
kaiser
beloved
uhlans
were
said
to
be
clanking
over
the
frontier
to
violate
the
neutrality
of
belgium
and
we
heard
that
great
britain
had
declared
war
on
germany
i
would
have
given
anything
to
be
back
in
england
then
not
because
i
was
afraid
of
what
might
happen
in
belgium
but
because
my
blood
was
hot
with
pride
of
my
country
and
i
wanted
to
be
there
to
see
the
spirit
of
the
people
rise
there
was
little
time
to
think
however
for
liége
was
seething
with
excitement
fugitives
began
to
pour
into
the
town
with
children
and
bundles
in
queer
little
carts
drawn
by
dogs
soldiers
bade
their
families
in
the
streets
and
marched
or
rode
off
in
clouds
of
dust
wounded
men
were
brought
from
the
frontier
and
an
annex
of
our
hotel
was
hastily
turned
into
a
hospital
red
cross
nurses
appeared
from
somewhere
and
several
women
among
the
tourists
volunteered
to
help
dalziel
could
do
nothing
because
she
had
collapsed
with
fear
and
was
sure
that
she
was
in
for
nervous
prostration
milly
had
her
mother
to
care
for
but
i
was
free
and
thanks
to
my
work
in
ballyconal
i
knew
something
about
first
aid
ever
since
i
met
eagle
and
he
had
given
me
the
old
cadet
chevron
which
i
carried
with
me
everywhere
i
had
grown
more
and
more
keen
on
learning
to
do
what
i
could
for
others
and
war
talk
in
texas
had
prompted
me
to
buy
books
on
nursing
i
mentioned
this
as
a
personal
recommendation
the
real
nurses
smiled
but
they
accepted
my
services
as
a
probationer
strong
and
willing
and
glad
to
do
what
she
was
told
even
to
scrub
floors
with
disinfectant
fluid
you
spoil
you
hands
said
milly
i
laughed
almost
at
once
after
this
began
the
bombardment
of
the
forts
at
liége
and
all
day
long
and
most
of
the
night
we
were
deafened
with
the
boom
of
great
guns
across
the
river
it
was
a
relief
to
be
allowed
to
watch
through
the
dark
hours
beside
soldiers
whose
wounds
were
not
serious
enough
to
need
expert
care
that
i
could
not
give
even
if
i
had
been
in
bed
i
should
not
have
slept
i
felt
as
if
my
brain
were
part
of
the
battlefield
where
armies
marched
and
fought
my
heartbeats
were
the
drums
we
grew
used
to
the
firing
of
cannon
it
seemed
a
part
of
everyday
life
it
was
hard
to
remember
after
the
first
that
each
boom
meant
lives
ended
in
violence
perhaps
if
we
had
remembered
we
should
have
gone
mad
suddenly
on
the
third
day
just
at
dawn
came
a
new
sound
a
great
whirring
like
a
thousand
racing
automobiles
and
then
two
loud
explosions
one
after
the
other
different
from
the
roar
of
cannon
or
the
shots
from
the
field
guns
that
night
at
el
paso
the
whole
building
shook
as
if
it
must
fall
and
wounded
men
who
had
slept
restlessly
through
the
thunder
from
the
forts
waked
with
a
wild
start
my
charge
a
belgian
boy
of
nineteen
whose
arms
had
been
amputated
shivered
and
then
relapsed
into
stoical
calm
as
the
house
ceased
to
shake
zeppelin
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice
they
have
dropped
bombs
it
seemed
that
two
must
have
fallen
and
burst
close
by
the
noise
had
been
so
up
from
the
street
below
our
windows
came
a
clamour
of
voices
shrill
and
sharp
which
cut
through
the
constant
whirr
of
the
giant
motor
near
the
head
of
the
bed
was
an
open
window
and
mechanically
rather
than
of
my
own
free
will
i
leaned
far
out
as
some
of
the
professional
nurses
were
leaning
from
other
windows
you
might
get
a
bomb
on
your
head
said
my
soldier
in
his
tired
voice
but
i
did
not
draw
back
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
i
was
not
afraid
it
seemed
just
then
ridiculous
puny
to
care
about
one
self
i
was
rather
than
terrified
realizing
with
a
solemnity
i
had
never
known
that
the
next
minute
might
be
the
last
on
earth
for
all
of
us
in
that
dimly
lit
room
of
narrow
beds
the
sky
was
faintly
gray
with
coming
dawn
i
looked
up
up
into
the
pale
dome
seeking
with
my
eyes
the
great
bird
of
evil
that
had
laid
its
eggs
of
death
there
it
was
immensely
high
above
the
black
shadowy
roofs
and
steeples
of
the
hill
and
plain
a
sinister
shape
like
all
the
german
sausages
in
the
world
rolled
into
one
and
hanging
from
it
cars
full
of
men
reduced
to
the
size
of
beetles
by
that
great
height
the
thing
was
almost
directly
overhead
as
i
looked
up
and
it
seemed
that
if
it
dropped
a
parting
bomb
as
it
sailed
our
poor
little
hospital
must
be
struck
yet
i
continued
to
stare
fascinated
life
and
death
were
twin
brother
and
sister
equally
terrible
and
splendid
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
eagle
just
once
again
i
heard
myself
thinking
as
one
hears
the
ticking
of
a
watch
under
a
pillow
but
i
felt
a
strange
throbbing
eagerness
to
know
quickly
the
great
secret
of
what
comes
next
after
this
world
with
its
seeming
muddle
of
injustice
and
disappointment
its
joys
and
broken
aspirations
why
it
was
like
this
with
me
when
we
had
our
accident
in
the
i
thought
and
even
as
the
remembrance
flitted
ghostlike
through
my
brain
i
saw
tearing
through
the
sky
far
above
the
big
bulk
of
the
zeppelin
a
monoplane
etched
in
black
against
the
light
of
dawn
i
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
really
there
it
must
be
an
image
called
up
by
memory
of
that
moment
some
strange
illusion
of
an
exalted
mind
but
the
image
persisted
like
a
hawk
it
swept
along
the
sky
coming
from
a
direction
opposite
to
that
of
the
zeppelin
as
if
to
swoop
upon
it
from
above
i
thought
i
heard
shots
the
great
dirigible
turned
and
sailed
faster
i
felt
as
if
i
were
all
eyes
and
pounding
heart
could
the
sight
be
real
this
duel
in
the
sky
perhaps
others
watched
it
with
me
i
do
not
know
it
seemed
that
i
was
alone
on
earth
gazing
at
the
incredible
battle
the
zeppelin
made
off
away
from
the
town
toward
the
fortifications
but
the
monoplane
kept
above
it
despite
the
shots
which
spattered
futilely
just
as
the
dirigible
passed
over
the
bridge
which
had
yet
been
blown
up
looking
enormous
for
it
hung
lower
now
the
monoplane
tiny
in
comparison
dived
full
upon
it
with
an
explosion
of
gas
from
the
huge
balloon
the
dirigible
dropped
earthward
its
bird
enemy
seeming
to
fall
with
it
i
gave
a
cry
and
covered
my
eyes
with
both
hands
i
felt
that
i
had
been
broken
crumpled
up
like
a
singed
moth
burnt
by
the
vivid
flame
of
that
awful
sight
but
arms
caught
me
from
behind
as
i
would
have
sunk
to
the
floor
with
the
roar
of
another
explosion
in
my
ears
each
brick
of
the
house
quivering
on
another
a
kind
belgian
voice
was
soothing
me
enfant
and
hands
strong
though
womanly
would
have
pulled
me
away
from
the
window
to
lay
me
down
on
some
unoccupied
bunk
if
i
had
not
struggled
to
keep
my
place
no
no
i
stammered
i
not
going
to
faint
i
must
see
i
must
and
shaking
off
the
nurse
protecting
arms
i
stared
out
toward
an
open
space
away
from
the
town
where
a
vast
mass
of
wreckage
blazed
turning
the
gray
dawn
red
chapter
xviii
héros
rapturously
sobbed
the
belgian
nurse
who
held
me
it
is
he
who
has
saved
the
lives
of
all
our
poor
wounded
ones
and
our
lives
too
did
you
not
see
the
monster
over
our
heads
it
had
to
turn
just
in
the
nick
of
time
an
instant
more
and
there
would
have
been
a
bomb
for
us
thank
heaven
and
thank
the
hero
sent
by
heaven
it
was
a
deed
i
thought
worthy
of
eagle
march
himself
the
air
scout
who
had
accomplished
it
was
his
soul
brother
no
matter
what
country
had
given
him
birth
is
it
certain
do
you
think
that
all
those
men
in
the
zeppelin
died
there
together
i
gasped
every
man
of
them
yes
it
is
certain
but
he
the
man
of
the
monoplane
he
fell
with
them
he
fell
yes
my
child
but
he
fell
free
of
the
zeppelin
he
is
not
in
that
fire
cauldron
there
did
you
see
the
end
of
what
happened
no
i
said
for
a
second
i
covered
my
eyes
oh
it
was
all
in
that
second
we
thought
he
was
lost
sacrificed
for
us
and
even
now
it
is
most
likely
that
he
is
dead
we
saw
the
zeppelin
drop
away
from
under
the
monoplane
then
came
the
flare
of
light
with
the
gas
exploding
and
catching
fire
but
just
before
that
the
monoplane
was
poised
in
the
air
for
an
instant
above
the
great
falling
shape
it
seemed
to
do
you
call
it
down
all
that
happened
was
so
quick
and
sudden
and
the
aeroplane
came
to
earth
so
fast
we
could
not
be
sure
of
her
fate
but
if
she
fell
she
fell
free
of
the
zeppelin
we
shall
soon
hear
the
other
hospitals
in
town
are
full
already
except
our
little
one
which
has
still
room
for
a
few
if
any
are
saved
from
either
of
the
wrecks
they
will
be
brought
here
unless
we
have
filled
up
our
beds
meanwhile
with
people
hurt
by
the
zeppelin
bombs
by
the
mingled
dawnlight
and
firelight
we
could
see
figures
running
to
the
fields
where
the
wreck
of
the
great
dirigible
and
the
heroic
little
monoplane
had
come
down
but
long
before
news
arrived
of
the
fate
we
heard
that
none
of
the
townsfolk
had
been
injured
by
the
explosion
of
the
only
two
bombs
which
the
zeppelin
had
been
given
time
to
drop
three
or
four
buildings
had
suffered
more
or
less
but
fortunately
they
were
shops
and
nobody
had
been
sleeping
there
one
bomb
had
fallen
near
a
hospital
and
tony
dalziel
hearing
a
rumour
that
the
annex
as
ours
was
called
had
been
struck
came
rushing
from
the
hotel
close
by
to
find
out
what
had
been
my
fate
when
he
saw
the
building
untouched
and
with
lighted
windows
he
was
relieved
but
ventured
to
ask
for
me
and
i
ran
down
to
speak
with
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
for
a
moment
peggy
i
just
ca
stand
for
this
he
groaned
and
the
tragedy
in
his
voice
contrasted
so
quaintly
with
his
comic
appearance
bareheaded
hair
ruffled
and
costume
sketchy
that
i
felt
rising
symptoms
of
hysteria
which
had
to
be
controlled
i
must
get
you
and
the
mater
and
milly
into
safety
somehow
is
the
limit
mater
more
dead
than
alive
and
mill
is
much
better
do
worry
about
me
anyhow
i
said
you
see
i
do
much
whether
i
dead
or
alive
that
simplifies
things
a
lot
i
would
go
away
now
if
i
could
you
go
the
first
chance
there
is
insisted
tony
with
new
authority
and
it
may
come
soon
there
are
some
belgian
officers
at
the
hotel
they
came
in
an
automobile
not
so
big
as
ours
and
it
broken
down
if
they
ca
get
it
right
by
when
they
want
to
go
back
to
brussels
where
they
came
from
i
make
a
present
of
our
car
for
the
rest
of
the
war
if
they
take
us
with
them
you
see
it
a
serious
matter
with
me
things
are
getting
worse
here
and
my
leave
soon
be
up
you
do
think
i
go
and
let
you
stay
shut
up
in
liége
with
bombs
falling
all
round
you
and
perhaps
on
you
look
i
said
forgetting
to
answer
as
i
peered
out
through
the
open
street
door
here
come
some
men
with
a
litter
they
bringing
it
this
way
oh
tony
if
it
should
be
the
man
of
the
monoplane
they
think
in
the
hospital
that
he
fell
with
his
machine
clear
of
the
zeppelin
and
may
be
alive
ahead
of
the
slowly
borne
litter
ran
a
youth
with
a
red
cross
band
on
his
arm
seeing
my
nurse
cap
and
apron
all
the
uniform
i
had
he
began
speaking
breathlessly
in
belgian
french
had
we
a
bed
our
nurses
had
sent
word
yesterday
that
if
two
or
three
were
needed
we
could
supply
them
he
hoped
they
had
filled
up
since
as
here
was
an
urgent
case
the
aviator
who
had
attacked
the
zeppelin
and
destroyed
it
by
plunging
on
to
its
balloon
at
the
risk
of
almost
certain
death
but
he
was
not
dead
and
might
live
if
he
could
have
prompt
surgical
attendance
and
nursing
yes
we
can
take
him
in
i
said
everything
is
ready
and
i
run
ahead
of
you
to
warn
the
staff
tell
them
the
red
cross
man
called
after
me
as
forgetful
of
tony
i
turned
to
fly
tell
them
we
think
it
is
the
british
or
american
monsieur
mars
who
did
us
such
service
bringing
news
to
the
forts
from
over
the
german
frontier
two
days
ago
i
dashed
on
without
stopping
to
answer
or
look
back
for
the
litter
was
arriving
and
it
was
not
till
i
repeated
the
name
as
i
gave
in
my
hurried
report
that
the
sound
of
it
on
my
own
lips
made
my
heart
jump
monsieur
mars
could
it
be
the
thought
was
too
i
dared
not
harbour
it
my
ward
was
on
the
top
floor
where
the
least
serious
cases
were
treated
men
who
could
be
got
upstairs
without
too
much
strain
and
suffering
on
the
ground
floor
one
bed
was
free
as
i
knew
and
it
was
into
that
ward
i
went
to
tell
the
news
to
the
matron
perhaps
when
my
duty
was
done
i
did
not
hurry
overmuch
to
return
to
my
own
less
interesting
post
and
i
was
still
in
the
principal
ward
when
the
canvas
litter
borne
by
four
red
cross
men
was
carried
in
doctors
and
nurses
pressed
forward
to
meet
it
and
i
flattened
myself
against
the
wall
sick
with
mingled
fear
and
longing
again
i
thought
the
big
room
which
a
week
ago
had
been
the
restaurant
of
our
prosperous
hotel
annex
was
still
lit
by
electric
lamps
fantastically
unsuited
to
a
hospital
ward
chandeliers
of
sprawling
gilt
branches
decorated
with
metallic
imitations
of
mistletoe
the
light
of
day
outside
was
filtering
in
but
dimly
yet
it
paled
and
made
ghastly
the
yellowish
glow
of
electricity
even
the
doctors
and
nurses
with
their
tired
faces
looked
like
ghosts
and
the
wounded
soldiers
in
their
narrow
white
cots
seemed
figures
of
dead
men
modelled
in
wax
some
of
them
opened
their
eyes
in
deep
violet
hollows
others
kept
the
lids
down
caring
for
or
conscious
of
nothing
the
staff
who
received
the
litter
and
the
red
cross
men
who
brought
it
spoke
in
low
voices
but
never
in
irritating
whispers
the
moving
feet
made
only
a
faint
pattering
sound
on
the
floor
and
the
litter
was
set
down
noiselessly
at
the
side
of
the
one
free
bed
in
the
ward
near
it
stood
a
screen
which
only
a
few
hours
ago
had
hidden
the
death
agony
of
a
soldier
i
looked
at
this
and
shuddered
thinking
once
again
if
it
were
he
and
if
the
screen
should
be
needed
again
for
the
same
purpose
where
i
lurked
out
of
every
one
way
yet
close
to
the
door
flat
as
a
paper
doll
against
the
wall
which
smelled
of
carbolic
acid
nobody
troubled
about
me
i
was
just
one
of
the
younger
nurses
and
none
stopped
to
ask
whether
my
place
were
there
or
upstairs
in
another
ward
oh
god
if
it
be
he
let
him
live
i
heard
my
soul
praying
nurses
leaned
over
the
long
dark
form
on
the
litter
whose
face
i
could
not
see
because
where
i
stood
only
the
top
of
the
head
was
visible
a
head
thickly
covered
with
short
rumpled
hair
which
might
be
blond
or
brown
when
the
blood
stains
were
washed
off
the
bending
figures
quickly
skilfully
cut
away
the
stained
and
blackened
clothing
and
when
it
was
the
surgeon
turn
to
examine
and
perhaps
to
operate
some
one
noticed
the
intruder
the
head
nurse
came
to
me
and
laid
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
my
child
it
was
you
who
brought
us
the
word
just
now
she
said
kindly
her
eyes
on
my
pallid
face
but
you
must
go
to
your
own
duties
this
is
a
great
honour
we
have
to
care
for
the
hero
who
has
saved
us
it
must
be
our
turn
to
save
him
go
tell
the
news
in
the
upper
wards
that
we
hope
for
the
best
the
very
best
say
to
the
doctors
that
it
is
indeed
monsieur
mars
they
will
know
the
name
they
will
have
heard
of
him
and
what
he
did
for
liége
only
the
other
day
i
go
but
instant
first
i
implore
you
nurse
i
pleaded
i
think
it
may
be
that
monsieur
mars
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
i
beg
you
to
let
me
have
a
glimpse
of
his
face
she
looked
at
me
and
hesitated
but
my
imploring
eyes
which
suddenly
spouted
tears
decided
her
kind
heart
in
my
favour
one
glance
then
but
control
yourself
she
said
and
taking
me
round
the
waist
she
led
me
quickly
across
the
room
mademoiselle
our
young
british
assistant
thinks
she
knows
the
patient
the
matron
announced
make
way
for
her
an
instant
then
she
will
go
to
her
own
ward
some
one
pushed
me
forward
at
the
same
time
holding
me
firmly
lest
i
should
collapse
one
fleeting
glance
was
vouchsafed
me
of
a
form
covered
with
a
sheet
and
a
blackened
face
with
eyes
whose
whites
showed
under
the
lids
and
on
whose
lips
was
some
strange
semblance
of
a
happy
smile
to
those
who
did
not
know
him
well
or
love
him
beyond
all
the
world
that
marred
face
might
have
been
unrecognizable
in
its
mask
of
dirt
and
blood
but
nothing
could
disguise
it
from
me
monsieur
mars
the
wounded
hero
of
liége
and
captain
eagle
march
late
of
the
american
army
were
one
and
the
same
i
did
faint
but
i
do
remember
anything
else
till
i
found
myself
sitting
on
a
chair
in
my
own
ward
the
nurses
were
having
morning
coffee
one
of
them
gave
me
a
cup
if
i
had
been
a
nurse
myself
with
patients
to
think
of
i
should
have
dropped
it
and
burst
out
crying
but
instead
i
drank
the
coffee
and
a
moment
later
went
back
to
the
bedside
of
the
man
i
had
been
tending
before
leave
was
granted
me
to
see
tony
you
look
as
if
you
met
the
ghost
of
some
one
you
love
said
the
nurse
who
had
been
keeping
my
place
but
he
was
not
a
ghost
not
yet
not
yet
chapter
xix
tidings
of
the
new
hero
of
liége
floated
up
to
our
ward
within
the
hour
there
was
slight
concussion
of
the
brain
there
were
scalp
wounds
which
had
had
to
be
stitched
up
and
there
were
many
bruises
but
the
surgeons
reported
no
bones
broken
and
complete
recovery
only
a
matter
of
days
even
the
monoplane
itself
we
heard
was
singularly
little
damaged
all
this
would
have
appeared
miraculous
and
the
pious
belgians
would
have
attributed
it
to
direct
intervention
of
the
blessed
virgin
had
not
the
wrecked
dirigible
on
examination
told
a
silent
story
of
the
air
cleverness
as
well
as
his
daring
before
swooping
on
the
zeppelin
from
above
he
had
apparently
discharged
bombs
of
his
own
on
the
balloon
which
had
burst
before
the
monoplane
dashed
down
on
to
it
and
the
great
bulk
had
fallen
away
from
under
without
carrying
the
lighter
machine
to
destruction
the
theory
which
awaited
corroboration
from
the
aviator
was
that
he
had
begun
to
plane
down
despite
some
damage
and
had
actually
fallen
but
a
short
distance
striking
earth
a
hundred
yards
away
from
the
wrecked
dirigible
nobody
talked
about
anything
except
the
feat
of
the
foreign
air
scout
the
roar
of
the
cannon
from
the
fort
had
ceased
to
make
us
jump
and
it
was
better
to
chat
about
monsieur
mars
than
to
murmur
in
each
ears
how
long
before
slip
round
the
forts
and
get
into
the
town
i
made
up
my
mind
that
whatever
happened
nothing
should
tear
me
from
liége
while
eagle
march
was
there
and
when
tony
sent
up
word
begging
to
see
me
on
important
business
in
imagination
i
was
defending
eagle
hospital
cot
naturally
with
him
in
it
against
a
troop
of
uhlans
in
that
mood
tony
arguments
about
my
going
away
made
as
much
impression
as
the
chirp
of
a
sparrow
on
a
man
stone
deaf
in
both
ears
wild
horses
much
less
wild
uhlans
could
drag
me
out
of
this
place
i
said
feeling
as
brave
and
firm
as
a
heroine
though
to
tony
i
may
have
seemed
obstinate
as
a
mule
what
do
you
take
me
for
boy
go
comfortably
away
in
a
motor
car
to
safety
indeed
while
eagle
march
is
here
lying
at
death
door
or
if
he
is
at
door
it
only
because
the
angels
slammed
it
in
his
face
eagle
march
what
are
you
talking
about
tony
wanted
to
know
looking
dazed
i
had
forgotten
that
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
have
guessed
the
hero
identity
and
i
dashed
into
explanations
do
tell
people
yet
i
said
because
he
may
want
it
talked
about
but
the
mars
who
been
helping
belgium
since
the
very
first
day
of
war
why
they
say
gave
the
warning
that
the
germans
would
cross
the
frontier
is
it
him
and
how
silly
of
us
not
to
guess
the
minute
we
heard
the
name
of
it
never
entered
my
head
though
i
heard
it
a
dozen
times
before
this
last
feat
said
tony
people
were
talking
about
other
stunts
mars
had
done
but
i
supposed
he
was
some
french
johnny
are
you
sure
right
sure
it
march
i
mean
it
does
seem
a
little
too
strange
to
be
true
that
he
should
turn
up
or
rather
come
down
here
of
all
places
strange
to
be
true
i
quoted
strange
things
are
the
only
things
that
happen
in
war
for
a
man
like
him
a
man
without
a
country
we
might
have
known
he
would
come
to
the
rescue
of
belgium
and
i
am
sure
i
right
because
i
seen
him
great
scott
was
all
that
tony
had
to
say
for
a
minute
then
he
went
on
in
a
changed
and
heavy
tone
i
suppose
you
nursing
him
no
such
luck
i
answered
i
not
experienced
enough
but
debating
whether
i
might
ask
to
see
him
when
he
gets
better
on
the
strength
of
old
friendship
i
do
think
he
mind
my
claiming
acquaintance
with
mars
mind
i
guess
not
said
tony
but
how
soon
will
he
be
better
he
be
nearly
well
they
hope
in
a
few
days
he
have
to
be
by
george
if
he
wants
to
get
out
of
town
with
his
monoplane
before
the
germans
walk
in
the
belgians
are
the
heroes
of
europe
but
there
are
enough
of
to
hold
out
forever
and
why
you
go
with
us
peggy
march
or
no
march
he
be
the
first
one
to
tell
you
to
clear
out
if
he
had
his
wits
about
him
i
dare
say
he
would
but
he
has
got
them
yet
i
replied
calmly
you
do
really
me
to
leave
him
do
you
tony
after
after
all
i
confessed
to
you
i
expect
you
to
see
reason
tony
lamely
persisted
there
just
one
thing
to
do
and
that
is
to
scoot
while
there
a
chance
if
i
were
alone
without
the
mater
and
milly
i
say
let
hang
on
for
a
day
or
two
longer
and
run
the
risk
though
running
it
might
make
me
overstay
my
leave
that
would
be
nothing
though
i
would
think
of
myself
in
any
way
but
i
ca
let
my
mother
and
sister
go
without
me
to
look
after
them
as
well
as
i
able
i
ca
ask
them
to
stop
and
they
would
if
i
did
for
they
wild
to
get
away
yet
how
can
i
let
you
stay
here
alone
march
would
be
furious
with
you
if
he
came
back
to
himself
and
found
you
hanging
on
i
laughed
he
could
kill
me
the
germans
could
in
spite
of
the
red
cross
and
my
lovely
cap
and
apron
well
i
not
afraid
and
eagle
will
never
know
that
i
stopped
for
his
sake
when
i
might
have
gone
i
not
sure
i
should
have
stayed
in
any
case
i
sure
you
would
if
i
had
to
use
force
but
you
see
what
a
position
you
put
me
in
peggy
how
can
i
a
chap
you
do
care
a
snap
for
at
heart
hope
to
drag
you
away
from
the
one
who
got
it
all
and
yet
what
am
i
to
do
if
you
refuse
to
come
dear
tony
i
said
quietly
i
do
care
lots
of
snaps
for
you
more
than
i
ever
did
i
think
but
oh
i
say
it
is
just
the
poor
little
word
that
appropriate
compared
to
what
i
feel
for
eagle
all
i
have
and
am
is
for
him
though
he
does
want
it
and
will
never
know
i
hope
what
a
fool
his
friend
is
over
him
in
silence
tony
received
the
blow
i
had
to
strike
he
stood
with
his
head
down
for
a
minute
while
i
ached
with
pity
for
him
and
for
myself
though
i
hated
myself
too
because
i
was
hurting
him
you
must
go
with
dalziel
and
milly
i
said
when
he
did
speak
it
the
only
way
i
shall
be
safe
enough
as
safe
as
the
other
nurses
who
knows
and
i
laughed
uneasily
to
break
the
barrier
of
restraint
but
eagle
will
take
me
away
in
his
monoplane
that
would
be
a
splendid
solution
of
the
difficulty
would
it
i
spoke
only
in
jest
but
tony
accepted
the
idea
half
seriously
yes
that
exactly
what
happen
i
expect
he
said
you
go
off
with
him
anyhow
i
lost
you
i
see
that
you
could
never
put
up
with
me
after
this
experience
that
true
is
it
peggy
the
same
thought
put
in
a
less
brutal
way
had
been
heavy
in
my
heart
since
my
glimpse
of
eagle
lying
unconscious
on
the
litter
i
knew
then
that
i
was
married
to
my
love
for
him
and
that
any
other
marriage
would
be
worse
than
illegal
i
hesitated
how
to
answer
but
perhaps
my
silence
spoke
as
clearly
as
words
do
look
as
if
you
just
lost
your
last
friend
my
poor
child
tony
said
in
his
good
warm
way
you
have
lost
me
you
know
though
i
lost
you
and
you
need
look
so
guilty
either
as
if
you
murdered
me
and
buried
me
under
the
leaves
i
was
always
expecting
this
thing
to
come
though
i
did
foresee
the
way
of
it
if
ever
i
felt
tempted
to
believe
our
engagement
was
getting
to
be
the
real
thing
why
i
said
to
myself
till
she
sees
march
again
before
you
begin
to
be
cocksure
my
man
well
now
you
seen
him
and
i
guess
you
seen
in
the
same
minute
that
our
experiment
has
failed
i
afraid
that
true
tony
i
sighed
i
ca
help
it
it
be
fair
to
you
for
us
to
go
on
as
we
are
i
shall
have
to
break
my
word
to
you
if
i
to
be
faithful
to
myself
you
wo
be
breaking
any
old
word
he
said
it
was
never
an
promise
i
teased
you
till
you
agreed
to
try
how
the
thing
would
work
it
been
my
fault
all
through
and
now
i
take
my
medicine
our
engagement
was
never
insured
against
war
risks
and
when
i
get
back
my
senses
i
going
to
be
glad
you
saw
march
before
it
was
too
late
i
brought
you
two
together
sort
of
inadvertently
as
you
might
say
did
i
but
honest
injun
peggy
i
do
the
thing
over
again
knowing
all
i
know
i
only
wish
yes
before
the
lord
i
wish
that
good
may
come
of
it
to
you
both
you
an
angel
tony
a
real
angel
i
almost
sobbed
but
you
think
that
anything
will
of
it
in
the
way
you
mean
because
it
wo
i
do
delude
myself
i
do
even
hope
all
the
same
i
must
be
true
to
my
own
heart
and
i
beg
of
you
to
forgive
me
because
i
know
it
well
enough
before
there
is
any
question
of
forgiveness
said
he
with
his
head
up
and
his
nice
billiken
face
very
pink
i
bless
you
bless
you
for
all
you
been
or
done
to
me
and
i
would
forget
or
undo
anything
if
i
could
you
can
bet
your
life
on
that
i
think
i
could
bear
the
whole
business
like
a
man
if
i
could
stay
right
here
and
see
you
through
but
there
mater
and
milly
to
think
of
and
the
regiment
and
and
oh
well
life
just
one
damn
thing
after
another
dalziel
and
milly
came
and
pleaded
with
me
after
that
and
tried
to
frighten
me
into
going
with
them
but
as
milly
burst
out
desperately
at
last
i
was
as
hard
as
nails
tony
had
told
them
nothing
i
found
about
the
failure
of
our
experiment
or
the
identity
of
monsieur
mars
i
well
understood
why
and
was
grateful
grateful
for
that
and
for
many
things
most
of
all
for
bringing
me
to
belgium
and
neither
grudging
nor
regretting
what
he
had
done
so
as
a
lover
tony
went
out
of
my
life
but
as
a
friend
he
never
can
go
i
had
no
time
to
cry
or
feel
lonely
or
tell
myself
what
a
beast
been
after
the
three
had
reluctantly
left
me
to
my
fate
for
when
i
went
back
on
duty
after
the
it
was
to
find
that
i
had
been
sent
for
to
hasten
to
the
principal
ward
monsieur
mars
was
being
delirious
in
english
and
the
doctors
and
nurses
understood
too
little
of
the
language
to
know
whether
he
were
merely
babbling
or
pouring
forth
important
information
there
eagle
lay
in
his
narrow
white
bed
clean
and
pale
with
his
head
swathed
in
bandages
a
very
different
man
from
the
grimy
bloodstained
vision
that
had
flashed
on
me
a
few
hours
before
the
merest
stranger
who
had
ever
seen
captain
march
would
have
deserved
no
credit
for
recognizing
him
now
the
nurses
waited
eagerly
for
me
to
translate
his
mutterings
but
he
only
mumbled
again
and
again
it
all
over
all
over
if
i
could
guess
at
a
sad
hidden
meaning
for
the
words
it
was
one
which
need
not
be
handed
on
to
others
and
i
proved
so
broken
a
reed
as
a
translator
that
i
expected
to
receive
marching
orders
face
strange
to
say
however
though
his
eyes
were
half
closed
and
he
seemed
to
see
nothing
know
nothing
that
went
on
around
him
after
i
had
spoken
in
a
low
tone
to
his
nurse
eagle
stopped
muttering
for
a
moment
he
appeared
to
listen
and
then
with
a
deep
sigh
as
if
of
relief
from
pain
or
some
heavy
anxiety
the
eyelids
closed
the
slight
frown
which
had
drawn
his
brows
together
slowly
faded
away
he
had
the
air
of
being
at
rest
one
would
almost
fancy
said
the
head
nurse
who
had
been
watching
the
scene
speaking
thoughtfully
when
she
had
beckoned
me
away
from
the
bedside
that
this
brave
monsieur
recognized
your
voice
mademoiselle
then
i
took
heart
of
grace
and
did
what
i
had
told
tony
i
meant
to
do
i
said
that
i
had
met
monsieur
mars
in
england
and
america
i
had
recognized
him
at
once
when
the
red
cross
men
brought
him
into
the
hospital
but
i
had
said
nothing
of
this
at
the
time
because
i
had
felt
that
it
would
be
considered
unimportant
on
the
contrary
mademoiselle
answered
that
adorable
woman
it
is
of
the
importance
this
heroic
monsieur
has
saved
us
from
death
if
there
is
anything
little
or
big
which
we
can
do
for
him
in
return
how
gladly
will
we
do
it
your
voice
has
soothed
him
in
his
unconsciousness
who
knows
what
your
presence
may
do
when
consciousness
comes
back
why
it
would
be
like
throwing
away
an
elixir
to
waste
you
after
this
in
the
ward
above
you
are
from
now
on
promoted
as
assistant
nurse
to
our
hero
she
was
a
stout
plain
person
with
bulgy
eyes
and
a
pink
end
to
her
nose
but
i
saw
her
as
the
most
beautiful
woman
the
world
has
ever
produced
i
took
up
my
new
duties
at
once
trying
not
to
act
as
if
the
moon
were
my
footstool
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
far
into
the
night
eagle
lay
as
if
asleep
with
occasional
fits
of
restlessness
which
somehow
i
could
always
soothe
and
this
state
though
it
seemed
alarming
to
me
was
approved
by
the
doctor
it
was
better
he
said
that
after
concussion
the
brain
should
have
for
a
while
repose
in
unconsciousness
the
symptom
was
not
good
when
the
patient
talked
rationally
too
soon
but
if
monsieur
should
waken
and
show
signs
of
wishing
to
ask
questions
he
must
be
answered
clearly
and
quietly
if
possible
by
the
demoiselle
irlandaise
who
would
best
be
able
to
understand
and
satisfy
him
the
demoiselle
irlandaise
was
advised
by
the
matron
to
take
her
repose
early
in
the
night
in
order
to
be
ready
for
such
an
emergency
as
monsieur
the
doctor
suggested
but
the
demoiselle
felt
no
need
of
repose
sleep
seemed
some
strange
and
foreign
thing
she
sat
through
the
night
watching
the
hero
of
liége
and
though
guns
boomed
and
were
answered
and
the
nurses
occasionally
discussed
beneath
their
breath
what
would
happen
to
us
all
when
the
germans
came
never
in
her
life
had
that
demoiselle
irlandaise
felt
so
happy
and
so
useful
she
had
the
reward
of
her
vigil
toward
dawn
hours
almost
to
the
minute
after
the
zeppelin
and
its
crew
had
been
brought
down
suddenly
eagle
opened
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
the
nurse
at
first
he
stared
as
if
dazed
by
what
he
saw
then
came
a
flash
of
recognition
which
changed
to
incredulity
i
you
he
whispered
huskily
i
bent
over
him
with
an
invalid
cup
of
liquid
food
prepared
for
this
emergency
kept
hot
in
a
vacuum
flask
no
you
not
dreaming
me
i
cheerfully
replied
as
i
made
him
drink
it
peggy
taking
care
of
you
now
go
to
sleep
again
i
still
be
here
when
you
wake
up
next
time
but
he
went
on
staring
round
the
room
where
am
i
the
horse
kicked
me
i
remember
only
that
seems
so
long
ago
i
thought
a
lot
of
things
had
happened
since
then
i
hoped
but
i
suppose
it
all
a
dream
about
about
being
in
belgium
i
prompted
him
seeing
his
sharp
anxiety
not
a
dream
but
true
you
monsieur
mars
the
hero
of
liége
because
you
brought
down
the
zeppelin
and
the
men
who
came
to
drop
bombs
on
us
we
all
grateful
to
you
and
praying
that
you
may
get
well
soon
thank
god
that
it
true
he
sighed
i
wanted
to
do
something
have
been
disappointed
to
wake
up
and
find
i
only
dreamed
after
all
to
find
that
i
was
back
in
london
i
was
afraid
for
a
minute
it
was
the
day
of
but
it
all
right
now
how
is
it
that
you
here
it
seems
oh
i
just
happened
to
be
travelling
in
belgium
with
the
dalziels
when
the
war
broke
out
and
we
got
caught
they
gone
now
but
i
stayed
the
nurses
let
me
help
them
a
little
i
do
the
best
i
can
i
told
them
i
met
you
at
home
but
every
one
here
calls
you
mars
they
know
no
other
name
do
let
them
know
any
other
do
let
any
one
know
i
wo
you
need
worry
now
will
you
sleep
please
or
they
may
think
i
doing
you
more
harm
than
good
you
do
me
the
greatest
good
i
sleep
yes
but
first
tell
me
one
thing
more
about
the
i
planed
down
part
of
the
way
but
the
motor
stopped
working
the
last
i
remember
is
when
i
began
to
fall
the
safe
i
assured
him
hardly
hurt
at
all
and
there
a
belgian
flying
man
in
liége
simon
sorel
who
knows
you
his
mechanic
is
working
on
the
she
be
ready
for
you
when
you
ready
for
her
that
will
be
soon
good
man
sorel
he
said
and
closed
his
eyes
little
peggy
i
heard
him
muttering
later
but
three
minutes
afterward
he
had
dropped
into
a
natural
sleep
magnifique
was
the
belgian
doctor
verdict
in
his
next
round
when
eagle
had
waked
again
and
had
been
attended
by
a
nurse
wiser
and
more
experienced
than
i
there
was
little
that
i
was
allowed
to
do
for
him
but
that
little
was
a
joy
worth
being
born
for
and
i
could
have
died
of
happiness
to
see
how
when
he
was
awake
and
fully
conscious
his
eyes
followed
me
when
i
moved
about
but
it
was
better
to
live
than
to
die
just
then
and
i
did
live
with
all
my
might
i
lived
in
every
nerve
and
vein
for
those
two
days
while
monsieur
mars
was
my
patient
after
the
first
hours
he
insisted
that
he
was
well
enough
to
be
changed
into
the
ward
above
and
leave
his
bed
on
the
ground
floor
to
some
one
more
seriously
injured
on
the
second
day
he
sat
up
in
a
reclining
chair
and
announced
that
twelve
hours
more
would
see
him
out
of
hospital
doctors
and
nurses
protested
that
he
would
throw
himself
back
into
a
fever
and
the
consequences
might
be
serious
but
as
at
that
very
time
the
danger
of
the
town
being
taken
was
imminent
arguments
for
prudence
lost
their
force
toward
evening
on
the
third
day
eagle
with
his
head
and
one
hand
still
in
bandages
was
limping
about
the
field
where
the
had
been
repaired
and
when
he
came
back
it
was
to
say
that
he
thought
he
might
get
off
at
midnight
with
dispatches
for
the
king
in
brussels
he
calmly
announced
this
intention
to
me
as
i
handed
him
an
innocent
cup
of
broth
better
suited
to
a
confirmed
invalid
than
to
a
recovered
aeronaut
but
he
quietly
accepted
the
cup
and
i
saw
by
the
look
in
his
eyes
that
i
was
to
expect
the
first
real
talk
we
had
had
together
what
about
your
going
with
me
peggy
he
asked
as
simply
as
if
he
were
proposing
a
short
pleasure
jaunt
in
a
motor
car
you
know
i
would
suggest
it
if
i
did
think
it
honestly
the
safest
thing
for
you
with
luck
we
can
make
the
trip
in
less
than
an
hour
by
air
heaven
knows
how
long
it
would
take
you
by
earth
and
there
no
one
here
anyhow
to
help
smuggle
you
away
if
i
go
and
leave
you
behind
i
bear
to
do
it
besides
from
brussels
there
a
good
chance
of
your
getting
out
with
refugees
if
you
do
wait
too
long
and
you
can
do
as
much
good
work
in
london
as
in
liége
what
do
you
say
i
wished
that
it
might
take
us
many
hours
to
get
to
brussels
instead
of
less
than
one
but
i
did
put
the
wish
into
words
i
said
only
yes
i
would
go
and
many
thanks
good
that
settled
then
said
he
i
must
tell
our
matron
i
hesitated
i
she
wo
think
me
a
coward
eagle
smiled
almost
as
he
used
to
smile
ages
ago
in
london
when
first
we
were
friends
and
he
still
thought
of
me
as
a
little
girl
few
people
would
call
it
a
cowardly
act
for
a
young
woman
to
fly
out
of
a
beleaguered
town
in
a
battered
aeroplane
with
a
battered
airman
and
i
do
think
your
matron
will
be
one
of
them
she
thank
you
for
what
you
done
here
and
bid
you
but
do
go
yet
to
tell
her
i
have
some
things
to
say
to
you
you
be
my
passenger
and
when
i
start
but
we
have
no
chance
to
talk
and
in
these
times
we
must
face
the
fact
that
we
may
never
have
another
chance
this
side
of
heaven
the
words
went
through
me
like
a
bayonet
for
i
knew
too
well
how
deadly
true
they
were
i
did
try
to
contradict
him
or
talk
about
hoping
for
the
best
for
prattle
of
that
sort
seemed
too
futile
i
only
said
let
take
this
chance
then
i
plenty
of
time
hours
yet
stretch
yourself
out
in
the
and
rest
while
we
talk
i
sit
here
by
you
on
the
window
seat
no
one
was
very
ill
in
this
upper
ward
which
was
kept
for
convalescents
some
of
the
men
had
been
given
cigarettes
to
smoke
some
were
having
their
supper
it
was
generally
known
that
monsieur
mars
and
the
demoiselle
irlandaise
had
been
friends
in
england
and
the
news
having
run
round
the
wards
that
monsieur
mars
had
practically
discharged
himself
as
a
patient
we
were
allowed
to
talk
in
peace
not
an
errand
was
found
for
me
not
a
nurse
looked
or
allowed
us
to
see
that
she
looked
our
way
i
did
mean
to
remind
you
of
my
existence
you
know
peggy
till
i
had
something
to
say
about
myself
worth
saying
eagle
began
speaking
lightly
yet
with
a
nervousness
he
could
quite
hide
i
told
you
that
in
my
last
letter
but
providence
has
things
differently
yes
we
did
expect
to
act
together
in
a
continental
theatre
did
we
i
was
deliberately
flippant
but
i
glad
to
be
in
this
great
play
with
you
even
in
one
scene
and
such
a
little
part
maybe
the
part
seems
little
to
you
it
does
to
me
you
helped
me
to
get
well
twice
as
soon
as
i
should
have
done
among
strangers
heavens
but
i
was
glad
to
see
your
little
face
i
have
told
you
that
first
morning
when
i
waked
up
what
i
going
to
tell
you
now
if
you
had
let
me
then
things
were
rather
mixed
in
my
brain
i
thought
i
was
in
london
and
you
found
me
at
a
sort
of
nursing
home
i
retired
into
for
a
couple
of
days
to
get
patched
up
after
that
er
that
little
accident
i
had
i
suppose
you
heard
something
of
it
at
the
time
though
i
think
you
were
on
the
spot
to
see
tony
told
me
you
were
in
church
and
that
it
was
you
who
stopped
the
horses
when
they
started
to
run
away
i
said
without
beating
round
the
bush
for
i
thought
he
was
bidding
for
my
frankness
on
this
sore
subject
i
hoped
i
might
have
passed
unrecognized
but
i
feared
that
was
too
much
to
expect
i
was
tempted
to
break
my
resolution
and
write
to
you
after
all
explaining
why
i
went
to
lady
diana
wedding
but
i
stuck
it
out
because
well
because
it
a
resolution
silly
maybe
all
the
same
i
had
it
a
good
deal
at
heart
to
find
a
new
place
for
myself
in
the
world
before
i
made
a
sign
to
any
of
my
friends
even
loyal
peggy
besides
i
had
a
safe
sort
of
feeling
you
would
misjudge
me
i
glad
you
felt
that
i
said
almost
glad
enough
to
be
glad
you
did
write
though
i
should
have
liked
to
hear
well
i
thought
of
you
a
lot
if
i
did
write
and
i
could
help
looking
at
you
in
church
that
day
i
sent
you
wireless
messages
with
my
eyes
once
or
twice
although
i
knew
it
would
be
best
if
you
did
get
any
of
them
i
believe
i
did
get
them
i
seemed
to
know
that
some
one
was
calling
me
it
was
a
s
call
eagle
smiled
i
found
well
i
found
that
i
was
in
distress
or
need
of
help
that
precisely
why
i
went
to
george
peggy
i
wanted
to
test
myself
did
you
think
the
reason
might
be
that
no
i
thought
of
a
dozen
things
it
might
be
but
never
that
one
it
was
the
only
motive
that
could
have
taken
me
there
i
felt
it
gave
me
a
right
to
go
even
though
if
people
who
knew
how
things
had
been
saw
me
they
might
well
they
might
think
me
guilty
of
very
bad
taste
but
i
did
mean
to
be
seen
i
was
asked
to
show
a
card
i
walked
in
early
and
chose
a
place
at
the
back
of
the
church
i
trusted
to
the
crowd
to
hide
me
and
it
did
dalziel
may
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
me
between
women
hats
but
he
could
have
been
sure
if
it
had
been
for
that
affair
afterward
that
was
bad
luck
in
a
way
although
i
was
glad
if
the
accident
had
to
happen
that
i
could
be
of
use
however
it
did
affect
the
question
of
my
being
in
church
and
i
must
tell
you
about
that
i
did
go
to
england
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
experiment
with
myself
it
was
another
reason
which
took
me
there
but
being
in
england
i
tried
it
tried
it
with
success
you
mean
me
to
understand
that
you
not
exactly
that
i
not
made
of
iron
or
marble
i
did
sit
there
in
church
without
a
qualm
but
the
feelings
i
had
were
not
those
thought
i
must
defend
myself
against
what
i
felt
was
was
no
more
and
no
less
than
a
rage
of
hatred
against
that
damned
forgive
me
peggy
against
that
damned
villain
sidney
vandyke
i
fiercely
finished
the
sentence
as
he
had
meant
to
end
it
i
ca
pretend
that
that
word
was
the
only
one
to
express
my
feelings
for
him
on
his
wedding
day
eagle
admitted
not
because
taken
diana
from
me
though
that
the
strange
part
i
found
it
out
while
she
was
being
married
to
vandyke
and
it
was
the
thing
i
wanted
to
find
out
in
the
relief
i
ought
to
have
forgiven
him
everything
but
i
did
forgive
the
ruin
he
wrought
on
my
career
overtopped
everything
else
in
my
mind
even
at
that
minute
if
some
great
power
could
have
put
me
in
vandyke
place
at
the
altar
and
given
diana
to
me
instead
of
to
him
i
would
not
have
taken
her
not
even
with
her
love
it
seemed
to
me
that
what
she
would
call
her
love
was
worth
the
name
of
love
after
what
had
passed
it
was
only
the
memory
of
all
i
felt
for
her
which
hurt
just
then
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
but
for
him
god
peggy
to
see
him
at
the
height
of
his
hopes
and
ambitions
made
me
mad
to
choke
his
life
out
it
does
me
good
to
confess
this
to
you
now
for
you
the
only
one
on
earth
to
whom
i
speak
yet
when
you
went
out
of
church
you
saved
him
from
danger
of
death
i
said
thoughtfully
that
just
one
of
life
little
ironies
is
it
eagle
laughed
a
low
and
bitter
laugh
it
occurred
to
me
afterward
that
i
spoilt
a
good
melodramatic
plot
hero
secretly
goes
to
church
to
see
the
woman
who
jilted
him
marry
the
villain
to
whom
he
owes
his
ruin
villain
is
killed
before
his
eyes
on
the
way
to
the
wedding
reception
big
climax
i
think
it
was
more
dramatic
said
i
for
the
hero
to
save
the
villain
life
too
conventional
obvious
sort
of
thing
sneered
eagle
but
i
conventional
and
obvious
i
suppose
i
did
what
i
did
simply
because
i
could
help
it
and
i
probably
do
it
all
over
again
i
have
regretted
it
afterward
perhaps
if
di
if
lady
diana
had
been
in
danger
too
i
bear
her
no
grudge
you
very
noble
i
said
it
not
nobility
it
more
like
callousness
i
freed
myself
from
lady
diana
on
her
wedding
day
or
found
that
i
was
free
but
if
you
could
see
into
my
soul
when
i
think
of
vandyke
you
would
call
me
i
honestly
pray
for
the
day
when
i
can
remember
him
with
indifference
and
when
i
can
say
of
what
he
did
to
me
that
good
is
born
of
evil
what
i
working
for
but
the
time
has
come
yet
maybe
it
will
if
i
can
manage
to
make
myself
of
real
use
in
this
war
i
done
nothing
yet
except
a
little
scouting
liége
thinks
differently
and
so
will
all
the
world
when
it
knows
i
not
working
to
reinstate
myself
in
the
world
eyes
but
in
my
own
and
most
of
all
to
help
belgium
there
are
things
one
does
just
for
the
thing
itself
i
have
a
with
a
country
suffering
unjustly
after
what
i
gone
through
myself
i
seem
to
owe
her
allegiance
as
to
a
friend
who
understands
the
moment
this
war
cloud
began
to
gather
i
thought
it
would
burst
over
belgium
and
i
crossed
the
frontier
from
france
with
the
to
offer
my
services
glad
now
i
failed
in
the
hope
that
brought
me
over
from
america
to
england
i
wanted
to
join
shackleton
polar
expedition
but
he
had
no
need
of
me
so
that
was
why
you
came
to
england
yes
i
told
you
it
was
for
the
sole
purpose
of
testing
my
feelings
at
george
church
being
in
london
i
understand
but
oh
eagle
to
you
would
have
gone
away
for
years
without
bidding
me
you
do
quite
understand
yet
or
you
would
say
that
his
eyes
were
wistful
i
was
disgraced
put
beyond
the
pale
down
and
out
unless
i
could
work
my
way
up
again
out
of
the
mud
mentally
i
was
a
sick
man
now
i
see
clearer
i
on
my
way
to
get
well
in
spite
of
scars
life
or
death
will
cure
me
soon
it
does
much
matter
which
it
mattered
to
me
mattered
so
much
that
i
could
not
speak
a
few
hours
later
i
had
said
to
all
my
friends
at
the
liége
hospital
again
i
was
a
passenger
of
the
flying
through
darkness
as
once
i
had
flown
through
sunshine
hidden
by
the
night
we
winged
our
way
to
brussels
safely
and
surely
and
landed
outside
the
town
after
forty
minutes
in
the
air
forty
minutes
which
seemed
to
me
worth
as
many
years
we
came
down
in
a
farm
field
safely
but
not
silently
and
waked
the
farmer
and
his
three
sons
not
yet
of
soldier
age
they
ran
out
with
rifles
prepared
for
any
emergency
but
a
few
words
of
explanation
warmed
their
hearts
to
welcome
us
i
with
my
little
bundle
my
only
luggage
was
taken
to
the
wife
and
mother
who
exclaimed
over
me
as
if
i
had
dropped
from
another
planet
and
gave
me
a
bed
for
the
rest
of
the
night
one
of
the
boys
offered
to
guard
the
monoplane
while
eagle
went
off
on
the
bicycle
of
the
other
into
town
with
dispatches
from
general
leman
to
the
king
in
the
morning
monsieur
mars
came
back
with
the
news
that
a
party
of
english
ladies
were
starting
for
home
in
the
care
of
a
clergyman
and
that
he
had
asked
if
i
might
go
with
them
they
had
consented
to
take
me
and
i
must
be
ready
in
twenty
minutes
an
automobile
belonging
to
an
officer
would
call
for
me
at
the
farm
it
came
promptly
and
in
it
eagle
and
i
had
our
last
minutes
alone
together
we
talked
cheerfully
but
i
knew
as
well
as
he
knew
that
the
chances
were
ten
to
one
against
our
ever
meeting
again
on
earth
chapter
xx
i
could
not
bear
to
go
away
to
safety
in
england
while
eagle
stayed
behind
daily
risking
his
life
but
he
would
not
listen
to
my
faltering
hints
that
i
should
take
up
red
cross
work
again
in
brussels
if
you
want
to
give
me
peace
of
mind
go
he
said
so
i
argued
no
more
and
smiled
my
best
smile
as
we
clasped
hands
for
the
last
time
that
was
in
the
thronged
railway
station
where
eagle
came
to
see
me
off
and
help
our
pilot
parson
steer
his
charges
through
the
crowd
i
was
glad
then
that
we
had
said
our
real
alone
it
took
us
two
days
to
get
out
of
belgium
at
that
busy
time
of
mobilization
we
changed
trains
so
often
that
we
lost
count
and
frequently
waited
for
hours
at
wayside
places
in
pouring
rain
or
broiling
sun
we
had
much
to
eat
but
most
of
what
we
had
we
gave
to
refugees
worse
off
than
ourselves
or
to
tired
hungry
soldiers
it
was
a
hard
almost
a
terrible
journey
but
it
gave
me
two
friends
and
carried
me
one
stage
farther
on
the
strange
road
along
which
fate
was
leading
me
blindfold
the
two
friends
were
old
maiden
ladies
the
sort
of
old
maiden
ladies
father
and
di
would
have
avoided
like
a
pestilence
if
they
had
met
them
travelling
on
the
continent
they
were
twin
sisters
exactly
alike
in
figure
and
face
their
name
was
splatchley
their
looks
were
as
repellent
as
their
name
and
their
natures
were
angelic
they
were
tall
and
thin
and
sprawling
with
corrugated
iron
foreheads
and
grizzled
hair
which
they
crimped
over
it
in
little
bunches
they
had
wistful
wondering
brown
eyes
like
dogs
eyes
if
you
can
imagine
dogs
wearing
the
sort
of
noses
manufactured
by
the
gross
to
fit
any
face
and
large
teeth
which
made
you
feel
sure
that
no
man
would
ever
have
kissed
the
poor
ladies
at
any
price
their
clothes
and
hats
and
shoes
resembled
french
caricatures
of
british
tourists
and
they
had
a
habit
of
talking
together
in
a
way
to
rasp
the
nerves
but
to
me
they
were
adorable
all
their
lives
they
had
lived
in
a
country
village
fussing
happily
over
church
work
but
an
uncle
who
had
made
jam
and
lots
of
money
died
leaving
everything
to
his
nieces
part
of
that
everything
was
a
large
house
in
fitzjohn
avenue
hampstead
in
which
by
the
uncle
will
the
miss
splatchleys
were
obliged
to
live
for
nine
months
of
the
year
they
had
done
their
duty
by
it
for
the
first
nine
months
and
had
then
with
great
excitement
and
some
trepidation
started
with
a
maid
as
old
as
themselves
for
their
first
trip
abroad
they
had
just
conscientiously
worked
by
the
aid
of
baedeker
from
france
into
belgium
when
the
war
broke
out
and
the
sights
they
saw
among
refugees
inspired
them
with
a
brilliant
and
benevolent
scheme
it
occurred
to
them
that
their
big
house
could
be
turned
into
a
home
for
belgian
refugees
and
they
resolved
to
offer
a
thousand
pounds
toward
the
expense
of
bringing
penniless
people
over
to
england
they
could
have
their
largest
bedrooms
altered
into
beehives
of
cubicles
for
single
women
and
stick
little
families
of
mothers
and
children
into
the
smaller
rooms
parkins
will
help
they
said
as
we
whiled
away
dreary
hours
of
waiting
in
discussing
over
and
over
again
their
plans
and
so
saying
they
smiled
affectionate
smiles
at
the
old
woman
who
had
been
in
their
service
since
they
were
all
three
young
together
but
we
must
have
at
least
a
couple
of
nurses
to
help
the
poor
distracted
mothers
with
the
children
and
of
course
there
must
be
a
second
cook
and
another
housemaid
to
make
things
comfortable
they
went
on
we
must
try
and
think
of
some
nice
young
girl
too
among
our
friends
who
would
give
up
her
time
to
work
with
us
we
too
old
to
make
a
success
alone
then
they
ran
over
a
list
of
the
girls
they
knew
in
town
and
country
but
were
able
to
suggest
no
one
whom
they
both
jane
and
emma
could
agree
upon
as
suitable
while
these
two
angels
were
busily
racking
their
brains
i
sat
with
a
great
idea
developing
in
mine
i
suppose
i
must
have
looked
intelligent
and
eager
while
this
was
happening
for
miss
jane
was
moved
to
inquire
if
by
chance
i
knew
of
anybody
who
would
do
a
girl
who
is
kind
and
willing
and
bright
and
strong
and
rich
enough
to
give
up
all
her
time
for
nothing
explained
the
dear
old
lady
a
very
difficult
combination
i
know
and
anyhow
your
friends
care
to
bother
perhaps
with
such
a
institution
as
ours
will
be
there
be
hundreds
of
charities
organized
by
princesses
and
duchesses
smart
affairs
that
will
do
good
on
a
grander
scale
than
we
can
and
maybe
get
a
little
fun
out
of
it
too
but
you
look
as
if
you
had
something
on
your
mind
to
help
us
out
with
so
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
asked
i
know
a
girl
who
would
like
to
help
you
i
said
if
you
have
her
she
willing
and
strong
though
not
at
all
kind
and
perhaps
not
so
very
bright
she
is
rich
either
but
poor
as
the
churchiest
mouse
still
she
gladly
give
up
all
her
time
if
she
may
stay
with
you
because
she
has
no
home
that
she
can
properly
call
a
home
we
should
her
to
stay
with
us
of
course
they
protested
both
together
as
usual
but
if
she
is
kind
perhaps
she
could
learn
to
be
kind
she
would
try
hard
i
said
meekly
her
name
is
peggy
they
thought
i
was
joking
at
first
and
when
i
made
them
understand
that
i
was
in
dead
earnest
they
shook
their
heads
and
looked
dubious
fearing
it
would
work
you
see
my
dear
miss
emma
explained
volubly
assisted
by
miss
jane
you
are
the
only
earl
daughter
or
indeed
member
of
the
aristocracy
higher
than
a
knight
family
we
have
ever
met
socially
if
you
can
speak
of
this
as
being
actually
in
all
senses
of
the
word
whenever
they
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
couple
our
train
nicely
or
when
we
fall
out
in
a
heap
at
some
wayside
place
like
this
we
do
flatter
ourselves
that
you
be
likely
to
select
us
for
acquaintances
if
you
were
able
to
at
this
time
and
you
might
be
pleased
with
our
ways
at
home
we
have
kippers
for
breakfast
sometimes
and
always
cold
supper
sunday
nights
i
assured
them
passionately
that
if
providence
had
made
them
both
expressly
for
my
taste
we
could
be
better
suited
to
each
other
as
for
being
an
earl
daughter
said
i
there
was
nothing
in
that
except
extra
charges
from
dressmakers
and
hotels
and
having
things
you
had
never
done
attributed
to
you
in
paragraphs
of
penny
weeklies
then
i
drew
on
all
my
funds
of
pathos
describing
myself
as
unwanted
and
unloved
this
did
the
trick
the
twin
angels
took
me
to
their
hearts
and
promised
me
a
place
in
their
home
and
scheme
by
the
time
we
got
on
board
the
boat
they
had
dropped
my
handle
and
were
calling
me
peggy
dear
in
london
a
crowd
had
come
to
the
station
expressly
to
welcome
and
cheer
us
returning
wanderers
and
london
was
not
the
same
london
we
had
left
a
few
weeks
ago
it
was
a
city
under
a
spell
a
london
of
some
strange
dream
all
the
stranger
because
the
only
change
was
in
the
people
later
it
changed
again
becoming
almost
gay
and
lively
in
outer
appearance
but
at
this
time
the
balance
was
not
adjusted
soldiers
and
recruits
were
marching
through
the
streets
which
but
for
them
and
those
who
dazedly
watched
them
were
almost
empty
instead
of
the
mad
herds
of
motor
omnibuses
which
had
gone
charging
up
and
down
in
old
days
a
few
moved
sedately
with
here
an
ancient
horse
bus
unearthed
from
oblivion
of
the
lively
streams
of
taxis
blue
and
green
and
black
and
gray
the
source
seemed
suddenly
more
than
half
to
have
dried
up
some
melancholy
and
hansoms
had
made
bold
to
steal
out
and
were
finding
customers
little
boys
were
playing
soldiers
in
the
middle
of
pall
mall
no
longer
a
maelstrom
there
was
no
din
of
traffic
to
drown
the
music
of
their
sixpenny
drums
and
penny
trumpets
looking
into
the
doorways
of
the
biggest
shops
one
saw
nobody
but
the
attendants
waiting
to
serve
customers
who
were
not
there
and
would
not
come
outside
the
little
shops
the
proprietors
were
frankly
standing
to
wonder
sadly
what
had
happened
to
them
and
to
london
and
what
worse
thing
was
likely
to
happen
next
they
talked
in
low
voices
to
each
other
trying
to
smile
or
read
the
latest
war
edition
of
some
newspaper
most
of
the
people
who
were
in
the
streets
seemed
to
have
come
there
to
look
at
the
soldiers
or
to
read
the
papers
which
they
did
regardless
of
bumping
into
all
the
others
who
were
doing
the
same
thing
nobody
appeared
to
think
of
buying
anything
though
the
shopkeepers
had
already
pathetically
changed
the
aspect
of
their
windows
to
suit
altered
circumstances
instead
of
displaying
lovely
dresses
they
showed
rolls
of
khaki
cloth
or
linen
cotton
or
flannel
for
shirts
and
gray
army
blankets
shoemakers
had
bundled
away
their
attractive
slippers
and
put
forward
conspicuously
brown
boots
to
which
they
drew
the
attention
of
officers
and
soldiers
chemists
had
hung
printed
cards
advising
the
public
to
keep
up
their
strength
in
war
time
by
taking
so
and
so
tonic
wine
but
no
one
cared
no
one
bought
there
was
a
dazed
look
on
most
of
the
faces
if
those
who
read
newspapers
cannoned
into
each
other
instead
of
glaring
or
swearing
they
smiled
mildly
wistfully
and
perhaps
fell
into
conversation
about
the
war
one
felt
able
to
guess
what
all
the
millions
in
london
and
even
in
all
england
and
europe
were
talking
about
and
thinking
about
at
any
given
moment
yet
it
was
strange
to
us
who
had
come
from
the
hot
red
heart
of
the
war
to
see
no
other
sign
of
it
except
this
dreamlike
silence
which
hid
the
pain
of
parting
from
those
loved
best
nobody
came
to
meet
me
at
the
station
because
not
knowing
when
i
should
succeed
in
arriving
i
had
not
tried
to
wire
nor
would
a
message
have
been
likely
to
reach
its
destination
if
i
had
the
miss
splatchleys
took
me
home
with
them
as
if
i
had
been
an
adopted
child
and
it
was
from
the
appropriate
address
of
the
haven
that
i
telegraphed
father
and
diana
reached
london
safely
with
friends
who
have
asked
me
to
visit
them
writing
explanations
miss
jane
and
miss
emma
prophesied
that
his
lordship
would
put
down
his
foot
on
our
plans
but
they
did
not
know
him
i
did
having
received
my
promised
explanations
he
was
more
genial
on
paper
than
he
often
took
the
trouble
to
be
for
only
peggy
he
wrote
from
di
new
house
in
park
lane
a
letter
eminently
fitted
to
be
read
aloud
and
to
impress
with
his
graciousness
the
middle
classes
personified
by
estimable
if
vulgar
females
labelled
splatchley
he
had
it
seemed
made
inquiries
about
these
ladies
and
was
in
receipt
of
quite
satisfactory
references
i
had
his
permission
to
visit
them
until
further
notice
and
help
in
their
good
work
which
he
thoroughly
approved
in
these
early
trying
days
when
everybody
was
organizing
something
also
he
was
prepared
to
make
me
a
small
weekly
allowance
for
personal
expenses
and
charities
he
enclosed
a
cheque
for
the
first
week
it
was
for
two
guineas
kitty
added
a
postscript
with
a
good
many
italics
she
was
glad
that
i
was
safe
after
that
terrible
time
when
she
and
dear
ballyconal
had
been
worried
about
me
and
would
have
been
even
anxious
if
they
had
had
any
time
to
think
of
themselves
of
course
in
the
circumstances
she
could
understand
that
it
would
be
awkward
for
me
to
accept
major
vandyke
hospitality
so
perhaps
things
were
best
as
they
were
especially
as
i
would
be
working
for
the
good
cause
but
i
come
and
see
them
surely
i
could
do
that
and
it
would
make
talk
if
i
did
not
she
was
sure
i
would
be
interested
in
the
sewing
guild
which
di
had
started
everybody
was
starting
a
guild
of
some
sort
but
this
was
a
very
special
one
consisting
of
the
most
not
a
woman
on
the
list
of
workers
whose
name
you
could
find
in
burke
and
debrett
diana
also
wrote
not
at
all
hurt
that
i
had
accepted
her
invitation
indeed
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
episode
quite
taking
it
for
granted
that
i
was
disposed
of
with
the
miss
splatchleys
for
some
time
to
come
kitty
and
i
will
motor
out
to
see
you
the
first
day
we
have
a
chance
she
said
if
we
can
fitzjohn
avenue
i
never
heard
of
it
but
then
one
does
hear
of
streets
in
hampstead
i
suppose
except
in
war
or
crises
like
that
when
we
all
as
democratic
as
saints
you
might
ask
your
friends
for
a
subscription
to
buy
shirt
material
for
us
to
make
up
i
can
get
more
workers
than
i
need
but
very
little
money
and
we
need
a
lot
especially
as
some
of
us
have
had
no
experience
in
sewing
and
we
do
waste
rather
a
lot
of
material
getting
things
wrong
at
first
still
we
are
persevering
and
you
must
come
and
see
us
at
work
cutting
out
and
putting
together
garments
for
the
wounded
every
afternoon
in
my
where
the
decorations
are
all
finished
and
immensely
admired
we
have
tea
and
i
engaged
a
palmist
who
tells
us
what
will
happen
to
our
friends
at
the
front
and
how
the
war
will
end
she
encourages
us
and
keeps
us
up
later
we
hope
to
get
convalescent
officers
to
tell
us
their
experiences
while
we
sew
could
you
do
any
knitting
for
us
i
remember
you
learnt
from
your
nurse
when
you
were
a
small
child
i
thought
it
so
irritating
of
you
but
it
might
come
in
useful
now
if
you
remember
the
stitch
some
of
us
can
crochet
but
it
seems
that
wo
do
for
socks
a
good
many
use
worsted
of
a
pretty
colour
which
does
clash
with
their
frocks
but
as
for
me
thrown
aside
vanity
do
forget
to
ask
the
miss
splatchleys
for
a
cheque
as
bally
says
they
rich
and
i
do
hope
you
have
jilted
poor
tony
he
has
gone
as
of
course
you
have
heard
and
the
dalziels
do
know
i
mean
about
you
and
t
i
see
them
every
day
milly
spoiled
two
shirts
this
afternoon
but
her
mother
bought
us
some
beautiful
readymade
ones
instead
with
tucked
fronts
work
was
so
real
and
so
pressing
with
us
at
the
haven
that
i
laughed
at
the
picture
of
diana
guild
with
its
list
of
helpers
from
debrett
its
palmist
and
its
tea
miss
jane
and
miss
emma
however
said
that
it
was
my
duty
to
go
and
see
my
family
as
i
was
younger
than
they
were
and
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
they
could
get
to
me
the
desired
cheque
i
had
meant
to
mention
but
in
reading
the
funny
part
of
the
letter
aloud
one
of
di
references
to
it
fell
out
inadvertently
and
the
generous
creatures
caught
it
up
they
were
prepared
to
spend
many
hundreds
of
pounds
in
turning
the
haven
into
a
refuge
and
in
supporting
the
homeless
belgian
women
and
children
to
whom
they
offered
hospitality
but
they
could
allow
my
sister
to
ask
in
vain
i
was
given
twenty
guineas
for
the
guild
and
told
that
i
ought
to
take
the
cheque
myself
for
i
would
discover
that
it
was
the
busiest
people
who
could
always
find
time
we
were
busy
from
in
the
morning
till
at
night
with
indigestibly
short
intervals
snatched
for
meals
but
as
the
two
angels
said
there
was
always
time
to
do
one
more
thing
on
that
principle
i
contrived
to
go
to
diana
on
one
of
her
afternoons
armed
with
the
splatchley
cheque
and
my
own
knitting
strongly
resolved
not
to
drink
any
of
sidney
vandyke
tea
or
eat
one
of
his
horrid
éclairs
i
was
ushered
into
the
house
by
two
powdered
footmen
far
too
big
for
it
it
is
a
small
house
for
park
lane
all
up
and
down
stairs
but
the
is
of
good
size
and
when
a
butler
published
my
name
at
the
door
i
saw
that
the
room
was
full
of
women
young
old
and
seated
at
or
standing
at
long
tables
cutting
out
shapes
from
hideous
materials
there
were
some
quaint
sights
to
be
seen
at
the
haven
rooms
being
partitioned
off
into
cubicles
others
being
turned
into
dormitories
nurseries
or
refectories
for
the
refugees
who
had
already
begun
to
arrive
before
things
were
half
ready
to
receive
them
but
diana
smart
new
in
park
lane
presented
a
far
more
extraordinary
study
in
contrasts
than
anything
the
haven
could
show
improbable
furniture
was
pushed
back
against
white
and
gold
and
walls
tables
and
chairs
were
piled
with
rolls
of
bleached
and
unbleached
cotton
feverishly
pink
flannelette
and
scarlet
flannel
or
littered
with
parts
of
garments
some
of
which
judging
from
the
confusion
and
clamour
about
them
had
got
badly
mixed
on
the
curtains
of
primrose
yellow
silk
were
pinned
placards
announcing
patriotic
meetings
of
women
who
wished
to
assist
or
form
recruiting
agencies
or
appeals
from
the
red
cross
society
or
the
prince
of
wales
fund
rugs
had
been
rolled
up
and
the
polished
parquet
floor
was
strewn
with
shirt
buttons
reels
of
cotton
and
torn
papers
of
pins
scissors
hid
among
scraps
of
waste
material
and
on
request
were
searched
for
by
very
young
girls
whose
apparent
business
was
to
supply
the
with
and
garments
to
fold
and
stack
the
finished
things
according
to
kind
and
to
knit
wildly
at
intervals
on
immense
stockings
with
singularly
long
feet
which
clearly
could
suit
no
one
but
santa
claus
as
according
to
my
stepmother
all
the
ladies
of
the
guild
were
swells
i
expected
to
find
the
fair
brigade
of
volunteers
exquisitely
dressed
in
the
latest
paris
fashions
of
before
the
war
but
no
they
had
invented
a
still
later
fashion
of
their
own
it
was
to
be
frumpish
the
smart
thing
for
the
women
of
great
britain
was
to
have
their
hair
done
plainly
with
an
angelic
effect
of
putting
patriotism
before
vanity
and
having
no
time
to
spend
on
self
no
money
either
to
judge
from
their
frocks
where
they
had
raked
up
their
old
clothes
i
ca
imagine
there
were
skirts
and
blouses
in
that
transformed
in
which
a
few
weeks
ago
their
wearers
would
not
have
gone
out
to
burn
down
a
church
or
to
be
dragged
to
prison
still
i
must
say
that
most
of
the
wearers
contrived
to
look
very
distinguished
even
those
at
the
who
had
got
tousled
as
children
do
over
unaccustomed
schoolroom
tasks
no
one
had
on
any
jewellery
except
kitty
dalziel
and
milly
and
one
or
two
others
who
were
also
evidently
americans
not
required
to
sacrifice
everything
for
great
britain
sake
they
with
their
pretty
dresses
their
rings
and
earrings
and
strings
of
large
glistening
pearls
were
like
gay
flowers
in
a
kitchen
garden
kitty
fat
and
fashionable
and
di
slim
and
elaborately
frumpish
came
to
meet
me
with
pajama
legs
in
their
hands
they
did
trouble
to
take
off
their
thimbles
and
i
thought
they
seemed
far
from
being
ashamed
of
the
needle
pricks
on
their
fingers
a
few
of
the
girls
i
knew
already
and
some
of
the
older
women
all
had
heard
from
di
or
from
the
dalziels
that
i
had
been
doing
a
little
amateur
work
as
a
nurse
in
belgium
but
no
one
not
even
di
herself
expressed
curiosity
as
to
details
they
had
so
much
to
think
of
that
interested
them
more
and
i
was
thankful
for
the
of
kitty
and
di
which
saved
me
from
awkward
questions
as
to
how
i
had
contrived
to
get
out
of
liége
it
was
simply
taken
for
granted
by
my
family
that
according
to
my
own
written
account
i
had
made
the
journey
home
with
thoroughly
reputable
refugees
i
felt
sure
that
tony
had
not
given
his
mother
and
sister
any
indiscreet
information
about
monsieur
mars
neither
did
he
appear
to
have
told
them
that
our
engagement
was
definitely
broken
off
their
unsuspecting
friendliness
made
me
feel
guilty
and
i
decided
that
i
ought
sooner
or
later
to
let
them
know
the
truth
that
day
at
di
however
they
gave
me
no
chance
to
speak
even
if
had
strength
of
mind
to
snatch
it
tony
was
safely
on
his
way
to
america
travelling
in
the
steerage
having
given
up
his
cabin
to
as
many
ladies
as
it
could
hold
he
was
admiringly
mentioned
and
then
dismissed
as
a
subject
of
conversation
in
favour
of
others
more
exciting
to
his
family
and
closer
at
hand
milly
while
sewing
spasmodically
on
a
weirdly
shaped
shirt
which
could
only
be
got
on
or
off
by
a
weirdly
shaped
man
talked
about
stefan
and
produced
a
letter
from
him
which
she
cherished
inside
her
blouse
he
had
been
wounded
seriously
though
not
dangerously
in
poland
and
invalided
home
it
was
not
thought
that
he
would
be
able
to
do
any
more
fighting
and
so
when
he
was
strong
enough
he
hoped
to
try
and
reach
england
in
order
that
they
might
be
married
at
once
if
milly
would
not
mind
taking
an
invalid
for
a
husband
apparently
milly
did
not
mind
in
what
condition
she
took
her
count
provided
she
was
sure
of
getting
him
she
was
looking
forward
if
all
went
well
to
becoming
a
russian
countess
within
a
few
weeks
for
stefan
expected
to
arrive
in
a
ship
from
archangel
along
a
sea
route
protected
by
the
british
navy
she
had
so
little
fear
of
anything
going
wrong
that
she
was
encouraging
dressmakers
by
starting
her
trousseau
and
had
begun
to
study
the
russian
language
as
a
surprise
for
her
fiancé
dalziel
talked
about
stefan
too
and
how
she
would
help
nurse
him
back
to
health
in
a
suite
at
the
savoy
when
he
and
milly
were
married
meanwhile
mother
and
daughter
were
giving
themselves
up
to
good
works
it
seemed
whenever
they
had
a
minute
to
spare
from
their
own
affairs
milly
went
three
times
a
week
to
the
russian
embassy
to
sew
for
the
russians
and
came
twice
a
week
to
diana
guild
dalziel
had
joined
two
committees
got
up
by
stranded
americans
at
the
savoy
one
to
supply
money
for
moneyless
millionaires
and
the
other
to
find
clothes
for
clotheless
millionairesses
whenever
one
of
diana
workers
collapsed
with
fatigue
she
was
given
tea
or
something
to
eat
and
allowed
an
interval
repose
in
boudoir
which
had
become
the
temporary
of
madame
mesmerre
the
tame
clairvoyant
was
expressly
forbidden
to
foretell
anything
depressing
if
she
could
not
get
visions
of
husbands
sons
and
lovers
coming
safely
home
it
was
distinctly
understood
with
diana
who
paid
by
the
afternoon
that
she
must
have
any
visions
at
all
this
arrangement
however
was
a
family
secret
which
kitty
betrayed
to
me
in
confidence
every
one
said
that
madame
mesmerre
was
wonderful
but
i
did
consult
her
i
do
understand
much
about
sewing
or
other
really
useful
things
of
that
sort
but
i
picked
up
enough
thanks
to
helping
my
poor
friends
at
ballyconal
to
know
that
men
shirts
ought
to
have
armholes
bigger
than
those
for
little
boys
and
that
they
should
be
as
short
as
bibs
or
as
long
as
surplices
even
this
small
amount
of
knowledge
made
me
unexpectedly
useful
at
the
guild
where
every
member
seemed
to
have
her
own
original
conception
of
what
shape
a
shirt
ought
to
be
and
what
it
should
be
made
of
even
my
brief
apprenticeship
with
the
miss
splatchleys
to
whom
most
kinds
of
domestic
work
was
as
easy
as
breathing
made
these
fashionable
women
desperate
efforts
at
doing
good
seem
pathetic
i
agreed
to
return
whenever
i
could
but
no
one
would
promise
to
come
and
see
the
haven
home
for
belgian
refugees
they
were
all
too
busy
working
by
day
and
at
night
it
was
a
to
go
to
a
theatre
or
music
hall
because
the
performance
was
given
for
the
benefit
of
some
fund
or
else
somebody
sang
a
patriotic
song
to
encourage
recruiting
we
grew
busier
and
busier
at
the
haven
as
the
days
went
by
refugees
poured
in
there
was
hardly
time
to
be
sad
or
anxious
in
the
daytime
but
at
night
always
always
my
brain
ceased
to
feel
like
a
brain
and
became
a
battlefield
as
before
in
belgium
the
horror
and
anguish
of
war
poured
into
my
soul
as
water
pours
into
a
leaking
ship
the
most
dreadful
thoughts
could
be
warded
off
in
the
busy
hours
of
the
day
but
in
the
night
stillness
they
found
me
without
defence
and
i
surrendered
those
were
the
hours
when
it
seemed
to
me
impossible
that
any
of
the
men
i
knew
and
above
all
eagle
march
could
ever
escape
from
the
slaughter
alive
the
miss
splatchleys
said
that
i
looked
pale
and
thin
with
blue
shadows
under
my
eyes
and
begged
me
not
to
work
so
hard
but
i
could
have
worked
twice
as
hard
without
realizing
that
i
was
tired
if
some
one
who
knew
the
future
as
no
can
know
it
had
told
me
that
eagle
would
come
out
of
the
war
unharmed
even
when
there
was
scarcely
time
for
a
decent
meal
there
was
time
to
read
the
war
news
all
night
long
i
existed
for
the
moment
in
the
morning
when
the
two
papers
which
the
miss
splatchleys
took
in
should
arrive
and
i
could
bolt
the
big
headlines
and
secretly
search
for
the
name
of
monsieur
mars
then
whether
i
found
it
or
not
the
same
suspense
had
to
be
lived
through
till
the
afternoon
when
the
evening
editions
came
out
and
after
that
again
until
the
hour
for
the
last
war
extra
often
the
name
of
mars
started
up
to
my
eyes
from
the
closely
printed
columns
and
set
my
heart
beating
and
my
blood
flying
to
my
head
no
one
seemed
to
have
identified
him
as
captain
march
not
even
the
british
or
american
war
correspondents
who
occasionally
reported
his
exploits
or
if
they
did
they
respected
his
wish
to
keep
it
secret
mars
the
belgian
air
scout
he
was
generally
called
for
few
journalists
appeared
to
know
that
he
was
a
foreigner
who
had
offered
his
services
to
the
brave
little
country
wonderful
almost
miraculous
feats
were
attributed
to
him
sometimes
they
were
denied
but
usually
they
proved
to
be
true
one
morning
i
read
that
he
had
made
a
daring
flight
of
two
hundred
miles
over
german
territory
had
dropped
bombs
on
an
ammunition
train
had
been
fired
on
and
returned
to
his
base
somewhere
in
flanders
with
the
wings
of
his
machine
riddled
by
bullets
again
he
and
sorel
who
had
been
at
liége
when
we
were
there
went
reconnoitring
over
the
great
german
fortress
of
metz
hoping
to
destroy
the
zeppelin
sheds
quickly
they
were
detected
although
nearly
three
thousand
feet
above
the
forts
up
came
shots
from
guns
spattering
around
them
like
spray
from
a
fountain
but
they
persevered
making
for
the
direction
of
the
drill
ground
then
suddenly
mars
motor
ceased
to
work
it
seemed
that
all
was
over
for
him
and
the
task
left
for
sorel
to
finish
alone
but
mars
said
the
papers
resolved
not
to
give
his
life
away
for
nothing
sweeping
down
in
a
bold
volplane
he
launched
his
bomb
and
had
abandoned
himself
for
lost
when
suddenly
the
motor
started
again
whereupon
he
darted
off
defiantly
following
simon
sorel
who
had
thrown
his
bomb
also
and
escaped
if
this
had
been
all
i
might
have
borne
it
somehow
in
my
pride
of
eagle
but
there
was
always
something
more
i
read
of
his
monoplane
being
struck
by
a
fragment
of
bursting
shell
over
the
enemy
lines
and
his
volplaning
with
a
disabled
engine
to
drop
into
safety
and
a
french
stone
quarry
with
important
information
to
give
concerning
the
disposition
of
german
forces
when
paris
was
threatened
and
almost
despairing
mars
flew
over
the
sad
city
letting
fall
leaflets
with
the
inspiring
message
prenez
courage
tout
va
bien
over
brussels
also
he
maneuvered
dropping
his
leaflets
and
while
angry
german
soldiers
took
aim
at
him
and
his
monoplane
he
looped
the
loop
far
above
their
noses
his
cool
remark
after
this
exploit
was
said
to
have
been
these
germans
do
shoot
badly
he
had
more
than
one
duel
in
the
air
with
hostile
war
planes
having
vowed
with
the
belgian
airmen
to
ram
all
enemy
aircraft
whenever
possible
there
was
a
fearsome
account
to
read
one
morning
of
his
bringing
down
an
aeroplane
which
had
dropped
bombs
on
the
heads
of
french
troops
helping
out
the
wounded
aviator
and
military
observer
and
then
setting
fire
to
their
machine
in
this
adventure
the
was
injured
and
another
monoplane
was
lent
the
airman
while
his
own
was
being
put
to
rights
the
elusive
mars
newspapers
began
to
name
him
because
in
the
face
of
almost
certain
destruction
he
invariably
escaped
in
the
nick
of
time
and
within
an
inch
of
his
life
at
last
however
one
october
day
of
good
news
for
the
allies
there
was
bad
news
for
me
they
had
put
it
in
big
headlines
on
the
most
important
page
mars
the
belgian
airman
caught
at
last
while
reconnoitring
his
machine
is
disabled
and
falls
in
enemy
lines
he
is
believed
to
be
wounded
and
is
certainly
a
prisoner
i
had
no
heart
to
rejoice
in
the
tidings
which
made
the
rest
of
my
world
happy
that
day
and
for
many
days
afterward
days
each
one
of
which
seemed
a
lifetime
of
suspense
there
was
no
other
news
of
eagle
march
i
felt
as
if
the
future
were
a
very
long
dim
corridor
in
whose
chill
twilight
i
groped
my
eyes
straining
toward
the
distance
so
a
month
dragged
itself
away
and
then
came
news
at
last
chapter
xxi
escape
of
the
gallant
mars
were
the
words
that
seized
my
eyes
as
i
opened
the
front
door
of
the
haven
to
snatch
the
morning
papers
rain
was
pouring
down
but
i
halted
in
the
porch
to
read
oblivious
of
the
rivulet
that
streamed
over
my
hair
mars
the
elusive
had
been
true
to
his
name
once
more
it
was
an
almost
miraculous
story
or
would
have
seemed
so
in
less
stirring
times
than
these
which
are
teaching
us
that
brave
men
can
do
anything
they
set
their
minds
to
do
mars
with
a
few
english
prisoners
and
some
russians
from
general
rennenkampf
force
captured
in
east
prussia
had
been
sent
to
work
in
the
fields
outside
a
little
german
town
in
alsace
several
of
these
among
them
mars
had
been
wounded
and
in
hospital
together
but
were
turned
out
as
cured
the
moment
they
were
strong
enough
to
wield
a
scythe
led
by
mars
a
young
russian
officer
and
a
private
in
a
highland
regiment
had
escaped
from
the
gang
of
prisoners
by
crawling
for
a
long
distance
through
tall
ranks
of
grain
they
had
hidden
themselves
among
the
stacks
and
at
night
had
continued
their
progress
in
the
direction
they
hoped
of
the
french
frontier
next
morning
they
were
given
shelter
by
a
farmer
wife
whose
sympathies
were
with
france
she
provided
them
with
disguises
but
they
ventured
to
move
only
at
night
at
the
end
of
four
nights
travel
they
came
upon
french
soldiers
advancing
into
alsace
and
made
themselves
known
but
not
until
they
had
been
fired
on
as
spies
mars
and
the
russian
had
both
been
wounded
and
were
in
a
french
field
hospital
at
the
time
the
newspaper
account
of
their
adventures
went
to
press
neither
were
badly
hurt
but
they
were
extremely
weak
from
lack
of
food
and
loss
of
blood
to
say
nothing
of
old
wounds
scarcely
healed
when
they
had
started
on
their
dash
for
freedom
the
russian
officer
said
to
be
a
nephew
of
prince
sanzanow
russia
ambassador
to
england
considered
that
he
owed
his
life
to
the
aviator
and
it
was
believed
that
when
the
two
were
able
to
move
they
would
be
brought
to
a
private
convalescent
home
in
london
financed
by
the
russian
ambassadress
and
other
great
ladies
i
was
so
happy
for
the
rest
of
the
day
that
as
i
could
tell
no
one
what
was
in
my
heart
i
sang
to
myself
under
my
breath
it
a
long
long
way
to
tipperary
eagle
was
alive
and
safe
after
all
my
black
fears
and
i
felt
sure
that
if
he
came
to
england
i
should
meet
him
he
could
not
say
now
that
he
had
done
nothing
worth
while
i
thought
too
that
he
would
see
the
time
had
come
at
last
to
let
the
world
know
that
monsieur
mars
and
captain
eagleston
march
were
one
i
longed
for
the
day
of
revelation
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
great
day
i
could
hardly
wait
for
it
to
arrive
but
a
fortnight
passed
and
the
papers
had
no
more
to
say
of
mars
the
elusive
meanwhile
the
world
had
been
busily
making
history
for
its
future
generations
and
momentous
things
had
been
happening
to
almost
every
one
i
knew
except
myself
and
my
own
immediate
circle
since
i
had
first
met
milly
at
diana
many
weeks
ago
and
had
been
shown
the
letter
from
stefan
he
had
actually
arrived
in
england
from
archangel
whence
gossip
said
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
other
russians
had
been
mysteriously
shipped
to
north
britain
alas
for
romance
those
russian
hordes
were
imaginary
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
milly
dalziel
russian
had
appeared
in
flesh
and
blood
though
with
only
enough
of
either
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
they
had
been
married
a
few
days
after
count
stefan
stefanovitch
had
arrived
a
picturesque
wedding
performed
with
all
formalities
by
a
russian
priest
while
the
bridegroom
lay
propped
up
in
bed
in
that
suite
at
the
savoy
of
which
dalziel
had
talked
no
guests
present
except
the
bride
mother
and
father
tony
senior
having
obediently
dashed
across
the
ocean
and
the
russian
ambassador
with
his
wife
at
the
time
i
was
not
unselfish
enough
to
interest
myself
profoundly
in
milly
marriage
for
my
mind
was
filled
with
thoughts
of
eagle
march
and
i
could
not
forget
how
milly
snubbed
by
him
for
her
own
good
had
let
her
supposed
love
for
eagle
turn
into
bitter
spite
i
did
believe
that
a
girl
who
had
so
lately
cared
for
a
man
like
eagle
march
could
really
have
been
caught
in
a
rebound
of
heart
by
stefan
stefanovitch
i
had
seen
stefan
no
more
than
once
or
twice
when
he
was
military
attaché
at
the
russian
embassy
but
that
was
often
enough
for
me
to
know
some
of
his
limitations
in
looks
and
manner
he
compared
poorly
with
eagle
to
my
mind
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
without
his
counthood
milly
would
have
had
no
use
for
him
or
he
for
her
without
her
money
this
spoilt
the
romance
of
the
affair
in
my
eyes
and
i
had
no
premonition
of
what
milly
russian
relationships
were
soon
to
mean
for
me
when
she
had
been
married
a
little
more
than
a
fortnight
and
before
any
further
news
had
come
out
concerning
the
elusive
mars
and
his
companion
i
was
told
one
day
by
miss
jane
that
i
was
called
for
at
the
telephone
i
left
a
roomful
of
baby
belgians
for
whom
i
was
playing
nursemaid
to
run
to
the
and
was
stabbed
with
disappointment
to
hear
diana
voice
you
see
every
rap
of
the
postman
every
of
the
telephone
bell
mean
the
message
from
eagle
which
always
i
hoped
for
even
expected
hello
peggy
said
di
i
got
a
piece
of
good
news
for
you
my
heart
gave
a
silly
leap
and
then
sat
down
again
because
she
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
give
me
news
of
eagle
march
what
is
it
i
asked
without
interest
princess
sanzanow
has
forgotten
you
and
sends
you
a
special
message
princess
sanzanow
is
the
wife
of
the
russian
ambassador
she
giving
quite
an
informal
dinner
di
went
on
getting
it
up
almost
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
because
the
doctor
says
that
stefan
is
well
enough
to
go
out
and
the
affair
is
really
for
him
and
milly
i
do
think
there
be
many
there
except
ourselves
for
the
princess
is
asking
every
one
verbally
that
why
she
sends
you
a
message
instead
of
a
card
it
is
to
say
that
she
has
always
admired
petite
lady
peggy
and
now
more
than
ever
i
happened
to
tell
her
about
your
liége
experience
and
your
work
for
the
belgians
she
particularly
wants
me
to
bring
you
to
dinner
with
her
and
the
prince
night
come
of
course
oh
i
do
know
if
i
can
i
hesitated
there
so
much
to
do
here
and
anyhow
i
have
a
frock
miss
jane
and
miss
emma
bought
me
lots
of
nice
things
when
they
bought
their
own
for
of
course
they
lost
their
luggage
too
but
we
never
so
much
as
thought
of
evening
dresses
i
forgotten
their
existence
but
you
go
di
persisted
the
trunk
you
stored
at
norfolk
street
for
ballyconal
has
been
brought
here
with
father
and
things
celestine
can
take
the
measurements
of
some
frock
or
other
you
packed
away
there
and
i
go
out
and
choose
a
pretty
model
gown
ready
to
wear
for
a
present
to
you
shoes
and
gloves
you
can
get
yourself
i
suppose
if
you
come
here
early
to
dress
celestine
can
take
tucks
and
change
hooks
in
next
to
no
time
if
necessary
i
accepted
for
you
and
it
will
be
horribly
rude
to
the
princess
if
you
refuse
now
for
no
reason
at
all
i
could
have
found
or
invented
a
reason
if
i
had
remembered
in
a
sudden
flash
that
monsieur
mars
companion
in
flight
was
supposed
to
be
a
nephew
of
prince
sanzanow
if
i
went
to
the
embassy
i
might
hear
news
i
was
willing
to
do
almost
anything
for
that
hope
even
to
dressing
at
sidney
vandyke
house
and
continuing
the
armed
truce
in
his
automobile
to
our
destination
but
i
drew
the
line
at
accepting
a
frock
bought
with
his
money
why
yes
i
forgotten
the
trunk
i
packed
up
with
winter
things
for
ballyconal
i
answered
there
that
white
chiffon
velvet
gown
made
over
from
yours
which
i
wore
in
new
york
last
spring
before
the
weather
turned
hot
do
you
remember
it
will
do
beautifully
for
night
i
sure
it
as
good
as
ever
so
you
need
buy
me
anything
many
thanks
and
i
so
glad
you
spoke
of
the
trunk
i
have
it
brought
up
here
afterward
it
small
and
wo
take
up
much
room
there
are
lots
of
things
in
it
i
can
spare
for
our
belgian
women
very
well
as
you
like
said
di
that
white
velvet
was
quite
nice
and
will
be
all
right
if
it
is
not
full
of
beggar
creases
you
can
have
the
little
trunk
put
on
the
luggage
carrier
of
the
car
night
when
we
send
you
back
to
fitzjohn
avenue
it
will
save
the
trouble
of
getting
carter
paterson
or
some
one
else
to
call
here
for
it
and
that
reminds
me
one
of
the
things
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
was
this
you
were
asking
bally
if
he
had
any
old
clothes
to
spare
you
for
your
belgian
women
husbands
well
kitty
has
found
a
few
but
there
are
a
whole
heap
of
sidney
things
you
can
have
if
you
want
them
masses
of
luggage
have
just
arrived
from
america
boxes
of
books
and
rugs
and
trunks
full
of
clothing
packed
up
and
sent
after
him
by
his
when
sid
definitely
decided
to
resign
and
live
over
here
all
the
clothes
are
a
bit
out
of
date
now
or
sidney
thinks
so
and
there
are
some
army
things
he
never
wants
to
see
any
more
anyhow
he
has
collected
quantities
of
new
clothes
and
if
you
would
like
the
american
things
for
your
men
protégés
you
welcome
to
them
it
went
against
the
grain
with
me
to
accept
even
this
favour
from
the
enemy
but
i
reflected
hastily
that
i
had
no
right
to
refuse
what
would
do
good
to
others
after
all
it
was
nothing
to
me
and
sidney
could
not
help
realizing
that
if
he
heard
of
the
transaction
i
thanked
di
again
and
said
i
should
be
glad
of
anything
she
had
to
give
as
the
destitution
among
the
men
of
the
belgian
refugees
was
as
pitiful
as
among
the
women
we
shall
be
thankful
to
get
the
collection
out
of
the
house
answered
diana
sid
man
unpacked
the
boxes
and
of
course
was
free
to
choose
what
he
wanted
for
himself
but
he
such
a
little
monkey
none
of
the
clothes
would
fit
him
i
remembered
you
and
your
poor
people
which
i
think
was
rather
sweet
of
me
as
i
have
such
crowds
of
things
to
do
every
moment
so
i
told
sykes
to
spread
the
lot
out
in
that
empty
room
we
have
furnished
yet
directly
over
mine
i
mean
to
have
it
turned
into
a
kind
of
for
sid
so
the
sooner
we
can
sweep
away
the
boxes
and
mess
generally
the
better
suppose
you
look
in
after
the
dinner
at
the
embassy
night
and
pick
out
what
you
fancy
sykes
can
dump
everything
into
an
empty
trunk
for
you
and
it
can
be
put
with
yours
on
the
back
of
the
for
you
to
cart
off
to
hampstead
i
knew
that
if
i
wished
to
make
sure
of
the
booty
i
had
better
take
di
at
her
word
for
as
likely
as
not
she
would
change
her
mind
in
a
day
or
two
and
offer
the
things
to
somebody
else
i
replied
that
i
thought
her
plan
a
very
good
one
and
i
would
carry
it
out
exactly
as
she
proposed
the
next
evening
i
went
early
to
park
lane
in
order
to
unearth
the
white
velvet
frock
from
the
old
trunk
packed
for
ireland
and
dress
myself
in
it
when
it
was
found
talking
to
kitty
and
di
delayed
me
for
a
few
minutes
however
so
that
i
had
no
time
to
waste
when
i
ran
up
to
the
shuttered
room
where
my
little
trunk
as
well
as
sidney
things
from
america
were
in
temporary
storage
no
one
could
be
spared
to
help
me
as
di
maid
and
kitty
had
already
begun
to
lay
out
their
mistresses
things
for
dinner
but
i
have
been
used
all
my
life
to
looking
after
myself
i
did
in
the
least
mind
grubbing
on
my
knees
to
unlock
the
box
finding
the
dress
i
wanted
and
unwrapping
it
from
layers
of
tissue
paper
as
i
stood
up
to
shake
the
frock
and
examine
anxiously
as
to
its
condition
by
the
light
of
the
electric
lamp
which
i
had
switched
on
for
the
purpose
i
saw
many
suits
of
sidney
clothes
neatly
folded
by
sykes
his
valet
and
piled
on
tables
and
boxes
it
was
too
late
then
to
look
at
the
things
before
dressing
but
i
cast
an
appraising
glance
in
their
direction
and
my
eyes
lit
upon
what
seemed
to
be
a
khaki
uniform
bundled
ignominiously
between
a
suit
of
evening
clothes
and
a
crimson
fancy
his
not
having
sentiment
enough
to
keep
his
army
things
i
thought
scornfully
but
of
course
he
was
never
a
real
soldier
at
heart
or
he
would
have
resigned
at
his
age
to
be
lazy
and
please
diana
how
different
from
but
i
would
let
myself
even
eagle
name
in
that
connection
fortunately
i
had
packed
away
the
white
chiffon
velvet
with
unusual
care
for
me
and
there
were
few
creases
in
the
soft
folds
which
disappear
eventually
when
i
had
put
the
frock
on
as
i
dressed
in
a
far
corner
of
di
room
well
out
of
her
way
and
that
of
her
maid
celestine
and
managing
my
toilet
operations
as
best
i
could
with
a
small
hand
glass
my
thoughts
would
fly
back
to
that
old
khaki
uniform
upstairs
i
wondered
if
it
were
one
sidney
had
worn
in
camp
in
texas
days
when
his
jealous
rage
was
piling
up
against
eagle
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
must
be
an
evil
influence
hanging
about
those
clothes
of
his
and
i
was
still
thinking
this
when
major
vandyke
father
diana
and
kitty
and
i
were
bunched
together
a
rather
silent
party
in
di
big
roomy
town
car
spinning
from
park
lane
to
the
russian
embassy
with
kitchener
night
lights
fanning
long
white
arms
across
the
sky
of
unnaturally
darkened
london
as
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
small
informal
dinner
we
arrived
promptly
on
the
hour
and
when
princess
sanzanow
a
beautiful
tall
woman
with
the
mysterious
sad
eyes
of
the
slav
people
had
greeted
us
she
said
that
four
of
her
guests
had
still
to
arrive
count
and
countess
stefanovitch
and
two
others
whose
presence
was
to
be
the
surprise
of
the
evening
i
will
tell
you
only
she
laughed
in
her
pretty
english
when
di
pretended
to
be
wildly
curious
like
stefan
they
have
both
come
back
from
the
front
and
they
are
the
most
exciting
heroes
i
wo
dream
of
spoiling
my
great
by
letting
you
guess
their
names
until
they
are
announced
but
this
you
shall
know
dear
lady
diana
my
two
are
to
have
the
honour
of
taking
you
and
our
bride
in
to
dinner
all
the
other
women
will
be
envying
you
both
di
was
pleased
and
interested
she
realized
that
our
hostess
meant
to
pay
her
as
well
as
milly
a
great
compliment
for
those
other
women
of
whom
the
princess
spoke
were
important
socially
and
charming
in
themselves
what
she
had
called
a
small
informal
dinner
would
be
made
up
of
guests
and
the
informality
would
consist
in
the
innovation
of
having
small
tables
the
princess
introduced
me
to
a
very
young
youth
her
son
who
had
been
away
at
eton
when
i
had
visited
at
the
embassy
before
he
began
at
once
to
air
his
grievance
of
lacking
a
year
of
the
age
when
a
man
can
be
allowed
to
serve
his
country
and
i
was
sympathizing
with
him
because
he
was
not
fighting
when
milly
and
her
husband
were
announced
she
was
looking
prettier
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
with
quite
new
airs
and
graces
of
a
married
woman
and
a
countess
and
stefan
though
extremely
plain
of
face
and
insignificant
of
figure
was
interesting
because
of
his
experiences
his
limp
and
his
right
arm
in
a
black
silk
sling
milly
seemed
to
think
that
she
and
her
husband
were
the
guests
of
the
evening
and
apologized
in
a
high
voice
for
being
late
but
the
princess
reassured
her
we
have
still
two
more
to
come
our
two
surprises
and
she
was
going
on
to
excite
milly
curiosity
as
she
had
diana
when
the
magnificent
russian
butler
who
looked
as
if
he
had
stepped
from
some
medieval
picture
cried
aloud
two
names
major
baron
skobeleff
captain
march
chapter
xxii
my
blood
so
flew
to
my
head
that
for
a
second
or
two
i
was
giddy
and
saw
nothing
through
the
rain
of
sparks
which
hung
like
a
veil
before
my
eyes
but
in
an
instant
i
came
to
myself
wrenched
back
to
a
clear
vision
of
things
by
sheer
necessity
to
act
somebody
would
have
to
do
something
if
the
situation
were
not
to
ruin
the
princess
whole
evening
and
after
all
he
had
suffered
whatever
happened
eagle
march
must
be
saved
from
the
pain
of
public
humiliation
yet
who
was
to
do
anything
who
was
to
save
him
only
a
few
persons
knew
that
to
arrange
a
meeting
between
sidney
vandyke
diana
milly
and
captain
eagleston
march
was
about
as
tactful
as
to
invite
the
king
of
belgium
to
dine
with
the
german
kaiser
only
a
few
persons
knew
and
those
most
concerned
were
the
very
ones
who
would
do
least
to
shield
eagle
feelings
the
princess
began
gayly
to
explain
that
here
was
her
great
surprise
at
last
the
two
heroes
of
whose
classic
escape
the
whole
world
had
heard
the
elusive
mars
as
he
had
been
called
was
in
reality
captain
march
who
had
refused
to
make
use
any
longer
of
his
de
but
in
the
midst
of
explanations
as
she
would
gently
have
led
eagle
toward
diana
oh
horror
she
had
evidently
planned
to
send
these
two
in
to
dinner
together
suddenly
she
realized
that
some
freezing
spell
had
turned
her
principal
guests
to
figures
of
ice
eagle
struck
with
deadly
pallor
under
the
brown
mask
sun
and
wind
had
given
him
stiffened
involuntarily
and
held
back
sidney
had
gone
crimson
and
then
diana
with
a
shocked
face
drained
of
colour
looked
ready
to
faint
while
milly
in
all
her
new
pride
of
importance
flung
up
her
head
and
stared
insultingly
this
transformation
had
taken
place
with
the
announcement
of
the
names
and
it
took
prince
and
princess
sanzanow
no
longer
than
is
needed
in
the
counting
one
two
three
to
notice
it
living
all
their
lives
in
an
atmosphere
of
diplomacy
as
they
did
even
their
great
tact
and
presence
of
mind
failed
for
a
few
dismal
seconds
to
cope
with
the
emergency
it
being
so
utterly
unforeseen
and
such
a
blow
to
them
that
their
cherished
surprise
should
be
not
only
a
dead
failure
but
a
brutal
catastrophe
they
must
have
realized
in
a
flash
that
these
people
whom
they
had
brought
together
were
bitter
enemies
they
must
in
a
rush
of
emotion
have
blamed
themselves
and
each
other
for
not
finding
out
in
time
what
perhaps
they
might
have
suspected
or
known
without
telling
had
they
not
been
foreigners
and
comparative
strangers
in
london
society
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
could
not
have
known
unless
they
had
catechized
americans
which
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
them
to
do
but
no
doubt
the
thought
came
to
their
minds
and
they
must
have
cursed
their
inspiration
for
that
pleasant
surprise
i
saw
princess
sanzanow
eyes
appeal
in
despair
to
her
husband
but
the
situation
was
too
complicated
even
for
him
to
solve
in
a
second
for
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
thinking
to
compliment
di
and
honour
the
man
who
had
brought
their
nephew
out
of
captivity
they
had
arranged
that
captain
march
should
take
lady
diana
vandyke
in
to
dinner
the
expression
on
her
face
and
the
stiffening
of
his
muscles
had
shown
this
plan
to
be
impossible
to
say
nothing
of
major
vandyke
glare
now
at
an
instant
warning
there
would
have
to
be
a
general
post
and
changing
of
partners
and
the
most
desperate
difficulty
of
all
must
have
lain
in
the
princess
complete
ignorance
of
the
facts
she
stood
there
among
the
company
she
had
invited
to
meet
each
other
as
if
blindfolded
not
knowing
which
ones
or
how
many
were
affected
by
the
vendetta
i
saw
and
divined
this
between
two
heartbeats
for
i
was
one
of
those
who
knew
the
undercurrents
hidden
from
strangers
and
in
such
moments
one
thinks
quickly
of
all
the
guests
i
was
the
least
important
and
the
youngest
except
the
sanzanow
boy
yet
i
felt
that
i
was
the
only
person
present
who
could
or
would
act
in
time
i
made
up
my
mind
to
risk
seeming
rude
or
shockingly
bold
there
was
just
one
thing
i
could
think
of
to
do
and
i
did
it
into
the
midst
of
that
brief
freezing
pause
i
plunged
almost
running
forward
i
held
out
both
hands
to
eagle
oh
dear
princess
i
gasped
we
are
the
best
and
oldest
friends
captain
march
and
i
we
known
each
other
since
since
i
was
a
child
and
we
met
in
belgium
when
he
was
mars
eagle
grasped
my
hands
so
tightly
that
i
should
have
had
to
cry
out
if
i
had
worn
rings
and
princess
sanzanow
gave
me
such
a
look
of
touching
gratitude
that
i
was
sure
i
had
been
lucky
enough
to
do
the
right
thing
oh
i
am
so
glad
she
breathed
then
if
you
are
great
friends
you
will
want
to
go
in
to
dinner
together
and
i
must
let
you
do
so
she
had
the
air
of
having
just
been
saved
from
drowning
and
i
was
the
straw
which
had
thrust
itself
out
in
the
nick
of
time
for
her
to
catch
having
accomplished
my
mission
as
a
straw
i
gave
my
attention
wholly
to
eagle
but
though
i
tried
not
to
notice
i
was
dimly
conscious
all
the
same
of
what
was
going
on
around
me
i
saw
major
skobeleff
the
young
russian
officer
whose
escape
eagle
had
aided
prince
nephew
talking
to
milly
and
noticed
that
stefan
stefanovitch
had
been
given
to
di
as
a
substitute
for
captain
march
somehow
or
other
the
princess
juggled
her
guests
about
so
that
three
minutes
after
the
crash
when
dinner
was
announced
all
could
set
to
partners
without
confusion
there
was
a
french
duchess
a
refugee
from
paris
present
whom
the
prince
had
to
take
in
and
the
princess
had
the
duke
that
arrangement
could
be
upset
and
the
only
quite
ridiculous
effect
of
the
whirlwind
was
to
give
young
prince
paul
to
a
widow
old
enough
to
be
his
grandmother
i
had
rushed
into
talk
with
eagle
before
we
stopped
shaking
hands
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
answer
the
call
of
conventionality
so
soon
and
it
was
not
till
after
we
were
seated
at
table
that
he
could
control
himself
to
speak
on
his
other
side
was
prince
paul
elderly
dinner
companion
on
my
other
side
was
the
new
military
attaché
who
had
taken
the
count
place
in
the
embassy
a
man
past
the
soldiering
age
and
as
he
had
madame
pavlova
to
talk
to
for
him
i
did
not
exist
eagle
and
i
could
speak
to
each
other
as
if
we
were
alone
together
in
a
forest
haunted
with
voices
what
a
fool
i
was
to
come
here
he
said
i
ought
to
have
known
do
be
sorry
i
whispered
think
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
and
there
no
reason
no
reason
in
the
world
why
you
should
wish
to
keep
out
of
way
you
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
but
very
proud
i
glad
to
see
you
again
he
answered
do
imagine
i
not
but
i
meant
to
see
you
anyhow
i
known
for
weeks
where
you
were
i
made
that
kind
old
parson
who
piloted
you
home
promise
to
wire
to
an
address
i
gave
when
you
got
safely
back
to
england
and
afterward
he
wrote
to
tell
me
what
fine
work
you
were
doing
this
is
the
first
time
i
been
out
anywhere
except
for
an
invalid
crawl
or
two
it
only
three
days
since
we
left
the
nursing
home
in
fitzroy
square
where
prince
and
princess
sanzanow
visited
us
several
times
skobeleff
is
their
nephew
you
know
they
asked
us
both
to
stay
with
them
and
skobeleff
is
being
moved
here
by
his
servant
but
i
made
an
excuse
not
to
come
said
it
would
hurt
the
feelings
of
an
old
friend
who
had
offered
to
lend
me
his
chambers
in
whitehall
court
to
finish
getting
well
in
the
sanzanows
would
take
a
refusal
for
dinner
this
evening
though
it
made
no
difference
my
telling
them
who
i
really
am
march
instead
of
mars
i
thought
they
were
sure
to
know
something
of
my
story
they
said
when
i
tried
to
cry
off
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
small
dinner
just
a
few
friends
who
would
like
to
meet
skobeleff
and
me
so
i
let
myself
be
persuaded
this
is
the
result
as
we
spoke
together
the
conversation
around
us
murmured
vaguely
in
my
ears
i
heard
it
without
listening
as
one
can
hear
an
undertone
of
murmuring
sea
beneath
all
other
sounds
people
were
talking
of
the
one
inevitable
subject
the
war
with
variations
the
new
patriotism
which
has
made
the
tory
lion
and
the
liberal
lamb
lie
down
together
in
peace
side
by
side
paying
each
other
compliments
the
tactics
of
the
suffragettes
the
surprising
slump
in
murders
and
every
sort
of
crime
possible
raids
of
zeppelins
and
the
amusingly
persistent
legend
of
russians
in
france
the
same
things
which
were
being
discussed
at
that
very
moment
no
doubt
in
every
household
high
and
low
from
one
end
of
great
britain
to
the
other
but
always
new
and
ever
interesting
yesterday
and
i
glanced
at
di
and
major
vandyke
and
milly
to
see
how
they
were
bearing
themselves
and
i
was
not
pleased
with
what
i
saw
the
princess
had
distributed
her
guests
at
three
small
tables
and
of
course
had
separated
di
and
sidney
i
had
to
crane
my
head
round
a
floral
monoplane
which
was
our
centrepiece
to
catch
sight
of
them
at
their
separate
tables
and
even
so
i
had
but
a
glimpse
now
and
then
of
a
profile
but
the
expression
of
those
profiles
and
the
earnest
confidential
way
in
which
they
turned
toward
their
neighbours
convinced
me
that
they
were
not
talking
milly
faced
me
where
i
sat
and
though
the
tables
were
lit
by
wax
candles
which
gave
an
ivory
effect
to
the
women
complexions
the
primrose
light
could
not
subdue
milly
colour
as
a
rule
she
was
rather
pale
but
cheeks
and
ears
were
flushed
deep
rose
colour
she
looked
excited
and
childishly
angry
her
eyes
dilated
and
her
lips
pouting
had
she
not
been
conscious
of
her
new
honours
as
a
married
woman
and
a
countess
i
do
think
she
would
have
dared
display
her
feelings
at
a
of
so
much
importance
once
or
twice
she
stared
with
narrowed
gaze
across
the
room
at
eagle
march
then
turned
to
one
of
her
two
companions
in
such
a
way
as
almost
to
advertise
the
fact
that
she
was
speaking
of
him
she
would
make
little
impression
i
thought
on
major
skobeleff
if
she
tried
to
prejudice
him
against
eagle
but
it
might
be
different
with
the
man
on
her
other
side
who
knew
nothing
of
captain
march
save
what
she
had
to
tell
and
even
skobeleff
though
surely
he
would
not
believe
evil
of
his
comrade
could
not
help
remembering
i
could
imagine
milly
whispering
what
an
awful
for
the
princess
to
have
brought
major
vandyke
and
captain
march
together
in
her
house
where
they
ca
get
away
from
one
another
for
hours
without
being
rude
to
her
and
the
prince
why
the
man
was
such
an
enemy
of
major
vandyke
that
he
actually
betrayed
his
country
in
the
hope
of
ruining
his
superior
officer
it
a
long
story
but
i
can
tell
it
to
you
if
you
like
captain
march
had
to
leave
the
united
states
army
in
the
most
dreadful
disgrace
she
looked
so
like
a
spiteful
cat
that
i
seemed
to
hear
the
words
hissed
out
and
as
the
man
whose
ear
approached
her
lips
was
one
of
the
famous
gossips
of
london
i
could
imagine
too
how
the
story
would
spread
and
grow
milly
would
certainly
tell
prince
and
princess
sanzanow
also
before
she
went
home
what
a
dreadful
thing
they
had
done
in
asking
that
notorious
captain
march
to
be
their
guest
and
especially
to
meet
major
and
lady
diana
vandyke
sidney
too
if
he
could
pile
anything
more
on
the
injuries
of
the
past
would
be
sure
to
do
his
best
as
i
thought
these
thoughts
my
cheeks
began
to
burn
even
more
hotly
than
milly
i
had
been
questioning
eagle
about
his
adventures
and
he
had
been
answering
in
the
laconic
way
most
brave
men
have
when
teased
to
talk
of
themselves
but
for
a
minute
keen
though
i
was
i
lost
the
thread
of
narrative
i
had
begun
eagerly
drawing
out
this
was
when
i
met
milly
eyes
and
flung
a
challenge
from
mine
to
hers
dare
to
hurt
him
with
your
lying
tongue
and
somehow
surely
as
you
live
i
make
you
repent
do
dream
that
my
affection
for
tony
can
stand
between
you
and
me
was
the
warning
i
sent
silently
we
defied
each
other
in
the
savage
and
primitive
way
which
we
female
human
things
have
merely
modernized
not
modified
since
the
days
of
lilith
up
to
the
days
of
suffragettes
i
was
asking
myself
what
punishment
i
could
devise
and
inflict
if
necessary
to
fit
crime
and
how
i
so
small
and
powerless
could
dig
myself
into
a
defensive
trench
between
eagle
and
sidney
vandyke
when
i
realized
that
eagle
eyes
were
studying
my
flushed
face
they
were
sad
eyes
yet
there
was
a
faint
glint
of
laughter
in
them
you
little
fighter
he
said
you
never
throw
down
the
cudgels
taken
up
in
my
defence
no
and
never
will
i
answered
defiance
in
my
voice
even
for
him
because
my
blood
had
been
set
on
fire
and
the
flame
would
not
die
down
you
very
young
he
said
with
a
faint
sigh
so
young
that
you
have
learnt
not
to
hurl
yourself
against
stone
walls
learn
the
lesson
from
me
child
public
opinion
is
a
stone
wall
the
thickest
and
highest
in
the
world
the
tiny
bubble
of
my
reputation
was
wafted
against
it
by
an
evil
wind
and
burst
forever
if
i
was
fool
enough
once
to
hope
that
i
could
mend
it
i
know
now
that
i
was
mistaken
broken
bubbles
are
like
humpty
dumpty
they
ca
be
put
together
again
and
i
do
mean
to
break
my
head
in
the
place
where
the
bubble
burst
or
let
you
break
yours
we
sha
break
heads
said
i
we
break
other
wicked
heads
that
deserve
to
be
broken
and
they
aching
hard
already
with
sheer
rage
because
you
made
a
beautiful
new
bubble
for
yourself
ever
so
much
bigger
and
brighter
than
the
old
one
they
tried
to
burst
only
because
they
may
find
that
it
did
smash
when
it
seemed
to
then
if
the
old
bubble
is
saved
there
be
two
solid
as
crystal
and
brilliant
as
rainbows
bubbles
that
will
come
blowing
back
to
break
the
brutes
who
wanted
to
burst
them
captain
march
laughed
out
aloud
and
i
saw
sidney
turn
involuntarily
with
a
slight
nervous
start
as
if
he
fancied
that
the
laugh
must
be
directed
against
him
irish
peggy
you
inimitable
said
eagle
look
out
for
your
metaphors
or
you
be
turning
my
bubble
into
a
bull
hang
metaphors
i
retorted
i
wish
i
turn
the
bubble
into
a
bull
not
an
irish
but
a
wild
one
and
it
at
two
or
three
people
perhaps
i
shall
yet
and
what
has
made
you
suddenly
change
your
mind
eagle
at
liége
in
hospital
you
told
me
how
you
hated
sidney
vandyke
and
felt
as
if
you
could
choke
his
life
out
i
have
changed
my
mind
he
said
i
hate
vandyke
now
as
i
hated
him
then
more
if
possible
that
not
christian
but
i
ca
help
it
or
else
i
do
try
to
help
it
i
not
sure
which
if
by
killing
vandyke
i
could
get
back
what
he
took
from
me
i
should
do
my
best
to
kill
him
but
i
am
just
cool
enough
where
he
is
concerned
to
realize
that
i
ca
help
myself
by
hurting
him
rather
the
contrary
that
where
we
come
to
the
stone
wall
so
i
not
going
to
smash
what
he
has
left
of
my
head
on
the
stones
he
piled
up
against
me
to
do
that
would
be
giving
the
enemy
great
satisfaction
would
it
perhaps
i
had
to
agree
with
a
sigh
but
if
the
circumstances
ever
change
in
my
favour
eagle
went
on
his
pleasant
face
hardening
into
grimness
and
i
can
get
revenge
without
putting
myself
in
the
wrong
god
help
vandyke
i
hope
he
help
him
when
that
time
comes
i
exclaimed
and
i
believe
it
will
come
something
often
tells
me
so
tells
me
that
i
that
you
what
eagle
prompted
me
as
i
broke
off
that
i
shall
have
some
hand
in
the
the
retribution
whatever
it
may
be
it
what
i
always
pray
for
eagle
gazed
straight
at
me
with
eyes
which
had
changed
sadly
since
the
day
they
first
met
mine
in
the
wardour
street
shop
i
had
thought
them
full
of
romance
and
dreams
then
their
look
was
harder
and
older
now
the
look
of
a
man
who
has
been
down
very
near
to
the
gates
of
hell
and
by
desperate
fighting
has
battled
his
way
up
the
heights
again
but
not
so
high
as
to
forget
the
red
glare
that
singed
his
eyeballs
my
heart
ached
because
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
peace
of
dreams
and
romance
could
ever
come
back
i
was
glad
glad
that
eagle
heart
softened
toward
sidney
vandyke
who
was
as
bitterly
his
enemy
as
ever
but
i
was
sorrowful
because
the
beautiful
youth
of
a
man
soul
had
been
scorched
in
the
furnace
fire
i
ca
bear
to
think
your
friendship
for
me
should
harden
or
embitter
you
peggy
eagle
said
nothing
is
worth
that
i
ought
to
talk
to
you
as
i
been
talking
now
i
sha
again
forgive
me
and
forget
help
to
forget
forgetfulness
is
the
best
thing
that
can
happen
to
me
now
i
realize
that
in
my
sensible
moments
but
it
hard
to
be
sensible
always
how
i
wished
i
could
help
him
even
in
so
small
and
humble
a
fashion
at
least
i
could
try
to
draw
his
thoughts
away
for
the
moment
from
the
unhealed
wound
violently
torn
open
it
was
a
temptation
to
dwell
on
it
to
look
at
it
and
feed
my
anger
but
on
his
wistful
hint
i
threw
the
temptation
off
instead
of
returning
to
our
interrupted
talk
of
his
adventures
as
i
wished
to
do
i
answered
eagle
questions
about
life
at
the
haven
and
told
him
pathetic
or
funny
stories
of
our
refugees
i
getting
to
be
quite
a
weird
combination
of
red
cross
nurse
and
nursemaid
i
said
i
really
ought
to
design
some
special
sort
of
costume
suited
to
my
but
i
never
had
time
to
think
one
out
yet
meanwhile
i
wear
a
badge
which
keeps
up
my
courage
and
gives
me
back
my
strength
whenever
i
tired
you
guess
what
it
is
the
flag
of
the
allies
he
ventured
no
the
chevron
you
gave
me
when
you
made
me
your
corporal
do
you
remember
i
saw
by
his
eyes
that
he
was
touched
a
gleam
of
the
old
light
flashed
into
them
and
brightened
his
smile
do
i
remember
he
echoed
yes
i
remember
peggy
only
too
well
and
i
remember
the
day
you
flew
with
me
from
hendon
in
the
poor
old
heaven
rest
her
ashes
the
day
when
when
lady
diana
failed
me
and
your
pluck
and
presence
of
mind
saved
us
both
from
coming
to
grief
i
remember
lots
of
other
things
you
probably
forgotten
and
i
use
the
memories
for
balm
i
had
to
look
down
suddenly
to
hide
the
tears
that
stung
my
eyelids
but
i
winked
them
away
in
an
instant
and
was
bracing
myself
to
make
him
laugh
by
mimicking
the
man
who
had
introduced
us
nebuchadnezzar
of
wardour
street
when
great
hothouse
peaches
and
amethyst
bunches
of
grapes
were
brought
by
the
footman
i
knew
that
soon
princess
sanzanow
would
smile
at
the
french
duchess
and
we
should
all
troop
away
to
leave
the
men
i
was
sure
that
eagle
would
not
join
the
ladies
conventionally
in
the
and
i
did
not
want
that
summons
to
mean
a
long
i
asked
hastily
therefore
if
he
would
come
and
see
me
and
the
miss
splatchleys
and
our
belgians
at
the
haven
when
he
had
grown
a
little
stronger
i
strong
enough
now
he
said
write
to
tell
me
when
i
may
come
and
let
it
be
soon
for
the
minute
i
fit
i
shall
go
back
to
the
front
of
course
of
course
i
repeated
firmly
though
my
heart
felt
as
if
it
had
been
squeezed
by
a
mailed
fist
i
will
write
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
send
you
a
formal
written
invitation
from
dear
miss
emma
and
miss
jane
do
my
address
is
whitehall
court
you
wo
forget
will
you
no
i
wo
forget
i
assured
him
with
a
secret
smile
because
i
shall
beg
the
princess
as
she
passes
to
forgive
me
if
i
go
without
bidding
her
farewell
in
the
being
a
bit
of
a
crock
still
gives
me
a
good
excuse
and
she
understand
and
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
me
even
as
he
spoke
the
signal
i
been
expecting
was
given
by
our
hostess
we
all
rose
smiling
at
our
neighbours
and
the
men
stood
while
we
women
trailed
to
the
door
i
being
last
of
all
the
guests
saw
the
princess
pause
as
captain
march
took
a
step
forward
and
i
knew
that
he
was
bidding
her
farewell
then
i
went
on
and
in
the
found
di
waiting
to
pounce
anger
for
me
in
her
eyes
a
smile
for
everybody
else
on
her
lips
how
dared
you
she
whispered
how
you
treat
that
man
as
if
he
were
your
best
friend
because
he
is
i
answered
bluntly
then
you
no
friend
of
ours
sidney
and
i
will
forgive
you
for
this
night
trying
to
put
us
both
in
the
wrong
as
you
have
it
an
honour
not
to
be
forgiven
for
that
i
flung
back
at
her
now
i
going
to
tell
the
princess
that
i
have
to
get
back
early
to
my
belgians
and
i
shall
have
a
taxi
called
to
take
me
away
because
after
this
i
ca
even
accept
from
sidney
a
lift
in
his
motor
you
must
accept
it
whispered
diana
furiously
if
only
to
take
the
things
we
giving
you
out
of
his
house
it
his
house
you
know
and
though
you
my
sister
i
ca
expect
him
to
ask
you
into
it
again
as
a
visitor
after
your
deliberate
insult
to
us
both
your
being
no
more
than
a
child
has
excused
some
things
but
it
ca
excuse
this
for
you
have
acted
like
a
child
you
acted
like
a
malicious
woman
and
i
think
we
reached
the
end
i
think
so
too
i
replied
do
be
afraid
i
sha
trouble
either
of
you
after
i
not
go
in
your
motor
but
i
go
to
your
house
and
fetch
my
trunk
as
for
the
things
you
were
giving
to
the
refugees
i
take
them
or
not
as
you
like
i
like
to
have
the
rubbish
out
of
the
way
and
see
the
last
of
it
said
diana
and
looked
as
if
she
would
gladly
see
the
last
of
me
i
apologized
prettily
to
the
princess
explaining
how
early
were
the
hours
of
the
haven
and
how
much
there
was
to
do
there
she
forgave
me
with
all
her
gracious
charm
pressing
my
hand
as
if
to
show
her
gratitude
for
a
certain
incident
which
could
not
be
mentioned
in
words
and
five
minutes
later
i
was
spinning
alone
in
a
taxi
toward
park
lane
chapter
xxiii
i
had
been
offered
the
help
of
celestine
and
sidney
man
to
make
up
in
parcels
such
clothes
as
i
wished
to
take
for
our
refugees
and
their
menfolk
but
now
i
determined
to
do
all
the
work
myself
the
footman
who
opened
the
showed
no
surprise
or
interest
on
seeing
her
ladyship
sister
arrive
in
advance
of
the
rest
he
listened
respectfully
but
dully
as
i
briefly
explained
my
errand
and
told
him
that
i
should
need
no
help
until
i
rang
for
my
trunk
and
other
things
to
be
carried
downstairs
when
i
had
made
this
clear
i
ran
up
to
the
room
above
diana
and
shut
myself
in
meaning
to
make
such
haste
with
what
i
had
to
do
as
to
escape
with
my
booty
if
possible
before
di
and
her
husband
came
home
i
was
trembling
still
with
excitement
which
clouded
my
mind
and
kept
me
from
thinking
clearly
for
i
was
furiously
angry
and
desperately
sad
at
the
same
time
i
said
to
myself
that
i
did
care
if
i
never
saw
diana
again
yet
my
heart
was
ready
to
break
because
we
had
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
i
thought
i
was
definitely
giving
up
my
family
or
my
family
were
giving
me
up
it
mattered
very
little
which
my
father
had
never
cared
for
me
therefore
i
had
not
cared
for
him
as
most
girls
care
for
their
fathers
di
had
made
use
of
me
but
had
never
loved
me
and
i
had
seen
through
her
ever
since
i
was
a
tiny
child
lately
we
became
almost
as
strangers
and
yet
the
two
had
been
the
only
ones
near
to
me
breaking
with
them
was
like
a
small
figure
in
a
group
on
a
big
canvas
suddenly
loosening
itself
and
falling
off
its
background
a
mere
lonely
bit
of
paint
what
will
become
of
me
i
wondered
i
can
never
go
back
to
ballyconal
now
yet
i
ca
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
with
the
miss
splatchleys
what
shall
i
do
when
i
not
wanted
there
any
more
tears
began
to
drop
slowly
from
my
eyes
then
to
rain
fast
over
the
clothing
i
tried
to
sort
i
knew
it
was
silly
to
think
of
such
things
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
by
and
by
to
arrange
the
future
but
i
could
not
concentrate
my
mind
on
the
work
in
hand
until
as
i
tossed
the
neatly
folded
clothes
about
with
a
kind
of
stupid
aimlessness
i
came
once
more
upon
sidney
vandyke
khaki
uniform
this
i
will
not
take
anyhow
i
decided
it
would
be
of
no
use
and
i
do
believe
it
might
carry
a
curse
with
it
because
of
the
evil
thoughts
of
the
man
who
wore
it
last
i
wish
i
could
burn
it
up
that
i
could
not
do
but
to
show
spite
i
wreaked
such
childish
vengeance
as
i
could
by
dashing
the
uniform
on
to
the
floor
and
proceeding
to
trample
on
the
coat
with
my
white
satin
slippers
as
i
kicked
it
away
in
loathing
at
last
one
of
the
slippers
flew
off
and
seemed
spitefully
to
follow
the
coat
as
if
to
deal
one
final
insult
it
turned
a
somersault
on
the
way
as
defiantly
as
the
had
looped
the
loop
over
german
heads
at
brussels
and
then
plumped
down
on
top
of
the
fallen
garment
landing
with
its
pointed
satin
nose
poked
under
the
flap
of
a
slightly
gaping
i
slipped
my
foot
into
the
shoe
where
it
lay
and
pushing
the
point
still
further
into
the
pocket
thus
lifted
the
coat
on
my
toe
to
give
it
another
disgustful
toss
as
i
did
this
it
seemed
that
something
crackled
with
the
sound
or
the
feel
i
could
hardly
tell
which
of
stiff
paper
then
a
very
strange
thing
happened
to
me
suddenly
i
saw
before
my
eyes
as
clearly
as
though
it
were
really
there
the
notebook
i
had
given
eagle
the
notebook
out
of
which
he
had
torn
a
leaf
with
a
message
written
on
it
for
major
vandyke
i
did
know
i
do
know
now
and
never
shall
what
painted
this
picture
on
my
brain
whether
it
was
the
high
mysterious
power
which
had
been
leading
me
slowly
but
very
surely
to
this
minute
or
whether
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
mental
association
between
a
khaki
coat
worn
by
eagle
enemy
on
that
disastrous
night
and
a
faint
crackle
of
paper
jarring
tensely
on
strung
nerves
i
know
which
i
to
think
but
in
either
case
the
effect
was
the
same
i
saw
the
notebook
i
saw
eagle
hastily
scrawling
his
appeal
for
a
written
order
to
fire
the
guns
i
saw
major
vandyke
wearing
this
coat
read
the
message
crumple
up
the
paper
and
then
then
the
vision
faded
but
the
question
rang
in
my
ears
what
would
he
be
likely
to
do
with
the
paper
what
should
have
done
had
i
been
a
man
in
his
place
would
i
have
torn
the
message
into
bits
and
trusted
to
the
wind
to
scatter
it
no
if
i
meant
to
swear
that
no
such
document
had
ever
reached
me
i
should
have
been
afraid
to
leave
bits
of
paper
lying
about
the
ground
i
should
have
crumpled
the
message
deep
down
in
the
bottom
of
a
pocket
and
burnt
it
later
when
i
was
safe
in
my
own
tent
yes
that
was
what
any
man
as
and
unscrupulous
as
sidney
vandyke
would
have
been
likely
to
do
he
could
not
possibly
have
forgotten
such
a
bit
of
evidence
afterward
and
left
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
instead
of
destroying
it
such
things
could
happen
only
in
the
crudest
melodramas
where
the
actors
were
mere
puppets
for
uncritical
and
ignorant
audiences
to
applaud
it
was
wildly
absurd
to
dream
that
i
might
find
any
hidden
treasure
tucked
away
in
a
of
sidney
vandyke
uniform
and
i
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
it
yet
the
vision
of
the
paper
had
been
so
clear
that
i
dared
not
resist
the
impulse
it
prompted
i
picked
up
the
coat
holding
it
away
from
me
gingerly
by
the
collar
as
a
small
white
cat
might
grip
a
large
brown
rat
by
the
back
of
its
neck
then
also
gingerly
i
dipped
my
fingers
into
one
pocket
after
another
all
were
empty
yet
now
quite
distinctly
i
heard
a
crisp
delicate
crackling
of
paper
it
was
like
searching
for
a
ghost
and
seeing
no
sign
but
catching
a
faint
echo
of
invisible
feet
something
was
hidden
there
i
could
not
be
mistaken
perhaps
the
thing
when
found
would
not
be
worth
finding
but
a
thousand
times
over
it
was
worth
the
pain
of
looking
for
i
cleared
a
place
on
the
large
table
which
had
been
spread
with
contributions
for
the
refugees
and
laid
the
coat
out
flat
all
over
the
two
fronts
i
slowly
carefully
passed
my
fingers
until
between
the
cloth
and
lining
far
down
on
the
left
side
near
the
edge
of
the
coat
i
touched
the
thing
that
crackled
whatever
it
was
this
thing
must
have
slipped
down
through
a
break
in
one
of
the
pockets
i
explored
again
and
discovered
a
small
rip
not
more
than
two
inches
in
length
at
the
bottom
of
the
inside
but
the
lost
bit
of
paper
could
not
be
got
at
through
this
opening
the
lining
of
the
coat
would
have
to
be
slit
down
before
the
hidden
thing
could
be
reached
and
i
pulled
the
pocket
wrong
side
out
hoping
with
a
quick
jerk
to
tear
it
from
the
coat
more
easily
said
than
done
the
material
was
expensively
tough
and
resisted
my
frantic
tuggings
yet
i
would
give
up
i
dared
not
go
foraging
downstairs
for
a
pair
of
scissors
neither
did
i
wish
to
ring
for
a
servant
to
bring
me
them
i
wanted
desperately
to
be
alone
with
this
garment
of
sidney
vandyke
alone
with
any
secret
i
might
force
it
to
yield
up
the
coat
seemed
to
resist
every
effort
and
trick
of
mine
as
if
it
still
served
its
old
master
and
were
stubbornly
resolved
to
protect
him
against
a
stranger
prying
but
at
last
a
sharp
jerk
made
a
stitch
give
way
after
that
the
rest
was
easy
i
wrenched
the
pocket
half
out
and
that
once
done
i
was
able
with
both
hands
to
tear
the
lining
down
nearly
its
whole
length
then
i
thrust
my
hand
between
it
and
the
cloth
and
touched
a
crumpled
piece
of
paper
i
dreaded
while
i
longed
to
look
at
what
i
had
discovered
for
i
realized
that
in
all
human
probability
i
was
about
to
suffer
a
crushing
disappointment
this
lost
scrap
of
paper
might
prove
to
be
part
of
some
torn
irrelevant
letter
of
long
ago
or
it
might
be
an
american
greenback
or
a
forgotten
memorandum
as
i
withdrew
my
hand
the
paper
in
it
involuntarily
i
shut
my
eyes
as
if
shrinking
from
a
blow
but
i
scolded
myself
for
cowardly
weakness
and
opened
my
eyes
again
to
see
a
folded
refolded
and
crumpled
piece
of
paper
ruled
with
blue
lines
then
i
knew
that
from
the
first
faint
crackling
which
i
had
felt
rather
than
heard
i
had
been
sure
in
my
heart
of
finding
this
thing
sure
that
i
had
always
been
meant
by
fate
to
find
it
with
cold
and
shaking
fingers
i
cautiously
unfolded
the
paper
without
tearing
it
yes
it
was
a
leaf
torn
from
a
notebook
the
khaki
notebook
i
had
given
eagle
one
page
was
blank
the
other
was
almost
covered
with
writing
scribbled
with
blue
pencil
a
pencil
which
must
have
been
rather
blunt
because
the
marking
was
heavy
though
it
showed
signs
of
haste
no
one
familiar
with
eagle
march
hand
could
have
failed
to
recognize
it
as
his
rough
and
hurried
as
was
the
scrawl
at
the
top
of
the
page
was
jotted
down
the
date
of
that
unforgettable
night
at
el
paso
have
just
received
by
your
orderly
verbal
command
to
fire
nos
one
and
two
guns
aiming
beyond
mexican
end
of
bridge
i
beg
if
this
is
correct
that
you
repeat
order
in
writing
march
here
was
the
evidence
which
would
have
saved
eagle
at
his
and
proved
major
vandyke
a
liar
and
blackguard
he
had
no
doubt
crushed
the
incriminating
paper
into
the
deepest
depths
of
his
perhaps
covering
it
up
with
other
things
lest
it
should
flutter
away
and
betray
him
there
had
been
no
time
to
destroy
the
paper
at
that
moment
and
so
he
had
put
off
disposing
of
it
until
after
his
famous
rush
across
the
rio
grande
had
been
safely
accomplished
when
he
returned
and
could
get
back
to
his
own
tent
his
first
thought
must
have
been
of
the
document
whose
existence
he
meant
to
deny
to
empty
his
pocket
and
find
the
paper
gone
must
have
been
a
frightful
blow
and
sidney
could
hardly
have
known
a
peaceful
moment
until
after
the
when
all
danger
of
the
lost
message
coming
to
light
seemed
to
be
past
forever
no
wonder
as
tony
had
written
describing
the
trial
that
the
accuser
had
been
more
worn
and
than
the
accused
no
wonder
that
even
when
he
arrived
in
england
sidney
vandyke
had
looked
changed
and
ill
no
wonder
he
had
taken
to
steadying
his
nerves
with
alcohol
and
had
not
tried
to
conquer
the
habit
by
this
time
he
must
have
ceased
to
dread
the
reappearance
of
the
vanished
document
but
it
had
reappeared
and
it
was
not
too
late
to
be
of
use
the
small
scrap
of
paper
in
my
hand
was
big
enough
to
give
me
all
the
power
i
had
prayed
for
the
power
to
prove
captain
innocence
and
major
vandyke
guilt
eagle
said
that
if
the
time
ever
came
when
he
could
take
revenge
without
putting
himself
in
the
wrong
god
help
vandyke
i
remembered
we
little
thought
how
soon
it
would
come
but
it
here
it
here
the
wall
has
tumbled
down
like
the
wall
of
jericho
and
it
sidney
vandyke
head
not
eagle
that
will
be
broken
i
was
almost
out
of
my
wits
with
joy
i
danced
a
of
triumph
swinging
the
khaki
coat
and
waving
the
document
over
my
head
then
when
a
wild
whirl
had
satisfied
my
wish
to
celebrate
i
refolded
the
bit
of
paper
hung
the
coat
over
my
arm
and
dashed
to
the
door
downstairs
i
plunged
passed
diana
room
and
had
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
leading
to
the
ground
floor
when
i
actually
bumped
against
di
coming
up
if
i
had
not
stepped
hastily
back
i
should
have
thrown
her
downstairs
as
it
was
she
caught
at
the
banisters
and
barred
the
way
against
me
the
flashing
glimpse
i
had
caught
of
her
face
before
we
almost
telescoped
like
two
trains
running
into
one
another
had
shown
it
pale
and
depressed
but
the
surprise
of
our
encounter
brought
light
to
her
eyes
and
colour
to
her
cheeks
her
look
changed
from
mere
startled
annoyance
to
puzzled
suspicion
good
gracious
she
exclaimed
one
would
have
thought
the
house
was
on
fire
another
instant
and
you
have
knocked
me
down
what
is
the
matter
with
you
peggy
i
in
a
hurry
that
all
i
answered
what
are
you
doing
with
sidney
coat
over
your
arm
she
catechized
me
sharply
did
you
know
it
was
among
the
upstairs
that
you
were
so
anxious
to
get
rid
of
i
retorted
in
the
same
tone
yes
i
knew
that
but
why
do
you
career
downstairs
with
it
as
if
the
sky
were
falling
and
leave
everything
else
you
tell
me
i
wo
let
you
go
till
you
do
with
the
first
words
she
had
spoken
after
our
collision
di
had
mounted
the
top
step
though
still
guarding
the
way
down
and
with
her
shrill
threat
she
pushed
me
back
from
the
stairhead
by
throwing
herself
against
me
and
at
the
same
time
grasping
the
coat
as
if
to
snatch
it
off
my
arm
diana
is
much
taller
and
stronger
than
i
am
she
could
take
the
coat
from
me
by
force
and
the
thought
darted
through
my
head
that
without
it
to
prove
where
and
how
the
lost
message
had
been
found
the
paper
would
lose
half
its
value
my
word
unsupported
by
proof
would
not
be
enough
against
major
vandyke
for
it
was
known
that
i
detested
him
and
was
a
sworn
friend
to
captain
march
i
must
keep
the
coat
at
any
cost
to
myself
or
even
to
diana
standing
at
bay
looking
up
at
her
white
face
of
anger
and
suspicion
i
felt
very
small
and
frail
of
body
but
my
soul
gathered
strength
of
battle
i
clasped
my
bare
arms
over
the
coat
and
locked
my
fingers
round
my
two
elbows
this
is
mine
i
said
you
gave
it
to
me
to
do
as
i
liked
with
no
right
to
take
it
away
i
going
to
make
a
present
of
it
to
somebody
who
been
robbed
of
everything
and
needs
it
this
was
the
best
explanation
i
could
think
of
but
it
was
not
good
enough
for
diana
she
attempted
to
push
me
farther
back
and
i
resisted
trying
to
wriggle
myself
free
and
elude
her
but
she
was
on
the
alert
and
too
quick
as
well
as
too
strong
for
my
trick
to
succeed
no
you
sha
slip
away
like
that
you
little
she
cried
beginning
to
pant
slightly
in
the
white
light
of
the
electric
candelabra
which
made
the
corridor
bright
as
day
i
saw
her
beautiful
bosom
heave
under
its
double
rope
of
creamy
pearls
all
the
charming
softness
which
men
loved
was
gone
from
her
face
it
looked
hard
and
cruel
just
as
i
meant
to
escape
at
any
price
so
she
meant
at
any
price
to
keep
me
i
guessed
that
she
had
come
home
alone
and
let
herself
in
with
a
for
apparently
there
were
no
servants
about
that
was
fortunate
for
me
and
fortunate
that
father
and
kitty
and
above
all
sidney
had
gone
on
somewhere
else
from
the
russian
embassy
for
there
would
have
been
very
little
chance
for
me
if
i
had
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
you
hate
sidney
i
believe
you
hate
me
too
she
went
on
when
she
had
got
her
breath
i
do
trust
anything
you
say
or
do
you
some
horrid
idea
in
your
head
i
read
that
in
your
face
the
instant
i
saw
you
here
you
mean
mischief
what
in
your
mind
i
do
know
but
i
know
you
better
tell
me
i
told
you
all
i
have
to
tell
i
said
if
i
a
you
a
tigress
what
will
the
servants
think
if
they
come
and
see
you
like
this
i
do
care
what
they
think
and
besides
they
wo
come
changed
my
mind
about
giving
you
that
coat
i
must
ask
sidney
first
if
he
wants
to
keep
it
for
any
reason
i
let
you
know
will
be
too
late
i
to
see
my
man
why
are
you
taking
him
the
coat
and
not
the
rest
of
the
suit
she
persisted
it
only
the
coat
that
will
be
of
use
to
him
i
had
the
answer
ready
without
warning
she
made
another
dive
at
the
coat
to
catch
me
unawares
she
failed
and
my
hold
tightened
but
the
sudden
wrench
twisted
the
thing
partly
wrong
side
out
to
show
the
lining
the
cry
diana
gave
the
horror
that
flashed
in
lightning
from
her
eyes
told
me
what
she
had
seen
what
she
must
have
guessed
my
god
peggy
she
gasped
you
believe
of
him
you
were
seeking
for
but
you
found
nothing
of
course
of
course
you
found
nothing
there
nothing
there
now
i
said
trying
not
to
let
my
voice
tremble
diana
eyes
searched
mine
they
were
dilated
her
face
and
even
her
lips
always
coral
red
were
sickly
pale
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
in
a
low
choked
voice
do
you
mean
that
you
did
find
oh
i
see
now
the
whole
disgraceful
thing
you
were
taking
this
coat
to
eagle
march
you
traitor
i
thank
god
i
came
in
time
she
seized
me
by
both
shoulders
her
white
hands
with
their
nails
and
little
round
dimples
at
the
finger
roots
felt
hard
and
remorseless
as
steel
claws
she
looked
suddenly
capable
of
anything
the
thought
struck
on
my
heart
like
a
that
she
would
stop
at
nothing
to
save
sidney
reputation
for
the
first
time
i
was
afraid
for
myself
i
was
afraid
she
would
be
too
strong
for
me
she
would
push
me
along
the
corridor
and
through
the
open
door
into
her
room
if
i
screamed
she
would
tell
the
servants
i
had
gone
mad
she
would
get
the
coat
away
from
me
she
would
find
the
paper
if
she
had
to
tear
my
clothes
off
to
do
it
once
inside
the
room
she
would
have
all
the
advantage
if
she
could
turn
the
key
and
lock
us
in
together
i
too
was
in
a
mood
to
stop
at
nothing
i
was
fighting
for
the
man
i
loved
she
was
fighting
merely
for
a
man
with
whom
her
fate
was
bound
up
but
in
strength
of
body
i
was
no
match
for
her
it
was
only
in
a
battle
of
wits
that
i
might
have
a
fair
chance
but
on
the
other
side
of
her
door
it
would
be
too
late
to
use
my
brains
it
now
or
never
i
thought
clutching
the
coat
for
dear
life
with
one
hand
with
the
other
i
snatched
at
the
pearls
which
were
the
immediate
jewels
of
my
soul
i
gave
the
double
rope
a
sharp
jerk
and
with
a
snap
the
string
yielded
pearls
spouted
in
all
directions
like
a
creamy
spray
and
with
a
cry
involuntarily
diana
loosened
her
hold
on
me
to
save
them
that
was
my
chance
i
ducked
under
her
arms
and
dashed
downstairs
like
a
streak
of
lightning
before
diana
had
run
halfway
down
i
was
at
the
door
for
an
instant
i
fumbled
in
an
anguish
of
suspense
at
the
catch
then
it
yielded
i
slammed
the
door
in
di
face
and
as
i
was
i
had
taken
off
my
wrap
to
do
the
packing
i
ran
like
a
rabbit
after
a
taxi
i
saw
at
a
little
distance
taxi
taxi
i
called
and
though
my
lips
were
dry
and
my
voice
seemed
to
my
own
ears
almost
inaudible
as
when
one
tries
to
scream
in
a
nightmare
the
man
heard
and
stopped
luckily
the
taxi
was
empty
if
it
had
not
been
things
might
have
ended
differently
for
as
i
scrambled
in
panting
quick
number
whitehall
court
i
saw
with
one
corner
of
my
eye
that
diana
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
out
chapter
xxiv
as
the
taxi
sped
away
with
me
the
relief
was
so
great
that
i
lay
back
on
the
seat
limp
and
half
fainting
i
let
myself
rest
there
revelling
in
safety
after
the
strain
of
danger
nothing
could
keep
me
now
from
eagle
i
told
myself
and
nothing
could
stand
between
him
and
his
righteous
revenge
on
sidney
vandyke
if
he
were
not
at
home
when
i
got
to
whitehall
court
i
would
wait
until
he
came
even
if
i
had
to
sit
in
the
taxi
within
sight
of
his
door
all
night
but
he
be
at
home
i
felt
that
when
he
left
the
russian
embassy
he
had
been
in
no
mood
to
go
anywhere
else
unless
for
a
lonely
walk
and
even
so
he
ought
to
have
got
back
by
this
time
he
had
left
before
i
had
and
i
must
have
arrived
at
diana
an
hour
ago
it
was
only
when
the
taxi
drew
up
in
whitehall
court
that
i
remembered
leaving
my
little
gold
bag
a
present
from
kitty
with
my
discarded
cloak
in
park
lane
all
the
money
i
had
was
in
the
bag
i
could
not
pay
the
chauffeur
but
in
any
case
i
meant
to
keep
him
till
i
learned
whether
or
no
eagle
were
at
home
to
my
chagrin
the
man
looked
dubious
how
long
miss
will
you
want
me
to
wait
he
inquired
i
explained
that
i
could
not
tell
yet
i
must
find
out
whether
the
friend
i
had
come
to
see
were
in
if
not
i
might
need
to
keep
the
taxi
a
long
time
very
sorry
miss
the
chauffeur
replied
but
i
have
an
appointment
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
now
in
downing
street
with
an
official
gentleman
i
serve
pretty
often
i
was
on
the
way
there
when
you
called
me
but
when
you
said
court
i
took
you
up
because
you
seemed
in
a
hurry
and
i
thought
there
was
plenty
of
time
i
supposed
you
was
going
to
stop
here
it
bein
rather
late
in
the
night
for
a
young
lady
but
i
ca
possibly
stay
five
minutes
longer
tell
you
what
i
can
do
i
ask
another
feller
to
come
along
and
wait
for
you
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
had
to
confess
that
i
was
penniless
having
forgotten
my
money
but
here
a
bangle
i
said
slipping
my
one
bit
of
jewellery
off
my
arm
you
can
have
this
for
security
if
you
give
me
your
card
i
send
the
money
and
i
trust
you
to
send
back
the
bangle
i
held
it
out
to
him
a
thin
band
of
gold
with
a
shamrock
made
of
emeralds
a
present
from
tony
which
he
had
implored
me
to
keep
in
memory
of
our
friendship
the
chauffeur
hesitated
evidently
asking
himself
whether
or
no
i
might
be
trusted
without
the
security
as
he
turned
the
bangle
over
in
his
hand
and
the
question
in
his
mind
i
heard
quick
steps
coming
along
the
dark
street
and
looking
up
the
taxi
lights
showed
me
eagle
face
he
was
far
more
surprised
than
i
was
because
it
had
already
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
cool
his
brain
with
a
solitary
stroll
in
the
night
oh
eagle
i
exclaimed
giving
him
hardly
time
to
be
sure
of
recognition
how
thankful
i
am
that
you
appeared
just
at
the
right
minute
i
come
to
see
you
about
something
important
and
i
have
a
penny
no
doubt
eagle
was
astonished
that
i
should
be
arriving
alone
cloakless
at
eleven
or
later
to
call
upon
him
but
after
the
first
look
of
amazement
at
sight
of
me
he
concealed
his
feelings
for
a
second
no
longer
he
hesitated
then
he
said
smiling
i
have
plenty
of
pennies
do
you
think
i
better
get
into
your
taxi
with
you
and
drive
round
for
a
few
minutes
rather
than
you
should
have
the
trouble
of
coming
into
my
place
the
driver
has
an
engagement
i
said
and
anyhow
i
come
in
it
really
serious
eagle
he
argued
no
more
though
he
looked
somewhat
troubled
for
my
sake
i
understood
very
well
his
state
of
mind
he
paid
and
tipped
the
chauffeur
who
handed
back
my
bangle
and
darted
off
were
you
going
to
give
the
fellow
that
eagle
asked
nodding
at
the
gold
band
then
it
must
indeed
be
serious
i
once
heard
you
say
at
el
paso
that
it
was
your
most
valued
possession
fancy
your
remembering
i
said
i
remember
lots
of
things
concerning
you
he
answered
as
he
guided
me
into
the
big
dignified
building
whose
lights
were
lowered
like
most
of
london
illuminations
in
these
times
wish
the
bangle
on
for
me
i
said
hastily
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
which
we
were
to
ascend
rather
than
expose
my
uncovered
shoulders
to
the
scandalized
eyes
of
the
man
in
the
lift
would
dalziel
approve
he
asked
smiling
as
i
thrust
the
bangle
into
his
hand
you
showed
it
to
me
in
texas
as
a
present
from
tony
you
remember
that
too
this
is
the
one
thing
i
kept
to
remind
me
of
poor
tony
poor
tony
indeed
if
you
sent
him
about
his
business
eagle
slipped
the
bangle
over
my
hand
looking
straight
at
me
as
though
wondering
not
only
why
i
had
come
but
why
i
was
so
pale
and
strange
wish
that
my
errand
here
may
end
in
the
greatest
and
most
glorious
success
i
prompted
him
he
held
my
wrist
for
a
second
or
two
wishing
silently
then
he
dropped
it
rather
abruptly
and
we
went
upstairs
to
the
first
floor
where
were
the
chambers
lent
to
eagle
by
his
friend
i
felt
somehow
that
by
asking
him
for
such
a
wish
i
had
impressed
him
with
the
real
importance
of
my
night
visit
he
unlocked
the
door
of
the
flat
with
a
and
almost
pushed
me
in
as
if
fearing
that
i
might
be
seen
and
perhaps
recognized
by
some
passing
occupant
of
the
house
switching
on
the
electricity
the
vestibule
was
lit
by
a
light
cheerfully
welcoming
off
it
opened
two
or
three
rooms
and
eagle
ushered
me
into
a
large
study
lined
with
bookshelves
and
having
long
windows
which
when
uncurtained
would
look
out
on
the
embankment
now
they
were
draped
with
crimson
velvet
the
sort
of
hangings
that
normal
men
with
no
female
belongings
invariably
choose
by
the
door
stood
a
tall
folding
screen
covered
with
red
satin
and
oriental
embroidery
there
were
bronzes
and
a
few
marble
busts
on
top
of
the
low
bookshelves
on
the
oak
panelling
here
and
there
hung
a
huge
chinese
plate
here
and
there
a
sporting
picture
with
one
glance
i
took
in
the
whole
interior
and
saw
that
it
was
thoroughly
masculine
in
a
large
fireplace
some
logs
of
wood
evidently
not
long
ago
ignited
were
crackling
suddenly
aware
that
i
was
very
cold
i
walked
across
the
room
and
shivering
held
out
my
hands
to
the
blaze
but
i
still
kept
the
khaki
coat
hanging
over
my
arm
poor
child
you
look
frozen
said
eagle
why
did
you
put
on
your
coat
i
laughed
a
nervous
excited
laugh
coat
i
echoed
look
at
it
so
saying
i
stretched
out
my
arm
to
display
the
garment
and
eagle
saw
what
it
was
khaki
uniform
he
exclaimed
from
the
a
by
jove
is
it
tony
dalziel
indeed
it
is
not
i
returned
i
here
to
tell
you
about
it
oh
eagle
what
i
have
done
if
you
had
come
home
you
ought
to
be
here
dear
peggy
he
said
and
i
not
sure
that
i
ought
to
have
brought
you
in
but
i
got
into
the
habit
of
trusting
you
when
you
tell
me
that
a
thing
important
it
important
i
cut
him
short
so
important
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
your
wits
are
too
quick
for
you
to
be
in
doubt
long
eagle
flattered
me
smiling
and
you
must
begin
at
once
dear
child
because
for
the
sake
of
all
the
conventionalities
i
ca
let
you
make
me
a
long
call
good
as
it
is
to
see
you
here
we
are
alone
in
the
place
now
so
all
right
for
the
moment
the
servant
my
friend
jim
white
lends
me
with
the
rooms
does
stay
at
night
he
lights
the
fire
and
puts
everything
shipshape
and
then
leaves
me
in
peace
till
morning
but
jim
himself
who
is
doing
interpreter
work
in
france
has
run
back
for
the
day
on
business
he
is
with
some
war
office
chaps
for
the
evening
but
any
time
after
twelve
i
expect
him
back
to
stay
the
night
you
must
be
gone
before
then
so
you
see
we
have
twenty
minutes
at
most
rome
was
saved
in
minute
i
always
heard
i
said
eagle
this
coat
was
sidney
vandyke
it
mine
now
because
diana
gave
it
to
me
with
a
lot
of
other
things
they
cared
nothing
about
for
our
belgian
men
they
did
know
god
was
delivering
them
into
my
hands
and
your
hands
for
i
give
this
to
you
to
do
with
as
you
will
it
is
the
coat
major
vandyke
wore
the
night
at
el
paso
when
he
was
in
temporary
command
he
wore
it
when
his
orderly
johnson
brought
him
the
message
you
wrote
on
a
leaf
out
of
your
notebook
the
message
he
swore
never
reached
him
as
i
spoke
i
held
out
the
coat
in
both
hands
with
the
inside
toward
eagle
so
that
he
could
see
for
himself
the
hole
i
had
made
in
the
lining
and
perhaps
draw
his
own
conclusions
i
saw
his
eyes
fix
themselves
on
the
long
slit
and
the
colour
rush
up
to
his
forehead
who
tore
that
slit
in
the
lining
he
asked
sharply
i
tore
it
peggy
you
found
something
yes
it
had
slipped
through
a
ripped
place
down
between
the
cloth
and
the
lining
good
god
message
the
message
here
it
is
and
from
the
bosom
of
my
low
dress
i
pulled
the
folded
bit
of
paper
warm
from
my
heart
he
took
it
from
me
our
fingers
touched
and
his
were
cold
as
ice
i
stood
still
while
he
opened
the
paper
and
read
the
words
which
were
of
as
great
importance
in
his
life
now
as
when
he
wrote
them
they
had
power
to
make
all
the
difference
to
him
and
to
another
man
between
honour
and
dishonour
for
a
long
minute
he
was
silent
and
motionless
reading
or
thinking
then
he
looked
up
abruptly
and
his
eyes
blazed
into
mine
peggy
he
said
in
a
level
monotonous
tone
which
i
knew
hid
deep
feeling
do
you
realize
what
this
means
to
me
yes
i
answered
i
realize
fully
i
dreamed
of
a
moment
like
this
for
you
i
lived
for
it
for
weeks
and
months
that
seem
like
years
and
that
it
should
come
to
me
from
you
i
hoped
i
prayed
tell
me
what
happened
i
told
him
only
leaving
out
the
part
about
diana
how
she
had
come
home
and
guessed
the
secret
i
had
found
and
tried
to
rob
me
to
mention
that
i
thought
might
seem
as
if
i
were
trying
to
boast
of
what
i
had
done
then
when
i
had
explained
how
i
dashed
out
of
the
house
leaving
everything
but
the
coat
which
would
be
invaluable
as
proof
i
hurried
on
lest
he
should
ask
questions
i
did
wish
to
answer
what
has
become
of
the
notebook
i
wanted
to
know
i
hope
you
got
it
better
than
that
eagle
said
if
i
had
it
in
my
possession
all
this
time
i
might
have
written
this
message
whenever
i
chose
torn
out
the
leaf
and
pretended
that
it
had
been
done
on
the
night
of
the
gunfiring
luckily
dell
the
friend
who
defended
me
in
my
trial
kept
the
book
it
was
produced
at
the
in
my
defence
and
the
torn
edge
shown
with
the
marks
on
the
next
page
made
by
pressing
down
heavily
with
a
blunt
pencil
vague
traces
of
words
could
be
seen
but
even
with
a
magnifying
glass
they
could
be
read
there
was
no
evidence
that
amounted
to
anything
but
my
friend
kept
the
book
he
said
it
might
be
of
use
some
day
i
had
no
such
hope
but
now
my
god
peggy
with
that
coat
and
your
story
the
case
against
vandyke
seems
to
me
complete
how
thankful
i
am
to
hear
you
say
that
i
almost
sobbed
moved
by
his
excitement
to
greater
excitement
of
my
own
i
felt
it
must
be
so
but
i
only
a
girl
i
did
i
could
be
sure
oh
eagle
never
understand
what
it
is
to
me
to
think
i
been
able
to
help
you
even
a
little
if
it
had
been
for
me
the
dreadful
thing
would
never
have
happened
you
still
be
just
what
you
were
before
we
met
you
not
helped
me
a
you
given
me
new
life
he
said
some
time
i
tell
you
maybe
why
i
rather
have
the
gift
from
you
than
any
one
else
but
i
ca
understand
what
you
mean
by
saying
thing
would
never
have
happened
if
it
had
been
for
you
if
i
had
wanted
a
new
dress
and
if
i
had
gone
to
wardour
street
to
sell
my
lace
and
make
money
to
buy
the
frock
we
should
never
have
known
each
other
you
would
have
seen
diana
we
should
have
gone
to
america
and
if
we
had
gone
to
america
and
met
major
vandyke
those
guns
would
never
have
been
fired
and
heaps
of
official
bother
would
have
been
saved
but
far
the
best
of
all
would
have
been
as
happy
as
ever
you
might
as
well
blame
yourself
for
being
born
said
eagle
and
on
my
soul
i
tell
you
peggy
that
even
without
the
new
hope
you
given
me
i
would
go
back
if
i
could
choose
and
be
without
my
experience
in
belgium
or
or
without
in
my
life
he
held
out
his
hands
for
mine
and
i
gave
them
to
a
grasp
that
hurt
something
he
was
about
to
say
but
before
he
had
time
to
speak
there
came
a
long
shrill
peal
of
the
electric
bell
eagle
dropped
my
hands
instantly
by
jove
it
must
be
jim
forgotten
his
key
i
do
want
him
to
see
you
peggy
he
a
very
good
fellow
but
a
tells
everything
he
knows
run
behind
that
red
screen
and
when
i
got
him
into
his
own
room
which
i
do
somehow
in
a
few
minutes
i
take
you
to
a
taxi
and
drive
home
with
you
if
it
can
be
managed
i
whisked
behind
the
screen
peeping
out
to
whisper
better
hide
the
khaki
coat
if
you
do
want
questions
eagle
took
my
advice
handing
me
the
coat
to
keep
for
him
as
he
passed
on
his
way
to
the
door
there
was
plenty
of
room
to
stand
behind
the
screen
without
flattening
myself
against
the
wall
and
without
danger
of
being
seen
i
could
look
through
the
interstices
between
the
leaves
of
the
screen
into
the
brightly
lighted
room
i
heard
eagle
footsteps
on
the
parquet
floor
of
the
vestibule
i
heard
the
click
of
the
latch
as
he
opened
the
door
after
that
instead
of
a
loud
jolly
greeting
from
his
friend
there
was
dead
silence
for
an
instant
then
a
woman
voice
spoke
in
a
low
tone
of
intense
and
passionate
eagerness
i
had
never
heard
it
speak
in
that
tone
before
but
with
a
shock
of
surprise
and
fear
i
recognized
the
voice
it
was
diana
chapter
xxv
my
heart
stood
still
thinking
calmly
it
seemed
that
diana
had
no
power
to
harm
eagle
march
i
had
the
coat
which
betrayed
sidney
eagle
had
the
written
message
and
his
friend
in
america
had
the
notebook
out
of
which
it
had
been
torn
the
chain
of
our
evidence
was
complete
it
could
not
be
broken
eagle
had
long
ago
seen
through
diana
and
ceased
to
worship
her
surely
she
could
do
nothing
with
him
now
no
matter
how
shamefully
she
might
humble
herself
but
i
could
not
think
calmly
and
as
i
heard
her
sweet
imploring
voice
begging
to
come
in
as
i
realized
that
eagle
could
not
shut
her
out
a
heavy
presentiment
of
failure
weighed
upon
me
i
braced
myself
to
be
ready
for
anything
that
might
happen
ready
to
spring
from
behind
the
screen
and
confront
diana
if
need
came
if
you
ever
cared
for
me
if
you
have
any
pity
for
an
unhappy
woman
let
me
in
let
me
speak
to
you
were
the
words
i
heard
her
say
in
a
voice
like
the
wail
of
its
pathos
would
have
been
irresistible
to
any
man
even
if
he
had
never
loved
her
eagle
march
let
diana
come
in
though
i
heard
him
protesting
that
his
friend
jim
white
might
arrive
at
any
moment
what
does
it
matter
she
cried
and
with
the
words
she
was
at
the
study
door
through
the
leaves
of
the
tall
screen
i
saw
her
trail
in
a
figure
of
beauty
in
her
white
satin
dress
and
sombre
purple
cloak
her
dark
hair
wreathed
with
a
fillet
of
emerald
laurel
leaves
that
gave
her
face
the
look
of
some
tragic
muse
of
long
ago
i
know
jim
white
she
hurried
on
and
he
knows
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
i
here
for
nothing
wrong
i
not
afraid
of
him
it
you
i
afraid
of
eagle
she
stopped
and
faced
him
unknowingly
she
faced
me
too
eagle
back
was
turned
toward
me
but
i
could
see
diana
blue
eyes
gazing
up
at
him
they
were
sad
and
beautiful
beyond
words
with
a
shiver
of
fear
i
realized
that
no
woman
on
earth
could
be
lovelier
than
my
sister
all
womanhood
with
its
appeal
to
man
was
in
her
great
imploring
eyes
i
was
glad
that
eagle
did
not
answer
i
hoped
his
silence
might
mean
that
her
beauty
had
lost
its
magic
for
him
that
he
understood
fully
how
she
had
come
to
beguile
him
and
that
he
meant
to
give
her
no
opening
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
you
since
since
that
night
at
alvarado
when
you
bade
me
she
went
on
letting
her
voice
break
into
a
sob
you
saw
me
at
the
embassy
he
answered
so
coldly
that
in
her
place
i
should
have
been
chilled
with
discouragement
i
dared
not
look
at
you
there
she
confessed
i
was
afraid
of
myself
oh
eagle
i
even
more
afraid
of
you
now
more
afraid
than
of
myself
really
i
am
not
so
very
formidable
lady
diana
said
eagle
with
cool
scorn
that
showed
in
tone
and
manner
but
if
i
may
ask
since
you
stand
in
such
dread
of
me
why
do
you
come
to
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
because
the
lion
is
brave
and
kingly
i
have
ventured
i
to
come
eagle
there
was
no
other
way
i
found
out
your
address
from
your
russian
friend
major
skobeleff
he
happened
to
mention
it
asking
me
if
i
knew
jim
white
who
lent
the
place
to
you
i
did
guess
then
how
thankful
i
soon
be
to
know
where
you
lived
oh
eagle
do
look
at
me
so
cruelly
i
ca
bear
it
you
hate
me
but
you
must
judge
if
you
knew
everything
you
see
that
you
done
me
a
wrong
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
said
eagle
as
formally
as
if
he
spoke
to
a
stranger
and
you
are
mistaken
if
you
really
suppose
i
hate
you
i
have
gone
through
a
good
deal
lately
lady
diana
and
learned
to
see
personal
things
in
the
right
proportion
let
me
assure
you
my
feelings
toward
you
are
not
in
the
least
malevolent
you
mean
you
do
care
for
me
any
more
i
ought
to
be
glad
for
your
sake
and
mine
too
but
i
love
you
eagle
i
truly
did
only
i
was
a
coward
i
was
deceived
as
other
people
were
deceived
and
i
had
father
to
think
of
as
well
as
myself
do
excuse
yourself
to
me
i
beg
all
that
is
past
and
done
with
you
did
come
here
i
sure
to
ah
if
the
past
could
be
done
with
it
ca
and
that
is
why
i
have
come
i
know
peggy
has
been
with
you
it
useless
to
tell
me
she
has
not
i
no
intention
of
telling
you
a
lie
lady
diana
di
broke
down
and
cried
without
any
effort
to
restrain
herself
she
did
not
look
quite
her
beautiful
self
when
she
cried
but
she
looked
a
hundred
times
more
pathetic
you
wo
believe
me
i
suppose
she
sobbed
but
till
i
never
knew
knew
that
sidney
had
deceived
me
i
believed
what
he
told
me
to
believe
it
is
an
awful
blow
i
think
my
heart
is
broken
but
oh
god
eagle
if
you
ruin
him
before
the
world
it
will
be
my
death
to
my
astonishment
eagle
answered
with
a
laugh
a
laugh
of
exceeding
bitterness
you
seem
to
believe
and
disbelieve
easily
lady
diana
vandyke
he
said
once
you
believed
in
me
then
you
ceased
to
believe
in
me
and
threw
me
over
because
another
man
a
richer
man
than
i
told
you
and
everybody
else
that
i
was
a
liar
you
believed
in
him
instead
on
his
mere
word
you
married
him
may
i
ask
if
he
has
confessed
to
you
or
do
you
take
his
guilt
for
granted
as
you
took
mine
on
circumstantial
evidence
no
he
has
not
confessed
anything
di
answered
yet
there
was
something
in
her
tone
and
confused
anxious
manner
that
made
me
sure
she
was
not
telling
the
truth
the
conviction
swept
over
me
that
something
had
happened
at
the
house
in
park
lane
since
i
slammed
the
front
door
and
ran
out
diana
might
have
thought
twice
before
coming
to
grovel
here
to
eagle
unless
she
had
been
sure
that
i
was
not
jumping
to
conclusions
sure
that
there
could
be
no
possible
mistake
about
i
had
found
in
sidney
suddenly
i
knew
as
well
as
if
she
had
put
the
story
into
words
that
sidney
had
come
home
before
she
had
made
up
her
mind
what
to
do
that
she
had
told
him
about
the
coat
and
that
i
had
carried
it
off
to
eagle
march
that
sidney
knowing
well
what
my
discovery
must
have
been
had
broken
down
and
sent
diana
to
eagle
in
the
one
last
hope
that
her
pleading
might
save
him
from
his
revenge
i
have
seen
sidney
she
hurried
on
but
instinct
tells
me
some
things
i
afraid
i
know
that
his
loving
me
so
much
made
him
cruel
to
you
oh
do
look
at
me
like
that
you
turn
me
to
ice
true
is
a
hard
enough
word
for
what
he
did
i
do
try
to
excuse
him
but
he
sinned
for
my
sake
that
softens
my
heart
toward
him
i
human
i
not
inhuman
i
trust
said
eagle
but
it
does
soften
heart
toward
him
i
do
ask
that
diana
wept
all
i
ask
is
your
forgiveness
for
me
that
you
soften
your
heart
for
me
i
forgive
you
freely
lady
diana
eagle
answered
for
any
injury
you
may
have
done
me
in
the
past
for
i
have
lived
it
down
the
injury
vandyke
did
me
i
thought
till
i
could
never
live
down
but
thanks
to
the
most
loyal
friend
a
man
ever
had
i
been
given
my
chance
diana
flung
up
her
head
and
there
were
no
tears
in
her
eyes
peggy
a
loyal
friend
she
cried
she
a
traitor
to
father
and
me
when
she
betrays
sidney
what
right
has
she
to
be
loyal
to
you
at
our
expense
and
it
is
loyalty
not
what
mean
by
loyalty
she
has
always
hated
sidney
for
your
sake
and
now
she
can
calmly
see
him
ruined
not
because
of
any
wish
for
justice
but
simply
because
she
desperately
idiotically
in
love
with
you
because
she
do
anything
no
matter
how
cruel
to
others
in
the
hope
of
winning
you
for
herself
now
you
know
the
real
truth
about
peggy
i
wish
i
could
think
it
were
the
real
truth
said
eagle
very
quietly
and
very
slowly
to
have
peggy
love
would
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
i
realized
that
for
some
time
now
while
i
was
under
arrest
before
my
and
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
that
was
the
time
it
was
borne
in
on
me
lady
diana
just
how
much
difference
there
is
between
you
and
peggy
diana
stood
speechless
staring
at
him
i
was
afraid
the
two
out
there
might
hear
my
heartbeats
they
sounded
so
loudly
in
my
own
ears
i
realized
how
foolish
i
been
not
to
see
that
difference
before
eagle
went
on
still
speaking
with
a
deliberate
distinctness
as
if
he
were
willing
i
should
catch
every
word
that
he
should
be
saying
such
things
to
diana
was
so
wonderful
so
almost
incredible
that
i
asked
myself
if
he
were
saying
them
only
to
save
my
pride
because
di
had
snatched
my
love
for
him
out
of
hiding
and
trailed
it
in
the
dust
at
his
feet
i
ought
to
have
loved
peggy
almost
as
much
as
i
love
her
now
the
very
day
we
met
first
i
ought
to
have
felt
she
was
the
woman
the
one
thing
in
the
world
for
me
but
she
looked
such
a
child
it
would
have
seemed
like
sacrilege
to
love
her
as
a
man
loves
a
woman
that
little
sprite
of
a
creature
and
then
i
met
you
you
dazzled
me
lady
diana
that
the
word
for
it
i
think
no
other
would
fit
but
i
did
know
i
was
dazzled
till
you
took
the
light
away
as
soon
as
the
bright
spots
faded
from
before
my
eyes
as
bright
spots
do
at
last
when
you
been
staring
at
the
sun
i
saw
things
as
they
really
were
i
saw
what
my
feeling
for
you
was
worth
and
what
my
feeling
for
peggy
might
grow
to
be
but
i
tried
not
to
let
it
grow
i
suffered
enough
i
was
down
and
out
and
if
i
was
worthy
of
you
still
less
was
i
worthy
of
peggy
besides
i
thought
she
was
engaged
to
dalziel
and
i
wanted
to
be
glad
for
her
he
a
good
fellow
then
we
were
thrown
together
in
belgium
she
and
i
and
if
i
loved
her
before
i
should
have
begun
to
love
her
then
as
a
man
loves
just
one
girl
in
his
life
whatever
i
have
done
since
the
few
small
things
i
have
been
able
to
do
have
all
been
with
the
thought
of
her
in
my
heart
as
a
lodestar
so
now
you
will
understand
lady
diana
how
little
impression
you
can
make
upon
me
by
calling
your
sister
a
traitor
you
say
all
this
to
hurt
me
diana
cried
out
but
you
did
care
for
me
once
eagle
do
not
forget
that
i
forget
nothing
he
said
but
the
time
you
speak
of
seems
a
long
time
ago
i
care
so
much
more
for
peggy
now
just
how
much
i
care
for
her
i
am
going
to
prove
to
you
in
a
moment
for
a
second
he
paused
while
di
waited
not
knowing
what
to
say
and
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
waiting
too
my
heart
and
breath
stopped
for
his
next
words
if
i
had
ever
loved
you
as
dearly
as
i
once
thought
i
did
he
went
on
sadness
in
his
voice
i
suppose
i
could
have
refused
you
nothing
when
you
came
to
me
but
i
do
defend
myself
i
only
confess
to
the
hardness
in
me
you
have
moved
me
at
all
you
were
cruel
as
the
grave
to
me
i
could
be
cruel
in
return
to
you
that
is
i
could
act
as
i
thought
right
and
be
indifferent
to
the
effect
on
you
your
husband
did
his
best
to
ruin
me
virtually
he
did
ruin
me
even
he
has
lied
again
the
same
old
lie
to
pull
me
down
if
he
could
from
the
miserable
little
height
i
crawled
up
to
like
a
singed
moth
creeping
out
of
the
flame
did
you
ever
believe
in
his
truth
and
my
guilt
believe
in
the
depths
of
your
soul
if
you
have
a
soul
i
doubt
it
anyhow
you
helped
his
lies
as
often
before
of
that
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
i
no
mercy
for
you
in
my
heart
and
none
for
vandyke
i
had
none
even
when
i
stopped
the
horses
on
your
wedding
day
i
did
do
that
from
any
softening
of
heart
toward
either
of
you
it
was
purely
mechanical
i
have
done
the
same
for
a
pair
of
thieves
i
assure
you
nothing
you
could
say
to
me
for
yourself
lady
diana
would
make
me
give
up
my
revenge
or
rather
my
justification
which
by
his
own
fault
ca
come
to
me
without
vandyke
ruin
but
something
you
have
said
about
peggy
has
made
all
the
difference
about
peggy
what
do
you
mean
di
faltered
you
said
that
she
was
a
to
her
people
for
my
sake
now
because
i
love
her
i
ca
let
her
be
that
i
wo
profit
by
her
loyalty
to
me
at
your
expense
and
i
wo
have
the
world
say
in
speaking
of
her
lady
peggy
who
bore
witness
against
her
and
ruined
him
for
myself
i
believe
it
give
me
a
qualm
if
vandyke
blew
out
his
brains
but
you
have
made
me
realize
that
i
could
bear
it
for
sake
thank
you
for
that
lady
diana
here
is
the
paper
which
peggy
found
inside
the
lining
of
your
husband
coat
and
brought
to
me
because
of
peggy
and
my
love
for
her
take
it
and
do
with
it
as
you
choose
diana
gave
a
little
joyous
shriek
but
my
cry
of
despair
mingled
with
it
i
pushed
back
the
screen
so
that
it
tottered
and
fell
with
a
crash
as
i
flew
out
in
time
to
seize
eagle
hand
with
the
paper
in
it
no
i
gasped
do
let
me
have
lived
for
nothing
eagle
i
would
gladly
have
given
my
life
to
get
this
bit
of
paper
for
you
i
shall
die
of
grief
if
i
not
to
help
you
after
all
holding
the
written
message
firmly
in
one
hand
he
laid
the
other
over
mine
you
heard
all
i
said
he
asked
i
am
glad
i
meant
you
to
hear
it
in
your
sister
presence
yet
though
you
heard
you
speak
of
not
me
peggy
what
she
said
is
true
then
it
is
true
that
you
love
me
it
is
true
and
you
know
it
only
too
well
i
answered
hardly
remembering
that
diana
listened
hanging
anxiously
on
every
word
as
on
a
verdict
for
life
or
death
i
worship
you
eagle
and
that
why
i
care
to
live
if
you
are
not
saved
the
great
chance
has
come
when
we
least
expected
it
and
if
you
do
take
it
now
it
in
your
hand
it
seems
to
me
that
my
way
of
taking
the
great
chance
is
after
all
the
only
way
if
we
are
to
be
happy
peggy
i
find
that
i
love
you
too
much
to
take
any
other
way
can
you
love
me
as
i
am
love
me
enough
to
say
what
is
right
for
you
it
is
right
for
you
to
have
justice
i
pleaded
with
him
i
would
rather
have
love
you
can
have
both
no
it
does
seem
so
to
me
oh
you
are
obstinate
obstinate
perhaps
i
afraid
i
always
was
but
i
love
you
i
suffered
and
now
i
want
to
be
happy
and
at
peace
it
is
only
for
your
sake
for
mine
as
well
great
love
is
worthy
of
the
only
great
revenge
shall
i
burn
the
paper
for
god
sake
say
yes
peggy
i
heard
diana
sob
but
i
hardly
listened
if
she
said
more
i
did
not
hear
it
i
was
looking
at
eagle
does
silence
give
consent
he
asked
there
was
a
new
light
in
his
eyes
brighter
and
clearer
than
the
careless
light
of
youth
that
was
lost
i
could
not
quench
it
so
i
bowed
my
head
and
let
the
khaki
coat
which
half
unconsciously
i
had
been
holding
all
the
time
drop
to
the
floor
the
glory
of
eagle
smile
repaid
me
he
took
my
hand
in
his
and
leading
me
walked
to
the
fireplace
there
he
stooped
and
without
hesitation
dropped
the
paper
which
might
have
changed
his
whole
life
into
the
flames
to
the
past
he
cried
hail
to
the
future
peggy
such
as
it
is
such
as
it
can
be
for
me
now
will
you
share
it
you
know
i
whispered
he
pressed
my
hand
tightly
then
turned
to
diana
you
had
better
go
home
to
your
husband
he
said
you
can
sleep
in
peace
and
all
nights
presently
i
shall
take
peggy
to
hampstead
but
i
want
her
to
myself
for
a
moment
first
without
a
word
to
either
of
us
diana
obeyed
her
head
bent
low
i
suppose
she
could
find
nothing
to
say
since
thank
you
would
be
commonplace
and
di
is
never
commonplace
i
heard
eagle
open
the
door
for
her
and
shut
it
behind
the
trailing
white
satin
and
purple
brocade
then
he
came
back
to
me
and
held
out
his
arms
i
had
been
in
the
sky
with
him
before
but
this
was
heaven
he
is
at
the
front
now
and
has
been
for
a
long
time
but
whatever
may
happen
neither
life
nor
death
can
part
our
souls
the
sacrifice
he
made
was
for
my
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
love
so
you
see
why
changing
only
our
names
i
have
written
this
bit
of
secret
history
and
told
the
truth
about
eagle
march
and
monsieur
mars
the
end
