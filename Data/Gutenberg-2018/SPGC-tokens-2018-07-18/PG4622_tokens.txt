chapter
i
my
speculation
in
china
ware
this
happened
a
very
few
years
after
my
marriage
and
is
one
of
those
feeling
incidents
in
life
that
we
never
forget
my
income
was
moderate
and
we
found
it
necessary
to
deny
ourselves
many
little
articles
of
ornament
and
luxury
to
the
end
that
there
might
be
no
serious
abatement
in
the
comforts
of
life
in
furnishing
our
house
we
had
been
obliged
to
content
ourselves
mainly
with
things
useful
our
parlor
could
boast
of
nine
chairs
one
rocking
chair
a
pair
of
card
tables
a
pair
of
ottomans
the
covers
for
which
i
had
worked
in
worsted
and
a
few
illustrated
books
upon
the
card
tables
there
were
no
pictures
on
the
walls
nor
ornaments
on
the
mantle
pieces
for
a
time
after
my
marriage
with
smith
i
did
not
think
much
about
the
plainness
of
our
style
of
living
but
after
a
while
contracts
between
my
own
parlors
and
those
of
one
or
two
friends
would
take
place
in
my
mind
and
i
often
found
myself
wishing
that
we
could
afford
a
set
of
candelabras
a
pair
of
china
vases
or
some
choice
pieces
of
bohemian
glass
in
fact
i
set
my
heart
on
something
of
the
kind
though
i
concealed
the
weakness
from
my
husband
time
stole
on
and
one
increase
after
another
to
our
family
kept
up
the
necessity
for
careful
expenditure
and
at
no
time
was
there
money
enough
in
the
purse
to
justify
any
outlay
beyond
what
the
wants
of
the
household
required
so
my
mantel
pieces
remained
bare
as
at
first
notwithstanding
the
desire
for
something
to
put
on
them
still
remained
active
one
afternoon
as
i
sat
at
work
renovating
an
old
garment
with
the
hope
of
making
it
look
almost
as
good
as
new
my
cook
entered
and
said
there
a
man
down
stairs
smith
with
a
basket
full
of
the
most
beautiful
glass
dishes
and
china
ornaments
that
you
ever
did
see
and
he
says
that
he
will
sell
them
for
old
clothes
for
old
clothes
i
responded
but
half
comprehending
what
the
girl
meant
yes
if
you
have
got
an
old
coat
or
a
pair
of
pantaloons
that
ai
good
for
nothing
he
will
buy
them
and
pay
you
in
glass
or
china
i
paused
for
a
moment
to
think
and
then
said
tell
him
to
come
up
into
the
dining
room
mary
the
girl
went
down
stairs
and
soon
came
back
in
company
with
a
dull
looking
old
man
who
carried
on
his
arm
a
large
basket
in
which
were
temptingly
displayed
rich
china
vases
motto
and
presentation
cups
and
saucers
glass
dishes
and
sundry
other
articles
of
a
like
character
any
old
coats
pantaloons
or
vests
said
the
man
as
he
placed
carefully
his
basket
on
the
floor
do
want
any
money
see
here
beautiful
and
as
he
spoke
he
took
up
a
pair
of
vases
and
held
them
before
my
eyes
they
were
just
the
thing
for
my
mantle
pieces
and
i
covetted
them
on
the
instant
what
the
price
i
enquired
got
an
old
coat
was
my
only
answer
do
want
money
my
husband
was
the
possessor
of
a
coat
that
had
seen
pretty
good
service
and
which
he
had
not
worn
for
some
time
in
fact
it
had
been
voted
superannuated
and
consigned
to
a
dark
corner
of
the
the
thought
of
this
garment
came
very
naturally
into
my
mind
and
with
the
thought
a
pleasant
exhilaration
of
feeling
for
i
already
saw
the
vases
on
my
mantles
any
old
clothes
repeated
the
vender
of
china
ware
without
a
word
i
left
the
dining
room
and
hurried
up
to
where
our
large
stood
in
the
passage
above
from
this
i
soon
abstracted
the
coat
and
then
descended
with
quick
steps
the
dull
face
of
the
old
man
brightened
the
moment
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
garment
he
seized
it
with
a
nervous
movement
and
seemed
to
take
in
its
condition
at
a
single
glance
apparently
the
examination
was
not
very
satisfactory
for
he
let
the
coat
fall
in
a
careless
manner
across
a
chair
giving
his
shoulders
a
shrug
while
a
slight
expression
of
contempt
flitted
over
his
countenance
not
much
good
fell
from
his
lips
after
a
pause
by
this
time
i
had
turned
to
his
basket
and
was
examining
more
carefully
its
contents
most
prominent
stood
the
china
vases
upon
which
my
heart
was
already
set
and
instinctively
i
took
them
in
my
hands
what
will
you
give
for
the
coat
said
i
the
old
man
gave
his
head
a
significant
shake
as
he
replied
no
very
good
it
worth
something
i
returned
many
a
poor
person
would
be
glad
to
buy
it
for
a
small
sum
of
money
it
only
a
little
defaced
i
sure
its
richly
worth
four
or
five
dollars
pho
pho
five
dollar
pho
the
old
man
seemed
angry
at
my
most
unreasonable
assumption
well
well
said
i
beginning
to
feel
a
little
impatient
just
tell
me
what
you
will
give
for
it
what
you
want
he
enquired
his
manner
visibly
changing
i
want
these
vases
at
any
rate
i
answered
holding
up
the
articles
i
had
mentioned
worth
four
five
dollar
ejaculated
the
dealer
in
well
feigned
surprise
i
shook
my
head
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
commenced
searching
his
basket
from
which
after
a
while
he
took
a
china
cup
and
saucer
on
which
i
read
in
gilt
letters
for
my
husband
give
you
this
said
he
it
was
now
my
time
to
show
surprise
i
answered
indeed
you
wo
then
but
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
let
you
have
the
coat
for
the
vases
and
this
cup
and
saucer
to
this
proposition
the
man
gave
an
instant
and
decided
negative
and
seemed
half
offended
by
my
offer
he
threw
the
coat
which
was
in
his
hands
again
upon
a
chair
and
stooping
down
took
his
basket
on
his
arm
i
was
deceived
by
his
manner
and
began
to
think
that
i
had
proposed
rather
a
hard
bargain
so
i
said
you
can
have
the
coat
for
the
vases
if
you
care
to
make
the
exchange
if
not
why
no
harm
is
done
for
the
space
of
nearly
half
a
minute
the
old
man
stood
in
apparent
irresolution
then
he
replied
as
he
set
down
his
basket
and
took
out
the
pair
of
vases
i
do
care
you
shall
have
them
i
took
the
vases
and
he
took
the
coat
a
moment
or
two
more
and
i
heard
the
street
door
close
behind
the
dealer
in
china
ware
with
a
very
decided
jar
ai
they
beautiful
aunty
said
i
to
my
old
aunt
rachel
who
had
been
a
silent
witness
of
the
scene
i
have
just
described
and
i
held
the
pair
of
vases
before
her
eyes
why
yes
they
are
rather
pretty
jane
replied
aunt
rachel
a
little
coldly
as
i
thought
rather
pretty
they
are
beautiful
said
i
warmly
see
there
and
i
placed
them
on
the
dining
room
mantle
how
much
they
will
improve
our
parlors
not
half
so
much
as
that
old
coat
you
as
good
as
gave
away
would
have
improved
the
feelings
as
well
as
the
looks
of
poor
bryan
who
lives
across
the
street
was
the
unexpected
and
rebuking
answer
of
aunt
rachel
the
words
smote
on
my
feelings
bryan
was
a
poor
but
honest
and
industrious
young
man
upon
whose
daily
labor
a
wife
and
five
children
were
dependent
he
went
meanly
clad
because
he
could
not
earn
enough
in
addition
to
what
his
family
required
to
buy
comfortable
clothing
for
himself
i
saw
in
an
instant
what
the
true
disposition
of
the
coat
should
have
been
the
china
vases
would
a
little
improve
the
appearance
of
my
parlors
but
how
many
pleasant
feelings
and
hours
and
days
of
comfort
would
the
old
coat
have
given
to
bryan
i
said
no
more
aunt
rachel
went
on
with
her
knitting
and
i
took
the
vases
down
into
the
parlors
and
placed
them
on
the
mantles
one
in
each
room
but
they
looked
small
and
seemed
quite
solitary
so
i
put
one
on
each
end
of
a
single
mantle
this
did
better
still
i
was
disappointed
in
the
appearance
they
made
and
a
good
deal
displeased
with
myself
i
felt
that
i
had
made
a
bad
bargain
that
is
one
from
which
i
should
obtain
no
real
pleasure
for
a
while
i
sat
opposite
the
looking
at
the
vases
but
not
admiringly
then
i
left
the
parlor
and
went
about
my
household
duties
but
with
a
pressure
on
my
feelings
i
was
far
very
far
from
being
satisfied
with
myself
about
an
hour
afterwards
my
husband
came
home
i
did
not
take
him
into
the
parlor
to
show
him
my
little
purchase
for
i
had
no
heart
to
do
so
as
we
sat
at
the
tea
table
he
said
addressing
me
you
know
that
old
coat
of
mine
that
is
up
in
the
i
nodded
my
head
in
assent
but
did
not
venture
to
speak
i
been
thinking
added
my
husband
that
it
would
be
just
the
thing
for
bryan
who
lives
opposite
it
rather
too
much
worn
for
me
but
will
look
quite
decent
on
him
compared
with
the
clothes
he
now
wears
do
you
think
it
is
a
good
thought
we
will
of
course
make
him
a
present
of
the
garment
my
eyes
drooped
to
the
table
and
i
felt
the
blood
crimsoning
my
face
for
a
moment
or
two
i
remained
silent
and
then
answered
i
sorry
you
did
think
of
this
before
but
it
too
late
now
too
late
why
enquired
my
husband
i
sold
the
coat
this
afternoon
was
my
reply
sold
it
yes
a
man
came
along
with
some
handsome
china
ornaments
and
i
sold
the
coat
for
a
pair
of
vases
to
set
on
our
there
was
an
instant
change
in
my
husband
face
he
disapproved
of
what
i
had
done
and
though
he
uttered
no
condemning
words
his
countenance
gave
too
clear
an
index
to
his
feelings
the
coat
would
have
done
poor
bryan
a
great
deal
more
good
than
the
vases
will
ever
do
jane
spoke
up
aunt
rachel
with
less
regard
for
my
feelings
than
was
manifested
by
my
husband
i
do
think
she
continued
that
any
body
ought
to
sell
old
clothes
for
either
money
or
nicknackeries
to
put
on
the
let
them
be
given
to
the
poor
and
they
do
some
good
there
is
a
housekeeper
in
moderate
circumstances
that
could
almost
clothe
some
poor
family
by
giving
away
the
cast
off
garments
that
every
year
accumulate
on
her
hands
how
sharply
did
i
feel
the
rebuking
spirit
in
these
words
of
aunt
rachel
what
done
ca
be
helped
now
said
my
husband
kindly
interrupting
as
he
spoke
some
further
remarks
that
aunt
rachel
evidently
intended
to
make
we
must
do
better
next
time
i
must
do
better
was
my
quick
remark
made
in
penitent
tones
i
was
very
thoughtless
to
relieve
my
mind
my
husband
changed
the
subject
of
conversation
but
nothing
could
relieve
the
pressure
upon
my
feelings
caused
by
a
too
acute
consciousness
of
having
done
what
in
the
eyes
of
my
husband
looked
like
a
want
of
true
humanity
i
could
not
bear
that
he
should
think
me
void
of
sympathy
for
others
the
day
following
was
sunday
church
time
came
and
smith
went
to
the
clothes
press
for
his
best
coat
which
had
been
worn
only
for
a
few
months
jane
he
called
to
me
suddenly
in
a
voice
that
made
me
start
jane
where
is
my
best
coat
in
the
clothes
press
i
replied
coming
out
from
our
chamber
into
the
passage
as
i
spoke
no
it
not
here
was
his
reply
and
i
should
wonder
if
you
had
sold
my
good
coat
for
those
china
vases
no
such
thing
i
quickly
answered
though
my
heart
gave
a
great
bound
at
his
words
and
then
sunk
in
my
bosom
with
a
low
tremor
of
alarm
here
my
old
coat
said
smith
holding
up
that
defaced
garment
where
is
the
new
one
the
old
clothes
man
has
it
as
sure
as
i
live
burst
from
my
lips
well
that
is
a
nice
piece
of
work
i
must
confess
this
was
all
my
husband
said
but
it
was
enough
to
smite
me
almost
to
the
floor
covering
my
face
with
my
hands
i
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
and
sobbed
for
a
while
bitterly
it
ca
be
helped
now
jane
said
smith
at
length
in
a
soothing
voice
the
coat
is
gone
and
there
is
no
help
for
it
you
will
know
better
next
time
that
was
all
he
said
to
me
then
and
i
was
grateful
for
his
kind
consideration
he
saw
that
i
was
punished
quite
severely
enough
and
did
not
add
to
my
pain
by
rebuke
or
complaint
an
attempt
was
made
during
the
week
to
recover
the
coat
valued
at
some
twenty
dollars
but
the
china
was
not
to
be
found
he
had
made
too
good
a
bargain
to
run
the
risk
of
having
it
broken
about
an
hour
after
the
discovery
of
the
loss
of
my
husband
coat
i
went
quietly
down
into
the
parlor
and
taking
from
the
the
china
vases
worth
probably
a
dollar
for
the
pair
concealed
them
under
my
apron
lest
any
one
should
see
what
i
had
and
returning
up
stairs
hid
them
away
in
a
dark
closet
where
they
have
ever
since
remained
the
reader
may
be
sure
that
i
never
forgot
this
my
first
and
last
speculation
in
china
ware
chapter
ii
something
about
cooks
was
there
ever
a
good
cook
who
had
some
prominent
fault
that
completely
overshadowed
her
professional
good
qualities
if
my
experience
is
to
answer
the
question
the
reply
will
be
i
had
been
married
several
years
before
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
cook
that
could
be
trusted
to
boil
a
potato
or
broil
a
steak
i
felt
as
if
completely
made
up
when
margaret
served
her
first
dinner
the
roast
was
just
right
and
all
the
vegetables
were
cooked
and
flavored
as
well
as
if
i
had
done
it
myself
in
fact
a
little
better
my
husband
eat
with
a
relish
not
often
exhibited
and
praised
almost
every
thing
on
the
table
for
a
week
one
good
meal
followed
another
in
daily
succession
we
had
hot
cakes
light
and
every
morning
for
breakfast
with
coffee
not
to
be
beaten
and
chops
or
steaks
steaming
from
the
gridiron
that
would
have
gladdened
the
heart
of
an
epicure
dinner
was
served
during
the
time
with
a
punctuality
that
was
rarely
a
minute
at
fault
while
every
article
of
food
brought
upon
the
table
fairly
tempted
the
appetite
light
rolls
rice
cakes
or
sally
luns
made
without
suggestion
on
my
part
usually
met
us
at
tea
time
in
fact
the
very
delight
of
margaret
life
appeared
to
be
in
cooking
she
was
born
for
a
cook
moreover
strange
to
say
margaret
was
a
most
remarkable
thing
in
a
good
cook
and
more
remarkable
still
was
tidy
in
her
person
and
cleanly
in
her
work
she
is
a
treasure
said
i
to
my
husband
one
day
as
we
passed
from
the
after
having
partaken
of
one
of
her
excellent
dinners
she
too
good
replied
smith
too
good
to
last
there
must
be
some
bad
fault
about
her
good
cooks
always
have
bad
faults
and
i
am
looking
for
its
appearance
every
day
do
talk
so
smith
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
a
good
cook
should
not
be
as
faultless
as
any
one
else
even
while
i
said
this
certain
misgivings
intruded
themselves
my
husband
went
to
his
store
soon
after
about
three
margaret
presented
herself
all
dressed
to
go
out
and
said
that
she
was
going
to
see
her
sister
but
would
be
back
in
time
to
get
tea
she
came
back
as
she
promised
but
alas
for
my
good
cook
the
fault
appeared
she
was
so
much
intoxicated
that
in
attempting
to
lift
the
kettle
from
the
fire
she
let
it
fall
and
came
near
scalding
herself
dreadfully
oh
dear
i
shall
never
forget
the
sad
disappointment
of
that
hour
how
the
pleasant
images
of
good
dinners
and
comfortable
breakfasts
and
suppers
faded
from
my
vision
the
old
trouble
was
to
come
back
again
for
the
faultless
cook
had
manifested
a
fault
that
vitiated
for
us
all
her
good
qualities
on
the
next
day
i
told
margaret
that
we
must
part
but
she
begged
so
hard
to
be
kept
in
her
place
and
promised
good
behaviour
in
future
so
earnestly
that
i
was
prevailed
on
to
try
her
again
it
was
of
no
use
however
in
less
than
a
week
she
was
drunk
again
and
i
had
to
let
her
go
after
that
for
some
months
we
had
burnt
steaks
waxy
potatoes
and
dried
roast
beef
to
our
hearts
content
while
such
luxuries
as
muffins
hot
cakes
and
the
like
were
not
to
be
seen
on
our
uninviting
table
my
next
good
cook
had
such
a
violent
temper
that
i
was
actually
afraid
to
show
my
face
in
the
kitchen
i
bore
with
her
until
patience
was
no
longer
a
virtue
and
then
she
went
biddy
who
took
charge
of
my
kitchen
cabinet
a
year
or
so
afterwards
proved
herself
a
culinary
artist
of
no
ordinary
merit
but
alas
biddy
kept
a
room
and
so
many
strange
disappearances
of
bars
of
soap
bowls
of
sugar
prints
of
butter
took
place
that
i
was
forced
to
the
unwilling
conclusion
that
her
room
was
simply
a
store
room
for
the
surplussage
of
mine
some
pretty
strong
evidence
on
this
point
coming
to
my
mind
i
dismissed
biddy
who
was
particularly
forward
in
declaring
her
honesty
although
i
had
never
accused
her
of
being
wanting
in
that
inestimable
virtue
some
of
my
experiences
in
cooks
have
been
musing
enough
or
i
should
rather
say
are
musing
enough
to
about
they
were
rather
annoying
at
the
time
of
their
occurrence
one
of
these
experiences
i
will
relate
i
had
obtained
a
treasure
in
a
new
cook
who
was
not
only
good
tempered
and
cleanly
but
understood
her
business
reasonably
well
kitty
was
a
little
different
from
former
incumbents
of
her
office
in
this
that
she
took
an
interest
in
reading
and
generally
dipped
into
the
morning
paper
before
it
found
its
way
up
stairs
to
this
of
course
i
had
no
objection
but
was
rather
pleased
to
see
it
time
however
which
proves
all
things
showed
my
cook
to
be
rather
too
literary
in
her
inclinations
i
often
found
her
reading
when
it
was
but
reasonable
for
me
to
expect
that
she
would
be
working
and
overdone
or
burnt
dishes
occasionally
marked
the
degree
in
which
her
mind
was
absorbed
in
her
literary
pleasures
which
i
discovered
in
time
were
not
of
the
highest
books
as
the
mysteries
of
paris
furnishing
the
aliment
that
fed
her
imagination
jane
said
my
husband
to
me
one
morning
as
he
was
about
leaving
the
house
i
believe
i
must
invite
my
old
friend
green
to
dine
with
me
he
will
leave
the
city
and
i
may
not
have
the
pleasure
of
a
social
hour
with
him
again
for
years
besides
i
want
to
introduce
him
to
you
we
were
intimate
as
young
men
and
much
attached
to
each
other
i
would
like
you
to
know
him
invite
him
by
all
means
was
my
reply
i
will
send
home
a
turkey
from
market
said
smith
as
he
stood
holding
on
to
the
open
door
tell
kitty
to
cook
it
just
right
green
i
am
told
is
a
housekeeper
and
i
feel
like
showing
you
off
to
the
best
advantage
do
look
for
too
much
i
replied
smiling
lest
you
be
disappointed
smith
went
away
and
i
walked
back
to
the
kitchen
door
to
say
a
word
to
kitty
as
i
looked
in
the
sound
of
my
feet
on
the
floor
caused
her
to
start
she
was
standing
near
a
window
and
at
my
appearance
she
hurriedly
concealed
something
under
her
apron
kitty
said
i
we
are
to
have
company
to
dine
with
us
smith
will
send
home
a
turkey
which
you
must
dress
and
cook
in
the
best
manner
i
will
be
down
during
the
morning
to
make
some
lemon
puddings
be
sure
to
have
a
good
fire
in
the
range
and
see
that
all
the
drafts
are
clear
kitty
promised
that
every
thing
should
be
right
and
i
went
up
stairs
in
due
time
the
marketing
came
home
about
eleven
i
repaired
to
the
kitchen
and
much
to
my
surprise
found
all
in
disorder
what
in
the
world
have
you
been
doing
all
the
morning
said
i
feeling
a
little
fretted
kitty
excused
herself
good
naturedly
and
commenced
bustling
about
to
put
things
to
rights
while
i
got
flour
and
other
articles
necessary
for
my
purpose
and
went
to
work
at
my
lemon
puddings
which
were
in
due
time
ready
for
the
oven
giving
all
necessary
directions
as
to
their
baking
and
charging
kitty
to
be
sure
to
have
every
thing
on
the
table
precisely
at
our
usual
hour
for
dining
i
went
up
into
the
nursery
to
look
after
the
children
and
to
see
about
other
matters
requiring
my
attention
time
passed
on
until
to
my
surprise
i
heard
the
clock
strike
one
i
had
yet
to
dress
for
dinner
i
wonder
how
kitty
is
coming
on
said
i
to
myself
i
hope
she
will
not
let
the
puddings
get
all
dried
up
but
i
felt
too
much
in
a
hurry
to
go
down
and
satisfy
myself
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
kitchen
and
took
it
for
granted
that
all
was
right
a
little
while
afterwards
i
perceived
an
odor
as
of
something
burning
what
is
that
came
instinctively
from
my
lips
if
kitty
has
let
the
puddings
burn
quick
as
thought
i
turned
from
my
room
and
went
gliding
down
stairs
as
i
neared
the
kitchen
the
smell
of
burned
flour
or
pastry
grew
stronger
all
was
silent
below
and
i
approached
in
silence
on
entering
kitty
domain
i
perceived
that
lady
seated
in
front
of
the
range
with
a
brown
covered
pamphlet
novel
held
close
to
her
face
in
the
pages
of
which
she
was
completely
lost
i
never
saw
any
one
more
entirely
absorbed
in
a
book
no
sign
of
dinner
was
any
where
to
be
seen
upon
the
range
was
a
kettle
of
water
boiling
over
into
the
fire
and
from
one
of
the
ovens
poured
forth
a
dark
smoke
that
told
too
plainly
the
ruin
of
my
lemon
puddings
and
to
cap
all
the
turkey
yet
guiltless
of
fire
or
dripping
pan
was
upon
the
floor
in
possession
of
a
strange
cat
which
had
come
in
through
the
open
window
bending
over
the
still
entranced
cook
i
read
the
title
of
her
book
it
was
the
wandering
jew
kitty
i
do
much
wonder
now
at
the
start
she
gave
for
i
presume
there
was
not
the
zephyr
softness
in
my
voice
oh
she
caught
her
breath
as
her
eyes
rested
upon
the
cat
and
the
turkey
indeed
and
then
she
made
a
spring
towards
puss
who
nimbly
eluding
her
passed
out
by
the
way
through
which
she
had
come
in
by
this
time
i
had
jerked
open
the
oven
door
when
there
came
rushing
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
which
instantly
filled
the
room
my
puddings
were
burned
to
a
crisp
as
for
the
turkey
the
cat
had
eaten
off
one
side
of
the
breast
and
it
was
no
longer
fit
for
the
table
well
this
is
fine
work
said
i
in
an
angry
yet
despairing
voice
fine
work
upon
my
word
oh
kitty
interrupted
me
by
saying
i
run
right
off
and
buy
another
turkey
and
have
it
cooked
in
time
indeed
i
will
and
i
pay
for
it
it
all
my
fault
oh
dear
dear
me
now
do
be
angry
smith
i
have
dinner
all
ready
in
time
and
no
one
will
be
any
the
wiser
for
this
in
time
and
i
raised
my
finger
towards
the
kitchen
clock
the
hands
of
which
marked
the
period
of
half
past
one
two
was
our
regular
dinner
hour
mercy
ejaculated
the
frightened
cook
as
she
sank
back
upon
a
chair
i
thought
it
was
only
a
little
past
eleven
i
am
sure
it
was
only
eleven
when
i
sat
down
just
to
read
a
page
or
two
while
the
puddings
were
in
the
oven
the
truth
was
the
wandering
jew
in
the
most
exciting
portion
of
which
she
happened
to
be
proved
too
much
for
her
imagination
her
mind
had
taken
no
note
of
time
and
two
hours
passed
with
the
rapidity
of
a
few
minutes
i
do
exactly
comprehend
this
said
my
husband
as
he
sat
down
with
his
old
friend
to
dine
off
of
broiled
steak
and
potatoes
at
two
it
all
the
fault
of
the
jew
i
replied
making
an
effort
to
drive
away
with
a
smile
the
red
signs
of
mortification
that
were
in
my
face
the
wandering
jew
returned
my
husband
looking
mystified
yes
the
fault
lies
with
that
imaginary
personage
said
i
strange
as
it
may
seem
and
then
i
related
the
mishaps
of
the
morning
for
desert
we
had
some
preserved
fruit
and
cream
and
a
hearty
laugh
over
the
burnt
puddings
and
disfigured
turkey
poor
kitty
could
survive
the
mortification
she
never
smiled
again
in
my
house
and
at
the
close
of
the
week
removed
to
another
home
chapter
iii
light
on
the
subject
the
oil
out
mum
said
hannah
the
domestic
who
succeeded
kitty
pushing
her
head
into
the
room
where
i
sat
sewing
it
ca
be
i
replied
indade
mum
and
it
is
there
is
the
full
of
a
lamp
left
was
the
positive
answer
then
what
have
you
done
with
it
said
i
in
a
firm
voice
it
is
four
days
since
a
gallon
was
sent
home
from
the
store
four
days
it
more
nor
a
week
mum
do
tell
me
that
hannah
i
replied
firmly
for
i
know
better
i
was
out
on
last
monday
and
told
brown
to
send
us
home
a
gallon
sure
and
it
burned
mum
thin
what
else
could
go
with
it
it
never
was
burned
in
our
lamps
said
i
in
answer
to
this
you
either
wasted
it
or
given
it
away
at
this
hannah
as
in
honor
bound
became
highly
indignant
and
indulged
in
certain
impertinences
which
i
did
not
feel
inclined
to
notice
but
as
the
oil
was
all
gone
and
no
mistake
and
as
the
prospect
of
sitting
in
darkness
was
not
by
any
means
an
agreeable
one
the
only
remedy
was
to
order
another
gallon
something
was
wrong
that
was
clear
the
oil
had
never
been
burned
that
evening
myself
and
husband
talked
over
the
matter
and
both
of
us
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
never
do
the
evil
must
be
remedied
a
gallon
of
oil
must
not
again
disappear
in
four
days
why
said
my
husband
it
ought
to
last
us
at
least
a
week
and
a
half
not
quite
so
long
i
replied
we
burn
a
gallon
a
week
not
fairly
i
inclined
to
think
but
four
days
is
out
of
all
conscience
i
readily
assented
to
this
adding
some
trite
remark
about
the
unconscionable
wastefulness
of
domestics
on
the
next
morning
as
my
husband
arose
from
bed
he
shivered
in
the
chilly
air
saying
as
he
did
so
that
girl
let
the
fire
go
out
again
in
the
heater
is
it
too
bad
this
thing
happens
now
every
little
while
i
sure
i
said
enough
to
her
about
it
there
nothing
wanted
but
a
little
attention
it
is
too
bad
indeed
i
added
there
that
fishy
smell
again
exclaimed
smith
what
can
it
be
fishy
smell
so
there
is
did
you
get
any
mackerel
from
the
store
yesterday
none
perhaps
hannah
ordered
some
no
i
had
a
ham
sent
home
and
told
her
to
have
a
slice
of
that
broiled
for
breakfast
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
every
now
and
then
that
same
smell
comes
up
through
the
register
particularly
in
the
morning
i
bet
a
sixpence
there
some
old
fish
tub
in
the
cellar
of
which
made
kindling
that
may
be
it
said
i
and
for
want
of
a
better
reason
we
agreed
for
the
time
being
upon
that
hypothesis
at
the
end
of
another
four
days
word
came
up
that
our
best
sperm
oil
for
which
we
paid
a
dollar
and
forty
cents
a
gallon
was
out
again
impossible
i
ejaculated
but
it
is
mum
said
hannah
there
not
a
scrimption
left
not
so
much
as
the
full
of
a
thimble
you
must
be
mistaken
a
gallon
of
oil
has
never
been
burned
in
this
house
in
four
days
we
burned
the
other
gallon
in
four
days
said
hannah
with
provoking
coolness
the
evenings
are
very
long
and
we
have
a
great
many
lights
there
the
parlor
light
and
the
passage
light
and
the
it
no
use
for
you
to
talk
hannah
i
replied
interrupting
her
no
use
in
the
world
a
gallon
of
oil
in
four
days
has
never
gone
by
fair
means
in
this
house
so
do
try
to
make
me
believe
it
for
i
wo
i
too
old
a
housekeeper
for
that
finding
that
i
was
not
to
be
convinced
hannah
became
angry
and
said
something
about
her
not
being
a
thafe
i
was
unmoved
by
this
however
and
told
her
with
as
much
sternness
of
manner
as
i
could
assume
that
i
should
hold
her
responsible
for
any
future
waste
of
the
article
and
that
if
she
did
not
feel
inclined
to
remain
on
such
terms
she
had
better
go
dade
thin
and
i
go
to
onst
was
the
girl
spirited
answer
very
well
hannah
you
are
your
own
mistress
in
this
respect
said
i
coolly
i
not
in
the
least
troubled
about
filling
your
place
nor
fearful
of
getting
one
who
will
waste
a
gallon
of
oil
in
four
days
hannah
retired
from
my
presence
in
high
indignation
and
i
fully
expected
that
she
would
desert
my
house
forthwith
but
no
unlike
some
others
of
her
class
she
knew
when
she
had
a
good
place
and
had
sense
enough
to
keep
it
as
long
as
she
could
stay
in
due
time
she
cooled
off
and
i
heard
no
more
about
her
getting
another
place
there
that
fishy
smell
again
exclaimed
my
husband
as
he
arose
up
in
bed
one
morning
a
day
or
two
afterwards
and
snuffed
the
air
and
as
i
live
the
fire
in
the
heater
is
all
out
again
i
have
some
light
on
this
subject
see
if
i
do
and
he
sprung
upon
the
floor
at
the
same
time
hurriedly
putting
on
his
dressing
gown
and
a
pair
of
slippers
where
are
you
going
said
i
seeing
him
moving
towards
the
door
to
find
out
where
this
fishy
smell
comes
from
he
replied
disappearing
as
he
spoke
in
about
five
minutes
smith
returned
well
if
that
do
beat
all
he
exclaimed
as
he
the
chamber
what
i
very
naturally
enquired
i
found
out
all
about
that
fishy
smell
said
he
what
about
it
where
does
it
come
from
you
would
guess
in
a
month
of
sundays
well
this
is
a
great
world
live
and
learn
explain
yourself
smith
i
all
impatience
i
will
and
in
a
few
words
the
fire
was
out
in
the
heater
yes
and
i
very
naturally
took
my
way
down
to
where
i
expected
to
find
our
lady
at
work
in
the
process
well
sure
enough
there
she
was
kindling
the
fire
with
a
vengeance
with
what
i
asked
with
a
vengeance
yes
with
a
vengeance
to
my
pocket
she
had
the
oil
can
in
her
hands
and
was
pouring
its
contents
freely
into
the
furnace
in
order
to
quicken
combustion
i
now
understand
all
about
this
fishy
smell
and
i
all
about
the
remarkable
disappearance
of
a
gallon
of
oil
in
four
days
kindling
the
fire
with
dollar
and
forty
cent
oil
even
so
what
did
you
say
to
her
mr
smith
nothing
but
i
rather
think
she
not
want
me
to
look
at
her
again
the
huzzy
kindling
fire
with
my
best
sperm
oil
well
i
ca
get
over
that
something
in
this
wise
i
continued
to
ejaculate
now
and
then
until
my
astonishment
fairly
wore
itself
out
i
did
consider
it
worth
while
to
say
any
thing
to
hannah
when
i
went
down
stairs
thinking
it
best
to
let
the
look
my
husband
spoke
of
do
its
work
by
the
way
i
do
much
wonder
that
she
was
frightened
at
his
look
for
he
can
but
i
forgot
i
am
speaking
of
my
husband
and
he
might
happen
to
read
this
of
course
hannah
days
in
my
house
were
numbered
no
faith
was
to
be
placed
in
a
creature
who
could
so
shamefully
destroy
a
useful
article
placed
in
her
hands
if
she
would
burn
up
the
oil
it
was
but
fair
to
infer
that
she
would
as
remorselessly
make
way
with
other
things
so
i
parted
with
her
she
begged
me
to
let
her
stay
and
made
all
sorts
of
promises
but
i
was
immovable
whether
i
bettered
myself
in
the
change
is
somewhat
doubtful
chapter
iv
cheap
furniture
one
of
the
cardinal
virtues
at
least
for
housekeepers
who
are
not
overburdened
in
the
matter
of
income
is
economy
in
the
early
part
of
our
married
life
smith
and
myself
were
forced
to
the
practice
of
this
virtue
or
incur
debt
of
which
both
of
us
had
a
natural
horror
for
a
few
years
we
lived
in
the
plain
style
with
which
we
had
begun
the
world
but
when
our
circumstances
improved
we
very
naturally
desired
to
improve
the
appearance
of
things
in
our
household
our
cane
seat
chairs
and
ingrain
carpet
looked
less
and
less
attractive
every
day
and
when
we
went
out
to
spend
an
evening
socially
with
our
friends
the
contrast
between
home
and
abroad
was
strikingly
apparent
to
our
minds
i
think
said
smith
to
me
one
day
that
it
is
time
we
our
parlors
if
you
can
afford
the
outlay
i
remarked
it
wo
cost
a
great
deal
he
returned
not
over
three
hundred
dollars
said
smith
shook
his
head
as
he
answered
half
that
sum
ought
to
be
sufficient
what
will
we
want
a
dozen
mahogany
chairs
to
begin
with
i
replied
there
will
be
sixty
dollars
you
do
expect
to
pay
five
dollars
for
chairs
said
my
husband
in
a
tone
of
surprise
i
do
think
you
can
get
good
ones
for
less
indeed
we
can
i
was
looking
at
a
very
handsome
set
yesterday
and
the
man
only
asked
four
dollars
for
them
i
do
in
the
least
doubt
that
i
could
get
them
for
three
and
a
half
and
a
dear
bargain
you
would
make
of
that
i
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
it
is
poor
economy
smith
to
buy
cheap
furniture
it
costs
a
great
deal
more
in
the
end
than
good
furniture
and
never
gives
you
any
satisfaction
but
these
were
good
chairs
jane
as
good
as
i
would
wish
to
look
at
the
man
said
they
were
from
one
of
the
best
shops
in
the
city
and
of
superior
workmanship
and
finish
as
i
make
it
a
point
never
to
prolong
an
argument
with
my
husband
when
i
see
his
mind
bent
in
one
direction
i
did
not
urge
my
view
of
the
case
any
farther
it
was
settled
however
that
we
could
afford
to
our
parlors
in
a
better
style
and
that
in
the
course
of
the
coming
week
we
should
go
out
together
and
select
a
brussels
carpet
a
sofa
a
dozen
mahogany
chairs
a
centre
table
as
i
had
foreseen
from
the
beginning
my
husband
ideas
of
economy
were
destined
to
mar
everything
at
one
of
the
cabinet
was
a
very
neat
set
of
chairs
for
which
five
dollars
and
a
half
were
asked
but
which
the
dealer
seeing
that
he
was
beyond
our
mark
offered
for
five
dollars
they
were
cheap
at
that
price
but
smith
could
not
see
that
they
were
a
whit
better
than
the
set
of
chairs
just
mentioned
as
offered
for
four
dollars
and
which
he
was
satisfied
could
be
bought
for
three
and
a
half
so
i
went
with
him
to
look
at
them
they
proved
to
be
showy
enough
if
that
were
any
recommendation
but
had
a
common
look
in
my
eyes
they
were
not
to
be
compared
with
the
set
we
had
just
been
examining
now
are
they
not
very
beautiful
jane
said
my
husband
to
me
they
are
quite
as
handsome
as
those
we
were
asked
sixty
dollars
for
from
this
i
could
not
but
dissent
seeing
which
the
cunning
dealer
came
quickly
to
my
husband
side
of
the
question
with
various
convincing
arguments
among
the
strongest
of
which
was
an
abatement
in
the
price
of
the
chairs
he
seeing
it
to
be
for
his
interest
to
offer
them
for
three
dollars
and
i
give
you
three
and
said
smith
promptly
too
little
that
sir
returned
the
dealer
i
do
make
a
cent
on
them
at
three
and
they
are
fully
equal
in
every
respect
to
the
chairs
you
were
offered
at
five
dollars
i
know
the
manufacturer
and
have
had
his
articles
often
say
three
and
and
it
a
bargain
was
the
only
reply
made
to
this
by
my
economical
husband
i
was
greatly
in
hopes
that
the
man
would
decline
this
offer
but
was
disappointed
he
hesitated
for
some
time
and
at
last
said
well
i
do
care
take
them
along
though
it
is
throwing
them
away
such
a
bargain
you
will
never
get
again
if
you
live
to
be
as
old
as
mathuselah
but
now
do
you
want
something
else
i
can
sell
you
cheaper
and
better
articles
in
the
furniture
line
than
you
can
get
in
the
city
small
profits
and
quick
sales
i
go
in
for
the
nimble
sixpence
my
husband
was
in
the
sphere
of
attraction
and
i
saw
that
it
would
take
a
stronger
effort
on
my
part
to
draw
him
out
than
i
wished
to
make
so
i
yielded
with
as
good
a
grace
as
possible
and
aided
in
the
selection
of
a
cheap
sofa
a
cheap
overgrown
centre
table
and
two
or
three
other
article
that
were
almost
thrown
away
well
our
parlor
was
furnished
with
its
new
dress
in
good
time
and
made
quite
a
respectable
appearance
smith
was
delighted
with
everything
the
more
particularly
as
the
cost
had
been
so
moderate
i
had
my
own
thoughts
on
the
subject
and
looked
very
confidently
for
some
evidences
of
imperfection
in
our
great
bargains
i
was
not
very
long
kept
in
suspense
one
morning
about
two
weeks
after
all
had
been
fitted
out
so
elegantly
while
engaged
in
dusting
the
chairs
a
part
of
the
mahogany
ornament
in
the
back
of
one
of
them
fell
off
on
the
next
day
another
showed
the
same
evidence
of
imperfect
workmanship
a
few
evenings
afterwards
as
we
sat
at
the
centre
table
one
of
our
children
leaned
on
it
rather
heavily
when
there
was
a
sudden
crack
and
the
side
upon
which
he
was
bearing
his
weight
swayed
down
the
distance
of
half
an
inch
or
more
the
next
untoward
event
was
the
dropping
of
one
of
its
feet
by
the
sofa
and
the
warping
up
of
a
large
piece
of
veneering
on
the
back
while
lamenting
over
this
we
discovered
a
broken
spring
ready
to
make
its
way
through
the
hair
cloth
covering
so
much
for
cheap
furniture
said
i
in
a
tone
of
involuntary
triumph
my
husband
looked
at
me
half
reproachfully
and
so
i
said
no
more
it
was
now
needful
to
send
for
a
cabinet
maker
and
submit
our
sofa
and
chairs
to
his
handy
workmanship
he
quickly
discovered
other
imperfections
and
gave
us
the
consoling
information
that
our
fine
furniture
was
little
above
in
quality
and
dear
at
any
price
a
ten
dollar
bill
was
required
to
pay
the
damage
they
had
already
sustained
even
under
our
careful
hands
a
more
striking
evidence
of
our
folly
in
buying
cheap
furniture
was
however
yet
to
come
an
intimate
friend
came
in
one
evening
to
sit
a
few
hours
with
us
after
conversing
for
a
time
both
he
and
my
husband
took
up
books
and
commenced
reading
while
i
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
to
write
a
brief
letter
our
visitor
who
was
a
pretty
stout
man
had
the
bad
fault
of
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
balancing
himself
on
its
hind
legs
an
experiment
most
trying
to
the
best
mahogany
chairs
that
were
ever
made
we
were
all
sitting
around
the
centre
table
upon
which
burned
a
tall
astral
lamp
and
i
was
getting
absorbed
in
my
letter
when
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
crash
followed
by
the
breaking
of
the
table
from
its
centre
and
the
pitching
over
of
the
astral
lamp
which
in
falling
just
grazed
my
side
and
went
down
oil
and
all
upon
our
new
carpet
an
instant
more
and
we
were
in
total
darkness
but
ere
the
light
went
out
a
glance
had
revealed
a
scene
that
i
shall
never
forget
our
visitor
whose
weight
as
he
tried
his
usual
balancing
experiment
had
caused
the
slender
legs
of
his
chair
to
snap
off
short
had
fallen
backwards
in
trying
to
save
himself
he
had
caught
at
the
table
and
wrenched
that
from
its
centre
fastening
startled
by
this
sudden
catastrophe
my
husband
had
sprung
to
his
feet
grasping
his
chair
with
the
intent
of
drawing
it
away
when
the
top
of
the
back
came
off
in
his
hand
i
saw
all
this
at
a
single
glance
and
then
we
were
shrouded
in
darkness
of
the
scene
that
followed
i
will
not
speak
my
lady
readers
can
without
any
effort
of
the
mind
imagine
something
of
its
unpleasant
reality
as
for
our
visitor
when
lights
were
brought
in
he
was
no
where
to
be
seen
i
have
a
faint
recollection
of
having
heard
the
street
door
shut
amid
the
confusion
that
succeeded
the
incident
just
described
about
a
week
afterwards
the
whole
of
our
cheap
furniture
was
sent
to
auction
where
it
brought
less
than
half
its
first
cost
it
was
then
replaced
with
good
articles
by
good
workmen
at
a
fair
price
not
one
of
which
has
cost
us
to
this
day
a
single
cent
for
repairs
a
housekeeping
friend
of
mine
committed
not
long
since
a
similar
error
her
husband
could
spare
her
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
for
purposes
but
as
his
business
absorbed
nearly
all
of
his
time
and
thoughts
he
left
with
her
the
selection
of
the
new
articles
that
were
to
beautify
their
parlors
and
chambers
merely
saying
to
her
let
what
you
get
be
good
it
is
cheapest
in
the
end
well
my
friend
had
set
her
heart
on
a
dozen
chairs
a
new
sofa
centre
table
and
for
her
parlors
and
on
a
mahogany
bedstead
and
for
her
chamber
besides
a
new
chamber
carpet
her
first
visit
was
to
the
of
one
of
our
best
cabinet
makers
but
his
prices
completely
frightened
her
for
at
his
rate
the
articles
she
wanted
would
amount
to
more
than
all
the
money
she
had
to
spend
and
leave
nothing
for
the
new
chamber
carpet
i
must
buy
cheaper
said
she
the
cheapest
is
generally
dearest
in
the
end
returned
the
cabinet
maker
i
do
know
about
that
remarked
the
lady
whose
thoughts
did
not
take
in
the
meaning
of
the
man
words
all
i
know
is
that
i
can
get
as
good
articles
as
i
desire
at
lower
prices
than
you
ask
it
did
not
once
occur
to
my
friend
that
it
would
be
wisest
to
lessen
the
number
of
articles
and
get
the
remainder
of
the
first
quality
no
her
heart
covered
the
whole
inventory
at
first
made
out
and
nothing
less
would
answer
so
she
went
to
an
auction
store
and
bought
inferior
articles
at
lower
prices
i
visited
her
soon
after
she
showed
me
her
bargains
and
with
an
air
of
exultation
spoke
of
the
cost
what
do
you
think
i
paid
for
this
said
she
referring
to
a
showy
and
as
she
spoke
she
took
hold
of
the
suspended
and
moved
the
upper
portion
of
it
forward
only
seventeen
dollars
the
words
had
scarcely
passed
her
lips
ere
the
broke
away
from
one
of
the
screws
that
held
it
in
the
standards
and
fell
crashing
at
our
feet
it
cost
just
seven
dollars
to
replace
the
glass
but
that
was
not
all
over
thirty
dollars
were
paid
during
the
first
year
for
repairs
and
this
is
only
the
beginning
of
troubles
cheap
furniture
is
in
most
cases
the
dearest
that
housekeepers
can
buy
it
is
always
breaking
and
usually
costs
more
in
a
year
or
two
than
the
difference
between
its
price
and
that
of
articles
to
say
nothing
of
the
vexation
and
want
of
satisfaction
that
always
attends
its
possession
better
be
content
with
fewer
articles
if
the
purse
be
low
and
have
them
good
while
on
this
subject
i
will
incorporate
in
these
confessions
an
experience
of
my
sister
and
her
husband
and
john
jones
jones
is
in
some
respects
very
much
like
smith
and
as
will
be
seen
in
the
story
about
to
be
given
my
sister
ideas
of
things
and
my
own
run
quite
parallel
to
each
other
the
story
has
found
its
way
elsewhere
into
print
for
jones
like
myself
has
a
natural
fondness
for
types
but
its
repetition
here
will
do
no
harm
and
bring
it
before
many
who
would
not
otherwise
see
it
chapter
is
it
economy
the
experience
of
my
relative
john
jones
referred
to
in
the
preceding
chapter
is
given
in
what
follows
after
reading
it
we
think
that
few
young
housekeepers
will
commit
the
folly
of
indulging
to
any
very
great
extent
in
cheap
furniture
we
had
been
married
five
years
and
during
the
time
had
boarded
for
economy
sake
but
the
addition
of
one
after
another
to
our
family
admonished
us
that
it
was
getting
time
to
enlarge
our
borders
and
so
we
were
determined
to
go
to
housekeeping
in
matters
of
domestic
economy
both
my
wife
and
myself
were
a
little
green
but
i
think
that
i
was
the
greenest
of
the
two
to
get
a
house
was
our
first
concern
and
to
select
furniture
was
our
next
the
house
was
found
after
two
months
diligent
search
and
at
the
expense
of
a
good
deal
of
precious
shoe
leather
save
me
from
another
siege
at
i
would
about
as
soon
undertake
to
build
a
suitable
dwelling
with
my
own
hands
as
to
find
one
exactly
the
thing
already
up
and
waiting
with
open
doors
for
a
tenant
all
the
really
desirable
houses
that
we
found
ticketed
to
let
were
at
least
two
prices
above
our
limit
and
most
of
those
within
our
means
we
would
hardly
have
lived
in
rent
free
at
last
however
we
found
a
cosey
little
nest
of
a
house
just
built
and
clean
and
neat
as
a
new
pin
from
top
to
bottom
it
suited
us
to
a
and
now
came
the
next
most
important
business
selecting
furniture
my
wife
ideas
had
always
been
a
little
in
advance
of
mine
that
is
she
liked
to
have
every
thing
of
the
best
quality
and
had
the
weakness
so
to
speak
of
desiring
to
make
an
appearance
as
my
income
at
the
time
was
but
moderate
and
the
prospect
of
an
increase
thereof
not
very
flattering
i
felt
like
being
exceedingly
prudent
in
all
outlays
for
furniture
we
must
be
content
with
things
few
and
plain
said
i
as
we
sat
down
one
morning
to
figure
up
what
we
must
get
but
let
them
be
good
said
my
wife
strong
and
substantial
was
my
reply
but
we
ca
afford
to
pay
for
much
extra
polish
and
filigree
work
i
do
want
any
thing
very
extra
jones
returned
my
wife
a
little
uneasily
though
what
i
do
have
i
would
like
good
it
no
economy
in
the
end
to
buy
cheap
things
the
emphasis
on
the
word
cheap
rather
grated
on
my
ear
for
i
was
in
favor
of
getting
every
thing
as
cheap
as
possible
what
kind
of
chairs
did
you
think
of
getting
asked
jones
a
handsome
set
of
i
replied
thinking
that
in
this
at
least
i
would
be
even
with
her
ideas
on
the
subject
of
parlor
chairs
but
her
face
did
not
brighten
what
would
you
like
said
i
i
believe
it
would
be
more
economical
in
the
end
to
get
good
stuffed
seat
mahogany
chairs
replied
jones
at
five
dollars
ellen
yes
even
at
five
dollars
they
would
last
us
our
while
chairs
if
we
get
them
will
have
to
be
renewed
two
or
three
times
and
cost
a
great
deal
more
in
the
end
without
being
half
so
comfortable
or
looking
well
sixty
dollars
for
a
dozen
chairs
when
very
good
ones
can
be
had
for
dollars
indeed
ellen
we
must
think
of
such
a
thing
we
ca
afford
it
remember
there
are
a
great
many
other
things
to
buy
i
know
dear
but
i
am
sure
it
will
be
much
more
economical
in
the
end
for
us
to
diminish
the
number
of
articles
and
add
to
the
quality
of
what
we
do
have
i
am
very
much
like
the
poor
woman
who
preferred
a
cup
of
clear
strong
fragrant
coffee
three
times
a
week
to
a
decoction
of
burnt
rye
every
day
what
i
have
i
do
like
good
and
so
do
i
ellen
but
as
i
said
before
there
will
be
diminish
as
we
may
a
great
many
things
to
buy
and
we
must
make
the
cost
of
each
as
small
as
possible
we
must
not
think
of
such
extravagance
as
mahogany
chairs
now
at
some
other
time
we
may
get
them
my
wife
here
gave
up
the
point
and
what
i
thought
a
little
remarkable
made
no
more
points
on
the
subject
of
furniture
i
had
every
thing
my
own
way
i
bought
cheap
to
my
heart
content
it
was
only
necessary
for
me
to
express
my
approval
of
an
article
for
her
to
assent
to
its
purchase
as
to
patronizing
your
fashionable
cabinet
makers
and
upholsterers
we
were
not
guilty
of
the
folly
but
bought
at
reasonable
rates
from
auction
stores
and
at
public
sales
our
parlor
carpets
cost
but
ninety
cents
a
yard
and
were
handsomer
than
those
for
which
a
lady
of
our
acquaintance
paid
a
dollar
and
our
chairs
were
of
a
neat
fancy
pattern
and
had
cost
thirty
dollars
a
dozen
we
had
hesitated
for
some
time
between
a
set
at
dollars
a
dozen
and
these
but
the
style
being
so
much
more
attractive
we
let
our
taste
govern
in
the
selection
the
price
of
our
sofa
was
eighteen
dollars
and
i
thought
it
a
really
genteel
affair
though
my
wife
was
not
in
raptures
about
it
a
pair
of
card
tables
for
fifteen
dollars
and
a
centre
table
for
fourteen
gave
our
parlors
quite
a
handsome
appearance
i
would
ask
any
thing
more
comfortable
or
genteel
than
this
said
i
when
the
parlors
were
all
fixed
right
jones
looked
pleased
with
the
appearance
of
things
but
did
not
express
herself
extravagantly
in
selecting
our
chamber
furniture
a
handsome
and
french
bedstead
that
my
wife
went
to
look
at
in
the
of
a
cabinet
maker
tempted
her
strongly
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
i
could
get
her
ideas
back
to
a
regular
maple
a
plain
ten
dollar
bureau
and
a
two
dollar
twenty
and
thirty
dollar
mattresses
too
were
in
her
mind
but
when
articles
of
the
kind
just
as
good
to
wear
could
be
had
at
eight
and
ten
dollars
where
was
the
use
of
wasting
money
in
going
higher
the
ratio
of
cost
set
down
against
the
foregoing
articles
was
maintained
from
garret
to
kitchen
and
i
was
agreeably
disappointed
to
find
after
the
last
bill
for
purchases
was
paid
that
i
was
within
the
limit
of
expenditures
i
had
proposed
to
make
by
over
a
hundred
dollars
the
change
from
a
to
a
comfortable
home
was
indeed
pleasant
we
could
never
get
done
talking
about
it
every
thing
was
so
quiet
so
new
so
clean
and
so
orderly
this
is
living
would
drop
from
our
lips
a
dozen
times
a
week
one
day
about
three
months
after
we
had
commenced
housekeeping
i
came
home
and
on
entering
the
parlor
the
first
thing
that
met
my
eyes
was
a
large
spot
of
white
on
the
new
sofa
a
piece
of
the
veneering
had
been
knocked
off
completely
disfiguring
it
what
did
that
i
asked
of
my
wife
in
setting
back
a
chair
that
i
had
dusted
she
replied
one
of
the
feet
touched
the
sofa
lightly
when
off
dropped
that
veneer
like
a
loose
flake
i
been
examining
the
sofa
since
and
find
that
it
is
a
very
bad
piece
of
work
just
look
here
and
she
drew
me
over
to
the
place
where
my
eighteen
dollar
sofa
stood
and
pointed
out
sundry
large
seams
that
had
gaped
open
loose
spots
in
the
veneering
and
rickety
joints
i
saw
now
what
i
had
not
before
seen
that
the
whole
article
was
of
exceedingly
common
material
and
common
workmanship
a
miserable
piece
of
furniture
said
i
it
is
indeed
returned
jones
to
buy
an
article
like
this
is
little
better
than
throwing
money
into
the
street
for
a
month
the
disfigured
sofa
remained
in
the
parlor
a
perfect
when
another
piece
of
the
veneering
sloughed
off
and
one
of
the
feet
became
loose
it
was
then
sent
to
a
cabinet
maker
for
repair
and
cost
for
removing
and
mending
just
five
dollars
not
long
after
this
the
bureau
had
to
take
a
like
journey
for
it
had
strangely
enough
fallen
into
sudden
dilapidation
all
the
locks
were
out
of
order
half
the
knobs
were
off
there
was
not
a
drawer
that
did
require
the
most
accurate
balancing
of
forces
in
order
to
get
it
shut
after
it
was
once
open
and
it
showed
premonitory
symptoms
of
shedding
its
skin
like
a
snake
a
five
dollar
bill
was
expended
in
putting
this
into
something
like
order
and
respectable
aspect
by
this
time
a
new
set
of
castors
was
needed
for
the
maple
which
was
obtained
at
the
expense
of
two
dollars
moreover
the
to
said
which
from
its
exceeding
ugliness
had
from
the
first
been
a
terrible
to
jones
as
well
as
to
myself
was
about
this
period
removed
and
one
of
more
sightly
appearance
substituted
at
the
additional
charge
of
six
dollars
no
tester
frame
had
accompanied
the
cheap
bedstead
at
its
original
purchase
and
now
my
wife
wished
to
have
one
and
also
a
light
curtain
above
and
valance
below
all
these
with
trimmings
to
match
cost
the
round
sum
of
ten
dollars
it
looks
very
neat
said
jones
after
her
curtains
were
up
it
does
indeed
said
i
still
returned
jones
i
would
much
rather
have
had
a
handsome
mahogany
french
bedstead
so
would
i
was
my
answer
but
you
know
they
cost
some
thirty
dollars
and
we
paid
but
sixteen
for
this
sixteen
said
my
wife
turning
quickly
toward
me
it
cost
more
than
that
oh
no
i
have
the
bill
in
my
desk
was
my
confident
answer
sixteen
was
originally
paid
i
know
said
jones
but
then
remember
what
it
has
cost
since
two
dollars
for
castors
six
for
a
new
and
ten
for
tester
and
curtains
dollars
in
all
when
a
very
handsome
french
bedstead
of
good
workmanship
can
be
bought
for
thirty
dollars
i
must
own
that
i
was
taken
somewhat
aback
by
this
array
of
figures
that
do
lie
and
for
twenty
dollars
we
could
have
bought
a
neat
well
made
at
moore
and
campion
that
would
have
lasted
for
twice
as
many
years
and
always
looked
in
credit
but
ours
you
know
only
cost
ten
said
i
the
bureau
such
as
it
is
cost
ten
and
the
glass
two
add
five
that
we
have
already
paid
for
repairs
and
the
four
that
our
maple
bedstead
has
cost
above
the
price
of
a
handsome
french
one
and
we
will
have
the
sum
of
dollars
enough
to
purchase
as
handsome
a
as
i
would
ask
so
you
see
jones
that
our
cheap
furniture
is
not
going
to
turn
out
so
cheap
after
all
and
as
for
looks
why
no
one
can
say
there
is
much
to
brag
of
this
was
a
new
view
of
the
case
and
certainly
one
not
very
flattering
to
my
economical
vanity
i
gave
in
of
course
and
admitted
that
jones
was
right
but
the
dilapidations
and
expenses
for
repairs
to
which
i
have
just
referred
were
but
as
the
beginning
of
sorrows
it
took
about
three
years
to
show
the
full
fruits
of
my
error
by
the
end
of
that
time
half
my
parlor
chairs
had
been
rendered
useless
in
consequence
of
the
and
ordeals
through
which
they
had
been
called
to
pass
the
sofa
was
unanimously
condemned
to
the
dining
room
and
the
ninety
cent
carpet
had
gone
on
fading
and
defacing
until
my
wife
said
she
was
ashamed
to
put
it
even
on
her
chambers
for
repairs
our
furniture
had
cost
up
to
this
period
to
say
nothing
of
the
perpetual
annoyance
of
having
it
put
out
of
order
and
running
for
the
cabinet
maker
and
upholsterer
not
less
than
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
finally
i
grew
desperate
i
have
decent
well
made
furniture
let
it
cost
what
it
will
said
i
to
jones
you
will
find
it
cheapest
in
the
end
was
her
quiet
reply
on
the
next
day
we
went
to
a
cabinet
maker
whose
reputation
for
good
work
stood
among
the
highest
in
the
city
and
ordered
new
parlor
and
chamber
furniture
mahogany
chairs
french
bedstead
and
all
and
as
soon
as
they
came
home
cleared
the
house
of
all
the
old
cheap
dear
trash
with
which
we
had
been
worried
since
the
day
we
commenced
housekeeping
a
good
many
years
have
passed
since
and
we
have
not
paid
the
first
five
dollar
bill
for
repairs
all
the
drawers
run
as
smoothly
as
railroad
cars
knobs
are
tight
locks
in
prime
order
and
veneers
cling
as
tightly
to
their
places
as
if
they
had
grown
there
all
is
right
and
tight
and
wears
an
orderly
genteel
appearance
and
what
is
best
of
all
the
cost
of
every
thing
we
have
good
as
it
is
is
far
below
the
cost
of
what
is
inferior
it
is
better
much
better
said
i
to
jones
the
other
day
better
was
her
reply
yes
indeed
a
thousand
times
better
to
have
good
things
at
once
cheap
furniture
is
dearest
in
the
end
every
housekeeper
ought
to
know
this
in
the
beginning
if
we
had
known
it
see
what
we
would
have
saved
if
had
known
it
you
mean
said
i
my
wife
looked
kindly
not
triumphantly
into
my
face
and
smiled
when
she
again
spoke
it
was
on
another
subject
chapter
vi
living
at
a
convenient
distance
there
are
few
of
us
who
do
not
feel
at
some
time
in
life
the
desire
for
change
indeed
change
of
place
corresponding
as
it
does
in
outward
nature
to
change
of
state
in
the
mind
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
we
should
now
and
then
feel
a
strong
desire
to
remove
from
the
old
and
get
into
new
locations
and
amid
different
external
associations
thus
we
find
in
many
families
an
ever
recurring
tendency
to
removal
indeed
i
have
some
housekeeping
friends
who
are
rarely
to
be
found
in
the
same
house
or
in
the
same
part
of
the
city
in
any
two
consecutive
years
three
moves
franklin
used
to
say
were
equal
to
a
fire
there
are
some
to
whom
i
could
point
who
have
been
if
this
holds
true
as
good
as
burned
out
three
or
four
times
in
the
last
ten
years
but
i
must
not
write
too
long
a
preface
to
my
present
story
smith
and
myself
can
not
boast
of
larger
organs
of
inhabitativeness
i
believe
that
is
the
word
used
by
phrenologists
than
many
of
our
neighbors
occasionally
we
have
felt
dissatisfied
with
the
state
of
things
around
us
and
become
possessed
of
the
demon
of
change
we
have
moved
quite
frequently
sometimes
attaining
superior
comfort
and
some
times
getting
rather
the
worst
of
it
for
the
change
a
few
years
ago
in
the
early
smith
said
to
me
one
day
i
noticed
in
riding
out
yesterday
a
very
pleasant
country
house
on
the
frankford
road
to
let
and
it
struck
me
that
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
us
both
as
to
health
and
comfort
to
rent
it
for
the
summer
season
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
always
loved
the
country
you
know
was
my
response
my
heart
had
leaped
at
the
proposition
it
is
such
a
convenient
distance
from
the
city
said
smith
how
far
about
four
miles
do
the
stages
pass
frequently
every
half
hour
and
the
fare
is
only
twelve
and
a
half
cents
so
low
that
is
certainly
an
inducement
yes
it
is
suppose
we
go
out
and
look
at
the
house
very
well
said
i
and
then
we
talked
over
the
pleasures
and
advantage
that
would
result
from
a
residence
in
the
country
at
such
a
convenient
distance
from
the
city
on
the
next
day
we
went
to
look
at
the
place
and
found
much
both
in
the
house
and
grounds
to
attract
us
there
was
a
fine
shaded
lawn
and
garden
with
a
stock
of
small
and
large
fruit
what
a
delightful
place
for
the
children
i
exclaimed
and
at
such
a
convenient
distance
from
the
city
said
my
husband
i
can
go
in
and
out
to
business
and
scarcely
miss
the
time
but
do
you
think
you
would
like
the
country
o
yes
i
always
loved
the
country
we
can
move
back
into
the
city
when
the
summer
closes
said
smith
why
not
remain
here
permanently
it
will
be
too
expensive
to
keep
both
a
city
and
country
house
i
returned
it
will
be
too
dreary
through
the
winter
i
do
think
so
i
always
feel
cheerful
in
the
country
and
then
you
know
the
house
is
at
such
a
convenient
distance
and
the
stages
pass
the
door
at
every
half
hour
you
can
get
to
business
as
easily
as
if
we
resided
in
the
city
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
change
and
so
it
happened
was
smith
the
more
we
thought
and
talked
about
the
matters
the
more
inclined
were
we
to
break
up
in
the
city
and
go
permanently
to
the
country
and
finally
we
resolved
to
try
the
experiment
so
the
pleasant
country
house
was
taken
and
the
town
house
given
up
and
in
due
time
we
took
our
flight
to
where
nature
had
just
carpeted
the
earth
in
freshest
green
and
caused
the
buds
to
expand
and
the
trees
of
the
forest
to
clothe
themselves
in
verdure
how
pleasant
was
every
thing
a
gardener
had
been
employed
to
put
the
garden
and
lawn
in
order
and
soon
we
were
delighted
to
see
the
first
shoots
from
seeds
that
had
been
planted
making
their
way
through
the
ground
to
me
all
was
delightful
i
felt
almost
as
as
a
child
and
never
tired
of
expressing
my
pleasure
at
the
change
come
and
see
us
said
i
to
one
city
friend
and
another
on
meeting
them
we
in
a
most
delightful
place
and
at
such
a
convenient
distance
from
the
city
just
get
into
the
frankford
omnibus
which
starts
from
hall
in
second
street
above
market
every
half
hour
and
you
will
come
to
our
very
door
and
i
shall
be
so
delighted
to
have
a
visit
from
you
in
moving
from
the
city
i
took
with
me
two
good
domestics
who
had
lived
in
my
family
for
over
a
year
each
had
expressed
herself
as
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
getting
into
the
country
and
i
was
delighted
to
think
they
were
so
well
satisfied
for
i
had
feared
lest
they
would
be
disinclined
to
accompany
us
about
a
month
after
our
removal
one
of
them
who
had
looked
dissatisfied
about
something
came
to
me
and
said
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
city
smith
i
do
like
living
in
the
country
very
well
i
replied
you
must
do
as
you
please
but
i
thought
you
preferred
this
to
the
city
i
thought
i
would
like
it
but
i
do
it
too
lonesome
i
did
not
persuade
her
to
stay
that
error
i
had
once
or
twice
ere
this
fallen
into
and
learned
to
avoid
it
in
future
so
she
went
back
to
the
city
and
i
was
left
with
but
a
single
girl
three
days
only
elapsed
before
this
one
announced
her
intended
departure
but
you
will
stay
said
i
until
i
can
get
some
one
in
your
place
my
week
will
be
up
on
saturday
was
replied
can
you
get
a
girl
by
that
time
that
leaves
me
only
two
days
mary
i
afraid
not
mary
looked
unamiable
enough
at
this
answer
we
said
no
more
to
each
other
in
the
afternoon
i
went
to
the
city
to
find
a
new
domestic
if
possible
but
returned
unsuccessful
saturday
came
and
to
my
surprise
and
trouble
mary
persisted
in
going
away
so
i
was
left
with
my
family
of
six
persons
without
any
domestic
at
all
sunday
proved
to
me
any
thing
but
a
day
of
rest
after
washing
and
dressing
the
children
preparing
breakfast
clearing
away
the
table
making
the
beds
and
putting
the
house
to
order
i
set
about
getting
dinner
this
meal
furnished
and
eaten
and
the
dishes
washed
and
put
away
i
found
myself
not
only
completely
tired
out
but
suffering
from
a
most
dreadful
headache
i
was
lying
down
about
four
in
a
and
sleeping
state
with
my
head
a
little
easier
when
my
husband
who
was
sitting
by
the
window
exclaimed
if
there
is
and
peters
and
their
three
children
getting
out
of
the
stage
not
coming
here
said
i
starting
up
in
bed
while
at
the
same
moment
my
headache
returned
with
a
throbbing
intensity
that
almost
blinded
me
yes
coming
here
replied
smith
how
unfortunate
came
from
my
lips
as
i
clasped
my
hands
to
my
temples
now
and
peters
were
people
for
whom
we
had
no
particular
friendship
we
visited
each
other
scarcely
once
a
year
and
had
never
reciprocated
an
evening
to
tea
true
i
had
on
the
occasion
of
meeting
peters
about
a
week
before
while
stopping
in
the
city
said
to
her
while
praising
my
new
country
home
you
must
come
and
see
me
sometime
during
the
summer
the
invitation
was
intended
as
a
compliment
more
than
anything
else
i
did
particularly
care
about
a
visit
from
her
and
certainly
had
no
idea
that
she
would
take
me
at
my
word
so
much
for
insincerity
go
down
and
ask
them
into
the
parlor
said
i
to
smith
i
will
dress
myself
and
join
you
in
a
little
while
in
about
half
an
hour
i
left
my
room
feeling
really
quite
unwell
i
found
my
visitors
walking
in
the
garden
and
their
children
ranging
about
like
wild
colts
to
the
particular
detriment
of
choice
shrubbery
and
garden
beds
oh
what
a
delightful
place
exclaimed
peters
on
my
meeting
her
i
really
envy
you
you
see
that
i
have
accepted
your
very
kind
invitation
i
said
to
my
husband
says
i
would
it
be
nice
to
make
the
smiths
a
visit
this
afternoon
they
live
at
such
a
convenient
distance
and
it
will
be
such
a
treat
to
the
children
well
just
as
you
like
said
peters
and
so
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
we
got
ready
and
came
out
oh
i
delighted
what
a
sweet
spot
you
have
chosen
i
shall
come
and
see
you
often
and
thus
she
ran
on
while
i
smiled
and
responded
with
all
due
politeness
and
to
a
certain
extent
hypocritical
pretence
of
pleasure
at
the
visit
they
had
come
to
spend
the
afternoon
and
take
tea
with
us
of
course
and
as
the
last
stage
went
by
at
seven
i
was
soon
under
the
necessity
of
leaving
my
guests
in
order
to
engage
in
certain
preliminary
acts
that
looked
towards
an
early
supper
oh
how
my
head
did
throb
and
with
what
an
effort
did
i
drag
my
weary
feet
about
but
the
longest
trial
the
most
painful
ordeal
has
an
end
and
the
end
of
this
came
at
length
our
visitors
after
spending
a
few
hours
and
being
served
with
tea
took
their
departure
assuring
us
as
they
did
so
that
they
had
spent
a
delightful
afternoon
and
would
be
certain
to
come
again
soon
in
ten
minutes
after
they
had
left
the
house
i
was
in
bed
two
whole
weeks
elapsed
before
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
girl
and
six
times
during
that
period
we
had
friends
out
from
the
city
to
take
tea
with
us
and
one
young
lady
spent
three
whole
days
when
the
season
of
fruits
came
as
we
had
a
few
apple
and
pear
trees
besides
a
strawberry
bed
and
a
fine
row
of
raspberry
bushes
our
city
friends
especially
those
who
had
children
were
even
more
particular
in
their
attentions
our
own
children
we
could
make
understand
the
propriety
of
leaving
the
small
fruit
to
be
picked
for
table
use
so
that
all
could
share
in
its
enjoyment
but
children
comprehended
nothing
of
this
and
rifled
our
beds
and
bushes
so
constantly
that
although
they
would
have
given
our
table
a
fair
supply
of
berries
in
the
season
we
never
once
could
get
enough
to
be
worth
using
and
so
were
forced
to
purchase
our
fruit
in
the
city
after
a
destructive
visitation
of
this
nature
during
strawberry
time
i
said
to
smith
as
he
was
leaving
for
the
city
one
morning
i
wish
you
would
take
a
small
basket
with
you
and
bring
out
two
or
three
quarts
of
strawberries
for
tea
i
only
tasted
them
once
or
twice
and
it
hopeless
to
think
of
getting
any
from
our
garden
well
when
smith
came
home
with
his
two
or
three
quarts
of
strawberries
we
had
six
women
and
children
visitors
from
the
city
to
partake
of
them
of
course
our
own
children
who
had
been
promised
strawberries
at
tea
time
and
who
had
been
looking
for
them
get
a
taste
and
thus
it
happened
over
and
over
again
as
the
weather
grew
warmer
and
warmer
particular
friends
whom
we
were
glad
to
see
and
friends
so
called
into
whose
houses
we
had
rarely
if
ever
ventured
came
out
to
get
a
mouthful
of
fresh
air
and
to
see
something
green
we
lived
at
such
a
convenient
distance
that
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
to
run
out
and
look
at
us
twice
again
during
the
summer
i
was
left
without
a
single
domestic
girls
did
like
to
leave
the
city
where
they
had
been
used
to
meeting
their
acquaintances
every
few
days
and
therefore
it
was
hard
to
retain
them
so
it
went
on
i
had
poor
help
and
was
overrun
with
company
at
such
a
rate
that
i
was
completely
worn
out
i
rarely
heard
the
rumble
of
the
approaching
stage
that
i
did
not
get
nervous
early
in
august
smith
said
to
me
one
evening
after
returning
from
the
city
on
that
very
morning
a
family
of
four
had
left
me
after
staying
three
days
i
met
gray
this
afternoon
and
he
told
me
that
they
were
coming
out
to
see
you
that
he
was
going
away
for
a
while
and
his
wife
thought
that
it
would
be
such
a
pleasant
time
to
redeem
her
promise
of
making
you
a
visit
oh
dear
what
next
i
exclaimed
in
a
distressed
voice
is
there
to
be
no
end
to
this
not
before
frost
i
presume
returned
smith
meaningly
i
wish
frost
would
come
along
quickly
then
was
my
response
but
how
long
is
gray
going
to
be
absent
from
home
he
did
say
and
we
to
have
his
whole
family
i
suppose
during
his
absence
doubtless
well
i
call
that
taxing
hospitality
and
good
feeling
a
little
too
far
i
do
want
them
here
i
no
room
for
them
without
inconvenience
to
ourselves
besides
my
help
is
poor
but
all
my
feelings
of
repugnance
were
of
no
avail
as
i
was
sitting
on
the
next
day
by
a
window
that
overlooked
the
road
i
saw
the
stage
draw
up
and
issue
therefrom
jones
jones
servant
and
five
children
two
of
the
latter
they
had
boxes
carpet
bags
bundles
indicating
a
prolonged
sojourn
and
one
little
boy
dragged
after
him
a
pet
dog
that
came
also
to
honor
us
with
a
visit
down
to
meet
them
at
the
door
with
as
good
a
grace
as
possible
i
hurried
words
of
welcome
and
pleasure
were
on
my
tongue
though
i
am
not
sure
that
my
face
did
not
belie
my
utterance
but
they
were
all
too
pleased
to
get
into
our
snug
country
quarters
to
perceive
any
drawback
in
their
reception
i
will
not
describe
my
experience
during
the
next
three
weeks
for
gray
took
the
tour
of
the
lakes
before
returning
and
was
gone
full
three
weeks
leaving
his
family
to
our
care
for
the
whole
time
heaven
be
praised
that
is
over
was
my
exclamation
when
i
saw
the
stage
move
off
that
bore
them
from
our
door
frost
at
length
came
and
with
it
expired
the
visiting
season
we
were
still
at
a
convenient
distance
from
the
city
but
our
friends
all
at
once
seemed
to
have
forgotten
us
you
are
not
going
to
move
back
now
said
a
friend
in
surprise
to
whom
i
mentioned
in
the
following
march
our
intention
to
return
to
the
city
yes
i
replied
just
as
spring
is
about
opening
why
surely
after
passing
the
dreary
winter
in
the
country
you
will
not
come
to
the
hot
and
dusty
town
to
spend
the
summer
you
are
at
such
a
convenient
distance
too
and
your
friends
can
visit
you
so
easily
yes
the
distance
was
convenient
and
we
had
learned
to
appreciate
that
advantage
but
back
to
the
city
we
removed
and
when
next
we
venture
to
the
country
will
take
good
care
to
get
beyond
a
convenient
distance
chapter
vii
the
dinner
it
was
washing
day
that
day
of
all
days
in
the
week
most
dreaded
by
housekeepers
we
had
a
poor
breakfast
of
course
cook
had
to
help
with
the
washing
and
as
washing
was
the
important
thing
for
the
day
every
thing
else
was
doomed
to
suffer
the
wash
kettle
was
to
her
of
greater
moment
than
the
tea
kettle
or
coffee
pot
and
the
boiling
of
wash
water
first
in
consideration
compared
with
broiling
the
steak
the
breakfast
bell
rung
nearly
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
as
i
entered
the
dining
room
i
saw
that
nearly
every
thing
was
in
disorder
and
that
the
table
was
little
over
half
set
scarcely
had
i
taken
my
seat
ere
the
bell
was
in
my
hand
there
no
sugar
on
the
table
kitty
these
were
my
words
as
the
girl
entered
in
obedience
to
my
summons
oh
i
forgot
she
ejaculated
and
hurriedly
supplied
the
deficiency
went
my
bell
ere
she
had
reached
the
kitchen
there
no
knife
and
fork
for
the
steak
said
i
as
kitty
the
knife
and
fork
were
furnished
but
not
with
a
very
amiable
grace
what
the
matter
with
this
coffee
asked
smith
after
sipping
a
spoonful
or
two
it
got
a
queer
taste
i
sure
i
do
know
it
was
plain
that
i
was
going
to
have
another
trying
day
and
i
began
to
feel
a
little
worried
my
reply
was
not
therefore
made
in
a
very
composed
voice
smith
continued
to
sip
his
coffee
with
a
spoon
and
to
taste
the
liquid
doubtingly
at
length
he
pushed
his
cup
from
him
saying
it
no
use
i
ca
drink
that
i
wish
you
would
just
taste
it
i
do
believe
kitty
has
dropped
a
piece
of
soap
into
the
coffee
pot
by
this
time
i
had
turned
out
a
cup
of
the
fluid
for
myself
and
proceeded
to
try
its
quality
it
certainly
had
a
queer
taste
but
as
to
the
substance
to
which
it
was
indebted
for
its
peculiar
flavor
i
was
in
total
ignorance
my
husband
insisted
that
it
was
soap
i
thought
differently
but
we
made
no
argument
on
the
subject
the
steak
was
found
on
trial
to
be
burned
so
badly
that
it
was
not
fit
to
be
eaten
and
my
husband
had
to
make
his
meal
of
bread
and
butter
and
cold
water
as
for
myself
this
spoiling
of
our
breakfast
for
no
good
reason
completely
destroyed
both
my
appetite
and
my
temper
you
better
get
your
dinner
at
an
eating
house
smith
said
i
as
he
arose
from
the
table
it
washing
day
and
we
shall
have
nothing
comfortable
things
will
be
no
more
comfortable
for
you
than
for
me
was
kindly
replied
by
my
husband
we
shall
only
have
a
dinner
said
i
i
like
a
good
dinner
answered
smith
there
is
something
so
out
of
the
ordinary
routine
of
ribs
loins
and
sirloins
something
so
comfortable
and
independent
about
it
no
you
can
not
eat
your
dinner
alone
drop
the
word
from
your
description
and
the
dinner
will
be
altogether
another
affair
said
i
no
do
come
home
if
you
please
for
every
thing
promises
to
be
most
uncomfortable
get
yourself
a
good
dinner
at
an
eating
house
and
leave
me
to
go
through
the
day
as
well
as
i
can
and
you
are
really
in
earnest
said
my
husband
seriously
i
certainly
am
was
my
reply
entirely
in
earnest
so
just
oblige
me
by
not
coming
home
to
dinner
smith
promised
and
there
was
so
much
off
of
my
mind
i
could
not
let
him
come
home
without
seeing
that
he
had
a
good
dinner
but
almost
any
thing
would
do
for
me
and
the
children
in
some
things
i
am
compelled
to
say
that
my
husband
is
a
little
uncertain
his
memory
is
not
always
to
be
depended
on
deeply
absorbed
in
business
as
he
was
at
that
time
he
frequently
let
things
of
minor
importance
pass
from
his
thoughts
altogether
so
it
happened
on
the
present
occasion
he
forgot
that
it
was
washing
day
and
that
he
had
promised
to
dine
down
town
punctually
at
one
he
left
his
place
of
business
as
usual
and
took
his
way
homeward
as
he
walked
along
he
met
an
old
friend
who
lived
in
a
neighboring
town
and
who
was
on
a
visit
to
our
city
why
jones
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
when
did
you
arrive
and
my
husband
grasped
the
hand
of
his
friend
eagerly
came
in
last
evening
replied
jones
how
well
you
look
smith
how
is
your
family
well
very
well
when
do
you
leave
by
this
afternoon
line
so
soon
you
make
no
stay
at
all
i
came
on
business
and
must
go
back
again
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
then
you
must
go
and
dine
with
me
jones
i
wo
take
no
for
an
answer
want
to
have
a
long
talk
with
you
about
old
times
thank
you
smith
replied
jones
but
as
i
do
happen
to
know
your
good
lady
i
hardly
feel
free
to
accept
your
invitation
do
hesitate
for
that
she
be
delighted
to
see
you
always
glad
to
meet
any
of
my
old
friends
so
come
along
i
a
dozen
things
to
say
to
you
i
really
afraid
of
intruding
on
your
wife
said
jones
still
holding
back
from
the
invitation
nonsense
answered
my
husband
my
friends
are
hers
she
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
i
talked
of
you
to
her
a
hundred
times
at
this
jones
yielded
i
ca
promise
you
any
thing
extra
said
smith
as
they
walked
along
nothing
more
than
a
good
plain
family
dinner
and
a
warm
welcome
all
i
could
ask
or
desire
returned
jones
it
was
a
few
minutes
to
two
the
bell
had
rung
for
dinner
and
i
was
just
rising
to
go
to
the
dining
room
when
i
heard
the
street
door
open
and
the
sound
of
my
husband
voice
in
the
passage
there
was
a
man
in
company
with
him
for
i
distinctly
heard
the
tread
of
a
pair
of
feet
what
could
this
mean
i
remained
seated
listening
with
attention
my
husband
entered
the
parlor
with
his
companion
talking
in
a
cheerful
animated
strain
and
i
heard
him
pull
up
the
blinds
and
throw
open
the
shutters
presently
he
came
tripping
lightly
up
the
stairs
to
my
sitting
room
i
brought
a
friend
home
to
dinner
jane
said
he
as
coolly
and
as
confidently
as
if
it
were
not
washing
day
and
as
if
he
had
not
told
me
on
going
out
that
he
would
dine
at
an
eating
house
this
was
a
little
too
much
for
my
patience
and
forbearance
are
you
beside
yourself
mr
smith
i
replied
my
face
instantly
becoming
flushed
and
my
eyes
glancing
out
upon
him
the
sudden
indignation
i
felt
at
such
treatment
why
jane
jane
this
is
not
kind
in
you
said
my
husband
with
regret
and
displeasure
in
his
voice
it
is
rather
hard
if
a
man
ca
ask
an
old
friend
home
to
dine
with
him
once
in
five
years
without
asking
the
special
permission
of
his
wife
smith
are
you
not
aware
that
this
is
washing
day
there
was
an
instant
change
in
my
husband
countenance
he
seemed
bewildered
for
a
few
moments
and
moreover
i
continued
are
you
not
aware
that
i
was
to
have
a
dinner
at
home
and
that
you
were
to
dine
at
an
eating
house
i
declare
smith
struck
his
hands
together
and
turned
around
once
upon
his
i
entirely
forgot
about
that
what
to
be
done
said
i
almost
crying
with
vexation
nothing
for
dinner
but
fried
ham
and
eggs
the
best
we
can
do
is
the
best
returned
smith
you
can
give
jones
a
hearty
welcome
and
that
will
compensate
for
any
defects
in
the
dinner
i
forewarned
him
that
we
should
not
entertain
him
very
sumptuously
you
better
tell
him
the
whole
truth
at
once
said
i
in
answer
to
this
and
then
take
him
to
an
eating
house
but
my
good
husband
would
hear
to
nothing
of
this
he
had
invited
his
old
friend
to
dine
with
him
and
dine
he
must
if
it
was
only
on
a
piece
of
dry
bread
pick
up
something
do
the
best
you
can
he
returned
we
can
wait
for
half
an
hour
i
nothing
in
the
house
i
tell
you
was
my
answer
made
in
no
very
pleasant
tones
for
i
felt
very
much
irritated
and
outraged
by
my
husband
thoughtless
conduct
there
there
jane
do
get
excited
about
the
matter
said
he
soothingly
but
his
words
were
not
like
oil
to
the
troubled
waters
of
my
spirit
i
am
excited
was
my
response
how
can
i
help
being
so
it
is
too
much
you
should
have
had
more
consideration
but
talking
was
of
no
use
jones
was
in
the
parlor
and
had
come
to
take
a
family
dinner
with
us
so
nothing
was
left
but
to
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
or
at
least
to
try
and
do
so
dinner
on
the
table
now
said
i
all
is
there
that
we
can
have
so
just
invite
your
friend
to
the
dining
room
where
you
will
find
me
so
saying
i
took
a
little
fellow
by
the
hand
who
always
eat
with
us
and
led
him
away
feeling
as
my
lady
readers
will
very
naturally
suppose
in
not
the
most
amiable
humor
in
the
world
i
had
just
got
the
child
who
was
pretty
hungry
seated
in
his
high
chair
when
my
husband
and
his
guest
made
their
appearance
and
i
was
introduced
sorry
am
i
to
chronicle
the
fact
but
truth
compels
me
to
make
a
faithful
record
that
my
reception
of
the
stranger
was
by
no
means
gracious
i
tried
to
smile
but
a
smile
was
such
a
mockery
of
my
real
feelings
that
every
facial
muscle
refused
to
play
the
hypocrite
the
man
was
not
welcome
and
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
conceal
this
a
plain
family
dinner
you
see
said
smith
as
we
took
our
places
at
the
meagre
board
we
are
plain
people
shall
i
help
you
to
some
of
the
ham
and
eggs
he
tried
to
smile
pleasantly
and
to
seem
very
much
at
his
ease
but
the
attempt
was
far
from
successful
i
want
some
do
give
him
all
screamed
out
the
hungry
child
at
my
side
stretching
out
his
hands
towards
the
poorly
supplied
dish
from
which
my
husband
was
about
supplying
our
guest
my
face
which
was
red
enough
before
now
became
like
scarlet
a
moment
longer
i
remained
at
the
table
and
then
rising
up
quickly
took
the
impatient
child
in
my
arms
and
carried
him
screaming
from
the
room
i
did
not
return
to
grace
the
dinner
table
with
my
unattractive
presence
of
what
passed
particularly
between
my
husband
and
his
friend
jones
who
had
left
his
luxurious
dinner
at
the
hotel
to
enjoy
a
plain
family
dinner
with
his
old
acquaintance
i
never
ventured
to
make
enquiry
they
did
not
remain
very
long
at
the
table
nor
very
long
in
the
house
after
finishing
their
frugal
meal
i
have
heard
since
that
jones
has
expressed
commiseration
for
my
husband
as
the
married
partner
of
a
real
termigant
i
do
much
wonder
at
his
indifferent
opinion
for
i
rather
think
i
must
have
shown
in
my
face
something
of
the
indignant
fire
that
was
in
me
smith
who
was
too
much
in
the
habit
of
inviting
people
home
to
take
a
family
dinner
with
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
has
never
committed
that
error
since
his
mortification
was
too
severe
to
be
easily
forgotten
chapter
viii
who
is
kriss
kringle
it
was
the
day
before
christmas
always
a
day
of
restless
hopeful
excitement
among
the
children
and
my
thoughts
were
busy
as
is
usual
at
this
season
with
little
plans
for
increasing
the
gladness
of
my
happy
household
the
name
of
the
good
genius
who
presides
over
toys
and
sugar
plums
was
often
on
my
lips
but
oftener
on
the
lips
of
the
children
who
is
kriss
kringle
mamma
asked
a
pair
of
rosy
lips
close
to
my
ear
as
i
stood
at
the
kitchen
table
rolling
out
and
cutting
cakes
i
turned
at
the
question
and
met
the
earnest
gaze
of
a
couple
of
bright
eyes
the
roguish
owner
of
which
had
climbed
into
a
chair
for
the
purpose
of
taking
note
of
my
doings
i
kissed
the
sweet
lips
but
did
not
answer
say
mamma
who
is
kriss
kringle
persevered
the
little
one
why
do
you
know
said
i
smiling
no
mamma
who
is
he
why
he
is
he
is
kriss
kringle
oh
mamma
say
wo
you
tell
me
ask
papa
when
he
comes
home
i
returned
evasively
i
never
like
deceiving
children
in
any
thing
and
yet
christmas
after
christmas
i
have
imposed
on
them
the
pleasant
fiction
of
kriss
kringle
without
suffering
very
severe
pangs
of
conscience
dear
little
creatures
how
fully
they
believed
at
first
the
story
how
soberly
and
confidingly
they
hung
their
stockings
in
the
chimney
corner
with
what
faith
and
joy
did
they
receive
their
many
gifts
on
the
christmas
morning
yes
it
is
a
pleasant
fiction
and
if
there
be
in
it
a
leaven
of
wrong
it
is
indeed
a
small
portion
but
why
wo
you
tell
me
mamma
persisted
my
little
interrogator
do
you
know
kriss
kringle
i
never
saw
him
dear
said
i
has
papa
seen
him
ask
him
when
he
comes
home
i
wish
krissy
would
bring
me
oh
such
an
elegant
carriage
and
four
horses
with
a
driver
that
could
get
down
and
go
up
again
if
i
see
him
i
tell
him
to
bring
you
just
such
a
nice
carriage
and
will
he
do
it
mamma
the
dear
child
clapped
his
hands
together
with
delight
i
guess
so
i
wish
i
could
see
him
he
said
more
soberly
and
thoughtfully
and
then
as
if
some
new
impression
had
crossed
his
mind
he
hastened
down
from
the
chair
and
went
gliding
from
the
room
half
an
hour
afterwards
as
i
came
into
the
nursery
i
saw
my
three
olive
branches
clustered
together
in
a
corner
holding
grave
counsel
on
some
subject
of
importance
at
least
to
themselves
they
became
silent
at
my
presence
but
soon
began
to
talk
aloud
i
listened
to
a
few
words
but
perceived
nothing
of
particular
concern
then
turned
my
thoughts
away
who
is
kriss
kringle
papa
i
heard
my
boy
asking
of
smith
soon
after
he
came
home
in
the
evening
the
answer
i
did
not
hear
enough
that
the
enquirer
did
not
appear
satisfied
therewith
at
the
children
were
not
in
very
good
appetite
though
in
fine
spirits
as
soon
as
the
evening
meal
was
over
smith
went
out
to
buy
presents
for
our
little
ones
while
i
took
upon
myself
the
task
of
getting
them
off
early
to
bed
a
christmas
tree
had
been
obtained
during
the
day
and
it
stood
in
one
of
the
parlors
on
a
table
into
this
parlor
the
good
genius
was
to
descend
during
the
night
and
hang
on
the
branches
of
the
tree
or
leave
upon
the
table
his
gifts
for
the
children
this
was
our
arrangement
the
little
ones
expressed
some
doubts
as
to
whether
kriss
kringle
would
come
to
this
particular
room
and
little
cherry
lips
could
just
see
how
the
genius
was
going
to
get
down
the
chimney
when
the
was
closed
up
never
mind
love
kriss
will
find
his
way
here
was
my
answer
to
all
objections
but
how
do
you
know
mother
have
you
sent
him
word
oh
i
know
thus
i
put
aside
their
enquiries
and
hurried
them
off
to
bed
now
go
to
sleep
right
quickly
said
i
after
they
were
snugly
under
their
warm
blankets
and
comforts
and
morning
be
up
bright
and
early
and
so
i
left
them
to
their
peaceful
slumbers
an
hour
it
was
or
more
ere
smith
returned
with
his
pockets
well
laden
i
was
in
the
parlor
where
we
had
placed
the
christmas
tree
engaged
in
decorating
it
with
rosettes
sugar
toys
and
the
like
at
this
work
i
had
been
some
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
and
had
i
will
own
become
a
little
nervous
my
domestic
had
gone
out
and
i
was
alone
in
the
house
once
or
twice
as
i
sat
in
the
silent
room
i
imagined
that
i
heard
a
movement
in
the
one
adjoining
and
several
times
i
was
sure
that
my
ear
detected
something
like
the
smothered
breathing
of
a
man
all
imagination
said
i
to
myself
but
again
and
again
the
same
sounds
stirred
upon
the
silent
air
could
there
be
a
robber
concealed
in
the
next
room
the
thought
made
me
shudder
i
was
afraid
to
move
from
where
i
sat
what
a
relief
when
i
heard
my
husband
key
in
the
door
followed
by
the
sound
of
his
well
known
tread
in
the
passage
my
fears
vanished
in
a
moment
as
smith
stood
near
me
in
the
act
of
unloading
his
pockets
he
bent
close
to
my
ear
and
whispered
will
is
under
the
table
i
caught
a
glance
of
his
bright
eyes
just
now
what
it
true
and
the
other
little
rogues
are
in
the
next
room
peeping
through
the
door
at
this
very
moment
i
was
silent
with
surprise
they
determined
to
know
who
kriss
kringle
is
added
my
husband
then
speaking
aloud
he
said
come
dear
i
want
to
show
you
something
up
in
the
i
understood
smith
and
arose
up
instantly
not
so
much
as
glancing
towards
the
partly
opened
folding
door
we
were
hardly
in
the
dining
room
before
we
heard
the
light
pattering
of
feet
and
low
smothered
tittering
on
the
stairway
then
all
was
still
and
we
descended
to
the
parlors
again
quite
as
much
pleased
with
what
had
occurred
as
the
little
rogues
were
themselves
i
declare
really
i
thought
them
all
sound
asleep
an
hour
ago
said
i
on
resuming
my
work
of
decorating
the
christmas
tree
who
could
have
believed
them
cunning
enough
for
this
it
all
doings
he
get
through
the
world
aye
will
he
returned
smith
oh
if
you
could
have
seen
his
face
as
i
saw
it
just
peering
from
under
the
table
cloth
his
eyes
as
bright
as
stars
and
full
of
merriment
and
delight
bless
his
heart
he
a
dear
little
fellow
how
could
i
help
saying
this
and
the
others
you
lost
half
the
pleasure
of
the
whole
affair
by
not
seeing
them
we
shall
have
a
frolic
with
the
rogues
morning
i
can
see
the
triumph
on
will
face
i
understand
now
what
all
their
whisperings
meant
this
afternoon
they
were
concocting
this
plan
i
could
have
believed
it
of
them
children
are
curious
bodies
said
smith
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
in
the
next
room
i
remarked
while
you
were
out
and
became
really
nervous
for
a
while
i
heard
the
breathing
of
some
one
near
me
also
but
tried
to
argue
myself
into
the
belief
that
it
was
only
imagination
thus
we
conned
over
the
little
incident
while
we
arranged
the
children
toys
i
know
who
kriss
kringle
is
i
know
was
the
triumphant
affirmation
of
one
and
another
of
the
children
as
we
gathered
at
the
breakfast
table
next
morning
do
you
indeed
said
i
trying
to
look
grave
yes
it
is
papa
papa
kriss
kringle
how
can
that
be
oh
we
know
we
found
out
indeed
and
we
made
of
course
a
great
wonder
of
this
assertion
the
merry
elves
what
a
happy
christmas
it
was
for
them
ever
since
they
have
dated
from
the
time
when
they
found
out
who
kriss
kringle
was
it
is
all
to
no
purpose
that
we
pleasantly
suggest
the
possibility
of
their
having
dreamed
of
what
they
allege
to
have
occurred
under
their
actual
vision
they
have
recorded
it
in
their
memories
and
refer
to
it
as
a
veritable
fact
dear
children
how
little
they
really
ask
of
us
to
make
them
happy
did
we
give
them
but
a
twentieth
part
of
the
time
we
devote
to
business
care
and
pleasure
how
greatly
would
we
promote
their
good
and
increase
the
measure
of
their
enjoyment
not
alone
at
christmas
time
but
all
the
year
should
we
remember
and
care
for
their
pleasures
for
the
state
of
innocent
pleasure
in
children
is
one
in
which
good
affections
are
implanted
and
these
take
root
and
grow
and
produce
fruit
in
after
life
chapter
ix
not
at
home
never
but
once
did
i
venture
upon
the
utterance
of
that
little
white
lie
not
at
home
and
then
i
was
well
punished
for
my
weakness
and
folly
it
occurred
at
a
time
when
there
were
in
my
family
two
new
inmates
a
niece
from
new
york
and
a
raw
irish
girl
that
i
had
taken
a
few
days
before
on
trial
my
niece
agnes
was
a
young
lady
in
her
nineteenth
year
the
daughter
of
my
brother
i
had
not
seen
her
before
since
her
days
and
knew
little
of
her
character
her
mother
i
had
always
esteemed
as
a
woman
i
was
much
pleased
to
have
a
visit
from
agnes
and
felt
drawn
toward
her
more
and
more
every
day
there
was
something
pure
and
good
about
her
now
aggy
dear
said
i
to
her
one
morning
after
breakfast
as
we
took
our
work
and
retired
from
the
to
one
of
the
parlors
where
i
was
occasionally
in
the
habit
of
sitting
we
must
sew
for
dear
life
until
dinner
time
so
as
to
finish
these
two
frocks
for
the
children
to
wear
this
evening
it
is
right
i
know
to
impose
on
you
in
this
way
but
you
sew
so
quick
and
neatly
and
then
it
will
help
me
through
and
leave
me
free
to
visit
girard
college
with
you
this
afternoon
do
speak
of
it
aunt
returned
i
never
happier
than
when
employed
and
besides
it
only
fair
that
i
should
sew
for
you
in
the
morning
if
you
are
to
go
pleasuring
with
me
in
the
afternoon
lightly
the
hours
flew
by
passed
in
cheerful
conversation
i
found
that
the
mind
of
my
niece
had
been
highly
cultivated
that
her
tastes
were
refined
and
her
moral
sense
acute
to
say
that
i
was
pleased
with
her
would
but
half
express
what
i
felt
there
was
to
be
a
juvenile
party
at
the
house
of
one
of
our
acquaintances
that
evening
to
which
the
children
were
invited
and
we
were
at
work
in
preparing
dresses
and
other
matters
suitable
for
them
to
appear
in
twelve
came
very
quickly
too
quickly
for
me
in
fact
for
i
had
not
accomplished
near
so
much
as
i
had
hoped
to
do
it
would
require
the
most
diligent
application
through
every
moment
of
time
that
intervened
until
the
dinner
hour
for
us
to
get
through
with
what
we
were
doing
so
as
to
have
the
afternoon
to
ourselves
for
the
intended
excursion
as
the
clock
rung
out
the
hour
of
noon
i
exclaimed
is
it
possible
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
so
late
how
slowly
i
do
seem
to
get
along
just
at
this
moment
the
bell
rung
bless
me
i
hope
we
are
not
to
have
visitors
this
morning
said
i
as
i
let
my
hands
fall
in
my
lap
i
thought
hurriedly
for
a
moment
and
then
remarked
in
a
decided
way
of
course
we
can
not
see
any
one
we
are
engaged
by
this
time
i
heard
the
footsteps
of
mary
on
her
way
from
the
kitchen
and
i
very
naturally
passed
quickly
to
the
parlor
door
to
intercept
and
give
her
my
instructions
say
that
i
engaged
was
on
my
tongue
but
somehow
or
other
i
had
not
the
courage
to
give
these
words
utterance
the
visitor
might
be
a
person
to
whom
such
an
excuse
for
not
appearing
would
seem
unkind
or
be
an
offence
in
this
uncertain
state
my
mind
fell
into
confusion
mary
was
before
me
and
awaiting
the
direction
she
saw
that
i
was
about
giving
say
that
i
not
at
home
if
any
one
asks
to
see
me
came
in
a
sudden
impulse
from
my
lips
and
then
my
cheeks
flushed
to
think
that
i
had
instructed
my
servant
to
give
utterance
to
a
falsehood
yes
mim
answered
the
girl
glancing
into
my
face
with
a
knowing
leer
that
produced
an
instant
sense
of
humiliation
and
away
she
went
to
do
my
bidding
i
did
not
glance
towards
agnes
as
i
returned
to
my
seat
and
took
up
my
work
i
had
not
the
courage
to
do
this
that
i
had
lowered
myself
in
her
estimation
i
felt
certain
i
heard
the
street
door
open
and
bent
involuntarily
in
a
listening
attitude
the
voice
of
a
lady
uttered
my
name
she
not
at
home
mim
came
distinctly
on
my
ears
causing
the
flush
on
my
cheeks
to
become
still
deeper
a
murmur
of
voices
followed
then
i
heard
the
closing
of
the
vestibule
door
and
mary
returning
to
the
back
parlor
where
we
were
sitting
who
was
it
mary
i
enquired
as
the
girl
entered
now
what
was
it
sure
and
i
forgotten
their
names
intirely
but
lack
of
memory
did
not
long
keep
me
in
ignorance
as
to
who
were
my
visitors
for
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
they
had
bethought
themselves
of
some
message
they
wished
to
leave
and
the
vestibule
door
left
by
mary
followed
her
along
the
passage
to
the
room
they
saw
her
enter
as
they
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
parlor
mary
heard
them
and
turning
quickly
exclaimed
in
consternation
och
murther
a
moment
she
stood
confronting
in
no
very
graceful
attitude
a
couple
of
ladies
and
then
escaped
to
the
kitchen
here
was
a
scene
of
embarrassment
not
among
all
my
acquaintances
were
there
perhaps
two
persons
whom
i
would
have
least
desired
to
witness
in
me
such
a
fault
as
the
one
of
which
i
had
been
guilty
for
a
little
while
i
knew
not
what
to
say
i
sat
overcome
with
mortification
at
length
i
arose
and
said
with
an
effort
walk
in
ladies
how
are
you
this
morning
i
pleased
to
see
you
take
chairs
my
niece
williams
and
glenn
i
hope
you
will
excuse
us
we
were
oh
no
apologies
smith
returned
one
of
the
ladies
with
a
quiet
smile
and
an
air
of
pardon
this
intrusion
we
understood
the
servant
that
you
were
not
at
home
engaged
she
meant
said
i
a
deeper
crimson
suffusing
my
face
the
fact
is
we
are
working
for
dear
life
to
get
the
children
ready
for
a
party
and
wished
to
be
excused
from
seeing
any
one
certainly
all
right
returned
williams
i
merely
came
in
to
say
to
your
domestic
i
had
forgotten
it
at
the
door
that
my
sister
expected
to
leave
for
her
home
in
new
york
in
a
day
or
two
and
would
call
here
with
me
afternoon
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
her
said
i
very
happy
do
come
in
and
sit
down
for
a
little
while
if
i
had
only
known
it
was
you
now
that
last
sentence
spoken
in
embarrassment
and
mental
confusion
was
only
making
matters
worse
it
placed
me
in
a
false
and
despicable
light
before
my
visitors
for
in
it
was
the
savor
of
hypocrisy
which
is
foreign
to
my
nature
no
thank
you
replied
my
visitors
good
morning
and
they
retired
leaving
me
so
overcome
with
shame
mortification
confusion
and
distress
that
i
burst
into
tears
to
think
that
i
should
have
done
such
a
thing
was
my
first
remark
so
soon
as
i
had
a
little
recovered
my
and
i
looked
up
half
timidly
into
the
face
of
my
niece
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
expression
of
surprise
and
pain
that
was
in
her
fair
young
countenance
i
had
uttered
a
falsehood
in
her
presence
and
thus
done
violence
to
the
good
opinion
she
had
formed
of
me
the
beautiful
ideal
of
her
aunt
which
had
filled
her
mind
was
blurred
over
and
her
heart
was
sad
in
consequence
dear
aggy
said
i
throwing
my
work
upon
the
floor
and
bending
earnestly
towards
do
think
too
meanly
of
me
for
this
little
circumstance
i
never
was
guilty
of
that
thing
before
never
and
well
have
i
been
punished
for
my
thoughtless
folly
i
spoke
from
impulse
and
not
reflection
when
i
told
mary
to
say
that
i
was
not
at
home
and
repented
of
what
i
had
done
almost
as
soon
as
the
words
passed
my
lips
agnes
looked
at
me
for
some
moments
until
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
then
she
said
in
a
low
sweet
earnest
voice
mother
always
says
if
she
can
not
see
any
one
who
calls
that
she
is
engaged
and
so
do
i
dear
i
returned
this
is
my
first
offence
against
truth
and
you
may
be
sure
that
it
will
be
the
last
and
it
was
my
last
when
next
i
met
williams
and
glenn
there
was
in
both
of
them
a
reserve
not
seen
before
i
felt
this
change
keenly
i
had
wronged
myself
in
their
good
opinion
and
could
not
venture
upon
an
explanation
of
my
conduct
for
that
i
felt
might
only
make
matters
worse
how
often
since
has
my
cheek
burned
as
a
vivid
recollection
came
up
before
my
mind
of
what
occurred
on
that
morning
i
can
never
forget
it
chapter
x
shirt
buttons
in
a
previous
chapter
i
gave
the
reader
one
of
the
experiences
of
my
sister
husband
john
jones
i
now
give
another
there
was
a
time
in
my
married
life
thus
jones
writes
in
one
of
confessions
when
i
was
less
annoyed
if
my
bosom
or
wristband
happened
to
be
minus
a
button
than
i
am
at
present
but
continual
dropping
will
wear
away
a
stone
and
the
ever
recurring
buttonless
collar
or
wristband
will
wear
out
a
man
patience
be
he
naturally
as
enduring
as
the
man
of
uz
i
do
mean
by
this
that
jones
is
a
neglectful
woman
oh
no
do
let
that
be
imagined
for
a
moment
jones
is
a
woman
who
has
an
eye
for
shirt
buttons
and
when
that
is
said
a
volume
is
told
in
a
few
words
but
i
do
care
how
careful
a
wife
is
nor
how
good
an
eye
she
may
have
for
shirt
buttons
there
will
come
a
time
when
from
some
cause
or
other
she
will
momentarily
abate
her
vigilance
and
that
will
be
the
very
time
when
betty
or
has
been
at
work
upon
the
buttons
for
a
year
or
two
after
our
marriage
i
used
to
express
impatience
whenever
in
putting
on
a
clean
shirt
i
found
a
button
gone
jones
bore
this
for
a
while
without
exhibiting
much
feeling
but
it
fretted
her
more
than
she
permitted
any
one
to
see
at
length
the
constant
recurrence
of
the
evil
i
did
know
as
much
then
as
i
do
now
annoyed
me
so
that
i
passed
from
ejaculatory
expressions
of
impatience
into
more
decided
and
emphatic
disapprobation
and
to
psha
and
there
it
is
again
and
the
like
were
added
i
declare
jones
this
is
too
bad
or
i
given
up
hoping
for
a
shirt
with
a
full
complement
of
buttons
or
if
you
ca
sew
the
buttons
on
my
shirt
jones
i
will
hire
some
one
to
do
it
this
last
expression
of
displeasure
i
never
ventured
upon
but
once
i
have
always
felt
ashamed
of
it
since
whenever
a
recollection
of
my
unreasonableness
and
impatience
in
the
early
times
of
the
shirt
button
trouble
has
crossed
my
mind
my
wife
took
it
so
much
to
heart
and
so
earnestly
avowed
her
constant
solicitude
in
regard
to
the
shirt
buttons
that
i
resolved
from
that
time
to
bear
the
evil
like
a
man
and
instead
of
grumbling
or
complaining
make
known
the
fact
of
a
deficiency
whenever
it
occurred
as
a
good
joke
and
so
for
a
year
or
so
it
used
to
be
when
the
buttons
were
missing
buttons
again
jones
or
d
see
that
or
here
the
old
story
always
said
laughingly
and
varied
as
to
the
mood
or
fertility
of
fancy
but
on
so
grave
a
subject
as
shirt
buttons
jones
had
no
heart
for
a
joke
the
fact
that
her
vigilance
had
proved
all
in
vain
and
that
spite
of
constant
care
a
shirt
had
found
its
way
into
my
drawer
lacking
its
full
complement
of
buttons
was
something
too
serious
for
a
smile
or
a
jest
and
my
words
no
matter
how
lightly
spoken
would
be
felt
as
a
reproof
any
allusion
therefore
to
shirt
buttons
was
sure
to
produce
a
cloud
upon
the
otherwise
calm
brow
of
jones
it
was
a
sore
subject
and
could
not
be
touched
even
by
the
light
end
of
a
feather
without
producing
pain
what
was
i
to
do
put
off
with
the
lack
of
a
shirt
button
uncomplainingly
pin
my
collar
if
the
little
circular
piece
of
bone
or
ivory
were
gone
and
not
hint
at
the
omission
yes
i
resolved
not
to
say
a
word
more
about
shirt
buttons
but
to
bear
the
evil
whenever
it
occurred
with
the
patience
of
a
martyr
many
days
had
not
passed
after
this
resolution
was
taken
before
on
changing
my
linen
one
morning
i
found
that
there
was
a
button
less
than
the
usual
number
on
the
bosom
of
my
shirt
jones
had
been
up
on
the
evening
before
half
an
hour
after
i
was
in
bed
looking
over
my
shirts
to
see
if
every
thing
was
in
order
but
even
her
sharp
eyes
had
failed
to
discover
the
place
left
vacant
by
a
deserting
member
of
the
shirt
button
fraternity
i
knew
she
had
done
her
best
and
i
pitied
rather
than
blamed
her
for
i
was
sensible
that
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
which
had
just
come
to
light
would
trouble
her
a
thousand
times
more
than
it
did
me
the
breakfast
hour
passed
without
a
discovery
by
jones
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
button
off
of
the
bosom
of
my
shirt
but
when
i
came
in
at
dinner
time
her
first
words
looking
at
me
were
why
jones
there
a
button
off
your
bosom
i
know
said
i
indifferently
it
was
off
when
i
put
the
shirt
on
this
morning
but
it
makes
no
difference
you
can
sew
it
on
when
the
shirt
next
comes
from
the
i
was
really
sincere
in
what
i
said
and
took
some
merit
to
myself
for
being
as
composed
as
i
was
on
so
agitating
subject
judge
of
my
surprise
then
to
hear
jones
exclaim
with
a
flushed
face
indeed
jones
this
is
too
much
no
difference
indeed
a
nice
opinion
people
must
have
had
of
your
wife
to
see
you
going
about
with
your
bosom
all
gaping
open
in
that
style
nobody
noticed
it
said
i
in
reply
do
you
see
that
the
edges
lie
perfectly
smooth
together
as
much
so
as
if
held
by
a
button
but
it
was
no
use
to
say
anything
jones
was
hurt
at
my
not
speaking
of
the
button
i
sure
she
said
that
i
am
always
ready
to
do
anything
for
you
i
never
complain
about
sewing
on
your
buttons
nonsense
jones
do
take
it
so
much
to
heart
i
replied
here
get
your
needle
and
thread
and
you
can
have
it
all
right
in
a
minute
it
but
a
trifle
i
sure
i
hav
thought
about
it
since
i
put
on
the
shirt
this
morning
but
all
would
not
do
jones
grief
was
too
real
and
when
i
losing
to
some
extent
my
patience
said
fretfully
i
wish
somebody
would
invent
a
shirt
without
buttons
she
sighed
deeply
and
in
a
little
while
i
saw
her
handkerchief
go
quietly
to
her
eyes
again
and
again
i
tried
the
plane
but
it
worked
worse
if
any
thing
than
the
other
for
jones
was
sure
to
find
out
the
truth
and
then
she
would
be
dreadfully
hurt
about
my
omission
to
speak
and
so
the
years
have
passed
sometimes
i
fret
a
little
when
i
find
a
shirt
button
off
sometimes
i
ask
mildly
to
have
the
omission
supplied
when
i
discover
its
existence
sometimes
i
jest
about
it
and
sometimes
i
bear
the
evil
in
silence
but
the
effects
produced
upon
jones
are
about
the
same
her
equanimity
of
mind
is
disturbed
and
she
will
look
unhappy
for
hours
never
but
once
have
i
complained
without
a
cause
but
that
one
instance
gave
jones
a
triumph
which
has
done
much
to
sustain
her
in
all
her
subsequent
trials
we
had
some
friends
staying
with
us
and
among
the
various
matters
of
discussion
that
came
up
during
the
social
evenings
we
spent
together
shirt
buttons
were
on
one
occasion
conspicuous
to
record
all
that
was
said
about
them
would
fill
pages
and
i
will
not
therefore
attempt
even
a
brief
record
of
all
the
allegations
brought
against
the
useful
little
shirt
button
the
final
decision
was
that
it
must
be
the
apple
of
discord
in
disguise
a
button
off
as
usual
i
muttered
to
myself
the
next
morning
as
i
put
on
a
clean
shirt
jones
had
risen
half
an
hour
before
me
and
was
down
stairs
giving
some
directions
about
breakfast
so
that
i
could
not
ask
to
have
it
sewed
on
and
after
leaving
my
room
i
thought
it
as
well
not
to
say
any
thing
about
it
in
due
time
we
gathered
with
our
friends
around
the
breakfast
table
a
sight
of
them
reminded
me
of
the
conversation
the
previous
evening
and
i
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
allude
to
the
missing
shirt
button
as
quite
an
apropos
and
amusing
incident
so
speaking
from
the
impulse
of
the
moment
i
said
glancing
first
at
jones
then
around
the
table
and
then
pointing
down
at
my
bosom
the
old
story
of
shirt
buttons
again
instantly
the
color
mounted
to
the
cheeks
and
brow
of
jones
then
the
color
as
quickly
melted
away
and
a
look
of
triumph
passed
over
her
face
she
pushed
back
her
chair
quickly
and
rising
up
came
round
to
where
i
sat
took
hold
of
the
button
i
had
failed
to
see
and
holding
it
between
her
fingers
said
oh
yes
this
the
old
story
mr
jones
i
drew
down
my
chin
so
as
to
get
a
low
angle
of
vision
and
sure
enough
the
button
was
there
a
burst
of
laughter
went
around
the
table
in
which
jones
most
heartily
joined
and
i
laughed
too
as
glad
as
she
was
that
the
joke
was
all
on
her
side
i
have
never
you
may
be
sure
heard
the
last
of
this
but
it
was
a
lucky
incident
for
it
has
given
jones
something
to
fall
back
upon
and
have
her
jest
occasionally
whenever
i
happen
to
discover
that
a
button
is
among
the
missing
and
that
she
can
even
at
times
find
it
in
her
heart
to
jest
on
such
a
subject
is
i
can
assure
you
a
great
gain
so
much
for
shirt
buttons
i
could
say
a
great
deal
more
for
the
subject
is
inexhaustible
but
i
will
forbear
chapter
xi
pavement
washing
in
winter
two
weeks
of
weather
in
and
then
the
thermometer
went
hurrying
down
towards
zero
with
alarming
rapidity
evening
closed
in
with
a
temperature
so
mild
that
fires
were
permitted
to
expire
in
the
ashes
and
morning
broke
with
a
cold
whistling
through
every
crack
and
cranny
in
a
tone
that
made
you
shrink
and
shiver
winter
at
last
said
i
creeping
forth
from
my
warm
bed
with
a
very
natural
feeling
of
reluctance
time
was
the
half
asleep
and
half
awake
response
of
smith
as
he
drew
the
clothes
about
his
shoulders
and
turned
himself
over
for
the
enjoyment
of
his
usual
half
hour
morning
nap
it
was
saturday
that
busiest
day
in
the
seven
at
least
for
housekeepers
and
as
late
as
half
past
seven
yet
the
house
felt
as
cold
as
a
barn
i
stepped
to
the
register
to
ascertain
if
the
fire
had
been
made
in
the
heater
against
my
hand
came
a
pressure
of
air
cold
air
too
bad
i
murmured
fretfully
that
girl
has
never
touched
the
fire
so
i
gave
the
bell
a
pretty
vigorous
jerk
in
a
few
minutes
up
came
nancy
the
cook
in
answer
to
my
summons
why
has
biddy
made
the
fire
in
the
heater
i
asked
she
has
made
it
mum
there
is
a
particle
of
heat
coming
up
i
heard
her
at
work
down
there
i
guess
she
made
it
up
but
it
has
began
to
burn
good
yet
tell
her
that
i
want
her
she
washing
the
pavement
mum
washing
the
pavement
yes
mum
what
possessed
her
to
wash
the
pavement
on
a
day
like
this
it
the
right
day
mum
it
saturday
saturday
do
she
know
that
the
water
will
freeze
almost
as
soon
as
it
touches
the
ground
go
and
tell
her
to
come
in
this
minute
and
not
throw
another
drop
on
the
pavement
nancy
withdrew
and
i
kept
on
speaking
to
myself
i
never
saw
such
creatures
no
consideration
in
them
washing
the
pavement
on
a
morning
like
this
little
do
they
care
who
falls
on
the
ice
or
who
has
a
broken
arm
or
a
broken
leg
just
as
i
had
said
this
i
heard
a
crash
and
an
exclamation
without
and
hurrying
to
the
window
looked
forth
biddy
work
was
done
and
well
done
for
the
pavement
was
one
sheet
of
ice
as
hard
and
smooth
as
glass
and
as
slippery
as
oil
prostrate
thereon
was
a
grocer
boy
and
just
beyond
the
curb
stone
in
the
gutter
lay
the
fragments
of
a
jug
of
molasses
stepping
back
quickly
to
where
the
bell
rope
hung
against
the
wall
i
gave
it
a
most
determined
jerk
scarcely
had
i
done
this
ere
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
which
was
used
as
a
nursery
opened
and
biddy
appeared
therein
why
biddy
i
exclaimed
what
possessed
you
to
throw
water
on
the
pavement
this
morning
faix
and
how
was
i
to
get
it
clane
mim
widout
wather
coolly
returned
biddy
clean
yes
mim
clane
there
was
no
crying
necessity
to
have
it
clean
did
you
see
it
sathurday
mim
interrupted
biddy
in
a
voice
that
showed
the
argument
in
her
mind
to
be
unanswerable
we
always
wash
the
pavement
on
sathurday
but
it
does
do
to
wash
the
pavement
i
returned
now
trying
to
put
a
little
reason
into
her
head
when
it
is
so
cold
that
water
will
freeze
as
soon
as
it
touches
the
ground
the
bricks
become
as
slippery
as
glass
and
people
ca
walk
on
them
without
falling
och
and
what
hev
we
till
do
wid
the
paple
lot
look
their
steps
but
biddy
that
wo
do
people
do
expect
to
find
pavements
like
glass
and
they
slip
often
while
unaware
of
danger
just
at
this
moment
a
poor
lad
fell
and
broke
his
jug
all
to
pieces
did
he
and
less
the
pity
for
him
why
he
walk
along
like
an
orderly
dacent
body
why
did
he
look
his
steps
biddy
said
i
seeing
that
it
was
useless
to
hold
an
argument
with
her
do
you
go
this
minute
and
throw
ashes
all
over
the
pavement
ashes
on
the
clane
pavement
mrs
smith
yes
biddy
and
do
it
at
once
there
somebody
else
has
fallen
i
sprung
to
the
window
in
time
to
see
a
woman
on
the
pavement
and
the
contents
of
her
basket
of
marketing
scattered
all
around
her
go
this
minute
and
throw
ashes
over
the
pavement
i
called
to
biddy
in
a
voice
of
command
the
girl
left
the
room
with
evident
reluctance
the
idea
of
scattering
ashes
over
her
clean
pavement
was
to
her
no
very
pleasant
one
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
sat
looking
down
from
my
windows
upon
the
slippery
flags
and
noted
the
difficulty
which
pedestrians
had
to
cross
them
safely
that
biddy
would
never
appear
with
her
pan
of
ashes
why
do
the
girl
do
as
i
directed
had
just
passed
in
an
impatient
tone
from
my
lips
when
two
well
dressed
men
came
in
view
one
at
each
extremity
of
the
sheet
of
ice
they
were
approaching
and
stepped
with
evident
unconsciousness
of
danger
upon
the
treacherous
surface
i
had
a
kind
of
presentiment
that
one
or
both
would
fall
and
my
instinct
was
not
at
fault
suddenly
the
heels
of
one
flew
up
and
he
struck
the
pavement
with
a
concussion
that
sprung
his
hat
from
his
head
and
sent
it
some
feet
in
the
air
in
his
efforts
to
recover
himself
his
legs
became
entangled
in
those
of
the
other
and
over
he
went
backwards
his
head
striking
the
ground
with
a
terrible
shock
i
started
from
the
window
feeling
for
an
instant
faint
and
sick
in
a
few
moments
i
returned
and
looked
out
again
both
the
fallen
ones
had
regained
their
feet
and
passed
out
of
sight
and
biddy
who
had
witnessed
the
last
scene
in
this
half
comic
half
tragic
performance
was
giving
the
pavement
a
plentiful
coating
of
ashes
and
cinders
i
may
be
permitted
to
remark
that
i
trust
other
housekeepers
whose
pavements
are
washed
on
cold
mornings
and
their
name
i
had
almost
said
is
legion
are
as
innocent
as
i
was
in
the
above
case
and
that
the
wrong
to
pedestrians
lies
at
the
door
of
thoughtless
servants
but
is
it
not
our
duty
to
see
the
wrong
has
no
further
repetition
it
has
been
remarked
that
the
residence
of
a
truly
humane
man
may
be
known
by
the
ashes
before
his
door
on
a
slippery
morning
if
this
be
so
what
are
we
to
think
of
those
who
coolly
supply
a
sheet
of
ice
to
the
side
walk
chapter
xii
regard
for
the
poor
we
sometimes
get
by
chance
as
it
were
glimpses
of
life
altogether
new
yet
full
of
instruction
i
once
had
such
a
glimpse
and
at
the
time
put
it
upon
record
as
a
lesson
for
myself
as
well
as
others
its
introduction
into
this
series
of
confessions
will
be
quite
in
place
how
many
children
have
you
i
asked
of
a
poor
woman
one
day
who
with
her
tray
of
fish
on
her
head
stopped
at
my
door
with
the
hope
of
finding
a
customer
four
she
replied
all
young
yes
the
oldest
is
but
seven
years
of
age
have
you
a
husband
i
enquired
the
woman
replied
in
a
changed
voice
yes
but
he
is
much
help
to
me
like
a
great
many
other
men
he
drinks
too
much
if
it
was
for
that
you
would
find
me
crying
fish
about
the
streets
in
the
spring
and
berries
through
the
summer
to
get
bread
for
my
children
he
could
support
us
all
comfortably
if
he
was
only
sober
for
he
has
a
good
trade
and
is
a
good
workman
he
used
to
earn
ten
and
sometimes
twelve
dollars
a
week
how
much
do
you
make
towards
supporting
your
family
i
asked
nearly
all
they
get
to
live
on
and
that
is
much
she
said
bitterly
my
husband
sometimes
pays
the
rent
and
sometimes
he
does
even
do
that
i
have
made
as
high
as
four
dollars
in
a
week
but
oftener
two
or
three
is
the
most
i
get
how
in
the
world
can
you
support
yourself
husband
and
four
children
on
three
dollars
a
week
i
have
to
do
it
was
her
simple
reply
there
are
women
who
would
be
glad
to
get
three
dollars
a
week
and
think
themselves
well
off
but
how
do
you
live
on
so
small
a
sum
we
have
to
deny
ourselves
almost
every
little
comfort
and
confine
ourselves
down
to
the
mere
necessaries
of
life
after
those
who
can
afford
to
pay
good
prices
for
their
marketing
have
been
supplied
we
come
in
for
a
part
of
what
remains
i
often
get
meat
enough
for
a
few
cents
to
last
me
for
several
days
and
its
the
same
way
with
vegetables
after
the
markets
are
over
the
butchers
and
country
people
whom
we
know
let
us
have
lots
of
things
for
almost
nothing
sooner
than
take
them
home
in
this
way
we
make
our
slender
means
go
a
great
deal
farther
than
they
would
if
we
had
to
pay
the
highest
market
price
for
every
thing
but
it
often
happens
that
what
we
gain
here
is
lost
in
the
eagerness
we
feel
to
sell
whatever
we
have
especially
when
from
having
walked
and
cried
for
a
long
time
we
become
much
fatigued
almost
every
one
complains
that
we
ask
too
much
for
our
things
if
we
happen
to
be
one
or
two
cents
above
what
somebody
has
paid
in
market
where
there
are
almost
as
many
different
prices
as
there
are
persons
who
sell
and
in
consequence
almost
every
one
tries
to
beat
us
down
it
often
happens
that
after
i
have
walked
for
hours
and
sold
but
very
little
i
have
parted
with
my
whole
stock
at
cost
to
some
two
or
three
ladies
who
would
not
have
bought
from
me
at
all
if
they
had
known
that
they
were
making
good
bargains
out
of
me
and
this
because
i
could
not
bear
up
any
longer
i
think
it
very
hard
sometimes
when
ladies
who
have
every
thing
in
plenty
take
off
nearly
all
my
profits
after
i
have
toiled
through
the
hot
sun
for
hours
or
shivered
in
the
cold
of
winter
it
is
no
doubt
right
enough
for
every
one
to
be
prudent
and
buy
things
as
low
as
possible
but
it
has
never
seemed
to
me
as
quite
just
for
a
rich
lady
to
beat
down
a
poor
or
a
cent
or
two
on
a
bunch
or
basket
when
that
very
cent
made
perhaps
or
of
her
profits
it
was
only
yesterday
that
i
stopped
at
a
house
to
sell
a
bunch
of
fish
the
lady
took
a
fancy
to
a
nice
bunch
of
small
rock
for
which
i
asked
her
twenty
cents
they
had
cost
me
just
sixteen
cents
you
take
three
fips
she
asked
leaves
me
too
small
a
profit
madam
i
replied
want
too
much
profit
she
returned
saw
just
such
a
bunch
of
fish
in
market
yesterday
for
three
fips
but
remember
i
replied
here
are
the
fish
at
your
door
you
neither
have
to
send
for
them
nor
to
bring
them
home
yourself
as
to
that
she
answered
have
a
waiter
whose
business
it
is
to
carry
the
marketing
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
so
if
you
expect
to
sell
me
your
things
you
must
do
it
at
the
market
prices
i
will
give
you
three
fips
for
that
bunch
of
fish
and
no
more
i
had
walked
a
great
deal
and
sold
but
little
i
was
tired
and
half
sick
with
a
dreadful
headache
it
was
time
for
me
to
think
about
getting
home
so
i
said
i
suppose
you
must
take
them
but
it
leaves
me
only
a
mere
trifle
for
my
profit
a
servant
standing
by
took
the
fish
and
the
lady
handed
me
a
quarter
and
held
out
her
hand
for
the
change
i
first
put
into
it
a
five
cent
piece
she
continued
holding
it
out
until
i
searched
about
in
ny
pocket
for
a
penny
this
i
next
placed
in
her
hand
cheated
me
out
of
a
cent
at
last
she
said
half
laughing
and
half
in
earnest
are
a
sad
rogue
a
little
boy
was
standing
by
charley
she
said
to
him
a
penny
i
have
just
saved
you
can
buy
a
candy
with
it
as
i
turned
away
from
the
door
of
the
large
beautiful
house
in
which
that
lady
lived
i
felt
something
rising
in
my
throat
and
choking
me
i
had
bitter
thoughts
of
all
my
kind
happily
where
i
next
stopped
i
met
with
one
more
considerate
she
bought
two
bunches
of
my
fish
at
my
own
price
spoke
very
kindly
to
me
and
even
went
so
far
seeing
that
i
looked
jaded
out
to
tell
me
to
go
down
into
her
kitchen
and
rest
myself
for
a
little
while
leaving
my
tub
of
fish
in
her
yard
i
accepted
the
kind
offer
it
so
happened
that
the
cook
was
making
tea
for
some
one
in
the
house
who
was
sick
the
lady
asked
me
if
i
would
not
like
to
have
a
cup
i
said
yes
for
my
head
was
aching
badly
and
i
felt
faint
and
besides
i
had
not
tasted
a
cup
of
tea
for
several
days
she
poured
it
out
with
her
own
hands
and
with
her
own
hands
brought
it
to
me
i
think
i
never
tasted
such
a
cup
of
tea
in
my
life
it
was
like
cordial
god
bless
her
when
i
again
went
out
upon
the
street
my
headache
was
gone
and
i
felt
as
fresh
as
ever
i
did
in
my
life
before
i
stopped
at
this
kind
lady
house
i
was
so
worn
down
and
out
of
heart
that
i
determined
to
go
home
even
though
not
more
than
half
my
fish
were
sold
but
now
i
went
on
cheerful
and
with
confidence
in
an
hour
my
tray
was
empty
and
my
fish
sold
at
fair
prices
you
do
not
know
madam
continued
the
woman
how
much
good
a
few
kindly
spoken
words
that
cost
nothing
or
a
little
generous
regard
for
us
does
our
often
discouraged
hearts
but
these
we
too
rarely
meet
much
oftener
we
are
talked
to
harshly
about
our
exorbitant
prices
called
a
cheating
set
or
some
such
name
that
does
not
sound
very
pleasant
to
our
ears
that
there
are
many
among
us
who
have
no
honesty
nor
indeed
any
care
about
what
is
right
is
too
true
but
all
are
not
so
to
judge
us
all
then
by
the
worst
of
our
class
is
not
right
it
would
not
be
well
for
the
world
if
all
were
thus
judged
chapter

something
more
about
cooks
for
sometime
i
had
a
treasure
of
a
cook
a
fine
bucks
county
girl
whose
strongest
recommendation
in
my
eyes
when
i
engaged
her
was
that
she
had
never
been
out
of
sight
of
land
but
she
left
my
house
for
a
better
place
as
she
said
i
might
have
bribed
her
to
remain
by
an
offer
of
higher
wages
but
experience
had
demonstrated
to
my
satisfaction
that
this
kind
of
bribery
never
turns
out
well
your
servant
in
most
instances
soon
becomes
your
mistress
or
at
least
makes
bold
efforts
to
assume
that
position
so
i
let
my
bucks
county
girl
go
to
her
better
place
as
to
how
or
why
it
was
to
be
a
better
place
i
did
not
make
enquiry
that
was
her
business
she
was
a
free
agent
and
i
did
not
attempt
to
influence
her
in
fact
being
of
rather
an
independent
turn
of
mind
myself
i
sympathize
with
others
in
their
independence
and
rarely
seek
to
interfere
with
a
declared
course
of
action
my
new
cook
unfortunately
had
been
out
of
sight
of
land
and
that
for
weeks
together
she
was
fresh
from
the
emerald
island
when
she
presented
herself
i
saw
in
her
but
small
promise
having
learned
on
enquiry
that
her
name
was
alice
mahoney
i
said
how
long
have
you
been
in
this
country
alice
there
was
a
moment
or
two
of
hesitation
then
she
answered
sax
months
mum
i
learned
afterwards
that
she
had
arrived
only
three
days
before
can
you
cook
i
enquired
och
yis
ony
thing
from
a
rib
of
bafe
down
till
a
parate
you
sure
of
that
alice
och
sure
mum
can
you
give
me
a
reference
i
got
a
from
jordan
where
i
lived
in
new
york
i
only
been
here
a
few
days
biddy
jones
knows
me
and
she
produced
a
written
testification
of
ability
signed
mary
jones
william
street
new
york
there
was
a
suspicious
look
about
this
but
of
course
i
had
no
means
of
deciding
whether
it
were
a
true
or
false
document
after
some
debate
with
myself
i
finally
decided
to
give
alice
a
trial
it
so
happened
that
on
the
very
day
she
came
an
old
lady
friend
of
my
mother
accompanied
by
her
two
daughters
both
married
and
housekeepers
called
to
spend
the
afternoon
and
take
tea
as
they
lived
at
some
distance
i
had
tea
quite
early
not
waiting
for
smith
whose
business
kept
him
away
pretty
late
during
the
afternoon
my
butter
man
came
occasionally
he
brings
some
very
nice
country
sausages
and
i
always
make
it
a
point
to
secure
a
few
pounds
when
he
does
so
he
had
some
on
this
occasion
alice
said
i
as
i
entered
the
kitchen
about
four
i
want
you
to
hurry
and
get
tea
ready
as
quickly
as
you
can
yes
mum
was
the
ready
reply
and
alice
i
added
we
have
some
of
these
sausages
with
the
tea
they
are
very
fine
ones
better
than
we
usually
get
be
sure
to
cook
them
very
nice
yes
mum
promptly
answered
the
girl
looking
quite
intelligent
a
few
more
directions
as
to
what
we
were
to
have
were
given
and
then
i
went
up
to
sit
with
my
company
it
was
not
my
intention
to
leave
all
to
the
doubtful
skill
of
my
new
cook
but
either
the
time
passed
very
rapidly
or
she
was
more
prompt
and
active
than
is
usual
among
cooks
for
the
tea
bell
rung
before
i
was
in
expectation
of
hearing
it
ah
said
i
there
is
our
tea
bell
and
i
arose
adding
will
you
walk
into
the
ladies
the
words
were
no
sooner
uttered
than
a
doubt
as
to
all
being
as
i
could
wish
crossed
my
mind
and
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
first
repaired
to
the
alone
but
as
it
was
too
late
now
or
rather
i
did
not
happen
to
have
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
recall
my
invitation
to
the
ladies
to
walk
in
to
tea
until
i
had
preceded
them
a
few
minutes
well
we
were
presently
seated
at
the
tea
table
my
practised
eye
instantly
saw
that
the
cloth
was
laid
crookedly
and
that
the
dishes
were
placed
in
a
slovenly
manner
i
could
help
a
passing
apology
on
the
ground
of
a
new
domestic
and
then
proceeded
to
the
business
of
pouring
out
the
tea
the
cups
were
handed
around
and
i
soon
noticed
that
my
guests
were
sipping
from
their
spoons
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
manner
i
was
in
the
act
of
filling
my
own
cup
from
the
tea
urn
when
i
missed
the
plate
of
sausages
about
which
i
had
boasted
to
my
lady
friends
as
something
a
little
better
than
were
usually
to
be
obtained
so
i
rung
the
table
bell
alice
presently
made
her
appearance
alice
said
i
where
are
the
sausages
i
told
you
to
cook
you
surely
forgotten
them
och
no
indade
mum
they
there
where
i
do
see
them
and
my
eyes
ran
around
the
table
they
wid
the
ta
mum
sure
with
the
tea
sure
mum
they
wid
the
ta
ye
towld
me
yees
wanted
the
sausages
wid
the
ta
and
sure
they
there
i
biled
well
a
light
now
flashed
over
my
mind
throwing
up
the
lid
of
the
tea
urn
i
thrust
in
a
fork
which
immediately
came
in
contact
with
a
hard
substance
i
drew
it
forth
and
exhibited
a
single
link
of
a
well
biled
sausage
let
me
draw
a
veil
over
what
followed
chapter
xiv
not
a
rag
on
their
backs
there
are
among
the
many
things
which
smith
like
other
men
will
understand
frequent
difficulties
about
the
clothing
he
seems
to
think
that
frocks
and
trowsers
grow
spontaneously
or
that
the
dry
goods
once
bought
and
brought
into
the
house
will
resolve
into
the
shapes
desired
and
fit
themselves
to
the
children
backs
like
cindarella
suit
in
the
nursery
tale
now
i
never
did
claim
to
be
a
sprite
and
i
am
not
sure
that
the
experience
of
all
housekeepers
will
bear
me
out
in
the
opinion
that
the
longer
a
woman
is
married
the
less
she
becomes
like
a
fairy
stitch
stitch
stitch
hood
song
of
the
shirt
which
every
body
has
heard
and
admired
is
certainly
most
eloquent
and
pathetic
upon
the
sufferings
and
difficulties
of
sewing
girls
much
yet
remains
unsung
particularly
in
regard
to
the
ceaseless
labors
of
women
who
are
as
rich
as
cornelia
in
jewels
i
am
sure
that
the
roman
matron
never
went
shopping
i
am
sure
that
she
did
not
undertake
to
keep
her
own
children
clothing
in
repair
for
if
she
had
she
could
not
have
been
ready
at
a
moment
warning
to
put
forward
her
troublesome
charge
as
specimen
jewels
do
all
i
can
my
little
comforts
never
fit
to
be
seen
many
is
the
weary
evening
that
i
have
been
occupied
past
the
noon
of
night
in
repairing
the
wear
and
tear
of
habiliments
abridging
the
volume
of
the
elder
children
clothes
into
narrow
dimensions
for
the
next
or
compiling
a
suit
for
one
out
of
the
fringed
raiment
of
two
or
three
honest
was
the
pride
with
which
i
have
surveyed
these
industrious
efforts
and
sincere
the
thought
that
i
had
really
accomplished
something
depositing
the
various
articles
where
the
wearers
elect
would
find
them
i
have
retired
to
rest
almost
angry
with
smith
who
was
asleep
hours
before
me
asleep
as
unconcernedly
as
if
an
indestructible
substance
fabric
had
been
invented
for
children
clothing
well
after
such
a
night
work
imagine
me
waking
with
a
complacent
and
happy
sensation
that
my
work
having
been
on
the
day
before
the
morning
is
open
for
new
employment
down
stairs
i
come
full
of
the
thoughts
of
the
confusion
i
shall
heap
on
smith
head
he
observe
told
me
as
he
left
me
to
retire
that
i
had
much
better
go
to
bed
for
all
my
work
would
amount
to
nothing
but
loss
of
necessary
rest
i
am
ready
to
show
him
triumphant
evidence
to
the
contrary
in
the
clothes
as
good
as
new
in
which
his
children
are
habited
before
i
can
speak
i
discern
a
lurking
smile
in
his
face
my
boy
will
stands
in
a
sheepish
posture
with
his
back
as
close
to
the
jam
as
if
he
were
a
polypus
growing
there
and
his
life
depended
upon
the
adhesion
my
eldest
girl
another
of
the
laboriously
fitted
out
of
the
night
before
has
a
marvellous
affection
for
the
little
stool
and
the
skirt
of
her
frock
seems
drawn
about
her
feet
in
a
most
unbecoming
manner
but
the
third
an
inveterate
little
romp
unconscious
of
shame
is
curveting
about
in
the
most
abandoned
manner
utterly
indifferent
to
the
fact
she
has
not
indeed
a
rag
to
her
back
for
she
is
rags
one
hour
play
before
my
descent
has
utterly
abolished
all
traces
of
my
industry
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
i
expostulate
at
first
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
but
as
smith
face
expands
into
a
broad
laugh
it
becomes
more
anger
than
sorrow
the
child
on
the
stool
looks
as
if
she
would
laugh
if
she
lifting
her
up
suddenly
i
discover
that
the
whole
front
breadth
of
her
frock
is
burned
past
redemption
i
say
nothing
what
i
say
i
have
not
words
equal
to
the
emergency
and
the
boy
boys
such
copies
of
their
fathers
he
actually
forgets
all
embarrassment
and
breaks
out
into
a
hearty
laugh
i
jerk
him
forward
horror
on
horrors
the
unveiling
of
the
bavarian
statue
of
which
i
read
an
account
in
the
newspapers
the
other
day
is
nothing
to
it
the
jamb
it
appears
has
supported
something
besides
the
mantle
shelf
for
when
i
draw
the
young
smith
forward
deprived
of
the
friendly
aid
of
the
wall
his
teguments
drop
to
the
floor
and
stands
unveiled
one
fell
swoop
at
rude
play
has
destroyed
all
my
little
innumerable
stitches
and
i
am
just
where
i
was
before
i
threaded
a
needle
the
night
before
now
i
appeal
to
any
body
any
woman
with
the
least
experience
if
this
is
not
all
and
yet
my
husband
insists
that
i
have
no
need
to
be
continually
worrying
myself
with
the
needle
it
true
that
each
of
the
children
has
four
or
five
changes
of
clothes
which
they
might
wear
but
what
is
the
use
of
their
having
things
to
put
right
on
and
tear
right
out
i
like
to
be
prudent
and
saving
it
was
only
the
other
day
that
smith
came
in
early
and
found
me
busy
and
commenced
a
regular
oration
he
said
that
every
child
in
the
house
has
a
better
wardrobe
than
he
and
so
he
went
on
and
counted
all
off
to
me
he
says
and
men
think
they
know
that
if
children
have
clothes
they
should
wear
them
and
when
they
are
worn
out
provide
more
and
not
try
to
keep
as
many
suits
in
repair
as
there
are
new
suits
in
a
wardrobe
but
he
likes
as
well
as
any
man
to
see
his
children
look
neat
whatever
he
may
say
and
yet
he
pretends
that
children
should
have
clothes
so
made
that
they
can
convert
themselves
into
horses
and
treat
each
other
to
rides
without
rending
to
pieces
and
he
protests
that
it
is
all
nonsense
to
undertake
to
keep
children
dressed
in
the
fashion
truly
i
am
tempted
to
say
to
the
men
as
job
did
to
his
friends
no
doubt
but
ye
are
the
people
and
wisdom
shall
die
with
you
such
plagues
as
they
are
sometimes
but
i
could
not
help
laughing
after
all
when
as
i
said
before
he
was
lecturing
me
the
table
was
covered
with
work
done
and
in
progress
he
went
on
till
out
of
breath
i
answered
now
you
know
the
children
have
not
a
rag
to
their
backs
i
should
think
not
he
said
drily
as
he
looked
about
him
the
other
morning
finished
up
the
rags
on
hand
but
you
are
doing
your
best
with
flimsy
finery
to
get
up
a
new
assortment
now
that
is
unkind
in
you
smith
said
i
feeling
hurt
and
looking
and
speaking
as
i
felt
really
unkind
in
you
i
sure
no
pleasure
for
me
to
work
work
work
from
morning
till
night
until
i
worn
down
and
good
for
nothing
i
wish
my
children
to
look
decent
at
least
and
to
do
this
at
as
small
cost
to
you
as
possible
you
ca
change
me
with
wasting
your
property
at
least
there
there
dear
that
will
do
say
no
more
about
it
returned
smith
in
a
soothing
voice
i
did
mean
to
be
unkind
still
i
do
think
that
you
are
a
little
about
the
children
clothes
as
i
have
said
before
in
the
matter
of
having
things
better
a
great
deal
i
think
spare
a
few
hours
from
given
to
the
clothing
designed
for
their
bodies
to
that
which
is
to
array
and
beautify
their
minds
now
mr
smith
i
exclaimed
and
then
bending
my
face
into
my
hands
gave
way
to
involuntary
tears
that
he
should
have
said
this
chapter
xv
curiosity
the
curiosity
of
our
sex
is
proverbial
proverbs
are
generally
based
upon
experience
and
this
one
i
am
ready
to
admit
is
not
without
a
good
foundation
to
rest
upon
our
sex
are
curious
at
least
i
am
and
we
are
very
apt
to
judge
others
by
ourselves
i
believe
that
i
have
never
broken
the
seal
nor
peeped
into
a
letter
bearing
the
name
of
some
other
lady
but
then
i
will
own
to
having
on
more
occasions
than
one
felt
an
exceedingly
strong
desire
to
know
the
contents
of
certain
epistles
in
the
hands
of
certain
of
my
friends
the
same
feeling
i
have
over
and
over
again
observed
in
my
domestics
and
for
this
reason
have
always
been
careful
how
i
let
my
letters
lie
temptingly
about
one
chamber
maid
in
my
service
seemed
to
have
a
passion
for
reading
other
people
letters
more
than
once
had
i
caught
her
rummaging
in
my
drawers
or
with
some
of
my
old
letters
in
her
hands
and
i
could
not
help
remarking
that
most
of
the
letters
left
at
the
door
by
the
penny
post
had
if
they
passed
to
me
through
her
a
crumpled
appearance
i
suspected
the
cause
of
this
but
did
not
detect
my
lady
until
she
had
been
some
months
in
my
family
one
morning
after
breakfast
was
over
and
the
children
off
to
school
i
drew
on
a
cap
and
went
down
to
sweep
out
and
dust
the
parlors
i
had
not
been
at
work
long
when
i
heard
the
bell
ring
presently
mary
came
tripping
down
stairs
as
she
opened
the
street
door
i
heard
her
say
ah
another
letter
who
is
it
for
me
no
it
is
for
smith
was
answered
in
the
rougher
voice
of
the
despatch
oh
there
was
a
perceptible
disappointment
in
mary
tone
the
postage
she
asked
paid
said
the
man
the
door
closed
and
i
heard
the
feet
of
mary
slowly
moving
along
the
passage
then
the
murmur
of
her
voice
reached
my
ears
presently
i
heard
her
say
i
wonder
who
it
is
from
smith
gets
a
great
many
letters
no
envelope
thank
goodness
but
a
plain
good
old
fashioned
letter
i
must
see
who
it
is
from
by
this
time
mary
had
stepped
within
the
back
parlor
i
stood
hid
from
her
view
by
one
of
the
folding
doors
which
was
closed
but
within
a
few
feet
of
her
from
jackson
hum
i
wonder
what
she
got
to
say
something
about
me
i
bet
a
dollar
there
was
a
very
apparent
change
in
the
thermometer
of
feelings
at
this
last
thought
as
was
evident
from
the
tone
of
her
voice
lace
collars
stockings
pocket
han
i
ca
make
out
that
word
but
it
is
handkerchiefs
of
course
thus
mary
read
and
talked
to
herself
breastpin
this
is
too
mean
it
not
true
neither
i
a
great
mind
to
burn
the
letter
smith
would
never
be
the
wiser
i
wo
give
it
to
her
now
at
any
rate
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
just
think
about
it
the
next
sound
that
came
to
my
ears
was
the
pattering
of
mary
feet
as
she
went
hurrying
up
the
stairs
in
a
few
minutes
i
followed
in
one
of
my
chambers
i
found
mary
and
said
to
her
did
the
carrier
leave
me
a
letter
just
now
the
girl
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
answered
oh
yes
i
have
it
here
in
my
pocket
and
she
drew
forth
the
letter
crumbled
as
was
usually
the
case
with
all
that
passed
through
her
hands
i
took
it
with
some
gravity
of
manner
for
i
felt
naturally
enough
indignant
mary
flushed
a
little
under
the
steady
eye
that
i
fixed
upon
her
the
letter
or
note
was
from
my
friend
jackman
and
read
as
follows
my
dear
mrs
do
call
in
and
see
me
some
time
i
have
bought
some
of
the
cheapest
laces
stockings
and
cambric
pocket
handkerchiefs
that
ever
were
seen
there
are
more
left
and
at
a
great
bargain
you
must
have
some
and
by
the
way
bring
with
you
that
sweet
breastpin
i
saw
you
wear
at
may
last
thursday
evening
i
want
to
examine
it
closely
i
must
have
one
just
like
it
do
come
round
i
lots
of
things
to
say
to
you
yours
nothing
so
dreadful
in
all
that
i
said
to
myself
as
i
the
letter
my
curious
lady
conscience
must
be
a
little
active
let
see
what
is
to
come
of
this
it
is
hardly
in
the
nature
of
woman
to
look
very
lovingly
upon
the
servant
whom
she
has
discovered
peeping
into
her
letters
at
least
it
was
not
in
my
nature
i
therefore
treated
mary
with
becoming
gravity
whenever
we
happened
to
meet
she
under
the
circumstances
was
ill
at
ease
and
rather
shunned
contact
with
me
the
morning
passed
away
and
the
afternoon
waned
until
towards
five
when
the
accumulating
pressure
on
mary
feelings
became
so
great
that
she
was
compelled
to
seek
relief
i
was
alone
sewing
when
my
chamber
maid
entered
my
room
the
corners
of
her
lips
inclined
considerably
downward
can
i
speak
a
word
with
you
mrs
smith
said
she
certainly
mary
i
replied
what
do
you
wish
to
say
mary
cleared
her
throat
once
or
twice
looked
very
much
embarrassed
and
at
length
stammered
out
you
received
a
letter
from
jackson
this
morning
no
i
shook
my
head
as
i
uttered
this
little
monosyllable
a
flush
of
surprise
went
over
the
girl
face
was
the
letter
i
gave
you
from
mrs
jackson
she
asked
no
it
was
from
mrs
jackman
mary
caught
her
breath
and
stammered
out
in
her
confusion
oh
my
i
thought
it
was
from
jackson
i
was
sure
of
it
what
right
had
you
to
think
any
thing
about
it
i
asked
with
marked
severity
mary
face
was
by
this
time
crimsoned
i
looked
at
her
for
some
moments
and
then
taking
from
my
drawer
jackman
note
handed
it
to
her
and
said
there
the
letter
you
were
so
curious
about
this
morning
read
it
mary
eyes
soon
took
in
the
contents
the
moment
she
was
satisfied
she
uttered
a
short
oh
strongly
expressive
of
mental
relief
and
handed
me
back
the
letter
i
thought
it
was
from
jackson
said
the
still
embarrassed
girl
looking
confused
and
distressed
you
can
now
retire
said
i
and
when
another
letter
is
left
at
my
door
be
kind
enough
to
consider
it
my
property
not
yours
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
see
jackson
and
ascertain
from
her
why
you
are
so
much
afraid
that
she
will
communicate
with
me
some
thing
wrong
poor
mary
still
lingered
indeed
smith
she
sobbed
i
did
do
nothing
wrong
at
jackson
but
wear
her
clothes
sometimes
once
i
just
borrowed
a
breastpin
of
hers
out
of
her
drawer
to
wear
to
a
party
and
she
saw
me
with
it
on
and
said
i
had
stolen
it
but
i
put
my
hand
in
the
fire
before
i
steal
smith
indeed
indeed
i
would
i
was
only
going
to
wear
it
to
the
party
and
i
did
think
there
was
any
great
harm
in
that
of
course
there
was
harm
in
using
other
people
things
without
their
consent
i
replied
severely
and
i
do
wonder
that
jackson
accused
you
of
stealing
but
what
cause
had
you
for
thinking
this
letter
was
from
mrs
jackson
the
two
names
are
so
near
alike
and
then
jackson
speaks
about
here
mary
caught
herself
and
crimsoned
still
deeper
that
is
said
i
you
took
the
liberty
of
peeping
into
my
letter
before
you
gave
it
to
me
and
this
is
not
your
first
offence
of
the
kind
mary
was
too
much
confounded
to
speak
or
make
any
effort
to
excuse
herself
and
so
thought
it
best
to
retire
i
called
to
see
jackson
that
day
she
gave
mary
a
good
character
as
far
as
honesty
was
concerned
but
stated
plainly
her
faults
especially
her
bad
habit
of
wearing
her
clothes
and
trinkets
for
which
offence
in
a
moment
of
indignation
she
had
dismissed
her
from
her
service
i
saw
no
reason
to
send
mary
away
but
i
gave
her
a
good
talking
i
think
she
is
pretty
well
cured
of
her
propensity
of
reading
other
people
letters
chapter
xvi
i
like
a
clean
house
so
does
smith
and
so
do
all
men
if
they
would
acknowledge
it
at
any
rate
when
their
dwellings
seem
a
little
dingy
or
dusty
a
very
thin
coat
of
dinginess
or
dust
over
the
whole
producing
a
decidedly
bad
effect
i
say
when
their
dwellings
appear
to
them
out
of
order
though
ever
so
little
are
sure
to
find
it
out
the
dull
look
of
the
house
appears
to
be
communicated
to
the
countenance
of
the
master
thereof
i
confess
that
i
have
often
been
half
inclined
to
wax
and
cork
my
visage
or
at
least
to
whisk
over
it
with
the
duster
and
see
if
that
experiment
would
not
restore
its
sunny
look
but
though
men
like
clean
houses
they
do
not
like
they
have
certain
absurd
notions
which
they
would
wish
to
carry
out
such
for
instance
as
that
preventive
care
or
frequent
topical
applications
carefully
applied
would
gradually
renovate
the
whole
interior
but
who
wishes
to
be
cleaning
all
the
time
who
wishes
to
be
always
dusting
indeed
at
the
best
we
are
constantly
with
broom
brush
or
besom
in
hand
but
the
men
will
not
perceive
it
and
we
receive
no
credit
for
our
tidiness
what
is
to
be
done
then
evidently
there
is
nothing
better
than
a
demonstration
as
the
politicians
say
a
demonstration
that
may
be
felt
a
of
brooms
buckets
brushes
pails
chairs
overturned
tubs
and
all
other
possible
disagreeables
all
at
once
summoned
and
each
as
much
as
possible
in
others
way
in
this
there
is
some
satisfaction
it
looks
like
it
seems
as
if
you
were
doing
something
it
raises
the
value
of
the
operation
and
demonstrates
its
usefulness
and
necessity
for
if
there
is
little
difference
apparent
between
the
house
before
cleaning
and
after
there
is
a
world
of
odds
between
a
and
a
house
there
is
a
perfect
delight
in
seeing
what
order
be
brought
out
of
chaos
even
though
you
are
obliged
to
make
the
chaos
first
to
produce
the
effect
i
had
inflicted
several
of
these
impressive
lessons
upon
smith
he
had
become
so
much
horrified
at
their
confusion
that
i
do
believe
he
had
fully
reconciled
himself
to
dust
and
dirt
as
the
better
alternative
they
were
to
be
sure
at
some
little
cost
of
comfort
to
myself
and
reflectively
produced
discomfort
for
him
for
he
traced
with
a
correctness
which
i
could
easier
frown
at
than
deny
many
a
week
indisposition
to
my
phrenzy
and
when
a
man
wife
is
sick
if
he
is
a
man
of
feeling
he
is
unhappy
and
if
he
is
a
man
of
selfishness
he
is
wretched
too
for
what
becomes
of
husband
little
comforts
when
wife
is
not
able
to
procure
or
direct
them
so
smith
for
the
better
reason
i
believe
pure
compassion
declared
long
ago
against
wholesale
and
he
has
so
often
interfered
in
my
proceedings
with
his
provoking
prophecy
now
you
know
my
dear
it
will
make
you
sick
that
i
have
striven
many
a
time
to
hide
pain
under
a
forced
smile
when
it
seemed
as
if
my
head
was
like
to
rend
now
a
woman
carry
her
point
in
the
house
by
stubborn
daring
but
the
better
part
of
valor
is
discretion
and
i
have
learned
quietly
to
take
my
way
and
steal
a
march
upon
him
open
the
set
the
chimneys
smoking
up
with
the
carpets
throw
the
beds
out
of
the
windows
pack
the
best
china
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
distributing
pokers
and
among
it
unhang
the
pictures
set
all
the
doors
ajar
roll
the
children
in
dust
cover
my
head
with
a
soiled
put
on
shoes
and
streak
my
ancles
with
dust
and
dirty
water
then
if
he
pops
in
opportunely
i
can
say
with
shakspeare
amended
i
am
in
stept
in
so
far
that
should
i
wade
no
more
returning
were
as
tedious
as
go
and
then
husband
has
no
choice
but
to
retreat
to
a
and
leave
me
to
finish
but
the
chance
for
a
grand
saturnalia
is
best
when
smith
goes
from
home
for
a
day
or
two
then
i
can
deny
myself
to
visitors
take
full
license
set
the
hydrant
running
and
puzzle
the
water
commissioners
with
an
extra
consumption
of
schuylkill
my
last
exploit
in
this
way
was
rather
disastrous
and
i
am
patiently
waiting
for
its
memory
to
pass
away
before
i
venture
even
to
think
of
repeating
it
smith
had
business
in
new
york
imperative
business
he
said
but
i
do
believe
it
might
have
waited
had
not
jenny
lind
first
appearance
taken
place
just
then
this
by
the
way
he
went
and
i
was
rejoiced
to
improve
the
opportunity
for
it
occurred
precisely
as
i
was
devising
some
method
to
get
myself
so
fairly
committed
to
soap
and
brushes
that
objection
or
interdict
would
be
too
late
never
did
i
pack
his
with
more
secret
satisfaction
than
on
that
morning
he
was
entirely
unsuspicious
of
my
intention
though
he
might
have
divined
it
but
for
having
a
secret
of
his
own
for
kitty
operations
spoiled
the
breakfast
there
was
more
than
a
taste
of
overdone
to
the
steak
and
the
whole
affair
even
to
me
was
intolerable
me
who
had
the
pleasures
of
in
perspective
to
console
me
the
door
was
scarce
shut
behind
him
when
i
entered
into
the
business
it
was
resolved
to
begin
at
the
very
attic
and
sweep
scrub
and
wash
down
old
boxes
and
trunks
were
dragged
out
of
their
places
and
piles
of
forgotten
dust
swept
out
the
passengers
in
the
street
had
a
narrow
chance
for
their
beavers
and
fall
bonnets
for
every
front
window
had
an
extra
plashing
smith
had
several
times
urged
me
to
permit
him
to
introduce
some
yankee
fashion
which
he
highly
recommends
for
having
professional
with
their
whiting
and
brushes
who
could
go
through
the
house
with
half
the
trouble
and
none
of
the
litter
there
nothing
like
water
the
first
day
work
sufficed
to
put
the
house
into
thorough
confusion
and
i
retired
to
bed
but
not
to
rest
for
my
fatigue
was
too
great
to
sleep
in
comfort
my
neglected
child
rested
as
ill
as
myself
and
when
i
rose
the
next
morning
it
was
with
the
oppressive
weight
of
a
weary
day
before
me
i
had
the
consciousness
that
the
work
be
completed
before
my
husband
return
and
he
had
engaged
to
be
with
me
at
dinner
i
felt
it
an
imperative
duty
to
welcome
him
with
a
cheerful
house
and
a
pleasant
repast
after
his
journey
but
as
the
time
of
his
arrival
drew
near
i
was
more
and
more
convinced
of
the
impossibility
like
a
drove
of
wild
beasts
forced
into
a
corner
by
a
hunting
party
we
forced
our
unmanageable
matters
to
a
crisis
the
area
for
old
brooms
and
brushes
tubs
litter
and
slops
was
at
last
narrowed
down
to
the
kitchen
and
all
that
remained
of
our
was
to
put
that
place
into
something
like
the
semblance
of
an
apartment
devoted
to
culinary
purposes
dinner
as
yet
was
unthought
of
but
the
house
was
clean
wearied
rather
than
refreshed
by
my
night
of
unrest
my
arms
sore
and
my
limbs
heavy
i
labored
with
double
zeal
to
get
up
an
excitement
which
should
carry
me
through
the
remainder
of
the
day
my
head
began
to
feel
sensations
of
giddiness
for
i
had
hardly
eaten
since
my
husband
left
of
the
pleasures
of
i
had
at
length
a
surfeit
when
a
ring
which
i
knew
among
all
others
surprised
me
i
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
past
four
and
the
kitchen
still
in
confusion
and
the
hearth
cold
i
sank
in
a
a
swoon
from
sheer
exhaustion
when
i
awoke
to
consciousness
an
overturned
pale
of
water
was
being
absorbed
by
my
clothing
my
nose
was
rejecting
with
violent
aversion
the
pungency
of
a
bottle
of
prime
durham
mustard
to
which
kitty
had
applied
as
the
best
substitute
for
salts
which
the
kitchen
afforded
and
my
husband
and
cane
in
hand
was
pushing
his
way
toward
me
with
more
haste
than
good
speed
as
the
obstacles
witnessed
which
he
encountered
and
overturned
i
was
confined
to
my
room
a
week
which
i
could
not
conceal
from
smith
but
he
does
not
even
yet
know
the
whole
amount
of
the
breakage
and
thank
fortune
he
is
too
much
of
a
man
to
ask
i
am
only
afraid
that
he
will
succeed
in
forcing
me
to
admit
that
what
he
calls
his
classical
proposition
is
true
that
to
clean
a
house
does
not
require
the
feat
of
a
hercules
to
wit
turning
a
river
through
it
this
is
my
story
of
and
it
is
in
no
very
high
degree
flattering
to
my
housekeeping
vanity
perhaps
the
thing
might
be
managed
differently
but
i
do
know
out
of
chaos
order
comes
while
on
this
subject
it
will
be
all
in
place
to
introduce
another
story
which
i
find
floating
about
in
the
newspapers
it
presents
the
matter
from
another
point
of
view
and
was
written
it
will
be
seen
by
a
man
talk
of
a
washing
day
what
is
that
to
a
whole
week
of
no
even
this
gives
no
true
idea
of
that
worst
of
domestic
afflictions
a
poor
man
can
suffer
the
washing
is
confined
to
the
kitchen
or
and
the
effect
visible
in
the
is
in
cold
or
badly
cooked
meals
with
a
few
other
matters
not
necessary
to
mention
here
but
in
the
oh
dear
like
the
dove
from
the
ark
a
man
finds
no
place
where
he
can
rest
the
sole
of
his
foot
twice
a
year
regularly
have
i
to
pass
through
this
trying
ordeal
as
it
is
said
in
some
strange
language
to
rebel
is
useless
to
grumble
of
no
avail
up
come
the
carpets
topsyturvy
goes
the
furniture
and
goes
the
water
from
garret
to
cellar
i
do
know
how
other
men
act
on
these
occasions
but
i
find
discretion
the
better
part
of
valor
and
submission
the
wisest
expedient
usually
it
happens
that
my
good
wife
works
herself
half
to
death
loses
the
even
balance
of
her
mind
and
in
consequence
makes
herself
and
all
around
her
unhappy
to
indulge
in
an
unamiable
temper
is
by
no
means
a
common
thing
for
sunderland
and
this
makes
its
occurrence
on
these
occasions
so
much
the
harder
to
bear
our
last
took
place
in
the
fall
i
have
been
going
to
write
a
faithful
history
of
what
was
said
done
and
suffered
on
the
occasion
ever
since
and
now
put
my
design
into
execution
even
at
the
risk
of
having
my
head
combed
with
a
stool
by
my
excellent
wife
who
when
she
sees
this
in
print
will
be
taken
in
nautical
phrase
all
aback
but
when
a
history
of
our
own
shortcomings
mishaps
mistakes
and
misadventures
will
do
others
good
i
am
for
giving
the
history
and
pocketing
the
odium
if
there
be
such
a
thing
as
odium
attached
to
revelations
of
human
weakness
and
error
we
must
clean
house
this
week
said
my
good
wife
one
morning
as
we
sat
at
the
every
thing
is
in
a
dreadful
condition
i
ca
look
at
nor
touch
any
thing
without
feeling
my
flesh
creep
i
turned
my
eyes
involuntarily
around
the
room
i
was
not
before
aware
of
the
filthy
state
in
which
we
were
living
but
not
having
so
good
an
eye
for
dirt
as
sunderland
i
was
not
able
even
after
having
my
attention
called
to
the
fact
to
see
the
dreadful
condition
of
things
i
said
nothing
however
for
i
never
like
to
interfere
in
my
wife
department
i
assume
it
as
a
fact
that
she
knows
her
own
business
better
than
i
do
our
domestic
establishment
consisted
at
this
time
of
a
cook
chamber
maid
and
waiter
this
was
an
ample
force
my
wife
considered
for
all
purposes
of
and
had
so
announced
to
the
individuals
concerned
some
days
before
she
mentioned
the
matter
incidentally
to
me
we
had
experienced
in
common
with
others
our
own
troubles
with
servants
but
were
now
excellently
well
off
in
this
respect
things
had
gone
on
for
months
with
scarcely
a
jar
this
was
a
pleasant
feature
in
affairs
and
one
upon
which
we
often
congratulated
ourselves
when
i
came
home
at
on
the
day
the
anticipated
had
been
mentioned
to
me
i
found
my
wife
with
a
long
face
are
you
not
well
i
asked
i
well
enough
sunderland
answered
but
i
out
of
all
patience
with
ann
and
hannah
what
is
the
matter
with
them
i
asked
in
surprise
they
are
both
going
at
the
end
of
this
week
indeed
how
comes
that
i
thought
they
were
very
well
satisfied
so
they
were
all
along
until
the
time
for
approached
it
is
too
bad
that
it
is
it
yes
and
i
feel
out
of
all
patience
about
it
it
shows
such
a
want
of
principle
is
john
going
too
i
asked
dear
knows
i
expect
so
he
been
as
sulky
as
he
could
be
all
the
morning
in
fact
ever
since
i
told
him
that
he
must
begin
taking
up
the
carpets
and
shake
them
do
you
think
ann
and
hannah
will
really
go
i
asked
of
course
they
will
i
have
received
formal
notice
to
supply
their
places
by
the
end
of
this
week
which
i
must
do
somehow
or
other
the
next
day
was
thursday
and
notwithstanding
both
cook
and
chamber
maid
had
given
notice
that
they
were
going
on
saturday
my
wife
had
the
whole
house
knocked
into
as
the
printers
say
determined
to
get
all
she
could
out
of
them
when
i
made
my
appearance
at
i
found
all
in
precious
confusion
and
my
wife
heated
and
worried
excessively
nothing
was
going
on
right
she
had
undertaken
to
get
the
dinner
in
order
that
ann
and
hannah
might
proceed
uninterruptedly
in
the
work
of
but
as
ann
and
hannah
had
given
notice
to
quit
in
order
to
escape
this
very
they
were
in
no
humor
to
put
things
ahead
in
consequence
they
had
poked
about
and
done
nothing
to
use
sunderland
own
language
at
which
she
was
no
little
incensed
when
evening
came
i
found
things
worse
my
wife
had
set
her
whole
force
to
work
upon
our
chamber
early
in
the
day
in
order
to
have
it
finished
as
quickly
as
possible
that
it
might
be
in
a
sleeping
condition
by
night
dry
and
well
aired
but
instead
of
this
ann
and
hannah
had
the
whole
day
over
cleaning
the
paint
and
now
the
floor
was
not
even
washed
up
my
poor
wife
was
a
sad
way
about
it
and
i
am
sure
that
i
felt
uncomfortable
enough
afraid
to
sleep
in
a
damp
chamber
we
put
two
sofas
together
in
the
parlor
and
passed
the
night
there
the
morning
rose
cloudily
enough
i
understood
matters
clearly
if
sunderland
had
hired
a
couple
of
women
for
two
or
three
days
to
do
the
cleaning
and
got
a
man
to
shake
the
carpets
nothing
would
have
been
heard
about
the
sulkiness
of
john
or
the
notice
to
quit
of
cook
and
chamber
maid
putting
upon
them
the
task
of
was
considered
an
imposition
and
they
were
not
disposed
to
stand
it
i
shall
not
be
home
to
dinner
i
said
as
i
rose
from
the
breakfast
table
as
you
are
all
in
so
much
confusion
and
you
have
to
do
the
cooking
i
prefer
getting
something
to
eat
down
town
very
well
said
sunderland
so
much
the
better
i
left
the
house
a
few
minutes
afterwards
glad
to
get
away
every
thing
was
confusion
and
every
face
under
a
cloud
how
are
you
getting
along
i
asked
on
coming
home
at
night
humph
not
getting
along
at
all
replied
sunderland
in
a
fretful
tone
in
two
days
the
girls
might
have
thoroughly
cleaned
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
and
what
do
you
think
they
have
done
nothing
at
all
nothing
at
all
they
must
have
done
something
well
next
to
nothing
then
they
hav
finished
the
front
and
back
chambers
and
what
is
worse
ann
has
gone
away
sick
and
hannah
is
in
bed
with
a
real
or
pretended
oh
dear
i
ejaculated
involuntarily
now
things
in
a
pretty
way
i
think
they
are
i
replied
and
then
asked
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
have
sent
john
for
old
jane
who
helped
us
to
clean
house
last
spring
but
as
likely
as
not
she
at
work
somewhere
such
was
in
fact
the
case
for
john
came
in
a
moment
after
with
that
consoling
report
go
and
see
nancy
then
my
wife
said
sharply
to
john
as
if
he
were
to
blame
for
jane
being
at
work
john
turned
away
slowly
and
went
on
his
errand
evidently
in
not
the
most
amiable
mood
in
the
world
it
was
soon
ascertained
that
nancy
could
come
why
ca
she
come
enquired
my
wife
she
says
she
doing
some
sewing
for
herself
and
ca
go
out
this
week
replied
john
go
and
tell
her
that
she
must
come
that
my
house
is
upside
down
and
both
the
girls
are
sick
but
nancy
was
in
no
mood
to
comply
john
brought
back
another
negative
go
and
say
to
her
john
that
i
will
not
take
no
for
an
answer
that
she
must
come
i
will
give
her
a
dollar
a
day
this
liberal
offer
of
a
dollar
a
day
was
effective
nancy
came
and
went
to
work
on
the
next
morning
of
course
ann
did
not
come
back
and
as
it
was
hannah
last
day
she
felt
privileged
to
have
more
headache
than
was
consistent
with
cleaning
paint
or
scrubbing
floors
the
work
went
on
therefore
very
slowly
saturday
night
found
us
without
cook
or
and
with
only
two
rooms
in
order
in
the
whole
house
viz
our
chambers
on
the
second
story
by
great
persuasion
nancy
was
induced
to
stay
during
sunday
and
cook
for
us
an
advertisement
in
the
newspaper
on
monday
morning
brought
us
a
couple
of
raw
irish
girls
who
were
taken
as
better
than
nobody
at
all
with
these
new
recruits
sunderland
set
about
getting
things
to
right
nancy
plodded
on
so
well
pleased
with
her
wages
that
she
continued
to
get
the
work
of
one
day
lengthened
out
into
two
and
so
managed
to
get
a
week
job
for
the
whole
of
another
precious
week
we
were
in
confusion
how
do
your
new
girls
get
along
i
asked
of
my
wife
upon
whose
face
i
had
not
seen
a
smile
for
ten
days
do
name
them
sunderland
they
not
worth
the
powder
it
would
take
to
shoot
them
lazy
ignorant
dirty
creatures
i
would
give
them
i
sorry
to
learn
that
what
will
you
do
i
said
dear
knows
i
was
so
well
suited
in
ann
and
hannah
and
to
think
that
they
should
have
served
me
so
i
would
have
believed
it
of
them
but
they
are
all
as
destitute
of
feeling
and
principle
as
they
can
be
and
john
continues
as
sulky
as
a
bear
he
pretended
to
shake
the
carpets
but
you
might
get
a
of
dirt
out
of
them
i
told
him
so
and
the
impudent
follow
replied
that
he
know
any
thing
about
shaking
carpets
and
that
it
was
the
waiter
place
any
how
he
did
yes
he
did
i
was
on
the
eve
of
ordering
him
to
leave
the
house
i
save
you
that
trouble
i
said
a
little
warmly
do
say
any
thing
to
him
if
you
please
sunderland
returned
my
wife
there
could
be
a
better
man
about
the
house
than
he
is
for
all
ordinary
purposes
if
we
should
lose
him
we
shall
never
get
another
half
so
good
i
wish
i
hired
a
man
to
shake
the
carpets
at
once
they
would
have
been
much
better
done
and
i
should
have
had
john
cheerful
assistance
about
the
house
which
would
have
been
a
great
deal
that
evening
i
overheard
accidentally
a
conversation
between
john
and
the
new
girls
which
threw
some
light
upon
the
whole
matter
john
said
one
of
them
what
made
sunderland
cook
and
chamber
maid
go
aff
and
lave
her
right
in
the
middle
of
because
sunderland
instead
of
hiring
a
woman
as
every
lady
does
tried
to
put
it
all
off
upon
them
indade
and
was
that
it
yes
it
was
they
never
thought
of
leaving
until
they
found
they
were
to
be
imposed
upon
and
to
save
fifty
cents
or
a
dollar
she
made
me
shake
the
carpets
i
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
before
i
think
i
managed
to
leave
about
as
much
dirt
in
as
i
shook
out
but
i
leave
the
house
before
i
do
it
again
so
would
i
john
it
was
downright
mane
imposition
so
it
was
set
a
waiter
to
shaking
carpets
i
do
think
much
has
been
saved
remarked
the
waiter
for
nancy
has
had
a
dollar
a
day
ever
since
she
has
been
here
indade
yes
and
besides
that
sunderland
has
had
to
work
like
a
dog
herself
all
this
might
have
been
saved
if
she
had
hired
a
couple
of
women
at
and
a
half
cents
a
day
for
two
or
three
days
and
paid
for
having
the
carpets
shaken
that
the
way
other
people
do
the
house
would
have
been
set
to
rights
in
three
or
four
days
and
every
thing
going
on
like
clockwork
i
heard
no
more
i
wanted
to
hear
no
more
it
was
all
as
clear
as
day
to
me
when
i
related
to
sunderland
what
john
had
said
she
was
at
first
quite
indignant
but
the
reasonableness
of
the
thing
soon
became
so
apparent
that
she
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
she
had
acted
very
unwisely
this
is
another
specimen
of
your
saving
at
the
spigot
i
said
playfully
there
sunderland
not
a
word
more
if
you
please
of
that
she
returned
her
cheek
more
flushed
than
usual
it
is
my
duty
as
your
wife
to
dispense
with
prudence
in
your
household
and
if
in
seeking
to
do
so
i
have
run
a
little
into
extremes
i
think
it
ill
becomes
you
to
ridicule
or
censure
me
dear
knows
i
have
not
sought
my
own
ease
or
comfort
in
the
matter
my
dear
good
wife
i
quickly
said
in
a
soothing
voice
i
have
neither
meant
to
ridicule
nor
censure
you
nothing
was
farther
from
my
thoughts
you
shall
certainly
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
me
on
this
score
again
she
said
still
a
little
warmly
when
next
we
clean
house
i
will
take
care
that
it
shall
be
done
by
extra
help
altogether
do
so
by
all
means
sunderland
let
there
be
if
possible
two
and
scrubbers
in
every
room
that
the
work
may
all
be
done
in
a
day
instead
of
a
week
take
my
word
for
it
the
cost
will
be
less
or
if
double
i
will
cheerfully
pay
it
for
the
sake
of
seeing
from
chaos
rise
more
quickly
than
is
wont
under
the
ordinary
system
of
doing
things
my
wife
did
not
just
like
this
speech
i
could
see
but
she
bit
her
lips
and
kept
silent
in
a
week
we
were
without
a
cook
again
and
months
passed
before
we
were
in
any
thing
like
domestic
comfort
at
last
my
wife
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
ann
and
hannah
back
again
and
then
the
old
pleasant
order
of
things
was
restored
i
rather
think
that
we
shall
have
a
different
state
of
things
at
next
time
i
certainly
hope
so
chapter
xvii
broiling
a
lobster
smith
appetite
sometimes
takes
an
epicurean
turn
and
then
we
indulge
in
a
lobster
soup
terrapins
or
something
of
that
sort
once
upon
a
time
he
sent
home
a
lobster
i
did
not
feel
very
well
that
day
and
concluded
to
leave
the
cooking
of
the
animal
to
a
new
girl
that
i
had
taken
a
week
or
two
before
on
a
strong
recommendation
she
claimed
to
be
a
finished
cook
and
her
testimonials
were
distinct
on
that
head
kitty
said
i
smith
has
sent
home
a
lobster
i
believe
i
had
summoned
the
girl
to
my
room
yes
she
replied
is
it
for
dinner
of
course
it
is
and
you
must
see
that
it
is
well
cooked
kitty
lingered
a
few
moments
as
if
not
entirely
satisfied
about
something
and
then
retired
to
the
kitchen
i
wonder
if
she
knows
how
to
boil
a
lobster
said
i
to
myself
but
then
the
remembrance
that
she
had
come
to
me
as
a
finished
cook
crossed
my
mind
and
i
answered
mentally
my
own
question
by
saying
of
course
she
does
not
long
afterwards
i
went
to
the
which
was
over
the
kitchen
i
had
been
there
only
a
little
while
when
i
heard
an
unusual
noise
below
followed
by
an
exclamation
from
kitty
oh
murderation
i
ca
cook
the
straddling
thing
i
wonder
what
smith
brought
it
home
alive
for
i
was
of
course
all
attention
now
and
going
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
stood
listening
to
what
was
going
on
below
there
now
lie
still
i
heard
kitty
say
this
was
followed
by
a
rattling
of
tongs
or
some
other
iron
implements
and
a
rapid
shuffling
of
feet
curious
to
know
what
was
going
on
i
stepped
lightly
down
the
stairs
and
through
the
open
door
had
a
full
view
of
both
kitty
and
the
lobster
live
coals
had
been
raked
out
upon
the
hearth
over
these
was
placed
a
gridiron
and
on
this
not
very
comfortable
bed
kitty
was
endeavoring
to
force
mr
lobster
to
lie
still
and
be
cooked
but
this
he
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
do
and
no
sooner
did
she
place
him
on
the
heated
bars
than
he
made
his
way
off
in
the
quickest
possible
time
then
she
caught
hold
of
him
with
the
tongs
restored
him
to
his
proper
position
on
the
gridiron
and
with
poker
and
tongs
strove
to
hold
him
there
as
the
lobster
a
second
and
a
third
time
struggled
free
of
tongs
and
poker
i
could
no
longer
restrain
myself
but
burst

him
up

him

chapter
xviii
the
the
observance
of
economy
in
matters
of
family
expenditure
is
the
duty
of
every
housekeeper
but
there
is
an
economy
that
involves
wrong
to
others
which
as
being
unjust
and
really
dishonest
should
be
carefully
avoided
in
a
previous
chapter
i
introduced
the
story
of
a
poor
as
affording
a
lesson
for
the
humane
let
me
here
give
another
which
forcibly
illustrates
the
subject
of
oppressive
and
unjust
economy
it
is
the
story
of
a
and
appeared
in
one
of
the
magazines
some
years
ago
cried
a
poorly
clad
woman
about
eleven
o
clock
one
sultry
june
morning
she
was
passing
a
handsome
house
in
walnut
street
into
the
windows
of
which
she
looked
earnestly
in
the
hope
of
seeing
the
face
of
a
customer
she
did
not
look
in
vain
for
the
shrill
sound
of
her
voice
brought
forward
a
lady
dressed
in
a
silk
who
beckoned
her
to
stop
the
woman
lifted
the
heavy
tray
from
her
bead
and
placing
it
upon
the
sat
wearily
down
what
the
price
of
your
strawberries
asked
the
lady
as
she
came
to
the
door
ten
cents
a
box
madam
they
are
right
fresh
ten
cents
replied
the
lady
in
a
tone
of
surprise
drawing
herself
up
and
looking
grave
then
shaking
her
head
and
compressing
her
lips
firmly
she
added
i
ca
give
ten
cents
for
strawberries
it
too
much
you
ca
get
such
strawberries
as
these
for
less
madam
said
the
woman
i
got
a
levy
a
box
for
them
yesterday
then
you
got
too
much
that
all
i
have
to
say
i
never
pay
such
prices
i
bought
strawberries
in
the
market
yesterday
just
as
good
as
yours
for
eight
cents
a
box
do
know
how
they
do
to
sell
them
at
that
price
returned
the
woman
mine
cost
nearly
eight
cents
and
ought
to
bring
me
at
least
twelve
but
i
am
willing
to
take
ten
so
that
i
can
sell
out
quickly
it
a
very
hot
day
and
the
woman
wiped
with
her
apron
the
perspiration
from
her
glowing
face
no
i
wo
pay
ten
cents
said
the
lady
coldly
i
give
you
forty
cents
for
five
boxes
and
nothing
more
but
madam
they
cost
me
within
a
trifle
of
eight
cents
a
box
i
ca
help
that
you
paid
too
much
for
them
and
this
must
be
your
loss
not
mine
if
i
buy
your
strawberries
i
never
pay
for
other
people
mistakes
i
understand
the
use
of
money
much
better
than
that
the
poor
woman
did
not
feel
very
well
the
day
was
unusually
hot
and
sultry
and
her
tray
felt
heavier
and
tired
her
more
than
usual
five
boxes
would
lighten
it
and
if
she
sold
her
berries
at
eight
cents
she
would
clear
two
cents
and
a
half
and
that
would
be
better
than
nothing
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
she
said
after
thinking
a
few
moments
i
do
feel
as
well
as
usual
and
my
tray
is
heavy
five
boxes
sold
will
be
something
you
shall
have
them
at
nine
cents
they
cost
me
seven
and
a
half
and
i
sure
it
worth
a
cent
and
a
half
a
box
to
cry
them
about
the
streets
such
hot
weather
as
this
i
have
told
you
my
good
woman
exactly
what
i
will
do
said
the
customer
with
dignity
if
you
are
willing
to
take
what
i
offer
you
say
so
if
not
we
need
stand
here
any
longer
well
i
suppose
you
will
have
to
take
them
replied
the
seeing
that
there
was
no
hope
of
doing
better
but
it
too
little
it
enough
said
the
lady
as
she
turned
to
call
a
servant
five
boxes
of
fine
large
strawberries
were
received
and
forty
cents
paid
for
them
the
lady
the
parlor
pleased
at
her
good
bargain
while
the
poor
woman
turned
from
the
door
sad
and
disheartened
she
walked
nearly
the
distance
of
a
square
before
she
could
trust
her
voice
to
utter
her
monotonous
cry
of
an
hour
afterward
a
friend
called
upon
mier
the
lady
who
had
bought
the
strawberries
after
talking
about
various
matters
and
things
interesting
to
lady
housekeepers
mier
said
how
much
did
you
pay
for
strawberries
this
morning
ten
cents
you
paid
too
much
i
bought
them
for
eight
for
eight
were
they
good
ones
step
into
the
and
i
will
show
them
to
you
the
ladies
stepped
into
the
when
mier
displayed
her
large
red
berries
which
were
really
much
finer
than
she
had
at
first
supposed
them
to
be
you
did
get
them
for
eight
cents
remarked
the
visitor
incredulously
yes
i
did
i
paid
forty
cents
for
five
boxes
while
i
paid
fifty
for
some
not
near
so
good
i
suppose
you
paid
just
what
you
were
asked
yes
i
always
do
that
i
buy
from
one
woman
during
the
season
who
agrees
to
furnish
me
at
the
regular
market
price
which
you
will
always
find
to
be
two
or
three
cents
above
what
you
can
get
them
for
in
the
market
you
always
buy
in
market
i
bought
these
from
a
woman
at
the
door
did
she
only
ask
eight
cents
for
them
oh
no
she
asked
ten
cents
and
pretended
that
she
got
twelve
and
a
half
for
the
same
quality
of
berries
yesterday
but
i
never
give
these
people
what
they
ask
while
i
never
can
find
it
in
my
heart
to
ask
a
poor
woman
at
my
door
to
take
a
cent
less
for
her
fruit
than
she
asks
me
a
cent
or
two
while
it
is
of
little
account
to
me
must
be
of
great
importance
to
her
you
are
a
very
poor
economist
i
see
said
mier
if
that
is
the
way
you
deal
with
every
one
your
husband
no
doubt
finds
his
expense
account
a
very
serious
item
i
do
know
about
that
he
never
complains
he
allows
me
a
certain
sum
every
week
to
keep
the
house
and
find
my
own
and
the
clothes
and
so
far
from
ever
calling
on
him
for
more
i
always
have
fifty
or
a
hundred
dollars
lying
by
me
you
must
have
a
precious
large
allowance
then
considering
your
want
of
economy
in
paying
everybody
just
what
they
ask
for
their
things
oh
no
i
do
do
that
exactly
mier
if
i
consider
the
price
of
a
thing
too
high
i
do
buy
it
you
paid
too
high
for
your
strawberries
today
perhaps
i
did
although
i
am
by
no
means
certain
you
can
judge
for
yourself
mine
cost
but
eight
cents
and
you
own
that
they
are
superior
to
yours
at
ten
cents
still
yours
may
have
been
too
cheap
instead
of
mine
too
dear
too
cheap
that
is
funny
i
never
saw
any
thing
too
cheap
in
my
life
the
great
trouble
is
that
every
thing
is
too
dear
what
do
you
mean
by
too
cheap
the
person
who
sold
them
to
you
may
not
have
made
profit
enough
upon
them
to
pay
for
her
time
and
labor
if
this
were
the
case
she
sold
them
to
you
too
cheap
suppose
she
paid
too
high
for
them
is
the
purchaser
to
pay
for
her
error
whether
she
did
so
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
and
even
if
she
had
made
such
a
mistake
i
think
it
would
be
more
just
and
humane
to
pay
her
a
price
that
would
give
her
a
fair
profit
instead
of
taking
from
her
the
means
of
buying
bread
for
her
children
at
least
this
is
my
way
of
reasoning
and
a
precious
lot
of
money
it
must
take
to
support
such
a
system
of
reasoning
but
how
much
pray
do
you
have
a
week
to
keep
the
family
i
am
curious
to
know
dollars
dollars
you
are
jesting
oh
no
that
is
exactly
what
i
receive
and
as
i
have
said
i
find
the
sum
ample
while
i
receive
fifty
dollars
a
week
said
mier
and
am
forever
calling
on
my
husband
to
settle
some
bill
or
other
for
me
and
yet
i
never
pay
the
exorbitant
prices
asked
by
everybody
for
every
thing
i
am
strictly
economical
in
my
family
while
other
people
pay
their
domestics
a
dollar
and
a
half
and
two
dollars
a
week
i
give
but
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
each
to
my
cook
and
chambermaid
and
require
the
chamber
maid
to
help
the
on
mondays
nothing
is
wasted
in
my
kitchen
for
i
take
care
in
marketing
not
to
allow
room
for
waste
i
do
know
how
it
is
that
you
save
money
on
dollars
with
your
system
while
i
find
fifty
dollars
inadequate
with
my
system
the
exact
difference
in
the
two
systems
will
be
clearly
understood
by
the
reader
when
he
is
informed
that
although
mier
never
paid
any
body
as
much
as
was
at
first
asked
for
an
article
and
was
always
talking
about
economy
and
trying
to
practice
it
by
withholding
from
others
what
was
justly
their
due
as
in
the
case
of
the
yet
she
was
a
very
extravagant
person
and
spared
no
money
in
gratifying
her
own
pride
gilman
her
visitor
was
on
the
contrary
really
economical
because
she
was
moderate
in
all
her
desires
and
was
usually
as
well
satisfied
with
an
article
of
dress
or
furniture
that
cost
ten
or
twenty
dollars
as
mier
was
with
one
that
cost
forty
or
fifty
dollars
in
little
things
the
former
was
not
so
particular
as
to
infringe
the
rights
of
others
while
in
larger
matters
she
was
careful
not
to
run
into
extravagance
in
order
to
gratify
her
own
or
children
pride
and
vanity
while
the
latter
pursued
a
course
directly
opposite
gilman
was
not
as
much
dissatisfied
on
reflection
about
the
price
she
had
paid
for
her
strawberries
as
she
had
felt
at
first
i
would
rather
pay
these
poor
creatures
two
cents
a
box
too
much
than
too
little
she
said
to
herself
dear
knows
they
earn
their
money
hard
enough
and
get
but
a
scanty
portion
after
all
although
the
tray
of
the
poor
when
she
passed
from
the
presence
of
mier
was
lighter
by
five
boxes
her
heart
was
heavier
and
that
made
her
steps
more
weary
than
before
the
next
place
at
which
she
stopped
she
found
the
same
disposition
to
beat
her
down
in
her
price
i
give
you
nine
cents
and
take
four
boxes
said
the
lady
indeed
madam
that
is
too
little
replied
the
woman
ten
cents
is
the
lowest
at
which
i
can
sell
them
and
make
even
a
reasonable
profit
well
say
and
a
half
for
four
boxes
and
i
will
take
them
it
is
only
two
cents
and
a
half
less
than
you
ask
for
them
give
me
a
fip
ma
there
comes
the
exclaimed
a
little
fellow
pressing
up
to
the
side
of
the
lady
quick
ma
here
calling
after
an
old
man
with
a
tin
cylinder
under
his
arm
that
looked
something
like
an
ice
cream
freezer
the
lady
drew
out
her
purse
and
searched
among
its
contents
for
the
small
coin
her
child
wanted
i
hav
any
thing
less
than
a
levy
she
at
length
said
oh
well
he
can
change
it
you
can
change
a
levy
by
this
time
the
stood
smiling
beside
the
as
he
was
counting
out
the
fip
worth
of
candy
the
child
spoke
up
in
an
earnest
voice
and
said
get
a
levy
worth
mother
do
wont
you
cousin
lu
coming
to
see
us
let
him
have
a
levy
worth
he
such
a
rogue
i
resist
him
responded
the
mother
the
candy
was
counted
out
and
the
levy
paid
when
the
man
retired
in
his
usual
good
humor
shall
i
take
these
strawberries
for
and
a
half
cents
said
the
lady
the
smile
fading
from
her
face
it
is
all
i
am
willing
to
give
if
you
wont
pay
any
more
i
mus
stand
for
two
cents
and
a
half
replied
the
woman
although
they
would
nearly
buy
a
loaf
of
bread
for
the
children
she
mentally
added
the
four
boxes
were
sold
for
the
sum
offered
and
the
woman
lifted
the
tray
upon
her
head
and
moved
on
again
the
sun
shone
out
still
hotter
and
hotter
as
the
day
advanced
large
beads
of
perspiration
rolled
from
the
throbbing
temples
of
the
as
she
passed
wearily
up
one
street
and
down
another
crying
her
fruit
at
the
top
of
her
voice
at
length
all
were
sold
but
five
boxes
and
now
it
was
past
one
long
before
this
she
ought
to
have
been
at
home
faint
from
she
lifted
her
tray
from
her
head
and
placing
it
upon
a
sat
down
to
rest
as
she
sat
thus
a
lady
came
up
and
paused
at
the
door
of
the
house
as
if
about
to
enter
you
look
tired
my
good
woman
she
said
kindly
this
is
a
very
hot
day
for
such
hard
work
as
yours
how
do
you
sell
your
strawberries
i
ought
to
have
ten
cents
for
them
but
nobody
seems
willing
to
give
ten
cents
although
they
are
very
fine
and
cost
me
as
much
as
some
i
have
got
twelve
and
a
half
for
how
many
boxes
have
you
five
they
are
very
fine
sure
enough
said
the
lady
stooping
down
and
examining
them
and
well
worth
ten
cents
i
take
them
thanky
i
was
afraid
i
should
have
to
take
them
home
said
the
woman
her
heart
bounding
up
lightly
the
lady
rung
the
bell
for
it
was
at
her
door
that
the
tired
had
stopped
to
rest
herself
while
she
was
waiting
for
the
door
to
be
opened
the
lady
took
from
her
purse
the
money
for
the
strawberries
and
handing
it
to
the
woman
said
here
is
your
money
shall
i
tell
the
servant
to
bring
you
out
a
glass
of
cool
water
you
are
hot
and
tired
if
you
please
said
the
woman
with
a
grateful
look
the
water
was
sent
out
by
the
servant
who
was
to
receive
the
strawberries
and
the
tired
woman
drank
it
eagerly
its
refreshing
coolness
flowed
through
every
vein
and
when
she
took
up
her
tray
to
return
home
both
heart
and
step
were
lighter
the
lady
whose
benevolent
feelings
had
prompted
her
to
the
performance
of
this
little
act
of
kindness
could
not
help
remembering
the
woman
grateful
look
she
had
not
done
much
not
more
than
it
was
every
one
duty
to
do
but
the
recollection
of
even
that
was
pleasant
far
more
pleasant
than
could
possibly
have
been
mier
at
having
saved
ten
cents
on
her
purchase
of
five
boxes
of
strawberries
notwithstanding
the
assurance
of
the
poor
woman
who
vended
them
that
at
the
reduced
rate
her
profit
on
the
whole
would
only
be
two
cents
and
a
half
after
dinner
mier
went
out
and
spent
thirty
dollars
in
purchasing
jewelry
for
her
eldest
daughter
a
young
lady
not
yet
eighteen
years
of
age
that
evening
at
the
the
strawberries
were
highly
commended
as
being
the
largest
and
most
delicious
in
flavor
of
any
they
had
yet
had
in
reply
to
which
mier
stated
with
an
air
of
peculiar
satisfaction
that
she
had
got
them
for
eight
cents
a
box
when
they
were
worth
at
least
ten
cents
the
woman
asked
me
ten
cents
she
said
but
i
offered
her
eight
and
she
took
them
while
the
family
of
mier
were
enjoying
their
pleasant
repast
the
sat
at
a
small
table
around
which
were
gathered
three
young
children
the
oldest
but
six
years
of
age
she
had
started
out
in
the
morning
with
thirty
boxes
of
strawberries
for
which
she
was
to
pay
seven
and
a
half
cents
a
box
if
all
had
brought
the
ten
cents
a
box
she
would
have
made
cents
but
such
was
not
the
case
rich
ladies
had
beaten
her
down
in
her
price
had
chaffered
with
her
for
the
few
pennies
of
profits
to
which
her
hard
labor
entitled
her
and
actually
robbed
her
of
the
meager
pittance
she
strove
to
earn
for
her
children
instead
of
realizing
the
small
sum
of
cents
she
had
cleared
only
cents
with
this
she
bought
a
little
indian
meal
and
molasses
for
her
own
and
her
children
supper
and
breakfast
as
she
sat
with
her
children
eating
the
only
food
she
was
able
to
provide
for
them
and
thought
of
what
had
occurred
during
the
day
a
feeling
of
bitterness
toward
her
kind
came
over
her
but
the
remembrance
of
the
kind
words
and
the
glass
of
cool
water
so
timely
and
thoughtfully
tendered
to
her
was
like
leaves
in
the
waters
of
marah
her
heart
softened
and
with
the
tears
stealing
to
her
eyes
she
glanced
upward
and
asked
a
blessing
on
her
who
had
remembered
that
though
poor
she
was
still
human
economy
is
a
good
thing
and
should
be
practiced
by
all
but
it
should
show
itself
in
denying
ourselves
not
in
oppressing
others
we
see
persons
spending
dollar
after
dollar
foolishly
one
hour
and
in
the
next
trying
to
save
a
five
penny
piece
off
of
a
or
such
things
are
disgraceful
if
not
dishonest
chapter

lots
of
things
o
dear
said
i
to
smith
one
morning
as
we
arose
from
the
at
which
we
had
been
partaking
of
rather
a
meal
more
trouble
in
prospect
what
the
matter
now
asked
smith
with
a
certain
emphasis
on
the
word
now
that
did
sound
just
agreeable
to
my
ears
oh
nothing
nothing
i
answered
with
as
much
indifference
of
manner
as
i
could
assume
you
spoke
of
trouble
said
he
kindly
and
trouble
in
my
experience
is
rather
more
tangible
than
i
another
raw
irish
girl
in
the
kitchen
who
according
to
her
own
confession
has
been
above
ten
days
in
the
country
that
enough
i
should
think
so
but
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
did
you
take
another
of
these
green
islanders
into
your
house
it
easy
enough
to
ask
questions
smith
said
i
a
little
fretfully
but
i
checked
myself
we
looked
at
each
other
smiled
and
said
no
more
on
the
subject
your
name
is
anna
i
believe
said
i
as
i
stepped
to
the
a
couple
of
hours
afterwards
thot

the
new
domestic
i
will
send

loin

i

smith
is
a
punctual
man
anna
was
profuse
in
her
promises
if
said
i
recollecting
myself
as
i
was
about
opening
the
street
door
and
returning
along
the
passage
if
any
thing
is
sent
home
for
me
be
sure
to
take
it
up
stairs
and
lay
it
carefully
on
my
bed

forget
this
anna
och
niver

a
hate
mum
was
the
girl
answer
i
not
forget
a
word
iv
insthructions
i
turned
away
and
left
the
house
my
principal
errand
was
a
visit
to
the
milliner
where
i
wished
to
see
a
bonnet
i
had
ordered
before
it
was
sent
home
it
was
this
bonnet
i
referred
to
when
i
desired
anna
to
place
carefully
on
the
bed
in
my
chamber
any
thing
that
might
come
home
on
my
way
to
the
milliner
i
stopped
at
the
grocer
where
we
were
in
the
habit
of
dealing
and
made
selections
of
various
things
that
were
needed
the
bonnet
proved
just
to
my
taste
it
was
a
delicate
white
spring
bonnet
with
a
neat
trimming
and
pleased
my
fancy
wonderfully
the
very
thing
said
i
the
moment
my
eyes
rested
upon
it
do
you
want
a
box
asked
the
milliner
after
i
had
decided
to
take
the
bonnet
i
have
one
was
my
answer
o
very
well
i
will
send
the
bonnet
home
in
a
box
and
you
can
take
it
out
that
will
do
shall
i
send
it
home
this
morning
if
you
please
very
well
i
see
that
it
is
done
after
this
i
made
a
number
of
calls
which
occupied
me
until
after
one
when
i
turned
my
face
homeward
on
arriving
i
was
admitted
by
my
new
girl
and
as
the
thought
of
my
beautiful
bonnet
now
returned
to
my
mind
my
first
words
were
has
any
thing
been
sent
home
for
me
anna
och
yis
indade
mum
was
her
answer
lots
o
things
lots
of
things
said
i
with
manifest
surprise
for
i
only
remembered
at
the
moment
my
direction
to
the
milliner
to
send
home
my
bonnet
yis
indade
responded
the
girl
lots
and
the
mon
brought
on
the
funniest
whale
barry
ye
iver
seed
on
a
wheel
barrow
yis
and
such
a
whale
barry
it
had
a
whale
on
each
side
as
i
a
livin
sinner

and
a
cunnin
little

cocked
up
intil

same
in
ireland
me
leddy
and
what
did
you
do
with
the
lots
of
things
brought
on
this
wheel
barrow
said
i
now
beginning
to
comprehend
the
girl
put
them
on
bed
sure
on
my
bed
i
exclaimed
in
consternation
sure
and
did
i
remember
the
last
words
ye
spake
till
me
says
ye
if
ony
thing
is
sent
home
for
me
be
sure
till
take
it
carefully
up
stairs
and
lay
it
on
me
bed
and
i
did
thot
same
sure
i
could
have
found
a
nicer
place
if
i
gone
the
house
over
turning
from
the
girl
i
hurried
up
stairs
it
was
as
i
had
too
good
reason
to
fear
such
a
sight
as
met
my
eyes
in
the
centre
of
my
bed
with
its
marseilles
covering
were
piled
lots
of
things
and
no
mistake
sugar
tea
cheese
coffee
soap
and
various
other
articles
not
excepting
a
bottle
of
olive
oil
from
the
started
cork
of
which
was
gently
oozing
a
slender
stream
lay
in
a
jumbled
heap
while
on
a
satin
chair
reposed
a
greasy
ham
for
a
moment
i
stood
confounded
then
giving
the
bell
a
violent
jerk
i
awaited
in
angry
impatience
the
appearance
of
anna
who
in
due
time
after
going
to
the
street
door
found
her
way
to
my
chamber
anna
i
exclaimed
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
possessed
you
to
do
this
and
i
pointed
to
the
bed
sure
and
ye
towld
me
till
put
them
on
ye
bed
i
told
you
no
such
thing
you
stupid
creature
i
said
if
a
bonnet
came
to
put
it
on
the
bed
och
sorry
a
word
did
ye
iver
say
about
a
bonnet
mum
it
the
first
time
i
iver
heard
ony
thing
about
a
bonnet
from
yer
blessed
lips
and
thot
thrue
where
is
my
bonnet
then
did
one
come
home
plase
mum
and
there
did
and
a
purty
one
it
is
too
as
iver
my
two
eyes
looked
upon
what
did
you
do
with
it
i
enquired
with
a
good
deal
of
concern
it
safe
in
thot
great
mahogany
closet
mum
she
replied
pointing
to
my
wardrobe
i
stepped
quickly
to
the
mahogany
closet
and
threw
open
the
door
alas
for
my
poor
bonnet
it
was
crushed
in
between
two
of
smith
coats
and
tied
to
a
peg
by
the
strings
which
were
of
course
crumpled
to
a
degree
that
made
them
useless
too
bad
too
bad
i
murmured
as
i
disengaged
the
bonnet
from
its
unhappy
companionship
with
broadcloth
as
it
came
to
the
light
my
eyes
fell
upon
two
dark
spots
on
the
front
the
unmistakable
prints
of
anna
greasy
fingers
this
was
too
much
i
tossed
it
in
a
moment
of
passion
upon
the
bed
where
in
contact
with
the
lots
of
things
it
received
its
final
touch
of
ruin
from
a
portion
of
the
oozing
contents
of
the
sweet
oil
bottle
of
the
scene
that
followed
and
of
the
late
dinner
to
which
my
husband
was
introduced
an
hour
afterwards
i
will
not
trust
myself
to
write
i
was
not
of
course
in
a
very
agreeable
humor
and
the
record
of
what
i
said
and
did
and
of
how
i
looked
would
be
in
no
way
flattering
to
my
own
good
opinion
of
myself
nor
prove
particularly
edifying
to
the
reader
i
shall
never
forget
anna
new
variety
of
nor
the
lots
o
things
she
deposited
on
my
bed
she
lived
with
me
just
seven
days
and
then
made
way
for
another
a
little
more
tolerable
than
herself
chapter
xx
a
cure
for
low
spirits
from
some
cause
real
or
imaginary
i
felt
low
spirited
there
was
a
cloud
upon
my
feelings
and
i
could
not
smile
as
usual
nor
speak
in
a
tone
of
cheerfulness
as
a
natural
result
the
light
of
my
countenance
being
gone
all
things
around
me
were
in
a
shadow
my
husband
was
sober
and
had
but
little
to
say
the
children
would
look
strangely
at
me
when
i
answered
their
questions
or
spoke
to
them
for
any
purpose
and
the
domestics
moved
about
in
a
quiet
manner
and
when
they
addressed
me
did
so
in
a
tone
more
subdued
than
usual
this
reaction
upon
my
state
only
made
darker
the
clouds
that
veiled
my
spirits
i
was
conscious
of
this
and
was
conscious
that
the
original
cause
of
depression
was
entirely
inadequate
in
itself
to
produce
the
result
which
had
followed
under
this
feeling
i
made
an
effort
to
rally
myself
but
in
vain
and
sank
lower
from
the
struggle
to
rise
above
the
gloom
that
overshadowed
me
when
my
husband
came
home
at
dinner
time
i
tried
to
meet
him
with
a
smile
but
i
felt
that
the
light
upon
my
countenance
was
feeble
and
of
brief
duration
he
looked
at
me
earnestly
and
in
his
kind
and
gentle
way
enquired
if
i
felt
no
better
affecting
to
believe
that
my
ailment
was
one
of
the
body
instead
of
the
mind
but
i
scarcely
answered
him
and
i
could
see
that
he
felt
hurt
how
much
more
wretched
did
i
become
at
this
could
i
have
then
retired
to
my
chamber
and
alone
given
my
heart
full
vent
in
a
passion
of
tears
i
might
have
obtained
relief
to
my
feelings
but
i
could
not
do
this
while
i
sat
at
the
table
forcing
a
little
food
into
my
mouth
for
appearance
sake
my
husband
said
you
remember
the
fine
lad
who
has
been
with
me
for
some
time
i
nodded
my
head
but
the
question
did
not
awaken
in
my
mind
the
least
interest
he
has
not
made
his
appearance
for
several
days
and
i
learned
this
morning
on
sending
to
the
house
of
his
mother
that
he
is
very
ah
was
my
indifferent
response
had
i
spoken
what
was
in
my
mind
i
would
have
said
i
sorry
but
i
ca
help
it
i
did
not
at
the
moment
feel
the
smallest
interest
in
the
lad
yes
added
my
husband
and
the
person
who
called
to
let
me
know
about
it
expressed
his
fears
that
edward
would
not
get
up
again
what
ails
him
i
enquired
i
did
not
clearly
understand
but
he
has
a
fever
of
some
kind
you
remember
his
mother
very
well
oh
yes
you
know
she
worked
for
me
edward
is
her
only
child
i
believe
yes
and
his
loss
to
her
will
be
almost
everything
is
he
dangerous
i
enquired
a
feeling
of
interest
beginning
to
stir
in
my
heart
he
is
not
expected
to
live
poor
woman
how
distressed
she
must
be
i
wonder
what
her
circumstances
are
just
at
this
time
she
seemed
very
poor
when
she
worked
for
me
and
she
is
very
poor
still
i
doubt
not
she
has
herself
been
sick
and
during
the
time
it
is
more
than
probable
that
edward
wages
were
all
her
income
i
am
afraid
she
has
not
now
the
means
of
procuring
for
her
sick
boy
things
necessary
for
his
comfort
could
you
not
go
around
there
this
afternoon
and
see
how
they
are
i
shook
my
head
instantly
at
this
proposition
for
sympathy
for
others
was
not
strong
enough
to
expel
my
selfish
despondency
of
mind
then
i
must
step
around
replied
my
husband
before
i
go
back
to
business
although
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
it
would
not
be
right
to
neglect
this
lad
and
his
mother
under
present
circumstances
i
felt
rebuked
at
these
words
and
with
an
effort
said
i
will
go
it
will
be
much
better
for
you
to
see
them
than
for
me
returned
my
husband
for
you
can
understand
their
wants
better
and
minister
to
them
more
effectually
if
they
need
any
comforts
i
would
like
to
have
you
see
them
supplied
it
still
cost
me
an
effort
to
get
ready
but
as
i
had
promised
to
do
as
my
husband
wished
the
effort
had
to
be
made
by
the
time
i
was
prepared
to
go
out
i
felt
something
better
the
exertion
i
was
required
to
make
tended
to
disperse
slightly
the
clouds
that
hung
over
me
and
as
they
began
gradually
to
remove
my
thoughts
turned
with
an
awakened
interest
towards
the
object
of
my
solicitude
all
was
silent
within
the
humble
abode
to
which
my
errand
led
me
i
knocked
lightly
and
in
a
few
moments
the
mother
of
edward
opened
the
door
she
looked
pale
and
anxious
how
is
your
son
mrs
ellis
i
enquired
as
i
stepped
in
he
is
very
low
she
replied
not
dangerous
i
hope
the
fever
has
left
him
but
he
is
as
weak
as
an
infant
all
his
strength
is
gone
but
proper
nourishment
will
restore
him
now
that
the
disease
is
broken
so
the
doctor
says
but
i
afraid
it
too
late
he
seems
to
be
sinking
every
hour
will
you
walk
up
and
see
him
i
followed
ellis
up
stairs
and
into
a
chamber
where
the
sick
boy
lay
i
was
not
surprised
at
the
fear
she
expressed
when
i
saw
edward
pale
sunken
face
and
hollow
almost
expressionless
eyes
he
scarcely
noticed
my
entrance
poor
boy
sighed
his
mother
he
has
had
a
very
sick
spell
my
liveliest
interest
was
at
once
awakened
he
has
been
sick
indeed
i
replied
as
i
laid
my
hand
upon
his
white
forehead
i
found
his
skin
cold
and
damp
the
fever
had
nearly
burned
out
the
vital
energy
of
his
system
do
you
give
him
much
nourishment
he
takes
a
little
has
not
the
doctor
ordered
wine
yes
replied
ellis
but
she
spoke
with
an
air
of
hesitation
he
says
a
spoonful
of
good
wine
three
or
four
times
a
day
would
be
very
good
for
him
and
you
have
not
given
him
any
no
we
have
some
very
pure
wine
that
we
always
keep
for
sickness
if
you
will
step
over
to
our
house
and
tell
alice
to
give
you
a
bottle
of
it
i
will
stay
with
edward
until
you
return
how
brightly
glowed
that
poor
woman
face
as
my
words
fell
upon
her
ears
o
you
are
very
kind
said
she
but
it
will
be
asking
too
much
of
you
to
stay
here
you
did
ask
it
ellis
i
simply
replied
i
have
offered
to
stay
so
do
you
go
for
the
wine
as
quickly
as
you
can
for
edward
needs
it
very
much
i
was
not
required
to
say
more
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
alone
with
the
sick
boy
who
lay
almost
as
still
as
if
death
were
resting
upon
his
to
some
extent
during
the
half
hour
i
remained
thus
in
that
hushed
chamber
did
i
realize
the
condition
and
feelings
of
the
poor
mother
whose
only
son
lay
gasping
at
the
very
door
of
death
and
all
my
sympathies
were
in
consequence
awakened
as
soon
as
ellis
returned
with
the
wine
about
a
teaspoonful
was
diluted
and
the
glass
containing
it
placed
to
the
sick
lips
the
moment
its
flavor
touched
his
palate
a
thrill
seemed
to
pass
through
his
frame
and
he
swallowed
eagerly
it
does
him
good
said
i
speaking
warmly
and
from
an
impulse
that
made
my
heart
glow
we
sat
and
looked
with
silent
interest
upon
the
boy
face
and
we
did
not
look
in
vain
for
something
like
warmth
came
upon
his
wan
cheeks
and
when
i
placed
my
hand
upon
his
forehead
the
coldness
and
dampness
were
gone
the
wine
had
quickened
his
languid
pulse
i
stayed
an
hour
longer
and
then
another
spoonful
of
the
generous
wine
was
given
its
effect
was
as
marked
as
the
first
i
then
withdrew
from
the
humble
home
of
the
widow
and
her
only
child
promising
to
see
them
again
in
the
morning
when
i
regained
the
street
and
my
thoughts
for
a
moment
reverted
to
myself
how
did
i
find
all
changed
the
clouds
had
been
dispersed
the
heavy
load
had
been
raised
from
my
bosom
i
walked
with
a
free
step
sympathy
for
others
and
active
efforts
to
do
others
good
had
expelled
the
evil
spirit
from
my
heart
and
now
serene
peace
had
there
again
her
quiet
habitation
there
was
light
in
every
part
of
my
dwelling
when
i
it
and
i
sung
cheerfully
as
i
prepared
with
my
own
hands
a
basket
of
provisions
for
the
poor
widow
when
my
husband
returned
again
in
the
evening
he
found
me
at
work
cheerfully
in
my
family
and
all
bright
and
smiling
again
the
efforts
to
do
good
to
others
had
driven
away
the
darkness
from
my
spirit
and
the
sunshine
was
again
on
my
countenance
and
reflected
from
every
member
of
my
household
chapter
xxi
a
bargain
i
am
not
much
of
a
having
had
like
most
housekeepers
sufficient
experience
on
that
subject
to
effect
a
pretty
thorough
cure
of
the
disease
mild
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
as
all
diseases
whether
bodily
or
mental
leave
behind
them
a
predisposition
to
return
i
have
from
time
to
time
been
subjected
to
slight
paroxisms
of
the
old
complaint
from
the
effects
of
my
last
rather
mild
attack
i
am
now
recovering
i
was
passing
along
walnut
street
on
my
way
to
drop
a
letter
in
the
post
office
one
morning
about
ten
when
the
ringing
of
an
auctioneer
bell
came
suddenly
on
my
ears
lifting
my
eyes
i
saw
the
flag
of
thomas
son
displayed
before
me
and
read
the
words
auction
this
morning
here
was
an
exciting
cause
as
the
doctors
say
and
instantly
i
felt
a
movement
of
the
old
affection
two
or
three
ladies
happened
to
be
entering
the
store
at
the
time
and
the
sudden
inclination
to
follow
them
was
so
strong
that
i
did
not
attempt
its
resistance
it
was
not
my
intention
to
buy
any
thing
of
course
for
i
was
conscious
of
no
particular
want
i
only
just
wished
if
any
wish
were
really
full
formed
to
see
what
was
to
be
sold
scarcely
had
i
entered
the
door
when
a
sofa
so
nearly
new
that
it
hardly
bore
a
mark
of
having
been
used
presented
itself
and
captivated
my
fancy
the
one
that
graced
our
parlor
had
grown
somewhat
out
of
fashion
it
was
in
good
keeping
but
rather
plain
in
style
and
as
we
had
recently
treated
ourselves
to
handsome
new
carpets
did
not
appear
to
quite
so
good
advantage
as
before
this
one
to
be
sold
at
auction
was
made
after
a
newer
pattern
and
as
my
eyes
continued
to
rest
upon
it
the
desires
to
have
it
in
my
parlor
was
fully
formed
i
have
said
that
on
entering
the
auction
store
i
was
unconscious
of
any
particular
want
this
was
true
notwithstanding
smith
and
i
had
a
few
days
before
called
at
a
cabinet
maker
wareroom
to
look
at
a
sofa
in
consequence
of
former
experience
in
cheap
furniture
we
had
no
thought
of
getting
a
article
from
a
second
or
third
rate
establishment
but
designed
when
we
did
purchase
to
act
wisely
and
get
the
best
we
had
been
looking
at
a
sofa
for
which
dollars
was
asked
and
were
hesitating
between
that
and
another
upon
which
fifty
dollars
was
set
as
the
price
it
was
but
natural
under
these
circumstances
that
i
should
look
upon
this
sofa
with
more
than
ordinary
interest
a
glance
told
me
that
it
was
an
article
of
superior
make
and
a
close
examination
fully
confirmed
this
impression
a
few
minutes
after
my
entrance
the
sale
begun
and
it
so
happened
that
the
sofa
came
first
on
the
list
we
shall
begin
this
morning
said
the
auctioneer
with
a
superior
fashionable
sofa
made
by
it
has
only
been
in
use
a
short
time
and
is
in
every
respect
equal
to
new
all
my
predilections
in
favor
of
the
sofa
were
confirmed
the
moment
the
manufacturer
name
was
announced
of
course
it
was
of
the
best
material
and
workmanship
what
is
bid
for
this
superior
sofa
made
by
went
on
the
salesman
seventy
dollars
forty
thirty
dollars
said
a
timid
voice
cried
the
auctioneer
said
i
the
first
bidder
advanced
a
dollar
on
this
then
i
bid
he
went
up
to
and
i
made
it
thirty
at
which
offer
the
sofa
was
knocked
down
to
me
that
a
bargain
and
no
mistake
said
the
salesman
it
is
worth
fifty
dollars
if
it
worth
a
cent
i
give
you
five
dollars
advance
proposed
a
lady
by
my
side
who
had
desired
to
bid
but
could
not
bring
up
her
courage
to
the
point
no
thank
you
was
my
prompt
answer
i
was
too
well
pleased
with
my
bargain
when
smith
came
home
to
dinner
on
that
day
i
met
him
in
the
parlor
what
do
you
think
of
this
said
i
pointing
to
the
new
sofa
i
spoke
in
an
exultant
voice
where
in
the
world
did
it
come
from
enquired
smith
evincing
a
natural
surprise
i
bought
it
was
my
reply
when
where
this
morning
at
auction
at
auction
yes
and
it
a
bargain
now
guess
what
i
gave
for
it
ten
dollars
now
smith
but
come
be
serious
is
it
cheap
at
forty
dollars
smith
examined
the
sofa
with
care
and
then
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
it
was
dear
at
forty
dollars
i
got
it
for
thirty
said
i
indeed
i
should
really
call
that
a
bargain
provided
you
discover
in
it
after
a
while
some
defect
i
looked
at
every
part
over
and
over
again
was
my
response
to
this
and
can
find
a
defect
nowhere
none
exists
i
am
satisfied
time
will
show
remarked
smith
there
was
the
smallest
perceptible
doubt
in
his
tone
next
morning
on
going
into
my
parlors
i
was
a
little
worried
to
see
two
or
three
moths
flying
about
the
room
they
were
despatched
with
commendable
quickness
on
the
morning
that
followed
the
same
thing
occurred
again
and
this
was
repeated
morning
after
morning
moreover
in
a
few
days
these
insects
so
dreaded
by
housekeepers
showed
themselves
in
the
chambers
above
up
to
this
time
i
had
neglected
to
put
away
my
furs
a
new
set
of
which
had
been
purchased
during
the
previous
winter
i
delayed
this
no
longer
time
had
now
arrived
my
new
carpets
were
taken
up
and
packed
away
to
give
place
to
the
cooler
matting
our
winter
clothing
also
received
attention
and
was
deposited
in
chests
and
closets
for
the
summer
duly
provided
with
all
needful
protection
from
moths
after
this
came
the
calm
of
rest
and
one
day
about
the
middle
of
july
a
lady
friend
called
in
to
see
me
that
a
neat
sofa
smith
said
she
in
the
pause
of
a
conversation
i
think
it
very
neat
was
my
answer
it
made
from
the
same
pattern
with
one
that
i
had
one
that
i
always
liked
and
from
which
i
was
sorry
to
part
you
sold
it
said
i
yes
i
sent
it
to
auction
ah
why
so
i
discovered
this
spring
that
the
moth
had
got
into
it
indeed
yes
they
showed
themselves
every
day
in
such
numbers
in
my
parlors
that
i
became
alarmed
for
my
carpets
i
soon
traced
their
origin
to
the
sofa
which
was
immediately
packed
off
to
auction
i
was
sorry
to
part
with
it
but
there
was
no
other
effective
remedy
you
lost
on
the
sale
i
presume
i
ventured
to
remark
yes
that
was
to
be
expected
it
cost
sixty
dollars
and
brought
only
thirty
but
this
loss
was
to
be
preferred
to
the
destruction
such
an
army
of
moth
as
it
was
sending
forth
would
have
occasioned
i
changed
the
subject
dexterously
having
heard
quite
enough
about
the
sofa
to
satisfy
me
that
my
bargain
was
likely
to
prove
a
bad
one
all
the
summer
i
was
troubled
with
visions
of
carpets
furs
shawls
and
overcoats
and
they
proved
to
be
only
the
foreshadowing
of
real
things
to
come
for
when
in
the
fall
the
contents
of
old
chests
boxes
drawers
and
dark
closets
were
brought
forth
to
the
light
a
state
of
affairs
truly
frightful
to
a
housekeeper
was
presented
one
of
the
breadths
of
my
handsome
carpet
had
the
pile
so
eaten
off
in
conspicuous
places
that
no
remedy
was
left
but
the
purchase
and
substitution
of
a
new
one
at
a
cost
of
nearly
ten
dollars
in
dozens
of
places
the
texture
of
the
carpet
was
eaten
entirely
through
i
was
as
my
lady
readers
may
naturally
suppose
very
unhappy
at
this
but
the
evil
by
no
means
found
a
limit
here
on
opening
my
fur
boxes
i
found
that
the
work
of
destruction
had
been
going
on
there
also
a
single
shake
of
the
muff
threw
little
fibres
and
flakes
of
fur
in
no
stinted
measure
upon
the
air
and
on
dashing
my
hand
hard
against
it
a
larger
mass
was
detached
showing
the
skin
bare
and
white
beneath
my
furs
were
ruined
they
had
cost
seventy
dollars
and
were
not
worth
ten
a
still
further
examination
into
our
stock
of
winter
clothing
showed
that
the
work
of
destruction
had
extended
to
almost
every
article
scarcely
any
thing
had
escaped
troubled
worried
and
unhappy
as
i
was
i
yet
concealed
from
smith
the
origin
of
all
this
ruin
he
never
suspected
our
cheap
sofa
for
a
moment
after
i
had
by
slow
degrees
recovered
from
my
chagrin
and
disappointment
my
thoughts
turned
naturally
upon
a
disposition
of
the
sofa
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
as
to
keeping
it
over
another
season
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
but
would
it
be
right
i
asked
myself
to
send
it
back
to
auctions
and
let
it
thus
go
into
the
possession
of
some
housekeeper
as
ignorant
of
its
real
character
as
i
had
been
i
found
it
very
hard
to
reconcile
my
conscience
to
such
a
disposition
of
the
sofa
and
there
was
still
another
difficulty
in
the
way
what
excuse
for
parting
with
it
could
i
make
to
smith
he
had
never
suspected
that
article
to
be
the
origination
of
all
the
mischief
and
loss
we
had
sustained
winter
began
drawing
to
a
close
and
still
the
sofa
remained
in
its
place
and
still
was
i
in
perplexity
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
it
business
requires
me
to
go
to
charleston
said
smith
one
day
late
in
february
how
long
will
you
be
away
was
my
natural
enquiry
from
ten
days
to
two
weeks
replied
smith
so
long
as
that
it
will
hardly
be
possible
to
get
home
earlier
than
the
time
i
have
mentioned
you
go
in
the
osprey
yes
she
sails
day
after
so
you
will
have
all
ready
for
me
if
you
please
never
before
had
the
announcement
of
my
husband
that
he
had
to
go
away
on
business
given
me
pleasure
the
moment
he
said
that
he
would
be
absent
the
remedy
for
my
difficulty
suggested
itself
the
very
day
smith
sailed
in
the
steamer
for
charleston
i
sent
for
an
upholsterer
and
after
explaining
to
him
the
defect
connected
with
my
sofa
directed
him
to
have
the
seating
all
removed
and
then
replaced
by
new
materials
taking
particular
care
to
thoroughly
cleanse
the
inside
of
the
wood
work
lest
the
vestige
of
a
moth
should
be
left
remaining
all
this
was
done
at
a
cost
of
twenty
dollars
when
smith
returned
the
sofa
was
back
in
its
place
and
he
was
none
the
wiser
for
the
change
until
some
months
afterwards
when
unable
to
keep
the
secret
any
longer
i
told
him
the
whole
story
i
am
pretty
well
cured
i
think
now
of
chapter
xxii
a
peevish
day
and
its
consequences
there
are
few
housekeepers
who
have
not
had
their
sick
and
peevish
days
i
have
had
mine
as
the
reader
will
see
by
the
following
story
which
i
some
time
since
ventured
to
relate
in
the
third
person
and
which
i
now
take
the
liberty
of
introducing
into
these
confessions
it
is
too
bad
rachel
to
put
me
to
all
this
trouble
and
you
know
i
can
hardly
hold
up
my
head
thus
spoke
smith
in
a
peevish
voice
to
a
quiet
looking
domestic
who
had
been
called
up
from
the
kitchen
to
supply
some
unimportant
omission
in
the
breakfast
table
arrangement
rachel
looked
hurt
and
rebuked
but
made
no
reply
how
could
you
speak
in
that
way
to
rachel
said
smith
as
soon
as
the
domestic
had
withdrawn
if
you
felt
just
as
i
do
smith
you
would
speak
cross
too
smith
replied
a
little
warmly
i
feel
just
like
a
rag
and
my
head
aches
as
if
it
would
burst
i
know
you
feel
badly
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
but
still
i
suppose
it
is
as
easy
to
speak
kindly
as
harshly
rachel
is
very
obliging
and
attentive
and
should
be
borne
with
in
occasional
omissions
which
you
of
course
know
are
not
wilful
it
is
easy
enough
to
preach
retorted
smith
whose
temper
from
bodily
lassitude
and
pain
was
in
quite
an
irritable
state
the
reader
will
understand
at
least
one
of
the
reasons
of
this
when
he
is
told
that
the
scene
here
presented
occurred
during
the
last
oppressive
week
in
august
smith
said
no
more
he
saw
that
to
do
so
would
only
be
to
provoke
instead
of
quieting
his
wife
ill
humor
the
morning
meal
went
by
in
silence
but
little
food
passing
the
lips
of
either
how
could
it
when
the
thermometer
was
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
the
leaves
upon
the
trees
were
as
motionless
as
if
suspended
in
a
vacuum
bodies
and
minds
were
relaxed
and
the
one
turned
from
food
as
the
other
did
from
thought
with
an
instinctive
aversion
after
smith
had
left
his
home
for
his
place
of
business
smith
went
up
into
her
chamber
and
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
her
head
still
continuing
to
ache
with
great
violence
it
so
happened
that
a
week
before
the
chambermaid
had
gone
away
sick
and
all
the
duties
of
the
household
had
in
consequence
devolved
upon
rachel
herself
not
very
well
cheerfully
however
had
she
endeavored
to
discharge
these
accumulated
duties
and
but
for
the
unhappy
peevish
state
of
mind
in
which
smith
indulged
would
have
discharged
them
without
a
murmuring
thought
but
as
she
was
a
faithful
conscientious
woman
and
withal
sensitive
in
her
feelings
to
be
found
fault
with
worried
her
exceedingly
of
this
smith
was
well
aware
and
had
until
the
latter
part
of
the
trying
month
of
august
acted
towards
rachel
with
consideration
and
forbearance
but
the
last
week
of
august
was
too
much
for
her
the
sickness
of
the
chamber
maid
threw
such
heavy
duties
upon
rachel
whose
daily
headaches
and
nervous
relaxation
of
body
were
borne
without
a
complaint
that
their
perfect
performance
was
almost
impossible
slight
omissions
which
were
next
to
unavoidable
under
the
circumstances
became
so
annoying
to
smith
herself
as
it
has
been
seen
laboring
under
great
bodily
and
mental
prostration
that
she
could
not
bear
them
she
knows
better
and
she
could
do
better
if
she
chose
was
her
rather
uncharitable
comment
often
inwardly
made
on
the
occurrence
of
some
new
trouble
after
smith
had
taken
his
departure
on
the
morning
just
referred
to
smith
went
up
into
her
chamber
as
has
been
seen
and
threw
herself
languidly
upon
a
bed
pressing
her
hands
to
her
throbbing
temples
as
she
did
so
and
murmuring
i
ca
live
at
this
rate
at
the
same
time
rachel
sat
down
in
the
kitchen
the
large
waiter
upon
which
she
had
arranged
the
dishes
from
the
breakfast
table
and
then
sinking
into
a
chair
pressed
one
hand
upon
her
forehead
and
sat
for
more
than
a
minute
in
troubled
silence
it
had
been
three
days
since
she
had
received
from
smith
a
pleasant
word
and
the
last
remark
made
to
her
a
short
time
before
had
been
the
unkindest
of
all
at
another
time
even
all
this
would
not
have
moved
her
she
could
have
perceived
that
smith
was
not
in
a
right
state
that
lassitude
of
body
had
produced
a
temporary
infirmity
of
mind
but
being
herself
affected
by
the
oppressive
season
almost
as
much
as
her
mistress
she
could
not
make
these
allowances
while
still
seated
the
chamber
bell
was
rung
with
a
quick
startling
jerk
what
next
peevishly
ejaculated
rachel
and
then
slowly
proceeded
to
obey
the
summons
how
could
you
leave
my
chamber
in
such
a
condition
as
this
was
the
salutation
that
met
her
ear
as
she
entered
the
presence
of
smith
who
half
raised
upon
the
bed
and
leaning
upon
her
hand
looked
the
very
personification
of
languor
peevishness
and
you
had
plenty
of
time
while
we
were
eating
breakfast
to
have
put
things
a
little
to
rights
to
this
rachel
made
no
reply
but
turned
away
and
went
back
into
the
kitchen
she
had
scarcely
reached
that
spot
before
the
bell
rang
again
louder
and
quicker
than
before
but
she
did
not
answer
it
in
about
three
minutes
it
was
jerked
with
an
energy
that
snapped
the
wire
but
rachel
was
immovable
five
minutes
elapsed
and
then
smith
fully
aroused
from
the
lethargy
that
had
stolen
over
her
came
down
with
a
quick
firm
step
what
the
reason
you
did
answer
my
bell
say
she
asked
in
an
excited
voice
rachel
did
not
reply
do
you
hear
me
rachel
had
never
been
so
treated
before
she
had
lived
with
smith
for
three
years
and
had
rarely
been
found
fault
with
she
had
been
too
strict
in
regard
to
the
performance
of
her
duty
to
leave
much
room
for
even
a
more
exacting
mistress
to
find
fault
but
now
to
be
overtasked
and
sick
and
to
be
chidden
rebuked
and
even
angrily
assailed
was
more
than
she
could
well
bear
she
did
not
suffer
herself
to
speak
for
some
moments
and
then
her
voice
trembled
and
the
tears
came
out
upon
her
cheeks
i
wish
you
to
get
another
in
my
place
i
find
i
do
suit
you
my
time
will
be
up
day
after
very
well
was
smith
firm
reply
as
she
turned
away
and
left
the
kitchen
here
was
trouble
in
good
earnest
often
and
often
had
smith
said
during
the
past
two
or
three
years
what
should
i
do
without
rachel
and
now
she
had
given
notice
that
she
was
going
to
leave
her
and
under
circumstances
which
made
pride
forbid
a
request
to
stay
determined
to
act
out
her
part
of
the
business
with
firmness
and
decision
she
dressed
herself
and
went
out
hot
and
oppressive
as
it
was
and
took
her
way
to
an
intelligence
office
where
she
paid
the
required
fee
and
directed
a
cook
and
chamber
maid
to
be
sent
to
her
on
the
next
morning
about
ten
an
irish
girl
came
and
offered
herself
as
a
cook
and
was
after
sundry
questions
and
answers
engaged
so
soon
as
this
negotiation
was
settled
rachel
retired
from
the
kitchen
leaving
the
in
full
possession
in
half
an
hour
after
she
received
her
wages
and
left
in
no
very
happy
frame
of
mind
a
home
that
had
been
for
three
years
until
within
a
few
days
a
pleasant
one
as
for
smith
she
was
ready
to
go
to
bed
sick
but
this
was
impracticable
nancy
the
new
cook
had
expressly
stipulated
that
she
was
to
have
no
duties
unconnected
with
the
kitchen
the
consequence
was
that
notwithstanding
the
thermometer
ranged
above
ninety
and
the
atmosphere
remained
as
sultry
as
air
from
a
heated
oven
smith
was
compelled
to
arrange
her
chamber
and
parlors
by
the
time
this
was
done
she
was
in
a
condition
to
go
to
bed
and
lie
until
dinner
time
the
arrival
of
this
important
period
brought
new
troubles
and
vexations
dinner
was
late
by
forty
minutes
and
then
came
on
the
table
in
a
most
abominable
condition
a
fine
sirloin
was
burnt
to
a
crisp
the
tomatoes
were
smoked
and
the
potatoes
watery
as
if
this
were
not
enough
to
mar
the
pleasure
of
the
dinner
hour
for
a
hungry
husband
smith
added
thereto
a
distressed
countenance
and
discouraging
complaints
nancy
was
grumbled
at
and
scolded
every
time
she
had
occasion
to
appear
in
the
room
and
her
single
attempt
to
excuse
herself
on
account
of
not
understanding
the
cook
stove
was
met
by
do
hush
will
you
i
out
of
all
patience
as
to
the
latter
part
of
the
sentence
that
was
a
needless
waste
of
words
the
condition
of
mind
she
described
was
fully
apparent
about
three
in
the
afternoon
just
as
smith
had
found
a
temporary
relief
from
a
troubled
mind
and
a
most
intolerable
headache
in
sleep
a
tap
on
the
chamber
door
awoke
her
there
stood
nancy
all
equipped
for
going
out
i
find
i
wo
suit
you
said
nancy
and
so
you
must
look
out
for
another
girl
having
said
this
she
turned
away
and
took
her
departure
leaving
smith
in
a
state
of
mind
as
it
is
said
more
easily
imagined
than
described
o
dear
what
shall
i
do
at
length
broke
from
her
lips
as
she
burst
into
tears
and
burying
her
face
in
the
pillow
sobbed
aloud
already
she
had
repented
of
her
fretfulness
and
temper
as
displayed
towards
rachel
and
could
she
have
made
a
truce
with
pride
or
silenced
its
whispers
would
have
sent
for
her
domestic
and
endeavored
to
make
all
fair
with
her
again
but
under
the
circumstances
this
was
now
impossible
while
yet
undetermined
how
to
act
the
street
bell
rung
and
she
was
compelled
to
attend
the
door
as
she
was
now
alone
in
the
house
she
found
on
opening
it
a
country
girl
who
asked
if
she
were
the
lady
who
wanted
a
chamber
maid
any
kind
of
help
was
better
than
none
at
all
and
so
smith
asked
the
young
woman
to
walk
in
in
treating
with
her
in
regard
to
her
qualifications
for
the
situation
she
applied
for
she
discovered
that
she
knew
almost
nothing
at
all
about
any
thing
the
stipulation
that
she
was
to
be
a
until
a
cook
could
be
obtained
was
readily
agreed
to
and
then
she
was
shown
to
her
room
in
the
attic
where
she
prepared
herself
for
entering
upon
her
duties
will
you
please
show
me
what
you
want
me
to
do
asked
the
new
help
presenting
herself
before
smith
go
into
the
kitchen
ellen
and
see
that
the
fire
is
made
i
be
down
there
presently
to
be
compelled
to
see
after
a
new
and
ignorant
servant
and
direct
her
in
every
thing
just
at
so
trying
a
season
of
the
year
and
while
her
mind
was
all
out
of
sorts
was
a
severe
task
for
poor
smith
she
found
that
ellen
as
she
had
too
good
reason
for
believing
was
totally
unacquainted
with
kitchen
work
she
did
not
even
know
how
to
kindle
a
coal
fire
nor
could
she
manage
the
stove
after
smith
had
made
the
fire
for
her
all
this
did
not
in
any
way
tend
to
make
her
less
unhappy
or
more
patient
than
before
on
retiring
for
the
night
she
had
a
high
fever
which
continued
unabated
until
morning
when
her
husband
found
her
really
ill
so
much
so
as
to
make
the
attendance
of
a
doctor
necessary
a
change
in
the
air
had
taken
place
during
the
night
and
the
temperature
had
fallen
many
degrees
this
aided
the
efforts
of
the
physician
and
enabled
him
so
to
adapt
his
remedies
as
to
speedily
break
the
fever
but
the
ignorance
and
awkwardness
of
ellen
apparent
in
her
attempts
to
arrange
her
bed
and
chamber
so
worried
her
mind
that
she
was
near
relapsing
into
her
former
feverish
and
excited
state
the
attendance
of
an
elder
maiden
sister
was
just
in
time
all
care
was
taken
from
her
thoughts
and
she
had
a
chance
of
recovering
a
more
healthy
tone
of
mind
and
body
during
the
next
week
she
knew
little
or
nothing
of
how
matters
were
progressing
out
of
her
own
chamber
a
new
cook
had
been
hired
of
whom
she
was
pleased
to
hear
good
accounts
although
she
had
not
seen
her
and
ellen
under
the
mild
and
judicious
instruction
of
her
sister
had
learned
to
make
up
a
bed
neatly
to
sweep
and
dust
in
true
style
and
to
perform
all
the
little
etceteras
of
greatly
to
her
satisfaction
she
was
likewise
good
tempered
willing
and
to
all
appearances
strictly
one
morning
about
a
week
after
she
had
become
too
ill
to
keep
up
she
found
herself
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
go
down
stairs
to
breakfast
every
thing
upon
the
table
she
found
arranged
in
the
neatest
style
the
food
was
well
cooked
especially
some
tender
rice
cakes
of
which
she
was
very
fond
really
these
are
delicious
said
she
as
the
finely
flavored
cakes
almost
melted
in
her
mouth
and
this
coffee
is
just
the
thing
how
fortunate
we
have
been
to
obtain
so
good
a
cook
i
was
afraid
we
should
never
be
able
to
replace
rachel
but
even
she
is
equalled
if
not
surpassed
still
she
does
not
surpass
rachel
said
smith
a
little
gravely
rachel
was
a
treasure
indeed
she
was
and
i
have
been
sorry
enough
i
ever
let
her
go
returned
smith
at
that
moment
a
new
cook
entered
with
a
plate
of
warm
cakes
rachel
ejaculated
smith
letting
her
knife
and
fork
fall
how
do
you
do
i
am
glad
to
see
you
welcome
home
again
as
she
spoke
quickly
and
earnestly
she
held
out
her
hand
and
grasped
that
of
her
old
domestic
warmly
rachel
could
not
speak
but
as
she
left
the
room
she
put
her
apron
to
her
eyes
hers
were
not
the
only
ones
dim
with
rising
moisture
for
at
least
a
year
to
come
both
smith
and
her
excellent
cook
will
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
each
other
how
they
will
get
along
during
the
last
week
of
next
august
we
can
not
say
but
hope
the
lesson
they
have
both
received
will
teach
them
to
bear
and
forbear
chapter
xxiii
words
the
foolish
thing
said
my
aunt
rachel
speaking
warmly
to
get
hurt
at
a
mere
word
it
a
little
hard
that
people
ca
open
their
lips
but
somebody
is
offended
words
are
things
said
i
smiling
very
light
things
a
person
must
be
tender
indeed
that
is
hurt
by
a
word
the
very
lightest
thing
may
hurt
if
it
falls
on
a
tender
place
i
do
like
people
who
have
these
tender
places
said
aunt
rachel
i
never
get
hurt
at
what
is
said
to
me
no
never
to
be
ever
picking
and
mincing
and
chopping
off
your
words
to
be
afraid
to
say
this
or
that
for
fear
somebody
will
be
offended
i
abide
it
people
who
have
these
tender
places
ca
help
it
i
suppose
this
being
so
ought
we
not
to
regard
their
weakness
said
i
pain
either
of
body
or
mind
is
hard
to
bear
and
we
should
not
inflict
it
causelessly
people
who
are
so
wonderfully
sensitive
replied
aunt
rachel
growing
warmer
ought
to
shut
themselves
up
at
home
and
not
come
among
sensible
good
tempered
persons
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
can
tell
them
one
and
all
that
i
am
not
going
to
pick
out
every
hard
word
from
a
sentence
as
carefully
as
i
would
seeds
from
a
raisin
let
them
crack
them
with
their
teeth
if
they
are
afraid
to
swallow
them
whole
now
for
all
that
aunt
rachel
went
on
after
this
strain
she
was
a
kind
good
soul
in
the
main
and
i
could
see
was
sorry
for
having
hurt
the
feelings
of
mary
lane
but
she
did
like
to
acknowledge
that
she
was
in
the
wrong
that
would
detract
too
much
from
the
with
which
she
regarded
herself
knowing
her
character
very
well
i
thought
it
best
not
to
continue
the
little
argument
about
the
importance
of
words
and
so
changed
the
subject
but
every
now
and
then
aunt
rachel
would
return
to
it
each
time
softening
a
little
towards
mary
at
last
she
said
i
sure
it
was
a
little
thing
a
very
little
thing
she
might
have
known
that
nothing
unkind
was
intended
on
my
part
there
are
some
subjects
aunt
i
replied
to
which
we
can
not
bear
the
slightest
allusion
and
a
sudden
reference
to
them
is
very
apt
to
throw
us
off
of
our
guard
what
you
said
to
mary
has
in
all
probability
touched
some
weakness
of
character
or
probed
some
wound
that
time
has
been
able
to
heal
i
have
always
thought
her
a
sensible
good
natured
girl
and
so
have
i
but
i
really
can
not
think
that
she
has
shown
her
good
sense
or
good
nature
in
the
present
case
it
is
a
very
bad
failing
this
of
being
over
sensitive
and
exceedingly
annoying
to
one
friends
it
is
i
know
but
still
all
of
us
have
a
weak
point
and
when
that
is
assailed
we
are
very
apt
to
betray
our
feelings
well
i
say
now
as
i
have
always
said
i
do
like
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
people
who
have
these
weak
points
this
being
hurt
by
a
word
as
if
words
were
blows
is
something
that
does
not
come
within
the
range
of
my
sympathies
and
yet
aunt
said
i
all
have
weak
points
even
you
are
not
entirely
free
from
them
me
aunt
rachel
bridled
yes
and
if
even
as
light
a
thing
as
a
word
were
to
fall
upon
them
you
would
suffer
pain
pray
said
aunt
rachel
with
much
dignity
of
manner
she
was
chafed
by
my
words
light
as
they
were
inform
me
where
these
weaknesses
of
which
you
are
pleased
to
speak
lie
oh
no
you
must
excuse
me
that
would
be
very
much
out
of
place
but
i
only
stated
a
general
fact
that
appertains
to
all
of
us
aunt
rachel
looked
very
grave
i
had
laid
the
weight
of
words
upon
a
weakness
of
her
character
and
it
had
given
her
pain
that
weakness
was
a
peculiarly
good
opinion
of
herself
i
had
made
no
allegation
against
her
and
there
was
none
in
my
mind
my
words
simply
expressed
the
general
truth
that
we
all
have
weaknesses
and
included
her
in
their
application
but
she
imagined
that
i
referred
to
some
particular
defect
or
fault
and
as
she
was
against
words
they
had
wounded
her
for
a
day
or
two
aunt
rachel
remained
more
sober
than
was
her
wont
i
knew
the
cause
but
did
not
attempt
to
remove
from
her
mind
an
impression
my
words
had
made
one
day
about
a
week
after
i
said
to
her
aunt
rachel
i
saw
mary
lane
mother
this
morning
ah
the
old
lady
looked
up
at
me
enquiringly
i
do
wonder
your
words
hurt
the
poor
girl
i
added
why
what
did
i
say
quickly
asked
aunt
rachel
you
said
that
she
was
a
jilt
but
i
was
only
in
jest
and
she
knew
it
i
did
not
really
mean
any
thing
i
surprised
that
mary
should
be
so
foolish
you
will
not
be
surprised
when
you
know
all
was
my
answer
all
what
all
i
sure
i
was
in
earnest
i
did
mean
to
hurt
the
poor
girl
feelings
my
aunt
looked
very
much
troubled
no
one
blames
you
aunt
rachel
said
i
mary
knows
you
intend
wounding
her
but
why
should
she
take
a
little
word
so
much
to
heart
it
must
have
had
more
truth
in
it
than
i
supposed
did
you
know
that
mary
refused
an
offer
of
marriage
from
walter
green
last
week
why
no
it
ca
be
possible
refused
walter
green
yes
they
been
intimate
for
a
long
time
i
know
she
certainly
encouraged
him
i
think
it
more
than
probable
is
it
possible
then
that
she
did
really
jilt
the
young
man
exclaimed
aunt
rachel
this
has
been
said
of
her
i
replied
but
as
far
as
i
can
learn
she
was
really
attached
to
him
and
suffered
great
pain
in
rejecting
his
offer
wisely
she
regarded
marriage
as
the
most
important
event
of
her
life
and
refused
to
make
so
solemn
a
contract
with
one
in
whose
principles
she
had
not
the
fullest
confidence
but
she
ought
not
to
have
encouraged
walter
if
she
did
not
intend
marrying
him
said
aunt
rachel
with
some
warmth
she
encouraged
him
so
long
as
she
thought
well
of
him
a
closer
view
revealed
points
of
character
hidden
by
distance
when
she
saw
these
her
feelings
were
already
deeply
involved
but
like
a
true
woman
she
turned
from
the
proffered
hand
even
though
while
in
doing
so
her
heart
palpitated
with
pain
there
is
nothing
false
about
mary
lane
she
could
no
more
trifle
with
a
lover
than
she
could
commit
a
crime
think
then
how
almost
impossible
it
would
be
for
her
to
hear
herself
called
under
existing
circumstances
even
in
sport
a
jilt
without
being
hurt
words
sometimes
have
power
to
hurt
more
than
blows
do
you
not
see
this
now
aunt
rachel
oh
yes
yes
i
see
it
and
i
saw
it
before
said
the
old
lady
and
in
future
i
will
be
more
careful
of
my
words
it
is
pretty
late
in
life
to
learn
this
lesson
but
we
are
never
too
late
to
learn
poor
mary
it
grieves
me
to
think
that
i
should
have
hurt
her
so
much
yes
words
often
have
in
them
a
smarting
force
and
we
can
not
be
too
guarded
how
we
use
them
think
twice
before
you
speak
once
is
a
trite
but
wise
saying
we
teach
it
to
our
children
very
carefully
but
are
too
apt
to
forget
that
it
has
not
lost
its
application
to
ourselves
chapter
xxiv
may
be
so
next
time
you
go
out
you
buy
me
a
wagon
wo
you
mother
said
my
little
boy
to
me
one
day
i
did
want
to
say
no
and
destroy
his
happy
feelings
and
i
was
not
prepared
to
say
yes
and
so
i
gave
the
evasive
reply
so
often
used
under
such
circumstances
may
be
so
and
which
was
meant
rather
as
a
negative
than
an
affirmative
the
child
was
satisfied
for
he
gave
my
words
the
meaning
he
wished
them
to
have
in
a
little
while
after
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
not
so
my
boy
to
him
the
may
be
so
was
yes
and
he
set
his
heart
confidently
on
receiving
the
wagon
the
next
time
i
should
go
out
this
happened
on
the
afternoon
of
that
very
day
it
was
towards
evening
when
i
returned
the
moment
i
rung
the
bell
at
my
own
door
i
heard
his
pattering
feet
and
gleeful
voice
in
the
entry
where
my
wagon
said
he
as
i
entered
a
shade
of
disappointment
falling
suddenly
upon
his
excited
happy
face
what
wagon
dear
i
asked
my
wagon
the
wagon
you
promised
to
buy
me
i
did
promise
to
buy
a
wagon
my
son
oh
yes
you
did
mother
you
promised
me
this
morning
tears
were
already
in
his
eye
and
his
face
wore
a
look
of
distressing
disappointment
i
promised
to
buy
you
a
wagon
i
am
sure
i
remember
nothing
about
it
i
replied
confidently
what
in
the
world
put
that
into
your
head
did
i
ask
you
said
the
child
the
tears
now
overflowing
his
cheeks
yes
i
believe
you
did
ask
me
something
about
a
wagon
but
i
promise
to
buy
you
one
oh
yes
you
did
mother
you
said
may
be
so
but
be
so
does
mean
yes
at
this
the
little
fellow
uttered
a
distressing
cry
his
heart
was
almost
broken
by
disappointment
he
had
interpreted
my
words
according
to
his
own
wishes
and
not
according
to
their
real
meaning
unprepared
for
an
occurrence
of
this
kind
i
was
not
in
the
mood
to
sympathise
with
my
child
fully
to
be
met
thus
at
the
moment
of
my
return
home
disturbed
me
i
did
promise
to
buy
you
a
wagon
and
you
must
stop
crying
about
it
said
i
seeing
that
he
had
given
way
to
his
feelings
and
was
crying
in
a
loud
voice
but
he
cried
on
i
went
up
stairs
to
lay
off
my
things
and
he
followed
still
crying
you
must
hush
now
said
i
more
positively
i
can
not
permit
this
i
never
promised
to
buy
you
a
wagon
you
said
may
be
so
sobbed
the
child
may
be
so
and
yes
are
two
different
things
if
i
had
said
that
i
would
buy
you
a
wagon
then
there
would
have
been
some
reason
in
your
disappointment
but
i
said
no
such
thing
he
had
paused
to
listen
but
as
i
ceased
speaking
his
crying
was
renewed
you
must
stop
this
now
there
is
no
use
in
it
and
i
will
not
have
it
said
i
resolutely
my
boy
choked
down
for
a
few
moments
at
this
and
half
stifled
his
grief
but
him
it
flowed
on
again
as
wildly
as
ever
i
felt
impatient
stop
this
moment
i
say
and
i
took
hold
of
his
arm
firmly
my
will
is
strong
and
when
a
little
excited
it
often
leads
me
beyond
where
i
would
go
in
moments
of
reflection
my
boy
knew
this
by
experience
by
my
manner
of
speaking
he
saw
that
i
was
in
earnest
and
that
if
he
did
not
obey
me
punishment
would
follow
so
with
what
must
have
been
a
powerful
effort
for
one
so
young
he
stifled
the
utterance
of
his
grief
but
the
storm
within
raged
none
the
less
violently
and
i
could
see
his
little
frame
quiver
as
he
strove
to
repress
the
rising
sobs
turning
away
from
me
he
went
and
sat
down
on
a
low
seat
in
a
corner
of
the
room
i
saw
his
form
in
the
glass
as
i
stood
before
it
to
arrange
my
hair
after
laying
aside
my
bonnet
and
for
the
first
time
my
feelings
were
touched
there
was
an
abandonment
in
his
whole
attitude
an
air
of
grief
about
him
that
affected
me
with
pity
and
tenderness
poor
child
i
sighed
his
heart
is
almost
broken
i
ought
to
have
said
yes
or
no
and
then
all
would
have
been
settled
come
said
i
after
a
few
moments
reaching
my
hand
towards
the
child
let
us
go
down
and
look
out
for
father
he
will
be
home
soon
i
spoke
kindly
and
cheerfully
but
he
neither
moved
looked
up
nor
gave
the
smallest
sign
that
he
heard
me
oh
well
said
i
with
some
impatience
in
my
voice
it
matter
at
all
if
you
rather
sit
there
than
come
down
into
the
parlor
and
look
out
for
dear
father
you
can
please
yourself
and
turning
away
as
i
spoke
i
left
the
chamber
and
went
down
stairs
seating
myself
at
the
window
i
looked
forth
and
endeavored
to
feel
unconcerned
and
cheerful
but
this
was
beyond
my
power
i
saw
nothing
but
the
form
of
my
grieving
child
and
could
think
of
nothing
but
his
sorrow
and
disappointment
nancy
said
i
to
one
of
my
domestics
who
happened
to
come
into
the
parlor
to
ask
me
some
question
i
wish
you
would
run
down
to
the
toy
store
in
the
next
block
and
buy
neddy
a
wagon
his
heart
is
almost
broken
about
one
the
girl
always
willing
when
kindly
spoke
to
ran
off
to
obey
my
wishes
and
in
a
little
while
came
back
with
the
article
wanted
now
said
i
go
up
into
my
room
and
tell
neddy
that
i
got
something
for
him
do
mention
the
wagon
i
want
to
take
him
by
surprise
nancy
went
bounding
up
the
stairs
and
i
placed
the
wagon
in
the
centre
of
the
room
where
it
would
meet
the
child
eyes
on
the
moment
of
his
entrance
and
then
sat
down
to
await
his
coming
and
enjoy
his
surprise
and
delight
after
the
lapse
of
about
a
minute
i
heard
nancy
coming
down
slowly
neddy
asleep
said
she
looking
in
at
the
door
asleep
i
felt
greatly
disappointed
yes
he
was
on
the
floor
asleep
i
took
him
up
and
laid
him
in
your
bed
then
he
over
his
troubles
said
i
attempting
to
find
a
relief
for
my
feelings
in
this
utterance
but
no
such
relief
came
taking
the
wagon
in
my
hand
i
went
up
to
the
chamber
where
he
lay
and
bent
over
him
the
signs
of
grief
were
still
upon
his
innocent
face
and
every
now
and
then
a
faint
sigh
or
sob
gave
evidence
that
even
sleep
had
not
yet
hushed
entirely
the
storm
which
had
swept
over
him
neddy
i
spoke
to
him
in
a
voice
of
tenderness
hoping
that
my
words
might
reach
his
ear
neddy
dear
i
bought
you
a
wagon
but
his
senses
were
locked
taking
him
up
i
undressed
him
and
then
after
kissing
his
lips
brow
and
cheeks
laid
him
in
his
little
bed
and
placed
the
wagon
on
the
pillow
beside
him
even
until
the
late
hour
at
which
i
retired
on
that
evening
were
my
feelings
oppressed
by
the
incident
i
have
described
my
may
be
so
uttered
in
order
to
avoid
giving
the
direct
answer
my
child
wanted
had
occasioned
him
far
more
pain
than
a
positive
refusal
of
his
request
could
have
done
i
will
be
more
careful
in
future
said
i
as
i
lay
thinking
about
the
occurrence
how
i
create
false
hopes
my
yea
shall
be
yea
and
my
nay
nay
of
these
cometh
not
evil
in
the
morning
when
i
awoke
i
found
neddy
in
possession
of
his
wagon
he
was
running
with
it
around
the
room
as
happy
as
if
a
tear
had
never
been
upon
his
cheek
i
looked
at
him
for
many
minutes
without
speaking
at
last
seeing
that
i
was
awake
he
bounded
up
to
the
bedside
and
kissing
me
said
thank
you
dear
mother
for
buying
me
this
wagon
you
are
a
good
mother
i
must
own
to
having
felt
some
doubts
on
the
subject
of
compliment
at
the
time
since
this
little
experience
i
have
been
more
careful
how
i
answer
the
petitions
of
my
children
and
avoid
the
may
be
so
i
see
about
it
and
other
such
evasive
answers
that
come
so
readily
to
the
lips
the
good
result
i
have
experienced
in
many
instances
chapter
xxv
the
poor
child
died
my
baby
nine
months
old
had
some
fever
and
seemed
very
unwell
one
neighbor
said
you
better
send
for
the
doctor
another
suggested
that
it
had
no
doubt
eaten
something
that
disagreed
with
it
and
that
a
little
antimonial
wine
would
enable
it
to
throw
it
off
another
advised
a
few
grains
of
calomel
and
another
a
dose
of
rheubarb
but
i
said
no
i
wait
a
little
while
and
see
if
it
wo
get
better
you
should
give
him
medicine
in
time
many
a
person
dies
from
not
taking
medicine
in
time
said
a
lady
who
expressed
more
than
usual
concern
for
the
of
my
baby
she
had
a
very
sick
child
herself
many
more
die
i
replied
from
taking
medicine
too
soon
i
believe
that
one
half
of
the
diseases
in
the
world
are
produced
by
medicines
and
that
the
other
half
are
often
made
worse
by
their
injudicious
administration
you
better
send
for
the
doctor
urged
the
lady
no
i
wait
until
the
morning
and
then
if
he
no
better
or
should
be
worse
i
call
in
our
physician
children
often
appear
very
sick
one
hour
and
are
comparatively
well
again
in
the
next
it
a
great
risk
said
the
lady
gravely
a
very
great
risk
i
called
in
the
doctor
the
moment
my
dear
little
eddy
began
to
droop
about
and
it
well
i
did
he
near
death
door
as
it
is
and
without
medical
aid
i
would
certainly
have
lost
him
before
this
he
only
been
sick
a
week
and
you
know
yourself
how
low
he
is
reduced
where
do
you
think
he
would
have
been
without
medicine
the
disease
has
taken
a
terrible
hold
of
him
why
the
doctor
has
bled
him
twice
and
his
little
chest
is
raw
all
over
from
a
blister
he
has
been
cupped
and
leeched
we
have
had
mustard
plasters
upon
his
arms
and
the
calves
of
his
legs
i
do
know
how
many
grains
of
calomel
he
has
taken
and
it
has
salivated
him
dreadfully
oh
such
a
sore
mouth
poor
child
he
suffers
dreadfully
besides
he
has
taken
some
kind
of
powder
almost
every
hour
they
are
dreadfully
nauseous
and
we
have
to
hold
him
every
time
and
pour
them
down
his
throat
oh
dear
it
makes
my
heart
sick
now
with
all
this
the
disease
hangs
on
almost
as
bad
as
ever
suppose
we
had
sent
for
the
doctor
at
first
ca
you
see
what
would
have
been
the
consequence
it
is
very
wrong
to
put
off
calling
in
a
physician
upon
the
first
symptoms
of
a
disease
pardon
me
lee
for
saying
so
was
my
reply
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
you
had
not
called
the
doctor
your
child
would
have
been
quite
well
lee
that
was
the
lady
name
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
disapproval
of
my
remark
but
can
not
you
see
yourself
that
it
is
not
the
disease
that
has
reduced
your
child
so
low
the
bleeding
blistering
cupping
leeching
and
calomel
administrations
would
have
done
all
this
had
your
child
been
perfectly
well
when
it
went
into
the
hands
but
the
disease
would
have
killed
him
inevitably
if
it
requires
all
this
to
break
it
do
you
see
that
it
must
have
taken
a
most
fatal
hold
on
the
poor
child
system
no
lee
i
can
not
see
any
such
thing
was
my
reply
the
medicine
probably
fixed
the
disease
that
would
if
left
alone
have
retired
of
itself
what
does
the
doctor
say
ails
the
child
he
does
not
seem
to
know
there
seems
to
be
a
complication
of
diseases
produced
by
the
treatment
no
doubt
if
there
had
been
scarlet
fever
or
small
pox
or
croup
active
and
energetic
treatment
would
probably
have
been
required
and
the
doctor
would
have
known
what
he
was
about
in
administering
his
remedies
but
in
a
slight
indisposition
like
that
from
which
your
child
suffered
it
is
in
my
opinion
always
better
to
give
no
medicine
for
a
time
drugs
thrown
into
the
tender
system
of
a
child
will
always
produce
disease
of
some
kind
more
or
less
severe
and
where
slight
disorders
already
exist
they
are
apt
to
give
them
a
dangerous
hold
upon
the
body
or
uniting
with
them
cause
a
most
serious
and
at
times
fatal
illness
but
lee
shook
her
head
she
thought
the
doctors
knew
best
they
had
great
confidence
in
their
family
physician
he
had
doctored
them
through
many
dangerous
attacks
and
had
always
brought
them
through
safely
as
to
the
notions
about
giving
little
or
no
medicine
she
had
no
confidence
in
them
medicine
was
necessary
at
times
and
she
always
gave
her
children
medicine
at
least
two
or
three
times
a
year
whether
they
were
sick
or
well
prevention
in
her
eyes
was
better
than
cure
and
where
there
was
actual
sickness
she
was
in
favor
of
vigorous
treatment
one
good
dose
of
medicine
would
do
more
good
than
a
hundred
little
ones
with
much
more
to
the
same
effect
on
the
next
morning
my
dear
baby
who
was
just
as
sick
for
a
few
hours
as
lee
child
was
at
first
was
as
well
as
ever
not
long
after
breakfast
i
was
sent
for
by
lee
her
poor
child
was
much
worse
the
servant
said
that
she
was
sure
it
was
dying
i
changed
my
dress
hurriedly
and
went
over
to
the
house
of
my
neighbor
shall
i
describe
the
painful
object
that
met
my
sight
it
was
three
days
since
i
had
seen
the
little
sufferer
but
oh
how
it
had
changed
in
that
brief
time
its
face
was
sunken
its
eyes
far
back
in
their
sockets
and
its
forehead
marked
with
lines
of
suffering
the
whole
of
its
breast
was
raw
from
the
blister
and
its
mouth
lying
open
showed
with
painful
distinctness
the
dreadful
injury
wrought
by
the
mercury
thrown
with
such
a
liberal
hand
into
its
delicate
system
all
the
life
seemed
to
have
withdrawn
itself
from
the
skin
for
the
vital
forces
in
the
centre
of
its
body
were
acting
but
feebly
the
doctor
came
in
while
i
was
there
he
said
but
little
it
was
plain
that
he
was
entirely
at
fault
and
that
he
saw
no
hope
of
a
favorable
issue
all
his
active
treatment
had
tended
to
break
down
the
child
rather
than
cure
the
disease
from
which
it
at
first
suffered
there
was
a
great
deal
of
heat
about
the
child
head
and
he
said
something
about
having
it
shaved
for
a
blister
would
ice
do
better
doctor
i
felt
constrained
to
suggest
he
turned
upon
me
quickly
and
seemed
annoyed
no
madam
he
replied
with
dignity
i
said
no
more
for
i
felt
how
vain
my
words
would
be
the
blister
however
was
not
ordered
but
in
its
stead
mustard
plasters
were
directed
to
be
placed
over
the
feet
and
legs
to
the
knees
and
a
solution
of
iodine
or
iron
i
do
now
remember
which
prescribed
to
be
given
every
half
hour
i
went
home
some
time
after
the
doctor
left
feeling
sick
at
heart
they
are
murdering
that
child
i
could
not
help
saying
to
myself
my
own
dear
babe
i
found
full
of
health
and
life
and
i
hugged
it
to
my
breast
with
a
feeling
of
thankfulness
before
the
day
closed
lee
poor
child
died
was
it
a
cause
of
wonder
chapter
xxvi
the
rival
bonnets
i
have
a
pleasant
story
to
relate
of
a
couple
of
fashionables
of
our
city
which
will
serve
to
diversify
these
confessions
and
amuse
the
reader
to
the
incidents
true
in
the
main
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
adding
some
slight
variations
of
my
own
a
lady
of
some
note
in
society
named
claudine
received
a
very
beautiful
bonnet
from
new
york
a
little
in
advance
of
others
and
being
one
of
the
rival
leaders
in
the
fashionable
world
felt
some
at
the
thought
of
appearing
abroad
in
the
elegant
and
thereby
getting
the
reputation
of
leading
the
fashion
notwithstanding
claudine
efforts
to
keep
the
matter
a
secret
and
thus
be
able
to
create
a
surprise
when
she
appeared
at
church
on
the
next
sunday
the
fact
that
she
had
received
the
bonnet
leaked
out
and
there
was
some
excitement
about
it
among
those
who
heard
of
the
new
bonnet
was
a
ballman
who
had
written
to
a
friend
to
get
for
her
the
very
article
obtained
first
by
claudine
from
some
cause
or
other
a
delay
had
occurred
and
to
her
chagrin
she
learned
that
a
rival
had
the
new
fashion
and
would
get
the
that
she
so
much
coveted
the
disappointment
to
one
whose
pleasures
in
life
are
so
circumscribed
as
those
of
a
real
fashionable
lady
was
severe
indeed
she
did
not
sleep
more
than
a
few
hours
on
the
night
after
she
received
the
mortifying
intelligence
the
year
before
claudine
had
led
the
fashion
in
some
article
of
dress
and
to
see
her
carry
off
the
palm
in
bonnets
on
this
occasion
when
she
had
striven
so
hard
to
be
in
advance
was
more
than
bellman
could
endure
the
result
of
a
night
thinking
on
the
subject
was
a
determination
to
pursue
a
very
extraordinary
course
the
nature
of
which
will
be
seen
by
telegraph
bellman
communicated
with
her
friend
in
new
york
desiring
her
to
send
on
by
the
evening
of
the
next
day
which
was
saturday
the
bonnet
she
had
ordered
if
four
prices
had
to
be
paid
as
an
inducement
to
get
the
milliner
to
use
extra
exertions
in
getting
it
up
in
due
time
notice
came
back
that
the
bonnet
would
be
sent
on
by
express
on
saturday
much
to
the
joy
of
ballman
who
from
the
interest
she
felt
in
carrying
out
her
intentions
had
entirely
recovered
from
the
painful
disappointment
at
first
experienced
saturday
brought
the
bonnet
and
a
beautiful
one
it
was
a
few
natural
sighs
were
expended
over
the
elegant
affair
and
then
other
feelings
came
in
to
chase
away
regrets
at
not
having
been
first
to
secure
the
article
on
the
day
previous
friday
ballman
called
upon
a
fashionable
milliner
and
held
with
her
the
following
conversation
you
have
heard
of
claudine
new
bonnet
i
presume
yes
madam
replied
the
milliner
do
you
think
it
will
take
asked
ballman
i
do
you
have
not
the
pattern
oh
yes
i
received
one
a
week
ago
you
did
yes
but
some
one
must
introduce
it
as
claudine
is
about
doing
this
there
is
little
doubt
of
its
becoming
the
fashion
for
the
style
is
striking
as
well
as
tasteful
ballman
mused
for
some
moments
there
she
drew
the
milliner
aside
and
said
in
a
low
confidential
tone
do
you
think
you
could
get
up
a
bonnet
a
handsome
as
that
and
in
just
as
good
taste
i
know
i
could
in
my
last
received
london
and
paris
fashions
are
several
bonnets
a
handsome
as
the
one
that
is
about
being
adopted
in
new
york
and
here
also
without
doubt
i
am
not
so
sure
of
its
being
adopted
here
said
the
lady
if
claudine
introduces
it
as
i
understand
she
intends
doing
on
sunday
it
will
certainly
be
approved
and
the
style
followed
i
very
much
doubt
it
but
we
will
see
where
are
the
bonnets
you
spoke
of
just
now
the
milliner
brought
forth
a
number
of
pattern
cards
and
plates
and
pointed
out
two
bonnets
either
of
which
in
her
judgment
was
more
beautiful
than
the
one
claudine
had
received
far
handsomer
was
the
brief
remark
with
which
ballman
approved
the
milliner
judgment
and
now
she
added
can
you
get
me
up
one
of
these
by
sunday
i
will
try
try
wo
do
said
the
lady
with
some
excitement
in
her
manner
i
must
have
the
bonnet
can
you
make
it
yes
very
well
then
make
it
and
let
it
be
done
in
your
very
best
manner
why
i
wish
to
have
this
bonnet
i
need
hardly
explain
to
you
i
believed
that
i
would
have
received
the
bonnet
about
to
be
adopted
in
new
york
first
i
had
written
to
a
friend
to
procure
it
but
by
some
means
claudine
has
obtained
hers
in
advance
of
me
mine
will
be
here
but
i
do
mean
to
wear
it
i
wish
to
lead
if
you
were
both
to
appear
in
this
bonnet
the
fashion
would
be
decided
said
the
milliner
i
know
but
i
have
no
wish
to
share
the
honor
with
claudine
make
me
the
bonnet
i
have
selected
and
i
will
see
that
it
puts
hers
down
you
will
remember
said
the
milliner
that
hers
has
been
already
adopted
in
new
york
this
will
be
almost
sure
to
give
it
the
preference
it
would
be
better
that
you
did
not
attempt
a
rivalry
than
that
you
should
be
beaten
but
i
do
mean
to
be
beaten
replied
the
lady
i
have
taken
measures
to
prevent
that
after
sunday
you
will
hear
no
more
of
the
new
york
bonnet
mine
will
go
and
this
i
need
not
tell
you
will
be
a
feather
in
your
cap
and
dollars
in
your
pocket
as
i
will
refer
to
you
as
the
only
one
who
can
get
it
up
so
do
your
best
and
improve
the
pattern
we
have
selected
if
it
will
bear
improvement
the
milliner
promised
to
do
her
prettiest
and
ballman
returned
home
in
a
state
of
considerable
elation
at
the
prospect
of
carrying
off
the
palm
and
humiliating
her
rival
at
the
same
time
claudine
though
a
little
vain
and
fond
of
excelling
was
a
woman
of
kind
feelings
and
entirely
superior
to
the
petty
jealousies
that
annoyed
ballman
and
soured
her
towards
all
who
succeeded
in
rivalling
her
in
matters
of
taste
and
fashion
of
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
lady
who
had
been
so
troubled
at
her
reception
of
a
new
style
of
bonnet
from
new
york
she
was
entirely
ignorant
she
was
not
even
aware
that
ballman
had
ordered
the
same
article
nor
that
she
had
suffered
a
disappointment
saturday
came
claudine
was
busy
over
some
little
article
of
dress
that
was
to
add
to
her
appearance
on
the
next
day
when
an
irish
girl
who
had
formerly
lived
with
her
entered
her
room
ah
kitty
said
the
lady
pleasantly
how
do
you
do
i
right
well
mum
thankee
replied
kitty
with
a
courtesy
where
do
you
live
now
kitty
inquired
claudine
i
living
with
ballman
said
the
girl
a
very
good
place
i
have
no
doubt
oh
yes
mum
it
is
a
good
place
i
hai
much
to
do
going
out
with
the
children
on
good
days
and
seein
after
them
in
the
house
and
i
get
good
wages
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
kitty
and
hope
you
will
not
give
up
so
good
a
home
no
indeed
mum
and
i
wo
do
that
but
claudine
kitty
face
flushed
and
she
stammered
in
her
speech
what
do
you
wish
to
say
inquired
the
lady
seeing
that
kitty
hesitated
to
speak
of
what
was
on
her
mind
indade
mum
said
kitty
evincing
much
perplexity
i
hardly
know
what
i
ought
to
do
but
yez
were
good
to
me
mum
when
i
was
sick
and
did
send
me
off
to
the
poor
house
like
some
girls
are
sent
and
i
never
can
forget
yez
while
there
breath
in
me
body
and
now
i
come
to
ask
yez
just
as
a
favor
to
me
not
to
wear
that
new
bonnet
from
new
york
it
was
some
moments
before
the
surprise
occasioned
by
so
novel
and
unexpected
a
request
left
claudine
free
to
make
any
reply
why
kitty
she
at
length
exclaimed
what
on
earth
can
you
mean
indade
mum
and
yez
must
ask
me
what
i
mane
only
do
wear
the
bonnet
to
church
on
the
morrow
because
because
och
indade
mum
dear
i
ca
say
any
more
it
would
be
right
claudine
told
kitty
to
sit
down
an
invitation
which
the
girl
who
was
much
agitated
accepted
the
lady
then
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
for
some
time
kitty
she
remarked
at
length
in
a
serious
manner
what
you
have
said
to
me
sounds
very
strangely
how
you
should
know
that
i
intended
appearing
in
a
new
bonnet
or
why
you
should
be
so
much
interested
in
the
matter
is
more
than
i
can
understand
as
to
acting
as
you
desire
i
see
no
reason
for
that
whatever
this
reply
only
had
the
effect
of
causing
kitty
to
urge
her
request
more
strenuously
but
she
would
give
no
reason
for
her
singular
conduct
after
the
girl
had
gone
away
claudine
laid
aside
her
work
for
she
was
not
in
a
state
of
mind
to
do
any
thing
but
think
sat
for
at
least
an
hour
musing
upon
the
strange
incident
which
had
occurred
all
at
once
it
flashed
upon
her
mind
that
there
must
be
some
plot
in
progress
to
discredit
or
rival
her
new
bonnet
which
kitty
had
learned
at
ballman
the
more
she
thought
of
this
the
more
fully
did
she
become
satisfied
that
it
must
be
so
she
was
aware
that
ballman
had
been
chagrined
at
her
leading
off
in
new
fashions
once
or
twice
before
and
the
fact
evident
now
that
she
knew
of
her
reception
of
the
bonnet
and
kitty
anxiety
that
she
should
not
wear
it
on
sunday
led
her
to
the
conviction
that
there
was
some
plot
against
her
at
first
she
determined
to
appear
in
her
new
bonnet
disregardful
of
warning
but
subsequent
reflection
brought
her
to
a
different
conclusion
the
moment
claudine
settled
it
in
her
mind
that
she
would
not
appear
in
the
new
bonnet
she
began
dressing
herself
hurriedly
to
go
out
it
was
as
late
as
five
in
the
afternoon
when
she
called
at
the
store
of
the
milliner
who
had
been
commissioned
by
ballman
to
get
the
rival
bonnet
have
you
the
last
fashions
from
abroad
enquired
claudine
we
have
replied
the
milliner
will
you
let
me
see
them
certainly
and
the
patterns
were
shown
after
examining
them
carefully
for
some
time
claudine
selected
a
style
of
bonnet
that
pleased
her
fancy
and
said
you
must
get
me
up
this
bonnet
so
that
i
can
wear
it
impossible
madam
replied
the
milliner
this
is
saturday
evening
i
know
it
is
but
for
money
you
can
get
one
of
your
girls
to
work
all
night
i
do
care
what
you
charge
but
i
must
have
the
bonnet
the
milliner
still
hesitated
and
seemed
to
be
confused
and
uneasy
she
asked
claudine
to
sit
down
and
wait
for
a
little
while
and
then
retired
to
think
upon
what
she
had
better
do
the
fact
was
claudine
had
pitched
upon
the
very
bonnet
ballman
had
ordered
and
her
earnestness
about
having
it
made
in
time
to
wear
on
the
next
day
put
it
almost
beyond
her
power
to
say
no
if
she
were
to
tell
her
that
ballman
had
ordered
the
same
bonnet
it
would
she
knew
settle
the
matter
but
it
occurred
to
her
that
if
both
the
ladies
were
to
appear
at
church
in
the
same
style
of
bonnet
the
fashion
would
be
sure
to
take
and
she
in
consequence
get
a
large
run
of
business
this
thought
sent
the
blood
bounding
through
the
milliner
veins
and
decided
her
to
keep
her
own
counsel
and
take
claudine
order
she
as
much
right
to
the
bonnet
as
ballman
settled
all
ethical
questions
that
intruded
themselves
upon
the
milliner
i
will
have
it
ready
for
you
she
said
on
returning
to
claudine
very
well
but
mind
said
the
lady
i
wish
it
got
up
in
the
very
best
style
the
hurry
must
not
take
from
its
beauty
as
for
the
price
charge
what
you
please
the
milliner
promised
every
thing
and
claudine
went
home
to
think
about
the
important
events
of
the
approaching
sabbath
on
sunday
morning
both
bonnets
were
sent
home
and
both
the
ladies
fully
approved
the
style
effect
and
all
things
appertaining
to
the
elegant
affairs
at
ten
kitty
who
was
a
irish
girl
came
into
the
chamber
of
ballman
dressed
up
in
her
best
which
was
not
saying
much
for
the
taste
and
elegance
of
her
appearance
are
you
all
ready
asked
her
mistress
yes
mum
very
well
kitty
here
the
bonnet
now
remember
you
are
to
go
into
the
pew
just
in
front
of
ours
the
armburner
are
all
out
of
town
and
there
will
be
no
one
to
occupy
it
kitty
received
the
elegant
bonnet
which
had
come
on
express
from
new
york
and
placed
it
upon
her
head
you
really
look
charming
said
the
lady
but
kitty
was
not
flattered
by
her
words
and
evinced
so
little
heart
in
what
she
was
doing
that
mrs
ballman
said
to
her
in
a
half
threatening
tone
as
she
left
the
room
mind
kitty
i
shall
expect
to
see
you
at
church
oh
yes
mum
i
be
there
replied
kitty
courtesying
awkwardly
and
retiring
not
long
after
kitty
had
retired
ballman
after
surveying
for
many
minutes
the
effect
of
her
new
bonnet
becoming
more
and
more
pleased
with
it
every
moment
and
more
and
more
satisfied
that
it
would
take
left
her
room
and
was
descending
the
stairs
for
the
purpose
of
joining
the
family
who
were
awaiting
her
below
just
at
that
unlucky
moment
a
servant
who
was
bringing
down
a
vessel
of
water
slipped
and
a
portion
of
the
contents
came
dashing
over
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
richly
attired
lady
ruining
her
elegant
bonnet
and
completely
destroying
the
happy
frame
of
mind
in
which
she
was
about
attending
public
worship
no
wonder
that
she
cried
aloud
from
the
sudden
shock
and
distress
so
untoward
an
event
occasioned
nor
that
she
went
back
weeping
to
her
chamber
and
refused
to
be
comforted
ballman
and
the
children
proceeded
alone
to
church
on
that
day
on
their
return
home
they
found
the
lady
in
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
but
ballman
looked
grave
and
was
unusually
silent
kitty
came
home
and
gave
up
her
elegant
and
when
her
mistress
told
her
that
she
might
keep
it
she
thanked
her
but
declined
the
present
you
went
to
church
of
course
she
said
oh
yes
mum
replied
kitty
and
sat
in
the
armburner
pew
yes
mum
alone
yes
mum
was
claudine
there
yes
mum
did
she
wear
her
new
bonnet
yes
mum
it
was
exactly
like
this
oh
no
mum
it
was
exactly
like
the
new
one
you
had
sent
home
this
morning
what
the
face
of
the
lady
flushed
instantly
was
it
like
this
no
mum
ballman
sunk
into
a
chair
you
can
retire
kitty
she
said
and
the
girl
withdrew
leaving
her
to
her
own
feelings
and
reflections
which
were
not
of
the
most
pleasing
character
the
appearance
of
kitty
at
church
fully
explained
to
claudine
the
ungenerous
game
that
had
been
played
against
her
her
first
thought
was
to
retaliate
but
reflection
brought
other
and
better
feelings
into
play
instead
of
exposing
what
had
been
done
she
destroyed
the
bonnet
received
from
new
york
and
made
an
effort
to
keep
what
had
occurred
a
secret
but
kitty
appearance
at
church
in
such
an
elegant
affair
naturally
created
some
talk
one
surmise
after
another
was
started
and
at
last
from
hints
dropped
by
the
milliner
and
admissions
almost
extorted
from
claudine
the
truth
came
out
so
fully
that
all
understood
it
nor
was
ballman
long
left
in
ignorance
on
this
head
as
to
the
fashion
claudine
bonnet
became
the
rage
though
as
might
be
supposed
ballman
refused
to
adopt
it
who
will
be
the
successful
rival
next
season
i
am
unable
to
predict
but
it
is
believed
that
claudine
intends
giving
ballman
an
advance
of
two
weeks
and
then
coming
in
with
a
different
style
and
beating
her
in
spite
of
the
advantage
chapter
xxvii
my
washerwoman
we
were
sitting
at
tea
one
evening
smith
my
sister
and
her
husband
john
jones
and
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
pleasant
conversation
bridget
looked
into
the
what
is
wanted
said
i
mary
green
is
down
stairs
oh
the
washerwoman
yes
well
what
does
she
want
i
knew
what
she
wanted
well
enough
she
had
come
for
two
dollars
that
i
owed
her
i
felt
annoyed
why
the
reader
asks
obligations
of
this
kind
should
always
be
met
promptly
and
cheerfully
true
and
i
am
of
those
who
never
grudge
the
humble
poor
the
reward
of
their
labor
but
it
so
happened
that
i
had
received
a
pretty
liberal
supply
of
money
from
my
husband
on
this
very
day
all
of
which
i
had
spent
in
shopping
some
of
my
purchases
could
not
be
classed
exactly
under
the
head
articles
of
domestic
economy
and
i
was
already
in
rather
a
repentant
mood
the
warmth
of
admiration
at
the
sight
of
sundry
ornamental
trifles
having
subsided
almost
as
soon
as
i
found
myself
their
owner
to
my
question
bridget
very
promptly
answered
she
come
for
her
money
when
a
woman
feels
annoyed
she
is
rarely
able
to
repress
its
exhibition
men
are
cooler
and
have
a
quicker
self
control
they
make
better
hypocrites
she
very
prompt
i
remarked
a
little
fretfully
as
i
took
out
my
now
i
did
not
possess
twenty
cents
and
i
knew
it
still
i
fingered
among
its
compartments
as
if
in
search
of
the
little
gold
dollars
that
were
not
there
you
the
change
enquired
smith
at
the
same
time
drawing
forth
his
purse
through
the
meshes
of
which
the
gold
and
silver
coin
glittered
in
the
gas
light
no
dear
i
replied
feeling
instant
relief
help
yourself
said
he
as
he
tossed
the
purse
to
my
side
of
the
table
i
was
not
long
in
accepting
the
invitation
you
may
be
sure
do
think
said
i
after
bridget
had
retired
that
i
am
one
of
those
who
grudge
the
toiling
poor
the
meagre
wages
they
earn
i
presume
i
looked
as
i
spoke
a
little
annoyed
the
fact
is
to
tell
the
honest
truth
i
have
not
a
dollar
in
my
this
with
the
not
very
pleasant
consciousness
of
having
spent
several
dollars
rather
foolishly
fretted
me
when
the
just
demand
of
the
washerwoman
came
i
will
exonerate
my
wife
from
any
suspicion
of
grinding
the
faces
of
the
poor
smith
spoke
promptly
and
with
some
earnestness
of
manner
after
a
slight
pause
he
continued
some
people
have
a
singular
reluctance
to
part
with
money
if
waited
on
for
a
bill
they
say
almost
involuntarily
even
though
their
pockets
are
far
from
being
empty
i
once
fell
into
this
bad
habit
myself
but
a
little
incident
which
i
will
relate
cured
me
not
many
years
after
i
had
attained
my
majority
a
poor
widow
named
blake
did
my
washing
and
ironing
she
was
the
mother
of
two
or
three
little
children
whose
sole
dependance
for
food
and
raiment
was
on
the
labor
of
her
hands
punctually
every
thursday
morning
blake
appeared
with
my
clothes
as
the
driven
snow
but
not
always
as
punctually
did
i
pay
the
pittance
she
had
earned
by
hard
labor
blake
is
down
stairs
said
a
servant
tapping
at
my
room
door
one
morning
while
i
was
in
the
act
of
dressing
myself
very
well
i
replied
her
to
leave
my
clothes
i
will
get
them
when
i
come
down
the
thought
of
paying
the
cents
her
due
crossed
my
mind
but
i
said
to
myself
but
a
small
matter
and
will
do
as
well
when
she
comes
again
there
was
in
this
a
certain
reluctance
to
part
with
money
my
funds
were
low
and
i
might
need
what
change
i
had
during
the
day
and
so
it
proved
as
i
went
to
the
office
in
which
i
was
engaged
some
small
article
of
ornament
caught
my
eye
in
a
shop
window
said
i
as
i
stood
looking
at
it
admiration
quickly
changed
into
the
desire
for
possession
and
so
i
stepped
in
to
ask
the
price
it
was
just
two
dollars
enough
thought
i
and
this
very
cheapness
was
a
further
temptation
so
i
turned
out
the
contents
of
my
pockets
counted
them
over
and
found
the
amount
to
be
two
dollars
and
a
quarter
guess
i
take
it
said
i
laying
the
money
on
the
shopkeeper
counter
have
paid
mrs
blake
this
thought
crossed
my
mind
an
hour
afterwards
by
which
time
the
little
ornament
had
lost
its
power
of
pleasing
much
would
at
least
have
been
saved
i
was
leaving
the
table
after
tea
on
the
evening
that
followed
when
the
waiter
said
to
me
blake
is
at
the
door
and
wishes
to
see
you
i
felt
worried
at
hearing
this
for
there
was
no
change
in
my
pockets
and
the
poor
washerwoman
had
of
course
come
for
her
money
in
a
great
hurry
i
muttered
to
myself
as
i
descended
to
the
door
have
to
wait
until
you
bring
home
my
clothes
next
week
mrs
blake
i
hav
any
change
this
evening
the
expression
of
the
poor
woman
face
as
she
turned
slowly
away
without
speaking
rather
softened
my
feelings
sorry
said
i
it
ca
be
helped
now
i
wish
you
had
said
this
morning
that
you
wanted
money
i
could
have
paid
you
then
she
paused
and
turned
partly
towards
me
as
i
said
this
then
she
moved
off
with
something
so
sad
in
her
manner
that
i
was
touched
sensibly
ought
to
have
paid
her
this
morning
when
i
had
the
change
about
me
and
i
wish
i
had
done
so
why
did
she
ask
for
her
money
if
she
wanted
it
so
badly
i
felt
of
coarse
rather
ill
at
ease
a
little
while
afterwards
i
met
the
lady
with
whom
i
was
boarding
you
know
anything
about
this
blake
who
washes
for
me
i
enquired
much
except
that
she
is
very
poor
and
has
three
children
to
feed
and
clothe
and
what
is
worst
of
all
she
is
in
bad
health
i
think
she
told
me
this
morning
that
one
of
her
little
ones
was
very
sick
i
was
smitten
with
a
feeling
of
and
soon
after
left
the
room
it
was
too
late
to
remedy
the
evil
for
i
had
only
a
sixpence
in
my
pocket
and
moreover
i
did
not
know
where
to
find
blake
having
purposed
to
make
a
call
upon
some
young
ladies
that
evening
i
now
went
up
into
my
room
to
dress
upon
my
bed
lay
the
spotless
linen
brought
home
by
blake
in
the
morning
the
sight
of
it
rebuked
me
and
i
had
to
conquer
with
some
force
an
instinctive
reluctance
before
i
could
compel
myself
to
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
vest
too
recently
from
the
hand
of
my
unpaid
washerwoman
one
of
the
young
ladies
upon
whom
i
called
was
more
than
a
mere
pleasant
acquaintance
and
here
smith
glanced
with
a
tender
smile
towards
me
my
heart
had
in
fact
been
warming
towards
her
for
some
time
and
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
find
favor
in
her
eyes
on
this
evening
she
was
lovelier
and
more
attractive
than
ever
judge
then
of
the
effect
produced
upon
me
by
the
entrance
of
her
mother
at
the
very
moment
when
my
heart
was
all
with
love
who
said
as
she
came
in
dear
this
is
a
strange
world
new
feature
have
you
discovered
now
mother
asked
one
of
her
daughters
smiling
new
one
child
but
an
old
one
that
looks
more
repulsive
than
ever
was
answered
blake
came
to
see
me
just
now
in
great
trouble
about
mother
all
the
young
ladies
at
once
manifested
unusual
interest
blushes
came
instantly
to
my
countenance
upon
which
the
eyes
of
the
mother
turned
themselves
as
i
felt
with
a
severe
scrutiny
old
story
in
cases
like
hers
was
answered
get
her
money
when
earned
although
for
daily
bread
she
is
dependent
on
her
daily
labor
with
no
food
in
the
house
or
money
to
buy
medicine
for
her
sick
child
she
was
compelled
to
seek
me
and
to
humble
her
spirit
which
is
an
independent
one
so
low
as
to
ask
bread
for
her
little
ones
and
the
loan
of
a
pittance
with
which
to
get
what
the
doctor
has
ordered
for
her
feeble
sufferer
at
home
what
a
shame
fell
from
the
lips
of
her
in
whom
my
heart
felt
more
than
a
passing
interest
and
she
looked
at
me
earnestly
as
she
spoke
fully
expected
said
the
mother
get
a
trifle
that
was
due
her
from
a
young
man
who
boards
with
corwin
and
she
went
to
see
him
this
evening
but
he
put
her
off
with
some
excuse
how
strange
that
any
one
should
be
so
thoughtless
as
to
withhold
from
the
poor
their
pittance
it
is
but
a
small
sum
at
best
that
the
toiling
seamstress
or
washerwoman
can
gain
by
her
wearying
labor
that
at
least
should
be
promptly
paid
to
withhold
it
an
hour
is
to
do
in
many
cases
a
great
wrong
for
some
minutes
after
this
was
said
there
ensued
a
dead
silence
i
felt
that
the
thoughts
of
all
were
turned
upon
me
as
the
one
who
had
withheld
from
poor
blake
the
trifling
sum
due
her
for
washing
what
my
feelings
were
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
describe
and
difficult
for
any
one
never
himself
placed
in
so
unpleasant
a
position
to
imagine
my
relief
was
great
when
the
conversation
flowed
on
again
and
in
another
channel
for
i
then
perceived
that
suspicion
did
not
rest
upon
me
you
may
be
sure
that
blake
had
her
money
before
ten
on
the
next
day
and
that
i
never
again
fell
into
the
error
of
neglecting
for
a
single
week
my
poor
washerwoman
such
a
confession
from
you
smith
of
all
men
said
i
feeling
a
little
uncomfortable
that
he
should
have
told
this
story
of
himself
we
are
none
of
us
perfect
he
answered
he
is
best
who
conscious
of
natural
defects
and
evils
strives
against
and
overcomes
them
chapter
xxviii
my
borrowing
neighbor
i
think
my
dear
said
i
to
my
husband
one
day
that
we
shall
have
to
move
from
here
why
so
asked
smith
in
surprise
it
is
a
very
comfortable
house
i
am
certain
we
will
not
get
another
as
desirable
at
the
same
rent
i
do
know
that
we
will
but
just
as
i
said
this
my
cook
opened
the
door
of
the
room
where
we
were
sitting
and
said
jordon
wants
to
borrow
half
a
pound
of
butter
she
says
they
are
entirely
out
and
their
wo
come
before
very
well
bridget
let
her
have
it
the
cook
retired
why
do
you
wish
to
move
jane
asked
my
husband
as
the
girl
closed
the
door
cook
visit
was
quite
apropos
i
replied
it
is
on
account
of
the
pound
of
butter
of
sugar
and
of
nuisance
i
do
exactly
comprehend
you
jane
said
my
husband
it
is
to
get
rid
of
a
borrowing
neighbor
the
fact
is
jordon
is
almost
too
much
for
me
i
like
to
be
accommodating
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
oblige
my
neighbors
i
am
ready
to
give
any
reasonable
obedience
to
the
scripture
injunction
him
that
would
borrow
of
thee
turn
thou
not
but
jordon
goes
beyond
all
reason
still
if
she
is
punctual
in
returning
what
she
gets
i
do
know
that
you
ought
to
let
it
annoy
you
a
great
deal
there
lies
the
gist
of
the
matter
my
dear
i
replied
if
there
were
no
such
as
you
suggest
in
the
case
i
would
not
think
a
great
deal
about
it
but
the
fact
is
there
is
no
telling
the
cups
of
sugar
pans
of
flour
pounds
of
butter
and
little
matters
of
salt
pepper
vinegar
mustard
ginger
spices
eggs
lard
meal
and
the
dear
knows
what
all
that
go
out
monthly
but
never
come
back
again
i
verily
believe
we
suffer
through
jordon
habit
of
borrowing
not
less
than
fifty
or
sixty
dollars
a
year
little
things
like
these
count
up
so
bad
as
that
is
it
said
my
husband
indeed
it
is
and
when
she
returns
anything
it
is
almost
always
of
an
inferior
quality
and
frequently
thrown
away
on
that
account
while
we
were
talking
the
tea
bell
rang
and
we
retired
to
the
what
the
matter
with
this
tea
asked
smith
pushing
the
cup
i
had
handed
him
aside
after
leaving
sipped
of
its
contents
i
never
tasted
such
stuff
it
like
herb
tea
it
must
be
something
in
the
water
replied
i
the
tea
is
the
same
we
have
been
using
all
along
i
poured
some
into
a
cup
and
tasted
it
pah
i
said
with
disgust
and
rang
the
bell
the
cook
entered
in
a
few
moments
bridget
what
the
matter
with
your
tea
it
is
fit
to
drink
is
it
the
same
we
have
been
using
no
replied
bridget
it
is
some
jordon
sent
home
i
reminded
nancy
when
she
was
here
for
butter
that
they
owed
us
some
tea
borrowed
day
before
yesterday
and
she
came
right
back
with
it
saying
that
jordon
was
sorry
it
had
slipped
her
mind
i
thought
i
would
draw
it
by
itself
and
not
mix
it
with
the
tea
in
our
canister
you
can
throw
this
out
and
draw
fresh
tea
bridget
we
ca
drink
it
said
i
handing
her
the
you
see
how
it
works
i
remarked
as
bridget
left
the
room
and
my
husband
leaned
back
in
his
chair
to
wait
for
a
fresh
cup
of
tea
one
half
of
the
time
when
anything
is
returned
we
ca
use
it
the
butter
jordon
got
a
little
while
ago
if
returned
will
not
be
fit
to
go
on
our
table
we
can
only
use
it
for
cooking
it
is
right
sententiously
remarked
my
husband
the
fact
is
he
resumed
after
a
slight
pause
i
would
lend
such
a
woman
anything
it
is
a
downright
imposition
it
is
a
very
easy
thing
to
say
that
smith
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
do
it
i
do
believe
jordon
means
to
do
wrong
or
is
really
conscious
that
she
is
trespassing
upon
us
some
people
do
reflect
otherwise
she
is
a
pleasant
neighbor
and
i
like
her
very
much
it
is
want
of
proper
thought
smith
and
nothing
else
if
a
man
kept
treading
on
my
gouty
toe
for
want
of
thought
said
my
husband
i
should
certainly
tell
him
of
it
whether
he
got
offended
i
or
not
if
his
friendship
could
only
be
retained
on
these
terms
i
would
prefer
dispensing
with
the
favor
the
case
is
exactly
parallel
smith
was
my
reply
the
gouty
toe
and
crushing
heel
are
very
palpable
and
straightforward
matters
and
a
man
would
be
an
egregious
blockhead
to
be
offended
when
reminded
of
the
pain
he
was
inflicting
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
jordon
at
all
conscious
of
the
extent
of
her
very
many
of
which
in
fact
are
indirect
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
and
arise
from
her
general
sanction
of
the
borrowing
system
i
do
not
suppose
for
a
moment
that
she
knows
about
everything
that
is
borrowed
if
she
does
pray
who
does
inquired
my
husband
her
servants
i
have
to
be
as
watchful
as
you
can
imagine
to
see
that
bridget
excellent
a
girl
as
she
is
does
suffer
things
to
get
out
and
then
at
the
last
moment
when
it
is
too
late
to
send
to
the
store
run
in
to
a
neighbor
and
borrow
to
hide
her
neglect
if
i
gave
her
a
for
borrowing
i
might
be
as
annoying
to
my
neighbors
as
mrs
jordon
that
a
rather
serious
matter
said
my
husband
in
fact
there
is
no
knowing
how
much
people
may
suffer
in
their
neighbors
good
opinion
through
the
misconduct
of
their
servants
in
this
very
thing
truly
said
and
now
let
me
relate
a
fact
about
jordon
that
illustrates
your
remark
the
fresh
tea
had
come
in
and
we
were
going
on
with
our
evening
meal
a
few
weeks
ago
we
had
some
friends
here
spending
the
evening
when
about
serving
refreshments
i
discovered
that
my
two
dozen
tumblers
had
been
reduced
to
seven
or
eight
on
inquiry
i
learned
that
jordon
had
ten
the
rest
had
been
broken
i
sent
to
her
with
my
compliments
and
asked
her
to
return
them
as
i
had
some
company
and
wished
to
use
them
in
serving
refreshments
bridget
was
gone
some
time
and
when
she
returned
said
that
jordon
at
first
denied
having
any
of
my
tumblers
her
cook
was
called
who
acknowledged
to
five
and
after
sundry
efforts
on
the
part
of
bridget
to
refresh
her
memory
finally
gave
in
to
the
whole
ten
early
on
the
next
morning
jordon
came
in
to
see
me
and
seemed
a
good
deal
mortified
about
the
tumblers
was
the
first
i
had
heard
about
it
she
said
it
now
appears
borrowed
of
you
to
hide
her
own
breakage
and
i
should
have
been
none
the
wiser
if
you
had
not
sent
in
i
have
not
a
single
tumbler
left
it
is
too
bad
i
do
care
so
much
for
the
loss
of
the
tumblers
as
i
do
for
the
mortifying
position
it
placed
me
in
toward
a
neighbor
upon
my
word
exclaimed
my
husband
that
is
a
beautiful
illustration
sure
enough
of
my
remarks
about
what
people
may
suffer
in
the
good
opinion
of
others
through
the
conduct
of
their
servants
in
this
very
thing
no
doubt
jordon
as
you
suggest
is
guiltless
of
a
good
deal
of
blame
now
laid
at
her
door
it
was
a
fair
opportunity
for
you
to
give
her
some
hints
on
the
subject
you
might
have
opened
her
eyes
a
little
or
at
least
diminished
the
annoyance
you
had
been
and
still
are
enduring
yes
the
opportunity
was
a
good
one
and
i
ought
to
have
improved
it
but
i
did
not
and
the
whole
system
sanctioned
or
not
sanctioned
by
jordon
is
in
force
against
me
and
will
continue
unless
some
means
be
adopted
by
which
to
abate
the
nuisance
seriously
smith
said
i
i
am
clear
for
removing
from
the
neighborhood
but
smith
said
nonsense
jane
a
form
of
expression
he
uses
when
he
wishes
to
say
that
my
proposition
or
suggestion
is
perfectly
ridiculous
and
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
what
is
to
be
done
i
asked
bear
the
evil
correct
it
if
you
can
and
if
not
bear
it
the
best
i
can
yes
that
is
my
advice
this
was
about
the
extent
of
aid
i
ever
received
from
my
husband
in
any
of
my
domestic
difficulties
he
is
a
abstractionist
and
can
see
to
a
hair
how
others
ought
to
act
in
every
imaginable
and
i
was
going
to
say
unimaginable
case
but
is
just
as
backward
about
telling
people
what
he
thinks
of
them
and
making
everybody
with
whom
he
has
anything
to
do
toe
the
mark
as
i
am
as
the
idea
of
moving
to
get
rid
of
my
borrowing
neighbor
was
considered
perfect
nonsense
by
smith
i
began
to
think
seriously
how
i
should
check
the
evil
now
grown
almost
insufferable
on
the
next
morning
the
was
borrowed
to
begin
with
has
jordon
got
a
of
her
own
i
asked
of
bridget
yes
she
replied
but
it
is
such
a
poor
one
that
nancy
wo
use
it
she
says
it
takes
her
forever
and
a
day
to
grind
enough
coffee
for
breakfast
does
she
get
ours
every
morning
yes
nancy
opened
the
kitchen
door
at
this
moment
our
back
gates
were
side
by
side
and
said
jordon
says
will
you
oblige
her
so
much
as
to
let
her
have
an
egg
to
clear
the
coffee
i
forgot
to
tell
her
yesterday
that
ours
were
all
gone
certainly
i
said
bridget
give
nancy
an
egg
jordon
is
very
sorry
to
trouble
you
smith
said
nancy
in
a
little
while
and
finding
me
still
in
the
kitchen
but
she
says
if
you
will
lend
her
a
bowl
of
sugar
it
will
be
a
great
accommodation
i
forgot
to
tell
her
yesterday
that
the
sugar
was
all
gone
you
appear
to
be
rather
forgetful
of
such
matters
nancy
i
could
not
help
saying
i
know
i
am
a
little
forgetful
the
girl
said
good
humoredly
but
i
have
so
much
to
do
that
i
hardly
have
time
to
think
where
is
the
large
earthen
dish
that
you
use
sometimes
in
making
bread
i
asked
after
jordon
cook
had
withdrawn
missing
it
from
its
usual
place
on
the
shelf
nancy
borrowed
it
last
week
why
do
she
bring
it
home
i
told
her
about
it
three
or
four
times
nancy
opened
the
door
again
please
to
let
jordon
have
another
half
pound
of
butter
we
have
enough
to
do
for
breakfast
and
the
butter
man
do
come
until
the
middle
of
the
day
of
course
i
could
refuse
though
i
believe
i
granted
the
request
with
no
very
smiling
grace
i
heard
no
more
of
nancy
until
toward
i
had
given
my
cook
orders
not
to
lend
her
anything
more
without
first
coming
to
me
jordon
has
sent
in
to
know
if
you
wo
lend
her
two
or
three
scuttles
full
of
coal
said
bridget
jordon
was
to
have
sent
home
the
fires
are
going
down
certainly
i
replied
let
her
have
it
but
i
want
you
to
see
that
it
is
returned
as
to
that
i
do
my
best
but
i
ca
get
nancy
to
return
one
half
what
she
borrows
she
forgets
from
one
day
to
another
she
must
forget
i
returned
warmly
you
must
go
to
jordon
yourself
it
is
right
i
shall
have
to
go
i
guess
before
i
able
to
get
back
a
dozen
kitchen
things
of
ours
they
have
i
never
saw
such
borrowing
people
and
then
never
to
think
of
returning
what
they
get
they
have
got
one
of
our
pokers
the
big
and
the
our
muffin
rings
they
had
these
three
months
every
monday
they
get
two
of
our
tubs
and
the
yesterday
they
sent
in
and
got
our
large
belonging
to
the
and
have
sent
it
home
yet
indeed
i
ca
tell
you
all
they
got
let
nancy
have
the
coal
said
i
but
we
must
stop
this
in
some
way
if
it
be
possible
for
three
or
four
days
the
same
thing
was
kept
up
until
i
lost
all
patience
and
resolved
offence
or
no
offence
to
end
a
system
that
was
both
annoying
and
unjust
jordon
called
in
to
see
me
one
day
and
sat
conversing
in
a
very
pleasant
strain
for
an
hour
she
was
an
agreeable
companion
and
i
was
pleased
with
the
visit
in
fact
i
liked
jordon
about
an
hour
after
she
was
gone
nancy
came
into
the
kitchen
where
i
happened
to
be
what
wanted
now
said
i
my
voice
expressed
quite
as
much
as
my
words
i
saw
the
color
flush
in
nancy
face
jordon
says
will
you
please
to
lend
her
a
pan
of
flour
she
will
return
it
tell
jordon
i
replied
that
we
are
going
to
make
up
bread
this
afternoon
and
have
more
than
enough
flour
left
or
i
would
let
her
have
what
she
wants
and
by
the
way
nancy
tell
jordon
that
i
will
be
obliged
to
her
if
she
will
send
in
my
large
earthen
dish
we
want
to
use
it
nancy
did
seem
pleased
and
i
thought
she
muttered
something
to
herself
as
she
went
away
not
five
minutes
elapsed
before
word
came
to
my
room
that
jordon
was
in
the
parlor
and
wished
to
speak
to
me
now
for
trouble
thought
i
sure
enough
when
i
entered
the
parlor
the
knit
brow
flushed
face
and
angry
eyes
of
my
neighbor
told
me
that
there
was
to
be
a
scene
smith
she
began
without
ceremony
or
apology
for
her
abruptness
of
manner
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
mean
by
the
manner
in
which
you
refused
to
let
me
have
a
little
flour
just
now
how
did
i
refuse
i
was
cool
enough
to
inquire
you
refused
in
a
manner
which
plainly
enough
snowed
that
you
thought
me
a
troublesome
borrower
wanted
now
i
think
rather
strange
language
to
use
to
a
domestic
of
mine
really
thought
i
this
caps
the
climax
to
speak
the
plain
truth
jordon
said
i
and
not
wishing
to
give
any
offence
you
do
use
the
privilege
of
a
neighbor
in
this
respect
rather
freely
more
freely
i
must
own
than
i
feel
justified
in
doing
smith
this
is
too
much
exclaimed
jordon
why
you
borrow
of
me
twice
where
i
borrow
of
you
once
i
am
particularly
careful
in
matters
of
this
kind
i
looked
at
the
woman
with
amazement
borrow
of
you
i
asked
certainly
she
replied
with
perfect
coolness
scarcely
a
day
passes
that
you
do
not
send
in
for
something
or
other
but
dear
knows
i
have
always
felt
pleasure
in
obliging
you
i
was
mute
for
a
time
really
jordon
said
i
at
length
as
composedly
as
i
could
speak
you
seem
to
be
laboring
under
some
strange
mistake
the
charge
of
frequent
borrowing
i
imagine
lies
all
on
the
other
side
i
can
name
a
dozen
of
my
things
in
your
house
now
and
can
mention
as
many
articles
borrowed
within
the
last
three
days
pray
do
so
was
her
cool
reply
you
have
my
large
i
replied
and
two
of
my
washing
tubs
you
borrow
them
every
monday
and
i
have
almost
always
to
send
for
them
i
have
your
and
tubs
you
are
in
error
smith
i
have
a
large
boiler
of
my
own
and
plenty
of
tubs
i
do
know
what
you
have
jordon
but
i
do
know
that
you
get
mine
every
week
excuse
me
for
mentioning
these
things
i
do
so
at
your
desire
then
there
is
my
borrowed
every
morning
why
should
i
borrow
your
we
have
one
of
our
own
yesterday
you
borrowed
butter
and
eggs
and
sugar
i
continued
i
my
neighbor
seemed
perfectly
amazed
yes
and
the
day
before
a
loaf
of
bread
an
egg
to
clear
your
coffee
salt
pepper
and
a
nutmeg
never
and
nancy
got
some
lard
a
cup
of
coffee
and
some
indian
meal
for
a
pudding
she
did
asked
jordon
in
a
quick
voice
a
light
seeming
to
have
flashed
upon
her
mind
yes
i
replied
for
i
was
in
the
kitchen
when
she
got
the
lard
and
meal
and
bridget
mentioned
the
coffee
as
soon
as
i
came
down
this
morning
strange
jordon
looked
thoughtful
it
is
a
week
since
we
got
coffee
and
i
am
sure
our
indian
meal
can
not
be
out
almost
every
week
nancy
borrows
a
pound
or
a
half
pound
of
butter
on
the
day
before
your
butter
man
comes
and
more
than
that
return
it
or
indeed
anything
she
gets
more
than
a
third
of
the
time
precisely
the
complaint
i
have
to
make
against
you
said
jordon
looking
me
steadily
in
the
face
then
said
i
there
is
something
wrong
somewhere
for
to
my
knowledge
nothing
has
been
borrowed
from
you
or
any
body
else
for
months
i
forbid
anything
of
the
kind
be
that
as
it
may
smith
nancy
frequently
comes
to
me
and
says
you
have
sent
in
for
this
that
and
the
other
thing
coffee
tea
sugar
butter
and
in
fact
almost
everything
used
in
a
family
then
nancy
gets
them
for
her
own
use
said
i
but
i
have
often
seen
bridget
in
myself
for
things
my
bridget
i
said
in
surprise
i
instantly
rang
the
bell
tell
bridget
i
want
her
said
i
to
the
waiter
who
came
to
the
door
the
cook
soon
appeared
bridget
are
you
in
the
habit
of
borrowing
from
jordon
without
my
knowledge
no
replied
the
girl
firmly
and
without
any
mark
of
disturbance
in
her
face
di
you
get
a
bar
of
soap
from
our
house
yesterday
asked
jordon
yes
returned
bridget
but
it
was
soap
you
owed
us
owed
you
yes
ma
am
nancy
got
a
bar
of
soap
from
me
last
and
i
went
in
for
it
yesterday
but
nancy
told
me
you
wanted
to
borrow
it
said
jordon
nancy
knew
better
said
bridget
with
a
face
slightly
flushed
but
any
one
could
see
that
it
was
a
flush
of
indignation
will
you
step
into
my
house
and
tell
nancy
i
want
to
see
her
certainly
and
bridget
retired
these
servants
have
been
playing
a
high
game
i
fear
remarked
jordon
after
bridget
had
left
the
room
pardon
me
if
in
my
surprise
i
have
spoken
in
a
manner
that
has
seemed
offensive
most
certainly
there
is
a
game
playing
that
i
know
nothing
about
if
anything
has
been
borrowed
of
you
in
my
name
for
these
three
months
said
i
i
have
heard
of
your
borrowing
something
or
other
almost
every
day
during
the
time
you
mention
replied
jordon
as
for
me
i
have
sent
into
you
a
few
times
but
not
oftener
i
am
sure
than
once
in
a
week
bridget
returned
after
having
been
gone
several
minutes
and
said
nancy
would
be
in
directly
we
waited
for
some
time
and
then
sent
for
her
again
word
was
brought
back
that
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
house
come
in
with
me
smith
said
my
neighbor
rising
i
did
so
according
to
her
request
sure
enough
nancy
was
gone
we
went
up
into
her
room
and
found
that
she
had
bundled
up
her
clothes
and
taken
them
off
but
left
behind
her
unmistakable
evidence
of
what
she
had
been
doing
in
an
old
chest
which
jordon
had
let
her
use
for
her
clothes
were
many
packages
of
tea
burnt
coffee
sugar
soap
eggs
a
tin
kettle
containing
a
pound
of
butter
and
various
other
articles
of
table
use
poor
jordon
seemed
bewildered
let
me
look
at
that
pound
lump
of
butter
said
jordon
took
up
the
kettle
containing
it
it
is
my
butter
she
remarked
but
it
mine
and
the
very
pound
she
got
of
me
yesterday
for
you
gracious
me
ejaculated
my
neighbor
was
anything
like
this
ever
heard
she
evidently
borrowed
on
your
credit
and
mine
both
ways
i
remarked
with
a
smile
for
all
my
unkind
feelings
toward
jordon
were
gone
and
for
her
own
benefit
but
is
it
dreadful
to
think
of
smith
see
what
harm
the
creature
has
done
over
and
over
again
have
i
complained
of
your
borrowing
so
much
and
returning
so
little
and
you
have
doubtless
made
the
same
complaint
of
me
i
certainly
have
i
felt
that
i
was
not
justly
dealt
by
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
it
and
jordon
sank
into
a
chair
still
i
do
understand
about
the
and
tubs
that
you
mentioned
she
said
after
a
pause
you
remember
my
ten
tumblers
i
remarked
perfectly
but
can
she
have
broken
up
my
tubs
and
boiler
or
carried
them
off
on
searching
in
the
cellar
we
found
the
tubs
in
ruins
and
the
with
a
large
hole
in
the
bottom
i
shall
never
forget
the
chagrin
anger
and
mortification
of
poor
jordon
when
at
her
request
bridget
pointed
out
at
least
twenty
of
my
domestic
utensils
that
nancy
had
borrowed
to
replace
such
as
she
had
broken
or
carried
away
it
was
a
rule
with
jordon
to
make
her
servants
pay
for
every
thing
they
broke
to
think
of
it
she
repeated
over
and
over
again
just
to
think
of
it
who
could
have
dreamed
of
such
doings
jordon
was
in
fact
as
guiltless
of
the
sin
of
troublesome
borrowing
from
a
neighbor
as
myself
and
yet
i
had
seriously
urged
the
propriety
of
moving
out
of
the
neighborhood
to
get
away
from
her
we
both
looked
more
closely
to
the
doings
of
our
servants
after
this
pretty
severe
lesson
and
i
must
freely
confess
that
in
my
own
case
the
result
was
worth
all
the
trouble
as
trusty
a
girl
as
my
cook
was
i
found
that
she
would
occasionally
run
in
to
a
to
borrow
something
or
other
in
order
to
hide
her
own
neglect
and
i
only
succeeded
in
stopping
the
the
evil
by
threatening
to
send
her
away
if
i
ever
detected
her
in
doing
it
again
chapter
xxix
experience
in
taking
boarders
i
have
no
experiences
of
my
own
to
relate
on
this
subject
but
i
could
fill
a
book
with
the
experiences
of
my
friends
how
many
poor
widows
in
the
hope
of
sustaining
their
families
and
educating
their
children
have
tried
the
illusive
and
at
best
doubtful
experiment
of
taking
boarders
to
find
themselves
in
a
year
or
two
or
three
hopelessly
involved
in
debt
a
life
time
of
labor
would
fail
to
cancel
many
from
pride
resort
to
this
means
of
getting
a
living
because
why
i
never
could
comprehend
taking
boarders
is
thought
to
be
more
genteel
than
needlework
or
keeping
a
small
store
for
the
sale
of
fancy
articles
the
experience
of
one
of
my
friends
a
turner
who
in
the
earlier
days
of
her
sad
widowhood
found
it
needful
to
make
personal
effort
for
the
sustenance
of
her
family
i
will
here
relate
many
who
find
themselves
in
trying
positions
like
hers
may
in
reviewing
her
mistakes
be
saved
from
similar
ones
themselves
i
do
know
what
we
shall
do
exclaimed
turner
about
six
months
after
the
death
of
her
husband
while
pondering
sadly
over
the
prospect
before
her
she
had
one
daughter
about
twenty
and
two
sons
who
were
both
under
ten
years
of
age
up
to
this
time
she
had
never
known
the
dread
of
want
her
husband
had
been
able
to
provide
well
for
his
family
and
they
moved
in
a
very
respectable
and
somewhat
showy
circle
but
on
his
death
his
affairs
were
found
to
be
much
involved
and
when
settled
there
was
left
for
the
widow
and
children
only
about
the
sum
of
four
thousand
dollars
besides
the
household
furniture
which
was
very
handsome
this
sad
falling
off
in
her
prospects
had
been
communicated
to
turner
a
short
time
before
by
the
administrator
on
the
estate
and
its
effect
was
to
alarm
and
sadden
her
extremely
she
knew
nothing
of
business
and
yet
was
painfully
conscious
that
four
thousand
dollars
would
be
but
a
trifle
to
what
she
would
need
for
her
family
and
that
effort
in
some
direction
was
now
absolutely
necessary
but
besides
her
ignorance
of
any
calling
by
which
money
could
be
made
she
had
a
superabundance
of
false
pride
and
shrunk
from
what
she
was
pleased
to
consider
the
odium
attached
to
a
woman
who
had
to
engage
in
business
under
these
circumstances
she
had
a
poor
enough
prospect
before
her
the
exclamation
as
above
recorded
was
made
in
the
presence
of
mary
turner
her
daughter
a
well
educated
girl
who
had
less
of
that
false
pride
which
obscured
her
mother
perceptions
of
right
after
a
few
moments
silence
the
latter
said
and
yet
we
must
do
something
mother
i
know
that
mary
too
well
but
i
know
of
nothing
that
we
can
do
suppose
we
open
a
little
dry
goods
store
suggested
mary
others
seem
to
do
well
at
it
and
we
might
you
know
we
have
a
great
many
friends
do
think
of
it
mary
we
could
not
expose
ourselves
in
that
way
i
know
that
it
would
not
be
pleasant
mother
but
then
we
must
do
something
it
must
be
something
besides
that
mary
i
ca
listen
to
it
only
a
vulgar
class
of
women
who
keep
stores
i
am
willing
to
take
in
sewing
mother
but
then
all
i
could
earn
would
go
but
a
little
way
towards
keeping
the
family
i
suppose
i
could
even
pay
the
rent
and
that
you
know
is
four
hundred
dollars
too
true
turner
said
despondingly
suppose
i
open
a
school
suggested
mary
o
no
no
my
head
would
never
stand
the
noise
and
confusion
and
any
way
i
never
did
like
a
school
then
i
do
know
what
we
shall
do
unless
we
take
some
boarders
a
little
more
genteel
but
even
that
is
low
enough
then
suppose
mother
we
look
for
a
lower
rent
and
try
to
live
more
economically
i
will
take
in
sewing
and
we
can
try
for
awhile
and
see
how
we
get
along
o
no
indeed
child
that
would
never
do
we
must
keep
up
appearances
or
we
shall
lose
our
place
in
society
you
know
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
you
and
your
brothers
that
we
should
maintain
our
position
as
for
me
mother
said
mary
in
a
serious
tone
i
would
not
have
you
to
take
a
thought
in
that
direction
and
it
seems
to
me
that
our
true
position
is
the
one
where
we
can
live
most
comfortably
according
to
our
means
you
do
know
anything
about
it
child
turner
replied
in
a
positive
tone
mary
was
silenced
for
the
time
but
a
banishment
of
the
subject
did
not
in
any
way
lesson
the
difficulties
thoughts
of
these
soon
again
became
apparent
in
words
and
the
most
natural
form
of
these
was
the
sentence
i
do
know
what
we
do
uttered
by
the
mother
in
a
tone
of
deep
despondency
suppose
we
take
a
few
boarders
mary
urged
about
three
weeks
after
the
conversation
just
alluded
to
no
mary
we
would
be
too
much
exposed
and
then
it
would
come
very
hard
on
you
for
you
know
that
i
can
not
stand
much
fatigue
turner
replied
slowly
and
sadly
o
as
to
that
said
mary
with
animation
i
take
all
the
burden
off
of
you
indeed
child
i
can
not
think
of
it
turner
replied
positively
and
again
the
subject
was
dismissed
but
it
was
soon
again
recurred
to
and
after
the
suggestion
and
disapproval
of
many
plans
mary
again
said
indeed
mother
i
do
see
what
we
will
do
unless
we
take
a
few
boarders
it
the
only
thing
at
all
respectable
that
i
can
think
of
turner
said
despondingly
and
i
afraid
it
the
best
we
can
do
i
think
we
had
better
try
it
mother
do
you
well
perhaps
we
had
mary
there
are
four
rooms
that
we
can
spare
and
these
ought
to
bring
us
in
something
handsome
what
ought
we
to
charge
about
three
dollars
and
a
half
for
young
men
and
ten
dollars
for
a
man
and
his
wife
if
we
could
get
four
married
couples
for
the
four
rooms
that
would
be
forty
dollars
a
week
which
would
be
pretty
good
said
mary
warming
at
the
thought
yes
if
we
could
mary
we
might
manage
pretty
well
but
most
married
people
have
children
and
they
are
such
an
annoyance
that
i
would
have
them
in
the
house
we
will
have
to
depend
mainly
on
the
young
men
it
was
probably
three
weeks
after
this
that
an
advertisement
running
thus
appeared
in
one
of
the
newspapers
boarding
five
or
six
genteel
young
men
or
a
few
gentlemen
and
their
wives
can
be
accommodated
with
boarding
at
cedar
street
terms
moderate
in
the
course
of
the
following
day
a
man
called
and
asked
the
terms
for
himself
and
wife
ten
dollars
said
turner
that
too
high
is
it
not
remarked
the
man
we
can
not
take
you
for
less
have
you
a
pleasant
room
vacant
you
can
have
your
choice
of
the
finest
in
the
house
can
i
look
at
them
madam
certainly
sir
and
the
stranger
was
taken
through
beautifully
furnished
chambers
well
this
is
certainly
a
temptation
said
the
man
pausing
and
looking
around
the
front
chamber
on
the
second
floor
and
you
have
named
your
lowest
terms
yes
sir
the
lowest
well
it
higher
than
i
been
paying
but
this
looks
too
comfortable
i
suppose
we
will
have
to
strike
a
bargain
shall
be
pleased
to
accommodate
you
sir
we
will
come
then
morning
very
well
sir
and
the
stranger
departed
so
much
for
a
beginning
said
turner
evidently
gratified
he
seems
to
be
much
of
a
gentleman
if
his
wife
is
like
him
they
will
make
things
very
agreeable
i
am
sure
i
hope
she
is
said
mary
on
the
next
morning
the
new
boarders
made
their
appearance
and
the
lady
proved
as
affable
and
as
interesting
as
the
husband
i
always
pay
quarterly
this
is
the
custom
in
all
the
boarding
houses
i
have
been
in
but
if
your
rules
are
otherwise
why
just
say
so
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
remarked
the
new
boarder
in
the
blandest
manner
imaginable
just
suit
yourself
about
that
cameron
it
is
altogether
immaterial
turner
replied
smiling
i
am
in
no
particular
want
of
money
cameron
bowed
lower
and
smiled
more
blandly
if
possible
than
before
you
have
just
opened
a
boarding
house
i
suppose
madam
he
said
yes
sir
i
am
a
new
beginner
at
the
business
ah
well
i
must
try
and
make
you
known
all
i
can
you
will
find
cameron
here
a
sociable
kind
of
a
woman
and
if
i
can
serve
you
at
any
time
be
sure
to
command
me
you
are
too
kind
turner
responded
much
pleased
to
have
found
in
her
first
boarders
such
excellent
people
in
a
few
days
a
couple
of
young
men
made
application
and
were
received
and
now
commenced
the
serious
duties
of
the
new
undertaking
mary
had
to
assume
the
whole
care
of
the
house
she
had
to
attend
the
markets
and
oversee
the
kitchen
and
also
to
make
with
her
own
hands
all
the
pastry
still
she
had
a
willing
heart
and
this
lightened
much
of
the
heavy
burden
now
imposed
upon
her
how
do
you
like
your
new
boarding
house
asked
a
friend
of
one
of
the
young
men
who
had
applied
and
been
received
this
was
about
two
weeks
after
his
entrance
into
turner
house
elegant
responded
the
young
man
giving
his
countenance
a
peculiar
and
knowing
expression
indeed
but
are
you
in
earnest
i
am
that
why
we
live
on
the
very
fat
of
the
land
pshaw
you
must
be
joking
whoever
heard
of
the
fat
of
the
land
being
found
in
a
boarding
house
they
ca
afford
it
i
do
care
myself
whether
they
can
afford
it
or
not
but
we
do
live
elegantly
i
would
ask
to
sit
down
to
a
better
table
what
kind
of
a
room
have
you
and
what
kind
of
a
bed
good
enough
for
a
lord
nonsense
no
but
i
am
in
earnest
as
i
will
prove
to
you
i
sleep
on
as
fine
a
bed
as
ever
i
saw
laid
on
a
richly
carved
mahogany
bedstead
with
beautiful
curtains
the
floor
is
covered
with
a
brussels
carpet
nearly
new
and
of
a
rich
pattern
there
is
in
the
room
a
mahogany
wardrobe
an
elegant
piece
of
furniture
a
marble
top
dressing
bureau
and
a
mahogany
with
a
marble
slab
now
if
you
do
call
that
a
touch
above
a
common
boarding
house
you
been
more
fortunate
than
i
have
been
until
lately
are
there
any
vacancies
there
tom
there
is
another
bed
in
my
room
well
just
tell
them
that
i
be
there
morning
very
well
and
i
know
of
a
couple
more
that
add
to
the
mess
if
there
is
room
it
a
large
house
and
i
believe
they
have
room
yet
to
spare
a
week
more
passed
away
and
the
house
had
its
complement
six
young
men
and
the
polite
gentleman
and
his
wife
this
promised
an
income
of
dollars
per
week
as
an
to
this
a
careful
examination
into
the
weekly
expenditure
would
have
shown
a
statement
something
like
the
following
marketing
groceries
flour
rent
servants
chambermaid
and
black
boy
fuel
and
incidental
expenses
in
all
per
week
besides
this
their
own
clothes
and
the
schooling
of
the
two
boys
did
not
cost
less
than
at
the
rate
of
per
annum
but
neither
turner
nor
mary
ever
thought
that
any
such
calculation
was
necessary
they
charged
what
other
boarding
house
keepers
charged
and
thought
of
course
that
they
must
make
a
good
living
but
in
no
boarding
house
even
where
much
higher
prices
were
obtained
was
so
much
piled
upon
the
table
every
thing
in
its
season
was
to
be
found
there
without
regard
to
prices
of
course
the
boarders
were
delighted
and
complimented
turner
upon
the
excellent
fare
which
they
received
and
cameron
continued
as
affable
and
interesting
as
when
they
first
came
into
the
house
but
the
first
quarter
passed
away
and
nothing
was
said
about
their
bill
and
turner
never
thought
of
giving
them
a
polite
hint
two
of
her
young
men
were
also
remiss
in
this
respect
but
they
were
such
gentlemanly
polite
attentive
individuals
that
of
course
nothing
could
be
said
i
believe
i
never
had
your
bill
turner
have
i
cameron
said
to
her
one
evening
when
about
six
months
had
passed
no
i
have
never
thought
of
handing
it
in
but
it
no
difference
i
not
in
want
of
money
yes
but
it
ought
to
be
paid
i
bring
you
up
a
check
from
the
in
a
few
days
suit
your
own
convenience
cameron
answered
turner
in
an
indifferent
tone
o
it
perfectly
convenient
at
all
times
but
knowing
that
you
were
not
in
want
of
it
has
made
me
negligent
this
was
all
that
was
said
on
the
subject
for
another
quarter
during
which
time
the
two
young
men
alluded
to
as
being
in
arrears
went
off
cheating
the
widow
out
of
fifty
dollars
each
but
nothing
was
said
about
it
to
the
other
boarders
and
none
of
them
knew
of
the
wrong
that
had
been
sustained
their
places
did
not
fill
up
and
the
promised
weekly
income
was
reduced
to
dollars
at
the
end
of
the
third
quarter
cameron
again
recollected
that
he
had
neglected
to
bring
up
a
check
from
the
and
blamed
himself
for
his
thoughtlessness
i
am
so
full
of
business
said
he
that
i
sometimes
neglect
these
little
things
but
it
a
downright
shame
cameron
when
it
so
easy
for
you
to
draw
off
a
check
and
put
it
into
your
pocket
remarked
his
wife
o
it
not
a
particle
of
difference
turner
volunteered
to
say
smiling
though
to
tell
the
truth
she
would
much
rather
have
had
the
money
well
i
try
and
bear
it
in
mind
this
very
night
and
cameron
hurried
away
as
business
pressed
the
morning
after
cameron
fourth
quarter
expired
he
walked
out
as
usual
with
his
wife
before
breakfast
but
when
all
assembled
at
the
table
they
had
not
something
very
uncommon
for
them
returned
i
wonder
what
keeps
and
mrs
cameron
remarked
turner
why
i
saw
them
leave
in
the
steamboat
for
the
south
this
morning
said
one
of
the
boarders
you
must
be
mistaken
turner
replied
o
no
not
at
all
i
saw
them
and
conversed
with
them
before
the
boat
started
they
told
me
that
they
were
going
on
as
far
as
washington
very
strange
ejaculated
turner
they
said
nothing
to
me
about
it
i
hope
they
do
owe
you
any
thing
remarked
one
of
the
boarders
indeed
they
do
not
much
i
hope
over
five
hundred
dollars
o
that
is
too
bad
how
could
you
trust
a
man
like
cameron
to
such
an
amount
why
surely
said
turner
he
is
a
respectable
and
a
responsible
merchant
and
i
was
in
no
want
of
the
money
indeed
turner
he
is
no
such
thing
then
what
is
he
he
is
one
of
your
gentlemen
about
town
and
lives
i
suppose
by
gambling
at
least
such
is
the
reputation
he
bears
i
thought
you
perfectly
understood
this
how
cruelly
i
have
been
deceived
said
turner
unable
to
command
her
feelings
and
rising
she
left
the
table
in
charge
of
mary
on
examining
and
cameron
room
their
trunk
was
found
but
it
was
empty
the
owners
of
it
of
course
came
not
back
to
claim
their
property
the
result
of
this
year
experience
in
keeping
boarders
was
an
income
of
just
in
money
and
a
loss
of
set
off
against
an
expense
of
thus
was
turner
worse
off
by
at
the
end
of
the
year
than
she
was
when
she
commenced
keeping
boarders
but
she
made
no
estimates
and
had
not
the
most
remote
idea
of
how
the
matter
stood
whenever
she
wanted
money
she
drew
upon
the
amount
placed
to
her
credit
in
bank
by
the
administrator
on
her
estate
vainly
imagining
that
it
would
all
come
back
through
the
boarders
all
that
she
supposed
to
be
lost
of
the
first
business
were
the
out
of
which
she
had
been
cheated
resolving
to
be
more
circumspect
in
future
another
year
was
entered
upon
but
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
mary
was
suffering
from
hard
labor
and
close
confinement
and
it
pained
her
exceedingly
one
day
she
said
to
her
a
few
weeks
after
they
had
entered
upon
the
second
year
i
am
afraid
mary
this
is
too
hard
for
you
you
begin
to
look
pale
and
thin
you
must
spare
yourself
more
i
believe
i
do
need
a
little
rest
mother
said
mary
but
if
i
do
look
after
things
nobody
will
and
then
we
should
soon
have
our
boarders
dissatisfied
that
is
too
true
mary
but
i
would
mind
it
so
much
mother
if
i
thought
we
were
getting
ahead
but
i
am
afraid
we
are
not
what
makes
you
think
so
child
you
know
we
have
lost
six
hundred
dollars
already
and
that
is
a
great
deal
of
money
true
mary
but
we
must
be
more
careful
in
future
we
will
soon
make
that
up
i
am
sure
i
hope
so
mary
responded
with
a
sigh
she
did
not
herself
feel
so
sanguine
of
making
it
up
still
she
had
not
entered
into
any
calculation
of
income
and
expense
leaving
that
to
her
mother
and
supposing
that
all
was
right
as
a
matter
of
course
as
they
continued
to
set
an
excellent
table
they
kept
up
pretty
regularly
their
complement
of
boarders
the
end
of
the
second
year
would
have
shown
this
result
if
a
calculation
had
been
made
cash
income
loss
by
boarders
whole
expenses
consequently
they
were
worse
off
at
the
end
of
the
year
by
or
in
the
two
years
by
keeping
boarders
and
now
poor
turner
was
startled
on
receiving
her
bank
book
from
the
bank
settled
up
to
find
that
her
four
thousand
dollars
had
dwindled
down
to
she
could
not
at
first
believe
her
senses
but
there
were
all
her
checks
regularly
entered
and
to
dash
even
the
hope
that
there
was
a
mistake
there
were
the
cancelled
checks
also
bearing
her
own
signature
mary
what
we
do
was
her
despairing
question
as
the
full
truth
became
distinct
to
her
mind
you
say
we
have
sunk
more
than
two
thousand
dollars
in
two
years
yes
my
child
and
have
had
all
our
hard
labor
for
nothing
mary
continued
and
her
voice
trembled
as
she
thought
of
how
much
she
had
gone
through
in
that
time
yes
something
must
be
wrong
mother
let
us
do
what
we
should
have
done
at
first
make
a
careful
estimate
of
our
expenses
well
it
costs
us
just
ten
dollars
each
week
for
marketing
and
i
know
that
our
groceries
are
at
least
that
including
flour
that
you
see
makes
twenty
dollars
and
we
only
get
dollars
for
our
eight
boarders
our
rent
will
bring
our
expenses
up
to
that
and
then
there
are
servants
wages
fuel
our
own
clothes
and
the
schooling
besides
what
we
lose
every
year
and
the
hundred
little
expenses
which
can
not
be
enumerated
bless
me
mary
no
wonder
we
have
gone
behindhand
indeed
mother
it
is
not
we
have
acted
very
blindly
mary
yes
we
have
but
we
must
do
so
no
longer
let
us
give
up
our
boarders
and
move
into
a
smaller
house
but
what
shall
we
do
mary
our
money
will
soon
dwindle
away
we
must
do
something
for
a
living
mother
that
is
true
but
if
we
can
not
now
see
what
we
shall
do
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
go
on
as
we
are
our
rent
you
know
takes
away
from
us
eight
dollars
a
week
we
can
get
a
house
large
enough
for
our
own
purposes
at
three
dollars
a
week
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
year
i
am
sure
thus
saving
five
dollars
a
week
there
and
that
money
would
buy
all
the
plain
food
our
whole
family
would
eat
but
it
will
never
do
mary
for
us
to
go
to
moving
into
a
little
bit
of
a
of
a
house
mother
if
we
do
get
into
a
cheaper
house
and
husband
our
resources
we
shall
soon
have
no
house
to
live
in
said
mary
with
unwonted
energy
well
child
perhaps
you
are
right
but
i
ca
bear
the
thought
of
it
turner
replied
and
any
how
i
ca
see
what
we
are
going
to
do
then
we
ought
to
do
what
we
see
to
be
right
mother
had
we
not
mary
asked
looking
affectionately
into
her
mother
face
i
suppose
so
mary
wo
it
be
right
for
us
to
reduce
our
expenses
and
make
the
most
of
what
we
have
left
it
certainly
will
mary
then
let
us
do
what
seems
to
be
right
and
we
shall
see
further
i
am
sure
as
soon
as
we
have
acted
thus
urged
turner
consented
to
relinquish
her
boarders
and
to
move
into
a
small
house
at
a
rent
very
considerably
reduced
many
articles
of
furniture
they
were
obliged
to
dispose
of
and
this
added
to
their
little
fund
some
five
hundred
dollars
about
two
months
after
they
were
fairly
settled
mary
said
to
her
mother
i
been
thinking
a
good
deal
lately
mother
about
getting
into
something
that
would
bring
us
in
a
living
well
child
what
conclusion
have
you
come
to
you
do
like
the
idea
of
setting
up
a
little
store
no
mary
it
is
too
exposing
nor
of
keeping
a
school
no
well
what
do
you
think
of
my
learning
the
business
nonsense
mary
but
mother
i
could
learn
in
six
months
and
then
we
could
set
up
the
business
and
i
am
sure
we
could
do
well
almost
every
one
who
sets
up
gets
along
there
was
always
something
low
to
me
in
the
idea
of
a
milliner
or
mantua
maker
and
i
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
your
being
one
turner
replied
in
a
decided
tone
you
know
what
pope
says
mother
and
shame
from
no
rise
act
well
your
part
there
all
the
honor
lies
yes
but
that
is
poetry
child
and
song
is
but
the
eloquence
of
truth
some
one
has
beautifully
said
responded
mary
smiling
the
mother
was
silent
and
mary
whose
mind
had
never
imbibed
fully
her
mother
false
notions
continued
i
am
sure
there
can
be
no
wrong
in
my
making
dresses
some
one
must
make
them
and
it
is
the
end
we
have
in
view
it
seems
to
me
that
determines
the
character
of
an
action
if
i
for
the
sake
of
procuring
an
honest
living
for
my
mother
my
little
brothers
and
myself
am
willing
to
devote
my
time
to
instead
of
sitting
in
idleness
and
suffering
james
and
willie
to
be
put
out
among
strangers
then
the
calling
is
to
me
honorable
my
aim
is
honorable
and
the
means
are
honest
is
it
not
so
mother
yes
i
suppose
it
is
so
but
then
there
was
always
something
so
degrading
to
me
in
the
idea
of
being
nothing
but
a
just
at
that
moment
a
young
man
named
martin
who
had
lived
with
them
during
the
last
year
of
their
experiment
in
keeping
boarders
called
in
to
see
them
he
kept
a
store
in
the
city
and
was
reputed
to
be
well
off
he
had
uniformly
manifested
an
interest
in
turner
and
her
family
and
was
much
liked
by
them
after
he
was
seated
turner
said
to
him
i
am
trying
martin
to
beat
a
strange
notion
out
of
head
she
has
been
endeavouring
to
persuade
me
to
let
her
learn
the
business
the
young
man
seemed
a
little
surprised
at
this
communication
and
mary
evinced
a
momentary
confusion
when
it
was
made
he
said
however
very
promptly
and
pleasantly
turning
to
mary
i
suppose
you
have
a
good
reason
for
it
miss
mary
i
think
i
have
martin
she
replied
smiling
we
can
not
live
and
educate
james
and
william
unless
we
have
a
regular
income
and
i
can
not
shut
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
what
we
have
can
not
last
long
nor
to
another
that
i
am
the
only
one
in
the
family
from
whom
any
regular
income
can
be
expected
and
you
are
willing
to
devote
yourself
to
incessant
toil
night
and
day
for
this
purpose
certainly
i
am
mary
replied
with
a
quiet
cheerful
smile
but
it
never
will
do
martin
will
it
turner
remarked
why
not
mrs
turner
because
it
is
not
altogether
respectable
i
do
not
see
any
thing
disrespectable
in
the
business
but
with
mary
motive
for
entering
into
it
something
highly
respectable
and
honorable
martin
replied
with
unusual
earnestness
turner
was
silenced
and
you
really
think
of
learning
the
business
and
then
setting
it
up
said
martin
turning
to
mary
with
a
manifest
interest
which
she
felt
rather
than
perceived
certainly
i
do
if
mother
does
not
positively
object
then
i
wish
you
all
success
in
your
praiseworthy
undertaking
and
may
the
end
you
have
in
view
support
you
amid
the
wearisome
toil
there
was
a
peculiar
feeling
in
martin
tone
that
touched
the
heart
of
mary
she
knew
not
why
but
certain
it
was
that
she
felt
doubly
nerved
for
the
task
she
had
proposed
to
herself
as
martin
wended
his
way
homeward
that
evening
he
thought
of
mary
turner
with
an
interest
new
to
him
he
had
never
been
a
great
deal
in
her
company
while
he
boarded
with
her
mother
because
mary
was
always
too
busy
about
household
affairs
to
be
much
in
the
parlor
but
what
little
he
had
seen
of
her
made
him
like
her
as
a
friend
he
also
liked
turner
and
had
from
these
reasons
frequently
called
in
to
see
them
since
their
removal
after
going
into
his
room
on
his
return
home
that
evening
he
sat
down
and
remained
for
some
time
in
a
musing
attitude
at
length
he
got
up
and
took
a
few
turns
across
the
floor
and
again
seated
himself
saying
as
he
did
so
if
that
the
stuff
she
made
of
she
worth
looking
after
from
this
period
martin
called
to
see
turner
more
frequently
and
as
mary
who
had
promptly
entered
upon
the
duties
of
a
apprentice
came
home
every
evening
he
had
as
many
opportunities
of
being
with
her
and
conversing
with
her
as
he
desired
amiable
accomplished
and
intelligent
she
failed
not
to
make
unconsciously
to
herself
a
decided
impression
upon
the
young
man
heart
nor
could
she
conceal
from
herself
that
she
was
happier
in
his
company
than
she
was
at
any
other
time
week
after
week
and
month
after
month
passed
quickly
away
and
mary
was
rapidly
acquiring
a
skill
in
the
art
she
was
learning
rarely
obtained
by
any
after
the
end
of
four
months
she
could
turn
off
a
dress
equal
to
any
one
in
the
but
this
constant
application
was
making
sad
inroads
upon
her
health
for
two
years
she
had
been
engaged
in
active
and
laborious
duties
even
beyond
her
strength
the
change
from
this
condition
to
the
perfectly
sedentary
was
more
than
her
constitution
could
bear
up
under
especially
as
she
was
compelled
to
bend
over
her
needle
regularly
from
ten
to
twelve
hours
each
day
as
the
time
for
the
expiration
of
her
term
of
service
approached
she
felt
her
strength
to
be
fast
failing
her
her
cheek
had
become
paler
and
thinner
her
step
more
languid
and
her
appetite
was
almost
entirely
gone
these
indications
of
failing
health
were
not
unobserved
by
martin
but
not
having
made
up
his
mind
definitely
that
she
was
precisely
the
woman
he
wanted
for
a
wife
he
could
not
interfere
to
prevent
her
continuance
at
the
business
which
was
too
evidently
destroying
her
health
but
every
time
he
saw
her
his
interest
in
her
became
tenderer
if
no
one
steps
forward
and
saves
her
he
would
sometimes
say
to
himself
as
he
gazed
with
saddened
feelings
upon
her
colorless
cheek
she
will
fall
a
victim
in
the
very
bloom
of
womanhood
and
mary
herself
saw
the
sad
prospect
before
her
she
told
no
one
of
the
pain
in
her
side
nor
of
the
sickening
sensation
of
weakness
and
weariness
that
daily
oppressed
her
but
she
toiled
on
and
on
hoping
to
feel
better
soon
at
last
her
probation
ended
but
the
determined
and
ambitious
spirit
that
had
kept
her
up
now
gave
way
martin
knew
the
day
when
her
apprenticeship
expired
and
without
asking
why
followed
the
impulse
that
prompted
him
and
called
upon
her
in
the
evening
is
any
thing
the
matter
mrs
turner
he
asked
with
a
feeling
of
alarm
on
entering
the
house
and
catching
a
glance
at
the
expression
of
that
lady
countenance
oh
yes
martin
mary
is
extremely
ill
she
replied
in
evident
painful
anxiety
what
ails
her
he
asked
showing
equal
concern
i
do
not
know
martin
she
came
home
this
evening
and
as
soon
as
she
reached
her
chamber
fainted
away
i
sent
for
the
doctor
immediately
and
he
says
that
she
must
be
kept
very
quiet
and
that
he
will
be
here
very
early
in
the
morning
again
i
am
afraid
she
has
overworked
herself
indeed
i
am
sure
she
has
for
many
weeks
back
i
have
noticed
her
altered
appearance
and
loss
of
appetite
it
was
in
vain
that
i
urged
her
to
spare
herself
for
a
few
weeks
and
make
up
the
time
afterwards
she
steadily
urged
the
necessity
of
getting
into
business
as
soon
as
possible
and
would
not
give
up
she
has
sacrificed
herself
martin
i
very
much
fear
to
her
devotion
to
the
family
and
turner
burst
into
tears
we
need
not
say
how
sad
and
depressed
martin
was
on
turning
away
from
the
house
without
the
chance
of
seeing
mary
under
the
idea
too
of
her
dangerous
illness
he
called
about
ten
the
next
morning
and
learned
that
she
was
no
better
that
the
doctor
had
been
there
and
pronounced
her
in
a
low
nervous
fever
strict
injunctions
had
been
left
that
no
one
should
be
admitted
to
her
room
but
the
necessary
attendants
regularly
every
morning
and
evening
martin
called
to
ask
after
mary
for
the
space
of
fifteen
days
and
always
received
the
sad
information
that
she
was
no
better
his
feelings
had
now
become
intensely
excited
he
blamed
himself
for
having
favored
the
idea
of
mary
going
to
learn
a
trade
how
easily
i
might
have
prevented
it
he
said
to
himself
how
blind
i
was
to
her
true
worth
how
much
suffering
and
toil
i
might
have
saved
her
on
the
evening
of
the
sixteenth
day
he
received
the
glad
intelligence
that
mary
was
better
that
although
greatly
emaciated
and
feeble
as
an
infant
a
decidedly
healthy
action
had
taken
place
and
the
doctor
expressed
confident
hopes
of
her
recovery
may
i
not
see
her
mrs
turner
he
asked
earnestly
not
yet
martin
the
doctor
is
positive
in
his
directions
to
have
her
kept
perfectly
quiet
martin
had
of
course
to
acquiesce
but
with
great
reluctance
for
five
days
more
he
continued
to
call
in
twice
every
day
and
each
time
found
her
slightly
improved
may
i
not
see
her
now
he
again
asked
at
the
end
of
these
additional
days
of
anxious
if
you
will
not
talk
to
her
said
turner
martin
promised
and
was
shown
up
to
her
chamber
his
heart
sickened
as
he
approached
the
and
looked
upon
the
thin
white
almost
expressionless
face
and
sunken
eye
of
her
who
was
now
the
ruler
of
his
affections
he
took
her
hand
that
returned
a
feeble
almost
imperceptible
pressure
but
did
not
trust
himself
to
utter
her
name
she
hardly
seemed
conscious
of
his
presence
and
he
soon
turned
away
sad
very
sad
yet
full
of
hope
for
her
recovery
the
healthy
action
continued
and
in
a
week
mary
could
bear
conversation
as
soon
as
she
could
begin
to
sit
up
martin
passed
every
evening
with
her
and
seeing
as
he
now
did
with
different
eyes
he
perceived
in
her
a
hundred
things
to
admire
that
had
before
escaped
his
notice
recovering
rapidly
in
a
month
she
was
fully
restored
to
health
and
looked
better
than
she
had
for
years
just
about
this
time
as
martin
was
making
up
his
mind
to
declare
himself
her
lover
he
was
surprised
on
entering
their
parlor
one
evening
to
find
on
the
table
a
large
brass
with
the
words
mary
turner
fancy
dress
maker
engraved
upon
it
why
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
mary
he
asked
forgetting
that
she
did
not
know
his
peculiar
thoughts
about
her
i
am
going
to
commence
my
business
she
replied
in
a
quiet
tone
i
have
learned
a
trade
and
now
i
must
turn
it
if
possible
to
some
good
account
but
your
health
wo
bear
it
mary
he
urged
do
you
know
that
you
made
yourself
sick
by
your
close
application
in
learning
your
trade
i
do
martin
but
still
you
know
why
i
learned
my
trade
martin
paused
for
a
few
moments
and
then
looking
into
her
face
said
yes
i
know
the
reason
mary
and
i
always
admired
your
noble
independence
in
acting
as
you
did
nay
and
he
took
her
hand
if
you
will
permit
me
to
say
so
have
loved
you
ever
since
i
had
a
true
appreciation
of
your
character
may
i
hope
for
a
return
of
kindred
feelings
mary
turner
face
became
instantly
crimsoned
with
burning
blushes
but
she
did
not
withdraw
her
hand
a
brief
silence
ensued
during
which
the
only
sounds
audible
to
the
ears
of
each
was
the
beating
of
their
own
hearts
martin
at
length
said
have
i
aught
to
hope
mary
you
know
martin
she
replied
in
a
voice
that
slightly
trembled
that
i
have
duties
to
perform
beyond
myself
however
much
my
feelings
may
be
interested
these
can
not
be
set
aside
under
present
circumstances
my
hand
is
not
my
own
to
give
but
your
duties
will
become
mine
mary
and
most
gladly
will
i
assume
them
only
give
me
your
hand
and
in
return
i
will
give
you
a
home
for
all
you
love
and
you
can
do
for
them
just
as
your
heart
desires
will
you
now
be
mine
if
my
mother
object
not
she
said
bursting
into
tears
of
course
the
mother
had
no
objection
to
urge
and
in
a
few
weeks
they
were
married
it
was
perhaps
three
months
after
this
event
that
the
now
happy
family
were
seated
in
a
beautifully
furnished
parlor
large
enough
to
suit
even
turner
ideas
something
had
turned
their
thoughts
on
the
past
and
mary
alluded
to
their
sad
experience
in
keeping
boarders
you
did
not
lose
much
did
you
asked
her
husband
we
sunk
over
two
thousand
dollars
mary
replied
is
it
possible
you
paid
rather
dear
then
for
your
experience
in
keeping
a
boarding
house
so
i
then
thought
mary
answered
looking
into
his
face
with
a
smile
but
i
believe
it
was
money
well
laid
out
what
you
call
a
good
investment
how
so
mary
stooped
down
to
the
ear
of
her
husband
who
sat
a
little
behind
her
mother
and
whispered
you
are
dull
dear
i
got
you
by
it
did
i
his
young
wife
cheek
was
very
convenient
and
his
lips
touched
it
almost
involuntarily
what
is
that
mary
asked
her
mother
turning
towards
them
for
she
had
heard
her
remark
and
was
waiting
for
the
explanation
oh
nothing
mother
it
was
only
some
of
my
fun
you
seem
quite
full
of
fun
lately
said
turner
with
a
quiet
smile
of
satisfaction
and
again
bent
her
eyes
upon
the
book
she
was
reading
chapter
xxx
two
ways
with
domestics
ah
good
morning
dear
i
really
glad
to
see
you
said
helen
armitage
to
her
young
friend
fanny
milnor
as
the
latter
came
in
to
sit
an
hour
with
her
i
just
wanted
a
little
sunshine
there
ought
to
be
plenty
of
sunshine
here
returned
fanny
smiling
you
always
seem
happy
and
so
does
your
mother
and
sister
mary
whenever
i
meet
you
abroad
abroad
or
at
home
makes
quite
a
difference
fanny
precious
little
sunshine
have
we
here
not
a
day
passes
over
our
heads
that
we
are
not
thrown
into
hot
water
about
something
or
other
with
our
abominable
servants
i
declare
i
never
saw
the
like
and
it
grows
worse
and
worse
every
day
indeed
that
is
bad
sure
enough
but
ca
you
remedy
this
defect
in
some
way
we
try
hard
enough
dear
knows
i
believe
we
have
had
no
less
than
six
cooks
and
as
many
chambermaids
in
the
last
three
months
but
change
only
makes
the
matter
worse
sometimes
they
are
so
idle
and
dirty
that
we
can
not
tolerate
them
for
a
week
and
then
again
they
are
so
and
downright
saucy
that
no
one
can
venture
to
speak
to
them
as
helen
armitage
said
this
she
arose
from
her
chair
and
walking
deliberately
across
the
room
rang
the
parlor
bell
and
then
quietly
walked
back
again
and
resumed
her
seat
continuing
her
remarks
as
she
did
so
upon
the
exhaustless
theme
she
had
introduced
in
a
little
while
a
domestic
entered
that
door
has
been
left
open
by
some
one
the
young
lady
said
in
a
half
vexed
tone
of
authority
and
with
a
glance
of
reproof
as
she
pointed
to
the
door
of
the
back
parlor
leading
into
the
passage
the
servant
turned
quickly
away
muttering
as
she
did
so
and
left
the
parlor
slamming
the
door
after
her
with
a
sudden
indignant
jerk
you
see
that
remarked
helen
the
color
deepening
on
her
cheeks
and
her
voice
indicating
a
good
deal
of
inward
disturbance
just
the
way
we
are
served
by
nine
out
of
ten
of
the
people
we
get
about
us
they
neglect
every
thing
and
then
when
reminded
of
their
duty
flirt
and
grumble
and
fling
about
just
as
you
saw
that
girl
do
this
moment
i
ring
for
her
again
and
make
her
shut
that
door
as
she
ought
to
do
the
insolent
creature
helen
was
rising
when
fanny
laid
her
hand
on
her
arm
and
said
in
a
quiet
persuasive
tone
no
no
do
helen
she
is
out
of
temper
and
will
only
retort
angrily
at
further
reproof
the
better
way
is
to
pass
over
these
things
as
if
you
did
not
notice
them
and
let
them
ride
over
us
rough
shod
as
they
most
certainly
will
the
fact
is
with
all
our
efforts
to
make
them
know
and
keep
their
places
we
find
it
impossible
to
gain
any
true
subordination
in
the
house
we
never
have
any
trouble
of
this
kind
fanny
said
you
must
be
very
fortunate
then
i
do
know
as
to
that
i
never
recollect
an
instance
in
which
a
domestic
opposed
my
mother
or
failed
to
obey
cheerfully
any
request
and
we
have
had
several
in
our
house
within
my
recollection
at
least
half
a
dozen
half
a
dozen
oh
dear
we
have
half
a
dozen
a
month
sometimes
but
come
let
us
go
up
to
my
room
i
have
some
new
prints
to
show
you
they
are
exquisite
my
father
bought
them
for
me
last
week
the
two
young
ladies
ascended
to
helen
chamber
in
the
third
story
but
the
book
of
prints
was
not
to
be
found
there
it
is
in
the
parlor
i
recollect
now
said
helen
ringing
the
bell
as
she
spoke
with
a
quick
strong
jerk
in
about
three
or
four
minutes
and
just
as
the
young
patience
was
exhausted
and
her
fingers
were
beginning
to
itch
for
another
pull
at
the
bell
rope
the
tardy
waiting
women
appeared
hannah
go
down
into
the
parlor
and
bring
me
off
of
the
piano
a
book
you
will
find
there
it
is
a
broad
flat
book
with
loose
sheets
in
it
this
was
said
in
a
tone
of
authority
the
domestic
turned
away
without
speaking
and
went
down
stairs
in
a
little
while
she
came
back
and
handed
helen
a
book
answering
the
description
given
but
it
was
a
portfolio
of
music
o
no
not
this
said
she
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
and
an
impatient
tossing
of
her
head
how
stupid
you
are
hannah
the
book
i
want
contains
prints
and
this
is
only
a
music
book
there
take
it
back
and
bring
me
the
book
of
prints
hannah
took
the
book
and
muttering
as
she
went
out
returned
to
the
parlor
down
two
long
flights
of
stairs
and
laid
it
upon
the
piano
if
you
want
the
pictures
you
may
get
them
yourself
miss
got
more
time
to
run
up
and
down
stairs
than
i
have
as
she
said
this
hannah
left
the
parlor
and
the
book
of
prints
lying
upon
the
piano
and
went
back
to
the
chamber
she
had
been
engaged
in
cleaning
up
when
called
away
by
helen
bell
it
was
not
long
after
she
had
resumed
her
occupation
before
the
bell
sounded
loudly
through
the
passages
hannah
smiled
bitterly
and
with
an
air
of
resolution
as
she
listened
to
the
iron
summons
pull
away
to
your
heart
content
miss
she
said
half
audibly
when
you
call
me
again
take
care
and
know
what
you
want
me
for
i
got
something
else
to
do
besides
running
up
and
down
stairs
to
bring
you
pictures
why
did
you
look
at
them
while
you
were
in
the
parlor
or
take
them
up
with
you
if
you
wanted
them
in
your
chamber
did
you
ever
see
the
like
ejaculated
helen
deeply
disturbed
at
finding
both
her
direction
and
her
subsequent
summons
unattended
to
that
just
the
way
we
are
constantly
served
by
these
abominable
creatures
two
or
three
heavy
jerks
at
the
bell
rope
followed
these
remarks
pull
away
it
good
exercise
for
you
muttered
hannah
to
herself
and
this
was
all
the
notice
she
took
of
the
incensed
young
lady
who
was
finally
compelled
to
go
down
stairs
and
get
the
prints
herself
but
she
was
so
much
disturbed
and
caused
fanny
to
feel
so
unpleasantly
that
neither
of
them
had
any
real
enjoyment
in
examining
the
beautiful
pictures
after
these
had
been
turned
over
and
remarked
upon
for
some
time
and
they
had
spent
an
hour
in
conversation
the
bell
was
again
rung
hannah
who
came
with
her
usual
reluctance
was
directed
to
prepare
some
lemonade
and
bring
it
up
with
cake
this
she
did
after
a
good
deal
of
delay
for
which
she
was
grumbled
at
by
helen
after
the
cake
bad
been
eaten
and
the
lemonade
drank
hannah
was
again
summoned
to
remove
the
waiter
this
was
performed
with
the
same
ill
grace
that
every
other
service
had
been
rendered
i
declare
these
servants
worry
me
almost
to
death
helen
again
broke
forth
this
is
just
the
way
i
am
served
whenever
i
have
a
visiter
it
is
always
the
time
hannah
takes
to
be
and
show
off
her
disobliging
ugly
temper
fanny
made
no
reply
to
this
but
she
had
her
own
thoughts
it
was
plain
enough
to
her
mind
that
her
friend
had
only
herself
to
blame
for
the
annoyance
she
suffered
after
witnessing
one
or
two
mote
petty
contentions
with
the
domestic
fanny
went
away
her
friend
promising
at
her
particular
request
to
come
and
spend
a
day
with
her
early
in
the
ensuing
week
it
can
do
no
harm
and
may
do
good
for
us
to
draw
aside
for
an
instant
the
veil
that
screened
from
general
observation
the
domestic
economy
of
the
armitage
family
they
were
well
enough
off
in
the
world
as
regards
wealth
but
rather
poorly
off
in
respect
to
and
that
domestic
wisdom
which
arranges
all
parts
of
a
household
in
just
subordination
and
thus
prevents
collisions
or
encroachments
of
one
portion
upon
another
with
them
a
servant
was
looked
upon
as
a
machine
who
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
obey
all
commands
as
to
the
rights
of
servants
in
a
household
that
was
something
of
which
they
had
never
dreamed
of
course
constant
rebellion
or
the
most
unwillingly
preformed
duties
was
the
undeviating
attendant
upon
their
domestic
economy
it
was
a
maxim
with
armitage
never
to
indulge
or
favor
one
of
her
people
in
the
smallest
matter
she
had
never
done
so
in
her
life
she
said
that
she
had
got
any
thanks
for
it
it
always
made
them
presumptuous
and
dissatisfied
the
more
you
did
for
them
the
more
they
expected
and
soon
came
to
demand
as
a
right
what
had
been
at
first
granted
as
a
favor
armitage
was
in
a
word
one
of
those
petty
domestic
tyrants
who
rule
with
the
rod
of
apparent
authority
perfect
submission
she
deemed
the
only
true
order
in
a
household
of
course
true
order
she
never
could
gain
for
such
a
thing
as
perfect
submission
to
arbitrary
rule
among
domestics
in
this
country
never
has
and
never
will
be
yielded
the
law
of
kindness
and
consideration
is
the
only
true
law
and
where
this
is
not
efficient
none
other
will
or
can
be
as
for
armitage
and
her
daughters
each
one
of
whom
bore
herself
towards
the
domestics
with
an
air
of
imperiousness
and
dictation
they
never
reflected
before
requiring
a
service
whether
such
a
service
would
not
be
felt
as
burdensome
in
the
extreme
and
therefore
whether
it
might
not
be
dispensed
with
at
the
time
without
regard
to
what
might
be
going
on
in
the
kitchen
the
parlor
or
chamber
bells
were
rung
and
servants
required
to
leave
their
half
finished
meals
or
to
break
away
in
the
midst
of
important
duties
that
had
to
be
done
by
a
certain
time
to
attend
to
some
trifling
matter
which
in
fact
should
never
have
been
assigned
to
a
domestic
at
all
under
this
system
it
was
no
wonder
that
a
constant
succession
of
complaints
against
servants
should
be
made
by
the
armitages
how
could
it
be
otherwise
flesh
and
blood
could
not
patiently
bear
the
trials
to
which
these
people
were
subjected
nor
was
it
any
wonder
that
frequent
changes
took
place
or
that
they
were
only
able
to
retain
the
most
inferior
class
of
servants
and
then
only
for
short
periods
there
are
few
perhaps
who
can
not
refer
among
their
acquaintances
to
a
family
like
the
armitages
they
may
ordinarily
be
known
by
their
constant
complaints
about
servants
and
their
dictatorial
way
of
speaking
whenever
they
happen
to
call
upon
them
for
the
performance
of
any
duty
in
pleasing
contrast
to
them
were
the
milnors
let
us
go
with
helen
in
her
visit
to
fanny
when
the
day
came
which
she
had
promised
to
spend
with
her
young
friend
helen
after
getting
out
of
patience
with
the
chambermaid
for
her
tardy
attendance
upon
her
and
indulging
her
daily
murmurs
against
servants
at
last
emerged
into
the
street
and
took
her
way
towards
the
dwelling
of
milnor
it
was
a
bright
day
and
her
spirits
soon
rose
superior
to
the
little
annoyances
that
had
fretted
her
for
the
past
hour
when
she
met
fanny
she
was
in
the
best
possible
humor
and
so
seemed
the
tidy
domestic
who
had
admitted
her
for
she
looked
very
cheerful
and
smiled
as
she
opened
the
door
how
different
from
our
grumbling
slovenly
set
helen
could
not
help
remarking
to
herself
as
she
passed
in
fanny
welcomed
her
with
genuine
cordiality
and
the
two
young
ladies
were
soon
engaged
in
pleasant
conversation
after
exhausting
various
themes
they
turned
to
music
and
played
and
sang
together
for
half
an
hour
i
believe
i
have
some
new
prints
that
you
have
never
seen
said
fanny
on
their
leaving
the
piano
and
she
looked
around
for
the
portfolio
of
engravings
but
could
not
find
it
oh
now
i
remember
it
is
up
stairs
excuse
me
for
a
minute
and
i
will
run
and
get
it
as
fanny
said
this
she
glided
from
the
room
in
a
few
minutes
she
returned
with
the
book
of
prints
pardon
me
fanny
but
why
did
you
call
a
servant
to
get
the
for
you
you
have
them
in
the
house
to
wait
upon
you
oh
as
to
that
returned
fanny
i
always
prefer
to
wait
upon
myself
when
i
can
and
so
remain
independent
and
besides
the
girls
are
all
busy
ironing
and
i
would
not
call
them
off
from
their
work
for
any
thing
that
i
could
do
myself
ironing
day
is
a
pretty
hard
day
for
all
of
them
for
our
family
is
large
and
mother
always
likes
her
work
done
well
but
if
you
adopt
that
system
you
soon
have
them
grumbling
at
the
merest
trifle
you
may
be
compelled
to
ask
them
to
do
so
far
from
that
helen
i
never
make
a
request
of
any
domestic
in
the
house
that
is
not
instantly
and
cheerfully
met
to
make
you
sensible
of
the
good
effects
of
the
system
i
pursue
of
not
asking
to
be
waited
on
when
i
can
help
myself
i
will
mention
that
as
i
came
down
just
now
with
these
engravings
in
my
hand
i
met
our
chambermaid
on
the
stairs
with
a
basket
of
clothes
in
her
hands
now
miss
fanny
she
said
half
reprovingly
did
you
call
me
to
get
that
for
you
and
not
leave
your
company
in
the
parlor
there
is
no
reluctance
about
her
you
see
she
knows
that
i
spare
her
whenever
i
can
and
she
is
willing
to
oblige
me
whenever
she
can
do
so
truly
she
must
be
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
said
helen
in
laughing
surprise
who
ever
heard
of
a
servant
that
asked
as
a
favor
to
be
permitted
to
serve
you
all
of
which
i
ever
saw
or
heard
cared
only
to
get
out
of
doing
every
thing
and
strove
to
be
as
disobliging
as
possible
it
is
related
of
the
good
oberlin
replied
fanny
that
he
was
asked
one
day
by
an
old
female
servant
who
had
been
in
his
house
for
many
years
whether
there
were
servants
in
heaven
on
his
inquiring
the
reason
for
so
singular
a
question
he
received
in
substance
this
reply
will
be
no
heaven
to
me
unless
i
have
the
privilege
of
ministering
to
your
wants
and
comfort
there
as
i
have
the
privilege
of
doing
here
i
want
to
be
your
servant
even
in
heaven
now
why
helen
do
you
suppose
that
faithful
old
servant
was
so
strongly
attached
to
oberlin
because
i
presume
he
had
been
uniformly
kind
to
her
no
doubt
that
was
the
principal
reason
and
that
i
presume
is
the
reason
why
there
is
no
domestic
in
our
house
who
will
not
at
any
time
do
for
me
cheerfully
and
with
a
seeming
pleasure
any
thing
i
ask
of
her
i
am
sure
i
never
spoke
cross
to
one
of
them
in
my
life
and
i
make
it
a
point
never
to
ask
them
to
do
for
me
what
i
can
readily
do
for
myself
your
mother
must
be
very
fortunate
in
her
selection
of
servants
there
i
presume
lies
the
secret
we
never
had
one
who
would
bear
the
least
consideration
indeed
ma
makes
it
a
rule
on
no
account
to
grant
a
servant
any
indulgences
whatever
it
only
spoils
them
she
says
you
must
keep
them
right
down
to
it
or
they
soon
get
good
for
nothing
my
mother
system
is
very
different
fanny
said
and
we
have
no
trouble
the
young
ladies
then
commenced
examining
the
prints
after
which
fanny
asked
to
be
excused
a
moment
in
a
little
while
she
returned
with
a
small
waiter
of
refreshments
helen
did
not
remark
upon
this
and
fanny
made
no
allusion
to
the
fact
of
not
having
called
a
servant
from
the
kitchen
to
do
what
she
could
so
easily
do
herself
a
book
next
engaged
their
attention
and
occupied
them
until
dinner
time
at
the
stable
a
tidy
domestic
waited
with
cheerful
alacrity
so
different
from
the
sulky
slow
attendance
at
home
some
water
rachael
if
you
please
or
rachael
step
down
and
bring
up
some
hot
potatoes
or
here
rachael
with
a
pleasant
smile
you
have
forgotten
the
salt
spoons
were
forms
of
addressing
a
waiter
upon
the
table
so
different
from
what
helen
had
ever
heard
that
she
listened
to
them
with
utter
amazement
and
she
was
no
less
surprised
to
see
with
what
cheerful
alacrity
every
direction
or
rather
request
was
obeyed
after
they
all
rose
from
the
table
and
had
retired
to
the
parlor
a
pleasant
conversation
took
place
in
which
no
allusions
whatever
were
made
to
the
dreadful
annoyance
of
servants
an
almost
unvarying
subject
of
discourse
at
armitage
after
the
conclusion
of
nearly
every
badly
cooked
illy
served
a
discourse
too
often
overheard
by
some
one
of
the
domestics
and
retailed
in
the
kitchen
to
breed
confirmed
and
a
spirit
of
opposition
towards
the
principal
members
of
the
family
nearly
half
an
hour
had
passed
from
the
time
they
had
risen
from
the
table
when
a
younger
sister
of
fanny
who
was
going
out
to
a
little
afternoon
party
asked
if
rachael
might
not
be
called
up
from
the
kitchen
to
get
something
for
her
no
my
dear
not
until
she
has
finished
her
dinner
was
the
mild
reply
of
milnor
but
it
wo
take
her
over
a
minute
mother
and
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
ca
help
it
my
dear
you
will
have
to
wait
rachael
must
not
be
disturbed
at
her
meals
you
should
have
thought
of
this
before
dinner
you
know
i
have
always
tried
to
impress
upon
your
mind
that
there
are
certain
hours
in
which
domestics
must
not
be
called
upon
to
do
any
thing
unless
of
serious
importance
they
have
their
rights
as
well
as
we
have
and
it
is
just
as
wrong
for
us
to
encroach
upon
their
rights
as
it
is
for
them
to
encroach
upon
ours
never
mind
mother
i
will
wait
the
little
girl
said
cheerfully
but
i
thought
it
was
such
a
trifle
and
would
have
taken
her
only
a
minute
it
is
true
my
dear
that
is
but
a
trifle
still
even
trifles
of
this
kind
we
should
form
the
habit
of
avoiding
for
they
may
seriously
annoy
at
a
time
when
we
dream
not
that
they
are
thought
of
for
a
moment
think
how
just
as
you
had
seated
yourself
at
the
table
tired
and
hungry
you
would
like
to
be
called
away
your
food
scarcely
tasted
to
perform
some
task
the
urgency
of
which
to
you
at
least
was
very
questionable
i
was
wrong
i
know
mother
the
child
replied
and
you
are
right
all
this
was
new
and
strange
doctrine
to
helen
armitage
but
she
was
enabled
to
see
from
the
manner
in
which
milnor
represented
the
subject
that
it
was
true
doctrine
as
this
became
clear
to
her
mind
she
saw
with
painful
distinctness
the
error
that
had
thrown
disorder
into
every
part
of
her
mother
household
and
more
than
this
she
inwardly
resolved
that
so
far
as
her
action
was
concerned
a
new
order
of
things
should
take
place
in
this
she
was
in
earnest
so
much
so
that
she
made
some
allusion
to
the
difference
of
things
at
home
to
what
they
were
at
milnor
and
frankly
confessed
that
she
had
not
acted
upon
the
kind
and
considerate
principles
that
seemed
to
govern
all
in
this
family
my
dear
child
milnor
said
to
her
with
affectionate
earnestness
in
reply
to
this
allusion
depend
upon
it
of
the
bad
domestics
are
made
so
by
injudicious
treatment
they
are
for
the
most
part
ignorant
of
almost
every
thing
and
too
often
particularly
of
their
duties
in
a
family
instead
of
being
borne
with
instructed
and
treated
with
consideration
they
are
scolded
driven
and
found
fault
with
kind
words
they
too
rarely
receive
and
no
one
can
well
and
cheerfully
perform
all
that
is
required
of
her
as
a
domestic
if
she
is
never
spoken
to
kindly
never
considered
never
borne
with
patiently
it
is
in
our
power
to
make
a
great
deal
of
work
for
our
servants
that
is
altogether
unnecessary
and
of
course
in
our
power
to
save
them
many
steps
and
many
moments
of
time
if
we
are
in
the
chambers
and
wish
a
servant
for
any
thing
and
she
is
down
in
the
kitchen
engaged
it
is
always
well
to
think
twice
before
we
ring
for
her
once
it
may
be
that
we
do
not
really
want
the
attendance
of
any
one
or
can
just
as
well
wait
until
some
errand
has
brought
her
up
stairs
then
there
are
various
little
things
in
which
we
can
help
ourselves
and
ought
to
do
it
it
is
unpardonable
i
think
for
a
lady
to
ring
for
a
servant
to
come
up
one
or
two
pairs
of
stairs
merely
to
hand
her
a
drink
when
all
she
has
to
do
is
to
cross
the
room
and
get
it
for
herself
or
for
a
young
lady
to
require
a
servant
to
attend
to
all
her
little
wants
when
she
can
and
ought
to
help
herself
even
if
it
takes
her
from
the
third
story
to
the
kitchen
half
a
dozen
times
a
day
above
all
domestics
should
never
be
scolded
if
reproof
is
necessary
let
it
be
administered
in
a
calm
mild
voice
and
the
reasons
shown
why
the
act
complained
of
is
wrong
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
any
good
is
done
i
wish
my
mother
could
only
learn
that
said
helen
mentally
as
milnor
ceased
speaking
when
she
returned
home
it
was
with
a
deeply
formed
resolution
never
again
to
speak
reprovingly
to
any
of
her
mother
domestics
never
to
order
them
to
do
any
thing
for
her
and
never
to
require
them
to
wait
upon
her
when
she
could
just
as
well
help
herself
in
this
she
proved
firm
the
consequence
was
an
entire
change
in
hannah
deportment
towards
her
and
a
cheerful
performance
by
her
of
every
thing
she
asked
her
to
do
this
could
not
but
be
observed
by
her
mother
and
it
induced
her
to
modify
to
some
extent
her
way
of
treating
her
servants
the
result
was
salutary
and
now
she
has
far
less
trouble
with
them
than
she
ever
had
in
her
life
all
she
finds
are
not
so
worthless
as
she
had
deemed
them
chapter
xxxi
a
mother
duty
i
close
my
volume
of
rambling
sketches
with
a
chapter
more
didactic
and
serious
the
duties
of
the
housekeeper
and
mother
usually
unite
in
the
same
person
but
difficult
and
perplexing
as
is
the
former
relation
how
light
and
easy
are
all
its
claims
compared
with
those
of
the
latter
among
my
readers
are
many
mothers
let
us
for
a
little
while
hold
counsel
together
to
the
mind
of
a
mother
who
loves
her
children
no
subject
can
have
so
deep
an
interest
as
that
which
has
respect
to
the
well
being
of
her
offspring
young
mothers
especially
feel
the
need
the
great
need
of
the
hints
and
helps
to
be
derived
from
others
experience
to
them
the
duty
of
rightly
guiding
forming
and
developing
the
young
mind
is
altogether
a
new
one
at
every
step
they
feel
their
incompetence
and
are
troubled
at
their
want
of
success
a
young
married
friend
the
mother
of
two
active
little
boys
said
to
me
one
day
earnestly
oh
i
think
sometimes
that
i
would
give
the
world
if
i
only
could
see
clearly
what
was
my
duty
towards
my
children
i
try
to
guide
them
aright
i
try
to
keep
them
from
all
improper
influences
but
rank
weeds
continually
spring
up
with
the
flowers
i
have
planted
how
shall
i
extirpate
these
without
injuring
the
others
how
many
a
young
mother
thus
thinks
and
feels
it
is
indeed
a
great
responsibility
that
rests
upon
her
with
the
most
constant
and
careful
attention
she
will
find
the
task
of
keeping
out
the
weeds
a
hard
one
but
let
her
not
become
weary
or
discouraged
the
enemy
is
ever
seeking
to
sow
tares
amid
her
wheat
and
he
will
do
it
if
she
sleep
at
her
post
constant
care
good
precept
and
above
all
good
example
will
do
much
the
gardener
whose
eye
is
ever
over
and
whose
hand
is
ever
busy
in
his
garden
accomplishes
much
the
measure
of
his
success
may
be
seen
if
the
eye
rest
for
but
a
moment
on
the
garden
of
his
neighbor
the
sluggard
even
if
a
weed
springs
here
and
there
it
is
quickly
plucked
up
and
never
suffered
to
obstruct
or
weaken
the
growth
of
esculent
plants
a
mole
may
enter
stealthily
marring
the
beauty
of
a
and
disturbing
the
roots
of
some
but
through
the
careful
well
set
enclosure
no
beasts
find
an
entrance
so
it
will
be
with
the
watchful
conscientious
mother
she
will
so
fence
around
her
children
from
external
dangers
and
allurements
that
destructive
beasts
will
be
kept
out
and
she
will
at
the
same
time
cultivate
the
garden
of
their
good
affections
and
extirpate
the
weeds
that
her
children
may
grow
up
in
moral
health
and
beauty
all
this
can
be
done
but
the
right
path
must
be
seen
before
we
can
walk
in
it
every
mother
feels
as
the
one
i
have
alluded
to
but
some
while
they
feel
as
deeply
have
not
the
clear
perceptions
of
what
is
right
that
others
have
much
has
been
written
on
the
subject
of
guiding
and
governing
children
much
that
is
good
and
much
that
is
of
doubtful
utility
i
will
here
present
from
the
pen
of
an
english
lady
whose
work
has
not
we
believe
been
in
this
country
a
most
excellent
series
of
precepts
they
deserve
to
be
written
in
letters
of
gold
and
hung
up
in
every
nursery
she
says
the
moment
a
child
is
born
into
the
world
a
mother
duties
commence
and
of
all
those
which
god
has
allotted
to
mortals
there
are
none
so
important
as
those
which
devolve
upon
a
mother
more
feeble
and
helpless
than
any
thing
else
of
living
creatures
is
an
infant
in
the
first
days
of
its
existence
unable
to
minister
to
its
own
wants
unable
even
to
make
those
wants
known
a
feeble
cry
which
indicates
suffering
but
not
what
or
where
the
pain
is
is
all
it
can
utter
but
to
meet
this
weakness
and
incapacity
on
the
part
of
the
infant
god
has
implanted
in
the
heart
of
the
mother
a
yearning
affection
to
her
offspring
so
that
she
feels
this
almost
inanimate
being
to
be
a
part
of
herself
and
every
cry
of
pain
acts
as
a
dagger
to
her
own
heart
and
to
humanity
alone
of
all
the
tribes
of
animated
beings
has
a
power
been
given
to
nullify
this
feeling
beast
bird
and
insect
attend
to
the
wants
of
their
offspring
accordingly
as
those
wants
require
much
or
little
assiduity
but
woman
if
she
will
can
drug
and
stupefy
this
feeling
she
can
commit
the
charge
of
her
child
to
dependants
and
servants
and
need
only
to
take
care
that
enough
is
provided
to
meet
that
child
wants
but
need
not
see
herself
that
those
wants
are
actually
met
but
a
woman
who
does
this
is
far
very
far
from
doing
her
duty
who
is
so
fit
to
watch
over
the
wants
of
infancy
as
she
who
gave
that
infant
birth
can
a
mother
suppose
that
if
she
can
so
stifle
those
sensibilities
which
prompt
her
to
provide
for
the
wants
of
her
children
servants
and
dependants
in
whom
no
such
sensibilities
exist
will
be
very
solicitous
about
their
charge
how
many
of
the
infant
cries
will
be
unattended
to
which
would
at
once
have
made
their
way
to
the
heart
of
a
mother
and
therefore
how
many
of
the
child
wants
will
in
consequence
remain
uncared
for
no
one
can
understand
so
well
the
wants
of
a
child
as
a
mother
no
one
is
ever
so
ready
to
meet
those
wants
as
she
and
therefore
to
none
but
a
mother
under
ordinary
circumstances
should
the
entire
charge
of
a
child
be
committed
and
in
all
countries
in
which
luxury
has
not
so
far
attained
the
ascendency
that
in
order
to
partake
of
its
pleasures
a
mother
will
desert
her
offspring
the
cares
and
trials
of
maternal
love
are
entered
upon
as
the
sweetest
of
enjoyments
and
the
greatest
of
pleasures
it
was
a
noble
saying
of
a
queen
of
france
that
none
should
share
with
her
the
privileges
of
a
mother
and
if
the
same
sentiment
found
its
way
into
every
heart
a
very
different
aspect
would
soon
be
produced
how
many
through
and
neglect
in
childhood
carry
the
marks
to
their
dying
day
in
weak
and
sickly
constitutions
how
many
more
in
a
distorted
body
and
crippled
limbs
these
are
but
the
too
sure
consequences
of
the
neglect
of
a
mother
and
consequent
upon
that
the
neglect
of
servants
who
feeling
the
child
a
burden
lessen
their
own
trouble
and
many
a
mother
who
perhaps
now
that
her
child
has
grown
up
weeps
bitter
tears
over
his
infirmities
might
have
saved
his
pain
and
her
own
sorrow
by
attending
to
his
wants
in
infancy
can
a
mother
forget
her
sucking
child
asks
the
inspired
penman
in
a
way
that
it
would
seem
to
be
so
great
an
anomaly
as
almost
to
amount
to
an
impossibility
yet
modern
luxury
not
only
proves
that
such
a
thing
can
be
done
but
it
is
one
even
of
common
occurrence
but
if
done
surely
some
great
stake
must
be
pending
something
on
which
life
and
property
are
concerned
that
a
mother
can
thus
forget
the
child
of
her
bosom
alas
no
the
child
is
neglected
that
no
interruption
may
take
place
in
the
mother
stream
of
pleasure
for
the
blandishments
of
the
theatre
or
the
excitements
of
the
dance
is
a
child
left
to
the
charge
of
those
who
have
nothing
of
love
for
it
no
sympathy
for
its
sufferings
no
joyousness
in
sharing
in
its
pleasures
a
woman
forfeits
all
claim
to
the
sacred
character
of
a
mother
if
she
abandon
her
offspring
to
the
entire
care
of
others
for
ere
she
can
do
this
she
must
have
stifled
all
the
best
feelings
of
her
nature
and
become
worse
than
the
infidel
for
she
gives
freely
to
the
stranger
and
neglects
her
own
therefore
should
a
woman
if
she
would
fulfil
her
duty
make
her
child
her
first
care
it
is
not
necessary
that
her
whole
time
should
be
spent
in
attending
to
its
wants
but
it
is
necessary
that
so
much
of
the
time
should
be
spent
that
nothing
should
be
neglected
which
could
add
to
the
child
comfort
and
happiness
and
not
only
is
it
needful
that
a
woman
should
show
a
motherly
fondness
for
her
child
so
that
she
should
attend
to
its
wants
and
be
solicitous
for
its
welfare
it
is
also
necessary
that
she
should
know
how
those
wants
are
best
to
be
provided
for
and
how
that
welfare
is
best
to
be
consulted
for
to
the
natural
feelings
which
prompt
animals
to
provide
for
their
offspring
to
humanity
is
added
the
noble
gift
of
reason
so
that
thought
and
solicitude
are
not
merely
the
effects
of
blind
instinct
but
the
produce
of
a
higher
and
nobler
faculty
as
we
have
already
adverted
to
this
point
we
shall
only
say
that
without
a
knowledge
of
how
the
physical
wants
of
a
child
are
to
be
met
in
the
best
manner
a
mother
can
not
be
said
to
be
performing
her
duty
for
the
kindness
which
is
bestowed
may
be
but
the
result
of
natural
feeling
which
it
would
be
far
harder
to
resist
than
to
fulfil
whereas
the
want
of
knowledge
may
have
resulted
from
ignorance
and
idleness
and
the
loss
of
this
knowledge
will
never
be
made
up
by
natural
kindness
and
love
it
will
be
like
trying
to
work
without
hands
or
to
see
when
the
eyes
are
blinded
but
there
is
yet
a
higher
duty
devolving
upon
woman
she
has
to
attend
to
the
mental
and
moral
wants
of
her
offspring
as
well
as
to
the
physical
and
helpless
as
we
are
born
into
the
world
if
reference
be
made
to
our
physical
wants
we
are
yet
more
helpless
if
reference
be
made
to
our
mental
and
moral
we
come
into
the
world
with
evil
passions
perverted
faculties
and
unholy
dispositions
for
let
what
will
be
said
of
the
blandness
and
attractiveness
of
children
there
are
in
those
young
hearts
the
seeds
of
evil
and
it
needs
but
that
a
note
be
taken
of
what
passes
in
the
life
of
a
child
to
convince
that
all
is
not
so
amiable
as
at
first
sight
appears
but
that
the
heart
hides
dark
deformity
headstrong
passions
and
vicious
thoughts
and
to
a
mother
lot
it
falls
to
be
the
instructress
of
her
children
their
guide
and
pattern
and
she
fails
in
her
duty
when
she
fails
in
either
of
these
points
but
it
may
be
said
that
the
requirement
is
greater
than
humanity
can
perform
and
that
it
would
need
angelic
purity
to
be
able
fully
to
meet
it
for
who
shall
say
that
she
is
so
perfect
that
no
inconsistencies
shall
appear
between
what
she
teaches
and
what
she
practises
it
would
be
indeed
to
suppose
mothers
more
than
human
to
think
that
their
instructions
should
be
perfect
the
best
of
mothers
are
liable
to
err
and
the
love
a
mother
has
for
her
child
may
tempt
her
frequently
to
pass
over
faults
which
she
knows
ought
to
be
corrected
but
making
due
allowance
for
human
incompetency
and
human
weakness
still
will
a
mother
be
bound
to
the
utmost
of
her
power
to
be
the
instructress
of
her
child
equally
by
the
lesson
she
inculcates
and
the
pattern
she
exhibits
there
is
indeed
too
much
neglect
shown
in
the
instruction
of
children
mothers
seem
to
think
that
if
amiable
qualities
are
shown
in
the
exterior
no
instruction
is
necessary
for
the
heart
but
this
is
a
most
futile
attempt
to
make
children
virtuous
it
is
like
attempting
to
purify
water
down
the
stream
and
leaving
it
still
foul
at
the
source
the
heart
should
be
the
first
thing
instructed
a
motive
and
a
reason
should
be
given
for
every
requirement
a
motive
and
a
reason
should
be
given
for
every
abstinence
called
for
and
when
the
heart
is
made
to
love
virtue
the
actions
will
be
those
of
virtue
for
it
is
the
heart
which
is
the
great
mover
of
all
actions
and
the
moment
a
child
can
distinguish
between
a
smile
and
a
frown
from
that
moment
should
instruction
commence
an
instruction
suited
indeed
to
infantine
capacities
but
which
should
be
enlarged
as
the
child
capacities
expand
it
is
very
bad
policy
to
suffer
the
first
years
of
a
life
to
pass
without
instruction
for
if
good
be
not
written
on
the
mind
there
is
sure
to
be
evil
it
is
a
mother
duty
to
watch
the
expanding
intellect
of
her
child
and
to
suit
her
instructions
accordingly
it
is
equally
so
to
learn
its
disposition
to
study
its
wishes
its
hopes
and
its
fears
and
to
direct
control
and
point
them
to
noble
aims
and
ends
oh
not
alone
is
it
needful
that
a
mother
be
solicitous
for
the
health
and
happiness
of
her
child
on
earth
a
far
higher
and
more
important
thought
should
engage
her
attention
concern
for
her
child
as
an
immortal
and
an
accountable
being
to
all
who
bear
the
endearing
name
of
mother
thus
would
we
speak
that
child
with
whom
you
are
so
fondly
playing
whose
happy
and
smiling
countenance
might
serve
for
the
representation
of
a
cherub
and
whose
merry
laugh
rings
joyously
and
free
yes
that
blooming
child
notwithstanding
all
these
pleasing
and
attractive
smiles
has
a
heart
prone
to
evil
to
you
is
it
committed
to
be
the
teacher
of
that
child
and
on
that
teaching
will
mainly
if
not
entirely
depend
its
future
happiness
or
misery
not
of
a
few
brief
years
not
of
a
but
of
eternity
for
though
a
dying
creature
it
is
still
immortal
and
the
happiness
or
misery
of
that
immortality
depends
upon
your
instruction
will
you
neglect
or
refuse
to
be
your
child
teacher
shall
the
world
and
its
pleasures
draw
off
your
attention
from
your
duty
when
so
much
is
at
stake
or
will
you
leave
your
child
to
glean
knowledge
as
best
it
can
thus
imbibing
all
principles
and
all
habits
most
of
them
unwholesome
and
many
poisonous
you
can
decide
you
the
mother
you
gave
it
life
you
may
make
that
life
a
blessing
or
a
curse
as
you
inculcate
good
or
evil
for
if
through
your
neglect
or
through
bad
example
you
let
evil
passions
obtain
an
ascendency
that
child
may
grow
into
a
dissolute
and
immoral
man
his
career
may
be
one
of
debauchery
and
profaneness
and
then
when
he
comes
to
die
in
the
agonies
of
remorse
in
the
delirium
of
a
spirit
he
may
gasp
out
his
last
breath
with
a
curse
on
your
head
for
having
given
him
life
but
not
a
disposition
to
use
it
aright
so
that
his
has
been
a
life
of
shame
and
disgrace
here
and
will
be
one
of
misery
hereafter
that
character
is
yet
untainted
with
you
that
decision
rests
his
destiny
is
in
your
hands
he
may
have
dispositions
the
most
dark
and
foul
falseness
hatred
and
revenge
but
you
may
prevent
their
growth
he
may
have
dispositions
the
most
bland
and
attractive
you
can
so
order
it
that
contact
with
the
world
shall
never
sully
them
yes
you
the
mother
can
prevent
the
evil
and
nurture
the
good
you
can
teach
that
child
you
can
rear
it
discipline
it
you
can
make
your
offspring
so
love
you
that
the
memory
of
your
piety
shall
prevent
their
wickedness
and
the
hallowed
recollection
of
your
goodness
stimulate
their
own
and
equally
in
your
power
is
it
to
neglect
your
child
by
suffering
pleasure
to
lure
you
by
following
the
follies
of
fashion
or
by
the
charm
of
those
baubles
which
the
world
presents
to
the
eye
but
keeps
from
your
grasp
you
may
neglect
your
child
but
you
have
neglected
a
plain
and
positive
duty
a
duty
which
is
engraven
on
your
heart
and
wound
into
your
nature
and
a
duty
neglected
is
sure
sooner
or
later
to
come
back
again
as
an
avenger
to
punish
while
on
the
other
hand
a
duty
performed
to
the
best
of
the
ability
returns
back
to
the
performer
laden
with
a
blessing
but
it
may
be
said
how
are
children
to
be
trained
in
order
that
happiness
may
be
the
result
it
is
quite
impossible
to
lay
down
rules
for
the
management
of
children
since
those
which
would
serve
for
guidance
in
regulating
the
conduct
of
one
child
would
work
the
worst
results
when
applied
to
another
but
we
mention
a
few
particulars
the
grand
secret
in
the
management
of
children
is
to
treat
them
as
reasonable
beings
we
see
that
they
are
governed
by
hope
fear
and
love
these
feelings
then
should
be
made
the
instruments
by
which
their
education
is
conducted
whenever
it
is
possible
and
it
is
very
rarely
that
it
is
not
a
reason
should
be
given
for
every
requirement
and
a
motive
for
the
undertaking
any
task
this
would
lead
the
child
to
see
that
nothing
was
demanded
out
of
caprice
or
whim
but
that
it
was
a
requirement
involving
happiness
as
well
as
duty
this
method
would
also
teach
the
child
to
reverence
and
respect
the
parent
she
would
be
regarded
as
possessed
of
superior
knowledge
and
he
would
the
more
readily
undertake
demands
for
which
he
could
see
no
reason
from
a
knowledge
that
no
commands
of
which
he
understood
the
design
were
ever
unreasonable
the
manner
of
behaving
to
children
should
be
one
of
kindness
though
marked
by
decision
of
character
an
over
fondness
should
never
allow
a
mother
to
gratify
her
child
in
any
thing
unreasonable
and
after
having
once
refused
a
request
which
she
should
not
do
hastily
or
unadvisedly
no
coaxing
or
tears
should
divert
her
from
her
purpose
for
if
she
gives
way
the
child
will
at
once
understand
that
he
has
a
power
over
his
mother
and
will
resort
to
the
same
expedient
whenever
occasion
may
require
and
a
worse
evil
than
this
is
that
respect
for
the
parent
will
be
lost
and
the
child
in
place
of
yielding
readily
to
her
wishes
will
try
means
of
trick
and
evasion
to
elude
them
in
order
to
really
manage
a
child
well
a
mother
should
become
a
child
herself
she
should
enter
into
its
hopes
and
fears
and
share
its
joys
and
sorrows
she
should
bend
down
her
mind
to
that
of
her
offspring
so
as
to
be
pleased
with
all
those
trivial
actions
which
give
it
pleasure
and
to
sorrow
over
those
which
bring
it
pain
this
would
secure
a
love
firm
and
ardent
and
at
the
same
time
lasting
for
as
a
child
advanced
in
strength
of
intellect
so
might
the
mother
until
the
child
grew
old
enough
to
understand
the
ties
which
bound
them
and
then
by
making
him
a
friend
she
would
bind
him
to
her
for
life
there
are
none
of
the
human
race
so
sagacious
and
keensighted
as
children
they
seem
to
understand
intuitively
a
disposition
and
they
quickly
notice
any
discrepancies
or
inconsistencies
of
conduct
on
this
point
should
particular
attention
be
paid
that
there
be
nothing
practised
to
cheat
the
child
underhand
means
are
frequently
resorted
to
to
persuade
a
child
to
perform
or
abstain
from
some
particular
duty
or
object
but
in
a
very
short
time
it
will
be
found
out
and
the
child
has
been
taught
a
lesson
in
deception
which
it
will
not
fail
to
use
when
occasion
requires
and
under
this
head
might
be
included
all
that
petty
species
of
deceit
used
towards
children
whether
to
mislead
their
apprehension
or
to
divert
their
attention
if
any
thing
be
improper
for
a
child
to
know
or
do
better
tell
him
so
at
once
than
resort
to
an
underhand
expedient
if
a
reason
can
be
given
for
requiring
the
abstinence
it
should
but
if
not
tell
the
child
that
the
reason
is
such
that
he
could
not
comprehend
it
and
he
will
remain
satisfied
but
if
trick
or
scheming
be
resorted
to
the
child
will
have
learned
the
two
improper
lessons
of
first
being
cunning
and
then
telling
a
falsehood
to
avoid
it
in
whatever
way
you
wish
to
act
upon
a
child
always
propose
the
highest
and
noblest
motive
this
will
generally
be
a
motive
which
centres
in
god
thus
in
teaching
a
child
to
speak
the
truth
it
should
be
proposed
not
so
much
out
of
obedience
to
parents
as
out
of
obedience
to
god
and
in
all
requirements
the
love
and
fear
of
god
should
be
prominently
set
forth
a
child
is
born
with
feelings
of
religion
and
if
these
feelings
are
properly
called
forth
the
actions
will
generally
have
a
tendency
to
good
thus
with
a
child
whose
disposition
is
to
deceive
a
mother
has
no
hold
upon
such
an
one
for
the
child
will
soon
perceive
that
his
mother
can
not
follow
him
every
where
and
that
he
can
commit
with
impunity
many
actions
of
deceit
but
impress
the
child
with
the
truth
that
a
being
is
watching
these
actions
and
that
though
done
with
the
greatest
cunning
they
can
not
be
committed
with
impunity
and
it
is
more
than
probable
that
they
will
never
be
committed
at
all
a
temptation
may
be
thrown
in
the
way
of
such
a
child
but
it
will
not
be
powerful
enough
to
overcome
the
feeling
that
the
action
is
watched
that
child
may
eagerly
pant
to
perform
the
forbidden
action
or
to
partake
of
the
forbidden
pleasure
but
he
will
not
be
able
to
rid
himself
of
the
feeling
that
it
can
not
be
done
without
being
observed
he
will
stand
in
a
state
of
anxiety
and
steal
a
glance
around
in
order
to
see
the
being
he
feels
is
looking
upon
him
and
every
breeze
that
murmurs
will
be
a
voice
to
chide
him
and
every
leaf
that
whistles
will
seem
a
footstep
and
never
will
he
be
able
to
break
the
restraint
for
wherever
he
goes
and
whatever
he
does
he
will
feel
that
his
actions
are
watched
by
one
who
will
punish
the
bad
and
reward
the
good
and
in
the
same
way
might
this
be
applied
to
all
dispositions
and
feelings
how
cheering
is
it
to
a
timid
child
to
be
told
that
at
no
time
is
he
left
alone
but
that
the
being
who
made
every
thing
preserves
and
keeps
every
thing
and
that
nothing
can
happen
but
by
his
permission
this
is
to
disarm
fear
of
its
terrors
and
to
implant
a
confidence
in
the
mind
for
the
child
will
feel
that
while
his
actions
are
good
he
is
under
the
protection
of
an
almighty
parent
in
the
same
way
in
stimulating
a
child
to
the
performance
of
a
duty
the
end
proposed
should
be
the
favour
of
god
this
would
insure
the
duty
being
entered
upon
with
a
right
spirit
not
merely
for
the
sake
of
show
and
effect
but
springing
from
the
heart
and
the
mind
and
at
the
same
time
it
would
prevent
any
thing
of
hypocrisy
if
it
were
only
the
estimation
of
the
world
which
was
to
be
regarded
a
child
could
soon
understand
that
the
applause
would
be
gained
by
the
mere
exterior
performance
be
the
motive
what
it
might
but
when
the
motive
is
centered
in
god
it
is
readily
understood
that
the
feeling
must
be
genuine
otherwise
whatever
the
world
may
say
god
will
look
upon
it
as
unworthy
and
base
we
believe
it
would
be
found
to
work
the
best
results
if
all
the
actions
of
a
child
were
made
thus
to
depend
upon
their
harmony
with
the
will
of
god
for
it
would
give
a
sacredness
to
every
action
make
every
motive
a
high
and
holy
one
and
harmonise
the
thoughts
of
the
heart
with
the
actions
of
the
life
but
in
this
mode
of
teaching
it
is
essentially
necessary
that
a
mother
should
herself
be
an
example
of
the
truth
she
teaches
it
will
be
worse
than
useless
to
teach
a
child
that
god
is
always
at
hand
spieth
out
all
our
ways
if
she
act
as
though
she
did
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
deity
in
the
same
way
will
it
hold
good
of
every
requirement
it
will
be
vain
to
teach
a
child
that
lying
is
a
great
crime
in
god
sight
when
a
mother
in
her
own
words
shows
no
regard
to
truth
and
equally
so
of
all
other
passions
and
feelings
it
is
idle
to
teach
a
child
that
pride
hatred
revenge
anger
are
unholy
passions
if
a
mother
own
conduct
displays
either
of
them
how
useless
is
it
to
teach
that
vanity
should
never
be
indulged
in
when
a
mother
delights
in
display
such
instruction
as
this
is
like
the
web
of
penelope
unpicked
as
fast
as
done
the
greatest
reverence
is
due
to
a
child
and
previously
to
becoming
a
teacher
a
mother
should
learn
this
hardest
of
all
lessons
thyself
without
this
the
instruction
she
gives
her
children
will
at
best
prove
very
imperfect
it
is
quite
useless
to
teach
children
to
reverence
any
thing
when
a
mother
conduct
shows
that
practically
at
least
she
has
no
belief
in
the
truths
she
inculcates
and
a
very
hard
requirement
this
is
but
it
is
a
requirement
absolutely
necessary
if
education
is
meant
to
be
any
thing
more
than
nominal
the
finest
lesson
on
the
beauty
of
truth
is
enforced
by
a
mother
never
herself
saying
what
is
false
for
children
pay
great
regard
to
consistency
and
very
soon
detect
any
discrepancies
between
that
which
is
taught
and
that
which
is
practised
the
best
method
of
inculcating
truth
on
the
minds
of
children
is
by
analogy
and
illustration
they
can
not
follow
an
argument
though
they
readily
understand
a
comparison
and
by
a
judicious
arrangement
every
thing
either
animate
or
inanimate
might
be
made
to
become
a
teacher
what
lesson
on
industry
would
be
so
likely
to
be
instructive
as
that
gathered
from
a
the
longest
dissertation
on
the
evils
of
idleness
and
the
advantages
of
industry
would
not
prove
half
so
beneficial
as
directing
the
observation
to
the
movements
of
the
bee
that
insect
which
without
the
aid
of
reason
exercises
prudence
and
foresight
and
provides
against
the
wants
of
winter
a
child
will
readily
understand
such
instruction
as
this
and
will
blush
to
be
found
spending
precious
hours
in
idleness
and
in
the
same
way
with
other
duties
whether
to
god
or
mankind
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
the
flowers
of
the
field
might
be
made
profitable
teachers
and
the
child
would
wherever
he
went
be
surrounded
with
instruction
this
mode
of
teaching
has
this
special
recommendation
it
raises
up
no
evil
passions
and
a
child
which
would
display
an
evil
temper
by
being
reproved
in
words
will
feel
no
such
rancor
at
a
lesson
being
inculcated
in
a
way
like
this
this
instruction
will
also
be
much
longer
remembered
than
one
delivered
in
words
forasmuch
as
the
object
upon
which
the
instruction
is
based
would
be
continually
presented
to
the
eye
and
we
believe
almost
all
duties
might
be
inculcated
in
this
manner
thus
humility
by
the
lily
patience
by
the
spider
affection
by
the
dove
love
to
parents
by
the
stork
all
might
be
rendered
teachers
and
in
a
way
never
to
be
forgotten
and
that
this
mode
of
teaching
is
the
best
we
have
the
example
of
christ
himself
who
almost
invariably
enforced
his
instructions
by
an
allusion
to
some
created
thing
what
for
instance
was
so
likely
to
teach
men
dependence
upon
god
as
a
reference
to
the
and
the
lilies
which
without
the
aid
of
reason
had
their
wants
cared
for
and
in
the
same
way
with
children
what
is
so
likely
to
teach
them
their
duties
as
a
reference
to
the
varied
things
in
nature
with
whose
uses
and
habits
they
are
well
acquainted
god
should
be
the
object
upon
which
the
child
thoughts
are
taught
to
dwell
for
the
minds
even
of
children
turn
to
the
beautiful
and
the
beautiful
is
the
divine
all
thoughts
and
actions
should
be
raised
to
this
standard
and
the
child
would
raise
above
the
feelings
of
and
vanity
and
the
panting
for
applause
to
the
favor
and
love
of
god
thus
should
religion
be
the
great
and
the
first
thing
taught
and
a
mother
should
be
careful
that
neither
in
her
own
actions
nor
in
the
motives
she
holds
out
to
her
children
should
there
be
any
thing
inimical
or
contrary
to
religion
and
by
this
course
the
best
and
happiest
results
may
be
expected
to
follow
the
perverse
and
headstrong
passions
of
the
human
heart
are
so
many
that
numerous
instructions
may
seem
to
be
useless
and
a
mother
may
have
often
to
sigh
over
her
child
as
she
sees
him
allowing
evil
habits
to
obtain
the
mastery
or
unholy
dispositions
to
reign
in
his
heart
but
as
we
have
before
said
we
do
not
think
that
the
instruction
will
be
lost
but
that
a
time
will
come
when
she
will
reap
the
fruits
of
her
toil
care
and
anxiety
such
then
is
the
duty
of
woman
as
a
mother
to
tend
and
watch
over
the
wants
of
her
child
to
guard
it
in
health
to
nurse
it
in
sickness
to
be
solicitous
for
it
in
all
the
changes
of
life
and
to
prevent
as
much
as
possible
those
many
ills
to
which
flesh
is
heir
from
assailing
her
fondly
cherished
offspring
it
is
also
her
province
to
instruct
her
children
in
those
duties
which
will
fall
to
their
lot
both
as
reasonable
and
as
immortal
creatures
and
by
so
doing
she
will
make
her
own
life
happy
leave
to
her
children
a
happy
heritage
on
earth
and
a
prospect
of
a
higher
one
in
heaven
but
if
a
mother
neglect
her
duty
she
will
reap
the
fruits
of
her
own
negligence
in
the
ingratitude
of
her
children
an
ingratitude
which
will
bring
a
double
pain
to
her
from
the
thought
that
her
own
neglect
was
the
cause
of
its
growth
as
an
eagle
with
an
arrow
in
his
heart
might
be
supposed
to
feel
an
agony
above
that
of
pain
on
seeing
the
shaft
now
draining
its
life
blood
feathered
from
its
own
wing
child
in
her
excellent
mother
book
a
volume
that
should
be
in
the
hands
of
every
woman
who
has
assumed
the
responsibilities
of
a
parent
gives
some
valuable
suggestions
on
the
subject
of
governing
children
i
make
a
single
extract
and
with
it
close
my
present
rambling
work
she
says
some
children
from
errors
in
early
management
get
possessed
with
the
idea
that
they
may
have
every
thing
they
even
tease
for
things
it
would
be
impossible
to
give
them
a
child
properly
managed
will
seldom
ask
twice
for
what
you
have
once
told
him
he
should
not
have
but
if
you
have
the
care
of
one
who
has
acquired
this
habit
the
best
way
to
cure
him
of
it
is
never
to
give
him
what
he
asks
for
whether
his
request
is
proper
or
not
but
at
the
same
time
be
careful
to
give
him
such
things
as
he
likes
provided
they
are
proper
for
him
when
he
does
not
ask
for
them
this
will
soon
break
him
of
the
habit
of
teasing
i
have
said
much
in
praise
of
gentleness
i
can
not
say
too
much
its
effects
are
beyond
calculation
both
on
the
affections
and
the
understanding
the
victims
of
oppression
and
abuse
are
generally
stupid
as
well
as
selfish
and
how
can
we
wonder
at
it
they
are
all
the
time
excited
to
evil
passions
and
nobody
encourages
what
is
good
in
them
we
might
as
well
expect
flowers
to
grow
amid
the
cold
and
storm
of
winter
but
gentleness
important
as
it
is
is
not
all
that
is
required
in
education
there
should
be
united
with
it
firmness
great
firmness
commands
should
be
reasonable
and
given
in
perfect
kindness
but
once
given
it
should
be
known
that
they
must
be
obeyed
i
heard
a
lady
once
say
my
part
i
can
not
be
so
very
strict
with
my
children
i
love
them
too
much
to
punish
them
every
time
they
disobey
me
i
will
relate
a
scene
which
took
place
in
her
family
she
had
but
one
domestic
and
at
the
time
to
which
i
allude
she
was
very
busy
preparing
for
company
her
children
knew
by
experience
that
when
she
was
in
a
hurry
she
would
indulge
them
in
any
thing
for
the
sake
of
having
them
out
of
the
way
george
began
i
want
a
piece
of
the
answer
was
is
nearly
and
will
hurt
you
you
shall
have
a
piece
of
cake
if
you
will
sit
down
and
be
still
the
boy
ate
his
cake
and
liking
the
system
of
being
hired
to
sit
still
he
soon
began
again
i
want
a
piece
of
the
old
answer
was
repeated
the
child
stood
his
ground
i
want
a
piece
of
i
a
piece
i
a
piece
was
repeated
incessantly
you
leave
off
teasing
if
i
give
you
a
piece
i
will
certain
true
a
small
piece
was
given
and
soon
devoured
with
his
mouth
half
full
he
began
again
want
another
piece
i
want
another
piece
george
i
shall
not
give
you
another
mouthful
go
sit
down
you
naughty
boy
you
always
act
the
worst
when
i
am
going
to
have
company
george
continued
his
teasing
and
at
last
said
you
do
give
me
another
piece
i
roar
this
threat
not
being
attended
to
he
kept
his
word
upon
this
the
mother
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
shook
him
angrily
saying
your
tongue
you
naughty
boy
will
if
you
will
give
me
another
piece
of
pie
said
he
another
small
piece
was
given
him
after
he
had
promised
that
he
certainly
would
not
tease
any
more
as
soon
as
he
had
eaten
it
he
of
course
began
again
and
with
the
additional
threat
you
do
give
me
a
piece
i
will
roar
after
the
company
comes
so
loud
that
they
can
all
hear
me
the
end
of
all
this
was
that
the
boy
had
a
sound
whipping
was
put
to
bed
and
could
not
sleep
all
night
because
the
made
his
stomach
ache
what
an
accumulation
of
evils
in
this
little
scene
his
health
injured
his
promises
broken
with
impunity
his
mother
promises
broken
the
knowledge
gained
that
he
could
always
vex
her
when
she
was
in
a
hurry
and
that
he
could
gain
what
he
would
by
teasing
he
always
acted
upon
the
same
plan
afterward
for
he
only
once
in
a
while
when
he
made
his
mother
very
angry
got
a
whipping
but
he
was
sure
to
obtain
what
he
asked
for
if
he
teased
her
long
enough
his
mother
told
him
the
plain
truth
when
she
said
the
would
hurt
him
but
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
the
truth
or
whether
she
only
said
it
to
put
him
off
for
he
knew
that
she
did
sometimes
deceive
when
she
gave
him
the
pie
he
had
reason
to
suppose
it
was
not
true
it
would
hurt
him
else
why
should
a
kind
mother
give
it
to
her
child
had
she
told
him
that
if
he
asked
a
second
time
she
would
put
him
to
bed
directly
and
had
she
kept
her
promise
in
spite
of
entreaties
she
would
have
saved
him
a
whipping
and
herself
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
trouble
and
who
can
calculate
all
the
whippings
and
all
the
trouble
she
would
have
spared
herself
and
him
i
do
not
remember
ever
being
in
her
house
half
a
day
without
witnessing
some
scene
of
contention
with
the
children
now
let
me
introduce
you
to
another
acquaintance
she
was
in
precisely
the
same
situation
having
a
comfortable
income
and
one
domestic
but
her
children
were
much
more
numerous
and
she
had
had
very
limited
advantages
for
education
yet
she
managed
her
family
better
than
any
woman
i
ever
saw
or
ever
expect
to
see
again
i
will
relate
a
scene
i
witnessed
there
by
way
of
contrast
to
the
one
i
have
just
described
myself
and
several
friends
once
entered
her
parlor
unexpectedly
just
as
the
family
were
seated
at
the
a
little
girl
about
four
years
old
was
obliged
to
be
removed
to
make
room
for
us
her
mother
assured
her
she
should
have
her
supper
in
a
little
while
if
she
was
a
good
girl
the
child
cried
and
the
guests
insisted
that
room
should
be
made
for
her
at
table
said
the
mother
have
told
her
she
must
wait
and
if
she
cries
i
shall
be
obliged
to
send
her
to
bed
if
she
is
a
good
little
girl
she
shall
have
her
supper
directly
the
child
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
obey
and
her
mother
led
her
out
of
the
room
and
gave
orders
that
she
should
be
put
to
bed
without
supper
when
my
friend
returned
her
husband
said
that
was
a
hard
case
the
poor
child
lost
her
supper
and
was
agitated
by
the
presence
of
strangers
i
could
hardly
keep
from
taking
her
on
my
knee
and
giving
her
some
supper
poor
little
thing
but
i
never
will
interfere
with
your
management
and
much
as
it
went
against
my
feelings
i
entirely
approve
of
what
you
have
done
cost
me
a
struggle
replied
his
wife
i
know
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
child
to
be
taught
that
i
mean
exactly
what
i
say
this
family
was
the
most
harmonious
affectionate
happy
family
i
ever
knew
the
children
were
managed
as
easily
as
a
flock
of
lambs
after
a
few
unsuccessful
attempts
at
disobedience
when
very
young
they
gave
it
up
entirely
and
always
cheerfully
acted
from
the
conviction
that
their
mother
knew
best
this
family
was
governed
with
great
strictness
firmness
was
united
with
gentleness
the
indulgent
mother
who
said
she
loved
her
children
too
much
to
punish
them
was
actually
obliged
to
punish
them
ten
times
as
much
as
the
strict
mother
did
the
end
